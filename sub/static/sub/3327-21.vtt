00:02.257 --> 00:03.849
<i>Previously, on</i> Elementary...

00:03.874 --> 00:06.434
HOLMES: <i>He is, without question,</i>
<i>the most sinister taker of lives</i>

00:06.630 --> 00:08.847
I have ever had the displeasure
<i>of pursuing.</i>

00:08.849 --> 00:11.016
I have no intention
of capturing M.

00:11.772 --> 00:13.438
<i>I have every intention</i>

00:13.440 --> 00:15.106
of torturing and murdering him.

00:15.108 --> 00:17.559
You-you don't mind
if I call you M?

00:17.561 --> 00:19.477
Sebastian Moran--
that's my real name.

00:19.479 --> 00:21.946
MORAN: <i>He sends me coded message</i>
<i>on me cell phone.</i>

00:21.948 --> 00:23.648
You can kill me
for all the others,

00:23.650 --> 00:24.866
but your girl,

00:24.868 --> 00:26.117
<i>that was him.</i>

00:26.119 --> 00:28.570
<i>That was Moriarty.</i>

00:34.043 --> 00:35.743
MAN:
Uh, don't forget to remind me

00:35.745 --> 00:37.629
to call a meeting
of the Endowment Committee.

00:37.631 --> 00:39.831
Thanks, Beverly.

00:40.866 --> 00:43.218
(sighs)

00:45.204 --> 00:47.338
(liquor pouring)

00:48.174 --> 00:50.508
(sighs)

00:50.510 --> 00:51.593
(electronic tone whining)

00:51.595 --> 00:52.844
(grunts in pain)

00:52.846 --> 00:55.563
(electronic whine continues)
(yells)

00:55.565 --> 00:56.931
(groans)

00:57.883 --> 00:59.651
(tone stops)

00:59.653 --> 01:02.036
(gasping)

01:03.272 --> 01:05.940
But you don't have
to call for help.

01:05.942 --> 01:07.859
You aren't having
a heart attack.

01:07.861 --> 01:09.110
Who the hell are you?

01:09.112 --> 01:11.830
Just someone who's
been studying you.

01:11.832 --> 01:13.883
You've been dependent
on a pacemaker for the

01:13.908 --> 01:15.889
past seven years.

01:18.103 --> 01:20.755
(electronic tone whines)
(groans loudly)

01:20.757 --> 01:22.774
I'm doing that to you.

01:22.776 --> 01:24.709
Watch.

01:24.711 --> 01:26.961
(whine stops)
See?

01:26.963 --> 01:29.047
(panting)
Every pacemaker

01:29.049 --> 01:31.432
has its own unique
identifying number.

01:31.434 --> 01:33.384
If you've got that,

01:33.386 --> 01:35.720
you can make
that little box in your chest

01:35.722 --> 01:37.255
do all sorts of things--

01:37.257 --> 01:38.723
things like send

01:38.725 --> 01:40.575
several hundred volts
through your body

01:40.577 --> 01:42.593
with just the push of a button.

01:42.595 --> 01:43.945
Wait! Stop!

01:43.947 --> 01:46.281
(gasping):
What do you want?

01:46.283 --> 01:49.817
Nothing, really;
I'm happy just to watch you die.

01:49.819 --> 01:52.770
It would look like a
heart attack, you know.

01:52.772 --> 01:55.123
But, then...

01:55.125 --> 01:59.460
I'm not representing
my own interest tonight.

01:59.462 --> 02:01.462
Cast your ballot.

02:01.464 --> 02:03.748
My ballot?

02:03.750 --> 02:05.950
That's what this is all about?

02:05.952 --> 02:09.888
Vote to revoke,
and I'll be on my way.

02:09.889 --> 02:11.923
All right.

the Arsenal game.

Phillip Van Der Hoff...

03:10.317 --> 03:11.649
(indistinct chatter)

03:11.651 --> 03:13.234
MORAN:
Quiet!

03:13.236 --> 03:15.119
Go back to the news.

03:15.121 --> 03:18.039
NEWSWOMAN: ...Van Der Hoff's
wife was vacationing in Austria,

03:18.041 --> 03:20.875
but is said to be
on her way home this morning.

03:20.877 --> 03:23.077
(Holmes grunting loudly)

03:23.079 --> 03:24.495
Is everything okay?

03:24.497 --> 03:26.530
Yeah. Fine.

03:26.532 --> 03:28.216
It's good that you're
here, actually.

03:28.218 --> 03:30.218
You kn...
you know how to...

03:30.220 --> 03:31.970
reset a dislocated shoulder.

03:31.972 --> 03:33.805
And you dislocated your
own shoulder because...?

03:33.807 --> 03:36.090
Are you thick?
Am <i>I</i> thick? You are the one

03:36.092 --> 03:37.375
stuck in a straitjacket.

03:37.377 --> 03:39.543
Why are you...?
It had been too long.

03:39.545 --> 03:41.012
(grunts)

03:41.014 --> 03:42.347
(yells)

03:42.349 --> 03:44.148
(panting):
Please.

03:44.150 --> 03:45.216
Okay.

03:45.218 --> 03:46.517
(ringtone chiming)
Ow...

03:46.519 --> 03:48.052
Looks like an
anterior dislocation.

03:48.054 --> 03:50.104
(ringtone continues)
Yeah-- ow!

03:50.106 --> 03:51.322
(panting)

03:51.324 --> 03:53.157
Actually, could you just...

03:53.159 --> 03:54.158
wait a moment...

03:54.160 --> 03:55.827
(grunts)
(yells)

03:55.829 --> 03:57.612
What was that?

03:57.614 --> 04:00.248
(relieved sigh) I'm gonna get
you some ice.

04:00.250 --> 04:02.417
(groaning)

04:02.419 --> 04:03.868
Hi.

04:03.870 --> 04:06.037
You okay?
Yes, I'm fine. How are you?

04:06.039 --> 04:07.571
Listen, I just got a call

04:07.573 --> 04:09.757
from the warden at Newgate.

04:09.759 --> 04:13.311
Sebastian Moran just got out
of a stint in solitary.

04:13.313 --> 04:15.046
I don't know
if he had an epiphany

04:15.048 --> 04:17.081
during all that downtime,
but he claims

04:17.083 --> 04:19.716
there are more people
he was ordered to kill;

04:19.719 --> 04:21.719
victims he never
told anyone about.

04:21.721 --> 04:23.254
He wants to confess.

04:23.256 --> 04:24.722
Well, bully for him.

04:24.724 --> 04:26.057
On one condition:

04:26.059 --> 04:29.143
the only person
he'll talk to is you.

04:29.145 --> 04:30.795
(door lock buzzes)

04:30.797 --> 04:33.114
How are you, Sherlock?

04:37.102 --> 04:38.986
How are you?

04:43.792 --> 04:46.077
Thanks, Will.

04:47.079 --> 04:49.297
I've got something
new for you.

04:49.299 --> 04:51.999
'Cause you and me,
we both want the same thing.

04:52.001 --> 04:54.168
To get rid of him.

04:55.437 --> 04:58.056
So it's to be another
tale of Moriarty.

04:58.058 --> 05:00.091
Shh.

05:01.510 --> 05:04.128
He's got ears and eyes
everywhere in here.

05:04.130 --> 05:07.815
I want him because
he set me up to be caught by you...

05:07.817 --> 05:11.319
and for the two mugs he sent
in here who tried to shiv me.

05:11.321 --> 05:13.404
And you...

05:13.406 --> 05:16.407
you want him 'cause
he killed your girl.

05:16.409 --> 05:20.111
Mr. Moran, your claims
about Moriarty

05:20.113 --> 05:23.647
cannot be substantiated
and are of no interest.

05:23.649 --> 05:26.117
Now, I was told you
had some information

05:26.119 --> 05:28.536
about some other
of your victims.

05:29.821 --> 05:32.790
And I was told, every year
about Christmastime,

05:32.792 --> 05:35.676
a fat, jolly old man
delivers toffees

05:35.678 --> 05:37.345
to good little
girls and boys.

05:37.347 --> 05:39.380
Now, I waited up
for him one night

05:39.382 --> 05:42.350
to steal his stash...
but he didn't show.

05:44.937 --> 05:48.740
Will... show Sherlock
the article.

05:50.743 --> 05:53.344
He had me
cut this out.

05:58.700 --> 06:00.902
That was no accident.

06:00.904 --> 06:03.154
That was ordered by him.

06:09.962 --> 06:12.213
This man died of
a heart attack.

06:12.215 --> 06:14.882
What makes you think there
was someone else involved?

06:14.884 --> 06:17.668
Because before you
nicked me in Harlem,

06:17.670 --> 06:20.805
I had a text with
that man's face on it...

06:20.807 --> 06:23.057
and the order was:

06:23.059 --> 06:25.676
"String him up
just like the others."

06:25.678 --> 06:27.845
Now, you find out
who killed Van Der Hoff,

06:27.847 --> 06:31.232
and you'll be
one step closer to him.

06:31.234 --> 06:33.267
To Moriarty.

06:34.153 --> 06:36.521
(key rattling in lock)
MORAN: Will.

06:42.394 --> 06:44.245
Oh.

06:44.247 --> 06:46.164
And one more thing:

06:46.166 --> 06:48.399
When they ask you
what happened here today,

06:48.401 --> 06:50.251
keep it quiet.

06:50.253 --> 06:52.036
What happened?

06:53.555 --> 06:55.873
HOLMES:
Get away from him!

06:55.875 --> 06:58.092
(grunting)

06:59.127 --> 07:00.511
MORAN:
Too late, boys.

07:00.513 --> 07:02.413
(laughs):
No medic needed.

07:02.415 --> 07:04.048
No medic.

07:04.050 --> 07:05.249

Original Air Date on May 2, 2013

07:20.186 --> 07:25.186
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00FF00">elderman</font> ==

07:26.909 --> 07:28.410
The other guards say
he had his finger

07:28.412 --> 07:30.445
to his lips while
they were dragging him off,

07:30.447 --> 07:32.146
like he was telling you
to be quiet.

07:32.148 --> 07:34.783
According to your statement,
he just issued

07:34.785 --> 07:37.335
a bunch of threats,
called off the meeting,

07:37.337 --> 07:38.453
then attacked
the guard, so...

07:38.455 --> 07:40.021
what's to be quiet about?

07:40.023 --> 07:43.158
I'm afraid I have no idea.

07:46.379 --> 07:49.381
Hey. Let's talk.

07:55.805 --> 07:58.223
You have been training me
to ferret out lies.

07:58.225 --> 08:00.025
When Captain Gregson
asked you

08:00.027 --> 08:02.227
what Moran wanted you
to keep quiet about,

08:02.229 --> 08:03.728
you hesitated.

08:03.730 --> 08:05.914
That doesn't prove deceit--
it's a feint,

08:05.916 --> 08:08.066
designed to sharpen
your deductive skills.

08:08.068 --> 08:09.534
Okay, the last time
you like about Moran

08:09.536 --> 08:10.986
you were planning
to torture and kill him.

08:10.988 --> 08:12.571
I was quite honest
about my intentions.

08:12.573 --> 08:14.789
Okay, what if these impulses
get triggered again?

08:14.791 --> 08:16.024
You're not longer required

08:16.026 --> 08:17.358
to play hall monitor
to my impulses.

08:17.360 --> 08:19.001
Okay, but I am allowed
to be concerned.

08:19.026 --> 08:20.228
Mm.

08:22.331 --> 08:24.799
Just so you know, I intended
to share this with you,

08:24.801 --> 08:26.801
just not here.

08:26.803 --> 08:30.872
Moran told me that Moriarty
was behind that man's death;

08:30.874 --> 08:33.692
that he himself was once
contracted to kill him.

08:33.693 --> 08:35.092
Now, I understand your concern,

08:35.095 --> 08:37.544
but this is not
history repeating itself.

08:37.547 --> 08:39.681
Okay, then what's different?

08:39.683 --> 08:41.433
You're getting ahead
of yourself, Watson.

08:41.434 --> 08:43.818
Moran has proven himself to be
extremely unreliable.

08:43.820 --> 08:46.988
I would like to make sure these
are not his paranoid ravings

08:46.990 --> 08:49.774
before I involve Captain Gregson
or anyone else.

08:49.776 --> 08:52.393
Fortunately, it should be
quite simple to find out

08:52.395 --> 08:53.561
if there was anything
suspicious

08:53.563 --> 08:54.996
about that man's death.

08:54.998 --> 08:57.198
You have a copy
of his autopsy report?

08:57.200 --> 08:59.200
Phillip Van Der Hoff
was a middle-aged man

08:59.202 --> 09:00.452
with a known heart condition.

09:00.454 --> 09:02.070
There was no autopsy.

09:02.072 --> 09:04.172
His body was released to the
mortuary this afternoon.

09:04.174 --> 09:07.709
Flowers are to be sent to the
McTierney Brothers Funeral Home.

09:07.711 --> 09:10.095
What, you want to send
a bouquet and a card?

09:10.097 --> 09:11.346
"With deepest sympathy.

09:11.348 --> 09:13.014
P.S.: This may
have been murder."

09:13.016 --> 09:14.633
Not exactly.

09:14.635 --> 09:16.651
WATSON:
So you prove you're reasonable

09:16.653 --> 09:19.087
by asking me to commit a felony.

09:19.089 --> 09:20.939
Security in mortuaries
is so lax

09:20.941 --> 09:23.975
you can hardly call it
breaking and entering.

09:26.929 --> 09:28.813
Embalmed.

09:29.699 --> 09:31.599
Embalmed.

09:31.601 --> 09:34.819
You say that like you've broken
into funeral parlors before.

09:34.821 --> 09:38.823
Well, there was a certain
problem of Thor Bridge...

09:41.377 --> 09:43.745
Yes.

09:49.085 --> 09:50.952
As I'd hoped,

09:50.954 --> 09:53.755
not scheduled for embalming
until the morning.

09:54.557 --> 09:55.957
Yep.

10:01.964 --> 10:03.631
Well, he had a pacemaker.

10:03.633 --> 10:05.734
And his heart condition
checks out.

10:05.736 --> 10:08.269
Hm.

10:08.271 --> 10:10.021
Yep.

10:11.607 --> 10:14.659
No sign of any defensive wounds.

10:14.661 --> 10:16.695
No skin under his fingernails.

10:17.697 --> 10:18.980
Ah.

10:21.316 --> 10:23.284
Hm.

10:23.286 --> 10:25.587
He has four small
bruises on each palm.

10:25.589 --> 10:27.488
He's clenched
his fists so tightly,

10:27.490 --> 10:29.124
his fingers have left bruises.

10:29.126 --> 10:30.375
I've heard about that in people

10:30.377 --> 10:31.760
who have been struck
by lightning,

10:31.762 --> 10:33.261
and electrocuted
on the third rail, but...

10:33.263 --> 10:35.296
but it's not consistent
with a heart attack.

10:35.298 --> 10:36.664
Agreed.

10:36.666 --> 10:37.599
We'll have to proceed.

10:37.601 --> 10:38.600
Seriously?

10:38.602 --> 10:40.135
Mm.
But what happens

10:40.137 --> 10:42.053
when people figure out
that somebody came in here

10:42.055 --> 10:43.722
and cut up a body
in the middle of the night?

10:43.724 --> 10:45.298
We'll sew him back up
again, won't we?

10:45.323 --> 10:46.225
What?

10:46.226 --> 10:48.610
Any luck, they'll assume that autopsy
was done at the hospital,

10:48.612 --> 10:51.529
or they might just put it down
to a paperwork error, I don't know.

10:51.531 --> 10:52.782
Anyway, they're certainly
not gonna assume

10:52.807 --> 10:53.962
two people broke in
in the middle of the

10:53.963 --> 10:56.511
night and performed an
illicit autopsy, are they?

10:56.653 --> 10:58.870
Right, because
that would be crazy.

10:59.488 --> 11:01.206
(chuckles)
No.

11:01.707 --> 11:03.992
No.

11:03.994 --> 11:05.710
(exhales)

11:05.712 --> 11:07.495
Fine.

11:08.547 --> 11:09.547
No, no.

11:09.549 --> 11:11.883
From the shoulder.

11:11.885 --> 11:13.134
(Holmes muttering)

11:13.136 --> 11:14.836
Hm?

11:16.005 --> 11:17.889
Y-You need to
press harder.

11:17.891 --> 11:19.057
All right.

11:19.059 --> 11:21.643
Harder!
Mm.

11:21.645 --> 11:23.511
You're using
the wrong...

11:23.513 --> 11:25.546
Okay, just stop.

11:25.548 --> 11:27.565
(whispers): Stop.

11:27.567 --> 11:29.417
(sighs heavily)

11:31.353 --> 11:33.554
Just give it to me.

11:43.165 --> 11:44.449
Mm...

11:47.169 --> 11:49.370
Mm...

11:49.372 --> 11:50.905
Oh, that's lovely.

11:50.907 --> 11:52.907
You really are
quite skilled, Watson.

11:52.909 --> 11:54.575
No.

11:54.577 --> 11:56.744
I am dissecting a body
in the middle of the night.

11:56.746 --> 11:59.047
We are not having a moment.

12:07.022 --> 12:09.357
(sighs): Okay, well,
there's no broken ribs.

12:09.359 --> 12:11.693
I mean, I really can't
see the heart from here.

12:11.695 --> 12:13.895
I would need a saw
and a rib spreader,

12:13.897 --> 12:15.563
which I'm guessing
you don't have.

12:17.817 --> 12:19.984
Okay, let's, uh...

12:21.904 --> 12:23.938
Oh, this is strange.

12:23.940 --> 12:25.373
Look at this.

12:25.375 --> 12:27.909
See how the blood
is coagulated

12:27.911 --> 12:29.461
and the capillaries...

12:29.463 --> 12:32.080
have bubbles
burnt into them.

12:32.082 --> 12:34.983
Looks like his
blood boiled.

12:36.752 --> 12:39.471
One has to admire the sheer
Promethean ingenuity.

12:39.473 --> 12:41.622
Can one do that

12:41.624 --> 12:42.974
after one gets some sleep?

12:42.976 --> 12:44.843
The marks on Phillip
Van Der Hoff's hands

12:44.845 --> 12:46.460
were consistent
with electrocution.

12:46.462 --> 12:48.980
His blood boiled from the heat
of an electric shock,

12:48.982 --> 12:50.798
which was directly
on his heart.

12:50.800 --> 12:52.233
How does one
achieve that?

12:52.235 --> 12:55.153
By using his pacemaker
as a weapon.

12:55.155 --> 12:57.438
Or it could've
just gone haywire.

12:57.440 --> 12:59.640
They malfunction about
six percent of the time.

12:59.642 --> 13:01.309
Have a look at this.

13:01.311 --> 13:02.977
Premier Cardiac Monitoring,

13:02.979 --> 13:05.830
the country's leading
manufacturer of pacemakers.

13:05.832 --> 13:08.783
They just issued a press release
announcing start of work

13:08.785 --> 13:11.703
on a device
which cannot be hacked.

13:12.671 --> 13:14.405
WATSON:
That would imply that

13:14.407 --> 13:15.840
it <i>is</i> possible to
hack a pacemaker.

13:15.842 --> 13:17.559
It makes perfect sense.
If you could get

13:17.561 --> 13:19.544
the device's I.D. number,
you could program it

13:19.546 --> 13:21.279
to do whatever
you wanted it to do,

13:21.281 --> 13:23.214
including delivering
an electric shock

13:23.216 --> 13:25.934
large enough to induce
a fatal heart attack.

13:25.936 --> 13:28.052
So subtle it wouldn't
even seem like a murder.

13:28.054 --> 13:29.503
You think Moran
was right?

13:29.505 --> 13:31.072
I no longer believe we're trying

13:31.074 --> 13:33.157
to find out <i>if</i>
Phillip Van Der Hoff was killed;

13:33.159 --> 13:35.460
I think we're trying
to learn who <i>did</i> it.

13:35.462 --> 13:36.961
(lively music playing)

13:36.963 --> 13:38.780
What's with the
big band music?

13:38.782 --> 13:40.982
I was thinking about
bootleg alcohol this morning.

13:40.984 --> 13:43.318
Reminded me I haven't listened
to Bix Beiderbecke

13:43.320 --> 13:44.619
in quite some time.

13:44.621 --> 13:47.655
And the doll
being burned at the stake?

13:47.657 --> 13:50.074
I'm in a dispute
with a theologist about Galileo.

13:50.076 --> 13:51.793
How much do you know
about Prohibition?

13:51.795 --> 13:53.027
The normal amount.

13:53.029 --> 13:54.662
Just the broad strokes, then.

13:54.664 --> 13:57.665
America, in a fit of Puritanism,
banned alcohol...

13:57.667 --> 13:59.567
for more than a decade.

13:59.569 --> 14:01.869
But the human urge to pursue
altered states persisted,

14:01.871 --> 14:03.671
resulting in widespread
flouting of the law

14:03.673 --> 14:06.707
in underground saloons
called "speakeasies."

14:06.709 --> 14:09.811
Did we quit the Van Der Hoff
case while I was asleep?

14:09.813 --> 14:11.512
In addition to heading up
his charitable foundation,

14:11.514 --> 14:13.181
Phillip Van Der Hoff
is also a member

14:13.183 --> 14:16.050
of New York City's
Landmark Protection Council,

14:16.052 --> 14:17.718
11 souls whose
responsibility it is

14:17.720 --> 14:19.354
to determine
the landmark status

14:19.356 --> 14:21.823
of historical buildings
in the city.

14:21.825 --> 14:23.858
You think that had something
to do with him being killed?

14:23.860 --> 14:27.078
The council was reviewing the
landmark status of the Taggart

14:27.080 --> 14:29.030
Speakeasy Museum.
It's an old grocer's

14:29.032 --> 14:31.749
on Chamber Street
with a speakeasy in the back,

14:31.751 --> 14:34.735
preserved exactly as it was
in the 1920s-- lovely.

14:34.737 --> 14:36.404
The site's owners--

14:36.406 --> 14:37.839
some shell corporation--

14:37.841 --> 14:39.874
have applied to have
the landmark status removed.

14:39.876 --> 14:42.343
This would free them up
to redevelop the site

14:42.345 --> 14:45.346
for more modern, and presumably,
more profitable purposes.

14:45.348 --> 14:46.798
The owners have applied
three times

14:46.800 --> 14:49.884
to have the status changed
over recent years.

14:49.886 --> 14:52.804
Each time, more council members
change their votes,

14:52.806 --> 14:55.473
inching them closer and closer
to the majority needed

14:55.475 --> 14:57.475
to have landmark status revoked.

14:57.477 --> 15:00.612
Now, a quick check
of city records reveals

15:00.614 --> 15:01.896
that each council member

15:01.898 --> 15:03.781
who has changed his or her vote
also applied

15:03.783 --> 15:07.235
for a home remodeling permit
shortly thereafter,

15:07.237 --> 15:12.073
and in each case,
the renovation was handled by...

15:12.075 --> 15:13.791
Robert Baumann.

15:13.793 --> 15:16.544
Yeah, I've seen his picture
in the papers.

15:16.546 --> 15:17.945
How does he get his teeth

15:17.947 --> 15:19.547
so white?

15:19.549 --> 15:21.633
You know him
because he builds skyscrapers

15:21.635 --> 15:23.334
and yet here
we have him handling

15:23.336 --> 15:25.336
piddling kitchen redos.

15:25.338 --> 15:26.921
They're bribes, you see?

15:26.923 --> 15:29.424
Change your vote,
get the redo of your choice.

15:29.426 --> 15:31.225
So this is the guy who is trying

15:31.227 --> 15:32.894
to get the landmark
status overturned?

15:32.896 --> 15:35.063
And he's only
one council member short

15:35.065 --> 15:37.231
of a majority,
until, that is, two nights ago.

15:37.233 --> 15:39.017
The last thing
Phillip Van Der Hoff did

15:39.019 --> 15:40.985
before he died
was change his vote

15:40.987 --> 15:42.854
on the Taggart Speakeasy Museum.

15:42.856 --> 15:45.473
So you think that bleach-teeth
killed him?

15:45.475 --> 15:47.992
I would very much like to hear
what he has to say about it.

15:54.033 --> 15:56.200
(horns honking outside)

16:13.635 --> 16:15.669
...because the company's called
Baumann and Associates,

16:15.671 --> 16:17.405
that's why. I'm Baumann.

16:17.407 --> 16:18.639
You're an associate.

16:19.641 --> 16:21.893
No, no, no,
don't you...

16:21.895 --> 16:23.778
How many times do I have
to tell you?

16:23.780 --> 16:24.926
No!

16:24.951 --> 16:26.181
Yeah, look,
I appreciate that it's a

16:26.182 --> 16:28.616
tough position for you,
but there's just no way...

16:28.618 --> 16:30.568
Try saying "excuse me",

16:30.570 --> 16:32.036
dildo.

16:32.038 --> 16:33.321
(crashing)

16:33.323 --> 16:34.522
(screams)

16:43.302 --> 16:44.807
Mr. Baumann's
skull was crushed

16:44.808 --> 16:46.909
by a falling
air conditioning unit.

16:46.911 --> 16:48.511
Yeah, came from
the window

16:48.513 --> 16:50.313
right there.

16:50.315 --> 16:52.131
What are the odds, huh?

16:52.133 --> 16:54.483
What are the odds, indeed.

16:54.485 --> 16:56.769
No, there's no way.

16:56.771 --> 16:58.304
You'd have to have
perfect timing,

16:58.306 --> 17:00.740
an expert grasp
of physics.

17:00.742 --> 17:03.025
It's got to be
a stroke of bad luck.

17:08.248 --> 17:11.500
(crashing)

17:21.528 --> 17:23.262
Hey, tell me

17:23.263 --> 17:25.513
you did not just throw an
air conditioner from the roof.

17:25.516 --> 17:28.184
The math is not quite as hard
as you might imagine.

17:28.185 --> 17:29.969
I'm not talking
about how hard it is.

17:29.971 --> 17:31.888
I am talking about the fact
that you could kill somebody.

17:31.890 --> 17:33.222
I checked the courtyard before
I dropped it,

17:33.224 --> 17:34.891
and I hit the X
I drew on the ground

17:34.893 --> 17:36.642
on the very first attempt,
I might add.

17:36.644 --> 17:38.277
With a bit of practice,

17:38.279 --> 17:39.979
I'm sure a moving target
would not be that difficult.

17:39.981 --> 17:43.149
This case is turning out
to be quite fascinating, Watson.

17:43.151 --> 17:46.986
Bleach-teeth was obviously
not in charge of the scheme

17:46.988 --> 17:49.188
to decertify
the Taggart Museum,

17:49.190 --> 17:50.656
but he was big in real estate.

17:50.658 --> 17:52.575
So he probably facilitated
the introductions

17:52.577 --> 17:54.526
on behalf
of the actual mastermind,

17:54.528 --> 17:57.246
then got an AC unit dropped
on his head for his troubles.

17:57.248 --> 17:58.331
Why?
Well, he obviously

17:58.333 --> 17:59.799
had a cut of whatever money

17:59.801 --> 18:01.000
that they stood to make.

18:01.002 --> 18:02.335
Now that he served his purpose,

18:02.337 --> 18:03.886
somebody no longer
wanted to pay.

18:03.888 --> 18:05.721
Hmm, someone-- whoever was
behind the shell company

18:05.723 --> 18:07.173
that owns the museum.

18:07.175 --> 18:09.141
Untraceable shell corporation,

18:09.143 --> 18:10.709
a scheme to make millions

18:10.711 --> 18:13.346
by revoking the landmark status
of an old building,

18:13.348 --> 18:15.982
and murder by home appliance.

18:15.984 --> 18:18.517
We're obviously pursuing
a lively intellect.

18:18.519 --> 18:20.653
You're back to believing
that Moriarty exists?

18:20.655 --> 18:23.155
Call the man commissioning
these crimes whatever you want.

18:23.157 --> 18:25.691
I'm now more and more convinced
that we're in pursuit

18:25.693 --> 18:26.909
of one of his agents.

18:26.911 --> 18:28.560
He does the same kind of work

18:28.562 --> 18:30.446
that Moran does,
but in a very different way.

18:30.448 --> 18:31.831
This man specializes in murders

18:31.833 --> 18:33.866
that do not appear
to be murders at all.

18:33.868 --> 18:35.451
If Moran was a sledgehammer,

18:35.453 --> 18:38.004
our current quarry
is the scalpel.

18:38.006 --> 18:39.922
And how do we catch
our current quarry?

18:39.924 --> 18:41.407
First, I'm gonna clean up
the air conditioner.

18:41.409 --> 18:43.259
Then it's quite obvious
what we need to do.

18:43.261 --> 18:44.427
We need to plan a murder.

18:44.429 --> 18:46.712
WOMAN:
<i>As New Yorkers,</i>

18:46.714 --> 18:48.130
we have to be vigilant

18:48.132 --> 18:49.382
about preserving the landmarks

18:49.384 --> 18:51.100
that make our city great.

18:51.102 --> 18:53.269
When we give away pieces
of our history,

18:53.271 --> 18:55.054
we give away who we are.

18:55.056 --> 18:57.974
HOLMES: Meet Hillary Taggart,
an attorney,

18:57.976 --> 19:01.811
and the last living relative
of Al "The Prawn" Taggart,

19:01.813 --> 19:03.762
owner of the grocery store

19:03.764 --> 19:06.148
which housed his
eponymous speakeasy.

19:06.150 --> 19:08.600
She's an advocate for
preserving the Taggart Museum

19:08.602 --> 19:10.536
exactly as it is.

19:10.538 --> 19:12.938
The only advocate for it,
as far as I can tell.

19:12.940 --> 19:14.740
Well, it's good
to have a hobby.

19:14.742 --> 19:17.209
Even if that hobby puts you
in danger of being killed.

19:17.211 --> 19:19.245
This footage is taken
from the last time

19:19.247 --> 19:21.430
the museum status came up
for review.

19:21.432 --> 19:24.083
Each time it does, Ms. Taggart
does a very good job

19:24.085 --> 19:26.802
of making a nuisance of herself
on the building's behalf.

19:26.804 --> 19:29.055
She threatens lawsuits,
she sends out press releases.

19:29.057 --> 19:31.924
One can only imagine
how she will react

19:31.926 --> 19:34.927
when word of the council's
latest vote gets out.

19:34.929 --> 19:36.746
She'll probably kick up
a very public stink.

19:36.748 --> 19:38.397
She's the next target.

19:38.399 --> 19:40.966
If I was a sociopath, and
I wanted to stop anyone

19:40.968 --> 19:44.520
from taking too close a look
at my murderous transaction,

19:44.522 --> 19:46.789
I would remove Ms. Taggart
from the chessboard.

19:46.791 --> 19:48.441
But we need to warn her.

19:48.443 --> 19:50.026
We'll do no such thing.

19:50.028 --> 19:52.411
Our mission is
to study this woman

19:52.413 --> 19:54.697
to observe her
in her natural habitat.

19:54.699 --> 19:56.782
No, the best way to
keep this woman safe

19:56.784 --> 19:59.001
is to find out
how to kill her.

20:00.504 --> 20:02.421
Hillary Taggart
is unmarried.

20:02.423 --> 20:05.124
She's worked half the day
at the legal aid clinic,

20:05.126 --> 20:07.209
and the remainder of her time
has been devoted

20:07.211 --> 20:09.812
to various volunteer efforts.

20:09.814 --> 20:12.882
(buzzing)

20:14.601 --> 20:17.269
You all right?

20:17.271 --> 20:19.688
Yes, sorry,
thought I noticed something odd.

20:19.690 --> 20:22.308
(clears throat)
Anyway, as I was saying,

20:22.310 --> 20:24.343
the rest of her time
seems to be devoted

20:24.345 --> 20:25.677
to running laps at the pace

20:25.679 --> 20:27.530
of third-grader with
a sprained ankle.

20:27.532 --> 20:28.814
One more thing.

20:28.816 --> 20:30.449
Look at her bracelet.

20:30.451 --> 20:32.952
See how you can make out
part of the Rod of Asclepius?

20:32.954 --> 20:34.820
She's wearing
a medical alert.

20:34.822 --> 20:36.322
Huh.

20:36.324 --> 20:39.708
Could be hemophilia,
epilepsy, a nasty allergy.

20:39.710 --> 20:41.077
(buzzing)

20:41.079 --> 20:43.579
Right, brilliant.

20:43.581 --> 20:46.749
A man after my own heart.

20:49.553 --> 20:51.620
Come on if you're coming.

20:51.622 --> 20:55.808
What kind of an allergy requires
a medical alert bracelet?

20:55.810 --> 20:59.061
Uh, anything that could
bring on anaphylactic shock,

20:59.063 --> 21:02.565
certain foods,
medicine, insect bites.

21:02.567 --> 21:04.216
Exactly. A moment ago,

21:04.218 --> 21:06.885
I could have sworn I saw
an Africanized honeybee.

21:06.887 --> 21:08.938
How do you
"Africanize" something?

21:08.940 --> 21:13.008
It's a term to describe a
particularly aggressive species.

21:13.010 --> 21:14.560
It's odd to...

21:14.562 --> 21:15.911
Odd to see them here.

21:15.913 --> 21:18.230
They're not native
to New York.

21:18.232 --> 21:21.900
It's almost as if someone
has placed it here

21:21.902 --> 21:24.236
on a route known
to be frequented

21:24.238 --> 21:25.621
by Hillary Taggart.

21:25.623 --> 21:27.906
So you think he's planning
a murder by bee?

21:27.908 --> 21:32.378
The hive
will be facing southeast

21:32.380 --> 21:34.079
in dappled sunlight

21:34.081 --> 21:37.082
with minimal wind.

21:37.084 --> 21:38.801
(buzzing)
And here they are,

21:38.803 --> 21:40.603
newly formed

21:40.605 --> 21:42.805
and flourishing.

21:42.807 --> 21:44.256
Oh, yes.

21:44.258 --> 21:47.726
And here is the food source.

21:53.116 --> 21:55.234
Someone's feeding them
sugar water

21:55.236 --> 21:57.119
so they multiply even faster.

21:57.121 --> 21:59.205
Well, it's pretty baroque way
to kill someone, isn't it?

21:59.207 --> 22:01.490
I mean, cultivate bees,
feed them, and then

22:01.492 --> 22:04.276
poke the hive with a stick every
time Hillary Taggart runs by?

22:04.278 --> 22:06.045
Well, he might be
planning to swipe her

22:06.047 --> 22:08.280
with lemongrass
oil beforehand,

22:08.282 --> 22:10.282
make sure they're
attracted to her.

22:10.284 --> 22:11.800
It's actually quite
a tidy plan.

22:11.802 --> 22:13.636
You know, she flees,
bees sting--

22:13.638 --> 22:15.004
tragic accident.

22:15.006 --> 22:16.555
If she's that allergic
to bee stings,

22:16.557 --> 22:18.224
then she's gonna have
an EpiPen.

22:18.226 --> 22:20.342
Well, an EpiPen would work
against one or two stings,

22:20.344 --> 22:21.560
but how effective is it gonna be

22:21.562 --> 22:24.647
against an army
of bee assassins?

22:24.649 --> 22:26.482
If the man
we are looking for

22:26.484 --> 22:27.799
is feeding these bees,

22:27.801 --> 22:29.068
he's gonna have to come
here eventually.

22:29.070 --> 22:30.469
Yeah.
Quite soon, I'd imagine,

22:30.471 --> 22:32.304
'cause the sugar water's
getting low.

22:32.306 --> 22:33.606
Ugh, great.

22:33.608 --> 22:36.808
So we get to stake out
a hive of killer bees.

22:38.195 --> 22:39.645
(buzzing)

22:39.647 --> 22:41.480
WATSON: The closest place
open was Polish.

22:41.482 --> 22:43.482
I hope you like <i>pierozkis.</i>

22:43.484 --> 22:45.201
(sighs)

22:45.203 --> 22:47.319
So, yesterday you said that
I was getting ahead of myself.

22:47.321 --> 22:50.289
Well, now we know that
Phillip Van Der Hoff was murdered,

22:50.291 --> 22:52.258
there's been another death,

22:52.260 --> 22:54.093
and we are sitting
here waiting for

22:54.095 --> 22:56.095
someone we think
works for Moriarty.

22:56.097 --> 22:59.265
So I-I want to know
what our plan is

22:59.267 --> 23:00.549
if we catch this man.

23:00.551 --> 23:02.718
I also need to know
that this time,

23:02.720 --> 23:05.688
it will not involve you
skewering someone with a knife.

23:08.108 --> 23:09.608
Obviously, I do not intend

23:09.610 --> 23:11.644
to turn this man
over to the police.

23:11.646 --> 23:14.179
I intend to find out
who murdered Irene.

23:14.181 --> 23:16.332
And once I've found
the person responsible,

23:16.334 --> 23:18.517
I will not be resorting
to the same tactics

23:18.519 --> 23:20.869
I employed against
Sebastian Moran, okay?

23:24.874 --> 23:26.325
Well, you know,

23:26.327 --> 23:28.527
you never regretted it
last time, so I...

23:28.529 --> 23:30.246
again, what is
different now?

23:30.248 --> 23:32.248
Well, quite frankly,
I'm surprised you have to ask.

23:33.967 --> 23:37.369
When I pursued Moran...

23:37.371 --> 23:41.507
my entire life I had made
one meaningful connection.

23:41.509 --> 23:43.008
That was with Irene Adler.

23:43.010 --> 23:44.727
Hmm?

23:44.729 --> 23:46.729
You were preparing
to take on a new client,

23:46.731 --> 23:49.047
I had every reason to believe
that I would be returning

23:49.049 --> 23:51.383
to the solitary methods of old.

23:51.385 --> 23:54.103
Since then, we've entered
into a partnership.

23:54.105 --> 23:56.438
It's an arrangement
which I find very rewarding.

23:56.440 --> 23:57.723
You're an interesting project,

23:57.725 --> 24:00.726
and I-I enjoy
watching your progress.

24:02.746 --> 24:04.396
The thing that's
different about me,

24:04.398 --> 24:06.198
empirically speaking...

24:06.200 --> 24:07.583
is you.

24:14.457 --> 24:15.874
That is one of
the nicest things

24:15.876 --> 24:17.409
anyone has ever
said to me.

24:22.415 --> 24:26.585
As I said,
it's an empirical observation.

24:26.587 --> 24:30.222
I'd like to promise you that...

24:30.224 --> 24:32.107
when I find the people
responsible for her death,

24:32.109 --> 24:33.275
I won't hurt them.

24:33.277 --> 24:34.810
Just as I'd like
to promise you

24:34.812 --> 24:36.729
that if I found a syringe
of heroin tomorrow,

24:36.731 --> 24:38.397
I won't shoot it into my arm.

24:39.399 --> 24:41.767
Can't know that, though, can I?

24:46.740 --> 24:49.158
In the meantime, you'll just
have to trust my intent.

24:52.212 --> 24:54.380
Better decide quickly, though.

24:54.382 --> 24:56.048
Beekeeper approaches.

24:56.050 --> 24:57.583
He's refilling the water.

24:57.585 --> 24:59.301
What-what do we do?

24:59.303 --> 25:01.637
Well, I said
I wouldn't torture him.

25:01.639 --> 25:04.122
Doesn't mean I'm going to
end this with lively debate.

25:09.062 --> 25:11.013
Excuse me.
We're with the NYPD.

25:11.015 --> 25:12.981
We need to take a look
at your notebook.

25:12.983 --> 25:15.801
These are interesting
calculations.

25:15.803 --> 25:17.403
They appear to track
the trajectory

25:17.405 --> 25:18.771
of a falling
air conditioning unit.

25:18.773 --> 25:20.522
What's your problem, anyway?

25:20.524 --> 25:22.358
You can't arrest me
for doing physics.

25:22.360 --> 25:23.609
Give it to me!

25:23.611 --> 25:25.477
Oh, we're not going
to arrest you.

25:26.863 --> 25:28.697
You're going to help us
find your employer.

25:28.699 --> 25:30.666
(electricity crackles,
man cries out)

25:38.263 --> 25:40.430
Good evening.

25:40.432 --> 25:42.116
Welcome to our home.

25:46.871 --> 25:49.289
We know your name is
Daniel Gottlieb,

25:49.291 --> 25:50.958
that you retired
from your career

25:50.960 --> 25:55.162
as an engineer
several years ago,

25:55.164 --> 25:58.499
and that you've carried out
a number of murders

25:58.501 --> 26:02.436
on behalf of
a mysterious employer.

26:02.438 --> 26:05.072
Let's call him...

26:05.074 --> 26:06.390
Moriarty.

26:06.392 --> 26:09.009
WATSON:
We found information in here

26:09.011 --> 26:10.894
that ties you to the deaths of
Phillip Van Der Hoff

26:10.896 --> 26:12.412
and Robert Baumann.

26:14.099 --> 26:16.233
We can make your career
as a murderer

26:16.235 --> 26:17.734
a matter of record.

26:17.736 --> 26:20.154
You've received a number of
encrypted texts,

26:20.156 --> 26:22.639
similar to those
which we found on the phone

26:22.641 --> 26:24.741
of a serial killer

26:24.743 --> 26:26.994
named Sebastian Moran.

26:26.996 --> 26:29.113
So, a bargain:

26:29.115 --> 26:30.864
I'm going to go
in the other room.

26:30.866 --> 26:32.616
I'm going to send
a text message

26:32.618 --> 26:33.984
from your phone,

26:33.986 --> 26:35.652
saying something's gone wrong.

26:35.654 --> 26:37.337
I will demand

26:37.339 --> 26:39.239
a face-to-face meeting
with your employer.

26:39.241 --> 26:42.075
If, by the time
I receive a response,

26:42.077 --> 26:44.812
you've told me everything
that you know about Moriarty,

26:44.814 --> 26:47.848
I will impose on
my friends at the NYPD

26:47.850 --> 26:49.249
to get you special treatment
in prison.

26:49.251 --> 26:50.884
WATSON:
If you don't say anything,

26:50.886 --> 26:52.836
we're just gonna hand you over
to the police.

26:56.141 --> 26:59.226
Ring that when you decide
what you want to do.

27:07.285 --> 27:09.286
(sighs)

27:09.288 --> 27:10.821
Aren't you even
a little nervous?

27:10.823 --> 27:12.706
I mean, somebody
is sending those texts--

27:12.708 --> 27:14.992
call him Moriarty,
call him whatever you want.

27:14.994 --> 27:17.127
He's behind God knows
how many murders,

27:17.129 --> 27:19.379
and he's about to give you
his undivided attention.

27:19.381 --> 27:20.797
Do you want some tea?

27:20.799 --> 27:22.249
No, I want a drink.

27:23.668 --> 27:25.135
Sorry.

27:25.137 --> 27:26.720
(service bell dings)

27:27.989 --> 27:29.706
(dings)

27:42.053 --> 27:45.405
You're going to be disappointed.

27:45.407 --> 27:47.157
I don't know who he is.

27:47.159 --> 27:50.444
I don't really
know anything about him.

27:50.446 --> 27:52.079
How many people
have you killed?

27:52.081 --> 27:54.364
Thirty-one.

27:54.366 --> 27:56.200
He's been...

27:56.202 --> 27:58.769
active in New York
these past few years.

27:58.771 --> 28:03.907
Sebastian Moran was a notorious
hard man in Shoreditch.

28:03.909 --> 28:06.343
It's easy to see how he came
to Moriarty's attention.

28:06.345 --> 28:08.462
You worked a desk job.

28:08.464 --> 28:10.380
How were you recruited?

28:10.382 --> 28:12.933
Eight years ago...

28:12.935 --> 28:15.969
we were doing
an environmental impact study

28:15.971 --> 28:18.222
for a company based in the UK.

28:18.224 --> 28:21.024
I was working late one night.

28:21.026 --> 28:23.994
This tall guy sits down
next to me.

28:23.996 --> 28:26.146
He doesn't give a me...

28:26.148 --> 28:29.099
just says he's our client.

28:29.101 --> 28:32.536
He was British. Striking.

28:32.538 --> 28:35.739
He said he wanted
to take me to dinner

28:35.741 --> 28:39.543
to discuss the fact
that I'm a serial killer.

28:39.545 --> 28:41.628
He found you out.

28:41.630 --> 28:43.280
How?

28:43.282 --> 28:46.833
He claimed to be experienced
at picking out psychopaths

28:46.835 --> 28:48.252
who were trying to "pass."

28:48.254 --> 28:50.804
He said he'd be in touch.

28:50.806 --> 28:52.789
I never saw him again.

28:52.791 --> 28:55.309
It was all on the phone,
after that.

28:55.311 --> 28:57.678
What else did he say to you
that night?

28:57.680 --> 29:00.097
What, about himself?

29:00.099 --> 29:01.598
Mm... you know...

29:01.600 --> 29:04.985
He mentioned he spent time
in a reform school

29:04.987 --> 29:07.137
when he was a kid.

29:07.139 --> 29:08.939
One more thing:

29:08.941 --> 29:11.325
I know you.

29:11.327 --> 29:13.243
Your face.

29:13.245 --> 29:16.330
I was doing some work for him
in London a few years ago.

29:16.332 --> 29:19.533
I got a text with your picture.

29:19.535 --> 29:22.919
You were dabbling in drugs.

29:22.921 --> 29:26.623
I had an accidental overdose
lined up for you.

29:26.625 --> 29:29.509
Dissolute man-child
gives himself a hot shot.

29:29.511 --> 29:30.994
Who'd look twice?

29:32.180 --> 29:36.466
But I got another message:
"job cancelled."

29:36.468 --> 29:39.386
That was the only time
that ever happened.

29:40.855 --> 29:42.339
(phone blips)

29:46.944 --> 29:48.929
They have agreed
to a meeting.

29:48.931 --> 29:52.899
At the Parthenon.

29:57.405 --> 30:00.123
WATSON:
The man Gottlieb described...

30:00.125 --> 30:02.576
he picked out a serial killer
on a hunch.

30:02.578 --> 30:04.461
He'd have to be observant
to do that; brilliant.

30:04.463 --> 30:07.364
You think Gottlieb
met Moriarty?

30:07.366 --> 30:09.532
I don't know.

30:09.534 --> 30:11.034
But I can't help but wonder

30:11.036 --> 30:13.170
if we've had our first
description of the man.

30:13.172 --> 30:15.538
I wouldn't expect him
to show up here,

30:15.540 --> 30:17.374
if he's even
in the country.

30:17.376 --> 30:18.725
But Gottlieb is already late,

30:18.727 --> 30:20.710
and someone in there
is waiting for him.

30:20.712 --> 30:23.096
WATSON: The guy with the turban
doesn't have any food.

30:23.098 --> 30:25.232
His wife is pregnant
and using the restroom.

30:25.234 --> 30:28.402
He's just indulging her
late-night cravings.

30:29.904 --> 30:33.323
Look at the booth
to the right of them.

30:33.325 --> 30:36.026
He's doing his best
to appear strung out.

30:36.028 --> 30:37.444
He's had a manicure
quite recently,

30:37.446 --> 30:38.779
and he just checked the time

30:38.781 --> 30:42.732
on his limited edition
U-boat watch.

30:42.734 --> 30:46.753
Yeah, he'd have to tell someone
that Gottlieb didn't show.

30:52.576 --> 30:54.544
(engine starts, revs)

30:56.414 --> 30:58.081
Try not to follow
too closely.

30:58.083 --> 31:00.750
Don't lose him altogether,
though.

31:02.220 --> 31:05.105
(engine growling, revving)

31:13.514 --> 31:16.450
WATSON: Looks like he just
got stood up.

31:18.870 --> 31:21.455
(engine revs)

31:24.325 --> 31:25.575
WATSON:
What's he doing?

31:25.577 --> 31:27.444
(bells clanging,
train horn blows)

31:27.446 --> 31:30.080
He's waiting to see if anyone's
trying to follow him.

31:30.082 --> 31:32.332
(train horn blowing)

31:32.334 --> 31:34.668
The meeting's on
the other side of the tracks.

31:42.626 --> 31:44.394
(shutter clicking rapidly)

31:44.396 --> 31:47.481
They'll be long gone
by the time the train passes.

31:49.467 --> 31:51.184
Can you see anything?

31:51.186 --> 31:52.652
(shutter clicking)
I don't know.

31:52.654 --> 31:54.488
Hope so.

32:02.947 --> 32:05.332
Modern cameras can capture
imagery faster

32:05.334 --> 32:08.118
than the human eye
can process it,

32:08.120 --> 32:12.339
so I set the shutter speed to
1/640 of a second,

32:12.341 --> 32:13.673
opened the aperture wide...

32:13.675 --> 32:14.958
WATSON:
You took a picture

32:14.960 --> 32:16.126
between the cars
of a moving train.

32:16.128 --> 32:17.427
I took a series of photos

32:17.429 --> 32:18.661
between the cars
of a moving train.

32:18.663 --> 32:19.996
I also moved the camera

32:19.998 --> 32:22.165
from left to right
to get different angles.

32:22.167 --> 32:23.350
Now, no one photograph

32:23.352 --> 32:24.935
is any good on its own,
of course,

32:24.937 --> 32:27.854
but look at them...

32:27.856 --> 32:30.223
as a whole...

32:36.364 --> 32:37.898
GOTTLIEB:
That's him.

32:37.900 --> 32:40.867
That's the man
who took me to dinner.

33:03.233 --> 33:04.450
(gasps)

33:04.452 --> 33:05.701
What time is it?

33:05.703 --> 33:07.136
Middle of the workday
in England.

33:07.138 --> 33:08.403
(exhales)

33:08.405 --> 33:10.906
So, the man at the train tracks.

33:10.908 --> 33:12.407
We thought he may be British,

33:12.409 --> 33:14.877
we thought he may have spent
time at a reform school.

33:14.879 --> 33:17.713
There are only so many reform
schools in England,

33:17.715 --> 33:21.250
and only so many prisoners
in each of them.

33:21.252 --> 33:22.584
Aren't these
records sealed?

33:22.586 --> 33:24.169
Oh, yeah.

33:24.171 --> 33:26.772
They don't want just
anyone looking at 'em.

33:26.774 --> 33:29.108
I still have contacts
in Britain.

33:32.329 --> 33:33.863
WATSON:
That's him.

33:33.865 --> 33:35.264
"John Douglas."

33:35.266 --> 33:37.616
He was brilliant,
even as a boy.

33:37.618 --> 33:39.118
Lethal, too.

33:39.120 --> 33:41.120
While at the Bodwin
Reform School for Boys,

33:41.122 --> 33:42.404
his dear friend
and roommate,

33:42.406 --> 33:44.073
Randall Breen,
was beaten to death

33:44.075 --> 33:45.491
by a group of older boys.

33:45.493 --> 33:47.276
Within six months
of his death,

33:47.278 --> 33:49.495
three of his
assailants were dead.

33:49.497 --> 33:51.580
You think it was Douglas?

33:51.582 --> 33:53.382
They couldn't prove it.
But they transferred him

33:53.384 --> 33:55.084
to another reform school,
and the deaths stopped.

33:55.086 --> 33:56.919
Well, maybe he has a record
as an adult

33:56.921 --> 33:59.505
that can help us
track him down, huh?

33:59.507 --> 34:02.074
John Douglas was released
on his 18th birthday.

34:02.076 --> 34:04.810
Since then, not a whisper of him
in the system.

34:04.812 --> 34:07.096
I think it unlikely he's used
his own name

34:07.098 --> 34:09.464
in the last 45 years.

34:09.466 --> 34:14.018
I believe he's assumed
another identity.

34:14.021 --> 34:15.971
Moriarty?

34:15.973 --> 34:17.523
If that's the man
we're looking for,

34:17.525 --> 34:19.108
I doubt it's the only alias
that he uses.

34:19.110 --> 34:20.609
So how do we find him?

34:22.445 --> 34:24.313
I don't know.

34:33.206 --> 34:36.458
"I was closer to the truth
than I let on.

34:36.460 --> 34:39.378
"Off to see what I'd do when
presented with a loaded syringe.

34:39.380 --> 34:41.931
"My apologies for
abandoning you

34:41.933 --> 34:45.217
as our drama
approaches its climax."

34:51.024 --> 34:53.842
Good morning,
John Douglas.

34:56.228 --> 34:57.780
Holmes!

34:57.782 --> 35:00.699
I took the liberty of
disassembling your pistol.

35:03.203 --> 35:06.288
How did you find me?

35:06.290 --> 35:08.157
I have Gottlieb.

35:08.159 --> 35:10.326
I arranged the meeting
last night.

35:10.328 --> 35:11.360
I followed your man.

35:11.362 --> 35:12.778
As for you,
you're registered

35:12.780 --> 35:14.213
in this hotel under
the name

35:14.215 --> 35:16.081
Randall Breen.

35:16.083 --> 35:19.218
Same as your cell mate
in Bodwin.

35:21.137 --> 35:22.871
What's in the bag?

35:22.873 --> 35:26.025
The instruments
of your slow demise.

35:27.260 --> 35:29.445
Do you do business
under the name "Moriarty"?

35:29.447 --> 35:33.432
I'm... not him.

35:34.684 --> 35:37.853
I could never be him.

35:37.855 --> 35:39.238
Yes, by all means,

35:39.240 --> 35:42.157
tell me more about
his unfathomable genius.

35:42.159 --> 35:45.427
I know why
you're looking for him.

35:45.429 --> 35:48.730
You want to know about Irene.

35:50.033 --> 35:52.334
I didn't kill her.

35:52.336 --> 35:55.904
But I know
what happened.

35:55.906 --> 35:59.641
I could tell you why
she had to die.

35:59.643 --> 36:02.378
It was because of you, Holmes.

36:04.747 --> 36:08.384
(wind whistling)

36:12.472 --> 36:15.057
(indistinct radio communication)

36:15.059 --> 36:17.810
I just talked to the detective
who caught the case.

36:17.812 --> 36:19.278
She says you were
in the room

36:19.280 --> 36:21.096
when this guy Douglas
got taken out,

36:21.098 --> 36:25.534
but you have no idea
why it happened.

36:25.536 --> 36:26.935
Right.

36:26.937 --> 36:28.404
It would appear
someone didn't want us

36:28.406 --> 36:30.656
to finish the conversation
we were having.

36:30.658 --> 36:33.125
What the hell is going
on with you?

36:33.127 --> 36:36.879
What did Moran say
to you the other day?

36:36.881 --> 36:39.465
There's someone else
involved;

36:39.467 --> 36:42.384
someone who texted
those pictures to Moran.

36:42.386 --> 36:44.386
He had a similar arrangement
with the man

36:44.388 --> 36:45.954
I'm about
to hand off to you.

36:45.956 --> 36:47.673
I've committed myself
to finding this person.

36:47.675 --> 36:48.724
I give you my word:

36:48.726 --> 36:49.975
I will not repeat
the tactics

36:49.977 --> 36:51.894
that put you and I
at odds back then.

36:51.896 --> 36:54.730
I wish your word meant
something more to me.

36:54.732 --> 36:56.482
I know.
Thank you.

36:56.484 --> 36:59.101
Which is why I have
a character witness.

36:59.103 --> 37:00.319
Are you all right?

37:00.321 --> 37:02.321
I'm quite fine.
Watson, I was just

37:02.323 --> 37:05.274
telling Captain Gregson
that I'm a changed man.

37:05.276 --> 37:07.476
That he needn't worry
that I'll hold myself apart

37:07.478 --> 37:09.278
from the norms
of decent behavior.

37:09.280 --> 37:11.029
That's my old medical bag.

37:14.250 --> 37:15.868
Legos?

37:15.870 --> 37:17.652
Yean, the bag needed
a certain heft

37:17.654 --> 37:21.039
if it was gonna fool
John Douglas.

37:21.041 --> 37:24.126
I just bred an antibiotic-
resistant strain of rubella.

37:24.128 --> 37:28.180
This guy has given us
18 murders so far.

37:28.182 --> 37:30.466
He has no interest
in an attorney.

37:30.468 --> 37:32.267
He just wants to talk.

37:32.269 --> 37:33.635
He's had to keep
his "project""

37:33.637 --> 37:35.537
to himself
all these years.

37:35.539 --> 37:37.356
Probably relieved to
finally have an audience.

37:37.358 --> 37:39.525
(phone blips)

37:39.527 --> 37:42.394
Gottlieb's getting
a text.

37:42.396 --> 37:43.729
WATSON:
What does it say?

37:49.903 --> 37:51.820
What's he saying to you?

37:53.189 --> 37:55.090
I-I don't know.

37:55.092 --> 37:56.458
I-I can't read it.
Tell me!

37:56.460 --> 37:59.044
That's not the code we used.

37:59.046 --> 38:00.462
If you want to read
that message,

38:00.464 --> 38:03.332
you're going to have
to translate it yourself.

38:04.867 --> 38:06.051
(lock buzzes)

38:12.976 --> 38:16.061
Do you need something
from me, partner?

38:21.234 --> 38:24.686
Your colleague's in custody.

38:24.688 --> 38:27.722
A man named John Douglas
is in the morgue.

38:27.724 --> 38:29.057
Do you know him?

38:29.059 --> 38:30.492
You know, me and you

38:30.494 --> 38:32.694
can take this all
the way to the top.

38:32.696 --> 38:36.498
What's it take
to crease that mug?

38:36.500 --> 38:40.235
I gave you a good haul
last time, didn't I?

38:41.571 --> 38:43.405
Tell me what this says.

38:43.407 --> 38:47.209
What, the great Sherlock Holmes
couldn't crack it?

38:47.211 --> 38:48.844
I'm working on it.

38:48.846 --> 38:51.013
If you could speed
things up for me,

38:51.015 --> 38:52.747
then I won't have to.

38:56.085 --> 38:59.454
Go to the incoming text log.

39:08.097 --> 39:10.098
Now back to the message.

39:20.710 --> 39:22.911
What does it say?

39:24.714 --> 39:26.615
I don't know.

39:26.617 --> 39:28.950
It's not the code
we used to use.

39:28.952 --> 39:30.302
Bollocks. You're lying.

39:30.304 --> 39:31.637
Nope.

39:31.639 --> 39:33.555
Someone's winding you up, mate.

39:33.557 --> 39:34.806
Tell me what it says, Moran.

39:34.808 --> 39:36.091
I'm done here!

39:36.093 --> 39:37.175
Tell me what it says.

39:38.228 --> 39:40.962
Tell me what it says.
Leave it.

39:41.797 --> 39:43.515
(chains rattling)

39:56.162 --> 39:59.147
(sighs) You didn't get
much sleep last night.

39:59.149 --> 40:02.117
No. I've almost cracked this.

40:02.119 --> 40:04.503
I've identified
the type of cipher.

40:04.505 --> 40:06.705
All that remains
is for me to ascertain

40:06.707 --> 40:08.874
the three-digit sequence
that will decode it.

40:08.876 --> 40:10.842
Well, it is 10:17 right now.

40:10.844 --> 40:13.378
Let's say by 11:00
you haven't cracked it,

40:13.380 --> 40:14.996
we both get some rest, okay?

40:14.998 --> 40:16.782
The code'll be there
in the morning.

40:16.784 --> 40:19.000
10:17. Thank you.

40:19.002 --> 40:20.686
Watson, you know...

40:20.688 --> 40:22.354
some people--
without possessing genius--

40:22.356 --> 40:24.523
have a remarkable knack
for stimulating it.

40:24.525 --> 40:26.525
Oh, an insult <i>and</i> a boast.

40:26.527 --> 40:29.227
10:17.
Moran looked at the time;

40:29.229 --> 40:32.698
he needed to see
when the message was sent.

40:32.700 --> 40:35.417
4:32.

40:35.419 --> 40:37.736
That's when
this message was sent

40:37.738 --> 40:39.371
and that is the decryption key.

40:39.373 --> 40:41.707

Captain, Sebastian Moran

41:43.804 --> 41:45.137
is going to attempt suicide.

41:45.139 --> 41:48.106
You need to call the warden
at Newgate.

41:48.108 --> 41:49.941
I just got off the phone
with him.

41:49.943 --> 41:52.944
Moran slammed his head against
the wall at least a dozen times.

41:52.946 --> 41:54.146
Is he alive?

41:54.148 --> 41:57.366
Well, he was as of five minutes
ago, but, uh...

I don't know

It seems like
maybe you're the game.

42:30.600 --> 42:33.185
That's Gottlieb's phone.
