Juliet, what are you doing here?

13:48.027 --> 13:50.587
I'm running away.
And you're coming with me.

13:50.696 --> 13:51.822
I'd love to!

13:51.931 --> 13:54.764
But I'm supposed to attend
the model UN this weekend.

13:54.867 --> 13:58.064
I'm the delegate from Azerbaijan,
and I'm threatening a rice tariff.

13:58.170 --> 14:01.196
Lisa, I know how important
the model UN's work is.

14:01.307 --> 14:05.175
But Equalia needs you. I need you.

14:07.947 --> 14:09.881

It really went downhill fast.

anyplace can be Equalia.

15:13.145 --> 15:15.613
Oh, no. Clam-Elot's is closed.

15:16.181 --> 15:18.979
I'm not surprised.
Their clam chowder smelled like soap.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.073
Yeah.

15:21.654 --> 15:25.556
I wonder if Lisa has threatened
the model UN with her rice tariff yet?

15:25.658 --> 15:29.059
I doubt it. Friday's usually
just committee assignments

To the extent you can trust
the word of a Belgian, yes!

15:50.516 --> 15:53.542
Lisa ran away! And it's all my fault!

15:53.919 --> 15:57.320
If I'd just let her continue
her obsessive relationship

15:57.423 --> 16:01.325
with that troubled little girl,
everything would've been fine.

16:01.427 --> 16:03.918
If I know my sister, and unfortunately I do,

You probably would.
