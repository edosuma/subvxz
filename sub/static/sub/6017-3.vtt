00:03.969 --> 00:07.599
I stay up late. I'm "night guy."
Night guy wants to stay up late.

00:07.774 --> 00:11.369
"Getting up after five hours' sleep?"
"That's morning guy's problem.

00:11.544 --> 00:14.104
That's not my problem.
I'm night guy.

00:14.280 --> 00:15.611
I stay up as late as I want."

00:15.782 --> 00:18.717
So you get up in the morning,
you're exhausted, groggy.

00:18.885 --> 00:20.785
"Oh, I hate that night guy!"

00:21.855 --> 00:24.517
See, night guy always screws
morning guy.

00:24.691 --> 00:26.852
There's nothing morning guy can do.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.291
The only thing morning guy can do
is oversleep...

00:29.462 --> 00:33.796
...so that day guy loses his job
and night guy has no money to go out.

00:40.273 --> 00:42.207
Do you ever spit
on anybody from here?

00:42.375 --> 00:43.865
No. You?

00:44.044 --> 00:45.841
No.

00:46.513 --> 00:48.447
-Do you ever think about it?
-Yeah.

00:48.615 --> 00:50.310
Me too.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.149
-Hey.
-Hey.

00:55.088 --> 00:57.420
-Well, I got it.
-You got me the air conditioner?

00:57.590 --> 00:59.148
-What do you think?
-Beautiful.

00:59.325 --> 01:00.485
What air conditioner?

01:00.660 --> 01:03.891
My buddy works in an appliance
store. He got us 30 percent off.

01:04.063 --> 01:07.431
-Is it a good one?
-Good one? It's a Commando 8.

01:07.600 --> 01:10.398
-Commando 8?
-Twelve thousand BTUs.

01:10.570 --> 01:13.471
You hate air conditioning.
You've never had an air conditioner.

01:13.640 --> 01:18.100
-But Amy likes air conditioning.
-Oh, an air conditioner for Amy.

01:18.278 --> 01:23.580
Amy doesn't like the temperature
up here. She's a little hot.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.446
-All right.
-Okay. So...

01:26.619 --> 01:28.746
-I'm gonna measure the window up.
-Yeah.

01:31.958 --> 01:34.518
Yeah. Rock on!

01:36.596 --> 01:38.826
I gotta get out of this city.

01:39.365 --> 01:41.925
So you're tunneling
to the center of the Earth?

01:44.537 --> 01:45.765
I'm at the health club.

01:45.939 --> 01:49.375
And while I'm in the pool,
some guy walks off with my glasses.

01:49.542 --> 01:53.000
Who steals prescription glasses?

01:55.181 --> 01:59.083
-You don't have an old pair?
-I broke them playing basketball.

01:59.252 --> 02:01.846
He was running from a bee.

02:04.090 --> 02:06.820
Now if I wanna see anything,
I gotta wear these.

02:07.293 --> 02:10.023
George, those are prescription
goggles?

02:10.729 --> 02:12.698
What is there to see
in a health club pool?

02:12.866 --> 02:14.629
There's a lot of change down there.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.996
When I find that guy,
this much I vow:

02:17.170 --> 02:20.571
Those glasses will be returned
to their rightful owner.

02:20.740 --> 02:23.834
We're behind you, Aquaboy.
Godspeed.

02:24.644 --> 02:27.704
What kind of a sick, demented person
wants another person's glasses?

02:27.981 --> 02:30.381
Yeah, especially those frames.

02:31.251 --> 02:34.982
You know what you ought to do?
Go see Dwayne at J&T Optical.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.417
He'll give you 30 percent off.

02:36.589 --> 02:37.817
Yeah. Come on.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.983
Hey, he just got me 30 percent off
on an air conditioner.

02:41.161 --> 02:44.153
-Really?
-Retail is for suckers.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.191
-What do I have to do?
-Just mention my name.

02:48.368 --> 02:50.427
-That's it?
-That's it.

02:56.609 --> 02:58.270
What about these?

02:58.778 --> 03:00.746
They look good.
I liked the other one too.

03:00.914 --> 03:03.178
I've liked about five of them.

03:03.349 --> 03:06.807
Well, it's a tough decision.
I have to wear these every day.

03:06.986 --> 03:09.420
-I'm deciding on a new face.
-Come on, George.

03:09.589 --> 03:11.580
Pick a face and go with it.

03:13.359 --> 03:15.850
Now, those look good.
They're very bold.

03:17.063 --> 03:19.156
Yes, they are bold.

03:20.567 --> 03:22.091
Jerry, what do you think?

03:22.268 --> 03:25.499
These women would be good-looking
if they weren't wearing glasses.

03:27.140 --> 03:28.402
Hi there, little doggy.

03:28.575 --> 03:31.100
-Do you mind if I pet your dog?
-It's okay with me.

03:31.277 --> 03:32.904
Hi, little doggy.

03:33.580 --> 03:35.047
You can't have that dog in here.

03:35.215 --> 03:39.015
-You okay? Did he bite you?
-Can you believe that guy?

03:39.185 --> 03:40.914
I'm okay. It's just a nip.

03:41.087 --> 03:43.055
He just walked away.

03:43.223 --> 03:46.818
And once again I'm standing here
like a little man.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.029
Well, not this time.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.431
You! Dog man!

04:00.240 --> 04:03.539
-My leg looks pretty bad.
-I'll take you to the emergency room.

04:03.710 --> 04:06.508
-Okay.
-Hey. Any luck? Did you catch him?

04:07.447 --> 04:08.880
No. No.

04:09.048 --> 04:11.949
-I'll take Elaine to the hospital.
-Good, good. Do that.

04:12.852 --> 04:15.912
-What's the matter?
-Oh, no. Nothing.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.579
What is it?

04:18.124 --> 04:19.351
I can't tell you.

04:20.059 --> 04:22.527
-Jerry, can we go?
-Yeah, yeah. In a second.

04:22.695 --> 04:24.959
-You can't tell me?
-I can't tell you.

04:25.131 --> 04:26.496
-Don't ask.
-I'm asking.

04:26.699 --> 04:30.226
-Jerry, my leg.
-Yeah, here. Take care of it.

04:31.204 --> 04:32.831
Come on, George. What is it?

04:34.240 --> 04:37.209
I saw Amy making out
with your cousin Jeffrey.

04:38.211 --> 04:40.111
-What?
-They were right outside.

04:40.613 --> 04:43.275
-Amy and Jeffrey?
-Yes.

04:43.916 --> 04:45.884
-Are you sure?
-Yes. Positive.

04:46.052 --> 04:49.044
But you can't see.
There's no lenses in those frames.

04:50.390 --> 04:53.291
I know. I was squinting.

04:53.459 --> 04:57.896
Jerry, you just catch up with me.
You can just follow the trail of blood.

04:58.831 --> 05:01.231
We're gonna have to
talk about this later.

05:02.802 --> 05:04.531
Thank you.

05:05.338 --> 05:07.033
Taxi!

05:10.276 --> 05:12.744
Excuse me.
What do you think of these?

05:13.146 --> 05:16.377
We just got those in.
It's a very exciting new frame.

05:17.650 --> 05:20.084
Yes, it is exciting.

05:20.253 --> 05:21.720
This is gonna be my new face.

05:21.888 --> 05:24.857
-Do you have a prescription?
-Yeah.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.791
Kramer.

05:34.701 --> 05:35.963
What?

05:36.636 --> 05:37.898
Kramer.

05:39.906 --> 05:43.398
-What about him?
-You do know Kramer.

05:44.444 --> 05:48.073
-Yes.
-Well, I'm mentioning his name.

05:50.683 --> 05:52.378
Why?

05:52.652 --> 05:54.677
Because, you know...

05:55.355 --> 05:58.256
No, I don't know. Look,
I'm gonna need a deposit on these.

06:03.529 --> 06:05.690
Oh, come on. Cousin Jeffrey?

06:05.865 --> 06:08.265
-It's not possible.
-Why not? They could've met.

06:08.434 --> 06:10.868
She loves the park.
He works for the Parks Department.

06:13.106 --> 06:14.869
Jerry, that is so ridiculous.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.373
George didn't even have
his glasses on.

06:17.543 --> 06:19.067
But he was squinting.

06:20.446 --> 06:23.176
So what? Squinting doesn't make
that much of a difference.

06:23.349 --> 06:25.579
Are you kidding?
I've seen him squint.

06:25.752 --> 06:29.051
He can squint his way
down to like 20-30 vision.

06:30.256 --> 06:33.157
Once we drove down from the
Catskills and he lost his glasses.

06:33.326 --> 06:37.422
He squinted his way from Wurtsboro
down to the Tappan Zee Bridge.

06:37.597 --> 06:40.088
He was spotting raccoons
on the road.

06:42.902 --> 06:44.870
-Okay.
-Okay?

06:45.037 --> 06:47.062
That's it?
I don't need a shot?

06:47.240 --> 06:49.936
No shot. Dog bite.

06:51.444 --> 06:53.469
No, I know I wasn't shot.

06:53.646 --> 06:55.238
Do I need a shot?

06:55.415 --> 06:57.940
Not shot. Dog bite.

06:58.851 --> 07:00.910
Woof-woof. Not bang-bang.

07:08.127 --> 07:10.595
-Look at this. The cable's out.
-That's okay.

07:10.763 --> 07:14.130
-We don't have to watch TV.
-No, no. No trouble at all.

07:14.300 --> 07:16.860
It's the principle of the thing.

07:18.237 --> 07:21.536
I like them to know that I know
what's going on...

07:21.707 --> 07:26.201
...that they're not getting away
with anything.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.142
I'm on hold.

07:30.483 --> 07:32.007
So, what did you do yesterday?

07:32.485 --> 07:34.749
-Yesterday?
-Yeah.

07:34.921 --> 07:37.219
You remember yesterday.

07:37.390 --> 07:40.518
Beautiful day.
Good day to be out.

07:41.260 --> 07:45.321
-I didn't do anything.
-Well, you must've done something.

07:48.267 --> 07:51.532
-No. Nothing really.
-Didn't go out of the house?

07:52.338 --> 07:57.799
Didn't take a walk
on Columbus Avenue?

07:57.977 --> 08:00.002
-Well, I did go out for a little while.
-Well.

08:00.179 --> 08:03.307
Your day's getting
more interesting already.

08:04.717 --> 08:06.184
Oh, see?

08:06.352 --> 08:10.220
Told me they'd be back in a minute,
and they lied.

08:12.525 --> 08:15.323
-You can't trust anyone.
-No, you can't.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.395
Well, let's cut the bull, sister!

08:18.431 --> 08:21.491
I know about you swapping spit
with somebody on Columbus.

08:21.667 --> 08:24.500
-What are you talking about?
-Look, my friend saw you.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.001
Saw me? With who?

08:26.606 --> 08:27.971
You tell me.

08:29.108 --> 08:30.666
There's nothing to tell.

08:32.378 --> 08:34.208
There isn't?

08:34.380 --> 08:35.938
No.

08:39.051 --> 08:40.985
All right.

08:41.153 --> 08:42.780
Wanna get some pizza?

08:45.791 --> 08:47.782
I had a feeling this was
too good to be true.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.155
-Why?
-There had to be another side to you.

08:50.329 --> 08:53.958
-No, there's no side.
-There is a side, an ugly side.

08:54.133 --> 08:56.294
No, no ugly side.

08:56.903 --> 08:58.871
-Look, I think I'm gonna go.
-Why?

08:59.038 --> 09:03.134
-It's really hot in here.
-So we can still go out on Friday?

09:03.743 --> 09:05.734
Yeah. When are you getting
an air conditioner?

09:05.912 --> 09:10.212
It's coming.
It's a Commando 8, 12,000 BTUs.

09:10.483 --> 09:12.883
It's gonna be like
a meat locker in here.

09:15.254 --> 09:18.348
-I was an idiot for listening to you.
-Hey, I saw what I saw.

09:18.524 --> 09:21.357
Everything was going so well.
She hadn't seen any flaws in me.

09:21.527 --> 09:23.791
-Now she sees a side.
-What side?

09:23.963 --> 09:26.363
-A bad side, an ugly side.
-So what?

09:26.532 --> 09:29.763
I wasn't planning on showing
that side for another six months.

09:30.636 --> 09:33.696
You made me throw off
the whole learning curve.

09:33.873 --> 09:36.569
-Why don't you just ask Jeffrey.
-He'd just deny it.

09:37.376 --> 09:40.607
-There must be some way to find out.
-Amy said nothing happened.

09:40.780 --> 09:43.408
You're taking her word over mine?
I'm your best friend.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.574
But you're blind as a bat.

09:46.319 --> 09:49.686
I was squinting! Remember that
drive from Wurtsboro?

09:50.389 --> 09:53.119
I was spotting those raccoons.

09:54.427 --> 09:57.954
They were mailboxes, you idiot.
I didn't have the heart to tell you.

10:03.803 --> 10:06.033
Hey, look. A dime.

10:12.378 --> 10:14.005
Mercury head.

10:14.180 --> 10:16.910
-You mind?
-No, keep it.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.151
What happened?
You buzzed five minutes ago.

10:25.324 --> 10:27.588
There was a dog in front,
and it spooked me.

10:27.760 --> 10:31.025
-I couldn't come in until he left.
-A little white dog?

10:31.931 --> 10:33.990
-Yeah.
-Snowball?

10:35.868 --> 10:37.665
You're afraid of Snowball?

10:38.037 --> 10:39.664
I'm afraid of dogs now.

10:41.073 --> 10:43.337
He's like a squirrel.

10:44.844 --> 10:46.141
Well, he frightened me.

10:47.880 --> 10:51.145
-Did you get the shot?
-No. He said I didn't need a shot.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.979
You got bit by a strange dog,
and you didn't get a shot?

10:54.153 --> 10:55.711
You think I should have?

10:56.422 --> 10:58.083
Just go back to the optical store...

10:58.257 --> 11:00.521
...and ask Dwayne if he knows
the dog's owner.

11:00.693 --> 11:02.320
Good idea. I'm gonna do that.

11:06.599 --> 11:08.066
The AC's on its way.

11:08.234 --> 11:10.759
Pardon me.
I went to see your friend Dwayne.

11:10.936 --> 11:12.335
There was no discount.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.200
-What?
-That's right. No discount.

11:14.373 --> 11:16.967
-Did you mention my name?
-Yes, I mentioned your name.

11:17.143 --> 11:18.735
-And?
-Bupkis.

11:20.846 --> 11:23.110
I don't believe this.
That guy owes me big time.

11:23.282 --> 11:25.273
I got him off sugar!

11:25.451 --> 11:27.419
I'm gonna go down there
with you right now.

11:27.586 --> 11:29.884
All right, let me just grab an apple.

11:30.056 --> 11:34.322
-Kramer, Elaine's afraid of Snowball.
-Little Snowball?

11:34.493 --> 11:36.324
He runs on batteries.

11:37.863 --> 11:39.262
You know, George...

11:39.432 --> 11:40.922
...that's an onion.

11:48.507 --> 11:50.441
Yes, it is.

11:54.280 --> 11:57.113
He couldn't tell an apple
from an onion...

11:57.283 --> 11:59.649
...and he's your eyewitness.

12:00.252 --> 12:02.880
I saw them making out.
You can believe it.

12:03.055 --> 12:05.819
I don't know what to believe.
Eating onions, spotting dimes.

12:05.991 --> 12:08.391
I don't know what the hell
is going on!

12:10.663 --> 12:14.064
Look, all you gotta do is get Amy
and Jeffrey together somewhere.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.224
-That's it.
-Hey, wait a second.

12:16.402 --> 12:19.803
I'm going over to Jeffrey's tomorrow
to pick up these Paul Simon tickets.

12:19.972 --> 12:23.169
I'm gonna surprise Amy.
All I gotta do is bring her with me.

12:23.342 --> 12:26.573
Then when Jeffrey opens the door,
it's Howdy Doody time.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.180
Right this way, Mr. Doody.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.577
You'll see. I'm right.

12:39.625 --> 12:41.616
-Hey, Dwayney.
-Hello, Kramer.

12:41.794 --> 12:44.627
-What is going on here?
-What are you talking about?

12:44.797 --> 12:47.129
I'm talking about
the 30 percent discount.

12:47.299 --> 12:48.596
Excuse me.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.794
-A man came in here...
-Don't interrupt, they're discounting.

12:51.971 --> 12:53.871
Who said anything
about a discount?

12:54.240 --> 12:57.232
Oh, how quickly we forget.

12:57.409 --> 12:59.309
-You owe me, buddy.
-For what?

13:00.112 --> 13:02.171
-Remember this?
-What are you doing?

13:02.348 --> 13:04.339
You were eating four of those
for breakfast...

13:04.517 --> 13:07.816
...and chasing it with a Ring Ding
and two Butterfingers on the train.

13:07.987 --> 13:09.784
-Sound familiar?
-Put that away.

13:09.955 --> 13:12.014
Remember when I found you
at Dinky Doughnuts?

13:12.191 --> 13:16.389
You were all hopped up
on cinnamon swirls!

13:17.663 --> 13:19.528
They wouldn't serve you anymore.

13:19.698 --> 13:22.258
You wouldn't have teeth
if it wasn't for me taking you...

13:22.434 --> 13:25.562
...to Joe's fruit stand and stuffing
cantaloupe down your throat.

13:25.738 --> 13:29.299
But so much for gratitude.
Yeah! Yeah!

13:29.475 --> 13:31.272
All right! All right!

13:32.745 --> 13:35.441
I'll give him the discount.
Just put that thing away!

13:36.048 --> 13:37.379
But this squares us.

13:38.350 --> 13:40.181
-Could I just have the name..?
-Out!

13:40.352 --> 13:42.252
We'll see you, Dwayne.

13:47.059 --> 13:49.721
I don't know what to tell you, Elton.

13:51.363 --> 13:55.265
Listen to this. This is not good.
Listen to these symptoms for rabies:

13:55.434 --> 13:57.698
Anxiety. Irritability.

13:57.870 --> 13:59.770
I've got those. I'm irritable.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.499
-Who picked these out?
-I did.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.473
They're ladies' glasses.

14:05.644 --> 14:09.239
All you need is a chain so you can
wear them while playing canasta.

14:12.251 --> 14:14.344
Elaine was supposed to help me.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.681
Hey, I got bit by a dog!

14:16.856 --> 14:19.188
I had to go to the hospital!
I was bleeding to death!

14:19.358 --> 14:21.883
I can't solve every problem you have!

14:22.061 --> 14:23.358
Hey, hey.

14:26.565 --> 14:29.090
I'm sorry. Sorry.

14:30.936 --> 14:33.268
Commando 8 has arrived!

14:33.439 --> 14:36.135
-I'll get the window.
-Twelve thousand BTUs...

14:36.308 --> 14:38.936
...of raw cooling power.

14:40.679 --> 14:42.442
Yeah.

14:43.415 --> 14:45.280
Installed.

14:51.857 --> 14:53.791
That's it?
You don't have to screw it in?

14:53.959 --> 14:57.053
No. Just plug it in,
and the Commando 8 does the rest.

14:57.229 --> 14:58.958
-I'll seal it up later.
-Yeah.

14:59.131 --> 15:02.259
-Just in time for Amy.
-When are you gonna execute that?

15:02.434 --> 15:04.959
Oh, God.
I've got such a headache.

15:05.137 --> 15:07.571
Oh, that's another symptom.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.833
-Of what?
-Rabies.

15:10.009 --> 15:11.738
That's fatal. You don't want that.

15:12.444 --> 15:14.241
I know I don't want it.

15:14.413 --> 15:16.540
I don't need you to tell me
what I don't want...

15:16.715 --> 15:18.012
...you stupid hipster doofus!

15:18.183 --> 15:21.277
Hey, hey, what is this?

15:21.453 --> 15:22.784
What's going on here?

15:22.955 --> 15:24.479
I'm sorry, Kramer. I'm sorry.

15:24.657 --> 15:26.181
No, it's all right.

15:26.358 --> 15:28.326
I had a friend who had rabies once.

15:29.995 --> 15:32.156
May I have one of those, madam?

15:40.439 --> 15:42.373
Madam? What are you
calling me madam for?

15:42.541 --> 15:44.702
They're ladies' glasses.

15:45.377 --> 15:46.935
Look, see? It's right here.

15:47.112 --> 15:49.273
"Gloria Vanderbilt Collection."

15:51.283 --> 15:53.683
He sold me ladies' glasses!

15:53.852 --> 15:55.513
I...

15:55.688 --> 15:59.089
I think I'm...
I'm having trouble swallowing.

16:01.860 --> 16:03.794
I... I can't swallow.

16:03.963 --> 16:07.865
She's got rabies,
just like my friend Bob Sacamano.

16:08.167 --> 16:12.536
Look at that, she's delirious.
She's foaming at the mouth!

16:17.443 --> 16:20.173
-Is this gonna hurt?
-Yes, very much.

16:25.517 --> 16:28.145
-What if Jeffrey's not home?
-He'll be home.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.686
Friday night, the big night
on the Nature Channel.

16:30.856 --> 16:32.118
Let me tell you something.

16:32.291 --> 16:34.282
There is no way
cousin Jeffrey's dating Amy.

16:34.460 --> 16:37.054
-He looks like a horse.
-He does look like a horse.

16:37.229 --> 16:40.494
Yeah, he's got a real horse face.

16:42.234 --> 16:43.599
Hey, look at this.

16:43.769 --> 16:45.703
It's the guy with the dog.

16:45.871 --> 16:48.101
Hey! Hey, you, down there!

16:48.273 --> 16:49.501
Remember me?!

16:49.675 --> 16:52.542
I had to get shots
because of your stupid dog!

16:52.711 --> 16:54.474
Who are you calling stupid?

16:54.646 --> 16:57.547
-Hey, should we spit on him?
-No, no. Come on. Let's go down.

17:02.054 --> 17:03.521
The air conditioner!

17:05.000 --> 17:11.074

17:15.467 --> 17:17.332
I think it got the dog!

17:24.343 --> 17:26.140
Oh, boy.

17:26.878 --> 17:29.712
Excuse me. I'm new here.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.316
Would you mind walking me
back to my locker?

17:33.852 --> 17:35.251
Sure, why not.

17:35.854 --> 17:37.446
There you go.

17:39.358 --> 17:41.019
-Hey, that's the guy.
-What guy?

17:41.193 --> 17:42.717
The guy that stole my glasses.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.261
This time I got him!

17:46.465 --> 17:49.662
-Could you pick it up a little?
-Where the hell are we going?

17:49.835 --> 17:51.666
He's getting on a bus. Damn.

17:53.338 --> 17:54.635
Those are nice glasses.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.307
I don't like them.
They pinch my nose.

17:58.644 --> 18:00.612
Is that right?

18:02.848 --> 18:05.282
My friend and I would like
to exchange frames.

18:05.451 --> 18:07.942
Could you put his lenses
in my frames and mine in his?

18:08.320 --> 18:09.844
Yeah, we can do that.

18:10.022 --> 18:12.013
Excuse me one second.

18:12.191 --> 18:13.749
And I'd like a discount.

18:14.493 --> 18:15.858
Why should I?

18:16.028 --> 18:18.360
You're lucky I'm not asking
for a whole refund.

18:18.530 --> 18:20.327
You gave me ladies' frames.

18:20.499 --> 18:22.126
What's that about ladies' frames?

18:24.736 --> 18:28.900
Say, I'm trying to track down that lady
that was in here the other day.

18:29.074 --> 18:31.008
Well, she's trying
to track you down.

18:31.176 --> 18:33.235
Well, I would love to talk with her.

18:33.412 --> 18:36.313
-She lives on 81st Street, right?
-That's Jerry.

18:36.482 --> 18:37.710
Really?

18:37.883 --> 18:40.181
You wouldn't happen to know
what apartment he's in?

18:40.352 --> 18:41.614
Yeah, 5A.

18:42.621 --> 18:43.849
Thanks a lot.

18:46.125 --> 18:49.026
-What are we doing here?
-Oh, you'll find out.

18:49.194 --> 18:51.389
I don't know.
You're acting very mysteriously.

18:51.563 --> 18:54.123
Well, I'm very mysterious by nature.

18:55.100 --> 18:58.399
-A lot of women find that attractive.
-I find it annoying.

19:02.674 --> 19:04.642
Hello!

19:05.544 --> 19:08.741
-Uncle Leo.
-Come on in.

19:09.481 --> 19:11.346
-This is Amy.
-Hello, Amy.

19:11.517 --> 19:14.418
-What are you doing here?
-Jeffrey went out tonight.

19:14.887 --> 19:16.718
Very convenient.

19:17.055 --> 19:19.785
I'm supposed to tape
this nature show for him.

19:19.958 --> 19:22.426
He loves nature, botany, zoology.

19:22.594 --> 19:26.257
You know, his botany teacher from
college stays in close touch with him.

19:26.431 --> 19:28.626
-They became friends.
-Really?

19:28.800 --> 19:30.768
That's pretty rare!

19:30.936 --> 19:32.460
I mean, actual friends!

19:32.638 --> 19:34.401
Like equals.

19:34.573 --> 19:36.632
They have dinner together,
discussions.

19:36.808 --> 19:40.369
Uncle Leo, did he leave
any tickets here for me?

19:40.546 --> 19:41.979
Oh, yeah. I'll get them.

19:42.147 --> 19:43.705
Thank you.

19:43.882 --> 19:47.579
-What tickets?
-The Paul Simon "Concert in the Park."

19:47.753 --> 19:50.984
-We're going to the concert?
-That's right, lady.

19:51.156 --> 19:53.886
-What a great surprise!
-I thought you'd like that.

19:54.693 --> 19:57.321
So that's why you've been acting
so mysteriously.

19:57.496 --> 20:00.863
Now you know.
That and that alone is the reason.

20:01.934 --> 20:04.664
You know Jeffrey's favorite animal?

20:04.836 --> 20:06.895
The leopard.

20:07.739 --> 20:11.800
-Why is that?
-He likes the spots.

20:12.444 --> 20:15.379
-Oh, here's the tickets.
-Thank you.

20:16.014 --> 20:17.914
Oh, he asked me to give you
a message.

20:18.083 --> 20:19.607
He said that...

20:19.785 --> 20:23.619
...he's very sorry,
and he hopes you'll forgive him.

20:25.891 --> 20:28.485
So it's true!
You were making out with him.

20:28.660 --> 20:31.151
What are you talking about?
I don't know Jeffrey.

20:31.663 --> 20:33.631
So this is why
you brought me up here.

20:33.799 --> 20:36.393
Very convincing,
but it's not gonna work this time.

20:36.568 --> 20:38.593
What are you talking about?

20:38.770 --> 20:43.605
All he meant was that he was sorry
that the seats aren't very good.

20:50.816 --> 20:52.807
Wanna get some pizza?

21:01.026 --> 21:06.259
-Boy, these really do pinch the nose.
-Tough luck. A deal's a deal.

21:06.832 --> 21:08.129
Oh, my God. It is them.

21:30.188 --> 21:33.646
I still don't know how you spotted
that dime. I think you planted it.

21:34.259 --> 21:36.557
Plus, I gotta pay that vet bill
for the stupid dog.

21:36.728 --> 21:38.821
I don't know how that guy
got my name.

21:40.666 --> 21:42.327
Yeah.

21:43.935 --> 21:46.335
Boy, these really do pinch.

21:46.505 --> 21:50.464
If I ever find the son of a bitch
that stole my glasses...

22:01.620 --> 22:05.750
When did glasses go from being
this carefully crafted apparatus...

22:05.924 --> 22:07.824
...to just this mall impulse item?

22:07.993 --> 22:11.485
"Honey, I'm going out for yogurt
and trifocals. Need anything?"

22:11.930 --> 22:13.488
"Glasses in a about an hour."

22:13.665 --> 22:18.534
"How much?" "Seventy-five bucks."
"Well, here's 72. It's about 75."

22:18.704 --> 22:21.571
What, you're trying to coordinate
with the one-hour photo place?

22:21.740 --> 22:26.006
"Hurry up! Give me the glasses. My
pictures are coming. I need to see!"

22:26.878 --> 22:29.472
Then they have those
Woolworth glasses.

22:29.648 --> 22:31.878
They're there. They're there now.

22:32.084 --> 22:34.382
No exam. You don't have any idea
what's wrong.

22:34.553 --> 22:37.283
And the glasses are made up.
They're ready and waiting.

22:37.456 --> 22:40.118
"Thank you."
You just walk into a wall.
