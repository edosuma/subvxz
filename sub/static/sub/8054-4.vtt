<i>... And to my wife, I apologize.</i>

00:03.276 --> 00:06.457
<i>All I can say is,
I wasn't just having sex.</i>

00:07.062 --> 00:09.634
<i>I was making love
to a beautiful woman...</i>

00:10.928 --> 00:12.176
<i>and her boyfriend,</i>

00:12.301 --> 00:15.097
<i>and a third person
whose name I never learned.</i>

00:15.526 --> 00:18.076
<i>Furthermore,
it was wrong of me to say</i>

00:18.201 --> 00:20.679
<i>I was building houses
for the underprivileged</i>

00:20.804 --> 00:23.182
<i>when I was actually
having four-way sex</i>

00:23.307 --> 00:25.270
<i>in a cave in Brazil.</i>

00:25.537 --> 00:27.610
I bet cave sex is in-sane.

00:27.779 --> 00:30.246
- Why?
- The echoes and the humidity.

00:31.490 --> 00:34.467
<i>... In my defense,
it was my birthday,</i>

00:35.212 --> 00:37.119
<i>and I really wanted to do it.</i>

00:37.445 --> 00:38.954
I think it's a real shame

00:39.122 --> 00:42.035
when people focus
on the tawdry details of a scandal.

00:42.460 --> 00:46.284
Personally, all I care about
is councilman Dexhart's policies,

00:46.409 --> 00:48.963
not whether he was high
on nitrous and cocaine

00:49.347 --> 00:50.849
during the cave sex...

00:50.974 --> 00:52.802
which, by the way, I heard he was.

00:53.290 --> 00:55.377
<i>... One more shocking revelation
in a story</i>

00:55.502 --> 00:57.223
<i>that just won't stop unfolding.</i>

00:57.392 --> 01:00.518
<i>It turns out councilman Dexhart
may have also had sex</i>

01:00.686 --> 01:02.824
<i>with a prostitute in the limousine</i>

01:02.949 --> 01:06.249
<i>on the way to and from
the press conference</i>

01:06.374 --> 01:08.931
<i>where he apologized
for having an affair.</i>

01:09.641 --> 01:11.774
Why does anybody want to run
for public office?

01:11.899 --> 01:14.532
You're just asking to have
your entire life exposed.

01:14.806 --> 01:17.997
Well, if you're squeaky clean,
like I am, there's no problem.

01:18.537 --> 01:20.537
You're married, and you hit
on women constantly.

01:20.840 --> 01:23.424
Yeah, but I've never
sealed the deal.

01:23.850 --> 01:25.304
Just window shopping.

01:25.568 --> 01:27.772
You can fly to Brazil,
just don't enter the cave.

You think that you're clean,

01:54.031 --> 01:56.101
but I bet that we could find
something on you.

01:56.226 --> 01:58.893
I changed my name, which is legal,
and once in high school,

01:59.018 --> 02:01.328
a girl beat me in a wrestling match.
That's it.

02:01.864 --> 02:04.039
I bet anything I can find
worse stuff on all you.

02:04.209 --> 02:06.109
Are you suggesting a game?

02:06.711 --> 02:08.210
- I'm in.
- I'm in.

02:08.377 --> 02:10.838
- I'm out.
- Not an option, Jerry.

02:11.080 --> 02:13.841
- You're going down.
- Seriously, I don't want to play.

02:14.010 --> 02:16.515
No, seriously, you are playing.
We're gonna nail you.

02:17.284 --> 02:18.470
I will play, too.

02:18.721 --> 02:21.351
If only to prove
that I can find more dirt on you

02:21.476 --> 02:22.767
than you can on me.

02:23.163 --> 02:24.834
That's why we're all playing.

02:25.728 --> 02:27.354
Your desk is over there.

02:27.543 --> 02:29.815
I love games that turn people
against each other.

02:30.300 --> 02:33.547
You will never believe
what I just found on Jerry's Facebook.

02:33.672 --> 02:34.748
A friend.

02:34.873 --> 02:35.895
Burn.

02:36.283 --> 02:38.739
Okay, again,
I'd really rather not play.

02:39.117 --> 02:40.594
Hey, guys, what are you doing?

02:40.719 --> 02:42.538
Trying to see who has
the least dirt on them

02:42.663 --> 02:44.617
in case someone wants
to run for office.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.125
Well, it ain't Jerry,
that's for sure.

02:47.277 --> 02:50.252
He's got a couple of 3-5-9s on him.
Public urination.

02:50.780 --> 02:52.282
I don't like this game.

02:52.407 --> 02:53.857
Just don't like it.

02:56.370 --> 02:58.552
He's probably gonna go
anger pee in the courtyard.

03:01.074 --> 03:02.844
You crazy park people,

03:03.412 --> 03:04.610
I'm out of here.

03:04.965 --> 03:06.537
Leslie, I'll see you tomorrow.

03:06.662 --> 03:10.272
Tomorrow will be
our first official... first date.

03:10.583 --> 03:13.071
- Roger that.
- Copy. Over and out.

03:14.211 --> 03:16.612
Dave and I are going
on our first date tomorrow.

03:17.404 --> 03:19.339
I'm not nervous.
Why should I be nervous?

03:19.464 --> 03:21.715
We're just two people
going on a first date.

03:21.840 --> 03:23.717
There's nothing to be nervous about.

03:30.098 --> 03:31.498
That was my phone.

03:34.293 --> 03:36.230
What are you...
what are you doing here?

03:36.355 --> 03:39.051
Just having lunch with Leslie.
What are you up to?

03:39.355 --> 03:43.183
I'm looking for scandalous information
about my co-workers

03:43.722 --> 03:45.349
for a game that we're playing.

03:46.323 --> 03:48.018
My taxes pay your salary, right?

03:49.980 --> 03:50.883
Cool.

03:55.728 --> 03:57.069
And he looked up at me,

03:57.238 --> 03:59.068
and he said,

03:59.193 --> 04:00.865
"Thank you. You saved my life".

04:02.515 --> 04:05.113
Hey, listen, I'm really nervous
about this date tomorrow night.

04:05.238 --> 04:07.580
Do you have, like, a first date
outfit I could borrow?

04:07.748 --> 04:10.431
Like, I don't know,
pair of cargo pants.

04:10.556 --> 04:12.251
I wouldn't go with a cargo pant.

04:12.431 --> 04:14.059
What about, like, a sexy hat?

04:14.337 --> 04:16.819
- I don't know what that even is.
- Helping already.

04:17.064 --> 04:18.890
Do you want to come by
after work today?

04:19.015 --> 04:20.466
Sure, yeah. Tonight?

04:21.112 --> 04:22.618
Several hours from now?

04:26.460 --> 04:28.642
Or you could just come over now?

04:28.810 --> 04:30.603
I think that would better.
Let's go.

04:35.973 --> 04:37.401
What you doing, guys?

04:37.570 --> 04:39.183
Looking for dirt on me?

04:39.473 --> 04:40.473
No point.

04:40.723 --> 04:41.905
Give up now.

04:42.351 --> 04:44.496
Oh, wait, there is this.

04:45.731 --> 04:46.731
Everybody,

04:47.508 --> 04:49.371
I bought a croissan'wich
this morning.

04:49.860 --> 04:52.419
This isn't even a real receipt,
just a scrap of paper.

04:52.987 --> 04:54.268
Taliban robes!

04:54.522 --> 04:56.864
What? Where'd you get
that photo from?

04:58.864 --> 05:00.611
Nice taliban robes.

05:01.051 --> 05:03.461
Those aren't taliban robes.
That's from Halloween.

05:03.586 --> 05:04.873
I was dressed like a jedi.

05:04.998 --> 05:07.861
I'm sure that the voters
would be able to tell the difference.

05:08.074 --> 05:10.151
Looks to me
like you're in the taliban.

05:10.519 --> 05:13.062
Did everybody know
that Ron's ex-wife Tammy

05:13.231 --> 05:15.688
is actually his second ex-wife
named Tammy?

05:15.946 --> 05:18.923
That's right.
Ron has two ex-wives,

05:19.048 --> 05:21.178
each named Tammy.

05:22.699 --> 05:24.349
Both of them bitches.

05:24.951 --> 05:27.822
Yes, my mom's name is Tammy.

05:30.581 --> 05:31.898
What's your point?

05:32.125 --> 05:34.459
Tom! That was a jaeger-secret.

05:35.336 --> 05:37.325
You just breached a jaeger-secret.

05:38.214 --> 05:40.589
Damn!
This just heated up quick.

05:43.344 --> 05:44.927
- That looks great.
- Yeah?

05:45.095 --> 05:47.538
Will you be wearing it
out of the store today, madame?

05:47.663 --> 05:49.823
I think I will, good lady.

05:52.102 --> 05:54.227
- Can I ask you a question?
- Shoot.

05:54.417 --> 05:55.602
if I've been married?

05:55.773 --> 05:57.105
- Have you?
- No.

05:57.230 --> 06:00.004
- Then say that.
- But he'll wonder why I haven't been.

06:00.129 --> 06:02.049
You know what?
I'm gonna say that I was married,

06:02.174 --> 06:04.177
but the question is,
should I say that I have kids?

06:04.302 --> 06:06.233
Guy like girls
that have kids, right?

06:06.700 --> 06:08.868
What if I get drunk
and I talk about Darfur too much?

06:08.993 --> 06:10.994
Or not enough?

06:11.242 --> 06:12.370
Leslie, relax.

06:15.115 --> 06:18.877
I have a few more questions for you.
"What if he shows up with another woman?

06:19.133 --> 06:21.045
"What if one of my sleeves
catches on fire

06:21.214 --> 06:22.690
"and it spreads rapidly?

06:22.815 --> 06:25.941
"What if, instead of tic tacs,
I accidentally pop a couple of ambien,

06:26.066 --> 06:28.070
and I have to keep punching
my leg to stay awake?"

06:28.195 --> 06:30.074
Those are all insane hypotheticals,

06:30.199 --> 06:32.141
and I promise you they won't happen.

06:33.297 --> 06:34.690
They have happened.

06:35.665 --> 06:37.511
All of these have happened to me.

06:38.129 --> 06:39.271
No, there's more.

06:39.396 --> 06:42.433
One time, I accidentally drank
an entire bottle of vinegar.

06:42.558 --> 06:43.944
I thought it was terrible wine.

06:44.113 --> 06:47.484
Once, I went out with a guy
who wore 3-d glasses the entire evening.

06:47.832 --> 06:50.658
One time, I rode in a sidecar
on a guy's motorcycle,

06:50.783 --> 06:53.487
and the sidecar detached
and went down a flight of stairs.

06:53.955 --> 06:56.740
Another time, I went to a really
boring movie with a guy,

06:56.865 --> 06:59.714
and while I was asleep,
he tried to pull out one of my teeth.

07:00.431 --> 07:02.704
I literally woke up
with his hand in my mouth.

07:03.349 --> 07:05.466
We went out after that,
but then he got weird.

07:05.711 --> 07:07.361
I know it sounds crazy.

07:07.552 --> 07:10.888
I'm a grown woman,
but I'm just not good on first dates.

07:12.722 --> 07:15.324
You have a problem,
and this is how we're gonna fix it.

07:15.449 --> 07:17.358
I know what you're thinking.
I wear an earpiece,

07:17.483 --> 07:20.028
you sit at a table nearby,
you speak into a mike,

07:20.153 --> 07:22.841
you tell me what to say on the date,
but let me tell you, it never works.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.409
We are gonna go to a restaurant
and have a practice date.

07:26.534 --> 07:29.072
I will pretend to be Dave,
and you will practice on me.

07:29.830 --> 07:31.075
That's a way better idea.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.606
Hey, Dave, it's me.
It's Leslie.

07:35.790 --> 07:39.124
Hi, Leslie, it's good to see you.
You don't want to do that quite yet.

07:41.658 --> 07:43.295
Let's begin our conversation.

07:45.613 --> 07:47.463
What's on the note cards?

07:47.588 --> 07:49.411
They're possible topics
of conversation.

07:49.553 --> 07:52.536
Whales, parades, electricity...

07:53.834 --> 07:56.391
- And the rest are blank.
- I couldn't think of anything else.

07:56.744 --> 07:58.746
Leslie's in worse shape
than I thought.

08:03.125 --> 08:04.875
Is she practice laughing?

08:11.242 --> 08:13.570
The Danish call it
<i>oppe og nede apparat,</i>

08:13.695 --> 08:15.660
which literally translated means

08:15.830 --> 08:17.386
"the up and down machine".

08:18.456 --> 08:20.761
That's a thorough history
of the teeter-totter.

08:20.887 --> 08:24.303
Now I'm gonna talk about the local flora
and fauna found in Pawnee.

08:24.454 --> 08:26.782
You know what?
Just ask me a question.

08:26.907 --> 08:28.757
- Just try to get to know me.
- Okay.

08:31.663 --> 08:34.554
I can't think of anything to ask you.
I'm sorry. My mind is blank.

08:34.722 --> 08:36.556
Ask me the first thing
that comes to you.

08:36.725 --> 08:37.924
How big is it?

08:39.886 --> 08:41.577
- Really?
- Oh, my God.

08:44.393 --> 08:45.280
You ready?

08:45.405 --> 08:48.005
Yes, I am.
Just give me one second.

08:48.537 --> 08:50.756
Donna, let me ask you something.

08:51.352 --> 08:52.663
Do you hate black people?

08:52.788 --> 08:53.788
Excuse me?

08:53.913 --> 08:55.826
'Cause apparently in 1988,

08:56.166 --> 08:57.352
you donated money

08:57.477 --> 08:59.605
to the presidential campaign for...

08:59.730 --> 09:00.978
David Duke!

09:01.103 --> 09:02.106
The KKK guy?

09:02.231 --> 09:05.127
I got a phone call.
They said he would lower taxes.

09:06.435 --> 09:07.921
How's it feel to lose so hard?

09:08.921 --> 09:10.883
I'm sorry, honey.
Let's get coffee.

09:11.055 --> 09:13.699
Re-Ron, you remember
my wife, wendy Haverford.

09:13.824 --> 09:15.596
Of course.
How are things at the hospital?

09:15.893 --> 09:17.807
Very good, thank you.

09:17.932 --> 09:20.309
I just got a pediatric
surgery fellowship.

09:20.498 --> 09:21.375
Nice.

09:21.500 --> 09:23.499
We're celebrating,
'cause she's super rich

09:23.688 --> 09:25.448
and super hot also.

09:25.573 --> 09:28.441
- Okay, come on, Tommy. Cut it out.
- You're super hot.

09:28.631 --> 09:31.900
Everybody else has to deal with it.
Let's get out of here. See you later.

09:34.187 --> 09:36.818
I've established
a scientifically perfect

09:36.943 --> 09:39.035
ten-point scale of human beauty.

09:39.205 --> 09:41.079
Wendy is a 7.4,

09:41.204 --> 09:43.459
which is way too high for Tom,

09:43.584 --> 09:45.694
who is a 3.8.

09:46.210 --> 09:48.810
Ten is tennis legend Steffi Graf.

09:53.153 --> 09:56.220
You're late, and I can see your nipples
through your dress.

09:56.388 --> 09:57.930
What? No. Really?

09:58.098 --> 10:01.099
In nursing school, we took
a psych course on how to treat phobias

10:01.224 --> 10:03.604
with a method called
exposure therapy.

10:03.729 --> 10:07.417
So like if you were afraid of snakes,
they'd immerse you in a tank of snakes,

10:07.542 --> 10:11.546
so I am going to immerse Leslie
in a tank of bad date.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.181
You're 20 minutes late.
I almost left.

10:14.739 --> 10:15.957
I was...

10:17.174 --> 10:18.492
dropping my niece off.

10:18.660 --> 10:21.868
- What's your niece's name?
- Torple. What? I don't know.

10:22.757 --> 10:23.872
That's not a name.

10:24.092 --> 10:25.416
I don't have a niece.

10:26.185 --> 10:28.460
- My niece's name is Stephanie?
- Stop lying!

10:28.628 --> 10:30.486
Look, there's bread!
You want some...

10:31.089 --> 10:33.882
I got flowers in your soup.
I'm so sorry...

10:34.192 --> 10:36.792
Just... I have to go to the...

10:37.385 --> 10:39.321
whizz palace.
You know, Dave, the...

10:39.446 --> 10:40.888
the place where you...

10:41.013 --> 10:42.863
you know, the toilet thing.

10:46.734 --> 10:48.034
It's a bathroom!

10:48.159 --> 10:49.648
It's called a bathroom!

10:55.014 --> 10:56.465
A little birdy told me

10:56.590 --> 10:59.516
that you have
one unpaid parking ticket.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.531
That's funny,
because a little birdy told me

11:01.656 --> 11:05.018
that your adoptive mother
was arrested for marijuana possession.

11:05.659 --> 11:06.872
Snap!

11:07.212 --> 11:09.087
- What?
- You didn't know that, huh?

11:11.728 --> 11:13.461
I didn't know I was adopted.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.342
- I'm so sorry.
- I really didn't want to play.

11:23.873 --> 11:25.992
- That was not my intention.
- It's not your fault.

11:26.117 --> 11:28.687
He totally baited you
with that unpaid parking ticket.

11:29.308 --> 11:31.908
Tom, could you come into my office?

11:33.122 --> 11:34.568
Tom-mato sauce.

11:35.188 --> 11:36.468
Ron-tanamo bay.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.196
Do be seated,

11:38.972 --> 11:41.074
and congratulate me.

11:41.792 --> 11:43.702
- For what?
- Winning the game.

11:44.136 --> 11:47.137
I just found out, through some pretty
impressive investigating,

11:47.262 --> 11:49.532
that your wedding was a sham.

11:49.944 --> 11:52.034
- It's a green card marriage.
- That's crazy.

11:52.159 --> 11:54.645
I was born in south Carolina.
These colors don't run, baby.

11:54.770 --> 11:57.147
Yes, but Wendy was born in Ottawa...

11:57.272 --> 11:58.175
Canada!

11:59.019 --> 12:01.901
Her visa was set to expire
the day after you got married

12:02.026 --> 12:06.030
at the county courthouse
in front of 3 strangers and no family.

12:08.365 --> 12:11.271
We met in college.
She wanted to work in the states.

12:11.439 --> 12:12.981
She couldn't get a permit.

12:13.990 --> 12:16.443
I knew it. I knew you couldn't
get a wife as hot as her.

12:16.851 --> 12:19.452
Seriously, Ron, games aside,
you got to keep this between us.

12:19.577 --> 12:22.491
- Don't tell anybody, please.
- Come on. I'm not gonna turn you in.

12:23.044 --> 12:25.672
Just admit that when it comes
to digging up dirt,

12:25.797 --> 12:27.239
I bested you in this game.

12:27.364 --> 12:31.192
- Say it. Say "I bested you."
- Fine, you bested me. Is that all?

12:33.631 --> 12:35.962
- I'll have your wife tonight.
- What?

12:37.238 --> 12:38.490
I'm just kidding.

12:38.615 --> 12:39.673
Get out of here.

12:40.400 --> 12:41.759
Why would you say that?

12:42.000 --> 12:44.471
That dog was like my
best friend, and when she died...

12:46.379 --> 12:47.516
Hey, Tiffany.

12:47.943 --> 12:50.018
Yeah, I definitely
want to see you tonight.

12:51.042 --> 12:53.855
No, I can't really talk right now,
'cause I'm a date with this drip.

12:54.955 --> 12:55.933
I can ask.

12:56.058 --> 12:58.527
Do you want to watch
a porno after this with me and my wife?

12:59.016 --> 13:01.863
No, Dave, 'cause you're disgusting.

13:04.022 --> 13:06.901
- So it's definitely a no?
- Why you're being so terrible?

13:07.245 --> 13:10.340
We're 2 people trying to go on a date.
It's supposed to be fun. It's a date.

13:10.465 --> 13:11.852
You're right, it is.

13:11.977 --> 13:12.958
Well done.

13:13.337 --> 13:14.795
I had to get all medical on you,

13:14.920 --> 13:17.348
but now you see
that even if everything goes wrong,

13:17.473 --> 13:18.629
you'll survive.

13:23.206 --> 13:24.486
You coy bastard.

13:30.473 --> 13:31.810
You hate Ron, right?

13:32.425 --> 13:35.230
- No, I think Ron is fine.
- So we're on the same page.

13:35.738 --> 13:38.275
You got to help me take him down.
There's got to be something on him.

13:38.615 --> 13:41.205
I'm starting to feel
kind of gross about this game.

13:41.425 --> 13:44.055
It's not about the game anymore.
Ron has some serious dirt on me.

13:44.180 --> 13:46.622
I need to balance things out.
You must know how that feels.

13:46.747 --> 13:49.327
You got tons of dirt in your past.
Please, you gotta help me.

13:52.258 --> 13:54.602
There is a man named Duke Silver.

13:55.307 --> 13:57.294
He hangs out at a bar in eagleton.

13:58.073 --> 13:59.753
He's an old friend of Ron's.

13:59.923 --> 14:02.381
- Maybe you should ask him.
- Thanks, man.

14:02.577 --> 14:04.262
I'm gonna dig up so much dirt,

14:04.387 --> 14:06.987
there's gonna be worms
all over the place.

14:09.099 --> 14:10.849
It sounded snappier in my head.

14:11.581 --> 14:12.976
Ann is so awesome.

14:13.208 --> 14:15.298
I'm lucky to have a friend
who would spend a whole day

14:15.423 --> 14:16.690
being so mean to me.

14:18.817 --> 14:19.617
Catch.

14:19.742 --> 14:22.028
I don't need your dress.
I'm gonna wear my own stuff.

14:22.153 --> 14:22.968
Me power.

14:23.093 --> 14:26.114
Good.
You're officially first date-proof.

14:26.283 --> 14:27.378
Thank you, Dave.

14:28.129 --> 14:31.579
Listen... It is impossible
that he's not gonna like you.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.597
He's gonna freak out
about how awesome you are.

14:33.722 --> 14:36.432
- No, he's not.
- Yes, he is. He's gonna love you.

14:36.557 --> 14:39.940
You're cool, and you're sexy,
and you're funny, and you're smart.

14:40.338 --> 14:42.374
Any guy would be lucky to date you.

14:42.718 --> 14:45.549
- Yeah! Hell, yeah!
- Hell, yeah! I am awesome!

14:45.718 --> 14:47.219
- You are awesome.
- Yeah!

14:47.460 --> 14:48.710
And you are, too.

14:48.835 --> 14:50.305
- Thank you.
- You are, too.

14:50.473 --> 14:52.240
- Thank you.
- You are, too!

14:53.060 --> 14:54.518
You're awesome.

14:58.128 --> 14:59.282
Help, police!

14:59.566 --> 15:00.616
Help! Help!

15:04.539 --> 15:06.088
Look, I know today is...

15:06.562 --> 15:10.079
today... And it's not tomorrow
but I felt like you should know that

15:10.204 --> 15:12.536
I'm awesome,
and you're lucky to have me.

15:12.859 --> 15:14.829
And I think
our first date tomorrow's

15:14.998 --> 15:16.898
gonna go awesome, off the charts.

15:17.023 --> 15:18.083
Amazing. Up top.

15:20.371 --> 15:22.319
All right, let's do this bitch!

15:22.857 --> 15:24.107
I'm not scared.

15:24.421 --> 15:25.674
Can I come in?

15:25.843 --> 15:27.997
'Cause I walked here
'cause of the drinking.

15:28.122 --> 15:29.875
- I don't know.
- I do know.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.290
I'm coming inside, so move.
Okay?

15:32.932 --> 15:34.975
You make a better door than a guy.

15:37.895 --> 15:41.106
This is gonna sound weird.
I'm looking for a guy named Duke Silver.

15:41.821 --> 15:43.483
Yeah, he goes on in a second.

15:44.262 --> 15:47.453
<i>Ladies, ladies, ladies,
it's just about that time.</i>

15:47.578 --> 15:50.333
<i>It's with the jazziest pleasure
that I bring out for you</i>

15:50.458 --> 15:53.402
<i>my man, Mr. Duke Silver.</i>

15:58.695 --> 16:00.041
Thank you, Dwayne.

16:00.209 --> 16:02.422
As always, it is a thrill
to be here during

16:02.547 --> 16:04.671
this witching hour
with you lovely ladies.

16:05.345 --> 16:07.893
Now relax
and let the Duke Silver Trio

16:08.018 --> 16:10.552
take you on a little journey...
to yourself.

16:26.023 --> 16:28.033
Ann was helping me,

16:28.417 --> 16:30.739
because I was panicking
about tomorrow.

16:31.711 --> 16:33.861
Did I say something
to make you worry about to...

16:33.986 --> 16:34.951
No, just...

16:35.389 --> 16:36.828
the whole idea of first dates

16:36.996 --> 16:38.474
just kind of freak me out.

16:38.826 --> 16:39.748
Not anymore.

16:40.629 --> 16:43.967
I can't even believe that I was
scared to go on a date with you.

16:44.117 --> 16:45.712
You should be scared of me.

16:47.669 --> 16:49.632
I think I need
to return this sweater.

16:49.992 --> 16:52.677
I think it fused with my shirt
in the dryer or something.

16:53.081 --> 16:55.347
I think that's
a sweater-shirt combo.

16:57.834 --> 17:00.163
I think it's going
pretty well with Dave.

17:00.960 --> 17:03.693
He wants me.
I can totally tell that he wants me.

17:03.818 --> 17:06.214
I'm right here.
You know I'm here, right?

17:08.281 --> 17:09.609
Did you see my bra?

17:11.721 --> 17:13.865
I'm wearing the hot one tomorrow,
the black one.

17:14.248 --> 17:15.867
Can I use your bathroom?

17:16.450 --> 17:18.369
Are you impressed
that I know what it's called?

17:18.538 --> 17:21.156
- I ought to give you a lift home.
- Good. Well, in London,

17:21.281 --> 17:22.782
they call the elevators lifts,

17:22.907 --> 17:25.587
- you're gonna give me an elevator home?
- OK, let's go.

17:26.671 --> 17:28.924
Let's go down to the pub...

17:29.049 --> 17:30.548
- That's right.
- Get a pint.

17:30.673 --> 17:33.171
We'll put our knickers
in the beatle records.

17:33.296 --> 17:34.636
This is an English accent.

17:34.804 --> 17:37.494
What I cannot believe
is Dexhart's wife.

17:37.619 --> 17:39.371
I mean, how clueless can you get?

17:39.496 --> 17:42.158
How did she not know
this was going on?

17:42.436 --> 17:44.626
More importantly,
how does she stay with him

17:44.751 --> 17:46.001
after all this?

17:47.900 --> 17:50.508
Can I help you at...

17:50.633 --> 17:51.883
11:48 PM?

17:52.280 --> 17:54.698
OK, here's the whole thing.
Here are all my skeletons.

17:55.207 --> 17:57.909
When I was 16, I had sex
with a married woman.

17:58.078 --> 17:59.577
- Right.
- When I was in college,

17:59.745 --> 18:01.845
I smoked a decent amount of pot.

18:02.142 --> 18:04.586
- Nothing insane.
- What the hell are you doing?

18:04.711 --> 18:08.544
I'm trying to tell you that I've done
some stuff that I'm not very proud of,

18:08.914 --> 18:11.423
and I like you, so I would rather
you not find out about this

18:11.592 --> 18:13.466
from anyone but me.

18:13.591 --> 18:14.884
This was a bad idea.

18:15.873 --> 18:17.887
No, no, it's... It's fine.

18:18.361 --> 18:19.680
I get what this is

18:19.850 --> 18:21.247
and why you did it.

18:23.016 --> 18:25.478
Is there anythingyou would like
to share from your past

18:25.646 --> 18:27.326
to sort of balance the scales?

18:28.213 --> 18:30.350
One time, this guy rang
my doorbell at midnight

18:30.475 --> 18:32.986
to brag about getting laid
when he was 16, so I shot him.

18:33.155 --> 18:33.987
Good night.

18:35.791 --> 18:38.867
It's been a real gift making
sonic love to you tonight.

18:39.738 --> 18:42.863
If you want more of the Duke,
both my albums are for sale here...

18:42.988 --> 18:45.150
<i>Smooth as Silver</i> and <i>Hi ho, Duke.</i>

18:46.004 --> 18:47.995
And look for my new CD next month,

18:48.120 --> 18:50.220
<i>Memories of Now.</i>

18:51.118 --> 18:54.268
So come see me, come talk to me,
come love with me,

18:54.748 --> 18:57.259
and maybe we can
walk through fire together.

18:57.488 --> 18:58.750
Thank you.
Good night.

19:04.633 --> 19:05.453
Duke!

19:05.943 --> 19:07.166
Huge fan.

19:12.447 --> 19:15.694
Look, Tom, I imagine you'll want
to tell everyone about this,

19:15.864 --> 19:18.850
but I have worked pretty hard
to cultivate a certain authoritative

19:18.975 --> 19:20.800
or intimidating image
around the office.

19:20.925 --> 19:22.786
- Can I get a picture?
- Sure.

19:23.269 --> 19:26.174
- Say, "I bested you".
- I bested you.

19:27.469 --> 19:29.532
All right.
Thanks for lovin' the Duke.

19:30.378 --> 19:31.461
Lovely photo.

19:32.337 --> 19:34.172
- Truce?
- Truce.

19:36.061 --> 19:38.273
- You're kidding me.
- No, I'm not.

19:38.594 --> 19:41.757
You showed up at the guy's house,
in the middle of the night, drunk,

19:42.623 --> 19:43.972
you didn't sleep with him?

19:44.141 --> 19:46.165
- Should I have?
- It never hurts.

19:54.632 --> 19:57.484
You... You left quite a bit of stuff
at my place last night...

19:57.609 --> 20:00.573
purse and earrings and a shoe.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.367
I am so sorry about last night.

20:02.536 --> 20:06.219
On my list of embarrassing things
that I've done in my life, that was...

20:06.485 --> 20:08.128
numbers one through seven.

20:08.658 --> 20:11.292
- I understand if you want to cancel.
- It's okay.

20:11.460 --> 20:13.711
You can make it up to me tonight
on our second date.

20:14.719 --> 20:15.643
2nd?

20:15.941 --> 20:18.758
Last night was our first date,
so that would make tonight our second.

20:19.078 --> 20:20.559
I'm looking forward to it.

20:20.730 --> 20:21.645
8:00?

20:22.588 --> 20:23.471
8:00.

20:24.854 --> 20:26.474
- You like dancing?
- Yeah.

20:26.997 --> 20:29.561
- I don't like dancing.
- We don't have to go.

20:30.082 --> 20:32.814
Well, we went on our first date,
and I didn't even know it,

20:33.218 --> 20:34.467
a.k.a. I nailed it.

20:35.737 --> 20:37.728
No fires, no ambulances.

20:38.311 --> 20:42.042
Just good old-fashioned showing up
drunk at a guy's house late at night.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.960
<i>However, I want to be clear.</i>

20:46.878 --> 20:49.163
<i>I have no plans to resign.</i>

20:50.034 --> 20:53.920
Is it weird that my feelings are hurt
that no one's found any dirt on me yet?

20:55.352 --> 20:56.302
Hello!

20:56.775 --> 20:59.549
I drove a riding lawn mower
through a Nordstrom!

21:00.841 --> 21:02.641
There's video that I took!

21:03.088 --> 21:04.429
It's on the Internet.

21:07.341 --> 21:08.141
Nothing.

21:09.272 --> 21:11.262
Jerry, plastic surgery?

21:14.495 --> 21:16.345
I got hit by a fire engine.

21:17.748 --> 21:19.110
You are so lucky.

21:19.437 --> 21:20.331
How?
