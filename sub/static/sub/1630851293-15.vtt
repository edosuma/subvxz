00:30.866 --> 00:32.100
WELCOME TO THE SHOW, STILL

00:32.166 --> 00:33.166
COMING TO YOU FROM THIS BLANK

00:33.233 --> 00:33.700
VOID.

00:33.766 --> 00:35.033
ENTERTAINMENT'S MOST UPSETTING

00:35.100 --> 00:36.133
BASTION OF WHITENESS, NOT

00:36.200 --> 00:36.933
COUNTING THE HOLLYWOOD FOREIGN

00:37.000 --> 00:38.800
PRESS ASSOCIATION.

00:38.866 --> 00:40.333
IT'S BEEN ANOTHER BUSY WEEK.

00:40.400 --> 00:41.333
BIDEN MET WITH G7 LEADERS,

00:41.400 --> 00:43.000
JEFF BEZOS ANNOUNCED HE'LL BE

HEADING TO SPACE ON THE WORLD'S

00:44.166 --> 00:45.600
FIRST CIRCUMCISED SPACECRAFT,

00:45.666 --> 00:47.666
AND AN INTERNET CONSPIRACY ABOUT

00:47.733 --> 00:49.133
PEOPLE BECOMING MAGNETIC AFTER

00:49.200 --> 00:51.333
GETTING VACCINATED TURNED UP AT

00:51.400 --> 00:53.033
THE OHIO STATE HOUSE:

00:53.100 --> 00:54.966
>> WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

00:55.033 --> 00:57.366
DR. TENPENNY'S TESTIMONY ABOUT

00:57.433 --> 00:59.033
MAGNETIC VACCINE CRYSTALS.

00:59.100 --> 00:59.933
SO THIS IS WHAT I FOUND OUT.

01:00.000 --> 01:00.566
SO I HAVE A KEY AND A BOBBY PIN

01:00.633 --> 01:03.100
HERE.

01:03.166 --> 01:04.933
EXPLAIN TO ME WHY THE KEY STICKS

01:05.000 --> 01:11.100
TO ME.

01:11.166 --> 01:14.833
IT STICKS TO MY NECK TOO.

01:14.900 --> 01:16.566
YEAH, SO IF SOMEBODY CAN

01:16.633 --> 01:17.133
EXPLAIN THIS, THAT WOULD BE

01:17.200 --> 01:20.333
GREAT.

01:20.400 --> 01:21.833
>> John: UM, SURE, I CAN TRY TO

01:21.900 --> 01:23.166
EXPLAIN WHAT THIS IS -- VERY

01:23.233 --> 01:23.966
BASICALLY, PUBLIC EDUCATION IS

01:24.033 --> 01:24.666
HORRIBLY UNDERFUNDED AND

01:24.733 --> 01:25.266
SCIENTIFIC LITERACY IS NOWHERE

01:25.333 --> 01:26.666
NEAR WHAT IT SHOULD BE IN THIS

01:26.733 --> 01:27.433
COUNTRY, CREATING A VACUUM OF

01:27.500 --> 01:29.300
TRUST IN LEGITIMATE RESEARCH.

01:29.366 --> 01:30.833
MEANWHILE, PEOPLE TEND TO SEEK

01:30.900 --> 01:33.066
OUT THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF

01:33.133 --> 01:34.200
INFORMATION THAT LETS THEM KEEP

01:34.266 --> 01:35.433
BELIEVING WHAT THEY ALREADY

01:35.500 --> 01:36.633
BELIEVE -- IN YOUR CASE, THAT

01:36.700 --> 01:37.666
YOU'RE PRIVY TO SECRET KNOWLEDGE

01:37.733 --> 01:39.500
ABOUT A GOVERNMENT CONSPIRACY TO

01:39.566 --> 01:41.600
MAGNETIZE THE PEOPLE OF OHIO.

01:41.666 --> 01:43.166
ALL OF THAT IS PROBABLY WHY YOU

01:43.233 --> 01:45.333
FELT CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO TRUST

01:45.400 --> 01:46.766
SOME BULLSHIT YOU READ ONLINE SO

01:46.833 --> 01:47.866
MUCH YOU WERE WILLING TO LOOK

01:47.933 --> 01:48.833
LIKE A COMPLETE ASSHOLE IN FRONT

01:48.900 --> 01:49.666
OF ALL THESE PEOPLE.

01:49.733 --> 01:51.666
OH, AND IF YOU JUST MEANT THE

01:51.733 --> 01:52.433
KEY THING -- PEOPLE ARE

01:52.500 --> 01:53.333
SOMETIMES STICKY.

01:53.400 --> 01:55.000
WE'RE ALL KIND OF MOIST AND

01:55.066 --> 01:55.533
GROSS AND KEYS STICK TO US

01:55.600 --> 01:57.366
SOMETIMES.

01:57.433 --> 01:59.933
THAT'S IT.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.266
MEANWHILE, IN NEW YORK, THE NEWS

02:01.333 --> 02:02.566
HAS BEEN DOMINATED BY THE RACE

02:02.633 --> 02:03.500
FOR MAYOR.

02:03.566 --> 02:04.900
EARLY VOTING IN THE PRIMARIES

02:04.966 --> 02:05.666
STARTED YESTERDAY, AND FOR THE

02:05.733 --> 02:07.000
FIRST TIME, THE CITY'S USING

02:07.066 --> 02:08.300
RANKED CHOICE VOTING --

02:08.366 --> 02:09.133
SOMETHING THE CURRENT MAYOR

02:09.200 --> 02:12.133
CHOSE TO EXPLAIN BY IMAGINING A

02:12.200 --> 02:14.033
PIZZA-TOPPING ELECTION:

02:14.100 --> 02:17.300
>> GREEN PEPPERS, LADIES AND

02:17.366 --> 02:18.666
GENTLEMEN, RIGHT HERE, MY NUMBER

02:18.733 --> 02:18.966
ONE CHOICE.

02:19.033 --> 02:19.800
NOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T

02:19.866 --> 02:20.866
APPRECIATE GREEN PEPPERS ENOUGH.

02:20.933 --> 02:21.500
NUMBER TWO: OLIVES, OKAY?

02:21.566 --> 02:22.700
THIS ONE'S A LITTLE

02:22.766 --> 02:23.666
CONTROVERSIAL.

02:23.733 --> 02:25.400
USUALLY IT'S BLACK OLIVES, COULD

02:25.466 --> 02:27.066
BE GREEN OLIVES, SOME PEOPLE

02:27.133 --> 02:28.333
THINK OLIVES BELONG ON A PIZZA,

02:28.400 --> 02:29.233
SOME PEOPLE ARE REALLY AGAINST

02:29.300 --> 02:31.066
IT, BUT I HAVE HAD VERY GOOD

02:31.133 --> 02:33.066
EXPERIENCES WITH OLIVES.

02:33.133 --> 02:34.933
>> John: THAT IS UNHINGED.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.800
GREEN PEPPERS AS YOUR NUMBER ONE

02:36.866 --> 02:38.433
CHOICE?

02:38.500 --> 02:39.700
GREEN PEPPERS AREN'T EVEN MY

02:39.766 --> 02:41.166
NUMBER ONE PEPPER.

02:41.233 --> 02:43.333
THEY'RE JUST UNRIPE RED ONES.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.033
THERE ISN'T EVEN A GREEN PEPPER

02:45.100 --> 02:46.366
CHARACTER IN THE "VEGGIETALES"

02:46.433 --> 02:48.266
UNIVERSE, BECAUSE THEY DISPROVE

02:48.333 --> 02:50.533
THE EXISTENCE OF A LOVING GOD.

02:50.600 --> 02:51.900
AND YOUR SECOND CHOICE IS

02:51.966 --> 02:52.866
OLIVES?

02:52.933 --> 02:54.700
ON A PIZZA?

02:54.766 --> 02:55.733
THAT YOU PLAN TO EAT WITH YOUR

02:55.800 --> 02:57.800
ACTUAL MOUTH?

02:57.866 --> 02:59.933
UNACCEPTABLE, BILL!

03:00.000 --> 03:01.233
THE RACE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC

03:01.300 --> 03:03.300
NOMINEE IS VERY MUCH IN FLUX.

03:03.366 --> 03:05.000
MAYA WILEY HAS BEEN SHORING UP

03:05.066 --> 03:06.500
PROGRESSIVE SUPPORT, WHILE A

03:06.566 --> 03:08.400
CONSISTENT FRONTRUNNER, FORMER

03:08.466 --> 03:10.000
POLICE OFFICER ERIC ADAMS, HAD

03:10.066 --> 03:12.433
TO DEFEND HIMSELF THIS WEEK FROM

03:12.500 --> 03:14.500
A PRETTY UNUSUAL ATTACK.

03:14.566 --> 03:15.666
>> DEMOCRAT ERIC ADAMS, A

03:15.733 --> 03:17.066
LEADING CONTENDER IN NEW YORK

03:17.133 --> 03:18.366
CITY'S MAYORAL RACE, TODAY

03:18.433 --> 03:19.700
INSISTING HE REALLY DOES LIVE IN

03:19.766 --> 03:21.233
NEW YORK.

03:21.300 --> 03:22.800
>> THIS IS OUR SMALL, HUMBLE

03:22.866 --> 03:23.900
KITCHEN.

03:23.966 --> 03:25.666
>> TAKING REPORTERS ON A TOUR OF

03:25.733 --> 03:26.933
HIS BROOKLYN PAD AFTER A

03:27.000 --> 03:29.133
POLITICO PIECE RAISED QUESTIONS

03:29.200 --> 03:30.133
ABOUT WHETHER OTHER TENANTS WERE

03:30.200 --> 03:32.100
REALLY LIVING IN THE APARTMENT,

03:32.166 --> 03:34.100
IF ADAMS IS SPENDING HIS TIME AT

03:34.166 --> 03:35.933
A PROPERTY HE OWNS WITH HIS

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
PARTNER IN NEW JERSEY, OR IF HIS

03:38.066 --> 03:40.133
HOME IS ACTUALLY HIS OFFICE.

03:40.200 --> 03:41.366
>> John: YEAH.

03:41.433 --> 03:47.200
ERIC ADAMS HAD TO GIVE REPORTERS

03:47.266 --> 03:49.033
A TOUR OF A BROOKLYN APARTMENT

03:49.100 --> 03:49.800
TO PROVE HE LIVED THERE AND NOT

03:49.866 --> 03:50.400
IN NEW JERSEY.

03:50.466 --> 03:51.300
WHICH ALREADY DOESN'T LOOK GOOD,

03:51.366 --> 03:52.100
PARTLY BECAUSE HE ATTACKED

03:52.166 --> 03:52.966
ANDREW YANG FOR LEAVING THE CITY

03:53.033 --> 03:54.333
DURING THE PANDEMIC AND PARTLY

03:54.400 --> 03:55.533
BECAUSE HIS ARGUMENT THAT HE

03:55.600 --> 03:57.000
LIVES IN THAT BASEMENT APARTMENT

03:57.066 --> 03:57.900
RAISES MANY MORE QUESTIONS THAN

03:57.966 --> 03:59.700
IT ANSWERS.

03:59.766 --> 04:00.966
TWITTER DETECTIVES FLAGGED

04:01.033 --> 04:03.433
INCONSISTENCIES -- LIKE THE FACT

04:03.500 --> 04:06.100
THAT, IN 2017, ADAMS TWEETED A

04:06.166 --> 04:07.500
PHOTOGRAPH OF HIS #PlantBased

04:07.566 --> 04:09.733
FRIDGE IN #BedStuy.

04:09.800 --> 04:12.400
BUT ON THIS WEEK'S TOUR, THAT

04:12.466 --> 04:13.366
PLANT-BASED FRIDGE WAS NOWHERE

04:13.433 --> 04:14.766
TO BE FOUND.

04:14.833 --> 04:16.000
BECAUSE THIS WAS THE FRIDGE IN

04:16.066 --> 04:17.366
THE APARTMENT, WHICH YOU MIGHT

04:17.433 --> 04:18.733
NOTICE PROMINENTLY FEATURES

04:18.800 --> 04:20.366
SALMON, SOMETHING ADAMS CLAIMS

04:20.433 --> 04:21.266
BELONGS TO HIS SON, WHO LIVES

04:21.333 --> 04:22.333
THERE WITH HIM.

04:22.400 --> 04:23.933
ALTHOUGH EVERYTHING ABOUT THAT

04:24.000 --> 04:25.833
APARTMENT -- FROM THE DECOR TO

04:25.900 --> 04:27.200
THE FRIDGE -- SUGGESTS IT'S

04:27.266 --> 04:29.500
ACTUALLY HIS SON WHO LIVES

04:29.566 --> 04:30.300
THERE AND ADAMS WHO MIGHT

04:30.366 --> 04:31.433
OCCASIONALLY STAY WITH HIM.

04:31.500 --> 04:32.633
AND LOOK, IS THIS THE MOST

04:32.700 --> 04:34.800
IMPORTANT THING?

04:34.866 --> 04:35.900
NO, NOT REALLY.

04:35.966 --> 04:37.066
BUT IT IS WEIRD, AND THE WAY

04:37.133 --> 04:38.266
HE'S CHOOSING TO HANDLE IT IS

04:38.333 --> 04:40.066
EVEN WEIRDER.

04:40.133 --> 04:41.366
AND THE THING IS, THAT'S NOT

04:41.433 --> 04:42.900
EVEN THE STRANGEST HOUSE TOUR

04:42.966 --> 04:44.433
ADAMS HAS GIVEN, BECAUSE AS A

04:44.500 --> 04:46.433
STATE SENATOR IN 2011, HE

04:46.500 --> 04:48.500
RELEASED THIS VIDEO TEACHING

04:48.566 --> 04:49.933
PARENTS HOW TO SEARCH FOR

04:50.000 --> 04:51.366
CONTRABAND THEIR KIDS MIGHT BE

04:51.433 --> 04:52.800
HIDING:

04:52.866 --> 04:54.500
>> A JEWELRY BOX OF THIS NATURE

04:54.566 --> 04:55.533
MAY BE A SIMPLE JEWELRY BOX, BUT

04:55.600 --> 04:56.966
IF YOU LOOK THROUGH IT CLOSELY,

04:57.033 --> 04:57.566
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR CHILD

04:57.633 --> 04:59.133
MAY BE HIDING.

04:59.200 --> 04:59.733
FOR INSTANCE, A GUN COULD BE

04:59.800 --> 05:01.066
HIDDEN.

05:01.133 --> 05:02.366
A SMALL-CALIBER WEAPON COULD BE

05:02.433 --> 05:06.133
HIDDEN INSIDE A JEWELRY BOX.

05:06.200 --> 05:06.700
WHEN YOUR CHILD BRING IN HIS

05:06.766 --> 05:07.266
POPULAR KNAPSACK WITH MANY

05:07.333 --> 05:08.733
DIFFERENT LOCATIONS.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.300
LOOK THROUGH IT TO SEE WHAT

05:10.366 --> 05:13.200
EXACTLY IS YOUR CHILD CARRYING

05:13.266 --> 05:14.600
IN ADDITION TO A BOOK?

05:14.666 --> 05:15.966
SOMETHING SIMPLE AS A CRACK

05:16.033 --> 05:17.833
PIPE, A USED CRACK PIPE.

05:17.900 --> 05:18.733
BEHIND A PICTURE FRAME YOU COULD

05:18.800 --> 05:20.666
FIND BULLETS.

05:20.733 --> 05:22.333
A BABY DOLL -- COULD BE JUST A

05:22.400 --> 05:24.500
BABY DOLL BUT ALSO IT COULD BE A

05:24.566 --> 05:25.166
PLACE WHERE YOU COULD SECRETE OR

05:25.233 --> 05:26.833
HIDE DRUGS.

05:26.900 --> 05:27.833
>> John: HONESTLY, THAT'S ALL

05:27.900 --> 05:28.766
GREAT, FROM THE BULLETS BEHIND

05:28.833 --> 05:29.966
THE PICTURE FRAME TO THE

05:30.033 --> 05:30.866
"POPULAR KNAPSACK" TO THE WEIRD

05:30.933 --> 05:32.366
MUSIC.

05:32.433 --> 05:33.700
BUT I WANT TO FOCUS ON THE DOLL.

05:33.766 --> 05:35.633
BECAUSE WHAT DOES ERIC ADAMS

05:35.700 --> 05:37.433
THINK A CHILD IS?

05:37.500 --> 05:39.033
IN HIS SCENARIO, YOUR CHILD IS

05:39.100 --> 05:40.666
YOUNG ENOUGH TO BE PLAYING WITH

05:40.733 --> 05:41.700
BABY DOLLS YET ALSO OLD ENOUGH

05:41.766 --> 05:43.966
TO BE DOING DRUGS.

05:44.033 --> 05:45.633
WHAT YEAR OF LIFE ENCOMPASSES

05:45.700 --> 05:47.533
BOTH THOSE ACTIVITIES?

05:47.600 --> 05:48.633
SIX AND A HALF?

05:48.700 --> 05:56.400
MAYBE?

05:56.466 --> 05:57.866
LOOK, ERIC ADAMS IS CLEARLY A

05:57.933 --> 06:12.566
VERY ODD MAN,

06:12.633 --> 06:13.500
BUT HE'S NOT ALONE IN THAT.

06:13.566 --> 06:14.100
ONE OF HIS CLOSEST RIVALS IS

06:14.166 --> 06:14.800
ANDREW YANG -- THE ANSWER TO THE

06:14.866 --> 06:15.400
QUESTION, "WHAT IF THE CONCEPT

06:15.466 --> 06:16.000
OF 'DABBING' WAS A PERSON?" --

06:16.066 --> 06:16.533
WHO, ON NATIONAL PETS DAY,

06:16.600 --> 06:17.133
POSTED, "CELEBRATING OUR DOG,

06:17.200 --> 06:17.700
GRIZZLY, WHO WE RAISED AS A

06:17.766 --> 06:18.333
PUPPY BUT HAD TO GIVE AWAY

06:18.400 --> 06:18.933
BECAUSE ONE OF OUR BOYS BECAME

06:19.000 --> 06:19.400
ALLERGIC TO HIM.

06:19.466 --> 06:20.000
MISS YOU, GRIZZ!

06:20.066 --> 06:20.666
#DogsForYang."

06:20.733 --> 06:21.433
AND IF YOU GAVE AWAY YOUR DOG,

06:21.500 --> 06:22.300
YOU CAN JUST NOT POST ANYTHING

06:22.366 --> 06:22.833
ON NATIONAL PETS DAY.

06:22.900 --> 06:23.600
EVEN IF YOU HAVE A DOG, YOU

06:23.666 --> 06:24.200
DON'T HAVE TO POST ANYTHING.

06:24.266 --> 06:24.833
YOUR DOG'S NOT GOING TO CARE

06:24.900 --> 06:25.400
EITHER WAY.

06:25.466 --> 06:26.633
DOGS DON'T KNOW WHAT TWITTER IS.

06:26.700 --> 06:27.133
IT'S WHY THEY'RE HAPPY.

06:27.200 --> 06:27.766
AND OTHER CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN

06:27.833 --> 06:28.500
FUCKING UP SOME PRETTY BASIC

06:28.566 --> 06:28.966
QUESTIONS.

06:29.033 --> 06:29.933
>> AS THE "NEW YORK TIMES"

06:30.000 --> 06:30.533
GRILLED THE CANDIDATES, SOME

06:30.600 --> 06:31.466
WERE STUMPED WHEN ASKED IF THEY

06:31.533 --> 06:32.833
COULD NAME THE MEDIAN PURCHASE

06:32.900 --> 06:34.466
PRICE OF A HOME IN BROOKLYN.

06:34.533 --> 06:36.100
RAY McGUIRE, A BANKING

06:36.166 --> 06:37.733
EXECUTIVE, SAID, "IT'S GOT TO BE

06:37.800 --> 06:39.366
SOMEWHERE IN THE $80,000 TO

06:39.433 --> 06:41.766
$90,000 RANGE, IF NOT HIGHER."

06:41.833 --> 06:43.233
AND SHAUN DONOVAN, FORMER

06:43.300 --> 06:45.966
FEDERAL HOUSING SECRETARY, HE

06:46.033 --> 06:47.466
SAID, "IN BROOKLYN, HUH?

06:47.533 --> 06:48.833
I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE.

06:48.900 --> 06:50.200
I WOULD GUESS IT'S AROUND

06:50.266 --> 06:52.366
$100,000."

06:52.433 --> 06:53.900
>> John: WELL, YOU GUESSED

06:53.966 --> 06:55.266
WRONG, BECAUSE THE NUMBER IS

06:55.333 --> 06:56.933
ACTUALLY $900,000.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.666
WHICH IS A REAL PROBLEM,

06:58.733 --> 07:00.300
BECAUSE IF THESE GUYS WANT TO

07:00.366 --> 07:01.966
RUN A CITY WITH AN AFFORDABLE

07:02.033 --> 07:03.300
HOUSING CRISIS, THEY MIGHT WANT

07:03.366 --> 07:04.933
TO LOOK AT THE TOP ZILLOW SEARCH

07:05.000 --> 07:07.900
RESULT FOR BROOKLYN HOMES ON

07:07.966 --> 07:08.700
SALE FOR LESS THAN $100,000,

07:08.766 --> 07:09.866
WHICH IS -- AND THIS IS TRUE --

07:09.933 --> 07:11.133
THIS EMPTY LOT THAT LOOKS LIKE

07:11.200 --> 07:12.200
THE SETTING OF A FILTHY PIGEON

07:12.266 --> 07:14.066
ORGY.

07:14.133 --> 07:15.833
BUT IF SOME CANDIDATES HAVE

07:15.900 --> 07:17.266
SEEMED OUT-OF-TOUCH, OTHERS HAVE

07:17.333 --> 07:18.733
SEEMED A LITTLE TOO EAGER TO

07:18.800 --> 07:20.266
SHARE.

07:20.333 --> 07:21.800
WHEN "NEW YORK MAGAZINE" ASKED

07:21.866 --> 07:23.200
ALL THE CANDIDATES ABOUT THE

07:23.266 --> 07:24.500
ITEMS THEY CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT,

07:24.566 --> 07:26.266
REPUBLICAN FERNANDO MATEO

07:26.333 --> 07:27.566
OFFERED UP, "QUILTED NORTHERN

07:27.633 --> 07:29.333
ULTRA PLUSH TOILET PAPER,"

07:29.400 --> 07:31.000
EXPLAINING, "I HAVE BIG, STRONG

07:31.066 --> 07:32.200
HANDS, SO I NEED TOILET PAPER

07:32.266 --> 07:33.966
THAT WON'T BREAK WHEN I'M WIPING

07:34.033 --> 07:35.966
MY BUTT."

07:36.033 --> 07:37.833
AND THAT'S ALREADY GREAT -- IT'S

07:37.900 --> 07:38.966
FUNNY, CANDID, AND HE SAYS

07:39.033 --> 07:42.033
"WIPING MY BUTT."

07:42.100 --> 07:43.033
IT'S EXCELLENT.

07:43.100 --> 07:44.066
BUT HE DIDN'T STOP THERE.

07:44.133 --> 07:44.900
BECAUSE HE CONTINUED, "THIS HAS

07:44.966 --> 07:46.066
THAT TOUGHNESS, BUT IT'S SOFT

07:46.133 --> 07:47.500
ENOUGH FOR MY SENSITIVE AREAS."

07:47.566 --> 07:49.566
SO ALREADY SOMETHING THAT

07:49.633 --> 07:51.100
STARTED AS A PUFF PIECE ABOUT

07:51.166 --> 07:52.633
FAVORITE PRODUCTS HAS TURNED

07:52.700 --> 07:54.266
INTO MATEO FORCING YOU TO THINK

07:54.333 --> 07:56.300
ABOUT HIS SENSITIVE ANUS.

07:56.366 --> 07:57.833
AND HE CLOSES STRONG, SAYING,

07:57.900 --> 07:59.200
"I'VE USED OTHER TOILET PAPER

07:59.266 --> 07:59.933
AND MY HAND HAS RIPPED RIGHT

08:00.000 --> 08:00.966
THROUGH IT.

08:01.033 --> 08:06.766
IT'S A MESS."

08:06.833 --> 08:08.633
I USUALLY WRAP THE PAPER AROUND

08:08.700 --> 08:10.033
MY HEAD A FEW TIMES JUST SO IT

08:10.100 --> 08:11.033
DOESN'T BREAK."

08:11.100 --> 08:11.933
AND COME ON!

08:12.000 --> 08:12.833
NOW WE'RE IN AN EXISTENTIAL

08:12.900 --> 08:13.666
TRAGEDY.

08:13.733 --> 08:14.533
HE'S LIKE LENNIE SMALL OR

08:14.600 --> 08:15.400
FRANKENSTEIN'S MONSTER -- A

08:15.466 --> 08:16.566
PHYSICAL BEHEMOTH ENRAPTURED BY

08:16.633 --> 08:18.200
THE LURE OF SOFT BEAUTY, BUT

08:18.266 --> 08:19.633
SADLY, THESE CURSED BRUTE HANDS

08:19.700 --> 08:21.633
KNOW ONLY DESTRUCTION.

08:21.700 --> 08:23.966
IT'S JUST MAGNIFICENT.

08:24.033 --> 08:25.633
IF MATEO DOESN'T GET ELECTED

08:25.700 --> 08:29.933
MAYOR, HE'D AT LEAST MAKE A

08:30.000 --> 08:31.266
MUCH BETTER TOILET PAPER

08:31.333 --> 08:31.966
SPOKESMAN THAN THOSE WEIRD

08:32.033 --> 08:32.733
SHITTING BEARS.

08:32.800 --> 08:33.500
AND LOOK, IF YOU'RE THINKING,

08:33.566 --> 08:34.833
"THERE SURE ARE A LOT OF WEIRDOS

08:34.900 --> 08:35.866
RUNNING FOR MAYOR OF NEW YORK,"

08:35.933 --> 08:37.300
YEAH, OF COURSE THERE ARE.

08:37.366 --> 08:39.633
BECAUSE BEING A WEIRDO IN THIS

08:39.700 --> 08:40.766
CITY ISN'T A DISQUALIFIER, IT'S

08:40.833 --> 08:42.500
A PREREQUISITE.

08:42.566 --> 08:45.033
THINK ABOUT IT: OUR LAST THREE

08:45.100 --> 08:46.233
MAYORS WERE 9/11 NOSFERATU, A

08:46.300 --> 08:49.033
BILLIONAIRE ELF, AND THE GOOBER

08:49.100 --> 08:51.066
THAT YOU JUST SAW SAY OUT LOUD,

08:51.133 --> 08:52.400
"I HAVE HAD VERY GOOD

08:52.466 --> 08:53.700
EXPERIENCES WITH OLIVES."

08:53.766 --> 08:55.466
"WEIRD" IS KIND OF A JOB

08:55.533 --> 08:59.500
REQUIREMENT.

08:59.566 --> 09:00.100
AND WHILE IT WOULD BE GREAT IF

09:00.166 --> 09:00.800
CANDIDATES COULD BE GOOD AT

09:00.866 --> 09:01.733
OTHER STUFF AS WELL, THERE'S NO

09:01.800 --> 09:02.633
DENYING THAT THE NEW YORK

09:02.700 --> 09:03.966
MAYOR'S OFFICE ISN'T JUST AN

09:04.033 --> 09:05.466
OPPORTUNITY FOR INNOVATIVE

09:05.533 --> 09:07.200
LEADERSHIP, IT'S ALSO A CALLING

09:07.266 --> 09:09.666
TO SPEND AT LEAST FOUR YEARS AS

09:09.733 --> 09:11.166
THE WEIRD PERSON ON TV EVERYONE

09:11.233 --> 09:12.133
GETS MAD AT FOR EATING PIZZA

09:12.200 --> 09:13.733
WRONG.

09:13.800 --> 09:18.933
AND NOW THIS.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.933
>> Announcer: AND NOW, SOMEONE

09:21.000 --> 09:23.933
PLEASE STOP STUART VARNEY I'M

09:24.000 --> 09:24.300
SAYING THIS.

09:24.366 --> 09:27.066
>> COME BACK TO THE SHOW ANYTIME

09:27.133 --> 09:28.833
YOU LIKE, OKAY?

09:28.900 --> 09:30.300
>> IT'S MY FAVORITE SHOW.

09:30.366 --> 09:32.600
I HOPE TO BE BACK SOON.

09:32.666 --> 09:35.133
>> FLATTERY IS THE MOTHER'S MILK

09:35.200 --> 09:35.566
OF TELEVISION.

09:35.633 --> 09:37.433
>> FLATTERY IS THE MOTHER'S MILK

09:37.500 --> 09:38.433
OF TELEVISION.

09:38.500 --> 09:40.933
DON'T YOU FORGET IT.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.666
FLATTERY IS THE MOTHER'S MILK OF

09:42.733 --> 09:43.366
TELEVISION.

09:43.433 --> 09:44.833
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

09:44.900 --> 09:48.100
FLATTERY IS THE MOTHER'S MILK OF

09:48.166 --> 09:48.733
TELEVISION.

09:48.800 --> 09:49.466
FLATTERY IS THE MOTHER'S MILK OF

09:49.533 --> 09:50.800
TELEVISION.

09:50.866 --> 09:51.700
FLATTERY IS THE MOTHER'S MILK OF

09:51.766 --> 09:53.200
TELEVISION.

09:53.266 --> 09:57.033
THE MOTHER'S MILK OF TELEVISION.

09:57.100 --> 09:57.300
FLATTERY.

09:57.366 --> 09:58.000
FLATTERY IS THE MOTHER'S MILK OF

09:58.066 --> 10:00.600
TELEVISION.

10:00.666 --> 10:01.666
THAT'S VERY GOOD STUFF.

10:01.733 --> 10:04.033
FLATTERY IS THE MOTHER'S MILK.

10:04.100 --> 10:04.733
FLATTERY IS THE MOTHER'S MILK

10:04.800 --> 10:08.833
OF TELEVISION.

10:08.900 --> 10:12.233
>> IT'S TRUE THOUGH.

10:12.300 --> 10:13.266
>> John: MOVING ON.

10:13.333 --> 10:14.133
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

10:14.200 --> 10:15.000
THE FACT THAT SUMMER'S HERE!

10:15.066 --> 10:15.600
IT'S BEEN GETTING HOTTER AND

10:15.666 --> 10:16.233
HOTTER OUTSIDE, SO WE THOUGHT,

10:16.300 --> 10:17.066
"WHY NOT TAKE A BREAK AND HAVE

10:17.133 --> 10:17.666
SOME SUMMER FUN?

10:17.733 --> 10:21.100
WE'RE ALLOWED TO HAVE SOME

10:21.166 --> 10:21.566
SUMMER FUN, RIGHT?"

10:21.633 --> 10:23.466
SO TONIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO TALK

10:23.533 --> 10:23.966
ABOUT POPSICLES.

10:24.033 --> 10:26.366
THERE ARE TONS OF THEM IN

10:26.433 --> 10:28.800
AMERICA,

10:28.866 --> 10:31.366
AND WHEN THEY GET TOO HOT, IT

10:31.433 --> 10:32.133
CAN BE A REAL PROBLEM.

10:32.200 --> 10:32.733
SORRY -- DID I SAY POPSICLES?

10:32.800 --> 10:33.133
I MEANT PRISONS.

10:33.200 --> 10:33.766
WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT

10:33.833 --> 10:34.233
PRISONS.

10:34.300 --> 10:34.833
THERE ARE TONS OF THEM IN

10:34.900 --> 10:35.400
AMERICA.

10:35.466 --> 10:36.266
AND WHEN THEY GET TOO HOT, IT

10:36.333 --> 10:36.966
CAN BE A REAL PROBLEM.

10:37.033 --> 10:37.400
DON'T ACT SURPRISED.

10:37.466 --> 10:38.066
YOU KNEW NO FUN WAS HAPPENING

10:38.133 --> 10:38.400
HERE.

10:38.466 --> 10:39.466
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT OUR

10:39.533 --> 10:40.066
"SUMMER FUN" EPISODE WAS THIS

10:40.133 --> 10:41.066
TIME LAST YEAR?

10:41.133 --> 10:44.433
"VOTING BY MAIL."

10:44.500 --> 10:45.833
DON'T BE MAD AT ME.

10:45.900 --> 10:47.600
BE MAD AT YOURSELF.

10:47.666 --> 10:48.366
YOU CHOSE TO BE HERE.

10:48.433 --> 10:48.966
AND LOOK, THE FACT IS, HEAT IN

10:49.033 --> 10:49.500
PRISONS IS A BIG PROBLEM.

10:49.566 --> 10:50.566
WE'VE TALKED REPEATEDLY ABOUT

10:50.633 --> 10:51.500
THE INJUSTICES OF MASS

10:51.566 --> 10:52.466
INCARCERATION AND HOW LITTLE

10:52.533 --> 10:54.800
SOCIETY SEEMS TO CARE.

10:54.866 --> 10:56.533
AND A PRETTY GOOD EXAMPLE OF

10:56.600 --> 10:58.300
THAT IS THE FACT THAT IN

10:58.366 --> 10:59.733
SOME OF THE HOTTEST AREAS OF THE

10:59.800 --> 11:01.600
COUNTRY -- THESE STATES -- OVER

11:01.666 --> 11:02.500
HALF THE PRISONS LACK

11:02.566 --> 11:03.600
AIR CONDITIONING IN

11:03.666 --> 11:05.133
THEIR HOUSING AREAS.

11:05.200 --> 11:07.600
AND IN TEXAS, THAT'S THE CASE IN

11:07.666 --> 11:12.600
NEARLY 75% OF THEIR PRISONS.

11:12.666 --> 11:13.266
AND THAT IS NOT GOOD, BECAUSE IN

11:13.333 --> 11:14.233
SUMMER, THE HEAT INDEX INSIDE OF

11:14.300 --> 11:16.200
THEM CAN HIT 150 DEGREES.

11:16.266 --> 11:17.633
PLUS, THERE'S A GROWING

11:17.700 --> 11:18.800
POPULATION OF OLDER PRISONERS

11:18.866 --> 11:20.900
WHOSE AGE MAKES THEM MORE

11:20.966 --> 11:23.700
SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE HEAT, AND

11:23.766 --> 11:24.333
OVER 40% OF INCARCERATED PEOPLE

11:24.400 --> 11:25.766
HAVE A CHRONIC MEDICAL

11:25.833 --> 11:27.166
CONDITION, RAISING THEIR RISK OF

11:27.233 --> 11:29.300
HEAT STROKE.

11:29.366 --> 11:30.700
SO A LOT OF THEM WORRY ABOUT

11:30.766 --> 11:31.766
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE WEATHER

11:31.833 --> 11:33.233
TURNS HOT.

11:33.300 --> 11:35.066
>> I HAVE HEART DISEASE, HIGH

11:35.133 --> 11:38.833
BLOOD PRESSURE, DIABETES.

11:38.900 --> 11:39.400
THAT'S THREE CONDITIONS THAT

11:39.466 --> 11:41.566
EVEN TDC ADMITS COULD MAKE A

11:41.633 --> 11:42.633
PERSON SUSCEPTIBLE TO EXTREME

11:42.700 --> 11:44.100
HEAT CONDITIONS.

11:44.166 --> 11:45.266
SO MY HEART HAS TO WORK A

11:45.333 --> 11:46.333
WHOLE LOT HARDER THAN THE

11:46.400 --> 11:47.533
AVERAGE GUY JUST TO TRY TO COOL

11:47.600 --> 11:48.633
MY BODY DOWN.

11:48.700 --> 11:50.200
AND AS A RESULT, I SUFFER FROM

11:50.266 --> 11:51.700
EXTREME CHEST PAINS.

11:51.766 --> 11:52.900
ON DAYS WHERE IT'S EXTREMELY

11:52.966 --> 11:57.200
HOT, I GET SICK REAL FAST.

11:57.266 --> 11:57.866
>> John: THAT IS REMARKABLY

11:57.933 --> 11:58.866
DANGEROUS.

11:58.933 --> 11:59.833
AND I'D ARGUE THAT THE ONLY TIME

11:59.900 --> 12:00.600
GETTING MURDERED BY THE HEAT IS

12:00.666 --> 12:01.733
ACCEPTABLE IS IF YOU'VE

12:01.800 --> 12:02.700
COMMITTED THE CRIME OF BEING A

12:02.766 --> 12:04.700
LOBSTER.

12:04.766 --> 12:07.066
BUT UNLESS YOU HAPPEN TO BE A

12:07.133 --> 12:08.466
TASTY SEA WEIRDO WITH EDIBLE

12:08.533 --> 12:09.833
ARMS AND A PILE OF SCRUMPTIOUS

12:09.900 --> 12:10.933
ASS MEAT THAT PAIRS BEAUTIFULLY

12:11.000 --> 12:16.300
WITH MELTED BUTTER, I'M GONNA

12:16.366 --> 12:17.133
SAY THAT THAT IS VERY WRONG.

12:17.200 --> 12:17.800
AND PHYSICAL CONDITIONS ARE JUST

12:17.866 --> 12:18.366
ONE PART OF THIS.

12:18.433 --> 12:19.966
PRISONS ALSO HOUSE AN INCREASING

12:20.033 --> 12:21.466
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WITH MENTAL

12:21.533 --> 12:22.400
HEALTH CONCERNS WHO REQUIRE

12:22.466 --> 12:23.966
MEDICATIONS THAT CAN COMPROMISE

12:24.033 --> 12:25.566
THEIR BODY'S ABILITY TO REGULATE

12:25.633 --> 12:27.466
TEMPERATURE, SO MANY AVOID

12:27.533 --> 12:30.033
TAKING THEIR MEDICATIONS WHEN

12:30.100 --> 12:31.366
IT'S HOT, WHICH MAY EXPLAIN WHY

12:31.433 --> 12:32.766
THERE IS AN INCREASE IN THE

12:32.833 --> 12:34.266
FREQUENCY OF SUICIDE WATCHES AND

12:34.333 --> 12:35.633
SELF-HARM BEHAVIORS DURING THE

12:35.700 --> 12:38.433
SUMMER MONTHS.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.700
THIS SITUATION IS SO BAD, THE

12:40.766 --> 12:42.433
U.N. COMMITTEE AGAINST TORTURE

12:42.500 --> 12:44.266
HAS EXPRESSED PARTICULAR CONCERN

12:44.333 --> 12:46.233
ABOUT DEATHS FROM EXTREME HEAT

12:46.300 --> 12:47.333
EXPOSURE IN PRISON FACILITIES IN

12:47.400 --> 12:48.833
TEXAS.

12:48.900 --> 12:50.633
AND WHILE YOU PROBABLY ASSUMED

12:50.700 --> 12:52.200
TEXAS PRISONS WERE BAD, MAYBE

12:52.266 --> 12:53.300
NOT "INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS

12:53.366 --> 12:55.066
WATCH LIST" BAD.

12:55.133 --> 12:56.233
AND JUST TO GET THIS OUT OF THE

12:56.300 --> 13:02.033
WAY: IF ANYONE IS THINKING,

13:02.100 --> 13:04.000
"WELL, COME ONE, IT'S PRISON,

13:04.066 --> 13:04.600
THESE CRIMINALS SHOULDN'T BE

13:04.666 --> 13:05.566
COMFORTABLE."

13:05.633 --> 13:07.433
FIRST, FUCK YOU.

13:07.500 --> 13:08.600
THEY'RE HUMAN BEINGS WHO, I'D

13:08.666 --> 13:09.500
ARGUE, DESERVE HUMANE TREATMENT

13:09.566 --> 13:14.500
REGARDLESS OF WHAT THEY DID.

13:14.566 --> 13:15.233
BUT EVEN IF YOU'RE FULLY ON

13:15.300 --> 13:15.900
BOARD WITH OUR CURRENT SYSTEM OF

13:15.966 --> 13:16.633
PUNITIVE JUSTICE ON A RIDICULOUS

13:16.700 --> 13:17.633
SCALE, YOU SHOULD KNOW, EVEN

13:17.700 --> 13:18.933
SOME OF THOSE UPHOLDING THIS

13:19.000 --> 13:20.766
SYSTEM FIND THE CURRENT

13:20.833 --> 13:22.400
SITUATION INDEFENSIBLE.

13:22.466 --> 13:23.600
JUST LISTEN TO THE FORMER HEAD

13:23.666 --> 13:24.466
OF ONE CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS

13:24.533 --> 13:25.500
UNION:

13:25.566 --> 13:26.500
>> YOU KNOW, I DON'T HAVE LOVE

13:26.566 --> 13:28.000
FOR THESE PEOPLE.

13:28.066 --> 13:31.066
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO MAKE THIS

13:31.133 --> 13:32.233
LUSH AND -- WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE

13:32.300 --> 13:34.800
IT HUMANE.

13:34.866 --> 13:35.533
THESE ARE THIRD WORLD

13:35.600 --> 13:36.266
CONDITIONS.

13:36.333 --> 13:36.933
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO RUN PRISONS,

13:37.000 --> 13:38.733
NOT CONCENTRATION CAMPS.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.500
THESE ARE INSTITUTIONS FOR

13:40.566 --> 13:42.233
INCARCERATION.

13:42.300 --> 13:44.933
THE INCARCERATION IS THEIR

13:45.000 --> 13:45.866
PUNISHMENT, NOT -- NOT COOKING

13:45.933 --> 13:47.233
THEM TO DEATH.

13:47.300 --> 13:48.900
>> John: RIGHT.

13:48.966 --> 13:50.366
AND JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO ABSORB

13:50.433 --> 13:51.433
THE SENTENCE, "WE'RE SUPPOSED TO

13:51.500 --> 13:53.800
RUN PRISONS, NOT CONCENTRATION

13:53.866 --> 13:55.033
CAMPS."

13:55.100 --> 13:56.633
IF SOMEONE HELPING TO RUN A

13:56.700 --> 13:57.900
SYSTEM IS COMPARING IT TO A

13:57.966 --> 13:59.366
CONCENTRATION CAMP, THINGS HAVE

13:59.433 --> 14:01.633
GOTTEN WAY OUT OF HAND.

14:01.700 --> 14:02.933
IF SOMEONE SAID, "WE'RE SUPPOSED

14:03.000 --> 14:04.766
TO RUN A QUIZNOS, NOT A

14:04.833 --> 14:06.200
CONCENTRATION CAMP," YOU'D

14:06.266 --> 14:07.433
SERIOUSLY QUESTION WHAT THE FUCK

14:07.500 --> 14:09.933
IS GOING ON AT THAT QUIZNOS.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.200
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT

14:11.266 --> 14:13.066
HEAT IN PRISONS.

14:13.133 --> 14:16.933
AND LET'S START WITH THE OBVIOUS

14:17.000 --> 14:18.400
QUESTION HERE: IF PRISONS ARE

14:18.466 --> 14:20.700
TOO HOT -- WHICH MANY CLEARLY

14:20.766 --> 14:21.433
ARE -- WHY NOT PUT IN

14:21.500 --> 14:22.233
AIR CONDITIONING?

14:22.300 --> 14:24.466
AND THAT DOES SEEM LIKE A PRETTY

14:24.533 --> 14:25.266
EASY FIX.

14:25.333 --> 14:25.966
BUT WHENEVER IT'S BROUGHT UP,

14:26.033 --> 14:26.700
LAWMAKERS AND PRISON OFFICIALS

14:26.766 --> 14:28.200
HAVE CLAIMED THEY SIMPLY CAN'T

14:28.266 --> 14:29.166
AFFORD IT.

14:29.233 --> 14:30.533
ALTHOUGH, WHEN MAKING THAT

14:30.600 --> 14:31.700
ARGUMENT, THEY'VE OCCASIONALLY

14:31.766 --> 14:33.300
BEEN SLIGHTLY MORE HONEST THAN

14:33.366 --> 14:34.933
THEY WERE PERHAPS PLANNING, LIKE

14:35.000 --> 14:36.333
WHEN THIS TEXAS STATE SENATOR

14:36.400 --> 14:38.566
APPEARED ON LOCAL RADIO.

14:38.633 --> 14:40.000
>> YOU KNOW, WE CAN TALK ABOUT

14:40.066 --> 14:41.966
THIS ALL DAY, IT'S NOT GONNA

14:42.033 --> 14:42.900
CHANGE.

14:42.966 --> 14:43.733
THE PRISONS ARE HOT.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.666
THEY'RE UNCOMFORTABLE.

14:45.733 --> 14:47.500
AND THE REAL SOLUTION IS, DON'T

14:47.566 --> 14:48.300
COMMIT A CRIME AND YOU STAY AT

14:48.366 --> 14:49.100
HOME AND BE COOL.

14:49.166 --> 14:49.733
WE'RE NOT GONNA AIR CONDITION

14:49.800 --> 14:50.466
THEM.

14:50.533 --> 14:51.400
ONE, WE DON'T WANT TO.

14:51.466 --> 14:52.700
NUMBER TWO, WE COULDN'T AFFORD

14:52.766 --> 14:55.433
IT IF WE WANTED TO.

14:55.500 --> 14:56.866
>> John: WELL, HOLD ON THERE.

14:56.933 --> 15:01.000
LET'S BACK UP TO NUMBER ONE.

15:01.066 --> 15:01.633
SHALL WE?

15:01.700 --> 15:02.600
"WE DON'T WANT TO."

15:02.666 --> 15:03.600
BECAUSE AFTER YOU SAY THAT, IT

15:03.666 --> 15:05.166
DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT YOU

15:05.233 --> 15:05.966
SAY NEXT.

15:06.033 --> 15:06.833
IF PEOPLE DON'T CARE ABOUT

15:06.900 --> 15:07.733
FIXING A PROBLEM, THEY'RE JUST

15:07.800 --> 15:09.100
NOT GOING TO FIX IT, HOWEVER

15:09.166 --> 15:11.066
SIMPLE THE SOLUTION IS.

15:11.133 --> 15:11.800
IT'S WHY YOUR SOFTWARE UPDATE

15:11.866 --> 15:13.066
STILL INTERRUPTS YOU EVERY

15:13.133 --> 15:14.366
SINGLE DAY.

15:14.433 --> 15:15.600
SURE, YOU COULD JUST CLICK ON

15:15.666 --> 15:16.866
THE ALERT AND FOLLOW THE BASIC

15:16.933 --> 15:17.500
STEPS TO MAKE THE UPDATES.

15:17.566 --> 15:18.333
BUT HAVE YOU DONE THAT?

15:18.400 --> 15:19.333
OF COURSE NOT!

15:19.400 --> 15:20.366
WHY?

15:20.433 --> 15:23.033
BECAUSE YOU COULD NOT GIVE ONE

15:23.100 --> 15:25.266
SINGLE, SOLITARY FUCK.

15:25.333 --> 15:27.166
AND IT SEEMS TEXAS IN PARTICULAR

15:27.233 --> 15:28.566
REALLY DOESN'T WANT TO PUT IN

15:28.633 --> 15:31.000
AIR CONDITIONING.

15:31.066 --> 15:33.266
IT ACTUALLY SPENT $7 MILLION ON

15:33.333 --> 15:35.033
A LAWSUIT TO FIGHT INSTALLING AC

15:35.100 --> 15:36.433
IN ONE PRISON'S HOUSING AREA,

15:36.500 --> 15:38.700
DESPITE THE FACT THE ESTIMATED

15:38.766 --> 15:40.766
COST OF INSTALLATION WAS ONLY

15:40.833 --> 15:42.000
AROUND $4 MILLION.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.866
AND THEY'VE ALSO THROWN SOME

15:43.933 --> 15:45.833
SUSPICIOUSLY HIGH ESTIMATES

15:45.900 --> 15:47.133
AROUND.

15:47.200 --> 15:48.933
THEY ONCE CLAIMED IT WOULD COST

15:49.000 --> 15:50.333
$109 MILLION TO INSTALL AC IN A

15:50.400 --> 15:51.533
UNIT FOR DEVELOPMENTALLY

15:51.600 --> 15:53.033
DISABLED PRISONERS, EVEN THOUGH

15:53.100 --> 15:55.000
THE ENTIRE HOUSING UNIT COST

15:55.066 --> 15:57.333
JUST $26 MILLION TO BUILD.

15:57.400 --> 15:59.600
AND LOOK, I ADMIT, I DON'T KNOW

15:59.666 --> 16:01.066
MUCH ABOUT AC INSTALLATION.

16:01.133 --> 16:02.500
IF YOU POINTED AT A RANDOM

16:02.566 --> 16:04.166
BUILDING AND SAID, "IT COST

16:04.233 --> 16:05.866
$10,000 TO INSTALL AC IN THERE,"

16:05.933 --> 16:07.066
I'D SAY, "OKAY, SURE," AND IF

16:07.133 --> 16:08.766
YOU POINTED AT ANOTHER ONE AND

16:08.833 --> 16:09.500
SAID, "IT COST $3 MILLION TO

16:09.566 --> 16:12.966
INSTALL IT IN THERE," I WOULD

16:13.033 --> 16:13.500
SAY, "YEAH, MAKES SENSE."

16:13.566 --> 16:14.633
BUT IF YOU POINTED AT A BUILDING

16:14.700 --> 16:16.100
AND SAID, "IT COST FOUR TIMES

16:16.166 --> 16:17.266
THE PRICE OF THAT BUILDING TO

16:17.333 --> 16:19.166
INSTALL AC IN IT," I'D SAY, "I

16:19.233 --> 16:20.300
THINK YOU SOMEHOW KNOW LESS

16:20.366 --> 16:22.000
ABOUT AIR CONDITIONING THAN I

16:22.066 --> 16:23.633
DO."

16:23.700 --> 16:25.200
AND THAT "TOO EXPENSIVE"

16:25.266 --> 16:27.166
ARGUMENT GETS EVEN HARDER TO

16:27.233 --> 16:28.533
TAKE WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT, IN

16:28.600 --> 16:29.766
SOME PRISONS, THERE IS CLIMATE

16:29.833 --> 16:31.100
CONTROL, JUST NOT FOR THE

16:31.166 --> 16:32.500
PRISONERS.

16:32.566 --> 16:33.933
BECAUSE SOME HAVE AC IN STAFF

16:34.000 --> 16:35.333
OFFICES.

16:35.400 --> 16:37.133
AND THEN THERE'S THIS:

16:37.200 --> 16:38.566
>> TWO YEARS AGO, PRISON

16:38.633 --> 16:40.066
OFFICIALS SPENT MORE THAN

16:40.133 --> 16:41.433
$700,000 ON NEW

16:41.500 --> 16:43.066
CLIMATE-CONTROLLED HOUSING

16:43.133 --> 16:45.166
FACILITIES.

16:45.233 --> 16:49.900
FOR PRISONERS, NO.

16:49.966 --> 16:50.600
FOR THE PRISONS' IN-HOUSE PIG

16:50.666 --> 16:51.266
FARMS.

16:51.333 --> 16:52.100
OFFICIALS SAY THE COOLING

16:52.166 --> 16:53.266
SYSTEMS ARE, "CONSISTENT WITH

16:53.333 --> 16:54.733
ANY SWINE OPERATION."

16:54.800 --> 16:56.366
>> John: LOOK, I'M NOT AGAINST

16:56.433 --> 16:57.566
PIGS GETTING TREATED

16:57.633 --> 16:59.200
COMFORTABLY.

16:59.266 --> 17:01.066
I LOVE PIGS -- THEIR SPRINGY

17:01.133 --> 17:03.333
TAILS, THEIR TOO-BIG EARS, THEIR

17:03.400 --> 17:04.533
STUPID FLAT NOSES, AND THEIR

17:04.600 --> 17:05.800
HORRIBLE EYES -- PIGS ARE LIKE

17:05.866 --> 17:06.666
BIG CHUBBY DOGS YOU CAN EAT AT

17:06.733 --> 17:08.600
CHRISTMAS.

17:08.666 --> 17:09.866
I JUST QUESTION PRIORITIZING

17:09.933 --> 17:11.533
THEIR COMFORT OVER HUMANS'.

17:11.600 --> 17:13.133
AND THE THING IS, CORRECTIONS

17:13.200 --> 17:15.266
SYSTEMS DO SEEM TO ACKNOWLEDGE

17:15.333 --> 17:17.266
THAT THEY DO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH

17:17.333 --> 17:18.766
HEAT -- IT'S JUST, THEY OFTEN

17:18.833 --> 17:19.800
TRY TO TREAT IT WITH RIDICULOUS

17:19.866 --> 17:21.966
HALF-MEASURES.

17:22.033 --> 17:23.633
THE TEXAS PRISON SYSTEM EVEN

17:23.700 --> 17:24.700
PRODUCED THIS VIDEO ON WHAT

17:24.766 --> 17:25.966
STAFF SHOULD DO WHEN THEY SEE

17:26.033 --> 17:27.166
SOMEONE ABOUT TO PASS OUT FROM

17:27.233 --> 17:28.866
HEAT EXHAUSTION.

17:28.933 --> 17:30.300
>> IF CONSCIOUS AND ALERT, HAVE

17:30.366 --> 17:31.333
THE PERSON DRINK WATER OR A

17:31.400 --> 17:33.966
REHYDRATING SPORTS DRINK.

17:34.033 --> 17:35.233
DO NOT GIVE THEM CAFFEINATED

17:35.300 --> 17:36.466
DRINKS AS THESE WILL CONTRIBUTE

17:36.533 --> 17:40.133
TO FURTHER DEHYDRATION.

17:40.200 --> 17:42.033
SPRINKLE OR SPRAY THEM WITH

17:42.100 --> 17:43.766
WATER AND APPLY COOL WATER OR

17:43.833 --> 17:45.700
WET CLOTHS TO THE PERSON'S NECK,

17:45.766 --> 17:47.800
ARMPITS, AND GROIN.

17:47.866 --> 17:49.066
FAN THE PERSON IF THERE IS NO

17:49.133 --> 17:50.300
BREEZE.

17:50.366 --> 17:52.300
>> John: OKAY.

17:52.366 --> 17:53.666
FLICKING WATER IN THEIR FACE AND

17:53.733 --> 17:54.866
FANNING THEM WITH A CLIPBOARD IS

17:54.933 --> 17:56.366
JUST NOT GOING TO CUT IT.

17:56.433 --> 17:58.833
AND AT THAT POINT, IT MAKES JUST

17:58.900 --> 18:01.033
AS MUCH SENSE TO RECOMMEND,

18:01.100 --> 18:03.666
"LICK THE PERSON'S SWEAT OFF

18:03.733 --> 18:07.833
THEIR FOREHEAD," OR "RUB THEM

18:07.900 --> 18:09.500
WITH A DVD OF

18:09.566 --> 18:10.566
'CAPTAIN PHILLIPS.'"

18:10.633 --> 18:11.433
SURE, IT'S TECHNICALLY A

18:11.500 --> 18:12.666
GESTURE, BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO

18:12.733 --> 18:13.466
DO MUCH.

18:13.533 --> 18:14.533
THE PROBLEM IS, WHEN PRISONS USE

18:14.600 --> 18:15.400
THINGS LIKE LARGE FANS AND WATER

18:15.466 --> 18:16.266
MISTERS, THEY ONLY HELP TO A

18:16.333 --> 18:17.666
CERTAIN THRESHOLD OF HEAT.

18:17.733 --> 18:19.066
BEYOND IT, THEY CAN ACTUALLY

18:19.133 --> 18:20.500
MAKE THINGS WORSE.

18:20.566 --> 18:22.800
WATER MISTERS INCREASE HUMIDITY,

18:22.866 --> 18:24.933
AND THE CDC HAS EXPLICITLY SAID

18:25.000 --> 18:26.466
IT DOES NOT RECOMMEND THE USE OF

18:26.533 --> 18:28.966
FANS ABOVE A 95-DEGREE HEAT

18:29.033 --> 18:31.166
INDEX, AS THEY ACTUALLY INCREASE

18:31.233 --> 18:32.933
HEAT STRESS BY BLOWING AIR THAT

18:33.000 --> 18:34.300
IS WARMER THAN THE BODY'S

18:34.366 --> 18:36.200
TEMPERATURE.

18:36.266 --> 18:37.200
AND DANGEROUS SITUATIONS GET

18:37.266 --> 18:38.800
COMPOUNDED BY THE FACT THAT WHEN

18:38.866 --> 18:40.566
HEAT-RELATED ISSUES OCCUR,

18:40.633 --> 18:42.300
PRISONS CAN SHOW VERY LITTLE

18:42.366 --> 18:43.900
URGENCY IN ADDRESSING THEM.

18:43.966 --> 18:45.100
TAKE WHAT HAPPENED TO

18:45.166 --> 18:46.766
LARRY McCOLLUM.

18:46.833 --> 18:48.966
HE WAS SERVING AN 11-MONTH

18:49.033 --> 18:50.766
SENTENCE FOR CASHING A BAD CHECK

18:50.833 --> 18:52.533
AND BEGAN SHOWING SYMPTOMS OF

18:52.600 --> 18:56.300
HEAT STROKE, BUT EMS WASN'T

18:56.366 --> 18:58.700
CALLED UNTIL OVER 40 MINUTES

18:58.766 --> 19:03.266
AFTER HE WAS FOUND CONVULSING.

19:03.333 --> 19:04.000
WHEN McCOLLUM FINALLY ARRIVED AT

19:04.066 --> 19:05.000
THE HOSPITAL, HIS BODY

19:05.066 --> 19:06.233
TEMPERATURE WAS 109 DEGREES.

19:06.300 --> 19:07.866
AND HE DIED DAYS LATER.

19:07.933 --> 19:09.500
AND WHEN THAT PRISON'S WARDEN

19:09.566 --> 19:11.200
WAS QUESTIONED ABOUT THE DELAY

19:11.266 --> 19:12.466
IN MEDICAL TREATMENT, THIS WAS

19:12.533 --> 19:15.600
HIS RIDICULOUS RESPONSE.

19:15.666 --> 19:16.666
>> IF YOU RE AT HOME AND YOUR

19:16.733 --> 19:18.333
WIFE WAS HAVING A HEART ATTACK

19:18.400 --> 19:19.566
AND YOU CALLED 911 AND IT TOOK A

19:19.633 --> 19:20.966
HALF HOUR FOR THEM TO ARRIVE,

19:21.033 --> 19:21.866
WOULD YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH

19:21.933 --> 19:23.966
THAT?

19:24.033 --> 19:25.266
>> THAT'S SPECULATING.

19:25.333 --> 19:26.200
I DON'T KNOW -- I WOULDN'T KNOW

19:26.266 --> 19:26.766
IF SHE HAD A HEART ATTACK OR

19:26.833 --> 19:29.033
NOT.

19:29.100 --> 19:30.300
>> OKAY.

19:30.366 --> 19:30.866
I WOULD HAVE A PROBLEM WITH

19:30.933 --> 19:33.300
THAT, JUST LETTING YOU KNOW.

19:33.366 --> 19:35.000
OKAY?

19:35.066 --> 19:36.466
IF MY WIFE WAS HAVING A HEART

19:36.533 --> 19:38.133
ATTACK AND I CALLED 911 AND IT

19:38.200 --> 19:39.466
TOOK A HALF HOUR FOR AN

19:39.533 --> 19:42.833
AMBULANCE TO ARRIVE.

19:42.900 --> 19:44.733
YOU DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE

19:44.800 --> 19:46.266
SAYING THAT YOU TOO WOULD HAVE

19:46.333 --> 19:49.266
AN ISSUE WITH THAT?

19:49.333 --> 19:50.466
>> I WOULD NOT.

19:50.533 --> 19:51.366
I WOULD HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

19:51.433 --> 19:52.400
WHETHER IT'S A HEART ATTACK OR

19:52.466 --> 19:53.433
NOT.

19:53.500 --> 19:55.233
>> OKAY.

19:55.300 --> 19:56.300
>> COULD BE JUST BAD CHILI.

19:56.366 --> 19:57.333
>> John: WHAT THE FUCK?

19:57.400 --> 19:58.700
FIRST, NO ONE WOULD EVER CONFUSE

19:58.766 --> 19:59.733
SOMEONE HAVING VIOLENT

19:59.800 --> 20:00.933
CONVULSIONS WITH HAVING BAD

20:01.000 --> 20:02.433
CHILI.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.200
SECOND, BAD CHILI HAS A NAME,

20:04.266 --> 20:05.200
AND IT'S CALLED HORMEL.

20:05.266 --> 20:06.366
SHOW SOME RESPECT TO THAT CAN OF

20:06.433 --> 20:08.866
BEAN NIGHTMARES.

20:08.933 --> 20:09.933
AND FINALLY, GUESSING YOUR

20:10.000 --> 20:11.233
WIFE'S HEART ATTACK MIGHT BE

20:11.300 --> 20:12.533
JUST "BAD CHILI" IS A TERRIBLE

20:12.600 --> 20:14.533
ANSWER, NOT ONLY BECAUSE THAT'S

20:14.600 --> 20:16.900
NOT HOW HEART ATTACKS WORK, IT'S

20:16.966 --> 20:18.700
ALSO NOT HOW HYPOTHETICALS WORK.

20:18.766 --> 20:20.366
IN THIS SCENARIO, YOUR WIFE IS

20:20.433 --> 20:22.166
HAVING A HEART ATTACK.

20:22.233 --> 20:23.133
YOU CAN'T JUST IGNORE THE

20:23.200 --> 20:24.500
PREMISE.

20:24.566 --> 20:26.266
IF SOMEONE ASKS, "IF YOU COULD

20:26.333 --> 20:28.900
HAVE DINNER WITH ANYONE, LIVING

20:28.966 --> 20:29.800
OR DEAD, WHO WOULD YOU CHOOSE,"

20:29.866 --> 20:30.433
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO SAY, "NO,

20:30.500 --> 20:32.566
THANKS, I ALREADY ATE."

20:32.633 --> 20:33.666
THAT'S NOT THE POINT OF THE

20:33.733 --> 20:35.600
QUESTION.

20:35.666 --> 20:39.666
AND AMAZINGLY, AS BAD AS THAT

20:39.733 --> 20:40.566
RESPONSE WAS, IT WASN'T EVEN THE

20:40.633 --> 20:41.700
WORST MOMENT IN HIS DEPOSITION,

20:41.766 --> 20:42.800
BECAUSE MONTHS LATER, HE WAS

20:42.866 --> 20:44.133
ASKED ABOUT HOW THE POPULATION

20:44.200 --> 20:46.333
OF HIS PRISON MIGHT BE MORE

20:46.400 --> 20:46.900
SUSCEPTIBLE TO HEAT-RELATED

20:46.966 --> 20:47.533
ILLNESS.

20:47.600 --> 20:48.733
AND JUST WATCH THIS INFURIATING

20:48.800 --> 20:50.333
EXCHANGE.

20:50.400 --> 20:51.266
>> DO YOU SUSPECT THAT SOME OF

20:51.333 --> 20:52.500
THE PEOPLE WHO COME INTO YOUR

20:52.566 --> 20:53.166
FACILITY ARE GOING TO HAVE

20:53.233 --> 20:53.933
HYPERTENSION?

20:54.000 --> 20:55.366
>> I DO NOT KNOW.

20:55.433 --> 20:56.266
>> DO YOU SUSPECT THAT SOME OF

20:56.333 --> 20:57.233
THE PEOPLE WHO COME INTO YOUR

20:57.300 --> 20:58.266
FACILITY ARE GOING TO BE, I

20:58.333 --> 20:59.266
DON'T KNOW, OLDER THAN 60?

20:59.333 --> 21:01.366
>> I DO NOT KNOW.

21:01.433 --> 21:02.500
>> DO YOU SUSPECT THAT SOME OF

21:02.566 --> 21:03.366
THE PEOPLE WHO COME INTO YOUR

21:03.433 --> 21:04.800
FACILITY ARE GOING TO BE OLDER

21:04.866 --> 21:05.900
THAN 40?

21:05.966 --> 21:07.600
>> I DO NOT KNOW.

21:07.666 --> 21:08.666
>> DO YOU SUSPECT THAT SOME OF

21:08.733 --> 21:09.633
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO

21:09.700 --> 21:11.300
COME INTO YOUR FACILITY ARE

21:11.366 --> 21:11.966
GOING TO BE ON PSYCHOTROPIC

21:12.033 --> 21:13.300
MEDICATIONS?

21:13.366 --> 21:14.833
>> I DO NOT KNOW.

21:14.900 --> 21:16.366
>> WOULDN'T ANY COMPETENT

21:16.433 --> 21:20.833
SUPERVISOR, SHOULDN'T HE OR SHE

21:20.900 --> 21:22.200
KNOW THE ANSWERS TO THOSE

21:22.266 --> 21:23.366
QUESTIONS?

21:23.433 --> 21:25.000
>> I DO NOT KNOW.

21:25.066 --> 21:25.966
>> John: OKAY, WE GET IT.

21:26.033 --> 21:27.533
YOU DON'T KNOW A LOT OF THINGS.

21:27.600 --> 21:28.700
I ALMOST WISH THAT LINE OF

21:28.766 --> 21:30.033
QUESTIONING HAD CONTINUED.

21:30.100 --> 21:31.000
"DO YOU SUSPECT THAT SOME OF THE

21:31.066 --> 21:31.666
PEOPLE WHO COME INTO YOUR

21:31.733 --> 21:32.700
FACILITY ARE FIRE MUTANTS

21:32.766 --> 21:33.466
POWERED BY HEAT?"

21:33.533 --> 21:34.433
"I DO NOT KNOW."

21:34.500 --> 21:35.466
"DO YOU HAVE A TATTOO OF PEPPA

21:35.533 --> 21:36.533
PIG ON YOUR LOWER BACK?"

21:36.600 --> 21:37.400
"I DO NOT KNOW."

21:37.466 --> 21:38.466
"IF YOU WERE SURE NO ONE WOULD

21:38.533 --> 21:39.566
EVER FIND OUT, WOULD YOU HAVE

21:39.633 --> 21:40.700
CONSENSUAL SEX WITH A DOLPHIN?"

21:40.766 --> 21:41.500
"I DO NOT KNOW."

21:41.566 --> 21:43.100
"WOULD YOU HIT BRUCE WILLIS WITH

21:43.166 --> 21:43.633
YOUR CAR IF GIVEN THE

21:43.700 --> 21:44.733
OPPORTUNITY?"

21:44.800 --> 21:45.500
"I DO NOT KNOW."

21:45.566 --> 21:46.666
"WHY DO YOU THINK RESPONDING

21:46.733 --> 21:47.500
WITH 'I DO NOT KNOW' TO EVERY

21:47.566 --> 21:48.800
QUESTION ASKED OF A PERSON MAKES

21:48.866 --> 21:49.400
THEM SOUND LIKE A TOTAL

21:49.466 --> 21:50.733
DIPSHIT?"

21:50.800 --> 21:55.433
"I DO NOT KNOW."

21:55.500 --> 21:56.066
SO, LOOK, WHEN YOU PUT ALL THIS

21:56.133 --> 21:57.000
TOGETHER, PRISONERS IN THIS

21:57.066 --> 21:58.066
COUNTRY ARE DESPERATELY

21:58.133 --> 21:58.866
UNCOMFORTABLE, AND SOMETIMES

21:58.933 --> 22:00.166
DYING, DUE TO THE HEAT, AND NO

22:00.233 --> 22:00.766
ONE SEEMS TO GIVE ENOUGH OF A

22:00.833 --> 22:02.200
SHIT TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

22:02.266 --> 22:04.100
AND WHILE A LOT OF THE

22:04.166 --> 22:05.000
FACILITIES I'VE SHOWN YOU

22:05.066 --> 22:06.500
TONIGHT HAVE BEEN IN TEXAS,

22:06.566 --> 22:07.233
THAT'S NOT BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY

22:07.300 --> 22:08.266
CULPRIT.

22:08.333 --> 22:09.366
IT'S JUST ONE OF THE ONLY STATES

22:09.433 --> 22:10.833
WHERE THIS STORY HAS BEEN

22:10.900 --> 22:12.933
EXTENSIVELY REPORTED ON CAMERA.

22:13.000 --> 22:13.600
BUT YOU CAN FIND ACCOUNTS OF

22:13.666 --> 22:17.533
SIMILAR PROBLEMS IN LOUISIANA

22:17.600 --> 22:20.300
AND ALABAMA AND FLORIDA AND

22:20.366 --> 22:22.633
VIRGINIA AND MICHIGAN.

22:22.700 --> 22:24.233
THIS IS A DEADLY SITUATION, AND

22:24.300 --> 22:26.200
IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE,

22:26.266 --> 22:27.066
ESPECIALLY AS SUMMERS ARE

22:27.133 --> 22:28.400
GETTING HOTTER AND HOTTER.

22:28.466 --> 22:29.766
AND WHILE THIS IS CLEARLY JUST

22:29.833 --> 22:31.266
ONE SMALL PART OF A MUCH LARGER

22:31.333 --> 22:32.266
DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER AND HOW

22:32.333 --> 22:33.733
PRISONS SHOULD EXIST IN THIS

22:33.800 --> 22:35.866
COUNTRY, UNTIL SUCH TIME AS WE

22:35.933 --> 22:37.166
HAVE THAT DISCUSSION, THERE IS

22:37.233 --> 22:38.900
ACTUALLY AN EASY SOLUTION TO

22:38.966 --> 22:40.933
THIS ONE PROBLEM, AND THAT IS,

22:41.000 --> 22:42.666
PRISONS NEED AIR CONDITIONING.

22:42.733 --> 22:44.733
SO PUT AIR CONDITIONING IN.

22:44.800 --> 22:46.566
THAT'S IT.

22:46.633 --> 22:47.733
I KNOW THIS SHOW HAS TRAINED YOU

22:47.800 --> 22:48.666
TO ANTICIPATE NUANCE, BUT THIS

22:48.733 --> 22:51.300
ONE'S PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD.

22:51.366 --> 22:52.033
WE SHOULDN'T BE COOKING

22:52.100 --> 22:53.133
PRISONERS TO DEATH.

22:53.200 --> 22:56.500
THE END.

22:56.566 --> 22:57.900
THAT'S JUST NOT SOMETHING WE

22:57.966 --> 22:58.600
SHOULD BE ALLOWING UNDER ANY

22:58.666 --> 22:59.300
CIRCUMSTANCES.

22:59.366 --> 23:00.333
BECAUSE LOCKING HUMAN BEINGS IN

23:00.400 --> 23:02.300
ROOMS WITH A HEAT INDEX OF 150

23:02.366 --> 23:04.333
DEGREES BEGS THE QUESTION, "HOW

23:04.400 --> 23:06.766
ON EARTH COULD ANYONE, ANYWHERE,

23:06.833 --> 23:09.500
THINK IT'S OKAY TO DO THAT?"

23:09.566 --> 23:11.566
AND TO BORROW THE GO-TO ANSWER

23:11.633 --> 23:12.833
OF AN EXTREMELY WEIRD, EXTREMELY

23:12.900 --> 23:14.933
CRUEL MAN: "I DO NOT KNOW."

23:15.000 --> 23:20.800
AND NOW THIS.

23:20.866 --> 23:24.100
>> Announcer: AND NOW, AND NOW

23:24.166 --> 23:25.000
NOW, "LAST WEEK TONIGHT" LEFT

FOX 51 YEAR AGO THIS WEEK, AND

23:27.300 --> 23:29.233
WE MISS HIS MAN ON THE STREET

23:29.300 --> 23:31.833
SEGMENTS NOW MORE THAN EVER.

23:31.900 --> 23:33.266
>> HERE'S MY QUESTION.

23:33.333 --> 23:35.500
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE WAY TO

23:35.566 --> 23:36.266
WATCH TV?

23:36.333 --> 23:38.266
>> IN MY BED.

23:38.333 --> 23:38.600
>> RELAXING.

23:38.666 --> 23:40.000
>> IN A RECLINER.

23:40.066 --> 23:42.833
>> IN A RECLINER.

23:42.900 --> 23:43.600
YOU HAVE ONE?

23:43.666 --> 23:45.800
WHERE IS THE WORST PLACE YOU'VE

23:45.866 --> 23:47.233
EVER BEEN STUCK?

23:47.300 --> 23:48.266
>> X-RAY MACHINE.

23:48.333 --> 23:50.233
>> IN AN X-RAY MACHINE.

23:50.300 --> 23:52.800
WHAT CONSISTENCY DO YOU LIKE

23:52.866 --> 23:53.466
YOUR MILK SHAKE?

23:53.533 --> 23:54.233
>> THICK.

23:54.300 --> 23:55.466
>> THICK.

23:55.533 --> 23:57.033
DO YOU HAVE A LOT OF BABY

23:57.100 --> 23:58.500
PICTURES OF YOURSELF?

23:58.566 --> 24:00.433
HOW DO YOU HANDLE PEOPLE WHO

24:00.500 --> 24:00.866
ANNOY YOU?

24:00.933 --> 24:01.866
CAN YOU SPELL CARIBBEAN?

24:01.933 --> 24:03.866
DO YOU KNOW WHO YOUR NEIGHBORS

24:03.933 --> 24:04.033
ARE?

24:04.100 --> 24:07.266
>> I'M LIVING WITH YOUR MY

24:07.333 --> 24:07.533
NEIGHBORS.

24:07.600 --> 24:08.633
>> GOOD FOR YOU.

24:08.700 --> 24:09.833
TELL ME ABOUT THAT.

24:09.900 --> 24:11.966
IS THERE A NICKNAME YOU WISH YOU

24:12.033 --> 24:12.866
HAD.

24:12.933 --> 24:13.766
>> SWIFTIE.

24:13.833 --> 24:15.500
>> IF YOU'RE WATCHING A SHOW

24:15.566 --> 24:18.100
ABOUT FOOD, DOES IT MAKE YOU

24:18.166 --> 24:18.333
HUNGRY?

24:18.400 --> 24:18.833
>> YES.

24:18.900 --> 24:21.333
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK TASTES

24:21.400 --> 24:22.466
GOOD, BUT IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT

24:22.533 --> 24:24.366
OR MESSY TO EAT.

24:24.433 --> 24:24.766
>> PASTA.

24:24.833 --> 24:26.800
I'M SLOPPY WITH SPAGHETTI AND

24:26.866 --> 24:27.066
MEATBALLS.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.700
>> THAT'S A POPULAR ONE.

24:29.766 --> 24:31.966
>> ALL OVER MY SHIRT.

24:32.033 --> 24:33.600
SPEAKER OF THE TOMATO SAUCE AND

24:33.666 --> 24:34.566
EVERYTHING.

24:34.633 --> 24:36.433
TASTES GOOD, DOESN'T IT?

24:36.500 --> 24:38.800
GREAT, GREAT, GREAT.

24:38.866 --> 24:41.266
THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS

24:41.333 --> 24:41.533
THE SOUP.

24:41.600 --> 24:45.966
>> THAT CAN BE SLOPPY.

24:46.033 --> 24:46.733
>> John: MOVING ON.

24:46.800 --> 24:47.666
BEFORE WE GO, I WANTED TO TAKE A

24:47.733 --> 24:48.300
MOMENT TO DISCUSS COMMERCIALS.

24:48.366 --> 24:48.900
YOU KNOW, THE THING YOU

24:48.966 --> 24:49.566
SUBSCRIBE TO HBO TO AVOID

24:49.633 --> 24:50.400
SEEING.

24:50.466 --> 24:51.833
SPECIFICALLY, I'D LIKE TO TALK

24:51.900 --> 24:52.966
ABOUT ADS FOR LOCAL CAR

24:53.033 --> 24:54.500
DEALERSHIPS, BECAUSE THEY CAN BE

24:54.566 --> 24:55.500
ABSOLUTE WORKS OF ART, LIKE THIS

24:55.566 --> 24:58.300
ONE:

24:58.366 --> 25:00.000
>> HEY, Y'ALL, IT'S BRYCE

25:03.666 --> 25:04.866
ARKANSAS, WHITE COUNTY.

25:04.933 --> 25:06.400
THEY PAID ME TO BE HERE.

25:06.466 --> 25:07.500
THESE AIN'T MY CARS AND I DON'T

25:07.566 --> 25:09.000
REALLY CARE ABOUT THEM.

25:09.066 --> 25:11.933
♪ ♪

25:12.000 --> 25:13.300
WHEN I RIPPED MY TESTICLES OPEN

25:13.366 --> 25:14.833
WITH A DRILL, I HAD TO DRIVE

25:14.900 --> 25:16.500
MYSELF TO THE HOSPITAL IN MY

25:16.566 --> 25:18.233
PICKUP TRUCK.

25:18.300 --> 25:19.400
I REALLY WISH I WOULDA HAD THIS

25:19.466 --> 25:20.433
CORVETTE.

25:20.500 --> 25:21.333
I WOULDA MADE IT ON TIME.

25:21.400 --> 25:24.366
[TIRES SCREECH]

25:24.433 --> 25:26.433
>> John: WOW.

25:26.500 --> 25:28.100
THAT COMMERCIAL RAISES A

25:28.166 --> 25:32.000
THOUSAND QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

25:32.066 --> 25:32.766
EXACTLY NONE OF THEM.

25:32.833 --> 25:33.433
HOW DID THUG NASTY RIP HIS

25:33.500 --> 25:34.466
TESTICLES OPEN WITH A DRILL?

25:34.533 --> 25:35.133
WHY DID HE HAVE A DRILL NEAR HIS

25:35.200 --> 25:36.266
TESTICLES IN THE FIRST PLACE?

25:36.333 --> 25:37.266
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, WHAT DOES

25:37.333 --> 25:38.200
HE MEAN, HE "DIDN'T MAKE IT TO

25:38.266 --> 25:40.000
THE HOSPITAL ON TIME"?

25:40.066 --> 25:41.033
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

25:41.100 --> 25:42.300
I DON'T WANT OR NEED ANY MORE

25:42.366 --> 25:43.000
CONTEXT.

25:43.066 --> 25:45.600
THE BEAUTY IS IN THE MYSTERY.

25:45.666 --> 25:46.566
THE MYSTERY OF BRYCE'S

25:46.633 --> 25:49.133
SELF-DRILLED SCROTUM.

25:49.200 --> 25:51.300
THE POINT IS, THERE'S A REAL

25:51.366 --> 25:52.700
CHARM IN THE ECCENTRICITY OF CAR

25:52.766 --> 25:56.033
DEALERSHIP ADS, BECAUSE THEY CAN

25:56.100 --> 25:56.933
BE A TOTAL LAW UNTO

25:57.000 --> 25:57.366
THEMSELVES.

25:57.433 --> 25:58.266
BUT RECENTLY WE DISCOVERED

25:58.333 --> 25:59.033
SOMETHING SURPRISING.

25:59.100 --> 25:59.833
AND IT ALL STARTED WITH THIS

25:59.900 --> 26:03.266
COMMERCIAL:

26:03.333 --> 26:04.266
>> I'M IN A PICKLE!

26:04.333 --> 26:06.000
MY DOCTOR TOLD ME TO CALM DOWN

26:06.066 --> 26:07.666
BEFORE MY HEART EXPLODES!

26:07.733 --> 26:09.100
THE ONLY WAY FOR ME TO CALM DOWN

26:09.166 --> 26:10.733
IS TO HELP YOU GET A NICER,

26:10.800 --> 26:12.433
NEWER CAR.

26:12.500 --> 26:13.833
>> John: OKAY.

26:13.900 --> 26:17.000
I DON'T MIND THAT.

26:17.066 --> 26:17.600
A GUY DRESSED AS A PICKLE NEXT

26:17.666 --> 26:18.833
TO AN UNCLE SAM WHO LOOKS LIKE

26:18.900 --> 26:19.566
MARK CUBAN SEEMING TO THREATEN

26:19.633 --> 26:20.433
THAT IF YOU DON'T BUY A CAR FROM

26:20.500 --> 26:23.400
HIM, HE'S GOING TO DIE.

26:23.466 --> 26:24.100
I ACTUALLY LIKE IT.

26:24.166 --> 26:25.100
THAT'S SOME FUN LOCAL WEIRDNESS

26:27.500 --> 26:28.500
TO GET ANYWHERE ELSE, RIGHT?

26:28.566 --> 26:29.600
WELL, IT TURNS OUT, WRONG.

26:29.666 --> 26:31.900
BECAUSE WATCH THIS:

27:06.100 --> 27:07.233
USUALLY WHEN YOU SEE THAT MANY

27:07.300 --> 27:09.133

"RICK AND MORTY" QUOTES AT ANY

27:12.500 --> 27:13.566
WOMAN IN THEIR IMMEDIATE

27:13.633 --> 27:14.200
VICINITY AND COMPLETELY RUINING

27:14.266 --> 27:14.533

27:14.600 --> 27:15.966
IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHAT IS

27:16.033 --> 27:16.966
GOING ON THERE, AS BEST WE CAN

27:17.033 --> 27:17.733
TELL, ALL THOSE DEALERSHIPS HAVE

27:17.800 --> 27:20.333
WORKED WITH A MARKETING FIRM

27:20.400 --> 27:21.333
CALLED GRAVITATIONAL MARKETING,

27:21.400 --> 27:23.133
BASED -- OBVIOUSLY -- IN

27:23.200 --> 27:24.233
FLORIDA, WHICH SEEMS TO CHURN

27:24.300 --> 27:25.566
OUT SCRIPTS FOR A BUNCH OF LOCAL

27:25.633 --> 27:27.266
CAR DEALERS, EXPLAINING WHY YOU

27:27.333 --> 27:29.033
CAN FIND SO MANY ADS IN

27:29.100 --> 27:29.900
DIFFERENT PLACES THAT ARE

27:29.966 --> 27:32.966
BASICALLY EXACTLY THE SAME.

27:33.033 --> 27:35.100
WE FOUND MULTIPLE HULK HOGANS IN

27:35.166 --> 27:36.600
EERILY SIMILAR WRESTLING-THEMED

27:36.666 --> 27:39.100
ADS AND MULTIPLE BUNNIES IN

27:39.166 --> 27:43.300
IDENTICAL EASTER COMMERCIALS AND

27:43.366 --> 27:44.200
THEN WE FOUND WHATEVER THE FUCK

27:44.266 --> 27:44.633
THIS IS:

27:44.700 --> 27:45.200
>> IT'S JOHN HERE FROM BLUE

27:45.266 --> 27:45.766

27:45.833 --> 27:46.500

27:47.233 --> 27:48.200
>> HEY, IT'S MIKE GUIZAR, AND

IN THE DOGHOUSE.

27:52.666 --> 27:53.833
I NEED CARS!

27:53.900 --> 27:55.300
>> WE'RE IN THE DOGHOUSE AND WE

27:55.366 --> 27:56.966
NEED CARS!

27:57.033 --> 27:59.066
>> John: WHAT IS THAT?

27:59.133 --> 28:00.500
WHAT'S THE CONCEPT THERE?

28:00.566 --> 28:02.000
DO THESE CAR DEALERS REALLY

28:02.066 --> 28:03.900
THINK THAT SCRIPTS THAT BAD ARE

28:03.966 --> 28:04.666
WORTH OUTSOURCING?

28:04.733 --> 28:06.033
"WE'RE IN THE DOGHOUSE AND WE

28:06.100 --> 28:07.233
NEED CARS"?

28:07.300 --> 28:08.866
DON DRAPER WOULD PUT HIS

28:08.933 --> 28:10.600
CIGARETTE OUT ON YOUR FOREHEAD

28:10.666 --> 28:11.833
IF YOU PITCHED A LINE LIKE THAT.

28:11.900 --> 28:13.166
BUT I WILL SAY, ONCE YOU START

28:13.233 --> 28:15.066
GOING DOWN THIS RABBIT HOLE,

28:15.133 --> 28:16.200
IT'S KIND OF FASCINATING TO SEE

28:16.266 --> 28:17.466
THE DIFFERENT PERFORMANCE

28:17.533 --> 28:18.566
CHOICES DEALERS MAKE WITH THE

28:18.633 --> 28:19.466
SAME AD.

28:19.533 --> 28:20.766
TAKE THIS ONE, THEMED FOR

28:53.066 --> 28:53.633
A "LESS IS MORE" KIND OF THING.

28:53.700 --> 28:54.300
TOMMY KNOWS THE COSTUMES, MUSIC,

28:54.366 --> 28:54.933

CONFIDENT PERFORMANCE.

29:24.700 --> 29:25.766

29:25.833 --> 29:26.400
COULD SAY ABOUT THAT.

29:26.466 --> 29:27.400
I COULD SAY IN THE WORDS OF THAT

29:27.466 --> 29:28.133
MAN'S OBVIOUS IDOL, JIM CARREY,

29:28.200 --> 29:29.200
SOMEBODY STOP HIM.

29:29.266 --> 29:30.500
OR I COULD POINT OUT THE ACCENT

29:30.566 --> 29:31.033
HE'S DOING THERE WOULD BE

29:31.100 --> 29:31.633
PROBLEMATIC IF IT WERE STILL

29:31.700 --> 29:32.733
POSSIBLE TO BE RACIST TOWARDS

29:32.800 --> 29:35.066
GERMANS.

29:35.133 --> 29:36.466
THAT MAN IS JASON FARRIS OF

29:36.533 --> 29:37.633
FARRIS MOTOR COMPANY, AND WHEN

29:37.700 --> 29:39.300
YOU LOOK AT WHAT HE'S DONE WITH

29:39.366 --> 29:40.433
THESE PRO FORMA SCRIPTS, YOU SEE

29:40.500 --> 29:43.033
THAT HE ROUTINELY MAKES SOME

29:43.100 --> 29:44.266
CAPITAL "C" CHOICES, BUT PERHAPS

29:44.333 --> 29:45.800
NONE AS BOLD AS WHEN HE GOT A

29:45.866 --> 29:47.100
STOCK INDEPENDENCE DAY SCRIPT

29:47.166 --> 29:49.800
AND DID THIS:

29:49.866 --> 29:51.033
>> TODAY I'M PLEDGING ALLEGIANCE

29:51.100 --> 29:52.900
TO THE RED, WHITE, AND YOU IN A

29:59.600 --> 30:00.900
BUT HURRY -- LIKE ISIS, THIS

30:00.966 --> 30:02.766
DEAL WON'T BE AROUND LONG.

30:02.833 --> 30:05.900
>> John: NO, JASON!

30:05.966 --> 30:07.433
THAT IS A NO FROM ME!

30:07.500 --> 30:08.566
WE WATCHED A NUMBER OF THOSE

30:08.633 --> 30:09.533
INDEPENDENCE DAY COMMERCIALS AND

30:09.600 --> 30:10.566
GUESS WHICH LINE WASN'T IN ANY

30:10.633 --> 30:12.566
OF THE OTHER SCRIPTS?

30:12.633 --> 30:13.466
YEP.

30:13.533 --> 30:15.633
IT'S THE ONE YOU'RE THINKING OF.

30:15.700 --> 30:17.033
BUT THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT --

30:17.100 --> 30:18.466
EVEN WHEN THEY'RE NOT CASUALLY

30:18.533 --> 30:19.766
ISLAMOPHOBIC -- IT RUINS THE

30:19.833 --> 30:22.166
MAGIC OF THESE WEIRD LOCAL ADS

30:22.233 --> 30:23.366
TO LEARN THAT MANY ARE JUST

30:23.433 --> 30:26.066
SCRIPTS SOMEONE BOUGHT.

30:26.133 --> 30:27.866
THE JOY OF LOCAL CAR COMMERCIALS

30:27.933 --> 30:28.933
IS WHEN THEY POP UP IN THE

30:29.000 --> 30:31.333
MIDDLE OF "WHEEL OF FORTUNE" AND

30:31.400 --> 30:33.133
YOU THINK, "WOW, THIS IS

30:33.200 --> 30:34.800
COMPLETELY DERANGED, BUT AT

30:34.866 --> 30:36.200
LEAST OUR LOCAL CAR DEALER IS

30:36.266 --> 30:36.800
TRYING TO BE CREATIVE.

30:36.866 --> 30:37.866
AT LEAST WE AS A LOCAL MARKET

30:37.933 --> 30:39.133
ARE SPECIAL, RIGHT?"

30:39.200 --> 30:40.833
BUT THAT MIGHT NOT BE THE CASE.

30:40.900 --> 30:41.733
AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT

30:41.800 --> 30:43.633
IS.

30:43.700 --> 30:45.133
WE NEED A RETURN TO THE

30:45.200 --> 30:46.833
ONE-OF-A-KIND AUTO-DEALER AD

30:46.900 --> 30:48.100
THAT NO ONE ELSE HAS.

30:48.166 --> 30:50.000
REMEMBER HOW THRILLING IT WAS TO

30:50.066 --> 30:51.300
SEE BRYCE "THUG NASTY" MITCHELL

30:51.366 --> 30:52.366

30:54.733 --> 30:56.933
I DO.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.433
I LOVE THAT AD, BUT I DON'T WANT

30:58.500 --> 30:59.700
TO SEE 15 COPIES OF THAT.

30:59.766 --> 31:01.466
I WANT BRYCE TO BE A UNICORN.

31:01.533 --> 31:03.066
LOCAL ADS SHOULD BE UNIQUE AND

31:03.133 --> 31:07.033
COMPLETELY UNHINGED.

31:07.100 --> 31:07.633
AND HERE IS WHERE WE MIGHT BE
