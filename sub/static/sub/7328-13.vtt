00:23.191 --> 00:25.693
( sighs ):
Mr. Palmer.

00:27.228 --> 00:29.630
( music blaring in headphones )

00:30.364 --> 00:31.632
Mr. Palmer.
Yes, Doctor.

00:31.665 --> 00:34.768
As a serious and dedicated
student of anatomy...

00:34.802 --> 00:38.439
you are a serious and
dedicated student of anatomy,

00:38.472 --> 00:40.141
are you not?
Uh-huh.

00:40.174 --> 00:41.008
Well, then, Mr. Palmer,

00:41.041 --> 00:43.177
are you up to the task
of identifying

00:43.211 --> 00:45.646
the reconstructive blunder

00:45.679 --> 00:47.315
that has been foisted
upon our deceased?

00:47.348 --> 00:49.283
Uh... uh...

00:49.317 --> 00:51.619
Would you call that
a thumb?

00:51.652 --> 00:53.521
I would call that a toe.

00:53.554 --> 00:54.388
Why then, perchance,

00:54.422 --> 00:56.757
did you place it
with the other digits

00:56.790 --> 00:58.459
from his right hand?

00:58.492 --> 01:00.494
Because that's
where it belongs.

01:00.528 --> 01:01.829
If you look at
the scar line,

01:01.862 --> 01:03.831
it matches perfectly.

01:03.864 --> 01:06.534
Plus, his right foot
had a cleanly-amputated big toe.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.869
This guy lost his thumb
in an accident or something

01:08.902 --> 01:12.140
and had a surgery
to replace it
with the big toe.

01:20.314 --> 01:21.615
My God.

01:21.649 --> 01:23.784
I think I know who this is.

01:26.787 --> 01:30.558
Captioning sponsored by
PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

01:30.591 --> 01:33.727
and CBS

02:16.304 --> 02:18.806
Mm, I love
Filomena's ice cream.

02:18.839 --> 02:20.708
Filomena's in Georgetown?

02:20.741 --> 02:22.743
My standard first date place.

02:22.776 --> 02:26.180
I went there on
a first date Saturday night.

02:26.214 --> 02:27.881
Yeah? After dinner,

02:27.915 --> 02:30.184
I like to stroll
the lucky lady

02:30.218 --> 02:32.320
down Wisconsin to this
pretentious art gallery

02:32.353 --> 02:33.521
called Impressions.

02:33.554 --> 02:35.456
Boy, they really eat it up.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.291
That's where
we went after dinner.

02:37.325 --> 02:38.459
Really?

02:38.492 --> 02:40.394
Huh.

02:41.462 --> 02:43.231
You've been following me.

02:43.264 --> 02:45.233
Me follow you
on a Saturday night?

02:45.266 --> 02:46.934
Not that desperate, Kate.

02:46.967 --> 02:48.001
I don't believe you.

02:48.035 --> 02:50.638
Well, on my mother's life
I was not following you.

02:50.671 --> 02:51.839
Your mother's dead.

02:51.872 --> 02:54.342
I didn't follow her, boss.

02:54.375 --> 02:57.278
I do know her boyfriend,
Steve Adler.

02:57.311 --> 02:58.312
He's not my boyfriend!

02:59.280 --> 03:00.314
I don't believe this.

03:00.348 --> 03:01.849
You tell her about your
fraternity brother yet?

03:01.882 --> 03:03.917
I was just getting to
the good part there, McGee.

03:05.253 --> 03:07.621
Steve Adler is your
fraternity brother?!

03:07.655 --> 03:09.290
I'd show you
the secret handshake,

03:09.323 --> 03:10.524
but then I'd have to kill you.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.394
He told you
about our date?!

03:13.427 --> 03:15.596
Well, not the intimate details.

03:15.629 --> 03:16.764
Until I asked him.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.399
Then he had to.

03:18.432 --> 03:19.700
Goes with the oath.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.270
Gibbs!

03:22.303 --> 03:23.271
DiNozzo!

03:23.304 --> 03:23.837
DUCKY:
Jethro,

03:23.871 --> 03:25.506
I need you in Autopsy.

03:30.478 --> 03:34.248
What he had was
a great toe transplantation,

03:34.282 --> 03:37.285
an incredibly arduous
surgical procedure.

03:37.318 --> 03:39.453
Nerves smaller
than a human hair

03:39.487 --> 03:41.522
are connected using

03:41.555 --> 03:44.325
microscopic sutures.

03:44.358 --> 03:46.026
They sewed his
toe to his hand.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.461
Exactly.

03:47.495 --> 03:48.729
In a catastrophic injury

03:48.762 --> 03:50.431
when the thumb is lost,

03:50.464 --> 03:53.267
the patient's hallux,
or big toe,

03:53.301 --> 03:54.468
is removed

03:54.502 --> 03:56.770
and attached to the hand.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.272
The opposable thumb

03:58.306 --> 03:59.873
is one of the most
important milestones

03:59.907 --> 04:00.874
in human evolution.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.376
It's what makes us us.

04:02.410 --> 04:03.711
Our ability to make tools,

04:03.744 --> 04:04.945
a defining element

04:04.978 --> 04:06.013
which separates
us from animals,

04:06.046 --> 04:08.682
comes directly
from this dexterity.

04:08.716 --> 04:12.353
Drawn-out digressions is a
privilege earned, Mr. Palmer.

04:12.386 --> 04:13.454
Sorry, Doctor.

04:13.487 --> 04:14.622
If I'm right,

04:14.655 --> 04:18.025
the victim's name
is Michael Grant.

04:18.058 --> 04:20.328
He was a Baltimore
District Attorney.

04:20.361 --> 04:21.395
Ten years ago

04:21.429 --> 04:24.432
I testified at several cases
he was prosecuting.

04:24.465 --> 04:26.400
What about
the other bodies, Duck?

04:26.434 --> 04:28.736
Well, at this point I still
have no idea who they are.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.738
We need positive IDs, Duck.

04:30.771 --> 04:31.605
The flesh

04:31.639 --> 04:34.408
was peeled off the pads
of the fingers.

04:34.442 --> 04:36.410
That rules out fingerprints.

04:38.045 --> 04:40.848
The flesh and skin of the
face have also been removed.

04:40.881 --> 04:43.417
So photographic identification

04:43.451 --> 04:45.085
won't be possible, either.
Dental?

04:45.118 --> 04:48.021
Unless we can find a piece
of Michael Grant's DNA,

04:48.055 --> 04:49.857
the dental records
will have to do.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.291
Do it.

04:52.426 --> 04:53.394
Jethro.

04:55.028 --> 04:57.665
A barrel is left at Bethesda

04:57.698 --> 04:58.899
in my jurisdiction

04:58.932 --> 05:01.369
containing three
dissected bodies,

05:01.402 --> 05:02.470
one of whom I knew.

05:02.503 --> 05:04.104
This isn't a coincidence.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.339
Is it?

05:07.941 --> 05:09.643
No, I didn't think it was.

05:14.682 --> 05:17.351
Possible ID on one
of the Meat Puzzle bodies.

05:17.385 --> 05:19.520
DA named Michael Grant.

05:19.553 --> 05:21.689
Hey, cool, after six months,
we finally got a lead, huh?

05:21.722 --> 05:23.457
Find out if he's
been reported missing.

05:24.024 --> 05:26.360
Kate, pull the cases
that Ducky testified

05:26.394 --> 05:27.828
where Michael Grant
was the lead attorney.

05:30.398 --> 05:31.432
Psst.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.403
Hey, it looks like
we're going to work late.

05:35.436 --> 05:36.537
So do you want me
to call Steven

05:36.570 --> 05:37.838
and cancel your
dinner reservation?

05:40.474 --> 05:41.675
This is a nightmare.

05:49.650 --> 05:53.153
If you have a thought about
continuing your genetic line,

05:53.186 --> 05:54.522
I would suggest

05:54.555 --> 05:56.089
a change of position.

05:58.959 --> 05:59.593
Oh!

06:01.529 --> 06:04.432
Jaws expand and contract,

06:04.465 --> 06:05.566
Mr. Palmer.

06:05.599 --> 06:10.438
Teeth wear,
but fillings, crowns,

06:10.471 --> 06:13.874
and bridges remain.

06:13.907 --> 06:17.778
Now let's see.

06:17.811 --> 06:20.748
Four fillings on the
lower left bicuspids...

06:20.781 --> 06:24.518
crowns on the
upper left molars.

06:24.552 --> 06:25.586
It's him.

06:25.619 --> 06:27.655
Yes, it's he.

06:27.688 --> 06:30.424
Dr. Mallard, on
a more personal note...

06:30.458 --> 06:32.426
It's not the best time,
Mr. Palmer.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.928
I just want you to know that I
am determined to learn from you.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.497
Your point, quickly.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.799
It's important for me
to know that you know

06:38.832 --> 06:41.068
that even though there
are nearly 2,000 pieces

06:41.101 --> 06:43.471
of tissue on these tables,
that I... I...

06:43.504 --> 06:46.540
Please come to the point, Jimmy!

06:46.574 --> 06:48.609
I know the difference
between a thumb and a toe.

06:54.515 --> 06:57.618
He called me Jimmy.

06:59.019 --> 07:00.053
TONY:
Michael Grant

07:00.087 --> 07:01.589
disappeared eight months ago

07:01.622 --> 07:03.557
hiking the Appalachian Trail.

07:03.591 --> 07:04.758
His body was never found.

07:04.792 --> 07:07.928
Local LEOs could never determine
if he got lost or killed.

07:07.961 --> 07:09.096
DUCKY:
Definitely killed.

07:09.129 --> 07:10.230
The poor fellow

07:10.263 --> 07:11.665
was then dissected
into small pieces,

07:11.699 --> 07:12.533
put in a barrel

07:12.566 --> 07:15.002
of alcohol along
with two other bodies

07:15.035 --> 07:16.937
and deposited in a dumpster

07:16.970 --> 07:18.739
behind Bethesda
Naval Hospital.

07:18.772 --> 07:19.907
The dental records matched?

07:19.940 --> 07:21.542
I'm afraid so, Jethro.

07:21.575 --> 07:22.610
Ducky?

07:22.643 --> 07:24.244
Remember a Judge Roland Davis?

07:24.277 --> 07:26.079
Of course.
( chuckles )

07:26.113 --> 07:29.249
A man of small stature
and enormous ego.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.619
A highly competent jurist,
nonetheless.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.687
He was the judge
on one of two cases

07:33.721 --> 07:36.089
you testified, where Michael
Grant was the lead attorney.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.091
The significance
of that, Caitlin?

07:38.125 --> 07:40.561
He was reported missing
seven months ago.

07:41.595 --> 07:44.264
I'll run a dental comparison,

07:44.297 --> 07:46.567
the judge with
the two other bodies.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.568
Pull up the case, Kate.

07:51.572 --> 07:54.708
Ah, yes, of course.
( chuckles )

07:54.742 --> 07:55.643
Who could forget him?

07:55.676 --> 07:57.878
Vincent Hanlan.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.880
A medical school washout.

07:59.913 --> 08:02.650
He was studying
to become a...

08:03.751 --> 08:05.553
medical examiner.

08:05.586 --> 08:08.221
He was accused
of raping and murdering

08:08.255 --> 08:09.289
a Navy Lieutenant

08:09.322 --> 08:13.594
who worked at Bethesda
Hospital's pathology lab.

08:14.595 --> 08:18.065
I performed the autopsy.

08:18.098 --> 08:19.533
She was a beautiful girl.

08:19.567 --> 08:23.571
I believe her name
was Lieutenant Sylvia...

08:23.604 --> 08:25.739
Sylvia Waksal.

08:25.773 --> 08:27.174
Yes, that's right.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.609
She was working

08:28.642 --> 08:30.711
late one night.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.546
Vincent Hanlan

08:32.580 --> 08:33.614
stalked her

08:33.647 --> 08:34.848
with the intention
of raping her.

08:34.882 --> 08:39.086
The speculation was that he
was unable to perform the rape.

08:39.119 --> 08:41.589
His impotence so enraged him

08:41.622 --> 08:44.524
that he proceeded to beat
the poor girl to death.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.696
When it went to trial,

08:48.729 --> 08:52.065
Michael Grant was the
prosecuting attorney.

08:52.099 --> 08:55.636
Judge Davis presided.
There's no question.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.104
And I testified.

08:57.137 --> 08:59.573
The evidence was
all circumstantial.

08:59.607 --> 09:00.841
So when the judge
offered the jury

09:00.874 --> 09:02.142
second degree murder,

09:02.175 --> 09:03.276
they accepted it.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.612
Vincent Hanlan

09:04.645 --> 09:05.579
served eight years

09:05.613 --> 09:08.081
in the Maryland Correctional
Adjustment Center.

09:08.115 --> 09:10.017
Kate, start building
a profile on Vincent Hanlan.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.652
Tony.

09:11.685 --> 09:13.320
Find the whereabouts
of everybody else

09:13.353 --> 09:15.689
associated with prosecuting
Vincent Hanlan, fast?

09:15.723 --> 09:18.659
McGee, I need the last address
for Vincent Hanlan.

09:18.692 --> 09:19.793
I want to bring him in.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.764
McGee!

09:23.797 --> 09:26.667
Sorry, boss,
I already found him....

09:26.700 --> 09:27.635
Give me the address.

09:27.668 --> 09:31.171
It's 22 Victor Road,
Mount Ephraim Cemetery.

09:33.707 --> 09:34.775
He's been dead
over a year.

09:43.884 --> 09:45.753
Crown, crown,

09:45.786 --> 09:48.155
match, match,

09:48.188 --> 09:53.661
filling, filling... match.

09:55.128 --> 09:57.998
As we feared...

10:00.267 --> 10:03.270
The second corpse
is Judge Roland Davis.

10:05.438 --> 10:08.241
Any guesses
on number three here?

10:08.275 --> 10:09.376
Carl Foss.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.378
The jury foreman.

10:11.411 --> 10:12.946
Of course.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.815
Missing since last summer.

10:14.848 --> 10:17.885
His X-rays are on their way
over from his family dentist.

10:19.820 --> 10:20.988
Are you okay, Duck?

10:21.021 --> 10:25.258
I assume this macabre play
is being put on for my benefit.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.027
My testimony

10:27.060 --> 10:32.065
was key in putting
Vincent Hanlan in prison.

10:32.099 --> 10:36.236
I was able to lift a partial
print of Vincent's off a body.

10:36.269 --> 10:38.305
Thinking back,

10:38.338 --> 10:39.873
I think I was slightly

10:39.907 --> 10:41.141
unnerved by Hanlan

10:41.174 --> 10:42.275
during the trial.

10:42.309 --> 10:43.176
How so?

10:46.346 --> 10:51.151
He just seemed
particularly agitated

10:51.184 --> 10:54.054
when I was on the stand.

10:55.388 --> 10:57.357
You were the medical examiner
he was never going to be.

10:57.390 --> 11:00.994
I was using his failure
against him.

11:01.028 --> 11:03.964
You'll stay at NCIS
as much as possible.

11:03.997 --> 11:07.034
Other than that, one of us
will be with you at all times.

11:07.067 --> 11:10.771
Jethro, my mother
is 96 years old.

11:10.804 --> 11:12.239
She suffers from dementia.

11:12.272 --> 11:15.075
She gets very nervous when
I'm not home in the evenings.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.676
Tony, you'll take
the first shift.

11:17.911 --> 11:18.912
With his mother.

11:18.946 --> 11:21.348
Uh, doing what, boss?

11:21.381 --> 11:22.582
Whatever she wants.

11:22.615 --> 11:26.820
Yes, it would be helpful if you
could assist with the dogs.

11:26.854 --> 11:30.323
Oh, gosh,
I'm not really

11:30.357 --> 11:32.325
an animal person, Ducky.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.327
I just haven't spent a lot
of time with them lately.

11:34.361 --> 11:35.362
The yappy creatures

11:35.395 --> 11:37.898
are all she has in this life

11:37.931 --> 11:39.232
except me, of course.

11:40.901 --> 11:43.336
If Vincent Hanlan's dead,
who is getting revenge?

11:43.370 --> 11:44.337
His family?

11:44.371 --> 11:45.338
Find 'em, Kate.

11:48.942 --> 11:51.411
According to their tax returns,

11:51.444 --> 11:53.981
Vincent Hanlan's parents
are both morticians.

11:54.014 --> 11:56.516
They've run a funeral home
for the last 13 years.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.151
Siblings.

11:58.185 --> 12:00.353
One brother who's a taxidermist.

12:00.387 --> 12:03.290
Mortician, taxidermist,
wannabe medical examiner.

12:03.323 --> 12:06.927
Yeah, the death obsession
pretty much runs in the family.

12:09.963 --> 12:11.832
MAN:
Vincent's conviction

12:11.865 --> 12:13.801
tore the family apart.

12:13.834 --> 12:16.336
His death
pretty much put us under.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.338
Through here.

12:26.146 --> 12:27.447
Mary...

12:29.282 --> 12:31.151
Get these people out of here.

12:31.184 --> 12:32.052
They're
Federal Agents.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.787
I don't care.
They're here
about Vincent.

12:33.821 --> 12:36.189
They're not authorized.
Get out!

12:36.223 --> 12:37.925
Individuals connected
with Vincent's prosecution

12:37.958 --> 12:39.126
have been
found murdered.

12:39.159 --> 12:40.828
Good.

12:42.295 --> 12:43.196
Good?

12:43.230 --> 12:45.265
Vincent was innocent.

12:45.298 --> 12:46.399
He was a good boy.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.468
He was in medical school.

12:48.501 --> 12:51.805
Jack the Ripper
went to medical school.

12:51.839 --> 12:54.574
When my son got out of prison,
he had nothing left.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.409
No hope. No promise.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.511
They labeled him a sex-murderer.

12:58.545 --> 12:59.479
What was
he doing

12:59.512 --> 13:01.348
when he got out
of prison?

13:01.381 --> 13:03.250
He was drinking.
A lot.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.853
Oh, that's all you have
to say about your dead son?

13:05.886 --> 13:06.887
That's isn't what I meant.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.421
I was just trying to explain

13:08.455 --> 13:10.423
how difficult his life was.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.524
What happened on
the night he died?

13:11.558 --> 13:12.826
He was driving
with his brother

13:12.860 --> 13:13.961
and they hit a tree.

13:13.994 --> 13:16.163
Can you think of anyone
who would want to get revenge

13:16.196 --> 13:17.865
on the men
who put your son in jail?

13:17.898 --> 13:18.531
Me.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.535
But I don't know
anything about it.

13:22.569 --> 13:25.205
So why don't you just
get the hell out of here

13:25.238 --> 13:27.374
before I call the authorities
and have you arrested

13:27.407 --> 13:29.843
and maybe you'll go to prison.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.446
Bastards.

13:37.217 --> 13:41.221
Two bridges, ten crowns,
seven fillings...

13:41.254 --> 13:45.959
Not exactly a paragon of oral
hygiene, my dear fellow.

13:45.993 --> 13:46.927
Is it Carl Foss?

13:46.960 --> 13:49.496
Was there ever any doubt?

13:49.529 --> 13:52.499
Well, that's all three:

13:52.532 --> 13:54.201
prosecutor,

13:54.234 --> 13:58.205
judge and now
foreman of the jury.

13:58.238 --> 13:59.572
Are you scared, Dr. Mallard?

13:59.606 --> 14:02.042
Madame Curie, one of the world's
most brilliant thinkers,

14:02.075 --> 14:06.179
once said, "There is nothing
in life to be feared.

14:06.213 --> 14:09.216
It is only to be understood."

14:09.249 --> 14:12.252
I think it's safe to say that
Madame Curie never set her eyes

14:12.285 --> 14:14.387
on a meat puzzle.

14:14.421 --> 14:16.924
Yes, I'm scared.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.591
Scared as hell.

14:18.625 --> 14:21.028
Put them away,
Jimmy.

14:21.061 --> 14:23.096
They're tired of talking.

14:25.465 --> 14:28.135
They need to rest.

14:32.305 --> 14:34.374
Yes, Doctor.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.580
( knocking )

14:40.613 --> 14:43.250
( barking )

14:43.283 --> 14:48.155
( woman speaking indistinctly )

14:48.188 --> 14:49.656
Yes?

14:49.689 --> 14:51.959
I'm Anthony DiNozzo,
Mrs. Mallard.

14:51.992 --> 14:54.161
I work
with your son.

14:54.194 --> 14:55.996
He called,
said I'd be coming over?

14:56.029 --> 14:57.998
You're Italian.

14:58.031 --> 14:59.299
Yes, I am.

14:59.332 --> 15:02.002
You're a gigolo.

15:02.035 --> 15:05.338
Uh, well, I wouldn't exactly...

15:05.372 --> 15:07.074
You move furniture.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.342
I could.

15:09.376 --> 15:11.511
I have a commode

15:11.544 --> 15:13.246
that has no business
being here.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.347
It belongs

15:14.381 --> 15:15.648
in the lounge.

15:15.682 --> 15:18.051
I've told
Donald this.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.954
He never listens.

15:20.988 --> 15:22.990
I understand. Okay.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.591
If you'll just show me
where you want...

15:26.659 --> 15:28.461
( growling )

15:28.495 --> 15:30.330
Who are you?

15:30.363 --> 15:32.099
Anthony DiNozzo.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.402
Everyone calls me Tony.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.704
That's an Italian name.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.106
Yes, it is.

15:39.139 --> 15:40.507
So if you just show me where...

15:40.540 --> 15:42.042
You're a gigolo.

15:42.642 --> 15:45.112
If you look down my blouse,

15:45.145 --> 15:48.481
I shall disembowel you.

15:48.515 --> 15:51.151
( chuckling ):
That's funny.

15:51.184 --> 15:54.021
I have a knife in my brassiere.

15:54.054 --> 15:56.223
I'll keep that in mind.

15:56.256 --> 15:57.957
Good.

16:01.094 --> 16:02.329
Who are you again?

16:04.031 --> 16:06.133
MAN:
Couldn't there be another case

16:06.166 --> 16:08.168
where these men worked together?

16:08.201 --> 16:12.172
I haven't
found one.

16:12.205 --> 16:15.042
You're brother's case
is the common link.

16:15.075 --> 16:17.344
I would love to have
stuffed Vincent.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.312
( chuckling )

16:19.346 --> 16:20.213
He would've liked that.

16:20.247 --> 16:24.151
Had a good sense of humor,
Vincent did.

16:24.184 --> 16:28.121
But...
it's against state law.

16:30.457 --> 16:32.992
Oh...

16:34.661 --> 16:37.664
"Best Mammal"
at the regionals last year.

16:39.066 --> 16:42.069
Like anything else,
you get obsessed.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.105
Becomes
a way of life.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.543
I thought pandas
were endangered?

16:50.577 --> 16:52.445
Oh, they are.

16:52.479 --> 16:55.115
"Re-creation Category."

16:55.148 --> 16:57.150
I took two black bears

16:57.184 --> 16:58.251
and I bleached one,

16:58.285 --> 17:00.220
and then I sewed them together
in a panda pattern.

17:00.253 --> 17:03.090
You miss your brother?

17:03.123 --> 17:06.293
He's my brother.

17:08.161 --> 17:09.396
You two get along?

17:09.429 --> 17:12.399
When he got out of prison,
he was depressed.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.467
He couldn't go back to school.

17:14.501 --> 17:15.735
He couldn't get a job.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.404
He started drinking heavily.

17:17.437 --> 17:20.073
You didn't answer
my question.

17:20.107 --> 17:22.842
We were close.

17:22.875 --> 17:27.447
And I have no idea who killed
the men that put him in jail.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.116
What happened
the night he died?

17:29.149 --> 17:31.151
Vincent was driving.

17:31.184 --> 17:33.153
He lost control.

17:33.186 --> 17:35.755
We went off the road
into the woods.

17:35.788 --> 17:38.491
My head hit the dash, hard.

17:38.525 --> 17:41.594
I stumbled out of the car

17:41.628 --> 17:43.196
fell to my knees.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.665
When I got my bearings,
I saw the car was on fire.

17:45.698 --> 17:48.168
You feel guilty
you didn't pull him out?

17:48.201 --> 17:51.138
I was told he died
instantly from the impact.

17:51.171 --> 17:53.273
That he never

17:53.306 --> 17:55.308
felt the flames.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.846
I think he felt
the flames.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.283
Oh!

18:03.316 --> 18:05.218
Second place,

18:05.252 --> 18:06.253
nationals,

18:06.286 --> 18:09.122
small animal division.

18:09.156 --> 18:11.124
African civet.

18:11.158 --> 18:13.693
( cell phone ringing )

18:17.164 --> 18:18.298
Yeah, Gibbs.

18:18.331 --> 18:19.866
Boss, I've been
running down other people

18:19.899 --> 18:21.401
involved in
the Vincent Hanlan case.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.535
Got something good.

18:22.569 --> 18:23.403
Spit it out, McGee.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.438
The lead detective
in the Hanlan case

18:25.472 --> 18:28.641
was a Baltimore officer
named Marco Cesaretti.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.810
Retired in '96--
missed his last rent payment,

18:30.843 --> 18:33.513
nobody's seen him
in three weeks.

18:35.348 --> 18:37.150
( phone beeps )

18:37.950 --> 18:40.220
TONY:
Where do you need this?

18:40.253 --> 18:44.324
( grunting )

18:44.357 --> 18:46.326
Mrs. Mallard?

18:46.359 --> 18:47.594
( growling )

18:47.627 --> 18:49.462
Mrs. Mallard!

18:51.364 --> 18:52.165
Who are you?!

18:52.199 --> 18:54.234
And where are you

18:54.267 --> 18:55.735
going with
my commode?

18:55.768 --> 18:58.471
I'm your son's coworker,
remember?

18:58.505 --> 18:59.639
Tony DiNozzo?

19:01.674 --> 19:03.176
The Italian gigolo
furniture mover?

19:03.210 --> 19:04.211
( doorbell chimes )

19:04.244 --> 19:05.845
No!
( gasps )

19:05.878 --> 19:07.547
( barking )

19:08.981 --> 19:09.849
( shrieks )

19:09.882 --> 19:12.185
I'm a Federal Agent, ma'am.

19:12.219 --> 19:14.354
That's what they all say.

19:14.387 --> 19:15.154
( doorbell chimes )

19:15.188 --> 19:16.889
Will you please
go stand over there?

19:16.923 --> 19:20.427
Now.

19:20.460 --> 19:24.264
And keep the girls and
boys in the other room.

19:24.297 --> 19:25.265
Stay.

19:25.298 --> 19:26.299
Quiet down.

19:26.333 --> 19:26.899
What is it?

19:26.933 --> 19:28.235
Delivery.

19:28.268 --> 19:29.536
What kind of delivery?

19:29.569 --> 19:31.838
Don't know, sir.
It just says "perishable."

19:33.373 --> 19:34.507
Shh.

19:36.709 --> 19:37.544
Hi.

19:37.577 --> 19:38.144
Step back, please.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.746
Step back.
Thank you.

19:51.658 --> 19:54.327
DUCKY:
Victim number four, Jethro.

19:54.361 --> 19:57.230
The size of the pieces,
the cuts, are all consistent

19:57.264 --> 20:01.634
with the bodies of the DA,
the judge and the foreman.

20:01.668 --> 20:04.604
The homicide detective
completes the team.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.839
You forgetting the Medical
Examiner, Jethro,

20:06.873 --> 20:11.244
whose testimony put
Vincent Hanlan behind bars.

20:11.278 --> 20:12.845
That's you.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.247
Very good, Mr. Palmer.

20:14.281 --> 20:16.649
He's saving
the best for last.

20:16.683 --> 20:18.351
It's not going to happen, Ducky.

20:18.385 --> 20:20.353
McGEE:
Boss...

20:22.289 --> 20:25.024
DUCKY:
You may load it, Mr. Palmer.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.694
Right, uh,
should I, uh, roll it?

20:27.727 --> 20:28.961
Well, one could do that,

20:28.995 --> 20:32.832
but I think it might be easier
if you used the hand trolley.

20:32.865 --> 20:34.267
Oh, oh, of course.

20:34.301 --> 20:36.002
I was so distracted
by its contents,

20:36.035 --> 20:37.370
I didn't notice it.

20:38.338 --> 20:39.038
Here, let me help you

20:39.071 --> 20:40.807
with this.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.543
The guy works for an independent

20:43.576 --> 20:44.944
delivery service downtown.

20:44.977 --> 20:45.945
Picked up the barrel

20:45.978 --> 20:47.647
from a new client
on 27th Street.

20:47.680 --> 20:48.881
That's the order.

20:48.915 --> 20:51.318
GIBBS:
"Universal Scrap Metal."

20:51.351 --> 20:52.619
The owner called it in.

20:56.323 --> 20:57.990
Yeah, the, uh, print's
kind of small.

20:58.024 --> 20:59.459
Even I had trouble
reading...

20:59.492 --> 21:01.794
Print's fine, McGee.

21:01.828 --> 21:05.365
Jeffrey...
Jeffrey Winston.

21:05.398 --> 21:07.434
Uh, actually,
it's Jeffrey Wilson.

21:07.467 --> 21:09.068
But you're very close, boss.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.570
You sure it's Wilson?

21:17.043 --> 21:18.411
Gibbs is right.

21:18.445 --> 21:20.780
Whoever he is,
he's not going to get you.

21:20.813 --> 21:22.515
There's only one thing
better than looking

21:22.549 --> 21:24.083
into the eyes of
a beautiful woman

21:24.116 --> 21:25.452
and have her say

21:25.485 --> 21:27.387
that everything's
going to be all right.

21:27.420 --> 21:28.988
And what's that, Ducky?

21:29.021 --> 21:30.990
My saying it to her.

21:33.393 --> 21:34.427
All loaded, Doctor.

21:35.928 --> 21:37.797
GIBBS:
You stick to him like....

21:37.830 --> 21:39.332
Glue.

21:39.366 --> 21:41.468
...an ex-wife
after an alimony check.

21:41.501 --> 21:43.503
( chuckles )

21:43.536 --> 21:46.773
Gibbs, what did Ducky look
like when he was younger?

21:49.876 --> 21:51.744
Ilya Kuryakin.

21:52.679 --> 21:55.482
( Tony laughing )

21:55.515 --> 21:56.816
The sweet smell of freedom.

21:56.849 --> 21:57.750
Mrs. Mallard?

21:57.784 --> 21:58.985
Sleeping.

21:59.018 --> 22:01.621
Her usual afternoon
fistful of Wild Turkey.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.490
Her last words to me
were either,

22:03.523 --> 22:06.393
"I'm going to slit your throat"
or "kiss your moat."

22:06.426 --> 22:08.528
I couldn't tell
'cause she was slurring.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.999
That's good work, Tony.

22:13.032 --> 22:14.000
Thank you, boss.

22:14.033 --> 22:16.102
So who's taking over for me now?

22:16.135 --> 22:19.005
Kate's on protection detail
with Ducky.

22:19.038 --> 22:21.374
Yeah?
McGee's...

22:21.408 --> 22:22.208
going with me to interview

22:22.241 --> 22:24.110
the guy who delivered
the barrel.

22:24.143 --> 22:25.845
Yeah.

22:26.879 --> 22:28.948
I guess that leaves you.

22:28.981 --> 22:30.149
Me?! Boss,
I just spent all day

22:30.182 --> 22:33.152
playing furniture mover for this
slightly demented old lady

22:33.185 --> 22:35.422
and her pack of yapping hounds!

22:35.455 --> 22:37.156
They're not
hounds, DiNozzo.

22:37.189 --> 22:39.626
They're Corgis.

22:39.659 --> 22:43.062
No, boss! No, boss!

22:43.095 --> 22:45.164
I'm on the verge, man!

22:45.197 --> 22:48.501
McGee? Boss?

22:49.636 --> 22:51.671
I'm going to go postal!

22:51.704 --> 22:54.407
I'm not kidding! I'm this close!

22:55.575 --> 22:59.078
God!
( dogs barking )

23:00.580 --> 23:03.416
Here's Tony.

23:04.216 --> 23:07.420
Come on. Here you go, guys.

23:07.454 --> 23:08.655
Whoa... Come on.

23:08.688 --> 23:10.122
Who's got treats?

23:10.156 --> 23:11.824
In the house. In the house.

23:11.858 --> 23:13.092
I got treats.

23:13.125 --> 23:14.461
Good boy, Tyson.

23:27.674 --> 23:29.609
You going to badge me?

23:29.642 --> 23:30.943
That's what
they say

23:30.977 --> 23:32.144
on TV.

23:32.178 --> 23:33.212
NCIS.

23:33.245 --> 23:34.581
Naval Criminal Investigative...

23:34.614 --> 23:35.715
MAN:
I know what
it stands for.

23:35.748 --> 23:38.217
Wasn't always
in the junk business.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.487
USS Forestal.

23:40.520 --> 23:41.654
Machinist's Mate First Class.

23:41.688 --> 23:43.055
Are you Jeffrey Wilson?

23:43.089 --> 23:45.458
It's about that barrel,

23:45.492 --> 23:46.659
ain't it?

23:46.693 --> 23:48.861
I knew that deal
was too good.

23:49.896 --> 23:51.731
Tell us about that.

23:52.632 --> 23:54.233
While ago,
this dude comes in.

23:54.266 --> 23:57.504
He... buys
a few of those.

23:57.537 --> 23:58.905
Where do you get 'em?

23:58.938 --> 24:00.773
WILSON:
Back of plants,
factories.

24:00.807 --> 24:01.774
They don't want 'em.

24:01.808 --> 24:03.676
I clean 'em up,
resell 'em.

24:03.710 --> 24:05.244
Okay. Go on.

24:05.277 --> 24:06.579
Well, the dude
brings one

24:06.613 --> 24:08.214
of 'em back,
and it's got some kind

24:08.247 --> 24:09.582
of liquid in it,
'cause I can hear it

24:09.616 --> 24:11.951
sloshing around,
so at first,

24:11.984 --> 24:14.554
I thought it might be
some stuff to make meth.

24:14.587 --> 24:15.955
He offers me 200 bucks

24:15.988 --> 24:19.792
to messenger it
someplace in Reston.

24:19.826 --> 24:21.193
Probably didn't
give his real name.

24:21.227 --> 24:22.795
No name, no address.

24:22.829 --> 24:25.865
Didn't tell me what was in it,
and I didn't ask.

24:25.898 --> 24:27.266
Need you to come
to the Navy Yard,

24:27.299 --> 24:30.136
sit down and describe him
to a sketch artist.

24:30.169 --> 24:31.804
Won't do no good.

24:31.838 --> 24:34.707
Dude always wore
a hooded sweatshirt and shades.

24:34.741 --> 24:36.576
He could've been Elvis.

24:38.678 --> 24:39.979
What was in that barrel anyway?

24:40.012 --> 24:41.881
A meat puzzle.

24:50.322 --> 24:51.824
( shouts ):
Gibbs!

24:51.858 --> 24:53.292
You scared me.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.828
Come on, Abs,
you sleep in a casket

24:55.862 --> 24:56.996
dressed in a funeral gown.

24:57.029 --> 24:58.898
I don't always
wear the gown.

24:58.931 --> 25:00.700
Too much information.

25:00.733 --> 25:02.068
What do we got here?

25:02.101 --> 25:03.603
Straight to the point.
That's our Gibbs.

25:04.904 --> 25:06.639
Okay, bottom line:
the sicko that's killing

25:06.673 --> 25:09.008
everyone that sent
Vincent Hanlan to jail

25:09.041 --> 25:11.043
is definitely not
Vincent Hanlan.

25:14.180 --> 25:15.615
Before Ducky went
to see his mum,

25:15.648 --> 25:17.316
he checked the
dental x-rays

25:17.349 --> 25:19.586
with those from the Maryland
Correctional Adjustment Center.

25:19.619 --> 25:21.654
Vincent Hanlan
is in the casket.

25:21.688 --> 25:23.556
Every last inch of what is

25:23.590 --> 25:26.559
probably very rotting flesh
at this point.

25:26.593 --> 25:28.327
What about a DNA test?

25:28.360 --> 25:30.062
Maryland incinerates
all biological evidence

25:30.096 --> 25:31.230
three years after sentencing.

25:31.263 --> 25:33.232
Okay, find an
earlier X-ray...

25:33.265 --> 25:34.701
before he went to prison.

25:34.734 --> 25:36.703
Before?

25:37.737 --> 25:38.705
Before.

25:38.738 --> 25:40.339
( dogs barking )

25:40.372 --> 25:43.710
Mother, I'm home!

25:43.743 --> 25:45.712
Your dogs...

25:45.745 --> 25:48.881
Oh, not just dogs, Kate--
Welsh Corgis.

25:48.915 --> 25:50.349
Yeah. In Wales,

25:50.382 --> 25:52.351
the Corgi was the protector

25:52.384 --> 25:54.587
of the farmer.

25:54.621 --> 25:56.055
Now they protect
my mother.

25:56.088 --> 25:57.223
That's Tyson.

25:57.256 --> 25:59.726
( chuckles ):
Because he thinks
he's a boxer?

25:59.759 --> 26:01.027
No, because he bites.

26:03.395 --> 26:05.765
The bedrooms
are upstairs.

26:05.798 --> 26:07.066
of course.

26:07.099 --> 26:08.234
Mine's there.

26:08.267 --> 26:10.603
Uh, uh, you could use
the guest room.

26:10.637 --> 26:11.771
I won't be
sleeping, Ducky.

26:11.804 --> 26:13.673
Ah, of course.

26:13.706 --> 26:14.874
Where's your mother's room?

26:14.907 --> 26:18.210
Oh, she sleeps
down here now.

26:18.244 --> 26:19.378
Must be difficult for her

26:19.411 --> 26:21.748
to get up the
stairs at her age.

26:21.781 --> 26:22.715
Has nothing to do

26:22.749 --> 26:24.383
with stairs, Caitlin.

26:24.416 --> 26:25.752
Her snoring
is deafening.

26:25.785 --> 26:27.053
She kept me awake

26:27.086 --> 26:28.755
all night.

26:28.788 --> 26:30.389
She'll keep
you awake, too.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.625
Hello.

26:32.659 --> 26:33.693
( hair dryer blowing )

26:33.726 --> 26:35.361
There you are,

26:35.394 --> 26:36.395
Contessa.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.898
When you're clean,
you're beautiful.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.800
( chuckling ):
Oh!

26:40.833 --> 26:42.969
Oh, Tony,

26:43.002 --> 26:44.737
you've finally found
your true calling.

26:44.771 --> 26:46.405
Mother, may I present
Caitlin.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.240
She works
with Tony and me.

26:48.274 --> 26:48.908
( spits )

26:49.776 --> 26:50.677
Mother!

26:50.710 --> 26:52.278
We talked about this.

26:52.311 --> 26:53.646
Caitlin is here

26:53.680 --> 26:54.781
to protect us.

26:54.814 --> 26:56.382
Show me your knickers.

26:56.415 --> 26:58.951
Um... ma'am?

26:58.985 --> 27:00.953
Your underwear, missy.

27:02.188 --> 27:04.123
One can always tell
a woman's intention

27:04.156 --> 27:05.792
from her panties.

27:05.825 --> 27:07.426
That's always been
my philosophy.

27:07.459 --> 27:08.661
I do apologize.

27:09.428 --> 27:10.697
Come along, Mother.

27:10.730 --> 27:12.965
Time to get dinner ready.

27:12.999 --> 27:14.701
Haven't I had dinner?

27:14.734 --> 27:16.669
DUCKY:
No, you haven't.

27:16.703 --> 27:17.436
Well, use butter tonight.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.806
You always
use bacon fat.

27:19.839 --> 27:21.140
I use canola oil.

27:21.173 --> 27:22.441
I can tell
that, too.

27:22.474 --> 27:26.913
Sometimes, older people
can make so much sense.

27:26.946 --> 27:28.147
You're relieved, Tony.

27:28.180 --> 27:30.316
Oh, God!

27:30.349 --> 27:31.851
Okay. This is Contessa.

27:31.884 --> 27:33.419
She likes it rough.

27:33.452 --> 27:34.386
Good night, Tony.

27:34.420 --> 27:35.755
Yeah, look at the time.

27:35.788 --> 27:37.990
I got to meet Steven
for a beer.

27:39.025 --> 27:40.827
Hate to be late.

27:40.860 --> 27:41.894
So much to
catch up on.

27:44.964 --> 27:46.733
( phone ringing )

27:46.766 --> 27:48.701
Yeah. Gibbs.

27:48.735 --> 27:49.869
Vincent Hanlan's

27:49.902 --> 27:50.937
dental x-rays

27:50.970 --> 27:52.805
just arrived
from medical school.

27:53.305 --> 27:57.043
McGee, you're with me.
Come on.

27:57.143 --> 27:59.245
JIMMY:
These x-rays were taken
at Vincent Hanlan's autopsy,

27:59.278 --> 28:02.448
and these were 11 years ago
when in medical school.

28:02.481 --> 28:03.950
Now, if you look closely,

28:03.983 --> 28:05.284
you can see a
perceptible difference

28:05.317 --> 28:07.987
due to molar wear,
which is highly unusual

28:08.020 --> 28:09.455
given the short
span of years,

28:09.488 --> 28:11.357
at least in modern man.

28:11.390 --> 28:13.726
Neolithic man,
who used to gnaw

28:13.760 --> 28:15.828
a lot of bones, you know,
could incur this kind of...

28:15.862 --> 28:17.229
Are you telling me
these X-rays match?

28:17.263 --> 28:18.998
I'm-I'm afraid so.

28:19.031 --> 28:21.834
The fillings
in the upper third molar

28:21.868 --> 28:24.170
and second bicuspid
are identical,

28:24.203 --> 28:26.105
as are the shape
of the teeth.

28:26.138 --> 28:29.075
He gnaws on bones
like a caveman?

28:29.108 --> 28:31.944
I... can't explain that.

28:31.978 --> 28:34.413
Well, he grinds
his teeth, boss.

28:34.446 --> 28:36.148
Why, I did it as a kid
in my sleep.

28:36.182 --> 28:38.250
I had to wear a special
retainer at night.

28:38.284 --> 28:39.786
You still should.

28:41.087 --> 28:42.922
I want Vincent Hanlan's
body exhumed.

28:42.955 --> 28:44.190
Why? We...

28:45.792 --> 28:47.226
I'm sorry.

28:47.259 --> 28:49.095
I-I didn't mean
to say that, sir.

28:49.128 --> 28:50.997
It just... it just...
spewed out.

28:51.030 --> 28:53.432
Abby, call
Mount Ephraim Cemetery.

28:53.465 --> 28:54.000
McGee, you're with me.

28:54.033 --> 28:56.435
You dig up that body!

28:56.468 --> 28:57.937
Love to!

28:57.970 --> 28:59.271
He's supposed to get
a judge's

28:59.305 --> 29:00.139
authorization.

29:00.172 --> 29:01.974
He didn't even give us
a reason why.

29:02.008 --> 29:04.276
Well, obviously,
Gibbs doesn't think

29:04.310 --> 29:05.978
that Hanlan is dead.

29:06.012 --> 29:07.880
He is dead.
Dental x-rays don't lie.

29:07.914 --> 29:09.816
Well, either
Gibbs is wrong,

29:09.849 --> 29:13.285
or Hanlan is
one of the dead

29:13.319 --> 29:15.521
that still
walks at night.

29:15.554 --> 29:17.123
Okay, well, then Gibbs is wrong.

29:19.225 --> 29:20.226
Isn't he?

29:26.498 --> 29:28.367
( dog barking outside )

29:28.400 --> 29:31.237
( snoring )

29:40.179 --> 29:45.017
( barking continues )

30:10.176 --> 30:11.944
Mrs. Mallard?

30:16.182 --> 30:18.284
Mrs. Mallard.

30:18.317 --> 30:21.053
Sneaking off after
having your fun

30:21.087 --> 30:22.889
just as I knew
you would.

30:22.922 --> 30:24.891
No, it's not like that,
Mrs. Mallard.

30:24.924 --> 30:27.359
Now, please, I need you to take
your dog and go back inside.

30:27.393 --> 30:29.595
Well, that's not my dog.

30:29.628 --> 30:31.197
Of course it's yours.

30:31.230 --> 30:32.164
Now, please, Mrs. Mallard...

30:32.198 --> 30:35.034
I've never seen that
dog before in my life.

30:35.067 --> 30:37.203
I only have Corgis.

30:39.071 --> 30:41.207
Back inside, now!

30:42.408 --> 30:43.609
Ducky?!

30:43.642 --> 30:45.111
Ducky!

30:48.147 --> 30:49.581
( tires screeching outside )

30:49.615 --> 30:50.582
Ducky!

31:12.138 --> 31:13.305
Gibbs, I'm sorry.

31:13.339 --> 31:14.640
It's my fault.

31:14.673 --> 31:16.442
Two agents.

31:16.475 --> 31:17.676
Excuse me?

31:17.709 --> 31:18.677
Two protectees.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.612
I should've had
two agents.

31:20.646 --> 31:23.515
You were as responsible for the
mother as you were for Ducky.

31:28.620 --> 31:30.122
Boss, Abby says
the tire tracks

31:30.156 --> 31:33.092
from the van were made
from Uniroyal Laredos.

31:33.125 --> 31:35.627
They're standard
on Chevy Express cargo vans.

31:35.661 --> 31:38.130
Both the funeral home
and the taxidermy business own

31:38.164 --> 31:39.531
Chevrolet Express cargo vans.

31:39.565 --> 31:41.233
That's good enough
for a search authorizations.

31:41.267 --> 31:42.434
On it.

31:42.468 --> 31:43.169
Tony, you and Kate

31:43.202 --> 31:44.937
take the turkey-stuffing
brother.

31:46.638 --> 31:47.273
McGee, come on.

31:47.306 --> 31:48.574
You're with me.

31:51.110 --> 31:53.479
( sighs )

31:55.047 --> 31:57.116
You have no right
to invade my home

31:57.149 --> 31:58.417
and my business.

31:58.450 --> 32:01.720
Actually, that search warrant
says we do, ma'am.

32:01.753 --> 32:04.023
Don't "ma'am" me,
you simpering wimp.

32:05.257 --> 32:06.025
No, ma'am.

32:06.058 --> 32:08.260
Unlock this door.

32:17.203 --> 32:18.237
Ma'am, if you impede
our search

32:18.270 --> 32:21.273
in any way, you will be charged
with obstruction.

32:21.307 --> 32:23.242
That's not the way
to do this.

32:24.510 --> 32:26.979
I have the right
to break down that door

32:27.013 --> 32:29.315
and anything in my way.

32:35.321 --> 32:36.722
Are you satisfied?

32:36.755 --> 32:37.990
Nope.

32:39.191 --> 32:42.328
McGee, take a scraping
from inside.

32:45.597 --> 32:47.633
One son beats
a young woman to death,

32:47.666 --> 32:49.501
the other one plays
with dead animals.

32:51.137 --> 32:54.073
I wonder where they get that?

32:54.106 --> 32:57.509
From their mother.

32:57.543 --> 32:58.744
JIMMY:
Same teeth.

32:58.777 --> 33:00.379
Vincent Hanlan's corpse

33:00.412 --> 33:02.314
matches
his autopsy X-rays.

33:02.348 --> 33:04.683
Teeth don't lie, Jimmy.

33:09.421 --> 33:10.556
What?

33:13.425 --> 33:16.095
Do you think...

33:17.429 --> 33:19.431
you could get
a blood type

33:19.465 --> 33:21.567
from the nerve tissue
in this tooth?

33:21.600 --> 33:22.634
If I can rehydrate it.

33:22.668 --> 33:23.769
What are you thinking?

33:25.537 --> 33:27.673
I am thinking
something crazy, Abby.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.409
Crazy is good.

33:36.282 --> 33:37.049
It's heavier.

33:37.083 --> 33:39.585
Definitely something
in this one.

33:39.618 --> 33:40.686
Mr. Goldberg.

33:40.719 --> 33:43.122
He's being buried
in the morning.

33:49.828 --> 33:53.132
Check underneath
Mr. Goldberg.

34:16.888 --> 34:18.190
There's nothing.

34:18.224 --> 34:19.658
I'll inform
the Goldbergs

34:19.691 --> 34:25.197
their grandfather was frisked
by NCIS in his coffin.

34:25.231 --> 34:28.300
They're litigators.

34:28.334 --> 34:29.635
( engine starts )

34:38.477 --> 34:39.811
( sighs )

34:39.845 --> 34:40.779
Boss,

34:40.812 --> 34:43.282
van is on the way to the
garage for forensics.

34:43.315 --> 34:44.283
What next?

34:44.316 --> 34:47.153
Why don't you just admit
that you made a mistake

34:47.186 --> 34:49.655
and get the hell
out of here?

34:49.688 --> 34:51.157
( phone rings )

34:51.190 --> 34:52.424
Gibbs.

34:53.825 --> 34:55.294
No joy, boss.

34:55.327 --> 34:56.295
We looked under

34:56.328 --> 34:58.730
every furry
creature...

34:58.764 --> 35:00.666
and inside a couple.

35:00.699 --> 35:01.733
Ducky's not here.

35:01.767 --> 35:05.337
I knew you'd find something,
DiNozzo.

35:05.371 --> 35:07.339
That's good work, Tony.

35:07.373 --> 35:09.308
You bring him in
for interrogation.

35:09.341 --> 35:11.243
Did you hear what I said, boss?

35:11.277 --> 35:12.911
Yeah.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.246
Yeah, I heard you.

35:17.783 --> 35:19.285
( chuckles )

35:19.318 --> 35:20.252
Let's go, McGee.

35:20.286 --> 35:22.354
What'd they find?

35:28.394 --> 35:29.161
Jonathan called.

35:29.195 --> 35:31.263
They're searching
his shop, too.

35:31.297 --> 35:32.464
What do they think?

35:32.498 --> 35:34.533
He stuffe their
precious doctor?

35:34.566 --> 35:38.704
Mary, we should do
something to prevent...

35:38.737 --> 35:39.838
Fred, Fred,
shh, shh, shh.

35:39.871 --> 35:41.540
Don't start thinking now.

35:41.573 --> 35:43.509
You're far too old for that.

35:48.580 --> 35:49.448
I already told you.

35:49.481 --> 35:50.282
Tell me again.

35:50.316 --> 35:52.284
We crashed into a tree.

35:52.318 --> 35:54.320
Vincent was driving?

35:54.353 --> 35:55.521
Yes.

35:55.554 --> 35:57.389
You jumped out of the car.

35:57.423 --> 35:58.257
That's right.

35:59.558 --> 36:02.294
You didn't even attempt
to help your brother?

36:02.328 --> 36:04.396
Car was on fire.

36:04.430 --> 36:05.764
I was in a daze.

36:05.797 --> 36:08.767
But you didn't even try.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.702
It was too hot!

36:13.539 --> 36:15.307
There was no way
I could get to him.

36:23.682 --> 36:26.785
What did your mother
think about that?

36:26.818 --> 36:28.654
I wouldn't know.

36:28.687 --> 36:31.390
We don't talk.

36:31.423 --> 36:33.892
We haven't spoken
since that night.

36:33.925 --> 36:35.361
Yeah? Why is that?

36:36.862 --> 36:38.397
He was her favorite.

36:38.430 --> 36:41.500
She blames you for his death.

36:47.606 --> 36:52.711
If my friend dies,
I'll blame you, too.

36:56.415 --> 36:58.450
KATE:
Gibbs, uh, Jimmy Palmer

36:58.484 --> 36:59.418
and Abby need
to see you.

37:03.822 --> 37:05.757
JIMMY:
I pulled one
of Vincent Hanlan's teeth

37:05.791 --> 37:07.459
and gave it to Abby.

37:07.493 --> 37:09.428
We did a blood analysis
of the nerve tissue

37:09.461 --> 37:11.263
and compared it
to the blood type

37:11.297 --> 37:12.664
of the tissue from the corpse.

37:13.699 --> 37:15.367
BOTH:
They didn't match.

37:15.401 --> 37:17.403
These are Vincent
Hanlan's teeth,

37:17.436 --> 37:18.270
but they were put
into this jaw.

37:18.304 --> 37:20.539
This body is not
Vincent Hanlan's.

37:20.572 --> 37:21.673
I did a gas chromatograph

37:21.707 --> 37:22.774
and I found traces

37:22.808 --> 37:24.576
of cyanoacrylate
on the bottom of the....

37:24.610 --> 37:27.479
In a language I speak, Abby.

37:27.513 --> 37:30.316
There is Super Glue
on the root of the tooth.

37:30.349 --> 37:32.984
Just a drop. It would
never show up on an X-ray.

37:33.018 --> 37:35.321
So the teeth were pulled
from Vincent's mouth?

37:35.354 --> 37:36.288
One by one.

37:36.322 --> 37:39.858
And then they were glued
back into this jaw.

37:46.732 --> 37:51.437
Homo Sapien.
Reconstruction Category.

37:51.470 --> 37:53.639
Someone took your
brother's teeth

37:53.672 --> 37:55.674
and put them in that skull.

37:57.409 --> 37:58.477
It wasn't me.

38:02.381 --> 38:03.649
It was them.

38:03.682 --> 38:05.351
It was always them.

38:05.384 --> 38:06.885
Your mother and Vincent?

38:09.621 --> 38:13.459
Vincent was drunk the night
he slammed into that tree.

38:13.492 --> 38:15.427
We got out just before

38:15.461 --> 38:16.428
it burst into flames.

38:16.462 --> 38:17.663
When we got home,

38:17.696 --> 38:24.035
Mother had a car-crash body
laid out on the embalming table.

38:24.069 --> 38:27.105
Closed-casket job.

38:27.138 --> 38:30.476
She came up with the idea
of giving Vincent a new life.

38:30.509 --> 38:32.110
He's got to be
telling the truth.

38:32.143 --> 38:33.412
Why?

38:33.445 --> 38:36.047
Who would make that up?

38:36.081 --> 38:38.484
JONATHAN:
After she extracted
Vincent's teeth

38:38.517 --> 38:40.051
and put them in
the car-crash body,

38:40.085 --> 38:43.655
she burnt the corpse
beyond recognition.

38:43.689 --> 38:45.624
Where's Vincent?

38:45.657 --> 38:47.726
( sobbing )

38:47.759 --> 38:49.428
With Mother.

38:49.461 --> 38:50.562
He's always with Mother.

38:50.596 --> 38:51.797
We already searched
the funeral home.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.064
Look harder.

38:53.098 --> 38:54.366
GIBBS:
Is Dr. Mallard there?

38:54.400 --> 38:55.467
Probably.

38:55.501 --> 38:57.803
They don't keep you informed?

38:57.836 --> 39:00.539
They have lots of secrets.

39:00.572 --> 39:05.010
Terrible secrets
with each other.

39:07.846 --> 39:09.381
You call your mother, Jonathan.

39:11.517 --> 39:12.951
You tell her
we've released you.

39:12.984 --> 39:15.921
You tell her
that everything is okay now.

39:15.954 --> 39:18.490
That we have run
into a dead end.

39:18.524 --> 39:20.659
You convince her, Jonathan.

39:20.692 --> 39:25.397
If you don't,
I will tear every tooth

39:25.431 --> 39:27.032
out of your skull.

39:37.576 --> 39:41.547
( muffled cries )

39:43.449 --> 39:44.483
I got a light.

39:44.516 --> 39:45.016
Let's go.

39:45.884 --> 39:46.618
Wait.

39:46.652 --> 39:47.352
For what?

39:47.385 --> 39:49.421
GIBBS:
Let them get Ducky out

39:49.455 --> 39:50.956
of wherever they've
been hiding him.

39:51.990 --> 39:52.991
Now?

39:53.024 --> 39:53.925
Not yet.

39:55.594 --> 39:58.897
Okay, get into positions.

40:05.003 --> 40:07.405
It'll only take four minutes
to drain your blood.

40:12.578 --> 40:14.079
Versus eight years...

40:15.547 --> 40:17.883
in the same cell...

40:17.916 --> 40:19.518
24 hours a day.

40:19.551 --> 40:21.520
He's getting off easy, angel.

40:26.625 --> 40:28.126
( muffled cry )

40:28.159 --> 40:33.599
( moaning )

40:38.203 --> 40:39.404
( moaning )

40:43.274 --> 40:44.476
Where are they?!

40:47.212 --> 40:48.847
Turn around.
Hands out.

40:53.519 --> 40:54.820
He's clean.

40:54.853 --> 40:56.187
( moaning )

40:57.689 --> 40:58.957
Get back!

40:58.990 --> 41:01.627
( muffled cries )

41:01.660 --> 41:02.861
Move back.

41:02.894 --> 41:04.596
Or you're dead.

41:07.566 --> 41:08.700
GIBBS:
Tony.

41:09.868 --> 41:11.803
My hands.
Release my hands!

41:16.675 --> 41:18.810
Get me something
to stop the bleeding!

41:22.848 --> 41:24.215
Hands in the air!

41:24.249 --> 41:25.784
I can't go back there.

41:25.817 --> 41:28.253
Just do what they say, Vincent.

41:28.286 --> 41:29.855
Turn around,

41:29.888 --> 41:30.722
face the wall.

41:30.756 --> 41:32.591
MARY:
Just do it.

41:36.127 --> 41:38.496
I love you, Mother,
but I can't do this again.

41:40.966 --> 41:41.567
No!

41:41.600 --> 41:43.201
No!

41:43.234 --> 41:45.571
My God, no!

41:45.604 --> 41:47.606
( gasping )

41:47.639 --> 41:48.707
( sobbing and screaming )

41:48.740 --> 41:50.609
They killed my son!

41:50.642 --> 41:51.710
Come on. Let's go.

41:51.743 --> 41:54.145
They killed...

41:57.315 --> 42:00.586
You're the one that
got off easy, my boy.

42:03.154 --> 42:04.756
What kept you?

42:11.697 --> 42:13.298
The mother finally
gave a statement?

42:13.331 --> 42:14.966
Yeah.
Short one... two words.

42:19.270 --> 42:21.106
TONY:
So, you seeing
my frat bro tonight?

42:21.139 --> 42:22.574
As a matter of fact, I am.

42:22.608 --> 42:24.676
Steven feels bad.

42:24.710 --> 42:25.877
Said he'd like
to make it up to me.

42:25.911 --> 42:27.613
How's he gonna do that?

42:28.680 --> 42:30.081
By telling me things about you.

42:30.115 --> 42:31.717
Never gonna happen.

42:31.750 --> 42:34.252
The Fraternal Oath is sacred.

42:35.721 --> 42:37.789
Some things are even
more sacred, Tony.
