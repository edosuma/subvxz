01:47.840 --> 01:49.170

01:49.240 --> 01:51.240
JUST BE HAPPY WITH
WHAT YOU'VE GOT, SON.

01:51.310 --> 01:53.380

WHAT AN R.V.!

02:05.650 --> 02:06.280
BART!

02:06.360 --> 02:07.430
UH, I SUPPOSE

02:07.490 --> 02:09.360
IT HAS
VARIOUS FEATURES...

02:09.430 --> 02:12.200
IT'S GOT EVERYTHING--
MICROWAVE, DISHWASHER

02:12.260 --> 02:13.830
BIG SCREEN TV,
DEEP FRYER

02:13.900 --> 02:15.300

A SATELLITE DISH!

02:16.970 --> 02:18.540
YES, INDEEDLY-DOODLY.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.540
HOW CAN YOU AFFORD THIS, NED?

02:20.600 --> 02:22.300
I GET YOUR MAIL ONCE IN AWHILE

02:22.370 --> 02:25.640
AND YOU MAKE ONLY $27 A WEEK
MORE THAN I DO.

02:25.710 --> 02:27.450
IT'S SIMPLE, SIMPSON.
CREDIT!

02:27.510 --> 02:28.850

I'D LIKE TO SEE

DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING
THAT'S BETTER THAN
THE "LAND BEHEMOTH?"

02:49.030 --> 02:52.200
YES WE DO. THAT WOULD BE
THE "ULTIMATE BEHEMOTH."

02:52.270 --> 02:53.070
WHERE IS IT?

02:53.140 --> 02:55.610
WE ARE STANDING IN ITS PRESENCE.

02:55.670 --> 02:56.670
BEHOLD!

02:56.740 --> 02:57.710
OH!

02:57.770 --> 02:58.900
OH, WOW!

02:58.970 --> 03:00.500
LOOK AT THIS THING.

03:00.580 --> 03:01.180
MEN BUILT THIS.

03:01.240 --> 03:02.440
IT'S A VEHICLE.

03:02.510 --> 03:04.480
DOES IT HAVE
ITS OWN SATELLITE DISH, SIR?

03:04.550 --> 03:08.720
YOU CAN TELL YOUR SON
IT HAS ITS OWN <i>SATELLITE.</i>

03:08.780 --> 03:10.980
THE <i>VANSTAR I
LAUNCHED LAST FEBRUARY.</i>

03:11.050 --> 03:12.380
JUST FOR THIS THING.

03:12.450 --> 03:13.680
WHOA, MAN.

03:13.760 --> 03:14.990
I'M NOT SURE
THAT WE CAN AFFORD...

03:15.060 --> 03:17.360
DOES IT HAVE
A DEEP FRYER?!

03:17.430 --> 03:20.030
FOUR-- ONE FOR EACH
PART OF THE CHICKEN.

03:20.100 --> 03:21.730
I DON'T THINK WE CAN
AFFORD THIS, HOMER.

03:21.800 --> 03:23.330
LET'S WORRY ABOUT THAT LATER.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.600
COME ON. LET'S TAKE A TOUR.
WANT TO? COME ON!

Bart:
<i>AY, CARAMBA!</i>

03:29.910 --> 03:31.980
THIS IS BETTER
THAN OUR HOUSE.

03:32.040 --> 03:35.050
WAIT TILL FLANDERS
GETS A LOAD OF THIS.

03:35.110 --> 03:37.120
IT'S SEEMS SO EXPENSIVE.

03:37.180 --> 03:39.150
( <i>ships horn blows )
OH, HEY.</i>

03:40.150 --> 03:41.320
HOW MUCH IS IT?

03:41.380 --> 03:43.750
YOU'RE A MAN
OF YOUR CONVIC...

03:43.820 --> 03:46.260
YOU WANTED TO ASK THAT
AND BLURTED IT OUT, DIDN'T YOU?

03:46.320 --> 03:47.460
YEAH, HOW MUCH?

03:47.520 --> 03:48.850
FIRST OF ALL

03:48.920 --> 03:51.850
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
I LIKE YOUR FACE.

03:51.930 --> 03:52.900
YOU DO?

03:52.960 --> 03:54.370
I REALLY DO.

03:54.430 --> 03:55.530
I'M NOT SAYIN' THAT.
I MEAN IT.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.240
YOU'VE GOT COLOR
IN THERE.

03:57.300 --> 03:58.200
YOU'RE NOT ROMAN, ARE YOU?

03:58.270 --> 03:59.270
NO.

03:59.330 --> 04:01.600
LOOK LIKE A GOD,
SORT OF.

04:01.670 --> 04:04.280
WHY DON'T WE STEP INTO
THE CREDIT OFFICE, ZEUS?

04:04.340 --> 04:07.280
HEY, YOUR DAD'S GOING
TO WORK IT OUT

04:07.340 --> 04:09.370
AND THEN YOU'LL DRIVE
HOME IN THIS.

04:10.810 --> 04:12.410
I WON'T QUOTE A PRICE

04:12.480 --> 04:14.390
TILL I CHECK
YOUR CREDIT RATING.

04:14.450 --> 04:17.589
YOU UNDERSTAND
THIS IS A FORMALITY.

04:17.649 --> 04:21.180
IF YOU'RE SAYING TO ME:
"BOB, IS THIS GUY
IS GOOD FOR IT."

04:21.260 --> 04:23.060
I SAY, YES.
I DON'T CHECK THIS MACHINE.

04:23.130 --> 04:26.160
BUT I DON'T OWN THE PLACE,
EVEN THOUGH MY NAME'S UP THERE.

04:26.230 --> 04:28.500
LONG STORY,
BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.160
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
RUN IT THOUGH THE COMPUTER.

04:30.230 --> 04:32.140
( <i>siren wailing )</i>

04:32.200 --> 04:33.540
IS THAT A GOOD SIREN?

04:33.600 --> 04:34.940
AM I APPROVED?

04:35.000 --> 04:37.600
YOU EVER KNOWN
A SIREN TO BE GOOD?

04:37.670 --> 04:39.200
NO, MR. SIMPSON,
IT'S NOT.

04:39.270 --> 04:40.900
IT'S A BAD SIREN.

04:40.980 --> 04:44.020
THAT'S THE COMPUTER,
IN CASE I WENT BLIND, TELLING ME

04:44.080 --> 04:45.150
"SELL THE VEHICLE TO THIS FELLA

04:45.210 --> 04:46.570
AND YOU'RE OUT
OF BUSINESS."

04:46.650 --> 04:48.520
THAT'S WHAT THE SIREN SAYS.

04:48.580 --> 04:51.350
SEEMS THE ULTIMATE BEHEMOTH
IS A WEE BIT OUT OF
YOUR PRICE RANGE.

04:51.420 --> 04:54.430
AND "WEE BIT" IS ME
BEING POLITE.

04:54.490 --> 04:56.260
YOU COULDN'T
AFFORD THIS THING

04:56.330 --> 04:57.760
IF YOU LIVED
TO BE A MILLION.

04:57.830 --> 05:00.870
DON'T YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT
ISN'T OUT OF MY PRICE RANGE?

05:00.930 --> 05:02.970
I DON'T WANT TO GO AWAY
EMPTY-HANDED, BOB.

05:03.030 --> 05:04.270
TAKE IT EASY.

05:04.330 --> 05:06.760
DON'T RUIN THIS FEELING
I'M GETTING FROM YOU.

05:06.840 --> 05:10.840
PERHAPS I CAN
SHOW YOU SOMETHING..
A LITTLE MORE <i>YOU.</i>

05:13.510 --> 05:14.610
Bob:
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

05:14.680 --> 05:15.750
UGH.

05:15.810 --> 05:17.680
Bart:
YOU GOT TO
BE KIDDING.

05:17.750 --> 05:19.250
USED, ISN'T IT?

05:19.310 --> 05:19.940
WHAT?

05:20.020 --> 05:21.150
IS IT USED?

05:21.220 --> 05:22.250
MR. SIMPSON,

05:22.320 --> 05:24.160
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA OWN
A BETTER R.V.

05:24.220 --> 05:26.660
AND I DON'T MEAN THAT
IN A GOOD WAY. I MEAN
LITERALLY, THIS IS IT FOR YOU.

05:26.720 --> 05:28.760
IT'S THIS OR A WAGON.

05:28.820 --> 05:30.920
HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT FOR IT?

05:30.990 --> 05:32.420
THIS IS YOURS? THE PRICE I'M
QUOTING YOU?

05:32.490 --> 05:33.960
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAND IT
TO SOMEONE ELSE?

05:34.030 --> 05:34.930
I'M QUOTING <i>YOUR PRICE.</i>

05:35.000 --> 05:36.530
SOMEONE ELSE, I'D DOUBLING THIS.

05:36.600 --> 05:37.640
I SWEAR IT, BOB.

05:37.700 --> 05:39.270
- THIS IS YOU AND ME.
- YEAH.

05:39.330 --> 05:40.660
IN OTHER WORDS, TWO MONTHS
FROM NOW, I SEE THIS VEHICLE

05:40.740 --> 05:41.810
YOUR HEAD'S IN THAT WINDOW.

05:41.870 --> 05:42.470
ON MY HONOR.

05:42.540 --> 05:43.810
$350 A MONTH.

05:43.870 --> 05:45.530
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
WOULD IT BE ALL RIGHT

05:45.610 --> 05:48.180
IF I CONFERRED WITH MY FAMILY?

05:48.240 --> 05:49.470
WELL, MR. SIMPSON

05:49.540 --> 05:52.510
IF YOU HAVE TO DISCUSS IT
WITH THOSE.. HUMANS

05:52.580 --> 05:53.890
THEN THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG WITH ALL OF US.

05:53.950 --> 05:55.950
YOU LOOK LIKE A MAN WHO IS
ABLE TO MAKE A DECISION

05:56.020 --> 05:57.590
OR I WOULDN'T BE WASTING--
SEE THAT MAN?

05:57.650 --> 05:58.980
YEAH.

05:59.050 --> 06:00.580
HE'S BUYING THIS.
DID YOU KNOW THAT?
NO!

06:00.660 --> 06:02.260
CALLED ME TWO MINUTES
BEFORE YOU CAME IN

06:02.320 --> 06:03.620
SAID, "SAVE
THE LITTLE ONE."

06:03.690 --> 06:05.260
HERE HE IS.

06:05.330 --> 06:06.400
YOU WANT IT, OR NOT?

06:06.460 --> 06:07.600
I'LL TAKE IT.

06:07.660 --> 06:09.160
BEST DECISION
YOU'LL EVER MAKE.

TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE.

LOADS OF FUN.

06:27.850 --> 06:28.950
EVERYBODY READY?

06:29.020 --> 06:30.690
I HATE THIS.
I DON'T WANT TO GO.

06:30.750 --> 06:32.410
THAT'S THE SPIRIT.

06:32.490 --> 06:33.860
READY OR NOT, NATURE

PFFT...MAPS!

WE ALL ARE, DEAR.

BUT YOUR FATHER
SAYS NOT TO WORRY.

THAT'S NICE LISA, BUT WE'RE NOT
IN ASTRONOMY CLASS.

09:51.740 --> 09:53.370
WE'RE IN THE WOODS.

09:53.440 --> 09:55.440
( <i>groaning )</i>

10:01.450 --> 10:03.780
SHOULD MAGGIE BE GOING
WITH THEM, MOM?

10:03.850 --> 10:05.550
THEY WON'T BE GONE LONG.

10:05.620 --> 10:06.720
SHE'S IN GOOD HANDS.

10:12.120 --> 10:14.650
THERE AREN'T ANY DANGEROUS
ANIMALS IN THE FOREST

10:14.730 --> 10:15.930
ARE THERE, DAD?

10:15.990 --> 10:17.390
MIGHT BE A FEW, BUT
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

10:17.460 --> 10:20.120
IF YOU LEAVE THEM ALONE,
THEY'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE.

10:20.200 --> 10:21.300
IT'S A DEAL.

10:21.370 --> 10:22.800
DON'T ACT AFRAID.

10:22.870 --> 10:26.140
ANIMALS CAN SMELL FEAR,
AND THEY DON'T LIKE IT.

10:26.200 --> 10:28.300
BESIDES, THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE AFRAID OF.

10:28.370 --> 10:29.270
RIGHT.

10:30.510 --> 10:32.280
( <i>sucking noise )</i>

10:32.340 --> 10:33.840
A RATTLER!

10:33.910 --> 10:34.980
I'M NOT AFRAID.
I'M NOT AFRAID.

10:35.050 --> 10:36.120
RUN, YOU FOOL!

10:36.180 --> 10:38.920
( <i>screaming )</i>

10:43.660 --> 10:46.030
( <i>gasping )</i>

10:47.860 --> 10:49.660
AH, THROUGH HERE, BOY.

10:49.730 --> 10:51.030
BACK TO CIVILIZATION.

10:51.100 --> 10:52.870
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

10:52.930 --> 10:55.570
EXPERIENCED WOODSMEN LIKE ME
GET A FEEL FOR THESE THINGS.

10:55.630 --> 10:59.700
IT BECOMES NATURAL,
LIKE A THIRD SENSE.

10:59.770 --> 11:02.080
( <i>screaming )</i>

11:03.740 --> 11:10.250
( <i>screaming )</i>

11:11.980 --> 11:13.710
( <i>humming happily )</i>

11:16.660 --> 11:19.960
THE BOYS CERTAINLY
ARE TAKING A LONG TIME.

11:20.030 --> 11:23.330
I HOPE MAGGIE ISN'T
SLOWING THEM UP TOO MUCH.

11:25.630 --> 11:27.130
( <i>growling )</i>

11:29.900 --> 11:31.340
( <i>snarling )</i>

( <i>coughing )</i>

11:43.050 --> 11:45.850
BART, WHERE ARE YOU, BART?

11:45.920 --> 11:47.990
OH! HIS LUCKY RED HAT.

11:48.050 --> 11:49.680
OH, DEAR GOD!

11:49.750 --> 11:52.320
NO! BART!

11:52.390 --> 11:54.730
B-B-BART!

11:54.790 --> 11:55.850
( <i>coughing )</i>

11:57.800 --> 11:59.030
( <i>panting )</i>

11:59.100 --> 12:01.270
OH, BART!

12:01.330 --> 12:03.430
OH, BART,
MY BEAUTIFUL SON.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.910
WHY COULDN'T YOU HAVE TAKEN ME?!

12:05.970 --> 12:08.710
OF ALL THE FATES
ON HEAVEN AND EARTH

12:08.770 --> 12:11.140
WHY DID THIS ONE BEFALL ME?

12:11.210 --> 12:12.310
( <i>sobbing )</i>

12:12.380 --> 12:13.950
Bart:
DON'T HAVE
A COW, DAD.

12:14.010 --> 12:14.980
WHAT THE...

12:15.050 --> 12:16.450
OOH!

12:16.510 --> 12:18.080
YOU'RE ALIVE!

12:18.150 --> 12:20.220
AND, HEH-HEH,
BUCK NAKED.

12:20.290 --> 12:22.260
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE, HOMEBOY.

12:22.320 --> 12:23.290
WHAT?

12:23.360 --> 12:24.960
OHH.

12:25.020 --> 12:26.580
( <i>laughing )
JUNGLE MAN.</i>

12:26.660 --> 12:29.060
( <i>Tarzan yell )</i>

12:29.130 --> 12:30.100
( <i>laughing )</i>

12:42.840 --> 12:44.280
THE FIRST THING
YOU LEARN

12:44.340 --> 12:46.070
ABOUT SURVIVING
IN THE WOODS:

12:46.140 --> 12:47.710
CONCEAL YOUR NAKEDNESS.

12:47.780 --> 12:49.080
YEAH, MAN.

12:49.150 --> 12:51.750
OKAY, SLAP A FERN
ON THERE, BOY.

12:51.820 --> 12:53.420
NOW SOME MUD.

12:53.490 --> 12:55.320
THERE... OOH!

12:55.390 --> 12:58.230
THAT REQUIRES
A LITTLE MOSS.

12:58.290 --> 12:59.990
AND SOME MOSS FOR ME.

13:00.060 --> 13:03.100
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE READY
TO HIT THE TOWN.

13:03.160 --> 13:04.970
DAD, I AM SO HUNGRY.

13:05.030 --> 13:06.970
CAN'T WE EAT SOMETHING FIRST?

13:07.030 --> 13:08.170
I'M STARVING, MAN.

13:08.230 --> 13:10.460
AH, FOOD.
GOOD THINKING, SON.

13:10.540 --> 13:13.270
THIS YOUNG SAPLING
OUGHT TO DO THE TRICK.

13:15.940 --> 13:16.980
WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO DO--

13:17.040 --> 13:17.910
HANG OURSELVES?

13:17.980 --> 13:19.280
NO, THIS IS A TRAP.

13:19.340 --> 13:21.910
IT'S GOING TO CATCH US
OUR DINNER.

13:23.150 --> 13:24.050
SHH.

13:24.120 --> 13:24.920
JUST WATCH.

13:27.190 --> 13:28.890
OOH!

13:30.360 --> 13:31.290
AHA!

13:31.360 --> 13:32.090
GOT HIM.

13:35.790 --> 13:36.790
( thud )

13:36.860 --> 13:38.000
OKAY, THIS TIME

13:38.060 --> 13:40.090
I'LL JUST GO INTO THE BUSHES

13:40.170 --> 13:43.640
MAKE A LOT OF NOISE
AND FLUSH OUT A RABBIT.

13:43.700 --> 13:46.440
WHEN HE COMES OUT,
YOU STEP ON HIM.

13:46.500 --> 13:47.830
RIGHT, DAD.

13:50.740 --> 13:51.650
( <i>screaming )</i>

13:51.710 --> 13:53.610
GET THEM OFF ME!

13:53.680 --> 13:55.150
GET THEM OFF ME!

13:55.210 --> 13:57.510
( <i>shrieking )</i>

14:01.090 --> 14:02.960
GREAT CAMPING TRIP,
HONEY.

14:03.020 --> 14:04.290
TRAVELED 800 MILES

14:04.360 --> 14:06.330
HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN
A SQUIRREL YET.

14:06.390 --> 14:08.760
Woman:
THE RANGER AT THE GATE
SAID WE SHOULD WATCH OUT
FOR BEARS.

14:08.830 --> 14:11.830
OH, BEARS--
RIGHT, RIGHT.

14:11.900 --> 14:13.930
LET ME SHOW YOU HOW MANY BEARS
THERE ARE AROUND HERE.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.940
UH... HELLO, BEARS.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.370
C'MON, HAVE A DOUGHNUT.

14:19.440 --> 14:21.010
WHAT THE HECK--
HAVE ME.

14:21.070 --> 14:22.170
COME AND GET IT.

14:22.240 --> 14:24.780
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
YOU MADE YOUR POINT.

14:24.840 --> 14:26.240
HMPH.
BEARS!

14:55.310 --> 14:56.580
( <i>owl hoots )</i>

14:56.640 --> 14:58.150
( <i>sigh )</i>

14:58.210 --> 15:01.350
I HOPE MAGGIE AND THE BOYS
ARE ALL RIGHT.

15:01.410 --> 15:02.870
I'M SURE THEY'RE JUST FINE.

15:02.950 --> 15:05.120
AFTER ALL, WE BUILT A FIRE

15:05.180 --> 15:07.950
AND WE DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT NATURE.

15:08.020 --> 15:10.960
IMAGINE WHAT YOUR FATHER, AN
EXPERIENCED WOODSMAN, HAS DONE.

15:11.020 --> 15:12.720
YEAH, I SUPPOSE SO.

15:12.790 --> 15:13.930
NIGHT, MOM.

15:15.830 --> 15:17.200
GOOD NIGHT, DEAR.

15:19.630 --> 15:24.440
G-G-G-G-GOOD N-N-N-NIGHT,
D-D-DAD.

15:24.500 --> 15:27.060
G-G-GOOD N-N-NIGHT, SON.

15:27.140 --> 15:29.410
SL-SL-SLEEP TIGHT.

15:31.240 --> 15:34.040
( <i>wolf bays in distance )</i>

15:35.280 --> 15:38.050

ARE WE THERE YET?

15:47.630 --> 15:48.530
Homer:
NO!

15:48.590 --> 15:49.320
ARE WE EVER
GOING TO BE THERE?

15:49.390 --> 15:50.650
HOW WOULD I KNOW?

15:50.730 --> 15:52.070
QUIT ASKING POINTLESS...

15:52.130 --> 15:53.230
( <i>gasp )
BART!</i>

15:53.300 --> 15:54.170
LOOK.

15:55.600 --> 15:56.570
HONEY.

15:56.630 --> 15:57.900
HONEY!

15:57.970 --> 15:59.210
WE'RE SAVED!

15:59.270 --> 16:00.570
UH, HOMER?

16:00.640 --> 16:01.580
BEES?

16:04.240 --> 16:04.780
HOW IS IT?

16:04.840 --> 16:06.440
TANGY.

16:12.150 --> 16:13.920
WATAH! WATAH!

16:13.990 --> 16:14.490
WHAT?

16:14.550 --> 16:15.650
WATAH!

16:15.720 --> 16:16.790
OH, WATER.

16:16.850 --> 16:17.850
THATAWAY, MAN.

16:17.920 --> 16:18.750
OOH!

16:24.030 --> 16:24.830
AHHH!

AH!

16:32.640 --> 16:34.340
( <i>screaming )</i>

16:35.840 --> 16:39.510
( <i>garbled shouting )</i>

16:41.010 --> 16:43.780
Bigfoot, the legendary
half man/half ape

16:43.850 --> 16:45.590
is no longer a legend.

16:45.650 --> 16:47.020
He is very real.

16:47.090 --> 16:48.660
Waht you're about to see
is unedited video footage

16:48.720 --> 16:52.630
taken earlier today in the
hills near Tenderfoot Gorge.

16:52.690 --> 16:58.930
( <i>apelike mumbling )</i>

16:59.000 --> 17:00.300
The naturalist

17:00.370 --> 17:02.600
who took these absolutely
extraordinary pictures

17:02.670 --> 17:05.339
was most impressed by
the creature's uncivilized look

17:05.400 --> 17:06.829
its foul language

17:06.900 --> 17:09.800
and, most of all,
its indescribable stench.

17:09.869 --> 17:11.170
A popular supermarket tabloid

17:11.240 --> 17:12.800
has offered a reward of $5,000

17:12.880 --> 17:15.950
to anyone who brings in
the creature alive.

17:16.010 --> 17:19.210
We'll have more on this story
as soon as it develops.

17:19.280 --> 17:21.079
We return you to
the President's address.

17:36.380 --> 17:38.810
IT LOOKS AS IF YOU GIRLS
HAVE BEEN GETTING ALONG ALRIGHT.

17:38.890 --> 17:41.430
BUT IT'S A DARN GOOD THING
WE FOUND YOU WHEN WE DID.

17:41.490 --> 17:43.890
THERE'S SOMETHING HORRIBLE
ROAMING THESE WOODS.

17:43.960 --> 17:44.800
THERE IS?

17:48.330 --> 17:50.830
WHY, THAT'S MY HUSBAND.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.630
HIS NAME ISN'T BIGFOOT.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.270
HIS NAME IS HOMER.

18:02.980 --> 18:04.050
WHAT DOES IT EAT?

18:04.110 --> 18:05.380
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

18:05.450 --> 18:07.080
WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?

18:07.150 --> 18:10.350
WELL, I SUPPOSE
PORK CHOPS ARE HIS FAVORITE.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.300
GET THOSE BEARS
OUT OF HERE.

18:19.360 --> 18:20.860
I'M TRYING TO DO
AN INTERVIEW.

18:20.930 --> 18:22.170
NO BEARS, WE'RE TAPING.

18:22.230 --> 18:24.300
ALL BEARS
OFF THE SET.

18:28.740 --> 18:31.880
NOW LET'S GET BACK
TO YOUR "HUSBAND."

18:31.940 --> 18:34.650
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE
YOUR MARITAL RELATIONS?
BRUTISH?

18:34.710 --> 18:36.210
IS THIS GOING TO BE ON TV?

18:36.280 --> 18:37.080
COAST TO COAST.

18:37.150 --> 18:38.680
( <i>groans )</i>

ARE WE THERE YET?

18:42.120 --> 18:43.650
JUST A LITTLE FURTHER.

ARE WE THERE YET?

( <i>sniffing )</i>

18:50.060 --> 18:51.460
( <i>sniffing )</i>

18:54.100 --> 18:54.900
OHH!

18:57.630 --> 19:01.170
NICE GRIZZLIES,
NICE GRIZZLIES.

19:01.240 --> 19:02.940
NICE GRIZZLIES.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.030
NOW WHAT, DAD?

19:04.110 --> 19:05.380
PRAISE THE GRIZZLIES, SON.

19:05.440 --> 19:07.810
NICE GRIZZLIES, NICE GRIZZLIES.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.680
GOOD GRIZZLY.

19:09.740 --> 19:11.270

MAGGIE!

OH, MY LITTLE GIRL.

19:21.960 --> 19:22.930
Homer:
NICE GRIZZLIES.

19:22.990 --> 19:24.260
NICE GRIZZLIES.

19:25.530 --> 19:26.860
LATER, GRIZZLY-DUDES.

19:43.340 --> 19:44.640
LOOK, IT'S HIM!

19:44.710 --> 19:47.510
IT'S BIGFOOT!

19:47.580 --> 19:48.520
GET HIM!

19:48.580 --> 19:49.540
HUH?

19:49.620 --> 19:50.490
( <i>screaming )</i>

19:50.550 --> 19:51.520
WE GOT HIM!

19:51.590 --> 19:53.220
WE GOT BIGFOOT!

19:53.290 --> 19:55.390
YOU ARE DARN LUCKY
WE GOT HERE IN TIME
TO RESCUE YOU.

19:55.460 --> 19:57.530
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, SIR?

19:58.890 --> 20:00.590
HE'S GETTING AWAY.

20:00.660 --> 20:02.830
WE GOTTA TAKE HIM ALIVE.
JOHNSON, YOU GOT THAT
TRANQUILIZER GUN READY?

20:06.370 --> 20:07.870
( <i>shrieking )</i>

20:07.940 --> 20:09.510
( <i>screaming )</i>

20:12.370 --> 20:14.130
DAD! OH, DAD!

20:14.210 --> 20:16.150
AVENGE ME, SON.

20:16.210 --> 20:18.780
AVENGE MY DEATH.

20:18.850 --> 20:20.820
( <i>snoring )</i>

20:23.080 --> 20:24.280
Last week's capture of Bigfoot

20:24.350 --> 20:26.860
turned into the scientific poser
of the century.

20:26.920 --> 20:28.590
Although the creature
was ultimately released

20:28.660 --> 20:31.960
the question remains:
Who was this Homer?

20:32.030 --> 20:35.830
Was it a man, or was it
in fact, the legendary
missing link known as Bigfoot?

20:35.900 --> 20:37.670
CAN I HAVE
SOME APPLESAUCE?

20:37.730 --> 20:39.670
SPECIALISTS
FROM AROUND THE WORLD

20:39.730 --> 20:42.360
GATHERED AT THE SPRINGWOOD
PRIMATE INSTITUTE

20:42.440 --> 20:44.170
TO EXAMINE
THE CONTROVERSIAL CREATURE.

20:44.240 --> 20:45.910
HERE ARE THEIR FINDINGS.

20:45.970 --> 20:47.300
( <i>chattering )</i>

20:47.380 --> 20:49.680
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
DISTINGUISHED COLLEAGUES:

20:49.740 --> 20:53.770
AFTER EXTENSIVE BIOLOGICAL
AND ANATOMICAL TESTING

20:53.850 --> 20:57.020
I REGRET TO ANNOUNCE
THAT THE EVIDENCE WE HAVE IS...

20:57.080 --> 20:59.380
INCONCLUSIVE.

20:59.450 --> 21:02.480
THIS THING
MAY OR MAY NOT BE HUMAN.

21:02.560 --> 21:03.760
( <i>muttering )</i>

21:03.830 --> 21:05.100
THAT'S WHAT HE THINKS.

21:05.160 --> 21:08.370
I SAY IT IS NONE OTHER
THAN BIGFOOT IN THE FLESH.

21:08.430 --> 21:09.770
( French accent )
OH NO, I DISAGREE,
I THINK IT IS A MAN.

21:09.830 --> 21:12.640
THE EYES HAD A GLIMMER
OF HUMAN INTELLIGENCE.

21:12.700 --> 21:16.940
WHAT ABOUT THE SLOPING
APELIKE FOREHEAD?

21:17.000 --> 21:19.900
Homer:
THE GUYS AT WORK WILL HAVE
A FIELD DAY WITH THIS.

21:19.970 --> 21:22.270
CHEER UP, HOMER.
AT LEAST THEY LET YOU GO.

21:22.340 --> 21:25.840
