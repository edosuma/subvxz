00:37.990 --> 00:40.030
...and I'll tell you what,
the storm system's still moving west.

00:40.120 --> 00:43.120
What are you looking at, Caroline?

00:44.120 --> 00:45.750
The wind, Mom.

00:48.790 --> 00:51.250
They say the hurricane is coming.

00:52.880 --> 00:56.050
I'm on a boat.

00:56.130 --> 00:58.470
I'm drifting.

01:00.760 --> 01:03.100
Can I do anything for you, Mom?

01:04.430 --> 01:06.310
Make anything easier?

01:07.270 --> 01:08.690
Oh, sugar...

01:09.190 --> 01:11.480
There's nothing left to do.

01:11.980 --> 01:13.610
Is what it is.

01:15.070 --> 01:18.070
Finding it harder to keep my eyes open.

01:19.990 --> 01:23.160
My mouth's full of cotton.

01:23.660 --> 01:25.830
There, there, Miss Daisy.

01:25.910 --> 01:28.670
You gonna scratch yourself to ribbons.

01:33.550 --> 01:36.380
Do you want any more
medication, Mother?

01:37.260 --> 01:40.470
Doctor said you could have
as much as you want.

01:40.550 --> 01:42.850
No need for anybody to suffer.

01:57.820 --> 02:00.740
A friend told me
that she never had the chance

02:00.820 --> 02:03.160
to say goodbye to her mother.

02:06.250 --> 02:08.620
- I wanted to...
- It's okay.

02:08.710 --> 02:12.250
I wanted to tell you
how much I'm gonna miss you so...

02:12.710 --> 02:13.840
Mom.

02:15.800 --> 02:17.590
Oh, Caroline.

02:23.390 --> 02:24.890
Are you afraid?

02:24.970 --> 02:26.720
I'm curious.

02:28.430 --> 02:30.100
What comes next?

02:35.610 --> 02:40.400
They built the train station in 1918.

02:41.410 --> 02:44.200
My father was there the day it opened.

02:45.830 --> 02:48.580
He said they had

02:50.460 --> 02:51.790
a tuba band playing.

02:56.550 --> 03:00.630
They had the finest clockmaker
in all of the South

03:01.220 --> 03:04.050
to build that glorious clock.

03:05.890 --> 03:07.470
His name was...

03:09.350 --> 03:11.190
Mr. Gateau.

03:15.520 --> 03:16.730
Mr. Cake.

03:19.280 --> 03:23.450
He was married to a Creole
of Evangeline Parish

03:23.530 --> 03:25.780
and they had a son.

03:27.700 --> 03:32.830
Mr. Gateau was, from birth,
absolutely blind.

03:35.080 --> 03:39.340
When their son was old enough,
he joined the army.

03:40.260 --> 03:44.640
And they prayed God would
keep him out of harm's way.

03:47.560 --> 03:52.310
For months,
he did nothing but work on that clock.

03:56.360 --> 03:57.810
One day,

03:59.150 --> 04:01.110
a letter came.

04:06.320 --> 04:10.080
And Mr. Gateau, done for the night,

04:10.750 --> 04:13.290
went up, alone, to bed.

04:15.920 --> 04:18.750
And their son came home.

04:23.880 --> 04:26.720
They buried him in the family plot,

04:26.800 --> 04:30.720
where he would be with them
when their time came.

04:32.680 --> 04:35.850
Mr. Cake worked on his clock,

04:38.690 --> 04:42.320
laboring to finish.

04:44.200 --> 04:47.530
It was a morning to remember.

04:48.830 --> 04:51.990
Papa said
there were people everywhere.

04:53.370 --> 04:56.000
Even Teddy Roosevelt came.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.600
It's running backwards!

05:17.230 --> 05:18.980
I made it that way

05:20.570 --> 05:22.440
so that perhaps the boys
that we lost in the war

05:22.530 --> 05:23.900
might stand and come home again.

05:28.780 --> 05:30.240
Home to farm,

05:31.330 --> 05:32.580
work,

05:34.080 --> 05:35.830
have children.

05:39.080 --> 05:41.590
To live long, full lives.

05:44.760 --> 05:47.470
Perhaps my own son
might come home again.

05:56.100 --> 05:58.690
I'm sorry if I've offended anybody.

06:00.230 --> 06:02.520
I hope you enjoy my clock.

06:03.400 --> 06:07.280
Mr. Cake was never seen again.

06:11.620 --> 06:16.080
Some say he died of a broken heart.

06:17.790 --> 06:20.120
Some say he went to sea.

06:25.210 --> 06:26.380
Excuse me.

06:26.460 --> 06:29.050
Do you mind if I make a call?
Somebody's watching my little boy.

06:29.130 --> 06:30.430
Sure.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.900
I hope I haven't disappointed you.

06:42.980 --> 06:46.110
You couldn't disappoint me.

06:47.530 --> 06:52.450
Well, I know I don't have much
to show for myself.

06:54.990 --> 06:57.450
Find my dark suitcase.

07:01.790 --> 07:04.710
There's a diary.

07:06.840 --> 07:07.960
This?

07:10.680 --> 07:13.590
Could you read it to me?

07:14.050 --> 07:16.390
Is this what you want to do?

07:16.470 --> 07:20.390
I tried to read it
a hundred different times.

07:21.350 --> 07:23.350
Mom, it's not exactly...

07:23.440 --> 07:26.860
It's just the sound of your voice, darling.

07:27.480 --> 07:28.690
Okay.

07:31.820 --> 07:34.820
It's dated April 4th, 1985.

07:35.910 --> 07:38.290
And it says New Orleans.

07:38.370 --> 07:41.120
"This is my last will and testament.

07:41.210 --> 07:45.420
"I don't have much to leave,
few possessions, no money, really.

07:45.790 --> 07:51.050
"I will go out of this world the same way
I came in, alone and with nothing.

07:51.720 --> 07:53.590
"All I have is my story,

07:53.680 --> 07:57.100
"and I'm writing it now
while I still remember it.

07:57.890 --> 08:01.060
"My name is Benjamin.
Benjamin Button."

08:01.390 --> 08:04.560
And I was born under
unusual circumstances.

08:05.480 --> 08:07.730
The First World War had ended,

08:08.400 --> 08:12.320
and I've been told it was
an especially good night to be born.

08:13.910 --> 08:16.110
Thank God it's over!

08:16.200 --> 08:18.030
We won the war!

08:32.919 --> 08:34.760
The Great War is over!

08:46.980 --> 08:48.020
What are you doing here?

08:48.110 --> 08:49.440
Thomas,

08:50.650 --> 08:52.110
I'm afraid she's going to die.

08:52.190 --> 08:53.400
What?

08:54.530 --> 08:58.200
That's enough.
All of you, get away from her.

09:01.370 --> 09:04.500
I came as quickly as I could.
The streets are filled with people.

09:04.580 --> 09:05.870
Thomas.

09:06.330 --> 09:08.960
Promise me he has a place.

09:11.340 --> 09:12.500
Yeah.

09:13.840 --> 09:15.880
She gave her life for me.

09:16.880 --> 09:19.890
And for that, I am forever grateful.

09:29.480 --> 09:30.900
Mr. Button.

09:46.160 --> 09:47.410
Thomas!

09:47.500 --> 09:48.790
Thomas.

09:50.750 --> 09:52.960
Thomas? Where are you going?

10:21.530 --> 10:23.910
Hey! What are you doing there?

10:25.120 --> 10:27.200
What do you have there?

11:24.800 --> 11:27.180
- Come on, Queenie.
- Now, Mr. Weathers!

11:27.260 --> 11:30.640
Come on, now, you know I ain't got
nothing but work to do around here.

11:30.730 --> 11:33.020
- Come on. Just take some time.
- Stop all this foolishness.

11:36.190 --> 11:37.980
The air is sweet.

11:42.410 --> 11:45.490
You look very handsome tonight,
Miss Queenie.

11:46.780 --> 11:48.950
Handsome as I've ever seen.

11:50.370 --> 11:52.620
The brown matches your eyes.

11:52.710 --> 11:54.080
Oh, hush!

11:55.500 --> 11:59.670
Let's see here.
You ain't no slouch yourself.

12:08.220 --> 12:10.060
Hambert's back in town.

12:10.140 --> 12:13.940
He came home legless, but he's home.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.560
I know you were sweet on him one time.

12:18.070 --> 12:19.940
Sweeter than I should've been.

12:20.030 --> 12:21.940
Miss Simone messed herself.

12:22.030 --> 12:23.280
Oh, sweet Jesus.

12:23.360 --> 12:25.910
She got to stop doing that
or it's diapers for her.

12:25.990 --> 12:28.070
- I'll be right there, Miss Jameson!
- Now, Queenie, now come on.

12:28.160 --> 12:30.740
Okay, Queenie'll be right there.

12:30.830 --> 12:32.080
It's awful nice out here.

12:32.160 --> 12:35.420
Come on out back for a moment.
Take your mind off things.

12:35.500 --> 12:36.540
You're so bad.

12:36.630 --> 12:39.130
- What in God's name?
- What's this?

12:49.470 --> 12:51.720
Oh, the Lord done something here.

12:51.810 --> 12:55.310
Hope I didn't hurt it none
stepping on it like that.

12:55.390 --> 12:56.940
We best leave that for the police.

12:57.020 --> 12:58.560
Poor baby.

12:59.360 --> 13:00.730
I'll go.

13:01.360 --> 13:05.070
It's for sure nobody wanted to keep it.
Come on, baby.

13:07.700 --> 13:10.160
Queenie? Where are you, Queenie?

13:10.240 --> 13:12.200
Hold your water! You go deal with it.

13:12.290 --> 13:14.410
Okay. No, go, I'll be back.

13:15.250 --> 13:18.540
Queenie, Apple, she went and messed
herself all over again!

13:18.630 --> 13:20.500
Jane Childress, start her a bath!

13:20.590 --> 13:22.670
And mind your own business,
Mrs. Duprey.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.590
You'll be messing yourself
soon enough.

13:24.670 --> 13:26.260
Somebody stole my necklace.

13:26.340 --> 13:29.300
Okay. All right, Mrs. Hollister,
I'll be right with you, okay?

13:29.390 --> 13:31.600
Go on back upstairs, hear?

13:37.900 --> 13:40.440
You are as ugly as an old pot

13:40.520 --> 13:42.190
but you're still a child of God.

13:42.270 --> 13:44.650
Queenie, Apple,
she won't take a bath without you!

13:44.740 --> 13:46.240
Mercy.

13:46.320 --> 13:48.320
I'll be right there!

13:51.330 --> 13:54.290
Okay. You just wait right here
for me now, okay?

13:57.580 --> 14:02.250
My sister gave me those pearls.
I can't find them anywhere.

14:02.340 --> 14:06.170
- Somebody's been stealing my jewelry.
- They're right here, Mrs. Hollister. See?

14:06.260 --> 14:09.590
Right around your pretty white neck.
Now, come on. Hush all that noise.

14:09.680 --> 14:12.300
- Is Dr. Rose still here?
- I don't know.

14:15.100 --> 14:16.390
Your heart is strong.

14:16.480 --> 14:19.480
You just want to avoid
any undue stimulation.

14:20.060 --> 14:23.190
I trust you ladies
will help me out with that?

14:23.270 --> 14:26.440
I have something.
Could you come downstairs?

14:30.110 --> 14:33.830
Never seen anything like it.
Nearly blind from cataracts.

14:33.910 --> 14:38.000
I'm not sure if he can hear.
His bones indicate severe arthritis.

14:38.790 --> 14:43.210
His skin has lost all elasticity,
and his hands and feet are ossified.

14:43.290 --> 14:47.880
He shows all the deterioration,
the infirmities, not of a newborn,

14:47.970 --> 14:50.630
but of a man well in his 80s
on his way to the grave.

14:50.720 --> 14:51.720
He's dying?

14:51.800 --> 14:55.100
His body is failing him
before his life's begun.

14:57.430 --> 14:58.890
Where'd he come from?

14:58.980 --> 15:03.350
My sister's child. From Lafayette.
She had an unfortunate adventure.

15:03.440 --> 15:07.360
The poor child, he got the worst of it.
Come out white.

15:10.360 --> 15:14.990
There are places for unwanted babies
like these, Queenie.

15:15.620 --> 15:18.290
No room for another mouth to feed here.

15:18.370 --> 15:20.910
The Nolan Foundation,
despite their good intentions,

15:21.000 --> 15:23.790
thinks this place is
a large nuisance as it is.

15:23.880 --> 15:26.090
- A baby...
- You said he don't have long.

15:26.170 --> 15:30.760
Queenie, some creatures
aren't meant to survive.

15:34.140 --> 15:37.890
No, this baby, he is a miracle.
That's for certain.

15:37.970 --> 15:41.020
Just not the kind of miracle
one hopes to see.

15:44.020 --> 15:46.520
Y'all listen. Y'all listen up here.

15:47.270 --> 15:48.320
We're gonna have us a visitor

15:48.400 --> 15:51.530
that's gonna be staying with us
for a little while.

15:51.610 --> 15:55.370
My sister had a child
and she couldn't see right by it, so...

15:57.580 --> 15:59.370
He's known as...

16:02.580 --> 16:05.880
Benjamin.

16:06.750 --> 16:09.710
He's not a well child, so we're gonna
have to take good care of him.

16:09.800 --> 16:10.880
I had 10 children.

16:10.970 --> 16:14.340
There's not a baby I can't care for.
Let me see him.

16:16.510 --> 16:20.180
God in Heaven.
He looks just like my ex-husband.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.640
Look, he's prematurely old.

16:24.100 --> 16:27.690
Dr. Rose said he ain't got much more
time on this earth.

16:27.980 --> 16:29.150
Join the club.

16:34.240 --> 16:35.740
He's smiling!

16:42.450 --> 16:45.160
Hambert sends his
remembrances to you.

16:54.930 --> 16:57.300
Are you right out of your mind?

16:58.600 --> 17:01.970
I know you ain't got all the parts
it takes to make one of your own,

17:02.060 --> 17:03.310
but this ain't yours to keep.

17:03.390 --> 17:05.690
It may not even be humankind.

17:14.780 --> 17:17.240
Mr. Weathers, come back here.

17:19.530 --> 17:20.780
Please.

17:37.130 --> 17:39.720
You never know what's coming for you.

17:49.690 --> 17:52.110
It seemed I had found a home.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.320
Is any of this true?

17:56.400 --> 17:59.820
You have such a lovely voice.

18:00.320 --> 18:05.040
Mom, it's an ancient streetcar token.

18:06.710 --> 18:09.870
That clock just kept going,

18:10.830 --> 18:15.090
year after year after year.

18:19.340 --> 18:21.260
But I didn't know I was a child.

18:21.350 --> 18:23.850
Same old crap every day.

18:24.720 --> 18:27.520
I thought I was like everyone else there.

18:28.520 --> 18:30.690
An old man in the twilight of his life.

18:30.770 --> 18:33.150
Could you make him stop that?

18:34.110 --> 18:37.190
Stop banging that fork.
It's used for eating, not for playing with.

18:37.280 --> 18:40.150
And use your napkin, please,
Mr. Benjamin.

18:42.490 --> 18:43.780
Queenie!

18:55.840 --> 18:57.170
Hey, boy.

19:04.510 --> 19:06.850
Always had a healthy curiosity.

19:07.980 --> 19:11.480
What was up the street?
Or around the next corner?

19:13.310 --> 19:14.650
Go get him!

19:14.730 --> 19:18.440
Benjamin! That is dangerous.
Come back over here.

19:19.150 --> 19:20.900
Stay put, child.

19:23.240 --> 19:25.240
I loved her very much.

19:25.990 --> 19:27.660
She was my mother.

19:27.740 --> 19:30.750
Mama.

19:31.540 --> 19:35.330
Some days I feel different
than the day before.

19:36.750 --> 19:40.800
Everybody feels different about
themselves, one way or another.

19:41.760 --> 19:44.090
But we're all going the same way.

19:45.430 --> 19:49.100
Just taking different roads to get there,
that's all.

19:49.180 --> 19:51.680
You're on your own road, Benjamin.

19:54.440 --> 19:57.110
Mama? How much longer I got?

19:57.610 --> 20:00.900
Just be thankful
for what you're given, hear?

20:00.990 --> 20:04.110
You're already here longer
than you're supposed to.

20:06.950 --> 20:09.910
Some nights, I'd have to sleep alone.

20:18.590 --> 20:20.300
I didn't mind.

20:21.130 --> 20:23.930
I would listen to the house breathing.

20:25.090 --> 20:27.180
All those people sleeping.

20:28.640 --> 20:30.850
I felt safe.

20:51.660 --> 20:54.290
It was a place of great routine.

20:54.370 --> 20:57.290
Every morning at 5:30,
no matter the weather,

20:57.380 --> 21:01.500
General Winslow, U. S. Army, Retired,
would raise the flag.

21:04.340 --> 21:08.300
Mrs. Sybil Wagner,
once an opera singer of some note,

21:08.390 --> 21:11.060
well, she sang Wagner.

21:22.860 --> 21:24.280
All right, baby, come on.

21:24.360 --> 21:28.240
We got to put some life
into these old sticks for you.

21:28.320 --> 21:32.660
Get you walking so you can help me out
around here. Come on now, hear?

21:33.700 --> 21:37.580
No matter the season,
supper was served promptly at 5:30.

21:37.670 --> 21:44.010
Molasses.

21:44.920 --> 21:47.510
I learned to read when I was five.

21:48.550 --> 21:51.970
My grandfather was a dresser
for a famous actor.

21:52.060 --> 21:54.810
He brung home every play
for me to read.

21:57.020 --> 22:00.770
"Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,

22:01.690 --> 22:05.320
"Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.

22:06.070 --> 22:08.820
"Even like a man
new haled from the rack,

22:08.910 --> 22:11.620
"So fare my limbs
with long imprisonment.

22:12.330 --> 22:16.000
"And these gray locks,
the pursuivants of death,

22:16.580 --> 22:19.580
"Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer."

22:23.460 --> 22:26.550
You thought I was plain ignorant,
didn't you?

22:26.630 --> 22:30.300
The actor my grandfather worked for
was John Wilkes Booth.

22:32.600 --> 22:34.640
He killed Abraham Lincoln.

22:36.390 --> 22:39.060
You never know what's coming for you.

22:39.730 --> 22:43.360
On Saturday nights,
Mama would make me go to church.

22:47.110 --> 22:48.530
Benjamin!

22:59.620 --> 23:01.210
- Amen! Amen!
- Amen! Amen!

23:03.000 --> 23:05.380
What can I do for you, sister?

23:15.180 --> 23:20.680
Her parts are all twisted up inside
and she can't have little children.

23:24.480 --> 23:28.530
Lord, if you could see clear
to forgive this woman her sins

23:28.610 --> 23:30.740
so she can bear the fruit of the womb.

23:30.820 --> 23:33.240
Out, damnable affliction!

23:33.320 --> 23:35.490
- Praise God!
- Praise God!

23:35.580 --> 23:36.740
Hallelujah!

23:36.830 --> 23:38.330
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

23:40.370 --> 23:43.170
And what's this old man's irrediction?

23:44.840 --> 23:46.250
He's got the Devil on his back,

23:46.340 --> 23:49.670
trying to ride him into the grave
before his time.

23:52.930 --> 23:54.390
- Out, Zebuchar!
- Yes!

23:54.470 --> 23:56.350
- Out, Beelzebub!
- Yes!

23:58.180 --> 23:59.930
How old are you?

24:00.020 --> 24:02.560
Seven. But I look a lot older.

24:03.600 --> 24:05.150
God bless you.

24:05.690 --> 24:07.190
He's seven.

24:09.990 --> 24:13.950
Now, this is a man
with optimism in his heart.

24:14.030 --> 24:15.740
- All right.
- Belief in his soul!

24:15.820 --> 24:16.820
- Yes!
- Yes!

24:16.910 --> 24:18.740
We are all children in the eyes of God!

24:18.830 --> 24:20.120
- Yes!
- Hallelujah!

24:20.200 --> 24:23.120
We are gonna get you out of that chair.

24:23.210 --> 24:25.250
- And we're gonna have you walk.
- Amen.

24:26.080 --> 24:27.710
It's all right.

24:28.590 --> 24:30.840
In the name of God's glory...

24:31.670 --> 24:33.130
Rise up!

24:34.590 --> 24:36.010
Come on.

24:37.800 --> 24:39.600
Come on. Walk.

24:39.680 --> 24:41.140
Come on, son. Come on.

24:41.220 --> 24:43.980
- Come on with it, son. Come on.
- Come on.

24:44.060 --> 24:47.440
Now God is gonna see you
the rest of the way.

24:47.520 --> 24:52.320
He's gonna see this little old man walk
without the use of a crutch or a cane.

24:52.400 --> 24:54.240
He's gonna see that you walk
from faith...

24:54.320 --> 24:57.320
- Hallelujah!
...and divine inspiration alone!

24:57.410 --> 24:58.570
- Yes.
- Hey, Ben!

24:58.660 --> 24:59.990
- Go, son!
- Now walk.

25:00.080 --> 25:01.330
- Yes.
- Come on.

25:03.410 --> 25:05.080
Don't touch him.

25:07.420 --> 25:09.210
Rise up, old man.

25:10.250 --> 25:12.840
Rise up like Lazarus.

25:12.920 --> 25:15.090
I said, rise up!

25:15.720 --> 25:17.090
Hallelujah!

25:19.260 --> 25:20.470
Yes.

25:20.930 --> 25:22.140
Come on.

25:22.220 --> 25:23.220
Say hallelujah.

25:23.310 --> 25:24.730
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

25:26.440 --> 25:27.650
Walk.

25:28.440 --> 25:30.520
Walk on. Yes.

25:34.360 --> 25:35.400
That's right, Benjamin.

25:35.490 --> 25:38.740
Now when I look back on it,
it was miraculous.

25:38.820 --> 25:42.910
But you know the saying, the Lord
giveth and the Lord taketh away.

25:43.120 --> 25:45.040
Glory in the highest!

25:49.130 --> 25:50.290
Sweet Jesus!

25:50.420 --> 25:51.540
- No!
- No!

25:53.960 --> 25:55.340
There were so many birthdays.

25:55.420 --> 25:58.970
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow...

25:59.050 --> 26:01.680
So we wouldn't run out,
we would spare the candles.

26:01.760 --> 26:05.810
Queenie, you know I don't like birthdays
and I don't like cake.

26:06.480 --> 26:10.480
And death was a common visitor.
People came and went.

26:12.270 --> 26:14.690
You always knew
when someone left us.

26:14.780 --> 26:17.320
There was a silence in the house.

26:31.330 --> 26:33.630
It was a wonderful place to grow up.

26:33.710 --> 26:38.220
I was with people who had shed
all the inconsequences of earlier life.

26:38.880 --> 26:43.010
Left wondering about the weather,
the temperature of a bath,

26:44.220 --> 26:46.470
the light at the end of a day.

26:50.850 --> 26:54.860
For everyone that died, someone would
come to take their place.

26:55.860 --> 26:58.190
I've been married five times.

26:58.700 --> 27:02.410
My fifth wife and I are captured
by a neighbor tribe of cannibals.

27:02.490 --> 27:03.570
Oh, goodness gracious.

27:03.660 --> 27:05.120
We escaped across the river.

27:05.200 --> 27:08.620
My wife, she can't swim,
so, sadly, she eaten.

27:08.710 --> 27:09.910
Oh, my God.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.880
My second wife steps on cobra
and dies.

27:13.380 --> 27:16.170
It was very bad luck
to be married to me.

27:16.250 --> 27:19.300
That's Mr. Oti. He's an acquaintance
of an acquaintance of mine.

27:19.380 --> 27:21.510
- The next summer I'm captured...
- He's a Pygmy.

27:21.590 --> 27:23.470
...with three others
by the Baschiele tribe.

27:23.550 --> 27:28.470
They trade us for pigs, shoes, and beer
to a very strange American man.

27:47.580 --> 27:50.080
I hear you're not so old
as you're looking.

27:50.160 --> 27:52.410
You just fooling everybody.

27:52.960 --> 27:56.000
What's the matter?
Did you get Madjembe?

27:56.090 --> 27:57.500
What's Madjembe?

27:57.590 --> 27:58.920
Worms.

27:59.260 --> 28:01.590
I don't think I have worms.

28:02.220 --> 28:03.760
This is just how I am.

28:03.840 --> 28:06.720
- Did you take your pills today?
- No, ma'am.

28:06.810 --> 28:09.180
Come. Let's get a cold root beer.

28:09.270 --> 28:11.390
I found the medication
under your pillow.

28:11.480 --> 28:14.690
I'm not supposed to. It's dangerous.

28:14.770 --> 28:17.520
Who said that? Come on, little man.

28:18.780 --> 28:20.480
Hello, children.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.250
Hold, please.

28:35.880 --> 28:40.210
Then I'm in the monkey house
at Philadelphia Zoological Park.

28:41.090 --> 28:44.630
Three thousand people
show up my first day.

28:45.930 --> 28:46.970
Look.

28:48.720 --> 28:50.640
What's it like living in a cage?

28:50.720 --> 28:52.220
It stinks.

28:52.810 --> 28:55.140
But the monkeys.

28:55.900 --> 28:57.980
They do some tricks there.

28:58.150 --> 29:00.900
I throw a spear, wrestle with Kowali.

29:01.690 --> 29:03.490
She is orangutan.

29:03.860 --> 29:07.410
When I'm not playing with the monkeys,
they want me to run to the bars

29:07.490 --> 29:09.660
in my cage, with my teeth.

29:19.540 --> 29:21.630
So then what'd you do?

29:21.710 --> 29:27.590
Then I leave zoo, go here, go there.
Wandered most of the time.

29:28.010 --> 29:29.090
You were all alone?

29:29.180 --> 29:31.470
Plenty of time you'll be alone.

29:31.560 --> 29:35.020
When you're different like us,
it's gonna be that way.

29:38.020 --> 29:39.900
But I'll tell you a little secret.

29:39.980 --> 29:43.280
Fat people, skinny people, tall people,

29:43.360 --> 29:46.400
white people,
they're just as alone as we are.

29:46.910 --> 29:49.160
But they're scared shitless.

29:55.330 --> 29:58.000
I think about the river I grew up on.

29:58.420 --> 30:01.380
It would be nice to sit by my river again.

30:03.590 --> 30:06.010
Come, I have an appointment.

30:08.380 --> 30:10.970
There's my little man.
You ready, sugar?

30:11.050 --> 30:13.390
Always ready. Always ready.

30:15.180 --> 30:17.310
Filamena, Mr. Benjamin.

30:18.310 --> 30:21.400
- It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
- My pleasure, ma'am.

30:21.480 --> 30:23.480
You can find your own way home,
can't you?

30:23.570 --> 30:26.320
Take the St. Charles line to Napoleon.

30:32.280 --> 30:33.910
Hey! Hey!

30:54.220 --> 30:57.770
Where in God's name have you been?
Get in here.

30:59.230 --> 31:02.520
I mean, you take my breath away,
you know that?

31:02.900 --> 31:05.520
Oh, Lord, I was so worried about you.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.780
It had been the best day of my life.

31:12.700 --> 31:15.410
- How's her breathing?
- It's shallow.

31:15.490 --> 31:17.040
They say it'll reach us in a few hours,

31:17.120 --> 31:20.040
so I gotta get my baby
and take him to my sister's.

31:20.120 --> 31:22.620
They say there's nothing to worry about
here in the hospital.

31:22.710 --> 31:25.210
Nurses'll be right here if you need them.
Are you okay?

31:25.300 --> 31:29.090
- Yeah, I'm okay reading.
- I shouldn't be more than an hour.

31:30.470 --> 31:33.140
Was there just company?

31:33.640 --> 31:36.100
It was just Dorothy leaving.

31:38.220 --> 31:39.680
Go on, Caroline.

31:39.770 --> 31:42.900
"On Sundays, the families would come
and visit."

31:43.270 --> 31:46.230
It was Thanksgiving, 1930.

31:46.320 --> 31:49.320
I met the person
who changed my life forever.

32:01.330 --> 32:03.460
Well, Benjamin.

32:03.830 --> 32:07.170
Might I say you are looking
strikingly youthful.

32:07.630 --> 32:09.210
Good day, Mrs. Fuller.

32:09.300 --> 32:12.590
A single cane,
back straight as an arrow.

32:12.680 --> 32:15.050
What elixir have you been drinking?

32:15.140 --> 32:18.510
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Grandma! Look at me!

32:20.930 --> 32:23.270
That was really something.

32:23.350 --> 32:25.270
Come on over here, you.

32:25.360 --> 32:28.190
Now, this is my granddaughter, Daisy.

32:29.110 --> 32:30.980
This is Mr...

32:31.070 --> 32:34.780
I'm afraid, Benjamin,
I don't rightly know your last name.

32:34.860 --> 32:36.530
Benjamin's fine.

32:37.120 --> 32:39.490
I never forgot her blue eyes.

32:39.870 --> 32:42.580
Good people, supper is served.

32:42.660 --> 32:48.790
Health and food, for love and friends.
For everything thy goodness sends.

32:49.210 --> 32:50.380
Amen.

32:50.460 --> 32:51.710
- Amen!
- Amen!

32:55.390 --> 32:57.970
Did you know turkeys aren't really birds?

32:58.050 --> 32:59.140
Why do you say that?

32:59.220 --> 33:02.350
They're in the pheasant family,
can't hardly fly.

33:02.430 --> 33:04.980
It's sad, don't you think?
Birds that can't fly?

33:05.060 --> 33:07.270
I love birds that can't fly.

33:07.360 --> 33:09.400
They are so delicious.

33:10.530 --> 33:12.990
- That's terrible.
- I have something to tell y'all

33:13.070 --> 33:16.280
while we're giving thanks
for God's blessings.

33:16.360 --> 33:18.320
I had a miracle happen.

33:18.780 --> 33:21.450
The Lord saw fit to answer my prayers.

33:25.120 --> 33:27.460
What does she mean,
answered her prayers?

33:27.540 --> 33:29.080
Thanks. Thank you.

33:29.170 --> 33:31.590
She's gonna have a baby, silly.

33:32.510 --> 33:35.510
That's what my mama said
when I was gonna have a baby brother,

33:35.590 --> 33:37.930
but he didn't live long,

33:39.100 --> 33:41.470
'cause he didn't breathe right.

33:44.310 --> 33:48.350
"In the afternoon, when he had got
his beautiful hind legs

33:48.440 --> 33:52.070
"just as Big God Nqong had promised.

33:52.900 --> 33:55.110
"You can see that it is 5:00,

33:55.190 --> 33:59.200
"because Big God Nqong's
clock says so."

33:59.280 --> 34:01.120
Isn't that something?

34:01.660 --> 34:03.040
Again, read it again.

34:03.120 --> 34:05.450
Oh, read it again, please.

34:05.540 --> 34:08.870
All right.
But afterwards, you must go to bed.

34:09.210 --> 34:10.630
I promise.

34:12.590 --> 34:14.460
"Old Man Kangaroo."

34:18.719 --> 34:20.429
Are you sleeping?

34:21.929 --> 34:23.429
Who's that?

34:23.510 --> 34:25.139
It's me, Daisy.

34:26.139 --> 34:27.639
Oh, hi!

34:28.190 --> 34:29.730
'Kay, come on.

34:40.820 --> 34:42.620
Where are we going?

34:43.739 --> 34:46.580
Come on. Under here.

34:56.090 --> 34:57.550
Here, you light it.

34:57.630 --> 34:59.760
I'm not supposed to play with matches.

34:59.840 --> 35:02.140
Don't be a chicken. Light it.

35:13.190 --> 35:16.150
I'll tell you a secret if you'll tell me one.

35:16.230 --> 35:17.690
Okay.

35:17.780 --> 35:21.150
I saw my mama kissing another man.

35:21.530 --> 35:23.620
Her face was red from it.

35:25.870 --> 35:27.370
Your turn.

35:30.670 --> 35:32.960
I'm not as old as I look.

35:33.040 --> 35:34.670
I thought so.

35:36.590 --> 35:39.050
You don't seem like an old person.

35:39.720 --> 35:41.880
- Like my grandma.
- I'm not.

35:43.640 --> 35:45.260
Are you sick?

35:45.810 --> 35:48.970
Well, I heard Mama
and Tizzy whispering.

35:49.060 --> 35:53.270
They said I was gonna die soon,
but maybe not.

35:55.480 --> 35:57.070
You're odd.

35:57.780 --> 36:00.690
You're different
than anybody I've ever met.

36:03.820 --> 36:06.030
- May I?
- Okay.

36:13.250 --> 36:15.670
What are you doing under there?

36:15.750 --> 36:19.210
You come right out here
and get back up to bed!

36:19.300 --> 36:21.090
It's after midnight!

36:21.170 --> 36:23.300
You are not to be playing together.

36:23.380 --> 36:24.930
Yes, ma'am.

36:25.010 --> 36:27.180
Now you get back to bed, little lady.

36:27.260 --> 36:31.270
You're too young to be wandering
around in the night on your own.

36:33.940 --> 36:37.770
And you ought
to be ashamed of yourself.

36:53.040 --> 36:55.120
You are a different child.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.000
A man-child.

36:57.080 --> 37:01.590
And, baby, people aren't gonna
understand just how different you are.

37:07.850 --> 37:10.060
What's wrong with me, Mama?

37:10.970 --> 37:12.770
Come here.

37:14.890 --> 37:17.150
God hasn't said yet, baby.

37:21.570 --> 37:25.110
Now go on to bed, hear?
And behave yourself.

37:26.410 --> 37:28.990
Go on. Say your prayers, hear?

37:40.800 --> 37:44.880
Did I ever tell you I've been struck
by lightning seven times?

37:47.180 --> 37:50.140
Once when I was repairing
a leak on the roof.

37:54.180 --> 37:57.480
Once I was just crossing
the road to get the mail.

38:13.490 --> 38:14.790
I never forgot her...

38:14.870 --> 38:16.410
"...blue eyes."

38:17.870 --> 38:19.460
Mom?

38:19.540 --> 38:24.340
Did you get that this Benjamin loved you
from the first time that he saw you?

38:25.550 --> 38:28.050
Not many people experience that.

38:29.510 --> 38:31.300
Want me to go on?

38:33.260 --> 38:35.310
He crosses something out.

38:35.390 --> 38:38.690
When that baby came,
things were different.

38:38.770 --> 38:42.150
Your mama gone away
And your daddy gonna stay

38:42.230 --> 38:46.070
Didn't leave nobody but the baby

38:47.490 --> 38:50.110
Babies were born, people died.

38:50.990 --> 38:53.870
A lot of folks been through
that old house.

38:55.790 --> 38:59.040
I've come to say goodbye.
I'm going away.

38:59.120 --> 39:00.420
Going?

39:00.920 --> 39:02.460
Where?

39:02.540 --> 39:04.130
I haven't figured that out yet,

39:04.210 --> 39:06.670
but I'll send you a postcard
when I get there.

39:06.760 --> 39:09.550
What about your friend, the tall lady?

39:09.630 --> 39:11.050
We are not friends anymore.

39:11.140 --> 39:14.430
That's what happens
with tall people sometimes.

39:14.510 --> 39:17.310
Well, goodbye.

39:36.580 --> 39:39.370
Spent a lot of time by myself that year.

39:40.710 --> 39:41.960
Hello?

39:43.710 --> 39:45.500
- Hi.
- I'm moving in today.

39:45.590 --> 39:48.420
Welcome. We've been expecting you.

39:48.510 --> 39:51.550
Can you please show her up
to Mrs. Rousseau's old room?

39:51.630 --> 39:55.010
I'm sorry, but we usually
don't allow dogs in the house.

39:55.100 --> 39:58.100
Well, she's old as the hills.
She's almost blind.

39:58.180 --> 40:01.140
She won't be a bother much longer.

40:01.230 --> 40:04.940
Well, all right,
long as she stays from up underfoot.

40:05.020 --> 40:06.230
Right this way, ma'am.

40:06.320 --> 40:09.480
As hard as I try,
I can't remember her name.

40:09.570 --> 40:12.740
Mrs. Lawson, or Mrs. Hartford.

40:13.740 --> 40:15.530
Maybe it was Maple.

40:15.620 --> 40:17.950
It's funny how sometimes
the people we remember the least

40:18.040 --> 40:20.620
make the greatest impression on us.

40:21.160 --> 40:23.540
I do remember she wore diamonds.

40:23.620 --> 40:27.420
And she always dressed in fine
clothing, as if she was going out.

40:27.500 --> 40:31.130
Although she never did
and nobody ever came to visit her.

40:32.840 --> 40:35.180
She taught me to play the piano.

40:40.520 --> 40:43.180
It's not about how well you play.

40:43.890 --> 40:46.770
It's how you feel
about what you're playing.

40:46.860 --> 40:48.190
Try this.

41:04.540 --> 41:07.790
You can't help putting yourself
in the music.

41:15.840 --> 41:17.840
There were many changes.

41:17.930 --> 41:21.060
Some you could see,
some you couldn't.

41:22.140 --> 41:25.020
Hair had started growing
in all sorts of places,

41:25.520 --> 41:27.520
along with other things.

41:28.770 --> 41:31.570
I felt pretty good, considering.

41:32.570 --> 41:35.280
Darling, the pain.

41:35.360 --> 41:37.910
All right, Mom, I'll get the nurse.

41:40.410 --> 41:43.200
Look at this eye.
This is a major hurricane,

41:43.290 --> 41:46.210
a slow hurricane,
with maximum sustained winds of...

41:46.290 --> 41:48.170
Not doing too good?

41:49.000 --> 41:52.300
Nobody seems to know
whether to stay or leave.

41:52.380 --> 41:54.670
I'm gonna ride it out.

41:54.760 --> 41:57.680
There.
That should make things much easier.

42:01.100 --> 42:04.310
Have you had a chance
to say your goodbyes?

42:04.390 --> 42:07.890
My father waited four hours for
my brother to get here from Boger City.

42:07.980 --> 42:09.980
Couldn't go without him.

42:10.480 --> 42:13.190
- She seems like a sweet woman.
- Yeah.

42:13.820 --> 42:15.530
I haven't had as much time with her
as I would've...

42:15.610 --> 42:17.530
- You busy? I could use your help.
- Excuse me.

42:17.610 --> 42:18.910
Sure.

42:37.050 --> 42:39.090
"Queenie would let me go
with Mr. Daws..."

42:39.180 --> 42:43.010
...to Poverty Point to watch the boats
go up and down the river.

42:43.100 --> 42:45.060
These were hard times.

42:48.060 --> 42:51.810
Did I ever tell you I was struck
by lightning seven times?

42:52.690 --> 42:56.150
Once when I was in the field,
just tending to my cows.

43:02.660 --> 43:04.950
My fourth hand didn't show up.

43:07.160 --> 43:10.670
Anybody want to make $2
for a day's work 'round here?

43:12.540 --> 43:14.250
What's the matter?

43:14.340 --> 43:17.130
Nobody wants to do an honest
day's work for an honest day's pay?

43:17.210 --> 43:18.800
He never pays.

43:20.220 --> 43:22.550
- Nobody wants a job?
- I do.

43:24.180 --> 43:27.020
You got your sea legs about you,
old man?

43:28.100 --> 43:29.520
I think.

43:33.440 --> 43:35.900
Well, that's good enough for me.

43:35.980 --> 43:39.490
Get your ass on board.
We'll sure as hell find out.

43:44.950 --> 43:46.620
I was as happy as I could be.

43:46.700 --> 43:47.950
I need a volunteer!

43:48.040 --> 43:49.410
I would do anything.

43:49.500 --> 43:50.960
Yes, Captain!

43:51.040 --> 43:53.370
Scrape off all this bird shit!

43:54.040 --> 43:55.790
Right away, sir.

43:56.590 --> 44:01.090
And I was actually gonna be paid
for something I would've done for free.

44:02.720 --> 44:05.090
His name was Captain Mike Clark.

44:06.060 --> 44:09.020
He'd been on a tugboat
since he was seven.

44:10.020 --> 44:11.770
Get moving, then.

44:12.690 --> 44:14.230
Come here.

44:16.230 --> 44:19.400
Can you still get it up?

44:20.740 --> 44:22.740
I do every morning.

44:23.410 --> 44:26.820
The old pole, huh? The high, hard one?

44:27.410 --> 44:28.740
I guess.

44:31.330 --> 44:34.000
When was the last time
you had a woman?

44:36.500 --> 44:38.420
- Never.
- Never?

44:38.920 --> 44:41.010
Not that I know of, sir.

44:41.470 --> 44:43.260
Wait a minute, now.

44:44.050 --> 44:48.180
You mean to say you've been
on this earth however many years

44:48.260 --> 44:51.600
and you've never had a woman?

44:56.230 --> 44:59.320
Damn, that's the saddest thing
I've ever heard in my life.

45:00.780 --> 45:02.030
Never?

45:02.780 --> 45:03.900
No.

45:06.490 --> 45:10.620
Well, then, by Jesus,
you are coming with me.

45:21.630 --> 45:23.210
What did your father do?

45:23.300 --> 45:25.380
I never met my father.

45:25.470 --> 45:27.430
You lucky bastard.

45:28.300 --> 45:30.970
All fathers want to do is hold you down.

45:33.560 --> 45:36.980
Out on my father's boat,
workin' the two-a-day,

45:37.310 --> 45:39.730
this little, fat bastard.

45:39.820 --> 45:41.570
"Tug Irish," they called him.

45:41.650 --> 45:45.030
Anyway, I finally work up the nerve
and tell him,

45:45.900 --> 45:49.620
"I don't want to spend the rest of my life
on a goddamn tugboat."

45:49.700 --> 45:51.700
You know what I'm saying?

45:52.080 --> 45:54.750
You don't want to spend
the rest of your life on a tugboat.

45:54.830 --> 45:57.170
Absolutely! Damn right!

45:59.920 --> 46:02.550
So you know
what my father says to me?

46:03.340 --> 46:07.800
He says,
"Who the hell do you think you are?

46:07.890 --> 46:10.680
"What the hell do you think you can do?"

46:10.930 --> 46:12.640
So I tell him.

46:13.220 --> 46:16.480
"Well, if you're asking,

46:18.690 --> 46:20.770
"I want to be an artist."

46:21.320 --> 46:23.230
He laughs.

46:23.690 --> 46:28.740
"An artist? God meant for you
to work a tugboat, just like me.

46:28.820 --> 46:31.450
"And that's exactly
what you're gonna do."

46:31.530 --> 46:34.830
Well, I turned myself into an artist.

46:37.250 --> 46:39.040
A tattoo artist!

46:41.420 --> 46:44.250
I put on every one of these myself.

46:46.760 --> 46:50.590
You have to skin me alive
to take my art away from me now.

46:51.390 --> 46:54.890
When I'm dead,
I'm gonna send him my arm.

46:56.140 --> 46:57.560
That one.

46:59.900 --> 47:02.520
Don't let anyone tell you different.

47:02.610 --> 47:05.230
You gotta do what you're meant to do.

47:05.320 --> 47:08.440
And I happen to be a goddamned artist.

47:09.030 --> 47:11.360
But you're a tugboat captain.

47:11.910 --> 47:13.660
Captain Mike?

47:13.740 --> 47:16.540
We're ready for you and your friend.

47:18.250 --> 47:21.290
Let's go, old timer, eh?
Break your cherry.

47:22.460 --> 47:25.210
- Hello, my lovelies!
- Hey, Captain.

47:25.300 --> 47:26.300
- Hi, Captain.
- Hi.

47:28.420 --> 47:29.550
- Hi.
- Hi.

47:29.630 --> 47:32.720
He gives me the willies.
That is not for me.

47:34.600 --> 47:36.930
How are you tonight, grandpa?

47:37.560 --> 47:39.730
It was a night to remember.

47:45.440 --> 47:49.110
What are you, Dick Tracy or something?
I've got to rest.

47:50.240 --> 47:51.490
Again.

47:52.780 --> 47:55.120
- Thank you.
- No, thank you. You have a nice night.

47:55.200 --> 47:57.370
- Will you be here tomorrow?
- Every night but Sunday.

47:57.450 --> 48:01.160
It sure made me understand
the value of earning a living.

48:01.790 --> 48:03.620
Good night, sweetie. Come back now.

48:03.710 --> 48:05.960
Things money can buy you.

48:23.600 --> 48:25.310
It's nasty out.

48:25.730 --> 48:28.650
Can I offer you a ride somewhere?

48:30.400 --> 48:32.700
Well, that's awfully kind of you, sir.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.500
My name is Thomas, Thomas Button.

48:45.170 --> 48:47.290
- I'm Benjamin.
- Benjamin.

48:48.500 --> 48:50.670
It's a pleasure to know you.

48:52.170 --> 48:55.430
Would you like to stop somewhere
and have a drink?

48:55.510 --> 48:56.930
All right.

48:58.180 --> 49:00.510
Evening, Mr. Button.

49:05.020 --> 49:07.020
What'll it be, sir?

49:07.690 --> 49:10.780
- I'll have whatever he's having.
- Sazerac for the both of us.

49:10.860 --> 49:13.240
With whiskey, not brandy.

49:13.320 --> 49:14.820
You don't drink, do you?

49:14.910 --> 49:17.530
- It's a night for firsts.
- How's that?

49:17.620 --> 49:19.700
I've never been to a brothel, either.

49:19.790 --> 49:22.580
Well, it's an experience.

49:22.700 --> 49:25.790
It certainly is.
There's a time for everything.

49:25.870 --> 49:28.330
- True enough.
- Your drinks.

49:29.960 --> 49:35.220
I don't mean to be rude, but your hands.
Is that painful?

49:35.510 --> 49:38.140
Well, I was born
with some form of disease.

49:38.220 --> 49:39.800
What kind of disease?

49:39.890 --> 49:41.680
I was born old.

49:43.180 --> 49:44.890
- I'm sorry.
- No need to be.

49:44.980 --> 49:47.560
There's nothing wrong with old age.

49:56.410 --> 49:59.450
My wife passed away many years ago.

50:00.830 --> 50:02.700
I'm so, so sorry.

50:04.120 --> 50:06.040
She died in childbirth.

50:09.500 --> 50:12.090
- To children.
- To mothers.

50:16.880 --> 50:19.180
What line of work you in, Mr. Button?

50:19.260 --> 50:23.430
Buttons. Button's Buttons.
There isn't a button that we don't make.

50:25.600 --> 50:27.980
Our biggest competition
is B. F. Goodrich

50:28.060 --> 50:29.810
and his infernal zippers.

50:29.900 --> 50:32.690
Would you gentlemen like
anything else?

50:32.770 --> 50:34.860
One for the road, Benjamin?

50:34.940 --> 50:37.780
Only if you let me pay for it, Mr. Button.

50:39.030 --> 50:41.530
So, what line of work do you do?

50:42.950 --> 50:45.410
I'm a tugboat man.

50:51.590 --> 50:53.630
I enjoyed talking to you.

50:54.090 --> 50:56.260
I enjoyed drinking with you.

50:59.800 --> 51:01.220
Benjamin?

51:01.300 --> 51:04.760
Would you mind if, time to time,
I stopped by and said hello?

51:04.850 --> 51:08.310
Anytime. Good night, Mr. Button.

51:08.810 --> 51:10.600
Good night, Benjamin.

51:11.310 --> 51:12.690
Drive on.

51:18.320 --> 51:19.700
Where have you been?

51:19.780 --> 51:24.830
Nothing. I met some people
and listened to some music.

51:27.540 --> 51:29.790
Oh, sweet Jesus, boy!

51:30.750 --> 51:33.880
Growing up's a funny thing.
Sneaks up on you.

51:34.800 --> 51:39.170
One person is there, then suddenly
somebody else has taken her place.

51:39.720 --> 51:41.430
She wasn't all elbows
and knees anymore.

51:41.510 --> 51:43.220
Benjamin! Come on!

51:43.550 --> 51:44.970
Okay.

51:46.180 --> 51:47.770
I loved those weekends
when she'd come

51:47.850 --> 51:50.680
and spend the night
with her grandmother.

51:58.740 --> 52:01.240
Daisy. Daisy.

52:02.410 --> 52:04.570
You want to see something?

52:05.700 --> 52:10.540
You gotta keep it a secret,
so get dressed. I'll meet you out back.

52:16.040 --> 52:17.420
Come on.

52:19.210 --> 52:22.340
- Can you swim?
- I can do anything you can do.

52:22.430 --> 52:25.050
Here, put this on. We gotta hurry.

52:37.980 --> 52:39.530
Is he okay?

52:39.610 --> 52:41.070
Captain?

52:42.700 --> 52:44.240
Captain Mike?

52:47.910 --> 52:50.660
Morning, Captain. Can you take us out?

52:51.790 --> 52:54.120
Do you know what day it is?

52:54.210 --> 52:55.500
Sunday?

52:55.580 --> 52:57.750
Do you know what that means?

52:59.050 --> 53:01.460
Means I was very drunk last night.

53:02.050 --> 53:04.340
Well, you're drunk every night.

53:06.760 --> 53:09.100
- Is that a girl?
- Close friend.

53:09.760 --> 53:10.890
I want to show her the river.

53:10.970 --> 53:14.310
You're not supposed to go joyriding
with civilians.

53:15.440 --> 53:17.610
I could lose my license.

53:27.410 --> 53:28.910
What are you waiting for?

53:59.060 --> 54:02.190
Pulled in for repair a wounded duck.

54:03.610 --> 54:05.780
She's flying now, huh?

54:06.280 --> 54:07.950
Ahoy, sailor!

54:12.490 --> 54:14.830
I wish we could go with them.

54:20.840 --> 54:23.130
Did you say something, Mom?

54:30.850 --> 54:32.850
It's getting really bad.

54:34.850 --> 54:36.680
Can you hear me, Mom?

54:39.270 --> 54:41.980
Time just seeped out of me.

54:48.700 --> 54:50.530
"Things were changing quickly."

54:50.620 --> 54:54.740
I don't know how it's possible,
but you seem to have more hair.

54:56.250 --> 54:59.250
What if I told you
that I wasn't getting older,

54:59.330 --> 55:02.630
but I was getting younger
than everybody else?

55:02.710 --> 55:06.630
Well, I'd feel sorry for you,

55:06.720 --> 55:09.590
to have to see everybody you love
die before you do.

55:09.680 --> 55:11.590
It's an awful responsibility.

55:11.680 --> 55:15.260
I'd never thought about life or death
that way before.

55:16.890 --> 55:20.980
Benjamin, we're meant
to lose the people we love.

55:21.400 --> 55:24.820
How else would we know
how important they are to us?

55:27.900 --> 55:32.410
And one fall day, a familiar visitor
came knocking on our door.

55:34.080 --> 55:36.910
You want to go with me
to the drugstore?

55:47.050 --> 55:49.420
She taught me how to play the piano.

55:49.510 --> 55:50.800
- Amen.
- Amen.

55:50.880 --> 55:54.090
And she taught me
what it meant to miss somebody.

55:58.600 --> 56:00.100
Let's go.

56:01.100 --> 56:03.020
I had gone to a brothel.

56:03.100 --> 56:05.440
I'd had my first drink.

56:05.520 --> 56:09.030
Said goodbye to one friend
and buried another.

56:09.530 --> 56:14.410
In 1936, when I was coming to the end
of the 17th year of my life,

56:14.490 --> 56:17.370
I packed my bag, said goodbye.

56:17.450 --> 56:19.790
- Bye, Benjamin.
- Goodbye.

56:19.870 --> 56:24.380
I knew, life being what it was,
I'd probably never see them again.

56:26.540 --> 56:28.210
Bye, Mr. Benjamin.

56:28.300 --> 56:30.800
- Good luck to you, son.
- Thank you.

56:35.300 --> 56:38.220
- I love you, Mama.
- I love you, too, baby.

56:39.390 --> 56:42.640
I want you to say your prayers
every night, hear?

56:47.480 --> 56:49.570
Be safe, hear?

57:00.950 --> 57:02.330
Benjamin!

57:05.420 --> 57:08.090
- Where you going?
- To sea.

57:09.460 --> 57:11.550
I'll send you a postcard.

57:13.340 --> 57:15.300
From everywhere.

57:15.390 --> 57:18.010
Write me a postcard from everywhere.

57:32.530 --> 57:34.400
Can you imagine?

57:36.780 --> 57:42.910
He sent me a postcard
from everywhere he went.

57:44.460 --> 57:46.460
Every place he worked.

57:47.750 --> 57:50.880
Newfoundland. Baffin Bay.

57:51.420 --> 57:54.550
Glasgow. Liverpool. Narvik.

57:55.300 --> 58:00.050
He had gone with that Captain Mike.

58:02.060 --> 58:04.310
Captain Mike had contracted
for three years

58:04.390 --> 58:06.730
with Moran Brothers Tug and Salvage.

58:06.810 --> 58:10.690
The old ship had been refitted with
a diesel engine and a new sea winch.

58:10.770 --> 58:13.690
We went around Florida
and up the Atlantic seaboard.

58:13.780 --> 58:17.200
We were a crew of seven now.
Captain Mike and me.

58:17.280 --> 58:20.660
Cookie, Prentiss Mayes
from Wilmington, Delaware.

58:20.740 --> 58:23.160
The Brody twins, Rick and Vic,

58:23.240 --> 58:25.500
who got along fine at sea
but, for some reason,

58:25.580 --> 58:28.670
once they were on dry land
couldn't stand the sight of each other.

58:28.750 --> 58:32.340
You know, one in every
eight boats never returns.

58:32.420 --> 58:34.550
There was John Grimm,
who sure fit his name.

58:34.630 --> 58:36.510
All hands lost at sea.

58:36.590 --> 58:38.840
From Belvedere, South Dakota.

58:40.220 --> 58:43.060
And Pleasant Curtis
from Asheville, Notch.

58:43.140 --> 58:46.350
Never said a word to anyone,
except himself.

58:48.440 --> 58:51.360
I wrote him constantly.

58:52.940 --> 58:57.990
I told him I had been invited to
audition in New York City

58:58.530 --> 59:01.200
for the School of American Ballet.

59:01.280 --> 59:02.700
Please stay.

59:02.780 --> 59:04.950
Thank you. Thank you.

59:06.910 --> 59:08.210
You can stay.

59:10.670 --> 59:13.790
But I was relegated to the corps.

59:14.090 --> 59:16.460
Another dancing gypsy.

59:20.760 --> 59:22.300
Benjamin!

59:22.930 --> 59:25.390
How is it when you showed up

59:25.470 --> 59:29.390
you were no bigger than a bollard
with one foot in the grave,

59:29.480 --> 59:33.690
but now, either I drink a hell
of a lot more than I think I do,

59:34.940 --> 59:36.610
or you sprouted?

59:37.490 --> 59:39.280
What's your secret?

59:40.660 --> 59:42.280
Well, Captain,

59:44.030 --> 59:45.870
you do drink a lot.

59:50.670 --> 59:54.920
We stayed in a small hotel
with a grand name, The Winter Palace.

59:55.000 --> 59:57.800
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

59:57.880 --> 01:00:01.380
The hummingbird
is not just another bird.

01:00:02.090 --> 01:00:05.850
Its heart rate's 1,200 beats per minute.

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:10.310
Its wings beat 80 times a second.

01:00:12.190 --> 01:00:15.230
If you was to stop their wings
from beating,

01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:18.690
it would be dead
in less than 10 seconds.

01:00:19.690 --> 01:00:22.360
This is no ordinary bird.

01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:25.160
This is a frickin' miracle.

01:00:28.290 --> 01:00:32.210
They slowed down their wings
with moving pictures,

01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:35.080
and you know what they saw?

01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:38.380
Their wingtips are doing that.

01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:46.260
You know what the figure eight
is the mathematical symbol for?

01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:50.810
Infinity.

01:00:50.890 --> 01:00:52.230
Infinity!

01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:58.650
Everybody, no matter
what differences they had,

01:00:58.730 --> 01:01:02.780
the languages, the color of their skin,
had one thing in common.

01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:06.070
They were drunk every single night.

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:07.700
Three, please.

01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:09.410
Could you hold, dear, for us, please?

01:01:09.490 --> 01:01:11.790
Thank you very much. Good evening.

01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:14.580
Her name was Elizabeth Abbott.

01:01:14.670 --> 01:01:18.000
She was not beautiful.
She was plain as paper.

01:01:18.090 --> 01:01:20.920
But she was pretty as any picture to me.

01:01:22.170 --> 01:01:24.260
What are you looking at?

01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:29.010
If you must know,
we have a longstanding agreement

01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:30.470
never to go to bed sober.

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:32.970
- Isn't that right, darling?
- Whatever you say, darling.

01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:35.140
Her husband was Walter Abbott.

01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:39.150
He was Chief Minister of
the British Trade Mission in Murmansk,

01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:40.860
and he was a spy.

01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:43.860
- Darling.
- Oh, thank you, my darling.

01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:45.990
- Key, darling.
- Oh, yes.

01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:53.540
I broke my heel off one of my shoes.

01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:57.250
I'm not in the habit of walking about
in my stocking feet.

01:02:01.630 --> 01:02:03.800
They were long days there.

01:02:11.310 --> 01:02:13.310
And even longer nights.

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:19.060
One particular night,
I was having trouble sleeping.

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:22.020
I'm sorry.

01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:25.650
I couldn't sleep.

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:42.000
I was gonna make some tea.
Would you like some?

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:44.760
Oh, no. Thank you.

01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:24.170
Milk? Honey?

01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:26.710
A bit of honey, please.

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:29.010
I hope you like flies in your honey.

01:03:29.090 --> 01:03:30.800
Oh, perhaps not.

01:03:45.610 --> 01:03:49.900
Oh, maybe better to let it steep a little.

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:52.070
Steep?

01:03:52.410 --> 01:03:53.530
Soak.

01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:57.450
I don't know, I mean,
there's a proper way of making tea.

01:03:57.540 --> 01:04:00.790
Well, where I'm from,
people just want it to be hot.

01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:03.000
Well, quite right.

01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:14.300
- Now, you're a seaman.
- A sailor.

01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:17.140
I hope you won't think me impolite,
but I have to ask,

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:19.350
aren't you a little old
to be working on a boat?

01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:22.890
There's no age limit,
as long as you can do the work.

01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:35.990
And you have trouble sleeping?
Thank you.

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:39.290
I didn't think I did.
I usually sleep like a baby.

01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:42.710
Something's been keeping me up.

01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:45.130
My father, in his 80s,

01:04:45.210 --> 01:04:48.500
he was so convinced
he was gonna die in his sleep,

01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:52.300
he limited himself
to having afternoon naps.

01:04:53.010 --> 01:04:55.800
He was so determined
he was gonna cheat death.

01:04:56.970 --> 01:04:58.850
- Did he?
- Did he what?

01:04:58.970 --> 01:05:00.640
Die in his sleep?

01:05:02.310 --> 01:05:04.900
He died sitting in his favorite chair

01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:07.650
listening to his favorite program
on the wireless.

01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:10.230
He must have known something.

01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:21.040
My husband's the British Trade Minister,
and we've been here for 14 months.

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:24.460
- Good God.
- We were supposed to go to Peking

01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:28.040
but it never seemed to work out.

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:31.210
Have you been in the Far East?

01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:33.510
No. I've never been anywhere, really.

01:05:33.590 --> 01:05:36.050
I mean, outside of harbors.

01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:37.800
And where is it that you're from?

01:05:37.890 --> 01:05:40.430
New Orleans. Louisiana.

01:05:41.890 --> 01:05:44.230
I didn't know there was another.

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:51.570
And she told me about all the places
she had been, and what she had seen.

01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:56.070
And we talked till just before the dawn.

01:05:57.070 --> 01:05:58.570
I'm just a lush, myself.

01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:03.620
And we went back to our rooms,
to our separate lives.

01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:12.380
But every night,
we'd meet again in that lobby.

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:21.600
A hotel in the middle of the night
can be a magical place.

01:06:24.430 --> 01:06:27.390
A mouse running, and stopping.

01:06:28.770 --> 01:06:30.900
A radiator hissing.

01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:33.780
A curtain blowing.

01:06:37.530 --> 01:06:40.910
There's something peaceful,
even comforting

01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:44.240
knowing that the people you love
are asleep in their beds

01:06:44.330 --> 01:06:46.580
where nothing can harm them.

01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:52.630
Elizabeth and I would lose track
of the night

01:06:53.130 --> 01:06:55.340
until just before daybreak.

01:06:57.930 --> 01:07:00.720
I think I may have given you
the wrong impression.

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:02.350
Beg pardon?

01:07:02.430 --> 01:07:06.270
Well, married women don't customarily
sit around

01:07:06.350 --> 01:07:08.390
in the middle of the night
with strange men in hotels.

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:12.060
I wouldn't know what a married woman
does or doesn't do.

01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:19.280
Good night.

01:07:21.570 --> 01:07:22.910
Murmansk.

01:07:25.490 --> 01:07:28.580
"I've met somebody,
and I've fallen in love."

01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:29.910
Mom?

01:07:33.710 --> 01:07:36.300
That was over 60 years ago.

01:07:37.550 --> 01:07:38.590
Did you love him, Mother?

01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:41.470
What does a girl know about love?

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:16.290
Well...

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:22.550
- I'm not dressed.
- Oh, you look splendid, just as you are.

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:27.890
Don't waste any time bothering about
the wine or the cheese in Murmansk,

01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:31.020
'cause they're really
completely ordinary,

01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:36.109
but the caviar and the vodka

01:08:36.649 --> 01:08:40.779
are sublime and plentiful.

01:08:44.529 --> 01:08:45.870
So.

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:52.460
Savor it.

01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:56.540
And don't eat it all at once,

01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:59.750
because that way,
there's nothing left to enjoy.

01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:05.760
And now, take a little swallow of vodka
while it's still in your mouth.

01:09:20.609 --> 01:09:23.490
You haven't been with many women,
have you?

01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:26.319
Not on Sundays.

01:09:28.490 --> 01:09:30.240
And you've never had caviar before,
have you?

01:09:30.330 --> 01:09:32.000
No, ma'am.

01:09:37.790 --> 01:09:39.500
When I was 19,

01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:46.760
I attempted to become the first woman
ever to swim the English Channel.

01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:49.180
Really?

01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:52.850
But the current that day
was so strong that,

01:09:52.930 --> 01:09:56.060
for every stroke I took,
I was pushed back two.

01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:59.270
I was in the water for 32 hours.

01:10:00.190 --> 01:10:04.070
And when I was two miles from Calais,

01:10:05.150 --> 01:10:06.950
it started to rain.

01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:09.570
That's it! Steady on!

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:12.740
When I couldn't go any further,

01:10:14.290 --> 01:10:15.790
I stopped.

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:18.790
I just stopped.

01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:24.260
And everybody asked me,
would I try again?

01:10:24.970 --> 01:10:26.840
For why wouldn't I?

01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:31.470
But I never did.

01:10:32.850 --> 01:10:37.140
As a matter of fact, I've never done
anything with my life after that.

01:10:41.230 --> 01:10:43.320
Your hands are so coarse.

01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:56.200
I can feel the wind in your cheek.

01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:05.510
I'm afraid it's the witching hour.

01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:14.640
It was the first time
a woman had ever kissed me.

01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:17.600
It's something you never forget.

01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:30.110
I think you make me feel younger.

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:32.780
You make me feel years younger, too.

01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:34.490
I wish I was.

01:11:35.450 --> 01:11:37.620
So many things I'd change.

01:11:38.290 --> 01:11:40.620
I'd undo all my mistakes.

01:11:40.710 --> 01:11:42.460
What mistakes?

01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:47.960
I kept waiting, you know?

01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:53.090
Thinking that I'd do something
to change my circumstances.

01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:56.100
Do something.

01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:00.890
Such an awful waste.
You never get it back.

01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:02.850
Wasted time.

01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:11.570
If we're going to have an affair,

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:15.120
you're never to look at me
during the day.

01:12:15.740 --> 01:12:18.700
And we're always to part before sunrise.

01:12:19.330 --> 01:12:22.000
And we will never say "I love you."

01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:25.420
Those are the rules.

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:30.170
- Are you cold?
- I'm freezing.

01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:32.220
Oh, you! You're frozen.

01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:35.550
What an idiot, I'm standing here
in this fur. How thoughtless of me.

01:13:09.170 --> 01:13:12.010
She was the first woman
that ever loved me.

01:13:14.970 --> 01:13:16.220
You want me to skip some?

01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:22.100
No, I'm glad he had somebody
to keep him warm.

01:13:25.730 --> 01:13:28.230
"I couldn't wait to see her again."

01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:43.450
We saw each other every night.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.330
We always used the same room.

01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:51.670
But each time seemed new
and different.

01:13:53.010 --> 01:13:54.510
Come here.

01:14:01.930 --> 01:14:03.350
Elizabeth.

01:14:04.690 --> 01:14:06.140
Good night.

01:14:08.810 --> 01:14:10.480
Until one night.

01:14:47.730 --> 01:14:53.320
Yesterday, December 7th, 1941,

01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:56.530
a date which will live in infamy...

01:14:56.610 --> 01:15:00.780
It's a meeting, a policy meeting
regarding your future,

01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:03.280
possibly beyond.

01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:07.250
There's been a change of plan, lads.

01:15:07.410 --> 01:15:10.040
As you may or may not know,

01:15:10.130 --> 01:15:12.750
the Japs bombed
Pearl Harbor yesterday.

01:15:13.170 --> 01:15:16.670
Frank D. Roosevelt's asked
each of us to do our part.

01:15:17.130 --> 01:15:21.260
The Chelsea's been commissioned
to serve in the United States Navy.

01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:24.970
To repair, to salvage, and to rescue.

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:30.850
Anybody doesn't want to go to war,
now is the time to say so.

01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:35.150
Once you set foot on that boat,
you're in the Navy, friend.

01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:41.410
Yeah, I've been meaning
to talk with you, Mike.

01:15:41.490 --> 01:15:43.530
My wife's doing poorly.

01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:46.370
I'd like to maybe see her one more time.

01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:51.920
You're free to make your way home
any way you can, Mr. Mayes.

01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:59.300
Well, if he's leaving, who's gonna cook?

01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:03.470
Food poisoning's one of the leading
causes of death at sea.

01:16:03.550 --> 01:16:05.930
Right after
inadequate safety equipment.

01:16:06.010 --> 01:16:08.680
I can cook, Captain.
Been doing it all my life.

01:16:08.770 --> 01:16:13.190
I don't know.
You're a little moody for war, Benjamin.

01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:15.230
What the hell?

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:19.690
I'll take any man wants to kick the shite
out of the Japs and the Huns.

01:16:21.070 --> 01:16:24.870
That's it, pack your gear.
We're going to war, gentlemen!

01:16:31.710 --> 01:16:33.500
She had left a note.

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:37.630
She wrote,
"It was nice to have met you."

01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:40.010
And that was it.

01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:46.260
It wasn't the war any of us expected.

01:16:46.350 --> 01:16:50.020
We would just tow crippled ships,
scraps of metal, really.

01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:53.600
If there was a war, we didn't see it.

01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:59.570
There was a man assigned to us.
The Chief Gunner loved the Navy.

01:16:59.650 --> 01:17:01.860
But most of all, he loved America.

01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:04.860
There is no other country in the world.

01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:06.070
When you spell America...

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:10.330
His name was Dennis Smith,
and he was a full-blooded Cherokee.

01:17:10.410 --> 01:17:13.540
His family had been Americans
for over 500 years.

01:17:13.620 --> 01:17:18.170
These pacifists.
They say they won't fight on conscience.

01:17:18.250 --> 01:17:21.880
Now, where would be
if everybody decided to act

01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:25.970
- according to their conscience?
- Keep it down, would you, Chief?

01:17:42.150 --> 01:17:45.700
Hey. I've been watching you.

01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:48.530
You seem trustworthy.

01:17:50.290 --> 01:17:52.410
If something happens to me,

01:17:56.460 --> 01:17:59.040
could you see that this gets to my wife?

01:17:59.130 --> 01:18:03.710
He'd given me all of his pay.
Hadn't spent a dime of it.

01:18:05.590 --> 01:18:08.890
I want my family to know
I was thinking about them.

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:15.480
All hands on deck!

01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:20.770
Get your asses up here,
you lazy bastards!

01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:44.300
The war had finally found us.

01:18:46.970 --> 01:18:48.470
All stop!

01:18:51.140 --> 01:18:53.180
Pleasant, man that light.

01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:05.230
A transport carrying 1,300 men
had been split by a torpedo.

01:19:07.610 --> 01:19:09.910
We were first to arrive at the scene.

01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:13.580
- Cut the engines!
- All stop!

01:19:18.670 --> 01:19:20.620
We were the only sound.

01:19:34.510 --> 01:19:35.970
Fellas!

01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:47.030
Sub!

01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:54.620
We sure as hell
can't outrun them fuckers.

01:19:56.330 --> 01:19:58.660
Battle stations!

01:20:08.510 --> 01:20:09.550
Thank you, Chief.

01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:12.930
What?

01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:27.730
Is that the last one?

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:50.570
Captain!

01:22:06.170 --> 01:22:08.830
They shot the hell out of my painting!

01:22:10.090 --> 01:22:11.960
Give me your other hand.

01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:18.340
You'll be all right, Captain.

01:22:18.430 --> 01:22:22.720
They got a nice spot in Heaven
waiting for you. Nice spot.

01:22:24.230 --> 01:22:27.310
You can be as mad as a mad dog
at the way things went.

01:22:30.270 --> 01:22:33.980
You could swear, curse the Fates.

01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:38.410
But when it comes to the end,

01:22:40.580 --> 01:22:42.370
you have to let go.

01:22:49.330 --> 01:22:50.580
Captain?

01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:14.730
Thirteen hundred and twenty eight men
died that day.

01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:20.280
I said my goodbyes to the Cherokee,
Dennis Smith.

01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:24.450
John Grimm, who was right,
he was gonna die there.

01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:28.660
I sent Pleasant Curtis' wife his money.

01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:32.540
I said goodbye to the twin, Vic Brody,

01:23:32.630 --> 01:23:37.340
and to Mike Clark,
captain of the tugboat Chelsea.

01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:44.260
I said goodbye to all the other men
who had dreams of their own,

01:23:44.350 --> 01:23:46.930
all the men
who wanted to be insurance salesmen

01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:49.980
or doctors or lawyers or Indian chiefs.

01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:52.860
This don't get fixed.

01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:58.030
Out here, death didn't seem natural.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:18.210
I'd never seen a hummingbird
that far out to sea.

01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:21.340
Before or since.

01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:33.440
And in May of 1945,
when I was 26 years old,

01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:34.650
I came home.

01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:38.190
I'm ready! I'm ready!

01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:39.650
I'm coming!

01:24:40.530 --> 01:24:44.200
- I'm ready!
- All right, I'm coming, Miss Alfalina.

01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:45.820
- Queenie?
- Yes?

01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:57.590
Sweet Jesus! Oh, you're home!
Oh, Lord, you came back!

01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:00.420
- Let me look at you.
- Who's that, Mama?

01:25:00.510 --> 01:25:03.760
- Child, it's your brother, Benjamin.
- I didn't know he was my brother.

01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:05.550
There's a shitload of things
you don't know, child.

01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:06.800
Get on out there and finish sweeping.

01:25:06.890 --> 01:25:09.100
Come here, wash your hands,
help me with the table. Go on, now.

01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:13.100
Turn around.
You look like you've been born again.

01:25:13.190 --> 01:25:15.440
Younger than the springtime.

01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:19.190
I think that preacher laid hands on you
gave you a second life.

01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:22.950
I knew it that moment I saw you,
you were special.

01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:24.910
I tell you what, my knees are sore,

01:25:24.990 --> 01:25:27.530
'cause I've been on them every night
asking the Lord,

01:25:27.620 --> 01:25:31.370
I said,
"God, just bring him home safely."

01:25:31.450 --> 01:25:33.960
Remember what I told you?

01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:35.710
"You never know
what's coming for you?"

01:25:35.790 --> 01:25:37.710
That's right. Sit down.

01:25:39.090 --> 01:25:43.220
Well, you learn anything
worth repeating?

01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:49.560
- I sure saw some things.
- Oh, you seen some pain.

01:25:51.060 --> 01:25:53.810
- Some joy, too?
- Sure. Sure, I did.

01:25:53.890 --> 01:25:58.060
Yeah, that's what I want to hear.
Look at you.

01:25:58.150 --> 01:26:01.690
- Where's Tizzy?
- Oh, baby.

01:26:04.110 --> 01:26:07.990
Mr. Weathers died in his sleep
one night last April.

01:26:08.070 --> 01:26:11.580
- Mama, I'm so sorry.
- Don't you worry about that, baby.

01:26:13.290 --> 01:26:15.960
Yeah, well, it's only
one or two of them left now.

01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:17.500
They all just about new.

01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:21.500
Guess they're waiting their turn
like everybody else, huh?

01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:24.340
I'm so glad you're back home with me!

01:26:24.420 --> 01:26:27.590
Now, we're gonna have to find you
a wife and a new job! That's right.

01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:29.600
Come on in here,
help me with this table.

01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:34.350
Benjamin.

01:26:34.430 --> 01:26:37.560
You're wasting your time, baby.
She's stone deaf.

01:26:37.650 --> 01:26:41.690
Oh, and you'll be staying in
what was Mrs. DeSeroux's old room.

01:26:41.770 --> 01:26:44.740
You're too big to be rooming
with anybody else.

01:26:48.820 --> 01:26:51.450
It's a funny thing about coming home.

01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:55.910
Looks the same,
smells the same, feels the same.

01:26:58.630 --> 01:27:02.460
Did I ever tell you I've been struck
by lightning seven times?

01:27:04.130 --> 01:27:07.510
Once when I was sitting in my truck,
just minding my own business.

01:27:13.350 --> 01:27:16.810
You realize what's changed is you.

01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:23.520
And late one morning,
not long after I'd been back...

01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:25.280
Thank you.

01:27:47.340 --> 01:27:48.420
Hey.

01:27:52.970 --> 01:27:56.850
- Excuse me, is Queenie here?
- Daisy?

01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:04.230
- It's me, Benjamin.
- Benjamin?

01:28:07.940 --> 01:28:09.950
Oh, my God!

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:15.160
Of course it's you! Benjamin!

01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:20.120
How are you?
It's been such a long time.

01:28:20.210 --> 01:28:22.960
There's so much I want to know.
When did you get back?

01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:24.460
Well, I got back a few weeks ago.

01:28:24.540 --> 01:28:28.550
I spoke to Queenie, she said you were
in the war, somewhere at sea.

01:28:28.630 --> 01:28:32.380
- We were so, so worried about you.
- Oh, I'm okay.

01:28:32.470 --> 01:28:36.390
Well, look at you. You're so lovely.

01:28:38.140 --> 01:28:39.930
You stopped writing.

01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:47.150
"When I had left, she was a girl.
And a woman had taken her place.

01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:50.650
"She was the most beautiful woman
I'd ever seen."

01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:52.070
Beautiful.

01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:56.070
"The most beautiful."

01:28:57.870 --> 01:28:59.620
- You remember Grandma Fuller?
- Why, sure I do.

01:28:59.700 --> 01:29:02.790
- She passed.
- I heard that. I'm sorry.

01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:07.500
I just can't believe we're both here.
Must be fate.

01:29:07.590 --> 01:29:09.550
No, no, what do they call it?

01:29:09.630 --> 01:29:11.050
Kismet.

01:29:11.130 --> 01:29:13.050
Do you know about Edgar Cayce,
the psychic?

01:29:13.130 --> 01:29:14.180
I don't believe I...

01:29:14.260 --> 01:29:17.140
He says
that everything is predetermined,

01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:20.600
but I like to think of it as fate.

01:29:23.770 --> 01:29:27.020
I'm not sure how it works,
but I'm glad it happened.

01:29:27.110 --> 01:29:30.730
Have you been to Manhattan?
It's right across the river from me.

01:29:30.820 --> 01:29:32.990
Now, I can see
the Empire State Building

01:29:33.070 --> 01:29:34.860
if I stand on my bed.

01:29:34.950 --> 01:29:36.950
What about you?
Where have you been?

01:29:37.030 --> 01:29:40.660
Tell me everything. Last time you wrote,
you said you'd been to Russia.

01:29:40.750 --> 01:29:44.920
I've always wanted to go to Russia.
Is it as cold as they say?

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.790
- Twice as cold.
- My goodness.

01:29:48.380 --> 01:29:53.090
We always said you were different.
But I think you really are.

01:29:55.130 --> 01:29:58.720
You wrote that you met somebody.
Did it work out?

01:29:59.180 --> 01:30:00.890
It ran its course.

01:30:02.230 --> 01:30:04.310
Hey, do you remember this?

01:30:15.150 --> 01:30:17.910
"This is the picture
of Old Man Kangaroo

01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:20.120
"at 5:00 in the afternoon."

01:30:21.910 --> 01:30:24.160
Would you like to have dinner?

01:30:31.630 --> 01:30:34.550
Did I tell you
that I danced for Balanchine?

01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:39.760
Oh, he's a famous choreographer.
He said that I had perfect line.

01:30:41.470 --> 01:30:46.020
You know, in a rehearsal once,
a dancer fell.

01:30:46.100 --> 01:30:48.940
And he just...
He just put it right into the production.

01:30:49.020 --> 01:30:52.520
I mean, can you imagine that?
Like in a... In a classical ballet?

01:30:52.610 --> 01:30:55.860
You know, a dancer,
intentionally falling.

01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:59.610
There's a whole new word
for dance now. It's called "abstract."

01:30:59.700 --> 01:31:01.030
No, he's not the only one, though.

01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:05.040
There's Lincoln Kirstein
and Lucia Chase, and oh, my...

01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:07.620
Oh, there's Agnes de Mille.

01:31:07.710 --> 01:31:09.790
She's just torn up all those conventions,

01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:11.880
you know,
all that straight-up-and-down stuff.

01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:15.170
It's not about the formality of the dance,
it's about what the dancer's feeling.

01:31:15.260 --> 01:31:17.970
As she told me
about this big new world,

01:31:18.050 --> 01:31:20.590
names that didn't mean a thing to me,

01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:22.760
I didn't really hear very much
of what she was saying.

01:31:22.850 --> 01:31:25.100
It's new and it's modern
and it's American.

01:31:25.180 --> 01:31:28.350
They understand our vigor
and our physicality.

01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:30.600
Oh, my God.
I've just been talking and talking.

01:31:30.690 --> 01:31:35.190
No, no, I've enjoyed listening.
I didn't know you smoked.

01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:36.860
I'm old enough.

01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:42.740
I'm old enough for a lot of things.

01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:48.080
In New York, we stay up all night,

01:31:49.330 --> 01:31:52.170
watch the sun come up
over the warehouses.

01:31:54.460 --> 01:31:56.800
There's always something to do.

01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:16.610
I have to go back tomorrow.

01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:19.900
- So soon.
- Wish I could stay.

01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:27.870
Dancers don't need costumes
or scenery anymore.

01:32:27.950 --> 01:32:31.500
I can imagine
dancing completely naked.

01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:35.170
Have you read D. H. Lawrence?

01:32:35.250 --> 01:32:37.380
- Well...
- His books were banned.

01:32:37.460 --> 01:32:41.010
The words are like making love.

01:33:25.510 --> 01:33:30.140
In our company,
we have to trust each other.

01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:39.110
Sex is a part of it.

01:33:43.490 --> 01:33:46.410
You know,
a lot of the dancers are lesbians.

01:33:48.530 --> 01:33:51.660
There was one woman
who wanted to sleep with me.

01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:01.960
- Does that upset you?
- Which part?

01:34:03.050 --> 01:34:05.510
Somebody wanting to sleep with me.

01:34:06.010 --> 01:34:07.180
You're a desirable woman.

01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:11.010
I would think most of them
would want to sleep with you.

01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:13.220
Let's go back to the house.

01:34:14.140 --> 01:34:16.560
Or we could get a room somewhere.

01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:22.730
- We could lay down your jacket.
- I don't know, Daisy.

01:34:22.820 --> 01:34:28.200
It's not that I wouldn't like to or anything.
I think I'll just disappoint you.

01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:32.200
Oh, Benjamin, I've been with older men.

01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:35.000
You're going back to New York
in the morning.

01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:37.420
You should be with your friends.

01:34:38.420 --> 01:34:40.920
- You're only young once.
- Oh, I'm old enough.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.630
Daisy, just not tonight, is all.

01:34:57.140 --> 01:34:59.310
We could go hear some music.

01:35:01.570 --> 01:35:04.280
Our lives are defined by opportunities.

01:35:05.110 --> 01:35:07.110
Even the ones we miss.

01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:11.620
You look so handsome
and so distinguished.

01:35:11.700 --> 01:35:13.870
They're saying the hurricane's
gonna miss us, blow right on by.

01:35:13.950 --> 01:35:18.580
- Oh, that's great.
- I'll stay under the blankets with Mother.

01:35:18.670 --> 01:35:22.790
She says nothing... Benjamin?

01:35:24.670 --> 01:35:25.760
"Things were becoming different..."

01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:27.050
...for me.

01:35:27.130 --> 01:35:30.720
My hair had very little gray
and grew like weeds.

01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:34.600
My sense of smell was keener.
My hearing, more acute.

01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:37.350
I could walk further and faster.

01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:43.230
While everybody else was aging,
I was getting younger, all alone.

01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:47.490
Come in.

01:35:48.860 --> 01:35:50.200
Benjamin.

01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:54.410
- Do you remember me?
- Well, sure I do, Mr. Button.

01:35:55.080 --> 01:35:58.660
- What happened to you?
- Darn foot. Got infected, so...

01:36:00.330 --> 01:36:01.580
Welcome home, my friend.

01:36:04.250 --> 01:36:07.380
I see you're still drinking
your Sazerac with whiskey.

01:36:07.470 --> 01:36:08.720
Creature of habit.

01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:10.930
You still visiting the house
on Bourbon Street?

01:36:11.010 --> 01:36:12.760
Not for a long time.

01:36:14.350 --> 01:36:16.430
Interesting times, though.

01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:20.980
We went from making 40,000
to nearly half a million buttons a day.

01:36:21.060 --> 01:36:23.100
We employed 10 times
the number of people.

01:36:23.190 --> 01:36:25.690
We were operating around the clock.

01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:31.650
Damn shame.

01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:35.700
The war has been kind
to the button industry.

01:36:38.410 --> 01:36:39.790
You know,

01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:45.380
I'm sick.
I don't know how much longer I have.

01:36:45.460 --> 01:36:48.340
- I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Button.
- No...

01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:52.800
I don't have any people.
I keep to myself.

01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:58.310
I hope you don't mind,
but, whenever possible,

01:36:58.390 --> 01:37:00.390
I'd enjoy your company.

01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:03.020
I'll certainly do what I can.

01:37:06.270 --> 01:37:09.230
Benjamin, do you know anything
about buttons?

01:37:12.780 --> 01:37:17.450
Now, Button's Buttons has been
in our family for 124 years.

01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:22.710
My grandfather was a tailor,
and he had a small shop in Richmond.

01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:25.210
After the Civil War,
he moved to New Orleans,

01:37:25.290 --> 01:37:30.340
where my father had the wisdom
to make our own buttons.

01:37:30.420 --> 01:37:35.340
So, with his help,
the tailor shop grew to this.

01:37:36.050 --> 01:37:38.680
And today, I can't sew a stitch.

01:37:42.850 --> 01:37:45.230
That's very, very interesting.

01:37:48.650 --> 01:37:51.280
You sure have done well for yourself.

01:37:52.190 --> 01:37:56.280
So, what can I do for you, Mr. Button?

01:37:58.780 --> 01:38:01.830
Benjamin? You're my son.

01:38:09.340 --> 01:38:12.010
I'm so sorry I never told you before.

01:38:14.130 --> 01:38:17.550
You were born
the night the Great War ended.

01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:23.140
Your mother died giving birth to you.

01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:26.850
I thought you were a monster.

01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:33.690
I promised your mother
I'd make sure you were safe.

01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:42.580
I should never have abandoned you.

01:38:46.670 --> 01:38:48.040
My mother?

01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:52.340
At the summer house
on Lake Pontchartrain.

01:38:52.420 --> 01:38:55.880
When I was a boy,
I'd love to wake up before anyone else,

01:38:55.970 --> 01:38:59.010
run down to that lake
and watch the day begin.

01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:03.310
It was as if I was the only one alive.

01:39:05.100 --> 01:39:07.850
I fell in love the first time I saw her.

01:39:08.350 --> 01:39:11.020
Your mother's name
was Caroline Murphy.

01:39:11.650 --> 01:39:14.530
She worked
in your grandfather's kitchen.

01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:19.490
She's from Dublin.

01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:24.540
In 1903, Caroline and all her brothers
and sisters came to live here,

01:39:24.620 --> 01:39:26.200
in New Orleans.

01:39:28.290 --> 01:39:31.170
I'd find excuses
to go down to that kitchen

01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:34.130
just so I could look at her.

01:39:40.470 --> 01:39:44.220
April 25th, 1918.
Happiest day of my life.

01:39:44.970 --> 01:39:47.230
The day I married your mother.

01:39:48.940 --> 01:39:51.100
Why didn't you just tell me?

01:39:51.940 --> 01:39:54.820
I plan on leaving everything I have
to you.

01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:58.780
- I have to go.
- Where?

01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:01.240
Home.

01:40:01.910 --> 01:40:03.240
And what does he think, anyway?

01:40:03.330 --> 01:40:04.660
He thinks he can just show up

01:40:04.740 --> 01:40:06.620
and everything's
supposed to be fine and dandy.

01:40:06.700 --> 01:40:09.330
Everybody's just supposed to be friends.

01:40:09.420 --> 01:40:12.330
Well, he got another thing coming,
that's for sure.

01:40:12.420 --> 01:40:15.840
God be my witness,
he got another thing coming.

01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:19.010
He left us $18 that night you was found.

01:40:19.090 --> 01:40:20.930
Eighteen ratty dollars

01:40:21.010 --> 01:40:22.760
- and a filthy diaper.
- Good night, Mama.

01:40:24.100 --> 01:40:25.300
Good night, baby.

01:40:38.570 --> 01:40:42.950
Did I ever tell you
I was struck by lightning seven times?

01:40:44.700 --> 01:40:46.780
Once, I was walking my dog
down the road.

01:40:51.750 --> 01:40:55.630
I'm blind in the one eye,
can't hardly hear,

01:40:56.840 --> 01:41:01.470
get twitches and shakes out of nowhere,
always losing my line of thought.

01:41:03.010 --> 01:41:04.720
But you know what?

01:41:05.470 --> 01:41:08.430
God keeps reminding me
I'm lucky to be alive.

01:41:14.150 --> 01:41:15.730
Storm's coming.

01:41:43.630 --> 01:41:45.890
May I help you, sir?
Up the stairs, first bedroom.

01:41:45.970 --> 01:41:47.050
Thank you.

01:42:02.900 --> 01:42:04.200
Wake up.

01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:08.570
Let's get you dressed.

01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:37.650
Now that's something.

01:42:40.900 --> 01:42:42.280
Thank you.

01:43:42.420 --> 01:43:46.380
You can be mad as a mad dog
at the way things went.

01:43:46.470 --> 01:43:48.930
You can swear and curse the Fates.

01:43:50.470 --> 01:43:52.720
But when it comes to the end,

01:43:53.930 --> 01:43:55.680
you have to let go.

01:44:17.660 --> 01:44:20.290
Well, it sure is a beautiful service.

01:44:22.130 --> 01:44:24.960
He'll be buried
right next to your mother.

01:44:26.380 --> 01:44:28.050
You're my mother.

01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:33.140
My baby.

01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:39.850
Now, I'd never seen New York.

01:46:08.020 --> 01:46:11.440
- Excuse me, I'm a friend of Daisy's.
- Right this way.

01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:17.820
- Daisy has company. Daisy! Daisy!
- Yes!

01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:21.490
- We need the wardrobe.
- Is somebody looking for me?

01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:26.290
- Benjamin.
- Hi.

01:46:27.580 --> 01:46:31.380
- What are you doing here?
- Thought I'd come visit.

01:46:31.460 --> 01:46:34.920
Spend some time with you, if I could.

01:46:35.010 --> 01:46:40.930
Oh, well, I wish you would've called.
You took me by surprise.

01:46:42.270 --> 01:46:46.440
- You can just throw them out.
- No. Thank you, they're lovely.

01:46:47.020 --> 01:46:51.860
I couldn't take my eyes off of you.
I thought you were mesmerizing.

01:46:53.860 --> 01:46:56.700
Thank you.
That's very kind of you to say.

01:47:01.990 --> 01:47:04.080
I better get changed.
A group of us are going to a party.

01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:07.420
- Would you want to come?
- Someone told me about a restaurant

01:47:07.500 --> 01:47:08.790
I thought you might enjoy.

01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:11.420
I made a reservation, just in case.

01:47:11.500 --> 01:47:14.510
Just, all the dancers go out
after the show. You're...

01:47:14.590 --> 01:47:18.430
You're welcome to come with us.
I'll get changed. All right?

01:47:24.850 --> 01:47:26.980
She choreographs
for the Ballets Russes.

01:47:27.060 --> 01:47:28.390
She's divine.

01:47:29.020 --> 01:47:30.860
You were breathtaking.

01:47:36.530 --> 01:47:37.820
Sweetie.

01:47:38.950 --> 01:47:41.870
This is David.
He dances with the company.

01:47:42.830 --> 01:47:44.870
- This is Benjamin.
- Who?

01:47:44.950 --> 01:47:48.210
- I told you about him.
- Oh, yeah. How you doing?

01:47:48.290 --> 01:47:51.790
- I'll go get you a drink.
- All right. Thanks.

01:47:59.470 --> 01:48:02.640
So, you were a friend
of her grandmother's?

01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:04.680
Or something like that?

01:48:05.810 --> 01:48:07.600
Something like that.

01:48:07.890 --> 01:48:09.480
Hey, excuse me.

01:48:31.790 --> 01:48:33.080
Come on.

01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:55.480
Hey!

01:48:56.440 --> 01:48:58.940
Now, I had no idea you were coming.

01:48:59.950 --> 01:49:01.530
Lord, Benjamin.

01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:07.990
What did you expect?
What, you want me to drop everything?

01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:10.040
Now, this is my life.

01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:12.620
Babe! You going downtown?

01:49:17.550 --> 01:49:20.670
Come on. You'll have a good time.

01:49:21.510 --> 01:49:23.050
There's lots of musicians,
interesting people.

01:49:23.130 --> 01:49:26.050
You don't have to do that.
This is my fault.

01:49:27.140 --> 01:49:28.560
I should've called.

01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:31.480
I thought I'd come here

01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:34.310
and sweep you off your feet
or something.

01:49:35.810 --> 01:49:40.320
- Daisy! Come on! Let's go.
- Be right there.

01:49:42.070 --> 01:49:43.490
Seems nice.

01:49:44.820 --> 01:49:46.450
Do you love him?

01:49:49.540 --> 01:49:50.950
I think so.

01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:54.750
I'm happy for you.

01:49:56.670 --> 01:49:58.790
Maybe I'll see you at home.

01:50:01.380 --> 01:50:02.510
Okay.

01:50:04.510 --> 01:50:06.300
I enjoyed the show!

01:50:13.890 --> 01:50:18.440
He came to tell me his father had died.

01:50:19.900 --> 01:50:26.110
- You couldn't have known.
- I was 23. I... I just didn't care.

01:50:28.660 --> 01:50:30.030
What did you do next?

01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:37.080
Some photographs, I think,
in the front of my bag.

01:50:39.170 --> 01:50:43.300
I was as good a dancer
as I was ever gonna be.

01:50:45.180 --> 01:50:47.130
For five years, I...

01:50:49.890 --> 01:50:51.680
I danced everywhere.

01:50:53.100 --> 01:50:56.640
London, Vienna, Prague.

01:50:57.230 --> 01:50:59.100
I've never seen these.

01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:03.530
Mom.

01:51:04.780 --> 01:51:07.490
You never talked about your dancing.

01:51:07.570 --> 01:51:09.620
Well, I was the only American

01:51:09.700 --> 01:51:14.660
to be invited to dance
with the Bolshoi, sugar.

01:51:16.500 --> 01:51:18.540
It was glorious.

01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:26.720
But Benjamin was never far
from my thoughts.

01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:33.430
And I'd find myself saying...

01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:35.350
Good night, Benjamin.

01:51:37.310 --> 01:51:40.980
- "Good night, Daisy."
- He said that?

01:51:43.110 --> 01:51:44.270
"Life wasn't all that complicated.

01:51:45.150 --> 01:51:47.950
"If you want, you might say
I was looking for something."

01:51:57.410 --> 01:52:00.420
Benjamin?
Mrs. La Tourneau just passed.

01:52:06.800 --> 01:52:10.470
- Letter for Mr. Benjamin Button?
- That'd be me.

01:52:13.350 --> 01:52:14.720
Thank you.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:42.920
Miss Daisy Fuller.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.840
- Just a minute. Please have a seat.
- Sure.

01:52:53.300 --> 01:52:57.720
Sometimes we're on a collision course
and we just don't know it.

01:52:58.270 --> 01:53:02.810
Whether it's by accident or by design,
there's not a thing we can do about it.

01:53:05.610 --> 01:53:08.690
A woman in Paris was on her way
to go shopping.

01:53:10.030 --> 01:53:13.780
But she had forgotten her coat,
went back to get it.

01:53:13.870 --> 01:53:16.070
When she had gotten her coat,
the phone had rung.

01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:19.200
So she had stopped to answer it
and talked for a couple of minutes.

01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:22.460
While the woman was on the phone,

01:53:22.540 --> 01:53:26.750
Daisy was rehearsing for a performance
at the Paris Opera House.

01:53:26.840 --> 01:53:29.630
And while she was rehearsing,
the woman, off the phone now,

01:53:29.710 --> 01:53:32.050
had gone outside to get a taxi.

01:53:36.550 --> 01:53:38.850
Now, a taxi driver had
dropped off a fare earlier,

01:53:38.930 --> 01:53:41.680
and had stopped to get a cup of coffee.

01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:45.310
And all the while, Daisy was rehearsing.

01:53:48.820 --> 01:53:51.320
And this cab driver,
who dropped off the earlier fare

01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:53.400
and had stopped
to get the cup of coffee,

01:53:53.490 --> 01:53:55.200
he picked up the lady
who was going shopping

01:53:55.280 --> 01:53:58.030
and had missed getting the earlier cab.

01:53:58.950 --> 01:54:01.370
The taxi had to stop
for a man crossing the street,

01:54:01.450 --> 01:54:04.290
who had left for work five minutes later
than he normally did

01:54:04.370 --> 01:54:06.920
because he forgot to set his alarm.

01:54:07.670 --> 01:54:10.960
While that man, late for work,
was crossing the street,

01:54:11.050 --> 01:54:14.510
Daisy had finished rehearsing
and was taking a shower.

01:54:15.010 --> 01:54:16.340
And while Daisy was showering,

01:54:16.430 --> 01:54:20.060
the taxi was waiting outside a boutique
for the woman to pick up a package

01:54:20.140 --> 01:54:21.270
which hadn't been wrapped yet,

01:54:21.350 --> 01:54:23.180
because the girl
who was supposed to wrap it

01:54:23.270 --> 01:54:26.900
had broken up with her boyfriend
the night before and forgot.

01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:30.730
When the package was wrapped,
the woman, who was back in the cab,

01:54:30.820 --> 01:54:32.480
was blocked by a delivery truck.

01:54:32.570 --> 01:54:35.320
All the while,
Daisy was getting dressed.

01:54:36.780 --> 01:54:40.200
The delivery truck pulled away,
and the taxi was able to move

01:54:40.290 --> 01:54:42.370
while Daisy, the last to be dressed,

01:54:42.450 --> 01:54:46.040
waited for one of her friends
who had broken a shoelace.

01:54:46.460 --> 01:54:49.380
While the taxi was stopped,
waiting for a traffic light,

01:54:49.460 --> 01:54:53.380
Daisy and her friend
came out the back of the theater.

01:54:53.460 --> 01:54:56.880
And if only one thing
had happened differently,

01:54:56.970 --> 01:54:59.050
if that shoelace hadn't broken

01:54:59.140 --> 01:55:01.680
or that delivery truck
had moved moments earlier

01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:03.640
or that package
had been wrapped and ready

01:55:03.730 --> 01:55:06.480
because the girl hadn't broken up
with her boyfriend,

01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:10.230
or that man had set his alarm
and got up five minutes earlier

01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:13.530
or that taxi driver hadn't stopped
for a cup of coffee

01:55:13.610 --> 01:55:17.650
or that woman had remembered
her coat and got into an earlier cab,

01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:20.870
Daisy and her friend
would have crossed the street

01:55:20.950 --> 01:55:23.410
and the taxi would have driven by.

01:55:34.460 --> 01:55:36.210
But, life being what it is,

01:55:36.300 --> 01:55:39.300
a series of intersecting lives
and incidents

01:55:39.390 --> 01:55:41.180
out of anyone's control,

01:55:42.010 --> 01:55:44.770
that taxi did not go by,

01:55:44.850 --> 01:55:47.680
and that driver was
momentarily distracted.

01:55:48.690 --> 01:55:49.690
Daisy!

01:55:49.850 --> 01:55:51.100
And that taxi hit Daisy.

01:55:51.190 --> 01:55:52.940
Daisy! Help!

01:55:56.070 --> 01:55:58.070
And her leg was crushed.

01:56:05.450 --> 01:56:06.660
Daisy?

01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:13.500
- Who told you?
- Your friend wired me.

01:56:14.550 --> 01:56:18.630
Very kind of you to come all this way
to see that I was all right.

01:56:20.180 --> 01:56:22.220
You'd do the same for me.

01:56:24.100 --> 01:56:25.350
My God.

01:56:27.430 --> 01:56:30.940
Look at you. You're perfect.

01:56:33.730 --> 01:56:38.280
I wish you hadn't come here.
I don't want you to see me like this.

01:56:44.700 --> 01:56:46.990
Her leg had been broken in five places.

01:56:47.080 --> 01:56:50.250
And with therapy and time,
she might walk again.

01:56:51.750 --> 01:56:53.670
But she'd never dance.

01:56:55.250 --> 01:56:57.710
I'm gonna take you home with me.

01:56:57.800 --> 01:57:00.590
- I want to look after you.
- I'm not going back to New Orleans.

01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:02.880
Then I'll stay here in Paris.

01:57:03.470 --> 01:57:06.430
Don't you understand?
I don't want your help.

01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:11.850
I know I'm feeling sorry for myself,
but I don't want to be with you.

01:57:11.940 --> 01:57:15.730
Tried to tell you that in New York.
You don't listen.

01:57:17.230 --> 01:57:19.190
You might change your mind.

01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:22.280
We are not little children
anymore, Benjamin.

01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:27.530
Just stay out of my life.

01:57:50.350 --> 01:57:53.640
I was awfully cruel.

01:57:54.690 --> 01:58:00.150
He didn't understand.
I couldn't have him see me like that.

01:58:02.820 --> 01:58:04.200
"I didn't leave right away.

01:58:06.820 --> 01:58:10.160
"I stayed in Paris for a while
to look out for her."

01:58:13.710 --> 01:58:15.580
I never knew that.

01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:23.050
Oh, darling, could you get the nurse?

01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:31.850
I taught myself to walk again.

01:58:34.890 --> 01:58:37.480
I took the train to Lourdes.

01:58:38.820 --> 01:58:44.400
Let's take a look. That's normal.
Pulse rate is slowing.

01:58:44.490 --> 01:58:46.490
She is gonna struggle to breathe.

01:58:46.570 --> 01:58:48.820
- Will you be all right?
- Yeah.

01:59:01.960 --> 01:59:07.880
All right, he says, "I went back home."
And then there's a lot of pages torn out.

01:59:08.090 --> 01:59:11.850
"I listened to the sound of the house."
I read that already.

01:59:12.720 --> 01:59:13.850
He...

01:59:14.770 --> 01:59:18.060
He spilt something on it,
so it's hard to read, Mom.

01:59:19.190 --> 01:59:21.980
Something about sailing,
does that make sense?

01:59:22.690 --> 01:59:26.070
I learned to sail an old boat
of my father's from the lake house.

01:59:35.250 --> 01:59:37.250
I can't lie.

01:59:37.330 --> 01:59:40.170
I did enjoy the company
of a woman or two.

01:59:48.470 --> 01:59:50.050
Or maybe three.

02:00:26.550 --> 02:00:30.800
Don't know why you bother, Sam,
just gonna be there again tomorrow.

02:00:35.140 --> 02:00:36.310
Mama.

02:00:41.150 --> 02:00:43.650
And in the spring of 1962,

02:00:47.490 --> 02:00:49.030
she came back.

02:01:08.380 --> 02:01:12.050
- You want to know where I've been?
- No.

02:01:14.010 --> 02:01:18.930
How come you didn't write or nothing?
Just disappearing like that.

02:01:19.020 --> 02:01:21.600
It was something I needed to do
for myself.

02:01:21.690 --> 02:01:25.440
Yeah, well, I never took you
to be the selfish type.

02:01:25.520 --> 02:01:28.020
I sure hope I'm not wrong.

02:01:29.150 --> 02:01:31.240
I'm usually not wrong about people.

02:01:31.320 --> 02:01:33.860
- Good night, Mama.
- Good night, baby.

02:01:34.820 --> 02:01:36.490
Y'all have fun.

02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:43.580
- You haven't said two words.
- I don't want to ruin it.

02:02:13.740 --> 02:02:16.070
- Sleep with me?
- Absolutely.

02:02:53.820 --> 02:02:56.280
I asked her to come away with me.

02:02:58.490 --> 02:03:01.620
We sailed into the Gulf
along the Florida Keys.

02:03:42.950 --> 02:03:47.330
I am so glad we didn't find one another
when I was 26.

02:03:47.420 --> 02:03:51.750
- Why do you say that?
- I was so young.

02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:53.630
And you were so old.

02:03:54.300 --> 02:03:57.220
It happened
when it was supposed to happen.

02:03:57.300 --> 02:04:00.470
I will enjoy each and every moment
I have with you.

02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:08.100
I bet I can stay out here longer than you.

02:04:08.190 --> 02:04:09.810
I bet you can't.

02:04:12.650 --> 02:04:15.190
Barely a line or a crease.

02:04:15.570 --> 02:04:18.740
Every day I have more wrinkles.
It's not fair.

02:04:20.360 --> 02:04:24.160
I love your wrinkles. Both of them.

02:04:29.830 --> 02:04:32.170
What's it like growing younger?

02:04:34.590 --> 02:04:39.220
I can't really say.
I'm always looking out my own eyes.

02:04:44.220 --> 02:04:48.020
Will you still love me
when my skin grows old and saggy?

02:04:48.100 --> 02:04:52.600
Will you still love me when I have acne?
When I wet the bed?

02:04:53.900 --> 02:04:56.770
When I'm afraid
of what's under the stairs?

02:05:04.240 --> 02:05:05.330
What?

02:05:11.330 --> 02:05:15.340
- What are you thinking?
- Well, I was thinking how nothing lasts.

02:05:17.710 --> 02:05:19.760
And what a shame that is.

02:05:22.720 --> 02:05:24.390
Some things last.

02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:30.890
- Good night, Daisy.
- Good night, Benjamin.

02:05:47.280 --> 02:05:48.370
Mom?

02:05:50.620 --> 02:05:54.670
- When did you meet Dad?
- Some time after that.

02:05:57.800 --> 02:06:02.550
- Did you tell him about this Benjamin?
- He knew enough, darling.

02:06:22.530 --> 02:06:23.650
Mama?

02:06:30.830 --> 02:06:32.120
Queenie?

02:06:35.250 --> 02:06:36.580
Hello?

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:40.630
Oh, hi, Mrs. Carter, it's Benjamin.
Where is everybody?

02:06:40.710 --> 02:06:45.930
Oh, Benjamin. Queenie died.
I'm so sorry.

02:07:14.580 --> 02:07:18.000
I'm so sorry for your loss.
She was a great woman.

02:07:18.080 --> 02:07:19.920
Our deepest condolences.

02:07:25.050 --> 02:07:28.090
We buried her
beside her beloved Mr. Weathers.

02:07:35.060 --> 02:07:38.560
And so we might have memories
of our own,

02:07:38.650 --> 02:07:40.610
we sold my father's house
on Esplanade.

02:07:40.690 --> 02:07:43.320
It is a wonderful old place, darling.

02:07:43.900 --> 02:07:46.820
I think we are going to be
so happy here.

02:07:46.900 --> 02:07:49.820
Oh, what a long family history you have.

02:07:49.910 --> 02:07:51.910
They come with the house.

02:07:54.500 --> 02:07:57.410
- Come on.
- You have to see the master suite.

02:07:58.920 --> 02:08:01.170
We bought ourselves a duplex.

02:08:03.210 --> 02:08:05.250
I loved that house.

02:08:07.680 --> 02:08:09.680
It smelled like firewood.

02:08:10.760 --> 02:08:14.010
Don't... Don't stop, darling.

02:08:14.600 --> 02:08:17.480
"It was one of the happiest times
of my life."

02:08:17.560 --> 02:08:20.100
We didn't have a stick of furniture.

02:08:20.900 --> 02:08:23.650
We would have picnics
in the living room.

02:08:27.110 --> 02:08:31.110
We ate when we felt like it.
Stayed up all night when we wanted.

02:08:32.530 --> 02:08:34.530
We vowed never to fall into routine,

02:08:34.620 --> 02:08:37.500
to go to bed or wake up
at the same time.

02:08:37.580 --> 02:08:39.620
We lived on that mattress.

02:09:15.330 --> 02:09:18.830
Our neighbor, a Mrs. Van Dam,
was a physical therapist.

02:09:20.410 --> 02:09:23.170
We lived four blocks from a public pool.

02:10:01.540 --> 02:10:04.330
You know, you might've got
a few more years out of it,

02:10:04.420 --> 02:10:08.540
but you chose to do
something so special and unique

02:10:09.960 --> 02:10:13.720
that there was only
a short window of time you could do it.

02:10:15.510 --> 02:10:18.010
So, even if nothing ever happened,

02:10:18.100 --> 02:10:21.220
you'd still be right here
where you are now.

02:10:21.310 --> 02:10:23.560
I just don't like getting old.

02:10:25.100 --> 02:10:27.650
They put too much chlorine in here.

02:11:08.900 --> 02:11:12.780
I promise you I'll never lose myself
to self-pity again.

02:11:17.110 --> 02:11:20.200
And I think right there and then

02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:24.290
she realized
none of us is perfect forever.

02:11:28.250 --> 02:11:29.880
She found peace.

02:11:31.750 --> 02:11:34.670
She opened a studio
and taught young girls how to dance.

02:11:34.760 --> 02:11:37.880
And tendu.

02:11:37.970 --> 02:11:43.060
Come back the other way.
And spot, spot, spot. Excellent.

02:11:44.730 --> 02:11:47.180
- Good night, Miss Daisy.
- Good night.

02:12:12.670 --> 02:12:15.300
You certainly are beautiful to watch.

02:12:17.090 --> 02:12:19.510
Dancing's all about the line.

02:12:21.760 --> 02:12:23.680
The line of your body.

02:12:25.020 --> 02:12:29.350
Sooner or later, you lose that line,
and you never get it back.

02:12:35.230 --> 02:12:41.200
I figure, you were born in 1918,
49 years ago.

02:12:41.280 --> 02:12:42.820
I'm 43.

02:12:44.990 --> 02:12:47.540
We are almost the same age.

02:12:50.830 --> 02:12:55.040
- We're meeting in the middle.
- We finally caught up with each other.

02:12:56.210 --> 02:12:57.340
Wait.

02:12:58.670 --> 02:13:01.340
I want to remember us
just as we are now.

02:13:12.190 --> 02:13:13.690
I'm pregnant.

02:13:31.370 --> 02:13:35.040
You know, I swear the nurse slipped
and said it was a boy.

02:13:50.020 --> 02:13:52.020
But I think it's a girl.

02:13:57.320 --> 02:14:00.900
- I know you're afraid.
- I'm not hiding it.

02:14:00.990 --> 02:14:02.110
Okay.

02:14:09.450 --> 02:14:12.040
- What's your worst fear?
- Baby born like me.

02:14:12.120 --> 02:14:14.580
Then I will love it all the more.

02:14:16.590 --> 02:14:21.550
Okay. How can I be a father
when I'm heading in the other direction?

02:14:22.170 --> 02:14:25.510
It's not fair to a child.
I don't want to be anybody's burden.

02:14:25.590 --> 02:14:28.470
Sugar, we all end up in diapers.

02:14:29.930 --> 02:14:31.970
I am gonna make this work.

02:14:34.640 --> 02:14:37.560
I want this, and I want it with you.

02:14:37.650 --> 02:14:41.070
I want you to have everything you want,
all of it.

02:14:41.150 --> 02:14:44.360
I'm just not sure how to reconcile this.

02:14:44.450 --> 02:14:46.530
Would you tell a blind man
he couldn't have children?

02:14:46.620 --> 02:14:48.200
Here you go.

02:14:48.280 --> 02:14:51.740
You'll be a father for as long as you can.

02:14:51.830 --> 02:14:54.620
I know the consequences.
I've accepted that.

02:14:54.710 --> 02:14:57.330
Loving you is worth everything to me.

02:15:01.840 --> 02:15:03.510
I have to go pee.

02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:19.810
The oldest woman
to ever swim the English Channel

02:15:19.900 --> 02:15:21.650
arrived here today in Calais...

02:15:21.730 --> 02:15:24.240
- Keep it.
...having made the swim in 34 hours,

02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:26.530
22 minutes and 14 seconds.

02:15:26.610 --> 02:15:31.450
The 68-year-old Elizabeth Abbott
arrived at 5:38 Greenwich mean time,

02:15:31.540 --> 02:15:33.330
exhausted but happy.

02:15:33.410 --> 02:15:36.960
Miss Abbott, how would you sum up,
in words, this achievement?

02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:38.670
I suppose...

02:15:40.040 --> 02:15:41.790
Anything's possible.

02:15:45.800 --> 02:15:46.970
- All right?
- Yes. Thank you.

02:15:47.050 --> 02:15:48.050
- You ready?
- Thank you very much.

02:15:48.140 --> 02:15:50.090
Thank you. Thank you all.

02:15:50.180 --> 02:15:52.180
- Yeah.
- You're very kind.

02:15:59.400 --> 02:16:03.270
In the spring, on a day like any other...

02:16:04.030 --> 02:16:06.030
I'll be back in an hour!

02:16:11.030 --> 02:16:12.240
Honey?

02:16:14.290 --> 02:16:16.330
Go and call an ambulance!

02:16:19.250 --> 02:16:20.920
The baby's coming.

02:16:21.750 --> 02:16:22.790
Operator, I need an ambulance.

02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:25.340
- The baby's coming!
- 2714 Napoleon.

02:16:32.549 --> 02:16:35.260
There you go. Keep breathing.

02:16:36.139 --> 02:16:38.559
Deep breaths. Push.

02:16:48.450 --> 02:16:49.860
There we go.

02:17:06.250 --> 02:17:09.629
Everyone's fine.
She's a perfectly healthy baby girl.

02:17:16.510 --> 02:17:17.719
Honey?

02:17:19.639 --> 02:17:23.309
She gave birth to a five pound,
four ounce baby girl.

02:17:39.500 --> 02:17:41.410
Did you count the toes?

02:17:45.709 --> 02:17:47.250
She's perfect.

02:17:47.670 --> 02:17:50.969
"And we named her
for my mother, Caroline."

02:17:54.680 --> 02:17:56.850
This Benjamin was my father?

02:17:58.350 --> 02:18:00.520
And this is how you tell me?

02:18:06.059 --> 02:18:07.440
Excuse me.

02:18:17.910 --> 02:18:20.660
...because all the ingredients are there
for a major storm,

02:18:20.750 --> 02:18:23.330
possibly even up to a Category 5.

02:18:30.049 --> 02:18:33.760
Hey, I know it's hard.
You can't smoke in here.

02:18:37.010 --> 02:18:39.010
Nobody can tell you exactly
where it's gonna hit,

02:18:39.100 --> 02:18:41.219
but we have to go with the guidance
that we have,

02:18:41.309 --> 02:18:45.059
incorporate that information
and then pass it along to you.

02:18:51.900 --> 02:18:56.740
"You grew as the doctor had promised,
normal and healthy."

02:19:05.420 --> 02:19:08.540
You're gonna have to find a real father
for her.

02:19:11.670 --> 02:19:13.459
What are you talking about?

02:19:13.549 --> 02:19:16.840
She's gonna need someone
to grow old with.

02:19:16.930 --> 02:19:19.760
She'll learn to accept
whatever happens. She loves you.

02:19:19.850 --> 02:19:22.600
Honey, she needs a father,
not a playmate.

02:19:26.730 --> 02:19:28.020
- Is it me?
- Of course not.

02:19:28.100 --> 02:19:30.110
- Is my age beginning to bother you?
- Of course not.

02:19:30.190 --> 02:19:34.230
- Is that what you're telling me?
- You can't raise the both of us.

02:19:42.870 --> 02:19:47.790
It was your first birthday.
We had a party for you.

02:19:48.540 --> 02:19:50.380
The house was filled with children.

02:19:50.460 --> 02:19:52.420
- How are you?
- Hey, man.

02:19:52.500 --> 02:19:56.170
Before you turn around,
they'll be in high school, dating.

02:20:28.580 --> 02:20:32.580
I sold the summer house
on Lake Pontchartrain,

02:20:32.670 --> 02:20:35.420
I sold Button's Buttons,

02:20:35.510 --> 02:20:40.050
I sold my father's sailboat,
put it all into a savings account.

02:20:42.300 --> 02:20:45.510
And so that you
and your mother might have a life,

02:20:46.720 --> 02:20:50.690
I left,
before you could ever remember me.

02:21:40.360 --> 02:21:42.570
"I left with just the clothes on my back."

02:21:43.910 --> 02:21:48.580
I don't want to read this now.
Can you just tell me where he went?

02:21:50.040 --> 02:21:52.290
I don't really know.

02:22:03.550 --> 02:22:08.510
It's for me. 1970. I was two.
"Happy Birthday.

02:22:11.270 --> 02:22:14.140
"I wish
I could have kissed you good night."

02:22:19.230 --> 02:22:20.980
They're all for me.

02:22:21.990 --> 02:22:26.990
Five. "I wish I could have taken you
to your first day of school."

02:22:31.500 --> 02:22:37.380
Six. "I wish I could have been there
to teach you to play piano."

02:22:40.800 --> 02:22:43.760
1981, 13.

02:22:43.840 --> 02:22:47.180
"I wish I could have told you
not to chase some boy.

02:22:48.470 --> 02:22:52.140
"I wish I could have held you
when you had a broken heart.

02:22:53.640 --> 02:22:59.440
"I wish I could have been your father.
Nothing I ever did will replace that."

02:23:06.910 --> 02:23:09.450
I guess he went to India.

02:23:09.530 --> 02:23:11.990
"For what it's worth, it's never too late,

02:23:12.080 --> 02:23:13.910
- "or, in my case, too early..."
...or, in my case, too early,

02:23:15.160 --> 02:23:17.170
to be whoever you want to be.

02:23:21.170 --> 02:23:23.880
There's no time limit.
Start whenever you want.

02:23:26.760 --> 02:23:31.260
You can change or stay the same.
There are no rules to this thing.

02:23:33.810 --> 02:23:37.310
We can make the best or the worst of it.

02:23:37.400 --> 02:23:39.730
And I hope you make the best of it.

02:23:42.820 --> 02:23:45.530
I hope you see things that startle you.

02:23:47.700 --> 02:23:51.200
I hope you feel things
you never felt before.

02:23:53.660 --> 02:23:57.210
I hope you meet people
with a different point of view.

02:23:58.330 --> 02:24:01.040
I hope you live a life you're proud of.

02:24:04.050 --> 02:24:09.090
And if you find that you're not,
I hope you have the strength

02:24:09.180 --> 02:24:12.390
- to start all over again.
- "...start all over again."

02:24:13.930 --> 02:24:17.680
He had been gone a long time.

02:24:19.440 --> 02:24:21.560
I'll see you next Thursday.

02:24:24.530 --> 02:24:27.900
- Good night, Miss Daisy.
- Oh, good night, sweetheart.

02:24:45.760 --> 02:24:47.760
I'm sorry, we're closing.

02:24:50.680 --> 02:24:52.260
Can I help you?

02:24:53.810 --> 02:24:56.260
Are you here to pick somebody up?

02:25:06.610 --> 02:25:08.490
Why did you come back?

02:25:10.070 --> 02:25:13.490
Mom?

02:25:14.700 --> 02:25:16.240
You ready yet?

02:25:19.210 --> 02:25:20.330
Mom, what's wrong?

02:25:20.420 --> 02:25:24.000
I was just hearing a very sad story
about a mutual friend

02:25:24.090 --> 02:25:26.800
who I hadn't seen for a very long time.

02:25:28.050 --> 02:25:30.800
Caroline, this is Benjamin.

02:25:30.880 --> 02:25:33.640
You knew him
when you were just a baby.

02:25:36.060 --> 02:25:37.310
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:25:39.230 --> 02:25:41.140
Hey.

02:25:43.100 --> 02:25:47.940
- Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were done.
- Oh, this is a friend of my family's.

02:25:48.030 --> 02:25:52.990
Benjamin Button,
this is my husband, Robert.

02:25:53.070 --> 02:25:55.490
- How do you do?
- A pleasure.

02:26:03.620 --> 02:26:06.630
Well, it was very nice to meet you.

02:26:06.710 --> 02:26:08.550
- We'll be in the car, darling.
- All right.

02:26:08.630 --> 02:26:09.800
Bye.

02:26:10.510 --> 02:26:12.300
I'm just locking up.

02:26:17.010 --> 02:26:18.140
Wow.

02:26:20.640 --> 02:26:23.520
She's beautiful. Like her mother.

02:26:25.100 --> 02:26:27.610
- Does she dance?
- Not very well.

02:26:27.690 --> 02:26:29.610
I guess that'd be
from my side of things.

02:26:29.690 --> 02:26:31.690
She's a dear, sweet girl.

02:26:32.860 --> 02:26:37.240
She seems a little lost.
But then, who isn't at 12?

02:26:37.410 --> 02:26:41.700
A lot of her reminds me of you.

02:26:42.540 --> 02:26:46.540
My husband, he's a widower, or was...
Was a widower.

02:26:46.880 --> 02:26:50.840
He's an incredibly kind, just bright,
adventurous man.

02:26:53.970 --> 02:26:56.720
- He's been a terrific father.
- Good.

02:27:01.390 --> 02:27:05.310
- You are so much younger.
- Only on the outside.

02:27:07.400 --> 02:27:08.940
You were right.

02:27:10.690 --> 02:27:14.070
I couldn't have been raising both of you.

02:27:14.150 --> 02:27:15.950
I'm not that strong.

02:27:20.120 --> 02:27:22.200
So, where are you staying?

02:27:24.830 --> 02:27:25.830
What are you gonna do?

02:27:25.920 --> 02:27:29.750
I'm staying at the Pontchartrain Hotel
on the Avenue.

02:27:29.840 --> 02:27:33.380
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

02:27:33.460 --> 02:27:34.670
But...

02:27:41.140 --> 02:27:42.810
They're waiting.

02:28:24.930 --> 02:28:28.230
I remember that. That was him?

02:28:30.860 --> 02:28:32.060
The hurricane has changed directions.

02:28:32.150 --> 02:28:33.980
It's going to make landfall
sometime soon.

02:28:34.070 --> 02:28:35.820
- Am I supposed to do something?
- Arrangements are being made

02:28:35.900 --> 02:28:37.150
to move people, but it's up to you.

02:28:37.240 --> 02:28:39.110
No. No, we're... We're staying.

02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:41.870
I'll let you know if anything changes.

02:28:43.870 --> 02:28:48.250
"That night, while I was sitting
and wondering why I came back at all,

02:28:48.330 --> 02:28:50.670
"there was a knock at the door."

02:28:54.300 --> 02:28:55.550
Come in.

02:29:09.850 --> 02:29:11.520
Are you all right?

02:29:14.610 --> 02:29:18.740
I'm sorry,
I don't know what I'm doing here.

02:29:27.750 --> 02:29:29.290
Nothing lasts.

02:29:32.710 --> 02:29:35.090
I have never stopped loving you.

02:29:41.050 --> 02:29:43.800
Oh, but, Benjamin,
I'm an old woman now.

02:29:54.400 --> 02:29:56.650
Some things you never forget.

02:30:16.920 --> 02:30:18.000
...so few people even know

02:30:18.090 --> 02:30:19.800
that you were ever in jail
in the first place.

02:30:19.880 --> 02:30:22.090
I'll tell you, I am sick about it, too,

02:30:22.170 --> 02:30:24.760
because, please,
if they're not gonna give you an award

02:30:24.840 --> 02:30:26.930
like "Man of the Year,"
at least what they could do

02:30:27.010 --> 02:30:29.680
is stop having you listed
as an ex-convict

02:30:29.770 --> 02:30:32.310
which I think is, again, so unfair.

02:30:45.070 --> 02:30:46.910
Good night, Benjamin.

02:30:48.410 --> 02:30:50.120
Good night, Daisy.

02:30:53.290 --> 02:30:57.540
And as I knew I would,
I watched her go.

02:31:00.250 --> 02:31:02.590
That's the last thing he wrote.

02:31:03.720 --> 02:31:08.300
Sometime after your father passed,

02:31:08.390 --> 02:31:11.260
there was a call.

02:31:14.310 --> 02:31:15.480
Hello.

02:31:16.560 --> 02:31:18.100
Yes, speaking.

02:31:21.400 --> 02:31:23.900
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

02:31:33.700 --> 02:31:35.620
It's the corner house.

02:31:57.770 --> 02:31:59.190
Come on in.

02:32:04.740 --> 02:32:06.780
- I'm Daisy Fuller.
- I'm David Hernandez,

02:32:06.860 --> 02:32:10.620
with the Orleans Parish Department
of Child Welfare Services.

02:32:10.700 --> 02:32:13.370
He was living in a condemned building.

02:32:15.120 --> 02:32:17.460
The police found this with him.

02:32:17.540 --> 02:32:20.500
This address.
It's got your name in it a lot.

02:32:21.670 --> 02:32:24.300
He's in very poor health.
He was taken to the hospital.

02:32:24.380 --> 02:32:28.470
He doesn't seem to know who
or where he is. He's very confused.

02:32:28.550 --> 02:32:32.140
I was telling Mr. Hernandez
that Benjamin is one of us.

02:32:32.220 --> 02:32:36.060
If he needs a place to stay,
it's all right, he can stay here.

02:33:05.500 --> 02:33:06.800
Benjamin?

02:33:10.630 --> 02:33:12.470
You play beautifully.

02:33:15.930 --> 02:33:17.810
He doesn't seem to like to be touched.

02:33:17.890 --> 02:33:19.560
He goes in and out
of states of recognition.

02:33:19.640 --> 02:33:21.310
The doctors say,
if they didn't know any better,

02:33:21.400 --> 02:33:23.860
he has the beginnings of dementia.

02:33:25.610 --> 02:33:27.400
Do you remember me?

02:33:30.530 --> 02:33:31.910
I'm Daisy.

02:33:34.450 --> 02:33:35.950
I'm Benjamin.

02:33:41.620 --> 02:33:44.330
It's nice to meet you, Benjamin.

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:51.420
Would you mind if I sit with you?
I would love to hear you play.

02:33:55.260 --> 02:33:56.800
Do I know you?

02:34:01.730 --> 02:34:03.390
- I want some breakfast.
- And every day,

02:34:03.480 --> 02:34:07.440
I would stop by to make sure
that he was comfortable.

02:34:07.520 --> 02:34:10.190
- No, I didn't.
- You just finished eating.

02:34:10.280 --> 02:34:12.610
Don't think I don't know
what you're doing!

02:34:12.700 --> 02:34:15.450
You're all fucking liars!

02:34:15.530 --> 02:34:18.490
He doesn't believe
he just had his breakfast.

02:34:19.790 --> 02:34:23.410
Now, why don't we see

02:34:23.500 --> 02:34:26.920
if we can't find something else
for you to do?

02:34:27.040 --> 02:34:30.260
I have a feeling
there's a lot of things I can't remember.

02:34:30.340 --> 02:34:32.260
Well, like what, sugar?

02:34:33.510 --> 02:34:37.510
It's like there's this whole life I had,

02:34:38.970 --> 02:34:41.390
and I can't remember what it was.

02:34:44.190 --> 02:34:45.520
It's okay.

02:34:47.610 --> 02:34:49.110
It's okay to forget things.

02:34:49.320 --> 02:34:54.900
Many times, he would simply forget
who or where he was.

02:34:55.200 --> 02:34:56.910
There he is, he's up there on the roof.

02:34:56.990 --> 02:34:58.700
It wasn't easy.

02:34:58.780 --> 02:35:01.040
- Benjamin!
- I can see everything!

02:35:01.120 --> 02:35:02.910
- I can see the big river!
- That's right,

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:04.750
you can see everything, sweetheart.

02:35:04.830 --> 02:35:06.830
I can see the graveyard
where Mama's buried,

02:35:06.920 --> 02:35:10.300
- and all those other people.
- I want you to come down!

02:35:10.380 --> 02:35:14.170
- What if I could fly?
- I knew a man who could fly.

02:35:15.130 --> 02:35:18.140
You come down
and I'll tell you all about him.

02:35:21.680 --> 02:35:23.310
Somebody go up there.

02:35:29.900 --> 02:35:32.860
He was five when I moved in.

02:35:32.940 --> 02:35:37.450
Nearly the same age I was
when I had met him.

02:35:43.410 --> 02:35:47.370
"This is the picture
of Old Man Kangaroo

02:35:47.460 --> 02:35:49.920
"at 5:00 in the afternoon

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:53.500
"when he had got
his beautiful hind legs."

02:35:54.720 --> 02:35:56.010
The days passed.

02:35:56.090 --> 02:36:00.390
And I watched as he forgot how to walk

02:36:05.600 --> 02:36:08.060
- and how to talk.
- What's my name?

02:36:08.480 --> 02:36:09.850
I'm Daisy.

02:36:10.980 --> 02:36:12.770
Can you say "Daisy"?

02:36:14.320 --> 02:36:19.610
In 2002, they put up a new clock
in that train station.

02:36:26.460 --> 02:36:30.250
And in the spring of 2003,

02:36:34.590 --> 02:36:36.300
he looked at me

02:36:38.760 --> 02:36:43.850
and I knew that he knew who I was.

02:36:47.350 --> 02:36:53.190
And then he closed his eyes
as if to go to sleep.

02:37:25.720 --> 02:37:29.930
- I wish I'd known him.
- Now you do.

02:37:34.400 --> 02:37:38.190
Mom, I think I should go see
what's going on.

02:37:45.200 --> 02:37:47.290
Good night, Benjamin.

02:38:09.640 --> 02:38:12.020
We're expecting flash flooding
after the levee break.

02:38:12.100 --> 02:38:14.400
It occurred in the Ninth Ward.

02:38:17.400 --> 02:38:20.230
Some people are born to sit by a river.

02:38:21.740 --> 02:38:23.740
Some get struck by lightning.

02:38:25.570 --> 02:38:27.740
Some have an ear for music.

02:38:29.290 --> 02:38:30.950
Some are artists.

02:38:32.250 --> 02:38:33.620
Some swim.

02:38:35.040 --> 02:38:36.710
Some know buttons.

02:38:38.460 --> 02:38:39.880
Some know Shakespeare.

02:38:41.010 --> 02:38:42.800
Some are mothers.

02:38:44.760 --> 02:38:47.000
And some people dance.
