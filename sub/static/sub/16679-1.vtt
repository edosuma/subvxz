00:19.760 --> 00:25.164
For as long as can be remembered,
storks delivered babies

00:27.040 --> 00:30.169
from their perch on Stork Mountain.

00:30.320 --> 00:34.211
It was an honor and a privilege to serve.

00:35.360 --> 00:39.001
It was our duty, our core belief,

00:39.160 --> 00:42.926
the driving force of our very lifeblood.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.490
Aw... Ow!

00:48.120 --> 00:49.645
It wasn't always easy.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.040
Oh...

00:51.200 --> 00:53.771
This was our challenge.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.765
This was our sacred duty.

00:56.160 --> 00:58.162
No matter how tough or impossible

00:58.480 --> 01:02.565
or brutal or harsh or inhumane or savage,

01:02.720 --> 01:05.007
we would triumph over adversity.

01:08.320 --> 01:09.560
Phew!

01:20.960 --> 01:22.564
Gotcha!

01:23.560 --> 01:25.130
Oh!

01:25.280 --> 01:27.362
Hey.

01:27.560 --> 01:28.686
- On your right.
- Left.

01:28.840 --> 01:29.841
Bike lane.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.527
Thank goodness we don't do that anymore.

01:35.240 --> 01:36.401
There! Right there!

01:36.680 --> 01:40.930
The problem was, we had the wrong cargo.

01:47.320 --> 01:49.368
Our new phones!

01:49.520 --> 01:53.605
Luckily, now, storks deliver
packages for Cornerstore.com!

01:56.440 --> 01:57.885
- My dude!
- Oh, yeah!

02:02.520 --> 02:04.887
Yo, Kevron! Lookin' good, my man!

02:05.040 --> 02:06.769
Oh, I love this guy!

02:11.960 --> 02:14.201
Perfect landing. Chiggy-check.

02:15.880 --> 02:17.405
You're the man!

02:17.840 --> 02:20.411
What? Millionth package? Not possible.

02:20.560 --> 02:22.210
I thought I was only at 20.

02:22.360 --> 02:23.771
Hey, Junior, are you gonna celebrate?

02:23.920 --> 02:26.241
You know what? You're right.
I should celebrate.

02:26.400 --> 02:27.561
What are you guys doing this weekend?

02:27.720 --> 02:28.721
Are you guys free?

02:28.880 --> 02:30.928
The wife and I
are celebrating another anniversary.

02:31.080 --> 02:32.730
Got my kid's game this weekend.

02:32.920 --> 02:35.526
Family reunion. The whole family's coming.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.961
Oh. Just wanted to confirm.

02:38.160 --> 02:39.161
That you were all busy.

02:39.320 --> 02:40.890
I assumed you were all busy and you are.

02:41.040 --> 02:42.201
So, if anything changes, let me know.

02:42.360 --> 02:43.361
I maybe could get out of work.

02:43.520 --> 02:44.965
Probably can't,
but let me know if you can.

02:45.120 --> 02:47.282
Great job out there, brah!

02:47.440 --> 02:49.010
Thanks, Pigeon Toady.

02:49.160 --> 02:50.969
Check out my girlfriend.

02:51.120 --> 02:52.565
- She's in Canada.
- Yeah-huh.

02:52.720 --> 02:53.721
She migrated.

02:53.880 --> 02:55.450
- She's not made up.
- Okay.

02:55.600 --> 02:57.409
Look at her! Look at her!

02:57.560 --> 02:59.642
- She exists, brah!
- That's great.

02:59.800 --> 03:02.087
Hey, did you guys hear about Roger?

03:02.280 --> 03:03.850
Ah!

03:04.000 --> 03:05.923
Oh, my goodness. Are you okay?

03:06.600 --> 03:09.331
What? Hey, brah. I say... What? Okay.

03:09.480 --> 03:11.130
I tell you about my girlfriend?

03:12.640 --> 03:14.608
Hey, boss wants to see you.

03:14.760 --> 03:15.841
Uh...

03:16.000 --> 03:17.729
Hunter wants to see me?

03:20.520 --> 03:22.682
All right. Head in the game, Junior.

03:22.840 --> 03:24.683
So, you're Hunter.
What do you do around here?

03:26.040 --> 03:27.041
No, I hate that.

03:27.200 --> 03:28.804
Hunter. Nice. To. Meet. You.

03:28.960 --> 03:30.007
No, that's too robot.

03:30.160 --> 03:32.162
Just say it normal. Just say it normal.
Here we go.

03:32.320 --> 03:33.401
Nice to meet you!

03:33.560 --> 03:35.244
What is wrong with me?

03:37.640 --> 03:38.641
Junior.

03:39.200 --> 03:40.247
Hunter.

03:47.880 --> 03:49.928
You know why
I built my office entirely out of glass

03:50.120 --> 03:51.645
even though birds can't see glass?

03:52.320 --> 03:53.446
I do not.

03:55.680 --> 03:57.921
Power move.

03:58.080 --> 04:02.847
Eighteen years ago, I saved all storks
by getting out of babies

04:03.000 --> 04:05.241
and into package delivery.

04:05.400 --> 04:09.887
Now, this Monday at Storkcon, the board
will announce they're kicking me upstairs.

04:10.040 --> 04:11.166
I'm going to be named Chairman.

04:11.360 --> 04:14.011
Which means you are going to be named

04:14.360 --> 04:16.408
boss.

04:17.760 --> 04:18.807
Boss!

04:25.880 --> 04:27.291
Cool, cool, cool. Very cool, very cool.

04:27.440 --> 04:31.206
Now, look upon your domain
with your eyes wide open.

04:31.720 --> 04:33.165
- Yeah.
- Wider.

04:33.320 --> 04:34.367
I love it. Feels good.

04:34.520 --> 04:36.887
How can you be boss
if you can't look at it?

04:37.040 --> 04:39.247
If I go blind, it was worth it.

04:39.400 --> 04:40.970
You know the hardest thing
about bein' boss?

04:41.120 --> 04:42.201
Staring at the sun?

04:42.360 --> 04:43.361
No, this is easy.

04:43.520 --> 04:45.761
Whether to be like a friend boss
or a distant, weird boss?

04:45.920 --> 04:47.843
Always be distant and weird.
What's the matter with you?

04:48.000 --> 04:49.001
Sorry.

04:49.160 --> 04:52.243
No, it's dealing with that.

04:53.600 --> 04:54.726
The orphan Tulip?

04:54.880 --> 04:56.041
I don't understand.

04:56.200 --> 04:59.170
Do you know why
we stopped delivering babies?

04:59.360 --> 05:01.408
Because there are so many
other ways of getting babies?

05:01.560 --> 05:04.848
Yes. But that's not the whole story.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.004
Eighteen years ago,
when we still delivered human infants,

05:08.200 --> 05:13.240
a stork named Jasper
went crazy and tried to keep a baby.

05:14.200 --> 05:15.725
Tulip's beacon broke.

05:15.880 --> 05:19.566
Her address was destroyed,
so we could no longer deliver her.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.529
My baby!

05:21.680 --> 05:26.083
It was then I realized that
there was no future in baby delivery.

05:26.240 --> 05:30.325
Now, the orphan Tulip has just turned 18,
which means we can finally liberate her

05:30.480 --> 05:32.289
and return her to the human world.

05:32.440 --> 05:33.566
But she's no trouble.

05:33.720 --> 05:35.324
Oh, she isn't, is she?

05:35.520 --> 05:37.363
Here's our profit chart.

05:37.560 --> 05:39.130
- I love a good profit chart.
- Me, too.

05:39.280 --> 05:40.281
Yeah!

05:40.480 --> 05:43.643
The peaks are when Tulip is on vacation,
asleep or out with the flu.

05:43.800 --> 05:46.531
The valleys are when she tries to help.

05:46.680 --> 05:49.889
Cool. I will liberate her.
Consider her liberated.

05:50.440 --> 05:52.204
And if she doesn't want to be liberated?

05:52.360 --> 05:53.805
Fire her. I'm talking about firing her.

05:53.960 --> 05:55.007
Really?

05:55.160 --> 05:58.246
The only thing you need to do to be named
boss on Monday is liberate the orphan Tulip.

05:58.400 --> 05:59.811
If I'm not being clear, I mean fire her!

06:00.000 --> 06:01.126
Yes, sir. I am on it.

06:01.280 --> 06:03.442
I have read between the lines
and heard you overtly.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.962
Ow, ow, ow...

06:10.440 --> 06:12.681
Excuse me! Orphan Tulip?

06:13.800 --> 06:14.801
Junior?

06:15.800 --> 06:16.961
You're talkin' to me?

06:17.120 --> 06:18.246
Yes, Orphan Tulip!

06:18.440 --> 06:20.283
No, it's just that you never talk to me.

06:20.480 --> 06:22.482
Well, yeah, that's changing
starting today, Orphan Tulip.

06:22.640 --> 06:24.608
Oh, "Tulip" is just fine.
"Orphan" hurts my heart.

06:24.760 --> 06:26.410
I have so many questions to ask you!

06:26.560 --> 06:28.642
Why don't you come down
and we can talk all day?

06:28.800 --> 06:30.564
Okay. I will be down.

06:30.720 --> 06:31.960
As will my friends.

06:32.160 --> 06:34.481
We are going to fly right down.

06:34.640 --> 06:35.641
What? No, no.

06:35.800 --> 06:37.086
That's a quail, an emu, there's a chicken.

06:37.240 --> 06:38.241
They cannot fly.

06:38.400 --> 06:40.687
Yeah. Until now.

06:40.840 --> 06:42.001
She's helping us achieve our dreams.

06:42.160 --> 06:43.764
- That's right, Dougland.
- You know it.

06:43.960 --> 06:46.531
It is still a personal victory
if you use the bucket.

06:51.480 --> 06:53.130
Okay, we'll all not use the bucket!

06:53.280 --> 06:54.361
Wait, what?

06:54.600 --> 06:56.602
Ha-ha! Tulip doesn't fit in.

06:56.760 --> 06:59.001
We're all the same and she's a weirdo.

06:59.160 --> 07:00.605
Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's not nice. She's...

07:00.760 --> 07:02.285
She's had a hard life.

07:03.560 --> 07:06.689
Okay.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.128
This is gonna be great, guys!

07:09.720 --> 07:11.051
Countdown.

07:11.680 --> 07:14.160
Three, two, one!

07:22.240 --> 07:23.287
Oh.

07:23.480 --> 07:26.211
It's working! We're flying!

07:26.360 --> 07:27.566
Ho-ho! Whoa!

07:28.000 --> 07:29.206
Yeah, yeah!

07:29.680 --> 07:30.806
Yeah!

07:30.960 --> 07:32.803
Enough of this, I wanna go fast!

07:33.680 --> 07:34.727
No! Dougland, wait!

07:34.880 --> 07:36.041
No, no, no!

07:36.200 --> 07:38.043
This is the greatest day of my life!

07:39.560 --> 07:41.085
I'm flying!

07:43.760 --> 07:45.967
This is my moment!

07:46.120 --> 07:48.043
- Dougland! No!
- Get out of my way!

07:50.800 --> 07:51.881
Bad Dougland! No!

07:52.040 --> 07:54.202
How could my dreams go so horribly wrong?

07:56.120 --> 07:57.406
I got ya!

07:57.560 --> 07:58.607
Okay.

07:58.760 --> 07:59.921
I'm fallin'.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.401
Oh, no! No! No, no, no, no, no!

08:19.240 --> 08:20.241
- Uh...
- Oh, boy.

08:23.960 --> 08:26.201
Oh. Oh, that's not so bad.

08:29.680 --> 08:32.842
I got it. I got it. I got it! I got it!

08:33.000 --> 08:34.081
I got it!

08:40.120 --> 08:43.760
I'm sorry! Oh, I'm so, so sorry. Oh!

08:44.120 --> 08:46.646
I don't fit in anywhere
and all I want to do is help!

08:49.880 --> 08:51.450
Oh, boy.

08:51.600 --> 08:54.604
Uh, Tulip, okay. I have news for you.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.802
Before you finish,

08:56.960 --> 08:58.644
for you to come to wish me
a happy birthday,

08:58.800 --> 09:01.406
that's just the nicest, you know?
It's like a little rainbow.

09:01.600 --> 09:02.726
So, thank you.

09:02.880 --> 09:04.211
That's really nice.

09:04.360 --> 09:06.010
But, oh, I'm sorry. I interrupted you.

09:06.160 --> 09:08.288
- What were you gonna tell me?
- Uh...

09:08.640 --> 09:09.641
Oh, boy.

09:09.800 --> 09:12.167
I have wonderful news for you.

09:12.360 --> 09:15.330
You have been liberated.

09:15.960 --> 09:17.644
What does that mean?

09:17.800 --> 09:21.009
Well, it means that you are fired.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.804
- What?
- You're...

09:25.200 --> 09:27.202
Are you okay?

09:29.280 --> 09:31.442
Excuse me. You're...

09:33.440 --> 09:35.204
You're fantastic!

09:36.000 --> 09:37.001
Really?

09:37.160 --> 09:39.686
Because I just blew up
most of the factory.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.046
Oh, yeah.

09:41.200 --> 09:43.726
What a twist! Um...

09:44.560 --> 09:46.164
Well, it means...

09:47.960 --> 09:49.450
Oh.

09:50.560 --> 09:53.370
I'm putting you in charge
of your very own department.

09:53.520 --> 09:57.081
You are the new head of Letter Sorting.

09:59.880 --> 10:01.689
I didn't even know we still got letters.

10:01.840 --> 10:03.604
We do!

10:03.760 --> 10:07.207
- And now, you're in charge of them.
- Oh, yes! I will rock this!

10:07.360 --> 10:08.521
You will rock this!

10:08.680 --> 10:10.205
- Oh, yeah! Rock it hard!
- Gonna rock it hard!

10:10.360 --> 10:12.010
And what's the number-one rule?

10:12.160 --> 10:13.571
Always deliver!

10:13.720 --> 10:15.370
- Wrong. Never leave this room.
- Oh.

10:15.520 --> 10:17.727
I always thought it was
something more like "Strength"!

10:17.880 --> 10:19.882
- "Determination"!
- Nope. That's way off.

10:20.040 --> 10:22.008
Number-one rule, never leave this room.

10:22.160 --> 10:23.764
Okay, well, if that...

10:38.240 --> 10:40.208
Bored, bored, bored.

10:46.320 --> 10:49.005
So, how was your commute?

10:49.840 --> 10:52.684
Oh, I took the bucket.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.649
Me, too. Real backed up.

10:54.840 --> 10:56.251
Oh, yeah.

10:56.800 --> 10:58.404
You hear about Steve and Gloria?

10:58.640 --> 10:59.801
What?

10:59.960 --> 11:01.724
I hear they're an item.

11:01.880 --> 11:02.961
- No.
- Yeah.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.531
Are you kidding me?

11:04.800 --> 11:05.961
Are you guys talking about us?

11:06.120 --> 11:07.884
You guys better not be talking about us.

11:08.040 --> 11:09.610
I told you that in confidence.

11:09.760 --> 11:11.364
You don't make her upset. She's my life!

11:11.560 --> 11:12.766
Oh, no, I said it out loud.

11:12.920 --> 11:14.160
You're not supposed to say anything!

11:14.360 --> 11:15.771
Sorry, guys. Cat's out of the bag!

11:15.920 --> 11:17.729
- No!
- Meow!

11:17.880 --> 11:20.645
Are you gossiping?
No gossip allowed! Go to HR!

11:21.040 --> 11:23.964
I've called you both in because
I hear you've been having problems.

11:24.320 --> 11:26.288
- And it's important we have...
- She's the one who started it!

11:26.440 --> 11:27.441
- How dare you!
- How dare you!

11:27.600 --> 11:29.250
- How dare both of you! You're fired!
- You can't fire me!

11:29.400 --> 11:31.050
- I just did!
- Wait! I'm so sorry, I didn't mean that!

11:31.200 --> 11:32.770
- Guys! Group hug!
- Group hug!

11:33.040 --> 11:34.121
Aw.

11:37.040 --> 11:40.123
I'm hugging myself. Okay.

11:41.600 --> 11:45.685
Somebody write me a letter!

11:49.080 --> 11:50.206
Come in, Ninja Commander.

11:50.360 --> 11:52.966
This is Cowboy Astronaut Agent Nate, over.

11:58.120 --> 12:00.122
Ninja Team Commander, are you in position?

12:00.320 --> 12:01.651
I'm about to launch the assault.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.564
We can absolutely do that.

12:03.800 --> 12:05.325
That's not gonna be a problem.

12:07.800 --> 12:09.564
Ha-ha! Dr. LeFreeze!

12:18.360 --> 12:22.922
You may have me outnumbered 7,000 to one,
but you weren't counting on one thing,

12:23.080 --> 12:24.570
I'm not alone.

12:24.760 --> 12:26.489
Ninja force, attack!

12:29.120 --> 12:30.326
Ninja force?

12:38.560 --> 12:41.404
Oh, ow! No! Oh!

12:41.680 --> 12:43.648
This is the end.

12:43.800 --> 12:48.010
Ninja force, tell my wife I loved her.

12:54.160 --> 12:55.650
Gardner Real Estate. Henry...

12:55.800 --> 12:57.325
- And Sarah...
- ...Gardner!

12:57.480 --> 13:01.041
A house is not a home without a Gardner!

13:01.200 --> 13:03.009
Ninja Commander, where were you?

13:03.160 --> 13:04.969
- Uh, can you hold one second?
- Can you just...

13:05.120 --> 13:07.930
You promised me that we were taking down
Dr. LeFreeze this afternoon.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.127
You didn't show up,

13:09.280 --> 13:11.442
and now he controls
most of Western Europe.

13:11.640 --> 13:12.971
Ethnic tension is on the rise.

13:13.960 --> 13:14.961
Yeah.

13:15.120 --> 13:18.283
- We're totally done after this call, okay?
- Really?

13:18.480 --> 13:20.403
- Five more minutes.
- And then we'll stop.

13:20.560 --> 13:22.130
We promise.

13:22.320 --> 13:24.448
We never stop. That's the Gardner promise.

13:24.600 --> 13:25.601
Not even for five minutes.

13:25.760 --> 13:26.761
Oh, look! There's one of our bench ads.

13:26.920 --> 13:27.921
And you know what it says?

13:28.080 --> 13:29.366
"We never stop."

13:29.560 --> 13:32.086
We never stop. We never stop.

13:32.240 --> 13:33.401
There's a stop sign. We're stopping.

13:33.560 --> 13:34.641
We do stop for that.

13:34.800 --> 13:35.847
I love you, brother.

13:36.040 --> 13:38.407
It's like we're best friends
that live together!

13:38.560 --> 13:39.561
And we yield.

13:39.720 --> 13:41.643
And the yield
you're gonna get on this house, Kyle...

13:41.840 --> 13:43.569
And that's what we were saying,
like you've gotta be up...

13:43.760 --> 13:47.685
Mom, Dad,
I've decided I want a baby brother.

13:49.640 --> 13:51.404
- Oh, honey, can you...
- Can you hold one second?

13:51.680 --> 13:52.920
- Oh...
- Um...

13:53.200 --> 13:55.601
I think we're fine as a family of three.

13:55.760 --> 13:56.761
Why can't I have one?

13:56.920 --> 13:58.922
Let's make this easy.
Where do you get one?

14:01.440 --> 14:03.488
Why are you laughing and not answering me?

14:03.640 --> 14:05.688
Where did you get me?

14:06.000 --> 14:07.001
What is the joke?

14:07.200 --> 14:08.201
Is there a different subject?

14:08.360 --> 14:11.603
Okay, so there's a super weird
vibe in this car right now.

14:11.880 --> 14:13.928
Oh, honey, this is very sweet.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.724
But we have you.

14:16.080 --> 14:17.411
And that's all we need.

14:17.560 --> 14:18.607
That's right.

14:35.960 --> 14:36.961
No, no, no, don't feel bad.

14:37.120 --> 14:38.167
You can call us anytime.

14:38.320 --> 14:39.924
Call us morning, noon or night.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.286
Weekends, holidays.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.130
No, we will pick up the phone
on Christmas.

14:43.280 --> 14:44.327
Oh, well, I don't... Will we?

14:44.480 --> 14:46.084
Yeah, you can call us on Christmas.

15:18.840 --> 15:23.680
"Dear Stork Delivery Service,
"our adult names are Henry and Sarah.

15:23.840 --> 15:27.731
"We are adult parents
of an absolutely perfect son named Nate.

15:27.880 --> 15:29.166
"He really deserves a baby brother.

15:31.520 --> 15:33.363
"As adults, it is our adult belief

15:33.520 --> 15:36.364
"that it would be irresponsible
if this baby did not have ninja skills.

15:36.560 --> 15:41.009
"Sincerely, adult parents
Henry and Sarah Gardner comma adults.

15:41.280 --> 15:42.770
"Not Nate.

15:43.920 --> 15:45.684
"P.S. He has to have ninja skills!"

15:45.880 --> 15:46.881
Hi-ya!

15:49.680 --> 15:50.886
Nailed it.

16:50.080 --> 16:52.924
Happy birthday, dear Tulip!
Happy birthday to you!

16:53.080 --> 16:55.970
Whoo!
Guys, thank you so much! Oh, my gosh.

16:56.160 --> 16:59.004
Don't you think Junior put
you down here to get you out of the way?

16:59.200 --> 17:01.123
Cheryl, that's not fair.
Why would you say that?

17:01.280 --> 17:03.169
What? I can't help it.
I'm your outspoken friend.

17:03.320 --> 17:05.720
I've never done this before,
but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

17:06.560 --> 17:08.164
Aha! A letter!

17:09.960 --> 17:11.371
"The H.I. Department."

17:11.520 --> 17:13.089
Don't know that one.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.527
He said the number-one rule is
"Don't leave."

17:15.720 --> 17:19.770
But if I don't deliver the letter,
I won't be doing my job.

17:19.920 --> 17:21.046
I'll cover for you!

17:21.200 --> 17:22.361
Okay, thanks!

17:24.000 --> 17:25.126
I have excellent news.

17:25.280 --> 17:26.849
I have taken care of the Tulip problem.

17:27.480 --> 17:28.527
Wonderful.

17:29.120 --> 17:31.009
Monday, it'll all be yours.

17:36.840 --> 17:39.889
Barring any monumental screw-up.

17:40.200 --> 17:42.726
Do you know what we'll do
when you're boss?

17:42.880 --> 17:44.370
No. Tell me!

17:44.520 --> 17:45.760
We'll barbecue together.

17:45.960 --> 17:47.291
We'll point at things together.

17:47.440 --> 17:48.487
We'll team-build together.

17:48.640 --> 17:50.324
We'll wear suits together.

17:50.680 --> 17:53.604
You'll never be alone
because Cornerstore is your family.

17:55.320 --> 17:56.526
- What?
- And I'll be like your dad.

17:56.720 --> 17:58.131
And you're like my son.

17:58.280 --> 17:59.805
My son-ployee.

18:00.720 --> 18:02.006
And like any family...

18:02.160 --> 18:03.571
No, no, no, no, no.

18:03.720 --> 18:05.529
No, no, no, no, no, no.

18:05.680 --> 18:07.682
How do you turn this thing off?

18:07.840 --> 18:09.763
...and racquetball and fishing...

18:09.920 --> 18:11.206
Why are there so many screens?

18:11.400 --> 18:12.686
Turn off, turn off, turn off!

18:13.520 --> 18:14.885
You're about to
get everything you ever wanted.

18:20.440 --> 18:21.851
Great convo, Hunter!

18:24.280 --> 18:25.441
I'm so stupid!

18:25.600 --> 18:27.648
I should have just fired her!
Why didn't I just fire her?

18:28.040 --> 18:29.644
Tulip!

18:29.800 --> 18:30.801
Hey!

18:31.000 --> 18:32.047
Hey, what are you doing out of the room?

18:32.200 --> 18:33.201
I told you not to leave the room!

18:33.360 --> 18:34.691
Nah, it's cool. I'm covering for myself.

18:34.880 --> 18:35.881
What?

18:36.040 --> 18:37.371
Okay, we need to get outta here.

18:38.920 --> 18:40.126
Come on. We have to go now.

18:40.280 --> 18:43.727
Junior, you asked me to do a thing,
and I will not fail you!

18:43.880 --> 18:45.530
Always deliver!

18:45.680 --> 18:47.921
Wait! No!

18:55.320 --> 18:56.685
This is the Baby Factory!

18:56.840 --> 18:59.650
This is the Baby Factory?

18:59.880 --> 19:01.723
No, no, no!

19:04.360 --> 19:05.361
See ya!

19:05.520 --> 19:06.646
Why did you do that?

19:06.800 --> 19:08.404
Touchdown Tulip!

19:08.560 --> 19:09.800
Stop celebrating!

19:10.000 --> 19:12.241
I think it was supposed to go over there.

19:14.080 --> 19:15.730
Oh...

19:18.520 --> 19:20.090
You're right. That was wrong.

19:28.720 --> 19:29.767
Oh, come on!

19:29.920 --> 19:31.809
Why didn't we destroy
this place years ago?

19:31.960 --> 19:33.007
Oh, my gosh!

19:33.160 --> 19:34.286
I can't believe what I'm seeing!

19:34.480 --> 19:35.686
Do you see all this?

19:35.840 --> 19:37.649
Junior! This is amazing!

19:44.480 --> 19:46.801
Why put the button there? Uh...

19:52.440 --> 19:53.601
Come on!

19:57.480 --> 19:59.084
Hi-ya!

20:08.800 --> 20:09.961
Is it off?

20:10.120 --> 20:11.406
Uh, I believe so.

20:11.600 --> 20:12.647
Are you okay?

20:12.800 --> 20:15.280
Your wing looks a little mangled.

20:15.480 --> 20:18.006
My wing is fine. It's A-O-great.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.650
Yeah, that seems bad.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.040
Let's go.

20:22.400 --> 20:24.084
This place is dangerous.

20:28.680 --> 20:30.682
Huh. What is that?

20:33.240 --> 20:34.605
Cool beans.

20:37.320 --> 20:38.560
- What?
- What?

20:38.720 --> 20:39.846
- What's happening?
- Mom, Dad.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.480
The storks are bringing me a baby brother!

20:42.640 --> 20:44.768
That sounds like a nice dream, buddy.

20:44.920 --> 20:47.002
Let's go back to sleep, honey.

20:47.160 --> 20:49.686
This is the best day of my life!

20:49.840 --> 20:51.604
This is the worst day of my life!

20:51.760 --> 20:53.250
Hunter's gonna kill me!

20:53.400 --> 20:55.323
- Why don't we just tell someone?
- Are you insane?

20:55.520 --> 20:57.363
If anyone finds out about this,
I am dead meat.

20:57.560 --> 20:59.210
My hopes of becoming boss destroyed.

21:02.600 --> 21:03.840
No, no, no.

21:04.360 --> 21:06.203
Come on!

21:11.840 --> 21:13.080
What up?

21:13.280 --> 21:14.964
- Hey, Pigeon Toady.
- Hey, there.

21:15.120 --> 21:16.531
Hey, cool metal thing, brah.

21:16.680 --> 21:18.444
New kind of package? What's in it?

21:18.600 --> 21:20.284
- Candy canes.
- Some gas. Uh...

21:22.560 --> 21:24.801
Cool, brah. You catch the game last night?

21:24.960 --> 21:26.724
- Oh, yeah. Real great game.
- Excellent playing.

21:26.880 --> 21:28.484
Yeah, too bad about the last quarter.

21:28.680 --> 21:30.728
- Yeah, that was too bad.
- Real bummer.

21:30.880 --> 21:33.360
And yet then with a little
time left, we pulled it out...

21:33.560 --> 21:34.561
- Totally!
- Yeah.

21:34.720 --> 21:36.609
...only to lose it again
in the last second.

21:36.760 --> 21:38.569
- Such a disappointment.
- It was a comedown.

21:38.720 --> 21:40.449
- Only to get it back.
- Best day of my life!

21:40.600 --> 21:42.011
- Only to lose it!
- Worst day of my life!

21:42.160 --> 21:43.286
Only to get it back.

21:43.440 --> 21:44.487
A roller-coaster of a game!

21:44.640 --> 21:46.642
Only to lose it again.

21:46.800 --> 21:48.245
What a game! Here we go, see you later.

21:48.400 --> 21:49.401
Bye!

21:49.560 --> 21:51.688
Cool. No big deal.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.729
Wait... Wait a second.

21:53.880 --> 21:56.724
There was no game last night.

21:56.880 --> 21:58.245
What the...

22:02.560 --> 22:04.244
Come on. Let's get to my workshop.

22:04.400 --> 22:05.970
We'll be safe there.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.804
All right, okay, all right, all right.

22:11.960 --> 22:13.644
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.

22:13.800 --> 22:16.406
We just need to keep a low-pro here. Okay?

22:16.600 --> 22:18.364
If one person sees a stork with a baby,

22:18.560 --> 22:20.767
my chances of being named boss
are ruined. So...

22:20.920 --> 22:21.921
What are you doing?

22:22.080 --> 22:23.320
- I wanna see the baby!
- No, no, no.

22:23.480 --> 22:24.481
We do not open that thing.

22:24.640 --> 22:26.961
Just a brief exposure
to baby cuteness can ruin your life.

22:27.120 --> 22:28.121
Remember Jasper?

22:29.280 --> 22:31.248
Hmm. I'm trying to put my finger on it.
I can't think of who...

22:31.400 --> 22:33.482
You're being sarcastic because
he changed the course of your life.

22:33.640 --> 22:34.641
- That's right.
- Yeah.

22:34.880 --> 22:37.451
Huh. How about this?

22:39.160 --> 22:42.050
Huh. All right, Storkcon is on Monday.
Today is Friday.

22:42.200 --> 22:45.966
If I can just deliver this thing by then,
I can still be named boss.

22:46.120 --> 22:48.646
Gardner family, here I come!

22:50.160 --> 22:51.924
But your wing's broken. You can't...

22:52.080 --> 22:54.287
Make a plan! Stick to the plan!

22:54.440 --> 22:55.930
Always deliver!

23:05.200 --> 23:08.727
I'll never fly again!

23:09.560 --> 23:10.561
What's that?

23:10.720 --> 23:11.721
Hmm? What's what?

23:11.880 --> 23:13.370
That. Right there.

23:13.720 --> 23:15.290
Uh... Oh, that? No.

23:15.440 --> 23:16.487
That's nothing.

23:16.640 --> 23:17.641
Looks like an airplane.

23:17.800 --> 23:19.802
Well, it kind of is an airplane, I guess.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.240
Great! I'll use it.

23:21.440 --> 23:25.087
Oh, well, it kind of took me a long
time to make, like years and years...

23:25.240 --> 23:26.924
Great. All leading to this moment.

23:27.080 --> 23:28.366
I'm saving it for something else.

23:28.520 --> 23:29.521
- For what?
- Hmm?

23:29.720 --> 23:30.721
What were you gonna use it for?

23:31.720 --> 23:35.645
Uh, it's my dream to deliver packages
for Cornerstore.com.

23:36.040 --> 23:39.169
Oh, well, hey there, kid.

23:39.320 --> 23:42.449
Now's your chance.

23:43.800 --> 23:45.802
- Uh, I don't know.
- Yeah.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.002
I don't even know if it flies.

23:48.280 --> 23:49.327
Eh, uh...

23:55.120 --> 23:56.167
You know what?

23:56.320 --> 23:58.561
Yeah, you can use it.
Let's deliver this baby.

23:58.720 --> 23:59.846
Are you sure though?

24:00.320 --> 24:02.402
- Uh...
- All right, let's do it!

24:03.680 --> 24:05.409
Okay, great.
Let me show you how to fly this.

24:05.560 --> 24:07.164
Um, hello? I'm a bird.

24:07.320 --> 24:08.890
I'm pretty sure I know how to...

24:10.240 --> 24:12.846
I was wrong! I was immediately wrong!

24:17.880 --> 24:20.326
Of course, the autopilot button.
That makes perfect sense.

24:20.680 --> 24:21.806
I knew that. I was testing you.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.564
Oh, you were testing me
on a thing that I made.

24:23.720 --> 24:25.290
- That's correct.
- Is your seat wet?

24:25.480 --> 24:26.481
Yep. That's my urine.

24:26.640 --> 24:28.449
I peed in the seat when we were falling.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.564
Whoo. What else do you want to talk about?

24:30.720 --> 24:32.324
My baby.

24:33.520 --> 24:36.364
Now, I really think you're
gonna love this one, Becky.

24:36.520 --> 24:37.726
I think we found you a good one.

24:37.880 --> 24:41.082
Yeah, when we saw this, we looked
at each other and we were like, "Wow."

24:41.240 --> 24:42.571
"This is theirs." Yeah.

24:42.720 --> 24:44.085
- And it's a fixer-upper...
- Yeah. It is.

24:44.240 --> 24:45.571
...which I know we weren't looking for.

24:45.720 --> 24:48.769
But at least it's not a fixer-downer.

24:50.920 --> 24:51.921
Oh, honey, can you just...

24:52.080 --> 24:53.127
- Can you hold one second?
- Yeah, can you?

24:53.360 --> 24:55.249
- You're up. You're up.
- What? No, it's not my turn.

24:55.400 --> 24:57.721
- You're up, now. You're up.
- It can't be.

24:57.880 --> 24:59.769
So you want a panic room, okay.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.047
Uh...

25:01.240 --> 25:02.366
Nate?

25:03.920 --> 25:04.921
What?

25:05.080 --> 25:06.320
Nate?

25:08.240 --> 25:10.004
Hey there, buddy.

25:10.160 --> 25:11.207
Whatcha doin' here?

25:11.400 --> 25:12.447
I'm preparing.

25:12.600 --> 25:14.011
Right, you're preparing.

25:14.240 --> 25:15.605
For what?

25:15.760 --> 25:17.762
To get my baby brother from the storks.

25:19.920 --> 25:21.126
Right.

25:21.640 --> 25:25.565
Hey, I love your school encourages
imagination over actual learning,

25:25.720 --> 25:28.724
- but the storks don't deliver anymore.
- I know.

25:28.960 --> 25:30.086
They haven't done that in, like, forever.

25:30.240 --> 25:31.605
Dad, you don't have to help me at all.

25:31.800 --> 25:34.610
This is a guilt-free pass for you
to go back inside and work.

25:34.800 --> 25:35.801
Just go.

25:35.960 --> 25:38.361
- Go. Shoo, shoo, Dad. Go.
- What?

25:38.960 --> 25:40.007
Okay, all right. Fine.

25:40.160 --> 25:41.571
You blink and I'll be in college.

25:41.720 --> 25:42.881
What was that?

25:43.040 --> 25:45.691
Hmm? No, I'm just walking, working.

25:45.840 --> 25:47.968
- I didn't say anything. You should just...
- Okay.

25:48.120 --> 25:49.963
Remember when I was a baby?
It felt like one minute ago?

25:50.120 --> 25:52.361
- What?
- What? Hmm?

25:53.040 --> 25:54.041
Fine.

25:54.240 --> 25:55.969
Dad, you'll be my idol
for, like, two more years.

25:56.120 --> 25:57.451
Okay, I heard that one.

25:57.600 --> 25:59.329
Okay. All right, look.

25:59.480 --> 26:02.689
Five minutes. That's all the time I have
is five minutes, and then we stop.

26:02.840 --> 26:03.841
Yeah, five minutes.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.041
Five minutes, and then...

26:05.200 --> 26:06.201
We stop.

26:06.360 --> 26:09.603
Five minutes and then we stop.

26:10.480 --> 26:11.970
What?

26:12.800 --> 26:13.926
Powder?

26:15.200 --> 26:16.645
Baby powder.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.128
Homing pigeon powers activate!

26:30.560 --> 26:32.483
Ah!

26:33.240 --> 26:36.289
Baby, what are we gonna call you, baby?

26:36.840 --> 26:40.003
This is crazy. We are delivering a baby!

26:40.200 --> 26:41.804
No, we are delivering a package.

26:41.960 --> 26:44.327
Maybe we should name it
instead of calling it "the package."

26:44.480 --> 26:46.084
We do not name the package, okay?

26:46.240 --> 26:47.241
It's very simple.

26:47.400 --> 26:49.448
We make a plan. Stick to the plan.

26:49.600 --> 26:51.204
Always deliver.

26:51.360 --> 26:54.443
And then we get back to Storkcon
so the board can name me boss.

26:54.600 --> 26:55.681
Oh, it's so exciting.

26:55.880 --> 26:57.848
What can we expect from boss Junior?

26:58.000 --> 26:59.206
Oh, you know that's top secret.

26:59.360 --> 27:01.124
- You can tell me. Come on.
- It's gonna be big!

27:01.280 --> 27:03.203
Like what? Like, what, how big?
Like, what are you gonna do?

27:03.360 --> 27:05.362
I prefer not to talk about it right now.

27:05.560 --> 27:06.641
- Do you not know?
- What?

27:06.800 --> 27:07.847
- Oh, my gosh. You don't know.
- I know.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.604
If you don't know,
then why do you wanna be boss?

27:09.760 --> 27:10.807
- I know.
- You don't.

27:10.960 --> 27:13.531
Oh, man,
you laugh when you're uncomfortable.

27:13.680 --> 27:14.681
No.

27:14.840 --> 27:16.285
- Am I pushing your buttons?
- Uh, no.

27:16.440 --> 27:17.771
- Yes, I am.
- Nah. No.

27:17.960 --> 27:20.247
- Beep, beep, boop, boop...
- No, those aren't even where my buttons

27:20.440 --> 27:21.771
would be if I had buttons.

27:21.920 --> 27:23.126
- Beep, beep, boop, boop...
- So, nice try.

27:23.280 --> 27:25.647
I am programming you to tell me
why you want to be boss.

27:25.800 --> 27:27.928
I love robots, so this is fun.

27:28.120 --> 27:29.246
We're having a good time together.

27:29.400 --> 27:30.890
Why do you wanna be boss?
Why do you wanna be boss?

27:31.080 --> 27:32.491
Back off!

27:32.720 --> 27:33.721
Oh, God! No!

27:33.920 --> 27:35.251
No, no, no!

27:40.120 --> 27:42.851
Wow! Well, that was funny.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.286
You almost died.

27:44.440 --> 27:49.048
I guess the lesson we learned today is
don't ask me why I want to be boss, right?

27:49.360 --> 27:51.761
Okay, good talk.

27:51.920 --> 27:54.491
Good talk.

27:55.080 --> 27:56.525
That didn't sound happy.

27:56.680 --> 27:59.445
Yeah, well, the package
will be delivered soon enough.

27:59.600 --> 28:00.647
Uh...

28:00.800 --> 28:02.768
I really think that
we should check that out, you know.

28:02.960 --> 28:03.961
Ah, just relax.

28:04.160 --> 28:05.810
Okay. Yeah, you're right.

28:09.480 --> 28:14.327
Ah, you see, the package has
cried itself gently to sleep.

28:26.120 --> 28:27.804
I can't take it!

28:27.960 --> 28:29.962
Can't help body movements! Must open pod!

28:30.120 --> 28:31.246
Wait! No!

28:31.400 --> 28:32.811
The pod! Gotta open the pod!

28:32.960 --> 28:34.883
Oh, no! No, no, no! Come back! Come back!

28:35.040 --> 28:36.610
- Be there in a jiff!
- Pull yourself together!

28:36.840 --> 28:38.205
- Fly this plane!
- Gotta open the pod!

28:38.400 --> 28:40.050
We're gonna die!

28:57.360 --> 28:58.646
Well, at least the baby's quiet.

28:58.840 --> 29:00.001
Are you out of your mind?

29:00.160 --> 29:01.924
A baby cries and you crash a plane?

29:02.080 --> 29:04.003
Hey, hey, hey! I was busy with the pod!

29:04.160 --> 29:07.004
Why didn't you turn on the autopilot?

29:07.160 --> 29:08.605
I was panicking! Listen to me, Tulip.

29:08.760 --> 29:10.922
- You crashed a plane, did you hear me?
- The baby is quiet.

29:11.080 --> 29:12.809
- You crashed a plane!
- The baby is quiet!

29:12.960 --> 29:14.121
- The baby is quiet?
- The baby is quiet!

29:14.280 --> 29:15.930
- Why didn't you say anything?
- Oh, no!

29:16.080 --> 29:17.241
Why is it quiet?

29:17.440 --> 29:20.046
Open the pod! Open the pod!
Open the pod! Open the pod!

29:20.200 --> 29:22.328
How do you open this thing?
How do you open it? Come on!

29:25.560 --> 29:27.244
Aw.

29:30.080 --> 29:31.650
Oh, my gosh.
You know what I just realized?

29:31.800 --> 29:33.450
This baby and I have the same birthday.

29:33.680 --> 29:35.250
Oh, yeah. I don't care.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.283
You crashed the plane.
I don't need you anymore.

29:37.440 --> 29:39.966
I'm going to deliver
the package myself. Goodbye.

29:40.360 --> 29:42.567
What? You're breaking up the team?

29:42.920 --> 29:45.207
"Team"? What is wrong with you?

29:45.360 --> 29:47.283
You and I are not a team. We are nothing.

29:47.440 --> 29:49.010
There is no "we."

29:49.160 --> 29:50.366
This is all your fault. This.

29:50.600 --> 29:52.887
This. This!

29:54.400 --> 29:56.209
All of this.

29:57.320 --> 29:58.970
A good day to you, Orphan Tulip.

29:59.120 --> 30:00.406
A good day.

30:01.200 --> 30:04.170
Well, just so you know, I'll be fine.

30:05.880 --> 30:09.885
I'm the most popular person
in the entire Letter Sorting department.

30:10.040 --> 30:11.690
- I can't hear you!
- I said that...

30:11.920 --> 30:13.410
Yeah, it just sounds
like "Blah, blah, blah,"

30:13.560 --> 30:14.800
but mixed with crying.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.525
But that's not what I'm...
Junior, come here.

30:16.680 --> 30:18.682
I can't hear what you're saying,
but I assume it's lame.

30:19.080 --> 30:20.570
I said I'm the most popular person...

30:20.720 --> 30:22.404
Lame!

30:27.880 --> 30:29.245
Tulip's dumb.

30:29.400 --> 30:31.368
There's a reason she doesn't fit in.

30:31.520 --> 30:34.251
If you're smart enough to build a plane,
then who wrecks one?

30:34.400 --> 30:37.051
I'm gonna deliver this package
and be back at Stork Mountain in no time.

30:47.560 --> 30:50.404
Oh, great. Now I'm surrounded by wolves!

30:50.560 --> 30:53.131
What are you gonna do,
knock me unconscious?

30:53.280 --> 30:54.361
Perfect!

31:06.120 --> 31:07.246
Oh, seriously?

31:07.400 --> 31:09.448
I'm not talking to you. I'm mad at you!

31:09.600 --> 31:11.329
Oh, no. Really? What am I gonna do?

31:11.480 --> 31:12.811
We are done! This conversation is over.

31:12.960 --> 31:13.961
Last word, me!

31:14.120 --> 31:15.121
- Last word.
- Me.

31:15.280 --> 31:16.850
- Last word. Last word.
- Me. Me. Me.

31:29.440 --> 31:30.487
Listen, I'm the alpha.

31:30.640 --> 31:31.641
I'm gonna eat this thing first.

31:31.800 --> 31:33.165
I'm gonna be the new alpha.

31:33.320 --> 31:35.971
No. There is no...
There's no need for a new alpha.

31:36.160 --> 31:37.161
I'm the alpha!

31:37.320 --> 31:38.651
- You...
- You're not even a beta.

31:38.800 --> 31:39.801
I'm the alpha!

31:40.000 --> 31:41.729
No, you're not the alpha!

31:44.960 --> 31:47.122
Aw!

31:48.480 --> 31:49.606
What just happened?

31:49.800 --> 31:53.009
- What was that?
- What did that thing just do?

31:54.200 --> 31:56.248
- I'm sorry. Where were we?
- Oh, yeah.

31:58.680 --> 32:00.125
I'm gonna devour this thing.

32:00.280 --> 32:02.601
I'm gonna bite her arm clean off.

32:08.840 --> 32:10.001
You didn't bite her arm clean off.

32:10.160 --> 32:11.650
This tastes like flowers.

32:11.800 --> 32:13.245
Okay, stand aside.

32:16.800 --> 32:18.370
Look at you. Look what you did.

32:18.520 --> 32:20.443
I did the same thing you did.

32:23.320 --> 32:24.526
- Are you in love?
- I am in love.

32:24.680 --> 32:25.886
- Are you in love?
- I'm in love, too.

32:26.040 --> 32:27.166
I agree. I agree. I agree. I agree.

32:27.320 --> 32:28.731
Hey, guys!

32:28.920 --> 32:31.127
This tiny thing is now a wolf, everybody.

32:31.280 --> 32:32.884
- What did he say?
- What? What's happening?

32:33.040 --> 32:34.166
- Louder. We're in the back!
- We're keeping it!

32:34.320 --> 32:36.448
- Back of the pack, we're keeping it!
- Okay, thank you.

32:36.920 --> 32:37.921
Aw, look at that.

32:38.080 --> 32:39.081
The delivery is now complete.

32:39.240 --> 32:40.287
Now, I just need to find
a way out of here.

32:40.440 --> 32:42.681
Wait, you're not gonna deliver
her to her actual parents?

32:42.840 --> 32:45.241
Baby doesn't know the difference
because babies are dumb.

32:45.440 --> 32:46.566
Oh, babies are not dumb.

32:46.720 --> 32:47.721
They are super dumb.

32:47.880 --> 32:50.565
Babies have a higher level of intelligence
than we will ever understand.

32:50.720 --> 32:52.165
You sound like a baby
that learned how to talk.

32:52.360 --> 32:53.691
I am a baby that learned how to talk!

32:53.840 --> 32:56.002
Hey, I want to teach it
to walk around in circles

32:56.200 --> 32:57.611
- before it lays down.
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

32:57.760 --> 32:58.761
That's my favorite thing to teach.

32:58.920 --> 33:00.081
Don't get too close,
you're gonna scare it!

33:00.240 --> 33:01.241
I'm not... Ow!

33:01.560 --> 33:03.847
Aw!

33:04.080 --> 33:07.880
- Huh. The baby, it's laughing!
- Yeah. Good for it.

33:08.040 --> 33:09.087
No.

33:09.240 --> 33:11.527
Okay, I apologize for what
I'm about to do.

33:13.440 --> 33:14.680
- Ow!
- Sorry.

33:14.920 --> 33:15.921
Aw!

33:16.120 --> 33:17.246
- Stop it!
- Sorry.

33:17.400 --> 33:19.368
Sorry.

33:19.520 --> 33:21.124
- That's my face!
- Sorry!

33:25.240 --> 33:26.810
- Why did you stop?
- Come on!

33:26.960 --> 33:29.008
Okay, I get the plan.
I can fake it. I can fake it!

33:29.160 --> 33:30.650
Okay, okay. Fake it!

33:30.920 --> 33:32.081
Ow!

33:34.760 --> 33:36.000
Wait! Hold on a second, okay? Wait.

33:36.200 --> 33:37.770
All right, I have an idea.

33:37.920 --> 33:41.083
Imagine how much harder
she could hit me if you cut us down.

33:41.240 --> 33:43.527
Oh, yeah! I could really wail on this guy.

33:43.720 --> 33:46.121
I mean, you don't have to
go that hard, but...

33:46.280 --> 33:48.123
- Oh, I think I do.
- Well...

33:48.280 --> 33:49.770
Oh, I'm still mad at you.

33:49.960 --> 33:50.961
Cut 'em down!

33:54.280 --> 33:55.441
Grab a stick or something!

33:55.600 --> 33:56.806
Wait, what?

33:58.800 --> 34:00.245
Aw!

34:00.480 --> 34:02.482
Do you want more?

34:02.800 --> 34:04.086
Yeah!

34:04.240 --> 34:06.971
Will this tiny twig be enough?

34:07.120 --> 34:08.849
- Yes!
- No! No!

34:09.000 --> 34:10.001
Bigger!

34:10.159 --> 34:11.525
Get the biggest twig you can find!

34:11.719 --> 34:14.166
Sorry, Junior.
Gotta give the people what they want.

34:17.360 --> 34:18.929
Grab the baby! Let's go!

34:20.800 --> 34:22.529
Wolfpack, chase!

34:23.239 --> 34:24.571
Chase, chase, chase.

34:24.719 --> 34:25.801
Why wouldn't you stop hitting me?

34:26.000 --> 34:27.081
I was distracting them.

34:27.239 --> 34:28.366
Okay, here we go.

34:32.159 --> 34:33.321
Oh! Oh! We should untie the bridge!

34:33.480 --> 34:35.005
Yeah, I know. What do you think I'm doing?

34:35.880 --> 34:37.484
Chase, chase, chase.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.525
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

34:41.159 --> 34:42.605
Suck it, wolves!

34:43.560 --> 34:47.326
Wolf pack! Form of wolf bridge!

34:48.120 --> 34:49.690
Hut, hut, hut.

35:00.600 --> 35:01.726
What is happening?

35:01.880 --> 35:03.848
The wolves are forming
a suspension bridge.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.445
- How is that possible?
- I don't know.

35:05.600 --> 35:06.886
All right, let's go!

35:08.120 --> 35:09.770
A bridge!

35:10.360 --> 35:11.885
We're probably gonna die!

35:12.040 --> 35:13.201
Chase, chase, chase!

35:20.880 --> 35:21.881
Let's go!

35:22.040 --> 35:23.041
- The door!
- Leave it!

35:23.200 --> 35:25.009
Almost gotcha, almost gotcha,
almost gotcha!

35:28.520 --> 35:30.249
Oh, my gosh!
We can use that thing as a thing!

35:30.440 --> 35:31.885
Right! To thing to the thing!

35:32.040 --> 35:33.610
Let's go!

35:34.160 --> 35:36.049
- You sound like a monkey.
- You sound like a monkey!

35:36.200 --> 35:39.921
Wolf pack, form of wolf boat!

35:41.440 --> 35:42.487
Boat!

35:42.640 --> 35:43.880
Are you kidding me?

35:44.040 --> 35:45.371
That is so unpredictable!

35:45.520 --> 35:46.521
Ha-ha!

36:01.560 --> 36:04.211
Wolf pack! Form of submarine!

36:07.360 --> 36:08.600
Submarine!

36:16.640 --> 36:18.369
I didn't know wolves could
form a submarine!

36:18.520 --> 36:20.409
I've never seen that before
on nature shows.

36:20.560 --> 36:22.244
Okay, quick, get to the plane!

36:22.400 --> 36:23.526
What? I thought it was broken.

36:23.680 --> 36:25.921
No, I fixed it with some spare parts.

36:26.120 --> 36:28.487
We're gonna get ya. We're gonna get ya.

36:34.200 --> 36:35.201
All right, let's go!

36:35.360 --> 36:36.407
Junior!

36:41.600 --> 36:43.204
Obviously, I'm not gonna push it.

36:43.360 --> 36:44.691
Wait!

36:45.200 --> 36:47.009
Oh, I could push it so easily.

36:47.160 --> 36:49.686
It would take
such a little amount of force.

36:52.160 --> 36:53.286
Don't look at me like that.

36:56.640 --> 36:59.405
If you don't give us Tiny Thing,
we're gonna eat you.

36:59.560 --> 37:00.971
We're gonna eat you anyway!

37:01.120 --> 37:02.326
You don't say it.

37:02.480 --> 37:04.562
You make the deal
and then you eat them anyway.

37:04.720 --> 37:05.721
Gotcha!

37:05.880 --> 37:07.006
We're not going to eat you!

37:07.200 --> 37:08.486
Well, now it's too late!

37:08.640 --> 37:10.483
Oh, no! No!

37:10.640 --> 37:12.290
- Junior!
- Let's go!

37:15.080 --> 37:16.161
All right, let's fly!

37:16.320 --> 37:17.321
It doesn't fly.

37:17.480 --> 37:19.130
- What?
- It falls!

37:19.280 --> 37:22.329
Why did I save you?

37:22.520 --> 37:25.171
Whee!

37:33.760 --> 37:36.570
Wolf pack! Form of wolf plane!

37:41.200 --> 37:43.123
- Come on! Come on!
- Let's go!

37:48.400 --> 37:50.482
Tiny Thing, come back!

37:50.640 --> 37:53.530
Oh, come back, Tiny Thing. We need you!

37:55.160 --> 37:56.764
My baby.

38:03.800 --> 38:05.768
Hmm.

38:11.720 --> 38:12.721
What?

38:13.040 --> 38:15.486
Five more minutes and then we stop

38:15.640 --> 38:16.641
What?

38:16.800 --> 38:19.007
- Five more minutes...
- No!

38:20.880 --> 38:21.881
That's our chimney!

38:22.040 --> 38:23.451
You're gonna destroy the whole roof?

38:23.600 --> 38:25.728
Mom, we have to replace
the chimney with a slide

38:25.880 --> 38:27.882
for when the storks deliver
my baby brother.

38:28.040 --> 38:29.041
What he said.

38:29.240 --> 38:31.561
No! Don't be crazy.
You cannot do the chimney.

38:31.720 --> 38:33.404
Come on, don't make me the mean mom.

38:33.560 --> 38:35.562
- Dads are fun, moms are mean.
- I heard that!

38:35.720 --> 38:37.404
- Parent conference.
- Pinching!

38:37.560 --> 38:39.722
Henry, people are gonna think we're crazy.

38:39.920 --> 38:41.001
We need to tell him.

38:41.160 --> 38:42.161
Tell him what?

38:42.320 --> 38:43.685
What, to go watch more TV?

38:43.880 --> 38:46.565
This is the best time I've had
with Nate in my life.

38:46.760 --> 38:48.091
I actually feel like a dad again.

38:48.240 --> 38:50.368
And when no baby brother shows up?

38:50.520 --> 38:52.602
Well, then we tell him.

38:52.760 --> 38:53.761
We can get a new chimney,

38:53.920 --> 38:55.922
but we'll never be able to
replace this time with Nate.

38:56.080 --> 38:57.809
And if we put those headsets back on,

38:57.960 --> 39:00.247
how old will Nate be
when we take them off again?

39:00.440 --> 39:01.680
I'm not a jerky teen yet.

39:01.840 --> 39:04.207
Fleeting moments, precious memories.

39:16.640 --> 39:18.290
Moms are fun, too.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.606
Wow! That's...
That's not a well-made chimney.

39:24.760 --> 39:26.444
I'm... I'm a small woman
and that just came...

39:26.600 --> 39:28.045
Yeah, that came right down!

39:33.400 --> 39:35.482
Okay, so, uh, what's next?

39:35.680 --> 39:37.125
Okay, it's Saturday night.

39:37.280 --> 39:40.602
As long as we deliver by tomorrow,
we can still make it for Storkcon Monday.

39:41.920 --> 39:43.922
Thanks for waiting for me back there.

39:44.600 --> 39:46.011
I don't know what you're talking about.

39:46.160 --> 39:48.845
Oh, okay, "I'm too manly to
admit anything at all about anything."

39:49.000 --> 39:50.001
Is that supposed to be me?

39:50.200 --> 39:53.568
Oh, sorry, "This is a more
accurate representation."

39:53.720 --> 39:56.326
Oh, you're so right.
That is what I sound like.

39:56.480 --> 39:58.289
Let's both talk like this.

40:01.280 --> 40:03.044
Baby's fussing.

40:03.200 --> 40:05.168
She's bored. We have to distract her.

40:05.320 --> 40:06.481
Oh, let's see. Oh!

40:06.640 --> 40:09.041
You are a baby, you are a baby

40:09.200 --> 40:10.201
Little hands, little feet

40:10.360 --> 40:11.964
- Look at you, you're so sweet
- JUNIOR: Stop! Stop! Stop!

40:12.120 --> 40:13.167
You're so cute I wanna...

40:13.320 --> 40:14.446
Let's just step aside, all right?

40:14.640 --> 40:16.290
- And let me do it.
- You want to sing to her?

40:16.440 --> 40:17.680
Yeah. Is that so surprising?

40:17.840 --> 40:19.365
I'm a pretty good singer, actually.

40:19.560 --> 40:20.925
Okay, fine! Sing to her.

40:22.800 --> 40:24.404
When you need a little something

40:24.560 --> 40:25.721
And there's too much to do

40:25.880 --> 40:28.451
Just click your little finger
And we'll ship it for you

40:28.680 --> 40:31.843
Cornerstore, Cornerstore.com

40:32.480 --> 40:33.845
Free shipping does not apply
in Alaska and Hawaii.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.684
Wait, wait, wait, is that a song?

40:35.840 --> 40:37.126
That's not a song, that's an ad.

40:37.280 --> 40:39.408
- Well, strap in for this one then, Tulip.
- Okay.

40:39.640 --> 40:41.165
Cornerstore

40:41.320 --> 40:42.367
I like how this is going.

40:42.520 --> 40:45.046
Let your packages rain down on me

40:57.720 --> 41:00.769
Uh, this looks like a good place
to rest for the night.

41:00.920 --> 41:02.251
Junior, what are talking about?
Why are you acting...

41:02.400 --> 41:03.401
I can't hear what you're saying.

41:03.600 --> 41:05.602
- Junior?
- I can't hear you!

41:06.560 --> 41:07.641
Junior!

41:18.520 --> 41:20.204
Hmm...

41:22.560 --> 41:25.564
Hey! Have you seen
a red-headed lady and a stork?

41:25.720 --> 41:26.767
A bird and a lady?

41:26.960 --> 41:28.371
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

41:28.520 --> 41:31.729
I saw two that fit that
description the other day!

41:33.320 --> 41:34.924
No, man, I will not be your friend.

41:35.240 --> 41:37.368
Sorry, thought we were vibing.

41:53.480 --> 41:55.209
Why you being so creepy?

42:04.400 --> 42:06.767
You know what? Just get... Here. Here.

42:11.280 --> 42:13.089
I'm just gonna put this right here.

42:18.800 --> 42:19.801
Uh...

42:20.320 --> 42:21.810
What happened back there?

42:21.960 --> 42:23.325
What? What do you mean?

42:23.480 --> 42:25.847
Uh, you stabbed the raft?
For literally no reason!

42:26.000 --> 42:28.321
It was not for no reason.
It was for personal reasons.

42:28.520 --> 42:30.682
Anyways, there's a port
right there on the coast.

42:30.840 --> 42:33.805
We'll just leave first thing in the
morning and deliver the package.

42:35.560 --> 42:36.766
Just call it "the baby."

42:36.920 --> 42:38.490
Why are you so afraid of babies?

42:38.640 --> 42:42.241
Because this one single package could ruin
everything I've worked towards my entire life!

42:42.400 --> 42:44.402
- Why do you wanna be boss again?
- Not this again.

42:44.560 --> 42:46.642
No, really.
Why do you wanna be boss of Cornerstore?

42:46.800 --> 42:49.485
I don't know, okay? I mean...

42:49.640 --> 42:51.085
Why does anyone want to be boss?

42:51.240 --> 42:52.241
It rules. That's why.

42:52.400 --> 42:54.323
Yeah, but what would you do?

42:54.600 --> 42:57.331
- I don't know. What would you do?
- I'm glad you asked!

42:57.480 --> 43:00.450
Well, for one, I would employ a more
diverse variety of birds and animals.

43:00.640 --> 43:02.642
Two, I would get rid of
the Cornerstore warehouse

43:02.800 --> 43:04.325
because that building is a bummer.

43:04.480 --> 43:07.563
And three, I would start
delivering babies again.

43:09.480 --> 43:11.289
Okay, you were very prepared
for that question.

43:11.480 --> 43:12.481
Man, I feel so close to you.

43:12.640 --> 43:13.641
Like we're girlfriends already.

43:13.800 --> 43:16.525
All right, I knew as I was saying it
that I should just keep my mouth shut.

43:16.680 --> 43:19.490
Aw, I want to braid
your feathers immediately!

43:27.920 --> 43:29.649
Look, uh...

43:30.000 --> 43:31.081
Yeah?

43:31.920 --> 43:35.527
While we're being real honest right now,
I'll tell you why I built my plane.

43:35.680 --> 43:38.604
It's not to deliver packages
for Cornerstore.com.

43:39.400 --> 43:41.846
I built my plane to find my parents.

43:45.400 --> 43:48.563
But I thought you didn't know
where your parents lived.

43:49.160 --> 43:53.529
When Jasper destroyed my
homing beacon, I lost all the pieces.

43:53.680 --> 43:55.045
Except one.

43:56.840 --> 44:01.402
And I thought this, plus some luck
might be enough to find my parents.

44:01.560 --> 44:04.882
So, you sacrificed your plane
for this baby?

44:05.040 --> 44:06.724
- Yeah.
- Why?

44:06.880 --> 44:10.885
Oh, I don't know.
I guess if this baby finds her family,

44:11.080 --> 44:12.809
I mean, it's worth it.

44:13.400 --> 44:14.526
Right?

44:16.080 --> 44:18.082
Fine. You can name her.

44:18.360 --> 44:19.771
- Really?
- Yeah, go ahead.

44:19.920 --> 44:21.046
Diamond Destiny.

44:21.200 --> 44:22.406
Okay, I changed my mind.
You can't name her.

44:22.560 --> 44:24.005
Too late! Her name is Diamond Destiny.
Yes, it is!

44:24.160 --> 44:25.650
I thought it was gonna be,
like, an actual name.

44:25.800 --> 44:27.325
It is a name. Diamond Destiny is her name!

44:27.480 --> 44:29.403
Isn't that right, Diamond Destiny?

44:29.600 --> 44:34.242
We're gonna find your parents,
and everything is gonna be just perfect.

44:36.800 --> 44:38.165
You'll find your family.

44:38.360 --> 44:39.646
You think?

44:39.800 --> 44:41.040
For sure.

44:41.240 --> 44:42.571
Good night.

44:43.520 --> 44:44.760
Good night!

44:49.080 --> 44:50.923
Huh!

44:51.280 --> 44:52.566
What is it? I'm up.

44:53.120 --> 44:54.610
Do you think she's hungry?

44:54.760 --> 44:56.046
Yeah. I don't know.

44:56.200 --> 44:58.248
Uh, maybe she just needs to be rocked.

44:58.920 --> 44:59.921
Okay.

45:05.240 --> 45:06.401
Oh, my gosh.

45:06.680 --> 45:08.011
Her eyes could not be more open.

45:08.160 --> 45:09.685
Okay, grab that end.

45:13.800 --> 45:15.245
It's like we're a family.

45:15.440 --> 45:16.521
We are not like a family.

45:16.680 --> 45:19.843
We're just a guy and a girl
trying to put our baby to sleep.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.570
Let's just put her to sleep.

45:21.840 --> 45:23.330
Come on, close, close, close.

45:23.480 --> 45:25.323
Okay, close. Close, close, close.

45:25.480 --> 45:27.323
That's good, right? Is that closed enough?

45:27.480 --> 45:29.005
No! Look, I can still see eyeball.

45:29.480 --> 45:31.608
Can we manually close them? Here.

45:31.760 --> 45:33.649
No! Don't do that! What are you doing?

45:33.800 --> 45:35.643
I'm gonna... Wait!
Okay, give me the eye glue.

45:35.800 --> 45:37.484
- What?
- You know, for gluing eyes shut.

45:37.640 --> 45:39.210
No, we don't have any.

45:39.480 --> 45:40.527
It's gonna stick.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.162
What if she never goes to sleep?

45:44.320 --> 45:45.481
All right, you know what? I got her.

45:45.680 --> 45:47.250
You just go to bed.
You go to bed. It's fine.

45:47.400 --> 45:50.165
No, I don't wanna go to bed
if you're gonna be up. I'll feel bad.

45:50.320 --> 45:52.845
I know. But if I go to bed, then
I'm gonna feel guilty. And I just can't.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.161
No, that's what I'm saying. Listen to me.

45:54.360 --> 45:56.761
No, so that's why you go to bed,
and I'll take care of her.

45:58.560 --> 46:00.244
All right. I'll go to bed.

46:00.840 --> 46:02.126
I can't believe you went to bed!

46:02.320 --> 46:04.004
What? You just said it was
okay for me to go bed!

46:04.160 --> 46:05.161
Okay, you know what?

46:05.360 --> 46:06.850
Can we just rock her in our arms?

46:07.000 --> 46:08.843
No. We do not. No loving the baby.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.206
You said "baby."

46:10.360 --> 46:11.771
Fine. I don't care. I don't care.

46:12.320 --> 46:13.367
You love it.

46:14.360 --> 46:17.489
Goodbye, brah!

46:17.920 --> 46:20.491
How you like me now? Huh!

46:21.200 --> 46:23.202
"How you like me now"?

46:24.040 --> 46:26.202
How you like me now?

46:26.520 --> 46:28.807
How do you like me now!

46:28.960 --> 46:31.088
Now there was a time

46:33.200 --> 46:35.123
When you loved me so

46:37.680 --> 46:40.081
I could do no wrong

46:41.720 --> 46:43.722
And now you need to know

46:43.880 --> 46:44.927
Dance break!

46:51.680 --> 46:55.605
How you like me now? How you like me now?

46:55.760 --> 46:58.127
And you're sure you saw this?

46:58.280 --> 47:00.760
Yes, I'm sure I saw this.

47:00.960 --> 47:02.849
All right. Let's keep this quiet.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.286
Yes, sir.

47:04.440 --> 47:06.329
Thank you for your loyalty, Pigeon Toady.

47:06.480 --> 47:09.927
Or should I say boss.

47:20.640 --> 47:22.165
Cool, cool, cool.

47:25.920 --> 47:28.969
Whoa! Steam room in an elevator.
Mind blown!

47:29.120 --> 47:30.121
Shut up! I'm planning.

47:30.320 --> 47:31.321
Oh, that's cool.

47:31.480 --> 47:32.606
All right. Now, listen.

47:32.760 --> 47:34.285
First, we have to stop that delivery.

47:34.560 --> 47:36.881
But we don't know where they're headed.

47:37.080 --> 47:39.481
Indeed. We won't go to them.

47:39.640 --> 47:40.766
We'll make them...

47:40.960 --> 47:42.041
Come to us.

47:42.200 --> 47:43.884
Yes!

47:44.320 --> 47:45.924
Well, I'm off.

47:46.080 --> 47:47.923
You're in a suit suddenly.

47:48.080 --> 47:49.206
Let's go.

47:53.200 --> 47:55.089
My towel blew away.

47:57.440 --> 47:58.646
Junior.

47:58.800 --> 48:00.006
Wake up. We gotta go.

48:00.160 --> 48:01.207
I'm still asleep.

48:01.360 --> 48:02.486
I know, we gotta go, we gotta go.

48:02.640 --> 48:04.005
Just let me sleep a little longer.

48:04.160 --> 48:06.561
Junior. Baby's awake.
Ship's leaving. Let's go!

48:06.720 --> 48:08.848
You do it. You get the baby.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.650
Junior, I'm tired, too!

48:10.800 --> 48:13.007
You made it, you get it.

48:15.280 --> 48:16.281
Hey!

49:52.560 --> 49:54.085
Ooh!

50:23.080 --> 50:24.320
Yes!

50:25.280 --> 50:26.770
Diamond Destiny,
you come back here right now.

50:26.960 --> 50:27.961
I'm not fooling around.

50:28.120 --> 50:29.451
All right, let's go.
We got a boat to catch.

50:29.600 --> 50:31.125
We got a boat to catch, oh!

50:31.280 --> 50:32.281
Here we go. On it.

50:32.440 --> 50:33.566
Home stretch!

50:50.240 --> 50:52.163
We have to be absolutely silent.

50:52.360 --> 50:55.011
One human sees a stork with
a baby and we'll get reported.

50:55.160 --> 50:57.367
All right, last one. Let's pack it up.

51:04.480 --> 51:05.561
What was that?

51:05.720 --> 51:06.801
Sounds like a baby.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.651
That's very suspicious.

51:10.120 --> 51:12.009
- Why is she doing that?
- I don't know.

51:12.160 --> 51:13.650
Diaper?

51:14.000 --> 51:15.001
Check.

51:15.160 --> 51:16.161
Food?

51:16.800 --> 51:17.801
Check.

51:17.960 --> 51:18.961
Maybe she needs a nap.

51:19.120 --> 51:20.485
Rock-a-bye baby, on the treetop

51:20.680 --> 51:22.603
Nope. What is it? What does she want?

51:22.760 --> 51:23.761
It's coming from over there!

51:29.040 --> 51:30.166
I don't know. She's reaching for you.

51:30.320 --> 51:31.321
Maybe she just wants you.

51:31.520 --> 51:32.931
No. That doesn't make sense.

51:35.240 --> 51:36.890
Technically, she should be
perfectly happy.

51:37.040 --> 51:38.644
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

51:38.880 --> 51:40.291
I have no idea.

51:43.520 --> 51:44.521
Oh, no!

51:44.920 --> 51:45.921
Oh, no.

51:46.120 --> 51:47.849
She's gonna blow! She's gonna blow!

51:48.040 --> 51:49.041
What do I do with her?

51:49.200 --> 51:50.281
Take her, take her. Just take her!

52:06.200 --> 52:07.884
- Ah, look at that.
- Hmm.

52:08.040 --> 52:09.690
Actually seems to be working pretty well.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.207
Ha! She smells so nice!

52:15.400 --> 52:18.563
Who's got the little sparkly eyes? You do.

52:19.040 --> 52:20.246
You do.

52:26.480 --> 52:28.448
Oh, no! The boat's leaving!

52:31.360 --> 52:33.203
No, no, no! Come on!

52:34.280 --> 52:36.931
Wolf pack. Form of wolf minivan!

52:38.920 --> 52:40.160
Minivan!

52:41.560 --> 52:43.164
Ow, ow, ow...

52:44.240 --> 52:45.241
Give me a break!

52:45.400 --> 52:46.401
- Click, click.
- Click.

52:48.080 --> 52:49.161
My baby!

52:49.320 --> 52:50.560
Ah! We got the Tiny Thing!

52:50.720 --> 52:52.484
This is not a safe way
to transport the baby.

52:52.640 --> 52:54.927
- We're parents now.
- Just go slower.

52:55.080 --> 52:58.323
- You're right, you're right, you're right.
- Slower.

52:59.840 --> 53:00.887
Okay, good.

53:01.560 --> 53:03.130
Is that good, Tiny Thing?

53:03.600 --> 53:05.011
Hmm? Tiny Thing?

53:05.240 --> 53:06.810
We lost her again!

53:07.800 --> 53:10.326
Quick! We can get to
the boat through here.

53:11.400 --> 53:12.686
Ah!

53:13.640 --> 53:16.211
Wait. Why are you running so weird?

53:16.360 --> 53:18.203
What don't I know?

53:19.000 --> 53:20.604
My old nemesis.

53:20.960 --> 53:22.610
"Glass."

53:27.640 --> 53:30.484
Birds can't see glass!

53:33.280 --> 53:34.441
Give us Tiny Thing.

53:34.600 --> 53:36.728
Just go, Tulip. It's too late for me.

53:36.880 --> 53:38.769
You've got the baby.
You can deliver her yourself.

53:38.920 --> 53:40.968
What? No, I'm not leaving you behind!

53:41.120 --> 53:42.963
We can do this. Together!

53:43.120 --> 53:45.009
Where's the Tiny Thing?

53:45.200 --> 53:47.487
- All right. Tulip, you got this!
- Tiny Thing! Tiny Thing!

53:47.640 --> 53:49.688
- Okay, left. Right. Straight.
- Where's the Tiny Thing?

53:49.840 --> 53:51.888
Straight! Left! Right!

53:53.160 --> 53:55.083
Oh, no! I'm panicking!

53:55.240 --> 53:57.447
Uh, right again! Left, I mean. Left!

53:57.600 --> 53:58.931
Right! Right, I mean.

53:59.200 --> 54:00.964
Left! Left! Right! Right!

54:01.120 --> 54:02.645
Left! Left! Left! Right!

54:02.880 --> 54:04.166
Rolft! I mean, ralft!

54:05.760 --> 54:08.411
Right! Left! I'm just shouting words!

54:08.560 --> 54:10.244
This is not working!

54:12.200 --> 54:14.123
Oh-oh! We did that together!

54:14.280 --> 54:15.725
I ran into every piece of glass.

54:15.880 --> 54:17.166
Some, more than once.

54:19.280 --> 54:20.441
Oh, jeez.

54:21.800 --> 54:23.211
Ah!

54:24.520 --> 54:25.521
What are the chances of that?

54:25.680 --> 54:27.205
I guess, pretty high in a glass factory.

54:27.360 --> 54:29.408
- Tiny Thing! Tiny Thing!
- Come on!

54:33.520 --> 54:35.409
First, we're gonna take Tiny Thing

54:35.560 --> 54:38.040
and raise her to be a strong,
independent woman.

54:38.200 --> 54:40.771
And then, we're gonna eat you.

54:41.520 --> 54:42.931
We made a great team.

54:43.080 --> 54:45.890
My baby.

54:46.320 --> 54:48.322
That's my baby!

54:49.360 --> 54:51.010
It's Jasper!

54:51.160 --> 54:52.207
My baby!

54:56.400 --> 54:58.209
- No, no, no!
- My baby! My baby! My baby!

54:58.360 --> 54:59.407
Let go!

54:59.560 --> 55:01.244
Let go of us!

55:02.480 --> 55:04.403
Wolf pack, form of...

55:05.600 --> 55:07.045
Broken heart!

55:07.240 --> 55:09.481
Cry! Cry!

55:09.760 --> 55:10.841
Get away from us!

55:11.000 --> 55:12.047
- Get away!
- Stay back!

55:12.240 --> 55:13.241
- Go home!
- Come on!

55:13.400 --> 55:14.401
Don't make me hit you!

55:14.560 --> 55:17.370
- Hey, hey, hey! Let me explain!
- I don't wanna hear it!

55:17.520 --> 55:18.851
When you orphaned me, you said "whoops!"

55:19.040 --> 55:20.644
Whoops! You said "whoops!" Who does that?

55:20.800 --> 55:22.404
Will you please let me explain?

55:22.560 --> 55:24.722
Hey! She doesn't wanna hear
your explanation, guy!

55:24.920 --> 55:25.967
Back off!

55:26.120 --> 55:28.122
I fell in love with you.

55:29.480 --> 55:30.481
Okay, fine.

55:30.680 --> 55:32.409
Honestly, I am very curious.
Let's hear it.

55:34.080 --> 55:37.687
Look, they tell you being
a stork isn't gonna be easy.

55:37.840 --> 55:38.966
Always deliver.

55:39.520 --> 55:41.090
I failed to do that.

55:41.240 --> 55:44.164
Your beacon broke. The pieces scattered.

55:44.440 --> 55:45.885
I spent my entire life

55:46.040 --> 55:50.682
searching for the missing pieces
so that I could deliver my baby.

55:51.080 --> 55:54.527
And yet, after all these years,
I'm still missing one piece.

55:55.840 --> 55:57.569
- But, I have pledged...
- Oh, my gosh! Wait.

55:57.720 --> 55:59.484
...to be the parent
I took from you, Tulip.

55:59.640 --> 56:01.369
And I will lay down my life.

56:01.520 --> 56:03.204
I have the missing piece!

56:04.520 --> 56:05.885
Excuse me, what?

56:06.040 --> 56:08.122
I have the missing piece.

56:16.960 --> 56:18.450
My home!

56:19.040 --> 56:20.280
I'm going home!

56:20.880 --> 56:25.488
I'm gonna finally meet my real family.

56:25.800 --> 56:27.131
Oh, my gosh!

56:27.320 --> 56:29.163
This is crazy! Junior, can you believe it?

56:29.360 --> 56:30.885
No, that's so... That's so great.

56:31.200 --> 56:32.645
Yeah, yeah, you should go.

56:33.320 --> 56:36.210
Oh, yeah, well, after we deliver the baby.
But, yeah!

56:36.440 --> 56:38.363
No, no, no. I can take care of the baby.

56:38.520 --> 56:39.646
You should go now.

56:40.200 --> 56:41.725
No, no, no.
We have to finish the delivery.

56:41.880 --> 56:42.961
I'm sorry to cut you off.

56:43.120 --> 56:46.090
You know what's so funny is
just then when you said "real family",

56:46.240 --> 56:47.605
it, like, weirdly hurt my feelings.

56:47.800 --> 56:49.962
But I realized how stupid that is.

56:50.240 --> 56:52.368
I mean, I'm a bird
and you're, like, a sloppy human

56:52.520 --> 56:55.046
and that's not our baby.
It's just some baby.

56:55.200 --> 56:58.283
Well, I mean, we're not, like, a "family",
but we are like a family.

56:58.440 --> 57:02.001
Well, it's like we are
except instead we're more like employees

57:02.160 --> 57:03.685
who are delivering a package,
and that's all.

57:03.840 --> 57:05.171
Do you know what I mean?

57:05.320 --> 57:06.481
And you should go to where you belong.

57:06.640 --> 57:07.846
Now. Do you know what I mean?

57:08.000 --> 57:09.729
No! Junior, we are a team, okay?

57:09.880 --> 57:12.161
We're gonna deliver this baby,
then we're gonna meet my parents,

57:12.360 --> 57:15.682
- then I'm gonna show them Stork Mountain.
- I was supposed to fire you.

57:15.840 --> 57:16.921
Okay?

57:17.520 --> 57:19.682
You were supposed to fire me?

57:19.840 --> 57:21.205
Yeah.

57:21.360 --> 57:24.045
Well, "liberate". "Free". Yes, fire.

57:24.200 --> 57:25.690
And then I didn't,
and then this all happened.

57:25.840 --> 57:28.161
Look, there's nothing waiting for you
back at Stork Mountain.

57:33.240 --> 57:34.366
Who cares though?

57:34.520 --> 57:36.204
It's time for you to go
and meet your real family!

57:36.360 --> 57:38.283
That's exciting, right?

57:39.400 --> 57:40.401
Look, I...

57:40.600 --> 57:43.046
I just think this is
for the best, you know?

57:45.360 --> 57:47.249
It's what you've always wanted.

57:47.440 --> 57:48.601
Yeah, I wanna go meet my family.

57:48.760 --> 57:51.525
So, yeah, I better go now, I guess.

57:51.840 --> 57:53.922
It's gonna be fine.
I'll take good care of her.

57:54.120 --> 57:56.407
Okay, okay. Fine.

57:58.440 --> 57:59.726
Goodbye, little girl.

57:59.880 --> 58:01.882
Have a good trip back home.

58:02.720 --> 58:05.451
You take care...

58:05.600 --> 58:07.887
And be safe.

58:32.400 --> 58:34.448
I'm scared.

58:34.600 --> 58:37.649
They're your family.
They're going to love you.

58:41.920 --> 58:43.729
I'll be right here.

58:43.920 --> 58:45.445
Oh, oh! Give me your camera.

58:45.600 --> 58:47.967
I'd love to capture this family moment.

58:49.560 --> 58:52.564
Okay, camera rolling and action.

59:02.680 --> 59:04.682
Yup. Okay.

59:06.280 --> 59:07.486
Ring the doorbell.

59:09.960 --> 59:11.962
I don't hear a doorbell ringing.

59:16.680 --> 59:18.569
You're right. Let's take our time.

59:18.720 --> 59:20.961
I've only waited my whole life for this!

59:23.280 --> 59:24.281
Tulip?

59:31.120 --> 59:33.009
Hmm?

59:40.160 --> 59:41.525
The storks!

59:46.400 --> 59:47.401
Oh, boy!

59:47.600 --> 59:49.125
- Here we go!
- Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

59:49.280 --> 59:50.611
- Okay. Big smile!
- I'm a little nervous. Okay.

59:50.760 --> 59:52.205
Everyone, calm down!

59:57.280 --> 59:58.805
This is not to code.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.570
- What?
- This all has to come down.

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:04.321
Hunter?

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.323
- You're fired!
- But, but, but...

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:08.164
"But, but, but..." You are so idiotic!

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:09.560
How were you not suspicious?

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:13.690
I thought it was
a gentrifying neighborhood.

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:15.882
Didn't expect to see you here, brah!

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:17.724
Oh, yes, I did. I set it up.

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:19.121
Seize the thing!

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:24.764
Wait, no! Not the baby!

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:28.443
Don't worry. She's gonna be fine.

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:29.721
She's with penguins.

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:32.451
They have whole documentaries
about how great they are at babysitting.

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:36.961
And she'll be an excellent swimmer.

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:39.885
And then when she's old enough,
we'll return her to the human world.

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:42.407
That's insane! You need to deliver her!

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:45.848
We can't let it get out that the new
boss accidentally made a baby!

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.968
Our stock would plummet,
everything we've built.

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:50.401
My entire company will fall apart!

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.244
Those parents can never find out.

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.129
Okay, we're ready to go.

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:57.722
Who's the baby now?

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:00.206
Good enough.

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:10.129
- "Cease and desist"?
- Why?

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:12.931
This is not up to code,
and quite frankly, it looks dangerous.

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:14.081
We can't tear it down.

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:16.288
'Cause then the storks won't
deliver my baby brother.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.648
The policeman's right, Nate.

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:31.804
They don't deliver babies. Not anymore.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.764
Then why did we do all this stuff?

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:37.442
Because we were having
such fun playing with you.

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:40.524
Oh, honey. We spent time together.

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:42.444
And that's what matters.

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:45.967
So is this like
a ticket thing or a warning thing?

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:47.321
It feels like a warning, right?

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:49.289
Yeah, we are warned.
We are properly warned.

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:27.084
Oh, buddy.

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:31.886
Come on.

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:38.446
What?

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:45.521
Oh, my gosh! Are you okay?

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:46.841
What happened? Where's the baby?

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.331
They tied me up and took her.

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:49.686
Why would you think this was her house?

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:51.490
It's surrounded by
a bunch of scary warehouses!

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:52.641
Gentrification!

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:54.689
How could they just take her?
She was your responsibility!

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:55.841
It wasn't my fault, okay?

01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:57.769
I'm not blaming you.
I'm just worried about the baby!

01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:59.928
Well, I'm also worried,
which is why I'm yelling!

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:01.684
We're yelling 'cause we're wasting time!

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:03.649
How can we get back to Cornerstore?

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:06.804
You're shopping? What are you doing?

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:12.126
Oh, I see.
You did that so we could hide in the box

01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:13.406
and get back to Cornerstore real quick.

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:14.726
- That's right.
- Yeah.

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:17.600
Wait a minute. Junior, what is going on?

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:21.526
What the heck is this?

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:23.330
This is Storkcon.

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:26.404
Once a year, storks come
together for one thing.

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:27.561
Storkcon!

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:31.520
The biggest stork convention
on the planet Earth, where birds and...

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:32.886
- Uh, Junior?
- What?

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:34.690
What are you doing?
We have to save the baby.

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:36.683
I'm just a huge fan of Storkcon.

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:38.080
'Cause it's so cool.

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:39.607
There. Look, look, look!

01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:41.728
They're headed towards the flight deck.

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:45.565
What? It calms me.

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:49.770
Presenting the world's first round box

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:51.251
Sphericus!

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:55.969
Circles can hold dreams!

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.684
How are we gonna get through this crowd?

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:01.171
Hello.

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:03.848
I'm full of dreams!

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:06.927
Hey, you guys aren't
supposed to be back here.

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:10.529
Pardon me, big guy.

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:11.927
I'm full of dreams!

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:13.081
Listen to me, Tulip.

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.931
Even if we get the baby,
we have no way to get out of here.

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:17.326
Storkcon is huge

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.170
for storks come from
all across the world...

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:20.446
Junior, stop talking about Storkcon!

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:21.681
All right, I'm sorry.

01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:23.205
It's just really impressive. Here we go.

01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:58.602
Put down that baby!

01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:22.765
Whoo!

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:23.171
Growth analytics suggest
increased bandwidth

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:25.971
enabling us to silo
creative core components.

01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:27.121
I got your text.

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:28.725
Sorry, but we could only find
one jet pack.

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:30.206
All right, give me the pack.
I'm taking her.

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:31.725
- What? No, I'm taking her.
- No way.

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:32.921
When you had her last, you lost her.

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:35.082
- After you left us.
- After you fired me!

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:36.526
'Cause you're bad at everything.

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:37.721
- I wish I'd never met you.
- Whoa! Wow,

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:39.086
well, you know what?
I wish I'd never met you.

01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:42.001
The only good thing to come out of all
of this is this baby, and I am taking her.

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:44.731
This baby is far too precious
and perfect for you. I'm taking her!

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:45.927
- I'm taking her.
- I'm taking her!

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:47.923
- I'm taking her!
- I'm taking her!

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:53.043
What is that?

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:58.651
My pants fell down. Oh, no!

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:12.162
- Where are we going?
- I don't know!

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:15.051
Oh, okay. Not that way.

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:16.201
Not that way either.

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:17.441
Hey, guys.

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:19.929
This is very overwhelming.

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:23.011
Hand over that thing!

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:27.966
Come one step closer,

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:31.324
and I will drop this.

01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:33.085
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:38.323
Junior, look, hand over the baby,
and we'll let bygones be bygones.

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:39.527
More than that.

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:41.728
You can still be...

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:50.081
Why isn't it working?

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:54.041
One baby?

01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:56.924
How about a million!

01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:58.127
Wait, no!

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:02.686
Danger. Danger.

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:05.286
I did not think that through.

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:11.210
No!

01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:25.401
- Turn it off! Turn it off!
- Aw!

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:27.763
You stop it this instant!

01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:48.723
Shut it down! Shut it down!

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:51.689
This is my moment!

01:09:58.240 --> 01:09:59.446
Whoa!

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.246
Ooh!

01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:04.127
Oh, no!

01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:14.321
Uh...

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:15.806
Uh-oh.

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:24.803
- Let's go!
- Come on!

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:26.962
Go, go, go! Grab it!

01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:41.120
- Over here. I got this one.
- Catch it!

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:43.089
Got it! Whoo!

01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:44.651
Out of my way! Out of my way!

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:48.970
Oh, no!

01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:56.489
One million babies!

01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:03.761
Oh, hi.

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:04.967
- Oh, no!
- No!

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:06.167
Come on!

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:10.567
Now it's time to do what
I should've done so long ago.

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:13.406
Destroy the Baby Factory!

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:14.607
No, you can't.

01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:15.841
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't!

01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:17.530
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't!

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:19.849
We could go on like this all day.
I'm just gonna go on

01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:21.724
and destroy the Baby Factory.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.207
Goodbye, baby-making machine.

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:30.491
What the heck?

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:32.611
Told you babies were smart.

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:38.046
Babies are dumb.
Babies are super-duper dumb.

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:39.201
- No, no, no.
- No, no. Wait, no.

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:41.647
- Diamond, give it back!
- You stop it, this instant! Stop! Stop!

01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:44.921
Come on!

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:46.167
What?

01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:48.601
No!

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:20.086
Whoa!

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:27.841
Now get over here and get me out of here.

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:30.081
Oh!

01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:32.442
All right. Don't move.

01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:41.288
Whoa!

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:43.686
What?

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:48.801
Oh, no.

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:03.481
No!

01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:51.602
Always deliver!

01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:55.441
Whoo! You did it!

01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:57.125
I can hear my bones.

01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:01.447
Yeah, we should land
because this hurts so much.

01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:04.211
We did it! We did it! We're a family!

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:06.283
Yes! We're a...

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:12.564
Sorry, I kinda ruined the moment there.

01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:14.569
I just have so much internal bleeding.

01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:16.330
We're a family!

01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:17.681
Look at that.

01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:20.201
Uh, what? What? I thought it was broken.

01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:21.566
I guess it was just dislocated.

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:23.245
It must've popped back in when we landed.

01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:26.085
Oh, yep. What a twist.

01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:42.481
- Oh, no.
- Uh...

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:45.120
So many of them.

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:46.327
They're pulling my feathers!

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:48.369
What are we going to do?

01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:50.522
All right, everybody.
Gather around. Gather around.

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:55.091
An annoying person
asked me once why I wanna be boss.

01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:57.561
Well, I never knew why until today.

01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:00.604
Baby delivery is our true calling.

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:03.206
This is not just a bunch of
metal and glass

01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:06.523
and whatever that giant
magical crystal-looking thing is made of.

01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:10.162
This is the heart of what storks were
put on this Earth to do.

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:11.446
This is our mission.

01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:13.682
We pride ourselves on customer service.

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:16.810
Well, this is a family that never
got the baby they asked for.

01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:18.281
Make a plan.

01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:20.090
Stick to the plan.

01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:21.566
Always deliver.

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:27.646
That's great. This is great.
But we don't have any pods.

01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:31.168
Wait! Everyone, stop. Would you stop?

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:32.321
Hey!

01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:35.282
- What about these?
- Yes!

01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:36.487
Thank you, Jasper!

01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:37.766
I agree.

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:40.571
Baby delivery is what we're born to do.

01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:45.443
Should we do anything about him?

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:46.687
It's...

01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:47.966
It's fine.

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:47.650
They're here! Oh, my gosh.

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:48.926
I can't believe it! They're here!

01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:50.481
They're here!

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:06.441
Aw...

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:15.646
Sign here.

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:16.847
And sign here.

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:18.405
Initial here.

01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:21.530
Initial here, here, and...

01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:44.329
I love you, my little lady.

01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:47.649
And we always will.

01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:49.966
Bye.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.321
Oh, so you deliver to the front door.

01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:55.482
So we didn't have to destroy
our entire house.

01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:56.641
Yeah.

01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:59.041
Yo, Stork! I ordered a brother!

01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:00.686
I ordered a brother!

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:02.882
You wanna feed her her bottle?

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:09.810
Ninja skills.

01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:18.606
You okay?

01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:20.489
Of course. I'm fine.

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:23.682
Oh, this does not feel good.

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:25.649
Is every delivery gonna be like this?

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:28.451
What can I say? It's a terrible business.

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:31.126
I feel so sad all the time.

01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:33.403
No. I'm actually fine now.

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.449
Yeah, it looks like you're
handling stuff real well.

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:37.648
Yeah. Look good, feel good.

01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:39.804
Yeah, pretty cool, man.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.650
Just enjoying it.

01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:44.485
You know, I'm here if you
wanna talk about anything.

01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:45.641
- I'm here to listen.
- Nope.

01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:47.842
Okay, well, it seems like
you're handling it pretty well.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.001
Yeah, I am.

01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:50.525
- You're shaking.
- You're shaking!

01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:52.370
Junior, it's okay
to let your feelings out.

01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:53.521
I'm not feeling.

01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:55.484
- It's healthy.
- I have no feelings!

01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:56.920
Come on, let it out.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.047
Hey.

01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:14.042
We're all right behind you.

01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:18.801
Go on.

01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:31.888
Who is it, honey?

01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:37.764
Who is it, Dad?

01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:45.131
Mom and Dad?

01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:56.846
All right, guys.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.445
We delivered her.

01:20:58.600 --> 01:20:59.601
Let's go.

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:00.841
Junior!

01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:03.250
Where are you going? Get over here.

01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:04.401
Yeah!

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:07.131
- Come on!
- No, no, no.

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:13.811
You love it.
