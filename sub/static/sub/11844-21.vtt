you run to her defense.

38:23.299 --> 38:27.258
Why couldn't you
ever feel that about me?

38:27.336 --> 38:30.169
I'm your wife, Max.

38:30.239 --> 38:32.298
I'm carrying your child.

38:32.375 --> 38:36.141
This was all some kind of plan
to get pregnant and go home, wasn't it?

38:37.747 --> 38:40.842
Home to what, Tess?

38:40.916 --> 38:43.681
To Kivar? To our enemies?

38:43.753 --> 38:47.087
They're not
<i>my</i> enemies, Max.

38:52.028 --> 38:55.760

with Kivar.

No! Nasedo made a deal
4O years ago.

of you to Kivar.

39:11.947 --> 39:14.575
And what would happen
to us once you delivered us?

39:16.652 --> 39:19.087
<i>How did I ever fall in love
with someone like you?</i>

39:19.155 --> 39:21.283
How could I ever
marryyou?

39:21.357 --> 39:24.258
You were different.
You were a king!

39:24.326 --> 39:26.693
Now, you'rejust a boy.

39:28.130 --> 39:31.259

you kill our son.

41:50.139 --> 41:52.198
but I was right
about one thing:

41:52.274 --> 41:56.541
To get you into my life,
