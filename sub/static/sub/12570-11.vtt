00:02.542 --> 00:03.896
Okay, Jessie!

00:03.897 --> 00:05.250
Give me a pop fly!

00:05.292 --> 00:06.959
- I got it...
- I got it...

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
(GROANS)

00:09.083 --> 00:11.042
She got it.

00:11.083 --> 00:12.834
Hey, nice grab.

00:12.835 --> 00:14.584
Thanks. I learned from

00:11.083 --> 00:14.584
watching Derek Jeter.

00:14.626 --> 00:15.793
Are you a Yankees fan?

00:15.794 --> 00:16.959
Of course.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.022
There are only

00:18.023 --> 00:19.042
two types of people.

00:19.083 --> 00:21.230
Those who like the Yankees...

00:21.231 --> 00:23.375
And those who have made

00:19.083 --> 00:23.375
extremely poor life choices.

00:23.417 --> 00:24.668
You're funny,

00:24.669 --> 00:25.918
you're good at sports,

00:23.417 --> 00:25.918
and you're cute.

00:25.959 --> 00:28.000
- I'm Luke.
- I'm all those things, too.

00:29.792 --> 00:30.856
I'm Mackenzie.

00:30.857 --> 00:31.918
Here's your ball back.

00:31.959 --> 00:33.459
I wrote my number on it...

00:33.460 --> 00:34.959
In case you want to

00:31.959 --> 00:34.959
call me some time.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.584
- Maybe I'll
- call you soon.

00:36.626 --> 00:38.042
Maybe I'll answer.

00:38.083 --> 00:40.563
And maybe when you answer

00:40.564 --> 00:43.042
I'll talk to you.

00:43.083 --> 00:44.147
That'd be weird

00:44.148 --> 00:45.209
if you didn't.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.022
Till then.

00:48.023 --> 00:49.042
Okay.

00:56.709 --> 00:59.376
Funny seeing you again...

00:59.377 --> 01:02.042
I mean, in real life,

00:56.709 --> 01:02.042
and not just my nightmares.

01:02.083 --> 01:03.518
- Luke, I really need
- to talk to you.

01:03.542 --> 01:05.382
- Connie, I really need
- to run away from you.

02:10.481 --> 02:12.000
the funniest movie ever.

Actually, Emma,

02:13.043 --> 02:14.043
I need you to work.

02:14.083 --> 02:15.563
We always get a big crowd

02:15.564 --> 02:17.042
after these outdoor movies

02:14.083 --> 02:17.042
in Central Park.

02:17.083 --> 02:18.563
Oh, that's okay,

02:18.564 --> 02:20.042
I really like working here.

- I'm cool
- working the shack alone.

02:26.751 --> 02:27.835
I've come a long way

02:27.836 --> 02:28.918
since you asked me

02:26.751 --> 02:28.918
to marry the ketchups,

02:28.959 --> 02:30.375
- and I hired
- a wedding planner.

02:32.876 --> 02:34.376
I can't believe Creepy Connie

02:34.377 --> 02:35.876
is back from boarding school.

02:35.918 --> 02:37.480
I am sure she wishes to

02:37.481 --> 02:39.042
rekindle our romance.

02:39.083 --> 02:40.813
Poor thing is probably still

02:40.814 --> 02:42.542
reeling from our breakup.

02:43.876 --> 02:45.083
Okay, just stay focused.

02:45.125 --> 02:46.584
You never know when Creepy

02:46.585 --> 02:48.042
Connie is going to strike.

- Die!

Guys, Creepy Connie

02:57.919 --> 02:59.000
made us a creepy crumble!

02:59.959 --> 03:01.043
Guys! I'm not

03:01.044 --> 03:02.125
creepy anymore!

03:02.167 --> 03:03.917
Luke, I have

03:03.918 --> 03:05.667
extinguished the torch

03:02.167 --> 03:05.667
I once carried for you.

03:05.709 --> 03:07.439
Uh, it was

03:07.440 --> 03:09.167
less of a torch

03:05.709 --> 03:09.167
and more of a bonfire.

03:09.209 --> 03:10.355
Do you still

03:10.356 --> 03:11.500
carry my torch, Connie?

03:12.500 --> 03:14.083
I'm sorry, you are?

03:16.083 --> 03:17.834
You must be joking.

03:17.835 --> 03:19.584
We dated for two months.

03:19.626 --> 03:21.397
Remember when we held hands

03:21.398 --> 03:23.167
for 32 and a half seconds

03:19.626 --> 03:23.167
on Valentine's Day?

03:23.209 --> 03:26.042
Still not ringing a bell.

03:26.083 --> 03:27.376
Well, "creepy"

03:27.377 --> 03:28.667
just turned into "awkward."

03:30.083 --> 03:31.105
Ravi, why don't you

03:31.106 --> 03:32.125
go upstairs?

03:32.167 --> 03:33.543
So that I can

03:33.544 --> 03:34.918
find some proof

03:32.167 --> 03:34.918
that Connie and I dated?

03:34.959 --> 03:36.313
(LAUGHS)

03:36.314 --> 03:37.667
No, no, 'cause this is

03:34.959 --> 03:37.667
getting hard to watch.

03:39.667 --> 03:41.334
Luke, I came here

03:41.335 --> 03:43.000
to warn you.

03:39.667 --> 03:43.000
Mackenzie's after you!

03:43.042 --> 03:44.542
Mackenzie?

03:44.543 --> 03:46.042
You mean the cool girl

03:43.042 --> 03:46.042
I met in the park?

03:46.083 --> 03:47.563
Mackenzie's not cool.

03:47.564 --> 03:49.042
She's my roommate

03:46.083 --> 03:49.042
at boarding school.

03:49.083 --> 03:50.583
She's a complete weirdo who is

03:50.584 --> 03:52.083
totally obsessed with you.

03:52.125 --> 03:54.959
Takes one to know one.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.084
Well, if you think

03:56.085 --> 03:57.167
I was bad when I was

03:55.000 --> 03:57.167
crushing on Luke,

03:57.209 --> 03:59.167
- it's nothing compared
- to Mackenzie.

03:59.209 --> 04:00.876
At school, all the girls

04:00.877 --> 04:02.542
call her Mad Mac.

04:02.584 --> 04:04.125
Mackenzie's not mad!

04:04.167 --> 04:05.625
And we just met today.

04:05.626 --> 04:07.083
How could she be

04:04.167 --> 04:07.083
obsessed with me?

04:07.125 --> 04:09.084
Well, I might have

04:09.085 --> 04:11.042
talked about you

04:07.125 --> 04:11.042
for 10 months straight...

04:11.083 --> 04:12.105
Then there was

04:12.106 --> 04:13.125
the shrine...

04:13.167 --> 04:14.355
And the failed cloning

04:14.356 --> 04:15.542
experiment.

04:15.584 --> 04:17.314
But the point is,

04:17.315 --> 04:19.041
Mad Mac is after you!

04:19.083 --> 04:21.041
- Okay, Connie,
- clearly you're making this up

04:21.083 --> 04:23.042
- Just to keep Luke
- from dating another girl.

04:23.083 --> 04:24.250
Well, it won't work.

04:24.292 --> 04:26.059
- I'm calling Mackenzie
- to hang out tonight,

04:26.083 --> 04:27.803
- And there's nothing
- you can do about it.

04:28.250 --> 04:30.000
- Fine, Luke.
- It's your funeral.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.022
No! What if

04:35.023 --> 04:36.042
Connie poisoned it?

04:36.083 --> 04:37.313
You're right.

04:37.314 --> 04:38.542
We should serve it

04:36.083 --> 04:38.542
to Bertram first.

04:38.584 --> 04:39.792
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:43.918 --> 04:45.980
Emma! You've gotta take

04:45.981 --> 04:48.042
a five minute break to watch

04:43.918 --> 04:48.042
the end of this movie.

04:48.083 --> 04:50.000
- I don't know...
- Come on!

04:51.083 --> 04:53.042
Okay, I'm in.

04:53.083 --> 04:54.563
I've only had

04:54.564 --> 04:56.042
two customers since

04:53.083 --> 04:56.042
the movie started anyway,

04:56.083 --> 04:58.059
- and one of them just
- wanted to use our bathroom.

04:58.083 --> 04:59.563
You don't

04:59.564 --> 05:01.042
have a bathroom.

04:58.083 --> 05:01.042
I know.

05:01.083 --> 05:02.709
- Don't walk behind
- the building.

05:08.083 --> 05:10.022
I'm really glad you invited

05:10.023 --> 05:11.959
me over, Luke,

05:08.083 --> 05:11.959
but you seem kinda edgy.

05:12.709 --> 05:15.042
Sorry.

05:15.083 --> 05:17.001
There's this girl who has

05:17.002 --> 05:18.918
a creepy obsession with me,

05:15.083 --> 05:18.918
and she keeps breaking in.

05:18.959 --> 05:20.840
- Note to self,
- get a lock for the dumbwaiter.

05:22.959 --> 05:24.585
Oh, you must mean Connie.

05:24.586 --> 05:26.209
She's my roommate

05:22.959 --> 05:26.209
at boarding school.

05:26.250 --> 05:28.147
Wait, so you do know her?

05:28.148 --> 05:30.042
I thought she made that up

05:26.250 --> 05:30.042
to get between you and me.

05:30.083 --> 05:31.459
Oh, don't be silly.

05:31.460 --> 05:32.834
Connie wouldn't come

05:30.083 --> 05:32.834
between us.

05:32.876 --> 05:34.460
She's totally over you.

05:34.461 --> 05:36.042
She even took down her

05:32.876 --> 05:36.042
shrine to you last month.

05:36.083 --> 05:38.042
- Oh.
- But don't worry...

05:38.083 --> 05:39.709
I dug it out of the trash.

05:42.083 --> 05:44.000
Oh.

05:45.083 --> 05:49.042
I, uh... I wasn't worried...

05:49.083 --> 05:51.000
- But I'm starting
- to get there now.

05:52.959 --> 05:54.501
I made this for you.

05:54.502 --> 05:56.042
Try it on.

05:56.083 --> 05:57.501
How nice of you.

05:57.502 --> 05:58.918
Are these pearls?

05:58.959 --> 06:01.042
No, they're my baby teeth.

06:01.083 --> 06:02.334
(SHRIEKS)

06:03.834 --> 06:06.709
Aw, you don't like that one?

06:06.751 --> 06:07.855
I guess I'll have to

06:07.856 --> 06:08.959
make you another.

06:11.834 --> 06:13.356
Connie was telling

06:13.357 --> 06:14.876
the truth!

06:11.834 --> 06:14.876
You really are mad!

06:16.292 --> 06:17.876
Mad about you!

06:19.000 --> 06:20.022
We were

06:20.023 --> 06:21.042
meant to be together.

06:21.083 --> 06:23.042
- I will never
- leave your side.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.959
The only question is...

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Which wrist do you want

06:26.001 --> 06:27.001
the handcuff on?

06:27.292 --> 06:29.918
Right or left?

06:31.250 --> 06:33.876
Excellent question...

06:33.918 --> 06:34.980
Let me think about...

06:34.981 --> 06:36.042
(YELLING) Help!

06:36.083 --> 06:38.000
CONNIE: I'll save you, Luke!

06:39.834 --> 06:41.250

- Mac!

06:48.083 --> 06:51.876

06:51.918 --> 06:53.959
I've been wanting to do that

06:53.960 --> 06:56.000
ever since you snagged

06:51.918 --> 06:56.000
the top bunk in our dorm room.

06:57.209 --> 06:58.605
Connie!

06:58.606 --> 07:00.000
I knew you were

06:57.209 --> 07:00.000
still after Luke!

07:00.042 --> 07:01.542
A creepy leopard

07:01.543 --> 07:03.042
doesn't change

07:00.042 --> 07:03.042
its creepy spots!

07:03.083 --> 07:04.563
No, you're wrong!

07:04.564 --> 07:06.042
Connie's the one

07:03.083 --> 07:06.042
who saved me!

07:06.083 --> 07:07.751
Mackenzie really is Mad Mac!

07:07.792 --> 07:09.272
Is it mad to want

07:09.273 --> 07:10.751
to handcuff myself

07:07.792 --> 07:10.751
to the love of my life

07:10.792 --> 07:12.143
- so we never spend
- a moment apart?

07:12.167 --> 07:14.042
- Yes!
- Of course!

07:14.083 --> 07:16.000
- I see where you're
- coming from, but yeah.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.250
Nothing can keep us apart!

07:19.292 --> 07:20.459
Connie, my bag, please.

07:23.083 --> 07:24.167
By the way,

07:24.168 --> 07:25.250
I really love

07:23.083 --> 07:25.250
your sweater.

for just five minutes

16:34.918 --> 16:38.459

Nope.

23:36.564 --> 23:38.042
owe me $600.

23:38.083 --> 23:39.209
Sorry, I spent

23:39.210 --> 23:40.334
all my money

23:38.083 --> 23:40.334
on the wedding.

23:40.375 --> 23:41.688
I love you,

23:41.689 --> 23:43.000
Lukie-Pookie!

23:43.042 --> 23:44.209
Good seeing you again, Ravi.

23:44.250 --> 23:45.585
Ha! I knew

23:45.586 --> 23:46.918
you remembered me!

23:46.959 --> 23:49.147
I did the whole time.

23:49.148 --> 23:51.334
I was just embarrassed

23:46.959 --> 23:51.334
that I had dated you.

23:51.375 --> 23:53.000
It still counts!

23:54.125 --> 23:56.042
- Good riddance,
- Creepy Connie.

23:56.083 --> 23:57.126
Don't call me

23:57.127 --> 23:58.167
Creepy Connie!

23:58.209 --> 24:00.626
Call me

24:00.627 --> 24:03.042
Creepy Connie-Ross!

23:58.209 --> 24:03.042
(LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY)

24:03.083 --> 24:04.418
All you single ladies,

24:04.419 --> 24:05.751
get ready for the bouquet.

24:05.792 --> 24:07.375
- Oh!
- Ha!

24:08.459 --> 24:09.876
It's mine, hah!

24:09.918 --> 24:11.064
Better not take down those

24:11.065 --> 24:12.209
decorations on the terrace,

24:12.250 --> 24:13.730
'cause Jessie's

24:13.731 --> 24:15.209
gonna land

24:12.250 --> 24:15.209
herself a man.
