00:33.300 --> 00:35.801
Is that

Yes.

00:35.803 --> 00:37.136
I just lied
to francis for you!

00:37.138 --> 00:38.170
You made a mistake

00:38.172 --> 00:39.571
And now you have to fix it

00:39.573 --> 00:41.673
Before it destroys
my marriage.

00:41.675 --> 00:43.042
My family is depending on me

00:43.044 --> 00:44.410
To bring home a title and lands.

00:44.412 --> 00:46.045
You're a servant.

00:46.047 --> 00:47.679
Lord castleroy has offered me
an apprenticeship

00:47.681 --> 00:50.716
Bash: <i>The night</i>
<i>francis' men were escorting me</i>

00:50.718 --> 00:52.217
<i>Out of the country,</i>
<i>they tried to kill me.</i>

00:52.219 --> 00:53.819
On his orders, I believe.

00:53.821 --> 00:55.354
Francis wouldn't. You know that.

00:55.356 --> 00:57.322
It's the darkness.
I won't rest until it's dead.

00:57.324 --> 00:58.724
You can't fight it.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.292
Nostradamus:
What happened to the poor girl?

01:00.294 --> 01:02.061
There's a dark malignant power
in the woods.

01:02.063 --> 01:03.762
<i>That creature</i>
<i>that requires blood.</i>

01:03.764 --> 01:04.696
The darkness.

01:04.698 --> 01:09.435
<i>It will take us all.</i>

01:30.858 --> 01:32.291
The nightmares again?

01:32.293 --> 01:34.259
(door closes)

01:36.296 --> 01:38.330
(panting): What I endured while
I was captive in that cave

01:38.332 --> 01:39.398
Will always be a part of me.

01:40.533 --> 01:41.867
(breathing heavily):
The darkness...

01:41.869 --> 01:43.569
Can't reach you anymore.

01:43.571 --> 01:46.271
(continues breathing heavily)

01:48.441 --> 01:50.442
When the body
endures a trauma,

01:50.444 --> 01:52.644
It's hard for the mind
to let go.

01:52.646 --> 01:55.180
Don't let your mind
sabotage you.

01:55.182 --> 01:56.381
You're ready

01:56.383 --> 01:57.783
To rejoin society.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.319
(gasps)

02:00.321 --> 02:01.887
I'm sorry.

02:01.889 --> 02:03.388
I only meant...
(panting):
No. It's not you.

02:03.390 --> 02:05.591
It hurts.

02:05.593 --> 02:07.459
My back.

02:07.461 --> 02:08.527
May I?

02:14.634 --> 02:16.268
(panting)

02:17.403 --> 02:19.238
What is it?

02:19.240 --> 02:21.507
I thought all your wounds
were healing...

02:21.509 --> 02:23.876
But this one's
become infected.

02:23.878 --> 02:25.444
I need to drain it.

02:31.217 --> 02:32.518
(skin ripping)

02:32.520 --> 02:34.520
(moans, breathing heavily)

02:34.522 --> 02:38.357
There, the wound
should begin to...

02:38.359 --> 02:39.458
Wait...

02:41.528 --> 02:42.528
There's something inside.

02:42.530 --> 02:44.163
(metal clinks)

02:45.932 --> 02:47.266
Brace yourself, olivia.

02:47.268 --> 02:49.635
(panting)

02:50.570 --> 02:52.504
(short heavy breathing)

02:57.777 --> 03:01.747
Marquis (echoing):
But when the baron insults me,
he also insults you, king henry.

03:01.749 --> 03:04.683
I must ask that you
send your forces to guyenne

03:04.685 --> 03:06.752
To demonstrate your power
and <i>my</i> authority.

03:08.388 --> 03:10.222
Your majesty?

03:11.457 --> 03:13.559
(inhales deeply)
marquis duveaux.

03:13.561 --> 03:15.794
When you last presented me
with your grievance,

03:15.796 --> 03:18.630
But, your majesty,
the baron disrespects...

03:18.632 --> 03:20.265
Clearly you did
not listen,

03:20.267 --> 03:21.867
Because I ordered you
to return home

03:21.869 --> 03:23.635
And to bend the baron
to your authority,

03:23.637 --> 03:26.305
By your own power.

03:26.307 --> 03:27.839
This has been
the source of my fury.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.942
People who refuse
to listen to their king.

03:29.944 --> 03:34.479
Or... Are your ears
full of wax, hmm?

03:34.481 --> 03:37.416
Hold him down.

03:37.418 --> 03:38.684
What are you doing?
Just so.

03:38.686 --> 03:41.520
(marquis grunts)

03:41.522 --> 03:43.455
Please, your majesty.

03:43.457 --> 03:44.523
(panting):
I beg you.

03:46.292 --> 03:47.292
(marquis screaming)

03:47.294 --> 03:48.860
Henry?! Henry!

03:48.862 --> 03:49.928
What are you doing?!

03:49.930 --> 03:51.964
Teaching the marquis a lesson.

03:51.966 --> 03:53.565
Catherine:
Not like this; he's a nobleman.

03:53.567 --> 03:56.802
I understand you canceled the
queen of the bean celebration.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.270
Now we're talking
about a party.

03:58.272 --> 03:59.738
I know what you're
trying to do.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.673
You're trying to hide
me from my own court.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.809
Perhaps you're trying to
poison me as well, hmm?

04:03.811 --> 04:05.744
(sighs)
I'm not trying to

04:05.746 --> 04:07.346
Poison you, henry.

04:07.348 --> 04:08.847
I'm concerned.

04:08.849 --> 04:10.949
What's wrong with you

04:10.951 --> 04:12.317
Isn't any poison
I've delivered,

04:12.319 --> 04:13.352
I swear to you.

04:13.354 --> 04:15.287
But you <i>are</i> ill.

04:15.289 --> 04:16.822
You could do harm
to yourself, to France.

04:16.824 --> 04:19.458
I have headaches.
They come and go, but...

04:19.460 --> 04:21.760
My mind is sharper than
it's ever been before.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.829
And the queen of the bean
is nearly my

04:23.831 --> 04:25.597
Favorite event
of the year.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.633
It will proceed,
as usual.

04:29.569 --> 04:31.436
(indistinct conversation,
laughter)

04:31.438 --> 04:35.340
So any servant
can become queen for the day?

04:35.342 --> 04:36.642
I don't remember this tradition.

04:36.644 --> 04:37.909
It's 'cause we were children.

04:37.911 --> 04:39.778
I think my mother hid it
from us for a while.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.346
Ah.

04:41.348 --> 04:43.782
My father welcomes
the temporary queen

04:43.784 --> 04:44.783
In his own way.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.318
In his bed.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.053
(chuckles)
if the girl who finds the bean

04:48.055 --> 04:50.055
In her slice of cake
happens to be pretty.

04:50.057 --> 04:53.358
She wears my mother's crown,
the finest clothes,

04:53.360 --> 04:54.993
And spends the day
ordering servants around.

04:54.995 --> 04:57.629
By dawn, she has a hundred
ducats, a pile of gifts,

04:57.631 --> 04:59.398
But she is a
servant girl once more.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.533
A true fairy tale ending.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.535
It's a tradition
I always prefer to avoid.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.937
Especially when
diane de poitiers was here.

05:05.939 --> 05:08.674
To watch my father juggling
a mistress, my mother...

05:08.676 --> 05:09.808
And the bean queen.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.543
(laughing)

05:11.545 --> 05:14.479
Bash and I always
fled for a hunt.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.815
It's all right to miss him.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.817
Even though he angered you.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.552
(children laughing)

05:20.554 --> 05:22.554
Well, at least the bean
gives them something new

05:22.556 --> 05:23.889
To gossip about.

05:23.891 --> 05:25.824
It's the first time in weeks

05:25.826 --> 05:27.693
That no one's pestered me
about giving you heirs.

05:27.695 --> 05:28.927
Perhaps I should pester you.

05:33.099 --> 05:34.633
Kenna:
Mary,

05:34.635 --> 05:36.034
Greer's ready to
present him to you now.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.502
Who?

05:37.504 --> 05:39.705
Lord julien.
Greer's fiancé.

05:39.707 --> 05:42.107
(indistinct conversation)

05:44.577 --> 05:46.578
Such a gorgeous cake
and they're not even eating it.

05:51.384 --> 05:53.585
We should send the losers
a consolation gift.

05:53.587 --> 05:54.586
Don't you think?

05:54.588 --> 05:55.987
He arrived two days ago.

05:55.989 --> 05:57.456
Isn't he adorable?

05:57.458 --> 05:59.991
Lola:
They've had some talks

05:59.993 --> 06:02.127
And greer says
he's quite nice.
And quite rich.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.596
Why can't the king
find me a husband like that?

06:04.598 --> 06:05.864
We've been here a year,

06:05.866 --> 06:07.466
All but rotting on the vine.

06:08.968 --> 06:11.036
Lord julien,
may I introduce you to

06:11.038 --> 06:12.704
Her majesty,
mary, queen of scots.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.840
And her ladies,
lola and kenna.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.608
Your majesty,

06:16.610 --> 06:18.443
It is an honor.
Lord julien,

06:18.445 --> 06:19.745
It's such a pleasure
to finally meet you.

06:19.747 --> 06:21.012
I hear that your family's from
hungary.

06:21.014 --> 06:22.814
Yes. My parents
know greer's father

06:22.816 --> 06:24.049
Through a distant cousin.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.417
We corresponded

06:25.419 --> 06:26.618
And the rest is history.

06:26.620 --> 06:27.853
I hope you'll find it

06:27.855 --> 06:30.455
In your heart
to bless our engagement.

06:30.457 --> 06:33.125
If this is what your father
wishes-- and you of course.

06:33.127 --> 06:34.993
It is. Very much.

06:36.496 --> 06:37.929
Well then, (claps)
you're engaged.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.664
(julien laughs)
mary: Enjoy your lives together.

06:39.666 --> 06:41.533
(laughter)

06:41.535 --> 06:42.901
I'm so happy for you, greer.

06:44.871 --> 06:46.571
He's certainly
a step up from castleroy.

06:46.573 --> 06:47.806
Yeah.

06:47.808 --> 06:50.142
Lord castleroy,
can I get you anything?

06:50.144 --> 06:52.043
No. No need. You're busy.

06:52.045 --> 06:54.012
(laughs)
just think, tomorrow

06:54.014 --> 06:56.548
You'll be my apprentice
in the spice trade.

06:56.550 --> 06:58.083
You'll leave all this behind.

06:59.485 --> 07:01.553
Will you miss it?

07:01.555 --> 07:03.488
(clears throat)

07:03.490 --> 07:04.856
I'm very grateful, sir.

07:08.828 --> 07:11.963
Lola, I have some bad news.

07:11.965 --> 07:14.533
The suitor from alsace has
been delayed for five weeks.

07:14.535 --> 07:17.636
I'm going to start to show
any day now.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.638
Lola, I promised you I'd
find you a husband and I will.

07:19.640 --> 07:20.939
Just give me another week,

07:20.941 --> 07:22.441
Maybe two.

07:26.779 --> 07:29.948
I see your plan to keep the king
out of sight has failed.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.583
Who else knows of his madness?

07:31.585 --> 07:33.051
Only kenna.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.986
<i>And</i> a nobleman from guyenne.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.456
I've given both motivation
to keep quiet.

07:37.458 --> 07:38.790
But there's no telling

07:38.792 --> 07:40.559
What henry will do next.
(sighs)

07:40.561 --> 07:41.827
Have you found

07:41.829 --> 07:44.062
<i>Any</i> explanation for this?

07:44.064 --> 07:45.931
I've checked his food and wine
for three days straight.

07:45.933 --> 07:47.833
There's no trace
of any poison.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.534
At least none
that I recognize.

07:50.102 --> 07:51.837
Then he is mad.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.805
And a mad
king incites

07:53.807 --> 07:55.974
Chaos and rebellion.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.209
If our enemies find out,
we could...

07:57.211 --> 07:58.677
Your majesty...

07:59.946 --> 08:01.112
What's this?

08:01.114 --> 08:03.181
A sedative that
induces a coma.

08:03.183 --> 08:05.083
A deep sleep that
I can interrupt

08:05.085 --> 08:06.852
With an antidote
of my own design.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.119
It'll be difficult.

08:08.121 --> 08:09.821
He has seven tasters,

08:09.823 --> 08:11.957
Inspecting every manner
of delivery.

08:11.959 --> 08:13.124
We have to find a way

08:13.126 --> 08:15.060
To get it past them.

08:15.062 --> 08:16.528
A trojan horse.

08:16.530 --> 08:17.762
(woman screams)

08:17.764 --> 08:19.130
Woman:
Yes! Yes! I've won!

08:19.132 --> 08:20.699
The bean!

08:20.701 --> 08:21.800
I found the bean!

08:21.802 --> 08:22.868
(sniffles)

08:24.003 --> 08:25.136
(applause)

08:28.574 --> 08:30.075
What is your name?

08:30.077 --> 08:32.677
Uh... Penelope.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.946
From the kitchen.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.815
Well, you're very pretty.
(panting)

08:36.817 --> 08:38.617
Penelope...

08:38.619 --> 08:40.752
I crown you...

08:42.755 --> 08:44.890
Queen of the bean.

08:45.625 --> 08:46.691
(applause)

08:53.065 --> 08:55.300
(applause, cheering)

09:09.115 --> 09:11.182
Ask and ye shall receive.

09:18.024 --> 09:19.891
I need to speak with the king.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.126
It's the bastard!

09:21.128 --> 09:23.995
I surrender to the king's mercy.

09:23.997 --> 09:27.299
Father, I need
to speak with you.

09:27.301 --> 09:28.800
You return from exile
seeking favor?

09:28.802 --> 09:30.302
After you killed
your brother's guards?

09:30.304 --> 09:32.203
It was self-defense.
Take him to the dungeon.

09:32.205 --> 09:34.039
There's a threat in the woods,
that's why I've returned.

09:34.041 --> 09:35.340
Father. Father,
you must listen to me.

09:35.342 --> 09:36.775
I mean you no harm,

09:36.777 --> 09:37.943
But there are people
who are being harmed.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.077
Murdered!

09:39.079 --> 09:40.345
I can't believe he came back.

09:40.347 --> 09:42.213
What was he thinking?

09:42.215 --> 09:44.015
Father, you must!
Francis:
We have given
him every chance

09:44.017 --> 09:45.884
To be free and
yet here he is.

09:45.886 --> 09:48.820
I'm done helping him.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.822
Francis, he's your brother.

09:50.824 --> 09:52.290
He's a liar and a murderer.

09:53.893 --> 09:56.294
We both know why he came back.

09:56.296 --> 09:58.630
Don't give him another chance
to get close to you.

10:08.708 --> 10:11.209
(chain rattles)

10:11.211 --> 10:14.746
We don't have much time,
so listen carefully.

10:14.748 --> 10:17.048
I've bribed your jailer.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.984
A merchant's wagon will take
you to the spanish border.

10:18.986 --> 10:20.652
If you value your life,

10:20.654 --> 10:22.187
You will do as I say
and you will never return.

10:22.189 --> 10:23.655
I'm not ready to go to Spain.

10:23.657 --> 10:24.923
Bash, what is wrong with you?

10:24.925 --> 10:26.124
You never should have
returned here.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.759
You have to leave.

10:27.761 --> 10:29.160
There are too many in the castle
who want you dead.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.663
You mean francis?

10:31.665 --> 10:33.865
He did not try
to have you killed.

10:34.734 --> 10:36.334
Although he could.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.203
You stir up
a jealousy

10:38.205 --> 10:40.805
And a bitterness in him
that scares me.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.407
He gets this look
in his eyes.

10:42.409 --> 10:45.210
It's like I don't know him.

10:45.212 --> 10:47.078
It's almost as if he knows.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.813
That you'd have been
happy without him.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.749
If you had married me instead.

10:50.751 --> 10:55.186
There is nothing between you and
I except for my concern for you.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.822
Then we've arrived
at the same spot.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.691
I'm here on
behalf of another,

10:59.693 --> 11:01.359
A girl I met in the woods.
Well,

11:01.361 --> 11:03.695
Bully for you
and your speedy recovery.
Don't.

11:03.697 --> 11:06.064
Not until you hear
what happened to her.

11:08.300 --> 11:10.435
Catherine:
<i>Queen penelope.</i>

11:10.437 --> 11:13.138
Every year a girl
is chosen.

11:13.140 --> 11:15.840
Yes.

11:15.842 --> 11:17.242
And for a brief moment,

11:17.244 --> 11:20.412
She glimpses the
heavens of royalty.

11:20.414 --> 11:23.248
Ah, it's the greatest night
of her life.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.917
But when the dawn comes,

11:25.919 --> 11:27.919
She must fall back to earth.

11:27.921 --> 11:30.121
Oh, it must be a brutal fall.

11:30.123 --> 11:32.457
Oh. It's all right.

11:32.459 --> 11:36.061
I mean, this is
so much more than I ever...

11:36.063 --> 11:38.263
I ever even dreamed of.

11:38.265 --> 11:39.798
But it's only one day.

11:39.800 --> 11:43.168
And I...

11:43.170 --> 11:46.771
Would like you to be the first
queen of the bean in history

11:46.773 --> 11:48.873
To think long-term.

11:48.875 --> 11:51.142
So if you prove
yourself trustworthy,

11:51.144 --> 11:54.179
We can be friends.
And unlike henry,

11:54.181 --> 11:56.181
I look after my friends
every day of the year,

11:56.183 --> 11:57.949
Not just this one.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.751
Tell me,

11:59.753 --> 12:01.086
Queen penelope,

12:01.088 --> 12:02.821
Have you maintained your virtue?

12:02.823 --> 12:04.723
Of course I have.
(chuckles)

12:04.725 --> 12:07.759
Because-- well,
as you may know--

12:07.761 --> 12:09.260
When pretty girls

12:09.262 --> 12:10.795
Win queen of the bean,

12:10.797 --> 12:13.064
They sometimes have a...

12:13.066 --> 12:16.501
Special experience
with the king.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.403
Oh?
I must warn you
that the king's...

12:18.405 --> 12:20.972
Appetite in his bedchambers

12:20.974 --> 12:22.273
Can be quite...

12:22.275 --> 12:23.408
Rough.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.210
He has the
appetite of a lion

12:25.212 --> 12:26.911
And the stamina of a horse,

12:26.913 --> 12:29.013
A horse that proceeds
at a steady,

12:29.015 --> 12:31.049
Punishing trot.

12:31.051 --> 12:32.450
It can be a...

12:32.452 --> 12:35.253
Lengthy experience.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.756
Well... How lengthy?

12:37.758 --> 12:39.891
It can feel like hours.
Sometimes it is.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.760
But...

12:41.762 --> 12:43.094
If we're to be friends,

12:43.096 --> 12:45.764
I can help you.
(chuckles)

12:49.435 --> 12:51.102
This is an
aphrodisiac.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.837
It'll help the king... Gallop

12:52.839 --> 12:54.472
More quickly to the finish.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.040
Pour the contents
of this

12:56.042 --> 12:57.142
Into his wine.

12:57.144 --> 12:58.343
Get him
to drink it.

12:58.345 --> 13:00.378
It will thrill him

13:00.380 --> 13:04.048
And satisfy him, and you will be
on to more gowns

13:04.050 --> 13:05.450
And jewels

13:05.452 --> 13:08.019
And the feast.

13:13.959 --> 13:16.060
I came down here
because I was worried about you,

13:16.062 --> 13:18.396
And here I find you
with my wife. Again.

13:18.398 --> 13:21.332
Should I feign surprise?
It's not what it looks like.

13:21.334 --> 13:22.967
He didn't come for me.
Oh, even you can't
believe that.

13:22.969 --> 13:24.402
I'm back for
the castle's resources,

13:24.404 --> 13:26.871
Its armed men
and horses,

13:26.873 --> 13:29.941
To seek out and destroy
a threat in the woods.

13:29.943 --> 13:32.343
And then I will leave.
I promise.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.379
What threat?
You've seen

13:34.381 --> 13:36.214
The sacrifices
in the blood wood.

13:36.216 --> 13:39.117
These pagans endanger every man,
woman and child in the realm.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.219
They threatened your own wife.

13:41.221 --> 13:44.956
And they do it all
in service to a monster
they call the darkness.

13:44.958 --> 13:47.258
I know how it sounds...
You sound as ignorant
as those pagans.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.393
A monster

13:48.395 --> 13:50.161
In the woods?
I saw it,

13:50.163 --> 13:51.863
In the shadows,
myself.

13:51.865 --> 13:54.499
It took a girl,
a girl I cared for.

13:54.501 --> 13:57.869
Her name was rowan,
and now she is certainly dead.

13:57.871 --> 14:00.271
However badly you want me
gone, I promise, I want it

14:00.273 --> 14:02.307
A thousand times more,
but I'm not leaving

14:02.309 --> 14:03.508
Until the woods are safe.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.176
Mary, leave us please.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.544
I know you don't
believe me.

14:06.546 --> 14:08.913
But there's someone
you will believe.

14:08.915 --> 14:10.915
And who is that?

14:10.917 --> 14:12.984
The darkness has claimed
countless victims.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.252
Only one survived.

14:14.254 --> 14:16.487
Your old flame,
olivia d'amencourt.

14:16.489 --> 14:19.958
And she's here in
this castle right now.

14:23.963 --> 14:26.464
(knocking)

14:28.267 --> 14:29.601
Leith,
what are you doing here?

14:29.603 --> 14:31.069
We've said
our good-byes.

14:32.338 --> 14:34.339
I had to see you,

14:34.341 --> 14:36.140
Just once more.

14:36.142 --> 14:38.109
Look, I wanted to tell you...

14:38.111 --> 14:41.112
No, don't.
Why?

14:41.114 --> 14:43.615
Because you're engaged to
another man who you barely know?

14:43.617 --> 14:46.618
That's not at all unusual
for someone like me.

14:46.620 --> 14:48.353
Because you're highborn.

14:48.355 --> 14:51.089
And he's rich
and titled

14:51.091 --> 14:53.091
And very kind to the servants.

14:53.093 --> 14:54.359
And to me.

14:54.361 --> 14:56.094
He seems...

14:56.096 --> 14:58.396
Everything I ever wanted.

15:01.200 --> 15:04.402
Except he's not you.

15:17.950 --> 15:19.250
(panting)

15:21.320 --> 15:23.922
(gasps)
woman:
Excuse me, my lady.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.156
Greer?
Lord julien,

15:25.158 --> 15:26.157
I...

15:26.159 --> 15:27.325
Who are you?
I'm no one.

15:27.327 --> 15:28.493
I'm a servant. I-I fancied her

15:28.495 --> 15:30.295
And-and she was
kind so I stole

15:30.297 --> 15:31.930
The kiss.
Leith, no.

15:31.932 --> 15:34.966
She asked me not to,
but I was overcome.

15:34.968 --> 15:36.234
She is free
of blame in this.

15:36.236 --> 15:38.503
My-my advance was unwanted!

15:38.505 --> 15:40.238
I don't want
him harmed,

15:40.240 --> 15:42.440
But his household will have
to know of this.

15:44.576 --> 15:47.145
(sighs)

15:49.381 --> 15:51.616
I was going to leave this
in your room...

15:51.618 --> 15:53.618
It wasn't his fault.
(chuckles)

15:53.620 --> 15:55.320
Is that supposed
to make it better?

15:55.322 --> 15:57.121
I'm so sorry.

15:57.123 --> 16:00.124
I know these things happen.

16:00.126 --> 16:02.527
But they can't with my wife.

16:02.529 --> 16:05.596
I-I can't have this kind of
gossip surrounding my family.

16:05.598 --> 16:07.332
I can't have this.

16:07.334 --> 16:09.600
I'll be ruined
if you don't marry me.

16:09.602 --> 16:13.004
I wish I could.

16:13.006 --> 16:15.340
I-I wish I were a better man

16:15.342 --> 16:17.408
Who could marry
you despite this.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.410
But I'm not.

16:19.412 --> 16:22.013
I'm sorry.

16:27.419 --> 16:30.388
(crying)

16:43.102 --> 16:45.236
Olivia, we're so sorry.
Everything that
you endured,

16:45.238 --> 16:47.071
We thought...
I thought that you escaped

16:47.073 --> 16:48.306
Through the tunnels that night.

16:48.308 --> 16:49.440
I did.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.175
But I was found
by those heretics,

16:51.177 --> 16:53.044
Fed to that monster.

16:54.580 --> 16:56.080
Do you believe me now?

16:56.082 --> 16:58.116
This creature is the cause
of all the horrors

16:58.118 --> 16:59.517
In those woods.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.719
If you want to protect
your realm from these devils,

17:01.721 --> 17:03.621
You must kill the monster
they serve.

17:03.623 --> 17:05.723
I don't believe in
monsters. I never have.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.392
But I do believe in fear.

17:07.394 --> 17:09.093
And whoever this
darkness is,

17:09.095 --> 17:10.361
The pagans fear him enough
to terrorize

17:10.363 --> 17:11.596
And slaughter my people.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.364
Mary:
Olivia, do you think

17:13.366 --> 17:16.534
That you could retrace your
steps, lead us back to the cave?

17:16.536 --> 17:19.437
No.

17:19.439 --> 17:22.407
All I remember is a meadow
lined with fir trees,

17:22.409 --> 17:25.176
Hugged by a curving field
of snow.

17:25.178 --> 17:26.344
Bash:
I know a meadow
with some firs

17:26.346 --> 17:28.613
I'll gather my guards.
You'll forgive me,

17:28.615 --> 17:30.081
But the last time I went

17:30.083 --> 17:31.482
With your men,
they tried to kill me.

17:31.484 --> 17:34.152
I gave no such order,
and we could confirm that

17:34.154 --> 17:35.820
If you hadn't slaughtered them.
Francis.

17:35.822 --> 17:38.523
This time I'm going with you.

17:38.525 --> 17:40.792
We'll find that cave and
kill whatever hides within.

17:40.794 --> 17:43.828
And then I am personally putting
you on the next boat to Spain.

17:46.632 --> 17:48.166
Then we're agreed.

17:48.168 --> 17:49.801
You can't just kill it!

17:49.803 --> 17:52.804
This isn't some outlaw
hiding in the trees!

17:52.806 --> 17:54.739
The darkness is a creature
from hell.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.474
It's not human.
(door opens)

17:56.476 --> 17:58.443
Nostradamus:
He is human,

17:58.445 --> 18:00.611
I assure you.

18:00.613 --> 18:03.481
I found this embedded
in olivia's wound.

18:03.483 --> 18:05.817
It looked like the fang
of some wild beast,

18:05.819 --> 18:08.519
But the root of this tooth
is like yours or mine.

18:08.521 --> 18:14.258
This fang is a human tooth,
filed down into a sharp point.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.127
Mary:
Human? But why
would a man go

18:16.129 --> 18:19.163
To such lengths?
For function,
perhaps. To better

18:19.165 --> 18:20.665
Feed on victims.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.133
But I assure you,

18:22.135 --> 18:23.634
This darkness

18:23.636 --> 18:25.736
Is only a man.

18:27.706 --> 18:29.140
Then go and kill him.

18:29.142 --> 18:30.541
And remember

18:30.543 --> 18:31.742
Who the real enemy is.

18:39.251 --> 18:42.820
(sniffles)
do you know what happens
to servants like leith?

18:42.822 --> 18:45.823
They say he'll get the lash
until his back is

18:45.825 --> 18:48.793
Split open
and he can no longer stand.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.129
He'll spend years
in that cell.

18:51.131 --> 18:53.431
(sniffles)
I love him.
You can't

18:53.433 --> 18:55.433
Love a servant,
you simply can't.

18:55.435 --> 18:57.168
Not that
what I did

18:57.170 --> 18:59.303
Was much better.
But it is.
(sniffles)

18:59.305 --> 19:01.172
Mistresses of the king
are often revered,

19:01.174 --> 19:03.274
But-but this...

19:03.276 --> 19:06.577
My family will fall into ruin
for what I've done.

19:06.579 --> 19:08.646
I'll never be able
to face them again.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.749
It's not that dire yet.
The gossip
is already spreading.

19:11.751 --> 19:15.520
These rumors will follow me
everywhere.

19:15.522 --> 19:17.855
I have no future.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.690
Mary:
Greer, don't
say that.

19:19.692 --> 19:21.592
Never say that.

19:22.895 --> 19:25.897
Mary...
(sniffles)

19:25.899 --> 19:27.765
So you've heard.

19:27.767 --> 19:30.201
I'm so ashamed.

19:30.203 --> 19:31.936
Please don't be.

19:31.938 --> 19:34.272
Look at us.

19:34.274 --> 19:36.774
Look where our hearts
have led us.

19:36.776 --> 19:39.243
We've brought you
shame.

19:39.245 --> 19:40.845
Well, all but lola.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.848
In truth,

19:43.850 --> 19:45.416
There's something
you should know.

19:46.218 --> 19:48.319
(sighs)

19:48.321 --> 19:51.422
Henry:
<i>Why is the queen of scotland</i>
<i>so concerned</i>

19:51.424 --> 19:52.957
With the fate of a kitchen boy?

19:52.959 --> 19:55.426
Leith saved many
lives at the siege.

19:55.428 --> 19:58.362
In light of his bravery,
I feel that his sentence
should be reduced.

19:58.364 --> 20:00.364
This kitchen boy seems
to have friends in high places.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.466
You're not the first
to plead on his behalf.

20:02.468 --> 20:04.435
Lord castleroy
has arranged that.

20:04.437 --> 20:06.237
In lieu of prison,
he's been conscripted

20:06.239 --> 20:07.572
For military service.

20:07.574 --> 20:10.441
He departs
for training tomorrow.

20:10.443 --> 20:12.610
Ah, my queen.

20:12.612 --> 20:14.845
What a vision.

20:14.847 --> 20:16.447
Isn't she lovely, mary?

20:16.449 --> 20:18.649
Yes, it takes
a very special kind of woman

20:18.651 --> 20:19.850
To catch my eye

20:19.852 --> 20:21.252
And ignite my passion.

20:21.254 --> 20:22.553
Hmm?
(belt clatters)

20:22.555 --> 20:24.555
I should go.
No, no, no, no.

20:24.557 --> 20:28.893
Stay. Now that you've given
your virtue to my son,

20:28.895 --> 20:32.763
Perhaps you can show penelope
a thing or two about how to...

20:32.765 --> 20:34.932
Please a ruler.

20:34.934 --> 20:37.368
Go on.
Pretend she's...

20:37.370 --> 20:39.670
Francis. I'll watch.

20:39.672 --> 20:42.473
(chuckles)
oh, you aren't serious?

20:42.475 --> 20:43.741
Mm-hmm.

20:43.743 --> 20:46.510
This isn't like you.

20:46.512 --> 20:48.779
Are you feeling unwell,
your grace?

20:48.781 --> 20:51.015
I am anointed by god.

20:51.017 --> 20:53.351
You are as well.
We are royals.

20:53.353 --> 20:54.685
What could ever be...

20:54.687 --> 20:57.755
Unwell with us, hmm?

20:59.324 --> 21:00.925
I know exactly
what you're talking about.

21:02.461 --> 21:05.396
May I borrow penelope
for a minute?

21:05.398 --> 21:07.531
I have some
royal customs and-and

21:07.533 --> 21:09.667
Clothes to share with her.

21:09.669 --> 21:11.369
Penelope, if you would?

21:11.371 --> 21:13.304
(clears throat)

21:13.306 --> 21:15.306
I suppose...

21:15.308 --> 21:16.807
The queen shall stay.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.876
I'm fine,
run along.

21:23.682 --> 21:24.849
Dear henry,

21:24.851 --> 21:27.852
When we last... Talked,

21:27.854 --> 21:29.820
You spoke to me
about bondage.

21:29.822 --> 21:31.922
You seem familiar
with the practice.

21:31.924 --> 21:33.457
Servants talk.

21:33.459 --> 21:34.925
I hear you like it.

21:34.927 --> 21:36.060
(soft laugh)

21:36.062 --> 21:37.662
It's to be expected.

21:37.664 --> 21:38.696
A king must have

21:38.698 --> 21:40.798
Power and control.

21:40.800 --> 21:41.866
It's part of his job.

21:41.868 --> 21:43.701
But...

21:43.703 --> 21:47.805
Even the biggest of
jobs can become so dull.

21:47.807 --> 21:50.808
Here.

21:52.811 --> 21:53.811
(quietly laughs)

21:53.813 --> 21:55.680
It's just you and me.

21:55.682 --> 21:57.882
I'll take control.

21:57.884 --> 22:00.051
I can give you the pleasure
you offer others.

22:02.354 --> 22:05.489
I have always been
on the giving end.

22:05.491 --> 22:07.325
How tiring for you.

22:10.762 --> 22:12.763
Poor king henry.

22:12.765 --> 22:15.833

22:21.506 --> 22:22.807

Hmm?

22:22.809 --> 22:24.642

22:24.644 --> 22:26.077
Oh, I like this.

22:26.079 --> 22:27.545
Shh.

22:27.547 --> 22:29.680
Bad king.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.582
You won't speak again
unless spoken to.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.384
Do you understand?

22:39.791 --> 22:41.926
(grunts)

22:41.928 --> 22:43.394
Split up and
search the area.

22:43.396 --> 22:44.662
Yes, my lord.

22:44.664 --> 22:46.530
The cave
must be close by.

22:46.532 --> 22:48.132
Yes, my lord.
Yes, sir.

22:49.534 --> 22:51.102
This way.

22:51.104 --> 22:55.005
Bash, you come with me.

22:55.007 --> 22:57.074
We'll go on foot from here.

22:58.944 --> 23:01.412
You didn't give
me a weapon.

23:01.414 --> 23:03.047
Are you planning to have
them kill me, brother?

23:03.049 --> 23:07.017
You there, go with the others.

23:09.488 --> 23:12.089
You have made so many enemies;
why fixate on me?

23:12.091 --> 23:14.091
You reached for the
throne and failed,

23:14.093 --> 23:16.460
Nobles everywhere
despise you.

23:16.462 --> 23:18.596
Maybe it's easier
to make me the villain,

23:18.598 --> 23:20.598
So you have a reason to hate me

23:20.600 --> 23:22.032
And an excuse
to go after my wife.

23:22.034 --> 23:23.634
Listen to you.

23:23.636 --> 23:26.070
You have mary and the crown

23:26.072 --> 23:28.139
And all of France puckering
its lips to your ass,

23:28.141 --> 23:30.941
And still you're threatened
by a bastard in exile.

23:30.943 --> 23:32.576
I used to look
up to you.

23:32.578 --> 23:35.112
You were the one person
that I could rely on.

23:35.114 --> 23:36.881
But I was
wrong. You are

23:36.883 --> 23:38.783
A traitor and a usurper.

23:38.785 --> 23:41.485
Well, go ahead, do it then.

23:41.487 --> 23:43.087
Kill me.

23:43.089 --> 23:45.156
Bash.

23:49.161 --> 23:50.828
Bash:
Fresh tracks.

23:50.830 --> 23:53.130
We're not alone.

24:06.845 --> 24:09.847
I don't see henry. Did you
manage to fulfill my request?

24:11.516 --> 24:12.983
The aphrodisiac.

24:12.985 --> 24:15.920
(chuckles) you needn't
worry about that.

24:15.922 --> 24:19.123
He, uh, doesn't need
an aphrodisiac.

24:19.125 --> 24:20.991
The king...

24:20.993 --> 24:23.027
Goes a little bit mad
sometimes, doesn't he?

24:23.029 --> 24:25.062
And, uh...

24:25.064 --> 24:27.832
This is his medicine?

24:29.634 --> 24:31.802
You are a clever girl,
aren't you?

24:31.804 --> 24:34.772
(soft laugh) I'll
see that it's done.

24:34.774 --> 24:36.640
I know how to handle him.

24:36.642 --> 24:38.209
Hmm. Do you?
(short chuckle)

24:38.211 --> 24:39.477
(laughter)

24:39.479 --> 24:40.478
Oh.

Um...

24:44.150 --> 24:45.783
Uh, would you mind?

24:45.785 --> 24:46.784
Come again?

24:46.786 --> 24:48.552
My throne?

24:51.656 --> 24:52.923
Of course.

24:52.925 --> 24:55.226
Enjoy it, my dear.
(short chuckle)

24:59.197 --> 25:02.566
You stupid kitchen whore.

25:06.238 --> 25:08.739
Lola, the party's
starting.

25:08.741 --> 25:10.207
Why aren't you ready?
What's wrong?

25:10.209 --> 25:12.142
I can't fit
in my dress.

25:12.144 --> 25:14.111
Mary, we're out of time.

25:14.113 --> 25:16.280
Lola, we said we would
help each other,

25:16.282 --> 25:17.615
And we already have.

25:17.617 --> 25:20.784
What do you mean?

25:20.786 --> 25:22.520
Marry lord julien.

25:22.522 --> 25:24.188
What?
He came to France

25:24.190 --> 25:25.723
Looking to make
a good marriage.

25:25.725 --> 25:27.525
You offer him everything
he's looking for.

25:27.527 --> 25:29.527
What about greer?

25:29.529 --> 25:32.630
It was greer's idea. She
wants to help you move forward.

25:32.632 --> 25:33.831
Julien spurned her,

25:33.833 --> 25:35.666
Although she says
he did it kindly.

25:35.668 --> 25:37.067
It isn't fair.

25:37.069 --> 25:39.537
Greer is punished
and scorned

25:39.539 --> 25:41.939
While I'm rewarded.

25:41.941 --> 25:44.308
Lola. I don't
mean to sound blunt

25:44.310 --> 25:46.610
Or selfish, but
I need this to work.

25:48.280 --> 25:51.181
My marriage is threatened
from all sides.

25:51.183 --> 25:54.118
Bash's return
has francis poisoned

25:54.120 --> 25:55.653
By jealousy and mistrust.

25:55.655 --> 25:57.254
We can never be happy
while he's here.

25:57.256 --> 25:58.856
And you, you're pregnant

25:58.858 --> 26:00.057
With my husband's child,

26:00.059 --> 26:01.258
And if francis finds out...

26:01.260 --> 26:02.793
I understand.

26:02.795 --> 26:05.095
And I never want
to be a threat

26:05.097 --> 26:07.164
To your happiness.

26:08.833 --> 26:13.070
If you can help sway
lord julien in my direction,

26:13.072 --> 26:15.272
I will do my very best
to marry him.

26:15.274 --> 26:17.141
And quickly.

26:23.982 --> 26:27.151
(horse neighs)

26:27.153 --> 26:29.887
What's spooked him?

26:38.096 --> 26:39.830
(wild, whistling shriek)

26:39.832 --> 26:41.265
What was that?

26:41.267 --> 26:42.700
Bash:
I've heard that whistle before.

26:42.702 --> 26:44.001
It's the darkness.

26:44.003 --> 26:45.302
Guards.

26:45.304 --> 26:47.371
My lord?

26:47.373 --> 26:48.739
Do you see anyone?

26:48.741 --> 26:49.907

the cave.

26:55.780 --> 26:58.315

26:59.985 --> 27:02.386
What do you mean?
How is that possible?

27:02.388 --> 27:04.021
Wait, there's something here.

30:47.545 --> 30:49.546
Thank you.

30:49.548 --> 30:52.049
Likewise.

31:11.637 --> 31:13.337
I'm feeling better.

31:13.339 --> 31:15.939
Perhaps it is time
to rejoin society,

31:15.941 --> 31:17.941
As you said.

31:17.943 --> 31:20.043
Come.

31:20.045 --> 31:22.045
Dance with me.

31:22.047 --> 31:23.914
I'm sorry.

31:25.617 --> 31:27.985
I can't.

31:34.259 --> 31:36.894
How are you feeling?

31:36.896 --> 31:38.462
Is the chill
still with you?

31:38.464 --> 31:40.163
I feel lucky to be alive.

31:41.966 --> 31:44.067
(sighs)

31:44.069 --> 31:46.403
I would have died
under that ice.

31:46.405 --> 31:48.939
You saved my life.

31:48.941 --> 31:52.442
Was that wise since you
believe I tried to kill you?

31:52.444 --> 31:54.278
I did believe that,
didn't I?

31:54.280 --> 31:57.481
Then why risk
your life for mine?

31:57.483 --> 32:00.150
You're my brother.

32:01.686 --> 32:04.554
Have you sent word to
mary that we're back?

32:04.556 --> 32:06.156
Just now.

32:06.158 --> 32:08.592
I spoke with the guards.

32:08.594 --> 32:10.427
They found the cave,
but it was empty.

32:10.429 --> 32:11.695
There was nothing
in there but blood.

32:11.697 --> 32:16.199
Evidence of grave suffering,
but no monster.

32:16.201 --> 32:18.568
If olivia got away, he
surely knew we'd be coming.

32:18.570 --> 32:20.971
Maybe that's why
he left rowan's hand.

32:20.973 --> 32:23.640
To draw us out onto the ice.

32:23.642 --> 32:26.176
I'll find him.

32:26.178 --> 32:29.446
I'll see him dead for rowan
and for all his victims.

32:29.448 --> 32:32.182
I promise you.

32:32.184 --> 32:33.984
You can go,
assured of that.

32:33.986 --> 32:38.488
You deserve your own
life far away from here.

32:38.490 --> 32:41.191
Maybe finally I can find
something that's...

32:41.193 --> 32:43.527
My own.

32:43.529 --> 32:46.463
You will.

32:47.532 --> 32:49.599
You'll still be my brother.

32:50.401 --> 32:53.470
Francis?

32:55.406 --> 32:58.275
Why did you release
sebastian from the dungeon?

32:58.277 --> 32:59.743
I just needed his help.

32:59.745 --> 33:02.279
Well, now
that he's here,

33:02.281 --> 33:05.148
We need to finish this
once and for all.

33:05.150 --> 33:06.483
Finish what?

33:06.485 --> 33:08.185
Bash, when I told you

33:08.187 --> 33:12.289
To forget about mary,
I hoped you would listen to me.

33:12.291 --> 33:14.458
When I forced you
to watch their consummation,

33:14.460 --> 33:16.360
My message was the same, but

33:16.362 --> 33:20.030
When I looked into your eyes
that night, I saw the truth.

33:20.032 --> 33:23.633
You will always covet
what your brother has.

33:27.105 --> 33:31.074
Father, did you speak to my
guards the night that bash left?

33:31.076 --> 33:34.244
Did you order his execution?

33:34.246 --> 33:36.313
Sacrifices must be made.

33:37.582 --> 33:39.716
What has happened to you,
father? Have you lost all sense?

33:39.718 --> 33:42.185
Do not question me!
Mark my words, he would

33:42.187 --> 33:43.453
Strike you down
to take what is yours.

33:43.455 --> 33:44.721
If he is a threat to you,

33:44.723 --> 33:46.189
Then he is
a threat to everything I want.

33:46.191 --> 33:48.091
Francis:
He's your son.
Scotland, England,

33:48.093 --> 33:49.493
A peaceful France.

33:49.495 --> 33:51.395
Father, stop this!
Father...

33:51.397 --> 33:53.597
He's leaving!
He's leaving for Spain tonight.

33:53.599 --> 33:56.199
He's said that before,
and he's still here.

33:56.201 --> 33:58.735
You refuse to let mary go.

33:58.737 --> 34:00.470
You haven't listened
to your king.

34:00.472 --> 34:02.472
When people don't listen
to their king,

34:02.474 --> 34:04.274
When they've wax in their ears,

34:04.276 --> 34:06.376
Drastic measures
are needed.

34:06.378 --> 34:07.711
Father, you're wrong.

34:07.713 --> 34:10.213
He has let her go.
He saved my life today.

34:10.215 --> 34:12.449
Don't get sentimental.

34:12.451 --> 34:15.585
You must cut down any threat...

34:15.587 --> 34:17.154
Like a weed.

34:17.156 --> 34:19.256
No. I've just
explained to you.

34:19.258 --> 34:22.392
Your son is a friend
to your realm.

34:22.394 --> 34:24.428
Bash:
Francis, don't
anger him.

34:24.430 --> 34:26.463
Francis:
He saved your heir's life,
and pursued your enemies.

34:26.465 --> 34:30.267
If you harm this man...
Your son,

34:30.269 --> 34:32.803
You harm yourself.

34:32.805 --> 34:35.439
Do you hear me?

34:37.175 --> 34:39.543
(gasps)

34:49.420 --> 34:52.222
I am pleased to see
you two getting along again.

34:52.224 --> 34:54.291
(panting)

34:54.293 --> 34:58.562
I know just the thing
to preserve this lovely harmony.

35:01.732 --> 35:04.501
If it doesn't work,

35:04.503 --> 35:07.504
This sword will take
two lives tonight.

35:18.516 --> 35:21.818
(loon calling)

35:21.820 --> 35:24.454
(footfalls approaching)

35:28.726 --> 35:31.361
(loon calling)

35:34.265 --> 35:36.700
The last person I danced with...

35:36.702 --> 35:39.202
Was my wife.

35:39.204 --> 35:42.172
I was married once.

35:42.174 --> 35:45.175
I had... Little children,

35:45.177 --> 35:48.178
So young, so sweet.

35:48.180 --> 35:50.547
In the mornings
when-when I wake up,

35:50.549 --> 35:52.749
Sometimes I'm-I'm
still there,

35:52.751 --> 35:55.852
Lying in that bed...

35:55.854 --> 35:58.321
With my wife beside me,

35:58.323 --> 36:02.659
The little ones
whispering, laughing.

36:04.862 --> 36:07.364
When the plague came,

36:07.366 --> 36:10.534
I alone was immune.

36:12.436 --> 36:14.804
I couldn't save them.

36:17.708 --> 36:20.243
I'm so sorry.

36:20.245 --> 36:22.646
This is why you dedicate
yourself to your work?

Well, penelope,

37:29.748 --> 37:31.881
I must say, I'm impressed.

37:33.017 --> 37:34.818
Ah, there she is,

37:34.820 --> 37:38.321
My lovely queen.

37:42.893 --> 37:44.427
(moaning)

37:44.429 --> 37:45.929
Now, catherine,

37:45.931 --> 37:47.564
Penelope tells
me you demanded

37:47.566 --> 37:49.532
She pour that vial
into my wine.

37:49.534 --> 37:52.402
She threatened my life if
I failed to give it to you.

37:52.404 --> 37:53.637
I did no such thing.

37:53.639 --> 37:55.505
Are you calling my queen a liar?

37:55.507 --> 37:56.840
(laughing):
This is nonsense.

37:56.842 --> 37:58.508
She's a servant girl.

37:58.510 --> 38:00.443
You're not well.

38:00.445 --> 38:01.911
She's taking advantage.

38:01.913 --> 38:04.314
I have never felt
better in my life.

38:04.316 --> 38:06.583
I'm in love, catherine.

38:06.585 --> 38:07.884
I'm in love with queen penelope.

38:07.886 --> 38:10.587
Hmm. She's not a queen!

38:10.589 --> 38:13.723
She didn't even win
that ridiculous contest.

38:13.725 --> 38:15.058
In the kitchen,
they say that she slept

38:15.060 --> 38:17.460
With the pastry chef
to get the bean.

38:17.462 --> 38:19.996
Penelope, my crown. Now.

38:19.998 --> 38:21.731
(laughs)
give it to me.

38:21.733 --> 38:24.768
Listen. Carefully.

38:24.770 --> 38:26.636
If you utter one more
insult to my queen,

38:26.638 --> 38:28.538
If you try to harm
her in any way,

38:28.540 --> 38:30.407
I will have you
drawn and quartered

38:30.409 --> 38:31.808
And your limbs
fed to lions.

38:31.810 --> 38:37.747
And those you love
shall suffer worse fates.

38:37.749 --> 38:39.749
(gasping)
(laughing)

38:39.751 --> 38:41.818
Penelope (echoing):
It was poison, wasn't it?

38:41.820 --> 38:43.053
What?

38:43.055 --> 38:44.754
What are you talking about?

38:44.756 --> 38:46.890
(echoing):
I wanted to teach you a lesson.

38:46.892 --> 38:51.027
So I had the contents of that
vial emptied into your wine.

38:51.029 --> 38:52.495
You don't look

38:52.497 --> 38:53.630
Well, darling.

38:53.632 --> 38:54.531
Henry.

38:54.533 --> 38:56.966
(sighs)

38:56.968 --> 38:59.369
Penelope:
I wanted to thank
you, catherine,

38:59.371 --> 39:02.105
For teaching me
to think long-term.

39:04.408 --> 39:05.809
(mutters)

39:05.811 --> 39:08.745
(gasping)

39:08.747 --> 39:10.513
(panting)

39:10.515 --> 39:12.782
Oh, mary.
What's happened?
Are you all right?

39:12.784 --> 39:14.818
Mary, find nostradamus.
Henry's drugged me.

39:14.820 --> 39:16.453
(gasps)

39:16.455 --> 39:18.788
Catherine? Catherine!

39:18.790 --> 39:20.990
Guards! (sighs)

39:20.992 --> 39:23.026
How is she?

39:23.028 --> 39:24.728
Nostradamus is
treating her now.

39:24.730 --> 39:26.596
She fell into

39:26.598 --> 39:28.898
Some sort of drugged sleep,
but she's coming out of it.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.500
I'm going to talk to my father.

39:30.502 --> 39:32.669
Francis, wait.
Your father--

39:32.671 --> 39:34.804
He's not well.
I am aware of that.

39:34.806 --> 39:38.108
He got so angry at bash that I
thought he'd take his head off.

39:38.110 --> 39:39.476
He might kill him yet.

39:41.045 --> 39:43.012
What happened?

39:43.014 --> 39:44.781
Did father forgive you?

39:44.783 --> 39:46.049
Bash:
Not exactly.

39:46.051 --> 39:48.985
But he illuminated me
on his solution.

39:48.987 --> 39:50.787
It's a bit of a
horror show, actually.

39:50.789 --> 39:52.989
And you're both
invited. Now.

39:52.991 --> 39:55.091
On pain of death.

39:55.093 --> 39:57.994
Man:
<i>And so,</i>

39:57.996 --> 40:00.397
Under the eyes of the lord,

40:00.399 --> 40:03.600
We prepare to consecrate
this blessed union

40:03.602 --> 40:05.034
With two sacred oaths.

40:05.036 --> 40:06.836
Kenna:
You want me

40:06.838 --> 40:08.571
To say an oath?
What about your oath?

40:08.573 --> 40:10.974
You promised me someone
with a title!

40:10.976 --> 40:12.709
Henry:
Fine. Bash,

40:12.711 --> 40:14.644
I hereby declare you...

40:14.646 --> 40:16.980
The master of horse and hunt.

40:16.982 --> 40:18.715
What does that even mean?!

40:18.717 --> 40:19.783
Shut up and say the words.

40:19.785 --> 40:21.518
Kenna:
Please.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.086
This is marriage.
It can't be undone...

40:23.088 --> 40:25.655
Say the words!

40:28.092 --> 40:29.859
I, sebastian,

40:29.861 --> 40:32.662
Take this woman
to be my lawful wife...
(kenna cries)

40:32.664 --> 40:37.667
...Under the eyes of god,
from this day forward.

40:42.106 --> 40:45.508
Take a dozen men each morning
and canvass the woods.

40:45.510 --> 40:47.477
Any pagan found
with knowledge of

40:47.479 --> 40:49.813
The darkness will be brought
to me for questioning.

40:49.815 --> 40:52.482
I don't take orders
from bastards.
Haven't you heard?

40:52.484 --> 40:54.984
I've been titled
master of horse and hunt. So,

40:54.986 --> 40:58.021
Gather your horses
and go out and hunt.

40:59.490 --> 41:01.891
(sighs)

41:06.063 --> 41:08.765
Are you all right?

41:08.767 --> 41:11.901
Well, I'm married to someone

41:11.903 --> 41:14.137
I don't much like.

41:14.139 --> 41:16.473
And I have to stay here

41:16.475 --> 41:19.042
And watch you love someone else
for the rest of my life.

41:19.044 --> 41:22.946
Bash, you told me that
your feelings for me were gone.

41:22.948 --> 41:25.782
I lied.

41:25.784 --> 41:28.818
You were right.
I should never have come back.
