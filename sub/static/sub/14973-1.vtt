So if the R.O.V.
follows the ridge here,

        Besides, with
     the storm coming in,

11:28.488 --> 11:31.389
           gives us a chance to
       get some fresh air while
        we still can, you know?

   You guys should
   take a look at this.

11:34.661 --> 11:39.364
        We are seeing
  a lot of under-ice melting
  from these warm currents.

11:39.466 --> 11:40.799
      That makes sense,
      with the readings
