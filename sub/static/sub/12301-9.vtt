WEBVTT

00:19.043 --> 00:21.049
All right, men, knows
the notches in it as mine.

00:21.049 --> 00:24.029
- Right.
- All the fish will kiss up this time.

00:25.148 --> 00:28.208
Whoa! Oh, that smell is foul, man.
What do you got in there, bro?

00:28.208 --> 00:29.231
My secret weapon.

00:29.231 --> 00:31.024
Guaranteed to get the
broadbills jumping.

00:31.024 --> 00:32.952
Okay, so you changed bait, huh?

00:32.952 --> 00:34.078
All right, give it up.
What is it?

00:34.078 --> 00:35.478
If I did that, it wouldn't
be a secret now, would it?

00:35.478 --> 00:37.330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:38.518 --> 00:39.471
Hey, look. hey.

00:39.471 --> 00:40.873
check it out, man.

00:42.169 --> 00:44.494
What kind of bait you
use for that, huh?

00:44.825 --> 00:46.567
Hey, is she okay?

00:46.762 --> 00:48.842
Oh, my god, look!

00:48.842 --> 00:51.746
- Shark!
- Lady, wake up!

00:52.372 --> 00:55.531
- Come on, get out of there!
- Come onto the dock.

00:55.916 --> 00:57.470
Shark!

00:57.470 --> 00:59.502
Swim! / Get out of there!
Shark! / Swim! Swim!

00:59.502 --> 01:00.934
Get out of there!

01:01.411 --> 01:03.127
Hey, gus, call somebody!

01:03.127 --> 01:04.328
Help!

01:10.217 --> 01:11.852
She's gone. where'd she go?
Where'd she go?

01:21.637 --> 01:23.925
Oh, my god!

01:36.196 --> 01:38.650
Coast guard fished her
out half an hour ago.

01:38.725 --> 01:41.081
Well, at least what's left of her.

01:42.296 --> 01:44.493
Shark attack inside the marina?

01:44.493 --> 01:46.782
A couple of eyewitnesses
saw a dorsal fin.

01:46.782 --> 01:48.107
Little reminder

01:48.107 --> 01:50.330
we're all just part of the food chain.

01:51.609 --> 01:53.173
Quick look, Alexx.

01:53.436 --> 01:55.682
Shark took a chunk out of her.

01:55.682 --> 01:58.299
Wow. / A lot of internal damage here.

01:59.522 --> 02:01.831
She was certainly dressed to impress,

02:01.831 --> 02:04.132
but it's a little early for clubbing, isn't it?

02:04.132 --> 02:05.713
Or a late finish.

02:05.713 --> 02:08.027
Maybe knocked back
a few too many and fell in.

02:08.027 --> 02:13.016
It still doesn't explain why a shark would
be in a high-traffic area like this. Alexx,

02:13.016 --> 02:15.456
was she bleeding before the attack?

02:15.456 --> 02:18.406
Let's see...
she was bleeding, all right.

02:18.727 --> 02:20.262
Entrance wound.

02:20.262 --> 02:22.193
Shot at close range.

02:22.377 --> 02:25.067
The shark must have finished
what someone else started.

02:25.067 --> 02:27.792
So we have a different kind of shark.

02:30.931 --> 02:32.709
The human kind.

03:08.280 --> 03:11.214
MIAMI
2x09 Bait

03:25.391 --> 03:27.114
Divers are all suited up, H.

03:27.114 --> 03:28.088
You sure you don't want me
to go with them?

03:28.088 --> 03:30.274
No, I need you on dry land, Eric.

03:30.274 --> 03:31.538
Anything on the shark?

03:31.538 --> 03:35.353
Yeah, sailboat saw it out in the channel.
It's a bull shark, very aggressive.

03:35.353 --> 03:36.763
I've warned the divers to be careful.

03:36.763 --> 03:40.294
Good, maybe we have a chance
at finding the gun. Speed,

03:40.294 --> 03:43.348
I'm going to need to release
her to Alexx for an id.

03:43.348 --> 03:45.482
Well, this might give us a head start.

03:45.944 --> 03:47.375
I found this on her.

03:47.375 --> 03:51.262
It's a lavaliere microphone.
You got a transmitter.

03:51.390 --> 03:53.613
- Why would she be wearing a wire?
- I don't know.

03:53.613 --> 03:55.986
It's ultra-frequency, digital.

03:55.986 --> 03:57.740
- This is high-end spy gear.
- Okay,

03:57.740 --> 04:02.354
let's contact the FEDs,
DEA and customs, and see...

04:02.354 --> 04:06.775
if anybody is missing an agent.

04:07.822 --> 04:09.535
Hey. / Hey, Calleigh, uh...

04:09.625 --> 04:11.382
have you got the results
to miami creek double?

04:11.382 --> 04:13.303
I'm pretty backed up right now.
Horatio called.

04:13.303 --> 04:17.074
- I've got to get over to see Alexx.
- It's going to trial in two days.

04:18.045 --> 04:20.678
Frank, there are multiple
rounds in that case.

04:20.678 --> 04:24.179
You've got to call me when
you get a trial date. / I thought I did.

04:24.179 --> 04:26.217
I would have remembered,
believe me.

04:26.217 --> 04:27.763
You dropped the ball on this one.

04:27.763 --> 04:29.855
Yeah, well, things have been
a little crazy lately.

04:29.855 --> 04:32.035
I'll ask the state attorney
for a continuance.

04:32.035 --> 04:34.275
No, it's all right.
I'll get your evidence finished.

04:34.275 --> 04:35.852
Just, next time, call me.

04:35.852 --> 04:37.338
Okay, thanks.

04:40.491 --> 04:43.028
Okay.
Can you hear me now?

04:43.272 --> 04:44.285
Good.

04:48.272 --> 04:50.628
Can you hear me now?

04:50.790 --> 04:51.851
Very good.

04:51.851 --> 04:54.130
I'm going to move another 75 feet.

04:54.219 --> 04:56.208
- He's wacko.
- Thanks, ladies.

04:57.317 --> 04:59.806
I heard about our shark girl.
Is this her?

04:59.806 --> 05:01.724
Shot, then eaten.

05:01.724 --> 05:03.791
That's a bad day in
anyone's book, honey.

05:03.791 --> 05:05.450
Did you determine a cause of death?

05:05.450 --> 05:08.615
Bullet nicked the axillary artery.
She was bleeding out.

05:08.615 --> 05:10.574
So the blood drew the shark.

05:10.574 --> 05:15.381
Can you believe that as little as one part per million
can attract a shark from a quarter mile away?

05:21.981 --> 05:24.367
Can't blame the shark for this.

05:34.509 --> 05:37.023
Looks like a.380.

05:37.185 --> 05:40.640
Eight lands and grooves
with a right-hand twist.

05:40.764 --> 05:42.151
I'll run it through IBIS.

05:42.151 --> 05:44.447
You might want to check
CODIS while you're at it.

05:45.076 --> 05:47.258
You are not thinking sexual assault?

05:47.258 --> 05:50.210
The shark took a chunk out
of her. I did a kit anyway.

05:50.210 --> 05:51.709
I think there's semen.

05:51.815 --> 05:53.910
That means her bad day
just got worse.

05:55.356 --> 05:56.985
Law enforcement checks
came up empty.

05:56.985 --> 05:59.002
There was no undercover
officers or informants

05:59.002 --> 06:02.262
missing from any of the agencies
in the miami-dade area.

06:02.262 --> 06:05.991
State or federal. / So why else
would she be wearing a wire?

06:05.991 --> 06:09.041
That's what we were wondering,
so we did a little experiment.

06:09.041 --> 06:11.696
Yeah. We used Dric and
a near field strength detector.

06:11.696 --> 06:14.534
We found out this transmitter craps out
right around a hundred feet.

06:14.534 --> 06:18.602
Okay, so that means her recording
device needed to be nearby, right?

06:18.602 --> 06:20.661
Righ so if we can find her base camp,

06:20.661 --> 06:22.342
it might shed some light
on who killed her.

06:22.342 --> 06:24.800
Right. / We also checked
with the manufacturer,

06:24.800 --> 06:27.637
and they sell primarily to
government agencies.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.127
What about private buyers?

06:29.127 --> 06:31.820
Only one locally...
Bruno gomez.

06:31.820 --> 06:33.708
Owns a private investigation firm.

06:33.708 --> 06:34.965
He bought 20.

06:34.965 --> 06:36.466
Let's go talk to Bruno.

06:40.201 --> 06:42.849
Her name is Cindy castiano.
She was one of my bait girls.

06:42.849 --> 06:44.815
Would you care to explain that?

06:44.815 --> 06:47.389
Sure. Wife suspects husband's
getting some on the side,

06:47.389 --> 06:49.733
so, she gives me a call.

06:49.892 --> 06:51.517
Next time he's at his
favorite watering hole,

06:51.517 --> 06:54.088
he gets approached by
a tall hottie in a short skirt...

06:54.088 --> 06:57.749
Right, right, I get it.
cheating hearts, incorporated.

06:57.749 --> 07:00.153
I'm sure the families you break up

07:00.153 --> 07:03.122
are real appreciative
of your sense of humor.

07:03.202 --> 07:06.812
So, you tempt guys
that cheat, and then...

07:06.950 --> 07:10.624
- you punish them for being tempted.
- I just set the table, okay?

07:10.624 --> 07:13.264
They decide to eat, and guess
what, that's not my problem.

07:13.264 --> 07:17.269
Well, guess what? You got a dead girl
on your hands, so it is your problem.

07:18.711 --> 07:20.496
So, did she have any enemies?

07:20.496 --> 07:21.935
Are you kidding?

07:21.935 --> 07:23.469
This is the enemy business, dude.

07:23.469 --> 07:27.211
She probably had about a dozen TROs
against marks in the last 18 months.

07:27.211 --> 07:30.822
- Temporary restraining orders?
- Yes. She pissed off a lot of guys.

07:30.943 --> 07:32.097
That's why she was
so damn good and

07:32.097 --> 07:33.902
that is why it's going to be
very hard to replace her.

07:33.902 --> 07:37.932
Yeah, you seem real broken up
about the whole thing.

07:38.723 --> 07:40.541
What was the last case
that she was working on?

07:40.541 --> 07:43.994
You know what, Jack? I'm sorry,
but that's information I can't reveal.

07:43.994 --> 07:46.496
- You know, privacy issues.
- There's nothing private about murder,

07:46.496 --> 07:48.984
so I'm going to need
your whole clientele list.

07:48.984 --> 07:51.499
Come on, I can't have cops showing
up at my clients' doors, okay?

07:51.499 --> 07:52.965
That's bad for business.

07:52.965 --> 07:55.237
- I can get a warrant, Jack.
- Well, then do it, man.

07:55.237 --> 07:58.080
Because at least I can tell them
that you're twisting my arm, all right?

07:58.080 --> 08:00.982
I mean, I got a reputation to protect.

08:01.448 --> 08:03.278
Well, good luck with that.

08:03.278 --> 08:04.574
Yeah, that's cute.

08:09.446 --> 08:10.946
Horatio. What have you got?

08:10.946 --> 08:12.567
I'm at the hotel lapidus.

08:12.567 --> 08:17.508
Security guard here found our victim's
car vandalized and her id is inside it.

08:17.508 --> 08:20.062
Okay. Is she a guest at the hotel?

08:20.062 --> 08:22.292
If she was, she's self-parked.

08:22.292 --> 08:25.166
Didn't register under her
own name either. / Hey.

08:25.166 --> 08:26.593
All right.

08:26.593 --> 08:30.431
Wait a second. Is there a bar
on the roof of the hotel lapidus?

08:30.431 --> 08:32.780
Yeah. / Wait. don't go.

08:32.780 --> 08:37.081
Good. Let's see if anybody inquired
about the room directly below the bar.

08:37.081 --> 08:38.597
Okay, within 100 feet.

08:38.597 --> 08:42.119
Within range of the wire that
our victim is wearing, okay?

08:42.119 --> 08:44.816
Okay, I've got it.
I'm on it, H.

08:45.457 --> 08:47.640
Sorry, I was trying to hear Horatio.
What's up?

08:47.753 --> 08:49.099
What, it's no big deal.

08:49.099 --> 08:50.957
I just have a timeline.

08:51.692 --> 08:53.193
Okay. / It's primer paint.

08:53.193 --> 08:55.593
It takes three to four hours
to dry in the humidity,

08:55.593 --> 08:58.589
sometimes longer, which means
somebody knew she was going to be here.

08:58.589 --> 09:01.108
And, also, there's a print.

09:01.108 --> 09:03.328
Well, actually, it's a partial.

09:03.328 --> 09:07.099
So, I'll run it against shark girl's TROs
and see if any arrests pop up.

09:07.390 --> 09:09.494
Okay, we've got a hotel
room to check out.

09:09.494 --> 09:10.668
Mm-hmm.

09:10.668 --> 09:11.934
See ya.

09:12.101 --> 09:13.241
Good work.

09:34.764 --> 09:38.152
Did we get anything off
Cindy castiano's TRO list?

09:38.152 --> 09:41.640
The fingerprint Calleigh
found in the primer paint

09:41.640 --> 09:43.506
belongs to one Carl purdue.

09:43.506 --> 09:46.303
Recently divorced and very active.

09:46.303 --> 09:48.349
So, he violated his restraining order.

09:48.349 --> 09:50.311
Twice in the past three months.

09:50.311 --> 09:52.508
Arrested for vandalism

09:52.508 --> 09:54.275
and terrorist threats against her.

09:54.275 --> 09:55.888
What kind of threats?

09:55.888 --> 09:57.988
He said he was going to kill her.

09:58.666 --> 10:00.915
I didn't mean any of that.
I was kidding around.

10:00.915 --> 10:02.835
That doesn't matter, Mr. Purdue.

10:02.835 --> 10:05.501
Just making the threat
is against the law.

10:05.795 --> 10:08.464
I'd never really kill anyone.
That's crazy.

10:08.464 --> 10:10.801
Yes, but taking a baseball
bat to somebody's car,

10:10.801 --> 10:13.121
that's okay with you, right?

10:13.347 --> 10:14.657
I don't know what you're talking about.

10:14.657 --> 10:19.517
You vandalized Cindy castiano's car
the day somebody killed her.

10:21.089 --> 10:23.575
Okay, maybe I did her car,
but that's all.

10:23.575 --> 10:27.279
Her sexual assault kit came
back positive for semen.

10:28.449 --> 10:30.696
She just got what she deserved.

10:31.694 --> 10:33.539
How's that, Carl?

10:35.200 --> 10:38.637
- She ruined my life.
- All you had to do was say no.

10:38.637 --> 10:40.822
She made it impossible.

10:41.078 --> 10:44.781
The way she looked,
the way she moved.

10:45.013 --> 10:48.769
She took my job away, took my family.
That bitch left me with nothing.

10:48.769 --> 10:52.682
She left you with a motive to kill her.

11:03.455 --> 11:04.426
Wow.

11:04.426 --> 11:07.187
This looks like Johnny depp
just checked out.

11:08.111 --> 11:11.500
The hotel clerk said a single woman
checked in yesterday,

11:11.500 --> 11:16.390
requested this room specifically,
and asked not to be disturbed.

11:16.390 --> 11:19.688
Well, it looks like she got
more than a disturbance.

11:25.959 --> 11:28.935
We've got gravitational droplets...

11:29.071 --> 11:31.245
and a palm smear.

11:31.300 --> 11:33.268
So, she fell right here.

11:35.333 --> 11:38.025
I think we just found our
primary crime scene.

11:38.206 --> 11:39.479
I think so.

12:11.990 --> 12:14.677
Found ourselves a tape recorder.

12:17.608 --> 12:19.528
This could have the murder on it.

12:30.793 --> 12:33.693
Got fingerprints all over the room
service. What have you got?

12:33.693 --> 12:38.145
Well, the killer took all of his surveillance
reels, but forgot to take all the tape.

12:38.145 --> 12:39.984
That's great.
That can give us a motive.

12:39.984 --> 12:41.868
It might give us his voice.

12:44.482 --> 12:45.753
Did you get something for me?

12:45.753 --> 12:48.746
Carl purdue's DNA results.

12:48.902 --> 12:50.486
There's no match

12:50.486 --> 12:53.041
on the semen sample
that we took off the body,

12:53.041 --> 12:55.385
and his alibi checked out.

12:55.385 --> 12:58.424
He was working night shift
at miami international airport.

12:58.424 --> 13:02.701
I guess the best we can hook him
up for is vandalizing the car.

13:03.842 --> 13:06.164
Do you want us to check
Cindy's TRO results again?

13:06.164 --> 13:09.144
I don't think so.
These TRO guys are vandals.

13:09.144 --> 13:13.476
They intruded on cindy's life,
to get some control back, but the killer,

13:13.476 --> 13:16.440
the killer shot her and
made sure she died,

13:16.440 --> 13:18.349
so he's drinking from a different well.

13:18.349 --> 13:21.292
So we need to check to find out
who's not on the list.

13:21.292 --> 13:24.543
Okay, I need cheating hearts'
client records for that.

13:24.543 --> 13:27.897
The warrant has been served and
the client list is on the way over.

13:27.897 --> 13:29.875
Do me a favor. Let me know when
it gets here, all right?

13:29.875 --> 13:31.316
Great, I will.

13:31.316 --> 13:32.565
Thank you.

13:33.426 --> 13:36.563
So, you're a married man,
sitting alone in a bar, having a drink,

13:36.563 --> 13:40.108
and a beautiful woman half your age
starts hitting on you.

13:40.108 --> 13:42.328
What's the first thing you think?

13:42.590 --> 13:44.137
How much?

13:44.137 --> 13:45.832
Smart man.

13:45.988 --> 13:48.615
Let's say she's not talking fee
after the first 30 seconds.

13:48.615 --> 13:51.250
I mean, a bell doesn't go off?

13:51.250 --> 13:53.243
I'd put my drink down and go home

13:53.243 --> 13:56.415
'cause something is going down
and it could be me.

13:56.415 --> 13:58.616
some guys just don't get it.

13:58.813 --> 14:01.548
Hey, Delko. / But maybe that's why
they're alone in the bar in the first place.

14:01.548 --> 14:03.635
They're just not getting it, you know?

14:04.478 --> 14:06.231
You better look at this.

14:06.894 --> 14:08.659
What's up? you got a match?

14:08.804 --> 14:10.105
Yeah.

14:12.638 --> 14:14.709
One of our detectives.

14:16.167 --> 14:17.730
Frank tripp?
No, that can't be right.

14:17.730 --> 14:19.709
I was hoping there'd be two of them,

14:19.709 --> 14:22.180
so I double-checked it against
the department database.

14:22.180 --> 14:25.983
Minutiae patterns are
the same, multiple points.

14:26.784 --> 14:28.735
It's not a mistake.

14:28.925 --> 14:30.184
Which print?

14:30.184 --> 14:32.779
The one lifted off the
victim's hotel key card.

14:32.779 --> 14:35.106
What about the other
prints we collected?

14:38.434 --> 14:40.926
No match.
Different suspect.

14:41.014 --> 14:42.888
Sorry, man.

14:43.327 --> 14:44.838
All right.

14:45.071 --> 14:47.661
Look, you didn't see this.

14:47.838 --> 14:50.272
You didn't see this, okay?

14:50.272 --> 14:52.548
Listen, I'm not offering anything up...

14:52.972 --> 14:55.178
but I'm not lying either.

14:56.455 --> 14:58.584
All right, that's fair.

15:16.756 --> 15:18.281
Hey, Frank.

15:18.425 --> 15:19.681
Hey.

15:19.681 --> 15:20.959
You got a minute?

15:20.959 --> 15:22.412
Uh, yeah, yeah.

15:22.412 --> 15:24.637
Just some days, this
freakin' job, you know?

15:24.637 --> 15:25.988
Yeah.

15:25.988 --> 15:28.900
Listen, I just need you to
clear something up for me.

15:29.586 --> 15:31.314
What is it?

15:31.495 --> 15:32.957
I, uh...

15:33.404 --> 15:35.531
I don't think I want to do this here.

15:36.032 --> 15:38.683
How about you just tell me
what it is that's bugging you?

15:42.805 --> 15:45.676
You know that girl we fished out
of the marina yesterday?

15:45.676 --> 15:47.736
Yeah, the shark vic? / Yeah.
What about her?

15:47.736 --> 15:50.749
She worked for one of
those detective agencies.

15:50.749 --> 15:54.816
The ones that catch guys that might be
cheating on their wives or girlfriends.

15:55.026 --> 15:57.719
Turns out she was shot in her
room at the hotel lapidus

15:57.719 --> 15:59.923
before she went in the water.

16:01.891 --> 16:04.391
This going somewhere, Delko?

16:06.656 --> 16:10.647
I... I found your print
on her room key card.

16:10.909 --> 16:13.822
You've got to be kidding me.

16:18.219 --> 16:19.607
You think I'm involved in this?

16:19.607 --> 16:22.997
No, I don't, but, uh,

16:23.394 --> 16:26.014
I just matched your print.
I'm coming straight to you.

16:26.014 --> 16:27.701
Okay, I haven't told anyone
or gone anywhere.

16:27.701 --> 16:30.965
I just need you to tell me
how it got there.

16:33.718 --> 16:35.293
All right.

16:35.293 --> 16:37.844
I went to the bar for a drink after work.

16:39.519 --> 16:42.620
The girl was there.
She dropped the card on the floor.

16:43.105 --> 16:45.309
I picked it up...

16:45.309 --> 16:47.008
handed it back to her.

16:47.008 --> 16:49.688
That's it. End of story.

16:53.534 --> 16:55.415
That's it.

16:57.419 --> 16:59.025
Okay.

17:00.068 --> 17:02.117
All right.

17:05.970 --> 17:11.165
The tape must've got stretched when
the reels were taken off the machine.

17:11.165 --> 17:13.130
We can still use it, right?

17:13.130 --> 17:15.753
It's pretty chewed up,

17:15.753 --> 17:20.603
but let me see what I can do.
One pass, it's recorded on the hard drive.

17:28.746 --> 17:33.109
it's going to be distorted and a little
slower, because it's stretched.

17:35.719 --> 17:39.486
Filter out distortion, maintain pitch,

17:39.486 --> 17:42.892
- adjust compression.
- Please...

17:45.782 --> 17:47.481
please, something, something.

17:47.481 --> 17:50.030
Please, don't...
the rest is anybody's guess.

17:50.030 --> 17:55.028
I can run a phonetic matching program,
but it's going to take a while.

17:55.660 --> 18:00.273
I don't think we're going to get anything off
of this except our victim's last words.

18:01.178 --> 18:03.621
Tyler, maybe you want to
go get a cup of coffee.

18:03.621 --> 18:06.022
That's okay. I'm cool.

18:12.053 --> 18:15.178
Yeah, uh,
I'll get a cup of coffee.

18:15.178 --> 18:17.641
Thanks.

18:18.748 --> 18:20.807
What's up?

18:21.507 --> 18:25.083
What would you do if someone you
knew was involved in this?

18:25.774 --> 18:27.417
How involved?

18:27.417 --> 18:30.315
Fingerprint evidence puts
them at the scene.

18:31.702 --> 18:33.446
is it a cop?

18:33.932 --> 18:35.453
Yeah.

18:36.431 --> 18:38.139
Did you talk to the cop about it?

18:38.139 --> 18:39.893
It's not Hagen.

18:39.893 --> 18:42.689
This cop admits he was there,
but that's all,

18:42.689 --> 18:44.709
and I'm pretty sure he's lying.

18:44.709 --> 18:46.414
Well, what do you think?
You think he did it?

18:46.414 --> 18:47.940
No. No.

18:48.360 --> 18:50.404
No, no way.

18:50.573 --> 18:51.680
Well,

18:51.680 --> 18:54.848
if you tell Horatio and
he turns out to be clean,

18:54.848 --> 18:57.449
no cop in miami is ever
going to trust you again.

18:57.449 --> 18:58.979
I know.

18:59.424 --> 19:01.455
I have cheating hearts' client records.

19:01.455 --> 19:03.076
I haven't looked at it.

19:16.457 --> 19:20.531
Our victim tested positive for semen.
You're going to need a swab.

19:25.480 --> 19:27.087
Hey, Eric?

19:28.470 --> 19:30.864
Don't wait too long to tell Horatio.

19:45.955 --> 19:49.309
Last guy got in my car uninvited
ended up in the hospital.

19:49.698 --> 19:51.701
I think you should see this.

19:59.869 --> 20:01.693
Just so you know,

20:01.693 --> 20:03.334
I haven't told anyone.

20:07.103 --> 20:09.257
Am I a suspect? / No,
not as far as I'm concerned.

20:09.257 --> 20:11.814
So, you just came out here to tell me

20:11.814 --> 20:13.641
that my wife thinks I'm screwing
around on her, is that it?

20:13.641 --> 20:15.724
I just need to exclude
you, Frank, okay?

20:15.724 --> 20:18.721
- The rest is none of my business.
- Damn right it's not.

20:21.908 --> 20:23.423
Okay.

20:23.936 --> 20:25.830
I spent some time with her at the bar.

20:25.975 --> 20:27.442
You happy?

20:28.323 --> 20:30.321
First, I thought she was a hooker.

20:30.560 --> 20:32.703
Then I figured she was just
out having some fun.

20:38.103 --> 20:40.124
Staying here at the hotel?

20:41.242 --> 20:43.324
Uh... no.

20:45.378 --> 20:47.133
I am.

20:52.301 --> 20:54.698
Sorry, I.. I'm, uh...

20:55.644 --> 20:57.660
I'm married.

21:00.611 --> 21:03.276
That didn't stop her from trying again.

21:04.509 --> 21:07.416
Honey, I don't mind.

21:08.348 --> 21:10.573
Room 1217.

21:13.699 --> 21:16.055
I finished my drink.
I left her there.

21:16.055 --> 21:18.883
I didn't speak to anyone and I don't
think anyone saw me leave.

21:18.883 --> 21:20.857
Now, you need me to sign a statement,

21:20.857 --> 21:23.467
or is my word good enough?

21:25.663 --> 21:28.275
They found semen in her body.

21:28.454 --> 21:31.004
- Screw you, Eric.
- Look, Frank, it's the only way...

21:31.004 --> 21:32.426
- Get out of my car.
- Frank, listen...

21:32.426 --> 21:35.284
- Get the hell out of my car!
- Frank, listen to me, all right?!

21:39.187 --> 21:41.208
It's the only way, Frank.

21:51.235 --> 21:53.757
Open up. you know the drill.

22:00.991 --> 22:03.586
Now get the hell out of my car.

22:21.205 --> 22:23.511
How are we doing on the client list?

22:23.511 --> 22:25.355
Eric's working on it.

22:29.490 --> 22:30.703
Thank you.

22:33.350 --> 22:35.484
Eric. / H.

22:36.869 --> 22:38.314
Do we have a name yet? / Yeah.

22:38.314 --> 22:41.663
Cindy's had 19 marks
in the past six months.

22:41.663 --> 22:47.118
12 have had TROs, four moved out of state
and one was in the hospital this past week.

22:47.118 --> 22:49.546
The other one is a possible.
His name is Matthew warner.

22:49.546 --> 22:52.509
Wife threw him out, filed for divorce.

22:52.509 --> 22:55.510
No address. / Okay, here's
what we do. We start with the wife.

22:55.510 --> 22:58.259
We get his details out,
and let's find him. / Okay.

22:58.259 --> 22:59.800
All right, good.

23:02.242 --> 23:04.358
Hey, Eric...

23:04.537 --> 23:06.820
weren't there 19 names on that list?

23:06.820 --> 23:11.202
Yeah, I, um... I forgot.
Cindy's current mark.

23:11.202 --> 23:14.443
Guy didn't even know his
wife was checking up on him.

23:15.400 --> 23:17.515
Okay.

23:24.314 --> 23:26.804
I had to send the nanny away

23:26.961 --> 23:30.580
if Matthew doesn't start paying maintenance
soon, it'll be the house next.

23:30.580 --> 23:33.492
Mrs. Warner, when was the last time
you saw your husband?

23:35.648 --> 23:39.545
He came by about a week ago
to pick up the kids.

23:39.634 --> 23:42.138
We yelled at each other, and he left.

23:42.138 --> 23:44.947
- I haven't heard from him since.
- Do you know where he lives?

23:45.038 --> 23:46.175
Don't know.

23:46.175 --> 23:48.544
And don't care.

23:50.375 --> 23:52.662
Does he own a gun, Mrs. Warner?

23:52.755 --> 23:54.571
A what? / A gun.

23:54.759 --> 23:58.324
No, I don't think so.

23:58.324 --> 24:00.268
Why?

24:01.340 --> 24:03.430
You don't think he,
he did this, do you?

24:03.430 --> 24:05.210
Do you?

24:06.658 --> 24:09.783
Matthew's a cheat and
a lousy husband,

24:09.783 --> 24:12.118
but he's not a killer.

24:13.577 --> 24:15.419
Detective Salas.

24:15.646 --> 24:16.718
Mm-hmm.

24:16.718 --> 24:18.042
Okay. Thank you.

24:18.098 --> 24:19.464
What's up?

24:19.871 --> 24:22.515
They found Matthew's car
on westside avenue.

24:22.515 --> 24:25.127
Cindy castiano lives on westside.

24:25.127 --> 24:28.244
- My husband's there?
- I'm sorry. we can't discuss that.

24:28.244 --> 24:30.598
Thank you, Mrs. Warner, for your help.

24:35.909 --> 24:37.228
Suspect may be armed.

24:37.228 --> 24:38.394
Appears to be on foot.

24:38.394 --> 24:40.636
We've sealed off a two-block radius.

24:41.988 --> 24:43.435
Neighbors called in a disturbance.

24:43.435 --> 24:45.060
We found warner's car
when we arrived.

24:45.060 --> 24:48.072
- What kind of a disturbance?
- They said it sounded like wolves crying.

24:48.072 --> 24:49.422
Did you canvas the neighborhood?

24:49.422 --> 24:52.252
You know what? There's no need.
This is Cindy castiano's house.

24:52.252 --> 24:54.811
Okay. / We got the door.

24:55.894 --> 24:57.602
Hang on.

24:57.749 --> 24:59.022
Go.

25:00.798 --> 25:02.282
Police!

25:02.350 --> 25:04.604
- Are you Matthew warner?
- Don't move!

25:04.604 --> 25:06.729
- Are you Matthew warner?- On your stomach!

25:09.640 --> 25:12.712
- Yeah, I'm Matthew warner.
- Spread your legs. Hands out to your side.

25:12.712 --> 25:14.563
I'm Matthew warner.

25:20.188 --> 25:22.666
He built a shrine to her.

25:27.681 --> 25:29.768
Broke in to build that shrine.

25:29.768 --> 25:31.844
Back door's been jimmied.

25:37.996 --> 25:39.976
Hey, you missed one.

25:40.132 --> 25:41.745
No.

25:42.840 --> 25:44.863
She was pretty.

25:44.863 --> 25:47.129
Pretty girl with an ugly job.

25:49.188 --> 25:51.527
You don't think men who cheat
get what they deserve?

25:51.527 --> 25:53.018
That's not cheating.

25:53.018 --> 25:54.312
That's entrapment.

25:54.312 --> 25:55.535
They could say no.

25:55.535 --> 25:57.348
Women do all the time.

25:58.175 --> 26:01.154
Looks like Matt didn't take
no for an answer.

26:01.916 --> 26:04.063
Cindy's e-mail?

26:04.245 --> 26:08.023
Text messaging, probably hot-synced
off her cell phone.

26:08.217 --> 26:10.715
Love you to death. Matt

26:10.885 --> 26:12.994
us till eternity.
I would die for you.

26:12.994 --> 26:16.202
- Gosh, there are dozens of them.
- All from the same number, too.

26:16.202 --> 26:20.674
So, I guess Cindy was compiling evidence
until she could get a restraining order.

26:21.685 --> 26:23.701
Looks like she waited too long.

26:30.070 --> 26:31.889
Matthew,

26:32.329 --> 26:37.235
those are the fingerprints we found
on the glass inside the hotel room

26:37.235 --> 26:38.997
where Cindy was shot.

26:38.997 --> 26:42.400
They match the prints we took from you
when you were arrested.

26:43.448 --> 26:45.161
Matthew.

26:46.446 --> 26:49.442
Maybe they're from when
I met Cindy in that room.

26:49.493 --> 26:51.396
Our first date.

26:51.396 --> 26:53.940
You mean the setup, right?

26:53.940 --> 26:55.202
Technically.

26:55.202 --> 26:57.113
Your DNA...

26:57.200 --> 27:00.675
matches the semen we
found inside Cindy.

27:00.909 --> 27:02.723
She and I made love yesterday.

27:02.723 --> 27:04.890
Where did that happen,
the hotel room?

27:06.318 --> 27:07.858
No.

27:08.652 --> 27:11.872
In my car, actually.

27:11.872 --> 27:16.080
So, you're saying not
only did you love Cindy,

27:16.190 --> 27:18.039
but she loved you back.

27:18.039 --> 27:20.008
Yes.

27:20.706 --> 27:22.800
From the time we met...

27:23.160 --> 27:25.320
four months ago.

27:26.236 --> 27:30.160
She'd seen so many guys stray,
she'd given up on love until she met me.

27:30.160 --> 27:32.754
Okay, but Matthew, you strayed.

27:32.910 --> 27:35.384
You strayed, too.

27:36.218 --> 27:38.614
We were soul mates.

27:38.939 --> 27:40.580
Really.

27:41.541 --> 27:43.862
She wanted to have my children.

27:45.445 --> 27:47.312
She said that.

27:55.575 --> 27:58.443
Well, I see you've got yourself
a genuine suspect.

27:58.535 --> 28:01.431
Hope you've got more than a fingerprint
and a name on a list this time.

28:01.431 --> 28:03.831
I came to tell you, Frank,
that there, uh,

28:03.831 --> 28:06.318
was no match on your DNA.

28:07.395 --> 28:08.962
What, you...

28:08.962 --> 28:11.947
thought I might be
worried about the results, Eric?

28:13.685 --> 28:16.256
Maybe I screwed her and...

28:16.347 --> 28:18.676
forgot about it, or something?

28:24.977 --> 28:26.539
Me and Melissa..

28:26.539 --> 28:28.358
we've got issues.

28:30.605 --> 28:33.042
Personal issues.

28:35.910 --> 28:38.068
But for her to do this...

28:39.957 --> 28:43.792
hiring somebody to trick me...

28:44.170 --> 28:46.676
That's rough.

28:47.886 --> 28:50.013
Eight and a half years..

28:50.229 --> 28:52.468
that's how long we've been married.

28:57.509 --> 28:59.616
Pretty good for a cop.

29:01.772 --> 29:03.528
Hello, H. / Hey.

29:03.528 --> 29:05.079
Thanks a lot. Eric.

29:06.449 --> 29:10.032
Where are we on the murder weapon
for Cindy castiano?

29:10.032 --> 29:12.823
The divers expanded their grid search
by another 50 yards,

29:12.823 --> 29:15.424
but if they haven't found it by now,
it's probably not there to find. / Okay.

29:15.424 --> 29:18.123
That also could mean that the killer
took it with him.

29:18.123 --> 29:20.996
Yeah, well, we searched Warner's car
and the room he's renting.

29:20.996 --> 29:22.624
What about his legal address?

29:22.624 --> 29:25.515
- That's where his wife lives.
- All right, anybody needs me,

29:25.515 --> 29:29.075
that's where I'll be.
Eric, what's going on with Frank?

29:30.205 --> 29:32.235
Frank, uh...

29:33.170 --> 29:35.991
Frank's name was at the top
of that client list, H.

29:35.991 --> 29:39.393
But, uh, I didn't want to say
anything until DNA cleared him.

29:39.393 --> 29:40.975
Is he in the clear? / Yeah.

29:40.975 --> 29:42.620
He had a credible explanation.

29:42.620 --> 29:44.438
Everything checked out.

29:44.574 --> 29:45.604
All right,

29:45.604 --> 29:48.015
in the future, if you're
going to watch somebody's back,

29:48.015 --> 29:51.778
let me know about it,
so I can watch yours, all right?

29:58.656 --> 30:01.745
Mrs. Warner, when was the last time
your husband was here?

30:02.693 --> 30:05.751
He tries to see the kids
at least twice a week.

30:05.751 --> 30:09.685
So, you lied to me. He was here
more recently than a week ago, wasn't he?

30:09.685 --> 30:13.970
He sleeps on the couch
in the den some nights.

30:13.970 --> 30:15.311
What about last night?

30:15.311 --> 30:16.959
No, I never saw him.

30:16.959 --> 30:19.765
No, but he was here, wasn't he?

30:26.629 --> 30:28.577
It was late.

30:29.179 --> 30:30.830
I heard the door to the garage,

30:30.830 --> 30:34.180
figured he'd slept on the couch.

30:35.625 --> 30:39.169
This morning when
I came to look, I found it.

30:39.169 --> 30:41.564
I didn't know what to do...

30:42.529 --> 30:44.963
So, I hid it.

30:56.600 --> 30:59.113
He's the father of my children, lieutenant.

30:59.113 --> 31:02.059
It wasn't him i was protecting.

31:04.512 --> 31:06.545
It was them.

31:06.545 --> 31:10.694
I guess it's too bad there was
nobody there to protect Cindy.

31:15.958 --> 31:18.252
Calleigh, this is the gun
from matthew's house.

31:18.252 --> 31:19.860
Let me know if it's been fired recently.

31:19.860 --> 31:22.547
- I'll call as soon as I process it.
- Okay.

31:23.144 --> 31:25.786
Hey. So, what do you think
about this guy, Matthew's story?

31:25.786 --> 31:27.576
- Did they have a real relationship?
- There's only one way to find out.

31:27.576 --> 31:29.177
Let's go back to Cindy's house.

31:29.177 --> 31:31.540
- We checked it from top to bottom.
- How about the outside?

31:52.473 --> 31:54.691
Talk about stalking.

32:16.221 --> 32:18.758
Hey, heard you got prints
outside of shark girl's house.

32:18.758 --> 32:20.550
Yeah, over 50 sets.

32:20.550 --> 32:22.590
Geez, this guy was a freak.

32:24.534 --> 32:26.687
sounds like a match.
Matthew warner?

32:26.687 --> 32:29.381
I ran Warner twice, no match on AFIS.

32:29.381 --> 32:32.368
- What database is this?
- Florida justice division.

32:32.368 --> 32:36.539
It's a licensing board
for private investigators.

32:38.319 --> 32:40.193
Bruno gomez.

32:40.193 --> 32:42.354
That's our vic's boss.

32:42.537 --> 32:44.704
More like a pimp.

32:46.488 --> 32:48.009
Oh, what is this, some kind of joke?

32:48.009 --> 32:49.475
No, it's not.

32:49.475 --> 32:51.842
You want to tell me why you
were stalking Cindy castiano?

32:51.842 --> 32:54.601
Uh, excuse me, not stalking.

32:54.601 --> 32:56.319
- Protecting my investment.
- By how?

32:56.319 --> 32:58.746
Lurking outside of her house?

32:59.508 --> 33:02.738
I found your grimies all over the place.

33:03.622 --> 33:07.381
You know, I'm pretty disappointed
because you're supposed to be the spy king.

33:07.489 --> 33:10.349
You could have used a remote
camera or something. / Spy king.

33:10.349 --> 33:13.779
that's lovely. No, sometimes
low-tech is the best way to go.

33:13.779 --> 33:16.131
Okay, I had to see it with my own eyes.

33:18.055 --> 33:20.028
And when you saw her with..

33:20.028 --> 33:23.121
another man,
did that make you angry?

33:23.121 --> 33:26.322
Not angry enough to kill her
if that's what you mean.

33:26.322 --> 33:27.771
No, I didn't say that. you did.

33:27.771 --> 33:30.408
She was nothing
before I hired her, okay?

33:30.408 --> 33:32.807
I wasn't just going to let
her leave the business.

33:32.807 --> 33:33.992
So, she was going to quit.

33:33.992 --> 33:35.144
She...

33:37.136 --> 33:40.531
she told me that
she was in love, okay?

33:40.531 --> 33:41.876
She fell for a mark.

33:41.876 --> 33:43.273
Do you believe that?

33:43.273 --> 33:44.842
Maybe. Which mark?

33:44.842 --> 33:46.388
Which m...? Good question.

33:46.388 --> 33:48.403
She wouldn't tell me.
That's why I was trying to catch them.

33:48.403 --> 33:50.579
Why was that so important to you?

33:51.491 --> 33:53.035
Are you kidding?

33:53.190 --> 33:56.431
Word gets out that one of my girls
crosses the line with a mark?

33:56.431 --> 33:58.461
My business is finished, dude.

33:58.461 --> 34:01.011
Okay, what wife is going to want
to hire my company after that?

34:01.011 --> 34:02.849
I don't know, dude,

34:02.849 --> 34:05.357
but, uh, it sounds like a motive.

34:07.514 --> 34:09.746
That's good stuff.

34:47.117 --> 34:48.859
I got a match.

34:50.058 --> 34:52.618
So do we have...

34:52.618 --> 34:54.004
a murder weapon?

34:54.004 --> 34:56.683
Well, this is the gun that
killed Cindy castiano, but

34:56.683 --> 34:58.750
there's something else
that you should see.

34:58.750 --> 35:00.077
Looks like oxidation.

35:00.077 --> 35:03.468
It's called patina. It's the natural
reaction of copper-jacketed bullets

35:03.468 --> 35:05.295
when they're exposed to water.

35:05.295 --> 35:07.806
The gun was wet when we
took it out of the pool filter.

35:07.806 --> 35:10.009
But that was fresh water and
the amount of corrosion

35:10.009 --> 35:12.019
that you're seeing has
to occur in saltwater.

35:12.019 --> 35:14.586
Then that means that
the gun was in the marina.

35:14.586 --> 35:17.176
And so was the killer.

35:22.031 --> 35:24.550
So, Cindy struggles with her attacker.

35:24.550 --> 35:27.958
They both go in the water,
and only one comes out.

35:28.315 --> 35:29.613
No.

35:37.214 --> 35:39.300
The question is how do we prove it?

35:39.430 --> 35:41.448
We need their shoes.

35:42.047 --> 35:44.731
We tested both Bruno
and Matthew's shoes.

35:44.731 --> 35:46.914
No trace of salt in either of them.

35:47.669 --> 35:50.372
It looks like our murderer
dumped his footwear.

35:50.492 --> 35:52.619
Maybe we're looking in the wrong place.

35:52.619 --> 35:55.718
Matthew moved out of the house,

35:55.858 --> 35:59.615
but still visits his kids and
stays over some nights, doesn't he?

35:59.615 --> 36:02.396
Makes sense to leave
a change of clothes there.

36:02.396 --> 36:04.213
Maybe some shoes?

36:07.129 --> 36:09.636
I didn't want any of his stuff in the house,

36:11.829 --> 36:15.695
so he keeps a change
of clothes in the top box.

36:28.907 --> 36:30.619
What is it, lieutenant?

36:30.726 --> 36:33.034
These shoes have been
in saltwater recently.

36:33.034 --> 36:37.022
See, when the water evaporates,
it leaves a salty residue.

36:37.230 --> 36:39.699
You mind if I take these with me?

36:47.073 --> 36:50.182
I won't help you make
a case against Matthew.

36:50.182 --> 36:53.277
Mrs. Warner, Matthew's
shoe size is about a 9.

36:53.277 --> 36:55.556
Those are about a 7.

36:55.556 --> 36:59.387
So this is no longer about him.
This is about you.

37:00.880 --> 37:03.240
Then you'll need a warrant.

37:03.469 --> 37:05.691
Please get off my property.

37:07.137 --> 37:08.660
She just left with the evidence.

37:08.660 --> 37:10.330
By the time we get a warrant,

37:10.330 --> 37:11.696
those shoes are going
to be long gone.

37:11.696 --> 37:15.500
Well, we'll just have to find
another way to get her then.

37:23.320 --> 37:26.522
I've thrown every piece
of audio software I have at it.

37:26.522 --> 37:27.824
This is as good as it gets.

37:27.824 --> 37:29.853
Please don't hurt... baby.

37:29.853 --> 37:32.131
Please don't hurt me, baby.

37:32.131 --> 37:34.227
It sounds like she's talking
to someone she knows.

37:34.227 --> 37:35.865
Not necessarily.

37:35.961 --> 37:37.482
Play that again.

37:39.206 --> 37:41.396
Please don't hurt... baby.

37:41.519 --> 37:45.303
Matthew warner said Cindy wanted
to have children, right?

37:45.778 --> 37:46.698
Hold on a second.

37:48.260 --> 37:49.664
Alexx. / Hey, H.

37:49.664 --> 37:53.258
Let's run an HCG test on Cindy
castiano's blood sample, please.

37:53.258 --> 37:56.058
You want me to test for human
chorionic gonadotropin?

37:56.058 --> 37:56.970
Mm-hmm.

37:56.970 --> 37:58.232
What are you not telling me?

37:58.232 --> 38:00.608
Just let me know as
soon as you have it.

38:00.931 --> 38:02.534
You got it.

38:05.470 --> 38:08.629
The victim's blood was
positive for HCG.

38:13.411 --> 38:16.167
- She was pregnant.
- About three months.

38:16.167 --> 38:19.758
The shark attack took pieces of her
abdominal cavity, including her uterus.

38:19.758 --> 38:21.297
Otherwise we would have
caught it right away.

38:21.297 --> 38:23.198
Please...

38:23.198 --> 38:25.849
please, don't hurt my baby.

38:26.027 --> 38:28.170
That's what she said on the tape.

38:28.170 --> 38:31.075
Please don't hurt my baby. Pleading,

38:31.370 --> 38:33.932
pleading for the life of her child.

38:34.074 --> 38:36.155
An unplanned child...

38:36.478 --> 38:39.756
The child may have
been unplanned, Alexx,

38:40.046 --> 38:41.802
but the murder wasn't.

38:45.150 --> 38:48.237
I don't know how you could
think I killed that woman.

38:48.367 --> 38:51.784
I hired her. / Yes, you did till she
fell in love with your husband.

38:51.784 --> 38:54.051
So, my husband is weak.

38:54.161 --> 38:56.026
- Doesn't make me a murderer.
- It doesn't, Leslie.

38:56.026 --> 38:58.220
The evidence makes you a murderer.

38:58.220 --> 38:59.875
You had Matthew's gun.

38:59.875 --> 39:03.089
You knew which hotel
Cindy worked in.

39:03.089 --> 39:07.631
All you had to do was
get Matthew into that room.

39:08.414 --> 39:11.517
It was easy to steal a glass
from room service.

39:14.898 --> 39:17.269
Then you had to get
Matthew's prints on it.

39:17.378 --> 39:19.760
I can't do this now. I don't understand.
You invite me over here to yell at me?

39:19.760 --> 39:22.839
But it's different because you
do not live here anymore.

39:22.839 --> 39:24.620
- That's the reason.
- Is this why you invited me over here?

39:24.620 --> 39:27.784
Let's sit down and speak rationally.

39:27.784 --> 39:29.782
Just go. Just leave.

39:31.528 --> 39:36.891
And then you had to find a way into that
hotel room where you could wait.

39:39.945 --> 39:42.467
- Hey, who are you?
- What are you doing here?

39:42.529 --> 39:43.849
Stop.

39:43.849 --> 39:45.967
Please don't hurt my baby.

39:54.797 --> 39:59.261
The thing that you were not
counting on was Cindy running.

39:59.261 --> 40:01.161
She ran, you followed,

40:01.161 --> 40:05.125
and that's how your gun
and shoes got wet.

40:11.073 --> 40:12.430
No!

40:17.500 --> 40:20.037
You both ended up in the water.

40:20.930 --> 40:23.187
But only you got out.

40:25.411 --> 40:27.755
Did you know she hung on all night?

40:28.473 --> 40:31.430
Leslie, it's one thing to
lose your husband,

40:31.698 --> 40:36.860
but it's quite another thing to have the new
lady in his life end up pregnant, isn't it?

40:36.860 --> 40:38.725
And that's...

40:38.725 --> 40:40.765
that's what pushed you over the edge.

40:42.484 --> 40:45.512
My kids came back
from Matthew's place.

40:45.580 --> 40:48.153
You know what she told them?

40:48.348 --> 40:51.601
They're going to have
a new sister or brother.

40:53.927 --> 40:57.305
That bitch thought she was going
to be their new mom.

40:57.427 --> 40:59.414
I couldn't let that happen.

40:59.414 --> 41:00.932
No, you couldn't.

41:00.932 --> 41:02.662
See the problem, Leslie,

41:02.662 --> 41:08.194
the problem now, is that your own
kids don't have a mother.

41:13.213 --> 41:15.584
