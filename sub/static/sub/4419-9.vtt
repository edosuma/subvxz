WHY DO WE ALWAYS HOLD THE
"SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL" HERE?

00:44.902 --> 00:45.968
IT'S SO PAINFULLY
CROWDED.

00:45.970 --> 00:49.338
PEOPLE FROM L.A. LOVE TO COME
TO A QUAINT LITTLE TOWN,

00:49.340 --> 00:51.240
AND THIS GIVES THEM
AN EXCUSE.

00:51.242 --> 00:54.376
THIS USED TO BE
A QUAINT LITTLE TOWN,
NOW LOOK AT IT,

00:54.378 --> 00:58.614
SUSHI RESTAURANTS,
UPSCALE CLOTHES STORES,
$25 DOLLAR PARKING,

00:58.616 --> 00:59.348
LIAM NEESON.

00:59.350 --> 01:01.784
I THINK WE'VE TAPPED
THIS TOWN'S RESOURCES OUT.

01:01.786 --> 01:06.121
WE MUST MOVE THE FESTIVAL
TO ANOTHER SMALL TOWN
AND BEGIN AGAIN.

01:06.123 --> 01:09.425
THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA,
BUT WHERE?

01:12.263 --> 01:15.130
( humming )

01:17.802 --> 01:20.870
( noisy street hubbub )

01:21.339 --> 01:22.204
WHOA.

01:22.206 --> 01:25.574
O.K. CHILDREN,
I HAVE SOME VERY EXCITING
NEWS FOR YOU,

01:25.576 --> 01:27.443
WHY DON'T YOU TELL THEM
MR. TWIG?

01:27.445 --> 01:28.644
THAT'S RIGHT,
MR. GARRISON,

01:28.646 --> 01:32.615
THE FIRST ANNUAL
"SOUTH PARK FILM FESTIVAL"
BEGINS TODAY.

01:32.617 --> 01:33.382
WOW, COOL!

01:33.384 --> 01:36.118
THEY'RE NOT GONNA SHOW THAT
STUPID-ASS "GODZILLA" MOVIE?

01:36.120 --> 01:38.487
NO, THESE ARE
"INDEPENDENT" FILMS.

01:38.489 --> 01:39.922
LIKE "INDEPENDENCE DAY"?

01:39.924 --> 01:40.890
THAT SUCKED-ASS TOO.

01:40.892 --> 01:43.192
INDEPENDENT FILMS ARE THOSE
BLACK & WHITE HIPPIE MOVIES.

01:43.194 --> 01:45.194
THEY'RE ABOUT GAY COWBOYS
EATING PUDDING.

01:45.196 --> 01:49.298
NO, INDEPENDENT FILMS
ARE PRODUCED OUTSIDE
THE HOLLYWOOD SYSTEM.

01:49.300 --> 01:51.133
WITHOUT ALL THE
GLITZ AND GLAMOR.

01:51.135 --> 01:55.905
YOU SHOW ME ONE THAT<i> ISN'T</i> ABOUT
GAY COWBOYS EATING PUDDING.

01:55.907 --> 01:58.540
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT, FAT-ASS!

01:58.542 --> 02:02.344
I'M NOT FAT, I JUST HAVEN'T
GROWN INTO MY BODY YET,
SKINNY BITCH!

02:02.346 --> 02:04.813
IF YOU CALL WENDY A "BITCH"
ONE MORE TIME,

02:04.815 --> 02:07.783
I'M SENDING YOU TO
THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE.

02:09.287 --> 02:09.952
BITCH.

02:09.954 --> 02:10.853
THAT'S IT!

02:10.855 --> 02:11.787
I'M GOING!

02:11.789 --> 02:15.257
I WANT YOU ALL TO SEE AT LEAST
ONE INDEPENDENT FILM,

02:15.259 --> 02:17.059
AND WRITE
A PAPER ABOUT IT.

02:17.061 --> 02:18.093
EHHH...
AWW... AWW...

02:18.095 --> 02:20.663
THE FIRST FILM IS CALLED
"WITNESS TO DENIAL",

02:20.665 --> 02:24.166
A SEXUAL EXPLORATION PIECE
ABOUT TWO WOMEN IN LOVE.

02:24.168 --> 02:27.202
MY UNCLE JIMBO HAS
A TON OF THOSE MOVIES.

02:27.204 --> 02:30.439
NO, I WANT TO SHOOT THE SCRIPT
WITH DEMI MOORE ATTACHED.

02:30.441 --> 02:32.274
YOU TELL SPIELBERG
HE CAN KISS MY ASS.

02:32.276 --> 02:35.277
LOOK AT THIS,
TRAFFIC JAMS AT
EVERY INTERSECTION,

02:35.279 --> 02:37.880
HORDES OF PEOPLE PUSHING
THROUGH THE CROWDS,

02:37.882 --> 02:39.214
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
WE'RE A REAL CITY.

02:39.216 --> 02:41.951
I CAN'T BELIEVE I GOT SENT
TO THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

02:41.953 --> 02:43.652
BECAUSE OF YOUR
STUPID GIRLFRIEND.

02:43.654 --> 02:45.387
SHE'S NOT
MY GIRLFRIEND!

02:45.389 --> 02:46.622
( mumbling )

02:46.624 --> 02:48.490
HA HA HA!

02:48.492 --> 02:49.258
SICK, KENNY.

02:49.260 --> 02:50.492
DAMN, LOOK AT
ALL THESE PEOPLE!

02:50.494 --> 02:51.994
I'M LATE FOR
A SCREENING....

02:51.996 --> 02:53.996
ALL THIS FOR A BUNCH OF
STUPID MOVIES?

02:53.998 --> 02:55.397
HELLO THERE,
CHILDREN.

02:55.399 --> 02:56.365
HEY, CHEF
WHATCHA' DOIN'.

02:56.367 --> 03:00.970
THIS FILM FESTIVAL THING
HAS MONETARY POSSIBILITIES,

03:00.972 --> 03:05.474
I'M GONNA SELL
MY FAMOUS COOKIES
TO THESE HOLLYWOOD TYPES,

03:05.476 --> 03:06.542
AND MAKE A MINT.

03:06.544 --> 03:07.977
WHAT KIND
OF COOKIES?

03:07.979 --> 03:08.811
CALM DOWN, TUBBY.

03:08.813 --> 03:11.347
LITTLE COOKIES,
WITH FUDGE IN THE MIDDLE,

03:11.349 --> 03:14.149
AND I CALL THEM
"FUDGE 'EMS."

03:14.151 --> 03:15.184
I WANT A FUDGE 'EM.

03:15.186 --> 03:17.386
I CAN SEE
THE COMMERCIAL--

03:17.388 --> 03:18.587
"WIFE GOT YOU DOWN?

03:18.589 --> 03:20.022
"BOSS MAKING
YOU ANGRY?

03:20.024 --> 03:21.657
"KIDS YELLING AT YOU?

03:21.659 --> 03:23.359
WELL, FUDGE 'EM!"

03:23.361 --> 03:26.562
I'VE ALSO GOT MY
DOUBLE-CHOCOLATE COOKIES

03:26.564 --> 03:27.429
"FUDGE THIS"!

03:27.431 --> 03:31.000
ONE OF THE NATIVES IS
SELLING LOCAL FOODWARES!

03:31.002 --> 03:32.234
THIS IS WHY I COME
TO THESE THINGS,

03:32.236 --> 03:35.270
TO GET AWAY FROM L.A.,
AND BECOME ONE WITH
A MORE SIMPLE CULTURE.

03:35.272 --> 03:39.708
PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE TO TRY
MY LOW-CALORIE COOKIES--

03:39.710 --> 03:42.778
OR MY ALL-NATURAL--

03:42.780 --> 03:45.347
DO YOU HAVE ANY TOFU,
OR STEAMED CELERY?

03:45.349 --> 03:48.217
I WOULD KILL FOR SOME
COUSCOUS RIGHT NOW.

03:48.219 --> 03:49.084
WHO'S GOOSE?

03:49.086 --> 03:53.889
NEVER MIND, WE BROUGHT SOME FOOD
FROM THE NATURAL MARKET IN L.A.

03:54.091 --> 03:56.692
I HAVE TWO TICKETS FOR
THE OPENING FILM,

03:56.694 --> 03:57.893
WOULD YOU LIKE TO
COME WITH ME?

03:57.895 --> 04:00.996
( mimicking )
STAN, MEH MEH MEH,

04:00.998 --> 04:05.534
SURE DUDE, SINCE WE HAVE TO
WRITE A PAPER ANYWAY.

04:05.536 --> 04:09.238
SHE'LL BE THE
DEATH OF HIM, KYLE,
MARK MY WORDS.

04:09.240 --> 04:11.573
IF SHE HOLDS HIS HAND,
IT'LL BE ALL OVER.

04:11.575 --> 04:15.411
GET 'EM WHILE THEIR HOT,
MY ALL-NEW COOKIES,

04:15.413 --> 04:17.513
"I JUST WENT AND
FUDGED YOUR MAMA"

04:17.515 --> 04:20.149
HE SURE RAN THAT ONE
INTO THE GROUND.

04:22.653 --> 04:24.053
I HOPE THERE'S SOME
GOOD PREVIEWS.

04:24.055 --> 04:27.156
FILM FESTIVAL MOVIES DON'T
USUALLY HAVE PREVIEWS--

04:27.158 --> 04:28.657
THEY WHAT?!

04:31.562 --> 04:34.496
( male )
Who are to judge
my Womanly Soul?

04:34.498 --> 04:37.699
The Goddess flames,
that burn in my memory,

04:37.701 --> 04:38.734
aren't dark.

04:38.736 --> 04:41.336
Dare<i> you</i> call them dark.

04:41.338 --> 04:44.907
Here lies the Goddess truth
of my body.

04:44.909 --> 04:45.774
OH, BROTHER.

04:45.776 --> 04:51.080
The Goddess that cries,
"Freedom, here is
the Goddess truth,

04:51.082 --> 04:52.881
"of my womanly being."

04:52.883 --> 04:55.651
You are my blossom, my flame,
when we make love,

04:55.653 --> 04:58.353
it's like the sun is
right outside the door.

04:58.355 --> 05:00.923
Make love to me,

05:23.380 --> 05:25.848
Howdy Ho!

05:25.850 --> 05:27.015
MR. HANKEY?

05:27.017 --> 05:28.617
MR. HANKEY,
IS THAT YOU?

05:28.619 --> 05:29.818
HELLO?

05:30.754 --> 05:32.554
I'M HERE IN
SOUTH PARK, COLORADO,

05:32.556 --> 05:35.257
WHERE CITIZENS FROM L.A.
ARE ARRIVING IN DROVES

05:35.259 --> 05:37.826
FOR THE TOWN'S
FIRST FILM FESTIVAL.

05:37.828 --> 05:39.795
THIS IS A
QUIET COMMUNITY

05:39.797 --> 05:41.830
WHERE NOTHING
OUT-OF-THE-ORDINARY
EVER HAPPENS-

05:41.832 --> 05:44.867
( lowers voice )
except for the occasional
destruction of the entire town--

05:44.869 --> 05:48.103
AND SO THE EXCITEMENT LEVEL
IS NATURALLY VERY HIGH.

05:48.105 --> 05:50.205
THE TOWNSPEOPLE
ARE ANXIOUSLY AWAITING

05:50.207 --> 05:52.875
THE ARRIVAL OF
SOME TOP CELEBRITIES.

05:52.877 --> 05:54.276
IT WAS HIM, DUDE,
MR. HANKEY!

05:54.278 --> 05:57.913
I THOUGHT MR. HANKEY
ONLY CAME AT CHRISTMAS TIME?

05:57.915 --> 05:59.114
I'M SURE
IT WAS HIM!

05:59.116 --> 06:00.749
HERE COMES SOMEBODY!

06:00.751 --> 06:02.384
I CAN'T SEE...

06:02.386 --> 06:03.018
OH!

06:03.020 --> 06:06.188
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
T.V.'S FRED SAVAGE!

06:06.190 --> 06:08.123
( All )
AWWWW...!

06:08.125 --> 06:10.759
I'M SURE A REAL PERSON
WILL SHOW UP SOON.

06:10.761 --> 06:11.860
HOW WAS THAT MOVIE?

06:11.862 --> 06:13.195
YOU DON'T EVEN
WANT TO KNOW.

06:13.197 --> 06:15.831
BUNCH OF GAY COWBOYS
EATING PUDDING?

06:15.833 --> 06:16.632
PRETTY MUCH.

06:16.634 --> 06:18.634
THE THEATER SUCKS,
THEY NEED TO GET
A BIGGER SCREEN.

06:18.636 --> 06:22.304
THEY SHOULD PROJECT THE MOVIES
ON CARTMAN'S ASS.

06:22.306 --> 06:22.938
HEY!

06:22.940 --> 06:24.006
BUT THAT'D BE
LIKE "IMAX".

06:24.008 --> 06:26.808
THAT'S ENOUGH FAT-ASS JOKES
FOR THIS WEEK.

06:26.810 --> 06:30.312
( mumbling )

06:30.314 --> 06:32.347
HA HA!HA HA! HA HA!

06:32.349 --> 06:37.186
THAT DOES IT,
SCREW YOU GUYS,
I'M GOING HOME.

06:39.690 --> 06:41.089
WELL?

06:41.158 --> 06:43.292
JUST GIVE ME
A MINUTE.

06:43.594 --> 06:46.195
THIS IS PERFECT,
WHY DIDN'T WE
THINK OF IT SOONER?

06:46.197 --> 06:47.829
THIS TOWN STILL HAS
SOME CHARM LEFT.

06:47.831 --> 06:49.765
NOT THE MESS WE TURNED
PARK CITY INTO.

06:49.767 --> 06:54.369
WON'T WE END UP JUST DOING
THE SAME THING TO THIS TOWN?

06:54.371 --> 06:57.673
YES, AND THE TOWN AFTER,
AND THE TOWN AFTER THAT,

06:57.675 --> 07:01.076
LIKE TERMITES, WE WILL MOVE THIS
FILM FESTIVAL FROM TOWN TO TOWN

07:01.078 --> 07:03.412
UNTIL WE HAVE USED IT UP,
AND THEN MOVE ON,

07:03.414 --> 07:06.481
UNTIL EVERY QUIET TOWN
IS LIKE L.A.

07:06.483 --> 07:08.617
WHY WOULD WE DO
SUCH A THING?

07:08.619 --> 07:10.052
BECAUSE,
<i>WE</i> HAVE TO LIVE IN L.A.,

07:10.054 --> 07:13.121
AND IF WE CAN'T LIVE IN
QUIET, PEACEFUL TOWNS,

07:13.123 --> 07:15.257
THEN NOBODY WILL.

07:15.259 --> 07:17.292
HA HA HA HA!

07:17.294 --> 07:21.863
WAIT, WAIT-- ZOOM IN
TO A CLOSE-UP OF MY FACE
WHEN I DO THAT, READY?

07:21.865 --> 07:23.365
THEN NOBODY WILL!

07:23.367 --> 07:25.267
HA HA HA HA!

07:25.269 --> 07:25.968
THAT'S IT.

07:25.970 --> 07:27.636
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE,

07:27.638 --> 07:29.705
I WANT YOU TO CHECK OUT
MY NEW CONFECTIONARIES,

07:29.707 --> 07:31.807
I THINK THEY'RE GONNA SELL
THROUGH THE ROOF.

07:31.809 --> 07:35.877
I CALL THEM
"CHEF'S SALTY CHOCOLATE BALLS".

07:35.879 --> 07:37.379

07:37.381 --> 07:38.814

07:52.596 --> 07:55.030

"THE GOONIES"?

08:54.491 --> 08:57.759

09:10.974 --> 09:13.008
HI, MR. HANKEY...

09:13.010 --> 09:16.278
HAVE YOU BEEN BRUSHING
BEHIND YOUR TEETH?

09:16.280 --> 09:17.079
( All )
YES.

09:17.081 --> 09:18.647
AND USING DENTAL FLOSS?

09:18.649 --> 09:19.514
( All )
YES.

09:19.516 --> 09:21.216
AND WASHING
BEHIND YOUR EARS?

09:21.218 --> 09:22.784
YES. NO.

09:23.253 --> 09:24.953
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
ARE YOU SICK?

09:24.955 --> 09:27.089
I'VE JUST GOT
A LITTLE COLD.

09:27.091 --> 09:31.093
ALL THESE NEW PEOPLE
ARE STRESSFUL TO MY HOME.

09:31.095 --> 09:31.960
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

09:31.962 --> 09:35.430
THE SEWER IS
A FRAGILE ECOSYSTEM--

09:35.432 --> 09:36.331
OH MY GOD.

09:36.333 --> 09:41.069
THESE NEW FOLKS EAT NOTHING
BUT COUSCOUS, TOFU AND
RAW VEGETABLES,

09:41.071 --> 09:43.372
AND IT'S DESTROYING
MY ENVIRONMENT.

09:43.374 --> 09:44.840
THAT'S WHY YOU
GOT A COLD?

09:44.842 --> 09:46.675
THAT'S WHY, KYLE.

09:46.677 --> 09:47.943
WHY DON'T YOU ASK THEM
TO LEAVE?

09:47.945 --> 09:52.848
THERE'S ONLY TIME A YEAR
I CAN COME TO THE SURFACE,
CHRISTMAS TIME,

09:52.850 --> 09:55.784
THAT'S WHY I NEED YOU BOYS
TO GO FOR ME.

09:55.786 --> 09:58.520
DON'T WORRY, MR. HANKEY,
WE'LL GO TELL EVERYONE.

09:58.522 --> 10:02.991
DON'T FORGET TO CHANGE YOUR
SHEETS ONCE A WEEK!

10:05.529 --> 10:09.564
SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO,
WE WILL BEGIN THIS AMAZING FILM.

10:09.566 --> 10:11.700
IT'S A WORK OF BLOOD,
SWEAT AND TEARS.

10:11.702 --> 10:14.035
WAIT, CAN I HAVE
YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE?

10:14.037 --> 10:16.338
IS THAT
LEONARDO DICAPRIO?

10:17.441 --> 10:19.474
NO, WAIT,
THAT'S NOT HIM.

10:19.476 --> 10:20.275
AWWWW...

10:20.277 --> 10:22.043
MY BEST FRIEND
IS GETTING SICK,

10:22.045 --> 10:25.914
BECAUSE SOUTH PARK IS
OVERCROWDED WITH PEOPLE
WHO EAT HEALTH FOOD.

10:25.916 --> 10:28.483
EXCUSE ME,
WHAT'S A "MR. HANKEY"?

10:28.485 --> 10:30.519
HE'S A TALKING PIECE OF POO
THAT LIVES IN THE SEWER,

10:30.521 --> 10:34.890
BUT HE'S GETTING SICK
BECAUSE OF ALL THE EXTRA POO
IN THE SEWER.

10:34.892 --> 10:37.392
IF YOU DON'T ALL LEAVE,
MR. HANKEY'S GONNA DIE.

10:37.394 --> 10:40.295
HE'S ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS
IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD,

10:40.297 --> 10:42.664
AND I DON'T WANT HIM
TO DIE.

10:43.934 --> 10:45.267
WHAT A GREAT STORY!

10:45.269 --> 10:46.868
THIS COULD BE THE NEXT
"FREE WILLY"!

10:46.870 --> 10:49.004
GREAT PITCH,
HOW MUCH DO YOU
WANT FOR IT?

10:49.006 --> 10:51.840
DOES IT HAVE TO BE
A TALKING PIECE OF POO...?

10:51.842 --> 10:53.708
IT CAN BE
A CRIME-FIGHTING RABBIT

10:53.710 --> 10:55.911
OR A LOVEABLE TURTLE.

10:55.913 --> 10:57.312
CAN WE PUT
A MONKEY IN IT?

10:57.314 --> 11:00.482
IS HARRISON FORD AVAILABLE
FOR A FALL PIC?

11:00.484 --> 11:01.383
KEANU REEVES.

11:01.385 --> 11:02.217
MATT DAMON.

11:02.219 --> 11:03.552
FRED SAVAGE.

11:03.554 --> 11:06.555
HA HA!
HA HA! HA HA!

11:06.557 --> 11:08.323
I'D PAY A MILLION
FOR THIS STORY.

11:08.325 --> 11:09.925
I'LL PAY TWO!

11:10.961 --> 11:12.661
DUDE, NO ONE EVEN
LISTENED TO ME.

11:12.663 --> 11:14.329
IT DOES SOUND LIKE
A PRETTY SWEET MOVIE.

11:14.331 --> 11:17.866
YOU'RE PART OWNER OF THIS
MR. HOOEY STORY, RIGHT?

11:17.868 --> 11:19.034
YEAH, I GUESS.

11:19.036 --> 11:22.704
I WANT YOU TO DO
A BIG MONEY DEAL WITH ME.

11:22.706 --> 11:26.408
I CAN SEE THAT<i> YOU'RE</i>
THE REAL BRAINS OF THE GROUP.

11:26.410 --> 11:28.076
YOU DON'T NEED
THOSE GUYS.

11:28.078 --> 11:30.378
SCREW THOSE GUYS,
I DON'T EVEN LIKE THEM!

11:30.380 --> 11:33.482
THAT'S GREAT,
LET'S MAKE A DEAL.

11:33.484 --> 11:36.518
I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL
FOR MAKING THE FIRST ANNUAL

11:36.520 --> 11:38.687
"SOUTH PARK FILM FESTIVAL"
A SUCCESS.

11:38.689 --> 11:41.590
THE FESTIVAL HAS
SEEN MORE ATTENDANCE

11:41.592 --> 11:44.759
THAN LAST YEAR'S
"SUNDANCE FESTIVAL."

11:44.761 --> 11:46.094
( cheering )

11:46.096 --> 11:47.729
AND I'M PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE,

11:47.731 --> 11:50.398
THAT IN HONOR OF
THE SOUTH PARK PEOPLE,

11:50.400 --> 11:54.069
WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A
"HOLLYWOOD PLANET" RESTAURANT,

11:54.071 --> 11:57.172
WHERE THIS LIBRARY
USED TO STAND.

11:59.076 --> 12:00.041
( collective gasp )

12:00.043 --> 12:00.909
CAN THEY DO THAT?

12:00.911 --> 12:03.478
THEY'RE HOLLYWOOD,
THEY CAN DO ANYTHING.

12:05.749 --> 12:07.282
MR. HANKEY?

12:09.786 --> 12:10.785
MR. HANKEY?

12:10.787 --> 12:17.425
( organ music playing )

12:17.427 --> 12:18.193
MR. HANKEY?

12:18.195 --> 12:21.763
OH, HOWDY HO-OH--
( coughing )

12:21.765 --> 12:23.098
HOW DID IT GO?

12:23.100 --> 12:25.834
IS EVERYONE GOING TO STOP
POOPIN' IN MY ENVIRONMENT?

12:25.836 --> 12:28.003
THEY THOUGHT I WAS
PITCHING A MOVIE.

12:28.005 --> 12:31.172
OH, I SEE...
WELL, SHUCKS KYLE,

12:31.174 --> 12:34.976
I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH
FOR TRYING.

12:38.048 --> 12:41.149
WE ONLY HAVE ONE OPTION,
I'VE GOTTA TAKE YOU
TO THE SURFACE.

12:41.151 --> 12:42.717
THE SUN'LL
DRY ME OUT.

12:42.719 --> 12:44.786
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO PROVE YOU'RE REAL.

12:44.788 --> 12:46.521
I WON'T LAST LONG
UP ABOVE.

12:46.523 --> 12:48.657
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LAST
DOWN HERE EITHER,

12:48.659 --> 12:50.392
I'M NOT GONNA
LET YOU DIE.

12:50.394 --> 12:53.762
JUST LET ME GET
MY TOOTHBRUSH.

12:54.131 --> 12:56.965
C'MON STAN,
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE.

12:58.135 --> 13:01.670
JEEZ, THEY MADE THAT
INTO A MOVIE ALREADY?

13:01.872 --> 13:05.574
MR. HANKEY,
I CAN'T GO ON,
I'VE LOST THE FIGHT.

13:05.576 --> 13:06.875
NO, I'M NOT LEAVING
WITHOUT YOU.

13:06.877 --> 13:09.945
WE STARTED THIS TOGETHER,
WE'RE GONNA FINISH IT TOGETHER.

13:09.947 --> 13:14.916
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
DEATH WAS GLORIOUS,
NOW I KNOW IT'S NOT.

13:16.253 --> 13:20.455
PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE KNOCKING
MY DOOR DOWN TO GET YOU.

13:20.457 --> 13:21.990
WHO THE HELL CAST
TOM HANKS?

13:21.992 --> 13:24.392
HE CAN'T ACT HIS WAY
OUT OF A NUT-SACK!

13:24.394 --> 13:26.795
I'LL ALWAYS LOVE YOU,
MR. HANKEY.

13:26.797 --> 13:28.964
( mimicking )
MEH MEH MEH MEH.

13:34.338 --> 13:36.871
OH MY GOD,
I FOUND A PENNY!

13:36.873 --> 13:38.373
YOU BASTARD.

13:40.544 --> 13:42.644
OK, WE'RE OUT,
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

13:42.646 --> 13:44.713
IT SURE IS DRY
UP HERE.

13:44.715 --> 13:47.082
DON'T WORRY,
WE'LL DO THIS QUICK.

13:47.084 --> 13:49.451
JUST HANG ON,
MR. HANKEY.

13:51.655 --> 13:55.457
MR. FILM COMMISSIONER,
COULD I HAVE A WORD WITH YOU?

13:55.459 --> 13:57.826
THE PEOPLE OF MY TOWN
ARE A LITTLE UPSET,

13:57.828 --> 14:01.363
I DON'T THINK WE REALIZED
THE IMPACT THIS FESTIVAL
WOULD HAVE.

14:01.365 --> 14:05.967
SO, WE WERE WONDERING,
IF WE COULD CALL
THIS WHOLE THING OFF?

14:05.969 --> 14:08.069
WE HAVE CONTRACTS,
YOU TRY TO PULL OUT NOW,

14:08.071 --> 14:10.739
WE'LL SUE YOUR TOWN
FOR EVERY PENNY IT'S GOT.

14:10.741 --> 14:12.907
BUT THANKS FOR
THE HARD WORK.

14:12.909 --> 14:14.843
BUT THIS DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE TO ME,

14:14.845 --> 14:17.646
YOU TOLD ME THE MOVIE
MADE A LOT OF MONEY.

14:17.648 --> 14:18.513
RIGHT, TWO MILLION,

14:18.515 --> 14:20.582
MINUS YOUR AGENT'S FEE,
MINUS YOUR LAWYER'S FEE,

14:20.584 --> 14:23.585
MINUS MY FEE WITH PUBLICITY
AND TAXES TAKEN OUT,

14:23.587 --> 14:24.519
YOU GET $3 DOLLARS!

14:24.521 --> 14:27.122
THAT'S MORE THAN MOST PEOPLE
IN YOUR POSITION MAKE.

14:27.124 --> 14:29.024
SERVES YOU RIGHT,
YOU'RE A SELLOUT.

14:29.026 --> 14:30.558
I'M NOT A SELLOUT,
WHAT'S A SELLOUT?

14:30.560 --> 14:33.561
IF YOU WORK IN
THE ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS,
AND YOU MAKE MONEY.

14:33.563 --> 14:37.632
IT'S ALL GONE TO HELL,
AND WE'RE ALL TO BLAME, EVEN ME.

14:37.634 --> 14:41.703
I WAS SELLING OUT MY TOWN TOO,
NOW LOOK AT IT.

14:41.705 --> 14:42.871
SO WHAT DO WE
DO NOW?

14:42.873 --> 14:46.875
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO,
JUST SIT HERE,
AND SUCK ON MY BALLS.

14:46.877 --> 14:47.942
WE HAVE TO HURRY!

14:47.944 --> 14:50.445
COME ON, EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE O.K.!

14:50.447 --> 14:52.080
SIR, SIR!
NOT NOW.

14:52.082 --> 14:55.917
I HAVE TO
SHOW YOU SOMETHING...

14:55.919 --> 14:56.751
WHAT'S THIS?

14:56.753 --> 14:59.354
I WANT YOU GUYS TO
MEET MY FRIEND.

15:03.694 --> 15:07.495
THAT'S GREAT, A DRIED-OUT
LUMP OF SH-- ( bleep! ),
VERY COMPELLING.

15:07.497 --> 15:11.433
OK, WE'VE GOTTA HAVE
THAT SIGN DONE FOR TONIGHT.

15:11.435 --> 15:12.967
YOU CAN'T DIE,
MR. HANKEY.

15:12.969 --> 15:18.573
( coughing)
KYLE... BEFORE I GO...

15:18.575 --> 15:22.444
THERE'S SOMETHING
I MUST TELL YOU...

15:22.446 --> 15:25.146
COME CLOSER...

15:25.882 --> 15:27.749

COME CLOSER...

15:43.400 --> 15:44.466
WHAT IS IT?

15:44.468 --> 15:46.101
CLOSER.

15:46.103 --> 15:46.701
YES?

15:46.703 --> 15:47.402
CLOSER!

15:47.404 --> 15:50.872
ONE TIME...
WHEN YOU WERE SLEEPING...

15:50.874 --> 15:53.074
I PUT MYSELF
IN YOUR MOUTH...

15:53.076 --> 15:57.679
AND HAD MY FRIEND
TAKE A PICTURE...
EHHH...

15:57.681 --> 15:58.613

16:19.569 --> 16:20.468
NO!

16:20.470 --> 16:22.137
DUDE, I'M HERE FOR YOU.

16:22.139 --> 16:24.839
READY TO GO SEE
ANOTHER MOVIE?

16:24.841 --> 16:26.241
OK.

16:27.444 --> 16:30.945
( Western music playing )

16:30.947 --> 16:33.548
SAY TOM,
DO YOU HAVE ANY PUDDING LEFT?

16:33.550 --> 16:35.083
I ATE ALL MINE UP,

WELL, THEN,

HEY!

16:44.261 --> 16:44.859
SORRY.

16:44.861 --> 16:47.562
WHY DON'T WE JUST
EXPLORE OUR SEXUALITY?

16:47.564 --> 16:50.031
OH, GOOD IDEA, LET'S.

16:50.033 --> 16:51.866
I SHOULDN'T BE
SEEING THIS!

16:51.868 --> 16:52.600
BLEHHH!

16:52.602 --> 16:54.803
IS THERE A PROBLEM,
YOUNG MAN?

16:54.805 --> 16:56.437
NO PROBLEM.

16:58.942 --> 17:03.011
I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU,
YOU WERE MY BEST FRIEND
AFTER STAN.

17:03.013 --> 17:04.979
COME ON,
IT'S TIME TO GO.

17:04.981 --> 17:08.116
CHEF, DOES POO
GO TO HEAVEN?

17:08.485 --> 17:10.485
WELL, I KINDA
HOPE NOT.

17:10.487 --> 17:11.619
( crying )

17:11.621 --> 17:12.954
I MEAN,
SURE IT DOES,

17:12.956 --> 17:15.623
HERE, I'LL GIVE HIM
ONE OF MY SALTY BALLS,

17:15.625 --> 17:18.626
TO TAKE WITH HIM
TO POO HEAVEN.

17:20.931 --> 17:23.331
COME ON, LET'S GO.

17:23.333 --> 17:25.400
Kyle...

17:25.402 --> 17:26.367
MR. HANKEY?

17:26.369 --> 17:28.837
Howdy...ho...

17:28.839 --> 17:30.505
HE'S BACK,
HE'S BACK!

17:30.507 --> 17:31.506
THAT WAS DELICIOUS!

17:31.508 --> 17:35.443
MY SALTY CHOCOLATE BALLS
MUST HAVE REJUVENATED HIM!

17:35.445 --> 17:38.046
YOU GOT THE BEST BALLS
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

17:38.048 --> 17:44.052
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT.

17:44.054 --> 17:46.921
STEP ON UP AND GET
"MR. HANKEY AND ME" T-SHIRTS!

17:46.923 --> 17:51.226
GET THEM WHILE THEY LAST FOLKS,
ONLY $14.95!

17:51.228 --> 17:52.460
I'LL TAKE TWO.

17:52.462 --> 17:53.661
SELLING T-SHIRTS
KICKS ASS.

17:53.663 --> 17:59.334
I'M PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE
ON THIS GALA OPENING OF
"HOLLYWOOD PLANET SOUTH PARK",

17:59.336 --> 18:01.369
THAT THE FESTIVAL
WILL BE BACK NEXT YEAR,

18:01.371 --> 18:05.607
AND THE YEAR AFTER THAT,
AND THE YEAR AFTER THAT,
AND SO ON.

18:05.609 --> 18:07.442
RELEASE THE CURTAIN!

18:07.444 --> 18:12.714
I GIVE YOU:
HOLLYWOOD IN SOUTH PARK,
HA HA HA!

18:12.716 --> 18:15.717
WAIT, I BROUGHT HIM
TO SHOW YOU!

18:15.719 --> 18:16.918
NOT THIS AGAIN.

18:16.920 --> 18:18.820
BEHOLD,
MR. HANKEY!

18:18.822 --> 18:23.858
HOOOOWDY HO!

18:25.161 --> 18:27.695
ANYWAY,
THIS NEW "HOLLYWOOD PLANET",

18:27.697 --> 18:29.130
WILL BE THE OFFICIAL
MEETING PLACE--

18:29.132 --> 18:32.400
HOWDY HO, FOLKS,
I'M AFRAID MY BUDDY WAS RIGHT,

18:32.402 --> 18:36.771
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ROOM
IN "SOUTH PARK"
TO ACCOMMODATE A FESTIVAL.

18:36.773 --> 18:40.441
MR. POO, IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND,
WE CAN'T HEAR.

18:40.443 --> 18:41.976
IF YOU CAN JUST
TURN YOURSELF DOWN,

18:41.978 --> 18:46.581
YOU'RE AT ABOUT 7 RIGHT NOW,
WE NEED YOU AT 3, O.K.?

18:47.784 --> 18:48.983
AW, FOLKS, PLEASE.

18:48.985 --> 18:51.986
LITTLE TOWNS SIMPLY AREN'T
MEANT FOR BIG EVENTS.

18:51.988 --> 18:58.459
WE LOVE HAVING VISITORS,
BUT GOD, TOO MANY OF YA
IS HURTING MY ECOSYSTEM.

18:58.461 --> 19:00.728
BESIDES, FILM FESTIVALS
SHOULDN'T BE ABOUT

19:00.730 --> 19:05.333
WHAT CELEBRITIES ARE COMING,
OR WHAT FILM IS GONNA GET SHOWN,

19:05.335 --> 19:09.337
IT SHOULD BE ABOUT PEOPLE
GETTIN' TOGETHER,
AND WATCHIN' MOVIES,

19:09.339 --> 19:12.640
AND ABOUT PEOPLE WHO COULD NEVER
GET THEIR MOVIE SEEN,

19:12.642 --> 19:15.176
HAVIN' A CHANCE
TO HAVE IT WATCHED.

19:15.178 --> 19:16.177
IF ONLY ONCE.

19:16.179 --> 19:19.180
A GOOD FILM FESTIVAL
SHOULD BE SOMETHING
WHERE YA'LL SAY,

19:19.182 --> 19:26.587
"LET'S FORGET ABOUT LAWYERS,
AND AGENTS AND STUDIOS
AND CELEBRITIES FOR A WHILE,

19:26.589 --> 19:30.224
"AND JUST WATCH
SOME NEW ART."

19:32.195 --> 19:35.330
I...HAVE HAD ENOUGH
OF YOU!

19:35.332 --> 19:37.332
AHH!
NO!

19:37.334 --> 19:42.103
AS I WAS SAYING, THIS SHALL
USHER IN A WHOLE NEW DECADE
OF FILM...

19:42.105 --> 19:45.039
OH, HE'S DEAD,
MR. HANKEY'S DEAD!

19:45.041 --> 19:48.509
WELL, THIS WORKED
ONCE BEFORE.

19:51.948 --> 19:52.914
THANKS, CHEF.

19:52.916 --> 19:56.884
YOUR BIG CHOCOLATE BALLS
ARE JUST THE TRICK.

20:01.291 --> 20:03.491
WHAT THE HELL
IS HE DOING?

20:04.894 --> 20:09.364
( magical music playing )

20:10.400 --> 20:11.833
WOW!

20:21.144 --> 20:22.844
OH, MY GOD!

20:26.716 --> 20:28.583
NO! AH!

20:30.420 --> 20:32.086
AAHHH!

20:34.057 --> 20:36.424
OH, MY GOD,
AHHH!

20:36.426 --> 20:38.026
IT SMELLS,
IT SMELLS!

20:38.028 --> 20:41.295
COME ON,
THE POO IS COMING!!

20:41.297 --> 20:43.197
I'M TRYING, DAMMIT!

20:55.345 --> 20:57.712
LET'S GET OUT
OF THIS TOWN!

21:04.120 --> 21:05.553
WHOO!

21:07.223 --> 21:11.692
GOSH, I GUESS I DON'T
KNOW MY OWN STRENGTH.

21:11.961 --> 21:15.063
YOU DID IT,
YOU GOT RID OF
ALL THE FILM PEOPLE.

21:15.065 --> 21:16.097
HOORAY. HOORAY.

21:16.099 --> 21:20.435
NOW ALL WE HAVE IS A TOWN
COVERED IN SH-- ( bleep!),
THIS IS MUCH BETTER.

21:20.437 --> 21:24.505
I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
WITHOUT YOU, KYLE.

21:24.507 --> 21:25.973
KISSES.

21:26.643 --> 21:30.511
I'M SORRY I DRAGGED YOU TO
ALL THOSE INDEPENDENT FILMS.

21:30.513 --> 21:32.080
THAT'S O.K., WENDY.

21:32.082 --> 21:33.247
SOMETIMES
I FORGET THAT,

21:33.249 --> 21:35.783
EVEN THOUGH A FEW
INDEPENDENT FILMS ARE GREAT,

21:35.785 --> 21:37.285
MOST OF THEM
SUCK ASS.

21:37.287 --> 21:39.253
AND I'VE LEARNED
SOMETHING TOO.

21:39.255 --> 21:43.157
BEING A SELL-OUT IS SWEET,
BECAUSE YOU MAKE A LOT OF MONEY,

21:43.159 --> 21:44.225
AND WHEN YOU HAVE MONEY,

21:44.227 --> 21:48.429
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HANG OUT
WITH PO'-ASS LOSERS, LIKE YOU.

21:48.431 --> 21:51.365
SCREW YOU GUYS,
I'M GOIN' HOME.

21:51.534 --> 21:55.369

CHOCOLATE SALTY BALLS ♪
