went off to tell a story.

01:43.229 --> 01:46.482
And then, that's exactly
what she did do, that.

01:46.566 --> 01:49.319

The end.

01:51.863 --> 01:52.822
Yes, Albert?

01:52.905 --> 01:54.574
That story was bad.

01:54.699 --> 01:56.200

really a question.

really a story.

better story and come back again.
