02:11.064 --> 02:14.701
- YEAH, LOOKS LIKE IT.

02:14.734 --> 02:16.703

- WELL, I MEAN,
I'VE WATCHED, LIKE,

02:18.071 --> 02:20.206

03:54.200 --> 03:55.368

03:55.402 --> 03:57.504
IN THE CONTRACT,
I'LL COME AND TRAIN BOTH OF YOU.

04:01.441 --> 04:05.812

04:05.845 --> 04:07.914
- THAT LADY DIDN'T END UP
BUYING THE APARTMENT,

04:07.947 --> 04:11.618
BUT SHE TAUGHT ME ONE THING,
WHICH IS HOW TO TWERK.

04:11.651 --> 04:15.221
DO YOU WANT TO SEE ME TWERKING?

04:15.255 --> 04:17.590
[grunting]

04:20.593 --> 04:22.429
- NO, IT IS.
THAT'S HOW YOU TWERK.

04:22.462 --> 04:25.498
I SAW IT
IN A MILEY CYRUS CONCERT.

04:25.532 --> 04:28.335
THAT'S HOW YOU TWERK.

04:28.368 --> 04:29.736
- IN THE WORLD OF REAL ESTATE,

04:29.769 --> 04:33.340
IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK
YOUR BEST AT ALL TIMES,

04:33.373 --> 04:35.342
AND IN NEW YORK
IN THE SUMMERS,

04:35.375 --> 04:38.611
IT CAN GET
UP TO OVER 100 DEGREES,

04:38.645 --> 04:40.814
SO I HAVE TO FIND WAYS
TO STAY COOL

04:40.847 --> 04:43.883
AND LOOK COOL
AT THE SAME TIME.

04:45.985 --> 04:47.654
- [gasps]
- WHAT THE--

04:47.687 --> 04:49.289

04:51.391 --> 04:53.460

04:56.329 --> 04:57.797
- DO YOU THINK SO?
- YEAH, IT'S GREAT.

04:57.831 --> 05:00.700
- I DON'T THINK ANYONE'S EVER
OWNED ORANGE LIKE YOU.

05:00.734 --> 05:04.471
- DO YOU THINK I NEED COLOR
ON MY LEGS?

05:04.504 --> 05:06.206
- YEAH, YOU SHOULD
HAVE A TANNING BUDGET

05:06.239 --> 05:08.375
AND PROBABLY WAXED AS WELL.

05:08.408 --> 05:09.843
- STOP DOING THAT.

05:09.876 --> 05:12.512
- DON'T STAND THAT WAY.
THAT'S NOT HOW PEOPLE STAND.

05:12.545 --> 05:13.680
- LIKE THIS?

05:13.713 --> 05:15.382
UM, YES.

05:15.415 --> 05:18.184

05:22.789 --> 05:24.457
- I DON'T CARE
HOW HOT IT GETS.

05:24.491 --> 05:26.926
I LOVE TO WEAR A SUIT,
AND I WILL WEAR IT.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.896
AND I--
I DON'T SWEAT THAT MUCH.

05:29.929 --> 05:32.465
I ACTUALLY DON'T.

05:32.499 --> 05:33.566
- LISTEN.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.201
- YES?
- COME ON, IT'S SUMMERTIME.

05:35.235 --> 05:36.903
- WE'RE NOT--
I'M NOT GONNA DO SUMMER LOOKS.

05:36.936 --> 05:39.272

YOU HAVE TO.

05:39.305 --> 05:40.707

05:40.740 --> 05:41.975
- NO, IT'S NOT IN THE MIND.
- YES, IT IS IN THE MIND.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.610

IT IS IN THE SUN.

05:43.643 --> 05:45.945
AND IT'S 90 DEGREES.
LET'S TRY SOME LOOKS.

05:45.979 --> 05:47.347
LET'S SEE HOW IT GOES.

05:47.380 --> 05:48.848

05:48.882 --> 05:52.085
- OKAY.

05:52.118 --> 05:53.720
- DEFINITELY I CANNOT
PULL DENIM SHIRTS.

05:53.753 --> 05:55.522
- OF COURSE YOU CAN.
IT'S JUST SUMMER.

05:55.555 --> 05:57.791
IT'S A FUN TIME.

05:57.824 --> 06:00.060

06:12.072 --> 06:14.040

NOBODY'S TOUCHING MY HAIR.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.842
THAT'S FOR SURE.
NO, NO.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.811
- TRY THIS JACKET ON.
TRY THIS JACKET ON.

06:17.844 --> 06:19.379
- WHAT IS THAT, A--
NO, I'M NOT DOING A BOW TIE.

06:19.412 --> 06:21.548
- YES, OF COURSE,
LET'S DO A BOW TIE.

06:21.581 --> 06:23.049
- YOU JUST DECIDED
YOU JUST WANTED TO [bleep]

06:23.049 --> 06:24.050

06:24.084 --> 06:25.652
- NO, MAN, I WAS
A LITTLE BORED TODAY,

06:25.685 --> 06:30.557
BUT YOU ACTUALLY LOOK AMAZING.

06:30.590 --> 06:32.592
- OKAY, MAYBE, MAYBE, MAYBE.

06:32.625 --> 06:33.593
YOU KNOW WHAT, IAN?

06:33.626 --> 06:35.562

06:38.698 --> 06:40.133

OKAY, OKAY, I DON'T THINK
I LIKE THAT THAT MUCH.

07:02.689 --> 07:04.357
[laughs]

07:04.391 --> 07:06.026
I WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO DO THAT, BUT I DID IT.

07:06.059 --> 07:08.595
[bleep] IT.

07:08.628 --> 07:10.864
- I GO TO SUIT STORES
ALL THE TIME,

07:10.897 --> 07:12.198
AND THERE'S, LIKE,
GRAY, BLUE, BLACK.

07:12.232 --> 07:13.466
IT'S SO BORING.

07:13.500 --> 07:16.202
I LIKE TO POP A COLOR,
ESPECIALLY IN THE SUMMER.

07:16.236 --> 07:19.039
FASHION IN NEW YORK
IS ALL ABOUT POPPING A PASTEL.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.874
[phone rings]

07:20.907 --> 07:22.842
- SO YOU'VE GOT THE BEAUTIFUL
DUSTED ROSE COLOR HERE.

07:22.876 --> 07:24.310

07:24.344 --> 07:26.446
- CLASSIC FREDRIK EKLUND.
- YEAH, OKAY, LET'S TRY IT ON.

07:26.479 --> 07:27.947

07:28.048 --> 07:29.683
SO WE'VE GOT THE MOHAIR FABRIC,

07:29.716 --> 07:32.519
WHICH IS A VERY VINTAGE,
CLASSIC, ELEGANT LOOK.

07:32.552 --> 07:33.720
- YEAH.

07:33.753 --> 07:35.822
- THE BEAUTIFUL PEARL BUTTONS
ON THE JACKET

07:35.855 --> 07:37.757
THAT ARE REALLY
GONNA HARMONIZE WELL.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.293
- IT FEELS
A LITTLE, LIKE, 1980s.

07:40.326 --> 07:42.629

07:42.662 --> 07:44.097

07:44.130 --> 07:45.465
OKAY, LET'S MEASURE.
I NEED PANTS.

07:45.498 --> 07:46.599
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING,
THE SAME COLOR?

07:46.633 --> 07:49.703
- SAME COLOR, VERY TAILORED,
VERY FITTED,

07:49.736 --> 07:50.704
LITTLE BIT OF A CUFF.

07:50.737 --> 07:53.573
- OKAY, I HAVE VERY LONG LEGS.

07:53.606 --> 07:55.141
I WOULD BE
A GREAT SWEDISH SUPERMODEL.

07:55.175 --> 07:56.409
OOH.

07:56.443 --> 07:58.345
OKAY, WHAT ABOUT HIM?
HE CAN'T LOOK LIKE THIS.

07:58.378 --> 07:59.612
- WE'VE GOT TO GET HIM MEASURED.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.715
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT.
- WE GOT TO DO IT.

08:01.748 --> 08:03.249
- THAT'S SOME HAIRY LEGS
YOU GOT THERE.

08:03.283 --> 08:05.018
- WELL, SO DO YOU.
- [laughs]

08:05.018 --> 08:07.754
- DEREK THINKS I HAVE, LIKE,
THE PERFECT AMOUNT OF HAIR.

08:07.787 --> 08:09.656
- OH, HMM.

08:09.689 --> 08:12.625
- HE NEEDS TO LOOK MORE LIKE,
YOU KNOW, <i>DOWNTON ABBEY.</i>

08:12.659 --> 08:15.528
LIKE, I LIVE UPSTAIRS.
HE WORKS DOWNSTAIRS.

08:15.562 --> 08:17.430
- OKAY.
- THANK YOU.

08:17.464 --> 08:20.266
JORDAN, LET'S GET BACK TO WORK.
PUT SOME PANTS ON.

08:20.300 --> 08:24.371
- I'M NOT SURE
WHERE THEY ARE NOW.

08:24.404 --> 08:26.439
- REAL ESTATE
CAN BE VERY EXCITING,

08:26.473 --> 08:29.175
BUT IT CAN ALSO
BE VERY STRESSFUL.

08:29.209 --> 08:32.846
AND SOMETIMES YOU GOT TO FIND
A WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT STRESS.

08:36.049 --> 08:39.486
- IT IS NOT TOO EXPENSIVE.

08:39.519 --> 08:40.954
OKAY, THANK YOU.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.288
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND,
LET ME KNOW.

08:42.322 --> 08:46.226
OH, YES, MMM.

08:46.259 --> 08:48.194
- IS THAT A POP-TART?

08:48.228 --> 08:49.729
HEY.
[knocking on glass]

08:49.763 --> 08:51.431
IS THAT A POP-TART?

08:51.464 --> 08:52.866
- NO.

08:52.899 --> 08:56.703
- I HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN YOU
EAT A CARB BEFORE.

08:56.736 --> 08:58.705
ARE YOU CRAZY?
ARE YOU LOSING YOUR MIND?

08:58.738 --> 09:01.241
- LEAVE ME ALONE PLEASE.

09:05.812 --> 09:07.080
- LET'S NOT EAT YOUR FEELINGS,
OKAY?

09:07.113 --> 09:10.650
YOU'RE NOT A GIRL
HAVING HER PERIOD, COME ON.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.018
I'M SERIOUS.
I USED--

09:12.052 --> 09:16.389
I'VE BEEN THERE.
I'VE DONE THAT.

09:16.423 --> 09:19.592
I CAN STILL SEE YOU.
I CAN STILL SEE YOU.

09:19.626 --> 09:20.760
- CAN'T HEAR YOU.

09:20.794 --> 09:23.296
- OH, MY GOD.

09:23.329 --> 09:24.497
- NOW I GOT CHOCOLATE
ON MY SHIRT.

09:24.531 --> 09:25.932
MOTHER[bleep].

09:28.101 --> 09:29.302
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN STRESS EAT?

09:29.336 --> 09:32.372
STRESS EAT LIKE IN,
YOU GET STRESSED AND EAT?

09:32.405 --> 09:35.175
- I DON'T REALLY USE FOOD
TO DE-STRESS,

09:35.208 --> 09:39.179
BUT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO.

09:39.212 --> 09:43.616
- NO, YOU GET STRESSED,
AND YOU DRINK...WHISKEY.

09:47.854 --> 09:50.056
- OH, THERE'S STILL
CHOCOLATE FUDGE ON TOP.

09:50.090 --> 09:54.361
- MMM, ALL RIGHT.

09:54.394 --> 09:55.829
- OW.
OH, MY GOD.

09:55.862 --> 09:58.198
- OH, I FEEL SO SICK NOW.

10:00.166 --> 10:01.301
- HOLY [bleep].

10:01.334 --> 10:04.104
I AM DRUNK, YES.
[laughs]

10:05.238 --> 10:09.142
all: * SANTA LUCIA *
- FURTHER DOWN.

10:09.175 --> 10:10.910
- IS THIS IT?
- IS IT WHAT?

10:10.944 --> 10:11.911
- I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS GOING
TO GET HERE SO SOON.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.780
- IS IT WHAT?
- [gasps]

10:13.813 --> 10:17.150
[camera snapping]
YES!

10:17.183 --> 10:19.719
THIS IS THE MOST AWESOME--
OH, JESUS.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.326
- A REALLY GOOD PART
ABOUT CLOSING A DEAL

10:26.359 --> 10:27.460
IS THE COMMISSION CHECK
THAT COMES ALONG.

10:27.494 --> 10:28.762
- YOU GOT A DEAL.

10:28.795 --> 10:29.896
- WE'RE GONNA DO A DEAL.
- WE'RE DOING THIS?

10:29.929 --> 10:30.930
- YOU'RE GONNA
GET YOUR [bleep] DEAL.

10:30.964 --> 10:31.931
- OH, MY GOD.
- AWESOME.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.066
- * LA LA LA LA LA *

10:33.099 --> 10:36.369
- BUT FIGURING OUT
HOW TO SPEND IT,

10:36.403 --> 10:39.072
IT CAN BE A LITTLE TRICKY.

10:39.105 --> 10:40.407
- DOMINGO?

10:40.440 --> 10:43.443
- THE FAMOUS DOMINGO ZAPATA,
HOW ARE YOU, SIR?

10:43.476 --> 10:44.678
- HOW ARE YOU, LUIS?
- WOW, WHAT AN HONOR, MAN.

10:44.711 --> 10:45.945
WHAT AN HONOR.
- THANK YOU.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.247
- WHAT A BEAUTIFUL PLACE.
- WELCOME. THANK YOU.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.015
- YOU KNOW, I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
A FAN OF YOUR WORK

10:49.049 --> 10:50.216
FOR A LONG TIME.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.651
I JUST HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO AFFORD IT.

10:51.685 --> 10:52.986
I THINK, UH--
- [laughs]

10:53.019 --> 10:54.554
- YOU KNOW, THIS YEAR
THINGS HAVE BEEN GREAT FOR ME,

10:54.587 --> 10:56.756
SO I THINK IT'S TIME
FOR ME TO START COLLECTING ART.

10:56.790 --> 10:59.926
- I'LL SHOW YOU
WHAT I HAVE HERE.

10:59.959 --> 11:02.228
THE POLO HORSES,
WHICH I'VE BEEN DOING

11:02.262 --> 11:03.630
FOR MANY, MANY YEARS.
- OKAY.

11:03.663 --> 11:06.933
AND THE PIECE HERE,
FOR EXAMPLE, THAT'S AVAILABLE.

11:06.966 --> 11:08.835
- IT'S BEAUTIFUL,
AND I FEEL LIKE

11:08.868 --> 11:10.070
IF IT'S GONNA BE THE FIRST TIME,

11:10.070 --> 11:11.371
IT NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING
THAT HAS A LITTLE BIT

11:11.404 --> 11:13.306
OF AN ESSENCE OF WHO I AM.
- OKAY.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.175
- I'M A GUY THAT'S, LIKE,
FULL OF LIFE.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.543
I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT ANYTHING.

11:16.576 --> 11:17.544
- RED, PASSION.

11:17.577 --> 11:19.312
- I'M A FIGHTER.
YES, YES, YES.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.313
- WELL, TWO THINGS THEN.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.716
FOR EXAMPLE, BULLFIGHTERS,

11:22.749 --> 11:24.551
AND BEING
THAT YOU ARE LATINO, MAYBE...

11:24.584 --> 11:25.652
- YES, YES.
- YOU KNOW?

11:25.685 --> 11:27.454
- THEN WE HAVE THIS ONE.

11:27.487 --> 11:29.456
- OH, MY GOD.

11:29.489 --> 11:30.824
THIS IS AMAZING.

11:30.857 --> 11:33.793
- IT'S ALMOST LIKE A FIGHT
BETWEEN GLORY AND DEATH.

11:33.827 --> 11:36.096
- THAT'S HOW I SEE LIFE.
- YEAH.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.131
- I LIKE THAT SO MUCH.
HOW MUCH IS THIS ONE?

11:38.164 --> 11:42.635
- THAT WOULD BE ABOUT 95,000.

11:42.669 --> 11:46.606
BUT--BUT YEAH, I MEAN,
I'LL GO DOWN A LITTLE BIT.

11:46.639 --> 11:48.274
YOU CAN PROBABLY HAVE THAT,
A PIECE LIKE THAT

11:48.308 --> 11:51.845
FOR ABOUT 65,000.

11:51.878 --> 11:54.647
JUST, YOU KNOW, THINK ABOUT IT
IF YOU WANT, AND I'LL SEE.

11:57.851 --> 11:59.285
- YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN DOING
A LITTLE BIT OF CHARITY,

11:59.319 --> 12:00.320
BUT IT'S NOT BEEN ENOUGH.

12:00.353 --> 12:02.455
WHO AM I, AND WHO ARE THEY?

12:02.489 --> 12:04.691
AND WHY IS THERE
SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE?

12:04.724 --> 12:06.693
- I MEAN, DO YOU WANT
TO GO INTO CLASSISM

12:06.726 --> 12:08.328
AND SOCIOECONOMICS?

12:08.361 --> 12:11.231
- WE NEED TO START
DEDICATING A SUM OF MONEY

12:11.264 --> 12:12.966
EVERY MONTH, LIKE,
ON THE CLOCK,

12:13.066 --> 12:14.467
GOING TO SOME
OF THESE CHARITIES.

12:14.501 --> 12:15.802
- LET'S DO A PERCENTAGE THEN.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

12:15.835 --> 12:17.570
- I THOUGHT FOR SO LONG,
FOR SO MANY YEARS

12:17.604 --> 12:19.472
THAT THERE WAS ONLY
TWO DRIVING FORCES,

12:19.506 --> 12:22.142
TRUE DRIVING FORCES
FOR A SUPER AGENT.

12:22.175 --> 12:25.879
IT WAS EGO OR MONEY,
BUT I REALIZED,

12:25.912 --> 12:29.649
THIS LAST YEAR ESPECIALLY,
THERE MIGHT BE A THIRD.

12:29.683 --> 12:32.786
IT'S DOING GOOD.

12:32.819 --> 12:34.788
I'VE TAKEN SO MUCH...
[grunts]

12:34.821 --> 12:36.823
NOW I WANT TO JUST GIVE BACK
A LITTLE BIT.

12:36.856 --> 12:40.660
- LIKE, YOUR SUSHI ORDER
EVERY DAY IS HOW MUCH?

12:40.694 --> 12:41.661
- I DON'T KNOW,
YOU ORDERED FOR ME.

12:41.695 --> 12:42.796
I NEVER ASKED FOR THE PRICE.

12:42.829 --> 12:44.497
- YEAH, I THINK
IT'S, LIKE, $50 A DAY.

12:44.531 --> 12:46.766
- THIS IS $50?
- YOU LIKE A LOT OF SUSHI.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.635
- HOW CAN THIS BE $50 A DAY?

12:48.668 --> 12:50.403
I THOUGHT SUSHI--
- DO YOU SEE THE COLOR ON THAT?

12:50.437 --> 12:53.239
THAT IS FRESH FROM THE OCEAN.
- OKAY, SO NO MORE SUSHI.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.642
- OKAY, WELL, THEN, I THINK
WE SHOULD JUST DO SACK LUNCHES.

12:55.675 --> 12:57.911
YEAH, WE CAN REALLOCATE
THE RESOURCES.

12:57.944 --> 13:01.948
365 TIMES 50
WOULD BE 50% OF 365,

13:02.048 --> 13:07.420
WHICH WOULD BE 182--
$18,250.

13:07.454 --> 13:08.722
- $20,000 A YEAR?
OKAY, SO THAT'S WHERE--

13:08.755 --> 13:09.923
- IF MY MATH IS RIGHT
IN MY HEAD.

13:09.956 --> 13:10.924
- THAT'S WHERE
WE'RE GONNA START.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.192
- I'M NOT A MATH MAJOR.

13:12.225 --> 13:13.293
- THAT'S WHERE
WE'RE GONNA START WIRING

13:13.326 --> 13:14.694
TO ZIMBABWE'S
FORGOTTEN CHILDREN.

13:14.728 --> 13:15.695
YOU HAVE THE WIRING INFORMATION.

13:15.729 --> 13:17.364
- OKAY, SO CONFIRM IT.

13:17.397 --> 13:20.600
- YEAH, JUST--AND COPY ME ON IT.
THANK YOU.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.439
- I MEAN, I REALLY--
I REALLY LIKE THIS PIECE A LOT.

13:26.473 --> 13:27.874
WHAT WAS THE PRICE
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE ME?

13:27.907 --> 13:32.746
- I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU
FOR 65,000.

13:32.779 --> 13:34.514
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:34.547 --> 13:36.850
UM, THIS IS THE PAINTING I WANT.

13:36.883 --> 13:38.485
DONE DEAL.
- [laughs]

13:38.518 --> 13:39.586
IT'S ALL YOURS.

13:39.619 --> 13:41.354
- I'M, LIKE--
I HAVE GOOSE BUMPS, MAN.

13:41.388 --> 13:42.756
LET'S GO--LET ME WRITE
THAT CHECK WITH YOU.

13:42.789 --> 13:44.090
- OKAY.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.494
- GOOD MORNING.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.429
HERE'S SOME PACKAGE
THAT CAME FOR YOU.

13:49.462 --> 13:50.897
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT IS.

13:50.930 --> 13:52.098
- OH, MY GOD.

13:52.098 --> 13:54.768
IS THIS--IS THIS IT?
- IS IT--IS IT WHAT?

13:54.801 --> 13:55.769
- I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS
GONNA GET HERE SO SOON.

13:55.802 --> 13:57.237
- IS IT WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU--

13:57.270 --> 13:58.271
- YES.
- WHAT IS THIS?

13:58.304 --> 13:59.873
WHAT ARE YOU SO EXCITED ABOUT?

13:59.906 --> 14:02.042
- OH, MY GOD,
I TOTALLY RUSH-DELIVERED IT,

14:02.042 --> 14:04.210
AND IT TOTALLY SHOWED UP.
[gasps]

14:04.244 --> 14:06.713
OKAY, SO I THINK
YOU GO LIKE THIS.

14:06.746 --> 14:10.817
YES, YES.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.886
NOW I CAN TAKE PHOTOS
OF MYSELF FROM REALLY FAR AWAY,

14:12.919 --> 14:14.587
SO IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
I'M TAKING MY OWN SELFIE.

14:14.621 --> 14:16.823
I CAN BE LIKE,
"OH, OH, WHAT'S GOING ON?"

14:16.856 --> 14:18.258
"OH, NOTHING."
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

14:18.291 --> 14:20.593
IT'S A SELFIE STICK.
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

14:20.627 --> 14:21.661
- NO, IT'S NOT RIDICULOUS, OKAY?

14:21.695 --> 14:22.662
YOU KNOW WHAT'S RIDICULOUS?

14:22.696 --> 14:26.066
- IT'S A TAD RIDICULOUS.

14:26.099 --> 14:28.335
- OKAY, READY, READY, READY?

14:28.368 --> 14:29.402
[camera snapping]

14:29.436 --> 14:31.504
IT WORKED, IT WORKED,
OH, MY GOD!

14:31.538 --> 14:32.505
YES, IT WORKED!

14:32.539 --> 14:33.506
DID YOU SEE THAT?

14:33.540 --> 14:35.642
[camera snapping]
YES, YES.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.744
[camera snapping]

14:37.777 --> 14:38.945
BAM, I JUST TOOK
A PHOTO OF YOU,

14:38.978 --> 14:39.946
AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I WAS DOING.

14:39.979 --> 14:41.514
BAM, DID YOU SEE THAT?

14:41.548 --> 14:43.550
I'M--
[laughs]

14:43.583 --> 14:45.785
- YOU'RE ACTING LIKE
A 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL RIGHT NOW.

14:45.819 --> 14:48.221
- OH, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

14:48.254 --> 14:50.757
WAIT, HERE IT IS.
READY?

14:50.790 --> 14:53.660
READY?

14:53.693 --> 14:55.161
OKAY.

14:55.195 --> 14:57.230
YOLANDA.
- WHAT IS TH--

14:57.263 --> 14:59.733
[camera snapping]
- BAM, I JUST GOT YOU.

14:59.766 --> 15:00.934
YOU SEE ME?

15:01.034 --> 15:02.902
SMILE. AHH.
[camera snapping]

15:02.936 --> 15:05.438
ANOTHER ONE FOR SAFETY.
[camera snapping]

15:05.472 --> 15:09.042
THIS IS THE MOST AWESOME--
OH, JESUS.

15:09.042 --> 15:11.044
HELP.

15:13.046 --> 15:16.049
[camera snapping]

15:16.049 --> 15:18.551
- SO THIS IS EXCITING FOR ME,
BECAUSE IT'S THE FIRST TIME

15:18.585 --> 15:22.622
I GET TO SHOW YOU
A REAL SWEDISH LUCIA TRADITION.

15:22.655 --> 15:25.925
ONE OF MY FAVORITE SWEDISH
TRADITIONS IS SANTA LUCIA,

15:25.959 --> 15:31.598
WHERE WE CELEBRATE LIGHT
IN THE MIDST OF DARK WINTER.

15:31.631 --> 15:35.702
I USUALLY DON'T CELEBRATE IT
IN THE UNITED STATES SO MUCH,

15:35.735 --> 15:37.804
BUT I MISS MY FAMILY A LOT
IN SWEDEN,

15:37.837 --> 15:41.374
SO I THOUGHT I'D PARTNER UP
WITH A SWEDISH ORGANIZATION

15:41.408 --> 15:42.909
AND THROW A PARTY.

15:42.942 --> 15:47.080
DANCING, DRINKING, AND SINGING.

15:47.080 --> 15:51.618
HELLO, OR AS WE SAY IN SWEDISH,
[speaks Swedish].

15:51.651 --> 15:54.621
I WANTED TO THANK YOU ALL
FOR COMING.

15:54.654 --> 15:58.658
THIS IS THE BIGGEST TRADITION
THAT WE HAVE IN SWEDEN,

15:58.692 --> 16:00.026
WHERE I'M FROM, BECAUSE,
YOU KNOW,

16:00.026 --> 16:03.930
IN SWEDEN, THE WINTERS ARE
VERY LONG AND VERY DARK.

16:04.030 --> 16:06.599
SO WE SORT OF PRAY
TO THE SAINT OF LUCIA,

16:06.633 --> 16:10.503
AND WE DRINK VODKA,
AND WE SING SWEDISH SONGS.

16:10.537 --> 16:13.039
AS A LITTLE BOY IN SWEDEN,
7:00 A.M.,

16:13.039 --> 16:15.308
I USED TO LOOK FORWARD
TO THIS EVENT ALL YEAR.

16:15.342 --> 16:18.311
AND 7:00 A.M. PITCH-DARK,
BLACK OUTSIDE,

16:18.345 --> 16:20.080
WE USED TO SEE
WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE.

16:20.113 --> 16:22.282
OKAY, SO WE'RE GONNA
DO A LITTLE PERFORMANCE.

16:22.315 --> 16:26.820
[all cheering]

16:26.853 --> 16:29.556
[all singing in Swedish]

16:29.589 --> 16:33.059
OKAY, WAIT A MINUTE.

16:33.059 --> 16:36.796
* *

16:38.064 --> 16:39.332
- MM-HMM.

16:39.366 --> 16:42.335
- WE HAVE TO HURRY.
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.

16:42.369 --> 16:43.670
WAIT, I NEED A THING HERE.

16:43.703 --> 16:45.705
WHO'S GONNA LIT MY CANDLES?

16:45.739 --> 16:49.843
all: * SANTA LUCIA *
- FURTHER DOWN.

16:49.876 --> 16:51.411
- WE'RE READY,
WE'RE READY, WE'RE READY.

16:51.444 --> 16:53.213
OKAY, LET'S DO THIS, GUYS.
COME ON, LET'S GO UP.

16:53.246 --> 16:56.216
[all singing in Swedish]

16:56.249 --> 17:04.591
* *

17:04.624 --> 17:07.460
OW, THAT HURTS.

17:07.494 --> 17:09.095
OH!

17:09.129 --> 17:11.431
UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME,
I HADN'T PLANNED

17:11.464 --> 17:13.400
ON THE HOT DRIPPING WAX.

17:13.433 --> 17:18.038
AH, OW, OW.

17:18.038 --> 17:20.373
OW. OW.

17:20.407 --> 17:23.877
* *

17:23.910 --> 17:26.780
OW.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.848
AH.

17:28.882 --> 17:30.517
THANK YOU!

17:30.550 --> 17:31.885
[crowd cheering]

17:31.918 --> 17:33.119
WHOO!

17:33.153 --> 17:34.754
OW!

17:34.788 --> 17:37.724
NEXT TIME, I'LL BE
A LITTLE BIT MORE PREPARED

17:37.757 --> 17:39.125
FOR THE HOT DRIPPING WAX.

17:39.159 --> 17:41.494
THAT PART, MM-MM,
NOT SO FUN.

17:41.528 --> 17:45.432
UNLESS IT'S ON A SATURDAY NIGHT,
IT'S NOT THAT FUN.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.934
- MY MOST IMPORTANT CLIENT
THIS YEAR BY FAR

17:47.967 --> 17:49.369
IS JANET FROM 30 LINCOLN.

17:49.402 --> 17:52.739
SHE SHOWED INCREDIBLE FAITH
IN ME BY GIVING ME A LISTING

17:52.772 --> 17:56.076
IN HER BUILDING
NOT ONCE, BUT TWICE.

17:58.712 --> 18:00.647
AND I WANTED TO REPAY HER.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.350
HOW ARE YOU, MY LOVE?
THIS IS WONDERFUL.

18:03.383 --> 18:05.385
- YES, I'M SO GLAD
YOU COULD JOIN US.

18:05.418 --> 18:06.386
- IT'S A PLEASURE.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.021
AND I BROUGHT A FRIEND.

18:08.054 --> 18:09.089
- HI.
- READY FOR SOME PICTURES?

18:09.122 --> 18:10.256
- ALWAYS.

18:10.290 --> 18:11.791
- JANET INVITED ME TO BE
A PART OF HER CHARITY,

18:11.825 --> 18:14.060
ANGELS IN AFRICA,
AND MY PARTICIPATION IN IT

18:14.094 --> 18:16.796
IS TO BE AUCTIONED OFF
TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER

18:16.830 --> 18:17.831
FOR A DATE.

18:17.864 --> 18:20.133
- WHICH ONE OF YOU
IS WORTH MORE?

18:20.166 --> 18:22.035
- DEFINITELY MYSELF.
- I WEIGH MORE.

18:22.035 --> 18:23.103
- YOU WEIGH MORE?
- IT'S A WEIGHT THING.

18:23.136 --> 18:24.838
THERE'S MORE OF ME PHYSICALLY.

18:24.871 --> 18:26.473
- THE KICKER IS THAT I AM
GOING TO BE AUCTIONED OFF

18:26.506 --> 18:27.807
WITH RYAN AS WELL.

18:27.841 --> 18:29.442
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
LET'S SEE WHO'S THE WINNER

18:29.476 --> 18:30.510
IN THIS ONE HERE.

18:30.543 --> 18:34.214
- YEAH.

18:34.247 --> 18:35.315
SO ARE YOU GONNA BID
FOR US TONIGHT?

18:35.348 --> 18:36.349
- NO.
- NO?

18:36.383 --> 18:37.484
- I'M NOT GONNA BID ON YOU.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.652
- COME ON, HE PUTS OUT
LIKE A CHAMP.

18:39.686 --> 18:41.488
- I'M NERVOUS, A LITTLE BIT.

18:41.521 --> 18:44.691
I FEEL THAT, YOU KNOW,
RYAN IS MUCH TALLER THAN ME.

18:44.724 --> 18:46.826
- CAN YOU TAKE A PHOTO OF ME
AND MY LITTLE BROTHER?

18:46.860 --> 18:49.596
- RYAN IS A HANDSOME GUY,
BUT, LISTEN,

18:49.629 --> 18:52.432
I GOT EVERYTHING ELSE.
[laughs]

18:52.465 --> 18:53.767
I HOPE YOU LOSE.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.536
- BITCH.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.371

18:58.405 --> 19:01.041

HOW YOU ALWAYS GET DATES.

19:02.709 --> 19:05.111
- FIRST OFF, THANK YOU ALL
SO MUCH FOR COMING.

19:05.145 --> 19:08.081
THIS IS
AN ABSOLUTELY AMAZING TURNOUT.

19:08.114 --> 19:10.884
[cheers and applause]

19:10.917 --> 19:13.019
WHEN PEOPLE SAY,
HOW DO I DO THIS?

19:13.053 --> 19:16.122
WELL, ALL OF THE CREDIT
GOES TO YOU FOLKS.

19:16.156 --> 19:19.359
WE HAVE AN ENTIRE VILLAGE,
AND WE HAVE A SCHOOL

19:19.392 --> 19:23.029
THAT HAS 410 CHILDREN,

19:23.063 --> 19:25.231
WHICH IS AMAZING.

19:25.265 --> 19:29.302
OKAY, NOW

19:29.336 --> 19:30.804
OKAY, COME ON, GUYS.

19:36.710 --> 19:40.347
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO START
FIRST WITH LUIS.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.048
- I REALLY DON'T WANT
TO DISAPPOINT JANET.

19:42.048 --> 19:43.383
I AM HOPING THAT PEOPLE
BID ON ME

19:43.416 --> 19:44.951
LIKE THERE WAS NO TOMORROW.

19:45.051 --> 19:47.387
I DON'T KNOW,
1,000, 2,000, 3,000--

19:47.420 --> 19:48.755
I MEAN, COME ON,
IT'S FOR THE KIDS.

19:48.788 --> 19:52.592
- WHO WILL GIVE ME $100?

20:00.066 --> 20:03.803
SURELY THERE HAS TO BE
SOMEBODY IN THIS AUDIENCE.

20:09.609 --> 20:12.779

OH, THERE YOU GO.

4,000, $4,000.

21:12.172 --> 21:13.807

BEFORE I EVEN UNDERSTAND

21:13.840 --> 21:16.543
WHAT'S GOING ON, THERE WAS THESE
TWO GIRLS FIGHTING OVER ME.

21:16.576 --> 21:19.713
- 5,000, THEY'RE GOING
BACK AND FORTH HERE.

21:19.746 --> 21:21.247

21:21.281 --> 21:23.983
THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST THING
TO HAPPEN TO ME IN MY LIFE.

21:24.084 --> 21:26.152
- $9,000.

21:26.186 --> 21:28.955

I WAS WORTH THAT MUCH.

21:28.988 --> 21:33.827

21:33.860 --> 21:35.495
HERE'S WHAT I THINK
WE NEED TO DO.

21:35.528 --> 21:38.998
ARE YOU WILLING

21:39.099 --> 21:44.337

THAT'S 19,000, LET'S GO.

21:44.371 --> 21:46.806

WITH THE HIGHEST SINGLE BID,

22:44.931 --> 22:48.168
BUT I BEAT HIM

22:48.201 --> 22:50.337

I'M GOING TO PROM NEXT SUMMER,

23:35.582 --> 23:37.150
WHICH IS GREAT.

23:37.183 --> 23:39.519
YOU SAW ME PRACTICING
MY BALLROOM DANCING

23:39.552 --> 23:42.122
IN THE SEASON FINALE,
WHICH WAS AWESOME,

23:42.155 --> 23:46.159
BUT I'VE ALSO BEEN PRACTICING
MY FREESTYLE DANCING,

23:46.192 --> 23:48.428
SO I CAN FIT IN
WITH THE KIDS.

23:48.461 --> 23:50.930
[dramatic music]

23:50.964 --> 23:55.101
ALTHOUGH I AM THE PERFECT MALE
ATHLETIC SPECIMEN,

23:55.101 --> 23:58.371
THERE'S ONE THING
I HAVE NOT MASTERED.

23:58.405 --> 23:59.372
LET'S DO THIS.

23:59.406 --> 24:02.375
[dance music]

24:02.409 --> 24:05.378
* *

24:05.412 --> 24:06.946
NEVER REALLY WENT
TO SCHOOL DANCES.

24:07.047 --> 24:08.815
I MEAN, IMAGINE, LIKE,
A BANANA TRYING TO DANCE.

24:08.848 --> 24:15.488

YES, IT'S OPEN.

24:19.859 --> 24:21.061
IT'S OPEN.
IT'S OPEN.

24:21.061 --> 24:22.429
COME IN.
I WAS JUST WORKING OUT.

24:22.462 --> 24:24.397
- WHAT?

24:24.431 --> 24:26.066
- WHY ARE YOU SO SWEATY?

24:26.066 --> 24:27.667

24:27.701 --> 24:28.935
I WAS JUST DOING,
LIKE, PUSH-UPS,

24:28.968 --> 24:30.537
LIKE, PUSH-UPS AND SIT-UPS
AND ALL THAT STUFF.

24:30.570 --> 24:33.173
I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO DO
A LEGITIMATE SPORT.

24:35.742 --> 24:39.112
[whooping]
GO DOWN, GO DOWN.

24:39.145 --> 24:40.847
SPANKING THAT HORSE,
SPANKING IT.

24:40.880 --> 24:44.484
NOW, WE'RE, LIKE--
OH, WE'RE A LITTLE STAR, YEAH.

24:44.517 --> 24:47.520
- ONE OF MY FAVORITE AND MOST
SUCCESSFUL BROKERS OPEN

24:47.554 --> 24:51.458
THIS ENTIRE YEAR WAS
THE 16 WARREN GREEN OPEN HOUSE.

24:51.491 --> 24:54.394
EVERYTHING IS GREEN.
LOOK UP THERE, SOLAR PANELS.

24:54.427 --> 24:57.497
BUT WHAT YOU DIDN'T SEE
WAS ALL THE CRAP

24:57.530 --> 25:01.401
THAT JORDAN AND I HAD TO
GO THROUGH TO GET IT IN ORDER.

25:01.434 --> 25:02.569
AH!

25:02.602 --> 25:06.740
IT SMELLS GREEN
IN A WEIRD WAY.

25:09.409 --> 25:11.678
COWPOTS.

25:11.711 --> 25:13.646
- IS THIS MANURE?
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, MANURE?

25:13.680 --> 25:16.583
- POOP, COW POOP.
- LIKE MOUSEY'S POOP?

25:16.616 --> 25:19.085
- MM, A LITTLE BIT BIGGER
THAN MOUSEY'S.

25:19.119 --> 25:21.121
- EW.

25:21.154 --> 25:22.155
- [coughing]

25:22.188 --> 25:23.423
- OKAY, LET'S BUY THESE.

25:23.456 --> 25:25.425
THAT'S RECYCLABLE, FOR SURE.

25:25.458 --> 25:28.328
WHAT, THE WORM FACTORY?

25:28.361 --> 25:29.362
WAIT, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

25:29.396 --> 25:30.397
- OH, IS THIS FOR COMPOSTING?

25:30.430 --> 25:33.967
- WAIT, WHERE ARE THE WORMS?

25:34.067 --> 25:35.835
- WE'LL HAVE TO FIND SOME.

25:35.869 --> 25:38.571
- CAN YOU CALL RYAN SERHANT?

25:38.605 --> 25:40.206
DO YOU HAVE TOILET PAPER,
I'M THINKING?

25:40.240 --> 25:42.242
- YES, WE DO,
STRAIGHT UP THIS AISLE HERE.

25:42.275 --> 25:44.978
- OKAY.
HOW CAN TOILET PAPER BE GREEN?

25:45.078 --> 25:46.346
- IT'S PRECONSUMED PAPER.

25:46.379 --> 25:49.082
- RECYCLED POOP?

25:49.115 --> 25:50.483
IS IT USED?

25:50.517 --> 25:51.551
- SO BASICALLY, IT'S PAPER
THAT HASN'T MADE IT OUT

25:51.584 --> 25:52.919
TO CONSUMERS YET.

25:52.952 --> 25:55.088
- OH, THANK GOD.
THIS HAS TO BE PERFECT.

25:55.088 --> 25:58.525
OKAY, AND--
- OH!

25:58.558 --> 26:00.126
- OKAY, GREAT, HOW MUCH?

26:00.160 --> 26:03.763
- $345.95.

26:03.797 --> 26:05.231
- GREEN IS EXPENSIVE.

26:05.265 --> 26:07.200
I MEAN, CAN YOU IMAGINE
IF I STARTED CHARGING $49

26:07.233 --> 26:08.268
FOR MOUSEY'S POOP?

26:08.301 --> 26:10.804
I SHOULD OPEN
MY OWN GREEN DEPOT.

26:10.837 --> 26:12.105
WE'RE NOT GONNA USE THE CAR.

26:12.138 --> 26:13.873
- OKAY.
- WE'RE GONNA CARRY THIS.

26:13.907 --> 26:17.277
USING FUEL FROM NOW ON,
IT'S NOT GREEN.

26:17.310 --> 26:18.478
- THANK YOU.
- BYE!

26:18.511 --> 26:21.514
USE GREEN.

26:21.548 --> 26:23.783
- THERE ARE TWO THINGS
IN THIS LIFE THAT HAVE MY HEART,

26:23.817 --> 26:27.087
MY FAMILY AND NEW YORK CITY,
AND BEING ABLE TO GIVE

26:27.120 --> 26:32.392
MY PARENTS A PERSONAL TOUR
OF THE CITY THAT I LOVE SO MUCH

26:32.425 --> 26:35.862
WAS ONE OF THE HAPPIEST DAYS
IN MY LIFE.

26:35.895 --> 26:36.863
YOU SEE THAT PENTHOUSE
RIGHT THERE?

26:36.896 --> 26:38.064
- YEAH.

26:38.064 --> 26:39.366
- THIS BUILDING'S
CALLED 101 WARREN.

26:39.399 --> 26:41.534
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST
EXPENSIVE BUILDINGS IN TRIBECA.

26:41.568 --> 26:42.869
THEY'RE GOING RIGHT NOW
AT ABOUT 3,000,

26:42.902 --> 26:46.106
3,500, $4,000 PER SQUARE FOOT.

26:46.139 --> 26:47.741
- FOR YOUR NEXT OFFICE.

26:47.774 --> 26:49.843
- YEAH, THAT'S PROBABLY
GONNA BE MY GUESTHOUSE.

26:49.876 --> 26:51.411
[laughter]
- I HOPE!

26:54.080 --> 26:56.116
- THIS BUILDING RIGHT HERE,
95 WALL STREET...

26:56.149 --> 26:57.417
- 95 WALL STREET, YES.

26:57.450 --> 26:59.819
- WAS MY VERY FIRST APARTMENT
IN NEW YORK CITY.

26:59.853 --> 27:02.322
OH, IT'S THIS BUILDING
RIGHT HERE, PAPI, STRAIGHT UP.

27:02.355 --> 27:03.757
BUT THIS IS A STORY,
THIS IS A STORY.

27:03.790 --> 27:05.025
THE FIRST APARTMENT
THAT I SOLD

27:05.058 --> 27:08.461
WAS A SMALL, 450-SQUARE-FOOT
STUDIO FOR 2,800.

27:08.495 --> 27:10.196
SOON AS I CAME
TO THAT MODEL APARTMENT,

27:10.230 --> 27:13.133
IT SMELLED SO AMAZING,
IT SMELLED SO GOOD,

27:13.166 --> 27:15.802
THAT I FELT
THAT I ACTUALLY BELONGED THERE,

27:15.835 --> 27:17.470
SO I SAID,
"YOU KNOW WHAT, I'LL TAKE IT."

27:17.504 --> 27:19.839
BUT SINCE I COULDN'T AFFORD IT,
BECAUSE I HAD NO JOB,

27:19.873 --> 27:21.107
I HAD TO GO TO THE BANK.

27:21.141 --> 27:22.308
- NO JOB, NO MONEY?

27:22.342 --> 27:25.712
- NO MONEY,
AND I HAD TO GO TO THE BANK

27:25.745 --> 27:27.814
AND GET A LOAN
TO PAY FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS

27:27.847 --> 27:29.916
SO THAT THEY COULD ACTUALLY
ALLOW ME TO GO IN.

27:29.949 --> 27:31.785
I HAD TWO MONTHS
TO FIND MYSELF A JOB

27:31.818 --> 27:33.553
OR BACK INTO THE STREET
WITH NOTHING ELSE

27:33.586 --> 27:35.321
AND A BIG SIX MONTHS' DEBT.

27:35.355 --> 27:36.890
I DON'T GET TO SEE
MY FAMILY A LOT,

27:36.923 --> 27:39.559
SO THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW MUCH
ABOUT MY LIFE.

27:39.592 --> 27:43.463
SO I WANT TO BE ABLE TO BREAK
THAT MOM-AND-DAD RELATIONSHIP

27:43.496 --> 27:46.332
AND GIVE THEM A GLIMPSE
OF MY LIFE AS FRIENDS.

27:52.706 --> 27:53.707
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

27:53.740 --> 27:56.076
- YOU NEVER TOLD ME THAT.
- YEAH.

27:57.510 --> 28:00.113
- THE ONLY DEAL
THAT HE DID WAS ME.

28:00.146 --> 28:01.715
[laughter]

28:01.748 --> 28:03.750
- AND THEN SO FAR,
IT'S BEEN A GREAT DEAL,

28:03.783 --> 28:05.752
'CAUSE LOOK AT THE INVESTMENT.
- YEAH.

28:05.785 --> 28:08.254
- THIS IS MY SON.

28:11.057 --> 28:12.859
- <i>SALUD.</i>
<i>- SALUD.</i>

28:12.892 --> 28:15.128
MY FAVORITE PERSON THIS YEAR
WAS, HANDS DOWN, TODD.

28:15.161 --> 28:16.796
TELL ME ABOUT YOUR SON.
I NEVER MET YOUR BROTHER.

28:16.830 --> 28:19.699
- HE'S ONE
OF THE GREATEST ORIGAMI EXPERTS.

28:19.733 --> 28:22.102
HE WROTE A BOOK
ON EROTIC ORIGAMI.

28:22.135 --> 28:24.037
- [laughs]

28:27.574 --> 28:30.777
- RYAN, YOU GOT A LITTLE PACKAGE

28:30.810 --> 28:31.878
FROM ONE OF YOUR CLIENTS.

28:31.911 --> 28:33.046
- ONE OF THE BEST THINGS
ABOUT REAL ESTATE

28:33.046 --> 28:35.482
IS SOMETIMES PEOPLE
GET YOU GIFTS.

28:35.515 --> 28:36.583
ARE THEY, LIKE,
MULTICOLORED SALT SHAKERS?

28:36.616 --> 28:38.118
WHAT IS THIS?

28:38.151 --> 28:41.855
UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S NOT ALWAYS
CLEAR WHAT THOSE GIFTS ARE.

28:41.888 --> 28:42.922
WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO PEOPLE JUST, LIKE,

28:42.956 --> 28:44.457
SENDING CHAMPAGNE AND STUFF?

28:44.491 --> 28:47.427
DO YOU THINK IT'S A PUZZLE?

28:47.460 --> 28:48.795
IS THIS, LIKE,
A GAME FOR KIDS?

28:48.828 --> 28:50.597
- I GUESS WE'RE NOT SMART ENOUGH
TO FIGURE IT OUT.

28:50.630 --> 28:52.499
- MAYBE IT'S TO FIND OUT
IF YOU'RE COLOR-BLIND OR NOT.

28:52.532 --> 28:55.735
ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO ROLL,
YOU THINK, LIKE THIS?

28:55.769 --> 28:57.070
OH, THEY COULD BE, LIKE,
PLAYING THINGS,

28:57.070 --> 28:59.072
FOR MONKEYS AND STUFF.
- NO, THAT'S GONNA--

28:59.072 --> 29:00.340
- I DON'T KNOW.
YOU'RE NOT HELPFUL.

29:00.373 --> 29:01.608
YOLANDA.
- YEAH?

29:01.641 --> 29:02.609
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THESE ARE?

29:02.642 --> 29:04.010
ARE THESE FOR AN IPOD?

29:04.010 --> 29:05.745
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

29:05.779 --> 29:07.213
THEY'RE CANDLEHOLDERS.

29:07.247 --> 29:08.915
YOU PUT CANDLES IN THEM.

29:09.015 --> 29:10.016
- OH.

29:10.016 --> 29:11.618
- WHAT ELSE
WOULD YOU STICK IN THEM?

29:11.651 --> 29:14.921
- I MEAN,
IS THAT A SERIOUS QUESTION?

29:15.021 --> 29:17.157
CANDLES,
WHAT AM I GONNA DO WITH CANDLES?

29:17.190 --> 29:20.360
LISTEN, PEOPLE,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY ME GIFTS.

29:20.393 --> 29:23.029
BUT IF YOU DO,
JUST KNOW THAT I LIKE TIES,

29:23.063 --> 29:25.198
FINE WATCHES, AND SOCKS.

29:30.136 --> 29:31.838
- ONE OF MY FAVORITE LISTINGS
THIS YEAR WAS

29:31.871 --> 29:36.710
MY NEW DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
IN BRIDGEHAMPTON.

29:36.743 --> 29:38.845
NOW, DEREK AND I TOOK
A WEEKEND OFF TO EXPLORE

29:38.878 --> 29:42.115
THE AREA,
AND WE FOUND A LOCAL WINERY,

29:42.148 --> 29:44.351
AND THAT'S GREAT FOR ME,
BECAUSE I NEVER KNOW

29:44.384 --> 29:48.888
WHAT TO SERVE MY GUESTS
WHEN IT COMES TO WINE.

29:48.922 --> 29:50.490
HELLO, HI.
- HI THERE.

29:50.523 --> 29:52.359
- WELCOME
TO DUCK WALK VINEYARDS.

29:52.392 --> 29:53.660
- OKAY,
IT'S CALLED DUCK WALK?

29:53.693 --> 29:54.728
- DUCK WALK VINEYARDS.

29:54.761 --> 29:56.363
- WALK, WALK, WALK.
SO LET'S START.

29:56.396 --> 29:57.364
IT'S OKAY IF I TAKE NOTES?

29:57.397 --> 29:58.631
- ABSOLUTELY.

29:58.665 --> 30:00.166
THIS IS THE RESERVE CHARDONNAY.

30:00.200 --> 30:03.803
- A LITTLE BIT MORE.

30:03.837 --> 30:07.307
I'M NOT SURE I CAN TASTE IT
WHEN IT'S JUST A LITTLE.

30:07.340 --> 30:10.744
- IT'S A BLEND
OF CHARDONNAY AND CAYUGA.

30:10.777 --> 30:13.546
- WOW, I LIKE THIS.
THIS IS REALLY GOOD.

30:14.581 --> 30:17.517
- IT'D BE MY PLEASURE.

30:23.723 --> 30:25.125
- OKAY, NEXT, I'M READY.

30:25.158 --> 30:30.597
- YOU CAN--NO, RIGHT, POUR,
ACTUALLY POUR THAT INTO THE...

30:30.630 --> 30:32.632
- HE SAID POUR IT IN.

30:32.665 --> 30:34.467
- OKAY, I THINK
WE'RE READY FOR A RED.

30:34.501 --> 30:36.202
- THE MERLOT.
- OH, MERLOT.

30:36.236 --> 30:39.839
- YOU CAN SERVE IT WITH
A NICE CUT OF PORTERHOUSE STEAK

30:39.873 --> 30:41.274
OR FILET MIGNON.

30:41.307 --> 30:43.143
- WOW.
- THIS IS SO GOOD.

30:43.176 --> 30:44.644
- GOD, I'M REALLY STARTING
TO FEEL IT.

30:44.678 --> 30:46.279
DO YOU FEEL WARM RIGHT NOW?
- I DO.

30:46.312 --> 30:50.116
- HEAVY.
- YES.

30:50.150 --> 30:51.384
- CAN WE HAVE SOME MORE?

30:51.418 --> 30:53.420
- OKAY.

30:53.453 --> 30:55.555
THIS IS OUR PINOT.

30:55.588 --> 30:57.924
- A LITTLE BIT MORE,
I THINK, JUST A--

30:57.957 --> 31:02.095
- THIS IS FROM FRENCH
AND AMERICAN OAK BARRELS.

31:02.128 --> 31:03.563
- I'M A LITTLE WHOO-HOO.

31:03.596 --> 31:06.966
[laughter]

31:07.067 --> 31:08.168
I AM NOT A BIG DRINKER.

31:08.201 --> 31:10.503
I REALLY HAVE ZERO TOLERANCE
FOR ALCOHOL,

31:10.537 --> 31:13.473
AND I RARELY, RARELY DRINK.

31:13.506 --> 31:17.077
WHOO.

31:17.077 --> 31:19.346
- MY GOD, THIS IS--
THIS IS MY FAVORITE.

31:19.379 --> 31:21.881
- IT'S A PORT,
A BLUEBERRY PORT.

31:21.915 --> 31:25.452
[slow-motion laugh]

31:25.485 --> 31:28.922
[distorted speech]

31:28.955 --> 31:33.827
[laughter]

31:35.161 --> 31:39.899
- DON'T--DON'T LAUGH AT ME.

31:39.933 --> 31:42.268
- MY FAVORITE PERSON THIS YEAR
WAS, HANDS DOWN, TODD

31:42.302 --> 31:46.272
FROM MY LISTING
AT CENTRAL PARK WEST.

31:47.574 --> 31:49.676
AND WHEN I WAS SHOWING HIM
HOW TO BECOME A MAN,

31:49.709 --> 31:52.345
AND YOU ALL SAW THAT,
THERE WAS ONE SCENE

31:52.379 --> 31:53.680
THAT DID NOT MAKE AIR.

31:53.713 --> 31:55.682
WHEN YOU START REAL ESTATE,
YOU HAVE NO BUSINESS.

31:55.715 --> 31:57.450
YOU HAVE NO CLIENTS,
'CAUSE NOBODY'S GONNA MAKE

31:57.484 --> 31:58.885
THOSE RELATIONSHIPS FOR YOU.

31:58.918 --> 32:00.353
YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE
TO TALK TO ANYBODY.

32:00.387 --> 32:02.922
IF I'M GOING TO MENTOR TODD,
I NEED TO GET HIM

32:02.956 --> 32:05.258
VERY COMFORTABLE WITH REJECTION,
ESPECIALLY WITH THE PEOPLE

32:05.291 --> 32:06.459
THAT DON'T LIKE TO BE BOTHERED,

32:06.493 --> 32:08.561
AND THERE IS NO BETTER PLACE
TO FIND PEOPLE

32:08.595 --> 32:10.830
THAT DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU
THAN CENTRAL PARK.

32:10.864 --> 32:13.667
YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY ENJOY
BEING REJECTED, ALL RIGHT?

32:13.700 --> 32:16.536
GOOD MORNING,
SIR, HOW ARE YOU?

32:16.569 --> 32:19.172
MY NAME IS LUIS.
HOW ARE YOU?

32:19.205 --> 32:22.409
BEAUTIFUL DAY, NO?
[laughs]

32:22.442 --> 32:23.977
- I THINK
SHE'S GOT EARPHONES ON.

32:24.077 --> 32:25.912
- NO, SHE'S IGNORING US.
DON'T WORRY.

32:25.945 --> 32:27.614
NICE SHIRT.

32:27.647 --> 32:30.350
HOW ARE YOU, SIR?

32:30.383 --> 32:31.818
OKAY, NO SPEAK ENGLISH.

32:31.851 --> 32:33.486
HE DEFINITELY SPEAKS ENGLISH,
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER--

32:33.520 --> 32:36.156
I LITERALLY FACE REJECTION
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

32:36.189 --> 32:37.223
GIVE ME A HUG.

32:37.257 --> 32:39.492
- NO, NO, NO.
- NO? OKAY, NO HUG.

32:39.526 --> 32:40.760
YOU'RE GOING TO GET REJECTED
ALL THE TIME.

32:40.794 --> 32:42.328
YOU CREATE BUSINESS
BY BEING REJECTED.

32:42.362 --> 32:44.564
YOU ARE AMAZING.
I LOVE YOU TOO.

32:44.597 --> 32:45.865
IF YOU DON'T PUT YOURSELF OUT
THERE, YOU'RE NOT GONNA--

32:45.899 --> 32:47.000
NOBODY KNOWS
THAT YOU'RE THERE.

32:47.100 --> 32:49.102
JUST PICK ONE RANDOM STRANGER,
ALL RIGHT?

32:49.102 --> 32:50.236
YOU'LL GET USED TO IT.

32:50.270 --> 32:52.339
- WOULD YOU LIKE
TO BUY AN APARTMENT?

32:52.372 --> 32:54.107
COME ON, I'LL SELL YOU
AN APARTMENT.

32:54.107 --> 32:56.276
A LEASE?
SOMETHING, COME ON.

32:56.309 --> 32:57.610
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

32:57.644 --> 32:58.678
- LET HIM GO.
LET HIM GO.

32:58.712 --> 33:00.046
NO, RELAX, TODD, YOU KNOW,

33:00.080 --> 33:01.648
YOU CAN'T SCARE PEOPLE,
ALL RIGHT?

33:01.681 --> 33:04.117
ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS
ABOUT REAL ESTATE

33:04.150 --> 33:06.486
IS COMFORTABILITY,
YOU KNOW?

33:06.519 --> 33:08.154
LIKE THIS GUY
RIGHT HERE WITH THE HOOD,

33:08.188 --> 33:09.723
YOU SCARED HIM OFF.

33:09.756 --> 33:10.890
THIS GUY RIGHT HERE.

33:10.924 --> 33:12.092
- HELLO, HELLO,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

33:12.125 --> 33:13.526
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO BUY AN APARTMENT?

33:13.560 --> 33:14.728
- LISTEN.

33:14.761 --> 33:16.296
- I'M NOT REALLY LOOKING.
- COME ON, MAN.

33:16.329 --> 33:19.099
- [laughs]

33:19.132 --> 33:20.200
YOU WANT TO BUY AN APARTMENT?

33:20.233 --> 33:22.802
- I COULD GET YOU
A GOOD LEASE.

33:22.836 --> 33:23.837
- THAT'S NOT HOW YOU DO IT.

33:23.870 --> 33:25.171
TODD, YOU CAN'T BE
THAT AGGRESSIVE.

33:25.205 --> 33:26.439
- I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW.

33:26.473 --> 33:29.843
- YOU GOT TO BE A LITTLE BIT
MORE WELCOMING AT FIRST.

33:29.876 --> 33:31.277
THERE'S A PRETTY GIRL COMING.

33:31.311 --> 33:32.912
YOU KNOW WHAT?
FORGET ABOUT REAL ESTATE NOW.

33:32.946 --> 33:35.615
JUST TALK TO A BEAUTIFUL GIRL.

33:35.648 --> 33:39.652
- HI, I'M TODD.
WHERE ARE YOU LADIES FROM?

33:39.686 --> 33:41.855
ARE YOU GONNA
MOVE TO MANHATTAN?

33:41.888 --> 33:43.156
- WE'D LOVE TO.
[laughs]

33:43.189 --> 33:45.325
- OH, THEY'RE VERY CONVINCED,
ALL RIGHT.

33:45.358 --> 33:50.663
- IF YOU GUYS MOVED HERE, WOULD
YOU CALL ME FOR AN APARTMENT?

33:50.697 --> 33:52.332
- DEFINITELY.
- ALL RIGHT.

33:52.365 --> 33:55.168
[laughs]
THERE YOU GO!

33:55.201 --> 33:57.470
OH, MY GOD!
- I GET TWO, I GET TWO.

33:57.504 --> 34:00.540
- NOW, A GROUP HUG, EVERYBODY.
- YES.

34:00.573 --> 34:01.708
- YOU SEE, MAN?

34:01.741 --> 34:03.343
THAT IS WHAT REAL ESTATE'S
ALL ABOUT.

34:03.376 --> 34:06.246
- THAT WAS VERY COOL.
- [laughs]

34:06.279 --> 34:08.048
I LOVE THAT GUY,
I REALLY DO,

34:08.048 --> 34:09.416
AND AFTER WE DID THE DEAL,

34:09.449 --> 34:11.685
I TOOK HIM AND HIS FAMILY OUT
TO CELEBRATE.

34:11.718 --> 34:12.686
WE'RE CELEBRATING.

34:12.719 --> 34:14.187
- I'LL HAVE SOME DON JULIO.

34:14.220 --> 34:16.156
- DON--REALLY?

34:16.189 --> 34:18.892
- <i>SALUD.</i>
<i>- SALUD.</i>

34:18.925 --> 34:23.496
AND I LEARNED SOME VERY, VERY
INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT HIM.

34:23.530 --> 34:26.066
- HI, HOW ARE YOU?
- OH, MY GOD, JESUS.

34:26.066 --> 34:28.268
- LUIS, HOW ARE YOU?
- HOW YOU DOING?

34:28.301 --> 34:29.669
HOW YOU DOING, LUIS?
- AMAZING, SEÑOR.

34:29.703 --> 34:30.704
HOW ARE YOU?
SO YOU GUYS ARE READY?

34:30.737 --> 34:32.172
I GOT US
A PRIVATE ROOM UPSTAIRS.

34:32.205 --> 34:33.206
- YEAH, LET'S GO EAT DINNER.

34:33.239 --> 34:36.810
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS.

34:36.843 --> 34:38.712
LISTEN, BEFORE WE CONTINUE,
LET ME TELL YOU,

34:38.745 --> 34:39.846
IT HAS BEEN A PLEASURE
GETTING TO KNOW YOU GUYS.

34:39.879 --> 34:41.281
- YES, THANK YOU.

34:41.314 --> 34:43.416
- IT HAS BEEN A PLEASURE, TODD,
TO HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH YOU.

34:43.450 --> 34:45.652
- OKAY.
- I'M GLAD THAT WE'RE ALL HERE.

34:45.685 --> 34:46.653
YOU GUYS GO OUT EVERY NIGHT,
RIGHT?

34:46.686 --> 34:47.887
both: EVERY NIGHT.

34:47.921 --> 34:48.888
- EVERY SINGLE NIGHT,
SO YOU DON'T COOK?

34:48.922 --> 34:50.256
- NO.
WELL...

34:50.290 --> 34:52.092
- WHEN THEY LEFT THE HOUSE,
SHE GAVE UP COOKING.

34:52.092 --> 34:53.093
- YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY SON,
RIGHT?

34:53.093 --> 34:54.127
YOU HAVE A BROTHER
AND A SISTER?

34:54.160 --> 34:55.395
- NO, BROTHER.

34:55.428 --> 34:58.231
- AFTER MY MOTHER HAD ME,
SHE WAS FULFILLED, SO...

34:58.264 --> 34:59.933
- TELL ME ABOUT YOUR SON.
I'VE NEVER MET YOUR BROTHER.

35:00.033 --> 35:02.569
- HE LIVES DOWNTOWN.
- HE LIVES DOWNTOWN.

35:02.602 --> 35:05.605
- HE HAS ONE HOBBY.
HE FOLDS PAPER.

35:05.638 --> 35:06.673
- HE FOLDS PAPER?

35:06.706 --> 35:07.707
- YEAH, ORIGAMI.

35:07.741 --> 35:09.142
- COME ON.
- HE DOES.

35:09.175 --> 35:12.545
HE'S ONE OF THE GREATEST
ORIGAMI EXPERTS IN THE WORLD.

35:12.579 --> 35:13.947
- HOW DO YOU GET INTO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT?

35:14.047 --> 35:17.050
- HE WATCHED ME FOLD LAUNDRY.
[laughter]

35:17.083 --> 35:18.318
HE'S WRITTEN MANY BOOKS.

35:18.351 --> 35:22.856
HE EVEN WROTE A BOOK
ON EROTIC ORIGAMI.

35:22.889 --> 35:25.725
HE HAS A MAN AND A WOMAN...
- SO HOLD ON. I DON'T--

35:25.759 --> 35:29.829
- DOING WHATEVER THEY'RE DOING
OUT OF PAPER.

35:29.863 --> 35:32.399
- THEY'RE NOT ONLY DOING THINGS,
THEY'RE DOING MANY THINGS.

35:32.432 --> 35:33.400
THEY'RE DOING
ALL SORTS OF THINGS.

35:33.433 --> 35:35.935
- MANY THINGS.
- LIKE ORGIES?

35:35.969 --> 35:39.739
- YEAH, IT SHOWS YOU
HOW TO FOLD IT FOLD BY FOLD.

35:39.773 --> 35:41.441
- IS THERE--
IS THERE A MARKET FOR IT?

35:41.474 --> 35:45.178
- NO, NOT REALLY.
[laughter]

35:45.211 --> 35:48.314
- I HAVE TO SAY THAT AFTER
HEARING ABOUT EROTIC ORIGAMI,

35:48.348 --> 35:50.684
I KIND OF GOT CURIOUS,
SO I ORDERED A BOOK,

35:50.717 --> 35:53.520
AND I TRIED IT MYSELF.

35:53.553 --> 35:56.423
HERE'S A PIECE I'VE MADE.

35:56.456 --> 35:59.426
IT'S CALLED

35:59.459 --> 36:03.029
<i>ANALLY RECEPTIVE.</i>

36:06.066 --> 36:07.767
[chuckles]
IT'S TRUE.

36:07.801 --> 36:09.636
THIS IS REAL.
GOOGLE THE NAME.

36:09.669 --> 36:12.472
YOU'LL FIND IT,
AND MAKE IT YOURSELF.

36:12.505 --> 36:14.641
AND YOU'LL BE PRETTY EXCITED.

36:14.674 --> 36:18.244
[laughs]

36:18.278 --> 36:21.915
- WE AS REAL ESTATE AGENTS
NEED GREAT ASSISTANTS,

36:21.948 --> 36:24.250
AND OUR ASSISTANTS
BECOME LIKE FAMILY,

36:24.284 --> 36:28.822
AND LIKE FAMILY, SOMETIMES
THEY CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT.

36:28.855 --> 36:30.490
OLIVIA.
- YES, RYAN?

36:30.523 --> 36:31.891
- DO YOU KNOW
IF MY LUNCH IS HERE YET?

36:31.925 --> 36:33.593
- I DIDN'T ORDER YOUR LUNCH.

36:33.626 --> 36:35.228
NOW MAYBE THIS IS A GOOD TIME
TO TALK

36:35.261 --> 36:36.529
WHILE YOU'RE
ON AN EMPTY STOMACH.

36:36.563 --> 36:38.431
- WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT?

36:38.465 --> 36:40.800
- I'VE BEEN HERE AWHILE.
- UH...

36:40.834 --> 36:41.835
- I WANT TO EXPAND MY ROLE.

36:41.868 --> 36:43.403
I WANT TO HAVE
MORE RESPONSIBILITY,

36:43.436 --> 36:45.538
YOU KNOW, BE MORE HANDS-ON
WITH BUYERS.

36:45.572 --> 36:47.907
- WHY DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE, LIKE,
LIKE, DETERMINATION

36:47.941 --> 36:50.076
AND, LIKE, DESIRES, TO, LIKE,
DO STUFF WITH YOUR LIFE?

36:50.076 --> 36:51.578
CAN'T YOU JUST BE, LIKE, AWESOME
AND JUST--

36:51.611 --> 36:53.413
- YOU'RE MY--
I'M FOLLOWING IN YOUR FOOTSTEPS.

36:53.446 --> 36:55.782
- DON'T FOLLOW IN MY FOOTSTEPS.
I HAVE BIGGER FEET THAN YOU.

36:55.815 --> 36:57.083
- RYAN, COME ON.

36:57.117 --> 36:58.318
THIS'LL BE GOOD FOR YOU.
THIS'LL BE GOOD.

36:58.351 --> 36:59.652
- NO, IT'S NOT,
BECAUSE YOU WORK HERE,

36:59.686 --> 37:01.254
AND YOU WORK AS MY ASSISTANT,
AND YOU TAKE CARE OF ME.

37:01.287 --> 37:02.822
- DO YOU WANT ME TO SIT
IN THAT CHAIR FOREVER?

37:02.856 --> 37:05.291
- YES, OF COURSE I DO.
- NO, NO.

37:05.325 --> 37:06.292
- YES.

37:06.326 --> 37:08.128
OLIVIA IS GREAT.

37:08.161 --> 37:10.930
SHE'S VERY FOCUSED,
VERY FOCUSED ON WORK.

37:11.031 --> 37:12.866
I THINK
SHE'S A LITTLE CONFUSED,

37:12.899 --> 37:16.369
BECAUSE HER JOB IS ME,

37:16.403 --> 37:18.038
AND I NEED HER TO FOCUS ON ME.

37:18.038 --> 37:19.072
IMAGINE, LIKE,
A LITTLE BABY, LIKE,

37:19.105 --> 37:20.607
IN ITS CRIB,
AND THERE'S NO MOM,

37:20.640 --> 37:21.841
AND THE BABY'S JUST LIKE,
"HOW DO I LIVE?

37:21.875 --> 37:24.044
HOW DO I LEARN ENGLISH
AND WORDS?"

37:24.044 --> 37:25.812
AND CAN'T,
'CAUSE THERE'S NO MOM THERE.

37:25.845 --> 37:29.049
THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.
- IT'LL BE FINE.

37:29.049 --> 37:31.117
I'M A CATERPILLAR.
I NEED TO GET IN MY...

37:31.151 --> 37:34.187
- OH, DON'T METAPHOR ME.
HOW ABOUT WE DO THIS?

37:34.220 --> 37:35.955
WHY DON'T WE START
WORKING ON ONE CLIENT?

37:36.056 --> 37:37.323
IF IT GOES WELL
AND YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL

37:37.357 --> 37:40.460
AND YOU CLOSE THEM,
WE'LL OPEN IT UP FROM THERE.

37:40.493 --> 37:42.095
- ONE CLIENT A MONTH FROM YOU,

37:42.128 --> 37:44.964
AND THEN ALSO, I CAN BRING IN
WHOEVER I WANT PERSONALLY.

37:45.065 --> 37:47.600
IF I HAVE A BUYER
OR SOMEONE WHO'S RENTING,

37:47.634 --> 37:49.336
I CAN WORK WITH THEM
IF TIME PERMITS.

37:49.369 --> 37:51.438
YOUR LIFE ISN'T GOING TO FALL
TO PIECES, RYAN.

37:51.471 --> 37:53.640
- IT'S GONNA FALL TO PIECES.
- IT'LL BE FINE.

37:53.673 --> 37:55.809
- ONE BUYER,
BUT TOMORROW, THOUGH.

37:55.842 --> 37:57.944
I HAVE TOO MUCH STUFF
TO DO RIGHT NOW,

37:57.977 --> 38:00.680
AND I'M STILL HUNGRY.

38:00.714 --> 38:02.682
- [coughing]

38:02.716 --> 38:04.818
[knocking on door]

38:04.851 --> 38:07.020
- COME IN.
- LUIS?

38:07.020 --> 38:08.021
- YES.

38:08.021 --> 38:09.055
- I THOUGHT
YOU WERE FEELING BETTER.

38:09.089 --> 38:10.190
- I'M NOT FEELING BETTER.

38:10.223 --> 38:11.658
I HATE MYSELF WHEN I'M SICK.

38:11.691 --> 38:13.893
- WELL, I BROUGHT YOU
FOOD AND A DRINK.

38:13.927 --> 38:15.462
WELL, IT'S WATER,
'CAUSE YOU DON'T DRINK WATER,

38:15.495 --> 38:17.230
AND YOU DON'T EAT FOOD,
WHICH IS WHY YOU'RE SICK.

38:17.263 --> 38:20.100
IT'S GONNA MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.
YOU NEED ENERGY.

38:20.133 --> 38:21.935
- RONITA IS A VERY NEW AGENT
IN THE CITY

38:22.035 --> 38:24.704
WHO JUST STARTED REAL ESTATE
AND JOINED DOUGLAS ELLIMAN

38:24.738 --> 38:26.106
AND WHO HAS
APPROACHED ME

38:26.139 --> 38:28.908
MANY, MANY TIMES BECAUSE
SHE WANTED TO WORK WITH ME.

38:28.942 --> 38:31.177
IT'S TIME FOR AN ASSISTANT.

38:31.211 --> 38:33.513
- WELL, I'M NOT GONNA LEAVE
UNTIL I SEE YOU EAT SOMETHING.

38:33.546 --> 38:34.748
- WHAT ARE YOU,
MY MOTHER, MY DOCTOR?

38:34.781 --> 38:36.182
- WELL, THIS IS
WHY YOU'RE SICK.

38:36.216 --> 38:37.817
HOW ARE WE GONNA DO BUSINESS
IF YOU'RE SICK?

38:37.851 --> 38:41.054
TWO BITES, AND I'LL LEAVE.

38:41.054 --> 38:42.188
THIS IS PROBABLY
THE ONLY THING YOU'VE EVER EATEN

38:42.222 --> 38:43.757
ALL DAY, CORRECT?

38:43.790 --> 38:44.791
DID YOU HAVE ANY WATER TODAY?

38:44.824 --> 38:46.126
NO, OKAY.

38:46.159 --> 38:48.194
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU SURVIVED 27 YEARS

38:48.228 --> 38:49.396
WITHOUT EATING FOOD.

38:49.429 --> 38:51.364
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

38:51.398 --> 38:53.466
- [coughing]

38:53.500 --> 38:59.305
- HELLO.
WELCOME, COME IN.

38:59.339 --> 39:02.609
TODAY IS THE OPEN HOUSE
OF THE APTHORP.

39:07.681 --> 39:09.416
MY JOB IS
TO SELL THE APARTMENT.

39:09.449 --> 39:11.918
JORDAN'S JOB IS TO MAKE SURE

39:12.018 --> 39:14.721
THAT THE OPEN HOUSE
RUNS SMOOTHLY.

39:18.258 --> 39:21.327
- MEOW, MEOW, MEOW, MEOW.

39:31.671 --> 39:34.474
- I NEED ANOTHER ONE.

39:34.507 --> 39:35.775
ME?

39:35.809 --> 39:38.712
THIS IS MY--THIS ISN'T
MY FIRST RODEO, HONEY.

39:38.745 --> 39:41.548
I HOLD UP.

39:41.581 --> 39:44.184
[laughs]

39:52.726 --> 39:54.928
- MAY I TALK TO YOU A SECOND?

40:04.137 --> 40:06.072
- AFTER THAT DAY,
JORDAN IS ONLY ALLOWED

40:06.106 --> 40:09.409
ONE DRINK PER OPEN HOUSE,
AND MICHELLE, ZERO.

40:14.147 --> 40:17.784
- WHEN YOU WORK IN REAL ESTATE,
YOU'RE ON THE CLOCK 24-7.

40:17.817 --> 40:19.386
[phone ringing]

40:19.419 --> 40:21.087
RYAN SERHANT, NEST SEEKERS.
[phone rings]

40:21.121 --> 40:22.188
- FREDRIK SPEAKING.
[phone rings]

40:22.222 --> 40:23.223
- HELLO, THIS IS LUIS.

40:23.256 --> 40:25.191
- AND WORK WILL
FIND YOU WHEREVER,

40:25.225 --> 40:27.527
WHENEVER IT MIGHT BE.

40:32.499 --> 40:33.867
HELLO.
- HI.

40:33.900 --> 40:35.135
- HI.
- HI, WELCOME.

40:35.168 --> 40:36.169
ARE YOU CHECKING IN?

40:36.202 --> 40:37.637
- YES.

40:40.173 --> 40:42.142
- IT'S YOUR FIRST TIME?
- YES.

40:42.175 --> 40:44.044
WHAT MOST PEOPLE
DON'T KNOW ABOUT ME

40:44.077 --> 40:47.313
IS THAT I HAVE THE HAIRIEST ARMS
YOU HAVE EVER SEEN.

40:47.347 --> 40:49.382
I HAVE WEREWOLF ARMS.

40:49.416 --> 40:50.450
HI, I'M RYAN.

40:50.483 --> 40:52.185
- STEPHANIE.

40:52.218 --> 40:53.920
- SO IF LASER HAIR REMOVAL
WILL SAVE ME TIME

40:53.953 --> 40:56.322
EVERY MORNING, LET'S DO IT.

40:56.356 --> 40:57.524
SHIRT OFF?

40:57.557 --> 40:59.259
- YEAH.

41:06.366 --> 41:07.467
- COMFORTABLE?

41:07.500 --> 41:08.501
- YEAH, AS LONG
AS I GOT MY PHONE,

41:08.535 --> 41:12.305
SO WE'RE OKAY.
- OKAY.

41:12.339 --> 41:16.242
[machine beeping]

41:18.078 --> 41:19.879
ONE, TWO, THREE.

41:19.913 --> 41:21.081
DID THAT HURT?

41:21.114 --> 41:23.616
- NO, I'M A MAN.

41:26.486 --> 41:28.655
OOH, I COULD FEEL THAT ONE.

41:28.688 --> 41:30.290
THAT FEELS A LITTLE WEIRD.

41:30.323 --> 41:31.324
AH!

41:31.358 --> 41:34.494
THIS DOES NOT FEEL GOOD AT ALL.

41:34.527 --> 41:36.363
I FEEL THAT, LIKE,
ON THE VEIN.

41:36.396 --> 41:38.231
- YOU'RE DOING REALLY GOOD.
- ON THE OUTSIDE.

41:38.264 --> 41:40.000
ON THE INSIDE,
I'M A SCREAMING GIRL.

41:40.100 --> 41:44.304
[phone ringing]

41:45.705 --> 41:48.108
THIS IS RYAN.

41:48.108 --> 41:51.344
I'M SHOPPING A FEW BLOCKS

41:51.378 --> 41:52.379
I'LL BE THERE SHORTLY.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

41:52.412 --> 41:54.948
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

41:54.981 --> 41:56.116
YEAH, I HAD TO GET SOMETHING--

YES, I AM.

41:58.651 --> 42:00.787
I CAN'T HEAR YOU.
I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

42:00.820 --> 42:04.157
I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU LATER.
OKAY, BYE.

42:04.190 --> 42:06.526

42:17.370 --> 42:19.105
- GIVE ME FIVE.
THAT'S AMAZING.

42:19.139 --> 42:20.340
- [laughs]

42:20.373 --> 42:22.275
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
LISTEN, IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE.

42:22.308 --> 42:25.345

BUT I NEED A BREAK.

42:25.378 --> 42:26.813

LET ME TELL YOU,

42:26.846 --> 42:28.114
NINE MONTHS OF FILMING.

42:28.148 --> 42:29.949

I'M GOING TO BERLIN.
I'M GOING TO CAPRI.

42:31.985 --> 42:34.154
I'M GOING TO ST. TROPEZ.

42:34.187 --> 42:38.591
- YOU SAID WE WERE DONE
WITH SEASON THREE.

42:38.625 --> 42:42.495
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

42:42.529 --> 42:45.365
- SO DON'T TELL ME IT'S A WRAP.
[laughter]

42:45.398 --> 42:46.766
IS THIS A WRAP OR NOT?

42:46.800 --> 42:48.468
- IT'S A WRAP.

42:48.501 --> 42:52.105
