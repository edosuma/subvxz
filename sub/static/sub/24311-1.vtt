from our cartoon president.

00:18.965 --> 00:21.547
we are one year
into my presidency,

00:21.548 --> 00:25.297
and it's time to finally admit
I am absolutely crushing it.

00:25.298 --> 00:28.588
These past few weeks alone, I've
achieved headlines with words

00:28.589 --> 00:33.297
like "porn star," "shithole,"
and "cognitive function."

00:33.298 --> 00:35.131
It's Showtime. I mean,
I can say "shithole," right?

00:35.132 --> 00:38.880
Can I say [bleep] [bleep]

00:38.881 --> 00:42.588
No? We found the line
for season one!

00:42.589 --> 00:43.964
So, how did I do it?

00:43.965 --> 00:48.131
Well, for one, everyone knows my
brain has great bone structure.

00:48.132 --> 00:51.588
My doctor said
that my I.Q. was 180/90.

00:51.589 --> 00:52.922
He said I'm so smart

00:52.923 --> 00:54.172
that he doesn't know
how my organs function.

00:54.173 --> 00:56.588
I mean, I was a great athlete.

00:56.589 --> 00:58.172
The Yankees wanted me to sign,

00:58.173 --> 00:59.672
but I was in talks
with the Knicks,

00:59.673 --> 01:02.672
which broke down because, how do
you say no to the Yankees?

01:02.673 --> 01:04.629
One time,
Steinbrenner's having a party,

01:04.631 --> 01:06.672
and Don King walks in
with Roger Ailes

01:06.673 --> 01:09.797
and two of the hottest,
youngest pieces of --

01:09.798 --> 01:13.505
So, why is this show
called Our Cartoon President?

01:13.506 --> 01:14.839
No one knows.

01:14.840 --> 01:17.214
But I'd like to think
that it's because we're all

01:17.215 --> 01:18.547
in this together, folks.

01:18.548 --> 01:21.588
Each and every one of you voted
for me, and the ones who didn't,

01:21.589 --> 01:24.797
you kind of wanted to see
what would happen,

01:24.798 --> 01:28.006
and it's happening more
than you could have imagined.

01:28.007 --> 01:31.880
Now, some are worried that
this show might humanize me.

01:31.881 --> 01:33.463
Well, too late, folks.

01:33.464 --> 01:35.672
After my recent physical,
Dr. Ronny assured me

01:35.673 --> 01:41.047
that I am a human being
and there's no cure for that.

01:41.048 --> 01:43.297
I'm also our cartoon president,

09:12.168 --> 09:13.916
Look, Mike,
I hate to do this,

09:13.917 --> 09:16.167
but I need to listen
to you.

09:16.168 --> 09:17.499
I need to get Melania
an anniversary gift.

09:17.500 --> 09:21.292
What do you get the woman who
has the man who has everything?

09:21.293 --> 09:23.666
The Bible says in times of --
Skip it.

09:23.667 --> 09:27.375
I got Karen and her closest
gal pals third-row tickets

09:27.376 --> 09:29.292
to Joel Osteen's
prayer fest.

09:29.293 --> 09:32.666
I would have joined them,
but my impure thoughts

09:32.667 --> 09:34.083
for an audiobook narrator

09:34.084 --> 09:36.708
forced me to take shelter in
the arms of God for the evening.

09:36.709 --> 09:38.624
So, wait, wait.

09:38.625 --> 09:40.666
You pawned Karen off
on someone else?

09:40.667 --> 09:44.417
Why, she loves spending time
with her fellow Christ-ettes.

09:44.418 --> 09:47.541
Say, why don't we set up
the gals on a night out?

09:47.542 --> 09:48.541
Michael,
have you met Karen?

09:48.542 --> 09:51.208
It's like talking
to a human shower curtain.

09:51.209 --> 09:53.041
Why, thank you, sir.

09:53.042 --> 09:55.208
That's not a compliment,
Michael.

09:55.209 --> 09:58.167
And then Ohio came in,
and I was like, "Wow.

09:58.168 --> 10:00.208
I mean, I think
this might happen."

10:00.209 --> 10:01.417
Yeah, whatever, Dad.

10:01.418 --> 10:03.833
So, I know you said
we're out of our depth,

10:03.834 --> 10:05.624
but we can boost
your image.

10:05.625 --> 10:07.375
Remember
when everyone said you were

10:07.376 --> 10:09.000
the dumbest person
in the world,

10:09.001 --> 10:11.041
then we showed up on TV,

10:11.042 --> 10:12.083
and they were like,
"We spoke too soon"?

10:12.084 --> 10:14.375
We could be
your new spokesmen.

10:14.376 --> 10:16.875
We should definitely get
Susan on the paperwork.

10:16.876 --> 10:18.375
Full disclosure, boys --
I sort of made up Susan

10:18.376 --> 10:21.749
so critics would think I had
someone doing paperwork.

10:21.750 --> 10:23.208
Wa-- Susan's not real?

10:23.209 --> 10:26.250
But she sounded so nice
on the phone.

10:26.251 --> 10:27.292
That was Jared.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.666
All right.
Forget Susan.

10:28.667 --> 10:29.958
Imagine it, Dad.

10:29.959 --> 10:31.916
Your two sons on television,

10:31.917 --> 10:34.417
wearing makeup,
kicking ass.

10:34.418 --> 10:35.417
Interesting.

10:35.418 --> 10:36.583
Well, any man willing

10:36.584 --> 10:38.083
to put on makeup for me
has my trust.

10:38.084 --> 10:42.041
Go on TV,
but no Sunday shows.

10:42.042 --> 10:43.000
Fuck yeah!

10:43.001 --> 10:45.083
Stick to friendly confines --
Hannity.

10:45.084 --> 10:47.125
But don't talk
about Russia.

10:47.126 --> 10:48.458
I'm good. It's Eric
you got to worry about it.

10:48.459 --> 10:52.041
Yeah, actually, Dad, uh,
it's me you got to worry about.

10:52.042 --> 10:54.083
Eric,
if you're ever in doubt,

10:54.084 --> 10:56.916
you just find a policeman
and tell him you're lost.

10:56.917 --> 10:58.417
All right, Chuck and Nancy,

10:58.418 --> 10:59.958
before you try
to slip your agenda

10:59.959 --> 11:01.167
into the State of the Union,

11:01.168 --> 11:03.041
just know
you can't soften me up

11:03.042 --> 11:04.624
with a bunch
of New York talk.

11:04.625 --> 11:06.250
Of course not,
Mr. President.

11:06.251 --> 11:07.791
We're not going to talk
about New York.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.958
What about it?

11:09.959 --> 11:11.292
I was taking the Staten Island
ferry the other day.

11:11.293 --> 11:13.958
Empire State Building.
Hudson River.

11:13.959 --> 11:16.666
Katz's Deli.
Pizza!

11:16.667 --> 11:18.292
Uh, train track!

11:18.293 --> 11:19.624
[together] Central Park!

11:19.625 --> 11:21.458
Five.
Okay, you won me over.

11:21.459 --> 11:22.791
What do you want me to do?

11:22.792 --> 11:25.375
Just add the word "progress"
to your speech

11:25.376 --> 11:26.875
so we can tell our donors

11:26.876 --> 11:29.749
that you capitulated
to all our demands.

11:29.750 --> 11:31.125
You don't even have
to mean it.

11:31.126 --> 11:33.041
Now you're playing
to my strengths.

11:33.042 --> 11:35.167
And, by the way,
who's in charge of your party?

11:35.168 --> 11:36.958
Right now it seems
like a bunch of seagulls

11:36.959 --> 11:38.499
fighting over
a potato chip.

11:45.625 --> 11:47.791
What the hell
are you doing here?

11:47.792 --> 11:48.916
What am I doing here?

11:48.917 --> 11:49.916
What are you doing
to your teeth?

11:49.917 --> 11:51.000
I'm brushing them.

11:51.001 --> 11:53.375
You got hair on your teeth?

11:53.376 --> 11:54.000
What am I missing here, Don?

11:54.001 --> 11:55.958
What do you want, Ted?

11:55.959 --> 11:58.333
I decided to pick the lock
on your bedroom,

11:58.334 --> 12:01.000
sneak into your shower,
and wait for you to come in

12:01.001 --> 12:03.499
so I could bounce a State
of the Union idea off you.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.875
Oh, here we go.
Here's what I'm thinking.

12:05.876 --> 12:09.250
Around minute three, you pretend
like you've lost your place,

12:09.251 --> 12:12.167
say, "Oh, the hell with it,"
and let your good pal Ted Cruz

12:12.168 --> 12:13.167
take the reins.
No can do, Ted.

12:13.168 --> 12:15.583
But if it gets you
out of my bathroom,

12:15.584 --> 12:17.333
I'll tell people
you're not that bad of a guy

12:17.334 --> 12:18.583
so they stop judging a book
by its odor.

12:18.584 --> 12:22.375
That's got to be the nicest
thing anyone's ever said to me.

12:22.376 --> 12:25.708
And in return, I promise
not to stab you in the back

12:25.709 --> 12:26.916
for the sake of attention.

12:26.917 --> 12:28.250
Great.
Anything else?

12:28.251 --> 12:30.333
Now, is everyone
brushing their teeth,

12:30.334 --> 12:32.250
or is this, like,
an alternative-medicine thing?

12:32.251 --> 12:35.250
As we all know,
President Trump and I

12:35.251 --> 12:37.333
haven't always seen
eye to eye,

12:37.334 --> 12:38.375
but our boy
has turned a corner

12:38.376 --> 12:42.499
and decided to do things
the Washington way,

12:42.500 --> 12:47.541
and I have agreed to value
political expediency

12:47.542 --> 12:51.125
over my conscience.

First, let me just say it's
an honor to be in the presence

13:05.625 --> 13:07.541
of what used to be
Donald Trump's sperm.

Good morning, Sean.

13:13.667 --> 13:14.791
I am Eric.

13:14.792 --> 13:16.583
Let's start
with the first question

13:16.584 --> 13:18.083
your dad
told me to ask you.

13:18.084 --> 13:20.167
Why are you good?
Uh, hate to interrupt, Sean,

13:20.168 --> 13:21.624
but I just need to say
right up front

13:21.625 --> 13:23.875
that we are not here
to talk about Russia.

13:23.876 --> 13:25.583
Of course. That's nonsense.
Russia doesn't exist.

13:25.584 --> 13:29.041
Dad told us we're not allowed
to talk about it.

13:29.042 --> 13:30.499
Uh, that Russia stuff
is secret.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.167
I doubt
we've even been to Russia.

13:32.168 --> 13:33.624
I do not recall.
Yes,

13:33.625 --> 13:35.167
and anyone
who says otherwise

13:35.168 --> 13:37.624
can join Democratic
drowning victims in hell.

13:37.625 --> 13:38.708
It's funny, Sean.

13:38.709 --> 13:41.083
The Russia stuff
is so good at being fake

13:41.084 --> 13:43.708
that it almost feels
entirely real.

13:43.709 --> 13:45.333
Totally.
But, like, if it was fake,

13:45.334 --> 13:48.250
why would Dad be so mad
about it?

13:48.251 --> 13:49.458
You'd think he'd be like,

13:49.459 --> 13:51.875
"Oh, that's not a thing,
and we're moving on."

13:51.876 --> 13:53.499
Eric,
you're talking about it.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.250
Shut up,
or Dad's gonna be so mad.

13:56.251 --> 13:58.958
Dad, we messed it up!

13:58.959 --> 14:01.417
You make it so hard.

14:02.750 --> 14:05.417

I'm sorry.

14:05.418 --> 14:07.791
When we come back,

14:07.792 --> 14:11.083
Rudy Giuliani and I
will talk over a black doctor,

14:11.084 --> 14:13.125
and later, we'll watch an
American flag throw a football.

14:13.126 --> 14:15.833
Roll the reverse-mortgage ad.

14:15.834 --> 14:18.499
And then they called Wisconsin,
and I was president.

14:18.500 --> 14:19.916
Do you want
to hear it again?

14:19.917 --> 14:21.458
Always.

14:21.459 --> 14:24.749
But, first, how's your State
of the Union address coming?

14:24.750 --> 14:26.624
Terrific.
Stephen Miller's writing it.

14:26.625 --> 14:29.958

14:39.084 --> 14:41.292
That's great.

14:41.293 --> 14:43.666
And I've just been informed
of your anniversary.

14:43.667 --> 14:47.791
So, what do you have planned
with the little lady?

14:47.792 --> 14:49.916
Well, I'd love to say,
but I really don't like

14:49.917 --> 14:51.791
to throw my wealth
in people's faces.

She doesn't even know
the first thing about fashion.

15:19.667 --> 15:21.375
She told me
her favorite designer

15:21.376 --> 15:22.958
is Cracker Barrel

When I heard the president
and his phony-baloney cronies

15:32.584 --> 15:36.208
in Washingtoni-ony
were working on an agenda

15:36.209 --> 15:39.375
that will bankrupt
regular folks, I thought,

15:39.376 --> 15:42.041
"What is the most callous,
most self-serving thing

15:42.042 --> 15:43.208

forward on brushing my teeth.

15:53.376 --> 15:56.375
Just need to find a toothpaste
that goes down smooth.

15:56.376 --> 15:59.041
We know we screwed up by making
a passing reference to Russia,

15:59.042 --> 16:00.749
but we can fix this.

16:00.750 --> 16:03.666
We just have to get everyone
to feel really bad for us.

16:03.667 --> 16:06.167
And so Eric's gonna go,
and he's gonna disappear

16:06.168 --> 16:07.541
into
the Bermuda Triangle.

16:07.542 --> 16:10.541
Really, Eric?
You're okay with this?

16:10.542 --> 16:12.167
Yeah. I mean,
I'm sort of just hearing it

16:12.168 --> 16:14.333
for the first time now.

16:14.334 --> 16:15.833
You know what?
You've done enough.

16:15.834 --> 16:17.749
You'd better hope
my brain makes me tweet

16:17.750 --> 16:19.417
something
that distracts the media.

16:19.418 --> 16:21.833
It's really anyone's guess
until I get on that toilet.

16:21.834 --> 16:25.000
And the dog on my dress
is chasing a bone,

16:25.001 --> 16:27.125
and the bone
is on my back.

16:27.126 --> 16:28.083
Oh, my God.

Now, here's where things
get really kooky.

stays open late on Mondays?

16:48.500 --> 16:51.125
Do not talk to me
right now.

that you look like Karen Pence.

in reflecting pool.
