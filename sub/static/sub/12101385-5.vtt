What news?

12:18.834 --> 12:21.333
We went to visit Kenny
over at Delaware County Prison

12:21.417 --> 12:24.291
the other day, and he asked us
if we would consider

12:24.375 --> 12:27.959
-taking Erin's son, DJ, in.
-Take him in?

12:30.333 --> 12:32.041
Like-- like adopt him?

12:33.542 --> 12:34.709
What'd you tell him?

12:36.375 --> 12:38.458
We told him
we'd think about it.

12:38.542 --> 12:40.250
Kenny still has to talk
to the lawyer.

12:41.542 --> 12:43.125
JOHN: Right now,
DJ's still living

12:43.208 --> 12:44.542
with Dylan and his parents.

12:45.542 --> 12:48.792
Do you think
Kenny ever hit her, John?

12:48.875 --> 12:50.959
-Erin?
-MARE: Come on.

12:51.041 --> 12:54.458
-We all know what he's like.
-(SIGHS)

12:54.542 --> 12:55.834
There were times we suspected

12:55.917 --> 12:57.542
-things weren't good, but...
-BILLY: Here you go.

12:57.625 --> 12:59.667
...Erin was tough,
like her mother.

12:59.750 --> 13:01.208
I mean, you remember Rachel.

13:01.291 --> 13:02.583
She didn't tell anybody
she had leukemia

13:02.667 --> 13:04.625
until she was going
into hospice.

13:04.709 --> 13:06.542
Erin was a lot like that.
She...

13:07.375 --> 13:08.709
she didn't like
to talk about stuff.

13:08.792 --> 13:11.625
No, but we all knew
he wasn't treating her right.

13:11.709 --> 13:14.667
Of course. That's...
why we took care of her.

13:14.750 --> 13:17.583
Erin even lived with Billy
for a little while.

13:18.458 --> 13:21.083
When did she live
with you, Bill?

13:21.166 --> 13:24.250
Oh... (CLEARS THROAT) ...God.
That was like, uh...

13:25.250 --> 13:27.583
three years ago. At least.

13:28.959 --> 13:30.750
What did she move in for?

13:32.500 --> 13:34.041
Well, her mother just died

13:34.125 --> 13:38.041
and Kenny was drinking a lot,
I think, and...

13:38.125 --> 13:40.333
and we didn't want her
around that.

13:40.417 --> 13:42.583
So I asked her
to come stay with me,

13:42.667 --> 13:45.041
and I fixed her up a room
in the basement.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.250
Mm. How long she stay?

13:49.166 --> 13:50.250
Uh...

13:51.583 --> 13:53.250
three weeks, maybe?

13:53.333 --> 13:54.667
It was little longer than that,
wasn't it?

13:54.750 --> 13:56.208
I thought it was at least
a couple months

13:56.291 --> 13:58.333
-she was with you.
-(BILLY SCOFFS)

13:58.417 --> 14:00.834

It was a long time ago.

14:04.250 --> 14:06.417
-I gotta get going.
-JOHN: Where are you going?

14:06.500 --> 14:10.041
BILLY: Uh,
Matty's having that fundraiser

14:10.125 --> 14:11.834
for his daughter
at the Duffer's.

14:13.875 --> 14:15.458
You know, I told him
I'd stopped by.

14:17.041 --> 14:18.542
-Have a good night.
-See you later.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.875
-Bye, Bill. Have fun.

about that, like...

14:43.500 --> 14:45.834
having to see him every day
now that you know?

14:47.458 --> 14:50.500
I don't know.
It's fucking weird, you know?

14:53.291 --> 14:54.875

14:55.500 --> 14:57.542
Uh... (SCOFFS)

14:57.625 --> 15:00.792

15:06.375 --> 15:09.041
Either way, I'm not going
to college next year.

15:09.125 --> 15:11.750
Might just enroll in that

15:11.834 --> 15:13.041

you weren't in bed.

No, you weren't out in the den.
