WEBVTT

00:20.200 --> 00:21.333
I'll be back!

00:21.400 --> 00:22.866
I'm free!

01:10.933 --> 01:12.100
Thanks for the ride.

01:12.166 --> 01:13.833
You're doing us the favor.

01:13.900 --> 01:16.466
Filling in
for our regular sitter.

01:16.533 --> 01:17.900
Here's the house.

01:18.933 --> 01:20.900
I know this place.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.300
You grew up here.

01:25.366 --> 01:27.700
Time to meet the kids.

01:27.766 --> 01:29.433
And I hope you like precocious.

01:38.600 --> 01:40.233
Is this her?

01:40.300 --> 01:41.633
Meet, Gina.

01:41.700 --> 01:45.033
When you watch them,
watch yourself.

01:45.100 --> 01:46.500
- Come on, Dan.
- Oh, my God, Cindy.

01:46.566 --> 01:49.366
- We can't just leave her here.
- Shut up!

01:49.433 --> 01:51.533
Do you wanna leave or not?

02:49.566 --> 02:51.333
It's just a phase!

02:51.400 --> 02:54.933
Roly-poly, fat and ugly.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.700
Roly-poly, fat and ugly.

03:12.200 --> 03:13.900
Ah!

03:19.800 --> 03:22.233
Hi, you must be Gina.

03:22.300 --> 03:24.866
I'm sorry it took so long,
I didn't hear the bell.

03:24.933 --> 03:27.366
Oh, don't worry,
I, uh, I just got that.

03:27.433 --> 03:29.033
Cindy Franklin.
How are ya?

03:29.100 --> 03:30.066
Good.

03:30.133 --> 03:31.300
Come on.

03:33.200 --> 03:35.866
'Here are my angels.'

03:35.933 --> 03:37.266
Say hi to Gina, she'll be
sitting with you tonight.

03:37.333 --> 03:39.333
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:40.266 --> 03:41.633
Ken, this is Gina.

03:41.700 --> 03:43.933
She's, uh, subbing
for Rita tonight.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.200
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:45.266 --> 03:47.500
Thanks for taking over
at such short notice.

03:47.566 --> 03:49.500
Rita tells us you're a model.

03:49.566 --> 03:50.933
Well, yeah, only part time.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.666
It just, it helps pay
my way through school.

03:53.733 --> 03:57.100
You certainly
have the figure for it.

03:57.166 --> 03:59.200
Well, I work on it.

04:00.933 --> 04:02.100
'Oh.'

04:06.833 --> 04:09.433
Few souvenirs from the academy.

04:09.500 --> 04:10.966
'My misspent youth
I'm afraid.'

04:11.033 --> 04:12.466
Uh, he ranked 10th in his class

04:12.533 --> 04:15.133
but gave up
his military career for me.

04:16.600 --> 04:18.900
So now I'm a lawyer.

04:18.966 --> 04:21.333
'Same attitude.
No khakis.'

04:22.666 --> 04:25.466
Now, I don't want you to worry.

04:25.533 --> 04:27.633
It's all securely locked u
and under control.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.300
Here's Ken's bosses number
in the mountains.

04:41.366 --> 04:44.000
It's about a three-hour drive
round trip.

04:44.066 --> 04:45.500
We should be back before 1:00.

04:45.566 --> 04:48.466
Oh, don't rush,
I have plenty of studying.

04:48.533 --> 04:51.066
And the fridge, it's packed with
food, in case you want a snack.

04:51.133 --> 04:53.333
Oh, thanks, but no thanks.

04:53.400 --> 04:55.633
I brought mine. Tsk.

04:55.700 --> 04:57.433
All you kids are on diets.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.833
Yeah, well, believe it or not,
I used to be a blimp.

04:59.900 --> 05:03.033
I mean, my answer to anxiety
was to eat..

05:03.100 --> 05:04.533
...everything else
within reach.

05:04.600 --> 05:07.233
Wow, you certainly cured
that habit.

05:07.300 --> 05:08.633
'Have a great time tonight.'

05:08.700 --> 05:09.900
'Okay, great,
I'm looking forward to it.'

05:09.966 --> 05:11.266
'Okay, goodnight.'

05:11.333 --> 05:12.466
- 'Goodnight.'
- 'Goodnight.'

05:12.533 --> 05:14.733
Okay, now
we're gonna have some fun.

05:14.800 --> 05:16.800
You guys wanna play
Monopoly or Twister

05:16.866 --> 05:19.366
Battleship, um, charades?

05:19.433 --> 05:22.133
- Whoa.
- Look, lamo.

05:22.200 --> 05:25.366
This is our house
and these are our rules.

05:25.433 --> 05:27.600
We eat what we want.
Watch what we want.

05:27.666 --> 05:29.400
'And go to bed when we want.'

05:29.466 --> 05:32.166
- Damn straight.
- You get the living room.

05:32.233 --> 05:34.433
And if you behave,
the kitchen

05:34.500 --> 05:36.066
when we're not in it.

05:36.133 --> 05:37.366
You don't hassle us..

05:37.433 --> 05:39.100
'...we don't hassle you.'

05:39.166 --> 05:41.133
Damn straight.

05:41.200 --> 05:43.833
Get it? Got it!
Good.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.933
Control,
I'm in control.

05:50.500 --> 05:51.800
'How's it going so far?'

05:51.866 --> 05:54.300
It is

05:54.366 --> 05:55.566
'Well, can't you make
friends with them?'

05:55.633 --> 05:56.766
No, they don't want
to be friends.

05:56.833 --> 05:58.666
'Have you tried?'

05:58.733 --> 06:01.133
Have I tried?
Yeah, kinda.

06:01.200 --> 06:03.100
So far they've tripped me,
trapped me

06:03.166 --> 06:05.466
booby-trapped
the staircase with slinkies.

06:05.533 --> 06:06.700
It's a horror show.

06:06.766 --> 06:08.733
- 'Sounds like a good time.'
- What can I do?

06:08.800 --> 06:10.600
'Well, you have to stay
in control.'

06:10.666 --> 06:11.866
- Yeah.
- 'You know that.'

06:11.933 --> 06:13.666
Well, you know what, Rita,
actually it's probably

06:13.733 --> 06:15.433
getting pretty late,
it's time to put

06:15.500 --> 06:16.800
the little darlings to bed.

06:16.866 --> 06:19.000
- 'Right, have fun.'
- Yeah, wish me luck.

06:19.066 --> 06:20.266
'Good luck,
see you in the morning.'

06:20.333 --> 06:22.633
- Okay. Thanks, bye.
- 'Bye.'

06:27.600 --> 06:29.666
Ricky, Dolly.

06:29.733 --> 06:32.500
It's time for bed.

06:35.700 --> 06:38.533
Ricky, Dolly.

06:40.533 --> 06:42.633
Where are you guys?

06:44.666 --> 06:46.066
It's story time,
where are you?

06:46.133 --> 06:48.633
Are you up in your room?

06:48.700 --> 06:50.700
Can you hear me?

06:51.633 --> 06:53.500
Ah!

06:53.566 --> 06:56.033
Come on,
where are you guys?

08:01.033 --> 08:02.433
Alright.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.633
Front and center right now.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.133
It was him.

08:13.200 --> 08:14.833
He pulled all the food
out of the fridge.

08:14.900 --> 08:17.033
It was her idea.
She told me to.

08:17.100 --> 08:18.733
- Did not.
- Did to.

08:18.800 --> 08:20.900
'It's not the mess
that I'm concerned with.'

08:20.966 --> 08:23.066
'Look at what you're eating,
look at this food.'

08:23.133 --> 08:24.433
It's junk food, it's poison.

08:24.500 --> 08:27.166
It's-it's high fat, low fiber.

08:27.233 --> 08:29.333
Heart attack food.

08:29.400 --> 08:33.333
- Roly-poly, fat and ugly.
- Roly-poly, fat and ugly.

08:35.733 --> 08:37.700
How could you know that?

08:40.300 --> 08:41.300
Oh.

08:41.366 --> 08:44.233
Okay, um,
off to bed with you guys.

08:44.300 --> 08:48.033
Just pick out a story and
I'll read it to you soon as I..

08:48.100 --> 08:50.333
...as soon as I
clean up this mess.

09:06.566 --> 09:08.633
Old habits die hard.

09:10.033 --> 09:14.033
Bet our babysitter
can't eat just one.

09:34.666 --> 09:36.566
Just come home.
Please come home.

09:36.633 --> 09:37.700
I gotta get out of here.

09:43.033 --> 09:44.166
- Hello.
- 'Hi, Gina.'

09:44.233 --> 09:46.500
'It's Cindy Franklin.
How are you doing?'

09:46.566 --> 09:47.866
'Enjoying yourself?'

09:47.933 --> 09:50.133
Oh, too much.

09:50.200 --> 09:53.200
'I'm glad to hear that
because we have a favor to ask.'

09:53.266 --> 09:55.233
'Would you mind
staying all night?'

09:57.166 --> 09:58.500
All night?

09:58.566 --> 10:01.000
I, um, I have a class, like,
really early in the morning.

10:01.066 --> 10:02.066
Tomorrow morning.

10:02.133 --> 10:04.400
'It's okay,
we'll be back before breakfast.'

10:04.466 --> 10:06.133
'Mr. Franklin had a bit
too much to drink'

10:06.200 --> 10:08.966
'and I can't see a thing
at night.'

10:09.033 --> 10:11.333
'Thanks, Gina,
we'll make it up to you.'

10:11.400 --> 10:13.333
'Keep up the good work.'

10:14.600 --> 10:18.200
Oh, God, control, control.

10:19.866 --> 10:22.033
I'm totally losing control.

10:55.233 --> 10:57.733
'Where's our story?'

10:59.300 --> 11:02.300
We might as well
read it ourselves.

11:03.600 --> 11:06.633
"Once upon a time,
there was a little boy.."

11:07.966 --> 11:09.066
I'm coming.

11:09.133 --> 11:11.633
Um, wait for a minute.

11:11.700 --> 11:13.733
If I can get through that door.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.600
I didn't forget about you.

11:19.666 --> 11:22.833
Alright, I'm gonna read you
a story in a minute.

11:22.900 --> 11:24.833
I'll be right there.

11:26.900 --> 11:28.033
No.

11:30.633 --> 11:32.933
- Right there.
- 'Wait.'

11:34.933 --> 11:37.033
'You can't be full yet.'

11:40.666 --> 11:42.600
What? You've had your fun,
and now we're history?

11:42.666 --> 11:44.300
Low fiber, high fat.

11:44.366 --> 11:46.233
No one's perfect,
bubblehead.

11:46.300 --> 11:48.766
Yeah, who're you calling
heart attack food?

11:48.833 --> 11:50.266
'Roly-poly.'

11:50.333 --> 11:51.833
It's just an expression.

11:51.900 --> 11:53.633
- All is forgiven.
- Yeah, sure.

11:53.700 --> 11:57.000
- Come on over and finish us.
- You know you want to.

12:38.066 --> 12:39.833
'Okay, guys,
sorry I dozed off.'

12:39.900 --> 12:42.233
But I can read you
a story now.

12:44.966 --> 12:48.000
Come out, come out
wherever you are.

12:51.700 --> 12:54.533
Come on, guys.

12:54.600 --> 12:56.300
We can, uh..

12:56.366 --> 12:58.800
...play pin the tail
on the sitter.

12:58.866 --> 13:00.933
You'll love that.

13:03.100 --> 13:05.600
Olly olly oxen free?

13:05.666 --> 13:07.300
God, remind me
never to have kids.

13:10.600 --> 13:12.533
How about a snack?

13:14.266 --> 13:15.300
'Okay.'

13:20.566 --> 13:21.633
Mm.

13:26.366 --> 13:27.400
Great.

13:28.533 --> 13:30.533
Cute, guys.

13:30.600 --> 13:32.700
Really cute.

13:32.766 --> 13:35.133
'What kind of a game
are we playing now?'

13:36.733 --> 13:40.300
Alright, you guys.

13:40.366 --> 13:41.633
You got me.

13:41.700 --> 13:43.633
Ha-ha.

13:47.733 --> 13:50.133
Where are you guys?

14:05.400 --> 14:07.333
Play time is over.

14:13.300 --> 14:14.966
Dolly!

14:15.033 --> 14:17.933
Dolly, where are you?

14:21.933 --> 14:23.000
Hello.

14:23.066 --> 14:24.000
'Gina?'

14:24.066 --> 14:25.700
Oh, Mrs. Franklin.

14:25.766 --> 14:27.533
'Yes, I'm sorry
to bother you again.'

14:27.600 --> 14:29.800
'I forgot to say goodnight
to the children.'

14:29.866 --> 14:32.700
- 'Can you put them on?'
- Well, uh..

14:32.766 --> 14:35.000
It's too late,
they're fast asleep.

14:35.066 --> 14:37.233
'Before midnight?'

14:37.300 --> 14:41.800
'I'm glad you and the children
have reached an understanding.'

14:47.600 --> 14:50.133
It's just a phase.

14:52.433 --> 14:53.833
'Just one thing.'

14:53.900 --> 14:55.000
Yeah?

14:55.066 --> 14:56.900
'When you watch them..'

14:56.966 --> 14:58.900
'...watch yourself.'

15:07.033 --> 15:09.000
Where are you guys?

15:10.233 --> 15:12.733
Why are you doing this to me?

15:14.333 --> 15:15.766
Oh, God.

15:15.833 --> 15:17.466
Where are you-you?

15:17.533 --> 15:18.633
No.

15:20.366 --> 15:22.166
What did I do to deserve this?

15:22.233 --> 15:24.300
There's no food.

15:25.033 --> 15:27.233
No, no. No!

15:27.300 --> 15:28.333
No!

15:28.400 --> 15:30.066
No, not when I'm really hungry.

15:30.133 --> 15:32.100
Oh, God.

15:32.166 --> 15:33.700
Control, control.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.366
Control.

15:35.433 --> 15:36.600
Okay.

15:41.766 --> 15:43.466
'Workers Anonymous hotline.'

15:43.533 --> 15:44.766
Oh, thank God.

15:44.833 --> 15:47.066
I am totally out of control.

15:47.133 --> 15:49.633
I don't want to eat anymore.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.566
I don't want to be fat.

15:51.633 --> 15:53.666
- Again.
- 'Just keep calm, ma'am.'

15:53.733 --> 15:55.166
'Now, what I really think you
should do is proceed'

15:55.233 --> 15:56.366
'to the freezer in the basement'

15:56.433 --> 15:58.266
'and roast the side of beef
and eat it up.'

15:58.333 --> 15:59.433
'It's just a phase.'

15:59.500 --> 16:02.200
'Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.'

16:02.266 --> 16:03.400
Oh, God.

16:07.666 --> 16:08.833
Oh, God.

17:11.733 --> 17:14.066
You ate my big sister!

17:25.133 --> 17:26.500
No!

17:28.833 --> 17:30.833
Ricky.

17:31.866 --> 17:32.900
Ricky.

17:32.966 --> 17:35.500
Olly olly oxen free.

17:54.400 --> 17:55.400
'Ricky!'

17:57.900 --> 18:00.400
Ricky, come on, little buddy.

18:00.466 --> 18:03.366
Come on out,
I'm not gonna hurt ya.

18:03.433 --> 18:04.733
Just waste you a little.

18:07.866 --> 18:10.466
'Come on, Ricky.'

18:10.533 --> 18:13.933
'It's time for your story.'

18:19.566 --> 18:21.433
You
what I am..

18:21.500 --> 18:23.800
...so here I am.

18:26.066 --> 18:28.700
I smell finger food.

18:32.366 --> 18:34.200
You're not getting away.

18:42.200 --> 18:45.633
No one leaves until I'm full.

18:49.200 --> 18:52.100
Help! You have to send somebody.

18:52.166 --> 18:54.600
'Why bother? There's no way in.'

18:54.666 --> 18:55.733
Or out!

19:00.033 --> 19:02.700
It didn't have to be like this!

19:02.766 --> 19:04.733
Do you hear me?

19:05.666 --> 19:07.800
I was doing so well.

19:09.766 --> 19:11.133
You..

19:11.200 --> 19:13.533
And you played games with me.

19:14.533 --> 19:15.600
And you..

19:16.466 --> 19:18.900
You made me nervous!

19:18.966 --> 19:20.600
And..

19:20.666 --> 19:23.300
And you made me eat.

19:23.800 --> 19:24.800
And..

19:26.166 --> 19:28.233
You made me this.

19:30.700 --> 19:33.433
Roly-poly, fat and ugly!

19:33.500 --> 19:36.133
Roly-poly, fat and ugly!

19:36.200 --> 19:38.833
Roly-poly, fat and ugly!

19:38.900 --> 19:41.566
Roly-poly, fat and ugly!

19:41.633 --> 19:44.133
'Roly-poly, fat and ugly!'

19:44.200 --> 19:46.533
'Roly-poly, fat and ugly!'

19:46.600 --> 19:49.033
'Roly-poly, fat and ugly!'

19:49.100 --> 19:51.466
'Roly-poly, fat and ugly!'

19:51.533 --> 19:54.033
'Roly-poly, fat and ugly!'

19:54.100 --> 19:56.566
'Roly-poly, fat and ugly!'

19:56.633 --> 19:58.966
'Roly-poly, fat and ugly!'

19:59.033 --> 20:01.500
Roly-poly, fat and ugly!

21:22.133 --> 21:23.433
- 'Ricky?'
- 'Ricky!'

21:23.500 --> 21:24.933
'Ricky!'

21:25.000 --> 21:26.366
Here I am, mom.

21:26.433 --> 21:27.833
- Oh, thank God!
- Gina!

21:27.900 --> 21:29.233
Where's your sister?
Where is Gina?

21:29.300 --> 21:32.633
- Ricky.
- Gina! Gina!

21:32.700 --> 21:35.166
Gina, wake up.

21:35.233 --> 21:37.933
'Gina, wake up.'

21:38.000 --> 21:40.133
'Gina, wake up.'

21:40.200 --> 21:41.333
'Gina, wake up, honey.'

21:41.400 --> 21:43.066
- 'The sitter's here.'
- Mom!

21:43.133 --> 21:44.233
Gina, what's wrong?

21:44.300 --> 21:46.000
I was all grown up, mom.

21:46.066 --> 21:48.333
And I was sitting
for these two horrible kids.

21:48.400 --> 21:50.466
It's over, honey.
It was just a bad dream.

21:50.533 --> 21:52.700
I was&lt;

21:52.766 --> 21:54.433
Sweetie, you are beautiful.

21:54.500 --> 21:57.633
I was thin, mom.
Really thin.

21:57.700 --> 22:00.333
Oh, Gina, don't listen
to those kids at school

22:00.400 --> 22:01.866
when they tease you.

22:01.933 --> 22:04.100
This is just a phase.

22:07.666 --> 22:09.600
Here's the new sitter, baby.

22:10.900 --> 22:12.500
Hi, what's cookin'?

22:13.300 --> 22:15.233
Yummy.

22:17.100 --> 22:19.533
Maybe later you could
read Gina a story.

22:19.600 --> 22:20.933
- 'She likes that.'
- Oh, great!

22:21.000 --> 22:22.466
You know, I even brought one.

22:22.533 --> 22:24.500
Is, uh,
"Hansel And Gretel" okay?

22:39.833 --> 22:42.966
Little Gina
won't stay little for long.

22:43.033 --> 22:45.666
After all, you are who you eat.

23:08.400 --> 23:09.733
Gina..

23:11.400 --> 23:14.166
...you borrow my Walkman again?

23:14.233 --> 23:15.500
You want to do me a favor?

23:15.566 --> 23:18.466
Next time don't leave it
where daddy can step on it

23:18.533 --> 23:21.133
You can't just keep dropping
things wherever you like.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.133
Sorry, daddy.

23:23.200 --> 23:26.133
Someone got up
on the wrong side of bed.

23:26.200 --> 23:27.700
You know I've been working on
my brief for the last few weeks

23:27.766 --> 23:30.100
and I keep all my notes
on this thing.

23:30.166 --> 23:31.533
Ken!

23:36.800 --> 23:38.700
I understand
you're under pressure, babe

23:38.766 --> 23:42.000
butplease
try not to take it out on us.

23:42.066 --> 23:43.500
I'm just trying to work
on this case.

23:43.566 --> 23:45.300
It's very important.

23:45.366 --> 23:47.433
Might mean a partnership.
That's what you want, isn't it?

23:47.500 --> 23:50.633
You make it sound like
I forced you into law school.

23:50.700 --> 23:52.033
Well, let's just say

23:52.100 --> 23:54.966
it wasn't my first choice.

23:55.033 --> 23:57.500
Ah, look, Ken,
now is not the time

23:57.566 --> 23:59.133
to open that can of worms.

23:59.200 --> 24:01.433
I need you
to take Gina to school.

24:01.500 --> 24:03.133
What? You're kidding.

24:03.200 --> 24:05.000
I can't do that today,
I'm late already.

24:05.066 --> 24:06.600
One time
is not gonna kill you.

24:06.666 --> 24:08.233
I have a million things
to do today.

24:08.300 --> 24:09.333
Oh, and I don't?

24:09.400 --> 24:10.566
You know,
I'm really getting sick

24:10.633 --> 24:11.733
of being taken for granted

24:11.800 --> 24:13.266
Please, no whining.

24:13.333 --> 24:14.933
It is too early in the morning.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.066
Great, Cindy. You're right

24:17.133 --> 24:19.533
Men don't need any sympathy,
we should watch what we say..

24:19.600 --> 24:20.766
...and watch what we do..

24:20.833 --> 24:22.566
...spend our lives..

24:22.633 --> 24:24.833
...what, slaving
and breaking our backs.

24:24.900 --> 24:27.033
- Never complain.
- Ken, calm down.

24:27.100 --> 24:29.433
You should be happy
with what you have.

24:29.500 --> 24:30.866
Things could be much,
much worse.

24:30.933 --> 24:34.100
Yeah, well,
I feel like I'm in prison.

24:34.166 --> 24:36.166
What am I, 36 years old,
I have an earlier bedtime

24:36.233 --> 24:37.366
than when I was nine!

24:37.433 --> 24:39.000
My mother let me stay up
later than you do.

24:39.066 --> 24:40.633
Who are you kidding?

24:40.700 --> 24:43.433
You never want to go out.
You're always too tired.

24:43.500 --> 24:45.633
Yeah,
and did you ever wonder why?

24:45.700 --> 24:47.033
You think I like it?
Enjoy the grind everyday?

24:47.100 --> 24:48.066
Well, I don't.

24:48.133 --> 24:49.100
And, Cindy, no offence

24:49.166 --> 24:51.066
but on mornings like this..

24:51.133 --> 24:53.800
...I wouldn't mind
waking up being..

24:53.866 --> 24:55.666
...somebody else.

24:55.733 --> 24:58.700
Typical male mid-life bull.

24:58.766 --> 25:00.100
You want the single's life.

25:00.166 --> 25:02.066
Cruising the Caribbean
with some 20-year-old.

25:02.133 --> 25:03.533
Well, face it, Ken.

25:03.600 --> 25:06.833
You weren't cut out for life
in the fast lane.

25:06.900 --> 25:08.966
You don't even know
who I am anymore.

25:09.033 --> 25:11.000
I know what you're becoming.

25:11.800 --> 25:13.800
Uh, Ken..

25:26.300 --> 25:29.466
Br-r-reakfast of casualties!

25:29.533 --> 25:32.566
Yes, the fast lane is a dead end

25:32.633 --> 25:35.866
when you're stuck
on cruise control.

25:53.533 --> 25:55.600
'And if you need any proof
here's some comments'

25:55.666 --> 25:58.000
'from one of our satisfied
hair growth customers.'

26:23.000 --> 26:24.400
Drive, yappy..

26:24.466 --> 26:27.300
...or your complexion
gets a brand new look.

26:27.366 --> 26:28.800
What?

26:28.866 --> 26:30.400
Pretty please?

26:45.800 --> 26:48.066
This is nuts!

26:48.133 --> 26:50.100
What the hell am I charged with?

26:50.700 --> 26:52.266
Uh, Jesus.

26:52.333 --> 26:54.933
I want to know why I'm here.
I want to know right now.

26:56.366 --> 26:57.900
What's wrong with you guys?

26:57.966 --> 27:00.500
And where's my wallet? My ID?

27:00.566 --> 27:03.533
Just what did I do?

27:03.600 --> 27:04.900
Did you question the other guy?

27:04.966 --> 27:06.533
Huh? It's him you want.

27:06.600 --> 27:08.600
What other guy?

27:09.833 --> 27:12.233
Oh, it was the guy with..

27:12.300 --> 27:15.066
...with the Italian clothes.

27:15.133 --> 27:16.533
Yeah!

27:16.600 --> 27:17.866
They guy with..

27:17.933 --> 27:19.100
...with the gun!

27:19.166 --> 27:20.433
You're good.

27:20.500 --> 27:21.833
Realgood.

27:25.300 --> 27:27.133
I almost believed
there's another guy.

27:27.200 --> 27:28.166
Oh, but there was.

27:28.233 --> 27:29.400
- Smoke?
- No.

27:29.466 --> 27:31.466
I-I-I quit.

27:31.533 --> 27:33.833
Of course.

27:33.900 --> 27:36.566
Always the same story
with your type.

27:36.633 --> 27:39.066
Blame somebody else
for your situation.

27:39.133 --> 27:41.300
What situation?
I-I don't have a situation

27:41.366 --> 27:43.566
You had one. A good one.

27:43.633 --> 27:45.800
But you wanted out. Okay.

27:45.866 --> 27:47.933
Now you're in my situation.

27:48.933 --> 27:50.566
You wanted to be different

27:50.633 --> 27:53.433
Well,
welcome to the great equalizer.

27:56.066 --> 27:57.766
Uh, no, I-I had enough of this.

27:57.833 --> 27:59.900
Call my wife.

27:59.966 --> 28:02.500
Ca-call-call-call my office.
I-I, cal-call--

28:02.566 --> 28:04.700
Look, your kind thinks
you're in control?

28:04.766 --> 28:05.966
You make decisions
for the rest of us

28:06.033 --> 28:07.766
when you can't control yourself?

28:07.833 --> 28:10.533
You make me sick!

28:10.600 --> 28:13.533
- No phone calls for you!
- Wha.. Why?

28:14.866 --> 28:16.766
Take this joke to his cell

28:16.833 --> 28:18.833
Get him out of my sight!

28:19.833 --> 28:21.233
Oh.

28:29.066 --> 28:30.800
'I want a lawyer!'

28:30.866 --> 28:32.933
I.. Can you hear me?
I want a lawyer!

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
I want a lawyer right now!

28:36.300 --> 28:38.400
I want a lawyer right now!

28:52.000 --> 28:53.933
I'll confess!

28:54.700 --> 28:56.700
Just tell me what I did!

28:59.800 --> 29:01.333
'Your lady bailed you out.'

29:01.400 --> 29:03.333
'Yeah, my wife, thank God.'

29:09.633 --> 29:11.466
Where is she?

29:11.533 --> 29:13.500
Real comedian.

29:14.600 --> 29:16.400
So, Vinny.

29:16.466 --> 29:17.800
Miss me?

29:18.800 --> 29:20.233
Vinny?

29:21.666 --> 29:23.600
He's all yours.

29:38.100 --> 29:41.333
Thanks for getting me
out of that, uh...zoo.

29:41.400 --> 29:43.000
'Well, my wife must have taken
my daughter to school.'

29:43.066 --> 29:44.366
You can just drop me off
at the office.

29:47.200 --> 29:48.533
Come on, you can dump the act,
man.

29:48.600 --> 29:51.233
I'm not the cops, remember

29:51.300 --> 29:55.133
Well, didn't the office send you
to, uh, to get me?

29:57.366 --> 29:59.066
You're not, uh..

29:59.133 --> 30:00.600
You're not kidding, are you?

30:00.666 --> 30:02.133
Look, uh..

30:03.766 --> 30:05.733
I can't even focus, um..

30:07.200 --> 30:08.166
What is your name again?

30:08.233 --> 30:10.500
&nbsp;
Veryf

30:12.066 --> 30:14.100
It's Gina.

30:14.166 --> 30:16.100
You love my name, remember?

30:16.166 --> 30:18.200
That's my..
That's my daughters name.

30:19.400 --> 30:21.933
Daughter? Wow!

30:22.000 --> 30:23.966
Wait a minute, I've heard
of jail shaking people up a bit

30:24.033 --> 30:25.833
but, uh..

30:25.900 --> 30:28.033
...they really did
a number on you.

30:29.700 --> 30:31.633
Did they give you that suit?

30:49.533 --> 30:51.566
Help you?

30:51.633 --> 30:54.033
It's okay, Paul. It's me.

30:54.100 --> 30:55.833
Who's me?

30:55.900 --> 30:56.933
Franklin. Ken Franklin.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.866
This is my spot.
I'm here everyday.

30:58.933 --> 31:01.766
You're Franklin, I'm Cinderella.
Move it, ma'am.

31:01.833 --> 31:03.500
Mr. Franklin will be
in here soon.

31:03.566 --> 31:05.100
Paul.

31:05.166 --> 31:07.000
You ever have, uh..

31:07.066 --> 31:09.266
...one of those mornings?

31:09.333 --> 31:11.266
Well, I've just had
ten of 'em all rolled into one

31:11.333 --> 31:12.666
so let's just cut the comedy,
will you?

31:12.733 --> 31:16.133
I don't have a sense of humor.

31:16.200 --> 31:19.666
I am Ken Franklin.
I work here.

31:19.733 --> 31:21.533
Well, don't-don't
any of you know me?

31:22.366 --> 31:24.000
Franklin? Ken Franklin?

31:24.066 --> 31:26.833
Hey. Hey, look.
It's alright. Okay?

31:26.900 --> 31:29.400
It's alright.
I'll take him.

31:29.466 --> 31:31.533
Down, Vinny. Down.

31:34.033 --> 31:35.866
It's, uh..

31:35.933 --> 31:36.866
...it's, um, delayed stress.

31:36.933 --> 31:38.700
It's a terrible,
terrible thing.

31:42.133 --> 31:44.100
Take me to my house.

31:45.033 --> 31:46.033
My home.

32:08.866 --> 32:11.900
Oh, thank God.
Honey, I'm so glad to see you.

32:11.966 --> 32:13.800
They let you home early
from school today?

32:13.866 --> 32:16.000
- Mommy!
- What's the matter, honey?

32:16.066 --> 32:18.100
You're angry because
I didn't take you to school?

32:18.833 --> 32:20.900
Go inside, honey.

32:20.966 --> 32:23.100
- What do you want?
- Oh, Cindy.

32:24.966 --> 32:27.300
You're not gonna believe
what happened to me today.

32:27.366 --> 32:29.100
Who are you?

32:29.166 --> 32:31.466
How'd you know my name?

32:31.533 --> 32:32.800
What do you mean who am I?

32:32.866 --> 32:34.833
I-I'm your husband.

32:36.233 --> 32:38.466
Uh, look.

32:38.533 --> 32:40.000
Cindy, I know we had
a fight this morning

32:40.066 --> 32:41.533
but this is getting
so ridiculous.

32:41.600 --> 32:43.166
Get out of here.
Go away.

32:43.233 --> 32:45.700
I'm not going anywhere.

32:45.766 --> 32:47.200
This is my house.

32:47.266 --> 32:48.933
I need help.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.300
You're bothering
my wife and kid?

32:53.366 --> 32:56.133
Your wife and kid?

32:56.833 --> 32:57.966
Take a hike.

33:03.066 --> 33:04.733
Pretty please.

33:07.700 --> 33:09.033
You're that guy.

33:11.266 --> 33:13.233
You're that guy!

33:22.966 --> 33:25.033
Ready when you are, Vinny.

33:33.033 --> 33:35.000
Where are we now?

33:36.800 --> 33:39.433
Where do you think?

33:39.500 --> 33:41.433
Well, surprise me.

33:42.533 --> 33:44.600
Come on, Vinny.
This is your house.

33:45.733 --> 33:47.800
This is your empire.
You built this.

33:50.100 --> 33:54.000
Oh. Who is Vinny?

33:58.700 --> 33:59.733
Vinny?

34:06.333 --> 34:07.733
My lover.

34:26.033 --> 34:27.200
Hey!

34:28.600 --> 34:29.700
My keys.

34:30.766 --> 34:32.066
Yeah.

34:32.133 --> 34:33.666
You left them here
this morning.

34:33.733 --> 34:35.900
You left your wallet too.

34:37.666 --> 34:39.300
They're over here.

34:58.900 --> 35:00.533
These are my clothes.

35:00.600 --> 35:02.733
'What did you expect?'

35:06.700 --> 35:08.633
I don't know what to expect.

35:09.466 --> 35:11.333
I've misplaced my life.

35:12.166 --> 35:14.366
Oh. Cheer up.

35:14.433 --> 35:16.933
You don't need
to expect anything.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.066
That's what I love about you.

35:19.133 --> 35:20.366
You're so..

35:20.433 --> 35:22.633
...um, so spontaneous.

35:22.700 --> 35:24.500
Mr. Adventure.

35:25.600 --> 35:27.066
Uh, those pictures downstairs.

35:27.133 --> 35:29.333
I-I looked happy in them.
Was I happy when we took 'em?

35:29.400 --> 35:31.566
Oh, yeah.
Oh, you were very happy.

35:31.633 --> 35:34.066
You had just hit a big score.

35:34.133 --> 35:36.666
We were sailing off the Keys.

35:38.200 --> 35:40.233
And then, then you said
that your wife and kids

35:40.300 --> 35:42.366
were suckers.

35:42.433 --> 35:44.766
You haven't changed
your mind, have you?

35:44.833 --> 35:46.033
No.

35:46.100 --> 35:48.133
No, I haven't changed it.

35:49.233 --> 35:51.200
I've just lost it.

35:51.266 --> 35:52.333
Completely.

35:58.433 --> 36:00.433
Hey, this is mine.

36:01.400 --> 36:02.466
Information's all wrong though.

36:02.533 --> 36:05.033
It's...wrong address.

36:06.200 --> 36:08.200
Not if it's this address, babe.

36:15.633 --> 36:17.700
Oh.

36:17.766 --> 36:19.366
Sorry about your headphones,
but I told you

36:19.433 --> 36:20.566
not to put them
next to the bed

36:20.633 --> 36:25.000
especially because you
get so rough

36:25.066 --> 36:27.033
when it comes time
for bedtime.

36:27.666 --> 36:29.233
Me? Rough?

36:29.300 --> 36:32.233
Mm-hmm. You're an animal.

36:32.300 --> 36:34.033
Sexual beast.

36:34.833 --> 36:37.100
Oh.

36:37.166 --> 36:40.200
My poor little gem of a baby.

36:40.266 --> 36:42.733
You just get into
too much too soon.

36:44.166 --> 36:45.800
Yeah, I never thought
anything exciting

36:45.866 --> 36:47.833
would ever happen to me.

36:47.900 --> 36:49.866
I thought I'll just turn 50

36:49.933 --> 36:52.933
and...it'd be all over.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.900
Well, you don't have to worry
about that happening to you now.

36:58.633 --> 37:01.900
Because you're in all the way.

37:01.966 --> 37:04.100
It doesn't matter if you're in
all the way if you're lost.

37:04.166 --> 37:08.000
Well, then let me help you
out of the woods.

37:08.066 --> 37:09.500
Alright.

37:22.533 --> 37:24.500
He's all yours.

37:24.566 --> 37:27.033
Humped, primed and ready.

37:29.133 --> 37:30.333
Take him.

38:19.166 --> 38:21.100
Well, that was fast.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.533
I told you his kind
wouldn't be any trouble.

38:26.066 --> 38:27.433
He wasn't.

38:38.366 --> 38:40.533
I'm beginning to catch on
with my new life.

38:40.600 --> 38:43.266
You think I like the feeling
of this weapon in my hand?

38:43.333 --> 38:44.733
So don't do that again.

38:44.800 --> 38:47.000
Just let me go!

38:47.066 --> 38:49.066
I want answers.

38:49.133 --> 38:50.100
Now..

38:51.800 --> 38:53.366
...who are you?

38:53.433 --> 38:55.100
What's happening to me?

38:55.166 --> 38:56.300
Who's doing this?

38:56.366 --> 38:58.400
You did it to yourself.

38:59.566 --> 39:01.266
Who's life am I living?

39:01.333 --> 39:02.600
This isn't me.

39:02.666 --> 39:04.033
It's not my life.

39:04.100 --> 39:06.533
Don't you get it?

39:07.500 --> 39:09.800
You've made Vinny what he is.

39:09.866 --> 39:12.000
You made him up!

39:22.300 --> 39:23.933
Well, I-I-I was just 40 and I..

39:25.233 --> 39:27.733
I was p-pushing 40.

39:27.800 --> 39:31.100
I just, you know,
felt like I was in a rud.

39:31.166 --> 39:32.400
So I wanted to change.

39:32.466 --> 39:35.100
So, I was.. So I'm supposed
to die for it?

39:40.200 --> 39:42.200
They're all over the place.

39:42.966 --> 39:44.566
What have you done to me?

39:44.633 --> 39:47.200
'Ready, guys. Spread out.
Keep your eyes open.'

39:47.866 --> 39:49.100
Alright.

39:51.600 --> 39:53.500
You want out. You can get out.

39:53.566 --> 39:55.966
You can end it right now.
It's all your choice.

39:56.033 --> 39:57.366
'Look in here.'

39:59.433 --> 40:00.833
Right here.

40:02.466 --> 40:03.833
Keys to my car.

40:05.333 --> 40:07.400
Why should I trust you?

40:10.266 --> 40:11.400
Yeah?

40:11.466 --> 40:15.000
Because I'm the only game
in town, toots.

40:19.566 --> 40:21.366
The car's out back.

40:21.433 --> 40:23.433
Nobody waiting out there.

40:40.400 --> 40:42.933
He's taking the car.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.166
Relax.

40:44.233 --> 40:46.300
It'll be all over soon.

41:01.633 --> 41:03.333
I gotta rest.

41:05.066 --> 41:06.133
'Think.'

41:08.066 --> 41:10.833
Try my house again.

41:25.733 --> 41:27.833
'All units,
high speed pursuit of suspect'

41:27.900 --> 41:29.600
'proceeding
into residential area.'

41:29.666 --> 41:31.100
'Use caution. Repeat.'

41:31.166 --> 41:33.533
'All units,
high speed pursuit of suspect'

41:33.600 --> 41:34.700
'proceeding
into residential area.'

41:34.766 --> 41:36.900
- Which is not my problem.
- 'Use caution.'

41:40.233 --> 41:42.233
'Wait a second.'

41:42.300 --> 41:44.400
'Wait a second.
This is my neighborhood.'

41:46.100 --> 41:47.833
I'm home?

41:48.800 --> 41:50.833
I-I was miles from here.

42:07.666 --> 42:08.800
Ah!

42:11.100 --> 42:12.433
No brakes?

42:13.600 --> 42:15.033
Bitch!

42:57.900 --> 42:59.033
This one is fine.

42:59.100 --> 43:01.333
Let's check on the other guy.

43:08.100 --> 43:09.433
Hey.

43:09.500 --> 43:11.000
Hey!

43:11.066 --> 43:12.666
What about me?

43:12.733 --> 43:14.033
I'm hurt.

43:15.233 --> 43:16.233
Hey!

43:27.333 --> 43:28.433
He's finished.

43:31.733 --> 43:32.933
Let's cover him up.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.933
No.

43:37.433 --> 43:39.400
No, I'm alive.

43:39.466 --> 43:41.266
I'm fine.

43:41.333 --> 43:44.000
Hey, I'm right here!

43:44.066 --> 43:46.033
I said, "I'm right here."

43:46.100 --> 43:47.933
This isn't me.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.233
This isn't me.

43:49.300 --> 43:52.400
This isn't me.
This isn't me.

43:53.300 --> 43:55.233
This isn't me.

43:55.300 --> 43:56.800
I'm alive.

43:56.866 --> 43:58.300
This isn't me.

43:58.366 --> 43:59.933
Don't you understand?

44:01.300 --> 44:02.900
This isn't me.

44:02.966 --> 44:04.533
I want my life back.

44:04.600 --> 44:06.033
My old life.

44:06.800 --> 44:08.133
My old life.

44:08.200 --> 44:10.533
I want my old life back.

44:10.600 --> 44:11.600
My old life.

44:11.666 --> 44:12.933
'Clear.'

44:14.966 --> 44:16.500
'Clear.'

44:18.566 --> 44:20.033
We got him.
He's back.

44:20.100 --> 44:22.666
My old life.
I want my old life back.

44:22.733 --> 44:24.300
- My old life.
- Oh, God.

44:24.366 --> 44:26.366
Oh, Cindy.

44:26.433 --> 44:28.733
Oh, Cindy,
you're my wife, right?

44:28.800 --> 44:30.633
Forever.

44:30.700 --> 44:32.966
Oh, Ken. It-it was terrible.

44:33.033 --> 44:36.100
- 'What happened?'
- I was taking Gina to school.

44:36.166 --> 44:37.833
And we saw you hit that car.

44:37.900 --> 44:40.533
How's the car?
The car.

44:41.833 --> 44:44.200
The cops were
on a high speed pursuit.

44:44.266 --> 44:46.600
They chased the suspect,
Vinny Lefia

44:46.666 --> 44:48.000
through the intersection.

44:48.066 --> 44:50.933
And he hit this man,
Mr. Ken Franklin.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.400
355, Elm Street.

44:53.466 --> 44:54.700
'Radio it in.'

44:54.766 --> 44:56.733
'Tell them
we have a crash victim.'

44:56.800 --> 44:58.466
'And the suspect was DOA.'

45:11.266 --> 45:13.600
Remember, the life you save..

45:15.233 --> 45:17.200
...maybe your own.
