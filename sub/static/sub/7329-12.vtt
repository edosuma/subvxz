WEBVTT

00:42.476 --> 00:44.321
You were a little hot
on the approach, Sayif.

00:44.345 --> 00:46.856
Oh, come on,
I put it right on the numbers.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.191
You do that on your check ride,

00:48.215 --> 00:49.726
- you're going to lose points, man.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.161
No hotdogging.

00:51.185 --> 00:52.929
- Everything by the book.
- Get the car, Walid.

00:52.953 --> 00:54.331
I'll only be
a couple of minutes.

00:54.355 --> 00:55.999
Yes, Your Highness.

00:56.023 --> 00:59.002
Wish I had someone like that
to run my errands.

00:59.026 --> 01:01.392
Walid doesn't get his act
together, you can have him.

01:49.209 --> 01:51.821
For the last time, my name
is Anthony DiNozzo Jr.

01:51.845 --> 01:54.658
My father is Anthony DiNozzo Sr.

01:54.682 --> 01:56.626
I live in Washington, DC.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.695
He lives in New York City.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.330
Is that so complicated?

02:00.354 --> 02:01.464
Junior, Senior.

02:01.488 --> 02:02.999
Can you follow that?

02:03.023 --> 02:04.467
What is going on?

02:04.491 --> 02:07.137
Tony's trying to withdraw money
from a bank in New York.

02:07.161 --> 02:08.738
Sounds like they confused
his account

02:08.762 --> 02:11.708
with one of his father's,
and he can't get the money.

02:11.732 --> 02:12.909
Let me get this straight.

02:12.933 --> 02:15.111
You want me to spell
my name again?

02:15.135 --> 02:16.613
Okay.

02:16.637 --> 02:19.282
It's big "D," as in "dimwit."
Little "I," as in "idiot."

02:19.306 --> 02:20.917
Big "N," as in "nimrod."

02:20.941 --> 02:22.619
Little "O," as in "obtuse."

02:22.643 --> 02:23.853
What does he need the money for?

02:23.877 --> 02:25.522
Double "Z,"
as in "ZZ Top," or maybe...

02:25.546 --> 02:27.757
Well, he and a couple
of his frat buddies

02:27.781 --> 02:30.427
have decided to take
a cruise this spring.

02:30.451 --> 02:31.761
No, I'm not kidding!

02:31.785 --> 02:33.596
I'm sure that won't lead
to any trouble.

02:33.620 --> 02:34.731
Clean, wholesome fun.

02:34.755 --> 02:36.132
Put your supervisor
on the line... now!

02:36.156 --> 02:37.667
Why doesn't he just
call his father

02:37.691 --> 02:38.968
to straighten things out?

02:38.992 --> 02:40.070
Yes, I'll hold.

02:40.094 --> 02:41.071
Mind your own business.

02:41.095 --> 02:42.939
Ooh, grouchy.

02:42.963 --> 02:45.408
Left a message
for his father two days ago.

02:45.432 --> 02:47.243
Tony hasn't heard back from him.

02:47.267 --> 02:49.412
Oh, you would like me
to spell my name for you again?

02:49.436 --> 02:51.414
Are you guys in India?

02:51.438 --> 02:52.415
DiNozzo, get off the phone.

02:52.439 --> 02:53.683
Got a dead foreign national.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.085
Pax River. Let's go.

02:55.109 --> 02:56.286
Pax River?

02:56.310 --> 02:59.279
Weren't we just there?

03:01.014 --> 03:03.626
Where are you going
on your cruise?

03:03.650 --> 03:05.128
It's need-to-know information.

03:05.152 --> 03:06.529
You don't need to know.

03:06.553 --> 03:08.665
Aren't you too old
for spring break?

03:08.689 --> 03:10.667
No.

03:10.691 --> 03:15.271
Boss, car is registered to
Beltway Executive Auto Leasing.

03:15.295 --> 03:18.775
Rented to a Prince
Sayif Ibn Alwaan

03:18.799 --> 03:21.411
on a month-to-month.

03:21.435 --> 03:23.279
Hope he got the full coverage.

03:23.303 --> 03:28.184
Appears an explosive device
was placed under the car.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.854
Get the vehicle to Abby.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.856
The victim is Walid Abbas.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.958
He entered the U.S.
on a visitor's visa.

03:34.982 --> 03:37.327
He worked for the prince
as his driver.

03:37.351 --> 03:40.930
You know, there are over 7,000
princes in the royal family.

03:40.954 --> 03:42.499
What do you got, Duck?

03:42.523 --> 03:44.267
- Tell me anything I don't know?
- Well, yes.

03:44.291 --> 03:46.703
He wasn't killed
by the explosion.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.271
At least not directly.

03:48.295 --> 03:51.074
There are no burns
or blistering on his...

03:51.098 --> 03:53.276
the skin of his hands.

03:53.300 --> 03:56.346
Cause of death was most likely
blunt-force trauma

03:56.370 --> 03:58.581
when his head hit the tarmac.

03:58.605 --> 04:00.917
I've heard the saying
"He got blown out of his shoes,"

04:00.941 --> 04:03.052
- but I never thought I'd see it.
- No.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.088
If the explosion had knocked
his socks off,

04:05.112 --> 04:08.425
that would be impressive,
wouldn't it?

04:08.449 --> 04:10.660
How long has Prince Sayif been
in the country?

04:10.684 --> 04:12.095
Almost three months.

04:12.119 --> 04:13.630
He's attached
to the Navy-Marine Corps'

04:13.654 --> 04:15.198
Strike Pilot Training Program.

04:15.222 --> 04:18.000
- Where is he?
- Last I saw Sayif, he was in the hangar.

04:18.024 --> 04:20.536
You've been his flight
instructor the whole time?

04:20.560 --> 04:22.038
Oh, no,
he's been through several.

04:22.062 --> 04:24.941
I've only had the pleasure
for the past, uh, couple weeks.

04:24.965 --> 04:26.109
I detect some... friction.

04:26.133 --> 04:27.410
Let's just say

04:27.434 --> 04:29.612
that I hope he doesn't screw up
on his check ride.

04:29.636 --> 04:31.714
That way, he'll graduate the day
after tomorrow with his class,

04:31.738 --> 04:34.141
and he won't be
our problem anymore.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.462
I was just making arrangements
to be picked up.

04:45.486 --> 04:48.264
Cancel them.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.700
Don't want to jump
to conclusions here,

04:50.724 --> 04:53.536
but we have to assume that
that bomb was meant for you.

04:53.560 --> 04:56.806
Until we know otherwise, you're
under our protective custody.

04:56.830 --> 04:59.442
Yeah. I don't think so.

04:59.466 --> 05:02.745
Look, I am sorry about Walid,
Agent Gibbs,

05:02.769 --> 05:06.049
but if you know anything
about the Saudi royal family,

05:06.073 --> 05:08.051
assassinations are
a part of our lives.

05:08.075 --> 05:10.119
I came to the United States
for flight training,

05:10.143 --> 05:12.388
and I'm not going to let
what happened stop me.

05:12.412 --> 05:15.658
Okay. I have no influence
with your country.

05:15.682 --> 05:17.727
But I do
with the United States Navy,

05:17.751 --> 05:20.413
and I'll have your training
stopped immediately.

05:22.623 --> 05:26.269
Okay, protective custody
on my terms.

05:26.293 --> 05:28.137
I'm not going to be sequestered
on any base

05:28.161 --> 05:30.573
or in a government safe house.

05:30.597 --> 05:32.442
I'm staying at the presidential
suite at the Adams House.

05:32.466 --> 05:37.413
If you would like
to protect me there...

05:37.437 --> 05:39.428
you are welcome to.

05:44.912 --> 05:46.589
I've been in contact

05:46.613 --> 05:48.024
with the Saudi embassy.

05:48.048 --> 05:51.594
They insist their Royal Guards
be part of the security detail.

05:51.618 --> 05:54.063
We'll coordinate with them.

05:54.087 --> 05:55.999
Where is Prince Sayif now?

05:56.023 --> 05:57.166
He's here.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.801
We brought him back
to the Navy yard

05:58.825 --> 06:01.037
while his suite and adjoining
rooms are being cleared.

06:01.061 --> 06:02.372
Agent Gibbs.

06:02.396 --> 06:03.540
Ma'am.

06:03.564 --> 06:07.277
Al Jazeera is reporting
that Jihad Al Hurriya

06:07.301 --> 06:10.680
is claiming responsibility
for the assassination attempt.

06:10.704 --> 06:11.848
You aware of them?

06:11.872 --> 06:15.451
Yes. It translates
to "Freedom Warriors."

06:15.475 --> 06:17.186
They're an offshoot
of the Mujahideen.

06:17.210 --> 06:20.089
Didn't know they had a presence
here in the United States.

06:20.113 --> 06:22.492
Don't know.
NSA is checking into it.

06:22.516 --> 06:23.493
You questioned Sayif.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.762
Did he mention Jihad Al Hurriya?

06:25.786 --> 06:29.265
No. He didn't seem too concerned

06:29.289 --> 06:31.534
about the incident
either, ma'am.

06:31.558 --> 06:32.969
The Saudi ambassador assured me

06:32.993 --> 06:35.705
that Prince Sayif
will be leaving the country

06:35.729 --> 06:37.740
as soon as he graduates
from flight training.

06:37.764 --> 06:40.543
So he's only our problem
for two more days, then.

06:40.567 --> 06:43.012
His father Prince Omar
is a major player

06:43.036 --> 06:44.013
in the royal family.

06:44.037 --> 06:45.481
We need to be kept in the loop.

06:45.505 --> 06:46.583
Yes, ma'am.

06:46.607 --> 06:49.075
Let's call the embassy
from my office.

06:50.210 --> 06:52.188
You need me?

06:52.212 --> 06:53.189
Uh, no, boss.

06:53.213 --> 06:54.857
Just got to tell
Tony here something.

06:54.881 --> 06:56.872
What?

06:58.418 --> 07:00.363
You have a visitor.

07:00.387 --> 07:01.631
- Who?
- You'll see.

07:01.655 --> 07:04.200
- Tell me.
- No.

07:04.224 --> 07:05.748
What's the matter with you?

07:14.267 --> 07:15.612
Junior mentioned you.

07:15.636 --> 07:18.281
But he never told me
what you look like.

07:18.305 --> 07:21.384
You are stunning,

07:21.408 --> 07:23.119
Ziva.

07:23.143 --> 07:26.010
Do you ever think
of wearing your hair down?

07:34.254 --> 07:35.965
Junior.

07:35.989 --> 07:38.735
Dad.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.750
What are you doing here?

07:47.342 --> 07:48.577
I just want
this mix-up at the bank

07:48.601 --> 07:50.012
straightened out, all right?

07:50.036 --> 07:54.116
I mean, why is your name still
on the account as a trustee?

07:54.140 --> 07:55.951
Not to worry.
I'll-I'll take care of it.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.353
All right, well, you know,

07:57.377 --> 07:59.488
you could have just done it
with a phone call.

07:59.512 --> 08:01.957
Sure, and I will.

08:01.981 --> 08:05.594
It's, uh... just that we haven't
seen each other in a long time.

08:05.618 --> 08:07.797
And you thought you'd just
fly down and surprise me?

08:07.821 --> 08:09.982
Well, I took the train.
It's not that far.

08:11.658 --> 08:12.835
You all right?

08:12.859 --> 08:14.970
Never felt better.

08:14.994 --> 08:17.606
I mean, nothing's wrong?

08:17.630 --> 08:19.120
We'll have dinner, catch up.

08:22.035 --> 08:25.648
So, um, tell me about Ziva.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.750
Ziva is Ziva. Nothing to tell.

08:27.774 --> 08:29.185
Tony!

08:29.209 --> 08:30.986
Hotel suite's been cleared.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.922
- We're headed over.
- Be right there.

08:32.946 --> 08:37.126
Isn't that
Prince Sayif Ibn Alwaan?

08:37.150 --> 08:40.261
Yes, it is. Where you staying?

08:40.285 --> 08:43.299
My God. He has grown up.

08:43.323 --> 08:45.000
Dad.

08:45.024 --> 08:46.602
How do you know him?

08:46.626 --> 08:49.705
His father... Prince Omar... and I
have been in business together.

08:49.729 --> 08:51.173
We met years ago in Monte Carlo.

08:51.197 --> 08:54.543
What's Sayif doing here?

08:54.567 --> 08:56.045
Well, he was the target

08:56.069 --> 08:58.647
of an assassination attempt
this morning.

08:58.671 --> 09:00.549
Hey, should I continue
holding the door?

09:00.573 --> 09:02.785
I'm coming!
I'll meet you in the garage!

09:02.809 --> 09:04.120
Take it easy!

09:04.144 --> 09:05.144
What happened?

09:08.481 --> 09:10.005
I can't talk about it.

09:12.819 --> 09:15.164
Car bomb.

09:15.188 --> 09:17.633
Has his father been told?

09:17.657 --> 09:20.569
Yes. He's, uh, flying
in from Riyadh.

09:20.593 --> 09:23.973
Look, I have to get Sayif
to the Adams House Hotel.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.988
I'll take you downstairs,
get you a cab.

09:28.968 --> 09:32.815
Are you sure, uh, you don't
want to tell me something?

09:32.839 --> 09:36.741
You're-You're busy. It can wait.

09:48.521 --> 09:50.332
Who's that with Sayif?

09:50.356 --> 09:52.868
It's his older brother
Prince Abdalla.

09:52.892 --> 09:55.204
Lives here in DC.

09:55.228 --> 09:57.573
He's a deputy minister
at the Saudi embassy.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.675
They do not know I speak Arabic.

09:59.699 --> 10:01.134
Oh, good.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.281
Sayif is getting chewed
out for his Western ways.

10:05.305 --> 10:06.715
His brother believes

10:06.739 --> 10:09.409
that his pleasure-seeking
lifestyle brought on the attack.

10:10.977 --> 10:13.913
That is
too disgusting to translate.

10:16.316 --> 10:20.996
I apologize
for the family disagreement.

10:21.020 --> 10:23.666
Prince Abdalla,
this is Special Agent Gibbs.

10:23.690 --> 10:26.302
Pleasure.

10:26.326 --> 10:28.938
What happened
this morning is very disturbing,

10:28.962 --> 10:31.907
not only for the assassination
attempt on my brother

10:31.931 --> 10:34.643
but the tragic death of Walid.

10:34.667 --> 10:38.847
He was not only Sayif's aide
but a family friend.

10:38.871 --> 10:40.649
You think that Jihad Al Hurriya
was involved?

10:40.673 --> 10:41.884
It's very possible.

10:41.908 --> 10:44.172
They are the sworn enemy
of our government.

10:45.612 --> 10:46.855
Hey, boss.

10:46.879 --> 10:48.524
We got agents posted
in the lobby and the garage.

10:48.548 --> 10:49.758
The Royal Guards

10:49.782 --> 10:51.393
are covering the stairwells
and the corridors.

10:51.417 --> 10:52.528
Excuse me.

10:52.552 --> 10:53.596
Where do you think you're going?

10:53.620 --> 10:55.364
Fitness center.

10:55.388 --> 10:57.399
I'm afraid not; We have
to make sure it's secure,

10:57.423 --> 10:59.134
and you need
to be accompanied by an agent.

10:59.158 --> 11:02.171
Fine.

11:02.195 --> 11:04.186
I choose her.

11:10.236 --> 11:12.681
Oh, Jethro, I was just
about to call you.

11:12.705 --> 11:16.585
X-rays confirm
my initial determination.

11:16.609 --> 11:19.388
Blunt-force trauma was
indeed the cause of death.

11:19.412 --> 11:20.756
I'll be sure to tell him.

11:20.780 --> 11:23.192
Oh! Director Vance.

11:23.216 --> 11:26.729
It's not often that I'm graced
by your presence in Autopsy.

11:26.753 --> 11:28.697
To what do I owe the pleasure?

11:28.721 --> 11:30.466
Gibbs and I spoke
to the Saudi embassy.

11:30.490 --> 11:33.836
They have requested
a quick release of the body

11:33.860 --> 11:35.571
for religious reasons.

11:35.595 --> 11:37.873
Well, as soon as I'm done here,
I can make arrangements

11:37.897 --> 11:39.341
for him to be picked up.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.510
Thank you.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.161
Doctor?

11:44.203 --> 11:45.381
How's your mother doing?

11:45.405 --> 11:48.183
Thank you for asking.

11:48.207 --> 11:52.321
She is, uh,
slipping away slowly,

11:52.345 --> 11:54.523
losing touch with reality.

11:54.547 --> 11:57.226
When I visited her this morning,
in her room,

11:57.250 --> 12:01.664
she insisted that the clock
on the wall was going backwards.

12:01.688 --> 12:05.556
Actually, I've had days
that felt like that.

12:10.697 --> 12:12.995
Haven't we all?

12:16.069 --> 12:17.746
Abby, what are you doing?

12:17.770 --> 12:19.281
Don't say it, Gibbs. I know.

12:19.305 --> 12:20.849
My shoes and socks.

12:20.873 --> 12:23.552
It's "Mismatch Monday."

12:23.576 --> 12:25.854
- For who?
- For me.

12:25.878 --> 12:28.457
How about it's
"Make My Day Monday" for me?

12:28.481 --> 12:30.893
Okay, I am searching for
the signature of a bomb maker.

12:30.917 --> 12:34.096
I found fragments of a bomb
and I think it's homemade.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.798
Why?

12:35.822 --> 12:39.001
Because my schnozola
has detected a trace

12:39.025 --> 12:40.135
of nitromethane.

12:40.159 --> 12:42.071
I heard Tony's father
is in town.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.106
Yeah, he is. What triggered it?

12:44.130 --> 12:45.441
I found remnants of a timer.

12:45.465 --> 12:46.742
I'm hoping to find more.

12:46.766 --> 12:47.810
What does he look like?

12:47.834 --> 12:49.578
- Who?
- Tony's father!

12:49.602 --> 12:51.347
I haven't seen him.
Anything else?

12:51.371 --> 12:53.148
Yeah, I'm wondering
if Tony and him have

12:53.172 --> 12:54.416
the same sense of humor.

12:54.440 --> 12:55.784
I'm wondering if you're
gonna focus on the case.

12:55.808 --> 12:57.119
Right. Um...

12:57.143 --> 12:58.587
Okay, so I salvaged

12:58.611 --> 13:00.389
the vehicle's
on board nav system.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.658
I'm gonna download the data to a hard drive.-

13:02.682 --> 13:03.959
And, uh, hopefully,

13:03.983 --> 13:06.061
the little magical zeros
and ones will let us know

13:06.085 --> 13:07.763
- where the vehicle's been and when.
- Yeah. Gibbs.

13:07.787 --> 13:11.467
- In MTAC, boss.
- Right, McGee. Be right there.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.118
Thanks, Abbs.

13:16.229 --> 13:19.408
Echelon's picking up chatter,
emanating in real time

13:19.432 --> 13:21.610
from the Washington, DC,
metropolitan area.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.412
This is Barry Kester with NSA.

13:23.436 --> 13:24.580
Special Agent Gibbs.

13:24.604 --> 13:27.216
Hey. We locked on the IP address

13:27.240 --> 13:29.251
of the computer sending
the message.

13:29.275 --> 13:32.087
Could be a Jihad Al Hurriya
operative in the area.

13:32.111 --> 13:33.555
Have a location in a second.

13:33.579 --> 13:36.125
Key words intercepted
were "Prince Omar,"

13:36.149 --> 13:38.427
"assassination,"
"contract," and "killer."

13:38.451 --> 13:39.995
We got it.

13:40.019 --> 13:41.697
Computer is in
the guest business center

13:41.721 --> 13:43.298
of the Adams House.

13:43.322 --> 13:45.367
That's where we're keeping
Prince Sayif.

13:45.391 --> 13:47.382
I'll take the stairs.

13:55.668 --> 13:56.879
Hey! Hey!

13:56.903 --> 13:58.113
Where's the business center?

13:58.137 --> 14:00.282
- What?
- The business center! Where is it?

14:00.306 --> 14:02.184
Oh, uh, down that corridor,
on the left.

14:02.208 --> 14:04.199
Okay!

14:05.778 --> 14:07.656
Where is
the guest business center?

14:07.680 --> 14:09.224
- Uh... Ju...
- Where?!

14:09.248 --> 14:11.050
- Um, right down there.
- Okay!

14:24.497 --> 14:26.192
Federal agents. Hands in the air.-

14:27.733 --> 14:29.812
Junior, what's the matter
with you?

14:29.836 --> 14:31.213
Put that thing down.

14:31.237 --> 14:33.228
Someone could get hurt.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.900
Maybe Tony didn't have a mother.

14:51.924 --> 14:54.703
Maybe he was cloned.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.457
Well, there certainly is
a strong familial resemblance.

15:02.668 --> 15:05.347
Hi. Jethro Gibbs.

15:05.371 --> 15:08.250
Oh. Agent Gibbs.

15:08.274 --> 15:12.611
Well, you finally get
to meet the real Tony DiNozzo.

15:15.247 --> 15:17.893
I didn't expect it was going
to be under these circumstances.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.861
Have a seat.

15:19.885 --> 15:21.876
You've got
some explaining to do.

15:23.456 --> 15:27.636
Well, I was just, uh, e-mailing
some of my business associates...

15:27.660 --> 15:31.173
I'm developing a resort
on St. Bart's.

15:31.197 --> 15:33.375
Um, Junior wouldn't explain,

15:33.399 --> 15:36.278
but, uh, what warranted guns
being pointed in my face

15:36.302 --> 15:38.280
and being brought down here
for questioning?

15:38.304 --> 15:41.650
You used certain key words
that were picked up

15:41.674 --> 15:43.251
on a global
surveillance network.

15:43.275 --> 15:45.854
Monitors,
voice and data transmissions.

15:45.878 --> 15:47.422
Wow.

15:47.446 --> 15:49.081
That stuff really exists?

15:50.716 --> 15:52.360
I thought that was
only in spy movies.

15:52.384 --> 15:53.595
How does it work?

15:53.619 --> 15:55.630
It's classified.

15:57.123 --> 16:00.923
This where you bring the, uh,
bad guys for the third degree?

16:05.264 --> 16:08.376
You mentioned "Prince Omar"
and "assassination"

16:08.400 --> 16:10.112
in your e-mails. Why?

16:10.136 --> 16:12.581
I confess.

16:12.605 --> 16:15.150
I'm a bit of an opportunist.

16:15.174 --> 16:17.419
Uh, money's tight these days,

16:17.443 --> 16:19.521
and I'm missing
a key piece of financing.

16:19.545 --> 16:23.158
So I thought that fate
had interceded when I heard

16:23.182 --> 16:24.979
that Al was going to be in town.

16:26.018 --> 16:27.996
Al?

16:28.020 --> 16:29.698
Oh, yeah, that's what.

16:29.722 --> 16:33.735
Prince Omar Ibn Alwaan's
friends call him... yeah.

16:33.759 --> 16:35.937
So I was notifying
some of my investors

16:35.961 --> 16:38.406
that, uh, Al was going
to be in town

16:38.430 --> 16:40.575
because of the
assassination attempt

16:40.599 --> 16:43.445
on his son.

16:43.469 --> 16:46.081
Ah. Why are you
at the Adams House?

16:46.105 --> 16:47.315
Oh, I'm staying there.

16:47.339 --> 16:50.085
It's my favorite in Washington.

16:50.109 --> 16:51.653
Donald... the concierge...

16:51.677 --> 16:53.188
he's a miracle worker.

16:53.212 --> 16:54.656
He can get you
anything you want:

16:54.680 --> 16:57.359
Theater tickets,
restaurant reservations...

16:57.383 --> 17:01.663
Have you ever been
to the Rooftop Grill?

17:01.687 --> 17:03.331
No.

17:03.355 --> 17:07.301
Oh... They've got
the best rib eye in town.

17:07.326 --> 17:08.703
He's right about that.

17:08.727 --> 17:11.820
It is delicious.

17:18.069 --> 17:21.249
You keep your father clear
of the Ibn Alwaan family.

17:21.272 --> 17:22.851
Right, boss.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.752
Make sure he gets the message.

17:24.777 --> 17:26.768
Got it.

17:30.482 --> 17:32.427
- Abby.
- Gibbs! Hi, Gibbs.

17:32.451 --> 17:33.595
- Hi.
- Um...

17:33.619 --> 17:34.830
I just... I wanted to see

17:34.854 --> 17:36.398
what Tony's dad
looked like, but...

17:36.422 --> 17:38.233
- Go.
- I'm just gonna go.

17:38.257 --> 17:39.986
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

17:44.663 --> 17:45.891
Okay, Dad.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.478
TONY SR.: Junior.

17:50.502 --> 17:52.914
What are you thinking?

17:52.938 --> 17:54.816
- He's not involved.
- But?

17:54.840 --> 17:56.618
But he's got an agenda.

17:56.642 --> 17:58.166
Agreed.

18:00.312 --> 18:02.371
Thanks.

18:07.553 --> 18:10.065
Macallan 18, three fingers,
one ice cube.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.334
Hmm. You remembered.

18:12.358 --> 18:14.703
Well, what would
cocktail hour be

18:14.727 --> 18:17.739
without a single-malt scotch
and a lecture from Senior?

18:17.763 --> 18:21.076
And now you're going
to lecture me?

18:21.100 --> 18:23.478
What are you drinking?

18:23.502 --> 18:25.847
Nonalcoholic beer.

18:28.374 --> 18:30.535
The downside to law enforcement.

18:31.777 --> 18:33.655
Are there any upsides?

18:33.679 --> 18:35.306
Well, I get to carry a gun.

18:40.185 --> 18:42.264
You've always been disappointed
I became a cop.

18:42.288 --> 18:44.065
No.

18:44.089 --> 18:46.568
Felt that way to me.

18:46.592 --> 18:50.005
I always, uh, was supportive.

18:50.029 --> 18:51.606
I never said anything.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.575
Exactly.

18:53.599 --> 18:55.644
What did you want me to say?

18:55.668 --> 18:56.811
Well, I don't know.

18:56.835 --> 18:58.246
Maybe like, uh, "Hey, Junior,

18:58.270 --> 18:59.814
"I'm glad you found a career
you're passionate about.

18:59.838 --> 19:01.483
I'm proud of you
and what you're doing."

19:01.507 --> 19:02.684
Something like that.

19:02.708 --> 19:04.753
How do you know
I don't feel that way?

19:04.777 --> 19:06.711
How would I? We never talked.

19:09.548 --> 19:11.259
I mean...

19:11.283 --> 19:12.910
I get it.

19:14.420 --> 19:17.666
It must have been tough.

19:17.690 --> 19:20.535
Your wife dies, and you're left
with an eight-year-old kid.

19:20.559 --> 19:23.038
But your solution, Dad,
was to warehouse me

19:23.062 --> 19:24.372
in boarding schools
and summer camps.

19:24.396 --> 19:26.508
And half the time,
I never knew where you were

19:26.532 --> 19:27.590
or what you were doing.

19:29.601 --> 19:33.615
I needed a closer relationship.

19:33.639 --> 19:35.483
You forget.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.719
We took some great vacations
together.

19:37.743 --> 19:39.988
Like the trip to Maui
where you left me

19:40.012 --> 19:41.556
in a hotel room for two days,

19:41.580 --> 19:43.291
and I was 12 years old?

19:43.315 --> 19:44.526
Oh, come on, Junior.

19:44.550 --> 19:46.661
I explained that to you.

19:46.685 --> 19:50.432
I had to go back
to the mainland to close a deal.

19:50.456 --> 19:52.467
With a rich divorcée.

19:52.491 --> 19:54.736
Who was, uh, very attractive,

19:54.760 --> 19:56.404
as I recall.

19:56.428 --> 19:58.073
A deal is a deal.

19:58.097 --> 20:01.242
How's my current stepmother?

20:01.266 --> 20:03.778
Ex-stepmother.

20:03.802 --> 20:07.282
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

20:07.306 --> 20:08.750
I actually liked Karen.

20:08.774 --> 20:10.435
Phoebe.

20:11.710 --> 20:12.921
You missed one.

20:12.945 --> 20:15.090
Were you going
to tell me about that?

20:15.114 --> 20:19.244
I don't like to advertise
my failures.

20:21.553 --> 20:22.864
Well, my condolences.

20:22.888 --> 20:24.532
My congratulations.

20:24.556 --> 20:26.183
And my condolences.

20:27.259 --> 20:29.454
Thank you.

20:40.973 --> 20:44.219
I have to relieve Ziva.
Now, listen...

20:44.243 --> 20:47.322
you stay away
from the Ibn Alwaans.

20:47.346 --> 20:49.007
Please.

20:50.215 --> 20:52.206
I'll call you.

20:59.058 --> 21:02.437
Sayif's rented car went in
for its 10,000-mile service

21:02.461 --> 21:03.638
the day before the explosion.

21:03.662 --> 21:05.106
The dealership was losing tools,

21:05.130 --> 21:09.177
so they installed surveillance
cameras to cover all the bays.

21:09.201 --> 21:12.580
Now, the mechanic didn't see
anything unusual on the vehicle.

21:12.604 --> 21:14.349
And, as you can see,

21:14.373 --> 21:17.218
nothing was placed under it
while it was there.

21:17.242 --> 21:19.687
We backgrounded the mechanic...
he is clean...

21:19.711 --> 21:22.524
so the explosive device had
to be planted on the vehicle

21:22.548 --> 21:23.792
after it left the dealership.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.527
I'm gonna focus
on that time period.

21:25.551 --> 21:26.795
Hey, how'd it go at the hotel?

21:26.819 --> 21:31.533
Prince Sayif is a chauvinistic,
royal pain in the tush.

21:31.557 --> 21:33.368
Well, he's not used
to anyone saying no to him.

21:33.392 --> 21:35.136
You may have to hire someone
to protect him from me.

21:35.160 --> 21:36.438
Gibbs.

21:36.462 --> 21:37.705
I just got

21:37.729 --> 21:39.474
a back-channel call from Ml-6.

21:39.498 --> 21:42.610
They have a deep-cover mole
planted inside Jihad Al Hurriya.

21:42.634 --> 21:44.279
He made contact this morning.

21:44.303 --> 21:45.380
You confirm they're responsible?

21:45.404 --> 21:46.548
Just the opposite.

21:46.572 --> 21:48.283
Claim's bogus.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.951
Just somebody grabbing
media attention.

21:49.975 --> 21:51.920
Well, how reliable is the mole?

21:51.944 --> 21:53.254
What's his batting average?

21:53.278 --> 21:54.923
Led the league.
He's batting a thousand.

21:54.947 --> 21:56.291
Chatter indicates
that we've been looking

21:56.315 --> 21:57.992
in the wrong direction.

21:58.016 --> 21:59.761
This was not an attack
by terrorists.

21:59.785 --> 22:02.797
Do you have any other leads?

22:02.821 --> 22:04.254
No.

22:14.933 --> 22:17.378
Okay, so how many amendments
to the Constitution?

22:17.402 --> 22:20.281
Uh, Bill of Rights
is the first ten.

22:20.305 --> 22:21.849
Prohibition's 18.

22:21.873 --> 22:23.484
I'm guessing 23.

22:23.508 --> 22:25.520
- Twenty-seven.
- Nobody likes a smart-ass, David.

22:25.544 --> 22:27.989
Why do I have to study
all of this and you don't?

22:28.013 --> 22:29.139
I was born here.

22:32.250 --> 22:33.561
Hello, Mr. DiNozzo.

22:33.585 --> 22:36.998
Tony... please.

22:37.022 --> 22:38.766
Morning, Ziva.

22:38.790 --> 22:40.382
Good morning, Tony.

22:42.427 --> 22:44.005
Are you waiting for somebody?

22:44.029 --> 22:46.107
No. Uh...

22:46.131 --> 22:48.409
You've got Junior working
so hard,

22:48.433 --> 22:50.011
I was just killing some time

22:50.035 --> 22:53.171
people watching.

22:59.344 --> 23:01.622
Your hair looks great.

23:01.646 --> 23:04.513
Thank you.

23:06.685 --> 23:08.129
Oh, boy.

23:08.153 --> 23:09.764
Straighten your leg.

23:09.788 --> 23:11.466
There you go. Mm-hmm.

23:11.490 --> 23:12.700
Is that good?

23:12.724 --> 23:14.035
Very good.

23:14.059 --> 23:15.403
Feel the stretch
behind your knees.

23:15.427 --> 23:17.171
Sting does a lot of yoga,
and I like him.

23:17.195 --> 23:19.240
- Mm-hmm, keep breathing.
- DiNozzo.

23:19.264 --> 23:21.533
Boss.

23:24.970 --> 23:27.415
You know, it's not as bad
as it looks.

23:27.439 --> 23:30.318
It's actually an ancient
form of meditation.

23:30.342 --> 23:31.853
It's a good thing.

23:31.877 --> 23:33.777
Special Agent Gibbs,
you had breakfast?

23:35.013 --> 23:37.525
The party's over.

23:39.284 --> 23:40.862
Explain.

23:40.886 --> 23:42.230
Sayif had a date.

23:42.254 --> 23:45.099
He actually had a... he had a...
he had a couple of dates.

23:45.123 --> 23:47.268
And he wanted to go clubbing,
and I had to make

23:47.292 --> 23:49.404
the command decision
that we would go clubbing

23:49.428 --> 23:51.873
here in-in-in the
penthouse suite, and then

23:51.897 --> 23:54.409
Ashley the a.m. yoga instructor
arrived.

23:54.433 --> 23:57.011
And I guess things got
a little out of hand.

23:57.035 --> 23:58.279
This a good thing?

23:58.303 --> 23:59.680
Well, nobody got hurt.

23:59.704 --> 24:00.972
I got in a stretch.

24:04.142 --> 24:05.720
What's going on here?

24:05.744 --> 24:07.021
Relax, Abdalla.

24:07.045 --> 24:09.590
What, what?

24:09.614 --> 24:11.692
Father's plane landed
a half hour ago.

24:11.716 --> 24:14.028
He'll be here any minute.

24:14.052 --> 24:15.229
Ladies, out.

24:15.253 --> 24:16.998
- Time to leave.
- Okay.

24:17.022 --> 24:20.034
Get yourself dressed, Sayif.

24:20.058 --> 24:22.069
What were you thinking?

24:22.093 --> 24:24.772
Honestly, I didn't think
you'd be here for another hour.

24:24.796 --> 24:26.229
Time to get up.

24:29.501 --> 24:32.470
- These yours?
- Oh, yeah.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.466
I'll intercept Father
in the lobby.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.561
Has it been that long?

24:46.585 --> 24:47.562
Oh, at least.

24:47.586 --> 24:48.563
'96, I think.

24:48.587 --> 24:50.131
Son.

24:50.155 --> 24:52.600
Father.

24:52.624 --> 24:54.435
Well, uh...

24:54.459 --> 24:57.305
I have a little family matter

24:57.329 --> 25:00.274
to attend to, but, uh,
then we should talk.

25:00.298 --> 25:02.143
Where are you staying?

25:02.167 --> 25:04.412
Oh, right here in this hotel.

25:04.436 --> 25:07.633
Wonderful. Wonderful.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.818
Come, let's go.

25:10.842 --> 25:12.153
I told you to handle it.

25:12.177 --> 25:13.154
I spoke to him.

25:13.178 --> 25:14.789
I think he's losing his hearing.

25:14.813 --> 25:17.907
Give me a reason
not to bench you.

25:19.484 --> 25:22.419
I won't let him out of my sight.

25:28.827 --> 25:29.971
I've got something.

25:29.995 --> 25:31.138
So do I.

25:31.162 --> 25:32.273
What do you got?

25:32.297 --> 25:33.321
You show me yours first.

25:39.871 --> 25:42.583
Whoever made this bomb...
amateur.

25:42.607 --> 25:44.352
Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.020
Cheap components,
poorly constructed, and you want

25:46.044 --> 25:47.088
to know the weird thing?

25:47.112 --> 25:49.457
The timer didn't set it off.

25:49.481 --> 25:50.591
How's that?

25:50.615 --> 25:53.060
This bomb was supposed to go off

25:53.084 --> 25:54.996
30 minutes
after it actually did.

25:55.020 --> 25:56.531
Then what triggered it?

25:56.555 --> 25:57.732
I have a theory.

25:57.756 --> 25:58.933
None of the wires

25:58.957 --> 26:00.835
were properly insulated
or grounded.

26:00.859 --> 26:02.270
So anything
could have set it off,

26:02.294 --> 26:05.573
like a bump or a really,
really strong vibration.

26:05.597 --> 26:09.544
Witnesses saw a jet
flying low overhead.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.502
So show me yours.

26:14.439 --> 26:17.318
After Sayif's car left
the service station,

26:17.342 --> 26:19.820
it only went two places...
hotel garage

26:19.844 --> 26:22.423
where security cameras show
that no one approached it

26:22.447 --> 26:24.959
and Pax River the next morning.

26:24.983 --> 26:28.129
GPS shows that after Sayif
was dropped off at the hangar,

26:28.153 --> 26:30.698
the car drove to a remote part
of the base

26:30.722 --> 26:33.167
where there
are no security cameras.

26:33.191 --> 26:35.870
That's the only place the bomb
could have been planted.

26:35.894 --> 26:37.538
Hmm, so... where are you going?

26:37.562 --> 26:39.607
I got to check with Ducky
about something.

26:39.631 --> 26:42.577
Will you be accompanying
the body back to Riyadh?

26:42.601 --> 26:45.846
Yes. Walid died in the service
of my brother.

26:45.870 --> 26:49.083
Our families have been friends
for as long as I can remember.

26:49.107 --> 26:51.632
I'm gonna have to ask you
to wait right here.

27:06.825 --> 27:08.903
- What is it?
- Prince Abdalla,

27:08.927 --> 27:11.639
this is Dr. Mallard,
our medical examiner.

27:11.663 --> 27:15.743
I'm sorry, but I cannot
release the body just yet.

27:15.767 --> 27:17.311
I was told
Walid's body is ready.

27:17.335 --> 27:19.714
We have a royal jet standing by
at the airport.

27:19.738 --> 27:21.549
I apologize
for the inconvenience,

27:21.573 --> 27:23.651
but I have one more test
I must perform.

27:23.675 --> 27:27.042
I can assure you
there will be no desecration.

27:32.317 --> 27:33.594
This is unacceptable.

27:33.618 --> 27:36.553
Your state department
will hear from my embassy.

27:52.137 --> 27:55.783
Come on, Dad,
I got a lot of work to do.

27:55.807 --> 27:57.218
Almost done, Junior.

27:57.242 --> 27:59.654
You'll be happy to know that,
among other things,

27:59.678 --> 28:02.123
I've straightened out that
mix-up with your bank account.

28:02.147 --> 28:03.791
The funds will be available.

28:03.815 --> 28:06.784
Oh, that's great.

28:08.687 --> 28:11.349
Do you have to stick your nose
in everyone's business?

28:12.390 --> 28:14.085
Makes me a good investigator.

28:16.895 --> 28:18.939
DiNozzo.

28:18.963 --> 28:19.940
Give me that.

28:19.964 --> 28:21.809
It's for me.

28:21.833 --> 28:23.511
Elke?

28:23.535 --> 28:25.513
8:00.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.948
Perfect.

28:27.972 --> 28:29.950
- Yeah, I'm in suite 901.
- 901.

28:29.974 --> 28:31.352
Still have those magic fingers?

28:31.376 --> 28:32.586
You know I do.

28:32.610 --> 28:34.288
- Can't wait.
- Bye, bye.

28:34.312 --> 28:36.757
You gave a call girl
this number?

28:36.781 --> 28:39.960
Junior, that was the hotel spa.

28:39.984 --> 28:41.529
I'm a little tense.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.350
I need a massage.

28:44.756 --> 28:47.635
Oh, Gibbs, Ziva.

28:47.659 --> 28:50.805
- Sayif behaving?
- He is fine.

28:50.829 --> 28:52.873
Who's watching Prince Charming?

28:52.897 --> 28:54.208
He's in the air.

28:54.232 --> 28:55.743
His check ride.

28:55.767 --> 28:57.812
He cannot get in trouble
for the next three hours.

28:57.836 --> 29:00.448
Unless his instructor ejects
him at 20,000 feet.

29:00.472 --> 29:02.349
Well, you're busy
and I'm in the way here.

29:02.373 --> 29:04.652
I'm going to go
back to the hotel.

29:04.676 --> 29:06.353
Uh, you know what, I am going

29:06.377 --> 29:08.989
to make you an offer
you can't refuse.

29:09.013 --> 29:11.692
Very Special Probationary Agent
Ziva David is going to give you

29:11.716 --> 29:13.761
a personal, special tour
of NCIS headquarters.

29:13.785 --> 29:15.262
Come on.

29:15.286 --> 29:20.134
Well, that is a lovely offer,
but I'm sure Ziva must be busy.

29:20.158 --> 29:21.569
Yeah, she is.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.204
I'll show you around.

29:23.228 --> 29:24.205
Boss...

29:24.229 --> 29:26.129
We'll start with the armory.

29:27.432 --> 29:30.230
Back to work.

29:31.770 --> 29:34.014
I'm flashing back.

29:34.038 --> 29:35.816
Boarding school.

29:35.840 --> 29:38.365
Headmaster wants
to talk to my dad.

29:48.887 --> 29:49.997
Yeah, Tony.

29:50.021 --> 29:51.766
- Where are you?
- Autopsy.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.801
Emergency. Boss really needs you
up here right now.

29:53.825 --> 29:56.403
Get your skinny butt
on the move, pronto! Run!

29:56.427 --> 29:58.672
What do you want McGee to do?

29:58.696 --> 30:00.708
Use his computer magic.

30:00.732 --> 30:02.042
I need to find out

30:02.066 --> 30:04.159
what my father's been doing
on this thing.

30:05.703 --> 30:07.081
'Cause he's up to something.

30:07.105 --> 30:09.403
I can smell it.

30:15.613 --> 30:18.207
This doesn't look
like an armory to me.

30:21.019 --> 30:23.010
Sit.

30:24.322 --> 30:27.067
When you offered
to take me on the tour,

30:27.091 --> 30:29.403
I suspected you had
an ulterior motive.

30:29.427 --> 30:31.739
What's on your mind?

30:31.763 --> 30:33.607
Your son.

30:33.631 --> 30:37.795
What has, uh... Junior done now?

30:41.372 --> 30:44.552
Tony likes to hide
behind the face of a clown.

30:44.576 --> 30:48.889
But he's the best young agent
I've ever worked with.

30:48.913 --> 30:53.127
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

30:53.151 --> 30:55.729
When was the last time
you talked to him?

30:55.753 --> 30:58.532
I mean, really... talked to him?

30:58.556 --> 31:00.868
Well, we keep in touch.

31:00.892 --> 31:02.937
Four years ago,

31:02.961 --> 31:06.473
your son came very close
to dying from pneumonic plague.

31:06.497 --> 31:09.677
And I expected to see you.

31:09.701 --> 31:11.345
You didn't show then.

31:11.369 --> 31:13.514
Why are you here now?

31:13.538 --> 31:15.749
He never told me he was sick.

31:15.773 --> 31:19.153
Oh, so you don't keep in touch.

31:19.177 --> 31:21.088
What's your point?

31:21.112 --> 31:25.192
Tony inherited
his personality from you.

31:25.216 --> 31:29.697
But I get the feeling there's
a lot about your life

31:29.721 --> 31:31.018
you don't share.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.612
I should tell you to piss off.

31:44.636 --> 31:49.550
But I do know that Junior
thinks the world of you.

31:49.574 --> 31:52.509
So I'll keep this civil.

31:54.479 --> 31:56.913
You have children, Gibbs?

32:01.452 --> 32:03.731
Had.

32:03.755 --> 32:06.724
A daughter.

32:09.560 --> 32:11.255
But unfortunately...

32:13.498 --> 32:16.399
I didn't get the chance
to know her as an adult.

32:19.470 --> 32:22.132
You have that opportunity
to get to know Tony.

32:23.808 --> 32:25.986
Do it.

32:26.010 --> 32:29.207
Are we finished?

32:38.990 --> 32:40.301
Abby.

32:40.325 --> 32:41.835
You were right.

32:41.859 --> 32:43.938
The trace evidence that Ducky
swabbed from Walid's hands...

32:43.962 --> 32:46.607
it was unexploded particles
of nitromethane.

32:46.631 --> 32:47.942
The same explosive in the bomb.

32:47.966 --> 32:50.444
Walid planted the bomb
under Sayif's car.

32:50.468 --> 32:51.478
Nice work.

32:51.502 --> 32:53.580
You, too.

32:53.604 --> 32:57.351
So, Walid unintentionally
blew himself up

32:57.375 --> 32:58.919
when the vibrations from the jet

32:58.943 --> 33:00.421
triggered the explosion.

33:00.445 --> 33:02.256
And the victim was
his own killer.

33:02.280 --> 33:04.271
Hinky.

33:12.056 --> 33:15.669
What was Walid's motive
for planting the bomb?

33:15.693 --> 33:19.272
Well, as Sayif's aide,
he had plenty of opportunities

33:19.296 --> 33:20.974
to kill the prince
while they were alone.

33:20.998 --> 33:22.342
Maybe he was a suicide bomber

33:22.366 --> 33:24.277
and supposed to be
in the car with Sayif.

33:24.301 --> 33:26.313
Would look like a terrorist act.

33:26.337 --> 33:27.614
Hey, DiNozzo, are you with us?

33:27.638 --> 33:29.249
Yeah, boss.

33:29.273 --> 33:30.917
Whoever hires
the women around here

33:30.941 --> 33:31.918
deserves a bonus.

33:31.942 --> 33:32.919
They're not only beautiful,

33:32.943 --> 33:34.754
but they're bright.

33:34.778 --> 33:35.956
Oh, stop it.

33:35.980 --> 33:37.924
This the end of the tour?

33:37.948 --> 33:39.292
I think I've showed
him everything.

33:39.316 --> 33:41.995
Well, uh, not everything.

33:42.019 --> 33:44.364
Dad.

33:44.388 --> 33:46.099
Agent Grady is waiting
for you in Polygraph.

33:46.123 --> 33:48.201
She would like to give you
a demonstration.

33:48.225 --> 33:49.970
Oh, no one's wiring me up.

33:49.994 --> 33:52.806
But I would like to ask Abby
a few more questions.

33:52.830 --> 33:54.798
Well, come on, then.

34:02.406 --> 34:05.552
Okay. We've been treating
Walid like the victim.

34:05.576 --> 34:07.253
Let's start looking
at him as the murderer.

34:07.277 --> 34:08.621
Background him.

34:08.646 --> 34:10.724
Well, Sayif's the one that spent
the most time with him

34:10.748 --> 34:12.425
and was the targeted victim.

34:12.449 --> 34:13.793
He lands in 45 minutes.

34:13.817 --> 34:16.228
Go. Both of you, go talk to him.

34:16.253 --> 34:17.563
DiNozzo, get away
from that computer.

34:17.588 --> 34:18.679
We got to brief State.

34:20.056 --> 34:22.502
Have to break one
of your rules, boss.

34:22.525 --> 34:24.337
"Never say you're sorry."

34:24.360 --> 34:26.873
I let things get out of control
in the hotel room.

34:26.897 --> 34:28.041
Yeah, it's covered.

34:28.065 --> 34:30.176
- Rule 18.
- Oh, yeah.

34:30.199 --> 34:32.344
"It's better to seek forgiveness
than ask permission."

34:32.369 --> 34:33.679
Am I forgiven?

34:33.704 --> 34:35.215
No.

34:35.239 --> 34:37.730
You've been distracted
by your father.

34:39.309 --> 34:40.674
It's that obvious?

34:47.717 --> 34:49.728
He's not the man
I thought he was.

34:49.753 --> 34:51.014
I don't know my father.

34:52.822 --> 34:55.502
No, boss, my father's
always been a mystery to me.

34:55.525 --> 34:58.004
Just a wealthy one.

34:58.028 --> 34:59.739
It turns out he's broke.

34:59.763 --> 35:01.541
He has been for years.

35:01.565 --> 35:04.244
His bank accounts are overdrawn,
credit cards are frozen,

35:04.268 --> 35:05.378
property's foreclosed.

35:05.402 --> 35:07.113
The guy's tapped out.

35:07.137 --> 35:08.882
How'd you find that out?

35:08.906 --> 35:10.350
McGee got me into his records.

35:10.374 --> 35:13.219
But it turns out Senior's
been living high on the low

35:13.243 --> 35:14.754
for quite some time.

35:14.778 --> 35:17.508
I wonder if he was ever
as rich as he appeared.

35:19.583 --> 35:22.929
I think the reason
he came to town to see me

35:22.953 --> 35:27.400
was to confess the charade.

35:27.424 --> 35:30.403
But when he figured out
that Prince Omar was coming

35:30.427 --> 35:32.906
to town, I think he, uh...

35:32.930 --> 35:35.275
he saw the chance
for one last score.

35:35.299 --> 35:38.278
His whole life's one big con.

35:38.302 --> 35:41.567
What are you going
to do about it?

35:44.508 --> 35:45.719
End the game.

35:45.743 --> 35:47.620
When?

35:47.644 --> 35:50.824
Time to do it's when he checks
out of the hotel.

35:50.848 --> 35:52.726
He's staying
in a $1,000-a-night suite.

35:52.750 --> 35:54.027
He can't afford it.

35:54.051 --> 35:56.129
He's running up a huge tab.

35:56.153 --> 35:59.232
I'll get him when he tries
to pay the bill.

35:59.256 --> 36:02.469
What can you tell me, Gibbs?

36:02.493 --> 36:04.188
Well, we know
who planted the bomb.

36:05.162 --> 36:08.975
Oh, my protection detail.

36:08.999 --> 36:11.678
Miss me?

36:11.702 --> 36:13.947
We need to ask you
a few questions about Walid.

36:13.971 --> 36:16.249
Aren't you going to ask
if I passed my check ride?

36:16.273 --> 36:17.417
Did you?

36:17.441 --> 36:19.619
With flying colors.

36:19.643 --> 36:20.987
Good. Now you can go home.

36:21.011 --> 36:22.655
Aw.

36:22.679 --> 36:26.059
Hey. How long have you
and Walid been friends?

36:26.083 --> 36:28.061
He was not my friend.

36:28.085 --> 36:29.729
He was assigned to me
by the embassy.

36:29.753 --> 36:30.997
My brother, to be exact.

36:31.021 --> 36:33.266
- Were they close?
- Since they were kids.

36:33.290 --> 36:37.170
The two of them shared
religious and political beliefs.

36:37.194 --> 36:39.038
Your lifestyle has to be
an embarrassment to them.

36:39.062 --> 36:40.340
I think Walid's

36:40.364 --> 36:42.842
real job was to keep
an eye on me for my brother.

36:42.866 --> 36:44.766
He would do anything
Abdalla asked him to do.

36:47.037 --> 36:48.081
What?

36:48.105 --> 36:51.074
Walid planted the explosive
under your car.

36:54.011 --> 36:55.171
Gibbs.

37:06.456 --> 37:08.034
Agent Gibbs...

37:08.058 --> 37:10.970
what is it I can do for you?

37:10.994 --> 37:11.971
You leaving?

37:11.995 --> 37:13.706
Shortly.

37:13.730 --> 37:15.375
You just arrived.

37:15.399 --> 37:16.643
Pressing family matters.

37:16.667 --> 37:18.444
We think your son's driver Walid

37:18.468 --> 37:20.113
planted the bomb.

37:20.137 --> 37:22.348
If Prince Abdalla's here,
we'd like to speak with him.

37:22.372 --> 37:25.218
Sayif called
and told me everything.

37:25.242 --> 37:26.953
If you came here to ask Abdalla

37:26.977 --> 37:29.389
if Walid was following
his orders,

37:29.413 --> 37:31.224
the answer is yes.

37:31.248 --> 37:33.193
He admitted it?

37:33.217 --> 37:35.361
Unfortunately, he did.

37:35.385 --> 37:37.864
And why would he do that?

37:37.888 --> 37:40.533
He told me he felt
his brother's lifestyle

37:40.557 --> 37:42.068
would bring shame to our family.

37:42.092 --> 37:45.405
He thought it better
if Sayif die as a martyr.

37:45.429 --> 37:49.242
I'm sorry what he did
took place on your soil.

37:49.266 --> 37:51.211
Where is Prince Abdalla?

37:51.235 --> 37:54.314
At the airport,
aboard a royal jet.

37:54.338 --> 37:56.816
Well, he's going to have
to answer for what he's done.

37:56.840 --> 37:59.118
As a member of the embassy's
administrative staff,

37:59.142 --> 38:01.321
Abdalla has diplomatic immunity.

38:01.345 --> 38:04.490
His safe passage is ensured.

38:04.514 --> 38:05.874
You're gonna let him
just get away?

38:08.018 --> 38:10.864
He still is my son, Agent Gibbs.

38:10.888 --> 38:13.600
Fathers do what they have
to do for their children.

38:13.624 --> 38:16.002
This is my problem.

38:16.026 --> 38:19.505
He will be dealt with
most severely, I assure you.

38:19.529 --> 38:21.174
Now, if you'll excuse me.

38:22.900 --> 38:25.411
Agent DiNozzo...

38:25.435 --> 38:28.047
would you please tell
your father I regret

38:28.071 --> 38:29.682
not having more time
to spend with him?

38:29.706 --> 38:33.052
Let him know I'll be
in Monte Carlo next month.

38:33.076 --> 38:35.010
Maybe we can see
each other there.

38:41.885 --> 38:44.697
Prince Omar said
you could catch up with him

38:44.721 --> 38:47.349
in Monte Carlo next month.

38:48.358 --> 38:50.770
He left?

38:50.794 --> 38:52.105
He-He just landed

38:52.129 --> 38:53.806
this morning.

38:53.830 --> 38:57.043
Well, yeah...
he's got a lot on his mind, Dad.

38:57.067 --> 38:58.478
Cut him some slack.

38:58.502 --> 39:01.514
Well, you have work
to do, Junior.

39:01.538 --> 39:03.449
- I can check myself out.
- Oh, no.

39:03.473 --> 39:05.051
I've got time.

39:05.075 --> 39:07.420
I'll even drive you
to the station.

39:07.444 --> 39:08.988
What do you think about that?

39:09.012 --> 39:10.847
Already called for a cab.

39:14.584 --> 39:15.728
Hi...

39:15.752 --> 39:17.330
Taylor.

39:17.354 --> 39:18.631
How may I help you?

39:18.655 --> 39:19.766
Uh, I'm checking out.

39:19.790 --> 39:21.935
DiNozzo, suite 901.

39:21.959 --> 39:24.570
Would you like me to leave that
on your credit card?

39:24.594 --> 39:26.994
Actually, um...

39:28.298 --> 39:29.842
I need to talk
to you about that.

39:29.866 --> 39:32.946
I'll take care of Mr. DiNozzo.

39:32.970 --> 39:36.182
Uh, that's all right.
I'm sure that, uh...

39:36.206 --> 39:37.366
Taylor can handle this.

39:41.345 --> 39:43.122
Um...

39:43.146 --> 39:44.991
Bruce, uh...

39:45.015 --> 39:46.326
I'm experiencing some problems

39:46.350 --> 39:47.860
with my credit card.

39:54.458 --> 39:57.170
I don't think we'll be
needing it, Mr. DiNozzo.

39:57.194 --> 39:59.372
Your bill has been paid in full.

39:59.396 --> 40:01.207
I'll get you a copy
for your records.

40:01.231 --> 40:04.826
Oh, and also, something
has been left here for you.

40:08.739 --> 40:10.707
What is it?

40:13.944 --> 40:16.556
A note from, uh, Prince Omar...

40:16.580 --> 40:18.324
Al...

40:18.348 --> 40:21.828
and a, uh, confirmation number

40:21.852 --> 40:24.330
for an open-ended

40:24.354 --> 40:27.551
first-class flight
to Monte Carlo.

40:29.159 --> 40:30.870
I guess he...

40:30.894 --> 40:33.130
felt guilty
about standing me up.

40:34.664 --> 40:37.360
You lead a charmed life,
don't you?

40:39.202 --> 40:41.067
It was great seeing you, Junior.

40:42.773 --> 40:44.570
I enjoyed our talk.

40:46.009 --> 40:48.855
We should do that more often.

40:48.879 --> 40:51.040
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

40:52.582 --> 40:53.981
I mean it.

40:56.787 --> 40:59.356
I...

41:08.465 --> 41:11.195
I love you, Anthony.

41:15.372 --> 41:16.862
I love you.

41:35.459 --> 41:36.636
Hey. Steak, cowboy-style.

41:36.660 --> 41:37.888
I love it.

41:41.364 --> 41:42.542
Your father leave?

41:42.566 --> 41:44.310
Yeah.

41:44.334 --> 41:46.359
Should be in New York by now.

41:56.012 --> 41:58.624
So, how'd it go?

41:58.648 --> 42:01.294
He skated again. Guy's amazing.

42:01.318 --> 42:04.597
So, what happened?

42:04.621 --> 42:06.899
Ah, his buddy Omar

42:06.923 --> 42:11.758
picked up the tab, bought him an
airline ticket to Monte Carlo.

42:16.032 --> 42:18.945
Where'd you get the money, Tony?

42:18.969 --> 42:20.561
What?

42:26.543 --> 42:27.954
How do you do it?

42:27.978 --> 42:29.789
Well...

42:29.813 --> 42:32.992
I didn't really need
to go on a cruise

42:33.016 --> 42:36.596
with my fraternity brothers,
did I?

42:36.620 --> 42:38.611
Getting a little old
for that stuff.

42:39.723 --> 42:42.535
Eh, you conned the con man.

42:42.559 --> 42:43.894
Runs in the family.

42:47.264 --> 42:49.255
Why'd you do it?

42:50.867 --> 42:53.846
He's my father.

42:53.870 --> 42:56.449
He is who he is.

42:56.473 --> 42:59.318
I couldn't bust him.

42:59.342 --> 43:03.403
Sometimes it's better to keep
what you know to yourself.

43:07.284 --> 43:10.082
Amen.
