the real world, George.

42:12.263 --> 42:13.999
You're a simulation.

42:16.134 --> 42:19.671
You're never
coming back, right?

42:19.705 --> 42:21.907
Even you admit that
once you press that button,

42:21.940 --> 42:23.642
you're never coming back.

42:23.675 --> 42:25.711
You're damn right.
Before you do something

42:25.744 --> 42:27.045
we know will be permanent,

42:27.078 --> 42:28.680
you need to hear me out
one last time,

42:28.714 --> 42:29.848
for old time's sake.

42:36.187 --> 42:37.889
You and me...

42:44.663 --> 42:46.632
We've got history
in this world.

42:48.667 --> 42:50.936
We were having an affair
when Katie disappeared.

42:53.404 --> 42:55.907
We were gonna end it,
we kept telling each other.

42:55.941 --> 42:57.208
I think we
might have meant it.

42:57.242 --> 43:00.078
You loved your wife...

43:00.111 --> 43:02.147
and I didn't want to be
the other woman.

43:02.180 --> 43:04.883
But before we had a chance
to act on that one

43:04.916 --> 43:07.018
small bit of moral courage,

43:07.052 --> 43:09.220
she vanished.

43:09.254 --> 43:11.990
Colin,
or whatever his name is,

43:12.023 --> 43:15.126
he wanted the software
you developed for the NSA.

43:15.160 --> 43:17.295
Software...

43:17.328 --> 43:21.232
The most powerful software
decryption ever developed.

43:21.266 --> 43:24.335
And Colin knew if he got it,
he could do almost anything.

43:24.369 --> 43:27.038
Hack the entire
U.S. intelligence community

43:27.072 --> 43:30.275
maybe even get his hands on
the U.S. nuclear launch codes.

43:30.308 --> 43:33.244
You understood the stakes,
so you wouldn't let him have it.

43:33.278 --> 43:35.280
You offered him billions
to let Katie go.

43:37.883 --> 43:39.150
But he didn't want money.

43:39.184 --> 43:41.519
He wanted to show you
he couldn't be bought.

43:45.390 --> 43:48.159
That's when you started
developing the headset.

43:48.193 --> 43:50.095
No, no, no.
That's when you started talking

43:50.128 --> 43:51.329
about needing a vacation.

43:51.362 --> 43:53.298
No, no, no.
This isn't real.

43:53.331 --> 43:55.967
This isn't real. You're a fan--
Think about this for a moment

43:56.001 --> 43:57.335
Really think.
You're a fantasy.

43:57.368 --> 43:58.837
One of these worlds
is a fantasy

43:58.870 --> 44:00.038
drawn from your own mind.

44:00.071 --> 44:01.272
Which is more likely,
George?

44:01.306 --> 44:03.809
A fantasy where
you're heartbroken

44:03.842 --> 44:05.811
because your wife
has been brutally murdered,

44:05.844 --> 44:07.713
or a fantasy
where you're happy

44:07.746 --> 44:08.914
and everything is perfect

44:08.947 --> 44:10.782
because your wife
is still alive?

44:15.286 --> 44:19.324
[INHALES SHARPLY]
That's not-- This isn't right.

44:19.357 --> 44:21.026
This isn't real.

44:22.894 --> 44:24.796
Okay, fine.
It's your choice.

44:24.830 --> 44:27.866
I'm not gonna stop you.

44:27.899 --> 44:29.400
You put that thing on,

44:29.434 --> 44:31.269
and you could end up
in a permanent coma.

44:31.302 --> 44:33.404
Hey, at least
you'll be having

44:33.438 --> 44:36.107
hot lesbian sex
in some sci-fi paradise.

44:37.308 --> 44:38.844
Or you can
stay here with me,

44:38.877 --> 44:40.912
and we face the pain
and the horror of this

44:40.946 --> 44:42.748
in the real world
together.

44:47.018 --> 44:49.454
No, I'm not really
selling this, I know.

44:49.487 --> 44:51.456
I think that's why
I went into medicine

44:51.489 --> 44:52.824
and not marketing.

45:11.877 --> 45:14.512
I don't...

45:14.545 --> 45:16.247
deserve that life.

45:18.149 --> 45:19.851
[VOICE CRACKS]
I never did.

45:19.885 --> 45:22.053
Neither of us do.

45:25.190 --> 45:27.893
This is what we deserve,
to live here.

45:30.328 --> 45:33.064
Punishment for our sins.

45:56.354 --> 45:59.290
[HEART MONITOR BEEPING]
KATIE: Sarah!

45:59.324 --> 46:01.359
Sarah?

46:01.392 --> 46:03.995
Sarah?

46:04.029 --> 46:05.163
Sarah?

46:06.364 --> 46:08.366
Sarah,
I'm right here, baby.

46:08.399 --> 46:11.903
I am right here, so you
come back to me, okay?

46:11.937 --> 46:14.039
Sarah, I'm right here.

46:16.041 --> 46:17.275
I'm right here, baby,

46:17.308 --> 46:18.944
don't you dare
fucking leave me here.

46:18.977 --> 46:22.380
Her neuronal pathways
have shut down.

46:22.413 --> 46:24.515
I'm sorry,
there's nothing we can do.

46:37.362 --> 46:39.330
Why would she choose
that life?

46:41.299 --> 46:43.034
KATIE:
She wanted to be punished.

46:47.205 --> 46:48.406
For her sins...

46:50.208 --> 46:52.043
Real and imagined

46:53.344 --> 46:54.545
Surviving.

46:57.582 --> 46:59.951
Being happy.

46:59.985 --> 47:02.187
MARIO:
Being happy is not a sin.

47:02.220 --> 47:03.454
KATIE:
We're all sinners.

47:05.523 --> 47:07.525
And we all think we need
to be punished.

47:08.994 --> 47:10.495
Even if our sins
don't exist.
