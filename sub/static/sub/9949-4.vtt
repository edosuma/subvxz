Anyone watching,

00:03.730 --> 00:06.899
thinking we know fuck all about
knowing fuck all about owt

00:06.900 --> 00:08.869
needs to watch their backs.

00:08.870 --> 00:12.299
So, you've had your Labour
reclassifying skunk,

00:12.300 --> 00:14.239
sending prices sky high.

00:14.240 --> 00:15.709
Literally.

00:15.710 --> 00:18.659
Literally taking the grass
from its own roots.

00:18.660 --> 00:20.869
Now you've got your ConDemNation,

00:20.870 --> 00:24.519
Liberals noshing Tories
like altar boys picking dimps up.

00:24.520 --> 00:27.949
Have we have
a national fucking stroke, or what?

00:27.950 --> 00:30.879
Is revolution a word...

00:30.880 --> 00:32.359
or was it never?

00:32.360 --> 00:34.549
Anybody watching needs to know,

00:34.550 --> 00:37.979
we cope better than average
with irony in Chatsworth.

00:37.980 --> 00:41.169
Well, for fuck's sake, we live
in Manchester.

00:41.170 --> 00:44.099
And they charge us for water.

00:44.100 --> 00:46.309
I wandered lonely as a cloud,

00:46.310 --> 00:48.759
necking mushrooms rarely found.

00:48.760 --> 00:51.919
Green and pleasant land
and ancient times...

00:51.920 --> 00:55.119
Yak, yak, yak, yak, yak!

00:55.120 --> 00:58.279
It's not theirs any more.

00:58.280 --> 01:00.729
This is our England now.

01:00.730 --> 01:02.939
Party!

Fuck are you doing here?

02:08.990 --> 02:11.440
I live here.
What the fuck are you doing here?

02:17.320 --> 02:18.300
What happened?

02:18.301 --> 02:20.989
You didn't fancy walking home.

02:20.990 --> 02:24.659
Kettle on, eh? And see to Cilla
for us, I'm shattered.

02:24.660 --> 02:26.600
That's cos you've been guzzling
drink half the night.

02:26.601 --> 02:28.809
Which you never do!

02:28.810 --> 02:30.780
I don't even remember
leaving the pub.

02:30.781 --> 02:33.469
Oh, fuck it! You were on
good form, we all were.

02:33.470 --> 02:35.919
That's how we carried
it on back here...

02:35.920 --> 02:36.640
We?

02:36.641 --> 02:38.360
Karen came. Slept in with Ruby.

02:39.590 --> 02:40.810
It was a good night!

02:40.811 --> 02:42.039
Kettle's on.

02:42.040 --> 02:43.979
Hey! Don't do half a job.

02:43.980 --> 02:46.430
Get us a fucking cuppa!

02:49.380 --> 02:51.319
Look at the state of this, eh?

02:51.320 --> 02:53.288
Thought girls were supposed
to be tidy,

02:53.289 --> 02:54.760
not getting all drunk and messy.

02:54.761 --> 02:57.199
You're not going to be like that,
are you?

02:57.200 --> 02:58.430
You're a good girl.

03:15.060 --> 03:17.749
As long as you keep betting,
I'll keep taking your money.

03:17.750 --> 03:19.210
End of the week.

03:19.960 --> 03:21.179
Got a job.

03:21.180 --> 03:22.158
I'm busy.

03:22.159 --> 03:22.880
Can't it wait?

03:22.881 --> 03:25.089
If I wanted it to.

03:25.090 --> 03:26.319
But I don't.

03:26.320 --> 03:29.749
Why don't you ask these two?
He's a gangster's apprentice,

03:29.750 --> 03:31.688
and I happen to know
he needs a bit of cash

03:31.689 --> 03:32.920
to pay off his gambling debt.

03:34.880 --> 03:35.840
You up to it?

03:35.841 --> 03:37.809
Course, it's about time!

03:37.810 --> 03:39.279
What's in it for me?

03:39.280 --> 03:41.719
How much do you owe Shane?

03:41.720 --> 03:42.710
40 quid.

03:42.711 --> 03:44.649
Then let's call it 45.

03:44.650 --> 03:46.140
Clear your gambling debts,

03:46.141 --> 03:49.309
still enough left over for
a bag of sherbet lemons.

03:49.310 --> 03:51.999
Money. Address.
Don't come back empty handed, eh?

03:52.000 --> 03:53.459
I won't.

03:53.460 --> 03:54.949
Take the Merc.

03:54.950 --> 03:58.120
He doesn't drive if you want
to keep your testicles.

04:04.240 --> 04:04.980
I need a word.

04:04.981 --> 04:06.439
Platypus.

04:06.440 --> 04:07.669
Plat...?

04:07.670 --> 04:09.129
Duck. Part otter.

04:09.130 --> 04:12.559
I know what it is.
The only egg-laying mammal.

04:12.560 --> 04:13.520
It's a word.

04:16.959 --> 04:18.418
So, is it positive or not?

04:18.418 --> 04:19.637
I can't tell, cos its smashed.

04:19.639 --> 04:20.390
And who was...?

04:20.391 --> 04:21.850
Your mam, Karen, Gloria.

04:27.730 --> 04:30.659
It's totally irresponsible
if one of them is up the duff.

04:30.660 --> 04:33.349
So are you and my mam trying
for another one?

04:33.350 --> 04:36.779
Well, it depends what you mean
by trying.

04:36.780 --> 04:40.209
I mean, are you fucking my mother
with the intention of getting
her pregnant?

04:40.210 --> 04:42.659
I've been double bagging lately.

04:42.660 --> 04:44.600
Cos we've been doing
a lot of back door first.

04:44.601 --> 04:47.529
Most of the time, she just
finishes me off with a blowy.

04:47.530 --> 04:49.020
She does swallow, though, so...

04:49.021 --> 04:51.709
Cos swallowing's
a big pregnancy risk, is it?

04:51.710 --> 04:53.650
Oh, yeah. Shit.
It could be Karen.

04:55.380 --> 04:57.320
I can't believe your mam
wouldn't tell me.

04:57.321 --> 04:59.049
Hey!

04:59.050 --> 05:00.520
Bit of luck, might be Gloria's.

05:04.670 --> 05:07.599
"In the beginning was the Word.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.559
"The Word was with God.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.269
"The Word was God.

05:11.270 --> 05:13.719
"The same was in the beginning
with God.

05:13.720 --> 05:16.159
"All things were made through Him...

05:16.160 --> 05:19.360
"..but without Him
was not anything made..."

05:35.240 --> 05:37.690
"There was a man sent from God
whose name was John..."

05:52.140 --> 05:53.840
I'll ask her to give you a call
and rearrange, if that's OK?

05:53.841 --> 05:55.069
All right.

05:55.070 --> 05:56.288
I'm sorry about that.
It's all right. OK.

05:56.289 --> 05:56.768
Ta-ra now.

05:56.769 --> 05:57.760
See you.

06:02.890 --> 06:04.379
How many more?

06:04.380 --> 06:06.320
Another two, maybe.

06:09.520 --> 06:11.220
I just can't face her today.

06:12.200 --> 06:15.370
If there was anything wrong,
you would tell me, wouldn't you?

06:16.840 --> 06:17.820
I'm just hungover.

06:17.821 --> 06:20.029
This seems fine.

06:20.030 --> 06:22.239
Not as good as your own,
but it'll do for a bit.

06:22.240 --> 06:23.199
Here.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.909
What happened to my own phone?

06:25.910 --> 06:28.089
It's in the bin,
stinking of cheap lager.

06:28.090 --> 06:30.060
You dropped it in
a pint pot last night.

06:36.180 --> 06:38.120
I really need to fucking behave.

06:39.110 --> 06:41.559
Popular.

06:41.560 --> 06:44.000
Or unpopular.

06:50.360 --> 06:53.049
For fuck's sake.

06:53.050 --> 06:55.020
You're sure you got
the right address?

06:55.021 --> 06:57.469
Its not an address, it's a location.

06:57.470 --> 06:59.409
The Sat Nav says I have.

06:59.410 --> 07:00.400
Maybe we should just...

07:00.401 --> 07:02.099
The paper says wait.

07:02.100 --> 07:04.548
It's freaking me out, this shit,
man. It could be a set-up.

07:04.549 --> 07:06.758
They could have guns.
We could wake up in a ditch,

07:06.759 --> 07:08.220
bullets in the back of our heads.

07:08.221 --> 07:10.669
Nah, it's a few steaks
for a meat raffle.

07:10.670 --> 07:13.860
If it's a few steaks, why have you
got an envelope filled with notes?

07:15.080 --> 07:16.790
He's got a gun!

07:22.670 --> 07:23.650
This is private land.

07:23.651 --> 07:25.600
Jamie Maguire sent us.

07:35.150 --> 07:36.850
Come.

07:54.470 --> 07:57.899
I'm not quite sure this is
what Jamie had in mind.

07:57.900 --> 07:59.599
It's 300lb of quality beef.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.070
But it's still whole!

08:07.430 --> 08:09.400
Not for long.

08:24.080 --> 08:26.769
Traded Jackson in for
a younger model?

08:26.770 --> 08:28.719
Can recommend it if you have.

08:28.720 --> 08:29.940
He's just a mate from work.

08:29.941 --> 08:31.909
Is he the one that...?

08:31.910 --> 08:35.078
Uppers to keep himself working,
downers to get some sleep.

08:35.080 --> 08:37.279
He's sorted himself out now, though.

08:37.280 --> 08:39.248
I wouldn't kick him out of bed
for dropping crumbs.

08:39.249 --> 08:40.720
You two getting on, then?

08:40.721 --> 08:41.938
Behave!

08:41.940 --> 08:43.639
He's just a laugh, that's all.

08:43.640 --> 08:45.850
I'm just going to...

08:47.560 --> 08:49.019
Right. First of all,

08:49.020 --> 08:51.729
we've all popped a few pills in
our time, so don't judge me.

08:51.730 --> 08:54.659
Secondly, if you were 20 years
younger, I'd have you, crumbs or not.

08:54.660 --> 08:58.330
And as for Mrs Robinson, well!
The night is still young.

09:00.280 --> 09:01.780
Looks like he's hung. Is he hung?

09:04.450 --> 09:06.639
Can I have a beer?

09:06.640 --> 09:09.080
Thought we might have a quiet night
in, just the two of us.

09:09.081 --> 09:10.309
Why?

09:10.310 --> 09:13.000
We'll get an Indian, curl up,
watch something.

09:13.980 --> 09:15.710
Have you got something you
want to tell me?

09:15.711 --> 09:18.400
That I want to get a take-out
and watch a film.

09:28.430 --> 09:29.649
Are you...?

09:29.650 --> 09:31.359
What?

09:31.360 --> 09:33.319
Putting on a bit of weight?

09:33.320 --> 09:36.009
Why would you ask any woman
a question like that?

09:36.010 --> 09:36.970
I'm just saying.

09:36.971 --> 09:39.419
Well, that's like me just saying,

09:39.420 --> 09:41.629
"Not to worry,
size really doesn't matter."

09:41.630 --> 09:45.779
I wasn't having a go,
I just thought, maybe you'd...

09:45.780 --> 09:47.270
skipped a period, that's all.

09:47.271 --> 09:51.419
No. I had my period last week.

09:51.420 --> 09:53.389
Remember?

09:53.390 --> 09:55.809
You did that thing.

09:55.810 --> 09:58.259
Oh! Of course.

09:58.260 --> 10:00.969
Just after you did that other thing.

10:00.970 --> 10:02.440
Yes.

10:05.600 --> 10:06.830
Can't eat that now, can I?

10:08.290 --> 10:10.020
Size isn't really an issue, is it?

10:14.650 --> 10:15.160
Hiya, love!

10:15.161 --> 10:16.619
Any sign of your Shane?

10:16.620 --> 10:19.309
He was in this morning.
Tried his moby?

10:19.310 --> 10:22.499
Straight to voice-mail.
Never showed today.

10:22.500 --> 10:23.960
Don't bring me in here...

10:23.961 --> 10:26.889
Thought she was on an early?
Been here since she finished?

10:26.890 --> 10:29.339
Been cackling all afternoon.

10:29.340 --> 10:31.549
Do you know him?

10:31.550 --> 10:33.489
A mate from her work. Nice kid.

10:33.490 --> 10:36.919
More man than boy.

10:36.920 --> 10:39.130
Behave!

10:44.750 --> 10:46.240
Feeling rough?

10:48.180 --> 10:50.629
Come in. Please,
make yourself at home.

10:50.630 --> 10:52.839
Is it mine?

10:52.840 --> 10:54.780
How could you be so stupid?

10:57.470 --> 11:00.659
For fuck's sake! I need to know
what you're going to do.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.110
Do you have any
idea what this could do to Karen?

11:05.320 --> 11:08.239
Well, the last thing
on my mind right now is...

11:08.240 --> 11:10.929
how your wife may or may not react

11:10.930 --> 11:13.620
to what I might have to tell her.

11:20.240 --> 11:21.469
Please.

11:21.470 --> 11:22.670
I need to know.

11:51.560 --> 11:56.000
Gloria, your phone. Either
answer it or change the ring tone.

11:56.090 --> 11:57.660
It's been doing my head in all day.

11:57.661 --> 11:59.860
I'm busy.

12:01.570 --> 12:03.510
Persistent, aren't they?
Is it a fella?

12:03.511 --> 12:04.499
I wish.

12:04.500 --> 12:06.939
Just tell me, is everything OK?

12:06.940 --> 12:11.100
Will you stop asking me that?!
It's getting on my nerves.

12:13.540 --> 12:16.500
Yeah? Hang on a minute. She's here.

12:26.020 --> 12:28.979
Jack and The Beanstalk,
is it, this year?

12:28.980 --> 12:31.420
My favourite panto.
I don't know how you do it, though.

12:31.421 --> 12:33.609
It'd play havoc with my back.

12:33.610 --> 12:34.590
What are you on about?

12:34.591 --> 12:38.259
The back end. Bent double,
eight shows a week.

12:38.260 --> 12:41.699
Who decides who's
up front and behind?

12:41.700 --> 12:43.400
Certainly lifelike.

12:45.370 --> 12:47.820
Pace yourself, you've started early.

12:54.660 --> 12:58.090
I took out a loan.
About nine weeks ago.

12:59.070 --> 13:01.759
But you've got about
five credit cards already.

13:01.760 --> 13:04.210
Which is why I needed a loan.

13:07.880 --> 13:13.019
It was all legit, up front. Applied
online. Pay-day loan company.

13:13.020 --> 13:14.479
How much did you borrow?

13:14.480 --> 13:15.699
1,200.

13:15.700 --> 13:18.389
I thought these companies
are supposed to limit

13:18.390 --> 13:19.859
how much you can have.

13:19.860 --> 13:24.269
Not my first time. Used my
credit cards to make the payments.

13:24.270 --> 13:28.420
If you ever did any tidying,
you'd have noticed this.

13:35.770 --> 13:37.470
I've kind of run out of options.

13:39.440 --> 13:42.849
Jesus, Gloria! 4,300% APR!

13:42.850 --> 13:44.578
Yeah, but you can't
count it like that.

13:44.579 --> 13:45.800
If you pay it back
when you're supposed to...

13:45.801 --> 13:47.979
Have you paid anything back?

13:47.980 --> 13:50.939
And it's them that are
constantly calling you?

13:50.940 --> 13:52.400
40 missed calls yesterday.

13:52.401 --> 13:55.330
You borrowed 1,200 quid nine weeks
ago, how much do you owe now?

13:57.060 --> 13:58.760
Five grand.

14:00.970 --> 14:02.430
And counting.

14:10.260 --> 14:11.719
What's that?

14:11.720 --> 14:12.699
A cow.

14:12.700 --> 14:15.389
Feel free to elaborate.

14:15.390 --> 14:19.569
We'll get it shifted as soon as
we've got somewhere to shift it to.

14:19.570 --> 14:21.509
Its name's Alan.

14:21.510 --> 14:22.499
Alan.

14:22.500 --> 14:23.959
Alan the Cow?

14:23.960 --> 14:26.649
You do know cows are girls?

14:26.650 --> 14:28.110
Tell me about it.

14:29.600 --> 14:30.820
Jamie sent us to get it.

14:30.821 --> 14:32.769
Is this for the meat raffle?

14:32.770 --> 14:33.989
Shhhh!

14:33.990 --> 14:36.199
It's not as if she can
understand me, is it?

14:36.200 --> 14:38.409
Animals can sense things.

14:38.410 --> 14:40.589
Yeah, dogs know when
earthquakes are coming.

14:40.590 --> 14:43.040
So, Alan was supposed to be...

14:48.180 --> 14:50.140
Couldn't do it. Look at her eyes.

14:51.370 --> 14:55.279
Alan's grown on us.
Cracking little personality.

14:55.280 --> 14:56.979
No wonder you couldn't kill her,

14:56.980 --> 14:58.950
you should never give
your dinner a name.

14:58.951 --> 15:00.659
Can you keep quiet about it?

15:00.660 --> 15:03.099
As long as you can
do the same with her.

15:03.100 --> 15:05.789
I don't want waking up
in the wee small hours,

15:05.790 --> 15:07.520
when she's mooing to be milked.

15:08.980 --> 15:11.909
Look at her udders!
They're near exploding already.

15:11.910 --> 15:15.100
ALAN MOOS

15:16.810 --> 15:18.509
Fuck!

15:18.510 --> 15:19.738
You're doing it.

15:19.739 --> 15:20.478
No, you're doing it!

15:20.479 --> 15:21.700
No, you're doing it!

15:22.930 --> 15:24.389
Should've just told me.

15:24.390 --> 15:27.819
We could ask them to freeze it,
give you a chance to catch up?

15:27.820 --> 15:30.268
They say that. Worst thing
you can do is ignore it.

15:30.269 --> 15:32.478
That might be what they say
when Anne Robinson phones.

15:32.479 --> 15:34.420
But reality's
a little bit different.

15:37.350 --> 15:41.529
How the fuck am I going
to raise £5,000, Dom?

15:41.530 --> 15:42.750
How long have you got?

15:42.751 --> 15:45.200
Two days.

15:46.900 --> 15:49.349
Why did you leave it
to the last minute?

15:49.350 --> 15:51.559
Because if I told you, you'd say,

15:51.560 --> 15:53.739
"Why did you leave it
to the last minute?"

15:53.740 --> 15:57.179
All right, I'll put the feelers out,

15:57.180 --> 15:59.860
see if I can call in some favours.

16:01.330 --> 16:02.550
Five grand's worth?

16:05.500 --> 16:08.670
I'm still a priest.
I have the power of Guilt.

16:35.340 --> 16:38.769
Shane would know.
Just tug it a bit harder.

16:38.770 --> 16:40.230
I don't want to hurt her,
and I'm scared of pulling it off.

16:40.231 --> 16:42.439
Try a different hand action.

16:42.440 --> 16:43.420
You try a different
fuckin' hand action!

16:43.421 --> 16:45.129
I can't touch it, I'm a Muslim.

16:45.130 --> 16:46.590
It's Hindus with cows.

16:47.820 --> 16:49.040
Can't you... like...?

16:50.770 --> 16:52.709
I'm not wanking a cow off!

16:52.710 --> 16:53.940
It's tits, not a cock!

16:53.941 --> 16:58.350
Listen, she's called Alan, I am not
wanking off anyone called Alan!

17:06.660 --> 17:07.880
Doesn't bother you?

17:07.881 --> 17:09.368
No. Why would it?

17:09.369 --> 17:10.568
Power to your elbow.

17:10.569 --> 17:12.540
Can I have a glass
of water please, babes?

17:12.540 --> 17:16.949
I was just saying to your fella,
a lot of men would be intimidated.

17:16.950 --> 17:20.118
She's always been a total
fag-hag. Doesn't bother me.

17:20.119 --> 17:21.819
What's that got to do with anything?

17:21.820 --> 17:24.029
I don't mind the gays.
I'm cool with it.

17:24.030 --> 17:27.459
Two points. Firstly, you better
be all right with "the gays."

17:27.460 --> 17:29.669
Secondly, Calum's not one of them.

17:29.670 --> 17:30.899
Yes, he is.

17:30.900 --> 17:32.359
No, he's not.

17:32.360 --> 17:35.289
Look at the way he dresses.

17:35.290 --> 17:36.270
He's a nice dresser.

17:36.271 --> 17:37.979
Yeah, but... his hair.

17:37.980 --> 17:41.889
And he definitely moisturises.

17:41.890 --> 17:45.559
Doesn't make him gay. Soft skin
ain't no bad thing for the ladies.

17:45.560 --> 17:49.229
I can't be doing with stubble
rash on the inside of my thighs.

17:49.230 --> 17:51.200
Mimi!

17:52.900 --> 17:54.609
Need a word, mate.

17:54.610 --> 17:55.589
About?

17:55.590 --> 17:57.320
Your pregnant sister.

18:13.210 --> 18:14.188
Y'all right, Jamie?

18:14.189 --> 18:15.180
Yes, mate.

18:17.380 --> 18:19.090
Do you know what she's going to do?

18:19.091 --> 18:21.299
I can't believe she didn't tell me.

18:21.300 --> 18:22.999
She normally tells me everything.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.699
This could fuck everything up!

18:24.700 --> 18:28.639
I take it you won't be putting a
notice in the Manchester Evening News

18:28.640 --> 18:32.549
announcing your paternity cos
it's all about you, isn't it Jamie?

18:32.550 --> 18:34.999
Karen can't find out.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.220
Oh, yes she can.

18:36.221 --> 18:38.909
It's only words exchanged.
Can't see our Gloria telling her.

18:38.910 --> 18:41.099
You weren't exactly
the love of her life.

18:41.100 --> 18:44.290
How did she put it?
"You were just a fuck". That's all.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.659
Find out what she's going to do.

18:49.660 --> 18:52.619
What? Run back here and tell you?

18:52.620 --> 18:53.840
And why would I do that?

19:41.530 --> 19:43.259
What you doing?

19:43.260 --> 19:43.978
Where's the condoms?

19:43.979 --> 19:45.200
I flushed them.

19:45.201 --> 19:48.629
You never normally flush them,
you normally tell me to do it.

19:48.630 --> 19:51.319
You were asleep,
they were on the floor.

19:51.320 --> 19:54.270
I didn't want Cilla toddling in
and picking them up, did I?

19:55.500 --> 19:57.679
Are you all right?

19:57.680 --> 19:59.890
Are you trying to trick me
into getting you pregnant?

20:00.870 --> 20:02.099
What?

20:02.100 --> 20:05.019
Are you saving up
my spunk from the condoms,

20:05.020 --> 20:07.709
and pouring it into yourself
while I'm sleeping?

20:07.710 --> 20:08.700
You're behaving really weird.

20:08.701 --> 20:12.609
Because, clearly,
you're the rational one!

20:12.610 --> 20:14.819
Just so's you know,

20:14.820 --> 20:20.429
squishing jizz out of condoms has
never been top of my "To Do" list.

20:20.430 --> 20:23.379
Are you trying to get pregnant?

20:23.380 --> 20:25.090
Don't be soft.

20:29.500 --> 20:30.970
I've got the horn, now.

20:33.150 --> 20:34.380
Come on.

20:58.110 --> 21:00.799
This barging in is
getting a bit old, isn't it?

21:00.800 --> 21:03.009
Yeah, well,
extenuating circumstances.

21:03.010 --> 21:05.219
Dominic's upstairs.

21:05.220 --> 21:07.420
I've just passed him
on his way to Mass.

21:08.890 --> 21:10.590
Creature of habit, your brother.

21:16.470 --> 21:19.899
I made some enquiries. Thought you
might want to get out of town,

21:19.900 --> 21:23.070
so there's more than enough there
for hotel and travel if you need it.

21:24.300 --> 21:26.980
The fee seems pretty consistent,
clinic to clinic.

21:29.190 --> 21:31.640
Please don't take any chances.

21:33.340 --> 21:36.300
Go somewhere decent,
where they'll look after you.

21:38.240 --> 21:39.700
Your concern is touching.

21:41.190 --> 21:43.879
You seem to have it all worked out.

21:43.880 --> 21:46.058
I'm just trying to help.
There's six grand there.

21:46.059 --> 21:47.290
If you need any more, just ask.

21:47.291 --> 21:49.260
I'll be sure to do that.

22:00.030 --> 22:01.739
D'you need me to come with you?

22:01.740 --> 22:06.390
I think it'd be better all round
if you just fuck off.
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,269
Shane would know.
Just tug it a bit harder.

16:40.270 --> 16:41.730
I don't want to hurt her,
and I'm scared of pulling it off.

16:41.731 --> 16:43.939

I think it'd be better all round

22:16.970 --> 22:19.178
It's only a matter of time
before someone lets slip

22:19.179 --> 22:20.640
that there's a cow on the estate.

22:20.641 --> 22:23.839
Do yourself a favour, mate. Don't
Google "milking" on the internet.

22:23.840 --> 22:25.540
Won't come back the way you thought.

22:25.541 --> 22:28.730
I saw one on YouTube, said you
have to be quite firm with the...

22:29.690 --> 22:31.180
teats.

22:33.870 --> 22:37.039
I was telling Lillian
about Alan and she said,

22:37.040 --> 22:39.989
"There's always someone somewhere
willing to pay over the odds

22:39.990 --> 22:43.399
"to get off on it."
And she was right. Meet Eric.

22:43.400 --> 22:45.599
By day, Planning Officer
from Rochdale.

22:45.600 --> 22:48.049
By night, Heidi fetishist.

22:48.050 --> 22:49.040
Heidi?

22:50.500 --> 22:51.719
Yes, Helmut?

22:51.720 --> 22:53.669
I have finished the milking.

22:53.670 --> 22:54.890
May I go, Mutter?

22:54.891 --> 22:56.620
Jawohl.

22:59.790 --> 23:01.760
You can keep all the milk.

23:08.860 --> 23:10.319
It's warm.

23:10.320 --> 23:12.030
It's a fucking
bodily fluid, dickhead!

23:13.730 --> 23:17.159
I don't care if it's legal,
what you do is a disgrace!

23:17.160 --> 23:18.870
Legalised loan-sharking.

23:20.090 --> 23:23.040
Please, just call me back
when you get this message.

23:29.640 --> 23:33.319
Right. We have one day
to get hold of five grand.

23:33.320 --> 23:35.019
Miracles happen.

23:35.020 --> 23:39.199
Think we deserve one? I have
some friends in very low places.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.880
Try not to worry.

23:45.290 --> 23:46.520
Think of the baby.

23:49.230 --> 23:50.689
He told you?

23:50.690 --> 23:53.620
Yeah. Why didn't you?

23:54.840 --> 23:56.070
Because I'm not.

23:57.530 --> 23:58.520
What?

23:59.740 --> 24:01.439
Why did he say you are?

24:01.440 --> 24:04.129
Because he's just
an arrogant bastard,

24:04.130 --> 24:06.839
who decided to do all the talking
and no listening.

24:06.840 --> 24:10.520
Gloria, I could've told you that!

24:12.460 --> 24:14.670
You should let him know.

24:16.130 --> 24:17.600
I will.

24:39.630 --> 24:41.329
I'll call you back.

24:41.330 --> 24:45.239
That's supposed to be in portions
at the bottom of the freezer by now.

24:45.240 --> 24:45.988
And it will be.

24:45.989 --> 24:47.450
Just doing a spot of marketing.

24:47.451 --> 24:49.899
Letting people see what
they'll get if they win.

24:49.900 --> 24:51.360
A free pint of milk with
every strip of tickets sold.

24:51.361 --> 24:52.829
Pretty enterprising.

24:52.830 --> 24:56.019
If I'd known you weren't up to it,
I wouldn't have wasted my time.

24:56.020 --> 24:57.239
I'm up to it.

24:57.240 --> 25:02.859
I've told them, if that thing shits
in here, I'm not cleaning it up.

25:02.860 --> 25:04.319
It's good for the roses.

25:04.320 --> 25:05.550
Not so good for the carpet.

25:05.551 --> 25:07.999
Right, I'm off for a piss.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.198
If that thing's here when
I come back, I'm going to

25:10.199 --> 25:12.168
stick your heads up its fucking arse!

25:12.169 --> 25:13.130
Oh, there's no need.

25:21.940 --> 25:24.149
Mimi's not pregnant.

25:24.150 --> 25:26.120
Stand any closer,
I'm worried I might be.

25:29.520 --> 25:34.660
It's not Karen, either, so
we're in the clear. Happy days.

25:36.390 --> 25:39.319
Are you not going to
wash your hands?

25:39.320 --> 25:42.239
I just make sure
not to piss on my fingers.

25:42.240 --> 25:43.729
Oh right, yeah.

25:43.730 --> 25:48.359
No, I understand, yeah.
Thanks for trying anyway.

25:48.360 --> 25:50.329
Everything all right?

25:50.330 --> 25:52.780
Never realised how many
fair-weather friends I had.

25:52.781 --> 25:54.719
Y'know, when I had my own parish,

25:54.720 --> 25:56.688
they were tripping over
themselves to help me out.

25:56.689 --> 25:58.160
Well, welcome to the real world.

26:00.600 --> 26:02.310
If there's anything I can do...

26:03.800 --> 26:05.260
Now you're offering me favours?

26:05.261 --> 26:07.710
I trade in favours.

26:13.080 --> 26:15.029
Yeah, Charlie, it's Dom. Look, er,

26:15.030 --> 26:17.240
I need to earn
some money pretty quickly.

26:18.220 --> 26:19.200
Yeah.

26:21.410 --> 26:22.880
No, it's good.

27:08.860 --> 27:10.589
How many tickets, Gloria?

27:10.590 --> 27:11.809
Sorry?

27:11.810 --> 27:13.520
Meat raffle at the Jockey, tomorrow.

27:13.521 --> 27:17.910
Five quid of tickets could
get you 50 quid of meat.

27:19.130 --> 27:20.360
That's a dairy cow, boys.

27:22.320 --> 27:24.529
It's not bred for meat.

27:24.530 --> 27:26.239
It'll taste like feet.

27:26.240 --> 27:27.460
Jamie never said owt.

27:27.461 --> 27:29.910
Maybe he was giving you enough rope.

27:33.820 --> 27:35.040
What we going to do?

27:35.041 --> 27:37.969
We only have to sell it, not eat it.

27:37.970 --> 27:41.909
Tastes like feet, fuck it.
It's got fuck-all to do with us.

27:41.910 --> 27:43.369
Come on, Alan.

27:43.370 --> 27:44.840
Come on, Alan.

27:48.990 --> 27:50.450
Everything all right?

27:52.420 --> 27:53.398
You're keeping it?

27:53.399 --> 27:54.870
I'm not pregnant. I never was.

27:54.871 --> 27:57.319
Why did you lie? Was it a scam?

27:57.320 --> 28:00.479
Fuck you! I never lied.

28:00.480 --> 28:01.709
You told me...

28:01.710 --> 28:05.879
I told you nothing. You're
the one who barged into my home,

28:05.880 --> 28:07.830
full of presumptions,
like the Big Alpha Male,

28:07.831 --> 28:09.529
and came to your own conclusions.

28:09.530 --> 28:11.020
Yeah, well you could
have contradicted me.

28:11.021 --> 28:13.949
It's not my job to tell an idiot
when he's been an idiot.

28:13.950 --> 28:15.650
I've better things
to do with my time.

28:15.651 --> 28:18.099
Oh, but I tell you
what was interesting, though,

28:18.100 --> 28:20.789
seeing how you would have reacted
had I been pregnant.

28:20.790 --> 28:24.959
"Oh, don't worry your pretty
little head. Leave it to the men".

28:24.960 --> 28:26.669
Wasn't like that.

28:26.670 --> 28:28.639
What was it like?

28:28.640 --> 28:31.559
A woman I cared very much about,
who now decides to avoid me

28:31.560 --> 28:34.250
like the plague, may have been
pregnant with my child...

28:35.960 --> 28:38.399
but was choosing
to hide it from me.

28:38.400 --> 28:40.610
That's what it was like.

28:45.030 --> 28:46.969
Go back to Karen.

28:46.970 --> 28:49.419
Play happy families.

28:49.420 --> 28:52.850
I don't need you. Or your money.

29:01.180 --> 29:02.380
Right, tighten that.

29:02.381 --> 29:05.569
Are you sure about this, Father?

29:05.570 --> 29:08.499
Circuit training's one thing,
but fighting's totally different.

29:08.500 --> 29:09.720
Yeah, I'm sure, Charlie.

29:09.721 --> 29:12.169
You really are desperate,
aren't you?

29:12.170 --> 29:13.399
I am that.

29:13.400 --> 29:16.080
When was the last time you ran
further than the length of yourself?

29:17.570 --> 29:19.999
I've got a great tolerance for pain.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.709
Everyone's in with
a punching chance. Five grand, yeah?

29:22.710 --> 29:25.879
I've laid bets.
If you win, you'll clear five.

29:25.880 --> 29:29.069
Honestly. Who is this guy?
How good is he?

29:29.070 --> 29:30.769
Good enough to give long odds.

29:30.770 --> 29:32.740
Have you put a bet on me, Charlie?

29:34.920 --> 29:36.650
I'm not a betting man, Father.

29:37.610 --> 29:38.600
OK.

30:17.260 --> 30:18.240
Oh, fuck!

30:20.190 --> 30:22.399
Half when you're ready, Mimi.

30:22.400 --> 30:25.320
Lover boy's
practically a regular now.

30:27.530 --> 30:29.259
Two nights on the trot, eh?

30:29.260 --> 30:30.718
You only live once, babe.

30:30.719 --> 30:31.948
We're clubbing later,
if you're up for it?

30:31.949 --> 30:33.170
Some other time, maybe.

30:33.171 --> 30:36.339
You're your own boss.
Who's going to pull you up?

30:36.340 --> 30:38.789
Me and Avril've
been there, done that.

30:38.790 --> 30:40.758
Probably while you
were still in nappies.

30:40.759 --> 30:41.980
That's what I'm saying!
Recapture your youth.

30:41.981 --> 30:44.669
Take "No" for an answer, mate.

30:44.670 --> 30:46.879
I might go.

30:46.880 --> 30:49.560
Grab-a-Granny night, is it?

30:50.790 --> 30:52.970
I'm going to shoot some pool.

30:54.700 --> 30:57.389
No of fence,
but he's a fucking idiot.

30:57.390 --> 31:00.559
He can be, but it's
not your place to say.

31:00.560 --> 31:01.780
You still coming?

31:03.270 --> 31:05.449
You'd better believe it.

31:05.450 --> 31:07.660
One, two, three!

31:09.360 --> 31:10.850
What's this?

31:11.810 --> 31:13.040
Sirloin...

31:14.020 --> 31:15.989
I think.

31:15.990 --> 31:17.690
That's definitely sirloin.

31:20.880 --> 31:24.049
I don't know why we didn't
do this in the first place.

31:24.050 --> 31:27.720
Cos it cost another
400 quid of my money!

31:36.290 --> 31:39.720
Stay back, Alan.
You don't want to see this.

31:40.920 --> 31:43.130
What about this?

32:25.710 --> 32:28.160
She's hardly going to hear
her phone in a club, is she?

32:28.161 --> 32:29.859
I wasn't phoning her.

32:29.860 --> 32:31.589
What's with the macho bollocks?

32:31.590 --> 32:33.530
That going to keep
your wife happy, is it?

32:33.531 --> 32:35.979
"I'm so tough, I just don't care."

32:35.980 --> 32:36.959
I care.

32:36.960 --> 32:37.950
She fancied a bit of fun.

32:37.951 --> 32:40.159
Remember fun, don't you, Jackson?

32:40.160 --> 32:42.099
We have a good time.

32:42.100 --> 32:44.070
Before or after
you called her an ugly old crone?

32:44.071 --> 32:46.519
I never called her that.

32:46.520 --> 32:48.960
No. "Grab-a-Granny"
was the phrase, wasn't it?

32:50.190 --> 32:52.609
I can look after
my own marriage, thanks.

32:52.610 --> 32:53.600
Course you can.

32:57.770 --> 32:58.730
Gloria?

32:59.960 --> 33:03.870
If you're pissed, Dominic, just go
straight up. I'm not in the mood.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.230
Jesus Christ, Dominic!

33:10.231 --> 33:11.450
I'm fine.

33:15.120 --> 33:16.350
It's not as bad as it looks.

33:18.560 --> 33:20.760
I couldn't get the money, Sis.

33:22.470 --> 33:23.930
I'm sorry.

33:25.160 --> 33:27.359
This has gone too far.

33:27.360 --> 33:28.830
It's got to end.

33:35.430 --> 33:37.639
Best night I've had in a decade.

33:37.640 --> 33:40.319
Stop it. You'll make me sad.

33:40.320 --> 33:45.959
Chief cook and bottle washer,
that's my role. Mother and wife.

33:45.960 --> 33:51.100
Come here. You're not my mother
and you're not my wife. Mwah!

33:59.430 --> 34:00.650
Oh, fuck...

34:02.360 --> 34:04.560
I know. I'm sorry...

35:00.100 --> 35:01.320
I'm sorry.

35:05.720 --> 35:07.439
Been a bit of a dickhead.

35:07.440 --> 35:09.390
I know.

35:18.200 --> 35:19.660
Coming up?

35:24.080 --> 35:25.300
Yeah.

36:08.210 --> 36:09.438
What are you doing?

36:09.439 --> 36:10.640
Stretching a muscle.

36:12.840 --> 36:17.019
I don't know whether
I'm coming or going... or coming.

36:17.020 --> 36:18.480
What's fucking eating you now?

36:26.070 --> 36:27.290
Tell me this ain't yours.

36:28.760 --> 36:30.960
Fuck's sake, there goes my erection!

37:07.160 --> 37:08.380
Is that him, yeah?

37:08.381 --> 37:09.360
Yeah.

37:10.590 --> 37:12.799
Fucking look at him!

37:12.800 --> 37:13.780
The fuck, man?

37:15.480 --> 37:16.710
Fuck off!

37:17.690 --> 37:19.899
Fuck off!

37:21.400 --> 37:24.569
Oi! Pack it in and fuck off!

37:24.570 --> 37:25.550
Leg it!

37:28.000 --> 37:30.929
Yeah, yeah, all right, mate.

37:30.930 --> 37:32.150
Yep.

37:36.070 --> 37:37.769
What the fuck's happened to you?

37:37.770 --> 37:39.480
Slipped on a banana skin.

37:41.200 --> 37:42.670
I need a favour.

37:51.720 --> 37:55.629
She got herself into a mess with
one of these short-term loans.

37:55.630 --> 37:58.560
It's out of control -
we've tried everything.

38:00.040 --> 38:03.450
She now thinks that the only
thing she can do is to go.

38:05.420 --> 38:07.630
I wouldn't ask
if it wasn't desperate.

38:08.850 --> 38:11.540
If she goes, Jamie,
she won't come back.

38:12.760 --> 38:13.990
That might suit me.

38:15.450 --> 38:16.920
You know that isn't true.

38:23.280 --> 38:24.500
One condition...

38:26.200 --> 38:30.139
she never finds out
it came from me.

38:30.140 --> 38:32.319
I want your word on that, Dom.

38:32.320 --> 38:34.770
Of course.

38:37.720 --> 38:38.680
Right.

38:39.910 --> 38:41.880
I'll catch you up, I have business.

38:46.770 --> 38:49.459
Thank you... I'm so grateful.

38:49.460 --> 38:50.920
It was nothing.

38:51.910 --> 38:54.359
I've got folk waiting for me,
er, I'm sorry.

38:54.360 --> 38:56.060
At least stay for a cup of tea.

39:03.400 --> 39:04.390
Yeah, it's mine.

39:06.840 --> 39:08.060
You lied to me?

39:09.760 --> 39:12.209
I omitted the truth -
that's different.

39:12.210 --> 39:13.200
Only in the dictionary.

39:16.120 --> 39:19.559
I didn't know if I was or I wasn't.

39:19.560 --> 39:23.470
My stage in life, your periods might
not be as regular as they used to be.

39:26.400 --> 39:29.350
Then I got to thinking about it
and kinda liked the idea.

39:31.290 --> 39:32.760
You should've consulted me.

39:33.980 --> 39:35.439
Yeah, I should have...

39:35.440 --> 39:39.379
but I didn't want to raise
any false alarms...

39:39.380 --> 39:41.320
then looking stupid.

39:46.700 --> 39:47.680
Are you?

39:48.670 --> 39:49.650
Pregnant?

39:52.580 --> 39:54.040
No, I'm not.

39:55.270 --> 39:58.940
I'm just some stupid old woman who
thought she might've got lucky.

40:03.840 --> 40:07.989
You can have my spunk
any time you want, you know?

40:07.990 --> 40:09.720
I've got a fucking bucket-load.

40:11.900 --> 40:12.640
Ah, thanks love.

40:26.110 --> 40:29.780
That's what a life amounts to these
days, does it? Carry-on luggage?

40:30.740 --> 40:32.950
All the rest is just stuff.

40:34.170 --> 40:35.879
Look...

40:35.880 --> 40:38.589
I'm sorry about this, Dominic.

40:38.590 --> 40:42.500
I really appreciate all your help.

40:43.720 --> 40:44.950
Your debt's cleared.

40:48.120 --> 40:49.339
How?

40:49.340 --> 40:50.320
A friend.

40:51.550 --> 40:54.240
Your phone should stop ringing now.

40:56.920 --> 40:59.609
How are we going to pay it back?

40:59.610 --> 41:01.100
Slowly.

41:11.610 --> 41:13.079
Special occasion?

41:13.080 --> 41:15.039
Yeah, I'm out with my wife.

41:15.040 --> 41:17.969
You're overdoing it,
it's a bit pukey.

41:17.970 --> 41:19.918
Yeah, you're trying a bit too hard.

41:19.919 --> 41:20.900
Can't win for losing.

41:24.090 --> 41:25.319
You all right?

41:25.320 --> 41:27.260
Something's changed.

41:30.210 --> 41:32.399
What can I get you?

41:32.400 --> 41:34.599
A large gin and tonic and...?

41:34.600 --> 41:35.830
I'll have a single
of your finest malt.

41:35.831 --> 41:39.019
Double single malt, please.

41:39.020 --> 41:39.740
What's he done, then?

41:39.741 --> 41:42.690
Oh, he's just been a good brother.

41:54.670 --> 41:58.339
And... Five and four - 54.

41:58.340 --> 42:00.310
House!

42:03.000 --> 42:05.920
This is yours, is it?

42:08.850 --> 42:13.269
Lucky for someone - 13!

42:13.270 --> 42:14.730
Here!

42:22.560 --> 42:25.239
Can't wait to see her face when
she's running free again.

42:25.240 --> 42:27.959
Except she doesn't really run,
more like waddles.

42:27.960 --> 42:29.420
You sure they have to take her?

42:29.421 --> 42:32.589
It's a fucking petting zoo -
what they going to do, kick her out?

42:32.590 --> 42:34.320
Make her sell the Big Issue?

42:36.020 --> 42:37.720
Where is she...?

42:38.950 --> 42:42.139
Never mind where - how?!
She was tied in a triple knot.

42:42.140 --> 42:45.069
How did she open the door?

42:45.070 --> 42:47.280
Alan!

42:49.220 --> 42:50.439
Alan! Alan!

42:50.440 --> 42:52.169
Alan!

42:52.170 --> 42:52.890
Alan!

42:55.100 --> 42:56.560
Alan!

42:58.030 --> 42:59.760
Come back!

43:01.700 --> 43:02.920
Alan!

43:09.040 --> 43:11.009
Alan! Alan!

43:11.010 --> 43:12.239
Alan! Alan!

43:12.240 --> 43:13.459
Alan! Alan!

43:13.460 --> 43:14.420
Alan, where are you?!

43:22.030 --> 43:23.230
She's gone, bro.

43:31.800 --> 43:32.780
It's all right, mate.

43:42.070 --> 43:43.050
Was it you?

43:44.520 --> 43:46.239
Was what me?

43:46.240 --> 43:48.190
No more games, please.

43:49.410 --> 43:50.640
I don't know what
you're talking about.

43:50.641 --> 43:52.099
OK.

43:52.100 --> 43:54.309
So it wasn't you.

43:54.310 --> 43:55.530
All the same, thank you.

44:01.410 --> 44:02.130
You're welcome.

44:10.460 --> 44:12.430
I didn't want you to leave.

44:19.030 --> 44:21.240
I didn't want to not see you again.

44:44.230 --> 44:46.439
'People are the stuff of life.

44:46.440 --> 44:49.840
'People have real worth,
real value...'

44:59.160 --> 45:03.310
'..so long as no-one ever gets
close enough to hurt...'

45:05.280 --> 45:08.920
'..because no amount of money can
ever protect you from that.'

46:02.700 --> 46:05.000
You must be the one they
call Terry the terrapin.

46:05.100 --> 46:09.000
I've heard speak of you. -And what
do they say of me, Alan the cow?

46:09.100 --> 46:12.678
You survived many months in the pocket
of one who soaked in piss and alcohol.

46:13.001 --> 46:14.369
This is true.

46:14.670 --> 46:18.059
And that you have evolved and taken on the
characteristics of the one they call

46:18.600 --> 46:20.000
Frank Gallagher.

46:20.301 --> 46:22.369
This also is true.

46:22.505 --> 46:25.100
We have much to learn from you.

46:25.205 --> 46:27.939
Got any drugs?
