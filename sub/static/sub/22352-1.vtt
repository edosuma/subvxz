-So very close, Susan.
-I think it's more dangerous to move her.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.042
If no one's found her yet,
maybe they never will.

17:23.125 --> 17:26.754
What if in a couple of years,
they decide to expand the resort, or...

17:26.837 --> 17:29.381
one of their guests goes
to retrieve a tennis ball and, uh...

17:29.465 --> 17:31.175
I don't know, trips over a skull instead?

17:31.258 --> 17:33.469
Fine, let's say someone
does find Talvinder.

17:33.552 --> 17:35.471
Everyone thinks Owen killed her.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.514
Owen was a suspect in the disappearance.

17:37.598 --> 17:40.809
Right. Now, Owen will be
the prime suspect in the murder.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.979
I'm no CSI expert,
but the crime scene we left behind,

17:44.063 --> 17:47.107
-I'm pretty sure it's full of evidence.
-Which they'll tie back to Owen.

17:47.191 --> 17:49.735
Owen is dead, Susan.
They can't question him, can they?

17:49.818 --> 17:51.195
But they can question us.

17:51.278 --> 17:54.156
So if one of us makes a mistake
or goes off script--

17:54.239 --> 17:57.493
Look, we have the freaking Manson Family
watching our every move.

17:57.576 --> 17:59.620
We've got GI Gene on a snowmobile.
We're screwed.

17:59.703 --> 18:03.207
Okay, yes, we're taking a risk,
but if we leave Talvinder out there,

18:03.290 --> 18:04.666
someone is gonna find her.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.002
We need to gather her remains,
take them to the city,

18:07.086 --> 18:10.089
and destroy them once and for all,
like we should have five years ago.

18:11.882 --> 18:15.344
I find it weird to come all this way
for the weekend.

18:15.427 --> 18:17.888
They said they worked here
when it was a summer camp.

18:17.971 --> 18:20.224
You come up in the summer,
not during a deep freeze.

18:20.307 --> 18:23.060
This land is special, Gene. It's powerful.

18:23.143 --> 18:24.853
It draws you in, draws you back.

18:24.937 --> 18:28.398
It's true. A particularly strong ley line
crosses right through here.

18:28.482 --> 18:32.945
-Is that why you're selling most of it?
-More people get to enjoy our bounty,

18:33.028 --> 18:34.863
and we get to stay together
as a community.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.241
-Gotcha.
-You should be happy, Gene.

18:37.324 --> 18:41.036
You're the only outfitter for miles.
The resort will make you a rich man.

18:41.120 --> 18:44.957
If I wanted to be rich,
my shop would be a hundred klicks south.

18:45.040 --> 18:47.042
I might stick around for the weekend.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.877
-Why?
-Just to keep an eye on things.

18:48.961 --> 18:53.423
Gene, you beautiful, suspicious soul, you.

18:53.507 --> 18:55.843
You can be too trusting and you know it.

18:55.926 --> 18:58.846
Think of me as your guard dog
in case things go sideways.

18:58.929 --> 19:02.141
You're welcome to stay,
but you really don't have to.

19:02.224 --> 19:03.058
Judith?

19:06.270 --> 19:08.689
Hey, you okay?

19:09.481 --> 19:11.024
I'm fine.

19:11.608 --> 19:12.776
No, you're not okay.

19:14.570 --> 19:16.530
If those tears could talk,
what would they say?

19:18.323 --> 19:20.993
I guess I'm just triggered.

19:21.076 --> 19:26.123
-I'm trying to get over it, but I can't.
-Okay. Try to talk through the trigger.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.793
Let us in, let us help you.

19:29.877 --> 19:31.378
Let us help you sort it out.

19:32.671 --> 19:33.881
It's just that...

19:35.174 --> 19:38.177
This is our home. I mean, our home.

19:38.260 --> 19:42.222
We live here, we're safe here,
and those-- I just, they're--

19:42.306 --> 19:44.141
They're outsiders,
and I want them to go away.

19:44.224 --> 19:46.268
I just want them to go away, and I--

19:47.686 --> 19:51.690
-Sorry, Gene. I don't mean you.
-It's okay. It's okay.

19:51.773 --> 19:54.359
You're just worried
things are gonna change.

19:54.443 --> 19:57.821
Remember this,
our strength is in each other.

19:57.905 --> 20:02.409
No matter how many strangers appear
on our doorstep, we won't change.

20:02.492 --> 20:05.996
We need to open our hearts
when we're afraid and let others in.

20:06.079 --> 20:08.957
-Everything's gonna be all right, Judith.
-Of course it is.

20:10.751 --> 20:13.837
It's okay. We won't shame you
for having feelings about this.

20:20.844 --> 20:22.804
That, uh, sauna on the hill
up and running?

20:24.389 --> 20:27.184
Yeah. Of course, Gene. Go enjoy.

20:32.147 --> 20:34.524
[all humming]

20:59.299 --> 21:00.884
[sighs]

21:09.017 --> 21:10.811
[sighs]

21:18.902 --> 21:20.112
[loud thud]

21:24.491 --> 21:25.993
Gimme a break!

21:32.291 --> 21:33.792
I'm trying to relax here!

21:35.210 --> 21:36.837
That's what this place is about, right?

21:48.515 --> 21:51.018
-[loud thud]
-You gotta be kidding.

21:54.021 --> 21:55.939
[groaning]

22:04.114 --> 22:06.116
[sizzling]

22:12.581 --> 22:14.374
-Hey, Glenn.
-Hey.

22:15.917 --> 22:17.627
Missed you at yoga earlier.

22:17.711 --> 22:19.046
Oh, no.

22:19.129 --> 22:22.257
Did I miss yoga again? Oh, shoot!

22:22.341 --> 22:23.467
[chuckles]

22:23.550 --> 22:26.720
-That come in here with Gene?
-I didn't kill the cow myself.

22:28.388 --> 22:31.058
Glenn, look, you haven't even
been with us for two months.

22:31.141 --> 22:33.602
Your probationary period isn't up yet.

22:33.685 --> 22:37.397
While we respect members' choices,
we are striving to be a vegan community.

22:37.481 --> 22:39.941
I think I know where you're going,
and let me tell you,

22:40.025 --> 22:42.903
you cook me a tofu steak
that's half as good as this one,

22:42.986 --> 22:45.947
and I will bow to your vegan gods, okay?

22:46.031 --> 22:49.326
But if not,
then you must moo-ve along.

22:49.409 --> 22:51.411
[laughs]

22:51.495 --> 22:53.121
[Renee sighs]

22:53.205 --> 22:55.957
Hey, there.
What's your name again? Remind me.

22:56.041 --> 22:58.085
-Noah.
-Noah, right.

22:58.168 --> 22:59.920
How's the cabin?

23:00.003 --> 23:02.005
[stammers] The cabin is... is great.

23:02.089 --> 23:05.008
We were actually just gonna go
do some exploring, and, um...

23:05.092 --> 23:07.302
I wanted to fill up on coffee.

23:07.385 --> 23:11.515
-Next pot's on me.
-Sure. Where you off to?

23:12.557 --> 23:15.977
-You know, here and there.
-Here and there?

23:16.061 --> 23:17.521
Never heard of it.

23:18.105 --> 23:20.690
You wouldn't happen to know
where Gene might be.

23:20.774 --> 23:24.236
-We wanna firm up Monday with him.
-Yeah, he's up at the sauna.

23:24.319 --> 23:26.655
He's actually decided
to stay with us for the weekend.

23:26.738 --> 23:30.784
You can ask him about Monday over dinner,
which will be vegan and healthy.

23:30.867 --> 23:31.910
[Glenn laughs]

23:33.203 --> 23:35.038
Sure you're all right?

23:35.122 --> 23:38.208
Yeah, no. No, everything's...
everything's fine.

23:38.291 --> 23:43.171
Just... I think it's a little weird being
back here after all this time, you know?

23:44.756 --> 23:46.633
Okay, well, have fun.

23:48.218 --> 23:51.388
-You're gonna wanna be careful out there.
-What's that?

23:52.764 --> 23:56.768
Well, if you get yourself in a spot
of trouble out there in the woods...

23:56.852 --> 23:59.855
nobody around to get you out,
you know?

24:01.731 --> 24:02.607
Right. Thanks.

24:05.652 --> 24:06.486
You're welcome.

24:54.117 --> 24:54.951
[Andi] Peter?

24:58.788 --> 24:59.873
Let's get this over with.

25:01.666 --> 25:03.335
[exhales heavily]

25:11.801 --> 25:13.386
Noah, come on. Help me with this.

25:23.063 --> 25:28.276
It's just gonna be a skeleton...
after all this time, right?

25:28.360 --> 25:31.696
Okay, okay. Come on.

25:31.780 --> 25:34.532
[grunts]

25:34.616 --> 25:36.409
[both grunting]

25:43.333 --> 25:45.543
[both panting]

25:51.675 --> 25:53.677
Shit.

25:53.760 --> 25:55.595
-What?
-She's not in here.

25:55.679 --> 25:58.473
-What do you mean?
-She's gone. She's not in here.

26:23.290 --> 26:24.833
[door opens]

26:25.250 --> 26:27.711
-I'm sorry.
-Jesus! I didn't mean to scare you.

26:27.794 --> 26:30.046
-You didn't scare me. I was just--
-I didn't?

26:30.130 --> 26:35.135
You didn't scare me. I was just-- No.
I was just startled.

26:36.094 --> 26:37.387
Um...

26:39.222 --> 26:40.849
What do you, um...

26:42.267 --> 26:44.936
What do you think
about all these people just...

26:46.271 --> 26:48.148
being up here in our space?

26:49.441 --> 26:51.484
I don't-- I...

26:54.321 --> 26:57.240
I don't know what they're doing up here.
It doesn't...

26:57.324 --> 27:00.327
All the way up here during winter?
It just... It seems weird.

27:00.410 --> 27:04.748
It's weird. It is weird.
And suspicious.

27:04.831 --> 27:07.250
Yes. But I...

27:09.044 --> 27:13.006
I don't know what I'm suspicious of.
They're kids. What could they be doing?

27:13.089 --> 27:14.090
Probably nothing.

27:17.302 --> 27:18.511
Still, you never know.

27:20.972 --> 27:21.848
Ah...

27:24.392 --> 27:25.727
What?

27:25.810 --> 27:29.647
I think that maybe, for a little while,
we should be a little less open-hearted.

27:30.565 --> 27:32.525
A little more on guard.

27:32.609 --> 27:33.443
You know?

27:35.737 --> 27:37.072
Someone found her.

27:37.155 --> 27:38.907
Someone found Talvinder,
and now we're here,

27:38.990 --> 27:40.325
and they're gonna figure out why.

27:40.408 --> 27:42.327
-Maybe she wasn't dead when...
-She was dead.

27:42.410 --> 27:44.371
We don't know that, not for sure.

27:44.454 --> 27:46.247
We weren't right the first time.

27:46.331 --> 27:48.625
If someone knows,
they go to the police, right?

27:48.708 --> 27:51.753
-They would, right?
-Okay, we need to just calm down.

27:51.836 --> 27:54.130
We need to calm down and we need to think.

27:54.214 --> 27:55.256
I can't believe this.

27:55.340 --> 27:58.218
Believe it, because being pissy
and panicking is not gonna help us.

27:58.301 --> 28:00.804
-Well, you're doing both right now.
-Fuck you, Susan.

28:00.887 --> 28:02.722
You're still the same bitch
you always were.

28:02.806 --> 28:04.849
-We confess.
-What?

28:06.101 --> 28:09.896
We go to the police, we go back,
and we confess.

28:09.979 --> 28:11.064
[scoffs]

28:11.147 --> 28:12.482
What the fuck are you talking about?

28:12.565 --> 28:15.360
We get ahead of this and do what
we should've done five years ago.

28:15.443 --> 28:17.862
Okay, if someone has a better idea,
let's hear it.

28:17.946 --> 28:19.906
It wasn't premeditated,
it was an accident.

28:19.989 --> 28:21.991
Yeah, maybe at first.

28:22.075 --> 28:24.202
We don't have to tell them everything.
Just enough to--

28:24.285 --> 28:25.829
To what, Peter? To what?

28:28.957 --> 28:29.958
Are you happy?

28:34.212 --> 28:35.422
Are any of you?

28:40.510 --> 28:42.470
Maybe the only way for us to move on...

28:44.264 --> 28:47.684
is to find closure...
for Talvinder and Owen.

28:47.767 --> 28:48.768
And ourselves.

28:52.188 --> 28:53.022
[Susan] No.

28:55.024 --> 28:58.945
Don't go and try and ruin my life
because you're feeling guilty!

28:59.028 --> 29:01.781
-All I'm saying is--
-I don't give a shit what you're saying!

29:01.865 --> 29:04.826
-[Andi] Susan.
-I have a husband and a son!

29:04.909 --> 29:08.621
-I have moved on with my life!
-Peter is just suggesting another option.

29:08.705 --> 29:10.457
It's just something for us to consider.

29:10.540 --> 29:12.834
-We would go to jail.
-[Peter] We would, yes.

29:12.917 --> 29:16.671
But manslaughter?
We'd be gone for a couple of years, man.

29:16.755 --> 29:19.299
This isn't a democracy, it's murder.

29:19.382 --> 29:21.801
And I'm not going to jail,
not for one goddamn second.

29:21.885 --> 29:24.596
-Do you understand?
-You don't get to decide for us.

29:25.722 --> 29:28.099
Okay, that's fine.
We'll just take it to a vote.

29:29.100 --> 29:31.060
All those in favor of going to the police?

29:33.021 --> 29:34.397
And all those opposed?

29:40.278 --> 29:41.946
Can you do the math, Andi?

29:44.199 --> 29:45.700
We're not going to the police!

30:01.382 --> 30:02.842
You're so tense.

30:06.846 --> 30:08.223
You're full of knots.

30:13.937 --> 30:16.189
What's going on in there, huh?

30:16.773 --> 30:19.234
Yeah, I think it's the lack of sunlight.

30:19.317 --> 30:20.527
Huh.

30:20.610 --> 30:24.781
-This time of year always gets to me.
-You need to get out in the sunshine.

30:26.449 --> 30:27.492
Vitamin D.

30:27.575 --> 30:30.036
Oh, shit. Freeze my ass off
while I'm at it.

30:30.119 --> 30:34.249
These scars. They show that
your physical body has healed,

30:34.332 --> 30:36.125
and that is a blessing, Mark,
it really is.

30:36.209 --> 30:40.463
But sometimes it feels like
they're also a barrier.

30:40.547 --> 30:43.758
A wall. The only way
we can break down that wall

30:43.842 --> 30:46.511
is if you talk openly

30:46.594 --> 30:49.138
about what actually happened that day.

30:57.021 --> 30:59.107
Uh, you know, I'm gonna take your advice.
I'm gonna...

31:00.441 --> 31:02.569
I'm gonna go outside.

31:02.652 --> 31:03.820
Get myself some sunshine.

31:07.532 --> 31:08.533
Thanks for the massage.

31:09.909 --> 31:10.910
Anytime.

31:12.161 --> 31:14.372
[door opens]

31:26.593 --> 31:27.886
Someone knows, Peter.

31:29.637 --> 31:32.015
-We don't know that for sure.
-Yes, we do.

31:33.308 --> 31:35.852
Someone knows,
and they're gonna make us pay.

31:37.812 --> 31:39.689
What do you wanna do?

31:41.357 --> 31:42.650
I wanna go home.

31:44.193 --> 31:45.904
I wanna forget about all of this.

31:50.491 --> 31:51.326
Last year...

31:52.869 --> 31:54.203
I'm halfway around the world...

31:56.122 --> 31:57.790
managing an NGO...

31:58.833 --> 32:01.586
some big agricultural project...

32:04.047 --> 32:05.340
I'm doing good work, you know?

32:06.674 --> 32:07.675
I'm back...

32:12.764 --> 32:14.390
And then I see her.

32:18.895 --> 32:19.896
Not actually her.

32:21.189 --> 32:22.190
Just some girl...

32:23.900 --> 32:25.526
on our team from India.

32:25.610 --> 32:26.945
Could've been Talvinder's twin.

32:31.366 --> 32:32.700
And have a nervous breakdown.

32:36.537 --> 32:37.705
She haunts me.

32:47.757 --> 32:48.758
This secret...

32:51.094 --> 32:55.056
has killed every single relationship
in my life.

33:00.353 --> 33:01.813
My friends...

33:03.856 --> 33:05.066
my family...

33:07.735 --> 33:08.778
lovers.

33:16.536 --> 33:18.037
Do you understand?

33:18.121 --> 33:18.955
I do.

33:43.146 --> 33:44.981
[kissing]

34:15.678 --> 34:18.765
-[Talvinder] Oh, my God!
-[Peter laughs]

34:19.557 --> 34:20.767
[Talvinder] I'm sorry.

34:20.850 --> 34:23.478
No, it's okay. It's supposed to be scary.

34:23.561 --> 34:24.979
-Yeah.
-It's adorable.

34:27.148 --> 34:29.776
Okay, we're down to kernels and salts.

34:29.859 --> 34:33.154
-I'll get some more, babe.
-No, it's okay. I'll get it.

34:33.237 --> 34:36.115
You guys stay here, be brave.
I'll be back in a minute.

34:38.910 --> 34:40.119
[Talvinder shrieks]

34:40.203 --> 34:42.497
-I can't! I can't do this!
-Talvinder...

34:42.580 --> 34:44.457
-Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
-Really?

34:44.540 --> 34:46.918
What are you apologizing for?

34:47.001 --> 34:50.671
Because I'm third-wheeling
your date with Andi.

34:51.839 --> 34:54.342
Acting like a big chicken baby.

34:54.425 --> 34:57.845
-I should probably go sit with my kids.
-No, Talvinder, it's fine.

35:00.473 --> 35:01.933
Wanna know a secret?

35:03.142 --> 35:03.976
Yeah.

35:07.021 --> 35:10.441
It's all corn syrup and food coloring.

35:10.525 --> 35:11.901
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

35:11.984 --> 35:14.070
This whole time,
I thought they'd kill real people.

35:14.153 --> 35:17.073
-No, it's all just make-believe.
-Oh, my God. Oh, I...!

35:17.156 --> 35:21.327
Hey, okay, all right, come on.
Come on, just scootch on over.

35:23.246 --> 35:25.790
You have to warn me
when the scary parts are.

35:25.873 --> 35:26.958
I'm not gonna say nothing.

35:52.567 --> 35:53.860
They can't stop us, you know?

35:55.361 --> 35:57.280
They can't stop us
from doing what's right.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.826
You wanna go behind their backs?

36:04.912 --> 36:05.955
I don't care anymore.

36:09.584 --> 36:10.585
I'm done lying.

36:15.756 --> 36:17.091
It's time we face justice.

36:20.386 --> 36:23.139
-I thought you agreed.
-I do.

36:25.516 --> 36:26.517
-But...
-What?

36:31.480 --> 36:33.733
If we do all that...

36:33.816 --> 36:37.528
If we do the right thing, then what?

36:46.412 --> 36:47.413
I loved you, Andi.

36:49.790 --> 36:52.460
I know... I know I screwed things up.

36:52.543 --> 36:56.297
We both did, but maybe we can't get it
back to where it once was, but...

36:57.882 --> 36:59.342
Hey, we can try.

37:02.553 --> 37:05.306
Starting with conjugal visits?

37:05.389 --> 37:06.224
What?

37:07.308 --> 37:12.438
Conjugal visits. They don't work that way
between prisoners, so scratch that.

37:12.521 --> 37:13.648
What are you doing?

37:13.731 --> 37:15.900
I'm just talking this through, for real.

37:15.983 --> 37:18.527
I mean, we'd better
if we're gonna do this, right?

37:19.695 --> 37:20.696
So, um...

37:22.240 --> 37:26.202
Uh, we both get out of jail, and, um...

37:26.285 --> 37:31.666
we have no money, no jobs,
criminal records.

37:33.709 --> 37:35.169
So then what?

37:35.253 --> 37:40.675
We pick up where we left off
and move into social housing

37:40.758 --> 37:43.844
and collect welfare
and live happily ever after?

37:48.140 --> 37:50.768
-How long are you gonna punish me?
-I'm just being realistic.

37:50.851 --> 37:54.981
No, you're punishing me...
for Talvinder. You never stopped.

37:56.148 --> 38:00.069
I'm just supposed to forget what you did
because you made me come?

38:00.152 --> 38:02.196
I made a mistake, Andi!

38:02.280 --> 38:05.241
Yeah, you're fucking right
you made a mistake.

38:05.324 --> 38:07.326
And it led directly to what happened.

38:07.410 --> 38:09.161
What?

38:09.245 --> 38:12.164
-So it's my fault?
-It's always been your fucking fault.

38:18.254 --> 38:21.882
Well, the difference
between me and you, Andi,

38:21.966 --> 38:24.719
is that I take responsibility
for my mistakes.

38:25.803 --> 38:27.305
I own up to them, but you...

38:28.806 --> 38:32.268
You refuse to admit that it was...

38:32.351 --> 38:33.686
What, Peter?

38:34.729 --> 38:37.273
-Go on, say it. I know you want to.
-No.

38:41.444 --> 38:42.445
You're a victim.

38:44.488 --> 38:45.948
That's how you define yourself.

38:48.951 --> 38:51.829
Way before Talvinder, and you're not
gonna get anymore ammo from me.

38:56.917 --> 39:00.421
[door opens, closes]

39:42.004 --> 39:44.215
I could stare at these trees for hours.

39:47.927 --> 39:50.596
To be honest, sometimes
there's nothing else to do around here.

39:55.309 --> 39:57.895
You've got the weight of the world
on your shoulders, don't you?

40:01.440 --> 40:05.111
We can talk about it, or I can go
back inside and leave you alone.

40:05.194 --> 40:06.404
I don't know you.

40:06.487 --> 40:09.073
Well, that's perfect.
I've got no horse in this race.

40:11.742 --> 40:14.620
Although if you do decide
you wanna talk, um...

40:19.458 --> 40:20.918
What, I've gotta put this out?

40:22.378 --> 40:24.213
Is it against the rules?

40:24.296 --> 40:26.882
I was kinda hoping
that I could bum one off you.

40:46.110 --> 40:49.238
So what's going on? You got boy troubles?

40:49.321 --> 40:51.699
It's a little more complicated
than that, but...

40:53.242 --> 40:54.452
yeah, that's part of it.

40:56.662 --> 40:57.997
Is it one of your friends?

41:01.000 --> 41:04.587
Every time I see Peter, the same thing
that always happens, happens.

41:06.714 --> 41:07.756
And what's that?

41:08.799 --> 41:10.759
Get in a fight.

41:10.843 --> 41:14.388
And then he says the one thing he knows
will cut me to my core.

41:17.683 --> 41:19.977
Why do I do that?

41:20.060 --> 41:21.770
Why do I let him hurt me?

41:22.938 --> 41:25.024
Good question. Why do you?

41:25.107 --> 41:27.443
Are you saying this is my fault?

41:27.526 --> 41:30.779
You are the only person who can keep
putting yourself in the same situation

41:30.863 --> 41:32.239
that you keep finding yourself in.

41:33.616 --> 41:36.452
So, in that respect, yeah, maybe it is.

41:38.204 --> 41:39.997
Maybe you want it.

41:40.080 --> 41:43.167
Why would I do that? Why would I want it?

41:45.127 --> 41:46.337
You wanna be vulnerable...

41:47.505 --> 41:51.884
which can bring you pain...
or pleasure...

41:51.967 --> 41:52.968
or both.

41:55.930 --> 41:57.806
You still have feelings
for this Peter guy?

42:01.352 --> 42:02.353
Shouldn't.

42:02.436 --> 42:05.105
No. Should, shouldn't, doesn't matter.

42:05.189 --> 42:06.273
Do you or don't you?

42:14.281 --> 42:17.034
The universe doesn't often
deal out second chances.

42:18.661 --> 42:19.828
But if she has...

42:21.205 --> 42:25.668
and you still wanna be with this boy,
but you're too afraid of getting hurt...

42:27.086 --> 42:30.130
then you will regret
not taking this chance.

42:32.633 --> 42:37.012
You're gonna regret not doing everything
that you can to make it work this time.

43:16.552 --> 43:17.553
Peter!

43:22.391 --> 43:23.392
Peter!

43:36.071 --> 43:38.449
[gasps]

44:13.192 --> 44:14.193
Andi!

44:23.202 --> 44:25.371
Shit. Andi!

44:35.214 --> 44:36.382
Andi, what are you doing?

44:43.681 --> 44:45.557
[inhales]

44:59.238 --> 45:00.781
[gasping]

45:02.699 --> 45:05.577
Somebody help me!

45:09.289 --> 45:12.084
[screams] Help!

45:21.677 --> 45:22.678
Andi!

45:27.975 --> 45:28.976
Andi!

45:38.610 --> 45:41.613
[screaming] Help!

45:47.286 --> 45:49.121
Help. Help me.

45:51.874 --> 45:55.335
Why are you doing this?

45:55.419 --> 45:59.256
Please, just let me go!

45:59.882 --> 46:01.758
No!

46:01.842 --> 46:03.427
Oh, my God! No, no--!

46:03.510 --> 46:06.430
[screams]

46:06.513 --> 46:08.098
[gurgles]

46:16.440 --> 46:17.900
Andi!

46:17.983 --> 46:20.235
Andi!

46:36.710 --> 46:38.795
[sobs]

46:45.802 --> 46:47.679
[screams]

47:03.195 --> 47:05.489
There's no dial tone, nothing.

47:05.572 --> 47:07.824
Our only connection
to the outside world is gone.

47:07.908 --> 47:09.409
-That's great.
-It happens.

47:09.493 --> 47:11.328
Oh, yeah? Tell me...

47:11.411 --> 47:14.039
do people normally get murdered
while you wait, though?

47:15.791 --> 47:19.002
-We'll try again in a few minutes.
-Okay. And if it's still not working?

47:19.086 --> 47:23.173
Yeah, look, why don't you guys
take Peter back to his cabin?

47:23.257 --> 47:25.342
I think he could use some rest.

47:25.425 --> 47:28.929
And we'll come get you
when we find Gene, okay?

47:29.012 --> 47:30.347
Hey.

47:30.430 --> 47:32.474
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

47:32.558 --> 47:33.517
Okay?

47:34.434 --> 47:35.769
Okay.

47:38.188 --> 47:40.107
What the fuck
was she doing out there by herself?

47:42.901 --> 47:44.361
Why did she go back?

47:44.444 --> 47:47.114
Someone knows. Someone knows,
and now they're gonna come for us.

47:47.197 --> 47:49.324
Susan, you need to calm down, okay?

47:49.408 --> 47:51.535
Andi was bled out!

47:51.618 --> 47:55.539
She was tied up and bled out!
So don't tell me to calm down!

47:59.293 --> 48:00.752
Oh, my God.

48:05.382 --> 48:07.801
[Peter] Get the fuck off me!

48:07.884 --> 48:09.219
[sobbing]

48:09.303 --> 48:11.763
[Peter] Fuck! Dawn, stop! She's alive!

48:11.847 --> 48:13.890
Yes, and we need to do
something about that.

48:13.974 --> 48:16.268
-We have to take her back.
-What do you think she'll do?

48:17.311 --> 48:21.231
Do you think she's gonna thank us and say,
"These five jokesters almost killed me,

48:21.315 --> 48:23.025
but then saved my life, so we're good"?

48:23.108 --> 48:24.943
No, she's gonna say we took her here

48:25.027 --> 48:27.863
got her drunk,
and tried to fucking kill her.

48:27.946 --> 48:33.160
-[screams] I won't!
-No, we didn't mean to!

48:33.243 --> 48:34.870
It's her word against ours.

48:34.953 --> 48:37.414
Please, guys,
if we take her back right now--

48:37.497 --> 48:41.877
If we take her back, we're going to jail.
Attempted murder, assault.

48:41.960 --> 48:44.504
-She's alive!
-Yes. And you heard her, right?

48:44.588 --> 48:45.589
She threatened us.

48:45.672 --> 48:48.759
She can destroy us,
so we need to finish this.

48:48.842 --> 48:50.427
We need to finish this tonight.

48:51.511 --> 48:55.807
No, we just took her here to scare her,
teach her a lesson, that's all!

48:55.891 --> 48:58.101
Susan, the plan fucking changed.

48:58.185 --> 48:59.686
What are we gonna do now?

49:00.687 --> 49:03.315
-I... I can't do this.
-[Talvinder sobbing]

49:04.024 --> 49:07.653
-Peter.
-[Talvinder] Susan!

49:11.198 --> 49:13.033
-I can't do this.
-Susan!

49:13.116 --> 49:14.451
[Talvinder] Peter.

49:14.534 --> 49:19.331
Peter, I love you. Peter, I'm sorry.

49:19.414 --> 49:20.874
I'm sorry.

49:27.214 --> 49:28.715
[Talvinder sobbing]

49:28.799 --> 49:31.176
Peter, I love you.

49:31.259 --> 49:34.805
What do we do now, Dawn?
[sniffs]

49:35.555 --> 49:38.016
[screams]

49:38.100 --> 49:39.101
[Peter] No!
