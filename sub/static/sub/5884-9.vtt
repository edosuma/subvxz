<i>Previously on
AMC's Mad Men...</i>

00:02.984 --> 00:04.407
Sally needs to see
a psychiatrist.

00:04.584 --> 00:05.809
Why? Because she
couldn't hear.

00:05.976 --> 00:08.513
She's out of control.
I thought you'd be concerned.

00:08.632 --> 00:11.344
You've crossed the border
from lubricated to morose.

00:12.552 --> 00:13.809
Ken has accounts.

00:13.961 --> 00:16.640
Fillmore Auto Parts because
entered the Nation arena.

00:16.831 --> 00:18.632
Abe.
Are you with Joyce?

00:18.778 --> 00:19.592
Are you?

00:19.817 --> 00:21.857
It's basic training.
I'll be back.

00:21.992 --> 00:24.656
What am I gonna do?
Who I'm gonna talk to?

00:24.777 --> 00:26.119
I'm just gonna take
you to your door.

00:26.233 --> 00:27.167
Why is that?

00:27.281 --> 00:29.744
Because that's as far as
I can go right now.

01:08.599 --> 01:10.330
I'm interested in today.
That was Friday.

01:10.397 --> 01:14.200
Look, I'll clear lunch
plus one hour

01:14.268 --> 01:16.503
And we'll grab a sandwich
and discuss this face to face.

01:16.570 --> 01:18.872
I'm hanging up.

01:35.422 --> 01:37.524
Is it broken?

01:39.326 --> 01:41.060
The lamp?

01:44.398 --> 01:45.498
What are you doing
all the way over there?

01:45.566 --> 01:47.033
It's too hot.

01:47.101 --> 01:49.569
Would you settle for a leg?

01:49.637 --> 01:51.171
I'd be grateful.

01:53.340 --> 01:55.308
It's cold

01:55.376 --> 01:57.343
And soft.

01:57.411 --> 01:59.312
I'm the softest.

02:13.627 --> 02:15.695
So which one of us
is gonna look at the clock first?

02:19.900 --> 02:21.601
I caught it when I was
picking up the lamp.

02:21.669 --> 02:23.469
I'm already late.

02:23.537 --> 02:25.471
For what?

02:25.539 --> 02:27.440
Secor laxatives.

02:29.610 --> 02:31.578
Did I spoil the mood?

02:31.645 --> 02:33.680
What do you have to do?

02:33.747 --> 02:37.283
I have a 4:00
at Erwin Wasey.

02:37.351 --> 02:39.385
Doing what?

02:39.453 --> 02:41.321
I can't tell you that,
Mr. Bond.

02:41.388 --> 02:43.790
I told you.

02:43.857 --> 02:46.226
What are you working on
over there?

02:46.293 --> 02:47.961
I don't tell 'em
what I'm doing for you.

02:50.297 --> 02:52.165
You're not lying in bed with them
right now either.

02:54.101 --> 02:55.568
Do you know what
a Chinese wall is?

02:59.707 --> 03:01.140
I really should go.

03:04.545 --> 03:06.079
Can I get in
the bathroom first?

03:06.146 --> 03:08.214
Just take your time.

03:13.988 --> 03:16.055
Let yourself out.

03:16.123 --> 03:19.525
Lock the door behind you
as a courtesy.

03:19.593 --> 03:21.761
You wanna leave me here?

03:22.930 --> 03:23.997
You sure?

03:25.866 --> 03:28.101
I'm taking everything
interesting with me.

03:36.777 --> 03:38.244
I don't understand.
Do you honestly think

03:38.312 --> 03:39.512
My book isn't better
than Ogilvy's?

03:39.580 --> 03:41.180
Mine's got a story.

03:41.248 --> 03:44.117
It's got mystery,
intrigue, romance.

03:44.184 --> 03:45.818
I tell you It's got examples

03:45.886 --> 03:47.720
<i>- Of how to sell things.</i>

03:47.788 --> 03:49.589
Hold on.

03:51.191 --> 03:52.859
I'm on the phone.

03:52.926 --> 03:54.761
<i>It's Mrs. Sterling.</i>

03:54.828 --> 03:56.663
<i>She's leaving
for the weekend.</i>

03:56.730 --> 04:00.300
It's only Wednesday.
They have phones in Southampton.

04:00.367 --> 04:03.069
Ira, I don't want to sound ungrateful.
I just think...

04:03.137 --> 04:05.605
Hello?
Hello?

04:05.673 --> 04:07.674
Shit.

04:09.576 --> 04:11.411
Come in.

04:13.280 --> 04:15.448
These need signatures,
not initials.

04:15.516 --> 04:18.418
<i>Caroline said
you refused?</i>

04:18.485 --> 04:19.952
It's just so much more work.

04:23.023 --> 04:24.857
I was just giving her
a hard time.

04:24.925 --> 04:28.061
Can I interest you in the same?

04:28.128 --> 04:30.563
<i>And I'm supposed
to tell you in person</i>

04:30.631 --> 04:31.931
That Mr. Pryce
will be taking off

04:31.999 --> 04:33.933
The last two weeks
of August for his son's visit.

04:34.001 --> 04:36.002
You had to tell me that
in person?

04:36.070 --> 04:39.339
- So depressing.
- He doesn't want a memo circulating.

04:39.406 --> 04:41.240
He's afraid people
will stop working.

04:41.308 --> 04:43.543
What are you doing in August?

04:43.610 --> 04:45.478
I'm not sure.

04:45.546 --> 04:48.448
Well, what are you doing
this afternoon?

04:48.515 --> 04:51.351
The same thing I do
every afternoon... working...

04:51.418 --> 04:53.820
Which is what I'm trying
to do right now.

04:53.887 --> 04:55.388
It's not cute.

04:56.924 --> 04:58.591
Joanie.

04:58.659 --> 05:00.560
Jesus.
I'm sorry.

05:00.627 --> 05:02.995
What did you say to her?

05:03.063 --> 05:04.397
What does that have
to do with you?

05:06.066 --> 05:08.101
Her husband got called up.

05:08.168 --> 05:10.136
He's going to Vietnam
right after basic.

05:10.204 --> 05:12.171
Vietnam.

05:12.239 --> 05:14.407
That's not good.

05:14.475 --> 05:17.110
It's okay.
We've all been
walking on eggshells.

05:23.183 --> 05:24.784
Good afternoon, all.

05:24.852 --> 05:26.786
I know you don't like
to be bombarded

05:26.854 --> 05:28.354
The moment you walk in,
but Fillmore and secor

05:28.422 --> 05:29.822
Are both coming in tomorrow.

05:29.890 --> 05:31.290
I can't move forward
with either until you sign off

05:31.358 --> 05:32.992
On what I worked
through lunch to finish.

05:33.060 --> 05:35.795
I'm sorry. I had a long lunch,
went for a swim.

05:35.863 --> 05:37.630
Come back in an hour.
I'm taking a nap.

05:42.069 --> 05:44.670
It's a business of sadists
and masochists,

05:44.738 --> 05:46.472
And you know which one you are.

05:51.712 --> 05:54.414
- Oh hi.
- Peggy, your
boyfriend's here.

05:54.481 --> 05:57.350
Satisfaction guaranteed.

05:57.418 --> 05:59.285
- Why are you here?
- Thought we could get a drink,

05:59.353 --> 06:00.787
- Shoot the bull.
- Sure.

06:00.854 --> 06:02.822
- What time? Where?
- ♪ when you're alone ♪

06:02.890 --> 06:05.057
♪ and life
is making you lonely ♪

06:05.125 --> 06:08.428
- ♪ you can always go... ♪
- 7:00, p.J. Clarke's.

06:08.495 --> 06:10.363
♪ midtown ♪

06:10.431 --> 06:12.331
I'll meet you in the lobby.

06:12.399 --> 06:14.667
Ooh, down below.

06:14.735 --> 06:16.369
Give it a break, jughead.

06:18.238 --> 06:20.840
Oh, I'm not shocked
by your lesbian hijinks.

06:20.908 --> 06:23.309
I just hope you know
you can never do

06:23.377 --> 06:25.077
What a man can do.

06:25.145 --> 06:27.880
That's true.

06:34.922 --> 06:37.890
Bad news. Don showed up.
We're on at 4:00.

06:42.863 --> 06:45.364
<i>How was your siesta?
Are you refreshed?</i>

06:45.432 --> 06:48.534
- Yes.
- Dr. Miller
returned your call.

06:48.602 --> 06:50.069
She said not to wake you

06:50.137 --> 06:51.904
And you needn't return.

06:51.972 --> 06:54.407
But she got the message
and you're gonna have to wait.

06:57.277 --> 06:59.679
- Thank you.
- Are you going to the toilet?

07:02.082 --> 07:03.716
<i>- I have to hire
more copywriters,</i>

07:03.784 --> 07:05.618
But these men come in
and I know

07:05.686 --> 07:07.954
The better they are,
the more my job is in danger.

07:08.021 --> 07:10.756
Oh my.

07:12.426 --> 07:15.628
Look who's here... Abe.

07:15.696 --> 07:19.031
Peggy, I don't know if you remember 
Abe Drexler from Kellogg's loft party.

07:19.099 --> 07:21.834
- Hi, I'm Peggy.
- I remember.

07:21.902 --> 07:24.403
Abe, you want to
join us for a drink?

07:24.471 --> 07:26.639
Yes, please do.

07:26.707 --> 07:28.307
Oh, stay.
I'll just stand here.

07:28.375 --> 07:31.344
Can I get a Johnny Walker
with ice?

07:31.411 --> 07:33.813
Ah, he didn't hear me.

07:36.049 --> 07:37.550
You know what?
I'm gonna go play darts.

07:37.618 --> 07:39.452
- Take my seat.
- Are you sure?

07:39.520 --> 07:42.088
Pay for that.
See you kids later.

07:47.361 --> 07:49.529
I'm sorry.
She's...

07:49.596 --> 07:51.564
Always so damn
self-amused.

07:51.632 --> 07:53.933
What are you talking about?

07:54.001 --> 07:57.537
I was gonna stop by your office, 
but I didn't want to get you in trouble.

07:57.604 --> 08:00.373
Then I thought about finding out where 
you live, but that's weird.

08:00.440 --> 08:02.875
So anyway

08:02.943 --> 08:06.345
- It's nice running into you.
- I don't know what to say.

08:06.413 --> 08:09.282
That's very flattering.

08:09.349 --> 08:11.183
Well, that's how I meant it.

08:15.422 --> 08:17.456
Johnny Walker.
Rocks.

08:17.524 --> 08:19.725
The bartender here
listens to me.

08:33.073 --> 08:36.409
- May I help you?
- Are you Joan Harris?

08:36.476 --> 08:40.046
- I am.
- We're from madam Inga's.

08:40.113 --> 08:44.049
You are to receive massage,
manicure and pedicure.

08:44.116 --> 08:47.687
- Can we?
- I didn't order this.

08:47.754 --> 08:50.823
It's a gift from a friend,
tip included.

08:50.891 --> 08:54.694
- What friend?
- I'm not allowed to say this.

09:03.537 --> 09:05.972
In Greece right now?
Make no mistake,

09:06.039 --> 09:08.608
That's a revolution.
We are a hair away

09:08.675 --> 09:11.644
From everything falling apart
in every society. It's so tenuous.

09:11.712 --> 09:14.146
All these corporations just throw 
their money at everyone

09:14.214 --> 09:16.549
To keep the status quo intact
'cause the people outnumber them.

09:16.617 --> 09:20.519
But in the blink of an eye, they could
overturn everything.

09:20.587 --> 09:23.122
It's an illusion
that America's so organized

09:23.190 --> 09:24.624
That it could never happen
over here.

09:28.962 --> 09:31.297
- Are you from Brooklyn?
- I am.

09:31.365 --> 09:33.199
- Me too.
- I don't hear it.

09:33.266 --> 09:35.201
One more drink
and it'll come out.

09:36.436 --> 09:37.970
Okay.

09:39.973 --> 09:42.675
What am I talking to you
about corporations for?

09:42.743 --> 09:45.511
- You must deal with them all the time.
- I guess.

09:45.579 --> 09:47.847
Vick chemical,
American tobacco,

09:47.914 --> 09:49.949
But most of them
are family businesses...

09:50.017 --> 09:52.518
Samsonite, Fillmore auto parts,

09:52.586 --> 09:55.321
- Sugarberry...
- Fillmore auto parts is worse than a corporation,

09:55.389 --> 09:57.356
- What with the boycott and all.
- What boycott?

09:57.424 --> 09:59.592
The Southern stores
won't hire Negroes.

09:59.660 --> 10:01.894
Says who?

10:01.962 --> 10:04.130
It was in "the voice."
it was in a couple of places.

10:04.197 --> 10:06.932
I don't think that's true.
I would've heard that.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.701
It is true.

10:08.769 --> 10:11.404
That doesn't seem like them.

10:11.471 --> 10:14.707
I'm sure they're perfectly nice
for racists, you know,

10:14.775 --> 10:18.110
And obviously your company has 
an investment in looking the other way.

10:20.047 --> 10:22.515
Well, it's a complicated idea,

10:22.582 --> 10:24.750
But in advertising,

10:24.818 --> 10:26.452
We don't really judge people.

10:26.520 --> 10:28.387
We try and help them
out of these situations.

10:28.455 --> 10:30.856
Certainly we would try
and stop this.

10:30.924 --> 10:32.925
If it's true, it's not good
for their business.

10:32.993 --> 10:35.795
Jesus, I don't even know
where to start.

10:35.862 --> 10:37.830
You would've done
a campaign for Goldwater?

10:37.898 --> 10:40.232
You kidding?
That would've been spectacular.

10:40.300 --> 10:43.235
- Did you vote for him?
- Of course not.

10:43.303 --> 10:45.337
Wha... civil rights
isn't a situation

10:45.405 --> 10:47.907
To be fixed
with some ##p.R. Campaign.

10:47.974 --> 10:50.576
It's an inequality that the world has
its eyes on.

10:50.644 --> 10:52.344
I know.

10:54.548 --> 10:56.582
But I have to say

10:56.650 --> 10:58.651
Most of the things
Negroes can't do

10:58.719 --> 11:00.486
I can't do either

11:00.554 --> 11:02.455
And nobody seems to care.

11:02.522 --> 11:04.390
What are you talking about?

11:04.458 --> 11:06.692
Half of the meetings
take place over golf, tennis,

11:06.760 --> 11:09.829
In a bunch of clubs where I'm not
allowed to be a member

11:09.896 --> 11:11.731
Or even enter.

11:11.798 --> 11:14.667
The university club said
the only way I could eat dinner there

11:14.735 --> 11:15.835
Was if I arrived in a cake.

11:15.902 --> 11:18.904
There's no Negro
copywriters, you know.

11:18.972 --> 11:21.440
I'm sure they could
fight their way in like I did.

11:21.508 --> 11:24.043
Believe me,
nobody wanted me there.

11:25.178 --> 11:26.779
All right, Peggy.

11:26.847 --> 11:28.314
We'll have a civil rights
March for women.

11:34.321 --> 11:36.021
I have a really early day.

11:36.089 --> 11:37.389
It was nice to see you.

11:37.457 --> 11:39.625
Wait. Hey hey hey.
I'm just saying

11:39.693 --> 11:41.927
They're not shooting women
to keep 'em from voting. That's all.

11:43.530 --> 11:45.664
Oh, Jesus.
I'm really sorry.

11:45.732 --> 11:47.867
I'm much better on paper.

11:47.934 --> 11:51.470
You're opinionated
and you're criticizing me.

11:51.538 --> 11:53.305
That's not what I'm doing.
This is discourse.

11:53.373 --> 11:55.975
I knew I shouldn't
have let Joyce leave.

11:56.042 --> 11:57.977
Have a good night.

12:06.039 --> 12:09.375
A three-letter word
for a flightless bird.

12:09.443 --> 12:11.010
Emu.

12:11.078 --> 12:12.778
Nope. It starts
with an "l."

12:12.846 --> 12:14.547
The hell it does.

12:15.816 --> 12:17.917
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

12:17.985 --> 12:19.885
Could I get some coffee? And let me 
know when Dr. Miller arrives.

12:19.953 --> 12:22.588
It's hard... the way
she breezes past me.

12:28.395 --> 12:30.629
She's pushy, that one.

12:30.697 --> 12:32.698
I guess that's what it takes.

12:35.502 --> 12:37.403
- Morning.
- Good morning.

12:37.471 --> 12:39.839
- And thank you.
- For what?

12:39.906 --> 12:41.674
That was very thoughtful.

12:41.742 --> 12:44.844
I knew I was rubbing you
the wrong way,

12:44.911 --> 12:48.214
So I thought, why not have someone
rub you the right way?

12:48.281 --> 12:51.283
- I brought you bear claws.
- Caroline won't let me have one

12:51.351 --> 12:53.252
Unless it's on the end
of a real bear.

12:54.821 --> 12:56.522
- Well, anyway.
- Joanie.

12:58.325 --> 13:01.193
- It'll be okay.
- People love to say that.

13:01.261 --> 13:03.996
Look, I know you're
having a tough run.

13:05.365 --> 13:07.600
Let me get you a meal, Hmm?

13:07.667 --> 13:09.201
Take your mind off things?

13:09.269 --> 13:11.404
Of course.

13:13.407 --> 13:15.941
I forgot for a second that you're incapable
of doing something nice

13:16.009 --> 13:17.877
Without expecting
something nicer in return.

13:17.944 --> 13:19.712
I didn't mean anything by it.

13:19.780 --> 13:21.414
Honest.

13:21.481 --> 13:23.115
Just thought you
could use a night out.

13:23.183 --> 13:25.785
- Thank you.
I'm fine.
- Good.

13:35.328 --> 13:37.329
- What are you doing here?
- I wrote something.

13:37.397 --> 13:39.231
I kind of wrote it for you.

13:40.834 --> 13:42.601
I would love it if you read it.

13:45.205 --> 13:46.906
"Nuremberg on Madison avenue"?

13:49.176 --> 13:51.911
- What is this?
- It's what I was
trying to say last night,

13:51.978 --> 13:54.380
But without, I don't know,
my abrasive tone.

13:54.448 --> 13:56.749
- Read it.
- Right now in front of you?

13:56.817 --> 13:59.118
Nah. Take your time.
I'll wait over here.

13:59.186 --> 14:01.620
I have a lot to do.

14:01.688 --> 14:03.989
I came all the way up here.
I want to know what you think, okay?

14:11.298 --> 14:13.365
These domesticated suburbanites

14:13.433 --> 14:15.868
Still have a primitive desire
to get their hands dirty,

14:15.936 --> 14:19.405
But have they have become
so removed from nature that they can't.

14:19.473 --> 14:21.373
They don't know how to hunt 
or swing a hammer

14:21.441 --> 14:23.709
- Or fix their cars.
- You mean like these two.

14:25.312 --> 14:26.912
Actually, no.
I'm from Vermont

14:26.980 --> 14:29.982
And Don's a competitive
fly fisherman.

14:30.050 --> 14:33.185
What our findings show
is that this demographic

14:33.253 --> 14:35.321
Will spend
a good amount of money

14:35.388 --> 14:37.289
For the satisfaction
of being useful with their hands.

14:37.357 --> 14:40.659
Ladies love a man
who's good with his hands.

14:42.329 --> 14:44.096
You think a mechanic
comes in and sees these jokers

14:44.164 --> 14:45.798
Looking at fan belts,
he's gonna stick around?

14:47.200 --> 14:50.102
- No offense.
- What's the difference?

14:50.170 --> 14:51.470
Our inventory's the same.

14:51.538 --> 14:53.772
I think if they see
a coat and tie on aisle 4,

14:53.840 --> 14:56.342
They'll think our prices went up.
I know I would.

14:56.409 --> 14:59.745
Listen, salt of the earth, we need more
than mechanics to survive.

14:59.813 --> 15:01.747
<i>You ever hear of sears?
They'll kill us.</i>

15:01.815 --> 15:03.582
We agreed we all had to agree.

15:03.650 --> 15:05.618
Don't we have enough problems
with the boycott?

15:07.187 --> 15:08.854
Look, I don't want
to get involved

15:08.922 --> 15:10.990
In a family squabble,
but I can't move forward

15:11.057 --> 15:12.491
Until you agree on a strategy.

15:14.628 --> 15:16.395
What if there were a way
to market to both groups?

15:16.463 --> 15:18.464
"Fillmore auto parts.

15:18.532 --> 15:21.367
Where the pros go
and everyone's welcome."

15:21.434 --> 15:24.670
- It's a little corny.
- It's great and you know it.

15:24.738 --> 15:27.206
That's not a strategy.
That's two strategies

15:27.274 --> 15:28.474
Connected by
the word "and."

15:28.542 --> 15:30.509
I can do "where the pros go"

15:30.577 --> 15:32.545
Or I can do
"everyone's welcome,"

15:32.612 --> 15:34.880
- But not both.
- Sure you can.

15:41.555 --> 15:43.422
Someone has to make a decision.
There are three of you.

15:43.490 --> 15:45.858
Vote.

15:45.926 --> 15:47.159
Sean, what do you think?

15:47.227 --> 15:50.162
I d-d-d-d...

15:50.230 --> 15:53.832
D-d-d-don't know.

15:53.900 --> 15:55.367
<i>What?</i>

15:55.435 --> 15:57.336
You'll have to excuse me
for a moment.

15:57.404 --> 15:59.238
Continue, please.

16:03.643 --> 16:06.345
Why d-d-do we

16:06.413 --> 16:08.080
Have to c-c-convince him?

16:10.850 --> 16:12.017
What are you doing here?

16:14.554 --> 16:16.722
I wanted to see you.

16:16.790 --> 16:19.091
I am so sorry.
Who are you?

16:19.159 --> 16:21.660
My name is Vivian winters

16:21.728 --> 16:23.696
And I'm going to assume
you're her father

16:23.763 --> 16:25.264
Since that's what
she's led me to believe.

16:25.332 --> 16:27.266
Don. What exactly
is going on?

16:27.334 --> 16:29.602
I found her on the train
between carriages

16:29.669 --> 16:31.637
Trying to avoid the conductor.

16:31.705 --> 16:33.772
I didn't have enough money.

16:33.840 --> 16:37.109
Megan, could you take her
to my office?

16:38.278 --> 16:39.411
Go.

16:44.217 --> 16:46.318
Thank you.

16:46.386 --> 16:48.087
Can I pay you for the ticket
and your time?

16:48.154 --> 16:50.055
You're just very lucky
I ran into her

16:50.123 --> 16:51.890
Before someone else did.

16:51.958 --> 16:54.827
The types on that train?
Someone should keep track of her.

16:54.894 --> 16:57.196
You're right.
I didn't know.

16:57.264 --> 17:00.032
Men never know what's going on.

17:00.100 --> 17:03.235
- I offered you money
and I said thank you.

17:10.377 --> 17:12.444
She looks so chubby
in the pictures.

17:12.512 --> 17:14.113
Get her mother
on the phone now.

17:20.086 --> 17:21.753
What do you think you're doing?

17:21.820 --> 17:25.089
I wanted to see you and I didn't want to
wait two weekends.

17:25.157 --> 17:29.161
Well, you can't do this.
This is very serious.

17:29.229 --> 17:31.230
<i>Mrs. Francis
on the line.</i>

17:34.434 --> 17:37.636
- Guess who's sitting on my couch right now.
- What are you talking about?

17:37.704 --> 17:40.606
I'm talking about a stranger
bringing Sally to my office

17:40.674 --> 17:43.108
- Because she got onthe train with no money.
- You're kidding.

17:43.176 --> 17:45.210
Carla was supposed to pick her up
after the doctor.

17:45.278 --> 17:48.280
- How the hell did this happen?
- Dr. Keener thought it would be good for her

17:48.348 --> 17:50.316
To walk from camp to her
appointment by herself.

17:50.383 --> 17:52.851
Great idea.
Thank you, psychiatry.

17:52.919 --> 17:55.554
Don't yell at me. She needs to learn
responsibility.

17:55.622 --> 17:57.756
<i>You need to learn
responsibility.</i>

17:57.824 --> 17:59.692
Now come get her.
I've got a business to run here.

17:59.759 --> 18:02.695
Because it's so easy.
It's so much fun to take care of her.

18:02.762 --> 18:04.296
Enjoy.

18:04.364 --> 18:06.365
- What?
- Enjoy, don.

18:06.433 --> 18:08.901
I'm meeting Henry in the city tomorrow night.
I'll get her then.

18:14.908 --> 18:17.009
Don't move
and don't touch anything.

18:20.213 --> 18:22.247
I don't want to hear it. Just make sure 
she doesn't leave that room.

18:34.211 --> 18:36.880
- Hey.
Are you serious with this?

18:42.353 --> 18:44.688
Everyone knows who represents
Fillmore auto parts.

18:44.755 --> 18:47.324
- We're the agency of record.
- But I was defending you.

18:47.391 --> 18:49.392
We have a religion
in this country

18:49.460 --> 18:51.261
And it's business.
You're not a priest.

18:51.329 --> 18:52.362
You're just another congregant.

18:52.430 --> 18:54.230
So I'm not a war criminal.

18:54.298 --> 18:57.133
Look, why should someone nice
like you have to do this?

18:57.201 --> 18:58.868
Why should you be a part
of that corruption?

18:58.936 --> 19:01.438
It's a waste of your
and a million other artists' gifts.

19:01.505 --> 19:03.740
If you publish this,
I'll lose my job.

19:03.808 --> 19:05.141
Maybe you're better than this.

19:07.178 --> 19:08.578
I'm not a political person.

19:08.646 --> 19:10.447
I don't have to defend myself.

19:12.249 --> 19:14.317
You're political whether
you like it or not.

19:14.385 --> 19:17.187
And you're not supposed
to be insulted.

19:17.254 --> 19:19.489
- You're supposed to be flattered.
- Are you crazy?

19:19.557 --> 19:23.026
You inspired me.
I wrote this for you.

19:23.094 --> 19:25.161
I guess I read you wrong.

19:27.064 --> 19:29.466
You look so earnest.

19:29.533 --> 19:31.768
I need your word that
you'll destroy that.

19:31.836 --> 19:34.004
Sure.

19:34.071 --> 19:36.172
I won't bother you again.

19:46.317 --> 19:47.651
Miss Blankenship.

19:53.057 --> 19:55.158
Miss Blankenship,
are you all right?

19:58.262 --> 19:59.963
Miss Blankenship.

20:01.599 --> 20:03.099
Miss Blankenship.

20:05.703 --> 20:08.371
Caroline.
Oh God. Caroline!

20:13.377 --> 20:15.779
- Oh. Do not come out of there.
- I know!

20:18.749 --> 20:22.552
- What now?
- Excuse me, Mr. Draper.

20:22.620 --> 20:25.021
- I'm really sorry
to bother you again.

20:27.992 --> 20:29.893
- are you sure?

20:29.960 --> 20:32.062
- I'm afraid so.
- What happened?

20:38.469 --> 20:39.836
Jesus.

20:41.372 --> 20:43.006
Poor thing.

20:43.074 --> 20:45.041
Should we call an ambulance?

20:46.977 --> 20:49.012
The coroner.

20:50.214 --> 20:51.481
What about them?

20:53.350 --> 20:56.786
- I'll attend to this.
- Sally's in there.

20:56.854 --> 20:59.456
- Why?
- She's visiting.

21:09.200 --> 21:11.401
Megan, get a man,
and we'll need a blanket.

21:12.937 --> 21:14.537
There's an afghan
on Mr. Crane's couch.

21:17.608 --> 21:19.542
She seemed fine
just a minute ago.

21:28.686 --> 21:32.422
So where are we?

21:32.490 --> 21:36.059
- Have we agreed on a strategy?
- I'm not sure.

21:36.127 --> 21:38.495
<i>This is where we are.</i>

21:38.562 --> 21:41.131
<i>Correct me
if I'm wrong, gentlemen,</i>

21:41.198 --> 21:44.367
But we believe by holding onto
Fillmore's reputation

21:44.435 --> 21:46.803
As a place
for professional mechanics,

21:46.871 --> 21:49.672
<i>We can actually attract
men of all types.</i>

21:49.740 --> 21:52.008
So it's something like

21:52.076 --> 21:54.778
"Fillmore auto parts.

21:54.845 --> 21:56.846
For the mechanic
in every man."

21:56.914 --> 21:59.482
And although it seems
immaterial to you,

21:59.550 --> 22:03.153
- The Fillmore brothers like it.
- Unanimously.

22:06.657 --> 22:07.924
What was that again?

22:09.226 --> 22:11.194
Fillmore auto parts.

22:11.262 --> 22:12.929
"For the mechanic
in every man."

22:28.212 --> 22:29.813
My mother made that.

22:34.084 --> 22:36.286
Can we get your signature?

22:36.353 --> 22:38.087
I'm the president.

22:52.603 --> 22:54.637
I think this is a winner.

22:54.705 --> 22:57.540
Gentlemen, always a pleasure.

22:58.742 --> 23:00.376
Ken, can you show them out?

23:00.444 --> 23:01.644
Of course.
This way.

23:11.388 --> 23:13.556
My goodness.
I was just talking to her.

23:15.726 --> 23:18.895
Listen, my daughter
is sitting in my office.

23:18.963 --> 23:21.497
- What?
- She decided
to run away today.

23:21.565 --> 23:23.566
- Sally?
- I'd really appreciate it

23:23.634 --> 23:26.069
If you could go in my bag, get my keys,
take her to my apartment

23:26.136 --> 23:27.804
And just...
Sit with her.

23:27.872 --> 23:29.505
Are you sure?

23:29.573 --> 23:32.108
I would have my secretary do it,
but she's dead.

23:32.176 --> 23:34.110
No, of course.

23:34.178 --> 23:36.679
Okay, do you want
to introduce me?

23:36.747 --> 23:38.681
I mean, what do I say to her?

23:38.749 --> 23:40.683
Do we really have to have
this discussion right now?

23:40.751 --> 23:41.885
You're Faye.

23:44.355 --> 23:46.823
Find Cooper and Roger at lunch

23:46.891 --> 23:48.825
And stop them from bringing
secor back here.

23:51.896 --> 23:53.496
Sally, this is my friend Faye.

23:53.564 --> 23:55.331
She's going to take you
to my apartment.

23:55.399 --> 23:57.901
- Why? - You don't want this
to get worse, believe me.

24:05.676 --> 24:08.611
Hello.
My name is Faye.

24:08.679 --> 24:11.714
I know.
My dad just said that.

24:22.393 --> 24:23.993
Stop.

24:24.061 --> 24:26.763
- Where are they taking her?
- She's going to the morgue.

24:26.830 --> 24:28.865
No, she's not.
She's going to Frank E. Campbell.

24:35.472 --> 24:38.041
Anyone track down her family?

24:38.108 --> 24:40.810
She has a niece.
I'll call her.

24:40.878 --> 24:42.645
I'm sorry, Bert.

24:50.521 --> 24:52.188
Roger.

24:57.895 --> 24:59.662
You should go home.

25:03.634 --> 25:05.768
Yes. Take all
my calls up here.

25:05.836 --> 25:07.070
Okay.

25:10.074 --> 25:12.608
<i>So Fitzgerald says,
"I promised to pour</i>

25:12.676 --> 25:14.444
<i>This whiskey over
your grave earlier, but do you mind</i>

25:14.511 --> 25:17.246
"- If I pass it through
me kidneys first?"

25:24.421 --> 25:26.522
- Are you all right?
- Oh, damn it,

25:26.590 --> 25:28.057
I don't want to die
in this office.

25:28.125 --> 25:30.293
I almost have twice.

25:30.361 --> 25:32.161
Stop it.

25:32.229 --> 25:33.997
If it looks like I'm going,
open a window.

25:34.064 --> 25:35.732
I'd rather flatten
the top of a cab.

25:38.035 --> 25:39.936
You are not going
to die in this office.

25:43.340 --> 25:45.041
Poor Ida.

25:45.109 --> 25:47.076
She died like she lived...

25:47.144 --> 25:49.612
Surrounded by the people
she answered phones for.

25:54.485 --> 25:56.786
I'm gonna go to
my favorite restaurant

25:56.854 --> 25:58.321
And have a glass of cyanide.

26:00.557 --> 26:02.225
Or you could join me.

26:02.292 --> 26:04.894
I don't know.

26:04.962 --> 26:08.898
- I'm gonna kill myself, Joanie.
- No, you're not.

26:08.966 --> 26:11.434
Go get your things.
I'll meet you in the lobby.

26:15.372 --> 26:16.639
I got it.

26:22.980 --> 26:25.515
- Hello, daddy.
- Don't "hello, daddy" me.

26:25.582 --> 26:26.916
Go sit down.

26:31.722 --> 26:34.023
- How was it?
- Great.

26:34.091 --> 26:37.393
We watched a little TV,
one of us took a nap.

26:37.461 --> 26:40.530
You want to stay?
You're gonna need to eat.

26:40.597 --> 26:43.066
I know,
but I have dinner plans.

26:50.007 --> 26:51.774
Thank you.

26:51.842 --> 26:54.177
Glad I could help.

26:54.244 --> 26:56.913
- Good night, Sally.
- Good night.

27:06.657 --> 27:08.558
Can we order a pizza?

27:11.028 --> 27:14.464
<i>I want you to promise me you're never
going to do this again.</i>

27:15.699 --> 27:17.233
I promise.

27:28.411 --> 27:29.745
Why did you always
pick this place?

27:29.812 --> 27:32.047
No chance of running
into anyone

27:32.115 --> 27:34.783
And, of course,
cherry cheesecake.

27:34.851 --> 27:37.819
Well, the clientèle
is older than I remember.

27:37.887 --> 27:39.688
But not us.

27:44.761 --> 27:46.595
I wish you would talk
to me about things.

27:47.897 --> 27:49.931
My husband doesn't like it.

27:49.999 --> 27:51.967
I know it's tough,

27:52.035 --> 27:55.203
But he must've known about the
possibilities when he signed up.

27:56.372 --> 27:57.806
I wasn't consulted.

27:57.874 --> 27:59.274
You're kidding.

28:01.177 --> 28:04.012
Because you always tell Jane about all
of your decisions?

28:04.080 --> 28:06.248
She's the woman behind
the man, isn't she?

28:08.985 --> 28:10.919
Did you listen to my memoirs?

28:10.987 --> 28:13.221
I just have them transcribed

28:13.289 --> 28:15.457
And recycle the tapes.

28:15.525 --> 28:17.859
And you're not a little curious if there's
a chapter called "Joan"?

28:17.927 --> 28:20.062
There'd better not be.

28:21.631 --> 28:24.866
I know.
That's the problem.

28:24.934 --> 28:26.601
And every time I think back,

28:26.669 --> 28:27.903
All the good stuff
was with you.

28:30.106 --> 28:33.809
And I'm sorry
I keep pestering you.

28:33.876 --> 28:36.111
I just can't help myself.

28:37.480 --> 28:38.880
I don't expect
anything to happen.

28:38.948 --> 28:41.183
I appreciate that.

28:51.194 --> 28:53.195
Can I ask you something?

28:53.262 --> 28:55.731
Yes, I'm still mad at you.

28:55.798 --> 28:57.699
Are you going to marry Faye?

28:59.001 --> 29:01.203
What? No.

29:02.405 --> 29:04.039
Is she your girlfriend?

29:04.107 --> 29:07.442
- No.
- She had your keys.

29:08.945 --> 29:10.712
I gave her my keys.

29:12.982 --> 29:14.950
She knew you had peanut butter.

29:17.487 --> 29:19.121
Everyone has peanut butter.

29:20.556 --> 29:22.691
Well, she said
she wanted to meet me.

29:22.759 --> 29:24.459
Why would she want to meet me?

29:29.832 --> 29:32.200
Look, I do like her,

29:32.268 --> 29:34.736
But we just work together
and I talk about you a lot.

29:36.139 --> 29:37.939
Do you like her?

29:38.007 --> 29:40.675
- She seems nice.
- Well, good.

29:40.743 --> 29:42.878
Maybe you'll get
to see her again sometime.

29:55.792 --> 29:58.193
Get out some plates.

29:58.261 --> 30:01.530
'cause I didn't want to take a cab on Broadway.
It's a beautiful night.

30:01.597 --> 30:03.799
I don't like
this neighborhood anymore.

30:03.866 --> 30:05.367
What happened to it?

30:05.434 --> 30:07.402
Miss Blankenship,
you're not missing anything.

30:07.470 --> 30:09.938
- Do you know
what time it is?
- I do.

30:10.006 --> 30:11.273
Oh God.

30:11.340 --> 30:12.908
You know what to do.

30:12.975 --> 30:16.178
- Rog...
- yes. Yes, we do.

30:16.245 --> 30:18.914
Look down.
Everything's going to be fine.

30:29.826 --> 30:31.560
- There you go.
- What about her?

30:32.762 --> 30:34.262
Give me your bag.

30:36.065 --> 30:37.399
Rings.

30:43.072 --> 30:45.574
That's everything.
We haven't seen anything.

30:50.713 --> 30:52.981
I can't breathe.

30:53.049 --> 30:56.218
- I want to scream.
- Don't. Come over here.

30:58.154 --> 31:01.156
- You have to calm down.
- My ring. My ring.

31:01.224 --> 31:03.024
Stop it.
Everything can be replaced.

31:03.092 --> 31:04.793
You're fine.

31:25.414 --> 31:27.249
Don't stop.

31:37.026 --> 31:39.628
Are you sure you don't want
to call your mother or your brothers?

31:41.063 --> 31:43.865
It's 9:30.
They're asleep.

31:50.706 --> 31:53.675
Daddy, I love you so much.

31:53.743 --> 31:55.744
I love you too.

31:57.580 --> 31:59.514
Did you brush your hair?

31:59.582 --> 32:01.316
I want to live
with you all the time.

32:04.186 --> 32:06.154
You can't do that, honey.

32:06.222 --> 32:08.757
Why not?
I'll be good.

32:10.426 --> 32:12.761
Where are you gonna go
to school down here?

32:12.828 --> 32:14.896
What about your friends?
What about your brothers?

32:17.266 --> 32:20.468
They could live here too.
I'll watch them.

32:20.536 --> 32:21.903
Sally.

32:23.205 --> 32:24.806
Go to sleep.

33:30.873 --> 33:33.742
- Sally?
- I made French toast.

33:35.711 --> 33:37.612
You know I don't like
you using the stove.

33:37.680 --> 33:39.881
Oh, daddy,
I do it all the time.

33:39.949 --> 33:41.549
And there's no shells in it.

33:43.486 --> 33:45.153
Do you want me
to turn on the TV?

33:45.221 --> 33:46.688
We can watch
"the today show."

33:46.756 --> 33:48.456
No.

33:48.524 --> 33:50.125
Where'd you learn
how to do this?

33:50.192 --> 33:51.693
Carla taught me.

33:53.496 --> 33:55.196
What's on this?

33:55.264 --> 33:57.198
Mrs. Butterworth's.

33:57.266 --> 33:58.566
Go get it.

34:05.441 --> 34:08.842
That's rum.
Read labels.

34:08.911 --> 34:10.844
Is it bad?

34:12.181 --> 34:13.514
Not really.

34:16.052 --> 34:18.018
Get dressed and I'll get you
a bun at the office.

34:18.087 --> 34:19.687
Can't we do something?

34:25.860 --> 34:28.463
All right, here's the deal.
No negotiating.

34:28.531 --> 34:30.799
I'm gonna call in,
move everything to noon,

34:30.866 --> 34:32.467
And we're gonna go
to the central park zoo.

34:32.534 --> 34:35.969
- And the dinosaur museum?
- One or the other.

34:36.038 --> 34:38.106
We only have till noon.

34:38.174 --> 34:39.808
You finish your breakfast.

34:39.875 --> 34:41.275
I'm going to get ready.

34:46.916 --> 34:49.384
You want me
to get don to do it?

34:49.452 --> 34:51.719
Of course,
he didn't really know her.

34:53.121 --> 34:54.589
No, he didn't.

34:58.027 --> 34:59.627
Caroline,
get Mrs. Harris.

34:59.695 --> 35:02.397
It's regarding
Ida Blankenship's obit.

35:02.465 --> 35:04.766
That ought to get her in here.

35:04.834 --> 35:07.068
This is an insult to her.

35:07.136 --> 35:09.170
I can't think of anything.

35:09.238 --> 35:12.640
And I have no office
in which to ruminate.

35:16.145 --> 35:18.313
Cooper's trying
to write an obit...

35:18.380 --> 35:20.882
Something sharp and sweet.

35:22.985 --> 35:25.286
Well, Mr. Cooper,

35:25.354 --> 35:27.188
Shall we say,

35:27.256 --> 35:29.591
- "beloved friend..."
- Mmm.

35:29.658 --> 35:31.993
"...Devoted caretaker..."

35:32.061 --> 35:34.496
Put "quietly in her sleep,"
of course.

35:34.563 --> 35:35.763
What's her profession...
secretary?

35:35.831 --> 35:37.765
Executive secretary.

35:39.435 --> 35:42.036
She was born in 1898 in a barn.

35:42.104 --> 35:46.207
She died on the 37th floor
of a skyscraper.

35:46.275 --> 35:48.810
She's an astronaut.

35:52.248 --> 35:53.815
<i>Hey.</i>

35:57.153 --> 35:59.220
Is this what it took
to get you in here?

36:02.224 --> 36:03.658
Look, I'm sorry.

36:05.161 --> 36:07.061
It was in the heat
of the moment.

36:08.631 --> 36:10.932
And there was a moment.
You know that.

36:12.635 --> 36:14.469
I'm not sorry,

36:14.537 --> 36:16.371
But I'm married.

36:17.773 --> 36:19.140
And so are you.

36:19.208 --> 36:21.075
I feel something

36:22.244 --> 36:23.578
And I know you do.

36:35.546 --> 36:37.280
Good afternoon.

36:37.348 --> 36:40.283
- Hello.
- Sally, this is Megan.

36:40.351 --> 36:44.087
- Where's miss Blankenship?
- She went away.

36:44.155 --> 36:45.489
I'm helping out
for a little bit.

36:47.825 --> 36:50.227
Her mother should be by at 5:00. 
Can you handle five minutes?

36:50.294 --> 36:52.162
Are you hungry?

36:52.230 --> 36:54.297
She ate plenty.

36:54.365 --> 36:55.932
I'm gonna get coffee
and check in.

37:02.974 --> 37:05.509
Shit.
Now we can't leave.

37:05.576 --> 37:08.578
Huh. Harry said on the form where
it says "cause of death,"

37:08.646 --> 37:11.715
They wrote "don draper."

37:11.783 --> 37:14.051
How long do you think Yvette Mimieux's
gonna last on his desk?

37:14.118 --> 37:16.186
I say we start a pool

37:16.254 --> 37:18.722
On whether she's fired,
quits or dies.

37:22.593 --> 37:25.429
Where's Dr. Miller?

37:25.496 --> 37:27.764
- I don't know if she's coming in.
- She is.

37:27.832 --> 37:30.534
Well, the Fillmores
want a jingle,

37:30.601 --> 37:32.803
A c-c-c-catchy tune.

37:32.870 --> 37:34.438
<i>- don't do that.</i>

37:36.607 --> 37:39.943
Harry says no rock 'n' roll
if we want middle-class men.

37:40.011 --> 37:42.679
He was pushing Perry Como.

37:42.747 --> 37:44.881
And we had pat Boone,
Roger Miller,

37:44.949 --> 37:47.084
Frankie Laine, Duane eddy.

37:47.151 --> 37:48.652
I'm glad I came in for this.

37:50.354 --> 37:52.155
How about Harry Belafonte?

37:52.223 --> 37:53.890
Everyone likes him.

37:53.958 --> 37:57.227
I'll get you tickets
to Harry Belafonte.

37:57.295 --> 38:00.130
Believe me, he ain't selling
auto parts for these guys.

38:00.198 --> 38:04.067
Well, maybe it'll help them
with their image in the South.

38:04.135 --> 38:07.037
They don't want help.
Have you ever been to the South?

38:07.105 --> 38:08.271
'cause they have a way
of doing things

38:08.339 --> 38:10.407
And it doesn't include
Harry Belafonte.

38:10.475 --> 38:12.375
The Fillmore brothers
are from Boston.

38:12.443 --> 38:14.111
Same thing.

38:14.178 --> 38:15.946
Well, why are we doing business

38:16.013 --> 38:17.581
With someone that
doesn't hire Negroes?

38:22.353 --> 38:25.822
Our job is to make men
like Fillmore auto,

38:25.890 --> 38:28.191
Not make Fillmore auto
like Negroes.

38:34.565 --> 38:37.067
Pick one,
get it written
and recorded

38:37.135 --> 38:39.402
And if they want to change it, we will
charge them to change it.

38:41.072 --> 38:42.839
How about Dean Martin?

38:42.907 --> 38:45.041
He's friends
with Sammy Davis Jr.

38:45.109 --> 38:47.077
Does that work for you, Peggy?

38:51.782 --> 38:54.584
Mrs. Francis is going to be
in the lobby any minute.

38:54.652 --> 38:56.586
I have to cover reception,
per Joan's orders.

38:56.654 --> 38:58.088
Go ahead.

39:02.026 --> 39:03.793
Your mother's going to be
downstairs in a minute.

39:03.861 --> 39:05.395
Get your things.

39:05.463 --> 39:07.030
I wanna stay.

39:07.098 --> 39:08.632
Well, you can't.

39:08.699 --> 39:11.034
I want to stay and I don't know
why I can't.

39:11.102 --> 39:13.103
Because you have to go home.

39:13.171 --> 39:15.772
I'll be good.
I promise.

39:17.208 --> 39:18.975
- Come on.
- No.

39:19.043 --> 39:20.744
- Let's go.
- No! No!

39:20.811 --> 39:23.780
No no! I'm not going
anywhere! Stop it!

39:23.848 --> 39:26.283
- Do you want me to carry you out of here?
- I'm not going.

39:26.350 --> 39:28.318
<i>I'm not leaving.
I hate it there!</i>

39:29.754 --> 39:31.521
Is everything okay?

39:34.892 --> 39:37.127
- Can you talk to her?
- What?

39:37.195 --> 39:38.528
Please. I can't
bring her back

39:38.596 --> 39:40.297
Kicking and screaming
to her mother.

39:40.364 --> 39:42.065
I don't have
much child psychology.

39:42.133 --> 39:44.067
Just talk to her.

39:48.506 --> 39:50.674
Dr. Faye wants
to talk to you.

39:52.743 --> 39:54.744
Hi, Sally.

39:54.812 --> 39:56.513
Remember me from yesterday?

40:01.252 --> 40:04.120
I know
you don't want to go,
but you have to.

40:04.188 --> 40:07.691
- Your mother came all the way out here.
- You don't know my mother.

40:07.758 --> 40:09.292
Sally.

40:11.662 --> 40:13.930
Sally,

40:13.998 --> 40:16.700
Sometimes we have to do things
we don't want to do.

40:16.767 --> 40:19.202
- Shut up.
- What's gotten into you?

40:19.270 --> 40:22.138
- I don't think I'm helping here.
- We don't want your help.

40:22.206 --> 40:26.309
- Let's go, now.
- Stop it! No! Stop it!

40:45.496 --> 40:47.197
It's gonna be all right.

40:47.265 --> 40:49.532
No, it's not.

40:54.505 --> 40:56.206
I fall all the time.

40:59.110 --> 41:01.878
I was coming to get you.

41:01.946 --> 41:04.714
Mrs.... Your...

41:04.782 --> 41:06.583
Sally's mother is in reception.

41:08.352 --> 41:10.253
Thank you.

41:22.199 --> 41:23.733
I was worried about you.

41:35.980 --> 41:37.013
Come on, let's go.

41:37.081 --> 41:38.648
I was waiting
in the lobby at 5:00.

41:38.716 --> 41:41.685
- We lost track of time.
- Well, now I'm late.

41:44.155 --> 41:46.056
Sally?

41:46.123 --> 41:49.259
- Say goodbye to your father.
- Goodbye.

41:52.663 --> 41:54.064
Excuse me.

41:57.435 --> 41:59.069
Thank you.

42:09.914 --> 42:13.216
Hi. Are you here
to see Peggy?

42:21.792 --> 42:23.593
Can you make me one of those?

42:24.929 --> 42:27.597
No. No, I can't.

42:29.667 --> 42:32.736
- I can't do anything for you.
- Why are you upset?

42:32.803 --> 42:34.471
You shouldn't have
put me in that position.

42:35.906 --> 42:37.741
Things happen.
I didn't plan it.

42:37.808 --> 42:39.342
You asked me to go watch her.

42:39.410 --> 42:41.211
There was no one else to do it.

42:41.278 --> 42:44.013
And just now?
What the hell was that?

42:44.081 --> 42:46.383
I'm not good with kids.

42:46.450 --> 42:48.585
That was not your fault.

42:48.652 --> 42:51.121
<i>Well, it feels like there was a test
and I failed it.</i>

42:54.225 --> 42:55.859
God knows I'd be lying

42:55.926 --> 42:57.594
If I said

42:57.661 --> 43:00.230
Would I meet your children?
When would I meet your children?

43:00.297 --> 43:02.532
But I don't have any.

43:14.111 --> 43:15.812
I'm sorry.

43:15.880 --> 43:19.516
I love children, but I chose to be
where I am.

43:21.385 --> 43:23.253
I don't view it as a failure.

43:23.320 --> 43:25.088
It doesn't matter.

43:28.225 --> 43:30.193
I mean it.

43:36.967 --> 43:39.102
Jesus.
What a mess.

43:42.406 --> 43:44.240
Part of it's good, right?

43:48.145 --> 43:49.345
Yeah.

43:58.989 --> 44:02.025
I'm gonna go.
I didn't really sleep.

44:05.963 --> 44:08.998
We can have dinner this weekend.
I'll pick a place.

44:09.066 --> 44:10.533
Good.

44:34.592 --> 44:36.826
<i>Why are you drinking here?</i>

44:36.894 --> 44:39.195
Come on.

44:39.263 --> 44:42.365
<i>I don't know what kind of surprise
you're gonna spring on me.</i>

44:44.735 --> 44:46.603
So Abe Drexler pulled a boner.

44:46.670 --> 44:48.238
It's to be expected.

44:49.573 --> 44:51.140
He seemed so nice.

44:51.208 --> 44:54.944
He's a man. He won't be happy
until he turns you out.

44:55.012 --> 44:56.312
What's that supposed to mean?

44:56.380 --> 44:58.448
Gotta be their girl.

44:58.516 --> 45:02.085
It's the way they want it.
Maybe it's biology.

45:02.152 --> 45:05.021
It's like men are
this vegetable soup

45:05.089 --> 45:08.157
And we can't put 'em
on a plate or eat 'em off the counter.

45:08.225 --> 45:11.060
So women are the pot.
They heat 'em up.

45:11.128 --> 45:13.196
They hold 'em.
They contain them.

45:15.299 --> 45:17.400
But who wants to be a pot?

45:17.468 --> 45:19.402
<i>Who the hell
said we're not soup?</i>

45:20.738 --> 45:22.472
I don't think that's true.

45:22.540 --> 45:24.541
It's been my experience.

45:26.343 --> 45:29.412
But you know, I wouldn't
have helped Abe out

45:29.480 --> 45:32.148
If I didn't think he was
some very interesting soup.

45:35.619 --> 45:37.387
Listen, go ahead without me.

45:37.454 --> 45:39.522
Another time.

45:39.590 --> 45:41.624
Are you angry or lovesick?

45:42.893 --> 45:44.193
I don't know.

45:46.363 --> 45:47.797
Night, peg.

46:26.804 --> 46:28.605
<i>Could you hold that?</i>

46:31.208 --> 46:32.742
Hello.
