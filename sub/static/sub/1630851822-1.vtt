04:04.369 --> 04:07.830

your knife and just roll it.

<i>quickly in the kitchen, right?</i>

04:21.219 --> 04:23.012

- Okay.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.806
- Then you're gonna
take this stem out.

04:24.889 --> 04:27.558
Boom.
Cut this up into random pieces.

04:27.642 --> 04:29.352
<i>And then we're gonna</i>
<i>do the same thing</i>

04:29.435 --> 04:31.187
<i>with the other pepper.</i>
- Okay.

04:31.270 --> 04:32.605
- Honestly, Sel,
the knife skills

04:32.689 --> 04:34.482
aren't as bad
as I was expecting.

04:34.565 --> 04:38.152
- [laughs] We're gonna move on
to the tomatoes at this point.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.029
- How many?
- Six tomatoes.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.698
- Thanks, babes.
Got a nice feel to them.

04:41.781 --> 04:43.533
Oh!
- Oh, gosh.

04:43.616 --> 04:45.451
Just hand them to me.

04:45.535 --> 04:47.870
Oops. Okay. Sorry. Pfff!

<i>So for this,</i>
<i>you just wanna cut them up.</i>

04:51.374 --> 04:53.042

Splatow's what I like to say
when it hits the cutting board.

04:55.294 --> 04:56.504
- Okay.

04:56.587 --> 04:58.256

like, six pieces.

04:58.339 --> 04:59.841
- Got it.

04:59.924 --> 05:01.759
- So I don't even remember
the last time I ate this dish,

05:01.843 --> 05:04.220
but I grew up in Nigeria
a little bit.

05:04.303 --> 05:06.556
- Yeah.
<i>- I was a really bad kid.</i>

05:06.639 --> 05:08.391
<i>I grew up in the Bronx</i>
<i>in New York City.</i>

05:08.474 --> 05:09.976

<i>a two-week vacation</i>

in Nigeria.

05:15.106 --> 05:16.315

05:16.399 --> 05:17.775
- And she left me there
for two years

<i>and appreciate what I have</i>
<i>here in America.</i>

05:24.824 --> 05:27.243
- Yeah.

<i>You know,</i>
<i>I had to go to school.</i>

05:28.661 --> 05:30.079

<i>by being there.</i>

05:34.542 --> 05:35.960

05:36.044 --> 05:37.628

05:37.712 --> 05:39.255

<i>a catering company,</i>

<i>and she threw me an apron</i>
<i>when I was,</i>

05:40.923 --> 05:42.967
like, five years old,
and I had to help out.

05:43.051 --> 05:44.927

to really appreciate

05:45.011 --> 05:47.055
ingredients
and where they come from

05:47.138 --> 05:48.347
when I was living in Africa.

<i>in the bowl.</i>

05:58.775 --> 06:00.193

06:00.276 --> 06:01.611
<i>- And then we're gonna</i>
<i>move on to the onions.</i>

06:01.694 --> 06:03.112
- I'll get you the onions.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.782
- Do you miss your,
uh, your hair, from before?

06:05.865 --> 06:07.241
- Nope, I don't.

06:07.325 --> 06:08.951
- Sometimes you gotta
lose something

07:19.188 --> 07:20.523
- All right.

07:20.606 --> 07:22.400
- So we're gonna take
one of these things,

07:22.483 --> 07:23.734
scotch bonnet pepper.

07:23.818 --> 07:26.487
Oh, yeah. This thing is hot.
- Yeah?

07:26.571 --> 07:28.573
- Just take off the stem.
Throw it in the bowl.

07:28.656 --> 07:31.033
- All of them? All of them?
- No, one. One.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.202
Just one. Just one.
- No! No, no, no! Just one!

07:33.286 --> 07:34.495
Just one!
- Oh, my God! Okay.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.038
- If we put all of them
in there,

07:36.122 --> 07:38.749
you will have a horrible time
later on tonight.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.376
- Yeah.
Whew.

07:40.459 --> 07:41.752
- I think it's about, like,

07:41.836 --> 07:43.337
20 times more spicier
than a jalapeño.

07:43.421 --> 07:44.839
- Oh, my God.
<i>- On the Scoville.</i>

07:44.922 --> 07:46.507
- I'd better be able
to eat this.

07:46.591 --> 07:49.260
- I got you.
I'm not gonna steer you wrong.

07:49.343 --> 07:51.345
Um, do you have garlic?

07:51.429 --> 07:52.638
- Let's get my garlic.

07:52.722 --> 07:54.348
- I would say
14 cloves of garlic.

07:54.432 --> 07:55.641
- 14!
- Okay.

07:55.725 --> 07:56.976
- Yummy.
- Got it.

07:57.059 --> 07:59.020
- Maggi cubes,
they look like dice.

07:59.103 --> 08:00.605
- Can you explain to me
what this is?

08:00.688 --> 08:02.064
- It's a bouillon cube--
you know,

08:02.148 --> 08:03.858
a bunch of different
vegetables,

08:03.941 --> 08:05.568
all cooked down to a paste.

08:05.651 --> 08:09.447
You know, it adds salt, and
it crystallizes into this form.

08:09.530 --> 08:12.283
And you can add a lot of flavor
in a little bit of time.

08:12.366 --> 08:14.285
- Obviously, I unwrap it
and then throw it in.

08:14.368 --> 08:15.912
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>That would be helpful.</i>

08:15.995 --> 08:18.539
<i>Um, eight of them.</i>
- Okay.

08:18.623 --> 08:21.167
- I'll help you.
- Thank you.

08:21.250 --> 08:23.544
- Oh, see, this is why
I shouldn't get nails.

08:23.628 --> 08:24.754
Okay.

08:24.837 --> 08:26.422
- What kinda nails
you got goin' on?

08:26.505 --> 08:28.841
- Tryin' to do the sassy hands,
you know what I mean?

08:28.925 --> 08:30.843
[laughter]

08:30.927 --> 08:33.095
Got it.
- All right, done.

08:33.179 --> 08:36.057
Now, you got ginger over there?
- Yes, I do.

08:36.140 --> 08:39.352
- So I would rip off, like,
a 2-inch knob of ginger.

08:39.435 --> 08:41.437
- Okay, so maybe
cut the tip off?

08:41.520 --> 08:43.356
[laughter]

08:43.439 --> 08:46.025
<i>- Cut whatever part</i>
<i>you want off.</i>

08:46.108 --> 08:47.944
All right, so we're gonna
peel this with a spoon.

08:48.027 --> 08:49.237
<i>- Okay.</i>
<i>- Get your spoon.</i>

08:49.320 --> 08:50.947
- I would get a paper towel.

08:51.030 --> 08:52.114
- Got it.

08:52.198 --> 08:53.824
- This is another
kitchen trick.

08:53.908 --> 08:57.245
So you're just gonna peel it
right onto that paper towel.

08:57.328 --> 09:00.039
- Okay.
- Oh. This is a new technique.

09:00.122 --> 09:02.583
- You should--you could be
a little aggressive with it.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.252
- Pfff.
- Oh.

09:04.335 --> 09:05.962
Any time when someone's like,
"Selena, be aggressive,"

09:06.045 --> 09:08.214
she really, really
takes it far.

09:08.297 --> 09:09.799
- All right.

09:09.882 --> 09:11.509
Now, just pick up that
paper towel and throw it out.

09:11.592 --> 09:14.470
<i>Look at that.</i>
<i>We out, moving on.</i>

09:14.553 --> 09:15.805
Staying hydrated.
Cheers to that.

09:15.888 --> 09:17.181
- Cheers.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.808
<i>- We're gonna just chop</i>
<i>this ginger up</i>

09:18.891 --> 09:20.893
into manageable pieces.

09:20.977 --> 09:23.646
- God, my cutting
is a lot better.

09:23.729 --> 09:26.232
<i>- Got it! You got it.</i>
- Okay.

09:26.315 --> 09:27.984
- You're gonna take
two teaspoons

09:28.067 --> 09:31.112
of Jamaican curry powder
into that aromatic bowl.

09:31.195 --> 09:32.488
- Okay, got it.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.865
- Then we're gonna do
1/2 cup of tomato paste.

09:34.949 --> 09:36.409
And I'ma wait for you

09:36.492 --> 09:37.994
<i>'cause I see your can</i>
<i>is not opened yet.</i>

09:38.077 --> 09:41.289
- Oh, no.
Papa, can you help me?

09:41.372 --> 09:43.499
- We can't open
the tomato paste.

09:43.582 --> 09:45.167
- I don't know if I can--
- Don't laugh at me.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.712
it's just 'cause I don't know
all the fancy stuff.

09:47.795 --> 09:49.297
This is fancy.
<i>- It's all right.</i>

09:49.380 --> 09:51.048
<i>It's a good excuse</i>
<i>for me to see Papa.</i>

09:51.132 --> 09:52.633
- Papa, this is Kwame.
- Kwame, it's nice meeting you.

09:52.717 --> 09:54.677
- What's up, Papa?
- Nice meeting you.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.429
- I don't--might get your Nana
to hold this.

09:56.512 --> 09:58.180
- See? Ah. See?
You don't know how to do it.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.016
You out of all people,
don't know how to do something.

10:00.099 --> 10:01.392
- You think Nana knows
how to do it?

10:01.475 --> 10:02.893
- Yep, she's good
at getting that.

10:02.977 --> 10:04.186
- Nana?
- Yeah.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.604
- Come here.
This is a--oh, wait.

10:05.688 --> 10:07.106
<i>- You gotta put</i>
<i>that little part.</i>

10:07.189 --> 10:09.191
- There it goes.
- Oh, he did it!

10:09.275 --> 10:12.194
- Wow, Papa to the rescue.
- I just looked at it.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.655
<i>- It's an outside can opener,</i>
<i>not the inside.</i>

10:14.739 --> 10:16.073
- Yeah. I think I got it.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.491
I think I got it.
I don't know if I did. Here.

10:17.575 --> 10:19.201
- Hah! It didn't work.
- Come here.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.162
Come here, Ma. Come here, Nan.
- Use the little teeth.

10:21.245 --> 10:22.621
- Fix this thing.

10:22.705 --> 10:24.540
- This is what happens
when you get fancy stuff.

10:24.623 --> 10:25.750
<i>You just need</i>
<i>a regular can opener.</i>

10:25.833 --> 10:27.084
- Ah, got it!
- Whoo!

10:27.168 --> 10:28.419
- That's what--look.
- You get it?

10:28.502 --> 10:29.628
- Yep, we got it. We're good.

10:29.712 --> 10:31.255
- You had it. You had it.
- I did?

10:31.339 --> 10:32.798
<i>- That sounds like</i>
<i>a Texas accent over there.</i>

10:32.882 --> 10:34.967
<i>I don't know.</i>
- It is. You got it?

10:35.051 --> 10:36.302
- Yep, from Texas.
- So, I did it. I was right.

10:36.385 --> 10:37.928
- Nice to meet you.

10:38.012 --> 10:39.513
- It's nice to meet you, boy.
<i>- Nice to meet you too.</i>

10:39.597 --> 10:41.057
- So I got it. I guess.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.893
- So you're gonna take
about 1/2 cup.

10:43.976 --> 10:47.688
- Oh, this is gonna be delish.
- Got it.

10:47.772 --> 10:50.066
- So what we're gonna do is,
we're gonna cook this all down.

10:50.149 --> 10:52.318
<i>- So make sure</i>
<i>you have your pot</i>

10:52.401 --> 10:53.694
that you're gonna
be cooking this in.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.279
It should be a pot, like,
this big.

10:55.363 --> 10:57.156
<i>But first we're gonna put it</i>
<i>in the blender,</i>

10:57.239 --> 10:58.449
and then we're gonna
let this cook.

10:58.532 --> 11:01.619
And as it cooks,
it's gonna reduce.

11:01.702 --> 11:03.412
- All right, plugged up.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.289
- So put a little bit of oil
in the pot.

11:05.373 --> 11:08.042
Probably, like, 1/2 cup of oil.

11:08.125 --> 11:09.877
We're winging it together.
There you go, perfect.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.379
- Ah.
- I like that. Now turn it on?

11:11.462 --> 11:13.923
- Now turn it on low?
<i>- Yeah, on low.</i>

11:14.006 --> 11:15.257
And then you're gonna
do the same amount

11:15.341 --> 11:17.385
in the blender of oil.
- Okay.

11:17.468 --> 11:19.053
- Okay. Guessing.
<i>- That same winging it amount.</i>

11:19.136 --> 11:20.846
I'm guessing. I'm guessing.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.598
- So then you're gonna put
all of this in the blender.

11:22.681 --> 11:24.600
You may need to do it in, like,
two different tries.

11:24.683 --> 11:26.352
- Whoa.
- Let me know if you need me.

11:26.435 --> 11:27.937
- I would fill it up
maybe 3/4 of the way.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.814
Don't go all the way
to the top.

11:29.897 --> 11:31.899
- I'm stressed right now, okay?

11:31.982 --> 11:33.150
- Repeat after me:

11:33.234 --> 11:34.610
there's no stress
in Kwame's kitchen.

11:34.693 --> 11:37.279
- There's no stress
in Kwame's kitchen.

11:37.363 --> 11:38.781
- Louder!

11:38.864 --> 11:40.449
- There's no--what?

11:40.533 --> 11:43.786
- Stress in Kwame's kitchen!
- Stress in Kwame--

11:43.869 --> 11:45.162
<i>- There we go. All right.</i>

11:45.246 --> 11:46.497
Let's put the top on or else

11:46.580 --> 11:48.082
it's gonna be
a messy-ass kitchen.

11:48.165 --> 11:51.419
- Okay.
- One, two, three.

11:51.502 --> 11:52.962
Turn it all the way up.
Turn it up.

11:53.045 --> 11:54.964
Turn it up. Turn it up.
Turn it up.

11:55.047 --> 11:56.173
Turn it up. Turn it up!

11:56.257 --> 11:58.050
- Try to be enthusiastic,
Selena.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.969
- [yells]
- Hold it! Selena!

12:00.052 --> 12:03.931
- Yay! [laughs]
All right.

12:04.014 --> 12:05.975
We're gonna pour that right
into that pan and keep going.

12:06.058 --> 12:08.811
- All right.
That smells bomb, by the way.

12:08.894 --> 12:10.813
- Mm-hmm.
Making me hungry.

12:10.896 --> 12:13.023
- ♪ Making me hungry ♪

12:13.107 --> 12:14.525
- Oh, you can sing?
- Ooh!

12:14.608 --> 12:15.901
Where's that voice been hiding?

12:15.985 --> 12:17.778
- I got a little--
I got some talent.

12:17.862 --> 12:19.363
<i>Most of it's in the kitchen.</i>

12:19.447 --> 12:20.990
- We're gonna have to test
those singing skills.

12:21.073 --> 12:22.324
<i>Okay.</i>
- And repeat, repeat again.

12:22.408 --> 12:25.995
A little bit of oil,
some vegetables.

12:26.078 --> 12:27.496
- Ah! Oh, my gosh.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.623
Here comes the big spicy one.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.834
- Oh, no.
I'm nervous about that.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.086
- Okay.
- You're looking good.

12:34.170 --> 12:37.298
[blenders whirring]

12:41.760 --> 12:43.721
Is that a pink silk shirt
you're wearing?

12:43.804 --> 12:45.222
- Well, yeah.

12:45.306 --> 12:47.808
It's only the worst thing
to wear when you're cooking.

12:47.892 --> 12:49.226
- [laughs]
It looks good.

12:49.310 --> 12:51.353
It looks good.
It matches your, uh, pot.

12:51.437 --> 12:54.732
<i>So this is gonna take about</i>
<i>30 to 45 minutes to cook down.</i>

12:54.815 --> 12:56.066
- Okay.
<i>- But in the meantime,</i>

12:56.150 --> 12:57.526
<i>we're gonna prep</i>
<i>our other stuff.</i>

12:57.610 --> 12:59.236
<i>So we're gonna sear</i>
<i>our chicken,</i>

12:59.320 --> 13:00.946
and then that way,
once this is finished,

13:01.030 --> 13:02.531
we can start cooking the
chicken directly in that sauce.

13:02.615 --> 13:03.866
<i>- Mmm. Yum.</i>
- All right?

13:03.949 --> 13:05.159
- Yum.
- All right.

13:05.242 --> 13:06.785
- Wait, should I plate up
my station?

13:06.869 --> 13:08.329
- I would love that.
<i>- Okay.</i>

13:08.412 --> 13:10.039
- I love how you call it
a station.

13:10.122 --> 13:11.582
[both laugh]

13:11.665 --> 13:13.876
- Chef, should I clean up
my station before I go home?

13:13.959 --> 13:17.129
Uh, you are home, Selena.
You're--you're home.

13:17.213 --> 13:19.131
- I just moved into this house
a year ago.

13:19.215 --> 13:21.050
- I moved into this house
five months ago.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.093
<i>You gotta come over</i>
<i>for dinner sometime.</i>

13:23.177 --> 13:26.722
- I was waiting for the invite.
I'm not kidding.

13:26.805 --> 13:28.933
- All right, so we're gonna
move on to this chicken.

13:29.016 --> 13:30.559
We have these chicken quarters.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.144
I'm gonna cut them
because I feel like

13:32.228 --> 13:34.438
<i>they cook more efficiently</i>

13:34.522 --> 13:36.732
when you separate the leg
from the thighs.

13:36.815 --> 13:38.442
- Perfect.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.319
- And maybe we'll put
our gloves on for this.

13:40.402 --> 13:42.071
- Okay.
- Then flip it over.

13:42.154 --> 13:43.364
You're gonna see this line.

13:43.447 --> 13:44.865
It's pretty much,
like, this fat line.

13:44.949 --> 13:46.408
- Okay.
<i>- Cut right through that.</i>

13:46.492 --> 13:47.993
<i>You're gonna cut</i>
<i>right through the bone,</i>

13:48.077 --> 13:49.995
right through the joint.
There you go.

13:50.079 --> 13:51.455
You're probably
hitting bone right there.

13:51.539 --> 13:52.957
It looks like
you're hitting bone.

13:53.040 --> 13:54.917
- This is the bone, right here.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.544
- Yeah, but the fat line

13:56.627 --> 13:58.879
<i>is kind of right</i>
<i>where your knife is right now.</i>

13:58.963 --> 14:02.007
<i>Right there. Cut right there.</i>
<i>Nope. Nope. Maybe not.</i>

14:02.091 --> 14:04.593
- Oh, Sel! Oh, my gosh.
[laughs]

14:04.677 --> 14:06.303
<i>- Why don't you</i>
<i>pick this thing up</i>

14:06.387 --> 14:07.972
and then crack it like this?

14:08.055 --> 14:11.350
You're gonna feel that--
uh, do it the other way.

14:11.433 --> 14:13.477
Yeah!
- Oh! Whoo!

14:13.561 --> 14:14.937
<i>- How about that?</i>

14:15.020 --> 14:16.814
We gonna try this
every single way

14:16.897 --> 14:19.275
we need to do it
to get the job done.

14:19.358 --> 14:20.776
- That way.
- Yes.

14:20.859 --> 14:22.361
- All right, so do that
to the rest of them.

14:22.444 --> 14:24.196
<i>That's it.</i>
<i>'Cause guess what I said?</i>

14:24.280 --> 14:26.198
- No stress.
- Yes!

14:26.282 --> 14:29.868
Look at this: Butchery 101
with Selena and Kwame.

14:29.952 --> 14:31.036
- Oh!

14:31.120 --> 14:32.955
- I feel really good
about this.

14:33.038 --> 14:35.249
- I do too. Yes!

14:35.332 --> 14:36.542
- Yay!

14:36.625 --> 14:38.294
- Got all the chicken.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.004
<i>- Raquelle?</i>
- Yes?

14:40.087 --> 14:41.171
- Where's your name from,
by the way?

14:41.255 --> 14:42.298
- It's actually, it's Spanish.

14:42.381 --> 14:43.716
- I thought it was gonna be

14:43.799 --> 14:46.010
a Black girl here,
with the name Raquelle.

14:46.093 --> 14:48.053
- And your brother's name
is Tyrone?

14:48.137 --> 14:50.222
- Oh, my gosh.
[laughter]

14:50.306 --> 14:52.016
- So I wasn't
what you were expecting.

14:52.099 --> 14:53.726
- I wouldn't have bet on
a blonde girl named Raquelle,

14:53.809 --> 14:55.936
I'll tell you that much.

14:56.020 --> 14:57.938
- I love that.

14:58.022 --> 15:00.232
- All right, Raquelle,
you're gonna get another pot,

15:00.316 --> 15:02.818
and you're gonna put it
on the stove, high heat,

15:02.901 --> 15:04.820
a little bit of oil,
eyeball it,

15:04.903 --> 15:06.322
'cause I believe in you.

15:06.405 --> 15:09.325
- Love the support.
Kwame, I have to ask you...

15:09.408 --> 15:11.785
- Ask me anything.
<i>- Outside of Selena Gomez,</i>

15:11.869 --> 15:13.621
who is the most
impressive person

15:13.704 --> 15:14.997
that you've ever cooked for?

15:15.080 --> 15:17.625
- It's probably a tie
between, um,

15:17.708 --> 15:21.378
Jay-Z and Beyoncé,
and Barack and Michelle Obama.

15:21.462 --> 15:22.630
<i>- Wow!</i>

15:22.713 --> 15:24.006
- So what you're gonna do,
Selena,

15:24.089 --> 15:25.549
we're just gonna
season this chicken,

15:25.633 --> 15:26.717
and we're gonna season
from high up.

15:26.800 --> 15:30.304
- So here we go. From the top.

15:30.387 --> 15:32.181
- Yeah, there you go.
You've got it.

15:32.264 --> 15:34.350
- Okay, we've got
the oil on high.

15:34.433 --> 15:35.768
- Let's put the chicken in.

15:35.851 --> 15:37.686
And only put, like,
four pieces in at a time.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.647
<i>'Cause you don't want</i>
<i>to crowd the pan.</i>

15:39.730 --> 15:40.939
- Ooh!

15:41.023 --> 15:42.691
- It hurts a little bit,
but it's good.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.401
<i>So we're not cooking it</i>
<i>all the way through.</i>

15:44.485 --> 15:46.445
We're just browning it.
- Okay.

15:46.528 --> 15:48.405
- And then I got
a sheet tray on the side

15:48.489 --> 15:50.032
so I can just
put it on the sheet tray.

15:50.115 --> 15:51.867
And then we're gonna cook it
in that sauce, okay?

15:51.950 --> 15:54.953
- Amazing.
- Wait. Are you good?

15:55.037 --> 15:58.957
[pots and pans clattering]

15:59.041 --> 16:02.127
- Yo, what is happening
over there?

16:02.211 --> 16:03.712
- That's what my life
sounds like.

16:03.796 --> 16:06.256
- [laughs]
- Can I flip the chicken over?

16:06.340 --> 16:09.259
- If it's brown on one side,
flip it over.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.930
- Okay.

16:13.013 --> 16:17.434
- Oh, Sel with the moves.
Kwame, do you dance?

16:17.518 --> 16:19.144
- I don't dance well,
but I dance.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.562
- Love it.

16:20.646 --> 16:22.606
- How's your chicken looking?
Looks good?

16:22.690 --> 16:24.233
- The chicken looks incredible.

16:24.316 --> 16:26.068
<i>- We're just getting</i>
<i>a nice sear on it,</i>

16:26.151 --> 16:28.612
a nice--we call it GBD,
golden brown delicious.

16:28.696 --> 16:31.156
- I'm gonna use that, GBD.
- I love that.

16:33.158 --> 16:34.910
All right, my chicken's done.

16:34.993 --> 16:36.662
- It's doing its thing?
It's good? All right.

16:36.745 --> 16:39.540
- Wait, this looks so good.
- Right?

16:41.166 --> 16:42.501
Are you really eating it now?
- I'm starving.

16:42.584 --> 16:44.378
- It's not cooked all the way.

16:44.461 --> 16:46.755
- No, I just--it's not cook--
what do you mean?

16:46.839 --> 16:49.258
- It's not cooked all the way.
It's just brown.

16:49.341 --> 16:51.635
- It's so fricking good.

16:51.719 --> 16:53.595
- So my oil got a little
too hot so I dumped it.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.264
- Oh, I need to do that
as well.

16:55.347 --> 16:57.433
- Yours is black. It's so dark.
<i>- Yeah, probably.</i>

16:57.516 --> 17:00.102
Now, what we're gonna do,
Selena.

17:00.185 --> 17:01.603
- Yes.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.147
- Take that same pot
and put it back on the stove.

17:03.230 --> 17:05.107
- Even if it's brown?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

17:05.190 --> 17:06.775
So we're gonna deglaze the pan.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.236
All that brown stuff is good.
It's for flavor, right?

17:09.319 --> 17:10.279
- Ooh.
- Right.

17:10.362 --> 17:12.156
- So we're gonna put, like,

17:12.239 --> 17:15.284
maybe, like, three ladles
of this red stew

17:15.367 --> 17:17.995
in that same pot.

17:18.078 --> 17:19.496
Let's do six.
- What?

17:19.580 --> 17:21.248
- We'll do six ladles
full in here.

17:21.331 --> 17:23.459
- Okay.
- I'm feelin' frisky today.

17:23.542 --> 17:25.294
And then I'm gonna put
my chicken in there.

17:25.377 --> 17:26.920
- This is one
of the best smells

17:27.004 --> 17:29.298
I've smelled in a long time.
- Yeah.

17:29.381 --> 17:31.383
- Yeah, I'm making it
into a cologne.

17:31.467 --> 17:34.428
- [laughs]
- Eau du Kwame.

17:34.511 --> 17:37.473
And then you can put a little
bit more stew on top of it.

17:37.556 --> 17:39.475
- Great.
- Oh, that looks good.

17:39.558 --> 17:41.226
- This looks crazy good.

17:41.310 --> 17:44.146
- Yo, look at you, Selena,
making some Nigerian food.

17:44.229 --> 17:45.814
- I'm tryin'.
- Whoo!

17:45.898 --> 17:48.650
- So that you can get you
a West African man.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.444
<i>You can get you</i>
<i>a Jamaican man,</i>

17:50.527 --> 17:52.321
<i>a white man, Mexican,</i>
<i>whatever now.</i>

17:52.404 --> 17:54.198
Now you got it all covered.

17:54.281 --> 17:55.741
All right, so, Selena,

17:55.824 --> 17:57.659
we're gonna put, like,
a cup of chicken stock.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.912
And you can eyeball it.
<i>- A lot of eyeballing.</i>

17:59.995 --> 18:01.497
- And then I'm gonna
add some salt.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.457
And then,
we're just gonna let it cook.

18:03.540 --> 18:05.167
'Cause we just
browned the chicken.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.960
We didn't cook it
all the way through.

18:07.044 --> 18:08.629
- That's why you were
telling me not to eat it.

18:08.712 --> 18:09.922
- I know.

18:10.005 --> 18:11.673
- I took a little bite
of the chicken

18:11.757 --> 18:13.300
'cause it looked so good,
and Selena was like,

18:13.383 --> 18:15.594
"Do not eat it.
It's not cooked all the way."

18:15.677 --> 18:16.887
- It's raw. It's just raw.

18:16.970 --> 18:19.014
- So do I put this
on a medium heat?

18:19.097 --> 18:20.307
- Yeah, like, medium heat,

18:20.390 --> 18:21.475
and then you can
put the lid on it

18:21.558 --> 18:22.893
and just let it do its thing.

18:22.976 --> 18:24.645
And it'll cook down
really, really nicely.

18:24.728 --> 18:26.105
- Okay.

18:26.188 --> 18:28.065
- We do want to clean
our cutting board

18:28.148 --> 18:29.733
because we did
cut raw chicken on it.

18:29.817 --> 18:31.527
- You gotta help me, babe.
- Okay.

18:31.610 --> 18:34.196
Coming. Ow! Oh!
- Are you okay?

18:34.279 --> 18:36.365
- I don't know
how I just did that!

18:36.448 --> 18:38.408
[laughs]
How does this happen?

18:38.492 --> 18:40.953
I just whacked my knee
on the chair.

18:43.413 --> 18:45.791
Whoa!

18:45.874 --> 18:47.125
<i>- Y'all okay over there?</i>

18:47.209 --> 18:48.544
- Yeah, we're okay.
We're okay.

18:48.627 --> 18:50.629
- Papa, make sure
they're okay, please.

18:50.712 --> 18:52.047
- Raquelle, she's an accident

18:52.130 --> 18:54.091
looking for a happening
all the time.

18:54.174 --> 18:55.634
- You're a happening.

18:55.717 --> 18:57.386
- I knew--
I knew we needed Papa.

18:57.469 --> 18:58.846
- Day one,
you ripped your shirt.

18:58.929 --> 19:00.597
I now have a bruise on my knee.

19:00.681 --> 19:02.683
- Yep, we're doing great.

19:02.766 --> 19:05.602
- I ate raw chicken.
- Chicken sashimi.

19:05.686 --> 19:07.145
- Oh, thank you, Papa.
<i>- It's okay.</i>

19:07.229 --> 19:08.772
We got the triple threat
goin' on here.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.691
This is season three:
looking good,

19:10.774 --> 19:12.401
smelling good, cooking good.
<i>- Whoo!</i>

19:12.484 --> 19:14.611
- We're not playin' on
season three, we're doin' it.

19:14.695 --> 19:16.029
- Nope.
- Nah, nah.

19:16.113 --> 19:17.447
We're gonna let
that continue to cook.

19:17.531 --> 19:18.907
We're gonna break down
this plantain,

19:18.991 --> 19:20.951
which is pretty much
a Caribbean banana.

19:21.034 --> 19:22.911
It's a banana with dreadlocks.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.705
- I'm dying. That's hilarious.

19:24.788 --> 19:27.457
- How many do we need?
- I would just say two.

19:27.541 --> 19:29.960
- So if you had to have
someone cooking with you,

19:30.043 --> 19:32.504
like Sel has me,
who would be your go-to?

19:32.588 --> 19:34.047
- I have two best friends.

19:34.131 --> 19:36.258
One's name is Paz,
and the other one's Marquise.

19:36.341 --> 19:38.385
He's my friend from, like,
back home in the Bronx.

19:38.468 --> 19:40.596
And he's actually
flying in tomorrow,

19:40.679 --> 19:42.347
<i>and we're gonna have</i>
<i>so much fun!</i>

19:42.431 --> 19:44.433
- Why don't we eat together?
- I was gonna say.

19:44.516 --> 19:45.851
- Yeah.
- We should do dinner.

19:45.934 --> 19:48.312
Maybe Marquise is my man.
Is he single?

19:48.395 --> 19:50.147
- Maybe he's your--
he is single.

19:50.230 --> 19:51.648
- Hey.
- [laughs]

19:51.732 --> 19:53.775
- Kwame, we've been trying
to get her somebody

19:53.859 --> 19:56.111
for the last five years.
- Oh, my gosh.

19:56.194 --> 19:58.030
- Can she bring a Black guy
back to Texas?

19:58.113 --> 19:59.573
- Yeah, she can.
- [laughs]

19:59.656 --> 20:01.408
- Yep, no problem.

20:01.491 --> 20:03.452
- So we're gonna cut these in
on a bias.

20:03.535 --> 20:04.828
<i>Boom.</i>

20:08.957 --> 20:10.250
You know what?

20:10.334 --> 20:11.627
Any way you cut it
is going to be delicious.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.128
There's no stress
in Kwame's kitchen.

20:13.211 --> 20:15.005
- Oh, good.
You did a good job cutting.

20:15.088 --> 20:16.465
See, when there's, like,

20:16.548 --> 20:19.051
no technique needed,
you actually kill it.

20:19.134 --> 20:21.094
- When there's no technique
needed, you do a great job.

20:21.178 --> 20:22.638
That's a great compliment.
- Yeah.

20:22.721 --> 20:23.847
[both laugh]

20:23.931 --> 20:26.183
That's a backhanded compliment.

20:26.266 --> 20:27.726
- I meant it
in a loving way.

20:27.809 --> 20:29.227
- I know. I love you.

20:29.311 --> 20:33.190
- All right, so I put
my pan on for the rice.

20:33.273 --> 20:35.108
- Is this good for rice?
- Yeah, that'll work.

20:35.192 --> 20:36.360
That'll work, for sure.

20:36.443 --> 20:37.945
And then you're gonna
put, like,

20:38.028 --> 20:40.447
three tablespoons of oil
in here.

20:40.530 --> 20:41.990
- One, two, three.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.784
- I love it. She's winging it.

20:43.867 --> 20:45.327
- And you're gonna put it
on medium heat.

20:45.410 --> 20:47.663
All right,
we're gonna measure out

20:47.746 --> 20:49.414
two cups of rice.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.833
- Okay. Urgh! Okay.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.877
- You got it. You got this.
I believe in you.

20:53.961 --> 20:56.171
- One, two.

20:56.254 --> 20:58.173
- We're gonna be, like,
cooking the rice in the fat.

20:58.256 --> 20:59.758
It's called parching the rice.

20:59.841 --> 21:01.093
And that's gonna coat

21:01.176 --> 21:03.136
each individual grain of rice
with oil.

21:03.220 --> 21:05.430
And that's gonna make it
separate a little bit easier.

21:05.514 --> 21:06.390
- Okay, great.

21:06.473 --> 21:08.058
It's hot. I'm hot.

21:08.141 --> 21:09.267
- [laughs]

21:09.351 --> 21:12.062
- Now, what I want y'all to do

21:12.145 --> 21:14.481
is take 2 cups of chicken stock

21:14.564 --> 21:17.484
and then 2 cups
of that red stew.

21:19.695 --> 21:21.363
Add a little bit of salt.
- Okay.

21:21.446 --> 21:22.698
<i>- And guess what?</i>

21:22.781 --> 21:24.116
We're gonna put
a little lid on that

21:24.199 --> 21:26.702
and let it do its thing.

21:26.785 --> 21:30.580
Now I'm gonna get my pan ready
for my plantains

21:30.664 --> 21:32.708
because we're so close to glory
at this point.

21:32.791 --> 21:34.042
- [laughs]

21:34.126 --> 21:35.627
- Do you throw a lot of parties
and stuff?

21:35.711 --> 21:37.254
- No, I don't.
[laughs]

21:37.337 --> 21:39.881
- We had a crazy party here
the other day.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.717
All you have to do
is play this one song.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.093
Everyone gets
on the dance floor

21:43.176 --> 21:44.553
when that song comes on.

21:44.636 --> 21:47.097
And it was "Back That Azz Up"
by Juvenile.

21:47.180 --> 21:48.515
- Oh, my gosh.

21:48.598 --> 21:49.933
- I put that song on,
and everyone was like,

21:50.017 --> 21:52.394
bum, bum, bum, bum.
<i>- No way.</i>

21:52.477 --> 21:55.355
- I never get invited
to cool parties.

21:55.439 --> 21:57.774
- Well, now we're gonna
have dinner at Kwame's.

21:57.858 --> 21:59.901
- And Marquise will be here.
Marquise gotta meet Raquelle.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.445
- I cannot wait
to meet Marquise.

22:01.528 --> 22:03.155
I'm so excited.
[laughs]

22:03.238 --> 22:06.825
- You know the key to my heart
is when someone invites me

22:06.908 --> 22:10.412
into their home and plays
"Back That Azz Up."

22:12.164 --> 22:14.458
- We'll have a dinner party.
You filming tomorrow?

22:14.541 --> 22:16.043
- Let me check my schedule.

22:16.126 --> 22:18.128
I'll be in the studio
making some hits,

22:18.211 --> 22:20.672
but I can come after.
- Take my number down.

22:20.756 --> 22:23.425
- Oh. This is happening.
<i>- Get it.</i>

22:23.508 --> 22:24.885
- I've got it.
- I'm not playing.

22:24.968 --> 22:26.178
- This is dy--
I'm dying right now.

22:26.261 --> 22:27.637
- I think this is
the first time

22:27.721 --> 22:29.181
you've gotten a number
on "Selena + Chef."

22:29.264 --> 22:30.682
- I know, whoa. Okay, go.
What's your number?

22:30.766 --> 22:33.185
- [bleep] 2907.

22:33.268 --> 22:35.729
- She's calling you.
- Mm, your phone's off.

22:35.812 --> 22:37.981
Can you explain that to me?

22:38.065 --> 22:39.316
- It's dead.
<i>- Oh.</i>

22:39.399 --> 22:42.778
- It's dead?
- Just send me a text.

22:42.861 --> 22:44.488
All right, are you ready
for these plantains?

22:44.571 --> 22:45.947
- Yes, I am.

22:46.031 --> 22:49.117
- We're gonna fill a pot up
about 2 inches with oil.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.870
- She put it on low
or high or...

22:51.953 --> 22:54.956
- Medium heat. Put more oil.
Put, like, triple that.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.417
- Oh, triple the oil.
- Like that?

22:57.501 --> 22:59.419
- More, more, more, more, more,
more, more, more, more.

22:59.503 --> 23:01.129
- Wow.

23:01.213 --> 23:04.883
- More, more, more, more, more,
more, more, more, more, more!

23:04.966 --> 23:07.219
- Ah! It's all gone in.

23:07.302 --> 23:09.304
- All right,
so you should get

23:09.387 --> 23:11.807
a sheet tray with, like,
paper towels lined on it

23:11.890 --> 23:13.266
'cause we're gonna
fry the plantains

23:13.350 --> 23:14.684
and we're gonna pop them
on here right after.

23:14.768 --> 23:16.603
- Perfect.
<i>- Hold on. Let me see.</i>

23:16.686 --> 23:18.188
Who's on this other line
over here?

23:18.271 --> 23:20.816
- Hello?
- Hi, who's this?

23:20.899 --> 23:23.485
- [gasps] This is Selena Gomez.
Who's this?

23:23.568 --> 23:26.363
- This is Kwame Onwuachi.
- I see you.

23:26.446 --> 23:27.697
- Don't be blushing over there.
Stop it.

23:27.781 --> 23:29.116
- [laughs]

23:29.199 --> 23:30.534
I'm hanging up on you. Bye.

23:30.617 --> 23:31.868
<i>- [laughs]</i>
<i>Bye.</i>

23:31.952 --> 23:34.287
- Goodbye with that.
- That was great.

23:34.371 --> 23:35.872
<i>- All right.</i>
<i>Let's get back to business.</i>

23:35.956 --> 23:37.833
You have a thermometer on hand?
- Sure do.

23:37.916 --> 23:39.668
<i>- Wait, I don't use</i>
<i>thermometers like that,</i>

23:39.751 --> 23:42.546
but I'll put, like, a
wooden spoon in, like, the oil,

23:42.629 --> 23:43.880
and once it starts bubbling up,

23:43.964 --> 23:45.507
that's how I know
it's at 350 degrees.

23:45.590 --> 23:49.261
- Oh, okay.
So wooden spoon, here we go.

23:49.344 --> 23:50.762
- A chef tip.

23:50.846 --> 23:52.389
- What're y'all doing?
- We're hungry.

23:52.472 --> 23:53.890
<i>- All right, it's bubbling.</i>

23:53.974 --> 23:55.684
<i>All right,</i>
<i>let's add them plantains.</i>

23:55.767 --> 23:57.352
- Okay, let's do it.

23:57.435 --> 23:58.979
- How long do these cook?

23:59.062 --> 24:01.606
<i>- Just till they're, like,</i>
<i>golden brown delicious.</i>

24:01.690 --> 24:04.401
<i>And how's your rice looking?</i>

24:04.484 --> 24:06.027
- Ah! That rice?

24:06.111 --> 24:07.612
Perfect.
- Great.

24:07.696 --> 24:09.865
- Turn it off and bring it
over here, and we'll eat.

24:09.948 --> 24:11.783
<i>- We're almost there.</i>

24:11.867 --> 24:14.619
My plantains
look really good, GBD.

24:14.703 --> 24:16.079
I'ma take them out right now.

24:16.163 --> 24:17.539
- Perfect.

24:17.622 --> 24:19.374
<i>- All right, this is how</i>
<i>we're doing this.</i>

24:19.457 --> 24:21.793
I'm gonna put a little bit of
this Jollof rice on the plate.

24:21.877 --> 24:23.545
- Okay.
- Yum.

24:23.628 --> 24:25.797
- And a thigh, kinda like
right next to the rice.

24:25.881 --> 24:27.382
- Oh, I like that.
- Okay.

24:27.465 --> 24:28.633
<i>- I'm gonna put a little bit</i>
<i>of the stew</i>

24:28.717 --> 24:30.510
on top of it as well.

24:30.594 --> 24:33.471
And then I'm gonna put some of
the plantains next to that.

24:33.555 --> 24:37.100
- You guys, will you wait?
- Put it down.

24:37.184 --> 24:38.768
- This is Sunday supper, right?

24:38.852 --> 24:39.895
- Sunday supper.

24:39.978 --> 24:41.605
- Sunday supper on a Wednesday.

24:41.688 --> 24:43.148
- Yeah. Yeah.

24:43.231 --> 24:44.983
<i>- Looks good, Selena.</i>

24:45.066 --> 24:47.152
I like to put a little bit
of chives on the chicken,

24:47.235 --> 24:49.154
little bit of parsley
on the rice.

24:49.237 --> 24:51.573
Just a touch of it,
not too much.

24:51.656 --> 24:53.116
Just to brighten it up
a little bit.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.368
And you've got yourself
a Nigerian dish.

24:55.452 --> 24:57.454
You're an honorary Nigerian
for today.

24:57.537 --> 25:00.123
- Love this.
- Okay, Sellie?

25:01.041 --> 25:03.293
[camera shutter clicks]
Oh, you look good!

25:03.376 --> 25:04.961
<i>- Thanks.</i>
<i>- Damn.</i>

25:05.045 --> 25:06.171
- That blonde
is working for you,

25:06.254 --> 25:07.380
I'll tell you that much.

25:07.464 --> 25:09.090
- It is.
- Okay. Okay, I like it.

25:09.174 --> 25:10.634
- That's it.
Now it's time to eat.

25:10.717 --> 25:12.385
- Okay.

25:12.469 --> 25:14.512
- Oh, yeah.
<i>- Right?</i>

25:14.596 --> 25:15.931
- That's just delicious.
- Oh, my gosh.

25:16.014 --> 25:17.182
The chicken is literally--look.

25:17.265 --> 25:18.850
- Mmm.
- This fell off the bone.

25:18.934 --> 25:21.019
<i>- So this is what</i>
<i>my family would make,</i>

25:21.102 --> 25:23.396
especially when my grandfather
would come back from Nigeria

25:23.480 --> 25:24.773
to visit us in America.

25:24.856 --> 25:26.441
- Oh, my gosh.
<i>- And it's so wholesome.</i>

25:26.524 --> 25:28.276
- This for sure is one of
the best things I've ever had.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.694
- It's really incredible.

25:29.778 --> 25:31.446
- And it's not too spicy.
It's just right.

25:31.529 --> 25:33.114
<i>- No, that's what</i>
<i>I was saying.</i>

25:33.198 --> 25:35.075
Once it cooks down
and you know, you get all those

25:35.158 --> 25:38.119
other flavor elements in there,
it dampers down that spice.

25:38.203 --> 25:39.454
- Oh, my gosh.
- Incredible.

25:39.537 --> 25:40.747
- It's so good.
- Class.

25:40.830 --> 25:41.957
- Wow.
- Delicious.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.792
- I'm gonna say ten out of ten.

25:43.875 --> 25:44.960
- Ten out of ten!
<i>- Yeah.</i>

25:45.043 --> 25:46.628
- That's how we give it up.

25:46.711 --> 25:48.088
- I love this, by the way.

25:48.171 --> 25:49.548
We are not gonna
stop eating it.

25:49.631 --> 25:50.799
But I was wondering
if you could tell us

25:50.882 --> 25:52.467
a little bit more
about the charity

25:52.550 --> 25:54.302
that you want us to donate to.

25:54.386 --> 25:55.720
- Absolutely.

25:55.804 --> 25:58.974
I went to the Culinary
Institute of America.

25:59.057 --> 26:01.935
<i>It was very difficult for me</i>
<i>to afford to even go there,</i>

26:02.018 --> 26:04.688
<i>so I set up the Kwame Onwuachi</i>
<i>Scholarship Fund</i>

26:04.771 --> 26:07.065
where we put
an up-and-coming chef

26:07.148 --> 26:08.483
mainly from the inner city

26:08.566 --> 26:10.443
<i>through that program</i>
<i>on a full ride.</i>

26:10.527 --> 26:12.195
<i>They don't have to worry about</i>
<i>anything while they're there.</i>

26:12.279 --> 26:13.655
- Wow. That's amazing.

26:13.738 --> 26:15.532
We are very honored
to give back.

26:15.615 --> 26:16.783
- Absolutely.

26:16.866 --> 26:18.285
- Kwame, this has been
so much fun.

26:18.368 --> 26:20.662
<i>Legit, you are</i>
<i>the coolest hang,</i>

26:20.745 --> 26:22.998
and I can't wait
to hang out with you tomorrow.

26:23.081 --> 26:25.333
- I can't wait to back that ass
up tomorrow night.

26:58.575 --> 27:00.410

I thought you killed it.

27:00.493 --> 27:02.704
- Nana?
- I'd say a five.

27:02.787 --> 27:05.290
- Would you normally
order this?

27:05.373 --> 27:06.541
- No.

27:06.624 --> 27:07.959
- And you're trying it,
and you like it?

27:08.043 --> 27:09.127
- Mm-hmm.

27:09.210 --> 27:10.378
