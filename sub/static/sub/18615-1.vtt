05:03.919 --> 05:07.288
Excuse me, can I sit here?
Where I am I only see the back.

05:07.506 --> 05:09.084
Ahead.

05:11.801 --> 05:13.425
Thank you.

05:14.345 --> 05:15.673
Good group, right?

05:16.180 --> 05:18.089
I would like to hear them, please.

05:18.307 --> 05:19.849
I am sorry.

05:37.074 --> 05:40.573
- Great music, right?
- Yes i like it.

05:41.912 --> 05:43.406
Do you mind if I buy you a drink?

05:43.622 --> 05:45.530
- No thanks.
- I would like to do it.

05:45.915 --> 05:47.742
No thanks.

06:27.912 --> 06:31.530
- Who was that woman?
- I do not know.

06:32.125 --> 06:36.371
- What did he said?
- Nothing. Will you pay me the bill? Thank you.

06:36.587 --> 06:37.785
Wait.

07:21.711 --> 07:24.416
- Hello.
- Because you follow me?

07:24.630 --> 07:26.872
You left very quickly and I do
not know how to contact you.

07:27.091 --> 07:29.761
- I would like to see you again.
- It's not possible.

07:29.969 --> 07:31.629
Wait.

07:32.929 --> 07:35.337
Let me talk to you for a while.

07:35.557 --> 07:37.763
I just want to go with you.

07:38.560 --> 07:40.718
You should not be alone
on such a night.

07:41.354 --> 07:43.928
- Am I safe with you?
Yes.

07:44.191 --> 07:47.772
I know that woman has disturbed you.
Maybe you want to talk to someone.

07:48.819 --> 07:50.693
Come on.
Is it around here?

07:51.614 --> 07:53.606
Agree?

07:58.703 --> 08:00.743
TIOVIVO 15 CENTS

08:03.708 --> 08:05.499
This is where I live.

08:09.171 --> 08:11.496
It's a merry-go-round!

08:17.012 --> 08:19.717
Do you live inside
a wooden horse?

08:19.973 --> 08:21.003
Do not.

08:21.223 --> 08:24.011
My apartment is up there.

08:25.061 --> 08:28.097
It must be very noisy, with the
merry-go-round underneath.

08:29.315 --> 08:30.774
Sometimes.

08:30.983 --> 08:33.438
But I love music.

08:34.068 --> 08:36.738
- It reminds me...
- Childhood?

08:37.780 --> 08:39.239
Yes.

08:39.908 --> 08:41.568
Good...

08:41.909 --> 08:43.570
- Goodnight.
- Wait.

08:43.785 --> 08:46.787
I do not even know your name.
My name is Johnny.

08:47.247 --> 08:48.907
My name is Mora.

08:52.586 --> 08:55.457
Are not you going to
invite me up for a while?

08:57.423 --> 08:59.961
- I gotta get in.
- Just a moment.

09:01.636 --> 09:02.916
Good night, Johnny.

09:15.357 --> 09:16.851
Hey, Mora.

09:18.485 --> 09:20.560
Can i see you tomorrow?

09:20.778 --> 09:22.901
Please.

09:24.490 --> 09:25.688
Agree.

09:27.576 --> 09:29.118
I'll cook you breakfast.

09:29.495 --> 09:30.954
OK what time?

09:31.537 --> 09:32.866
About eleven?

09:33.581 --> 09:34.992
I'll be here at eleven.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.207
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

10:17.622 --> 10:19.614
- Good Morning.
- Good Morning.

10:19.832 --> 10:22.073
- Is the merry-go-round open?
- So is.

10:22.292 --> 10:24.332
Sunday is our big day.

10:24.878 --> 10:27.085
What beautiful horses.
Can I see them?

10:27.297 --> 10:29.373
- Of course. Go ahead, son.
- Thank you.

10:29.591 --> 10:31.832
Watching is free.

10:33.970 --> 10:36.461
They are carved by hand.

10:36.681 --> 10:38.720
Shipped from Bavaria.

10:38.933 --> 10:41.388
Most people do not appreciate
how special they are.

10:41.602 --> 10:43.641
They are the best in the country.

10:43.853 --> 10:45.680
- Good morning, Grandpa.
- Good morning, Ellen.

10:45.897 --> 10:49.266
He showed this young man
our magnificent horses.

10:49.484 --> 10:52.604
Sorry...
She's my granddaughter, Ellen.

10:53.655 --> 10:56.571
- What's your name, son?
- Johnny Drake, how's it going?

10:57.157 --> 11:00.526
- Do you have the key to the box?
- Yes, I have it somewhere.

11:02.413 --> 11:04.286
Fine thanks.

11:05.249 --> 11:08.118
I have to go upstairs.
See you around.

11:09.293 --> 11:12.413
- Precious horses.
- Who are you going to visit?

11:12.797 --> 11:16.546
- A girl named Mora.
- To Mora?

11:17.468 --> 11:20.172
I have not seen you here before.

11:20.512 --> 11:24.557
Did you just meet
her, or something?

11:26.017 --> 11:29.766
No, I've known her for a while.

11:30.980 --> 11:32.604
See you around.

11:32.815 --> 11:35.021
Good...
See you soon, son.

11:35.359 --> 11:36.770
Yes...

12:32.369 --> 12:35.406
- Yes? Who?
- It's me, Johnny.

12:40.836 --> 12:42.413
- Good Morning.
- Good Morning.

12:42.628 --> 12:44.835
- Pass.
- Thank you.

12:45.757 --> 12:47.334
How are you?

12:47.633 --> 12:50.041
- Very good.
- All right.

12:59.186 --> 13:01.759
- Your house is very good.
- Thank you.

13:03.315 --> 13:05.769
I collect things from the sea.

13:06.567 --> 13:08.310
I can see that.

13:08.527 --> 13:11.279
- Can I have your hat?
- Thank you.

13:13.699 --> 13:15.324
Are you hungry?

13:15.659 --> 13:17.450
- A lot.
- All right.

13:17.660 --> 13:20.697
Breakfast is ready.
I have it on the balcony.

13:20.914 --> 13:21.914
- All right.
- Come on.

13:22.123 --> 13:25.077
- Where is the balcony?
- This way.

13:34.259 --> 13:35.837
- Blackberry!
- Yes?

13:36.053 --> 13:38.176
You have great views.

13:38.388 --> 13:41.092
Thank you.
I love them.

13:58.698 --> 14:01.616
- Toast.
- Agree.

14:02.911 --> 14:04.453
Atu salud, mine...

14:04.661 --> 14:06.654
And the beautiful Pacific.

14:07.498 --> 14:09.455
For us, Johnny.

14:16.756 --> 14:18.547
I hope you like the fish

14:18.841 --> 14:21.926
This morning I found
this mackerel so fresh.

14:33.396 --> 14:35.270
I love everything that
comes from the ocean,

14:35.482 --> 14:37.937
Especially the lobster, the
crab and the sea urchin.

14:38.151 --> 14:40.985
- Have you tried the sea urchin?
- Never.

14:41.278 --> 14:43.520
It's like a wonderful sea fruit.

14:43.739 --> 14:47.404
- It is eaten like a grenade.
- I would like to try it.

14:47.618 --> 14:50.868
They do not abound around here, but
I think I know where to get them.

14:51.330 --> 14:54.698
- Next time, maybe?
- Agree.

15:09.846 --> 15:11.638
What do you do?

15:11.848 --> 15:14.339
- I mean, if you work.
- If I work.

15:15.268 --> 15:18.471
- In fact, today I have to work.
- On Sunday?

15:18.938 --> 15:20.480
What is your job?

15:20.689 --> 15:23.263
Did not my name ring
when I told you?

15:23.776 --> 15:25.021
Do not.

15:26.987 --> 15:29.394
I work at the dock fair.

15:29.864 --> 15:32.402
- I'm an attraction.
- You are a dancer?

15:32.617 --> 15:34.277
Do not.

15:34.494 --> 15:36.202
Do baseball balls hit you?

15:36.412 --> 15:39.164
- Yes?
- Do not.

15:39.374 --> 15:41.164
My work is not dangerous.

15:41.375 --> 15:42.620
I give up, what are you doing?

15:42.835 --> 15:44.080
I'm a mermaid.

15:44.920 --> 15:46.083
Are you what?

15:46.296 --> 15:49.416
A mermaid, half
woman, half fish.

15:50.259 --> 15:51.338
I do not get it.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.093
It's very simple.

15:53.302 --> 15:55.046
I get a fish tail

15:55.263 --> 15:58.098
And I'm in a tank that
looks full of water.

15:58.307 --> 16:01.012
And people pay 25
cents to see me.

16:01.227 --> 16:03.385
This is how I make a living.

16:04.813 --> 16:06.936
Do not you get tired of doing that?

16:07.357 --> 16:09.065
Sometimes.

16:09.401 --> 16:11.061
But it's a very quiet job.

16:12.737 --> 16:15.607
I've told you about
me, what about you?

16:17.616 --> 16:20.783
I am a member of the US Navy.

16:21.704 --> 16:23.364
Do you really want to know?

16:23.580 --> 16:25.703
Yes.
- Good...

16:28.710 --> 16:30.501
My mother...

16:32.088 --> 16:35.291
My father abandoned my mother
when I was very young.

16:37.009 --> 16:39.464
So I was very close to her.

16:40.262 --> 16:44.176
I had always wanted to see the world
and I did not have the opportunity.

16:46.643 --> 16:49.051
Then my mother fell ill and...

16:49.563 --> 16:50.972
died.

16:51.981 --> 16:55.397
And I thought the best way
out of Denver was the Navy.

16:55.609 --> 16:56.854
See the world.

16:57.695 --> 17:00.400
- But for the moment I have not seen anything.
- You will see.

17:00.865 --> 17:02.145
I hope so.

17:15.711 --> 17:17.999
- Are you going to finish your meal?
- Do not.

17:18.213 --> 17:21.000
They are attracted to the food on your plate.

17:23.050 --> 17:25.090
Look at that.

17:27.680 --> 17:28.960
Watch them.

17:29.181 --> 17:30.759
One will come to you.

17:30.975 --> 17:33.300
They are becoming more and more daring.

17:47.198 --> 17:49.025
I will not hurt you.

17:50.784 --> 17:54.070
"I surprised you, did not I?"
- Where did you learn to do that?

17:54.955 --> 17:56.615
I do not remember.

17:56.832 --> 17:59.323
Probably on the island where I was born.

18:00.627 --> 18:03.544
Calm calm.
Do not be afraid, little bird.

18:03.755 --> 18:05.546
I will not hurt you.

18:09.010 --> 18:12.130
Sweet bird, do not be afraid.

18:25.066 --> 18:27.473
- I like them.
- Look! My poster.

18:30.571 --> 18:34.485
- Are you supposed to be?
- Yes, when I wear my disguise.

18:34.742 --> 18:36.450
Wow, this I have to see.

18:36.660 --> 18:37.988
You will see.

18:39.495 --> 18:41.535
- Where's Sam?
- Who's Sam?

18:41.748 --> 18:44.583
The owner of the attraction.
My boss, as you would say.

18:44.792 --> 18:46.832
- Are not you afraid people will see you?
- Do not.

18:47.045 --> 18:50.911
They do not pay attention to the
booth until Sam releases his tirade.

19:04.602 --> 19:08.386
"I hired you, Captain Murdock.
- I apologize.

19:09.065 --> 19:10.974
I was thinking, my dear...

19:11.192 --> 19:15.235
Yes, I was meditating on
certain important issues

19:15.445 --> 19:18.896
In the calm of a summer afternoon.

19:19.491 --> 19:22.990
- Why are you so late?
- It's not too late either.

19:24.370 --> 19:25.780
Go prepare.

19:25.996 --> 19:28.202
Yes, but first I want to
introduce you to a friend.

19:28.457 --> 19:30.699
This is Johnny Drake.
Captain Murdock.

19:30.918 --> 19:33.587
- Charmed.
- How are you.

19:33.796 --> 19:36.121
Be prepared while the
amplifier heats up.

19:36.340 --> 19:38.912
- I'm going to get dressed, I'll let you know.
- Do not delay.

19:39.133 --> 19:40.627
Do not.

19:42.512 --> 19:45.003
How hot it is today, huh?

19:46.224 --> 19:48.631
Yes a lot.

19:49.768 --> 19:53.433
That attraction should leave you
well shaken. Have you climbed on it?

19:53.855 --> 19:57.520
No, I have enough
to see her all day.

19:59.527 --> 20:01.400
Tell me, young man...

20:01.820 --> 20:03.979
How long have you been
sailing the seas?

20:04.573 --> 20:07.444
Very little, as far as
I've gone is Hawaii.

20:07.993 --> 20:10.365
- I'm destined for San Pedro.
- It's a shame.

20:10.579 --> 20:14.907
I thought we could remember,
exchange stories of sailors.

20:15.291 --> 20:18.162
I am retired but I was in
the service of His Majesty.

20:18.378 --> 20:21.996
- You mean the British navy?
- That's right, the British navy.

20:22.215 --> 20:24.706
Later, I was captain
of my own boat.

20:24.925 --> 20:28.341
So I found it, on
one of my trips.

20:28.637 --> 20:32.136
- You mean Mora?
- Yes, I may have told you.

20:32.349 --> 20:35.433
No, he just told me
something about an island.

20:35.644 --> 20:40.720
You may be interested in that story.
It is very rare.

20:41.649 --> 20:44.021
I would like you to
visit me sometime.

20:44.235 --> 20:47.401
Maybe some weekend where
you have permission.

20:47.613 --> 20:50.150
Yes, there is no hurry.

20:50.365 --> 20:52.404
Look, I'll give you my card.

20:52.617 --> 20:54.159
I am currently in Venice.

20:54.369 --> 20:59.825
It lacks the grandeur of its Italian
homonym, but it has its charm.

21:00.582 --> 21:02.409
Captain Samuel Murdock.
Yes.

21:02.626 --> 21:04.619
I'm ready, Johnny!

21:04.837 --> 21:07.328
- Well, we'll see you around.
- Yes Yes.

21:07.548 --> 21:09.255
- Bye.
- Bye.

21:21.435 --> 21:25.479
Mora, ladies and gentlemen,
Mora the mermaid.

21:25.689 --> 21:30.101
Look at the strangest creature
that lives in captivity.

21:30.318 --> 21:32.643
See how he lives underwater.

21:32.862 --> 21:35.188
Half woman, half fish.

21:35.407 --> 21:40.114
The strangest creature that lives
in captivity. For 25 cents.

21:40.327 --> 21:44.076
For a quarter of a dollar.
The experience of your life.

21:44.289 --> 21:48.156
Only 25 cents.
The mermaid...

22:21.907 --> 22:26.699
The bus coming from San Pedro,
Wilmington, Long Beach and Los Angeles

22:26.911 --> 22:29.200
Arrives at the moment
to the door 1.

22:31.291 --> 22:33.746
Santa Monica Station.

23:13.287 --> 23:15.078
Goodnight.

23:15.956 --> 23:18.910
- You are going to sleep?
- Do not.

23:19.293 --> 23:22.543
- You do not want to go swimming?
- I'll go later.

23:22.755 --> 23:25.126
If I go now, my digestion
will be cut off.

23:25.756 --> 23:29.042
- I've never believed such a thing.
- Well, it's true.

23:29.260 --> 23:33.009
It is very dangerous to get into
the water right after eating.

23:34.223 --> 23:35.716
Can.

23:44.399 --> 23:47.067
- Mora, what about this Sam?
- Sam?

23:47.276 --> 23:48.651
Yes.

23:49.028 --> 23:51.269
Nothing, what do you mean?

23:51.655 --> 23:55.107
I mean, what's the story?
Who?

23:56.827 --> 23:59.364
You've been thinking about him, have not you?

24:00.038 --> 24:01.746
Let's say yes.

24:02.373 --> 24:04.615
I thought he was a weird old man.

24:07.170 --> 24:09.458
He's just a lonely old man.

24:13.592 --> 24:15.383
Do you know him well?

24:16.261 --> 24:17.672
Quite.

24:18.305 --> 24:20.132
He is my employer.

24:21.141 --> 24:23.631
Sometimes I think he's my only friend.

24:24.352 --> 24:26.309
What about me?

24:26.520 --> 24:28.098
You, of course.

24:30.858 --> 24:33.016
You do not know me much.

24:33.778 --> 24:35.769
Maybe when you get to know me...

24:36.154 --> 24:38.028
I think I know you pretty well.

24:38.239 --> 24:40.362
In our third meeting?

24:41.993 --> 24:45.409
No. But I would like
you to know me better.

24:46.246 --> 24:48.405
That does not scare me.

24:48.624 --> 24:50.747
Why should I give it to you?

24:53.420 --> 24:56.789
Tell me, did Sam tell you anything about me?

24:58.132 --> 25:00.967
That he found you on an island.

25:02.595 --> 25:04.054
So is.

25:04.555 --> 25:07.971
I was an orphan on the
island of Mykonos.

25:08.309 --> 25:10.929
She was just a child,
and he adopted me.

25:11.144 --> 25:13.220
- You mean it's you...?
- My guardian.

25:13.772 --> 25:15.895
He's been like a father to
me, I owe him everything.

25:16.942 --> 25:19.230
Sorry, I had not noticed.

25:22.112 --> 25:24.782
If I said something unkind
about him, I'm sorry.

25:24.990 --> 25:26.568
Nothing happens.

25:27.910 --> 25:30.365
I know he's a strange man.

25:31.205 --> 25:34.655
But he has been very good
to me, and I am grateful.

25:35.667 --> 25:39.878
And I know you can understand it from
what you told me about your mother.

25:40.797 --> 25:43.252
- Do you want more coffee?
- I would love to.

26:02.942 --> 26:05.777
- You like the sun, huh?
Yes.

26:05.986 --> 26:07.896
Sun...

26:08.155 --> 26:10.277
And the moon and the stars...

26:10.490 --> 26:11.652
And the sea.

26:14.118 --> 26:16.111
Yes, the sea.

26:17.080 --> 26:19.535
I think that's what
I like most of all.

26:20.083 --> 26:22.489
And I fear it too.

26:27.130 --> 26:30.131
I guess we all
fear what we love.

26:32.678 --> 26:35.168
- Hey, Mora.
- Yes?

26:37.223 --> 26:39.262
You're awfully far away.

27:25.350 --> 27:27.758
Hey, Mora, do you
want to dance for us?

29:41.224 --> 29:43.346
- Johnny...
- You're good?

29:43.559 --> 29:46.809
- I'm fine.
- Stay a little like this, it's okay.

29:47.438 --> 29:48.601
- You're good?
Yes.

29:48.814 --> 29:51.103
Can you throw a little back?

29:51.901 --> 29:53.276
- You're good?
Yes.

29:53.486 --> 29:56.272
It was for that woman, right?

29:56.863 --> 29:58.441
What woman?

30:17.341 --> 30:20.543
- Your coffee, Grandpa.
- Thanks sweetie.

30:24.263 --> 30:27.430
- Hello!
- Hello, how are you?

30:29.018 --> 30:32.516
- Thank you dear.
- We're having tea, will you?

30:32.729 --> 30:34.271
I was going to have a coffee.

30:34.481 --> 30:37.601
Take it here, I said tea,
but I've also made coffee.

30:37.817 --> 30:41.021
Madame Romanovitch is the
only one who drinks tea.

30:43.656 --> 30:45.198
What's up, boy?

30:45.699 --> 30:48.784
- Hello, how are you?
- Very good.

30:48.994 --> 30:51.568
- I'm glad.
- Sit down, young man.

30:53.999 --> 30:57.830
What an appalling
invention, tea bags.

30:58.211 --> 31:01.377
If everyone insisted
on using them,

31:01.589 --> 31:05.836
I could never read the grounds
again, would I, young man?

31:06.052 --> 31:09.052
- I suppose not.
- In my case, it does not matter.

31:09.262 --> 31:11.588
I can not read my
own grounds either.

31:11.807 --> 31:15.591
Guessors can never.
You can see the ones from all over the world,

31:15.811 --> 31:17.850
But not their own.

31:18.063 --> 31:21.810
- Sometimes frustrating.
- It must be.

31:22.733 --> 31:24.975
- The coffee.
- Thank you.

31:31.824 --> 31:33.901
How long have you been in the Navy?

31:34.786 --> 31:36.909
A little more than a year.

31:39.541 --> 31:41.663
What part of the country are you from?

31:42.209 --> 31:44.166
I'm from Denver, Colorado.

31:44.836 --> 31:49.831
- I've never been to the coast.
- Then you're a visitor here.

31:50.759 --> 31:52.752
Yes, I suppose I am.

31:53.595 --> 31:55.302
I like this.

31:55.513 --> 31:57.920
When I leave the Navy, I
would like to settle here.

31:58.140 --> 31:59.884
- Hello friends.
- Hello.

32:00.476 --> 32:02.765
Grandfather, it's Lieutenant Henderson.

32:02.979 --> 32:05.267
Hello, how are you, Lieutenant?

32:05.481 --> 32:07.686
- All right.
- Would you like a cup of coffee?

32:07.899 --> 32:09.139
No thanks, I can not stay.

32:09.734 --> 32:13.234
You have not seen anything
new or strange, have you?

32:13.446 --> 32:16.198
- Not me, and you, Grandpa?
- Do not.

32:16.991 --> 32:18.568
How are you, Lieutenant?

32:18.784 --> 32:21.239
Do you have new leads?

32:21.453 --> 32:22.616
Can.

32:22.830 --> 32:24.656
We are not sure yet.

32:24.873 --> 32:26.284
We do not have much.

32:26.500 --> 32:28.409
It's good to know that
they have not given up.

32:29.545 --> 32:31.417
Well, I have to go.

32:31.629 --> 32:33.954
- See you soon.
- Bye, Lieutenant.

32:34.173 --> 32:35.204
Bye.

32:35.675 --> 32:37.383
What was this about?

32:37.760 --> 32:40.132
It was Lieutenant Henderson,
of the Venice police.

32:40.346 --> 32:41.923
I was asking about Mora.

32:42.931 --> 32:44.674
What about Mora?

32:45.976 --> 32:49.973
- You're a stranger and I suppose not...
- Ellen, my dear.

32:50.188 --> 32:51.848
You're meddling.

32:52.065 --> 32:55.231
But I think someone should
tell you, right, Grandpa?

32:55.442 --> 32:58.527
Of course.
It's no secret.

33:01.448 --> 33:05.232
In the last two years, Mora has
had two boyfriends who have died.

33:06.286 --> 33:08.444
And the police think she
has something to do?

33:08.663 --> 33:12.079
- Nothing has been tested.
- Not yet.

33:12.375 --> 33:15.874
But do not you think it's
enough that it happened twice?

33:16.087 --> 33:18.209
They were both good guys.

33:18.422 --> 33:20.165
They went out with her.

33:20.590 --> 33:23.212
And suddenly they disappeared.

33:23.427 --> 33:25.882
A few days later, they
found their corpses.

33:26.221 --> 33:28.973
The current dragged
them to shore, drowned.

33:30.391 --> 33:35.931
But nothing indicates that it was
not an unfortunate coincidence.

33:36.147 --> 33:38.602
The police have not been
able to arrest anyone.

33:38.816 --> 33:43.691
Either it was her, or it brings
bad luck, which is almost as bad.

33:44.362 --> 33:47.031
I'm sure he did not tell you
about those kids, did not he?

33:53.662 --> 33:54.860
Say it? It's the merry-go-round.

33:55.080 --> 33:56.907
We want to get on the merry-go-round.

33:57.124 --> 33:59.282
Agree.
I'll be right back.

34:01.962 --> 34:03.836
I waited.
Hey, sailor.

34:04.047 --> 34:05.457
Is for you.

34:05.673 --> 34:08.045
Thats weird.
No one knows I'm here.

34:15.558 --> 34:17.016
Say it?

34:18.226 --> 34:19.226
Say it?

34:20.812 --> 34:22.141
Say it?

34:34.742 --> 34:36.366
Who was?

34:37.745 --> 34:39.868
I do not know.

34:40.996 --> 34:44.199
Something has come out for me, I have to go.
Thanks for the coffee.

34:48.338 --> 34:49.880
Wait a minute, young man!

34:52.632 --> 34:54.672
Come and see me.

34:54.926 --> 34:57.334
The letters will tell you many things.

37:15.513 --> 37:17.173
Have you seen a woman pass by?

38:21.115 --> 38:25.860
Well, what a joyful surprise.
Ahead.

38:26.786 --> 38:27.817
Good...

38:28.037 --> 38:31.240
You have finally decided to
honor me with your visit.

38:32.125 --> 38:35.410
Yes, we were talking about my protégé.

38:35.962 --> 38:37.290
Good...

38:37.588 --> 38:42.962
What I have to tell you is difficult
to explain, especially to a young man.

38:43.593 --> 38:47.176
I feel that young people today
form their views on life

38:47.514 --> 38:49.839
Too soon, and it
should not be so.

38:50.057 --> 38:51.468
But you may be different.

38:51.684 --> 38:53.427
What was he going to tell me about Mora?

38:53.644 --> 38:56.396
Oh, Lord, you may
not be different.

38:56.605 --> 39:00.057
Patience is a virtue, young
man, you should learn that.

39:00.276 --> 39:03.644
But in fact...

39:04.028 --> 39:07.279
What I have to say is
difficult to express.

39:07.490 --> 39:10.195
At least in a way that
you can understand.

39:10.577 --> 39:14.573
In any case, the basic fact
can be expressed bluntly.

39:15.330 --> 39:19.909
As long as you continue to see
Mora, you are in grave danger.

39:20.586 --> 39:24.286
- The danger comes from you?
- Absolutely.

39:24.506 --> 39:28.254
- Then what are you talking about?
- De Mora, my friend.

39:29.510 --> 39:33.555
- He must be crazy.
- On the contrary, I am well sane.

39:33.764 --> 39:36.172
Mora is a danger to you.

39:36.434 --> 39:37.843
How?

39:38.268 --> 39:39.643
Good...

39:39.853 --> 39:41.727
Let's say...

39:42.606 --> 39:45.690
Suffers a certain obsession

39:46.109 --> 39:49.773
- that can lead to killing you.
"You mean she's crazy?"

39:49.987 --> 39:53.023
Not exactly, but you'd
better believe he is.

39:53.240 --> 39:55.233
I wish you believed me.

39:55.451 --> 39:59.199
Break up with this relationship
before it's too late.

40:00.080 --> 40:02.866
You're a nice young man, I do not
want to see how they hurt you.

40:05.501 --> 40:11.421
Can you bring another bottle of this
splendid liquor from that cupboard?

40:20.307 --> 40:24.601
Since you're there, turn on the light,
it's starting to get dark in here.

40:31.233 --> 40:33.226
The one at the end.

40:36.447 --> 40:38.355
On the shelf below.

40:44.954 --> 40:48.370
Do not be alarmed, it's
just an Arabic souvenir.

40:48.583 --> 40:49.582
The hand of a thief.

40:49.875 --> 40:54.620
The Mohammedans punish thieves
by cutting off their hands.

40:55.005 --> 40:58.089
A bit truculent, but
logical, do not you think?

40:58.342 --> 40:59.587
How did you get it?

41:05.264 --> 41:10.887
Of the Sultan of Marrakech, who knew
that I collected strange things

41:11.103 --> 41:13.772
And had the attention of sending it to me.

41:18.526 --> 41:20.186
Yes.

41:21.071 --> 41:24.190
- It is very interesting.
- Do you want another?

41:26.283 --> 41:30.328
- You drink a lot, do not you?
- Maybe for your young eyes,

41:30.537 --> 41:34.321
But at my age one needs a little
stimulation, you'll understand.

41:34.541 --> 41:36.450
He was going to tell me more about Mora.

41:37.460 --> 41:40.081
Yes, yes, it was going to...

41:40.296 --> 41:43.463
You will have read about
Greek mythology, right?

41:43.925 --> 41:44.956
Do not.

41:45.468 --> 41:47.460
You will know the legend of the sirens,

41:47.678 --> 41:51.841
Which in ancient times attracted
the sailors and destroyed them.

41:52.057 --> 41:53.516
Yes, I heard.

41:54.726 --> 42:00.348
The sirens were a people of the
sea, half human, half fish.

42:00.564 --> 42:05.725
In English popularly it is called
to its females "" mermaids "",

42:05.945 --> 42:08.352
Which means "" ladies of the sea "".

42:08.572 --> 42:10.695
It's like that...

42:10.908 --> 42:14.110
- representation of yours and of Mora.
- Exactly.

42:14.327 --> 42:16.450
But that is false, you know?

42:16.871 --> 42:18.663
A fair attraction.

42:18.873 --> 42:22.741
But you do not think they
really exist, do you?

42:24.503 --> 42:26.495
No I dont think so.

42:26.964 --> 42:30.415
Let me tell you that there are
things that happen in this world

42:30.634 --> 42:33.207
That your philosophy has
not even dreamed of.

42:33.762 --> 42:37.462
Where do you think the myths come from?
Do you think they are inventions?

42:37.682 --> 42:39.721
No, they come from reality!

42:40.267 --> 42:43.103
An ancient, living reality!

42:43.312 --> 42:46.064
What does all this
have to do with Mora?

42:48.149 --> 42:50.272
It was a sweet little thing.

42:50.610 --> 42:52.650
He lived here with me.

42:53.613 --> 42:54.644
Up there.

42:55.740 --> 42:57.614
That was his room.

42:59.077 --> 43:00.451
Behind that door.

43:02.496 --> 43:03.907
I found her...

43:04.498 --> 43:06.656
I found it on an island.

43:07.709 --> 43:10.461
Then he did not know
what he would become.

43:11.629 --> 43:12.827
Become?

43:14.966 --> 43:18.798
I did not know that she belonged
to that ancestral race.

43:20.221 --> 43:21.300
It's a monster!

43:23.265 --> 43:25.590
If you do not stop seeing...

43:27.936 --> 43:29.478
I warned you.

43:29.980 --> 43:31.806
That's all I can do.

43:34.192 --> 43:36.065
Tell me one thing...

43:37.403 --> 43:38.731
Captain Murdock.

43:40.698 --> 43:43.402
There's a woman who's
been bothering Mora.

43:43.701 --> 43:45.278
I think he's here.

43:45.786 --> 43:47.576
I just want to talk to her.

43:48.413 --> 43:49.693
A woman?

43:50.289 --> 43:52.247
There is no woman.

43:53.418 --> 43:55.576
I am alone.

43:57.755 --> 43:59.996
Captain Murd...
Captain Murdock!

44:01.675 --> 44:03.003
Mr!

45:15.784 --> 45:17.741
I did not want you to know.

45:20.330 --> 45:23.864
He did well to tell you, but
I did not want you to know.

45:32.341 --> 45:35.507
I guess I will not see you again.

45:36.470 --> 45:38.842
You will not believe I
believed you, would you? "

45:39.055 --> 45:40.929
But it's the truth, Johnny.

45:41.516 --> 45:44.138
They wait for me to join them.

45:46.604 --> 45:48.513
You've seen one of them.

45:52.067 --> 45:54.107
You mean that woman?

45:55.654 --> 45:57.446
You saw how he looked at me,

45:57.655 --> 45:59.280
How he talked to me

46:00.533 --> 46:02.158
It is one of them.

46:04.787 --> 46:07.824
She is one of the sea creatures
and has come to remind me

46:08.041 --> 46:11.124
The moment when I shall
join them in the sea.

46:32.438 --> 46:34.145
Listen, Mora.

46:35.607 --> 46:38.561
I do not know how or where
you got those ideas,

46:38.985 --> 46:40.729
But they are not true.

46:41.696 --> 46:43.819
These things do not happen.

46:46.742 --> 46:48.734
Johnny, I wish they did not happen.

46:48.952 --> 46:51.408
Wish they were impossible.

46:54.792 --> 46:58.575
Americans have such a
simple view of the world...

46:59.212 --> 47:03.541
You believe that everything can be
seen, touched, weighed and measured.

47:05.676 --> 47:08.132
You believe that you
have discovered reality,

47:08.346 --> 47:10.800
But you do not even know what it is.

47:14.351 --> 47:17.850
You mean that everything
Sam told me is true?

47:18.438 --> 47:20.063
Most.

47:22.066 --> 47:23.809
Tell me, how do you know?

47:39.666 --> 47:43.331
Because I feel the sea water
running through my veins.

47:44.003 --> 47:48.545
I hear the roar of the sea and it speaks
to me like the voice of a mother.

47:50.133 --> 47:52.920
The tide pulls my heart.

47:54.680 --> 47:58.759
The face of the moon fills my
soul with a strange nostalgia.

48:00.017 --> 48:01.215
Blackberry...

48:03.229 --> 48:04.509
I do not get it.

48:19.410 --> 48:20.987
Listen out.

48:21.620 --> 48:23.494
Try to understand

48:24.498 --> 48:26.407
And forgive me.

48:36.008 --> 48:39.673
I have not heard a conch
shell since I was a kid.

48:40.263 --> 48:43.050
My grandmother had one
on top of her dresser.

48:47.310 --> 48:49.718
Sounds like the sea, right?

48:53.817 --> 48:56.686
When I traveled to this
country from Greece,

48:57.736 --> 49:00.571
I brought a conch shell with me.

49:01.573 --> 49:05.073
That way I always had
the sea next to me.

49:06.370 --> 49:07.485
Always close.

49:10.748 --> 49:12.955
Johnny, I'm so scared.

49:14.043 --> 49:16.119
Do not be afraid.

49:22.801 --> 49:27.130
Look, I do not know what this is all about.

49:28.557 --> 49:31.806
But I know I'm here and
we'll figure this out.

49:33.727 --> 49:34.972
Hug me.

49:35.938 --> 49:37.516
Hug me.

50:00.502 --> 50:02.993
My dear boy.

50:04.965 --> 50:08.463
I hope you do not mind,
but I wanted you to come.

50:08.676 --> 50:12.045
I wanted it very much and
I'm glad it was fulfilled.

50:12.263 --> 50:13.342
Really?

50:14.015 --> 50:18.973
I know you have a very serious
problem, and I will try to help you.

50:21.354 --> 50:23.098
Thank you, thank you.

50:23.315 --> 50:28.391
When I have written the letters,
it will be time to thank me.

50:29.988 --> 50:32.774
How much is your work worth?

50:33.198 --> 50:35.524
Two dollars.

50:36.535 --> 50:39.986
- You can afford them, right?
- If it is okay.

50:48.296 --> 50:51.166
Have they ever hit you?

50:51.799 --> 50:54.088
I've never visited a fortune teller.

50:54.302 --> 50:56.756
Do not use that word, guess what.

50:58.346 --> 50:59.675
It is so vulgar.

51:00.348 --> 51:04.393
I prefer to be called a
quiromantic or psychic.

51:04.603 --> 51:08.267
First we must find the
letter that represents you.

51:15.321 --> 51:19.732
If it's your first time, chances
are you've never seen these cards.

51:19.949 --> 51:21.064
Do not.

51:21.284 --> 51:24.617
The modern deck of cards
is based on this one.

51:24.829 --> 51:29.041
But most symbolic letters
have been excluded.

51:29.626 --> 51:33.076
Here you are!
The horse of drinks.

51:34.546 --> 51:35.625
Because I'm?

51:36.131 --> 51:39.666
Because it represents a pure young man,

51:40.260 --> 51:42.631
Innocent and looking for answers.

51:49.602 --> 51:52.271
Look at these letters, young man.

51:52.480 --> 51:55.433
They contain all the
secrets of the Universe.

51:55.648 --> 51:58.982
How can a deck contain all
the secrets of the Universe?

51:59.194 --> 52:00.937
Each letter is a symbol.

52:01.154 --> 52:04.440
Properly connected,
these symbols

52:04.657 --> 52:06.614
Contain all human wisdom.

52:06.825 --> 52:10.194
- Like a coded message.
- Exactly.

52:10.412 --> 52:14.244
Well, this is what contradicts you:
This, what crowns you:

52:14.458 --> 52:16.082
This, what is under you:

52:16.293 --> 52:17.952
This, what is behind you:

52:18.169 --> 52:20.327
What you have in front of you

52:20.546 --> 52:24.626
This is you, your house,
your hopes and fears

52:24.842 --> 52:27.962
And this is your future.

52:30.597 --> 52:33.633
- What do you see?
- How weird!

52:33.850 --> 52:37.634
- What?
- Here are some lunar aspects.

52:37.854 --> 52:42.314
The letter of the Moon represents
the journey to the unknown.

52:42.900 --> 52:46.767
The dog and the wolf symbolize
the fears of the mind,

52:46.987 --> 52:49.692
Our deep and
primitive instincts.

52:50.824 --> 52:56.612
Do you see that the crab tries to
jump from the water to the earth?

52:57.205 --> 52:59.874
But it almost always sinks again.

53:00.416 --> 53:03.453
- What does that mean?
- Do not be impatient.

53:04.128 --> 53:08.670
I do not want to make a mistake,
my job can be disastrous.

53:09.716 --> 53:14.295
Unfortunately, the letter of the
Moon is next to the one of the Hung.

53:14.971 --> 53:17.011
What does the Hangman mean?

53:18.724 --> 53:21.180
It is a letter of deep meaning.

53:22.353 --> 53:26.481
The figure shows the
suspended life.

53:28.150 --> 53:31.352
The letter of Martyrdom has
often been falsely called.

53:31.736 --> 53:34.856
But martyrdom implies suffering,

53:35.865 --> 53:39.483
And if you look at the
face of the figure,

53:40.119 --> 53:44.199
You will see that it has an
expression of deep trance.

53:44.748 --> 53:48.247
This letter shows that a
great awakening is possible.

53:51.046 --> 53:53.251
And reminds us

53:53.756 --> 53:57.374
That after the sacred
mystery of death

53:58.344 --> 54:02.970
There is the glorious mystery
of the resurrection.

54:05.225 --> 54:07.514
And is it good or bad?

54:07.978 --> 54:12.770
Dear, letters do not lend
themselves to over-simplification.

54:14.025 --> 54:15.401
And what about Mora?

54:18.278 --> 54:20.948
I'm afraid she's stuck in...

54:21.615 --> 54:23.904
A whirlwind of evil.

54:27.329 --> 54:29.120
And you...

54:29.872 --> 54:32.992
It saddens me to tell you,
but you are in danger.

54:33.209 --> 54:36.543
- A serious danger.
- What kind of danger?

54:37.296 --> 54:41.210
That's a question you
do not need to ask me.

54:42.426 --> 54:47.253
The answer lies in your heart already.

54:56.147 --> 54:59.350
I would not give too many turns
to what a fortune teller says.

54:59.567 --> 55:00.765
I do not do it.

55:01.569 --> 55:03.976
Only when you hear something
over and over again,

55:04.196 --> 55:06.354
After a while you end
up believing it.

55:06.573 --> 55:08.316
You said things about Mora.

55:08.533 --> 55:10.609
What do you really know?

55:12.537 --> 55:15.657
I'm sorry for what I said the other afternoon.

55:15.915 --> 55:18.322
I should not have intruded.

55:18.542 --> 55:22.955
I told you what I read in the newspaper
because I thought you should know.

55:25.591 --> 55:27.797
I just can not believe that...

55:31.929 --> 55:33.969
Have you fallen in love with her?

55:35.391 --> 55:36.636
Yes.

55:39.228 --> 55:41.267
I miss the love

55:41.479 --> 55:45.347
Is that it can arrive suddenly,
you know what I mean?

55:47.318 --> 55:48.398
As...

55:48.903 --> 55:50.813
When you are alone.

55:51.947 --> 55:54.734
Or when you've been
looking for someone.

55:57.828 --> 56:00.153
I do not know what I can do for her.

56:01.749 --> 56:03.456
She believes it too.

56:03.666 --> 56:05.824
What?
Who killed those kids?

56:06.043 --> 56:07.703
No no...

56:08.337 --> 56:10.663
I can not explain it to you.

56:14.051 --> 56:16.458
Try not to worry about it.

56:16.678 --> 56:20.177
Things may turn out
better than you think.

56:22.058 --> 56:24.098
Do you want more coffee?

56:26.479 --> 56:28.138
I'm going for a walk.

56:28.355 --> 56:30.977
It's still a while
before Mora returns.

56:31.191 --> 56:33.350
Is working?

56:33.569 --> 56:34.980
Yes.

56:36.697 --> 56:39.401
Well, Ellen...
Your name is Ellen, right?

56:39.616 --> 56:42.451
I thought you would not remember, Johnny.

56:45.496 --> 56:47.323
Thank you for listening to me.

56:47.540 --> 56:50.458
Sometimes it's hard not to
have someone with whom...

56:51.044 --> 56:52.952
Talk a little things.

56:53.170 --> 56:54.450
I know.

56:55.797 --> 56:59.842
"Will you come back here soon?"
- Yes, I will do it.

57:00.260 --> 57:03.047
- See you later.
- Agree.

57:06.474 --> 57:08.217
Bye, Johnny.

57:27.993 --> 57:29.986
- Blackberry.
- Hello.

57:30.204 --> 57:32.077
I'm bathing.

57:34.291 --> 57:37.208
- Have you had a good day?
- Very good.

57:37.419 --> 57:39.660
The pier was crowded.

57:42.798 --> 57:44.174
That's good.

57:44.383 --> 57:46.043
I feel tired.

57:46.469 --> 57:48.545
Why do not you just go away?

57:49.138 --> 57:51.130
Yes, I think I will.

58:19.999 --> 58:23.451
- Are you going to be there for a long time?
- No, not much.

58:24.921 --> 58:27.589
Well, I'm anxious to see you.

01:00:05.011 --> 01:00:06.554
Blackberry?

01:01:27.753 --> 01:01:29.711
Blackberry!

01:02:04.162 --> 01:02:06.201
Blackberry!

01:02:56.043 --> 01:02:58.000
Johnny!

01:02:59.254 --> 01:03:00.629
Johnny!

01:03:21.816 --> 01:03:25.434
Johnny, they were horrible!
Horrible!

01:03:35.328 --> 01:03:38.080
It's okay, everything is fine.

01:04:10.236 --> 01:04:12.773
- Good Morning.
- Good Morning.

01:04:14.239 --> 01:04:16.112
How do you feel?

01:04:17.158 --> 01:04:20.408
- Sleepy.
- Sleepy?

01:04:25.249 --> 01:04:27.918
- Shall I make you breakfast?
- Stay in bed.

01:04:28.126 --> 01:04:29.953
I want you to rest.

01:04:30.170 --> 01:04:32.708
- That's what I want to do.
- All right.

01:04:34.049 --> 01:04:35.791
How are you?

01:04:38.010 --> 01:04:41.711
My body is a bit numb,
but nothing happens.

01:04:42.765 --> 01:04:45.137
Why do not you go get a massage?

01:04:45.434 --> 01:04:48.220
I just do not want to leave you alone.

01:04:48.478 --> 01:04:51.313
I'll be fine.
It's already daylight.

01:04:52.065 --> 01:04:54.141
Are you sure?

01:04:54.859 --> 01:04:58.986
- Where are the bathrooms?
- At the end of the pier.

01:05:00.698 --> 01:05:03.402
Will you rest a
little while outside?

01:05:06.537 --> 01:05:09.407
- See you later.
- Agree.

01:06:01.295 --> 01:06:04.710
You got knots everywhere, boy.

01:06:04.923 --> 01:06:08.588
What's up?
Your girlfriend does not treat you well?

01:06:08.927 --> 01:06:10.551
Is not that...

01:06:12.013 --> 01:06:15.678
- I'm a little tense, that's all.
- Well, we'll get you in shape.

01:06:18.728 --> 01:06:20.804
Wow!
How are you around here?

01:06:21.730 --> 01:06:23.521
What a pleasant surprise.

01:06:24.524 --> 01:06:25.524
Hi.

01:06:25.734 --> 01:06:27.062
How are you, Bruno?

01:06:27.277 --> 01:06:30.313
Hello, captain. Do you want
me to crush you a little?

01:06:30.530 --> 01:06:33.649
How could I give up on pleasure.

01:06:34.867 --> 01:06:39.160
By the way, Johnny, I hope you have
not forgotten our conversation.

01:06:40.247 --> 01:06:43.034
- You worry me, you know?
- Seriously?

01:06:43.625 --> 01:06:46.744
Seriously.
Tell me, has there...?

01:06:46.961 --> 01:06:49.962
Have you been acting
strange recently?

01:06:51.465 --> 01:06:52.465
Do not.

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:54.917
Are you sure you're telling me the truth?

01:06:55.928 --> 01:06:59.592
Does not matter.
I want to give you some advice.

01:06:59.806 --> 01:07:03.934
You have to be especially careful
now that there is a full moon.

01:07:04.978 --> 01:07:07.730
It is when the tide has more force.

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:13.307
What I was saying:
A good understanding...

01:07:14.403 --> 01:07:15.778
That is about...?

01:07:16.488 --> 01:07:18.979
I've been thinking about last night.

01:07:20.159 --> 01:07:22.197
And I have decided...

01:07:22.410 --> 01:07:24.486
That she must be somnambulistic.

01:07:25.705 --> 01:07:27.662
And I do not want to talk about it.

01:07:28.624 --> 01:07:30.284
I'm going to forget it.

01:07:31.502 --> 01:07:33.827
It's the best thing I've heard you say.

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:36.707
We'll forget, okay?

01:07:36.923 --> 01:07:39.212
- That's what I was trying to do.
- I know.

01:07:39.426 --> 01:07:41.253
- Forgotten.
- All right.

01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:44.673
- What do you do?
- Clean the diving equipment.

01:07:44.889 --> 01:07:48.055
Looking at the calendar, I saw
that there is a full moon

01:07:48.267 --> 01:07:51.968
And that the tide will be perfect
in a certain place that I know.

01:07:52.313 --> 01:07:55.397
I thought we can go diving
here this afternoon.

01:08:03.740 --> 01:08:05.946
I do not think that's a good idea.

01:08:07.702 --> 01:08:08.816
Why?

01:08:10.412 --> 01:08:12.369
Its too cold.

01:08:13.498 --> 01:08:15.740
But the water is warm.

01:08:17.586 --> 01:08:19.875
I do not think it's a good
idea, you should rest.

01:08:20.171 --> 01:08:23.171
I do not want to rest,
Johnny, I feel fine.

01:08:23.549 --> 01:08:27.796
We only have the weekend,
I'll rest when you're gone.

01:08:28.304 --> 01:08:29.845
Come with me please.

01:08:31.933 --> 01:08:33.260
Agree.

01:08:34.684 --> 01:08:36.095
Where do you want to go diving?

01:08:36.310 --> 01:08:38.718
It's not far from
here, you'll see.

01:09:05.046 --> 01:09:06.125
You are ready?

01:09:06.339 --> 01:09:07.584
How do you know where we are?

01:09:08.673 --> 01:09:10.500
Because I've been here before.

01:09:15.095 --> 01:09:16.674
There must be a lot of depth.

01:09:16.890 --> 01:09:17.890
Yes.

01:09:18.099 --> 01:09:20.008
Why do you want to dive here?

01:09:20.309 --> 01:09:22.017
There are some reefs down there.

01:09:22.228 --> 01:09:23.935
You will see them.

01:09:29.693 --> 01:09:30.773
Johnny...

01:09:31.654 --> 01:09:33.810
- What?
- Do not stay away from me.

01:09:34.531 --> 01:09:36.322
We must not separate.

01:12:03.292 --> 01:12:04.490
God!

01:12:04.710 --> 01:12:06.251
God!

01:13:37.669 --> 01:13:41.251
"" But it almost
always sinks again. ""

01:14:11.617 --> 01:14:14.286
- Who?
- I bring you the papers, sir.

01:14:14.495 --> 01:14:15.740
Leave them out there.

01:14:47.066 --> 01:14:50.933
THE SPRING FAIR CELEBRATES
ITS TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY

01:15:00.161 --> 01:15:02.403
AMONG THE ATTRACTIONS
THAT, YEAR AFTER YEAR,

01:15:02.622 --> 01:15:05.657
STILL TRYING TO CROWNS
ARE THE MIRROR ROOM...

01:15:05.874 --> 01:15:07.072
THE SIRENA LIVES...

01:16:27.782 --> 01:16:29.905
Mora, ladies and gentlemen.

01:16:30.618 --> 01:16:33.952
The strangest creature you'll
see, Mora the mermaid.

01:16:34.247 --> 01:16:36.038
For 25 cents.

01:16:36.374 --> 01:16:41.414
A quarter of a dollar, ladies and
gentlemen. The mermaid lives.

01:16:42.045 --> 01:16:43.954
See it underwater.

01:16:45.006 --> 01:16:49.218
The mermaid lives, brought directly
from the waters of a distant sea.

01:16:49.803 --> 01:16:51.426
For 25 cents.

01:16:51.637 --> 01:16:54.175
25 cents.
The mermaid lives.

01:16:55.224 --> 01:16:56.718
Blackberry...

01:16:58.102 --> 01:17:02.182
The mermaid lives, ladies and gentlemen.
See it underwater.

01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:06.144
The only siren in captivity.

01:17:06.359 --> 01:17:07.604
For 25 cents.

01:17:50.858 --> 01:17:53.146
I knew you'd come back.

01:17:54.361 --> 01:17:57.232
The murderer always returns
to the scene of the crime.

01:17:58.323 --> 01:18:01.028
I know it did not happen in this place.

01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:03.616
But you had to see her, did not you?

01:18:03.828 --> 01:18:06.829
You had to see the result
of your monstrous act!

01:18:07.081 --> 01:18:09.157
- But I loved her.
- You wanted her...

01:18:09.375 --> 01:18:11.332
What do you know about love?

01:18:11.544 --> 01:18:14.035
I've loved her since
I was a child.

01:18:14.504 --> 01:18:16.627
You did it and you
have to pay for it!

01:18:17.132 --> 01:18:18.792
How did you find it?

01:18:19.509 --> 01:18:20.920
God wanted me to find it.

01:18:21.136 --> 01:18:24.339
She was such a good and beautiful girl...

01:18:24.556 --> 01:18:25.719
Why?

01:18:27.641 --> 01:18:28.839
Why?

01:18:34.315 --> 01:18:36.307
I thought the shooting
house was closing, today.

01:18:36.525 --> 01:18:38.481
And so it is.
It has sounded out there.

01:18:47.702 --> 01:18:49.908
What's going on here, my friend?

01:19:02.298 --> 01:19:04.753
VENICE POLICE
COMMITTEE DIVISION 4

01:19:05.593 --> 01:19:07.918
Come in, Johnny.
Sit down.

01:19:09.930 --> 01:19:13.181
This is a little irregular, but
the captain wants to declare

01:19:13.392 --> 01:19:15.265
And has asked you to be present.

01:19:19.105 --> 01:19:21.181
Go ahead, Captain Murdock.

01:19:25.445 --> 01:19:30.402
I'll start by saying that no matter
how mean and irrational it may seem,

01:19:30.741 --> 01:19:33.066
But I did what I did
because I loved Mora.

01:19:33.285 --> 01:19:35.325
I loved her from the
moment I met her.

01:19:35.662 --> 01:19:39.789
It was a pathetic little thing in
that village on a Greek island.

01:19:39.999 --> 01:19:44.460
Abandoned, I would have died of
starvation if I had not been taken.

01:19:45.254 --> 01:19:49.714
Evidently, I knew that, like
all children, I would grow

01:19:50.091 --> 01:19:53.674
And leave his home.
He had that thought in his mind.

01:19:54.596 --> 01:19:56.968
I could not face the
thought of leaving me.

01:19:57.182 --> 01:19:58.806
So I decided...

01:19:59.017 --> 01:20:01.721
Plan something to
keep her by my side.

01:20:02.311 --> 01:20:06.356
The best thing seemed to make
me depend entirely on my love.

01:20:07.441 --> 01:20:09.683
To get it...

01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:13.691
I told him the legend of
the people of the sea.

01:20:13.905 --> 01:20:17.440
Little by little, I made his young
mind believe that he was one of them

01:20:17.659 --> 01:20:19.865
And that one day he
should return with them.

01:20:20.078 --> 01:20:24.490
I could not have normal
relationships with normal people.

01:20:25.374 --> 01:20:29.870
But I did not count on the power
of his will to be independent.

01:20:30.504 --> 01:20:34.798
In the end, my love was not enough, I
wanted to have another kind of love.

01:20:35.467 --> 01:20:38.135
When he began to have
these relationships...

01:20:38.344 --> 01:20:42.555
I decided I could
only cut them off.

01:20:43.265 --> 01:20:45.638
So I killed those two young men.

01:20:46.435 --> 01:20:49.720
And I tried to persuade her in
some way that she had been,

01:20:49.938 --> 01:20:53.982
Under the strange influence of the
sea creatures, and I succeeded.

01:20:54.192 --> 01:20:57.691
I managed to bring fear
and doubt into his mind.

01:20:58.363 --> 01:21:00.190
Still, he wanted his freedom.

01:21:00.406 --> 01:21:04.154
He left my house, rented a
flat, and then met Johnny.

01:21:04.368 --> 01:21:07.238
If he has told the story,

01:21:07.454 --> 01:21:09.032
You will know the rest.

01:21:11.250 --> 01:21:13.953
My psychological experiment failed,

01:21:14.168 --> 01:21:16.576
Or maybe it was too successful.

01:21:16.796 --> 01:21:19.002
He could not face a repetition
of what had happened,

01:21:19.215 --> 01:21:21.706
So, rather than destroy
the person he loved,

01:21:21.926 --> 01:21:25.045
He preferred to surrender
to the depths.

01:21:25.929 --> 01:21:27.637
That's what happened.

01:21:28.807 --> 01:21:30.005
True?

01:21:31.476 --> 01:21:32.851
Yes.

01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:36.722
You wanted her, right?

01:21:41.694 --> 01:21:43.982
Then maybe you can understand me.

01:21:44.947 --> 01:21:46.322
Although a little.

01:21:51.035 --> 01:21:52.529
If I understand.

01:21:52.745 --> 01:21:55.663
Captain Murdock, I
still have a question.

01:21:55.873 --> 01:21:58.080
Johnny told me about a
woman who frightened Mora.

01:21:58.292 --> 01:22:00.829
She was supposed to be one
of the sea creatures.

01:22:02.045 --> 01:22:04.370
I assume that was part of your plan.

01:22:05.006 --> 01:22:06.666
I do not know what you are talking about.

01:22:06.883 --> 01:22:09.255
You know, the one I followed
to his house that day.

01:22:09.803 --> 01:22:13.052
- He remembers?
- I remember you mentioned it before,

01:22:13.264 --> 01:22:15.091
But there was no woman.

01:22:15.307 --> 01:22:17.300
I do not know what you mean.

01:22:19.603 --> 01:22:21.263
I've told you everything.

01:22:21.814 --> 01:22:22.814
Can I leave?

01:22:23.190 --> 01:22:24.470
Guard.

01:22:36.827 --> 01:22:39.033
But I saw that woman
with my own eyes.

01:22:39.246 --> 01:22:41.452
It was not something Mora imagined.

01:22:42.165 --> 01:22:43.446
It's almost...

01:22:43.667 --> 01:22:46.288
As if there was something
true in what she said.

01:22:46.503 --> 01:22:50.334
It is more likely that the captain
is protecting that woman.

01:22:50.548 --> 01:22:52.339
- I guess so.
- Yes?

01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:54.459
The military police
have come to get Drake.

01:22:54.677 --> 01:22:55.875
Now it comes out.

01:23:00.181 --> 01:23:02.008
Good luck, boy.

01:23:04.769 --> 01:23:06.596
At the end of the hallway.

01:23:15.654 --> 01:23:16.685
Hi.

01:23:19.783 --> 01:23:20.783
Hi.

01:23:21.452 --> 01:23:25.614
I knew you were here and I came in
case I could do anything for you.

01:23:26.372 --> 01:23:27.617
Thank you.

01:23:30.084 --> 01:23:31.911
I'm sorry about Mora.

01:23:42.429 --> 01:23:44.468
I hope that...

01:23:45.348 --> 01:23:48.930
On your next permit come and take
a ride on the merry-go-round.

01:23:50.436 --> 01:23:52.013
I would like.

01:23:52.229 --> 01:23:53.474
All right.

01:23:57.735 --> 01:23:59.311
See you around.

01:23:59.527 --> 01:24:00.938
Agree.

01:24:16.918 --> 01:24:18.626
Bye.

01:24:37.854 --> 01:24:41.305
- Oh, it does not rain anymore.
- It seems.

01:24:53.629 --> 01:24:56.329
"SO, DURING THE YOUNG TIDE
NEXT TO MY BELOVED, AMADA,

01:24:56.354 --> 01:24:58.753
MY LIFE AND MY WIFE, IN HIS
SEPULCRO, THERE, BY THE SEA,

01:24:58.778 --> 01:25:01.178
