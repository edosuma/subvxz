WEBVTT

00:06.047 --> 00:09.676
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:12.512 --> 00:14.973
Come on, MJ. We have to leave!

00:15.056 --> 00:16.599
We have to go. Look at me!

00:16.683 --> 00:18.643
Calm down. We need to go, MJ.

00:24.232 --> 00:25.358
Oh my God!

00:25.442 --> 00:26.401
What have you done?

00:26.484 --> 00:28.028
Get out of here!

00:28.111 --> 00:29.029
Run!

00:29.654 --> 00:32.615
Come on!

00:46.337 --> 00:48.089
Is the fire under control?

00:48.173 --> 00:52.886
My team is making sure
there's no one in the building.

00:52.969 --> 00:54.471
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

00:54.554 --> 00:55.847
What are you doing here?

00:55.930 --> 00:57.474
Get moving.

00:57.557 --> 01:01.061
Celina, I've identified
the six people who took the uniforms.

01:02.812 --> 01:04.773
-Sir, what's your name?
-Juan.

01:04.856 --> 01:08.109
Juan, please check again.
Smoke could ruin my vocal cords.

01:08.193 --> 01:11.029
-I have an audition this week.
-You're perfectly fine.

01:11.112 --> 01:12.197
Just check again.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.451
-I'm sure she's one of them.
-Maybe.

01:16.951 --> 01:19.287
But then again, it could be anyone.

01:19.788 --> 01:20.622
Jana!

01:21.456 --> 01:22.957
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

01:27.629 --> 01:29.506
Do you think we're in trouble?

01:30.006 --> 01:31.132
Definitely.

01:43.353 --> 01:45.146
REBEL

01:52.570 --> 01:54.072
Let's be honest.

01:56.282 --> 01:58.326
We're getting expelled, I'm sure of it.

01:58.409 --> 02:00.662
Auditions are Thursday. What do we do?

02:00.745 --> 02:04.040
Calm down, Taco Bell. They won't expel me.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.876
Look, let's tell the truth, period.

02:06.960 --> 02:10.130
Sure, someone dragged us
out of our rooms at 3:00 a.m.

02:10.213 --> 02:12.590
and forced us to wear these uniforms.

02:12.674 --> 02:15.135
When the prefect came,
it was just us and a fire.

02:15.218 --> 02:18.221
-They won't believe us.
-It's what happened.

02:18.304 --> 02:21.683
-Right? Devil stuff.
-God, you're so dramatic.

02:22.183 --> 02:24.018
They won't expel a Colucci,

02:24.561 --> 02:26.479
or baby Belinda here.

02:27.605 --> 02:30.066
We don't have a choice.
We have to tell the truth.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.485
Masked students?

02:33.111 --> 02:36.156
You couldn't come up with space aliens,

02:36.239 --> 02:38.074
or a more ridiculous excuse?

02:38.158 --> 02:40.160
You'd know about ridiculous.

02:40.243 --> 02:42.495
Careful, Mr. Colucci. Careful.

02:42.579 --> 02:44.330
This is very serious.

02:45.081 --> 02:47.500
You risked your lives and everyone else's.

02:47.584 --> 02:50.003
This calls for expulsion, Celina.

02:50.086 --> 02:51.713
Even for you, Mr. Colucci.

02:51.796 --> 02:53.131
What about auditions?

02:53.214 --> 02:54.632
-But you--
-But nothing.

02:54.716 --> 02:59.387
You can only stay and audition
if you tell me what really happened.

03:00.555 --> 03:04.017
You could also believe
what we already told you,

03:04.100 --> 03:08.354
and find those masked creeps
who kidnap students in their sleep.

03:09.898 --> 03:11.733
Okay. Very well.

03:11.816 --> 03:14.944
Without concrete evidence,
I have no other choice.

03:15.028 --> 03:18.323
I'll have to discuss this
at the board meeting on Thursday.

03:18.406 --> 03:21.201
In the meantime, none of you can audition.

03:25.496 --> 03:26.331
That's right.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.000
It was me.

03:29.918 --> 03:30.752
Jana, don't.

03:33.421 --> 03:36.633
I wanted to do something fun
on the first night,

03:36.716 --> 03:39.177
but I never meant
to set the school on fire.

03:40.386 --> 03:43.681
I knew you'd be trouble, Ms. Cohen.

03:45.391 --> 03:47.393
Nothing good comes with fame.

03:48.269 --> 03:49.479
Jana, tell me the truth.

03:49.562 --> 03:50.438
It's the truth.

03:51.564 --> 03:54.025
It was me.
No one else should pay for this.

03:56.986 --> 04:01.282
Fine. Until the school board
determines disciplinary action,

04:01.366 --> 04:04.369
you'll stay for detention
every day after class.

04:04.452 --> 04:06.454
-With the rest of you.
-Why?

04:06.537 --> 04:09.832
I said all of you.
That includes you, Mr. Colucci.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.586
-Yes?
-What about auditions?

04:15.004 --> 04:16.589
You can all audition.

04:18.675 --> 04:19.801
Except you.

04:35.191 --> 04:38.653
AUDITIONS

05:00.883 --> 05:02.093
Okay, guys.

05:02.176 --> 05:04.846
The sooner we start, the sooner we finish.

05:04.929 --> 05:08.891
Nope, count me out.
I don't have the genes for this.

05:09.475 --> 05:12.437
I can't waste time. I have to practice.

05:12.520 --> 05:15.773
This isn't optional, Luka,
it's our punishment.

05:15.857 --> 05:18.818
Sweetie, it's your punishment.
We're collateral damage.

05:18.901 --> 05:20.778
Jana saved our necks.

05:20.862 --> 05:21.946
She really did.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.656
In fact, I'll take this.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.325
You kick back and relax.

05:25.825 --> 05:30.330
Have fun watching Luka sweep
for the first time in his life.

05:31.205 --> 05:36.502
Please, let's give it up
for Saint Jana of the Perpetual Sacrifice.

05:36.586 --> 05:39.756
Come on, let's give her
a big round of applause.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.841
You did it for the attention, right?

05:43.468 --> 05:46.054
No, Jana, we super owe you.

05:47.472 --> 05:49.307
Speak for yourself, Speedy Gonzalez.

05:49.807 --> 05:52.852
I don't owe anyone anything. I'm out.

05:52.935 --> 05:55.104
Hang on a sec, "collateral damage."

05:56.230 --> 06:00.109
How about you cut the bullshit
and help us clean?

06:00.693 --> 06:04.906
I just don't feel like learning
the customs of your tribe.

06:04.989 --> 06:09.035
None of us want to be here,
but you can't just leave.

06:09.118 --> 06:11.412
Bro, I'm a Colucci.

06:11.496 --> 06:12.914
I can do whatever I want.

06:12.997 --> 06:15.750
Rat me out if you want,
the door's that way.

06:16.250 --> 06:17.126
I don't care.

06:17.627 --> 06:18.669
Excuse me.

06:20.838 --> 06:22.215
What a dick.

06:22.298 --> 06:24.258
When did he become such a bully?

06:24.342 --> 06:25.843
He can't get away with this.

06:25.927 --> 06:26.761
Forget him.

06:28.012 --> 06:29.389
Bullies are often bullied.

06:29.472 --> 06:31.307
I learned that from my tribe.

07:08.386 --> 07:09.429
Stop!

07:12.557 --> 07:13.391
Stop it!

07:15.476 --> 07:17.603
Dude, you're a natural.

07:17.687 --> 07:19.605
You should do the whole school.

07:20.189 --> 07:23.734
I'd love to, but Jana is the real natural.

07:23.818 --> 07:25.361
If she joins me, I'm down.

07:34.245 --> 07:35.955
I can't believe they made you do this.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.417
It's not too bad, actually.

07:43.045 --> 07:45.131
-I brought food.
-For everyone?

07:45.715 --> 07:46.757
No, just you.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.846
Look, I've been thinking.

07:52.597 --> 07:55.183
I'm going to tell my mom
you're being treated like this.

07:55.266 --> 07:56.601
No way, SebastiÃ¡n.

07:56.684 --> 07:59.979
Everyone thinks I got in here
for the wrong reasons.

08:00.062 --> 08:02.398
What will they think
if your mom rescues me?

08:02.482 --> 08:06.110
Jana, I know your independence
is super important to you,

08:06.611 --> 08:07.862
and I respect that. But,

08:09.530 --> 08:11.324
everyone needs help sometimes.

08:11.407 --> 08:13.409
What would I do if you got expelled?

08:13.493 --> 08:16.245
Easy, find another singer
for the competition.

08:17.663 --> 08:18.915
Jana, I'm serious.

08:30.051 --> 08:31.761
-I should get back.
-No.

08:31.844 --> 08:33.346
-Yes.
-No.

08:33.429 --> 08:34.972
We have so much to do.

08:35.473 --> 08:36.307
Fine.

08:42.021 --> 08:43.022
Hey!

08:43.689 --> 08:45.566
There are sandwiches for everyone.

09:01.082 --> 09:04.335
Excellent reflexes, Mr. Nicebutt.

09:04.418 --> 09:07.088
Dude, I hate it when you call me that.

09:07.588 --> 09:09.840
What? Oh no.

09:09.924 --> 09:12.176
Did you have a fight with Jana-banana?

09:12.260 --> 09:14.136
Are you sad she got expelled

09:14.220 --> 09:17.890
and you've lost your last chance
to win the Battle of the Bands?

09:17.974 --> 09:22.019
Emilia, she's not getting expelled.
Unlike you, she matters to EWS.

09:22.603 --> 09:27.650
I don't know, Sebas.
Our story was much more moving,

09:27.733 --> 09:29.235
more media-friendly.

09:29.860 --> 09:32.989
The son of Mexico's
most important politician,

09:33.072 --> 09:37.410
a selfless, upstanding young man
in love with a scholarship kid,

09:37.493 --> 09:40.997
the poor but hugely talented girl
from Brazil.

09:44.041 --> 09:45.876
She makes you nervous, huh?

09:48.004 --> 09:49.880
Are you scared she's better than you?

09:54.635 --> 09:57.221
I'm going to love
watching you two crash and burn.

10:00.725 --> 10:01.559
Yeah?

10:08.524 --> 10:09.400
Get over it.

10:12.236 --> 10:13.779
Jealousy looks bad on you.

10:19.535 --> 10:24.081
<i>You're probably wondering</i>
<i>what life is like at EWS.</i>

10:24.165 --> 10:25.625
<i>Everything is pretty great.</i>

10:26.208 --> 10:27.710
Except for the students.

10:29.211 --> 10:30.588
<i>I mean, look at this guy.</i>

10:34.216 --> 10:36.344
-What the hell?
-Give me the phone.

10:36.427 --> 10:40.473
Don't cry, you fucking extra
in a Lady Gaga video.

10:40.556 --> 10:43.643
You think you're funny?
Let me tell you two things.

10:43.726 --> 10:47.271
First, Lady Gaga is old news,
so update your references.

10:47.855 --> 10:50.191
And second, you know what I was thinking?

10:50.274 --> 10:54.820
Your homophobia seems
to be hiding something.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.781
What's up? Do you have a crush on me?

10:58.699 --> 11:00.201
You calling me gay, asshole?

11:02.870 --> 11:05.039
You didn't get
the Homo sapiens update, huh?

11:06.957 --> 11:08.209
Give me my phone.

11:10.753 --> 11:11.671
Fucking fairy.

11:24.850 --> 11:28.437
Yes, Mom, I'm playing
Bach's <i>Saint Matthew Passion,</i>

11:28.521 --> 11:29.980
like I promised Pastor Jones.

11:30.064 --> 11:33.192
I was just practicing.
Auditions are in two days.

11:33.275 --> 11:34.235
<i>I'm so proud.</i>

11:34.318 --> 11:37.655
<i>Always sharing the joy of God</i>
<i>with your music.</i>

11:37.738 --> 11:42.868
<i>Your kisses so wet</i>
<i>My back is arching</i>â¦

11:42.952 --> 11:43.786
<i>Who's singing?</i>

11:45.329 --> 11:46.997
<i>Make love to me wildly</i>

11:47.081 --> 11:48.290
<i>-Who was that?</i>
-I gotta go.

11:51.043 --> 11:54.755
Wow. How do you get your mom
to believe that bullshit, dude?

11:54.839 --> 11:55.840
Experience.

11:56.549 --> 11:57.466
It shows.

11:57.550 --> 12:00.469
<i>I was born in a hood</i>
<i>Different than most</i>

12:00.553 --> 12:04.223
<i>I never got a chance to leave</i>
<i>You've probably been to Madrid</i>

12:04.306 --> 12:07.852
<i>I'm not afraid of adventure</i>
<i>Sanity's gone, I'm all conjecture</i>

12:07.935 --> 12:11.564
<i>Haters can't pierce my armor</i>
<i>I only eat bread</i>

12:11.647 --> 12:14.191
You're like the Arjona
of South American rap.

12:15.025 --> 12:17.528
I can't believe it, bro!

12:19.238 --> 12:22.992
Look what the cat dragged in.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.829
Who sent you back here?

12:26.912 --> 12:28.414
No one, I was walking by.

12:29.248 --> 12:33.461
So, either you missed us
or you have no friends.

12:33.544 --> 12:36.881
Your misery inspires me.
I need that for my audition.

12:37.798 --> 12:40.176
Luka, we all know you're a great singer.

12:41.635 --> 12:43.053
Your teacher was a good man.

12:43.637 --> 12:44.764
Woman, actually.

12:45.848 --> 12:46.932
Does that bother you?

12:48.017 --> 12:49.935
Leave him. He's just bitter.

12:50.019 --> 12:52.271
Loneliness is bad for people, you know?

12:52.354 --> 12:53.773
Jana, always to the rescue.

12:53.856 --> 12:56.066
Why don't you adopt a puppy instead?

12:58.736 --> 12:59.820
You missed a spot.

13:02.198 --> 13:03.115
Hey.

13:04.074 --> 13:06.994
Do you mind if I come later
to watch you practice?

13:07.077 --> 13:08.746
I could use the distraction.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.435
Wow, not bad.

13:32.144 --> 13:34.772
Really? No, I mean,

13:35.314 --> 13:39.568
I know it didn't suck, but really?

13:39.652 --> 13:43.405
I mean, if you think that,
I guess, thank you.

13:43.489 --> 13:44.365
Sorry, let meâ¦

13:46.951 --> 13:49.870
-Everything okay down there?
-Just peachy.

13:54.166 --> 13:58.128
Good luck on your audition.
Not that you need it.

14:03.926 --> 14:06.303
I'm such a dork.

14:13.185 --> 14:14.937
My hands are too small.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.939
It just takes practice.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.693
What's the point of all this?

14:20.776 --> 14:23.737
I mean, I probably won't
get a chance to audition.

14:25.865 --> 14:29.785
Look, Jana. Even if they kick you out,
you're still an artist.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.078
An artist?

14:31.745 --> 14:35.207
Most people here will tell you
I have a half-decent voice

14:35.291 --> 14:38.460
and I became a one-hit wonder
thanks to my producer dad.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.921
I don't think that makes me an "artist."

14:41.422 --> 14:43.215
Is that why you took the blame?

14:43.299 --> 14:44.842
You don't think you're good enough?

14:45.718 --> 14:47.219
Chill. You don't even know me.

14:49.805 --> 14:52.391
Okay, sorry if that was too much.

14:54.602 --> 14:55.811
Maybe you're right.

14:56.312 --> 14:59.356
Or maybe Luka is right,
and I did it for attention.

15:00.065 --> 15:03.736
Or maybe I did it because
I thought I had the least to lose.

15:04.236 --> 15:07.323
-You don't care if they expel you?
-Of course I care.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.033
But you're scared.

15:14.538 --> 15:16.916
To be honest, we're all scared.

15:17.499 --> 15:20.044
But that doesn't mean you should give up.

15:20.127 --> 15:22.254
So let's practice for your audition.

15:23.547 --> 15:25.549
Who are you, Esteban from Puebla?

15:42.107 --> 15:43.108
Dixon.

15:43.901 --> 15:44.902
I need your help.

15:45.736 --> 15:49.365
You're the only one around here
who's worldly and unafraid.

15:50.407 --> 15:51.325
Sorry?

15:51.408 --> 15:53.702
You grew up in a rough place, right?

15:54.578 --> 15:58.999
Well, yeah, sure.
I've seen all sorts of stuff.

15:59.083 --> 16:01.669
You're going to help me find who did this.

16:02.836 --> 16:03.921
I don't want to get--

16:04.004 --> 16:08.175
I just need some evidence
to show Celina that we didn't do it.

16:08.258 --> 16:10.427
The board meeting is in two days.

16:11.345 --> 16:13.055
Dixon, I'm not leaving.

16:14.932 --> 16:15.933
Will you help me?

16:20.938 --> 16:21.855
All right.

16:23.440 --> 16:24.358
Let's see.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.027
Okay.

16:29.029 --> 16:31.407
What about the security footage?

16:31.490 --> 16:33.492
They shut the cameras off.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.870
What about the other freshmen
who were there?

16:36.954 --> 16:40.249
They won't talk. They're afraid
of looking like accomplices.

16:40.958 --> 16:43.168
I don't know. There must be something.

16:43.752 --> 16:45.713
Do we even have a suspect list?

16:46.380 --> 16:47.214
One thing.

16:47.715 --> 16:50.551
Before we left,
one of them hurt their ankle. I saw.

16:53.637 --> 16:56.807
So, we have to find
the guy who hurt his ankle.

16:58.934 --> 17:00.144
Just a little.

17:01.854 --> 17:02.813
Or girl.

17:08.193 --> 17:10.320
Thanks. I'm feeling better already.

17:10.404 --> 17:11.363
Where do I sign?

17:12.197 --> 17:13.115
Here, please.

17:13.198 --> 17:14.616
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

17:26.962 --> 17:28.297
-It was Emilia.
-Emilia?

17:28.380 --> 17:29.214
How do you know?

17:29.298 --> 17:32.259
Before they ran,
one of them hurt their ankle.

17:32.342 --> 17:35.304
Emilia was at the nurse's
right after the fire.

17:35.804 --> 17:39.183
How can you jump to conclusions
just like that?

17:39.683 --> 17:43.312
Plus, Emilia speaks funny.
We would've noticed.

17:43.395 --> 17:45.022
Dude, they all spoke funny.

17:46.190 --> 17:47.232
Good point.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.485
Plus, she's my boyfriend's ex.

17:50.069 --> 17:50.986
This is personal.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.780
How can you be so sure?

17:52.863 --> 17:55.741
I just have to prove her ankle is injured.

17:55.824 --> 17:58.118
That's going to be easy.

17:58.202 --> 17:59.119
How?

17:59.203 --> 18:00.537
She won't even notice.

18:00.621 --> 18:03.290
You guys, chill. I'll handle it.

18:15.052 --> 18:18.013
Emilia, I love your shoes!
Where did you get them?

18:18.097 --> 18:19.348
Thanks.

18:19.431 --> 18:20.641
Can I see them?

18:20.724 --> 18:23.102
Let me take a look, I really like them.

18:23.185 --> 18:25.771
-No.
-Emilia, let me see them!

18:25.854 --> 18:29.817
What are you doing?
You're crazy, let go of me!

18:29.900 --> 18:32.736
You're acting crazy! Let go of me!

18:32.820 --> 18:33.987
Jana!

18:34.571 --> 18:35.739
Leash your pet, please.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.075
What happened?

18:38.158 --> 18:40.661
I just asked to see her shoes,
and she freaked.

18:40.744 --> 18:43.205
-You didn't have to be violent.
-So dramatic.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.014
Wow.

19:01.515 --> 19:02.516
What?

19:03.100 --> 19:04.101
Nothing, I just--

19:04.184 --> 19:05.018
Oh, okay.

19:09.398 --> 19:10.566
Try it without the vibrato.

19:13.318 --> 19:14.611
Is someone else here?

19:15.821 --> 19:17.197
What? No.

19:17.281 --> 19:19.074
I was wondering who asked you.

19:23.078 --> 19:24.913
It was just a suggestion, Luka.

19:26.915 --> 19:28.083
I have one for you.

19:29.001 --> 19:29.835
Let's hear it.

19:32.796 --> 19:33.630
Deodorant.

19:36.258 --> 19:37.134
Seriously.

19:49.313 --> 19:52.024
BATTLE OF THE BANDS

19:54.484 --> 19:56.737
I think I'm losing my mind.

19:57.946 --> 20:01.533
You were a little impulsive with Emilia.

20:01.617 --> 20:03.952
Just take it easy, it's not a big deal.

20:04.036 --> 20:07.623
The most important thing now
is that we stay patient.

20:07.706 --> 20:10.334
I couldn't find anything
in the videos from last night.

20:10.417 --> 20:12.211
I'm running out of time.

20:12.294 --> 20:13.337
Let me see.

20:21.303 --> 20:23.430
<i>Holy shit! The school is on fire!</i>

20:24.431 --> 20:26.058
Isn't that Sebas' dorm?

20:27.726 --> 20:28.602
Yeah. So?

20:28.685 --> 20:31.438
Why wasn't Sebas in his room?

20:31.521 --> 20:32.522
What do you mean?

20:32.606 --> 20:37.027
It's suspicious that he wasn't
where he was supposed to be.

20:38.153 --> 20:40.989
No, I don't think so.
It couldn't have been him.

20:44.409 --> 20:45.369
What's going on?

20:46.119 --> 20:47.412
Are you changing schools?

20:48.747 --> 20:51.041
Just dorms. Sorry to disappoint you.

20:51.124 --> 20:52.251
What?

20:52.334 --> 20:54.336
We were just getting to know each other.

20:55.420 --> 20:56.755
Why would I stay?

20:57.339 --> 20:58.674
Maybe to make friends?

21:00.050 --> 21:01.510
Lucky for me, I have enough friends.

21:03.220 --> 21:06.014
If you change your mind,
you're always welcome.

21:06.098 --> 21:09.351
I'm not used to sharing,
especially with smelly dudes.

21:11.353 --> 21:12.562
Just kidding, man.

21:19.319 --> 21:21.822
Why do you care so much about him?

21:21.905 --> 21:23.198
That dude is crazy.

21:23.865 --> 21:26.868
He treats people however he wants.

21:26.952 --> 21:29.746
You should focus on your audition,
not him.

21:29.830 --> 21:33.792
Plus, wouldn't it be better
to have the dorm to ourselves?

21:33.875 --> 21:34.876
I guess.

21:37.879 --> 21:39.089
Jana, are you serious?

21:40.966 --> 21:43.927
I thought you meant
a different physical activity.

21:44.553 --> 21:47.306
There are more fun ways to burn calories.

21:47.389 --> 21:52.436
I feel like we need to stretch,
maybe release some stress.

21:52.519 --> 21:54.396
-Nope.
-Oh, come on.

21:54.479 --> 21:57.482
-I said no.
-Lie back, I'll help you stretch.

21:58.150 --> 22:01.778
Let's start with this leg, nice and easy.

22:01.862 --> 22:04.156
-What are you doing?
-Helping you stretch.

22:05.073 --> 22:06.783
You're acting weird. Why?

22:10.620 --> 22:11.830
Tell me the truth.

22:11.913 --> 22:13.123
About what?

22:13.206 --> 22:15.083
Were you part of the hazing?

22:17.169 --> 22:18.003
Are you serious?

22:19.171 --> 22:21.631
Jana, don't you think I would've told you?

22:22.132 --> 22:22.966
Or stopped it?

22:24.926 --> 22:27.888
-It was just a question.
-It's not just a question.

22:28.555 --> 22:30.057
You're doubting my principles.

22:30.140 --> 22:31.725
I wouldn't do something like that.

22:31.808 --> 22:33.685
Especially not to the person I love most.

22:37.189 --> 22:40.192
-How's your new dorm?
<i>-It's fine.</i>

22:40.901 --> 22:42.235
What do I owe you?

22:42.319 --> 22:44.863
Will you ever stop thinking
I'm against you?

22:45.364 --> 22:46.198
On the contraryâ¦

22:46.281 --> 22:47.240
DEPOSIT -Â $100,000.00

22:48.367 --> 22:49.576
I only want to help.

22:52.746 --> 22:54.164
Is it Christmas already?

22:54.247 --> 22:56.333
<i>I'm feeling generous.</i> <i>Enjoy it.</i>

22:56.833 --> 23:00.128
That reminds me,
I have another gift for you.

23:05.926 --> 23:07.636
-What's this?
-Your new car.

23:09.012 --> 23:12.557
<i>Are you feeling guilty</i>
<i>after years of being an absent father?</i>

23:14.768 --> 23:18.939
The car is yours
if you switch to the business program.

23:19.523 --> 23:21.441
<i>And stop playing Liberace.</i>

23:21.942 --> 23:23.110
I'm not playing.

23:23.193 --> 23:24.277
Your choice, Luka.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.948
The car is just a taste of what's to come.

23:28.907 --> 23:31.868
<i>I'll be at the school this Thursday.</i>
<i>I have a board meeting.</i>

23:31.952 --> 23:35.414
I hope you'll make a smart choice by then.

23:54.516 --> 23:56.268
Ready for the audition tomorrow?

23:56.351 --> 23:58.103
Yeah. Will you be there?

23:58.186 --> 24:00.522
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

24:00.605 --> 24:02.232
Great. I'll see you there.

24:04.734 --> 24:09.156
If I get expelled tomorrow,
we might never see each other again.

24:10.198 --> 24:12.367
I don't know, it's up to you.

24:25.172 --> 24:26.173
Are you okay?

24:29.801 --> 24:31.970
This could be our last night together.

24:32.762 --> 24:36.224
Cheer up, Jani.
Maybe tomorrow someone will confess.

24:37.893 --> 24:40.645
I feel like a soldier
waiting for the firing squad.

24:41.605 --> 24:43.356
I'm going to need a miracle.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.775
Miracles do exist, you know?

24:46.443 --> 24:47.777
I prayed for you.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.488
You'll be okay.

24:50.155 --> 24:52.407
Yeah, don't worry.

24:52.991 --> 24:54.659
It'll all work out, Jani.

25:33.156 --> 25:37.202
I know you're here for the meeting,
so don't act like you care.

25:37.285 --> 25:38.328
Luka, don't start.

25:40.997 --> 25:42.415
Are they kicking her out?

25:42.916 --> 25:44.459
The girl who set the fire?

25:45.252 --> 25:46.336
What do you think?

25:48.338 --> 25:50.173
Will you switch to the business program?

25:51.049 --> 25:52.717
My offer won't last forever.

25:52.801 --> 25:55.095
-Come to my audition first.
-I'm not playing.

25:56.012 --> 25:57.347
Me neither.

25:59.015 --> 26:01.059
You know, now I realize.

26:02.185 --> 26:03.270
I'm the problem.

26:04.187 --> 26:09.484
I keep expecting you to behave
like someone you'll never be.

26:11.570 --> 26:12.737
See you at my audition!

26:15.490 --> 26:17.617
-Guillermo Ãlvarez!
-Dixon Ãlvarez.

26:23.164 --> 26:26.001
Just arrived from Colombia, brothers.

26:26.501 --> 26:28.712
Hey, dumbass! Speak Spanish.

26:31.006 --> 26:35.468
-Kuri, get out of here.
-No, it's fine. He can stay.

26:37.220 --> 26:39.472
I'm an artist who loves a tough crowd.

26:40.056 --> 26:40.890
Yeah!

26:42.183 --> 26:43.351
Nice skirt.

26:46.730 --> 26:48.607
Shout out to those up top!

26:50.775 --> 26:52.861
And for the haters, all my love.

26:53.820 --> 26:55.905
He wears the skirt better than you.

26:55.989 --> 26:57.907
I know, for sure.

26:58.408 --> 27:02.203
This is dedicated to the girl
who taught me everything.

27:02.996 --> 27:03.955
My teacher,

27:05.290 --> 27:06.124
the street.

27:07.667 --> 27:08.501
Go ahead.

27:10.879 --> 27:11.796
All right.

27:14.799 --> 27:16.718
Come on, Dixon!

27:19.638 --> 27:22.390
<i>I was born in a hood</i>
<i>Different than most</i>

27:22.474 --> 27:26.353
<i>I never got a chance to leave</i>
<i>You've probably been to Madrid</i>

27:26.436 --> 27:29.439
<i>I'm not afraid of adventure</i>
<i>Sanity gone, I'm all conjecture</i>

27:29.522 --> 27:33.360
<i>Haters can't pierce my armor</i>
<i>All I eat is bread, I stay warmer</i>

27:33.443 --> 27:36.946
<i>I didn't choose to be a rebel</i>
<i>It's what I had to be</i>

27:37.030 --> 27:40.116
<i>All this war and hatred is too crazy</i>

27:40.200 --> 27:43.536
<i>But music saved me from trouble that I see</i>

27:43.620 --> 27:47.082
<i>Now I sing my lyrics from the heart</i>
<i>Inside of me</i>

27:48.124 --> 27:49.292
<i>Yeah</i>

28:04.182 --> 28:05.475
MarÃ­a JosÃ© Sevilla.

29:02.240 --> 29:06.870
<i>How do I explain myÂ fate</i>
<i>You're no longer there</i>

29:07.495 --> 29:12.417
<i>How do I get rid of this wild frenzy?</i>

29:12.917 --> 29:19.132
<i>This insanity I feel for you</i>
<i>The chemistry you create in me</i>

29:19.215 --> 29:23.052
<i>I can't do this, girl</i>
<i>I can't do this, girl</i>

29:23.136 --> 29:27.724
<i>Forgive me if I led you on</i>
<i>It was never my intent</i>

29:28.349 --> 29:32.812
<i>I know when love is real</i>
<i>It always comes back</i>

29:33.897 --> 29:39.778
<i>How do I forget your skin?</i>
<i>How do I forget you, girl?</i>

29:40.361 --> 29:43.406
<i>I can't do this, girl</i>
<i>I can't do this, girl</i>

29:43.490 --> 29:44.991
<i>Baby, no</i>

29:45.575 --> 29:50.371
<i>I refuse to give you a last kiss</i>
<i>So save it</i>

29:50.872 --> 29:55.293
<i>So that next time I can give it to you</i>

29:56.044 --> 30:00.423
<i>Doing it like this</i>
<i>Like this, like this</i>

30:01.466 --> 30:04.093
<i>Just the way you like it, baby</i>

30:27.242 --> 30:28.368
Let's go, MJ!

30:43.091 --> 30:44.175
You're up.

30:48.054 --> 30:48.888
Do you want these?

30:49.931 --> 30:52.100
I need them to play, so yes.

30:53.309 --> 30:56.729
If you give them back to me,

30:56.813 --> 30:58.690
I can show you how good I am.

31:01.317 --> 31:02.735
I know how good you are.

31:04.153 --> 31:05.363
Break a leg.

33:23.543 --> 33:25.878
You're going to be okay, I'm sure.

33:26.713 --> 33:27.755
Me, not so much.

34:03.708 --> 34:04.542
Wow.

34:07.128 --> 34:08.254
This is so moving.

34:08.838 --> 34:13.051
You have nothing better to do
than hang around us, right?

34:15.553 --> 34:16.721
You wish.

34:18.431 --> 34:20.183
I'm going to be late, bye.

34:21.809 --> 34:23.102
See you at your audition.

34:30.610 --> 34:32.028
Luka, wait.

34:32.779 --> 34:33.613
What?

34:35.114 --> 34:40.036
I just wanted to say that
despite what happened in the past,

34:40.119 --> 34:43.206
I'm really sorry about outing you.
It was really stupid of me.

34:43.915 --> 34:45.208
-Okay.
-Wait.

34:46.584 --> 34:50.213
But still, it was very nice
to hang out with you again.

34:50.296 --> 34:52.507
Maybe we could try to be friends.

34:55.843 --> 34:57.762
I don't think we can be friends.

34:58.429 --> 35:00.765
But thanks. Apologizing is always a start.

35:04.977 --> 35:06.020
Luka Colucci.

35:11.067 --> 35:13.361
Well, well, well. Look who it is.

35:15.363 --> 35:16.781
Thanks for coming, Dad.

35:17.949 --> 35:20.743
It feels great to know you sometimes care.

35:22.995 --> 35:25.373
This is a very Mexican song,
especially for you.

35:31.629 --> 35:35.800
<i>From your hands I learned</i>
<i>How to drink water</i>

35:37.802 --> 35:42.098
<i>I was like a sparrow caught in your cage</i>

35:44.058 --> 35:49.522
<i>I clipped my own wings</i>
<i>And the crumbs you offered</i>

35:50.064 --> 35:54.694
<i>Were never enough</i>
<i>And yet I loved you</i>

35:56.362 --> 36:00.700
<i>When I sang for you, it was whole-hearted</i>

36:02.451 --> 36:06.914
<i>Without you I couldn't take to the sky</i>

36:08.541 --> 36:14.672
<i>But you left me all alone</i>
<i>Confused and forgotten</i>

36:14.755 --> 36:20.511
<i>And a different hand</i>
<i>Offered me nourishment</i>

36:21.804 --> 36:25.683
<i>What once was will never be</i>

36:27.977 --> 36:31.939
<i>Don't look me up again</i>

36:34.150 --> 36:38.237
<i>I have nothing to give you</i>

36:38.863 --> 36:45.578
<i>I'm tired of your crumbs</i>

36:46.495 --> 36:49.707
<i>Fly awayâ¦</i>

36:49.790 --> 36:50.917
Mr. Colucci?

36:51.626 --> 36:54.170
Can you tell me anything
about RocÃ­o GarcÃ­a?

36:55.796 --> 36:57.381
I know she was your son's music teacher.

36:58.799 --> 37:02.803
<i>Perhaps you'll find another sparrow</i>

37:03.596 --> 37:05.681
<i>But make sure</i>

37:09.352 --> 37:13.814
<i>You keep it fed</i>

37:33.584 --> 37:35.294
<i>Are those fairy tears?</i>

37:35.920 --> 37:38.839
-What the hell?
-Come on, jerk.

37:38.923 --> 37:42.218
-Let go of me, asshole!
-Did you get a good video?

37:49.475 --> 37:52.061
Do you realize how dumb you are?

37:52.144 --> 37:52.979
Moron.

37:58.192 --> 37:59.485
Get off, asshole.

38:13.332 --> 38:15.334
-Have you seen Jana?
-No.

38:22.758 --> 38:23.759
I'm sorry.

38:27.513 --> 38:29.056
<i>Esteban Torres.</i>

38:39.900 --> 38:42.611
Good evening. I'm Esteban Torres.

38:46.449 --> 38:47.283
Sebas, get up.

38:48.659 --> 38:50.411
I couldn't sleep last night, sorry.

38:50.995 --> 38:53.414
I was inconsiderate. I was insensitive.

38:54.832 --> 38:57.585
But you accused me
of something I could never do, Jana.

38:59.545 --> 39:03.257
This song is very special.
I wrote it when I was six--

39:03.341 --> 39:05.551
Save us the <i>Behind the Music,Â </i>just play.

39:05.634 --> 39:06.761
-Emilia!
-What?

39:25.154 --> 39:26.781
Please forgive me.

39:26.864 --> 39:28.407
-Let's talk later.
-No.

39:29.742 --> 39:32.453
This is important.
You doubted me for a reason.

39:32.536 --> 39:35.122
-I really have to go.
-I don't want you to doubt me.

39:36.957 --> 39:39.210
Shouldn't you be judging the auditions?

39:40.127 --> 39:42.588
I don't care about that, Jana.
I care about you.

39:43.464 --> 39:45.424
You are my priority, our relationship.

39:45.508 --> 39:48.052
Okay, but I really have to go.

39:48.135 --> 39:49.553
It's that guy, isn't it?

39:52.098 --> 39:55.726
I'm here to fix us,
but you'd rather go to his audition.

39:55.810 --> 39:59.438
That's not all I care about,
but I promised I'd be there.

40:06.737 --> 40:09.949
What about your promise to me?
We're supposed to triumph together.

40:10.032 --> 40:12.201
You're choosing people
you literally just met.

40:12.284 --> 40:15.454
-That's not what "literally" means.
-I don't care.

40:16.288 --> 40:17.498
Make up your mind.

40:18.833 --> 40:20.835
I want to break up!

40:25.673 --> 40:28.676
Break up this conversationâ¦ for now.

41:16.307 --> 41:19.018
I'm sorry I didn't make it
to your audition.

41:19.727 --> 41:21.520
I swear I tried.

41:22.438 --> 41:23.272
It's okay.

41:23.355 --> 41:24.565
I mean,

41:25.399 --> 41:26.400
no big deal.

41:30.321 --> 41:31.572
Esteban?

41:45.836 --> 41:47.046
What about your boyfriend?

41:54.470 --> 41:57.264
<i>Jana Cohen GandÃ­a,</i>
<i>to the principal's office.</i>

41:57.765 --> 41:58.974
You'll be okay.

42:12.988 --> 42:14.865
Where are you going in such a hurry?

42:15.491 --> 42:16.450
Didn't you hear?

42:17.284 --> 42:19.161
The school board decided to expel me.

42:20.412 --> 42:22.873
Go ahead, laugh. It doesn't matter now.

42:22.957 --> 42:24.917
Spare me the drama.

42:25.834 --> 42:27.878
-I'm here to save you.
-What? How?

42:27.962 --> 42:31.590
All I know is, if you leave,
this place will be boring.

42:31.674 --> 42:34.468
You're like a bad movie
I can't stop watching.

42:41.225 --> 42:42.059
Have a seat.

42:45.437 --> 42:47.690
You can't get these in Argentina.
They're good.

42:47.773 --> 42:48.732
Just tell me.

42:51.819 --> 42:54.530
<i>This isn't good, Selena.</i>
<i>Don't get it twisted.</i>

42:55.197 --> 42:58.993
<i>-What are you doing with that?</i>
<i>-Whatever the hell we want.</i>

42:59.493 --> 43:01.495
I found this video
on FatÂ Kuri's cell phone.

43:05.499 --> 43:09.253
It was ten masked freaks,
probably seniors.

43:09.336 --> 43:12.464
They dragged us
out of our dorms to be hazed.

43:12.965 --> 43:14.258
I'll talk to the board.

43:17.177 --> 43:19.388
Can I still audition?

43:20.556 --> 43:22.057
<i>Jana Cohen GandÃ­a.</i>

43:26.478 --> 43:27.896
Yeah, Jana!

43:43.662 --> 43:45.956
<i>I looked for you</i>

43:47.708 --> 43:51.587
<i>From my depth one day</i>

43:51.670 --> 43:57.009
<i>And yet you couldn't understand</i>

44:00.179 --> 44:03.307
<i>My heart</i>

44:04.350 --> 44:08.354
<i>I gave you my heart</i>

44:08.437 --> 44:14.652
<i>And yet you couldn't see me clearly</i>

44:14.735 --> 44:19.948
<i>But I'm done</i>

44:20.032 --> 44:23.035
<i>I'm done waiting for you</i>

44:23.118 --> 44:30.084
<i>I'm sorry</i>
<i>But I'm done holding back</i>

44:31.418 --> 44:35.464
<i>This new feeling growing inside me</i>

44:35.547 --> 44:39.843
<i>Makes me stronger</i>
<i>Makes me resilient</i>

44:39.927 --> 44:43.764
<i>I'm no longer afraid</i>
<i>I'm staring ahead</i>

44:43.847 --> 44:48.268
<i>Freedom all around me</i>
<i>I can feel it</i>

44:48.352 --> 44:52.606
<i>I don't need anyone</i>
<i>I'm staring ahead</i>

44:52.690 --> 44:58.445
<i>I face the universe without fear</i>
<i>I know this is my moment</i>â¦

44:58.529 --> 45:00.781
EMILIA - CONGRATULATIONS! ROCKSTAR

45:00.864 --> 45:05.160
<i>There's nothing that can stop me</i>

45:05.244 --> 45:08.580
-You wanted to see me?
-I have a favor to ask.

45:24.555 --> 45:26.598
Bravo, Jana!

45:34.398 --> 45:37.276
There hasn't been a hazing
at EWS in 18 years.

45:47.453 --> 45:49.204
-It could beâ¦
-The Lodge.

45:49.288 --> 45:52.166
<i>Honestly, I always feltâ¦</i>

45:54.126 --> 45:55.502
I hope I'm wrong.

45:57.296 --> 45:58.922
<i>What are you doing with that?</i>

45:59.006 --> 46:01.592
<i>Whatever the hell I want.</i>

46:01.675 --> 46:03.343
<i>Come onâ¦</i>

46:06.764 --> 46:11.018
WE KNOW WHAT YOU DID, YOU'RE SCREWED

48:31.950 --> 48:33.702
