WEBVTT

00:03.129 --> 00:04.619
(birds chirping)

00:04.797 --> 00:08.415
( gate creaks, bangs )

00:16.267 --> 00:18.974
( panting )

01:05.608 --> 01:07.940
( gasps softly )

01:44.063 --> 01:46.395
(flies buzzing )

03:33.005 --> 03:35.337
(sighs)

03:53.401 --> 03:55.357
(theme music playing )

04:48.831 --> 04:51.447
( knocks )

05:00.176 --> 05:02.462
May I?

05:13.981 --> 05:16.393
That was, uh...

05:17.902 --> 05:21.019
that was quite
a speech you gave.

05:21.197 --> 05:24.439
Exactly what these people
needed to hear.

05:28.287 --> 05:30.152
What about the prison?

05:30.331 --> 05:34.370
As long as they leave us alone,
we have no problem.

05:34.543 --> 05:37.250
- So no retaliation?
- No.

05:37.421 --> 05:39.628
What would that get us?

05:39.798 --> 05:41.379
I need to go see them.

05:41.550 --> 05:44.292
( chuckles )

05:44.470 --> 05:47.428
I thought this place could be
something else, you know?

05:47.598 --> 05:50.340
Something better.

05:52.269 --> 05:55.102
I wasn't up to the challenge
and I screwed it up.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.065
I've done some terrible things.

06:01.612 --> 06:05.321
I'm not fit to lead
these people.

06:05.491 --> 06:08.153
But you are.

06:08.327 --> 06:11.114
They don't need
to be terrorized.

06:11.288 --> 06:12.824
Certainly not by
their own leader.

06:17.169 --> 06:19.034
You know, I really believed

06:19.213 --> 06:20.623
if I kept her alive
long enough,

06:20.798 --> 06:22.584
Milton would find a--

06:27.429 --> 06:29.920
ljust need time...

06:34.603 --> 06:36.889
to get myself together.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.814
So you want me
to fill in for you?

06:40.985 --> 06:44.352
Who else can?
Milton? Martinez?

06:49.410 --> 06:52.527
If you choose your friends in
the prison, l'd understand.

06:52.705 --> 06:55.492
But these people need you.

07:00.212 --> 07:02.544
we need you.

07:11.307 --> 07:13.298
( door closes)

07:14.935 --> 07:16.971
(urinating)

07:17.146 --> 07:20.229
There ain't nothing out here
but mosquitoes and ants.

07:20.399 --> 07:23.266
Patience, little brother.

07:23.444 --> 07:25.480
Sooner or later, a squirrel

07:25.654 --> 07:27.315
is bound to scurry
across your path.

07:27.489 --> 07:29.866
Even so,
that ain't much food.

07:30.034 --> 07:32.400
More than nothing.

07:34.204 --> 07:35.580
I'd have better luck going
through one of them houses

07:35.748 --> 07:37.079
we passed
back on the turnoff.

07:37.249 --> 07:40.912
Is that what your new friends
taught you? Hmm?

07:41.086 --> 07:43.577
How to loot for booty?

07:45.424 --> 07:47.335
We've been at it for hours.

07:47.509 --> 07:50.922
Why don't we find a stream,
try our luck with some fish?

07:51.096 --> 07:54.509
I think you'rejust trying to lead me
back to the road, man.

07:54.683 --> 07:57.220
- Get me over to that prison.
- They got shelter.

07:57.394 --> 08:00.557
Food.
A pot to piss in.

08:00.731 --> 08:02.847
Might not be a bad idea.

08:03.025 --> 08:04.856
For you, maybe.

08:05.027 --> 08:07.439
Ain't gonna be
no damn party for me.

08:09.782 --> 08:11.943
Everyone will get used
to each other.

08:14.244 --> 08:15.950
They're all dead.

08:16.121 --> 08:18.407
Makes no difference.

08:18.582 --> 08:20.618
How can you be so sure?

08:22.628 --> 08:25.745
Right about now he's probably
hosting a housewarming party

08:25.923 --> 08:28.960
where's he gonna bury
what's left of your pals.

08:29.134 --> 08:31.796
(spits)

08:31.970 --> 08:34.256
Let's hook some fish.

08:34.431 --> 08:36.422
Come on.

08:42.981 --> 08:45.563
Right.

08:47.152 --> 08:48.892
Now you said you found
Tyreese's group here?

08:49.071 --> 08:51.312
- Yeah.
- We secured this.

08:51.490 --> 08:54.402
He thought
he came through here.

08:57.162 --> 08:59.574
Means there's another breach.

09:00.999 --> 09:02.580
Okay.

09:02.751 --> 09:04.332
The whole front of
the prison is unsecure.

09:04.503 --> 09:06.084
If walkers
just strolled in,

09:06.255 --> 09:07.791
then it's gonna be cake
for a group of armed men.

09:07.965 --> 09:10.172
Why are we even so sure
he's going to attack?

09:10.342 --> 09:12.958
Maybe you scared him off.

09:13.137 --> 09:16.004
He had fish tanks
full of heads.

09:16.181 --> 09:18.638
Walkers and humans.
Trophies.

09:18.809 --> 09:21.175
He's coming.

09:21.353 --> 09:23.184
- We should hit him now.
- Beth: What?

09:23.355 --> 09:25.266
He won't be expecting it.

09:25.441 --> 09:27.306
We'll sneak back in
and put a bullet in his head.

09:27.484 --> 09:29.440
We're not assassins.

09:29.611 --> 09:31.602
You know where
his apartment is.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.190
You and I could
end this tonight.

09:33.365 --> 09:34.866
(sighs)

09:35.033 --> 09:37.900
I'll do it myself.

09:41.206 --> 09:42.946
Okay.

09:43.125 --> 09:45.707
He didn't know
you were coming last time

09:45.878 --> 09:48.210
and look what happened.

09:48.380 --> 09:49.995
You were almost killed.

09:50.174 --> 09:52.790
Daryl was captured.

09:52.968 --> 09:55.675
And you and Maggie
were almost executed.

09:55.846 --> 09:57.802
You can't stop me.

09:57.973 --> 09:59.713
Hershel:
Rick would never allow this.

09:59.892 --> 10:02.725
You really think he's in any
position to make that choice?

10:02.895 --> 10:06.058
Think this through clearly.
T-Dog lost his life here.

10:06.231 --> 10:08.222
Lori, too.
The men that were here.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.231
It isn't worth
any more killing.

10:10.402 --> 10:12.859
What are we waiting for?
If he's really on his way,

10:13.030 --> 10:14.691
we should be out
of here by now.

10:14.865 --> 10:17.197
- And go where?
- We lived on the road all winter.

10:17.367 --> 10:19.494
Back when you had two legs
and we didn't have a baby

10:19.661 --> 10:21.197
crying for walkers
every four hours.

10:21.371 --> 10:23.327
We can't stay here.

10:23.499 --> 10:25.330
We can't run.

10:38.013 --> 10:41.050
All right.
We'll stay put.

10:41.225 --> 10:42.886
We're gonna defend
this place.

10:43.060 --> 10:45.551
We're making a stand.

10:47.439 --> 10:49.851
Carl, you and lwill
go down to the tombs.

10:50.025 --> 10:51.356
We need to figure out
where the breach is.

10:51.527 --> 10:53.108
- You got it.
- Michonne: You'll need some help.

10:53.278 --> 10:55.769
No, in case anything happens,
I need you out here.

10:59.368 --> 11:01.609
Who's on watch?

11:01.787 --> 11:03.948
(sighs)

11:04.122 --> 11:06.113
Damn it.

11:15.467 --> 11:19.130
( pulsating tone)

11:33.944 --> 11:36.151
( gasps )

11:37.447 --> 11:39.438
Ahem.

11:40.909 --> 11:42.490
Alpha waves.

11:42.661 --> 11:45.243
l was trying to induce
a meditative state.

11:45.414 --> 11:47.325
I've been having trouble--

11:47.499 --> 11:49.785
your battery, it's over here.

11:55.591 --> 11:58.674
Man on radio: Okay, hold it.
Look at this jackpot.

11:58.844 --> 12:00.459
You've been invaluable.

12:05.684 --> 12:08.300
Do you intend to stay?

12:10.647 --> 12:12.899
Leaving's never
crossed my mind.

12:14.818 --> 12:17.184
Good.

12:17.362 --> 12:20.069
'Cause I count on you.
And not just for your--

12:20.240 --> 12:22.617
your expertise.

12:22.784 --> 12:25.400
But I consider
you a friend.

12:25.579 --> 12:28.070
|-- thank you.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.239
| feel--

12:30.417 --> 12:32.373
me, too.

12:32.544 --> 12:35.661
I counted on
Merle as well.

12:38.508 --> 12:41.671
Martinez,
he's a good soldier.

12:41.845 --> 12:44.757
He'd take a bullet
ifl needed him to.

12:48.393 --> 12:50.384
Would you?

12:51.772 --> 12:53.478
lwould.

12:53.649 --> 12:55.981
Yes.

12:57.569 --> 12:59.685
And Andrea?

13:01.198 --> 13:03.564
I'm not sure where
her loyalties lie.

13:03.742 --> 13:06.609
I can see how
her previous affiliation

13:06.787 --> 13:09.529
with Merle, no matter
how contentious it was,

13:09.706 --> 13:12.038
could cause doubt.

13:12.209 --> 13:14.746
You keep tabs
on her for me.

13:17.839 --> 13:19.921
Of course.

13:23.553 --> 13:24.679
( door bangs)

13:33.188 --> 13:35.099
Where's Martinez?

13:35.273 --> 13:36.729
I don't know.

13:36.900 --> 13:39.141
Did you see him leave?

13:39.319 --> 13:40.399
Yeah.

13:40.570 --> 13:43.232
Who was he with?

13:43.407 --> 13:45.318
Karen, it's okay.
You can tell me.

13:45.492 --> 13:48.780
I don't know anything.

13:52.791 --> 13:54.122
Milton.

13:54.292 --> 13:56.783
Milton, stop!

14:00.674 --> 14:02.881
You startled me.

14:03.051 --> 14:04.427
Where is he?

14:04.594 --> 14:05.754
Where's who?

14:05.929 --> 14:08.215
The Governor.

14:08.390 --> 14:10.426
He's out on a run?

14:10.600 --> 14:12.465
Is that an answer
or a question?

14:12.644 --> 14:15.386
I'm not sure...
where he is.

14:15.564 --> 14:17.930
I mean, not whether it was
a question or an answer.

14:18.108 --> 14:21.225
- It was an answer.
- A run meaning what specifically?

14:21.403 --> 14:23.610
Supplies would be
a safe bet.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.520
We were wiped out.

14:25.699 --> 14:27.280
Milton, I want you
to give me a specific answer

14:27.451 --> 14:30.784
to a specific question.
Where's the Governor?

14:30.954 --> 14:32.615
On a run?

14:32.789 --> 14:35.405
(sighs)

14:35.584 --> 14:37.950
You know, I bet
he'll be back soon.

14:38.128 --> 14:40.995
I'm sure he's okay,
if that's what you're worried about.

14:43.675 --> 14:45.666
The tombs outside the boiler
room are overrun again.

14:45.844 --> 14:47.334
That whole section
had been cleared.

14:47.512 --> 14:49.423
It's a steady
stream of walkers.

14:49.598 --> 14:51.839
Hershel:
We're wasting time.

14:52.017 --> 14:53.678
The Governor is supposedly
on the way

14:53.852 --> 14:55.467
and we're stuck
in here with walkers.

14:55.645 --> 14:57.260
Trapped between a rock
and a hard place.

14:57.439 --> 15:00.181
For the last time,
running is not an option.

15:00.358 --> 15:01.894
Carol: Glenn, if the tombs
have filled up again,

15:02.069 --> 15:04.025
it may just be a matter
of time before they push in here.

15:04.196 --> 15:05.561
Or until some fence
gives way.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.650
Axel: What if one of them herds
is passing through?

15:07.824 --> 15:09.360
Or settled?

15:09.534 --> 15:12.321
Can't handle that
with just the few of us.

15:12.496 --> 15:13.827
Okay.

15:13.997 --> 15:15.453
All right, we need--

15:15.624 --> 15:17.660
we just need to scout
the far side of the prison.

15:17.834 --> 15:19.916
- Find out what's going on.
- You're going out there?

15:20.087 --> 15:22.078
- Take a car and make it quick.
- |'|| drive.

15:22.255 --> 15:25.668
No, you stay here.
Help with the fortifications.

15:25.842 --> 15:27.503
I'll take Maggie.

15:27.677 --> 15:29.838
You sure she's up to that?

15:37.020 --> 15:39.557
( door opens)

15:51.493 --> 15:53.449
Where have you been?

16:00.585 --> 16:03.577
We need to find out how the walkers
are getting into the tombs.

16:10.137 --> 16:12.378
Are we gonna talk
about this?

16:16.268 --> 16:18.304
Maggie, you need
to talk about it.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.969
I do? Or you do?

16:22.941 --> 16:25.808
- What does that mean?
- What do you want me to say?

16:25.986 --> 16:27.942
You want me to say
he made me get naked

16:28.113 --> 16:29.774
and stand in front of him?

16:31.408 --> 16:34.571
He came up behind me.

16:34.744 --> 16:37.907
Pushed himself
against me.

16:39.374 --> 16:42.081
Put his hands
all over me.

16:42.252 --> 16:45.870
He slammed my head down
and bent me over a table.

16:48.592 --> 16:51.004
Did he...

16:51.178 --> 16:53.134
Rape me?

16:55.557 --> 16:57.138
No.

17:00.437 --> 17:03.725
No.

17:03.899 --> 17:05.935
Do you feel better?

17:07.569 --> 17:10.311
- I'm not trying to--
- I had a choice.

17:10.488 --> 17:13.855
Either I take off my shirt
or he would take off your hand.

17:14.034 --> 17:17.777
ljust listened to Merle beating
the shit out of you in the other room.

17:20.081 --> 17:22.823
What could I do?

17:25.337 --> 17:27.123
I'm sorry.

17:31.593 --> 17:33.675
Go away.

17:33.845 --> 17:35.426
You got your answer.

17:35.597 --> 17:37.758
Now go away.

17:55.533 --> 17:59.401
So we'll reinforce this with
some metal from the yard.

17:59.579 --> 18:02.696
If anything happens,

18:02.874 --> 18:05.160
we'll just duck.

18:05.335 --> 18:06.700
( laughs)

18:06.878 --> 18:08.493
lhope
nothing happens.

18:08.672 --> 18:10.879
Guns scare the bejesus
out of me.

18:12.425 --> 18:15.087
l robbed a gas station
with a toy gun.

18:15.262 --> 18:17.298
Never even took it
out of my pocket.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.930
You said Oscar
was the thief.

18:21.101 --> 18:23.262
That you were in here
for pharmaceuticals.

18:23.436 --> 18:26.143
Well, I didn't want y'all
to think l was a violent man.

18:26.314 --> 18:28.430
If you follow me.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.391
So what
are you saying?

18:31.569 --> 18:34.106
You're in here
for a toy gun?

18:34.281 --> 18:36.067
No, listen to this.

18:36.241 --> 18:38.983
The next day the cops found
me at my brother's house.

18:39.160 --> 18:41.492
Still had the water pistol
in my pocket.

18:43.498 --> 18:46.285
I swore up and down that
that was the only weapon I had,

18:46.459 --> 18:48.245
but they said they didn't believe
anyone could be

18:48.420 --> 18:49.580
so stupid and get away with it.

18:49.754 --> 18:51.870
So they turned my brother's
house upside down

18:52.048 --> 18:53.458
and found his .38.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.464
Said it "matched
the description."

18:55.635 --> 18:58.547
There you go.
Armed robbery.

18:58.722 --> 19:00.758
( laughs)

19:00.932 --> 19:04.470
Tell you the truth, I don't even know
how to use this damn thing.

19:06.521 --> 19:08.512
You're all about
the truth now?

19:08.690 --> 19:10.521
Yes, ma'am, I am.

19:10.692 --> 19:12.478
( clicks )

19:12.652 --> 19:14.938
lt's fully loaded.

19:17.699 --> 19:19.314
Let's hope
it stays that way.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.949
You're quite a lady.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.782
Hmm...
(chuckles)

19:31.921 --> 19:34.708
Merle: Smells to me like
the Sawhatchee Creek.

19:34.883 --> 19:36.839
Daryl:
We didn't go west enough.

19:37.010 --> 19:39.171
There's a river down there,
it's got to be the Yellow Jacket.

19:39.346 --> 19:41.211
You have a stroke, boy?

19:41.389 --> 19:43.801
We ain't never even come
close to Yellow Jacket.

19:43.975 --> 19:45.886
We didn't go west.

19:46.061 --> 19:47.801
Just a little bit south.
That's what I think.

19:49.147 --> 19:51.354
( scoffs )
Know what I think?

19:51.524 --> 19:53.901
I may have
lost my hand,

19:54.069 --> 19:55.309
but you lost your sense
of direction.

19:55.487 --> 19:57.853
Yeah, we'll see.

19:58.031 --> 19:59.487
What do you want to bet?

19:59.657 --> 20:01.693
I don't want
to bet nothing.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.654
It's just a body of water.

20:03.828 --> 20:05.659
Why's everything got
to be a competition with you?

20:05.830 --> 20:07.695
Whoa, whoa.
Take it easy, little brother.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.956
Just trying to have
a little fun here.

20:10.126 --> 20:11.741
No need to get
your panties all in a bundle.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.502
- You hear that?
- ( distant crying )

20:17.509 --> 20:20.046
- No, it's a baby.
- Oh, come on.

20:20.220 --> 20:22.552
Why don't you just piss in my ear
and tell me it's raining, too?

20:22.722 --> 20:25.008
That there's the sound
of a couple of coons

20:25.183 --> 20:27.014
making love, sweet love.
Know what I mean?

20:27.185 --> 20:28.550
( laughs)

20:28.728 --> 20:31.219
- ( walkers snarling )
- ( man yelling in Spanish)

20:33.942 --> 20:36.433
-( baby crying)
- ( gunshots)

20:36.611 --> 20:39.102
(whistles)
Hey! Jump!

20:39.280 --> 20:42.147
( laughs)

20:42.325 --> 20:44.281
What?

20:44.452 --> 20:46.443
Hey, man, I ain't
wasting my bullets

20:46.621 --> 20:49.203
on a couple of strangers
that ain't never cooked me a meal

20:49.374 --> 20:50.534
or felicitated my piece.

20:50.708 --> 20:52.323
That's my policy.

20:52.502 --> 20:54.709
You'd be wise
to adopt it, brother.

20:57.799 --> 20:58.834
( man shouts in Spanish )

21:02.971 --> 21:04.757
( gunshots)

21:08.101 --> 21:09.341
( baby crying )

21:09.519 --> 21:11.931
(speaking Spanish )

21:19.195 --> 21:21.982
(speaking Spanish )

21:35.086 --> 21:36.826
Daryl: Come on, man.
I'm trying to help you out.

21:37.005 --> 21:38.165
Cover me!

21:45.388 --> 21:48.425
(speaking Spanish )

21:52.187 --> 21:54.269
( screams )

21:57.025 --> 21:59.266
( growls )

22:08.786 --> 22:11.323
Daryl! I got ya!

22:13.458 --> 22:15.289
Go!

22:16.920 --> 22:19.582
- ( speaking Spanish )
- Speak English.

22:38.650 --> 22:41.858
(speaking Spanish )

22:53.456 --> 22:56.323
( baby crying )

23:02.757 --> 23:04.748
(shouting in Spanish )

23:04.926 --> 23:07.338
Slow down, beaner.

23:07.512 --> 23:10.128
That ain't no way
to say thank you.

23:10.306 --> 23:13.013
(speaking Spanish )

23:16.145 --> 23:18.181
Let 'em go.

23:20.024 --> 23:22.106
Relax.

23:22.277 --> 23:24.984
The least they
can do is give us

23:25.154 --> 23:27.645
an enchilada
or something, huh?

23:27.824 --> 23:30.406
Easy does it, seﬁorita.

23:30.577 --> 23:33.489
- ( sobbing )
- Everything's gonna be fine.

23:33.663 --> 23:36.245
-( rustling )
- Man #2: Hey! Hey!

23:36.416 --> 23:39.158
( man #1
speaking Spanish )

23:39.335 --> 23:41.872
( cans clanking )

23:44.173 --> 23:45.879
( bottle rattles )

23:47.385 --> 23:50.047
( sighs )
Get out of the car.

23:50.221 --> 23:53.679
I know you're not talking
to me, brother.

23:55.226 --> 23:57.308
Get in your car and get
the hell out of here.

23:57.478 --> 23:58.934
Go! Get in your car!

23:59.105 --> 24:00.686
( speaks Spanish )

24:03.860 --> 24:06.693
( car engine starts)

24:06.863 --> 24:08.979
( door closes)

24:11.075 --> 24:13.657
( squishes )

24:23.796 --> 24:26.663
(walkers moaning )

24:31.554 --> 24:34.011
(faint thunder rumbling)

24:40.605 --> 24:42.596
Merle: The shit you doing,
pointing that thing at me?

24:42.774 --> 24:44.560
They were scared, man.

24:44.734 --> 24:46.190
They were rude
is what they were.

24:46.361 --> 24:48.067
Rude and they owed us
a token of gratitude.

24:48.237 --> 24:49.818
They didn't owe us nothing.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.945
You helping people out of
the goodness of your heart?

24:52.116 --> 24:54.232
Even though you might
die doing it?

24:54.410 --> 24:55.991
Is that something
your Sheriff Rick taught you?

24:56.162 --> 24:57.197
There was a baby!

24:57.372 --> 25:00.239
Oh, otherwise you would have just
left them to the biters, then?

25:00.416 --> 25:03.783
Man, I went back for you.
You weren't there.

25:03.961 --> 25:06.873
I didn't cut off your hand, neither.
You did that.

25:07.048 --> 25:09.039
Way before they locked
you up on that roof.

25:09.217 --> 25:10.673
You asked for it.

25:13.930 --> 25:17.218
( chuckles ) You know--
you know what's funny to me?

25:17.392 --> 25:20.350
You and Sheriff Rick
are like this now.

25:20.520 --> 25:22.260
Right?

25:22.438 --> 25:24.053
I bet you a penny
and a fiddle of gold

25:24.232 --> 25:26.018
that you never told him

25:26.192 --> 25:27.898
that we were planning on
robbing that camp blind.

25:28.069 --> 25:30.151
It didn't happen.

25:30.321 --> 25:32.528
Yeah, it didn't 'cause I wasn't
there to help you.

25:32.699 --> 25:34.610
What, like when
we were kids, huh?

25:34.784 --> 25:36.945
- Who left who then?
- What?

25:37.120 --> 25:39.327
Huh? Is that why
I lost my hand?

25:39.497 --> 25:41.988
You lost your hand 'cause you're
a simpleminded piece of shit.

25:42.166 --> 25:43.667
Yeah?
You don't know!

25:43.835 --> 25:46.247
(shirt rips)

25:53.136 --> 25:55.218
|-- I didn't know he was--

25:55.388 --> 25:57.424
Yeah, he did.

25:57.598 --> 25:59.805
He did the same to you.

25:59.976 --> 26:02.433
That's why you left first.

26:03.771 --> 26:05.807
I had to, man.

26:05.982 --> 26:08.314
lwould have killed
him otherwise.

26:08.484 --> 26:10.941
Where you going?

26:11.112 --> 26:14.024
- Back where I belong.
- I can't go with you.

26:15.950 --> 26:18.566
I tried to kill
that black bitch.

26:18.745 --> 26:21.657
Damn near killed
the Chinese kid.

26:21.831 --> 26:23.696
He's Korean.

26:23.875 --> 26:26.207
Whatever.

26:26.377 --> 26:29.585
Doesn't matter, man.
ljust can't go with you.

26:31.257 --> 26:34.169
You know, I may be
the one walking away...

26:35.636 --> 26:38.343
but you're the one
that's leaving-- again.

26:55.448 --> 26:57.154
Damn.

26:59.827 --> 27:02.944
Glenn?

27:03.122 --> 27:05.534
Glenn!

27:19.013 --> 27:21.846
You're not going back
to Woodbury, are you?

27:23.184 --> 27:25.300
No.

27:25.478 --> 27:28.470
I'm just going out there.

27:28.648 --> 27:30.388
- I'll go with you.
- I got it.

27:30.566 --> 27:32.898
By yourself?

27:33.069 --> 27:35.981
How can you possibly think
that's a good idea?

27:36.155 --> 27:38.692
I can't just sit
on my hands.

27:38.866 --> 27:41.107
You went on a simple
formula run

27:41.285 --> 27:43.196
and got the crap
beat out of you.

27:43.371 --> 27:45.157
- Maggie was attacked.
- Are you saying this is my fault?

27:45.331 --> 27:46.912
- No.
- I did what I could.

27:47.083 --> 27:48.448
I know you did.

27:48.626 --> 27:50.366
So does Maggie.

27:50.545 --> 27:52.251
She's one of
the two people

27:52.421 --> 27:55.333
most precious to me
in this world.

27:58.427 --> 28:00.634
lstill do.

28:00.805 --> 28:04.389
This rage is going
to get you killed.

28:06.227 --> 28:09.435
With Daryl gone
and Rick wandering Crazytown,

28:09.605 --> 28:11.220
I'm the next in charge.

28:16.988 --> 28:19.320
What are you proving?

28:24.829 --> 28:26.945
(engine starts)

29:08.039 --> 29:10.325
She's hungry.

29:12.668 --> 29:14.124
Could you help me
feed her?

29:14.295 --> 29:16.752
I want to make Daddy
something to eat.

29:30.811 --> 29:32.802
Here.

29:40.071 --> 29:43.359
Just keep the bottle
like this.

29:43.532 --> 29:46.114
Otherwise she gets gassy.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.278
Got it.

30:05.638 --> 30:07.629
Here's this.

30:20.152 --> 30:22.404
Hershel: Rick.

30:31.163 --> 30:33.154
Rick.

30:38.838 --> 30:41.170
Rick.

31:08.993 --> 31:11.484
You know I wouldn't have
hobbled all the way down here

31:11.662 --> 31:13.869
if it wasn't important.

31:14.040 --> 31:17.328
Are you coming
back soon?

31:19.003 --> 31:21.289
Glenn's on the warpath.

31:21.464 --> 31:25.173
Smart as he is,
he can't fill your boots.

31:25.342 --> 31:27.333
I'm afraid he's reckless.

31:28.637 --> 31:31.299
We need you now
more than ever.

31:31.474 --> 31:33.760
Well, if you're
so worried about him,

31:33.934 --> 31:36.596
youlead.

31:36.771 --> 31:39.763
What are you doing
out here?

31:42.026 --> 31:44.392
l'v
e-

31:44.570 --> 31:47.027
I've been--

31:49.408 --> 31:51.865
I've got...

31:52.036 --> 31:53.901
stuff out here.

31:54.080 --> 31:56.787
Stuff.

31:56.957 --> 31:59.949
How much longer
do you need?

32:00.127 --> 32:03.164
I don't know.

32:03.339 --> 32:05.876
I don't--

32:07.510 --> 32:10.126
Is there anything
I can help you with?

32:22.775 --> 32:24.686
I saw something.

32:36.497 --> 32:38.533
Lori.

32:38.707 --> 32:40.447
I saw Lor--

32:40.626 --> 32:43.038
I'm seeing Lori.

32:45.923 --> 32:48.710
Look, I know
it's not really her.

32:50.970 --> 32:53.006
But there's got
to be a reason.

32:54.849 --> 32:58.433
It's got to mean
something, you know.

32:59.728 --> 33:01.889
Was it her on the phone?

33:02.064 --> 33:04.350
Yeah.

33:04.525 --> 33:06.436
Shane, too.

33:06.610 --> 33:09.226
And the town.

33:11.198 --> 33:13.280
Do you see them now?

33:18.539 --> 33:20.905
You're looking for them.

33:21.083 --> 33:24.041
I'm waiting.

33:24.211 --> 33:26.327
For what?

33:26.505 --> 33:29.838
I don't know. Something.

33:31.385 --> 33:34.047
There's an answer.

33:34.221 --> 33:37.213
I know
it doesn't make sense.

33:37.391 --> 33:39.427
Well, it does.
It can make sense.

33:39.602 --> 33:43.561
I mean, I think in time
it will make sense.

33:43.731 --> 33:45.062
Rick...?

33:45.232 --> 33:46.938
Come on in.

33:47.109 --> 33:49.350
You need rest.

33:52.156 --> 33:54.613
It's not safe out here.

34:00.164 --> 34:02.780
I can't. I can't.

34:25.272 --> 34:27.684
Stress getting
to your man Rick?

34:27.858 --> 34:29.064
Can you blame him?

34:29.235 --> 34:31.226
No. Not at all.

34:31.403 --> 34:34.361
ln here I've seen plenty
of dudes crack.

34:34.531 --> 34:36.567
But not me.

34:36.742 --> 34:39.700
I got on better
on the inside.

34:39.870 --> 34:42.862
Things made more sense,
you know?

34:43.040 --> 34:44.405
There were rules.

34:44.583 --> 34:47.871
Life was more simple.

34:50.714 --> 34:53.126
Didn't you miss
your brother?

34:53.300 --> 34:55.256
My brother?
( laughs )

34:55.427 --> 34:56.803
Hell, no.

34:56.971 --> 34:58.677
He had a real
money problem.

34:58.847 --> 35:01.224
- What kind of problem?
- He didn't lend me any.

35:01.392 --> 35:03.348
( both laugh )

35:03.519 --> 35:04.634
One time
that son of a bitch--

35:04.812 --> 35:06.973
(gunshot)

35:21.620 --> 35:23.360
(gunfire)

35:31.922 --> 35:33.913
Come here!

35:45.853 --> 35:48.014
( gasps )

36:26.268 --> 36:28.509
(gunfire stops)

36:36.236 --> 36:38.192
- ( door opens)
- Beth!

36:39.865 --> 36:42.732
- Here.
- ( gunfire resumes)

36:47.039 --> 36:48.324
Carol, go!

37:12.689 --> 37:14.816
( distant engine roaring )

37:25.828 --> 37:27.944
(engine roaring )

37:44.680 --> 37:46.011
( laughs)

37:53.147 --> 37:55.263
(engine roaring )

38:01.697 --> 38:03.813
(engine rumbling)

38:22.468 --> 38:23.878
(engine stops)

38:24.052 --> 38:26.839
(snarling )

38:42.946 --> 38:44.811
( clicks )

38:54.333 --> 38:57.917
Hershel.
Get the hell out of there!

39:25.280 --> 39:27.396
(snarling )

39:30.744 --> 39:32.484
( clicks )

39:48.428 --> 39:50.339
Oh!
