WEBVTT

01:37.472 --> 01:38.472
Just a moment.

01:42.519 --> 01:43.930
What is it, Mary?

01:57.034 --> 01:59.492
- What's happened?
- Up on the new bridge.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.282
He said something
bad happened.

02:01.413 --> 02:05.157
I found him down
on the Bowery.

02:05.292 --> 02:07.409
All right.

02:07.544 --> 02:09.001
There you go.

02:19.348 --> 02:21.965
My name is Dr. Kreizler.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.808
Can you tell me
what you saw?

02:31.234 --> 02:32.975
It's all right.

02:36.448 --> 02:38.940
Why was he wearin'
a dress?

02:39.076 --> 02:40.237
Sorry?

02:40.369 --> 02:42.235
The dead kid.

02:42.371 --> 02:46.115
He was dressed up
like a girl.

02:46.249 --> 02:49.492
Somebody cut him
to pieces.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.551
Are you sure
it was a boy?

03:06.687 --> 03:08.679
That's what
the cops said.

03:14.695 --> 03:17.608
Stevie?
Ready the calash.

03:17.739 --> 03:20.447
I need you to fetch Mr. Moore
and bring him to the bridge.

03:20.575 --> 03:23.113
Tell Moore to bring
his drawing kit.

03:23.245 --> 03:25.532
And tell him
I need details!

03:59.156 --> 04:01.489
Where were you this evening?

04:01.616 --> 04:03.073
At Mrs. Astor's.

04:03.201 --> 04:05.067
Was Jack there?

04:13.295 --> 04:14.295
I don't recall.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.387
What is it?

04:25.515 --> 04:28.007
Forgive me, John.

04:28.143 --> 04:29.179
I love him.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.013
Oh, for God's sake!

04:34.149 --> 04:36.391
Sorry to interrupt you,
Mr. Moore,

04:36.526 --> 04:39.644
but there is a young lad
here to see you.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.318
He says
it's very important.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.816
- What?
- Flora!

05:00.300 --> 05:01.757
Good evening, sir.

05:01.885 --> 05:03.376
What can't possibly wait,
Stevie?!

05:03.512 --> 05:05.003
He said he needs you.

05:07.349 --> 05:08.715
Hyah!

05:14.481 --> 05:16.063
Where on earth
are we going?

05:16.191 --> 05:19.810
The cops is there, so he said
he wanted you to go take a look.

05:19.945 --> 05:21.672
- Get out the way!
- Hyah! Move!

05:21.696 --> 05:22.732
Take a look at what?!

05:22.864 --> 05:24.526
Look out!

05:24.658 --> 05:27.071
- My God!
- Hey, watch it!

05:27.202 --> 05:30.536
Hang on!

05:30.664 --> 05:32.030
Roosevelt's there.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.872
You're gonna have to
talk your way up!

05:34.000 --> 05:35.832
For God's sake, Stevie,
up where?!

06:01.361 --> 06:03.398
Ah.
No further.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.132
And who might you be?

06:05.156 --> 06:08.069
John Moore.
I'm with "The New York Times."

06:08.201 --> 06:09.658
No reporters.

06:09.786 --> 06:13.325
I'm not a reporter.
I'm an illustrator.

06:13.456 --> 06:14.809
Well, then,
there's two good reasons

06:14.833 --> 06:16.324
for you not
to be going up there.

06:16.459 --> 06:19.452
Commissioner Roosevelt
sent for me.

06:25.719 --> 06:29.463
Well... we sure wouldn't want
to be disappointin'

06:29.598 --> 06:30.598
the commissioner.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.956
Moore? What the hell
are you doing here?

07:02.088 --> 07:03.249
Theodore.

07:03.381 --> 07:05.839
I gave strict instructions
not to allow anyone up.

07:05.967 --> 07:09.051
He said you sent for him,
Mr. Roosevelt.

07:09.179 --> 07:10.179
Kreizler sent me.

07:10.305 --> 07:12.297
I'm to capture an image.
I know nothing more.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.298
Then he's got no business
being here, sir.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.634
Especially if he's been sent
by that quacksalver doctor.

07:16.728 --> 07:18.845
Dr. Kreizler would not
have made the request

07:18.980 --> 07:20.516
had it not been important.

07:25.737 --> 07:28.650
Very well, Moore,
if you think you can stomach it.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.624
Get on, then.

08:15.286 --> 08:16.652
Where are her eyes?

08:16.788 --> 08:18.529
'Twas birds got 'em.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.372
Or rats.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.664
Somebody's done you up good,
young Giorgio.

08:23.795 --> 08:26.378
You're a hell of a mess.

08:26.506 --> 08:27.667
You know this child?

08:27.799 --> 08:29.085
I do.

08:29.217 --> 08:31.459
Giorgio Santorelli.

08:31.594 --> 08:35.837
He's a boy-whore,
worked out of Paresis Hall.

08:35.974 --> 08:38.091
'Twas was known as Gloria there,
though.

08:38.226 --> 08:39.342
Why must you call him
"it"?

08:39.477 --> 08:41.809
What else you call
a degenerate who dresses himself

08:41.938 --> 08:43.554
as a girl for the pleasure
of grown men?

08:43.690 --> 08:46.182
Enough! You say the boy worked
out of Paresis Hall?

08:46.317 --> 08:48.684
- Hmm.
- Who is the proprietor?

08:48.820 --> 08:51.187
That'd be Biff Ellison
and Paul Kelly what own it, sir.

08:51.322 --> 08:53.780
I want them
in my office tomorrow.

08:53.908 --> 08:55.177
But beggin' your pardon,
Commissioner,

08:55.201 --> 08:57.614
but summonin' a man
like Paul Kelly

08:57.746 --> 08:59.932
just because some little piece
of dago trash has been found...

08:59.956 --> 09:04.747
My office tomorrow or your badge
on my desk, Captain Connor.

09:06.171 --> 09:08.709
As you command,
Mr. Roosevelt.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.733
What kind of devil
could do such a thing?

10:23.164 --> 10:26.202
Fire setting in children
is often a sign of loneliness,

10:26.334 --> 10:28.371
not malice.

10:28.503 --> 10:31.337
Then there's
the bed-wetting.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.706
The medical term
is enuresis.

10:33.842 --> 10:36.209
Bed-wetting
has connotations of shame.

10:36.344 --> 10:38.961
That is unhelpful
to a child.

10:39.097 --> 10:44.138
The people who recommended you
said you treat adults, too.

10:44.269 --> 10:45.851
That is correct.

10:45.979 --> 10:49.222
But I've always found children's
minds to be more interesting.

10:49.357 --> 10:51.098
What we'd like to know, Doctor,

10:51.234 --> 10:52.520
is if you can cure Ezra.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.360
Before we end up
in a heap of ash.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.356
As an alienist, I treat mental
and emotional disorders

10:58.491 --> 11:01.529
in my patients, and I try
to alleviate their condition.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.994
I do not presume
to cure them.

11:11.296 --> 11:13.128
The exercise room
is over here.

11:13.256 --> 11:16.715
One, two, three, four.

11:16.843 --> 11:21.133
- Good, children.
- One, two, three, four.

11:21.264 --> 11:22.264
One, two, three, four.

11:22.265 --> 11:24.723
The music room
is down the hall.

11:24.851 --> 11:25.971
The dormitories
are upstairs,

11:26.060 --> 11:27.767
and you may have
seen the playground.

11:31.983 --> 11:34.726
You look as if you like
playing outdoors.

11:36.988 --> 11:38.729
The man's a fraud.

11:55.381 --> 11:56.747
It's good to see you.

11:56.883 --> 11:59.375
You've caused me
a sleepless night, Laszlo.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.376
The first of many,
I suspect.

12:01.512 --> 12:03.549
Forgive me,
but I had no choice.

12:03.681 --> 12:04.721
Roosevelt and his officers

12:04.849 --> 12:06.489
would have never
allowed me on that bridge

12:06.601 --> 12:08.763
and I thought they might be
better disposed to you.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.181
Did you know the child?

12:12.023 --> 12:13.730
Not this one.

12:15.026 --> 12:16.187
Do you have the drawings?

12:16.319 --> 12:17.152
Here.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.315
Thank you.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.016
Tell me what you saw.

12:57.151 --> 12:59.393
Tell you?

12:59.529 --> 13:01.691
It's all right there.
I've drawn it for you.

13:01.823 --> 13:03.780
You've idealized it.

13:03.908 --> 13:08.699
This looks like a martyred saint
in a Renaissance painting,

13:08.830 --> 13:10.617
not a mutilated child.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.416
It's no use to me.

13:14.544 --> 13:16.331
Well, if that's what
you think of my work,

13:16.462 --> 13:19.671
why did you drag me away
from a perfectly good evening

13:19.799 --> 13:22.166
to witness a sight that
will probably stay with me

13:22.302 --> 13:23.509
for the rest of my life?

13:25.388 --> 13:28.096
Because I need to see
what you saw.

13:29.892 --> 13:32.509
I need your help
in this matter, John.

13:36.524 --> 13:38.607
I saw a boy,

13:38.735 --> 13:40.852
dressed suggestively
in girl's clothing,

13:40.987 --> 13:42.899
who had been...

13:43.031 --> 13:45.865
It was as if an animal
had torn him apart.

13:45.992 --> 13:48.951
More specific.
Deep wounds or shallow?

13:49.078 --> 13:50.865
Precisely executed
or haphazard?

13:50.997 --> 13:53.364
Were the viscera exposed?
The guts, Moore.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.832
I know what viscera are.

14:01.549 --> 14:05.042
The boy's throat
had been cut to the bone.

14:06.471 --> 14:08.929
His right hand
was severed.

14:10.141 --> 14:13.555
His chest and abdomen
ripped open,

14:13.686 --> 14:16.178
and the innards
were left by his feet...

14:16.314 --> 14:21.105
a kidney and a lung,
I think.

14:21.235 --> 14:24.524
And his genitalia
had been removed.

14:27.116 --> 14:30.575
And birds had plucked out
his eyes.

14:31.996 --> 14:34.204
And his dress?

14:34.332 --> 14:35.994
A white dress.

14:38.461 --> 14:41.829
The same as any little girl
might wear.

14:52.725 --> 14:56.344
You still haven't told me
what this is about.

14:59.482 --> 15:02.225
Are you supposed to interview
the suspect?

15:04.028 --> 15:06.645
What suspect?

15:16.416 --> 15:17.577
I'm sorry, Dr. Kreizler.

15:17.708 --> 15:19.603
I wasn't told you were
consulting on these murders.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.539
Please don't concern yourself,
Dr. Fuller.

15:21.671 --> 15:23.482
I only just found out myself.

15:23.506 --> 15:25.338
And how did Mr. Wolff
come to be here?

15:25.466 --> 15:26.860
He was discovered
hiding in a warehouse

15:26.884 --> 15:28.216
down by the new bridge.

15:28.344 --> 15:30.882
The police had been looking
for him for a different murder.

15:31.013 --> 15:32.129
And do they know who?

15:32.265 --> 15:33.972
Another male prostitute
like himself.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.660
The police claimed
he stabbed his friend

15:35.726 --> 15:36.726
to death with a knife.

15:36.811 --> 15:37.891
Then, crazed by blood lust,

15:37.979 --> 15:39.390
went looking
for his next victim.

15:39.522 --> 15:42.686
No, no, no, no!

15:42.817 --> 15:44.934
Has anyone questioned him,
aside from the police?

15:45.069 --> 15:46.150
One of the wardens tried,

15:46.279 --> 15:48.111
but Wolff
almost gouged his eyes out.

15:49.574 --> 15:52.157
Accompany them.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.322
Thank you, Dr. Fuller.

16:03.713 --> 16:05.545
Settle down.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.457
May I ask what you're hoping
to achieve with this exercise,

16:21.481 --> 16:22.481
Mr. Wolff?

16:25.151 --> 16:28.110
The police
have the lion's share.

16:36.037 --> 16:38.370
My name is Dr. Kreizler.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.161
I sometimes work as an alienist
for the courts.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.998
Tell me, Doctor,

16:46.130 --> 16:48.087
can you cure this?

16:50.593 --> 16:53.461
There's no cure
for advanced syphilis.

17:03.147 --> 17:05.638
You have been charged with
the murders of Edwin Band and...

17:05.775 --> 17:07.892
Edwin deserved it!

17:08.027 --> 17:10.359
I'd kill him again if I could.

17:10.488 --> 17:12.605
And the boy?

17:12.740 --> 17:14.902
You're accused of cutting him
to pieces.

17:18.996 --> 17:21.032
Yes.

17:23.125 --> 17:25.492
Police said you knew him
from Paresis Hall.

17:31.676 --> 17:33.963
Do I look like a boy
to you?

17:35.805 --> 17:38.218
I wouldn't step foot
in that molly house

17:38.349 --> 17:40.762
full of rich pansies.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.725
What are you looking at?

17:45.690 --> 17:47.977
Do I stimulate you?

17:53.948 --> 17:55.564
Does he remind you
of Edwin?

17:56.993 --> 17:59.110
Guard, please,
open the door.

18:00.538 --> 18:02.074
Open the door!

18:02.206 --> 18:04.072
- Back up!
- Laszlo.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.200
What are you doing?

18:07.211 --> 18:08.497
Laszlo.

18:25.021 --> 18:27.388
How do you know
I won't hurt you?

18:30.735 --> 18:33.694
You stabbed Edwin
20 times.

18:42.580 --> 18:45.323
He must have
hurt you deeply.

18:58.679 --> 19:01.217
What color
were Edwin's eyes?

19:03.976 --> 19:06.013
Green.

19:08.564 --> 19:12.399
The color of envy.
He found someone else.

19:19.909 --> 19:21.571
What color
were Giorgio's eyes?

19:40.554 --> 19:43.342
You did not kill that boy,
did you?

19:46.435 --> 19:48.552
No, I didn't.

19:59.532 --> 20:00.532
Doctor?

20:02.993 --> 20:04.404
What'll take me first?

20:05.621 --> 20:08.534
The gallows or the pox?

20:08.666 --> 20:11.579
I'm afraid in New York State,
it'll be the electric chair.

20:11.711 --> 20:16.172
Either way,
the pain will be gone soon.

20:30.563 --> 20:31.770
Captain Connor?

20:31.897 --> 20:34.685
Did he do it?
Was there a confession?

20:34.817 --> 20:37.025
Let's just say, Linc,
we gave him a little bit

20:37.153 --> 20:39.145
of the third degree,
and he melted like butter.

20:40.656 --> 20:42.192
Uh, Chief Byrnes?

20:42.324 --> 20:44.691
You have anything to do with
apprehending this Wolff fellow?

20:44.827 --> 20:45.827
No.

20:45.953 --> 20:47.535
I was just passing by
to congratulate

20:47.663 --> 20:48.995
Captain Connor here.

20:49.123 --> 20:51.285
I'm retired, as you know,
but I take great pride

20:51.417 --> 20:52.874
in the achievement
of my boys.

20:53.002 --> 20:54.493
I'm Sergeant Doyle.

20:54.628 --> 20:56.314
What do you think of the new
commissioner's policies

20:56.338 --> 20:57.454
on department reform?

20:57.590 --> 21:01.129
I say we give Mr. Roosevelt
all the rope he wants.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.863
We'll see if he doesn't soon
hang himself with it.

21:02.887 --> 21:05.004
A-And a quote, sir?

21:05.139 --> 21:06.491
W-What have you been
doing with your time

21:06.515 --> 21:08.472
now that you're no longer
chief of police?

21:08.601 --> 21:10.888
Speculating on Wall Street.

21:11.020 --> 21:12.886
Mr. Morgan and some
of his associates

21:13.022 --> 21:14.763
have been most generous
with their advice.

21:14.899 --> 21:16.168
- There's Kreizler.
- Dr. Kreizler!

21:16.192 --> 21:17.603
Dr. Kreizler,
a moment of your time.

21:21.071 --> 21:23.814
As an alienist, have you been
asked to get another madman...

21:32.208 --> 21:34.575
<i>Dr. Kreizler!</i>

21:34.710 --> 21:35.917
<i>Dr. Kreizler!</i>

21:47.765 --> 21:50.223
<i>Dr. Kreizler.</i>

21:50.351 --> 21:53.685
<i>That's him.
I've heard about him.</i>

22:19.296 --> 22:20.878
Miss?

22:24.301 --> 22:25.462
John Moore.

22:25.594 --> 22:28.052
- Hello.
- What are you doing here?

22:28.180 --> 22:31.264
I've, um... W-We've come
to see the commissioner.

22:31.392 --> 22:33.304
- Sara and I...
- I am Miss Howard,

22:33.435 --> 22:35.235
an employee of the New York
Police Department.

22:35.312 --> 22:36.748
You will please accord me
the respect

22:36.772 --> 22:38.889
that my position demands.

22:39.024 --> 22:42.483
Our families
have long been acquainted.

22:42.611 --> 22:45.024
Miss Howard is the first woman
to hold a position

22:45.155 --> 22:47.195
- with the police department.
- Excellent.

22:47.324 --> 22:49.553
Perhaps Miss Howard can help
arrange an impromptu meeting

22:49.577 --> 22:50.818
with the commissioner?

22:50.953 --> 22:52.865
And how should I
help do that?

22:52.997 --> 22:57.367
With my "especially rosy mouth"
or my "sparkling blue eyes"?

22:57.501 --> 22:59.788
- Sara, I did not...
- Miss Howard.

22:59.920 --> 23:03.504
Certainly, Miss Howard,
it was a society feature,

23:03.632 --> 23:06.090
and I only drew
the illustration.

23:06.218 --> 23:07.834
You don't have
an appointment.

23:07.970 --> 23:11.429
Let me introduce you
to Dr. Laszlo Kreizler.

23:11.557 --> 23:12.593
Dr. Kreizler.

23:14.184 --> 23:15.641
I've read your work.

23:17.479 --> 23:18.720
I found it fascinating.

23:19.690 --> 23:21.022
Most of it.

23:21.150 --> 23:23.483
Laszlo and I attended
Harvard together,

23:23.611 --> 23:24.772
along with
the commissioner.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.691
We're all old friends,
you see,

23:26.822 --> 23:28.563
which is why a surprise
is in order.

23:28.699 --> 23:30.736
Oh, no, but you can't
just go in there without...

23:37.625 --> 23:39.491
Hello, my friend.

23:43.589 --> 23:46.878
Moore. I might have suspected
you were behind this ambush.

23:47.009 --> 23:48.486
I told them
they needed an appointment.

23:48.510 --> 23:49.988
Laszlo has something important
he would like to s...

23:50.012 --> 23:52.172
The man being held for the
murder of the Santorelli boy

23:52.222 --> 23:54.259
is quite innocent
of the charge.

23:54.391 --> 23:56.053
And just how
would you know that?

23:56.185 --> 23:57.517
Because I interviewed him.

23:57.645 --> 23:59.056
On whose authority?

23:59.188 --> 24:01.020
My own.

24:01.148 --> 24:04.437
As usual,
you've overstepped your bounds.

24:04.568 --> 24:06.685
Stabbing a grown man
in a heated argument

24:06.820 --> 24:08.660
and the methodical disemboweling
of a young boy

24:08.781 --> 24:10.568
are very different things.

24:10.699 --> 24:12.782
I'm well aware of your theories,
Kreizler.

24:12.910 --> 24:17.075
But at this juncture,
your expertise is not required.

24:17.206 --> 24:20.074
I took it upon myself
to interview your suspect

24:20.209 --> 24:24.203
because of an unsolved case
three years ago.

24:24.338 --> 24:29.208
The Zweig twins...
Benjamin and Sofia.

24:29.343 --> 24:31.005
The boy was a patient
of mine.

24:31.136 --> 24:32.297
His parents brought him in

24:32.429 --> 24:34.512
because he wished
to dress as his sister.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.051
And one day,
they both disappeared

24:36.183 --> 24:37.890
while outside playing.

24:38.018 --> 24:39.496
At first, it was thought
they had run away,

24:39.520 --> 24:43.104
but then their bodies were found
in a rooftop water tank.

24:43.232 --> 24:45.144
The body of the girl
was unremarkable.

24:45.275 --> 24:48.359
However, the boy was cut
from sternum to pubis,

24:48.487 --> 24:50.820
his innards displayed.

24:50.948 --> 24:52.234
What are you suggesting?

24:52.366 --> 24:54.733
That the Zweig murders
and the present one

24:54.868 --> 24:56.029
are works of theater,

24:56.161 --> 24:58.323
inspired by
the same imagination.

25:00.833 --> 25:03.041
One person committed
both crimes?

25:03.168 --> 25:04.955
Yes.

25:06.088 --> 25:09.707
Gentlemen, I think this may be
a little indelicate.

25:14.471 --> 25:15.471
Miss Howard.

25:21.812 --> 25:23.553
And what is it
you want from me?

25:23.689 --> 25:25.709
I shall need to look at the
postmortem of the Zweig case

25:25.733 --> 25:28.521
to see if there's a connection,
if one indeed exists.

25:28.652 --> 25:31.520
I cannot allow that.
It is neither legal nor ethical.

25:31.655 --> 25:34.989
Murderers like this exist
whether you accept it or not.

25:35.117 --> 25:37.279
If I'm correct,
your men will be ill-equipped

25:37.411 --> 25:38.891
to fathom the motives
of a perpetrator

25:38.996 --> 25:41.033
with an impulse
to butcher young boys.

25:41.165 --> 25:42.531
Furthermore,
I should like access

25:42.666 --> 25:43.998
to additional police records

25:44.126 --> 25:46.286
to see if there are other
victims that you have missed.

25:46.336 --> 25:48.481
I should have known when
I let Moore up on that bridge,

25:48.505 --> 25:50.462
I'd be inviting
this sort of incursion.

25:50.591 --> 25:52.548
I cannot permit you
nor any other outsider

25:52.676 --> 25:54.963
access to privileged
information.

25:55.095 --> 25:57.678
Just because you live by
your own set of rules, Kreizler,

25:57.806 --> 25:59.172
does not mean I do.

25:59.308 --> 26:01.846
Wolff did not kill
that boy.

26:01.977 --> 26:03.468
And that won't change,

26:03.604 --> 26:06.312
no matter how many times
your men put a boot to him.

26:25.918 --> 26:27.910
My God, Laszlo,
sometimes you can be

26:28.045 --> 26:29.911
as subtle as a blowtorch.

26:30.047 --> 26:32.209
How long have you known
Miss Howard?

26:32.341 --> 26:34.003
Oh, no.

26:34.134 --> 26:35.670
Long enough
to ask her a favor?

26:35.803 --> 26:37.135
I won't do it.

26:37.262 --> 26:40.926
I will not ask Miss Howard
to get you the Zweig file.

26:41.058 --> 26:42.515
Well...

26:42.643 --> 26:45.807
Someone has to illustrate
the society pages, I suppose.

27:11.630 --> 27:12.630
Excuse me.

27:12.756 --> 27:15.169
Oh, no, no, c-come right in,
Miss Howard.

27:15.300 --> 27:17.838
We've nothing to hide here, huh?

27:17.970 --> 27:19.757
The commissioner
would like a word.

27:19.888 --> 27:22.551
Miss Howard?
Mind your petticoat.

27:22.683 --> 27:24.595
There's a sizable
hairless rat

27:24.726 --> 27:26.683
been spotted about
the station house.

27:28.438 --> 27:30.475
Funny, Captain Connor.

27:31.275 --> 27:33.562
I see only
a little pink mouse.

27:35.779 --> 27:37.520
I like her
even more now!

27:44.913 --> 27:46.745
Miss Howard.

27:46.874 --> 27:48.410
Now what?

27:48.542 --> 27:50.374
I have something to ask you.

27:50.502 --> 27:51.913
Yes?

27:52.045 --> 27:53.911
May I address you as Sara?

27:54.047 --> 27:57.040
You may, but exclusive
of my official duties.

27:57.176 --> 27:59.543
Sara, I would very much like to
ask you

27:59.678 --> 28:02.637
to get me the file
on the Zweig case.

28:02.764 --> 28:05.222
Have you lost your mind,
John Moore? I mean, honestly.

28:05.350 --> 28:06.807
It would only be to borrow it.

28:06.935 --> 28:08.496
It will be returned
with no one the wiser.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.227
I'll be the wiser.

28:10.355 --> 28:11.516
Kreizler needs the file.

28:13.192 --> 28:14.308
Did he send you?

28:14.443 --> 28:16.480
No.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.896
Regardless, I will not
betray the trust

28:20.032 --> 28:21.176
the commissioner
has shown in me.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.317
Not for Dr. Kreizler,
nor for anyone else.

28:23.452 --> 28:26.115
Sara, please.

28:26.246 --> 28:27.987
We need your help.

28:45.390 --> 28:50.510
Our graft paid for
this building, Commissioner.

28:50.646 --> 28:52.353
And lined the pockets
of your men.

28:53.440 --> 28:54.681
And now you drags us in here

28:54.816 --> 28:56.648
like a couple of two-bit
sneak thieves

28:56.777 --> 29:00.111
when you already got
your throat slitter behind bars.

29:00.239 --> 29:02.356
Now, where's the decency, huh?

29:02.491 --> 29:04.153
Might you have a pen,
Mr. Ellison?

29:08.664 --> 29:09.700
Thank you, Mr. Kelly.

29:09.831 --> 29:12.824
I think what Mr. Ellison
is trying to say here,

29:12.960 --> 29:15.168
Commissioner,
is that we are businessmen.

29:16.046 --> 29:18.208
In fact, we have enjoyed
an understanding

29:18.340 --> 29:20.957
with the police
over the years.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.927
And after all the profit
from your pandering, gambling,

29:24.054 --> 29:25.920
and intimidation,

29:26.056 --> 29:29.265
how much do you make
from this understanding?

29:29.393 --> 29:31.635
A great deal.

29:36.108 --> 29:38.600
Well, here's something else
for you to understand.

29:38.735 --> 29:40.146
A child is dead.

29:40.279 --> 29:42.145
A child exploited by you
and your brothel.

29:42.281 --> 29:45.194
No more.
I want Paresis Hall shut down.

29:45.325 --> 29:48.568
- Shut down?
- You have until 6:00 today.

29:48.704 --> 29:49.704
You can't do that.

29:49.705 --> 29:51.162
I think the commissioner
is right.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.282
Best we close our doors
on account

29:53.417 --> 29:55.784
of this sad turn of events.

30:00.966 --> 30:03.458
- Here you go.
- Watch yourself!

30:06.221 --> 30:08.929
Get the hell out of here!

30:11.018 --> 30:12.725
Look out!

30:16.690 --> 30:18.397
Move your fannies now, girls.

30:18.525 --> 30:20.391
We open for business
in less than an hour.

30:20.527 --> 30:23.611
And Jesus died on the cross
for your sins!

30:23.739 --> 30:25.696
Never seen a girl before?

30:34.833 --> 30:35.833
Step right up!

30:35.959 --> 30:38.417
Come on,
put your backs into it!

30:38.545 --> 30:40.787
I took out a ten-spot
to cover the inconvenience

30:40.922 --> 30:42.288
of closin' down.

30:42.424 --> 30:45.462
But you're only shiftin' 'em
across the street.

32:30.949 --> 32:33.407
Will that be all, miss?

32:47.549 --> 32:49.711
I can't decide whether
they abhor our shape

32:49.843 --> 32:50.924
or crave another.

32:51.052 --> 32:55.638
They believe us to be
delicate creatures, miss.

32:55.765 --> 32:58.007
Then to hell with them.

33:50.612 --> 33:52.274
Miss Howard.

33:54.658 --> 33:55.694
How did you find me?

33:55.825 --> 33:57.428
Your grandmother didn't
know where you were,

33:57.452 --> 34:00.195
so I asked one
of your sporting companions.

34:00.330 --> 34:02.308
He told me you were particularly
fond of this house

34:02.332 --> 34:04.101
and could be found
slumming it here most nights.

34:07.754 --> 34:09.871
This is an unsavory
neighborhood for a young lady.

34:10.005 --> 34:11.793
I'm not here on savory business,

34:11.925 --> 34:14.284
and every panderer, mawk, lush,
and billy noodle in the city

34:14.386 --> 34:16.030
pass through the doors
of the police department,

34:16.054 --> 34:17.989
not to mention the mutton
shunters that I work with.

34:18.014 --> 34:20.630
So please don't concern yourself
with my blushes.

34:20.766 --> 34:23.100
I've come to return your work.

34:25.981 --> 34:28.849
And to give you the file
Dr. Kreizler asked for.

34:33.237 --> 34:34.438
I don't know how to thank you.

34:34.489 --> 34:36.196
If Dr. Kreizler finds
anything of interest

34:36.324 --> 34:39.533
in these particular documents,
I should like to be told.

34:39.661 --> 34:41.744
That is the only thanks
I require.

34:53.300 --> 34:54.541
I have it!

34:59.264 --> 35:00.345
Laszlo!

35:02.058 --> 35:04.892
I've got the Zweig file.

35:07.772 --> 35:09.980
I do hope
you thanked Miss Howard.

35:35.967 --> 35:38.004
Well, what have you found?

35:38.136 --> 35:40.674
There's nothing here.

35:41.848 --> 35:43.714
No details
as to the kind of wounds,

35:43.850 --> 35:46.558
no sense
of how they were inflicted.

35:46.686 --> 35:49.804
I... I need evidence.

Excuse me, ma'am.
Ma'am.

37:46.014 --> 37:49.678
I can only imagine
how you must be feeling, but...

37:49.809 --> 37:52.517
let me assure you that the
disinterment was unfortunate,

37:52.645 --> 37:54.352
but necessary, Mrs. Zweig.

37:56.399 --> 37:57.731
Hmm.

38:00.528 --> 38:03.521
I read about
the boy on the bridge.

38:06.701 --> 38:08.784
About what he was wearing.

38:10.830 --> 38:13.493
Your son's desire to wear
the same clothing as his sister

38:13.625 --> 38:16.038
has little in common
with the boy on the bridge.

38:16.169 --> 38:18.752
You said there was
no need for concern.

38:21.800 --> 38:25.794
You said our acceptance of
Benjamin was what mattered most.

38:29.849 --> 38:32.683
And we believed you.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.643
We trusted you.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.232
Giorgio Santorelli
dressed as he did

38:40.360 --> 38:42.693
because he was a prostitute.

38:42.821 --> 38:45.313
Benjamin was only following
his nature.

38:51.996 --> 38:53.703
Mrs. Zweig...

38:54.999 --> 38:58.163
...your son was the victim
of a very disturbed mind.

39:02.966 --> 39:04.958
My Benjamin is dead.

39:09.389 --> 39:12.803
Both my children are dead.

39:14.978 --> 39:16.844
Because of you.

39:52.348 --> 39:54.135
Gentlemen,
this is John Moore,

39:54.267 --> 39:55.508
a friend and colleague.

39:55.643 --> 39:57.883
Hello, Mr. Moore. I'm Detective
Sergeant Marcus Isaacson.

39:57.979 --> 39:59.060
This is my brother, Lucius.

39:59.188 --> 40:01.805
Detective Sergeant
Lucius Isaacson.

40:01.941 --> 40:03.544
Theodore didn't trust
the coroner's office

40:03.568 --> 40:06.356
to keep silent about
revisiting the Zweig case.

40:06.487 --> 40:08.979
It was good of Commissioner
Roosevelt to lend you to us.

40:09.115 --> 40:11.903
May I ask how long we have
the benefit of your expertise?

40:12.035 --> 40:13.321
As long as you like, Doctor.

40:13.453 --> 40:15.806
I doubt my brother and I will be
missed at the police department.

40:15.830 --> 40:19.665
I imagine your modern methods
don't make you very popular.

40:19.792 --> 40:21.033
That and the fact we're Jews.

40:22.045 --> 40:24.378
Has the commissioner told you
what this is about?

40:24.505 --> 40:26.292
Only that we're to perform
an autopsy

40:26.424 --> 40:28.416
and keep the results
strictly confidential.

40:29.886 --> 40:32.924
Benjamin and Sofia Zweig.
Their bodies were discovered...

40:33.056 --> 40:35.056
Three years ago in a water tower
on Suffolk Street.

40:35.183 --> 40:37.300
- We read the file.
- The injuries to the boy

40:37.435 --> 40:39.552
are what interests me
the most.

40:45.193 --> 40:47.810
You've heard about the
Santorelli murder, I assume?

40:47.946 --> 40:49.357
Of course.

40:50.615 --> 40:51.967
If you're looking
for similarities,

40:51.991 --> 40:54.261
there's only so much we can tell
from a body in this state.

40:54.285 --> 40:57.449
I want you to look at
what remains...

40:57.580 --> 41:01.290
each bone, each fragment
for every detail, every mark,

41:01.417 --> 41:03.750
no matter how insignificant.

41:05.630 --> 41:07.838
Anything that may connect
Benjamin Zweig

41:07.966 --> 41:09.377
to the Santorelli boy.

41:09.509 --> 41:11.671
We will do our best, Doctor.

41:17.433 --> 41:20.642
Get the "Tribune"!
Get the "Tribune"!

41:21.688 --> 41:23.896
Get the "Tribune"!
Get the "Tribune"!

41:24.023 --> 41:26.231
They won't be finished
for quite some time.

41:26.359 --> 41:28.521
I thought we might get
an early dinner somewhere.

41:28.653 --> 41:30.610
How can you think
of eating now?

41:30.738 --> 41:33.105
I don't recall you being
so delicate.

41:33.241 --> 41:34.698
I'm afraid once seen,

41:34.826 --> 41:37.614
those images
will remain forever in my head.

41:39.205 --> 41:42.539
That's what I admire
about you, John.

41:42.667 --> 41:44.829
You represent the good
that people want to believe

41:44.961 --> 41:46.372
is in all of us.

41:46.504 --> 41:49.121
It's why people like you more
than they do me.

42:07.316 --> 42:08.523
Thank you, Cyrus.

42:22.665 --> 42:24.657
Get the "Tribune"!
Get the "Tribune"!

42:31.799 --> 42:33.210
Come!

42:37.180 --> 42:38.762
- Cyrus!
- Sir?

42:38.890 --> 42:40.492
Were you away from the carriage
at any point?

42:40.516 --> 42:42.553
No, sir.

42:42.685 --> 42:44.768
What?
Do you see something?

42:57.867 --> 42:59.483
There.

43:01.662 --> 43:03.870
Laszlo!

43:09.504 --> 43:10.585
Laszlo!

43:55.007 --> 43:56.839
Laszlo!

44:50.271 --> 44:51.512
Laszlo!

45:38.986 --> 45:40.318
Laszlo!

45:47.286 --> 45:48.697
Where did he go?

46:06.764 --> 46:09.302
Did you see
the Santorelli boy's mouth?

46:22.029 --> 46:23.861
I'm certain
cold-blooded killers

46:23.990 --> 46:24.990
walk among us.

46:29.328 --> 46:32.071
They're out there now, hidden,

46:32.206 --> 46:34.368
yet their motives
are understandable,

46:34.500 --> 46:37.459
but this one is different.

46:38.754 --> 46:41.497
His acts are so wretched,
so evil that...

46:42.508 --> 46:45.717
...only if I become him,

46:45.845 --> 46:48.508
if I cut
the child's throat myself...

46:50.266 --> 46:52.383
...if I run my knife
through the helpless body

46:52.518 --> 46:55.181
and pluck innocent eyes
from a horrified face...

46:56.522 --> 47:00.266
...only then will I come
to truly understand what I am.

47:00.401 --> 47:02.688
Only then will I recognize
that what drives me

47:02.820 --> 47:05.813
is not an absence of emotion
at all.

47:05.948 --> 47:08.361
Rather, a torrent of feeling.

47:08.492 --> 47:10.028
The kind that gives meaning
and purpose

47:10.161 --> 47:11.868
to my own blackened soul.

47:13.831 --> 47:16.744
I must see life
as he sees it.

47:17.752 --> 47:20.244
Feel pain as he feels it.

47:21.297 --> 47:24.210
Take the same path he takes.

47:24.342 --> 47:25.753
Yes.

47:25.885 --> 47:28.093
I must follow this
wherever it goes.

47:29.847 --> 47:33.591
Even if it leads me
to the darkest pit of hell.

47:40.358 --> 47:42.020
What's wrong, child?

47:46.739 --> 47:53.739
♪ Just a song at twilight ♪

47:53.954 --> 47:59.575
♪ When the lights are low ♪

47:59.710 --> 48:06.002
