WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:02.703
[Mike] Previously
on Designated Survivor...

00:02.836 --> 00:05.419
[Tom] I'm your older brother.
I'm supposed to help you get through things.

00:05.547 --> 00:07.925
Whatever I think happened
doesn't matter anymore.

00:08.050 --> 00:10.382
-'Cause we're family?
-Yeah.

00:10.511 --> 00:12.297
If you're not sure about us--

00:12.429 --> 00:14.796
-I don't know.
-I do. When you do, give me a call.

00:14.932 --> 00:17.094
Why am I wearing an ankle bracelet
when I'm helping?

00:17.226 --> 00:19.809
It's that or a 30-year term for espionage.

00:19.937 --> 00:22.429
The knowledge that Damian has
belongs to us.

00:22.564 --> 00:24.726
If anything happens to him,
you will regret it.

00:26.818 --> 00:28.104
[intruder grunts]

00:28.237 --> 00:31.901
You leaked intel to Valeria that I was alive
to see if the Russians wanted me dead.

00:32.031 --> 00:33.898
They didn't. They knew
you could help us solve the hack.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.945
Which is why the hacker wanted you dead.

00:37.871 --> 00:41.364
Senator, what qualities do you possess
that would make you a great vice president?

00:41.500 --> 00:44.618
The question is, sir,
what qualities don't I have?

00:45.212 --> 00:47.419
[smacks lips]
Why don't we talk about my agenda?

00:48.131 --> 00:49.462
I'll champion it, of course.

00:50.634 --> 00:51.749
What if I'm wrong?

00:51.885 --> 00:55.128
Unconditional loyalty.
That's what you get from me.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.675
As much as I appreciate the sentiment,

00:57.808 --> 01:00.470
I'm interested in working
with someone who would feel comfortable

01:00.602 --> 01:03.640
about being able to tell me
when they think I'm wrong.

01:04.772 --> 01:06.730
Well, I can do that, sir.

01:07.317 --> 01:10.355
I'd tinker with an aspect or two
of your tax plan.

01:10.487 --> 01:13.024
Perhaps tweak your Mid East policy.

01:13.156 --> 01:17.491
I'd also like to take a crack
at reprioritizing your domestic agenda.

01:17.619 --> 01:19.951
Health care, welfare, family leave.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.321
Your budget needs a complete overhaul.

01:22.457 --> 01:27.202
Your slate of judicial nominees is weak.
And your foreign policy, sir... [chuckles]

01:27.337 --> 01:31.376
It's more of an ad hoc lump of shifting
positions than a policy, isn't it?

01:31.508 --> 01:33.090
[both chuckle]

01:33.802 --> 01:37.215
Well, Senator Alexander
wants to move into my office.

01:37.347 --> 01:40.510
Governor Sinclair's
a walking rubber stamp.

01:40.642 --> 01:44.510
And Congressman Sharpe wants to take
a blowtorch to my agenda.

01:44.646 --> 01:47.934
None of the three candidates are perfect.
We'll stipulate to that.

01:48.066 --> 01:49.977
But they all bring something important
to the table.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.522
Experience.
The ability to expand your base.

01:52.654 --> 01:55.396
You're both focused on the politics.
You're missing the point.

01:55.532 --> 01:58.240
The point is we don't need to have
a vice president right now.

01:58.368 --> 02:00.780
The line of succession to the presidency
is already in place.

02:00.912 --> 02:03.074
The Speaker of the House.
The president of the Senate.

02:03.206 --> 02:05.197
Both have been elected to their position.

02:05.334 --> 02:07.075
Both have earned their right to serve,

02:07.210 --> 02:09.292
unlike anyone I can simply appoint.

02:09.420 --> 02:13.335
Agreed. But having a VP serves
another agenda. To help you govern.

02:13.467 --> 02:17.756
Tyler, Fillmore, Johnson...
Andrew, not Lyndon. And Arthur.

02:17.888 --> 02:20.380
All succeeded presidents
who died while they were in office.

02:20.515 --> 02:22.677
Not one of them appointed a VP.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.766
And not one of them
is on American currency.

02:24.895 --> 02:27.262
Except for Johnson.
He was on a commemorative dollar.

02:27.397 --> 02:28.899
And he was impeached.

02:30.525 --> 02:33.142
The first man
that I appointed vice president

02:34.237 --> 02:36.365
was involved in a massive conspiracy

02:36.490 --> 02:39.232
that almost brought our country down
and cost me my life.

02:40.327 --> 02:42.193
We're gonna get this right.

02:42.746 --> 02:44.953
We're gonna wait until we find
the perfect candidate.

02:45.082 --> 02:48.074
Respectfully, Mr. President, we can't.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.034
Vetting's been a slow crawl for months.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.878
The Journal caught wind of it.
They are publishing tomorrow.

02:53.006 --> 02:56.215
You won't get a PR bounce
if you name a VP after a piece like that.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.209
You will look reactive and weak.

02:58.345 --> 03:02.009
Lyor's right. If you're going to do this,
tonight is the night.

03:04.101 --> 03:05.808
Then I suggest you both cast a wider net.

03:05.936 --> 03:08.098
We have a few people on deck.
We'll get 'em in.

03:09.690 --> 03:10.771
Okay, fine.

03:10.899 --> 03:14.187
Where do we stand on the $ 600 billion bond
payment owed to Japan at midnight?

03:14.319 --> 03:15.400
The extension should be pro forma.

03:15.529 --> 03:18.317
We're on our way to the State Department
to get Minister Omono's sign off.

03:18.448 --> 03:20.405
-Let's get that done now.
-Yes, sir.

03:22.452 --> 03:23.908
[indistinct chatter]

03:24.037 --> 03:27.746
The president needs to see Senator Givens
and Secretary Aretsky later tonight.

03:27.874 --> 03:29.285
-I'll set it up.
-Good.

03:30.127 --> 03:33.961
Mr. Boone,
my father's birthday is tonight.

03:34.089 --> 03:36.501
Mm-hmm. I'm not getting him anything.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.920
No, no, I'm saying
that I wanted to see him.

03:39.052 --> 03:42.761
Oh. Yeah. Uh, you can leave early.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.505
-Thank you.
-Just come back after.

03:44.641 --> 03:47.258
-So, midnight?
-Midnight is perfect.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.431
Don't say I never do anything for you.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.846
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

03:51.982 --> 03:55.020
-[Emily] Ready?
-Kids today. They have it so easy.

03:55.152 --> 03:56.392
What?

04:00.949 --> 04:03.361
You invite me to dinner then stand me up.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.359
You act like you're
the busiest guy in the world.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.031
Trey, I am so sorry.

04:07.164 --> 04:09.826
I'll get the kitchen to grill
some rib eyes for us.

04:09.958 --> 04:11.790
Tell me who killed JFK,
all will be forgiven.

04:11.918 --> 04:14.376
You'll have to work your way up to that.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.495
You won't have to catch a late flight.

04:16.630 --> 04:19.043
I'll organize transportation
for the morning.

04:19.176 --> 04:22.919
Uh, I wouldn't worry about that. [sighs]
I'm moving to DC.

04:23.054 --> 04:24.089
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

04:24.222 --> 04:27.305
That's fantastic. You worked
everything out with Braniff Securities?

04:27.434 --> 04:31.348
Yep. They told me not to let the door hit me
in the ass on the way out.

04:32.022 --> 04:32.978
Trey, I'm so sorry.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.814
No, it's okay. I need a change of scenery.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.683
Well, you want to be vice president?

04:37.819 --> 04:40.197
Depends.
Do I actually have to do anything?

04:41.490 --> 04:43.572
So, you want a forbearance?

04:43.700 --> 04:48.160
Yes. A six-month roll-over on $600 billion
of T-bonds that have come due.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.619
I've worked with Lyor.

04:49.748 --> 04:52.706
He knows how strong the friendship
between our two countries is.

04:52.834 --> 04:53.915
[Lyor] Indeed.

04:54.044 --> 04:56.206
He also knows that I speak my mind.

04:56.338 --> 04:58.045
-[both chuckle]
-[Lyor] Oh, yes.

04:58.173 --> 05:01.416
Japan has more than a trillion dollars
invested in your country.

05:01.551 --> 05:03.337
You're seeing an excellent return on that.

05:03.470 --> 05:06.758
Hmm. What we are seeing
is interest payments, not principal.

05:06.890 --> 05:08.881
And we worry we never will.

05:09.017 --> 05:12.305
The United States of America
has never defaulted.

05:12.437 --> 05:16.431
Yet. But your national-debt clock
is never going to reverse.

05:16.566 --> 05:19.649
And Japan is never gonna be
a world power again. So what?

05:19.778 --> 05:21.815
Uh, what Lyor is trying to say--

05:21.947 --> 05:24.905
We are requesting a courtesy from an ally.

05:25.033 --> 05:28.321
An ally who gladly accepts
our unwavering military protection.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.535
Who escaped its fate as a backwater

05:30.664 --> 05:33.326
thanks to the generosity
of our post-war reconstruction.

05:33.458 --> 05:34.619
-Outrageous.
-Who should know better

05:34.751 --> 05:37.789
than to send a guy who spends every
free moment vacationing in our country

05:37.921 --> 05:39.878
to lecture us on our economy.

05:43.218 --> 05:46.927
| think the words you're looking for are
"domo arigato.”

05:49.432 --> 05:50.513
Really?

05:52.018 --> 05:54.726
[Emily] You can't talk to
the Japanese finance minister like that.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.973
[Lyor] You know the most popular
pizza topping in Japan is squid?

05:58.108 --> 05:59.098
[Emily] We've left this late.

05:59.234 --> 06:02.477
If we don't get this extension,
we're gonna default. And you provoke him?

06:02.612 --> 06:04.774
-Squid on pizza is a provocation.
-Lyor.

06:04.906 --> 06:07.489
Relax. Takuzo is an old friend.

06:07.617 --> 06:10.780
We'll get the deferral before midnight.
Along with a bottle

06:10.912 --> 06:12.778
-of premium Hokkaido sake.
-[sighs]

06:12.914 --> 06:15.121
Which is all yours.
| don't touch the stuff.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.742
[Emily] I don't know why
| let you out of your cage.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.960
-[Lyor chuckles]
-Seriously.

06:21.256 --> 06:22.587
Get me the president.

06:22.716 --> 06:23.581
[line disconnects]

06:23.717 --> 06:24.923
My call just dropped.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.008
Elevator's probably blocking the signal.

06:27.137 --> 06:30.004
It's not the signal.
I'm getting a no-service indication.

06:30.140 --> 06:31.972
-[elevator rattles]
-Whoa!

06:33.143 --> 06:34.804
That's mildly disconcerting.

06:37.397 --> 06:38.512
[Emily] Oh!

06:38.648 --> 06:40.980
This a good time
to mention my low blood sugar.

06:41.109 --> 06:42.315
[Emily sighs]

06:44.571 --> 06:45.561
Someone!

06:46.448 --> 06:47.404
Somebody!

06:47.949 --> 06:49.451
[Hannah] Has Damian been any help?

06:49.576 --> 06:51.863
[Chuck] None. He's under lock and key
at the safe house.

06:51.995 --> 06:53.110
The key is Alan Turing.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.987
Alan Turing? Who's that?

06:55.123 --> 06:58.161
Is that a serious question?
He invented the computer, Hannah.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.166
And I care because?

07:00.295 --> 07:02.332
There was a code
embedded in all the hacks.

07:02.464 --> 07:04.956
0-6-2-3-1-9-1-2.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.469
-So I looked at it every which way...
-[typing]

07:07.594 --> 07:09.050
...and one arrangement jumped out.

07:09.179 --> 07:12.092
Turing's birthday. June 23rd, 1912.

07:12.223 --> 07:14.351
What does that have to do with anything?

07:14.476 --> 07:16.763
-I don't know yet.
-[beeping]

07:17.687 --> 07:19.143
Damian's ankle bracelet.

07:20.607 --> 07:21.722
-I lost his signal.
-[Hannah] How?

07:21.858 --> 07:23.895
His transponder
is routed through satellites.

07:24.027 --> 07:26.610
The only way we wouldn't be receiving
a signal...

07:27.322 --> 07:30.030
is if there was a massive power outage
and the towers went out.

07:30.158 --> 07:33.196
We lost him?
I'm going to the safe house.

07:39.668 --> 07:40.783
Thanks.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.164
No, thank you, Omar.

07:44.839 --> 07:48.753
Did you know that when
the Washington Monument was built in 1884,

07:48.885 --> 07:51.297
it was the tallest man-made structure
in the world?

07:51.429 --> 07:53.545
Did you know you could brew beer
out of bananas?

07:54.182 --> 07:56.173
-That is more interesting.
-Yep.

07:58.645 --> 08:01.637
-What was that?
-Must be some kind of power outage.

08:01.773 --> 08:03.889
The generators just kicked in.

08:17.455 --> 08:19.071
Son of a bitch.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.415
Mr. President, lights are down
throughout the capital.

08:22.544 --> 08:25.377
I'll get the mayor, the police chief
and the public service chief on the horn.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.542
Thank you, Mike.
Trey, I'm gonna have to take a--

08:27.674 --> 08:29.881
-Rain check.
-Yeah, I'm sorry.

08:31.052 --> 08:33.259
Hey, do you mind spending time with Penny?

08:33.388 --> 08:35.174
-You got it.
-Thank you.

08:39.727 --> 08:41.092
[Hannah] Chuck, I'm here.

08:50.238 --> 08:52.980
The door's ajar, there's shattered glass
in the parking lot.

08:53.116 --> 08:54.072
I'm going in.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.782
[Chuck] Hannah, wait for backup.

09:03.918 --> 09:06.831
Chuck, we got an agent down.
Get me an ambulance.

09:06.963 --> 09:07.953
Roger that.

09:15.430 --> 09:16.886
[Hannah] Damian's gone.

09:19.100 --> 09:21.137
[theme music playing]

09:30.987 --> 09:34.025
The power grids are down
throughout the metropolitan area.

09:34.157 --> 09:35.647
Looks like a cyber-attack.

09:35.784 --> 09:37.946
There's a signature embedded in this hack

09:38.078 --> 09:40.035
that's similar to the space station
and prison hacks,

09:40.163 --> 09:42.780
but this one's next generation.
We're trying to solve it.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.783
The concern is this could be
the prelude to a larger attack.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.536
It's large enough already.
A pattern's emerging.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.878
Trying to undermine our institutions.
But to what end?

09:51.007 --> 09:53.874
We won't know that
until we know who's behind all this.

09:54.010 --> 09:56.297
We've got our best people on it, Mr. President.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.136
How's the White House fixed for power?

09:58.264 --> 10:00.130
Backup generators are good
for eight hours.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.883
If the blackout drags on,
we'll have to start rationing.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.636
The press pool wants to know
what's going on.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.058
Tell them the lights went out.

10:07.190 --> 10:09.852
-Uh, I think they're asking why, sir.
-So are we.

10:09.984 --> 10:13.898
I'll detail the scope of the power outage
and keep a damper on speculation as to why.

10:14.030 --> 10:16.146
-Mr. President, the mayor's en route.
-Thank you.

10:16.282 --> 10:19.820
-I want to see her as soon as she gets here.
-Yes, sir.

10:21.162 --> 10:23.278
[shouting] Help! Help!

10:24.040 --> 10:26.452
Speaking of help, help me solve this.

10:26.584 --> 10:30.122
Well, we're trapped between floors,
which means no one can hear us.

10:30.255 --> 10:33.418
There's no external power source, which means
we can't get this rig started.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.211
And this contraption's
at least 60 years old,

10:35.343 --> 10:37.835
which means there are no exterior ladders
that could carry us to safety.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.554
So what, precisely,
would you like me to do?

10:40.682 --> 10:45.802
[sighs] Help! Anybody! Please! Help!

10:47.063 --> 10:49.225
-You haven't heard from Emily?
-No.

10:49.357 --> 10:51.689
It's not like her and Lyor
to be out of touch.

10:51.818 --> 10:54.025
They were meeting
with Minister Omono at State.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.236
They probably got caught up in traffic
on the way back.

10:56.364 --> 10:59.447
Traffic lights are down.
Few miles can turn into few hours.

10:59.576 --> 11:01.032
Yeah, and cell phones are down.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.402
So, in Em's absence,
you're acting Chief of Staff.

11:03.538 --> 11:05.905
-Per the president.
-Back in the catbird seat. How's it feel?

11:06.040 --> 11:08.873
Like I want to see your statement
on the blackout ASAP.

11:09.002 --> 11:12.085
-Meet the new boss. Same as the old boss.
-[Aaron chuckles]

11:44.454 --> 11:46.411
-[Sasha] What are you doing?
-Hey, Emily's not, uh...

11:46.539 --> 11:49.122
Oh, Sasha, I was just, uh,
leaving her a note.

11:49.959 --> 11:53.247
-Uh, what is this?
- I don't know.

11:53.379 --> 11:56.838
| do. It's a limited edition copy
of All the President's Men

11:56.966 --> 11:59.298
-signed by Woodward and Bernstein.
-You shouldn't be here.

11:59.427 --> 12:02.089
Emily isn't obsessed with Watergate.
But you know who is? Me.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.804
-Seth.
-Why would she get me this?

12:03.932 --> 12:05.764
We're broken up. Unless...

12:05.892 --> 12:07.428
[gasps]

12:07.560 --> 12:10.473
Oh, my God. Our six-month anniversary.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.729
-It's today, isn't it?
-You have to leave. Now.

12:13.858 --> 12:16.691
She never actually used
the words "broken up.”

12:16.819 --> 12:19.151
She... She said that
she wasn't sure about us.

12:19.280 --> 12:22.147
Not being sure is not the same
as... as being broken up.

12:22.283 --> 12:26.868
It's an expression of uncertainty and
uncertainty doesn't toll anniversaries.

12:26.996 --> 12:29.613
And stay out! [sighs]

12:29.749 --> 12:33.913
Let me get this straight: Damian predicted
our NASA hack. He's on the loose.

12:34.045 --> 12:36.286
We've been waiting on him
to cough up the intel,

12:36.422 --> 12:37.537
and he coincidentally escapes

12:37.674 --> 12:39.506
right before our power grid
was taken down.

12:39.634 --> 12:42.717
Aaron, I get it. He could be
responsible for everything.

12:42.845 --> 12:45.507
-We are tracking him down.
-Tell us what you got, Chuck.

12:45.640 --> 12:48.723
For starters, we think he stole the gun
and the car of the agent he clocked.

12:48.851 --> 12:50.467
[scoffs] He's either desperate
or suicidal.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.265
Normally, I'd be able to track him.
Every FBI car's got a beacon.

12:53.398 --> 12:56.436
But the signal's routed through satellite.
With the cell towers out--

12:56.567 --> 12:59.184
What about traffic cams?
They're solar-powered.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.527
Right. I can still access them.

13:05.034 --> 13:06.024
[typing]

13:07.370 --> 13:10.408
| got something. Last visual
of the stolen car was 15 minutes ago.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.911
An intersection near 2650 Wisconsin.

13:14.043 --> 13:15.625
-[Aaron sighs]
-2650...

13:17.672 --> 13:19.208
It's the Russian Embassy.

13:22.176 --> 13:23.428
[Aaron] Keep on it, Chuck.

13:23.553 --> 13:25.544
[indistinct chatter]

13:28.850 --> 13:29.840
[Mike] Mr. President.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.100
Mayor, thank you for coming.

13:32.228 --> 13:33.684
Thank you so much.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.679
This is my national security advisor,
Aaron Shore.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.397
-Ma'am.
-Thank you.

13:37.525 --> 13:39.892
-What's it like out there?
-Not good, sir.

13:40.028 --> 13:42.520
Our public service commissioner
has no idea what caused the outage.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.737
The cause is not as important
as fixing it.

13:44.866 --> 13:46.573
How are you on essential services?

13:46.701 --> 13:49.944
It's supposed to be 30 degrees tonight.
We're passing out blankets.

13:50.079 --> 13:53.538
We're putting the elderly and the infirm
in the few places with backup power.

13:53.666 --> 13:54.497
What about the unrest?

13:54.625 --> 13:57.868
DC's finest are on the job,
but we are a city already on the edge.

13:58.004 --> 14:00.621
We have a sanitation strike
and a public hiring freeze.

14:00.757 --> 14:03.920
Our unemployment rate
is 50% above the national average.

14:04.052 --> 14:06.510
-What can we do to help?
-Sir, I need a command center.

14:06.637 --> 14:08.423
The power's down in City Hall.

14:08.556 --> 14:11.048
If there is a government building
with electricity you could--

14:11.184 --> 14:13.721
I'll do you one better.
We'll set you up in the White House

14:13.853 --> 14:15.639
-So our people can coordinate.
-[sighs]

14:15.772 --> 14:17.763
We can monitor your progress,
chip in where we can.

14:17.899 --> 14:20.812
We'll set you up in the Truman Room.
Agent Ritter will show you.

14:20.943 --> 14:23.731
-Mr. President, thank you.
-Thank you, Mayor.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.274
Right this way, Mayor.

14:29.243 --> 14:32.235
Yeah? Yes. Thank you.

14:33.289 --> 14:34.324
Kendra, what the hell happened?

14:34.457 --> 14:37.825
The Japanese finance minister
sent this demand letter.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.668
They want the T-bonds paid. No extension.

14:40.797 --> 14:42.162
Do they provide an explanation?

14:42.298 --> 14:45.461
They said the bonds are heavily invested
in our power grids and infrastructure.

14:45.593 --> 14:48.335
Tonight's blackout
didn't exactly inspire confidence.

14:48.471 --> 14:51.304
No. The wire transfers
have to originate from Treasury,

14:51.432 --> 14:53.139
and their computers are down.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.013
[Tom] What the hell...?
That's not supposed to happen.

14:56.145 --> 14:59.308
Unless we want to watch
our national credit rating nosedive,

14:59.440 --> 15:01.602
-we need an alt, and fast.
-A third-party payment.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.645
No, the markets will see that
as a weakness.

15:03.778 --> 15:06.770
We're in a bind. Whether we default
or have a third-party make the payment,

15:06.906 --> 15:10.274
-the Dow will react. And not in a good way.
-Reach out to the SEC chairman.

15:10.410 --> 15:13.869
See if he can hold off the opening bell,
give us some time to try and solve this.

15:13.996 --> 15:15.373
-Yes, sir.
-Thank you.

15:15.498 --> 15:18.160
-I'll reassure congressional leadership.
-Thank you, Aaron.

15:18.668 --> 15:19.624
[cell phone rings]

15:19.752 --> 15:21.208
You have a Valeria sighting yet?

15:21.337 --> 15:24.295
No. I waited outside
the Russian Embassy for two hours,

15:24.424 --> 15:26.916
then walked up to the guard shack
and asked for her.

15:27.051 --> 15:28.633
[smirks] What'd they say?

15:28.761 --> 15:30.798
| think it was Russian for "drop dead."

15:30.930 --> 15:33.137
You may be able to tell that
to Damian in English.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.973
| got a beat on that stolen FBI car.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.887
-Where?
-He was heading north.

15:37.019 --> 15:40.478
The last photo was at a traffic cam
on Garfield and 29th.

15:42.358 --> 15:43.314
Then the photos stop.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.309
| know the area. I'm ten minutes out.

15:48.614 --> 15:51.231
You try talking your way out of this,
you son of a bitch.

16:08.885 --> 16:12.378
Hey, Chuck, I got a visual on his car.
He wrecked it.

16:12.513 --> 16:15.380
Yeah, but I don't have a visual on you.
Be careful.

16:16.934 --> 16:17.969
[gun firing]

16:22.231 --> 16:24.848
-Drop the gun!
-Hannah, let me explain.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.351
Drop the gun or I put one in your head.

16:29.655 --> 16:30.645
Turn around.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.232
On the ground.
Hands behind your back.

16:44.587 --> 16:46.578
So you're a killer now too?

16:46.714 --> 16:47.704
Hannah.

16:52.803 --> 16:54.510
Why does he have my address?

16:55.139 --> 16:56.880
Because he was going to kill you.

16:58.935 --> 17:00.425
And I had to stop him.

17:07.108 --> 17:09.601
[news reader] The citywide blackout
now enters hour two...

17:09.737 --> 17:10.602
-Hey.
-Hey.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.319
| wanted to say good night to Penny.

17:12.448 --> 17:14.064
Oh, she's down for the count.

17:14.909 --> 17:16.023
-Really?
-Yep.

17:16.786 --> 17:18.742
-She ate all her veggies?
-Check.

17:18.871 --> 17:19.952
Finished her homework?

17:20.080 --> 17:21.821
Tom, I did everything on your list.

17:21.958 --> 17:25.121
Fed her, checked her homework,
fired M-80s off the balcony with her...

17:25.252 --> 17:27.915
-Tucked her in with a bottle of tequila.
-[chuckles] Trey...

17:28.047 --> 17:29.629
Fine. I didn't check her homework.

17:29.757 --> 17:31.122
Thank you.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.296
-You okay?
-Aside from a blackout,

17:34.428 --> 17:36.715
the Japanese calling in
a $600 billion bond

17:36.847 --> 17:40.636
and two of my senior staff who seem to
have disappeared into the Bermuda Triangle.

17:40.768 --> 17:41.724
So business as usual?

17:41.852 --> 17:44.640
[chuckles] Yeah, something like that.

17:45.273 --> 17:46.809
Thanks for holding down the fort.

17:47.650 --> 17:50.017
I'll call you when Penny and |
break into Langley.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.187
Don't get caught.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.438
[news reader] ...remain calm,
since the city is doing everything it can

17:54.574 --> 17:56.861
to restore power as quickly as possible.

17:56.993 --> 18:01.032
Police are reporting acts of vandalism
and looting throughout the city.

18:01.664 --> 18:03.200
No sign of restoring power.

18:03.332 --> 18:06.040
Now we're getting reports of sporadic violence
erupting around the city.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.705
-What have you told the press?
-As little as possible.

18:08.838 --> 18:10.954
Good man. Any word from Emily and Lyor?

18:11.090 --> 18:12.205
No, sir.

18:13.175 --> 18:15.007
-You okay?
-Yeah.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.043
Occam's razor.

18:17.179 --> 18:20.843
Simplest explanation is they're hold up
in traffic somewhere, having a laugh.

18:20.975 --> 18:22.136
[chuckles] True.

18:25.271 --> 18:26.978
-[clicks tongue]
-What?

18:27.648 --> 18:31.562
We have no electricity,
SO you're not jerry-rigging anything.

18:31.694 --> 18:35.278
Except your likely electrocution.
If you hold the wrong wire when--

18:35.406 --> 18:38.114
-At least I'm doing something.
-Yes, you are.

18:38.909 --> 18:42.072
You're confusing motion for progress.
As per usual.

18:42.204 --> 18:43.410
Excuse me?

18:43.539 --> 18:45.906
You know, overkill. It's your thing.

18:46.042 --> 18:47.203
You micromanage the staff.

18:47.335 --> 18:49.872
You put out three memos
when one would do just fine.

18:50.004 --> 18:53.588
| believe in rules.
You act like they don't apply to you.

18:53.716 --> 18:56.925
Oh, well, they don't.
Thinkers get special dispensation.

18:57.053 --> 19:00.045
Really? What am I thinking right now?

19:04.226 --> 19:08.811
-That is completely uncalled for.
-Okay, genius. Think our way out of this.

19:08.939 --> 19:12.728
Well, it's been a few hours
and no one's come by yet.

19:12.860 --> 19:15.943
So it could be a zombie apocalypse.

19:16.989 --> 19:20.653
But more likely, it's after hours
and the building is probably empty.

19:28.084 --> 19:31.372
Yep. There's only one thing left to do.

19:32.630 --> 19:37.966
-Help! Help!
-Help! Anybody! Someone!

19:38.094 --> 19:39.084
Shh. Wait.

19:39.929 --> 19:41.385
Help!

19:41.514 --> 19:42.424
Help!

19:42.556 --> 19:46.720
On a cold March night, a blackout has left
hundreds of thousands of DC residents

19:46.852 --> 19:48.263
without heat or power.

19:48.396 --> 19:50.103
Some have taken the law
into their own hands

19:50.231 --> 19:51.721
by looting and setting fires.

19:51.857 --> 19:56.101
As the unrest grows, there are
growing reports of scrimmages with police.

19:58.906 --> 20:00.146
[Tom] Aaron, what do you got?

20:00.282 --> 20:03.240
Garfield Heights, Bellevue,
Shipley Terrace.

20:04.370 --> 20:05.326
Oh, my God.

20:05.454 --> 20:08.116
And dozens hospitalized.
It's like a ticking time bomb.

20:08.791 --> 20:10.077
What do you suggest?

20:10.209 --> 20:12.496
As interim Chief of Staff
or national security advisor?

20:12.628 --> 20:13.789
Both.

20:14.422 --> 20:16.663
As Chief of Staff,
I'd say this is still a local matter.

20:16.799 --> 20:19.257
We should give the mayor time
to get her hands around it,

20:19.385 --> 20:21.251
rather than infringe on her authority.

20:21.387 --> 20:22.923
And as national security advisor?

20:23.639 --> 20:26.722
I'd say we're one incident
away from full-scale riots.

20:26.851 --> 20:29.183
A loss of life.
[sighs]

20:29.311 --> 20:31.803
I'd consider mobilizing
the National Guard, sir.

20:37.820 --> 20:39.436
Come with me.

20:45.202 --> 20:47.239
[indistinct chatter]

20:49.582 --> 20:52.290
Yes, Commissioner. Yes, thank you.

20:52.418 --> 20:54.000
Thank you. Please keep me informed.

20:54.128 --> 20:56.961
-How's it going?
-Rough sledding.

20:57.089 --> 21:00.047
We are distributing aid, but we are dealing
with isolated pockets of violence.

21:00.176 --> 21:01.883
They're more than isolated.

21:02.011 --> 21:05.129
We have a tax base that barely covers
our essential services.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.881
When the government
doesn't fulfill its end of the bargain

21:08.017 --> 21:10.349
by keeping the lights on,
all that frustration boils over.

21:10.478 --> 21:13.641
Which is why |'ve decided
to deploy DC's National Guard

21:13.773 --> 21:15.764
get this under control
before this gets out of hand.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.607
Respectfully, that's a bad idea.

21:17.735 --> 21:21.399
| don't understand. You just said DC Metro's
understaffed and overwhelmed.

21:21.530 --> 21:24.238
Yes, but federalizing this
is not the answer.

21:24.366 --> 21:26.983
You'll alienate the public.
We will get a handle on this.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.406
| just need a little more time. Please.

21:31.874 --> 21:33.535
Our nation's capital is dark.

21:33.667 --> 21:37.251
The world is watching
and Lady Liberty's light has gone out.

21:37.379 --> 21:40.246
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
you've run out of time.

21:45.179 --> 21:47.716
[Aaron] Okay, let's go over this again.

21:48.557 --> 21:49.672
Why'd you escape?

21:49.809 --> 21:54.178
The guy I shot was a contract killer.
His name's Ray Kinney.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.270
You might know his brother, Lou.

21:56.398 --> 21:58.856
Lou is the guy who tried to kill me.

21:58.984 --> 22:02.648
The guy our mysterious hacker hired.
The guy you shot dead.

22:02.780 --> 22:05.613
You've known this all along!
You've been sitting on this information.

22:05.741 --> 22:08.358
-Why wouldn't you say anything?
-[Damian] I'm wearing an ankle bracelet,

22:08.494 --> 22:09.484
under house arrest.

22:09.620 --> 22:12.453
If I told you the assassin's brother
was gunning for you,

22:12.581 --> 22:14.447
it's unlikely you'd have believed me.

22:14.583 --> 22:16.574
-Who turned the lights out?
- I don't know.

22:16.710 --> 22:19.088
Why did you go to the Russian Embassy?

22:20.005 --> 22:21.837
That was personal, not business.

22:21.966 --> 22:23.798
You're going to die in prison, Damian.

22:26.178 --> 22:28.761
| know you don't trust me, Hannah, but think.

22:30.015 --> 22:33.804
| stole a federal vehicle and wrapped it
around a pole in an empty street.

22:33.936 --> 22:36.769
Did it cross your mind
that I wanted you to find me?

22:39.525 --> 22:40.811
Why?

22:40.943 --> 22:44.777
So you'd know I wasn't trying to escape.
| was protecting you.

22:48.909 --> 22:53.949
Okay. Assuming that any of that is true,
how did Ray Kinney get my specs?

22:54.623 --> 22:57.160
| may have an answer.
He dumped his burner phone.

22:57.293 --> 23:00.411
He put in a call to Valeria Poriskova.
She could have hired him.

23:00.546 --> 23:02.708
[Aaron] If Ray Kinney
was working for the Russians,

23:02.840 --> 23:05.502
Lou Kinney must have been
working with them as well.

23:05.634 --> 23:07.921
You're telling us
Russia is responsible for the hack.

23:08.053 --> 23:10.670
-No, Russia isn't.
-That's not how I do the math.

23:10.806 --> 23:13.298
The brothers weren't working the same job.

23:13.434 --> 23:17.849
Lou was hired by our anonymous hacker.
| was a target because of what I know.

23:17.980 --> 23:21.063
Ray wanted payback
for his brother's death.

23:21.191 --> 23:23.683
Valeria hired him to kill
two birds with one stone.

23:23.819 --> 23:25.856
Why would Valeria Poriskova want me dead?

23:25.988 --> 23:27.820
Do you really need to ask that question?

23:29.450 --> 23:32.988
-Why did you go to see her?
-Can't tell you that, Hannah.

23:40.794 --> 23:43.047
-Mr. President?
-What do you got, Mike?

23:43.172 --> 23:47.211
Emily and Lyor were seen leaving the meeting
with Omono around 7:00 p.m.

23:47.343 --> 23:49.835
But their driver said
they never made it back to the car.

23:49.970 --> 23:51.552
That doesn't make sense.

23:51.680 --> 23:54.172
-Where the hell are they?
-Maybe they took the metro.

23:54.308 --> 23:55.924
There's still hundreds of people trapped
underground.

23:56.060 --> 24:00.179
You think two of my senior staff
spontaneously decided to take the subway

24:00.314 --> 24:03.898
-instead of their chauffeur-driven Escalades?
-It's more plausible than alien abduction.

24:04.860 --> 24:07.852
-Keep looking, Mike. I'm starting to worry.
-Yes, sir.

24:08.864 --> 24:10.229
[news reader] The duration, scale...

24:11.116 --> 24:15.781
Half a roll of Mentos,
some allergy medicine and lip balm.

24:15.913 --> 24:17.074
I'll take some of those Mentos.

24:17.206 --> 24:20.449
Oh, my battery's at 14%.
We'll need to use yours soon.

24:20.584 --> 24:22.086
-No can do.
-Why not?

24:22.211 --> 24:23.827
| checked mine with security

24:23.963 --> 24:25.749
so it wouldn't go through
the metal detector.

24:25.881 --> 24:27.792
Radiation degrades the phone's circuitry.

24:27.925 --> 24:30.417
I'm gonna die in a metal coffin
with a lunatic.

24:30.552 --> 24:31.587
[chuckles]

24:31.720 --> 24:34.758
There's nothin' to be afraid of.
You won't even know you're dead.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.472
I'm not ready to check out.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.058
Of course.
You have too much to accomplish.

24:39.186 --> 24:42.395
And you can accomplish much, hmm.

24:45.150 --> 24:47.232
-Hmm.
-What?

24:47.361 --> 24:50.604
You'd have to avoid scandal,
which shouldn't be a problem for you.

24:50.739 --> 24:52.855
-You're fundamentally boring.
-Boring?

24:52.992 --> 24:56.906
It's good. You're uncontroversial.
Plus, educated, well-spoken.

24:57.037 --> 25:00.246
Eh, you'd have to run
for lower office first, obviously.

25:00.374 --> 25:02.285
Congress, a statehouse, you know?

25:02.418 --> 25:05.627
Can you pretend you know how to have
a conversation with a human being?

25:05.754 --> 25:07.461
I'm saying that you could be president.

25:07.589 --> 25:09.921
-[chuckles] That's crazy.
-No, it's not.

25:10.050 --> 25:10.960
[chuckles]

25:11.093 --> 25:12.583
You're the youngest Chief of Staff
in history.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.461
You're the first female one.

25:14.596 --> 25:17.463
You have more policy chops
than anyone except me.

25:17.599 --> 25:19.681
You're mildly awkward,
but in an endearing way

25:19.810 --> 25:22.142
-that will actually draw voters.
-I'm not awkward.

25:22.271 --> 25:23.761
Judgy, though.
That, we'd have to work on.

25:23.897 --> 25:25.934
-You're being ridiculous.
-Judgy.

25:26.066 --> 25:28.524
Lyor, I don't wanna be president.

25:30.237 --> 25:31.318
Why not?

25:31.947 --> 25:34.735
Because I'm just a kid from Akron.

25:36.702 --> 25:38.409
You're a lot of things, Emily.

25:38.537 --> 25:41.279
But "just a kid from Akron"
isn't one of them.

25:54.303 --> 25:55.509
Hey.

25:55.637 --> 25:58.925
Hey. How'd your meeting
with the SEC commissioner go?

25:59.058 --> 26:02.801
Bad. He doesn't wanna politicize his job
by delaying the opening bell.

26:02.936 --> 26:05.143
So blackouts and loan defaults
and rioting.

26:05.272 --> 26:06.307
Oh, my.

26:07.149 --> 26:08.435
What are you doing?

26:08.567 --> 26:11.980
So Em and I...
It's our six-month anniversary.

26:12.112 --> 26:14.069
Oh. I... I thought you two were broken up.

26:14.198 --> 26:16.030
So did I. But I guess we weren't.

26:16.158 --> 26:19.321
But we will be when she figures out
| forgot to get her something,

26:19.453 --> 26:20.488
so I'm, uh... I'm improvising.

26:20.621 --> 26:23.454
-By getting her nutrition bars?
-She loves these.

26:23.582 --> 26:27.041
Cranberry walnut. Banana kale.
Low glycemic. High in protein.

26:27.169 --> 26:28.751
Seth, are you mental?

26:28.879 --> 26:31.792
-Sorry?
-These bars are for people who count calories.

26:31.924 --> 26:34.712
You give them to Emily as a gift,
what's her takeaway?

26:36.345 --> 26:37.255
Oh.

26:37.387 --> 26:39.845
My point is, she just needs to know
you're thinking of her.

26:39.973 --> 26:42.385
Of course I am.
| think about her all the time.

26:42.518 --> 26:45.886
Good. So just get her something
that doesn't make her think

26:46.021 --> 26:48.262
she should make a beeline
for the StairMaster.

26:48.857 --> 26:50.359
Oh.

26:54.029 --> 26:56.441
[news reader] The unrest in Washington
has worsened

26:56.573 --> 26:58.655
as the police have mysteriously vanished,

26:58.784 --> 27:00.900
leaving federal vehicles
to patrol the streets

27:01.036 --> 27:02.822
and an increasingly restive populace.

27:02.955 --> 27:06.914
With DC police absent, there are now
worries of an impending boiling point.

27:07.042 --> 27:08.544
No, she didn't.

27:08.669 --> 27:11.377
You pulled the police back?
On whose authority?

27:12.714 --> 27:13.704
Give us the room, please.

27:20.973 --> 27:24.056
Mine, sir. DC Metro answers to me.

27:24.184 --> 27:26.562
We're solving the same problem.
We should be working together.

27:26.687 --> 27:30.772
Exactly. But you're sending soldiers
into low-income neighborhoods.

27:30.899 --> 27:32.185
| know these people.

27:32.317 --> 27:36.060
Turning the district into a militarized zone
will only inflame them.

27:36.196 --> 27:38.654
They need to know they have
someone in power they can trust.

27:38.782 --> 27:41.444
If that can't be you,
then it has to be me.

27:41.577 --> 27:43.113
| appreciate your insight,

27:43.245 --> 27:46.112
but we both have to deal with
the circumstance that we've been given.

27:46.248 --> 27:49.491
The only way to keep a lid on this
is to invoke martial law.

27:49.626 --> 27:51.208
Your soldiers aren't enough?

27:52.421 --> 27:55.630
You're gonna impose a curfew?
Suspend habeas corpus?

27:55.757 --> 27:59.000
You'll restore order,
but at what cost, sir?

27:59.887 --> 28:02.595
-You'll be a dictator.
-I suggest you watch your tone.

28:02.723 --> 28:03.713
And you better understand

28:03.849 --> 28:07.638
that I will not tolerate the loss of life
or destruction of property in my backyard!

28:07.769 --> 28:09.806
I'm not asking you to, sir.

28:09.938 --> 28:12.316
DC is all about local rule.

28:12.441 --> 28:15.433
| can't be seen
as if I'm colluding with the feds.

28:15.569 --> 28:18.277
If you establish this
us-versus-them mentality,

28:18.405 --> 28:20.112
| will never be able to govern here.

28:20.240 --> 28:22.948
From the looks of it,
you're not governing now.

28:25.454 --> 28:26.785
Pull your people back.

28:30.626 --> 28:32.458
I'll mobilize the entire force.

28:32.961 --> 28:36.170
Off-duty and volunteer officers.
I'll pull in the fire department,

28:36.298 --> 28:39.916
institute strategic road closures.
Give my people one hour.

28:40.052 --> 28:45.843
One hour, Mr. President,
to see if they can put a lid on things.

28:45.974 --> 28:47.089
And if they can't?

28:48.560 --> 28:50.221
Then you lock down our city.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.470
You've got one hour.

29:06.119 --> 29:07.951
-Aaron!
-What is it?

29:08.080 --> 29:09.787
The hack on the power grid.
Turing's birth date.

29:09.915 --> 29:11.781
-Maybe it's call and response.
-What?

29:11.917 --> 29:16.206
Alan Turing's death date.
0-6-0-7-1-9-5-4. If I'm right,

29:16.338 --> 29:18.921
it could unlock a binary polynomial
in the power grid's OS,

29:19.049 --> 29:22.292
allowing us to extract the polluted code
that shut it down.

29:22.427 --> 29:24.919
Reboot the system. Restore the status quo.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.008
-Try that.
-[cell phone beeps]

29:29.268 --> 29:32.181
This is Chuck Russink. Get me
the electric company's chief engineer.

29:36.692 --> 29:38.808
-[lwoman] Mr. President.
-Thank you.

29:39.528 --> 29:42.566
Mr. President, I'm sorry I'm so late.
The traffic lights were out.

29:42.698 --> 29:47.283
| understand. Thank you for getting here
on such short notice. Please.

29:50.622 --> 29:52.033
| have to be honest.

29:52.165 --> 29:55.829
I'm a little confused by your country's
reluctance to extend the due date

29:55.961 --> 29:58.544
for your T-bonds.
Of course, that's your choice.

29:58.672 --> 30:01.664
But given the circumstances
in the district tonight,

30:01.800 --> 30:07.386
| was hoping, without offending you,
if I could make a personal plea?

30:08.223 --> 30:12.057
There's no need, Mr. President.
Your brother already persuaded me.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.726
[stammers] My brother?

30:14.855 --> 30:17.438
Yes. I've known Trey for a long time.

30:17.566 --> 30:21.025
His company did a public offering
on the Nikkei a few years ago,

30:21.153 --> 30:22.564
when I was a regulator.

30:22.696 --> 30:26.655
| trust him. So when he reached out to me,
he made a good point.

30:26.783 --> 30:27.944
Which was?

30:28.076 --> 30:32.070
That by extending the bonds,
my country wasn't betting on your economy.

30:32.205 --> 30:33.707
It was betting on you.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.118
| see.

30:35.250 --> 30:38.709
Trey said Tom Kirkman is someone
who has faced long odds

30:38.837 --> 30:40.453
and come through every time.

30:41.506 --> 30:45.591
Someone whose word is his bond.

30:47.763 --> 30:49.094
And we agree.

30:49.222 --> 30:51.259
Minister Omono, I am honored.

30:52.392 --> 30:53.382
Thank you.

30:54.770 --> 30:57.262
-Mr. President.
-Let me show you out.

31:02.194 --> 31:03.184
[Omono] Sir.

31:04.071 --> 31:07.280
Sir, the mayor needs you.

31:07.407 --> 31:08.522
Okay.

31:10.911 --> 31:12.902
[news reader] These videos were taken
a few minutes ago,

31:13.038 --> 31:15.655
showing a widespread chaos
in the nation's capital

31:15.791 --> 31:18.453
with the district police nowhere to be seen.

31:25.801 --> 31:27.337
We failed, sir.

31:27.469 --> 31:29.710
-So calm has not been restored?
-No, sir.

31:29.846 --> 31:33.134
The police are doing what they can,
but looting is spreading and I fear riots.

31:33.266 --> 31:34.973
Mayor, you did the best you could.

31:35.102 --> 31:37.639
Unfortunately,
| don't see an alternative to martial law.

31:37.771 --> 31:40.138
Yes, but it's an indictment of the city.

31:41.817 --> 31:43.603
Of the residents.

31:44.152 --> 31:45.734
And if we don't rebuild trust,

31:45.862 --> 31:48.650
| don't think my community
will soon recover.

31:49.449 --> 31:51.656
I'm sorry, you just said "my community."”

31:52.786 --> 31:55.995
-You actually live in Bellevue?
-Yes, sir, I do.

31:56.123 --> 31:58.160
So it really is your community.

31:59.668 --> 32:03.286
Perhaps that's all we need to do.
Remind people of that.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.254
That it's their community.

32:05.882 --> 32:08.715
-Sir?
-Mike, could you protect the mayor and me?

32:08.844 --> 32:09.800
Sir, if you intend--

32:09.928 --> 32:13.717
| understand your concerns,
but I need your honest evaluation.

32:13.849 --> 32:16.056
We'd need to send out advance teams,

32:16.184 --> 32:18.346
vet the locations,
but we could sanitize things.

32:18.478 --> 32:19.593
Thank you.

32:20.689 --> 32:24.523
Mayor, you up for some
old-fashioned retail politics?

32:25.527 --> 32:28.360
[chuckles] Lead on, Mr. President.

32:28.947 --> 32:29.937
Good.

32:32.033 --> 32:35.526
[Tom] This shelter will be providing
water, blankets and baby food.

32:35.662 --> 32:38.745
[mayor] It will be restocked
until the power's been restored.

32:38.874 --> 32:40.581
[man] Get the damn lights back on!

32:40.709 --> 32:43.041
| promise you, sir, we're workin' on it.

32:44.212 --> 32:48.206
There are 680,000 people in this district.

32:49.885 --> 32:53.378
Do you know what I told the president
about each one of them?

32:53.513 --> 32:56.881
That there's no city in the country
whose residents are more proud.

32:57.017 --> 32:58.849
And do you know what he told me?

32:58.977 --> 33:01.514
[Tom] As a city, we're simply neighbors.

33:01.646 --> 33:04.855
Neighbors who support each other,
pull for each other.

33:04.983 --> 33:07.270
No one knows this more than Mayor Darby,

33:07.402 --> 33:11.737
because she doesn't just represent
this community, she's a member of it.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.778
-She lives here.
-[crowd applauds and cheers]

33:14.910 --> 33:17.618
[Darby] And as long as
you have each other's backs,

33:17.746 --> 33:20.363
the president and |
can promise you one thing.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.115
We'll have yours.

33:22.250 --> 33:23.331
[crowd cheering]

33:23.460 --> 33:27.374
[Tom] And that's not just politics
as usual, it's common sense.

33:27.506 --> 33:30.965
We all need each other to work together
to make our home better.

33:31.092 --> 33:34.710
And this is our home.
I'm not leaving and neither is she.

33:36.973 --> 33:38.884
[Darby] So we'll make you a deal.

33:39.017 --> 33:41.429
We'll roll up our sleeves if you will.

33:45.273 --> 33:47.105
-Can I have another Mento?
-No.

33:49.528 --> 33:51.269
[sighs] Fine.

33:52.531 --> 33:54.738
Oh, just the African violet ones, please.

33:55.283 --> 33:56.739
You mean purple?

33:56.868 --> 33:58.029
No, African violet.

33:58.161 --> 34:00.869
Oh. Why are you such a pain in the ass
about everything?

34:00.997 --> 34:02.829
-You mean precise?
-I mean annoying.

34:02.958 --> 34:04.619
[chuckles softly]

34:08.922 --> 34:11.789
When I was ten,
| did a project on Ancient Greece.

34:12.926 --> 34:14.507
| researched it for months.

34:14.636 --> 34:17.003
| learned conversational Greek, actually.

34:17.138 --> 34:21.302
And my work culminated
in a scale model of the Acropolis,

34:21.434 --> 34:23.516
right down to the number
of steps on the Parthenon.

34:23.645 --> 34:24.554
Wow.

34:24.688 --> 34:25.723
Yeah.

34:26.982 --> 34:28.313
And I showed my dad.

34:29.400 --> 34:32.018
He was this famous antiquities scholar.

34:32.152 --> 34:35.235
And he spent hours silently examining it.

34:35.824 --> 34:37.313
And you know what he said?

34:37.449 --> 34:39.157
"My kid's a freaking genius"?

34:39.286 --> 34:43.871
That I had confused the ionic architecture
of the columns with the Doric style,

34:43.998 --> 34:48.333
thus rendering my project
"a largely inaccurate facsimile.”

34:54.926 --> 34:55.960
I'm sorry.

34:56.928 --> 35:00.216
Don't be. That was the nicest thing
he ever said to me.

35:00.348 --> 35:02.430
It's his idea of a compliment.

35:03.268 --> 35:04.133
[chuckles]

35:04.269 --> 35:08.308
That his ten-year-old son was only guilty
of being largely inaccurate.

35:08.440 --> 35:09.976
[breathes deeply]

35:10.108 --> 35:14.022
So when I ask you for that color Mento,
it's not purple...

35:15.780 --> 35:18.522
or amaranth or magenta.

35:22.537 --> 35:23.948
It's African violet.

35:32.505 --> 35:36.715
One African violet Mento
for my good friend Lyor.

35:43.558 --> 35:45.219
Not after you've touched it.

35:47.062 --> 35:48.302
Oh, thank God!

35:50.273 --> 35:51.513
[crowd cheering]

35:51.650 --> 35:52.515
[cheers]

35:54.694 --> 35:55.980
Congratulations, Mayor!

35:56.112 --> 35:58.228
Thank you, Mr. President! Thank you!

35:58.365 --> 35:59.275
Great job!

35:59.407 --> 36:00.863
We got our lights!

36:03.745 --> 36:06.328
[Kendra] They did it. They won them back.

36:07.832 --> 36:11.450
You believe that this is actually working?

36:11.586 --> 36:12.576
Yep.

36:13.922 --> 36:14.912
Most def.

36:16.675 --> 36:18.006
Yeah. Me too.

36:19.761 --> 36:20.751
Me too.

36:30.355 --> 36:31.766
Good morning.

36:31.898 --> 36:34.890
The blackout that affected our city
is now over,

36:35.026 --> 36:39.771
thanks to the incredible cooperation
between local and federal governments.

36:39.906 --> 36:42.694
Now I have to say,
through last night's experience,

36:42.826 --> 36:46.740
| think I've learned how to add
a little light to my administration.

36:46.871 --> 36:50.455
We are all too well aware of the tragic
and treasonous circumstances

36:50.583 --> 36:53.075
that surrounded Vice President MacLeish.

36:53.211 --> 36:57.580
Those circumstances left me uncertain
about how to fill that role.

36:57.716 --> 37:00.799
| wanted someone with clarity of thought
and a sense of purpose.

37:00.927 --> 37:04.465
Someone who would speak their mind
and challenge me to become a better leader.

37:05.140 --> 37:07.177
Someone who understood there is a time

37:07.308 --> 37:11.643
when principled opposition
needs to give way for the greater good.

37:12.564 --> 37:13.599
And to be honest,

37:14.482 --> 37:17.065
| did not think
| would find that candidate.

37:17.986 --> 37:19.226
But I was wrong.

37:20.405 --> 37:24.023
So it is with great pleasure and pride
that I introduce to you

37:24.159 --> 37:28.198
my nominee for vice president
of the United States of America,

37:28.329 --> 37:29.660
Mayor Ellenor Darby.

37:32.500 --> 37:33.490
[both speak inaudibly]

37:36.254 --> 37:38.040
A bad day with a good ending.

37:38.173 --> 37:39.288
Yep.

37:50.143 --> 37:53.010
Hey, uh, speaking of good ending,

37:53.146 --> 37:55.979
-1, uh... I got you something.
-What?

37:56.107 --> 37:59.190
| know you thought
that I forgot our anniversary,

38:00.236 --> 38:01.692
but, um, I didn't.

38:01.821 --> 38:02.856
Um...

38:09.370 --> 38:10.826
Tickets to Bon lver.

38:11.706 --> 38:12.662
Carmen.

38:12.791 --> 38:13.997
The menu from Minibar.

38:14.125 --> 38:16.537
These are things we missed
because of work.

38:16.669 --> 38:18.410
Except I didn't miss 'em.

38:18.546 --> 38:21.254
| heard every song with you,
shared every dish.

38:48.576 --> 38:51.068
[laughs] Really?

38:51.204 --> 38:52.239
Really.

38:59.587 --> 39:03.251
Mr. Speaker, I'm glad you share
our enthusiasm for Mayor Darby.

39:04.008 --> 39:05.749
Thank you. Okay. Goodbye.

39:05.885 --> 39:07.296
Sir, I have your brother.

39:07.428 --> 39:08.930
Please send him in.

39:10.431 --> 39:11.421
You look like hell.

39:11.558 --> 39:13.720
You should see what I look like
after a busy day.

39:13.852 --> 39:17.140
The good news is when this gig's done,
you'll be highly employable.

39:18.022 --> 39:19.183
Trey, you lied to me.

39:19.315 --> 39:21.773
Fine. Somewhat employable.

39:21.901 --> 39:24.279
| know you weren't fired. You quit.

39:24.404 --> 39:27.567
| talked to the managing director
of Braniff Securities.

39:28.616 --> 39:29.947
| wanted to be here.

39:31.077 --> 39:34.115
With you and the kids.
If I said I was quitting to move down here--

39:34.247 --> 39:35.988
I'd have talked you out of it.

39:36.124 --> 39:38.456
Exactly. 'Cause you're my big brother.

39:39.377 --> 39:40.538
Here's the thing.

39:41.045 --> 39:43.833
It can't be just you
looking out for me anymore.

39:43.965 --> 39:45.080
| wanna pitch in.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.427
You already have.

39:47.552 --> 39:50.260
Thank you for what you said
to the Japanese minister.

39:52.432 --> 39:56.721
[chuckles softly] I'm sorry.
I'm not used to you lookin' out for me.

39:56.853 --> 40:00.517
| know. But think of it this way.
The door swings both ways.

40:01.482 --> 40:04.474
| babysit Penny,
you bail me out of a Turkish prison.

40:04.611 --> 40:05.942
[laughs]

40:06.070 --> 40:08.323
That would be an abuse of this office.

40:09.449 --> 40:10.359
Thai prison?

40:10.491 --> 40:12.107
[Tom laughs]

40:12.243 --> 40:13.233
Let's eat.

40:30.637 --> 40:32.298
| don't like being summoned.

40:33.056 --> 40:34.797
Then I'll keep it brief.

40:34.933 --> 40:36.890
| know you tried to have me killed.

40:37.018 --> 40:40.852
And I know Damian came to see you.
And I will find out why.

40:42.941 --> 40:44.181
It was about you.

40:45.610 --> 40:47.351
He asked me not to kill you.

40:50.782 --> 40:52.864
But I don't listen to Damian.

40:54.869 --> 40:56.485
No. But you should listen to me.

40:56.621 --> 40:59.989
If you ever try to take me out again,
you better not miss.

41:01.501 --> 41:02.707
Because I won't.
