on the Presidential Commission
for Space Exploration.

10:29.013 --> 10:31.848
That's not a plant.
He's my son, Charlie.

10:31.883 --> 10:34.784
My dad should be
in the Smithsonian.

10:34.819 --> 10:36.953
Basically started working
for NASA when he was ten.

10:36.988 --> 10:39.990
I saw the Apollo 15 space
launch at Cape Canaveral.

10:40.024 --> 10:41.292
Really?

10:41.326 --> 10:43.126
Yes, my folks drove down
from Charlottesville

10:43.161 --> 10:45.996
in our Ford Country Squire
station wagon.

10:46.030 --> 10:47.430
What's your favorite
mission, Charlie?

10:47.465 --> 10:48.465
Pioneer Ten.

10:48.499 --> 10:49.766
Back from the dead

10:49.800 --> 10:51.835
and 7 billion miles away.

10:51.869 --> 10:52.902
And still going.

10:52.937 --> 10:53.904
See ya, Earth.

10:53.938 --> 10:55.639
I'm with Carl Sagan on that.

10:55.673 --> 10:57.408
We're just a pale-blue dot.

10:57.442 --> 10:59.310
Excuse me.

10:59.344 --> 11:01.980
I oversee all multimedia
projects at the Smithsonian,

11:02.014 --> 11:03.315
and the first I've heard
of this film

11:03.349 --> 11:05.684
is a phone call I got
about 15 minutes ago.

11:05.718 --> 11:07.519
Who exactly signed off
on your project?

11:07.553 --> 11:10.155
Dennis Stephens.

11:10.189 --> 11:12.857
I have no idea
who that is.

11:12.892 --> 11:14.025
I'm calling--

11:14.060 --> 11:15.927
The Board of Directors,
he's on it.

11:15.962 --> 11:17.562
He's in charge of fundraising
for the next two years,

11:17.596 --> 11:19.531
including the Heritage Fund.

11:19.565 --> 11:21.366
- You familiar with that?
- Yes, I am.

11:21.400 --> 11:22.601
Sorry to interrupt.

11:22.635 --> 11:25.137
No, it's no problem.

11:26.839 --> 11:35.413
Sorry.

11:35.447 --> 11:37.281
The irony of a view
you can't enjoy

11:37.315 --> 11:38.983
is not lost on me.

11:39.017 --> 11:40.884
I didn't want to give you
a different office

11:40.918 --> 11:42.452
just 'cause you can't
appreciate blue skies.

11:42.487 --> 11:45.121
By the way, we replicated your
D.P.D. workstation to the inch.

11:45.155 --> 11:47.156
Not exactly.

11:47.191 --> 11:49.058
You added
state-of-the-art speakers

11:49.092 --> 11:50.793
and some other goodies.

11:50.827 --> 11:52.628
Catered lunch at 1:00 p.m.

11:52.662 --> 11:56.432
You're in
the big leagues now.

12:06.443 --> 12:09.246
Wow, you've really
made this place your own.

12:09.280 --> 12:10.914
And so quickly.

12:10.948 --> 12:12.616
Annie,
I had to sift through

12:12.651 --> 12:14.685
a lot of your NASA
interview footage.

12:14.719 --> 12:16.653
Next time try to
put the control question

12:16.688 --> 12:19.590
in the same place
during each interview.

12:19.624 --> 12:21.925
You varied it once.
Duly noted.

12:21.960 --> 12:24.695
In 84% of perjury cases,

12:24.729 --> 12:26.998
the subjects display
common physical behaviors,

12:27.032 --> 12:28.900
and in 70%
of those cases,

12:28.934 --> 12:30.568
they actually try
to hide themselves.

12:30.603 --> 12:33.438
They put up a physical
barrier like an arm.

12:33.472 --> 12:36.174
What are you working
on specifically right now?

12:36.208 --> 12:41.144
I, um, I supervise
a team of technicians

12:41.179 --> 12:43.580
in the satellite
maintenance office.

12:43.614 --> 12:44.748
That's it?

12:44.782 --> 12:46.249
That's our start.

12:46.283 --> 12:48.251
The arm across
his waist is the tell,

12:48.285 --> 12:51.621
so we dug deeper.

12:51.655 --> 12:54.457
The tensile quality
in his oculi and oris muscles

12:54.492 --> 12:57.027
is inconsistent
during this answer.

12:57.061 --> 12:59.196
An involuntary
sign of deceit.

12:59.231 --> 13:00.431
Or he was just nervous.

13:00.465 --> 13:01.666
He's got motive.

13:01.700 --> 13:03.201
NASA refused
to fund his project

13:03.235 --> 13:04.803
on satellite refueling
six months ago.

13:04.837 --> 13:06.538
His wife left him last year.

13:06.572 --> 13:08.540
And while he was initially
admitted to NASA

13:08.575 --> 13:10.142
through
the astronaut program,

13:10.176 --> 13:11.777
he never got
to go up in space.

13:11.811 --> 13:13.312
Of all the guys
I interviewed there,

13:13.347 --> 13:16.615
will was the only one cut
from genuine NASA cloth.

13:16.650 --> 13:19.618
NASA engineers are poorly
paid and underappreciated,

13:19.652 --> 13:22.487
two qualities that fit
the treasonous profile.

13:22.522 --> 13:24.022
We need to get him
under surveillance.

13:24.056 --> 13:26.024
That's N.S.A. purview.

13:26.058 --> 13:29.126
We'll get Joan to liaise
with Fort Meade.

13:29.160 --> 13:30.127
No.

13:30.161 --> 13:31.762
No way.
Absolutely not.

13:31.796 --> 13:33.964
A wiretap means
we're in bed with N.S.A.

13:33.998 --> 13:35.532
And they would control
the legacy switch.

13:35.566 --> 13:38.369
Sorry.

13:38.403 --> 13:40.871
Uh, an R1 wire transmitter

13:40.906 --> 13:42.540
could get around
the legacy switch.

13:42.574 --> 13:44.142
Supersede
the rule of law?

13:44.176 --> 13:46.411
Destroy our tenuous relationship
with justice and the N.S.A.?

13:46.446 --> 13:47.813
If you'll let me
just finish--

13:47.847 --> 13:49.314
No.

13:49.349 --> 13:51.016
Reva, you're new,

13:51.051 --> 13:52.518
so I'll let you in
on the way things work

13:52.552 --> 13:54.019
in my division.

13:54.054 --> 13:55.888
There is no socratic
method here.

13:55.922 --> 13:57.689
My decisions are final.

14:08.666 --> 14:09.866
You okay?

14:09.901 --> 14:13.169
Um, I'm fine.
I just have allergies.

14:13.204 --> 14:16.038

are at 8.5.

you're not the first person

14:17.708 --> 14:19.575

14:19.610 --> 14:20.676
Really?

14:20.711 --> 14:22.678
She's actually kind of cool.

14:22.713 --> 14:26.582
Well, maybe not cool,
but not so bad

14:26.617 --> 14:28.551
once you figure her out.

14:28.585 --> 14:31.020
In D.S.T. we didn't have
to figure out people.

14:31.055 --> 14:35.558
We just generated files
and charts and studies and--

14:37.094 --> 14:39.429
I transferred here
to the D.P.D.

14:39.464 --> 14:41.465
because I wanted
more of a challenge.

14:41.499 --> 14:44.535
And clearly
I've gotten it.

14:44.569 --> 14:47.571
Around here, it's a bit more
of a two-way street,

14:47.605 --> 14:49.940
human intelligence
and hard facts.

14:49.974 --> 14:53.977
Yeah.

14:54.011 --> 14:55.978
What about
one-way surveillance?

14:56.013 --> 14:57.380
Bug their home?

14:57.414 --> 14:58.648
Why not?
We could do it ourselves.

14:58.683 --> 15:00.316
We'd only hear
one side of the phone call.

15:00.351 --> 15:01.451
But we'd hear everything

15:01.485 --> 15:02.853
that was going on
in their house.

15:02.887 --> 15:04.755
We'd maintain jurisdiction
over the investigation,

15:04.789 --> 15:06.357
and we wouldn't have
to interface with N.S.A.

15:06.391 --> 15:07.491
That'll work.

15:07.526 --> 15:10.594
How should we get
inside their house?

15:10.629 --> 15:12.831
Create a diversion?
Call in a bomb threat?

15:12.865 --> 15:14.499
No, that's likely
to tip off the FBI,

15:14.534 --> 15:15.500
and we don't want that.

15:15.535 --> 15:18.404
How 'bout this?

drop off a photo we have here

15:35.522 --> 15:38.791
as a small thank you
for doing our piece.

15:38.825 --> 15:40.293
- Today?
- Yeah, today'd be great.

you guys out for a bite.

15:55.175 --> 15:56.676
Annie, when you were
up at NASA,

15:56.710 --> 15:58.444
did anything seem
out of the ordinary?

15:58.478 --> 16:02.015
Uh, P.R. rep asked me
what I was doing,

16:02.049 --> 16:03.183
but I handled it.

16:03.217 --> 16:05.719
You handled it?

16:05.753 --> 16:07.020
Did it ever occur to you

16:07.054 --> 16:10.056
that you might have blown
your cover yesterday?

16:10.090 --> 16:11.958
I mean, what are the chances
of them having a barbecue

16:11.992 --> 16:14.828

yourself over?

to declassify these three
Afghanistan missions?
