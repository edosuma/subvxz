00:07.250 --> 00:10.483
- Previously on Hawaii Five-O...
- There are things you must know

00:10.508 --> 00:11.809
about Kenji Higashi.

00:11.834 --> 00:13.353
He killed Masuda-San.

00:13.378 --> 00:15.012
- He is not to be trusted.
- Daddy?

00:17.758 --> 00:18.816
Where's Haru?

00:18.841 --> 00:20.409
I put him on a plane.

00:20.434 --> 00:22.234
He's taking care of
something for me in Japan.

00:22.259 --> 00:23.292
And what about Endo?

00:23.317 --> 00:24.664
He in Japan, too?

00:24.689 --> 00:26.100
If you're feeling the pressure of living

00:26.125 --> 00:27.392
this double life of yours,

00:27.417 --> 00:28.601
let me know.

00:28.626 --> 00:30.960
I'd be more than happy to
put you on a plane, too.

00:38.138 --> 00:40.138
_

00:41.195 --> 00:42.629
Don't.

00:44.351 --> 00:45.618
Don't. Just don't.

00:45.643 --> 00:47.978
- Don't what?
- Last time I was ironing a shirt,

00:48.003 --> 00:50.237
you came in here, you
said a bunch of dumb stuff,

00:50.262 --> 00:52.835
and it turned into a big
thing... I just, I-I like ironing.

00:52.860 --> 00:54.361
I just want to iron in peace.

00:54.386 --> 00:56.711
- I'm not gonna say anything.
- Good.

00:56.736 --> 00:57.903
I will say

00:57.928 --> 01:00.000
that, in my opinion, you should invest

01:00.025 --> 01:03.603
in a nice cotton blend,
wrinkle-free, so...

01:04.461 --> 01:06.382
- Let me ask you a question.
- Okay.

01:06.407 --> 01:08.675
Is it boring being as
predictable as you are?

01:08.700 --> 01:10.734
You know, last time we
got into a thing because

01:10.759 --> 01:12.403
you were going on a date and
you didn't tell me about it.

01:12.428 --> 01:13.747
So may... so maybe this time

01:13.772 --> 01:15.858
you'll be forthcoming and
tell me what's going on.

01:15.883 --> 01:18.018
I'm going on a date with Emma.

01:18.043 --> 01:19.043
- Emma?
- Emma.

01:19.077 --> 01:20.277
The cute, uh...

01:20.302 --> 01:21.602
- The gorgeous...
- The gorgeous

01:21.627 --> 01:23.561
- veterinarian. Ah.
- That's right.

01:23.715 --> 01:24.992
Last week you had a date with Brooke,

01:25.016 --> 01:27.320
- this week you have a date with Emma?
- You don't approve?

01:27.345 --> 01:29.129
I don't believe you.
I think you're just,

01:29.154 --> 01:31.207
you're, uh, you're messing
with me a little bit.

01:31.232 --> 01:33.304
Alexa, what's my schedule tonight?

01:33.329 --> 01:35.928
At 8:00 p.m., there's
dinner at Maile's Thai Bistro

01:35.953 --> 01:38.638
- with Emma Okino.
- Huh. Thank you.

01:38.706 --> 01:39.906
Oh, Alexa?

01:39.931 --> 01:41.165
Is Danny Williams an idiot?

01:41.190 --> 01:42.724
I'm not going to answer that.

01:42.834 --> 01:44.879
See? She's loyal to me
'cause I bought her for you.

01:44.903 --> 01:45.980
No, she just doesn't know you yet.

01:46.020 --> 01:47.087
- No?
- Give her time.

01:47.138 --> 01:48.439
Okay.

01:48.506 --> 01:50.040
Yo.

01:50.108 --> 01:52.053
Hey, bud. Can you leave the
iron on when you're done?

01:52.077 --> 01:54.178
- Yeah, you got it.
- What, you got a date, too?

01:54.245 --> 01:55.412
- Huh?
- Aha.

01:55.437 --> 01:59.407
Let me guess, uh, salty
brunette, cute smile,

01:59.432 --> 02:01.428
got a thing for mermaids, loudmouth?

02:01.453 --> 02:04.074
Hey. She likes to say she's
always using her outside voice.

02:04.389 --> 02:05.599
Well, you know what? I think it's great

02:05.623 --> 02:07.465
that you and Tani are
giving it a go, bud.

02:07.490 --> 02:09.121
Yeah, me, too.

02:10.613 --> 02:11.761
McGarrett.

02:12.834 --> 02:14.855
Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait. What?

02:16.441 --> 02:17.641
Shots fired, Adam's building.

02:17.702 --> 02:18.836
Grover's en route.

02:42.918 --> 02:46.269
Adam. Hey. You all right?

02:46.297 --> 02:48.031
Yeah. Kenji sent them.

02:48.722 --> 02:50.376
Okay, all right. Let's
get you cleaned up.

02:50.401 --> 02:52.379
Come on, we got to get you out
of here, get you someplace safe.

02:52.403 --> 02:53.737
Come on. No... Lou, Lou.

02:53.762 --> 02:56.519
What we need to do right now
is take down Kenji and his crew.

02:57.294 --> 02:59.329
- Right now.
- What are you talking about?

03:01.349 --> 03:03.189
I've been trying to
dismantle Kenji's operation

03:03.214 --> 03:04.676
for months now,

03:05.059 --> 03:07.566
and I finally have
the evidence to do it.

03:11.041 --> 03:16.041

04:09.633 --> 04:11.167
Five-O! Drop your weapons!

05:55.992 --> 05:57.531
Go ahead.

05:58.721 --> 05:59.988
Finish it.

06:00.530 --> 06:02.272
I want to hear you say it.

06:03.453 --> 06:04.397
Masuda.

06:07.398 --> 06:09.125
Yes.

06:10.401 --> 06:12.367
I killed Masuda.

06:12.982 --> 06:14.916
And you and your girlfriend
would have been next

06:14.941 --> 06:16.742
had Tokyo not intervened.

06:27.640 --> 06:30.609
I need EMTs behind the house right now.

06:31.258 --> 06:33.383
You know, you were
right not to trust me.

06:33.868 --> 06:37.507
I was working for Five-O
the whole time, playing you.

06:38.465 --> 06:40.111
And now I have video footage

06:40.136 --> 06:43.305
of you and your crew
executing Endo and Haru.

06:45.023 --> 06:46.679
You're going away, Kenji,

06:47.133 --> 06:48.739
and never getting out.

06:49.430 --> 06:51.367
Well done, Noshimuri.

06:52.950 --> 06:56.054
Except I don't see how
you can let me live.

06:57.210 --> 06:59.061
Why, because you'll talk?

06:59.444 --> 07:00.711
Yes.

07:01.828 --> 07:04.444
And I have a lot to say about you.

07:06.460 --> 07:08.499
I'll take my chances.

07:11.944 --> 07:13.591
_

07:40.827 --> 07:42.538
- I'm so sorry for your loss.
- Thank you. Are you okay?

07:42.912 --> 07:47.525
- Hi. Sorry I'm late.
- Well, you're here now.

07:47.569 --> 07:50.498
Councilman Mikala, this
is our daughter Noelani.

07:50.523 --> 07:51.867
Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you, Noelani.

07:52.593 --> 07:54.393
I'm so sorry it's under
these circumstances.

07:55.296 --> 07:57.229
Your uncle was a great man.

07:57.254 --> 07:58.606
The number of kids that Pastor Akumu

07:58.631 --> 08:01.335
pulled out of gangs, helped get clean...

08:01.360 --> 08:03.515
His passing is a huge
loss for the community.

08:03.796 --> 08:06.319
But I'm gonna make sure his
church has the funding it needs

08:06.344 --> 08:07.878
to continue his good work.

08:09.534 --> 08:11.635
We appreciate your generosity.

08:12.608 --> 08:14.379
I understand you're a physician.

08:14.404 --> 08:15.671
Your parents must be proud.

08:15.929 --> 08:17.416
I am actually

08:17.441 --> 08:19.835
the chief medical examiner
of Honolulu County.

08:20.055 --> 08:21.822
Very impressive.

08:24.241 --> 08:25.667
Forgive my parents, Councilman.

08:25.692 --> 08:28.140
They think it's a little weird
that I work with dead bodies.

08:29.663 --> 08:31.952
Well, if you'll excuse me.

08:32.844 --> 08:34.381
Of course. Nice meeting you.

08:37.839 --> 08:39.498
I'm gonna go pay my respects.

09:17.682 --> 09:19.134
_

09:19.159 --> 09:20.596
Let me get this straight.

09:20.621 --> 09:23.424
Your plan to take down the
Yakuza was to fly to Japan

09:23.449 --> 09:25.565
and have them make you an oyabun?

09:26.152 --> 09:27.526
- Yes.
- Uh-huh.

09:27.551 --> 09:30.022
And as oyabun, I would
have been able to dismantle

09:30.047 --> 09:32.376
the entire operation from within.

09:32.401 --> 09:33.735
And to prove your loyalty,

09:33.760 --> 09:35.727
you decided to become
an inside man for them

09:35.752 --> 09:37.128
and start feeding them HPD...

09:37.153 --> 09:38.754
I was giving them morsels, Steve.

09:39.132 --> 09:40.708
Just enough to keep them on the hook

09:40.733 --> 09:43.802
while I gathered the evidence
I needed, and it worked.

09:43.827 --> 09:46.362
Look, the fact that you
thought this plan of yours

09:46.387 --> 09:48.121
was the best way to do it,

09:48.146 --> 09:49.190
that's not the problem here.

09:49.215 --> 09:50.549
You weren't straight with me.

09:50.574 --> 09:52.352
All right? You lied to me.
You lied to me multiple times.

09:52.377 --> 09:54.306
I gave you so many
chances to come clean.

09:54.331 --> 09:55.523
You know as well as I do

09:55.548 --> 09:58.542
you would have said it was too
dangerous, shut everything down.

09:59.565 --> 10:03.690
But after what Kenji did,
what he put Tamiko through,

10:03.920 --> 10:07.526
I did what I had to do, okay?
I had to see this through.

10:07.551 --> 10:09.995
Did you? 'Cause that
wasn't your call to make.

10:10.020 --> 10:11.946
You didn't just put yourself at risk.

10:11.971 --> 10:14.347
You risked the reputation
of this entire unit.

10:14.493 --> 10:16.110
Don't you see that?
And that right there,

10:16.135 --> 10:18.214
that's... hey... that's
something I have to answer for.

10:20.191 --> 10:22.534
Look, if you want my
badge, I'll understand.

10:23.688 --> 10:25.233
If I want your badge,
I'll take your badge.

10:25.258 --> 10:27.926
All right? Right now what I
want is for you to go down to HPD

10:27.951 --> 10:29.367
and debrief the
organized crime division.

10:29.392 --> 10:31.626
You're gonna tell 'em
everything you know.

10:31.651 --> 10:34.810
Of course.

10:35.883 --> 10:39.221
McGarrett. Wait, what?

10:40.601 --> 10:42.969
Yeah. Oh, I got it. We're on the way.

10:43.572 --> 10:45.306
Everything okay?

10:48.943 --> 10:51.768
A freighter two miles off the
coast of Oahu was attacked.

10:51.793 --> 10:53.839
Crew were taken hostage,
captain shot dead.

10:53.864 --> 10:56.143
Shouldn't the Coast Guard be on that?

10:56.168 --> 10:58.307
According to the crew, it was
the Coast Guard who attacked.

11:01.285 --> 11:03.319
We just thought it was
just a routine check.

11:03.823 --> 11:06.753
They had Coast Guard uniforms, badges.

11:06.793 --> 11:08.371
And their skiff was, it was skinned.

11:08.396 --> 11:10.531
You know, to make it
look like the real deal.

11:10.556 --> 11:11.757
We let them on board,

11:11.782 --> 11:13.827
and before you know it, they
had guns out and they were

11:13.893 --> 11:15.961
- ordering us on the ground.
- They're pirates.

11:15.986 --> 11:18.823
It's just a unique way to hijack a ship.

11:18.848 --> 11:20.743
I've been working these
shipping lanes for years, and

11:20.767 --> 11:22.567
I-I'd never even heard
of an attack like this.

11:22.592 --> 11:24.570
Well, there must have been
something about this boat

11:24.595 --> 11:25.462
that was too good to pass up.

11:25.614 --> 11:26.881
Yeah. Eh, uh,

11:26.906 --> 11:28.473
what kind of cargo do you have on board?

11:28.498 --> 11:30.138
You know, I can give
you the manifest, but

11:30.163 --> 11:32.086
it didn't even seem
like they made it down

11:32.111 --> 11:34.123
to the cargo hold. I mean,
as soon as they were on board,

11:34.148 --> 11:36.582
they locked the entire
crew in the cabin and...

11:37.179 --> 11:40.151
uh, they ordered the captain
to take 'em down to the safe.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.085
That's where it happened.

11:43.801 --> 11:45.417
You want to take us down there?

11:45.442 --> 11:46.676
Please.

11:53.558 --> 11:55.465
Well, looks like our captain
got off a couple shots

11:55.490 --> 11:56.591
before he was killed, huh?

11:56.616 --> 11:58.217
He kept a gun in the safe.

11:58.491 --> 12:00.058
When they forced him to open it,

12:00.083 --> 12:02.018
he must have grabbed
it and fired at 'em.

12:02.043 --> 12:03.577
Uh, what else was in the safe?

12:03.903 --> 12:07.339
Just money. Payroll, petty cash.

12:07.364 --> 12:08.698
Do you know how much cash?

12:08.831 --> 12:10.971
Uh, 20 to 50 grand,

12:10.996 --> 12:13.096
depending on how deep
we were into the route.

12:13.292 --> 12:15.962
Look, man, we're all, uh,
we're all sorry for your loss,

12:15.987 --> 12:17.948
and we appreciate you
going through this with us.

12:17.973 --> 12:19.175
Thank you.

12:19.200 --> 12:22.253
All right. So, why would
anybody go to that much trouble

12:22.427 --> 12:23.956
for less than 50 grand?
Doesn't make sense to me.

12:23.981 --> 12:25.659
Yeah, especially when
these shipping freighters

12:25.684 --> 12:27.819
carry millions in cargo.

12:27.844 --> 12:29.690
Maybe they were just getting
started with the safe.

12:29.715 --> 12:33.026
Yeah, you're right. It could be that
they were moving on to the cargo

12:33.051 --> 12:35.174
when the captain started
firing and they bailed.

12:35.199 --> 12:36.266
I-I just feel like

12:36.291 --> 12:37.601
there's something we're not seeing here.

12:39.698 --> 12:40.995
Excuse me.

12:42.472 --> 12:43.957
Hey. Noelani.

12:43.982 --> 12:45.593
We're really sorry to
hear about your uncle.

12:45.618 --> 12:49.120
Oh, thank you. Um, that's
actually why I'm calling.

12:49.145 --> 12:50.889
Look, there's something going on here,

12:50.914 --> 12:52.253
- and I could use your help.
- Okay.

12:52.278 --> 12:55.089
My family was told that my
uncle died of a heart attack.

12:55.114 --> 12:56.495
But at his wake today,

12:56.520 --> 12:58.154
I noticed an acute rash on his arm

12:58.179 --> 13:00.180
that isn't consistent
with a cardiac event.

13:00.205 --> 13:02.139
Well, how did the coroner's
report explain that?

13:02.164 --> 13:03.231
See, that's the thing.

13:03.423 --> 13:05.057
The rash isn't even mentioned.

13:05.082 --> 13:06.314
I reached out to the coroner,

13:06.339 --> 13:07.772
but he refused to discuss it.

13:07.840 --> 13:09.949
I was hoping for some sort
of professional courtesy,

13:09.974 --> 13:11.541
but he pretty much just blew me off.

13:11.566 --> 13:12.677
You think he's hiding something?

13:12.864 --> 13:15.731
I'm not sure. But, Steve...

13:16.626 --> 13:19.551
before my uncle became a pastor,
he was involved with gangs

13:19.576 --> 13:21.543
and suffered from a
substance abuse problem.

13:21.568 --> 13:24.036
I hate to think that
he got into some sort

13:24.061 --> 13:25.928
of trouble or had a relapse, but...

13:26.175 --> 13:28.988
even if that's the case, I
just want to know the truth.

13:29.004 --> 13:30.324
Noelani, here's what I'm gonna do.

13:30.349 --> 13:32.716
I'm gonna send Quinn down
there to help you out with this.

13:32.741 --> 13:33.851
Whatever's going on, we're gonna get

13:33.875 --> 13:34.875
to the bottom of it.

13:34.943 --> 13:37.845
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah, of course.

13:39.770 --> 13:41.051
- Hey, boss.
- Yo.

13:41.076 --> 13:42.510
Something you got to see here.

13:46.068 --> 13:47.569
Fresh blood.

13:49.434 --> 13:51.702
We know the captain fired his weapon.

13:51.727 --> 13:53.345
But what if he hit one of these pirates,

13:53.370 --> 13:56.239
and that guy's crew left him for dead?

13:56.504 --> 13:58.083
If it was me, I'd probably hide.

13:58.108 --> 14:00.043
He might still be on the ship.

14:00.068 --> 14:02.488
Yeah, we got to
split up into search parties.

14:03.051 --> 14:05.272
If this guy's still on the
ship, we got to find him.

14:05.297 --> 14:06.723
Copy that.

14:17.282 --> 14:19.504
- Clear.
- Moving.

14:26.428 --> 14:27.920
- Clear.
- Move.

14:27.945 --> 14:29.279
Moving.

14:43.145 --> 14:44.426
Clear.

14:45.790 --> 14:49.226
Hey... sorry we had to cancel our date.

14:49.660 --> 14:53.090
Now? Really, Joons, you
have to work on your timing.

14:53.637 --> 14:54.698
Fair enough.

14:54.723 --> 14:57.106
To be fair, I was kind
of looking forward to it.

14:57.850 --> 14:59.293
Me, too.

15:18.130 --> 15:20.064
Tani! Tani!

15:23.170 --> 15:25.404
Boss! Boss!

15:25.429 --> 15:28.331
McGarrett!

15:58.074 --> 15:59.996
Tani, she's stuck inside!

16:00.021 --> 16:02.268
- Okay. On three, on three, here we go.
- Yeah.

16:02.293 --> 16:05.361
One! Two! Three!

16:06.605 --> 16:09.035
Tani!

16:16.862 --> 16:19.410
- Found him.
- Yeah, you don't say.

16:26.312 --> 16:27.999
Subject is an 87-year-old

16:28.024 --> 16:30.218
male,
no visible signs of trauma,

16:30.243 --> 16:32.999
- no drugs present in the tox screen.
- _

16:35.020 --> 16:37.388
You again?

16:37.499 --> 16:39.033
How the hell did you get in here?

16:39.663 --> 16:41.926
- It's amazing the doors this opens.
- This is outrageous.

16:41.994 --> 16:44.529
- I'm in the middle of a report.
- Yeah, I can see that.

16:44.597 --> 16:46.141
Are you gonna base this
one off of evidence,

16:46.165 --> 16:48.109
or are you just gonna make it
up, like you did my uncle's?

16:48.133 --> 16:49.934
You have a sterling reputation,

16:50.045 --> 16:52.413
lots of commendations from
the Medical Examiners Board,

16:52.438 --> 16:55.259
and yet somehow you failed
to notice an obvious rash

16:55.284 --> 16:56.584
on Mr. Cunha's body.

16:57.116 --> 16:59.744
Or at least neglected
to put it on the report.

16:59.769 --> 17:01.937
Dr. Hidoko, I don't
believe a medical examiner

17:01.969 --> 17:04.483
with your experience would
miss something like that.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.809
I just want to know what
happened to my uncle.

17:06.834 --> 17:08.468
You know what else this allows me to do?

17:09.255 --> 17:10.622
Arrest you.

17:12.032 --> 17:15.669
Okay. I did see the rash.

17:15.694 --> 17:16.938
Then why leave it off the report?

17:16.962 --> 17:20.099
The morning I conducted my
exam on Mr. Cunha's body,

17:20.698 --> 17:22.242
someone approached
me in the parking lot.

17:22.268 --> 17:24.202
He said my report should conclude

17:24.227 --> 17:26.530
Mr. Cunha died of a heart attack or...

17:27.288 --> 17:29.116
something very bad would happen to me.

17:30.185 --> 17:32.943
I considered going to the police,
but I was too scared.

17:32.968 --> 17:34.630
The only reason why
someone would want to

17:34.655 --> 17:37.448
change the COD on a coroner's
report is to cover up a crime.

17:37.473 --> 17:39.827
The rash on his arm;
am I correct in thinking

17:39.852 --> 17:41.505
it indicates carbon monoxide poisoning?

17:41.530 --> 17:43.464
In my professional opinion, yes.

17:43.718 --> 17:45.423
Okay, well, the presence
of carbon monoxide

17:45.491 --> 17:47.058
doesn't necessarily indicate foul play.

17:47.169 --> 17:49.036
Sure. But then why cover it up?

17:49.874 --> 17:52.105
We're gonna need a description
of the man who threatened you,

17:52.130 --> 17:54.341
as well as any security footage
you have of the parking lot.

17:54.616 --> 17:56.884
Yeah, of course.

17:59.181 --> 18:01.115
Well, ahoy there, sea dogs.

18:01.335 --> 18:04.094
Anybody left pining for
a life on the high seas?

18:04.119 --> 18:06.120
No, no, it was salty, I was nauseous.

18:06.145 --> 18:08.146
I'm good on land for
the rest of my life.

18:08.171 --> 18:10.473
He really puts the "drama" in Dramamine.

18:10.498 --> 18:12.832
Yeah, Lou, uh, you got something, huh?

18:12.857 --> 18:15.829
I do. Because, even in
the middle of nowhere,

18:15.854 --> 18:17.188
somebody's always watching.

18:17.299 --> 18:19.300
- Mm-hmm.
- So, I learned today

18:19.325 --> 18:21.483
that shipping companies

18:21.796 --> 18:25.096
use satellite technology
in order to combat piracy.

18:25.121 --> 18:26.888
And lucky for us...

18:27.042 --> 18:29.877
caught a look at our
freighter during the attack.

18:29.902 --> 18:31.130
And did that satellite capture

18:31.155 --> 18:32.483
where the pirates went after the raid?

18:32.508 --> 18:34.369
Unfortunately not,
because it only

18:34.394 --> 18:36.296
captures images
in the shipping lane.

18:36.321 --> 18:38.288
But here's something you can see.

18:39.545 --> 18:42.147
There's Calico Jack and two mateys

18:42.381 --> 18:44.983
loading a crate of what
looks like the ship's cargo

18:45.008 --> 18:46.108
onto their skiff.

18:46.133 --> 18:47.901
"What looks like"?
What else would it be?

18:48.382 --> 18:50.864
I don't know. But I'll
tell you what I do know:

18:50.889 --> 18:53.791
HPD just finished going
through the ship's inventory.

18:53.816 --> 18:55.150
Everything's accounted for.

18:55.175 --> 18:57.938
Okay, so something else was
smuggled onto that freighter

18:57.963 --> 18:59.731
with the ship's legitimate cargo.

18:59.756 --> 19:01.141
All right, so taking
the cash from the safe,

19:01.166 --> 19:02.500
that was just a cover.

19:02.525 --> 19:04.545
It was to distract from what
they were really there for.

19:04.570 --> 19:06.247
Right, but to know
something was being smuggled

19:06.271 --> 19:08.183
onto that ship, they would've
had to have an inside man.

19:08.214 --> 19:11.349
Right? Either somebody inside
the smuggling operation...

19:11.374 --> 19:13.008
- Somebody on the crew.
- Right.

19:13.112 --> 19:14.456
Well, the freighter's being

19:14.480 --> 19:16.133
escorted into port as we speak,

19:16.158 --> 19:18.092
and the entire crew are
being brought in by HPD

19:18.117 --> 19:19.050
to take their statements.

19:19.118 --> 19:20.495
All right, what about the dead pirate?

19:20.519 --> 19:21.686
We ID that guy yet?

19:21.769 --> 19:23.036
Yes, sir.

19:23.088 --> 19:25.223
Ran him through facial rec. Here he is.

19:25.248 --> 19:26.767
Kyle Munoz.

19:26.792 --> 19:28.644
Okay, let's dig into Mr. Munoz.

19:28.669 --> 19:31.071
See if you can find a connection
to anybody on the crew.

19:31.096 --> 19:32.939
We should also look
into the, uh, the boat

19:32.964 --> 19:34.608
that the pirates used.
We got anything there?

19:34.633 --> 19:37.921
Yeah. The crew describes it
as a 25-foot Defender-class

19:37.946 --> 19:39.980
speedboat, skinned to
look like law enforcement.

19:40.005 --> 19:41.650
All right, Tani, why
don't you and Junior look into

19:41.674 --> 19:44.108
any boats on the island
that fit that description.

19:44.133 --> 19:45.486
I'm talking registrations,

19:45.511 --> 19:47.211
reports of theft, the works.

19:47.236 --> 19:49.738
We find that boat, we find our pirates.

19:52.342 --> 19:53.794
The man who threatened Dr. Hidoko

19:53.819 --> 19:55.887
is Eke Mahoe.

19:55.953 --> 19:57.798
Looks like he just got out
of prison three months ago

19:57.823 --> 20:00.091
and is living at a halfway
house five miles from here.

20:00.197 --> 20:01.639
What was he serving time for?

20:03.288 --> 20:05.088
Well, you're not gonna believe this:

20:05.113 --> 20:07.882
Mahoe was serving a ten-year
sentence for attempted murder.

20:08.133 --> 20:09.534
He tried to kill your uncle.

20:09.601 --> 20:11.302
So, wait... sorry.

20:11.327 --> 20:14.467
Eke shoots my uncle a decade ago.

20:14.492 --> 20:16.126
Now he's out of prison.

20:16.151 --> 20:17.545
My Uncle Akumu suddenly dies,

20:17.570 --> 20:20.443
and Eke is threatening
a medical examiner

20:20.468 --> 20:22.359
to falsify an autopsy report?

20:22.686 --> 20:24.854
We just found ourselves a suspect.

20:28.835 --> 20:30.741
Back in the day, both Akumu and I

20:30.766 --> 20:32.632
ran with bad crews.

20:33.268 --> 20:36.601
When someone from a rival gang
stepped to you, you retaliated.

20:36.765 --> 20:37.971
It was that simple.

20:37.996 --> 20:41.110
- You thought of them as the enemy.
- _

20:41.135 --> 20:43.470
Which is why I was solely shocked

20:44.132 --> 20:46.764
when the first letter I got in
the joint was from your uncle...

20:47.515 --> 20:49.093
saying he forgave me.

20:49.984 --> 20:52.786
That he turned his life around
and that I could do the same.

20:52.854 --> 20:54.722
That sounds like my Uncle Akumu. Yeah.

20:54.747 --> 20:57.052
We wrote a lot after that.

20:57.880 --> 20:59.927
He gave me hope that I
could be a better man.

20:59.952 --> 21:01.986
And you know what?

21:02.011 --> 21:03.599
By the time I got out...

21:04.419 --> 21:05.699
I was.

21:05.766 --> 21:08.168
Mr. Mahoe, why would you threaten

21:08.193 --> 21:11.129
the coroner unless he ruled
Akumu's death a heart attack?

21:12.075 --> 21:14.932
The day Akumu died, he'd
invited me over for a visit.

21:15.693 --> 21:18.336
When he didn't answer the
front door, I went around back.

21:18.739 --> 21:20.681
I could hear a car
running in the garage.

21:21.216 --> 21:22.750
Carbon monoxide.

21:23.646 --> 21:25.819
I found him in the driver's seat.

21:25.844 --> 21:28.212
He'd run a hose from the
tailpipe to the window.

21:28.544 --> 21:30.457
So you cleaned up the evidence

21:30.880 --> 21:33.863
and insisted the M.E. declare
the COD a heart attack.

21:33.888 --> 21:36.389
That man gave all those kids hope.

21:37.766 --> 21:39.868
Hope that things could get better.

21:42.185 --> 21:43.570
How would they feel if they found out

21:43.595 --> 21:45.029
he took his own life?

21:45.638 --> 21:49.233
I wasn't gonna
let suicide be your uncle's legacy.

21:49.413 --> 21:50.903
I understand.

21:51.334 --> 21:53.781
Um, would you excuse us for a second?

21:54.047 --> 21:55.435
Of course.

22:01.662 --> 22:05.559
This doesn't add up, okay?
No matter how hard it got,

22:05.584 --> 22:06.961
my uncle would never abandon those kids.

22:06.985 --> 22:08.052
They were his life.

22:08.162 --> 22:09.596
Why don't we go to Akumu's house

22:09.621 --> 22:11.823
and check it out ourselves? Sound good?

22:12.639 --> 22:14.040
Yeah.

22:16.794 --> 22:18.729
Hey, big man, how we
doing finding that boat?

22:18.797 --> 22:22.066
Uh, not yet, but I did find us a link.

22:22.177 --> 22:25.464
- Uh-huh.
- Between our dead pirate Kyle Munoz

22:25.489 --> 22:27.090
and a member of the freighter crew.

22:27.115 --> 22:28.193
Hang on.

22:28.482 --> 22:29.650
You remember this guy

22:29.675 --> 22:30.942
- Carl Lawson?
- Yeah.

22:31.232 --> 22:34.019
Well, I found out he grew
up right here on the island.

22:34.044 --> 22:36.056
As a matter of fact, he went

22:36.081 --> 22:38.497
to high school with
our Long John Pilfer.

22:38.960 --> 22:41.295
Phone records confirm,
guys were in touch as...

22:41.320 --> 22:42.808
recently as last week.

22:42.833 --> 22:44.889
All right, so this has
got to be our inside guy.

22:44.914 --> 22:46.681
And you can take that to the bank.

22:46.835 --> 22:49.761
He certainly did... Check this out.

22:49.786 --> 22:54.411
This guy has been receiving wire
transfers from overseas accounts

22:54.880 --> 22:57.738
at regular intervals
for the last three years.

22:57.763 --> 22:59.980
Let me guess, each one
of those transfers matches

23:00.005 --> 23:01.739
up with a freighter trip from China.

23:01.764 --> 23:02.997
That's correct.

23:03.022 --> 23:04.084
So, what's he do?

23:04.109 --> 23:05.709
He calls his boy from
high school, right?

23:05.744 --> 23:07.584
They put a crew together
to pull off the heist.

23:07.613 --> 23:09.290
Right, then he goes and
tells his smuggler friends

23:09.314 --> 23:11.716
that the boat was hit by
a random pirate attack.

23:11.741 --> 23:12.893
We need to talk to Lawson.

23:12.918 --> 23:14.285
Have HPD bring him straight here.

23:14.310 --> 23:15.510
Will do.

23:18.061 --> 23:19.533
Hey, um...

23:19.558 --> 23:22.226
You have, uh, you have
any idea how long this

23:22.251 --> 23:24.052
is gonna take, yeah?
Man, I've been stuck

23:24.077 --> 23:25.622
on that ship for, like,
the last three weeks...

23:48.000 --> 23:50.647
Well, judging by the way
that Lawson is literally kicking

23:50.672 --> 23:52.780
and screaming, I'm guessing
this wasn't a rescue attempt.

23:52.805 --> 23:54.239
Those guys in the masks?

23:54.264 --> 23:56.484
Those aren't his friends...
Those are the smugglers

23:56.509 --> 23:58.543
he was working for, and
now they got questions.

23:58.568 --> 24:00.988
So, they need Lawson back to
figure out where their stuff is.

24:01.013 --> 24:02.714
Whatever they were
smuggling, it had to be

24:02.739 --> 24:04.840
pretty valuable for
them to risk a brazen

24:04.865 --> 24:06.594
daylight assault like this.

24:06.619 --> 24:08.872
Not to pile on, but we
haven't had much luck finding

24:08.897 --> 24:11.499
the boat that the pirates
used. We have HPD pulling

24:11.524 --> 24:13.825
the registrations for
every vessel in that class

24:13.850 --> 24:17.226
on the island, but there's a lot
and it's gonna take some time.

24:17.251 --> 24:19.074
Because now that they have
Lawson, it won't be long

24:19.098 --> 24:22.534
before these smugglers and
their cargo are happily reunited.

24:22.559 --> 24:24.070
All right, forget the boat,
then... why don't we go

24:24.095 --> 24:25.963
after the people that
gave it a makeover?

24:25.988 --> 24:27.558
I like that, that's good.
It takes a special skill set

24:27.583 --> 24:31.018
to skin a boat and make it
look like a Coast Guard skiff.

24:31.043 --> 24:32.610
I'll make some inquiries.

24:32.635 --> 24:33.979
I'll see who provides that
kind of service on the island.

24:34.004 --> 24:35.138
Sounds good.

24:41.347 --> 24:43.347
_

24:44.123 --> 24:45.623
Let's start in the garage.

24:45.648 --> 24:47.115
You guys know what we're looking for.

24:47.140 --> 24:49.508
All right.

24:50.453 --> 24:53.264
- You okay?
- Yeah.

24:53.375 --> 24:56.043
Um, it's just been a while
since I was here last.

24:56.111 --> 24:58.837
Hmm, take your time.
We've got this covered.

24:58.942 --> 25:00.523
Thanks.

25:44.962 --> 25:46.596
Noelani?

25:47.648 --> 25:49.582
Hey.

25:50.848 --> 25:53.300
- You okay?
- Uh, yeah.

25:53.650 --> 25:55.051
Did you guys find anything?

25:55.076 --> 25:58.321
Yeah, the garden hose Eke said
was leading from the tailpipe

25:58.346 --> 25:59.580
to the window.

25:59.605 --> 26:01.172
CSU is running it for prints now.

26:03.712 --> 26:06.751
Do you want to talk about it?

26:10.117 --> 26:11.618
I don't know.

26:13.858 --> 26:16.593
You know, my parents already
disapprove of my career.

26:17.720 --> 26:19.376
How are they gonna react

26:19.401 --> 26:20.641
if my looking into this reveals

26:20.669 --> 26:22.032
that my uncle committed suicide?

26:25.603 --> 26:27.050
When I was in high school,

26:27.075 --> 26:28.790
my brother Brian took his own life.

26:31.647 --> 26:33.481
Um, Quinn, I'm...

26:33.590 --> 26:35.806
I'm so sorry. I, I had no idea.

26:35.831 --> 26:38.199
After he died, my family,
we never talked about it.

26:38.755 --> 26:41.095
Like... at all.

26:41.748 --> 26:44.681
- And it just made things worse.
- I can't imagine.

26:45.482 --> 26:48.243
My brother's life was so much
more than the way he died.

26:48.723 --> 26:50.991
And the same thing goes for your uncle.

26:52.557 --> 26:54.191
So, no matter what we find...

26:55.296 --> 26:57.094
you remember that, okay?

26:59.799 --> 27:01.079
Okay.

27:01.190 --> 27:03.925
Okay. Thanks.

27:12.721 --> 27:14.421
_

27:14.633 --> 27:15.633
Hi.

27:15.658 --> 27:18.219
I truly didn't expect
to see you again so soon.

27:18.244 --> 27:20.311
Hey, so, uh...

27:21.438 --> 27:24.125
it's just you, or are we
waiting on anybody else?

27:24.150 --> 27:25.918
Really sorry to
disappoint you, lover boy,

27:25.943 --> 27:27.410
but Quinn will not be joining us.

27:27.435 --> 27:29.403
I'm not disappointed. It's
very lovely to see you.

27:29.428 --> 27:31.128
I... it's just last time we hung out

27:31.153 --> 27:32.672
we were playing darts,

27:32.697 --> 27:34.107
and the loser was
supposed to buy dinner.

27:34.132 --> 27:36.055
Yeah, I heard you, uh, couldn't
hit the side of the barn.

27:36.134 --> 27:37.976
For the record, I threw that game.

27:38.001 --> 27:39.302
And I'm still waiting to hear

27:39.327 --> 27:41.786
- back from her about our date.
- Hang in there.

27:42.391 --> 27:43.750
So you think I have a chance?

27:43.774 --> 27:45.110
- I do.
- Okay.

27:45.135 --> 27:47.568
All right, so I'm doing
you a little favor here,

27:47.593 --> 27:49.797
and in exchange you can, uh,

27:49.822 --> 27:51.189
put in a good word for me?

27:51.214 --> 27:52.906
I'll put in a good word for you.

27:52.931 --> 27:55.032
Great. Anything specific?

27:55.057 --> 27:57.016
Uh, well, um...

27:57.041 --> 27:58.108
I'm loyal.

27:58.397 --> 27:59.831
Hmm, she can get a dog for that.

27:59.856 --> 28:01.375
All right, you're
enjoying this, aren't you?

28:01.400 --> 28:03.328
- Very much.
- Uh-huh.

28:03.367 --> 28:05.384
Oh, hey, this is Oz, listen,

28:05.409 --> 28:07.988
remember, we don't know
each other. Okay?

28:08.146 --> 28:09.380
Oz!

28:09.572 --> 28:11.340
- Good to see you, brother.
- Hey!

28:11.365 --> 28:13.789
Hey, this is the young lady
I was telling you about.

28:13.814 --> 28:15.446
She's having herself a bit of a, um...

28:15.682 --> 28:18.207
- nautical dilemma.
- Well...

28:18.232 --> 28:19.933
you are in luck, lady.

28:19.958 --> 28:22.093
Because if it floats...

28:22.118 --> 28:23.219
I'm the guy.

28:23.244 --> 28:24.561
Relax, Bubba Gump, we get it.

28:24.586 --> 28:26.101
So, here's the situation I'm in.

28:26.126 --> 28:27.993
Um, I've been dating this guy.

28:28.018 --> 28:29.952
He's a bit of a boat nut.

28:29.977 --> 28:31.978
And, uh, sadly,

28:32.003 --> 28:34.204
things aren't exactly
working out for us.

28:34.485 --> 28:36.745
In that case, maybe I can be of service

28:36.770 --> 28:38.437
in more ways than one.

28:38.462 --> 28:40.625
Focus, Oz. Before I
break it off with him,

28:40.650 --> 28:42.250
I would like to

28:42.675 --> 28:45.703
secure myself a little...
severance package.

28:46.212 --> 28:48.280
He's got a 40-foot catamaran.

28:48.305 --> 28:50.740
He always said we'd sail
off into the sunset together.

28:50.765 --> 28:52.742
And, he's not wrong, he just, uh...

28:52.767 --> 28:54.168
he won't be joining us?

28:54.319 --> 28:55.787
Hey, Oz, listen.

28:55.812 --> 28:57.724
This-this catamaran thing,
you think you can maybe

28:57.790 --> 28:59.791
skin it, maybe change the hull number?

28:59.816 --> 29:01.183
I can do all that.

29:01.294 --> 29:03.996
And for the low, low price of...

29:04.021 --> 29:05.500
ten grand.

29:07.974 --> 29:10.041
Anything else I can help you with?

29:12.504 --> 29:13.705
Actually, yeah.

29:13.730 --> 29:15.174
Why don't you go ahead
and slap those on for me?

29:15.199 --> 29:16.392
You're under arrest.

29:16.781 --> 29:19.869
- She's-she's a cop?!
- Uh, you are a cop?

29:19.936 --> 29:21.170
- That's right.
- This is...

29:21.195 --> 29:22.505
And unless you want to go to jail, too,

29:22.530 --> 29:24.031
with this guy, I'd run along.

29:24.056 --> 29:26.127
I don't want to go to jail.

29:26.152 --> 29:27.152
Sorry, brother.

29:27.177 --> 29:28.377
- Wait.
- Sorry.

29:28.402 --> 29:29.969
Here's the good news, Oz.

29:29.994 --> 29:31.957
I need some information

29:31.982 --> 29:33.539
about a client of yours.

29:33.564 --> 29:35.828
Someone who may have
asked you to skin a boat

29:35.852 --> 29:38.639
and make it look like the Coast
Guard search-and-rescue vessel.

29:38.664 --> 29:39.931
Yeah...

29:39.956 --> 29:42.758
sorry, I just, I-I can't recall

29:42.783 --> 29:44.636
a job of that description.

29:44.661 --> 29:46.195
That's really too bad... Maybe a trip

29:46.220 --> 29:48.054
to a holding cell will jog your memory.

29:48.079 --> 29:50.380
Okay, now that I think
about it, yeah, you know, um,

29:50.405 --> 29:53.006
there was a job like that last week.

29:53.031 --> 29:54.732
Well, what do you know?

29:55.492 --> 29:57.449
I'm gonna need the name of the client.

29:57.560 --> 30:00.796
You're looking for a
guy named Michael Garcia.

30:04.414 --> 30:06.067
Wait a minute, so there's only

30:06.092 --> 30:07.626
one set of prints on that hose,

30:07.651 --> 30:09.719
- and they belong to Eke Mahoe?
- That's correct.

30:09.744 --> 30:11.956
I'm gonna need you to process
the house next, top to bottom.

30:11.981 --> 30:13.430
You got it.

30:14.891 --> 30:16.659
So, it makes sense that Eke's prints

30:16.684 --> 30:18.161
would be on the hose;
he admitted to moving it

30:18.186 --> 30:19.328
when he covered up the crime.

30:19.353 --> 30:21.797
Yeah, but how could my uncle
use that hose to commit suicide

30:21.822 --> 30:23.099
without getting his prints on it?

30:23.124 --> 30:24.835
Not to mention all the other
times he must have used it.

30:25.406 --> 30:26.678
Someone wiped down

30:26.703 --> 30:28.625
that hose before Eke
found your uncle's body.

30:28.657 --> 30:30.646
The only reason to do that is to get rid

30:30.671 --> 30:33.813
of incriminating evidence...
Proof that someone killed him

30:33.838 --> 30:35.439
and then staged his suicide.

30:36.235 --> 30:37.956
Someone murdered my uncle.

30:37.981 --> 30:39.582
It's looking that way, yeah.

30:40.617 --> 30:43.563
Noelani, can you think of anyone
who would want to do that to him?

30:43.781 --> 30:47.066
No, but between his past and
all the work that he's been doing,

30:47.098 --> 30:49.914
Uncle Akumu has crossed paths
with a lot of dangerous people.

30:49.939 --> 30:51.359
And I doubt the gangs
were happy about him

30:51.384 --> 30:52.953
taking their members off the streets.

30:52.978 --> 30:55.212
Yeah, I'm sure they weren't, but
he's been doing this for years.

30:55.664 --> 30:57.075
Why go after him now?

30:57.100 --> 30:58.911
We need to take a deep
dive into your uncle's life.

30:58.936 --> 31:01.246
- Sergeant Liu.
- Run his phone.

31:01.271 --> 31:03.491
Get a list of the
kids he was counseling.

31:03.516 --> 31:05.684
If something happened recently
that made him a target,

31:05.802 --> 31:08.604
chances are, one of those
kids would know about it.

31:10.390 --> 31:12.357
I got nothing to say to you guys.

31:12.382 --> 31:13.946
You're not in trouble, Lewis.

31:13.971 --> 31:15.728
We're here because phone
records show that you were

31:15.752 --> 31:18.554
in regular contact with Pastor
Akumu for the past six weeks.

31:18.579 --> 31:20.485
We heard you two were pretty close.

31:20.967 --> 31:23.235
He helped you get through
a pretty dark place, huh?

31:23.303 --> 31:24.603
You loved him.

31:24.628 --> 31:27.664
Just like I did, just
like I still do, okay?

31:27.836 --> 31:30.110
I just want to find out
what happened to my uncle.

31:31.022 --> 31:32.957
If you know anything, anything at all...

31:35.672 --> 31:38.102
Pastor Akumu was the first
person I could open up to.

31:38.542 --> 31:39.805
I could just talk.

31:40.516 --> 31:41.553
No lectures.

31:41.578 --> 31:42.430
No judgments.

31:42.455 --> 31:45.180
Just... a regular G.

31:46.926 --> 31:48.468
But then I went and told him too much.

31:48.704 --> 31:50.338
Lewis, look at me.

31:51.406 --> 31:53.131
If you told him something damaging

31:53.156 --> 31:54.423
about someone in the gang life,

31:54.533 --> 31:56.067
we can protect you.

31:56.092 --> 31:57.827
Nah, I didn't piss off some gangbanger.

31:57.894 --> 31:59.929
It's bigger than that, okay?

32:00.039 --> 32:01.406
A lot bigger.

32:01.953 --> 32:03.666
Then help us put them behind bars

32:03.691 --> 32:05.227
where they belong.

32:10.407 --> 32:12.474
There's this guy on the county council.

32:13.403 --> 32:15.041
He's big in the drug game on the island.

32:15.066 --> 32:17.630
And... Pastor Akumu knew him.

32:17.825 --> 32:19.345
Councilman Mikala?

32:22.664 --> 32:24.698
He tells the gangs where to sell,

32:24.806 --> 32:28.424
where the cops won't bother 'em,
and in return they cut him in.

32:28.713 --> 32:30.414
Look, I wanted out of this life, okay?

32:30.439 --> 32:32.628
I was tired of hurting people, and

32:32.653 --> 32:34.453
Pastor Akumu made me
feel like I could change.

32:35.600 --> 32:37.634
What I told you about Mikala,

32:37.659 --> 32:39.259
that's why Akumu is dead now,

32:39.284 --> 32:40.684
and that councilman,

32:40.709 --> 32:44.353
he's not gonna stop there. I'm next.

32:44.454 --> 32:47.857
Hey, Lewis, look, you did
the right thing by telling us.

32:48.041 --> 32:50.279
And now we're gonna go do
our jobs and make sure that

32:50.304 --> 32:52.672
Councilman Mikala never
hurts anyone ever again.

33:16.068 --> 33:18.614
Michael Garcia. Five-O. Open up.

33:34.424 --> 33:36.525
- Clear.
- Clear.

33:36.636 --> 33:38.837
All right, so I'm guessing
these are our pirates.

33:38.862 --> 33:40.462
There's no gunshot wounds.

33:40.487 --> 33:42.160
So what happened? They were, uh,

33:42.185 --> 33:44.509
just cutting the heroin
and they just dropped dead?

33:44.577 --> 33:46.144
I'm not convinced this is heroin.

33:46.212 --> 33:48.583
Yes. Commander McGarrett. I need backup,

33:48.608 --> 33:50.964
and, uh, send us a Hazmat unit

33:50.989 --> 33:52.677
to 32 Kaholo Street.

33:59.803 --> 34:02.572
Get down! Down, down, down! Down!

34:14.161 --> 34:15.473
- Steve!
- What?

34:15.540 --> 34:17.375
I don't want to be in
the room with the powder

34:17.400 --> 34:18.833
that killed the people, okay?

34:19.418 --> 34:20.833
We don't have a choice.

34:20.859 --> 34:22.893
Backup's ten minutes out.

34:43.554 --> 34:45.322
They're all over the place.

35:05.119 --> 35:07.349
We need to get out of here
before this stuff kills us.

35:09.786 --> 35:11.286
I'm moving.

35:23.032 --> 35:24.032
Clear!

35:32.708 --> 35:35.243
Hey. You all right?

35:35.268 --> 35:37.722
Do I look like I'm okay?

35:41.808 --> 35:43.885
I'm better now!

35:43.910 --> 35:45.611
- What?
- What?

35:48.621 --> 35:51.293
Lawson thought he was just
ripping off a little heroin.

35:51.318 --> 35:52.886
That stuff was carfentanil.

35:53.037 --> 35:54.605
It's a synthetic opioid.

35:54.630 --> 35:56.898
It's 10,000 times
stronger than morphine.

35:56.923 --> 35:58.209
This stuff's banned from the
chemical weapons convention.

35:58.234 --> 35:59.601
It's that dangerous.

35:59.878 --> 36:02.380
Okay, well, that explains my
pounding headache, doesn't it?

36:02.405 --> 36:04.339
It's funny how these pirates

36:04.364 --> 36:05.917
went through all that trouble to steal

36:05.942 --> 36:07.909
their booty, only to end
up having it kill 'em.

36:07.934 --> 36:09.578
Yeah, well, no one said
they were good pirates.

36:09.603 --> 36:12.446
- Hmm.
- Oh, speaking of which, um,

36:12.471 --> 36:14.527
why are pirates called pirates?

36:16.620 --> 36:17.820
'Cause they "arr"!

36:19.164 --> 36:20.398
Come on!

36:20.423 --> 36:22.457
- That was solid.
- Bye.

36:22.525 --> 36:24.025
- Bye.
- That was a solid one.

36:24.050 --> 36:25.050
Yeah.

36:34.019 --> 36:35.769
What is that?

36:36.115 --> 36:39.261
This, Councilman Mikala, is
the oh so generous donation

36:39.286 --> 36:40.969
that you made to my uncle's church,

36:40.994 --> 36:42.928
that we will not be accepting.

36:42.953 --> 36:46.199
- It's also evidence.
- Wh-What are you talking about?

36:46.224 --> 36:47.758
We matched the DNA from that envelope

36:47.783 --> 36:49.760
to a DNA on a teacup that we found

36:49.785 --> 36:51.653
next to Akumu's kitchen sink.

36:51.764 --> 36:53.957
You must've been in a hurry
because you missed a spot

36:53.982 --> 36:55.949
- when you rinsed it.
- You were in his house

36:55.974 --> 36:58.035
when he died. You killed him.

36:58.060 --> 36:59.728
Ms. Cunha, I know you're upset, but...

36:59.753 --> 37:01.721
There was a second
teacup next to the sink,

37:01.746 --> 37:03.708
and it had traces of
flunitrazepam on it.

37:03.733 --> 37:04.966
Roofies.

37:04.991 --> 37:06.825
That's the one my uncle
drank from, isn't it?

37:06.850 --> 37:08.212
We're thinking that, when Akumu

37:08.237 --> 37:11.039
found out that you were
dirty, he confronted you,

37:11.064 --> 37:13.597
told you you needed to come
clean and turn yourself in.

37:14.420 --> 37:16.287
Maybe he even offered
to help counsel you

37:16.312 --> 37:17.646
through your difficult time.

37:17.671 --> 37:19.439
You accepted his offer,

37:19.464 --> 37:21.766
but you didn't go to Akumu's
house to take his advice.

37:21.791 --> 37:23.391
You went there to take his life.

37:23.416 --> 37:25.250
You roofied my uncle's tea.

37:25.275 --> 37:27.543
He would have started to
feel the effects in minutes.

37:27.568 --> 37:30.277
My guess is that you saw
he started to get woozy

37:30.302 --> 37:32.470
and oh so graciously offered
to take him to the doctor.

37:32.495 --> 37:34.406
You helped him to the car,
and once he passed out,

37:34.430 --> 37:36.675
you ran a hose from the
exhaust pipe into the window

37:36.700 --> 37:38.935
and let the carbon monoxide do the rest.

37:39.502 --> 37:40.869
You were counting on the cops

37:40.894 --> 37:43.808
taking one look at that
scene and ruling it a suicide.

37:44.273 --> 37:45.974
What you didn't count on

37:45.999 --> 37:48.550
is that my uncle helped
so many people in his life

37:48.575 --> 37:51.513
that some of them were
willing to help him in return.

37:55.767 --> 37:57.468
Sir, come with us.

37:58.152 --> 37:59.853
You have the right to remain silent...

38:11.289 --> 38:13.234
I'm proud of you, my ipo.

38:13.562 --> 38:15.446
And your Uncle Akumu

38:15.471 --> 38:17.593
would be so proud of you, too.

38:20.042 --> 38:21.467
