is bound to be forgotten.

26:26.226 --> 26:30.140
I see.
- I did not want this to him.

26:30.355 --> 26:34.981
He was involved in old man shit.
He?is only interested in the stripes.

26:35.192 --> 26:40.697
If they are not, there is a nice
not worth shit.

26:40.906 --> 26:48.118
I do not have natsoja, but I am
get the things.

26:49.664 --> 26:55.003
I made my first year in more arrests
than anyone else.

26:55.211 --> 27:00.917
It is god damn important.
- Absolutely.

27:05.221 --> 27:10.215
Who cares...

27:10.434 --> 27:15.392
If Chris wants it, may the
it.

27:15.606 --> 27:18.974
It's his life, not mine

27:20.735 --> 27:27.070
I was not a good father.
I have a lot of debt to him.

27:27.283 --> 27:33.368
I am still house in order, because
there's still time.

27:33.581 --> 27:40.461
I'll show her what kind of father I can be
. I'll start tonight.

27:44.967 --> 27:49.178
It is admirable, Mack.

27:54.643 --> 27:57.312
There are those guys.

28:18.332 --> 28:22.199
Who will it take? Simon Weeks.

28:26.715 --> 28:29.336
Now only.

28:31.219 --> 28:33.710
Wait.

28:40.895 --> 28:44.477
Good, Louis. Get out now.

28:47.025 --> 28:49.516
Wait.

28:51.738 --> 28:55.154
They go away if we call for help.

28:55.367 --> 29:00.159
I'm going to get there.
If they try to escape, you go after the other.

29:02.373 --> 29:05.623
Yes, I would call for help.
- Trust me.

29:05.835 --> 29:12.087
I know those guys. It will disappear as soon as
if you hear something.

29:12.299 --> 29:14.422
Do not call for help.

29:22.100 --> 29:27.095
Did you come here a big hoodie guy?
-1001, he went into the room.

29:27.314 --> 29:29.686
1001.

30:30.790 --> 30:36.579
<i>You promised you would not come here anymore.
- I need money for food. </ I></i>

30:36.796 --> 30:42.715
You promised.
- It does not change anything.

30:44.136 --> 30:47.837
Undress.

30:49.933 --> 30:53.053
Go take a shower.

31:09.660 --> 31:13.243
Fucking idiot!
- I'm sorry.

31:13.456 --> 31:15.448
I'm sorry nice!

31:15.666 --> 31:19.960
Is it fun to rape little girls?
- What's the matter with you?

31:20.170 --> 31:26.125
Let's talk
ago with a friend when he comes down.

31:26.343 --> 31:30.589
What is a friend?
- Simon Weeks.

31:30.805 --> 31:36.475
Looking for you Simon?
- What the hell?

31:44.068 --> 31:48.943

31:49.156 --> 31:52.240
McCanickin you a couple?
- So what?

31:52.451 --> 31:56.614
Weeks, a pinch Does he want something?
- Shut the fuck up.

31:56.830 --> 32:01.907
<i>Weeks is innocent. McCanick framed
murder of a man in the Congress. </ I></i>

32:02.127 --> 32:04.997
<i>He is a dishonest than that. </ I></i>

32:05.213 --> 32:11.381
You're all cops are bastards
similar.

32:13.596 --> 32:15.553
Damn.

32:22.688 --> 32:27.682
<i>What is it? </ I>

32:27.901 --> 32:31.151
<i>Thank you, baby. </ I></i>

32:42.164 --> 32:45.414
Mack.
- What the fuck are you doing here?

32:45.626 --> 32:50.786
I tried to call you.
What the hell is going on?

32:51.006 --> 32:55.086
Go back down.
- Gubb is a girl.

32:55.302 --> 33:00.842
He is in the car in the back seat. -What's he doing there
? What about the dress?

33:01.057 --> 33:06.763
Simon Weeks, you know?

33:06.980 --> 33:10.183
Do you know something about a man murdered
Congress?

33:10.400 --> 33:13.934
Holy shit!
- Yes. What are we doing here?

33:14.153 --> 33:16.691
Cops!

Watch out!

34:31.434 --> 34:33.889

34:35.313 --> 34:37.353
Well...

36:37.721 --> 36:40.046
Mack.

36:40.265 --> 36:43.301
Damn it.

36:44.394 --> 36:49.470
Floyd? Oh come on.

36:53.527 --> 36:57.774

36:57.990 --> 37:01.193

37:08.249 --> 37:14.252

I'm sorry, forgive me...

37:23.305 --> 37:25.843

37:26.058 --> 37:31.598
Where's the fucking ambulance is?

37:35.692 --> 37:42.275
I'm Sergeant Ainsley.
Are you okay?

37:43.825 --> 37:48.036
Parisi is in the hospital.
They do their best.

37:48.246 --> 37:52.113
It looks pretty bad.

37:52.333 --> 37:58.916
The guy that shot, it was a pig.
You did us a favor.

38:03.510 --> 38:11.256
I have to ask. Your partner in shot.
Can you tell me anything about it?

38:20.526 --> 38:25.484
Simon... Weeks.

38:27.449 --> 38:30.023
Who?

38:31.870 --> 38:36.746
Weeks. Simon Weeks.

38:36.958 --> 38:42.165
We'll take care of this. Wait a minute.

38:44.465 --> 38:48.795
Ainsley here.
Do you want a clear one's name?

39:27.882 --> 39:33.670
This is... This is Detective
Eugene McCanick.

39:33.887 --> 39:40.684
I would like to ask how can Floyd Intrator.

40:38.448 --> 40:41.864
I just paid $ 50 bucks.
- Get a good job.

40:42.077 --> 40:45.492
I make good money as long as the cops do not come in between

40:45.705 --> 40:51.079
I was wrong.
We found a friend.

40:51.294 --> 40:55.042
Peter Raven is Courtner
and he's from Queens.

40:55.256 --> 41:01.258
Is he well?
- He disappeared when Langley was shot.

41:01.470 --> 41:07.140
Only you know Raven and
Langley. Think a little bit.

41:07.351 --> 41:12.345
You might have forgotten to tell you something?

41:15.483 --> 41:19.860
Some of the friends whom Raven would have mentioned?

41:20.071 --> 41:24.365
Places where they wanted to go?
Anything.

41:27.411 --> 41:33.532
When did you last eat?

41:35.085 --> 41:38.371
Go to the back seat and sit down.
I'll buy you breakfast.

41:39.715 --> 41:43.582
Go to the back seat.

42:12.913 --> 42:15.582
"11 missed calls"

42:24.257 --> 42:27.922
<i>All the cars, keep an eye on
detective McCanickia. </ I></i>

42:28.135 --> 42:33.556
<i>He has a blue sweater and jeans.
Detective McCanick is... </ i></i>

42:40.814 --> 42:43.020
Louis.

42:49.447 --> 42:52.780
Why are you running for?
- You drive me back.

42:52.992 --> 42:57.239
I just want to talk to you.

43:24.022 --> 43:30.937
Weeks... You said that he is clean.

43:31.153 --> 43:34.818
So he is.

43:35.032 --> 43:39.990
Are you afraid of him?
- I do not. He's a good guy.

43:43.039 --> 43:47.251
He is a hell of a fraud.

43:47.460 --> 43:53.083
No, he helps young people now.
Young people appreciate him.

43:54.550 --> 43:57.635
He is a murderer.
- None.

43:57.845 --> 44:01.759
What is he doing here?
- To help young people off the street.

44:01.974 --> 44:08.593
He will not help anyone!
- He is an old koulullaan.

44:08.814 --> 44:13.522
What school?

44:36.090 --> 44:41.962
Take it easy.
Did not your mother give you food?

44:42.179 --> 44:45.133
Not have a mother.

44:45.348 --> 44:49.263
What about your father?
- I'm alone.

44:52.689 --> 44:57.896
Where do you live?
- Here and there.

44:58.110 --> 45:01.230
Do not you have ever been to the parents?
- No.

45:01.447 --> 45:06.785
Who you have taken care of?
- Alice. He...

45:13.959 --> 45:19.545
Who is Alice may be, he is certainly
worried about you.

45:21.758 --> 45:25.506
So... Langley.

45:26.637 --> 45:31.015
You met him a few times. Was
Raven comes with time?

45:31.225 --> 45:37.762
I'm not gay.
- It's none of my business.

45:37.982 --> 45:41.896
It is easily
she have money but I do not like it.

45:42.110 --> 45:44.436
Right.

45:45.781 --> 45:51.071
Do you have a family?
- I have a wife.

45:52.162 --> 45:57.500
Children?
- One of the boy.

45:59.043 --> 46:01.830
Just as I thought.

46:03.464 --> 46:06.381
You are definitely a good father.

46:12.347 --> 46:15.633
<i>Good. Do you take a break? </ I></i>

46:15.851 --> 46:20.726
<i>five minutes.
Take a little bread and juice. </ I></i>

46:20.939 --> 46:24.142
<i>Tonita </?i></i>

46:24.359 --> 46:26.980
<i>easy. </ I></i>

46:30.907 --> 46:36.363
sounded pretty good.
- Thank you.

46:36.579 --> 46:41.655
Are you Alice?
- I am.

46:41.875 --> 46:46.584
Detective McCanick.
- I remember you at the trial.

46:48.048 --> 46:50.455
Yes.

46:52.302 --> 46:55.635
I am looking for Simon.

46:56.806 --> 47:01.966
He?reportedly helps young people here.

47:02.186 --> 47:06.314
You are wrong.
I do not know where Simon is.

47:06.524 --> 47:09.690
Do you know that he is on parole?
- I do not.

47:09.902 --> 47:16.355
You know where he is. You would have otherwise
said that he is in prison.

47:20.704 --> 47:24.452
I heard that he has been released.
- Do you know where he lives?

47:24.666 --> 47:27.869
What do you want from him?
He?has suffered judgment.

47:29.921 --> 47:35.544
He killed a cop today.
- What?

47:35.760 --> 47:38.333
He killed...
- I heard.

47:43.267 --> 47:49.435
Simon was brought here from the age of 6.
His mother had been forced to treat.

47:49.648 --> 47:55.816
When he was 15, I surprised her from selling weed
some of the boys.

47:56.029 --> 47:58.567
He ran away.

47:58.781 --> 48:04.404
There were rumors that he lived on the street
and sold themselves.

48:04.620 --> 48:07.241
I went to look for him again.

48:07.456 --> 48:12.118
Then called and told
that he had been arrested.

48:12.336 --> 48:16.036
That he had shot a man in one of the hotel

48:20.927 --> 48:24.592
I know Simon.

48:24.806 --> 48:30.725
He has done stupid things
but he is not a murderer.

48:30.937 --> 48:34.306
You do not know him that well
than you think.

48:34.523 --> 48:41.356
The guy he shot,
became whores, and was a son of a bitch.

48:41.572 --> 48:48.452
Maybe he gave to Simon,
turbine or said the wrong thing.

48:50.539 --> 48:56.493
Son, who is in a situation where
a background...

48:56.711 --> 49:00.756
He or she may lose self-control.

49:00.965 --> 49:06.719
He killed
Joe Langley, and he killed the police today.

49:06.929 --> 49:10.761
I do not think so.
- He killed a cop.

49:10.975 --> 49:14.758
He killed my partner.

52:20.988 --> 52:27.524
"I better every day.
I have found my place."

52:31.664 --> 52:38.378
"I think that will be my birthday,
finally a good day."

52:44.844 --> 52:50.383
"JoJo thinks I'm
found my place."

52:50.599 --> 52:54.466
"Lord, I want to accept..."

52:54.686 --> 52:58.387
"I ate cheesecake for breakfast."

54:52.631 --> 54:55.916
A phone bill - SIMON WEEKS

55:19.823 --> 55:23.821
<i>I did not hit our son. </ I></i>

55:24.036 --> 55:27.405
I did not hit him.
It's a paranoid crap.

55:27.623 --> 55:33.495
Because of that, I'm angry.
I understand what he is doing.

55:33.712 --> 55:38.954
No, he wants to be a police officer. He does it just to piss
me.

55:39.175 --> 55:43.220
I do not let him throw a
to go in their lives.

55:43.429 --> 55:48.221
Do not fucking yell at me! Stop it.

55:48.434 --> 55:51.304
Hello?

56:05.367 --> 56:07.406
Son of a bitch.

56:08.578 --> 56:12.907
<i>Stop!
- Leave me alone! </ I></i>

56:13.124 --> 56:18.201
What the hell?
- Release!

56:18.421 --> 56:23.047
Or do you feel like to put little boys,
bastard!

56:23.258 --> 56:28.300
Try this, you sick fuck!

56:48.449 --> 56:54.617
<i>What do you want? </ I>
- I just want to talk.</i>

56:54.830 --> 56:57.036
<i>Wait. </ I></i>

57:05.006 --> 57:10.676
<i>Drive to 18th Street and the corner of Morse.
There is a deserted house. </ I></i>

57:13.014 --> 57:15.683
<i>I'll meet you there. </ I></i>

58:53.400 --> 58:57.065
Where is Simon Weeks?

58:57.279 --> 59:02.783
Are you going to shoot me? Go for it!
I am a police officer!

59:02.993 --> 59:05.235
Where is Simon Weeks?

59:05.454 --> 59:11.741
Guns. Get on your knees!

59:11.960 --> 59:16.040
Where is Simon Weeks?
- Who?

59:16.255 --> 59:19.541
Where is Simon Weeks?
- I do not know anyone...

59:35.148 --> 59:39.893
What the hell man you think you are?

59:42.906 --> 59:47.614
Fuck off.
- Fuck yourself, you stupid moron.

59:47.827 --> 59:53.497
Who told you to come here alone?
Are you a Popeye Doyle?

01:00:08.138 --> 01:00:13.927
I had to search the broadcast you.
Do you know what it looks like?

01:00:14.143 --> 01:00:19.350
Police inspectors need to search the broadcast
own is looking for.

01:00:19.565 --> 01:00:23.729
Been calling me a lot.
- I did not know any cover-up.

01:00:23.944 --> 01:00:28.820
Fuck operation!

01:00:29.033 --> 01:00:32.199
What is it about?
- Holy shit!

01:00:32.411 --> 01:00:36.076
Floyd shot in the chest in the morning!

01:00:38.083 --> 01:00:43.290
Ainsley said that Weeks shot.
What the hell happened there?

01:00:43.505 --> 01:00:47.253
I...
- Mack, what happened?

01:00:47.467 --> 01:00:54.180
I wanted to talk with him. Know
that he planned anything.

01:00:54.390 --> 01:01:01.139
His friend came to surprise me.

01:01:01.355 --> 01:01:03.561
Weeks went crazy.

01:01:05.609 --> 01:01:11.896
Weeks shot Floyd.
- I shot.

01:01:18.913 --> 01:01:23.622
What happened 7 years ago,
is one thing.

01:01:23.834 --> 01:01:29.291
You had a hard time with your family
and gave the story to suffer for it.

01:01:29.506 --> 01:01:35.046
It was either give you
collapse or be a drug chap in jail.

01:01:35.262 --> 01:01:39.306
But this is not the case huumeveikosta.
The police murder will not be forgotten.

01:01:39.516 --> 01:01:43.763
It asked for and will not be stopped before the
as been answered.

01:01:44.896 --> 01:01:48.265
You had really good luck
when the boy did not say anything.

01:01:48.483 --> 01:01:53.441
I said, let it be
but when you do!

01:01:53.654 --> 01:01:57.699
If it turns out what we have done,
fucked you are not just you -

01:01:57.908 --> 01:02:03.662
but also for me, Bronson, Howeth
and Gage. All of it!

01:02:03.872 --> 01:02:10.159
10000 We will have to jail delivered by
son of a bitch to accompany!

01:02:10.378 --> 01:02:12.537
Do you understand?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:02:12.756 --> 01:02:15.044
Yeah.

01:02:20.430 --> 01:02:26.633
Oh, shit. Let's do this.
You go to the hospital.

01:02:26.852 --> 01:02:32.273
You're going to greet your partner in
, and then you go home and stay there.

01:02:32.483 --> 01:02:35.483
No more Weeksiä and nothing else.

01:02:35.694 --> 01:02:39.941
Floyd, and then go home. Is that clear?

01:02:43.994 --> 01:02:47.991
How is it dinner with Chris?

01:02:50.917 --> 01:02:54.499
I have to take your gun.

01:02:58.924 --> 01:03:01.711
Your weapon, Mack.

01:03:08.016 --> 01:03:14.765
Will Floyd back to life?
- I have to pray.

01:03:16.357 --> 01:03:19.892
The ballistic report will come tomorrow.

01:03:20.111 --> 01:03:23.278
I hope you're telling the truth.

01:05:55.425 --> 01:05:58.260
Eugene!

01:06:15.861 --> 01:06:19.561
<i> Detective Chris McCanick here.
I'll start on Monday. </ I></i>

01:06:19.781 --> 01:06:24.158
<i>Leave a message and I'll call. </ I></i>

01:06:24.369 --> 01:06:26.942
Chris, the father of this.

01:06:27.163 --> 01:06:34.458
I wanted to... just call -

01:06:34.670 --> 01:06:37.587
and thank that you want to meet me.

01:06:37.798 --> 01:06:42.543
I booked a table
fine restaurant.

01:06:42.761 --> 01:06:48.466
Let's eat good food, take a couple of
drink and be pampered ourselves.

01:06:48.683 --> 01:06:51.221
It's not a big deal.

01:06:51.436 --> 01:06:58.268
Learn to know each other again only
and celebrated a fun evening.

01:07:00.528 --> 01:07:03.398
<i>... </ I></i>

01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:10.283
<i>I wanted to let you know that... </ i></i>

01:07:10.496 --> 01:07:17.791
I begin to say things
but it is not true.

01:07:19.337 --> 01:07:23.204
<i>Do not let them worry you. </ I></i>

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:28.963
It all went to hell.

01:07:30.348 --> 01:07:34.559
<i> I do not know, forget it.
I just wanted to say... </ i></i>

01:07:34.769 --> 01:07:39.976
<i>I want to hear it from me. </ I></i>

01:07:40.190 --> 01:07:43.440
<i>I want to hear it from me. </ I></i>

01:07:43.652 --> 01:07:48.894
What, then, happens, I'll just say it
I'm proud of you.

01:07:49.115 --> 01:07:56.327
<i>I know that I've said things and
... </ i></i>

01:07:56.539 --> 01:08:01.580
<i>treated you badly.
I was a bad father. </ I></i>

01:08:02.837 --> 01:08:05.672
<i>It's in the past now. </ I></i>

01:08:05.881 --> 01:08:12.630
Whatever you do in your life -

01:08:12.846 --> 01:08:15.467
it suits me very well.

01:08:16.683 --> 01:08:22.720
Whatever happens,
I want you to remember -

01:08:29.362 --> 01:08:33.359
that I am your father.

01:08:34.783 --> 01:08:37.868
And you are my son.

01:08:38.078 --> 01:08:41.993
Even if someone else would say what,
it does not change.

01:10:33.187 --> 01:10:36.223
What do you want from me?

01:11:17.104 --> 01:11:20.473
Forget it.

01:11:47.674 --> 01:11:53.297
Gene. Oops. Come inside.

01:11:55.974 --> 01:11:59.806
Do you want a towel or something?

01:12:09.945 --> 01:12:12.780
I found the Raven.

01:12:12.990 --> 01:12:16.857
What? Is he well?

01:12:19.997 --> 01:12:24.954
He's dead.
- What?

01:12:25.168 --> 01:12:29.960
She was found in the motel Jersey.

01:12:30.173 --> 01:12:34.040
He was slashed wrists.

01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:38.922
He is in the morgue
unrecognized.

01:12:42.268 --> 01:12:45.719
I'm sorry.

01:13:18.594 --> 01:13:25.260
Look...
Should we think of this?

01:13:25.475 --> 01:13:29.473
Raven may not be killed at all
Joe Langleyä.

01:13:31.773 --> 01:13:35.770
We did not come to think of it.

01:13:35.985 --> 01:13:39.271
It could have been anyone.

01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:45.987
He's dead.
- I know.

01:13:46.203 --> 01:13:52.621
Maybe we panic.

01:13:52.834 --> 01:13:56.618
Options are a hundred.

01:13:56.838 --> 01:14:02.841
We should continue its investigation.

01:14:07.432 --> 01:14:12.010
I want to be sure that we get caught up
a real person.

01:14:12.228 --> 01:14:16.771
Raven is dead.
In his favor, I can not do anything.

01:14:16.982 --> 01:14:21.478
But I can help you.

01:14:23.739 --> 01:14:28.447
You do not have to live like this.

01:14:29.953 --> 01:14:31.992
You can stay at my place.

01:14:51.974 --> 01:14:53.931
Damn!

01:15:35.265 --> 01:15:40.555
Look and feel? What do you live in?

01:15:40.770 --> 01:15:44.850
I mean...

01:15:45.066 --> 01:15:48.399
I have a small apartment in the city.

01:15:48.611 --> 01:15:55.112
Many of the police are.
I live there right now.

01:15:55.325 --> 01:16:00.912
Change
there for a while until you get on your feet.

01:16:01.122 --> 01:16:04.990
It's not a big deal.

01:16:05.210 --> 01:16:09.373
It is a pretty nice apartment.

01:16:09.589 --> 01:16:13.421
A small but cozy.

01:16:15.219 --> 01:16:21.174
Can I live there?
- If you want to.

01:16:22.935 --> 01:16:28.889
With you?
- Yes.

01:16:31.902 --> 01:16:38.105
You do not want to.
- Yes it can be done.

01:16:39.951 --> 01:16:42.406
What about your wife?

01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:48.492
He lives in our house.

01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:54.498
He does not even need to know if it
feel better.

01:16:56.508 --> 01:16:59.379
Your son?

01:17:03.223 --> 01:17:05.761
My son has changed.

01:17:27.829 --> 01:17:32.408
Stop, you bastard!

01:17:32.626 --> 01:17:34.832
Holy shit!

01:17:55.898 --> 01:17:58.934
This.

01:18:12.955 --> 01:18:15.244
What are you doing?

01:18:15.458 --> 01:18:17.746
Stop!

01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:21.495
Out of the car!

01:18:21.714 --> 01:18:24.798
What are you doing?

01:18:47.196 --> 01:18:51.692
<i>Became a technical fault.
The train standing in a few minutes. </ I></i>

01:20:28.792 --> 01:20:33.703
It's okay.
- No, no.

01:20:33.922 --> 01:20:38.631
You are mistaken.
- Do not say that.

01:20:38.843 --> 01:20:43.090
You are mistaken.
- I'm not.

01:20:45.475 --> 01:20:50.516
Quit Now only. Stop it.

01:20:50.730 --> 01:20:54.098
Just let it happen.

01:20:55.734 --> 01:20:58.308
God...

01:21:53.789 --> 01:21:59.080
How long
Kyttänen me before you came?

01:21:59.294 --> 01:22:06.092
How long?
Two weeks or months?

01:22:14.392 --> 01:22:19.896
Do you think really that I would like to live with you?

01:22:26.403 --> 01:22:29.737
L...

01:22:33.994 --> 01:22:38.821
You piilohintit
're all the same.

01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:45.754
When you finally you realize who you kii-
calls on, do you think that it is love.

01:22:45.964 --> 01:22:48.964
Shut up.

01:22:49.175 --> 01:22:56.173
What? Am I looking the same as
best friend in school?

01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:59.225
Shut up.

01:22:59.435 --> 01:23:04.227
Or am I your wife with a dick?

01:23:07.567 --> 01:23:10.354
Fucking fagot.

01:23:11.446 --> 01:23:13.604
Shut the fuck up...

01:23:16.075 --> 01:23:19.859
I said shut up!

01:24:16.174 --> 01:24:19.175
Go to hell.

01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:25.714
Unit 40-17.

01:24:25.933 --> 01:24:30.429
I ask for confirmation to
1527 Gerard.

01:24:30.646 --> 01:24:34.513
The apartment has a murder suspect.

01:24:34.733 --> 01:24:37.402
Go to hell.

01:27:31.942 --> 01:27:36.189
Why did you make me do this?

01:27:37.573 --> 01:27:40.858
I did not want to hurt you.

01:27:43.203 --> 01:27:49.822
I wanted to... I just wanted to talk.

01:28:57.023 --> 01:29:00.392
Why did not you say anything?

01:29:15.666 --> 01:29:20.327
Why do not you tell people about me?

01:29:20.545 --> 01:29:26.963
From what happened that night.
Why?

01:29:28.511 --> 01:29:31.547
Answer me.

01:29:33.641 --> 01:29:37.389
Therefore,, that is not your fault.

01:30:26.232 --> 01:30:29.186
No... No.

01:30:29.402 --> 01:30:33.945
Gene, I do not want to die.

01:30:36.617 --> 01:30:39.618
Please...

01:30:42.414 --> 01:30:44.739
Go to.

01:30:49.713 --> 01:30:52.038
Get out of here.

01:31:19.866 --> 01:31:22.950
I'm sorry.

01:31:25.950 --> 01:31:29.950
