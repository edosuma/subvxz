00:01.929 --> 00:05.019
- Previously on Angel:
- The Host reads their souls.

00:05.530 --> 00:07.389
But only when they sing karaoke.

00:07.929 --> 00:12.320
Imagine what could have happened if
you'd gone nuts and slept with Darla.

00:18.129 --> 00:19.739
I would never do that.

00:20.530 --> 00:24.079
Get out. The next time I see you,
I'll have to kill you.

00:24.730 --> 00:29.079
I cannot help you. No man can.
This is not meant to be known.

00:30.730 --> 00:36.460
I guess there's only one thing
left to do. Time to go visit Daddy.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.074

02:00.129 --> 02:03.989
Monseigneur Rivalli performed the
ceremony when Caroline and I wed.

02:04.930 --> 02:10.550
- You remember Caroline.
- A pretty lass. Hardy screamer.

02:12.129 --> 02:14.159
The monseigneur's been excommunicated.

02:14.530 --> 02:18.219
His order, Inquisitori,
adheres to the old beliefs.

02:19.330 --> 02:22.280
They're traditionalists
and good at their work.

02:22.930 --> 02:25.490
Let's get started, shall we?

02:43.330 --> 02:45.930
You lost me in North Africa.

02:46.330 --> 02:50.509
I knew you'd come back to Europe.
But Rome, Angelus?

02:51.729 --> 02:55.210
Why would you come
to the seat of all that's holy?

02:57.129 --> 03:00.960
- Darla. She loves the Sistine Chapel.
- Michelangelo?

03:01.930 --> 03:05.229
Not him.
She's mad about Boticelli's frescoes.

03:06.129 --> 03:10.770
The Temptation of Christ is her
favorite because of the leper.

03:11.530 --> 03:14.969
- What do you want, Holtz?
- I don't want anything.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.620
My family's gone.

03:18.129 --> 03:22.270
I don't trust you to give me Darla,
although I will find her.

03:23.530 --> 03:27.599
My only desire is to discover
if a thing such as yourself...

03:28.330 --> 03:30.050
...can be made to pay for its sins.

03:33.129 --> 03:36.080
You're a demon.
Your nature is to maim and kill.

03:36.729 --> 03:38.520
But you were also once a man.

03:39.129 --> 03:44.009
If we beat and burn the demon out
of you, will there be anything left?

03:45.129 --> 03:46.669
Anything at all?

03:46.930 --> 03:51.990
I doubt it, but I'm willing to spend
the next fortnight finding out.

03:53.530 --> 03:56.789
In either event, you have no soul.
You cannot be saved.

03:58.930 --> 04:01.139
Sorry it took me so long, darling.

04:02.530 --> 04:04.389
Kill them.

04:38.529 --> 04:40.069
Grazie, padre,

05:01.329 --> 05:02.199
- Darling...
- What?

05:02.529 --> 05:04.040
...shouldn't we be killing Holtz?

05:04.329 --> 05:06.649
But it's so much fun,
ruining his life.

05:07.329 --> 05:09.790
He's like family now.

05:19.329 --> 05:22.310
Thanks for the lift.
That didn't take long at all.

05:22.930 --> 05:26.790
And they say there's no
public transportation in L.A.

05:36.129 --> 05:39.750
Help! We got a Code 12
on the 5-8 line!

06:47.449 --> 06:48.779
What's this?

06:49.250 --> 06:52.509
It's just so dark down here
I thought I'd brighten it up.

06:53.449 --> 06:56.750
You can't exactly go out and
enjoy the sunny fields of nature...

06:57.050 --> 07:00.379
...but that doesn't mean we can't bring
a little bloom into your darkness.

07:03.050 --> 07:05.189
- Fake.
- Put something real in here...

07:06.050 --> 07:07.800
...and it'll die like that:

07:09.649 --> 07:11.509
- Thank you?
- I've been around--

07:11.449 --> 07:16.120
Which reminds me, next birthday, can
we skip the 250 candles on the cake...

07:17.449 --> 07:21.519
- ...and just go with a little song?
- And I've never known anyone like you.

07:22.250 --> 07:26.819
Time's a wasting, big guy.
Can we do it?

07:28.850 --> 07:32.430
Okay. Last time, we worked
on not pulling your punches.

07:33.050 --> 07:34.980
Don't worry about me.
That's good.

07:35.449 --> 07:36.819
Good.

07:37.250 --> 07:40.230
That's it. Where's your weight?
Don't forget to--

07:40.850 --> 07:44.500
Oh, God! You said to--
Are you all right?

07:45.649 --> 07:47.579
I'm a vampire. You can't hurt me.

07:48.050 --> 07:50.149
- Good.
- You're off your game.

07:50.449 --> 07:53.709
It's the prophecy Wes and Gunn
are trying to get.

07:54.050 --> 07:56.680
- You think the end is coming.
- The end is not coming.

07:57.649 --> 08:00.110
Someone always uncovers
some ancient scroll...

08:00.649 --> 08:02.970
... that says something terrible
is coming.

08:03.649 --> 08:06.740
Do you know how many
of these things I've seen?

08:07.250 --> 08:09.740
- Four?
- Three, but don't worry.

08:10.250 --> 08:12.850
Then why are they breaking
and entering right now?

08:13.250 --> 08:15.810
Breaking and entering
is such a negative term.

08:16.850 --> 08:20.290
They're retrieving pieces
of a Nyazian scroll to confirm--

08:20.449 --> 08:22.620
That the end is coming.

08:23.449 --> 08:26.009
All we can do is live each moment
to the fullest...

08:26.449 --> 08:30.170
...and be glad we didn't lose
all our money in the NASDAQ.

08:31.250 --> 08:32.830
Am I swelling?

08:45.970 --> 08:50.990
Step one: Dobermans are gnawing steak,
alarm and vid lines are disabled...

08:51.970 --> 08:53.509
...no infrared. Lucky break.

08:54.370 --> 08:58.549
Step two: Cut a hole, snake the
minicam in, scan the interior.

08:59.169 --> 09:04.789
If it's clear, we disable the locks
on the side door, thus completing...

09:06.970 --> 09:09.179
...step three.

09:26.769 --> 09:28.519
Thank you,

09:36.370 --> 09:38.649
Can you believe this?

09:40.570 --> 09:44.500
Some guys collect old cars.
Some guys--

09:50.769 --> 09:54.740
It's like the eye follows you
wherever you go.

10:06.370 --> 10:10.940
If you were a priceless Nyazian scroll,
where would you be?

10:11.769 --> 10:16.230
If I was priceless....
I'd be in the vault.

10:17.169 --> 10:20.500
The vault? Your snitch never said
anything about a vault.

10:21.370 --> 10:22.950
I got a bad feeling.

10:23.169 --> 10:25.769
We'll figure something out.
It's just a vault.

10:26.169 --> 10:30.879
My bad feeling is more about the man
standing behind you with a large gun.

10:32.169 --> 10:34.559
Move, and I'll kill you.

10:35.169 --> 10:37.769
- I hope you call the police.
- I am.

10:38.769 --> 10:41.610
Good. You can explain why you
have so much GHB.

10:42.370 --> 10:45.740
You know, Rohypnol,
the date-rape drug.

10:45.970 --> 10:48.950
- What?
- Used as a trancing amalgam.

10:49.570 --> 10:53.539
Under the microscope, it's virtually
indistinguishable from GHB.

10:57.370 --> 11:02.179
- All right, I won't call the police.
- I'm glad we understand each other.

11:02.769 --> 11:04.980
- Until after I kill you.
- Oh.

11:06.370 --> 11:09.320
- Hey, these worth a lot?
- Yes.

11:09.970 --> 11:13.870
- They're Cyopian conjuring spheres.
- How much? Four figures each?

11:14.769 --> 11:16.700
- Stop that.
- Put the weapon down.

11:19.570 --> 11:22.759
Kind of delicate. We're not thieves,
we're investigators.

11:23.769 --> 11:26.370
We need to look at your
Nyazian scroll.

11:26.769 --> 11:29.679
- I'm getting kind of tired here.
- All right.

11:35.769 --> 11:37.279
Always wanna finish big.

11:39.049 --> 11:44.000
- Ow. That doesn't feel right.
- Just relax. You have to bend.

11:45.049 --> 11:47.539
I don't bend there.

11:48.049 --> 11:50.120
Now, that's downright unnatural.

11:51.049 --> 11:53.649
If you're attacked from behind...

11:54.049 --> 11:57.139
...shift all your weight
to your other foot...

11:57.649 --> 12:00.629
...so you can spin and kick.
You try it.

12:01.250 --> 12:04.480
Easy. All right, that's better.

12:05.450 --> 12:08.539
We'll keep working on it.
That's enough for today.

12:09.049 --> 12:14.350
We could do more, but then I'd have
to ice every bone in my body. See you.

12:15.649 --> 12:18.039
- Hey, Fred.
- Hey.

12:18.649 --> 12:20.159
Kyrumption.

12:21.049 --> 12:22.769
Well, back at you.

12:23.450 --> 12:25.340
- What did you say?
- Kyrumption.

12:25.850 --> 12:30.100
It's the one nice word I remember
from the Pylean hell dimension.

12:31.250 --> 12:34.870
- What's it mean?
- It's when two heroes meet in battle...

12:35.450 --> 12:37.240
...and recognize their fate.

12:37.850 --> 12:41.220
It's also a grog made of ox dung,
but that's archaic.

12:42.049 --> 12:44.009
Well, that's interesting.

12:45.049 --> 12:50.419
When I see you and Cordelia sparring,
kyrumption always comes to mind.

12:52.250 --> 12:54.809
Me and Cordelia?

12:55.850 --> 13:01.259
I know. She's such a hero,
with the visions and the courage.

13:03.049 --> 13:06.240
It's only natural you two
are drawn to one another.

13:07.250 --> 13:11.289
Plastic flowers, my favorite.
They never fade, you know.

13:12.049 --> 13:15.379
There's nothing going on between
me and Cordelia.

13:16.250 --> 13:19.129
- Nothing but moira.
- Who's Moira?

13:19.850 --> 13:23.080
Moira's the gut attraction
between larger than life souls.

13:24.049 --> 13:28.580
No. There's no attraction. Cordelia's
a friend, someone I work with.

13:29.450 --> 13:33.950
See? You're being chivalrous because
you're a hero. You've got kyrumption.

13:34.250 --> 13:37.230
- Stop using that word!
- What's going on down here?

13:38.450 --> 13:41.570
- Nothing.
- Fred doesn't need to be shouted at.

13:42.049 --> 13:43.799
He didn't mean anything by it.

13:46.850 --> 13:50.330
- Is there something you wanted?
- Gunn and I were hoping...

13:51.049 --> 13:53.220
...you could help with the prophecies.
We need someone to do the math.

13:53.450 --> 13:54.679
Sure.

14:02.450 --> 14:05.610
- Who gave you all the flowers?
- Nobody.

14:09.169 --> 14:12.889
- So how you doing, Fred?
- It's a simple equation, really.

14:13.370 --> 14:16.919
The ancient Roman calendar had
1464 days in a four-year cycle.

14:18.169 --> 14:20.840
The Etruscan, Sumerian and Dradian
have their own cycles.

14:21.169 --> 14:23.799
Work forward from the presumed date
of the prophecy...

14:24.169 --> 14:28.909
...under each calendar, factoring in
our own 365-day calendar and....

14:32.570 --> 14:37.909
That can't be right,
unless the world ended last March.

14:38.570 --> 14:41.059
We talking Armageddon
or a bad house number?

14:42.169 --> 14:44.940
- Is it a bad event or a bad guy?
- It's not clear.

14:45.169 --> 14:47.590
It predicts the arrival
of the Tro-Clon...

14:48.169 --> 14:50.799
...a being that brings
mankind's ruination.

14:51.769 --> 14:53.419
A two-for-one. That's nice.

14:53.570 --> 14:57.080
I'm not clear on the translation.
Ruination may, in fact, be purification.

14:57.769 --> 14:59.940
Purification?
So this is a good thing?

15:00.769 --> 15:04.809
I doubt that. It's "purification"
in Aramaic, "ruination" in Greek...

15:05.570 --> 15:07.289
...and in Ga-Shundi, it's both.

15:07.970 --> 15:10.710
And you don't want to make
the same mistake twice.

15:12.169 --> 15:14.940
- No.
- What mistake?

15:16.370 --> 15:18.440
There was a prophecy a while back.

15:19.370 --> 15:22.139
It was about Angel and used
the word "shanshu"...

15:22.370 --> 15:24.899
...which I thought meant "to die,"
and I told Angel....

15:25.970 --> 15:29.129
- That he was going to die.
- Oh, no.

15:29.570 --> 15:33.919
Then I found out it also meant
"to live. " It means both.

15:34.970 --> 15:36.789
- So which is it?
- Both.

15:37.370 --> 15:40.879
In his case, it meant that the vampire
in him might die...

15:41.570 --> 15:46.100
- ...but the human in him might live.
- That he'd be like a normal man?

15:46.970 --> 15:49.460
- Yes.
- Wow.

15:50.570 --> 15:52.570
What would we do if that happened?

15:52.970 --> 15:56.450
I'd buy him some plaid shirts
and take him to the beach.

15:57.169 --> 16:00.649
- The boy needs some color.
- There.

16:01.970 --> 16:06.570
That came out better.
No, it didn't.

16:07.370 --> 16:10.879
It's preliminary, but if these
calculations are correct...

16:11.570 --> 16:14.240
...this bad thing
should already be here.

16:16.370 --> 16:20.620
Well, I guess not right here,
but here in L.A.

16:21.169 --> 16:23.659
Let me run those numbers again.

16:25.129 --> 16:26.429
Hey.

16:26.929 --> 16:28.750
Hey.

16:34.730 --> 16:38.870
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- No reason.

16:47.929 --> 16:51.549
Okay, it's getting creepy now.

16:53.929 --> 16:58.179
I was just thinking about things.
People. You know, how they relate.

16:59.330 --> 17:04.039
Take you and me, for instance.
We're very different, obviously.

17:04.730 --> 17:06.450
Human. Vampire.

17:07.130 --> 17:10.539
Woman. Man...pire.

17:11.930 --> 17:14.210
Has someone been putting vodka
in your blood?

17:16.730 --> 17:20.140
You're funny. I get off a good one
now and then, but you--

17:20.930 --> 17:23.809
Angel, are you trying
to say you love me?

17:23.930 --> 17:26.769
- What?
- I love you too.

17:27.529 --> 17:29.279
You do?

17:30.529 --> 17:32.630
- When--?
- Angel loves me. I love him.

17:32.930 --> 17:34.930
- Oh, my God.
- And we love you guys.

17:35.329 --> 17:36.410
We love you, Angel!

17:37.130 --> 17:42.500
They were all saying it in case
this prophecy comes true, and we die.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.609
- You're not gonna want a hug, are you?
- No.

17:50.329 --> 17:53.490
- We've been through a lot.
- That's all I was saying.

17:53.930 --> 17:58.109
We've been through so much together,
you and me, as friends.

17:59.930 --> 18:04.349
You've seen the good
and the not so good.

18:05.329 --> 18:06.839
Just like you have in me.

18:07.130 --> 18:11.630
And for the record, the good I've seen
far outweighs the bad.

18:13.130 --> 18:16.750
- Thanks. You too.
- Hey, what are friends for?

18:17.329 --> 18:21.650
You ask me, they're for knocking you
up and leaving you high and dry.

18:25.130 --> 18:28.849
Hello, lover. Long time no see.

18:33.650 --> 18:34.809
- Darla.
- Darla?

18:34.849 --> 18:36.569
- Darla?
- Who's Darla?

18:37.250 --> 18:39.279
- Angel's old flame.
- Not the one who died?

18:39.650 --> 18:43.230
No, the one that came back to life.
She's a vampire.

18:43.849 --> 18:47.180
- Do you have a chart?
- In the files. I'll get it later.

18:48.049 --> 18:51.599
- When did this happen?
- You know exactly when it happened.

18:52.250 --> 18:56.109
- Angel, did you and Darla...?
- Uh....

18:57.650 --> 19:01.650
- This is impossible.
- Tell me about it, Daddy.

19:03.049 --> 19:06.839
- You slept with her?
- Vampires can't have children. Wesley?

19:07.849 --> 19:12.309
- No, he's right. It's not possible.
- That's not what I asked.

19:13.250 --> 19:16.970
You know we can't.
I know we can't, but we did.

19:18.049 --> 19:20.609
I wonder if this is that bad thing.

19:21.650 --> 19:22.910
What did you do to me?

19:24.650 --> 19:28.509
- Stop that.
- It's okay. It's all right, Cordy.

19:29.450 --> 19:32.930
You'll hurt her.
Haven't you done enough?

19:33.049 --> 19:36.170
Here, sit down.
You should get off your feet.

19:39.049 --> 19:42.980
- Can we get her some water?
- That's Darla, you don't want to--

19:43.849 --> 19:45.220
Did you or did you not?

19:45.650 --> 19:49.339
Look me in the eye and say
you'd never do a thing like this.

19:50.450 --> 19:52.549
He lied? What a surprise.

19:52.849 --> 19:57.769
Hi, I'm Fred. Is water okay,
or did you want some blood?

20:02.450 --> 20:07.329
Cordy, I'm sorry I lied. It was just--
It was a very dark time.

20:08.450 --> 20:12.170
You used her to make you feel better
during your dark time?

20:13.250 --> 20:15.779
Well, that makes it all heroic.

20:16.250 --> 20:19.829
It wasn't like that. It just happened.

20:20.450 --> 20:24.029
- I wasn't like I went evil, I just--
- You just went male.

20:24.650 --> 20:26.720
Have you been to a doctor?

20:27.650 --> 20:31.930
No, but I've been to every shaman
and seer in the Western Hemisphere.

20:33.049 --> 20:36.240
- What did they say?
- They don't know what it is.

20:36.650 --> 20:40.829
- It's never happened.
- Maybe it's an hysterical pregnancy.

20:42.049 --> 20:44.720
- Wanna to feel it kick?
- Does it kick a lot?

20:45.049 --> 20:48.529
- Like crazy.
- Wouldn't that be the first sign of...

20:50.450 --> 20:52.170
...hysteria?

20:54.049 --> 20:55.660
What can we do for you?

20:56.450 --> 20:59.960
You can get your little gang
of supernatural detectives...

21:00.650 --> 21:03.980
...to find out what's happening to me
and how to stop it.

21:04.250 --> 21:06.950
Are you gonna take some
responsibility here?

21:07.849 --> 21:09.920
- Angel?
- Oh, me?

21:11.450 --> 21:13.660
Of course I am.

21:14.450 --> 21:16.839
- Wes, let's get on this.
- What do you suggest?

21:17.450 --> 21:20.289
Use your books and find out
what's going on.

21:21.049 --> 21:23.470
Do I have to think of everything?

21:25.250 --> 21:26.410
Here it is.

21:29.450 --> 21:32.779
It says, "I have absolutely
no idea what's going on."

21:34.250 --> 21:35.759
We should talk to the Host.

21:37.049 --> 21:41.690
This is all wrong.

21:42.450 --> 21:47.680
Violence restrained
This place a sanctuary was

21:48.450 --> 21:50.869
- And shall be again
- That's great, girls.

21:51.450 --> 21:54.400
Why are you charging me 1200
over the estimate?

21:55.049 --> 21:59.190
I had to run a separate 212,
double insulation everywhere.

22:00.450 --> 22:02.869
Plus, we had a run on vendrig lines.

22:03.450 --> 22:07.240
And you said, "This club's my baby.
I want top-drawer throughout. "

22:08.250 --> 22:10.420
Lorne, you here?

22:15.450 --> 22:18.470
You gotta help me. We got kind
of a situation on our hands.

22:19.049 --> 22:23.759
- Mmm.... Angel.
- Three more of Angel's chippies.

22:24.450 --> 22:28.069
- You girls are on the pill, I hope.
- Mmm....

22:28.650 --> 22:31.910
- Why are they here?
- They're recasting sanctuary spells...

22:32.849 --> 22:36.150
...to prevent violence.
I'm covering demons and humans.

22:37.049 --> 22:40.980
I'm opening the club again.
I was pretty blue for a long time.

22:41.250 --> 22:45.390
If it had gone on much longer,
I would have turned aquamarine.

22:47.849 --> 22:50.690
- Now, what happened here?
- What's it look like?

22:50.849 --> 22:54.539
- Angel boned her.
- Just once. Just the one night.

22:55.650 --> 22:58.319
Just the two or three times
that one night.

22:59.250 --> 23:01.210
- Is Angel gonna sing?
- Oh.

23:01.650 --> 23:03.900
- I suppose he has to.
- She's carrying the baby.

23:08.849 --> 23:12.890
- What the hell's inside me?
- We're way beyond singing, mes enfants,

23:13.650 --> 23:16.630
This is a brand-new day.
Everybody, that's a wrap.

23:17.250 --> 23:20.970
We'll finish the spell tomorrow.
We got a crisis brewing.

23:22.049 --> 23:25.380
Thanks for coming.
Check's in the mail. Get the hell out.

23:25.650 --> 23:27.190
- Bye, Angel.
- Come see--

23:28.049 --> 23:29.730
Us soon.

23:29.849 --> 23:31.460
Mmm....

23:31.650 --> 23:35.059
- Men.
- This is way beyond my Ken.

23:35.849 --> 23:39.180
And my Barbie and all my action
figures. If it's alive--

23:40.049 --> 23:42.329
It's alive. And kicking.

23:43.049 --> 23:45.750
It could be anything.
A child born to vampires?

23:46.049 --> 23:50.160
- Maybe it's some kind of über-vamp,
- The prophecies mention a Tro-Clon.

23:50.849 --> 23:55.240
- It's supposed to be here about now.
- Born of darkness to bring darkness.

23:56.250 --> 24:00.039
Great, so we're saying that my child
is the scourge of mankind?

24:02.250 --> 24:04.950
You guys are upsetting her.

24:05.849 --> 24:08.519
- I think she needs to lie down.
- She can have my bedroom.

24:08.849 --> 24:09.900
Okay.

24:13.049 --> 24:15.470
We can handle it.

24:22.650 --> 24:28.269
- I think we should call a doctor.
- It'll pass. I just have to let it.

24:33.450 --> 24:34.779
I'll stay with her.

24:35.849 --> 24:38.799
- If you need anything, just holler.
- Okay.

24:44.250 --> 24:48.599
I don't accept this. These prophecies
can be interpreted a hundred ways.

24:49.650 --> 24:52.910
- Are your calculations right?
- I'm still working on them.

24:53.849 --> 24:57.150
- What we do know is Darla's pregnant.
- It's impossible.

24:57.450 --> 25:00.859
And mystically unfair.
You fought long and hard for good.

25:01.650 --> 25:03.900
For you to spawn something evil....

25:04.650 --> 25:07.950
Nothing spawned by Darla and me
can be good.

25:08.849 --> 25:13.029
The prophecy about Angel being pivotal
in the battle of good and evil.

25:13.650 --> 25:15.819
- That shanshu one?
- Maybe it's not you.

25:16.650 --> 25:18.329
Maybe your child is pivotal.

25:19.049 --> 25:22.029
Maybe your destiny is to help
bring it to the world.

25:22.650 --> 25:23.839
Or to stop it.

25:25.650 --> 25:28.769
Can I say something about destiny?

25:29.849 --> 25:34.730
Screw destiny. If this evil thing
comes, we'll fight it and whup it.

25:35.250 --> 25:38.440
Destiny just means inevitable.
And nothing's inevitable...

25:39.450 --> 25:43.730
...if you stand up, look it in the eye
and say, "You're evitable. "

25:46.049 --> 25:49.170
- Well, you catch my drift.
- I like her so much.

25:50.250 --> 25:53.619
I want to see these prophecies
and anything else we've got.

25:53.849 --> 25:55.599
Why don't I go get everything?

25:56.250 --> 25:59.480
Good idea. We'll figure out
how to fight this thing.

26:00.450 --> 26:02.170
- How's she doing?
- She's weary.

26:02.250 --> 26:06.430
Poor thing looks about 18 months
pregnant. Hope they're not twins.

26:07.650 --> 26:12.670
- Not her, Cordelia.
- I sense she's hurt and pissed.

26:13.049 --> 26:15.119
What, with the lying and deception.

26:16.049 --> 26:18.329
You should probably stay
out of her way.

26:19.170 --> 26:23.420
- How are you feeling?
- Just crazy.

26:24.569 --> 26:26.009
What?

26:26.369 --> 26:29.740
Why would anyone bring something
into this world?

26:31.769 --> 26:36.970
I was pregnant once.
I was out to here overnight.

26:38.369 --> 26:40.119
Mystical thing.

26:40.170 --> 26:44.559
I didn't go to term, but while
it lasted, talk about uncomfortable.

26:45.569 --> 26:49.539
Your back and legs hurt. You're sick
to your stomach and can't eat.

26:50.369 --> 26:52.579
And then you're ravenous.

26:53.970 --> 26:56.920
Are you able to eat, or do you just--?

26:58.769 --> 27:01.400
What? Drink?

27:02.970 --> 27:06.799
Well, that's really none
of my business, is it?

27:08.970 --> 27:12.480
You should rest and I should....

27:14.970 --> 27:16.930
I'll just be real close by.

27:17.970 --> 27:19.829
If there's anything you need--

27:22.170 --> 27:24.839
I'm hungry all the time. It's weird.

27:25.769 --> 27:29.980
Sure. You're eating for two now.
It's only natural.

27:30.569 --> 27:35.980
No. What's weird is,
no matter how much I feed...

27:37.170 --> 27:38.750
...I can't seem to get full.

27:42.569 --> 27:45.730
Pregnant or not,
you're going to keep your distance.

28:11.369 --> 28:12.880
Get away from her!

28:14.970 --> 28:16.720
You're gonna be all right.

28:16.769 --> 28:21.299
You're gonna be all right. Here.

28:22.170 --> 28:24.240
I'll kill her for this.

28:25.170 --> 28:28.009
You're gonna have to find her first.

28:29.970 --> 28:32.039
- She bit Cordy.
- Are you all right?

28:32.369 --> 28:33.420
Where is she?

28:34.170 --> 28:38.740
- We hit her fists with our faces but--
- We'll get Cordy to a safe place.

28:44.809 --> 28:49.519
- Are you feeling any better?
- Yeah. You don't have to stay with me.

28:51.410 --> 28:53.440
Gunn's gonna be right here.

28:54.410 --> 28:56.440
Thanks.

29:00.410 --> 29:03.670
I'm not gonna keep telling you
how sorry I am.

29:05.210 --> 29:08.690
I'm going to tell you
she'll never do it again.

29:10.009 --> 29:14.960
It was my fault, Angel.
I felt sorry for her.

29:16.009 --> 29:19.630
She looked so helpless, like a mother.

29:21.410 --> 29:23.549
I forgot what she really was.

29:26.809 --> 29:29.720
I'm starting to feel the pills.

29:46.009 --> 29:49.730
- You see Darla anywhere in range--
- I'll take care of it.

29:51.410 --> 29:53.160
Wait.

29:54.410 --> 29:56.549
When she bit me, I had a vision.

29:59.210 --> 30:02.440
- What'd you see?
- It was like no vision I've ever had.

30:03.410 --> 30:07.690
She's so hungry. She doesn't know
how to make the hunger stop.

30:11.210 --> 30:13.069
I think I know where she's headed.

30:13.609 --> 30:16.730
I know you won't listen,
but don't do this alone.

30:17.809 --> 30:21.359
- I have to do this alone.
- A normal vampire is strong.

30:22.009 --> 30:24.819
Darla took us all down
without breaking stride.

30:25.609 --> 30:27.819
She's stronger because
of what's in her.

30:28.009 --> 30:29.339
I know. I put it there.

30:31.009 --> 30:33.329
Why does he have to do
everything alone?

30:34.009 --> 30:36.609
He just can't bear
to have us see him do it.

30:37.009 --> 30:41.190
Kill Darla? She did try to kill Cordy,
and she's a vampire.

30:42.410 --> 30:46.130
Who's carrying his child.
The one thing he can never have...

30:46.609 --> 30:48.259
...even if he lives forever.

31:02.210 --> 31:04.279
Mommy?

31:09.410 --> 31:10.920
Mommy?

31:11.809 --> 31:14.970
- Mommy?
- What's wrong, honey?

31:15.410 --> 31:16.779
Lost your mommy?

31:19.009 --> 31:21.539
Let's go find her together.

31:22.609 --> 31:24.569
You're a brave woman.

31:25.609 --> 31:27.079
About to have one.

31:28.609 --> 31:31.000
Taking the other one out to play.

31:31.609 --> 31:36.140
I love children.
I could just eat them up.

31:56.849 --> 32:01.630
It's all right. It's just a dream.
She can't hurt you.

32:02.250 --> 32:04.990
I have to talk to Wes.

32:06.450 --> 32:08.839
It was a dream,
but it was like a vision.

32:09.450 --> 32:12.500
- About what?
- About what's inside Darla.

32:14.849 --> 32:20.259
This Tro-Clon thing, the prophecies
say that it will be born...

32:20.849 --> 32:22.710
...or it will arise?

32:23.250 --> 32:28.480
The Middle English, arezan, and the
Gothic, urazan, both mean "to appear. "

32:29.849 --> 32:32.900
Angel's not answering.
Should I leave a message?

32:33.450 --> 32:35.410
Just try his pager.

32:35.849 --> 32:38.309
There's a reference
to it being burren...

32:38.849 --> 32:40.430
...which is Middle English
for "to be born. "

32:48.450 --> 32:51.049
Well, we found Angel's beeper.

32:52.049 --> 32:55.309
What is it?
What is the vision trying to tell you?

32:56.250 --> 33:00.710
I think they're trying to tell me
why Darla is craving younger victims.

33:03.849 --> 33:06.059
I don't think my mom is back here.

33:06.849 --> 33:09.410
Are you sure? Did you look?

33:14.650 --> 33:16.160
I don't see anybody.

33:23.650 --> 33:25.720
There you are. Where have you been?

33:26.049 --> 33:28.009
I told you not to wander off.

33:36.849 --> 33:39.170
You so wanna play the good guy.

33:39.250 --> 33:43.500
Yeah, you're the good guy,
who did this to me.

33:44.650 --> 33:47.559
You have the face,
but you don't know the hunger.

33:48.250 --> 33:50.319
It pounds. It won't go away.

33:51.250 --> 33:53.779
- You can't stop it!
- I'll stop it!

34:10.449 --> 34:13.469
How could you put this in me?
I hate you!

34:17.650 --> 34:20.559
They breathe. They breathe and pound.

34:20.650 --> 34:23.949
I don't breathe, you idiot!
You can't strangle me!

34:24.849 --> 34:26.289
I'm not gonna strangle you.

34:27.849 --> 34:30.309
Go on, do it.

34:32.050 --> 34:33.659
Do it.

34:41.650 --> 34:45.969
- Do it, do it! It won't stop!
- No, it won't.

34:48.250 --> 34:51.199
- Darla, listen, it has a soul.
- What?

34:51.849 --> 34:55.710
- It has a heartbeat, it has a soul.
- Not my child!

34:56.050 --> 34:59.599
Our child. That's why you've
been craving pure blood.

35:00.250 --> 35:02.320
That's why! It has a soul.

35:03.250 --> 35:05.250
- No, it doesn't.
- It does.

35:05.650 --> 35:08.210
- It can't.
- Yes, it does.

35:14.250 --> 35:16.320
Drink this.

35:20.849 --> 35:23.480
- Pig's blood?
- You'll get used to--

35:28.650 --> 35:32.269
You're not alone in this.
We'll deal with this together.

35:32.849 --> 35:36.360
Gosh, I'm the luckiest vampire girl
in the whole world.

35:38.250 --> 35:42.570
- Get away from me.
- Try and get some sleep.

35:44.250 --> 35:47.269
How's Cordy?
She wanna come up and visit?

35:49.650 --> 35:52.110
- If she goes near Cordy or Fred--
- I know.

35:52.650 --> 35:56.969
Don't underestimate her. She's
stronger than all of us right now.

36:05.849 --> 36:09.710
Don't go near Darla without me,
Gunn and a lot of crossbows.

36:10.650 --> 36:13.280
- You understand?
- Yeah. And if I forget...

36:13.650 --> 36:16.909
- ...I have a nice reminder.
- That goes for you too, Fred.

36:17.849 --> 36:19.739
Got you.

36:21.449 --> 36:25.699
I guess you're gonna be a father.

36:28.050 --> 36:31.489
- Guess I am.
- I felt it in my dream.

36:32.250 --> 36:36.460
The same thing you did
when you found her.

36:37.050 --> 36:41.440
- It has a soul.
- Angel has a soul. It makes sense.

36:42.449 --> 36:45.010
As much as any of this does.

36:49.050 --> 36:50.659
Angel, even with a soul...

36:50.849 --> 36:53.940
...she could give birth
to what's in the prophecies.

36:55.050 --> 36:57.650
The thing that's come
to kill and burn us all?

36:58.050 --> 37:02.050
I know that.
I also know that child is mine.

37:05.250 --> 37:06.760
- Right.
- Well.

37:07.050 --> 37:10.239
Another big fun day
at Angel Investigations.

37:11.250 --> 37:14.510
- Let's pour ourselves a good, stiff--
- Uh-oh.

37:14.849 --> 37:17.409
A good, stiff uh-oh?

37:18.449 --> 37:22.869
Remember when I said I thought I might
be off on my earlier calculations?

37:23.849 --> 37:27.539
And Wes said the Tro-Clon
would "arise" or "be born" or both.

37:28.650 --> 37:33.710
And arepare is Latin for "arrive"
or "come to," as from a deep sleep.

37:34.650 --> 37:35.840
- Fred!
- Right.

37:35.849 --> 37:39.820
I believe that whatever this thing is,
it's arriving about...

37:40.650 --> 37:43.179
...three, two, now.

38:12.210 --> 38:16.530
The weight of time is heavy on the
world, and all men born must die.

38:17.610 --> 38:21.510
But there are worlds where dreamers
dream and sleepers sleep...

38:22.409 --> 38:23.989
...and patiently await.

38:26.010 --> 38:29.340
As pledged in Kaladan by Kadshi...

38:30.210 --> 38:34.809
...one shall awaken in the first year
of the final century.

38:36.210 --> 38:40.460
That one who lived before
and joined Kadshi in the great sleep.

38:41.610 --> 38:46.250
Arise, as was promised and foretold.
Arise.

38:48.809 --> 38:50.489
Arise!

39:41.010 --> 39:44.269
Welcome to the 21st century.

39:45.210 --> 39:48.469
Angelus is here. You'll see him soon.

39:49.409 --> 39:51.730
You haven't used your muscles
in a long time.

39:52.409 --> 39:55.670
It will be a while before you're
strong enough to--

39:56.010 --> 39:58.820
Just tell me where he is.

39:59.305 --> 40:05.198
