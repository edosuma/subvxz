WEBVTT

00:01.436 --> 00:02.698
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...

00:02.741 --> 00:04.352
IT'S COMING!

00:04.395 --> 00:05.962
THE TIME BETWEEN HERE
AND SANCTUM DOESN'T SQUARE UP.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.311
THE GOOD NEWS IS YOU CAN
BE HERE FOR YEARS,

00:07.355 --> 00:08.921
AND NO ONE WOULD MISS YOU.

00:08.965 --> 00:11.620
DIYOZA: OCTAVIA, YOU FOOL!
THERE IS NO HOPE!

00:11.663 --> 00:13.013
-ON YOUR FEET. MOVE.
-LET'S GO.

00:13.056 --> 00:14.623
HOPE: MOM! OCTAVIA!

00:14.666 --> 00:16.233
ECHO: YOU WERE HERE
FOR 6 YEARS?

00:16.277 --> 00:18.670
HOPE: I WAS HERE
FOR 20 YEARS.

00:18.714 --> 00:20.803
DID YOU KNOW
THEY WERE TAKING
BELLAMY, TOO?

00:20.846 --> 00:22.979
WHAT IS IT
ABOUT BELLAMY
THAT HAS

00:23.023 --> 00:24.850
OTHERWISE SENSIBLE WOMEN
WILLING TO DIE FOR HIM?

00:24.894 --> 00:27.331
I MADE A DEAL
TO SAVE MY MOTHER.

00:27.375 --> 00:29.290
THE PLAN WAS FOR ME
TO JUMP BACK IN

00:29.333 --> 00:30.856
AND KILL ANYONE
WHO GOT IN MY WAY.

00:49.310 --> 00:52.661
DIYOZA: OCTAVIA,
DON'T TELL THEM ANYTHING!

00:55.490 --> 00:56.839
IT'S BEEN RECHARGED.

01:00.973 --> 01:03.237
SHE'S CLEAN.
TRANSFER TO M-CAP.

01:03.280 --> 01:04.542
YES, SIR.

01:04.586 --> 01:06.153
UH! UGH.

01:10.461 --> 01:11.984
ERR! AGH!

01:18.991 --> 01:20.776
MAN: I TOLD YOU
THIS ONE WAS STUBBORN.

01:22.647 --> 01:24.736
GET HER!

01:24.780 --> 01:26.564
MAN, ON P.A.:
SECURITY BREACH.

01:26.608 --> 01:28.653
ALL NONESSENTIAL PERSONNEL,
RETURN TO LIFTS STAT.

01:31.003 --> 01:33.267
ALL SECURITY PERSONNEL,
REPORT.

01:33.310 --> 01:35.182
I REPEAT,
SUBJECT IS ON THE RUN.

01:35.225 --> 01:37.184
APPREHEND AT ALL COSTS.

01:37.227 --> 01:38.489
MAN: WE HAVE A VISUAL
ON LEVEL 3.

01:48.891 --> 01:50.545
UH!

01:52.373 --> 01:54.114
MAN, ON RECORDING: WE ARE
BLESSED TO LIVE IN AN AGE

01:54.157 --> 01:57.160
WHERE WE HAVE CONQUERED
OUR LESSER EMOTIONS.

01:57.204 --> 01:59.510
DEVOTION TO THE GREAT BATTLE
THAT IS TO COME...

01:59.554 --> 02:02.078
HOW THE HELL DO I
GET OUT OF HERE?

02:02.122 --> 02:04.254
COMPUTER VOICE: LEVEL TWO.
ARBORETUM LEVEL.

02:14.917 --> 02:17.746
MAN: LEVEL TWO, SQUAD A.
WE HAVE A VISUAL CONTACT.

02:37.635 --> 02:39.028
UH!

02:41.248 --> 02:42.466
UH!

02:46.296 --> 02:49.299
UGH.

02:49.343 --> 02:51.214
OHH.

03:01.964 --> 03:03.313
UH!

03:06.447 --> 03:07.665
UH!

03:10.320 --> 03:11.887
WELCOME TO BARDO.

03:50.360 --> 03:51.927
WHAT HAPPENED?

03:51.970 --> 03:54.582
-IT'S THE FAITHFUL.
-EXCUSE ME?

03:54.625 --> 03:56.061
WHAT THE FOOLS
WHO STILL BELIEVE

03:56.105 --> 03:57.628
ARE CALLING
THEMSELVES NOW.

03:57.672 --> 03:59.935
THEY BARRICADED THEMSELVES
INSIDE OUR TAVERN

03:59.978 --> 04:02.503
AND ARE DEMANDING
TO SPEAK TO CLARKE.

04:02.546 --> 04:04.809
WE ALREADY SPARED
RUSSELL'S LIFE.

04:04.853 --> 04:06.463
WHAT DO THEY WANT NOW?

04:06.507 --> 04:08.117
NELSON: INDRA, WE NEED
TO TALK ABOUT RUSSELL.

04:08.160 --> 04:10.424
GET SOME SLEEP, NELSON.
IT'S LATE.

04:10.467 --> 04:12.077
RUSSELL DIES,
AND I DON'T EXPOSE

04:12.121 --> 04:13.296
KAYLEE AND DANIEL.

04:13.340 --> 04:14.906
THAT WAS OUR DEAL.

04:14.950 --> 04:16.821
LETTING RUSSELL LIVE
IS HOW WE KEEP THE PEACE.

04:16.865 --> 04:20.477
KEEPING OUR DEAL
IS, TOO.

04:20.521 --> 04:24.176
ARE YOU
THREATENING ME?

04:24.220 --> 04:27.092
IF I WAS, WHAT COULD
YOU DO ABOUT IT

04:27.136 --> 04:30.270
WITHOUT AN ARMY?

04:30.313 --> 04:34.361
WOMAN: BLESSED
BE THE PRIMES AND SANCTUM.

04:34.404 --> 04:36.101
GLORY AND PRAISE TO THE PRIMES.

04:36.145 --> 04:37.451
HOLY ARE THEY...

04:37.494 --> 04:40.671
THIS SHOULD BE GOOD.

04:40.715 --> 04:43.326
-I ASKED FOR CLARKE.
-YOU GOT ME.

04:43.370 --> 04:46.242
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

04:46.286 --> 04:47.939
ON BEHALF OF THE FAITHFUL,

04:47.983 --> 04:50.377
I DEMAND THE RELEASE
OF RUSSELL PRIME.

04:50.420 --> 04:52.988
WE ALREADY SPARED
HIS LIFE TODAY.

04:53.031 --> 04:54.903
THAT'S AS FAR AS
WE'RE WILLING TO GO.

04:54.946 --> 04:57.819
AS YOU KNOW, HE ORDERED
YOU TO STAND DOWN.

04:57.862 --> 04:59.255
THAT WAS
BEFORE HE WAS SHOT.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.344
-YES, BY ONE OF YOURS.
-NOT OURS.

05:01.388 --> 05:03.259
WE ARE THE KEEPERS
OF THE LIGHT.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.522
RUSSELL PRIME IS
A BEING OF DIVINE LOVE,

05:05.566 --> 05:07.437
YET YOU KEEP HIM
IN CHAINS

05:07.481 --> 05:10.527
LIKE ONE OF THE PRISONERS
YOU POLLUTE OUR HOME WITH.

05:15.532 --> 05:18.274
ALL ANY OF US WANTS
IS PEACE.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.797
RUSSELL WANTS
THAT, TOO.

05:19.841 --> 05:22.104
WE HAD PEACE
BEFORE YOU ARRIVED,

05:22.147 --> 05:23.845
AND WE WON'T REST
UNTIL WE GET BACK

05:23.888 --> 05:25.629
EVERYTHING YOU'VE
STOLEN FROM US.

05:25.673 --> 05:27.544
SO YOU DEFY
THE WILL OF YOUR GOD?

05:27.588 --> 05:30.808
NO. WE OBEY.

05:30.852 --> 05:33.811
WE WON'T TAKE UP ARMS
AGAINST OUR ENEMIES,

05:33.855 --> 05:37.032
BUT WE WILL SACRIFICE
OUR LIVES FOR HIS

05:37.075 --> 05:40.470
ONE BY ONE EVERY HOUR
UNTIL HIS RELEASE.

05:40.514 --> 05:42.516
TREY, DON'T BE A FOOL.

05:42.559 --> 05:44.909
WILL YOU RELEASE
RUSSELL PRIME?

05:49.218 --> 05:52.613
I TOLD YOU, THAT'S
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

05:54.615 --> 05:58.706
FOR THE GLORY
AND THE GRACE OF THE PRIMES.

06:03.101 --> 06:04.668
OUT OF THE WAY!
MOVE!

06:06.148 --> 06:08.368
MOVE! GET OFF!

06:20.423 --> 06:22.425
ONE PER HOUR.
YOU TRY TO TAKE
THE TAVERN,

06:22.469 --> 06:24.079
AND WE ALL DIE
AT ONCE.

06:36.308 --> 06:37.875
RACK UP ANOTHER ONE
FOR FAITH.

06:37.919 --> 06:39.442
FAITH ISN'T
THE PROBLEM.

06:39.486 --> 06:42.184
BLIND FAITH IS.

06:42.227 --> 06:43.838
JACKSON: LET ME
SEE THOSE HANDS.

06:43.881 --> 06:46.144
INDRA: THAT WAS
A BRAVE THING
YOU DID, NELSON.

06:46.188 --> 06:48.059
THEY MAY HATE US,

06:48.103 --> 06:51.019
BUT THEY'RE STILL
OUR PEOPLE.

06:51.062 --> 06:53.500
EVEN THOUGH YOU
WERE CAST OUT?

06:53.543 --> 06:55.197
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
KAYLEE PRIME?

06:55.240 --> 06:56.938
YOU FORGET WE ARE ONE?

06:56.981 --> 06:58.809
EASY, BIG BUY.
IF NOT FOR HER,

06:58.853 --> 07:01.595
WE'D ALL LOOK LIKE
THAT GIRL YOU DIDN'T
SAVE RIGHT NOW.

07:01.638 --> 07:03.118
MINOR BURNS.
LET ME CLEAN THEM UP

07:03.161 --> 07:05.033
AND GET YOU SOMETHING
FOR THE PAIN.

07:07.688 --> 07:11.953
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO KNOW
THEY'RE WILLING TO DIE
FOR YOUR FREEDOM?

07:11.996 --> 07:14.085
RUSSELL: AWFUL.
NELSON: LIAR.

07:14.129 --> 07:15.522
YOU PUT THEM
UP TO THIS.

07:15.565 --> 07:17.915
WHY WOULD I TELL
MY FOLLOWERS

07:17.959 --> 07:19.961
TO KILL THEMSELVES

07:20.004 --> 07:22.006
WHEN THEY'RE
THE ONLY THING
PREVENTING YOU

07:22.050 --> 07:23.617
FROM KILLING ME?

07:23.660 --> 07:25.314
MURPHY: IN THAT CASE,
MAYBE WE LET THEM.

07:29.840 --> 07:32.060
WHAT? AM I THE ONLY ONE
WHO SEES THIS

07:32.103 --> 07:34.062
AS A SOLUTION
AND NOT A PROBLEM?

07:34.105 --> 07:36.020
IF THE FAITHFUL ARE
THE ONLY REASON
WE'RE KEEPING

07:36.064 --> 07:39.850
THIS SON OF A BITCH ALIVE,
THEN I SAY WE LIVE
AND LET DIE.

07:39.894 --> 07:41.461
OR YOU COULD
FREE ME.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.684
FINE THEN.
SEND ME IN.

07:47.728 --> 07:49.860
I'LL TALK THEM
DOWN...AGAIN.

07:49.904 --> 07:53.516
INDRA: NO. FROM NOW ON,
WE DICTATE TERMS.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.300
JACKSON: INDRA,
WE CAN'T JUST LET THEM

07:55.344 --> 07:56.737
BURN THEMSELVES ALIVE.

07:56.780 --> 07:58.608
WE WON'T. RUSSELL
ISN'T THE ONLY PRIME

07:58.652 --> 08:00.175
IN SANCTUM.

08:00.218 --> 08:01.829
EMORI: I'M IN.
I'LL DO IT. I'LL DO IT.

08:01.872 --> 08:03.744
EMORI, EMORI,
YOU CAN BARELY WALK.

08:03.787 --> 08:05.267
I'M FINE. I'M OK.

08:05.310 --> 08:08.183
SIT...PLEASE.

08:11.534 --> 08:13.754
GREAT DOCTORING.
YOU SAID SHE WAS FINE.

08:13.797 --> 08:15.712
JACKSON: SHE WILL BE.
RECOVERY FROM RADIATION EXPOSURE

08:15.756 --> 08:17.714
DOESN'T ALWAYS PROGRESS
IN A STRAIGHT LINE.

08:17.758 --> 08:19.803
INDRA: AND MURPHY--
HOW IS HE?

08:19.847 --> 08:21.283
CLEARED FOR DUTY.

08:25.156 --> 08:27.637
FINE, BUT THE OTHERS
BETTER COME BACK SOON

08:27.681 --> 08:30.597
BECAUSE I AM GETTING
TIRED OF BEING THE HERO.

08:40.128 --> 08:43.174
MAN: THIS IS
A VERY IMPORTANT ASSIGNMENT.

08:43.218 --> 08:45.002
WE NEED TO KNOW
WHERE SHE CAME FROM

08:45.046 --> 08:48.049
AND HOW SHE GOT THERE,
AND WE NEED TO KNOW IT FAST.

08:51.008 --> 08:53.402
DIFFERENT MAN:
HELLO, OCTAVIA.

08:53.445 --> 08:57.406
I'M GONNA START BY ASKING YOU
A FEW BASELINE QUESTIONS.

08:57.449 --> 08:59.060
WHO ARE YOU?

09:03.543 --> 09:05.675
MR. LEVITT ASKED
YOU A QUESTION.

09:08.199 --> 09:09.723
WHO ARE YOU?

09:09.766 --> 09:11.551
NONE OF YOUR
DAMN BUSINESS.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.469
OCTAVIA, PLEASE
DON'T STRUGGLE.

09:17.513 --> 09:19.907
MEMORY CAPTURE
USES A LASER-GUIDED
NEURAL INTERFACE.

09:19.950 --> 09:22.562
IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL,
IT COULD LOBOTOMIZE YOU.

09:25.086 --> 09:28.611
SHE DOESN'T EVEN
UNDERSTAND WHAT
THAT MEANS.

09:28.655 --> 09:31.092
-GET ON WITH IT.
-SIR, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

09:31.135 --> 09:32.702
WE DO THINGS
A CERTAIN WAY.

09:32.746 --> 09:34.965
WELL, THIS IS ROUTINE
THEN, IS THAT IT,

09:35.009 --> 09:38.142
JUST ANOTHER
STANDARD DISCIPLE
PSYCH EVALUATION?

09:38.186 --> 09:40.405
WE FOUND TWO
SEEMINGLY HUMAN,

09:40.449 --> 09:43.583
CLEARLY DANGEROUS
INDIVIDUALS LIVING
ON OUR PRISON PLANET.

09:43.626 --> 09:45.367
HOW DID THEY GET THERE?

09:45.410 --> 09:47.587
HOW MANY MORE
OF THEM ARE THERE?

09:47.630 --> 09:51.199
WHAT DO THEY KNOW
ABOUT THE STONES?

09:51.242 --> 09:52.809
ASK.

10:00.861 --> 10:02.384
OCTAVIA:
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:11.698 --> 10:12.916
LEVITT: THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE AFRAID OF

10:12.960 --> 10:14.570
AS LONG AS YOU
COOPERATE.

10:18.139 --> 10:20.402
LET'S TRY THIS PATH.

10:20.445 --> 10:21.925
YOU'RE IN
AN ENDLESS DESERT

10:21.969 --> 10:24.145
WITH A VAST
PURPLE SKY.

10:24.188 --> 10:26.843
A HAND REACHES OUT
FOR YOUR OWN.

10:26.887 --> 10:28.453
WHOSE IS IT?

10:33.633 --> 10:35.635
OCTAVIA'S VOICE:
BELLAMY!

10:35.678 --> 10:37.419
GOOD.

10:37.462 --> 10:38.942
THE NEURAL LINK
IS ENGAGED.

10:38.986 --> 10:41.118
GO FLOAT YOURSELF.

10:41.162 --> 10:42.337
SHOW ME.

10:43.730 --> 10:45.470
HOLOGRAM MODE.

10:51.302 --> 10:53.348
OCTAVIA, WHO
IS BELLAMY?

10:53.391 --> 10:55.045
I'M NOT GIVING YOU
ANYTHING.

10:55.089 --> 10:56.612
DIAL UP THE FREQUENCY.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.353
-SIR, THAT COULD DAMAGE--
-DO IT.

11:09.625 --> 11:11.453
OCTAVIA: SKAIKRU
WASN'T THE ONLY CLAN

11:11.496 --> 11:13.585
THAT SHOWED DISHONOR
AT THE CONCLAVE.

11:13.629 --> 11:15.065
IF A.L.I.E.
CAN FIND US...

11:15.109 --> 11:16.501
BELLAMY: ARE YOU
OUT OF YOUR MIND?

11:16.545 --> 11:18.939
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO KILL ANYONE!

11:18.982 --> 11:20.027
I'LL KILL YOU.

11:20.070 --> 11:22.856
GET OUT OF MY HEAD!

11:42.832 --> 11:44.747
-TOUGH CROWD.
-WE DON'T NEED AN ARMY.

11:44.791 --> 11:46.488
WE NEED YOU TO DO
YOUR JOB.

11:46.531 --> 11:48.664
YEAH, BUT GODS
LOVE ARMIES.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.797
LISTEN. CAN WE
AT LEAST ASK
IF THEY'LL HELP?

11:50.840 --> 11:52.842
RELAX. YOU'RE NOT
GOING INSIDE.

11:52.886 --> 11:55.889
ANYONE MAKES A MOVE,
I'LL SHOOT THEM MYSELF.

12:15.952 --> 12:17.649
I GOT IT.

12:40.020 --> 12:43.110
DANIEL PRIME.

12:43.153 --> 12:46.461
UH, COME IN, PLEASE.

12:46.504 --> 12:50.508
SELF-IMMOLATION, TREY?
REALLY?

12:50.552 --> 12:52.946
DON'T YOU THINK
THAT'S A TAD EXCESSIVE?

12:55.905 --> 12:57.820
A KID?

12:57.864 --> 13:00.214
ARE YOU OUT
OF YOUR MIND?

13:00.257 --> 13:02.216
GET OUT OF MY WAY!

13:08.570 --> 13:10.267
MOVE. STEP AWAY
FROM THE BOY!

13:21.583 --> 13:24.934
IS THIS YOUR KID?

13:24.978 --> 13:26.588
AND YOU WANT HIM
TO DIE?

13:30.461 --> 13:32.550
NO, SIR.

13:32.594 --> 13:35.466
OF COURSE, IF IT SERVES
THE GLORY AND THE GRACE
OF THE PRIMES--

13:35.510 --> 13:37.338
IT DOESN'T.

13:42.169 --> 13:43.866
GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

13:45.999 --> 13:49.611
THE REST OF THE CHILDREN,
COME WITH ME.

13:49.654 --> 13:51.918
NOW.

13:51.961 --> 13:54.311
YOU SHOULD ALL BE
ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES.

13:54.355 --> 13:55.704
COME ON.

13:58.228 --> 13:59.882
OPEN THE DOOR.

14:05.670 --> 14:08.717
SO WE MEET AGAIN.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.675
BET YOU'RE WONDERING
WHY I NEVER CALLED.

14:10.719 --> 14:13.809
TREY: ZEV, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

14:13.853 --> 14:18.031
NAME THE 4 PILLARS
OF SANCTUM.

14:18.074 --> 14:20.903
HOW DARE YOU TRY
TO TEST ME?

14:20.947 --> 14:21.948
HE DOESN'T KNOW.

14:21.991 --> 14:25.429
OF COURSE I DO.

14:25.473 --> 14:26.909
REPENT.

14:29.433 --> 14:30.652
RENEW.

14:31.958 --> 14:33.481
RESTORE.

14:34.961 --> 14:37.006
REBIRTH.

14:37.050 --> 14:39.791
THANK YOU, TREY.

14:39.835 --> 14:41.750
NOW OPEN THE DOOR--OOF!

14:47.974 --> 14:52.369
TREY: PILLAR 3
IS REJOICE, NOT RESTORE,

14:52.413 --> 14:56.373
AND WE WILL WHEN
WE WATCH YOU BURN.

14:59.028 --> 15:00.551
I'LL SURVIVE.

15:03.032 --> 15:05.948
LEVITT: TELL ME
ABOUT THIS JOHN MURPHY.

15:05.992 --> 15:07.994
IS HE FAMILY,

15:08.037 --> 15:09.909
FRIEND, LOVER?

15:16.480 --> 15:17.960
WE'VE BEEN AT THIS
FOR 11 DAYS.

15:18.004 --> 15:20.136
PLEASE JUST
LET ME IN.

15:20.180 --> 15:22.051
IF I DON'T GIVE
ANDERS SOMETHING SOON,

15:22.095 --> 15:23.574
THEY'LL REPLACE ME
WITH SOMEONE THAT
WILL BURN

15:23.618 --> 15:25.576
THEIR WAY RIGHT
THROUGH YOUR HEAD.

15:25.620 --> 15:27.187
I'M TRYING NOT
TO DO THAT, OK?

15:27.230 --> 15:29.232
I HOPE BY NOW
YOU CAN TRUST ME.

15:29.276 --> 15:30.755
OCTAVIA: HOPE,
GET BACK HERE.

15:30.799 --> 15:32.975
YOUNG HOPE:
COME AND GET ME!

15:36.022 --> 15:37.675
I DID IT.

15:37.719 --> 15:39.242
THAT'S PENANCE.

15:39.286 --> 15:41.027
YOUNG HOPE: I LOVE YOU.

15:41.070 --> 15:42.811
OCTAVIA, STOP.
JUST RELAX.

15:47.555 --> 15:52.212
THERE WAS A CHILD
WITH YOU.

15:52.255 --> 15:54.649
WHO IS SHE?

15:54.692 --> 15:56.390
OCTAVIA, IF SHE'S
STILL ON PENANCE--

15:56.433 --> 15:58.914
SKYRING, YOU IDIOT.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.656
WE CALL IT SKYRING.

16:01.699 --> 16:03.745
I LIKE THAT.

16:03.788 --> 16:05.703
YOU DO KNOW THAT
IN THE TIME

16:05.747 --> 16:09.055
YOU'VE BEEN HERE,

16:09.098 --> 16:10.882
YEARS HAVE PASSED
FOR HER.

16:14.234 --> 16:18.064
YOU HAVE TO
LET ME GO, PLEASE.

16:18.107 --> 16:20.936
I NEED TO GET
BACK TO HER.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.633
I'M BEGGING YOU.

16:24.026 --> 16:27.595
I HAVE MY ORDERS.

16:27.638 --> 16:28.988
I'M SORRY.

16:35.646 --> 16:38.345
I'LL COOPERATE.

16:38.388 --> 16:40.303
LEAVE HER OUT
OF YOUR REPORT

16:40.347 --> 16:41.870
AND LET ME GO
BACK TO HER,

16:41.913 --> 16:45.221
I'LL SHOW YOU
EVERYTHING.

16:45.265 --> 16:46.875
PLEASE.

16:52.576 --> 16:53.838
DEAL.

16:56.885 --> 16:58.017
THANK YOU.

17:02.543 --> 17:04.588
LET'S START AGAIN.

17:04.632 --> 17:07.548
OK, BUT YOU'RE NOT
GONNA LIKE WHAT YOU SEE.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.428
MILLER: BLODREINA
GAVE THAT HONOR TO ME.

17:18.472 --> 17:20.082
OCTAVIA:
YOU'RE DEAD TO ME!

17:20.126 --> 17:22.650
PIKE: YOU CAUSED THE WORLD
TO BE DESTROYED!

17:22.693 --> 17:23.738
REDEMPTION!

17:27.568 --> 17:28.960
THEY WON'T STOP
TILL THEY'RE OUT COLD.

17:29.004 --> 17:30.832
MILLER: COPY THAT.
GO FOR THE KNOCKOUT.

17:36.446 --> 17:37.969
IT'S OK.

17:43.105 --> 17:44.585
YES!

17:46.891 --> 17:50.678
SORRY. IT'S JUST...
YOU'RE AMAZING.

17:50.721 --> 17:54.682
I'M A KILLER,
NOTHING MORE.

17:54.725 --> 17:56.945
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

17:56.988 --> 17:58.338
WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU KNOW?

18:02.646 --> 18:05.432
I'VE JUST SPENT
3 DAYS IN YOUR HEAD.

18:05.475 --> 18:07.173
MAYBE YOU LOST
YOUR WAY SOMEWHERE,

18:07.216 --> 18:08.783
BUT YOU'VE
SACRIFICED SO MUCH

18:08.826 --> 18:10.393
FOR THE PEOPLE
YOU LOVE,

18:10.437 --> 18:12.743
EVEN AS A CHILD
FORCED TO HIDE
UNDER THE FLOOR.

18:12.787 --> 18:15.094
YOU WERE TERRIFIED, BUT
YOU NEVER MADE A SOUND

18:15.137 --> 18:17.139
BECAUSE YOU KNEW
THAT IF THEY FOUND YOU,

18:17.183 --> 18:19.750
THEY'D PUNISH BELLAMY
AND KILL YOUR MOTHER.

18:23.928 --> 18:26.105
YOU'RE NOT A KILLER,
OCTAVIA.

18:26.148 --> 18:28.281
YOU'RE A WARRIOR
TO BE SURE,

18:28.324 --> 18:31.501
BUT YOUR HEART
IS PURE.

18:31.545 --> 18:34.330
WAIT TILL YOU MEET
BLODREINA.

18:34.374 --> 18:35.853
FIRST, LET'S GET
BACK TO CLARKE

18:35.897 --> 18:37.377
AND HER JOURNEY
THAT DAY.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.816
DID SHE SURVIVE
THE CITY OF LIGHT?

18:41.859 --> 18:44.035
WHY ARE YOU SO INTERESTED
IN CLARKE?

18:46.125 --> 18:47.387
OUR TIME'S NOT
UP YET.

18:47.430 --> 18:49.432
ANDERS CAN WAIT,
AND IF NOT,

18:49.476 --> 18:51.521
HE CAN GO
FLOAT HIMSELF.

18:51.565 --> 18:56.091
DYOZA: GET HER OUT
OF THAT CHAIR NOW!

18:56.135 --> 18:57.701
DIYOZA?

18:57.745 --> 18:58.963
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
TO HER?

18:59.007 --> 19:01.531
DIYOZA, NO.
WE NEED HIM.

19:01.575 --> 19:03.490
HE'S GONNA HELP US
SAVE HOPE.

19:09.496 --> 19:11.106
OCTAVIA:
WE NEED HIM.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.810
AUNTY O...

19:23.205 --> 19:24.946
IT'S ME.

19:30.299 --> 19:31.822
HOPE.

19:34.042 --> 19:35.913
HOPE.

19:35.957 --> 19:37.480
LEVITT: YOU
SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

19:37.524 --> 19:39.178
WHERE IS MY MOTHER?

19:42.268 --> 19:43.704
TAKE US TO HER.

19:45.445 --> 19:46.794
HEY. NO, NO, NO.
NOT YOU.

19:46.837 --> 19:48.230
YOU CAN HARDLY STAND.

19:48.274 --> 19:49.927
I'M GONNA SEND YOU HOME,
AND THEN I'M

19:49.971 --> 19:51.494
GONNA GO GET MOM.

19:55.455 --> 19:57.152
THE STONE ROOM'S
ON THE WAY TO THE CELL BLOCK.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.154
IF ANYONE ASKS,
WE'RE ESCORTING THE PRISONER

19:59.198 --> 20:00.634
BACK TO HER CELL.

20:00.677 --> 20:02.331
YOU SAY ONE WORD
OTHER THAN THAT,

20:02.375 --> 20:05.508
AND I WILL CUT YOUR THROAT,
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

20:08.729 --> 20:09.947
HEH.

20:17.955 --> 20:19.609
YOU TRIGGERED
A BIOHAZARD ALERT

20:19.653 --> 20:21.045
TO KEEP PEOPLE AWAY.

20:21.089 --> 20:23.004
-CLEVER.
-WASN'T MY IDEA.

20:23.047 --> 20:24.614
SAFE TO ASSUME
THE RETRIEVAL TEAM

20:24.658 --> 20:26.312
SENT FOR WHOEVER HELPED YOU
ISN'T COMING BACK?

20:26.355 --> 20:27.835
-NO.
-THEN YOU KNOW YOU HAVE

20:27.878 --> 20:29.576
30 MINUTES UNTIL
WE SEND ANOTHER.

20:33.144 --> 20:34.929
YEP. DEV KNEW
EVERYTHING.

20:39.499 --> 20:40.978
SHOW ME THE STAR MAP.

20:41.022 --> 20:42.545
-NO.
-YOU'RE SHIVERING.

20:42.589 --> 20:44.895
HOPE: I SAID,
SHOW ME THE STAR MAP.

20:44.939 --> 20:47.289
I BELIEVE
THIS IS YOURS.

20:47.333 --> 20:49.073
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

20:49.117 --> 20:51.293
DEV SAID ALL I HAD TO DO
IS THINK IT.

20:54.035 --> 20:56.037
-SANCTUM, I PRESUME.
-YES.

20:56.080 --> 20:59.910
UNLIKE DEV, I ACTUALLY
DO KNOW EVERYTHING.

20:59.954 --> 21:01.651
I HOPE YOU WEREN'T
IN TROUBLE WHEN YOU LEFT.

21:01.695 --> 21:03.653
THANKS TO TIME DILATION,
DESPITE THE YEARS

21:03.697 --> 21:05.089
YOU SPENT ON SKYRING
AND THE LENGTH

21:05.133 --> 21:06.700
OF YOUR STAY HERE,

21:06.743 --> 21:09.529
YOU'LL BE RETURNING
AT ALMOST THE SAME TIME.

21:09.572 --> 21:12.532
SOON AS I TOUCH THIS,
THE BRIDGE WILL OPEN,
AND PEOPLE WILL KNOW.

21:12.575 --> 21:14.360
-GIVE HER YOUR HELMET.
-WHAT? WHY?

21:14.403 --> 21:17.493
SO SHE DOESN'T LOSE
HER MEMORY.

21:17.537 --> 21:19.016
IT'S A SIDE EFFECT
OF JUMPING

21:19.060 --> 21:20.583
TO A SLOWER
TIME-DILATED PLANET.

21:20.627 --> 21:22.237
SHE'LL FORGET EVERYTHING
FROM THE MOMENT SHE LEFT

21:22.281 --> 21:24.544
TO THE MOMENT SHE RETURNS.

21:24.587 --> 21:26.154
SHE'LL FORGET YOU.

21:26.197 --> 21:28.199
NO. I NEED THE HELMET
TO GHOST.

21:28.243 --> 21:31.725
WITHOUT IT,
I CAN'T GET MOM.

21:31.768 --> 21:34.205
OCTAVIA: EVEN WITH
THE HELMET, YOU COULD
STILL GET CAUGHT,

21:34.249 --> 21:36.817
AND I WON'T BE
ABLE TO HELP YOU.

21:36.860 --> 21:38.732
WAIT. I HAVE AN IDEA.

21:40.821 --> 21:42.562
THIS WAS HERE
BEFORE WE WERE.

21:42.605 --> 21:43.954
THE NATIVE BARDOANS
USED IT TO PULL PEOPLE BACK

21:43.998 --> 21:46.479
WHO GOT STUCK
IN THE BRIDGE.

21:46.522 --> 21:48.132
LET'S HOPE IT
STILL WORKS.

21:53.050 --> 21:54.835
LOOK HERE
AND TRY NOT TO BLINK.

21:54.878 --> 21:58.317
THE EYES ARE THE WINDOWS
TO THE SOUL.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.188
EVERY MIND HAS
A UNIQUE CODE.

22:00.231 --> 22:04.279
WITH IT, THE STONE
CAN FIND YOU.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.802
THAT'S YOU.

22:09.893 --> 22:11.808
YOU CAN ENTER THIS CODE
INTO THE STONE THERE.

22:11.852 --> 22:13.854
IT'LL PULL HER
ACROSS THE BRIDGE
REMOTELY.

22:13.897 --> 22:15.203
YOU WON'T REMEMBER
EACH OTHER,

22:15.246 --> 22:16.900
BUT AT LEAST
YOU'LL BE ALIVE.

22:16.944 --> 22:18.511
TURN AROUND.

22:18.554 --> 22:20.426
WE NEED TO TATTOO HER CODE
ONTO YOUR BACK.

22:20.469 --> 22:22.776
HOPE: IF YOU'RE RIGHT,
SHE WON'T REMEMBER
WHAT IT MEANS.

22:22.819 --> 22:25.648
ONE PROBLEM AT A TIME, OK?
WE HAVE TO DO THIS NOW.

22:28.042 --> 22:29.478
EASY, EASY.

22:34.875 --> 22:36.572
HOPE: WHAT IF SHE
DOESN'T SEE IT?

22:36.616 --> 22:38.618
IT'S THE ONLY PLACE
BIG ENOUGH.

22:38.661 --> 22:40.663
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
IT USED TO FIT
ON A BARDOAN'S ARM.

22:40.707 --> 22:42.404
THE SUCCESS RATE'S
A LITTLE DODGY, THOUGH.

22:42.448 --> 22:44.014
8 OUT OF 10 TIMES,
IT'S SAFE.

22:44.058 --> 22:46.756
THE OTHER TWO TIMES,
UH-UH, NOT SO MUCH.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.802
THAT'S WHY WE STOPPED
USING IT.

22:48.845 --> 22:50.369
THERE. DONE.

22:52.196 --> 22:53.676
HEY. I GOT YOU.

22:58.594 --> 23:00.335
-THANK YOU.
-OF COURSE.

23:03.251 --> 23:04.644
FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

23:04.687 --> 23:08.517
IT CAN'T LOOK LIKE
YOU HELPED US.

23:08.561 --> 23:10.127
UH!

23:14.741 --> 23:16.960
MAY WE MEET AGAIN.

23:17.004 --> 23:18.571
MAY WE MEET AGAIN.

23:22.836 --> 23:24.577
I'VE GOT YOU.
COME ON.

23:24.620 --> 23:26.622
LEVITT, OPEN
THE BRIDGE.

23:26.666 --> 23:28.102
LEVITT: ON IT.

23:34.282 --> 23:36.893
HOPE...I'M SO SORRY

23:36.937 --> 23:39.722
I NEVER CAME BACK
FOR YOU,

23:39.766 --> 23:41.289
BUT YOU'RE STRONG.

23:41.332 --> 23:43.465
I CAN SEE IT.

23:43.509 --> 23:45.641
YOUR MOTHER
WILL BE SO PROUD.

23:49.123 --> 23:51.734
I LOVE YOU,
LITTLE ONE.

23:51.778 --> 23:53.562
DON'T YOU EVER
FORGET IT.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.002
OCTAVIA, YOU NEED TO GO.

24:10.231 --> 24:11.885
YOU'LL NEVER MAKE IT.
YOU NEED TO GO, TOO.

24:11.928 --> 24:14.061
-I HAVE TO TRY.
-HOPE, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

24:14.104 --> 24:15.715
THEY'LL HAVE HELMETS, TOO,
THAT MEANS THAT--

24:29.772 --> 24:32.035
IN THE LIGHT
OF THE SHEPHERD.

24:32.079 --> 24:33.776
FOR ALL MANKIND.

24:33.820 --> 24:36.300
HE WILL SAVE US
FROM THE WAR TO END ALL WARS.

24:40.217 --> 24:42.176
WOMAN: HERE COMES
THE RETRIEVAL TEAM.

24:42.219 --> 24:43.830
TOOK THEM
LONG ENOUGH.

24:49.662 --> 24:50.619
UH!

24:55.406 --> 24:57.452
ECHO, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

24:57.496 --> 24:58.932
IT WASN'T ME.

25:03.850 --> 25:06.940
WITHOUT ORLANDO,
WE DON'T NEED TO TAKE
UNNECESSARY RISKS.

25:06.983 --> 25:10.944
LEAVING ORLANDO WAS
THE UNNECESSARY RISK.

25:10.987 --> 25:12.336
ECHO, ENOUGH.

25:12.380 --> 25:15.035
HOPE, TAKE
THE CONDUCTOR.

25:15.078 --> 25:16.602
FOCUS. WE'RE
ON THE CLOCK.

25:16.645 --> 25:19.387
CLOCK? WE DRILLED
FOR 5 YEARS.

25:19.430 --> 25:22.433
WE HAVE 30 MINUTES
TO GET TO THE CELL BLOCK,

25:22.477 --> 25:24.958
GET OUR PEOPLE,
AND GET BACK HERE
BEFORE SHIFT CHANGE.

25:25.001 --> 25:27.047
WITH ORLANDO OPENING
THE DOORS,

25:27.090 --> 25:28.570
THE BEST WE EVER DID
WAS 28 MINUTES.

25:28.614 --> 25:30.746
THEN I GUESS WE'D
BETTER HURRY.

25:30.790 --> 25:34.271
LOOK. WE ALL KNOW
THIS CAN'T BE DONE
WITHOUT AN INSIDE MAN.

25:34.315 --> 25:36.709
WE HAVE
AN INSIDE MAN.

25:36.752 --> 25:38.101
WHAT IF HE'S NOT
IN M-CAP?

25:38.145 --> 25:39.929
WHAT IF WHO'S
NOT IN M-CAP?

25:39.973 --> 25:43.237
THE MAN WHO HELPED
BEFORE--LEVITT.

25:43.280 --> 25:44.804
M-CAP'S
ON THIS LEVEL.

25:44.847 --> 25:46.806
WE WON'T LOSE
MUCH TIME.

25:46.849 --> 25:50.418
WOMAN, ON P.A.: THE SHEPHERD
BRINGS US WISDOM.

25:50.461 --> 25:54.814
THE SHEPHERD BRINGS US LOVE
FOR ALL MANKIND.

25:54.857 --> 25:56.816
DISCIPLES: FOR ALL MANKIND!

25:56.859 --> 25:58.295
28 MINUTES LET.

25:58.339 --> 25:59.775
ECHO: WE CAN ALL SEE
THAT, GABRIEL.

25:59.819 --> 26:01.081
HOPE: PLENTY OF TIME.

26:01.124 --> 26:03.170
THIS IS M-CAP.

26:03.213 --> 26:07.087
WOMAN: YOU 3, FALL IN.
WE'RE LATE.

26:07.130 --> 26:09.437
WOMAN, ON P.A.: YOUR ANCESTORS
CHOSE ANOTHER PATH,

26:09.480 --> 26:10.786
A DIFFICULT ONE.

26:10.830 --> 26:12.483
THERE WILL COME
A TIME AGAIN SOON

26:12.527 --> 26:14.355
WHERE WE WILL BE TESTED
TO A MAN,

26:14.398 --> 26:15.965
AND WE WILL BE VICTORIOUS.

26:16.009 --> 26:17.358
FOR ALL MANKIND!

26:17.401 --> 26:18.881
DISCIPLES: FOR ALL MANKIND!

26:21.014 --> 26:23.277
MAN, ON P.A.: AND NOW IT IS
MY GREATEST HONOR TO PRESENT

26:23.320 --> 26:26.236
THE ESTEEMED FIRST DISCIPLE,
WHO WILL LEAD US

26:26.280 --> 26:29.413
THROUGH TODAY'S LESSON
ON THE BOOK OF ALLNESS.

26:29.457 --> 26:31.285
ANDERS, ON P.A.:
THANK YOU, EMILIO.

26:31.328 --> 26:33.374
IN THE LIGHT
OF THE SHEPHERD.

26:33.417 --> 26:34.636
HELMETS OFF.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.116
FOR ALL MANKIND.

26:36.159 --> 26:38.901
DISCIPLES: FOR ALL MANKIND!

26:38.945 --> 26:42.339
THAT'S ANDERS.

26:42.383 --> 26:44.472
ANDERS: LET'S FIRST TAKE
A MOMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE

26:44.515 --> 26:47.736
OUR NEWEST CLASS
OF LEVEL 9s.

26:47.780 --> 26:50.478
YOU'VE EACH DEMONSTRATED
IMPRESSIVE DEVOTION

26:50.521 --> 26:51.697
TO THE SHEPHERD.

26:51.740 --> 26:53.655
OUR PREDECESSORS ON THIS PLANET

26:53.699 --> 26:56.658
DID NOT SHARE THAT FAITH.

26:56.702 --> 26:59.269
LIKE OUR ANCESTORS ON EARTH,

26:59.313 --> 27:02.229
THEY DESTROYED THEIR WORLD.

27:02.272 --> 27:05.275
EVEN BEFORE THEY WERE
WIPED OUT BY GEN 9

27:05.319 --> 27:07.843
AND TURNED INTO
CRYSTAL GIANTS,

27:07.887 --> 27:09.889
THEIR ATMOSPHERE
WAS SO POLLUTED,

27:09.932 --> 27:12.631
THEY WERE FORCED TO BUILD
FORESTS UNDERGROUND

27:12.674 --> 27:15.198
IN ORDER TO BREATHE.

27:15.242 --> 27:19.072
EVEN THE RAIN THAT SHOULD
FALL FROM THE SKY

27:19.115 --> 27:24.120
FALLS INSTEAD
BY THEIR TECHNOLOGY.

27:24.164 --> 27:28.690
FOR THAT, WE THANK THEM,
BUT WHERE ARE THEY NOW?

27:28.734 --> 27:31.475
WE KNOW THAT BY THE TIME
THE SHEPHERD DELIVERED US

27:31.519 --> 27:36.045
WITH THE STONE THAT
THE BARDOANS WERE GONE, EXTINCT.

27:36.089 --> 27:37.525
WHY IS THAT?

27:37.568 --> 27:38.918
WOMAN: THEY DIDN'T
HAVE THE SHEPHERD!

27:40.310 --> 27:41.790
NO, THEY DIDN'T
DID THEY?

27:41.834 --> 27:44.184
HE SAID THE STONE
DELIVERED THEM.

27:44.227 --> 27:45.664
SO?

27:45.707 --> 27:48.405
SO THEY WEREN'T
ELIGIUS.

27:48.449 --> 27:50.059
THERE WAS A STONE
ON EARTH.

27:50.103 --> 27:53.019
ANDERS: THAT SAME ENEMY
IS COMING AFTER US,

27:53.062 --> 27:56.283
BUT IN THE LIGHT
OF THE SHEPHERD,

27:56.326 --> 27:59.547
WE WILL NOT LOSE.

27:59.590 --> 28:02.681
DISCIPLES: FOR ALL MANKIND!

28:02.724 --> 28:05.379
THAT MEANS ORLANDO
DIDN'T TELL US
EVERYTHING.

28:05.422 --> 28:08.208
-WE SHOULD GO.
-WHERE'S HOPE?

28:08.251 --> 28:10.297
ANDERS: WE'RE CLOSE NOW.

28:10.340 --> 28:12.995
WE'VE LOCATED THE KEY.

28:13.039 --> 28:18.784
AFTER HUNDREDS OF YEARS,
IT HAS RETURNED TO US.

28:18.827 --> 28:24.137
OURS IS THE GENERATION
THAT WILL WIN THE LAST WAR!

28:27.662 --> 28:29.185
OUR SHEPHERD WILL RISE...

28:29.229 --> 28:30.491
WE'RE ON A MISSION.

28:30.534 --> 28:32.232
ARE YOU OUT
OF YOUR MIND?

28:32.275 --> 28:36.889
ANDERS: AS WE FIGHT
THIS FIGHT FOR ALL MANKIND!

28:40.022 --> 28:42.372
LOOK. I KNOW
HOW YOU FEEL,

28:42.416 --> 28:44.244
BUT WHAT DO YOU
SAY THIS TIME

28:44.287 --> 28:45.985
WE DON'T FAIL?

28:48.074 --> 28:51.251
ANDERS:
FOR ALL MANKIND!

28:51.294 --> 28:54.602
DISCIPLES: FOR ALL MANKIND!

28:54.645 --> 28:56.212
ANDERS, VOICE-OVER:
YOU'RE BLEEDING.

29:00.260 --> 29:01.652
WHAT HAPPENED?

29:03.698 --> 29:05.395
-I'M FINE.
-YOU'RE NOT FINE.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.225
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?
WHO DID THIS?

29:09.269 --> 29:11.010
WE NEED HER WELL
FOR THE MISSION

29:11.053 --> 29:12.315
SHE'S ABOUT TO UNDERTAKE.

29:12.359 --> 29:14.143
MAN:
IT WASN'T US, SIR.

29:14.187 --> 29:15.928
NO ONE'S BEEN IN OR OUT
FOR THE LAST 24 DAYS.

29:15.971 --> 29:17.668
SHE AND ANOTHER
M-CAP SESSION
WITH LEVITT.

29:17.712 --> 29:19.279
HIS REPORT SHOULD BE
IN YOUR SYSTEM.

29:19.322 --> 29:21.455
I'VE SEEN IT.
IT WAS WORTHLESS TO US.

29:21.498 --> 29:24.937
UNLIKE OCTAVIA,
SHE KNOWS NOTHING
ABOUT THE KEY.

29:24.980 --> 29:26.547
BE CAREFUL
OF THIS ONE.

29:26.590 --> 29:28.505
SHE TURNED AN L-7
AND SET FREE

29:28.549 --> 29:31.682
OUR MOST IMPORTANT ASSET
BEFORE GETTING CAPTURED.

29:33.815 --> 29:35.730
ROLL UP HER SLEEVE,
SEE WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.211
TOUCH ME, AND I WON'T
DO YOUR BIDDING.

29:38.254 --> 29:41.475
OH, I THINK YOU WILL.
YOUR MOTHER'S LIFE
DEPENDS ON IT,

29:41.518 --> 29:43.303
AND THAT IS NOT
A WEAPON WE GAVE YOU.

29:43.346 --> 29:45.131
IT'S A TAGGING DEVICE.

29:45.174 --> 29:47.829
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU VALUE INDIVIDUALS

29:47.873 --> 29:49.396
ABOVE THE COLLECTIVE.

29:49.439 --> 29:51.311
IT'S CALLED LOVE,
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

29:51.354 --> 29:53.095
IT'S WHY DEV TURNED.

29:55.271 --> 29:56.969
IT'S WHY YOU'RE
A PRISONER

29:57.012 --> 29:58.535
DRESSED LIKE A SAVAGE,

29:58.579 --> 30:00.581
SO YOU CAN GET CLOSE
ENOUGH STICK THAT BLADE

30:00.624 --> 30:02.539
INTO AUNTY O. AND
BRING HER BACK TO ME.

30:02.583 --> 30:05.455
-WHY DO YOU CARE ABOUT HER?
-I DON'T.

30:05.499 --> 30:07.196
I CARE ABOUT CLARKE.

30:07.240 --> 30:09.851
SHE'S THE KEY
TO EVERYTHING.

30:09.895 --> 30:11.200
WHAT?

30:15.814 --> 30:17.772
IT'S GO TIME, CAPTAIN.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.600
REMEMBER, BECAUSE
OF TIME DILATION,

30:19.643 --> 30:22.124
NO ONE WILL COME FOR YOU
IF YOU FAIL.

30:22.168 --> 30:23.647
-WE UNDERSTAND.
-GOOD.

30:23.691 --> 30:27.347
I WANT CLARKE GRIFFIN
BACK HERE UNHARMED.

30:27.390 --> 30:29.828
THE SHEPHERD IS
COUNTING ON YOU.

30:29.871 --> 30:31.481
WHAT ABOUT
THE GIRL--HOPE?

30:31.525 --> 30:34.876
SHE'S CLEARLY
A THREAT.

30:34.920 --> 30:38.184
ONCE HER JOB IS DONE,

30:38.227 --> 30:39.620
TERMINATE.

30:45.582 --> 30:46.888
HOPE.

30:46.932 --> 30:48.803
I COULDN'T
GET OUT OF IT.

30:48.847 --> 30:51.545
HE HAS MY MOTHER.

30:51.588 --> 30:54.069
I'M SO SORRY,
OCTAVIA.

30:55.462 --> 30:56.942
BELLAMY: OCTAVIA,
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

30:56.985 --> 30:58.595
ECHO: KNIFE!
BELLAMY: O.

31:09.780 --> 31:11.347
ANDERS: HELLO,
MISS BLAKE.

31:19.921 --> 31:24.273
HMM. BE THANKFUL
YOU CAME BACK
IN ONE PIECE.

31:28.625 --> 31:30.236
GET HER TO MEDICAL.

31:30.279 --> 31:33.021
I WANT HER BACK IN M-CAP
BY THE END OF THE DAY.

31:33.065 --> 31:34.675
WE'RE NOT FINISHED YET.

31:45.686 --> 31:47.122
MURPHY: OK. NOW THAT
JUST TICKLES.

31:47.166 --> 31:49.820
TREY: THAT'S ENOUGH.
IT'S TIME.

31:49.864 --> 31:51.910
REALLY? I WAS JUST
STARTING TO ENJOY THAT.

31:51.953 --> 31:53.955
LOOKS LIKE YOU'LL
FINALLY BURN FOR
OUR BLASPHEMY.

31:53.999 --> 31:56.392
WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS!

31:56.436 --> 31:58.351
SHUT UP, FALSE GOD!
YOU BURN TODAY!

31:58.394 --> 31:59.526
GET THE HELL
OFF OF ME!

32:02.442 --> 32:03.834
MAN: RUSSELL PRIME!

32:03.878 --> 32:06.402
RUSSELL, KAYLEE,
HALLOWED BE YOUR NAMES.

32:06.446 --> 32:08.056
FAITHFUL: HALLOWED
BE YOUR HAMES.

32:08.100 --> 32:10.450
-HEY, SIS.
-SILENCE, FALSE GOD.

32:10.493 --> 32:13.322
RUSSELL: FALSE GOD?
TREY: YES, HOLINESS.

32:13.366 --> 32:14.802
THIS MAN IS
AN IMPOSTOR.

32:14.845 --> 32:16.586
IT'S NOT
DANIEL PRIME.

32:18.066 --> 32:20.199
I WASN'T SPEAKING
TO YOU.

32:20.242 --> 32:21.635
ZEV: IT'S THE TRUTH,
MY LORD.

32:21.678 --> 32:23.115
DANIEL PRIME AND I
WERE CLOSE.

32:23.158 --> 32:24.681
THIS MAN DIDN'T
RECOGNIZE ME.

32:24.725 --> 32:26.161
HE COULDN'T EVEN NAME
THE 4 PILLAR--

32:29.599 --> 32:31.384
I SHOULD TEAR
YOUR TONGUE

32:31.427 --> 32:33.560
THROUGH YOUR
THROAT FOR THAT.

32:33.603 --> 32:35.866
INDRA: RUSSELL,
GET TO THE POINT.

32:39.044 --> 32:44.092
DANIEL, KAYLEE, AND I
ARE THE LAST OF THE PRIMES.

32:44.136 --> 32:45.920
JUST TONIGHT, HE GAVE ME
HIS BLOOD

32:45.964 --> 32:47.617
SO THAT THIS BODY
WOULD LIVE

32:47.661 --> 32:53.623
AFTER ONE OF THE FALLEN
TRIED TO TAKE MY LIFE.

32:53.667 --> 32:57.192
I LOVE HIM LIKE A SON.

32:57.236 --> 32:59.325
NOW RELEASE HIM!

33:11.467 --> 33:13.992
CERTAINLY TOOK
YOU LONG ENOUGH.

33:14.035 --> 33:17.343
HAD TO FIND
THE RIGHT DRESS.

33:17.386 --> 33:20.041
YOU DID.

33:20.085 --> 33:24.306
RUSSELL: MY, MY, MY.

33:24.350 --> 33:29.746
WHAT FOOLISH
LITTLE LAMBS YOU ARE.

33:29.790 --> 33:34.621
THE LAST THING I WANT
IS FOR ALL OF YOU TO DIE.

33:34.664 --> 33:38.016
IN THE SAME NIGHT
YOUR UPRISING STAYED
MY EXECUTION,

33:38.059 --> 33:43.108
YOU THOUGHT IT WISE
TO SACRIFICE YOURSELVES?

33:43.151 --> 33:45.240
YOU'RE THE ONLY THING
KEEPING ME ALIVE!

33:45.284 --> 33:48.896
PLEASE FORGIVE US,
RUSSELL.

33:48.939 --> 33:52.291
YOU WANT FORGIVENESS,

33:52.334 --> 33:54.075
THEN SHOW ME
YOUR FEALTY.

33:54.119 --> 33:56.730
TREY: ANYTHING.
JUST TELL ME
WHAT TO DO.

33:56.773 --> 33:58.340
HMM.

33:58.384 --> 33:59.559
KNEEL.

34:01.909 --> 34:05.086
ALL OF YOU,
KNEEL OR DIE.

34:08.916 --> 34:11.745
INDRA, WHAT'S WRONG?

34:11.788 --> 34:15.879
I'VE HEARD
THAT BEFORE.

34:15.923 --> 34:17.533
THAT'S BETTER.

34:20.319 --> 34:23.365
NO GO HOME AND PRAY
ON YOUR SINS.

34:23.409 --> 34:24.888
MURPHY: GOOD SHOW.

34:26.673 --> 34:28.066
YOU'RE WELCOME.

34:53.961 --> 34:56.659
ESCORT RUSSELL PRIME
BACK TO THE LAB.

35:22.685 --> 35:24.034
LEAVE US.

35:28.082 --> 35:29.562
NOW WE KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED TO THE CODE

35:29.605 --> 35:31.259
WHEN WE SAVED
THE COMMANDER.

35:31.303 --> 35:35.742
HMM. SHE WAS TOO WEAK
TO BE A COMMANDER,

35:35.785 --> 35:37.570
AND YOU KNOW IT.

36:01.942 --> 36:03.291
AH.

36:06.555 --> 36:09.863
AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
IF YOU MAKE ME A MARTYR.

36:09.906 --> 36:12.170
YES. THE SAME THING
THAT HAPPENS

36:12.213 --> 36:14.824
IF ANYONE FINDS OUT
WHO YOU ARE.

36:14.868 --> 36:17.218
AH.

36:17.262 --> 36:19.568
ONLY THEN,
AS THE PEOPLE RIOT

36:19.612 --> 36:21.396
FOR THE LOSS
OF THEIR GOD,

36:21.440 --> 36:23.964
I CAN SLIT
YOUR THROAT.

36:24.007 --> 36:25.400
AHH.

36:27.141 --> 36:28.403
COME IN!

36:33.016 --> 36:36.281
WHAT'S THE MEANING
OF THIS?

36:36.324 --> 36:39.719
-UP.
-AGH! AGH.

36:39.762 --> 36:41.677
I MIGHT NOT BE
ABLE TO KILL YOU,

36:41.721 --> 36:44.245
BUT I CAN MAKE SURE
WHEN I DO,

36:44.289 --> 36:47.205
YOU DON'T COME BACK.

36:48.858 --> 36:50.295
DEATH TO PRIMES.

36:52.297 --> 36:55.604
JACKSON: FOR THE PAIN.
INDRA: NO.

36:55.648 --> 36:58.259
LET HIM FEEL IT...

36:58.303 --> 36:59.739
FOR ABBY.

37:33.468 --> 37:36.079
LEVITT: OCTAVIA?

37:36.123 --> 37:37.907
OCTAVIA!

37:37.951 --> 37:39.474
I'M SO SORRY
THIS HAPPENED TO YOU.

37:39.518 --> 37:41.302
I DID EVERYTHING I COULD
TO HELP HOPE,

37:41.346 --> 37:44.436
INCLUDING SURGICALLY
IMPLANTING A MESSAGE
IN HER ARM.

37:44.479 --> 37:46.438
I'M SORRY TO SAY THIS
WILL BE OUR LAST SESSION.

37:46.481 --> 37:48.135
-WHY?
-THEY'RE TAKING ME

37:48.178 --> 37:49.571
OFF YOUR CASE.

37:49.615 --> 37:51.225
I THINK THEY THINK
I'VE GOTTEN TOO CLOSE.

37:51.269 --> 37:52.574
LISTEN TO ME.
WHO EVER TAKES MY PLACE,

37:52.618 --> 37:53.967
YOU CAN'T FIGHT THEM.

37:54.010 --> 37:55.316
YOUR BRAIN
WILL HEMORRHAGE,

37:55.360 --> 37:56.970
BUT YOU CAN BEAT
THE MACHINE

37:57.013 --> 37:58.580
IF YOU KEEP YOUR MIND FOCUSED
ON A SINGLE THOUGHT,

37:58.624 --> 38:01.496
A MANTRA LIKE YOUR MOM
HAD YOU SAY UNDER THE FLOOR.

38:01.540 --> 38:03.672
-"I'M NOT AFRAID."
-YES. GOOD.

38:03.716 --> 38:05.283
LET'S TRY IT.

38:09.461 --> 38:10.810
CAN I HELP YOU, SIR?

38:10.853 --> 38:12.942
HER BROTHER
IS HERE.

38:12.986 --> 38:16.032
I NEED HER TO
TALK HIM DOWN.

38:16.076 --> 38:18.339
NO ONE ELSE
HAS TO DIE.

38:29.002 --> 38:31.178
OCTAVIA: I AM NOT AFRAID.

38:31.221 --> 38:34.050
I AM NOT AFRAID.

38:34.094 --> 38:35.356
I AM NOT AFRAID.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.750
-LEVITT?
-I AM NOT AFRAID.

38:37.793 --> 38:40.448
IT'S NOT HIM. HEY.

38:40.492 --> 38:42.102
I AM NOT AFRAID.

38:42.145 --> 38:43.625
-AUNTY O.
-I AM NOT AFRAID.

38:43.669 --> 38:45.061
AUNTY O., IT'S ME.

38:45.105 --> 38:47.194
I AM NOT AFRAID.
I AM NOT AFRAID.

38:47.237 --> 38:52.417
HER BROTHER,
WHERE IS HE?

38:52.460 --> 38:55.637
SHOW ME,
OR I TAKE AN EYE.

38:55.681 --> 38:58.597
OCTAVIA: I AM NOT AFRAID.

38:58.640 --> 39:00.468
I AM NOT AFRAID.

39:07.693 --> 39:09.085
HEY, BIG BROTHER.

39:09.129 --> 39:11.131
LET HER GO
RIGHT NOW.

39:11.174 --> 39:12.698
ANDERS: WE CAN'T DO THAT.

39:12.741 --> 39:14.830
THESE GOOD MEN,
WHO YOU KILLED,

39:14.874 --> 39:17.529
BROUGHT YOU HERE
FROM SANCTUM
FOR A REASON.

39:17.572 --> 39:21.402
LET THE CONDUCTOR GO,
AND THEN WE CAN TALK.

39:21.446 --> 39:23.273
HER FIRST.

39:23.317 --> 39:26.233
HERE'S NO OTHER WAY OUT
OF THIS FOR YOU, MR. BLAKE.

39:26.276 --> 39:28.409
OCTAVIA:
BELL, HE'S RIGHT.

39:28.453 --> 39:31.586
OPEN THE BRIDGE
AND SEND HIM BACK TO SANCTUM.

39:31.630 --> 39:33.893
I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING
YOU WANT TO KNOW,

39:33.936 --> 39:37.723
EVEN ABOUT CLARKE.

39:37.766 --> 39:39.333
WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

39:45.165 --> 39:49.212
-NO. SIR, YOU CAN'T. THE--
-SHUT UP!

39:49.256 --> 39:50.736
BELL, IT'S OK.

39:52.738 --> 39:54.392
I CAN'T LET YOU
DIE TO SAVE ME.

39:57.656 --> 40:00.920
JUMP THROUGH.
I'LL BE OK.

40:00.963 --> 40:02.922
NO WAY...

40:02.965 --> 40:04.402
NOT WITHOUT YOU.

40:04.445 --> 40:06.404
I DO THE SHEPHERD'S
BIDDING

40:06.447 --> 40:08.318
FOR ALL MANKIND.

40:09.929 --> 40:11.800
BELLAMY, GET DOWN!

40:23.725 --> 40:27.512
MAN: THERE'S BEEN EXPLOSION
IN THE STONE ROOM.

40:27.555 --> 40:31.341
I REPEAT. THERE'S BEEN
AN EXPLOSION IN THE STONE ROOM.

40:31.385 --> 40:34.388
BELLAMY!

40:45.268 --> 40:46.487
NO.

40:51.884 --> 40:54.495
UH! UH!

40:56.062 --> 40:59.021
THAT CAN'T BE REAL.

40:59.065 --> 41:00.632
IS THAT REAL?

41:04.026 --> 41:05.680
TIME'S UP.
THEY KNOW WE'RE HERE!

41:06.942 --> 41:08.640
ECHO, I'M SORRY
ABOUT BELLAMY,

41:08.683 --> 41:10.163
BUT WE NEED TO TAKE
HIM AS A HOSTAGE.

MY MOTHER.
