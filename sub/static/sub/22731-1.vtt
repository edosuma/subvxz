03:57.629 --> 04:00.847
<i>Message deleted. Next message.</i>

04:00.927 --> 04:04.984
<i>Hey, uh, it's me.
Um, yeah, dinner's on the go.</i>

04:05.064 --> 04:09.388
<i>Uh, look forward to seeing you at home.
Okay. Love you. Bye.</i>

04:54.864 --> 04:56.705
Hello, you.

04:56.785 --> 04:58.106
I can't decide what to wear.

04:58.686 --> 05:00.609
That's just the fallout.

05:00.689 --> 05:03.175
It'll be like you never left.

05:09.765 --> 05:11.354
How's the real world?

05:11.434 --> 05:13.755
Mm. Just want to shower it all off.

05:13.835 --> 05:16.258
- Guess what.
- What?

05:16.638 --> 05:18.327
We got the grant.

05:18.407 --> 05:20.995
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

05:21.075 --> 05:22.411
Dr. Kealey.

05:23.411 --> 05:26.836
It will mean more time away.

05:32.554 --> 05:36.280
God, we had this ridiculous
team-building exercise today...

05:36.360 --> 05:38.265
...but I...

05:39.930 --> 05:42.053
What are you burning?

05:42.133 --> 05:43.988
Oh, shit.

05:45.568 --> 05:48.392
- Okay.
- I thought this was a recipe book.

05:48.772 --> 05:51.062
You should see this place, hmm?

05:51.642 --> 05:54.732
Full of all the creepy-crawly
nature stuff? No, thank you.

05:54.812 --> 05:58.702
- No phone reception, for a start.
- That sounds awful.

05:58.782 --> 06:01.940
- How long till we eat?
- Mm.

06:02.020 --> 06:04.476
Oh, Adam, gross.

06:04.556 --> 06:06.376
Not by the food.

06:09.194 --> 06:10.749
Lookit...

06:11.829 --> 06:14.247
...I know that this has been hard on us.

06:15.334 --> 06:16.922
But...

06:17.402 --> 06:19.800
...we're almost out on the other side...

06:20.156 --> 06:21.681
...okay?

06:23.141 --> 06:26.164
I am proud of you. What you do matters.

06:26.244 --> 06:27.648
It's real.

06:31.683 --> 06:35.289
No, you do not leave that stove.
I'm starving.

06:39.942 --> 06:41.570
- Hello.
- <i>So I have to call...</i>

06:41.650 --> 06:44.148
<i>...from another number just to get...</i>

08:10.153 --> 08:12.043
Take me with you...

08:13.423 --> 08:15.275
...just you and me.

08:51.178 --> 08:52.996
What's going on?

08:58.403 --> 09:01.760
Pete and I have been working
on this for months.

09:01.840 --> 09:03.728
It's a big deal.

09:04.108 --> 09:07.333
When I get back, you know, we'll... we'll...

09:07.963 --> 09:09.802
...we'll go away.

09:11.182 --> 09:12.905
Please. Come on.
This isn't the kind of trip...

09:12.985 --> 09:14.506
Don't!

09:15.686 --> 09:16.859
Take me.

09:16.939 --> 09:19.174
Take me to this world you've been hiding.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.274
Pete.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.781
You know I'd never...

09:53.961 --> 09:55.849
Ah, shit.

09:56.329 --> 09:58.153
Need to talk about this trip.

09:58.933 --> 10:00.754
Something's come up.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.024
You bet. Are you driving?

10:03.604 --> 10:05.592
No, you better come down.

10:05.672 --> 10:08.163
Yeah, now's good.

10:08.843 --> 10:11.540
Sorry. Sorry. Hang on a second, Pete.

10:12.020 --> 10:13.596
Shannon.

10:15.517 --> 10:17.573
Look, I don't really think that...

10:18.653 --> 10:20.494
One second.

10:21.490 --> 10:23.837
- Sorry. Where were we?
- Hi, Shan.

10:23.917 --> 10:26.815
<i>Hi. We're on for Saturday, right?</i>

10:27.895 --> 10:31.018
<i>Have you forgotten? The dress.</i>

10:31.498 --> 10:35.934
<i>Hey, if Adam's going in the morning,
why don't you stay with me for the weekend?</i>

10:39.522 --> 10:41.997
<i>Forget it. You seem...</i>

10:42.077 --> 10:45.100
Shannon, sorry. I'm going with Adam.

10:45.180 --> 10:48.438
You know, I'll call you later. Promise.

10:52.003 --> 10:54.289
Why have you never given them to me?

10:56.759 --> 10:58.646
I don't know.

10:58.726 --> 11:01.214
Won't the firm fall apart without you?

11:04.300 --> 11:06.190
It's quite a leap...

11:06.770 --> 11:08.292
...this...

11:09.072 --> 11:14.153
...going from boycotting anything
to do with shoes like these to...

11:14.977 --> 11:17.062
...well, to where we're headed.

11:20.117 --> 11:23.174
- It's isolated.
- And I know.

11:23.854 --> 11:25.739
I want to be part of this.

11:30.294 --> 11:33.150
Well, that's our lead,
Scarabaeoidea Coleoptera.

11:33.230 --> 11:36.283
Some locals stumbled across it, and...

11:36.363 --> 11:39.908
...if it is a whole new species, then we're
gonna have to move fast to protect it.

11:45.676 --> 11:48.896
Hello. It's Pete.

11:55.053 --> 11:57.709
I'm gonna need to deal
with this face to face.

11:58.189 --> 12:00.480
- You wait for me.
- Yeah.

12:00.560 --> 12:02.444
We'll eat together.

12:30.326 --> 12:33.546
Last chance to go girly on me.
No going back from here.

12:33.626 --> 12:35.467
He says in reverse.

12:40.300 --> 12:41.617
Here.

12:42.437 --> 12:45.192
- What's this?
- Watertight and shockproof...

12:45.272 --> 12:47.862
- ...for the urban addict.
- Aw, he loves me.

12:47.942 --> 12:50.185
Yeah, he knows you.

12:50.265 --> 12:53.568
- It's cute. I like it.
- In nature, that color is an alarm...

12:53.648 --> 12:56.358
...means, "Leave me the fuck alone.
I'm poisonous."

12:56.438 --> 12:58.507
So, do we, like, have a matching
pair or something?

12:58.587 --> 13:00.275
No.

13:00.355 --> 13:03.379
No, I've, uh, got a spare phone in my bag.

13:04.059 --> 13:07.481
You know, if it wasn't
for this tiny, little stag beetle...

13:07.861 --> 13:10.108
...we wouldn't even be allowed in there.

13:10.933 --> 13:12.823
Come on!

13:13.603 --> 13:15.692
There's a lot riding on this, you know?

13:16.472 --> 13:18.293
But they are there.

13:18.673 --> 13:20.563
I'm sure of it.

13:20.643 --> 13:22.330
I like that...

13:22.410 --> 13:24.973
...something flourishing, despite us.

13:26.783 --> 13:28.538
Not feeling well?

13:28.618 --> 13:31.241
Roll the window down. Get yourself some air.

13:41.096 --> 13:45.115
Hey, babe, I just really suck at being
a passenger. Do you mind if I drive?

13:47.436 --> 13:49.994
I'll get the med bag for you,
see if we got anything in there, eh?

13:50.074 --> 13:53.893
I'll be fine if...
if you're not behind the wheel.

13:57.280 --> 13:58.965
Thanks.

14:23.508 --> 14:26.698
- You might be in luck.
- That looks serious.

14:26.778 --> 14:30.935
Yeah. Pete's brother
brought her back from Baghdad.

14:31.015 --> 14:34.073
She comes on every trip. It's our lucky bag.

14:34.753 --> 14:36.408
She?

14:36.488 --> 14:38.031
Matilda.

14:39.792 --> 14:44.058
Right. Tape, bandages, sterile...

14:44.138 --> 14:45.450
...atropine.

14:45.530 --> 14:47.987
- What's that?
- Huh?

14:48.067 --> 14:50.930
That is our comedown
in case of chemical warfare...

14:51.010 --> 14:53.392
...but we keep it in case of a snakebite.

14:53.472 --> 14:55.927
Or we could take it and watch the stars.

14:56.007 --> 14:58.097
I'll be keeping that away from you, then.

14:58.187 --> 15:00.438
Anyway, there's only enough for one of us.

15:00.518 --> 15:02.802
Mm, doesn't look like we've got anything.

15:03.082 --> 15:05.573
So who would get to take it, then?

15:05.653 --> 15:07.564
Oh, me of course.

15:13.948 --> 15:16.717
- See the sign for Suicide Gorge?
- Yeah.

15:16.797 --> 15:19.790
- Follow that sign.
- Are you serious?

15:19.870 --> 15:21.988
It's only gonna be found here in the gorge.

15:22.068 --> 15:24.321
Their ecosystem is that small.

15:41.689 --> 15:43.574
Thank you.

15:45.359 --> 15:47.449
I don't like what I did to Pete.

15:48.479 --> 15:50.532
I like what you did for us.

16:10.852 --> 16:12.438
Thanks.

16:13.724 --> 16:16.347
- It's already so hot.
- Yeah.

16:16.927 --> 16:18.548
All right...

16:18.628 --> 16:21.985
...shouldn't take any longer than a couple
of hours to hike up to the summit.

16:22.065 --> 16:23.955
We descend from there.

16:25.735 --> 16:28.368
Don't we need more stuff?

16:29.772 --> 16:32.729
There's a research hut
on the other side of the gorge.

16:32.809 --> 16:34.764
It's got supplies in it.

16:34.844 --> 16:36.508
- You got Nemo?
- Huh?

16:36.588 --> 16:40.840
Your phone. He hasn't got long left,
just patches of reception.

16:43.320 --> 16:45.410
He's not the only fish out of water.

16:46.090 --> 16:47.608
Okay.

16:53.796 --> 16:55.885
You gonna walk this slowly the whole way?

16:55.965 --> 16:58.421
Couldn't you find a bug
in, like, the Bahamas?

16:58.501 --> 17:02.159
'Cause of the heat, they spend
most of their lives underground...

17:30.903 --> 17:32.959
You know, when I find it...

17:33.039 --> 17:35.193
...I'm gonna name it after you.

17:35.273 --> 17:36.796
Who?

17:37.076 --> 17:38.632
Scarabaeoidea.

17:39.612 --> 17:42.102
The whole reason that we're...

17:42.982 --> 17:44.866
Never mind.

17:51.692 --> 17:53.515
It all kinda looks the same.

17:54.495 --> 17:56.379
I find it frightening.

18:14.065 --> 18:15.604
Right.

18:16.284 --> 18:18.105
The smaller stone...

18:18.485 --> 18:20.575
...in the direction of home...

18:21.455 --> 18:23.306
...and there you go.

18:32.299 --> 18:34.461
You can always turn it off.

18:59.062 --> 19:00.864
All right.

19:01.530 --> 19:03.348
Here we are.

19:07.871 --> 19:10.291
Ah, we'll climb straight down from here.

19:20.716 --> 19:22.234
Okay.

19:35.849 --> 19:37.400
Gwynn.

19:40.137 --> 19:41.658
Look.

19:41.738 --> 19:43.829
It's a baboon spider.

19:44.509 --> 19:47.357
It's creepy beautiful. Does he bite?

19:47.437 --> 19:49.205
- No.
- Okay.

19:49.285 --> 19:51.069
This one's got tiny jaws.

19:51.149 --> 19:52.904
Hold him?

19:52.984 --> 19:56.007
This one actually looks like
he's been stung by a wasp.

19:56.087 --> 19:57.942
That's why he's so docile.

19:58.322 --> 20:01.180
A wasp will probably be digging
around here somewhere.

20:01.260 --> 20:03.081
She'll bury him alive.

20:03.461 --> 20:06.317
- Why?
- Keep him fresh for her eggs...

20:06.397 --> 20:10.021
- ...which she's already laid inside of him.
- Isn't there anything we can do?

20:10.101 --> 20:11.953
It's already done.

20:19.346 --> 20:21.163
No, let me go first.

20:23.348 --> 20:27.040
Just watch your step.
The snakes are out this time of year.

20:27.120 --> 20:29.808
- That's comforting.
- Don't worry about it.

20:29.888 --> 20:32.713
The birds'll let you know
if you get too close.

20:33.493 --> 20:35.712
Butcherbird makes a hell of a noise.

21:16.905 --> 21:18.456
Wow.

21:20.608 --> 21:22.451
Look at this place.

21:23.011 --> 21:24.900
It's magical.

21:24.980 --> 21:28.071
- Worth it, right?
- How did you find it?

21:28.551 --> 21:30.907
I don't know. It's just...

21:30.987 --> 21:33.248
...perk of the trade, I guess.

21:39.395 --> 21:41.983
Right. We should keep moving.

21:42.063 --> 21:43.887
This is no place to camp.

21:44.167 --> 21:46.206
The sun will hit early.

21:47.136 --> 21:50.157
- No, no, no, no, no.
- I'm done.

22:11.160 --> 22:13.413
I am in love with this place.

24:36.246 --> 24:38.068
You hungry?

24:39.148 --> 24:40.966
Thank you.

24:42.753 --> 24:44.541
Camp out here.

24:44.621 --> 24:46.501
The wine'll make up for it.

24:58.067 --> 24:59.953
I know this.

25:01.239 --> 25:02.294
Italy.

25:03.674 --> 25:06.796
Remember? Under the olive trees.

25:08.046 --> 25:09.924
How did you find it?

25:10.004 --> 25:12.633
Might have hidden one away
for a special occasion.

25:26.631 --> 25:28.693
What took you so long to get here?

25:31.337 --> 25:33.155
I'm here.

25:41.579 --> 25:43.097
Okay.

31:29.142 --> 31:30.726
Gwynn.

31:57.037 --> 31:58.045
Gwynn.

32:08.316 --> 32:09.866
Gwynn.

32:14.023 --> 32:15.539
There's something in the tent.

32:23.232 --> 32:24.516
Don't move.

32:35.789 --> 32:38.664
Don't... move.

33:07.912 --> 33:09.596
Where is it?

33:19.713 --> 33:21.579
- Christ.
- What is it?

33:21.659 --> 33:24.802
- A black mamba.
- Get it out.

33:24.882 --> 33:26.452
Gwynneth.

33:27.432 --> 33:30.084
Don't move.

33:46.851 --> 33:49.708
If it bites,
we've got 20 minutes to get help.

33:49.788 --> 33:53.070
Gwynneth, you have to calm down.

34:00.667 --> 34:03.876
If we're calm, it's calm.

34:11.710 --> 34:14.501
You have to calm your breathing. Okay?

34:14.581 --> 34:16.402
And then what?

34:19.520 --> 34:21.071
Adam.

34:40.507 --> 34:43.130
- Look, if we're gonna get out...
- If?

34:43.210 --> 34:45.463
...we can't get bitten.

34:50.583 --> 34:52.475
Kill it.

34:53.255 --> 34:54.621
Your knife.

34:58.459 --> 35:00.310
It's outside.

35:02.330 --> 35:05.626
- I fell asleep.
- What else can we do?

35:07.737 --> 35:09.323
Did you let it in?

35:10.472 --> 35:11.861
There has to be something.

35:11.941 --> 35:15.163
You don't just take on a fucking black mamba
with your bare hands, do you?

35:15.243 --> 35:17.058
We can't just lie here, either.

35:19.202 --> 35:21.065
Do something.

35:35.065 --> 35:36.934
Oh, God.

35:38.434 --> 35:40.287
We need to get it away from the door.

35:55.019 --> 35:56.841
The sleeping bag...

35:57.621 --> 35:59.502
...we can use it as a shield.

36:01.326 --> 36:03.581
But you will have to move.

36:04.728 --> 36:06.546
Yes, you can.

36:08.837 --> 36:10.356
Ready?

36:13.004 --> 36:14.516
Slowly.

36:16.240 --> 36:17.825
Easy.

36:19.094 --> 36:20.659
Don't.

36:24.749 --> 36:26.334
Slowly.

37:04.791 --> 37:06.747
You okay? You all right?

37:06.827 --> 37:08.674
You're all right.

37:11.899 --> 37:14.335
Wait. Stop.

37:16.360 --> 37:18.220
Can you see it?

37:33.455 --> 37:35.006
It's going to touch you.

37:40.878 --> 37:43.756
- My leg.
- It's all right.

37:46.368 --> 37:48.556
I need you to stay with me.

37:48.636 --> 37:50.525
Stay with me.

37:58.777 --> 38:00.631
Come on.

38:06.020 --> 38:07.901
It might draw him off you.

39:26.306 --> 39:28.162
Look at me.

39:28.942 --> 39:30.793
I can't.

39:32.411 --> 39:35.430
Gwynneth, if it hits my heart,
I've got five minutes.

39:38.752 --> 39:40.569
Look at me.

39:46.059 --> 39:48.179
You need to get yourself out.

39:49.429 --> 39:51.011
No.

39:57.036 --> 39:59.322
I always wanted you out here, you know?

40:01.708 --> 40:03.593
Don't say that.

40:13.020 --> 40:14.838
I could grab its neck...

40:17.659 --> 40:19.477
...hold it down.

40:22.329 --> 40:24.132
It'd give you a chance.

40:26.433 --> 40:28.257
Then what?

40:28.837 --> 40:31.677
Suck out the venom? Tourniquet?

40:35.043 --> 40:37.072
Just old wives' tales.

40:42.383 --> 40:43.907
No.

40:44.787 --> 40:46.604
We won't.

40:52.794 --> 40:55.834
You... we can't die here.

41:45.883 --> 41:47.902
Can you reach it?

41:53.892 --> 41:55.428
Careful.

42:01.133 --> 42:02.450
Don't.

42:09.942 --> 42:11.828
Don't do anything stupid.

42:30.396 --> 42:32.281
You're gonna kill us both.

42:36.169 --> 42:38.293
Cut a hole in the side of the tent...

42:38.373 --> 42:41.067
...big enough for it to get out.
That's all it wants.

43:18.579 --> 43:20.225
Where is it?

44:27.818 --> 44:31.238
Is she sleeping, or is she dead?

44:38.363 --> 44:40.649
Is this really what life wanted for us?

44:44.203 --> 44:46.021
I don't know.

44:46.101 --> 44:47.960
You have to.

44:48.040 --> 44:50.722
You always have to know what you want.

44:55.480 --> 44:57.892
Life isn't all about how you die.

45:25.880 --> 45:27.631
Oh, Jesus.

45:34.938 --> 45:36.749
Do it.

45:38.359 --> 45:41.043
You know, in the heat, it'll be game over.

45:44.598 --> 45:46.434
Do it.

46:05.557 --> 46:07.350
Pierce it. Don't stab it.

46:07.690 --> 46:09.232
Can't.

46:27.876 --> 46:30.999
Please. Please, please.

46:31.079 --> 46:34.053
Get it... off me.

46:38.021 --> 46:41.041
Sorry. Could you just please get it off?

46:58.276 --> 46:59.864
Please.

47:00.344 --> 47:04.605
- Please just get it off me.
- Take its power away, hmm?

47:05.315 --> 47:07.912
You turn it into whatever works for you,
like with the spider.

47:07.992 --> 47:10.376
Fucking hate spiders.

47:10.756 --> 47:12.413
Then why are you here, then?

47:37.315 --> 47:39.133
I'm pregnant.

47:48.094 --> 47:49.645
Adam.

47:53.934 --> 47:55.819
How long have you known?

48:44.602 --> 48:46.149
Adam.

48:56.262 --> 48:58.919
Ah, there's gotta be something I'm missing.

49:07.210 --> 49:08.393
Matilda.

49:13.482 --> 49:15.371
The atropine.

49:15.751 --> 49:18.037
It might buy us some time...

49:19.522 --> 49:21.374
...if I get bitten.

49:24.562 --> 49:26.300
I don't see the bag.

49:33.237 --> 49:35.455
Did you leave it in the car?

49:38.972 --> 49:41.665
Pete said it must be something big
to get you out here.

49:41.745 --> 49:44.702
- Stop messing with my phone.
- How long have you known?

49:44.782 --> 49:47.271
Could you stop playing with my phone?

49:47.651 --> 49:49.505
The bag.

49:52.858 --> 49:54.801
Where is it?

50:01.199 --> 50:03.163
"Where's the bag, Adam?"

50:10.643 --> 50:12.531
Adam, where's the bag?

50:16.498 --> 50:18.488
Where did you put the bag?

50:19.418 --> 50:21.118
Adam.

50:21.554 --> 50:23.465
The bag.

50:27.292 --> 50:29.144
42 degrees.

50:31.796 --> 50:33.684
I told you the sun'd hit.

50:39.539 --> 50:41.429
The bag, Adam.

50:42.409 --> 50:44.461
The bag.

51:07.953 --> 51:09.837
Not knowing...

51:12.340 --> 51:14.138
...eats at you.

51:20.448 --> 51:22.207
Rip it.

52:02.259 --> 52:04.076
That beetle...

52:08.264 --> 52:10.718
...does it exist as a result of us...

52:13.303 --> 52:15.388
...or has it always been here?

54:10.559 --> 54:12.109
Adam.

54:22.070 --> 54:23.955
Will someone come?

54:26.676 --> 54:28.230
No.

54:29.410 --> 54:32.098
Pete'll be at the research hut in two days.

54:41.924 --> 54:44.815
- He's coming?
- Yeah.

54:46.095 --> 54:48.313
It's two days too late.

54:50.366 --> 54:52.823
When were you gonna tell me he's coming?

55:21.232 --> 55:23.289
We could gas it.

55:25.269 --> 55:28.720
There is a small chance
that it would go down before we do.

55:34.045 --> 55:37.850
Gas sinks, so if our heads are higher than...

55:38.550 --> 55:39.668
Gwynn.

56:02.041 --> 56:04.460
I'm gonna try and edge around him.

56:05.979 --> 56:07.821
If not...

56:07.901 --> 56:10.141
...you get out and go for the bag.

56:10.551 --> 56:12.506
Think it's at the top.

56:12.586 --> 56:15.762
- You'll have to climb.
- No way back, remember?

56:17.391 --> 56:19.209
There's always a way.

56:32.306 --> 56:35.032
- You'll find it.
- No.

56:36.645 --> 56:38.497
I want you to go.

56:43.651 --> 56:45.240
Call for help.

56:45.320 --> 56:47.449
Get the atropine.

56:47.529 --> 56:50.774
If not, you just keep going.

56:54.729 --> 56:56.707
You can't do this.

57:03.121 --> 57:04.973
You'll both live.

57:27.530 --> 57:29.080
Wait.

57:30.618 --> 57:32.004
Don't.

57:51.888 --> 57:53.537
Don't.

57:55.594 --> 57:57.408
I don't want...

57:57.996 --> 58:00.022
I don't want this.

58:02.633 --> 58:04.451
I don't want it.

58:14.196 --> 58:16.026
What did you do?

58:32.665 --> 58:34.723
It's not my baby, is it?

59:00.727 --> 59:02.248
I don't know.

59:07.667 --> 59:09.552
"I don't know."

59:15.742 --> 59:17.593
Where's my wife?

01:00:39.764 --> 01:00:41.319
Fuck!

01:01:52.073 --> 01:01:53.874
It was always you.

01:02:22.505 --> 01:02:24.306
It's slowing down.

01:02:28.310 --> 01:02:30.145
Let's go for the sleeping bag.

01:02:57.474 --> 01:02:59.030
Go.

01:03:00.810 --> 01:03:04.130
- Hold it!
- Oh, fuck. Shit!

01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:06.199
Adam!

01:03:10.221 --> 01:03:12.749
Okay. Okay.

01:03:18.895 --> 01:03:22.582
We need to cut our way out.
Where's the phone casing?

01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:26.724
Whoever gets bitten must stay calm.

01:03:26.804 --> 01:03:30.069
You elevate the bite.
You try not to get bitten again.

01:03:30.709 --> 01:03:32.730
The other one goes for the bag.

01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:35.261
I'm the better runner.

01:03:39.551 --> 01:03:41.275
Isn't that the truth.

01:03:44.455 --> 01:03:48.343
- What the fuck does he have that I don't?
- Please just hold it!

01:03:52.598 --> 01:03:54.649
I mean, would he do this?

01:03:55.535 --> 01:03:57.724
Would he die for you?

01:03:57.804 --> 01:04:00.055
I don't know. Would he try to kill me?

01:04:05.476 --> 01:04:07.363
Look at me.

01:04:10.082 --> 01:04:12.871
Ah, clearly we both deserve this, but what?

01:04:12.951 --> 01:04:15.643
I mean, I die so you can
just run back into his arms?

01:04:15.723 --> 01:04:18.802
- It's not like that.
- What is it like, exactly?

01:04:20.793 --> 01:04:22.650
Pete was right.

01:04:23.930 --> 01:04:25.985
This is our baby.

01:04:26.565 --> 01:04:28.423
- No.
- This is our baby.

01:04:28.503 --> 01:04:32.083
No, this isn't some mind game
you can just screw me with.

01:04:33.607 --> 01:04:36.826
- Nobody has to know.
- I know.

01:04:40.081 --> 01:04:41.898
I know.

01:04:46.887 --> 01:04:48.972
I knew I would break us.

01:04:51.892 --> 01:04:53.743
It was my fault.

01:05:00.301 --> 01:05:01.952
Look at you.

01:05:13.113 --> 01:05:15.132
Does that make me weak?

01:05:25.062 --> 01:05:27.083
Ah, fuck this.

01:05:27.763 --> 01:05:31.887
All right. I'm gonna shove
the little fucker in the corner.

01:05:31.967 --> 01:05:35.058
When I give the word, you open the door
and stay tucked up on the far side.

01:05:35.138 --> 01:05:36.900
I'll close the bag around it
and throw it out.

01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:40.029
Once it's out, it won't want
anything to do with us.

01:05:40.109 --> 01:05:42.961
Only then, you move.

01:05:45.682 --> 01:05:47.567
If I get bitten...

01:05:54.557 --> 01:05:56.675
...will you please come back?

01:06:16.768 --> 01:06:18.799
- Die!
- Gwynn!

01:06:20.348 --> 01:06:21.873
Gwynn!

01:06:21.953 --> 01:06:23.263
No!

01:06:26.002 --> 01:06:27.507
Gwynn!

01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:31.026
Oh, God.

01:06:59.059 --> 01:07:01.562
Keep your arm up! Okay, I'm coming back!

01:07:04.831 --> 01:07:06.682
Please help me.

01:07:34.930 --> 01:07:36.447
Shit.

01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:10.213
What? It's you.

01:12:44.518 --> 01:12:46.102
Damn!

01:12:50.068 --> 01:12:51.611
Fuck!

01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:50.071
Please.

01:15:14.975 --> 01:15:16.610
Please.

01:16:54.845 --> 01:16:57.296
Come on. Come on.

01:17:03.955 --> 01:17:06.572
Come on. Come on.

01:17:09.293 --> 01:17:10.456
God.

01:17:10.536 --> 01:17:12.412
Come on.

01:19:35.078 --> 01:19:36.286
No.

01:19:51.363 --> 01:19:54.052
No. No!

01:19:54.132 --> 01:19:56.617
No! You can't...

01:19:58.135 --> 01:19:59.986
...die for me.

01:20:04.910 --> 01:20:07.170
You take care of him for me.

01:20:09.248 --> 01:20:11.067
Promise me.

01:20:13.519 --> 01:20:15.757
Don't die for me!

01:20:16.922 --> 01:20:18.339
No.

01:20:38.546 --> 01:20:40.063
No.

01:21:02.469 --> 01:21:05.087
No. No.
