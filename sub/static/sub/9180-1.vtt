WEBVTT

02:19.472 --> 02:22.260
The Russians think
they own the world now.

02:22.308 --> 02:24.299
Especially those ones

02:34.654 --> 02:36.156
What, no town car?

02:36.656 --> 02:39.398
In our business,
it's better to be anonymous.

02:39.826 --> 02:42.158
I like town cars.

03:14.051 --> 03:15.510
Excuse me, sir.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
All right!

04:29.084 --> 04:32.086
I know, I know, I know. A gun.

04:32.171 --> 04:36.132
It is dangerous for no one except you.

04:36.216 --> 04:38.009
You know what I want, don't you?

04:38.093 --> 04:39.761
Yes, sir.

04:39.845 --> 04:43.222
You're wasting time. Don't fuck with me.

04:43.349 --> 04:45.641
Open it. Open it!

05:00.366 --> 05:02.158
Open it!

05:09.625 --> 05:11.334
Give me what I want.

05:11.418 --> 05:14.003
I don't understand.
I don't have andhing else.

05:14.088 --> 05:16.547
If a man's offering you
all that money, I'd take it.

05:16.632 --> 05:20.718
If I need financial advice,
I'll call my broker.

05:20.803 --> 05:22.261
- I'm just saying is all.
- Whatever.

05:22.388 --> 05:25.598
Take off your coat. Take off your coat!

05:36.026 --> 05:38.611
Now how hard was that?

05:38.695 --> 05:41.697
- Excuse me.
- Mister, I thought I told--

05:45.786 --> 05:46.953
What the--

05:52.418 --> 05:54.585
Don't do it! Move! Everybody down!

05:55.879 --> 05:58.381
Out of the way! Move!

05:58.465 --> 06:01.342
- Move! Get out of the way! Move!
- Get out of the way!

06:13.272 --> 06:14.689
Go, go, go, go.

06:15.607 --> 06:17.358
Desperate white or Hispanic male.

06:17.443 --> 06:20.027
Wearing a reflective vest.
He's on top of the cars.

06:20.112 --> 06:21.320
All units at Vernon Jackson.

06:23.949 --> 06:25.491
NYPD!

06:29.329 --> 06:31.080
Everybody down! Stay down!

06:33.125 --> 06:34.459
Other end!

06:50.184 --> 07:33.142
Move! Move!

07:33.227 --> 07:35.686
Everybody down!
Please get out of the platform now!

07:35.771 --> 07:37.980
Come on! Face down!
Everybody off the train!

07:38.065 --> 07:40.900
Everybody get down. Sir, get down.

07:40.984 --> 07:42.944
Is anything wrong?

07:43.028 --> 07:45.488
- Officer. Officer.
- Move! Move!

07:45.572 --> 07:47.490
Come on, guys, get down!

07:47.574 --> 07:49.408
Down! Get your ass down!

07:49.535 --> 07:51.118
Down! Get down!

07:51.203 --> 07:54.288
Search the track.
He went down the tunnel?

07:54.373 --> 07:56.582
Check the tunnel. Check the roofs!

08:03.131 --> 08:05.633
Come on, people.
Face down on the ground now.

08:05.717 --> 08:08.594
He jumped! He was on top of the roof.

08:08.679 --> 08:12.139
This train is closed! Nobody gets on!

08:12.224 --> 08:14.392
Sir, I need you to calm down.

08:14.476 --> 08:16.561
Get these people moving!

08:26.029 --> 08:27.488
Stop right there.

08:30.367 --> 08:32.618
The punk's got balls.

08:32.703 --> 08:34.996
But no positive identification.

08:35.080 --> 08:38.207
No. There's another camera
pointing at the platform.

08:44.298 --> 08:46.340
Michaels, stop it right there.

08:47.884 --> 08:49.260
You see what I see?

08:49.344 --> 08:51.846
- Maybe.
- That's him, Lieutenant.

08:51.930 --> 08:52.972
That's who?

08:53.056 --> 08:54.932
How long you been a detective, Michaels?

08:55.017 --> 08:56.017
11 months, sir.

08:56.101 --> 08:57.893
I'm 22 years in robbery homicide.

08:57.978 --> 09:01.188
One of your subcategories
of robbery is art theft.

09:01.273 --> 09:03.024
There's a lot of that in the Apple.

09:03.108 --> 09:04.609
Are you aware of that, Michaels?

09:04.693 --> 09:06.277
- I guess so, yeah.
- I wasn't.

09:06.361 --> 09:09.655
When I was your age, I was quite happy
with regular murder and mayhem.

09:09.740 --> 09:11.741
Lieutenant Weber minored
in art history at Fordham.

09:11.825 --> 09:12.825
Oh.

09:12.909 --> 09:15.870
Anyway, the Chief starts
calling me Lieutenant Picasso

09:15.954 --> 09:18.456
and puts me in charge
every time there is the theft

09:18.540 --> 09:20.708
of as much as an Etch-A-Sketch.

09:20.792 --> 09:23.878
2 decades I've been
putting 'em all away.

09:23.962 --> 09:26.881
Everybody but him-- Keith Ripley.

09:26.965 --> 09:29.008
He's the best there is.

09:29.092 --> 09:30.760
Howdy, Keith.

09:58.830 --> 10:01.832
You've been bad boy.

10:03.043 --> 10:06.671
- Perhaps I could give you 50.
- No.

10:06.755 --> 10:08.464
That is not possible.

10:08.548 --> 10:10.174
I wouldn't take less than 100.

10:10.258 --> 10:12.593
Oh, man.

10:12.678 --> 10:14.637
I'm just saying is all.

10:14.721 --> 10:16.222
You.

10:16.306 --> 10:18.516
Mind if I borrow this?

10:18.600 --> 10:20.976
Well, I may have wanted to use it.

10:21.061 --> 10:23.521
- Mm.
- But yours will do.

10:24.815 --> 10:26.190
Will you please put down my gun?

10:26.274 --> 10:28.859
There's one thing
you should be aware of, Gabriel.

10:28.944 --> 10:31.612
Or do you prefer Seá¿†or Martin?

10:31.697 --> 10:34.365
The police cannot arrest you
for armed robbery

10:34.449 --> 10:35.908
if your gun isn't loaded.

10:35.992 --> 10:37.201
Your point?

10:37.285 --> 10:39.912
You think I'd walk around
with a loaded shotgun?

10:39.996 --> 10:41.872
Let's see.

10:44.251 --> 10:45.793
You could have checked.

10:45.877 --> 10:49.380
Why? You have my diamonds,
my score, my money.

10:49.464 --> 10:52.883
Enjoy. Nice meeting you both. Bye.

10:52.968 --> 10:56.721
By the way, I was going to ask for 125.

10:57.723 --> 11:00.599
I'm just saying is all.

11:00.726 --> 11:01.934
Gabriel, stay.

11:02.018 --> 11:03.936
Why? What else do you want?

11:04.020 --> 11:06.897
You gonna shoot me now?

11:06.982 --> 11:09.191
Well, in as much as
you did steal the diamonds,

11:09.276 --> 11:12.319
I figure it's only fair
to share the proceeds with you.

11:12.404 --> 11:16.866
So to what do I owe
this act of generosity?

11:16.950 --> 11:20.035
I have a proposition
I wish to discuss with you.

11:23.915 --> 11:27.501
So, how did you know
I would come here,

11:27.586 --> 11:29.170
as well as my name?

11:29.254 --> 11:31.464
It's part of the proposition--

11:33.341 --> 11:34.884
Ah, shit.

11:36.344 --> 11:37.678
Come on.

11:37.763 --> 11:39.305
All right, take it easy, take it easy.

11:40.974 --> 11:42.683
Nicky would like his money.

11:44.269 --> 11:46.103
- Ask him.
- Thank you.

11:47.355 --> 11:51.358
This is something between you and them.
Got nothing to do with me! Aah!

11:51.443 --> 11:53.611
Everything does now.

11:55.781 --> 11:57.364
Call this interest.

11:57.449 --> 11:59.450
Nicky is tired of waiting for you.

12:09.795 --> 12:11.879
You must have very bad karma.

12:11.963 --> 12:13.756
I actually don't believe in it.

12:13.840 --> 12:15.508
Look, about this propos--

12:15.592 --> 12:17.134
No, no, no, no!

12:17.219 --> 12:19.011
You're totally out of your mind.

12:19.095 --> 12:20.596
Good night.

12:25.268 --> 12:26.852
- Hey.
- What?

12:26.937 --> 12:28.312
Here's your karma.

12:31.399 --> 12:33.275
What was in the other envelope?

12:34.444 --> 12:35.820
Your cut.

12:38.490 --> 12:40.282
Now you've got mine.

12:42.077 --> 12:43.661
Whatever.

12:43.745 --> 12:45.204
Think about it.

12:45.288 --> 12:46.705
Yeah, sure, yeah.

13:18.363 --> 13:20.906
Now what do you want?

13:22.576 --> 13:23.868
A partner.

13:25.203 --> 13:28.122
What did you think
I was doing on that train?

13:28.206 --> 13:29.582
I was watching you work.

13:30.876 --> 13:34.461
I've been your shadow
ever since you got to town.

13:34.546 --> 13:38.299
So why were you in my town
robbing subways?

13:38.383 --> 13:40.843
It's hurricane season in Miami.

13:40.927 --> 13:42.803
I don't like hurricanes.

13:42.888 --> 13:45.723
Or you didn't feel like
going back to Angola.

13:47.267 --> 13:48.601
It's over.

13:48.685 --> 13:50.603
- Lesson learned.
- Look.

13:50.687 --> 13:52.771
Gabriel Martin is a rock star.

13:52.898 --> 13:56.942
So why were you holding
open-mike night on the subway

13:57.027 --> 13:59.528
for a lousy hundred grand?

13:59.613 --> 14:01.363
2 reasons.

14:01.448 --> 14:03.991
Yes, Miami was getting too hot.

14:04.075 --> 14:06.493
And perhaps you can relate to this.

14:06.578 --> 14:08.913
Sometimes--

14:10.206 --> 14:13.083
Sometimes you just need to feel the rush.

14:15.545 --> 14:18.756
The juice. Yeah.

14:18.840 --> 14:20.591
You know what I mean.

14:21.718 --> 14:26.847
Yesterday you took down 2 jewelers
for a few stones from Romanov's.

14:26.932 --> 14:29.934
My idea is Romanov's itself.

14:31.061 --> 14:32.186
Please.

14:32.270 --> 14:37.983
Specifically, 2 Fabergé eggs
worth 20 million dollars...

14:38.068 --> 14:39.443
each.

14:41.821 --> 14:43.822
It's a 2-man job.

14:45.408 --> 14:47.743
Do I have your attention?

15:09.516 --> 15:10.975
Wait here.

15:12.644 --> 15:14.937
I hear they prefer cash.

15:15.021 --> 15:16.772
Or your first-born.

15:40.380 --> 15:43.132
Why don't you try The Standard instead?

15:47.262 --> 15:49.430
Jealous?

15:49.514 --> 15:50.848
Of who?

15:52.392 --> 15:54.226
The mystery bandit.

15:54.310 --> 15:57.688
I'm afraid that type of thing
is not my style.

15:57.772 --> 16:02.192
Well, I think this guy's got panache, guts.

16:03.486 --> 16:07.072
And a passing resemblance,
at least in body type.

16:08.533 --> 16:11.785
Well, you don't have to rob trains
to have panache.

16:11.870 --> 16:13.454
Or guts.

16:13.538 --> 16:16.582
But you've got to admit that kind of thing
immediately brands you.

16:16.606 --> 16:21.206
<says to Russian street vendor> I'd like to pay for the newspaper  please. Thank you "Spaceba" (means thank you in Russian)

16:21.254 --> 16:25.007
My treat. Too painful watching
you attempt to read Cyrillic.

16:25.091 --> 16:28.010
Oh, no, no, no. I was just, uh,
looking at the picture.

16:28.094 --> 16:29.678
So you are jealous.

16:31.264 --> 16:33.515
Yes. You got me there.

16:33.600 --> 16:34.683
Absolutely.

16:37.479 --> 16:40.731
I've got to get this Chinese food to my boss,

16:40.815 --> 16:44.860
so, um...some other time.

16:44.944 --> 16:46.278
When some other time?

16:46.362 --> 16:47.738
I'll call you.

16:47.822 --> 16:50.991
But you don't have my number
or know my name or anything.

16:51.076 --> 16:53.619
- I guess that could be a problem.
- Gabriel.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.997
- Oh, shit.
- Are you with him?

16:57.082 --> 16:59.208
I don't know. Should I? More or less.

16:59.292 --> 17:01.502
Uh, yes, I am.

17:01.586 --> 17:03.087
What do you want?

17:04.339 --> 17:06.757
Can't I bring my goddaughter
a birthday present?

17:06.840 --> 17:08.258
My birthday was last month.

17:08.343 --> 17:11.637
It was 2 weeks ago,
and I'm sorry it's late.

17:11.721 --> 17:14.640
Alex, it's just a present. No strings.

17:16.142 --> 17:17.184
No, thanks.

17:19.270 --> 17:21.688
Well, it was nice
to have almost met you, Gabriel.

17:21.772 --> 17:24.358
- Gaby.
- Gaby.

17:24.442 --> 17:27.819
It's a shame you don't keep
a higher class of company.

17:34.285 --> 17:36.411
Don't even think about it.

17:36.496 --> 17:38.122
Think about what?

17:38.206 --> 17:39.832
Going anywhere near her.

17:39.916 --> 17:41.375
I'll rip your heart out. I mean it.

17:41.459 --> 17:45.796
It looks like it's your heart
she's not so fond of.

17:45.880 --> 17:48.215
You were warned. Let's go.

17:48.299 --> 17:50.926
I thought you said the target
was Romanov's.

17:51.010 --> 17:52.845
This is research.

17:52.929 --> 17:53.971
Research?

17:54.055 --> 17:55.764
Oh, wow.

18:00.770 --> 18:03.147
They're absolutely stunning.

18:05.775 --> 18:07.693
They are.

18:07.777 --> 18:10.696
Between 1885 and 1916,

18:10.780 --> 18:13.949
Fabergé produced 50 of these
Easter eggs for the Empress

18:14.033 --> 18:16.535
and her daughter-in-law,
the Czarina Alexandra.

18:16.619 --> 18:18.203
Should I take notes?

18:18.288 --> 18:20.330
Will there be a quiz?

18:20.415 --> 18:23.667
No quiz, but there will be a test.

18:23.751 --> 18:25.419
Okay.

18:25.503 --> 18:29.464
The Fabergés are all made
of precious metals and fine jewels.

18:29.549 --> 18:32.092
Every one a unique masterpiece.

18:32.177 --> 18:33.260
Indeed.

18:33.344 --> 18:35.762
Most are on display in the Kremlin,

18:35.847 --> 18:39.600
the rest in private collections,
museums, or lost.

18:39.684 --> 18:43.145
In this case, at Romanov's.

18:43.229 --> 18:45.189
Who is your buyer?

18:45.273 --> 18:46.815
You don't want to know.

18:46.900 --> 18:50.277
Oh, I'm stealing 40 million dollars'
worth of eggs, so I want to know.

18:50.361 --> 18:52.988
I also want to know
why these particular eggs

18:53.072 --> 18:55.657
are even worth 40 million dollars.

18:55.742 --> 18:59.077
Because no one knows they exist.

18:59.204 --> 19:00.412
Oh.

19:00.496 --> 19:02.581
The so-called mystery eggs?

19:04.042 --> 19:08.045
Yeah, I've heard rumors,
but I thought it was just a myth.

19:08.129 --> 19:12.382
Last year, they turned up
at Romanov's.

19:12.467 --> 19:14.343
So how do you know this?

19:14.427 --> 19:18.972
I was partners with a man named
Victor Korolenko-- Alex' father.

19:19.057 --> 19:21.266
He was in tight with the Russians.

19:21.351 --> 19:24.144
What they knew, he knew.

19:24.229 --> 19:26.939
So, why aren't you
pulling this job with him?

19:27.023 --> 19:29.775
Let's just say he's no longer around.

19:29.859 --> 19:32.027
Leave it at that.

19:35.573 --> 19:38.075
He's gone.

19:38.159 --> 19:39.409
You're here.

19:40.954 --> 19:43.413
Now we just have to deliver.

19:45.583 --> 19:48.085
Ripley.

19:48.169 --> 19:50.087
Why?

19:50.171 --> 19:53.215
Why risk your freedom at all?

19:53.299 --> 19:55.300
This will not be anything close to easy.

19:55.385 --> 19:57.386
You are not in jail in the present.

19:57.470 --> 19:59.179
Are you not comfortable?

19:59.264 --> 20:00.931
I'm never comfortable.

20:02.141 --> 20:05.978
Some people were born to compose music,

20:06.062 --> 20:08.355
others to split the atom.

20:10.525 --> 20:13.277
I was born to steal shit.

20:15.697 --> 20:17.406
Hold out your hand.

20:18.741 --> 20:20.075
Hand?

20:24.789 --> 20:29.001
That coin was given to me by Victor
when we became partners.

20:29.085 --> 20:31.753
The coin represents a Russian phrase--

20:31.838 --> 20:33.672
Vorovoslky mir.

20:33.756 --> 20:37.884
Loosely translated, thieves' world.

20:37.969 --> 20:39.636
Victor belonged to it.

20:39.721 --> 20:44.182
Now...you belong to it.

21:22.347 --> 21:24.931
Psst. Hey.

21:25.016 --> 21:26.808
You misunderstand.

21:26.893 --> 21:28.727
Ripley's just, uh, business.

21:28.811 --> 21:30.604
This is, uh--

21:30.688 --> 21:32.189
Stalking?

21:33.608 --> 21:37.152
Well, if you had given me your number,
I would have called first.

21:38.363 --> 21:41.490
Those are 2 very flawed assumptions.

21:41.574 --> 21:42.908
Do you have a vase?

21:42.992 --> 21:45.327
I just took these
from a roadside shrine,

21:45.411 --> 21:48.080
and I think they need some, uh, water.

21:48.164 --> 21:52.584
Uh, may I use that, uh, thing over there?

21:52.668 --> 21:54.169
Yeah.

21:55.171 --> 22:00.384
I-- I've noticed this, uh, Russian nightclub
down the block--

22:00.468 --> 22:02.928
uh, Riga Rose or something like that.

22:03.012 --> 22:05.138
Why don't we meet there after work?

22:10.561 --> 22:12.187
I'm busy.

22:12.271 --> 22:14.147
I'll wait.

22:14.232 --> 22:16.191
I won't show.

22:16.275 --> 22:18.402
I'll take my chances.

22:21.572 --> 22:24.408
Do svidanja, Alexandra.

22:25.785 --> 22:27.285
Research. Keith Ripley.

22:27.412 --> 22:29.830
'93-- the Brooklyn Museum,

22:29.914 --> 22:31.832
'94-- the Diamond District Warehouse,

22:31.916 --> 22:33.041
and then in '95--

22:33.126 --> 22:36.503
I'm very familiar
with Ripley's life story, Michaels.

22:36.587 --> 22:39.965
In fact, I busted him twice.

22:40.049 --> 22:42.634
Both times he walked
because of good lawyering.

22:42.718 --> 22:45.512
Exactly, so I thought
why not swing for the fences?

22:45.596 --> 22:47.472
Murder 1, Victor Korolenko.

22:47.557 --> 22:50.517
Thinking of the Brighton Beach Steam Baths?
Forget it. There was no--

22:50.601 --> 22:52.436
No body, I know.
But we got a ton of forensics.

22:52.520 --> 22:54.396
- And no witnesses.
- Uh--

22:54.480 --> 22:56.523
Nobody there admitted to seeing a thing.

22:56.607 --> 23:00.193
I was this close to convincing Korolenko
to take witness protection

23:00.278 --> 23:02.404
in exchange for giving up Ripley.

23:02.488 --> 23:05.073
But Ripley got to him first.

23:05.158 --> 23:06.741
I can't prove it.

23:06.826 --> 23:09.119
Right, okay. I see, I see. Okay.

23:09.203 --> 23:11.872
No. What you don't see, Michaels,

23:11.956 --> 23:15.167
is why Ripley got involved
in a small-time caper

23:15.251 --> 23:18.420
like grabbing a few diamonds
off of some couriers on a subway.

23:18.504 --> 23:22.924
And neither did I
until I read the Dutch guy's statement.

23:23.009 --> 23:27.053
Those diamonds came from Romanov's.

23:27.138 --> 23:32.309
You mean, like, Ripley and his new partner
are planning to take down Romanov's?

23:32.393 --> 23:35.061
Ah, come on.
Like that could ever happen.

23:35.146 --> 23:37.022
Not even Ripley
could take down a place like that.

23:39.484 --> 23:41.151
Want to bet?

24:07.970 --> 24:10.222
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:10.306 --> 24:11.515
You know this place very well.

24:11.599 --> 24:13.600
I never said I didn't.

24:13.684 --> 24:15.977
And let's face it,
you didn't see the nightclub.

24:16.062 --> 24:19.814
You saw the flyer in the fax,
and then you made an assumption.

24:19.899 --> 24:23.026
Yeah. Guilty. So I did.

24:23.110 --> 24:27.113
Never assume andhing,
especially down here.

24:27.198 --> 24:29.032
How mysterious.

24:29.116 --> 24:30.450
What?

24:30.535 --> 24:32.327
How mysterious.

24:32.411 --> 24:34.829
- Can I buy you a drink?
- I don't drink.

24:34.914 --> 24:37.165
Another assumption.

24:38.960 --> 24:41.002
You want to dance?

24:44.340 --> 24:46.132
Yeah.

24:46.217 --> 24:48.468
I'm willing to make a fool of myself.

24:48.553 --> 24:50.053
Why not?

25:46.110 --> 25:48.278
Here.

25:48.362 --> 25:49.696
Spasiba.

25:49.780 --> 25:51.072
And for him.

25:51.157 --> 25:52.907
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

25:52.992 --> 25:54.868
I thought all Russians drank.

25:54.952 --> 25:58.413
Translation, we're a race
of suicidal alcoholics.

25:58.497 --> 26:00.582
No. I didn't mean that. No.

26:00.666 --> 26:02.167
Actually, we are.

26:02.251 --> 26:03.585
Cheers.

26:03.669 --> 26:05.086
Nastaravia.

26:05.171 --> 26:06.588
Nostrovia.

26:06.672 --> 26:08.006
Nostrovia?

26:09.342 --> 26:14.137
So, how is it, working for the lawyer?

26:15.556 --> 26:17.557
- I'm a lawyer, too, you know.
- Oh.

26:17.642 --> 26:21.686
Maybe I won't say another word
because everything I assume is wrong.

26:21.771 --> 26:24.939
- Well, you don't know until you try.
- True.

26:25.024 --> 26:28.068
Besides, my father warned me
about being a lawyer.

26:28.152 --> 26:31.571
He told me I should try and do
something honest with my life.

26:31.656 --> 26:33.615
As if he would know.

26:33.699 --> 26:37.118
Your father and Ripley,

26:37.203 --> 26:39.120
they were close, right?

26:40.790 --> 26:42.749
Once upon a time.

26:45.795 --> 26:48.546
I'm sure Ripley told you my father's dead.

26:49.965 --> 26:53.968
Now Ripley likes to try to take care of me,

26:54.053 --> 26:56.638
pay for stuff, that kind of thing.

26:56.722 --> 26:59.766
Of course, it's the least he can do.

26:59.850 --> 27:03.603
Sorry. I don't mean to pry.

27:09.485 --> 27:11.111
Yes, you do.

27:13.698 --> 27:17.117
Now who is making assumptions?

27:17.201 --> 27:21.788
No, Gaby. I'm not assuming a thing.

27:37.513 --> 27:39.806
You want to know about Ripley?

27:42.101 --> 27:43.727
Stay away.

28:22.975 --> 28:25.226
You son of a bitch.

28:26.937 --> 28:29.689
Well, you dropped these,

28:29.774 --> 28:33.443
and I am a gentleman
bringing them back to you.

28:40.284 --> 28:41.910
No, no, no.

28:44.330 --> 28:45.789
No.

29:35.673 --> 29:39.759
Oh! Shit, man! What do you want?

29:39.844 --> 29:42.846
I told you to leave her alone.

29:42.930 --> 29:45.682
I'm not gonna tell you again.

29:45.766 --> 29:49.102
Get dressed. I'll be downstairs.

29:56.861 --> 29:58.528
Son of a bitch.

30:03.033 --> 30:04.659
Fascinating.

30:06.412 --> 30:09.873
You could start a whole new trend
in interior design.

30:12.751 --> 30:14.043
What are these?

30:14.128 --> 30:15.420
What do they look like?

30:15.504 --> 30:16.838
Police lDs?

30:16.922 --> 30:22.218
There's a reception at Romanov's
tonight, honoring the NYPD.

30:22.303 --> 30:25.471
And our invitation's just arrived.

30:25.556 --> 30:26.806
A cop for the night.

30:26.891 --> 30:29.183
And all the doughnuts you can eat.

30:29.268 --> 30:32.312
Meanwhile, however,
I need you to go to the dry cleaners.

30:32.396 --> 30:36.149
Why don't you go and pick up
your dry cleaning yourself, sir?

30:36.233 --> 30:38.192
Who said andhing about picking up?

30:39.778 --> 30:41.529
You're dropping off.

30:55.920 --> 30:57.003
Hello.

31:20.861 --> 31:22.528
Cell phone, please.

31:46.905 --> 31:49.237
Come on, Sergeev,
we have as the Americans say...

31:49.616 --> 31:51.198
networking to go.

31:53.268 --> 31:54.268
Commissioner Rawls.

31:54.353 --> 31:55.395
- Sir.
- Gentlemen.

31:55.479 --> 31:57.063
Deputy Commissioner Morelli.

31:57.147 --> 31:59.232
Such a pleasure having you here.

31:59.316 --> 32:01.734
May we give you gentlemen
the grand tour?

32:01.819 --> 32:03.361
The secrets of Romanov?

32:03.445 --> 32:04.529
You might say so.

32:04.613 --> 32:06.447
- Thank you. We're honored.
- Please.

32:11.912 --> 32:14.664
The guards, all FSB secret police.

32:14.748 --> 32:18.084
Every door, every inch of glass
wired and alarmed.

32:18.168 --> 32:22.755
So even if a bird flies in here,
you know about it.

32:22.840 --> 32:24.340
Topkapi.

32:24.425 --> 32:25.967
Rififi.

32:26.051 --> 32:30.179
No. The bird flew into the museum,
landed on the wire,

32:30.264 --> 32:32.390
and set off the alarm in Topkapi.

32:32.474 --> 32:34.142
You're a cineaste.

32:34.226 --> 32:38.604
Actually, I only see heist movies.

32:38.689 --> 32:42.108
Well, the lesson to take away
from the bird flying into the museum

32:42.192 --> 32:46.988
is no matter how well you planned,
always be ready to improvise

32:47.072 --> 32:49.782
because I guarantee you,
something's gonna go wrong.

32:49.867 --> 32:52.201
I'd prefer to avoid that.

32:52.286 --> 32:55.663
How comprehensive
is the surveillance system?

32:55.748 --> 32:57.081
Let's take a look.

33:00.687 --> 33:03.304
Vault Level.
22 hours. Check.

33:03.648 --> 33:06.185
Vault Level.
22 hours. Check.

33:06.442 --> 33:07.477
Check.

33:19.104 --> 33:21.689
- Smart card for the elevator.
- And all the doors.

33:21.774 --> 33:22.774
This way. After you.

33:23.776 --> 33:24.984
We're on.

33:28.072 --> 33:30.239
Good to see you, old friend.
Let me introduce you.

33:31.241 --> 33:32.241
Nice to meet you.

33:32.326 --> 33:35.828
Lieutenant Weber, I presume.

33:35.913 --> 33:39.874
You know, Ripley,
identity theft is a serious crime.

33:39.958 --> 33:42.919
- And quite an embarrassing one in this case.
- Really?

33:43.003 --> 33:45.463
Do you realize how ashamed I felt

33:45.547 --> 33:48.257
telling that nice young lady at the door
that I was still a lieutenant?

33:48.342 --> 33:50.301
I mean at my age?

33:50.385 --> 33:52.095
Or should I say at your age?

33:52.179 --> 33:53.679
I'm not amused.

33:53.764 --> 33:55.264
What are you doing here?

33:55.349 --> 33:58.893
And why did you appropriate
my invitation? As if I didn't know.

33:58.977 --> 34:01.062
I apologize for the subterfuge.

34:01.146 --> 34:04.565
I just wanted to show my friend here
some of the finer things in life.

34:04.650 --> 34:08.360
Of course, if you want to arrest us
for impersonating police officers,

34:08.445 --> 34:09.529
go right ahead.

34:09.612 --> 34:11.614
I'm sure my lawyer
will have us out in 2 hours.

34:11.697 --> 34:14.951
It would be a delightful 2 hours.
Get your hands down.

34:15.034 --> 34:18.704
Then there's all that explaining
you'd have to do to your superiors.

34:18.789 --> 34:20.623
Now, that would be an embarrassment.

34:20.706 --> 34:25.128
Notorious thief gaining admittance
pretending to be you.

34:25.212 --> 34:27.045
Great police work, Weber.

34:27.130 --> 34:29.841
We should discuss my police work
when this is all over.

34:31.009 --> 34:33.136
Who's your sidekick?

34:33.219 --> 34:34.929
Jules Dassin.

34:35.013 --> 34:36.973
Good to meet you, Jules.

34:37.056 --> 34:39.516
I love your movies.

34:39.601 --> 34:43.688
Enjoy the party, gents, while it lasts.

34:45.690 --> 34:50.402
Now, do you mind telling me
what that was all about?

34:50.487 --> 34:52.280
Just a cop.

34:52.364 --> 34:54.031
Really? No kidding.

34:55.324 --> 34:59.579
We have been made in the very place
we are supposed to take down.

34:59.663 --> 35:01.914
Exactly how do you stay out ofjail?

35:01.999 --> 35:07.670
Unless, of course, you and this Weber
are partners trying to set me up.

35:08.714 --> 35:10.214
Are you, Ripley?

35:10.299 --> 35:12.091
The elevator, gentlemen.

35:12.176 --> 35:14.385
- Okay.
- Here we go.

35:14.469 --> 35:16.179
Come on. Move your damn ass.

35:20.350 --> 35:22.977
Weber has no idea what we're here for.

35:23.061 --> 35:24.395
Of course he does.

35:24.479 --> 35:26.898
He doesn't know when,
and he doesn't know how.

35:26.982 --> 35:28.816
And no, he doesn't know about the eggs.

35:28.901 --> 35:30.234
No one does. Here.

35:30.319 --> 35:32.153
The best way to neutralize Weber

35:32.237 --> 35:34.655
is to fuel his obsession with busting me.

35:34.740 --> 35:39.118
He is so blinded by it, he no longer
thinks like a cop. Trust me.

35:39.203 --> 35:41.454
Give me a good reason to, huh?

35:41.538 --> 35:44.707
I already gave you 40 million
good reasons. Here.

35:46.210 --> 35:49.462
Now that you've seen what the public sees,
it's time for the real treat.

35:49.546 --> 35:53.174
That is, of course, as long as you promise
not to come back and rob us.

35:53.258 --> 35:55.384
I guess I won't take any notes, then.

35:58.847 --> 36:00.848
Our main vault.

36:00.933 --> 36:03.142
Gregor, disarm the motion detectors.

36:03.227 --> 36:05.645
As you will see, even with
the knowledge of all protocols,

36:05.729 --> 36:07.897
it is absolutely impregnable.

36:07.981 --> 36:10.650
The voice sensors ask
our head of security, Boris Sergeev,

36:10.734 --> 36:13.527
a random set of pre-recorded words.

36:13.612 --> 36:16.572
But this is only half the process.

36:16.657 --> 36:20.910
We also have a biometric handprint sensor.

36:20.994 --> 36:24.372
Since Mr. Sergeev and I are
the only ones who have clearance,

36:24.456 --> 36:26.958
we must both be present to open the vaults.

36:27.042 --> 36:29.961
Once I activate
the biometric handprint sensor,

36:30.045 --> 36:32.338
he must activate the voice sensor.

36:32.422 --> 36:35.299
This way, neither of us
can steal from the other.

36:35.384 --> 36:38.636
Well, you better hope
Mr. Sergeev stays healthy.

36:38.720 --> 36:40.137
Yeah.

36:40.264 --> 36:42.223
I must stay healthy as well.

36:50.440 --> 36:51.399
Hamburger.

36:51.483 --> 36:55.152
Hamburger.

36:55.279 --> 36:56.988
Big Apple.

36:57.072 --> 36:58.489
Big Apple.

37:04.579 --> 37:07.373
Jesus Christ.

37:07.457 --> 37:10.793
The vault door automatically
resets on the hour,

37:10.877 --> 37:14.213
at which point the sensors
must be activated in reverse.

37:14.298 --> 37:18.050
All in all, gentlemen,
best not to get locked inside.

37:18.135 --> 37:20.594
Well, did I say it was gonna be easy?

37:20.679 --> 37:24.390
No, but you didn't say
it would be impossible, either.

37:24.474 --> 37:26.100
Armored glass.

37:26.184 --> 37:30.604
It would take a half an hour
to break through just one case.

37:30.689 --> 37:34.400
But I'm afraid whoever tried
wouldn't even have half a second

37:34.484 --> 37:38.195
because an ultrasonic motion detector
would automatically lock him in

37:38.322 --> 37:39.989
and trigger the alarm.

37:40.073 --> 37:41.574
Containment security, gentlemen.

37:41.658 --> 37:43.743
Getting in is highly improbable,

37:43.827 --> 37:46.162
but getting out is frankly impossible.

37:46.246 --> 37:47.747
Where does that door lead?

37:47.831 --> 37:51.375
To our inner vault, which contains
our most precious items.

37:51.460 --> 37:54.295
I'm sorry, but security prevents me

37:54.379 --> 37:56.130
from taking even this
distinguished group in there.

37:56.214 --> 37:58.341
Now we'll proceed back to the reception,

37:58.425 --> 38:00.760
but before we do,
I'd like to once again thank you both

38:00.844 --> 38:04.055
for your generosity this last year
in helping set up our business.

38:04.139 --> 38:06.307
And thank you very much
for the donation of that chopper.

38:06.391 --> 38:07.641
You're very welcome.

38:08.727 --> 38:11.520
Let's go. We can do this, Gabriel.

38:11.605 --> 38:14.607
No. Absolutely not.

38:14.691 --> 38:16.942
It was a pleasure. Goodbye.

38:17.027 --> 38:18.277
Wait a minute. Wait.

38:18.362 --> 38:21.322
Nobody's going anywhere yet.

38:21.406 --> 38:24.325
If Zykov finds that camera,
he's gonna know what it is.

38:24.409 --> 38:26.535
They'll change all the protocols.

38:26.620 --> 38:31.749
Which part of "I don't give a shit"
do you not understand?

38:49.142 --> 38:52.353
- Sorry. Let me just--
- I'll handle it.

38:52.437 --> 38:53.479
- I've got it. I've got it.
- No, no, no.

38:53.563 --> 38:55.898
Please, please. Allow me.

38:55.982 --> 38:57.817
- I'm absolutely okay.
- I apologize, sir.

39:37.607 --> 39:41.402
What the fuck?

39:41.486 --> 39:44.905
Detective Weber, I'm Hal Donley,
special agent in charge of this op.

39:44.990 --> 39:48.242
We understand you're conducting
an investigation of a potential theft

39:48.326 --> 39:50.411
that you assume is going down
at Romanov Jewelers.

39:50.495 --> 39:52.455
Assume, my ass.

39:52.539 --> 39:55.458
I know it's going down,
and I know who's pulling it off.

39:55.542 --> 39:58.335
Except we're asking you
to call off your dogs.

39:58.462 --> 40:00.463
There are other matters
that take precedence.

40:00.547 --> 40:02.548
What could possibly take precedence

40:02.632 --> 40:05.092
over the potential theft
of millions of dollars in diamonds

40:05.177 --> 40:10.556
from a company that donates tons
of money and equipment to the NYPD?

40:10.640 --> 40:12.558
Valentin?

40:12.642 --> 40:15.519
Vitaly Zykov, in the old Soviet days,

40:15.604 --> 40:18.606
was the right-hand man
to a party boss named Dimitri Kuzin.

40:18.690 --> 40:24.028
Kuzin set up a supposedly independent
Russian diamond center in America.

40:25.322 --> 40:26.489
Romanov's.

40:26.573 --> 40:30.201
But diamonds--

40:30.285 --> 40:31.911
they're not all
that he's shipping over here.

40:31.995 --> 40:34.079
He's ripping off
the Russian Treasury, Detective.

40:34.164 --> 40:37.124
Gold, gems, artworks.

40:37.209 --> 40:39.418
Gentlemen, where do you think
Romanov's got the money

40:39.503 --> 40:42.838
to buy your department a helicopter
and now police cars?

40:42.923 --> 40:44.798
From retail diamond sales?

40:44.883 --> 40:46.550
So why are they doing this?

40:46.635 --> 40:48.177
Is that a serious question?

40:49.888 --> 40:52.348
So the NYPD will leave them alone.

40:52.432 --> 40:54.850
That's their mindset.

40:57.521 --> 41:00.064
We need more time
to build our mutual cases.

41:00.148 --> 41:02.608
That's why we can't have
any other investigations

41:02.692 --> 41:04.735
potentially alerting Zykov.

41:09.366 --> 41:11.325
Lieutenant...

41:12.410 --> 41:13.702
shut it down.

41:15.747 --> 41:16.914
Gentlemen.

41:16.998 --> 41:18.874
Commissioner.

41:21.211 --> 41:23.921
Just in case you think
you're smarter than us,

41:24.005 --> 41:27.216
decide to continue this investigation
on a down and low,

41:27.300 --> 41:28.384
forget it.

41:28.468 --> 41:31.345
This is bigger than you and your ego.

41:31.429 --> 41:32.555
Do you get it?

41:33.765 --> 41:35.307
I get it.

41:38.728 --> 41:40.229
What did the feds have to say?

41:40.313 --> 41:43.816
Nothing. Everything's still a go.

41:43.900 --> 41:45.568
The first order of business

41:45.652 --> 41:47.987
is to bypass the security cameras.

41:48.071 --> 41:52.199
If we can gain access into
the surveillance system,

41:52.284 --> 41:55.703
we can replace the light feed
with a continuous loop of study shots

41:55.787 --> 41:57.830
with no face inside.

41:57.914 --> 42:02.543
That still leaves the voice sensors,
the fingerprints, the motion detectors,

42:02.627 --> 42:06.171
and the meanest-looking vault door
I have ever seen in my life.

42:27.402 --> 42:28.902
The inner vault door--

42:28.987 --> 42:31.322
Swiss-made, 3 feet thick,

42:31.406 --> 42:33.866
with spring-driven relocking bolts.

42:33.950 --> 42:37.077
If you punch out the lock,
they block retraction

42:37.162 --> 42:39.830
so that you couldn't open it
even if you knew the combination.

42:39.914 --> 42:42.124
Abraham Lincoln.

42:42.208 --> 42:43.584
Broadway.

42:43.668 --> 42:45.169
Broadway.

42:45.253 --> 42:46.837
30 pre-recorded words.

42:46.921 --> 42:48.422
One week, we've got them all.

42:48.506 --> 42:50.049
Dan McWilliams, MTA.

42:50.133 --> 42:52.051
Yes, we're going to be doing
some maintenance work

42:52.135 --> 42:54.845
in the subway adjacent
to your basement next week.

42:54.929 --> 42:59.433
We'll be working nights and didn't want
the drilling and what all to alarm you.

43:19.663 --> 43:22.456
You place an ultrasonic transducer here,

43:22.540 --> 43:26.377
broadcasting at the exact operating
frequency of the transmitter,

43:26.461 --> 43:29.505
and it bounces back
the frequency to the unit,

43:29.589 --> 43:31.090
at least in theory.

43:31.174 --> 43:33.801
Have you ever used
an ultrasonic transducer?

43:33.885 --> 43:35.010
Nope.

43:35.095 --> 43:37.721
Can you get an ultrasonic transducer?

43:37.806 --> 43:39.598
I can get anything, my friend.

43:39.683 --> 43:41.141
Can you get past a keypad?

43:41.226 --> 43:44.103
It is, as always, a question of time.

43:44.187 --> 43:45.979
One tumbler at a time.

43:46.064 --> 43:50.150
It is tight, but possible.

44:07.335 --> 44:08.419
You.

44:09.421 --> 44:11.171
Yeah.

44:11.256 --> 44:12.798
Me.

44:21.391 --> 44:23.267
What's so funny?

44:24.394 --> 44:26.770
I hate Chinese food.

44:26.855 --> 44:31.024
I absolutely, unequivocally,

44:31.109 --> 44:36.321
irrevocably loathe Chinese food.

44:36.406 --> 44:37.406
Oh.

44:37.490 --> 44:42.202
Leonid, my boss,
is addicted to Chinese food.

44:42.287 --> 44:45.080
- Oh.
- I can't even stand the smell.

44:45.165 --> 44:48.000
Another completely wrong assumption.

44:48.084 --> 44:50.419
No.

44:50.503 --> 44:53.046
It's not completely...

44:53.131 --> 44:54.256
wrong.

44:59.763 --> 45:00.763
What?

45:08.772 --> 45:09.980
Wow.

45:15.820 --> 45:18.071
You stole this.

45:18.156 --> 45:19.239
Yes, I did.

45:19.324 --> 45:20.991
- Didn't you?
- Yes.

45:21.075 --> 45:22.493
That's what I do.

46:07.038 --> 46:08.330
Wait.

46:41.072 --> 46:43.031
We have a problem.

46:44.576 --> 46:46.034
The bracelet?

46:47.495 --> 46:49.329
I cannot return it.

46:51.082 --> 46:54.042
No. I like it.

46:55.128 --> 46:58.547
So what could possibly be a problem?

46:58.631 --> 47:00.841
You.

47:00.925 --> 47:03.427
- What?
- Me.

47:03.511 --> 47:06.555
I thought that part was not a problem.

47:06.639 --> 47:08.599
And Ripley.

47:08.683 --> 47:10.225
That part is a problem.

47:11.227 --> 47:15.022
Yours and Ripley's
is a world I just can't trust.

47:18.401 --> 47:22.029
How did your father die?

47:22.113 --> 47:24.573
By gunshot.

47:24.657 --> 47:26.617
Who did it?

47:26.701 --> 47:31.496
He had gambling debts to a Russian
gangster named Nicky Petrovich.

47:33.416 --> 47:34.499
Nicky wants his money.

47:34.584 --> 47:35.868
Ask him.

47:36.252 --> 47:39.338
This concept of, uh, vorovosky...

47:39.422 --> 47:40.547
Vorovosky mir.

47:40.632 --> 47:42.466
Yes, I'm familiar with it.

47:42.550 --> 47:45.719
Where one is responsible
for the debts of another one.

47:45.803 --> 47:50.641
Uh, why would they kill your father
and let Ripley live?

47:50.725 --> 47:54.394
Because Ripley has-- I don't know.
How do you want me to put this?

47:54.479 --> 47:55.729
Earning power.

47:58.733 --> 48:01.526
Gaby,

48:01.611 --> 48:04.780
I don't want to go to any more funerals.

48:08.993 --> 48:11.119
I want to be with you,

48:11.204 --> 48:13.163
but I can't promise you that,

48:13.247 --> 48:16.583
and you can't promise me a thing,

48:16.668 --> 48:21.380
so maybe we shouldn't even try.

48:28.763 --> 48:31.431
Oh, you, you, you, you, you, you, you.

48:35.311 --> 48:36.687
Get in.

48:46.990 --> 48:49.116
I know you don't want to.
I know you don't mean to.

48:49.200 --> 48:50.450
But you will hurt her.

48:50.535 --> 48:53.412
She doesn't need any more of that.

48:53.496 --> 48:58.792
None of which you had
anything to do with. Am I right?

48:58.876 --> 49:01.253
Is there something you want to ask me?

49:03.339 --> 49:05.173
Yes.

49:05.258 --> 49:09.428
Why is Victor dead
and you're still walking around?

49:11.889 --> 49:16.435
I'm sure Alex told you that Victor was
in deep to a man named Nicky Petrovich.

49:16.519 --> 49:19.229
What she didn't know
was Nicky was ready to forgive the dept

49:19.313 --> 49:22.107
if Victor pulled a job-- this job.

49:22.191 --> 49:24.568
- Victor backed out?
- He was trying to protect Alex.

49:24.652 --> 49:26.153
Made a deal with Weber.

49:26.237 --> 49:28.447
He was gonna drop the dime on Nicky.

49:28.531 --> 49:29.823
And you.

49:29.907 --> 49:31.074
And me.

49:31.159 --> 49:33.660
Weber offered Victor witness protection--

49:33.745 --> 49:35.871
he and Alex, but Alex didn't want to go.

49:35.955 --> 49:38.999
Victor didn't want to go without her, so...

49:39.083 --> 49:41.084
he bought a bullet instead.

49:41.169 --> 49:42.836
So then why is this still your problem?

49:42.920 --> 49:45.255
Why don't you just leave?

49:45.339 --> 49:49.426
You don't make a deal with Nicky Petrovich
and then walk away.

49:49.510 --> 49:51.344
There's no statute of limitations.

49:51.429 --> 49:53.847
Nicky wants those eggs.

49:53.931 --> 49:55.891
Victor's share
would have paid off his debt.

49:57.643 --> 49:59.352
Victor and I were partners.

49:59.437 --> 50:01.104
He was responsible for me.

50:01.189 --> 50:04.858
So now I'm responsible for him and his debt.

50:06.110 --> 50:08.278
Bullshit.

50:08.362 --> 50:10.197
Victor is dead. Just walk away.

50:10.281 --> 50:13.200
- That's not an option.
- Oh, wow. This is just--

50:14.452 --> 50:15.619
Look.

50:17.246 --> 50:18.914
We do the job.

50:18.998 --> 50:20.749
Nicky gets his cut.

50:20.833 --> 50:22.209
I take a small chunk,

50:22.293 --> 50:25.045
nowhere near commensurate
with my risk,

50:25.129 --> 50:27.130
and you clear a cool 20 million.

50:27.215 --> 50:30.092
I don't know. This is--

50:30.176 --> 50:33.512
Look, either we pull this job off flawlessly,

50:33.596 --> 50:36.431
or you call Weber
and you ask for witness protection,

50:36.516 --> 50:38.475
which isn't a choice at all

50:38.559 --> 50:40.936
because Nicky will find you,
and he will kill you.

50:41.020 --> 50:44.773
It doesn't matter where you go
or how long it takes.

50:44.857 --> 50:47.109
That's an unalterable fact.

50:55.368 --> 50:57.536
Well, uh...

51:01.541 --> 51:04.501
then we steal the fucking eggs.

51:04.585 --> 51:05.836
No?

51:05.920 --> 51:08.046
Yes.

51:11.008 --> 51:12.884
Oh, shit.

51:13.761 --> 51:16.304
All right, we are working on it, mami culos,

51:16.389 --> 51:19.057
so back off, please. Thank you.

51:19.142 --> 51:21.601
I think he called us a name.

51:23.187 --> 51:25.981
We do not like to be insulted.

51:27.984 --> 51:29.442
All right.

52:48.648 --> 52:52.108
Do you know the significance
of this coin?

52:52.235 --> 52:54.486
Yeah.

52:56.489 --> 53:00.992
Then you must know, by the mere fact
that you have it in your possession,

53:01.077 --> 53:05.830
I cannot assume the two of you
will not attempt to double-cross me.

53:05.915 --> 53:10.001
Nobody's gonna try to double-cross you,
Nicky. We've been trying to--

53:12.046 --> 53:14.047
Nicky.

53:16.259 --> 53:18.218
- Alex, I'm so sorry.

53:18.302 --> 53:20.762
Yeah, well, we're all sorry, aren't we?

53:20.846 --> 53:23.390
There's no reason
for you to bring her here.

53:23.474 --> 53:27.227
The fact that you gave that coin to him

53:27.311 --> 53:29.938
tells me there are many reasons,

53:30.022 --> 53:32.232
but only one I care about.

53:32.316 --> 53:34.276
Why would we try to betray you?

53:34.360 --> 53:40.240
Well, Ripley, in your case, perhaps,
a misguided sense of revenge.

53:40.324 --> 53:43.410
His, perhaps, simply greed.

53:43.494 --> 53:45.996
It doesn't matter.

53:46.080 --> 53:48.832
I will not take the chance
of the two of you

53:48.916 --> 53:53.086
taking what is rightfully mine
and selling it to the highest bidder.

53:54.797 --> 53:58.633
Please, excuse me, Mr. Petrovich.

53:58.718 --> 54:00.885
Will you, please? Thank you.

54:00.970 --> 54:05.557
Where is it written
that these eggs are yours?

54:08.769 --> 54:11.855
Because they belong to my family.

54:11.939 --> 54:17.068
Because my great-grandfather
made them.

54:17.153 --> 54:19.279
Yes, Ripley.

54:19.363 --> 54:21.031
Evgenly Petrovich made them.

54:24.910 --> 54:30.248
He made the 1917 mystery eggs.

54:30.333 --> 54:33.293
I will have those eggs.

54:33.377 --> 54:36.755
And you will get them for me.

54:36.839 --> 54:41.843
That's why I bring Alexandra here.

54:41.927 --> 54:45.347
To keep me company while you do
what you need to do.

54:47.183 --> 54:48.725
Go.

54:54.357 --> 54:59.110
Anyone try to follow us, she dies.

54:59.195 --> 55:01.279
If there are police, she dies.

55:02.782 --> 55:07.494
If I don't get what I want...she dies.

55:09.997 --> 55:11.289
Go.

55:11.374 --> 55:13.458
There is a subway, not far.

55:17.797 --> 55:20.507
Damn you, Gabriel.

55:20.591 --> 55:22.425
I told you not to get her involved.

55:22.510 --> 55:24.511
You told me? You told me?

55:24.595 --> 55:27.764
You and her father got her involved
even before she was born.

55:27.848 --> 55:29.182
God damn it!

55:29.266 --> 55:30.725
We go tomorrow.

56:50.365 --> 56:52.151
I heard a noise.

56:53.076 --> 56:54.237
What noise?

56:55.161 --> 56:57.323
- You don't hear it?
- No.

56:57.705 --> 56:59.912
Permission to investigate? Over.

57:00.166 --> 57:01.247
Wait.

57:01.918 --> 57:02.544
Gregor.

57:02.585 --> 57:04.087
Negative for the noise.

57:04.129 --> 57:09.169
Log book says
MTA's doing subway maintenance.

57:09.843 --> 57:11.129
Maintenance?

57:11.678 --> 57:14.966
Yes, in subway.
Keep us posted. Out.

57:15.014 --> 57:16.550
Vault Level. Cut.

57:44.235 --> 57:46.819
How much time?

57:46.904 --> 57:49.197
Just over 3 minutes
until the 2200 hour check.

58:30.673 --> 58:32.789
Vault Level.
22 hours. Check.

58:33.843 --> 58:36.084
Vault Level.
22 hours. Check.

59:04.207 --> 59:06.665
Zone 47. Basement stairwell door

59:06.709 --> 59:08.211
That can't be the MTA.

59:11.130 --> 59:13.121
I'm sending Gregor to check it out.

59:14.300 --> 59:15.802
Vault Level, come in.

59:17.470 --> 59:18.972
Vault Level.

59:19.389 --> 59:21.756
Check out the alarm in the basement.

59:22.392 --> 59:23.848
On my Way-

59:44.706 --> 59:46.447
False alarm All clear.

01:00:06.519 --> 01:00:08.305
Tell them everything's okay.

01:00:14.134 --> 01:00:16.135
Smart card.

01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:17.929
Come on, come on!

01:00:21.433 --> 01:00:22.600
Let's go.

01:00:33.254 --> 01:00:34.756
He's taking his time.

01:00:40.178 --> 01:00:42.385
This is becoming quite boring.

01:00:46.392 --> 01:00:47.644
What is that?

01:00:48.127 --> 01:00:50.044
Porno?

01:00:50.271 --> 01:00:51.648
Happy birthday, Artur.

01:00:52.482 --> 01:00:54.223
Gregor, it's not my birthday.

01:00:54.567 --> 01:00:56.069
It's not?

01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:05.033
Someone has delivered
this birthday cake for Artur.

01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:06.660
It's not my birthday.

01:01:06.704 --> 01:01:09.913
My mistake. I thought it was the 23rd.

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:13.746
I left my walkie in the basement.
Permission to retrieve?

01:01:14.128 --> 01:01:16.665
Make it fast, Gregor.
This is not amusing.

01:01:58.923 --> 01:02:00.630
This is good cake.

01:02:02.677 --> 01:02:04.167
You should have
a birthday more often.

01:02:48.539 --> 01:02:50.122
Rasputin.

01:02:53.252 --> 01:02:55.294
Rasputin.

01:02:55.379 --> 01:02:56.963
17.

01:02:59.007 --> 01:03:00.424
17.

01:03:00.509 --> 01:03:02.468
Norway.

01:03:02.553 --> 01:03:05.221
Norway.

01:03:12.104 --> 01:03:14.021
Fuck.

01:03:14.106 --> 01:03:16.023
It wants to know if I'm hungry.

01:03:16.108 --> 01:03:17.358
Are you?

01:03:26.410 --> 01:03:27.410
Nyet.

01:04:17.419 --> 01:04:18.419
All right.

01:04:18.503 --> 01:04:20.630
Wait, wait, wait.

01:04:28.305 --> 01:04:29.722
Go.

01:04:36.021 --> 01:04:37.355
Stop.

01:04:37.439 --> 01:04:38.940
Go right.

01:04:41.985 --> 01:04:45.529
Right.

01:04:45.614 --> 01:04:47.365
Stop.

01:04:47.449 --> 01:04:48.532
Good.

01:04:48.617 --> 01:04:55.206
Straight ahead.

01:04:55.290 --> 01:04:58.459
Go, go, go, go, go.

01:04:58.543 --> 01:04:59.961
Stop. Flatten out.

01:05:00.045 --> 01:05:01.837
Head down, head down, head down.

01:05:03.382 --> 01:05:07.802
Okay. Now diagonally left.

01:05:07.886 --> 01:05:09.303
Diagonally to the left.

01:05:14.601 --> 01:05:15.601
Keep going.

01:05:15.686 --> 01:05:17.269
Left.

01:05:17.354 --> 01:05:19.814
Get your arm in. No, arms!

01:05:19.898 --> 01:05:22.316
- Flat. Down.
- Oh, shit.

01:05:22.401 --> 01:05:24.986
Okay. Straight ahead.

01:05:30.158 --> 01:05:32.159
Go, go, go, go, go.

01:05:32.244 --> 01:05:33.995
Go, go.

01:05:38.709 --> 01:05:39.875
Stop. Stop.

01:05:41.503 --> 01:05:43.087
Deploy.

01:05:51.763 --> 01:05:53.431
Hurry.

01:06:06.862 --> 01:06:07.987
Stop. Stop. Flat.

01:06:08.071 --> 01:06:09.071
Flat!

01:06:11.742 --> 01:06:13.034
Okay, hurry.

01:06:21.835 --> 01:06:23.711
Quick as you can.

01:06:27.090 --> 01:06:28.549
Good.

01:06:36.099 --> 01:06:37.850
It's working. Let's go.

01:07:02.667 --> 01:07:05.002
Hold it, hold it, hold it!

01:07:07.756 --> 01:07:09.924
- Lead.
- Okay.

01:07:10.008 --> 01:07:11.300
Let's take a look.

01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:29.693
When? Shit!

01:07:29.778 --> 01:07:30.778
All right, sit tight.

01:07:30.862 --> 01:07:32.071
We're on our way.

01:07:32.155 --> 01:07:34.573
Yes, I owe you.

01:07:34.658 --> 01:07:37.118
They're having a sale at Romanov.

01:07:37.202 --> 01:07:39.411
- Sir?
- That was my plant.

01:07:39.496 --> 01:07:41.872
Unexplained alarm went off
about an hour ago.

01:07:41.957 --> 01:07:44.041
I want all available units
in the garage now.

01:07:44.126 --> 01:07:46.627
Vouti and Michaels,
have them meet us at the staging area.

01:07:46.711 --> 01:07:49.004
- Yes, sir.
- Now it's my turn.

01:07:59.224 --> 01:08:01.350
We're good.

01:08:05.438 --> 01:08:07.022
All right.

01:08:12.028 --> 01:08:14.697
Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.

01:08:14.781 --> 01:08:16.448

01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:19.160
- Okay, a little more.

01:08:19.243 --> 01:08:21.120
Come on, a little more.
A little more, little more.

01:08:21.203 --> 01:08:23.247
Come on. More, more, more.

01:08:23.331 --> 01:08:25.666
More, more, more.
Stop! Okay.

01:08:25.750 --> 01:08:27.251
Right there.

01:08:29.504 --> 01:08:32.131
- All right.
- Good job.

01:08:32.215 --> 01:08:34.508
1 .

01:08:34.593 --> 01:08:37.511
No.

01:08:37.595 --> 01:08:39.095

01:08:40.098 --> 01:08:42.765
No. 3.

01:08:42.850 --> 01:08:44.643
No. 4.

01:08:48.189 --> 01:08:49.982
Hold-- That's it.

01:08:50.066 --> 01:08:51.192
4, 1 .

01:08:52.694 --> 01:08:53.736
No.

01:08:53.819 --> 01:08:56.322
4, 2.

01:08:56.406 --> 01:08:58.157
No. 4, 3.

01:08:59.826 --> 01:09:01.660
No. 4, 4.

01:09:02.545 --> 01:09:04.622
No.

01:09:04.706 --> 01:09:06.207
4, 5.

01:09:08.710 --> 01:09:10.044
Bingo.

01:09:12.464 --> 01:09:13.923
Go, Sergeant! Let's go!

01:09:14.006 --> 01:09:15.341
- Yes, sir.
- Sometime tonight.

01:09:15.425 --> 01:09:16.841
How about it?

01:09:16.926 --> 01:09:18.761
- All right.
- All right.

01:09:18.845 --> 01:09:22.348
4, 5, 6, 1, 2.

01:09:23.475 --> 01:09:25.725
Got it. Got it.

01:09:25.810 --> 01:09:31.314
4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3.

01:09:31.399 --> 01:09:33.901
No.

01:09:33.984 --> 01:09:38.404
4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 4.

01:09:38.490 --> 01:09:40.198
No.

01:09:40.283 --> 01:09:41.951
4, 5, 6, 1...

4, 5, 6, 1-- I know.

01:09:43.662 --> 01:09:45.412

01:09:45.497 --> 01:09:47.206
No.

01:09:47.290 --> 01:09:49.124
Damn it.

01:09:49.251 --> 01:09:54.421
4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 6.

01:09:55.548 --> 01:09:58.259
Bingo. Okay. Okay.

01:10:02.055 --> 01:10:04.890
4, 5, 6, 1...

01:10:04.975 --> 01:10:09.353
2, 6, 1.

01:10:11.690 --> 01:10:12.731
1.

01:10:14.609 --> 01:10:19.113
Come on.

01:10:19.197 --> 01:10:21.365
What the fuck are you doing?

01:10:21.449 --> 01:10:23.575
lmprovising.

01:10:38.091 --> 01:10:39.925
Shit.

01:10:40.010 --> 01:10:42.469
- Take this shit off.
- Careful.

01:10:42.554 --> 01:10:44.763
Let's go. Come on.
Move around this guy.

01:10:44.848 --> 01:10:46.098
Move those guys out of the way.

01:10:46.182 --> 01:10:48.142
Come on! Go through the lights!

01:11:46.576 --> 01:11:48.369
There.

01:11:50.914 --> 01:11:53.665
See if you can move these boxes.

01:11:57.379 --> 01:11:58.379
All right.

01:12:24.989 --> 01:12:26.240
Okay.

01:12:50.515 --> 01:12:51.932
What are you doing?

01:12:52.016 --> 01:12:53.016
Give me the box.

01:12:54.477 --> 01:12:56.603
- Gabriel, don't do this.
- Give me the box.

01:12:58.148 --> 01:12:59.273
What, you want more money?

01:12:59.357 --> 01:13:00.524
Hell, man, look around you.

01:13:00.608 --> 01:13:03.986
- Take what you want.
- Oh, shut up and give me the box.

01:13:05.155 --> 01:13:06.196
What about Alex?

01:13:06.281 --> 01:13:07.990
Nicky will kill her. You know that.

01:13:08.074 --> 01:13:10.826
I will ask you one more time.

01:13:11.911 --> 01:13:14.913
Why are you doing this?

01:13:14.998 --> 01:13:16.331
I'm a cop.

01:13:18.668 --> 01:13:20.419
In Miami for the last 10 years.

01:13:20.503 --> 01:13:23.255
Weber requested me, just for you.

01:13:27.010 --> 01:13:29.136
So you're a cop.

01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:30.929
You want to arrest me? Go ahead.

01:13:31.014 --> 01:13:32.431
Where am I gonna go?

01:13:32.515 --> 01:13:34.600
But in one minute,
that vault door's gonna lock,

01:13:34.684 --> 01:13:38.353
and we'll be stuck in here,
and Alex is gonna be dead.

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:41.273
I can't believe you're such
a contemptible human being

01:13:41.357 --> 01:13:43.942
that you would use her like that
and then just kill her

01:13:44.027 --> 01:13:46.487
because you might as well
be pulling the trigger yourself.

01:13:46.571 --> 01:13:50.407
Simply to bag the great Keith Ripley.

01:13:50.575 --> 01:13:54.328
You sorry, sick motherfucker.

01:13:57.248 --> 01:13:58.373
You got 30 seconds.

01:13:58.500 --> 01:13:59.666
How do I find Nicky?

01:14:01.127 --> 01:14:03.879
- Phone number in my pocket.
- Give it to me.

01:14:03.963 --> 01:14:06.507
And the eggs.

01:14:06.591 --> 01:14:08.884
Do you want her alive or not?

01:14:08.968 --> 01:14:10.677
Do you?

01:14:23.441 --> 01:14:25.150
10 seconds.

01:14:26.569 --> 01:14:27.861
I'm sorry.

01:14:33.785 --> 01:14:35.160
Come on.

01:14:57.433 --> 01:14:58.684
Underground, boys.

01:14:58.768 --> 01:15:00.686
All right, let's move! Come on!

01:15:10.464 --> 01:15:12.580
Security Desk to Vault Level. Over.

01:15:15.677 --> 01:15:18.089
Security Desk to Vault Level. Over.

01:15:20.557 --> 01:15:22.764
Bodgan, check out the elevator.
Immediately.

01:15:48.610 --> 01:15:50.402
I'm a police officer!

01:15:50.486 --> 01:15:51.862
Listen to me.

01:15:51.946 --> 01:15:53.947
There is a thief
locked in your inner vault.

01:15:54.032 --> 01:15:56.366
The guard is in the basement closet.

01:15:56.451 --> 01:15:58.452
Move! Move, move, move!

01:15:58.536 --> 01:15:59.995
Move out of there!

01:16:00.079 --> 01:16:01.830
Now! Move!

01:16:01.914 --> 01:16:03.165
Come on!

01:16:03.249 --> 01:16:05.417
Tell them to put their weapons down now.

01:16:06.836 --> 01:16:08.503
Now!

01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:09.755
- Aah!
- Okay.

01:16:09.839 --> 01:16:11.214
Fine.

01:16:14.177 --> 01:16:15.552
Put them down.

01:16:15.637 --> 01:16:17.012
Now!

01:16:22.226 --> 01:16:24.227
Kick them, now!

01:16:26.981 --> 01:16:27.981
What do you want?

01:16:29.233 --> 01:16:32.569
You let me out the front door
so I can rejoin my unit.

01:16:32.654 --> 01:16:34.613
They have the building surrounded.

01:16:34.697 --> 01:16:38.325
Meantime, you go downstairs,
you find your thief and your comrade.

01:16:38.409 --> 01:16:39.951
- You understand?
- That door is alarmed.

01:16:40.036 --> 01:16:42.621
- I can't just open it.
- You have a problem, solve it.

01:16:42.705 --> 01:16:45.082
Do not make me shoot this man, please.

01:16:55.093 --> 01:16:56.593
Aah!

01:17:24.372 --> 01:17:25.997
Put down your weapons.

01:17:26.082 --> 01:17:27.332
- We are police!
- Yeah?

01:17:27.417 --> 01:17:30.168
Everybody's police tonight.

01:17:36.926 --> 01:17:39.886
- Hello?
- Hey, I have what you want.

01:17:39.971 --> 01:17:41.096
No, it's just me.

01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:46.484
We have these 'police'
in the conference room.

01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:48.202
Keep them there for now.

01:18:02.618 --> 01:18:04.035
Can we talk?

01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:06.830
I have a proposition for you.

01:18:18.217 --> 01:18:19.801
Where is she?

01:18:23.347 --> 01:18:25.932
Do not move.

01:18:26.017 --> 01:18:28.602
He has a gun behind the box.

01:18:28.686 --> 01:18:29.770
Bad boy.

01:18:29.854 --> 01:18:33.106
Give me the box and give Andrei
your weapon, please.

01:18:33.191 --> 01:18:34.900
- We don't wish trouble here.
- No, no, no, no.

01:18:34.984 --> 01:18:36.359
You don't understand.

01:18:36.444 --> 01:18:40.030
You let her go, then I'll give you the box.

01:18:40.114 --> 01:18:42.949
You see, if I fire through this box,

01:18:43.034 --> 01:18:45.494
which I have no problem doing
whatsoever,

01:18:45.578 --> 01:18:47.162
Nicky's not gonna be very happy.

01:18:47.246 --> 01:18:49.748
Then we are all expendable.

01:18:49.832 --> 01:18:52.626
If you actually understand
the meaning of the word.

01:18:52.710 --> 01:18:54.252
Open the box.

01:18:55.546 --> 01:18:57.881
Lower the gun. Lower the gun.

01:18:57.965 --> 01:18:59.883
Lower it.

01:19:04.806 --> 01:19:06.097
Okay.

01:19:13.815 --> 01:19:15.273
You all right?

01:19:15.358 --> 01:19:17.484
Yeah. I'm just lovely, thanks.

01:19:17.568 --> 01:19:19.820
You go.

01:19:27.745 --> 01:19:29.079
Give me the box.

01:19:32.208 --> 01:19:34.543
- Get in.
- Why?

01:19:34.627 --> 01:19:36.336
Nicky wants to see you.

01:19:38.422 --> 01:19:39.923
Give me your weapon.

01:19:41.425 --> 01:19:42.968
We're fine, right?

01:19:52.311 --> 01:19:55.230
Where do you get off detaining us?

01:19:55.314 --> 01:19:56.898
My apologies, Lieutenant Weber.

01:19:56.983 --> 01:19:59.818
My security were,
understandably, confused.

01:19:59.902 --> 01:20:02.696
Please go with Mr. Sergeev
down to the vault.

01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:04.906
We have what you want. Please.

01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:16.459
Where's the other one?

01:20:16.544 --> 01:20:17.544
Nobody else.

01:20:17.628 --> 01:20:18.920
Just him.

01:20:19.005 --> 01:20:20.714
Where the hell's my man?

01:20:21.799 --> 01:20:27.262
Lieutenant, your personal life--
none of my business.

01:20:28.598 --> 01:20:32.559
I apologize for bringing you here,

01:20:32.643 --> 01:20:35.353
but I had to be sure the eggs were genuine

01:20:35.438 --> 01:20:37.105
before I let you go.

01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:42.027
Your lack of trust is really depressing,
Mr. Petrovich.

01:20:43.362 --> 01:20:45.614
I'm a man of my word.

01:20:47.366 --> 01:20:50.118
She should be with her godfather now.

01:20:52.663 --> 01:20:54.289
Let's see.

01:20:55.333 --> 01:20:57.584
- Do you mind?
- Sure, call.

01:21:05.593 --> 01:21:06.593
Yeah.

01:21:11.807 --> 01:21:14.392
- Hello?
- Hey. Where are you?

01:21:15.603 --> 01:21:16.937
I'm at the jail.

01:21:17.021 --> 01:21:20.148
- I had to see him.
- How is he?

01:21:20.232 --> 01:21:21.524
Well, how do you think he is?

01:21:21.609 --> 01:21:23.944
I had no choice, Alex.

01:21:24.028 --> 01:21:25.612
No one had a choice.

01:21:25.696 --> 01:21:27.447
Remember?

01:21:27.531 --> 01:21:28.531
I told you.

01:21:28.616 --> 01:21:30.951
Neither one of us could promise a thing.

01:21:31.035 --> 01:21:34.287
Listen, promises blow away
in the wind,

01:21:34.372 --> 01:21:36.247
but feelings are real.

01:21:36.332 --> 01:21:38.291
And I need to know

01:21:38.376 --> 01:21:40.418
were the feelings lies, too?

01:21:40.503 --> 01:21:41.920
Listen, listen.

01:21:42.004 --> 01:21:43.088
What I mean is...

01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:45.632
are we real?

01:21:47.385 --> 01:21:48.551
Um...

01:21:51.472 --> 01:21:54.182
I've got to go, Gabriel.

01:21:54.266 --> 01:21:55.266
Good night.

01:21:55.351 --> 01:21:56.476
Hey, don't--

01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:58.103
Hold--

01:22:06.362 --> 01:22:08.405
Are you satisfied?

01:22:17.081 --> 01:22:19.624
Did you see them?

01:22:19.709 --> 01:22:22.252
Actually, we were in a hurry.

01:22:22.336 --> 01:22:23.920
Look.

01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:35.890
They are simply...

01:22:36.017 --> 01:22:37.475
wood?

01:22:55.494 --> 01:22:57.495
Oh, my God.

01:22:57.580 --> 01:22:59.289
Simply wood?

01:23:03.044 --> 01:23:05.545
It was 1917, Gabriel.

01:23:05.629 --> 01:23:06.713
Russia.

01:23:06.797 --> 01:23:08.214
People were starving.

01:23:08.299 --> 01:23:12.343
There were no jewels, no diamonds left.

01:23:12.428 --> 01:23:14.721
No hope.

01:23:14.805 --> 01:23:18.516
Yet Czarina Alexandra
had to have her eggs.

01:23:20.561 --> 01:23:24.731
Perhaps you understand
why we had that revolution.

01:23:24.815 --> 01:23:28.485
People needed to believe in something.

01:23:30.738 --> 01:23:32.697
Take him home.

01:23:38.913 --> 01:23:39.913
Gabriel.

01:23:43.793 --> 01:23:48.546
I know what they say about me,
but I'm not a killer.

01:23:48.631 --> 01:23:52.008
Merely a humble immigrant.

01:23:52.093 --> 01:23:53.968
Probably much like you.

01:23:55.554 --> 01:23:57.722
I don't think so, Mr. Petrovich.

01:23:59.433 --> 01:24:02.143
You're not like me at all.

01:24:12.863 --> 01:24:14.114
Excellent.

01:24:14.198 --> 01:24:16.074
Thanks.

01:24:16.158 --> 01:24:18.618
We got Petrovich. Snitch called it in.

01:24:18.702 --> 01:24:21.246
After all this time looking for him,
you know where he was?

01:24:21.330 --> 01:24:23.081
I'm sure you'll tell us.

01:24:23.165 --> 01:24:25.083
He was sitting on the boardwalk,
watching the sun come up.

01:24:25.167 --> 01:24:26.793
He's coming in now.

01:24:26.877 --> 01:24:28.711
I'll be right back.

01:24:30.923 --> 01:24:32.340
Yeah.

01:24:32.424 --> 01:24:35.552
What I didn't count on was that
a so-called professional

01:24:35.636 --> 01:24:37.679
would be manipulated by a chick.

01:24:37.763 --> 01:24:39.472
What kind of cops they make
down there in Miami?

01:24:39.557 --> 01:24:41.683
Good ones, Weber. Good ones.

01:24:41.767 --> 01:24:43.518
I don't get it.

01:24:43.602 --> 01:24:45.353
All these years in that world.

01:24:45.437 --> 01:24:47.188
How do you let an asset use you?

01:24:48.566 --> 01:24:51.067
Sometimes things, uh, change.

01:24:51.235 --> 01:24:52.318
"Things change"?

01:24:52.403 --> 01:24:55.613
Like a "which side am I on" change?

01:24:55.698 --> 01:24:58.116
Ripley, what is he, your best friend now?

01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:00.326
Well, actually, a better friend than you.

01:25:00.411 --> 01:25:02.453
Ah, I get it.

01:25:02.538 --> 01:25:03.746
I'm the asshole.

01:25:03.831 --> 01:25:05.456
You're gonna tell me what a good guy he is

01:25:05.541 --> 01:25:08.376
or how he got caught up
in a situation he couldn't control

01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:11.004
or how the sins of the father
shouldn't rest on the daughter?

01:25:11.088 --> 01:25:14.048
Give me something better
than "things change."

01:25:14.175 --> 01:25:17.468
All I can give you is the truth.

01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:20.847
Eh, fuck it.

01:25:20.931 --> 01:25:23.057
Go back to Miami, Martin.

01:25:25.477 --> 01:25:29.480
When your superiors get my report,
you'll be lucky if you have a job.

01:25:29.565 --> 01:25:30.857
We'll see.

01:25:30.941 --> 01:25:33.026
Hey, say anything you want about Ripley,

01:25:33.110 --> 01:25:36.154
but nothing changes the fact
that I finally got him.

01:25:36.238 --> 01:25:40.116
Now when he leaves prison,
he'll be leaving in a pine box.

01:25:41.577 --> 01:25:43.077
Let's go see Mr. Petrovich.

01:25:56.717 --> 01:25:58.343
No.

01:26:05.226 --> 01:26:07.060
That's not Nicky Petrovich.

01:26:07.144 --> 01:26:08.686
What?

01:26:08.771 --> 01:26:10.355
Not him.

01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:16.027
Look, man, Organized Crime confirmed it.

01:26:16.111 --> 01:26:18.988
- That's Nicky Petrovich.
- Well, I don't care.

01:26:19.073 --> 01:26:20.073
That's not him.

01:26:20.157 --> 01:26:22.325
I was there, remember?

01:26:22.409 --> 01:26:25.119
There's no case here.

01:26:25.246 --> 01:26:27.497
What are you talking about?
Of course there's a case.

01:26:27.581 --> 01:26:29.749
Do you really think I'm going
to put him on the stand?

01:26:29.833 --> 01:26:32.627
An undercover Miami cop
who may or may not be legit?

01:26:32.711 --> 01:26:33.795
- No offense.
- None taken.

01:26:33.879 --> 01:26:36.881
A cop who's the centerpiece
of a botched undercover operation

01:26:36.966 --> 01:26:39.133
that was officially ordered stopped?

01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:42.011
I'm not going to embarrass the Bureau,
much less your department,

01:26:42.096 --> 01:26:45.306
which accepted tons of money
and equipment from the Russian Mafia.

01:26:45.391 --> 01:26:46.724
What about Romanov's?

01:26:46.809 --> 01:26:49.310
What about the goddamn
stolen treasures of Russia?

01:26:49.395 --> 01:26:50.395
What about it, Weber?

01:26:50.479 --> 01:26:52.146
When Zykov found Ripley in the vault,

01:26:52.273 --> 01:26:54.607
he had everything cleared out
before you could get in.

01:26:54.692 --> 01:26:57.277
I have a proposition for you.

01:26:57.361 --> 01:27:00.697
There's no way Romanov's
will press charges against Ripley.

01:27:00.781 --> 01:27:02.365
Because they can never admit that the eggs

01:27:02.449 --> 01:27:05.285
or anything else ever existed.

01:27:05.369 --> 01:27:07.287
So we can't even prove
that Detective Martin and Ripley

01:27:07.371 --> 01:27:09.580
stole even a goddamn dime.

01:27:09.665 --> 01:27:11.791
But you must have mug shots.

01:27:11.875 --> 01:27:14.502
Russian Mafia,
known associates, something.

01:27:38.736 --> 01:27:41.279
That's him.

01:27:41.363 --> 01:27:43.072
That's Nicky Petrovich.

01:27:43.157 --> 01:27:46.576
- Detective Martin?
- Yeah?

01:27:46.660 --> 01:27:48.786
That's Victor Korolenko.

01:27:59.173 --> 01:28:01.215
Presumed dead.

01:28:02.426 --> 01:28:05.345
We just never found the body.

01:28:09.099 --> 01:28:13.227
We never will...Lieutenant.

01:28:58.899 --> 01:29:00.691
Weber.

01:29:00.776 --> 01:29:01.901
What?

01:29:01.985 --> 01:29:03.820
His lawyer got him in front of a judge

01:29:03.904 --> 01:29:05.321
on an expedited bail hearing.

01:29:05.406 --> 01:29:06.864
Then he just walked.

01:29:06.949 --> 01:29:08.491
Who was it?

01:29:08.575 --> 01:29:10.868
- Who was what?
- The lawyer.

01:29:10.953 --> 01:29:13.204
Who the fuck do you think?

01:29:13.288 --> 01:29:14.497
Alex.

01:29:14.581 --> 01:29:16.249
Korolenko.

01:29:38.605 --> 01:29:44.527
You can't promise me a thing,
so maybe we shouldn't even try.

01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:29.030
Papa.

01:30:29.114 --> 01:30:31.157
Shall we go?

01:30:42.669 --> 01:30:43.669
Yeah?

01:30:43.754 --> 01:30:46.714
Didn't want to leave
without saying good-bye.

01:30:46.798 --> 01:30:49.342
I owe you one, Gaby.

01:30:49.426 --> 01:30:50.760
The real Nicky Petrovich

01:30:50.844 --> 01:30:53.763
is the one Zykov is funneling
the contraband through.

01:30:53.847 --> 01:30:58.059
Thank you, but Zykov and Petrovich

01:30:58.143 --> 01:30:59.310
have gone underground.

01:30:59.394 --> 01:31:00.520
Check out a disco called--

01:31:00.604 --> 01:31:02.021
Riga Rose?

01:31:02.105 --> 01:31:04.774
Ah, I see you're familiar
with the territory.

01:31:04.858 --> 01:31:07.944
Well...I am a cop, remember?

01:31:08.028 --> 01:31:09.820
Never forgot it for a second.

01:31:09.905 --> 01:31:11.489
When did you know?

01:31:11.573 --> 01:31:15.409
I knew you were coming up from Miami
before you did, Gaby.

01:31:15.536 --> 01:31:16.911
See, Weber and I--

01:31:16.995 --> 01:31:19.664
Well, let's just say
we share the same sources,

01:31:19.748 --> 01:31:21.207
only I pay better.

01:31:21.291 --> 01:31:22.917
Sir, we're good to go.

01:31:23.001 --> 01:31:25.378
So why the help, Ripley?

01:31:25.462 --> 01:31:27.463
Maybe feeling guilty?

01:31:29.007 --> 01:31:31.884
"Guilt" is not even in my vocabulary.

01:31:31.969 --> 01:31:35.388
I was just hoping
you'd see things differently.

01:31:35.472 --> 01:31:38.558
Together, you and I could do andhing.

01:31:40.102 --> 01:31:41.477
Yeah.

01:31:41.562 --> 01:31:43.271
I believe we did.

01:31:43.355 --> 01:31:46.440
I'll get in touch later on,
if you're interested.

01:31:46.567 --> 01:31:49.235
Meanwhile, I've got to keep
an appointment with a man

01:31:49.319 --> 01:31:50.778
who's gonna pay very dearly
for something

01:31:50.862 --> 01:31:53.030
he's got to keep locked in his basement

01:31:53.115 --> 01:31:54.740
just to say it's his.

01:31:56.577 --> 01:31:58.369
- Good hunting, Gaby.
- Wait, wait, wait!

01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:01.539
Let me talk to her, just for a second.

01:32:01.623 --> 01:32:02.832
That's him?

01:32:02.916 --> 01:32:04.584
What makes you think
she's going anywhere?

01:32:04.668 --> 01:32:06.168
She didn't commit any crime.

01:32:06.253 --> 01:32:09.338
She just lied to someone
who was lying to her.

01:32:20.642 --> 01:32:22.602
You be good.

01:32:22.686 --> 01:32:25.813
I'll try, Uncle Keith.

01:32:25.897 --> 01:32:30.192
Although I suspect
my legal career just ended.

01:32:30.277 --> 01:32:32.528
Thank God.

01:33:02.809 --> 01:33:04.935
You come in here every night,

01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:10.149
and every night I tell you
I don't know shit from this Petrovich.

01:33:11.652 --> 01:33:13.944
This is a nightclub, my friend.

01:33:14.029 --> 01:33:16.614
You know what I think?

01:33:16.698 --> 01:33:19.033
I think you need to check out the action

01:33:19.117 --> 01:33:20.660
and get your ass laid.

01:33:20.744 --> 01:33:21.744
Yeah.

01:33:21.828 --> 01:33:23.996
- You know what I'm saying to you?
- Yeah.

01:33:24.081 --> 01:33:26.248
Find yourself a chick.

01:33:37.552 --> 01:33:41.847
Vodka.

01:33:41.932 --> 01:33:43.349
Zakuska?

01:33:43.433 --> 01:33:45.476
Russian hors d'oeuvres
to coat the stomach.

01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:46.769
Oh.

01:33:47.938 --> 01:33:49.438
Will my stomach need coating?

01:33:49.523 --> 01:33:51.732
I hope so.

01:33:51.817 --> 01:33:54.151
I thought you didn't drink.

01:33:54.236 --> 01:33:55.861
You thought a lot of things,

01:33:55.946 --> 01:33:59.907
but I believe I mentioned something
about making assumptions.

01:33:59.991 --> 01:34:02.118
Maybe that's a concept
we should get rid of.

01:34:02.202 --> 01:34:03.327
lmmediately.

01:34:03.412 --> 01:34:06.414
My name is Gabriel Martin.

01:34:06.498 --> 01:34:08.791
I am from Miami.

01:34:08.875 --> 01:34:13.796
I was actually looking for a lawyer,
but the office was closed.

01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:17.633
So...I came here.

01:34:21.596 --> 01:34:23.431
Okay.

01:34:23.515 --> 01:34:27.768
My name is Alexandra Korolenko,

01:34:27.853 --> 01:34:31.188
and I come from St. Petersburg

01:34:31.273 --> 01:34:33.232
by way of Little Odessa.

01:34:34.526 --> 01:34:36.777
And...

01:34:36.862 --> 01:34:38.946
I love to dance.

01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:40.740
So...

01:34:40.824 --> 01:34:43.200
I came here tonight.

01:34:48.957 --> 01:34:51.167
Do you want to dance with me?

01:34:53.754 --> 01:34:54.754
Yeah.

01:34:57.591 --> 01:34:59.842
I'm willing to make a fool of myself.

01:35:02.971 --> 01:35:04.472
Me, too.

01:35:06.892 --> 01:35:08.642
- Alex?
- Yeah?

01:35:08.769 --> 01:35:12.521
That night, when I called you
from Coney lsland,

01:35:12.606 --> 01:35:15.024
you never answered my question.

01:35:15.108 --> 01:35:16.692
Which one?

01:35:17.778 --> 01:35:20.321
I wanted to-- I want to know...

01:35:24.117 --> 01:35:25.659
Was it all lies?

01:35:34.419 --> 01:35:36.170
Not the part that matters.

01:35:36.254 --> 01:35:40.299
<i>♫  Starting right here,
let's make a promise</i>

01:35:40.383 --> 01:35:41.842
<i>♫   You and me</i>

01:35:41.927 --> 01:35:43.594
<i>♫   Let's just be honest</i>

01:35:43.678 --> 01:35:45.679
<i>♫   We're gonna run</i>

01:35:45.806 --> 01:35:47.181
<i>♫   Nothing can stop us</i>

01:35:47.265 --> 01:35:48.682
That was true.

01:35:50.811 --> 01:35:52.102
That was real. I felt that.

01:35:52.187 --> 01:35:54.897
That was real.
That was real. Finally.

01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:02.112
<i>♫   We'll run away
on roads that are empty</i>

01:36:02.197 --> 01:36:05.991
<i>♫   Lights from the airfield
shining upon you</i>

01:36:06.076 --> 01:36:07.576

<i>♫   They're not gonna get us</i>

01:36:35.397 --> 01:36:38.941
<i>♫   We'll run away,
keep everything simple</i>

01:36:39.025 --> 01:36:42.695
<i>♫   Night will come down,
our guardian angel</i>

01:36:42.779 --> 01:36:46.490
<i>♫   We rush ahead,
the crossroads are empty</i>

01:36:46.575 --> 01:36:47.867
<i>♫   Our spirits rise</i>

01:36:47.951 --> 01:36:49.994
<i>♫   They're not gonna get us</i>

01:36:50.078 --> 01:36:53.831
<i>♫   My love for you, always forever</i>

01:36:53.915 --> 01:36:55.457
<i>♫   Just you and me</i>

01:36:55.542 --> 01:36:57.543
<i>♫   All else is nothing</i>

01:36:57.627 --> 01:37:01.005
<i>♫   Not going back,
not going back there</i>

01:37:01.089 --> 01:37:02.840
<i>♫   They don't understand</i>

01:37:02.924 --> 01:37:05.009
<i>♫   They don't understand us</i>

01:37:05.093 --> 01:37:07.678
<i>♫   Don't understand us</i>

01:37:12.225 --> 01:37:15.769
<i>♫   Not gonna get us</i>

01:37:15.896 --> 01:37:17.855
