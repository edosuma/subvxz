overstepped the car on the way here.

09:00.070 --> 09:03.007
I'm afraid I left here. Forgive...

09:03.107 --> 09:06.105
But I was wondering if
happened was in that direction.

09:06.205 --> 09:08.673
I can stay here, and do
not know what to do.

09:08.773 --> 09:11.214
If you'll excuse me,
my husband was wrong.

Not have to.
I can not wear tonight...

09:27.561 --> 09:30.197
But I will get there early in the morning.

09:30.297 --> 09:33.237
Meanwhile, you can be in a place like this.

09:33.337 --> 09:36.571
There is no other way.
- Yes there is.

09:36.671 --> 09:38.474
I'm the Baroness Meinster.

09:38.574 --> 09:41.662
My castle is in the
hills, just above the village.

09:41.762 --> 09:44.512
Please grant me the pleasure
to host it tonight.

09:44.612 --> 09:48.817
I will be more than grateful.
- Then do not waste any more time.

09:48.917 --> 09:50.917
Come.

09:53.207 --> 09:56.677
You are very kind, Madame.
- I'm not at all well.

09:56.777 --> 09:58.892
I am a very lonely old who often longs...

09:58.992 --> 10:01.816
The company of someone with
class and education...

10:01.916 --> 10:04.126
Rare thing in these parts.

10:19.867 --> 10:23.619
Let me introduce myself, Madame.
My name is Marianne Danielle.

Can be ready in that time?

11:18.440 --> 11:20.440
Yes, Madame.

11:34.608 --> 11:38.962
The Baroness is very friendly, but
I think I'm pestering terribly.

11:39.062 --> 11:42.182
I had no idea I was waiting for a guest.

11:42.282 --> 11:44.282
Do not wait for anyone.

11:46.787 --> 11:50.952
Baroness
always has another post if someone comes.

11:51.125 --> 11:53.923
And I come, right?

11:55.796 --> 11:57.796
Yes.

12:18.986 --> 12:22.556
Ten minutes.
Please do not wait for Madame.

13:14.575 --> 13:16.575
'Il See more of day.

13:17.544 --> 13:19.544
Madame is waiting.

13:20.547 --> 13:24.711
Greta, you
said she was not expecting anyone...

13:24.818 --> 13:29.238
I mean a guest.
But I saw a man on the balcony below.

13:29.957 --> 13:32.105
Not look like a servant.

13:32.205 --> 13:35.796
I am the only servant who
remains in the castle Meinster.

13:35.896 --> 13:38.364
I was sure I saw a young man.

13:40.501 --> 13:44.071
Madame is waiting. Are you ready?
- Almost.

14:14.234 --> 14:16.234
Do not be served soup?

14:17.404 --> 14:19.784
I have very little appetite.

14:34.154 --> 14:38.926
Greta told me that you have seen believes
someone in the balcony in your room.

14:39.026 --> 14:43.106
I thought so. I thought I saw a
man, a young man.

14:43.191 --> 14:47.611
I can But I was wrong.
- Not mistaken. He saw my son.

14:48.068 --> 14:50.920
But I thought...
- Thought I wanted to think...

14:51.020 --> 14:55.275
It was an old woman who lived alone
here. Now you know I'm not alone.

14:55.375 --> 14:56.910
I have a son.

14:57.010 --> 15:00.036
Please, no...
- My son is sick.

15:01.481 --> 15:02.994
I'm so sorry.

15:03.094 --> 15:07.344
His illness has destroyed my
quiet in recent years.

15:07.888 --> 15:10.706
You will not believe, but we've
had happy moments here.

15:10.806 --> 15:12.806
Dances, dinners...

15:13.493 --> 15:15.811
Life.
- I'm sure.

15:15.911 --> 15:20.081
People used to come from all over Europe,
including Paris to be my guests...

15:20.181 --> 15:22.236
Until he ruined everything.

15:22.336 --> 15:24.964
He ruined everything? How?

15:25.739 --> 15:30.669
I hurt too much not to present
my only son to my friends...

15:31.211 --> 15:33.506
Have to keep him locked up.

15:38.185 --> 15:40.779
Are you mentally ill?

15:41.855 --> 15:43.855
I never see him.

15:44.625 --> 15:46.625
Greta caregiver.

15:47.060 --> 15:49.060
She is his old nurse.

15:54.868 --> 15:59.883
Do not you ever see it?
- It has made me suffer so terribly.

16:00.440 --> 16:03.624
Have their own rooms away from
the rest of the castle...

16:03.724 --> 16:07.209
At Can only be accessed through the door.

16:08.682 --> 16:10.567
But that's nothing.

16:10.667 --> 16:13.469
What is vital is that you
discovered its existence...

16:13.569 --> 16:15.100
And explained the situation.

16:15.200 --> 16:19.025
But, Madame, are you sure you are happy
there?

16:19.626 --> 16:21.626
Fools Are they happy?

16:22.796 --> 16:25.176
Sure you could do something.

16:25.632 --> 16:29.329
No doctors?
- Pray for death, him and me.

16:30.003 --> 16:32.062
At least, I hope so.

16:32.372 --> 16:34.521
The people here believe that you died.

16:34.621 --> 16:37.411
That I have, and I promote that belief.

16:37.511 --> 16:39.511
Does promotes?

16:39.646 --> 16:42.876
I see you judging me, my young friend.

16:42.963 --> 16:46.108
Sleep before delivering his sentence.

16:48.188 --> 16:51.473
I am very tired.
I can say goodnight?

16:51.573 --> 16:54.123
Of course, Madame. Good night.

16:54.209 --> 16:56.287
Thanks. And I can say...

16:57.064 --> 16:59.064
God bless?

17:02.969 --> 17:04.969
If only he could do.

18:12.272 --> 18:15.469
No. Do not.

18:52.312 --> 18:54.312
Who are you?

18:54.481 --> 18:56.481
Who are you?

18:56.783 --> 19:00.433
What do you come here?
- I called him from my window.

19:00.533 --> 19:02.954
I'm here to help if I can.

19:04.724 --> 19:06.724
To help me?

19:07.360 --> 19:09.360
Really?

19:10.530 --> 19:12.530
Come on, will you?

19:14.568 --> 19:17.662
Do not be afraid. I want her.

19:27.380 --> 19:29.380
You are very beautiful.

19:30.750 --> 19:33.895
Then you have come to help me, right?

19:34.221 --> 19:38.055
No one can do that,
Mademoiselle. No one can.

19:38.325 --> 19:41.745
I was terrified to leave
to shoot from the balcony.

19:41.845 --> 19:43.864
I assure you it was going to.

19:43.964 --> 19:45.964
I can not.

19:46.500 --> 19:48.500
Approach.

19:48.551 --> 19:50.551
Please stop.

19:51.271 --> 19:53.271
Look, I...

19:53.907 --> 19:56.202
I can not get close to you.

20:01.948 --> 20:04.097
But that is inhumane.

20:04.197 --> 20:06.800
My mother thinks I'm human, is not it?

20:06.900 --> 20:09.110
Guess he said I'm crazy...

20:09.190 --> 20:12.941
I have to be enclosed for the good of all.

20:13.041 --> 20:16.277
Why would not I?
And why should not I believe him?

20:16.377 --> 20:20.615
I do not know what to believe.
- Look, Mademoiselle, this castle...

20:20.715 --> 20:23.653
Mountains, dark hectares of forest...

20:23.753 --> 20:26.473
Even the valley below, I belong.

20:26.606 --> 20:30.838
They are my heritage. I am Baron Meinster.

20:31.645 --> 20:35.582
But my mother is a woman
vicious, evil and envious.

20:35.682 --> 20:37.662
Let people think I'm dead.

20:37.762 --> 20:42.335
Wants to think that the castle and lands
have been bequeathed.

20:42.435 --> 20:44.841
Never mind that they do.

20:44.941 --> 20:49.191
I'm more than half
dead, enclosed living well.

20:49.429 --> 20:53.422
I should not talk like that.
I promise to help.

20:53.733 --> 20:56.883
If you trust me, I'm sure I could.

20:56.983 --> 21:00.018
Just tell me what to do.
- Could you...?

21:00.118 --> 21:03.603
I wonder if I could find the key to this.

21:04.444 --> 21:06.396
Where the guard his mother?

21:06.496 --> 21:09.629
Greta says a key
drawer dresser in your room.

21:09.729 --> 21:12.953
This is the room next to hers.
- Find her.

21:13.053 --> 21:16.708
Will it? There are serious risks, you know?

21:17.023 --> 21:20.220
Do you think you dare?
- Yes, I dare.

23:56.116 --> 23:58.448
Lord Baron.
- Yes.

23:58.718 --> 24:01.902
I found a key.
- Well. TÃ­remela.

24:02.002 --> 24:04.002
A minute.

24:12.866 --> 24:15.582
Now you should dress
fast and meet me outside, okay?

24:15.682 --> 24:18.501
Yes - But hurry.

24:31.885 --> 24:33.885
Give me back the key.

24:34.220 --> 24:37.891
But, Madame, I...
- Has taken a key to my room.

24:37.991 --> 24:41.276
Return it to me. Do you hear me?

24:41.376 --> 24:44.010
I assure you, that I have no key.
- The must have.

24:44.110 --> 24:47.016
EntrÃ©guemela. EntrÃ©guemela.
- Leave me alone.

24:47.116 --> 24:48.680
Not brought it to my son.

24:48.780 --> 24:51.840
Silly, do not know what he has done.

25:03.650 --> 25:07.347
Help me. Help me.
- Easy. Do not worry.

25:07.787 --> 25:10.483
Now it can hurt.

25:10.657 --> 25:12.782
There is nothing to fear.

25:14.127 --> 25:16.762
Go to your room and wait there.

25:29.709 --> 25:31.709
Mother, come here.

25:32.445 --> 25:34.214
No.

25:34.314 --> 25:36.314
No, son.

25:37.283 --> 25:39.283
Mother.

25:43.590 --> 25:45.590
Come here.

26:06.379 --> 26:08.677
Now, mother, come with me.

26:16.222 --> 26:18.222

26:21.995 --> 26:23.995
Oh, my God.

26:26.366 --> 26:28.800
Gone. By God.

26:29.135 --> 26:32.036
May God help us. It's free.

26:32.405 --> 26:36.995
Is free. God help us.
It's gone. He's gone. It is free.

27:02.035 --> 27:04.936
Gone. Oh, my God. The rascal.

27:16.516 --> 27:19.542
Oh, my God. It is free.

27:19.953 --> 27:21.953
Is free. He's gone.

27:24.324 --> 27:26.324
What is the problem?

27:27.427 --> 27:30.487
I did. It is free. The rascal.

27:30.630 --> 27:32.846
Why was locked? He's not crazy.

27:32.946 --> 27:36.261
No, not crazy.
That's all I know, right?

27:36.349 --> 27:39.851
You brought the key? Was it you? You.

27:39.951 --> 27:41.789
Did he?
- Where is it?

27:41.889 --> 27:43.889
It was...

27:44.677 --> 27:46.677
At night.

27:50.516 --> 27:52.643
Walk fluttering bats.

27:53.820 --> 27:55.820
Listen.

27:55.989 --> 27:58.964
There is a wolf howling down there.

28:00.426 --> 28:03.316
The getting up at all, believe it.

28:03.863 --> 28:07.355
Do not know what he has done, I do.

28:07.600 --> 28:09.715
Are you crazy or what?

28:09.815 --> 28:13.033
Where is the Baroness?
- Not far.

28:14.440 --> 28:16.440
Want to see it?

28:20.913 --> 28:22.913
Do you like?

28:23.816 --> 28:25.816
Yeah?

28:35.294 --> 28:37.294
Look.

28:37.463 --> 28:39.928
Do not be afraid. She's dead.

28:40.133 --> 28:43.958
What have you done?
- He's dead and it's free.

29:21.040 --> 29:24.237
Do not blame me, love. I did not do.

29:24.544 --> 29:26.544
No.

29:27.113 --> 29:29.565
I've always been loyal.

29:29.665 --> 29:33.130
Twenty years since I saw the castle
come first...

29:33.230 --> 29:35.915
With Baron and his son.

29:37.457 --> 29:40.877
Also was an imp, thin and cute.

29:40.977 --> 29:43.428
But you spoiled. Oh, yes.

29:43.729 --> 29:47.413
Was always willed and ruthless,
and you encouraged him.

29:47.513 --> 29:50.998
Yes, and bad company with mixed you, too.

29:51.270 --> 29:53.722
You used to sit and drink with them, right?

29:53.822 --> 29:56.286
Yes, and laughed at his perverse games.

29:56.386 --> 30:00.971
Until finally one of them
took it and did what he is.

30:03.416 --> 30:07.620
You have done what you could for
him since then, God help...

30:07.720 --> 30:10.971
Keeping prisoner, bringing young girls...

30:11.071 --> 30:13.205
Keeping him alive with their blood.

30:13.305 --> 30:17.230
But the powers of darkness
are too strong. The beat.

30:17.330 --> 30:19.330
He is free.

30:21.634 --> 30:23.648
But back here.

30:23.748 --> 30:25.748
That's for sure.

30:28.307 --> 30:33.747
Yes, you have to come back here to
his old Greta. He will return.

30:38.718 --> 30:43.393
'Il Have to come back before
the crowing of the rooster.

31:10.149 --> 31:14.314
Carl, brings travel blanket, will you?
- Yes, sir.

31:21.594 --> 31:23.858
Okay. Put it around her.

31:26.999 --> 31:28.512
Not dead, right?
- No.

31:28.612 --> 31:32.692
I think it's a severe case of shock
. Exhaustion.

31:44.016 --> 31:46.868
Now do not worry. What we Badstein
distance?

31:46.968 --> 31:48.968
A three or four miles.

31:49.655 --> 31:51.872
It's been a terrible shock, hasn't it?

31:51.972 --> 31:57.412
But there is nothing to fear now.
I am a doctor, Dr. Van Helsing.

32:30.496 --> 32:32.623
Now just sit here.

32:41.974 --> 32:43.974
Are you the owner?

32:46.279 --> 32:47.562
Coffee and brandy, please.

32:47.662 --> 32:50.999
I'm sorry, sir.
- Please, this girl was not right.

32:51.099 --> 32:53.300
Miss, I'm glad to see you safe.

32:53.400 --> 32:56.102
I fear is closed to clients this morning, sir.

32:56.202 --> 32:58.669
The priest Stepmade
booked me a room. I'm Van Helsing.

32:58.769 --> 33:01.739
Yes, of course. I'm sorry, sir.
- I'll bring coffee.

33:01.839 --> 33:03.374
There was a death in the village.

33:03.474 --> 33:06.246
Hans's daughter, a girl so beautiful.

33:06.346 --> 33:08.548
Was found dead in the woods.

33:08.648 --> 33:12.453
The are watching there now.
- How did he die?

33:12.553 --> 33:15.052
No one really knows. But certainly dead.

33:15.152 --> 33:16.958
Stepmade The father is.

33:17.058 --> 33:19.928
It's going to be buried in the churchyard
without.

33:20.028 --> 33:23.831
I can see it?
- You could see it, of course.

33:23.931 --> 33:26.802
Probably would like,
considering he's a doctor.

33:26.902 --> 33:29.282
But you can not do anything.

33:29.343 --> 33:31.343
Do not be long.

33:52.745 --> 33:54.028
Wild garlic?

33:54.128 --> 33:57.730
Yes supposedly is a protection
against evil, vampires...

33:57.830 --> 34:02.204
And others. These superstitions local
must appear ridiculous.

34:02.304 --> 34:05.173
After all, who knows how he died?

34:05.273 --> 34:10.118
Generally, there is good reason
for these ancient customs.

34:19.839 --> 34:21.839
There is his father.

34:28.947 --> 34:32.042
He's a doctor.
- I'm sorry.

34:34.820 --> 34:36.820
It was a good girl.

34:37.389 --> 34:39.855
I can not believe she's dead.

34:40.559 --> 34:42.728
If only the priest was here.

34:42.828 --> 34:46.143
The whole evening was like a nightmare.

34:46.766 --> 34:51.036
I can not believe it happened.
- Then do not talk about it.

34:51.137 --> 34:53.853
The Baroness seemed friendly at first...

34:53.953 --> 34:56.672
But his son...
- Does your child?

34:56.724 --> 34:59.007
Sure is not alive yet.

35:00.079 --> 35:02.079
It's a long story.

35:05.584 --> 35:08.984
Do you feel well enough to travel?
- Yes.

35:10.656 --> 35:13.750
Goodbye and thank you.
- Back later.

35:24.203 --> 35:27.006
After that, I remember having seen you.

35:27.106 --> 35:29.524
I fear have been a problem for you.

35:29.624 --> 35:31.377
At all.

35:31.477 --> 35:34.194
What was the name of the
castle where he stayed?

35:34.294 --> 35:36.294
Meinster Castle.

35:36.849 --> 35:39.735
Do you know him?
- I know it.

35:39.835 --> 35:42.901
And is poised to School
for Girls in Badstein.

35:43.001 --> 35:45.991
I will teach there, French and behavior.

35:46.091 --> 35:48.707
I'm sure it will do well in both.
- Merci.

35:48.807 --> 35:52.580
What happened to your luggage?
- I left it in the castle.

35:52.680 --> 35:55.584
I'll have to ask me to send it.
- Since the castle?

35:55.684 --> 35:57.648
I do not think that's good idea.
- But...

35:57.748 --> 36:00.102
Please let me explain.

36:00.339 --> 36:03.354
I have been asked to make a
study of a rare disease.

36:03.454 --> 36:06.779
Illness partly physical, partly spiritual.

36:06.879 --> 36:10.315
And I can know what is?

36:10.683 --> 36:13.618
You heard cult of the living dead?

36:14.687 --> 36:16.301
The living dead?
- Yes.

36:16.401 --> 36:18.003
Did you hear about that?
- No.

36:18.103 --> 36:20.490
Are you sure?
- Very safe.

36:20.860 --> 36:24.476
Is most prevalent in Transylvania
and the Lower Danube.

36:24.576 --> 36:25.947
What can be spread?

36:26.047 --> 36:28.748
Unless eradicated.
Why I'm here.

36:28.848 --> 36:30.848
And you could help me.

36:30.970 --> 36:34.553
I want you to tell me everything that
happened in the castle Meinster.

36:34.653 --> 36:36.288
But...
- Every detail...

36:36.388 --> 36:39.795
Not leave anything out, no
matter how trivial like it.

36:39.895 --> 36:41.527
You will?
- Yes.

36:41.627 --> 36:43.864
And when I have said,
I want to forget it.

36:43.964 --> 36:46.733
Forget completely and never
mention it to anyone.

36:46.833 --> 36:49.867
Yes that's what you want.
- Is that a promise?

36:49.967 --> 36:51.967
Yes.
- Well.

37:12.811 --> 37:16.163
This is Mademoiselle Danielle.
It has come to start work.

37:16.263 --> 37:18.263
Can get in?

37:22.821 --> 37:25.691
I'll tell the manager that you are here.

37:25.791 --> 37:27.791
I will hear it, Elsa.

37:29.695 --> 37:32.614
You must be Marianne Danielle,
is not it? I'm Frau Lang.

37:32.714 --> 37:35.083
Welcome to the Academy.
- Thanks.

37:35.183 --> 37:36.517
This is Dr. Van Helsing.

37:36.617 --> 37:37.817
Nice.
- Encantada.

37:37.917 --> 37:40.653
He has been kind enough to
accompany me from the village.

37:40.753 --> 37:43.557
Your car broke down.
- So it was an accident?

37:43.657 --> 37:46.758
You are okay, right, dear?
No bones broke something?

37:46.858 --> 37:49.427
Thanks. I'm fine.
- But lost all his luggage.

37:49.527 --> 37:51.231
What bad luck.

37:51.331 --> 37:54.365
We can provide everything
you want until you recover.

37:54.465 --> 37:56.467
Come with me to meet Herr Lang.

37:56.567 --> 37:59.705
Should have known that he came, and
does not like to be kept waiting.

37:59.805 --> 38:01.974
Between you and me, is more of a stickler.

38:02.074 --> 38:05.076
I must get back to my...
- No. Please come, Dr. Van Helsing.

38:05.176 --> 38:07.014
You can help explain everything.

38:07.114 --> 38:11.403
The girl is a little late,
and Herr Lang is so picky.

38:11.503 --> 38:13.016
Is a wonderful man...

38:13.116 --> 38:17.405
Wonderful but just a little scary.

38:18.611 --> 38:22.096
Now, girls, do not stand there and watch.

38:23.048 --> 38:29.168
Christina, you're gonna get a fly
in the mouth if you do not close, dear.

38:32.157 --> 38:34.157
Let me talk to me.

38:40.432 --> 38:41.613
Otto, my love...

38:41.713 --> 38:43.815
Mademoiselle has come.
- How I knew...

38:43.915 --> 38:45.286
Late.
- Sorry.

38:45.386 --> 38:47.789
Mlle., After the maid comes punctuality.

38:47.889 --> 38:50.258
But, Otto, poor...
- Excuses, excuses always.

38:50.358 --> 38:53.059
I assure you, sir, that this was inevitable.

38:53.159 --> 38:55.693
Who are you?
- A friend of Mademoiselle.

38:55.793 --> 38:58.829
I've made it a rule, sir,
a rule of the Academy.

38:58.929 --> 39:01.999
The staff is not allowed
companions. No companion.

39:02.099 --> 39:04.099
I'm a doctor.

39:08.460 --> 39:10.460
Lydon University?

39:11.296 --> 39:13.296
Almost a colleague.

39:13.399 --> 39:16.799
My dear Dr. Van Helsing,
only had to say.

39:16.884 --> 39:19.287
Heavens. How could I recognize ask...

39:19.387 --> 39:21.756
A doctor of philosophy,
doctor of theology...

39:21.856 --> 39:24.658
Professor of metaphysics
by the style of his pants?

39:24.758 --> 39:27.927
I can trust that I will visit Mademoiselle?

39:28.027 --> 39:30.966
My dear doctor, rule
already revoked his favor.

39:31.066 --> 39:33.367
Thanks. Now if you'll excuse me.

39:33.467 --> 39:37.122
Dear sir, I am your humble servant
, always.

39:38.424 --> 39:41.654
Come with me, dear. He show your room.

39:44.329 --> 39:47.474
Now come on, girls. No more nonsense.

39:47.543 --> 39:49.543
You heard what I said.

39:49.902 --> 39:53.187
Gina,
I want to come in a moment, dear.

39:53.287 --> 39:55.690
How I can thank you for all your kindness?

39:55.790 --> 39:57.490
Delivering on its promise.
- I'll try.

39:57.590 --> 40:00.636
And do not let that scare ogre.

40:00.946 --> 40:04.116
Please come back
when passing through here, doctor.

40:04.216 --> 40:05.951
Frau Lang.

40:06.051 --> 40:07.800
Adieu, Mademoiselle.
- Au revoir.

40:07.900 --> 40:10.116
Please know the way.

40:10.956 --> 40:14.472
That lovely man.
- Yes, a gentle man.

40:14.572 --> 40:16.572
Yes Gina.

40:17.463 --> 40:19.578
She is a trainee teacher like you.

40:19.678 --> 40:22.449
Gina, Mademoiselle
just arrived and do not know anyone.

40:22.549 --> 40:24.115
I want to show you your room.

40:24.215 --> 40:26.935
Yes, Frau Lang.
- Room number 14.

40:27.339 --> 40:30.624
I always feel strange when
get to a new place, do you?

40:30.724 --> 40:33.019
'Il Get used. Come with me.

40:43.956 --> 40:47.186
Why, Father? Why had to happen to her?

40:47.263 --> 40:49.942
Was like a mother to her little sisters.

40:50.042 --> 40:53.612
Why God, in his wisdom
allows these things?

40:53.866 --> 40:55.866
Where is it, son?

40:56.802 --> 41:00.457
Where is Hans? You know
I should go see it.

41:00.706 --> 41:03.511
Came too late, father. Is buried.

41:03.742 --> 41:04.742
Where?

41:04.842 --> 41:07.027
In the courtyard of the church, where else?

41:07.127 --> 41:08.693
What holy ground?

41:08.793 --> 41:10.929
Is not that the right
of every man and woman?

41:11.029 --> 41:12.851
God forgive you.

41:12.951 --> 41:17.400
He's dead, right? Why can not lie
in peace like everyone else?

41:17.500 --> 41:20.192
Because she is not like the others.

41:20.292 --> 41:22.210
You know how he died, my son.

41:22.310 --> 41:25.646
I know what you're suffering,
but she can not lie there.

41:25.746 --> 41:27.746
Please father.

41:29.334 --> 41:31.382
Please let him stay there.

41:31.482 --> 41:34.687
Although I can not give you the
blessing of our holy Church Mother...

41:34.787 --> 41:36.854
Please let him stay there.

41:36.954 --> 41:38.954
My son...

41:39.645 --> 41:44.014
Should forget the idea that
was once your daughter.

41:45.017 --> 41:47.482
She is not like the living...

41:47.542 --> 41:50.347
Even, God help us, like the dead.

41:51.089 --> 41:53.649
No.

42:03.302 --> 42:05.302
Please drink this.

42:14.313 --> 42:16.313
Poor man.

42:16.397 --> 42:21.072
And I can not do anything, anything.
- Maybe I can help.

42:21.687 --> 42:23.470
Who are you.?
- You sent for me.

42:23.570 --> 42:27.071
Dr. Van Helsing.
- Thank God you're here.

42:27.171 --> 42:29.171
Thank God.

42:31.063 --> 42:32.076
Here.

42:32.176 --> 42:35.491
Will you unpack yourself, sir?
- Thanks.

42:40.572 --> 42:44.222
What is this... I call it vampirism?

42:44.322 --> 42:46.992
Is the survival of the old pagan religion...

42:47.092 --> 42:49.363
In their struggle against Christianity.

42:49.463 --> 42:52.598
So, he came first, the vampire?

42:52.698 --> 42:54.698
The Living Dead.

42:54.759 --> 42:57.518
And that is it spread?
- Yes.

42:57.623 --> 43:01.307
The Vampire, by his kiss,
to drink the blood of his victim...

43:01.407 --> 43:04.841
Makes it another vampire.
So, the cult grows...

43:04.941 --> 43:07.247
With infinite slowness, but grows.

43:07.347 --> 43:10.769
The vampire resting in the day, usually
in his grave...

43:10.869 --> 43:13.518
Appearing as living form only at night.

43:13.618 --> 43:16.721
And that means
need assistance, protection...

43:16.821 --> 43:19.525
A human during daytime hours.

43:19.625 --> 43:21.625
Such as?

43:21.719 --> 43:24.295
A mother can hide
to a daughter or son infected.

43:24.395 --> 43:25.429
He's a servant...

43:25.529 --> 43:27.632
Either hypnotized or so
devoted to his master...

43:27.732 --> 43:29.733
Not realizes the evil he is doing.

43:29.833 --> 43:31.880
A lost soul?
- Possibly.

43:32.658 --> 43:34.109
If not for this protection...

43:34.209 --> 43:37.612
Vampires could be reached during
the day and be destroyed.

43:37.712 --> 43:39.922
How can they be destroyed?

43:40.065 --> 43:43.147
Burying a stick of wood
in the heart or burning.

43:43.247 --> 43:46.621
The tormented soul is released
to return to the peace of death.

43:46.721 --> 43:49.624
These colonies, such as those
has here, must be eradicated.

43:49.724 --> 43:52.560
Only then this bondage
infernal world will be removed.

43:52.660 --> 43:56.160
Are there ways to distinguish these undead
of living?

43:56.260 --> 43:58.700
The sacred and Christian images repel.

43:58.800 --> 44:01.737
They are thin.
Have an air hunger in appearance.

44:01.837 --> 44:04.503
Your images are not reflected.
- Not even in the water?

44:04.603 --> 44:07.615
Not in a mirror?
- No.

44:09.995 --> 44:13.905
And some have the power
to transform into bats.

44:15.133 --> 44:18.958
Is this the grave of the girl?
- Yes, must be.

44:19.048 --> 44:24.042
There is still time. The sun has not yet set.
There will be active until then.

44:24.142 --> 44:26.142
Is not that sacrilege?

44:26.645 --> 44:29.564
No, father. Like I said,
is an act of healing.

44:29.664 --> 44:33.630
She will be back in the hands of God
and may lie in consecrated ground.

44:33.730 --> 44:35.730
Pray that is so.

44:35.815 --> 44:38.537
If you do not stop now,
Living Dead rise as...

44:38.637 --> 44:40.772
And begin a new cycle of evil.

44:40.872 --> 44:44.408
Remember, they are my
people. I am his priest.

44:44.508 --> 44:46.508
Then pray for me.

44:47.499 --> 44:49.499
I will, my son.

44:55.340 --> 44:57.340
And please...

44:57.509 --> 44:59.636
Can take this with you?

45:00.245 --> 45:04.181
Contains holy water. Can serve.

45:04.616 --> 45:06.616
Thank you, Father.

45:32.310 --> 45:34.310
Wake. Wake.

45:35.514 --> 45:38.129
Wake up, my dear, wake up.

45:38.229 --> 45:40.230
It's time to wake up.

45:40.330 --> 45:43.719
The master is waiting...

45:44.723 --> 45:46.073
Waiting to see you.

45:46.173 --> 45:48.173
Come on, wake up.

45:48.827 --> 45:50.827
Wake.

45:50.929 --> 45:53.124
Wake up, my dear.

45:56.068 --> 45:58.068
Already almost ready?

45:59.171 --> 46:03.039
No, I can not help you. You must be strong.

46:04.543 --> 46:05.744
What?

46:05.844 --> 46:09.143
Yes, I know it's dark, but you push.

46:09.514 --> 46:11.982
Yes, push.

46:12.417 --> 46:14.498
Thus push.

46:14.598 --> 46:17.817
Now, just a little more effort.

46:18.156 --> 46:20.156
Soon you'll be here.

46:20.241 --> 46:23.854
Come on now. Come on, sweetheart.

46:24.996 --> 46:27.510
Right. Come, my love.

46:27.610 --> 46:30.090
Thus the master is waiting.

46:33.805 --> 46:35.521
There.

46:35.621 --> 46:39.941
There comes. Here is my beauty. A sly.

46:45.417 --> 46:47.417
There's my cunning.

47:14.913 --> 47:16.715
Stop.

47:16.815 --> 47:18.896
In the name of the Almighty.
- Stay away.

47:18.996 --> 47:21.369
Stay away from here. Go small, fast.

47:21.469 --> 47:27.674
If you touch it, I'll rip your eyes.
- Hurry, son, before the girl escape.

51:18.890 --> 51:21.174
Who is not afraid?

51:21.274 --> 51:23.610
Only God has no fear.

51:23.710 --> 51:26.113
What do you here?
- To find her son.

51:26.213 --> 51:29.868
Then you know who I am.
- I know who he was.

52:39.938 --> 52:42.634
Escaped?
- Yes...

52:43.475 --> 52:46.638
...never catch him. He's too smart.

52:49.280 --> 52:53.551
Has drunk the blood of his own mother.
- It was all my fault.

52:53.651 --> 52:56.626
I loved his savagery. I encouraged.

52:56.715 --> 52:59.236
And when this thing
gripped him monstrous...

52:59.336 --> 53:01.276
Not sent for a priest or doctor.

53:01.376 --> 53:03.759
I hid and helped him live.

53:07.298 --> 53:10.953
And now there is no release of this life...

53:11.044 --> 53:13.060
It's not life or death.

53:13.938 --> 53:17.088
And I know I have to do
whatever horrendous...

53:17.188 --> 53:19.188
...ask me.

53:20.712 --> 53:22.712
There is a release.

53:30.588 --> 53:32.588
Forward.

53:34.225 --> 53:37.144
Sorry, Frau Lang. I did not know it was you.

53:37.244 --> 53:38.707
It's perfectly fine, dear.

53:38.807 --> 53:42.244
I thought best to break the news myself.
You know how girls gossiping.

53:42.344 --> 53:45.234
Honey, he's here.
- Who?

53:45.670 --> 53:50.288
Why not tell us what we wait?
Fortunately, Herr Lang went to the village.

53:50.388 --> 53:52.090
Not know what he would say if he knew.

53:52.190 --> 53:54.061
But who is?
- Come with me, darling...

53:54.161 --> 53:56.541
Should not keep you waiting.

54:00.752 --> 54:03.969
Lord, Baron.
- See? Do not I kept it to myself?

54:04.069 --> 54:05.703
I wanted so much to see her again...

54:05.803 --> 54:09.142
So I took the opportunity
to bring the luggage left.

54:09.242 --> 54:13.095
I thought I might need.
- What kind of you.

54:13.464 --> 54:16.850
His mother, Baroness, right?

54:16.950 --> 54:19.618
Sorry to tell you...

54:19.718 --> 54:21.718
She's dead.

54:21.839 --> 54:25.002
God. Sorry.

54:27.045 --> 54:30.397
So now alone there in that big house?

54:30.497 --> 54:33.245
Exactly.
- My God.

54:35.086 --> 54:39.237
Now, the leave totally alone...

54:39.337 --> 54:41.337
For 10 minutes.

54:48.833 --> 54:50.833
Marianne.

54:54.539 --> 54:56.539
What are you doing?

54:57.675 --> 54:59.973
Watching. Believe me.

55:00.345 --> 55:02.359
Watching what?

55:02.459 --> 55:05.799
A pair of lovebirds, bless their hearts.
- Who?

55:05.899 --> 55:08.465
Mademoiselle Danielle and a young, dear.

55:08.565 --> 55:10.565
What?

55:11.289 --> 55:14.174
Stop. What do you think you're doing?

55:14.274 --> 55:16.508
Rogue shameless.
- Herr Lang.

55:16.608 --> 55:20.447
Knows it's a rule, my rule.
No staff will accept visitors.

55:20.547 --> 55:22.545
What the hell you think you are doing here?

55:22.645 --> 55:26.020
A lovely lady left me get, in fact, is his wife.

55:26.120 --> 55:27.988
Do not be impertinent to me, sir...

55:28.088 --> 55:31.222
I will have the privilege of
throwing head out that window.

55:31.322 --> 55:34.892
For a more
interesting to know me, Herr Lang...

55:34.992 --> 55:36.993
But is not necessary
under the circumstances.

55:37.093 --> 55:40.265
Long wanted to know,
old and valued lieutenant.

55:40.365 --> 55:43.354
I'm not his lieutenant, young asshole.

55:43.454 --> 55:47.808
I'm Lieutenant Meinster State.
- Exactly, and I'm the Baron Meinster.

55:47.908 --> 55:49.973
I apologize for not having called sooner...

55:50.073 --> 55:52.609
But I was recovering from...

55:52.709 --> 55:54.114
A long illness.

55:54.214 --> 55:57.680
There would be here today if it was not
because he had urgent business...

55:57.780 --> 56:02.874
Mademoiselle arguing with Danielle,
who just accepted be my wife.

56:02.974 --> 56:04.974
Wonderful.

56:06.144 --> 56:08.827
Grateful if she could stay here a few weeks
...

56:08.927 --> 56:10.865
While I make arrangements
for the wedding.

56:10.965 --> 56:13.901
Of course, we would be more than honored.

56:14.001 --> 56:15.402
Yes, certainly.

56:15.502 --> 56:19.136
I can take the opportunity to
congratulate you and Frau Lang...

56:19.236 --> 56:20.907
By having the house more
charming and land...

56:21.007 --> 56:22.007
...

56:22.107 --> 56:25.529
At such a low price.

56:31.135 --> 56:35.719
I'm so proud of you,
Marianne. How does it feel to be Baroness?

56:35.819 --> 56:38.855
Not so fast. As we are committed.

56:38.955 --> 56:42.208
Is not it handsome?
- I think so.

56:45.349 --> 56:47.065
Then I should marry you.

56:47.165 --> 56:50.369
Is exactly as I imagined Prince Charming...

56:50.469 --> 56:52.469
Noble...

56:52.563 --> 56:54.858
And with eyes so wonderful.

56:54.913 --> 56:58.488
Them with such tenderness and humor.

56:59.997 --> 57:02.950
I must be careful, or I I myself love it.

57:03.050 --> 57:05.050
Not allow it.

57:05.143 --> 57:07.143
Toast.

57:08.639 --> 57:12.222
What unpleasant odor.
- I'm sorry.

57:12.322 --> 57:15.291
Not matter. I'll be down to get more bread.

57:15.391 --> 57:17.391
A FrÃ¤ulein not mind.

57:35.600 --> 57:37.600
I would have been me.

01:01:03.941 --> 01:01:06.671
Thank God it's okay.
- Father.

01:01:09.914 --> 01:01:11.995
What happened to this woman?

01:01:12.095 --> 01:01:15.644
I'm afraid I missed soon after you left.

01:01:15.987 --> 01:01:19.468
I tried to follow her, but lost her trail
in the dark.

01:01:19.568 --> 01:01:22.713
How did it go?
- I went to the castle.

01:01:23.294 --> 01:01:25.774
Remember when I wrote,
asking me to come?

01:01:25.874 --> 01:01:28.647
You told me about his suspicions
Baron and his mother.

01:01:28.747 --> 01:01:30.915
Yes, I remember.
- Were well founded.

01:01:31.015 --> 01:01:33.083
The Baroness was a victim of his own son.

01:01:33.183 --> 01:01:36.354
Oh, no.
- Now dead and at peace.

01:01:36.454 --> 01:01:38.242
May God rest his soul.

01:01:38.342 --> 01:01:41.232
But his son ran off with the girl.

01:01:42.446 --> 01:01:45.866
My son, we have much to thank...

01:01:45.966 --> 01:01:49.287
But I fear that their work is not yet finished.

01:01:49.387 --> 01:01:52.323
Must be tired. You should eat something.

01:01:52.423 --> 01:01:54.423
I'll walk soon.

01:01:57.661 --> 01:01:59.871
Is well and truly boiling?

01:01:59.924 --> 01:02:03.345
Straight from the teapot, doctor.
- Well. That's fine.

01:02:03.445 --> 01:02:06.590
Sure it might have been bronchitis...

01:02:06.653 --> 01:02:10.389
Pectoral or pneumonia. You never know.

01:02:10.489 --> 01:02:13.307
Benzoin resin extract.

01:02:16.614 --> 01:02:19.595
Yes, tincture of myrrh.
Only want a drop of that.

01:02:19.695 --> 01:02:21.695
Just a drop.

01:02:23.387 --> 01:02:27.847
Yes, liquor peppers,
a lot of that. Improvisation.

01:02:29.226 --> 01:02:32.423
Now, my good woman, towel.

01:02:32.763 --> 01:02:35.425
Right, right over my head.

01:02:36.167 --> 01:02:39.919
Pay no attention to anything I say.

01:02:40.019 --> 01:02:42.199
Hands.

01:02:46.343 --> 01:02:50.196
My dear, kind Frau,
I can not breathe. It's killing... Mercy.

01:02:50.296 --> 01:02:52.977
I can not breathe.

01:02:53.984 --> 01:02:56.077
Okay, there you go.

01:02:57.721 --> 01:02:58.768
What the hell does?

01:02:58.868 --> 01:03:01.809
I said no
would pay attention to anything I say.

01:03:01.909 --> 01:03:05.177
Let's try again, shall we?
- You can take care of myself, thank you.

01:03:05.277 --> 01:03:07.355
I have to go on living.

01:03:11.068 --> 01:03:14.383
With what we have to deal with doctors.

01:03:15.139 --> 01:03:17.321
Clerics First with you, father...

01:03:17.421 --> 01:03:20.726
With their superstitions monolithic.

01:03:20.826 --> 01:03:25.182
Then with peasants like her with
his indifference troglodyte.

01:03:25.282 --> 01:03:28.331
Of course, she may have died heart failure.

01:03:28.431 --> 01:03:30.202
I mean that the heart can...

01:03:30.302 --> 01:03:33.707
Have slowed and stopped.

01:03:33.807 --> 01:03:37.037
This is clearly a case for nux vomica.

01:03:39.730 --> 01:03:43.178
Or maybe galloped to a standstill.

01:03:43.278 --> 01:03:46.259
In that case, digital.

01:03:51.809 --> 01:03:54.694
And of course, always, and all the time...

01:03:54.794 --> 01:03:58.771
Valerian to calm my nerves.

01:04:13.397 --> 01:04:16.992
I mean, I have not drank all your alcohol.

01:04:17.935 --> 01:04:21.321
But if the patient is dead,
what good are all these concoctions?

01:04:21.421 --> 01:04:23.987
Prevention is better than cure,
father. Doing this...

01:04:24.087 --> 01:04:27.860
I have survived a lot deaths of others.

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:30.296
I'm trying to survive many more.

01:04:30.396 --> 01:04:33.497
But who died?
- One of the girls from the Academy.

01:04:33.597 --> 01:04:36.002
I think he died suddenly in the night.

01:04:36.102 --> 01:04:38.837
Dr. Tobler, this is Dr. Van Helsing.

01:04:38.937 --> 01:04:41.673
Are you sure it was a
student, and not a staff?

01:04:41.773 --> 01:04:43.609
Not say.

01:04:43.709 --> 01:04:45.775
Doctor, if you will see...

01:04:45.875 --> 01:04:48.343
Would be better to go with Dr. Van Helsing.

01:04:48.443 --> 01:04:50.884
Is one of the most eminent
physicians in Europe.

01:04:50.984 --> 01:04:53.835
Would it come free?
- Sure.

01:04:54.338 --> 01:04:56.073
Superb.

01:04:56.173 --> 01:05:00.423
This may include their fees Specialist
my own rate.

01:05:00.711 --> 01:05:04.828
Anyway,
it's worth trying. Is that okay?

01:05:04.928 --> 01:05:08.510
Why not?
- Thanks. Are we going then?

01:05:10.387 --> 01:05:12.387
Thanks.

01:05:17.561 --> 01:05:20.278
You say that the door was locked?
- Yes, inside...

01:05:20.378 --> 01:05:22.316
But the window was open.

01:05:22.416 --> 01:05:23.912
Open?
- Yes...

01:05:24.012 --> 01:05:26.562
...found her lying on the bed.

01:05:26.837 --> 01:05:28.837
What did he die?

01:05:29.506 --> 01:05:32.243
I'm not sure.
- But I have to know.

01:05:32.343 --> 01:05:34.823
One thing, if we can not say what it is...

01:05:34.923 --> 01:05:38.163
Could ruin us.
- I'll have to examine it further.

01:05:38.263 --> 01:05:42.938
Maybe it's better that you Frau Lang
and leave us alone.

01:05:45.522 --> 01:05:47.820
What's our verdict?

01:05:48.225 --> 01:05:51.540
Was there ever seen anything like this?

01:06:01.171 --> 01:06:04.720
This is a bite, is not it?
- I had seen before?

01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:08.835
Rarely.
Once or twice in the forest villages.

01:06:09.213 --> 01:06:13.343
You know, it probably a pet, a dog or cat.

01:06:13.751 --> 01:06:16.120
The villagers cherish, you know.

01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:18.734
Is a very unhealthy practice.
We can not stop them.

01:06:18.834 --> 01:06:21.674
Is the mark of the vampire,
sometimes called the seal Dracula.

01:06:21.774 --> 01:06:25.514
See how to cut through the vein?
- A vampire?

01:06:25.996 --> 01:06:27.313
No, I'm afraid not.

01:06:27.413 --> 01:06:29.783
Well, farmers are always talking...

01:06:29.883 --> 01:06:34.218
All about werewolves and vampires
. I'm a scientist.

01:06:34.805 --> 01:06:40.585
I always laugh these ridiculous legends.
- I would not if I were you.

01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:46.596
I do not want people to know this.
I let me handle this?

01:06:46.696 --> 01:06:50.313
No doubt, I'll leave everything to you.

01:06:50.621 --> 01:06:52.885
Except 'fees, of course.

01:07:01.231 --> 01:07:04.747
Died due to a fever.
- Yes, a fever.

01:07:04.847 --> 01:07:08.384
Is very contagious. I closed the
door of his room. Here's the key.

01:07:08.484 --> 01:07:09.687
What else should we do?

01:07:09.787 --> 01:07:12.855
The morticians
came earlier today. Back tomorrow.

01:07:12.955 --> 01:07:16.729
Look, these are my instructions.
Are there other outbuildings here?

01:07:16.829 --> 01:07:18.631
The Stables, of course.
- Well.

01:07:18.731 --> 01:07:21.134
Let am laid there in his coffin to the burial.

01:07:21.234 --> 01:07:23.535
No, Dr. Van Helsing, poor girl.

01:07:23.635 --> 01:07:25.071
Two people responsible...

01:07:25.171 --> 01:07:27.203
Should monitor the coffin until dusk.

01:07:27.303 --> 01:07:28.337
Back then.

01:07:28.437 --> 01:07:32.312
Meanwhile, must close the house,
keep doors and windows closed...

01:07:32.412 --> 01:07:34.646
And not be left alone to any of his students.

01:07:34.746 --> 01:07:36.746
Got it?
- Of course.

01:07:36.829 --> 01:07:39.314
We can arrange this immediately.

01:07:39.414 --> 01:07:41.653
Excuse me, doctor.
Marianne accompany you to the door.

01:07:41.753 --> 01:07:43.753
Come, Helga.

01:07:47.745 --> 01:07:49.595
I'm so sorry, dear.

01:07:49.695 --> 01:07:53.350
All this disorder, as soon after his arrival.

01:07:53.450 --> 01:07:57.020
But do not let it ruin personal happiness.

01:07:57.688 --> 01:07:59.904
Did you tell Dr. Van Helsing?
- Helga.

01:08:00.004 --> 01:08:02.004
I, dear.

01:08:04.628 --> 01:08:07.064
I can serve me a glass of wine?

01:08:07.164 --> 01:08:11.535
Had to tell me something?
- You have been so kind to me.

01:08:11.635 --> 01:08:15.739
I want you to know that I
am engaged to be married.

01:08:15.839 --> 01:08:18.814
I'm happy for you. Congratulations.

01:08:19.676 --> 01:08:23.781
I can see who's the lucky guy?
- The Baron Meinster.

01:08:23.881 --> 01:08:25.461
What?
- What is the problem?

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:27.856
Have you been here?
- Yes...

01:08:29.453 --> 01:08:33.872
...: - Did you kiss her? Please tell me.
- Just hand.

01:08:34.591 --> 01:08:37.219
Why is he doing that?

01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:41.206
Are you in love with him?
- Yes, I am.

01:08:42.131 --> 01:08:43.834
I see.

01:08:43.934 --> 01:08:47.096
I will hope for the best?
- Of course.

01:08:47.770 --> 01:08:51.191
When did you ever see?
- I'm not sure.

01:08:51.291 --> 01:08:53.291
I hope tomorrow.

01:08:55.679 --> 01:08:59.589
Are you ready, Dr. Tobler?
- Of course. Coming.

01:09:11.828 --> 01:09:16.419
If only to remain calm.
- Is the poor young lady there.

01:09:16.934 --> 01:09:19.823
No horse can hold a corpse nearby.

01:09:41.124 --> 01:09:42.459
Marianne.

01:09:42.559 --> 01:09:46.108
I came to see if I can come relieve
until Dr. Van Helsing.

01:09:46.207 --> 01:09:50.428
Really, dear? What kind of you.

01:09:52.202 --> 01:09:54.466
Not say no.

01:09:54.771 --> 01:09:59.361
Oh, dear, I'm almost as nervous
like those poor horses.

01:10:04.181 --> 01:10:06.228
Good night, Steadman.
- Good evening.

01:10:06.328 --> 01:10:10.833
Thank you again, Marianne. Good night.
- Good evening.

01:10:22.332 --> 01:10:27.007
Admiring the bronzes?
- The remains as bright and clean.

01:10:27.089 --> 01:10:31.473
You know, all these remind me
to the four seasons.

01:10:32.843 --> 01:10:34.660
This set here...

01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:36.893
Reminds me of spring in the field...

01:10:36.993 --> 01:10:40.040
Picnics, we swam in the streams...

01:10:40.350 --> 01:10:43.821
We dried ourselves in the sun.
- What's that?

01:10:43.921 --> 01:10:45.921
To Autumn.

01:10:47.157 --> 01:10:48.737
Gypsies...

01:10:48.837 --> 01:10:51.907
Galloping grass strips roads.

01:10:52.007 --> 01:10:54.557
Gorgeous guys, gorgeous girls.

01:10:56.700 --> 01:10:59.590
What about this one?
- When winter.

01:11:06.076 --> 01:11:08.237
Look at that now.

01:11:11.415 --> 01:11:12.663
You and I...

01:11:12.763 --> 01:11:16.399
Sleep deep in a coffin simple
and pretty maple or oak.

01:11:16.499 --> 01:11:20.855
Have to have cedar and always broncerÃ­a.

01:11:23.827 --> 01:11:25.827
Is closed.

01:11:32.102 --> 01:11:34.318
This is tight.

01:11:34.418 --> 01:11:37.896
SÃ©verin, can go find Herr Lang?

01:11:38.508 --> 01:11:42.333
I will, if you wish.
- Yes, I want it, please.

01:11:43.046 --> 01:11:46.276
Okay, but I warn that he did not like.

01:11:48.852 --> 01:11:51.588
Do not pay attention to the horses.

01:11:51.688 --> 01:11:54.384
Hold still, will you?

01:12:35.632 --> 01:12:39.398
Marianne, my dear Marianne.

01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:43.955
Do not you forget about your little Gina?

01:12:44.341 --> 01:12:49.356
Put your arms around me,
please. I wanna kiss you, Marianne.

01:12:50.113 --> 01:12:52.445
Please be nice to me.

01:12:54.351 --> 01:12:58.788
Say you forgive me for letting him love me.

01:13:17.741 --> 01:13:20.107
Both can love him, my dear.

01:13:20.210 --> 01:13:22.325
Now is there in the old mill.

01:13:22.425 --> 01:13:26.080
We can go together.
Come with me, Marianne.

01:13:38.095 --> 01:13:41.580
Bring brandy and hot water.
- Yes, doctor.

01:13:48.205 --> 01:13:50.205
Marianne...

01:13:50.373 --> 01:13:52.921
Saw who it was?

01:13:53.021 --> 01:13:55.911
It was horrible.
- You know, right?

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:59.030
It looked identical to Gina...

01:13:59.249 --> 01:14:01.134
Except...
- Was Gina.

01:14:01.234 --> 01:14:05.722
But it may have been. She's dead.
- Gina is now a living dead.

01:14:05.822 --> 01:14:09.226
She is the third victim
since released the Baron.

01:14:09.326 --> 01:14:12.144
Baron? You mean the Baron Meinster?
- Yes.

01:14:12.244 --> 01:14:13.613
Oh, no. I will not listen.

01:14:13.713 --> 01:14:16.745
Believe me I would not say such a thing, if
not totally sure.

01:14:16.845 --> 01:14:19.055
I find. Do you know where?

01:14:19.119 --> 01:14:20.616
No.
- Where is Marianne?

01:14:20.716 --> 01:14:22.841
If you know, you tell me.

01:14:23.306 --> 01:14:25.941
Marianne, where is it? Tell me.

01:14:26.376 --> 01:14:29.181
In the mill. In the old windmill.

01:14:36.553 --> 01:14:40.001
Marianne, please this rosary. The protect.

01:14:40.101 --> 01:14:42.542
And when I'm gone, I beg to enclose...

01:14:42.642 --> 01:14:46.807
And not
open the door to anyone. I must obey this.

01:14:47.597 --> 01:14:50.293
Take care of her.
- Yes, doctor.

01:17:15.545 --> 01:17:18.228
Go ahead and catch him.
Obey your master, catch it.

01:17:18.328 --> 01:17:20.328
Catch him.

01:22:26.422 --> 01:22:29.822
Brought someone to see you, Van Helsing.

01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:32.960
Beautiful, is not it?

01:22:33.363 --> 01:22:36.344
What a shame that so much
beauty should wither...

01:22:36.444 --> 01:22:38.480
Unless the preserve.

01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:43.935
She will be joining us, doctor,
and you will witness initiation.

01:22:44.674 --> 01:22:49.519
Marianne, do not make eye contact.
- Marianne, look at me.

01:23:08.298 --> 01:23:10.298
Marianne.
