WEBVTT

02:09.797 --> 02:11.173
Miriam.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.093
Go away, Richard!

02:14.218 --> 02:16.262
Hey, hey, I just
want to talk to you.

02:16.387 --> 02:17.888
I already told the police

02:18.013 --> 02:20.141
it was you who ran over
the little boy.

02:20.266 --> 02:22.852
- You already told the police?
- Yes!

02:24.103 --> 02:25.521
Stay away, Richard!

02:27.898 --> 02:29.191
Tell anybody else?

02:29.316 --> 02:30.609
No.

02:30.734 --> 02:32.486
But I don't know
why you're not arrested,

02:32.611 --> 02:34.780
so I also wrote a letter.

02:34.905 --> 02:36.198
What do you mean, a letter?

02:36.323 --> 02:37.700
I wrote a letter
to the sheriff,

02:37.825 --> 02:39.201
Sheriff Truman,
and mailed it,

02:39.326 --> 02:40.953
telling him
everything I know,

02:41.078 --> 02:43.455
and I told him
if anything happens to me,

02:43.581 --> 02:45.875
it was you who did it,
so...there!

02:47.668 --> 02:48.878
Sent that letter today?

02:49.003 --> 02:50.379
That's right.

03:01.682 --> 03:02.558
Come here!

03:02.683 --> 03:04.268
Come here!
Come here!

03:04.393 --> 03:06.312
Come here!

03:07.521 --> 03:09.106
Shut up!

03:49.063 --> 03:51.106
- Chad.
<i>- What's up?</i>

03:51.232 --> 03:52.441
Listen,
that little bitch Miriam

03:52.566 --> 03:53.943
sent a letter
to the sheriff today.

03:54.068 --> 03:55.819
You got to intercept
that motherfucker.

03:55.945 --> 03:58.530
<i>Oh, that ain't gonna be
real easy, Richard.</i>

03:58.656 --> 04:00.282
What a pussy you are!

04:00.407 --> 04:01.992
Don't let that fucking letter
get to the sheriff,

04:02.117 --> 04:03.953
you chickenshit,
or I'll fuck you up bad.

04:04.078 --> 04:06.288
<i>You're asking
a lot there, pal.</i>

04:06.413 --> 04:07.456
<i>I'll try.</i>

04:07.581 --> 04:08.791
You do more than try,
fuck face.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.167

06:18.754 --> 06:19.671
I don't tell you shit

06:19.797 --> 06:21.673
like why the fuck
you don't ask for a raise.

06:21.799 --> 06:24.093
How much money do you make,
anyways?

06:24.218 --> 06:25.761
You barely make minimum wage!

06:27.721 --> 06:29.515
We can't even afford
this shit hole.

06:31.308 --> 06:34.603
I don't tell you to clean
this fucking place up!

06:34.728 --> 06:37.106
- Don't you fucking move.
- Ah!

06:37.231 --> 06:39.024
Don't you fucking...

06:42.319 --> 06:45.614
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.450
Don't you give me
that fucking innocent look.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.452
I know exactly
what you did.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.246
Exactly what you did.

06:53.247 --> 06:55.457
You fuck...
Ah, shit...

08:57.454 --> 08:58.330
Ah!

08:58.455 --> 09:00.290
Oh! Shit!

09:00.415 --> 09:02.084
- I've hurt you!
- Candie!

09:02.209 --> 09:03.335
What happened?
What happened?

09:03.460 --> 09:05.754
I'm so sorry!
I'm sorry!

09:05.879 --> 09:08.340
Jesus!
Rodney, let me see that.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.592
- It's all right!
- Let me see this.

09:10.717 --> 09:11.927
Candie!

09:12.052 --> 09:13.679
What the fuck
did you do, Candie?

09:13.804 --> 09:16.139
- Get off. Get off!
- Get off of me!

09:16.265 --> 09:17.766
Candie! What the...

09:17.891 --> 09:19.851
- Jesus Christ.
- Easy. Easy.

09:19.977 --> 09:21.353
It's all right.
It's all right.

09:21.478 --> 09:23.188
It's gonna be all right.

09:23.313 --> 09:25.274
Ah, it's bleeding a little bit.

09:25.399 --> 09:26.275
Is it all right?
Is it bleeding?

09:26.400 --> 09:27.442
I got blood.
Is it bleeding?

09:27.568 --> 09:28.944
Get away, Candie!
Candie! Candie!

09:29.069 --> 09:30.404
Candie! Candie, let‒

09:31.446 --> 09:32.573
Dougie, have a seat.

09:34.950 --> 09:36.201
All right.

09:36.326 --> 09:38.370
I'll, uh, examine you
standing up.

09:39.830 --> 09:43.000
Anyway, as I told you, Dr. Ben,
it started last week

09:43.125 --> 09:45.544
when Dougie disappeared
for three days.

09:45.669 --> 09:47.296
He missed Sonny Jim's
birthday party,

09:47.421 --> 09:49.881
which we'd been planning
for six months,

09:50.007 --> 09:53.343
and then he shows up
straight from the casino.

09:53.468 --> 09:56.305
You know about
his gambling problems

09:56.430 --> 09:57.347
and then the drinking,

09:57.472 --> 09:58.765
and the drinking feeds
the gambling

09:58.890 --> 10:01.059
and vice versa,
and the whole thing

10:01.184 --> 10:03.478
is just a downward spiral.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.983
Dougie, have you
been exercising?

10:09.026 --> 10:10.402
Exercising.

10:11.153 --> 10:14.656
You have lost a good amount
of weight, also.

10:14.781 --> 10:18.118
- Also.
- Go on.

10:18.869 --> 10:20.996
Well, he's just...
I don't know...

10:21.121 --> 10:24.166
acting peculiar.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.835
Peeee-culiar.

10:35.177 --> 10:38.180
Uh, no, no, no.
Dougie, I got to listen here.

10:39.723 --> 10:41.516
Dougie.
No.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.561
Listen.
No, Dougie. Dougie.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.148
Okay.

10:48.857 --> 10:50.192
Well...

10:50.317 --> 10:52.778
Dougie, your heart and lungs
sound fantastic,

10:52.903 --> 10:56.823
so let's check
your blood pressure.

11:01.036 --> 11:02.621
How much weight has he lost?

11:02.746 --> 11:05.123
I-I-I think he's lost
a lot of weight.

11:05.248 --> 11:06.333
In a good way.

11:07.209 --> 11:09.628
Oh, yes.

11:09.753 --> 11:13.131
Dougie, last time I saw you,
you were quite overweight.

11:14.549 --> 11:16.051
- Weight?
- Yes.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.553
Overweight and, uh,
headed for trouble.

11:30.607 --> 11:32.567
One ten over 70.

11:32.693 --> 11:35.153
Perfect.

11:36.571 --> 11:37.739
Remarkable.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.040
Remarkable.

12:31.793 --> 12:34.629
Candie.
Candie, I'm fine.

12:34.755 --> 12:36.757
I-I'm okay.
It's...

12:47.601 --> 12:49.770
<i>- Paul, where do we go next?
- Roll the dice, Sheena.</i>

12:54.941 --> 12:57.319
<i>- Local news!
- Well, in local news,</i>

12:57.444 --> 13:00.155
<i>major excitement
at a downtown hotel today...</i>

13:00.280 --> 13:01.990
Brad. Brad!

13:02.115 --> 13:03.825
- Huh?
- They got Ike.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.452
<i>..."The Spike" Stadtler.</i>

13:06.286 --> 13:08.371
No shit.

13:08.497 --> 13:09.956
That asshole.

13:11.208 --> 13:13.627
Ike finally stepped
on his dick.

13:14.461 --> 13:17.005
Brad, remind me to call off
that hit on Ike.

13:17.798 --> 13:21.301
Save us a whack o' dough.
Nice!

13:22.177 --> 13:23.678
<i>Stadtler is a suspect</i>

13:23.804 --> 13:25.639

of gangland-related murders,</i>

<i>including an attempt
just yesterday</i>

<i>on the life
of this local businessman,</i>

13:29.643 --> 13:31.436
<i>Mr. Douglas Jones.</i>

13:32.354 --> 13:33.855
<i>Victim? Oh, no.</i>

13:33.980 --> 13:35.899
<i>That guy didn't act
like any victim.</i>

13:36.024 --> 13:38.193
<i>Douglas Jones</i>‒
<i>he moved like a cobra.</i>

13:38.318 --> 13:39.945
<i>All I saw was a blur.</i>

13:40.654 --> 13:43.573
<i>Then we came down,
and I was holding on to Dougie.</i>

13:43.698 --> 13:45.367
<i>We were having
a regular conversation</i>

13:45.492 --> 13:48.119
<i>about his money
and insurance and</i>‒<i>and</i>‒

13:48.245 --> 13:49.621
<i>No, Dougie, don't do that.</i>

13:49.746 --> 13:51.414
<i>And we were just walking along,</i>

13:51.540 --> 13:53.375
<i>minding our own business,
and I held on to him,</i>

13:53.500 --> 13:54.584
<i>and then, out of nowhere,</i>

13:54.709 --> 13:56.253
<i>someone came right at us,</i>

13:56.378 --> 13:58.129

<i>He wa</i>‒<i>he started</i>‒
<i>The gun went off,</i>

14:02.926 --> 14:06.054
<i>and it scared me,
and my Dougie,</i>

14:06.179 --> 14:09.057
<i>he gave him a good old
karate chop in the throat,</i>

14:09.182 --> 14:10.559
<i>and I punched him
a couple times.</i>

14:10.684 --> 14:13.395
<i>I said, "Don't you touch</i>‒
<i>Just get off him!</i>

14:13.520 --> 14:15.397
<i>Get off him!"
And then we</i>‒<i>he ran off!</i>

14:15.522 --> 14:18.942
<i>I don't know where he went,

14:19.067 --> 14:20.735
Freeze it there.

14:20.861 --> 14:22.445
<i>You just took care of business,
right, Doug</i>‒

14:23.864 --> 14:26.241
That's our Mr. Jackpots,
Rodney.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.535
I think you're right,
Bradley.

14:30.453 --> 14:31.746
Turns out,

14:31.872 --> 14:34.958
our Mr. Jones

14:35.083 --> 14:37.460
is actually...

14:37.586 --> 14:39.254
Mr. Jones.

14:40.797 --> 14:43.258
What a fuckin' world.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.263
How...

14:48.388 --> 14:49.764
can you ever...

14:49.890 --> 14:52.142
love me...

14:54.311 --> 14:58.023
...after what‒what I‒
what I did?

15:35.977 --> 15:37.145
Dougie.

15:43.693 --> 15:45.904
Do you find me attractive?

15:58.375 --> 15:59.459
Well?

16:00.460 --> 16:01.753
Do you?

16:13.890 --> 16:16.434
I find you attractive.

16:28.071 --> 16:29.656
Dougie.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.378
Dougie!
Oh, yes.

16:43.503 --> 16:46.214
Oh. Yes, Dougie.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.216
Yes.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.260
Dougie.

16:50.385 --> 16:52.554
Dougie! Dougie!

16:53.680 --> 16:57.392
Dougie. Dougie.

16:58.268 --> 16:59.686
Dougie!

17:00.395 --> 17:03.898
Dougie!
Dougie!

17:04.691 --> 17:05.817
Dougie!

17:07.694 --> 17:12.699
Dougiiieee!

17:18.913 --> 17:20.248
Dougie.

17:24.127 --> 17:25.670
Oh, Dougie.

17:43.063 --> 17:44.773
Dougie?

17:44.898 --> 17:46.483
I love you.

17:47.942 --> 17:49.402
Love you.

17:57.994 --> 18:00.121
Dougie.

18:36.324 --> 18:39.035
<i>And the fucks are at it again!</i>

18:39.160 --> 18:42.747
<i>Fuck you who betray the people
you were elected to help!</i>

18:42.872 --> 18:46.501
We're sheep to these monsters,
and they don't give a shit!

18:46.626 --> 18:48.002
We grow our wool,

18:48.128 --> 18:50.171
and just when
we're getting warm,

18:50.296 --> 18:52.757
they come along
with their electric clippers

18:52.882 --> 18:54.759
and shear our wool off,

18:54.884 --> 18:58.346
and we're just naked,
screaming little fucks!

18:58.471 --> 19:00.849
No wool for us!

19:00.974 --> 19:02.767
Freezing and hungry!

19:02.892 --> 19:05.270
<i>In the night.
In the dark.</i>

19:05.395 --> 19:07.564
And they don't give a shit!

19:07.689 --> 19:09.190
Then when we get sick,

19:09.315 --> 19:12.360
the pharmaceutical companies
make billions!

19:12.485 --> 19:14.320
They own the fucking hospitals.

19:14.445 --> 19:15.780
<i>Filled to the brim.</i>

19:15.905 --> 19:17.407
They own the morgues!

19:17.532 --> 19:19.576
They own the embalming fluids!

19:19.701 --> 19:22.036
They own the mortuaries,
the graveyards!

19:22.162 --> 19:23.997
These fucks!

19:42.682 --> 19:45.560
<i>Is it the government's business
who we marry?</i>

19:45.685 --> 19:48.271
<i>What the fuck do we care
what the government thinks</i>

19:48.396 --> 19:49.898
about who we marry?

19:50.023 --> 19:52.150
Are we gonna invite them
to the wedding?

19:52.275 --> 19:53.776
Fuck no!

19:53.902 --> 19:55.403
Oh, they wouldn't come anyway.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.614
They're‒they're too busy fucking!

19:57.739 --> 19:59.449
Fucking us
at the grocery store!

19:59.574 --> 20:00.783
At the bank!

20:00.909 --> 20:02.243
<i>At the gas pump!</i>

20:02.368 --> 20:04.245
<i>They're feeding our children
chemical shit</i>

20:04.370 --> 20:06.748
coated in sugar!

20:06.873 --> 20:08.625
Why don't these monsters

20:08.750 --> 20:11.461
bite into those tasty treats
themselves?

20:11.586 --> 20:14.255
'Cause they'll die
in the streets!

20:14.380 --> 20:15.673
Just like us!

20:15.798 --> 20:16.966
And then they'll bloat

20:17.091 --> 20:19.302
like a big red fucking balloon.

20:19.427 --> 20:21.012
Stop!

20:21.137 --> 20:22.805
Stop distracting yourself

20:22.931 --> 20:25.183
with all this
diverting bullshit,

20:25.308 --> 20:27.852
<i>and pay attention.</i>

20:27.977 --> 20:29.103
<i>Save the children!</i>

20:29.229 --> 20:32.482
Every parent wants
to save their child.

20:32.607 --> 20:34.525
Buy yourself a shovel,

20:34.651 --> 20:37.278
dig yourself out of the shit,

20:37.403 --> 20:39.530
and get educated!

20:39.656 --> 20:41.991
Oh, he's so beautiful.

20:45.578 --> 20:46.829
Sonny Jim,

20:46.955 --> 20:48.331
go get in the car.

20:55.088 --> 20:57.799
I can't stop thinking
about last night.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.469
You're so wonderful.

21:02.428 --> 21:04.597
- Wonderful.
- Mm.

21:09.102 --> 21:11.562
I just had to tell you that.

21:12.981 --> 21:15.441
Okay. Let's get you to work.

21:35.753 --> 21:40.008
You can't fool me!

21:40.133 --> 21:42.719
I've been here before!

21:59.986 --> 22:02.322
What are you doing
up here, Chad?

22:02.447 --> 22:03.865
I'm...thinking

22:03.990 --> 22:06.075
what a beautiful day
it is, Lucy.

22:06.200 --> 22:09.037
I'll bet you're a girl
who appreciates a beautiful day.

22:09.162 --> 22:11.205
- Well...
- I bet you and Andy

22:11.331 --> 22:13.374
wake up each morning
and say,

22:13.499 --> 22:15.793
"Oh, what a beautiful day it is."

22:16.919 --> 22:19.630
That depends
on what time it is.

22:19.756 --> 22:22.592
I mean, sometimes
there's not even enough time

22:22.717 --> 22:24.677
to think of anything.

22:25.553 --> 22:28.264
One time,
Andy was even thinking

22:28.389 --> 22:31.225
that the clock had stopped,

22:31.351 --> 22:34.228
and then we realized
that we didn't even know

22:34.354 --> 22:36.731
what time it was.

22:36.856 --> 22:40.068
It seemed like forever.

22:40.193 --> 22:41.819
- When‒
- Oh.

22:41.944 --> 22:43.613
I'm going out, Lucy.

22:43.738 --> 22:45.740
I-I see the mailman.
I'm gonna collect the mail.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.242
But he'll bring it in.

22:48.368 --> 22:50.244
Well, I'm gonna save him
the trouble

22:50.370 --> 22:52.497
and go out and enjoy
this beautiful day.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.720
<i>Ah, thank you so much.</i>

23:51.681 --> 23:53.141
Beautiful day.

23:53.266 --> 23:55.685
This calls
for another doughnut.

24:40.396 --> 24:43.608
<i>Hello, Johnny.
How are you today?</i>

24:45.610 --> 24:48.613
<i>Hello, Johnny.
How are you today?</i>

24:49.780 --> 24:53.242
<i>Hello, Johnny.
How are you today?</i>

24:55.077 --> 24:57.788
<i>Hello, Johnny.
How are you today?</i>

24:57.914 --> 25:00.917
<i>Uh, Mrs. Horne?</i>

25:01.042 --> 25:03.836
<i>Your grandson, Richard,
is on his way in.</i>

25:05.505 --> 25:08.841
<i>Hello, Johnny.
How are you today?</i>

25:10.510 --> 25:13.846
<i>Hello, Johnny.
How are you today?</i>

25:24.732 --> 25:27.193
Don't even think of getting out
of your car, Richard.

25:27.318 --> 25:30.071
- Came to see you, Grandma.
- Stay away!

25:30.196 --> 25:32.657
- Or I'll call the sheriff!
- Come on, Grandma.

25:32.782 --> 25:34.909
No! Stop it!

25:35.034 --> 25:36.577
I just want a couple of dollars.

25:36.702 --> 25:37.537
No!

25:37.662 --> 25:38.746
Just want
a couple of dollars.

25:38.871 --> 25:41.415
No. Go ask your grandfather.

25:41.541 --> 25:43.417
He won't give you any more,
will he?

25:44.085 --> 25:47.338
<i>- Hello, Johnny.</i>
- I got money, but I want more.

25:47.463 --> 25:49.757
You always wanted me
to leave town, right?

25:49.882 --> 25:51.634
So help me out,
and I'll be out of here.

25:51.759 --> 25:54.178
Don't come any closer, Richard.
I mean it.

25:54.303 --> 25:56.597
- Money, Grandma!
- No!

25:56.722 --> 25:59.100
<i>Hello, Johnny.
How are you today?</i>

25:59.225 --> 26:01.018
Oh, Johnny!

26:01.143 --> 26:02.520
<i>Hello, Johnny.</i>

26:02.645 --> 26:07.316
I...I will squeeze the shit
out of you, bitch!

26:07.441 --> 26:09.318
<i>How are you today?</i>

26:09.443 --> 26:11.362
You cocksucking bitch!

26:11.487 --> 26:13.281
And I'll cornhole
that piece of shit!

26:13.406 --> 26:14.490
<i>How are you today?</i>

26:14.615 --> 26:17.952
Now give me some fucking money!

26:18.077 --> 26:19.787
In‒in my purse!

26:19.912 --> 26:21.539
Not your purse, bitch!

26:21.664 --> 26:23.791
The safe.
The combination.

26:23.916 --> 26:26.043
- <i>How are you today?</i>
- The combination!

26:26.168 --> 26:29.213
- What did you do?
- What?

26:29.338 --> 26:31.632
- Four...
- What? Fucking speak up.

26:31.757 --> 26:34.468
I cannot understand
a <i>fucking</i> thing you're saying.

26:34.594 --> 26:37.638
Nine...zero...four...

26:37.763 --> 26:41.058
<i>Hello, Johnny.
How are you today?</i>

26:41.183 --> 26:42.143
...seven.

26:46.522 --> 26:47.356
Stay there!

26:47.481 --> 26:50.401
<i>Hello, Johnny.
How are you today?</i>

26:51.944 --> 26:54.739
<i>Hello, Johnny.
How are you today?</i>

26:54.864 --> 26:56.949
Oh, Johnny.

26:57.617 --> 26:59.535
<i>Hello, Johnny.
How are you today?</i>

27:01.454 --> 27:03.706
Oh, I'm so sorry.

27:03.831 --> 27:06.125
- Look at you.
<i>- How are you today?</i>

27:07.126 --> 27:09.420
Oh, we can't make him mad.

27:09.545 --> 27:11.172
<i>How are you today?</i>

27:13.799 --> 27:16.802
<i>Hello, Johnny.
How are you today?</i>

27:19.472 --> 27:22.558
<i>Hello, Johnny.
How are you today?</i>

27:25.478 --> 27:28.522
<i>Hello, Johnny.
How are you today?</i>

27:29.982 --> 27:32.943
<i>Hello, Johnny.
How are you today?</i>

27:34.987 --> 27:37.990
<i>Hello, Johnny.
How are you today?</i>

27:38.824 --> 27:40.242
Oh, my God.

27:40.368 --> 27:43.245
<i>Hello, Johnny.
How are you today?</i>

27:44.664 --> 27:46.207
Johnny...

27:46.332 --> 27:49.210
<i>Hello, Johnny.
How are you today?</i>

27:52.338 --> 27:55.383
<i>Hello, Johnny.
How are you today?</i>

27:57.259 --> 28:00.638
<i>Hello, Johnny.
How are you today?</i>

28:03.182 --> 28:06.268
<i>Hello, Johnny.
How are you today?</i>

28:09.021 --> 28:12.191
<i>Hello, Johnny.
How are you today?</i>

28:14.235 --> 28:17.446
<i>Hello, Johnny.
How are you today?</i>

28:18.864 --> 28:20.282
Yeah.

28:20.408 --> 28:22.326
Yeah, I will take your purse.

28:23.202 --> 28:24.745
Here.

28:24.870 --> 28:27.039
<i>Hello, Johnny.
How are you today?</i>

28:28.124 --> 28:32.086
Why you have to make something
so simple so fucking difficult?

28:32.211 --> 28:33.087
Cunt.

28:33.212 --> 28:36.924
<i>Hello, Johnny.
How are you today?</i>

28:38.884 --> 28:40.803
<i>Hello, Johnny.
How are you today?</i>

28:40.928 --> 28:43.472
Oh, Johnny.
Oh, Johnny.

28:43.597 --> 28:46.434
<i>Hello, Johnny.
How are you today?</i>

28:48.227 --> 28:51.230
<i>Hello, Johnny.
How are you today?</i>

28:52.898 --> 28:56.068
<i>Hello, Johnny.
How are you today?</i>

29:07.121 --> 29:08.998
It's true.

29:09.123 --> 29:10.458
It's all over the news.

29:10.583 --> 29:12.084
They got Ike.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.211
Okay.

29:14.336 --> 29:15.463
Thank you, Roger.

29:22.428 --> 29:23.262
Anthony, come here.

29:40.196 --> 29:41.614
Don't sit down, Anthony.

29:44.325 --> 29:45.451
Anthony, I asked you here

29:45.576 --> 29:47.077
because you're
a creative individual,

29:47.203 --> 29:48.746
and you're gonna need
every ounce of that creativity

29:48.871 --> 29:50.790
to do what I'm about
to tell you.

29:52.333 --> 29:53.918
What's that, Mr. Todd?

29:54.043 --> 29:55.920
Do you recall my business rivals
and bitter enemies

29:56.045 --> 29:57.296
the Mitchum brothers?

29:59.590 --> 30:01.550
You're gonna visit
the brothers now.

30:01.675 --> 30:03.594
You're gonna pin the blame
for the insurance claim

30:03.719 --> 30:05.054
that we conspired
to deny for them,

30:05.179 --> 30:07.598
a loss of 30 million
that hit 'em hard,

30:07.723 --> 30:09.725
on the back of Douglas Jones.

30:09.850 --> 30:11.685
You're gonna convince them
that Mr. Jones

30:11.811 --> 30:13.896
has it out for the brothers,
a personal vendetta,

30:14.021 --> 30:16.524
and then we're gonna sit back,
and we're gonna watch

30:16.649 --> 30:17.858
as the Mitchum brothers

30:17.983 --> 30:20.194
take care
of our Mr. Jones problem.

30:23.864 --> 30:25.616
- But what if‒
- Don't speak, Anthony.

30:25.741 --> 30:28.285
If you fail to deliver on this,

30:28.410 --> 30:30.496
then you'll have to kill
Mr. Jones yourself.

31:03.779 --> 31:04.905
Albert

31:05.030 --> 31:06.448
and the lady
from the morgue.

31:12.037 --> 31:14.373
- Sweet.
- Sweet.

31:15.291 --> 31:20.004
Yes. Yes, I...

31:21.881 --> 31:23.507
Come on.

31:39.565 --> 31:41.567
What's he want?

31:44.028 --> 31:45.946
- Who?
- That insurance fuck.

31:46.071 --> 31:47.239
It's after midnight.

31:48.741 --> 31:50.451
The bastard.

31:50.576 --> 31:52.328
I could throw a car farther

31:52.453 --> 31:54.496
than I'd trust that rat fuck.

31:55.915 --> 31:57.917
<i>Anthony Sinclair here
to see you.</i>

31:58.918 --> 32:00.628
Stay put.

32:00.753 --> 32:02.129
We'll come get him.

32:02.254 --> 32:03.255
Candie.

32:04.256 --> 32:06.133
Candie, go get him.

32:12.598 --> 32:13.849
Candie!

32:13.974 --> 32:15.392
Yes, sir.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.314
Candie, go get him.

32:20.439 --> 32:22.274
You want me to bring him here?

32:23.108 --> 32:24.151
Yeah.

32:24.944 --> 32:26.320
What did he just say?

32:26.445 --> 32:29.907
You want me to get him
and bring him here?

33:59.371 --> 34:00.748
What the fuck?

34:00.873 --> 34:02.708
Did we ask her to tell him
her life story?

34:02.833 --> 34:04.626
For four fuckin' hours?

34:06.253 --> 34:07.337
Warrick?

34:08.797 --> 34:11.091
Send Candie in here,
with him, now.

34:11.216 --> 34:13.719
Now!

34:15.471 --> 34:16.555
<i>Candie.</i>

34:17.890 --> 34:19.099
<i>They're ready.</i>

34:26.231 --> 34:27.357
<i>She's on her way.</i>

34:30.235 --> 34:31.570
- I know.
- We fire her,

34:31.695 --> 34:33.530
- she's got no place to go.
- I know. I...

34:49.588 --> 34:50.714
Here he is.

34:59.473 --> 35:01.475
What the fuck
were you guys talking about?

35:02.184 --> 35:03.644
She was talking.

35:03.769 --> 35:06.105
- Candie?
- Hmm?

35:07.356 --> 35:10.818
What were you talking about
to him

35:10.943 --> 35:13.112
out there on the floor?

35:16.031 --> 35:17.032
Candie!

35:22.371 --> 35:23.580
Um...

35:25.624 --> 35:27.376
Oh...

35:27.501 --> 35:30.712
that we're in the version layer,

35:30.838 --> 35:33.966
that it's gonna be hot
and smoggy tomorrow.

35:35.551 --> 35:38.178
And I told him
that we are so lucky

35:38.303 --> 35:40.597
to have air-conditioning
cooling our casino.

35:46.353 --> 35:49.898
Okay. Mr. Insurance Man,
what do you want?

35:50.023 --> 35:51.441
Mr. Mitchum.

35:52.985 --> 35:53.986
Mr. Mitchum.

35:57.030 --> 36:01.076
I'm here
to tell you something

36:01.201 --> 36:03.537
that you will want
to know about.

36:05.414 --> 36:06.665
- Yeah?
- What's that?

36:06.790 --> 36:08.375
Your new hotel,
which burned

36:08.500 --> 36:10.794
badly down to the ground
a few months back,

36:10.919 --> 36:13.422
was ruled arson

36:13.547 --> 36:15.507
by an official investigation.

36:15.632 --> 36:18.802
Now, I may have sold you
your policy, sirs,

36:18.927 --> 36:20.512
but I didn't handle the claim.

36:21.471 --> 36:23.265
It was done by Douglas Jones,

36:23.390 --> 36:24.683
who works at our firm.

36:26.685 --> 36:28.604
- Douglas Jones.
- I thought you should know

36:28.729 --> 36:31.190
from me, unofficially,

36:31.315 --> 36:34.234
on my own...

36:36.695 --> 36:40.741
...that this Mr. Jones
did everything in his power

36:40.866 --> 36:42.910
to prevent you gentlemen

36:43.035 --> 36:44.578
from getting
the insurance relief

36:44.703 --> 36:45.913
from the loss you suffered

36:46.038 --> 36:48.707
that I believe to this day
you deserved.

36:50.125 --> 36:52.252
Douglas Jones

36:52.377 --> 36:57.090
seems to have
a <i>personal vendetta</i>

36:57.216 --> 36:58.675
against you.

36:59.551 --> 37:01.345
And he still insists

37:01.470 --> 37:03.847
that that claim
will never be paid out,

37:03.972 --> 37:05.474
and he'll do everything
in his power

37:05.599 --> 37:08.227
to make sure
that it never happens.

37:12.272 --> 37:14.399
- Yeah?
- Is that it?

37:16.652 --> 37:17.778
Yes, sir.

37:22.950 --> 37:26.578
You have an enemy
in Douglas Jones.

37:27.412 --> 37:29.581
That's what I came to tell you.

37:30.832 --> 37:33.710
Candie, show him out.

37:39.716 --> 37:40.926
Candie!

37:55.774 --> 37:59.987
You have an <i>enemy...</i>
in Douglas Jones.

38:53.874 --> 38:57.502
Now I know...
how Brando felt.

39:04.926 --> 39:07.220
Calling him tomorrow,

39:07.346 --> 39:10.182
this Douglas Jones...

39:12.684 --> 39:14.353
...to set up a meeting.

39:16.938 --> 39:18.607
Right you are, Rodney.

39:20.025 --> 39:22.694
- Right you are.
- He took us...

39:24.780 --> 39:27.741
...for 30 million...

39:29.534 --> 39:34.164
447 thousand...

39:34.289 --> 39:35.499
dollars.

39:41.088 --> 39:42.422
Motherfucker.

39:45.425 --> 39:47.886
You fuck us once,
shame on us.

39:50.389 --> 39:53.350
You fuck us twice,

39:53.475 --> 39:54.893
shame on you.

39:56.311 --> 39:57.562
You're dead.

40:06.571 --> 40:07.572
Yeah.

40:52.659 --> 40:54.911
<i>Laura!</i>

41:03.628 --> 41:04.588
Albert.

41:04.713 --> 41:06.381
Come on in.

41:26.818 --> 41:28.778
Diane received this text
on her phone

41:28.904 --> 41:31.031
at 11:13 this morning.

41:33.200 --> 41:36.828
"Around the dinner table,
the conversation is lively."

41:38.538 --> 41:40.832
Now, that came in
after Cooper escaped.

41:41.791 --> 41:43.877
It pinged off a cell tower
in Philly, so at first,

41:44.002 --> 41:46.254
I thought it was
one of her boyfriends‒

41:46.379 --> 41:49.299
seems she has a stable
of male suitors‒

41:49.424 --> 41:51.718
but Tammy traced this one back
from there

41:51.843 --> 41:53.678
to a server in Mexico.

41:54.346 --> 41:55.514
Mexico?

41:58.517 --> 42:00.060
Did she respond?

42:01.019 --> 42:05.148
She sent the following
heavily encrypted message:

42:05.273 --> 42:07.484
"They have Hastings.

42:07.609 --> 42:09.861
He's going to take them
to the site."

42:11.947 --> 42:14.032
Doesn't sound like
boyfriend talk.

42:15.242 --> 42:18.078
I felt it when she hugged me,

42:18.203 --> 42:19.913
but this confirms it.

42:20.956 --> 42:22.415
What should we do?

42:23.375 --> 42:24.918
Keep her close.

42:35.387 --> 42:38.014
Damn.

42:42.310 --> 42:44.271
- Tammy.
- Gordon.

42:44.396 --> 42:45.814
Come on in.

42:54.948 --> 42:56.324
You remember
the penthouse murders

42:56.449 --> 42:57.534
in New York City?

42:57.659 --> 42:59.369
Yes?

42:59.494 --> 43:02.289
This was just found
on one of the earliest cards.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.418
Damn!

43:11.923 --> 43:13.758
This is something.

43:14.801 --> 43:17.762
This is really something.

43:23.018 --> 43:24.811
<i>What</i> did he do?

43:24.936 --> 43:27.022
<i>He came in and attacked us</i>

43:27.147 --> 43:30.358
<i>and stole all my money!</i>

43:30.483 --> 43:32.444
Oh, damn it.

43:34.613 --> 43:36.239
Is Johnny okay?

43:36.364 --> 43:38.742
<i>No concerns for me, as usual.</i>

43:38.867 --> 43:41.745
<i>What do you mean, Johnny?
It was me he attacked.</i>

43:41.870 --> 43:43.747
Sylvia, of course

43:43.872 --> 43:46.124
I'm concerned about you too.

43:47.334 --> 43:48.835
How much money did he take?

43:48.960 --> 43:50.337
<i>Everything I had in the safe,</i>

43:50.462 --> 43:51.838
<i>thousands of dollars,</i>

43:51.963 --> 43:54.007
<i>and you're going
to make this up to me.</i>

43:54.132 --> 43:58.178
No, I am not sending you
any more money, Sylvia!

43:58.303 --> 44:00.347
<i>Yes, you are!</i>

44:00.472 --> 44:02.515
- Sylvia!
<i>- Yes, you are.</i>

44:02.641 --> 44:05.060
<i>I'm calling my lawyer
right now.</i>

44:17.197 --> 44:18.406
Beverly?

44:22.369 --> 44:24.371
Do you want to have dinner
with me?

44:31.544 --> 44:32.879
Hawk.

44:34.547 --> 44:37.175
Electricity is humming.

44:38.051 --> 44:41.805
<i>You hear it
in the mountains and rivers.</i>

44:42.764 --> 44:43.890
<i>You see it dance</i>

44:44.015 --> 44:48.311
among the seas and stars

44:48.436 --> 44:52.107
and glowing around the moon,

44:52.232 --> 44:55.443
but in these days,

44:55.568 --> 44:58.238
the glow is dying.

45:00.740 --> 45:04.160
What will be in the darkness
that remains?

45:07.247 --> 45:11.876
The Truman brothers
are both true men.

45:14.462 --> 45:16.715
They are your brothers.

45:19.884 --> 45:22.053
<i>And the others,</i>

45:22.178 --> 45:25.682
the good ones
who have been with you.

45:27.058 --> 45:30.687
Now the circle
is almost complete.

45:32.605 --> 45:34.774
Watch and listen

45:34.899 --> 45:37.944
to the dream of time

45:38.069 --> 45:39.904
and space.

45:42.323 --> 45:46.911
It all comes out now,
flowing like a river.

45:50.582 --> 45:54.586
<i>That which is and is not.</i>

45:56.755 --> 45:57.756
