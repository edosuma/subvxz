00:08.710 --> 00:10.780
Day of the Dead
ALLENDE DEL SOL, MEXICO

01:00.670 --> 01:01.819
Miguel!

01:41.040 --> 01:43.167
Miguel! Miguel!

03:12.000 --> 03:15.117
Hey, what's that about

03:15.500 --> 03:20.369
It's okay. It's okay. I'm a little grumpy
when I wake up sometimes, too.

03:23.380 --> 03:26.747
That's great, you guys.
See what you did?

03:28.120 --> 03:29.326
Here.

03:29.330 --> 03:30.536
-I got him. Yeah, it's okay.

03:30.540 --> 03:32.576
-Okay.
-Can you grab that? Thanks.

03:33.330 --> 03:37.118
-You're holding him like a cantaloupe.
-What

03:37.120 --> 03:38.997
Okay, smarty pants, knock yourself out.

03:39.330 --> 03:42.117
There we go. It's okay. It's for the...

03:45.460 --> 03:48.418
All right, let's see you profile
a disorganized psychopath.

03:48.420 --> 03:50.035
It's your wife.

03:53.330 --> 03:54.536
Hey,

03:54.540 --> 03:55.746
I know you're taking the weekend,

03:55.750 --> 03:57.411
but I wanted to let you know
we got a call...

03:59.500 --> 04:01.115
Amazing.

04:01.120 --> 04:03.532
I am so glad you're here, sis.

04:03.540 --> 04:04.950
And with you coming to town,

04:04.960 --> 04:07.918
it's been so much _easier
to get him to take time off.

04:07.920 --> 04:10.957
And I never could have prepared
a meal like that by myself.

04:16.580 --> 04:17.740
Go.

04:18.210 --> 04:19.495
Honey, it's just a briefing.

04:19.500 --> 04:20.876
A couple of hours and I'll be back,
okay?

04:20.880 --> 04:22.416
It's okay. Go.

04:24.040 --> 04:27.703
They need you. It's all right.
I'm not mad. Go.

04:31.080 --> 04:33.241
You heard her. She said it was all right.

04:34.500 --> 04:36.320
You're one hell of a profiler.

04:37.620 --> 04:39.497
Allende Del Sol, Mexico,
population 20,000.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.877
F.B.I., Headquarters
QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

04:41.880 --> 04:44.030
The victim is Lupe Trejo, 62.

04:44.040 --> 04:47.373
She was found in her home stabbed
in the face, chest and genitals.

04:47.380 --> 04:49.416
The papers down there
connected her murder

04:49.420 --> 04:52.412
to 11 others in the past two years,
all elderly women.

04:52.420 --> 04:54.911
They're saying
it's the work of a serial killer.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.706
Mexican government disagrees.

04:56.710 --> 04:58.029
What kind of city is this?

04:58.040 --> 05:00.110
Half factory town, half tourist town.

05:00.120 --> 05:02.668
The factory makes the tchotchkes
and clothes the tourists buy,

05:02.670 --> 05:04.206
and even though all the murders
have happened

05:04.210 --> 05:06.166
in the poorer neighborhoods
where the locals live...

05:06.170 --> 05:08.070
Serial killers make
lousy tourist attractions.

05:08.080 --> 05:09.536
-Yeah.
-So if the government denies

05:09.540 --> 05:12.668
that this is a serial killer,
why'd they call us?

05:12.670 --> 05:15.116
They have a suspect in custody,
the victim's son.

05:15.120 --> 05:16.951
We're the serial killer experts,

05:16.960 --> 05:18.700
they want us to go down there
and confirm

05:18.710 --> 05:20.610
that this was just a onetime killing.

05:20.620 --> 05:22.417
Put the serial killer angle to bed.

05:22.420 --> 05:24.115
So, we're going all the way down there
just to prove

05:24.120 --> 05:25.371
they don't have a serial killer?

05:25.380 --> 05:27.746
Maybe. Or we're going down there
to tell them

05:27.750 --> 05:29.570
if what I've read in the Mexican papers
is true,

05:29.580 --> 05:32.913
they've got one of the worst
serial killers the country's ever seen.

05:32.920 --> 05:34.490
Let's go.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.787
Hotch, call from the car.

06:22.210 --> 06:23.746
Anthony Brandt wrote,

06:23.750 --> 06:27.868
"Other things may change us,
but we start and end with family."

06:30.880 --> 06:35.203
Hey, at least you get to spend
your birthday weekend in Mexico.

06:35.210 --> 06:37.030
Yeah, what's "doghouse" in Spanish?

06:40.170 --> 06:41.319
That's what I said.

06:41.330 --> 06:44.322
Face it, chico,you are only a genius in English.

06:44.330 --> 06:46.036
Spanish

06:46.040 --> 06:47.530
I'm full of hidden mysteries.

06:47.540 --> 06:50.703
All right, so why are there
so few serial killers in Mexico?

06:50.710 --> 06:52.325
They probably have as many as we do,

06:52.330 --> 06:53.877
but they document
almost none of them.

06:53.880 --> 06:56.826
-Why is that?
-It's the Chikatilo Syndrome.

06:56.830 --> 06:58.741
-The what?
-Andrei Chikatilo,

06:58.750 --> 07:01.617
he was one of the most prolific
serial killers of the 20th century.

07:01.620 --> 07:04.077
By the time they found him,
he'd killed more than 50 people.

07:04.080 --> 07:06.742
He was no more experienced
than any average serial killer,

07:06.750 --> 07:08.456
but lived in the Soviet Ukraine.

07:08.460 --> 07:13.875
Soviets were convinced serial killers,
uniquely American phenomenon.

07:14.540 --> 07:17.418
Inevitable result of decadent capitalism.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.491
So what's the cultural bias in Mexico?

07:20.500 --> 07:21.740
Many Mexicans believe that

07:21.750 --> 07:24.457
serial killers are the result
of the breakdown of the family,

07:24.460 --> 07:26.997
which gives rise to the kind of
alienated loner

07:27.000 --> 07:28.240
who becomes a serial killer.

07:28.250 --> 07:32.163
It's a fact there are 12 times as many
broken families in the US

07:32.170 --> 07:33.535
than in Mxico.

07:33.540 --> 07:38.113
All right, so is it possible there are
fewer serial killers in Mexican culture?

07:38.120 --> 07:40.372
It is possible, but in my experience,

07:40.380 --> 07:43.998
evil is not a cultural phenomenon,
it's a human one.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.536
Nothing like jet sleep, right?

08:02.540 --> 08:06.453
Yeah, kind of like a night of drinking
without the drinking.

08:09.420 --> 08:11.820
-Agent Gideon.
-Captain Navarro.

08:12.210 --> 08:14.246
You're shorter than I remember.

08:14.250 --> 08:15.569
Oh, I was on a stage.

08:15.580 --> 08:17.116
This is Lieutenant Borquez.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.326
-Hel_lo.
-Hl.

08:18.330 --> 08:19.877
This is my team.

08:19.880 --> 08:21.700
Captain Navarro's been put in charge
of the case

08:21.710 --> 08:23.996
-by the district attorney general.
-You guys got history?

08:24.000 --> 08:26.491
No, we met at a seminar I gave
in Mexico City a few years ago.

08:26.500 --> 08:28.661
"Sexual homicide in Latin America."

08:28.670 --> 08:31.491
I just read a chapter on the subject
in Max Ryan's book.

08:31.500 --> 08:34.116
Where do you think I got it from?

08:34.120 --> 08:37.169
I'm glad you came. I was never sure
how much you liked me.

08:37.170 --> 08:39.035
Why is that?

08:39.040 --> 08:40.280
I have often told Agent Gideon

08:40.290 --> 08:44.078
that his profiling technique would not
translate accurately in Latin culture

08:44.080 --> 08:46.457
without a better understanding
of our cultural values.

08:46.460 --> 08:48.246
Now's a good time to find out, right?

08:48.250 --> 08:50.741
Captain, I'd like to get a handle
on the type of press

08:50.750 --> 08:52.741
this has been getting and meet
some of your local police here.

08:52.750 --> 08:55.617
Of course, but I imagine you would all
like to settle into your rooms

08:55.620 --> 08:58.612
-and rest before we go?
-Nope. We're ready.

08:59.120 --> 09:00.576
Let's go.

09:10.670 --> 09:13.116
English. English, por favor, English.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.826
I was explaining to Agent Gideon

09:14.830 --> 09:16.821
that his profiling theory
doesn't take into account

09:16.830 --> 09:19.663
two powerful influences
on Mexican culture,

09:19.670 --> 09:22.286
which is family and machismo.

09:24.250 --> 09:26.320
You know,
you have some interesting ideas.

09:26.330 --> 09:28.742
The district attorney general
put me in charge of this killing

09:28.750 --> 09:31.492
when she realized
we had a relationship.

09:31.500 --> 09:35.163
She had me invite you down to help us
settle this mess.

09:35.500 --> 09:37.411
You are aware _
that we may not be gIVIng you

09:37.420 --> 09:39.991
the answer you're looking for
on this one, yes?

09:40.000 --> 09:41.570
You think the papers are right?

09:41.580 --> 09:43.821
What are they saying exactly?

09:46.580 --> 09:51.700
"There's a serial assassin who's killing
elderly women in local towns

09:51.710 --> 09:55.282
"and the attorney general
and the authorities are moving slowly."

09:55.620 --> 09:56.996
We'll see.

10:16.250 --> 10:17.615
What's all this?

10:18.790 --> 10:21.076
Day of the Dead.
Three-day Latin holiday

10:21.080 --> 10:23.662
where souls of dead relatives
are said to return to earth

10:23.670 --> 10:25.991
to enjoy the pleasures
that they once knew of.

10:27.330 --> 10:29.286
He sounds like
he was reading that out of a book.

10:29.290 --> 10:30.917
Trust me, he always sounds like that.

10:30.920 --> 10:34.242
Actually, I was reading.
I picked this pamphlet up at the airport.

10:41.960 --> 10:44.781
As profilers, I thought you'd want to see
the crime scene first

10:44.790 --> 10:47.532
before meeting the suspects. Yes?

10:47.540 --> 10:50.202
You remembered something
from my lecture, huh?

10:50.210 --> 10:52.667
Actually, I got it from your mentor,
Max Ryan.

10:52.670 --> 10:54.570
His book, it's a great read.

10:56.080 --> 10:58.742
The victim's name is Lupe Trejo, 62.

10:58.750 --> 11:01.071
She was found in the bedroom
by the daughter.

11:01.080 --> 11:02.320
No sign of forced entry.

11:02.330 --> 11:03.786
Are there always
this many people around?

11:03.790 --> 11:05.280
No. Church just got out.

11:05.290 --> 11:06.871
They are walking home
from the town square.

11:06.880 --> 11:08.165
What time was she killed?

11:08.170 --> 11:10.286
I am guessing
sometime during the evening mass.

11:10.290 --> 11:12.167
There wouldn't have been
a lot of people around,

11:12.170 --> 11:13.876
otherwise he would have been seen.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.819
Let's go.

11:22.830 --> 11:25.572
No forced entry means
one of two things.

11:25.580 --> 11:29.949
A push-in. Holds a gun or a knife to her
and forces his way inside.

11:29.960 --> 11:31.166
The murder weapon, the knife,

11:31.170 --> 11:33.411
was taken from the kitchen
and placed at the scene.

11:33.420 --> 11:36.457
In that case, it's most likely
that she let the killer in voluntarily.

11:36.460 --> 11:38.997
She looked through the peephole,
saw someone she recognized.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.456
Someone who makes her feel safe.

11:40.460 --> 11:41.870
She lets him in and then what?

11:42.250 --> 11:45.742
They have a drink. Have you run
a DNA analysis on these?

11:45.750 --> 11:47.706
The closest thing we have
to a crime scene unit

11:47.710 --> 11:49.029
is Detective Hernandez.

11:49.040 --> 11:51.747
He has a fingerprinting kit from 1984.

11:51.750 --> 11:54.241
Find anything?
-The victim's prints were on one.

11:54.250 --> 11:56.912
The prints on the other were
too smudged to make any match,

11:56.920 --> 11:58.569
but I don't think
the killer drank this anyway.

11:58.580 --> 12:00.241
Why not?

12:00.250 --> 12:02.787
This drink is tamarind water. It's sweet.

12:02.790 --> 12:05.031
I could see the victim offer this
to a woman,

12:05.040 --> 12:06.667
but these are a time of festivities,

12:06.670 --> 12:08.911
and at night
most men would have a shot of tequila

12:08.920 --> 12:11.161
and some beers
and maybe some Cigarettes.

12:11.170 --> 12:12.785
This looks like two women to me.

12:13.250 --> 12:15.115
And you don't think
a woman could have done this?

12:15.120 --> 12:16.917
-Do you?
-It's highly unlikely.

12:17.330 --> 12:18.615
Give them to the FBI.

12:18.620 --> 12:21.168
At the very least it'll be able to tell us
the gender of the drinkers.

12:21.170 --> 12:23.070
-Where was she killed?
-This way.

12:41.500 --> 12:43.991
-What are you looking for

12:45.290 --> 12:47.531
Why'd the UnSub choose this victim?

12:47.920 --> 12:50.571
Why did she feel safe enough
to let the killer inside?

12:53.460 --> 12:55.246
This her son?

12:55.250 --> 12:56.911
That's Miguel.

13:00.040 --> 13:02.110
I'd say Lupe had a problem with him.

13:02.120 --> 13:05.533
She has family photographs
everywhere, but not Miguel.

13:05.540 --> 13:07.701
He's tucked away in her drawer.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.826
Okay, so the UnSub took
items of jewelery

13:11.830 --> 13:13.286
out of the daughter's bedroom.

13:13.290 --> 13:15.246
Do you think he did it before
or after he killed the mother?

13:15.250 --> 13:16.490
Well, I'd say after.

13:16.500 --> 13:19.572
The way the victim was stabbed means
this was a sexual homicide.

13:19.580 --> 13:21.207
When the killer's looking
for a sexual release,

13:21.210 --> 13:24.452
the items taken are _
usually an afterthought, trophies.

13:24.460 --> 13:26.610
But he left jewelery on the victim.
Why?

13:26.620 --> 13:31.068
It's a common sign of remorse.
A small amount of respect for the dead.

13:31.330 --> 13:33.457
Very small if you ask me.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.879
You are almost certainly looking
for a heterosexual male.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.160
Why do you say that?

13:41.170 --> 13:43.206
Well, the victim was found on the bed.

13:43.210 --> 13:47.032
Multiple stabs wounds
to the face, chest, and genital area.

13:47.040 --> 13:49.281
All indicators of sexual homicide.

13:49.290 --> 13:51.110
In cases of sexual homicide,

13:51.120 --> 13:54.374
the attacker targets objects
of his or her sexual attraction.

13:54.380 --> 13:56.245
Heterosexual men attack women.

13:56.250 --> 13:58.457
So, homosexual men attack men?

13:58.460 --> 14:00.826
Did the daughter have any ideas
about who might've done this?

14:01.250 --> 14:02.990
She didn't have any ideas
about anything.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.161
When she found out
that her brother was a suspect,

14:05.170 --> 14:06.706
she wanted to talk to him alone.

14:06.710 --> 14:09.372
I refused because I didn't want
them to get their stories straight.

14:09.380 --> 14:11.371
Then she stopped talking completely.

14:11.710 --> 14:14.110
So, what's she protecting?

14:14.120 --> 14:15.451
We're ready to talk to the suspect.

14:15.710 --> 14:18.281
Of course, but first there's someone
I would like you to meet.

14:22.710 --> 14:25.281
Maria Sanchez,
the district attorney general.

14:25.290 --> 14:26.746
Do not be afraid.

14:26.750 --> 14:28.456
-Agente Gideon.
-Hello.

14:28.460 --> 14:30.530
Agente Hotchner. It's an honor.

14:30.790 --> 14:33.873
Our papers are fascinated
with the idea of a serial killer,

14:33.880 --> 14:38.078
and when Navarro suggested that
I invite you in to dispel this nonsense,

14:38.080 --> 14:41.243
I immediately saw the wisdom.
But enough formalities.

14:41.250 --> 14:44.458
I will let you get down to business.
Excuse me.

14:48.250 --> 14:50.241
She's worse in Spanish.

14:53.790 --> 14:55.917
Neighbors heard a loud fight
the day of the murder

14:55.920 --> 14:59.037
between the victim, her son,
daughter and brother-in-law.

14:59.040 --> 15:00.371
One big, happy family.

15:00.380 --> 15:03.531
Well, the uncle had a solid alibi,
but we could not find the son.

15:03.540 --> 15:06.828
Then we got a tip he had hired a coyote
to take him over the border.

15:06.830 --> 15:09.116
We caught him before he crossed.

15:09.120 --> 15:10.917
That's Miguel's sister, Rosa.

15:10.920 --> 15:14.071
She's been here ever since she found
out that her brother was arrested.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.911
Seems like she thinks he's innocent.

15:15.920 --> 15:18.821
The dutiful sister. This way.

15:25.460 --> 15:29.282
Miguel, tell us about the fight you had
with your mother the other night.

15:30.380 --> 15:32.450
I didn't hurt my mother.

15:33.830 --> 15:36.617
Did it have anything to do
with you leaving?

15:36.620 --> 15:40.283
She didn't want me to go.
She was angry.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.820
It was more than that, Miguel.

15:47.830 --> 15:50.458
You had problems with your mother
for a long time.

15:53.750 --> 15:55.820
What is it you're hiding?

15:56.380 --> 15:58.666
What truth could be so terrible that

15:58.670 --> 16:02.162
you won't defend yourself
against killing your mother?

16:02.170 --> 16:05.822
What truth would have your mother
hiding your photographs in her drawer?

16:08.420 --> 16:10.456
When did you first know?

16:12.290 --> 16:13.666
Know what?

16:14.790 --> 16:16.872
That you're a homosexual.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.458
More to the point,
when did your mother find out?

16:32.710 --> 16:35.031
-How did he know?
-You told us.

16:35.040 --> 16:37.201
Machismo and family.
You knew he was gay.

16:37.210 --> 16:38.916
You're a better profiler
than Gideon's a lecturer.

16:38.920 --> 16:41.411
You also knew that a gay man
couldn't have committed this murder.

16:41.420 --> 16:43.069
That's why you asked
us about the sexuality

16:43.080 --> 16:44.240
of the killer at the crime scene.

16:44.250 --> 16:46.036
-You knew Miguel was innocent.
-You do not understand

16:46.040 --> 16:47.246
how things work here.

16:47.250 --> 16:49.741
If I had told the attorney general
that this man is a homosexual

16:49.750 --> 16:52.492
and that is why he must be innocent,
she would have laughed in my face.

16:52.500 --> 16:53.740
Why did you lie to us?

16:53.750 --> 16:55.377
I had to play along with the official line

16:55.380 --> 16:58.531
until I could trust that you would come
to the same conclusion that I did.

16:58.540 --> 17:01.498
So we're here to serve as pawns
in your political game?

17:01.790 --> 17:04.372
There is a very bad man killing women
in my district,

17:04.620 --> 17:06.372
and I have known this
for a very long time.

17:06.620 --> 17:10.078
And so far no one will _believe me
or help stop him.

17:10.080 --> 17:13.572
So, if I have to play politics
to protect the women of the city

17:14.580 --> 17:17.822
then that is a very small price to pay.
Don't you agree?

17:26.420 --> 17:28.206
Best way to bring the attorney general
on board

17:28.210 --> 17:30.030
is by providing a complete profile.

17:30.040 --> 17:32.782
-What do you need from me?
-We'll need the files on all the murders.

17:32.790 --> 17:34.371
Of course, but I must warn you.

17:34.380 --> 17:36.325
These reports were taken
by local police

17:36.330 --> 17:38.878
in the area _
who are not used to this type of killer.

17:38.880 --> 17:40.450
Most basic details are missing.

17:40.460 --> 17:41.779
We'll take a look at them.

17:41.790 --> 17:44.111
We also need to get the whole story
out of Miguel Trejo

17:44.120 --> 17:46.782
-and right now he's not talking.
-But why does that matter?

17:46.790 --> 17:48.496
Obviously, he's not a serial killer.

17:48.500 --> 17:51.207
Listen, obviously there's a great deal
of anger in the family,

17:51.210 --> 17:52.700
and before we give a profile,

17:52.710 --> 17:55.611
we need to rule out the fact _
that this might be a crime of pa55ion

17:55.620 --> 17:56.996
and not one of the serial killings.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.991
And why wouldn't Miguel talk
if he's innocent?

17:59.000 --> 18:01.616
It must have something to do
with the fact that he is a homosexual.

18:01.620 --> 18:04.282
He'd rather be straight in jail
than gay as a free man?

18:04.290 --> 18:05.951
I can protect him in here,

18:05.960 --> 18:08.417
but if he's taken to a prison
in Mexico City

18:08.420 --> 18:11.492
and the other inmates find out
that he is gay, he will be killed.

18:11.880 --> 18:13.950
That's the way things work here.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.450
So how do we get him to talk?

18:18.670 --> 18:21.116
Rosa, do you know the saying...

18:25.040 --> 18:28.919
We know there was a fight.
We need to know what it was about.

18:31.580 --> 18:34.071
Rosa, we know about your brother.

18:35.920 --> 18:38.161
If you don't help us,
he could go to prison

18:38.170 --> 18:39.569
and he could be killed there.

18:54.080 --> 18:57.914
Miguel has a friend, Roberto.

18:59.210 --> 19:03.704
_He was outside the house_
waiting for my brother, watching.

19:04.620 --> 19:06.827
He saw the fight with my mother.

19:06.830 --> 19:08.661
Did Miguel see him?

19:09.420 --> 19:11.206
I don't think so.

19:11.210 --> 19:13.110
Why didn't you tell us
about this before?

19:13.750 --> 19:16.617
Because it would mean
telling you that

19:17.040 --> 19:18.530
Miguel is...

19:24.290 --> 19:28.875
Like you said, if he goes to prison
and they know this about him,

19:28.880 --> 19:33.078
they will kill him and I cannot risk that.

19:33.080 --> 19:36.618
But you're talking about the man
who might have murdered your mother.

19:36.620 --> 19:39.453
You do not understand how bad it is.

19:39.460 --> 19:42.076
You do not understand the shame.

19:42.420 --> 19:45.241
You do not understand
what people Will do to us.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.072
I just lost my mother.
I cannot lose Miguel.

19:57.210 --> 19:58.746
Family is everything.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.956
She may have come clean
about that day,

20:02.960 --> 20:05.167
but I still think she's hiding something.

20:05.170 --> 20:07.286
The way she went on about shame,

20:07.290 --> 20:09.417
almost like
she was talking about herself.

20:09.420 --> 20:10.489
This is interesting.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.957
Before Miguel met Roberto,
Roberto had a wife.

20:13.830 --> 20:15.570
Well, if he was bisexual...

20:15.580 --> 20:18.322
It makes him capable
of sexual homicide of a woman.

20:18.330 --> 20:21.117
And if he blamed Miguel's mother
for denying their relationship,

20:21.120 --> 20:23.281
that would give him motive.

20:23.290 --> 20:24.496
We need to find Roberto.

20:28.920 --> 20:30.660
Roberto.

20:42.670 --> 20:46.322
You don't understand.
I would never hurt Miguel's mother.

20:46.330 --> 20:47.877
She was nice to me.

20:47.880 --> 20:50.201
She was trying to accept me.

20:50.210 --> 20:53.077
But Miguel's uncle made her feel bad
for that.

20:55.380 --> 20:56.870
They'll never accept us.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.745
Why'd you follow Miguel to his house,

20:58.750 --> 21:00.320
and why were you watching
Rosa and her mother?

21:00.330 --> 21:04.949
Miguel and I had a fight that day.
He was very upset. He got drunk.

21:04.960 --> 21:08.202
He was going to his family celebration.
I was afraid for him.

21:08.210 --> 21:10.246
I was afraid of the trouble
he might cause with his uncle.

21:10.250 --> 21:11.820
What'd you see?

21:12.250 --> 21:14.411
Miguel did not do it.
Is that what you want?

21:14.420 --> 21:17.036
For me to turn against him?
I won't. He did not do it.

21:17.040 --> 21:20.203
No, that's not what I asked.
You were outside the house watching.

21:20.210 --> 21:21.871
So, what did you see?

21:21.880 --> 21:25.281
I saw nothing. I saw children playing.
A woman.

21:25.540 --> 21:28.202
-What woman?
-I walked past her on the street.

21:28.210 --> 21:30.576
She had papers, a badge.

21:30.580 --> 21:32.992
I think _she was a social worker
gomg house to house.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.207
-What did she look like?
-I don't know. Heaw.

21:35.210 --> 21:37.280
Maybe 405 or 505.

21:40.880 --> 21:41.995
Okay.

21:45.500 --> 21:48.321
It is common for social workers
and nurses to come from the City,

21:48.330 --> 21:49.706
help out elderly women.

21:49.710 --> 21:52.668
Tell them about benefits they may have
is part of the reaching out programme.

21:52.670 --> 21:55.161
So it could have been the victim
who invited the social worker inside

21:55.170 --> 21:56.876
and maybe she was the one given
the tamarind water.

21:56.880 --> 21:59.496
She could be our best witness.

21:59.500 --> 22:02.992
I will check with local services.
What about Roberto?

22:03.500 --> 22:05.456
I don't think he did it.
-Why not?

22:05.460 --> 22:06.950
The way he talked about Miguel.

22:06.960 --> 22:08.496
He didn't point the finger
at his boyfriend

22:08.500 --> 22:11.116
-and I think a guilty man would have.
-See if he has an alibi.

22:11.120 --> 22:13.497
Run his prints against any found
at the scene.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.536
Right now though I feel confident

22:15.540 --> 22:18.111
we can rule out a family fight
as a motive for the murder.

22:18.120 --> 22:20.372
There's a call from the FBI.

22:21.500 --> 22:22.819
Yeah, Morgan.

22:22.830 --> 22:24.286
Dnde est, my lovelies?

22:27.790 --> 22:28.950
Okay, take it easy, Garcia.

22:28.960 --> 22:30.575
I think you just offended
somebody's mother.

22:30.580 --> 22:32.741
Shut up, you. I took French.
What can I say?

22:33.000 --> 22:34.740
Penelope, your last name is Garcia.

22:34.750 --> 22:36.286
Yeah, I know. It's my stepfather's name.

22:36.290 --> 22:37.575
Now do you want my genius or not?

22:37.580 --> 22:40.162
-Yes. Please, get on with it.
-Okay!

22:40.170 --> 22:43.037
So, I rushed your cups full of mucus
through all the regular channels

22:43.040 --> 22:46.112
at lightning speed and survey says
one female drinker and one male.

22:47.330 --> 22:48.820
Thanks, doll.

22:49.120 --> 22:52.669
It's strange, on this occasion
a man taking that drink.

22:52.670 --> 22:55.491
Unless the victim thought
he was a woman.

22:55.500 --> 22:57.707
The woman Roberto described,
a social worker.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.530
That's a common ruse
for old-lady killers.

22:59.540 --> 23:03.374
What if she is really a he
in women's clothing?

23:03.380 --> 23:06.201
-A heavy woman.
-He comes to the door, knocks on it.

23:06.210 --> 23:10.112
And the victim feels comfortable
because she thinks it's a woman.

23:10.120 --> 23:12.611
It would explain
why no witnesses have come forward.

23:12.620 --> 23:15.248
No one expects
the killer to be a woman.

23:15.250 --> 23:17.662
-Not in this country.
-Or ours.

23:17.920 --> 23:20.821
-We need to tell the locals. _
-And give them the rest of the profile.

23:20.830 --> 23:23.037
We have_reason to believe
that the killer may be a man

23:23.040 --> 23:26.419
who wears women's clothing as a ruse
to get into his victim's homes.

23:26.420 --> 23:28.285
Once inside, the killer stabs his victims

23:28.290 --> 23:29.996
and then abuses them sexually
with the knife.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.615
But he wasn't always a killer.

23:31.620 --> 23:33.702
He gradually escalated
from sex crimes.

23:33.710 --> 23:36.201
These may have started out
as Peeping Tom incidents,

23:36.210 --> 23:37.666
eventually leading to rape.

23:37.670 --> 23:39.911
And then at some point
he couldn't rape any more.

23:39.920 --> 23:41.114
So, he began killing women

23:41.120 --> 23:43.111
who represented authority figures
in his life he hated.

23:43.120 --> 23:44.997
Typically a mother or grandmother.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.490
Women that he blamed
for his impotence.

23:46.500 --> 23:48.070
How would we have targeted
these women?

23:48.080 --> 23:49.741
We found no connection
between them.

23:49.750 --> 23:50.990
We don't know yet.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.661
But based
on the number of times he's killed

23:52.670 --> 23:55.116
and his skill at gaining the trust
of his victims,

23:55.120 --> 23:56.747
we can assume
that he plans his murders

23:56.750 --> 23:59.116
and that he's been committing
sex crimes for many years.

23:59.120 --> 24:01.782
We think he's somewhere
between the ages of 35 and 50.

24:03.040 --> 24:05.247
You need to talk to
all known sex offenders

24:05.250 --> 24:07.878
and compare them to this profile.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.825
You should also re-interview
all your Witnesses

24:09.830 --> 24:13.539
and see if anyone saw a man who
might have been dressed as a woman.

24:22.830 --> 24:24.786
We have another body.

24:24.790 --> 24:26.826
Isabel Santiago, 67.

24:27.330 --> 24:30.458
No sign of forced entry.
Stabbed in the chest and genitals.

24:31.040 --> 24:33.201
Abrasions on her neck.

24:34.670 --> 24:36.991
Beads, from a necklace.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.376
Obviously ripped off her neck.

24:38.380 --> 24:40.280
Yeah, but jewelery taken
from the body.

24:40.290 --> 24:42.030
That's a first we've seen from this guy.

24:42.040 --> 24:44.417
So, why was this one different?

24:51.790 --> 24:53.075
Over the past two years,

24:53.080 --> 24:56.117
we've had an average of one killing
every nine weeks.

24:56.120 --> 24:58.168
Now two in three days.

24:58.170 --> 25:01.958
That's a pretty extreme escalation.
He'll kill again soon.

25:04.170 --> 25:06.070
Who's that over there?

25:06.580 --> 25:08.161
That's the daughter of the victim.

25:08.170 --> 25:10.616
Maybe she can tell us something
about the necklace.

25:21.620 --> 25:23.167
Yes.

25:23.170 --> 25:26.287
Your mother was wearing a necklace.
It was taken from her.

25:26.290 --> 25:29.919
Do you know if it had
any special significance to her?

25:31.500 --> 25:34.037
She gave it to me for my birthday.

25:36.250 --> 25:39.071
She never bought jewelery for herself.

25:39.830 --> 25:42.879
She asked if she could wear it
during the holiday.

25:42.880 --> 25:45.030
So this necklace was yours?

25:45.500 --> 25:49.163
It was my favorite.
I wore it almost every day.

25:50.830 --> 25:53.207
Navarro says there's some sort of
disturbance at the police station.

25:53.210 --> 25:56.247
-We're going to go check it out.
-All right.

26:03.420 --> 26:05.911
What is going on here, Borquez

26:05.920 --> 26:08.070
What did they do?

26:08.080 --> 26:09.820
They are following the orders
of the FBI.

26:09.830 --> 26:12.492
-Bringing in the sex criminals.
-What did you tell them?

26:13.080 --> 26:15.537
We put out there the possibility
that he dresses like a woman.

26:15.540 --> 26:17.747
We told them to look into people
convicted of sex crimes.

26:17.750 --> 26:19.411
We didn't mean this.

26:26.290 --> 26:28.030
What is going on, Victor, huh?

26:28.040 --> 26:30.747
These men were supposed
to put the serial killer rumors to rest,

26:30.750 --> 26:32.911
and now they are making us
look like a joke.

26:32.920 --> 26:34.376
What do you want
people to think of us?

26:34.380 --> 26:36.826
-It was a misunderstanding.
-And it won't happen again.

26:36.830 --> 26:40.948
It was your idea to bring them here,
and obviously it was a waste of time.

26:41.790 --> 26:43.701
Please, go home.

27:02.120 --> 27:05.749
These police are not stupid men.
They're frustrated.

27:05.750 --> 27:08.992
They read articles in newspapers
saying that they're ineffective

27:09.000 --> 27:10.661
and they want to prove
that they are not.

27:10.670 --> 27:12.376
They will do this
any way they know how.

27:12.380 --> 27:14.917
We told them that the suspect was
probably a man dressed as a woman.

27:14.920 --> 27:17.787
We didn't say to round up
all the transvestites and bring them in.

27:17.790 --> 27:20.327
Why

27:20.620 --> 27:22.872
No. No, that's not what we're saying.

27:22.880 --> 27:24.074
Men dressing like women,

27:24.080 --> 27:26.321
it's a manifestation
of sexual preference.

27:26.330 --> 27:27.786
It is a lifestyle.

27:27.790 --> 27:30.167
It does not imply
a psychology of violent behavior.

27:30.170 --> 27:31.740
We're talking about the killer's past.

27:31.750 --> 27:32.990
That's why we were asking for people

27:33.000 --> 27:34.240
who have been accused of sex crimes.

27:34.250 --> 27:36.206
-Are the police looking into this

27:36.210 --> 27:38.110
Most rapes here are not even reported,

27:38.120 --> 27:40.577
and the rapists are often people
who have power over them.

27:40.580 --> 27:44.414
Sometimes family.
Sometimes even law enforcement.

27:44.420 --> 27:48.743
I have interviewed many, many women
and they do not want to talk.

27:48.750 --> 27:51.992
We can help you.
We can teach you interview strategies.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.321
I specialized in sex crimes
and I speak Spanish.

27:54.330 --> 27:57.379
-How do we even get to these women?
-We hold a press conference.

27:57.380 --> 27:58.916
Let everyone know
what we're looking for.

27:58.920 --> 28:01.411
What about the attorney general?
She wants us to leave.

28:01.420 --> 28:02.956
Do not worry about her.

28:02.960 --> 28:06.703
I convinced her to bring you down here,
I can convince her to let you stay.

28:08.670 --> 28:11.377
We will have that press conference.

28:14.920 --> 28:17.206
Be forceful, but respectful.

28:17.210 --> 28:19.781
Tell them, "Please,
if you have any information at all,

28:19.790 --> 28:21.872
"we urge you to come forward.

28:21.880 --> 28:24.417
"The one thing we absolutely do know
about this kind of criminal

28:24.420 --> 28:27.071
"is that he does not stop offending
until he is stopped."

28:27.080 --> 28:28.377
The reporters will ask,

28:28.380 --> 28:30.746
"Why look for a rapist
when we're trying to catch a killer?"

28:30.750 --> 28:32.456
You don't need to mention the killer.

28:32.460 --> 28:35.782
Just tell them that you care
about the women in this town

28:35.790 --> 28:38.782
and that you are committed to catching
the men who hurt them.

28:38.790 --> 28:40.667
Why are we looking for a rapist?

28:40.670 --> 28:42.706
_ Because we know _ _
this man commits sexual homICIde,

28:42.710 --> 28:44.780
we can also assume_
that he was once a rapist.

28:44.790 --> 28:48.282
It's a lot easier to track a rapist than
a killer because you have witnesses.

28:48.290 --> 28:51.282
But you also have the chance
to discover something else,

28:51.290 --> 28:52.951
the reason he began killing.

28:52.960 --> 28:54.109
Which is the stressor.

28:54.120 --> 28:55.530
As far as we can tell,

28:55.540 --> 28:58.498
the first killing
was about two years ago.

28:59.620 --> 29:01.918
What happened to the suspect
during that time?

29:01.920 --> 29:05.321
A typical stressor,
loss of a job, loss of love.

29:05.330 --> 29:06.706
He may have been released
from prison.

29:06.710 --> 29:08.416
Whatever it was,
it made him feel impotent.

29:08.420 --> 29:10.376
It made him feel frustrated
and very angry.

29:10.380 --> 29:11.745
And that's when he started killing.

29:11.750 --> 29:12.910
You should be talking to victims

29:12.920 --> 29:15.411
who reported rapes just before
that first murder two years ago.

29:15.420 --> 29:17.240
Hopefully, the press conference
will help bring

29:17.250 --> 29:18.535
some of these women forward,

29:18.540 --> 29:21.828
but we also need to head out_ and talk
to some of these people directly.

29:21.830 --> 29:23.536
You should use
all the female police you have.

29:23.540 --> 29:25.417
It will help put
potential victims at ease.

29:25.420 --> 29:27.285
Well, we don't have any, boss.

29:27.620 --> 29:28.996
You do now.

29:36.790 --> 29:40.374
I've been talking to so many women
I'm forgetting how to speak English.

29:40.380 --> 29:42.416
Well, you know, you look Latina.

29:42.420 --> 29:44.536
Well, there's a good reason for that.
My mother's Cuban.

29:45.710 --> 29:46.870
We may have something.

29:46.880 --> 29:49.747
A woman called the police station after
she saw the report on the television.

29:49.750 --> 29:50.876
Yeah?

29:50.880 --> 29:52.324
She says she has information
on the rapist.

29:54.960 --> 30:01.820
Excuse me. I was told you want to talk
to me about the rapist were looking for.

30:07.250 --> 30:08.820
Do you care?

30:08.830 --> 30:11.822
Most of the time nobody around here
cares what happens to women.

30:11.830 --> 30:16.324
Nobody does anything about it.
That's why nobody talks to the police.

30:20.580 --> 30:25.199
What can the police do if when a crime
is committed no one comes forward?

30:28.960 --> 30:31.531
The man who attacked me
is a stupid dog.

30:31.830 --> 30:35.459
He's a coward. He came up from
behind and he started to rape me,

30:36.210 --> 30:38.371
but then I turned around
and I started hitting him.

30:38.380 --> 30:40.496
I scratched him. I made him bleed,

30:41.080 --> 30:43.571
and that's when I saw
he was wearing a dress.

30:44.750 --> 30:47.878
A dress. I couldn't believe it.

30:49.210 --> 30:52.998
I laughed in his face.
I called him a pathetic woman.

30:54.540 --> 30:56.326
He was so scared.

30:57.210 --> 30:58.996
He ran away like a little boy.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.821
-When did this happen, Milagros?
-Two years ago.

31:02.210 --> 31:05.247
If you weren't afraid of this man,
why didn't you report him?

31:05.250 --> 31:07.787
I told you. What good would it do?

31:11.000 --> 31:13.707
Well, she claimed
it happened two years ago in August.

31:13.710 --> 31:15.871
The first murder happened
in September.

31:15.880 --> 31:17.950
So she could have been
the last one who was raped

31:17.960 --> 31:20.076
before whatever stressor made him kill.

31:20.080 --> 31:21.786
Or she could have been the stressor.

31:21.790 --> 31:23.610
You say
this woman laughed in his face,

31:23.620 --> 31:25.451
hit him, called him a woman.

31:25.460 --> 31:27.325
That could have been enough
to make him impotent.

31:27.330 --> 31:30.072
He tries to rape again and
all he can hear is this woman laughing.

31:30.080 --> 31:31.820
Maybe he thought
he could rape older women.

31:31.830 --> 31:34.708
Thought they'd be easier.
Wouldn't put up a fight, so he tries.

31:34.710 --> 31:37.076
But he can't. He gets frustrated,
he kills her,

31:37.080 --> 31:39.492
and then he finds the release
that he was looking for.

31:39.500 --> 31:41.456
So he kills again.
-Excuse me.

31:41.460 --> 31:43.610
-The other victims are here.
-Send them in.

31:48.080 --> 31:49.616
You wanted us to come forward?

31:49.620 --> 31:52.327
Here are six more women
who were raped by this man.

31:52.330 --> 31:54.457
Now prove to us
it will finally do some good.

32:37.540 --> 32:40.498
How did you find all these women,
Milagros?

32:40.500 --> 32:44.994
Seor Navarro, we may not talk to you,
but we talk to each other.

32:45.250 --> 32:48.663
Well, now you must tell us your stories.
Every detail.

32:48.670 --> 32:52.071
Because the cycle does not end
until this man is stopped.

33:13.580 --> 33:15.161
They all have the same story.

33:15.170 --> 33:18.242
He goes up to them in the street,
puts a knife against their back,

33:18.250 --> 33:20.457
blindfolds them,
and takes them out to the desert.

33:20.460 --> 33:23.281
He also kissed their neck
while raping them.

33:23.290 --> 33:26.782
And then when he's finished he asks,
"How did I do?"

33:26.790 --> 33:29.827
-Classic power-reassurance behavior.
-What does that mean?

33:29.830 --> 33:31.912
Power-reassurance rapists
lack confidence.

33:31.920 --> 33:34.878
They can't develop
normal relationships with women.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.745
Passive and non-athletic.

33:36.750 --> 33:39.241
He most likely fantasizes
that the victims are his girlfriends

33:39.250 --> 33:42.378
and of the different types of rapists,
he's the most likely to be dissuaded

33:42.380 --> 33:45.326
if the victim screams
or struggles in any way.

33:45.330 --> 33:48.709
Is that it

33:48.710 --> 33:50.917
-There's actually one more...
-Excuse me.

33:50.920 --> 33:53.491
I've been going over the forms filled out
by the women.

33:53.500 --> 33:55.491
Four of them work in the same factory.

33:55.500 --> 33:58.116
He most likely lives or works
near the victim.

34:09.170 --> 34:11.115
I have owned this plant for nine years

34:11.120 --> 34:14.419
and I do not allow the men I hire
to abuse the women.

34:14.420 --> 34:17.071
I'm sorry, but I do not believe
this man works here.

34:17.080 --> 34:20.208
Miss, the man we're looking for
wouldn't be openly abusive.

34:20.210 --> 34:21.700
He might just like
following women around

34:21.710 --> 34:23.996
or peeking into women's bathrooms.
That sort of thing.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.286
He would be shy with women,
especially you.

34:26.290 --> 34:28.918
You intimidate him. He probably
couldn't look you in the eye.

34:28.920 --> 34:31.036
The only way I could be a woman
and run this plant

34:31.040 --> 34:33.952
is to make sure
every man feels that way.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.615
I'm sorry.

34:37.750 --> 34:39.741
How many men work here?

34:41.290 --> 34:42.609
Over 50.

34:42.960 --> 34:44.871
We need to look through
all your employee records.

34:46.580 --> 34:48.821
So far I've found
more than three dozen men

34:48.830 --> 34:51.993
who fit the target profile
between the ages of 35 and 50.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.615
This owner wasn't kidding.

34:53.620 --> 34:55.611
Almost all of these guys had a citation

34:55.620 --> 34:57.702
for lewd behavior
against the women here.

34:57.710 --> 35:00.998
They'd be warned once and then
they'd be fired if it happened again.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.036
-I wouldn't mess with her.
-Afraid of a woman, Hotch?

35:03.040 --> 35:04.200
Shoot, I'd be afraid of her.

35:04.210 --> 35:07.828
Only one of these men showed up
in police records with a sex crime.

35:07.830 --> 35:10.242
He beat up a prostitute
when she refused to get rough.

35:10.250 --> 35:11.740
Not our guy. He'd be scared.

35:11.750 --> 35:13.957
He wouldn't have the confidence
to stand up to a refusal.

35:13.960 --> 35:15.166
Okay, but this is crazy.

35:15.170 --> 35:17.240
There's way too many men here
to interview and not enough time.

35:17.250 --> 35:18.615
Okay, we need to narrow down
the profile.

35:18.620 --> 35:20.451
-What would make our guy stand out?
-From what you tell me,

35:20.460 --> 35:21.825
he completely lacks machismo.

35:21.830 --> 35:24.037
He has none of the conﬁdence
of a typical man in Mxico.

35:24.040 --> 35:25.610
Even with a knife in his hand.

35:25.620 --> 35:27.576
What was it he said to the women
after raping them?

35:27.580 --> 35:28.820
"How did I do?"

35:28.830 --> 35:31.788
Any guy with confidence doesn't need
to ask if he's doing a good job.

35:31.790 --> 35:34.281
He assumes it, in bed and at work.

35:34.290 --> 35:37.669
In bed and at work. Come on.

35:42.920 --> 35:45.536
This guy
desperately wants to impress you.

35:45.540 --> 35:48.327
No matter how small the job,
he always wants your approval.

35:48.330 --> 35:50.070
He may constantly ask, "How did I do?"

35:55.120 --> 35:58.749
Pablo Vargas. He's been on vacation
since four days ago.

35:58.750 --> 36:00.115
The day of Lupe Trejo's killing.

36:00.120 --> 36:01.326
What does he do here?

36:01.330 --> 36:05.039
He's the floor manager of sector 16,
women's plus-sizes.

36:05.040 --> 36:06.280
We're going to need his address and

36:06.290 --> 36:07.826
any other information you can give us.

36:07.830 --> 36:09.240
Thank you.

36:25.620 --> 36:27.201
There's a TV on. Someone's inside.

36:31.830 --> 36:32.910
Go.

37:05.710 --> 37:07.075
Hotch!

37:09.210 --> 37:10.746
A little late.

37:11.670 --> 37:14.070
-Souvenirs for his mother?
-Anna's necklace.

37:17.500 --> 37:19.286
Elle, look at this.

37:20.710 --> 37:22.416
His rape victims.

37:52.460 --> 37:55.782
We have a name,
but how do you find him?

37:55.790 --> 37:58.111
We always ask, why this victim

37:58.120 --> 37:59.747
Serial killers plan their killings,

37:59.750 --> 38:03.868
and if we can figure out how he targets
his victims we can get ahead of him.

38:03.880 --> 38:05.950
Borquez, what is this?

38:06.620 --> 38:08.827
I charted all the names
of the rape victims who came in

38:08.830 --> 38:10.457
like they instructed us.

38:10.460 --> 38:12.200
That name, Torres.

38:12.920 --> 38:14.490
There was a murder victim
with that name.

38:14.500 --> 38:16.741
Well, sir, there are hundreds of
Torreses in this town.

38:16.750 --> 38:18.877
Let me see the statements.

38:29.540 --> 38:31.917
-What is it?
-It's maiden names.

38:31.920 --> 38:34.707
The murder victims
and the rape victims.

38:48.330 --> 38:49.911
The names are the same.

38:51.880 --> 38:54.451
He's killing the mothers of the women
he raped.

38:54.460 --> 38:56.576
He's doing it in the same order.

38:56.580 --> 38:59.458
The daughters of the last two
murder victims, Trejo and Santiago,

38:59.460 --> 39:00.700
never came forward.

39:00.710 --> 39:03.326
If we can assume they were raped,

39:03.330 --> 39:06.322
then according to the board
the next rape victim in line was...

39:06.330 --> 39:08.241
Milagros Villanueva.

39:08.250 --> 39:10.377
_ -His last.
-He's gomg to kill her mother.

39:35.040 --> 39:36.325
Morgan!

39:37.420 --> 39:38.990
What's up

39:39.000 --> 39:40.160
Yeah.

39:43.460 --> 39:45.416
-You good?
-Behind you.

39:49.960 --> 39:51.370
It's clear!

40:04.040 --> 40:05.496
Elle.

40:05.500 --> 40:06.956
Over here!

40:12.710 --> 40:14.575
-You got me?
-Got you.

40:38.120 --> 40:42.329
He pretended to be a woman.
Now he doesn't have to pretend.

41:15.330 --> 41:18.242
-Will they be charged Why?

41:18.830 --> 41:20.957
They were only defending their homes.

41:28.960 --> 41:30.996
Good job, Agent Gideon.

41:39.880 --> 41:41.745
What did you say in there?

41:41.750 --> 41:44.071
It's just an old Mexican proverb.

41:44.080 --> 41:47.038
Please. Do not hesitate to call
next time you're in town.

41:47.040 --> 41:48.416
Thank you.

41:50.120 --> 41:52.327
I'm thinking of starting
a BAU in my district.

41:52.670 --> 41:53.876
Takes a lot of training.

41:55.380 --> 41:56.745
Thank you.

42:07.920 --> 42:09.569
Mexican proverb.

42:10.080 --> 42:14.574
"The house does not rest upon
the ground but upon a woman."
