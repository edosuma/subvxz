WEBVTT

00:06.005 --> 00:07.549
COYOTE AND ROAD RUNNER

00:15.724 --> 00:18.309
Am I the first person
you've snuck into Seattle?

00:19.436 --> 00:21.688
Don't worry.
I've done this a bunch of times.

00:21.980 --> 00:23.189
It's gonna be all right.

00:29.654 --> 00:30.488
Fire!

00:45.879 --> 00:47.505
CP403
DISASTER RELIEF

00:49.382 --> 00:50.383
CHECKPOINT

00:50.633 --> 00:52.469
-I'm freaking out. I can't--
-Hey, look at me.

00:53.386 --> 00:55.305
I've done this a million times.

00:55.805 --> 00:56.848
You got this.

01:05.815 --> 01:09.152
So now, Harrison Ford loves
millennials and haunted houses.

01:09.235 --> 01:10.403
Hold on, what's this?

01:11.362 --> 01:14.699
"Don E and DJ Deep Cuts present
'Scratch-Up'

01:14.866 --> 01:18.161
Human vs. Zombie Night every Tuesday
night at The Scratching Post.

01:18.495 --> 01:19.996
Can't we all just get along?"

01:20.914 --> 01:21.956
This can't be real.

01:22.165 --> 01:24.375
Very real. Very tone-deaf.

01:24.667 --> 01:26.211
Very much in their wheelhouse.

01:26.920 --> 01:30.215
Exploiting the fragile state
of human-zombie relations

01:30.298 --> 01:32.050
for a topical dance theme?

01:32.634 --> 01:34.636
Blaine must be really
hard-up for business.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.805
Or, you know, he's Blaine.

01:37.555 --> 01:38.723
CRIME SCENE DO NOT CROSS

01:38.807 --> 01:39.682
Excuse me.

01:43.686 --> 01:45.355
The victim was shot through the heart.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.483
Point blank range. Execution style.

01:48.858 --> 01:50.485
The bullet is lodged in the wall, there.

01:51.277 --> 01:52.320
One in the chamber.

01:52.403 --> 01:53.363
Right through the chamber.

01:54.531 --> 01:56.491
Heart chamber. Medical humor.

01:56.616 --> 01:58.618
The best jokes are the ones
you have to explain.

01:58.993 --> 02:00.245
Sick burn.

02:00.495 --> 02:03.373
Ballistics should be able to match
the bullets to a firearm

02:03.456 --> 02:05.625
and narrow down the murder weapon,
but that's all we got.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.752
I'm gonna need your A-game
on this one, Liv,

02:07.836 --> 02:11.464
even though you don't have
much to go on. Literally.

02:12.006 --> 02:13.800
Most of the victim's brain is missing.

02:13.883 --> 02:14.843
What do you mean "missing"?

02:14.926 --> 02:19.139
I mean, someone tried to steal the whole
kit 'n' caboodle, but got interrupted.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.766
So all you have to work with is...

02:25.311 --> 02:26.187
the "kit."

02:29.023 --> 02:32.068
That does not look good
for human-zombie relations.

02:34.946 --> 02:37.031
THE BEGINNING

02:37.282 --> 02:39.284
THE INFECTION

02:39.367 --> 02:41.327
THE TRANSFORMATION

02:41.411 --> 02:43.705
THE EX-FIANCE

02:43.872 --> 02:44.956
THE BEST FRIEND

02:45.039 --> 02:47.292
THE PROPHET

02:47.750 --> 02:49.085
THE ALLY

02:49.168 --> 02:50.628
THE PARTNER

02:50.712 --> 02:52.297
...BUT I'M A ZOMBIE

02:54.132 --> 02:57.343
IZOMBIE

02:57.427 --> 02:59.012
IF I ONLY HAD A BRAIN Clive's theory holds,

03:01.848 --> 03:04.934
whoever did this was acting fast
and loose with one hell of a bone saw.

03:05.184 --> 03:06.728
The murder was so clean.

03:06.853 --> 03:08.354
Why was the brain

03:08.855 --> 03:10.440
Could've been different culprits.

03:10.565 --> 03:12.275
One guy's whack is another's snack. Ready to have your minds blown?

03:17.071 --> 03:18.448
Sorry, scratch that.

03:19.365 --> 03:21.951
-Come on, mate.
-Too soon, bro.

03:22.035 --> 03:22.911
Yeah.

03:23.328 --> 03:25.204
I got an ID on our murder victim.

03:26.664 --> 03:30.460
Annie Wallace. 25 years old,
from Johnson County, Kansas,

03:31.169 --> 03:34.005
where she was living until three days ago.

03:34.297 --> 03:36.090
Her parents reported her
missing yesterday.

03:36.216 --> 03:39.302
And from a preliminary investigation
into her recent Internet searches,

03:39.385 --> 03:43.932
as well as a transfer of $25,000
into an untraceable account.

03:44.098 --> 03:47.477
It's looking like Annie hired
a Coyote to smuggle her into Seattle.

03:47.560 --> 03:50.647
Why? She was perfectly healthy.
No need to be zombified.

03:50.730 --> 03:53.107
Something must've brought her here
that was worth dying for.

03:53.399 --> 03:55.068
Something, or someone...

03:55.568 --> 03:58.988
There's a Seattle number that Annie
called and texted non-stop.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.491
A guy named Allan Fox.

04:02.158 --> 04:03.618
Not sure what their relationship was,

04:03.785 --> 04:07.288
but transcripts are on their way in,
along with Mr. Fox himself.

04:07.872 --> 04:11.626
So you might wanna make yourself
a little snack.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.754
It will be just a little snack,

04:14.879 --> 04:17.924
thank you very much. Because this
has to last me a week.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.510
Don't you always say
you wish you were on a diet?

04:20.593 --> 04:21.427
I am kidding!

04:21.636 --> 04:23.179
I am mocking people who say that.

04:23.388 --> 04:24.806
That's how anti-diet I am.

04:24.889 --> 04:27.267
I have bits about my hatred
of that lifestyle choice!

04:27.433 --> 04:30.186
All right. You are hangry
and you haven't even started.

05:04.220 --> 05:06.764
<i>Wow. Allan Fox.</i>

05:10.727 --> 05:12.979
<i>Did my heart love till now?</i>

05:13.062 --> 05:14.731
<i>-Forswear it, sight...</i>

05:14.856 --> 05:17.984
<i>For I never saw true beauty, till this...</i>

05:18.151 --> 05:19.944
Liv! Liv!

05:21.446 --> 05:22.322
Was that a vision?

05:23.031 --> 05:24.490
Yes, he is.

05:25.116 --> 05:26.159
Is this about Annie?

05:26.242 --> 05:27.744
She tried to cross into Seattle,
didn't she?

05:27.827 --> 05:29.203
Why don't you take a seat, Allan.

05:29.412 --> 05:30.288
She did.

05:31.080 --> 05:33.750
I warned her. I said,
"Annie, don't do it! Don't..."

05:33.958 --> 05:35.626
How do you know Ms. Wallace?

05:36.711 --> 05:38.880
We met online about a month ago.

05:39.422 --> 05:42.300
Well, 29 days, 18 hours and 30...

05:43.301 --> 05:45.845
six seconds ago,
but who's counting, right?

05:47.513 --> 05:49.891
And how did you two meet exactly?

05:49.974 --> 05:53.227
We met in a <i>Bridget Jones' Diary</i>
chat room.

05:53.811 --> 05:54.937
Go on.

05:55.688 --> 05:56.564
Oh, boy.

05:56.647 --> 06:01.069
There's a lot of rom-com obsessed
women on those sites,

06:01.194 --> 06:02.570
but Annie was different.

06:03.071 --> 06:06.741
You know, she... I mean, sure,
she was a hopeless romantic like me.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.701
A hopeless romantic, huh?

06:08.785 --> 06:11.245
But we were both after
for the real thing. True love.

06:11.370 --> 06:13.539
Can't sleep, keep you up at night,

06:13.664 --> 06:15.166
inconvenient, all-consuming,

06:15.374 --> 06:18.419
lose your job and who cares anyway
because who needs another telemarketer.

06:18.503 --> 06:19.712
Yeah, I think we get it.

06:19.879 --> 06:20.797
Love.

06:21.339 --> 06:24.467
A lot of women who love Bridget Jones

06:24.717 --> 06:26.427
say they want a Mark Darcy,

06:26.511 --> 06:28.179
but are really hung up
on a Daniel Cleaver.

06:28.429 --> 06:32.600
Or worse, a Daniel Cleaver
who's posing as a Mark Darcy.

06:32.892 --> 06:35.311
-The worst.
Yeah.

06:35.728 --> 06:37.814
But I'm a real Mark Darcy.

06:38.147 --> 06:39.774
-And Annie sees that.
-Saw that.

06:41.150 --> 06:44.529
Oh, my goodness. I guess we're just
finishing each other's sentences.

06:47.865 --> 06:49.951
Looking at these texts,

06:50.034 --> 06:53.746
you've been planning your wedding,
your honeymoon, your kids' names,

06:54.038 --> 06:56.040
even though you've only known
each other for a month

06:56.124 --> 06:57.959
and never met face-to-face.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.627
You know how crazy that sounds?

06:59.710 --> 07:01.129
Sounds like true love.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.296
It is.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.507
We're soulmates.

07:06.634 --> 07:09.929
Then why did you tell her
not to come to Seattle?

07:10.930 --> 07:12.348
"I mean it. Don't come here, Annie."

07:13.182 --> 07:14.517
"Don't come to Seattle."

07:15.810 --> 07:18.771
"Seriously, coming to Seattle
would be a terrible idea."

07:18.855 --> 07:20.440
She talked about sneaking
into Seattle all the time,

07:20.523 --> 07:21.858
thought it would be romantic.

07:22.150 --> 07:24.610
But she doesn't live here,
she doesn't know how dangerous it is.

07:24.735 --> 07:26.946
I tried to dissuade her all the time

07:27.029 --> 07:29.115
without getting into the gritty details,

07:29.198 --> 07:32.493
but it sounds like it didn't work?

07:34.245 --> 07:36.414
So, where is she now?
Is she back in Kansas?

07:38.499 --> 07:40.251
Is she in a holding cell?

07:40.751 --> 07:41.794
Can I see her?

07:43.629 --> 07:45.756
Is she... Is she in trouble?

07:45.840 --> 07:48.342
She's not in trouble, Allan.

07:50.011 --> 07:50.845
She's dead.

07:52.722 --> 07:54.515
Dead? No.

07:57.768 --> 07:58.686
No.

08:01.355 --> 08:04.567
No!

08:08.779 --> 08:10.406
Why don't we take five?

08:17.622 --> 08:19.373
CRAZY STUPID LIV

08:20.124 --> 08:21.167
It's just not fair.

08:22.376 --> 08:24.545
Tomorrow is our month anniversary.

08:24.629 --> 08:25.713
I understand.

08:26.380 --> 08:29.217
Most of my boyfriends
have died in terrible ways too.

08:30.134 --> 08:31.052
But who knows,

08:31.719 --> 08:33.179
maybe you'll find someone new.

08:34.138 --> 08:35.306
Sooner than you think.

08:36.474 --> 08:39.685
Maybe they're right in front of your face,
and you don't even know it.

08:46.108 --> 08:47.568
Sorry, there was a bug.

08:48.402 --> 08:49.654
Hey, I have an idea.

08:49.946 --> 08:52.281
Why don't you meet me tonight
at The Scratching Post?

08:53.074 --> 08:54.534
I just want to be alone.

08:55.785 --> 08:56.953
Watch<i> The Notebook.</i>

08:57.912 --> 08:59.830
"If you're a bird, I'm a bird."

09:00.748 --> 09:01.666
What?

09:02.250 --> 09:03.292
Sorry, the bug was back.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.670
It was a spider and it was pregnant, so...

09:05.753 --> 09:07.046
Oh, my God! Did you get it?

09:07.255 --> 09:08.923
Yeah, yeah. No. I saw it hobble off.

09:09.006 --> 09:10.383
-I maimed it, we're good.

09:10.466 --> 09:11.759
Over there.

09:12.969 --> 09:16.430
Allan. Allan. I know
you're going through a lot right now,

09:16.764 --> 09:18.641
but human-zombie night
at The Scratching Post

09:18.724 --> 09:20.101
is only once a week.

09:20.184 --> 09:24.522
And I think Annie would want you to find
your next Bridget Jones, don't you?

09:25.022 --> 09:26.774
I think she'd want me to wait a day.

09:27.984 --> 09:28.985
Allan.

09:29.527 --> 09:32.321
You're free to go for now,
but don't travel far.

09:32.697 --> 09:33.656
Not that you can.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.034
So, see you tonight?

09:45.084 --> 09:46.294
-Oh.

09:47.169 --> 09:48.671
Am I fatter than Annie?

09:50.131 --> 09:52.383
Liv, I know you're on a flighty
romantic brain,

09:52.466 --> 09:53.718
but I need you to focus.

09:55.177 --> 09:57.305
You cannot see Allan outside of this case.

09:57.388 --> 09:58.556
I think he may be our guy.

09:58.639 --> 10:00.808
But I'm 100% sure he's innocent.

10:00.891 --> 10:01.726
Based on what?

10:01.809 --> 10:04.729
The fact that he may be
my future soulmate!

10:04.812 --> 10:07.064
He may be a future inmate, Liv!

10:07.273 --> 10:09.066
You've known him for 45 minutes!

10:11.235 --> 10:13.362
I'm not going down
this rabbit hole with you.

10:14.655 --> 10:16.365
We need to find Annie's coyote.

10:16.574 --> 10:18.492
He was one of the last people
to see her alive,

10:18.576 --> 10:20.036
so he may have seen her killer, too.

10:20.119 --> 10:23.664
Problem is, coyotes aren't generally
that easy to find.

10:24.123 --> 10:26.083
Love always finds a way.

10:29.128 --> 10:31.380
Actually, I may know someone.

10:32.340 --> 10:33.591
I'll try to get a hold of her.

10:40.514 --> 10:41.849
-Sir.
-Not a good time, Major.

10:41.932 --> 10:43.017
There's been a scratching.

10:47.271 --> 10:48.314
An accidental one.

10:49.315 --> 10:50.691
I've been trying to get to you for days.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.401
Your office won't give me ten seconds.

10:54.070 --> 10:56.947
If Alice can resist your charms,
she's better than I thought she was.

10:57.531 --> 10:59.533
-A lawsuit.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.494
Our cadet, Jordan Gladwell,

11:01.577 --> 11:03.954
accidentally scratched
an aggressive human during a call.

11:04.163 --> 11:06.082
Now, his family is suing her
for wrongful death.

11:06.290 --> 11:07.291
She's panicking.

11:07.958 --> 11:09.835
Plus, Fillmore-Graves
is listed as a defendant.

11:11.754 --> 11:12.713
Good luck with that.

11:13.422 --> 11:15.424
I'm more concerned
with the extra mouth I have to feed.

11:15.966 --> 11:17.051
There's also a video.

11:18.719 --> 11:20.596
She scratched him in rage mode.

11:21.847 --> 11:22.765
In uniform.

11:25.017 --> 11:25.976
Has it been leaked?

11:27.186 --> 11:28.062
Not yet.

11:28.896 --> 11:29.814
Keep it that way.

11:30.231 --> 11:31.107
Yes, sir.

11:35.236 --> 11:36.195
Thank you, Alice.

11:40.449 --> 11:41.283
Morning.

11:43.035 --> 11:44.495
I found this on my windshield an hour ago.

11:44.578 --> 11:45.454
THE DARWIN PROJECT
WE CAN HELP YOU! Has anyone heard of it?

11:49.542 --> 11:52.586
Apparently, "The Darwin Project"
is offering

11:53.087 --> 11:57.174
unimaginable wealth to zombies
willing to try to escape Seattle

11:57.258 --> 11:59.385
and volunteer their bodies for research.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.637
They could be a pharmaceutical company.

12:02.805 --> 12:04.890
They could be another
terrorist organization.

12:05.850 --> 12:08.561
They could be a rag-tag team
of indie filmmakers.

12:08.686 --> 12:09.603
I don't know.

12:09.979 --> 12:10.980
I don't care.

12:12.982 --> 12:14.442
I just want them snuffed out.

12:17.653 --> 12:19.613
Sir. All due respect,

12:19.738 --> 12:22.032
zombies leaving Seattle
is the U.S. Army's problem.

12:22.408 --> 12:25.453
We need to be laser focused
on our very massive brain shortage.

12:25.619 --> 12:26.454
It's serious.

12:26.537 --> 12:29.623
We've got undocumented humans
being scratched by coyotes.

12:29.748 --> 12:32.751
Fewer humans than we expected
are donating their brains,

12:33.127 --> 12:34.837
and those brains that do come our way,

12:35.296 --> 12:36.797
too many are falling off the trucks.

12:37.882 --> 12:38.841
How long do we have?

12:40.509 --> 12:41.469
Four to six months.

12:44.138 --> 12:46.849
That's when we'll start seeing
mass starvation,

12:48.058 --> 12:49.018
zombies turning.

12:51.312 --> 12:52.313
Look,

12:52.521 --> 12:55.065
no one's gonna blame you
for The Darwin Project,

12:55.191 --> 12:57.234
but you're supposed to feed these people.

12:58.235 --> 12:59.528
And if you fail in that,

12:59.612 --> 13:03.115
the 10,000 zombies we made
will come for your head.

13:12.500 --> 13:13.792
Chase Graves is here.

13:14.293 --> 13:15.294
Is that normal?

13:17.171 --> 13:18.506
Should I bring him a hooker?

13:19.673 --> 13:20.674
I'm good with water.

13:21.675 --> 13:22.510
Thank you.

13:38.442 --> 13:39.443
Little dark in here.

13:40.194 --> 13:41.111
It's a basement.

13:41.445 --> 13:43.113
I'm referring to the ambiance.

13:44.323 --> 13:47.326
The look, the touch, the smell.

13:47.535 --> 13:49.411
-Decay.

13:50.371 --> 13:52.039
-Rot.
-We're dead, Chase.

13:52.164 --> 13:53.374
Maybe that's your upper lip.

13:56.919 --> 13:58.629
Look, I don't have anything for you
at the moment.

13:58.796 --> 14:00.130
Well, I have something for you.

14:00.214 --> 14:01.173
A decorator?

14:03.008 --> 14:05.261
Have you heard of a coyote
who calls himself "Renegade"?

14:06.845 --> 14:07.763
No.

14:07.846 --> 14:10.516
Renegade's operation turns
more humans into zombies

14:10.641 --> 14:12.768
than all other coyote outfits combined.

14:12.893 --> 14:15.229
The city's brain rations
are suffering as a result,

14:15.604 --> 14:17.898
which means that shutting down
Renegade is a top priority.

14:18.315 --> 14:19.358
So here's the deal.

14:22.236 --> 14:23.487
You bring me Renegade,

14:24.321 --> 14:26.490
and you can go back to running
your establishments in peace.

14:29.660 --> 14:32.705
And I'd never have to deal
with you ever again?

14:33.831 --> 14:35.332
Consider it your final favor.

14:37.084 --> 14:38.502
Consider it done.

14:42.673 --> 14:44.592
TO THE LADLE FROM THE GRAVE

14:51.265 --> 14:52.725
Get ready to get happy, my friend,

14:52.808 --> 14:55.853
because I have got some
real beauties for you today.

14:55.936 --> 14:59.273
I have medulla, frontal, occipital,
and cerebellum.

14:59.356 --> 15:03.193
I have brain stem
and one last basal ganglia.

15:05.112 --> 15:06.071
No temporal lobe?

15:06.655 --> 15:08.365
Just sold out of temporal.

15:08.532 --> 15:10.284
Sold out

15:10.367 --> 15:12.870
I got a big order this week
from Le Dome, okay?

15:12.953 --> 15:15.289
Hey, you want to put in
an advance order, be my guest.

15:15.497 --> 15:16.874
Gimme the profiles.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.209
And a free sample or two

15:19.293 --> 15:21.337
before I take my business elsewhere.

15:21.503 --> 15:26.008
Romeros does not take
Le Dome's sloppy seconds.

15:33.515 --> 15:37.019
Ooh. Hit me with some of that mime brain.

15:37.102 --> 15:37.937
That

15:39.188 --> 15:43.400
is mime medulla with just a splash
of cortisol from the adrenal gland.

15:58.707 --> 16:01.835
I'm just kidding, it hasn't kicked in yet.

16:02.002 --> 16:05.047
But I do love mimes.
That's good blue brain material.

16:05.130 --> 16:06.006
What else is good?

16:08.133 --> 16:09.218
Catch of the day.

16:15.432 --> 16:16.433
I like that.

16:17.142 --> 16:19.728
That makes me feel all warm and fuzzy.
Which one is that?

16:19.895 --> 16:21.897
Love-struck Midwestern belle...

16:21.981 --> 16:22.856
MIKE STABLER
ANNIE WALLACE

16:22.940 --> 16:24.483
with a heart of gold.

16:25.109 --> 16:26.902
No relation to the dead girl
of the same name

16:26.986 --> 16:28.278
that everyone's freaking out about.

16:30.197 --> 16:31.240
I'll take the whole thing.

16:31.824 --> 16:32.950
Or whatever's left.

16:33.367 --> 16:36.203
My supplier said it was a bit
of a rush job.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.332
-Yeah, that's it.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.626
Next time, don't take the business
with the competition.

16:43.544 --> 16:45.838
So sensitive. What are you, my girlfriend?

16:47.089 --> 16:49.466
Okay, okay. You know what?

16:49.675 --> 16:52.219
I'm gonna throw in a little
architect brain, on the house.

16:52.344 --> 16:54.638
Pun intended, very creative, very fun.

16:55.180 --> 16:56.015
You see?

16:56.890 --> 16:58.350
That's customer service.

17:02.855 --> 17:03.897
Dalton. Got a minute?

17:07.484 --> 17:09.653
You deal directly with the coyotes, right?

17:09.987 --> 17:12.448
You buy from them,
and you sell to whoever you sell to.

17:12.781 --> 17:15.159
Blaine, you know I always
come to you guys first,

17:15.242 --> 17:17.202
but Le Dome cleaned me out this week.

17:17.286 --> 17:19.580
Somebody had a sweet 16
at Fillmore-Graves and--

17:20.372 --> 17:22.291
You ever deal with a coyote
named Renegade?

17:22.958 --> 17:24.168
-I've heard of her.

17:24.334 --> 17:25.335
Yeah, that's the word.

17:25.461 --> 17:27.546
But, you know, her clients always
make it to Seattle alive,

17:27.629 --> 17:29.631
so our paths have no cause for crossing.

17:29.715 --> 17:32.468
You know anybody who deals with her
directly or knows her at all?

17:32.634 --> 17:35.554
No, she's not really in our circles.

17:36.263 --> 17:37.139
But, actually--

17:37.848 --> 17:39.099
Yeah, you know,

17:39.224 --> 17:42.686
when I was at Le Dome earlier,
I overheard this new zombie

17:43.103 --> 17:45.939
at the bar. He was flapping his lips
about how he jumped the wall

17:46.065 --> 17:48.400
when he was at death's door,
and how some old broad

17:48.525 --> 17:50.402
scratched him and saved his life.

17:50.486 --> 17:51.904
Okay. Bring me that guy,

17:52.196 --> 17:54.448
and you can add two zeroes
to whatever you just charged us.

17:54.656 --> 17:56.533
Hey, sure thing, boss.

17:58.577 --> 17:59.495
And Dalton?

18:00.913 --> 18:03.999
I don't care if the Sultan
of Malaysia's having a bar mitzvah,

18:04.083 --> 18:05.751
you never, and I mean never,

18:06.794 --> 18:08.170
go to Le Dome before us.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.387
Thank God you're here!

18:17.471 --> 18:18.639
What's going on

18:18.764 --> 18:21.058
Liv is insisting I go with her
to human-zombie night

18:21.141 --> 18:22.351
at The Scratching Post.

18:23.685 --> 18:25.813
She said she met her "soulmate" today

18:25.979 --> 18:29.650
and he'll be there, but it sounds like
he's a murder suspect

18:29.733 --> 18:31.151
she talked to for an hour?

18:31.985 --> 18:33.153
What brain is she on?

18:33.278 --> 18:35.489
Hopeless romantic
with a penchant for rom-coms.

18:35.572 --> 18:38.033
I caught her practicing
meet cutes today with a corpse.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.618
You gotta wing-man me then.

18:40.327 --> 18:42.579
I can't go alone to Blaine's club.

18:43.330 --> 18:47.000
There's not enough alcohol in the world.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.920
I am flattered.

18:50.629 --> 18:54.883
Really, it's an honor
to just be nominated.

18:55.300 --> 18:58.637
But I nearly killed myself rushing over,

18:58.720 --> 19:02.474
because when I get a text that says,
"Emergency! Come over!"

19:02.808 --> 19:05.227
I expect a degree of
life-or-death stakes,

19:05.394 --> 19:07.396
not a night out at "da club."

19:07.813 --> 19:09.481
So, hard pass.

19:09.565 --> 19:10.440
No, no.

19:11.525 --> 19:13.485
-You have to come.
-You can't make me!

19:14.111 --> 19:14.987
Ravi.

19:15.946 --> 19:16.989
You're coming!

19:17.197 --> 19:19.283
Ravi, are you coming with us?

19:19.700 --> 19:21.785
This is gonna be so much fun!

19:22.536 --> 19:23.912
You're not wearing that, are you?

19:25.205 --> 19:26.206
Yeah, that's just it.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.918
I haven't a thing to wear.

19:30.252 --> 19:33.922
So, very sadly, looks like I'm gonna
have to sit this one out.

19:34.006 --> 19:34.882
Unless,

19:35.716 --> 19:38.135
we do a make-over.

19:38.510 --> 19:39.344
What?

19:39.469 --> 19:41.889
Make-over, make-over, make-over!

19:59.489 --> 20:01.700
-No, no, no, no, no.
-All right.

20:04.578 --> 20:06.246
-Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
-Okay.

20:12.961 --> 20:13.795
I love it.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.473
Oh, yes!

20:34.399 --> 20:35.525
Ooh.

20:36.944 --> 20:39.571
Yes. Yes. Yes.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.493
What is going on here?

20:45.702 --> 20:47.329
Dude. My shirt!

20:47.537 --> 20:49.206
Sorry, mate. Fashion casualty.

20:49.873 --> 20:51.917
We're going to human-zombie night
at The Scratching Post.

20:52.334 --> 20:53.168
Why? Major.

20:55.629 --> 20:57.923
There is no easy way to tell you this,

20:58.674 --> 20:59.967
but I've met someone.

21:00.717 --> 21:03.428
And I think he may be the love of my life.

21:05.222 --> 21:06.431
She's crazy.

21:11.061 --> 21:12.479
I've had a very long day,

21:12.562 --> 21:15.274
unsuccessfully tracking down
an incriminating video.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.150
Plus we're in a fight,

21:17.567 --> 21:20.696
so I'm gonna go make myself a burrito.

21:25.742 --> 21:27.911
He is so brave.

21:32.874 --> 21:34.293
START A LOVE BRAIN, LOVE BRAIN

21:37.379 --> 21:38.839
I don't think he's here yet.

21:45.345 --> 21:47.347
Well, I need a drink. Shall we?

21:48.098 --> 21:52.894
Yeah, actually, I think I might take
this make-over out for a quick spin first.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.354
-So...
-You have to save me!

21:54.563 --> 21:55.522
I'll see you in a few!

21:57.441 --> 21:59.359
Scratch-Up forever!

22:04.197 --> 22:05.699
-No.

22:05.866 --> 22:06.742
Good.

22:06.825 --> 22:09.828
Shot of tequila.
Then turn up this song. It kicks ass.

22:09.911 --> 22:11.788
-And...
-I'll have what she's having.

22:12.456 --> 22:16.877
I can't wait to see Allan
and look deeply, sensually, into his eyes.

22:17.002 --> 22:18.128
Wanna open a tab?

22:18.670 --> 22:19.921
Blaine lets us drink here for free.

22:20.047 --> 22:20.881
Uh...

22:22.632 --> 22:24.259
I can feel it, Peyton.

22:24.760 --> 22:27.429
The twirling forces of fate and destiny,

22:27.637 --> 22:28.805
burning inside me,

22:29.306 --> 22:31.600
-tickling my loins...
-Like bad sushi.

22:32.059 --> 22:34.352
We should go on a double date next week.

22:34.811 --> 22:36.271
Does Derek like picnics?

22:40.150 --> 22:41.026
Keep 'em coming.

22:44.237 --> 22:46.114
What do you think is more romantic?

22:46.323 --> 22:48.742
A spring wedding, or a fall wedding?

22:48.992 --> 22:51.745
-Of course, you'd be my maid of honor.
Save me.

22:52.037 --> 22:53.080
Sorry.
-I'm thinking...

22:53.497 --> 22:55.332
nectar for the dresses,

22:55.749 --> 22:57.709
that would look good
with your skin tone, yeah?

22:58.460 --> 23:00.378
Liv, it's getting pretty late.

23:01.588 --> 23:02.714
Fashionably late.

23:03.298 --> 23:04.633
Classic Allan.

23:05.008 --> 23:07.427
Do you think there's anywhere
to honeymoon in Seattle,

23:07.552 --> 23:10.138
that doesn't feel like,
"Help, I'm trapped here forever"?

23:22.234 --> 23:23.693
You've met him once.

23:24.569 --> 23:25.737
He's human.

23:26.530 --> 23:28.907
And he probably murdered
his last girlfriend.

23:29.032 --> 23:30.450
Nobody's perfect!

23:31.326 --> 23:33.036
-Liv.
-Peyton.

23:33.203 --> 23:35.664
Human-zombie relationships can work.

23:35.747 --> 23:38.542
Look at Blive and Cozzio, you know?

23:39.292 --> 23:40.627
I'd rather read a book.

23:44.131 --> 23:45.882
THE SCRATCHING POST

23:45.966 --> 23:48.468
You know, I thought you and Ravi
had true love.

23:53.098 --> 23:54.015
No.

24:00.689 --> 24:02.399
Definitely not.

24:08.238 --> 24:09.114
Let's go dance.

24:09.197 --> 24:12.033
I'm afraid if I dance,
I'll miss Allan coming in.

24:12.325 --> 24:14.244
Or I will vomit.

24:21.334 --> 24:22.252
Okay.

24:33.638 --> 24:35.599
<i>I thought Allan was my soulmate.</i>

24:35.724 --> 24:37.350
<i>But maybe Peyton was right. </i>

24:37.642 --> 24:41.771
<i>Maybe Allan is just a murder suspect</i>
<i>who's just not that into me.</i>

24:42.522 --> 24:43.356
Hey!

24:44.983 --> 24:46.526
-Let's go.

24:46.735 --> 24:47.819
No! You haven't danced!

24:47.903 --> 24:49.487
We just requested your favorite song!

24:49.654 --> 24:51.573
I don't know. I just feel stupid.

24:52.073 --> 24:54.075
Like I'm the biggest loser in here.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.786
You are not the biggest loser in here!

24:58.246 --> 25:00.248
Ravi, show her.

25:12.177 --> 25:13.053
See?

25:13.637 --> 25:16.306
This robot is the biggest loser here!

25:16.556 --> 25:17.641
That was a robot?

25:20.977 --> 25:21.853
They're playing it!

25:22.103 --> 25:23.313
-Let's dance!
-Come on!

26:07.524 --> 26:09.192
-I'm sorry.

26:10.568 --> 26:11.861
<i>And just like that,</i>

26:11.945 --> 26:14.489
<i>I was shot with cupid's arrow.</i>

26:14.823 --> 26:15.782
<i>Again!</i>

26:16.908 --> 26:20.537
<i>Wow, this new person...</i>

26:21.579 --> 26:23.707
<i>Did my heart love till now?</i>

26:24.457 --> 26:25.959
<i>Forswear it, sight...</i>

26:26.543 --> 26:28.753
<i>For I never saw true beauty,</i>

26:28.837 --> 26:29.796
<i>-till...</i>
-So!

26:30.171 --> 26:31.589
I see you're part of the blue crew.

26:32.716 --> 26:33.800
We're twinsies.

26:35.552 --> 26:36.428
I'm Liv.

26:36.803 --> 26:38.305
-Tim.
<i>-Tim...</i>

26:38.972 --> 26:40.056
You're really beautiful.

26:41.224 --> 26:42.392
<i>Could this be it? </i>

26:43.268 --> 26:44.936
<i>My one true love?</i>

26:45.270 --> 26:46.396
<i>My soulmate?</i>

26:57.157 --> 26:58.074
Where'd Liv go?

27:00.368 --> 27:01.369
Oh, there she...

27:01.786 --> 27:03.538
Oh, my God!

27:05.790 --> 27:09.461
It's like watching R2-D2 stick
his extension arm into the Grand Canyon.

27:10.754 --> 27:12.672
-Sick robot callback!
-Oh!

27:22.349 --> 27:23.683
MANIC PIXIE SCREAM GIRL

27:27.979 --> 27:29.147
Liv

27:30.231 --> 27:32.150
Tim wrote his number on my hand last night

27:32.233 --> 27:34.027
and it smeared off and now it's gone!

27:34.319 --> 27:36.154
Tim! Tim!

27:39.657 --> 27:41.868
Liv. I'm sure you can find
another way to contact him.

27:42.285 --> 27:44.454
How? I don't know his last name.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.456
I don't know where he works.

27:47.165 --> 27:50.335
All I know is he has these piercing
emerald eyes

27:50.668 --> 27:53.421
and the smooth, velvety lips
of a sex angel.

27:54.672 --> 27:56.633
That's not exactly something
you can Google, is it?

27:57.133 --> 27:59.010
Not if you don't wanna see
stuff you can't unsee.

27:59.886 --> 28:01.721
Thus, with a kiss, I die.

28:02.680 --> 28:03.598
Again!

28:04.432 --> 28:06.101
Aren't you forgetting a certain

28:07.352 --> 28:09.229
four letter word that starts with "F"?

28:10.105 --> 28:10.939
Funk

28:14.526 --> 28:16.319
-I give up.
-Fate.

28:17.570 --> 28:19.948
If it's true love,
you'll meet again, right?

28:20.740 --> 28:23.827
Even if it means we go back
to human-zombie night next week.

28:24.369 --> 28:27.497
I actually had a surprisingly fun time.

28:28.665 --> 28:30.458
And I like supporting you
in your romantic endeavors

28:30.542 --> 28:33.211
when you don't meet them
through Clive's murder investigations.

28:34.129 --> 28:35.088
Oh, no.

28:35.505 --> 28:36.673
-I almost forgot.

28:36.923 --> 28:39.551
I saw Bozzio last night
at The Scratching Post.

28:39.759 --> 28:41.386
She was cheating on Clive.

28:41.553 --> 28:42.679
That's terrible.

28:43.221 --> 28:44.931
-Yeah.

28:45.181 --> 28:46.433
You think he'd wanna know?

28:46.516 --> 28:50.186
Clive won't eat soup dumplings
because, "They have too many secrets."

28:50.562 --> 28:52.647
So yeah, I do.

28:57.652 --> 29:00.655
<i>Clive would want to know </i>
<i>that Bozzio's being unfaithful. </i>

29:02.073 --> 29:05.660
<i>So why does the thought of telling him </i>
<i>leave my stomach in knots?</i>

29:06.661 --> 29:08.496
<i>Because it'll break his heart.</i>

29:13.251 --> 29:15.378
Liv. Glad you're here.
I wanna show you something.

29:15.587 --> 29:16.463
Hi, Liv.

29:17.172 --> 29:19.090
Dale. Cute name, Dale.

29:19.924 --> 29:22.677
Always reminds of that mentally
impaired cartoon chipmunk.

29:22.844 --> 29:25.138
You know, the one who's always going
on adventures with Chip,

29:25.221 --> 29:26.973
but was really just the dead weight
holding him back.

29:29.684 --> 29:31.227
Sorry, child of the '80s.

29:31.686 --> 29:32.979
Way after your time.

29:33.605 --> 29:34.481
Okay.

29:36.024 --> 29:39.402
Fun talk. I will see you later?

29:39.986 --> 29:40.820
Yeah.

29:46.826 --> 29:47.827
You okay?

29:48.536 --> 29:50.455
You seem tense.

29:50.580 --> 29:52.457
I'm fine. Let's just focus on work.

29:52.749 --> 29:53.833
I thought we were.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.795
Remember that woman who I hoped
would lead us to Annie's coyote?

29:57.128 --> 29:59.339
Well, I left messages for her,

29:59.464 --> 30:01.508
I even stopped by her place,
and she's not answering.

30:01.591 --> 30:02.592
So that's a no-go.

30:02.801 --> 30:05.178
Well, I, on the other hand,
found out something interesting.

30:05.553 --> 30:08.723
Looks like Allan forgot to mention
that he's a pretty avid gun collector.

30:08.973 --> 30:11.851
He even moonlights as a shooting
instructor on the weekends.

30:12.185 --> 30:13.061
Who's Allan?

30:15.188 --> 30:17.232
The guy you were in love with yesterday.

30:20.109 --> 30:20.944
This guy.

30:21.277 --> 30:22.320
Oh, right.

30:23.196 --> 30:25.365
Daniel Cleaver posing as a Mark Darcy.

30:25.782 --> 30:26.783
The worst.

30:27.450 --> 30:28.785
Glad to hear you moved on.

30:32.956 --> 30:35.625
Ballistics should have a report
for us by tomorrow morning

30:35.750 --> 30:37.919
with weapon matches from the bullets.

30:38.461 --> 30:42.257
I'm anxious to see if they match
any one of Allan's sundry guns.

30:42.966 --> 30:43.800
Who's that?

30:44.759 --> 30:45.844
Oh, new uni.

30:46.177 --> 30:47.512
Michelle, I think. Why?

30:47.595 --> 30:48.596
She's pretty.

30:50.098 --> 30:50.932
Okay.

30:51.140 --> 30:52.100
Don't you think she's pretty?

30:53.518 --> 30:55.144
-Okay.
-Let's go introduce ourselves.

30:55.395 --> 30:56.980
-It's a nice thing to do.

30:58.147 --> 30:59.524
She's in the middle of training.

30:59.691 --> 31:01.109
It'll take five seconds. Come on.

31:05.363 --> 31:06.489
I bet she's smart too.

31:06.948 --> 31:07.991
Kind. Confident.

31:08.074 --> 31:10.410
The kind of girl who binges
<i>Game of Thrones</i> and loves the Knicks.

31:10.493 --> 31:12.871
Liv, why are you selling me this woman

31:12.954 --> 31:14.247
like you're trying to set me up with her?

31:14.330 --> 31:17.333
I'm not. I just think it's possible

31:17.417 --> 31:19.294
that you would have a lot in common.

31:19.419 --> 31:21.129
And I'm sure she could use a friend
in the department.

31:22.338 --> 31:24.215
She also looks like she'd make
a great mother. Hi, sorry to interrupt.

31:26.968 --> 31:29.929
I'm Olivia Moore
and this is Detective Clive Babineaux.

31:30.054 --> 31:30.930
Hi.

31:31.055 --> 31:33.391
We just saw that you were new and wanted
to introduce ourselves.

31:33.600 --> 31:34.726
I work in the morgue,

31:34.851 --> 31:36.603
and Clive is originally from Brooklyn.

31:36.686 --> 31:38.813
He has an older sister,
who he's very close with,

31:38.938 --> 31:41.190
and he owns a condo downtown.

31:41.274 --> 31:43.276
-Liv.
-He's also very modest.

31:43.359 --> 31:47.071
Much as I appreciate the warm
welcome that I never received,

31:47.447 --> 31:48.698
we're a little busy at the moment.

31:49.198 --> 31:50.450
Liv. Come on.

31:50.658 --> 31:51.701
Cop block.

31:52.660 --> 31:54.329
-I said,

31:55.121 --> 31:57.165
"How's your wife, Cavanaugh?"

32:00.251 --> 32:01.252
Fine?

32:05.590 --> 32:07.675
Don't worry. You got this.

32:10.345 --> 32:11.554
You got this.

32:14.682 --> 32:16.267
We call that a "brain vision." Chapter 14, section eight.

32:18.811 --> 32:20.396
Cool. It's nice meeting you.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.315
And your angry friend.

32:24.734 --> 32:26.194
Liv, it better be a good one,

32:26.277 --> 32:28.488
because I'm starting to forget
why I put up with this.

32:28.571 --> 32:30.239
I saw Annie's coyote.

32:32.700 --> 32:35.161
And just like that, she lives another day.

32:36.663 --> 32:38.539
I just think Clive's in denial.

32:38.915 --> 32:42.043
I mean, I love the guy,
but he has a lot of pride, you know?

32:43.670 --> 32:44.545
Hair color.

32:44.712 --> 32:47.131
Brown. Medium length.
Pretty straightforward.

32:47.215 --> 32:49.342
Unlike Bozzio, that two-timing wench.

32:49.425 --> 32:53.638
Does this coyote have facial hair?
Beard Whiskers?

32:57.642 --> 32:59.394
-No.

33:00.353 --> 33:04.399
Also, Clive did not seem
totally opposed to the idea of Michelle.

33:04.649 --> 33:05.984
He kind of pretended like he was,

33:06.067 --> 33:08.069
but I know when he thinks someone's cute.

33:08.236 --> 33:10.613
Any freckles
Defining characteristics?

33:10.697 --> 33:11.572
A ton!

33:11.781 --> 33:14.784
Clive's a catch! That's part of what makes
this whole thing so upsetting.

33:14.909 --> 33:16.327
He deserves to be happy.

33:16.494 --> 33:18.121
Liv, we're so close.

33:18.663 --> 33:21.416
Stay with me.
Any facial marks, or blemishes.

33:22.709 --> 33:25.670
He had a freckle on his left cheek bone,
I think that's it.

33:28.423 --> 33:30.675
I honestly wasn't sure if I was gonna
make it home on this one.

33:31.050 --> 33:32.719
This was my odyssey.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.887
But... Here it is.

33:34.971 --> 33:37.140
That's him. He's perfect.

33:37.557 --> 33:39.392
You're into this human

33:40.143 --> 33:41.394
No, this is Tim.

33:41.477 --> 33:44.480
My new boyfriend,
and also probably the love of my life.

33:45.189 --> 33:47.567
I thought the love of my life
was this other guy, Allan,

33:47.650 --> 33:50.486
but it turns out he was probably
Annie's murderer.

33:50.611 --> 33:51.863
Talk about sliding doors.

33:56.492 --> 33:59.579
But yeah, we should also knock out
that coyote sketch while we're here.

34:05.084 --> 34:06.002
Kiss me.

34:06.502 --> 34:08.212
Kiss me as if it were the last time!

34:10.173 --> 34:13.092
<i>Fate. It could bring Tim and me together, </i>

34:13.634 --> 34:15.511
<i>or tear us apart. </i>

34:16.304 --> 34:18.306
<i>I wish I could just skip to the ending.</i>

34:20.850 --> 34:22.810
UNKNOWN NUMBER
DECLINE - ACCEPT

34:25.104 --> 34:25.980
Hello?

34:35.198 --> 34:36.824
I heard you were looking for me.

34:43.247 --> 34:44.874
WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS

34:45.750 --> 34:47.877
Rex said you needed my help
on a murder case.

34:48.628 --> 34:51.464
We're looking for the coyote
who brought our victim into Seattle.

34:52.799 --> 34:54.383
We're hoping he can ID the murderer.

34:57.220 --> 34:58.096
Bruce.

34:58.221 --> 35:01.015
He runs with a really bad crew.

35:01.432 --> 35:02.558
Bad how?

35:03.643 --> 35:06.479
They lure desperate people
over the wall to kill them.

35:07.230 --> 35:10.316
Steal their brains, their organs,
their phones.

35:10.525 --> 35:11.734
Empty their bank accounts.

35:12.235 --> 35:15.363
Sometimes they'll ransom them
to their loved ones at home.

35:15.905 --> 35:18.407
But they never send them back.

35:18.950 --> 35:21.410
You think this guy Bruce
was trying to do all that?

35:21.494 --> 35:23.121
That's hard to say.

35:24.330 --> 35:26.582
What was her name? The victim.

35:28.793 --> 35:29.669
Annie.

35:31.712 --> 35:33.381
I wish she had found me instead.

35:38.469 --> 35:39.679
How do I find Bruce?

35:41.305 --> 35:42.557
Get lucky.

35:43.224 --> 35:45.601
His people operate on the deep web.

35:45.935 --> 35:47.395
Almost impossible to trace.

35:48.563 --> 35:49.689
So what do we do?

35:51.774 --> 35:52.650
We cry.

35:53.109 --> 35:54.026
We mourn.

35:54.694 --> 35:56.320
And we never forget the Annies.

35:57.280 --> 35:58.114
Ever.

36:27.018 --> 36:28.895
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

36:29.145 --> 36:30.438
Am I a man of my word?

36:30.563 --> 36:31.689
A gentleman and a scholar.

36:32.523 --> 36:34.609
This is Anthony. And Anthony, this is...

36:34.692 --> 36:37.111
The blue brain guy! Can't wait!

36:37.195 --> 36:38.321
What a place!

36:38.571 --> 36:40.656
Last time I was in one of these joints
was 20 years ago

36:40.740 --> 36:42.491
when I cheated on my wife with a stripper.

36:42.658 --> 36:43.868
Went by the name Roxy.

36:43.951 --> 36:44.785
Gave me gonorrhea.

36:44.869 --> 36:46.871
But hey, what doesn't kill ya, huh?

36:47.205 --> 36:48.873
I love a man with a positive attitude.

36:50.249 --> 36:51.292
Smells nice, what is that?

36:51.417 --> 36:54.420
I'm getting cotton blossom
with a hint of carrot cake.

36:55.213 --> 36:57.089
Red pomegranate. Please.

37:02.678 --> 37:04.388
Dalton just went to get some blue brains.

37:04.972 --> 37:05.932
He'll be back soon.

37:07.099 --> 37:07.975
So...

37:08.809 --> 37:11.145
Dalton tells me you're new
to the zombie lifestyle.

37:11.270 --> 37:13.814
That's right. Suck it, Parkinson's!

37:16.234 --> 37:17.944
And you were scratched
by the famous Renegade.

37:19.904 --> 37:21.864
-It is.

37:22.490 --> 37:23.407
It is.

37:24.325 --> 37:26.911
But I'm more interested
in what they don't call her.

37:27.912 --> 37:28.996
Her real name,

37:29.497 --> 37:31.958
current base of operations, you know,

37:32.541 --> 37:33.584
that sort of thing.

37:33.709 --> 37:34.710
Huh.

37:35.503 --> 37:36.337
Uh...

37:37.546 --> 37:39.382
I swore not to reveal anything about her,

37:39.465 --> 37:41.634
and, well, I owe that woman my life.

37:42.301 --> 37:45.763
I heard you were blabbing
your whole life story all over town.

37:46.514 --> 37:47.807
That you're a man with no secrets.

37:48.099 --> 37:50.309
Stuff about Renegade,
that's not my secret to tell.

37:50.393 --> 37:51.269
I'm no snitch.

37:51.769 --> 37:53.896
You wouldn't have to be a snitch, Anthony.

37:55.064 --> 37:56.565
But I think it's in your best interest,

37:57.525 --> 37:59.235
but nobody's forcing you.

38:06.742 --> 38:07.618
What's that?

38:09.036 --> 38:10.204
So glad you asked.

38:15.334 --> 38:17.044
These are cures for the zombie disease.

38:18.462 --> 38:19.338
Sixteen of them.

38:20.840 --> 38:21.799
Bull-pucky.

38:23.050 --> 38:24.093
Even if they are,

38:25.011 --> 38:26.971
I'm not selling out Renegade for a cure.

38:28.139 --> 38:30.057
Let me spell out your limited options.

38:31.392 --> 38:32.601
You can stay a zombie

38:33.227 --> 38:34.812
and we can do this the easy way.

38:35.438 --> 38:36.314
Or...

38:37.648 --> 38:39.025
We can turn you back into a human

38:40.526 --> 38:41.610
and do it the hard way.

38:42.653 --> 38:43.654
So, what'll it be?

38:44.280 --> 38:46.449
The VC didn't get jack from me in 'Nam.

38:47.325 --> 38:48.951
You won't be getting anything, either.

39:21.359 --> 39:22.902
Ballistics report came in.

39:22.985 --> 39:24.612
None of Allan's guns were a match.

39:25.279 --> 39:27.531
Looks like that coyote, Bruce, is our guy.

39:27.615 --> 39:30.159
He was chasing her out of some
building with an incinerator.

39:30.284 --> 39:31.285
But that could be anywhere.
