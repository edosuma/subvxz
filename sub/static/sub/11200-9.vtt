-Sir.
-Colonel.

00:05.706 --> 00:08.675
-I need you to read this.
-Good morning to you, too, Colonel.

00:08.775 --> 00:11.437
-Sorry, sir. How are you?
-What is it?

00:11.778 --> 00:12.972
It's a report from the Tok'ra.

00:13.080 --> 00:16.174
They've discovered a gravitational
disturbance with their long-range sensors.

00:16.283 --> 00:17.910
Another Ori incursion?

00:18.018 --> 00:20.145
Well, it could simply be
a yet undiscovered black hole,

00:20.253 --> 00:22.483
but the Tok'ra won't have
a ship in range for some time.

00:22.589 --> 00:24.989
I've located a planet with a stargate
close to the disturbance.

00:25.092 --> 00:28.391
-lf you'll permit me to take a...
-Go. SG-5 should be available.

00:29.329 --> 00:30.819
Thank you, sir.

00:34.367 --> 00:35.994
(SIREN WAILING)

00:37.504 --> 00:39.699
HARRlMAN: Unscheduled
offworld activation.

00:39.806 --> 00:42.536
-Walter?
-I'm receiving an iris code, sir.

00:43.143 --> 00:46.169
-It's Colonel Carter.
-That was fast. Open the iris.

00:46.446 --> 00:47.640
Yes, sir.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.712
(RUMBLING)

00:52.719 --> 00:55.449
Colonel, tell me you've got good news.

00:56.356 --> 00:59.154
Actually, sir,
I think there was a little glitch.

00:59.259 --> 01:01.386
We were on the wrong planet, sir.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.552
-Was the intel wrong?
-No, sir.

01:03.663 --> 01:06.496
When we arrived,
there was no sign of the MALP.

01:06.600 --> 01:09.296
I checked our telemetry
based on known star positions.

01:09.402 --> 01:12.371
And we weren't on P3X-584, sir.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.466
Somehow, we got sent
to a different planet.

01:15.575 --> 01:19.067
-Walter?
-I'm reviewing gate diagnostic, sir.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.708
-How could this happen?
-lf it is a gate malfunction

01:22.816 --> 01:25.614
it's a pretty big one,
unlike any we've seen before.

01:25.719 --> 01:30.156
Chief, inform all offworld teams
to use the alpha site until further notice.

01:30.257 --> 01:31.224
Yes, sir.

01:31.324 --> 01:32.723
If there's something's wrong
with this gate,

01:32.826 --> 01:35.226
I wanna know what it is
before anyone else walks through it.

01:35.328 --> 01:37.125
-Yes, sir.
-Find the problem.

01:37.230 --> 01:40.131
Until we do, all gate activity is shut down.

02:53.673 --> 02:55.698
CARTER: Run
the cross-comparison program.

02:56.276 --> 02:59.575
-Hey, how's it going?
-As far as our computer is concerned

02:59.679 --> 03:03.206
the dialing sequence to P3X-584
ran perfectly normal.

03:03.316 --> 03:06.774
Except for the fact you ended up
12,000 light-years off-course.

03:08.955 --> 03:10.684
Oh, here's something.

03:15.896 --> 03:19.559
-CARTER: Maybe it wasn't our fault.
-I thought it was always our fault.

03:19.666 --> 03:22.157
We just ran a program
that compares the energy signatures

03:22.269 --> 03:25.295
of the last 30 outbound trips
to look for anomalies.

03:25.405 --> 03:28.340
-It's kind of like a bump.
-A bump?

03:30.944 --> 03:35.381
Actually, more like a series of bumps
exactly 8.5 seconds apart.

03:35.482 --> 03:37.950
Oh! Well, that explains everything.

03:38.585 --> 03:40.280
Actually, it might.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.388
-Defense mechanism?
-CARTER: Yes, sir.

03:45.492 --> 03:48.586
I think each of these spikes
represents a request by the offworld gate

03:48.695 --> 03:49.923
for an authorization code.

03:50.030 --> 03:52.396
If the correct authorization code
is not entered in time,

03:52.499 --> 03:54.933
you are prevented
from reaching the planet.

03:55.035 --> 03:59.438
That doesn't explain how you and SG-5
ended up halfway across the galaxy.

03:59.539 --> 04:01.507
CARTER: Well, I have a theory
about that, too.

04:01.608 --> 04:03.508
Instead of using an iris like we do,

04:03.610 --> 04:06.909
the offworld gate stores incoming data
in its buffer system.

04:07.013 --> 04:10.107
Then if the correct code isn't received,
it dials a random address

04:10.216 --> 04:12.377
and empties the buffer
into the new wormhole.

04:12.485 --> 04:15.045
Interstellar call forwarding.
That's pretty cool.

04:15.155 --> 04:16.782
How did the MALP get through to 584?

04:16.890 --> 04:19.450
I mean, initial telemetry confirmed
it was on the right planet.

04:19.559 --> 04:22.653
My guess is the 584 security system
filters incoming matter

04:22.762 --> 04:26.596
based on certain protocol.
Organic versus inanimate, for instance.

04:26.700 --> 04:29.168
Well, that seems like
an awful lot of trouble to keep people out.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.635
Which makes me curious
as to what's being hidden there.

04:31.738 --> 04:33.899
You always want what you can't have.

04:34.407 --> 04:36.398
I've calculated it'll take the Prometheus
two weeks

04:36.509 --> 04:38.306
to reach 584 at maximum speed.

04:38.411 --> 04:42.609
If the Ori are constructing a supergate
there, we may not have that much time.

04:42.716 --> 04:45.810
I will contact the High Council
and have a Jaffa ship scout the area.

04:45.919 --> 04:49.150
Can you figure out a way
to crack this authorization code?

04:49.255 --> 04:50.722
We'll certainly try, sir.

04:50.824 --> 04:55.284
Teal'c, no offense, but I'd feel better
if we investigated this ourselves.

04:55.795 --> 04:57.092
Dismissed.

04:59.499 --> 05:01.023
(SIREN WAILING)

05:08.541 --> 05:09.974
HARRlMAN: MALP is en route.

05:10.276 --> 05:13.643
We've placed a bacterial culture
inside the MALP's cargo compartment.

05:13.747 --> 05:16.341
Hopefully, the organic material
will force the 584 gate

05:16.449 --> 05:18.917
to hold the MALP
and ask for an authorization code.

05:20.787 --> 05:23.255
I'm receiving the gate's
authorization request.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.617
Now we just hope this program works.

05:29.229 --> 05:32.198
-What does that mean?
-I think it was good.

05:33.433 --> 05:35.128
The MALP is coming online.

05:35.635 --> 05:37.398
Rotate the camera to the left.

05:43.043 --> 05:45.841
-It's the first MALP. It worked.
-Good.

05:58.458 --> 06:00.688
All right, let's see
what all the fuss is about.

06:00.794 --> 06:04.389
We'll have to wait till nightfall to get
a visual confirmation of a black hole.

06:04.497 --> 06:07.330
In the meantime, Major,
you can set up the gravity sensors.

06:09.269 --> 06:11.237
I'll make sure we can dial home.

06:14.741 --> 06:17.904
SGC, this is SG-1 leader.
We have arrived safely.

06:18.111 --> 06:20.909
LANDRY ON RADIO: Thank you, Colonel.
We'II dial again in 15 minutes.

06:21.014 --> 06:22.481
Prometheus is standing by.

06:22.582 --> 06:24.641
Hopefully that won't be necessary, sir.

06:24.751 --> 06:25.911
Mitchell out.

06:28.421 --> 06:30.753
I'd rather not wait around
two weeks for a ride.

06:30.857 --> 06:32.620
We're gonna go have a look around.

06:40.433 --> 06:42.230
I think I found the problem.

06:43.103 --> 06:45.435
-You seen anything like it before?
-Nope.

06:45.638 --> 06:49.165
And I don't wanna remove it until I know
exactly how it's connected to the system.

06:49.275 --> 06:51.539
The good news is it won't affect
any outbound dialing.

06:51.644 --> 06:52.668
ALTMAN ON RADIO: Colonel Carter,

06:52.779 --> 06:55.179
we've got the gravity sensors
up and running.

06:55.281 --> 06:57.511
-Good, I'll be right there.
-JA CKSON: Hey, guys, it's Daniel.

06:57.617 --> 07:00.347
You might wanna come
and check this out first.

07:00.453 --> 07:02.751
I got it. You check out the black hole.

07:06.659 --> 07:09.628
Wow, it's amazing
what people leave laying around.

07:10.330 --> 07:13.231
-Where do those go?
-Only one way to find out.

07:37.991 --> 07:40.551
MlTCHELL: I don't think anyone's
been home for a while.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.457
JACKSON: Looks like some kind
of science lab.

07:49.602 --> 07:51.229
This looks familiar.

07:53.406 --> 07:55.806
It's Nirrti's DNA manipulation device.

07:55.909 --> 07:56.933
Nirrti?

07:57.043 --> 08:00.501
She was the Goa'uld that was trying
to create an advanced host, right?

08:00.613 --> 08:03.275
Ended up with a bunch of super freaks
who turned on her.

08:03.383 --> 08:05.010
That was a cool file.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.261
This writing is in Ancient.

08:27.807 --> 08:29.570
Oh, I was wrong.

08:32.145 --> 08:34.010
There is someone home.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.686
Wait, wait.

08:43.790 --> 08:46.918
What? I was looking for the light switch.

08:49.529 --> 08:52.089
-New guy.
-Hey, you touched that!

08:52.198 --> 08:54.132

09:12.919 --> 09:14.113
Carter, get back to the gate.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.882
Tell the SGC we need a med team here
right away.

09:21.361 --> 09:25.491
Well, you're clean. No sign
of any exposure to infectious agents.

09:25.598 --> 09:28.499
-Great. How's Pod Man?
-Also going to be fine.

09:28.601 --> 09:31.365
I suspect the convulsions were just
a reaction to coming out of stasis.

09:31.471 --> 09:33.871
Although his preliminary test results
were quite interesting.

09:33.973 --> 09:35.133
How?

09:35.241 --> 09:37.835
We've been able to study
the genetic characteristics of the Ancients

09:37.944 --> 09:40.276
from the database sent back to us
from Atlantis.

09:40.380 --> 09:44.009
Our Patient X definitely shows
some physiological similarities.

09:44.450 --> 09:47.214
-Do you think he's an Ancient?
-I'm running a more detailed analysis.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.810
There were some other strange anomalies.

09:48.921 --> 09:51.549
But in the meantime,
why don't we ask him?

10:00.133 --> 10:01.293
Hello.

10:04.704 --> 10:07.605

-(WHISPERING) Yes.
-Good. Try to relax.

There's nothing to be afraid of.
You're safe.

You're on a planet called Earth.

of the United States Air Force.

Can you tell us your name?

10:30.163 --> 10:33.132
-lt is Khalek.
-Khalek.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.761
We found you on another planet, in stasis,

10:36.869 --> 10:39.804
in what looked like
some sort of science lab.

10:42.909 --> 10:45.434
-Earth?
-Yeah, that's right.

10:45.712 --> 10:47.111

10:51.951 --> 10:54.146
Home? Where is home?

10:54.921 --> 10:56.252
He took me.

10:56.989 --> 10:58.581
I was a prisoner.

11:00.393 --> 11:01.587
So long.

11:03.963 --> 11:05.931
He did experiments on me.

11:06.699 --> 11:07.859
He who?

11:08.434 --> 11:10.265
I never knew his name.

11:12.372 --> 11:16.069
Please, I just want to go home.

-The symbols to dial?
-Yes.

11:24.650 --> 11:28.552
Okay. When you're feeling better,
we'll see what we can do.

11:36.062 --> 11:38.428
-So not an Ancient.
-Too bad.

11:39.165 --> 11:41.224
Poor guy. This is exactly what Nirrti did.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.461
Kidnapped people
and then experimented on them.

11:43.569 --> 11:45.730
Yeah, but Khalek there said "he."

11:45.838 --> 11:47.669
Well, I'm sure Nirrti
wasn't the only Goa'uld

11:47.774 --> 11:49.742
with an interest in evolved human hosts.

11:49.842 --> 11:52.606
That lab looked more Ancient
than Goa'uld.

11:53.746 --> 11:56.476
You think it was an Ancient
experimenting on him?

11:57.216 --> 11:58.615
I don't know,

11:58.718 --> 12:01.118
but I'm sure Jackson
will get to the bottom of it.

12:01.220 --> 12:03.415
In the meantime, we'll get the address
to Khalek's homeworld

12:03.523 --> 12:05.013
and send a MALP.

12:05.124 --> 12:08.321

Well, looks like that black hole
is just a regular old black hole.

12:25.378 --> 12:28.313
-No giant Ori supergates.
-That's good.

12:29.182 --> 12:30.774
Teal'c said you could use some help
in here.

12:30.883 --> 12:32.646
Yeah, there's something wrong
with the power supply.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.516
-It's driving me nuts.
-Well, we'll look into it.

12:36.389 --> 12:39.517
Colonel Mitchell says the man we found
in stasis is not an Ancient.

12:39.625 --> 12:42.287
He was being held prisoner
and experimented upon.

12:42.395 --> 12:44.522
They do not believe
that he knew his captor.

12:45.097 --> 12:46.621
Have you found anything, Daniel Jackson?

-Under guard?
-Why? What did you find?

13:05.418 --> 13:06.715
I should've known
when I saw the Ancient writing.

13:06.819 --> 13:09.083
-He used to use it as code on his ships.
-Dr. Jackson...

13:09.188 --> 13:12.214
-The lab does not belong to an Ancient.
-lt belonged to Anubis.

13:12.325 --> 13:13.417
But he's long gone now.

13:13.526 --> 13:15.721
Yes, but the man he left behind
is not a victim of experiments.

13:15.828 --> 13:18.422
He's a genetic hybrid.
He was grown in that lab.

13:18.531 --> 13:19.520
I'm sorry?

13:19.632 --> 13:21.122
(SIGHING) Whatever he told you, he's lying.

The Goa'uld pass on genetic memory.
Now he may not have a snake in his head,

13:24.337 --> 13:25.827
but the man we defrosted
and brought back here

13:25.938 --> 13:27.599
has Goa'uld DNA
intermingled with his own.

13:27.707 --> 13:30.232
He may as well be the son of Anubis.

13:39.519 --> 13:42.886
The log entry said Anubis managed
to replicate his pre-Ascension DNA

13:42.989 --> 13:44.889
using the genetic manipulation device.

13:44.991 --> 13:47.016
Then, he combined it with human DNA

13:47.126 --> 13:50.027
and was able to rapidly grow
our friend there.

13:50.129 --> 13:54.225
The analysis I did suggests that Khalek
is significantly more evolved than we are.

13:54.333 --> 13:57.928
Much more in line with the human form
of the Ancients prior to Ascension.

13:58.037 --> 14:00.733
So he could have
all kinds of super-funky powers.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.273
The subjects Nirrti manipulated

14:02.375 --> 14:04.639
demonstrated telekinetic
and psychic abilities.

14:04.744 --> 14:05.802
Like the Priors.

14:05.912 --> 14:08.745
The goal of the experiments seems to
have been to create an advanced human.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.180
With a little Anubis blended in.

14:11.517 --> 14:13.485
CARTER: You said he used
his pre-ascended DNA.

14:13.586 --> 14:15.918
Do you think he was doing these
experiments before he ascended?

14:16.022 --> 14:17.751
No, you see, that time line
doesn't track with the log.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.257
Plus, it says he had to reproduce his DNA.

14:20.359 --> 14:22.350
Which means he was doing all this
after he ascended,

14:22.461 --> 14:25.396
and was sent back by the Ancients,
well, halfway.

14:25.498 --> 14:26.988
But this doesn't make any sense.

14:27.099 --> 14:30.591
Even a highly evolved human host
wouldn't be as advanced as he was.

14:30.703 --> 14:33.263
-Why bother?
-Maybe he didn't like being stuck in limbo.

14:33.372 --> 14:36.808
Maybe even a small step back to mortality
was worth it to him on some level.

14:36.909 --> 14:39.571
Perhaps he was attempting to create
an even more powerful servant

14:39.679 --> 14:40.646
than the Kull warriors.

14:40.746 --> 14:45.084
No matter what Anubis' ultimate goal
was, Khalek is extremely dangerous.

14:45.084 --> 14:45.106
No matter what Anubis' ultimate goal
was, Khalek is extremely dangerous.

14:45.718 --> 14:48.118
-Options?
-Put him back in his pod.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.780
I doubt we'd be able to get the one
from 584 back here.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.552
If we leave him there,
others could circumvent the security

14:53.659 --> 14:54.785
and find him as we did.

14:54.894 --> 14:57.385
-We could post guards.
-What about the Antarctica pod?

14:57.496 --> 14:58.986
(CHUCKLING) Look,
I think we need to consider

14:59.098 --> 15:01.089
whether we wanna preserve him at all.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.167
Hmm.

15:08.007 --> 15:10.669
Look, the fact is, we don't know
how successful Anubis was.

15:10.776 --> 15:14.075
Khalek is advanced, yes, but we
don't know how far along he actually is.

15:14.180 --> 15:16.580
Now, if he is aware of his own state
of evolutionary advancement,

15:16.682 --> 15:18.206
and I'll bet you anything he is,

15:18.317 --> 15:20.785
then it's possible the only thing
keeping him from ascending right now

15:20.886 --> 15:22.478
is that he hasn't figured out how.

15:22.588 --> 15:26.080
-What would that take?
-I don't know, but if he can do it,

15:26.792 --> 15:29.022
if he knows how or figures out how,
at the very least,

15:29.128 --> 15:31.062
we're gonna have another Anubis
on our hands.

15:31.163 --> 15:33.654
And at that point,
it's gonna be too late to stop him.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.633
Well, he couldn't progress
his state of being while he was in stasis.

15:36.736 --> 15:39.569
Look, you know
I would never suggest this lightly,

15:40.873 --> 15:42.636
but he is what he is,

15:43.676 --> 15:46.110
and given the danger he poses,
I think we have to ask ourselves,

15:46.212 --> 15:48.442
what is the point
in keeping him alive at all?

15:55.988 --> 15:57.751
I hear you, Dr. Jackson.

15:58.624 --> 16:02.060
For the moment we're taking
every security precaution we can.

16:02.161 --> 16:06.063
I'll contact Washington,
discuss how we're going to proceed.

16:06.332 --> 16:10.098
In the meantime, I suggest
all of you learn as much as you can,

16:10.202 --> 16:13.638
including what Khalek does
and doesn't know.

16:23.149 --> 16:24.946
Khalek, can you hear me?

16:27.887 --> 16:28.911
(WHISPERING) Yes.

16:30.122 --> 16:32.352
My name is Dr. Daniel Jackson.

16:37.296 --> 16:39.560
Why have you restrained me like this?

16:41.667 --> 16:44.033
Why is everyone suddenly acting
like they fear me?

16:44.136 --> 16:45.933
Look, you can drop the act.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.170
I don't understand.

16:51.110 --> 16:53.408
Have you contacted my homeworld?

16:54.313 --> 16:56.781
We found you on your homeworld.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.313
I understand Ancient.

17:01.420 --> 17:04.082
Those research notes Anubis Ieft...

17:06.726 --> 17:09.422
We know that you were grown in that Iab.

17:10.162 --> 17:12.255
That you possess Anubis ' DNA

17:12.732 --> 17:14.859
and his genetic memories.

17:24.410 --> 17:27.208
My memories do include you, Dr. Jackson.

17:29.181 --> 17:32.014
A confrontation you once had
with my father.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.911
I sense it is some time
since I was Iast awake.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.148
What has become ofhim?

17:39.258 --> 17:41.488
I'm not here to answer your questions.

17:42.194 --> 17:43.525
The others,

17:44.830 --> 17:47.094
they wish to study me, don't they?

17:47.900 --> 17:51.859
Why else would I still be here,
given the danger you know I pose?

17:52.805 --> 17:56.536
They want to learn what I am,
how I came to be.

17:57.510 --> 17:58.807
But you...

18:01.614 --> 18:04.014
Have you ever taken a life, Dr. Jackson?

18:07.787 --> 18:11.223
I believe you have killed a man.

18:16.662 --> 18:19.130
My memories are so sharp and clear.

18:19.565 --> 18:22.363
It's as if they happened only moments ago.

18:22.701 --> 18:25.499
The countless lives
my father extinguished,

18:25.838 --> 18:28.636
of those that came before him
and did the same.

18:28.774 --> 18:29.763
(SIGHS)

18:29.875 --> 18:31.934
(WHISPERING) Such pleasure it gave them.

18:33.846 --> 18:36.610
But I have not experienced it myself yet.

18:37.950 --> 18:41.215
Does it really feel that good?

18:43.656 --> 18:46.216
Millions of slaves bowing before me,

18:46.926 --> 18:50.259
a galaxy of desperate, pitiful life forms
at my feet.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.223
That's clearly intoxicating.

18:53.632 --> 18:58.296
I can almost taste it as ifit was me there
and not those whose memories I possess.

18:59.839 --> 19:01.306
But nothing...

19:02.308 --> 19:05.471
Nothing do I anticipate more
than the sweetness I know I will feel

19:05.578 --> 19:07.876
when I kill for the first time.

19:09.715 --> 19:13.879
I can hardly wait to watch
as fear stops a man's heart.

19:15.087 --> 19:17.715
So much more intimate,

19:19.124 --> 19:20.455
one-on-one

19:21.827 --> 19:25.263
to watch as the blood flows from his veins

19:25.598 --> 19:28.567
and savor his ever-fading hope for life.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.972
There's only one way to stop it.

19:34.940 --> 19:37.067
I know you wish to take my life.

19:37.176 --> 19:40.475
And I promise you, before this is over,

19:41.313 --> 19:44.942
one of us will feel the pleasure.

20:07.373 --> 20:11.070
Mr. Woolsey. Given the timing,
this can't be a good sign.

20:12.111 --> 20:14.477
The lnternational Committee
overseeing the SGC

20:14.580 --> 20:16.377
has read and considered
your recommendation

20:16.482 --> 20:18.712
to place the prisoner back in stasis.

20:18.817 --> 20:21.342
At least until we can decide
what to do with him.

20:22.021 --> 20:23.488
We think that's a mistake.

20:24.423 --> 20:27.290
-Oh, you think we should kill him?
-On the contrary,

20:27.760 --> 20:29.660
we think he must be studied.

20:31.897 --> 20:34.195
You understand how dangerous he is.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.165
We understand how dangerous
you seem to think he is.

20:36.268 --> 20:38.862
There's very little
corroborating evidence at this point.

20:38.971 --> 20:41.132
That's why more study is required.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.007
Is this a joke?

20:44.109 --> 20:46.441
Because if you look closely,
I'm not laughing.

20:48.213 --> 20:50.977
You and your people went before
the Senate Appropriations Committee

20:51.083 --> 20:55.042
and demanded that the budget
for this facility not be cut in half. Why?

20:55.154 --> 20:58.453
Because of a formidable new enemy
that now threatens our galaxy.

20:58.724 --> 21:00.589
What would we do without you?

21:01.393 --> 21:03.987
All we have heard is that the Ori

21:04.096 --> 21:06.394
must be taken more seriously
than the Goa'uld.

21:06.498 --> 21:09.695
That the Priors who represent them
are extremely powerful and dangerous

21:09.802 --> 21:10.894
in their own right.

21:11.003 --> 21:13.639
And yet, in the months
since this threat emerged,

21:13.639 --> 21:14.196
And yet, in the months
since this threat emerged,

21:14.340 --> 21:18.470
not one proposed countermeasure,
not one shred of technology,

21:18.577 --> 21:22.240
not even so much as a theory
or strategy to fight these missionaries

21:22.348 --> 21:26.648
has resulted from ongoing
stargate operations, until now.

21:27.720 --> 21:31.178
-And you want to freeze him.
-Go, go. You're on a roll.

21:32.524 --> 21:35.322
Based on the report, the only thing
that we do know about this Khalek

21:35.427 --> 21:39.830
is that physiologically, he may be
very much like the Priors of the Ori,

21:40.165 --> 21:44.033
an advanced form of human far along
in evolutionary development.

21:44.136 --> 21:48.163
First and foremost,
studying him may be the key

21:48.273 --> 21:50.741
to learning a way to fight the Priors.

21:50.843 --> 21:54.040
-Actually, that had not escaped me.
-Not to mention the fact that he may be

21:54.146 --> 21:56.512
the missing link
between ourselves and Ascension.

21:56.615 --> 21:58.879
Certainly that merits more research.

21:58.984 --> 22:02.818
The members of the Committee
feel very strongly about this.

22:03.188 --> 22:06.351
Then neither they nor you
understand the risks.

22:07.593 --> 22:08.924
Oh, we do.

22:10.929 --> 22:13.989
The issue is, if this command doesn't have

22:14.099 --> 22:17.535
the ability and security in place
to take full advantage

22:17.636 --> 22:19.536
of an opportunity like this,

22:19.738 --> 22:22.229
then we believe
we need to re-evaluate its leadership,

22:22.341 --> 22:25.970
and ultimately its operation.

22:33.819 --> 22:36.913
If Woolsey and the bean counters are
gonna force us to keep Khalek conscious,

22:37.022 --> 22:39.616
maybe we better figure out
what he's capable of and fast.

22:39.725 --> 22:42.956
It was like he was goading me
into killing him, like he wanted us to do it.

22:43.062 --> 22:45.792
He knows he's on the path to Ascension,
maybe he thinks that's the final step.

22:45.898 --> 22:48.025
If that's the case, we have
no other choice but to freeze him again.

22:48.133 --> 22:51.102
-With strict instructions never to defrost.
-TEAL'C: lndeed.

22:51.637 --> 22:55.971
Unfortunately, we must now convince
others this is the prudent course of action.

22:56.075 --> 22:58.441
Major Altman seems to think
he has something that will help us.

22:58.544 --> 23:00.808
ALTMAN: Yeah, this unit,
it seems to be self-contained.

23:00.913 --> 23:04.178
Well, it's what analyzes
a subject's current physiological status

23:04.283 --> 23:06.649
and feeds back into the DNA manipulator.

23:06.752 --> 23:08.379
We should be able to bring it back with us

23:08.487 --> 23:12.048
and rig it to give us a better idea
of how advanced Khalek really is.

23:12.157 --> 23:14.955
That'd be good. Nice work.

23:15.360 --> 23:17.794
I'm gonna keep working on the translation.

23:23.535 --> 23:25.025
He's out cold, Colonel.

23:25.137 --> 23:27.605
I gave him enough sedative
to keep him out for hours.

23:27.706 --> 23:29.401
You can't be too sure.

23:29.508 --> 23:32.272
That should be good.

23:37.816 --> 23:40.842
CARTER: We're pretty sure these
red patches indicate areas of the brain

23:40.953 --> 23:43.751
where synaptic activity is maximized.

23:43.856 --> 23:48.259
A normal human brain, you or l, say,
should show roughly 5% to 10% coverage.

23:48.360 --> 23:50.419
Me being five, you being 10.

23:50.529 --> 23:52.520
So, what's that at now, 60%?

23:52.631 --> 23:54.565
CARTER: Sixty-eight, exactly.

23:54.666 --> 23:59.330
Daniel says the research theorized that 80,
possibly 90% activity was required

23:59.438 --> 24:01.133
for conscious, willful Ascension.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.037
-MlTCHELL: So he's not there yet.
-CARTER: Well, no, but...

24:03.142 --> 24:04.109
(BEEPING)

24:04.209 --> 24:05.836
Wait a minute. What's that?

24:06.745 --> 24:09.270
-That wasn't there a minute ago.
-CARTER: No.

24:09.982 --> 24:12.712
The percentage just jumped to 71.

24:12.818 --> 24:15.150
Are you saying this guy is evolving
right before our eyes?

24:15.254 --> 24:16.243
(MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY)

24:16.355 --> 24:17.379
His heart rate's increasing.

24:17.489 --> 24:19.457
I wonder if that has something to do
with the brain scan device.

24:19.558 --> 24:20.820
I'm gonna administer some more sedative.

24:20.926 --> 24:22.518
No, just a sec, let me just make sure

24:22.628 --> 24:25.222
that there's no interference
with the lines here.

24:26.932 --> 24:27.899
(GROANING)

24:32.471 --> 24:33.733
(EXCLAIMS)

24:40.445 --> 24:41.707
(THUDDING)

24:54.860 --> 24:59.024
I shot him twice at point-blank range.

24:59.364 --> 25:02.959
And he appears to be healing very quickly.

25:03.802 --> 25:05.963
I should've emptied the clip.

25:06.738 --> 25:08.569
I don't get it, sir.

25:09.208 --> 25:13.907
How can Woolsey not know
that keeping this guy around is a bad idea?

25:14.012 --> 25:15.377
He's an ass.

25:15.781 --> 25:19.308
So, what? He's risking a catastrophe
just to embarrass us?

25:19.418 --> 25:21.579
Woolsey's a pretty straight shooter.

25:21.687 --> 25:24.713
I think he really believes
this is gonna be of benefit.

25:24.823 --> 25:26.791
We're the ones
who've spent the last eight years

25:26.892 --> 25:29.952
justifying enormous risk
for the advancements we've made.

25:30.062 --> 25:32.496
LAM: The fact is, we are recording
some incredible data.

25:32.598 --> 25:35.192
Khalek's healing ability,
his advanced brain function.

25:35.300 --> 25:38.394
That scanner was still operating
when he was using his telekinetic ability

25:38.503 --> 25:40.494
and we've been able
to isolate the areas of the brain

25:40.606 --> 25:41.868
that he was maximizing at the time.

25:41.974 --> 25:45.808
See, l... I think the point is...
Is that he has telekinetic abilities

25:45.911 --> 25:50.109
and he's continuing to evolve
while we sit around yammering about it.

25:50.215 --> 25:53.446
All the while, he's getting closer
and closer to ascending.

26:09.701 --> 26:12.033
You should know
there are now 50,000 volts

26:12.137 --> 26:14.105
running through that floor, sir.

26:14.473 --> 26:16.964
And a Tok'ra shield generator
barring the door.

26:17.075 --> 26:21.409
It's one-way, so we can still
fire bullets in there if we ha ve to.

26:21.513 --> 26:23.811
Finally, Dr. Lam believes your abilities

26:23.915 --> 26:26.179
can be controlled
with a dopamine inhibitor.

26:26.285 --> 26:29.015
A shunt has been inserted
into the base of your skull

26:29.121 --> 26:33.057
and a massive dose will be automatically
injected should you try anything else.

26:33.158 --> 26:34.125
(SCOFFS)

26:34.860 --> 26:37.158
Thanks for the warning, Richard.

26:38.797 --> 26:40.697
Or do your prefer Dick?

26:42.601 --> 26:44.967
No, you didn't tell me your name.

26:45.737 --> 26:49.503
-Shame about Major AItman.
-He's going to be fine.

26:50.075 --> 26:51.372
We'll see.

26:52.577 --> 26:55.307
Any further outbursts
will not be tolerated.

26:55.414 --> 26:56.381
(SCOFFS)

26:56.682 --> 26:58.547
Whatever you say, Dick.

27:03.188 --> 27:05.986
(STARGATE OPENING)

27:09.728 --> 27:11.719
Hey, I heard you guys
could use some help.

27:11.830 --> 27:13.388
Yeah. We heard what happened.
How's Major Altman?

27:13.498 --> 27:15.056
Oh, he's gonna be okay.

27:15.167 --> 27:18.034
The ascendometer says
Khalek's about 80% there.

27:18.136 --> 27:20.229
-Ascendometer?
-Mitchell.

27:21.940 --> 27:23.532
Wish I'd thought of it.

27:23.642 --> 27:27.738
After Khalek was shot and started
to heal, it shot up another 5% or so.

27:27.846 --> 27:29.245
Yeah, we're helping him.

27:29.348 --> 27:32.442
The healing process helped him to learn
another aspect of his advancement.

27:32.551 --> 27:35.076
-I'll bet anything he wanted to get shot.
-You think?

27:35.187 --> 27:38.247
Well, according to the research,
the way it works is

27:38.357 --> 27:40.518
the subject gets a treatment
in this machine.

27:40.625 --> 27:43.719
And certain physiological changes
are made in the brain.

27:43.995 --> 27:46.327
Then it takes some time,
weeks, months, to adjust.

27:46.431 --> 27:48.991
The individual needs to get used
to the changes, learn how they work,

27:49.101 --> 27:51.661
it's a gradual process.
That's what the scans are showing us.

27:51.770 --> 27:53.397
Khalek is learning
to use the advancements

27:53.505 --> 27:54.767
the latest treatment gave him.

27:54.873 --> 27:56.670
Now, eventually
with enough physical evolution

27:56.775 --> 27:58.868
and mental control
he will reach a critical stage

27:58.977 --> 28:01.605
where he will learn to shed
his physical body and exist as energy.

28:01.713 --> 28:05.342
I always felt there was
a spiritual component to Ascension.

28:05.450 --> 28:07.577
That you had to be a good person
at heart to do it.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.654
Yes, certainly,
when there's an Ancient helping you.

28:09.755 --> 28:12.519
Well, obviously when the process happens
naturally there are no rules.

28:12.624 --> 28:14.558
Well, if you can call this naturally.

28:14.659 --> 28:17.526
Still, the Ori prove
you don't have to be moral to ascend.

28:17.629 --> 28:19.859
Who knows, maybe it's part
of the grand cosmic balance.

28:19.965 --> 28:21.830
Good and evil
have to co-exist on all levels.

28:21.933 --> 28:24.834
Well, for now, Khalek is still mortal.

28:24.970 --> 28:27.734
I don't think he really wants to die
before he's figured it all out.

28:27.839 --> 28:30.467
He's probably been hiding
the full extent of his powers from us.

28:30.575 --> 28:31.906
For all we know, he's mocking us

28:32.010 --> 28:34.444
because he knows
we can't really hurt him.

28:34.546 --> 28:35.447
-What else have you learned?
-Not much.

28:35.447 --> 28:36.505
-What else have you learned?
-Not much.

28:36.615 --> 28:39.015
I don't think this database
is gonna be much help anymore.

28:39.117 --> 28:40.243
We've been through it twice now.

28:40.352 --> 28:42.843
The reason I came is
because I have an idea.

28:43.255 --> 28:46.554
Based on the data we've collected
from the scans of Khalek's brain,

28:46.658 --> 28:49.218
I'm thinking that we can run a simulation
on the DNA machine

28:49.327 --> 28:50.988
to see where it's really going.

28:51.096 --> 28:54.463
To the best of our knowledge
this has never been done before, right?

28:54.566 --> 28:57.729
Artificially advance a human being
to Ascension using technology

28:57.836 --> 28:59.929
rather than the help
of another ascended being.

29:00.038 --> 29:01.335
JACKSON: The log is incomplete.

29:01.440 --> 29:04.932
Anubis seems to have been stopped
before he could finish his experiments.

29:05.043 --> 29:07.409
Let's see if it's really going
where we think it is.

29:07.512 --> 29:10.310
I mean, at the very least,
maybe get a time frame.

29:16.822 --> 29:18.016
General.

29:19.758 --> 29:23.057
I'm reconsidering the arrangement
with the lnternational Committee

29:23.161 --> 29:24.958
that's keeping you here.

29:25.997 --> 29:27.828
Then I suggest you start going through
your budget

29:27.933 --> 29:29.093
because without their support...

29:29.201 --> 29:32.034
How can you still be convinced
that this is the right course of action?

29:32.137 --> 29:34.833
The scans indicate
his advancement has plateaued

29:34.940 --> 29:37.340
at roughly 80% of potential brain activity.

29:37.442 --> 29:40.104
That might have something to do
with the dopamine inhibitor.

29:40.212 --> 29:42.009
LANDRY: How long are we
gonna keep this up?

29:42.113 --> 29:45.605
Until we find a way to counteract
someone with his abilities in the field.

29:45.717 --> 29:49.710
According to your own account,
the man was able to read your mind.

29:49.821 --> 29:52.381
-Doesn't that concern you?
-Gravely.

29:53.191 --> 29:55.751
The fact that there are dozens of Priors
with abilities like his

29:55.861 --> 29:58.625
roaming the galaxy right now
also concerns me.

29:58.730 --> 30:02.131
And the Committee representing
the free nations of this planet, General.

30:02.234 --> 30:06.102
For the moment, in my opinion,
this situation is under control.

30:12.777 --> 30:17.840
I certainly hope that the point at
which you change your mind isn't too late.

30:39.771 --> 30:41.261
You wanted to see me?

30:42.073 --> 30:43.597
I'm pulling the plug.

30:43.742 --> 30:47.906
You can notify the Committee that
the SGC no longer requires their support.

30:48.013 --> 30:51.449
General, Khalek's condition is stable.

30:51.550 --> 30:54.110
You've taken ample security precautions.

30:54.219 --> 30:57.313
Every minute we have
to study him, record data,

30:57.422 --> 31:00.255
the closer we get to a means
of fighting the Priors.

31:00.358 --> 31:03.759
Not to mention the possibility of solving
the mysteries of our own existence.

31:03.862 --> 31:06.092
The issues we face
can be overwhelming at times.

31:06.197 --> 31:08.324
I can see how someone
might lose their perspective.

31:08.433 --> 31:09.923
I haven't lost perspective, General.

31:10.068 --> 31:12.935
I recognize the importance
of this research.

31:13.204 --> 31:16.002
That's why I'm not gonna
let you stand in the way.

31:16.575 --> 31:18.941
Ultimately, the decision is mine.

31:21.079 --> 31:26.016
I'm having Khalek transferred back
to his stasis pod on 584 immediately,

31:26.651 --> 31:29.677
regardless of the consequences
to this command.

31:30.488 --> 31:31.785
Thank you.

31:55.714 --> 31:57.443

31:57.549 --> 32:00.882
-You said Khalek has had five treatments?
-Yeah, according to the log.

32:00.986 --> 32:04.012
Well, then this is where
he should be now on the chart.

32:04.122 --> 32:08.024
-Does that mean what I think it means?
-We need to report this to Landry.

32:08.460 --> 32:12.294
Yeah. There's one more thing
I think you should do first.

32:18.169 --> 32:19.693
MITCHELL: Just to give you a heads up,

32:19.804 --> 32:22.068
we're gonna keep you attached
all the way home.

through to place him back in stasis.

33:02.113 --> 33:05.105
Bad idea, 584's the last place
we should be taking him right now.

33:05.216 --> 33:07.912
In fact, it was probably
what he was hoping for.

33:10.789 --> 33:11.881
This is General Landry.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.652
LANDRY: Belay the order.
Resecure the prisoner.

33:18.329 --> 33:19.921
Back in the seat.

33:23.435 --> 33:25.801
Now, explain why I just did that.

33:25.904 --> 33:27.769
The reason
his advancement has plateaued

33:27.872 --> 33:30.272
is not because of the dopamine inhibitor.

33:35.947 --> 33:37.209
JACKSON: He's gone as far as he can.

33:37.315 --> 33:39.909
Now he may have learned to use the
physical advancements he now has,

33:40.018 --> 33:41.815
but he'll never be able to ascend
in his current state.

33:41.920 --> 33:45.253
He needs more treatments
from that machine to make it happen.
