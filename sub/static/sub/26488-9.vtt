Does she like cinnamon?

independence movement?

A movement that hasn'’t achieved
its aim in over 80 years.

08:01.132 --> 08:03.570
The referendum vote
on independence

08:03.700 --> 08:06.573
passed by 90%
only a few years ago.With a turnout

08:06.703 --> 08:09.097
of 43% and your
constitutional accord

08:09.227 --> 08:12.230
discredited the
vote anyway.
And we are still
restabilizing.

08:12.361 --> 08:14.798
Come on.You have to understand,
this was all

08:14.929 --> 08:17.148
very recent
and very real.

08:17.279 --> 08:20.021
Do you know what else
was recent and real?

08:20.151 --> 08:23.503
Serbia'’s attempt
to banish or kill

08:23.633 --> 08:26.462
its entire ethnic Albanian
population in the late '’90s.

08:26.593 --> 08:29.247
And yet,
Kosovo is willing

08:29.378 --> 08:31.641
to set that aside
and cooperate with Serbia

08:31.772 --> 08:33.077
for the sake of this deal.

08:33.208 --> 08:36.385
Here'’s the part
that I don'’t get.

08:36.516 --> 08:39.475
Two weeks ago, we had
a pledge from your staff

08:39.606 --> 08:43.261
that your country
was fully on board.

08:43.392 --> 08:46.177
Wouldn'’t have called
a summit otherwise.And then,

08:46.308 --> 08:47.701
this showed up.

08:51.618 --> 08:53.533
Threats of violence.

08:53.663 --> 08:54.925
Mass protest.

08:55.056 --> 08:57.754
The assassination of
key cabinet members.

08:57.885 --> 08:59.147
It'’s very alarming.

09:01.323 --> 09:05.109
If recognizing Kosovo
causes unrest in Spain,

09:05.240 --> 09:06.720
it'’s your right,

09:06.850 --> 09:10.201
as a NATO member,
to engage all of our help.

09:10.332 --> 09:13.683
But it is also your duty,
as a NATO member,

09:13.814 --> 09:15.772
to keep the world
stable and safe.

09:15.903 --> 09:20.298
That'’s what
this deal does.

09:20.429 --> 09:22.736
Spain is really willing
to be the sole voice

09:22.866 --> 09:24.259

everybody back to the table,

to tank this deal.

at a construction site

any responsibility.

you can on that.

in Angola and Sri Lanka,

20:46.810 --> 20:49.378
we'’ll be asking for ID
on all the fake news stories.

20:49.509 --> 20:50.814
DAISY: Tech CEOs
love cooperating

20:50.945 --> 20:52.294
with the government,
so that should go well.

20:52.425 --> 20:53.600
ELIZABETH:
Wait a second.

20:53.730 --> 20:56.211
Who-Who'’s their CEO?
What'’s his name? The...

20:56.342 --> 20:57.560
Scott. Scott Goodman.

20:57.691 --> 21:01.085
Scott Goodman.
So play to his ego.

21:01.216 --> 21:05.307
Tell him he'’ll be the new hero
in the war on fake news.

21:05.438 --> 21:06.439
MATT:
He'’s a fanboy.

21:06.569 --> 21:08.005
Bring him a cape.

21:08.136 --> 21:10.051
I can 100%
get you a cape.

21:12.793 --> 21:17.188
Let'’s see how I do
with words first.

21:17.319 --> 21:21.889
Dr. McCord. I don'’t think
I'’ve introduced myself yet.

21:22.019 --> 21:23.412
Daniel Reese,
White House physician.

21:23.543 --> 21:26.197
Of course. Good to
meet you, Dr. Reese.

21:26.328 --> 21:28.635
I understand you got
an unexpected visit

21:28.765 --> 21:30.289
from Gordon Becker
the other night.

21:30.419 --> 21:32.726
Yeah, Gordon and I
spoke about it.

21:32.856 --> 21:34.771
Noctambulism is,
unfortunately,

21:34.902 --> 21:37.296
a pretty common side effect from
the sleep aid he'’d been taking.

21:37.426 --> 21:38.732
I gave him
a lower dosage.

21:38.862 --> 21:40.386
Great.

21:40.516 --> 21:42.997
I saw your request for
Gordon'’s medication records.

21:43.127 --> 21:46.392
I just wanted to reassure you
that I have no concerns

21:46.522 --> 21:48.350
about the Secretary'’s
health whatsoever.

21:48.481 --> 21:51.048
It'’s just a standard incident
report, but thank you.

21:51.179 --> 21:53.529
I understand that you are
the new ethics advisor

21:53.660 --> 21:55.139
and that you want
to follow protocol,

21:55.270 --> 21:56.793
but, uh, sometimes
a report,

21:56.924 --> 21:58.578
with all the cyber
security issues

21:58.708 --> 22:02.277
we'’re facing can make sensitive
information vulnerable.

22:02.408 --> 22:04.366
I'’ll submit everything
in hard copy.

22:04.497 --> 22:09.066
Good. Thank you. Uh,
how'’s Alison, by the way?

22:09.197 --> 22:10.938
Uh, my daughter?

22:11.068 --> 22:13.767
She'’s fine.
Good, good.

22:13.897 --> 22:16.160
Your wife came to me
for some erythromycin

22:16.291 --> 22:20.295
for her a few weeks back, and...Uh...

22:20.426 --> 22:22.471
Cough'’s cleared up?
Uh, yeah.

22:22.602 --> 22:23.472
Thanks for,
thanks for that.

22:23.603 --> 22:25.953
Sure, sure. I, uh...

22:26.083 --> 22:28.695
Just my way of keeping people
focused on their work.

22:28.825 --> 22:29.391
[chuckles]

22:31.915 --> 22:33.090
So...

22:33.221 --> 22:35.702
Nice meeting you.
Take care, Henry.

22:40.271 --> 22:42.099
Mr. DeCosta,
Blake Moran,

22:42.230 --> 22:43.318
nice to meet you.

22:43.449 --> 22:45.059
Welcome to Global
Health Diplomacy.

22:45.189 --> 22:48.279
You'’re the new P.A.
on 7, right?

22:48.410 --> 22:50.151
Recently promoted, yes.

22:50.281 --> 22:53.633
Uh, so I'’ve been through your
impeccably put together reports

22:53.763 --> 22:57.985
on the antimalarial initiative,
and I have to say...

22:58.115 --> 22:59.682
That is an excellent
pocket square.

22:59.813 --> 23:02.468
Oh, thank you.
I like yours, too.

23:02.598 --> 23:03.817
Also impressive?

23:03.947 --> 23:06.036
Global Health Diplomacy'’s
stellar results

23:06.167 --> 23:08.256
in reducing the spread
of malaria this year.

23:08.387 --> 23:11.172
The insecticide-treated nets
were a real breakthrough.

23:11.302 --> 23:13.827
Yes. Well, uh, I see
no reason not to recommend

23:13.957 --> 23:17.961
your continued funding,
so if you would just

23:18.092 --> 23:20.834
sign here saying that we had
this review session...

23:20.964 --> 23:24.098
You got it.
All right.

23:24.228 --> 23:27.536
Don'’t forget
the stamp.
Oh.

23:27.667 --> 23:30.452
Great, thank you.

23:30.583 --> 23:31.888
Here you are.

23:32.019 --> 23:35.152
Here you are.
One funding recommendation

23:35.283 --> 23:37.764
for the Office of Global Health
Diplomacy'’s highly effective

23:37.894 --> 23:39.374
anti-malaria initiative.

23:39.505 --> 23:42.290
Ah, cool beans.
Oh, hang on.

23:42.421 --> 23:43.770
This just came in this morning.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.946
The Bureau of Oceans
and International Environmental

23:46.076 --> 23:48.035
and Scientific Affairs
filed an objection

23:48.165 --> 23:50.907
to the anti-malaria
initiative.

23:51.038 --> 23:52.300
So, we'’re going to need
their approval

23:52.431 --> 23:54.171
before we file
the recommendation.

23:54.302 --> 23:57.479
Really?
Yeah.

23:57.610 --> 23:59.307
Don'’t forget to get a stamp.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.919
TOM:
Yeah, no,

24:03.050 --> 24:05.052
OES has a big problem
with this initiative.

24:05.182 --> 24:06.053
Yeah, that much I got.

24:07.358 --> 24:08.142
Yeah. See, when we were asked
to contribute

24:08.272 --> 24:09.883
one-third of Global
Health Diplomacy'’s

24:10.013 --> 24:11.841
operating budget
for this initiative,

24:11.972 --> 24:14.017
we didn'’t realize their
main strategy was to basically

24:14.148 --> 24:17.978
blanket the entire equatorial
region in poisoned nets.

24:18.108 --> 24:19.980
The insecticide-treated
sleeping nets

24:20.110 --> 24:21.329
that cut malaria
death rates in half?

24:21.460 --> 24:22.809
Those nets?

24:22.939 --> 24:24.375
No one'’s disputing
they do an effective job

24:24.506 --> 24:25.768
of killing mosquitoes,

24:25.899 --> 24:28.075
but they'’re also great
at killing fish.

24:28.205 --> 24:31.470
So you'’ve got people
all over sub-Saharan Africa

24:31.600 --> 24:33.950
polluting the waters
with carcinogenic chemicals

24:34.081 --> 24:36.562
and basically gutting
the fish supply.

24:36.692 --> 24:39.042
Which means, instead of malaria,
we'’re now heading for famine.

24:39.173 --> 24:41.001
Okay, before we go
to worst-case scenarios...

24:41.131 --> 24:43.438
Not worst-case
scenario, Blake.

24:43.569 --> 24:46.310
This is happening now. Look.

24:46.441 --> 24:49.923
This... ah, this is
the last five years

24:50.053 --> 24:53.492
of fishing stocks
in Lakes Victoria,

24:53.622 --> 24:58.453
Tanganyika,
and Malawi.

24:58.584 --> 25:01.500
[exhales]
All right.

25:01.630 --> 25:04.024
There'’s got to be
a solution.

25:04.154 --> 25:06.722
Maybe... maybe distribute
untreated nets?

25:06.853 --> 25:09.508
Um... in a
different color.

25:09.638 --> 25:12.249
And then educate the population
which ones are safe for fishing.

25:12.380 --> 25:14.817
Okay, twice the nets,

25:14.948 --> 25:17.037
plus education materials,
plus staff.

25:17.167 --> 25:19.648
Is that coming out
of OES'’ budget?

25:19.779 --> 25:21.607
I don'’t think so.

25:24.348 --> 25:26.612
Not leaving here
with a stamp, am I? [chuckles]

25:29.049 --> 25:30.703
[pop version of "Jingle Bells"
playing loudly]

25:40.843 --> 25:43.411
Do you know where I can
find Scott Goodman?

25:43.542 --> 25:45.544
Over there.
In the...

25:45.674 --> 25:47.981
Thanks.
Thank you.

25:50.461 --> 25:53.987
Uh, Scott Goodman?
Yeah.

25:54.117 --> 25:55.858
Jay Whitman from
the State Department.

25:55.989 --> 25:58.426
Hey, man, good to see you.
You want some punch?

25:58.557 --> 26:00.080
No, thanks.

26:00.210 --> 26:02.952
Look, I'’m sorry to crash
the party, but it'’s urgent.

26:03.083 --> 26:06.086
Oh, I doubt that
it'’s life-and-death.

26:06.216 --> 26:07.653
Hm? Can it wait?

26:07.783 --> 26:10.830
Actually, it is life-and-death,
and you'’re part of it.

26:10.960 --> 26:13.833
[woman laughing]

26:13.963 --> 26:15.051
Five people have been
injured, three dead,

26:15.182 --> 26:16.705
one of them a
12-year-old boy.

26:16.836 --> 26:19.795
All posted on Kronic'’s social
media network in the Balkans.

26:19.926 --> 26:22.102
We can post a statement
condemning the violence.

26:22.232 --> 26:23.712
We'’re looking for
direct intervention.

26:23.843 --> 26:26.019
Filter for keywords
inciting violence

26:26.149 --> 26:27.237
or engaging
in hate speech,

26:27.368 --> 26:29.979
block those posts
and hand over the IDs

26:30.110 --> 26:32.503
to the Department of National
Intelligence for tracking.

26:32.634 --> 26:34.027
Sounds a lot like
the U.S. government

26:34.157 --> 26:36.464
forcing me
into censorship.

26:36.595 --> 26:39.032
See, to me it sounds
like a private company

26:39.162 --> 26:42.557
safeguarding the accuracy
of your users'’ experience

26:42.688 --> 26:44.298
to protect
against liability.

26:44.428 --> 26:46.648
Except that under the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act,

26:46.779 --> 26:49.346
we are not liable for the
content that our users create.

26:49.477 --> 26:51.435
In fact, if I get involved in
monitoring and shaping content,

26:51.566 --> 26:52.959
I could become liable
for the content that...

26:53.089 --> 26:54.525
The U.S. government
will protect you from.

26:54.656 --> 26:58.051
So really it comes
down to you, Scott.

26:58.181 --> 27:00.488
I ask you,
is this the kind of

27:00.619 --> 27:03.534
party you want
to be hosting?

27:03.665 --> 27:04.927
Because Congress
can start getting

27:05.058 --> 27:08.017
very interested
in your overseas expansion.

27:08.148 --> 27:11.934
Yeah, okay, Mr. Heat Miser.

27:12.065 --> 27:14.197
So,

27:14.328 --> 27:17.374
in the holiday spirit,

27:17.505 --> 27:19.855
what'’s in it for me?

27:21.944 --> 27:23.337
And I pushed
the tree lighting

27:23.467 --> 27:25.382
and holiday
remarks to 5:00.
Great.

27:25.513 --> 27:28.516
Push it to tomorrow.
Breakthrough with Kronic DM.

27:28.647 --> 27:31.780
Oh, good. Scott Goodman
was cooperative?

27:31.911 --> 27:35.001
With some mild coercion.
He gave us the ISPs on the, uh,

27:35.131 --> 27:37.525
fake news postings
and DNI tracked them all

27:37.656 --> 27:39.483
to a Russian-controlled troll
farm in the Crimean Peninsula.

27:39.614 --> 27:41.529
Well, that was fast.CYBERCOM is putting together

27:41.660 --> 27:43.226
some offensive
options right now.

27:43.357 --> 27:45.228
As in nownow?

27:45.359 --> 27:48.492
You want to go take out
a troll farm?

27:55.891 --> 27:57.588
[synth-pop music playing]

28:32.188 --> 28:35.583
[alarm blaring]

28:43.634 --> 28:45.549
ELIZABETH:
Did we get everything?

28:45.680 --> 28:48.988
I'’m getting
confirmation.

28:49.118 --> 28:50.641
We successfully
uploaded the servers

28:50.772 --> 28:52.600
before we
destroyed them.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.167
Excuse me, sir, they'’re
all out of commission?

28:54.297 --> 28:55.646
Completely.

28:55.777 --> 28:58.867
All right, let'’s get
all those faces.

28:58.998 --> 29:01.478
Scrape them for ID and
get them out to Interpol.

29:01.609 --> 29:04.481
State would like access to that
data as well, Ephraim, okay?

29:04.612 --> 29:07.093
Of course.Thank you.

29:07.223 --> 29:09.965
Let'’s see Russia
try to deny it now.

29:19.845 --> 29:22.804
Madam Secretary. You'’ve called
to wish me happy holidays?

29:22.935 --> 29:25.241
ELIZABETH [on video]: Well,
as we say here, Konstantin,

29:25.372 --> 29:27.374
I'’m going to cut
to the chase,

29:27.504 --> 29:31.117
or in this case,
the capture.

29:31.247 --> 29:34.250
At 9:42 Moscow
Standard Time,

29:34.381 --> 29:37.079
U.S. intelligence
documented

29:37.210 --> 29:39.081
these Russian nationals
operating what,

29:39.212 --> 29:41.867
in internet-speak,
is called a "troll farm."

29:41.997 --> 29:45.131
The data seized
from these servers

29:45.261 --> 29:46.828
indicates something
more serious.

29:46.959 --> 29:50.353
This was a highly organized,

29:50.484 --> 29:52.486
state-mandated
propaganda factory

29:52.616 --> 29:55.402
whose aim was
to destabilize and prevent

29:55.532 --> 29:58.709
the admission of Serbia
and Kosovo to NATO.

29:58.840 --> 30:01.974
Once again, you'’ve called
with outrageous allegations

30:02.104 --> 30:03.671
based on paranoid rumors...

30:03.802 --> 30:04.933
JAY: Foreign Minister,
I'’m sending you copies

30:05.064 --> 30:06.805
of the seized activity
from the servers.

30:06.935 --> 30:08.632
I think you'’ll find it
to be ample proof

30:08.763 --> 30:10.721
that members of your government
are engaged in a campaign

30:10.852 --> 30:11.810
of disinformation.

30:13.202 --> 30:14.813
Anti-Muslim stories
circulated online in France.

30:14.943 --> 30:17.598
False rumors of a violent
Catalonian uprising in Spain.

30:17.728 --> 30:19.948
I-In Spain, and a fake story
of a mass grave in Kosovo,

30:20.079 --> 30:21.080
and, worst of all,

30:21.210 --> 30:22.646
incitements to violence

30:22.777 --> 30:24.910
against Serbian citizens
of Northern Kosovo.

30:25.040 --> 30:28.739
Even if you have what you
consider to be proof of this,

30:28.870 --> 30:32.134
it'’s impossible
to trace a direct line

30:32.265 --> 30:35.616
from online rumors
to acts of violence,

30:35.746 --> 30:38.749
unless you intend
to blame Russia

30:38.880 --> 30:42.579
for the centuries of hatred
between Serbians and Albanians.

30:42.710 --> 30:44.712
I'’m sure you'll try.

30:47.367 --> 30:50.761
This is a 12-year-old boy.

30:50.892 --> 30:52.894
He was accused online
of stealing his friend'’s bike.

30:53.025 --> 30:57.203
A mob showed up at his door
and shot him in the head.

30:57.333 --> 30:59.422
If nothing had been posted
about this boy, Konstantin,

30:59.553 --> 31:01.642
he'’d be asleep
in his own bed right now,

31:01.772 --> 31:03.426
not in a morgue
waiting to be buried.

31:05.167 --> 31:07.866
I will look at your materials.

31:07.996 --> 31:11.913
But I would suggest:
look for someone else to blame

31:12.044 --> 31:15.134
every time a deal of yours
doesn'’t work out.

31:24.012 --> 31:25.971
Whoa.

31:26.101 --> 31:28.364
Sorry. Just clearing my head.

31:28.495 --> 31:30.627
Is it helping?

31:30.758 --> 31:31.977
Not really.
Huh.

31:32.107 --> 31:35.458
Do you have a minute?Shoot.

31:35.589 --> 31:38.113
Oceans and Environmental
and Scientific Affairs

31:38.244 --> 31:39.767
are refusing to
share their budget

31:39.898 --> 31:42.726
with Global Health Diplomacy'’s
anti-malaria initiative

31:42.857 --> 31:46.295
unless GHD comes up with some
alternative to the mosquito nets

31:46.426 --> 31:48.950
that OES says are
poisoning the environment.

31:49.081 --> 31:51.344
Okay.Yeah-- Reasonable, right?

31:51.474 --> 31:53.955
But when I took OES'’s
objection to GHD,

31:54.086 --> 31:56.262
they flatly refused
to alter their program,

31:56.392 --> 31:58.873
which, admittedly, is, uh,
you know, very effective.

31:59.004 --> 32:00.962
And you just want to get
your form stamped.

32:01.093 --> 32:02.529
No, I actually want to
get the two of them

32:02.659 --> 32:04.400
to work with each
other on the thing

32:04.531 --> 32:05.358
that they'’re supposed
to be doing--

32:06.620 --> 32:08.491
How is this condiment
drawer such a mess?

32:08.622 --> 32:10.493
She'’s been here two days.

32:10.624 --> 32:14.541
Sounds like your basic
territorial dispute.

32:14.671 --> 32:16.543
Everybody'’s thinking
with their lizard brain,

32:16.673 --> 32:18.937
so you'’re not gonna
get anywhere with logic.

32:19.067 --> 32:22.157
So what am I supposed to do?

32:22.288 --> 32:24.203
You got to think

32:24.333 --> 32:28.859
of OES and GHD like two bucks
roaring across the field

32:28.990 --> 32:30.165
at the beginning
of mating season.

32:30.296 --> 32:31.993
Wait for them
to lock horns

32:32.124 --> 32:34.474
until one of them
slinks away in defeat?

32:34.604 --> 32:37.259
If you had time,
which you don'’t.
I don'’t.

32:37.390 --> 32:39.261
So...

32:39.392 --> 32:43.048
let'’s think about this
on their level.

32:45.441 --> 32:47.095
W-What would make--

32:47.226 --> 32:51.621
what could--
make you forget about

32:51.752 --> 32:54.102
reorganizing condiment drawers

32:54.233 --> 32:57.453
and just let Nina do her thing?

33:04.895 --> 33:07.637
Thanks for coming
to myturf, everybody.

33:07.768 --> 33:10.814
Uh, just wanted to thank
both of your departments

33:10.945 --> 33:13.121
for the great work you'’ve done
on the anti-malaria initiative.

33:13.252 --> 33:15.515
I know the Department
of Defense will

33:15.645 --> 33:18.126
benefit greatly from the
groundwork you'’ve already laid,

33:18.257 --> 33:20.433
knowing that...Whoa, whoa, whoa.
DoD'’s taking over?

33:20.563 --> 33:22.087
Wha-- Yeah, we didn'’t
hear any of this.

33:22.217 --> 33:23.392
Oh, it just came down
the pipeline.

33:23.523 --> 33:24.785
Uh, knowing how squeezed
your budgets are,

33:26.482 --> 33:26.526
I knew you'’d be relieved to hear
that we'’re turning it over.

33:26.656 --> 33:27.744
Are you kidding?

33:27.875 --> 33:28.832
That'’s not a relief.Not at all.

33:30.225 --> 33:30.834
You don'’t let Defense
do the work of State, Blake.

33:30.965 --> 33:32.053
That'’s like...It'’s just like letting

33:32.184 --> 33:34.012
a cranky toddler land a plane.

33:34.142 --> 33:35.361
Or asking the
fox, "Oh, hey,

33:35.491 --> 33:37.015
do you mind gathering
up the eggs for me?"

33:37.145 --> 33:39.234
You should have come to us.What were you thinking?

33:39.365 --> 33:41.454
Well, gosh, I-I didn'’t realize
you'’d react this way.

33:41.584 --> 33:44.065
I-I... I guess I'’m still
learning the ropes.

33:44.196 --> 33:46.502
Is it too late?
Can we get it back?When was this confirmed?

33:46.633 --> 33:48.765
At this point, it'’s just
an exchange of e-mails.

33:48.896 --> 33:51.072
Oh, you can unravel that.Just tell them you
made a mistake.

33:51.203 --> 33:54.075
Well, there'’s-there's still the
matter of your budget dispute,

33:54.206 --> 33:55.729
so I don'’t, you know...

33:55.859 --> 33:57.296
Please. All I need to do is
reach out to the chem company,

33:57.426 --> 33:58.601
ask for some untreated nets.

34:00.212 --> 34:00.690
Get them in a different color,
maybe. That was Blake'’s idea.

34:00.821 --> 34:01.648
I love that idea.

34:02.910 --> 34:04.912
Maybe we share the public
education line item?

34:05.043 --> 34:07.262
We can look into that.

34:10.309 --> 34:14.835
Here you are. One antimalarial
funding recommendation,

34:14.965 --> 34:16.097
two stamps.

34:16.228 --> 34:18.882
Hey, you wrangled it. Nice work.

34:19.013 --> 34:21.102
You might even say "cool beans."

34:21.233 --> 34:24.410
[laughs][phone ringing]

34:24.540 --> 34:27.282
Secretary McCord'’s
office. Uh-huh.

34:27.413 --> 34:29.110
[quietly]:
Okay.

34:29.241 --> 34:33.332
Yeah, I mentioned that Ali had
a cough that wouldn'’t go away

34:33.462 --> 34:37.118
and Dr. Reese
offered some antibiotics.

34:37.249 --> 34:39.729
He was implying he has
something to hold over me.

34:39.860 --> 34:44.169
To do what, expose
our overuse of antibiotics?

34:44.299 --> 34:46.954
To say we bent the rules
on dispensing medication

34:47.085 --> 34:48.347
without a prescription, too,

34:48.477 --> 34:50.088
in case I try to blow
the whistle on him.

34:50.218 --> 34:52.699
I wouldn'’t be surprised if he
ambushes me at this meeting

34:52.829 --> 34:55.180
with Russell tomorrow.I can'’t take another turf war.

34:55.310 --> 34:56.833
I just can'’t.Come on. Let'’s get
you something to eat.

34:56.964 --> 34:58.792
I'’m not hungry.Ali made pesto.

34:58.922 --> 35:02.491
Maybe a little.

35:02.622 --> 35:07.975
Avdonin said this thing that
I can'’t stop thinking about.

35:08.106 --> 35:11.718
Even if Russia was...
I don'’t know,

35:11.848 --> 35:13.285
if they created the fake news--

35:13.415 --> 35:17.027
which they still
won'’t admit to--

35:17.158 --> 35:20.030
he says they can'’t
be held responsible

35:20.161 --> 35:22.250
for the violence caused by it

35:22.381 --> 35:26.907
because it'’s the hate that gave
it fuel in the first place.

35:27.037 --> 35:30.128
Classic deflection
of culpability.

35:30.258 --> 35:32.652
Yeah, but it got me thinking:

35:32.782 --> 35:36.612
has there ever been
a sectarian conflict

35:36.743 --> 35:38.048
that was
resolved peacefully?

35:38.179 --> 35:40.268
In all of human history?

35:40.399 --> 35:42.444
Well, England and France tried
to obliterate each other

35:42.575 --> 35:43.880
for a hundred years.

35:44.011 --> 35:46.666
And now London bankers
retire peacefully

35:46.796 --> 35:48.102
to Provence...Honey, I don'’t have

35:48.233 --> 35:49.712
a hundred years....no one thinks
anything about it.

35:49.843 --> 35:51.279
If you'’re talking
about Serbia and Kosovo,

35:51.410 --> 35:53.368
they'’ve been going at it
since the Ottoman Empire.

35:53.499 --> 35:57.155
And now it'’s about to flare up
into a whole new conflict

35:57.285 --> 36:00.201
over this Russian fake news.

36:00.332 --> 36:02.464
There'’s always
the other way.

36:02.595 --> 36:03.900
The Incas were about
to destroy themselves

36:04.031 --> 36:05.467
in a civil war
between two brothers.

36:05.598 --> 36:07.165
What stopped them?

36:07.295 --> 36:09.428
Spain.

36:09.558 --> 36:11.386
[microwave beeping]

36:23.833 --> 36:26.619
Oh, hey, Gordon, Adele.

36:26.749 --> 36:27.750
Good morning.

36:31.972 --> 36:34.279
He'’s just finishing up.

36:40.372 --> 36:43.679
All yours.

36:43.810 --> 36:46.116
Gentlemen.

36:46.247 --> 36:48.423
RUSSELL: Based on my review
of the incident

36:48.554 --> 36:52.514
and the circumstances
leading up to it,

36:52.645 --> 36:55.822
I'’ll be asking Dr. Reese to
tender his resignation today.

36:55.952 --> 37:01.044
Russell, I-I object
in the strongest terms possible.

37:01.175 --> 37:02.872
I-I'’ve worked
with Dan Reese for decades.

37:03.003 --> 37:04.483
He'’s a man of honor
and integrity.

37:04.613 --> 37:09.227
And as I made clear to Henry,
this was my responsibility.

37:09.357 --> 37:11.446
Thank you.

37:11.577 --> 37:14.101
Henry, do you want
to revise any of the facts

37:14.232 --> 37:16.059
in your report?

37:18.236 --> 37:20.412
No, but I-I...

37:20.542 --> 37:21.804
All right, well, then,
this matter'’s concluded.

37:21.935 --> 37:23.328
Thanks for your input, Gordon.

37:23.458 --> 37:24.938
Henry, if you could
stay behind a moment?

37:34.469 --> 37:37.429
I find it best
to include the opposition

37:37.559 --> 37:39.996
when there'’s gonna
be a blast radius.

37:40.127 --> 37:41.824
I never meant to hang Reese.

37:41.955 --> 37:44.566
He wasn'’t following protocol on
dispensing medication to Gordon

37:44.697 --> 37:47.134
and you and who knows who else,

37:47.265 --> 37:48.875
and he'’s playing fast and loose
with the paperwork.

37:49.005 --> 37:51.312
End of story.

37:53.183 --> 37:54.924
What?

37:55.055 --> 37:57.013
I-I...
[sighs]

37:57.144 --> 38:00.626
I'’m just a little concerned
about developing a reputation

38:00.756 --> 38:03.629
as the guy who blows the whistle
and gets people axed.

38:03.759 --> 38:06.414
Well, there'’s only
one team around here.

38:06.545 --> 38:09.156
And now everyone
knows you'’re on it.

38:09.287 --> 38:10.853
And they better be, too.

38:16.511 --> 38:18.470
Thank you, Nina.
Welcome.

38:18.600 --> 38:20.341
Welcome to our
delegates from Serbia.

38:20.472 --> 38:23.257
Please enjoy one last
continental breakfast.

38:31.221 --> 38:34.181
Again, thank you both
for coming.

38:34.312 --> 38:37.576
You have our presentation
in both Albanian and Serbian,

38:37.706 --> 38:42.276
so I'’m just going
to freestyle it.

38:42.407 --> 38:45.584
My husband Henry is a scholar
and a history buff,

38:45.714 --> 38:49.022
and when I asked him
for examples of conflict

38:49.152 --> 38:54.680
over land and ideology that were
resolved without violence,

38:54.810 --> 38:57.813
he couldn'’t really
come up with much.

38:57.944 --> 39:00.338
The general model seems to be
to fight it out

39:00.468 --> 39:04.342
until one side
is either exhausted

39:04.472 --> 39:06.169
or annihilated by the other.

39:06.300 --> 39:08.433
The only thing that really seems
to shift this dynamic

39:08.563 --> 39:11.653
is the threat of a common enemy.

39:11.784 --> 39:14.656
To that end,

39:14.787 --> 39:18.051
this presentation
will lay out for you

39:18.181 --> 39:20.662
a highly organized campaign

39:20.793 --> 39:23.361
of disinformation waged against

39:23.491 --> 39:25.841
both your countries
and throughout Europe

39:25.972 --> 39:28.409
by the highest levels
of Russian government.

39:28.540 --> 39:32.848
It was targeted, researched

39:32.979 --> 39:37.113
and, as we now know,
all too effective.

39:41.204 --> 39:41.988
Thank you.Thank you.

39:42.118 --> 39:42.989
My pleasure...

39:45.383 --> 39:47.123
Good work in there, everyone.

39:47.254 --> 39:50.866
So, you think there'’s any hope
of reviving the NATO deal?

39:50.997 --> 39:53.260
As much as it always
kills me to say it,

39:53.391 --> 39:55.697
Russell Jackson might be right.

39:55.828 --> 39:57.351
I might have reached too far.

39:57.482 --> 39:59.135
We'’ll circle back to it.

39:59.266 --> 40:01.311
Yeah...That whole strategy
of uniting two factions

40:01.442 --> 40:03.836
against a common enemy
actually works.

40:03.966 --> 40:06.447
So I hear.

40:06.578 --> 40:08.188
Yeah, I heard
you did some good work

40:08.318 --> 40:09.102
on that anti-malaria program.

40:09.232 --> 40:12.235
Well, I mean, I tried.

40:12.366 --> 40:14.629
Unfortunately, the funding'’s
not gonna be renewed next year.

40:14.760 --> 40:17.327
What?Yeah, some tech billionaire NGO

40:17.458 --> 40:19.460
offered to take control of
the whole mosquito nets thing.

40:19.591 --> 40:21.288
They got tons of money, they'’ll
do a better job, anyway.

40:21.419 --> 40:22.855
Wait, I actually got them
to work together, though.

40:22.985 --> 40:25.074
I mean, they have-they have
really good ideas.

40:25.205 --> 40:26.511
Well, they'’ll pass them
on to the tech guys.

40:26.641 --> 40:28.817
So I did all that
for nothing?

40:28.948 --> 40:31.864
Three yards and a cloud of dust.
