00:37.545 --> 00:39.585
You must be Diana?

00:46.185 --> 00:47.505
Juliette!

00:48.425 --> 00:50.305
Hello, Matthew.

00:55.665 --> 00:57.465
Is Gerbert here, with you?

00:58.865 --> 01:01.065
I've left him.

01:02.265 --> 01:04.665
You abandoned me.

01:05.985 --> 01:09.665
And now you're mating with her!

01:12.585 --> 01:16.065
-If you hurt her...
-I have to know how she did it.

01:17.985 --> 01:19.785
Kiss her.

01:22.985 --> 01:25.505
Or I'll make her bleed.

01:32.625 --> 01:34.185
It's going to be all right.

01:39.145 --> 01:41.545
It's going to be alright.

01:54.585 --> 01:56.785
You like how she responds to you.

01:58.105 --> 02:00.343
Gerbert sired me,

02:00.345 --> 02:03.865
groomed me to be
the object of your desire.

02:06.305 --> 02:08.305
I had no value.

02:09.345 --> 02:10.785
I'm sorry.

02:26.705 --> 02:29.905
Your magic can't save him!

02:59.465 --> 03:00.905
Ok...

03:17.105 --> 03:20.023
I've searched for you my whole life.

03:20.025 --> 03:23.505
You're not gonna die.
Do you hear me?

03:26.225 --> 03:27.665
I won't let you.

03:33.185 --> 03:36.465
Maiden mother, crone, I call you.
Goddess, help me.

03:43.265 --> 03:47.143
I will do anything to save him.

03:47.145 --> 03:50.263
If I help you, there will be a price.

03:50.265 --> 03:52.265
I will give anything,

03:53.705 --> 03:55.505
anything that you want.

03:56.625 --> 04:00.663
Anything, just save him.

04:00.665 --> 04:03.065
Give him life.

04:10.145 --> 04:11.945
Matthew!

04:18.625 --> 04:19.945
Em!

04:26.385 --> 04:27.705
Marcus!

04:29.585 --> 04:31.463
Diana, you need to let me help him!

04:31.465 --> 04:34.505
Don't!
Get away from him!

04:44.905 --> 04:46.543
Don't!

04:46.545 --> 04:48.105
Drink.

04:49.185 --> 04:50.663
Drink.

04:50.665 --> 04:53.663
Your blood can't heal both
of his wounds. He's dying.

04:53.665 --> 04:55.145
Drink.

04:56.385 --> 04:59.303
Diana, you need to let him go.

04:59.305 --> 05:01.743
I will pay your price!
Whatever it is!

05:01.745 --> 05:03.745
Very well.

05:08.465 --> 05:12.305
-What would I taste like?
-Don't ever say that to me.

05:13.905 --> 05:16.743
It would take but a moment.
You wouldn't be able to stop me

05:16.745 --> 05:19.305
if I struck and I wouldn't be able
to stop myself.

05:23.665 --> 05:25.625
I'm safe with you.

05:29.625 --> 05:30.945
I love you.

05:39.185 --> 05:41.985
-What took you so long?
-I had to go to Oneida.

05:45.065 --> 05:47.223
Use the left arm, it's already open.

05:47.225 --> 05:51.905
It's useless. The tissue's full of your
saliva so it won't absorb anything.

06:01.865 --> 06:05.663
Right, there's gonna be a line
going into your right arm, Diana.

06:05.665 --> 06:08.065
You may feel a sharp scratch.

06:20.185 --> 06:23.665
-Any news of Juliette?
-Afraid not.

06:25.865 --> 06:28.225
Unlike her to run away.

06:36.025 --> 06:38.823
Have you heard anything
more about Matthew?

06:38.825 --> 06:42.785
-He's not at Sept-Tours.
-He's hiding with Diana Bishop.

06:44.025 --> 06:45.625
We must find them.

06:47.425 --> 06:49.225
Well. What?

06:50.865 --> 06:53.705
I have other news.
If I shared it with you,

06:54.945 --> 07:00.063
I'd be taking a certain risk which,
I hope you agree, deserves some

07:00.065 --> 07:01.865
reward?

07:04.265 --> 07:08.983
You've had enough handouts,
you greedy little shit.

07:08.985 --> 07:11.745
Tell me what you know.

07:17.265 --> 07:19.145
The stench of a frightened witch...

07:20.545 --> 07:22.305
How I love it.

07:36.465 --> 07:38.185
What did you do with Meridiana?

07:43.465 --> 07:44.785
I let her go.

07:46.105 --> 07:50.625
She'd been in thrall to you
for long enough.

07:51.665 --> 07:56.505
No-one should have to suffer
centuries of slavery.

08:00.785 --> 08:04.105
Is Diana Bishop as powerful as her?

08:05.705 --> 08:08.943
She may be more powerful.

08:08.945 --> 08:13.143
And you held me back from her.

08:13.145 --> 08:17.665
You let Matthew get his hands on her.

08:19.185 --> 08:21.025
I didn't want that to happen.

08:30.865 --> 08:33.705
She really did defeat you.

08:36.784 --> 08:38.265
Your power

08:39.745 --> 08:42.544
still hasn't returned.

08:44.505 --> 08:46.945
Baldwin's kept me here,

08:48.265 --> 08:50.545
because I'm dangerous to him.

08:53.065 --> 08:55.545
Don't you want to know why?

09:00.825 --> 09:04.025
What she did was
unspeakably courageous.

09:05.425 --> 09:09.143
-You might not have been able to stop.
-I know.

09:09.145 --> 09:11.545
She's certainly full of surprises.

09:12.665 --> 09:14.065
Witch fire.

09:15.345 --> 09:17.025
it wasn't in her DNA markers.

09:22.025 --> 09:26.263
-I'd like to do more tests on her.
-No. She's been through enough.

09:26.265 --> 09:29.343
Matthew, she's the most powerful witch
we've ever encountered.

09:29.345 --> 09:32.345
And she doesn't descend
from the ancient clans.

09:34.265 --> 09:37.823
If we were to trace
her genetic lineage,

09:37.825 --> 09:41.505
understand how powers we thought
were extinct have survived?

09:43.745 --> 09:47.225
Alright, alright, yes, I'll ask her.

10:08.585 --> 10:10.305
You craved me,

10:11.585 --> 10:13.545
all this time

10:14.665 --> 10:16.545
and you resisted.

10:21.065 --> 10:24.265
-Did you love her?
-Once.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.625
She was Gerbert's creature.

10:29.865 --> 10:32.503
He trained her

10:32.505 --> 10:35.825
to infiltrate my heart and my family.

10:37.985 --> 10:40.785
And I took her life.

10:41.985 --> 10:45.345
-You saved me.
-I don't regret it.

10:50.385 --> 10:52.903
We can't yet protect ourselves,

10:52.905 --> 10:58.503
and if Juliette could find us,
then Knox can, The Congregation can.

10:58.505 --> 11:02.343
We can't just sit here,
waiting for that to happen.

11:02.345 --> 11:03.665
Diana,

11:04.865 --> 11:06.705
what if we

11:08.785 --> 11:10.585
Time Walked?

11:13.665 --> 11:16.465
What if we hide somewhere, in time?

11:42.875 --> 11:45.113
Send out the order.

11:45.115 --> 11:49.395
The Congregation will convene to decide
the fate of Satu Jarvinen.

12:04.195 --> 12:08.273
In the divine name of the Goddess,
help to...

12:08.275 --> 12:09.753
Baldwin.

12:09.755 --> 12:12.435
Knox knows Satu Jarvinen is in Venice
and is demanding we convene.

12:13.675 --> 12:16.033
If the Congregation gets back together
it may be impossible

12:16.035 --> 12:17.833
to stop further investigation.

12:17.835 --> 12:19.313
You must stop them.

12:19.315 --> 12:22.875
Your time is running out!

12:57.595 --> 13:01.473
-What's this?
-It's a poppet.

13:01.475 --> 13:07.233
Witches use these to cast spells.
I've never seen one so old before.

13:07.235 --> 13:11.353
Didn't your ancestor, Bridget Bishop,
have a problem with one of those?

13:11.355 --> 13:14.995
Yeah, they used it as evidence
to convict her at Salem.

13:21.835 --> 13:24.755
What is this? An earring?

13:28.795 --> 13:30.593
It's Ysabeau's.

13:30.595 --> 13:34.193
My father, Philippe, gave that to her.
But she lost it hundreds of years ago.

13:34.195 --> 13:35.875
How on earth...

13:37.595 --> 13:41.075
What is this house trying to tell us?

14:21.235 --> 14:24.835
-Matthew will need this too.
-I'll be sure he gets it.

14:30.835 --> 14:33.435
Send him and Diana

14:35.035 --> 14:37.115
all our love.

14:38.715 --> 14:41.953
You could land in the middle of a war,
or an epidemic, or...

14:41.955 --> 14:46.393
But what's the alternative? When she
found the Book, she became a target.

14:46.395 --> 14:50.553
-What do you think, Diana?
-Well, it depends on where we go.

14:50.555 --> 14:55.513
Wherever it is, or whenever it is, I
should be able to learn about my magic.

14:55.515 --> 14:57.353
Agreed. Em, you explained
that to Time Walk,

14:57.355 --> 15:00.593
you need three objects
from a particular time and place.

15:00.595 --> 15:03.753
-That's what Stephen told me.
-I have items coming my past lives.

15:03.755 --> 15:07.553
But, the thing that really concerns me
right now, is once we arrive there,

15:07.555 --> 15:10.953
how do we return from the past?

15:10.955 --> 15:13.553
If it's a short way,
it's not that difficult.

15:13.555 --> 15:18.233
Stephen said the further you go back
into time, the harder it is to return.

15:18.235 --> 15:21.193
You're gonna need some powerful spells
for that.

15:21.195 --> 15:24.395
And that'll require proper training.

15:25.635 --> 15:27.395
Open your mind.

15:29.595 --> 15:30.955
Think about The Still Room.

15:32.555 --> 15:35.555
You have to want to be there
more than here.

15:37.195 --> 15:39.793
-Where will you be?
-Depends when you arrive.

15:39.795 --> 15:43.115
If it's before you left,
we'll be there. If not, we'll be here.

15:44.475 --> 15:47.313
It's time we take a big step
into the mysterious.

15:47.315 --> 15:50.595
Pick up one foot, we travel.

15:57.155 --> 16:00.235
Focus, Diana, focus!

16:10.675 --> 16:12.153
Why didn't it work?

16:12.155 --> 16:16.033
Honey, you're focusing way too much on
the details of the room.

16:16.035 --> 16:18.713
Honey, you need to think about Matthew.

16:18.715 --> 16:21.633
You want to be with him.

16:21.635 --> 16:25.195
Magic's in the heart not the mind.
Try again.

16:26.515 --> 16:27.835
Ok.

16:32.235 --> 16:35.595
-Matthew, relax.
-Relax...

16:36.875 --> 16:40.875
She could be stuck somewhere in time.
Then how would we get her back?

16:51.875 --> 16:55.355
-I did it!
-I knew you could.

16:59.155 --> 17:02.753
Beware the witch with the blood
of the lion and the wolf

17:02.755 --> 17:08.555
for with it, she shall destroy
the children of the night.

17:09.835 --> 17:12.795
I've been trying to decipher
that prophecy

17:13.875 --> 17:16.994
for longer than you can imagine.

17:19.075 --> 17:21.635
I thought it might be Satu but,

17:23.315 --> 17:25.194
the state of her,

17:26.595 --> 17:30.475
it must be Diana Bishop.

17:33.195 --> 17:34.673
What have you done with Satu?

17:34.675 --> 17:38.593
Domenico has her with Baldwin's
approval. It's a delaying tactic.

17:38.595 --> 17:43.593
Baldwin is protecting his brother
and the Bishop witch.

17:43.595 --> 17:45.955
-He's gone too far!
-I agree.

17:47.795 --> 17:51.035
And if we can prove it, we could remove
him from The Congregation.

17:54.075 --> 17:57.915
It would throw the de Clermonts
into chaos

17:58.955 --> 18:00.635
and give us the...

18:02.195 --> 18:04.195
...opportunity to find...

18:05.675 --> 18:06.995
...Diana.

18:10.635 --> 18:14.155
-Hamish.
-Hello, Matthew. Marcus, Miriam.

18:15.475 --> 18:18.473
-And you must be Diana.
-I've heard so much about you.

18:18.475 --> 18:20.473
Likewise.

18:20.475 --> 18:24.395
-I see you brought everything?
-Yes. And some added extras.

18:27.155 --> 18:31.635
They're daemons. I can vouch for them.
And they have something for Diana.

18:36.275 --> 18:38.393
I wanted to get to you earlier

18:38.395 --> 18:41.873
but we didn't know where you were
until Agatha told us.

18:41.875 --> 18:44.393
Agatha Wilson.
She's a daemon on The Congregation.

18:44.395 --> 18:47.713
-You have links to The Congregation?
-Agatha's trustworthy.

18:47.715 --> 18:50.475
-And we know that, how?
-Because she's my mother!

18:53.035 --> 18:56.753
This has been passed down
through the Norman family.

18:56.755 --> 18:59.553
My father told me, when the time comes,

18:59.555 --> 19:02.713
to give this
to the one who has need of it.

19:02.715 --> 19:06.393
-What is it?
-Diana. The Goddess of the hunt.

19:06.395 --> 19:08.873
It's a chess piece. The white queen.

19:08.875 --> 19:11.875
I lost that in a wager,
on All Souls Night,

19:13.195 --> 19:18.193
-a very long time ago.
-But how did it end up in my family?

19:18.195 --> 19:19.715
I have no idea.

19:20.875 --> 19:22.913
Soph, let's go.

19:22.915 --> 19:28.033
No. Nathaniel. Look at these people!
Vampires, witches and daemons,

19:28.035 --> 19:32.513
all together, under the same roof. If
we can't tell them, who can we tell?

19:32.515 --> 19:34.073
Tell them what?

19:34.075 --> 19:36.075
Soph, stop.

19:37.875 --> 19:40.355
My parents were witches.

19:42.875 --> 19:45.075
Cross species?

19:47.195 --> 19:49.155
But that's impossible.

19:54.755 --> 19:58.633
Just to let you know, the house has
a mind of its own, so don't be scared.

19:58.635 --> 20:00.915
You're gonna try it up here.

20:04.515 --> 20:07.833
If The Congregation finds out about
Sophie's family history,

20:07.835 --> 20:09.435
she'll be in trouble.

20:11.595 --> 20:13.195
All I know for sure is that

20:14.435 --> 20:19.953
that chess piece was in the same place
as this, on the same night.

20:19.955 --> 20:22.553
Witches always say there's not much
keeping the living from the dead

20:22.555 --> 20:25.233
between Halloween and All Souls.

20:25.235 --> 20:29.475
I don't know, maybe,
maybe it might help us to Time Walk.

20:30.555 --> 20:34.115
All Hallows Eve is in six days.
Will you be ready?

20:35.155 --> 20:37.155
We'll have to be.

20:46.998 --> 20:52.638
-How many do we need?
-Usually, two, for the porch.

20:52.640 --> 20:56.358
But this is great.
We can put them up the driveway.

20:56.360 --> 20:59.198
The problem is, those rules haven't
changed since their establishment.

20:59.200 --> 21:01.398
-During the Crusades...
-That's what I mean.

21:01.400 --> 21:05.558
The Congregation are using ancient
texts to corroborate modern prejudices.

21:05.560 --> 21:10.398
-Well, they're getting along.
-It's good he has someone to talk to.

21:10.400 --> 21:15.558
He wants to change the world,
but it's hard to do that on your own.

21:15.560 --> 21:18.160
And you, honey?
Who do you have to talk to?

21:19.400 --> 21:22.280
Me? Oh, I'm fine.

21:23.880 --> 21:27.798
I couldn't sleep last night. And
I heard you crying in the bathroom.

21:27.800 --> 21:29.600
Bad dreams?

21:30.800 --> 21:33.398
I don't want to worry Nat.

21:33.400 --> 21:35.000
Tell us.

21:37.280 --> 21:41.398
I'm in a room with my baby.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.878
There are footsteps outside.

21:43.880 --> 21:47.880
I know The Congregation are coming
for me. I don't care about that,

21:49.200 --> 21:53.400
but I'm scared,
because they're coming for my baby too.

21:55.920 --> 21:57.878
Oh, honey.

21:57.880 --> 22:01.680
You're among witches now,
we'll do everything we possibly can.

22:05.800 --> 22:09.758
-How do you do that?
-Couple hundreds years' practice.

22:09.760 --> 22:13.440
-Do you want a go?
-I'll stick to computers.

22:16.360 --> 22:17.918
Hey. Mum.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.718
-Are you all right?
-Yeah. Everyone's good.

22:19.720 --> 22:24.358
There's three vampires here and three
witches, along with the three of us.

22:24.360 --> 22:27.718
-No one's killed anyone.
-Yet.

22:27.720 --> 22:29.518
Well, be careful.

22:29.520 --> 22:33.518
I'm heading back to Venice.
The Congregation's reconvening.

22:33.520 --> 22:37.280
Tell Diana to be careful. I love you.

22:42.080 --> 22:45.438
Am I really ready to take us back
twenty-five days?

22:45.440 --> 22:47.158
Well, we have to practice.

22:47.160 --> 22:50.960
If we can't do this, we don't stand
a chance crossing the centuries.

22:52.160 --> 22:56.038
And you're sure we're not going to bump
into our past selves?

22:56.040 --> 22:57.998
I think it's a different kind of past.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.798
You haven't bumped into your past self
whilst you've been Time Walking here.

23:01.800 --> 23:03.838
No.

23:03.840 --> 23:06.320
I guess we'll soon find out.

23:15.680 --> 23:17.000
Don't let go.

23:20.280 --> 23:21.760
Close your eyes.

23:23.400 --> 23:26.038
Now pick up your foot...

23:26.040 --> 23:28.640
When I tell you...

23:30.320 --> 23:31.800
Now.

23:44.280 --> 23:46.560
How do we know it's the right night?

23:49.320 --> 23:51.240
We don't.

24:02.480 --> 24:04.480
Well, don't you look lovely tonight,
Maman.

24:05.720 --> 24:08.438
No better than I did this morning.

24:08.440 --> 24:10.040
Shall we eat?

24:11.520 --> 24:12.840
Why not?

24:28.800 --> 24:31.240
Would you like to dance with me?

25:53.600 --> 25:54.920
I love you.

26:17.680 --> 26:21.160
I was present when Philippe set up
The Congregation.

26:22.360 --> 26:26.320
He weighed the scales in his favor.

26:27.840 --> 26:31.678
A de Clermont must be one of the nine
creatures who sit in the chamber.

26:31.680 --> 26:34.918
It's a problem
but it's not insurmountable.

26:34.920 --> 26:39.280
-Who would take the seat?
-After Baldwin and Matthew?

26:40.640 --> 26:45.118
Marcus, but we wouldn't have
any trouble with him.

26:45.120 --> 26:49.120
-Baldwin won't go easily.
-He'll put up a fight. But...

26:51.000 --> 26:52.320
We can match him.

27:00.240 --> 27:04.518
-He doesn't find it funny.
-So you said goodbye to Ysabeau?

27:04.520 --> 27:06.478
We did, yes.

27:06.480 --> 27:08.678
And we made it back
just in time for supper.

27:08.680 --> 27:12.480
Your last one, with us,
for a while anyway.

27:14.080 --> 27:15.678
Come on, Nat!

27:15.680 --> 27:18.398
No, I'm not letting you two anywhere
near my baby's DNA.

27:18.400 --> 27:20.678
Don't you want to know
if your child's a witch or a daemon?

27:20.680 --> 27:22.640
-I do!
-I think it's a great idea.

27:28.080 --> 27:29.800
I'd like to propose a toast:

27:33.120 --> 27:34.640
to unusual friendships.

27:35.640 --> 27:38.240
Unusual friendships!

27:41.160 --> 27:44.398
I presume you still want me
to be a Knight?

27:44.400 --> 27:48.158
Of course. It's because of you
the order runs so smoothly.

27:48.160 --> 27:51.638
But I am going to give up my post
as Grand Master.

27:51.640 --> 27:53.198
Matt, no!

27:53.200 --> 27:55.838
The brotherhood could do with
new energy.

27:55.840 --> 27:58.758
There was more than enough of it
around that table tonight.

27:58.760 --> 28:01.358
Almost a shadow Congregation.

28:01.360 --> 28:05.280
And if Sophie's claim to being
a cross species is true,

28:06.440 --> 28:08.438
then there'll be more like her
in need of protection.

28:08.440 --> 28:12.758
It might just be that the Knights
have to take on The Congregation.

28:12.760 --> 28:17.478
-Which is why you must lead us.
-I might not be able to.

28:17.480 --> 28:22.400
If Diana doesn't master the spells that
are required to leave the past, then

28:25.400 --> 28:27.400
we may never come back.

28:33.320 --> 28:35.560
Matthew's playing his cards
close to his chest.

28:37.400 --> 28:39.960
Don't you want to know
where you're going?

28:41.960 --> 28:43.360
No.

28:45.120 --> 28:47.158
No.

28:47.160 --> 28:49.118
I just,

28:49.120 --> 28:51.358
I want to be here,

28:51.360 --> 28:54.960
present,
for the time that we have left.

29:00.080 --> 29:04.080
Traveling back in time,
you'll be totally reliant on him.

29:06.160 --> 29:11.120
You do realize where you are going,
he won't be the same man?

29:18.760 --> 29:21.638
Baldwin has ordered Satu
to be put on trial.

29:21.640 --> 29:24.840
No matter what she's done,
we must stand united.

29:27.360 --> 29:30.838
-How are you?
-My power is coming back.

29:30.840 --> 29:34.400
Good. We may need it today.

30:00.760 --> 30:02.160
Nathaniel.

30:05.320 --> 30:09.678
If you become at all concerned,
when you're home,

30:09.680 --> 30:11.440
take Sophie here.

30:12.680 --> 30:17.158
-France?
-My mother's expecting you.

30:17.160 --> 30:22.278
Sarah and Em will be there. I don't
want them here when Congregation calls.

30:22.280 --> 30:25.238
You do understand we have
a hell of a fight ahead of us?

30:25.240 --> 30:27.360
I've been fighting all my life.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.600
Good luck.

30:35.560 --> 30:38.118
Thank you for bringing me the statue.

30:38.120 --> 30:42.918
I'm glad that I did and that I met you.

30:42.920 --> 30:45.600
-It feels like it'll be important.
-Yeah.

30:50.200 --> 30:52.158
What about the Book of Life?

30:52.160 --> 30:54.878
When you're away, the witches could
get their hands on it.

30:54.880 --> 30:58.678
Well, in the present, the book
isn't whole. Pages are missing.

30:58.680 --> 31:02.680
But, where we're going,
we might find it in its entirety.

31:03.840 --> 31:07.280
-Think of that.
-Come back and bring it with you.

31:09.080 --> 31:11.680
-Goodbye, my friend.
-Bye.

31:17.040 --> 31:20.518
You abducted Diana Bishop against
the permission of this chamber.

31:20.520 --> 31:22.878
-Do you deny this?
-No.

31:22.880 --> 31:26.078
You will therefore be stripped of your
status as a Congregation member.

31:26.080 --> 31:28.878
The witches will decide the punishment
you deserve.

31:28.880 --> 31:31.438
They will also need to
nominate a new member.

31:31.440 --> 31:34.558
Until then, this Chamber is adjourned.

31:34.560 --> 31:38.720
I believed you were working with your
brother to keep Diana from us.

31:43.040 --> 31:44.520
And I was proven right.

31:45.920 --> 31:50.120
-Keep her under control, Peter.
-I'd like to hear what she has to say.

31:56.160 --> 31:58.638
How were you proven right?

31:58.640 --> 32:02.598
I took the witch somewhere
we'd be safe,

32:02.600 --> 32:06.798
but Matthew Clairmont followed us there
with his brother.

32:06.800 --> 32:08.518
He's helping them.

32:08.520 --> 32:11.558
Working against The Congregation
is a treasonous offense.

32:11.560 --> 32:15.238
One that I deny!
Your witch has no proof.

32:15.240 --> 32:19.438
And my brother has always been a thorn
in my side. Why would I help him?

32:19.440 --> 32:22.600
Has anyone in this chamber heard of
The Knights of Lazarus?

32:24.360 --> 32:28.078
The Knights run a parallel organization
since the covenant was signed.

32:28.080 --> 32:32.238
They were established by
Philippe de Clermont

32:32.240 --> 32:34.038
and his sons.

32:34.040 --> 32:37.278
The aim of the order is to further...

32:37.280 --> 32:40.718
-The vampire cause.
-The brotherhood is philanthropic.

32:40.720 --> 32:42.838
We protect those
who can't protect themselves.

32:42.840 --> 32:44.998
Like Diana Bishop?

32:45.000 --> 32:49.758
You are a Knight of Lazarus and your
brother is its Grand Master, right?

32:49.760 --> 32:52.478
He's ordered you to protect her,
hasn't he?

32:52.480 --> 32:54.358
-No.
-Your heart is beating

32:54.360 --> 33:00.798
at double its usual speed, Baldwin,
your pupils are dilated.

33:00.800 --> 33:02.918
You're lying.

33:02.920 --> 33:05.918
-What's your brother done with her?
-Does she have the Book of Life?

33:05.920 --> 33:11.318
You want the Book and Diana Bishop for
yourself. This is a vampire conspiracy.

33:11.320 --> 33:14.318
I am as shocked as you, Peter,

33:14.320 --> 33:17.718
and to prove that I have no allegiance
with Baldwin,

33:17.720 --> 33:21.878
I demand that he step down from
The Congregation,

33:21.880 --> 33:23.478
with immediate effect.

33:23.480 --> 33:25.638
I have no intention of stepping down!

33:25.640 --> 33:29.560
-Then we must make you.
-We don't use force in this chamber!

33:40.880 --> 33:44.878
Baldwin de Clermont, you have committed
treason against The Congregation.

33:44.880 --> 33:47.278
Your punishment is death by beheading
and fire.

33:47.280 --> 33:50.918
That is a punishment suited for the
14th century, not the twenty-first!

33:50.920 --> 33:55.518
It comes from our ancient Testimony and
there is no newer one to replace it.

33:55.520 --> 33:58.878
There is one Congregation rule
we mustn't overlook!

33:58.880 --> 34:04.638
Each of us has one vote
on every decision in this chamber.

34:04.640 --> 34:09.158
-Does that include me?
-You're still on The Congregation.

34:09.159 --> 34:11.158
As am I.

34:11.159 --> 34:13.080
I also have a vote.

34:14.280 --> 34:18.638
-All those who accuse Baldwin of...
-Wait!

34:18.639 --> 34:22.518
Unlike the vampires,
daemons give everyone a voice.

34:22.520 --> 34:25.838
We will recess
and discuss this further.

34:25.840 --> 34:27.280
Make it quick.

35:15.705 --> 35:20.705
All those who accuse Baldwin of
treason, raise their left hands.

35:33.505 --> 35:34.865
Domenico?

35:40.265 --> 35:41.585
All those against...

35:47.945 --> 35:49.425
The motion is dismissed.

35:50.625 --> 35:55.025
You kept your head on your shoulders
for now. But you will tell us.

35:56.585 --> 36:00.345
Where are Matthew Clairmont
and Diana Bishop?

36:11.265 --> 36:13.905
You'll be hearing from me.

36:24.825 --> 36:26.145
Thank you.

36:27.705 --> 36:33.105
I had my reasons to want to protect
Diana Bishop. But you owe us a debt.

36:46.290 --> 36:47.132
Oh, before I forget.

36:47.134 --> 36:50.103
There's a card with the numbers to get
in contact with my mother.

36:50.105 --> 36:53.063
I never thought I'd be staying under
Ysabeau de Clermont's roof.

36:53.065 --> 36:58.303
A diet of nuts and berries,
at least we'll lose weight, right?

36:58.305 --> 36:59.625
Diana.

37:03.505 --> 37:06.103
I love you.

37:06.105 --> 37:09.265
-Goodbye, Em.
-Goodbye my darling.

37:12.225 --> 37:14.743
-Take care, you.
-Yeah, you too.

37:14.745 --> 37:16.545
Yes, I will.

37:23.465 --> 37:27.663
Listen to your teachers.
Absorb all the knowledge you can.

37:27.665 --> 37:29.305
Yeah.

37:32.025 --> 37:36.903
You have more talent than any witch
could ever dream of possessing.

37:36.905 --> 37:41.863
And I am so glad
you're not going to waste it.

37:41.865 --> 37:45.065
Thank you. I won't let you down.

37:48.225 --> 37:49.865
Stay safe.

37:55.945 --> 37:57.265
Good luck.

38:14.545 --> 38:16.545
Right. All done.

38:17.715 --> 38:19.995
We'll continue our research
while Matthew's away.

38:21.275 --> 38:22.873
Thank you.

38:22.875 --> 38:26.153
You're leaving now?
Not staying for Halloween?

38:26.155 --> 38:29.155
We thought you two should
have some time here alone.

38:30.515 --> 38:34.195
And as you know, I hate goodbyes.

38:40.755 --> 38:42.595
I'll see you outside, Marcus.

38:56.115 --> 38:57.835
So...

39:02.115 --> 39:04.115
I have something for you.

39:15.195 --> 39:16.515
Open it.

39:28.515 --> 39:32.473
Grand Master
of The Knights of Lazarus?

39:32.475 --> 39:34.753
I can't do this.

39:34.755 --> 39:38.033
-I don't want to.
-You think I did?

39:38.035 --> 39:41.873
But Philippe wanted to keep The
Congregation and the Knights separate.

39:41.875 --> 39:43.833
So he made me promise him

39:43.835 --> 39:48.873
that the brotherhood would never be run
by Baldwin.

39:48.875 --> 39:51.033
And I'm asking you to do the same.

39:51.035 --> 39:54.473
-I can't follow in your footsteps.
-My son...

39:54.475 --> 39:57.955
You are the only one
that I trust to do the job.

40:17.755 --> 40:20.275
I am at your command, Lord.

40:54.395 --> 40:56.395
It's time...

41:20.115 --> 41:23.993
In the suitcase of clothes
your mother added this.

41:23.995 --> 41:28.475
It's engraved.
"A ma vie de coeur entier".

41:29.875 --> 41:32.955
My whole heart for my whole life.

41:39.155 --> 41:42.553
Please leave a message
and I'll get back to you...

41:42.555 --> 41:45.515
Your time's run out Matthew. Go now.

41:46.835 --> 41:50.673
They know where you are. Gerbert has
the witches so be prepared for magic.

41:50.675 --> 41:53.433
Be prepared for anything.

41:53.435 --> 41:55.915
I just hope I'm not too late!

41:59.195 --> 42:01.155
This should help us find our way.

42:06.435 --> 42:09.713
'Settle thy studies and begin,

42:09.715 --> 42:13.915
To sound the depth of that
thou wilt profess.'

42:15.115 --> 42:16.595
Doctor Faustus.

42:17.875 --> 42:21.355
-Christopher Marlowe?
-I remember the night he inscribed it.

42:22.915 --> 42:25.433
Kit was a close friend of mine,

42:25.435 --> 42:30.113
in a dangerous time when there were
very few creatures one could trust.

42:30.115 --> 42:33.875
It was to him I lost that chess piece
to, on a wager on All Souls Night.

42:44.595 --> 42:47.993
Every year, a group of us would meet
at the Old Lodge,

42:47.995 --> 42:51.033
for the Catholic holy days of
All Saints and All Souls.

42:51.035 --> 42:53.315
So, we're going to London?

42:55.395 --> 42:57.953
To 1590.

42:57.955 --> 43:02.673
Top room of the house. They're alone.
Matthew's slipping.

43:02.675 --> 43:05.595
There's some kind of spell on it.

43:12.795 --> 43:14.873
Now remember,

43:14.875 --> 43:18.075
do not let go, no matter what.

43:19.075 --> 43:20.835
Never.

43:25.195 --> 43:27.115
Lift up your foot.

43:28.715 --> 43:31.995
And now, put it down when I tell you.

43:34.395 --> 43:36.155
It's time.
