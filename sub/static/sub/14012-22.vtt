00:00.534 --> 00:05.070
<i>In the criminal justice system,</i>
<i> the People are represented</i>

00:05.072 --> 00:07.573
<i> by two separate yet equally</i>
<i> important groups:</i>

00:07.575 --> 00:09.508
<i> The police,</i>
<i> who investigate crime</i>

00:09.510 --> 00:12.344
<i> and the district attorneys,</i>
<i> who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:12.346 --> 00:14.546
<i> These are their stories.</i>

00:38.372 --> 00:41.240
Good morning, Mr. McFadden.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.323
Mr. McFadden?

01:06.500 --> 01:07.833
(<i> indistinct</i>
<i> radio transmissions</i> )

01:07.835 --> 01:10.202
MAN:
Give me another shot of that.

01:14.208 --> 01:17.443
So, Eduardo, what time
did you punch in?

01:17.445 --> 01:19.211
5:30.

01:19.213 --> 01:21.580
And you let him in when?

01:21.582 --> 01:26.085
No, no, Mr. McFadden's
always the first one here.

01:26.087 --> 01:28.220
I think 4:00
or something...

01:28.222 --> 01:30.222
and he has
his own key.

01:30.224 --> 01:32.291
CERRETA:
Mikey?

01:36.464 --> 01:37.429
Oh, wonderful.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.431
Taped trigger,
taped butt.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.233
Serial numbers filed?

01:41.235 --> 01:42.334
Sure.

01:42.336 --> 01:44.336
Of course.
Why should it be easy?

01:44.338 --> 01:46.338
The vic's wallet
and keys, Detective.

01:46.340 --> 01:48.340
He had over a grand
in 20's on him.

01:48.342 --> 01:50.342
Not a robbery.
Not an amateur.

01:50.344 --> 01:51.343
So it's a hit.

01:51.345 --> 01:52.511
Maybe the Mafia

01:52.513 --> 01:54.346
plays the stock market.

01:54.348 --> 01:55.681
McFadden let himself
in here every morning

01:55.683 --> 01:57.416
according to the porter.

01:57.418 --> 01:59.184
No security guard.

01:59.186 --> 02:01.520
No witnesses.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.657
Walter Fairlee, Detective.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.292
Anything I can
help you with?

02:07.294 --> 02:10.362
Why was Mr. McFadden here
at 4:00 in the morning?

02:10.364 --> 02:11.597
Checking the Daxie--

02:11.599 --> 02:13.632
that's the German
stock exchange.

02:13.634 --> 02:16.368
Marshall had a lot of
international interests.

02:16.370 --> 02:18.337
What about enemies?

02:18.339 --> 02:19.638
Ours is a competitive business.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.473
But everybody
loved him, right?

02:21.475 --> 02:24.243
Everybody... respected
what he accomplished.

02:24.245 --> 02:25.410
Which was?

02:25.412 --> 02:27.713
Which was overcoming
his humble beginnings

02:27.715 --> 02:31.383
and amassing a net worth
in the hundreds of millions.

02:31.385 --> 02:34.319
This is a terrible moment
for our company.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.288
(<i> stock exchange bell rings</i> )

02:36.290 --> 02:37.489
Excuse me.

02:37.491 --> 02:40.292
(<i> clamoring voices</i> )

02:42.263 --> 02:44.596
I guess
the moment's over.

02:48.636 --> 02:53.172
   Captioning sponsored by
   NBC/Universal

04:10.484 --> 04:11.483
Exactly what business

04:11.485 --> 04:13.452
was Mr. McFadden in?

04:13.454 --> 04:15.004
Like America,

04:15.005 --> 04:16.555
his business
<i> was</i> business.

04:16.557 --> 04:17.823
He bought companies.

04:17.825 --> 04:19.591
He sold companies.

04:19.593 --> 04:22.561
He was one of the only
mergers and acquisition experts

04:22.563 --> 04:24.496
to emerge from the '80s

04:24.498 --> 04:27.332
with his assets and reputation
still intact.

04:27.334 --> 04:30.035
Your boss had more degrees
than a thermometer.

04:30.037 --> 04:31.503
They're all honorary.

04:31.505 --> 04:33.605
Mr. McFadden
never finished high school.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.607
Has anyone notified the family?

04:35.609 --> 04:36.842
No one to call.

04:36.844 --> 04:39.278
His wife, Ann,

04:39.280 --> 04:41.280
passed away
six years ago.

04:41.282 --> 04:42.547
Cancer.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.717
Oh, Dwight Corcoran.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.552
A former ambassador
to England.

04:47.554 --> 04:50.622
Mr. McFadden had many friends
in high places.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.057
We'll need a list.

04:52.059 --> 04:53.625
Were any of them

04:53.627 --> 04:55.661
close to him?

04:55.663 --> 04:57.663
Mr. McFadden
was a private person.

04:57.665 --> 05:02.501
All I knew of his life
was what I read in the papers.

05:02.503 --> 05:04.636
"Marshall McFadden,
king of the takeover,

05:04.638 --> 05:06.638
"son of a Yorkshire
coal miner,

05:06.640 --> 05:08.774
strikes it rich
in the New World."

05:08.776 --> 05:10.876
He bought companies
like I buy six-packs.

05:10.878 --> 05:13.345
Only after
he recycled the waste

05:13.347 --> 05:16.481
it was worth more
than when he bought it.

05:16.483 --> 05:17.649
Net worth,
nine figures.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.118
Anything from ballistics?

05:20.119 --> 05:22.586
The bullet matches the .38
we found in the garbage.

05:22.589 --> 05:23.655
No prints.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.324
The FBI is running

05:25.326 --> 05:27.392
an argon scan on what's left of
the serial number.

05:27.394 --> 05:30.662
Takeover guys buy up a company,
spit out the pits.

05:30.664 --> 05:31.663
People get hurt.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.732
18 months ago, hostile takeover.

05:33.734 --> 05:36.635
McFadden acquires a company:
Evans & Black.

05:36.637 --> 05:39.938
When the smoke clears,
480 people are looking for work.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.873
A guy standing on
the assembly line--

05:41.875 --> 05:44.376
is it worth killing over?

05:44.378 --> 05:47.379
What about the guy sitting
in the executive crapper?

05:47.381 --> 05:48.931
After the takeover

05:48.932 --> 05:50.482
McFadden replaced
the entire board of directors.

05:50.484 --> 05:52.851
White collars
can get pretty dirty

05:52.853 --> 05:55.654
waiting on
the unemployment line.

05:55.656 --> 05:58.657
Old days, when I ran
the Brooklyn plant,

05:58.659 --> 06:02.761
I put in ten hours
a day, six days per.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.363
And now?

06:04.365 --> 06:05.630
McFadden closes the plant.

06:05.632 --> 06:07.766
Now it's mornings
at my quotron

06:07.768 --> 06:09.768
and afternoons
at the club.

06:09.770 --> 06:12.571
How much did he pay
for the company?

06:12.573 --> 06:14.706
Papers say around
$700 million.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.742
And he shuts it down?

06:16.744 --> 06:18.443
Evans & Black was worth 700.

06:18.445 --> 06:20.612
The Brooklyn plant was
the company's prodigal son.

06:20.614 --> 06:22.414
Hadn't shown a profit
in ten years.

06:22.416 --> 06:24.683
Some divisions get closed,
others sold.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.685
That's what takeover's
all about.

06:26.687 --> 06:28.420
Like a chop shop.

06:28.422 --> 06:29.588
These takeover guys--

06:29.590 --> 06:30.689
McFadden, Pickens--

06:30.691 --> 06:33.658
the press is giving them
a bad rap.

06:33.660 --> 06:36.595
They're calling them
sharks, barracudas.

06:36.597 --> 06:37.696
They're not?

06:37.698 --> 06:38.764
They're like angels.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.432
They trim the fat.

06:40.434 --> 06:42.968
Less waste, more profit.

06:42.970 --> 06:45.804
Correct me if I'm wrong,
Mr. Reynolds.

06:45.806 --> 06:47.806
After the takeover

06:47.808 --> 06:50.609
McFadden threw you
and the board out.

06:50.611 --> 06:53.678
Yes, but we landed very gently.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.782
Golden parachutes.

06:56.784 --> 07:00.752
I walked away
with close to seven mil.

07:00.754 --> 07:03.488
All thanks to McFadden, huh?

07:03.490 --> 07:06.825
They should carve his face
on a mountain.

07:09.763 --> 07:10.762
'90s Horatio Alger.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.465
Get canned,
walk away a rich man.

07:13.467 --> 07:15.617
High school physics.

07:15.618 --> 07:17.768
There is no such thing
as spontaneous generation.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.772
Reynolds and his cronies
are making money.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.441
It's coming
from somewhere.

07:22.443 --> 07:23.909
The guys at the bottom.

07:23.911 --> 07:26.912
My Uncle Sal--
40 years of sweat and ink

07:26.914 --> 07:28.780
at Pylon Printing
in Queens.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.783
The owner sells out to
a German corporation.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.852
Your Uncle Sal
is history.

07:33.854 --> 07:35.720
No medical,
no pension.

07:35.722 --> 07:37.489
He's 68 years old

07:37.491 --> 07:39.724
and all he's got
to show for it

07:39.726 --> 07:40.992
is purple fingernails.

07:40.994 --> 07:42.727
And no golden parachute.

07:42.729 --> 07:45.997
Let's go see what happened
to the working stiffs.

07:51.505 --> 07:53.238
FAIRLEE:
Excuse me.

07:53.240 --> 07:56.942
You can't confiscate documents
without a warrant.

07:56.944 --> 07:58.543
Why not?

07:58.545 --> 08:00.846
McFadden's the victim,
not the suspect.

08:00.848 --> 08:02.514
Of course, I just
thought...

08:02.516 --> 08:03.648
Don't think.

08:03.650 --> 08:04.783
Cooperate.

08:04.785 --> 08:05.851
Over there.

08:07.721 --> 08:09.688
Got to hand it to him.

08:09.690 --> 08:10.789
He made it

08:10.791 --> 08:13.024
but he wasn't afraid
to spend it.

08:13.026 --> 08:15.093
A real philanthropist.
On this Evans & Black deal

08:15.095 --> 08:17.562
his lawyers collected
close to two mil.

08:17.564 --> 08:18.930
Maybe they earned it.

08:18.932 --> 08:20.899
Listen to this.

08:20.901 --> 08:23.902
Memo from his attorneys
"RE: Brooklyn plant.

08:23.904 --> 08:27.539
"Collective bargaining
agreement with Local 8157

08:27.541 --> 08:28.773
"expires November 30.

08:28.775 --> 08:31.810
"It would therefore
be ill-advised

08:31.812 --> 08:33.111
"to cease operations

08:33.113 --> 08:35.981
prior to December 1."

08:35.983 --> 08:38.583
McFadden was closing
that Brooklyn plant

08:38.585 --> 08:39.818
from the get-go.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.753
Screw the union
with legal approval.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.722
His father worked
for the coal mines.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.290
You'd think he'd have
sympathy for the grunts.

08:45.292 --> 08:47.826
They sure had some for him.

08:47.828 --> 08:49.828
This is a letter
from the union

08:49.830 --> 08:54.766
agreeing to roll back
all the salaries by 15%.

08:54.768 --> 08:55.901
To McFadden?

08:55.903 --> 08:57.969
No, to the loan department

08:57.971 --> 09:00.772
at Bank of the Five Boroughs.

09:00.774 --> 09:04.709
"In order to induce the bank
to finance the acquisition

09:04.711 --> 09:07.846
"of Evans & Black, Inc.
by Marshall McFadden.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.581
"Signed: Edward Palmieri,

09:09.583 --> 09:11.950
president of Guild
of American Industrial Workers."

09:11.952 --> 09:14.786
He gets the union
to close the deal

09:14.788 --> 09:16.855
then bites them
on the butt?

09:16.857 --> 09:18.590
All's fair in M & A.

09:20.794 --> 09:24.095
That union letter--
who did you say signed it?

09:24.097 --> 09:25.764
Palmieri.

09:25.766 --> 09:29.100
Palmieri.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.902
Palmieri.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.939
Palmieri.

09:33.941 --> 09:36.741
Last month, a check
drawn on the account

09:36.743 --> 09:38.977
of Ann McFadden
Cancer Foundation,

09:38.979 --> 09:41.112
payable to Edward G. Palmieri

09:41.114 --> 09:43.982
in the amount of
100,000 smackeroos.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.751
Wow.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.620
Do you think this Palmieri

09:48.622 --> 09:50.822
moonlights as
a cancer specialist?

09:50.824 --> 09:54.659
McFadden gets the union
to agree to future rollbacks.

09:54.661 --> 09:56.661
Company looks
more profitable.

09:56.663 --> 09:58.363
More attractive
to the bank.
It's all kosher.

09:58.365 --> 10:01.866
Except McFadden never intended
to sign a new contract.

10:01.868 --> 10:03.902
He planned on
shutting down the plant

10:03.904 --> 10:05.870
when the union
contract expired.

10:05.872 --> 10:07.639
It was a con.

10:07.641 --> 10:09.774
And the union head
is running point.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.076
A mook named Palmieri
pocketed 100 g's

10:11.078 --> 10:13.878
from McFadden's
charitable foundation.

10:13.880 --> 10:14.980
Fellas, what's wrong
with this picture?

10:14.982 --> 10:17.115
McFadden is making Palmieri rich

10:17.117 --> 10:19.217
and he's gonna kill
the golden goose?

10:19.219 --> 10:21.987
This guy would
sell out the rank and file.

10:21.989 --> 10:23.989
It doesn't make him a killer.

10:23.991 --> 10:26.024
If the stakes
get high enough...

10:26.026 --> 10:27.993
LOGAN:
All right.

10:27.995 --> 10:31.896
Maybe there's a history
between McFadden and Palmieri.

10:31.898 --> 10:33.698
Unions keep records.

10:33.700 --> 10:35.800
A subpoena might help.

10:35.802 --> 10:41.139
Well, how does a subpoena
<i> duces tecum</i> sound?

10:41.141 --> 10:43.108
Means lay<i> your</i> cards

10:43.110 --> 10:46.645
on<i> our</i> table.

10:46.647 --> 10:49.414
You want documents,
you got documents.

10:49.416 --> 10:51.983
My client is merely satisfying

10:51.985 --> 10:52.951
the subpoena.

10:52.953 --> 10:54.853
We asked for documents

10:54.855 --> 10:57.856
relating to the union's
dealings with McFadden,

10:57.858 --> 10:59.724
not the "History
of the World,

10:59.726 --> 11:00.859
parts one and two."

11:00.861 --> 11:03.028
The<i> duces tecum</i> was specific.

11:03.030 --> 11:05.964
Duces my tuches. You want to
know something, you talk to me.

11:05.966 --> 11:09.100
Tell us about the agreement
to roll back union bennies

11:09.102 --> 11:10.969
when McFadden took over.

11:10.971 --> 11:13.071
The old owners lived
in the Dark Ages.

11:13.073 --> 11:17.075
They hold on, the Brooklyn plant
goes down the crapper.

11:17.077 --> 11:19.744
If the Brooklyn plant
goes Chapter 11,

11:19.746 --> 11:20.979
the union's
on the street.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.280
Where I come from

11:22.282 --> 11:24.149
something is better
than nothing.

11:24.151 --> 11:26.151
Eddie agreed
to the rollback.

11:26.153 --> 11:27.886
The bank likes the deal.

11:27.888 --> 11:29.020
Everybody's happy.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.923
Until the limey stabs us
in the back.

11:31.925 --> 11:33.024
Us?

11:33.026 --> 11:35.694
Looks like you did all right.

11:35.696 --> 11:38.163
Are you implying something?

11:38.165 --> 11:40.098
$100,000, payable

11:40.100 --> 11:42.967
to your client
from McFadden's foundation.

11:48.475 --> 11:51.242
Uh, that was for consulting.

11:51.244 --> 11:54.045
We don't really care
about the payment.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.047
What we're concerned with

11:56.049 --> 11:58.116
is why the payer
is dead.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.052
Wait a minute.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.787
You guys think that I...?

12:02.789 --> 12:05.190
My union's got 10,000 members.

12:05.192 --> 12:06.791
10,000members.

12:06.793 --> 12:08.193
The Brooklyn plant canned--
what?--

12:08.195 --> 12:09.794
a couple hundred?

12:09.796 --> 12:11.830
It's not even worth my time.

12:11.832 --> 12:14.499
Eddie, whose time is it worth?

12:14.501 --> 12:16.201
You charging me with something?

12:16.203 --> 12:19.971
CRAGEN:
No, no, we're not

12:19.973 --> 12:22.006
but maybe
the U.S. Attorney's Office

12:22.008 --> 12:24.342
would be interested in
those consulting fees.

12:32.285 --> 12:34.953
The boys who worked the plant--

12:34.955 --> 12:37.122
got a couple of hotheads there.

12:37.124 --> 12:39.290
Unemployment bennies
are running out--

12:39.292 --> 12:42.961
some of them
have nothing left to lose.

12:42.963 --> 12:46.164
Podosky, Dborkin,
Vilanis, and Black.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.038
MAN:
<i> ...the Department of Labor.</i>

12:54.040 --> 12:55.373
<i> My hands are tied.</i>

12:55.375 --> 12:56.875
Closed meeting, fellas.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.042
We won't go in.

12:58.044 --> 13:00.278
We'll just listen
at the doorway.

13:00.280 --> 13:03.181
about unemployment benefits.
There's nothing we can do

13:03.183 --> 13:05.183
Local 8157,
official business.

13:05.185 --> 13:07.051
Get lost.

13:07.053 --> 13:08.052
Shield 9215.

13:08.054 --> 13:09.287
Ditto.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.222
MAN:
<i> We are scheduled to meet</i>

13:11.224 --> 13:13.158
<i> with Department of Labor reps</i>

13:13.160 --> 13:15.160
of the month.
the first

13:15.162 --> 13:16.861
gentlemen.
Everything takes time,

13:16.863 --> 13:18.163
My recommendation is, therefore,

13:18.165 --> 13:21.099
to work with the Economic
Development Council

13:21.101 --> 13:23.301
and the state
insurance commissioner...

13:23.303 --> 13:25.136
The insurance
commissioner

13:25.138 --> 13:26.337
wouldn't know

13:26.339 --> 13:29.207
a tool-and-die maker
from a cheeseburger.

13:29.209 --> 13:30.975
(<i> laughing</i> )

13:30.977 --> 13:33.144
You want the floor, Simon?

13:33.146 --> 13:35.146
What happened
to our pension plan

13:35.148 --> 13:38.249
shouldn't ever, ever
have happened in this country!

13:38.251 --> 13:40.385
We paid into it
for 40 years, and now...

13:40.387 --> 13:42.086
that policy in your hand?

13:42.088 --> 13:45.089
You may as well wipe your arse
with it.

13:45.091 --> 13:46.191
It's useless!

13:46.192 --> 13:47.292
(<i> cheers of agreement</i> )

13:50.864 --> 13:53.264
Let's hear it
for the rank and file.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.200
politicians, managers,
We trusted

13:55.202 --> 13:59.070
and those clowns on 52nd Street
with their expensive suits

13:59.072 --> 14:01.206
that we paid for with our dues!

14:04.911 --> 14:09.180
to overthrow Palmieri, Simon.
We all know you want

14:09.182 --> 14:10.348
Overthrow nothing.

14:10.350 --> 14:13.017
How about throwing him
in the East River?

14:13.019 --> 14:14.219
That's right!

14:14.221 --> 14:16.120
You tell 'em!

14:27.534 --> 14:29.000
So, Mr. Vilanis,

14:29.002 --> 14:32.003
what happened
to your pension plan?

14:32.005 --> 14:34.873
Before McFadden
closed the plant

14:34.875 --> 14:38.877
he took our contributions,
invested them in junk bonds.

14:38.879 --> 14:40.595
With the market today,

14:40.596 --> 14:42.312
we're lucky to get
ten cents on the dollar.

14:42.315 --> 14:44.382
Were you serious,
back there,

14:44.384 --> 14:46.651
about dumping the union heads
in the river?

14:46.653 --> 14:48.637
Yeah, right.

14:48.638 --> 14:50.622
I shot McFadden
in the back, too.

14:50.624 --> 14:51.956
In the head.

14:51.958 --> 14:53.391
In the head!

14:53.393 --> 14:54.659
(<i> coughing</i> )

14:54.661 --> 14:56.961
I wish.

14:56.963 --> 14:58.396
Are you serious?

14:58.398 --> 15:00.031
At this point,
you're the best we have.

15:00.033 --> 15:01.633
You have
an alibi, Simon?

15:01.635 --> 15:04.068
I was drinking over at Nooch's
in Red Hook

15:04.070 --> 15:06.437
till closing time, probably.

15:06.439 --> 15:08.072
Same as most nights.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.974
Are you sure
about that?

15:09.976 --> 15:11.175
Either there,

15:11.177 --> 15:13.912
or St. Eligius Hospital
in Brooklyn.

15:13.914 --> 15:18.016
Every other Thursday's
party time at the clinic.

15:18.018 --> 15:20.051
Oh...

15:20.053 --> 15:22.420
here we go.

15:24.591 --> 15:27.358
The old owners,

15:27.360 --> 15:29.594
they got their ounce
of flesh,
definitely,

15:29.596 --> 15:34.098
but they also offered us
a 99-year lease

15:34.100 --> 15:36.167
at 150 per month.

15:36.169 --> 15:37.568
150 bucks?

15:37.570 --> 15:39.570
Those were the good old days.

15:39.572 --> 15:41.606
Then McFadden
and his bean counters

15:41.608 --> 15:43.374
got into the act.

15:43.376 --> 15:47.645
First thing they did
was discover $120 million

15:47.647 --> 15:50.181
in hidden assets-- i.e.,

15:50.183 --> 15:53.952
20 buildings just like that one.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.086
But you had a lease.

15:55.088 --> 15:57.088
99 years...

15:57.089 --> 15:59.089
<i> or</i> until there was no longer
an Evans plant

15:59.092 --> 16:00.191
in Brooklyn.

16:00.193 --> 16:01.459
He closes shop,

16:01.461 --> 16:03.695
he's got a lot of real estate.

16:03.697 --> 16:06.464
Up there, top floor.

16:06.466 --> 16:10.702
Only two bedrooms,
but we raised three kids

16:10.704 --> 16:13.404
and we got along somehow.

16:13.406 --> 16:19.544
Today, it's luxury condos
for the upwardly mobile exec.

16:19.546 --> 16:22.180
He just tossed
you people out, huh?

16:22.182 --> 16:24.215
Naturally,
we couldn't come up

16:24.217 --> 16:26.184
with the down payment.

16:26.186 --> 16:28.619
Now the economy's down the john.

16:28.621 --> 16:31.589
Even the yuppies
can't afford the luxury.

16:31.591 --> 16:36.027
The McFadddens of the world
leave a lot of wreckage behind.

16:36.029 --> 16:39.197
You don't know the half of it.

16:39.199 --> 16:40.999
Your doctor, Simon.

16:41.001 --> 16:42.700
My doctor?

16:42.702 --> 16:44.702
Dr. Bergman.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.704
You mind
if we talk to him?

16:46.706 --> 16:49.007
Her. Her!

16:49.009 --> 16:51.042
Go ahead.

16:51.044 --> 16:52.143
She's a laugh a minute.

16:52.145 --> 16:54.545
Alveolar carcinoma
of the right lung.

16:54.547 --> 16:56.014
CERRETA:
Which is?

16:56.016 --> 16:58.016
Consolidation
of the air spaces.

16:58.018 --> 17:00.084
It's a tumor--
lung cancer.

17:00.086 --> 17:02.520
Is that from
two packs a day?

17:02.522 --> 17:04.639
Could be.

17:04.640 --> 17:06.757
Could also be 30 years
of breathing in chemicals.

17:06.760 --> 17:08.159
The prognosis?

17:08.161 --> 17:11.095
Cough, profuse sputum,
often blood-streaked.

17:11.097 --> 17:14.499
Untreated, a patient
can survive up to nine months.

17:14.501 --> 17:16.768
With treatment,
the overall survival rate

17:16.770 --> 17:18.770
is still less
than ten percent.

17:18.772 --> 17:20.104
Damn.

17:20.106 --> 17:21.572
That's the good news.

17:21.574 --> 17:24.675
I doubt he can afford
the chemo much longer.

17:24.677 --> 17:26.811
But insurance
would cover it.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.279
If he had it.

17:28.281 --> 17:29.547
Excuse the pun,

17:29.549 --> 17:32.083
but his life savings
is saving his life--

17:32.085 --> 17:34.252
or prolonging it,
anyway--

17:34.254 --> 17:36.254
and he doesn't seem like a guy

17:36.256 --> 17:38.122
who rolls over CDs
for a living.

17:38.124 --> 17:40.191
Treatment's expensive.
How much longer can it last?

17:40.193 --> 17:42.627
Thursday night--
was he here?

17:42.629 --> 17:43.728
The man's prompt.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.563
Checked in at 8:00.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.298
CERRETA:
Out by 9:00?

17:47.300 --> 17:49.300
Does this look like Lenox Hill?

17:49.302 --> 17:51.202
This is a clinic,
Detective.

17:51.204 --> 17:52.603
First come,
first serve.

17:52.605 --> 17:53.771
Thursday was busy.

17:53.773 --> 17:57.175
I saw Mr. Vilanis at 11:30.

17:57.177 --> 18:00.545
So Vilanis left the clinic
at 12:30.

18:00.547 --> 18:04.282
He hops into a cab,
blows McFadden away at 5:00.

18:04.284 --> 18:05.550
What's the problem?

18:05.552 --> 18:07.285
The man is dying.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.554
Which means
he has nothing to lose.

18:09.556 --> 18:11.155
McFadden took his job,

18:11.157 --> 18:13.157
his money,
his house, his health.

18:13.159 --> 18:15.159
Sounds like McFadden
deserved it.

18:15.161 --> 18:17.161
Yeah, well, your guy Vilanis

18:17.163 --> 18:19.597
is not exactly
St. Thomas, either.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.632
Four months ago-- assault.

18:23.169 --> 18:27.305
Vilanis was arrested
for tossing an egg at McFadden.

18:27.307 --> 18:28.706
Charges were dropped, but...

18:28.708 --> 18:30.641
But what?
McFadden died

18:30.643 --> 18:32.310
of eggshells
in the brain?

18:32.312 --> 18:34.612
There's also
a weapons charge in Brooklyn.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.681
That was four years ago,
Donny.

18:36.683 --> 18:39.584
I think we're spinning our
wheels with Vilanis. We're
hassling this little guy

18:39.586 --> 18:43.688
while these rich yahoos
are laughing all the
way to the bank.

18:43.690 --> 18:45.656
Unless you got
something better,

18:45.658 --> 18:47.658
check out the charges
in Brooklyn,

18:47.660 --> 18:50.862
and if it's not too much trouble

18:50.864 --> 18:52.730
take Robin Hood
with you.

18:54.667 --> 18:59.570
Vilanis, Simon J.,
arrested 1988 for CPW Three.

18:59.572 --> 19:02.640
Knocked down
to prohibited use of a weapon.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.276
Judge gave him
a conditional discharge.

19:05.278 --> 19:08.646
It's an Easter Sunday tradition
with Greek Orthodoxes.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.682
A few ouzos and they're
taking shots at the moon.

19:11.684 --> 19:14.152
Not realizing
what goes up comes down.

19:14.154 --> 19:16.754
Stupid, but in this case,
a misdemeanor.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.656
He had a permit.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.758
Could I have
the serial number?

19:20.760 --> 19:22.660
Yeah.

19:22.662 --> 19:25.630
A-J-7,
3-9-9-2-1.

19:25.632 --> 19:28.666
Smith and Wesson,
.38 caliber.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.668
Thanks, Sarge.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.638
Now let's hope that Simon's
Smith and Wesson

19:33.640 --> 19:36.874
is in his bedside table
next to Gideon.

19:39.646 --> 19:41.913
I was half in the bag.

19:41.915 --> 19:43.648
But an egg...

19:43.650 --> 19:47.652
Well, it seemed like
a good idea at the time.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.654
A message to McFadden.

19:49.656 --> 19:52.390
You should have seen that egg...

19:52.392 --> 19:54.725
dripping down his face.

19:56.763 --> 19:59.864
(<i> deep, hacking cough</i> )

20:00.934 --> 20:04.802
You sure you want
to fire one of those up?

20:04.804 --> 20:07.205
This has nothing
to do with it.

20:07.207 --> 20:09.674
It's that damn air
in the plant.

20:09.676 --> 20:11.676
36 years.

20:11.678 --> 20:13.678
Maybe if you talked
to a lawyer...

20:13.680 --> 20:16.347
That's another part
of the conspiracy.

20:16.349 --> 20:19.650
That shyster on Madison,
he saw me coming.

20:19.652 --> 20:22.787
$5,000 nonrefundable retainer.

20:22.789 --> 20:24.789
"Case like this," he said,

20:24.791 --> 20:27.792
"must be worth ten million,
minimum."

20:27.794 --> 20:29.393
So I write him a check.

20:29.395 --> 20:30.761
And?

20:30.763 --> 20:33.297
The guy gets in a cab

20:33.299 --> 20:36.734
and goes out to the plant
with his expert.

20:36.736 --> 20:40.238
He comes back, he says to me,
"Sorry. No case."

20:40.240 --> 20:41.672
"Why?"

20:41.674 --> 20:44.242
"Because what you got
could have been caused

20:44.244 --> 20:46.777
just by breathing the air
in Brooklyn."

20:46.779 --> 20:47.979
That's it?

20:47.981 --> 20:52.817
He sent me a bill for the cab.

20:54.854 --> 20:56.721
Simon, your gun--

20:56.723 --> 20:59.857
do you mind if we
have a look at it?

20:59.859 --> 21:01.726
If you can find it.

21:01.728 --> 21:04.462
It disappeared
a couple of weeks ago.

21:04.464 --> 21:05.997
Thursday, the 23rd.

21:05.999 --> 21:08.299
My night to get chemo.

21:08.301 --> 21:10.501
And you reported it, I hope.

21:10.503 --> 21:12.987
Reported it?

21:12.988 --> 21:15.472
This is the third time
they broke into this dump.

21:15.475 --> 21:19.710
The first time they broke in,
they took my television set.

21:19.712 --> 21:22.513
The cops came out,
they said, "It's too bad."

21:22.515 --> 21:23.881
The next break-in,

21:23.883 --> 21:26.017
they took my
record player.

21:26.019 --> 21:28.019
The cops didn't even show up.

21:28.021 --> 21:29.720
The third time...

21:29.722 --> 21:33.557
go down to the station?
What do you say we

21:33.559 --> 21:35.026
Maybe somebody turned it in.

21:35.028 --> 21:36.427
Maybe you'll get lucky.

21:36.429 --> 21:38.763
Maybe I'll win the lottery.

21:38.765 --> 21:41.966
So we'll just go
have a little talk,

21:41.968 --> 21:44.502
with the super, okay?

21:50.877 --> 21:52.410
Detective Mike Logan.

21:52.412 --> 21:53.844
Sorry to bother you.

21:53.846 --> 21:55.579
Did you see
anybody suspicious

21:55.581 --> 21:57.848
hanging around
Mr. Vilanis's apartment

21:57.850 --> 21:59.750
two weeks ago Thursday?

21:59.752 --> 22:00.918
No.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.820
No? You're positive?

22:02.822 --> 22:05.606
Yeah.

22:05.607 --> 22:08.391
He never sees anything
till the first of the month.

22:08.394 --> 22:10.828
Then his eyesight improves.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.396
It's worth a shot

22:12.398 --> 22:15.399
but if he really
did kill McFadden

22:15.401 --> 22:18.936
you think he's going
to identify his own gun?

22:18.938 --> 22:20.838
He's an honorable man.
You never know.

22:20.840 --> 22:25.543
Right. He was George
Washington in a previous
life? Come on, Phil.

22:25.545 --> 22:26.811
We're up.

22:26.813 --> 22:28.946
I don't have to tell you.

22:28.948 --> 22:31.849
A lot of guys
are dying to talk.

22:31.851 --> 22:32.917
We'll see.

22:42.795 --> 22:45.096
Take your time.

22:50.503 --> 22:52.536
It looked like this.

22:52.538 --> 22:57.007
I don't know, but mine
never had any tape.

22:58.378 --> 23:01.379
Make sure, Simon, huh?

23:05.985 --> 23:08.119
He's not sure--
not yet.

23:08.121 --> 23:10.554
Yeah? Well,
maybe this will help.

23:10.556 --> 23:15.826
The FBI retrieved
six of the eight filed-
off serial numbers.

23:15.828 --> 23:17.094
It's his gun
for sure.

23:17.096 --> 23:20.831
You better tell your friend
to call a lawyer,

23:20.833 --> 23:23.901
and Phil, don't forget
to read him his rights.

23:25.438 --> 23:27.972
Usually,
I'm half in the bag.

23:27.974 --> 23:30.107
Oh, Simon...

23:30.109 --> 23:32.877
(<i> coughing</i> )

23:35.615 --> 23:37.948
JUDGE:
I'm getting behind here,
Counselor.

23:37.950 --> 23:41.752
Why does Mr. Vilanis
refuse to enter a plea?

23:41.754 --> 23:43.988
He wants
to represent himself.

23:43.990 --> 23:45.790
I hate<i> pro se</i> cases.

23:45.792 --> 23:49.126
Did he bring his own soapbox,
or does he expect the court

23:49.128 --> 23:51.295
to provide one?

23:51.296 --> 23:53.463
ROBINETTE:
The People
aren't thrilled.

23:53.466 --> 23:55.699
By the time he learns
the rules of procedure,

23:55.701 --> 23:56.867
we'll all have gray hair.

23:56.869 --> 23:58.202
Meaning what?

23:58.204 --> 23:59.770
He's stalling?

23:59.772 --> 24:01.105
Always a good tactic.

24:01.107 --> 24:03.641
Mr. Vilanis
can't afford to stall.

24:03.643 --> 24:05.743
He's dying
of lung cancer.

24:05.745 --> 24:07.878
I've read his file,
Miss Cantwell.

24:07.880 --> 24:16.754
I'm going to enter a not guilty
plea on the defendant's behalf.

24:16.756 --> 24:21.459
I'd appreciate it if you'd act
as the man's ad hoc advisor.

24:21.461 --> 24:25.162
Of course,
and I suggest ROR.

24:25.164 --> 24:28.466
The man needs chemotherapy
every Thursday.

24:28.468 --> 24:30.234
Any arguments, Paul?

24:31.771 --> 24:33.804
SCHIFF:
<i> What's the problem?</i>

24:33.806 --> 24:36.707
If Vilanis is that sick,
take a plea, get it over with.

24:36.709 --> 24:37.942
You don't think I tried?

24:37.944 --> 24:40.244
You got enough
to convict or what?

24:40.246 --> 24:42.179
Motive,
ample opportunity--

24:42.181 --> 24:44.782
the brokerage firm was unsecured

24:44.784 --> 24:47.051
plus the FBI
ballistics report.

24:47.053 --> 24:48.686
Get a trial date.

24:48.688 --> 24:50.187
Get it over with, quick, easy.

24:50.189 --> 24:53.124
It may not be
that easy.

24:53.125 --> 24:56.060
I used to pick up my grandfather
after his chemo treatments.

24:56.062 --> 24:58.162
Yeah. And?

24:58.164 --> 25:00.731
And all he could do afterwards
was puke his guts out

25:00.733 --> 25:02.900
and then fall into bed.

25:04.871 --> 25:06.871
Let me talk to the man.

25:06.873 --> 25:10.708
<i> I checked with Dr. Bergman</i>
<i> at St. Eligius, Simon.</i>

25:10.710 --> 25:14.745
She said the floor was jammed
the night McFadden was hit.

25:14.747 --> 25:18.082
She didn't get around to you
till almost midnight.

25:18.084 --> 25:21.218
I shouldn't be talking to you
without a lawyer.

25:21.220 --> 25:23.821
You're representing yourself,
Simon, remember?

25:23.823 --> 25:25.723
You're your
own lawyer.

25:25.725 --> 25:27.892
Oh, yeah.

25:30.730 --> 25:34.965
And then... she gave you
a dose of doxorubicin?

25:34.967 --> 25:36.233
Yeah.

25:36.235 --> 25:39.303
And 120 milligrams
of CIS-platinum?

25:39.305 --> 25:40.571
Yeah.

25:40.573 --> 25:41.805
That's heavy chemotherapy.

25:41.807 --> 25:43.073
Way too heavy to go out

25:43.075 --> 25:44.308
and stalk somebody

25:44.310 --> 25:46.043
and then shoot them.

25:46.045 --> 25:47.845
So what's the story?

25:47.847 --> 25:49.980
What's with this
<i> pro se</i> nonsense?

25:49.982 --> 25:51.782
I want my day in court

25:51.784 --> 25:54.752
to show what that bastard
did to us.

25:54.754 --> 25:56.320
But you didn't kill McFadden.

25:56.322 --> 26:00.157
Nope, but I'd make
a hell of a scapegoat,

26:00.159 --> 26:02.159
me and my big mouth.

26:05.031 --> 26:09.166
When your gun was stolen,
did they break in or what?

26:09.168 --> 26:12.803
Somebody picked the lock, or...

26:12.805 --> 26:13.904
Or had a key.

26:13.906 --> 26:15.005
Listen, I pay

26:15.007 --> 26:17.141
900 bucks a month
for this dump.

26:17.143 --> 26:20.277
Who could afford
to hand out spare keys?

26:27.286 --> 26:28.953
You okay?

26:30.890 --> 26:31.889
Yeah, yeah.

26:31.891 --> 26:33.624
When your insurance
crapped out

26:33.626 --> 26:36.360
wasn't there anyone
you could turn to?

26:40.032 --> 26:44.301
The Labor Department--
occupational illness.

26:44.303 --> 26:47.171
But I wasn't
their number-one priority,

26:47.173 --> 26:48.973
shall we say?

26:51.644 --> 26:55.346
It's not just Simon Vilanis.
Hundreds of workers had
their health plans gutted.

26:55.348 --> 26:56.914
We're aware of that.

26:56.916 --> 26:59.350
Mr. Vilanis's story
is known to us.

26:59.352 --> 27:02.052
You can stonewall him,
but not me.

27:02.054 --> 27:03.354
He told you that?

27:03.356 --> 27:04.355
Yeah.

27:04.357 --> 27:05.356
Figures.

27:05.358 --> 27:07.024
The man's in trouble.

27:07.026 --> 27:08.659
That's what I'm saying.

27:08.661 --> 27:11.962
He thinks no one listens
to him, but far from it.

27:11.964 --> 27:13.097
Okay, you listen.

27:13.099 --> 27:14.131
<i> Listened.</i>

27:14.133 --> 27:15.966
I gave our investigation

27:15.968 --> 27:18.936
to the Justice Department
for prosecution.

27:18.938 --> 27:21.038
Who at Justice?

27:21.039 --> 27:23.139
Fellow named Cousins
in the Bank Fraud division.

27:23.142 --> 27:25.843
McFadden used
the workers' health fund

27:25.845 --> 27:27.344
to finance a takeover--

27:27.346 --> 27:30.180
he and some bank
he had in his pocket.

27:30.182 --> 27:31.181
What bank?

27:31.183 --> 27:33.183
Bank of the Five Boroughs.

27:33.185 --> 27:36.954
You'd better talk to Cousins,
if you can find him.

27:36.956 --> 27:38.889
They shut down
his office--

27:38.891 --> 27:40.290
budget cut.

27:41.861 --> 27:43.127
When was that?

27:43.129 --> 27:47.297
When he was this close
to indicting McFadden.

27:47.299 --> 27:49.867
Are we talking bank fraud
or murder

27:49.869 --> 27:51.201
or we don't know?

27:51.203 --> 27:52.870
We're looking for a connection.

27:52.872 --> 27:55.339
Apparently the victim
was about to be indicted.

27:55.341 --> 27:57.107
Apparently?

27:57.109 --> 27:58.375
What's going on?

27:58.377 --> 28:00.377
is getting bigger.
The case

28:00.379 --> 28:02.913
McFadden was
the classic '80s shark.

28:02.915 --> 28:05.082
old, failing companies--
He'd go after

28:05.084 --> 28:07.284
take whatever was worth
salvaging.
In this case,

28:07.286 --> 28:09.420
the workers' housing, health and
pension funds.

28:09.422 --> 28:12.956
Which he invested
in high-risk bonds that failed.

28:12.958 --> 28:14.725
Then he dumped the company

28:14.727 --> 28:17.361
and the lender
just wrote off the loss.

28:17.363 --> 28:18.996
Sure.

28:18.998 --> 28:22.366
Someone at the bank
was profiting from the takeover.

28:22.368 --> 28:23.934
Who?

28:23.936 --> 28:27.037
The lender was
the Bank of the Five Boroughs.

28:27.039 --> 28:29.239
These are
the officers.

28:37.316 --> 28:39.049
Adam?

28:40.953 --> 28:42.052
What?

28:42.054 --> 28:44.288
I know that bank.

28:44.290 --> 28:48.325
Dwight Corcoran is the chairman.

28:48.327 --> 28:50.494
Governor Corcoran,
former Secretary of State,

28:50.496 --> 28:52.996
Ambassador to England--
that Corcoran?

28:52.998 --> 28:54.965
That Corcoran.

28:54.967 --> 28:59.036
He and I cut our teeth together
in politics,

28:59.038 --> 29:00.971
right out of law school.

29:00.973 --> 29:03.974
Why isn't he listed
as a bank officer?

29:03.976 --> 29:05.075
The man is 68.

29:05.077 --> 29:08.946
I doubt if he's in there
counting bills

29:08.948 --> 29:10.748
every day.

29:10.750 --> 29:12.282
What happened, I guess,

29:12.284 --> 29:15.986
is someone heard
of McFadden's pending indictment

29:15.988 --> 29:18.956
and figured he'd panic
and take a plea.

29:18.958 --> 29:22.326
Only Justice would be privy
to that information.

29:22.328 --> 29:26.263
Someone at the bank
got nervous...

29:26.265 --> 29:31.001
This murder
could have been preemptive.

29:31.003 --> 29:33.003
at Justice,
We find the leak

29:33.005 --> 29:35.072
squeeze him,
and find the killer.

29:35.074 --> 29:37.474
Where is
that Justice investigator?

29:37.476 --> 29:38.976
Cousins is his name?

29:38.978 --> 29:41.779
Doing pro bono work
on Liberty Street.

29:41.781 --> 29:43.347
I've called there twice.

29:43.349 --> 29:44.448
He's never in.

29:44.450 --> 29:47.151
Try him again.

29:47.153 --> 29:51.221
I'll see what I can find out
from the other end.

29:56.996 --> 29:59.096
You leave
the Justice Department,

29:59.098 --> 30:01.231
you can get hired
on Park Avenue.

30:01.233 --> 30:03.500
Sure. I can represent banks.
I'm an expert, after all.

30:03.502 --> 30:06.837
I'll take widows and orphans
hurt by exploding toasters.

30:06.839 --> 30:08.539
Maybe I don't sleep better,

30:08.541 --> 30:13.043
but at least I like getting
out of bed in the morning.

30:13.045 --> 30:15.479
Who was in bed
with Marshall McFadden?

30:15.481 --> 30:18.382
Half of official Washington.

30:18.384 --> 30:20.551
They stay under
the covers together?

30:20.553 --> 30:23.387
I'd hear about a file
at the IRS--

30:23.389 --> 30:24.421
Whoops, misplaced.

30:24.423 --> 30:26.190
Comptroller of Currency--

30:26.192 --> 30:28.458
they treated me like
I was stealing silverware.

30:28.460 --> 30:31.094
I thought you had
sufficient evidence.

30:31.096 --> 30:33.063
I was ready
to indict McFadden

30:33.065 --> 30:35.566
with eight counts
of bank fraud.

30:35.567 --> 30:38.068
Suddenly, they were changing
the locks on my office door.

30:38.070 --> 30:39.069
"They"?

30:39.071 --> 30:40.070
They.

30:40.072 --> 30:43.073
Told me
it was budgetary.

30:43.075 --> 30:47.311
Before you were shut down,
who was on your staff?

30:47.313 --> 30:50.147
I'll need names, addresses.

30:50.149 --> 30:53.617
Ben Turner.
He moved over to HUD.

30:53.619 --> 30:56.887
Kevin Morehead at Trott
and Donovan, Park Avenue.

30:56.889 --> 31:01.859
Mike McNeer, I hear...
maybe a monastery.

31:01.861 --> 31:03.527
You got this wrong.

31:03.529 --> 31:08.365
Nobody in my office told anybody
we were indicting McFadden.

31:08.367 --> 31:11.101
Let's hope so.

31:12.171 --> 31:14.371
40 years, Adam.

31:14.373 --> 31:17.174
Did we ever back a winner?

31:17.176 --> 31:19.109
We backed you
for governor.

31:19.111 --> 31:21.178
Hell of a lot
different than backing.

31:21.180 --> 31:24.081
Without your brilliant
political strategies,

31:24.083 --> 31:26.183
I'd have never seen Albany.

31:26.185 --> 31:27.551
Don't act so modest.

31:27.553 --> 31:30.254
If you'd run
my second campaign,

31:30.256 --> 31:34.524
maybe I wouldn't have been
a one-term wonder.

31:34.526 --> 31:37.294
You made your mark
in other ways.

31:38.664 --> 31:42.099
The road less traveled?

31:42.101 --> 31:44.201
No regrets here.

31:44.203 --> 31:46.470
Then why the sudden
turn into banking?

31:46.472 --> 31:48.939
Maybe this is a battle
I can win.

31:48.941 --> 31:50.274
Our contemporaries--

31:50.276 --> 31:53.110
they're not just
the captains of industry.

31:53.112 --> 31:54.211
They're the generals.

31:54.213 --> 31:56.647
Envy? Ridiculous.

31:56.649 --> 31:59.300
With your record,

31:59.301 --> 32:01.952
they're going to be naming
junior high schools after you.

32:01.954 --> 32:05.255
My children,
their children--

32:05.257 --> 32:07.491
when my time has come,

32:07.493 --> 32:13.463
I'd like to give them more
than a folded American flag.

32:13.465 --> 32:17.134
The bank asked me
to sit on the board.

32:17.136 --> 32:20.570
My name-- to them,
it's worth a lot of money.

32:20.572 --> 32:23.540
Dwight, is there anything
I should know

32:23.542 --> 32:25.642
about your bank's business?

32:25.644 --> 32:32.382
Adam, we've been friends
for more than four decades.

32:32.384 --> 32:35.953
If there was anything,

32:35.955 --> 32:40.257
believe me,
you'd be the first to know.

32:42.661 --> 32:43.660
Thank you.

32:43.662 --> 32:45.329
I've done complete bios

32:45.331 --> 32:48.999
on everyone involved
in the McFadden investigation.

32:49.001 --> 32:52.402
Rappoport and McNeer
aren't connected to the bank.

32:52.404 --> 32:53.670
And Morehead?

32:53.672 --> 32:56.006
Inherited his old man's
blue blood,

32:56.008 --> 32:59.509
who is currently the senior
partner at Tyler and Jones.

32:59.511 --> 33:01.511
Guess who ran their
international department,

33:01.513 --> 33:03.280
in the early '70s?

33:03.282 --> 33:04.381
Dwight Corcoran.

33:04.383 --> 33:06.316
Whose biggest client
at the time

33:06.318 --> 33:08.185
was a young British upstart
named...

33:08.187 --> 33:10.253
Marshall McFadden.

33:12.291 --> 33:16.727
I want Mr. Morehead in my office
first thing tomorrow morning.

33:19.565 --> 33:21.298
So there was a leak.

33:21.300 --> 33:23.567
What is it, a slow news day?

33:23.569 --> 33:26.003
You're the only one
who was privy

33:26.005 --> 33:28.038
to the pending indictment
of McFadden

33:28.040 --> 33:30.307
and connected
to Dwight Corcoran.

33:30.309 --> 33:32.376
We know what you did,
Mr. Morehead.

33:32.378 --> 33:33.777
The only remaining issue

33:33.779 --> 33:36.213
is how long
you'll spend in prison.

33:36.215 --> 33:37.748
Wait a minute.

33:37.750 --> 33:40.484
Even if I did
speak out of school,

33:40.486 --> 33:43.553
your office has no jurisdiction
and you know it.

33:43.555 --> 33:45.288
You don't understand.

33:45.290 --> 33:48.425
We are charging you
as an accomplice to murder.

33:48.427 --> 33:51.294
You can't do that.

33:51.296 --> 33:53.764
Yes, I can, sir,

33:53.766 --> 33:56.533
and I most definitely will.

34:02.674 --> 34:05.575
Full immunity,
state and federal.

34:05.577 --> 34:08.779
How you work it out
is your problem.

34:11.350 --> 34:14.284
You got to keep this
in perspective.

34:14.286 --> 34:16.319
It was the crazy '80s.

34:16.321 --> 34:17.788
Banks were floating loans

34:17.790 --> 34:20.524
to every creep
in a three-piece suit.

34:20.526 --> 34:23.260
Five Boroughs was no different.

34:23.262 --> 34:26.463
200 million in failed loans
since '82.

34:26.465 --> 34:28.265
Someone there was making money

34:28.267 --> 34:30.767
because of the bad loans
to McFadden.

34:30.769 --> 34:32.369
I never thought it was Corcoran.

34:32.371 --> 34:34.371
Then why the leak?

34:34.373 --> 34:36.106
I grew up believing

34:36.108 --> 34:38.542
that Dwight Corcoran
was a good man.

34:38.544 --> 34:42.279
I wanted to let him know
that he was being investigated,

34:42.281 --> 34:45.715
so that he could disassociate
himself from the bank.

34:45.717 --> 34:48.085
I never thought...

34:48.854 --> 34:52.456
I had nothing
to do with any murder.

34:58.864 --> 35:01.364
You look like
the messenger

35:01.366 --> 35:03.700
who's afraid
he's going to be killed.

35:03.702 --> 35:06.603
I'm afraid the message
might kill the recipient.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.572
Well?

35:08.574 --> 35:12.776
Paul connected one of the staff
lawyers in Cousins' office

35:12.778 --> 35:16.413
with one of the bank officers,
all right.

35:16.415 --> 35:18.815
Apparently, the man's father

35:18.817 --> 35:21.751
was Corcoran's law partner
back in the '50s.

35:23.755 --> 35:25.388
And he told Corcoran

35:25.390 --> 35:27.791
about the pending indictment
on McFadden.

35:27.793 --> 35:30.393
I'm afraid so, Adam.

35:30.395 --> 35:32.462
Don't be.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.397
No fear, no favor.

35:37.336 --> 35:41.571
You know, that's an old liberal
muckraker's campaign slogan.

35:59.525 --> 36:01.525
As a result of these
preliminary findings,

36:01.527 --> 36:05.795
my office will begin
a full-scale investigation

36:05.797 --> 36:08.365
of fraud
in the banking industry.

36:08.367 --> 36:10.634
We're targeting what may amount

36:10.636 --> 36:14.504
to nearly $700 million worth
of fraudulent loans.

36:14.506 --> 36:16.773
That concludes my statement.

36:16.775 --> 36:19.342
I'm ready for questions.

36:19.344 --> 36:22.646
I've heard that the Bank
of the Five Boroughs

36:22.648 --> 36:24.381
might be investigated.

36:24.383 --> 36:25.749
Could you comment?

36:25.751 --> 36:28.385
Any bank
within our jurisdiction

36:28.387 --> 36:29.719
might be a target.

36:29.721 --> 36:32.822
Do you have information
about the Five Boroughs?

36:32.824 --> 36:34.391
Yes.

36:34.393 --> 36:37.427
Will you also target
individual bank officers?

36:37.429 --> 36:38.662
Yes.

36:38.664 --> 36:41.932
How far up the ladder
are you prepared to go?

36:41.934 --> 36:44.534
The investigation will go
wherever it goes.

36:44.536 --> 36:47.370
Isn't Governor Corcoran
chairman of the bank?

36:47.372 --> 36:49.506
That's our understanding.

36:49.508 --> 36:52.475
Don't you have
a relationship with him?

36:52.477 --> 36:56.413
Yes. Friendship
is no guarantee of immunity.

36:56.415 --> 36:58.448
"Friends" doesn't mean he'll
get preferential treatment.

36:58.450 --> 37:00.450
Do you want your own lecture?

37:00.452 --> 37:02.719
It's not about
conflict of interest,

37:02.721 --> 37:04.721
but the appearance
of conflict.

37:04.723 --> 37:06.990
The press has you
joined at the hip.

37:06.992 --> 37:09.593
Why throw fuel on the fire?
We recuse ourselves,

37:09.595 --> 37:12.829
the appellate division
appoints a special prosecutor.

37:12.831 --> 37:14.564
Recusal is mandatory
only if there's

37:14.566 --> 37:16.866
a business relationship
with the defendant.

37:16.868 --> 37:19.769
Dwight was my friend
and my political ally.

37:19.771 --> 37:22.606
Still, if we don't recuse
we may compromise

37:22.608 --> 37:25.475
the perceived integrity
of this office.

37:25.477 --> 37:27.477
Not if we convict
the son of a bitch.

37:27.479 --> 37:30.480
Get me a smoking gun.
Start at the bottom.

37:30.482 --> 37:33.750
Somebody broke into
Vilanis's apartment that night.

37:33.752 --> 37:37.487
ROBINETTE:
Well? Were you home
that night or not?

37:37.489 --> 37:38.755
No, I wasn't home.

37:38.757 --> 37:40.023
You told the police

37:40.025 --> 37:42.492
you didn't see
anything suspicious.

37:42.494 --> 37:43.727
If you weren't here,

37:43.729 --> 37:45.495
how did you see
anything?

37:45.497 --> 37:47.897
Lying to the police
is a felony.

37:47.899 --> 37:50.433
It's called obstruction.

37:52.638 --> 37:54.638
All right, there was a guy.

37:54.640 --> 37:56.973
He said he was a buddy
of Vilanis.

37:56.975 --> 37:58.975
You know, from the union.

37:58.977 --> 38:00.477
What did he want?

38:00.479 --> 38:02.746
He said Vilanis
sent him over

38:02.748 --> 38:05.782
to get some things from
his room, some papers
for their meeting.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.584
And you let him in?

38:07.586 --> 38:10.687
He had a union button,
you know, on his jacket.

38:10.689 --> 38:13.523
Did he take anything
out of the room?

38:13.525 --> 38:16.459
I wasn't paying attention.

38:16.461 --> 38:18.928
You pay attention
to what he looked like?

38:18.930 --> 38:20.530
He had black hair

38:20.532 --> 38:22.799
and cowboy boots--

38:22.801 --> 38:25.869
you know,
with the metal tips.

38:27.939 --> 38:30.573
He was a piece of work.

38:30.575 --> 38:34.611
(<i> coughing</i> )

38:36.548 --> 38:37.814
You want some juice?

38:37.816 --> 38:39.616
No, thanks.

38:39.618 --> 38:43.953
Well, it...
it sounds like Joey Boots.

38:43.955 --> 38:48.692
That's Joey Palmieri,
the Hoboken cowboy.

38:48.694 --> 38:50.827
Any relation
to Eddie Palmieri?

38:50.829 --> 38:52.996
The head of the union?

38:52.998 --> 38:56.099
Are you suggesting
there's nepotism

38:56.101 --> 38:57.701
in local 8157?

38:57.703 --> 38:59.502
(<i> chuckles</i> )

38:59.504 --> 39:02.639
That's Eddie Palmieri's
cousin--

39:02.641 --> 39:04.541
his wacko cousin.

39:04.543 --> 39:06.009
He takes orders from Eddie?

39:06.011 --> 39:08.878
He's supposed to work
for the union.

39:08.880 --> 39:12.882
With a little arm-twisting
and a little leg-breaking,

39:12.884 --> 39:14.517
Joey's your man.

39:14.519 --> 39:16.052
Why? What did he do now?

39:16.054 --> 39:18.755
That's still an open question.

39:18.757 --> 39:21.825
JOEY:
<i> You guys are nuts.</i>

39:21.827 --> 39:25.895
Vilanis is nuts. All
that hacking knocked
his screws loose.

39:25.897 --> 39:27.063
Do you deny

39:27.065 --> 39:28.665
you were in his room?

39:28.667 --> 39:29.766
Sure I deny it.

39:29.768 --> 39:31.701
You work
for Local 8157,

39:31.703 --> 39:32.902
is that correct?

39:32.904 --> 39:34.037
That's right.

39:34.039 --> 39:35.672
And you take orders

39:35.674 --> 39:37.774
from your cousin,
Eddie Palmieri?

39:47.586 --> 39:50.720
I take orders
from the rank and file.

39:50.722 --> 39:53.823
Just what do you do
for the rank and file, sir?

40:02.634 --> 40:06.870
I promote union solidarity
and discipline.

40:06.872 --> 40:08.638
You're both Palmieris.

40:08.640 --> 40:09.773
Don't give us that.

40:09.775 --> 40:12.041
He is my cousin,
not my Siamese twin.

40:12.043 --> 40:14.043
His life does not concern me.

40:14.045 --> 40:16.045
He breaks in, steals a gun,

40:16.047 --> 40:19.649
uses the gun to kill the guy
who's lining your pockets.

40:19.651 --> 40:20.784
It would concern me.

40:20.786 --> 40:23.052
Joey Boots
killed McFadden.

40:23.054 --> 40:24.621
We know that.

40:24.623 --> 40:27.123
We also know that he
took orders from you.

40:27.125 --> 40:29.192
You got proof
Joey offed the guy,

40:29.194 --> 40:31.661
I'll testify
against him myself.

40:31.663 --> 40:34.197
As for the money,
it's totally above board.

40:34.199 --> 40:35.665
McFadden pays you...

40:35.667 --> 40:37.867
PALMIERI:
McFadden gave me shinola.

40:37.869 --> 40:40.637
It was his wife's foundation.
I did some consulting.

40:40.639 --> 40:41.938
You expect me to
believe that, Eddie?

40:41.940 --> 40:43.807
You sold out your union.

40:43.809 --> 40:44.941
I tried to save it.

40:44.943 --> 40:46.209
There's a recession.

40:46.211 --> 40:47.944
We had to make cutbacks.

40:47.946 --> 40:50.814
The letter to the bank was
legit, the payment was legit.

40:50.816 --> 40:52.716
You want my cousin Joey?

40:52.717 --> 40:54.617
Why don't you give<i> him</i> a
migraine for a change?

40:54.619 --> 40:56.619
The union boss was the link.

40:56.621 --> 40:58.087
Eddie Palmieri facilitated deals

40:58.089 --> 41:00.623
between McFadden
and Corcoran's bank.

41:00.625 --> 41:02.625
Not enough--
I want a smoking gun.

41:02.627 --> 41:04.627
His cousin was
the trigger man.

41:04.629 --> 41:06.663
I want a smoking gun
with fingerprints.

41:06.665 --> 41:08.665
What about the payment--
$100,000?

41:08.667 --> 41:10.633
The check
was made out to Palmieri.

41:10.635 --> 41:13.169
He's still sticking
by his consulting fee story.

41:13.171 --> 41:15.638
Then we need more.

41:15.640 --> 41:17.740
A check signed by McFadden--
that's not enough?

41:17.742 --> 41:19.042
No.

41:19.044 --> 41:21.678
It wasn't McFadden himself.

41:21.680 --> 41:24.047
It was a foundation, remember?

41:24.049 --> 41:26.916
The Ann McFadden Foundation.

41:26.918 --> 41:28.818
The what?

41:28.819 --> 41:30.719
The Ann McFadden Foundation

41:30.722 --> 41:33.690
for Cancer Research.

41:33.692 --> 41:37.861
I gave him $1,000
every year for five years.

41:37.863 --> 41:39.863
That foundation...

41:39.865 --> 41:43.199
one year, we were
on the banquet committee.

41:45.837 --> 41:48.638
Him?

41:48.640 --> 41:50.640
Dwight Corcoran--

41:50.642 --> 41:54.644
trustee of the foundation.

41:54.646 --> 41:57.180
He had to approve all checks.

41:57.182 --> 42:00.750
So it was Corcoran
who paid Palmieri, not McFadden.

42:00.752 --> 42:02.752
The money had to
be for the hit.

42:02.754 --> 42:04.153
No way Corcoran wants

42:04.155 --> 42:05.955
to do heavy jail time.

42:05.957 --> 42:08.224
A little push,
he'll give us the Palmieris.

42:08.226 --> 42:12.028
That's exactly what I want you
to tell Palmieri.

42:12.030 --> 42:14.731
You want us
to deal Eddie and Joey?

42:14.733 --> 42:16.933
I want Corcoran.

42:21.673 --> 42:24.908
So you cajoled
Mr. Vilanis's landlord

42:24.910 --> 42:27.176
into letting you in.

42:27.178 --> 42:30.313
And then what?

42:30.315 --> 42:33.182
Then I found the guy's gun...

42:33.184 --> 42:36.185
taped the handle and the trigger

42:36.187 --> 42:39.188
and stuck it
in my pocket.

42:39.190 --> 42:42.191
Back home, I filed
the numbers down.

42:42.193 --> 42:46.796
STONE:
And you used the gun to kill
Mr. McFadden, right?

42:46.798 --> 42:48.064
That's right.

42:48.066 --> 42:49.732
Why did you use

42:49.734 --> 42:53.703
Mr. Vilanis as your scapegoat?

42:53.705 --> 42:57.006
The guy had a big mouth.

42:57.008 --> 43:00.843
Everybody in the union knew
he hated McFadden,

43:00.845 --> 43:04.247
'cause he took over the company
and ran it into the ground.

43:04.249 --> 43:06.950
And?

43:06.952 --> 43:12.255
Plus he's dying of cancer,
so what the hell?

43:12.257 --> 43:15.858
What's he going
to care, right?

43:15.860 --> 43:18.328
Who paid you to do the hit?

43:25.036 --> 43:27.804
My cousin Eddie.

43:27.806 --> 43:29.806
Tell me, Mr. Palmieri,

43:29.808 --> 43:33.776
do you recognize
People's Exhibit 37-M?

43:35.847 --> 43:37.780
Yes, I do.

43:42.120 --> 43:45.121
It is a check for $100,000,

43:45.123 --> 43:46.990
made out to you

43:46.992 --> 43:48.925
and drawn from the account

43:48.927 --> 43:51.861
of the Ann McFadden Foundation,
is that right?

43:51.863 --> 43:54.397
Yeah, that's right.

43:54.398 --> 43:56.932
On the books, it was supposed
to pay for my union people

43:56.935 --> 43:59.235
to set up the tables and stuff

43:59.237 --> 44:02.205
for the annual banquet.

44:02.207 --> 44:03.940
The foundation's annual banquet?

44:03.942 --> 44:05.308
Yeah, that's right.

44:05.310 --> 44:07.810
Mr. Corcoran had the check

44:07.812 --> 44:09.946
signed by the secretary.

44:09.948 --> 44:12.815
Objection. Outside the scope
of the witness' knowledge.

44:12.817 --> 44:14.984
Let me rephrase
the question.

44:14.986 --> 44:17.820
How did this check get
into your hands, sir?

44:17.822 --> 44:21.958
Well, I was having dinner
at Park's Steak House

44:21.960 --> 44:26.329
and Mr. Corcoran came in
and joined me for dessert.

44:26.331 --> 44:27.997
Then what happened?

44:27.999 --> 44:29.999
He gave me the check.

44:30.001 --> 44:32.869
He told me
to take care of the problem

44:32.871 --> 44:35.104
that we had discussed earlier.

44:35.106 --> 44:36.839
What problem?

44:39.177 --> 44:41.844
McFadden's indictment.

44:41.846 --> 44:44.013
He said if McFadden
goes down,

44:44.015 --> 44:46.015
he'll name names

44:46.017 --> 44:49.018
and we'll all go down
with him.

44:49.020 --> 44:51.921
So the check wasn't
for setting up tables.

44:51.923 --> 44:53.406
You kidding?

44:53.407 --> 44:54.890
Marshall McFadden, right?
It was to kill

44:54.893 --> 44:56.192
Objection.

44:56.194 --> 44:57.994
Withdrawn.

44:59.230 --> 45:01.931
Tell me, Mr. Palmieri,

45:01.933 --> 45:07.303
why did Mr. Corcoran
pay you $100,000?

45:10.909 --> 45:13.309
You know.

45:13.311 --> 45:17.213
It was to kill the English guy,
McFadden.

45:29.494 --> 45:31.027
Thank you.

45:42.974 --> 45:46.976
MALE REPORTER:
Mr. Corcoran, could we get
a statement from you?

45:46.978 --> 45:48.244
(<i> reporters clamoring</i> )

45:48.246 --> 45:50.246
SCHIFF:
Norwich...

45:50.248 --> 45:52.515
bring him around
the back stairs.

45:52.517 --> 45:54.117
Thank you, Adam.

45:54.119 --> 45:55.251
Thank you.

45:55.253 --> 45:57.186
I could use a friend.

45:57.188 --> 45:59.989
You always did, Dwight.

45:59.991 --> 46:02.358
That was always the problem.

46:10.001 --> 46:12.335
What is your reaction
to the decision?
