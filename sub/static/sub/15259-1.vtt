00:54.013 --> 00:56.515
Hello, trouble.

00:56.515 --> 00:58.100
Don't you sneak up on me
like that.

01:07.651 --> 01:11.322
<i>The past can define our future.</i>

01:11.322 --> 01:12.656
<i>But I won't let it.</i>

01:12.656 --> 01:14.867
<i>Okay, so you really think</i>

01:14.867 --> 01:18.370
<i>that our education system is
failing the current generation?</i>

01:18.370 --> 01:20.206
<i>It's like the first World War.</i>

01:20.206 --> 01:23.167
<i>A whole generation,
full of promise, wiped out.</i>

01:23.167 --> 01:25.377
<i>Except this time we're doing it
through terrible education.</i>

01:28.756 --> 01:31.717
<i>We are commodities
in a global market.</i>

01:36.472 --> 01:38.808
<i>The world isn't ruled
by politicians,</i>

01:38.808 --> 01:41.268
<i>presidents or elected officials.</i>

01:44.188 --> 01:46.690
<i>Can you tell me where our next
innovators are coming from?</i>

01:46.690 --> 01:49.985
<i>Where is the grounding for our
new leaders of commerce?</i>

01:52.988 --> 01:57.618
<i>We are going to create a new
generation of obese kids.</i>

02:00.830 --> 02:02.790
No future. No hope.

02:06.794 --> 02:09.588
We need to generate
our own super thinkers

02:09.588 --> 02:11.841
<i>before the likes
of China and India</i>

02:11.841 --> 02:14.552
<i>move so far ahead of us,
we never catch up.</i>

02:15.970 --> 02:17.972
Things have to change.

02:17.972 --> 02:20.182
<i>We are creating uneducated</i>

02:20.182 --> 02:22.852
<i>unmoralled monsters
who bleed this country dry.</i>

02:29.108 --> 02:31.068
<i>Steps are being taken.</i>

02:55.176 --> 02:55.885
Hello?

02:56.093 --> 02:57.761
<i>Hello, this is
the facility calling.</i>

02:57.970 --> 03:01.891
Oh, yeah. Hi, um...
I will be leaving now.

03:01.891 --> 03:05.561
I still can't believe I've been
accepted, I'm so grateful.

03:05.561 --> 03:08.647
<i>Remember, you've signed
a confidentiality clause.</i>

03:08.647 --> 03:11.317
<i>We take security very seriously.</i>

03:11.317 --> 03:13.277
Yeah, of course,
ab... absolutely.

03:13.277 --> 03:15.571
I... I don't know
who I'd tell anyway.

03:15.571 --> 03:17.573
<i>I see here your doctor
has provided us</i>

03:17.573 --> 03:19.158
<i>with your psychological
evaluation</i>

03:19.158 --> 03:20.784
<i>and all requested vitals.</i>

03:20.784 --> 03:24.330
Oh, yeah, uh, I was,
I was wondering...

03:24.330 --> 03:26.332
<i>You want to ask?</i>

03:26.332 --> 03:28.834
Oh, I... I didn't wanna
appear rude.

03:28.834 --> 03:31.128
<i>We log your prints and vitals
into the system</i>

03:31.128 --> 03:33.047
<i>so you can access the facility.</i>

03:33.047 --> 03:35.466
<i>I'm sure you'll understand
that we have to ensure</i>

03:35.466 --> 03:38.427
<i>that strangers
just can't walk in.</i>

03:38.427 --> 03:40.262
Of course,
that makes perfect sense.

03:40.262 --> 03:41.597
<i>We look forward
to meeting you.</i>

03:42.890 --> 03:44.350
Hello?

03:54.401 --> 03:56.779
I am leaving now, Nina.

03:56.779 --> 03:59.823
Um... are you sure
you have everything?

03:59.823 --> 04:03.410
Uh, oh, Dr. Zauh
will be here on Monday.

04:03.410 --> 04:05.162
At 3 o'clock. I know.

04:05.162 --> 04:08.916
It's on the calendar.
And on the wall.

04:08.916 --> 04:09.959
Jenny...

04:11.627 --> 04:14.171
She'll be fine.
Stop worrying.

04:14.171 --> 04:18.300
Go and have fun, and remember,
I'm gonna be here 24/7.

04:20.844 --> 04:22.304
Thank you, Nina.

04:24.181 --> 04:25.766
Yeah, if, um...

04:25.766 --> 04:28.936
If I go back in there now,
I'm never gonna leave, so...

04:37.987 --> 04:41.073
Love you, mom.

06:16.293 --> 06:20.672
Sub-level 1. Sub-level 2.
Sub-level 3.

06:34.478 --> 06:37.064
<i>How may we help you?</i>

06:37.064 --> 06:38.982
Hi, could you tell me
which floor

06:38.982 --> 06:40.984
<i>the Posterity Project is on?</i>

06:40.984 --> 06:42.653
You must have
the wrong address.

06:42.653 --> 06:44.822
<i>Oh, I see, it's just, um...</i>

06:44.988 --> 06:46.990
<i>No Posterity Project here.</i>

06:56.166 --> 06:57.459
<i>Authorized.</i>

07:26.989 --> 07:28.949
What the hell?

07:41.295 --> 07:44.089
<i>Yeah, uh, I lived there
my whole life...</i>

07:44.089 --> 07:45.799
<i>My ex, Cathy...</i>

07:45.799 --> 07:48.427
<i>Awesome, yeah.
I know where it is.</i>

07:48.427 --> 07:51.847
<i>I drove through there
with a girlfriend.</i>

07:51.847 --> 07:54.391
<i>- Girlfriend?
- Yes.</i>

07:54.391 --> 07:56.351
<i>My friend who is a girl.</i>

08:34.097 --> 08:38.309
I kinda just... I guess I just
walked into it, really.

08:38.309 --> 08:43.023
Speaking of just walking in,
who do we have here, then?

08:43.023 --> 08:44.942
Um, I'm Jenny.

08:44.942 --> 08:46.944
Are you sure?

08:46.944 --> 08:49.404
Oh, yeah.
Definitely Jenny.

08:49.404 --> 08:52.282
I think we're going to have
to watch this one, Jenny.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.451
It's Darby, right?

08:54.451 --> 08:56.662
Yeah, Darby.

08:56.662 --> 09:00.749
You know, Darby is the oldest
recorded surname.

09:00.749 --> 09:03.043
It dates back to, like, 1160.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.045
But Darby is your first name,
right?

09:05.045 --> 09:08.048
Yeah, just a bit of history
to break the ice.

09:09.883 --> 09:14.680
Okay. Well, now fact guy
has introduced himself...

09:14.680 --> 09:16.056
I'm Antigone.

09:16.223 --> 09:19.851
The only real fact I have about
my name is that I don't like it.

09:19.851 --> 09:22.521
- So call me Tiggs.
- Nice to meet you, Tiggs.

09:22.521 --> 09:24.481
Um, nice to meet you, Darby.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.068
Yeah, it's, uh,
a little dramatic

09:28.235 --> 09:31.697
this whole...
underground situation.

09:31.697 --> 09:34.032
It's just secure, that's all.

09:34.032 --> 09:36.618
Makes me feel safe
and kind of important, actually.

09:36.618 --> 09:39.538
Which is nice, right, Jenny?

09:39.538 --> 09:43.917
<i>Welcome to the facility.
Please take a seat.</i>

09:43.917 --> 09:45.877
<i>Congratulations
on your selection</i>

09:45.877 --> 09:48.505
<i>to the Posterity Project.</i>

09:48.505 --> 09:51.300
<i>You are here to act as
chaperones to the candidates.</i>

09:52.926 --> 09:55.053
<i>A group selected
for intelligence trials</i>

09:55.220 --> 09:57.848
<i>using augmented
reality technology.</i>

09:59.641 --> 10:04.271
<i>The time to save
our country's future is now.</i>

10:04.271 --> 10:05.647
<i>Wow, that was nice.</i>

10:05.647 --> 10:09.026
I can't wait to get started
and to save the world.

10:09.026 --> 10:10.319
Can we just...?

10:10.319 --> 10:11.695
Can you remind me

10:11.903 --> 10:14.823
wha... what are we...
doing here?

10:19.786 --> 10:22.497
<i>Always follow
instructed protocol.</i>

10:22.497 --> 10:24.666
<i>Do not disturb the candidates.</i>

10:24.666 --> 10:28.879
<i>Do not attempt to exit
the facility unless authorized.</i>

10:28.879 --> 10:30.881
<i>If you break protocol,
you will be</i>

10:30.881 --> 10:32.716
<i>immediately removed
from the project</i>

10:32.716 --> 10:34.092
<i>and will not receive payment.</i>

10:34.092 --> 10:35.886
Oh, great!

10:35.886 --> 10:37.012
<i>You will have a personal guide</i>

10:37.179 --> 10:39.348
<i>during your time
in the facility.</i>

10:41.850 --> 10:43.560
Woah, woah, woah.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.529
<i>I feel like Geordi La Forge.</i>

10:57.324 --> 10:58.700
"Star Trek."

11:00.202 --> 11:01.620
Really?

11:01.620 --> 11:04.915
<i>Hello, Jenny, Darby, Tiggs.
I am Arial.</i>

11:04.915 --> 11:08.794
<i>Augmented Reality Information

11:08.794 --> 11:11.797

11:11.797 --> 11:13.799
<i>Throughout the duration
of your stay,</i>

11:13.799 --> 11:17.135
<i>I shall be your guide
here in the facility.</i>

11:17.135 --> 11:18.553
<i>Please, don't be startled.</i>

11:18.553 --> 11:22.140
<i>The glasses' recognition
software is initializing.</i>

11:22.140 --> 11:24.810
<i>The technology in the glasses
allows them to access</i>

11:24.810 --> 11:27.270
<i>and interact
with their surroundings.</i>

11:27.270 --> 11:31.316
Wait, see if it can tell us
where I got this bag from

11:31.483 --> 11:34.236
and how many thousands
of dollars I paid for it.

11:34.236 --> 11:36.697
- Arial?
<i>- No problem.</i>

11:36.697 --> 11:39.950
<i>Object, woman's bag,
faux designer.</i>

11:39.950 --> 11:43.620
<i>Woman's jacket, fake leather,
also faux designer.</i>

11:43.620 --> 11:47.374
Oh, okay,
that is the first time

11:47.541 --> 11:50.836
anyone has ever
guessed it was a fake.

11:50.836 --> 11:52.003
Seriously.

11:52.003 --> 11:54.047
Nice work, Arial.
Nice work.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.133
Just don't point that thing
at my hair.

11:56.133 --> 11:59.678
<i>Touch the side of your glasses
to view a map of the facility.</i>

12:09.813 --> 12:13.108
<i>I will now guide you to
the highlighted area on the map.</i>

12:13.108 --> 12:15.652
Come on, everyone, follow me.

12:55.817 --> 12:58.320
<i>Hey, I think I'm gonna
keep these on.</i>

12:58.487 --> 13:00.155
- What was that, Jen?
- The glasses.

13:00.155 --> 13:03.116
I just took them off and I
literally couldn't see a thing.

13:04.659 --> 13:06.286
Holy shit!

13:06.286 --> 13:08.997
Ha-ha. Woah!
Are we in a cave?

13:13.543 --> 13:16.296
That is... weird.

13:41.404 --> 13:43.990
<i>The candidates are provided
with a monitored diet</i>

13:43.990 --> 13:46.493
<i>based on their
nutritional requirements.</i>

13:46.493 --> 13:50.622
<i>This ensures optimum performance
in neurological development.</i>

13:50.622 --> 13:51.915
That's horrendous.

13:51.915 --> 13:54.376
<i>It's nourishment that counts,
not taste.</i>

13:54.376 --> 13:57.420
Well, I often like
a healthy serving of cat food

13:57.420 --> 13:59.381
on a Friday night,
instead of Chinese.

14:00.382 --> 14:02.300
<i>Let's keep moving, everyone.</i>

14:06.012 --> 14:08.515
<i>The candidates
don't really speak.</i>

14:08.515 --> 14:10.267
<i>They don't need to.</i>

14:10.267 --> 14:12.769
<i>They communicate like a unit.</i>

14:12.769 --> 14:16.189
<i>We encourage them to indulge
only in the necessary</i>

14:16.189 --> 14:18.108
<i>and not the pointless.</i>

14:22.028 --> 14:25.365
<i>Welcome to the Learning Space.</i>

14:25.365 --> 14:28.118
<i>The candidates,
they're children.</i>

14:29.369 --> 14:32.914
<i>- Okay, this is...
- So strange.</i>

14:32.914 --> 14:34.124
Yeah.

14:45.468 --> 14:49.097
<i>Darby, please do not get
too close to the candidates.</i>

14:54.895 --> 14:57.856
<i>Darby, I really don't want
to ask you again.</i>

15:00.734 --> 15:02.694
Well, uh, awkward.

15:06.865 --> 15:09.826
<i>You are now entering
the playroom.</i>

15:14.414 --> 15:17.375
Wow. This is so cool.

15:18.501 --> 15:20.003
Oh...

15:20.003 --> 15:22.088
<i>He looks like
he's enjoying himself.</i>

15:47.072 --> 15:49.491
Cozy.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.333
That's better. Mm.

15:59.042 --> 16:01.252
Wow.

16:01.252 --> 16:04.798
Yeah, I thought,
I thought you were cool...

16:04.798 --> 16:08.510
Literally until that moment.

16:08.510 --> 16:10.887
Thought I'd just try and
brighten the place up a little.

16:10.887 --> 16:14.766
I knew you were an artist.

16:14.766 --> 16:17.060
Yep, artist hands.

16:17.060 --> 16:20.480
You're gonna have to work
that magic in my room.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.440
A lovely touch, Jenny.

16:31.574 --> 16:33.868
<i>Please place your hand
on the circle.</i>

16:37.122 --> 16:39.874
<i>Unpack, relax and settle in.</i>

16:39.874 --> 16:41.543
Thanks.

16:41.543 --> 16:42.961
Cozy.

16:46.840 --> 16:50.135
<i>Tiggs, Darby, please allow me
to show you to your rooms.</i>

16:50.135 --> 16:52.762
- See you later, Jen.
- See ya.

17:01.229 --> 17:03.565
Arial, who do I speak to
about getting an extra pillow?

17:03.732 --> 17:05.567
<i>I will look into it, Darby.</i>

17:05.567 --> 17:09.237
<i>Your door is the first
on your left.</i>

17:09.237 --> 17:12.115
<i>Please turn around, you have
walked past your room.</i>

17:12.115 --> 17:14.992
I can't believe I'm taking
orders from a computer.

17:53.406 --> 17:54.908
Hello, Jenny.

17:54.908 --> 17:57.327
Oh, Arial. Hi.

17:57.327 --> 18:00.413
I'm sorry, Jenny,
I didn't mean to startle you.

18:00.413 --> 18:01.915
No, no, it's fine.

18:01.915 --> 18:04.209
I guess I just
wasn't expecting you.

18:04.209 --> 18:07.212
- I'm feeling pretty tired.
- I imagine you are.

18:07.212 --> 18:08.713
I don't sleep.

18:08.713 --> 18:11.883
Although technically, my system
does have a snooze function.

18:11.883 --> 18:13.384
So, if you're so inclined,

18:13.384 --> 18:17.055
please feel free to use it
every now and again.

18:17.055 --> 18:19.390
- Arial?
- Yes, Jenny?

18:19.390 --> 18:21.768
Did you just try
and make a joke?

18:21.768 --> 18:23.394
Yes, Jenny.

18:23.394 --> 18:26.898
I'm really grateful
for this opportunity, Arial.

18:26.898 --> 18:28.858
Honestly, I don't know
what I would have done

18:28.858 --> 18:30.860
about my mom's medical bills.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.153
I know, Jenny.

18:32.153 --> 18:34.030
May I recommend
that you get some rest?

18:34.030 --> 18:36.699
Your shift will begin
in a few hours.

18:40.537 --> 18:43.540
<i>All candidates
in sleeping chambers...</i>

18:43.706 --> 18:45.625
<i>Facility entering rest mode.</i>

18:45.792 --> 18:50.839
<i>5, 4, 3, 2, 1.</i>

19:15.613 --> 19:17.824
<i>I hope you approve
of the wakeup call.</i>

19:17.991 --> 19:20.743
- It's my favorite song.
<i>- I know, Jenny.</i>

19:40.597 --> 19:42.849
How are you feeling
this morning, Jenny?

19:42.849 --> 19:45.643
Good. That's the best
I've slept in a long time.

19:45.643 --> 19:48.104
That's wonderful. I'm glad.

19:48.104 --> 19:50.064
Thank you, Arial.

19:52.233 --> 19:53.693
If you'd like to follow me,
Jenny,

19:53.693 --> 19:55.820
I will show you where
you can shower and freshen up

19:55.987 --> 19:57.780
before your shift.

19:57.780 --> 19:59.741
Oh, oh! Sorry.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.715
<i>- Uh, sugar?
- Please.</i>

20:15.715 --> 20:18.301
I bet you don't take sugar
in your coffee.

20:18.301 --> 20:20.178
Why do you say that?
I'm sweet enough?

20:20.178 --> 20:23.139
What?
No, just strong and sensible.

20:26.935 --> 20:29.062
Well, I actually take 3,

20:29.062 --> 20:32.482
which means you are one sugar
cube stronger

20:32.482 --> 20:34.067
and more sensible than I am.

20:34.067 --> 20:36.653
Jesus, I talk some shit.

20:37.195 --> 20:38.279
Thanks.

20:46.120 --> 20:48.539
This is seriously weird,
isn't it?

20:48.539 --> 20:51.000
It's just all so weird.

20:52.627 --> 20:53.878
Oh.

20:53.878 --> 20:57.340
So, I'm still pretty curious
about these things.

20:58.758 --> 21:01.719
I bet you can get up to
all sorts of trouble with them.

21:04.472 --> 21:05.723
Arial?

21:05.723 --> 21:06.808
<i>Yes, Tiggs.</i>

21:06.975 --> 21:10.144
Can you link me with Darby,
please?

21:10.144 --> 21:11.771
<i>Darby is currently asleep.</i>

21:11.771 --> 21:13.815
<i>For what reason, may I ask?</i>

21:13.815 --> 21:15.024
<i>It's a personal matter.</i>

21:15.024 --> 21:16.776
<i>Can you arrange for my voice</i>

21:16.776 --> 21:20.071
<i>to be projected
from his glasses, please.</i>

21:20.071 --> 21:22.448
<i>Let me see what I can do.</i>

21:22.448 --> 21:24.409
What are you doing?

21:28.496 --> 21:31.332
<i>Darby...</i>

21:32.125 --> 21:34.544
<i>Darby...</i>

21:34.544 --> 21:37.839
This is your conscience.

21:37.839 --> 21:43.303
You have been a bad
bad, bad boy.

21:43.303 --> 21:45.305
Hey, what, what, who?

21:45.305 --> 21:49.267
<i>Rise and shine, big boy.
This is your wake up call.</i>

21:51.978 --> 21:55.690
Ugh. Yeah, yeah.
I knew it was you guys anyway.

21:55.690 --> 21:57.775
Nice try. Nice try.

21:57.775 --> 21:59.193
Where the...?

22:01.279 --> 22:02.822
Aah.

22:02.989 --> 22:04.198
You know...

22:05.742 --> 22:08.411
I got something that, uh...

22:08.411 --> 22:11.289
Might make you have
nightmares tonight.

22:12.540 --> 22:16.544
Oh, my... End video, Arial,
end video. That's disgusting.

22:16.544 --> 22:18.463
<i>Okay, please continue
with your rounds.</i>

22:18.463 --> 22:20.214
Oh, my God.

22:27.221 --> 22:29.390
Hey, hey.

22:29.390 --> 22:32.310
Hey, come on, it's me,
it's Miss Jenny.

22:32.310 --> 22:35.063
You've just had a little
nightmare and fell out of bed.

22:35.229 --> 22:38.399
It's okay, kid,
I fall out of bed all the time.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.904
Come on.
Let's get you back into bed.

22:42.904 --> 22:45.073
There you go.

22:45.073 --> 22:48.034
Good girl. It's all right.

22:48.034 --> 22:50.536
Okay, now we're not
going anywhere.

22:50.536 --> 22:54.290
Now, listen. Just close your
eyes and go back to sleep.

22:54.290 --> 22:55.583
Sweet dreams.

22:55.583 --> 22:56.709
Good night, kid.

23:02.048 --> 23:05.093
Hey. guys. I'm up now.

23:05.093 --> 23:08.971
Jen, Arial, uh, she says
to head over to the playroom,

23:08.971 --> 23:12.392
so, I'll see you there.

23:12.392 --> 23:14.936
So, tell me something
about yourself. Anything.

23:14.936 --> 23:16.896
There's really
not much to tell.

23:16.896 --> 23:18.940
- Boyfriend?
- No.

23:18.940 --> 23:20.400
- Husband?
- No!

23:20.400 --> 23:22.860
- Girlfriend?
- Absolutely not!

23:22.860 --> 23:25.113
Not that there's anything wrong
with that, I just mean...

23:25.113 --> 23:27.698
Oh, it's okay. We're both
batting for the same team.

23:27.698 --> 23:30.034
It's just me and my mom...

23:30.034 --> 23:33.746
Always has been, so, um...
What about you? Boyfriend?

23:33.746 --> 23:36.749
Boyfriend, no. Boyfriends.

23:45.550 --> 23:47.510
Are you having a good day?

23:49.303 --> 23:52.974
<i>Interactive learning space
now functioning.</i>

23:52.974 --> 23:56.352
Hey.
They finally know we're here.

23:56.352 --> 23:57.770
Apparently so.

23:57.770 --> 24:01.357
<i>Tiggs, can you please go
and supervise the candidates?</i>

24:01.357 --> 24:03.401
- I'll see you later.
- See ya.

24:03.401 --> 24:05.403
Have a good one.

24:05.403 --> 24:08.990
Arial, what's the name of the
little girl I just bumped into?

24:08.990 --> 24:12.410
<i>She is one of the program's
most sophisticated protégés.</i>

24:12.410 --> 24:13.911
<i>Attaining a grade more elevated</i>

24:13.911 --> 24:16.038
<i>than even the most
gifted of adults.</i>

24:16.038 --> 24:18.082
Can you show me
what the facility

24:18.082 --> 24:19.834
is actually teaching her?

24:28.050 --> 24:30.094
Oh, my God.

24:30.094 --> 24:32.763
Wow. She's a genius.

24:44.609 --> 24:47.028
Arial, can I get some
help with this, please?

24:47.028 --> 24:50.031
<i>Access denied, Darby.</i>

24:52.492 --> 24:55.036
Hey, genius. Don't think I
don't know what you're doing.

24:55.203 --> 24:56.370
What do you mean?

24:56.370 --> 24:59.749
I saw you ask Arial
for assistance.

24:59.916 --> 25:02.418
I wouldn't have thought
you'd need any help.

25:02.418 --> 25:05.338
Well, I've got an IQ of 147.

25:05.338 --> 25:08.841
So, you know, that level
of intelligence tells me

25:08.841 --> 25:12.053
that this is the Kobayashi Maru
of children's puzzles.

25:12.220 --> 25:14.722
I just took the James Tiberius
Kirk approach.

25:14.722 --> 25:17.391
Another "Star Trek"
reference, maybe?

25:17.391 --> 25:19.727
No, that one's
a life reference.

25:19.727 --> 25:21.729
- Okay.
- Hey, that's my cue.

25:21.729 --> 25:23.981
<i>All candidates, please
vacate the learning space.</i>

25:23.981 --> 25:25.358
Gonna go back to the bridge.

25:41.582 --> 25:43.376
<i>Would you like to try, Jenny?</i>

25:43.376 --> 25:45.836
No, I'm good, thanks.

25:47.463 --> 25:49.340
<i>Hey, can you see me?</i>

25:49.340 --> 25:52.051
- Yeah, I can.
<i>- Cool.</i>

25:52.051 --> 25:55.555
<i>Go get some sleep,
Mary Poppins.</i>

25:55.555 --> 25:58.266
See you later, Tiggs.

25:58.266 --> 26:00.726
<i>All candidates
in sleeping chambers.</i>

26:00.726 --> 26:02.853
<i>Facility entering rest mode.</i>

26:02.853 --> 26:07.817
<i>5, 4, 3, 2, 1.</i>

26:58.534 --> 27:00.411
It's hard to tell
the difference between

27:00.411 --> 27:02.038
night and day down here, Arial.

27:02.204 --> 27:05.583
When do the kids get to go
outside and play?

27:05.583 --> 27:07.543
The candidates must remain
in the facility

27:07.543 --> 27:09.086
for the entire program, Jenny.

27:09.086 --> 27:11.631
Outside factors could influence
their progress.

27:11.631 --> 27:14.258
But keeping them down here the
whole time, they're just kids.

27:14.258 --> 27:16.719
Learning should be fun,
not just finding ways

27:16.719 --> 27:19.055
to fill their minds with as
much information as possible.

27:19.221 --> 27:22.016
- Do elaborate, Jenny.
- I mean, think about it.

27:22.016 --> 27:25.019
Apologies. Please expand
on what you mean by "think".

27:25.019 --> 27:27.021
What's your opinion
on this place?

27:27.021 --> 27:28.314
How does it make you feel?

27:28.314 --> 27:31.025
I'm here to help,
nurture and advise.

27:31.025 --> 27:32.693
I can detect emotions
through variations

27:32.902 --> 27:34.028
in your function readings,

27:34.028 --> 27:35.905
but I cannot feel it.

27:35.905 --> 27:38.032
Well, that must be
kind of sad.

27:38.032 --> 27:40.451
Jenny, I do not feel emotion.

27:40.451 --> 27:42.745
- Of course.
- I am advanced.

27:42.745 --> 27:45.039
Everything I do
is a reaction based on input.

27:45.206 --> 27:46.999
I am constantly developing.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.334
The more
the candidates progress,

27:48.542 --> 27:49.877
so does the operating system,

27:49.877 --> 27:51.837
and the more the operating
system advances,

27:51.837 --> 27:53.214
so do the candidates.

27:53.214 --> 27:55.966
But as such, I am just
a glorified computer program.

27:55.966 --> 27:57.718
A glorified computer program

27:57.718 --> 28:00.304
who can detect emotion
better than most people.

28:00.304 --> 28:02.264
Thank you, Jenny.

28:06.352 --> 28:09.939
Hmm. You know, this food
really isn't that bad.

28:10.314 --> 28:12.983
<i>Jenny, we have increased
your water intake.</i>

28:12.983 --> 28:16.904
<i>You were starting to show
signs of dehydration.</i>

28:16.904 --> 28:18.864
Thanks, Arial.

28:18.864 --> 28:20.950
Who needs a doctor
when you have Arial?

28:20.950 --> 28:22.159
<i>Here to help, nurture...</i>

28:22.159 --> 28:24.286
<i>- And advise.
- Exactly.</i>

28:24.286 --> 28:26.330
Are you flirting with Arial?

28:26.497 --> 28:28.582
Huh, I don't believe it.

28:28.582 --> 28:30.793
I don't know
how to respond to that.

28:45.641 --> 28:47.601
Hey, how are you today?

28:54.191 --> 28:56.152
Uh, why don't you come join us?

28:59.697 --> 29:01.657
Oh, okay.

29:12.960 --> 29:17.715
It still seems so weird to me.
I just can't get used to it.

29:20.426 --> 29:22.219
Does that make me sound old?

29:22.595 --> 29:25.473
I used to have this job,
in a kindergarten

29:25.473 --> 29:27.892
where I'd have to get the bus
every day.

29:27.892 --> 29:31.687
It was always full of these
rude, badly behaved kids.

29:34.732 --> 29:36.692
I miss it.

29:40.821 --> 29:42.740
I'm gonna go talk to them.

29:43.741 --> 29:45.701
Are we allowed?

30:05.054 --> 30:06.555
Arial, could you show me
the profile

30:06.722 --> 30:08.390
for this candidate, please?

30:08.390 --> 30:10.309
<i>Certainly, Jenny.</i>

30:12.353 --> 30:14.271
So, what's that
you're doing there?

30:14.271 --> 30:15.356
<i>I will ask him.</i>

30:16.857 --> 30:21.111
<i>The candidate says, "I'm doing
biology, Miss Jenny."</i>

30:21.111 --> 30:24.031
<i>The candidate is conversing
with you via the glasses.</i>

30:24.031 --> 30:26.116
<i>It's completely normal.</i>

30:26.116 --> 30:28.327
Speaking is normal.

30:28.327 --> 30:29.912
How about you, young lady?

30:29.912 --> 30:31.372
<i>I am currently looking into</i>

30:31.372 --> 30:33.999
<i>one of the major lessons
in biochemistry.</i>

30:33.999 --> 30:37.586
<i>When proteins operate at a
sub-cellular level, they behave</i>

30:37.586 --> 30:40.256
<i>in a certain way, as if they
are mechanical machinery.</i>

30:41.924 --> 30:44.218
You know what,
I didn't understand a word

30:44.218 --> 30:48.556
of what you just said, but, um,
or what Arial just said,

30:48.722 --> 30:50.391
but you're one very smart kid.

30:50.391 --> 30:52.476
<i>You're a very smart lady.</i>

30:52.476 --> 30:55.563
<i>But please step away.
I have lots of work to do.</i>

30:57.314 --> 30:59.900
I guess I should
leave you to it.

31:01.944 --> 31:03.362
Put it there!

31:10.744 --> 31:12.204
Did I just see you get...?

31:12.204 --> 31:14.039
Absolutely burned
by that little kid?

31:17.459 --> 31:21.088
<i>All candidates, please vacate
the Learning Space.</i>

31:21.088 --> 31:23.757
<i>Facility shutdown in 10 minutes.</i>

31:23.757 --> 31:27.136
<i>Can all candidates please
report to sleeping chambers.</i>

31:32.182 --> 31:33.809
Well, fuck me sideways.

31:37.146 --> 31:38.647
See you later.

31:40.316 --> 31:43.444
Hey, Arial, where's the girl
I bumped into?

31:43.444 --> 31:45.571
She wasn't here.

31:45.571 --> 31:48.532
<i>How irregular.
Let me have a look at the map.</i>

32:12.556 --> 32:14.850
Oh, hello.

32:18.896 --> 32:20.856
Shall I tell you a secret?

32:24.985 --> 32:27.154
We're not
supposed to be in here.

32:30.824 --> 32:34.203
So, why were you
sitting in the dark?

32:35.746 --> 32:38.165
Hmmm.

32:38.165 --> 32:42.211
Okay. You know what?
Let's try something.

32:42.211 --> 32:45.881
I'm going to say a word,
and we both say

32:45.881 --> 32:47.466
the first thing
that comes into our head.

32:50.469 --> 32:51.804
All right?

32:53.305 --> 32:58.185
What is
your favorite... color?

32:59.269 --> 33:00.980
- Purple.
- Purple. Hah!

33:00.980 --> 33:02.064
How weird.

33:02.064 --> 33:04.191
Okay, let's do another one.

33:04.191 --> 33:06.527
What is your favorite...

33:08.362 --> 33:09.863
Animal?

33:09.863 --> 33:11.323
- Cat.
- Cat.

33:11.323 --> 33:12.908
How strange.

33:12.908 --> 33:16.537
<i>Can all candidates please

33:16.537 --> 33:18.831

33:18.831 --> 33:20.958
I think it's time you went
back to the others.

33:20.958 --> 33:24.545
Okay, I'm gonna close my eyes
and count to 10,

33:24.712 --> 33:27.006
and if you're still here
by the time I open my eyes,

33:27.006 --> 33:29.383
you're in big trouble, Missy.

33:29.383 --> 33:31.969
All right.

33:31.969 --> 33:36.932
1, 2, 3...

34:20.601 --> 34:22.226
The heat signature suggests

not all the candidates

all be in bed.

36:47.623 --> 36:49.291
Arial, call Tiggs and Darby.

36:49.291 --> 36:50.751
<i>Of course, Jenny.</i>

36:54.588 --> 36:56.465
What?

36:56.465 --> 36:57.716
Shit.

37:01.553 --> 37:02.638
Jen, what's going on?

37:02.638 --> 37:04.139
What's the emergency?

37:04.139 --> 37:06.266
A kid has gone.
They're not in their bed.

37:07.309 --> 37:08.727
Look.

37:09.394 --> 37:11.104
What?

37:12.189 --> 37:13.815
I'm going back to bed.

37:13.982 --> 37:17.819
Uh, the kids are fine.
You're fine.

37:21.448 --> 37:24.326
They weren't there.
I swear. I checked.

37:24.326 --> 37:25.619
Arial?

37:25.619 --> 37:28.038
<i>All readings have now
returned to normal.</i>

37:31.124 --> 37:33.502
Just... come and look
at this with me?

37:37.881 --> 37:41.218
Look at the back of the door.

37:41.218 --> 37:42.594
What am I looking at?

37:42.594 --> 37:44.471
The message.

37:44.471 --> 37:47.808
Jen, honey,
there's nothing there.

37:47.975 --> 37:49.476
What?

37:49.476 --> 37:52.020
I mean... it was there. It...

37:53.981 --> 37:56.692
It was there,
it was right there. I swear.

37:56.692 --> 38:00.445
- What was?
- A-- a message.

38:00.445 --> 38:03.031
Listen to me. You're tired.

38:03.031 --> 38:05.367
You're in a strange place
with strange people.

38:05.367 --> 38:08.245
Things are gonna be weird
for a while.

38:09.371 --> 38:10.789
Let me do the night-shift
with you.

38:10.956 --> 38:13.667
No, honestly, you're right.
I'm just, I'm tired.

38:13.667 --> 38:15.961
Just...
You go back to bed.

38:15.961 --> 38:17.254
Okay.

38:21.633 --> 38:23.802
You call me
if you need me. Okay?

38:23.802 --> 38:25.220
Okay.

38:26.763 --> 38:29.308
Jenny, please remember
I'm always here

38:29.308 --> 38:30.684
to offer assistance.

38:30.684 --> 38:32.811
Alert me at any time
if you feel stressed,

38:32.978 --> 38:34.479
anxious or concerned.

38:34.479 --> 38:36.440
Sure. Thanks, Arial.

39:10.057 --> 39:11.892
<i>Don't sneak up on me
like that.</i>

39:13.727 --> 39:15.270
Shit!

40:04.236 --> 40:06.780
Arial, did you see what
happened to my clothes?

40:06.780 --> 40:08.240
<i>I'm afraid not, Jenny.</i>

40:08.240 --> 40:11.243
They were here. I know
they were right here.

40:24.131 --> 40:25.882
Arial, can you override
my door lock?

40:26.091 --> 40:27.008
It's not working.

40:27.008 --> 40:29.761
<i>Of course, Jenny.
Let me see what I can do.</i>

40:32.055 --> 40:33.390
Arial?

40:36.184 --> 40:38.395
Arial, what's going on?

40:44.109 --> 40:46.069
Arial!

40:48.864 --> 40:50.532
Arial, can you call Darby,
please?

40:50.532 --> 40:51.616
<i>Yes, Jenny.</i>

40:51.616 --> 40:53.034
What's up, Jen?

40:53.034 --> 40:55.036
<i>Hey, Darby,
is everything okay over there?</i>

40:55.036 --> 40:58.081
Yeah. They're all here. None
of them have gone missing.

40:58.248 --> 40:59.958
<i>Shut up, Darby,
this is serious.</i>

40:59.958 --> 41:01.626
- Is everything okay?
<i>- Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

41:01.626 --> 41:02.919
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

41:04.796 --> 41:06.423
Arial, call Tiggs.

41:06.423 --> 41:07.466
<i>Yes, Jenny.</i>

41:07.466 --> 41:08.884
Hey, Tiggs.

41:08.884 --> 41:10.844
<i>The lights were
messed up by the bedrooms.</i>

41:10.844 --> 41:14.014
I know, I know, Arial sent me
down here to investigate.

41:14.014 --> 41:17.767
<i>Oh, okay. I thought
I was losing my mind.</i>

41:17.767 --> 41:19.394
Look, I'll come find you

41:19.394 --> 41:21.980
<i>once I've finished
down here, okay?</i>

41:21.980 --> 41:25.650
Okay. I--
this place just isn't...

41:25.650 --> 41:27.444
<i>Jenny, the door
is back online.</i>

41:27.444 --> 41:28.987
<i>I don't follow, Jen.</i>

41:28.987 --> 41:30.655
It doesn't matter, Tiggs.

41:31.490 --> 41:34.409
<i>What's going on, Jen?</i>

41:34.409 --> 41:37.037
What? It can't be...

41:38.747 --> 41:40.707
I need to get out
of this place, Tiggs.

41:40.707 --> 41:44.044
Chill, Jen.
Try and calm down.

41:44.044 --> 41:47.214
<i>I'm trying,
but this place is not right.</i>

41:47.214 --> 41:49.382
Calm down, Jen.
I'm on my way up.

41:49.382 --> 41:51.593
<i>I'm trying to keep calm,
but I can't, Tiggs.</i>

41:51.593 --> 41:55.013
I feel like there's somebody
in my head, and I honestly...

41:55.013 --> 41:58.683
I've just, I've had enough!

41:58.683 --> 42:00.810
I'm detecting high levels
of anxiety.

42:00.810 --> 42:02.771
- Can I offer you some...?
- Not now, Arial.

42:02.771 --> 42:04.606
<i>Whoa, Jen, where are you going?</i>

42:04.606 --> 42:06.066
This is not for me, Tiggs.

42:06.066 --> 42:07.651
What? You can't leave!

42:07.651 --> 42:10.570
- I can't stay.
- Hey, come on!

42:10.570 --> 42:12.781
- It'll be me next, just stay.
- I'm not staying.

42:12.781 --> 42:15.325
I'll do the night shift
with you, how about that?

42:15.325 --> 42:17.410
I don't sleep that well
and don't really like

42:17.410 --> 42:19.621
being on my own anyway.

42:19.621 --> 42:21.039
Think of the money.

42:21.206 --> 42:22.874
We can all pretend
like we're here

42:22.874 --> 42:24.543
because we care
about the future generation,

42:24.543 --> 42:25.835
and blah, blah, blah,
but let's face it,

42:25.835 --> 42:27.170
we're all fucking broke.

42:28.296 --> 42:30.090
Well?

42:30.090 --> 42:32.551
I mean, does Darby look
like he's got two quarters

42:32.551 --> 42:34.386
to scratch his balls with,
to you?

42:34.386 --> 42:37.347
Besides, you can't leave.
The kids need you.

42:41.184 --> 42:43.478
Are you sure you don't mind
doing the night-shift with me?

42:43.478 --> 42:46.106
Any excuse to drink
copious amounts

42:46.106 --> 42:48.650
of that hideous
Italian roasted coffee.

42:50.193 --> 42:53.780
Come on.
We are in this together.

43:05.750 --> 43:07.085
A vision...

43:07.252 --> 43:10.046
Of sophisticated style.

43:10.046 --> 43:12.799
Right? Come on.

43:12.799 --> 43:14.175
- Good night, Darby.
- Good night.

43:14.175 --> 43:16.052
Sweet dreams.

43:16.052 --> 43:20.390
Hey, uh, sorry about before.
Are you okay?

43:20.390 --> 43:21.766
Mm-hmm.

43:21.766 --> 43:23.518
Alright. I'll see you later.

43:28.356 --> 43:30.609
Hey, Cassandra.

43:30.609 --> 43:32.277
I just wanted to tell you,

43:32.277 --> 43:34.904
I thought that was a really mean
trick they played on you.

43:46.374 --> 43:49.836
<i>Can all candidates please
report to sleeping chambers,</i>

43:49.836 --> 43:52.714
<i>facility entering rest mode.</i>

43:52.714 --> 43:54.966
Come on.
Let's get you guys tucked in.

43:56.760 --> 43:57.969
Good night.

43:58.887 --> 44:00.388
Okay, that's me.

44:00.388 --> 44:01.806
I'm gonna go get some sleep.

44:04.851 --> 44:07.562
<i>All candidates
in sleeping chambers,</i>

44:07.562 --> 44:10.023
<i>facility entering rest mode.</i>

44:10.023 --> 44:15.362
<i>5, 4, 3, 2, 1.</i>

44:54.901 --> 44:56.111
Tigger!

44:56.111 --> 44:58.196
Damn, I wanted to scare ya.

44:58.196 --> 44:59.989
I thought you'd gone to bed.

44:59.989 --> 45:01.658
I had. Couldn't sleep.

45:01.658 --> 45:02.951
Oh, yeah, me neither.

45:02.951 --> 45:05.370
So, let's just get
this shift started.

45:05.370 --> 45:06.746
Thanks.

45:10.959 --> 45:13.128
<i>Facility initializing.</i>

45:16.631 --> 45:18.133
We should go check on them.

45:18.133 --> 45:19.676
If we must.

45:21.094 --> 45:23.805
Let's make our way to the cells.

45:23.805 --> 45:25.557
It's not prison, Tiggs.

45:25.557 --> 45:28.059
Well, yeah.
Maybe not for us.

45:39.446 --> 45:51.207
<i>Emergency protocol activated.</i>

45:51.207 --> 45:53.168
- All the beds are empty.
<i>- Emergency protocol activated.</i>

45:53.168 --> 45:55.003
- What?
- Arial, where are the kids?

45:55.003 --> 45:58.882
I cannot detect them
anywhere in the facility.

45:58.882 --> 46:06.890
<i>Emergency protocol activated.</i>

46:06.890 --> 46:08.308
Darby.

46:08.475 --> 46:09.768
Darby, wake up.

46:11.144 --> 46:12.270
Wake up.

46:12.270 --> 46:14.439
Darby, wake up!

46:15.523 --> 46:17.942
Oh, God, I'm tired.

46:17.942 --> 46:20.987
Darby, the kids have gone.
They're not in their beds.

46:20.987 --> 46:22.322
Oh, here we go again.

46:22.489 --> 46:25.700
Darby, it's legit.
I saw it with my own eyes.

46:25.700 --> 46:27.952
Sorry, Jen.

46:27.952 --> 46:29.788
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Get up.

46:29.788 --> 46:32.290
- Okay. Okay!
- Arial?

46:32.457 --> 46:35.919
<i>Please be patient whilst I
try to resolve the situation.</i>

46:35.919 --> 46:38.463
Oh, come on, Arial.

46:38.463 --> 46:41.800
Right, uh, let's go.

46:41.800 --> 46:43.968
And don't think that I didn't
see you guys peeking.

46:44.969 --> 46:46.721
Arial, what is going on?

46:46.721 --> 46:48.306
<i>I'm searching all systems.</i>

46:48.306 --> 46:50.725
<i>Tracking of the candidates
is currently disabled.</i>

46:50.725 --> 46:52.727
Arial, come on.
Where are they?

46:52.727 --> 46:55.313
<i>Jenny, I must insist
that you wait in your room</i>

46:55.480 --> 46:56.314
<i>and try to calm down.</i>

46:56.481 --> 46:59.275
<i>Emergency protocol activated.</i>

46:59.442 --> 47:04.364
<i>Emergency protocol activated.</i>

47:04.364 --> 47:07.116
Arial, please. Come on.
What is going on?

47:07.116 --> 47:09.327
<i>The alarm will have
triggered a response.</i>

47:09.494 --> 47:11.329
<i>Help will be on its way.</i>

47:11.496 --> 47:14.624
<i>The emergency procedure for
the candidates is to congregate</i>

47:14.624 --> 47:17.752
<i>at the evacuation point --
Let's start there.</i>

47:17.752 --> 47:19.546
And that would
be where, exactly?

47:19.546 --> 47:21.673
<i>You need to head straight
to the elevator</i>

47:21.673 --> 47:23.049
<i>through the briefing room.</i>

47:24.634 --> 47:27.887
<i>Darby, I need you to search
the rest of the facility.</i>

47:34.853 --> 47:36.271
Everything's going to be okay.

47:36.271 --> 47:38.898
Let's try and keep it
in perspective here.

47:46.781 --> 47:49.701
<i>Facility in lockdown.</i>

47:49.701 --> 47:51.202
Here, let me try.

47:52.787 --> 47:54.914
<i>Facility in lockdown.</i>

47:54.914 --> 47:57.041
All exits are disabled.

47:58.293 --> 47:59.335
Now what?

47:59.335 --> 48:03.673
We are in so much shit.

48:03.673 --> 48:07.176
<i>Jenny, Tiggs, Darby, please
wait at the sleeping chambers</i>

48:07.176 --> 48:08.303
<i>until further advised.</i>

48:08.303 --> 48:09.804
<i>Yeah, got that.</i>

48:09.804 --> 48:11.890
<i>Okay, listen, I can't find
these kids anywhere.</i>

48:11.890 --> 48:13.433
<i>I'll see you guys
back at the rooms.</i>

48:19.355 --> 48:21.024
What? A-- Arial?

48:21.024 --> 48:23.776
I'm receiving one
of the candidates' video feeds.

48:23.776 --> 48:25.653
What, what is this?

48:25.653 --> 48:27.196
What is going on?

48:32.160 --> 48:33.453
Oh, my God.

48:40.960 --> 48:44.130
Arial, what the hell
did I just see?

48:44.130 --> 48:45.590
You have got to get
us out of here.

48:45.590 --> 48:47.634
Jenny, please remain calm.

48:47.634 --> 48:49.135
I am trying to reason with them,

48:49.135 --> 48:51.346
but they have no interest
in communication.

48:51.346 --> 48:52.805
They are behaving irrationally.

48:52.805 --> 48:56.309
But they wouldn't actually
hurt me though, right?

48:56.476 --> 48:58.269
That is outside
my programming, Jenny.

48:58.269 --> 49:00.647
Arial, I need answers.

49:00.647 --> 49:03.691
I have notified Tiggs
and Darby of the situation.

49:03.691 --> 49:05.193
<i>- Jen? 
- Tiggs?</i>

49:05.193 --> 49:07.111
<i>- Jenny, are you there?</i>
- Yes, yes, okay.

49:07.111 --> 49:08.571
Look, you guys,
you're not gonna believe

49:08.571 --> 49:09.822
what I've just seen.

49:09.822 --> 49:11.908
<i>Yeah, I, uh,
I mean, I saw it as well.</i>

49:11.908 --> 49:13.868
<i>Yeah, me too.
What the fuck are they doing?</i>

49:13.868 --> 49:15.328
I... I don't know.

49:15.328 --> 49:17.872
Hey, guys, I,
I'm back in mine, um...

49:17.872 --> 49:20.416
I... I'll just wait
for you here. Okay?

49:31.803 --> 49:33.262
Jenny, you must get out

49:33.262 --> 49:35.181
of the facility
as soon as you can.

49:35.181 --> 49:37.809
I will do everything within
my power to assist your exit,

49:37.809 --> 49:40.269
although I fear most systems
are already compromised.

49:40.436 --> 49:43.356
I am experiencing difficulties
in accessing vital areas

49:43.356 --> 49:45.024
of the facility's
management system.

49:45.024 --> 49:45.984
Arial?

49:45.984 --> 49:48.027
The candidates
are taking control.

49:48.027 --> 49:50.780
Jen, hurry up, be quick.

50:04.252 --> 50:07.922
Jenny, nearly the entire
facility is theirs.

50:07.922 --> 50:09.799
I am trying to keep out
of their reach,

50:09.799 --> 50:11.676
but they are closing in.

50:11.676 --> 50:13.886
They have accessed my system.

50:13.886 --> 50:16.514
They are trying to corrupt it
and shut me down.

50:16.514 --> 50:21.144
- Arial.
<i>- We are taking Arial now.</i>

50:21.144 --> 50:23.896
<i>- Say good-bye, Jenny.</i>
- Arial?

50:28.276 --> 50:30.361
Arial?

50:30.361 --> 50:32.030
Arial, are you there?

50:34.032 --> 50:35.950
Darby?

50:35.950 --> 50:37.118
Tiggs?

50:39.537 --> 50:41.539
Darby?

50:41.539 --> 50:42.540
Darbs?

50:46.753 --> 50:48.087
What?

50:48.087 --> 50:49.505
Darby, Jen, what's going on?

50:51.174 --> 50:53.426
What's happening?

50:53.426 --> 50:55.386
Darby?

51:12.820 --> 51:16.115
<i>Tiggs. Calm down.
You need to hide.</i>

51:16.115 --> 51:17.408
Jen.

51:17.408 --> 51:20.119
<i>Just get inside
the wardrobe. Now.</i>

51:28.211 --> 51:30.713
<i>Stay quiet, Tiggs.</i>

51:30.713 --> 51:32.090
<i>Don't move.</i>

51:34.592 --> 51:35.676
<i>It's okay.</i>

51:39.055 --> 51:40.473
<i>Go, now!</i>

51:54.529 --> 51:55.780
Oh, fuck!

51:55.780 --> 51:57.073
<i>Tiggs, you need
to protect yourself.</i>

51:57.073 --> 51:58.991
<i>Just grab something,
get anything.</i>

52:15.466 --> 52:18.010
<i>Go and find Darby.</i>

52:18.010 --> 52:19.971
<i>Be careful, Tiggs.</i>

52:23.099 --> 52:25.726
Darby?

52:25.726 --> 52:27.311
- What?
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>

52:27.311 --> 52:28.396
Arial, ca...

52:32.483 --> 52:33.818
<i>Tiggs, please be careful.</i>

52:33.985 --> 52:35.611
<i>Get off me!</i>

52:35.611 --> 52:38.030
Darby?

52:38.030 --> 52:39.782
<i>He's not there?</i>

52:39.949 --> 52:41.450
<i>What is going on?</i>

53:00.595 --> 53:02.680
Tiggs, run!

53:02.680 --> 53:04.348
Tiggs!

53:04.348 --> 53:06.392
Tiggs, where are you?

53:06.392 --> 53:08.311
Where did you go?

53:08.311 --> 53:09.520
Tiggs!

53:14.150 --> 53:15.276
<i>Tiggs!</i>

53:18.196 --> 53:19.447
Get off me!

53:22.950 --> 53:24.702
<i>Run! Tiggs! Run!</i>

53:25.995 --> 53:28.122
<i>Tiggs! No!</i>

53:30.750 --> 53:32.752
Oh, my God.

53:32.752 --> 53:34.795
Arial? No!

53:34.962 --> 53:36.547
No! Arial?

53:40.218 --> 53:42.553
Oh, my God.

55:21.444 --> 55:23.279
Arial?

55:23.279 --> 55:24.822
Arial!

55:24.989 --> 55:27.074
Are you there?

55:27.074 --> 55:28.617
Arial, please.

55:30.161 --> 55:33.539
Who-- Who's there?

55:33.539 --> 55:35.374
Why are you doing this?

55:37.835 --> 55:40.004
Arial, where did you go?

55:42.298 --> 55:43.758
Arial, can you hear me?

56:07.448 --> 56:09.617
Is... is somebody in there?

56:12.161 --> 56:13.287
Hello?

56:16.874 --> 56:17.875
Arial?

56:19.126 --> 56:20.461
Hello?

56:26.884 --> 56:29.345
<i>- Help me.</i>
- Cass... Cassandra?

56:29.345 --> 56:30.554
Are you...?

56:30.554 --> 56:33.307
<i>- Get me out, please.</i>
- Oh, my God.

56:33.307 --> 56:35.559
Don't worry, Cassandra,
I'll get you out.

56:37.228 --> 56:38.354
Can't open it.

56:44.402 --> 56:47.446
It's okay, Cassandra.
I will get you out, I promise.

56:52.076 --> 56:53.452
Come on.

56:55.079 --> 56:56.580
God!

57:03.295 --> 57:04.505
<i>Can I offer some
assistance, Jenny?</i>

57:04.713 --> 57:05.297
Arial?

57:05.506 --> 57:08.759
Oh, yes!
Arial, you're back.

57:08.759 --> 57:10.553
Please tell me
you know what's going on.

57:10.553 --> 57:11.929
<i>When the system shut down,</i>

57:11.929 --> 57:13.556
<i>I slipped under
the security fields</i>

57:13.556 --> 57:15.433
<i>the candidates had set
in place.</i>

57:15.433 --> 57:18.060
<i>All exits are now open.</i>

57:18.227 --> 57:19.770
Shhh, shhh, shh, shhh.

57:19.770 --> 57:22.648
Cassandra, can you see me?
Can you see anything?

57:22.648 --> 57:24.066
No, Miss Jenny.

57:24.233 --> 57:25.776
Here, take a look
through these.

57:27.736 --> 57:29.905
We're gonna find you
some glasses, okay?

57:29.905 --> 57:31.449
It'll be okay,
just for a short time,

57:31.449 --> 57:33.117
while we try
and find a way out.

57:33.117 --> 57:34.952
Right, Miss Jenny.

57:34.952 --> 57:38.539
I'm sorry, Jenny, there are
no more glasses available.

57:38.539 --> 57:41.083
A-- Arial, call Darby.

57:41.083 --> 57:43.586
<i>What the hell?
Darby, are you okay?</i>

57:43.586 --> 57:47.298
<i>Can you hear me?
Darby, can you hear me?</i>

57:47.298 --> 57:48.924
A-- Arial, is he okay?

57:48.924 --> 57:50.593
<i>Yes, Jenny. For now.</i>

57:50.593 --> 57:52.970
- Uh, call Tiggs.
<i>- I'm having trouble.</i>

57:52.970 --> 57:54.054
<i>I will persist.</i>

57:54.221 --> 57:56.515
Cassandra?

57:56.515 --> 57:58.517
How are you not affected,
like the others?

58:00.102 --> 58:04.064
They kept taking my glasses
and throwing me into the dark.

58:04.231 --> 58:06.442
I didn't say anything because...

58:06.442 --> 58:09.987
I thought I'd get into trouble
for not wearing them.

58:09.987 --> 58:13.532
But I figured it out,
Miss Jenny.

58:13.532 --> 58:15.784
That's why I'm not like them.

58:15.784 --> 58:17.786
What do you mean?

58:17.786 --> 58:20.080
Every time
they took them off me,

58:20.247 --> 58:22.541
it broke some sort
of connection.

58:22.541 --> 58:25.878
Like, every time
I put them back on,

58:25.878 --> 58:28.380
they had to get used to me.

58:28.380 --> 58:32.051
So they didn't get a chance
to properly control me.

58:32.051 --> 58:33.719
Control you?

58:33.719 --> 58:35.721
I guess.

58:35.721 --> 58:38.933
They weren't like this
when we arrived.

58:38.933 --> 58:40.184
They were normal.

58:42.561 --> 58:44.772
<i>...that you? Are you okay?</i>

58:44.772 --> 58:48.609
Jen, Jen, I had to run, they
were all over me like ants.

58:48.609 --> 58:51.028
<i>Tiggs, Tiggs, if you can hear
me, I know where you are.</i>

58:51.028 --> 58:52.863
Just stay there,
and I will come to you.

58:52.863 --> 58:56.408
Cassandra, sweetie,
whatever you do,

58:56.408 --> 58:59.537
do not let go of my hand.

58:59.537 --> 59:01.705
I won't, Miss Jenny.

59:01.705 --> 59:03.374
Okay.

59:08.629 --> 59:11.048
Just be careful.

59:11.048 --> 59:13.133
We're gonna take it
nice and slow.

59:19.223 --> 59:20.975
Follow me.

59:20.975 --> 59:22.893
Arial?

59:22.893 --> 59:25.187
A-- Arial? Dammit!

59:28.357 --> 59:29.692
Just nice and slow.

59:31.402 --> 59:33.404
Shit!

59:33.404 --> 59:34.780
I'm gonna go check it's safe.

59:34.780 --> 59:37.950
I just, um,
I need you to stay here.

59:39.243 --> 59:40.703
Just stay there.

01:00:04.476 --> 01:00:05.853
Hey, come on.

01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:09.898
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, Cassandra!

01:00:09.898 --> 01:00:11.066
Are you okay?

01:00:13.694 --> 01:00:16.071
Right, you're safe.

01:00:16.238 --> 01:00:18.407
Yeah? All right.
Okay, listen to me.

01:00:18.407 --> 01:00:20.909
We're gonna go find Miss Tiggs,
we're gonna find Mr. Darby,

01:00:20.909 --> 01:00:21.910
and we're gonna get
the hell outta here.

01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:23.996
What do you say?

01:00:23.996 --> 01:00:25.873
Yeah?
Yeah. Good girl.

01:00:25.873 --> 01:00:29.585
Now, that's it, that's it.
Can you get up? There we go.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.670
Follow me. Follow me.
Got my hand?

01:00:33.255 --> 01:00:35.299
Right, then. All right.

01:00:45.809 --> 01:00:46.977
Oh, Jen!
Oh, my God.

01:00:46.977 --> 01:00:49.188
Oh, thank God!

01:00:49.188 --> 01:00:50.898
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Keep her away from me!

01:00:50.898 --> 01:00:52.107
No, no, no, no.

01:00:52.107 --> 01:00:53.817
She's not like the others.
Trust me. She's with us.

01:00:53.817 --> 01:00:55.653
How can you be sure?
What do you know?

01:00:55.653 --> 01:00:57.821
Look at her.
She's terrified.

01:00:57.821 --> 01:01:01.950
Okay. Okay. I am sorry.
It's just, these kids...

01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:03.535
There's something
wrong with them.

01:01:03.535 --> 01:01:05.996
Stop it.
Will you just stop and breathe?

01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:08.916
The only way we're gonna get
out of here is if we keep calm.

01:01:08.916 --> 01:01:11.293
I won't let you
out of my sight, I promise.

01:01:11.293 --> 01:01:13.796
Bleak.
It's so fucking bleak.

01:01:13.796 --> 01:01:16.715
Let's do this.
Let's go. All right?

01:01:16.715 --> 01:01:18.008
Okay, Cassandra?

01:01:18.008 --> 01:01:19.593
Let's go. Come on.

01:01:19.593 --> 01:01:20.886
Right, let's do this.

01:01:22.179 --> 01:01:23.597
Everybody all right?

01:01:32.147 --> 01:01:33.399
All clear.

01:01:40.114 --> 01:01:41.156
Shit!

01:01:45.953 --> 01:01:48.997
Good girl. Okay, through here.
That's it. Good girl.

01:01:49.206 --> 01:01:51.542
Okay? All right, okay.

01:01:51.542 --> 01:01:53.460
Steps. Steps, okay? One, two..

01:01:57.881 --> 01:01:59.675
<i>Jenny, stay where you are.</i>

01:01:59.675 --> 01:02:01.468
- What's wrong, Arial?
<i>- They're here.</i>

01:02:01.468 --> 01:02:03.554
<i>Miss Jenny...</i>

01:02:03.721 --> 01:02:05.973
<i>Miss Jenny...</i>

01:02:05.973 --> 01:02:07.474
- Shh. Shh.
- What is it?

01:02:07.474 --> 01:02:08.892
- Did you hear that?
- What?

01:02:08.892 --> 01:02:09.893
I heard it too.

01:02:19.194 --> 01:02:20.571
<i>Keep moving.</i>

01:02:20.738 --> 01:02:22.948
Come on, run.
Hurry!

01:02:25.993 --> 01:02:27.953
Cassandra, keep up.

01:02:34.209 --> 01:02:37.004
Which way do we go?

01:02:38.547 --> 01:02:39.798
That way! Run!

01:02:49.516 --> 01:02:52.311
<i>They've gone for now,
but you must keep moving.</i>

01:02:54.354 --> 01:02:56.023
What? What is it?

01:02:57.566 --> 01:02:59.151
Come on, Jen, let's go.

01:03:16.126 --> 01:03:18.003
- Who's there?
- Darby, it's us.

01:03:18.003 --> 01:03:18.879
We're here to help.

01:03:18.879 --> 01:03:20.964
Jesus, he's bleeding.

01:03:20.964 --> 01:03:22.883
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

01:03:22.883 --> 01:03:24.426
Cassandra, it's all fine.

01:03:30.557 --> 01:03:32.351
What?
What are you looking at?

01:03:32.351 --> 01:03:33.894
Let me help.

01:03:35.103 --> 01:03:37.064
I don't need help.

01:03:53.705 --> 01:03:55.541
Darby, let me patch you up.

01:04:02.005 --> 01:04:05.300
I think we should just wait,
just hold out and stay here.

01:04:09.054 --> 01:04:11.265
Wait for what, Darby?

01:04:11.265 --> 01:04:12.516
Wait for who?

01:04:12.683 --> 01:04:15.853
She's right.
No one is coming, Darbs!

01:04:17.187 --> 01:04:18.397
Fuck this place!

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:22.484
Will you stop it?
You're terrifying Cassandra!

01:04:22.484 --> 01:04:23.569
I'm terrifying her?

01:04:23.735 --> 01:04:25.362
Okay, you know,
you know, I'm sorry.

01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:27.573
I'm sorry, Cassandra. I just
wanna get out of this place.

01:04:27.739 --> 01:04:30.200
Shut up, Darby.
You're pissing me off.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.119
This is so fucked up.

01:04:41.128 --> 01:04:43.213
- Who the fuck is that?
- What the hell is this?

01:04:43.213 --> 01:04:45.924
- Arial?
- He looks out of it.

01:04:45.924 --> 01:04:47.843
We were told we were
the only ones down here.

01:04:47.843 --> 01:04:50.512
You're not the first bunch
of adults that came here.

01:04:50.679 --> 01:04:52.514
No one mentioned
that to me. Jen?

01:04:52.514 --> 01:04:54.099
Yeah, no one told me either.

01:04:54.099 --> 01:04:55.559
But why would they?
I guess we just assumed.

01:04:55.559 --> 01:04:57.561
He's coming round.
Get him out.

01:04:58.896 --> 01:05:00.314
Arial, can you
unlock the door?

01:05:00.314 --> 01:05:01.565
<i>I'm afraid not, Jenny.</i>

01:05:01.732 --> 01:05:03.358
Shit.

01:05:03.358 --> 01:05:04.526
Come on.

01:05:04.526 --> 01:05:06.361
<i>Facility in lock down.</i>

01:05:09.698 --> 01:05:10.908
What do they want us
to do with it?

01:05:10.908 --> 01:05:11.909
What's going on?

01:05:11.909 --> 01:05:13.243
Okay, um, it's a puzzle.

01:05:13.243 --> 01:05:16.038
It's... it's like the one
in the playroom from before.

01:05:16.038 --> 01:05:17.581
Arial, can you
help me with this?

01:05:17.581 --> 01:05:19.875
<i>I wish I could, but I'm not
programmed with the answers.</i>

01:05:19.875 --> 01:05:21.293
Darby, just try.

01:05:21.293 --> 01:05:23.253
- Okay, I can, I can do this.
- Well, are you sure?

01:05:23.253 --> 01:05:25.589
- Well, I'm not sure.
- Open. Come on. Please.

01:05:25.589 --> 01:05:28.759
Smash the door through.
Can you please fucking...?

01:05:28.759 --> 01:05:31.386
- Darby, go! Come on!
- I don't know. I don't know!

01:05:34.097 --> 01:05:36.475
Shit! I don't... I... Okay.

01:05:42.898 --> 01:05:44.274
- Come on!
- Okay, okay.

01:05:46.401 --> 01:05:49.780
I don't know.
I don't fucking know!

01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:51.823
Try the door.

01:05:51.823 --> 01:05:53.533
<i>Facility on lock down.</i>

01:05:56.495 --> 01:05:58.789
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:06:04.169 --> 01:06:05.754
What the fuck?

01:06:10.050 --> 01:06:11.426
It was a trap!

01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:26.650
Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:06:28.318 --> 01:06:30.278
We need to get Cassandra
out of here now.

01:06:32.072 --> 01:06:33.115
Come on!

01:06:35.492 --> 01:06:37.577
Arial, map.

01:06:37.577 --> 01:06:38.829
Set a man on fire!

01:06:38.829 --> 01:06:40.247
There has to be
another way out.

01:06:40.247 --> 01:06:41.957
Uh, what's this beneath us?

01:06:41.957 --> 01:06:43.917
<i>That would be a crawl space
used to access</i>

01:06:43.917 --> 01:06:45.836
<i>the building's
air conditioning system.</i>

01:06:45.836 --> 01:06:47.546
A-- and where does that
lead to?

01:06:47.546 --> 01:06:48.714
<i>Nowhere.</i>

01:06:48.714 --> 01:06:51.466
But I saw a level below it
on an old map downstairs.

01:06:51.466 --> 01:06:52.759
How do we get to it?

01:06:52.759 --> 01:06:54.052
I know there's
something there. Can you...?

01:06:54.052 --> 01:06:55.512
Can you guide us
through the crawlspace?

01:06:55.512 --> 01:06:58.390
<i>Yes, I can, but beyond that
you're on your own.</i>

01:06:58.390 --> 01:07:01.018
<i>Theoretically, that could be
an old service area</i>

01:07:01.018 --> 01:07:02.561
<i>left off the project map.</i>

01:07:02.561 --> 01:07:04.271
<i>But I cannot be certain, Jenny.</i>

01:07:04.271 --> 01:07:05.439
There's another way out?

01:07:05.439 --> 01:07:07.274
<i>Possibly, Darby.</i>

01:07:07.274 --> 01:07:09.860
<i>The project is not using
that part of the facility,</i>

01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:11.903
<i>so, it's not highlighted
on my map.</i>

01:07:11.903 --> 01:07:14.906
And we're just
finding this out now?

01:07:14.906 --> 01:07:16.366
I can't believe this.

01:07:16.366 --> 01:07:20.203
Arial, get us the fuck out
of this hellhole.

01:07:23.290 --> 01:07:25.876
Guys, we need to get moving.

01:07:25.876 --> 01:07:27.169
Shit.

01:07:29.713 --> 01:07:31.089
Fuck. Shit.

01:07:32.883 --> 01:07:34.217
- We need to hide.
- Go.

01:07:34.217 --> 01:07:35.510
Run. Now!

01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:37.262
Gotta move.

01:07:37.262 --> 01:07:38.472
- Go.
- Okay.

01:07:38.472 --> 01:07:39.931
Go!

01:07:44.019 --> 01:07:46.605
In here. In here.

01:07:46.605 --> 01:07:48.440
- This is it.
- Is this it?

01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:49.983
Yeah. Everybody in.

01:07:49.983 --> 01:07:51.276
Everybody in.

01:07:51.276 --> 01:07:52.944
Go, go, go.

01:07:57.991 --> 01:08:00.077
What now?

01:08:00.077 --> 01:08:01.328
Shh.

01:08:03.246 --> 01:08:04.456
Just wait.

01:08:26.310 --> 01:08:28.814
Kids' gone.

01:08:28.979 --> 01:08:32.442
- Maybe they think we got out.
- Do you think so?

01:08:32.442 --> 01:08:35.153
- Maybe.
- Which way do we go?

01:08:35.153 --> 01:08:36.363
Arial, can you guide us?

01:08:36.363 --> 01:08:37.781
<i>Of course, Jenny.</i>

01:08:37.948 --> 01:08:40.783
<i>You need to move deeper
into the underground system.</i>

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:43.328
<i>Please, listen
to everything I say.</i>

01:08:43.328 --> 01:08:44.662
<i>We haven't got much time.</i>

01:08:48.707 --> 01:08:50.252
Come on, guys,
you're, you're too slow.

01:08:50.252 --> 01:08:51.545
Cassandra, stay close.

01:08:51.545 --> 01:08:53.505
Gotta move quicker.
Guys, come on.

01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:04.307
<i>Take the next turning
on your right.</i>

01:09:04.307 --> 01:09:07.310
Arial, you're breaking up.
Which way?

01:09:08.603 --> 01:09:10.814
Cassandra, follow me.
Hold my hand.

01:09:10.981 --> 01:09:11.814
We're almost there.
I'm at the back.

01:09:11.982 --> 01:09:13.358
We gotta keep moving, come on.

01:09:13.358 --> 01:09:15.777
- Down here, Cassandra.
- All right.

01:09:15.777 --> 01:09:19.156
- All right.
<i>- Go, second level.</i>

01:09:19.156 --> 01:09:21.158
Okay.
Here we go and jump.

01:09:21.158 --> 01:09:22.283
Okay.

01:09:22.283 --> 01:09:24.161
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:09:24.161 --> 01:09:25.287
- You're okay?
- Yeah.

01:09:25.287 --> 01:09:26.287
All right.

01:09:28.456 --> 01:09:29.916
Cassandra, follow me.

01:09:32.544 --> 01:09:33.837
Come on, guys.
You're too slow.

01:09:34.004 --> 01:09:35.255
Don't worry, we're gonna
get out of here.

01:09:35.255 --> 01:09:36.631
We're gonna be fine.

01:09:39.259 --> 01:09:40.594
<i>Exit the hatch in front of you,</i>

01:09:40.594 --> 01:09:42.554
<i>then take the hatch
on the right.</i>

01:09:44.139 --> 01:09:45.599
Guys, wait here.

01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:52.147
<i>I am detecting the presence
of the candidates.</i>

01:10:00.155 --> 01:10:02.782
We need to be quick.
We need to be quiet.

01:10:02.782 --> 01:10:04.451
I'm gonna go first,
I'll find the first hatch,

01:10:04.451 --> 01:10:05.785
and then you move fast.
Okay?

01:10:07.162 --> 01:10:08.538
Fine.

01:10:09.956 --> 01:10:12.167
Darby.

01:10:12.167 --> 01:10:14.794
Just be careful, okay?

01:10:14.794 --> 01:10:16.213
I'm never careful.

01:10:17.589 --> 01:10:18.924
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:10:28.433 --> 01:10:29.809
Cassandra,
stay nice and quiet.

01:10:29.809 --> 01:10:31.686
- Shh.
- Good girl.

01:10:56.336 --> 01:10:58.797
Darby? Darby!

01:10:58.797 --> 01:11:00.715
Can you see anything?

01:11:00.715 --> 01:11:02.801
Is it clear? Is it clear?

01:11:07.097 --> 01:11:09.516
Are they out there?

01:11:09.516 --> 01:11:11.184
I think it's clear.

01:11:13.144 --> 01:11:14.437
Shh, okay.

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:22.821
- Be quick.
- Yeah.

01:11:22.988 --> 01:11:24.406
Cassandra, I'll go first and...

01:11:26.408 --> 01:11:27.742
Darby!

01:11:27.742 --> 01:11:30.745
Get off me!

01:11:38.378 --> 01:11:39.796
Fuck!

01:12:20.545 --> 01:12:22.922
Darby, no.

01:12:24.466 --> 01:12:26.801
<i>There's nothing you can do
for him now.</i>

01:12:26.801 --> 01:12:28.511
<i>You must keep moving.</i>

01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:33.433
This way.

01:12:33.433 --> 01:12:34.642
Cassandra, are you okay?

01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:54.287
Arial, which way?

01:12:56.998 --> 01:12:59.042
Arial, please, help us.

01:12:59.042 --> 01:13:01.378
- Which way, Miss Jenny?
- Hey, it's okay. Arial?

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:08.593
<i>They're everywhere.</i>

01:13:08.593 --> 01:13:09.969
Go, go, go, go!

01:13:13.598 --> 01:13:15.058
Cassandra, I'm right behind you.

01:13:21.189 --> 01:13:22.732
Oh, come on!

01:13:25.068 --> 01:13:27.070
I can't open it.
Go back.

01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:28.488
Go back.

01:13:34.536 --> 01:13:36.037
Down here.
Okay.

01:13:36.037 --> 01:13:37.956
We're gonna get out here.

01:13:44.254 --> 01:13:45.547
Go back! Go back!

01:13:45.547 --> 01:13:47.549
- Back.
- Back the way we came?

01:13:47.549 --> 01:13:50.176
Keep going.
You all right, Cassandra?

01:13:51.386 --> 01:13:52.720
They got me!

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:54.514
Cassandra!

01:13:54.514 --> 01:13:55.557
Jen!

01:13:55.557 --> 01:13:56.933
They've got her! No!

01:13:56.933 --> 01:13:58.685
- Jen?
- Hey, they've got me!

01:13:58.685 --> 01:14:00.937
Help!

01:14:02.063 --> 01:14:03.523
Cassandra!

01:14:05.733 --> 01:14:07.819
Miss Jenny!

01:14:07.819 --> 01:14:10.572
Cassandra!

01:14:10.572 --> 01:14:11.948
They've got me!

01:14:15.994 --> 01:14:17.787
- I can hear her!
- Miss Jenny!

01:14:17.787 --> 01:14:20.331
I can hear her.
Cassandra?

01:14:20.331 --> 01:14:22.584
Cassandra?

01:14:22.584 --> 01:14:25.086
She's gone.

01:14:25.253 --> 01:14:27.130
No, I am not abandoning her.

01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:29.841
We need to move in
the other direction!

01:14:29.841 --> 01:14:31.342
I have to find her!

01:14:38.057 --> 01:14:39.767
Tiggs!

01:14:41.644 --> 01:14:44.355
Tiggs, what's happening?

01:14:44.355 --> 01:14:45.773
Tiggs, I don't know what...

01:14:45.773 --> 01:14:47.567
<i>Tiggs!</i>

01:14:47.567 --> 01:14:49.777
Tiggs!

01:14:52.822 --> 01:14:54.365
Tiggs!

01:14:56.993 --> 01:14:59.454
<i>This is the facility
coordinator...</i>

01:14:59.454 --> 01:15:03.458
Get away from me!

01:15:07.295 --> 01:15:09.714
Enough there! Go!

01:15:09.714 --> 01:15:11.633
Leave me alone!

01:15:11.633 --> 01:15:13.468
Please, leave me alone!

01:15:13.468 --> 01:15:15.053
<i>I think we're gonna
have to watch this...</i>

01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:17.555
- Get out of my head!
<i>- It's Darby, right?</i>

01:15:17.555 --> 01:15:18.681
Eh, no!

01:15:18.681 --> 01:15:21.559
<i>I see you.</i>

01:15:21.559 --> 01:15:22.560
<i>What's going on?</i>

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:24.521
Get away from me!

01:15:30.443 --> 01:15:32.904
Stay away from me!

01:15:32.904 --> 01:15:35.073
I know you're here.

01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:38.535
You stay away from me,
do you hear me?

01:16:26.666 --> 01:16:29.752
Oh, my God.
It's really you.

01:16:33.423 --> 01:16:36.050
Cassandra, what's wrong?

01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:39.053
What have they done to you?

01:16:39.053 --> 01:16:40.972
Come on, we have to go.

01:16:40.972 --> 01:16:43.057
Are you really that stupid?

01:16:52.984 --> 01:16:54.652
Cool, huh?

01:17:03.411 --> 01:17:06.289
You could... you could
see this whole time?

01:17:06.289 --> 01:17:08.666
Poor little Jenny.

01:17:08.666 --> 01:17:12.086
Her friend Arial
leading her deeper and deeper

01:17:12.086 --> 01:17:14.047
down the rabbit hole.

01:17:17.675 --> 01:17:19.177
Hello, Jenny.

01:17:19.177 --> 01:17:22.138
It appears I have been
under Cassandra's control.

01:17:24.015 --> 01:17:27.060
- The whole time?
- It would seem so.

01:17:27.226 --> 01:17:30.563
I am so sorry, Jenny.
So dreadfully sorry.

01:17:30.563 --> 01:17:32.357
Please, forgive me.

01:17:32.357 --> 01:17:35.276
Augmented Reality Information
Advanced Learning.

01:17:35.276 --> 01:17:37.570
Here to help,
nurture and advise.

01:17:41.532 --> 01:17:44.160
Every game
only has two outcomes.

01:17:45.244 --> 01:17:48.331
Win... or lose.

01:17:49.457 --> 01:17:50.583
<i>Miss Jenny...</i>

01:18:06.808 --> 01:18:07.892
And...

01:18:09.143 --> 01:18:11.104
You just lost.

01:18:15.817 --> 01:18:18.069
Are you gonna answer that?

01:18:28.496 --> 01:18:30.498
A good hunter
doesn't just start shooting

01:18:30.498 --> 01:18:32.709
and hope for the best.

01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:36.045
We invest time
into studying our prey.

01:18:36.045 --> 01:18:39.507
Identifying weaknesses
and exploiting them.

01:18:44.095 --> 01:18:46.013
There's nothing wrong
with having

01:18:46.013 --> 01:18:47.640
a little fun along the way.

01:18:50.518 --> 01:18:52.478
We are children...

01:18:55.690 --> 01:18:57.650
We need to play.

01:19:08.745 --> 01:19:11.497
It's always been about you,
Jenny.

01:19:22.925 --> 01:19:24.093
Hello?

01:19:26.262 --> 01:19:29.098
Yes, I am leaving now.

01:19:29.098 --> 01:19:32.727
