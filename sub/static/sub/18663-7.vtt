were charging at us,

their air-locked door.

42:19.720 --> 42:20.756
We should wait for backup.

42:20.920 --> 42:22.195
Every second we wait
is another second

42:22.280 --> 42:24.511
that Dawes can put
a bullet in Cortazar's head.

42:24.600 --> 42:26.478
God only knows what
Cortazar's told him already.

42:27.240 --> 42:28.799
Safety's off.
Is that what you want?

42:30.280 --> 42:31.350
Force the air lock.

42:33.120 --> 42:35.032
If it comes down to it,
I go low, you go high.

42:35.120 --> 42:37.032
Open our door on my mark.
Ready?

42:40.600 --> 42:43.718
- Three, two, one.
- (DOOR BEEPS)

42:57.880 --> 42:59.155
Don't shoot,
boss man.

43:06.080 --> 43:08.276
You got me.
Just me.

43:10.800 --> 43:12.439
Turn around,
you little shit.

43:13.280 --> 43:14.316
I got nothing!

43:18.160 --> 43:20.720
NAOMI: (OVER PHONE) <i>We lost Dawes.
He's got Cortazar.</i>

43:20.800 --> 43:21.916
<i>They're gone.</i>
