00:00.826 --> 00:02.176
Previously on Prison Break:

00:02.219 --> 00:03.177
How does a simple fisherman

00:03.220 --> 00:05.222
know so much
about the Company?

00:05.266 --> 00:06.789
You gonna do this or not?

00:06.832 --> 00:09.400
Yes, but once we're out,
I consider you collateral.

00:09.444 --> 00:10.488
Lincoln causes as many

00:10.532 --> 00:12.099
problems as he solves.

00:12.142 --> 00:14.536
He needs to get out
of his own way, and I think

00:14.579 --> 00:15.363
you can assist him.

00:15.406 --> 00:16.581
I stay one step ahead,

00:16.625 --> 00:18.496
and you get 50 grand.

00:18.540 --> 00:19.628
What happened?

00:19.671 --> 00:21.195
She came up to me
just like you said

00:21.238 --> 00:22.718
and offered me a bunch of cash
to talk behind your back.

00:22.761 --> 00:24.024
So we stick
to the plan, right?

00:24.067 --> 00:25.155
Yeah.
Cool.

00:25.199 --> 00:27.984
I found a passport.
Who's Gary Miller?

00:28.028 --> 00:29.812
I've been working on a way
for us to be together.

00:29.855 --> 00:32.858
James, how-how
can I believe you?

00:32.902 --> 00:35.122
How can I believe
anything anymore?

00:39.126 --> 00:41.954
[men yelling]

00:46.394 --> 00:48.613
[yelling]

00:48.657 --> 00:50.050
We got a way out of this?

00:50.093 --> 00:51.747
We need some kind of support
brace for the tunnel.

00:51.790 --> 00:56.143
Or what?Or the whole thing collapses,
and we're buried alive.

01:01.452 --> 01:02.714
No more excuses.

01:02.758 --> 01:04.455
Papa's dead
because of this Yankee.

01:04.499 --> 01:07.545
I'll kill him myself
if I have to, all right?

01:07.589 --> 01:09.199
He survived the box.

01:09.243 --> 01:10.287
So what?

01:14.509 --> 01:16.424
The guards went after Scofield.

01:16.467 --> 01:18.600
Scofield won.

01:18.643 --> 01:19.514
He's a folk hero now.

01:22.952 --> 01:24.954
Look, I want Scofield
dead as much as you,

01:24.997 --> 01:27.348
but not at the cost
of an uprising.

01:57.073 --> 01:58.379
Mail call.

02:24.013 --> 02:25.493
Who's that?

02:25.536 --> 02:29.105
That's my son.

02:30.106 --> 02:32.413
Bagwell gave the okay.
The coast is clear.

02:32.456 --> 02:34.415
We gotta go.

02:38.767 --> 02:41.073
I didn't think
I'd see you again.

02:41.117 --> 02:44.251
Once someone goes
into the box, it's...

02:44.294 --> 02:46.209
It was a misunderstanding.

02:46.253 --> 02:49.560
They wanted to talk to you
about the helicopters, right?

02:49.604 --> 02:51.693
What helicopters?

02:51.736 --> 02:54.174
Were you really trying
to escape?

02:54.217 --> 02:56.567
I don't know what you're talking
about, and neither do you.

02:58.265 --> 03:02.617
Just so you know,
Bagwell's coming with us.

03:02.660 --> 03:03.835
You were gone.

03:03.879 --> 03:05.663
He had something we needed.

03:05.707 --> 03:07.056
I didn't have a choice.

03:11.321 --> 03:12.583
Fine.

03:12.627 --> 03:15.151
So what's the new plan?

03:22.680 --> 03:24.552
Did you tell him?

03:24.595 --> 03:25.379
Yeah.

03:25.422 --> 03:26.684
I am coming with you.

03:26.728 --> 03:28.077
Okay by me.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.731
Everyone hear that?
You hear that, lawman?

03:29.774 --> 03:31.515
But you're staying up here.

03:31.559 --> 03:33.256
Maybe I didn't enunciate myself.

03:33.300 --> 03:36.520
The work downstairs
requires two hands.

03:38.609 --> 03:43.223
Hey. We need somebody to stay
outside in case Sammy returns.

04:04.374 --> 04:05.636
Whoa.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.072
I thought we couldn't
dig through this stuff.

04:07.116 --> 04:09.161
The bracing's gonna be tricky.

04:09.205 --> 04:10.946
Unless the tunnel
gets the proper support,

04:10.989 --> 04:12.948
it's all going to come down
on our heads.

04:12.991 --> 04:14.776
We should have the materials
for the braces,

04:14.819 --> 04:17.779
but we'll need a
saw to cut them to
size and a hammer.

04:17.822 --> 04:20.390
Can you help us out?

04:20.434 --> 04:22.044
Yeah. I can do that.

04:25.613 --> 04:27.092
Two days.

04:27.136 --> 04:29.530
And if not?

04:29.573 --> 04:31.314
Two days.

04:33.795 --> 04:36.537
Guillermo should have
everything we need.

04:36.580 --> 04:37.625
You know where
he is, right?

04:37.668 --> 04:38.756
I think it's, uh...

04:38.800 --> 04:40.932
It's down this
corridor on the left.

04:40.976 --> 04:44.109
Halfway down. Cell 40.

04:44.153 --> 04:46.764
Down the corridor on the left.

04:46.808 --> 04:49.332
Cell 40. Okeydoke.

05:03.085 --> 05:06.088
Are you lost already, Teodoro?

05:06.131 --> 05:08.656
No.

05:08.699 --> 05:11.485
But you are.

05:42.211 --> 05:45.127
This is my room now.

05:48.739 --> 05:50.219
You're done in here.

05:50.262 --> 05:52.787
If you had gone
after Scofield today,

05:52.830 --> 05:54.702
all would have been forgiven.

05:54.745 --> 05:56.356
This is suicide.

05:56.399 --> 05:58.532
Shut up, old man!

05:58.575 --> 06:00.142
I'll take my chances.

06:00.185 --> 06:03.101
Yeah. You think
you can run Sona?

06:03.145 --> 06:06.017
You couldn't even run shipments
from one dock to the other,

06:06.061 --> 06:08.411
but I still
keep you by my side.

06:13.590 --> 06:15.070
I'll let you walk out of here

06:15.113 --> 06:17.638
out of respect
for what you were.

06:19.204 --> 06:20.423
Come on!

06:22.947 --> 06:25.602
Get the hell out of here!

06:31.869 --> 06:34.394
All of you ready to do this?

06:39.486 --> 06:40.922
Until Lechero gets back,

06:40.965 --> 06:42.140
we should start
looking for pieces

06:42.184 --> 06:44.099
about four feet
in length.

[footsteps approaching]

07:14.303 --> 07:16.218
[whistles]

07:17.959 --> 07:20.396
I'm running things now!

07:22.833 --> 07:24.487
Anyone got a problem
with that...

07:26.533 --> 07:28.491
...come get it!

07:36.630 --> 07:38.501
Good.

07:38.545 --> 07:41.896
First order of business,

07:41.939 --> 07:46.422
a case of rum to the man
who brings me Michael Scofield!

07:46.466 --> 07:51.209
[cheering]

07:51.949 --> 07:54.386
[cheering]

08:25.592 --> 08:28.464
[speaking Spanish]

08:28.508 --> 08:29.987
Okay? Gracias.

08:30.031 --> 08:34.557
Osberto. That's who
you want to talk to.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.124
This guy on the up-and-up?

08:36.167 --> 08:38.300
The guy I was running things
into Sona for arranged this,

08:38.343 --> 08:42.086
so it's as up as it's gonna get
for this kind of deal. So, yes.

08:42.130 --> 08:43.305
Osberto doesn't
speak English, though,

08:43.348 --> 08:45.002
so how do you
want to work it?

08:45.046 --> 08:46.438
I need to meet
with Susan.

08:46.482 --> 08:48.223
I'll take Sofia.
She can translate for me.

08:48.266 --> 08:50.181
Don't worry about it.

08:50.225 --> 08:53.576
So when I meet with Susan,
what do you want me to tell her?

08:53.620 --> 08:55.535
Tell her whatever you think
she wants to hear.

08:55.578 --> 08:58.059
Just buy us enough time
to do our thing, all right?

08:58.102 --> 08:59.451
Home stretch, Papi.

08:59.495 --> 09:01.192
Listen, man. I want
to thank you for everything.

09:01.236 --> 09:03.934
Oh, Linc, please.When we get home,
I got your back--

09:03.978 --> 09:05.196
whatever you need,
whatever you want.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.981
That won't be necessary.

09:07.024 --> 09:09.287
When I'm back home,
I'm a saint.

09:09.331 --> 09:12.029
I'm not even jaywalking.

09:12.073 --> 09:14.031
Osberto. Don't forget.

09:14.075 --> 09:15.772
Osberto.

09:35.879 --> 09:39.448
If Scofield steps outside
that tunnel, he's a dead man.

09:39.491 --> 09:41.493
Far as I can tell,
we have two options.

09:41.537 --> 09:44.061
We can invite Sammy
on the escape...

09:44.105 --> 09:45.236
He can go to hell.

09:45.280 --> 09:48.544
Which brings us
to option number two.

09:49.676 --> 09:52.417
You wouldn't last a second
in there with Sammy.

09:52.461 --> 09:54.506
Would you?

09:56.334 --> 10:01.775
Then I guess we'll just have
to outsource.

10:08.390 --> 10:09.652
I felt sorry
for the guy,

10:09.696 --> 10:12.350
but you don't chicken-foot
an ex-Delta Force

10:12.394 --> 10:14.178
and expect to make it out alive.

10:14.222 --> 10:16.877
You're Delta Force?
Like Chuck Norris?

10:16.920 --> 10:19.096
Norris? He wouldn't have
made it through boot camp.

10:19.140 --> 10:21.795
Excuse me a second.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.667
I see you're
making friends.

10:24.711 --> 10:26.277
Hey, once you get
the hang of it,

10:26.321 --> 10:28.062
this place ain't so rough.

10:28.105 --> 10:29.977
Yeah. Too bad.

10:30.020 --> 10:31.805
Too bad what?

10:31.848 --> 10:34.155
You were right. We got

10:34.198 --> 10:35.460
a little plan going on.

10:35.504 --> 10:37.158
But, you know, if you're
putting down roots...

10:37.201 --> 10:39.682
No, no. You were saying...?

10:39.726 --> 10:42.685
We're supposed to be out
of here in 48 hours.

10:42.729 --> 10:44.295
Not through Scofield.

10:44.339 --> 10:45.819
You heard the town crier.

10:45.862 --> 10:48.909
College Boy's life
is barely worth a case of booze.

10:48.952 --> 10:51.215
Hence our current
conversation.

10:51.259 --> 10:55.176
I know how you got
your cherry yesterday,

10:55.219 --> 10:59.093
daubing your wraps
in acetone,

10:59.136 --> 11:03.053
smothering the guy until he
passed out from the fumes.

11:03.097 --> 11:06.709
You do the same thing
to Sammy, and you're in.

11:06.753 --> 11:08.711
Chicken-foot Sammy?

11:08.755 --> 11:10.408
Chicken-foot Sammy.

11:10.452 --> 11:13.673
It's all riding
on you, champ.

11:29.210 --> 11:31.299
Thank you.

11:31.342 --> 11:33.257
This shouldn't
take long.

11:33.301 --> 11:34.128
What are you getting?

11:34.171 --> 11:36.086
Supplies.
For?

11:36.130 --> 11:38.175
I don't want to get
caught flat-footed again.

11:38.219 --> 11:39.481
You know
what that means?

11:39.524 --> 11:40.700
No.

11:40.743 --> 11:42.353
Well, these people
obviously have a plan.

11:42.397 --> 11:43.615
We're gonna need
one, too.

11:43.659 --> 11:45.530
Does that plan include
screwing over James?

11:45.574 --> 11:47.097
Is it James
or Gary Miller?

11:47.141 --> 11:49.143
Whatever his name is,
there's a part of me

11:49.186 --> 11:53.190
that doesn't want to believe
he works for them...

11:53.234 --> 11:55.279
because he's the man I love,

11:55.323 --> 11:56.803

to prison for me,

11:56.846 --> 11:59.762

to my first trip to Paris.

11:59.806 --> 12:01.895
I haven't turned my back
to that man.

12:03.070 --> 12:05.289
Do I have your word
that he's gonna be all right?

12:05.333 --> 12:08.118
Yeah. Now get in.

12:51.509 --> 12:52.467
Yeah.

I say your name,

anything up.

29:23.413 --> 29:25.720
It's going to be all right.

29:30.594 --> 29:31.682
How'd it go?

29:31.726 --> 29:33.206
Good. I told her
what she wanted to hear,

29:33.249 --> 29:34.207
just like you told me.

29:34.250 --> 29:37.210
That it?Yeah.

29:37.253 --> 29:39.168
Cool. Listen, I want
you to call her up,

29:39.212 --> 29:40.779
tell her you've got
some information.

29:40.822 --> 29:43.259
Make sure she picks you up,
and get in the car, all right?

29:43.303 --> 29:45.174
Okay. Is everything okay?

29:45.218 --> 29:47.220
Yeah. Why?

29:47.263 --> 29:48.743
She looks upset.

29:50.353 --> 29:52.051
I'll call you later.

29:59.362 --> 30:01.712
Got something down here
we can use, Michael.

30:06.674 --> 30:10.373
If they come
through that door...

30:10.417 --> 30:12.419
you hit 'em
right here.

30:12.462 --> 30:14.160
Go ahead, take it.

30:14.203 --> 30:16.466
Go ahead.

30:16.510 --> 30:19.774
It'll puncture the heart.

30:26.215 --> 30:28.827
[prisoners cheering]

30:42.318 --> 30:43.885
You were hiding

30:43.929 --> 30:45.234
Scofield in your room?

30:45.278 --> 30:48.585
Look at you-- the power
make you mad already.

30:50.936 --> 30:52.328
Come along, Norman.

30:52.372 --> 30:53.286
Let's go.

31:25.318 --> 31:27.276
What is so urgent?

31:27.320 --> 31:29.278
Lincoln bought a gun.

31:29.322 --> 31:31.541
I... I asked him what he planned
on doing with it,

31:31.585 --> 31:33.326
but he wouldn't answer.

31:33.369 --> 31:35.937
So I just... I just thought
you might want to know.

31:35.981 --> 31:39.375
If anything changes,
I'll get back to you, okay?

31:39.419 --> 31:40.942
You know, the other day,

31:40.986 --> 31:43.597
when you and Lincoln had
your little spat in the lobby

31:43.640 --> 31:47.340
and you-- all
distraught and jilted--

31:47.383 --> 31:48.776
went across the street
to the bar,

31:48.819 --> 31:51.692
a cynic might think
that was staged.

31:54.477 --> 31:56.305
I'm a cynic, sugar.

31:56.349 --> 31:57.828
You're high, sugar.

31:57.872 --> 32:00.744
If it's any comfort, you guys
almost pulled it off.

32:00.788 --> 32:02.790
The Puerto Rican
and the gorilla--

32:02.833 --> 32:04.923
you really had me scrambling
there for a minute.

32:04.966 --> 32:07.142
Hey, if you don't want
my help, fine, I'm out, okay?

32:07.186 --> 32:09.362
It's a little thing
called a tracing number--

32:09.405 --> 32:11.973
on the check
I gave you.

32:12.017 --> 32:15.237
Apparently,
your extensive expertise

32:15.281 --> 32:16.456
in banking

32:16.499 --> 32:17.370
failed you that day.

32:17.413 --> 32:19.894
You promptly wired
all 25 K

32:19.938 --> 32:22.505
to Maricruz Delgado

32:22.549 --> 32:23.637
in Chicago

32:23.680 --> 32:25.987
at 123 "Please Don't Hurt Me"
Lane.

32:26.031 --> 32:28.294
I swear to God,
if something happens to her...

32:28.337 --> 32:29.338
If what?!

32:30.426 --> 32:33.734
What, jackass?!

32:35.170 --> 32:39.479
You're going to go back there
and you're going to get me

32:39.522 --> 32:40.915
some real information,

32:40.959 --> 32:45.267
or Maricruz and her head
are going to part ways.

32:47.574 --> 32:49.010
Get out of my car.

32:50.490 --> 32:51.926
Now.

33:05.331 --> 33:07.507
Hey, blanco.

33:07.550 --> 33:09.335
I got your good buddy
Lechero here.

33:09.378 --> 33:12.947
Why don't you give it
the secret knock so he
knows it's you, huh?

33:12.991 --> 33:14.340
The combination.

33:14.383 --> 33:17.169
What makes you think
I have the combination?

33:17.212 --> 33:19.084
Just do what he says. Huh?

33:24.263 --> 33:26.830
How many times you gonna pull
that little thing out?

33:26.874 --> 33:29.137
As many times
as I feel necessary.

33:29.181 --> 33:31.705
What, you think it
make you look strong?

33:31.748 --> 33:34.316
All it does is magnify
your weakness.

Funny, I'm
feeling pretty

33:38.625 --> 33:40.627

33:40.670 --> 33:44.761
Now, the combination, old man.
We're not asking again.

33:46.894 --> 33:48.417
Sammy!

33:48.461 --> 33:50.593
I'm opening the door.

33:50.637 --> 33:51.420
Michael, do not open the...

33:54.554 --> 33:55.511
Drop 'em!

33:55.555 --> 33:58.340
Drop them, I said!

33:58.384 --> 33:59.559
Now move!

34:08.481 --> 34:10.222
You're escaping with him?

34:10.265 --> 34:12.528
I was gonna tell you
all about this, Bredda.

34:12.572 --> 34:15.270
It just never came up, eh?

34:20.449 --> 34:21.494
Take it.

34:21.537 --> 34:23.409
It's yours.

34:23.452 --> 34:24.279
The tunnel,

34:24.323 --> 34:26.107
the escape plan, everything.

34:26.151 --> 34:27.500
We can go together.

34:29.589 --> 34:30.894
I'm taking everything you got.

34:30.938 --> 34:34.115
But you ain't going nowhere.

34:38.641 --> 34:40.208
How you finishing up this hole?

34:40.252 --> 34:42.341
Promise me you'll take
Whistler with you.

34:44.604 --> 34:46.736
You making demands on me?

34:46.780 --> 34:47.955
Huh?

34:47.998 --> 34:50.392
I understand...

34:50.436 --> 34:52.351
why you're going to kill me,

34:52.394 --> 34:54.570
but he's done
nothing wrong.

34:54.614 --> 34:56.659
I'll tell you everything
you need to know,

34:56.703 --> 34:58.618
just take him with you.

34:58.661 --> 35:00.010
You need him.

35:00.054 --> 35:02.535
He's the only one
who figured this one out.

35:04.014 --> 35:06.365
Don't you worry,
I'll take care of your friend.

35:07.627 --> 35:09.672
All right.

35:09.716 --> 35:11.544
First, you need to
keep building braces

35:11.587 --> 35:13.502
to support
the tunnel as you go.

35:13.546 --> 35:14.677
How you do that?

35:14.721 --> 35:15.548
Whistler can show you how.

35:15.591 --> 35:17.158
Look like you just

35:17.202 --> 35:19.552
make some wood squares
from these boxes here.

35:19.595 --> 35:21.510
Like I said,

35:21.554 --> 35:23.512
Whistler
can show you.

35:23.556 --> 35:25.558
How much further to the surface?

35:25.601 --> 35:27.647
Not far.

35:27.690 --> 35:30.998
Can't be more than ten feet.

35:36.177 --> 35:37.700
Impressive, blanco.

35:37.744 --> 35:39.180
[chuckles]

35:39.224 --> 35:41.356
Too bad you won't be around
to enjoy it.

36:19.786 --> 36:22.310
How long is this
going to set us back?

36:22.354 --> 36:24.965
What's gonna set us back is if
the tower guards are looking at

36:25.008 --> 36:27.620
a giant sinkhole
out in No Man's Land.

36:36.368 --> 36:37.412
Michael?

36:49.207 --> 36:50.469
We're good.

36:50.512 --> 36:52.297
Yeah.

36:54.124 --> 36:56.475
We're good.

37:26.287 --> 37:28.942
Back in business.

37:28.985 --> 37:29.986
I'm in.

37:30.030 --> 37:31.988
For what, getting
your ass kicked?

37:32.032 --> 37:34.513
I'm in or I shout it
from the rooftops.

37:36.776 --> 37:39.039
You're in, Champ.

37:53.880 --> 37:55.969
Okay, I want you to stay here.

37:56.012 --> 37:58.580
I got to get
something, all right?

37:58.624 --> 38:00.190

38:20.080 --> 38:22.561
Yeah, I'm two blocks away.

38:22.604 --> 38:26.304
If he doesn't take you, I will.

39:02.165 --> 39:03.471
Here.

39:03.515 --> 39:05.125
Use this.

39:05.168 --> 39:06.213
Thanks.

39:06.256 --> 39:07.562
Right up there.

times you wanted me

39:11.784 --> 39:13.568
to prove I was a fisherman,

39:13.612 --> 39:16.745
I should have been asking
if you were a real engineer.

39:16.789 --> 39:20.096
That could've been one
of us buried down there.

39:20.140 --> 39:21.707
I'll do better next time.

39:23.535 --> 39:27.930
I'm gonna go back down and try
to salvage some of those braces.

39:27.974 --> 39:30.237
Yeah, I'll go
with you.

40:03.488 --> 40:05.794
Never gets any easier.
