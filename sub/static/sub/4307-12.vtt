00:00.875 --> 00:01.823
Previously on "Dominion"...

00:01.876 --> 00:03.159
It's the Morning Star.

00:03.161 --> 00:05.244
My older brother. Lucifer.

00:07.999 --> 00:09.248
It's the Amphora of Darkness.

00:09.300 --> 00:10.667
It brings out the darkness inside you.

00:10.669 --> 00:11.968
It drives you mad with visions

00:12.003 --> 00:13.503
to make you hurt yourself or someone else.

00:13.555 --> 00:17.590
Your humanity is hanging by a thread.

00:17.642 --> 00:20.009
Cut it.

00:20.011 --> 00:22.762
Horrible things I've done.

00:27.185 --> 00:28.768
My baby.

00:28.820 --> 00:31.270
I thought I lost you.

00:34.359 --> 00:36.492
Alex?

00:36.528 --> 00:39.078
Where's Willow?

00:42.367 --> 00:44.250
Good-bye, David.

00:46.588 --> 00:49.706
You mean nothing.

00:54.429 --> 00:56.045
I will kill them all.

00:56.047 --> 00:57.213
The Amphora of Darkness.

00:57.265 --> 00:59.048
We need to find out who survived.

00:59.050 --> 01:02.051
God's wrath has never been
unleashed on an archangel.

01:05.607 --> 01:08.057
Michael, he'll come back for me.

01:08.059 --> 01:10.476
No, he's forgotten you.

01:10.528 --> 01:13.563
Julian's army, they're already here.

01:13.565 --> 01:15.732
You're the master of all
angels in New Delphi now.

01:15.784 --> 01:18.117
- It's your army.
- Good.

01:18.153 --> 01:20.953
They will be another weapon to use,

01:20.989 --> 01:25.241
but my brother's death will be by this hand

01:25.243 --> 01:29.045
when I plunge my sword
into his traitorous heart.

01:55.607 --> 01:58.274
Gabriel?

01:58.326 --> 02:00.827
The Darkness... it was you.

02:00.862 --> 02:02.829
Father may have gone,

02:02.864 --> 02:05.114
but at least he left his toys behind.

02:05.116 --> 02:09.285
What have you done?

02:09.287 --> 02:12.121
Gabriel, your eyes.

02:12.123 --> 02:15.792
The Darkness is inside you.

02:15.794 --> 02:17.126
Julian did this to you somehow.

02:17.178 --> 02:18.177
You're not yourself.

02:18.213 --> 02:19.796
Nonsense.

02:19.848 --> 02:22.298
Julian merely lifted the veil.

02:22.300 --> 02:26.219
For so long I blamed Alex for
everything that's happened,

02:26.271 --> 02:29.021
but now I know who's truly responsible.

02:29.057 --> 02:31.140
You.

02:31.142 --> 02:34.143
No. We stood together in New Delphi.

02:34.195 --> 02:36.646
I haven't forgotten your sacrifice.

02:41.035 --> 02:42.201
What are you doing?

02:42.237 --> 02:43.820
I'm going to kill you, Michael,

02:43.822 --> 02:45.822
and everything you love.

02:45.824 --> 02:47.323
I won't fight you.

02:47.375 --> 02:51.460
Good, then die quickly.

03:30.285 --> 03:34.754
It's gonna get worse before
it gets better, right?

03:34.789 --> 03:36.289
I don't know, Alex.

03:36.341 --> 03:39.375
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

03:39.377 --> 03:40.543
Look at me.

03:40.545 --> 03:44.380
What you lost, there are no words,

03:44.382 --> 03:47.266
but I need you with me, okay?

03:47.302 --> 03:50.269
We need to get to Claire
and make sure she's okay.

03:54.943 --> 03:57.526
Then stop talking and start moving.

03:57.562 --> 03:59.812
We'll check the suite first.

04:03.117 --> 04:05.568
Alex.

04:08.039 --> 04:10.072
Claire, are you okay?

04:12.577 --> 04:15.077
No, Claire, don't... don't shoot.

04:20.584 --> 04:22.501
You killed my guard.

04:22.553 --> 04:24.587
He was dead, but I don't
know if I shot him, Claire.

04:24.589 --> 04:25.922
I don't know.

04:25.924 --> 04:28.224
How did you get out of your cell?

04:28.259 --> 04:29.642
I don't know. I woke up in House Whele

04:29.677 --> 04:32.345
holding a gun to my head.

04:34.265 --> 04:35.648
It happened to you, didn't it?

04:39.520 --> 04:41.437
What did you see?

04:41.439 --> 04:45.024
My worst nightmare.

04:45.076 --> 04:46.442
You're dead.

04:48.446 --> 04:51.580
I am so sorry.

04:51.616 --> 04:56.535
Please forgive me. Forgive me.

04:58.506 --> 05:03.709
You... you and Rose, you... you
treated me like an eight-ball.

05:03.761 --> 05:08.214
You trained me to seduce David Whele

05:08.266 --> 05:11.100
like we did to her.

05:11.135 --> 05:15.137
I tried... I tried to
resist, but I lost myself.

05:15.139 --> 05:17.723
It was... it was so...

05:17.775 --> 05:21.060
Real.

05:21.112 --> 05:25.448
More than real.

05:25.483 --> 05:30.820
What I saw was more like a dream...

05:30.822 --> 05:33.456
everything I ever wanted.

05:33.491 --> 05:38.661
She has my eyes, your
chin, don't you think?

05:38.663 --> 05:39.662
Yeah.

05:45.136 --> 05:47.053
I got to find Alex.

05:47.088 --> 05:50.139
Claire?

05:50.174 --> 05:52.675
Will you trust me?

05:57.515 --> 06:01.100
Doesn't look like I have a choice, does it?

06:12.830 --> 06:15.831
Hey, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

06:15.867 --> 06:19.368
Shh-shh-shh.

06:19.420 --> 06:21.203
Don't despair.

06:21.205 --> 06:24.040
We all saw the worst things possible.

06:24.042 --> 06:26.092
What did you see?

06:29.130 --> 06:33.132
The truth.

06:33.184 --> 06:35.351
Vega must die.

06:37.555 --> 06:40.606
- I can't go on.
- You won't have to.

07:09.720 --> 07:13.172
Get away from me. Stay back!

07:16.094 --> 07:19.345
Rough night, huh?

07:19.397 --> 07:23.265
Are you real?

07:23.267 --> 07:25.768
Flesh and blood.

07:25.770 --> 07:30.439
Whatever happened, it's over...

07:30.441 --> 07:32.908
for now at least.

07:32.944 --> 07:36.412
I saw things.

07:36.447 --> 07:38.781
You and me both.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.450
What matters is that we survived.

07:47.792 --> 07:50.176
You're David Whele.

07:52.797 --> 07:55.097
That's impossible.

07:55.133 --> 07:57.800
Yeah, yeah,

07:57.852 --> 08:03.472
apparently I managed to
survive my own hanging,

08:03.524 --> 08:06.058
unless this is still a
figment of my imagination.

08:06.110 --> 08:07.893
God, I hope not.

08:12.316 --> 08:16.535
What brought you here to the War Room?

08:16.571 --> 08:19.738
I... I was at my post.

08:19.790 --> 08:21.657
I'm a Comm Officer.

08:21.709 --> 08:25.744
Ah, a useful man.

08:28.549 --> 08:31.383
Well, son,

08:31.419 --> 08:35.054
if my eyes aren't lying,

08:35.089 --> 08:39.174
it appears our time together is limited.

08:48.603 --> 08:50.769
Noma.

08:56.244 --> 08:57.993
Claire?

08:58.029 --> 09:00.446
Alex? You're alive.

09:02.867 --> 09:05.584
- You're hurt.
- No, I'm fine.

09:08.873 --> 09:10.456
You hear that?

09:13.261 --> 09:14.460
Julian's army.

09:49.847 --> 09:51.080
They'll hit the East Wall first.

09:51.132 --> 09:53.082
Sounds like they're a couple
of miles from the wall.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.883
On foot, they'll be here
in less than an hour.

09:54.919 --> 09:56.969
We don't have a lot of time.

09:59.006 --> 10:00.589
Tell me you have a plan.

10:00.641 --> 10:03.092
Nomes and I will cover the East Wall,

10:03.144 --> 10:06.645
look for survivors, arm them, and fight.

10:06.681 --> 10:08.347
Alex, there won't be enough.

10:08.399 --> 10:09.765
You two get to the War Room.

10:09.817 --> 10:11.517
We need the wall cannons online.

10:11.569 --> 10:12.735
It's our only chance.

10:12.770 --> 10:14.103
Okay, great. I know the codes.

10:14.105 --> 10:15.437
Arika and I will take care of it.

10:15.489 --> 10:16.939
Sooner the better.

10:16.941 --> 10:19.775
Once the eight-balls get here
the walls won't stop them.

10:19.777 --> 10:23.912
Alex...

10:23.948 --> 10:25.781
I don't want this to be the end.

10:25.783 --> 10:27.916
We survived the Darkness.

10:27.952 --> 10:31.453
I'm not dying today, and neither are you.

10:37.962 --> 10:43.799
I saw... I saw our daughter.

10:43.851 --> 10:45.301
Her name was Willow.

10:45.353 --> 10:46.802
Willow?

10:46.804 --> 10:48.721
She was beautiful, and...

10:48.773 --> 10:51.974
Our daughter?

10:52.026 --> 10:55.477
I saw our future,

10:55.479 --> 10:58.030
or what it might have been.

11:01.619 --> 11:04.820
Alex, we got to move.

11:04.822 --> 11:08.407
I'll see you soon, okay?

11:08.459 --> 11:09.992
Be careful.

11:21.672 --> 11:24.506
Gabriel, stop!

11:24.508 --> 11:27.643
You've betrayed me time and time again.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.103
You were the one Julian wanted to kill,

11:38.155 --> 11:41.023
and yet I was the one he
tortured after you left.

11:41.075 --> 11:43.826
I left to protect the Chosen
One and Father's markings.

11:43.861 --> 11:45.861
I did it all for us, for the family!

11:45.913 --> 11:49.415
Ha!

11:49.450 --> 11:51.700
What has family ever meant to you, hmm?

11:51.702 --> 11:53.869
You betrayed our family!

11:53.921 --> 11:56.038
You gave your gift away.

12:02.046 --> 12:03.095
Claire, I'm not coming with you.

12:03.130 --> 12:04.880
I'm going home.

12:07.301 --> 12:10.269
Arika, I can't do this alone.

12:10.304 --> 12:11.603
You can.

12:11.639 --> 12:15.858
You're stronger than you
think, maybe stronger than me,

12:15.893 --> 12:17.059
and this isn't my city.

12:17.061 --> 12:18.894
I... I need to go back to Helena.

12:18.946 --> 12:22.731
This is not about Helena or Vega.

12:22.733 --> 12:26.368
If we don't kill these monsters,
that's it for all of us.

12:28.622 --> 12:33.625
Arika...

12:33.661 --> 12:35.077
please don't leave.

12:35.079 --> 12:36.962
Are you going to stop me?

12:39.467 --> 12:41.133
No.

12:43.220 --> 12:46.171
Too many people have died already.

12:46.223 --> 12:48.307
You want to go? Go.

12:48.342 --> 12:51.727
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

13:01.939 --> 13:03.322
- Yes, that's gonna leave them short
- _

13:03.357 --> 13:05.357
- by about a yard and a half.
- _

13:05.409 --> 13:06.909
They will go for it.

13:06.944 --> 13:10.496
Father's gone. I had hoped I was wrong,

13:10.531 --> 13:13.365
but he really is gone.

13:13.417 --> 13:17.119
I wonder, if your most prized creation

13:17.171 --> 13:22.090
becomes your greatest
failure, what are you do to?

13:22.126 --> 13:23.125
What are you talking about?

13:23.177 --> 13:24.676
Humans.

13:24.712 --> 13:27.129
- They drove him away.
- No, that's not the reason.

13:27.131 --> 13:28.797
That's your interpretation.

13:28.849 --> 13:31.183
Funny, coming from a man gifted

13:31.218 --> 13:34.052
with what one can only assume
are very important markings

13:34.104 --> 13:35.687
that none of us can read.

13:35.723 --> 13:38.190
Another gift from Father.

13:38.225 --> 13:42.978
Uriel and her beloved Apocrypha,
the prophecies he gave Raphael,

13:42.980 --> 13:47.449
the scribblings on your
body, tokens for one and all.

13:47.485 --> 13:50.235
That's what all this is
about, you feeling left out?

13:50.287 --> 13:53.705
Ah, not at all.

13:53.741 --> 13:55.991
Father gave me a gift too.

14:06.971 --> 14:07.920
A seal?

14:07.972 --> 14:12.224
No, not just any seal.

14:12.259 --> 14:15.561
Lucky number seven, the apocalypse.

14:15.596 --> 14:17.179
I don't believe it.

14:17.231 --> 14:18.814
Why would Father entrust you with such...

14:18.849 --> 14:20.849
Power? Isn't it obvious?

14:20.901 --> 14:22.351
Gabriel, what are you doing?

14:22.353 --> 14:24.903
All we have to do is
crack the seventh seal.

14:24.939 --> 14:26.655
The skies will open.

14:26.690 --> 14:28.690
Our kind will descend to cure this world

14:28.692 --> 14:31.193
of a dreadful disease: humanity.

14:31.195 --> 14:34.446
You'll start a war pitting
humans against angels.

14:34.498 --> 14:35.831
You wouldn't.

14:35.866 --> 14:38.367
But it's what Father must have wanted.

14:38.419 --> 14:42.287
When the last human is dead, he'll return.

14:42.339 --> 14:44.423
He has to.

14:44.458 --> 14:48.176
No. No, Raphael's prophecy
foretells a Chosen One.

14:48.212 --> 14:49.928
- No.
- We must find him together.

14:49.964 --> 14:52.965
You'll forgive me if I don't put much stock

14:53.017 --> 14:54.716
in Raphael's prophecies.

14:54.718 --> 14:56.852
She has a rather spotty record

14:56.887 --> 14:59.938
when it comes to predicting the future.

14:59.974 --> 15:05.060
No, there is only one
way to bring Father back,

15:05.112 --> 15:06.612
and it's in my hands.

15:06.647 --> 15:09.448
Gabriel, please don't do this.

15:09.483 --> 15:11.233
If you break that seal... no!

15:13.871 --> 15:16.738
There. It's done.

15:33.807 --> 15:35.090
What have you done?

16:17.143 --> 16:19.644
You broke the seventh seal.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.395
You started the Extermination War.

16:21.431 --> 16:23.531
The seal was made to be broken.

16:23.566 --> 16:25.600
No, you weren't meant to open the heavens.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.602
It was a test, a test you failed.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.021
No. You are wrong.

16:33.576 --> 16:36.077
Eradicating the scourge
of humanity is the only way

16:36.112 --> 16:38.029
to bring our Father home.

16:38.081 --> 16:40.831
That's why he gave us
the power to destroy them.

16:40.867 --> 16:41.999
No, you're wrong.

16:42.035 --> 16:44.168
Father wanted us to save
humanity, all of them.

16:44.203 --> 16:46.287
That's why he gave us the Chosen One.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.421
Agree to disagree.

17:20.239 --> 17:23.824
It's okay! We're human!

17:23.826 --> 17:25.542
We're human!

17:25.578 --> 17:27.127
- Gotta take a chance.
- Okay.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.583
Still no sign of Michael.

17:32.635 --> 17:34.001
He'd be here if he could.

17:34.003 --> 17:36.137
We're on our own.

17:36.172 --> 17:38.839
The city is under attack
by an army of eight-balls,

17:38.891 --> 17:40.675
so if you can use a weapon,

17:40.677 --> 17:42.510
consider yourself a soldier of Vega.

17:42.512 --> 17:43.978
You making yourself our leader?

17:44.013 --> 17:47.431
No, I'm not asking you to fight for me.

17:47.483 --> 17:49.517
I'm asking you to fight with me.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.352
We fight or we die.

17:51.354 --> 17:54.071
If you're killing angels, we're with you.

17:54.107 --> 17:55.356
Good.

17:55.358 --> 17:59.860
Take everyone with a gun and
get to the walls, everyone.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.196
Here you go, sister.

18:02.198 --> 18:03.447
I've never shot a gun before.

18:03.499 --> 18:06.283
- You'll learn.
- I'll show you, uh-huh.

18:06.336 --> 18:08.836
- Come on, I'll show you.
- Okay, thanks.

18:08.871 --> 18:10.371
You guys with me. Let's go.

18:10.373 --> 18:12.790
You practice that talk in the shower?

18:12.842 --> 18:14.375
I haven't showered in two weeks.

18:14.377 --> 18:16.510
Let's go. Let's go.

18:16.546 --> 18:18.012
Yup!

18:18.047 --> 18:22.216
If we're gonna die...

18:22.268 --> 18:25.803
I'm glad I'm gonna go down
fighting next to the man I love.

18:41.154 --> 18:43.070
Claire?

19:12.101 --> 19:14.018
May we be in heaven

19:14.070 --> 19:18.355
a half hour before the
Devil knows we're dead.

19:18.408 --> 19:19.740
You sure you won't join me?

19:19.776 --> 19:22.693
The bottle's almost empty.

19:22.745 --> 19:25.446
Suit yourself.

19:33.956 --> 19:37.007
Why am I not surprised the
cockroach survived in the dark?

19:37.043 --> 19:39.627
Huh. Well, a year ago, I wouldn't

19:39.629 --> 19:42.596
have expected you to survive a bad cold,

19:42.632 --> 19:45.433
so I'm older and wiser.

19:45.468 --> 19:47.468
Older, anyway.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.937
David, I need to get in there.

19:49.972 --> 19:52.306
Yes, to kill me.

19:52.358 --> 19:56.060
Believe me, there is
nothing I would like more.

19:56.112 --> 19:59.480
Look at the monitors, David.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.565
I need to get the cannons online.

20:01.617 --> 20:02.983
There are eight-balls advancing...

20:02.985 --> 20:08.622
Eight-balls racing at our glorious walls.

20:08.658 --> 20:12.076
It's the end of humanity
as we know it, Claire.

20:12.128 --> 20:13.294
I'd offer you a drink,

20:13.329 --> 20:16.831
but it's a... it's a terrible vintage.

20:16.833 --> 20:17.998
Open this door.

20:18.000 --> 20:23.504
Otherwise I die, you die...

20:23.556 --> 20:25.756
and our city dies with us.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.019
Please.

20:57.540 --> 21:00.758
System rebooting.

21:00.793 --> 21:04.211
I'm glad we've finally come
to some kind of understanding.

21:09.218 --> 21:13.020
The only thing that I understand

21:13.055 --> 21:14.688
is that you're a murderer.

21:25.384 --> 21:27.601
My baby is dead.

21:27.637 --> 21:28.886
You killed her.

21:28.938 --> 21:31.438
Ah!

21:31.474 --> 21:34.191
Do you know what it's like
to lose a piece of yourself,

21:34.227 --> 21:38.612
your reason to fight, your reason to live?

21:38.648 --> 21:41.065
Two of my children were murdered

21:41.067 --> 21:44.151
on the first day of the war.

21:44.203 --> 21:47.905
They were torn from my wife's arms,

21:47.957 --> 21:53.577
but I found solace in building this city.

21:53.579 --> 21:56.380
I poured my love and energy into it,

21:56.415 --> 21:58.833
and this city became my child.

21:58.885 --> 22:01.969
I gave far more to this city, to Vega,

22:02.004 --> 22:04.755
than I ever did to my surviving son.

22:04.757 --> 22:08.142
You remember him? William?

22:08.177 --> 22:11.762
The son you ordered me to put to death?

22:18.104 --> 22:21.572
But the day I left William
out in the desert was the day

22:21.607 --> 22:25.609
that I destroyed the last
piece of hope in myself.

22:29.365 --> 22:34.118
I just wasn't honest enough
to lie down and stop breathing.

22:34.170 --> 22:38.205
I am sorry for everything I have done.

22:42.295 --> 22:43.878
I hate you.

22:51.854 --> 22:55.389
You're not worth it.

23:02.815 --> 23:05.199
Oh, shit.

23:14.794 --> 23:17.912
They're over by the Luxor.
That's outside the walls.

23:17.964 --> 23:19.413
They can stay there as long as they like.

23:19.465 --> 23:22.633
- Who cares?
- We do.

23:22.668 --> 23:24.468
There's a tunnel right underneath that bus

23:24.503 --> 23:27.388
that leads straight into Vega.

23:27.423 --> 23:28.672
Uh-oh.

23:58.871 --> 24:01.705
All I did, I did for you,

24:01.707 --> 24:06.593
to keep our family whole,
and to keep you by my side.

24:11.183 --> 24:14.268
Please, wait. Stay with me.

24:14.303 --> 24:16.136
- Where are you going?
- To find the Chosen One.

24:16.188 --> 24:18.355
There is no Chosen One! Damn the prophecy!

24:18.391 --> 24:19.773
He's destined to be a savior!

24:19.809 --> 24:21.725
Or a destroyer. Don't forget that.

24:21.777 --> 24:23.110
And that's why we must guide him.

24:23.145 --> 24:25.362
Noma, go! Find him.

24:25.398 --> 24:27.231
Michael, please. What are you doing?

24:27.233 --> 24:29.900
It's too late. The lower angels are here.

24:29.952 --> 24:32.536
- Their work will soon be done.
- Then you have to stop them.

24:32.571 --> 24:36.206
- No, never!
- Then I will.

24:36.242 --> 24:37.574
We were meant to work together!

24:37.576 --> 24:39.243
Why don't you believe me?

24:39.295 --> 24:41.412
What you've done cannot be undone.

24:41.464 --> 24:43.330
The child's our only hope now.

24:43.382 --> 24:44.915
I cannot do this alone!

24:44.967 --> 24:46.083
I need you.

24:46.135 --> 24:47.668
Don't leave me.

24:47.720 --> 24:49.837
You brought this on yourself.

24:49.889 --> 24:53.257
Michael! Mike!

25:12.328 --> 25:15.279
What's taking so long to
get the wall guns working?

25:15.281 --> 25:17.081
- _
- Shit. The system froze.

25:17.116 --> 25:20.250
Lucky for us we have a
Comms Officer on deck.

25:22.872 --> 25:24.338
Can you help us?

25:24.373 --> 25:26.457
You're the Lady of the City.

25:26.509 --> 25:28.709
This is no time to stand
on ceremony, soldier.

25:28.761 --> 25:30.711
- Get your butt over there.
- Look, I don't know if I have...

25:30.763 --> 25:32.296
- I'm serious. Sit down.
- This?

25:32.348 --> 25:33.347
Go!

25:33.382 --> 25:34.431
This is way above my pay grade.

25:34.467 --> 25:36.183
Well, consider yourself promoted.

25:36.218 --> 25:39.103
- Can you do it?
- I'll try.

25:39.138 --> 25:41.638
Come on, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, calm down.

25:41.690 --> 25:43.474
We'll do this together.

25:43.526 --> 25:44.725
Where are you going?

25:44.777 --> 25:46.810
Communications are down.
I need to tell Alex.

25:46.862 --> 25:48.479
We can stop them breaking
through the tunnel.

25:48.531 --> 25:51.315
And David, I need those
cannons up and working.

25:51.367 --> 25:53.367
- Can I trust you?
- Yes, you can.

25:57.206 --> 25:59.239
Okay, what's your name, son?

25:59.291 --> 26:00.791
Jerry.

26:00.826 --> 26:03.160
Well, Jerry, you heard her.

26:03.162 --> 26:06.046
We need to get these cannons online.

26:06.082 --> 26:08.382
It's our only hope.

26:24.434 --> 26:26.584
Daria?

26:26.619 --> 26:28.185
Are you...

26:28.237 --> 26:31.822
Dr. Eli, are you okay? Where's Daria?

26:31.858 --> 26:34.825
Gone. She ran out of here screaming.

26:34.861 --> 26:38.245
What happened? What are we gonna do?

26:38.281 --> 26:40.865
We're going home.

26:46.873 --> 26:49.256
- Claire, what is it?
- New problem.

26:49.292 --> 26:51.509
There's a tunnel that
runs underneath the Luxor

26:51.544 --> 26:52.793
directly into Vega.

26:52.845 --> 26:54.378
- Let me guess. The eight
- balls found it?

26:54.430 --> 26:55.713
Yeah. There's a gate in the middle,

26:55.715 --> 26:58.015
but it's not gonna last long. Let's go.

26:58.051 --> 27:00.217
Yeah, I'm gonna need a bigger gun.

27:00.219 --> 27:01.886
- Hold on.
- Hold on what?

27:01.888 --> 27:03.220
I'm not staying here.

27:03.222 --> 27:04.555
Claire, you're wounded.

27:04.607 --> 27:08.893
There are eight-balls at
our walls, in the tunnels.

27:08.895 --> 27:10.227
You're gonna need me.

27:10.279 --> 27:12.563
Let's move.

27:15.652 --> 27:20.955
Listen, Claire, I swore
an oath to protect Alex,

27:20.990 --> 27:22.239
but it's more than just an oath.

27:22.291 --> 27:23.407
Yeah, I get that.

27:23.409 --> 27:25.660
Look, if something happens,

27:25.712 --> 27:27.795
- if I fail him...
- You won't.

27:27.830 --> 27:32.049
Yeah, but if I do, I need to
know that you'll do anything

27:32.085 --> 27:33.300
to make sure Alex is safe.

27:33.336 --> 27:36.087
I will. Anything.

27:36.089 --> 27:38.005
Let's go, let's go!

27:41.561 --> 27:42.843
How's it going?

27:42.895 --> 27:46.480
Uh, it's complicated.

27:46.516 --> 27:47.848
Uh...

27:47.900 --> 27:50.518
Wall cannons activated.

27:53.106 --> 27:54.655
We're online?

27:54.691 --> 27:55.940
Yes, we are.

27:55.992 --> 27:57.274
Now what?

27:57.326 --> 27:59.110
Now we bitch-slap some eight-balls.

27:59.112 --> 28:00.444
I can do that.

28:00.446 --> 28:02.329
- Can I do that?
- This one's yours.

28:02.365 --> 28:04.832
It's easy, just... you move
the target with your finger

28:04.867 --> 28:05.950
and hit the red "fire" button.

28:06.002 --> 28:07.201
All the cannons are fully loaded.

28:07.253 --> 28:08.836
That's your side.

28:08.871 --> 28:11.088
Oh, okay. Okay.

28:11.124 --> 28:12.540
Turn the console on.

28:12.592 --> 28:14.542
Um, oh...

28:14.594 --> 28:16.544
Line up the target with your finger

28:16.596 --> 28:18.713
and hit the red "fire" button.

28:20.600 --> 28:21.799
Ha!

28:21.851 --> 28:23.801
You're a natural, Consul.

28:23.803 --> 28:25.136
Well, thank you, Jerry.

28:25.188 --> 28:27.221
Keep shooting.

28:37.483 --> 28:40.317
I begged you to stay!

28:58.554 --> 29:02.506
When you left the bar that
day everything changed.

29:02.558 --> 29:05.426
My angels had come to wipe out the planet.

29:05.478 --> 29:07.678
It was meant to be an extinction event,

29:07.680 --> 29:09.847
but oh, no,

29:09.849 --> 29:13.684
you crossed sides and made it a war,

29:13.686 --> 29:15.653
and I get the blame.

29:15.688 --> 29:21.358
All my angels came to my
side but you, my own brother.

29:21.410 --> 29:24.862
You left me when I needed you most.

29:24.864 --> 29:27.915
You broke our family apart.

29:27.950 --> 29:32.703
No, it was already broken...

29:32.755 --> 29:36.090
by another...

29:36.125 --> 29:39.126
the archangel who chose humanity first,

29:39.178 --> 29:42.429
long before I did.

29:42.465 --> 29:45.266
Our brother is alive.

29:45.301 --> 29:49.053
No.

29:53.226 --> 29:56.644
The universe is rather vast.

29:56.696 --> 30:01.148
I've searched but never found its end.

30:01.200 --> 30:05.903
It's a magnificent thing
but daunting in its breadth.

30:08.074 --> 30:12.243
And yet never once have I felt alone...

30:14.497 --> 30:16.747
Until now.

30:20.753 --> 30:24.255
That was fast.

30:24.257 --> 30:28.175
The trail led to a house.

30:28.227 --> 30:29.426
And Michael?

30:29.478 --> 30:32.680
I sent him in the wrong direction.

30:32.732 --> 30:35.850
That serves him right for trusting you,

30:35.902 --> 30:38.352
but we know better, don't we?

30:38.404 --> 30:42.606
This is the only way to
bring our Father back.

30:42.658 --> 30:45.242
Take me to the child.

30:45.278 --> 30:47.444
What are we gonna do with him?

30:47.446 --> 30:50.331
Why, kill him, of course.

30:50.366 --> 30:54.201
When the boy is gone
Michael will come back to me.

31:04.847 --> 31:06.547
Check this out.

31:07.967 --> 31:09.049
Down they go!

31:10.853 --> 31:12.636
There is a perverse kind of joy

31:12.688 --> 31:15.472
in seeing them blown apart, isn't there?

31:18.311 --> 31:20.811
Hey!

31:20.813 --> 31:23.647
Oh, I think I might have missed my calling.

31:23.699 --> 31:25.482
Me...

31:33.876 --> 31:34.875
Hello, Daddy.

31:38.034 --> 31:39.900
- Claire's at my back.
- Got it.

31:48.211 --> 31:50.578
Be careful. These halls aren't safe.

32:00.556 --> 32:03.924
My Queen, we don't have
time for this, please.

32:06.262 --> 32:08.929
Don't leave, please.

32:08.981 --> 32:12.433
She's Vega's problem, not
ours, collateral damage.

32:12.485 --> 32:14.101
Helena is the only thing that matters.

32:14.153 --> 32:16.270
We must fly.

32:16.272 --> 32:18.606
You sound like someone I used to know.

32:18.608 --> 32:19.907
Who?

32:19.942 --> 32:24.745
Me.

32:24.780 --> 32:28.165
Come.

32:28.201 --> 32:29.450
Take her with you to the helicopter.

32:29.502 --> 32:31.118
- But...
- Now.

32:39.462 --> 32:43.013
Gabriel, please listen to me.

32:43.049 --> 32:46.016
Our brother is alive.

32:51.557 --> 32:52.857
What did you say?

32:52.892 --> 32:57.478
The Son of Morning, he lives.

33:01.067 --> 33:02.316
Lucifer?

33:08.875 --> 33:10.908
Fan out!

33:14.380 --> 33:15.329
Stay close.

33:20.920 --> 33:22.887
They're gonna break through!

33:22.922 --> 33:26.307
The gate's not gonna hold much longer.

33:29.679 --> 33:35.516
There's a town called Mallory...

33:35.518 --> 33:37.851
untouched by the war,

33:37.853 --> 33:40.404
and the people there, they hear a voice,

33:40.439 --> 33:45.442
and they think it's
God, but it's not Father.

33:45.494 --> 33:49.530
I think Lucifer's the one responsible,

33:49.582 --> 33:51.165
but I don't know how.

33:51.200 --> 33:54.335
No.

33:54.370 --> 33:59.423
Gabriel, I met a man who
claims to work for him,

33:59.458 --> 34:01.208
and Alex has a new marking.

34:01.210 --> 34:04.545
A marking of what?

34:04.547 --> 34:05.629
Tell me.

34:11.053 --> 34:14.804
What did you do?

34:14.857 --> 34:16.306
I thought I was the Chosen One,

34:16.359 --> 34:19.860
but turns out I'm not.

34:19.895 --> 34:23.112
Alex Lannon is the Chosen One.

34:23.149 --> 34:27.534
He stole everything from me...

34:27.570 --> 34:31.405
my wife, my destiny.

34:31.456 --> 34:36.659
This man who you just killed
was helping to defend our city.

34:36.712 --> 34:39.380
We were stopping eight-balls at the wall.

34:39.415 --> 34:41.248
Gabriel, Claire,

34:41.250 --> 34:46.253
and Alex all came to me,
stripped me of my illusions.

34:46.255 --> 34:49.389
I wasn't saved by God.

34:49.425 --> 34:51.925
I wasn't special.

34:51.927 --> 34:55.262
I'm not worthy!

34:55.313 --> 34:57.097
It was just a story I made up.

34:57.099 --> 34:59.767
William, what you saw, that... that was...

34:59.819 --> 35:00.851
that was the illusion.

35:00.903 --> 35:02.319
It was like a nightmare.

35:02.355 --> 35:05.489
No, it's okay. It was necessary.

35:05.524 --> 35:07.157
I've realized it doesn't matter

35:07.193 --> 35:10.194
that I'm just a man.

35:13.199 --> 35:15.916
I can still fight evil.

35:21.957 --> 35:24.758
- Tell me you got a plan.
- My plan?

35:24.794 --> 35:26.794
To make it out of this city one last time.

35:26.846 --> 35:28.429
Outside these walls?

35:28.464 --> 35:31.382
Are you crazy?

35:31.434 --> 35:34.051
Desert dandelions in full bloom.

35:34.103 --> 35:35.436
- You want to see them, right?
- Yeah!

35:35.471 --> 35:37.971
So we jump in the truck, hit the open road,

35:38.024 --> 35:40.391
and never look back, eh?

35:40.443 --> 35:43.277
Like we always planned.

35:43.312 --> 35:45.946
Seems like a lifetime ago.

35:45.981 --> 35:48.782
Doesn't have to be. All
we need is the truck.

35:51.987 --> 35:54.488
William, you need help.

35:54.490 --> 35:58.042
I returned to this city
to cleanse troubled hearts.

35:58.077 --> 35:59.326
Look at me, please.

35:59.378 --> 36:02.663
But there's just so much sin.

36:02.715 --> 36:04.164
You don't know what you're saying, son.

36:04.166 --> 36:08.335
It's in all of them, too
much for me to cleanse.

36:08.387 --> 36:10.671
Give me the gun, please.

36:10.723 --> 36:13.724
The only cure is to kill them all.

36:13.759 --> 36:14.842
What do you mean? No.

36:14.894 --> 36:16.093
What do you think you're doing?

36:16.145 --> 36:20.180
Don't you see? Everyone in Vega must die.

36:20.232 --> 36:23.100
That's the only way we can save them.

36:23.152 --> 36:25.519
William, I know this is hard
to believe, but I want to help.

36:25.521 --> 36:28.021
Like you helped me by leaving
me to die in the desert?

36:28.023 --> 36:30.607
And I have regretted
it every single moment.

36:30.659 --> 36:33.994
Why do I doubt that?

36:34.029 --> 36:37.364
Because of every lie I told
you and every mistake I made,

36:37.366 --> 36:40.084
but now I am telling the truth.

36:40.119 --> 36:42.252
I never should've left you in that desert.

36:47.176 --> 36:51.678
I appreciate your effort,
I do, but it's too late.

36:51.714 --> 36:53.213
I'm opening the gates.

36:53.265 --> 36:54.681
No, it's never too late. Never too late.

36:54.717 --> 36:56.884
Look, you... you can't do this, please.

36:56.886 --> 36:58.469
Step away from the console.

36:58.521 --> 37:00.854
Please, step away.

37:00.890 --> 37:03.941
- Do you forgive me, Father?
- Step away now.

37:03.976 --> 37:06.193
- I forgive you.
- William, no!

37:17.957 --> 37:19.607
Let's go!

37:25.413 --> 37:28.715
Tell me about your Chosen One.

37:28.750 --> 37:30.550
Gabriel, please listen.

37:30.585 --> 37:32.886
Alex's marking, I've seen it.

37:32.921 --> 37:34.470
It's the Morning Star.

37:34.506 --> 37:35.755
Impossible.

37:35.757 --> 37:40.393
We annihilated him, you,
me, Raphael, and Uriel.

37:40.428 --> 37:44.097
We did as Father commanded,

37:44.099 --> 37:46.733
but I think he survived,

37:46.768 --> 37:49.602
and now I fear he wants Alex.

37:49.604 --> 37:52.105
Alex? Why?

37:52.157 --> 37:57.110
I don't know, but if I'm
right and this is Lucifer,

37:57.112 --> 38:00.496
he's gonna remember what
you and I did to him.

38:00.532 --> 38:05.201
He was our first, the most powerful of us.

38:05.253 --> 38:08.037
If he lives, there's no telling

38:08.089 --> 38:11.124
what shape his vengeance will take.

38:11.126 --> 38:14.027
Hmm.

38:24.105 --> 38:28.558
I won't let you kill everyone in this city.

38:33.648 --> 38:35.815
- Get off!
- Aah!

38:38.236 --> 38:39.619
No, William!

38:52.834 --> 38:56.219
Oh, forgive me, please.

38:56.254 --> 38:58.671
Everyone in Vega must die.

38:58.723 --> 39:00.256
I love you!

39:02.677 --> 39:04.260
No!

39:11.319 --> 39:14.153
I always loved you.

39:14.189 --> 39:19.192
No... you didn't.

39:33.174 --> 39:35.925
You can't defeat Lucifer alone, Gabriel.

39:35.960 --> 39:38.378
We must face him together!

39:38.380 --> 39:40.513
I don't believe you, Michael.

39:40.548 --> 39:43.716
I dare not.

39:43.718 --> 39:48.554
But if there is even a
chance that Lucifer is alive,

39:48.606 --> 39:51.357
best I go to this town you speak of

39:51.393 --> 39:53.393
and find out for myself.

39:57.532 --> 39:59.065
But I won't be going alone.

40:07.876 --> 40:09.409
We're running out of ammo!

40:12.163 --> 40:15.164
Alex, there's too many of them!

40:15.216 --> 40:17.383
I'm out!

40:17.419 --> 40:19.419
Lannon, what are you doing?
