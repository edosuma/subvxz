tales are right now, right?

You got those TV shows,

00:13.933 --> 00:16.268
What's your guys' favorite fairy tale?

00:16.268 --> 00:17.902
- Um...
- "Old Mother Goose."

00:17.905 --> 00:19.603
Probably something' with
a little bit more action,

00:19.606 --> 00:21.239
adventure, "Jack and the Beanstalk."

00:21.240 --> 00:22.574
Great fairy tale.

00:22.576 --> 00:24.141
You know, and Jack sells
his cow for magic beans,

00:24.143 --> 00:25.943
gets a big beanstalk, goes up,

00:25.946 --> 00:28.146
meets a big giant, steals a golden egg,

00:28.147 --> 00:30.082
comes down, chops down the
beanstalk, kills the giant.

00:30.083 --> 00:31.783
- I'm familiar with the story.
- Okay, sorry. I didn't...

00:31.785 --> 00:33.118
Are you sure you don't
wanna sit on his knee

00:33.119 --> 00:34.453

00:34.454 --> 00:36.320
[laughter]

00:36.323 --> 00:38.356
Why kill the giant, though? What did he do?

00:38.357 --> 00:39.758
He was stealin' from the village.

00:39.759 --> 00:41.093
- Was he?
- Yeah.

00:41.094 --> 00:42.460
He screwed up by sellin' the cow.

00:42.463 --> 00:43.962
Who, Jack?

00:43.963 --> 00:45.630
Yeah, he was, you know, labeled an idiot.

00:45.631 --> 00:47.631
He had to make up for it. It's a metaphor.

00:47.634 --> 00:50.801
We've all, in our youth,
have done something so stupid.

00:50.804 --> 00:54.472
You know, that time you bought a scorpion,
and your dad kicked your ass.

00:54.475 --> 00:56.307
- Right. Mm-hmm.
- Right.

00:56.310 --> 00:58.877
'Cause I didn't pay my
telephone bill with the money,

00:58.878 --> 01:00.512
instead bought a scorpion.

01:00.514 --> 01:02.680
He was the giant I needed to defeat.

01:02.682 --> 01:04.649
That could be a fairy tale right there.

01:04.650 --> 01:07.218
- No, no...
- A modern-day fairy tale.

01:07.221 --> 01:08.954
I shoulda turned tail when I heard him say,

01:08.956 --> 01:12.224

- $1,000?
- 1,000 bucks.

could do $1,000 on it, though.

08:34.236 --> 08:36.004
- Brilliant scientist...
- Okay, right.

08:36.005 --> 08:37.404
Excellent with magic.

08:37.407 --> 08:39.974
He rules over Latveria with an iron fist,

08:39.975 --> 08:41.576
and he just wants to rule the world.

08:41.577 --> 08:43.912
There is no one above Doom

08:43.913 --> 08:47.148
in terms of, like, the
ultimate Marvel villain.

08:47.149 --> 08:49.683
Doctor Doom, one of my favorite doctors,

08:49.686 --> 08:50.918
not a real doctor.

08:50.921 --> 08:53.988
Is Doctor Doom the be-all baddie

08:53.990 --> 08:55.255
in the Marvel universe?

08:55.258 --> 08:56.825
Is there anybody that trumps Doom?

08:56.826 --> 08:58.393
You're tempted to say Magneto,

08:58.394 --> 09:00.894
but he wavers back and
forth between the line

09:00.897 --> 09:02.563
of good guy and bad guy.

09:02.566 --> 09:06.033
Doom is just, "I'm bad
for the sake of bad."

09:06.035 --> 09:08.870
Yeah, he's the face of
villainy in the Marvel universe.

09:08.871 --> 09:10.337
Or the lack of face.

09:10.340 --> 09:12.506

09:12.509 --> 09:14.109
Well, why are you sellin'
this, then, if you're...

09:14.110 --> 09:15.876
Well, I love the character.

09:15.879 --> 09:18.212
What I don't love is maintaining
the character's armor.

09:18.215 --> 09:19.780
It's very stuffy under there,

09:19.783 --> 09:22.417
and after a couple hours,
I'm done at a convention.

09:22.418 --> 09:24.158
- Gets tough.
- Can I put this on?

09:24.158 --> 09:25.886
- Yeah.
- All right.

09:29.057 --> 09:30.557
He's got a little pea head.

09:30.559 --> 09:31.625
It doesn't fit him.

09:31.628 --> 09:32.894
I'm surrounded by idiots!

09:32.895 --> 09:34.528
That's... that's terrifying.

09:34.530 --> 09:35.897
[laughter]

09:35.899 --> 09:37.264
That's one of his lines, right?

09:37.267 --> 09:38.533
- "I'm surrounded by idiots"?
- Yeah.

09:38.534 --> 09:40.701
No. Who was he talkin' to?

09:40.703 --> 09:42.803
- Uh, the idiots.
- Try "kneel before Doom."

09:42.806 --> 09:44.438
Kneel before Doom!

09:44.441 --> 09:46.140
Moron, take it off.

09:46.143 --> 09:47.642
You don't deserve to wear the helmet

09:47.644 --> 09:49.411
if you have to, like,
pad it with newspapers

09:49.413 --> 09:51.044
so that it fits on your head correctly.

09:51.047 --> 09:54.215
[laughter]

09:54.216 --> 09:56.283
One of the coolest things
about that character,

09:56.286 --> 09:58.720
I always dug is, they did one story

09:58.721 --> 10:01.389
where they took off the
mask, and he was beautiful

10:01.390 --> 10:03.924
except for one tiny blemish right here.

10:03.927 --> 10:06.794
And so all those years he
was like, "I'm a monster,"

10:06.797 --> 10:09.096
it was just his own vanity and ego.

10:09.099 --> 10:11.065
I usually don't go after

10:11.067 --> 10:13.802
non-licensed pieces of merchandise.

10:13.803 --> 10:15.669
But this is so cool, you know?

10:15.672 --> 10:18.740
So what are you looki" to get for it?

10:18.741 --> 10:19.974
$400?

10:19.975 --> 10:22.443
Um, $400, huh?

10:24.013 --> 10:25.679
Would you take $200 for it?

10:25.682 --> 10:28.750
$350?

10:28.751 --> 10:30.652
$275?

10:30.653 --> 10:32.921
$300.

10:32.923 --> 10:34.355
All right, $300.

10:34.356 --> 10:37.826

10:37.827 --> 10:39.326

11:10.167 --> 11:11.466

11:11.467 --> 11:13.392
Ooh, um...

What about you, Ming?

- No!

11:51.864 --> 11:53.264

11:53.265 --> 11:54.865
I want a second opinion

11:54.866 --> 11:56.767

12:08.640 --> 12:10.240
How do you think life would be different

12:10.241 --> 12:11.975

12:11.976 --> 12:13.610
You'd be in jail, for one.

12:13.611 --> 12:15.077
I mean, I think we all would, right?

12:15.080 --> 12:17.279
Maybe not. Only the act would be a crime.

12:17.282 --> 12:19.282
So all those things he thinks about, yeah,

12:19.283 --> 12:22.219
they'd be... they'd be
disgusted and appalled

12:22.221 --> 12:24.453
and absolutely wanna, like, just, like,

12:24.456 --> 12:26.822

thinking about this crime

12:36.335 --> 12:37.600
that he's about to commit?

12:44.676 --> 12:45.942
Oh, yeah, people would be like,

12:45.943 --> 12:47.476
"Um, I thought he was a nice guy,

12:47.479 --> 12:50.980

16:54.393 --> 16:55.424
Whoa.

16:58.261 --> 16:59.663
Oh, my God.

17:05.583 --> 17:06.883
Go ahead.

17:06.884 --> 17:08.770
- After you.
- Thank you. [exhales]

17:09.721 --> 17:11.554
I thought you were kiddin'
around about this place.

17:11.556 --> 17:12.755
Whoa.

17:15.526 --> 17:17.160
"Are you prepared?"

17:17.162 --> 17:18.862
Well, no, but that's why we're here, right?

17:18.864 --> 17:21.230
- Yeah.
- Hey, guys. How are we?

17:21.232 --> 17:22.932
- I'm Frank.
- Hey.

17:22.933 --> 17:24.665
- Hey, Frank, how you doin'?
- What can I do for you?

17:24.669 --> 17:27.069
We're here today to get prepared

17:27.070 --> 17:28.938
for the apocalypse, if need be.

17:28.940 --> 17:31.273
We went to a store that had everything

17:31.276 --> 17:34.376
you will need to survive,
you know, doomsday.

17:34.378 --> 17:37.779
You're gonna need food, water,
weapons... the big three.

17:37.781 --> 17:39.682
Okay, all right, that's
what we're here for.

17:39.683 --> 17:41.851
We're here for... we're here
for your expertise today.

17:41.853 --> 17:43.019
You tell us what we need.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.520
We're here to buy it.

17:44.522 --> 17:46.588
Lemme show you around.

17:46.590 --> 17:48.892
Water, food, and weapons.

17:48.894 --> 17:51.627
I did leave out one big
thing, and that's air.

17:51.630 --> 17:54.029
Gas masks are very important.

17:54.031 --> 17:57.366
NBC... nuclear, biological, and chemical.

17:57.368 --> 17:59.201
We don't know where it's comin' from.

17:59.203 --> 18:00.537
We just know it's comin'.

18:00.538 --> 18:02.105
What would be biological?

18:02.106 --> 18:03.873
- Pbbt.
- A dirty bomb...

18:03.875 --> 18:05.708
[laughter]

18:05.710 --> 18:07.710
I was afraid that's
what it was, and I've...

18:07.711 --> 18:11.446
After livin' together for four weeks,
you might wanna just walk around with them.

18:11.449 --> 18:13.148
- And I think... Exactly.
- [laughter]

18:13.151 --> 18:15.417
Exactly.

18:15.420 --> 18:17.487
The food is your most important thing.

18:17.489 --> 18:19.087
These are food bars.

18:19.089 --> 18:22.424
1,200 calories is considered
one-day survival bar

18:22.426 --> 18:23.792
for one person.

18:23.795 --> 18:25.994
Break off a piece.
These are non-thirsting,

18:25.997 --> 18:28.631
Coast Guard-approved survival bars.

18:28.633 --> 18:30.633
Cool.

18:30.634 --> 18:32.902
- Ooh.
- Whoa.

18:32.903 --> 18:34.604
Look at how good that looks.

18:34.605 --> 18:37.173
If you had to, could you eat this?

18:37.174 --> 18:38.674
Of course.

18:38.676 --> 18:40.009
But I don't have to
right now, right, Frank?

18:40.010 --> 18:41.477
You don't have to.

18:41.479 --> 18:42.979
Right now, you can go get a hamburger.

18:42.980 --> 18:44.846
[laughter]

18:46.951 --> 18:48.417
The biggest thing that I sell...

18:48.420 --> 18:50.586
- Oh, my God.
- [laughs]

18:50.588 --> 18:52.521
Little plastic toilet buckets.

18:52.523 --> 18:54.123
Oh, my God.

18:54.125 --> 18:56.092
I don't know if I'm prepared to do that.

18:56.094 --> 18:58.027
Do you sell, like, a
privacy curtain or something?

18:58.028 --> 18:59.596
'Cause we're gonna be,
what, we're gonna be right

18:59.597 --> 19:01.130
down here goin' in a bucket in front of...

19:01.132 --> 19:03.199
I have tarps. We can cut tarps and... yeah.

19:03.201 --> 19:05.134
It's what you make out of it.

19:05.135 --> 19:06.935
We're gonna see sides of each other

19:06.938 --> 19:09.638
that we never woulda sh...
Ever would've revealed.

19:09.641 --> 19:10.807
Mostly backsides.

19:10.808 --> 19:13.175
[laughter]

19:13.178 --> 19:14.777
Now, we can joke about doomsday,

19:14.778 --> 19:17.880
but when it hits you in
the face and you realize,

19:17.882 --> 19:20.717
for the rest of your life, you may be doing

19:20.719 --> 19:23.720
one or two in a bucket,
it really hits home.

19:23.721 --> 19:24.854
And this ain't "The Walking Dead."

19:24.855 --> 19:26.689
- This ain't TV.
- No.

19:26.691 --> 19:29.558
TV don't have, uh, you know,
people starin' at you, like,

19:29.560 --> 19:30.692
"You done with that bucket yet?"

19:30.694 --> 19:32.060
- Yeah.
- You know?

19:32.063 --> 19:34.564
It is going to be a rough, rough ride.

19:34.566 --> 19:37.165
It's going to be a hellish world of people

19:37.167 --> 19:39.067
looking at each other while they're trying

19:39.069 --> 19:40.702
to defecate in buckets.

19:40.704 --> 19:43.472
[laughter]

19:43.474 --> 19:44.874
These are great.

19:44.875 --> 19:48.377
These are basically what the police use.

19:48.380 --> 19:49.912
- Ooh.
- Oh.

19:49.913 --> 19:51.913
It's pretty heavy steel.

19:51.915 --> 19:53.583
Right there?

19:53.585 --> 19:55.151
- There, there.
- That's pretty solid.

19:55.153 --> 19:57.386
Yeah, it's not breaking leg time.

19:57.388 --> 19:58.921
It's time to...

19:58.923 --> 20:00.890
- It's time to break necks.
- Yeah, yeah.

20:00.892 --> 20:02.090
You're a pretty grim dude, Frank.

20:02.093 --> 20:04.192
- [laughs]
- Yeah.

20:04.194 --> 20:06.429
If I was throwin' a party, I
don't know if I'd invite Frank.

20:06.431 --> 20:10.365
- Nobody does.
- [laughter]

20:11.734 --> 20:14.369
What are you gonna do?

20:14.372 --> 20:15.938
So we got all our supplies,

20:15.940 --> 20:18.708
just everything you'll need, we got it.

20:18.710 --> 20:20.676
Better to have a plan and not need it

20:20.679 --> 20:22.778
than need a plan and not have it.

20:22.780 --> 20:26.382
You guys drank the Kool-Aid,
man, the freeze-dried Kool-Aid.

20:26.384 --> 20:28.183
[laughter]

20:28.185 --> 20:30.118
He was a slap across the face

20:30.121 --> 20:31.921
that I think a lot of us need, maybe you.

20:31.923 --> 20:33.221
'Cause it doesn't sound like

20:33.223 --> 20:34.790
you're takin' this too seriously.

20:34.792 --> 20:36.459
I really have a hard time doin' it, man.

20:36.461 --> 20:39.528
But I don't have a hard
time understanding how a guy

20:39.530 --> 20:41.096
who runs a survivalist store

20:41.098 --> 20:42.731
doesn't really have a sense of humor.

20:42.733 --> 20:45.268
[laughter]

20:45.269 --> 20:47.269
Oh, man, that's all the
time we got for this week.

20:47.271 --> 20:48.570
We gotta go.

20:48.573 --> 20:49.939
"Comic Book Men," I'm Kevin Smith.

20:49.941 --> 20:51.540
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

20:51.542 --> 20:53.041
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

20:53.044 --> 20:55.877
Remember, kids, sometimes dead is betta.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.079
Good night.
