WEBVTT

00:03.320 --> 00:05.360
Wow, John.

00:05.380 --> 00:09.100
A bike trip through wine
country sounds amazing.

00:09.320 --> 00:12.300
Maybe next we'll take a wine
trip through bike country.

00:12.388 --> 00:14.805
No, I'm kidding.

00:14.933 --> 00:17.016
I know there's no bike country.

00:17.140 --> 00:18.760
Oh, there is?

00:18.820 --> 00:20.140
Oh!

00:20.480 --> 00:22.340
Now you're kidding.

00:22.400 --> 00:25.300
Oh, I miss you. Mwah, mwah, mwah.

00:25.320 --> 00:26.500
Bye-bye.

00:26.530 --> 00:30.490
Charlie, will you just
shoot me in the head?

00:30.620 --> 00:33.080
Now? Can I have your bacon first?

00:34.330 --> 00:36.980
I can't take a bike trip.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.840
Oh, honey, 'cause your feet
won't reach the pedals?

00:40.960 --> 00:44.090
My feet's about to reach your face.

00:44.340 --> 00:47.450
I never learned to ride a bike, okay?

00:47.480 --> 00:48.600
Who cares?

00:48.620 --> 00:51.640
Nothing sadder than a
grown man riding a bike.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.270
Well, Rollerblades, I guess.

00:54.390 --> 00:57.730
That said, what grown man doesn't
know how to ride a bike?

00:57.850 --> 00:59.980
I never learned.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.100
I got my first bicycle when I was six.

01:02.120 --> 01:04.690
I traded it in for a canopy bed.

01:04.819 --> 01:07.500
I never got another one. Bike, that is.

01:07.590 --> 01:10.370
I'm on my ninth canopy bed.

01:10.700 --> 01:12.840
So just tell John the truth.

01:12.860 --> 01:14.840
I mean, I showed Kathleen my toes,

01:14.860 --> 01:17.040
and I think she'll get over it.

01:17.160 --> 01:20.120
I can't tell John the truth.
We just started dating.

01:20.200 --> 01:23.060
I have to be the perfect
version of myself.

01:23.120 --> 01:27.020
Sid's right. Early on, you got
to put your best foot forward.

01:27.080 --> 01:29.140
I once held in a fart for a year.

01:30.990 --> 01:34.610
When he finally dumped me,
boy, did I let 'er rip.

01:34.700 --> 01:37.160
Scared the hell out of my dog.

01:37.280 --> 01:39.760
Great, Margaret.

01:39.820 --> 01:43.620
Now I have something else
I got to worry about.

01:43.720 --> 01:45.700
I'm on it.

01:48.300 --> 01:50.220
Here's your beer, Mr. Hank.

01:50.240 --> 01:51.340
Thank you, Ernie.

01:51.400 --> 01:53.700
I assume you vacuumed as well?

01:53.720 --> 01:56.200
Yes, Mr. Hank. Even under the bed.

01:56.240 --> 01:58.320
Mm. Well, just keep in
mind, some of that stuff

01:58.350 --> 01:59.900
was there when I moved in.

01:59.920 --> 02:02.040
Wait, hold on. Who is this kid,

02:02.060 --> 02:05.100
and when was he here
taking drink orders?

02:05.230 --> 02:07.400
This is Ernie. I'm his mentor.

02:07.480 --> 02:08.940
You're mentoring someone?

02:08.960 --> 02:12.320
Do people need to be taught
to be bitter and alone?

02:13.120 --> 02:15.100
Ernie, never bring her a beer.

02:15.360 --> 02:16.660
You may go.

02:18.660 --> 02:21.440
Shady Meadows does a program
with the local high school.

02:21.460 --> 02:23.660
See, me and Ernie, we supposed
to learn from each other,

02:23.680 --> 02:25.250
but since I already know everything,

02:25.370 --> 02:27.460
I've been teaching him
the ways of the world.

02:27.470 --> 02:28.860
Well, that's ridiculous.

02:28.880 --> 02:30.800
You're just using this kid.

02:30.820 --> 02:32.800
I mean, if anybody should
mentor him, it should be me.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.590
I am wise as crap.

02:36.080 --> 02:38.970
Margaret, it's called a men-torship,

02:39.100 --> 02:41.720
not a woman-torship.

02:41.850 --> 02:43.680
Come on, I'm looking out for him.

02:43.810 --> 02:45.370
Do you have any idea

02:45.400 --> 02:48.690
how treacherous high
school is for a nerd?

02:48.810 --> 02:51.650
This doofus actually
wanted to go to the prom.

02:51.780 --> 02:53.070
Well, what's wrong with that?

02:53.100 --> 02:55.690
What is he, a bad dancer or something?

02:55.820 --> 02:58.820
Is he a bad dancer?

02:58.950 --> 03:02.120
Margaret, did you look at him?

03:02.200 --> 03:04.750
I'm gonna guarantee he is a bad dancer.

03:04.770 --> 03:06.000
Well, that's just crazy.

03:06.020 --> 03:08.250
He needs to go to prom. It's the best.

03:08.380 --> 03:11.130
Making out with your
date on the dance floor.

03:11.250 --> 03:14.080
Banging the guy that you really
wanted to go with after.

03:15.380 --> 03:17.740
Did I ever tell you I
was the prom queen?

03:17.760 --> 03:19.220
Yes, you did, the day we met.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.930
I believe it was right
after, "Hi. I'm Margaret."

03:22.060 --> 03:24.300
Look, I was cool in high school.

03:24.330 --> 03:26.380
Ernie is not.

03:26.440 --> 03:29.050
I think it best he just
skip the prom and stay here

03:29.080 --> 03:30.980
so he can alphabetize my colognes.

03:31.110 --> 03:32.940
Your colognes? What do...

03:33.070 --> 03:35.160
You pay for that smell?

03:37.000 --> 03:43.074

03:59.220 --> 04:02.340
I figured it'd be best to
practice on a stationary bike

04:02.360 --> 04:04.050
before you get on the real thing.

04:04.180 --> 04:07.930
I owe my six-pack to this baby.

04:08.060 --> 04:10.270
Maybe I don't need to
learn to ride a bike.

04:10.350 --> 04:11.820
It's just gonna be a matter of time

04:11.840 --> 04:14.650
before John figures out that
we are not a good match.

04:14.780 --> 04:17.480
He's active and fit. And me?

04:17.610 --> 04:20.300
I can't even touch my
toes, and they're, like,

04:20.320 --> 04:22.160
right there.

04:22.280 --> 04:24.750
Look, Sid, you're out
of your comfort zone.

04:24.780 --> 04:27.040
That happens with a new relationship.

04:27.060 --> 04:28.660
And I don't want to see you mess up

04:28.680 --> 04:31.050
what you and John have because
you can't do something

04:31.080 --> 04:33.220
that most five-year-olds can do.

04:33.250 --> 04:35.920
I can do tons of things a
five-year-old can't do.

04:36.050 --> 04:37.420
Could a five-year-old do this?

04:39.760 --> 04:41.220
Probably.

04:43.220 --> 04:45.050
- All right.
- Come on.

04:57.040 --> 04:59.780
Okay. Okay, you've never even seen

04:59.800 --> 05:02.340
someone get on a bike, right?

05:02.400 --> 05:03.710
You get in from the side.

05:03.840 --> 05:05.920
Just like a canopy bed.

05:05.940 --> 05:09.430
Oh! Well, now you're
speaking my language.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.810
Okay, there you go.

05:12.840 --> 05:15.430
All right. Now, picture this.

05:15.560 --> 05:17.890
It's a long and winding road.

05:18.020 --> 05:19.840
John is in front of you.

05:19.860 --> 05:21.340
And he's-he's-he's sweating,

05:21.360 --> 05:24.230
and he's in those tight
bicycle shorts, isn't he?

05:24.360 --> 05:26.360
Uh, sure.

05:26.410 --> 05:27.740
Here I come, John!

05:27.760 --> 05:30.080
- Yeah.
- I'm riding a bike!

05:30.100 --> 05:31.530
I'm riding a bike.

05:37.250 --> 05:40.500
I should have told you,
it-it does that sometimes.

05:44.670 --> 05:46.780
Oh. Uh, Mr. Hank's not home,

05:46.800 --> 05:48.440
and he doesn't like anyone in the house

05:48.470 --> 05:50.570
while I'm ironing his delicates.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.960
His delicates? I don't think
you can call them "delicates"

05:53.980 --> 05:57.680
if you get them out of
a big bin at Costco.

05:57.810 --> 06:00.000
Geez, are you doing his whole wardrobe?

06:00.060 --> 06:01.730
Well, as Mr. Hank says,

06:01.770 --> 06:05.150
"A man without clothes is
just a baby with chest hair."

06:06.260 --> 06:07.360
Hank is so cool.

06:09.410 --> 06:12.820
Does "cool" mean something
different nowadays?

06:12.850 --> 06:16.580
You know, there is, uh, somebody
else around here who's cool.

06:18.960 --> 06:21.630
Pretty cool.

06:23.670 --> 06:26.380
A certain lady.

06:26.510 --> 06:28.400
Who?

06:28.440 --> 06:30.900
Me! I am cool.

06:30.920 --> 06:33.720
And I think not going to
prom is a big mistake.

06:33.810 --> 06:37.679
But... Hank told me that 80%
of suicides are prom-related.

06:37.680 --> 06:41.940
Oh, no. I-I think it's...
much lower than that.

06:42.020 --> 06:45.290
Are you telling me that
there is actually nobody

06:45.300 --> 06:46.860
that you would want to ask?

06:49.340 --> 06:51.950
Are you trying to get me
to say you again, or...?

06:52.070 --> 06:54.420
Oh, honey, I was the prom queen.

06:54.450 --> 06:56.880
Baby steps.

06:56.960 --> 06:59.470
Well, I'd ask this girl Shauna,

06:59.500 --> 07:01.880
but would a first-chair
tuba really go with me?

07:01.940 --> 07:03.440
I mean, the world is her oyster.

07:03.460 --> 07:05.140
Girl who plays the tuba sounds like

07:05.160 --> 07:07.520
a perfect last-minute prom invite.

07:07.540 --> 07:10.020
Are you sure? I mean, my coolest move...

07:10.080 --> 07:13.200
- is my robot voice.
- Yeah.

07:13.220 --> 07:15.770
Ooh. Maybe, uh, maybe go text her.

07:16.920 --> 07:17.960
What are you doing here?

07:18.180 --> 07:20.330
Ernie's asking a girl to the prom.

07:20.350 --> 07:21.890
The hell he is.

07:21.900 --> 07:24.480
I'm trying to help this
boy. Look at this nerd.

07:24.610 --> 07:27.070
He was born stuffed in a locker. Ow!

07:27.080 --> 07:28.380
He's sitting right there.

07:28.400 --> 07:31.610
It's okay, ma'am. I know what I am.

07:31.740 --> 07:36.140
You know, back when I was very,
very, very cool in high school,

07:36.160 --> 07:38.740
I used to mess with nerds
like Ernie all the time.

07:38.750 --> 07:42.580
At my prom, I pantsed a nerd
and I made him eat worms.

07:42.710 --> 07:44.500
You brought worms to the prom?

07:44.630 --> 07:46.260
No. I made another
nerd bring them to me.

07:46.280 --> 07:47.840
That's how cool I was.

07:47.960 --> 07:49.340
You see,

07:49.460 --> 07:51.670
now I'm making up for all that.

07:51.750 --> 07:53.700
I am using my present

07:53.720 --> 07:56.280
to fix my past... much like they did

07:56.300 --> 07:58.580
in Back to the Future and
Back to the Future II,

07:58.600 --> 08:00.519
and I assume Back to the Future III,

08:00.520 --> 08:01.600
but I didn't see that one.

08:01.730 --> 08:03.820
Shauna said yes.

08:03.840 --> 08:05.570
I texted her, and she said yes.

08:05.580 --> 08:07.420
Thanks to Miss Margaret. Oh.

08:07.440 --> 08:10.200
Good for you. I think
what you really needed

08:10.220 --> 08:12.740
was a good woman-tor.

08:12.750 --> 08:15.200
Isn't that what you said earlier, Hank?

08:15.320 --> 08:18.700
You say so much stupid crap,
it's hard to keep track.

08:19.980 --> 08:21.500
This is awesome.

08:21.560 --> 08:23.580
I'm going to boogie at prom.

08:24.900 --> 08:26.400
They gonna kill this boy, Margaret.

08:34.100 --> 08:35.799
Hey, Hank.

08:35.929 --> 08:37.039
Ernie wanted to say goodbye

08:37.059 --> 08:38.549
before he heads off to the dance.

08:38.570 --> 08:39.960
I got him this far, but he wants you

08:40.000 --> 08:41.429
to tie his bow tie for him.

08:41.559 --> 08:43.059
Well, okay,

08:43.100 --> 08:44.740
but only because you got him looking

08:44.770 --> 08:47.730
like he's about to fix
James Bond's laptop.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.820
Now, if it was me,

08:49.880 --> 08:51.400
I'd have put you in a purple suit

08:51.420 --> 08:52.900
with a couple two-finger rings.

08:53.030 --> 08:54.860
So you want him to look like a pimp?

08:54.920 --> 08:56.880
Margaret, women like pimps.

08:56.900 --> 08:58.410
That's how pimps become pimps.

08:59.460 --> 09:01.020
Now, stop distracting me.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.200
Hold up.

09:02.330 --> 09:05.000
There you go. All set.

09:05.620 --> 09:07.180
Okay.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.419
Well, we'll fix that before you go.

09:09.420 --> 09:11.210
Looks like a cat did it.

09:11.340 --> 09:13.520
He's gonna kill at the
dance, by the way.

09:13.540 --> 09:15.620
Show him the new dance
move I taught you, Ern.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.980
Okay. One sweet move coming right up.

09:20.010 --> 09:21.680
Mm-hmm.

09:21.810 --> 09:24.050
So, I guess Margaret's pretty adamant

09:24.070 --> 09:26.600
about you remaining a virgin, huh?

09:26.730 --> 09:28.540
Ernie, put a little more hip into it.

09:28.560 --> 09:30.860
Hips. Come on, find that hip, sweetie.

09:30.880 --> 09:32.370
- Come on.
- This? Right here?

09:32.400 --> 09:34.699
- Come on, you got it.
- No, Ernie, Ernie.

09:34.700 --> 09:35.710
- Ernie.
- Yeah?

09:35.720 --> 09:37.280
If you gonna go, hang back.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.910
Lean against the wall.

09:40.030 --> 09:41.780
Nod your head to the music.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.580
Occasionally, you point to your friend.

09:46.710 --> 09:48.410
Oh.

09:49.500 --> 09:51.900
Okay, so this?

09:53.720 --> 09:55.180
Yeah, that's it.

09:55.310 --> 09:56.850
Okay. All right.

09:56.880 --> 09:58.600
All right, you got it now.

09:58.730 --> 10:00.290
- Hey, Mom.
- Wait, what?

10:00.310 --> 10:01.520
Mom?

10:01.570 --> 10:03.060
I said friend.

10:03.120 --> 10:04.560
My mom is my best friend.

10:04.580 --> 10:06.320
Oh, damn it.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.920
Okay. We gonna have to
pull the plug on this one.

10:08.940 --> 10:10.300
He's gonna embarrass himself.

10:10.320 --> 10:11.920
Shauna is gonna laugh at you.

10:11.970 --> 10:14.000
Laugh at me? Is that
really gonna happen?

10:14.020 --> 10:15.850
No, she is not gonna laugh at you.

10:15.880 --> 10:18.660
You saved her from spending
prom night with her tuba.

10:18.700 --> 10:21.710
- Oh, she's bringing her tuba.
- Oh, damn it.

10:21.830 --> 10:24.660
You gonna have nerd blood
on your hands, Margaret.

10:24.760 --> 10:27.040
Nerd blood!

10:32.880 --> 10:36.640
Look. Did you fall off a
stationary bike? Sure.

10:36.660 --> 10:39.040
Is that virtually impossible
to do? Absolutely.

10:40.480 --> 10:43.190
But you can't give up. John's worth it.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.160
But I'm scared.

10:45.320 --> 10:48.050
I mean, cars whizzing around.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.400
What about birds?

10:49.530 --> 10:51.490
There are so many distractions.

10:51.500 --> 10:53.050
And with my A.D.D...

10:53.070 --> 10:55.900
Cookies. We're having cookies tonight.

10:55.960 --> 10:59.940
What kind of lunatic sends
a nerd to the prom?

11:00.000 --> 11:02.290
I mean, she is sending the
lamb to the slaughter.

11:02.360 --> 11:06.000
Oh, so you're just starting
your own conversation?

11:06.130 --> 11:07.840
I think Shauna's setting him up.

11:07.860 --> 11:09.440
This whole thing may be one big prank.

11:09.470 --> 11:12.399
Oh, Hank, why does your
mind go to these places?

11:12.400 --> 11:14.980
Because high schoolers
are the spawn of Satan

11:14.990 --> 11:18.960
and their actions are at the
direction of Beelzebub.

11:19.040 --> 11:21.280
Sid, I think you could learn from Ernie.

11:21.300 --> 11:24.620
That dorky bastard has a 90% chance

11:24.690 --> 11:27.610
of being hung from a
flagpole by his underwear,

11:27.650 --> 11:30.190
and he still went to prom.

11:30.320 --> 11:33.330
Unless he rode a bike to the prom,

11:33.350 --> 11:35.610
I fail to see the connection.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.499
You got the Hank.

11:42.500 --> 11:43.920
Yeah, Ernie.

11:43.970 --> 11:46.520
Oh, okay, w-well, calm down.

11:46.640 --> 11:47.880
Speak slowly.

11:47.900 --> 11:51.480
Damn it, please, not that robot voice.

11:51.520 --> 11:53.420
All right, sit tight. I'm coming to you.

11:54.780 --> 11:56.520
Ernie's too scared to go into the dance,

11:56.540 --> 11:57.940
so he's hiding out in the bathroom.

11:57.960 --> 12:00.280
I told you he wasn't ready for no prom.

12:00.300 --> 12:02.350
- See, this is all your fault.
- What, my fault?

12:02.360 --> 12:04.700
If he's scared, it's 'cause
of all the stuff you said.

12:04.720 --> 12:08.280
Your goodbye to him included
the phrase "nerd blood."

12:08.300 --> 12:10.090
- Come on.
- Why can't John and I

12:10.130 --> 12:13.130
just do normal boyfriend
stuff like have sex?

12:13.250 --> 12:15.750
I'm good at that. I've
never once fallen off.

12:21.890 --> 12:24.150
I'm gonna grab our boy, and
we gonna head on out of here.

12:24.170 --> 12:26.850
Wow! Look at this place.
Like my old school.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.350
The trophy cases.

12:28.480 --> 12:30.480
The mascot on the floor.

12:30.520 --> 12:32.580
Our team was the Gators.

12:32.610 --> 12:34.520
We're boom, dynamite.

12:34.560 --> 12:36.320
We're boom, dynamite.

12:36.440 --> 12:38.859
We're
tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick.

12:38.860 --> 12:40.190
Boom, dynamite.

12:40.320 --> 12:42.410
Snap. Crunch.

12:42.530 --> 12:45.450
Go, Gators.

12:47.660 --> 12:49.540
I didn't follow that at all.

12:50.660 --> 12:52.500
So the gator ate the dynamite?

12:54.000 --> 12:55.880
Well, let me guess.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.760
- You were on the cheer squad.
- You're damn straight.

12:58.780 --> 13:00.890
I used to haze those
freshmen cheerleaders.

13:00.920 --> 13:02.980
They called me "The Enforcer."

13:03.000 --> 13:05.900
I mean, nothing too
crazy. Just the usual.

13:05.920 --> 13:08.060
Hit 'em with a sack of boots.

13:08.100 --> 13:10.960
You hit people with
boots? That's horrible.

13:10.980 --> 13:13.240
That kind of thing can
scar people for life.

13:13.260 --> 13:16.380
Me? You were worse than
me. You fed a kid worms.

13:16.400 --> 13:18.150
No, I didn't.

13:18.280 --> 13:21.070
Y-yeah, I did, I mean.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.940
Well, did you or didn't you?

13:22.980 --> 13:25.450
Uh, I...

13:25.580 --> 13:27.840
Can I see that cheer again?

13:27.880 --> 13:31.759
Did you feed worms to
a kid or did you not?

13:31.760 --> 13:33.160
Because this seems like something

13:33.180 --> 13:34.460
that you would remember.

13:34.500 --> 13:36.800
Of course I remember.

13:36.820 --> 13:39.880
'Cause I was fed those worms.

13:39.890 --> 13:42.970
I was tortured every day in high school.

13:43.100 --> 13:45.690
Haven't you ever wondered
why I don't fish?

13:48.310 --> 13:50.420
No.

13:50.440 --> 13:54.740
I know exactly what
Ernie is going through.

13:54.770 --> 13:59.560
So if you'll excuse me, Your
Highness, the prom queen,

13:59.620 --> 14:01.720
I'm gonna grab our boy
and we going home.

14:01.740 --> 14:04.910
Oh, Hank, I am really sorry
that happened to you,

14:04.960 --> 14:08.320
and about you not being able to fish.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.200
But this isn't about
you. It's about Ernie.

14:13.220 --> 14:15.720
It could go great, or it
could go really, really bad,

14:15.740 --> 14:18.430
but you got to let Ernie
find that out for himself.

14:18.550 --> 14:20.620
No, you wouldn't understand.

14:20.640 --> 14:22.779
'Cause you were cool.

14:22.780 --> 14:27.140
So, if you'll excuse me,
there is a teenage boy

14:27.170 --> 14:30.060
that needs me in the bathroom.

14:35.700 --> 14:38.200
Okay, Sid. I solved
your outside problem.

14:38.300 --> 14:39.920
No cars. No birds.

14:39.980 --> 14:43.330
Just you, the bike and the open hallway.

14:43.450 --> 14:45.180
- I'm gonna do it.
- All right.

14:45.200 --> 14:47.080
- On the count of three.
- Okay.

14:47.210 --> 14:50.239
One... two...

14:50.240 --> 14:51.880
I can't do it.

14:52.900 --> 14:55.210
John needs to find a new boyfriend.

14:55.340 --> 14:59.020
I might as well just get out of
this thing before he dumps me.

14:59.040 --> 15:01.380
Plus, this helmet is hurting my ears.

15:03.640 --> 15:05.160
All right, you're right.

15:05.220 --> 15:07.980
Yeah, he needs someone less pathetic.

15:08.100 --> 15:13.360
It is unnatural for humans
to be on two wheels.

15:13.400 --> 15:14.639
- Four, I get.
- Mm-hmm.

15:14.640 --> 15:15.920
- Three, I get.
- Mm-hmm.

15:15.930 --> 15:18.700
One is weird but cute
when animals do it.

15:18.950 --> 15:21.820
But two I do not get.

15:22.040 --> 15:24.820
Well, you know who does get two?

15:24.830 --> 15:28.250
John's next boyfriend...

15:28.260 --> 15:29.620
Pierre.

15:29.650 --> 15:32.740
He's a French expat
living in the Bahamas.

15:32.820 --> 15:35.240
And you know what the
French love, don't you?

15:35.300 --> 15:37.840
Turtlenecks.

15:37.950 --> 15:41.120
Well, yes, but...

15:41.150 --> 15:42.610
also bikes.

15:42.740 --> 15:45.950
I can see it now, riding
off into the sunset,

15:45.960 --> 15:49.240
John and Pierre, in their
matching turtlenecks.

15:49.260 --> 15:52.900
Oh, hell no. John is my boyfriend.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.410
Screw you, Pierre.

15:55.540 --> 15:57.000
John, here I come.

15:57.020 --> 16:00.170
Oh. Oh. Oh, my God. I'm riding a bike.

16:00.180 --> 16:01.920
You tricked me, Charlie. Thank you.

16:01.950 --> 16:03.040
No, that's all you, Sid.

16:03.060 --> 16:04.880
Now stop before you hit that table.

16:04.900 --> 16:06.840
Uh, I don't know how to stop.

16:06.940 --> 16:10.140
Scared. Your boy's real scared.

16:14.480 --> 16:17.700
Ouch. I should have left that helmet on.

16:17.980 --> 16:20.000
I see that now.

16:20.640 --> 16:23.440
Does anybody work here?

16:33.040 --> 16:34.499
Ernie, you in here?

16:34.500 --> 16:36.660
- Yeah.
- Listen.

16:37.540 --> 16:39.360
I got to tell you something

16:39.380 --> 16:42.130
that's gonna rock you to your core.

16:43.200 --> 16:46.170
The coolest person you know...

16:47.510 --> 16:49.340
...was a nerd.

16:50.810 --> 16:52.840
My mom?

16:55.140 --> 16:58.900
Do not hit the boy.

17:00.940 --> 17:04.069
I'm wearing my fake butt
underwear, and still nothing.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.099
If he doesn't ask me to dance soon,

17:06.119 --> 17:07.819
I'm just gonna ask him.

17:07.839 --> 17:11.160
Hey, gals. I couldn't
help but overhearing.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.240
Butt looks terrif', by the way.

17:15.079 --> 17:19.119
I was my high school's prom queen.

17:19.250 --> 17:20.920
So...

17:22.160 --> 17:24.339
So...?

17:24.380 --> 17:27.700
So, if you need any advice on anything,

17:27.720 --> 17:29.720
you know, prom-related,

17:29.740 --> 17:32.970
Maggie Mag's here to help.

17:33.810 --> 17:35.380
Thanks.

17:35.400 --> 17:38.500
But we don't need any advice
from some lame grandma.

17:38.810 --> 17:42.520
Lame? I smoked pot.

17:42.580 --> 17:45.400
And I had lots and lots of sex.

17:45.530 --> 17:48.040
And back then, we didn't
even use any protection.

17:48.060 --> 17:51.910
We just lit a cigarette
and said a prayer.

17:52.030 --> 17:54.120
Smoking's gross.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.200
And we practice abstinence.

17:56.290 --> 17:57.940
Abstinence?

17:58.020 --> 18:01.120
Good luck getting that
guy to dance with you.

18:03.380 --> 18:07.000
So, after I washed the taste
of worms out of my mouth,

18:07.070 --> 18:08.940
I went back on the dance floor,

18:09.010 --> 18:10.640
and I saw the same dude

18:10.680 --> 18:13.380
that fed me the worms
dancing with my date.

18:13.460 --> 18:16.930
I spent the rest of the night
crying under the bleachers.

18:17.060 --> 18:19.980
For the next two years, every
time I walked down the hallway,

18:20.000 --> 18:23.310
all I heard was, "Crybaby ass!"

18:24.360 --> 18:26.620
"You need a hankie, Hankie?"

18:27.560 --> 18:31.190
"Hey, Hankie, Hankie,
with your crybaby ass."

18:32.530 --> 18:35.140
Well, you get the point.

18:39.940 --> 18:42.000
I cry sometimes, too.

18:44.500 --> 18:47.000
Whoa, whoa, hey, whoa, whoa, Ernie.

18:47.280 --> 18:49.840
Ernie, we in the bathroom.

18:49.970 --> 18:52.470
Yeah. Let-let's get out of here.

18:52.590 --> 18:55.180
Prom's not a place for nerds like us.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.220
Yeah, but you didn't let
me finish my story.

18:57.350 --> 18:59.180
I told you what I did,

18:59.200 --> 19:01.430
but I didn't tell you
what I should have done.

19:01.560 --> 19:03.960
I should have gone back
out on that dance floor

19:03.980 --> 19:05.900
and danced my butt off.

19:06.020 --> 19:07.560
You can still do that.

19:07.690 --> 19:09.060
You think so?

19:09.070 --> 19:10.570
I know so.

19:10.690 --> 19:12.619
Just 'cause bad stuff happened to me

19:12.620 --> 19:14.030
doesn't mean it's gonna happen to you.

19:14.110 --> 19:16.780
Go on out there and find Shauna.

19:17.030 --> 19:18.990
Yeah, uh, okay.

19:19.120 --> 19:20.660
How do I look?

19:20.790 --> 19:22.700
Like a little pimp.

19:22.830 --> 19:24.340
You feel good?

19:24.370 --> 19:28.290
Affirmative, Mr. Hank.

19:28.420 --> 19:31.520
Go out there and make some memories.

19:35.540 --> 19:37.090
Whew.

19:44.650 --> 19:46.500
It's Ernie's turn.

19:48.860 --> 19:51.820
Oh, a kiss on the cheek.

19:51.840 --> 19:55.360
That's like third base for
a nerd, but you know that.

19:55.490 --> 19:57.820
I can't believe it, but I did it.

19:57.950 --> 20:01.330
I'm a pretty good mentor
after all, aren't I?

20:01.450 --> 20:02.899
No, not really.

20:02.900 --> 20:06.480
So, uh, would you like to get a photo

20:06.500 --> 20:07.920
with the prom queen?

20:08.040 --> 20:11.250
I don't know, she looks kind of mean.

20:11.380 --> 20:13.670
I'm talking about me.

20:15.430 --> 20:18.300
Hey, yo, toots, can I
borrow this for a sec?

20:33.240 --> 20:36.280
You know what, Hank? I feel
like I really know now

20:36.300 --> 20:38.520
what it feels like to be a nerd.

20:38.560 --> 20:40.020
When you were in the
bathroom with Ernie,

20:40.040 --> 20:41.640
I ran into these three mean girls,

20:41.660 --> 20:43.800
and they called me "lame."

20:43.830 --> 20:46.870
So I feel your pain.

20:50.090 --> 20:53.439
I ate worms, Margaret.

20:53.440 --> 20:55.540
So, you gotten any update?

20:55.560 --> 20:57.260
What happened with Ernie and Shauna?

20:57.320 --> 21:01.420
Ernie and Shauna had a great
time at the prom last night.

21:01.440 --> 21:04.419
So great that tonight, Ernie and Shauna

21:04.420 --> 21:07.520
and Ernie's mom are going out again.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.940
Good news here... I learned
how to ride a bike.

21:09.960 --> 21:12.250
I also learned that when
you crack your coccyx,

21:12.280 --> 21:15.580
your three best friends don't
even send you flowers.

21:15.600 --> 21:18.239
I'm serious, you can just
get 'em off the fireplace,

21:18.240 --> 21:20.200
bring me something.

21:22.420 --> 21:24.030
And I learned...

21:24.160 --> 21:27.660
Hell, we don't all have to
learn something, do we?

21:27.700 --> 21:29.760
I'm frickin' 70.
