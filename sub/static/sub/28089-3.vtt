00:20.091 --> 00:21.826
[Vic] <i>Previously on
Doom Patrol...</i>

00:21.859 --> 00:23.161
[Von Fuchs] <i>Mr. Morden.</i>

00:23.193 --> 00:26.597
Yes. Yes, you must be
Sturmbanhfuhrer Von Fuchs.

00:26.632 --> 00:31.568
You've slipped through
my fingers for the last time.

00:31.602 --> 00:33.572
It's the Chief!

00:33.604 --> 00:35.906
[Rita] <i>Look, it's all going
to be fine.</i>

00:35.939 --> 00:37.174
Chief disappears all the time.

00:37.207 --> 00:38.676
[Cliff]
Into a fucking hole?

00:38.710 --> 00:41.679
This is what the world looks like
when we try to live in it.

00:41.679 --> 00:42.646
Where are you going?

00:42.646 --> 00:44.149
We're not heroes.

00:44.182 --> 00:45.182
[Cliff] So that's it?

00:45.216 --> 00:46.216
I'm going this alone.

00:46.250 --> 00:47.884
Did you see anything useful?

00:47.918 --> 00:49.719
[Cliff] Yes, damn it!
The donkey!

00:49.719 --> 00:51.121
What's the donkey
got to do with it?

00:51.121 --> 00:53.124
[Cliff] That's what I'm
trying to figure out, asshole!

00:53.124 --> 00:54.491
The donkey is a door?

00:54.524 --> 00:55.558
We're going in!

00:55.593 --> 00:56.695
[both yelling]

00:56.728 --> 01:00.198
The worst thing
about not knowing your own past...

01:00.231 --> 01:03.368
-[screaming]
-...is that you're doomed
to repeat it.

01:03.368 --> 01:04.602
[Cliff]
Any sign of the Chief?

01:04.602 --> 01:05.603
We know he's alive.

01:05.603 --> 01:07.471
I'm staying here
until I find Niles Caulder.

01:07.504 --> 01:10.204
Like hell you are.

02:22.312 --> 02:26.062
[punk rock music playing]

03:04.655 --> 03:06.056
[man] Just go away!

03:06.090 --> 03:08.859
[mob clamoring]

03:08.893 --> 03:10.294
[man] We don't want you here!

03:10.328 --> 03:12.462
We don't care
about the Chief!

03:12.496 --> 03:14.299
[mob shouting]

03:14.331 --> 03:16.167
[man 2]
You fucked up our town!

03:16.200 --> 03:19.437
[indistinct shouting]

03:19.471 --> 03:22.173
-[man 1] Get out of here.
-[man 2] Goddamn bitch.

03:22.206 --> 03:25.075
-[stapler clicks]
-[man 2 grunts]

03:25.109 --> 03:26.978
[laughing]

03:27.010 --> 03:29.561
[laughing echoes]

03:36.287 --> 03:37.756
[Vic's mother]
<i>Just three weeks, Victor.</i>

03:37.788 --> 03:40.258
[Vic] <i>Making me sit out
hurts the whole team.</i>

03:40.290 --> 03:42.159
They shouldn't have to suffer
for my mistake.

03:42.193 --> 03:45.128
-Your father and I
already discussed it.
-What?

03:45.163 --> 03:47.832
Why do you think
you only got three weeks?

03:47.866 --> 03:50.401
Your father wanted you to sit out
for the rest of the season.

03:50.401 --> 03:52.337
So you should be kissing
my behind right about now.

03:52.337 --> 03:55.439
You're the one who told me
I should be spending more
time with my friends.

03:55.473 --> 03:59.443
Not at the expense
of your grades.

03:59.477 --> 04:02.681
Look, I know this seems
like the end of the world.

04:02.713 --> 04:05.116
But in ten years from now
you won't even remember
this happened.

04:05.149 --> 04:08.752
This is bullshit!

04:08.786 --> 04:11.485
[breathes heavily]

04:17.862 --> 04:22.033
Grid, show me security footage
of Mom's lab five years ago,

04:22.065 --> 04:25.065
June 13th, 6:37 p.m.

04:29.874 --> 04:33.911
[gasps softly]

04:33.944 --> 04:37.995
Grid, authenticate footage.

04:39.651 --> 04:44.651
It hasn't been tampered with
or edited?

04:45.521 --> 04:47.757
Cute.

04:47.791 --> 04:50.492
What have you got?

04:59.805 --> 05:03.007
[Cliff] I think Chief
might be a hoarder.

05:03.040 --> 05:04.576
And a diabetic.

05:04.608 --> 05:07.146
I've been trying to get
Chief to organize this
dungeon for years.

05:07.146 --> 05:11.182
How are we supposed to find
anything about this
Nobody person in here?

05:11.214 --> 05:15.319
Or where he may have
taken the Chief.

05:15.353 --> 05:20.353
There's no rhyme or reason
to any of it.

05:24.829 --> 05:26.230
Oh, my God.

05:26.264 --> 05:27.432
[Cliff] What?

05:27.464 --> 05:30.165
I found something.

05:34.338 --> 05:38.838
Oh, look,
that fucking donkey!

05:45.749 --> 05:47.249
What's up?

05:53.458 --> 05:55.526
We need to gather everyone
for a briefing.

05:55.560 --> 05:59.230
-A what?
-A briefing.

05:59.262 --> 06:01.598
It's a meeting
where intel is disseminated.

06:01.632 --> 06:04.735
Right. Sure.

06:04.767 --> 06:05.903
"Disseminated."

06:05.935 --> 06:10.240
Just go get everyone.

06:10.274 --> 06:11.624
[gasping]

06:21.987 --> 06:26.987
This is your response
because I wanted
some ground rules?

06:31.161 --> 06:33.129
[Larry] Did you
pressure-check the APUs?

06:33.163 --> 06:38.035
[John] I did.

06:38.069 --> 06:40.870
What about the dive brakes?

06:40.904 --> 06:43.507
Oh, my God.

06:43.540 --> 06:47.144
I'd forgotten. [chuckles]

06:47.177 --> 06:49.146
Relax.

06:49.180 --> 06:50.447
This time tomorrow night

06:50.447 --> 06:53.184
-you'll be the fastest
pilot on Earth.
-Hmm.

06:53.216 --> 06:56.821
But right now,
you're mine.

06:56.853 --> 06:58.122
[Larry sighs]

06:58.156 --> 07:02.661
-John.
-Hey. Hey.

07:02.694 --> 07:05.295
This is the one hour a week
I get with you.

07:05.329 --> 07:08.666
There's just a lot
riding on tomorrow.

07:08.699 --> 07:13.471
If all goes well,
I'm on the next
Mercury mission.

07:13.504 --> 07:15.639
That's right.

07:15.673 --> 07:19.742
You become a poster child
for a country who hates you.

07:19.776 --> 07:21.545
Nobody hates me.

07:21.545 --> 07:22.913
No.

07:22.947 --> 07:26.951
Not all-American airman
Larry Trainor, no,
everybody loves him.

07:26.983 --> 07:29.153
Am I missing something?

07:29.187 --> 07:31.555
I mean, you know that
I've had my eye on Mercury.

07:31.588 --> 07:36.194
All of a sudden
it's a problem for you?

07:36.226 --> 07:38.026
[John sighs]

07:44.267 --> 07:48.872
I put in
for a discharge, Larry.

07:48.906 --> 07:50.774
What?

07:50.807 --> 07:51.942
[scoffs]

07:51.976 --> 07:55.314
I'm done tip-toeing around
these narrow-minded meatheads

07:55.314 --> 08:00.346
who'd sooner kick my ass
than look at me if they knew
who I really was.

08:00.617 --> 08:04.668
-I'm out.
-Are you serious?

08:07.190 --> 08:09.560
Come with me.

08:09.593 --> 08:11.062
-Oh, my God.
-[chuckles]

08:11.096 --> 08:14.065
Make your flight tomorrow,
then we'll leave.

08:14.098 --> 08:16.000
We'd make a killing
in the private sector.

08:16.033 --> 08:18.134
You're a selfish prick.

08:18.168 --> 08:19.470
I'm selfish?

08:19.504 --> 08:21.740
You couldn't wait 12 lousy
hours to unburden yourself?

08:21.773 --> 08:23.341
You had to drop all this
on me tonight?

08:23.375 --> 08:26.110
Oh, right. How dare I have
feelings that interfere
with your needs?

08:26.144 --> 08:28.278
Well, the next time
you wanna talk to me
about me,

08:28.300 --> 08:29.447
have the balls
to come out and say it.

08:29.447 --> 08:31.982
I'm not the fucking
coward here, Larry.

08:32.015 --> 08:33.784
Go to hell, John.

08:33.817 --> 08:37.422
Don't you get it?
I have no say in
our relationship, Larry.

08:37.455 --> 08:39.389
It's always about you.

08:39.423 --> 08:40.958
Your career, your family.

08:40.991 --> 08:45.895
Right, because I'm the one
who actually has
something to lose.

08:45.929 --> 08:47.798
Fuck you.

08:47.831 --> 08:49.267
Hey, John.

08:49.299 --> 08:51.134
John, hey, hey, come on.

08:51.168 --> 08:53.003
I'm sorry, all right?

08:53.037 --> 08:56.039
Look, we'll work this out.

08:56.072 --> 08:57.908
I promise you, just...

08:57.908 --> 08:59.711
Can you give me a minute
to think about this?

08:59.744 --> 09:02.145
At least until after tomorrow.

09:02.178 --> 09:05.783
It's our big day.

09:05.816 --> 09:09.453
Fine.

09:09.486 --> 09:12.490
I'm going.

09:12.523 --> 09:16.423
No matter what you decide.

09:26.102 --> 09:30.307
Morning, dipshit.

09:30.341 --> 09:31.442
[Vic]
<i>Here's what we know.</i>

09:31.475 --> 09:33.610
<i>Mr. Nobody's real name
is Eric Morden.</i>

09:33.610 --> 09:35.346
He was a member of
the Brotherhood of Evil,

09:35.379 --> 09:36.880
supervillain team
from the 1930s.

09:36.914 --> 09:38.682
What exactly are
we doing here?

09:38.716 --> 09:39.716
It's, uh, a briefing.

09:39.716 --> 09:41.586
-A what?
-I'm not doing this again.

09:41.619 --> 09:44.355
Are we really the best people
to hunt a super villain?

09:44.389 --> 09:48.958
Morden disappeared while
traveling through
South America in the 1940s.

09:48.993 --> 09:50.528
This photo

09:50.561 --> 09:53.831
places our donkey friend
in Paraguay in 1948.

09:53.831 --> 09:55.200
Something happened down there.

09:55.200 --> 09:57.534
Something important enough
that the Chief kept this photo.

09:57.568 --> 09:59.703
Do you have a photo printer
in there somewhere?

09:59.738 --> 10:01.907
-No.
-Then where did the photos
come out from?

10:01.940 --> 10:04.808
-I said no.
-Is it your butt?
I bet it's his butt.

10:04.842 --> 10:06.745
All right, say we go
to Paraguay, then what?

10:06.778 --> 10:08.746
Where do you get toner
for your butt printer?

10:08.746 --> 10:12.183
-Who died and made you
team leader?
-Everyone, just shut up.

10:12.216 --> 10:16.386
Chief saved all your lives.
You owe it to him
to keep looking.

10:16.421 --> 10:18.121
Are you the best people
for the job?

10:18.154 --> 10:19.724
Hell, no.

10:19.758 --> 10:20.926
But we're all he's got.

10:20.958 --> 10:22.927
Someone else wanna take charge,
be my guest.

10:22.961 --> 10:27.197
Your first job,
get us to Paraguay.
Any ideas?

10:27.230 --> 10:28.666
No?

10:28.700 --> 10:31.969
How does a private jet sound?

10:32.001 --> 10:33.671
[line ringing]

10:33.705 --> 10:35.139
[Silas] <i>Everything all right?</i>

10:35.172 --> 10:36.240
All good.

10:36.274 --> 10:38.543
I need the jet gassed
and ready to fly in an hour.

10:38.576 --> 10:39.945
<i>Are you ready to come home?</i>

10:39.977 --> 10:42.648
[scoffs]
Not until I find Niles,
I told you.

10:42.681 --> 10:45.682
<i>Well, I think it's very brave
of you to try to strike out
on your own like this.</i>

10:45.716 --> 10:47.684
I should get going,
lots to do before take off.

10:47.719 --> 10:49.586
<i>But being your own man</i>

10:49.620 --> 10:50.922
<i>means making your own way.</i>

10:50.956 --> 10:52.823
You don't want to
give me the jet.

10:52.856 --> 10:54.558
Fine, I'll charter one.

10:54.591 --> 10:56.159
<i>I'm not making myself clear.</i>

10:56.192 --> 10:57.629
<i>This mission you're on</i>

10:57.662 --> 10:59.831
<i>is your mission,
not S.T.A.R. Labs'.</i>

10:59.831 --> 11:01.566
<i>You're gonna have to
gather your own resources</i>

11:01.566 --> 11:03.668
<i>and that means
no S.T.A.R. credit cards</i>

11:03.668 --> 11:05.302
<i>or corporate
account privileges.</i>

11:05.336 --> 11:06.837
I'm asking you
for help here.

11:06.870 --> 11:09.740
-Can't you just help me?
<i>-You're a smart man, Vic.</i>

11:09.774 --> 11:13.344
<i>I'm sure you'll figure
something out.</i>

11:13.376 --> 11:14.427
[sighs]

11:19.015 --> 11:23.386
[Rita sighs]

11:23.421 --> 11:27.770
[vehicle approaches, honking]

11:38.568 --> 11:43.407
Please, tell me, this is
our ride to the airport.

11:43.441 --> 11:46.543
Change of plan, hop on.

11:46.576 --> 11:48.645
You seriously want us
to drive to Paraguay?

11:48.679 --> 11:51.015
-[Larry] Which takes a week.
-[Vic] No,

11:51.048 --> 11:53.216
it does not take a week.
[scoffs]

11:53.250 --> 11:54.619
[Rita] Okay.

11:54.652 --> 11:56.601
It takes two.

12:00.491 --> 12:02.726
-It's this left, here.
-Larry, I know where I'm going.

12:02.759 --> 12:05.196
[Larry] Where's the map?
Where's the map?

12:05.229 --> 12:06.563
[Jane] <i>Rita, the map!</i>

12:06.596 --> 12:08.166
[Vic] <i>Guys,
I know where I'm going.</i>

12:08.200 --> 12:11.769
[Cliff] You know what
wins championships?
Extra absorbent diapers.

12:11.802 --> 12:13.770
Hey, grandma,
grandma's in town,

12:13.804 --> 12:16.140
[clears throat]
I am obeying the law.

12:16.140 --> 12:17.642
Could you drive
just a little faster?

12:17.674 --> 12:22.674
Just a little bit faster.
Come on.

12:25.950 --> 12:28.986
You just turn right
over there...

12:28.986 --> 12:30.488
-[exclaims] What are you doing?
-[cars honking]

12:30.488 --> 12:33.158
[all yelling indistinctly]

12:33.191 --> 12:35.326
-[horn honking]
-[Larry] Pedal on the right.

12:35.359 --> 12:36.827
I'm gonna kill myself!

12:36.860 --> 12:38.763
[Cliff laughs] Don't do it.

12:38.763 --> 12:39.998
-[Larry] Jane, Jane!
-[Vic] Hey!

12:39.998 --> 12:42.649
[Cliff] She's doing it!
Oh, shit!

12:56.581 --> 12:59.350
[Larry] Hey,
can you hear me?

12:59.384 --> 13:01.619
That stunt you pulled
in the Chief's lab,

13:01.652 --> 13:03.087
completely uncalled-for.

13:03.120 --> 13:06.524
Now, I admit my note
may have been terse.

13:06.557 --> 13:10.227
But endangering my life?
I'm well within my rights
to set boundaries.

13:10.261 --> 13:13.563
It's my body,
I call the shots, not you.

13:13.597 --> 13:16.433
You're just
a goddamn hitchhiker.

13:16.466 --> 13:18.168
You're a soul-sucking parasite.

13:18.201 --> 13:21.572
[grunts]

13:21.605 --> 13:26.009
[tires screeching]

13:26.043 --> 13:28.312
[grunts]

13:28.346 --> 13:32.783
[Jane] Whoa, whoa!

13:32.784 --> 13:34.018
What the hell's
wrong with you?

13:34.019 --> 13:35.285
[Cliff] What the fuck happened?

13:35.318 --> 13:37.221
All good.

13:37.221 --> 13:38.822
We're all good.

13:38.856 --> 13:40.057
[Vic] What did you do, Larry?

13:40.091 --> 13:42.659
I didn't do anything,
it was him.

13:42.693 --> 13:45.129
-It.
-Well, could you tell him
to undo it?

13:45.163 --> 13:48.265
Look, we're not exactly
on speaking terms
at the moment.

13:48.299 --> 13:50.369
Point of fact, I think he may
be trying to kill me.

13:50.402 --> 13:52.736
That would've been
useful information to have

13:52.769 --> 13:54.139
before we let you drive.

13:54.172 --> 13:57.673
Don't yell at him,
it's not his fault
he has no control

13:57.674 --> 14:01.778
-over that thing.
-Yes, I do.

14:01.812 --> 14:03.748
I will, uh...

14:03.780 --> 14:07.885
I'll get it under control.

14:07.918 --> 14:11.188
Impressive leadership skills
there, Batman,

14:52.263 --> 14:54.465
Hey...

14:54.498 --> 14:58.548
You didn't have
to wait up.

15:00.904 --> 15:03.340
Everything will be fine
tomorrow.

15:03.374 --> 15:06.878
I promise.

15:06.910 --> 15:09.813
What about
the day after that?

15:09.846 --> 15:13.217
It will also be fine.

15:13.250 --> 15:17.788
It's always a promise,
isn't it?

15:17.822 --> 15:20.958
It's late.

15:20.991 --> 15:24.427
And you got a big day
tomorrow, I am well aware.

15:24.461 --> 15:25.663
I'm going to bed.

15:25.696 --> 15:27.030
You comin'?

15:27.065 --> 15:30.835
You promised things
would change after
we moved here.

15:30.868 --> 15:33.171
You said there'd be no more...

15:33.203 --> 15:37.307
late night beers
with the guys.

15:37.341 --> 15:39.144
And I meant it.

15:39.177 --> 15:41.111
All right?
Just let me get
through tomorrow--

15:41.145 --> 15:43.780
You said the same thing
when we moved to Ellsworth.

15:43.815 --> 15:45.682
And Charleston.

15:45.716 --> 15:49.352
Why should here be
any different?

15:49.385 --> 15:53.557
Because I'm telling you.

15:53.591 --> 15:57.160
Maybe this is all my fault.

15:57.193 --> 15:59.730
No.

15:59.764 --> 16:04.563
You haven't done
anything wrong.

16:08.806 --> 16:13.755
I keep waiting
for you to change.

16:17.682 --> 16:22.682
Maybe I'm the one
who needs to make some changes.

16:25.856 --> 16:28.759
I'm really scared, Sheryl.

16:28.793 --> 16:32.562
I know it's not
a very tough thing to say,
but it's how I feel.

16:32.596 --> 16:34.164
I could die tomorrow

16:34.198 --> 16:35.634
and the only thing keeping me

16:35.667 --> 16:40.667
from losing my mind
is thinking about you
and the kids.

16:41.806 --> 16:44.442
Hey.

16:44.475 --> 16:48.245
Come here.

16:48.279 --> 16:52.884
I can't do this without you.

There's something
I've been wanting
to ask you about.

17:20.778 --> 17:25.415
I'm curious how you managed
to keep all of your...

17:25.449 --> 17:27.852
people in line.

17:27.884 --> 17:29.653
They're not "my" people,

17:29.686 --> 17:31.388
I don't control them.

17:31.423 --> 17:35.226
I respect them
and their right to exist.

17:35.259 --> 17:38.096
Maybe if you weren't
such an OCD,
alpha douche-waffle,

17:38.128 --> 17:43.128
the negative spirit
wouldn't treat you like one.

18:53.505 --> 18:54.971
Right here.
Now they're gone.

18:55.006 --> 18:56.907
That's real irresponsible, Vic.

18:56.941 --> 18:59.411

Before you embark upon

permit me to regale you
with my own story.

24:13.423 --> 24:16.094
It begins with a boy
in Bavaria

24:16.127 --> 24:21.065
who dreamt of expanding
the capabilities of
the human body.

24:21.097 --> 24:22.500
As a young doctor,

24:22.534 --> 24:26.203

-A psychopath.
-They didn't.

-And suddenly, my ideas
didn't seem so funny anymore.

but okay.

Oh, good, keeping up
your strength.

25:04.375 --> 25:07.310
You'll need it for when
you continue to do
absolutely nothing.

to make one grumpy.

25:12.383 --> 25:14.519
Do you even care about
finding the Chief?

25:14.551 --> 25:15.854
Of course I do.

25:15.886 --> 25:18.288
Then act like it. Get up
off your ass and do something.

25:18.321 --> 25:19.691
Like what?

25:19.723 --> 25:22.126
What is it that I can do
that will change our situation?

25:22.160 --> 25:24.596
Face it, Victor,
Paraguay is not happening
for us.

25:24.628 --> 25:28.633
All we can do is wait here
for the others to come back.

25:28.665 --> 25:31.102
I was wrong about you.

25:31.134 --> 25:33.336
You're not a star.

25:33.371 --> 25:34.838
You're a chickenshit.

25:34.873 --> 25:36.907
You've been dragging
your feet ever since we left.

25:36.942 --> 25:41.479
Why didn't you just
stay in Ohio?

25:41.511 --> 25:44.249
[sighs] You're right.

25:44.282 --> 25:47.417
I am afraid to look
for Niles. At least
I can admit it.

25:47.451 --> 25:50.255
-I'm not afraid.
-You're a hero.

25:50.288 --> 25:53.190
You could've done
this whole caper on your own,
but you need us

25:53.223 --> 25:54.758
to come along for what?

Face it, Victor.
You're as afraid
as the rest of us.

26:05.936 --> 26:09.140
After the war, I relocated
to Paraguay,

26:09.140 --> 26:10.141
for health reasons.

26:10.142 --> 26:12.777
There I continued
my groundbreaking research

26:12.810 --> 26:17.749
into imbuing the human body
with metaphysical abilities.

26:17.781 --> 26:22.487
You've no doubt heard
of my most infamous client...

26:22.519 --> 26:24.319
Eric Morden.

26:28.727 --> 26:33.064
Whose procedure in
my finest invention was
going exactly to specification

26:33.097 --> 26:38.097
until fate brought
a scoundrel to my door.

26:40.371 --> 26:41.872
-Is that the Chief?
-That's the Chief.

26:41.905 --> 26:43.641
[shushing]

26:43.674 --> 26:46.525
[indistinct voices]

26:54.720 --> 26:58.923
[puppet] The despicable fiend
escaped with something
of great value to me.

26:58.957 --> 27:01.960
But he failed to thwart
my anatomical revolution,

27:01.992 --> 27:06.992
my greatest achievement,
my Mr. Nobody.

27:08.164 --> 27:12.065
[triumphant music playing]

27:14.571 --> 27:16.208
So beautiful.

27:16.240 --> 27:20.711
Today, my descendants
continue my legacy of making
great men greater,

27:20.744 --> 27:23.346
here at Fuchtopia.

27:23.381 --> 27:25.682
We have a power
to suit every need.

27:25.717 --> 27:28.419
You can start small
with flight or super strength,

27:28.452 --> 27:29.854
or select
our top tier options,

27:29.887 --> 27:32.490
the Morden, which draws
metahuman powers

27:32.522 --> 27:33.758
from other dimensions.

27:33.791 --> 27:36.728
Consultants are standing by
to assist you.

27:36.760 --> 27:41.030
Sadly, we no longer
accept Groupons.

27:41.065 --> 27:42.714
[whistling]

27:46.904 --> 27:48.204
[Cliff] I don't know
about you guys,

27:48.205 --> 27:50.875
but I don't need upgrades
from a Nazi fuckhead,

27:50.909 --> 27:52.644
so let's just
shag ass out of here.

27:52.678 --> 27:57.678
Not yet. We know the Chief
was here when Mr. Nobody
Mr. Nobodied.

27:57.714 --> 27:58.983
We need to find out why.

27:59.017 --> 28:02.353
All three of you
will be opting
for the upgrades?

28:02.385 --> 28:05.490
-That's exciting.
-Uh, yeah.

28:05.522 --> 28:07.659
-Can't wait.
-[Larry] The Morden procedure,

28:07.692 --> 28:09.794
what does it do exactly?

28:09.827 --> 28:12.998
It embodies Von Fuchs'
deepest wish,

28:13.030 --> 28:16.000
to make any man a better man.

28:16.034 --> 28:20.704
This inter-dimensional chamber,
it can do that?

28:20.738 --> 28:22.205
-[machine buzzes]
-[automated voice] <i>Nein.</i>

28:22.239 --> 28:24.509
Oh. [clicks tongue]

28:24.541 --> 28:28.077
Do you have an alternative
form of payment?

28:28.112 --> 28:29.311
Mmm-hmm.

28:35.619 --> 28:37.555
Yeah.

28:37.587 --> 28:38.955
Oh...

28:38.989 --> 28:40.025
Okay.

28:40.057 --> 28:44.407
We are incredibly proud of...

28:47.532 --> 28:52.532
It seems you gentlemen
are having a small
payment issue.

28:54.972 --> 28:58.722
Let me see if I can help.

29:00.878 --> 29:03.013
-[machine buzzes]
-[automated voice] <i>Nein.</i>

29:03.048 --> 29:06.884
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to ask you and your friends

29:06.917 --> 29:10.287
to leave the premises
immediately.

29:10.320 --> 29:14.192
[stammers] Okay, wait. Um...

29:14.226 --> 29:17.461
Your brochure says you have
28 superpowers to choose from.

29:17.496 --> 29:21.432
I've got 64 personalities,
each with their own superpower.

29:21.464 --> 29:23.734
You hook up me and my friends,

29:23.768 --> 29:25.403
I'll give you some of my blood.

29:25.435 --> 29:28.538
You can use that DNA to...

29:28.573 --> 29:30.875
do whatever the hell you do.

29:30.909 --> 29:33.909
[Jane clears throat]

29:36.279 --> 29:38.882
One moment, please.

29:38.915 --> 29:42.186
Mmm.

29:42.220 --> 29:45.257
Wait, what can you people do
for, say, a guy like me?

29:45.289 --> 29:48.893
That depends on what you mean
by someone like you.

29:48.926 --> 29:51.962
Uh, well, I'm a brain
in a can. There's that.

29:51.996 --> 29:56.101
And... [laughs] Look at me.
I'm not exactly a...

29:56.134 --> 30:00.538
Uh, you know,
I don't exactly just...
[sighs]

30:00.570 --> 30:02.472
I just don't feel.

30:02.507 --> 30:05.542
Comfortable in your own skin?

30:05.576 --> 30:06.711
I don't feel anything.

30:06.743 --> 30:09.614
You must feel something.

30:09.646 --> 30:12.482
Something missing.

30:12.517 --> 30:15.185
That's why you're here.

30:15.219 --> 30:16.221
It's okay.

30:16.253 --> 30:21.253
We are all missing
something, aren't we?

30:22.292 --> 30:24.194
[yodeling music plays]

30:24.228 --> 30:26.865
Follow me, please.

30:26.897 --> 30:29.448
So we got a deal?

30:34.305 --> 30:35.305
Okay.

30:41.945 --> 30:44.195
[door creaking]

31:05.201 --> 31:07.602
[Larry grunting]

31:10.307 --> 31:12.242
Nurse, can we put back
on standby?

31:12.276 --> 31:13.510
[nurse] Yes, sir.

31:13.544 --> 31:15.278
[Larry breathes heavily]

31:15.311 --> 31:16.547
[doctor] Jesus.

31:16.580 --> 31:18.416
Let's do an exploratory
laparotomy

31:18.416 --> 31:23.386
to find and control
the source of the hemorrhage.

31:23.421 --> 31:25.820
[alarm sounding]

31:28.826 --> 31:32.125
[Larry groans, winces]

31:34.832 --> 31:37.667
[panting]

31:37.701 --> 31:39.436
[groaning]

31:39.470 --> 31:42.470
[objects clattering]

31:48.746 --> 31:50.395
Oh, my God.

32:01.826 --> 32:03.827
[indistinct chatter]

32:03.861 --> 32:05.663
-[Geiger counter clicking]
-[man 1] No movement.

32:05.695 --> 32:07.398
[man 2] Sir, there he is.

32:07.432 --> 32:09.733
[man 1] Captain Trainor,
stay where you are.

32:09.767 --> 32:12.403
Your radiation levels
are off the charts.

32:12.436 --> 32:15.172
You're a danger
to everyone around you.

32:15.204 --> 32:18.742
Do not move!

32:18.776 --> 32:21.711
[over speakers]
<i>Larry, it's Sheryl.</i>

32:21.746 --> 32:23.981
Hey.

32:24.015 --> 32:27.785
Oh, it's so good to hear
your voice, baby.

32:27.818 --> 32:29.253
Are you okay?

32:29.287 --> 32:30.821
<i>How are the boys,
are they with you?</i>

32:30.855 --> 32:33.258
No, I didn't bring them.

32:33.290 --> 32:37.028
[clears throat]
I sent them to stay
with my folks.

32:37.060 --> 32:41.560
Oh. That makes sense,
I guess.

32:42.232 --> 32:45.002
It's better to keep them
away from all this for now.

32:45.036 --> 32:50.036
I told them that Daddy
had to go away for a while,

32:50.775 --> 32:53.309
and that he might not
be coming back.

32:53.344 --> 32:55.779
You...

32:55.813 --> 32:58.016
Sheryl, listen to me.

32:58.048 --> 33:01.419
Whatever those doctors
told you is bullshit.

33:01.452 --> 33:04.821
I'm gonna get better,
and I'm gonna walk
out of this place, okay?

33:04.855 --> 33:06.857
I promise you.

33:06.891 --> 33:10.161
<i>Just hang on
a little longer for me.</i>

33:10.194 --> 33:13.230
[tearfully] I've been hanging on
a long time now, Larry.

33:13.263 --> 33:16.934
[exhales] <i>I don't think
I can do it anymore.</i>

33:16.968 --> 33:20.204
Sheryl, please.

33:20.238 --> 33:23.040
I know things have been
rough for a while.

33:23.074 --> 33:25.643
Just give me a chance
to fix this, I swear to you...

33:25.675 --> 33:28.846
You can't.

33:28.880 --> 33:31.782
[sighs] <i>I love you, Larry,</i>

33:31.816 --> 33:34.919
but you can't fix this.

33:34.952 --> 33:36.788
You can't fix any of this.

33:36.820 --> 33:39.221
You never could.

33:43.627 --> 33:46.864
I can change.

33:46.897 --> 33:50.134
We shouldn't be afraid
to admit

33:50.167 --> 33:53.037
that we deserve
better than this.

33:53.070 --> 33:54.771
Sheryl, please.

33:54.806 --> 33:56.773
Please don't do this to me.

33:56.807 --> 33:58.977
<i>I'm begging you.</i>

33:59.009 --> 34:03.114
I'm sorry.

34:03.147 --> 34:06.683
I hope that you recover
from this one day, Larry,

34:06.717 --> 34:09.353
<i>and if that happens,</i>

34:09.387 --> 34:13.523
<i>I hope that you find
the love that you deserve.</i>

34:13.556 --> 34:18.394
I really do.

34:18.429 --> 34:20.679
<i>Sheryl.</i>

34:24.268 --> 34:26.838
Sheryl.

34:26.871 --> 34:29.472
Sheryl.

34:29.507 --> 34:30.556
Sheryl!

34:36.313 --> 34:39.851
Maybe it's time we see
what better looks like.

34:39.884 --> 34:43.021
[vending machine beeping]

34:43.054 --> 34:45.454
-Dessert?
-Hmph.

34:58.402 --> 35:03.402
Look, I'm sorry I lost it
back there, okay?

35:07.777 --> 35:10.414
You're right. It is over.

35:10.447 --> 35:13.117
This whole thing has
gone to hell.

35:13.150 --> 35:18.150
All because I was trying
to prove myself to my pops.

35:29.199 --> 35:32.570
I'm used to having my dad
get into my head, but...

35:32.603 --> 35:36.574
having that Nobody guy
there, too...

35:36.608 --> 35:40.177
I just don't know
what to believe anymore.

35:40.210 --> 35:43.748
I used to exercise
rigid control over my diet.

35:43.780 --> 35:46.717
But ever since my incident,

35:46.751 --> 35:48.686
keeping my figure takes...

35:48.719 --> 35:53.525
Well, let's just say a level
of control beyond Pritikin.
[chuckles]

35:53.557 --> 35:55.760
I've learned to manage
over the years.

35:55.793 --> 35:58.463
But that overblown psychopath
got into my head, too,

35:58.496 --> 36:03.496
and I'm starting
to lose control
all over again.

36:11.943 --> 36:14.077
[Rita sighs]

36:14.112 --> 36:16.512
[trilling]

36:16.547 --> 36:19.483
Hey, Pops.

36:19.516 --> 36:23.121
No. Everything's going great.

36:23.153 --> 36:24.521
Oh. Oh, that's--

36:24.556 --> 36:26.891
No. I know
where the airport is.

36:26.923 --> 36:28.326
I have
privacy mode enabled.

36:28.358 --> 36:30.094
How are you listening?

36:30.128 --> 36:31.730
Daddy dearest
to the rescue?

36:31.762 --> 36:34.664
The Starjet's ready
and waiting if we want it.

36:34.697 --> 36:36.797
Do we want it?

36:52.617 --> 36:57.617
Welcome, Jane.
Pleased to make
your acquaintance.

37:04.295 --> 37:05.862
[metal gears squeaking]

37:05.896 --> 37:10.768
I am Sturmbanhfuhrer Von Fuchs.

37:10.800 --> 37:13.603
Do you like my puppets?

37:13.637 --> 37:17.875
[exhales]

37:17.909 --> 37:21.059
[mechanical whirring]

37:24.615 --> 37:27.786
As a man of science,
please indulge me.

37:27.818 --> 37:32.818
How did you manage
to obtain so many
metahuman abilities?

37:33.858 --> 37:35.559
You want the deal or not?

37:35.594 --> 37:39.063
I would have to meet
another of your personas

37:39.097 --> 37:41.065
and behold their power.

37:41.099 --> 37:44.735
Except it doesn't work
that way.

37:44.769 --> 37:47.704
I don't control them,
they don't control me.

37:47.704 --> 37:48.672
Oh, dear.

37:48.672 --> 37:53.010
I do imagine that must be
ever so tiresome.

37:53.045 --> 37:58.045
Constantly forced to cede
authority to your inner demons.

37:58.882 --> 38:01.085
If necessary,

38:01.119 --> 38:04.088
I could assist you with that.

38:04.121 --> 38:06.822
[breathes heavily]

38:30.181 --> 38:33.918
[breathes heavily]

38:33.951 --> 38:35.601
[crackling]

38:45.862 --> 38:49.800
It's over, isn't it?

38:49.833 --> 38:52.235
I'm free.

38:52.269 --> 38:55.340
I'm free.

38:55.373 --> 38:59.210
You could live out your days
with unfettered autonomy.

38:59.242 --> 39:01.847
I could extract the others
and their powers

39:01.880 --> 39:06.483
and leave only your
core persona in that body.

39:06.516 --> 39:08.385
Pass.

39:08.418 --> 39:10.954
Tell me, Jane.

39:10.954 --> 39:13.525
Are you not the core persona

39:13.557 --> 39:17.907
inside your little menagerie?

39:19.163 --> 39:21.565
[sinister laugh]

39:21.599 --> 39:23.668
When you get to
wherever the hell
you're going,

39:23.702 --> 39:26.737
send me a postcard,
all right?

39:26.769 --> 39:29.106
[sinister laugh]

39:29.139 --> 39:31.742
What are you doing?
[echoing]

39:31.775 --> 39:33.010
You and me are done.

39:33.043 --> 39:34.711
Move the hell out of my way.

39:34.744 --> 39:37.414
[echoing]

39:37.447 --> 39:39.983
Get the fuck out of my way!

39:40.016 --> 39:42.554
Your core, Jane.

39:42.586 --> 39:45.856
There was some kind
of trauma in her past.

39:45.889 --> 39:47.759
Yeah? When she was young.

39:47.791 --> 39:50.829
This caused her mind
to splinter,

39:50.862 --> 39:54.800
allowing you and your
other personas to manifest.

39:54.833 --> 39:58.735
All in order to protect
this innocent little girl.

39:58.737 --> 40:01.438
You want to know how
I got my powers, asshole?

40:01.472 --> 40:04.442
A group of fuckhead scientists
like you

40:04.476 --> 40:06.411
did terrible things
to an innocent girl.

40:06.443 --> 40:09.313
Except, the pursuit
of science

40:09.347 --> 40:10.882
is worth any cost.

40:10.916 --> 40:15.320
The man who
helped me escape
would disagree.

40:15.353 --> 40:19.190
Actually, I think
you may know him.

40:19.222 --> 40:21.322
Niles Caulder.

40:24.561 --> 40:26.297
[Cliff] This is good.

40:26.331 --> 40:30.380
Meaningful silence
is good.

40:38.943 --> 40:40.545
[Jane] <i>You remember Niles,
don't you?</i>

40:40.577 --> 40:43.748
The guy who shot your Nazi ass.

40:43.782 --> 40:46.217
Ten times the scientist
you'll ever be.

40:46.250 --> 40:48.219
Niles Caulder is a fraud

40:48.251 --> 40:51.155
whose intelligence
is devastatingly limited,

40:51.188 --> 40:54.958
whereas my genius
is revolutionary.

40:54.992 --> 40:56.860
[Jane] Mmm.

40:56.893 --> 40:58.463
Is it, though?

40:58.496 --> 41:00.965
A creepy old Nazi shitbag

41:00.998 --> 41:05.998
keeping himself alive
in some janky-ass iron lung...

41:07.505 --> 41:12.376
doesn't feel
super-revolutionary to me.

41:12.409 --> 41:13.610
[laughs]

41:18.248 --> 41:19.449
[laughter echoing]

41:19.483 --> 41:22.853
[electricity crackling]

41:22.887 --> 41:24.121
I don't get it.

41:24.155 --> 41:26.990
We're free from one another.
Why won't you leave me alone?

41:27.023 --> 41:29.427
Leave me alone.
Fuck you.

41:29.460 --> 41:30.809
Fuck you!

41:40.938 --> 41:44.409
Sorry, Cliff, but we
can't allow you to leave.

41:44.442 --> 41:48.079
Please remain where you are.

41:48.112 --> 41:49.813
The fuck?

41:49.847 --> 41:54.818
[all] A friend of Niles Caulder
is an enemy of Von Fuchs.

41:54.853 --> 41:58.389
Von Fuchs is <i>uber.
Von Fuchs is uber.</i>

41:58.422 --> 42:00.759
Von Fuchs is <i>uber!</i>

42:00.791 --> 42:04.461
You and I are not
so different, Jane.

42:04.494 --> 42:08.565
I find myself a little
fragmented, too.

42:08.599 --> 42:12.168
Whereas you are
one of many personalities,

42:12.202 --> 42:13.704
trapped within a single body,

42:13.737 --> 42:17.442
I am a single personality

42:17.474 --> 42:21.375
spread across many bodies.

42:28.152 --> 42:29.186

Nazi fucks.

43:23.440 --> 43:25.376
You wanna fuck with me?

43:25.409 --> 43:29.246
You want to fuck with me?

43:29.280 --> 43:32.516
[shouts]

43:32.550 --> 43:34.452
I had a life before you.

43:34.485 --> 43:37.188
People who cared about me.

43:37.221 --> 43:38.956
I had a job, I had a future.

43:38.989 --> 43:42.059
I knew who I was.

43:42.094 --> 43:44.128
But ever since the day
you crashed my jet,

43:44.161 --> 43:46.831
ever since you decided to live
inside my body,

43:46.864 --> 43:48.532
my life has been a nightmare.

43:48.565 --> 43:52.202
I had everything,
and you fucked it all up!

43:52.235 --> 43:56.907
[screeching]

43:56.942 --> 44:01.141
[John] You fucked it all up.

44:05.449 --> 44:08.552
I underestimated you.

44:08.585 --> 44:12.289
We could do
wonderful things together,

44:12.322 --> 44:15.925
you and I.

44:15.960 --> 44:20.864
What do you say?

44:20.898 --> 44:24.302
Auf wiedersehen, motherfucker.

44:24.335 --> 44:25.534
[groans]

44:37.213 --> 44:38.213
I win.

44:43.922 --> 44:48.922
Even this insignificant victory
doesn't belong to you, Jane.

44:52.262 --> 44:56.601
Nothing in your life does.

Oh, God.

45:15.552 --> 45:20.090
What did I do?

45:20.123 --> 45:21.623
[exclaims]

45:25.195 --> 45:27.465
I'm sorry. I...

45:27.498 --> 45:29.748
-You...
-Don't.

45:49.420 --> 45:51.670
[powering down]

46:04.802 --> 46:08.851
Should we search the place?

46:16.380 --> 46:18.480
Or that, yeah.

46:22.286 --> 46:23.786
[crashing]

46:33.264 --> 46:34.599
[Cliff] Nazis.

46:34.632 --> 46:36.333
[Vic] Uh-huh.

46:36.367 --> 46:39.666
Jet's a mile that way.

46:42.472 --> 46:45.322
We found the Chief.

[John] <i>Larry?
Larry, you there, bud?</i>

47:30.119 --> 47:31.255
It's John.

47:31.289 --> 47:34.291
<i>I'm here with
a few of the boys.</i>

47:34.326 --> 47:38.429
We heard you were
taking visitors,
so we hopped in my truck...

47:38.461 --> 47:41.699
<i>and here we are.</i>

47:41.733 --> 47:45.903
Looks like they got you
in a real VIP suite
here, Trainor.

47:45.936 --> 47:48.438
<i>Like you're the sultan of
I-don't-know-what.</i>

47:48.438 --> 47:49.440
[chuckles]

47:49.474 --> 47:54.474
<i>Be a real thrill
to hear your voice, Lar.</i>

47:54.679 --> 47:57.414
Oh, hey, here's a laugh.

47:57.447 --> 47:59.884
Guess who re-upped?

47:59.918 --> 48:01.619
<i>That's right.</i>

48:01.652 --> 48:06.623
Not going anywhere
till the Air Force
kicks me out.

48:06.657 --> 48:08.226
Yeah, I thought
about the poor bastard

48:08.260 --> 48:10.394
<i>who'd get assigned to you
if I left,</i>

48:10.429 --> 48:12.831
<i>and I just felt terrible
for the guy.</i>

48:12.864 --> 48:17.601
I think I'm the only one
who knows how to deal
with your bullshit, Trainor...

48:17.635 --> 48:19.903
<i>so you're stuck with me.</i>

48:19.938 --> 48:21.806
<i>You hear me, buddy?</i>

48:21.838 --> 48:26.409
I'm not going anywhere.

48:26.443 --> 48:29.293
I'll be right here.

Hey, Lar, uh...

48:46.264 --> 48:51.264
I didn't read you, buddy.
you wanna run that back by me?

48:53.237 --> 48:54.237
Go.

49:00.577 --> 49:02.077
Copy that.

49:07.617 --> 49:10.922
You must be all kinds of tired.

49:10.954 --> 49:15.492
<i>We'll let you get your rest.</i>

49:15.525 --> 49:19.275
