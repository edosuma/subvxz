00:01.577 --> 00:02.911
Previously on Royal Pains...

00:02.912 --> 00:04.245
Marisa has diagnosed me, Hank.

00:04.246 --> 00:06.314
You convinced Marisa to defect?

00:06.315 --> 00:08.450
She's coming to live
here at Shadow Pond.

00:08.451 --> 00:10.352
- Is everything okay?
- Marisa's been arrested.

00:10.353 --> 00:11.786
Arrested?

00:11.787 --> 00:13.088
In Cuba?

00:13.089 --> 00:14.923
Would you be willing
to be my faux beau...

00:14.924 --> 00:17.125
- My pretend boyfriend?
- I don't want your money.

00:17.126 --> 00:18.793
Can you have dinner
with me next Saturday?

00:18.794 --> 00:20.128
No, I'm off your payroll.

00:20.129 --> 00:21.630
I don't want to pay you.

00:21.631 --> 00:23.098
I want to have dinner with you.

00:23.099 --> 00:24.633
I thought Raj was in Seattle.

00:24.634 --> 00:27.302
He stopped off to see me
on his way back to London.

00:27.303 --> 00:28.737
Sounds like things
are going well.

00:28.738 --> 00:30.705
They are.

00:30.706 --> 00:32.807
That's the guy who donated
his kidney to his housekeeper?

00:32.808 --> 00:34.309
You just didn't mention
that he's kind of hot.

00:34.310 --> 00:35.543
Divya,

00:35.544 --> 00:37.212
- that ring on your finger...
- I'm engaged.

00:37.213 --> 00:39.481
I went to Dad's house
the other day,

00:39.482 --> 00:41.783
and I found
a Shadow Pond letterhead.

00:41.784 --> 00:43.018
I'm Eddie R. Lawson.

00:43.019 --> 00:45.120
I know exactly who you are.

00:45.121 --> 00:47.055
What the hell?

00:49.000 --> 00:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:06.575 --> 01:08.943
Yeah, this is Hank.

01:10.713 --> 01:12.681
Yeah, I'll be there.

01:25.361 --> 01:27.128
Hey, what's up?

01:27.129 --> 01:28.830
Oh, I need your help, Hank.

01:28.831 --> 01:30.298
Yeah, I'd agree.

01:30.299 --> 01:31.733
You look exhausted
and depleted.

01:31.734 --> 01:33.001
Thank you.

01:33.002 --> 01:34.402
Maybe we should do a workup,

01:34.403 --> 01:36.337
make sure there's no change
in your status.

01:36.338 --> 01:37.872
It has nothing to do
with my status

01:37.873 --> 01:39.307
and a great deal to do
with the fact

01:39.308 --> 01:40.809
that I haven't slept
for a number of days.

01:40.810 --> 01:42.877
Yeah, that would do it too.

01:42.878 --> 01:45.947
And I can't foresee a respite
coming anytime soon.

01:45.948 --> 01:48.116
I have to leave, uh,
for an important meeting.

01:48.117 --> 01:50.118
Okay.

01:50.119 --> 01:52.854
I need something to, um...

01:52.855 --> 01:55.190
sustain me.

01:55.191 --> 01:56.858
Like what?

01:56.859 --> 01:59.994
Like dextroamphetamine,
perhaps.

01:59.995 --> 02:01.796
Well, that sounds
like an informed choice,

02:01.797 --> 02:04.199
so I'll assume you're aware
of the possible side effects?

02:04.200 --> 02:06.000
Such as what, Hank?

02:06.001 --> 02:08.502
Stroke, cardiomyopathy,
hypertensive crisis, what?

02:08.503 --> 02:09.937
All unlikely, yes,

02:09.939 --> 02:11.573
but ill-advised risks
for a guy trying to keep

02:11.574 --> 02:13.875
a serious genetic disease at bay.

02:13.876 --> 02:15.977
Look, how about we start
with a banana bag?

02:15.978 --> 02:17.479
IV fluids with the vitamins and minerals

02:17.480 --> 02:18.880
You need to replenish.

02:18.881 --> 02:20.315
Don't have time
to sit for an IV .

02:20.316 --> 02:21.983
Well, I can hang it on
a coat hook in your car, then.

02:24.553 --> 02:27.822
I'm not driving.

02:36.532 --> 02:37.766
Hey.

02:39.101 --> 02:40.368
Hello.

02:40.369 --> 02:41.703
What are you doing here?

02:41.704 --> 02:43.638
I come here every morning.

02:43.639 --> 02:45.707
Right, yes. I forgot.

02:45.708 --> 02:46.841
Wow.

02:46.842 --> 02:49.177
It's a beautiful day, huh?

02:49.178 --> 02:50.512
It's really nice.

02:50.513 --> 02:52.914
You know, I miss this,

02:52.915 --> 02:55.884
just hanging out together,
you and me,

02:55.885 --> 02:58.353
me and you.

02:58.354 --> 03:00.588
Okay.

03:00.589 --> 03:04.058
I'm ambushing you
so that we can talk about Boris.

03:04.059 --> 03:05.493
What about him?

03:05.494 --> 03:06.528
Well, he's pissed at me

03:06.529 --> 03:08.163
because I used his name
with Dr. Blair.

03:08.164 --> 03:10.131
You know how he is
about privacy.

03:10.132 --> 03:11.633
He seemed like he was worried

03:11.634 --> 03:13.201
about more than
just his privacy.

03:13.202 --> 03:15.203
Well, he does have a lot
on his plate right now.

03:15.204 --> 03:16.971
Oh! Whoa!
Whoa! Okay!

03:16.972 --> 03:18.840
- Oh, my God!
- Uh, hello.

03:18.841 --> 03:20.975
- Oh, I am sorry.
- Thank you.

03:20.976 --> 03:22.443
And, really, I am sorry.

03:22.444 --> 03:23.511
- Oh.
- Ooh, ooh, ooh.

03:23.512 --> 03:24.879
Uh, here, have a seat.

03:24.880 --> 03:27.348
- Is it your ankle?
- Uh, yeah.

03:27.349 --> 03:28.683
First I was walking,

03:28.684 --> 03:30.218
and then, suddenly,
I was flying,

03:30.219 --> 03:32.754
and I have no idea
what went wrong in between.

03:32.755 --> 03:34.556
I'm AJ.

03:34.557 --> 03:36.491
I'm Jill, and this is Hank.

03:36.492 --> 03:38.026
He's a single doctor,

03:38.027 --> 03:40.895
so he's used to beautiful women
just falling in his lap.

03:40.896 --> 03:43.698
Well, I guess I have good aim.

03:43.699 --> 03:46.201
Uh, Jill, can you grab me
some granola bags,

03:46.202 --> 03:47.402
cardboard sleeves, tape,

03:47.403 --> 03:49.971
and, uh,
another muffin, please?

03:49.972 --> 03:52.040
- Sure.
- Thank you.

03:52.041 --> 03:54.409
Do you think
you can stand and walk?

03:54.410 --> 03:55.810
Yeah...

03:55.811 --> 03:58.580
Although that's what I thought
the last time I tried.

03:58.581 --> 04:00.849
Well, maybe try using a bit
more of the ground this time.

04:00.850 --> 04:02.217
You mean barefoot?

04:02.218 --> 04:05.153
These floors are barely
clean enough for my shoes.

04:05.154 --> 04:06.654
I think the risk
of infection is minimal.

04:06.655 --> 04:09.324
Can you take four steps
there, AJ?

04:09.325 --> 04:10.792
Come here.

04:10.793 --> 04:12.327
Ohh. Oh!

04:12.328 --> 04:14.662
All right, have a seat.
Okay, yeah.

04:14.663 --> 04:17.098
Looks like a sprain,
no fracture.

04:17.099 --> 04:20.168
Thank you.

04:21.670 --> 04:23.471
Uh, you should get
a real aircast,

04:23.472 --> 04:24.739
but this'll do for now.

04:32.081 --> 04:34.015
There we go.
That should do it.

04:34.016 --> 04:37.252
I am beyond impressed.

04:37.253 --> 04:39.187
If it swells up
or becomes painful

04:39.188 --> 04:41.623
or you need
a fruity topping, call me.

04:41.624 --> 04:44.359
Oh, Hank of Hankmed...
of course.

04:44.360 --> 04:46.895
You've... you have built
quite a buzz for yourself

04:46.896 --> 04:48.129
out here this summer.

04:48.130 --> 04:49.230
Oh, well...

04:49.231 --> 04:51.132
Everything you've heard is true.

04:51.133 --> 04:53.234
Oh, you know what?
I got to run...

04:53.235 --> 04:54.269
Limp...

04:54.270 --> 04:56.371
to a gallery opening
in Sag Harbor.

04:56.372 --> 04:57.639
Um, thank you.

04:57.640 --> 04:59.807
And, um, I'm gonna put
a check in the mail

04:59.808 --> 05:02.744
for the exam
and, uh, the muffin.

05:02.745 --> 05:05.980
That's really not necessary.

05:13.756 --> 05:15.556
Well, well, well.

05:15.557 --> 05:18.059
We are so happy
you're both here.

05:18.060 --> 05:20.728
For our very special
announcement.

05:20.729 --> 05:21.930
Announcement?

05:21.931 --> 05:25.133
Miss Newberg and I

05:25.134 --> 05:26.935
are moving in together.

05:28.270 --> 05:30.038
We're cohabitating...

05:30.039 --> 05:31.472
taking it up a notch.

05:33.676 --> 05:35.410
Isn't it fabulous?

05:35.411 --> 05:37.912
Yeah, it's...
it's definitely shocking.

05:37.913 --> 05:39.113
He means surprising...

05:39.114 --> 05:41.416
You know, uh,
pleasantly surprising.

05:41.417 --> 05:44.352
It's pleasantly
surprisingly shocking.

05:45.587 --> 05:47.989
You all right, Dad?
Dad, you all right?

05:47.990 --> 05:49.357
What's going on?

05:49.358 --> 05:51.092
- Just breathe.
- I have a lump in my throat.

05:51.093 --> 05:52.660
Oh, my God, he's choking!

05:52.661 --> 05:54.495
- He's definitely not choking.
- I can hear my heart beating.

05:54.496 --> 05:56.998
Okay, just re...
uh, sorry, I need that.

05:56.999 --> 05:59.500
Dad, Dad, just breathe.

05:59.501 --> 06:02.170
In and out of this bag
right there.

06:02.171 --> 06:03.471
That's it.

06:03.472 --> 06:05.139
He's not having
a heart attack, right?

06:05.140 --> 06:06.674
I feel better already.

06:06.675 --> 06:08.376
Okay, it could
just be anxiety.

06:10.612 --> 06:12.313
If the the truth be told,

06:12.314 --> 06:15.216
I'm a little anxious
about the cohabitating thing,

06:15.217 --> 06:18.653
'cause I haven't lived
with anybody since your Mom.

06:18.654 --> 06:21.222
I hope you understand, Shmoopy.

06:21.223 --> 06:22.890
Of course I do.

06:22.891 --> 06:27.695
But we both know you have
another source of stress.

06:27.696 --> 06:30.298
He's been burning the candle
at both ends,

06:30.299 --> 06:32.300
trying to launch Bluesky.

06:32.301 --> 06:35.269
Oh, he's been sweating
and restless.

06:35.270 --> 06:37.972
I've never seen my dad
sweat a drop in his whole life.

06:37.973 --> 06:40.608
Okay, look, it was...
it was probably a panic attack.

06:40.609 --> 06:42.844
I'll give you some baby aspirin,
just in case.

06:42.845 --> 06:44.979
If the chest pain returns,
you need to call me immediately.

06:44.980 --> 06:46.347
Will do, Kiddo.

06:46.348 --> 06:47.915
Okay, and I want to do
a stress test today.

06:47.916 --> 06:49.250
Today. Today.

06:49.251 --> 06:50.885
You know what?

06:50.886 --> 06:52.987
Um, what I really need
is some, um, fresh air.

06:52.988 --> 06:55.156
- Okay, let's go outside.
- Thank you.

06:55.157 --> 06:56.991
We'll be right back.

07:46.045 --> 07:48.479
Divya, it's good
to see you again.

07:48.480 --> 07:51.049
Yes, you too.

07:51.050 --> 07:53.484
How is Tali?
Is she okay?

07:53.485 --> 07:55.753
I didn't call you for Tali.
I called you for myself.

07:55.754 --> 07:59.924
I mean, uh,
I'm not feeling too hot.

07:59.925 --> 08:03.094
Well, can you describe
what you're experiencing?

08:03.095 --> 08:05.496
Chronic fatigue

08:05.497 --> 08:08.266
and decreased urine output.

08:08.267 --> 08:09.934
Good description.

08:09.935 --> 08:11.202
Uh, maybe I'm overreacting,

08:11.203 --> 08:12.937
But everyone says
I should be vigilant.

08:12.938 --> 08:14.138
Well, they're right.
You should.

08:14.139 --> 08:15.706
Since I only have
half as many kidneys

08:15.707 --> 08:17.141
as the average guy.

08:17.142 --> 08:20.411
Well, let's be thorough
in determining

08:20.412 --> 08:23.247
what, if anything, is going on.

08:23.248 --> 08:24.849
Wow.

08:24.850 --> 08:27.452
So I call, and you show up.

08:27.453 --> 08:29.687
It really works just like that.

08:29.688 --> 08:31.656
Give or take
a few minutes, yeah.

08:31.657 --> 08:33.357
I bet you see
a lot of celebrities.

08:33.357 --> 08:34.859
I wouldn't say a lot.

08:34.860 --> 08:36.260
How many would you say?

08:36.260 --> 08:38.196
- I wouldn't say.
- Hmm.

08:38.197 --> 08:40.898
So should I, uh... should I have
a look at that ankle?

08:40.899 --> 08:42.533
Oh, I didn't call you
about my ankle.

08:42.534 --> 08:44.034
Oh. Is something else wrong?

08:44.035 --> 08:49.273
Um, well, you know, I just
feel generally like poop.

08:49.274 --> 08:50.641
Oh.

08:50.642 --> 08:52.343
Could it be
from my ankle sprain?

08:52.344 --> 08:53.611
Uh, I doubt that,
but I'd need you to be

08:53.612 --> 08:55.680
a touch more specific
than "poop".

08:55.681 --> 08:58.516
I feel...

08:58.517 --> 09:00.251
Spacey, uh,

09:00.252 --> 09:02.653
achy, nauseated.

09:02.654 --> 09:04.822
I've had this
once or twice before.

09:04.823 --> 09:06.124
My late husband
used to treat it

09:06.125 --> 09:07.825
with a blanket
and a hot cup of tea.

09:07.826 --> 09:09.994
Hmm. Was he a doctor?

09:09.995 --> 09:11.162
No.

09:14.366 --> 09:15.900
Just a gentleman.

09:15.901 --> 09:18.736
Could you, perchance,
direct me

09:18.737 --> 09:23.241
to the nearest linen closet
and the kitchen, Ms.?

09:23.242 --> 09:25.877
I have a confession to make.

09:25.878 --> 09:28.079
Uh, that's outside
my scope of practice.

09:29.214 --> 09:31.382
I googled you
before you came over.

09:31.383 --> 09:32.650
And what were you looking for?

09:32.651 --> 09:34.785
Your story...
where are you from?

09:34.786 --> 09:36.154
What brought you
to the Hamptons?

09:36.155 --> 09:37.355
Just relax now.

09:37.356 --> 09:39.190
How is it that you're cute,

09:39.191 --> 09:41.926
and you're a doctor,
and you're still single?

09:41.927 --> 09:43.694
And is it true

09:43.695 --> 09:45.830
you live on
Boris Kuester-Ratenicz's estate?

09:45.831 --> 09:49.200
It's actually Boris Kuester
von JÃ¼rgens-Ratenicz.

09:49.201 --> 09:50.668
- Oh, right.
- Yeah.

09:50.669 --> 09:54.338
I heard he has his own fleet
of Formula 1 race cars

09:54.339 --> 09:56.274
and that he dated
Angelina Jolie once...

09:56.275 --> 09:58.843
- Hmm.
- Possibly twice.

09:58.844 --> 10:00.211
- Really?
- And I heard

10:00.212 --> 10:04.282
he has a ridiculous
hacienda in Cuba.

10:04.283 --> 10:06.083
Well, this is the Hamptons.

10:06.084 --> 10:08.586
People love to talk.

10:10.389 --> 10:11.923
Not everyone, I guess.

10:14.726 --> 10:16.727
Hi, you've reached
Eddie R. Lawson,

10:16.728 --> 10:18.062
CEO of Bluesky.

10:18.063 --> 10:20.097
Please leave a message.
Thanks a lot.

10:20.098 --> 10:22.166
Dad, you can run
from the stress test,

10:22.167 --> 10:23.501
but you can't hide.

10:23.502 --> 10:24.569
I will find you.

10:27.072 --> 10:29.273
He's being elusive
for a change.

10:31.243 --> 10:33.344
Ev, what's up?

10:33.345 --> 10:37.915
I saw Dad the other night
in a parking lot with some dude,

10:37.916 --> 10:40.084
like, some shady-looking dude.

10:40.085 --> 10:41.485
I don't know...
it looked like

10:41.486 --> 10:43.321
some kind of a meeting
or something.

10:43.322 --> 10:44.455
You were following him?

10:44.456 --> 10:47.058
I don't care for that term.

10:47.059 --> 10:48.826
Hmm, sorry to offend
your sensibilities.

10:48.827 --> 10:52.463
Then I saw
the same dude again at brunch...

10:52.464 --> 10:54.198
Same guy.

10:54.199 --> 10:55.633
Remember when Dad freaked out?

10:55.634 --> 10:58.803
The guy was sitting
right across from him.

10:58.804 --> 10:59.837
I don't like it.

10:59.838 --> 11:01.606
I don't like it at all.

11:01.607 --> 11:03.241
All right, well, we'll go
to Newberg's tomorrow,

11:03.242 --> 11:04.742
do the stress test,

11:04.743 --> 11:06.744
and if he's not in a fragile
state, we'll talk to him.

11:06.745 --> 11:08.946
I like it.
I like it a lot.

11:08.947 --> 11:12.550
Please stop talking like that.
Stop talking like that now.

11:17.522 --> 11:21.158
So it was my family
and all my friends,

11:21.159 --> 11:22.727
and then the entire waitstaff

11:22.728 --> 11:24.929
came in to sing me
Happy Birthday.

11:24.930 --> 11:29.734
So that's how it became
my favorite restaurant in town.

11:29.735 --> 11:33.204
Yeah, yeah, completely.

11:33.205 --> 11:35.039
Also, I'm pregnant...

11:35.040 --> 11:36.274
with triplets.

11:36.275 --> 11:37.942
Yeah.

11:37.943 --> 11:40.645
It's gonna be tough on me
in a maximum-security prison,

11:40.646 --> 11:42.246
don't you think?

11:42.247 --> 11:45.650
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I agree
a thousand percent.

11:45.651 --> 11:49.320
Evan, you've been distracted
all night.

11:49.321 --> 11:51.188
I have?

11:51.189 --> 11:53.758
You poured creamer
on your cheesecake.

11:53.759 --> 11:55.459
I...
Yeah.

11:55.460 --> 11:58.562
And then you tried to pay
using your Triple-A card.

11:58.563 --> 12:00.698
Yeah.

12:00.699 --> 12:03.367
I don't know... I guess I have
a lot on my mind.

12:06.772 --> 12:08.239
Can I ask you something?

12:08.240 --> 12:12.710
Yeah, of course you can...
anything you want.

12:12.711 --> 12:16.347
How come I wasn't invited
to your family brunch?

12:16.348 --> 12:18.482
Because when my family
was in town,

12:18.483 --> 12:21.752
you came along
for every activity.

12:21.753 --> 12:23.721
Well...

12:23.722 --> 12:27.124
That's because you paid me to.

12:27.125 --> 12:29.660
Does your Dad
think I'm too rich?

12:29.661 --> 12:31.529
No, no.

12:31.530 --> 12:35.232
My Dad would not hold that
against you, no.

12:35.233 --> 12:37.568
So...

12:37.569 --> 12:39.170
Why can't I get to know Eddie?

12:42.974 --> 12:46.177
Because I need to get
to know him first.

12:46.178 --> 12:50.915
Yeah, I have no idea
what that means,

12:50.916 --> 12:54.618
but if you want to tell me,
I'd love to listen.

12:56.888 --> 12:58.389
Evan...

12:58.390 --> 13:00.658
Let me help you through this.

13:02.594 --> 13:04.829
Sounds like a plan.

13:06.498 --> 13:08.032
And I promise

13:08.033 --> 13:10.601
I will come visit you
and the triplets in prison.

13:25.851 --> 13:27.785
what's wrong with her?

13:27.786 --> 13:29.954
She just said
she's feeling worse.

13:29.955 --> 13:31.589
What's going on with Adam?

13:31.590 --> 13:33.391
It's a little vague there
as well.

13:33.392 --> 13:34.759
Symptoms?

13:34.760 --> 13:38.629
Lethargy, um, joint pain,
and a loss of appetite.

13:38.630 --> 13:41.899
- What'd you get?
- CBC, indices, and a CMP.

13:41.900 --> 13:43.467
Good.

13:56.815 --> 13:59.150
AJ?

14:00.886 --> 14:03.687
AJ!

14:03.688 --> 14:05.222
Step back.

14:23.481 --> 14:25.482
What were you doing
before we came?

14:25.483 --> 14:27.050
Um...

14:27.051 --> 14:29.486
I was sitting,
reading a magazine.

14:29.487 --> 14:30.787
What happened
when you stood up?

14:30.788 --> 14:33.223
I got dizzy...

14:33.224 --> 14:34.591
and then dizzier.

14:34.592 --> 14:36.059
Orthostatic hypotension.

14:36.060 --> 14:37.294
What's that?

14:37.295 --> 14:38.829
It's a sudden drop
in blood pressure

14:38.830 --> 14:40.564
when you stand up.

14:40.565 --> 14:43.333
Yeah, which causes syncope,
a fainting episode.

14:43.334 --> 14:44.735
Are you having headaches?

14:44.736 --> 14:46.103
Yes.

14:46.104 --> 14:49.139
Yes, and I see flashing lights

14:49.140 --> 14:51.008
right before
the headaches begin.

14:51.009 --> 14:52.876
Uh-huh, they're called auras.

14:52.877 --> 14:55.779
So does that mean
I can never sit down again?

14:55.780 --> 14:57.614
Or never stand up again?

14:57.615 --> 14:59.816
Her temp and BP are normal.

14:59.817 --> 15:01.685
And so was her blood work.

15:01.686 --> 15:03.754
AJ, open your mouth
for me.

15:06.557 --> 15:08.425
Saliva present in the mucosa,

15:08.426 --> 15:10.694
lips aren't cracked or dry.

15:12.263 --> 15:14.865
Capillary refill
less than two seconds.

15:14.866 --> 15:16.967
Her volume isn't contracted.

15:16.968 --> 15:19.136
I'll get her some water anyway.

15:19.137 --> 15:22.005
Sorry about the window.

15:22.006 --> 15:24.574
Oh, that's okay.
I'm enjoying the breeze.

15:24.575 --> 15:26.743
So what's wrong with me, Hank?

15:26.744 --> 15:28.145
Honestly, I don't know.

15:28.146 --> 15:30.547
I don't see anything
diagnostically,

15:30.548 --> 15:32.249
but the symptoms
you describe concern me.

15:32.250 --> 15:33.717
I want you to get an MRI.

15:35.420 --> 15:39.523
I like the Pollock you have
hanging on the wall out there.

15:39.524 --> 15:41.425
My husband was
into the Hamptons art scene.

15:41.426 --> 15:44.561
So you have
your own MRI machine?

15:44.562 --> 15:46.630
Must be nice to work for a guy

15:46.631 --> 15:48.932
who owns his own private bank.

15:48.933 --> 15:50.634
No, no, we... we don't own an MRI.

15:50.635 --> 15:51.735
It's at the hospital.

15:51.736 --> 15:54.104
Oh.

15:54.105 --> 15:56.506
You know, I'm not a big fan
of hospitals.

15:56.507 --> 15:59.176
I much prefer...

15:59.177 --> 16:00.977
You.

16:00.978 --> 16:03.413
We can make sure
that your experience there

16:03.414 --> 16:05.849
is as smooth as possible.

16:05.850 --> 16:08.318
Oh, because of Hank's
on-again-off-again

16:08.319 --> 16:10.253
Summer fling with Jill Casey?

16:10.254 --> 16:12.255
Oh, you know Jill Casey?

16:12.256 --> 16:15.158
No, no, but I read
about her and Hank online...

16:15.159 --> 16:17.094
Danspapers.com .

16:17.095 --> 16:18.895
Yeah, AJ googled me.

16:18.896 --> 16:21.531
I am sure she'll google you,
too, as soon as we leave here.

16:21.532 --> 16:23.767
Oh, I'm not
a very satisfying "googlee",

16:23.768 --> 16:26.870
although my fiance
and I are registered

16:26.871 --> 16:28.738
on weddingchannel.com,

16:28.739 --> 16:30.607
if you'd like
to buy us a toaster.

16:30.608 --> 16:32.742
And by the way,
you do know Jill Casey.

16:32.743 --> 16:34.144
You met her when you met me.

16:34.145 --> 16:37.114
Oh! Of course that was Jill.

16:37.115 --> 16:39.282
So how is her clinic doing?

16:39.283 --> 16:43.120
Word is she has
a very wealthy White Knight?

16:43.121 --> 16:45.122
- No comment.
- On which part?

16:45.123 --> 16:46.923
Take your pick.

16:46.924 --> 16:48.892
You know, I have to say, Hank,

16:48.893 --> 16:52.729
I find your coyness
rather adorable.

16:52.730 --> 16:53.797
See ya, AJ

16:56.934 --> 16:59.803
Well, she's quite
the gossip queen, isn't she?

16:59.804 --> 17:03.573
where I come from,
they'd call her a yenta-mouth.

17:03.574 --> 17:05.709
- Yenta-mouth?
- Mm-hmm.

17:05.710 --> 17:07.277
I like it.

17:07.278 --> 17:09.813
I think she wants you
to give her

17:09.814 --> 17:11.781
some mouth-to-yenta-mouth.

17:11.781 --> 17:13.617
- Oh, really?
- Uh-huh.

17:13.617 --> 17:16.051
First of all,
not quite the right usage.

17:16.053 --> 17:18.855
Second, she became a widow
at a young age, you know?

17:18.856 --> 17:21.023
I think... I think
she's just lonely.

17:21.025 --> 17:23.059
Perhaps she should spend
some of her alone time

17:23.060 --> 17:25.228
studying her late husband's artwork.

17:25.229 --> 17:27.931
Her Pollock was hanging upside down.

17:27.932 --> 17:30.400
How many people can tell
if a Pollock is right side up?

17:33.237 --> 17:35.205
Oh, Adam's blood work.

17:35.206 --> 17:36.573
Hmm.

17:36.574 --> 17:38.508
His potassium is high normal.

17:38.509 --> 17:39.976
Which isn't a problem

17:39.977 --> 17:41.978
as long as his kidney
is functioning normally.

17:41.979 --> 17:44.347
I better get
a renal ultrasound right away.

17:44.348 --> 17:46.016
Okay, you want me to come
with you?

17:46.017 --> 17:49.085
No. No, I can handle
it myself.

17:49.086 --> 17:50.921
Okay, I'll see you later.

18:04.602 --> 18:07.270
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

18:07.271 --> 18:08.905
We need to talk.

18:08.906 --> 18:10.874
Here? Now?

18:10.875 --> 18:12.042
It's been a month.

18:12.043 --> 18:13.710
Your debt's still outstanding.

18:13.711 --> 18:15.979
That envelope you gave me
didn't quite cover it.

18:15.980 --> 18:18.481
You know, I am this close.
I can taste it.

18:18.482 --> 18:21.318
The only thing I see you
tasting is gourmet sandwiches.

18:21.319 --> 18:24.921
Smoked ham and Brie
with apricot relish, right?

18:24.922 --> 18:29.025
Same sandwich you had here
with your younger son,

18:29.026 --> 18:31.094
Evan R. Lawson,

18:31.095 --> 18:33.496
the CFO of Hankmed, right?

18:33.497 --> 18:35.065
Okay, now, you listen to me.

18:35.066 --> 18:36.099
We'll be in touch, Eddie.

18:36.100 --> 18:37.767
You just stay
right where you are.

18:37.768 --> 18:40.570
Thanks.

18:47.678 --> 18:50.814
Your hands are quite swollen.

18:50.815 --> 18:53.850
You probably say that
to all your male patients.

18:53.851 --> 18:56.353
Edema is not a joke, Adam.

18:56.354 --> 18:57.587
Sorry.

18:59.757 --> 19:02.158
So what are you looking for?

19:02.159 --> 19:06.196
Well, a few different
possibilities.

19:06.197 --> 19:09.099
You are moderately hyperkalemic,

19:09.100 --> 19:11.501
which means
that your potassium is high.

19:11.502 --> 19:14.037
Learn a new word every day.

19:15.673 --> 19:17.874
I learned a new word
myself today.

19:17.875 --> 19:19.209
Lie back.

19:19.210 --> 19:20.577
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

19:20.578 --> 19:21.978
Was it a big one?

19:21.979 --> 19:24.114
No, but a good one.

19:24.115 --> 19:25.382
Hmm?

19:25.383 --> 19:27.651
Yenta-mouth.

19:27.652 --> 19:29.219
That is a good one.

19:32.290 --> 19:34.357
Divya?

19:34.358 --> 19:36.159
Yes?

19:36.160 --> 19:38.328
My heart is racing.

19:45.469 --> 19:48.338
And my...
my chest is hurting.

19:52.076 --> 19:54.711
Okay, I need you to lift
your legs up, Adam!

19:54.712 --> 19:56.079
You're gonna be okay.

19:56.080 --> 19:58.815
Okay.

20:17.668 --> 20:20.270
116 Mayfield Avenue
in Water Mill...

20:20.271 --> 20:23.173
I have a kidney donor
in acute VT.

20:23.174 --> 20:25.275
Please hurry.

20:27.923 --> 20:30.124
You mentioned
that you contracted malaria.

20:30.125 --> 20:31.593
In Afghanistan.

20:31.594 --> 20:33.895
But the doctors medicated it,
and it subsided.

20:33.896 --> 20:35.396
Well, what you have now

20:35.397 --> 20:37.966
is called membranous
glomerulonephritis.

20:37.967 --> 20:40.001
All the catchy names
were taken?

20:41.971 --> 20:43.972
Did the transplant cause it?

20:43.973 --> 20:47.742
No, but having one kidney
does complicate the matter.

20:47.743 --> 20:52.914
The decision to donate
was so simple.

20:52.915 --> 20:55.650
I never paid too much attention
to the fine print.

20:55.651 --> 20:57.886
It's likely that the malaria

20:57.887 --> 21:00.221
clogged your kidney's
filtration system.

21:00.222 --> 21:02.790
That's why the potassium
was accumulating in your blood,

21:02.791 --> 21:04.659
which irritated your heart

21:04.660 --> 21:08.897
and led to that severe
arrhythmia in your backyard.

21:08.898 --> 21:11.132
You sure we weren't
just having a moment?

21:12.835 --> 21:15.069
Could it happen again?

21:15.070 --> 21:18.439
You'll need, uh,
some dietary adjustments

21:18.440 --> 21:22.076
and a drug called Kayexalate.

21:22.077 --> 21:24.546
Mm.

21:26.415 --> 21:28.483
For how long?

21:28.484 --> 21:31.519
Well, it depends
on how you recover.

21:31.520 --> 21:33.288
So...

21:35.424 --> 21:37.625
How am I gonna recover?

21:37.626 --> 21:41.663
Well, this condition follows
the rule of threes.

21:41.664 --> 21:45.867
1/3 of patients experience
spontaneous remission.

21:45.868 --> 21:48.002
1/3 of patients end up

21:48.003 --> 21:51.005
with impaired,
but stable kidney function.

21:51.006 --> 21:53.308
And the other third?

21:53.309 --> 21:55.944
Progressive disease,

21:55.945 --> 21:57.445
renal failure.

22:03.619 --> 22:06.854
But rules
are made to be broken.

22:09.291 --> 22:12.961
So I guess we'll need
to see more of each other...

22:15.331 --> 22:18.666
as we find out which third
I'm destined to fall into.

22:26.375 --> 22:30.445
I need to check in
with your nephrologist.

23:19.662 --> 23:21.095
Hi. I'm AJ.

23:21.096 --> 23:24.198
Hey. Evan R. Lawson,
CFO of Hankmed.

23:24.199 --> 23:25.933
I have an appointment
with Hank.

23:25.934 --> 23:28.369
Oh.
You do? Okay.

23:28.370 --> 23:30.104
Great.

23:31.607 --> 23:34.409
Maybe he forgot
to put it in... again.

23:34.410 --> 23:36.044
Um, have a seat.

23:36.045 --> 23:38.913
Yeah, Hank should be back soon.

23:41.083 --> 23:44.218
So, CFO...

23:44.219 --> 23:46.721
That means the money guy.

23:46.722 --> 23:48.890
I prefer fiscal gentleman,

23:48.891 --> 23:50.825
But, uh, yeah,
I'm the money guy, yeah.

23:50.826 --> 23:52.927
And the "R"?

23:52.928 --> 23:54.495
What does that stand for?

23:54.496 --> 23:55.897
The "R"?

23:55.898 --> 23:57.799
I inherited that.
It's from my Dad...

23:57.800 --> 23:59.767
Eddie R. Lawson.

23:59.768 --> 24:01.302
Get out of here.

24:01.303 --> 24:03.071
I inherited
my Dad's initials too.

24:03.072 --> 24:04.439
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

24:04.440 --> 24:06.841
- Aaron Jeffrey Peters.
- Hmm.

24:06.842 --> 24:08.342
He was a good man.

24:08.343 --> 24:10.211
Oh.

24:10.212 --> 24:13.715
Are you and your Dad close?

24:13.716 --> 24:17.151
I barely know him. Um...

24:17.152 --> 24:18.720
I'm trying to change that.

24:18.721 --> 24:21.022
He's... he's, like,
not making it very easy.

24:21.023 --> 24:23.191
He's dodging questions
and keeping secrets

24:23.192 --> 24:26.360
and just...
just stuff like that.

24:26.361 --> 24:28.529
It sounds like we come
from similar men.

24:28.530 --> 24:32.033
Whenever my Dad needed help
with stuff,

24:32.034 --> 24:34.602
he didn't trust me enough
to ask for it.

24:34.603 --> 24:35.870
Totally.

24:35.871 --> 24:37.939
That's totally what he does.

24:37.940 --> 24:39.407
Hank.
Can't talk right now.

24:39.408 --> 24:41.509
Dr. Lawson!

24:41.510 --> 24:42.810
Your patient.

24:42.811 --> 24:44.112
Hi, Hank.

24:44.113 --> 24:45.880
AJ.

24:45.881 --> 24:48.349
Uh, what are you...
why are you here?

24:48.350 --> 24:50.218
You were supposed to go
to the hospital.

24:50.219 --> 24:53.087
Oh, I am such an idiot.

24:53.088 --> 24:56.157
You said the MRI
was at Hamptons Heritage.

24:56.158 --> 24:58.226
You didn't have another
syncopal episode, did you?

24:58.227 --> 24:59.460
No, no, I'm fine,

24:59.461 --> 25:02.096
Just a little harried today,
that's all.

25:02.097 --> 25:04.298
Evan, it was so nice to meet you.

25:04.299 --> 25:05.533
You too.

25:05.534 --> 25:07.835
- Bye.
- Bye.

25:09.471 --> 25:11.139
Dude, who was that?

25:11.140 --> 25:12.707
I got to run.

25:14.610 --> 25:17.011
Marisa.

25:17.012 --> 25:19.046
Hank.

25:19.047 --> 25:20.915
Her incarceration was taxing.

25:20.916 --> 25:22.717
- In Cuba?
- Yeah, I'd imagine.

25:22.718 --> 25:25.620
Check her for everything,
all right? Infection...

25:25.621 --> 25:27.588
Mi corazÃ³n,
we're both doctors.

25:27.589 --> 25:29.023
We know what to look for.

25:29.024 --> 25:31.826
Esta bien.

25:33.195 --> 25:36.564
Profesionales.

25:36.565 --> 25:41.002
So your prison stay may have
caused endocrine problems.

25:41.003 --> 25:43.471
I'm sure there are vitamin and
other nutritional deficiencies.

25:43.472 --> 25:45.506
- We should do a workup.
- I agree.

25:45.507 --> 25:48.810
But a standard workup
is not what I need first.

25:51.280 --> 25:54.782
So five weeks LMP?

25:54.783 --> 25:56.484
Mm-hmm.

25:56.485 --> 26:00.555
There's the gestational sac.

26:00.556 --> 26:02.824
Yeah, everything
looks good to me.

26:02.825 --> 26:05.860
Ay, bendito dios.

26:05.861 --> 26:08.796
I haven't exactly been taking
my prenatal vitamins.

26:10.699 --> 26:14.569
Well, now I see
why Boris was so anxious.

26:14.570 --> 26:17.805
Uh, actually...

26:17.806 --> 26:20.074
I assume this exam is protected

26:20.075 --> 26:22.009
by the doctor-patient
privilege.

26:23.745 --> 26:26.581
Boris doesn't know
he's gonna be a father.

26:33.722 --> 26:37.525
So the good news is, you passed
the stress test yesterday.

26:37.526 --> 26:39.327
Well, that's wonderful.

26:39.328 --> 26:42.063
Yeah, but your
total cholesterol is 200.

26:42.064 --> 26:43.097
That's high?

26:43.098 --> 26:44.565
Yeah, higher
than it should be.

26:44.566 --> 26:46.467
- So what does that mean?
- One of two things.

26:46.468 --> 26:48.636
Either you modify your diet
and start to exercise,

26:48.637 --> 26:50.605
or I put you
on cholesterol medication.

26:50.606 --> 26:53.007
- Can I think about it?
- Wrong answer.

26:53.008 --> 26:54.308
Also, Hank, would it help

26:54.309 --> 26:56.944
if he avoided stressful
situations from now on?

26:56.945 --> 26:58.980
Yeah, sure, it would.
Yeah.

26:58.981 --> 27:00.314
Stressful situations?

27:00.315 --> 27:02.516
Kind of like the one
I saw you in the other night.

27:02.517 --> 27:03.985
Remember?

27:03.986 --> 27:06.420
With some dude in a hat.

27:06.421 --> 27:09.090
That was an investor
who backed out.

27:09.091 --> 27:12.059
He backed out
in a deserted parking lot?

27:12.060 --> 27:14.929
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:14.930 --> 27:16.898
Are you following me?

27:16.899 --> 27:18.933
Uh, Evan doesn't particularly
care for that term.

27:18.934 --> 27:20.334
I don't believe this.

27:20.335 --> 27:22.470
Dad, Dad, spare us
the moral outrage, okay?

27:22.471 --> 27:25.406
Yeah. Can you just...
just tell us who he is.

27:25.407 --> 27:27.341
Well, I-I was trying
to protect you

27:27.342 --> 27:28.643
from knowing all this,

27:28.644 --> 27:31.178
but I guess that ship
has sailed.

27:31.179 --> 27:33.781
Knowing all of what?

27:33.782 --> 27:36.284
About the money
that I invested for you.

27:36.285 --> 27:39.153
The money you stole from us.

27:39.154 --> 27:41.422
Look, I wanted to pay you
both back

27:41.423 --> 27:43.291
as soon as I got here
to the Hamptons.

27:43.292 --> 27:45.826
I just don't have
that kind of cash on hand.

27:45.827 --> 27:46.827
Okay.

27:46.828 --> 27:48.396
So make a long story short,

27:48.397 --> 27:51.465
I'm in debt
to some unappealing characters,

27:51.466 --> 27:53.401
who want to be paid back now.

27:53.402 --> 27:56.103
What did you get
yourself into, Dad?

27:56.104 --> 27:59.807
I just didn't
want to let you both down.

27:59.808 --> 28:01.976
So you thought we cared
about having the money,

28:01.977 --> 28:03.844
but not the truth?

28:03.845 --> 28:07.415
Hank, Evan, look at me, please.

28:09.985 --> 28:12.520
I am so sorry.

28:12.521 --> 28:14.755
I really, really am.

28:14.756 --> 28:17.325
These people...

28:17.326 --> 28:19.093
Would they hurt you?

28:19.094 --> 28:23.130
Sex on the beach?

28:26.268 --> 28:27.401
Am I interrupting something?

28:27.402 --> 28:29.603
No, no, no,
just your Shmoopy here

28:29.604 --> 28:30.638
has to lay off the booze

28:30.639 --> 28:32.206
until his triglycerides
come down.

28:32.207 --> 28:34.842
Oh, of course. Eddie, come
with me into the kitchen.

28:34.843 --> 28:36.944
I'll make you a virgin.

28:41.283 --> 28:43.951
I'm beginning to think
that you were right all along.

28:43.952 --> 28:45.019
How so?

28:45.020 --> 28:47.288
I just heard
his side of the story.

28:47.289 --> 28:49.991
I have no idea
whether to believe him or not.

28:49.992 --> 28:52.293
No, actually...

28:52.294 --> 28:54.295
This time felt different.

28:54.296 --> 28:56.330
How so?

28:56.331 --> 28:57.999
I don't know.
He came clean, you know.

28:58.000 --> 29:02.003
He knew we wouldn't like it,
but he told us anyway.

29:02.004 --> 29:04.605
This is coming
from the guy who swore

29:04.606 --> 29:06.207
he would never forgive him.

29:06.208 --> 29:09.477
This isn't about forgiving him.

29:09.478 --> 29:12.346
It's about accepting him.

29:19.905 --> 29:21.539
How's my ADD been today?

29:21.540 --> 29:23.574
Manageable, yeah.

29:23.575 --> 29:24.909
What's your secret?

29:24.910 --> 29:27.478
We finally talked
to my Dad last night.

29:27.479 --> 29:29.981
- How'd it go?
- Good.

29:29.982 --> 29:32.116
He was honest.
It's a start.

29:32.117 --> 29:34.885
Yeah, I'm just hoping
if he needs help with something,

29:34.886 --> 29:37.388
he trusts us enough
to ask for it.

29:39.691 --> 29:42.893
And I hope you...

29:42.894 --> 29:44.695
would trust me enough.

29:44.696 --> 29:46.630
What is that?

29:46.631 --> 29:48.132
Open it.

29:52.838 --> 29:55.773
It's a check.

29:58.076 --> 30:00.311
Even if we were
splitting this bill,

30:00.312 --> 30:01.846
this would be
more than your half.

30:01.847 --> 30:03.514
If we were buying
the country club,

30:03.515 --> 30:04.815
this would be
more than your half.

30:04.816 --> 30:06.050
What the hell is this?

30:06.051 --> 30:09.220
I want to invest in Bluesky.

30:09.221 --> 30:11.355
I believe in Bluesky.

30:11.356 --> 30:13.491
Go Bluesky!

30:15.927 --> 30:19.530
I want to solve your problem
by solving your Dad's problem.

30:19.531 --> 30:23.567
Paige.

30:23.568 --> 30:25.669
This isn't one of those problems
that can be solved

30:25.670 --> 30:27.772
by throwing money at it.

30:29.174 --> 30:30.975
Plus, I don't want
our relationship

30:30.976 --> 30:33.944
to be a series
of financial transactions.

30:33.945 --> 30:36.514
My Dad will be fine,

30:36.515 --> 30:38.883
but thank you.

30:41.987 --> 30:44.955
Well, should we just buy
the country club, then?

30:44.956 --> 30:48.059
I love the fact that I can't
tell if you're kidding or not.

30:51.129 --> 30:54.231
Some hanging out
with my Dad later.

30:54.232 --> 30:55.900
You want to join us?

31:00.705 --> 31:04.341
AJ hasn't called back
to confirm her appointment.

31:04.342 --> 31:05.709
Really?

31:05.710 --> 31:08.579
Something is not adding up
with this woman.

31:08.580 --> 31:10.181
Maybe she's just feeling better.

31:10.182 --> 31:12.383
Maybe she's gotten
over her crush.

31:12.384 --> 31:14.018
She doesn't have a crush on me.

31:14.019 --> 31:17.121
I'm inclined to
agree with Hank on that.

31:17.122 --> 31:20.524
Hi, Dieter.

31:20.525 --> 31:22.726
Bye, Dieter.

31:24.029 --> 31:25.896
What is it?

31:25.897 --> 31:27.298
It's Boris...

31:27.299 --> 31:30.167
requesting the pleasure
of our company, 6:00 PM.

31:30.168 --> 31:31.702
That's all it says.

31:31.703 --> 31:33.504
Did you say "our"?

31:33.505 --> 31:35.372
Yes, but he also said
"pleasure."

31:35.373 --> 31:36.841
How odd.

31:36.842 --> 31:38.742
It is addressed to us both.

31:38.743 --> 31:40.711
A dinner party
at the manor house?

31:40.712 --> 31:43.114
I've just been called up
to the Majors, baby.

31:43.115 --> 31:44.615
It doesn't say dinner party.

31:44.616 --> 31:46.617
- What's the occasion?
- It doesn't say.

31:46.618 --> 31:47.818
Well, of course
it's a dinner party.

31:47.819 --> 31:50.254
What else would it be,
a swap meet?

31:50.255 --> 31:53.124
- What's the dress code?
- It's... black tie.

31:53.125 --> 31:54.725
Black tie.
Of course it's black tie.

31:54.726 --> 31:56.160
That was a stupid question.
It's Boris.

31:56.161 --> 31:58.229
Um, okay, so three-piece
or cummerbund?

31:58.230 --> 31:59.597
No, cummerbund
is too old-school.

31:59.598 --> 32:01.732
I'm gonna have to, uh...

32:07.405 --> 32:09.874
Hey, is everything okay?

32:09.875 --> 32:13.277
Yeah.

32:13.278 --> 32:15.813
I-it's just...

32:15.814 --> 32:18.149
When Adam went into v-tach,

32:18.150 --> 32:21.085
I got pretty upset.

32:21.086 --> 32:23.554
Well, that can be
a scary thing to see.

32:23.555 --> 32:27.791
But you handled it
like a pro, as always.

32:27.792 --> 32:29.860
Mm.

32:35.200 --> 32:37.601
Wow, Paige!
Holy crap.

32:37.602 --> 32:39.737
That... that was a great shot.

32:39.738 --> 32:41.272
I'm telling you, Eddie,

32:41.273 --> 32:43.574
turn your stance a little
to the left of the fairway

32:43.575 --> 32:45.075
when you tee off.

32:45.076 --> 32:47.912
You'll conquer your slice,
just like I conquered mine.

32:47.913 --> 32:49.680
Ow.

32:53.051 --> 32:55.252
I really like her, Evan.

32:55.253 --> 32:57.288
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

32:57.289 --> 33:00.124
Me too.

33:00.125 --> 33:02.593
We have to do this
more often, all of us.

33:02.594 --> 33:03.894
Sorry it could
only be nine today.

33:03.895 --> 33:04.929
That's all right.

33:04.930 --> 33:07.264
What, do you
have plans with Paige?

33:07.265 --> 33:09.767
Plans with Boris,
6:00 PM sharp.

33:11.036 --> 33:12.970
Wow. I thought
he was out of town.

33:12.971 --> 33:15.306
No, he's back,
and he summoned me.

33:20.645 --> 33:22.913
So you think AJ
will actually donate?

33:22.914 --> 33:24.915
When I saw her
at the hospital yesterday,

33:24.916 --> 33:28.185
she seemed sincere about giving
money to the clinic.

33:28.186 --> 33:31.055
But I'm surprised she wasn't
on any of my target donor lists.

33:31.056 --> 33:32.823
She must be new
to the Hamptons.

33:32.824 --> 33:34.959
No, she said she's been
coming out here for years,

33:34.960 --> 33:37.061
since she inherited
that house from her Dad.

33:37.062 --> 33:38.229
Really?

33:38.230 --> 33:40.164
That's weird.

33:40.165 --> 33:41.799
It is weird.

33:41.800 --> 33:45.836
Anyway, she sure seemed
interested in you.

33:45.837 --> 33:47.571
You sound like Divya.

33:47.572 --> 33:49.240
She wouldn't stop
asking about you.

33:49.241 --> 33:51.041
She's a yenta-mouth.

33:51.042 --> 33:53.010
- Ha ha!
- Wow, okay.

33:53.011 --> 33:55.079
I love that word.

33:55.080 --> 33:56.313
Technically, it's two words...

33:56.314 --> 33:58.716
"yenta," "mouth"...
but who's counting?

33:58.717 --> 34:00.284
Well, not AJ.

34:00.285 --> 34:03.587
She's too busy
falling all over you.

34:03.588 --> 34:05.222
I miss this,

34:05.223 --> 34:07.191
just hanging out together,
you and me.

34:07.192 --> 34:09.293
And this time,
I really do mean it.

34:09.293 --> 34:10.360
Jill.

34:10.362 --> 34:11.695
I know. I'm sorry.

34:11.696 --> 34:12.896
I know you're seeing Emily.
I just...

34:12.897 --> 34:14.665
No, no, no,
I think AJ inherited

34:14.666 --> 34:16.266
more than just
a house from her Dad.

34:16.268 --> 34:18.636
I think she has
a fainting disorder

34:18.637 --> 34:20.871
called familial vasovagal syncope.

34:20.871 --> 34:23.373
So when she sprained her ankle,
she didn't just trip...

34:23.375 --> 34:25.409
- She started to faint.
- Yeah.

34:25.409 --> 34:26.844
Well, my car's right
out front... let's go.

34:26.844 --> 34:27.945
Okay.

34:48.233 --> 34:50.266
You're over this place already?

34:50.268 --> 34:51.969
We'll be back for Christmas.

34:51.969 --> 34:53.704
The kids love the pool.

34:53.705 --> 34:55.572
Mm.

34:58.810 --> 35:00.778
Well, your numbers look great.

35:00.779 --> 35:04.214
I can't take all the credit.

35:04.215 --> 35:08.452
Well, Hank will follow up
in two days.

35:08.453 --> 35:09.653
Hank?

35:09.654 --> 35:11.255
You're staffing me out?

35:11.256 --> 35:13.891
Hardly.
He's my boss.

35:13.892 --> 35:17.361
I'd prefer continuity
of care.

35:18.863 --> 35:21.432
But, um...

35:21.433 --> 35:24.435
Thank you for saving my life.

35:27.706 --> 35:29.406
You are welcome.

36:13.385 --> 36:15.386
No one locks their doors
in the Hamptons.

36:32.520 --> 36:34.616
Yeah, I understand... Ok... Hum ...

36:34.620 --> 36:37.206
Thanks John, I really appeciated it.
I'll talk to you soon.

36:41.600 --> 36:42.925
All right...

36:46.000 --> 36:47.579
I'm ready.

36:47.600 --> 36:48.346
For Boris or for prom?

36:49.281 --> 36:50.281
Fashion is vocabulary of Kings.

36:51.300 --> 36:53.900
Then tou are wearing some very big words.

36:54.200 --> 36:55.747
Thank you. Who was at the phone?

36:55.800 --> 36:57.429
Ha... Joe's friend, John Nical

36:57.907 --> 37:00.709
He says it's too soon to file a missing person report on AJ,

37:00.710 --> 37:01.910
so he's looking into it.

37:01.911 --> 37:04.246
Hey, boys.

37:04.247 --> 37:05.414
Hey, Dad.

37:05.415 --> 37:07.549
What are you doing here?

37:07.550 --> 37:10.619
I was wondering if you
wouldn't mind if I tagged along

37:10.620 --> 37:12.421
for your meeting with Boris.

37:12.422 --> 37:14.089
Oh, I really don't think
that's wise.

37:14.090 --> 37:15.591
Dad, why would you
want to come?

37:15.592 --> 37:17.192
To pitch him Bluesky.

37:17.193 --> 37:18.527
He's done enough for us.

37:18.528 --> 37:20.362
Let's not get greedy, okay?
Maybe down the road.

37:20.363 --> 37:22.664
- Why not just go to Newberg?
- No, I care for her.

37:22.665 --> 37:24.500
I don't want our relationship

37:24.501 --> 37:27.236
to be a series
of financial transactions.

37:30.106 --> 37:32.107
All right, look,
you boys don't understand.

37:32.108 --> 37:33.542
I really need this.

37:33.543 --> 37:35.544
Boris could be the answer
to all my problems.

37:35.545 --> 37:36.945
He could be the big whale

37:36.946 --> 37:38.714
that drives the wolves
from my doorstep.

37:38.715 --> 37:41.717
I'm asking.
I need this. Please.

37:41.718 --> 37:44.186
Just give us one second,
one second.

37:44.187 --> 37:47.222
No.

37:47.223 --> 37:49.458
Though I'm confused
by his mixing

37:49.459 --> 37:51.493
of surf-and-turf metaphors,

37:51.494 --> 37:53.428
I'm... I'm sympathetic
to his plight.

37:53.429 --> 37:54.930
I am.

37:54.931 --> 37:57.299
When we first got out here,
we were in a very similar rut.

37:57.300 --> 37:59.067
Yeah, and Boris
helped us out of it.

37:59.068 --> 38:00.702
And maybe he could help Dad
out of his.

38:00.703 --> 38:03.705
Yeah, or maybe he'd resent us
taking advantage.

38:03.706 --> 38:05.173
That's a risk
I'm willing to take,

38:05.174 --> 38:07.676
and I've been fantasizing about
this meeting all day, Henry.

38:07.677 --> 38:09.378
Dad needs our help, right?

38:09.379 --> 38:12.414
He's... he's trusting us enough
to actually ask for it.

38:14.684 --> 38:16.385
Fine.

38:16.386 --> 38:19.454
Okay, I will, uh, call
and see if it's okay.

38:22.225 --> 38:25.327
Thank you, Evan.

38:30.600 --> 38:33.569
Wow.

38:33.570 --> 38:37.673
You're not as surprised
as I was.

38:37.674 --> 38:40.742
I still can't believe
that it happened.

38:40.743 --> 38:43.478
It was just a kiss, Divya.

38:46.349 --> 38:48.684
It wasn't just a kiss.

38:48.685 --> 38:54.256
It was that connection
that Raj and I have never had.

38:54.257 --> 38:56.858
But that's not Raj's fault.

38:56.859 --> 38:59.461
And he didn't deserve
what I just did.

39:03.633 --> 39:06.301
What you did took strength.

39:06.302 --> 39:09.838
What I did showed weakness.

39:09.839 --> 39:15.177
I guess it just depends
on what you decide to do next.

39:15.178 --> 39:20.148
I have no idea whatsoever
what's next.

39:20.149 --> 39:24.953
Well, when you look in front
of you, who do you see?

39:24.954 --> 39:27.990
Well, that's a loaded question.

39:27.991 --> 39:31.259
We're staring straight
at London.

39:36.666 --> 39:39.768
So Boris was just cool with it?

39:39.769 --> 39:42.004
He said he could think
of nothing more appropriate

39:42.005 --> 39:44.539
than the whole
family attending.

39:45.875 --> 39:47.442
Thank you for coming,
gentlemen.

39:47.443 --> 39:48.677
Thank you for having us.

39:48.678 --> 39:51.813
Yeah, all of us.

39:51.814 --> 39:53.248
Thank you.

39:53.249 --> 39:58.286
Boris, I know that we got off
to a rocky start.

39:58.287 --> 39:59.721
Let me tell you why I'm here.

39:59.722 --> 40:02.357
I believe I know exactly
why you're here, Mr. Lawson,

40:02.358 --> 40:04.559
and I assure you,
you'll have your, uh...

40:04.560 --> 40:06.528
day in court.

40:06.529 --> 40:10.065
But allow me to initiate.
Please.

40:10.066 --> 40:13.201
Gentlemen, it's come to my attention

40:13.202 --> 40:17.205
that your father
is a criminal...

40:17.206 --> 40:19.041
and a liar.

40:22.245 --> 40:24.880
As a result of various
financial schemes,

40:24.881 --> 40:26.314
he recently attracted
the attention

40:26.315 --> 40:28.450
of the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

40:28.451 --> 40:30.752
He was prosecuted
and convicted.

40:30.753 --> 40:35.223
In an attempt
to win a reduced sentence,

40:35.224 --> 40:38.527
he became
a Confidential Informant...

40:38.528 --> 40:41.430
against me.

40:44.300 --> 40:46.868
Spying on my affairs,

40:46.869 --> 40:49.571
my travels...

40:49.572 --> 40:52.641
my home...

40:52.642 --> 40:54.810
Stealing my personal possessions

40:54.811 --> 40:57.312
and delivering them
to his handler.

41:00.149 --> 41:01.516
That's who that dude was.

41:01.517 --> 41:03.785
That Du... that guy
was a Federal Agent?

41:06.556 --> 41:08.023
To ensure he acted alone

41:08.024 --> 41:10.358
and not with the help of his
two sons living on my property,

41:10.359 --> 41:13.962
I conducted
my own investigation.

41:20.503 --> 41:24.239
Thank you.

41:26.342 --> 41:29.044
Thank you, Catherine.

41:29.045 --> 41:34.449
According to the evidence
that has been accumulated...

41:34.450 --> 41:37.085
it appears that you two
have nothing to explain.

41:37.086 --> 41:38.687
Hmm.

41:38.688 --> 41:40.789
But now, Mr. Lawson,
as promised,

41:40.790 --> 41:43.859
you have the floor.

41:46.062 --> 41:49.164
What is it you wanted
to say exactly?

41:49.165 --> 41:52.167
Hmm?

41:52.168 --> 41:53.668
Dad?

41:57.507 --> 42:00.475
I can't breathe.

42:08.718 --> 42:10.786
Is it anxiety again?

42:10.787 --> 42:14.456
Actually, I think he's having
a heart attack. Call 911.
