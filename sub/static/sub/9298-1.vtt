00:01.083 --> 00:04.719
<i>And it's the annual Boston Police
Department salute to heroes tonight.</i>

00:04.885 --> 00:07.664
<i>Boston homicide detective
Jane Rizzoli,</i>

00:07.830 --> 00:10.427
<i>who was badly injured in a siege
at headquarters three months ago,</i>

00:10.593 --> 00:11.680
<i>will be honored,</i>

00:11.805 --> 00:14.598
<i>along with army private Abby Sherman,
just 22 years old.</i>

00:15.060 --> 00:17.267
<i>Sherman's story made headlines
when her platoon</i>

00:17.433 --> 00:19.269
<i>was ambushed in Afghanistan.</i>

00:19.435 --> 00:23.065
<i>She was shot but crawled to a machine gun
to save three members of her squad.</i>

00:33.282 --> 00:34.618
Turn him on his side!

00:34.784 --> 00:37.496
- What's happening?
- His lung is filling up with blood.

00:40.600 --> 00:43.694
"Detective Jane Rizzoli
was the youngest officer

00:43.819 --> 00:46.305
"to ever be promoted

00:47.096 --> 00:48.697
"to the rank of detective."

00:52.969 --> 00:53.970
Go!

01:07.567 --> 01:09.405
Shoot him!
Just shoot him!

01:23.122 --> 01:25.252
- You look terrible.
- Thank you.

01:25.418 --> 01:27.003
You're making everyone late.

01:27.468 --> 01:30.144
Even you would look bad
if a bullet had gone through you.

01:31.812 --> 01:34.173
Laceration to your peritoneum
and small bowel

01:34.298 --> 01:36.012
could explain your jaundiced color.

01:36.178 --> 01:38.547
You may not casually
discuss my privates.

01:38.672 --> 01:39.797
Three months.

01:40.308 --> 01:43.437
You could have read all of Shakespeare.
Learned Finnish?

01:44.046 --> 01:47.649
Instead, you've become a platinum member
of the shopping channel.

01:48.115 --> 01:50.777
I swear to God, if you start cleaning,
I will kick you out.

01:50.943 --> 01:53.572
- Is that why you banned your mother?
- Is that what she said?

01:54.429 --> 01:58.285
Did she mention all of her OCD banging
and clanking around isn't restful?

01:58.868 --> 02:01.079
What, Finnish?
Like, Finland Finnish?

02:01.245 --> 02:03.415
You know, the stress hormone cortisol

02:03.581 --> 02:06.960
suppresses your immune cells' ability
to activate telomerase.

02:07.126 --> 02:08.586
So you say. Mine are fine.

02:08.752 --> 02:11.381
Quite simply,
keeping your brain busy aids recovery.

02:11.506 --> 02:12.549
Mind, body...

02:12.715 --> 02:15.135
- Mind business.
- You are my business.

02:15.301 --> 02:16.931
Come on. Give me that.
Here we go.

02:17.728 --> 02:19.473
Stop.
Maura, I'm not going.

02:19.639 --> 02:21.183
What?
You still have pain?

02:21.349 --> 02:22.893
I just like saying "ow".

02:23.836 --> 02:27.031
Could be from intermittent obstruction
due to adhesions.

02:27.156 --> 02:29.299
When was your last bowel movement?

02:30.438 --> 02:32.398
You just can't help yourself,
can you?

02:33.062 --> 02:34.343
I think you're avoiding.

02:35.669 --> 02:36.990
What is that?

02:37.913 --> 02:40.487
It's a get-well present
from Korsak and Frost.

02:40.998 --> 02:44.331
That's restful?
Where is your uniform?

02:46.952 --> 02:48.502
It is disgusting in here!

02:52.314 --> 02:53.485
Put this on.

02:54.525 --> 02:55.842
Makes me look like a man.

02:56.008 --> 02:58.512
We can do this the easy way
or the hard way.

02:58.678 --> 03:01.765
I'm not a hero, Maura.
Shooting yourself is not heroic.

03:01.931 --> 03:03.809
The people of Boston think it is.

03:03.975 --> 03:06.137
Eight people died.
I don't want a medal for that.

03:06.262 --> 03:08.855
- Five of them were bad guys, Jane.
- Whatever.

03:09.398 --> 03:12.751
This ceremony isn't for you.

03:14.535 --> 03:17.364
This is for your fellow officers

03:17.530 --> 03:20.394
and your parents and your community.

03:21.251 --> 03:22.285
You're a symbol.

03:22.451 --> 03:25.264
You are a heroic
flesh-and-blood reminder

03:25.389 --> 03:26.915
of the thin blue line.

03:27.609 --> 03:28.625
That's good.

03:29.875 --> 03:31.325
You almost had me.

03:34.707 --> 03:36.049
The hard way.

03:53.149 --> 03:56.403
Season 2 Episode 1
<i>We Don't Need Another Hero</i>

03:56.569 --> 03:59.489
Boston PD and the US military
honoring their own tonight.

04:02.744 --> 04:06.162
Private first class Abby Sherman's
support squad was headed to a rendezvous

04:06.328 --> 04:09.369
with my platoon
to rearm and resupply us,

04:09.494 --> 04:11.334
when her truck was hit by an RPG.

04:12.413 --> 04:13.545
She was shot,

04:13.711 --> 04:15.442
she crawled to a saw,

04:15.567 --> 04:19.170
firing round after round
at Taliban militia.

04:20.341 --> 04:21.894
Because of her courage,

04:22.782 --> 04:24.723
these three men are alive today.

04:30.216 --> 04:32.981
- Congratulations.
- See? That's a hero.

04:33.957 --> 04:35.275
Detective Jane Rizzoli

04:35.441 --> 04:38.236
was the first female officer
to work in the drug-control unit.

04:38.402 --> 04:42.407
She was also the youngest officer ever
to be promoted to the rank of detective.

04:48.827 --> 04:50.999
<i>I knew she had more balls
than any guy on the job.</i>

04:51.165 --> 04:53.185
Ladies and gentlemen,
detective Jane Rizzoli.

04:58.622 --> 04:59.925
Say something uplifting.

05:07.343 --> 05:08.558
Can you hand it to me?

05:08.724 --> 05:11.436
Stand still, Rizzoli,
or I'll pin it on your forehead.

05:14.986 --> 05:16.449
Say a few words.

05:22.773 --> 05:25.450
Guys,
I didn't really prepare anything.

05:27.868 --> 05:28.920
Just 'cause...

05:30.283 --> 05:32.916
I don't really think of myself
as a hero.

05:37.698 --> 05:41.579
Most of you,
you know my little brother, Frankie.

05:43.634 --> 05:45.428
Just stand up and help me out.

05:55.580 --> 05:58.233
Frankie is alive
because of Dr. Maura Isles.

05:59.086 --> 06:00.860
She normally works on dead people.

06:02.559 --> 06:05.359
He's alive because of her,
not because of me.

06:09.577 --> 06:11.641
I was just doing my job.

06:15.416 --> 06:17.419
We all do this job because it's...

06:19.962 --> 06:21.659
it's what we've been trained to do.

06:21.784 --> 06:26.192
We've been trained
not to think of ourselves but to act,

06:27.135 --> 06:28.136
Because...

06:30.836 --> 06:32.494
life is unfair...

06:34.901 --> 06:37.063
and bad things happen, and...

06:37.949 --> 06:39.315
I think that we're here...

06:39.481 --> 06:40.798
We're all here...

06:41.901 --> 06:44.138
to remind everybody that...

06:45.098 --> 06:46.924
sometimes the good guys still win.

06:47.049 --> 06:48.228
Thank you very much.

07:02.571 --> 07:04.049
Where's my dad?

07:08.202 --> 07:09.012
Casey?

07:13.832 --> 07:16.102
How are you?
What are you doing here?

07:16.268 --> 07:19.172
You don't come to the school reunions.
Wanted to see how you turned out.

07:19.338 --> 07:21.338
You came from Afghanistan
to see that?

07:21.504 --> 07:24.069
Everyone on leave got an invite.
Thought it'd be fun to see you.

07:25.154 --> 07:26.179
You look great.

07:26.304 --> 07:28.709
Lieutenant colonel, delta force.

07:28.834 --> 07:30.283
That's impressive.

07:32.948 --> 07:34.750
You know what?
I want to talk to you.

07:34.875 --> 07:37.196
- Can you give me a sec?
- Sure.

07:37.362 --> 07:38.606
It's good to see you.

07:40.408 --> 07:41.586
That was a good speech.

07:41.752 --> 07:44.148
- I didn't see dad. Where is he?
- I don't know.

07:46.134 --> 07:47.425
I'm so proud of you.

07:47.591 --> 07:48.731
Thanks, ma.

07:50.327 --> 07:51.471
Where's daddy?

07:56.475 --> 07:57.706
What is the matter?

07:58.028 --> 07:58.937
Ma, okay.

07:59.103 --> 08:00.480
Sit down, ma.

08:04.275 --> 08:05.360
I need a pen.

08:05.526 --> 08:07.222
- What's wrong?
- I need a pen!

08:07.572 --> 08:09.665
She gets very emotional
and then she can't talk,

08:09.790 --> 08:11.272
we have her write it down.

08:11.952 --> 08:14.536
Hang on.
Here, here. Write it down.

08:19.209 --> 08:20.041
"Divorce."

08:20.761 --> 08:22.293
Detective, congratulations.

08:22.459 --> 08:24.161
Can you do a quick interview with us?

08:24.286 --> 08:25.630
How it feels to be a hero?

08:26.564 --> 08:28.007
- Fantastic.
- Great.

08:28.173 --> 08:29.926
Could you give me a second?
Please.

08:30.092 --> 08:31.469
- Sure.
- Thank you.

08:31.635 --> 08:35.085
You know, she gets
very emotional when she's proud.

08:36.328 --> 08:38.977
Ma, it's gonna be okay,
it's gonna be okay.

08:39.523 --> 08:40.895
Let Frankie take you home.

08:41.501 --> 08:42.503
What?

08:43.355 --> 08:45.372
"We are getting divorced."

08:45.827 --> 08:46.934
That's terrible.

08:47.942 --> 08:49.243
This should come out.

08:51.802 --> 08:52.991
Oh, God.

08:53.157 --> 08:54.844
You were in Mogadishu, sir?

08:55.326 --> 08:57.498
Haiti in '94, Yugoslavia in '99.

08:57.963 --> 08:59.126
You're back.

09:00.324 --> 09:01.961
I loved your speech.

09:02.086 --> 09:04.377
I loved your heroism.
It puts me to shame.

09:05.655 --> 09:06.876
Nice talking to you, sir.

09:07.001 --> 09:09.326
- Let me get you guys a drink.
- Nothing for me, thanks.

09:09.752 --> 09:12.260
Doctor says water or prune juice.

09:12.967 --> 09:13.898
Sexy.

09:16.281 --> 09:17.932
We dated in high school.

09:19.793 --> 09:22.437
See Gary?
We enlisted together.

09:23.008 --> 09:24.272
You came back together.

09:24.438 --> 09:26.228
War isn't good for a relationship.

09:26.846 --> 09:27.734
I'm sorry.

09:28.211 --> 09:29.777
We're still friends.

09:31.504 --> 09:34.908
Do they resent you?
I mean, the other detectives.

09:36.037 --> 09:37.076
It's that bad?

09:37.242 --> 09:39.537
Got a lot worse
after all this hero BS.

09:41.705 --> 09:43.335
They hurt, don't they?

09:44.668 --> 09:46.317
I can still feel the bullet.

09:46.442 --> 09:47.837
The doctors left it there.

09:48.615 --> 09:50.261
I wish scars looked good on girls.

09:50.386 --> 09:54.010
There's something good about ugly scars.
You can't pretend it didn't happen.

09:54.745 --> 09:56.143
Are you gonna go back?

09:56.913 --> 09:59.015
I've been asking myself that
a lot lately.

09:59.181 --> 10:00.182
I'm done.

10:00.682 --> 10:02.182
I did my last tour.

10:02.562 --> 10:04.145
I'm a civilian after tonight.

10:12.903 --> 10:15.103
- You take care, okay?
- You too.

10:17.563 --> 10:18.785
Fresh out of prune juice.

10:21.689 --> 10:24.749
Slucky.
Can the night get any worse?

10:24.915 --> 10:25.719
Thanks.

10:25.844 --> 10:28.086
Except for you.
This is my trauma surgeon.

10:28.460 --> 10:30.922
Luckily, I was under
when we hung out together.

10:31.556 --> 10:34.676
Everything is the royal "we".
Serious. Watch.

10:36.234 --> 10:37.660
How are we feeling, Jane?

10:38.356 --> 10:40.690
We are feeling fine,

10:41.283 --> 10:43.810
but we can't speak for everyone.

10:45.436 --> 10:49.795
All the single guys in Boston
and you got to date ucky slucky?

10:49.920 --> 10:51.650
Don't refer to Byron that way.

10:51.775 --> 10:52.986
It's unethical, Maura.

10:53.152 --> 10:55.363
Why?
He was your doctor, not mine.

10:58.327 --> 10:59.683
I mean, he's very sexy.

11:00.109 --> 11:02.370
He has an odd accent, though.

11:02.536 --> 11:05.331
He moved here from England
when he was a kid.

11:06.341 --> 11:08.173
I nearly lost my virginity to him.

11:08.298 --> 11:10.442
Byron is much better
when he's not talking, Jane.

11:10.567 --> 11:12.171
I think you would really like him.

11:12.337 --> 11:13.324
I like Byron...

11:13.449 --> 11:14.788
when I'm anesthetized.

11:14.913 --> 11:16.718
Your turtle has a better
bedside manner.

11:16.884 --> 11:18.011
Tortoise.

11:18.450 --> 11:19.926
And I don't disagree with you,

11:20.051 --> 11:23.347
Which is why it was a wonderful surprise
to find out that he was very tender

11:23.472 --> 11:26.102
when he wasn't by the bed,
but in the bed.

11:27.608 --> 11:30.339
That's like thinking
about my parents having sex.

11:32.313 --> 11:33.776
My parents are getting a divorce.

11:34.502 --> 11:35.503
I know.

11:36.747 --> 11:37.956
I'm so sorry.

11:39.189 --> 11:41.409
This is just too much crap.

11:41.826 --> 11:44.954
I need to learn how to compartmentalize.
How do men do it?

11:46.179 --> 11:49.346
They simply separate everything
into isolated compartments.

11:51.553 --> 11:53.754
Thank you.
That's very helpful.

11:53.879 --> 11:56.967
Please,
go have tender sex with Byron,

11:57.092 --> 11:58.585
and I'm going home.

11:58.751 --> 12:01.031
You do need to boost
your immune system,

12:01.156 --> 12:02.555
and sex is very good for that.

12:03.692 --> 12:04.913
Thank you, doctor.

12:08.413 --> 12:09.784
I was married for a while.

12:09.909 --> 12:12.135
She was a west pointer, too.
It didn't work out.

12:12.260 --> 12:13.942
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

12:14.437 --> 12:16.486
So, how come we never finished
what we started?

12:17.344 --> 12:20.223
Because you didn't give me
the time of day until senior week.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.140
I was a jerk.

12:22.695 --> 12:24.896
You were just too cool for me.

12:25.021 --> 12:26.106
And smart.

12:26.231 --> 12:27.232
Truth?

12:28.211 --> 12:29.624
You were too scary for me.

12:30.273 --> 12:31.292
Gee, thanks.

12:31.458 --> 12:33.753
I looked cool,
but I was like 12 in boy years.

12:34.123 --> 12:36.506
You were a force even then.
Smart, beautiful.

12:36.672 --> 12:38.764
Didn't care
what anybody thought of you.

12:40.699 --> 12:42.011
Inside, I was a geek.

12:58.676 --> 12:59.677
Come on!

13:00.220 --> 13:01.245
Come on.

13:02.258 --> 13:04.409
- There might be a second bomb.
- We need to help her.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.014
She's gone. Come on.

13:06.396 --> 13:08.121
Get the bomb squad out here!

13:08.287 --> 13:09.414
Move back!

13:11.248 --> 13:13.497
- Secure the building!
- I'll get the soldiers to help!

13:14.418 --> 13:16.256
- Jane, are you okay?
- Keep everyone back!

13:18.415 --> 13:20.606
- I want a perimeter now!
- Back it up!

13:20.731 --> 13:22.760
- I got this.
- Got her?

13:24.970 --> 13:26.973
Private first class Sherman
was in that car!

13:27.139 --> 13:28.483
Was she by herself?

13:29.600 --> 13:31.978
Rizzoli, need you out of here.
You're not cleared for duty.

13:32.144 --> 13:35.523
Dr. Isles, we're gonna need you.
Frankie! Get her home!

13:35.689 --> 13:37.191
Don't need no more casualties.

13:37.357 --> 13:39.777
- I want to help. I want to help.
- You all right? Come on.

13:41.065 --> 13:42.029
Get out of here!

13:42.195 --> 13:44.370
- Vince, be careful.
- I can't get in it!

13:46.120 --> 13:48.744
I can't believe it.
Abby died right in front of me.

13:48.910 --> 13:49.960
I can stay.

13:50.085 --> 13:51.698
- I'm okay.
- All right.

13:51.823 --> 13:53.883
And they're gonna want
all hands on deck.

13:54.349 --> 13:57.670
- I make sure you're okay before I go.
- You gonna watch me brush my teeth?

14:01.191 --> 14:02.425
He left a message.

14:03.299 --> 14:05.720
"Honey, sorry I can't be there...
Dad."

14:06.532 --> 14:07.914
That's not like him.

14:08.985 --> 14:13.050
Or did I also suffer brain damage
and forget what terrible kids we were?

14:13.175 --> 14:15.938
- What?
- Janie, he moved out today.

14:16.275 --> 14:19.025
- What? How do you know?
- She told me.

14:24.400 --> 14:25.615
Did you see this coming?

14:26.680 --> 14:28.765
I guess it's been coming
for a long time.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.706
They were fighting a lot
at the hospital.

14:33.872 --> 14:36.792
- We both almost died.
- Even that didn't bring them together.

14:37.217 --> 14:38.818
But to move out?

14:39.360 --> 14:41.839
- Why so fast?
- They're losing the house.

14:42.297 --> 14:43.090
What?

14:43.379 --> 14:46.594
Yeah, ma said that they've been
living off a second mortgage.

14:48.596 --> 14:49.898
House is for sale.

14:52.662 --> 14:54.228
Man, I have been out of it.

15:00.314 --> 15:01.315
Go.

15:02.008 --> 15:05.196
You want be a detective. They're gonna
want everybody looking for bomb parts.

15:05.362 --> 15:06.500
All right.

15:06.666 --> 15:07.994
I'm gonna go to sleep.

15:08.658 --> 15:10.326
I just want to forget about today.

15:12.134 --> 15:14.413
Just promise me you'll stay put?

15:16.453 --> 15:17.454
Come on.

15:18.318 --> 15:19.319
There.

15:20.863 --> 15:22.072
It's gonna be okay.

15:29.166 --> 15:30.566
Detective Rizzoli.

15:30.939 --> 15:32.150
You're new.

15:32.275 --> 15:33.724
Yeah, I'm...

15:33.890 --> 15:34.976
Officer Reynolds.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.311
It's a pleasure to meet you, really.

15:37.477 --> 15:39.657
I can't let you in without a badge.
Sorry.

15:40.186 --> 15:42.445
Come on, I got...
There's my badge.

15:42.570 --> 15:44.610
- We got a tough case to solve.
- No, I can't.

15:45.408 --> 15:47.238
Security's been really tight since...

15:48.564 --> 15:50.658
- Since me.
- What are you doing here?

15:50.824 --> 15:52.868
I'm trying to figure out
who killed Abby Sherman.

15:53.034 --> 15:56.414
- We haven't cleared you yet.
- Are you sure you're ready for this?

15:56.580 --> 15:58.583
I'm sure
that I'm done sitting on my ass.

15:59.833 --> 16:00.834
Here.

16:01.611 --> 16:02.837
Clear me for active duty.

16:03.003 --> 16:05.965
Call Darlene in my office,
make an appointment.

16:08.929 --> 16:10.230
See you later.

16:11.082 --> 16:13.806
He's so tender. I don't know
how I never noticed. Get me in there.

16:14.294 --> 16:16.841
Jane, go home.
Get better.

16:16.966 --> 16:20.730
Maura, you heard me. This is who I am.
This I what I do. Now, get me in there.

16:24.238 --> 16:25.109
Okay, fine.

16:25.851 --> 16:27.903
But I'm only doing this
because I'm afraid

16:28.069 --> 16:30.504
that you're gonna hurt yourself
or this nice officer.

16:30.629 --> 16:33.701
- It's okay. Detective Rizzoli's with me.
- Yes, ma'am.

16:39.152 --> 16:39.957
Really?

16:42.626 --> 16:43.894
Downstairs only.

16:44.019 --> 16:47.221
I will poke you in your scar tissue
if you even touch the "up" arrow.

17:03.068 --> 17:05.316
That's a sign of sexual frustration.

17:07.098 --> 17:08.711
Or tangled hair.

17:10.185 --> 17:13.215
I can't stop seeing Abby's face.
It looks different in here.

17:13.340 --> 17:15.159
That is correct, Rip Van Winkle.

17:15.759 --> 17:18.412
And wait till you see my office.
The decorator just finished.

17:18.578 --> 17:21.224
Oh, my God, I'm so excited,
I might need a paper bag.

17:22.998 --> 17:26.585
It's possible it's taking you longer
to heal because of your attitude.

17:26.710 --> 17:30.449
A. 40-caliber bullet went through me.
My attitude isn't faking that.

17:30.574 --> 17:32.361
You're not faking anything.

17:32.486 --> 17:34.250
You had a life-threatening injury.

17:34.723 --> 17:36.555
But you're strong, healthy.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.719
Something's gotten
in the way of your healing.

17:40.468 --> 17:42.061
Will you please stop doing that?

17:42.227 --> 17:44.063
I wish I knew
what was causing that pain.

17:44.538 --> 17:47.588
Again, I'm going
with the .40-caliber bullet, but...

17:49.943 --> 17:53.085
Are you sure you want to be here?
She was very badly burned.

17:59.327 --> 18:00.686
Are those her dog tags?

18:02.458 --> 18:06.085
She survives two tours in Afghanistan
and gets blown up at home.

18:06.466 --> 18:07.467
Thank you.

18:24.144 --> 18:25.980
I can't.
I can't, I can't.

18:33.987 --> 18:37.286
What the hell is wrong with me?
I've been through worse than this.

18:37.411 --> 18:39.141
And Abby deserves better.

18:39.266 --> 18:40.891
Jane, take a deep breath.

18:41.016 --> 18:42.467
No, I can't. It hurts.

18:43.733 --> 18:45.507
What if I'm never who I was.

18:46.186 --> 18:48.043
That's the human condition.

18:49.031 --> 18:50.032
Thanks.

18:50.701 --> 18:51.901
Really upbeat.

18:54.266 --> 18:56.887
This hurts, too.
How uncomfortable is this?

18:57.012 --> 19:00.131
How can you say that.
That's a Karim Rashid label.

19:00.778 --> 19:03.112
In that case, it's like...

19:03.872 --> 19:06.052
the warm caress of a mother's hand.

19:07.307 --> 19:09.506
Your parasympathetic nerve
is in overdrive.

19:09.631 --> 19:10.983
It's a protective mechanism.

19:11.149 --> 19:14.361
What, because I don't like your office?
Did taxpayers pay for this?

19:14.527 --> 19:15.654
Of course not.

19:16.698 --> 19:18.392
You might still be in physical pain

19:18.517 --> 19:22.531
because of a posttraumatic reaction
to what's happened to you.

19:22.656 --> 19:23.996
Make it stop.

19:27.380 --> 19:29.210
What do you do
when fear is killing you?

19:30.559 --> 19:34.298
It's very hard to die from fear unless
you have a congenital heart condition.

19:36.137 --> 19:37.218
What can I do?

19:37.384 --> 19:38.613
Get me upstairs.

20:07.062 --> 20:09.374
Rizzoli, what the hell?
I gave you an order.

20:09.540 --> 20:12.336
I know. I'm sorry.
Please reinstate me.

20:12.832 --> 20:15.494
- Okay, just for this case.
- You know the routine.

20:15.619 --> 20:17.800
You get your doctor to sign off,
and then I sign off.

20:17.966 --> 20:19.978
You're still paying me, Lieutenant.
All right?

20:20.607 --> 20:22.596
I want to help.
I want to do this for Abby. Please.

20:23.359 --> 20:26.101
You can stick around, but you're off
the books until I get a signed release.

20:26.226 --> 20:28.477
- No gun, no badge.
- Understood. Thank you.

20:30.028 --> 20:31.438
Great to have you back.

20:33.032 --> 20:36.068
Say hello to your new sergeant.
You're a threesome now.

20:36.234 --> 20:39.321
- You okay over here? You see, we moved.
- You do this?

20:41.405 --> 20:42.783
I did, I did.

20:43.490 --> 20:45.299
- Welcome back, Jane.
- Thank you.

20:45.978 --> 20:48.414
- How you doing with him being sergeant?
- I got a choice?

20:48.751 --> 20:50.734
Okay, let's get to it.
Bring me up to speed.

20:50.859 --> 20:52.657
Our bomb squad and the FBI
are still there.

20:52.782 --> 20:55.880
We helped them do a line search.
Found the explosives casing.

20:56.046 --> 20:58.841
Homeland security's sending over a team.
I just talked to the governor.

20:59.007 --> 21:01.051
- Was it terrorists?
- That's the speculation.

21:01.953 --> 21:03.637
Anything to suggest
it was home grown?

21:03.803 --> 21:07.224
Looks like common components.
Bomb techs found large-diameter pipe.

21:07.390 --> 21:10.269
It was a pipe bomb.
She got any family here in Boston?

21:10.435 --> 21:13.606
Only child. She's been in the army
for four years. We're digging, though.

21:13.772 --> 21:16.400
She was discharged two weeks ago.
She was staying with her mom.

21:16.566 --> 21:17.943
Oh, God. Was her mother there?

21:23.223 --> 21:24.481
What about personal?

21:24.606 --> 21:26.452
Abby said the men in her platoon
resented her.

21:26.618 --> 21:27.745
No way.

21:27.911 --> 21:30.547
With all due respect, there weren't
women serving hen you were a marine.

21:30.946 --> 21:33.167
I ever treat you any different
from Frost, Rizzoli?

21:35.126 --> 21:37.046
You never bought me flowers.

21:37.389 --> 21:39.298
Detective Frost,
turn up the volume, please.

21:40.707 --> 21:41.884
<i>And our top story...</i>

21:42.009 --> 21:45.419
<i>A car explosion has taken
the life of a young female US soldier.</i>

21:46.179 --> 21:48.355
<i>The question now,
is this a terrorist attack?</i>

21:48.480 --> 21:52.102
Let's investigate her military history.
Find out who she was stationed with.

21:52.268 --> 21:54.610
See if she got any disciplinary reports
from MPs, anything.

21:54.735 --> 21:56.705
You met lieutenant colonel Jones.

21:56.830 --> 21:59.568
He's army special ops.
He's got a stake in this.

21:59.734 --> 22:00.778
Get him in here.

22:03.780 --> 22:06.075
Why hasn't some group
claimed responsibility?

22:06.241 --> 22:08.285
Terrorists
are the first to get the credit.

22:08.451 --> 22:10.788
She's been in Afghanistan for four years.
What about her unit?

22:10.954 --> 22:13.032
Maybe somebody she was stationed with
wanted her dead.

22:13.157 --> 22:14.583
There's no way it's a fragging.

22:14.749 --> 22:17.514
I'm not saying it is, but we have to
at least consider the possibility

22:17.639 --> 22:19.129
that it could be a fellow soldier.

22:20.157 --> 22:22.675
If it's a soldier, the army wants to know.
I want to know.

22:23.201 --> 22:25.344
That looks like part of a switch.

22:25.696 --> 22:27.429
Yeah. It's a Mercury switch.

22:27.595 --> 22:30.224
You have a list of the chemical
components in the explosives yet?

22:30.390 --> 22:31.684
Yeah, right here.

22:33.893 --> 22:38.065
Traces of powdered aluminum, magnesium,
potassium chlorate, and sulfur.

22:38.231 --> 22:40.807
No trace of octol,
which is only used by us.

22:41.233 --> 22:42.277
It's not a soldier.

22:42.801 --> 22:46.281
I don't want it to be a soldier either,
but we can't rule that out.

22:46.447 --> 22:49.199
So, how many from her squad were
in Boston when she was killed?

22:49.659 --> 22:51.138
Only the three guys that survived,

22:51.263 --> 22:54.248
plus her platoon leader,
Lieutenant Forman.

22:54.414 --> 22:55.665
Let's go talk to them.

22:57.834 --> 22:58.956
Give me a sec.

23:02.114 --> 23:03.278
Scar tissue.

23:03.403 --> 23:05.805
Formed around a foreign object
in Abby's shoulder.

23:06.531 --> 23:09.513
That must be the bullet.
Abby said they left it in.

23:10.388 --> 23:12.382
Why wouldn't army doctors
take it out?

23:12.507 --> 23:15.123
Could have been too close
to the brachial plexus, maybe.

23:15.248 --> 23:16.937
- I'll process it.
- Let me know?

23:21.401 --> 23:23.360
Abby said you were
high-school sweethearts.

23:26.123 --> 23:27.531
Stayed best friends.

23:27.886 --> 23:29.292
And you were with her...

23:29.417 --> 23:30.617
The whole way.

23:31.534 --> 23:33.460
Abby was driving
the deuce and a half.

23:34.634 --> 23:36.123
I was riding shotgun.

23:36.753 --> 23:40.406
Orders were to meet up,
resupply ammo and parts.

23:40.531 --> 23:43.456
Heard the sound of an RPG
as it was being launched,

23:43.917 --> 23:45.115
then boom.

23:45.967 --> 23:48.132
Flips that 21/2-ton truck...

23:49.272 --> 23:50.965
like it's a kid's toy.

23:52.196 --> 23:54.063
Killed Smith and Lewis instantly.

23:54.764 --> 23:56.669
Insurgents are firing at us.

23:57.332 --> 23:58.931
I'm pinned in the truck.

23:59.056 --> 24:00.425
I can't get to the saw.

24:01.467 --> 24:02.699
We're all dead men.

24:03.160 --> 24:04.526
Private Sherman is hit.

24:05.159 --> 24:06.737
But she makes it to the saw,

24:07.808 --> 24:10.783
lays down covering fire.

24:14.868 --> 24:16.342
She saved all of them.

24:17.247 --> 24:18.380
She was support.

24:19.451 --> 24:21.335
Wasn't supposed to be
anywhere near combat.

24:21.766 --> 24:23.378
Guys teased her because...

24:24.553 --> 24:25.935
she was kind of girly.

24:27.041 --> 24:28.300
I knew she was tough.

24:29.926 --> 24:32.221
Did you do any more
than just resupply runs with her?

24:35.932 --> 24:36.892
No, that day...

24:38.309 --> 24:39.422
When it counted...

24:40.447 --> 24:42.211
She lived up to my highest ideal.

24:42.336 --> 24:44.358
She was a soldier.
That's what she was.

24:46.503 --> 24:47.504
She was...

24:49.382 --> 24:51.052
a damn fine soldier.

24:57.627 --> 24:58.831
I'm sorry for the mess.

25:00.725 --> 25:02.459
I don't mind.
I've been living in a tent.

25:02.751 --> 25:04.628
Aren't you supposed
to be drinking prune juice?

25:04.794 --> 25:06.184
Not after this.

25:07.289 --> 25:10.407
I keep thinking about what Abby said
about her squad resented her.

25:10.532 --> 25:12.427
Did you pick that up
from any of them?

25:14.035 --> 25:16.346
Those were soldiers
mourning one of their own.

25:16.998 --> 25:18.308
It's got to be terrorism.

25:19.220 --> 25:23.105
That's why I'm over there,
to keep it from happening over here.

25:23.742 --> 25:26.233
We have the best bomb guys
in the country working on it.

25:26.399 --> 25:27.461
We'll get them.

25:28.878 --> 25:31.308
- Want to know something crazy?
- Lay it on me.

25:32.065 --> 25:34.161
I was thinking,
except for the girly part...

25:36.190 --> 25:37.411
Abby was like you.

25:38.528 --> 25:39.564
I'm honored.

25:40.996 --> 25:43.414
Except for the girly part.

25:43.967 --> 25:45.210
I can be girly.

25:47.408 --> 25:49.181
I always liked your toughness.

25:49.930 --> 25:52.092
You're asoft-shelled crab, Rizzoli.

25:53.120 --> 25:54.720
A not-girly-crab.

25:55.988 --> 25:59.516
You really need to work
on your pickup lines.

26:00.041 --> 26:02.561
Hard on the outside,
soft on the inside.

26:04.683 --> 26:06.690
That's why you're such
an incredible cop.

26:07.008 --> 26:09.109
Because you care so damn much.

26:10.141 --> 26:11.373
Maybe too much.

26:14.906 --> 26:16.543
You can't care too much.

26:40.750 --> 26:43.768
30 years, I've been picking up
that man's socks,

26:44.228 --> 26:47.983
cooking without spices
because it gave him indigestion.

26:52.613 --> 26:54.321
Hey, Mrs. Rizzoli.

26:55.457 --> 26:56.907
Hello, Charles.

27:05.440 --> 27:06.583
Come on, ma!

27:07.064 --> 27:09.544
Just for once in my life,
could you please knock?

27:18.588 --> 27:20.721
So, too sick to wash the dishes,

27:20.846 --> 27:22.557
but not too sick to have intercourse?

27:22.723 --> 27:25.948
Intercourse, ma? Come on.
We didn't sleep together.

27:26.073 --> 27:28.816
Okay, yes, we slept...
Why am I having this conversation?

27:28.941 --> 27:32.359
I gave you a key
for emergencies only.

27:32.525 --> 27:34.027
It was an emergency.

27:34.193 --> 27:36.405
The health department
was gonna condemn the place.

27:36.954 --> 27:38.463
I made you breakfast.

27:39.730 --> 27:40.575
Thank you.

27:43.576 --> 27:45.580
I heard you were selling the house.

27:45.746 --> 27:48.458
- Thanks to your father.
- Ma, I'm so sorry.

27:49.045 --> 27:50.294
What happened?

27:54.505 --> 27:55.631
He left me.

27:58.222 --> 27:59.788
He left me with nothing.

28:00.399 --> 28:03.432
I gave him my best years.

28:03.598 --> 28:06.268
Okay, come on.
You have plenty of good years left.

28:06.434 --> 28:07.435
All right?

28:07.801 --> 28:11.648
And you got me, you got Frankie,
you got Tommy.

28:11.814 --> 28:13.191
Tommy who's in prison?

28:13.357 --> 28:14.993
He's getting out soon, ma.

28:15.695 --> 28:18.905
He's been writing me letters.
He's doing really good.

28:21.637 --> 28:23.410
Why didn't daddy
come to the ceremony?

28:23.576 --> 28:26.663
I asked him not to, because I didn't
want you to have to arrest me if he did.

28:26.829 --> 28:27.914
Why? What did he do?

28:31.960 --> 28:33.712
He wants a change.

28:34.712 --> 28:36.262
I want a change, too.

28:36.706 --> 28:39.217
But you don't see me
walking out on him.

28:41.128 --> 28:44.473
You can stay here as long as you like.
You can have my bedroom.

28:44.639 --> 28:46.641
Not gonna impose.
I can't.

28:46.981 --> 28:48.518
You wouldn't be imposing.

28:49.330 --> 28:50.678
That's very nice of you.

28:51.875 --> 28:52.898
Thank you.

28:53.753 --> 28:57.922
But Dr. Isles offered me
her guest house.

28:59.291 --> 29:00.113
What?

29:01.169 --> 29:02.532
I'm a good guest.

29:03.616 --> 29:05.109
Are you a masochist?

29:05.234 --> 29:07.621
You bought this house
for your mother to visit, not mine.

29:07.787 --> 29:10.470
Increased blood flow.
Rush of endorphins.

29:10.595 --> 29:13.085
- You feel less pain today, don't you?
- What are you talking about?

29:13.442 --> 29:16.213
- You had sex.
- We did not have... We almost had...

29:16.672 --> 29:18.144
It's really none of your business,

29:18.269 --> 29:20.801
but feel free to chat about it
with my mother at your slumber parties.

29:20.967 --> 29:22.969
I never really got much sleep
at slumber parties.

29:23.973 --> 29:25.847
Why? Why are you doing this?

29:26.013 --> 29:28.809
- Because she's your family.
- I feel guilty.

29:29.173 --> 29:30.268
Catholic guilt.

29:30.434 --> 29:32.725
Did you know
that a university of Parma study

29:32.850 --> 29:36.274
found that devout Catholics
are more likely to show signs of OCD?

29:36.957 --> 29:39.388
Mart Luther's strict definition
of the sacraments

29:39.513 --> 29:40.779
is too constraining.

29:41.417 --> 29:42.531
I hated confession.

29:43.006 --> 29:44.616
Did you have a lot to confess to?

29:44.782 --> 29:46.118
I made stuff up.

29:46.284 --> 29:49.371
Because if you confess to sins that
you're not sorry for, then that's a sin.

29:49.537 --> 29:51.373
Isn't making up sins a sin?

29:52.748 --> 29:54.545
How are we this morning?

29:55.261 --> 29:57.295
I called Darlene in your office.

29:57.461 --> 30:00.215
She said you were too busy
to squeeze me in.

30:00.381 --> 30:01.925
We are rather busy.

30:02.091 --> 30:04.469
And so are you.
I'll be waiting outside.

30:04.635 --> 30:06.594
I'd like to discuss
your pathology findings.

30:07.847 --> 30:09.704
- Morning.
- Vomit.

30:11.684 --> 30:12.987
I'm worried about her.

30:13.112 --> 30:15.105
She still has pain.
Shouldn't she be healed?

30:15.830 --> 30:19.045
- Patients heal at different rates.
- But you don't know her.

30:19.170 --> 30:20.652
She had a dislocated shoulder

30:20.818 --> 30:24.049
and she still tackled
a 200-pound suspect to the ground.

30:24.174 --> 30:26.032
Are we questioning my opinion?

30:27.521 --> 30:29.161
There could be another component.

30:29.652 --> 30:30.996
The mind is powerful.

30:31.162 --> 30:34.249
- She had a trauma.
- You're merely a pathologist.

30:34.415 --> 30:38.086
And she had expert care
from a renowned trauma surgeon.

30:39.565 --> 30:41.673
Are you talking about yourself
in the third person?

30:41.839 --> 30:43.925
- Are we angry?
- We are.

30:44.091 --> 30:47.064
Thank you for reminding me
why I don't date surgeons.

30:52.183 --> 30:54.674
That's what was inside the scar tissue
in Abby's shoulder.

30:55.394 --> 30:56.701
.38-caliber bullet...

30:57.426 --> 30:58.940
from an American revolver.

31:00.363 --> 31:01.966
No, friendly fire.

31:02.091 --> 31:03.653
Don't you think it has to be?

31:03.819 --> 31:05.780
Can you get inside
of her medical records?

31:06.796 --> 31:08.638
What can you tell us
about her gunshot wound?

31:08.763 --> 31:10.788
That would just be my opinion.

31:10.913 --> 31:13.747
Pretend I'm a priest
and I can't tell anyone.

31:13.913 --> 31:15.040
I'm not catholic.

31:17.983 --> 31:19.298
It is my opinion

31:19.722 --> 31:21.963
that she was facing her shooter
when she was shot

31:22.129 --> 31:23.798
from no more than 6 feet away.

31:24.416 --> 31:27.010
It's based on the scarring
around the entrance wound.

31:27.176 --> 31:28.720
So she would have seen her shooter.

31:28.886 --> 31:31.264
Can't be.
Can't. Why would she lie?

31:31.430 --> 31:33.769
She says right here:
"I was shot by a Taliban insurgent."

31:33.894 --> 31:35.101
Nothing's been redacted.

31:35.576 --> 31:39.105
I'm not saying there's some big cover-up
by the department of evil.

31:39.271 --> 31:40.075
All right?

31:40.200 --> 31:42.651
I'm a cop.
I'm practically a soldier myself.

31:42.817 --> 31:46.780
Look at this. It says that Abby refused
to let them remove the bullet.

31:46.946 --> 31:50.283
Maybe because she didn't want them
finding an American soldier's bullet.

31:50.449 --> 31:51.955
This is all speculation.

31:52.080 --> 31:53.620
Casey, she lied.

31:53.786 --> 31:54.729
Why?

31:54.854 --> 31:57.290
Maybe she was afraid.

31:57.456 --> 31:58.347
Of what?

31:58.472 --> 32:01.211
Soldiers know... Everybody knows...
It's war.

32:02.380 --> 32:05.549
Friendly fire happens. It's tragic.
But when it does, we admit it.

32:06.659 --> 32:08.635
Tell that to Pat Tillman's family.

32:11.772 --> 32:13.476
I said I'd help you, and I will.

32:14.248 --> 32:15.376
Not like this.

32:22.505 --> 32:23.775
That was awkward.

32:23.941 --> 32:24.985
You think?

32:35.173 --> 32:36.663
What are you doing?

32:37.199 --> 32:39.861
I want to talk to Gary, the private
that was with her when she was shot.

32:39.986 --> 32:41.759
They were high-school sweethearts.

32:43.085 --> 32:44.490
Hi, private Campbell?

32:45.607 --> 32:47.090
This is detective Rizzoli.

32:49.372 --> 32:52.429
I have a few more questions for you.
I was just wondering...

32:54.654 --> 32:56.224
Today would be fantastic.

32:57.062 --> 32:58.329
Perfect. Right now.

32:59.361 --> 33:00.547
All right, thanks.

33:01.503 --> 33:03.607
You're not cleared for active duty.
I'm going with you.

33:04.370 --> 33:05.878
You're not a detective.

33:06.328 --> 33:08.528
Technically, neither are you.

33:11.717 --> 33:13.783
I'd like that folder back.

33:16.922 --> 33:17.912
Private Campbell?

33:24.335 --> 33:25.635
Maura, you okay?

33:26.170 --> 33:28.082
I don't think
this is just about Abby.

33:30.616 --> 33:32.057
You were damn lucky.

33:32.182 --> 33:33.511
Glad you're okay.

33:34.209 --> 33:37.432
Every soldier who knows the truth about
what happened to Abby is in danger.

33:37.598 --> 33:38.600
What do you mean?

33:39.206 --> 33:41.383
Abby was shot by a friendly
in Afghanistan.

33:44.504 --> 33:45.357
You knew?

33:47.107 --> 33:48.568
Are you part of a cover-up?

33:50.100 --> 33:52.173
- I was following orders.
- Whose orders?

33:53.364 --> 33:54.908
Lieutenant Forman's.

33:55.074 --> 33:57.902
Forman was special operations group.
He can carry anything he wants.

33:58.027 --> 33:59.720
Including a .38 revolver.

34:01.831 --> 34:04.751
- I'm next, aren't I?
- Not if we can help it.

34:08.036 --> 34:10.757
Look at his record. It's outstanding.
There's no way it's him.

34:10.922 --> 34:13.927
Abby was outstanding, too,
except she was enlisted, not an officer.

34:14.092 --> 34:14.969
Sorry.

34:15.094 --> 34:17.007
I tracked powdered sulfur
from the bombings

34:17.132 --> 34:18.889
back to a chemical-supply store.

34:19.335 --> 34:20.766
Look who signed the receipt.

34:20.933 --> 34:23.937
Forman's due back at Fort Braggin
North Carolina in five days.

34:24.103 --> 34:26.208
He rented a house in Boston
two weeks ago.

34:26.333 --> 34:27.982
Got a signed lease.

34:28.621 --> 34:30.230
Right when Abby was discharged.

34:30.355 --> 34:32.237
Forman was in combat
for the first time, right?

34:32.402 --> 34:33.737
Maybe he panics, shoots Abby.

34:33.904 --> 34:37.158
Then she turns out to be a hero, but
as her commander, he can keep her quiet.

34:37.324 --> 34:40.161
But then she applies for a discharge.
Maybe he follows her here.

34:40.327 --> 34:43.052
Afraid she'll talk,
or maybe one of her squad will.

34:44.060 --> 34:47.043
He started killing the soldiers
he led into battle to save his career?

34:47.208 --> 34:50.295
Got another explanation for purchasing
this much stuff to make bombs?

34:50.462 --> 34:52.065
We got to get to that house.

34:52.190 --> 34:54.214
I'll get on the hook,
get SWAT to meet us out there.

34:54.339 --> 34:56.928
I'll drag the entry team out of bed.
You're welcome to come.

35:00.386 --> 35:02.392
Stay here, Jane.
Stay safe.

35:02.558 --> 35:03.979
We'll have a live feed.

35:09.940 --> 35:12.610
<i>Tango leader.
Squad one in position.</i>

35:12.776 --> 35:14.904
<i>Tango leader to squad two,
confirm position.</i>

35:15.070 --> 35:16.862
I'm like a boxer with a glass jaw.

35:16.987 --> 35:19.422
Have you ever seen me
not able to step up?

35:20.332 --> 35:23.204
The most powerful force of nature
is not a nuclear weapon.

35:23.370 --> 35:24.838
When I talk, do you hear:

35:24.963 --> 35:27.417
"Blah, blah, blah, Maura,
blah, blah, blah"?

35:27.583 --> 35:29.076
It's thoughts.

35:29.201 --> 35:31.127
That's the most powerful force...
Your thoughts.

35:31.252 --> 35:33.028
Job used to take
my mind off of everything.

35:33.153 --> 35:35.398
It's like I'm not who I am anymore.

35:36.091 --> 35:39.179
Just do me a favor, all right?
Close your eyes.

35:40.763 --> 35:42.766
Close them.
Take a deep breath.

35:44.183 --> 35:45.974
- I can't.
- <i>Tango two, go to full position.</i>

35:46.099 --> 35:47.812
<i>Tango one, on my command.</i>

35:52.171 --> 35:53.485
Trip wire! Everybody out!

35:53.807 --> 35:55.528
<i>Fall back, fall back!
Move, move!</i>

36:05.320 --> 36:06.865
Fricking tragedy all around.

36:06.990 --> 36:08.928
Blew himself up
before we could get there.

36:09.411 --> 36:11.294
At least he didn't take
anybody else with him.

36:11.806 --> 36:14.987
I'm gonna tell private Campbell myself.
He should know this is over.

36:15.534 --> 36:17.941
I'll tag along for moral support.

36:29.370 --> 36:30.833
Compression fracture.

36:40.805 --> 36:42.947
Why was he wearing Abby's dog tags?

36:48.809 --> 36:50.792
Forman, Sherman.

36:50.958 --> 36:52.378
She was wearing his.

36:57.572 --> 36:59.467
So, Lieutenant Forman killed Abby.

37:01.755 --> 37:03.304
That's just hard to believe.

37:06.557 --> 37:07.684
Excuse me.

37:11.729 --> 37:13.780
Forman was killed by a blow
to the back of the head

37:13.905 --> 37:15.275
before the explosion.

37:15.690 --> 37:16.819
You sure?

37:17.568 --> 37:18.903
He was dead before the blast.

37:19.069 --> 37:20.803
So, he was framed by the killer.

37:21.240 --> 37:23.693
<i>Lieutenant Forman
and Abby Sherman were lovers.</i>

37:26.342 --> 37:28.204
- Crap.
- Jane, what is it?

37:29.872 --> 37:31.404
Thank you, Gary.

37:31.970 --> 37:33.126
<i>It's Gary.</i>

37:33.292 --> 37:34.836
I'm calling for backup!

37:35.753 --> 37:36.963
Thanks.

37:37.129 --> 37:39.507
It's too bad
you know your guns, detective.

37:39.673 --> 37:41.050
Bit of a gun enthusiast.

37:48.431 --> 37:50.560
- You shot Abby.
- It was an accident.

37:51.552 --> 37:53.244
I didn't know it was her...

37:54.613 --> 37:56.691
- I heard movement.
- And you pulled the trigger.

37:57.402 --> 37:59.944
- She covered it up to protect you.
- I loved her.

38:00.110 --> 38:02.906
What did you blow her up for?
She wasn't gonna expose you.

38:03.072 --> 38:04.073
Because...

38:04.740 --> 38:06.826
Because
"war isn't good for relationships."

38:08.202 --> 38:09.969
This was never about the war.

38:10.094 --> 38:12.874
This was about Lieutenant Forman.
That's why he's dead, too.

38:13.040 --> 38:14.792
They thought I didn't know?

38:14.958 --> 38:17.211
They were fraternizing!
That's right.

38:18.337 --> 38:21.633
He was her superior officer.
That's a court-martial offense.

38:21.799 --> 38:23.635
It wasn't an accident in Afghanistan.

38:24.810 --> 38:26.054
You tried to kill Abby.

38:26.220 --> 38:29.265
They thought that they'll get out
of the army and live happily ever after?

38:30.971 --> 38:32.268
No, wait.

38:32.740 --> 38:33.741
Wait.

38:34.144 --> 38:35.629
Just wait a minute, all right?

38:38.301 --> 38:39.943
And that's why
he leased a house here.

38:40.420 --> 38:41.860
To be closer to her.

38:43.028 --> 38:44.280
I get it.

38:45.114 --> 38:47.075
I get that.
You don't have to do this.

38:47.241 --> 38:48.743
I got no choice.

38:48.909 --> 38:51.204
You have a choice.
Just face what you've done.

39:03.368 --> 39:04.300
Give it to me.

39:05.603 --> 39:06.777
That's all right.

39:08.792 --> 39:09.840
That's okay.

39:23.539 --> 39:24.771
"You're my hero."

39:25.186 --> 39:25.989
Mine, too.

39:28.407 --> 39:30.149
I know why we never got together.

39:31.175 --> 39:32.286
You still scare me...

39:33.731 --> 39:35.136
As much as this thing.

39:36.340 --> 39:37.440
I scare you?

39:41.948 --> 39:43.256
I got to say goodbye.

39:43.808 --> 39:45.591
Why? Where you going?

39:45.757 --> 39:46.957
My leave's up.

39:49.210 --> 39:50.805
I've loved seeing you.

39:56.649 --> 39:57.985
I loved seeing you.

39:59.988 --> 40:02.844
Show up at the next reunion.
We'll finish what we started.

40:09.338 --> 40:10.339
Doctor.

40:17.039 --> 40:20.668
Heroes are actually social deviants.
The Zimbardo experiment proved that.

40:20.834 --> 40:22.587
He's going back to Afghanistan.

40:26.546 --> 40:27.675
I'm sorry.

40:29.967 --> 40:31.167
No, it's good.

40:33.433 --> 40:35.668
I was so scared, Maura,
and I did it anyway.

40:37.372 --> 40:39.270
That's the definition of a hero.

40:39.928 --> 40:41.481
Who's a social deviant.

40:42.553 --> 40:44.609
It's not a bad thing.

40:44.983 --> 40:47.570
Right, so, I'm a not-girly,

40:48.588 --> 40:50.098
crabby social deviant.

40:50.223 --> 40:51.157
That's great.

40:55.791 --> 40:56.931
Can I just...

40:58.037 --> 40:59.315
Take a deep breath.

41:01.238 --> 41:02.239
Any pain?

41:05.462 --> 41:07.443
- I'm back. I'm back!
- You're back.

41:08.715 --> 41:10.927
I was pretty sure
that it was psychosomatic.

41:11.093 --> 41:13.571
- It was so not psychosomatic.
- No, I think it was.

41:13.696 --> 41:15.762
You think?
So, you were guessing?

41:16.635 --> 41:19.792
I can think.
I can consider, I can conclude.

41:19.917 --> 41:22.286
- That's guessing. You guessed.
- No, I did not.

41:22.411 --> 41:25.325
<i>Dr. Isles guessed, Dr. Isles guessed</i>

41:25.450 --> 41:26.451
I did not.

41:29.534 --> 41:30.947
- I did not.
- Did too.
