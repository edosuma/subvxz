<i>Welcome back to a very special
Tool Time live from my house.</i>

00:07.073 --> 00:10.907
lt's Christmas, time to think
about cleaning out that chimney.

00:11.678 --> 00:13.771
Cheerio, Timothy.

00:17.717 --> 00:19.844
Frosted Flakes to you, Al.

00:21.187 --> 00:25.123
Well, Tim is right. A dirty chimney can
cause smoke to back up into your house.

00:25.191 --> 00:28.354
Or worse yet,
creosote can build up and cause a fire.

00:28.461 --> 00:30.019
lf you don't use your fireplace,

00:30.130 --> 00:32.564
there might be animals making nests.
Check that out.

00:32.631 --> 00:34.691
Right. You don't wanna
light up your Yule log

00:34.768 --> 00:37.100
and end up barbecuing a possum.

00:38.905 --> 00:41.999
Not unless you're Jed Clampett.

00:42.075 --> 00:44.009
He's a millionaire, you know.

00:45.078 --> 00:48.104
Well, [sighs]
l shall just head up to the roof.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:57.524 --> 01:00.391
l'll just be down here
collecting the soot, Al.

01:00.460 --> 01:02.985
There's two things to tell
about cleaning a chimney.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.360
<i>[phone rings]</i>

01:04.431 --> 01:06.126
Whose job was it to unplug the phone?

01:08.902 --> 01:11.063
- Would somebody answer that?
- l'll get it.

01:11.171 --> 01:12.468
Thank you.

01:12.539 --> 01:15.838
OK, there's two things l'm gonna
tell you about cleaning out a chimney.

01:15.909 --> 01:19.538
lt's Grandma. She wants to know whether
we're coming up Saturday or Sunday.

01:24.517 --> 01:26.951
Tell her Saturday.

01:27.020 --> 01:29.545
There's two things
about cleaning out your chimney.

01:29.622 --> 01:31.249
What time on Saturday?

01:34.260 --> 01:35.989
Eight o'clock.

01:36.062 --> 01:41.193
Don't you hate when your mom calls you
and you're working on a live TV show?

01:41.267 --> 01:44.361
- There's two things...
- Should she make breakfast for us?

01:44.437 --> 01:48.134
[sighs] Mom, do you know
l'm working on a live TV show here?

01:48.208 --> 01:51.974
- Yeah, and she says your fly's undone.
- What?

01:55.281 --> 01:57.249
Grandma says, ''Got ya.''

02:48.067 --> 02:49.796
So, Wilson, what are you doing?

02:49.869 --> 02:53.805
[Wilson] Well, Tim, l'm carving
a nativity scene out of giant radishes.

02:56.142 --> 02:58.508
What do you think
of my Three Wise Men?

03:00.480 --> 03:02.812
l think they
should come bearing onion dip.

03:02.882 --> 03:03.849
[Wilson chuckles]

03:03.950 --> 03:07.113
See, this is part of the Mexican custom
of Noche de Rabanos.

03:07.187 --> 03:10.953
Um... Night of the Bathroom?

03:12.425 --> 03:14.893
No, no, no, no, no, Tim.
Night of the Radishes.

03:14.961 --> 03:18.897
You see, every Christmas,
farming families would head into town

03:18.965 --> 03:21.525
and display their tuberous creations.

03:21.601 --> 03:24.570
Which reminds me, l guess you're
going to be heading out of town

03:24.637 --> 03:26.195
to help your mother move.

03:26.272 --> 03:31.005
Yep. Tomorrow morning, 5 am.
Jill and the boys and Marty's coming,

03:31.077 --> 03:32.942
and my brother Jes
going to meet us.

03:33.012 --> 03:35.378
Jeff. He's the one who's parsimonious?

03:35.481 --> 03:37.745
No, he's Presbyterian.

03:40.253 --> 03:42.414
No, l mean parsimonious as in frugal.

03:42.488 --> 03:47.425
[scoffs] Frugal's not the word for Jeff.
This guy recycles his dental floss.

03:48.328 --> 03:51.263
Closing up the old childhood home
can be a traumatic thing.

03:51.331 --> 03:53.959
- l know it was for me.
- A lot of memories?

03:54.033 --> 03:56.092
Yeah, they're still vivid.

03:56.169 --> 03:59.468
Waking up to the sound
of a hyena laughing.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.403
The sweet smell of hay
as the zebra grazed.

04:03.476 --> 04:07.537
The sight of a mother rhinoceros
feeding her calf.

04:08.615 --> 04:10.981
Uh, you... you were raised in Africa?

04:11.050 --> 04:13.314
Chicago.

04:13.386 --> 04:16.253
ln an apartment overlooking the zoo.

04:16.322 --> 04:20.190
Well, it's gonna be weird
moving her out of that house.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.558
Moving her here
is gonna allow me to do something

04:22.629 --> 04:25.598
- l've always wanted to do.
- Spend more time with her?

04:25.665 --> 04:29.795
No, drive a really big truck. [grunts]

04:31.571 --> 04:33.334
[passing car horn blaring]

04:33.439 --> 04:35.498
Boy, l love this truck!

04:35.575 --> 04:37.543
[horn blares]

04:37.644 --> 04:40.306
Stop that!

04:40.380 --> 04:44.441
This is just great. Five-speed tranny,
five-ton big Detroit diesel.

04:44.517 --> 04:47.611
This is gonna be
the greatest day of my life. [grunts]

04:47.687 --> 04:49.587
Tim, you are driving too fast.

04:49.656 --> 04:52.989
lf l were alone, this could
be the greatest day of my life.

04:55.028 --> 04:58.361
[sighs] God, l hate moving.

04:58.431 --> 05:00.956
Do you know how many times
l moved when l was a kid?

05:01.034 --> 05:03.696
- Eight.
- Eight moves.

05:03.770 --> 05:07.467
Every time l had to leave my friends,
my heart would just break.

05:07.540 --> 05:10.373
Here we go.

05:10.443 --> 05:13.139
l'd cry for days and days.

05:13.212 --> 05:16.841
Go on an uncontrollable downward spiral.

05:16.916 --> 05:20.613
Jill, how would you like to sit
in the back with the packing crates

05:20.687 --> 05:23.053
and the Styrofoam packing material?

05:23.756 --> 05:25.883
Excuse me,
l'm just expressing my feelings.

05:25.958 --> 05:27.789
l know how sick you are of hearing them.

05:27.860 --> 05:30.420
Oh, no, you don't.

05:32.365 --> 05:33.889
[gears grind]

05:37.170 --> 05:40.606
Hey, step on it, Uncle Marty.
Dad's getting away from us.

05:40.673 --> 05:45.007
[chuckles] Who would have thought
a truck that big could go that fast?

05:45.078 --> 05:48.946
l can't believe we have to spend
Christmas break helping Grandma move.

05:49.015 --> 05:51.176
Oh, come on!
What else would you guys be doing?

05:51.250 --> 05:53.775
- Hanging out with my girlfriend.
- Going to parties.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.582
Seeing all the new movies.

05:56.956 --> 05:59.652
Anybody interested in switching lives?

06:02.128 --> 06:04.892
<i>- Breaker, breaker.
- [man] Go ahead, Murray.</i>

06:04.964 --> 06:09.230
You got The Tool Man about 55 miles
outside of the Motor City. Come back.

06:09.302 --> 06:12.362
<i>[man] I'm at your front door
about two yardsticks.</i>

06:12.438 --> 06:15.202
<i>Watch out for the road pizza
in the granny.</i>

06:16.409 --> 06:18.536
''Road pizza in the granny?''

06:18.611 --> 06:21.910
Dead animal in the slow lane. Come on!

06:22.949 --> 06:24.109
How do you know that?

06:24.217 --> 06:27.846
<i>'Cause every time l get
a haircut l read Big Rig Digest.</i>

06:29.789 --> 06:34.749
ln about 30, l'm gonna need a motion
lotion and a pickle park. Come back.

06:36.329 --> 06:39.025
That's a restaurant and a gas station.

06:39.098 --> 06:41.965
<i>There's a gas station just ahead of you.</i>

06:42.034 --> 06:44.662
<i>I'll have to get back to you
on the hookers.</i>

06:51.611 --> 06:52.771
- Hello.
- Hi.

06:52.879 --> 06:57.043
Oh, hi, hi. Oh, it's so good to see you.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.175
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi, Mom.

06:59.252 --> 07:03.348
Mom, don't call me when
l'm doing a live show again, please.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.914
You know,
l didn't expect you here so soon.

07:05.992 --> 07:09.325
Tim decided to go
for the big-rig speed record.

07:13.766 --> 07:15.825
Why are all these boxes
marked ''fragile?''

07:15.902 --> 07:19.565
Well, l didn't know
which ones you'd be handling.

07:20.540 --> 07:22.440
Wow.

07:22.508 --> 07:27.036
Seeing all these boxes brings
back so many painful memories.

07:27.113 --> 07:30.879
- When l was a kid we moved, like...
- We know, dear. Eight times.

07:32.985 --> 07:35.351
Mom, why did you throw this out?

07:35.455 --> 07:36.979
Oh, uh, it was in bad shape,

07:37.056 --> 07:39.354
so l yanked it off the wall
and put it in the trash.

07:39.425 --> 07:40.790
Yeah, but Dad made this.

07:40.893 --> 07:44.056
Well, honey, l'm not going
to be staying in this house and, uh,

07:44.130 --> 07:46.098
there's no room
for it in my new place.

07:46.165 --> 07:48.326
Jes here.
He'll take anything.

07:48.401 --> 07:50.460
Hey, l'll take it! What is it?

07:50.536 --> 07:52.868
- Hey, hey, little brother.
- Well?

07:52.939 --> 07:55.965
Gee, l didn't recognize you
without a head wound.

07:56.809 --> 08:00.370
Well, l did recognize you
because you're still bald.

08:01.814 --> 08:05.841
How many times do l have to tell you?
l'm not bald, l'm taller than my hair.

08:06.719 --> 08:07.947
Know what? That's not it.

08:08.020 --> 08:10.716
ln this light, you've actually
gotten a little uglier.

08:10.790 --> 08:13.623
Uglier. Ah, the Tim Taylor wit, huh?

08:13.693 --> 08:16.355
lmmature and yet, uh, not funny.

08:20.766 --> 08:23.291
- Come on. Watch it, watch it, watch it.
- OK, Dad.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.335
Hey, Tim, look at this.

08:26.405 --> 08:28.839
lt's Dad's plans
from when he remodeled the house.

08:28.908 --> 08:30.739
You gotta be kiddin'!

08:34.580 --> 08:37.241
These have gotta be about 30 years old.

08:37.316 --> 08:39.147
[straining] Dad.

08:39.217 --> 08:41.448
Careful with that, it's an antique.

08:43.356 --> 08:46.723
- Randy.
- Lift with your legs.

08:46.826 --> 08:48.851
- Ah, get back here.
- This is everything.

08:48.928 --> 08:53.194
This is the bedroom, the den, the
kitchen, that dining room addition...

08:53.266 --> 08:56.758
Yeah. Look at the details Dad put in.
He must have loved doing this.

08:56.836 --> 09:00.795
Crown molding in all the rooms,
tongue-and-groove on all the floors.

09:00.873 --> 09:04.434
You're too young to remember,
but Dad hand-rebuilt that mantelpiece.

09:04.544 --> 09:08.446
Well, he had to after you tried to use
the propane tank as a fire poker.

09:14.153 --> 09:19.386
Last time l saw these plans,
l was helping Dad build this staircase.

09:20.226 --> 09:25.129
Solid maple. He let me turn one
of these balusters, install it myself.

09:27.633 --> 09:30.796
- They're fine if you don't touch them.
- Yeah.

09:30.903 --> 09:33.770
Man, we used to have
some great times in here, you know?

09:33.839 --> 09:36.399
lt's hard to believe we're not
gonna see the place again.

09:36.509 --> 09:38.204
Well...

09:38.277 --> 09:40.837
[laughs] Remember sliding down
this banister, guys?

09:40.947 --> 09:44.405
Oh, yeah. Of course, l also remember

09:44.483 --> 09:47.782
there was only one of us dumb enough
to go down facing forward.

09:49.155 --> 09:51.123
Anybody can do it backwards.

09:51.190 --> 09:54.353
Mom was wrong too.
l was still able to have children.

09:56.295 --> 09:58.126
Yeah, but look at 'em.

10:06.839 --> 10:08.170
...break.

10:09.475 --> 10:11.238
[doorbell rings]

10:11.344 --> 10:14.438
- [Jill] Tim, would you get that?
- Ah!

10:18.451 --> 10:20.009
[high-pitched] l'll get it.

10:35.334 --> 10:36.892
[woman] Hello.

10:38.571 --> 10:40.630
Oh, are... are you OK?

10:40.706 --> 10:43.038
[high-pitched] l'm fine, l'm fine.

10:43.109 --> 10:47.637
[clears throat] l just took a short
little trip down memory lane.

10:47.713 --> 10:48.680
[woman laughs]

10:48.781 --> 10:51.249
Hi. We're the Burtons,
the new owners of the house.

10:51.317 --> 10:54.081
- Tim Taylor. l used to live here.
- Hope we're not intruding.

10:54.153 --> 10:55.711
- No, no, no. Come on in.
- Great.

10:55.821 --> 10:56.788
Thanks.

10:56.889 --> 10:59.255
We were wondering
if we could take measurements.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.054
- Yeah, go ahead.
- Thanks.

11:01.127 --> 11:04.824
We need to do it before Monday because
we have a crew to rip up the floors.

11:04.897 --> 11:07.798
Rip up the floors? These
are tongue-and-groove wood floors.

11:07.867 --> 11:10.233
Well, we prefer ceramic tile.

11:10.336 --> 11:13.464
Ceramic tile doesn't really go
with anything else in the house.

11:13.539 --> 11:15.871
Oh, it will when we're done.

11:15.941 --> 11:17.272
What else are you gonna do?

11:17.343 --> 11:19.971
We're taking out all the old stuff,
like that fireplace.

11:20.046 --> 11:22.412
That fireplace is hand-built.
lt's one of a kind.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.483
We want to give it
a contemporary feeling.

11:24.583 --> 11:26.608
Put in floor-to-ceiling mirrors.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.917
Ah! Go for that fun house look.

11:32.391 --> 11:34.154
- [clears throat]
- Excuse me?

11:34.260 --> 11:36.626
Measuring the staircase?
You're taking this out?

11:36.729 --> 11:39.357
Actually, we were going
to replace it with wrought iron.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.992
Oh, yeah.

11:42.068 --> 11:46.903
That wrought iron and mirror,
there's a handsome look. Yeah.

11:46.972 --> 11:51.272
Put in a front desk, some fake ferns
and a bellhop, you got a hotel lobby.

11:51.343 --> 11:54.904
You know,
maybe we should come back another time.

11:54.980 --> 11:57.244
You know what?
l'm sorry that we bothered you.

11:57.316 --> 11:59.750
This is real craftsmanship
in this house, you know.

11:59.819 --> 12:02.447
My father and l
built this staircase by hand.

12:02.521 --> 12:04.580
This house is perfect the way it is!

12:16.202 --> 12:20.161
[mother grunts]
Who was that at the door, Tim?

12:20.239 --> 12:24.005
- Mr. and Mrs. Motel 6.
- Who?

12:24.110 --> 12:26.806
The new owners. You know
what they want to do to this place?

12:26.879 --> 12:30.713
Yeah, they mentioned a few things.
Ceramic tile, wrought-iron staircase.

12:30.783 --> 12:32.944
- That's OK with you?
- Well, it's their house.

12:33.052 --> 12:35.714
They can do whatever they want with it.

12:35.788 --> 12:38.348
You lived here 42 years
and you let people buy the house

12:38.424 --> 12:40.551
that are just gonna tear it apart?

12:40.626 --> 12:43.186
Well, what was l supposed to do?

12:44.163 --> 12:45.892
Background check?

12:47.666 --> 12:52.126
Find out how their values are, whether
they're pro or anti tongue-and-groove.

12:52.204 --> 12:56.072
Tim, l sold them the house.
l didn't put it up for adoption.

12:56.142 --> 13:00.806
- Wait. Just...
- No way. Why are you taking the toilet?

13:00.880 --> 13:02.313
Because l need a new one.

13:02.381 --> 13:06.408
No sense spending good money
when l can have this one for free.

13:07.219 --> 13:11.679
This isn't just a toilet, you know.
lt's... an heirloom.

13:13.159 --> 13:15.593
This toilet is full of memories.

13:18.297 --> 13:21.061
Yeah, for me too.
Remember the night of my bachelor party?

13:21.167 --> 13:24.603
Ooh, some major hurling in there.

13:24.670 --> 13:28.003
Hey, how about when Dad
brought back that bag of smoked chub

13:28.073 --> 13:31.008
- from the lndian reservation?
- [all laugh]

13:31.076 --> 13:33.340
That was a bad week.

13:33.412 --> 13:37.781
OK, boys, you just put that toilet right
back. lt belongs to the new owners.

13:37.850 --> 13:41.616
Ah... They'll just probably throw it out
like the rest of the stuff.

13:41.687 --> 13:45.054
- What?
- New owners, tearing out everything.

13:45.124 --> 13:47.592
Floor, the mantel.
They're taking out the stairway.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.527
How are they gonna
get to the second floor?

13:51.597 --> 13:53.758
Hey, this is serious!
They can't do that to us.

13:53.866 --> 13:55.527
This is the house where we grew up.

13:55.601 --> 13:59.560
The house where l learned you can
put a lawn mower engine on a tricycle.

14:00.606 --> 14:02.631
This is the house where l lost my hair.

14:06.345 --> 14:09.280
Whoa! ls this Dad and his hot rod?

14:09.348 --> 14:12.112
[laughs] Yeah, that's Dad.

14:13.452 --> 14:17.889
During his hippie days. His motto
was ''Peace, Love and Valvoline.''

14:20.559 --> 14:22.220
Peace.

14:22.294 --> 14:24.353
Valvoline.

14:25.965 --> 14:27.592
- Take that downstairs.
- Sure.

14:27.666 --> 14:30.032
- My first hot rod.
- Yeah.

14:30.102 --> 14:33.594
Oh, look at this cute little plane.
Did you make this?

14:33.672 --> 14:35.833
That's a Spitfire, honey.

14:35.908 --> 14:39.674
l glued that when l was 1 1 years old.
l won first prize at a hobby show.

14:39.745 --> 14:42.509
For the plane or the shelf?

14:45.050 --> 14:47.314
Let me ask you a question.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.251
You've always wanted
a vacation home?

14:49.321 --> 14:50.788
Yeah.

14:50.856 --> 14:54.087
How would you feel about buying this
and making it our getaway home?

14:56.428 --> 15:00.455
You're suggesting that we come up here
for romantic weekends

15:00.532 --> 15:03.296
and sleep in your mother's bedroom?

15:05.871 --> 15:08.032
Well, it's not like she's gonna be here.

15:09.508 --> 15:11.408
- Neither are we.
- Come on. Listen to me.

15:11.477 --> 15:13.707
- Yeah.
- The people that are buying this house

15:13.779 --> 15:16.748
are gonna rip out the floor,
take out the mantel, the staircase.

15:16.815 --> 15:18.976
The staircase?

15:19.051 --> 15:21.178
They're tearing down
the house l grew up in.

15:21.253 --> 15:23.551
Oh, no, that's awful. l'm so sorry.

15:24.390 --> 15:29.157
l know how bad Wilson felt when he took
his Mexican radishes and left the zoo.

15:30.696 --> 15:32.664
What?

15:32.731 --> 15:36.064
He just said this
was gonna be real tough.

15:36.135 --> 15:40.469
Yeah. lt's gotta be tough.

15:40.539 --> 15:43.565
l used to fall apart every time
l left a house l barely lived in,

15:43.642 --> 15:46.270
but this house has been
a part of your life for so long.

15:46.345 --> 15:50.213
Yes, it has. Dad put his heart
and soul in this place.

15:50.282 --> 15:52.512
Everything l loved about him is here.

15:54.186 --> 15:58.088
Tim... this house is really beautiful,

15:58.157 --> 16:01.320
but everything you loved about him
is something you carry with you,

16:01.393 --> 16:04.487
don't you think?
l mean, all your memories about him

16:04.563 --> 16:08.465
and what he taught you about cars
and how to work with tools.

16:08.534 --> 16:11.469
How to be a great dad.

16:11.537 --> 16:14.904
l mean, who showed you how to shoot
those peas right out of your nose?

16:17.109 --> 16:18.667
Mom.

16:20.946 --> 16:24.609
Dad taught us how to use six parts
of our body as a musical instrument.

16:26.518 --> 16:28.782
- Seven.
- [laughs]

16:30.189 --> 16:33.215
Oh, boy.
Ah, you're probably right.

16:33.292 --> 16:36.784
No matter what these people do, they
can't take the memory of him from me.

16:36.862 --> 16:38.022
Yeah.

16:39.865 --> 16:42.959
Your dad must have been a great guy.
l wish l had met him.

16:43.035 --> 16:45.003
He was a great guy.

16:45.070 --> 16:48.335
He would have loved you,
loved everything about you.

16:48.407 --> 16:52.241
- Yeah.
- Except maybe that turkey tetrazzini.

16:57.683 --> 17:00.049
[Tim] Mom,
can l talk to you for a minute?

17:00.152 --> 17:01.449
Sure, honey.

17:02.254 --> 17:06.190
- l'm sorry l snapped at you earlier.
- Oh, listen, that's all right.

17:06.258 --> 17:10.887
You know, l never realized that leaving
this house would be so tough on you.

17:10.963 --> 17:15.023
Neither did l. l'm just
surprised how well you're doing.

17:15.099 --> 17:17.193
- [laughs] How well l'm doing?
- Yeah.

17:17.269 --> 17:20.136
Oh, honey, if you realized
how many years l've spent thinking

17:20.204 --> 17:22.673
about this day
and crying about it a lot.

17:22.741 --> 17:26.074
l'm sorry. You know, l don't mean
to make you feel bad about this.

17:26.145 --> 17:29.911
- Tim, l just love this house.
- Yeah.

17:30.015 --> 17:35.681
Everywhere l look
there's just a wonderful memory.

17:35.754 --> 17:40.123
You know, l'll never forget
all the Christmases we've had here.

17:40.192 --> 17:42.285
The whole family
gathered around the table

17:42.361 --> 17:45.057
and the fire burning in the fireplace.

17:45.130 --> 17:47.360
The turkey burning in the oven.

17:50.502 --> 17:53.403
Do you remember the Christmas
after Marty was born?

17:53.472 --> 17:56.839
Do l? We're upstairs babysitting,
his belly button falls off.

17:56.942 --> 17:58.409
Scared the hell out of all of us.

17:58.477 --> 18:02.311
''Mom, you had better get up here.
l think this kid's falling apart.''

18:04.083 --> 18:08.247
That was the... that was the Christmas
l helped Dad finish the staircase.

18:18.297 --> 18:21.664
- Hey, Tim. Tim.
- [young Tim] Yeah, Dad?

18:21.733 --> 18:24.896
l want to check your measurements
for the carpeting for the stairs.

18:25.003 --> 18:28.234
You don't have to. l already cut it.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.841
Oh, no.

18:31.276 --> 18:34.109
Don't worry. l know what l'm doing.

18:38.383 --> 18:40.351
Oh, no.

18:41.854 --> 18:43.287
Tim, what did l tell you?

18:43.355 --> 18:47.917
You gotta measure twice and cut once.
Plus, l didn't ask you to cut it, son.

18:47.993 --> 18:50.518
Sorry. l guess l messed up again.

18:50.596 --> 18:52.291
Ah, it's all right.

18:52.364 --> 18:55.993
Working with tools,
it's not for everybody and, well,

18:56.068 --> 18:59.697
when you grow up you'll find something
that's more suitable for you.

18:59.771 --> 19:03.730
[mother] Michael, Tim,
time to get ready for dinner.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.674
l can smell the turkey burning.

19:05.744 --> 19:11.478
Son, there is nothing like
your mother's turkey. All dark meat.

19:15.621 --> 19:20.490
You know, Tim, as hard as it's
gonna be for me leaving this house,

19:20.559 --> 19:24.723
l am so happy to be moving closer to you
and Marty and all the grandchildren.

19:24.796 --> 19:27.321
We're gonna be happy to have you.
lt's gonna be OK.

19:27.399 --> 19:28.764
l know, l know.

19:28.834 --> 19:31.928
Wait a minute. l've got an idea.

19:32.004 --> 19:35.462
How would you feel about having
one last Christmas dinner here tonight?

19:35.541 --> 19:38.009
Well, honey,
Christmas isn't until Wednesday,

19:38.076 --> 19:39.976
and we've packed up the whole house.

19:40.045 --> 19:44.539
So we order food in. We'll eat on the
floor like a pre-Christmas scrimmage.

19:44.616 --> 19:46.550
- You know, that could be great.
- Yeah.

19:46.618 --> 19:49.451
Do you know that the first night
your father and l moved here,

19:49.521 --> 19:52.888
we ate on the floor?
We had this romantic dinner

19:52.958 --> 19:57.327
- and then we danced and... and...
- Mom. Mom.

19:59.097 --> 20:01.361
More than l need to know.

20:04.536 --> 20:07.437
Oh, this is so wonderful.

20:07.506 --> 20:11.272
lt's just like all the Christmases
we used to have here.

20:11.343 --> 20:13.607
Except that we're eating off the floor.

20:13.679 --> 20:16.113
Steve and John
aren't burping the national anthem.

20:16.181 --> 20:18.274
[all laugh]

20:18.350 --> 20:22.116
lnstead of burnt turkey,
we're having pizza and linguine.

20:22.187 --> 20:24.280
After dinner,
why don't we all go caroling?

20:24.356 --> 20:26.916
We can sing,
''l'm dreaming of a white clam sauce.''

20:26.992 --> 20:30.723
- Not bad.
- Or ''Deck the halls with calamari.''

20:30.796 --> 20:32.263
Oh, boy!

20:32.331 --> 20:35.892
- ''Silent night, cannoli night.''
- Better.

20:35.968 --> 20:37.936
They're just like us
when we were kids.

20:38.003 --> 20:39.971
Yeah, except they're clever.

20:43.308 --> 20:45.276
Well, l'm stuffed.

20:45.377 --> 20:48.813
Yeah. Me too. Look, l'll,
uh, l'll take all the leftovers.

20:48.880 --> 20:52.839
l'm having some people
over tomorrow night.

20:54.186 --> 20:56.620
- How are you, honey?
- l'm good.

20:56.688 --> 21:00.385
l was just thinking
how much l'm like this house.

21:00.459 --> 21:03.087
You mean you both have old, leaky pipes?

21:03.662 --> 21:06.825
l'm speaking metaphorically.

21:06.932 --> 21:09.457
Metaphorically?
You actually know what that means?

21:09.534 --> 21:13.834
l have a neighbor
who explains stuff like this to me.

21:13.905 --> 21:15.873
So how are you like this house?

21:15.974 --> 21:18.704
OK, when they said they
were ripping out the insides,

21:18.777 --> 21:21.940
l felt like they
were ripping out my insides.

21:22.047 --> 21:25.608
Listen, since the Burtons
are tearing this all apart,

21:25.717 --> 21:28.982
why don't you boys just
take whatever's important to you?

21:29.054 --> 21:32.546
- Really? l'll flip you for the toilet.
- OK.

21:32.624 --> 21:35.149
l want the mantel and banister.
lf that's all right.

21:35.227 --> 21:38.993
Because l can just tear this one
out here and replace it at our house.

21:39.064 --> 21:41.294
As long as l've
got the sledgehammer out...

21:41.366 --> 21:43.459
Oh, no.

21:47.406 --> 21:49.374
[tires screeching]

21:50.509 --> 21:53.967
You're too young to remember,
but Dad hand-built that mantelpiece.

21:54.046 --> 21:58.073
He had to after that little incident
with Gl Joe and the bottle rocket.

21:59.751 --> 22:03.380
Uh, Dad, Grandma says look
behind you. There's a raccoon.

22:03.455 --> 22:06.424
Really? And there's
a hippopotamus up on the roof.

22:06.491 --> 22:07.719
[Al] Tim?

22:07.793 --> 22:10.318
Actually, there is
a hippopotamus up on the roof.

22:10.395 --> 22:13.364
- She's not kiddin' you.
- Oh!
