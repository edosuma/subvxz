WEBVTT

00:01.635 --> 00:03.437
Lemon Breeland,
I hereby accuse you of behavior

00:03.537 --> 00:05.206
unbecoming a Belle.

00:05.306 --> 00:06.340
Interesting.
I already know
what you're gonna say.

00:06.440 --> 00:07.308
Friends that treat
friends like that

00:08.076 --> 00:08.876
aren't even friends at all.
Maybe.

00:08.976 --> 00:10.544
I don't have any
interest in being part

00:11.612 --> 00:12.580
of an organization that
would ask me to remove gum

00:13.381 --> 00:14.282
from the sidewalk.
 I remember

00:15.449 --> 00:16.617
every bad review. You
hated The Cicada's Lament.

00:17.885 --> 00:19.520
Well, surely
you didn't hate the book.
He gave it one star.

00:20.788 --> 00:22.056
See, I wouldn't have
been that harsh if I
didn't really hate it.

00:22.990 --> 00:23.557
I moved back here
to be BlueBell's doctor.

00:24.492 --> 00:25.526
I'm back in BlueBell,
and I can't practice.

00:26.560 --> 00:27.361
I am gonna hire somebody--
not a partner, somebody

00:28.129 --> 00:29.029
who could maybe
work their way up.

00:29.997 --> 00:30.364
You wouldn't know anybody
who'd be interested

00:31.031 --> 00:32.500
in that position,
would you?

00:33.467 --> 00:35.136
(Wade speaking quietly)

00:35.236 --> 00:36.470
(woman laughing)

00:36.570 --> 00:38.272
WADE:
You ready to go again?

00:38.372 --> 00:40.208
(woman laughing)

00:40.308 --> 00:41.575
Well, that was fun.

00:41.675 --> 00:44.078
But I got to shower
and get to work.

00:45.413 --> 00:47.515
(quietly):
My kind of gal.

00:47.615 --> 00:50.551
(pounding on door)

00:52.353 --> 00:54.355
(pounding continues)

00:58.159 --> 01:00.194
Could I help you?

01:00.294 --> 01:01.329
Yeah.

01:02.430 --> 01:04.364
I heard my girlfriend left
the Rammer Jammer last night

01:04.465 --> 01:07.235
with a guy named
Wade Kinsella.

01:07.335 --> 01:09.237
You Wade Kinsella?

01:09.337 --> 01:10.671
No, sir, I am not.

01:10.771 --> 01:13.541
No, uh, no, Wade Kinsella
hasn't lived here for years.

01:13.641 --> 01:16.144
Yeah, well,
if you see him...

01:16.244 --> 01:19.079
you tell him Randall's
looking for him.

01:19.180 --> 01:20.481
Will do.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.116
Best of luck
to you, pal.

01:25.653 --> 01:28.422
WANDA:
Dash? Oh, Dash?

01:28.522 --> 01:31.292
Where should I put the
beakers with the green glop?

01:31.392 --> 01:33.461
Uh, I'll take them.
Thank you.

01:33.561 --> 01:35.095
Now, remember, folks,

01:35.196 --> 01:37.365
my show starts promptly
at 7:00 tomorrow.

01:37.465 --> 01:40.301
My monster does not
take kindly to latecomers.

01:40.401 --> 01:42.503
(growls)

01:42.603 --> 01:45.573
(laughs)
(chuckles):
Oh, my God.

01:45.673 --> 01:48.376
I have to send this
to my friend Justin
at the Paris Review.

01:48.476 --> 01:50.144
He is going to flip out.

01:50.244 --> 01:51.279
Also, we must go.

01:51.379 --> 01:54.248
It's four hours long,
the third act is in German,

01:54.348 --> 01:55.649
and Dash plays all the parts.

01:55.749 --> 01:57.451
I'm camping out
in line.

01:57.551 --> 01:59.153
Hey. There's
A.B. and Lavon.

01:59.253 --> 02:00.221
Let's go join them.

02:00.321 --> 02:02.190
Wait, no, no, no,
no, no. Mm-mm.

02:02.290 --> 02:03.724
Okay, look, I know
that you and Lavon

02:03.824 --> 02:05.493
got off on
the wrong foot, but...

02:05.593 --> 02:07.295
it's really important
for you to make friends here,

02:07.395 --> 02:08.696
and Lavon's the best.

02:08.795 --> 02:10.663
Zoe, I know you love him,
but the only thing

02:10.764 --> 02:12.700
that Lavon and I have in
common is a mutual aversion.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.268
You're wrong.

02:14.368 --> 02:18.272
Together, we will bridge
the athlete/mathlete divide.

02:20.441 --> 02:21.509
Hey there.

02:21.609 --> 02:23.577
Mind if Joel and I
join you guys?

02:23.677 --> 02:25.145
Sorry, finishing up.
Sounds great!

02:25.246 --> 02:26.647
Lavon!
Lavon!

02:26.747 --> 02:29.383
Look, Z, I-I'm sure your
new beau is amazing,

02:29.483 --> 02:31.519
but he and I have
nothing in common.

02:31.619 --> 02:34.154
You do, too-- me,
your best friend.

02:34.255 --> 02:36.156
And we will hang.

02:36.257 --> 02:37.525
Alone. Call me.

02:37.625 --> 02:38.559
Uh...

02:39.560 --> 02:41.262
(groans)

02:44.465 --> 02:46.434
(sighs):
So... Roll Tide and I

02:46.534 --> 02:48.269
heading out
to a poetry reading?

02:48.369 --> 02:49.737
Shut up.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.372
And what is a hairy eyeball?

02:51.472 --> 02:53.307
It's that look you're
giving Crickett right now.

02:53.407 --> 02:54.575
What gives, Lemon?

02:54.675 --> 02:57.177
I quit the Belles,
so she had me blacklisted.

02:57.278 --> 02:59.347
From the Junior League
Halloween Masquerade party.

02:59.447 --> 03:01.415
That's a crime against humanity.
Listen, I have

03:01.515 --> 03:03.617
to get into that party,
or I will have no hope

03:03.717 --> 03:05.453
of dating a decent man
in this state.

03:05.553 --> 03:08.456
Okay, fine. I'm going--
you can be my plus-one.

03:08.556 --> 03:10.624
Hey, you guys could go
as that married couple

03:10.724 --> 03:12.226
(laughs):
that never got married.

03:13.594 --> 03:15.596
What? That was funny.

03:15.696 --> 03:18.532
Listen, George, this isn't
a social event for me, okay?

03:18.632 --> 03:20.234
This is damage control.

03:20.334 --> 03:21.769
I just think that walking in
with my ex-fiancé

03:21.869 --> 03:23.437
just wouldn't send
the right message.

03:23.537 --> 03:24.738
Fair enough.

03:26.006 --> 03:28.442
Well, then it looks to me that
you only got one choice left.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.478
Fine. I'll keep
my gag reflex in check,

03:30.578 --> 03:32.280
and I'll just
go talk to Crickett.

03:32.380 --> 03:34.214
No. Calling your grandmother.

03:34.315 --> 03:36.584
The Don Corleone
of the Alabama social scene.

03:36.684 --> 03:38.452
Are you out of your mind?

03:38.552 --> 03:39.753
Calling Grandma Bettie
is like inviting

03:39.853 --> 03:41.755
a great white shark
to your pool party.

03:41.855 --> 03:44.224
Do you not remember
the toast that she gave

03:44.325 --> 03:46.226
at our rehearsal dinner?
Not the exact words,

03:46.327 --> 03:48.762
but I do remember about a dozen
people bursting into tears.

03:48.862 --> 03:51.465
Yes. Which is why
I'm gonna go do this.

03:51.565 --> 03:52.700
Good luck.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.368
(sighs)

03:57.405 --> 03:58.772
(exhales heavily)

03:58.872 --> 04:01.509
Crickett, listen,

04:01.609 --> 04:03.377
I know that we've had
our differences,

04:03.477 --> 04:07.481
but out of respect for our past,
and the fact that karma is real,

04:07.581 --> 04:09.583
I was hoping you could
get me back on the list

04:09.683 --> 04:11.519
for the Halloween
Masquerade Ball.

04:13.754 --> 04:14.788
Crickett?

04:14.888 --> 04:16.390
Did you hear me?

04:17.391 --> 04:20.260
I am so sorry, Lemon...

04:20.361 --> 04:21.661
but in deference

04:21.762 --> 04:25.299
to my Belle sisters,
I will not fall prey

04:25.399 --> 04:27.368
to your manipulation.

04:27.468 --> 04:28.402
Are you reading that?

04:28.502 --> 04:29.337
Did Tara Jane tell you

04:29.437 --> 04:31.572
what to say in case
I asked for help?

04:31.672 --> 04:33.273
Crickett Belinda Watts,

04:33.374 --> 04:34.808
I have been your friend
since third grade,

04:34.908 --> 04:36.377
since before
you were even pretty.

04:36.477 --> 04:39.313
In deference
to my Belle sisters,

04:39.413 --> 04:40.448
I will not pray...

04:40.548 --> 04:42.783
fall prey...

04:43.917 --> 04:45.886
The answer is no!

04:45.986 --> 04:47.588
(quietly):
Oh, God...

04:47.688 --> 04:49.690
Ooh! Hey, you got to...
Watch where you're going!

04:49.790 --> 04:51.559
got to signal before
you turn like that.

04:51.659 --> 04:53.293
Uh, okay, I'm...

04:53.394 --> 04:55.363
I'm sorry. I just got
a flat up the road...

04:55.463 --> 04:56.830
Okay, do I look like Triple-A?

04:56.930 --> 04:57.865
Hmm?

04:58.899 --> 05:01.702
I know what
you're thinking.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.771
What if she were
Triple-A, right?

05:03.871 --> 05:06.807
What can I do you for?
I got a sidewall
flat down the road.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.442
Is there an
auto shop nearby?

05:08.542 --> 05:10.444
Yeah, what you're gonna do is...

05:10.544 --> 05:12.780
(quietly):
I'll tell you what,
I can do you one better,

05:12.880 --> 05:14.415
I'll take you there myself.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.384
Oh.
Come on.

05:16.484 --> 05:19.319
WADE:
I'll drop you up the road.
We'll take my car.

05:19.420 --> 05:22.856
LAVON:
So, I was thinking we might
skip that show tomorrow.

05:22.956 --> 05:25.926
ANNABETH:
Of course! With Lynly
visiting her parents,

05:26.026 --> 05:28.729
we have your house
to ourselves.
Okay.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.564
Not that I don't
miss her terribly.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.600
Now, you may not remember,
but tomorrow night

05:32.700 --> 05:34.868
is the one-year anniversary
of our first date.

05:34.968 --> 05:37.471
The night that we pretended
to be a couple?

05:37.571 --> 05:40.441
Oh, I don't
consider that... as...

05:40.541 --> 05:42.443
Our anniversary!

05:42.543 --> 05:43.811
It is!
Yeah.

05:43.911 --> 05:45.913
And... I have something
special planned,

05:46.013 --> 05:47.615
just for the two of us.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.950
Mmm, sounds romantic.
What are we doing?

05:50.050 --> 05:51.952
I can't tell you;
it's a surprise.

05:52.052 --> 05:53.387
At least give me a hint.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.423
Okay, all I can
tell you is that

05:55.523 --> 05:57.391
there will be champagne.

05:57.491 --> 05:59.359
Mmm, I love the bubbly.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.861
Oh, oh, and my
homemade pumpkin pie.

06:00.961 --> 06:03.464
Oh! That's my favorite.
And...

06:03.564 --> 06:04.732
one other thing

06:04.832 --> 06:06.900
that I promise will
make this a night

06:07.000 --> 06:09.537
you will remember forever.

06:13.541 --> 06:14.875
BRICK:
 So, you take care, now.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.877
Oh, Dr. Hart,

06:16.977 --> 06:19.913
how is that inventory
checklist coming?

06:20.013 --> 06:22.616
722 cotton balls,

06:22.716 --> 06:24.618
243 alcohol swabs,

06:24.718 --> 06:26.654
and 43 lollipops.

06:26.754 --> 06:27.921
Oh. Actually, 42.

06:28.021 --> 06:28.956
ANNABETH:
Hi, everybody!

06:29.790 --> 06:32.392
Oh, don't you
just love Halloween?

06:32.493 --> 06:33.794
(laughs):
So full of surprises.
Yeah,

06:33.894 --> 06:36.396
42 stomachaches and
16 allergic reactions

06:36.497 --> 06:37.698
just last year.

06:37.798 --> 06:38.932
Maybe the office should hand out

06:39.032 --> 06:40.400
Pepto-Bismol
instead of candy tonight.

06:40.501 --> 06:41.902
Or will that cut into
the day-after business?

06:42.002 --> 06:43.571
Oh, thank you, Jerry Seinfeld.

06:43.671 --> 06:44.838
Oh, and, AnnaBeth,
don't forget,

06:44.938 --> 06:46.474
you have your insurance
physical today.

06:46.574 --> 06:47.608
Oh, can Zoe do it?

06:47.708 --> 06:48.776
I have some
girl things

06:49.743 --> 06:50.644
I really, really need
to discuss with her.

06:51.612 --> 06:53.714
Yes! A patient who needs
a doctor who is me.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.683
(sighs)
Well, fine.

06:55.783 --> 06:57.685
Then, Dr. Hart,
you need to recount

06:57.785 --> 07:00.521
those tongue depressors.

07:02.756 --> 07:06.426
ZOE: So, it's your one-year
anniversary of your first date

07:06.527 --> 07:07.761
and there's
gonna be champagne

07:07.861 --> 07:10.664
and your favorite dessert--
and one other thing?

07:10.764 --> 07:13.967
He promised it would be
a night I'd remember forever.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.669
Oh, my God!
Are you thinking

07:15.769 --> 07:18.005
the "one other thing"
is what I'm thinking it is?

07:18.105 --> 07:20.708
I don't know, because I'm trying
not to get ahead of myself,

07:20.808 --> 07:22.442
because we haven't
been together that long,

07:22.543 --> 07:23.977
but out of curiosity,
what are you thinking?

07:24.077 --> 07:26.647
Uh, that you're gonna have
a super fun night,

07:26.747 --> 07:28.782
and maybe you should
get a manicure.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.784
So my hand looks beautiful
in case...

07:30.884 --> 07:32.520
Huh.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.454
What?

07:34.555 --> 07:36.857
I just, I feel
a growth on your ovary.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.792
I-It's probably nothing,
but I'm gonna

07:38.892 --> 07:40.961
send you to Mobile tomorrow
for some tests.

07:41.061 --> 07:42.863
Tests? Like...
multiple-choice tests,

07:42.963 --> 07:44.998
or, like, "I need to get
my parents back

07:45.098 --> 07:46.466
"from their retirement cruise

07:46.567 --> 07:48.669
and auction off
my shoe collection" tests?

07:48.769 --> 07:51.772
Well, no, a growth
can, um, signify...

07:51.872 --> 07:53.607
a number of things.

07:53.707 --> 07:57.077
You know, of which 90%
are absolutely benign.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.647
Like a cyst or a small fibroid.

07:59.747 --> 08:02.583
But there's still a ten percent
chance it could be...

08:02.683 --> 08:03.784
something else?

08:03.884 --> 08:05.719
Well, that's why
I'm ordering the tests.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.488
Hey, I'll go with you.

08:08.589 --> 08:10.057
And we'll get that manicure
on the way back.

08:10.157 --> 08:12.492
Look, A.B.,
I know it's hard,

08:12.593 --> 08:14.027
but try not to worry.

08:14.127 --> 08:15.095
Right.

08:15.195 --> 08:17.497
It'll be a piece of cake.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.768
LEMON:
 Daddy!

08:20.868 --> 08:21.869
Lemonade!

08:21.969 --> 08:23.503
Oh, you are so...

08:23.604 --> 08:26.540
handsome and sweet
and understanding.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.609
Oh, God,
what do you need?

08:28.709 --> 08:30.778
Due to recent missteps
not to be rehashed,

08:30.878 --> 08:32.880
my social life is
at a code red,

08:32.980 --> 08:36.515
and the only way to fix it
is to call on Grandma.

08:36.616 --> 08:37.784
Absolutely not!

08:37.885 --> 08:40.788
Do I need to remind you
of the one silver lining

08:40.888 --> 08:42.990
in the disaster that was
your near-wedding day?

08:43.090 --> 08:46.526
But she was so humiliated,
she's refused to set foot
in BlueBell since.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.729
And what a gloriously
peaceful 18 months

08:48.829 --> 08:51.031
and, oh, 14 days
it has been.

08:51.131 --> 08:53.801
Well, see, the
thing is, Daddy...

08:53.901 --> 08:55.836
this was an emergency.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.938
You already called her.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.140
Oh, Lordy, bring me
the defibrillator.
I'm sorry.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.876
But maybe she has
softened with age.

09:02.976 --> 09:06.980
Rumor has it that you've rehired
that carpetbaggin' she-doctor.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.149
How is that a
good decision?

09:09.249 --> 09:13.721
Mother! We are
so happy to see you.

09:13.821 --> 09:15.188
(laughs) As
you should be.

09:15.288 --> 09:18.826
Last time I set foot in
BlueBell, your daughter
had been abandoned

09:18.926 --> 09:21.929
at the altar like a
lame horse on derby day.

09:22.029 --> 09:25.065
Now she can't even secure
a simple party invitation.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.868
Well, if you are speaking
of the Halloween Masquerade,

09:27.968 --> 09:29.970
those invitations
are very hard...
Bertram...

09:30.070 --> 09:31.872
when it's your
turn to speak,

09:31.972 --> 09:33.573
you will know.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.609
I have heard

09:35.709 --> 09:38.746
your cry for help
loud and clear.

09:38.846 --> 09:41.181
In the nick of time, too--
there's only so much scandal

09:41.281 --> 09:44.618
that the Breeland name
should be asked to endure.

09:44.718 --> 09:45.686
(Lemon and Bettie chuckle)

09:45.786 --> 09:47.587
Come, Lemon,

09:47.688 --> 09:50.590
if the Red Sea can be parted,
perhaps we can resurrect

09:50.691 --> 09:52.993
your social standing
from the dead.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.729
Chop-chop.

09:55.829 --> 09:59.032
Oh, you're so right--
she has softened with age.

10:01.802 --> 10:04.071
(car horn honks)

10:04.171 --> 10:06.139
(seagulls calling)

10:06.239 --> 10:08.642
(birds singing)

10:16.083 --> 10:17.818
I scheduled a consult
with Dr. Blackwell.

10:17.918 --> 10:20.020
He's gonna do an internal
ultrasound and a blood test.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.122
And we should be home
in time for dinner.

10:22.222 --> 10:24.658
Okay, so it's like
a spa day, only...

10:24.758 --> 10:26.059
a little more painful.

10:26.159 --> 10:28.061
Thank you so much
for coming with me.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.763
Of course.
JOEL:
Hey, AnnaBeth.

10:29.863 --> 10:31.799
Hey, babe.
Hey.
(horn honks)

10:32.900 --> 10:34.968
Happy Halloween, Doc!

10:35.068 --> 10:37.705
Uh, excuse me.

10:37.805 --> 10:39.206
I need to check my boyfriend
for possible brain damage.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.240
I'll meet you at the car.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.642
What-what are you doing?

10:42.743 --> 10:45.779
Oh, uh, we're taking a trip
to a place known as Chickasaw

10:45.879 --> 10:47.114
to pick up dry ice

10:48.315 --> 10:49.082
for Dash's Frankenstein show
tonight. It's gonna be great.

10:49.883 --> 10:50.918
You should come.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

10:51.719 --> 10:52.652
We'll, uh, try not
to make you feel

10:53.386 --> 10:53.921
like too much of
a third wheel.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.023
No, I'm pretty sure Chickasaw
is on my list of places

10:56.957 --> 10:57.758
to never ever go.
And even if I wanted to,

10:57.858 --> 10:59.993
which I don't,
I have to go to Mobile

11:00.093 --> 11:01.962
with a patient.
I thought AnnaBeth
was a receptionist.

11:02.062 --> 11:02.963
Is she okay?

11:03.063 --> 11:03.964
I can't talk about that.

11:04.064 --> 11:05.032
Can I speak to you in private?

11:07.200 --> 11:08.969
What are you doing with him?

11:09.069 --> 11:10.904
What? You said it was important
for me to make friends.

11:11.004 --> 11:11.905
I'm making friends.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.274
Yeah, but with Wade? Wade? Why?

11:14.374 --> 11:16.009
H-He's cool. He's got
a pickup truck.

11:16.109 --> 11:18.078
I've never been
in a pickup truck.
Sorry to interrupt,

11:18.178 --> 11:20.680
lovebirds, but we're, uh...
we're losin' daylight.

11:20.781 --> 11:23.016
And, what, the headlights
on his pickup truck don't work?

11:23.116 --> 11:24.684
(chuckles)
Hey.

11:24.785 --> 11:26.153
I'll see you
at the show tonight, all right?

11:26.253 --> 11:27.721
You know, I might get a tattoo.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.022
Shut up.

11:29.122 --> 11:30.924
Of a pickup truck.
What can you do?

11:31.024 --> 11:32.960
Your boyfriend recognizes
cool. (chuckles)

11:42.535 --> 11:45.238
Daddy, really?
Scotch for breakfast?

11:45.338 --> 11:48.241
It is the only way.
She is a monster.

11:48.341 --> 11:50.978
Listen, I agree, but drinkin'
is not the answer.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.245
BETTIE:
There you are!

11:52.345 --> 11:54.014
Lemon, where have you been?

11:54.114 --> 11:55.715
I called you
over an hour ago.

11:55.816 --> 11:58.218
What did you come by,
horse and buggy?

11:58.318 --> 11:59.252
Bertram,

12:00.120 --> 12:01.121
are you drinking liquor
for breakfast?

12:01.221 --> 12:03.723
(laughs)
Of course not.

12:03.824 --> 12:06.026
That was... left out
from last night. (chuckles)

12:06.126 --> 12:08.762
Mm-hmm. Well,
luckily for you, Lemon,

12:08.862 --> 12:10.330
I snapped my fingers,
and not only

12:10.430 --> 12:12.165
do you have an invitation
to the party,

12:12.265 --> 12:15.769
but the eligible
Mr. Tanner Hughes is your date.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.004
(gasps)
Thank you, Grandma.

12:17.104 --> 12:18.906
You are a miracle worker.

12:19.006 --> 12:21.008
(chuckling):
I hope so.

12:21.108 --> 12:22.876
'Cause it's gonna take a miracle

12:22.976 --> 12:24.778
to fix your hair
before Tanner picks you up.

12:24.878 --> 12:28.148
Now let's go see
if Susie can raise her game.

12:28.248 --> 12:32.152
Oh, and just because
I'm focused on the Titanic

12:32.252 --> 12:33.353
which is your daughter's life,

12:33.453 --> 12:35.288
does not mean
that I have forgotten

12:35.388 --> 12:37.157
about the Hindenburg
which is yours.

12:37.257 --> 12:40.360
Mother, I am so pleased you
have not lost your propensity

12:40.460 --> 12:43.030
for exaggeration
and hyperbole.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.097
Mm-hmm.

12:48.168 --> 12:49.970
You're right. It's the only way.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.242
The only way.

12:55.342 --> 12:56.944
ZOE:
 The good news is,

12:57.044 --> 12:59.779
it's definitely not a tumor.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.816
I realize how that sounds
like you just won the
world's worst game show.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.351
What about all
the other things

13:04.451 --> 13:07.054
the gynecologist
hasn't ruled out yet?

13:07.154 --> 13:08.188
Zoe...

13:09.923 --> 13:11.791
...I've always wanted
to have children.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.126
Wh-What if I can't?

13:14.394 --> 13:16.063
Dr. Blackwell said the chances
of infertility are very small.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.098
We'll know more tomorrow. If I
were you, I just... I wouldn't

13:18.731 --> 13:19.199
think about it until then.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.333
Really?

13:21.334 --> 13:22.335
Would you be able
to stop thinking about it?

13:23.403 --> 13:25.305
No, but I am significantly
more neurotic than you.

13:25.405 --> 13:27.007
Oh, not today.

13:27.107 --> 13:29.176
The weight of not knowing
is consuming me.

13:29.276 --> 13:31.078
I can't let Lavon
propose tonight,

13:31.178 --> 13:33.947
not with this huge unknown
hanging over my head.

13:34.047 --> 13:35.182
Oh, crab on a cracker.

13:35.282 --> 13:37.284
What if we get him
to put it off?

13:37.384 --> 13:39.386
We'll say you're sick.
I'll write a note. We'll
say it's something

13:39.486 --> 13:42.022
very contagious, like-like
pinkeye. Ooh, or bird flu!

13:42.122 --> 13:44.892
Yeah, let's not render me
totally unappealing.

13:44.992 --> 13:45.993
Right.

13:46.093 --> 13:47.327
How 'bout this.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.329
Do you know
how Lavon loves Beyoncé?

13:49.429 --> 13:52.199
Well, she is playing in New
Orleans. What would you say

13:52.299 --> 13:55.102
if I got my mom to score you
two tickets for tonight?

13:55.202 --> 13:57.938
I'd say you'd be saving my life.
Right?

13:58.038 --> 14:00.040
They don't even teach this stuff
in medical school.

14:00.140 --> 14:01.341
Huh.

14:01.441 --> 14:02.876
WANDA:
 Rise and shine, Frankenstein.

14:02.976 --> 14:04.978
(growls)
(chuckles)

14:05.078 --> 14:07.280
Hey-o.
Oh.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.382
Wade, a guy came
by looking for you.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.885
I think his name
was Randall.

14:11.985 --> 14:12.986
Randall.
I told him

14:13.086 --> 14:13.987
you'd be working the bar later

14:14.087 --> 14:15.989
during Dash's show.

14:16.089 --> 14:17.891
You're welcome!

14:18.926 --> 14:21.428
(Frankenstein growls)

14:21.528 --> 14:23.897
WADE:
Hey, Tucker,

14:23.997 --> 14:26.866
you still looking for a plus-one
to that invitation-only,

14:26.967 --> 14:29.102
exclusive Halloween Masquerade
party in Mobile tonight?

14:29.202 --> 14:31.004
Uh... (chuckles)
no offense, Wade,

14:31.104 --> 14:33.140
but I'm not looking to
be set up right now.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.408
But, Tucker, you can't say no
to this person.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.410
Why? Who is she?

14:37.510 --> 14:39.446
She's a me.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.251
(chuckles)
Well?

14:44.351 --> 14:46.119
What do you think?

14:46.219 --> 14:50.157
Oh, I do believe we bought you
another year on the block.

14:50.257 --> 14:51.925
(chuckles)
Oh.

14:52.025 --> 14:53.293
Watch the flyaways, honey.

14:53.393 --> 14:54.427
(doorbell rings)
(gasps)
Oh.

14:54.527 --> 14:56.396
Oh. (chuckles)
That must be Tanner.

14:56.496 --> 14:59.032
Grandma, I just want to let you
know how much

14:59.132 --> 15:00.968
I appreciate everything
that you've done for me.

15:01.068 --> 15:03.070
And should Tanner and I marry,
we will name our beautiful

15:03.170 --> 15:05.038
and perfect children after you.

15:05.138 --> 15:07.240
(laughs)
I should hope so.

15:07.340 --> 15:08.241
And I want you to know

15:08.341 --> 15:11.078
I spent a good deal
of my valuable capital

15:11.178 --> 15:13.213
selling Tanner on you,
so don't mess this up.

15:13.313 --> 15:14.914
TANNER:
Now, where are
those beautiful

15:15.015 --> 15:16.916
Breeland ladies?

15:17.017 --> 15:18.451
BETTIE:
Oh, Tanner Hughes,

15:18.551 --> 15:21.388
meet my lovely
granddaughter, Lemon.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.092
Lemon,

15:25.192 --> 15:28.128
my goodness,
what a vision.

15:28.228 --> 15:29.229
Oh, likewise.

15:29.329 --> 15:30.964
Grandma Breeland,
you did not lie.

15:31.064 --> 15:33.033
She is a thoroughbred.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.267
I'm sorry, what?

15:34.367 --> 15:37.304
Oh, I hope you are not offended
by my equine terminology.

15:37.404 --> 15:40.440
I consider horses more
evolved than most people,

15:40.540 --> 15:42.942
so that was a compliment.

15:43.043 --> 15:45.012
(chuckles)
Are you ready
for the night

15:45.112 --> 15:46.146
of your life?

15:46.246 --> 15:48.948
Am I ever.
Mmm.

15:49.049 --> 15:51.551
See y'all at the party.
And, Lemon...

15:52.785 --> 15:54.354
...you're welcome.

16:01.594 --> 16:04.231
(classical music playing)

16:04.331 --> 16:06.466
Hot women in masks.

16:08.168 --> 16:09.402
Why not just call
the party that?

16:09.502 --> 16:11.104
They should put you
on the event committee.

16:11.204 --> 16:12.505
Yeah, they should.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.374
Oh, uh, Judge Perkins.

16:14.474 --> 16:17.010
Hey, how are you?
Well, George Tucker,

16:17.110 --> 16:18.511
I thought you traded in
your bar membership

16:18.611 --> 16:20.547
for the life
of a debauched country star.

16:20.647 --> 16:23.050
No, I assure you
that was only a vacation.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.118
And I can assure you of that,
Your Honor. It is...

16:25.218 --> 16:27.120
Nice to see you!
Hey, I'm gonna
take a few laps,

16:27.220 --> 16:28.355
uh, check out
the talent.

16:28.455 --> 16:30.290
Okay, well, try and stay
out of trouble.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.125
Hey. Save a slow dance
for me, Tucker.

16:32.225 --> 16:34.127
(chuckles)
Will do.

16:37.630 --> 16:40.600
I can't believe Lemon
secured both an invite

16:40.700 --> 16:43.103
and Tanner Hughes.

16:43.203 --> 16:45.205
Bettie Breeland is
like the president...

16:45.305 --> 16:47.607
but with power.

16:49.176 --> 16:50.477
TANNER:
 So, the very best thing

16:50.577 --> 16:53.113
about owning your own plane?

16:54.147 --> 16:56.083
Owning your own plane.
(laughter)

16:56.183 --> 16:59.086
Call me. Okay.
(chuckles)

16:59.186 --> 17:02.055
You know, I think I could use
another glass of Chardonnay.

17:02.155 --> 17:03.356
You don't want
another Chardonnay.

17:03.456 --> 17:05.092
Oh, I think I do.

17:05.192 --> 17:06.559
(chuckles)
Uh...

17:06.659 --> 17:10.130
uh, a glass of the 2007
pinot gris for the lovely lady.

17:10.230 --> 17:14.267
Trust me, that Chardonnay
that you're drinking is dreck.

17:14.367 --> 17:17.270
White wine is not supposed
to hit the side.

17:17.369 --> 17:19.205
Let me show you.

17:22.509 --> 17:24.277
Hey, honey!

17:24.377 --> 17:26.445
Wh... Uh, you're early.

17:26.546 --> 17:29.216
I-I wanted everything to be
perfect before you got here.

17:29.316 --> 17:30.483
Well, stop right there.

17:30.583 --> 17:33.253
'Cause guess what I just got
my hands on.

17:33.353 --> 17:35.122
Beyoncé!

17:35.222 --> 17:37.590
Tonight! So maybe
your surprise

17:37.690 --> 17:39.359
can wait till tomorrow?

17:39.459 --> 17:40.627
Wow, Beyoncé?

17:42.162 --> 17:44.231
It's hard to pass
on the Queen B...

17:44.331 --> 17:45.465
It's not hard; it's impossible.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.100
Come on. Let's go!

17:47.200 --> 17:48.568
But my surprise can't wait.

17:49.502 --> 17:52.305
Another time, Sasha Fierce.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.073
So, I'll, um...

17:54.174 --> 17:56.409
I'll pour you some champagne
while I finish up.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.611
Okay.
(chuckles)

17:58.711 --> 18:00.647
(chuckles)

18:06.186 --> 18:07.654
(organ playing)
DASH:
As I now

18:07.754 --> 18:12.325
throw the switch,
the monster shall live!

18:12.425 --> 18:13.393
(crackling)
(audience gasps, shouts)

18:17.264 --> 18:20.099
It's alive!

18:20.200 --> 18:21.334
It's alive!

18:21.434 --> 18:22.702
Ooh!
(laughs)

18:22.802 --> 18:24.704
This is history's greatest
theatrical performance.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.539
DASH:
They doubted me!

18:26.639 --> 18:29.309
They said it couldn't be done,
but I did it!

18:29.409 --> 18:30.643
Why do you keep looking over
at the bar?

18:30.743 --> 18:32.245
Oh, I'm looking for Wade.
If it's okay,

18:32.345 --> 18:33.546
we're gonna grab a beer
after the show.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.148
What?

18:35.248 --> 18:36.616
No, it's not okay.

18:36.716 --> 18:38.251
Well, it was
a rhetorical question.

18:38.351 --> 18:39.419
I wasn't asking permission.

18:39.519 --> 18:40.653
ZOE:
Just trust me,
you don't want

18:40.753 --> 18:42.155
to be friends with Wade.

18:42.255 --> 18:43.456
I dated him-- I should know.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.292
H-He's irresponsible,

18:45.392 --> 18:47.660
annoying and he probably
has an agenda.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.462
What do you think we're gonna
do, repeal Obamacare?

18:49.562 --> 18:51.264
Invade Cuba? It's just a beer.

18:51.364 --> 18:52.632
(quietly):
Hey, lovebirds,

18:52.732 --> 18:54.301
pipe down.

18:54.401 --> 18:56.169
We're trying to
watch the show.
I apologize.

18:56.269 --> 18:57.270
We won't bother you again.

18:57.370 --> 18:58.405
Sorry.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.373
Shh.
DASH:
A dead man's brain

19:00.473 --> 19:04.143
inside of a body I created!

19:04.244 --> 19:05.144
Now alive

19:05.245 --> 19:07.146
or dead!

19:07.247 --> 19:08.448
(phone ringing)

19:08.548 --> 19:09.549
What's ringing?

19:09.649 --> 19:12.485
Why is my monster
ringing?
(organ stops playing)

19:12.585 --> 19:15.288
Whoops! I'm on call.

19:15.388 --> 19:16.489
Don't give me
any dirty looks

19:16.589 --> 19:17.690
'cause any of you could be next.

19:17.790 --> 19:19.158
Just go, just go.
Okay.

19:19.259 --> 19:21.528
(organ resumes playing)

19:21.628 --> 19:23.162
AnnaBeth?

19:23.263 --> 19:25.198
(quietly):
He doesn't want
to go to Beyoncé.

19:25.298 --> 19:27.534
Oh, there's a beautiful table
set with flowers

19:27.634 --> 19:28.601
and a projector.

19:29.469 --> 19:30.470
I think he's going to
show our love

19:31.304 --> 19:32.272
in movie form
before the proposal.

19:32.372 --> 19:33.340
It's so romantic.

19:33.440 --> 19:34.574
It's terrible.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.243
Okay, um, I'm on my way.

19:36.343 --> 19:37.244
Just-just stall him.

19:37.344 --> 19:38.711
(phone beeps)

19:38.811 --> 19:41.414
Hey. Medical emergency.
We have to go.

19:41.514 --> 19:42.649
I need your help.
Uh...

19:42.749 --> 19:44.751
Some people just ain't fit
for the theater.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.786
Sorry.

19:48.321 --> 19:49.789
You guys know a guy
named Wade Kinsella?

19:49.889 --> 19:52.692
Uh, apparently
I'm not allowed.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.494
(Dash yells onstage)

19:54.594 --> 19:56.463
Bert! There you are.

19:56.563 --> 19:58.565
Mother, you s... you scared
the hell out of me.

19:58.665 --> 20:00.800
Tell me, son, how's
the social life?

20:00.900 --> 20:02.735
Found another woman
half your age

20:02.835 --> 20:04.771
in your impressive campaign
to treat the family name

20:04.871 --> 20:07.340
like a spaniel would
a rhododendron?

20:07.440 --> 20:09.208
Grandma, is it possible

20:09.309 --> 20:10.777
that there is another
Tanner Hughes out there?

20:10.877 --> 20:13.680
Because the one that you set me
up with is an insufferable tool.

20:13.780 --> 20:15.214
Well, of course
he is, dear.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.450
He comes from a long
and distinguished line

20:17.550 --> 20:19.218
of insufferable tools.

20:19.319 --> 20:20.453
Well, then why would you...
No, no,

20:20.553 --> 20:21.454
wrong question.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.256
Why did you show

20:23.356 --> 20:25.492
far too much affection
for a creature named Meatball

20:25.592 --> 20:26.626
and then walk away

20:26.726 --> 20:28.227
from the Belles?
Mother,

20:28.328 --> 20:30.430
come on now.
You put the claws back in.

20:30.530 --> 20:34.334
Pretend you're a tree and count
your rings, dear heart.

20:34.434 --> 20:36.669
That tool may be
the last one in the box.

20:36.769 --> 20:38.705
(scoffs)

20:40.807 --> 20:43.776
Now, on to the subject
of the wayward Magnolia...

20:43.876 --> 20:47.380
Excuse me. Uh, George Tucker!
Mother, you remember

20:47.480 --> 20:50.450
your almost-grandson-in-law
George Tucker

20:50.550 --> 20:51.818
who abandoned Lemon
at the altar.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.686
Y'all probably want
to catch up.

20:53.786 --> 20:56.323
(quietly):
I'm sorry, son. Survival.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.696
Between you and me,

21:03.796 --> 21:06.265
I'm crashing
this party.

21:06.366 --> 21:08.301
It is kind of boring.

21:08.401 --> 21:10.403
Truly wish
there was some way

21:10.503 --> 21:13.473
for you and me
to shake things up a bit.

21:13.573 --> 21:15.675
Oh, I'd say you're
doing just fine.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.544
Who? Me?

21:24.684 --> 21:27.554
Now, what about
your current living quarters?

21:27.654 --> 21:28.755
A boat?

21:29.756 --> 21:31.358
What your weekend place
gonna be, an inner tube?

21:32.459 --> 21:33.760
I tell you, they had
such high hopes for you.
(laughs)

21:34.927 --> 21:35.762
Oh. Hey.
Mrs. Breeland, you
remember Crickett, right?

21:36.696 --> 21:37.330
The one that drove
Lemon from the Belles

21:38.164 --> 21:38.197
and blacklisted her
from this party?

21:38.665 --> 21:39.532
Enjoy yourself.

21:39.632 --> 21:40.700
(laughs)

21:40.800 --> 21:42.635
(chuckles)

21:42.735 --> 21:44.604
(chuckles quietly)

21:44.704 --> 21:46.706
So then he started crying,
and he said,

21:46.806 --> 21:48.441
"Oh, I'm two years
from retirement.

21:48.541 --> 21:49.709
Please don't fire me."

21:49.809 --> 21:51.844
I said, "You are 67 years old."

21:51.944 --> 21:53.846
Chardonnay?

21:55.715 --> 21:58.418
Take it.

21:58.518 --> 22:00.687
At least you'll get
to enjoy one thing tonight.

22:03.456 --> 22:05.458
Why do I feel like I know you?

22:05.558 --> 22:07.860
'Cause we met...
yesterday in BlueBell

22:07.960 --> 22:09.762
at a bar called
the Rammer Jammer?

22:09.862 --> 22:11.864
Oh, yeah,
you're the flat tire guy.

22:11.964 --> 22:13.866
Yeah, usually I go by Peter,

22:13.966 --> 22:17.704
but, you know, "flat tire guy"
has a nice ring to it.

22:17.804 --> 22:19.606
I'm Lemon Breeland.

22:19.706 --> 22:21.441
Why are you being
so nice to me?

22:21.541 --> 22:23.810
You're not gonna hand me a
subpoena or something, are you?

22:23.910 --> 22:27.614
Look, I've had my fair share
of disastrous first dates,

22:27.714 --> 22:29.582
so, no, no subpoenas.

22:29.682 --> 22:32.619
I'm just passing through town,
I got a flat tire,

22:32.719 --> 22:33.786
I missed my flight.

22:34.821 --> 22:34.854
Boss says, "Hey, there's
this huge party tonight."

22:35.455 --> 22:36.956
Next thing, I have a mask,

22:37.056 --> 22:38.625
and a chance to talk to a...

22:38.725 --> 22:40.493
TANNER:
Lemon!

22:40.593 --> 22:42.729
Lemon, Alaskan crab cakes!
Come!

22:43.930 --> 22:48.367
A woman on a date
with an insufferable tool.

22:48.468 --> 22:50.637
Wow! But, hey,

22:50.737 --> 22:51.904
at least he's got a plane,
right?

22:52.004 --> 22:53.906
Yeah, and he gets
little balls of foam

22:54.006 --> 22:56.576
in the corner of his mouth
when he talks about it, too.

22:56.676 --> 22:57.744
Hey, I tell you what.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.379
Why don't you tell him
that in the last month,

23:00.480 --> 23:01.514
the resale price

23:02.449 --> 23:03.883
of the Lear jets
have gone down dramatically,

23:03.983 --> 23:05.384
and that they say

23:05.485 --> 23:07.520
it is now the second worst
investment in the world.

23:07.620 --> 23:09.622
Is that true?
I don't know.

23:09.722 --> 23:10.723
It sounds true,
though, doesn't it?

23:10.823 --> 23:12.792
TANNER:
Lemon? Lemon! Come!

23:12.892 --> 23:14.527
Come, come, come, come!

23:14.627 --> 23:16.563
Oh!

23:22.535 --> 23:23.603
Trick or treat!

23:23.703 --> 23:25.772
Zoe, Joel, what
are you doing here?

23:25.872 --> 23:27.807
I thought
there was a medical emergency.

23:27.907 --> 23:28.908
Oh, there is.

23:29.008 --> 23:31.444
I have an acute case
of anxiety

23:31.544 --> 23:34.447
because my best friend and my
boyfriend refuse to be friends.

23:34.547 --> 23:36.916
I'm not leaving until
we fix this once and for all.

23:37.016 --> 23:38.017
(chuckles)

23:38.117 --> 23:39.886
Uh...

23:39.986 --> 23:42.722
Where's my damn alligator
when you need him?

23:42.822 --> 23:44.891
(laughs)

23:44.991 --> 23:46.993
Your thing about the airplanes
totally threw him for a loop.

23:47.093 --> 23:49.796
He's on a phone call right now
with his jet broker.

23:49.896 --> 23:50.963
Does present a little bit
of a pickle,

23:51.063 --> 23:52.799
'cause I'm not
flying commercial.

23:52.899 --> 23:54.734
This is the most fun
I've had all night.

23:54.834 --> 23:56.869
Here, give me some more stuff
to torture him with.
Okay.

23:56.969 --> 23:58.771
Um, let's see.
How about...

23:58.871 --> 23:59.772
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:59.872 --> 24:02.575
So, tell him about
the new intestinal parasites

24:02.675 --> 24:04.577
that they just found
in French wines.

24:04.677 --> 24:05.845
Or, no, even better.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.614
Tell him about
the study that said

24:07.714 --> 24:09.616
that men
that don't wear socks...

24:09.716 --> 24:10.983
What am I paying you for, huh?

24:11.083 --> 24:12.985
...tend to be impotent
by the age of 40.

24:13.085 --> 24:14.453
(laughs)

24:14.554 --> 24:16.589
Or you know what?

24:17.724 --> 24:19.726
Why don't you tell him
that you're leaving

24:19.826 --> 24:21.861
with the man
that you met at the bar

24:21.961 --> 24:24.864
that you already like
20 times more than him.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.937
No, no, I can't...
I can't leave.

24:31.037 --> 24:32.972
My grandma would kill me.

24:35.542 --> 24:36.776
I think I could take her.

24:42.281 --> 24:44.483
Let's slip out the back.

24:52.859 --> 24:55.094
I can't believe they just
barged in here like this.

24:55.194 --> 24:56.829
Whoa, Whoa!
What are you doing?

24:56.929 --> 24:59.065
I was going
to offer our guests some pie.

24:59.165 --> 25:00.867
Mm-mm. Guests are people
you invite over,

25:00.967 --> 25:03.502
not people who show up on
your special night unannounced.

25:03.603 --> 25:04.604
These are home invaders.

25:04.704 --> 25:06.038
They can get
their pie to go.

25:06.138 --> 25:07.840
I thought Halloween
in New York was crazy,

25:07.940 --> 25:08.908
but this is crazy.

25:09.776 --> 25:10.109
This is beyond,
beyond, beyond crazy.

25:10.810 --> 25:11.844
I realize that it's not one of

25:12.679 --> 25:13.813
my five best moments
in life, but...

25:14.947 --> 25:15.748
How is it not okay for me
to grab a beer with Wade,

25:16.749 --> 25:17.550
yet it's perfectly fine
for you to drag me here

25:18.384 --> 25:19.552
under the guise
of a medical emergency

25:19.652 --> 25:20.853
to hang out with Lavon?!

25:20.953 --> 25:22.555
That is an excellent question.

25:22.655 --> 25:23.923
One that I can't answer

25:24.023 --> 25:26.559
in a way
that puts me in a good light.

25:26.659 --> 25:29.128
Look, okay, I realize
that I overstepped.

25:29.228 --> 25:31.130
I can't explain,
but I can

25:31.230 --> 25:32.965
promise that it was for
a good reason.

25:33.065 --> 25:35.067
Joel, would you like
some pie?

25:35.167 --> 25:36.535
Yeah, all right.

25:36.636 --> 25:38.070
Oh, great.
Go ahead, sit down.

25:38.170 --> 25:41.908
Thanks. Thank you for coming,
but this is obviously useless.

25:42.008 --> 25:43.542
I mean, Joel is irritated,

25:44.777 --> 25:45.578
and what's to stop Lavon from
proposing as soon as you leave?

25:46.378 --> 25:47.680
A.B., you underestimate
the powers

25:47.780 --> 25:50.016
of a Johns Hopkins education.

25:50.116 --> 25:54.987
Everybody, think of 40 names
and put them in a jar.

25:55.087 --> 25:57.690
We are playing
Celebrity!

25:57.790 --> 25:59.926
That's 160 names.
That'll take forever.

26:00.026 --> 26:03.062
We are playing
Celebrity!

26:03.162 --> 26:04.563
We are playing Celebrity,

26:04.664 --> 26:06.565
and no one's leaving
until we have fun!

26:06.666 --> 26:07.700
(laughs)

26:07.800 --> 26:09.936
I'll make us some drinks.

26:11.804 --> 26:13.973
LEMON:
So, I had a list made

26:14.073 --> 26:17.076
of the 20 most eligible
bachelors in Alabama.

26:17.176 --> 26:19.578
I dated seven of them.

26:19.679 --> 26:21.914
Uh, two of them
were unbearable,

26:22.014 --> 26:24.050
four of them vanished
as soon as they heard

26:24.150 --> 26:25.718
that I ran a bar.

26:25.818 --> 26:27.854
And, oh, one of them
proposed to me

26:27.954 --> 26:29.622
before we even ordered
our entrees,

26:29.722 --> 26:32.158
and then cried in his French
onion soup when I refused.

26:32.258 --> 26:34.761
My reputation
took a hit.

26:34.861 --> 26:36.763
Well, another hit.

26:36.863 --> 26:39.632
It already had suffered
when I got left at the altar

26:39.732 --> 26:41.167
for having an affair
with the mayor.

26:41.267 --> 26:44.170
Wow. You know, for a
sleepy little town,

26:44.270 --> 26:45.938
BlueBell's got
a lot going on.

26:46.038 --> 26:50.009
I think I'm still trying
to prove to everyone

26:50.109 --> 26:51.944
that I can succeed
on my own two feet.

26:52.044 --> 26:55.214
Which is why
I had Grandma arrange a date

26:55.314 --> 26:56.716
with Tanner Hughes.

26:56.816 --> 26:58.818
Oh.
And his foamy mouth.

26:58.918 --> 27:00.619
Yeah, that makes
perfect sense.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.689
(laughs)

27:02.789 --> 27:04.991
You must think
that I'm a snob.

27:05.091 --> 27:07.026
You know what?
You're right, I probably am.

27:07.126 --> 27:09.762
Well, I don't even like
listening to me right now.

27:09.862 --> 27:11.798
Well, I do.

27:11.898 --> 27:14.033
And besides, I don't
think a snob would run

27:14.133 --> 27:17.636
that amazing establishment
that I met you at yesterday.

27:17.737 --> 27:19.806
I mean, the
Rammer Jammer.

27:19.906 --> 27:23.943
But, hey, you know what I really
did like about that place?

27:24.043 --> 27:25.778
The jukebox.

27:25.878 --> 27:27.113
The way the music
was organized.

27:27.213 --> 27:30.783
It wasn't by, like, song
title or singer or genre.

27:30.883 --> 27:34.186
It was like someone
organized it by... emotion.

27:34.286 --> 27:35.788
That was me.

27:35.888 --> 27:38.024
I did that last week.

27:38.124 --> 27:40.026
Break-up songs,

27:40.126 --> 27:42.061
I-miss-you songs,
I-want-you songs,

27:42.161 --> 27:44.964
I-hate-you songs,
dance-with-me songs,

27:45.064 --> 27:47.800
I-need-a-drink songs.

27:47.900 --> 27:49.936
That's pretty much every song
worth listening to.

27:50.036 --> 27:51.270
That's not a
snob's jukebox.

27:53.305 --> 27:55.274
Well, you're nice.

27:56.308 --> 27:59.946
Hey, you want
to grab a drink?

28:00.046 --> 28:01.948
Yes.

28:02.048 --> 28:04.183
As long as it's not pinot gris.

28:09.922 --> 28:11.858
Hey, Judge Perkins.
Everything okay?

28:11.958 --> 28:13.025
I've been
trying to leave

28:13.125 --> 28:14.193
this place
for 45 minutes,

28:15.161 --> 28:16.695
and it seems that
I've misplaced my wife.

28:16.796 --> 28:17.764
Have you seen her?

28:17.864 --> 28:20.967
Um, I have not, actually.

28:23.235 --> 28:25.037
Uh, yes, I have.
I have seen her.

28:25.137 --> 28:26.839
I saw her.
She was in the garden,

28:26.939 --> 28:27.974
which is out back.

28:28.074 --> 28:29.108
Oh, Lord, I'm gonna have

28:30.042 --> 28:30.910
to pin one of them
GPS thingamabobs on her.

28:31.677 --> 28:32.078
You know
what I mean?
Yeah, yeah.

28:32.711 --> 28:33.245
Yeah, you should do that.

28:33.746 --> 28:35.748
You should... Oh!

28:35.848 --> 28:37.049
Okay, Casanova,
it's time to go.

28:37.149 --> 28:38.250
Oh, what's the rush?

28:38.350 --> 28:40.186
I was just getting
my trick-or-treat on.

28:40.286 --> 28:41.287
Yeah, with Judge Perkins' wife!

28:41.387 --> 28:43.189
She's married to
that old geezer?

28:43.289 --> 28:46.025
No wonder she was looking
for a little sidebar action.

28:46.125 --> 28:47.259
(mutters) Go!

28:47.359 --> 28:48.861
Bertram, there you are.

28:48.961 --> 28:50.729
And this time,
you're not escaping.

28:50.830 --> 28:51.898
We must discuss your...

28:51.998 --> 28:53.132
TANNER:
(clears throat)
Excuse me.

28:53.232 --> 28:54.733
I am sorry to
interrupt, but

28:54.834 --> 28:55.868
Mrs. Breeland,
would you check

28:56.836 --> 28:58.104
to see if Lemon is okay
in the ladies' room?

28:58.204 --> 29:00.272
She said she had a
cinder in her eye

29:00.372 --> 29:01.307
almost an hour ago.

29:01.407 --> 29:02.975
I haven't seen
her since.

29:03.075 --> 29:06.012
I'm gonna go check
the garden... again.

29:08.347 --> 29:09.982
Well, I'm sure that...

29:10.082 --> 29:12.919
No one's had a cinder in
their eye since Atlanta burned.

29:13.019 --> 29:15.154
Your daughter walked out
on her date. Find her.

29:15.254 --> 29:17.156
(sighs)

29:20.126 --> 29:22.161
So, if your car hadn't
have broken down in Mobile

29:22.261 --> 29:23.963
and you wouldn't
have gone to the party,

29:24.063 --> 29:25.131
where would you be right now?

29:25.231 --> 29:27.900
I would be
on a flight to Scotland.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.802
Scotland?
Yeah.

29:29.902 --> 29:32.304
Really?
What, a bagpipe convention?

29:32.404 --> 29:34.907
Or a-a haggis-eating contest.

29:35.007 --> 29:36.308
(both laugh)

29:36.408 --> 29:39.245
You know, sadly,
you're not too far off.

29:39.345 --> 29:40.779
So, I'm a news producer,

29:40.880 --> 29:42.781
and we're covering

29:42.882 --> 29:46.318
the vandalizing
of a beloved statue in Glasgow.

29:46.418 --> 29:47.887
Ah.
Yeah.

29:47.987 --> 29:50.789
I do a lot of cutting-edge
journalism like that.

29:50.890 --> 29:52.791
Yeah, well,
at least you get to travel.

29:52.892 --> 29:54.793
Which is the best part
of the job.

29:54.894 --> 29:57.096
I'm not one to stay
in any place too long.

29:57.196 --> 29:59.031
Is it because
your work makes you happy?

29:59.131 --> 30:00.967
Yeah, happy enough.

30:01.067 --> 30:02.134
What about you?

30:02.234 --> 30:03.870
Oh, no.

30:03.970 --> 30:05.404
No, you've already heard
more about me

30:05.504 --> 30:07.940
than I'd ever imagine telling
a perfect stranger, so...

30:08.040 --> 30:10.042
Oh, see,
that's what makes it fun.

30:10.142 --> 30:11.878
So, come on.

30:11.978 --> 30:14.113
If you could do
anything in the world,

30:14.213 --> 30:15.381
what would it be?

30:15.481 --> 30:18.317
Um... I like being
a business owner.

30:18.417 --> 30:20.152
Although, I spend
way too much time

30:20.252 --> 30:22.054
sorting fish than I'd like.

30:22.154 --> 30:24.223
I still think that I don't know

30:24.323 --> 30:26.825
what I want to be
when I grow up.

30:26.926 --> 30:28.027
Is that crazy?

30:28.127 --> 30:30.396
No. That's endearing.

30:37.036 --> 30:38.237
Okay. Um, hmm.

30:38.337 --> 30:39.371
Oh, uh, this lady--

30:39.471 --> 30:41.974
she might be
on a reality TV show...

30:42.074 --> 30:43.242
Sonia Sotomayor.

30:43.342 --> 30:44.944
Joel, I don't think

30:45.044 --> 30:47.346
the Supreme Court justice
is on a reality TV show!

30:47.446 --> 30:48.380
He didn't mean...
I didn't mean

30:49.248 --> 30:49.916
to imply that you thought
she was on...

30:50.917 --> 30:51.417
I'm not that dumb!
I didn't say you were dumb.

30:52.284 --> 30:52.985
Nuh-uh.
It's just, you know,
sometimes,

30:54.120 --> 30:54.853
in the heat of competition,
you know, you mix people up.

30:55.687 --> 30:55.721
ZOE:
Yes.
You know, like Henry Hill

30:56.322 --> 30:57.189
and Harold Hill.
Mm-hmm.

30:57.856 --> 30:58.424
Goodfellas, Music Man.

30:59.091 --> 30:59.926
It's a very common mistake.

31:00.526 --> 31:01.027
ANNABETH:
And time's up!

31:01.460 --> 31:02.228
Okay, our turn.

31:02.328 --> 31:03.395
Zoe, go.
Okay.

31:03.495 --> 31:04.964
(whooping)
Let's go.

31:05.064 --> 31:06.265
All right, all right.
I didn't... I'm sorry.

31:06.365 --> 31:08.434
Reality TV show,
Supreme Court justice?

31:08.534 --> 31:09.969
Yeah, it means... Okay.
(Zoe whoops)

31:10.069 --> 31:11.170
A.B., I'm ready.
Okay.

31:11.270 --> 31:13.205
All right, it's a Greek word.

31:13.305 --> 31:15.274
It could be a yogurt.

31:15.374 --> 31:18.210
Acidophilus?
Agamemnon? Yoplait?

31:18.310 --> 31:20.146
JOEL and LAVON:
Daenerys from Game of Thrones!

31:20.246 --> 31:21.213
It is A.B.'s turn to guess!

31:22.114 --> 31:22.414
Are you a Game of Thrones fan?

31:22.949 --> 31:24.883
LAVON:
Yeah.
Hey.

31:24.984 --> 31:26.018
Oh, he's obsessed!

31:26.118 --> 31:27.419
He's seen every episode,
read every book.

31:27.519 --> 31:29.055
Joel loves that, too!

31:29.155 --> 31:30.923
Lavon, didn't
you say you that

31:31.023 --> 31:33.292
you had a signed edition
of the first book?

31:33.392 --> 31:34.460
Really? Can I see it?

31:34.560 --> 31:36.028
Yeah, sure.

31:36.128 --> 31:37.463
It's wrapped,
you can't touch the cover.

31:37.563 --> 31:39.031
Well, goes without saying.

31:39.131 --> 31:40.032
Okay.

31:40.132 --> 31:41.033
(doorbell rings)

31:41.867 --> 31:42.901
Oh, finally
some trick-or-treaters.

31:43.802 --> 31:44.536
Who wants to help me
hand out cavities?

31:47.406 --> 31:50.276
Come on, Kendall, don't be shy,
say "Trick or treat."

31:50.376 --> 31:52.444
Trick or treat.

31:53.545 --> 31:55.547
Oh, my, she's...

31:57.416 --> 32:00.219
She's so...

32:00.319 --> 32:02.454
ZOE:
Oh.

32:02.554 --> 32:05.157
I'm sorry,
she just gets

32:05.257 --> 32:07.493
a little emotional
around candy.

32:07.593 --> 32:09.128
Happy Halloween.

32:12.164 --> 32:13.365
Bye.

32:17.036 --> 32:19.972
(crying softly)

32:20.072 --> 32:22.074
A.B., you okay?

32:23.075 --> 32:25.444
Wh-What just happened here?

32:25.544 --> 32:27.479
I-I'm not sure.

32:30.082 --> 32:32.418
Uh, yeah, yeah,
it was, uh, it was me.

32:32.518 --> 32:34.053
I, um...

32:34.153 --> 32:35.487
kind of insulted AnnaBeth.

32:35.587 --> 32:36.288
What?

32:37.489 --> 32:40.092
What'd you say?

32:40.192 --> 32:42.361
Uh, well, you know, I may...
I may have accidentally,

32:42.461 --> 32:45.397
um, implied that she
had, uh, big feet.

32:45.497 --> 32:46.965
I'm so sorry, man.

32:47.066 --> 32:49.035
I have horrible impulse control,
I'm sorry.

32:49.135 --> 32:50.369
Are you kidding me?

32:50.469 --> 32:52.004
Are you kidding me?!

32:56.242 --> 32:58.277
I definitely think
I'm growing on him.

33:07.386 --> 33:09.288
Here's your house, Wade.

33:09.388 --> 33:12.991
(sighs)

33:13.092 --> 33:14.193
Did you fall down, Wade?

33:14.293 --> 33:15.527
Did you... did you
hit your head?

33:15.627 --> 33:16.995
Are-are you
seeing things?

33:17.096 --> 33:19.231
For the millionth time,
Tucker, all right,

33:19.331 --> 33:21.233
I didn't know it was
Judge Perkins' wife.

33:21.333 --> 33:23.102
Well, you knew she
was somebody's wife.

33:23.202 --> 33:25.404
You had to see the big honking
ring right on her finger!

33:25.504 --> 33:27.173
Oh, crap.

33:33.612 --> 33:36.182
That is a large gentleman.
Yes, it is.

33:38.184 --> 33:40.186
You're Wade Kinsella!

33:41.287 --> 33:42.454
Now drive.

33:42.554 --> 33:44.056
Oh, oh.

33:46.458 --> 33:49.428
(horn honks)

33:52.531 --> 33:54.533
Hey.
(crying)

33:56.368 --> 33:59.638
I'm sorry I dragged
you and Joel into this.

33:59.738 --> 34:01.473
Are you okay?

34:03.509 --> 34:05.511
I have dreamed of
Lavon proposing

34:05.611 --> 34:07.346
since the first
time he kissed me,

34:07.446 --> 34:10.516
and I've dreamed
how I'd say yes

34:10.616 --> 34:12.351
and how I'd cry

34:12.451 --> 34:15.587
and how I would tell him I
can't wait to be his wife

34:15.687 --> 34:18.489
and have 19
babies with him.

34:18.590 --> 34:19.491
(sniffles)

34:19.591 --> 34:21.159
I mean, what
if I can't?

34:21.260 --> 34:24.062
You two
will figure it out.

34:24.163 --> 34:27.533
I want babies,
Zoe, with Lavon,

34:27.632 --> 34:31.303
big... football-
playing babies.

34:31.402 --> 34:32.603
I know.

34:32.704 --> 34:36.108
I want that for you, too,
a whole team of 'em.

34:36.208 --> 34:37.476
(laughs)

34:37.576 --> 34:40.411
I really don't want
to have to hurt Joel,

34:40.512 --> 34:42.313
so, Zoe, can you
please take him home?

34:42.414 --> 34:45.184
Maybe AnnaBeth and I can salvage
what's left of this crazy night.

34:46.217 --> 34:49.588
Actually, uh, my
head is feeling

34:49.688 --> 34:51.657
like it's busting open, so

34:51.757 --> 34:54.126
I'm going to have
Zoe take me home, too.

34:56.362 --> 34:58.630
Um... we'll talk tomorrow.

34:58.730 --> 35:01.500
Yeah.

35:09.741 --> 35:11.743
(horn honking in distance)

35:13.279 --> 35:15.247
(whoops)

35:15.347 --> 35:16.248
You lost him.

35:16.348 --> 35:17.316
Damn right I did!

35:17.416 --> 35:19.385
'Cause I didn't want to
get my brains smashed in

35:19.485 --> 35:21.220
next to your stupid
moron brains!

35:21.320 --> 35:23.322
Seriously, Wade, what the
hell is wrong with you, man?

35:23.422 --> 35:24.656
What?

35:24.756 --> 35:26.458
Waiting for you
to slow-dance with me,

35:26.558 --> 35:28.126
I started getting lonely.

35:28.227 --> 35:31.263
Wade, seriously...

35:31.363 --> 35:32.531
what's wrong with you?

35:33.599 --> 35:35.601
I mean, you're-you're
sleeping with married women.

35:35.701 --> 35:37.369
You're sleeping with girls
who got boyfriends

35:37.469 --> 35:38.537
the size of refrigerators.

35:38.637 --> 35:42.174
It's not my finest two days,
I will admit.

35:42.274 --> 35:43.475
(sighs)

35:43.575 --> 35:45.377
You know what I
think it is, man?

35:45.477 --> 35:46.578
I think you are
getting with

35:46.678 --> 35:48.280
every unavailable
woman you can

35:48.380 --> 35:51.583
because the one unavailable
girl you want, you can't have.

35:51.683 --> 35:55.421
Oh, wow, that is...
that is deep, Dr. Freud,

35:55.521 --> 35:58.657
but y-you're wrong--
so, so wrong.

35:58.757 --> 36:00.292
So... let's go

36:00.392 --> 36:03.161
'cause I'm sleeping
at your place tonight.

36:03.262 --> 36:04.330
(clicks tongue)

36:04.430 --> 36:05.731
I should make you
sleep in the truck.

36:05.831 --> 36:08.700
That's what
I should do.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.302
PETER:
This is me.

36:10.402 --> 36:12.238
You know, it's not
as crummy as it looks.

36:12.338 --> 36:13.239
They have
a breakfast buffet.

36:13.339 --> 36:14.240
(chuckles)

36:14.340 --> 36:16.475
I had a wonderful night.

36:16.575 --> 36:18.277
Yeah, me, too.

36:18.377 --> 36:20.412
So, um, do you
have any plans

36:20.512 --> 36:22.581
to be near BlueBell
any time soon?

36:22.681 --> 36:24.316
It's hard to say.

36:24.416 --> 36:26.685
Let's see,
after Glasgow, Vancouver,

36:26.785 --> 36:29.187
then Naples sadly-- Italy.

36:29.288 --> 36:30.322
I mean,
if it was Florida,

36:30.422 --> 36:32.324
I would swing by here
in a heartbeat.

36:32.424 --> 36:34.593
(chuckles)

36:34.693 --> 36:37.396
Well...

36:37.496 --> 36:38.764
I guess it's good-bye.

36:38.864 --> 36:41.199
I got to admit that, uh,

36:41.300 --> 36:43.669
for the first time
in a long while, I...

36:43.769 --> 36:47.239
I wish I could stay
at a crummy hotel longer.

36:55.046 --> 36:57.483
You know,
their breakfast buffet claims

36:57.583 --> 36:59.585
to have the best grits
in Alabama.

37:01.653 --> 37:04.823
You, uh...
you like grits?

37:04.923 --> 37:06.392
Is that an invitation?

37:31.617 --> 37:33.585
(sighs)

37:33.685 --> 37:36.388
Breakfast buffet.

37:39.525 --> 37:41.493
(door opens)

37:41.593 --> 37:43.329
I actually wanted
to leave a note, too.

37:43.429 --> 37:44.763
Uh...
(laughs)

37:44.863 --> 37:48.834
I just... I-I didn't know
what to write

37:48.934 --> 37:50.369
and then I, uh,

37:50.469 --> 37:52.304
I eventually just told
myself, you know, hey,

37:52.404 --> 37:56.308
a breakfast, uh, is worth
a thousand words, so...

37:56.408 --> 37:58.844
Aren't you gonna
miss your flight?

37:58.944 --> 38:02.314
Eh, Europe's been
there for a while.

38:03.649 --> 38:05.917
It can wait a couple
more hours for me.

38:11.890 --> 38:15.661
Okay, yeah, thank you,
thank you so much.

38:15.761 --> 38:16.528
So?

38:16.628 --> 38:18.730
It's a small cyst
on your ovary--

38:18.830 --> 38:21.299
totally common and
totally treatable.

38:21.400 --> 38:22.601
You're fine and ready

38:22.701 --> 38:25.337
to have 19 little
football stars--

38:25.437 --> 38:26.705
running backs,
quarterbacks.
Yay!

38:26.805 --> 38:28.540
A pitcher! Who cares?!

38:28.640 --> 38:29.908
(both laugh)

38:32.844 --> 38:35.313
BRICK:
There you are.

38:35.414 --> 38:36.748
Two creams, no sugar.

38:37.783 --> 38:40.686
Still no word, huh?

38:40.786 --> 38:42.588
At this point,
the best we can hope for

38:42.688 --> 38:44.456
is that Lemon's fallen
down a well.

38:44.556 --> 38:45.757
Now, Mother, Lemon...
LEMON:
Hello.

38:45.857 --> 38:47.459
Morning, Daddy.

38:47.559 --> 38:49.361
Hey.
Grandma.

38:49.461 --> 38:51.930
Is that all you can say?

38:52.030 --> 38:54.433
No.

38:54.533 --> 38:55.767
Also this.

39:06.845 --> 39:08.814
Thank you.

39:08.914 --> 39:10.949
I just had the most...

39:11.049 --> 39:13.619
wonderful night.

39:13.719 --> 39:18.490
And it was exactly,
exactly what I needed,

39:18.590 --> 39:20.426
and it's all
because of you.

39:21.993 --> 39:24.696
Well... who's hungry?

39:35.807 --> 39:39.478
Thank you for helping with
the A.B. situation last night.

39:39.578 --> 39:40.479
I owe you.

39:40.579 --> 39:41.480
You do, and...

39:41.580 --> 39:42.714
Thanks.
Thank you.

39:43.915 --> 39:44.916
Maybe you could start by letting
me choose my own friends?

39:45.016 --> 39:45.917
Okay.

39:46.017 --> 39:46.718
Wade, though?

39:46.818 --> 39:48.887
I mean, does it
have to be Wade?

39:48.987 --> 39:50.422
And this is what I mean.

39:50.522 --> 39:51.823
Oh, hey, Wade.

39:51.923 --> 39:53.592
Kendra, hey.

39:53.692 --> 39:56.595
So, Randall had to
go visit his mama.

39:56.695 --> 39:57.696
Want to come
over tonight?

39:57.796 --> 39:59.965
Uh...

40:00.065 --> 40:02.934
Yeah... no.

40:03.034 --> 40:06.438
You know, I kind of like
having my teeth,

40:06.538 --> 40:07.806
so thanks
for the offer.

40:07.906 --> 40:09.641
(scoffs)

40:09.741 --> 40:12.578
Hey, pal, I'm, uh,
I'm heading down to Pascagoula

40:12.678 --> 40:13.679
to pick up some meat.

40:13.779 --> 40:14.680
You want to come?

40:14.780 --> 40:16.648
Pascagoula?

40:16.748 --> 40:18.850
See, it sounds made up
and yet I know it's real.

40:18.950 --> 40:20.819
Yeah, what
could be better?
All right.

40:20.919 --> 40:22.521
You guys, you
know, have fun.

40:22.621 --> 40:23.555
All right.

40:23.655 --> 40:24.456
ANNABETH:
Anyways,

40:24.556 --> 40:25.824
I'm sorry I got so
upset last night.

40:25.924 --> 40:27.593
It had nothing
to do with Joel.

40:27.693 --> 40:29.528
I was going through
something personal.

40:29.628 --> 40:30.529
Are you okay?

40:30.629 --> 40:31.597
I am. Very.

40:31.697 --> 40:33.599
Very, very, very okay.

40:33.699 --> 40:35.467
So I was thinking
maybe you could do

40:35.567 --> 40:36.968
your special
surprise tonight,

40:37.068 --> 40:40.438
and then, after, we can
celebrate my okayness.

40:40.539 --> 40:44.643
Oh, uh, yeah, I'm sorry, but
the special surprise is off.

40:44.743 --> 40:46.444
What?

40:46.545 --> 40:48.580
How can it be on one
night and then off? Why?

40:48.680 --> 40:50.782
Y-You can't show Night of
 the Living Dead in November.

40:50.882 --> 40:52.584
What?

40:52.684 --> 40:53.985
That was your special surprise?

40:54.085 --> 40:55.554
Yeah, got you, right?

40:55.654 --> 40:57.689
See, you don't think I pay
attention, but I remember

40:57.789 --> 40:58.924
you saying
how you'd never seen

40:59.024 --> 41:00.592
a horror movie before,
so I rented

41:00.692 --> 41:03.562
the original film version and
I set it up with a projector

41:03.662 --> 41:05.797
upstairs on a big
20-foot screen.

41:05.897 --> 41:06.932
Uh-huh.

41:07.032 --> 41:07.966
Zoe!

41:09.568 --> 41:12.003
You know what Lavon's special
surprise was last night?

41:12.103 --> 41:14.540
That we'd watch
 Night of the Living Dead.

41:14.640 --> 41:15.874
(chuckles)
On a big 20-foot screen.

41:15.974 --> 41:17.843
That was what was gonna be

41:17.943 --> 41:19.611
the night that she was gonna
remember forever?

41:19.711 --> 41:21.513
Oh, it's an excellent movie;
and it'd be killer

41:21.613 --> 41:22.514
on a 20-foot screen.

41:22.614 --> 41:23.615
Yeah.

41:23.715 --> 41:25.817
ANNABETH and ZOE:
Men!

41:25.917 --> 41:28.520
ANNABETH:
Can you believe that?
 Night of the Living Dead.

41:31.590 --> 41:33.559
Do you have any idea
what just happened here?

41:33.659 --> 41:35.060
No clue.

41:35.160 --> 41:36.762
Hey, Shakespeare,
you ready to go?

41:37.763 --> 41:40.766
Oh, hey, uh, Lavon,

41:40.866 --> 41:43.034
Wade and I are,
uh, road-tripping

41:43.134 --> 41:45.771
up to a place
called Pascagoula.

41:45.871 --> 41:47.573
You want to come? Might stop
at an old fishing hole,

41:47.673 --> 41:49.107
dig for crawdads.

41:49.207 --> 41:51.109
That's not how
you get crawdads.
Well, sometimes.

41:51.209 --> 41:52.544
LAVON:
Hell yeah.

41:52.644 --> 41:54.813
Count me in.
Let's hit it.
