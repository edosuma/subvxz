WEBVTT

00:00.969 --> 00:04.030
CYRIL: And so, if I could
direct your attention to these

00:04.120 --> 00:06.404
visual aids...
you will see that from our

00:06.406 --> 00:10.208
initial supply of 1,000 kilos of
cocaine, we...

00:10.210 --> 00:12.293
ARCHER: Hang on, dummy, we
had a ton of cocaine.

00:12.295 --> 00:16.097
CYRIL: No, we... Well, we had
a tonne, T-O-N-N-E, also known

00:16.099 --> 00:18.383
as a metric ton, but...
MALORY: (scoffs) Metric.

00:18.385 --> 00:20.385
Who uses metric?
LANA: Every single country on

00:20.387 --> 00:22.387
the planet except for us,
Liberia and Burma.

00:22.389 --> 00:24.188
ARCHER: Wow, really?
LANA: Yup.

00:24.190 --> 00:26.190
ARCHER: 'Cause you never
think of those other two as

00:26.192 --> 00:28.192
having their shit together.
CYRIL: Anyway, as you can

00:28.194 --> 00:29.310
see...
MALORY: Why are they

00:29.312 --> 00:30.611
thermometers?
(Cyril sighs)

00:30.613 --> 00:32.280
PAM: I thought they were
cocks.

00:32.281 --> 00:35.116
ARCHER: Wait, they're not?
CYRIL: No... they... are...

00:35.118 --> 00:38.236
not... cocks!
RON: Okay! Jesus, you people.

00:38.238 --> 00:40.238
Next time, remind me to get shot
in the head.

00:40.240 --> 00:42.240
ARCHER: Uh, Ron, next time,
get shot in the head.

00:42.242 --> 00:44.375
MALORY: Sterling, shut up.
Cyril, continue.

00:44.377 --> 00:47.495
CYRIL (sighs): So, as you can
see, we are already down to 125

00:47.497 --> 00:52.216
kilos of cocaine, which was
worth about $6 million, so...

00:52.218 --> 00:54.218
ARCHER: And, wait, how much
is that in pounds?

00:54.220 --> 00:56.287
CYRIL: Forget pounds!
We're doing kilos!

00:56.289 --> 00:58.139
ARCHER: No, I meant pounds...
MALORY: Sterling!

00:58.141 --> 01:00.291
ARCHER: Exactly.
As in <i>Doctor Who</i> money.

01:00.293 --> 01:02.427
MALORY: How do you stand
there and crack wise when this

01:02.429 --> 01:05.096
is all your fault?
ARCHER: My fault?

01:05.098 --> 01:08.182
I only lost 44.092 pounds of it,
mother.

01:08.184 --> 01:11.436
It's Pam's fault we had to give
the Yakuza 100 kilos.

01:11.438 --> 01:15.106
And this other five-- spoiler
alert-- she ate!

01:15.108 --> 01:17.308
LANA: Yeah, and would now be
a good time to talk about Pam's

01:17.310 --> 01:19.444
cocaine addiction?
PAM: Or the inspiring story

01:19.446 --> 01:23.197
of her heroic struggle to
finally triumph over it?

01:23.199 --> 01:25.366
LANA: What are you eating?
PAM (mouth full): Yogurt!

01:25.368 --> 01:27.318
(grunting)
MALORY: Give me that!

01:27.320 --> 01:29.153
PAM: Hey!
MALORY: Lick it.

01:29.155 --> 01:32.290
ARCHER: (groans) Well, can't
unhear that.

01:32.292 --> 01:35.460
Holy shit, yogurt is amazing!
Why have I never tried yogurt?!

01:35.462 --> 01:38.179
LANA: How have you never
tried yogurt?

01:38.181 --> 01:40.181
ARCHER: Mmm, I didn't know it
was that good.

01:40.183 --> 01:42.183
MALORY: It's good because
it's cocaine!

01:42.185 --> 01:44.335
ARCHER (gasps): Oh, my God.
And little kids eat it?

01:44.337 --> 01:46.337
MALORY: Cyril, you said it
was locked up.

01:46.339 --> 01:48.339
CYRIL: It is.
In the cage in the pantry.

01:48.341 --> 01:50.341
MALORY: Then how did she get
it?

01:50.343 --> 01:51.526
(Pam whistling)

01:51.528 --> 01:58.483
That is it!
You're going to rehab.

01:58.485 --> 02:01.319
PAM: What?! No, I can't!
And you can't make me!

02:01.321 --> 02:03.321
ARCHER: Yeah, is that even
necessary?

02:03.323 --> 02:05.323
I think she's in a pretty good
place.

02:05.325 --> 02:07.325
MALORY: She's going and
that's final, and...

02:07.327 --> 02:09.460
PAM: I swear to God, if you
send me to freakin' rehab, I'll

02:09.461 --> 02:11.462
go right to the cops!
LANA: What?!

02:11.464 --> 02:14.382
ARCHER: Oh, come on.
MALORY: You wouldn't dare.

02:14.384 --> 02:17.218
PAM (laughing): Oh, yeah?!
Just try...

02:17.220 --> 02:20.388
(clang)
LANA: Goddamn, Woodhouse.

02:20.390 --> 02:23.424
WOODHOUSE: Only thing for a
grass, mum.

02:23.426 --> 02:28.688
And, sir, I'm afraid your
breakfast will be four minutes late.

02:28.808 --> 02:30.381
ARCHER (groans): Typical.

03:08.885 --> 03:11.112
ARCHER: What are you doing?
Come on. Tighter.

03:11.352 --> 03:13.352
LANA: Oh, for the... That's
tight enough-- we're not making

03:13.472 --> 03:15.458
tit bondage porn.
ARCHER: That's a thing?

03:15.584 --> 03:17.051
CYRIL: Oh, yeah.
(Malory groans)

03:17.053 --> 03:18.886
ARCHER: Ditto.
I just don't want her to escape.

03:18.888 --> 03:21.538
You know how strong she is.
Might as well be green and

03:21.540 --> 03:23.540
half-deaf.
LANA: What if we move the

03:23.542 --> 03:25.642
coke and lock <i>her</i> in the cage
till she's clean?

03:25.644 --> 03:27.644
ARCHER: Hey, yeah, sweat it
out, like Popeye Doyle.

03:27.646 --> 03:29.563
How long would that take?
LANA: I don't know.

03:29.565 --> 03:31.565
Couple of weeks?
MALORY: Try couple of never.

03:31.567 --> 03:34.551
This is Pam we're talking about,
the poster child for addictive

03:34.553 --> 03:38.572
personality.
What is wrong with you?

03:38.574 --> 03:41.575
ARCHER (crying): I learned it
by watching you.

03:41.577 --> 03:44.661
Oh, my God.
LANA: Yeah, spoiler alert.

03:44.663 --> 03:47.581
So, what do you suggest we do?
MALORY (gasps): We throw her

03:47.583 --> 03:49.917
a party.
With an enormous cake!

03:49.919 --> 03:52.703
Cyril, can we spare another five
pounds of cocaine?

03:52.705 --> 03:55.739
LANA: Malory!
MALORY: 2.27 kilograms, then!

03:55.741 --> 03:57.741
Who are you, Thomas Corwin
Mendenhall?

03:57.743 --> 04:00.511
ARCHER: Right?
LANA: We're not killing Pam!

04:00.513 --> 04:02.513
CHERYL/CAROL: Wait, what?
RON: Jesus. Oh, come on in.

04:02.515 --> 04:04.515
Make some more noise.
CHERYL/CAROL: Just 'cause

04:04.517 --> 04:06.517
now you're the fat one?
LANA: Um, I said we were not

04:06.519 --> 04:08.519
killing her.
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh.

04:08.521 --> 04:10.521
LANA: And, also, this is a
baby.

04:10.523 --> 04:11.855
CHERYL/CAROL: Ew!
LANA: A baby, by the way,

04:11.857 --> 04:14.608
that I did not eat but to which
I will give birth.

04:14.610 --> 04:16.692
CHERYL/CAROL: Ew!
ARCHER (chuckles): Right?

04:16.695 --> 04:18.695
MALORY: Well, if she won't go
to rehab and you won't let her

04:18.697 --> 04:20.863
die with dignity...
LANA: From an overdose of

04:20.866 --> 04:23.534
cocaine cake?!
MALORY: Oh, please.

04:23.536 --> 04:26.620
Change the word "cocaine" to
"Cookie Puss" and that's how her

04:26.622 --> 04:28.622
obituary was going to read
anyway.

04:28.624 --> 04:30.624
LANA: What the...
KRIEGER: I may have a simply

04:30.626 --> 04:32.626
elegant solution.
LANA: Krieger.

04:32.628 --> 04:34.711
KRIEGER: Right?
This place is like a Habitrail--

04:34.713 --> 04:36.914
there are secret passages
everywhere.

04:36.916 --> 04:38.916
CHERYL/CAROL: I think that's
why the colored maids never felt

04:38.918 --> 04:41.802
safe.
They'd be polishing a spittoon

04:41.804 --> 04:43.887
or whatever and suddenly...
Grandpa.

04:43.889 --> 04:45.923
(others gasp)
Yeah. And dressed up like a

04:45.925 --> 04:47.925
ghost?
LANA: What is it with your

04:47.927 --> 04:50.644
family wearing ghost costumes to
scare black people?

04:50.646 --> 04:52.813
CHERYL/CAROL: What is it with
you people making tit bondage

04:52.815 --> 04:56.483
pornos in my ancestral home?!
KRIEGER: Ah, <i>einige</i>

04:56.485 --> 04:58.769
<i>Tittenfreude,</i> huh?
CYRIL: Ooh, <i>ja.</i>

04:58.771 --> 05:00.821
<i>MALORY: So what's all this</i>
<i>about a solution?</i>

05:00.823 --> 05:02.856
<i>KRIEGER: Aha! Yes.</i>
<i>And what is on my finger, you</i>

05:02.858 --> 05:04.858
<i>ask?</i>
<i>LANA: I promise you no one is</i>

05:04.860 --> 05:06.860
<i>asking that.</i>
<i>KRIEGER: Well, they should</i>

05:06.862 --> 05:09.830
<i>because this nearly microscopic,</i>
<i>wittle-bitty guy is my new and</i>

05:09.832 --> 05:12.833
<i>improved mind control chip.</i>
<i>ARCHER: Improved?</i>

05:12.835 --> 05:15.836
<i>On the one that made Len Trexler</i>
<i>think he was a giant lettuce?</i>

05:15.838 --> 05:18.589
<i>MALORY (gasps): Len</i>
<i>Trexler...</i>

05:18.591 --> 05:20.674
<i>RON: Who the hell is Len</i>
<i>Trexler?</i>

05:20.676 --> 05:23.510
<i>MALORY: Never heard of him.</i>
<i>KRIEGER: It's way improved,</i>

05:23.512 --> 05:25.596
<i>and look how tiny.</i>
<i>I don't even need a drill-- I</i>

05:25.598 --> 05:27.664
<i>can inject it right through the</i>
<i>temple.</i>

05:27.666 --> 05:29.666
<i>PAM: Wait, what are we doing?</i>
<i>ARCHER: Stabbing science into</i>

05:29.668 --> 05:31.518
<i>your brain.</i>
<i>PAM: What?!</i>

05:31.520 --> 05:33.520
<i>MALORY: It's for your own</i>
<i>good, dear.</i>

05:33.522 --> 05:35.772
<i>ARCHER: Yeah, so you don't</i>
<i>wind up giving blow jobs in a</i>

05:35.774 --> 05:38.859
<i>bus station toilet.</i>
<i>But for cocaine.</i>

05:38.861 --> 05:41.845
<i>PAM: No! Let me go!</i>
<i>(growling)</i>

05:41.847 --> 05:44.615
<i>MALORY: Krieger, do you think</i>
<i>a chip could cure someone of</i>

05:44.617 --> 05:46.617
<i>stage fright?</i>
<i>CHERYL/CAROL (gasps): No way!</i>

05:46.619 --> 05:47.851
<i>Noop!</i>
<i>MALORY: But you could be</i>

05:47.853 --> 05:49.653
<i>famous.</i>
<i>CHERYL/CAROL: I could be</i>

05:49.655 --> 05:50.854
<i>lettuce!</i>
<i>MALORY: Now, you listen to</i>

05:50.856 --> 05:53.523
<i>me, missy.</i>
<i>You are getting a brain chip,</i>

05:53.525 --> 05:56.543
<i>and then you're going on the</i>
<i>Grand Old Opera, and I don't</i>

05:56.545 --> 05:58.662
<i>care if it kills you be...</i>
<i>(screams)</i>

05:58.664 --> 06:00.664
<i>(Pam roars)</i>
<i>LANA: Pam, honey, just calm</i>

06:00.666 --> 06:02.799
<i>down!</i>
<i>(Pam growls)</i>

06:02.801 --> 06:04.801
<i>MALORY: Somebody do</i>
<i>something!</i>

06:04.803 --> 06:07.838
<i>CYRIL: Nobody do anything!</i>
<i>ARCHER: Lana...</i>

06:07.840 --> 06:09.873
<i>(Pam growls)</i>
<i>Lana!</i>

06:09.875 --> 06:11.875
<i>LANA: Krieger!</i>
<i>KRIEGER: Yeah, I'm on it.</i>

06:11.877 --> 06:14.595
<i>MALORY: Ow!</i>
<i>Idiot.</i>

06:14.597 --> 06:17.814
<i>(Cheryl/Carol screams)</i>
<i>(Pam growls)</i>

06:17.816 --> 06:20.684
<i>LANA: Pam!</i>
<i>ARCHER: Lana...!</i>

06:20.686 --> 06:22.819
<i>CHERYL/CAROL: This is only</i>
<i>somewhat like that old Gypsy</i>

06:22.821 --> 06:28.558
<i>woman said...!</i>
<i>ARCHER: Lana.</i>

06:28.560 --> 06:30.744
<i>LANA: What?!</i>
<i>God shit damn it, Archer, what?!</i>

06:30.746 --> 06:33.614
<i>ARCHER: Um, never mind.</i>
<i>LANA: Archer, I s...</i>

06:33.616 --> 06:35.616
<i>ARCHER: The last thing you</i>
<i>need right now is a big,</i>

06:35.618 --> 06:37.784
<i>shit-eating "I told you so."</i>
<i>(Lana groans)</i>

06:37.786 --> 06:39.903
<i>MALORY: But it's exactly what</i>
<i>you deserve.</i>

06:39.905 --> 06:43.590
<i>And, Krieger, I hope you have a</i>
<i>lot more where this came from</i>

06:43.592 --> 06:45.759
<i>because...</i>
<i>LANA: Super.</i>

06:45.761 --> 06:47.878
<i>Hunting women to force them to</i>
<i>have surgery against their will.</i>

06:47.880 --> 06:49.913
<i>MALORY: It's for Pam's own</i>
<i>good.</i>

06:49.915 --> 06:51.915
<i>She'll die if she doesn't quit</i>
<i>eating cocaine.</i>

06:51.917 --> 06:54.551
<i>LANA: And who's gonna die if</i>
<i>you don't get rich managing</i>

06:54.553 --> 06:56.637
<i>Cheryl's singing career?</i>
<i>MALORY: Maybe you.</i>

06:56.639 --> 06:58.639
<i>Now, get out there and have</i>
<i>some fun!</i>

06:58.641 --> 07:00.641
<i>ARCHER: How could we not?</i>
<i>(Woodhouse clears throat)</i>

07:00.643 --> 07:02.643
<i>Woodhouse, I swear to God, if</i>
<i>you tell me lunch is four</i>

07:02.645 --> 07:04.645
<i>minutes late...</i>
<i>WOODHOUSE: No, sir.</i>

07:04.647 --> 07:08.782
<i>There's a Mr. Holly here.</i>
<i>Sorry, an Agent Holly.</i>

07:08.784 --> 07:12.619
<i>From the FBI.</i>
<i>(others gasp, groan)</i>

07:12.621 --> 07:16.623
<i>ARCHER: But lunch is still</i>
<i>a firm twelve.</i>

07:16.625 --> 07:19.660
<i>(chuckles)</i>
<i>Firm twelve.</i>

07:19.662 --> 07:24.781
<i>You know, as in inches?</i>
<i>Jesus, .3048 meters.</i>

07:24.783 --> 07:27.179
<i>Hi.</i>
<i>Welcome to Nazi Canada!</i>

07:27.299 --> 07:30.787
<i>(gagging sounds)</i>
<i>Eh?</i>

07:34.131 --> 07:37.698
MALORY: Why is the FBI here?
CYRIL: Did he show you a warrant?

07:37.938 --> 07:39.346
WOODHOUSE: No, sir, he...

07:39.466 --> 07:40.946
CYRIL: Then tell him to go
piss off-- he can't come inside

07:40.962 --> 07:42.678
without a warrant.
WOODHOUSE: He...

07:42.680 --> 07:44.160
CYRIL: Well, unless you
invite him in.

07:44.252 --> 07:46.285
ARCHER (groans): He's not a
vampire, idiot.

07:46.287 --> 07:47.503
CYRIL: If...
ARCHER: Plus it's daytime.

07:47.505 --> 07:50.339
CYRIL: If invited in, law
enforcement can enter your home

07:50.341 --> 07:52.375
without a warrant.
Once inside, under the doctrine

07:52.377 --> 07:55.461
of "plain view," anything
illegal-- say, a truckload of

07:55.463 --> 07:58.464
cocaine in the kitchen-- can be
lawfully seized as evidence.

07:58.466 --> 08:01.267
They can also enter a private
residence under any number of

08:01.269 --> 08:03.469
exigent circumstances, like
providing emergency assistance

08:03.471 --> 08:06.338
to an occupant, say, if they
heard someone screaming...

08:06.340 --> 08:08.274
(Malory screams)
(others gasp)

08:08.276 --> 08:11.477
HOLLY: Good morning.
CYRIL: No, sir, good day.

08:11.479 --> 08:14.480
I insist that you leave
immediately, as you have entered

08:14.482 --> 08:17.316
this residence unlawfully.
HOLLY: Uh, you want to jump

08:17.318 --> 08:19.485
in here, Yoda's dad?
WOODHOUSE: I invited him in.

08:19.487 --> 08:21.520
MALORY: Woodhouse!
HOLLY: And once you do that,

08:21.522 --> 08:25.190
you know, we are in.
Not unlike vampires.

08:25.192 --> 08:26.659
ARCHER: See?
CYRIL: What?

08:26.661 --> 08:28.461
MALORY: Be that as it may,
why are you here?

08:28.463 --> 08:30.529
HOLLY: Oh, just checking in,
making sure you folks aren't

08:30.531 --> 08:33.299
engaging in treason, espionage
or anything else illegal.

08:33.301 --> 08:34.583
MALORY: Well, I can assure
you...

08:34.586 --> 08:36.302
HOLLY: Like drugs.
MALORY: Hmm?

08:36.304 --> 08:37.385
HOLLY: Cocaine?
MALORY: Nope.

08:37.388 --> 08:38.721
HOLLY: Yakuza?
MALORY: Mm-mm.

08:38.722 --> 08:40.205
HOLLY: Shootout?
MALORY: Noop.

08:40.207 --> 08:41.640
HOLLY: No one here was shot
by the Yakuza?

08:41.643 --> 08:43.392
MALORY (chuckling): Well, I
think we'd remember that.

08:43.394 --> 08:45.210
HOLLY: Then what's his
problem?

08:45.212 --> 08:46.345
LANA: Vasectomy.
CYRIL: Piles.

08:46.347 --> 08:47.379
ARCHER: Gout.
CYRIL: Mumps.

08:47.381 --> 08:49.232
ARCHER: Goutmumps?
KRIEGER: Progeria! (sniffles)

08:49.234 --> 08:51.350
He's just a little boy.
CYRIL: But whatever <i>is</i> wrong

08:51.352 --> 08:52.401
with him...
ARCHER: Goutmumps.

08:52.403 --> 08:54.403
CYRIL: ...is none of your
business, and since nothing in

08:54.405 --> 08:56.522
plain view would lead a
reasonable person to suspect

08:56.524 --> 08:58.524
illegal activity, I demand that
you...

08:58.526 --> 09:01.410
(Gillette screams)
HOLLY: Nobody move!

09:01.412 --> 09:03.412
MALORY: Well?!
CYRIL (sighs): They can also

09:03.414 --> 09:06.231
do what's known as a...
HOLLY: Protective sweep...!

09:06.233 --> 09:08.400
CYRIL: Case law regarding
search-and-seizure is actually

09:08.402 --> 09:11.370
quite interesting...
MALORY: What... about... the

09:11.372 --> 09:13.372
cocaine?
(Cyril speaking indistinctly)

09:13.374 --> 09:15.374
CYRIL: ...admissible as
evidence but only if he sees

09:15.376 --> 09:17.376
it.
MALORY: So we have to

09:17.378 --> 09:19.462
keep him out of the kitchen.
All right, fan out!

09:19.464 --> 09:21.547
Agent Holly is the prime target,
but...

09:21.549 --> 09:23.549
LANA: So, just so we're
clear, you want us to

09:23.551 --> 09:26.352
tranquilize a federal agent.
MALORY: Do you have a better

09:26.354 --> 09:28.420
idea?
LANA: I do not.

09:28.422 --> 09:30.523
MALORY: Then we just slap
some panties and rouge on him,

09:30.525 --> 09:33.392
pose him with Gillette-- whose
fault this is!-- make some

09:33.394 --> 09:35.394
glossy 8x10s...
KRIEGER: I'll do it!

09:35.396 --> 09:37.396
I have a camera! Dibs!
MALORY: And then I doubt

09:37.398 --> 09:39.398
we'll be hearing from Agent
Holly in the future.

09:39.400 --> 09:41.400
CYRIL: Or you could pose him
with Woodhouse.

09:41.402 --> 09:43.402
WOODHOUSE: What?
KRIEGER (chuckles): God

09:43.404 --> 09:45.404
knows he's a little GILF.
(others groan)

09:45.406 --> 09:47.406
ARCHER: That's a thing?!
CYRIL: How do you not know

09:47.408 --> 09:50.209
the different kinds of porn?
ARCHER: Because I have sex

09:50.211 --> 09:52.495
with actual women, Cyril!
My girlfriend's not equal parts

09:52.497 --> 09:56.582
the Internet, a tube of Kentucky
jelly, self-loathing and a sock!

09:56.584 --> 09:58.584
MALORY: Tell that to your
cellmate!

09:58.586 --> 10:00.586
Now, go!
GILLETTE (slurred): You

10:00.588 --> 10:03.255
scared the shit out of me!
CHERYL/CAROL (groans): What,

10:03.257 --> 10:05.257
literally?
PAM: Seriously, dude, what is

10:05.259 --> 10:07.259
up with you?
GILLETTE (sniffles): I could

10:07.261 --> 10:10.262
walk, and now I can't, and ain't
nobody loves ol' Ray no more.

10:10.264 --> 10:12.264
(crying)
CHERYL/CAROL: Well, yeah,

10:12.266 --> 10:15.434
you're disgusting.
But, you, I am totally digging

10:15.436 --> 10:18.470
this whole Queen Kong vibe.
(Pam growls)

10:18.472 --> 10:21.524
(Gillette sobbing)
HOLLY: My God, are they...

10:21.526 --> 10:24.309
torturing a woman?
Hang on, ma'am!

10:24.311 --> 10:26.362
I'm a federal agent, and I'm
coming!

10:26.364 --> 10:28.447
By God, I am coming!
LANA: Okay, you three head

10:28.449 --> 10:30.616
upstairs...
ARCHER: Hang on.

10:30.618 --> 10:32.618
LANA: I'm going to the
kitchen to make sure he doesn't

10:32.620 --> 10:34.620
stumble onto the coke.
ARCHER: Hang on.

10:34.622 --> 10:36.622
LANA: What?
ARCHER: Question.

10:36.624 --> 10:38.624
LANA: What?
ARCHER: Are we not saying

10:38.626 --> 10:40.626
"phrasing" anymore?
Which, that's fine, whatever,

10:40.628 --> 10:43.495
but if we're doing a new thing
and nobody told me-- that I'd

10:43.497 --> 10:48.184
have a problem with.
HOLLY: Oh, screw me!

10:48.186 --> 10:50.386
ARCHER: Said Ripley to the
android Bishop.

10:50.388 --> 10:54.357
Wait, hang on. Um...
Goddamn it!

10:54.359 --> 10:56.525
What was wrong with "phrasing"?!
GILLETTE: Nothing!

10:56.527 --> 10:59.311
I'm fine.
Just get out, leave me alone!

10:59.313 --> 11:01.480
HOLLY: I just need to be sure
you're not being held here

11:01.482 --> 11:06.235
against your...
That is a federal offense!

11:06.237 --> 11:08.404
GILLETTE: I said, get <i>out...!</i>
<i>KRIEGER: Oh, hey, remind me</i>

11:08.406 --> 11:11.240
<i>to reboot the CPU in Ray's spine</i>
<i>so he can walk again.</i>

11:11.242 --> 11:13.409
<i>CYRIL: What?</i>
<i>A reboot-- that's all it takes?!</i>

11:13.411 --> 11:15.578
<i>KRIEGER: Beep boop.</i>
<i>CYRIL: He's been paralyzed</i>

11:15.580 --> 11:18.247
<i>for months.</i>
<i>What the hell have you been</i>

11:18.249 --> 11:20.416
<i>waiting for?!</i>
<i>KRIEGER: Yeah, but think how</i>

11:20.418 --> 11:22.534
<i>much happier he'll be now.</i>
<i>LANA: Or-- and I'm just</i>

11:22.536 --> 11:25.370
<i>spitballin' here-- I find Holly</i>
<i>first, show him the coke, get</i>

11:25.372 --> 11:29.258
<i>immunity, testify against them,</i>
<i>then you and I go into witness</i>

11:29.260 --> 11:32.595
<i>protection and spend the rest of</i>
<i>our miserable lives on the run,</i>

11:32.597 --> 11:35.380
<i>hounded by the fact that we</i>
<i>betrayed our friends.</i>

11:35.382 --> 11:37.549
<i>Ugh!</i>
<i>Or I get arrested and give birth</i>

11:37.551 --> 11:40.269
<i>in a supermax prison and...</i>
<i>Oh, wait.</i>

11:40.271 --> 11:42.438
<i>Does the baby grow up in prison,</i>
<i>or...?</i>

11:42.440 --> 11:45.608
<i>WOODHOUSE: Oh.</i>
<i>Hello, old friend.</i>

11:45.610 --> 11:48.393
<i>LANA: What the shit, Archer?!</i>
<i>ARCHER: Hang on.</i>

11:48.395 --> 11:50.562
<i>I knew you'd shoot without</i>
<i>looking.</i>

11:50.564 --> 11:53.232
<i>LANA: Oh, really, you know me</i>
<i>that well?!</i>

11:53.234 --> 11:55.234
<i>ARCHER: Uh, well enough to</i>
<i>know you're down here wondering</i>

11:55.236 --> 11:57.336
<i>if witness protection ever sends</i>
<i>people to the Virgin Islands.</i>

11:57.338 --> 11:59.505
<i>LANA: Well, in case you'd</i>
<i>forgotten, I have an unborn</i>

11:59.507 --> 12:02.241
<i>child to think about!</i>
<i>ARCHER: Jesus Christ, Lana,</i>

12:02.243 --> 12:04.409
<i>who can forget?</i>
<i>It's baby this, baby that.</i>

12:04.411 --> 12:07.430
<i>LANA: Aw, Baby Archer, who's</i>
<i>a jeawous baby?</i>

12:07.432 --> 12:09.581
<i>ARCHER: What?!</i>
<i>Holy shit, do you have anemia?</i>

12:09.583 --> 12:12.351
<i>LANA: No, I...</i>
<i>ARCHER: Uh, edema,</i>

12:12.353 --> 12:15.354
<i>hypertension, preeclampsia,</i>
<i>Braxton-Hicks contractions,</i>

12:15.356 --> 12:17.523
<i>pica?!</i>
<i>LANA: I...</i>

12:17.525 --> 12:20.259
<i>ARCHER: GERD?!</i>
<i>Lana, do you have GERD?!</i>

12:20.261 --> 12:22.427
<i>(Lana clears her throat)</i>
<i>LANA: How do you know about</i>

12:22.429 --> 12:24.596
<i>the various possible</i>
<i>complications of pregnancy?</i>

12:24.598 --> 12:27.316
<i>Archer?</i>
<i>ARCHER: Maybe I looked it up.</i>

12:27.318 --> 12:29.485
<i>LANA: Why?</i>
<i>ARCHER: I was concerned about</i>

12:29.487 --> 12:32.271
<i>you.</i>
<i>Blow me!</i>

12:32.273 --> 12:34.439
<i>LANA: Just making sure you're</i>
<i>not into preggo porn.</i>

12:34.441 --> 12:36.608
<i>ARCHER: Oh, goddamn it!</i>
<i>That can't be a thing!</i>

12:36.610 --> 12:39.578
<i>LANA: It is absolutely a</i>
<i>thing, and do you just not have</i>

12:39.580 --> 12:42.331
<i>the Internet, or...?</i>
<i>ARCHER: I have Minitel, okay?</i>

12:42.333 --> 12:45.551
<i>LANA: A: not the Internet,</i>
<i>B: only works in...</i>

12:45.553 --> 12:48.554
<i>ARCHER: France, Lana.</i>
<i>Oui, maintenant je sais!</i>

12:48.556 --> 12:51.390
<i>LANA: Okay, um, thanks for</i>
<i>your concern, and I don't know</i>

12:51.392 --> 12:53.476
<i>what you think you heard about</i>
<i>witness protection, but...</i>

12:53.478 --> 12:56.479
<i>ARCHER: They don't make</i>
<i>babies grow up in prison, Lana.</i>

12:56.481 --> 12:59.231
<i>LANA: Yeah, right?</i>
<i>ARCHER: They take them away</i>

12:59.233 --> 13:01.400
<i>the minute they're born and send</i>
<i>them to an orphanage.</i>

13:01.402 --> 13:03.569
<i>LANA: No, not the minute</i>
<i>they're...</i>

13:03.571 --> 13:06.305
<i>ARCHER: That very minute,</i>
<i>Lana!</i>

13:06.307 --> 13:08.473
<i>They don't even dry them off!</i>
<i>(Lana cries)</i>

13:08.475 --> 13:11.243
<i>So if I were you, I'd run out</i>
<i>that door while I still had a</i>

13:11.245 --> 13:13.412
<i>chance.</i>
<i>LANA: But-but, Archer, I...</i>

13:13.414 --> 13:17.249
<i>ARCHER: I'd also waste five</i>
<i>precious minutes of my head</i>

13:17.251 --> 13:20.485
<i>start in the race to freedom</i>
<i>giving that swell guy Archer a</i>

13:20.487 --> 13:23.255
<i>combination good-bye/thank-you</i>
<i>blow job.</i>

13:23.257 --> 13:28.260
<i>(Lana cries)</i>
<i>(Lana laughs)</i>

13:28.262 --> 13:30.329
<i>LANA: Asshole.</i>
<i>ARCHER: Yeah, or a rim job.</i>

13:30.331 --> 13:32.497
<i>What do you care?</i>
<i>You're never gonna see him</i>

13:32.499 --> 13:35.267
<i>again.</i>
<i>LANA: I can't.</i>

13:35.269 --> 13:37.436
<i>ARCHER: I know.</i>
<i>I was kidding, stupid.</i>

13:37.438 --> 13:39.605
<i>LANA: I mean I can't leave</i>
<i>you, stupid!</i>

13:39.607 --> 13:42.358
<i>(loud knocking)</i>
<i>HOLLY: This is the FBI!</i>

13:42.360 --> 13:46.345
<i>Open this door!</i>
<i>ARCHER: Well, not now...</i>

13:46.347 --> 13:48.447
<i>stupid.</i>
<i>And so, wait.</i>

13:48.449 --> 13:51.200
<i>Where did we land on that</i>
<i>blow job?</i>

13:51.202 --> 13:52.651
<i>Sorry, rim job.</i>

13:55.080 --> 13:57.427
HOLLY: Do you hear me?!
Open this door!

13:58.075 --> 14:01.943
Obstructing... a federal
agent... is a felony...

14:01.945 --> 14:04.079
punishable...
Ow!

14:04.081 --> 14:06.865
...by up to 20 years
imprisonment, if said

14:06.867 --> 14:09.734
obstruction results in the
bodily injury of said agent,

14:09.736 --> 14:12.003
which I think may have just
happened to said agent's-- ow!--

14:12.005 --> 14:14.756
rotator cuff.
Aah!

14:14.758 --> 14:16.925
LANA: 20 years?!
ARCHER: Lana, look at all

14:16.927 --> 14:19.044
that coke!
20 years is just gonna be the

14:19.046 --> 14:21.046
Bac-Os on our prison salad.
Besides, technically, Woodhouse

14:21.048 --> 14:23.765
is the one obstructing.
LANA: Archer!

14:23.767 --> 14:25.767
ARCHER: Relax. They don't
send people that old to prison.

14:25.769 --> 14:27.936
It costs, like, two grand a day
just to keep them alive.

14:27.938 --> 14:30.105
LANA: I'm talking about us!
ARCHER: Hmm. I don't know.

14:30.107 --> 14:32.891
A hundred bucks?
Depends who you ask, Lana.

14:32.893 --> 14:35.060
Liberals say this much,
conservatives say this much...

14:35.062 --> 14:37.112
LANA: So, now you're just
dicking around?

14:37.114 --> 14:39.898
ARCHER: Yes.
LANA: Between the FBI and a

14:39.900 --> 14:41.983
ton of cocaine.
ARCHER: Yes.

14:41.985 --> 14:44.736
LANA: So, can I assume you
have a plan?

14:44.738 --> 14:46.905
ARCHER: Yes.
I mean, I don't, but you can

14:46.907 --> 14:49.074
assu... Ow! Ow!
(Holly grunts)

14:49.076 --> 14:51.826
Ow! Ow! <i>Ow!</i>
<i>(Holly groans)</i>

14:51.828 --> 14:53.995
<i>HOLLY: I'm coming!</i>
<i>ARCHER: Said Ripley to... Ow!</i>

14:53.997 --> 14:56.748
<i>Goddamn it, woman!</i>
<i>CHERYL/CAROL: Come on!</i>

14:56.750 --> 15:00.952
<i>Why are you slowing down?!</i>
<i>PAM: Need... got to...</i>

15:00.954 --> 15:03.722
<i>More cocaine.</i>
<i>CHERYL/CAROL: So, please</i>

15:03.724 --> 15:05.891
<i>don't take this the wrong way--</i>
<i>because I'm loving being your</i>

15:05.893 --> 15:08.059
<i>Esmeralda-- but you may have a</i>
<i>problem.</i>

15:08.061 --> 15:10.795
<i>And it sounds like the solution</i>
<i>is more cocaine, so turn left up</i>

15:10.797 --> 15:12.964
<i>there.</i>
<i>MALORY: But why are you</i>

15:12.966 --> 15:15.734
<i>leaving?</i>
<i>They can't compel a husband and</i>

15:15.736 --> 15:17.903
<i>wife to testify against each</i>
<i>other!</i>

15:17.905 --> 15:20.071
<i>RON: Oh, yeah?</i>
<i>They may not have to compel me.</i>

15:20.073 --> 15:22.807
<i>(Malory gasps)</i>
<i>MALORY: And what is that</i>

15:22.809 --> 15:24.910
<i>supposed to mean?!</i>
<i>RON: Oh, why don't you ask</i>

15:24.912 --> 15:26.978
<i>that guy you never heard of,</i>
<i>Len Trexler?</i>

15:26.980 --> 15:29.748
<i>MALORY: How can I?</i>
<i>I've never heard of him.</i>

15:29.750 --> 15:31.917
<i>RON: You wouldn't know the</i>
<i>truth if it bit you on the ass</i>

15:31.919 --> 15:34.085
<i>and held on, would you?</i>
<i>MALORY: Ron, wait!</i>

15:34.087 --> 15:37.822
<i>RON: What?!</i>
<i>MALORY: Well, if you insist</i>

15:37.824 --> 15:41.710
<i>on being an ass, I can't stop</i>
<i>you, but there is the small</i>

15:41.712 --> 15:43.929
<i>matter of my putting the deed</i>
<i>to my apartment in your name.</i>

15:43.931 --> 15:47.132
<i>(Ron laughs)</i>
<i>RON: Ah, Ah, it's your loss!</i>

15:47.134 --> 15:49.901
<i>I'll mail you your furs.</i>
<i>(Malory gasps)</i>

15:49.903 --> 15:52.771
<i>MALORY: Don't you dare!</i>
<i>At the very least, I insist on a</i>

15:52.773 --> 15:54.940
<i>bonded courier!</i>
<i>Ron?!</i>

15:54.942 --> 15:57.108
<i>(Holly grunts)</i>
<i>ARCHER: Ow!</i>

15:57.110 --> 15:59.844
<i>Lana, cut it... Ow! Ow!</i>
<i>(Holly groans)</i>

15:59.846 --> 16:01.947
<i>ARCHER: Ow! Ow!</i>
<i>HOLLY: What's this door made</i>

16:01.949 --> 16:04.115
<i>out of, mithril?</i>
<i>ARCHER: Ow!</i>

16:04.117 --> 16:06.785
<i>LANA: Just once, why can't</i>
<i>you take...</i>

16:06.787 --> 16:08.853
<i>ARCHER: Ow!</i>
<i>LANA: ...anything seriously</i>

16:08.855 --> 16:10.956
<i>just once?</i>
<i>ARCHER: Ow! I was serious</i>

16:10.958 --> 16:13.124
<i>about that rim jo... Ow!</i>
<i>Seriously, please stop hitting</i>

16:13.126 --> 16:15.860
<i>me.</i>
<i>What the...?</i>

16:15.862 --> 16:18.029
<i>CYRIL: Oh, thank God!</i>
<i>LANA: Cyril? Wait.</i>

16:18.031 --> 16:20.165
<i>How did you...?</i>
<i>KRIEGER: This house is</i>

16:20.167 --> 16:22.867
<i>insane.</i>
<i>CYRIL: And scary, and gross,</i>

16:22.869 --> 16:24.936
<i>and I'm pretty sure I smelled a</i>
<i>skeleton.</i>

16:24.938 --> 16:26.938
<i>KRIEGER: No, you definitely</i>
<i>smelled a skeleton.</i>

16:26.940 --> 16:28.940
<i>LANA: Well, this is great!</i>
<i>CYRIL: How?!</i>

16:28.942 --> 16:30.942
<i>I inhaled skeleton!</i>
<i>LANA: Because now the coke...</i>

16:30.944 --> 16:32.944
<i>(loud sounds of eating)</i>
<i>...is getting eaten by Pam!</i>

16:32.946 --> 16:35.046
<i>Quick, make the wall spin around</i>
<i>again!</i>

16:35.048 --> 16:37.115
<i>CYRIL: It just kind of spun</i>
<i>by itself!</i>

<i>ARCHER: Jesus Christ, have</i>
<i>you people never even heard of</i>

16:39.119 --> 16:41.820
<i>Scooby-Doo?</i>
<i>KRIEGER: Oh, come on!</i>

16:41.822 --> 16:43.989
<i>LANA: Of course.</i>
<i>CHERYL/CAROL: Uh... Pam?</i>

16:43.991 --> 16:46.825
<i>(Pam roaring)</i>
<i>PAM: Aw, crap.</i>

16:46.827 --> 16:54.816
<i>(Pam grunting)</i>
<i>(Cheryl/Carol laughing loudly)</i>

16:54.818 --> 16:56.985
<i>(gasps, sad roar)</i>
<i>ARCHER (laughing): Oh, my</i>

16:56.987 --> 16:59.137
<i>God.</i>
<i>That's so freakin' unsafe.</i>

16:59.139 --> 17:01.823
<i>LANA: Okay, Krieger, Cyril,</i>
<i>get in there, and we'll spin you</i>

17:01.825 --> 17:03.825
<i>back around. Archer...</i>
<i>CYRIL: Why do I have to go</i>

17:03.827 --> 17:05.910
<i>back in there?!</i>
<i>LANA: Because I said so!</i>

17:05.912 --> 17:08.079
<i>KRIEGER: Yeah, plus</i>
<i>skeletons?</i>

17:08.080 --> 17:10.832
<i>LANA: Archer?</i>
<i>ARCHER: Got it.</i>

17:10.834 --> 17:12.916
<i>LANA: Oh! Goddamn it!</i>
<i>KRIEGER: Ooh!</i>

17:12.919 --> 17:15.086
<i>CYRIL: Goddamn it.</i>
<i>ARCHER: Godspeed, you</i>

17:15.088 --> 17:17.155
<i>meddling kids.</i>
<i>WOODHOUSE (moaning): And sir,</i>

17:17.156 --> 17:19.156
<i>I'm afraid your breakfast will</i>
<i>be four minutes late.</i>

17:19.159 --> 17:21.843
<i>ARCHER: Yeah, duh.</i>
<i>I already berated you.</i>

17:21.845 --> 17:23.928
<i>LANA: Woodhouse, get away</i>
<i>from the door!</i>

17:23.930 --> 17:26.013
<i>WOODHOUSE: Hmm? Oh!</i>
<i>HOLLY: Goddamn it!</i>

17:26.016 --> 17:27.999
<i>Just what do you people think</i>
<i>the letters FBI stand for?</i>

17:28.001 --> 17:29.968
<i>ARCHER: I bought a T-shirt</i>
<i>once where it stood for "Female</i>

17:29.970 --> 17:32.053
<i>Body Inspector."</i>
<i>God, is Myrtle Beach not the</i>

17:32.055 --> 17:34.139
<i>best?</i>
<i>HOLLY: Pull a stunt like this</i>

17:34.141 --> 17:37.008
<i>again, you'll never make it back</i>
<i>to Myrtle Beach.</i>

17:37.010 --> 17:39.144
<i>ARCHER: I probably wasn't</i>
<i>going to anyway.</i>

17:39.146 --> 17:41.730
<i>Turns out it's actually not the</i>
<i>best.</i>

17:41.732 --> 17:43.848
<i>LANA: And you actually have</i>
<i>no right to search this house.</i>

17:43.850 --> 17:46.017
<i>As you can see, there's nothing</i>
<i>illegal going on.</i>

17:46.019 --> 17:48.820
<i>HOLLY: Maybe not now, but I</i>
<i>know you still have a lot of</i>

17:48.822 --> 17:51.022
<i>international contacts from your</i>
<i>ISIS days.</i>

17:51.024 --> 17:53.792
<i>Mexico, Colombia, the Orient.</i>
<i>I bet it wouldn't be too hard to</i>

17:53.794 --> 17:55.960
<i>get set up in the drug trade.</i>
<i>ARCHER (laughing): Well,</i>

17:55.962 --> 17:58.129
<i>you'd be surp... Oh!</i>
<i>LANA: We're not drug dealers,</i>

17:58.131 --> 18:01.049
<i>Agent Holly.</i>
<i>HOLLY: Good, because I'll be</i>

18:01.051 --> 18:06.004
<i>watching you... like a hawk</i>
<i>that's been bred with an eagle</i>

18:06.006 --> 18:10.058
<i>to produce some sort of...</i>
<i>eagle-eyed superhawk... with a</i>

18:10.060 --> 18:11.843
<i>badge.</i>

18:11.845 --> 18:18.983
<i>LANA: So, am I crazy, or is</i>
<i>he super weird?</i>

18:18.985 --> 18:22.854
<i>ARCHER: Oh, well, I'm torn,</i>
<i>Lana, I really am.</i>

18:22.856 --> 18:25.824
<i>I want to say "both," but I also</i>
<i>don't want you to stop my heart</i>

18:25.826 --> 18:28.059
<i>again, so...</i>
<i>LANA: Who's da widdle baby?</i>

18:28.061 --> 18:30.829
<i>Who's da widdle baby?</i>
<i>Who's da widdle baby?</i>

18:30.831 --> 18:33.765
<i>Yes, he is, widdle, little baby!</i>
<i>CYRIL: Wait. The brain chip</i>

18:33.767 --> 18:35.934
<i>is in there?</i>
<i>KRIEGER: I told you it was</i>

18:35.936 --> 18:38.103
<i>small.</i>
<i>CYRIL: Said Ripley to the...</i>

18:38.105 --> 18:40.805
<i>No, doesn't work there.</i>
<i>KRIEGER: Yeah, it's crap.</i>

18:40.807 --> 18:43.708
<i>Okay, I actually only have one</i>
<i>brain chip, so... who's our</i>

18:43.710 --> 18:46.044
<i>lucky winner?</i>
<i>CYRIL: Hmm. I guess we have</i>

18:46.046 --> 18:48.880
<i>to decide if we want regular</i>
<i>lame Cheryl and a Pam who's not</i>

18:48.882 --> 18:52.050
<i>gonna overdose on cocaine and</i>
<i>die, or potentially famous</i>

18:52.052 --> 18:55.053
<i>country singer Cheryl and a Pam</i>
<i>who... tits.</i>

18:55.055 --> 18:59.791
<i>KRIEGER: Flip a coin?</i>
<i>CYRIL: No.</i>

18:59.793 --> 19:01.960
<i>LANA: And, yeah, he's a</i>
<i>weirdo, but I think Agent</i>

19:01.962 --> 19:04.729
<i>Holly's right.</i>
<i>We do have a lot of</i>

19:04.731 --> 19:06.831
<i>international connections.</i>
<i>ARCHER: So, I'm thinking I</i>

19:06.833 --> 19:09.033
<i>should take a trip down old</i>
<i>Mexico way, maybe Colombia, or</i>

19:09.035 --> 19:13.071
<i>even Southeast Asia, or...</i>
<i>Hey, where's Ron?</i>

19:13.073 --> 19:15.840
<i>MALORY: Never heard of him.</i>
<i>LANA: Um...</i>

19:15.842 --> 19:18.009
<i>ARCHER: Lana, let it go.</i>
<i>Jesus.</i>

19:18.011 --> 19:20.745
<i>MALORY: But maybe we should</i>
<i>try to sell out to an</i>

19:20.747 --> 19:24.816
<i>international cartel.</i>
<i>But let me be clear.</i>

19:24.818 --> 19:26.985
<i>You won't be gallivanting around</i>
<i>under the pretense of work just</i>

19:26.987 --> 19:29.721
<i>to visit the fleshpots of the</i>
<i>world.</i>

19:29.723 --> 19:31.890
<i>This isn't ISIS.</i>
<i>ARCHER: No, I...</i>

19:31.892 --> 19:34.058
<i>MALORY: And it definitely</i>
<i>isn't your semester abroad.</i>

19:34.060 --> 19:36.828
<i>ARCHER: What?!</i>
<i>Come on, that's...</i>

19:36.830 --> 19:38.963
<i>Hey, I don't think we need to go</i>
<i>into all the...</i>

19:38.965 --> 19:41.733
<i>MALORY: Cobra whiskey and</i>
<i>ladyboys. I mean...</i>

19:41.735 --> 19:43.902
<i>LANA: Ha!</i>
<i>ARCHER: Shut up.</i>

19:43.904 --> 19:46.070
<i>MALORY: You shut up!</i>
<i>And Krieger?</i>

19:46.072 --> 19:48.740
<i>I trust the brain-chip implant</i>
<i>was a success?</i>

19:48.742 --> 19:50.842
<i>KRIEGER: I think. I mean,</i>
<i>it's in there, and she's alive.</i>

19:50.844 --> 19:54.813
<i>Now we just have to see if t</i>
<i>were any adverse side effects.</i>

19:54.815 --> 19:58.116
<i>(loud yawning)</i>
<i>LANA: Uh... Cheryl?</i>

19:58.118 --> 20:00.885
<i>CHERYL/CAROL: Nah, Cheryl's</i>
<i>gone.</i>

20:00.887 --> 20:04.856
<i>I'm Cherlene now.</i>
<i>And if somebody don't fry me six</i>

20:04.858 --> 20:07.926
<i>goddamn eggs and some Carolina</i>
<i>fries, I would personally be</i>

20:07.928 --> 20:10.588
<i>shocked-- shocked, I tell you--</i>
<i>if by mornin' this place ain't</i>

20:10.708 --> 20:15.779
<i>burnt to the ground.</i>
<i>(loud yawning)</i>

20:19.605 --> 20:21.840
<i>KRIEGER: And I'm not a</i>
<i>doctor, but...</i>

20:21.842 --> 20:26.408
<i>I mean, I'm definitely a doctor,</i>
<i>so... no, I think we're good.</i>

20:26.528 --> 20:28.114
<i>Yup, yup, yup.</i>
