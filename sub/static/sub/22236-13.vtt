00:00.601 --> 00:03.140
How about some music to cheer us up?

00:03.141 --> 00:05.199
<i>♪ Water, fire, earth and air... ♪</i>

00:05.200 --> 00:07.849
I cast a spell
to make Oscar walk again.

00:07.850 --> 00:10.543
I didn't know that it would unmake
all of us as well.

00:10.603 --> 00:13.543
This is my sister, Alice.
Ten years ago, Alice disappeared.

00:13.603 --> 00:16.833
I know she was working on a spell
and I think something went wrong.

00:16.834 --> 00:19.820
That's the connection,
and this is our way home.

00:20.104 --> 00:21.435
Hey, guys?

00:21.436 --> 00:23.185
The other boys
are the other Elements!

00:23.186 --> 00:25.226
- Why us?
- Because you have potential.

00:25.227 --> 00:26.967
- Potential for what?
- Magic.

00:27.139 --> 00:29.802
Something's missing.
Oscar is the Fifth Element!

00:29.803 --> 00:32.183
Oscar is the reason
the spell was cast.

00:32.243 --> 00:34.791
He is the connection
between our world and your world.

00:34.792 --> 00:36.662
I need your spirit
to make this talisman work.

00:36.663 --> 00:37.770
Why me?

00:37.771 --> 00:39.726
Because in another world,
you're my brother.

00:40.215 --> 00:42.562
Divinity of the Elements,
I summon thee.

00:42.563 --> 00:46.663
Bates is possessed by a demon
and he's trying to kill Felix.

00:47.604 --> 00:48.749
No, Oscar!

00:48.750 --> 00:50.803
- Oscar was helping Bates?
- Hey!

00:50.804 --> 00:53.144
The demon has learnt to possess
more than one body.

00:53.145 --> 00:55.399
Help! Help!

Season 1, Episode 13

01:44.912 --> 01:47.912
Synced by Reef
www.addic7ed.com

01:55.043 --> 01:59.223
So, Police and Rescue
have searched here,

01:59.283 --> 02:01.743
here, and here,
where the caves are.

02:01.803 --> 02:03.543
Then let's look there again.

02:03.544 --> 02:06.444
Well, we know for certain
they were in there at some stage.

02:06.445 --> 02:08.919
Right, well, let's move out
in an ever-widening circle,

02:08.919 --> 02:11.818
- ...from where the backpack was found.
- Andy's backpack.

02:11.963 --> 02:16.185
I'll bring caving equipment. We can
re-search all the old mine shafts too.

02:16.223 --> 02:17.763
That's a good idea.

02:19.416 --> 02:23.518
Look, I'll be the last searcher
to leave this forest, but...

02:24.494 --> 02:26.438
It's been 11 days now.

02:27.564 --> 02:30.503
Andy was obsessed with that
survivalist Bear, uh...

02:30.504 --> 02:31.782
Grylls.

02:31.783 --> 02:34.075
I'm sure he would have picked up
salient information.

02:34.076 --> 02:36.279
Sam knows a lot about surviving
in the wilderness.

02:36.280 --> 02:39.220
And Felix. He's a tough kid
and he's been through a lot.

02:40.890 --> 02:43.119
Let's go and find our boys.

03:00.858 --> 03:04.050
Bates, what are you doing?

03:05.883 --> 03:07.383
Help!

03:09.171 --> 03:11.645
A wand and a mug?

03:11.729 --> 03:13.869
Chalice. Good, that too.

03:13.929 --> 03:17.668
But hang on,
so, Felix did a magic spell

03:17.669 --> 03:21.807
which brought you to our world,
but none of you were ever born?

03:21.808 --> 03:24.149
I know, it doesn't make
any rational sense.

03:24.150 --> 03:25.648
It sounds pretty crazy.

03:25.649 --> 03:27.922
How do you think we know
all those things about you...

03:27.923 --> 03:30.899
- Like your crush on Robert Pattinson?
- He's mine.

03:30.900 --> 03:32.131
What else do we need?

03:32.132 --> 03:39.076
Dried snake skins, bat wings, toad
tongue, and sage and chilli powder.

03:39.077 --> 03:42.400
So, if this mad story
really is true,

03:42.401 --> 03:45.089
why has Felix been kidnapped
by a demon?

03:45.090 --> 03:49.088
It's a restoring demon, meant
to restore order by any means necessary.

03:49.089 --> 03:51.709
- Will incense help?
- Uh, no.

03:51.769 --> 03:57.189
So, if the demon kills Felix,
then the magic spell dies with him?

03:57.190 --> 03:58.600
Ellen!

03:58.717 --> 04:00.338
Does that mean we get to go home?

04:00.339 --> 04:05.039
Uh, possibly, or you might just
vanish into nothingness. Poof!

04:05.649 --> 04:09.848
- What are you getting at, Sam?
- Felix tricked us, and lied to us!

04:09.849 --> 04:13.389
Felix deserves to be punished,
but not by human sacrifice.

04:13.449 --> 04:15.719
Look, Bates may be a pain,

04:16.071 --> 04:18.349
but I don't want my mum
married to a killer.

04:18.409 --> 04:20.149
Yeah, I guess so.

04:20.536 --> 04:22.265
Bring all that.

04:23.051 --> 04:24.631
We're ready.

04:26.246 --> 04:29.335
Alright, so, where is Bates
taking Felix?

04:29.491 --> 04:31.958
Restoring demons
are creatures of habit.

04:31.959 --> 04:34.364
The forest! That's where
the wormhole appeared.

04:34.365 --> 04:37.669
- And that's where Alice cast her spell.
- And where Roland attacked us!

04:55.951 --> 04:57.447
Jake!

04:58.210 --> 05:02.070
Oh, hey. I went to come visit you
at the hospital, but you were gone.

05:02.209 --> 05:05.829
Fully recovered. The doctors can't
explain what happened.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.480
Did we go out in your world?

05:07.481 --> 05:10.637
Unfortunately, in my world,
I kind of disgust you.

05:10.689 --> 05:12.216
I don't believe that!

05:12.217 --> 05:14.601
You're a goth,
and Felix is your best friend.

05:14.602 --> 05:16.182
Now I really don't believe it.

05:18.097 --> 05:21.229
When you see the other me,
show her this.

05:21.289 --> 05:22.869
It belonged to my nan.

05:23.601 --> 05:27.109
- Thanks.
- Most boys are such morons.

05:27.169 --> 05:30.909
When I finally fall for one, he turns
out to be from another dimension.

05:30.910 --> 05:32.343
Typical.

05:40.907 --> 05:44.207
- You left me this, didn't you?
- Yep.

05:45.079 --> 05:47.499
How do you know
I love dolphins?

05:48.902 --> 05:50.562
Who are you, Jake?

05:51.099 --> 05:54.460
Look, this might sound
a little crazy,

05:54.461 --> 05:57.172
but, well, just imagine
a world where...

05:57.173 --> 06:00.909
You and Gary had that kid
when you were teenagers.

06:01.560 --> 06:04.761
How do you know about that?
Did Gary put you up to this?

06:04.762 --> 06:08.131
Gary didn't say a word.
I know this, because...

06:10.769 --> 06:14.373
Well, just imagine what that kid
would look like now.

06:20.484 --> 06:24.115
He'd be a teenage boy,
just like you.

06:26.340 --> 06:29.948
When I get home, I'm gonna be
an awesome boyfriend to you.

06:30.807 --> 06:35.409
Except you won't be you -
or at least, not <i>this</i> you.

06:35.731 --> 06:38.861
'Cause here we're just getting
to know each other.

06:39.652 --> 06:43.962
Well, future ex-boyfriend,
it's been great to know you.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.949
That demon isn't gonna fight itself.

06:55.117 --> 06:56.737
Bye, Mum.

06:58.157 --> 06:59.790
Bye, Jakie.

07:08.198 --> 07:10.058
Oscar!

07:17.642 --> 07:22.702
Pull over to the side of the road!
This is the police, Sgt Riles!

07:23.730 --> 07:26.989
Repeat, pull over
to the side of the road.

07:58.362 --> 08:00.102
Be quiet!

08:11.698 --> 08:14.990
- Why didn't you stop?
- I didn't feel like it.

08:14.991 --> 08:17.134
Bates, have you been drinking?

08:17.485 --> 08:18.978
Help!

08:18.979 --> 08:20.999
- Who's that?
- Just a bag of flesh.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.240
- Let me out, please!
- Alright, out of the car!

08:23.241 --> 08:26.181
- Both of you! Move it!
- Watch out, Sgt Riles!

08:34.166 --> 08:36.734
Stay there!
Don't make me draw my weapon!

08:36.849 --> 08:40.443
Mate, we've got trouble,
the road to the Bremin Forest.

08:40.443 --> 08:42.730
- Sgt Riles!
- Can you hear me?

08:59.881 --> 09:01.421
Chase?

09:02.837 --> 09:04.457
Chase.

09:35.820 --> 09:37.139
Roland!

09:39.493 --> 09:40.906
Roland!

09:45.566 --> 09:48.026
You really know
how to freak someone out, man!

09:48.027 --> 09:51.660
Can't I get a moment's peace
in this forest? Come on.

10:09.067 --> 10:12.417
Guys, what are we actually
gonna do in the forest?

10:12.418 --> 10:14.426
Well, we're not going on a picnic.

10:14.427 --> 10:16.660
We're off to fight a demon
who wants to kill us.

10:16.661 --> 10:19.956
- It wants to kill Felix.
- But if we get in the way?

10:24.085 --> 10:26.452
Andy, have you got a spell
that'll make us invisible?

10:26.453 --> 10:29.389
I'm looking! Hopefully the right
spell to disarm the demon.

10:29.390 --> 10:30.970
Do you even know
what you're looking for?

10:30.971 --> 10:33.031
He's the Brainiac dude!
He'll find it.

10:33.356 --> 10:34.866
No pressure, yeah.

10:34.867 --> 10:38.387
- Wrong. Pressure.
- Heaps of pressure.

10:45.210 --> 10:46.888
It's all my fault.

10:47.269 --> 10:51.330
I was trying to help Oscar, but
I just ruined everything, for everyone.

10:53.920 --> 10:56.180
I should let the demon
do its job.

10:57.682 --> 10:59.294
Here I am!

11:00.081 --> 11:01.982
Come get me!

11:03.880 --> 11:06.065
I'm not afraid of you anymore!

11:07.760 --> 11:10.872
Listen, there is weird, like me,

11:10.873 --> 11:13.460
and there is plain stupid
like you are being now.

11:13.465 --> 11:16.503
- I deserve to die...
- Oh, stop with the theatrics!

11:16.535 --> 11:18.275
Now, that place in the forest,

11:18.276 --> 11:21.376
this isn't the first time something
like this has happened there.

11:23.249 --> 11:25.281
The big question is...

11:25.495 --> 11:27.557
Can you fix it?

11:31.861 --> 11:35.500
If I can make this work,
I think I can use it to get us home.

11:35.501 --> 11:36.826
I think I've fixed it.

11:36.827 --> 11:39.592
That sounds like a plan.
And I'll help you.

11:39.911 --> 11:43.007
Yes, but it won't dispel the demon
without the others around.

11:43.008 --> 11:45.546
Well, that's part two of the plan,
then, isn't it?

11:45.547 --> 11:47.547
Come on, let's go find them.

11:47.548 --> 11:49.846
- Let's not.
- Back off!

11:51.681 --> 11:54.481
What - we're supposed to be scared
of this little tyke?

11:59.238 --> 12:03.025
Our powers are evolving,
Felix. You have no hope.

12:03.026 --> 12:05.514
Go find the others
before it possess you too.

12:05.515 --> 12:06.766
Run!

12:08.207 --> 12:11.086
Fight it, Oscar!
Fight it!

12:11.087 --> 12:13.307
Is that the best you can do?

12:28.202 --> 12:31.114
Dad must have caught up
to them, but...

12:34.418 --> 12:36.278
...Which way did they go?

12:38.282 --> 12:41.795
- Let's use magic to find them.
- Seriously?

12:44.102 --> 12:46.303
So, are those all spells?

12:46.304 --> 12:48.789
There must be some kind
of tracking spell in here.

12:48.790 --> 12:50.687
If Felix can work it out,
I'm sure I can.

12:50.688 --> 12:53.884
It's not a matter of working it out,
Andy. It's in you or it's not.

12:53.885 --> 12:55.963
I mean, I tried for years
and not a biscuit.

12:55.964 --> 12:59.233
I'm sure it's in me!
Felix said we had potential.

13:03.293 --> 13:05.737
When you're scared
and your path is blocked,

13:05.738 --> 13:07.625
all you have to do is knock.

13:07.657 --> 13:10.938
- Sounds like a nursery rhyme.
- Or a <i>self-help</i> book.

13:11.660 --> 13:14.877
Hear my chant, hear my spell,

13:14.878 --> 13:19.058
spirit from the other side,
in this time that we now dwell,

13:19.059 --> 13:21.399
take us across the great divide!

13:22.161 --> 13:24.429
Or we could do it
the old-fashioned way.

13:25.130 --> 13:28.635
Got my tracking badge in Scouts.
Come on, this way.

13:28.851 --> 13:31.937
We gonna walk,
or you gonna summon a magic carpet?

13:31.938 --> 13:33.127
"Ha, ha."

14:11.948 --> 14:15.928
What are you doing?!
What do you want from me?!

14:16.886 --> 14:18.466
Help!

14:22.512 --> 14:25.092
That way!

14:25.126 --> 14:27.381
If we're looking for the altar,
it's up that way!

14:27.382 --> 14:29.282
But the twister came from that way!

14:29.496 --> 14:30.916
Alice was here.

14:32.638 --> 14:34.634
We've seen signs like this before.

14:39.378 --> 14:40.888
It's starting.

14:42.636 --> 14:45.944
- Come on, this way!
- You better be right.

14:52.545 --> 14:53.867
Wait!

14:56.037 --> 15:01.010
Water, Fire, Earth, and Air,
Elements that we all share!

15:03.454 --> 15:08.402
Water, Fire, Earth, and Air,
Elements that we all share!

15:18.850 --> 15:22.136
- The demon!
- No, no, it's me - Roland.

15:22.137 --> 15:23.717
Whoa, dude, you scared us!

15:23.763 --> 15:26.190
- Have you seen Felix?
- There!

15:37.156 --> 15:41.329
Soon the disturbance will be gone.
The troubles will be over.

15:41.330 --> 15:44.788
- Will my friends return home?
- All the troubles will be gone.

15:44.789 --> 15:46.609
They've got nothing to do with this!

15:46.610 --> 15:50.302
- You think this is just you.
- It IS just me, I swear it!

15:50.303 --> 15:53.863
- I'm the one with the magic.
- It was never just you.

15:57.551 --> 15:59.839
Soon order will be restored.

16:01.075 --> 16:04.063
It's activated.
The guys must be here!

16:04.075 --> 16:05.744
Phoebe!

16:15.954 --> 16:17.121
Oscar!

16:17.547 --> 16:20.168
- Oscar!
- Felix, what's happening?

16:20.169 --> 16:22.906
Get me out of here!
Untie me!

16:28.192 --> 16:30.933
- They've got Roland!
- I don't feel too good.

16:30.934 --> 16:33.674
Oh, great, you just swapped
Roland for Oscar!

16:34.220 --> 16:36.320
Restore order!

16:39.767 --> 16:41.850
Oscar! Oscar!

16:41.851 --> 16:43.136
Are you ready?

16:43.726 --> 16:45.184
Sorry, Dad.

16:48.968 --> 16:50.293
Sam!

16:52.845 --> 16:56.783
Water, Fire, Earth, and Air,
Elements that we all share!

16:56.796 --> 17:00.816
Water, Fire, Earth, and Air,
Elements that we all share!

17:00.817 --> 17:04.436
Quick! They're getting weaker!
The spell's working!

17:05.377 --> 17:08.465
Hurry, Andy!
I need my bag!

17:11.719 --> 17:13.299
- What now?
- My phone!

17:13.300 --> 17:15.654
I must have dropped it!
You wanna make a call...

17:15.655 --> 17:16.762
Just look for it!

17:16.763 --> 17:17.992
Phoebe!

17:18.291 --> 17:19.444
Alice!

17:19.445 --> 17:21.954
Order must be restored!

17:22.162 --> 17:24.830
Order must be restored!

17:24.832 --> 17:28.871
The talisman's losing power!
They're fighting back!

17:29.737 --> 17:31.133
I'll look for it!

17:31.134 --> 17:33.394
The original unmaking spell
is on my phone.

17:33.395 --> 17:35.958
If we cast it again,
it'll unmake itself.

17:35.959 --> 17:38.139
Everything will go back
to the way it was.

17:38.332 --> 17:39.632
Found it!

17:43.055 --> 17:45.513
- It's Alice!
- Alice is the demon?

17:45.514 --> 17:46.810
Yes!

17:46.811 --> 17:49.311
Keep the demons
away from Andy!

17:51.741 --> 17:53.639
Protect Andy!

18:04.446 --> 18:06.645
It's working,
but it's not strong enough!

18:07.615 --> 18:10.235
We need to make it stronger!

18:10.835 --> 18:14.122
We need to do it together!
Sing with me!

What happened?

19:00.503 --> 19:02.931
- Where's Phoebe?
- Where's Oscar?

19:03.952 --> 19:05.840
Where are <i>we?</i>

19:08.819 --> 19:10.414
There they are!

19:10.870 --> 19:12.422
Let's attack!

19:12.717 --> 19:14.534
Seriously?

19:16.953 --> 19:18.573
Wait, wait!

19:21.252 --> 19:24.752
- It's loser dad!
- Are you sure?

19:24.765 --> 19:28.361
Look at the clothes he's wearing,
it's totally loser dad! Awesome!

19:28.455 --> 19:31.309
- We're home!
- They're here!

19:32.771 --> 19:34.471
- Whoo!
- They're here!

19:37.406 --> 19:38.730
Andy!

19:39.271 --> 19:40.410
Andy!

19:40.411 --> 19:42.454
- You're alive!
- I'm sorry, I meant...

19:42.455 --> 19:44.355
Come here!

19:45.144 --> 19:50.666
Um, I'm so sorry
for what I put you through, Sam.

19:50.667 --> 19:53.767
It's OK.
We're home. Freak!

19:54.468 --> 19:56.195
You can call me freak.

19:56.196 --> 19:58.805
Don't worry, dude.
It's just the beginning.

19:59.490 --> 20:01.150
- Sam!
- Felix!

20:01.151 --> 20:02.567
- Dad!
- Sam!

20:02.568 --> 20:03.988
- Dad!
- Hey!

20:07.500 --> 20:08.624
Dad...

20:08.893 --> 20:10.619
- You OK?
- Yeah.

20:16.414 --> 20:19.433
So, what did you eat
and where did you sleep?

20:19.434 --> 20:21.939
Can I tell you tomorrow?
I'm so beat.

20:21.940 --> 20:23.642
Just as long as you don't leave
anything out.

20:23.643 --> 20:27.110
- I'll tell you everything.
- Don't go away again.

20:28.485 --> 20:32.145
I can't believe you dumped me
for a jock, a nerd, and a moron!

20:32.146 --> 20:34.922
I know -
wrong on so many levels...

20:35.031 --> 20:38.155
- But I missed you.
- Missed you too.

20:38.215 --> 20:41.315
No, I really missed you.

20:41.375 --> 20:43.515
Here you are.
You must be starved.

20:44.058 --> 20:50.622
I am so, so, so, so, so, so glad
to have you home.

20:50.815 --> 20:52.555
How glad, Mum?

20:52.993 --> 20:57.337
I am so, so glad,
that I made you...

20:57.791 --> 21:00.916
Your favourite for our picnic.

21:01.175 --> 21:03.595
- BLT.
- What else?

21:03.655 --> 21:05.644
Awesome, Mum.

21:05.683 --> 21:07.475
So, your teacher...

21:07.535 --> 21:11.863
Mr Bates dropped in to see me a few times
while you were gone. He's a lovely man.

21:13.379 --> 21:16.755
- Bates?
- Mmm, forgot the mayo!

21:17.286 --> 21:18.929
Wait there, I'll be back.

21:18.930 --> 21:20.870
Yeah, you two attacked me,

21:20.871 --> 21:24.253
and when I tried to talk to you,
Mum, you just had a panic attack.

21:24.254 --> 21:26.644
Goodness sake, what a story!

21:26.645 --> 21:30.921
Oh, and Mia had this new boyfriend named
Sammy, who was like what I used to be

21:30.922 --> 21:32.193
A moron?

21:33.323 --> 21:37.303
And Ellen, that goth chick,
she was your best friend.

21:37.304 --> 21:38.510
She hates me.

21:38.545 --> 21:40.782
Here, sweetheart,
let me serve you.

21:40.783 --> 21:42.846
- Thanks, Mum.
- Looks great, Mum.

21:44.125 --> 21:46.225
- Hey, Sam?
- Hmm?

21:46.226 --> 21:47.846
Could we have
a little talk later?

21:47.847 --> 21:50.490
Yeah, sure.
Is everything OK?

21:50.491 --> 21:52.675
Can somebody
give me a hand, please?

21:57.627 --> 22:01.095
You must have missed
your grandmother's food.

22:01.335 --> 22:03.435
Not so much as you would think.

22:03.495 --> 22:05.835
Everyone's talking about you
at school.

22:05.836 --> 22:08.576
- Really?
- 'What's the nerd done now?'

22:11.823 --> 22:13.483
Are you alright, Mum?

22:14.255 --> 22:18.995
When they found the food that we packed
and your poncho on the walking track...

22:21.603 --> 22:23.039
I thought...

22:26.512 --> 22:28.374
It's all OK now, honey.

22:30.144 --> 22:34.085
Ay, ay, dirty hands,
you wash clean?

22:41.557 --> 22:44.861
Right, well, that thing's cactus.
Going to get some matches.

22:44.895 --> 22:46.395
Oh! I'll try.

22:46.455 --> 22:48.395
Bless you.

22:48.455 --> 22:50.475
God, hayfever must be
early this year.

22:50.785 --> 22:52.649
Do you want me to get
your antihistamines?

22:52.650 --> 22:53.875
Yeah, I'll help, Osky.

22:53.876 --> 22:56.136
Now, where'd I put them?
It's alright, love.

22:57.258 --> 22:59.711
- I think they're in your handbag.
- Are they?

23:29.900 --> 23:31.440
Bates...?

23:52.427 --> 23:54.703
This is where it all began.

23:57.734 --> 23:59.394
I know.

24:01.413 --> 24:04.442
Except the magic shop wasn't
locked up when I went missing.

24:04.715 --> 24:06.941
I've only been gone two weeks.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.148
It's not over yet.

24:09.641 --> 24:11.329
How do you know that?

24:11.535 --> 24:15.475
Because something's happening.
I can feel it.

24:19.691 --> 24:21.471
She's here.
