WEBVTT

00:00.860 --> 00:04.296
- Previously on Being Human...

00:04.330 --> 00:06.560
We have too much to do
in too little time

00:06.600 --> 00:08.898
to lay waste to
the one strength we have.

00:08.940 --> 00:10.465
That goes for the weakest...

00:12.380 --> 00:14.075
that goes for
the mistakes.

00:14.110 --> 00:17.000
- Is it totally crazy town

00:17.050 --> 00:18.848
to pursue a relationship with
someone when you're both dead?

00:18.880 --> 00:20.848
- None of us should be
in relationships.

00:20.880 --> 00:21.950
-Ohm yG LA od!

00:21.980 --> 00:23.015
(Screaming)

00:23.050 --> 00:24.279
Ah!

00:26.360 --> 00:28.658
- Aidan! Rebecca fixed me!

00:28.690 --> 00:30.226
- You can't turn a kid!

00:30.260 --> 00:31.421
- I did this for you.

00:31.460 --> 00:34.293
- That is why
we don't turn children.

00:36.130 --> 00:39.395
- I have news from Boston.
May I see them?

00:45.610 --> 00:48.272
- (Bishop): Immortality
is an easy thing

00:48.310 --> 00:49.709
to take for granted.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.969
You figure:
You've got forever.

00:52.010 --> 00:54.809
What's a little mistake
here and there?

00:54.850 --> 00:57.387
But that's the thing
about forever.

00:57.420 --> 01:01.015
The choices you make,
the people you lose,

01:01.060 --> 01:03.427
your mistakes are indelible,

01:03.460 --> 01:07.294
with no sweet death
to erase your own memory.

01:11.270 --> 01:13.864
(Garage door opening)

01:13.900 --> 01:16.335
(* Man singing folk rock *)

01:31.650 --> 01:34.483
You may think the greatest
reward of eternal life

01:34.520 --> 01:37.023
is the power it gives you.

01:39.230 --> 01:41.426
You're untouchable.

01:51.610 --> 01:54.079
- Whatever's going on with you,
stow it!

01:54.110 --> 01:55.669
- I'm fine.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.475
- You're brooding
over your girl

01:58.510 --> 02:00.274
when we have business
to attend to.

02:00.320 --> 02:03.950
And the Dutch will smell
every inch of her human stink

02:03.990 --> 02:05.014
all over you.

02:05.050 --> 02:06.552
(Laughing)

02:06.590 --> 02:09.116
- Will you give me
a hand, please?

02:10.389 --> 02:11.653
What do you want
me to say?

02:11.690 --> 02:13.556
It's a relationship.
It's complicated.

02:13.600 --> 02:14.897
- It's ridiculous.

02:14.930 --> 02:16.819
- Don't expect
you to understand.

02:16.870 --> 02:19.931
- That you've lost your mind?
Excuse me for not understanding!

02:19.970 --> 02:23.304
You think they'll
understand, huh?

02:23.340 --> 02:26.059
Being shunned for a human?

02:26.110 --> 02:27.635
You think they'll care?

02:27.680 --> 02:30.001
Bishop, we don't even know
why they're here,

02:30.050 --> 02:32.178
and you wanna step out!

02:32.220 --> 02:35.576
What? To go courting? Now?

02:35.620 --> 02:37.839
- She's pulling away
from me, Aidan.

02:37.890 --> 02:39.255
I can feel it.

02:41.790 --> 02:43.588
- So?

02:43.630 --> 02:45.086
- So...

02:50.330 --> 02:51.991
- You know what?

02:52.700 --> 02:53.963
Just go.

02:56.770 --> 02:58.829
- Carlo, I gotta go.

03:00.310 --> 03:01.380
- Where?

03:02.610 --> 03:04.999
- Better you go now
before they wake up.

03:12.420 --> 03:13.581
(Door opening)

03:13.620 --> 03:15.281
- The power is a perk,

03:15.320 --> 03:19.723
something to make your endless
passing days more bearable.

03:19.760 --> 03:21.899
But to rule the world alone...

03:23.100 --> 03:24.625
is worthless.

03:35.610 --> 03:37.408
(Rebecca screaming)

03:37.450 --> 03:38.975
- Listen to me! Listen!

03:39.010 --> 03:43.618
He was out of control! It is
impossible for a child that young

03:43.650 --> 03:45.379
to control what this is!

03:45.420 --> 03:48.720
- So you couldn't teach him
like you said you'd teach me?

03:48.760 --> 03:49.727
I believed you!

03:49.760 --> 03:51.580
- I know!
- Bernie believed you!

03:51.630 --> 03:53.155
- I know! I hate myself!

03:53.200 --> 03:56.261
Enough for both of us.
Listen to me. Bernie...

03:57.600 --> 03:59.125
(Breathing heavily)

04:02.070 --> 04:05.665
But when you've been alive
for as long as I have,

04:05.710 --> 04:08.680
you begin to
understand or see.

04:11.110 --> 04:15.718
- He was the closest thing
I'll ever have to a son.

04:16.920 --> 04:19.218
The closest thing...

04:19.250 --> 04:21.958
I'll ever have to
sharing my blood.

04:25.830 --> 04:27.093
- I'm sorry.

04:34.770 --> 04:36.363
(Exhales)

04:36.410 --> 04:37.707
- Your son...

04:39.040 --> 04:41.077
Were you there
when he died,

04:41.110 --> 04:42.475
like you were with Bernie?

04:42.510 --> 04:44.046
- Don't ever talk about my son!

04:44.080 --> 04:45.809
- Hey!

04:46.820 --> 04:49.539
Take your situation elsewhere.

04:50.620 --> 04:51.781
They'll be awake soon.

04:51.820 --> 04:53.117
- Who?

04:54.660 --> 04:56.355
- Hegeman and the others.

04:56.390 --> 04:58.222
- Um, the...

04:58.260 --> 04:59.796
The Dutch are here?

04:59.830 --> 05:01.992
- Who the hell are the Dutch?

05:02.030 --> 05:04.397
- Listen. Shh! The Dutch,
they are our elders.

05:04.430 --> 05:06.262
They originate from
the Netherlands.

05:06.300 --> 05:07.597
They hide in Amish country

05:07.640 --> 05:10.530
because it's the closest thing
to an orthodox lifestyle

05:10.570 --> 05:11.537
that they can find.

05:11.570 --> 05:13.607
Hey, you need to be careful!

05:13.640 --> 05:14.835
The Dutch are intense.

05:14.880 --> 05:16.905
It doesn't matter
how many there are.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.247
Even if there's a few,

05:18.280 --> 05:21.045
a whisper from them sends
a trigger to Pennsylvania,

05:21.080 --> 05:23.287
to the families in
Chicago and New York.

05:23.320 --> 05:25.812
- I don't need protection!

05:25.850 --> 05:28.785
Especially from you!

05:38.900 --> 05:40.459
- Yes, well, shall we?

05:40.500 --> 05:42.832
- I'm not staying here!

05:45.010 --> 05:47.638
Look, Bishop, I'm not a member
of this family anymore.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.546
I don't have to put on
a show for them.

05:49.580 --> 05:50.843
- Hmm.

05:50.880 --> 05:52.143
I see.

05:52.180 --> 05:54.478
You're sure
you don't wanna stay?

05:54.520 --> 05:58.184
Tell Hegeman in person
how you suck on hospital bags

05:58.220 --> 05:59.654
and live with a werewolf?

05:59.690 --> 06:03.024
"Cause he just loves to hear
updates on modern customs.

06:03.060 --> 06:04.721
- He doesn't need to know...

06:04.760 --> 06:06.649
Hegeman doesn't care about me.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.156
- Oh, on the contrary,
my friend.

06:08.200 --> 06:09.827
You're the great warrior.

06:09.870 --> 06:16.264
I understand your wish to be
free of us, but I'm good that way.

06:16.300 --> 06:18.940
Hegeman is 1,010.
He's old-fashioned.

06:18.970 --> 06:23.840
To him, the way you live ils an
insult to _ the empire they've built.

06:33.760 --> 06:37.185
- Are you husking corn
for your lady?

06:37.230 --> 06:38.880
I love it!

06:38.930 --> 06:42.230
Are you also making pie?
Because you should.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.560
Oh wow! Are you trying to
look like a douche?

06:47.600 --> 06:50.103
- I'm trying not to
look like a crazy person

06:50.140 --> 06:51.608
talking to myself.

06:51.640 --> 06:53.972
- Oh, smart!

06:54.010 --> 06:56.900
So, what time are you
going over to Nora's?

06:56.950 --> 06:57.974
- Half hour.

06:58.010 --> 07:01.139
I figure a daytime barbeque
should be safe.

07:01.180 --> 07:05.219
- Oh... right, right.
Full moon tonight.

07:07.190 --> 07:08.817
How are you pulling this off?

07:08.860 --> 07:12.251
- I'm barely pulling it off.

07:12.290 --> 07:15.749
She just gets that
some things are private.

07:17.670 --> 07:18.796
You know?

07:20.340 --> 07:24.732
I feel almost like a person
when I'm with her.

07:24.770 --> 07:26.169
- Yeah.

07:26.210 --> 07:27.473
Must be nice.

07:30.350 --> 07:32.739
- I'm sorry things
didn't work out with Nick.

07:32.780 --> 07:34.441
- Ah...

07:34.480 --> 07:36.585
I'm not sad
about Nick per se.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.417
Would've gotten messy.

07:39.450 --> 07:41.009
Soggy.

07:41.060 --> 07:43.449
But at least,

07:43.490 --> 07:45.754
for a little while there,

07:45.790 --> 07:46.951
I felt solid...

07:48.130 --> 07:50.292
like I had a semi-real life.

07:51.900 --> 07:53.994
I was a part of something.

07:57.370 --> 08:00.101
- You're a part
of something here.

08:00.140 --> 08:01.869
- I'm not.
- You are.

08:01.910 --> 08:04.880
- You guys go off and live
your crazy monster lives,

08:04.910 --> 08:07.379
and I barely have
any idea what's going on.

08:07.420 --> 08:10.879
And sometimes what's going on
is dark and awful

08:10.920 --> 08:13.560
and I can't do anything
to help you.

08:13.590 --> 08:15.684
- You do things!

08:15.720 --> 08:18.326
Hey, you remember that time

08:18.360 --> 08:21.557
that you totally
freaked Nora out?

08:21.600 --> 08:23.329
- Unintentionally!

08:23.370 --> 08:26.362
I want intention!
I want impact!

08:26.400 --> 08:28.391
I want corn!

08:31.410 --> 08:33.879
- It just gets stuck
in your teeth.

08:36.710 --> 08:38.576
All right.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.371
I'll be right back.

08:47.590 --> 08:51.322
(Car door slams,
tires screech)

08:53.100 --> 08:54.750
- Josh?

08:56.200 --> 08:58.089
Josh?

09:05.670 --> 09:07.229
(Sighs)

09:07.280 --> 09:09.601
- I feel silly eating alone.

09:09.650 --> 09:12.073
Can't you at least pretend
to want a sandwich?

09:13.450 --> 09:17.842
- I'm sorry, I don't mean to
stare. I just love looking at you.

09:19.620 --> 09:23.625
- I suppose it must be nice
to be the way you are,

09:23.660 --> 09:25.321
not to want anything.

09:25.360 --> 09:26.794
- That's not true.

09:26.830 --> 09:28.958
I need you.

09:32.400 --> 09:33.470
Give me a kiss.

09:33.500 --> 09:34.535
(Giggles)

09:36.170 --> 09:37.660
- Mm-mmm.

09:37.710 --> 09:39.030
- What?

09:40.040 --> 09:41.201
What's the matter?

09:41.240 --> 09:43.846
- It's my birthday next week.
- I know.

09:43.880 --> 09:45.644
We're going to Vermont!

09:45.680 --> 09:47.375
(Siren in distance)

09:49.280 --> 09:51.749
- I just keep getting older.

09:51.790 --> 09:53.588
- We talked about this, dear.

09:55.390 --> 09:58.121
It doesn't have to be this way.
I can change that.

09:58.160 --> 09:59.696
- I don't want you to.
- I want--

09:59.730 --> 10:02.119
- I can't do that.
- I want this to last forever.

10:03.670 --> 10:05.092
- It's not natural.

10:06.100 --> 10:08.398
We'd be cheating God.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.235
My shift is starting.

10:17.350 --> 10:18.704
We'll talk later.

10:33.660 --> 10:36.698
(Whistles)
- Hope she's worth it.

10:38.700 --> 10:39.997
Just turn her.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.361
Then you can be
together forever

10:43.410 --> 10:45.799
<i>in a normal relationship,</i>

10:45.840 --> 10:47.308
not this...

10:47.340 --> 10:48.978
whatever this is.

10:49.010 --> 10:51.809
Did I mention she's human?

10:51.850 --> 10:54.547
- You don't think
I've tried to convince her?

10:54.580 --> 10:57.982
- Then you need to move on.
Carrying on with a human you can't turn

10:58.020 --> 11:00.682
spits in the face
of our people.

11:00.720 --> 11:02.927
- One day you'll
understand, Aidan.

11:02.960 --> 11:06.021
I respect her. I...

11:06.060 --> 11:07.858
I respect her humanity.

11:10.530 --> 11:11.895
- Well...

11:12.970 --> 11:14.131
(Exhales)

11:14.170 --> 11:15.934
I've been sent for you.

11:15.970 --> 11:18.507
Carlo wants us to
entertain them.

11:21.140 --> 11:23.302
Think about what
this looks like, man,

11:23.350 --> 11:25.170
to Hegeman,
to the rest of them.

11:27.620 --> 11:29.349
- What? They're not
gonna miss me.

11:29.380 --> 11:31.212
It's Carlo
they're sniffing around.

11:31.250 --> 11:33.150
- Oh, so you abandon him?

11:33.190 --> 11:35.613
Huh? Now?

11:35.660 --> 11:39.688
God! Your family
needs you now.

11:44.770 --> 11:46.067
(Sighs)

11:46.100 --> 11:49.365
(Church bells clanging)

11:52.810 --> 11:54.403
Just do it.

11:55.810 --> 11:58.074
She'll thank you in the end.

12:16.930 --> 12:18.420
(Cell ringing)

12:18.470 --> 12:20.564
* Hey, sexy *

12:21.840 --> 12:24.263
* Hey, hey, hey, sexy *

12:36.580 --> 12:38.241
- Hegeman.

12:44.090 --> 12:45.888
- Drink.

12:53.700 --> 12:55.361
(Clears throat)

13:00.240 --> 13:03.642
- The last 50 years have been
kind to you, old friend.

13:03.680 --> 13:07.810
Obviously, the rural life
is treating you well.

13:07.850 --> 13:09.773
(Grunts)

13:22.230 --> 13:23.595
(Exhales)

13:23.630 --> 13:25.189
- Ugh...

13:25.230 --> 13:28.029
- They can be
a little brutish.

13:28.070 --> 13:30.061
(Josh grunting)

13:31.770 --> 13:33.829
(Breathing heavily)

13:34.810 --> 13:36.471
- What the hell is this?

13:36.510 --> 13:39.775
- My name is Douglas.
What's your name?

13:41.550 --> 13:42.915
- No...

13:44.090 --> 13:45.683
No! No!

13:46.960 --> 13:48.189
No! You...

13:48.220 --> 13:50.382
You tell me
what's going on here!

13:50.430 --> 13:52.524
You tell me what's
going on here!

13:52.560 --> 13:54.426
I was home.
I was doing things.

13:54.460 --> 13:55.757
And then...

13:58.670 --> 14:00.365
No, you tell me
what this is!

14:00.400 --> 14:01.959
Tell me what this is!

14:02.000 --> 14:03.729
- You're a werewolf, son.

14:04.740 --> 14:06.367
For them, this is sport.

14:07.910 --> 14:08.900
- Vampires?

14:08.940 --> 14:10.647
- Of course.

14:12.180 --> 14:14.478
They call me the Professor.

14:15.850 --> 14:17.113
- Well, that's nice.

14:17.150 --> 14:19.346
You've been down here
for a while.

14:19.390 --> 14:21.882
You've got yourself
a little nickname.

14:21.920 --> 14:22.921
Who's...

14:22.960 --> 14:25.258
Would you let me
out of here?

14:25.290 --> 14:27.224
Let me out!

14:27.260 --> 14:28.728
- It doesn't matter.

14:28.760 --> 14:31.923
We're in the bowels
of their little empire.

14:31.970 --> 14:34.337
They're faster, stronger...

14:36.100 --> 14:37.659
until tonight, that is.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.269
Tonight, you turn.

14:39.310 --> 14:41.108
- Yes, I know.

14:41.140 --> 14:45.407
And I would like to not do it
down here with you, sir.

14:45.450 --> 14:47.612
- That's why they've
brought you here.

14:48.750 --> 14:51.481
It's a dogfight, son.

14:51.520 --> 14:55.855
The moon gets high,
they watch you turn.

14:55.890 --> 15:00.225
They drool over your tortures.

15:01.900 --> 15:05.063
They bet money on
who will rip who to shreds.

15:06.370 --> 15:08.099
- You're serious?

15:09.100 --> 15:11.102
- The winner keeps fighting,

15:11.140 --> 15:13.973
trapped the other
29 days of the month.

15:16.540 --> 15:18.599
- And the loser?

15:20.180 --> 15:22.171
- The loser dies.

15:25.920 --> 15:27.979
- So, where's the other guy?

15:28.020 --> 15:31.354
They keep him locked
in an isolation room

15:31.390 --> 15:34.052
with a piece of raw meat
or something?

15:34.100 --> 15:37.229
- For the last 15 years,
they've kept me here.

15:50.710 --> 15:51.905
- You painted.

15:51.950 --> 15:53.247
- Uh, yes.

15:53.280 --> 15:54.873
Um, 8?

15:54.920 --> 15:56.012
- Ten.

15:56.050 --> 15:57.814
- Ten. Ten years ago.

15:57.850 --> 15:58.817
Yes. It...

15:58.850 --> 16:01.979
Our clients find it
more soothing.

16:02.020 --> 16:06.059
- And you find your clients
soothing, as well.

16:06.090 --> 16:08.525
- It's a business.
It funds what we need.

16:08.560 --> 16:10.119
- To comingle
with humans?

16:10.170 --> 16:13.196
To pretend you care about
their dearly departed's death?

16:13.240 --> 16:16.596
I would have hoped you'd
done away with this little charade.

16:16.640 --> 16:18.039
- And live on a farm?

16:18.070 --> 16:20.209
- Be what you are.

16:21.240 --> 16:23.846
- Brother, it was
decided long ago,

16:23.880 --> 16:25.746
different strokes
for different sects.

16:25.780 --> 16:27.441
- What's he have
to say about it?

16:27.480 --> 16:30.643
- Stolzfus, Hegeman.

16:31.790 --> 16:33.679
It's been a long time.

16:33.720 --> 16:35.313
- I remember you.

16:35.360 --> 16:36.850
- (Marcus): So...

16:36.890 --> 16:40.349
- Gentlemen, in the absence
of any set agenda,

16:40.400 --> 16:42.129
we've taken the liberty

16:42.160 --> 16:44.766
of providing some
entertainment this evening.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.029
Wolves.

16:46.970 --> 16:47.960
(Exhales)

16:48.000 --> 16:51.231
And then tomorrow--
- Will be tomorrow.

16:51.270 --> 16:52.669
- Of course.

16:55.110 --> 16:56.771
Well, shall we?

17:26.670 --> 17:28.330
Take off your clothes.

17:29.440 --> 17:30.646
- No.

17:30.680 --> 17:33.069
- Take off your clothes.

17:50.900 --> 17:52.197
(Sniffing)

18:00.680 --> 18:01.670
Bend over.

18:03.280 --> 18:04.509
- What?

18:04.550 --> 18:07.247
- Bend over.

18:21.230 --> 18:23.096
- I think we have a winner.

18:27.870 --> 18:31.408
- This all happened
very spur of the moment.

18:31.440 --> 18:33.772
And... who knows?

18:33.810 --> 18:35.335
Maybe he'll win.

18:37.880 --> 18:41.418
** T've got the blues *

18:41.450 --> 18:44.647
* I've got the blues *

18:44.690 --> 18:46.909
* I ain't got nothing
but the blues... *

18:46.950 --> 18:48.782
- We missed you
yesterday, Bishop.

18:48.820 --> 18:50.254
- Yes, my apologies.

18:50.290 --> 18:52.179
It was...

18:52.230 --> 18:54.255
personal matters.

18:55.630 --> 18:57.598
- Though, it's hard
to complain,

18:57.630 --> 18:59.769
given the time
this one showed us.

19:03.140 --> 19:05.507
- I apologize.

19:05.540 --> 19:06.769
There's a viewing
going on.

19:06.810 --> 19:08.107
- Who died?

19:08.140 --> 19:10.074
- A Jew.

19:10.110 --> 19:11.339
- Sad.

19:11.380 --> 19:13.246
- Now...

19:13.280 --> 19:16.841
we understand you have news
from Pennsylvania.

19:16.880 --> 19:18.143
- Yes.

19:18.190 --> 19:20.147
(Blood spurting)

19:20.190 --> 19:23.057
* I've got the blues *

19:23.090 --> 19:25.149
(Laughing)

19:27.800 --> 19:31.919
* I ain't got nothing
but the blues *

19:31.970 --> 19:35.565
* I ain't got nothing
but the blues **

19:35.600 --> 19:37.307
- What did he do?

19:37.340 --> 19:39.968
- He was your maker,
wasn't he?

19:40.010 --> 19:41.500
- Yes.

19:41.540 --> 19:45.272
- Yet you didn't rise up
to defend him...

19:46.750 --> 19:50.175
even after he let you
carry out your...

19:50.220 --> 19:52.314
heresy under his roof.

19:52.350 --> 19:55.058
Maybe because even you...

19:55.090 --> 19:57.559
with all your indiscretions...

19:58.860 --> 20:01.989
even you realized
that such sacrilege

20:02.030 --> 20:03.828
cannot go unpunished...

20:05.530 --> 20:08.932
cannot be allowed
to proliferate.

20:10.740 --> 20:12.435
You've fallen, Bishop.

20:13.810 --> 20:15.778
Let us help you up...

20:15.810 --> 20:17.574
brother to brother.

20:22.250 --> 20:24.218
- There's nothing
you can do for me.

20:26.590 --> 20:28.319
- I can give you Boston.

20:30.390 --> 20:33.849
It was always meant
to be yours...

20:33.900 --> 20:36.323
before all this.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.590
- I don't know what to say.

20:38.630 --> 20:40.735
- Give up the girl...

20:43.570 --> 20:45.664
Boston is yours.

20:46.410 --> 20:48.174
- No.

20:55.480 --> 20:57.141
- You knew one of them.

20:58.850 --> 21:00.557
The vampire, you knew him.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.484
- I...

21:04.530 --> 21:05.929
did.

21:07.130 --> 21:08.791
- Well...

21:08.830 --> 21:11.822
that must complicate
things for you.

21:14.300 --> 21:16.462
- I'm sure
there's a good reason.

21:16.500 --> 21:18.104
- For his inaction?

21:22.040 --> 21:24.475
The company he keeps...

21:24.510 --> 21:26.569
they're savage, heartless.

21:27.880 --> 21:29.848
But you know that.

21:32.590 --> 21:34.752
- We're strong.
We're strong now.

21:34.790 --> 21:37.213
We're strong now.
We can get out of this.

21:37.260 --> 21:39.388
We can jump the guards,
get outside.

21:39.430 --> 21:41.990
I mean, this is
a funeral parlour, right?

21:42.030 --> 21:43.566
It's not freaking Alcatraz!

21:43.600 --> 21:45.068
- Sure.

21:46.230 --> 21:47.891
We could do all of that.

21:47.940 --> 21:51.501
Maybe get outside
when the moon's at its fullest,

21:51.540 --> 21:53.975
run into a mother of three,

21:54.010 --> 21:56.433
who we proceed to rip apart.

21:56.480 --> 21:59.006
- That's why they don't
even lock you up.

22:00.050 --> 22:01.415
"Cause they've got
you brainwashed

22:01.450 --> 22:04.340
into thinking you're
as monstrous as they are!

22:06.990 --> 22:10.119
- They don't lock me up...

22:10.160 --> 22:13.596
because they know I would
no longer try to escape.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.065
Out there,
I could hurt someone.

22:19.230 --> 22:21.232
You'll see.

22:22.400 --> 22:24.402
You live out there
long enough,

22:24.440 --> 22:25.669
you turn someone.

22:25.710 --> 22:27.678
- Not if you're careful.

22:27.710 --> 22:30.077
- I always thought I was.

22:32.380 --> 22:35.042
It's safer here.

22:35.080 --> 22:37.048
Here it's contained.

22:45.490 --> 22:48.130
- What are you doing
with all those notes?

22:50.870 --> 22:52.463
- Probably nothing.

22:55.170 --> 22:57.662
(Sighs)

23:00.010 --> 23:02.274
- I have a notebook, too.

23:04.010 --> 23:06.149
I was going to med school...

23:07.580 --> 23:09.048
before.

23:09.080 --> 23:13.347
I thought I could start to
isolate the transformation,

23:13.390 --> 23:14.915
learn to stop it.

23:16.920 --> 23:18.627
(Inhales)

23:19.560 --> 23:20.789
- And?

23:30.070 --> 23:31.959
- Aidan, thank God!
Josh is--

23:32.010 --> 23:33.978
- I know.
- You know he's gone?

23:34.010 --> 23:36.775
How do you know that?
- Why aren't they here?

23:36.810 --> 23:39.472
- Where are you coming from?
I've been looking for you.

23:39.510 --> 23:41.069
I went to the hospital!

23:41.120 --> 23:45.011
Aidan, he just vanished!
You need to call the police!

23:45.050 --> 23:46.848
- No police!

23:46.890 --> 23:49.018
- What are you looking for?
- Keys.

23:50.830 --> 23:53.720
- Hey, I'm in this, too!
Keys to what?

23:53.760 --> 23:54.852
- Sapp & Sons.

23:54.900 --> 23:57.153
- That old funeral home? Why?

23:57.200 --> 23:59.089
- Josh is there.
- You know where he is?

23:59.130 --> 24:00.097
And you have keys?

24:00.130 --> 24:01.939
- I had them
a long time ago.

24:01.970 --> 24:03.802
I can't involve you in this.

24:03.840 --> 24:06.366
- Aidan, I haven't been
able to do anything!

24:06.410 --> 24:09.539
Someone somewhere down the line
has gotta let me try!

24:09.580 --> 24:12.049
- Ah, they're not here!

24:14.450 --> 24:15.576
- We need a plan!

24:15.620 --> 24:17.179
- I'll have one!

24:18.390 --> 24:21.109
- They let me
study them afterwards

24:21.160 --> 24:22.650
for physical traits,

24:22.690 --> 24:24.920
reactions, that sort of thing.

24:24.960 --> 24:26.450
(Whooshing)

24:26.490 --> 24:28.128
- (Sally): Josh!

24:28.160 --> 24:29.525
- Hey!

24:29.560 --> 24:32.598
- There are vampires here.
A lot!

24:32.630 --> 24:34.530
And they are not
respectful of ghosts.

24:34.570 --> 24:36.436
I just popped in upstairs,

24:36.470 --> 24:38.939
and they tried to dissipate me
with a fire iron.

24:38.970 --> 24:39.937
Not pleasant!

24:39.970 --> 24:42.007
We need to get you
out of here!

24:42.040 --> 24:44.702
- Sally, this is Douglas.

24:44.750 --> 24:46.206
- OK...

24:46.250 --> 24:47.240
Hi.

24:48.250 --> 24:50.241
I'm in the right place, right?

24:50.280 --> 24:52.510
Somewhere scary
that you do not wanna be?

24:52.550 --> 24:54.917
- Yes. Yeah, yeah.
But it's...

24:54.960 --> 24:56.450
It's useless.

24:56.490 --> 24:57.889
- Aidan has a plan.

24:57.930 --> 24:59.420
- Yeah...

24:59.460 --> 25:01.929
I saw Aidan and his buddies.

25:01.960 --> 25:03.894
I'm pretty sure
he doesn't have a plan.

25:03.930 --> 25:07.366
In fact, I'm certain
that we don't remotely know

25:07.400 --> 25:10.097
what dark insanity
he's wrapped up in.

25:10.140 --> 25:11.699
- No, he's trying to be good!

25:11.740 --> 25:14.038
- I wanna believe that, too.
I do. But...

25:14.080 --> 25:18.802
I just keep thinking, if he was gonna
do something, why hasn't he done it yet?

25:22.720 --> 25:24.415
And he's a werewolf, too.

25:26.090 --> 25:28.115
They're gonna make us
fight each other.

25:28.160 --> 25:29.286
- What?
- Yes!

25:29.320 --> 25:32.529
That's the level of shock
I was looking for.

25:32.560 --> 25:36.394
- OK, we need to psyche you up
so you do really, really well.

25:36.430 --> 25:38.626
Yeah, Josh, he's old.
You can take him!

25:38.670 --> 25:40.126
- Yeah, he's old.

25:40.170 --> 25:41.729
He's stronger.

25:41.770 --> 25:46.606
They've been keeping him down here for
15 years, Sally. This fight is all he does!

25:46.640 --> 25:49.280
And there's no "doing well."

25:49.310 --> 25:51.347
There's winning
or there's dying.

25:53.580 --> 25:55.571
I have to kill a man.

25:58.750 --> 26:02.550
That's not who I am.
I can't do that.

26:02.590 --> 26:04.786
- I think you have to.

26:07.360 --> 26:08.430
(Exhales)

26:29.620 --> 26:32.646
- I can't fix
what's happened between us,

26:32.690 --> 26:36.354
but for a second, please,
I need you to put that aside.

26:36.390 --> 26:39.257
You hate them
as much as I do.

26:39.290 --> 26:42.396
But Marcus, he likes you.
He could be swayed by you.

26:42.430 --> 26:45.161
- He wouldn't savagely
murder my progeny.

26:45.200 --> 26:46.167
Is that what you mean?

26:46.200 --> 26:47.861
- He has the keys
to this place,

26:47.900 --> 26:49.937
and I am sure that
he would give them to you.

26:49.970 --> 26:53.008
- Keys, Aidan?
That's your big plan?

26:53.040 --> 26:56.601
- I could unlock the cage. I could
figure out-- - You can't bend the bars?

26:56.640 --> 26:59.541
- I don't know! Maybe!
I'm not Superman.

26:59.580 --> 27:01.571
- And you don't drink live.

27:01.620 --> 27:05.181
Why don't you ask Bishop
extra super sweetly?

27:05.220 --> 27:08.588
- Because this whole thing is
being staged for the Dutch.

27:08.620 --> 27:10.019
Bishop would
never cross them.

27:10.060 --> 27:14.896
And I would be slaughtered even
before I got anywhere near Josh's door.

27:14.930 --> 27:19.925
- Well, then it looks like you're
running out of options, aren't you?

27:21.640 --> 27:24.302
- Josh is the only
family I've got.

27:30.610 --> 27:32.806
- It didn't have
to be that way.

27:34.120 --> 27:39.843
- This is not the way to take your revenge on me.
- Oh...

27:39.890 --> 27:41.358
(Whooshing)

27:41.390 --> 27:43.313
What is that?

27:44.330 --> 27:46.128
- Sally! No, you can't be here!

27:46.160 --> 27:48.822
- It's you,
from the video.

27:48.860 --> 27:52.023
- Oh, you shared!
Oh, that's nice.

27:52.070 --> 27:55.734
- I don't know what the deal is
between you two and I don't really care...

27:55.770 --> 28:00.139
No, I do care because you've
obviously scrambled his brains!

28:00.170 --> 28:01.808
Why aren't you
doing something?

28:01.840 --> 28:03.638
- Oh, sweetie...

28:03.680 --> 28:06.240
no one's gonna stop
the crazy train in this place.

28:06.280 --> 28:10.649
I suggest that you walk towards something
white and pretty and just stay out of it.

28:10.680 --> 28:12.387
- I'm not gonna let
this happen to Josh.

28:12.420 --> 28:14.058
- Good luck with that.

28:15.660 --> 28:20.222
If it makes you feel any better, I
understand how you feel. Really, I do.

28:22.230 --> 28:23.595
- Aidan...

28:23.630 --> 28:25.769
you choose these
monsters over us?

28:25.800 --> 28:27.768
- I am one of them!

28:27.800 --> 28:31.134
This goes back further
than you could know.

28:31.170 --> 28:34.777
And there is a way that I have to handle this!
- By not doing anything?

28:34.810 --> 28:37.507
Yeah, you had your centuries
of badness. I get that!

28:37.540 --> 28:40.077
But you committed to
a new kind of life with us,

28:40.110 --> 28:42.545
with Josh, at least,
who's actually living,

28:42.580 --> 28:43.979
who actually matters!

28:44.020 --> 28:46.512
- OK--
- Look...

28:46.550 --> 28:48.814
I obviously don't know you.

28:48.860 --> 28:50.112
So you tell me,

28:50.160 --> 28:52.128
have you ever
in your endless life

28:52.160 --> 28:55.221
cared enough about anything
to actually take a stand?

28:57.330 --> 29:00.789
* Pretty baby,
ooh wee... *

29:00.840 --> 29:03.059
- What is this, Aidan?

29:05.110 --> 29:07.807
It's a desk in
a funeral-home garage.

29:07.840 --> 29:09.501
It's life in the shadow.

29:09.540 --> 29:11.850
- No, no, no,
this is our reality.

29:11.880 --> 29:13.871
This is what
we have been working for.

29:13.920 --> 29:16.343
All you had to do
was say yes!

29:17.990 --> 29:19.810
- No, you don't understand.

29:19.850 --> 29:21.852
- I don't understand?

29:21.890 --> 29:23.756
(Laughing)

29:23.790 --> 29:25.428
I don't understand? OK.

29:25.460 --> 29:27.087
Uh...

29:27.130 --> 29:29.849
I had a family.
You took it from me.

29:29.900 --> 29:31.459
You took my life from me

29:31.500 --> 29:33.127
and then convinced me

29:33.170 --> 29:35.832
that we were gonna build
something else, something made...

29:35.870 --> 29:39.170
Something that would
celebrate our immortality!

29:39.210 --> 29:41.304
And you are squandering it!

29:41.340 --> 29:43.331
God, you are such a hypocrite!

29:43.380 --> 29:46.077
I used to honour you!
I used to fear you!

29:46.110 --> 29:49.648
And now I can barely recognize
what you are anymore!

29:50.950 --> 29:53.851
- I can't lose her, Aidan.

29:53.890 --> 29:56.882
I'm sorry.
I can't lose her.

29:56.920 --> 29:59.059
(Breathing heavily)

29:59.090 --> 30:01.400
(Crying)

30:02.730 --> 30:04.664
- Well, then you've lost me.

30:06.930 --> 30:10.161
I can't trust you with my life
the way that I once did.

30:12.640 --> 30:15.405
And if you don't
get rid of her...

30:15.440 --> 30:17.374
I can't support you.

30:17.410 --> 30:19.242
And they...

30:21.450 --> 30:23.612
They will kill you.

30:25.990 --> 30:27.480
And I'm not gonna
stay around

30:27.520 --> 30:29.716
to suffer your consequences
and tidy up your mess.

30:29.760 --> 30:31.228
Not anymore.
I'm done!

30:31.260 --> 30:32.557
- Aidan...

30:32.590 --> 30:34.024
- I'm not gonna heed you.

30:34.060 --> 30:36.256
I won't succumb to you,
not ever again.

30:36.300 --> 30:39.463
I renounce you
as my maker.

30:40.400 --> 30:42.437
- You would turn
your back on me?

30:43.640 --> 30:44.937
- Oh...

30:44.970 --> 30:47.268
Smarten up, pal.

30:47.310 --> 30:50.132
Because either
I leave you now...

30:51.880 --> 30:54.349
or I betray you later.

30:59.550 --> 31:01.689
Tell me that you understand.

31:17.640 --> 31:20.530
>K

31:49.340 --> 31:51.866
I need you to
let Josh go.

31:53.610 --> 31:56.705
- I'm afraid it's a bit
too late for that.

31:58.980 --> 32:01.142
- I'll come back.

32:02.820 --> 32:05.243
With the understanding
that if I do,

32:05.290 --> 32:08.260
Josh walks out of here
a free man.

32:09.420 --> 32:11.957
- Could you be a bit
more specific? Come back--

32:11.990 --> 32:13.389
- To you.

32:15.130 --> 32:17.428
I'll come back to you.

32:24.110 --> 32:27.307
(Crowd cheering)

32:34.950 --> 32:37.874
(Sirens in distance)

32:44.190 --> 32:47.353
- Not long now, pup.
Come here, boy.

32:47.390 --> 32:48.892
Come here!

32:51.230 --> 32:53.995
- (Sally): Don't let
the bastard scare you, Josh.

33:04.650 --> 33:05.708
(Exhales)

33:09.050 --> 33:10.472
- Get undressed.

33:22.130 --> 33:23.757
(Cheering)

33:28.740 --> 33:32.040
Yeah! Yeah!

33:32.070 --> 33:34.277
Come on! Come on!

33:35.680 --> 33:37.102
Whoo!

33:37.810 --> 33:39.346
Come on!

33:44.190 --> 33:45.919
- Bishop...

33:48.190 --> 33:49.988
(Josh screaming)

33:50.020 --> 33:52.455
(Breathing heavily)

33:55.660 --> 33:56.991
(Screaming)

33:57.030 --> 33:58.589
- Marcus!

34:00.470 --> 34:02.529
(Josh screaming)

34:08.380 --> 34:10.268
(Continues screaming)

34:16.650 --> 34:19.745
I'm afraid I have
some bad news, gentlemen.

34:19.790 --> 34:21.518
The older wolf is sick.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.085
It wouldn't be
a fair fight,

34:23.120 --> 34:28.149
at least not fair for all those
who have laid down money.

34:28.199 --> 34:29.520
(Grunting)

34:32.530 --> 34:35.465
- Ahh!

34:35.500 --> 34:37.867
- I know how much you appreciate
a good wolf fight

34:37.900 --> 34:39.299
and I don't wanna
disappoint you,

34:39.340 --> 34:41.172
so we'll just watch
this one transform,

34:41.210 --> 34:45.373
and that should salvage
the evening somewhat, no?

34:45.409 --> 34:48.380
- Or you could volunteer
some of yours to fight him.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.946
(Josh growling)

34:50.980 --> 34:52.914
- Well, Hegeman,
that would be suicide.

34:52.949 --> 34:57.217
And I'm afraid I can't afford
to lose any of my people.

34:58.630 --> 35:00.359
- But you have so many.

35:01.400 --> 35:02.526
So many.

35:04.730 --> 35:06.596
(Growling intensifies)

35:21.010 --> 35:22.409
(Growling)

35:40.830 --> 35:44.266
- I'm afraid there was
a bit of a problem.

35:46.010 --> 35:49.230
(Growling)

35:49.280 --> 35:52.409
- Stop it!
You told me you would stop it!

35:52.450 --> 35:54.214
- Go ahead.

35:54.250 --> 35:55.911
(Growling)

36:07.290 --> 36:09.452
Go for the neck!
Come on!

36:09.500 --> 36:12.390
Look at your little friend,
the cowardly lion.

36:16.200 --> 36:17.998
Come on!

36:30.280 --> 36:31.588
(Whimpering)

36:43.300 --> 36:46.122
- I don't know
how to live with myself.

36:48.670 --> 36:51.093
- It stays with you.

36:52.370 --> 36:53.838
The first time I...

36:55.010 --> 36:59.243
I couldn't even blink
without seeing that man's face.

36:59.280 --> 37:02.648
- Why didn't they
lock me up like Douglas?

37:04.080 --> 37:05.741
What did you do?

37:06.890 --> 37:10.155
- Something that was gonna
catch up with me anyway.

37:10.190 --> 37:12.056
- What the hell does that mean?

37:17.900 --> 37:20.892
- I have to go back to them.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.629
At least for
a little while.

37:25.710 --> 37:27.701
- You'd go back there?

37:30.280 --> 37:33.102
- Bishop, he did me a favour,

37:33.150 --> 37:36.142
and I have to do this for him.

37:36.180 --> 37:37.818
- Oh...

37:37.850 --> 37:40.740
- It's a code of honour
between us.

37:40.790 --> 37:45.819
- Where exactly
is the honour in that?

37:45.860 --> 37:48.124
With them?

37:49.200 --> 37:53.125
- You should know, Sally,
that what you said...

37:53.170 --> 37:54.467
it mattered.

37:55.040 --> 37:56.929
I was scared,

37:56.970 --> 37:58.665
selfish even.

38:00.710 --> 38:02.872
It's really you
who saved Josh.

38:04.450 --> 38:06.305
- And doomed you?

38:06.350 --> 38:08.614
Aidan, no.

38:08.650 --> 38:10.049
- Sally's right.

38:12.350 --> 38:15.684
What I saw in there...
How could you...

38:15.720 --> 38:17.210
do that?

38:17.260 --> 38:18.785
How could you
go back to that?

38:20.430 --> 38:23.195
When all this,
this house...

38:24.670 --> 38:27.264
It was all your idea
in the first place!

38:29.900 --> 38:31.061
I mean...

38:31.100 --> 38:32.966
God, Aidan...

38:33.010 --> 38:35.331
what are we supposed to
believe in

38:35.380 --> 38:37.178
if we can't believe in you?

38:37.210 --> 38:39.349
- You can.

38:41.420 --> 38:44.879
I just hope that
you both can forgive me.

38:50.060 --> 38:51.380
(Door closing)

38:51.430 --> 38:54.400
- Ah!
How did you get in here?

38:55.860 --> 38:58.522
- People have a hard time
saying no to me.

38:58.570 --> 39:00.425
- Mmm!

39:10.740 --> 39:12.174
Except for you.

39:12.210 --> 39:15.419
- James, I thought we agreed
not to talk about that anymore.

39:15.450 --> 39:17.441
- And we won't.

39:17.480 --> 39:19.141
We won't have to.

39:20.690 --> 39:22.749
- Are you all right?

39:24.690 --> 39:26.954
- Everything's OK, Jane.

39:26.990 --> 39:29.129
Everything is just grand.

39:29.160 --> 39:30.924
That's why I'm here.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.729
- Is it?

39:37.070 --> 39:39.960
- I love how vibrant you are,

39:40.010 --> 39:42.502
how alive...

39:45.010 --> 39:48.344
But lately,
I've been thinking...

39:50.320 --> 39:51.913
It's not natural.

39:54.860 --> 39:56.817
Don't you agree, Jane?

39:57.860 --> 39:59.624
- Yes, of course.

39:59.660 --> 40:02.391
It's not natural at all.

40:03.430 --> 40:04.966
- You see, because...

40:05.970 --> 40:08.166
if you're here...

40:08.200 --> 40:11.033
then I'm reminded
of my weakness.

40:11.070 --> 40:13.539
And you're a temptation to me.

40:13.570 --> 40:16.130
And I have to be
stronger than that,

40:16.180 --> 40:17.409
the way I used to be.

40:17.440 --> 40:20.569
Do you have any idea
who I used to be?

40:27.890 --> 40:30.154
(Choking)

40:31.890 --> 40:33.858
My love...

40:33.890 --> 40:37.690
That's right...
That's right...

40:37.730 --> 40:40.563
(Choking)

40:40.600 --> 40:44.161
We built something wonderful,
you and I, Jane,

40:44.200 --> 40:47.534
but I'm afraid this
is where it has to end.

40:51.240 --> 40:53.140
You said so yourself,

40:53.180 --> 40:55.239
And you were right.

40:55.280 --> 40:58.784
You were just being
true to yourself,

40:58.820 --> 41:00.788
It's the same for me.

41:00.820 --> 41:05.781
** And I felt
my love's presence *

41:05.830 --> 41:07.958
* Though she's *

41:07.990 --> 41:11.028
* Far away *

41:11.060 --> 41:14.997
* Just a teardrop *

41:15.040 --> 41:17.338
* From heaven *

41:17.370 --> 41:21.500
* On a sunny day *

41:21.540 --> 41:26.148
* A teardrop from heaven *

41:26.180 --> 41:31.016
* Has shown me the way *

41:31.050 --> 41:34.588
* Maybe I've sinned **

41:42.400 --> 41:45.165
(Sirens blaring)

41:48.100 --> 41:51.536
It goes down.
But I'll be right back.

41:54.240 --> 41:56.106
Glad you could make it!

41:56.140 --> 41:59.440
- Let's just get this over with.
They've lingered long enough.

41:59.480 --> 42:02.643
- Right. Would you like to be
the one to tell them to leave?

42:04.350 --> 42:05.784
(Scoffs)

42:05.820 --> 42:08.084
Then let's just
get through this.

42:08.120 --> 42:10.885
We'll embrace them like
the genial hosts we are,

42:10.920 --> 42:14.151
let them sniff around Boston's
battlegrounds and whatnot.

42:14.190 --> 42:15.897
They'll say what they have
to say, then they'll leave.

42:15.930 --> 42:17.455
- They don't even
like this city.

42:17.500 --> 42:18.820
They're only here
to judge us.

42:18.870 --> 42:20.019
- And we judge them

42:20.070 --> 42:23.267
and their provincial farm
life smelling of barn owls.

42:23.300 --> 42:24.859
To each his own, Aidan.

42:27.040 --> 42:29.907
It's worth another
50 years of peace.

42:29.940 --> 42:31.101
- Fine.

42:35.280 --> 42:37.214
- Gentlemen!

42:37.250 --> 42:39.389
Shall we get some dinner?

42:41.350 --> 42:43.352
(Girls laughing)

42:49.860 --> 42:52.659
- What are they doing here?

42:52.700 --> 42:55.533
- I think we both know
the answer to that.

42:55.570 --> 42:57.868
Tomorrow they're gonna kill me.

42:59.940 --> 43:02.409
It's good to
have you back, Aidan.

43:02.440 --> 43:06.445
<i>** I got the nicest smile,
the smoothest lines *</i>

43:06.480 --> 43:09.450
* So stay away from me *

43:09.480 --> 43:12.586
* 'Cause I'll break your heart
or you'll break mine *

43:12.620 --> 43:14.509
* And I don't wanna
lose again *

43:14.550 --> 43:16.279
* No, sir-ee *
