‐ Mr. Casablancas.
‐ [ Big Dick laughs ]

21:26.320 --> 21:29.242
KEITH: Clyde, hey!
What a bonus.

21:29.242 --> 21:31.413
‐ How are ya, young man?
KEITH: Pretty good.

21:31.413 --> 21:34.252
‐ What are you doin' here, come down
to see about some new retail space?

21:34.252 --> 21:36.048
‐ [ Big Dick guffaws ]
CLYDE: Go ahead, have a seat.

21:36.048 --> 21:37.467
‐ I'll only take a minute.

21:37.467 --> 21:40.223
But don't tell my client, because
it's gonna appear as an hour

21:40.223 --> 21:43.354
on the invoice.
‐ [ laughs ] Your secret's safe with us.

21:43.354 --> 21:45.984
‐ Yeah, it's just, uh...

21:45.984 --> 21:49.199
since that pizza guy made that accusation
at the City Council meeting,

21:49.199 --> 21:52.581
my client's been on me,
"Have ya checked out Casablancas?

21:52.581 --> 21:54.836
Is it true he's buying up
all those properties?"

21:54.836 --> 21:56.046
‐ It's a load of horse shit, Keith,

21:56.046 --> 21:57.716
you know that.
‐ I know, that's what I told 'em.

21:57.716 --> 22:01.014
I said, "Hey, he might run off with
your money, but the man's not a killer."

22:01.014 --> 22:04.939
BIG DICK: Hm.
KEITH: So here's what I came to ask.

22:04.939 --> 22:08.154
‐ Shoot.
‐ Central Moon Limited.

22:08.154 --> 22:09.991
Skyburst Resources Limited.

22:09.991 --> 22:12.370
Pentalink Commercial Limited.

22:12.370 --> 22:14.416
Those names mean anything to you?

22:14.416 --> 22:16.211
‐ Mm, nuh...

22:16.211 --> 22:19.635
‐ Those are all subsidiaries
of Team Casablancas Realty.

22:21.013 --> 22:23.309
‐ Oh, yeah. I thought
they sounded familiar.

22:23.309 --> 22:26.064
LLCs are like ex‐girlfriends.
There's too many to remember.

22:26.064 --> 22:27.693
CLYDE:
We had to face facts, Keith.

22:27.693 --> 22:30.198
We have an image problem
at Team Casablancas.

22:30.198 --> 22:33.622
Small business owners
don't wanna sell to this...

22:33.622 --> 22:36.586
tall, tan, handsome,
Maserati‐drivin' prick.

22:37.546 --> 22:40.761
‐ You know, Keith, one of those bombs
when off 50 yards from my son.

22:40.761 --> 22:42.598
You tell your clients that.

22:42.598 --> 22:44.727
‐ Yeah, right. That's right.

22:44.727 --> 22:47.482
The volleyball match.
Veronica was there.

22:47.482 --> 22:49.277
‐ Yep.
KEITH: I'll tell them that.

22:49.277 --> 22:51.908
[ sighs ] This job...

22:51.908 --> 22:54.956
sometimes I feel like
I'm prostituting myself.

22:58.505 --> 23:00.132
But that should get 'em off this tangent.

23:00.132 --> 23:01.594
Gentlemen, thanks for your time.

23:01.594 --> 23:03.389
‐ Hey, uh, Clyde here tells me
you've been seeing

23:03.389 --> 23:04.976
some of our favorite doctors.
Any news?

23:04.976 --> 23:07.438
‐ Another week or two,
I should hear.

23:07.438 --> 23:09.944
And truly, thank you for that.

23:09.944 --> 23:11.698
You need anything, I'm your guy.

23:12.950 --> 23:15.413
Oh, uh... did ya hear?

23:15.413 --> 23:18.586
Pizza guy is telling people
he found a duck in his bed.

23:18.586 --> 23:20.882
‐ [ laughs ]
‐ Seems the type.

23:20.882 --> 23:22.761
‐ Maybe he had it comin'.

23:26.435 --> 23:27.896
[ door opens, closes ]

23:27.896 --> 23:29.859
‐ You just connected us
to the shell companies.

23:29.859 --> 23:32.698
Maybe you don't understand the concept‐‐
‐ He knew, Dick.

23:32.698 --> 23:35.662
He <i>knew.</i> That's why he asked.

23:36.914 --> 23:39.461
He just wanted to see
if you were gonna lie about it.

23:53.280 --> 23:56.328
‐ What'd you do with him, Veronica?
Where is he?!

23:56.328 --> 24:00.504
‐ Are you asking, "Where in the world
is <i>cabron</i> Juan Diego?"

24:00.504 --> 24:01.964
‐ You're not funny.

24:01.964 --> 24:04.637
‐ Weren't you worried about him
going to prison and getting shot?

24:04.637 --> 24:06.682
He's safe now. You're welcome.

24:06.682 --> 24:08.895
‐ He's his family's main earner.

24:08.895 --> 24:11.233
His mom's been on my ass
about lost income

24:11.233 --> 24:12.653
ever since he disappeared.

24:12.653 --> 24:14.532
‐ She sounds like a lovely woman.

24:15.659 --> 24:17.370
‐ We can't all be like you.

24:17.370 --> 24:19.583
Practically perfect in every way.

24:19.583 --> 24:21.294
‐ Sure you can. It's easy.

24:21.294 --> 24:24.969
First, stop working on behalf
of the richest asshole in Neptune

24:24.969 --> 24:27.473
in a plot to drive you and your people
out of town.

24:28.726 --> 24:30.396
Sorry, does the truth hurt?

24:30.396 --> 24:33.026
You need a spoonful of sugar
to make that medicine go down?

24:33.778 --> 24:36.116
‐ I wake up every day...

24:36.116 --> 24:38.955
tryin' to figure out a way
to take care of my people.

24:39.790 --> 24:42.671
But you? You've got degrees

24:42.671 --> 24:45.217
from Stanford and Columbia

24:45.217 --> 24:47.180
that you don't even use.

24:47.180 --> 24:50.687
You'd rather stay in this town
that you <i>say</i> you hate,

24:50.687 --> 24:54.110
tasing teenagers
and makin' 'em wet their pants.

24:54.110 --> 24:57.492
‐ You had a wife and a daughter
and a legit business,

24:57.492 --> 24:59.496
and you pissed it all away.

24:59.496 --> 25:01.584
‐ I got shot, Veronica.

25:01.584 --> 25:05.132
Some rich white lady shot me

25:05.132 --> 25:07.638
and <i>I got arrested!</i>

25:07.638 --> 25:09.767
‐ Yeah, that was shitty.

25:09.767 --> 25:11.521
And I was there for you.

25:11.521 --> 25:13.983
And so was my dad and so was Cliff.

25:13.983 --> 25:15.946
But you were weak.

25:15.946 --> 25:18.408
Just go. Get outta here.
Go be a low‐level hood.

25:18.408 --> 25:20.747
But know this:
that is how I'm gonna treat you.

25:20.747 --> 25:25.005
And when you <i>are</i> run out of this town,
don't forget, I told you so.

25:26.299 --> 25:27.051
‐ Okay, Veronica.

25:27.051 --> 25:28.136
[ knocking ]

25:28.136 --> 25:29.765
‐ Is this a bad time, or...?

25:29.765 --> 25:32.186
‐ Go ahead. She's all yours.

25:34.023 --> 25:37.488
‐ [ clears throat ]
I'm s‐surprised you're here.

25:37.488 --> 25:39.242
I didn't see your car outside.

25:39.242 --> 25:41.998
‐ Uh, Logan's using it.
What‐‐ What do you‐‐

25:41.998 --> 25:44.210
‐ I was checking in,
seeing if you followed up

25:44.210 --> 25:45.839
on that thing that I told you?

25:45.839 --> 25:49.513
‐ My dad hit Big Dick and Clyde
with the "prostitute yourself" clue,

25:49.513 --> 25:51.182
and neither of them flinched.

25:51.892 --> 25:53.688
‐ Just means they were ready for it.

25:53.688 --> 25:56.067
‐ We're pretty certain
they were responsible for the duck,

25:56.067 --> 26:00.409
but it's possible said duck
is just retribution

26:00.409 --> 26:04.960
for standing up at a City Council meeting
and calling 'em murderers.

26:04.960 --> 26:06.129
‐ I suppose.

26:06.129 --> 26:07.591
But what can we do to help?

26:07.591 --> 26:10.054
I mean, we have a stake in this now.

26:10.054 --> 26:14.020
‐ A five percent stake.
‐ Well, that's a lot of pizza deliveries.

26:15.314 --> 26:17.778
‐ How are Murderheads
at deep background checks?

26:18.946 --> 26:21.368
‐ Deep background is where we excel.

26:21.368 --> 26:24.667
‐ Okay. You know
the Hearst fraternity Pi Sigma?

26:24.667 --> 26:27.839
‐ Yeah, but, ya know, Cho's Pizza
doesn't really deliver there anymore.

26:27.839 --> 26:29.551
Lot of issues over the years.

26:29.551 --> 26:32.516
‐ All right. One of 'em died
at a beach party three springs breaks ago.

26:32.516 --> 26:35.020
I visited the three buddies
who were with him that night,

26:35.020 --> 26:36.398
and they all clammed up.

26:36.398 --> 26:39.278
‐ Uh, what's the connection
to the spring break bomber?

26:39.905 --> 26:42.786
‐ I don't know. [ sighs ]
But they're guilty of something.

26:44.038 --> 26:46.418
Find out everything you can
about these three guys.

26:47.713 --> 26:49.257
‐ Consider it done.

26:54.225 --> 26:56.522
‐ [ low chatter ]

27:10.717 --> 27:12.637
‐ You're kidding, right?

27:12.637 --> 27:15.852
I break a shitload of government regs,
risk a court‐martial,

27:15.852 --> 27:18.148
for... milkshake money?

27:18.148 --> 27:19.818
‐ Re‐gifted milkshake money at that.

27:19.818 --> 27:21.864
‐ Hm.
‐ But I figured saving you

27:21.864 --> 27:24.786
from certain death in that firefight
in Mukalla was also worth something.

27:24.786 --> 27:26.206
‐ Hm.

27:28.961 --> 27:31.090
Name and address of your hacker.

27:31.090 --> 27:33.554
‐ Thanks for this, man.
Enjoy those shakes...

27:33.554 --> 27:35.390
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER: Hm.
‐ ...and being alive.

27:36.977 --> 27:39.106
‐ Dude's name popped up
on neo‐Nazi watch lists

27:39.106 --> 27:40.860
and with the sorts
of pro‐gun organizations

27:40.860 --> 27:43.824
that think the NRA
are a bunch of libtard pussies.

27:43.824 --> 27:47.541
So, if you're gonna pay him a visit...
be packin'.

28:16.389 --> 28:18.310
[ dogs barking ]

28:24.322 --> 28:26.702
‐ Logan Echolls.
I'm with the Office of Naval Intelligence.

28:26.702 --> 28:28.998
Are you Barton Netherfield?
‐ Yeah.

28:28.998 --> 28:31.169
‐ We traced a suspicious IP address

28:31.169 --> 28:32.881
to this‐‐
‐ Goddamnit!

28:32.881 --> 28:34.885
Junior!

28:34.885 --> 28:36.597
[ sighs ]

28:36.597 --> 28:38.809
‐ So... how'd you pull it off?

28:38.809 --> 28:40.563
‐ How'd I‐‐
‐ Congressman Maloof.

28:40.563 --> 28:43.736
You neutered that Muslim cuck.
You beat us to the punch.

28:43.736 --> 28:45.782
That's just what we needed,
a Manchurian Candidate

28:45.782 --> 28:47.661
taking his orders from the mullahs,

28:47.661 --> 28:50.248
infiltrating the highest levels
of our government. Am I right?

28:51.417 --> 28:52.504
‐ Yes, sir.

28:52.504 --> 28:55.342
‐ So then, tell me.
How'd you do it?

28:56.845 --> 28:59.266
‐ Y‐You're gonna laugh.
‐ Hm.

28:59.266 --> 29:02.941
‐ Three years ago my humanities class
took a trip to Suckramento

29:02.941 --> 29:05.112
when Maloof was a state senator.

29:05.112 --> 29:08.619
Dumb‐ass had a sticky note
on his computer with the password.

29:08.619 --> 29:11.457
You know what Maloof's into, right?

29:12.877 --> 29:15.090
He's a submissive.
‐ Hm.

29:15.090 --> 29:17.929
‐ Th‐These girls make him grovel
before they'll even, like,

29:17.929 --> 29:19.390
take off a glove.

29:19.390 --> 29:22.146
"Please, please, please!"

29:22.146 --> 29:25.528
H‐He doesn't get to touch himself
until some 20‐year‐old Ukrainian girl

29:25.528 --> 29:27.239
gives him permission.

29:27.239 --> 29:29.243
Pathetic, right?

29:29.243 --> 29:33.042
So, ever since I got recordings
of Maloof jerking it,

29:33.042 --> 29:34.880
I've owned him.

29:34.880 --> 29:38.721
‐ Yes, I'm gonna pass on that five,
but while we're on the topic of numbers,

29:38.721 --> 29:41.434
how do you feel about ten years in prison,
Junior?

29:41.434 --> 29:42.729
‐ What?

29:42.729 --> 29:44.983
‐ I need you to erase
every recording you have,

29:44.983 --> 29:46.987
every piece of code linked to Maloof.

29:46.987 --> 29:49.910
Then you're gonna send him an email
saying you found Jesus,

29:49.910 --> 29:52.498
you've seen the light
and changed your errant ways, hallelujah.

29:54.126 --> 29:56.088
And I swear...

29:56.088 --> 29:58.636
if you ever contact Maloof again
for any reason,

29:58.636 --> 30:00.848
if he gets so much as
a two‐star Yelp review,

30:00.848 --> 30:02.685
I will drag you down to Guantanamo.

30:04.564 --> 30:06.067
‐ You think Maloof's clean?

30:07.277 --> 30:10.618
Then why'd he transfer a ton of Bitcoin
into the accounts of these two?

30:14.041 --> 30:15.503
I did some digging.

30:15.503 --> 30:18.843
They're killers for a Mexican drug cartel.

30:29.614 --> 30:31.075
‐ You were gone when I got up.

30:31.075 --> 30:32.704
‐ I went for a run.

30:33.831 --> 30:35.585
‐ You wanna talk about
the other night?

30:37.087 --> 30:39.008
‐ [ sighs ] Nope.

30:39.801 --> 30:43.016
‐ Okay. So, I learned something today.

30:43.016 --> 30:45.353
‐ Finnish is derived from Russian?

30:45.353 --> 30:48.067
No. Dogs have 42 teeth.

30:48.067 --> 30:49.863
‐ Your client, my employer,

30:49.863 --> 30:54.204
paid two cartel hitmen
a little over $100,000 in Bitcoin.

30:54.204 --> 30:57.712
‐ What?!
‐ I visited Maloof's blackmailer.

30:57.712 --> 31:01.302
He's a 17‐year‐old white nationalist
living outside of Bakersfield.

31:01.302 --> 31:03.222
He just explained to me at great length

31:03.222 --> 31:06.020
that cryptocurrency is, in fact,
traceable.

31:06.020 --> 31:07.649
These are the guys.

31:09.986 --> 31:11.698
‐ I saw this guy.

31:13.159 --> 31:15.455
In the parking lot
of Weevil's body shop.

31:15.455 --> 31:17.627
‐ So what does it all mean?

31:17.627 --> 31:19.296
‐ No idea.

31:20.591 --> 31:25.225
Oh. Vinnie said something
about Maloof hiring him

31:25.225 --> 31:27.522
to find a couple of Mexican guys.

31:27.522 --> 31:30.528
But why hitmen?
And why the money?

31:32.364 --> 31:34.451
Ya done good, kid.

31:34.451 --> 31:36.540
You might have a future in this racket.
LOGAN: Hm.

31:36.540 --> 31:39.420
‐ I definitely owe you one.
‐ I'd like to cash in now.

31:41.424 --> 31:42.969
How 'bout...

31:42.969 --> 31:44.889
you and me...

31:44.889 --> 31:47.562
‐ I'm liking it so far.

31:47.562 --> 31:51.027
LOGAN: Picture this. The two of us...
VERONICA: Mm‐hm.

31:51.027 --> 31:52.864
‐ ...gettin' busy...

31:52.864 --> 31:55.536
getting in touch with our feelings?

31:55.536 --> 31:57.623
‐ You're talking about couples therapy.

31:57.623 --> 31:59.418
[ sighs ] Sorry.

31:59.418 --> 32:02.090
I mean, "Hangin' with Jane."

32:04.721 --> 32:09.480
‐ Hey.
May I join you in the cool kids room?

32:10.482 --> 32:13.071
‐ I gotta get to work.
VERONICA: Okay.

32:14.281 --> 32:16.368
LOGAN: See ya, Keith.
‐ Yeah.

32:21.505 --> 32:23.634
Something wrong?

32:23.634 --> 32:25.554
‐ Nothin' a strip club can't fix.

32:25.554 --> 32:26.807
‐ Excuse me?

32:27.767 --> 32:32.192
‐ What? You're always saying
we don't do enough father‐daughter stuff.

32:32.192 --> 32:34.196
DANIEL: I'm standing at the urinal,

32:34.196 --> 32:37.160
and the guy three stalls down screams!

32:37.160 --> 32:39.373
I rush over to help...

32:39.373 --> 32:41.168
and it's goddamn Paul Ryan.

32:41.168 --> 32:43.507
[ laughing ] He was in a hurry
to get back for a vote...

32:43.507 --> 32:44.843
‐ Probably to kill health care.

32:44.843 --> 32:46.011
