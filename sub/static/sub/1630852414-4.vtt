WEBVTT

00:14.139 --> 00:17.434
Can you please tell me
what you're trying to do?

00:17.517 --> 00:19.978
Marcela wanted to bail on your app.
I saved you.

00:20.061 --> 00:21.938
Ana, I didn't ask you to save me.

00:22.022 --> 00:25.650
Especially not if you want
to turn the app into an online store

00:25.734 --> 00:27.444
that profits from maternity

00:27.527 --> 00:30.113
and with no social responsibility.

00:30.196 --> 00:32.323
Marcela showed me your pitch deck.

00:33.241 --> 00:35.702
This app is about creating a safe space

00:35.785 --> 00:37.996
for new mothers. That's what it's about.

00:38.079 --> 00:40.915
Mariana, we're entrepreneurs,
not psychologists.

00:41.458 --> 00:45.045
We need to turn a profit.
We need to be self-sufficient.

00:45.670 --> 00:49.215
Okay, but I have a right to ask
that you respect my ideas

00:49.299 --> 00:51.092
and not take over what's mine.

00:51.176 --> 00:53.094
Are you accusing me of stealing your app?

00:53.178 --> 00:54.596
No, just warning you

00:54.679 --> 00:57.265
that you're not going to control me
or Regina, okay?

01:01.936 --> 01:04.606
A NETFLIX SERIES

02:01.996 --> 02:05.792
Even if Ana is an investor,
we're the developers.

02:05.875 --> 02:07.752
So we're entitled to be heard, right?

02:08.920 --> 02:10.505
That's what I need to talk to you about.

02:11.172 --> 02:13.967
-I have to quit the app.
-Why?

02:14.050 --> 02:17.720
Because I want to spend more time
on a video game I'm developing.

02:21.850 --> 02:25.728
Looks like we're still in sync.
We both got texts at the same time.

02:29.482 --> 02:30.483
Let's see.

02:30.567 --> 02:32.819
It's an invitation to Ceci's prom.

02:32.902 --> 02:34.487
You owe me a chocolate!

02:34.571 --> 02:35.864
Man, come on.

02:37.115 --> 02:40.660
Since we're so in sync,
why don't we go together?

02:43.705 --> 02:45.456
My invitation has a plus-one.

02:48.084 --> 02:49.252
So does mine.

02:51.337 --> 02:52.922
Are you going to invite anyone?

02:54.883 --> 02:57.594
I'm sure I can find
an interesting prospect.

02:58.887 --> 02:59.846
Really?

03:00.471 --> 03:01.306
That's great.

03:03.099 --> 03:05.643
Okay. Well, I should get going.

03:07.145 --> 03:09.314
Goodbye, sweetheart.

03:15.528 --> 03:16.905
-Bye.
-I'll close the door.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.200
What the hell was that, dude?

03:20.783 --> 03:21.784
What do you mean?

03:21.868 --> 03:25.038
Nothing, other than the fact
that your ex just told you

03:25.121 --> 03:28.333
she has several prospects
to bring to the party. You have zero.

03:29.167 --> 03:31.336
-Stay out of this.
-Fuck, man!

03:31.419 --> 03:34.088
You can't show up alone!
That's what losers do.

03:34.672 --> 03:36.049
Isn't that right, princess?

03:36.132 --> 03:38.551
Your dad is a dumbass, isn't he?

03:38.635 --> 03:40.261
<i>I didn't do anything wrong!</i>

03:40.845 --> 03:43.181
It was just a party. A small get-together.

03:43.932 --> 03:45.058
You're overreacting.

03:45.141 --> 03:48.186
Overreacting? You said
you were no longer seeing the grandma.

03:48.269 --> 03:49.979
What? Are you crazy?

03:50.063 --> 03:51.940
I saw her. She was at your party.

03:52.023 --> 03:53.233
What? How?

03:53.316 --> 03:54.525
Don't play dumb.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.946
Maybe you shouldn't go to Ceci's prom.

03:58.029 --> 03:59.697
I'm not sharing a table with you.

04:00.949 --> 04:04.244
Sorry to interrupt,
but you're both banned from my prom.

04:04.327 --> 04:07.080
Stop fighting,
or I'll give the tickets back.

04:07.163 --> 04:09.749
I won't let you ruin
the most important day of my life.

04:10.458 --> 04:12.460
Oh, by the way, Dad,

04:12.543 --> 04:14.212
Mom is definitely crazy,

04:14.295 --> 04:16.422
but I also saw Tere
outside your apartment.

04:21.010 --> 04:22.053
Happy now?

04:27.976 --> 04:29.602
Mr. Juan Carlos,

04:29.686 --> 04:33.564
everything Valentina needs
is in the diaper bag.

04:38.444 --> 04:39.779
Hi, Valentina.

04:40.738 --> 04:41.739
Shall we go home?

04:42.448 --> 04:44.075
<i>Don't change the subject, Pablo.</i>

04:44.158 --> 04:45.785
Take Cynthia as your date.

04:45.868 --> 04:46.744
Cynthia?

04:47.245 --> 04:51.082
It's either that or look like a loser
when Mariana walks in

04:51.165 --> 04:56.170
with one of those hipster dudes
she's working with.

04:56.254 --> 04:59.215
Listen, man, Cynthia is perfect for you.

04:59.716 --> 05:00.550
Think about it.

05:02.260 --> 05:05.680
-This will be the perfect party.
-Perfect!

05:06.597 --> 05:09.225
I got the most amazing dress.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.935
Mine too. It's on hold.

05:11.019 --> 05:12.228
Really? Mine too!

05:12.312 --> 05:14.439
I'll show you mine, and you show me yours.

05:14.522 --> 05:15.690
All right.

05:15.773 --> 05:16.649
Let's see.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.487
No way. It's the same dress.

05:21.571 --> 05:25.199
-I chose mine first.
-No, I found it first!

05:25.283 --> 05:28.536
Dude, the dress is form-fitting.
It'll look way better on me.

05:28.619 --> 05:30.788
-What?
-Seriously, Ceci.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.915
Buy another dress.
Don't embarrass yourself.

05:34.208 --> 05:36.044
The dress is mine, period.

05:44.093 --> 05:45.011
Hello?

05:45.511 --> 05:47.430
<i>I have several missed calls from you.</i>

05:47.513 --> 05:49.599
Tell me. What can I do for you?

05:49.682 --> 05:52.060
<i>This is going to sound crazy.</i>

05:52.143 --> 05:54.062
-Ana told me that--
<i>-It's true.</i>

05:55.063 --> 05:59.025
I was outside your apartment, yes.
Unfortunately, Ana and Ceci saw me there.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.069
Why were you here?

06:01.152 --> 06:03.404
-Are you stalking me?
<i>-Of course not.</i>

06:03.488 --> 06:06.991
Why don't you ask your brother Víctor
what we were doing there?

06:07.575 --> 06:08.701
Víctor?

06:08.785 --> 06:10.536
<i>Yes, Víctor.</i>

06:10.620 --> 06:12.955
You know what? Don't call me again.

06:15.958 --> 06:18.461
That was very good.

06:19.128 --> 06:21.130
Your mask is going to crack.

06:24.509 --> 06:26.386
Valentina, which side is the front?

06:27.345 --> 06:30.807
Altagracia, any chance
you packed a diaper-changing manual?

06:30.890 --> 06:35.520
Just place the girl on top of the diaper.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.356
Then fold it up and fasten the tabs.

06:38.439 --> 06:40.483
Pay attention to the front side.

06:40.566 --> 06:42.735
That's the problem.
I can't tell which side is the front.

06:43.319 --> 06:44.987
Well, me neither, sir.

06:45.071 --> 06:47.448
<i>That's why Mrs. Ana hired a nanny.</i>

06:47.532 --> 06:49.784
Thanks for nothing, Altagracia. Goodbye.

06:54.997 --> 06:58.209
Hell yeah!

06:59.252 --> 07:00.086
What's up?

07:00.169 --> 07:02.588
Hey, do you have time to do me a favor?

07:02.672 --> 07:04.549
Sure. Is this a math problem?

07:05.133 --> 07:07.427
It's a little more complex than that.

07:07.510 --> 07:08.761
<i>I'm so worried.</i>

07:08.845 --> 07:10.388
Come on, Mariana.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.099
Can we talk about something
other than Ana?

07:13.182 --> 07:14.392
No, we can't.

07:14.475 --> 07:17.979
Now she wants to sell
heels, sexy lingerie,

07:18.062 --> 07:20.064
and expensive makeup through my app.

07:20.148 --> 07:22.608
This stuff has nothing to do
with maternity!

07:22.692 --> 07:24.235
Everything is negotiable.

07:24.318 --> 07:25.987
Well, not this.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.990
You know what else she said?

07:29.073 --> 07:32.326
She's preparing a pitch
for an important client.

07:32.410 --> 07:33.953
She's so annoying.

07:34.036 --> 07:37.415
Some say there's a thin line
between love and hate.

07:38.082 --> 07:39.834
And you look furious.

07:40.543 --> 07:42.128
Maybe you're not over her.

07:42.211 --> 07:46.007
Stop projecting
your lesbian fantasies onto me.

07:46.090 --> 07:47.925
The point is, I'm not rolling over.

07:48.009 --> 07:49.093
Yeah, I get that.

07:49.677 --> 07:52.805
You know what else I get?
I'm a partner in the app, right?

07:52.889 --> 07:54.474
I own a tiny share,

07:55.099 --> 07:57.185
which means I can go to the office

07:57.268 --> 07:59.020
and help you control Miss Perfect.

08:04.442 --> 08:05.651
-Hi, Ana.
<i>-Cynthia.</i>

08:05.735 --> 08:10.323
The graphics you sent me
for Patricia's pitch are perfect.

08:10.406 --> 08:13.117
Thanks, Ana. I'm glad you liked them.

08:13.201 --> 08:14.952
Come work with me.

08:15.036 --> 08:15.870
<i>Thanks.</i>

08:15.953 --> 08:17.830
I promise I'll think about it.

08:17.914 --> 08:20.208
I hope Pablo
isn't the reason you're staying.

08:20.291 --> 08:22.043
There's no future with Manolo.

08:22.126 --> 08:23.794
-Good point.
<i>-Think about it.</i>

08:23.878 --> 08:27.006
I'd like you to be there
when I pitch to Patricia.

08:27.089 --> 08:28.299
I can't rely on Mariana.

08:28.382 --> 08:33.179
Actually, yesterday she sent me
some social responsibility slides

08:33.262 --> 08:34.889
<i>to include in the presentation.</i>

08:34.972 --> 08:35.973
Delete them.

08:36.057 --> 08:37.892
We don't want to spook the client.

08:37.975 --> 08:40.353
Yeah, okay. Will do.

08:41.229 --> 08:42.396
<i>Don't be scared.</i>

08:42.480 --> 08:45.566
The most important thing
is to make Valentina feel safe.

08:45.650 --> 08:48.986
-Act like you know what you're doing.
-But I'm clueless.

08:49.070 --> 08:52.448
No wonder Ceci banned me
from her prom. I'm a terrible dad.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.367
-She didn't invite you?
-Yeah.

08:54.867 --> 08:57.036
But only if I make peace with her mom.

08:58.246 --> 09:00.039
You can go as my plus-one.

09:02.458 --> 09:05.127
Ana and I have a lot to learn
from you and Mariana.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.837
You're doing things right.

09:08.589 --> 09:10.466
Look, I did it!

09:12.176 --> 09:15.721
Now that Valentina's changed,
how about we play <i>Mortal Kombat?</i>

09:15.805 --> 09:17.348
-Definitely.
-Nice.

09:17.431 --> 09:19.517
-Want a beer?
-Yes, please.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.060
<i>We're going to have so much fun.</i>

09:21.143 --> 09:23.729
Where and when are we meeting
for the dress fitting, Ceci?

09:24.355 --> 09:28.150
Oh, it's at Toxic Boutique, at 11:00.

09:28.234 --> 09:29.443
Doesn't "toxic" mean--

09:29.944 --> 09:32.446
Oh no. My presentation is at 11:00.

09:32.530 --> 09:34.657
Well, never mind. I'll figure it out.

09:34.740 --> 09:37.660
Yours will be the prettiest dress.
I'll make sure of that.

09:37.743 --> 09:43.249
Look, I was thinking
maybe some sequins, sheer details,

09:43.332 --> 09:44.792
or something kind of--

09:44.875 --> 09:48.087
Mom, it's a graduation party,
not Grandma's birthday.

09:49.171 --> 09:50.006
Well--

09:50.590 --> 09:52.383
Sweetie, the organizer has to stand out.

09:52.466 --> 09:54.885
Just look at this.

09:56.804 --> 09:59.181
It was a great idea to invite Mijares.

09:59.265 --> 10:00.725
You'll see.

10:00.808 --> 10:04.312
When you play one of their songs,
the dance floor will be packed.

10:04.395 --> 10:07.273
Mom, first you and Dad have to make up.

10:07.356 --> 10:08.482
I'm not hungry.

10:15.698 --> 10:18.034
KONENE
A SAFE SPACE

10:20.119 --> 10:23.205
I LOOK SO CHUBBY!

10:23.289 --> 10:26.375
<i>-Ceci, are you okay?</i>
-I need help with my prom dress.

10:26.459 --> 10:29.378
Okay, but what was that
about looking chubby?

10:29.962 --> 10:31.672
Can you come to my dress fitting?

10:31.756 --> 10:33.716
Is Ana okay with that?

10:33.799 --> 10:35.217
She obviously doesn't know.

10:35.843 --> 10:38.429
I don't want her there.
She'll only criticize me.

10:38.512 --> 10:40.473
Okay, count me in.

10:42.767 --> 10:45.144
Why was Tere at my door
that night at the party?

10:45.227 --> 10:46.562
Hang on. Don't yell at me.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.273
The noise from the remodel
is more than enough.

10:53.861 --> 10:54.862
Rorros.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.198
Face masks.

10:57.281 --> 10:59.659
What does that have to do with Tere?

10:59.742 --> 11:01.327
Was she with you? Yes or no?

11:01.994 --> 11:03.412
Yes, I was there with her.

11:03.496 --> 11:06.374
You said you'd help me
end that relationship.

11:06.457 --> 11:09.460
I did, but then we started
a business together.

11:10.294 --> 11:11.253
A face mask business?

11:11.921 --> 11:13.673
Among other stuff.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.841
We're opening a beauty salon.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.093
A beauty salon?

11:17.176 --> 11:19.428
For men. We even rented out a space.

11:19.512 --> 11:22.014
Fuck, Víctor.
Call Tere and tell her it's off.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.642
Juan Carlos, I'm not doing that.

11:25.393 --> 11:26.477
Why not?

11:26.560 --> 11:29.063
In here, you're the boss,

11:29.146 --> 11:30.564
the favorite son.

11:31.524 --> 11:34.652
You'll inherit the family business
while I follow orders.

11:34.735 --> 11:36.153
That's fine with me.

11:36.237 --> 11:39.031
But out there, I can do what I please.

11:39.115 --> 11:41.450
So I'm not dissolving
the business with Tere.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.120
-No way, Víctor!
-Yes way.

11:44.203 --> 11:48.958
You know what? I'm fucking sick of you
shooting down all my ideas.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.002
You're a ballbuster, Juan Carlos.
A ballbuster.

11:52.086 --> 11:56.006
Ana saw Tere outside my place
and thinks I'm still seeing her.

11:56.590 --> 11:58.217
All because of your stupid salon.

11:58.300 --> 12:00.344
I'll clear it up at the prom.

12:00.428 --> 12:01.262
No.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.098
You're not invited to the prom.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.517
You'll probably show up with Tere.

12:24.201 --> 12:25.035
Sorry.

12:25.745 --> 12:26.954
Are you leaving early?

12:28.414 --> 12:30.124
I have a doctor's appointment.

12:30.916 --> 12:31.834
Oh.

12:32.835 --> 12:35.212
Actually, I'm helping Ana
with her presentation,

12:35.296 --> 12:36.964
but please don't tell Manolo.

12:37.047 --> 12:38.174
Of course not.

12:39.925 --> 12:41.844
Everything okay? Need anything?

12:43.179 --> 12:44.221
You busy Saturday?

12:44.930 --> 12:46.474
I don't have plans. Why?

12:48.517 --> 12:51.145
No, no reason. We'll talk later.

12:54.315 --> 12:55.149
Okay.

12:56.609 --> 12:57.485
Bye.

13:09.830 --> 13:10.790
This one.

13:11.457 --> 13:12.458
Good?

13:12.541 --> 13:13.501
Thank you.

13:17.755 --> 13:18.714
Excuse me.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.258
Hi, do you work here?

13:22.468 --> 13:26.430
Do you sell prom dresses
at your other locations?

13:27.556 --> 13:28.432
No.

13:34.563 --> 13:36.732
<i>Your call has been forwarded</i>
<i>to voice mail.</i>

13:36.816 --> 13:38.776
<i>Leave your message after the tone.</i>

13:38.859 --> 13:40.820
Cecilia, where the hell are you?

13:41.529 --> 13:44.114
You told me to meet you
at a store for weird people.

13:44.198 --> 13:45.115
Call me back.

13:48.786 --> 13:51.664
I swear I didn't mean you. I swear it.

13:52.164 --> 13:54.041
In fact, I love your outfit.

13:54.834 --> 13:55.668
Bye.

13:55.751 --> 13:57.586
<i>Ceci wasn't there.</i>

13:57.670 --> 13:59.547
-What are you going to do?
<i>-</i>Her prom is Saturday.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.215
I can't let her choose by herself.

14:01.298 --> 14:02.675
-This Saturday?
-Yes.

14:04.218 --> 14:05.135
Elena!

14:05.928 --> 14:07.304
What are you doing here?

14:07.388 --> 14:09.598
Mariana invited me
since I'm a partner too.

14:13.561 --> 14:14.436
Come on.

14:15.104 --> 14:17.189
Your products will be seen

14:17.273 --> 14:19.650
by thousands of users
in our virtual store.

14:19.733 --> 14:23.153
That's right. The app is an online store,

14:23.237 --> 14:25.573
but more importantly, it's a community.

14:26.657 --> 14:28.325
-You may continue, Ana.
-Sure.

14:29.243 --> 14:32.538
Your brand will explode in every sense

14:32.621 --> 14:35.416
through branding, SEO, and leads.

14:35.499 --> 14:38.544
Not to mention sales on our platform.

14:38.627 --> 14:40.880
But for us to carry your products,

14:40.963 --> 14:43.424
your company must be socially responsible.

14:43.507 --> 14:44.884
Excuse me?

14:45.384 --> 14:48.262
Mariana, I'm trying to pitch
a business strategy.

14:48.345 --> 14:50.931
Sure, we want the app to be a business,

14:52.308 --> 14:55.519
but it's very important for us
that the content be sponsored

14:55.603 --> 14:58.731
by products from companies
that give back to society.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.902
Why wasn't that
included in the pitch, Cynthia?

15:02.985 --> 15:07.197
I'm sorry, but I'm getting a sense
that you're not in agreement.

15:07.281 --> 15:09.033
-Who should I listen to?
-Me.

15:11.660 --> 15:14.288
I'm the commercial director
of this project.

15:14.371 --> 15:18.167
Right, and I'm the developer
who's protecting its essence.

15:18.250 --> 15:22.004
Yeah, but don't get it wrong, Mariana.
This is a business meeting.

15:24.131 --> 15:26.884
Ana, I came here today
because I respect your work.

15:26.967 --> 15:28.677
Get on the same page.

15:28.761 --> 15:32.890
Next time, if there is one,
don't waste my time.

15:45.819 --> 15:46.695
Ana!

15:49.490 --> 15:50.491
Ana!

15:52.242 --> 15:54.495
Did you expect me to keep my mouth shut?

15:54.578 --> 15:58.415
That woman is an entrepreneur
who used to respect me.

15:58.499 --> 16:01.752
But her company and products
clash with my app's philosophy.

16:01.835 --> 16:05.547
Your app was no longer yours
when you sold Marcela more than half.

16:06.256 --> 16:08.759
So get your head out of your ass, kid.

16:08.842 --> 16:12.513
If you want to give Regina a future,
you must change your mindset.

16:12.596 --> 16:16.850
You have no right to butt into my life,
Miss Control Freak!

16:16.934 --> 16:18.852
Miss Confused Hippie.

16:26.735 --> 16:27.820
Ana!

16:30.739 --> 16:32.366
You're just like your mom.

16:32.449 --> 16:33.409
You ruin things.

16:33.492 --> 16:34.910
What's she got to do with it?

16:34.994 --> 16:37.746
You know your mom
and Juan Carlos are still a thing.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.206
You're making things up.

16:39.289 --> 16:41.125
Sorry, can I turn off the PA system?

16:41.208 --> 16:42.334
Which PA system?

16:43.961 --> 16:46.797
This one.
You're broadcasting to the whole office.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.386
Stupid millennial office!

16:57.349 --> 16:59.935
<i>Mom, what is this about you</i>
<i>still seeing Juan Carlos?</i>

17:01.937 --> 17:04.023
No, Mariana, it's not what you think.

17:04.106 --> 17:06.108
How many times have I heard that?

17:06.191 --> 17:09.862
Listen to her, sweetie. Listen to her.

17:09.945 --> 17:12.990
Ana just told me
you're still seeing Juan Carlos.

17:13.073 --> 17:14.408
Yeah, but not really.

17:14.491 --> 17:15.993
<i>I was there with Víctor.</i>

17:16.076 --> 17:18.412
I waited for him downstairs.
I never went in.

17:18.495 --> 17:20.456
What were you doing with Víctor?

17:20.539 --> 17:23.125
Well, we're starting a business.

17:23.208 --> 17:26.170
<i>I'm telling you</i>
<i>so there is no misunderstanding.</i>

17:26.253 --> 17:29.298
Sweetie, listen to your mom
and support her.

17:29.381 --> 17:32.134
<i>She's doing things right this time around.</i>

17:32.217 --> 17:34.636
She's also taking a risk with this idea.

17:34.720 --> 17:35.554
Okay.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.890
<i>They're finally asleep.</i>

17:37.973 --> 17:40.184
I was so tired from work.

17:40.267 --> 17:42.186
I almost fell asleep with them.

17:42.811 --> 17:44.021
Don't you hate work?

17:44.104 --> 17:45.481
I don't hate it.

17:46.982 --> 17:49.651
I guess now it turns out
I'm working with the enemy.

17:50.444 --> 17:53.363
My brother made me look
like a liar with Ana.

17:54.615 --> 17:56.909
I don't know what to do
to earn her trust back.

17:56.992 --> 17:59.119
-You want Ana back, huh?
-Yeah.

18:00.162 --> 18:02.289
Of course. I can't cope without her.

18:02.873 --> 18:04.833
Tell her that. Fight for her.

18:05.584 --> 18:06.752
Fight for her?

18:06.835 --> 18:08.504
With everything you've got.

18:15.886 --> 18:17.721
<i>Mariana is so stubborn.</i>

18:17.805 --> 18:20.808
She made me look terrible
in front of a client.

18:20.891 --> 18:23.936
I told you. There's only one way
for that app to work.

18:24.603 --> 18:25.813
Buy her out

18:26.605 --> 18:27.481
and then

18:28.107 --> 18:29.775
cut her out of the company.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.360
I guess.

18:42.955 --> 18:45.457
-Ana!
-What are you doing here?

18:46.208 --> 18:47.417
You were right.

18:48.001 --> 18:50.462
Tere was at my door.
She was there with Víctor.

18:50.546 --> 18:51.755
Nice try.

18:51.839 --> 18:54.216
-I know Víctor always covers for you.
-Hang on.

18:55.467 --> 18:58.428
That's true, yes,
but so is my love for you.

18:59.054 --> 19:01.306
Besides, you have to believe me.

19:01.390 --> 19:02.724
Really? Why should I?

19:03.392 --> 19:04.893
First, 'cause I'm telling the truth.

19:05.644 --> 19:10.315
Secondly, because we need to make peace
if we want to attend Ceci's prom.

19:11.483 --> 19:12.818
You're being betrayed.

19:14.611 --> 19:17.531
She tried to offer you money
for your biological child.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.908
Now she wants your idea.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.452
She's planning
to buy you out from the app.

19:22.536 --> 19:23.912
Mariana, I heard everything.

19:24.413 --> 19:25.789
She wants to cut you off.

19:25.873 --> 19:28.834
They can't do that to me. It's my idea.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.879
-What am I supposed to do?
-I don't know.

19:32.546 --> 19:33.964
I'd sell it if I were you.

19:34.047 --> 19:36.008
It's too much drama.

19:37.384 --> 19:38.260
<i>You lied to me.</i>

19:38.844 --> 19:40.304
You sent me to a different store.

19:40.387 --> 19:43.765
Because you don't care about my life.
You only care about the dress.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.184
<i>Hi, how are you all?</i>

19:45.267 --> 19:47.978
<i>I wanted to tell you I have my prom dress…</i>

19:48.061 --> 19:50.355
-That's not true.
-<i>I don't want to brag, but it's amazing…</i>

19:50.439 --> 19:52.983
You're mad at what's going on
between your dad and me.

19:54.443 --> 19:57.070
But I want to be with you
when you choose your dress.

19:58.488 --> 19:59.656
Mom, stop it.

19:59.740 --> 20:03.368
Seriously, don't worry.
Someone else is coming with me.

20:03.452 --> 20:07.164
Well, even if Olivia is there,
you could use the opinion of--

20:07.247 --> 20:08.415
Olivia?

20:10.792 --> 20:13.587
Seriously? You don't even know
that Olivia and I are fighting.

20:13.670 --> 20:15.005
I'm going with Mariana.

20:16.006 --> 20:18.926
<i>She's a venomous snake.</i>

20:19.593 --> 20:20.552
-You call her.
-No.

20:20.636 --> 20:23.096
I don't like that Alma Toca woman.

20:23.180 --> 20:27.142
If I call her,
she'll know Ceci didn't want me there.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.852
I'll never hear the end of it.

20:29.603 --> 20:30.979
-Come on.
-Fine.

20:32.147 --> 20:33.398
Romelia!

20:34.066 --> 20:37.319
How are you, darling?
What a nice surprise!

20:37.402 --> 20:40.781
I'm just calling to find out
where and when

20:40.864 --> 20:43.408
the girls' dress fitting will be.

20:43.492 --> 20:45.911
Ana didn't tell you?

20:46.411 --> 20:47.746
Are you two fighting?

20:47.829 --> 20:48.914
<i>No, not at all.</i>

20:49.539 --> 20:52.876
I misplaced the info Ana gave me,

20:52.960 --> 20:56.546
and I don't want her
to think I don't care.

20:56.630 --> 20:59.466
In that case, I'll text you
the time and location.

20:59.549 --> 21:00.634
<i>You're the best.</i>

21:00.717 --> 21:01.551
Yes!

21:02.094 --> 21:03.679
See how easy that was?

21:11.895 --> 21:14.523
Are you at home or at the office?

21:19.319 --> 21:21.154
I finished my work early.

21:21.238 --> 21:23.907
Do you know how unprofessional it is

21:23.991 --> 21:26.535
to play games on the clock?

21:26.618 --> 21:31.915
Sorry, you can't say he's unprofessional
if he's quick and efficient.

21:39.006 --> 21:40.465
Video games are not allowed.

21:44.136 --> 21:45.178
Cynthia!

21:47.597 --> 21:49.474
These are from our latest collection.

21:51.351 --> 21:52.811
This is mine! It's mine!

21:56.690 --> 21:57.649
How about this one?

21:58.817 --> 22:00.110
It's extra-extra small.

22:00.193 --> 22:02.904
Don't be discouraged.
There are tons of dresses here.

22:02.988 --> 22:05.657
I'm sure you'll find one
that's perfect for you.

22:06.241 --> 22:07.075
I promise.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.431
Ceci.

22:29.514 --> 22:31.558
I think I found the perfect dress.

22:34.353 --> 22:35.437
<i>Thanks for that.</i>

22:35.520 --> 22:38.106
You shouldn't have risked it.
Manolo is a bastard.

22:38.190 --> 22:41.360
I couldn't just watch him abuse
someone I care about.

22:41.860 --> 22:42.778
Pablo,

22:44.112 --> 22:45.655
truth is, I have feelings for you.

22:46.448 --> 22:49.368
If you were going to invite me
to the prom, my answer is yes.

22:49.951 --> 22:51.286
I didn't get a plus-one.

22:51.787 --> 22:54.456
You asked if I had plans and--

22:54.539 --> 22:56.375
I was just curious.

23:03.256 --> 23:04.257
I'm an idiot.

23:06.760 --> 23:07.594
Cynthia!

23:07.677 --> 23:08.553
<i>Thanks.</i>

23:09.137 --> 23:11.973
-It's amazing.
-It looks wonderful on you.

23:13.141 --> 23:15.185
Do I look chubby?

23:15.268 --> 23:18.980
Of course not.
Forget about all that. You look beautiful.

23:19.064 --> 23:21.191
Remember, each body is unique.

23:21.274 --> 23:23.568
We should wear what we like.

23:25.570 --> 23:26.905
It's incredible.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.783
Thanks for helping me find it, Mariana.

23:29.866 --> 23:31.118
Take off that dress.

23:32.327 --> 23:34.287
It's too simple. You're the organizer.

23:34.371 --> 23:35.455
What are you doing here?

23:35.539 --> 23:38.500
I'm here to help you find
the perfect dress, and that one isn't it.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.504
-Ceci!
-Ana, I wouldn't go in there.

23:43.004 --> 23:46.508
You already ruined my presentation.
Don't ruin this moment with my daughter.

23:46.591 --> 23:48.552
But Ceci is feeling very insecure.

23:49.302 --> 23:51.471
Can you step aside so I can help?

23:53.807 --> 23:55.016
<i>Are you okay?</i>

23:55.100 --> 23:55.976
Of course not.

23:56.476 --> 23:58.979
Olivia said I wouldn't look good
in a tight dress.

23:59.062 --> 24:02.899
My mom doesn't think I can choose
a decent dress for my prom.

24:02.983 --> 24:04.067
I get it.

24:05.068 --> 24:07.571
I went through the same
when I got pregnant.

24:08.488 --> 24:11.700
Everyone was so judgmental.
It really killed my confidence.

24:12.742 --> 24:14.578
So, what did you do?

24:15.579 --> 24:19.958
I created an app
where those who felt the same way

24:20.041 --> 24:23.378
could express themselves freely,
without being judged.

24:24.463 --> 24:25.422
A safe space.

24:26.756 --> 24:29.968
But how can I have
a safe space like yours?

24:30.051 --> 24:34.181
You can start by telling your mom
how you really feel.

24:34.264 --> 24:37.601
No. Mariana, my mom doesn't listen.

24:37.684 --> 24:41.229
Talking to her is like talking to a wall.

24:42.063 --> 24:44.566
I honestly think that if you try

24:44.649 --> 24:47.527
and tell her what you need,
she'll listen to you.

24:48.987 --> 24:50.280
Come on. Go.

24:57.787 --> 24:58.830
Mom.

24:59.331 --> 25:03.502
I'm feeling insecure because I feel
like I can't trust you or Dad.

25:04.044 --> 25:05.962
I'm scared our family will fall apart.

25:08.215 --> 25:10.759
I'm scared our relationship
will be fractured

25:10.842 --> 25:13.011
with what's going on
between your dad and me.

25:13.595 --> 25:14.930
That's why I'm here.

25:15.013 --> 25:18.642
I want to be there for you
on such a big day in your life.

25:20.644 --> 25:21.686
I want you to know

25:22.562 --> 25:24.022
that no matter what happens,

25:25.190 --> 25:28.860
your dad and I love you,
and we'll always be a family.

25:36.785 --> 25:39.788
That dress fits you perfectly.
You look gorgeous.

25:40.497 --> 25:45.001
I said I didn't like it 'cause I'm jealous
it wasn't me who found it for you.

25:45.085 --> 25:46.002
Mom.

25:51.341 --> 25:53.051
Estela, sweetheart!

25:53.134 --> 25:56.137
You look divine in that dress.

25:56.221 --> 25:57.097
Out of this world!

25:57.931 --> 25:58.932
Do you like it?

26:00.600 --> 26:02.519
-Shall we try another store?
-Okay.

26:02.602 --> 26:03.728
-I'll wait here.
-Yeah.

26:03.812 --> 26:06.940
<i>I want to see Mariana's face</i>
<i>when she sees you with Cynthia.</i>

26:07.857 --> 26:08.692
I didn't invite her.

26:09.192 --> 26:10.235
Why?

26:10.777 --> 26:13.154
Because Cynthia told me
she has feelings for me.

26:14.197 --> 26:16.658
I don't think it would be fair
to lead her on.

26:17.659 --> 26:18.535
Right.

26:19.119 --> 26:21.746
You're certain
you have no feelings for her?

26:23.957 --> 26:25.041
Listen, bro.

26:26.501 --> 26:27.377
Don't you think

26:28.086 --> 26:31.506
you might be scared
that this could be something real?

26:32.215 --> 26:34.342
It's really simple. Now's not a good time.

26:35.176 --> 26:38.138
Things are stable
with Mariana and Regis. I won't risk that.

26:45.979 --> 26:47.105
Ana.

26:47.188 --> 26:49.733
I called to let you know
I quit my old job.

26:50.358 --> 26:52.193
I'm ready to come work for you.

27:10.754 --> 27:12.922
CLASS OF 2021

27:13.006 --> 27:14.466
Hey, don't push it.

27:15.342 --> 27:17.552
-Thanks. I'll see you in a bit.
-Yeah.

27:22.891 --> 27:25.935
I'm glad you got the dress.

27:26.478 --> 27:28.104
Honestly, it looks great on you.

27:28.897 --> 27:30.190
You also look amazing.

27:30.273 --> 27:32.067
I got hung up on the dress

27:33.193 --> 27:35.862
because I felt I didn't look good
in anything else.

27:36.446 --> 27:39.407
We shouldn't be unhappy about our bodies.

27:39.491 --> 27:41.826
I really miss my best friend.

27:49.959 --> 27:52.170
-Hey, you.
-You look stunning.

27:52.879 --> 27:53.755
Thanks.

27:55.632 --> 27:56.508
Shall we?

28:00.428 --> 28:01.429
-Hi there.
-Hello.

28:02.347 --> 28:04.224
-Are you here alone?
-Yeah.

28:05.475 --> 28:06.601
Okay.

28:06.685 --> 28:08.853
<i>This is a time in our life</i>

28:08.937 --> 28:11.314
that we sometimes find hard to understand.

28:11.898 --> 28:17.946
This is where we question
who we are and who we'll become.

28:19.072 --> 28:20.782
But we also learn

28:21.408 --> 28:22.951
that the people we love most

28:23.535 --> 28:26.121
are actually fragile,
and they also make mistakes.

28:27.914 --> 28:31.084
Recently, I learned that we're responsible

28:31.167 --> 28:33.294
for creating our own safe space.

28:33.378 --> 28:36.089
We have to protect
and strengthen ourselves.

28:36.756 --> 28:40.009
The people we love most
will always be there for us.

28:41.010 --> 28:42.429
But one day,

28:42.512 --> 28:45.473
we may have to be there for them.

28:46.349 --> 28:48.518
So cheers to the graduates.

28:48.601 --> 28:50.562
Cheers!

28:54.733 --> 28:55.859
Ana,

28:55.942 --> 28:57.277
you look gorgeous.

28:57.902 --> 29:00.655
You look exactly
like you did at your college prom.

29:02.115 --> 29:03.742
Please, Juan Carlos.

29:03.825 --> 29:04.993
I'm serious.

29:05.076 --> 29:07.412
-Don't exaggerate.
-You haven't aged a bit.

29:07.495 --> 29:08.663
Oh, hi.

29:08.747 --> 29:11.332
-I wasn't expecting to see you together.
-We're together.

29:12.417 --> 29:13.877
We're very much together.

29:16.087 --> 29:18.548
That's great! Enjoy your evening.

29:19.424 --> 29:20.508
Congrats.

29:21.092 --> 29:23.970
I'm going to the ladies' room.
You're suffocating me.

29:40.695 --> 29:42.155
I owe you an apology.

29:42.864 --> 29:44.115
You were right.

29:46.242 --> 29:47.285
I was mistaken.

29:48.244 --> 29:50.163
Not just about Ceci, but the app too.

29:54.501 --> 29:57.837
I understand the importance
of creating a safe space for women,

29:58.421 --> 29:59.714
like the one we once had.

30:04.135 --> 30:05.804
Why did you invest in my app?

30:08.431 --> 30:10.016
I thought I might die…

30:11.935 --> 30:13.853
and I realized life is short.

30:15.021 --> 30:17.482
So, I decided

30:18.858 --> 30:20.777
not to do anything I don't believe in.

30:23.238 --> 30:25.156
I believe in your app
because I believe in you.

30:27.867 --> 30:29.869
I'm sorry for trying to change it.

30:33.706 --> 30:37.502
I'm sorry for trying to buy Regina.
It was a crazy thing to do.

30:39.712 --> 30:41.381
Not as crazy as me thinking

30:42.590 --> 30:46.094
I was in love with you
and telling you during the baptism.

30:48.346 --> 30:49.347
I get it now.

30:50.348 --> 30:53.643
I admire you
and care about you very deeply.

30:54.811 --> 30:55.812
As a friend.

31:00.817 --> 31:02.694
And congratulations on Ceci.

31:03.987 --> 31:07.407
I hope I can do such an amazing job
when Regina grows up.

31:08.908 --> 31:09.826
I missed you.

31:11.953 --> 31:13.788
Being close to you feels right,

31:14.289 --> 31:16.207
especially now that I'm going through

31:17.417 --> 31:19.794
a difficult moment in my marriage.

31:22.046 --> 31:25.925
My mom told me
you saw her at Juan Carlos's place,

31:26.467 --> 31:28.469
but she was there with Víctor.

31:28.553 --> 31:29.971
Juan Carlos didn't know.

31:31.639 --> 31:32.891
Ana?

31:32.974 --> 31:35.018
Where are you, girlfriend?

31:35.101 --> 31:36.311
-Guess what?
-What?

31:36.394 --> 31:38.897
They're about to play our song!

31:38.980 --> 31:39.856
Come.

31:45.987 --> 31:47.780
Mom bribed the DJ.

31:49.157 --> 31:51.451
I don't know what happened
between Ana and me,

31:51.534 --> 31:53.703
but I'll follow your advice to the end.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.706
Even if it hurts, like the song says.

32:00.251 --> 32:04.589
<i>Losing the battle</i>

32:05.173 --> 32:07.508
<i>I'm a soldier of love</i>

32:07.592 --> 32:09.636
<i>In this war between us…</i>

32:09.719 --> 32:12.305
It'd be great
if you and I could remain friends.

32:13.806 --> 32:14.849
Definitely.

32:16.643 --> 32:21.230
Hey, since we're friends and all,
there's something I want to say.

32:22.523 --> 32:23.816
I'm not an América fan.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.693
-No.
-Hey, come on.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.614
Wait, Pablo!

32:30.406 --> 32:31.532
I'm a Pumas fan!

32:33.576 --> 32:36.287
I was scared you'd bring someone.

32:38.331 --> 32:40.708
Same here.
I don't know what I would have done.

32:41.292 --> 32:43.795
But I'm not saying
I don't want you to date.

32:43.878 --> 32:45.421
I feel the same way.

32:45.505 --> 32:47.882
I don't want you to be single forever.

32:47.966 --> 32:49.092
Let's make a pact.

32:49.884 --> 32:51.970
If we start dating someone…

32:52.553 --> 32:53.638
…we tell the other.

32:53.721 --> 32:56.099
And introduce them to Regina only…

32:56.182 --> 32:57.642
…if it's getting serious.

32:57.725 --> 33:00.269
And it shouldn't affect…

33:00.353 --> 33:02.313
-…the stability we have now.
-Exactly.

33:08.069 --> 33:10.071
We did a good job with Ceci.

33:10.154 --> 33:11.114
Really good.

33:14.200 --> 33:15.201
Shall we dance?

33:20.123 --> 33:22.834
Mariana told me her mom
really was there with Víctor.

33:24.585 --> 33:25.545
I'm sorry.

33:26.129 --> 33:29.298
I know I still have work to do
to earn back your trust.

33:30.883 --> 33:35.471
Remember what we did at your college prom?

33:36.889 --> 33:39.434
Don't take advantage
of the fact I'm a bit tipsy.

33:39.517 --> 33:42.061
What's wrong with that? We're celebrating.
