01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
Gemini, this is Houston.
Can you hear us?

01:08.120 --> 01:13.160
Roger, Houston.
This is Captain Fred Randall.

01:13.280 --> 01:16.480
Houston, the earth looks beautiful.

01:16.600 --> 01:19.640
As a big blueberry.

01:20.640 --> 01:22.440
Got it, Houston.

01:22.560 --> 01:26.560
Oh my God! Why can not he
play football, like other kids?

01:26.680 --> 01:28.240
George.

01:53.800 --> 01:56.000
Houston, requesting permission to land.

01:56.120 --> 02:01.200
- Pilgrim One permission for landing.
- Copy that.

02:01.320 --> 02:03.880
Pilgrim One, cleared to land.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.800
Roger, Houston.

02:05.920 --> 02:09.960
Aero-Shell enabled.
Acceleration velocity normal.

02:13.120 --> 02:16.120
The heart rate is steady.
The man is ice cold.

02:21.920 --> 02:23.920
- Bill?
- I see it.

02:24.040 --> 02:26.720
Calls for 20% X gimbal correction.

02:26.840 --> 02:27.800
Say no.

02:27.920 --> 02:31.360
Negative.
Stay the course steady.

02:31.480 --> 02:33.560
- What is happening?
- This is not right.

02:33.680 --> 02:36.480
The computer says we will enter
too steep. 20.000 meters.

02:36.600 --> 02:41.160
Pilgrim falls rapidly to the surface of Mars.
Glide path deteriorates.

02:41.280 --> 02:44.080
- APU clear.
- Gary?

02:44.200 --> 02:46.920
Increase of 20%.
Do it now, or burn up.

02:47.040 --> 02:49.120
Switch to manual.

02:49.240 --> 02:52.200
Why corrects his course?

02:52.320 --> 02:54.240
- Can someone answer me?
- I do not know.

02:54.360 --> 02:57.320
Turns on the landing rockets.
Houston, we are off course.

02:59.400 --> 03:01.000
We're losing her.

03:01.120 --> 03:03.520
We lose the lander!
We're losing her!

03:12.200 --> 03:13.960
Why?

03:17.440 --> 03:20.360
Congratulations, you're all dead!

03:20.480 --> 03:24.200
Third time lucky now, Hackman!
Nice job with course correction!

03:24.320 --> 03:26.120
Paul, it was not his fault.

03:26.240 --> 03:29.480
Your computer is telling me that the right course.
It caused problems.

03:29.600 --> 03:32.160
Is this the problem? Excuse me!

03:32.280 --> 03:37.440
If Gary says that the computer mess up,
the mess up. Fix it!

03:42.120 --> 03:45.160
Give me the name of the guy
who wrote the software!

04:07.240 --> 04:10.080
The safest way to activate the burglar alarm.

04:13.040 --> 04:15.080
Good morning, everyone!
Hello, Claude!

04:15.200 --> 04:17.279
Hi, Kimmy Lee Wong!

04:28.480 --> 04:31.360
Five minutes into the
real work day begins.

04:31.480 --> 04:34.200
It is five minutes
to save the world.

04:42.120 --> 04:47.400
Die! Go back to your own planet!
Your large, orb-eyed fat thing!

04:54.240 --> 04:56.960
Your supervisor showed us.

04:57.080 --> 05:01.640
He said you were the man who created
our operational systems.

05:01.760 --> 05:05.880
Holy baby carrots!
You are the team in March!

05:06.000 --> 05:07.320
Mr. Randall ...

05:07.440 --> 05:10.560
Paul Wick, air traffic controller!

05:10.680 --> 05:13.840
Sir, I am a big fan of you!
It is ...

05:16.040 --> 05:19.880
William Overbeck.
Wild Bill Overbeck!

05:20.040 --> 05:21.920
Get in my office!

05:22.040 --> 05:27.680
I feel like a paleontologist who
eventually have to meet a dinosaur!

05:27.800 --> 05:30.960
- Thanks.
- Eight-shuttle mission! Eight!

05:31.080 --> 05:33.200
Nine actually, but who's counting?

05:33.320 --> 05:36.200
Apparently you my friend.

05:36.320 --> 05:38.360
Oh, thank you for taking him here!

05:38.480 --> 05:40.760
Bill, look at this.

05:43.360 --> 05:47.840
Gary Hackman? PC Specialist!
How does my baby you?

05:47.960 --> 05:53.120
That is why we are here. Some of us
think it could be a glitch.

05:53.240 --> 05:56.600
A glitch?
Oh, no it is not possible.

05:56.720 --> 06:00.080
I did the programming myself.
It's perfect.

06:00.200 --> 06:05.200
Not exactly. The counting error in
our entered track.

06:05.320 --> 06:07.280
Here is the data.

06:13.320 --> 06:16.640
Okay, when we set time.
Here it comes.

06:19.840 --> 06:24.200
- Does it, where it is.
- What? What is what?

06:24.320 --> 06:28.320
This popcorn shell has been fixed
between my teeth for two weeks!

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
That's your problem.

06:34.120 --> 06:38.520
Gary runs his Hohnan equations
which includes the effect of encumbrances

06:38.640 --> 06:41.160
as an inverse cube of the distance.

06:41.280 --> 06:44.480
I am a decorated astronaut.
I do not do that kind of mistake.

06:44.600 --> 06:47.600
Ok, wait. I'll show you.

06:47.720 --> 06:52.800
I insert the same calculations,
using what we call''the way''

06:52.920 --> 06:58.760
then we open the country's file and
initiates March landing sequence.

07:06.160 --> 07:08.560
"I've seen enough.
-Check this, guys.

07:13.160 --> 07:15.800
This is ridiculous! Move, Move!

07:17.120 --> 07:21.680
There is nothing wrong with my
figures. They are perfect.

07:26.320 --> 07:28.960
Wait just your geek.

07:38.280 --> 07:41.360
See? I told you,
it is the computer.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.040
I can explain everything.

08:03.160 --> 08:07.320
Fractured skull! Injured in
he tried if he was wrong!

08:07.440 --> 08:10.240
- I can explain it.
- He heard you.

08:10.360 --> 08:12.960
So ... what do we do now?

08:13.080 --> 08:14.520
We shoot at it.

08:14.640 --> 08:19.200
We can not Ben! You have seen
monitoring the satellite's report!

08:19.320 --> 08:22.840
There are periodic dust storms
that can last for months,

08:22.960 --> 08:24.840
which prevents the landing!

08:24.960 --> 08:29.120
If we wait now and one of
These storms begin!

08:29.240 --> 08:31.760
If we can not lift it again in two years!

08:31.880 --> 08:33.400
Then we wait two years!

08:33.520 --> 08:35.720
Ben, Ben, Ben ...

08:35.840 --> 08:39.120
If we terminate the start, will
all lose confidence in us.

08:39.240 --> 08:42.880
On you. On me.
For the entire NASA team.

08:43.000 --> 08:48.040
But ... we can sneak in a back-up.
In fact we have two choices.

08:48.160 --> 08:51.760
The first choice, of course,
Gordon Peacock.

08:51.880 --> 08:57.040
But ... he did not
test run for spaceflight.

08:57.160 --> 09:00.440
Try him again.
Who is your second choice?

09:05.720 --> 09:07.520
NASA.

09:11.440 --> 09:13.680
- Mr. Wick, can I call you Paul?
- No.

09:13.800 --> 09:14.960
- Are we there now?
- No.

09:15.080 --> 09:16.640
- How far away is it?
- Quiet.

09:16.760 --> 09:19.280
- Can I drive?
- No!

09:19.400 --> 09:21.600
Hey, where is the short guy John Glenn?

09:21.720 --> 09:25.800
Fred, I have less than a month
glad to see that you can become an astronaut.

09:25.920 --> 09:30.880
I have to give you an ID badge.
Stop here.

09:34.440 --> 09:36.320
Id badge.

09:36.440 --> 09:38.400
Write in down here.

09:51.160 --> 09:54.680
Hey, are you sure
we are on the way to Earth?

09:54.800 --> 09:57.760
For it looks just like the sun.

09:57.880 --> 10:02.360
Of course I'm sure your a fool!
How dare you question my authority?

10:05.320 --> 10:07.080
Good morning.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.280
Sorry. Sorry. It was not me!

10:11.400 --> 10:15.000
It was not me.
The waitress came to me, Mr. ...

10:16.280 --> 10:19.360
- Bud Nesbitt?
- Who the hell are you?

10:19.480 --> 10:23.320
Apollo 13!
You are the one who was responsible for ...

10:24.440 --> 10:29.040
When I say responsible, I
mean I was responsible for this.

10:29.160 --> 10:30.760
Apollo 13 was an accident.

10:30.880 --> 10:37.120
Sure! Just as the captain of
Exxon Valdez did not see Alaska.

10:37.240 --> 10:39.880
Can I have your autograph?

10:44.240 --> 10:46.800
What, one annan''olycka'', Bud?

10:46.920 --> 10:49.640
No, no, it was my fault.

10:49.760 --> 10:54.040
We just went here, and the waitress
just ran out ...

10:54.160 --> 10:58.800
and pushed me straight on
Bud Nesbitt, Apollo 13 desolator.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.160
Bud has been a little tense
recently ...

11:04.800 --> 11:07.280
... Ten or fifteen years.

11:33.880 --> 11:39.040
- Who are you?
- I'm Fred Rand ... Fred Rand ...

11:39.160 --> 11:41.960
- Is it Fred Randall.
- Fred Randall.

11:42.080 --> 11:44.400
Fred, meet your new roommate.

11:45.560 --> 11:50.160
Julie Ford, mission specialist, geologist.

11:50.280 --> 11:52.560
It's a real honor to be with you.

11:55.480 --> 11:59.000
In separate beds.

11:59.520 --> 12:03.480
Fred, she is not your roommate.
He is.

12:13.080 --> 12:16.640
I get it!
Lura beginner good burn!

12:16.760 --> 12:20.240
Legendary Living with
monkey joke!

12:20.360 --> 12:23.040
Ulysses is a chimpanzee, not monkeys.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.640
He is ...

12:24.760 --> 12:28.800
The key to finding life
on Mars.

12:33.800 --> 12:39.080
I train him to find a
special stone from underground fissures.

12:39.200 --> 12:43.120
Of course. There are
still damp under the surface.

12:43.240 --> 12:45.360
Where there's water,
can there be life.

12:45.480 --> 12:47.080
Good boy.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.080
Or dead.

12:49.200 --> 12:53.680
Death to all who dare
disrupt the dangerous Martian,

12:53.800 --> 12:58.120
underground devils with their
toxic feet and wet lips!

13:00.560 --> 13:04.120
Paul? Paul, can I talk
with you for a second?

13:04.240 --> 13:06.000
Sure.

13:09.360 --> 13:12.960
Looks like it's you and
I have my little Ewok.

13:13.080 --> 13:15.000
My first roommate!

13:15.920 --> 13:17.160
So what do you think?

13:17.280 --> 13:21.000
What do I think?
What is your idea here?

13:21.120 --> 13:23.080
Little Dr. Zaius.

13:30.880 --> 13:33.960
We go to Mars, so we
need a guy from Mars?

13:40.280 --> 13:43.280
He is a computer genius.
He is said to be odd.

13:43.400 --> 13:45.560
A little?

13:46.760 --> 13:48.640
Let me go!

13:48.760 --> 13:53.560
I will not let a number of
personal oddities ruin my career!

13:55.800 --> 14:00.560
Excuse me for my convenience
gets in the way of your career!

14:00.680 --> 14:04.560
This assignment means equal
much to you as me, Ford!

14:04.680 --> 14:10.920
And if Gordon can not handle it,
when is this guy our last hope.

14:12.840 --> 14:16.920
Ok, that's impressive.
They are friends already.

14:20.880 --> 14:25.520
Mom, please, stop comparing
this by running away!

14:25.640 --> 14:27.360
It's only temporary.

14:27.480 --> 14:30.360
Travel to Mars is not temporary,
Freddy.

14:30.480 --> 14:33.840
The last time you ran away
from home, only to the garage.

14:33.960 --> 14:37.000
Oh, I know, you're just
defiant right?

14:37.120 --> 14:41.360
Mom, I do not know if the
go to Mars for sure.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.560
I just wish I was.

14:44.600 --> 14:49.400
I have made peanut butter and jam
sandwiches. There is a long journey.

14:49.520 --> 14:52.200
Mom, I'm not hungry.

14:52.320 --> 14:55.920
Look, there's the moon, a star,
and a small rocket.

14:56.040 --> 14:59.400
I'm thirty!
I'm almost a grown man!

15:02.640 --> 15:04.600
I take this rocket.

15:12.800 --> 15:15.280
Is this not a gift!

15:15.400 --> 15:21.080
Finally, my own place.
No one tells me what to do.

15:32.040 --> 15:33.840
It was not me!

15:38.760 --> 15:43.360
Do not eat the puzzle in the house!
And certainly not jumping on the bed!

15:43.480 --> 15:45.200
Okay, I'm going out.

15:45.320 --> 15:49.600
If you put fire on the premises;
so is number 112. Thanks.

15:53.920 --> 15:55.760
Randall, come on,
I'll treat you to a drink.

15:55.880 --> 15:58.400
Wait a second.
I do not drink alcohol.

15:58.520 --> 16:02.400
Gil, a round of Blast-Off
for my friend Randall here.

16:02.960 --> 16:04.680
Blast Off? What is it?

16:04.800 --> 16:08.400
A special drink.
Just for us astronauts.

16:08.520 --> 16:12.200
- Oh, like a Tang?
- Exactly.

16:12.320 --> 16:15.080
Houston, we have ignition!

16:26.720 --> 16:28.920
- Excellent!
- Start the countdown.

16:29.040 --> 16:32.960
Three ... two ... one ... start!

16:33.080 --> 16:34.440
Start!

16:34.560 --> 16:35.680
Start!

16:35.800 --> 16:37.600
Start!

16:54.440 --> 16:56.960
Hi, Ford. Began work early?

16:57.080 --> 17:00.880
- Is this necessary?
- Absolutely, enjoy the show.

17:01.520 --> 17:04.560
To have someone so full of
this is wrong.

17:04.680 --> 17:09.920
Is he you want in a romper
beside you for 35 million mil home?

17:11.720 --> 17:13.760
Julie Ford!

17:15.079 --> 17:18.119
Julie Ford! Come on, let's dance!

17:21.400 --> 17:23.400
We dance!

17:26.440 --> 17:28.319
It was not me ...

17:28.440 --> 17:30.400
Guys have fun now, huh?

17:30.520 --> 17:32.600
Everyone laughs at us!

17:33.880 --> 17:36.560
This is not a school party!
This is NASA!

17:36.680 --> 17:40.000
Some of us have served
right to be here.

17:40.120 --> 17:42.840
If we can not replace Gary,
mission is stopped.

17:42.960 --> 17:46.520
So grow up but do not waste my time.

17:47.920 --> 17:49.600
Hi, Julie.

17:49.720 --> 17:53.640
I just tried,
you know ... fit.

18:12.720 --> 18:14.160
Julie?

18:18.360 --> 18:20.320
Oh, it's you.

18:25.960 --> 18:30.480
Do not worry little buddy.
It's just thunder.

18:30.600 --> 18:32.320
Frightens me.

18:32.440 --> 18:35.240
Can not sleep, huh?

18:35.920 --> 18:41.400
Ok. I sing a
little lullaby, but only one.

18:44.280 --> 18:49.080
Hairy little monkey, sleep
at night,

18:49.200 --> 18:54.280
Close your eyes so your monkey
monkey ... monkey eyes closed.

18:55.640 --> 19:00.000
And then would you know little
monkeys are not afraid.

19:00.120 --> 19:06.840
When you hear thunder boom.
So late into the night.

19:16.400 --> 19:19.640
- Paul, this Randall is a joke!
- Give him a chance.

19:19.760 --> 19:23.280
He will not show, you know.
Guy is a joke for NASA!

19:23.400 --> 19:26.680
I understand people like him.
He will be totally professional.

19:26.800 --> 19:29.160
Morning! Morning!

19:29.280 --> 19:31.160
Oh, well, Fred!

19:31.280 --> 19:35.240
We start your tests with
insulation chamber.

19:35.360 --> 19:40.400
In 24 hours we can see if you
can cope with the insulation of the space flight.

19:40.520 --> 19:44.720
Completely missed by all external
stimulus completely alone.

19:44.840 --> 19:48.400
Not entirely. Your competitors
will be in the House next.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.400
- Gordo!
- Sir.

19:51.200 --> 19:55.880
Hello, Gordon A. Peacock,
computer specialist!

19:56.000 --> 19:59.960
Okay, okay, is not it
here a real treat!

20:00.080 --> 20:01.680
What kind of laptop you have?

20:01.800 --> 20:04.280
- Randall, come on.
- Close off.

20:04.400 --> 20:08.240
Gordo, you are right;
Randall, in the left.

20:09.960 --> 20:13.080
Initializes the 24-hour clock.

20:39.240 --> 20:41.200
Hello?

20:42.920 --> 20:46.680
- What the hell?
- Is it you?

20:46.800 --> 20:49.440
Yes I am.

20:49.560 --> 20:51.680
Prove it!

20:51.800 --> 20:53.360
I asked you first!

20:53.480 --> 20:57.080
I asked you first.
I asked you first.

21:13.920 --> 21:17.200
John Jacob Jingle Heimer Schmidt

21:17.320 --> 21:20.600
His name is my name too.

21:20.720 --> 21:24.200
Whenever we go out screaming
People always like ...

21:24.320 --> 21:27.520
''John Jacob
Jingle Heimer Schmidt''

21:29.920 --> 21:33.240
He stopped.

21:34.880 --> 21:38.680
People always yell out
John Jacob Jingle Heimer ...

21:46.080 --> 21:48.120
Paul, he is not human.

21:55.080 --> 22:01.520
Freddy, it was just wonderful that you
invited us from London this weekend.

22:01.640 --> 22:05.720
Yes, it's wonderful
to be here, Freddy.

22:05.840 --> 22:09.760
It is my pleasure,
Mr. and Mrs. Plumpton.

22:17.720 --> 22:19.960
OK, Bill, let's get them out.

22:21.880 --> 22:23.800
Someone has stolen my pants.

22:25.760 --> 22:26.800
Yes, you did it.

22:26.920 --> 22:30.360
I did not do it, and
I swear that I never want to!

22:32.680 --> 22:37.560
Can you give me 5 minutes?
I've just started the third act.

22:37.680 --> 22:40.520
Close the door!
It's damn cold!

22:40.640 --> 22:45.440
- Yes, close the door, your fat ...
- Not in front of the children!

23:03.960 --> 23:05.840
Turn off the power.

23:05.960 --> 23:07.920
Turns off the power.

23:11.360 --> 23:14.800
- Gordo, good job!
- Well done, Gordo!

23:15.320 --> 23:18.200
Looks like he overcame
motion sickness.

23:18.320 --> 23:20.280
Good ride, guys!

23:20.880 --> 23:26.360
I would not have had it with liver sausage
and cheese sandwich just before.

23:37.680 --> 23:42.480
Randall, you know what that
iso chamber was child's play.

23:42.600 --> 23:44.560
This baby is a different matter.

23:44.680 --> 23:50.240
- How fast is spinning this thing?
- Almost ... 250km per hour.

23:50.360 --> 23:53.520
There are 6 G.
Bill which holds the world record.

23:53.640 --> 23:55.040
Have fun, kid.

23:55.160 --> 23:59.320
Ha is my Chinese neighbor
middle name!

24:09.120 --> 24:10.640
Tok!

24:10.760 --> 24:12.840
Take a quiet, Randall.

24:12.960 --> 24:14.920
Wait.

24:18.920 --> 24:21.640
Ok, let's try the 4G.

24:22.760 --> 24:24.720
No, five.

24:48.800 --> 24:50.560
Lite ...

24:51.120 --> 24:52.480
faster ...

24:53.960 --> 24:55.520
please.

24:56.280 --> 24:59.160
5.7 ... 5.8!

24:59.280 --> 25:01.160
Thanks ... so much!

25:01.280 --> 25:03.240
Six G!

25:06.160 --> 25:09.000
He is equal to your record,
Should I stop?

25:09.120 --> 25:11.360
- Give a little more gas!
- Take it to seven.

25:12.360 --> 25:15.640
Faster! Faster!

25:22.760 --> 25:26.280
Suffice ... Slow down ...

25:26.560 --> 25:28.840
Mom!

25:30.080 --> 25:31.840
I want my Mommy!

25:37.040 --> 25:39.600
And what is NASA's priority is children?

25:39.720 --> 25:41.320
Security!

25:45.560 --> 25:47.720
Father care who is in heaven ...

25:51.320 --> 25:55.680
Come on, Gary. What brave, what?
Why try not to go?

25:56.840 --> 25:58.200
Out of the way!

26:12.080 --> 26:13.920
Sorry I'm late.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.840
I ... ae ...

26:16.680 --> 26:19.120
I ran into Gary, and ...

26:20.640 --> 26:22.600
Sit in the chair, Fred.

26:25.120 --> 26:26.880
The second chair.

26:38.640 --> 26:43.960
capacitor 15 goes into 12 ...
Red to green ... over 19 ...

26:46.600 --> 26:50.160
17 into two, the red into the green ...
And that was it!

26:50.280 --> 26:53.560
Good Randall. Really good.

26:54.360 --> 26:56.920
The fastest time I've seen.

26:57.040 --> 27:00.520
I designed the most
of these circuits.

27:00.640 --> 27:02.600
How's it going?

27:04.240 --> 27:06.040
He can do it well!

27:06.160 --> 27:08.560
Let us try emergency situations.

27:08.680 --> 27:12.400
You have one minute to do it
or you die your crew.

27:18.760 --> 27:19.720
Start.

27:26.280 --> 27:29.240
You know what to do!
Do you doubt, you want to fail!

27:29.360 --> 27:32.000
Tak! Wall! Floor! You guys!

27:32.120 --> 27:33.960
It goes too fast!

27:34.080 --> 27:37.480
It is 100 times worse
in reality, come on!

27:39.160 --> 27:40.840
Randall ...

27:40.960 --> 27:43.440
Look at him! Randall!

27:43.560 --> 27:45.800
Randall, you're hopeless!

27:48.720 --> 27:50.680
How did it for me?

27:53.680 --> 27:55.920
A minute and 30 seconds.

27:56.320 --> 28:00.120
Remember, keep your pingpong
ball in the air as long as possible.

28:00.240 --> 28:02.320
This test lung capacity,

28:02.440 --> 28:06.000
to see how long you can survive
at life residence system error.

28:06.120 --> 28:10.600
The record is three minutes;
held by the Commander Overbeck.

28:10.720 --> 28:13.600
Ford, do me a favor.

28:14.040 --> 28:20.200
If for some miracle this guy
can do it ... look after him, would you?

28:20.920 --> 28:22.600
Sir.

28:22.720 --> 28:23.680
Hi, Ben.

28:23.800 --> 28:25.640
Bid.

28:25.760 --> 28:27.520
Bud!

28:28.240 --> 28:30.200
Can you excuse us?

28:33.600 --> 28:36.000
The closer to Bill's record.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.200
Bill, what do you think?

28:43.320 --> 28:46.120
I think Gordo is an astronaut
and Randall is not.

28:46.240 --> 28:48.640
I do not know.

28:59.400 --> 29:01.200
He broke the record!

29:14.360 --> 29:17.120
It was not me!
It was not me!

29:17.720 --> 29:23.320
So we will use a new
system generates artificial gravity.

29:24.400 --> 29:27.240
Ford, expect you to
find life on Mars?

29:27.360 --> 29:30.840
Absolutely. Together with my
crew, including Ulysses.

29:30.960 --> 29:35.600
I think we probably can find
microscopic multicellular organisms,

29:35.720 --> 29:38.520
resembled those found in
Antarctic.

29:38.640 --> 29:39.920
Bernard Barrow, BBC.

29:40.040 --> 29:44.320
Commander, we have all read
about dangerous wind storms.

29:44.440 --> 29:46.160
How will it affect the mission?

29:46.280 --> 29:48.560
Ok, as a former test pilot,

29:48.680 --> 29:51.680
I have experienced my share
of wind problems.

29:51.800 --> 29:56.840
But I had insurance to start now
these storms will not cause problems.

29:56.960 --> 29:58.360
Bernard Barrow, BBC.

29:58.480 --> 30:02.480
Mr. Wick, NASA has appointed a
replacement crew member yet?

30:02.600 --> 30:06.680
I'm glad you asked it.
Ben, would you answer that?

30:07.600 --> 30:12.280
Yes. I have taken a decision
at our place ...,

30:12.400 --> 30:16.960
And NASA

30:17.080 --> 30:20.520
is satisfied, and I am satisfied,

30:20.640 --> 30:25.760
to announce the appointment of
astronaut and the third member

30:25.880 --> 30:28.640
of this historic mission
to March,

30:28.760 --> 30:31.080
Astronaut Fred Randall!

31:33.920 --> 31:35.760
I'm not ready, Bud.

31:37.120 --> 31:42.040
Peace, 1968 when President Johnson
appointed me to head,

31:42.160 --> 31:44.680
He gave me three commemorative coins.

31:44.800 --> 31:47.440
One for glory, as he
gave to Armstrong.

31:47.560 --> 31:50.640
A to freedom, I gave
on to Lovell.

31:50.760 --> 31:54.320
And ... for heroism.

31:54.560 --> 31:58.920
It has not given me a lot.
Maybe it means something to you.

32:02.640 --> 32:05.280
I feel like the Cowardly Lion.

32:06.600 --> 32:09.240
If I ...

32:09.640 --> 32:12.000
Be King ...

32:12.560 --> 32:15.560
Out of the woods.

32:16.480 --> 32:20.880
I would be rough, and rough,
and more rough.

32:22.360 --> 32:27.160
How to just say, Thanks for the tough
coin, would mean a lot to me?

32:27.280 --> 32:30.560
Yes, thanks for the hard coin.
What was the other?

32:30.680 --> 32:33.600
Välbekommen, Fred.
Continue.

32:39.800 --> 32:42.360
Good luck, Astronaut Randall!

33:01.040 --> 33:04.800
OK, team, let's kick the tires
and ignite the rocket.

33:04.920 --> 33:08.320
Do not worry, Ulysses.
Everything will be fine.

33:08.440 --> 33:10.040
Nothing to be afraid of.

33:10.160 --> 33:12.880
I'm not afraid, so
why would you be?

33:13.000 --> 33:15.240
- What is your status?
- Go.

33:17.320 --> 33:20.800
- Roger, 842nd Booster?
- Go.

33:20.920 --> 33:22.440
-Apus?

33:22.560 --> 33:24.880
-Go.
- Looks good.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.840
Houston, we are approaching.
Initiates final checklist.

33:28.960 --> 33:31.200
- Fuel cells.
- Check.

33:31.320 --> 33:33.280
- Hydraulic.
- Check.

33:33.400 --> 33:35.880
- CDP, panel sixth
- MMU one.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.360
- IPO.
- AT & T?

33:38.480 --> 33:41.320
- TPC, Drive 4.
- KFC.

33:41.440 --> 33:43.320
- EDP.
- YMCA.

33:43.440 --> 33:45.520
- GNC and five.
- BMW?

33:45.640 --> 33:48.600
- CNS.
- CNN.

33:49.240 --> 33:51.960
- CNS.
- IHOP?

33:52.080 --> 33:56.480
- Randall, computer navigation system.
- I gotta pee!

33:58.200 --> 33:59.680
CNS, check.

33:59.800 --> 34:01.720
- EC-LSS.
- Check.

34:01.840 --> 34:05.520
- APU: P.
- APU's are OK. Emergency stop by.

34:05.640 --> 34:07.480
Initiates last boot sequence.

34:07.600 --> 34:11.840
Ok, people, looking good.
T minus ten, let's start her up.

34:11.960 --> 34:13.199
No, not yet!

34:13.320 --> 34:15.360
Ten ... nine ...

34:15.480 --> 34:17.880
-Fifteen! Twenty-nine!
- Seven ...

34:18.000 --> 34:21.639
There is a fly in my helmet!
It flew into my nose!

34:21.760 --> 34:25.159
Three ... two ... one ...

34:39.840 --> 34:43.159
We start 0232 GMT!

35:04.320 --> 35:05.720
Yes!

35:08.040 --> 35:09.800
Oh, dear God ...

35:09.920 --> 35:12.520
I hope I packed
enough underwear.

35:12.640 --> 35:16.960
Do not worry. He unpacks his
own underwear now.

35:32.120 --> 35:33.840
Golly ...

35:36.840 --> 35:38.720
Do you see this?

35:39.680 --> 35:41.640
My helmet!

35:43.080 --> 35:46.960
Did you see this?
My face was drawn back like this,

35:47.080 --> 35:51.880
and then flew this thing
out of my mouth and ...

35:52.760 --> 35:55.080
Can we do it again?

35:55.720 --> 35:58.240
I like this!

36:03.840 --> 36:09.080
I float in the air!
As a small bird, a crow!

36:10.760 --> 36:14.040
Hey, look, where a large
corn fields down there!

36:14.160 --> 36:18.200
Turns on artificial gravity
three ... two ... one.

36:26.000 --> 36:29.480
Randall, take a look through the box.

36:36.680 --> 36:39.840
It certainly looks as
a giant blueberry.

36:40.960 --> 36:42.840
Hi, Mom.

36:42.960 --> 36:44.720
Hi, Dad.

36:47.520 --> 36:50.920
- Captain, may I call you Bill?
- No.

36:51.040 --> 36:53.640
- Are we there now?
- No.

36:53.760 --> 36:55.960
- Can I drive?
- No!

36:56.080 --> 36:57.960
I'm hungry.

36:58.080 --> 37:01.760
Ulysses, it is time YUM-YUM!

37:05.520 --> 37:07.560
Oh, the skin, it burns!

37:08.600 --> 37:11.440
Need ointment for burns.

37:20.160 --> 37:25.880
Are you hungry, Ulysses? Here, eat
fruit cake. Now go and sit at the table.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.920
Sit at the table.

37:28.040 --> 37:30.080
Randall, where's dinner?

37:30.840 --> 37:34.000
It comes out of the oven, Bill.

37:35.160 --> 37:40.840
Let's eat. About 20 minutes we have a consignment
to the president and the entire free world.

37:40.960 --> 37:44.320
If it does not matter;
I do not want to be with.

37:44.440 --> 37:45.760
So what's for dinner?

37:45.880 --> 37:49.440
Ribs with broccoli and
mashed potatoes.

37:52.680 --> 37:55.520
Look, Julie makes her
Old Yeller imitation!

37:55.640 --> 37:59.840
Please, Dad, ...
I do not want Yeller to die!

38:01.400 --> 38:04.240
Fred, it's toothpaste!

38:13.120 --> 38:16.400
- It's not potatoes.
- I'm sorry, what?

38:16.520 --> 38:18.840
This is not ...

38:20.320 --> 38:23.920
Bloody hell! it is hemorrhoids ointment!

38:24.640 --> 38:26.760
Hemorrhoids ointment!

38:32.120 --> 38:35.120
Hello, swallow your food there, buddy!

38:40.360 --> 38:43.720
Dear Mr. ... ... President ...

38:45.080 --> 38:47.640
Dear World, and Mr. President ...

38:55.120 --> 38:57.120
It came from nowhere.

39:00.560 --> 39:02.520
Watch out Sally!

39:04.400 --> 39:06.760
Careful so you do not become
extracted down you flush.

39:06.880 --> 39:08.880
- What?
- Happens all the time.

39:32.160 --> 39:34.120
Oh no, Buds coins!

39:41.800 --> 39:43.640
Come to daddy ...

39:54.720 --> 39:58.200
Good evening, America,
and people all over the world.

39:58.320 --> 40:03.120
We have the privilege to talk to
our brave astronauts in March.

40:03.240 --> 40:04.800
Good evening, Commander.

40:04.920 --> 40:08.520
Good evening, Mr. President.
Welcome aboard Aries.

40:08.640 --> 40:11.320
I would say that this
mission is to

40:11.440 --> 40:14.280
honor all people on Earth,

40:14.400 --> 40:17.320
space is about the maximum desire

40:17.440 --> 40:21.040
- Are we in the picture?
- ... Of humanity.

40:21.160 --> 40:24.000
Excuse me for interrupting you,
Commander.

40:24.120 --> 40:26.360
but I see Fred Randall,

40:26.480 --> 40:30.720
and I think the world would
know why he looks like a smurf.

40:30.840 --> 40:33.760
Officer Randall has other
information to be taken care of.

40:33.880 --> 40:35.800
We are on the air!

40:35.920 --> 40:39.200
- As I said ...
- Say hello to the world.

40:39.880 --> 40:43.960
I? Yes, Mr. President ...

40:44.080 --> 40:48.240
- I do not think I ...
- Tell them what it's like up here.

40:48.360 --> 40:50.360
Yes, go ahead.

40:50.480 --> 40:54.600
Mr. President, sir, up
from here I can ...

40:54.720 --> 40:58.880
Ok, I can see the whole world
from the window, and ...

40:59.000 --> 41:04.120
I know down there where it is
a lot of wars and stuff,

41:04.240 --> 41:09.520
but up from here, I feel that
I can take the whole world in my hand

41:09.640 --> 41:13.000
just like a ripe blueberries.

41:14.440 --> 41:18.000
I feel that I can ...
Almost like I have ...

41:18.560 --> 41:22.160
I have the whole world in my hands.

41:22.280 --> 41:25.560
I have the whole world in my hands.

41:25.680 --> 41:28.800
I have the whole world in my hands.

41:28.920 --> 41:33.920
I have the whole world in my hands.
Ok, now French!

41:43.880 --> 41:45.560
Now the Germans!

41:53.440 --> 41:55.920
Come on, only the Western Hemisphere!

41:56.040 --> 41:59.920
- He has the whole world in his hands.
- Come on, Commander!

42:00.040 --> 42:03.880
He has the whole wide world
in their hands.

42:04.000 --> 42:07.640
He has the whole damn
world in their hands.

42:07.760 --> 42:10.920
He has the whole world in his hands.

42:11.040 --> 42:12.400
Everybody, now!

42:12.520 --> 42:16.080
He has the whole world in his hands.

42:26.000 --> 42:30.040
Now the Chinese!
Come on, all you Chinese!

43:00.280 --> 43:02.840
- Hey, where's my star.
- What?

43:02.960 --> 43:07.920
My star. When I was a boy,
I chose one in heaven.

43:08.040 --> 43:10.040
Called the Peace's star.

43:10.160 --> 43:15.480
It was my special place that I
could go to and nobody could find me.

43:15.600 --> 43:19.480
- It's so strange! I did that too.
- Did you?

43:19.600 --> 43:22.760
- Yes!
- What's yours?

43:22.880 --> 43:28.120
Ok, actually it is it, exactly
to the right of Polaris.

43:28.240 --> 43:30.280
Like flashing over there?

43:30.400 --> 43:32.160
- It's funny.
- Why?

43:32.280 --> 43:34.880
On the right beside me ....

43:38.560 --> 43:41.840
It ... It's amazing,
is not it, Julie?

43:41.960 --> 43:42.960
Yes.

43:43.080 --> 43:45.960
You know what, for
research I have done,

43:46.080 --> 43:49.480
Do I still
what's out here.

43:49.600 --> 43:53.240
I mean, I think it
is something ...

43:54.200 --> 43:56.680
I wish ... I wish ... I ....

43:56.800 --> 43:58.520
Do not you?

43:58.640 --> 43:59.640
What?

43:59.760 --> 44:05.840
Wish, use your star. It is
like that benjamin cricket song.

44:31.160 --> 44:33.360
It is benjamin cricket.
Bengt Feldreich''Donald Duck''July

44:39.200 --> 44:42.280
I'm not so sure
This hyper-sleep thing.

44:42.400 --> 44:46.720
It is safe, you can not stay
awake for eight months, you're crazy.

44:46.840 --> 44:51.680
8 months? Only eyes gravel
can be dangerous! Hey, Captain!

44:52.480 --> 44:54.560
It burns skin!

44:55.360 --> 44:58.520
Anyway, Ford, wake
me that we have come to Mars.

44:58.640 --> 45:00.440
All right.

45:00.560 --> 45:02.440
Goodnight, Ladies.

45:02.560 --> 45:05.000
See you in 8 months.

45:05.120 --> 45:10.480
I wish I had $ 928 for
every time a girl told me.

45:10.920 --> 45:12.680
Good night, Fred.

45:14.240 --> 45:16.200
Good night, Julie Ford.

45:25.320 --> 45:28.680
Okay, it's an old story;
Ulysses.

45:29.240 --> 45:31.840
Boy meets girl;
boy falls for girl;

45:32.320 --> 45:34.600
girl falls into hypersöm.

45:38.520 --> 45:43.560
No, you can not be in there
Therefore you are here reviewed.

45:43.680 --> 45:46.160
This is mine.

45:46.280 --> 45:49.920
Ok, I go in here.
You can stay there,

45:50.040 --> 45:53.400
I'll take your, your hairy
small bed thief!

45:53.520 --> 45:56.400
Good night.
Will only close the door ...

45:56.520 --> 45:59.840
Just close this ...

46:02.800 --> 46:05.280
Must close this door ...

46:40.440 --> 46:43.480
8 months old DRAKE.

46:50.400 --> 46:53.960
Good morning and hallelujah,
Commander!

47:12.440 --> 47:15.720
Question.
How long have I been asleep?

47:17.200 --> 47:19.000
Thirteen minutes?!

48:08.760 --> 48:12.320
Crazy sheets!
No man can sleep with you!

48:27.600 --> 48:30.920
Fall asleep. Fall asleep.
Fall asleep. Fall asleep.

48:39.120 --> 48:41.800
My darling, what
wonderful evening.

48:41.920 --> 48:46.000
You look so beautiful tonight
... so full of life.

48:46.120 --> 48:49.800
Your hair looks like silk,

48:49.920 --> 48:53.480
soft, milky white skin and
your red lips ...

48:53.600 --> 48:55.560
And your ...

49:11.440 --> 49:14.560
Hello! it's me again!

49:16.080 --> 49:18.720
Wake up, wake up,
wake up, wake up!

49:19.320 --> 49:22.080
Come out, Fred.
You can not hide forever, Peace.

49:22.200 --> 49:26.040
- They will take me, Fred.
- Bwana! It's me, Fred.

49:26.160 --> 49:30.000
They have taken over the ship.
Fifty, sixty of them!

49:30.640 --> 49:33.600
I had to hide in the jungle.
Note this.

49:33.720 --> 49:37.520
I need 4pcs kegs of gunpowder,
a machete, a goat

49:37.640 --> 49:39.600
a guide who speaks Hutu ...

49:39.720 --> 49:44.560
Fred, came out of it.
Fred, came out of it.

49:44.840 --> 49:46.560
It was not me!

50:34.720 --> 50:37.160
Hello? Hello?

50:37.800 --> 50:39.080
Hello?

50:39.200 --> 50:40.840
Fred?

50:40.960 --> 50:43.040
May I ask who is speaking?
- Over.

50:43.160 --> 50:46.280
It's Bud.
Go over to the private medical channel.

50:46.400 --> 50:48.920
- Bud, where have you been?
- Why are you awake?

50:49.040 --> 50:52.040
A series of very bad mistakes
happened all at once,

50:52.160 --> 50:54.720
but everything is fine now and
my mood is good.

50:54.840 --> 50:59.360
The ship is just fine and Hutu
the uprising is over. Over.

50:59.480 --> 51:02.760
Ignore "Over Score".
How can I keep this from Wick?

51:02.880 --> 51:07.080
You do not I programmed on
hyper sleep monitors.

51:07.200 --> 51:09.880
Ration your food.
I'll do whatever I can.

51:10.000 --> 51:15.200
Bud, I saw over the last weather
overview photographs from Mars.

51:15.320 --> 51:16.960
What do you mean?

51:17.080 --> 51:21.880
I can not be sure, but I think
we may encounter some nasty storms.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.560
It is impossible.
Nobody has seen anything like that.

51:24.680 --> 51:26.920
I almost missed it myself.

51:27.040 --> 51:30.480
If you look at the segment 5 and 6
Valles Marineris on ...

51:30.600 --> 51:32.880
Way too low.
This can be bad.

51:33.000 --> 51:34.240
What should we do?

51:34.360 --> 51:38.160
Nothing, of Wick learns that you
is awake, he will explode

51:38.280 --> 51:42.480
With this new weather, will
him to reassess the mission.

51:42.600 --> 51:45.120
Re-evaluating the mission?
Absolutely.

51:45.240 --> 51:46.880
Ok, we continued eating.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.920
Look at these new prints.
The danger is real!

51:50.040 --> 51:51.920
I do not need to look
on anything.

51:52.040 --> 51:54.920
All my experts tell
me that everything is okay;

51:55.040 --> 51:59.200
and you tell me to reevaluate a
$ 40 billions and mission in a sense?

51:59.320 --> 52:00.280
That is correct.

52:00.400 --> 52:04.840
Bud, your emotions go down as one
floss at a Willie Nelson concert.

52:04.960 --> 52:08.280
I'll keep an eye on this.
If the data does not change ...

52:08.400 --> 52:12.360
So leave it to me for
to make a decision, as always.

52:28.920 --> 52:31.120
February, March, April, May, June,

52:31.240 --> 52:35.160
July, August ...
Time to wake up.

52:35.280 --> 52:37.240
Hyper Sleep over.

52:37.680 --> 52:39.880
Come on Ford, I'm starving!

52:40.000 --> 52:42.040
Randall, why are you dressed like that?

52:43.840 --> 52:45.160
What have you done?

52:45.280 --> 52:48.520
Just made coffee.
I am a morning person.

52:48.640 --> 52:50.040
Good morning, Julie.

52:50.160 --> 52:52.040
What happened here?

52:52.160 --> 52:57.440
Ok, I will be the first to say it.
It looks like we've got space rats.

52:57.560 --> 52:59.280
Space rats?

52:59.400 --> 53:00.440
You have been awake!

53:00.560 --> 53:04.720
No! It was not me!
It was the hairy one!

53:04.840 --> 53:06.960
He! The naughty one!

53:12.400 --> 53:17.640
It is obvious that he was sorry
about it and do not want to talk about it.

53:18.760 --> 53:20.640
Oh, my God ...

53:31.600 --> 53:39.160
It has been shown that Ulysses is a
of these geniuses ... ... painting monkeys.

53:39.320 --> 53:41.120
It is food.

53:41.240 --> 53:45.000
You've been awake all the time and
used up all our food!

53:46.360 --> 53:50.040
What should we do now, go fishing?

53:50.160 --> 53:52.960
Look! Look! It's gone!
We are lost!

53:53.080 --> 53:55.440
I have spare supplies ...

53:55.560 --> 53:59.600
And what have we here?
Anchovy paste. I love it!

53:59.720 --> 54:02.720
- Liver cream! It is good.
- It's good for your gums.

54:02.840 --> 54:06.040
Fish balls!
I do not eat fish cakes!

54:06.160 --> 54:07.440
- Bill.
- What?

54:07.560 --> 54:09.520
We're here.

54:37.920 --> 54:40.120
Okay, kids, here we go.

54:40.720 --> 54:43.760
Randall, stop eating and
Pay attention.

54:43.880 --> 54:47.680
We have separation.
Request clearance for landing.

54:47.800 --> 54:49.880
Clear, Pilgrim. Verify separation.

54:50.000 --> 54:51.480
Over and out.

54:51.600 --> 54:54.480
The separation confirmed.
You have clear evidence for the landing.

54:54.600 --> 54:56.960
Understood. Start of ignition.

55:07.960 --> 55:10.920
Pilgrim is through the high door
80%

55:11.040 --> 55:12.080
Status?

55:12.200 --> 55:15.320
Aero-Shell-developed,
acceleration speed to normal.

55:15.440 --> 55:17.480
Now enter the Martian atmosphere.

55:20.680 --> 55:23.040
We have a problem!
Glide path and growing!

55:23.160 --> 55:24.560
I see it, Ford.

55:27.520 --> 55:28.960
We lose stability!

55:34.320 --> 55:36.680
-No, wait, wait ...
- I need numbers!

55:36.800 --> 55:38.360
10% no, 12%!

55:38.480 --> 55:39.640
Projectile path wound!

55:39.760 --> 55:43.160
- Is it 10 or 12?
- I agree on 12.

55:43.280 --> 55:46.640
Initializing 12% gimbal correction.

55:47.760 --> 55:51.480
Communications disruption
for three minutes.

56:00.840 --> 56:02.840
I knew it was 12.

56:10.240 --> 56:12.320
Lord dammit.

56:13.480 --> 56:15.360
Look at it.

56:24.520 --> 56:26.560
Starts landing rocket engines.

56:27.160 --> 56:30.280
It's OK, little buddy.
It will go well.

56:32.320 --> 56:34.480
Pilgrim, this is Houston.

56:35.680 --> 56:37.480
Pilgrim, can you hear us?

56:39.160 --> 56:42.960
Pilgrim, this is Houston.
Come in.

56:44.040 --> 56:47.960
Houston, this is Planitia base.
Pilgrim has landed.

57:03.200 --> 57:05.800
Commander Overbeck
leaving the capsule,

57:05.920 --> 57:09.080
and within a few seconds will
to stand on the surface of Mars

57:09.200 --> 57:11.480
and into the history books.

57:12.520 --> 57:15.440
This is a great day for us, leg.
Very High.

57:15.560 --> 57:20.600
Mr. President, the world's peoples, from
a poor farm boy from Iowa

57:20.720 --> 57:23.440
it is a really great honor to
be the first one ...

57:24.200 --> 57:28.800
- Fred, take a quiet ...
- ... to set foot on Mars.

57:32.840 --> 57:34.040
It was not me!

57:34.880 --> 57:38.520
Randall, I'll kick you in the ass!

57:54.760 --> 57:58.160
- Golly!
- It's incredible!

57:58.720 --> 58:01.400
We are the first
ever been on Mars!

58:01.520 --> 58:03.800
Now you're the biggest idiot
the two planets.

58:03.920 --> 58:07.120
We are the first to speak in March!

58:07.240 --> 58:11.480
Hi, Julie, I'm the first to
walk backwards on Mars!

58:13.200 --> 58:15.440
The first to give a kiss on Mars!

58:17.080 --> 58:19.560
Hello, you're the first
blush on Mars.

58:20.480 --> 58:23.560
How would you like to be the
first to die on Mars?

58:23.680 --> 58:27.520
Excuse me, He who was first to
display unwarranted anger on Mars!

58:27.640 --> 58:30.400
I do not listen.
I turn off my radio.

58:30.520 --> 58:34.200
You are the first that was not
listen to me in March.

58:34.320 --> 58:36.560
Please talk to me.

58:36.680 --> 58:40.080
I want to know more about you
the first time in March.

58:45.400 --> 58:47.560
- Are we there now?

58:47.680 --> 58:49.680
- Can I drive?
- No!

58:49.800 --> 58:50.880
You let me never to run!

58:51.000 --> 58:52.760
Shut up.

58:52.880 --> 58:56.000
Hey, there's no airbag.
I can fly out through the windshield?

58:56.120 --> 58:58.480
There is no windshield.

58:58.600 --> 59:02.240
Okay, but if I could fly
through the visor on my helmet?

59:02.360 --> 59:04.320
I die happy.

59:07.160 --> 59:10.040
Here it is.
Valles Marineris.

59:10.160 --> 59:13.720
Stay here, Ford.
This will be perfect.

59:14.360 --> 59:17.520
- This is where we place the flag.
- Copy that.

59:17.640 --> 59:22.560
I put up the weather station,
come back in an hour.

59:26.400 --> 59:30.960
I unload this equipment.
We met up here at 1400th

59:31.080 --> 59:32.800
1400, clearly.

59:32.920 --> 59:35.160
Be careful out there, Ford.

59:41.440 --> 59:46.360
Okay, this is the place.
It is the perfect place here.

59:46.480 --> 59:48.360
Randall, where's the flag?

59:48.480 --> 59:50.720
It will, Commander.

59:54.640 --> 59:58.000
It was not me! But I got it!

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.600
You idiot!

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:10.600
Who are you talking to?

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:13.440
Do you understand what you've just done?

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:18.840
I've waited my whole life to
place a flag on another planet!

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:22.760
Now I'm on another planet,
which was the hard part;

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:26.160
and I do not have a flag,
'Because you lost it'!

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:29.000
Do not worry, I have another option.

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:34.680
A high-flying flag of a proud flag!
A wonderful option!

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:36.120
What are you doing?

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:38.680
We are making history, Commander.

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:46.960
ATTENTION

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.200
It is the president.

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:59.320
Why do I throw myself not
just out of this rock?

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:02.840
- Why do not I throw you out?
- Do not worry, they are clean.

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:07.320
We have had a red mark on
Overbeck.

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:10.760
The oxygen tank is leaking.
We must preserve his SOP.

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:11.880
Solutions?

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.040
Emergency tube.
Pair him with another costume.

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:16.840
Do it, doc.

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:19.880
Bill, this is Houston.
You have a leak in your primary tank.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.440
I understand.
What do we do?

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:25.680
Connect to your emergency hose
by Randall

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:28.760
additional valve and divide until
you come back to Pilgrim.

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:31.520
Houston, this is hygienic?

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:35.640
Hello, Captain?

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:36.720
Yes?

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:40.000
Do you believe in UFOs at all?

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:42.000
Sure, I think I on UFOs

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:43.080
Do you?

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.920
Yes. There is one who follows me.

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:50.040
Oh, I get it!
Really fun, Commander!

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:57.680
- Hello, Captain?
- Yes?

01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:02.640
When I was a little boy, at night thought
I think it was a baker in my bed.

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:05.760
Did you ever think that there were
anything under your bed?

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:06.840
No.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:09.280
You never bent down and looked?

01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:10.480
No.

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:13.440
How did you know that there was a
bakers in your bed?

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:15.320
Randall, shut up.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.240
Hello, Captain?

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:18.560
Huh?

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:22.720
I seem to have any significant
intestinal cramps.

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:26.080
Randall, I'm trying to
save oxygen here.

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:27.440
But it hurts so much!

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:28.720
Keep it to yourself.

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:35.640
I think it takes 20 minutes
until we see Pilgrim.

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:47.800
Huh?
I have not done anything.

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:57.120
Oh, my God ...
Do not do it ... No, no ...

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:01.520
Oh, damn!

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:08.440
- It was not me.
- What do you mean?

01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:12.160
We are 35 million mil from
the nearest person!

01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:16.280
The heart rate up, your adrenaline up,
abdominal muscle spasms!

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:19.320
- Overbeck is in distress.
- Look at these levels of methane gas.

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:20.800
Methane?

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:30.760
Oh, it's in my mouth!

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:33.240
Hello, He who said it did!

01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:44.480
What?

01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:00.800
I have problems breathing.

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:05.000
Do you have trouble breathing?
My eyes burn!

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.080
Honestly, it was not me!
Maybe it was Julie.

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:11.080
- You bastard!
- Hey, miracles can happen.

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:12.720
Blame this on Julie!

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:15.000
OK, I admit it was me.

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:16.360
Thank you very much!

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:18.800
Now it was Julie!

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:31.840
It seems that Fred is right.
The winds come earlier.

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:35.080
Maybe two or three days.
Look at the data.

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:36.800
We should still be OK tomorrow.

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:39.600
Wait a second, no, it would not be OK!

01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:44.240
By my calculations, these
two low pressure systems ...

01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:48.560
come together much faster than
we could have counted on tomorrow.

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:52.880
And then we are no more a pond rat
in a dust bag.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.320
Do you go out there,
you do not return.

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:58.440
What are you, Randall?

01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:02.080
Is not it enough that you have violated
all records I have set,

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:04.840
you humiliated me
on television for the whole world,

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:09.320
and you ruined my highlight of my
life by stepping down on Mars first?

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:12.480
It is not enough for you!
You must do this!

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:16.920
No, this is my.
We came to Mars to collect fossil samples.

01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:20.320
We do not for me
have done it!

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:25.520
Bill, I do not want to stop the mission
more one you want, but ...

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:29.680
I know that he is right.

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:34.440
If we do not leave before the storm
will, we can not leave.

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:38.960
Okay, what do you suggest?

01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:43.600
Tomorrow we check the reading.
If they are bad ...

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:45.520
we finish.

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:48.560
All right.

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:51.320
Let's get some sleep.

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:02.520
- What did Overbeck?
- Wait until tomorrow.

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:07.320
Maybe I was wrong about the winds.
Maybe I should have kept quiet.

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:11.120
Let me tell you, Fred.
If the Apollo 13 mission.

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:16.320
The day before the start I saw a bug
in the tank whipping circuit.

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:22.000
It did not tell you sincerely, but
I told Wick that we would postpone.

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:25.120
He said it was not possible to
move the start date,

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:29.040
and that I overreacted,
imagined a problem.

01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:31.520
As Apollo 13 was Wicks wrong?

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:37.280
No. I had the responsibility to stop
launch, but I did not.

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:40.960
If not the ones the astronauts had
accomplished a miracle,

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:44.200
they had died, and the
would have been my fault.

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:49.520
I will not let this happen this time.
I'll be sure to get you out of this.

01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:53.440
Hey, Bud ...
I would be proud to be like you.

01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:56.640
I understood it.

01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:59.160
Bud end.

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:02.320
Mushroom people are coming!
Get them off!

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:05.520
Peace! Wake up! Peace!

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:09.600
Bill is gone. He took Ulysses and
reserve your backpack, and he is gone.

01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:11.560
Holy fat mother!

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:24.600
Okay, buddy, here we are.

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:29.120
Come on ... Come on ...

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:37.000
How are things going for them up there?

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:41.680
Morning, sir. We would just wake them.
Do you want this?

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:43.320
Oh, Great!

01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:49.560
It's over, Paul.
Sir, I lay down, we now adjourn.

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:52.360
Bud, do not do that I must
summoning the guards.

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:57.520
I will not allow another accident happens!
He ignored all warnings!

01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:01.160
- Running, would you come in here?
- Our mission is in jeopardy.

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:08.880
- Do not harder.
- Do not do this, sir.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.560
Bud, we are all under great stress.
You just need to rest.

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:14.560
Ben, those people will die.

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:17.279
Bud, you have totally lost it.

01:08:17.399 --> 01:08:19.760
We have not received any negative reports.

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:22.000
Get him out of here.

01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:25.880
Paul, we have a contact at a
distress frequency.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.080
On-screen.

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.000
Pilgrim, this is Houston.

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:34.200
Houston, the storm is here!
Wind strength is 90 mph and rising!

01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:37.080
- Siktbarheten drops.
- Houston, what should we do?

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:38.840
What shall we do!

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:40.760
Paul?

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:44.800
Randall, no, it's impossible.

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:46.279
Our weather analysis ...

01:08:46.399 --> 01:08:49.800
Mr. Wick, I have not seen
something like this.

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:51.920
It reminds me of
a French Canadian ...

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:53.920
Tennis racket stuck to a ...

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:56.560
Crashing out of my sister's ...

01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:57.800
Mild powers!

01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:00.080
I can not be any clearer!

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:02.640
Wick, get them away from where the planet!

01:09:03.279 --> 01:09:05.120
Do as he says, Paul.

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:08.240
Ben, we could not have known.

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:11.439
I followed this procedure, Ben.

01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:13.359
I followed the procedure

01:09:13.479 --> 01:09:15.160
Paul, unplug and go home.

01:09:15.279 --> 01:09:18.080
Unplug and go home?

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:20.359
Nesbitt, you have commanded.

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:26.279
- Houston, do you understand? Come in!
- We understand. Wait.

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:30.439
Do not stare at me!
We have a crew out there!

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:32.800
Let's bring them home.

01:09:46.439 --> 01:09:49.600
Houston, wind speed
continues to increase.

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:51.200
It's bad, Paul.

01:09:51.319 --> 01:09:53.319
Ford, it's Bud. Listen.

01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:58.000
If the wind continues to increase, if
20 minutes will start to be impossible.

01:09:58.120 --> 01:09:59.440
Push up now.

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:04.360
No! Commander Overbeck and
Ulysses is still out there!

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:12.840
They are lost now.
You are not there.

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:14.600
Start!

01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:16.560
- I go after them.
- What?

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:19.080
Fred? Peace, answer me! Peace!

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:22.480
Can not hear you!
Your signal is breaking up!

01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:27.840
If I'm not back in 20 minutes,
you must start without me!

01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:29.000
You'll be back.

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:31.560
20 minutes, and then we start!

01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:41.800
20 minutes, right?
Not 15 or something?

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:43.680
All right.

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:51.080
21 is OK, too.

01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:15.960
Ford, what happens?
I lose you! Julie!

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:18.640
Commander!

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:21.520
Commander Overbeck!

01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:24.960
Ulysses!

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.240
Where are you? Answer me!

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:40.280
There you are!

01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:44.000
I told you, do not go out in
a Martian sandstorm!

01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:46.360
We need to find the commander.

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:53.080
Where are they?

01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:56.920
Commander!

01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:59.720
Commander Overbeck!

01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:01.640
Randall?

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:03.640
Captain, are you?

01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:04.720
Randall!

01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:06.480
It is you!

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:10.400
OK, stand back, little buddy.
Nothing to see here.

01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:14.680
What are you doing here? Getting back
to the ship and save yourself!

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:16.680
Sorry, I can not do it.

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:18.480
That's an order!

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:20.480
I have to help you out.

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:22.480
I can not lift it.

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:25.240
They say when a mother's child
jammed,

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:28.520
give her the adrenaline
strength of 12 but.

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:31.640
- Captain, call me mom!
- What?

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:34.000
Call me mom now!

01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:36.520
I'd rather die in the Martian soil!

01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:39.680
- Who am I?
- Just lift the damn thing!

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:42.720
- Who am I?
- Mom.

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:44.600
Say that you love me.

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:51.760
Mom ... Please, Mommy, save me.

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:55.400
- Mom will, little Billy!
- Save me!

01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:58.520
Live, baby! Live!

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:03.360
You are in life, Little Billy!

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:06.000
Call me not little Billy!

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:08.680
There is no way to
talk to your mom.

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:12.160
- Houston, this is Ford.
- Julie, where's Fred?

01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:15.320
Still out there.
I initiated the start.

01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:18.680
They still have time!
Give them a chance!

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:20.760
I know what I do.

01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:25.640
Which way Commander?

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:29.520
Can not get any readings.
Take cover behind that rock.

01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:31.720
Come on, Ulysses.

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:35.080
I go out there and
take a closer look.

01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:38.880
The Pilgrim!

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.920
It's too late! She starts now!

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:45.120
She leads us to the engines!
Come on!

01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:47.400
I'll take Ulysses.

01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:51.400
The tank is empty!

01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:53.200
We share the air.

01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:55.600
We do not have an extra tube!

01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:59.400
Then I give him mine.
It does not leave anyone behind.

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:02.640
And what, you should hold your breath?
You'll never make it!

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:07.240
Do not forget, I'm the new NASA
record holder of lung capacity.

01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:12.720
It was three minutes!
This is, what, four, maybe five?

01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:17.640
You've ignored me the entire trip, and now
when I have no air left would you talk?

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:19.520
Randall ...

01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:31.040
Oh, no, not now!

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:37.600
20 minutes have passed.

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:40.280
Wait ... I see one!

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:42.280
Ford, what's going on?

01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:43.400
I have it!

01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:46.640
Ford, who is it?
Julie, can you hear us?

01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:50.440
Fred, are you there? Fred
Listen, anyone!

01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:52.440
Bill! Where's Fred?

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:55.720
He should be here.
Do not start.

01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:58.160
There he is!

01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:01.080
Peace ...
He goes the wrong way! Peace!

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:03.320
Hello! Peace!

01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:15.520
- Get me out of this!
- What are you doing?

01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:17.680
It's empty anyway

01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:21.400
- He keeps the spirit out here.
- Oh, My God!

01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:25.400
If I'm not back in 5 minutes ...

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:33.000
Faster! Faster!, Bill!

01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:42.800
Bill, is he OK?
Is he OK?

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:46.160
He's not breathing!
Take off his helmet!

01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:52.280
Did not think of it, Randall!

01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:57.680
Houston, this is the Pilgrim ...

01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:01.440
Carol Ann?
Go toward the light.

01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:03.680
Houston?

01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:07.320
Oh it's you! Ulysses!

01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:09.080
No! Julie!

01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:11.320
No. ... Ulysses need air!

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.680
Houston! Come in!
We are on board.

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:18.960
- We must make clear to start.
- Get it from there!

01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:22.040
Roger, preparing take-off.

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:23.880
Not the hairy! Take me!

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.000
- Loading the main engine.
- Rocket engine intact.

01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:32.960
Fred? Peace!
He's OK! He was just resting.

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:36.040
Rocket engines are started at three, two ...

01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:37.760
- Hold on.
- ... One.

01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:43.080
We have lift.

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:44.760
50 meters.

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:46.720
100th

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:48.800
- Increases the speed.
- 200 meters.

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:53.880
The course is good.
Good flier, Uncle walnut.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.120
One thousand ... two thousand ...

01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:57.800
Increases the speed.

01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:00.080
Five thousand ... Six thousand ...

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:04.520
Eight-thousand.
- You are almost free from the storm.

01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:06.360
Ten thousand.

01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:11.400
- All systems green.
- I think we did it.

01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:19.840
What the hell what?

01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:24.120
- Houston, we had a collision!
- It was not me!

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:28.120
- The controls are compromised!
- Go over to backup power.

01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:30.120
- We lose speed.
- Status!

01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:34.000
EC-LSS down, OMS, down, down communication.
Everything is totally dead.

01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:35.280
Solutions!

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:38.960
Randall connects the entire circuit
for two minutes.

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:40.880
Bud, what are we doing here?

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.600
We do nothing.

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:44.600
Pilgrim is in free fall.

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:51.040
Navigation controls excluded.
I need engine computers now!

01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:54.040
This time it was definitely not me!

01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:56.720
Switches to manual.
Look down there.

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:02.360
Randall, what's it like down there?

01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:03.840
So here!

01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:07.280
Fix it!

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:09.840
Stop the ship spinning
and give me a week!

01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:12.040
You have two minutes!

01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:19.360
To summarize, the Pilgrim was
caught in a violent sandstorm

01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:22.160
and are now falling now down to March.

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:27.440
We are waiting for NASA's latest
news of this terrible accident.

01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:31.320
4500 feet, descending rapidly.

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:33.560
90 seconds to strike.

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:35.840
Say it bluntly, can he do it?

01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:39.840
Only a computer genius or a
total idiot can do this.

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:41.840
Luckily for us he is both.

01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:49.000
Someone force yet, Bill?

01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:51.360
Nothing. We are in a flat spin.

01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:02.280
This would be a good time to fix it!
Anytime would be good!

01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:07.200
- 60 seconds to strike. The systems are red.
- We have audio link.

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:08.440
Fred?

01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:10.320
Fred, can you hear me?

01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:13.760
Bud ... I'm down in the hull.
Everything is spinning.

01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:15.120
I do not know what to do!

01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:20.160
Focus. It's like training.
The rotating chair with wires.

01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:22.880
- It was really a winner!
- You can do it.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.760
Trust your instincts.

01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:30.120
Now!

01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:36.560
Fred, come on, you can do it.

01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:38.880
30 seconds! Give not up, Fred!

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:40.400
Come on!

01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:47.000
Must hook up the circuit.

01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:54.360
- Come on, Fred.
- 15 seconds to strike.

01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:56.360
need something ...

01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:59.720
You are the man!
Come on.

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:01.240
Ten seconds!

01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:04.680
- Buds coins!
- Come on!

01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:13.000
We have power!

01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:19.400
You did it, Fred!

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:29.000
Light the lamp on the front porch, Mom!
We get home!

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:47.680
Oh, Magoo.
You've done it again, sir!

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:04.480
That little space rock will
make you really famous, Julie Ford.

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:08.160
So what should you do now, raketman?

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:13.200
Actually, I thought the case
if you want to dance.

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:18.000
Thanks, but I think we have
done it before.

01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:23.360
Wait, I've had little time for me
myself lately, I've trained.

01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:27.880
That and I've been a little creative
with space sheets.

01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:30.040
When you wish ...

01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:33.720
More than a star

01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:37.680
Your dreams ...

01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:40.480
Will ...

01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:43.120
true ...

01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:48.800
Pleasant dreams, darlings.

01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:52.760
So, we have seen in eight months.

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:54.680
Good night, Fred.

01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:11.920
It's a story old as time,
Ulysses.

01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:14.000
Boy meets girl ...

01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:16.520
boy falls for girl;

01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:19.040
boy and girl returns
to their home planet,

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:23.080
get a nice house with a fence
and live happily ...

01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:24.160
No!

01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:29.920
No, not again! Ulysses! No!
