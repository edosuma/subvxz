01:46.983 --> 01:48.416
My period's late.

01:59.829 --> 02:00.930
Hello. Can I come in?

02:00.963 --> 02:01.964
Hello.

02:02.899 --> 02:04.033
- Here we are.
- Hello.

02:04.066 --> 02:06.035
There's a nice little scene.

02:06.068 --> 02:07.870
Dogs waiting for lunch.

02:08.937 --> 02:09.939
Ah.

02:10.604 --> 02:11.808
You had any rest?

02:13.109 --> 02:14.409
Poor old you.

02:15.044 --> 02:16.679
What a shock.

02:16.712 --> 02:18.815
Terrible shock. Sorry.

02:21.449 --> 02:23.786
Did you know what was
going on with this chap?

03:00.555 --> 03:01.656
What's wrong with that?

03:06.729 --> 03:07.864
You're the boss.

03:16.504 --> 03:17.672
Is she coming?

03:20.209 --> 03:21.543
Darling?

03:26.481 --> 03:27.549
Here we go.

03:34.156 --> 03:35.423
- You ready for this?
- Hello.

03:35.457 --> 03:36.759
I like the pajamas.

03:36.792 --> 03:38.627
- They're not pajamas.
- Oh.

03:38.660 --> 03:40.062
Well, they're
very nice anyway.

03:49.906 --> 03:51.040
What are you doing?

03:51.073 --> 03:52.674
Oi, stop it.

03:55.711 --> 03:57.512
They want to go
for a walk.

03:58.480 --> 03:59.581
That's what they're doing.

03:59.614 --> 04:00.783
Help yourself.

04:02.785 --> 04:03.986
Hello there.

04:07.023 --> 04:10.059
I hope you're gonna stay
for a very long time.

04:10.092 --> 04:11.827
Long as possible,
my darling.

04:11.861 --> 04:13.095
Absolutely.

04:23.706 --> 04:24.874
You want some?

04:53.269 --> 04:57.873
<i>♪ Will there be another time</i>

04:57.907 --> 05:02.011
<i>♪ Will there be another time</i>

05:02.044 --> 05:04.880

05:04.914 --> 05:07.917

05:11.253 --> 05:15.758

05:15.791 --> 05:19.862

05:19.895 --> 05:22.765

05:22.798 --> 05:25.667
<i>♪ Another wish to stay? ♪</i>

06:29.198 --> 06:31.267
<i>You grow green grass

06:33.335 --> 06:37.873
<i>...with showers

06:42.812 --> 06:45.714

round to Julie at the moment.</i>

07:01.931 --> 07:05.167
<i>She's going to be explaining
it as we go over the...</i>

07:05.201 --> 07:07.069
<i>I think we'll...</i>

07:34.363 --> 07:36.232
Thank you
for coming to see us.

07:44.406 --> 07:45.941
I brought you
the last of his things.

07:45.975 --> 07:46.976
Oh...

07:54.116 --> 07:57.686
I mean, you know, I'm just
reading this book. Um...

07:57.720 --> 07:59.455
Jack Pincher book
and, you know,

07:59.488 --> 08:02.925
all these people
that have led double lives.

08:02.958 --> 08:05.027
And, you know, I...

08:05.060 --> 08:08.330
You know, I'm just hoping
that I can find a reference

08:08.364 --> 08:10.399
to a friend of his
or something in there

08:10.432 --> 08:14.470
that will give me
a little hope that...

08:14.503 --> 08:16.872
That there is some involvement
at the foreign office.

08:16.906 --> 08:18.073
I mean, it would...

08:18.107 --> 08:21.443
I can't seem
to find out anywhere

08:21.477 --> 08:24.914
in the foreign office
to talk to even, you know.

08:24.947 --> 08:26.282
I mean, he was...

08:26.315 --> 08:28.851
He didn't talk to us
about his work, did he?

08:33.087 --> 08:34.857
Was he worrying
about anything,

08:34.890 --> 08:36.859
do you know? No?

08:36.892 --> 08:37.960
No.

08:44.232 --> 08:47.203
James had to identify him.

08:49.205 --> 08:51.440
It just... It just
didn't look like him. I...

08:53.776 --> 08:57.446
I... I found it very hard
to accept that it was him.

09:02.851 --> 09:04.453
There's a little present
for you.

09:11.794 --> 09:13.195
He looks exactly the same.

09:17.900 --> 09:19.835
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

09:43.993 --> 09:45.794
- Hello, Julie?
- Yes.

09:45.828 --> 09:47.763
- Do come in.
- Thank you.

09:51.867 --> 09:54.036
Seems
to me he was quite dark

09:55.137 --> 09:57.339
in his nature anyway.

09:57.373 --> 10:01.210
Uh, I would wager that you two
had more disagreements

10:01.243 --> 10:03.579
than you had had
for the period of time.

10:03.612 --> 10:05.514
Let's go six months back.

10:05.547 --> 10:07.149
You'd had more disagreements.

10:07.182 --> 10:10.986
Not necessarily battles royal,
but disagreements.

10:11.020 --> 10:13.389
And in that time,
while he was struggling,

10:13.422 --> 10:17.526
he was working on a thought.
A conscious thought

10:17.559 --> 10:20.262
that he didn't know
how to go forward with life

10:20.296 --> 10:23.499
in this deception
that had become his life.

10:23.532 --> 10:26.135
Uh, and as I'm sitting here
talking to you,

10:26.168 --> 10:28.003
the way I'm getting
this information

10:28.037 --> 10:29.838
without invading
anybody's privacy

10:29.872 --> 10:31.540
is I'm asking myself,

10:31.573 --> 10:33.342
what do I know
about his last days?

10:33.375 --> 10:34.843
What happened to his moods?

10:34.877 --> 10:37.579
Did he have a reason
to go on at all?

10:37.613 --> 10:38.480
And I have the sense

10:38.514 --> 10:40.382
that at the end,
he had no reason to go on.

10:40.416 --> 10:44.219
He wanted to stop what was
going on in his own life,

10:44.253 --> 10:46.055
so he just did that.

10:46.655 --> 10:48.057
He let his life go.

10:50.326 --> 10:52.061
Action background!

10:57.266 --> 10:59.134
Yeah. Just a rehearsal.

10:59.168 --> 11:01.370
One, two, three, four,

11:01.403 --> 11:04.340
five, six, seven, eight...
One...

11:06.241 --> 11:08.377
- Yeah, there's a...
- Graham...

11:08.410 --> 11:11.113
...you know, there's
a challenge in that. Um...

11:11.146 --> 11:13.382
But also, it's just trying
to find a character that,

11:13.415 --> 11:16.118
you know, is layered.
Um, and...

11:16.151 --> 11:17.586
It's not necessarily
about the darkness,

11:17.619 --> 11:19.355
it's about why this person
is the way he is.

11:19.388 --> 11:21.990
You could say that it's also
a very political film.

11:22.024 --> 11:23.425
- Yes. Yeah.
- Right.

11:24.660 --> 11:26.028
Okay, I just...

11:26.662 --> 11:28.230
Uh, pause for a minute.

11:28.263 --> 11:30.532
Just to check something
on the camera.

11:34.303 --> 11:35.471
Julie's here.

11:36.438 --> 11:37.606
Hi, Julie.

11:37.639 --> 11:39.675
Carry on.
I don't wanna...

11:39.709 --> 11:41.110
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

11:41.143 --> 11:43.579
Good to see you!
Good to see you.

11:43.612 --> 11:45.314
- Great!
- Uh, Julie, Jim.

11:45.347 --> 11:46.515
- Hi. Jim.
- Hello. Julie.

11:46.548 --> 11:49.017
- We've met before.
- Nice to meet you. Oh, really?

11:49.051 --> 11:51.320
Um... Knightsbridge.

11:51.353 --> 11:53.055
Um, it was brief.

11:53.956 --> 11:55.424
Um...

11:55.457 --> 11:57.025
Sorry about your loss.

11:57.059 --> 11:58.093
Thank you.

11:58.127 --> 11:59.361
I, um...

11:59.395 --> 12:01.563
I'd met Anthony
a few times,

12:01.597 --> 12:04.400
and, uh,
he had a beautiful mind.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.235
He did.

12:09.438 --> 12:10.672
Julie, ready?

12:18.147 --> 12:20.349
Be careful of
all these cables, okay?

12:25.554 --> 12:27.055
- Okay...
- Thank you.

12:38.267 --> 12:40.102
One, two, three, four...

12:40.135 --> 12:41.303
Okay, lets hold it there.

12:41.336 --> 12:42.571
Cut! Cut! Cut!

12:45.441 --> 12:48.745
Okay, good.
Let's get it in pieces now.

12:48.778 --> 12:50.345
Jim, it's not linear.

12:50.379 --> 12:52.648
Jim, it's... It's not linear,
in terms of the action...

12:52.682 --> 12:54.082
No, but I'm just
getting marking...

12:54.116 --> 12:55.184
...so you don't need
to repeat it.

12:55.217 --> 12:57.386
And I look like a...
I look like a fucking idiot.

12:57.419 --> 12:58.387
Just a minute to reload.

12:58.420 --> 13:00.522
So, guys, just a minute
while we reload camera.

13:00.556 --> 13:01.557
Is there
any chance of getting,

13:01.590 --> 13:04.126
say, another half dozen people
around this monitor?

13:04.159 --> 13:05.394
Okay, stand by.

13:08.130 --> 13:10.700
Each shot we can use.
Even if it's not the same.

13:10.733 --> 13:13.703
As long as you have
the same emotion.

13:13.736 --> 13:16.271
And roll playback...

13:18.607 --> 13:22.144
And one, two, three, four,

13:22.177 --> 13:25.347
five, six, seven, eight.
Again!

13:29.518 --> 13:32.087
Up, up...
Look at him.

13:32.588 --> 13:34.256
Okay, coming back.

13:34.289 --> 13:37.426
Five, six,
seven, eight... One...

13:37.459 --> 13:39.561
Continuing on
after the fixed point.

13:40.697 --> 13:42.531
And now come back. Come back.

13:42.564 --> 13:44.600
Just straight back,
straight back. Right.

13:44.633 --> 13:45.667
<i>I wanted to ask you</i>

13:45.702 --> 13:49.171
<i>why you decided
to do a musical today.</i>

13:49.204 --> 13:51.206
<i>Look at us.
We're in the pissing rain.</i>

13:51.240 --> 13:52.574
<i>Wouldn't you want to be</i>

13:52.608 --> 13:54.811
<i>on a sound stage
in widescreen,</i>

13:54.844 --> 13:56.211
<i>rather than here</i>

13:56.245 --> 13:58.514
<i>like every other fucking
English film ever made</i>

13:58.547 --> 14:00.082
<i>where it's drizzling?</i>

14:00.115 --> 14:01.550
<i>That's why.</i>

14:01.583 --> 14:05.287
<i>You know, to...
To show the kids some kind of life.</i>

14:05.320 --> 14:09.157
<i>To use the form,
to use movement,</i>

14:09.191 --> 14:12.294
<i>music, montage,</i>

14:12.327 --> 14:14.563
<i>rather than... Blegh...</i>

14:15.765 --> 14:17.165
<i>That's why.</i>

14:17.199 --> 14:19.468
<i>Right. Um...</i>

14:19.501 --> 14:22.170
<i>Would you say
it's a political musical?</i>

14:22.204 --> 14:25.274
<i>Everything's political.
Everything's political.</i>

14:25.875 --> 14:28.711
<i>Right. Done.</i>

14:28.745 --> 14:30.680
You can see
it's not a good time.

14:30.713 --> 14:32.214
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

14:32.247 --> 14:34.182
- We'll wait. It's fine.
- No. It's broken now.

14:34.216 --> 14:35.617
- Can I just have five minutes?
- Go on.

14:35.651 --> 14:38.654
I just wanted to ask you
a few questions about Anthony

14:38.688 --> 14:40.622
- and his work.
- Bad time.

14:41.758 --> 14:42.792
It's a bad time.

14:42.825 --> 14:44.126
You can go.

14:44.159 --> 14:46.562
Lydia, could you...
Could you...

14:48.831 --> 14:50.265
Make a memorial for him.

14:54.503 --> 14:55.604
Well, then, also to imagine

14:55.637 --> 14:57.874
that Black men are sort of
like some sort of animals.

14:57.907 --> 14:58.741
Then we see this girl,

14:58.775 --> 14:59.976
and suddenly we're like,
we turn into...

15:00.009 --> 15:02.244
Like lunatics and we're just,
like, obsessed with a woman.

15:02.277 --> 15:04.346
Yeah, the White guys
are the same though.

15:04.379 --> 15:06.114
Yeah, but it's...
Yeah, but I dunno... For me...

15:06.148 --> 15:07.817
It's more about the question,
I think, and, uh...

15:07.850 --> 15:10.118
Yeah, the colors
of the costume as well.

15:10.152 --> 15:11.353
They look like
cartoon characters.

15:11.386 --> 15:12.789
But you wanna contribute
to cinema, right?

15:12.822 --> 15:13.856
You wanna be something...

15:13.890 --> 15:15.123
I think... I really think

15:15.157 --> 15:17.192
he is contributing to cinema.
He is.

15:17.225 --> 15:18.828
Yeah, he's contributing shit,
is what he's contributing.

15:18.861 --> 15:20.495
Let's be real about it...

15:22.164 --> 15:23.632
I like when
you're like that.

15:23.665 --> 15:25.601
- Yeah, me, too.
- I'm just being honest.

15:25.634 --> 15:26.836
That bit of feistiness.

15:26.869 --> 15:28.838
I've bitten my tongue
for that entire day.

15:28.871 --> 15:29.839
- I was laughing.
- Oh, yeah?

15:29.872 --> 15:31.708
I was laughing along.
I thought... I said...

15:31.741 --> 15:33.508
I thought the commentary
was good, but I just...

15:34.677 --> 15:36.211
It's just one of them jobs

15:36.244 --> 15:38.146
that you've gotta
look after yourself.

15:38.180 --> 15:40.515
It's a trial by fire, mate.
That's what it is.

15:43.285 --> 15:45.287
Julie, have you had
a look at it?

15:45.320 --> 15:46.588
Have you seen
any of the rushes?

15:46.622 --> 15:47.623
- Yeah, a little bit.
- Yeah?

15:47.656 --> 15:49.458
- What do you think?
- Good. It looks good.

15:49.491 --> 15:51.593
It's just taking
a bit of time.

15:51.627 --> 15:52.895
Patrick's a bit hard work.

15:52.929 --> 15:55.163
He's giving him
a load of grief.

15:55.197 --> 15:56.766
You guys are not
very happy, though.

15:56.799 --> 15:58.533
- Pardon?
- You're not very happy.

15:58.567 --> 15:59.601
Yeah, I can see it, man.

15:59.635 --> 16:00.703
That's just
how it goes, innit?

16:00.737 --> 16:01.938
No, it's just
stressful, innit?

16:01.971 --> 16:03.271
It's got like... He's...

16:03.305 --> 16:04.206
We were saying earlier,
he's got

16:04.239 --> 16:05.808
this very romanticized idea
of what he wants

16:05.842 --> 16:07.542
without sort of
a proper sort of

16:08.510 --> 16:10.212
direction of
how to achieve it.

16:10.245 --> 16:11.080
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Mmm.

16:11.114 --> 16:12.314
Yeah, we could get
the sense of that.

16:12.347 --> 16:15.283
But it's coming,
it's trickling down to us because

16:15.317 --> 16:16.753
obviously, he's not getting
the shots that he wants.

16:16.786 --> 16:18.453
But when you're the people
in front of the camera,

16:18.487 --> 16:20.222
you feel like you're the ones
fucking up all the time.

16:20.255 --> 16:21.323
Mmm. Mmm.

16:21.356 --> 16:23.392
And more so on Jim,
bless him.

16:23.425 --> 16:24.660
Keeps taking him aside and...

16:24.694 --> 16:25.594
Pulling him aside,

16:25.627 --> 16:26.829
having chats with him
on his own and that...

16:26.863 --> 16:28.263
Two minutes
we're stood down,

16:28.296 --> 16:29.297
you know what I mean?

17:10.605 --> 17:11.606
Hello.

17:13.742 --> 17:14.911
Can I come in?

17:24.921 --> 17:26.288
I was in the area.

17:33.328 --> 17:34.496
Are you okay?

17:37.499 --> 17:38.667
Are you sure?

18:18.440 --> 18:19.508
Stop.

18:21.677 --> 18:22.845
I'm on my period.

18:26.716 --> 18:27.884
I don't mind.

21:28.264 --> 21:29.464
Thank you.

21:30.299 --> 21:31.767
Uh, Garance, the shoes.

21:43.611 --> 21:44.646
<i>Oui.</i>

21:49.085 --> 21:50.252
Okay.

21:50.286 --> 21:51.988
- We've got time.
- Okay.

21:52.021 --> 21:54.123
We've got time
because I'm very fast.

21:54.156 --> 21:56.125
You are very fast.

21:59.895 --> 22:01.030
Yeah, and again.

22:01.063 --> 22:02.098
Okay, watch out.

22:02.131 --> 22:03.833
- Yeah.
- <i>Ca va?</i>

22:03.866 --> 22:05.633
Come on, guys.
Let's go.

22:05.667 --> 22:07.203
- How much of the car...
- Mmm?

22:07.236 --> 22:08.237
How much of
the car do you want...

22:08.270 --> 22:09.005
Do you wanna get a mark
on the start as well?

22:09.038 --> 22:10.605
I... I want to be like...

22:13.342 --> 22:16.746
No, no, I know.

22:16.779 --> 22:18.247
Oh, notorious.
Okay, perfect.

22:18.280 --> 22:19.682
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:20.883 --> 22:22.251
Rehearsal, rehearsal.

22:22.284 --> 22:23.219
You're doubting yourself.

22:23.252 --> 22:23.986
I don't like it
and I won't let you do it.

22:24.020 --> 22:24.920
I won't let you do it!

22:24.954 --> 22:27.123
I've seen you.
I've seen what you can do.

22:27.156 --> 22:28.124
You have too much faith in me.

22:28.157 --> 22:29.992
I always say this!
I always say this. It's...

22:30.026 --> 22:31.894
Yeah, but it's not...
It's not grounded, like, in...

22:31.927 --> 22:34.130
In something false.
It's, you know...

22:34.163 --> 22:35.064
You are! You're like...

22:35.097 --> 22:37.033
I think you've...
You're a bright mind.

22:37.066 --> 22:38.334
You always have
intelligent ideas.

22:38.367 --> 22:40.069
You always have
an interesting

22:40.102 --> 22:41.636
perspective on things,
you know.

22:41.669 --> 22:43.671
Yeah, but it's not,
you know, um,

22:44.740 --> 22:46.075
alien fighting, sexy, like...

22:46.108 --> 22:47.710
Right, yeah.
It's not... It's not...

22:47.743 --> 22:49.611
- It's not a futuristic film.
- No.

22:49.644 --> 22:51.113
Yeah, but that...
Does it have to be?

22:51.147 --> 22:52.181
Does it have to be
to be interesting?

22:52.214 --> 22:53.983
No, but it has to be as...
No, it doesn't have to be.

22:54.016 --> 22:55.051
But it just
has to be something

22:55.084 --> 22:58.087
that people are not gonna
forget as soon as they...

22:58.120 --> 23:00.056
You know,
as soon as the credits roll.

23:00.089 --> 23:01.724
Right, but I just think,

23:01.757 --> 23:04.026
you know,
that's going the outside in.

23:04.060 --> 23:05.861
I think focus on
what you wanna do.

23:05.895 --> 23:07.263
What you wanna
make for yourself.

23:07.296 --> 23:09.732
And if you're happy with it,
you know...

23:09.765 --> 23:11.267
Yeah, but... Yeah,
but you know what I'm saying.

23:11.300 --> 23:12.802
If you're happy with it

23:12.835 --> 23:13.936
and you've put
your heart into it,

23:13.969 --> 23:15.704
then it will work out.
But if you're thinking about,

23:15.738 --> 23:17.672
"Oh, well,
I hope it's impressive

23:17.706 --> 23:18.707
"and I hope, you know,

23:18.741 --> 23:21.877
"it will be as good as
Garance's film, and it's..."

23:21.911 --> 23:22.845
You don't need that,
you don't need that.

23:22.878 --> 23:24.914
You just think about
what makes you happy,

23:24.947 --> 23:27.049
what works for you,
what you're interested in.

23:27.083 --> 23:28.250
And it will translate,
I think.

23:52.374 --> 23:54.844
Oh.

23:54.877 --> 23:56.278
To your right, darling.

23:57.813 --> 23:58.981
Ooh!

23:59.014 --> 24:00.382
Who are you?

24:00.416 --> 24:01.584
Julie.

24:05.454 --> 24:06.822
Have a seat.

24:17.333 --> 24:20.202
I was, uh,
Anthony Reeves' girlfriend.

24:26.408 --> 24:28.744
Wait a minute.
I'm gonna check something.

24:50.366 --> 24:52.301
Your skin is very soft.

24:55.070 --> 24:56.238
You're pretty.

24:58.240 --> 25:02.344
Anthony has really good taste.

25:02.378 --> 25:04.747
I mean,
he used to have good taste.

25:08.951 --> 25:11.353
He gave me this.
His present.

25:12.855 --> 25:15.824
But sometimes it doesn't work.

25:15.858 --> 25:19.261
Sometimes I have to ask
Stephen for help.

25:19.295 --> 25:21.163
Can I have your lighter,
please?

25:30.406 --> 25:31.407
No.

25:35.411 --> 25:36.445
Did he come here

25:37.246 --> 25:38.414
before he died?

25:40.115 --> 25:41.283
I mean, the day.

25:42.184 --> 25:43.252
Why?

25:44.386 --> 25:46.288
I just didn't know
what he did in that time.

25:46.322 --> 25:48.023
Because I left and...

25:49.458 --> 25:53.062
He was by himself
for an afternoon,

25:53.095 --> 25:56.065
and I didn't know
what he did, so...

25:56.098 --> 26:00.069
I'm very cut up about
what happened to Anthony.

26:01.570 --> 26:04.106
Almost destroyed me.

26:09.345 --> 26:11.213
He was very special.

26:12.481 --> 26:14.016
I know how you feel.

27:38.400 --> 27:44.306
<i>♪ I've often thought about</i>

27:46.075 --> 27:48.877
<i>♪ The men where I came from</i>

27:50.112 --> 27:52.848
<i>♪ And times ago</i>

27:54.149 --> 28:00.589

28:02.124 --> 28:04.927
<i>♪ In US and</i>

28:04.960 --> 28:09.665

28:09.699 --> 28:12.267
- Excellent, Lee. Thank you.
- No problem.

28:16.405 --> 28:18.073
I'll go and find the sign.
Change that.

28:18.107 --> 28:20.876
Just that one to do
and we're there. Mmm.

28:26.315 --> 28:29.218
This is, uh,
going to be probably

28:29.251 --> 28:32.054
the most important thing
you do at film school.

28:32.087 --> 28:33.355
This is your graduation film.

28:34.256 --> 28:36.592
And of course you came with

28:36.625 --> 28:38.427
a great deal of
powerful images

28:38.460 --> 28:40.562
and images of Sunderland,

28:40.596 --> 28:43.098
that idea for a story
in Sunderland.

28:43.132 --> 28:44.967
And there was
an engagement with...

28:45.000 --> 28:46.168
With life, with...

28:46.703 --> 28:48.370
With people's lives.

28:48.404 --> 28:52.007
And although it was unformed,
it was early as a filmmaker

28:52.040 --> 28:53.008
and although we could sense

28:53.041 --> 28:55.444
that there were other things
in you at that time

28:55.477 --> 28:58.280
that needed to develop,

28:58.313 --> 29:03.385
uh, I can't connect it
with this script

29:03.419 --> 29:05.120
that I have
in front of me now.

29:05.154 --> 29:06.723
These images...

29:06.756 --> 29:10.959
These characters
don't seem to relate to you.

29:10.993 --> 29:13.095
I mean, what...
What has changed?

29:13.128 --> 29:15.164
Where... What is going on?

29:15.197 --> 29:18.267
What has happened
to produce this new...

29:18.300 --> 29:20.335
Where's, where has
that other world gone,

29:20.369 --> 29:22.471
that Sunderland world?

29:22.504 --> 29:25.607
I don't wanna show life
as it plays out in real time.

29:25.641 --> 29:28.143
I wanna show life
as I imagine it.

29:28.177 --> 29:30.979
That's what
cinema's all about.

29:31.013 --> 29:32.181
So what are you telling
the audience

29:32.214 --> 29:33.449
with these images?

29:33.482 --> 29:37.486
It's about a relationship in a fairy
tale, in a fantasy,

29:37.519 --> 29:40.022
that hopefully,
many people can relate to

29:40.055 --> 29:41.590
in their own way.

29:41.623 --> 29:44.526
We want to encourage
innovation,

29:44.560 --> 29:47.563
young filmmakers
to find their own voices.

29:47.596 --> 29:50.365
But we also want to encourage
professional practice

29:50.399 --> 29:52.735
and I look at this and I don't
see anything that resembles

29:52.769 --> 29:54.704
what I think of
as a professional script.

29:54.737 --> 29:56.171
Can I ask
what you consider

29:56.205 --> 29:57.506
to be a professional script?

29:57.539 --> 29:59.742
Well, I'll leave aside
the red bow,

29:59.776 --> 30:02.044
but at this stage,
a title,

30:02.077 --> 30:04.446
although you then rather
archly have a subtitle,

30:04.480 --> 30:06.148
"Art Is Life."

30:06.181 --> 30:07.316
But there are no
scene headings.

30:07.349 --> 30:10.319
So... So are we now
discussing the layout

30:10.352 --> 30:12.354
of the script
as a reason?

30:12.387 --> 30:14.523
The layout
captures the precision

30:14.556 --> 30:17.459
with which you're thinking
about your project.

30:17.493 --> 30:20.462
It's very unclear how you're
helping your collaborators

30:20.496 --> 30:23.131
find their way through
your proposed set of images.

30:23.165 --> 30:26.401
What it is you're trying to...
To photograph.

30:26.435 --> 30:29.137
And then behind that,
I think our deeper concern

30:29.171 --> 30:32.207
is that there's also a lack of
precision about your thinking.

30:32.241 --> 30:33.308
What your intentions are.

30:33.342 --> 30:35.611
What you're hoping to express
and to explore here.

30:35.644 --> 30:37.246
I'm sorry, Julie, but...

30:40.750 --> 30:44.620
If you pursue this film
as you present it to us now,

30:45.822 --> 30:48.323
I'm afraid
the school cannot support you

30:48.357 --> 30:49.558
and will not support you.

30:49.591 --> 30:52.294
Is it... Presumably, there's
a technician who takes the...

30:52.327 --> 30:54.263
Who actually takes
the film things, is it?

30:54.296 --> 30:56.131
Well, no, not really.
I mean, yeah,

30:56.164 --> 30:58.367
there's store cupboards
and people that look after...

30:58.400 --> 31:00.068
No, no. But I mean the person
behind the camera is a...

31:00.102 --> 31:01.403
Is an expert, are they?

31:01.436 --> 31:03.171
No! Absolutely not,
they're students.

31:03.205 --> 31:04.506
- They're all students.
- They're all students?

31:04.540 --> 31:06.408
Yes. The whole team
is students.

31:07.442 --> 31:09.144
And no one's
giving you direction?

31:09.177 --> 31:10.512
No. Well, me.
I'm the director.

31:10.546 --> 31:12.247
No, no, I don't mean
the director.

31:12.281 --> 31:14.082
But no one's telling you
how to do it?

31:14.116 --> 31:15.183
No.

31:19.488 --> 31:21.590
Sounds fairly typical
for an art school.

31:23.592 --> 31:25.594
Better come and work
on the farm for a bit.

31:26.896 --> 31:28.230
But it's exciting.

31:28.263 --> 31:29.832
I mean,
you're pulling together

31:29.866 --> 31:31.266
and helping each other

31:31.300 --> 31:34.737
on all your own projects,
aren't you?

31:34.771 --> 31:37.339
So you'll help somebody else
with their film and...

31:37.372 --> 31:39.441
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, exciting.

31:39.474 --> 31:41.109
Mmm.

31:41.143 --> 31:43.245
- So is the script done?
- Mm-hmm.

31:44.279 --> 31:45.715
And do we know
what the script's about?

31:45.748 --> 31:47.583
Can we put... I actually
really don't wanna talk

31:47.616 --> 31:48.851
- about it anymore.
- Darling...

31:48.885 --> 31:50.319
We're trying to get it,
but, um...

31:50.352 --> 31:51.653
I know you are.
It's just...

31:51.688 --> 31:53.589
It's very irritating for me having
to explain it a thousand times.

31:53.622 --> 31:55.524
We don't mean
to be irritating.

31:55.557 --> 31:57.125
We're just very excited
and interested.

31:57.159 --> 31:57.994
Don't be irritated.

31:58.027 --> 31:59.628
But anyhow,
we're looking forward to it.

32:06.368 --> 32:08.403
No, thanks.
No, I've given up sugar.

32:08.437 --> 32:09.706
- You've given up sugar?
- Yeah.

32:10.873 --> 32:12.474
Didn't think
that would ever happen.

32:15.812 --> 32:17.680
You've missed the significance
though, of the pot.

32:18.681 --> 32:21.383
That's
Mummy's first artefact.

32:22.484 --> 32:23.518
Do you mean you made it?

32:23.552 --> 32:25.153
I'm very proud of it.

32:25.187 --> 32:26.588
- It's very good.
- You should be.

32:26.622 --> 32:28.624
The top's a bit wonky.
It doesn't really fit, but...

32:28.657 --> 32:30.727
I think it's great.

32:32.294 --> 32:33.763
Early Etruscan handles.

32:34.764 --> 32:36.198
What are...
Are these...

32:36.231 --> 32:37.466
That's so sweet
of you to say that.

32:37.499 --> 32:38.367
Yes, well I thought...

32:38.400 --> 32:39.334
They're a bit in the way,
aren't they?

32:39.368 --> 32:41.536
I'm glad you
noticed, darling.

32:41.570 --> 32:43.472
Well, I haven't learnt
how to do the handles yet.

32:43.505 --> 32:45.173
Okay, well...

32:45.207 --> 32:48.610
It's very rough,
but it is my first effort.

32:49.979 --> 32:52.648
You know,
for a month's work, it's...

32:52.682 --> 32:53.883
- A month?
- ...quite an achieve...

32:53.916 --> 32:55.384
- Well, now, probably...
- No.

32:55.417 --> 32:56.719
How long have you been doing
this course?

32:56.753 --> 32:58.286
Well, I've been doing
the course for a month,

32:58.320 --> 33:00.489
but I mean,
the pot didn't take a month.

33:00.522 --> 33:02.591
But I'm loving it,
I have to say.

33:02.624 --> 33:05.227
I'm loving
going to college and...

33:05.260 --> 33:07.529
And this is the first
of many things.

33:07.562 --> 33:10.933
I'm going to be filling
this house with artefacts.

33:16.571 --> 33:18.173
What was he like
on that Friday?

33:18.808 --> 33:20.409
I want to hear it again.

33:23.012 --> 33:25.882
Well, as I told you,

33:27.717 --> 33:31.253
he seemed particularly happy.

33:36.458 --> 33:37.626
He, um...

33:38.895 --> 33:41.563
You know,
made me a cup of tea

33:41.596 --> 33:45.802
and, um, we had a...

33:45.835 --> 33:48.270
A rather lovely breakfast together.
And, uh...

33:49.604 --> 33:51.239
And off he went.

33:56.311 --> 33:58.715
And what did you think about
him when you first met him?

34:04.921 --> 34:06.789
- When, when he came here?
- Mmm.

34:11.426 --> 34:13.830
Well I... I was disposed to
like him because you did.

34:17.565 --> 34:19.434
Did you just like him
because I did?

34:20.569 --> 34:22.270
No. No, I...

34:23.438 --> 34:24.940
I grew very fond of him.

34:35.350 --> 34:37.018
And what did you feel
when he died?

34:41.056 --> 34:44.326
I was, um,
very concerned for you.

34:46.360 --> 34:47.496
No, not what I felt.

34:47.529 --> 34:48.931
What did...
What did you feel?

34:52.034 --> 34:53.635
When you got
that phone call?

35:04.513 --> 35:06.048
I felt through you.

35:08.650 --> 35:10.887
You're a very good little dog.

35:11.821 --> 35:13.355
Done really well.

35:17.592 --> 35:18.660
Come on.

35:21.964 --> 35:23.032
Come on.

35:41.884 --> 35:43.385
Have you got everything?

35:43.418 --> 35:44.452
Um... Yeah,

35:44.486 --> 35:45.554
- and my bag's upstairs.
- Bag?

35:45.587 --> 35:46.454
I'll get it.

35:46.488 --> 35:48.691
Thank you.
It's on the landing.

35:48.724 --> 35:49.926
Can't you stay
for another night?

35:49.959 --> 35:51.027
- I can't stay.
- Just one more...

35:51.060 --> 35:52.460
Not this time.
Not this time,

35:52.494 --> 35:53.562
but next time, okay?

35:53.595 --> 35:54.629
- Right. Soon?
- So soon, I promise.

35:54.663 --> 35:56.032
For a long time.
For a rest.

35:56.065 --> 35:58.400
- I wanna ask you something.
- Yeah.

35:58.433 --> 36:00.102
I am so sorry, I...

36:00.136 --> 36:01.838
I need some more money.

36:01.871 --> 36:03.706
For this film.
For this graduation film.

36:03.739 --> 36:04.974
- Really?
- Yes.

36:05.007 --> 36:06.042
And I promise,
I'll pay you back.

36:06.075 --> 36:07.109
It's for the film?

36:07.143 --> 36:08.410
- It's for the film.
- Uh-huh.

36:08.443 --> 36:09.644
It's £10,000.

36:09.679 --> 36:11.613
Oh, darling,
that is a lot of money.

36:15.117 --> 36:16.384
Let me take that.

36:16.418 --> 36:18.587
- It's heavy.
- I know.

36:18.620 --> 36:20.823
- Bye-bye, darling.
- Bye-bye.

36:20.857 --> 36:23.960
- Be well.
- You, too.

36:23.993 --> 36:25.094
- Bye, Mummy.
- There you go.

36:25.127 --> 36:27.529
Bye, my darling.

36:27.562 --> 36:29.165
Hope the preparations
for the film go well.

36:29.198 --> 36:31.033
- Drive safely.
- Thank you, Daddy.

36:31.067 --> 36:32.601
See you soon.

36:32.634 --> 36:34.070
You ring us
when you get there.

36:34.103 --> 36:35.370
Always.

36:57.059 --> 36:58.961

you lead me</i>

36:58.995 --> 37:01.563

37:41.103 --> 37:44.173
We have, like, ten...

37:45.308 --> 37:47.642
Before that, you
don't even have a main cast.

37:47.676 --> 37:49.745
I know. This is...
This is so much more important.

37:49.779 --> 37:50.880
I'm so sorry. This is
so much more important.

37:50.913 --> 37:52.248
At least need to have
them both.

37:52.281 --> 37:54.750
I have some ideas that...

37:54.784 --> 37:57.887
I mean, some of them
are very different. Um...

37:57.920 --> 37:59.689
He's too handsome.

37:59.722 --> 38:00.856
- He's too classically...
- Yeah.

38:00.890 --> 38:01.991
- Yeah, yeah. Right.
- It's too...

38:02.024 --> 38:03.159
No, I don't...
I don't really like him.

38:03.192 --> 38:04.526
I don't really like
these two guys.

38:04.559 --> 38:05.761
No, I was gonna say,
these are too...

38:05.795 --> 38:07.129
- Yeah.
- He's nice.

38:07.163 --> 38:08.864
This is not... They're...

38:08.898 --> 38:09.999
They're too...
They're too glamorous.

38:10.032 --> 38:11.267
Are you getting it
as well?

38:11.300 --> 38:12.868
It's also the picture,
but I agree with you.

38:12.902 --> 38:14.103
I know.
They're wearing lots of makeup.

38:14.136 --> 38:15.503
They're too
sophisticated or something.

38:15.537 --> 38:16.872
- Yep.
- I agree, I agree.

38:16.906 --> 38:18.908
So this...
This one I really like.

38:20.042 --> 38:22.712
I don't know, what do
you think? She's like...

38:22.745 --> 38:24.180
There's something fragile,
but still, like, you know,

38:24.213 --> 38:25.715
a bit noble about her
that I really like.

38:25.748 --> 38:27.850
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:27.883 --> 38:30.119
Get this girl cast,
get this guy cast.

38:30.152 --> 38:33.756
Um, but, I mean,
Julie said she's on it.

38:33.789 --> 38:36.058
So... She seems okay.
She seems okay.

38:36.092 --> 38:38.626
I mean, I'm a bit stressed
about it, but trust her.

38:38.660 --> 38:39.962
So, we'll see, yeah? Okay?

38:39.996 --> 38:41.697
Good. Yeah, James,
you all right?

38:41.731 --> 38:43.665
Maybe this one,
but I really don't like him.

38:43.699 --> 38:44.834
No. No. It's...
No.

38:44.867 --> 38:46.102
- Happy you don't like him.
- No.

38:46.135 --> 38:48.037
Uh, he's called Pete.

38:48.070 --> 38:51.841
I saw him, um,
maybe two weeks ago on stage.

38:51.874 --> 38:53.641
- Mmm.
- He's very special.

38:53.675 --> 38:56.312
I think, if I understand well,
the project,

38:56.345 --> 38:57.680
I think he's the one.

38:57.713 --> 39:01.050
He has something
that I cannot even describe.

39:01.083 --> 39:02.918
You really have to meet him.
So if that's okay...

39:02.952 --> 39:04.652
- Mmm. Yeah.
- We can meet him tomorrow?

39:04.687 --> 39:05.888
- Mmm, yeah. I would love that.
- Perfect.

39:05.921 --> 39:07.023
I would love that.
And the girl?

39:07.056 --> 39:08.124
And I'll call her agent
as well

39:08.157 --> 39:09.725
and try and talk
to her tomorrow.

39:09.759 --> 39:10.793
Yeah. Perfect! Fantastic.

39:10.826 --> 39:13.062
- Great! Brilliant. Thank you.
- All right, thank you.

39:19.335 --> 39:22.004
Does the budget stretch
to me getting an editor, or...

39:22.038 --> 39:23.671
The budget does not stretch.

39:23.706 --> 39:27.043
The budget stays exactly
the way it is at the moment.

39:27.076 --> 39:29.979
Away from the windows and
just set them a bit back.

39:31.013 --> 39:32.281
Because at least
you could have

39:32.314 --> 39:33.615
some light through it,
or something.

39:33.648 --> 39:35.084
What do you think?

39:35.117 --> 39:36.551
I think let's do that.

39:38.220 --> 39:39.722
Um, Garance,
if you just have a second?

39:39.755 --> 39:40.823
Yeah, sure.

39:40.856 --> 39:43.759
Um... It's just a thought
I had just... Just now.

39:43.793 --> 39:45.995
Um, you don't have to have
an answer immediately.

39:46.028 --> 39:47.096
But I just...

39:47.129 --> 39:51.233
It suddenly occurred to me
if you were interested in...

39:51.267 --> 39:53.069
In playing the girl?

39:53.102 --> 39:54.203
Julie,
do you want a hand?

39:54.236 --> 39:55.670
- No, we're good. We're fine.
- Sure?

39:55.704 --> 39:56.939
Yeah, we're so close.

39:57.706 --> 39:58.774
Mind your toes.

40:00.309 --> 40:01.710
Why's he got your bed?

40:02.912 --> 40:04.180
For the set.

40:04.213 --> 40:06.148
- Oh, for your film?
- Yeah, that's what I said.

40:06.182 --> 40:09.685
Oh! Right.

40:09.718 --> 40:11.153
So is it going
to your school?

40:11.187 --> 40:12.822
- Yeah.
- Wow.

40:12.855 --> 40:15.091
- Yeah.
- When is that?

40:15.124 --> 40:17.026
Like, next week we start.

40:17.059 --> 40:18.260
- Next week?
- Yeah.

40:19.762 --> 40:20.996
- Yeah.
- Oh.

40:22.965 --> 40:25.935
Okay. I didn't realize
it was that soon.

40:26.836 --> 40:28.003
Next week.

40:30.239 --> 40:32.241
So everything's set with it?

40:32.274 --> 40:33.809
Yeah, more or less.

40:37.079 --> 40:38.613
Like, casting's set?

40:39.782 --> 40:42.718
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah...

40:42.751 --> 40:44.286
I was...
I wanted to talk to you

40:44.320 --> 40:45.855
about it actually,
'cause I...

40:47.289 --> 40:49.191
'Cause you know
I've been going for castings

40:49.225 --> 40:51.760
- and it's not been going well.
- Yeah.

40:52.928 --> 40:55.164
Well, not like, badly,
but not...

40:55.197 --> 40:57.299
I'm not getting parts
for things.

41:01.003 --> 41:03.172
So you're...
You're saying you've cast it?

41:04.974 --> 41:07.910
Yeah, I have two people
that are...

41:07.943 --> 41:09.945
They're really, you know...
They're quite right for it.

41:09.979 --> 41:12.448
But I...
It's got nothing to do with you.

41:12.481 --> 41:14.083
That's the thing...
It's got nothing to do...

41:14.116 --> 41:15.718
So you've not...
So I'm not in it at all?

41:16.218 --> 41:17.286
Not this one.

41:18.187 --> 41:20.890
- And it was such a...
- Okay.

41:20.923 --> 41:22.324
I just, I honestly...

41:24.326 --> 41:26.395
It... It's got literally...
It's got nothing to do with...

41:26.428 --> 41:28.097
You're such
a fantastic actress.

41:28.130 --> 41:29.265
It's nothing to do

41:29.298 --> 41:30.900
- with your abilities, or...
- Mm-hmm.

41:32.201 --> 41:33.369
It's just...

41:35.271 --> 41:38.274
You know, the girl
who I have in mind,

41:38.307 --> 41:39.408
she...
She's not an actress.

41:39.441 --> 41:40.476
You know,
she's a filmmaker and...

41:40.509 --> 41:42.711
- She's not an actress?
- No.

41:42.745 --> 41:43.879
But she's a filmmaker
and that...

41:43.913 --> 41:45.814
I kind of wanted that,

41:45.848 --> 41:49.385
so she can bring a little bit
of her own experience to it.

41:49.418 --> 41:51.353
Mm-hmm.

41:51.387 --> 41:53.389
- Okay. Well...
- But it's got...

41:53.422 --> 41:54.990
It's got nothing to do
with you. And I didn't...

41:55.024 --> 41:56.058
Well, it does.

41:56.091 --> 41:57.927
If you're not casting me
in something, then it's me.

41:57.960 --> 42:00.362
You don't... I'm not...
I'm not gonna take it personally,

42:00.396 --> 42:02.164
but don't say it's got
nothing to do with you,

42:02.198 --> 42:03.432
'cause obviously,
casting's completely

42:03.465 --> 42:04.833
- to do with the person.
- Okay. Okay, well...

42:12.174 --> 42:13.442
<i>Where's the wall?</i>

42:13.475 --> 42:15.344
<i>The wall was,
it is no more.</i>

42:56.986 --> 42:58.220
<i>A girl fought
against me.</i>

42:58.254 --> 42:59.421
<i>Little swallow.</i>

43:31.287 --> 43:33.088
Hello.

43:33.122 --> 43:34.123
- Hi, Pete.
- Hey, guys.

43:34.156 --> 43:35.391
Looking good,
mate, looking good.

43:35.424 --> 43:36.458
- Hello.
- Hi.

43:36.492 --> 43:37.860
- You look great!
- Thank you.

43:37.893 --> 43:39.495
- Looks great.
- I feel comfortable.

43:39.528 --> 43:40.963
- Yeah?
- Mmm.

43:40.996 --> 43:42.931
Can we introduce you
to the DP, Ben?

43:42.965 --> 43:44.433
- Of course.
- Ben, this is Pete.

43:44.466 --> 43:45.901
- Hey, man.
- Pleasure to meet you, mate.

43:45.934 --> 43:47.102
- How's it going?
- Lovely to meet you.

43:47.136 --> 43:48.304
- There.
- There?

43:48.337 --> 43:49.905
- A little bit up, please.
- Up?

43:49.938 --> 43:51.573
Perfect, no,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

43:51.607 --> 43:53.208
But don't worry
about being too steady,

43:53.242 --> 43:56.345
but also, you know,
not too documentary. So...

43:56.378 --> 43:57.880
But don't worry about...
Okay.

43:57.913 --> 44:00.049
The onboard music
is so awkward to me for...

44:00.082 --> 44:02.584
If we hear...
If we hear a little...

44:02.618 --> 44:04.420
- Oh, those are the shoes?
- Yeah.

44:04.453 --> 44:05.854
Okay, cool.

44:07.022 --> 44:09.591
Oh, love the color, though.
Like the color.

44:12.027 --> 44:14.463
Trying to figure out.

44:20.235 --> 44:21.570
We can do
something to that.

44:23.972 --> 44:25.174
It's a weird rhythm
anyway.

44:25.207 --> 44:27.276
So we can do
whatever we want, right?

44:27.309 --> 44:28.610
<i>So we're gonna,
are we gonna...</i>

44:28.644 --> 44:32.181
I feel like my energy
was too high,

44:32.214 --> 44:34.983
or too lively.
I don't know how to say that.

44:35.017 --> 44:36.051
Do you know what I mean?

44:36.085 --> 44:37.586
I... I thought
it was quite lively.

44:39.488 --> 44:41.357
I was really happy.
So it's...

44:41.390 --> 44:43.225
It is quite accurate.
It's really good.

44:43.258 --> 44:45.894
But you're much more...

44:45.928 --> 44:47.162
No, you're perfect.
You're perfect.

44:47.196 --> 44:48.130
You have nothing
to worry about.

44:48.163 --> 44:50.132
Are we all set up now?
Are we ready for a shot?

44:50.165 --> 44:51.967
Yes, we're ready.
Ready when you are.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.903
Because I... I'm just looking
at this and I actually think

44:54.937 --> 44:58.374
it's the wrong angle for what we're...
For what I want.

44:58.407 --> 45:01.543
That I...
I actually, um...

45:01.577 --> 45:04.513
I... I think we should have it
on the other side of the door,

45:04.546 --> 45:06.014
because it feels
wrong to me

45:06.048 --> 45:08.617
that we should have
this camera

45:08.650 --> 45:10.986
seeing more
than she does.

45:11.019 --> 45:13.322
Because I don't want to see
exactly what's going on

45:13.355 --> 45:14.990
inside this bathroom
because she doesn't.

45:15.023 --> 45:16.091
And I know that's just...

45:16.125 --> 45:17.259
I know that's
a last minute thing.

45:17.292 --> 45:18.560
- I know it's really, really...
- Julie, we're all set up.

45:18.594 --> 45:19.661
I know. I know.
I know we are!

45:19.696 --> 45:21.029
We're all set up for this scene.
I think we should...

45:21.063 --> 45:21.997
You want
the camera here?

45:22.030 --> 45:25.200
- You want the camera here?
- Here. Yep.

45:25.234 --> 45:28.070
With the door shut.
Do we see in the bathroom?

45:28.103 --> 45:30.305
Um...
Maybe here.

45:31.440 --> 45:32.474
Here, because
she has to come...

45:32.508 --> 45:34.176
- She has to come past.
- Okay.

45:34.209 --> 45:36.412
Um, we don't wanna see
inside the bathroom.

45:36.445 --> 45:37.680
Maybe when you...

45:37.714 --> 45:39.915
Actually, no, sorry, sorry.
Here.

45:45.654 --> 45:47.523
- He's very good at hiding it.
- For a year.

45:47.556 --> 45:49.658
But also you...
Yeah, for a year.

45:49.692 --> 45:51.960
For a year,
but also you have suspicion.

45:51.994 --> 45:53.362
You also don't really
want to believe this.

45:53.395 --> 45:54.596
This is an easier thing,
you know...

45:54.630 --> 45:55.998
It's not an easy thing
to believe

45:56.031 --> 45:57.266
about someone you love.

45:57.299 --> 45:58.567
- You know?
- No, I don't.

45:58.600 --> 46:00.202
- Do you understand that?
- I don't.

46:01.236 --> 46:04.139
- Well, it's, you know...
- Well, it's...

46:04.173 --> 46:08.110
You're saying you don't want
to believe it, I guess, but...

46:08.143 --> 46:09.746
- Yeah. I can understand that.
- But this is the furthest...

46:09.779 --> 46:12.648
This is just one of the
times we are seeing...

46:14.249 --> 46:17.219
You have a feeling as though
when you were dancing together

46:17.252 --> 46:18.721
and during that whole time,
during that whole day,

46:18.755 --> 46:20.422
during dinner,
doing whatever you were doing

46:20.456 --> 46:22.692
before you started dancing,
before we saw you,

46:22.725 --> 46:24.460
that is going on
in the back of his head,

46:24.493 --> 46:26.562
he is wondering
when is the next time

46:26.595 --> 46:29.031
he's going to go off
by himself

46:29.064 --> 46:30.232
and do whatever he does,

46:30.265 --> 46:32.601
that you don't really
properly know what goes on.

46:34.203 --> 46:36.638
Because I give him space
and I respect him.

46:36.672 --> 46:38.640
So I...
There's this sense of...

46:38.674 --> 46:40.642
You do, but also,
he doesn't...

46:40.676 --> 46:42.478
He doesn't really allow
anything else.

46:42.511 --> 46:43.713
- Fine.
- So that's...

46:43.746 --> 46:45.080
You are doing
as much as you can.

46:45.113 --> 46:46.415
You can say that
in this relationship,

46:46.448 --> 46:48.250
he has...
He has the power.

46:48.283 --> 46:49.451
Yeah. 100%.

46:49.485 --> 46:51.053
There may be
some knocking.

46:51.086 --> 46:52.488
Yeah, well, find that...
I'll find that out.

46:52.521 --> 46:55.090
Yeah, there may be
some knocking. Um...

46:55.123 --> 46:56.325
That looks good
by the way, Ben.

46:56.358 --> 46:57.426
Yeah?

46:57.459 --> 46:58.660
That looks nice
in the monitor.

46:58.695 --> 47:00.062
Yeah? Okay.

47:01.563 --> 47:03.499
Well, I mean,
there's a lot...

47:03.532 --> 47:04.600
There's a lot of wall.

47:07.069 --> 47:09.204
Well, I don't know if I,
what I can put up there, man.

47:11.206 --> 47:13.175
Let's see if I have
something in the bedroom.

47:13.208 --> 47:14.510
Where should
this scene go?

47:14.543 --> 47:16.578
Because if we start
with that like,

47:16.612 --> 47:18.347
"Oh, my God, yeah,
he's actually doing heroin."

47:18.380 --> 47:20.415
Then we have to
maybe sit in...

47:20.449 --> 47:22.184
In the bathroom
and start talking and maybe...

47:22.217 --> 47:24.119
No. You wouldn't
talk about it.

47:24.152 --> 47:26.321
Honestly, I don't think you'd
talk about it straight away.

47:26.355 --> 47:27.623
- You don't want any dialogue?
- Can we get cast...

47:27.656 --> 47:29.692
No. Honestly,
it's not about that.

47:31.460 --> 47:32.729
Julie,
can we get cast in there

47:32.762 --> 47:34.663
- to start taking positions?
- Yeah.

47:34.697 --> 47:35.798
- Yeah.
- It's honestly... It's just...

47:35.832 --> 47:39.334
You cannot just see
that and not talk about it.

47:39.368 --> 47:40.435
Well,
that's how I did it.

47:40.469 --> 47:41.804
That's how it happened.

47:44.106 --> 47:46.074
So don't say it.
You didn't say anything.

47:48.510 --> 47:50.579
- Okay.
- Can we just see positions?

48:00.589 --> 48:02.759
Alfie, please!
Please.

48:09.665 --> 48:12.634
Please open the...

48:13.635 --> 48:15.337
I just want to see you.

48:26.883 --> 48:28.283
And cut.

48:28.317 --> 48:29.318
Cut there!

48:32.287 --> 48:33.121
Cut there.

48:33.155 --> 48:35.792
You're... You're...
You're angry.

48:35.825 --> 48:37.760
You're...
You're irritated by him.

48:37.794 --> 48:40.897
He was like a child
rushing off.

48:40.930 --> 48:42.699
You know, you're
in an adult relationship

48:42.732 --> 48:43.665
and he's running off
and being...

48:43.700 --> 48:45.735
Did you ever see
sadness in there?

48:47.369 --> 48:48.705
Yeah, quite a bit.

48:48.738 --> 48:50.505
"Quite a bit."
So that was...

48:50.539 --> 48:52.641
Maybe that's why he,
you know...

48:52.674 --> 48:55.677
Maybe that's why
he... Um...

48:55.712 --> 48:57.379
Sounds like
he's calling for help.

48:57.412 --> 48:58.614
So I'm just gonna...

49:42.624 --> 49:45.160
It was a terrible lunch.

49:46.328 --> 49:47.897
- It was okay.
- Yeah?

49:48.765 --> 49:49.932
Heavy.

49:49.966 --> 49:51.433
- Heavy?
- Mm-hmm.

49:51.466 --> 49:52.869
Excuse me, um...

49:52.902 --> 49:54.704
Do you know
what we're doing?

49:54.737 --> 49:57.239
Stop asking me that.

49:57.272 --> 49:59.207
What? I feel like
you know more.

50:00.910 --> 50:02.745
Not really, honestly.

50:02.779 --> 50:05.180
The more we... Hi.

50:07.850 --> 50:09.451
So the more...
The more...

50:11.420 --> 50:14.389
...we work on this,
the more I realize

50:14.423 --> 50:16.893
I don't know anything.
Honestly.

50:16.926 --> 50:18.627
I don't understand
the, the...

50:20.395 --> 50:21.229
The relationship.

50:21.263 --> 50:23.398
Yeah, the origin
of the relationship.

50:23.966 --> 50:25.068
You know what I mean?

50:25.101 --> 50:27.704
Yeah, you go to school
with her. You know her well.

50:27.737 --> 50:30.405
No, not really.
She was... She was not...

50:30.439 --> 50:32.008
She was not here
very often.

50:32.041 --> 50:33.642
- What, at school?
- Yeah.

50:35.343 --> 50:37.612
I like her
because she is, uh,

50:39.048 --> 50:41.249
very sensitive
and I think she...

50:41.984 --> 50:44.653
She has a voice,
but she's...

50:45.922 --> 50:48.925
I don't know, too naive,
too fragile or...

50:48.958 --> 50:51.293
And she's not...
I think she's lazy, too.

50:51.326 --> 50:52.661
She's not working enough.

50:52.695 --> 50:54.831
She should, you know...
She should be at school.

50:54.864 --> 50:57.532
She should...
She should be more understanding

50:57.566 --> 50:59.267
that she has to learn
a lot from others.

50:59.301 --> 51:01.603
And again, this is, um...

51:01.636 --> 51:05.007
This is in...
In the real life.

51:05.041 --> 51:07.576
This is three days
before your character died.

51:08.745 --> 51:09.979
Okay.

51:10.012 --> 51:14.516
So this is possibly your last
moment, um, of intimacy...

51:14.549 --> 51:16.518
Well, not int...
Well, yes, intimacy,

51:16.551 --> 51:18.688
but before
it could be intimate.

51:18.721 --> 51:21.523
So you're...
You're feeling...

51:21.556 --> 51:23.993
You're feeling resentment
a little bit,

51:24.026 --> 51:27.764
because you don't know
whether he scored or not.

51:27.797 --> 51:30.565
He's possibly coming down
from something.

51:30.599 --> 51:33.301
And then, I mean,
I look back and I kind of, um...

51:34.804 --> 51:35.872
He's all over the place.

51:35.905 --> 51:38.841
Have awareness
that possibly he was always

51:38.875 --> 51:40.710
either on something,
coming down from something.

51:40.743 --> 51:42.477
Just about to score.
So he just...

51:42.511 --> 51:44.479
So that's also the
reason why I'm objecting here.

51:44.513 --> 51:45.948
Absolutely.
You're not in that mood.

51:45.982 --> 51:46.816
You're not in that space.

51:46.849 --> 51:49.051
And you're both
almost not very present.

51:49.085 --> 51:51.888
How did he feel about
her paying for everything?

51:51.921 --> 51:53.421
What was
that dynamic like?

51:53.455 --> 51:55.323
Because was there not...

51:55.357 --> 51:58.460
Was there not an element
of shame there?

51:58.493 --> 52:00.529
I'm not trying...
I don't want you to think I'm trying to

52:00.562 --> 52:01.596
- justify his actions.
- No.

52:01.630 --> 52:05.367
I'm just trying to justify
his problems, really.

52:05.400 --> 52:06.969
And at the moment,
I don't feel like I know

52:07.003 --> 52:09.972
what they
are, but, um...

52:14.977 --> 52:17.345
So now he's stolen
everything and sold it.

52:17.379 --> 52:18.781
I just feel like
that's a...

52:21.050 --> 52:23.585
A desperate moment for him.

52:30.559 --> 52:32.728
I don't know where to go
with this, you know.

52:32.762 --> 52:34.462
If someone has,
you know...

52:34.496 --> 52:36.598
A friend of mine stole money
from his mum last year,

52:36.631 --> 52:38.667
and everyone around him
thought he was

52:38.701 --> 52:41.003
the worst human being
in the world at the time,

52:41.037 --> 52:43.773
but I knew
that he wasn't well.

52:43.806 --> 52:46.341
I knew that he wasn't
in a place of

52:47.977 --> 52:49.846
normal head space,
I knew that.

52:52.581 --> 52:54.083
Is this quite difficult
for you?

52:54.116 --> 52:55.852
Am I making it
more painful for you?

52:55.885 --> 52:57.687
No. No, no, no.
You're... No, it's not you.

52:57.720 --> 52:58.921
That's the thing,
it's really not.

52:58.955 --> 53:00.422
This is good.

53:00.455 --> 53:01.691
I think it's difficult

53:01.724 --> 53:05.427
because I'm coming up
against your idea of him

53:05.460 --> 53:08.530
rather than a reality of him,
which is understandable.

53:08.865 --> 53:09.932
But...

53:11.466 --> 53:13.468
It makes it
quite difficult for me to

53:15.137 --> 53:16.839
come from a place of truth.

53:18.040 --> 53:20.642
- If that makes sense?
- How are we doing?

53:20.675 --> 53:25.547
So, uh, we need Pedro in
here, ready to dress the set.

53:30.652 --> 53:31.988
So what's the plan?

53:32.021 --> 53:33.588
We're just getting
a very simple shot

53:33.622 --> 53:34.757
of the two of them.

53:34.790 --> 53:37.026
And there's no standing up,
or walking around or anything.

53:37.059 --> 53:38.593
What's...
What's happening?

53:38.627 --> 53:39.695
So they're just
having a conversation...

53:39.729 --> 53:41.097
- Is it evening, Julie?
- Okay.

53:41.130 --> 53:44.066
Um, yes, yeah, sorry.
It is quite late at night.

53:44.100 --> 53:46.135
- Okay, night.
- Uh, night. So you...

53:46.168 --> 53:47.569
It's possibly like,
10:00, 11:00.

53:47.602 --> 53:49.839
- Okay.
- Um, maybe 10:00.

53:49.872 --> 53:50.940
I've been here all day.

53:50.973 --> 53:52.041
You have to close the...

53:52.074 --> 53:53.042
You've been here
all day.

53:53.075 --> 53:56.812
You were here while Garance
was at film school.

53:56.846 --> 53:57.747
Right.

53:57.780 --> 54:01.751
Um... Yeah, so you've
been here all day.

54:01.784 --> 54:02.885
Okay. So...

54:02.919 --> 54:04.186
So they're just having
a conversation

54:04.220 --> 54:06.454
and it's just...
It's quite static.

54:06.488 --> 54:08.791
- You're high.
- I'm probably high.

54:08.824 --> 54:11.127
So I think
maybe just like...

54:11.160 --> 54:13.495
Maybe here?

54:14.764 --> 54:15.831
- Yeah?
- Yeah?

54:16.564 --> 54:17.465
I mean...

54:19.601 --> 54:21.737
I'm sure it wasn't
night originally.

54:21.771 --> 54:24.840
I mean, we're not lit for...
I mean, this isn't night.

54:26.075 --> 54:27.777
Yeah.

54:28.978 --> 54:30.146
What, late night?

54:30.179 --> 54:32.181
Yeah, like,
11:00, 10:00.

54:32.214 --> 54:33.950
- Yeah, please.
- I know, I know. I'm sorry.

54:33.983 --> 54:35.785
- I honestly thought I said it.
- Do we...

54:35.818 --> 54:37.019
Seriously, was that...
Uh...

54:37.053 --> 54:38.721
Yeah, we'll just...
We'll go with that.

54:38.754 --> 54:39.822
If that's
what it's supposed to be,

54:39.855 --> 54:40.890
then we'll work with that.

54:40.923 --> 54:41.991
So we need to start.

54:42.024 --> 54:43.025
Okay.
It's just starting like...

54:43.059 --> 54:44.760
But this is the problem...
This is the problem.

54:44.794 --> 54:46.762
It's the same, like,
you know, with

54:46.796 --> 54:48.064
how many days
we're into...

54:48.097 --> 54:50.166
I've lost all track of time.

54:50.199 --> 54:53.501
Nothing... Nothing changes.

54:53.535 --> 54:54.669
It's the same
every single day.

54:54.704 --> 54:56.906
We... Like, none of us have
any idea what's going on.

54:56.939 --> 54:58.540
It's like,
it's fucking ridiculous.

54:58.573 --> 54:59.507
And I'm getting grief
from Marland about, like...

54:59.541 --> 55:00.475
I feel confident
about what's going on.

55:00.508 --> 55:02.011
- That was one day.
- No, no, no, no.

55:02.044 --> 55:03.179
Marland,
I'm getting grief from you

55:03.212 --> 55:04.747
- about how much stock...
- All right, fine.

55:04.780 --> 55:06.215
...we're going through.
Like, it's...

55:06.248 --> 55:08.017
We've got more now,
so it should be fine.

55:08.050 --> 55:09.051
Um, can we just...

55:09.085 --> 55:09.986
Yeah,
but we cannot continue like this.

55:10.019 --> 55:11.153
- Like, we can't.
- I think, I think...

55:11.187 --> 55:14.824
Like, it's just like, you
know, we're, you know...

55:14.857 --> 55:15.791
All right, we're students,
but we're like...

55:15.825 --> 55:17.093
Okay, there were
a lot of conversations

55:17.126 --> 55:18.194
that happened
during prep that...

55:18.227 --> 55:19.962
Yeah, I know.
I know we're students,

55:19.996 --> 55:21.629
I know we're still learning
and all the rest of it.

55:21.663 --> 55:22.932
But this is our grad film.

55:22.965 --> 55:24.700
- It's really, important stuff.
- Yeah.

55:24.734 --> 55:26.268
And, like, we should be,
like, professional now like...

55:26.302 --> 55:27.502
Okay. So should we start
making a move to

55:27.535 --> 55:29.138
make the changes that we need
to make? Necessary changes.

55:29.171 --> 55:30.740
Well, like, what's...
What's the point?

55:30.773 --> 55:32.108
Because we don't know
what's going on.

55:32.141 --> 55:33.976
Am I antagonizing,
or am I defending?

55:34.010 --> 55:36.045
No, you... No.
And I'm not... But...

55:36.078 --> 55:38.613
Am I antagonizing?
'Cause I don't think I am.

55:38.646 --> 55:40.750
Look, we're dealing
with a serious ego back there

55:40.783 --> 55:42.018
and I don't know
what his problem is.

55:42.051 --> 55:44.652
But he's making it impossible.
He's been impossible all day.

55:44.687 --> 55:46.922
Let's just drop it.
Let's just drop it.

55:46.956 --> 55:48.590
It's all just
broken down. Like...

55:48.623 --> 55:50.658
We just don't know
what's going on.

55:50.693 --> 55:52.328
It's that...
It's that more than anything.

55:52.361 --> 55:55.197
Okay, can you be specific

55:55.231 --> 55:57.900
about what it is that you need from us?
Specifically.

55:57.933 --> 55:59.101
Because you're talking about

55:59.135 --> 56:00.236
you needing everything
to be clear.

56:00.269 --> 56:01.337
Specifically, well, having
a shot list would be nice.

56:01.370 --> 56:03.605
Like, having like, following
the script would be nice.

56:03.638 --> 56:06.242
You know, having some kind
of sense every single day.

56:06.275 --> 56:07.810
Like, instead of
having, like,

56:07.843 --> 56:09.644
the lights changing,
like, halfway through

56:09.677 --> 56:11.579
because suddenly it's day
and then it was night

56:11.613 --> 56:12.580
and then it's day
and then it's night

56:12.614 --> 56:13.581
and then it's day
and then it's night again.

56:13.615 --> 56:14.483
- All right, Ben.
- Like, it's just, like...

56:14.517 --> 56:16.252
So okay.
So thank you for that.

56:16.285 --> 56:17.520
So we're gonna work
on that, okay?

56:17.552 --> 56:19.955
Yeah, but we've had this
conversation so many times!

56:19.989 --> 56:21.724
So what do you wanna do?
Do you wanna walk away?

56:21.757 --> 56:23.259
- I want somebody to...
- What d'you wanna do?

56:23.292 --> 56:25.627
I'm that close.
I'm that close to walking away.

56:25.660 --> 56:27.997
- All right. Do it. Do it then.
- Okay.

56:28.030 --> 56:29.265
Don't say that, Marland.

56:29.298 --> 56:31.599
Guys, calm down now.

56:31.633 --> 56:32.600
No, but he's not gonna do it,
he's all mouth.

56:32.634 --> 56:34.870
You have to also learn
how to take critiques

56:34.904 --> 56:37.940
and have to find a way to
make things work for everyone.

56:37.973 --> 56:40.176
You're like a captain on a boat.
That's what you are.

56:40.209 --> 56:41.911
We've worked
together before

56:41.944 --> 56:44.914
and, like, that's why
we wanna work with Julie,

56:44.947 --> 56:46.182
because of the way
that she works.

56:46.215 --> 56:47.649
But this time it just feels

56:47.683 --> 56:49.118
like we don't know
what's going on.

56:49.151 --> 56:51.087
It's, like, you know,
and we've talked about this

56:51.120 --> 56:53.022
and it just feels, like,
we need to say this now,

56:53.055 --> 56:54.356
because we're all
getting tired...

56:54.390 --> 56:55.925
Okay, I think
that we have said it.

56:55.958 --> 56:57.226
I think that we have.
I am...

56:57.259 --> 56:58.260
No, but you're not
listening to me.

56:58.294 --> 57:00.396
I don't know how to
explain it in like a...

57:00.429 --> 57:01.697
Do you want me to be soft

57:01.730 --> 57:02.932
and gentle
and all the rest of it?

57:02.965 --> 57:05.734
Like, I'm saying it like this
because nobody's listening!

57:05.768 --> 57:07.369
I am so tired
and we are.

57:07.403 --> 57:08.670
We're all tired.

57:08.704 --> 57:09.972
We have to find
another way.

57:10.005 --> 57:11.807
We have to find a system,
something.

57:11.841 --> 57:13.209
- This is too much.
- Yeah, yeah, we are.

57:13.242 --> 57:14.710
We're gonna sort this out.
Yeah.

57:14.743 --> 57:15.811
You're absolutely right.

57:15.845 --> 57:16.812
Things have been
too much. Yeah.

57:16.846 --> 57:18.347
Do you understand
that, Julie, yeah?

58:49.805 --> 58:51.207
Where's my sunny girl?

58:53.475 --> 58:54.743
Hmm?

59:03.919 --> 59:05.421
Could you put that up
for me, darling?

59:05.454 --> 59:08.357
I don't want them
to get the wrong idea.

59:09.825 --> 59:11.227
No, you've had enough.

59:13.796 --> 59:15.397
- Shit!
- Oh.

59:15.431 --> 59:17.299
- I'm so sorry!
- Oh.

59:19.868 --> 59:22.137
I'm so sorry.
Oh, shit.

59:22.905 --> 59:24.073
What's happened?

59:26.542 --> 59:29.111
- Is that the Etruscan pot?
- Oh, what a shame.

59:29.144 --> 59:30.212
- Vandalized.
- I'm so sorry.

59:30.246 --> 59:31.981
I'm so sorry, Mummy.

59:32.014 --> 59:33.882
I really, really,
really didn't...

59:35.551 --> 59:37.419
I shouldn't worry,
it's only a term's fees.

59:37.453 --> 59:38.921
Darling, you didn't do it
on purpose.

59:38.954 --> 59:40.055
I'm sorry.
And I really wouldn't. I'm sorry.

59:40.089 --> 59:41.223
No, it's just
one of those things.

59:41.257 --> 59:43.058
I'm sorry.

59:43.092 --> 59:44.360
Yes, can you get
them out, darling?

59:44.393 --> 59:45.794
- There's some sharp bits.
- I think we can.

59:45.828 --> 59:46.829
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

59:46.862 --> 59:48.097
- Quite sharp bits.
- I'm so sorry.

59:48.130 --> 59:50.833
Ooh, yes. Can you get the dogs
out, darling? I don't want them

59:50.866 --> 59:52.134
- to hurt their feet.
- Come on. Here.

59:52.167 --> 59:54.003
No, it's all right,
it's all right.

59:54.036 --> 59:55.904
Come on.

01:00:05.914 --> 01:00:06.750
Oh, dear.

01:00:06.782 --> 01:00:08.317
Just one of those things,
isn't it?

01:00:10.252 --> 01:00:11.287
Have you cut yourself?

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:12.554
No, just a little bit.

01:00:12.588 --> 01:00:14.390
I'm so sorry.

01:00:14.423 --> 01:00:15.324
I'm so sorry,
is your finger all right?

01:00:15.357 --> 01:00:16.825
Mmm.
I'm gonna go and get a...

01:00:16.859 --> 01:00:18.193
Worse things
happen at sea.

01:00:18.227 --> 01:00:21.130
...a, um, dustpan
and brush.

01:00:21.163 --> 01:00:23.032
And put the kettle on
and start again.

01:00:28.270 --> 01:00:30.472
I shouldn't worry.
She can make another one.

01:00:44.553 --> 01:00:46.955
No, you stay
out of here, please?

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:52.227
Did you...

01:00:52.261 --> 01:00:55.130
No, no, no, no.
Absolutely.

01:00:55.164 --> 01:00:57.032
Good.

01:01:00.469 --> 01:01:02.071
Anybody else
want some more cake?

01:01:03.172 --> 01:01:04.239
Mmm, no, thank you.

01:01:04.273 --> 01:01:05.240
I came across

01:01:05.274 --> 01:01:06.975
the ravaged remnants
of that in the kitchen.

01:01:07.009 --> 01:01:08.977
Well, we're making
fast work of that cake.

01:01:09.011 --> 01:01:10.446
I know. It seems to be
going down quite...

01:01:10.479 --> 01:01:11.947
Quite good, actually,
it's from the shop.

01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:13.215
- Did you make it?
- No, I... It's fine.

01:01:13.248 --> 01:01:15.084
It's Mrs. Daley's best,
is it?

01:01:15.117 --> 01:01:17.086
I'm so sorry.

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:19.021
I'm so sorry.

01:01:34.436 --> 01:01:36.338

01:01:36.372 --> 01:01:38.674

I tried this this morning
and, um...

01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:43.105
Yes, I see that.

01:02:43.138 --> 01:02:44.106
It's much better.

01:02:44.139 --> 01:02:47.576
I liked you as a robot cowboy
in <i>Westworld.</i>

01:02:47.609 --> 01:02:49.344
Less so
as a cutter of films.

01:02:51.213 --> 01:02:52.548
But you liked it.

01:02:52.581 --> 01:02:53.615
- I liked it.
- What did you think?

01:02:53.649 --> 01:02:55.584
What were your thoughts?

01:02:55.617 --> 01:02:58.587
It excites me. I like...
I like what I'm seeing.

01:02:58.620 --> 01:02:59.555
Right.

01:02:59.588 --> 01:03:01.623
I wish it was my film.
You know...

01:03:01.657 --> 01:03:03.459
Right.
That's marvelously generic.

01:03:03.492 --> 01:03:04.526
I mean, if...

01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:07.129
I think we could
do with a few more

01:03:07.162 --> 01:03:08.731
details of the faces.

01:03:08.765 --> 01:03:11.233
Maybe to see some of
the faces as a bit of...

01:03:11.266 --> 01:03:12.501
I've asked for two more days.

01:03:12.534 --> 01:03:14.002
Lydia, can we have
two more days

01:03:14.036 --> 01:03:16.071
- to shoot some close-ups?
- No.

01:03:16.104 --> 01:03:17.473
Then we can't
cut them in, Chris.

01:03:17.506 --> 01:03:19.274
Okay. Yeah.

01:03:19.308 --> 01:03:21.577
We can't cut in those
close-ups we don't have.

01:03:23.545 --> 01:03:25.280
No.

01:03:25.314 --> 01:03:27.616
What do you think?
What does it make you feel?

01:03:27.649 --> 01:03:29.384
Okay. Yeah.

01:03:29.418 --> 01:03:32.054
You're forcing me
to have a tantrum.

01:03:33.622 --> 01:03:36.158
It excites me.
It excites me...

01:03:36.191 --> 01:03:37.292
You said that last time.

01:03:37.326 --> 01:03:39.194
That's
a great thing to say.

01:03:40.162 --> 01:03:43.499
Yeah. Once is enough, though.

01:03:43.532 --> 01:03:45.100
That's all it needs
to be, in a way.

01:03:45.133 --> 01:03:46.668
We should put cutouts.

01:03:46.703 --> 01:03:48.237
This is what we should do.

01:03:49.137 --> 01:03:50.672
Little cutouts
of the audience

01:03:50.707 --> 01:03:52.074
in front of the monitor.

01:03:52.107 --> 01:03:53.308
It's what Scorsese does.

01:03:53.342 --> 01:03:54.376
Okay.

01:03:54.409 --> 01:03:56.211
To remind him
that it's cinema...

01:03:56.245 --> 01:03:57.780
- Cinema. Yeah.
- ...and not something

01:03:57.814 --> 01:03:59.314
- you watch midweek...
- Okay.

01:03:59.348 --> 01:04:00.549
...with your uncle.

01:04:00.582 --> 01:04:02.117
- I think it's great.
- Mmm.

01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:04.219
- It looks great.
- Oh, fuck off!

01:04:04.253 --> 01:04:05.822
It's got energy.
It really has.

01:04:05.855 --> 01:04:07.222
Say what you think.

01:04:07.256 --> 01:04:08.323
Don't say something
that you could say

01:04:08.357 --> 01:04:09.424
after watching anything.

01:04:09.458 --> 01:04:12.094
- "It's great, it excites me."
- Yeah.

01:04:12.127 --> 01:04:14.129
Say something specific,

01:04:14.162 --> 01:04:16.064
so that we can decide what
the next scene

01:04:16.098 --> 01:04:17.533
- should make you feel.
- Okay.

01:04:17.566 --> 01:04:19.702
So that we can take
an emotional line

01:04:19.736 --> 01:04:21.771
through something.

01:04:21.804 --> 01:04:23.539
I think
it starts really well,

01:04:23.572 --> 01:04:25.742
but it's a little flat
in the middle, emotionally.

01:04:25.775 --> 01:04:27.342
Am I...

01:04:27.376 --> 01:04:30.279
What does it make you feel?

01:04:33.649 --> 01:04:35.484
Oh, fuck all of you.

01:04:35.517 --> 01:04:36.585
Honestly.

01:04:37.519 --> 01:04:39.121
Fucking hell!

01:04:42.190 --> 01:04:43.525
Sorry about that.

01:04:43.559 --> 01:04:45.695
I loved it.
I really liked it, so...

01:04:45.728 --> 01:04:48.163
I think it's great.
He's got it all out of perspective.

01:04:48.196 --> 01:04:50.700
- He's stressed.
- Oh... Yeah.

01:04:50.733 --> 01:04:53.268
And... Drunk maybe.

01:04:56.238 --> 01:04:58.340
Let's take another look.
I'll just do this.

01:05:44.586 --> 01:05:46.588
I don't know
if I got enough

01:05:48.958 --> 01:05:51.326
of Garance by herself.

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:54.429
I... I wish
I'd had some solo...

01:05:54.463 --> 01:05:56.531
- In this? Mmm.
- Yeah. I would.

01:05:56.565 --> 01:06:00.569
'Cause it's just,
I think it's too much of the two of them.

01:06:00.602 --> 01:06:02.671
I wish I'd had a moment
just her.

01:06:02.705 --> 01:06:04.606
Well, you've got this moment.

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:05.808
Well, it's not...

01:06:06.575 --> 01:06:08.210
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:06:08.243 --> 01:06:09.746
I think it's a nice shot.
I think it will...

01:06:09.779 --> 01:06:11.480
- We can figure it out.
- Mmm.

01:06:17.687 --> 01:06:19.822
<i>Please?</i>

01:06:19.856 --> 01:06:21.724
You can really tell
that they had chemistry.

01:06:23.225 --> 01:06:25.460
Uh, Pete and Garance.

01:06:25.494 --> 01:06:27.697
- Mm-hmm.
- They really did. Kind of...

01:06:27.730 --> 01:06:28.965
You can really see it
in her eyes, though.

01:06:28.998 --> 01:06:30.499
I think it's quite fitting.

01:06:30.532 --> 01:06:32.567
They work well together?
They...

01:06:32.601 --> 01:06:34.336
Yeah, very, very well,
I think.

01:06:34.369 --> 01:06:36.371
Um, yeah,
they really liked each other.

01:06:36.405 --> 01:06:38.340
It was kind of,
I think it's quite...

01:06:39.608 --> 01:06:41.576
It was, I think it was quite
good for the characters.

01:06:41.610 --> 01:06:43.412
- Mm-hmm.
- Although very different

01:06:43.445 --> 01:06:45.480
eye between the two of
them, you know.

01:06:45.514 --> 01:06:46.783
Well, we can
move things around

01:06:46.816 --> 01:06:49.284
- and we can find it and...
- Yeah.

01:06:49.317 --> 01:06:51.219
I think
it's probably perfectly normal

01:06:51.253 --> 01:06:53.288
to come to editing
in the first place

01:06:53.321 --> 01:06:54.724
and watch the rushes
for the first time

01:06:54.757 --> 01:06:58.427
and feel ambivalent
and it must be so strange

01:06:58.460 --> 01:07:00.262
having an idea
of something and then...

01:07:00.295 --> 01:07:01.731
And then seeing it
for the first time.

01:07:01.764 --> 01:07:03.733
Those kind of questions
are completely normal,

01:07:03.766 --> 01:07:06.769
but I think, as we continue
to watch it

01:07:06.803 --> 01:07:09.271
and piece it together and, uh,

01:07:09.304 --> 01:07:10.707
kind of play
with the moments of it,

01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:12.541
- we'll find it.
- Mmm. Okay.

01:07:12.574 --> 01:07:14.010
Good. Thank you.

01:07:14.043 --> 01:07:15.878
I needed to hear that.

01:07:15.912 --> 01:07:17.446
No, it'll be fine.
It'll be great.

01:07:17.479 --> 01:07:19.347
It's funny. Good. Yeah.

01:07:20.817 --> 01:07:22.785
- Do you wanna watch some more?
- Yeah. Let's do that.

01:07:57.086 --> 01:07:58.955
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:08:03.926 --> 01:08:06.394
- Cheers.
- Cheers. Thank you.

01:08:10.867 --> 01:08:12.367
Were you...

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:14.669
Were you particularly close
to his parents?

01:08:14.704 --> 01:08:18.808
I mean, have you
spoken to them a lot since

01:08:18.841 --> 01:08:22.845
or got to know them well
when you were with him?

01:08:22.879 --> 01:08:25.346
I got to know them
quite well. Um...

01:08:26.615 --> 01:08:28.017
And I don't know
whether I'm...

01:08:29.919 --> 01:08:31.453
Whether I really am too busy,

01:08:31.486 --> 01:08:34.724
or whether I'm making excuses.
'Cause I've...

01:08:34.756 --> 01:08:35.892
Because I feel as though

01:08:35.925 --> 01:08:37.359
when I see them
and talk to them,

01:08:37.392 --> 01:08:38.560
I feel like I'm...

01:08:42.899 --> 01:08:45.067
"Intruding" isn't the right
word, but I mean...

01:08:46.702 --> 01:08:49.404
You know, they lost
their son, their only son.

01:08:50.139 --> 01:08:51.506
And I...

01:08:53.608 --> 01:08:57.947
I grieved in such
a different way to them.

01:08:59.514 --> 01:09:01.448
And I feel...
I don't feel as though

01:09:01.483 --> 01:09:05.087
I have a place there
as much now.

01:09:06.555 --> 01:09:10.026
It's funny, but I...
I feel really bad

01:09:10.059 --> 01:09:11.993
I haven't been in touch
with them as much.

01:09:14.029 --> 01:09:16.398
Obviously,
I've never been through

01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:17.532
what you've been through,

01:09:17.566 --> 01:09:21.103
but I think... I'm sure from
the parents' point of view,

01:09:21.136 --> 01:09:22.604
they're obviously dealing,
you know,

01:09:22.636 --> 01:09:24.941
with this unimaginable loss

01:09:24.974 --> 01:09:27.910
and, uh... And tragic event,

01:09:27.944 --> 01:09:31.580
but that doesn't, kind of,
mean that you're not, too.

01:09:31.613 --> 01:09:35.151
And I'm sure they're only
sympathetic to that fact.

01:09:35.184 --> 01:09:36.219
And you know, you've...

01:09:36.252 --> 01:09:39.020
I don't think you should,
uh, take it upon yourself

01:09:39.055 --> 01:09:42.058
in a kind of destructive,
negative way.

01:09:42.091 --> 01:09:45.493
Um, from my point of view,
from what you've said,

01:09:45.527 --> 01:09:47.964
um, you shouldn't do that
to yourself.

01:09:48.662 --> 01:09:49.732
Thank you.

01:09:54.704 --> 01:09:57.073
And also, with you,
you know,

01:09:57.106 --> 01:09:59.709
making the film at school,

01:09:59.742 --> 01:10:02.044
which I don't know
whether they know about,

01:10:02.078 --> 01:10:04.113
but I'm sure your family
obviously knows about.

01:10:04.146 --> 01:10:08.117
It's, you know...
It's a brave thing to do and...

01:10:09.752 --> 01:10:12.587
I mean, you know, I think,
I don't think you can...

01:10:12.621 --> 01:10:14.924
What you've gone through
at any stage,

01:10:14.957 --> 01:10:16.625
at any point of your life,

01:10:16.658 --> 01:10:20.428
if this was to happen,
would be unimaginable.

01:10:20.462 --> 01:10:22.732
So for it to happen
at such a young age

01:10:22.765 --> 01:10:25.134
and particularly,
I don't think you can...

01:10:25.167 --> 01:10:27.003
You just can't do that
to yourself.

01:10:27.036 --> 01:10:29.138
It's not...
It's not fair to yourself.

01:10:46.255 --> 01:10:47.924
Do you want another
drink?

01:10:47.957 --> 01:10:49.825
Uh, no, I'm fine,
thank you.

01:10:51.559 --> 01:10:54.529
Um, do you want to come
back to mine for a drink?

01:10:55.965 --> 01:10:57.233
If you have time.

01:10:57.266 --> 01:10:58.901
Uh... This evening?

01:10:58.935 --> 01:11:00.502
Mm-hmm.

01:11:00.535 --> 01:11:02.504
Um... I...

01:11:02.537 --> 01:11:07.109
Actually, I said I would see
my boyfriend this evening.

01:11:07.143 --> 01:11:10.179
Um, so I probably
can't tonight.

01:11:10.212 --> 01:11:12.014
Okay. Yeah.

01:11:12.048 --> 01:11:13.648
No, I understand.

01:11:16.752 --> 01:11:17.853
I'm so sorry,
I misunderstood.

01:11:17.887 --> 01:11:19.155
No, no, no.
No, no, no, it's fine.

01:11:19.188 --> 01:11:20.923
No, I said I'd, uh...

01:11:20.957 --> 01:11:22.191
I said I would cook something.

01:11:22.224 --> 01:11:25.094
He hasn't been very well,
um...

01:11:25.127 --> 01:11:28.064
Uh, for a little while now,
so...

01:11:28.097 --> 01:11:29.799
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

01:11:29.832 --> 01:11:30.900
Um...

01:11:32.034 --> 01:11:33.235
Uh...

01:11:33.269 --> 01:11:35.570
Yeah, so I said
I'd cook him dinner.

01:11:36.604 --> 01:11:37.740
So I should probably do that.

01:11:37.773 --> 01:11:39.742
Yeah.
That's really sweet of you.

01:11:39.775 --> 01:11:42.111
Ah, well,
he hasn't had it yet.

01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:45.613
So, you should probably...

01:11:45.647 --> 01:11:47.249
Yeah, I might run.
Is that all right?

01:11:47.283 --> 01:11:48.583
- No, not at all.
- You sure?

01:11:48.616 --> 01:11:49.752
Yeah, absolutely.
Yeah, completely.

01:11:49.785 --> 01:11:50.920
- Okay.
- I'll see you soon.

01:11:50.953 --> 01:11:52.620
- Yeah, okay.
- Thanks so much.

01:11:52.654 --> 01:11:53.789
Yeah, of course.

01:11:53.823 --> 01:11:55.725
Thank you so much.

01:11:55.758 --> 01:11:59.195
Thank you so... Yeah.
Thanks. Good luck.

01:11:59.228 --> 01:12:00.796
- Thank you.
- Have a nice night.

01:12:00.830 --> 01:12:02.264
Yeah, you, too.
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:12:02.298 --> 01:12:03.665
Yeah, tomorrow.

01:12:15.577 --> 01:12:18.646
<i>♪ Everybody's laughing</i>

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:27.589

01:12:51.914 --> 01:12:53.082
Hello?

01:12:56.152 --> 01:12:57.887
Hi, Barbara. Are you
all right? What's wrong?

01:13:08.364 --> 01:13:09.899
Is he in the hospital?

01:13:10.866 --> 01:13:12.068
Or is he at home?

01:13:20.376 --> 01:13:22.745
No, thank you so much
for calling.

01:13:22.778 --> 01:13:24.180
Can he... Can he talk?

01:13:33.889 --> 01:13:34.957
Do you want me to come?

01:13:34.990 --> 01:13:37.059
Do you want me to come,
Barbara?

01:13:37.093 --> 01:13:38.260
Do you want me
to come to you?

01:13:40.763 --> 01:13:44.033
Yeah, no, of course.
Yeah.

01:13:44.066 --> 01:13:46.668
Thank you so much for calling.
No, no, not at all.

01:13:47.403 --> 01:13:49.004
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

01:13:49.038 --> 01:13:51.673
Okay. Bye-bye.
See you soon.

01:14:30.079 --> 01:14:32.248
I'm struggling
to recognize whether

01:14:33.249 --> 01:14:37.953
I'm, um,
missing Anthony as a whole.

01:14:37.987 --> 01:14:41.891
That, as the person he was,
a very

01:14:41.924 --> 01:14:45.027
- strong individual, he was.
- Mm-hmm.

01:14:45.828 --> 01:14:48.164
And still is in my mind

01:14:48.197 --> 01:14:49.932
- quite present.
- Mm-hmm.

01:14:50.799 --> 01:14:53.102
Or whether I'm missing having

01:14:54.503 --> 01:14:58.240
a companion
and that intimacy.

01:14:59.275 --> 01:15:04.046
And that mysterious leader

01:15:04.079 --> 01:15:08.117
who... Who, you know,
made decisions for me

01:15:09.251 --> 01:15:11.053
and took me places and...
And... And...

01:15:11.086 --> 01:15:13.122
- Helped you be a risk taker.
- Mmm.

01:15:14.256 --> 01:15:16.292
But a controlled
risk taker.

01:15:17.426 --> 01:15:19.028
Controlled by him.

01:15:21.964 --> 01:15:23.265
Keep talking.

01:15:26.468 --> 01:15:30.239
I've... I miss having
that intimacy with someone.

01:15:32.875 --> 01:15:36.345
And... And I don't know
whether I'm quite ready

01:15:36.378 --> 01:15:38.314
to have that
with someone else yet.

01:15:39.248 --> 01:15:41.016
Because I...
I really want it.

01:15:42.051 --> 01:15:43.919
I really want to be able to

01:15:45.221 --> 01:15:47.289
be next to someone in bed.

01:15:47.323 --> 01:15:48.524
And talk to someone who...

01:15:48.557 --> 01:15:51.227
Who I don't go
to film school with.

01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:53.262
- Mm-hmm.
- And who's not my parents

01:15:53.295 --> 01:15:55.197
or Anthony's parents.

01:15:55.231 --> 01:15:56.398
But you do realize,

01:15:56.432 --> 01:15:59.134
you are the one
who can make it happen.

01:15:59.168 --> 01:16:01.036
Do you think
I have to change a bit?

01:16:02.071 --> 01:16:04.106
Well, you won't
change character,

01:16:04.139 --> 01:16:06.075
but you do have to change
a few habits.

01:16:06.108 --> 01:16:08.377
Not only of thinking,
but of being.

01:16:08.410 --> 01:16:10.446
You did it with film school.

01:16:10.479 --> 01:16:13.115
And in film school,
you found acquaintances.

01:16:13.148 --> 01:16:15.551
Now your job is to go...
Job? That's not quite the...

01:16:15.584 --> 01:16:16.785
Yes, your job.

01:16:16.819 --> 01:16:20.222
You're a human being with life to live.
That's your job.

01:17:28.924 --> 01:17:29.992
Patrick.

01:17:30.526 --> 01:17:33.562
Hi. Hi. How are you?

01:17:34.630 --> 01:17:38.901
I am middling.

01:17:38.934 --> 01:17:41.370
- How are you?
- Yeah, middling as well.

01:17:43.238 --> 01:17:45.107
- Good.
- Yeah.

01:17:45.140 --> 01:17:47.009
How's your film?

01:17:47.042 --> 01:17:50.546
I'm not calling it that
any longer.

01:17:50.579 --> 01:17:53.916
I was invited
to leave the edit.

01:17:54.917 --> 01:17:56.251
So...

01:17:58.087 --> 01:18:00.489
I could have made their film.

01:18:01.357 --> 01:18:03.459
But I wanted to make my film,

01:18:03.492 --> 01:18:06.328
so it was an easy decision.

01:18:06.362 --> 01:18:09.898
Oh, I'm sorry
about that.

01:18:09.932 --> 01:18:12.067
I always wanted
to be like Orson Welles.

01:18:13.335 --> 01:18:15.237
Lydia and I
are back together.

01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:17.373
Good! Good, I'm pleased.

01:18:17.406 --> 01:18:19.074
I ground her down.

01:18:20.442 --> 01:18:22.177
She lost that battle.

01:18:22.211 --> 01:18:24.179
Although she's still
in the edit.

01:18:24.613 --> 01:18:26.215
Okay.

01:18:26.248 --> 01:18:28.117
So maybe
she's winning the war.

01:18:30.619 --> 01:18:31.620
How's your memorial?

01:18:32.654 --> 01:18:34.490
Finished now.

01:18:34.523 --> 01:18:36.125
Edit's... It's done.

01:18:36.158 --> 01:18:39.962
So, waiting to graduate.
So we'll see.

01:18:39.995 --> 01:18:42.264
Did you avoid the temptation
to be obvious?

01:18:44.133 --> 01:18:46.335
- I think so.
- That's all you can hope for,

01:18:46.368 --> 01:18:47.403
- isn't it?
- Mmm.

01:18:53.710 --> 01:18:56.311
Do you think Anthony did
work for the Foreign Office?

01:18:56.345 --> 01:18:57.579
In the end?

01:19:03.285 --> 01:19:04.987
Anthony was a junkie.

01:19:07.389 --> 01:19:08.457
Yeah.

01:19:09.658 --> 01:19:11.360
- Okay.
- Onwards.

01:19:14.263 --> 01:19:15.364
That's my direction.

01:19:15.397 --> 01:19:17.032
- I'm this way.
- Good choice.

01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:19.702
- See you soon.
- Good decision.

01:20:54.162 --> 01:20:55.664
<i>Julie,
please come and join me.</i>

01:20:57.199 --> 01:20:58.367
<i>Julie Harte.</i>

01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:06.275
<i>It's a great joy
to see you here, Julie.</i>

01:21:06.308 --> 01:21:08.811
<i>You've, um, bent some rules,</i>

01:21:10.145 --> 01:21:11.580
<i>and it's been a long journey.</i>

01:21:11.613 --> 01:21:15.484
<i>Um, but you've met it with
courage and determination.</i>

01:21:16.585 --> 01:21:18.688
<i>There was a point,
I think, um...</i>

01:21:20.188 --> 01:21:21.758
<i>Jonathan, Steven,
when we didn't think</i>

01:21:21.791 --> 01:21:24.626
<i>we would
see you here graduating.</i>

01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:27.129
<i>But we're all
very proud of you.</i>

01:21:27.162 --> 01:21:30.332
<i>Um, and it's a great,
great, great delight</i>

01:21:30.365 --> 01:21:32.200
<i>to see you graduating,</i>

01:21:32.234 --> 01:21:35.304
<i>and I'm sure you'd like
to say a few words?</i>

01:21:36.204 --> 01:21:37.639
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:21:37.673 --> 01:21:42.678
<i>Um... This, um,
film's dedicated to absent friends,</i>

01:21:43.713 --> 01:21:45.314
<i>um, who couldn't be here.</i>

01:21:45.915 --> 01:21:47.449
<i>And, um,</i>

01:21:47.482 --> 01:21:50.285
<i>if we could all just raise an
imaginary glass of champagne</i>

01:21:50.319 --> 01:21:51.653
<i>to absent friends.</i>

01:21:52.487 --> 01:21:54.189
<i>Um...</i>

01:21:55.725 --> 01:21:57.459
<i>It's my gift
to someone I...</i>

01:21:57.492 --> 01:21:59.762
<i>I once knew
and loved very much.</i>

01:22:01.196 --> 01:22:02.397
<i>Uh, that's all. Thank you.</i>

01:23:01.323 --> 01:23:02.491
<i>You'd like her.</i>

01:23:03.358 --> 01:23:04.559
<i>I love her.</i>

01:23:09.966 --> 01:23:13.435
<i>She's just received word
from her lover</i>

01:23:13.468 --> 01:23:15.872
<i>and she's carving his initial
into the tree.</i>

01:24:23.438 --> 01:24:24.606
<i>You're lost.</i>

01:24:25.942 --> 01:24:28.811
<i>And you'll always be lost.</i>

01:25:14.991 --> 01:25:17.026
<i>Why are they more real
than we are?</i>

01:25:59.401 --> 01:26:00.736
<i>Did you score today?</i>

01:26:00.770 --> 01:26:02.138
<i>Don't lie!
I can't believe you.</i>

01:26:02.171 --> 01:26:03.638
<i>Can you lend me
a couple of quid?</i>

01:26:03.672 --> 01:26:04.606
<i>Mummy...</i>

01:26:04.639 --> 01:26:06.042
<i>Have you got 10?
Gimme 10.</i>

01:26:06.075 --> 01:26:07.710
<i>Can I borrow
some money?</i>

01:26:07.743 --> 01:26:09.477
<i>More money, more money.</i>

01:26:09.511 --> 01:26:11.080
<i>£200.</i>

01:26:11.113 --> 01:26:12.647
<i>If you don't
want to know,</i>

01:26:12.682 --> 01:26:14.649
<i>then don't ask...</i>

01:26:20.089 --> 01:26:21.691
- <i>Desiree...</i>
- <i>What things?</i>

01:26:21.724 --> 01:26:23.558
<i>...Miriam,</i>

01:26:23.592 --> 01:26:24.994
<i>Caroline...</i>

01:26:26.195 --> 01:26:27.964
<i>You're a dark horse,
Julie.</i>

01:26:27.997 --> 01:26:29.631
<i>...and Angela.</i>

01:26:29.664 --> 01:26:31.633
<i>Angela.</i>

01:26:31.666 --> 01:26:32.835
<i>If you don't
want to know...</i>

01:26:34.003 --> 01:26:36.504
<i>I do want to know.
I do want to know.</i>

01:26:38.841 --> 01:26:40.877
<i>Stop torturing yourself.</i>

01:26:40.910 --> 01:26:44.013
<i>Stop inviting me
to torture you.</i>

01:27:09.471 --> 01:27:11.807
<i>Please go away.</i>

01:27:45.207 --> 01:27:46.742
<i>Do you still love me?</i>

01:28:19.141 --> 01:28:21.676
<i>How do you feel about...</i>

01:28:21.711 --> 01:28:22.878
<i>Depends.</i>

01:28:24.646 --> 01:28:25.815
<i>I'd love to.</i>

01:28:30.086 --> 01:28:31.687
<i>You had more disagreements...</i>

01:28:31.721 --> 01:28:32.822
<i>Disagreements?</i>

01:28:32.855 --> 01:28:33.956
<i>You had more disagreements.</i>

01:28:33.990 --> 01:28:35.157
<i>He was strong.</i>

01:28:35.191 --> 01:28:37.760
<i>He didn't know
how to perform his deception.</i>

01:28:39.228 --> 01:28:41.063
<i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

01:28:41.097 --> 01:28:42.698

We're a little later
than we said we'd be...

01:31:41.177 --> 01:31:42.178
Snowy!

01:31:42.211 --> 01:31:43.212
...because of the blasted
underground strike.

01:31:43.245 --> 01:31:45.915
- I mean, it's such a bore.
- Of course, the strike.

01:31:45.948 --> 01:31:47.783
Uh, so did you get a taxi
or what?

01:31:48.250 --> 01:31:50.052
Oh, look!

01:31:50.085 --> 01:31:51.720
- You see?
- See... I see.

01:31:51.754 --> 01:31:53.022
I was trying
to explain it to you.

01:31:53.055 --> 01:31:54.924
- Yes, I understand now.
- It was kinda difficult.

01:31:54.957 --> 01:31:56.859
- I'm sorry, I was being thick.
- And they fold.

01:31:56.892 --> 01:31:59.461
It's a great improvement,
darling, I do see.

01:31:59.495 --> 01:32:02.831
- And they... And they fold up.
- Yeah.

01:32:02.865 --> 01:32:04.500
They've done such a good job.
I just couldn't...

01:32:04.533 --> 01:32:06.735
- I couldn't tell these fold.
- It's marvelous!

01:32:06.769 --> 01:32:08.070
- Yeah.
- With the added bonus

01:32:08.103 --> 01:32:09.738
of getting rid
of that glass

01:32:09.772 --> 01:32:12.174
that one couldn't
stop looking at oneself in.

01:32:12.208 --> 01:32:14.510
- Oh, look...
- Do you want some tea?

01:32:14.543 --> 01:32:16.111
I'd love some.
Fruits of the garden.

01:32:16.145 --> 01:32:17.413
- Look, darling.
- Yeah?

01:32:17.446 --> 01:32:18.981
Put those in water.

01:32:19.014 --> 01:32:20.449
- Thank you, Mummy. Thank you.
- Oh.

01:32:20.482 --> 01:32:21.917
Yeah, I'd love a cup of tea.

01:32:26.288 --> 01:32:27.423
Oh...

01:32:28.924 --> 01:32:32.027
No, I mean,
it's no mean feat getting a taxi

01:32:32.061 --> 01:32:34.396
from King's Cross
at the best of times,

01:32:34.430 --> 01:32:36.365
but finding someone,

01:32:36.398 --> 01:32:39.835
someone who will take
a wild animal

01:32:39.868 --> 01:32:41.170
was quite something.

01:32:41.203 --> 01:32:42.071
Thank you very much.

01:32:42.104 --> 01:32:44.006
We found such...
Such a charming man.

01:32:44.039 --> 01:32:45.341
Actually, do you know what,

01:32:45.374 --> 01:32:47.243
I'm gonna spend a penny
if I may?

01:32:48.344 --> 01:32:50.879
Whoops.

01:33:09.965 --> 01:33:11.066
I squirted myself

01:33:11.100 --> 01:33:15.271
with your heavenly scent
by the sink.

01:33:15.304 --> 01:33:17.406
- Is it Penhaligon's Bluebell?
- Yes.

01:33:17.439 --> 01:33:20.075
Absolutely glorious.

01:33:20.109 --> 01:33:21.910
- Come on, up you come.
- Let me have a smell.

01:33:22.578 --> 01:33:24.113
Absolutely glorious,
isn't it?

01:33:24.146 --> 01:33:26.382
- This is for you.
- What's this? I can't see.

01:33:26.415 --> 01:33:27.449
Just some of the money.

01:33:27.483 --> 01:33:30.152
- Oh, my darling! Really?
- Yeah.

01:33:30.185 --> 01:33:32.021
- You can spare that?
- Mm-hmm.

01:33:32.054 --> 01:33:32.921
'Cause I can wait.

01:33:32.955 --> 01:33:34.590
No, no, no.
You've waited long enough.

01:33:34.623 --> 01:33:36.925
I know you'll pay me back,
but I can wait if you...

01:33:36.959 --> 01:33:38.160
It's fine. No, you...

01:33:38.193 --> 01:33:39.928
It's about time.
It's about time.

01:33:39.962 --> 01:33:41.997
I wouldn't pay you
unless I could.

01:33:42.031 --> 01:33:43.999
- It's all fine.
- Well, thank you very much.

01:33:44.033 --> 01:33:45.234
- Very good.
- Thank you.

01:33:45.267 --> 01:33:46.368
Pleasure doing business
with you.

01:33:48.370 --> 01:33:49.371
Oh, where's my tea?

01:33:53.575 --> 01:33:56.345
Mummy, why are you
still smoking?

01:33:56.378 --> 01:33:58.414
- Mmm.
- It's so horrible.

01:33:59.181 --> 01:34:00.849
I know.

01:34:00.883 --> 01:34:02.418
- New thing.
- I know, I know.

01:34:02.451 --> 01:34:04.153
Well, it's, you know...

01:34:06.155 --> 01:34:08.290
What does Daddy
feel about it?

01:34:08.324 --> 01:34:10.159
Daddy pretends he doesn't
know anything about it.

01:34:10.192 --> 01:34:12.094
That's my... One of my
favorite qualities about him.

01:34:12.127 --> 01:34:13.595
Yes, like a truly
loving person.

01:34:13.629 --> 01:34:16.165
He must really love you.

01:34:16.198 --> 01:34:17.366
I think he must.

01:34:29.645 --> 01:34:31.113
Snowy. Snowy.

01:34:31.146 --> 01:34:32.614
Your hair's getting so long.

01:34:32.648 --> 01:34:34.917
- Yes, I know.
- It's lovely like that.

01:34:34.950 --> 01:34:36.018
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.

01:34:36.051 --> 01:34:38.153
- Good.
- I do.

01:34:38.187 --> 01:34:40.055
Yes, no,
I like it, too.

01:34:40.089 --> 01:34:42.424
It looks quite like
my mother, actually.

01:34:43.425 --> 01:34:46.161
She used to wear
her hair like that.

01:34:46.195 --> 01:34:48.230
Her hair was
a lot darker than mine.

01:34:48.263 --> 01:34:50.532
Yes, but she used to wear it
in a bun like that.

01:34:50.566 --> 01:34:51.934
Mmm.

01:34:51.967 --> 01:34:53.235
And then it was
always so exciting

01:34:53.268 --> 01:34:54.103
when she took it down
at night,

01:34:54.136 --> 01:34:55.537
or if you...
If you caught sight of her.

01:34:55.571 --> 01:34:56.605
You caught her?

01:34:56.638 --> 01:34:58.474
Yeah.

01:34:58.507 --> 01:35:01.410
Are you being
taken care of, yeah? No?

01:35:02.611 --> 01:35:04.380
Okay, okay.
You want us to...

01:35:04.413 --> 01:35:06.148
You look great.

01:35:06.181 --> 01:35:07.516
- Um...
- Is... Is...

01:35:07.549 --> 01:35:10.219
Does Anna know?
Is she moving with camera?

01:35:10.252 --> 01:35:11.320
Like, to just...
Or is she just...

01:35:11.353 --> 01:35:12.689
No. I think
we're gonna try

01:35:12.722 --> 01:35:14.556
one of her static,
turning around like this.

01:35:14.590 --> 01:35:15.792
But just keeping
the eye line.

01:35:15.825 --> 01:35:18.160
And then I was thinking we're
gonna do one by herself.

01:35:18.193 --> 01:35:19.294
- And then she might move.
- Okay. Yep.

01:35:19.328 --> 01:35:21.029
Because then she'll have more
movement with her guitar.

01:35:21.063 --> 01:35:22.231
'Cause I don't want her
to bang into anybody

01:35:22.264 --> 01:35:23.298
if she's moving.

01:35:27.102 --> 01:35:29.471
Um, Anna's coming in
now, Julie. So...

01:35:34.309 --> 01:35:35.577
Hi.

01:35:35.611 --> 01:35:38.046
- So, um...
- You look beautiful.

01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:41.150
On the way to the thing
be careful with your heels,

01:35:41.183 --> 01:35:43.285
'cause we don't want...

01:35:43.318 --> 01:35:45.320
So you wanted her...

01:35:45.354 --> 01:35:47.122
- Just in the center.
- Mm-hmm.

01:35:47.156 --> 01:35:49.358
And you're gonna stand, yes,
and this thing

01:35:49.391 --> 01:35:51.193
- will be turning quite slowly.
- Right.

01:35:51.226 --> 01:35:52.461
And if you ever feel like
you're gonna fall,

01:35:52.494 --> 01:35:53.562
just put your hand up
and we'll stop.

01:35:53.595 --> 01:35:55.130
- Right.
- But I think,

01:35:55.164 --> 01:35:57.266
yeah, you're gonna
be turning with it.

01:35:57.299 --> 01:35:59.268
- Mm-hmm.
- And whenever...

01:36:00.369 --> 01:36:02.705
So we're
gonna run turntable.

01:36:02.739 --> 01:36:06.175
When that's up,
we're gonna roll camera.

01:36:06.208 --> 01:36:08.544
Mark it. Then we're
gonna roll playback.

01:36:08.577 --> 01:36:10.646
It's an eight count
and then we're into it.

01:36:10.679 --> 01:36:12.481
Everyone get that?
Everyone good?

01:36:12.514 --> 01:36:14.383
Yep. Okay. Cool.

01:36:14.416 --> 01:36:17.219
Let me... No, no, no,
carry on, carry on.

01:36:17.252 --> 01:36:18.721
- No? Yeah?
- No, no, yeah. It's good.

01:36:18.755 --> 01:36:20.322
Okay.
All right, then.

01:36:20.355 --> 01:36:23.392
Uh, all right, stand by,
everyone. Nice and quiet.

01:36:23.425 --> 01:36:25.394
Okay,
and James back there,

01:36:25.427 --> 01:36:27.529

Okay,

01:36:31.633 --> 01:36:32.668
Let's standby on this.

01:36:32.702 --> 01:36:34.102
Okay, let's roll camera.

01:36:34.136 --> 01:36:36.038
- Turning over.
- Camera speeding.

01:36:36.071 --> 01:36:37.172
And mark it.

01:36:37.206 --> 01:36:38.640

Happy birthday!

01:39:20.870 --> 01:39:21.738
- How you getting on? Good?
- Thank you.

I'm so good.
You're so pissed already!

01:39:24.373 --> 01:39:26.408
Looking a bit older.

No, you look amazing.

Listen, I got
a little something for you.

01:39:28.577 --> 01:39:29.946
Do you want it

Yeah, please.
Thank you so much.

Lovely dress, by the way.

Thank you.

A lot of work with the
Anti-Poll Tax Federation.

01:39:46.561 --> 01:39:47.596
You know, some people...

01:39:47.629 --> 01:39:50.298
Like talking to some people
about all of that stuff.

01:39:50.332 --> 01:39:51.266
- You know...
- I have heard about it.

01:39:51.299 --> 01:39:54.837
Yeah, I've heard about it
in France. Yeah.

Wine.

01:39:57.974 --> 01:40:00.810
Yes, I do.

01:40:01.844 --> 01:40:03.278
That one.

01:40:10.820 --> 01:40:12.922
No way!
I don't want you around...

01:40:12.955 --> 01:40:14.023
That would be amazing.

01:40:16.859 --> 01:40:18.695
Yes, yes.

01:40:18.728 --> 01:40:21.196
I have so many pictures of me
with this big belly.

01:40:21.964 --> 01:40:23.265
Yes!

01:40:23.298 --> 01:40:24.967
You keep asking me
all these questions.

01:40:25.001 --> 01:40:26.169
I've only just met her.

01:40:26.201 --> 01:40:29.271
Oh, have ya? I thought youse
were a thing for a while.

01:40:29.304 --> 01:40:30.439
Four months,
but, you know,

01:40:30.472 --> 01:40:31.741
- a bit intense for...
- Oh, sorry.

01:40:31.774 --> 01:40:33.275
Oh, lad, I can't help it.
I get on the wind up,

01:40:33.308 --> 01:40:34.342
- don't I?
- Yeah, I know.

01:40:34.376 --> 01:40:35.310
- I didn't make it.
- You brought it?

01:40:35.343 --> 01:40:36.411
- I did not...
- Well, who brought it, then?

01:40:36.445 --> 01:40:39.514
I didn't. I didn't bring
that, I just saw it outside.

01:40:39.548 --> 01:40:40.582
I thought it was
from the party.

01:40:40.615 --> 01:40:41.684
You... What? You...

01:40:41.718 --> 01:40:43.418
Sorry? You found it outside
in the street or what?

01:40:43.452 --> 01:40:46.421
No, no, no. It just didn't...
It was by the door.

01:40:49.624 --> 01:40:50.727
It's a joke?

01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:53.763
It was just...
It was outside the front door.

01:40:53.796 --> 01:40:54.931
- You are joking?
- Nah! I brought it.

01:40:54.964 --> 01:40:55.998
I made it.
I made it, I made it!

01:40:56.032 --> 01:40:57.166
I was like,
"I've already eaten half of it."

01:40:57.200 --> 01:40:59.802
- I made it, but it comes from a can.
- It looks delicious.

01:41:11.748 --> 01:41:12.949
Here we go.

01:41:17.519 --> 01:41:18.553
Ooh.

01:41:18.587 --> 01:41:20.422
Everybody, say, "Thirty!"

01:41:20.455 --> 01:41:23.592
Thirty!

01:41:27.730 --> 01:41:29.498
There you are.
Fuckin' hell, that's it.

01:41:29.531 --> 01:41:30.599
There we go.

01:41:32.969 --> 01:41:36.571
Are we to be, uh, expecting
someone at any point?

01:41:36.605 --> 01:41:37.807
- What do you mean?
- I thought maybe

01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:39.474
a fine young gentleman
in your life?

01:41:39.508 --> 01:41:40.710
"Fine young gen..."
No. Absolutely not.

01:41:40.743 --> 01:41:41.576
- No?
- No.

01:41:41.610 --> 01:41:43.612
- No, you're not with anyone?
- No. Just me.

01:41:43.645 --> 01:41:44.881
- Good.
- I'm really happy.

01:41:44.914 --> 01:41:47.984
Good. Cheers, mate.
As it should be. Come here.
