â™ª

00:08.260 --> 00:12.000
[indistinct chatter]

00:12.043 --> 00:13.000
MAN:
Amanda went all out.

00:13.043 --> 00:14.260
Help yourself.

00:14.304 --> 00:15.608
Can I top you off?

00:15.652 --> 00:18.260
Ask me again
when you turn 21.

00:18.304 --> 00:20.913
Hey, hey, I'm not drinking,
I'm just serving.

00:20.956 --> 00:22.695
Not anymore.
Uh, actually,

00:22.739 --> 00:24.739
Virginia law states that
persons 18 years of age

00:24.782 --> 00:26.043
or older are permitted
to serve alcohol.

00:26.086 --> 00:27.347
Oh, really?

00:27.391 --> 00:29.869
Yeah, look, I brought
a copy of the statute.

00:29.913 --> 00:32.043
You know, Nathan,
you'd have a lot more friends

00:32.086 --> 00:33.695
if you didn't do things
like this.

00:33.739 --> 00:35.826
WOMAN:
Okay, everybody, get
in your places, here he comes.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.173
Oh, come on,
guys, he's here.

00:38.478 --> 00:39.826
[door unlocking]

00:42.217 --> 00:44.217
ALL:
Surprise!

00:45.260 --> 00:47.260
Welcome home!
Hi, Tommy!

00:52.608 --> 00:54.260
[guests gasping]

00:54.304 --> 00:55.521
Son.

00:55.565 --> 00:56.565
No, Tommy.

01:29.086 --> 01:31.086
[elevator bell dings,
phone ringing]

01:34.913 --> 01:36.956
Uh-oh, did I miss
someone's birthday?

01:37.000 --> 01:38.695
No, this is for Tony.

01:38.739 --> 01:40.043
Huh, what's the occasion?

01:40.086 --> 01:42.000
Well, it has not been the
best of weeks for him,

01:42.043 --> 01:43.956
so I thought he could
use some cheering up.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.913
Yeah, I noticed.

01:45.956 --> 01:47.652
I actually got him
something, too.

01:47.695 --> 01:49.217
It's not much,
but hopefully

01:49.260 --> 01:50.782
it'll take his mind
off things.

01:50.826 --> 01:52.217
I just can't stand
all the moping.

01:52.260 --> 01:54.434
I have not been moping.

01:54.478 --> 01:57.217
Been a little dejected,
apathetic perhaps.

01:57.260 --> 01:59.304
That's actually the definition
of the word "moping."

01:59.347 --> 02:00.913
Is it really?

02:00.956 --> 02:05.000
Well, let's just see what
the dictionary app has to say.

02:06.043 --> 02:08.521
Oh, you're right.

02:08.565 --> 02:10.173
What is going on with me?

02:10.217 --> 02:11.521
My memory is like a...

02:11.565 --> 02:12.782
it's that damn
concussion.

02:12.826 --> 02:14.000
Huh.

02:14.043 --> 02:15.217
Then I guess
you won't be needing this.

02:15.260 --> 02:16.521
Or this.

02:16.565 --> 02:19.000
What are "thises"?

02:19.043 --> 02:20.956
Gifts to cheer you up.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Well, I have been feeling

02:23.043 --> 02:24.173
a little mopey.

02:24.217 --> 02:25.956
Thank you.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.956
Very sweet of you.

02:28.956 --> 02:31.000
Oh.

02:31.043 --> 02:34.000
Two tickets
to female mud wrestling.

02:34.826 --> 02:35.826
Thanks.

02:35.869 --> 02:38.043
Uh, I'll have to put a pin
in that.

02:38.086 --> 02:41.608
And Original Recipe Probie.

02:41.652 --> 02:42.869
Very sweet,

02:42.913 --> 02:45.391
very nice.

02:46.608 --> 02:47.956
Two more tickets to
female mud wrestling.

02:48.000 --> 02:48.782
[laughs]

02:48.826 --> 02:49.826
[chuckles]

02:49.869 --> 02:51.043
How old do you
guys think I am?

02:51.086 --> 02:52.739
Physically or mentally?

02:52.782 --> 02:53.913
What, is this a, a gag gift?

02:53.956 --> 02:55.913
You guys planned this together?

02:55.956 --> 02:57.869
DiNozzo, I got
a gift for you.

02:57.913 --> 02:59.217
Dead body?

02:59.260 --> 03:00.000
Yep.

03:00.043 --> 03:01.043
Grab our gear?

03:01.086 --> 03:02.826
Yep.
Thank you, boss.

03:02.869 --> 03:04.260
A gift I can use.

03:04.304 --> 03:06.304
Only thing I need to do
right now is keep working.

03:06.347 --> 03:08.652
See, this is what I need--
work-- keep me busy.

03:08.695 --> 03:13.217
Good, I think
we can still get refunds.

03:15.086 --> 03:17.086
Never said I didn't want them.

03:21.434 --> 03:23.217
Private First Class
Thomas Hill

03:23.260 --> 03:24.217
just returned
from deployment

03:24.260 --> 03:25.956
in Afghanistan the prior week.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.521
The party was
to welcome him home.

03:27.565 --> 03:28.521
Nice welcome.

03:28.565 --> 03:29.521
Yeah, apparently
he was

03:29.565 --> 03:30.695
also going to be
the grand marshal

03:30.739 --> 03:31.695
at something called

03:31.739 --> 03:33.478
the homecoming parade?

03:33.521 --> 03:35.739
They don't have homecoming
in Israel?

03:35.782 --> 03:37.173
DUCKY:
They wouldn't.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.043
Homecoming is a distinctively
American tradition.

03:39.086 --> 03:40.304
Actually it began...

03:40.347 --> 03:42.521
JIMMY:
In 1911 at the University
of Missouri

03:42.565 --> 03:45.826
under Athletic Director
Chester Brewer.

03:45.869 --> 03:47.956
Yes, however, it is
interesting to note...

03:48.000 --> 03:50.043
That that year is a matter
of some contention.

03:50.086 --> 03:51.217
In fact...

03:52.217 --> 03:53.478
I'm sorry, Doctor,
I interrupted you.

03:53.521 --> 03:54.478
Please continue.

03:54.521 --> 03:55.826
Can we continue working?

03:55.869 --> 03:57.000
Good idea.

03:57.043 --> 03:58.260
Come on.

03:58.913 --> 04:00.869
I remember
my last homecoming.

04:00.913 --> 04:02.347
The parade,
the game,

04:02.391 --> 04:04.826
stringing Stinky John up
the flagpole by his underwear.

04:05.956 --> 04:07.347
Good times.

04:07.391 --> 04:09.000
Says the man too mature
for female mud wrestling.

04:09.043 --> 04:10.478
DUCKY:
Time of death

04:10.521 --> 04:13.565
is a matter of record, and
we have a preliminary cause.

04:14.304 --> 04:15.521
He's stabbed to death, Duck?

04:15.565 --> 04:17.956
Yes, there are multiple
sharp force traumas.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.478
And there's more
blood outside.

04:19.521 --> 04:21.913
Still have to check the area
to find out where it leads.

04:21.956 --> 04:22.956
So far, no witnesses.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.565
Take Ziva with you.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.043
ZIVA:
So,

04:28.086 --> 04:29.956
what exactly is
homecoming and why

04:30.000 --> 04:32.478
does underwear play
such an important role?

04:33.043 --> 04:35.000
It doesn't,
at least as long

04:35.043 --> 04:36.260
as Tony's not involved.

04:36.304 --> 04:38.304
Homecoming in a
small town like this

04:38.347 --> 04:39.826
is usually a pretty big deal.

04:39.869 --> 04:41.782
Then, if Private
Hill was going

04:41.826 --> 04:43.130
to be this
grand marshal...

04:43.173 --> 04:45.043
Then he was
a pretty big deal, too.

04:45.086 --> 04:47.739
I hope the murder
wasn't too far.

04:47.782 --> 04:50.608
I hate spread-out
crime scenes.

04:50.652 --> 04:52.913
Then I think you're in luck.

04:54.739 --> 04:56.260
Is that a
cell phone?

04:57.304 --> 04:59.000
No, wait, ho... hold on!

04:59.043 --> 05:00.000
Hey!
Hold... no, no!

05:00.043 --> 05:02.000
Wait!No, hold on, hold on!

05:02.043 --> 05:03.130
Stop, stop!

05:03.173 --> 05:05.869
Stop, stop it, stop!

05:16.043 --> 05:17.565
TONY:
Ugh, stinky.

05:17.608 --> 05:18.956
[groans]

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
[spits]

05:25.086 --> 05:26.956
We'll never find
that cell phone.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Oh!

05:29.043 --> 05:30.434
How many more
are there?

05:30.478 --> 05:32.130
Another 30 or so.

05:32.173 --> 05:34.608
Next time why don't you
just shoot the driver?

05:34.652 --> 05:36.000
[elevator bell dings]Next time I will.

05:37.695 --> 05:40.347
Here, put these on.

05:40.391 --> 05:42.347
Oh, excellent.

05:44.478 --> 05:46.000
Thanks.

05:46.043 --> 05:48.826
I hate face masks.

05:48.869 --> 05:50.391
They make me
claustrophobic.

05:50.434 --> 05:53.173
Well, so will the iron lung
you're going to call home

05:53.217 --> 05:55.521
when you get silicosis
from all the silica dust.

05:57.869 --> 06:00.565
Wait, aren't you going
to stay and help?

06:00.608 --> 06:03.130
Ah, that is so sweet
of you to ask,

06:03.173 --> 06:05.434
but my job is
to process the evidence,

06:05.478 --> 06:07.217
not to find it.

06:07.260 --> 06:09.260
I would never want
to take that away from you.

06:09.304 --> 06:10.000
[elevator bell dings]

06:10.043 --> 06:12.086
Okay, let's hear it.

06:16.869 --> 06:19.000
As you were.

06:21.043 --> 06:22.217
Private First Class
Thomas Hill--

06:22.260 --> 06:24.173
Tommy Toms
to his friends.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.695
He was abandoned by his
drug-addicted mother as a kid,

06:26.739 --> 06:28.000
spent the rest of his childhood

06:28.043 --> 06:29.652
in the foster care system.Eventually

06:29.695 --> 06:32.043
he ended up getting adopted
by a military family.

06:32.086 --> 06:33.130
Found the cell phone.

06:33.173 --> 06:34.869
I'll alert ZNN.

06:34.913 --> 06:36.521
Guy's record was
impeccable, boss.

06:36.565 --> 06:38.260
Not one person had anything
bad to say about him,

06:38.304 --> 06:39.304
including
his fellow marines.

06:39.347 --> 06:41.000
TONY:
Neighbors.Superiors.

06:41.043 --> 06:43.086
Everybody loved this guy.

06:43.130 --> 06:45.173
GIBBS:
He's dead, DiNozzo.

06:45.217 --> 06:47.000
Not everybody.

06:49.043 --> 06:53.130
It's my fault
Tommy is dead.

06:53.173 --> 06:55.217
Please stop saying that,
Lindsey.

06:55.260 --> 07:00.086
I was supposed to meet him after
his shift, like, a block away.

07:00.130 --> 07:03.739
It was my job to bring him
to his party, but...

07:03.782 --> 07:06.260
he never showed up.

07:06.304 --> 07:10.000
Whoever did this...
is going to pay.

07:11.391 --> 07:13.347
It's not your fault.

07:13.391 --> 07:17.347
But if I was there, maybe
I could have done something.

07:17.391 --> 07:21.478
Yeah, or maybe your parents
would be sitting here alone.

07:22.521 --> 07:26.217
I wish they were
my parents.

07:26.260 --> 07:30.043
Lindsey came to us
two years ago, two

07:30.086 --> 07:32.043
blessed years.

07:32.086 --> 07:34.043
We're not
her parents,

07:34.086 --> 07:35.217
no, but we are her family.

07:35.260 --> 07:37.217
Just tell us
what you need to know

07:37.260 --> 07:40.043
to find the son of a bitch
who killed Tommy.

07:40.086 --> 07:44.043
I hear he was
a good kid.

07:44.086 --> 07:45.043
Everybody feel
that way?

07:45.086 --> 07:46.478
Never met one
who didn't.

07:46.521 --> 07:49.869
He was the star
quarterback.

07:49.913 --> 07:52.260
Everybody liked him.

07:52.304 --> 07:53.608
Couldn't help it.

07:53.652 --> 07:56.260
Never in trouble
a day in his life.

07:56.304 --> 07:58.043
How about you?

07:58.086 --> 08:00.347
Not nearly as well liked.

08:00.391 --> 08:01.739
Sue me.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.869
Most trouble
I've ever been in was

08:03.913 --> 08:06.565
almost losing
our house last year,

08:06.608 --> 08:08.000
like the rest
of the world.

08:08.043 --> 08:11.347
I did notice something unusual.

08:11.391 --> 08:12.782
Go on.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.086
It was

08:14.130 --> 08:16.173
a few days after he came home
from deployment.

08:16.217 --> 08:17.956
He... something
was bothering him.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.869
He said it was
nothing, but I...

08:20.913 --> 08:22.826
I knew he was lying.

08:22.869 --> 08:24.391
He was

08:24.434 --> 08:26.086
a good kid, Agent Gibbs.

08:31.695 --> 08:34.347
Amazing, remarkable,

08:34.391 --> 08:36.347
totally unbelievable.

08:36.391 --> 08:37.608
What do you got, Abbs?

08:37.652 --> 08:40.956
A newfound respect
for my old homecoming dress.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.478
I loved it
when I wore it

08:42.521 --> 08:44.782
and then I banned its mention
during the next decade,

08:44.826 --> 08:46.347
but I'm kind of
coming around again.

08:46.391 --> 08:48.347
All that's missing
is a dog collar.

08:48.391 --> 08:50.739
Which one was
the lucky guy?

08:50.782 --> 08:52.826
Um, all of them.

08:52.869 --> 08:54.086
They all asked me

08:54.130 --> 08:56.521
to the dance, and I
couldn't bear to say no,

08:56.565 --> 08:59.000
so I kind of talked all three
of 'em into taking me.

08:59.043 --> 09:01.391
Hmm, how'd
that work out?

09:01.434 --> 09:02.739
Well,

09:02.782 --> 09:04.739
let's just say it might be

09:04.782 --> 09:07.739
what got me interested
in my first crime scene.

09:07.782 --> 09:09.043
Speaking of...

09:09.086 --> 09:12.434
this is the cell phone
that McGee found.

09:12.478 --> 09:13.782
I'm operating under
the assumption

09:13.826 --> 09:14.956
that it belongs
to the killer.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Not big on assumptions,
especially today.

09:17.043 --> 09:18.043
I know,

09:18.086 --> 09:20.391
but right now this
is all I've got.

09:20.434 --> 09:21.695
It's been
modified to wipe

09:21.739 --> 09:23.826
its memory if the
wrong password

09:23.869 --> 09:25.043
is entered too many times,

09:25.086 --> 09:27.695
but this blood is PFC Hill's

09:27.739 --> 09:29.130
and the spatter suggests
that the cell phone

09:29.173 --> 09:30.521
was really close to whoever did

09:30.565 --> 09:32.478
the stabbing,
like on his hip.

09:32.521 --> 09:34.000
Am I forgiven?

09:34.043 --> 09:36.608
Get inside,
I'll think about it.

09:36.652 --> 09:38.043
All right, I still have a
few tricks up my sleeve.

09:38.086 --> 09:40.521
However, I did get into

09:40.565 --> 09:42.434
his laptop and I
found something

09:42.478 --> 09:44.043
very interesting.

09:44.086 --> 09:47.391
He spent the last three days
trying to hack

09:47.434 --> 09:49.478
into the Virginia State
Web site.

09:49.521 --> 09:50.695
Looking for what?Good question.

09:50.739 --> 09:52.304
He never got in,

09:52.347 --> 09:54.956
but what's interesting about
the laptop is where it's been.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.043
Its 4G modem
records

09:57.086 --> 09:59.478
location data whenever
it connects to a cell tower.

09:59.521 --> 10:01.695
This laptop
has not left town

10:01.739 --> 10:04.000
except for once six months ago.

10:04.043 --> 10:06.173
The location

10:06.217 --> 10:08.608
is 200 feet off
the nearest hiking trail--

10:08.652 --> 10:10.043
middle of nowhere.

10:10.086 --> 10:11.130
I mean,
not the kind of place

10:11.173 --> 10:12.260
you'd expect someone
to bring a laptop.

10:12.304 --> 10:14.260
I smell foulness.

10:15.608 --> 10:18.260
Liked the dress, Abbs.

10:18.304 --> 10:20.478
Thanks.

10:20.521 --> 10:21.869
[sighs]

10:21.913 --> 10:23.217
Are we there yet?

10:23.260 --> 10:25.391
The more you ask, the
longer it's gonna take.

10:25.434 --> 10:27.086
Oh, really, so there's
some magical connection

10:27.130 --> 10:30.086
between my mouth
and distance?

10:30.130 --> 10:32.347
No, but there is between
your mouth and annoyance.

10:32.391 --> 10:34.043
[beeps]Ah,

10:34.086 --> 10:35.000
but thankfully
we are here.

10:35.043 --> 10:36.000
Hmm.

10:36.043 --> 10:38.043
All right,
what are we looking for?

10:38.086 --> 10:39.347
I don't know, but

10:39.391 --> 10:41.869
I got a feeling
something is buried right there.

10:43.086 --> 10:44.434
No.

10:44.478 --> 10:45.739
I pulled a dead,
bloated corpse

10:45.782 --> 10:47.260
out of a hot tub
last year, okay?

10:47.304 --> 10:49.130
This is your turn.

10:49.173 --> 10:51.000
I'll give you $200.

10:51.043 --> 10:53.086
Deal.

10:53.130 --> 10:55.478
Though I would've
taken $50.

10:55.521 --> 10:57.000
Really?

10:57.043 --> 11:00.000
Well, let's just
consider the other $150

11:00.043 --> 11:01.391
nerd restitution, huh?

11:01.434 --> 11:03.043
Excuse me?

11:03.086 --> 11:06.173
You must have been teased pretty
badly in high school, huh?

11:06.217 --> 11:08.739
Uh, actually, no, I wasn't.

11:08.782 --> 11:11.739
If you don't want to talk
about it, it's okay.

11:13.043 --> 11:15.347
Feeling guilty about something?No.

11:15.391 --> 11:17.347
I mean, not guilty, just...

11:19.086 --> 11:21.086
...reflective.

11:22.043 --> 11:24.391
I strung this kid
up by his underwear

11:24.434 --> 11:25.782
when I was in boarding school.

11:25.826 --> 11:29.043
Right. Yes, Stinky John.
Yeah.

11:29.086 --> 11:31.434
Strung him up by his tighty
whities off the flagpole

11:31.478 --> 11:32.826
20 feet in the air.

11:32.869 --> 11:35.086
Remarkably not cool of me.

11:35.130 --> 11:37.608
No, it wasn't.

11:37.652 --> 11:38.913
Who does something like that?

11:38.956 --> 11:40.565
I'm a big fan of
practical jokes.

11:40.608 --> 11:42.086
'Cause they're funny,
but nobody gets hurt.

11:42.130 --> 11:44.173
I mean, you could really
hurt a kid doing that.

11:44.217 --> 11:45.217
And he was just a kid.

11:45.260 --> 11:47.217
Think about it-- a kid.

11:47.260 --> 11:49.000
Yep. And so were you.

11:49.043 --> 11:51.000
But at least you
finally figured it out.

11:52.217 --> 11:53.043
Ah.

11:54.565 --> 11:55.913
Look at that.
We got something.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.043
There's a lock.

12:03.086 --> 12:04.521
Look at you.

12:04.565 --> 12:05.652
All resourceful.

12:05.695 --> 12:07.434
All right.

12:11.043 --> 12:13.043
Huh.

12:13.086 --> 12:14.565
So that's what Private Hill
buried-- treasure.

12:14.608 --> 12:16.086
Should've seen that coming.

12:16.130 --> 12:18.043
There's got to be
50 grand in here.

12:18.086 --> 12:23.391
Well, I guess our... perfect
kid wasn't quite so perfect.

12:32.086 --> 12:35.695
DUCKY:
It was the most exciting
moment of my life.

12:35.739 --> 12:37.608
My heart rate
accelerated wildly,

12:37.652 --> 12:41.173
and my spinal reflexes
were totally disinhibited.

12:41.217 --> 12:42.434
Did she say yes?

12:42.478 --> 12:43.869
Well, of course she did.

12:43.913 --> 12:46.434
And then we had a wonderful
time at the dance.

12:46.478 --> 12:48.130
I went to all
my school dances.

12:48.173 --> 12:50.478
In fact, you know, he and I
have something in common.

12:50.521 --> 12:53.086
We were both elected
homecoming king.

12:53.130 --> 12:55.043
Yes, on what merits
did you get elected?

12:55.086 --> 12:56.782
It was a charter school.

12:56.826 --> 12:59.565
There were only 12 kids
in my class, so...

12:59.608 --> 13:02.782
Still, your fellow students
chose you above the others.

13:02.826 --> 13:05.434
Unless, of course...

13:05.478 --> 13:08.434
The other 11 were girls.

13:08.478 --> 13:09.521
Oh, look! Agent Gibbs.

13:09.565 --> 13:11.173
Ziva said you
found something?

13:11.217 --> 13:13.869
Yes, I did. And I
understand you did as well.

13:13.913 --> 13:17.434
A rather large quantity of cash
associated with this fellow.

13:17.478 --> 13:19.130
Abby's processing it now.

13:19.173 --> 13:21.478
Do we have any idea
where it came from?

13:21.521 --> 13:23.565
Don't you have
a pipette to clean?

13:23.608 --> 13:25.956
Always. Pipettes can
never be too clean.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.434
Jimmy's rule number one.

13:31.565 --> 13:33.565
I haven't begun
the formal autopsy yet,

13:33.608 --> 13:36.521
but an examination
of his epidermis revealed

13:36.565 --> 13:39.043
this small puncture wound.

13:39.086 --> 13:40.869
It's from a syringe.

13:40.913 --> 13:42.782
I was able to retrieve the tip,

13:42.826 --> 13:44.391
which had broken off inside.

13:44.434 --> 13:46.217
Which strongly suggests...

13:46.260 --> 13:47.869
Injection wasn't voluntary.

13:47.913 --> 13:49.652
No. Nor was it complete.

13:49.695 --> 13:51.956
The drug never reached
his circulatory system.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.739
But there was enough material

13:53.782 --> 13:56.956
inside the syringe for
Abby to identify it.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.304
Sedative.

13:58.347 --> 14:00.434
And a strong one, too.

14:00.478 --> 14:02.608
But what interests me the most

14:02.652 --> 14:05.347
is the clotting
around the wound.

14:05.391 --> 14:09.086
It tells me that
the injection

14:09.130 --> 14:11.217
was attempted before
the stabbing.

14:11.260 --> 14:13.217
Attacker wasn't trying
to kill him.

14:13.260 --> 14:17.000
Yes, well, it could be
an attempted kidnapping,

14:17.043 --> 14:18.782
followed by
a struggle.

14:18.826 --> 14:21.086
And then a murder.

14:23.695 --> 14:26.043
If you can find
the rest of the syringe,

14:26.086 --> 14:28.130
you may get a clue
as to its owner.

14:32.043 --> 14:34.000
[people chattering]

14:47.521 --> 14:48.913
What are they doing here?

14:48.956 --> 14:50.173
Their son has just
been murdered,

14:50.217 --> 14:52.043
and they're decorating
a parade float?

14:52.086 --> 14:54.347
Well, people grieve
in different ways.

14:54.391 --> 14:56.956
Those are kids, so try not
to upset anyone, okay?

14:57.000 --> 14:59.260
Thanks, guys.

14:59.304 --> 15:02.608
I know Tommy would've
appreciated it.

15:02.652 --> 15:04.869
Agent McGee, David.

15:04.913 --> 15:07.608
Tell me you found
my son's killer.

15:07.652 --> 15:09.000
We have not
caught anyone.

15:09.043 --> 15:11.217
We just need to take another
look at the crime scene.

15:11.260 --> 15:13.826
Is there anything
we can do to help?

15:13.869 --> 15:15.217
Uh, no, we've got it.

15:15.260 --> 15:16.434
Um, Nathan.

15:16.478 --> 15:18.521
I'm Lindsey's, um...

15:18.565 --> 15:20.521
We're kind of...

15:20.565 --> 15:21.782
We're taking it slow.

15:21.826 --> 15:23.043
Right. That's
what I meant.

15:23.086 --> 15:25.173
Well, Mr. and
Mrs. McCormick,

15:25.217 --> 15:28.043
since you're here, there are a
few things we need to clear up.

15:28.086 --> 15:30.043
Yes, anything.

15:30.086 --> 15:32.695
Did Private...
sorry, uh, your son,

15:32.739 --> 15:35.000
did he ever show any interest
in computer hacking?

15:35.043 --> 15:37.000
Tommy?

15:37.043 --> 15:38.391
[chuckles]

15:38.434 --> 15:39.956
Wouldn't even
pirate music.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.086
He'd spend his whole
allowance every week

15:42.130 --> 15:44.130
to buy a new CD.

15:44.173 --> 15:46.347
Did you notice him having a lot
of extra cash around lately?

15:46.391 --> 15:48.652
I don't like what
you're implying.

15:48.695 --> 15:51.608
I'm not implying anything,
I'm just asking a few questions.

15:51.652 --> 15:53.173
Well, I don't like
your questions.

15:53.217 --> 15:54.391
Me, neither.

15:54.434 --> 15:56.000
Don't you guys have
something better to do?

15:56.043 --> 15:57.956
Yes.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.173
And they were just
leaving to do it.

16:01.695 --> 16:03.695
Um, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to offend you.

16:03.739 --> 16:05.043
Your shoes
offended me.

16:05.086 --> 16:06.521
Okay, hold on.

16:06.565 --> 16:07.869
Let's just calm down, okay?

16:07.913 --> 16:08.826
You find them
in a Dumpster?

16:08.869 --> 16:10.217
I paid over $200
for these shoes.

16:10.260 --> 16:11.869
GIRL:
You got ripped off.

16:11.913 --> 16:13.608
Like you did with
that haircut.

16:13.652 --> 16:16.434
BOY:
And what's with the
bags under your eyes?

16:16.478 --> 16:18.000
Come on, McGee.
Loser.

16:18.043 --> 16:21.043
Let's see if we can
find that syringe.

16:21.086 --> 16:22.565
[elevator bell dings]

16:22.608 --> 16:24.739
No, McGee, you do not have
bags under your eyes.

16:24.782 --> 16:26.043
They're just trying
to get your sheep.

16:26.086 --> 16:27.521
Goat. You sure?

16:27.565 --> 16:29.521
'Cause I've noticed
in the past week.
I am sure.

16:29.565 --> 16:30.652
You find a syringe?

16:30.695 --> 16:33.043
Actually, two.

16:33.086 --> 16:35.565
The killer tried to hide it
in a neighbor's trash bin.

16:35.608 --> 16:38.217
We sent the prints to Abby;
she's running them now.

16:38.260 --> 16:39.782
McGee made several new friends.

16:39.826 --> 16:43.304
Couple kids piled on
at the crime scene.

16:43.347 --> 16:46.826
Felt like I was
back in high school again.

16:46.869 --> 16:49.391
I thought you said you weren't
teased in high school.

16:49.434 --> 16:50.695
I wasn't.

16:50.739 --> 16:52.130
Okay.

16:52.173 --> 16:55.086
I-I'm gonna leave it at that,
because I'm your friend.

16:55.130 --> 16:56.695
And if you don't want
to talk about it,

16:56.739 --> 16:59.391
then-then that's great,
and I can respect that.

17:01.217 --> 17:02.391
But I need a favor.

17:02.434 --> 17:04.043
[laughs]
That's more like it.

17:05.869 --> 17:07.826
I'm trying to track
somebody down.

17:07.869 --> 17:09.391
I'm having a little
bit of trouble.

17:09.434 --> 17:11.217
Who?

17:11.260 --> 17:13.304
John.

17:13.347 --> 17:16.000
You wouldn't, by any chance,
be talking about Stinky John?

17:16.043 --> 17:17.043
I would.

17:17.086 --> 17:18.260
His last name is Smith.

17:18.304 --> 17:20.043
You know how many John Smiths
there are?

17:20.086 --> 17:21.304
It's like a million of them.

17:21.347 --> 17:23.000
Why on earth would you
try to find the man

17:23.043 --> 17:24.043
that you strung up
by his underwear?

17:24.086 --> 17:25.260
To do it again?

17:25.304 --> 17:27.173
Well, I just thought
I might want to say hi.

17:27.217 --> 17:28.652
Right?

17:28.695 --> 17:30.913
Maybe, uh, buy
him a beer.

17:30.956 --> 17:32.695
Maybe apologize.

17:32.739 --> 17:34.043
I mean,

17:34.086 --> 17:35.391
maybe just sorry.

17:35.434 --> 17:36.565
Eh, that's weak.

17:36.608 --> 17:38.086
I don't know,
but something like that.

17:38.130 --> 17:40.391
All right, Tony.

17:40.434 --> 17:41.956
I'd be happy to help.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.043
Thank you.

17:43.086 --> 17:44.130
Look sharp.

17:44.173 --> 17:46.173
Hey, boss.

17:46.217 --> 17:48.739
Still, uh, no luck on
where Private Hill's

17:48.782 --> 17:52.086
cash stash came from, but I did
find some interesting-ness.

17:53.608 --> 17:55.043
Hill's parents
were six months behind

17:55.086 --> 17:56.347
on their mortgage payments,

17:56.391 --> 17:57.956
then suddenly paid off
the entire balance.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.782
In cash.
A lot of cash.

17:59.826 --> 18:02.304
And McGee and I were able
to retrieve the missing syringe.

18:02.347 --> 18:05.739
I know. Abby already got a
match on the prints. McGee.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.173
[beeps]

18:09.217 --> 18:11.000
Curtis Beane.

18:11.043 --> 18:12.956
He's got a record
a mile long, but

18:13.000 --> 18:14.260
he hasn't been in trouble
in years.

18:14.304 --> 18:15.739
According to his parole reports,
he's worked

18:15.782 --> 18:17.130
at the same place
since he got out.

18:17.173 --> 18:19.478
DiNozzo, BOLO.
On it.

18:19.521 --> 18:22.000
Ziva, with me.

18:22.043 --> 18:23.391
[horn honking]

18:23.434 --> 18:25.391
MAN:
Sorry, no.

18:25.434 --> 18:27.260
I haven't seen Curtis
in, like, two days.

18:27.304 --> 18:30.478
And, to be honest,
I'm a little bit worried.

18:30.521 --> 18:32.347
Why is that?

18:32.391 --> 18:34.086
He's one of my
best managers.

18:34.130 --> 18:35.826
He's been with me
since the beginning.

18:35.869 --> 18:37.478
Not like him to
just disappear.

18:37.521 --> 18:40.130
You are aware that
he's a convicted felon, right?

18:40.173 --> 18:42.086
Everybody here's
a convicted felon.

18:42.130 --> 18:43.695
That's why it's called
Second Chance.

18:43.739 --> 18:45.826
So what's your
beef with Curtis?

18:45.869 --> 18:48.043
Found his prints
at a murder scene.

18:48.086 --> 18:49.956
No way.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.913
No, must be some mistake.

18:51.956 --> 18:53.652
Yeah, Curtis has been clean
for years.

18:53.695 --> 18:55.173
No, there is no mistake.

18:55.217 --> 18:57.217
This man was murdered
yesterday.

18:58.913 --> 19:00.652
Wow. So young.

19:00.695 --> 19:01.956
You know, I don't know why

19:02.000 --> 19:03.260
Curtis's prints
are at your crime scene,

19:03.304 --> 19:04.739
but there's not
a chance in hell

19:04.782 --> 19:06.173
he was gonna risk
going back to jail.

19:06.217 --> 19:08.043
He had a tough
time in the joint.

19:08.086 --> 19:10.565
If you do, uh, hear from him,

19:10.608 --> 19:12.260
let us know, huh?

19:18.043 --> 19:20.695
Look, I understand your pain.

19:20.739 --> 19:23.000
I mean, no one wants
their secrets revealed.

19:23.043 --> 19:24.913
But you had something
that I needed.

19:24.956 --> 19:26.826
You had something that
Leroy Jethro Gibbs needed,

19:26.869 --> 19:29.652
and that is a man that you
do not want to disappoint.

19:29.695 --> 19:31.217
Never have before, Abbs.

19:31.260 --> 19:34.260
Actually, I have, but
I'd prefer not to go there.

19:34.304 --> 19:36.130
Works for me.
Get the password?

19:36.173 --> 19:38.826
I did. I used a
smudge attack.

19:38.869 --> 19:41.000
Smudge?
Attack, yeah.

19:41.043 --> 19:43.695
It's deceptively simple.

19:43.739 --> 19:46.565
Every time a cell phone user
enters their password,

19:46.608 --> 19:49.043
they leave a smudge
on each button-press.

19:49.086 --> 19:51.086
It's virtually
undetectable.

19:51.130 --> 19:54.956
But if you photograph it
at exactly the right angle,

19:55.000 --> 19:56.913
and then you jack up

19:56.956 --> 19:59.434
the contrast,
you get a pattern,

19:59.478 --> 20:01.391
and with that, you can

20:01.434 --> 20:03.826
deduce the password,
which I did.

20:03.869 --> 20:05.260
Are you impressed?

20:05.304 --> 20:06.608
Every time.

20:06.652 --> 20:10.130
Unfortunately, there's not
that much on the cell.

20:10.173 --> 20:11.652
There's no address book.

20:11.695 --> 20:13.130
It's an unregistered phone.

20:13.173 --> 20:15.782
All the calls went
to another unregistered number.

20:15.826 --> 20:19.608
The only thing I did find
were surveillance photos.

20:19.652 --> 20:20.260
PFC Hill?

20:20.304 --> 20:21.260
No.

20:21.304 --> 20:22.956
[computer chirping]

20:23.000 --> 20:24.173
His sister.

20:24.217 --> 20:26.565
Lindsey.

20:26.608 --> 20:29.434
[computer chirping]

20:29.478 --> 20:33.086
Gibbs, I just
don't think that Hill

20:33.130 --> 20:35.869
was the kidnapper's target.

20:35.913 --> 20:38.608
No.

20:38.652 --> 20:40.652
Me, neither.

20:48.434 --> 20:51.695
AMANDA:
Oh, my God,
you were being followed?

20:51.739 --> 20:54.913
Are you sure these belong
to Tommy's killer?

20:54.956 --> 20:57.304
Found these
on his cell phone.

20:57.347 --> 21:00.217
So you think it was me
he wanted to...?

21:00.260 --> 21:01.695
ZIVA:
We believe you were

21:01.739 --> 21:03.521
the target, yes,
but we also believe

21:03.565 --> 21:06.304
that the intent was
kidnapping and not murder.

21:06.347 --> 21:07.782
My son is dead.

21:07.826 --> 21:10.217
Most likely because
he attempted to intervene.

21:11.956 --> 21:13.956
Tommy was trying to protect me?

21:15.521 --> 21:17.782
So it is all my fault.

21:17.826 --> 21:21.260
I don't think PFC Hill
would see it that way.

21:21.304 --> 21:23.347
Why would anybody want
to kidnap our girl?

21:23.391 --> 21:24.956
We don't have any money.

21:26.739 --> 21:28.043
What's with the eyeballs?

21:28.086 --> 21:29.869
Well, our records
indicate that you made

21:29.913 --> 21:32.869
a sizable payment to your bank
to prevent foreclosure.

21:32.913 --> 21:34.347
Well, you got
your records wrong.

21:34.391 --> 21:37.913
Yeah, we were looking at
foreclosure a few months back.

21:37.956 --> 21:41.130
But then the bank sent
us a letter saying they
were reducing our mortgage.

21:42.565 --> 21:44.173
We're getting your foster
records, but we'd

21:44.217 --> 21:46.043
rather hear the
story from you.

21:46.086 --> 21:49.826
ZIVA:
It may help us find
whoever took these pictures.

21:49.869 --> 21:52.130
LINDSEY:
Yeah. Um...

21:54.173 --> 21:55.826
My birth parents,

21:55.869 --> 21:59.347
they lived with this commune
in Pennsylvania.

21:59.391 --> 22:04.782
They were against technology,
stuff like that.

22:04.826 --> 22:06.217
We moved around a lot.

22:06.260 --> 22:10.826
I got, uh, beat up a lot.

22:10.869 --> 22:12.739
By other kids?

22:12.782 --> 22:16.173
No. My parents.

22:16.217 --> 22:20.130
One day, I had enough
and took off.

22:20.173 --> 22:22.739
Social Services
picked her up.

22:22.782 --> 22:24.260
She ended up with us.

22:24.304 --> 22:26.869
Where are
your birth parents now?

22:26.913 --> 22:29.434
I don't know.

22:32.434 --> 22:35.043
But what if it's them?
What if they want me back?

22:35.086 --> 22:37.826
They can try.

22:37.869 --> 22:40.391
We won't let anything
happen to you.

22:40.434 --> 22:42.478
[murmurs]

22:42.521 --> 22:43.739
ZIVA:
There is very little

22:43.782 --> 22:45.434
on Lindsey's biological
parents in her file.

22:45.478 --> 22:48.043
If they're off the grid, they're
gonna be pretty hard to find.

22:48.086 --> 22:49.782
No cell phone, no car...

22:49.826 --> 22:51.347
Who doesn't
like technology?

22:51.391 --> 22:53.739
Plague-surviving mutants.

22:53.782 --> 22:56.695
You ever see Omega Man?
1971, Charlton H...

22:56.739 --> 22:58.043
Keep it helpful.

22:58.086 --> 22:59.130
Concussion. Okay.

22:59.173 --> 23:00.956
I think we're missing
the big picture.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.217
What's that?

23:02.260 --> 23:05.173
The dead guy buried
50 grand in the forest.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.956
Yes, but the killer was
targeting his foster sister.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.043
Yes! But do I have to
do all the heavy lifting?

23:11.086 --> 23:12.652
Yes, lift.

23:12.695 --> 23:14.695
Private Hill was in business
with Curtis. Something illegal.

23:14.739 --> 23:17.782
The Goody Two-shoes routine
was obviously a cover.

23:17.826 --> 23:19.782
So, what happened next
is what always happens next.

23:19.826 --> 23:21.826
The private got greedy.

23:21.869 --> 23:25.130
Took more than his fair share,
buried it in the ground.

23:25.173 --> 23:26.565
Hill wouldn't say where,

23:26.608 --> 23:29.347
and Curtis couldn't
go to the police.

23:29.391 --> 23:31.478
So he tried to grab
Lindsey as leverage.Nice assist.

23:31.521 --> 23:33.869
Either way, Lindsey
could still be in danger.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.434
DiNozzo, track down
that commune.

23:35.478 --> 23:36.826
McGee, you got Curtis.

23:36.869 --> 23:38.956
Ziva, I want a copy
of that bank letter.

23:41.130 --> 23:43.086
TONY:
Where you going, boss?I got first shift.

23:43.130 --> 23:45.043
I want eyes on Lindsey
around the clock.

23:45.086 --> 23:46.739
Tony?

23:53.304 --> 23:56.565
I think I found
your friend, Stinky John.

23:56.608 --> 23:58.739
I was able to use your
description of a
mole on his chin.

23:58.782 --> 24:01.130
Yeah.Traced him to
a clinical trial

24:01.173 --> 24:04.304
for basal cell
carcinoma treatment.

24:04.347 --> 24:07.260
Oh, my God, he's got cancer.

24:07.304 --> 24:08.521
Oh, no, no.
Don't worry about it.

24:08.565 --> 24:10.043
He's fine.
They were able to treat it.

24:10.086 --> 24:13.478
But he is getting on a plane
to leave the country tomorrow.

24:13.521 --> 24:16.782
So, if you want to see him,
you'd better hurry.

24:16.826 --> 24:19.869
Okay. Thanks.

24:32.869 --> 24:34.086
Hi.

24:34.130 --> 24:35.956
Thought you might
want some coffee.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.043
Thanks.

24:38.086 --> 24:39.913
You should be in bed.

24:39.956 --> 24:43.000
Oh, yeah, well,
my bed's kind of crowded.

24:43.043 --> 24:46.869
My mom insisted on
sleeping with me.

24:48.782 --> 24:51.652
She's worried about you.

24:53.347 --> 24:55.608
They're not like the others.

24:55.652 --> 24:58.434
My real parents.

24:58.478 --> 25:01.913
And they're not like
those people who take

25:01.956 --> 25:04.695
as many foster kids as they
can get 'cause they get paid.

25:04.739 --> 25:07.956
They really care.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.478
Yeah, I know.

25:10.521 --> 25:12.521
Five iron tipped me off.

25:12.565 --> 25:14.782
[giggles]

25:21.695 --> 25:23.826
[sighs]

25:23.869 --> 25:26.347
Biggest thing I had to worry
about before this week

25:26.391 --> 25:28.521
was what I'm gonna do
after graduation.

25:28.565 --> 25:31.043
Hmm.

25:31.086 --> 25:34.173
And what is that?

25:34.217 --> 25:38.173
I'm sure the wrong thing.

25:38.217 --> 25:40.000
[nearby clatter]

25:55.782 --> 25:57.739
[grunting]

25:57.782 --> 25:58.869
Ow!

25:58.913 --> 26:00.652
Take it easy! Geez!

26:00.695 --> 26:02.434
Nathan, what are you doing?

26:02.478 --> 26:04.739
I just came to see
if you were okay.

26:04.782 --> 26:08.478
Yeah, and I was gonna swat a
fly off the end of your nose.

26:08.521 --> 26:09.869
Call his parents.

26:10.956 --> 26:13.347
Nathan, you could
get hurt.

26:13.391 --> 26:15.304
I know.
And so could you.

26:15.347 --> 26:16.782
And that's why I'm here.

26:16.826 --> 26:18.478
So am I.

26:18.521 --> 26:21.695
Right. And I appreciate
the assistance, Agent Gibbs.

26:21.739 --> 26:23.869
In fact, if there's
anything I can d...

26:23.913 --> 26:26.043
Hey...

26:26.086 --> 26:28.434
Wait, is that the guy?

26:29.869 --> 26:32.260
Wait, I-I've seen
that guy before.

26:33.739 --> 26:35.086
Where?

26:35.130 --> 26:36.782
He was lost and
flagged me down

26:36.826 --> 26:38.956
to ask for directions
the other day,

26:39.000 --> 26:40.913
and then looked
like he saw a ghost.

26:40.956 --> 26:42.782
And then he just took off.

26:42.826 --> 26:45.217
It was so weird.[cell phone rings]

26:45.260 --> 26:46.739
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

26:46.782 --> 26:48.304
Hey, boss.
Sorry to bother you.

26:48.347 --> 26:50.217
I've been pulling an all-
nighter, and I've been trying

26:50.260 --> 26:52.347
to find that commune,
but I guess it's moot now.

26:52.391 --> 26:53.956
The guy who owns the taco place
just called,

26:54.000 --> 26:55.391
said Curtis Beane showed up.

27:00.086 --> 27:02.086
[tires screech]

27:08.521 --> 27:09.869
Where is he?

27:09.913 --> 27:11.695
He's up on the roof.
He's talking crazy.

27:11.739 --> 27:13.826
DiNozzo.

27:13.869 --> 27:16.565
Hey, he-he just keeps saying
how he's not going back to jail.

27:16.608 --> 27:18.043
That's never a good sign.

27:18.086 --> 27:20.565
You-you promised you were going
to bring Curtis in safe,

27:20.608 --> 27:22.043
prove him innocent.

27:22.086 --> 27:25.217
Yeah, well, I can bring him in.

27:25.260 --> 27:27.869
That second part's not up to me.

27:31.869 --> 27:33.956
GIBBS:
Curtis! NCIS!

27:34.000 --> 27:36.391
Get your hands in the air!

27:42.217 --> 27:43.565
Get away from the ledge!

27:44.826 --> 27:46.652
Your boss thinks
you were set up.

27:46.695 --> 27:48.869
If that's true,
we can help.

27:59.043 --> 28:01.521
GIBBS:
Don't do it!

28:03.652 --> 28:04.695
He's going over!

28:12.173 --> 28:14.173
McGEE:
Boss...

28:14.217 --> 28:15.173
He was right.

28:15.217 --> 28:17.260
He's not going
back to prison.

28:21.347 --> 28:23.695
I thought for sure
he was going over the edge.

28:23.739 --> 28:25.869
Well, lucky for me, he didn't.
You dug that hole.

28:25.913 --> 28:28.652
Would've been my turn to go
through his pockets.

28:28.695 --> 28:32.347
So was the death accidental
or deliberate?Waiting for Ducky's report.

28:32.391 --> 28:34.695
With the number of track marks
in his arm, it's amazing

28:34.739 --> 28:36.652
he didn't kill himself
a month ago.

28:36.695 --> 28:38.956
But we're pretty sure
he killed Private Hill.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.739
He had the murder weapon on him.
Open and shut case.

28:41.782 --> 28:43.260
Really? Open and shut, huh?

28:43.304 --> 28:45.478
And all this time, I'm here
thinking we needed motive?

28:45.521 --> 28:49.217
Gibbs, I may have found
something helpful.

28:51.173 --> 28:53.695
This is a copy of the bank
letter the McCormicks received,

28:53.739 --> 28:56.347
informing them their mortgage
was reduced. However...

28:56.391 --> 28:58.260
it is a forgery.

28:58.304 --> 28:59.826
The bank said
they never sent it.

28:59.869 --> 29:01.782
But you know who did.

29:01.826 --> 29:04.782
I found the original file
on Private Hill's computer.

29:04.826 --> 29:06.565
So, he paid the bill,
then forged the letter

29:06.608 --> 29:08.565
so he didn't have to explain
where the cash came from?

29:08.608 --> 29:10.391
No, I do not think Hill sent it.

29:10.434 --> 29:12.826
The file was last modified
while he was deployed,

29:12.869 --> 29:15.739
but the computer
never left the state.

29:15.782 --> 29:17.956
Doesn't leave us
a lot of options.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.521
Well, let me pick one for you.

29:19.565 --> 29:22.608
I just finished running
Lindsey's DNA.

29:22.652 --> 29:24.173
And?

29:24.217 --> 29:26.652
And it matches the blood
from the second syringe

29:26.695 --> 29:28.130
that Ziva found
at the crime scene.

29:28.173 --> 29:29.652
She was there.
McGEE:
Lindsey?

29:29.695 --> 29:31.391
When her foster brother
was murdered,

29:31.434 --> 29:32.869
and she didn't say anything?

29:32.913 --> 29:34.434
Oh, tip. Iceberg.

29:34.478 --> 29:36.695
Per your request,
I also ran a DNA test

29:36.739 --> 29:39.130
that can ballpark
a person's age range.

29:39.173 --> 29:42.260
You were right, Gibbs.
Her coffee was too good.

29:42.304 --> 29:46.826
It has a pretty wide margin
of error, but according to

29:46.869 --> 29:50.869
the telomeres of her DNA,
Lindsey is not 17.

29:50.913 --> 29:52.826
She's 27.

30:01.434 --> 30:03.217
Gibbs!

30:03.260 --> 30:06.913
We widened the range of our
background search and got a hit.

30:06.956 --> 30:08.652
Her real name isn't Lindsey,
it's Roxanne.

30:08.695 --> 30:12.521
And she didn't run away from a
commune two years ago, either.

30:12.565 --> 30:14.913
She was living with a foster
family in Maryland.

30:14.956 --> 30:16.478
She said she was 16.

30:16.521 --> 30:19.304
Spent a few years in the local
high school,

30:19.347 --> 30:21.478
then ran away just
before her 18th birthday.

30:21.521 --> 30:23.043
I got a hit.

30:23.086 --> 30:25.304
Her real name isn't Lindsey.

30:25.347 --> 30:27.130
It's Daisy.

30:32.173 --> 30:33.347
I found almost
the same thing.

30:33.391 --> 30:35.217
Five years ago,
she called herself Daisy.

30:35.260 --> 30:37.478
Moved in with a foster
family in Pennsylvania.

30:37.521 --> 30:38.826
Said she was 16?Yeah.

30:38.869 --> 30:40.521
Spent two years
in high school.

30:40.565 --> 30:42.304
Ran away just before
her 18th birthday.

30:42.347 --> 30:44.347
She's been living a lie
this whole time.

30:44.391 --> 30:46.913
ZIVA:
It is some kind of con, huh?

30:46.956 --> 30:49.260
And maybe Private Hill got
suspicious. He was poking around

30:49.304 --> 30:51.913
Virginia's Social Services
database before he was killed.

30:51.956 --> 30:53.826
Lindsey could've hired
someone to take him out

30:53.869 --> 30:55.608
before he found anything
incriminating.

30:55.652 --> 30:57.478
Pick her up.

30:57.521 --> 30:59.173
Okay.

30:59.217 --> 31:01.956
Hey, guys, um, we ought
to take two cars.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.739
I may... make a little pit stop
on my way back. Thanks.

31:10.956 --> 31:13.391
"With my deepest
apologies..."

31:29.130 --> 31:30.869
[sighs]

31:30.913 --> 31:33.173
This seemed like a much better
idea in the shower.

31:34.913 --> 31:37.217
John...

31:44.086 --> 31:46.869
Ah, somebody's
had a growth spurt.

31:46.913 --> 31:48.391
Oh...

31:49.913 --> 31:51.608
That's better.

31:51.652 --> 31:55.086
You may not remember me...

31:55.130 --> 31:56.608
DiNozzo?

31:56.652 --> 31:58.130
Yeah.Tony DiNozzo?

31:58.173 --> 31:59.347
Yeah.

31:59.391 --> 32:02.652
Yeah, man! Yeah.
How you doing, buddy?

32:02.695 --> 32:04.391
Good to see you.
How are you?

32:04.434 --> 32:06.217
John, uh, listen, I got...

32:06.260 --> 32:09.000
I... I just uh...

32:09.043 --> 32:11.043
I know this is gonna
sound a little crazy,

32:11.086 --> 32:13.608
'cause it's ancient history
and, uh...

32:13.652 --> 32:16.086
I just wanted...

32:16.130 --> 32:19.086
to, uh...

32:19.130 --> 32:22.304
say I'm sorry for what happened
when we were...

32:22.347 --> 32:24.434
in boarding school, because...

32:24.478 --> 32:27.826
you know, it was... it was
inappropriate and, uh...

32:27.869 --> 32:29.130
Well, anything
involving flagpoles

32:29.173 --> 32:30.695
and-and, uh... and underwear.

32:30.739 --> 32:33.608
Wait. Wait,
wait a second.

32:33.652 --> 32:36.521
You're sorry?

32:36.565 --> 32:38.565
Yeah.

32:39.565 --> 32:41.521
Better late than never, right?

32:41.565 --> 32:44.782
Uh... yeah.

32:44.826 --> 32:46.869
Yeah, but I just, I...

32:46.913 --> 32:49.304
not real sure why
you're the one who's sorry.

32:56.086 --> 32:58.086
[door opens]

33:01.173 --> 33:03.130
[sighs]

33:03.173 --> 33:07.130
Uh, your agents said
you wanted to talk to me?

33:08.173 --> 33:10.304
Yeah.

33:10.347 --> 33:13.304
Just not sure
what I should call you.

33:13.347 --> 33:17.217
I don't understand.

33:20.521 --> 33:22.478
It's you,

33:22.521 --> 33:26.086
two years ago, a
senior in high school.

33:28.130 --> 33:30.304
This is you,

33:30.347 --> 33:32.304
five years ago.

33:32.347 --> 33:34.086
Senior in high school.

33:34.130 --> 33:37.695
Each time, the same face.

33:38.739 --> 33:41.347
Just different names.

33:41.391 --> 33:44.130
My name is Lindsey.

33:44.173 --> 33:46.130
Yeah, well,

33:46.173 --> 33:48.173
Lindsey...

33:51.434 --> 33:53.521
...we found your DNA
at the crime scene

33:53.565 --> 33:55.695
where Private Hill
was murdered.

33:55.739 --> 33:58.869
Don't my foster parents have
to be here when you question me?

33:58.913 --> 34:01.652
If you were actually 17,
yeah, mm-hmm.

34:01.695 --> 34:04.913
I am 17.

34:04.956 --> 34:08.695
Yeah, and I'm about
to charge you with murder.

34:08.739 --> 34:10.739
Why did you lie to us?

34:12.695 --> 34:15.478
That money that was buried--
it didn't belong to PFC Hill.

34:15.521 --> 34:19.521
It belonged to you from whatever
con you've been running.

34:21.260 --> 34:23.956
All right, stand up.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.565
Wait. No, I-I was...

34:25.608 --> 34:28.043
I was waiting to meet Tommy
for the party,

34:28.086 --> 34:29.173
like I said, and then,

34:29.217 --> 34:32.608
suddenly, this guy appeared.

34:32.652 --> 34:35.260
He stuck me with something.

34:35.304 --> 34:38.260
The last thing I remember is
Tommy grabbing me

34:38.304 --> 34:40.086
and telling me to run.

34:40.130 --> 34:41.434
I guess I did.

34:41.478 --> 34:44.434
I... I woke up in a field
a half an hour later.

34:55.304 --> 34:58.217
Why didn't you say something
about the attack?

35:00.217 --> 35:02.173
I don't know.

35:02.217 --> 35:04.260
I guess I was scared?

35:04.304 --> 35:07.521
Of what, that we'd find out
about these?

35:08.565 --> 35:10.260
No, there's nothing to find out.

35:11.478 --> 35:13.173
They're obviously fake.

35:13.217 --> 35:16.130
They don't look
like they're fakes to me.

35:16.173 --> 35:19.391
Well, look, I've...

35:19.434 --> 35:22.782
never seen these photos
before in my life.

35:26.521 --> 35:29.347
So, Duck,
she crazy or not?

35:29.391 --> 35:33.000
Crazy is not
a technical diagnosis.

35:33.043 --> 35:34.695
I'm not a technical guy, Duck.

35:34.739 --> 35:36.173
Well, the short answer is no.

35:36.217 --> 35:40.217
I'm convinced
that this woman believes

35:40.260 --> 35:42.826
she is a 17-year-old
girl named Lindsey.

35:42.869 --> 35:44.695
That's pretty nuts.

35:44.739 --> 35:48.130
Belief is the currency of
the delusionist, Jethro,

35:48.173 --> 35:50.173
not the mentally ill.

35:50.217 --> 35:53.130
Yeah, the difference here is
that part of her does know

35:53.173 --> 35:54.260
the truth.

35:54.304 --> 35:55.913
Here's the forged
bank letter,

35:55.956 --> 35:58.260
reducing the
McCormick's mortgage.

35:58.304 --> 36:00.956
The signature is in
Lindsey's handwriting.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.478
So, she's the one
who paid off the bank.And then

36:03.521 --> 36:05.347
tried to deny the fact.

36:05.391 --> 36:09.347
Such manipulation requires a...
well, a considerable awareness

36:09.391 --> 36:11.086
of her real identity.

36:11.130 --> 36:12.739
It's a lot of cash.

36:12.782 --> 36:15.130
Yeah, the source of which
is a mystery.

36:15.173 --> 36:16.608
You don't think this is a con?

36:16.652 --> 36:18.608
Jethro, this is not
about the money.

36:18.652 --> 36:20.391
Look at the pattern.

36:20.434 --> 36:23.956
She's been in three foster
families before her current one.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.782
Stolen from
none of them.

36:25.826 --> 36:28.304
But then, just
before she turns

36:28.347 --> 36:30.695
18, she runs away,

36:30.739 --> 36:32.826
lies her way
into another foster home,

36:32.869 --> 36:36.608
and enjoys a few carefree years
as a high-schooler.

36:36.652 --> 36:40.000
Then, just before
she has to turn 18 again...

36:40.043 --> 36:41.869
She runs away,
she starts all over.

36:41.913 --> 36:44.304
Everyone has
their addiction, Jethro.

36:44.347 --> 36:46.000
This woman's is childhood.

36:46.043 --> 36:48.391
She covets an adolescence
that was taken from her.

36:48.434 --> 36:50.217
Taken?

36:50.260 --> 36:51.565
And quite violently.

36:51.608 --> 36:53.826
That story about
the Pennsylvania commune

36:53.869 --> 36:57.086
is clearly a fabrication,
but based in fact.

36:57.130 --> 36:59.782
This is her medical file.

36:59.826 --> 37:04.869
Her body is covered in old scars
from multiple beatings.

37:04.913 --> 37:07.043
With such childhood trauma,

37:07.086 --> 37:11.000
it's no wonder that she has
chosen to deny her past,

37:11.043 --> 37:13.000
and if it continues
to threaten her,

37:13.043 --> 37:16.173
then I don't think she's even
capable of acknowledging it.

37:16.217 --> 37:18.869
Sadly, it might have been
different in her new home.

37:18.913 --> 37:20.695
Who knows?

37:20.739 --> 37:24.347
She might even have turned 18
this time.

37:24.391 --> 37:26.434
[indistinct,
overlapping shouting]

37:32.173 --> 37:35.521
Agent Gibbs, here
to take me up on that offer

37:35.565 --> 37:37.043
for the free chili con carne?

37:37.086 --> 37:40.217
No. Wanted you to take
another look at this photo.

37:41.782 --> 37:43.739
You sure it doesn't
look familiar?

37:43.782 --> 37:45.173
Like I said last time, no.

37:45.217 --> 37:47.173
No, I never seen that guy
before.

37:47.217 --> 37:49.347
What about the girl?

37:52.739 --> 37:55.260
No. Sorry.

37:55.304 --> 37:56.869
Really?

37:56.913 --> 37:59.130
Because state records indicate
that she is your niece.

37:59.173 --> 38:02.260
And you got custody of her
after her parents died

38:02.304 --> 38:05.000
in a car crash
when she was 11.

38:07.956 --> 38:09.130
[gasps]

38:09.173 --> 38:11.521
[McGee shouts]

38:11.565 --> 38:12.956
It wasn't me!

38:13.000 --> 38:14.869
It was Curtis!

38:14.913 --> 38:16.956
She ran away years ago,

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
took a boatload of
his cash with her.

38:20.043 --> 38:22.304
And last week,
he runs into her, total fluke.

38:22.347 --> 38:24.434
He just wanted
his money back.
TONY:
Oh, come on.

38:24.478 --> 38:26.608
Blaming it on the dead guy--
that's a dead giveaway.

38:26.652 --> 38:28.869
Where'd a guy like Curtis
get 50 grand?

38:28.913 --> 38:30.391
From the ex-cons I hired.

38:30.434 --> 38:34.043
They used the deliveries
that Curtis assigned them

38:34.086 --> 38:35.608
as cover to stake out
people's houses.

38:35.652 --> 38:38.173
Then they cut Curtis in on
some of the money they stole.

38:38.217 --> 38:41.217
Really? We spoke to a
few of your employees.

38:41.260 --> 38:43.304
And they said
you were the one in charge,

38:43.347 --> 38:44.739
and the money was yours.

38:44.782 --> 38:46.826
They're lying.

38:46.869 --> 38:49.130
Let go!
McGee, let him go.

38:49.173 --> 38:50.304
[sighs]

38:50.347 --> 38:53.086
You want to make a run for it,
go, go.

38:53.130 --> 38:56.000
Go on, get out of here, do it.

38:56.043 --> 38:57.739
You got a gun.

38:57.782 --> 38:59.217
What do I got?

39:04.347 --> 39:06.913
What am I supposed
to do with this?

39:06.956 --> 39:09.434
Oh, I'm sorry.

39:09.478 --> 39:11.695
That's right.

39:11.739 --> 39:13.956
You only use that
on little girls.

39:30.043 --> 39:32.086
TONY:
You got about a half hour

39:32.130 --> 39:34.956
to get your stuff. We need to be
at the hospital by 2:00.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.434
Yeah.

39:37.478 --> 39:40.826
Wouldn't want
to miss my commitment hearing.

39:40.869 --> 39:43.782
It's just an evaluation.

39:43.826 --> 39:47.130
I'm... I'm not crazy.

39:54.130 --> 39:56.304
Can you guys just get my stuff?

39:56.347 --> 39:59.086
They asked to see you.

39:59.130 --> 40:01.217
I don't want to see them.

40:01.260 --> 40:03.695
You know, I don't
need my things.

40:03.739 --> 40:05.130
Let's... let's just go.

40:05.173 --> 40:08.826
You said that you've always
done the wrong thing?

40:08.869 --> 40:11.782
Well, here's your chance
to do the right thing.

40:36.695 --> 40:38.695
We opened our home to you

40:38.739 --> 40:40.565
because we thought
you were in trouble.

40:42.130 --> 40:45.000
I'm so sorry.

40:46.782 --> 40:51.086
Well... as far as
we're concerned...

40:51.130 --> 40:53.130
nothing's changed.

40:55.173 --> 40:58.173
Sweetie.

40:58.217 --> 41:00.043
It's gonna be okay, honey.

41:00.086 --> 41:02.086
Let's go.

41:05.217 --> 41:07.434
Wish my own apology
went that well.

41:09.478 --> 41:12.173
Uh, there was this...

41:12.217 --> 41:14.434
It was nothing,
but I-I had this, uh...

41:19.565 --> 41:21.521
Nothing.

41:21.565 --> 41:23.173
I know.

41:24.217 --> 41:26.434
What happened?

41:30.652 --> 41:32.652
I wrote an apology card.

41:32.695 --> 41:34.739
That's not a good idea.

41:34.782 --> 41:37.652
Rule number six--
never say you're sorry.

41:37.695 --> 41:38.913
[sighs]

41:38.956 --> 41:40.521
Let's just say

41:40.565 --> 41:43.086
Lindsey wasn't the only one
reinventing her past.

41:43.130 --> 41:48.260
Apparently, I didn't
string Stinky John up

41:48.304 --> 41:49.782
by his tighty whities
on the flagpole.

41:49.826 --> 41:51.086
He strung meup.

41:51.130 --> 41:54.652
Which is weird.
Really weird.

41:54.695 --> 41:56.304
Because I...

41:56.347 --> 41:59.217
I've been telling that story
for a long time, and...

42:00.043 --> 42:03.000
...I don't when I...
flip-flopped it.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.826
But I guess...

42:06.869 --> 42:09.391
I don't know, maybe I was
trying to protect myself,

42:09.434 --> 42:11.521
or make things...

42:11.565 --> 42:14.217
