00:32.360 --> 00:34.200
For goodness sake,

00:34.200 --> 00:36.040
if you know that
I'm always going to be late,

00:36.040 --> 00:38.800
it would be polite
for you to be late, too.

00:38.800 --> 00:40.800
- Just saying.
- Why are you breathing weird?

00:40.800 --> 00:43.480
Because I ran here.
And you're the light of my life

00:45.640 --> 00:48.200
Oh, God. What's wrong?

00:48.200 --> 00:50.320
No, I'm not taking that
till you tell me what's wrong.

00:50.320 --> 00:51.960
This is what's wrong.

00:54.160 --> 00:56.640
Kidnap and murder victim,
Marcus Farrow.

00:56.640 --> 00:59.640
28. Entrepreneur,
outdoor adventurer.

00:59.640 --> 01:02.800
Owner of Uncharted Tours,
based out west.

01:02.800 --> 01:06.280
He specialized in high venture
tourism for wealthy clients

01:06.280 --> 01:08.320
wanting a boutique
wilderness experience.

01:08.320 --> 01:10.120
Oh, yeah,
I've seen the ads.

01:10.120 --> 01:12.680
The cause of death was
blunt-force trauma to the head.

01:12.680 --> 01:14.080
We found a brick
next to the body.

01:14.080 --> 01:15.840
No prints.

01:15.840 --> 01:19.520
Police have arrested this man.

01:19.520 --> 01:21.280
Jared O'Loughlin.

01:21.280 --> 01:22.800
Jared worked for Marcus

01:22.800 --> 01:25.520
and was at his house
the morning Marcus went missing.

01:27.520 --> 01:30.560
That night, Marcus's brother
Connor got a ransom call

01:30.560 --> 01:32.800
- demanding 100
- K cash...

01:35.560 --> 01:37.520
And Jared's voice was on
the other end of the line?

01:37.520 --> 01:40.520
Brother thinks so.

01:40.520 --> 01:44.880
They found the body in
Jared's garage three days later.

01:46.400 --> 01:49.240
They're gonna charge Jared
with first-degree murder.

01:49.240 --> 01:53.520
Why do I get the feeling
this is personal?

01:53.520 --> 01:56.360
Oh, you know this kid.

01:56.360 --> 01:59.120
Yeah, I've been mentoring him
in a rehabilitation program

01:59.120 --> 02:02.360
for young offenders.

02:02.360 --> 02:03.880
He's a good kid.

02:03.880 --> 02:06.040
He's turning his life around.

02:06.040 --> 02:07.680
"Is"? Or "was"?

02:12.480 --> 02:15.520
Does Jared have an alibi?
Motive?

02:15.520 --> 02:18.360
Money. He was angry about
not being paid.

02:18.360 --> 02:20.320
Why aren't you doing
the digging on this?

02:20.320 --> 02:23.000
Not my case.
Conflict of interest.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.040
You pick.

02:25.040 --> 02:27.080
You want me to
find him innocent.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.720
I want you to find the truth.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.200
Well, I assume that you traced
the ransom call?

02:36.200 --> 02:37.520
It was made
from a phone belonging

02:37.520 --> 02:39.040
to the victim's fiancée.

02:39.040 --> 02:41.400
The fiancée?

02:41.400 --> 02:43.320
She says it was stolen
from the house.

03:03.480 --> 03:06.320
We're very sorry for your loss.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.480
The first night, after,
I kept thinking about

03:08.480 --> 03:12.960
all the time I wasted that day.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.800
Thinking about stupid things --

03:15.800 --> 03:19.160
clients,

03:19.160 --> 03:21.840
work, dinner,

03:21.840 --> 03:23.680
macros.

03:25.920 --> 03:28.520
I didn't think about him.

03:28.520 --> 03:29.920
All those wasted hours.

03:29.920 --> 03:33.920
I didn't think about him once.

03:33.920 --> 03:36.360
Sugar?

03:36.360 --> 03:38.000
No.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.360
Look, it would be really helpful

03:39.360 --> 03:41.320
if we could just start
at the beginning.

03:41.320 --> 03:43.960
In your statement,
you said that you let Jared

03:43.960 --> 03:45.840
into the house that morning.

03:45.840 --> 03:47.840
I...

03:47.840 --> 03:49.520
Yeah.

03:49.520 --> 03:52.120
I was running late for a session
with a client at 10:30.

03:52.120 --> 03:53.600
I was...

03:53.600 --> 03:56.920
I was distracted,
running around, um...

03:56.920 --> 03:58.600
What time did Jared show up?

03:58.600 --> 04:01.160
10 past, 10:15.

04:03.160 --> 04:06.320
He just went straight
for Marcus, didn't even say hi.

04:06.320 --> 04:08.920
He just went straight
into how --

04:08.920 --> 04:11.720
how he hadn't been paid yet,
how he needed money.

04:11.720 --> 04:13.240
Did it get physical?

04:13.240 --> 04:15.440
He's scary when he's mad.

04:15.440 --> 04:17.520
So he didn't get physical?

04:17.520 --> 04:19.040
Well, he didn't have to.
He just --

04:19.040 --> 04:21.640
He went on and on like...

04:21.640 --> 04:23.400
It was --
It was like I wasn't even there.

04:23.400 --> 04:27.640
And then I turn my back for
one minute, he took my phone.

04:27.640 --> 04:30.120
You saw him take your phone?

04:30.120 --> 04:33.440
No, but...

04:33.440 --> 04:35.560
I mean, who else could it be?

04:35.560 --> 04:38.320
Where was the last place
you remember seeing your phone?

04:38.320 --> 04:40.600
I put it down when I let him in.

04:40.600 --> 04:44.360
On the table just by the door.

04:44.360 --> 04:46.440
And I went to my bedroom.

04:46.440 --> 04:48.320
I got...

04:48.320 --> 04:51.520
my bag and I came back
and it was gone.

04:51.520 --> 04:52.840
He was the only one here.

04:52.840 --> 04:55.160
And did you look for it?

04:55.160 --> 04:57.760
I ran Find My Phone
on my laptop, it --

04:57.760 --> 04:59.120
It said it was in the house.

04:59.120 --> 05:01.120
I was --

05:01.120 --> 05:03.200
I was running late,
so I-I left it.

05:03.200 --> 05:06.720
So, you got to the gym
at 10:30 AM?

05:06.720 --> 05:09.840
Barely just made it.

05:09.840 --> 05:12.520
Are you looking for an alibi?

05:12.520 --> 05:16.600
I'm just trying to get
the details straight.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.920
Powerlifter at 10:30.

05:18.920 --> 05:22.360
Two one-hour sessions
back to back brings me to 12:30,

05:22.360 --> 05:23.760
when I had lunch with a friend.

05:23.760 --> 05:27.880
Then I taught two group classes,
got home at 3:30.

05:27.880 --> 05:31.240
When you realized
that Marcus wasn't here.

05:31.240 --> 05:32.680
Not immediately.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.520
I assumed that he was at work.

05:35.520 --> 05:38.520
Oh, but his car was still
at the house.

05:38.520 --> 05:40.280
In the garage.
I didn't look in the garage.

05:40.280 --> 05:43.560
- Why would I?
- Oh, right.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.960
Your statement says that
you called Marcus's brother

05:45.960 --> 05:49.480
at 6:00 PM when you notice
that Marcus still wasn't home.

05:49.480 --> 05:54.160
Well, how did you do that
if your phone was missing?

05:54.160 --> 05:56.960
What are you trying to do?

05:56.960 --> 06:01.000
My fiancé was just found dead
in the garage

06:01.000 --> 06:04.440
of a violent ex-con.

06:04.440 --> 06:07.360
Jared has only been convicted of
crimes against property,

06:07.360 --> 06:09.160
- not people.
- Oh. Are you -- are you --

06:09.160 --> 06:10.760
are you saying
that he didn't do it?

06:10.760 --> 06:12.720
No, I don't know who did it.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.640
Just that it's not in keeping
with his record.

06:14.640 --> 06:15.840
Well, you wouldn't
be saying that

06:15.840 --> 06:18.280
if you saw him that morning.

06:18.280 --> 06:21.240
And you haven't answered
my question.

06:21.240 --> 06:24.240
About calling Marcus' brother
when your phone was missing.

06:25.720 --> 06:27.760
The landline.

06:27.760 --> 06:29.920
I called him from the landline.

06:29.920 --> 06:31.520
Thank you.

06:31.520 --> 06:33.440
For the tea.

06:36.200 --> 06:38.000
Oh...

06:38.000 --> 06:40.640
Marcus had life insurance,
didn't he?

06:40.640 --> 06:43.960
Like $1 million worth?

06:43.960 --> 06:48.160
I only found out he had life
insurance after he was killed.

06:48.160 --> 06:49.920
Gotcha.

06:58.600 --> 07:01.520
10:15,
Jared shows up at the house.

07:01.520 --> 07:03.480
Two minutes later,
Dennie's phone disappears,

07:03.480 --> 07:06.520
but Find My Phone
places it inside the house.

07:06.520 --> 07:07.760
And six minutes after that,

07:07.760 --> 07:10.440
she leaves for the gym
without it.

07:10.440 --> 07:12.560
- Mm-hmm.
- You don't believe her?

07:12.560 --> 07:13.840
Well, I believe her
about the gym

07:13.840 --> 07:15.760
'cause like 40 people
saw her there.

07:15.760 --> 07:19.720
But the phone stuff --
not so sure.

07:19.720 --> 07:21.360
Well, the timeline checks out.

07:21.360 --> 07:23.120
I mean if Jared showed up
at 10:15 --

07:23.120 --> 07:25.840
The file shows that the phone
was switched off

07:25.840 --> 07:27.520
while Dennie was at home.

07:27.520 --> 07:29.240
So, yeah --
it could've been Jared

07:29.240 --> 07:31.000
who took it and turned it off.
But it could've been Marcus.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.120
It could've been Dennie herself.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.040
To stop her being tracked.

07:35.040 --> 07:37.680
The only person insisting
that Marcus was kidnapped

07:37.680 --> 07:40.880
when Dennie was at the gym
was Dennie.

07:40.880 --> 07:44.680
How much does this case
mean to Harry?

07:44.680 --> 07:46.440
A lot.

07:46.440 --> 07:48.040
Let's visit Unchartered Tours.

07:48.040 --> 07:49.920
I'll talk to Connor.
You talk to the workers.

07:49.920 --> 07:51.560
Okay.

07:55.920 --> 07:58.360
London Business School
Summa Cum Laude.

07:58.360 --> 08:00.160
That's impressive.

08:00.160 --> 08:03.760
Three years and a truck load
of debt, but thank you.

08:03.760 --> 08:05.040
I understand you helped Marcus

08:05.040 --> 08:06.960
get this place
up off the ground?

08:06.960 --> 08:08.360
I herded the cash.

08:08.360 --> 08:11.120
Investors, start up, pitching.

08:11.120 --> 08:15.280
All that nerdy stuff
Marcus hated, that's me.

08:15.280 --> 08:18.600
Well, you seem eminently
qualified for adventure tourism.

08:18.600 --> 08:21.520
Well, I guess
I'm a jack of all trades.

08:21.520 --> 08:25.520
But Marcus -- he was special.

08:25.520 --> 08:27.440
He walks into a room,
everybody lights up.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.560
Everybody orbits.

08:29.560 --> 08:33.520
And then then when
our parents died, he just...

08:33.520 --> 08:35.080
I -- I had to come back.

08:35.080 --> 08:38.240
He wasn't in any shape
to take care of this place,

08:38.240 --> 08:41.920
and if he'd lost it...

08:41.920 --> 08:43.560
You're a good brother.

08:46.320 --> 08:47.960
Not good enough.

08:51.560 --> 08:53.280
Right through this way, guys.

08:53.280 --> 08:55.680
Head on through.

08:55.680 --> 08:56.960
Welcome, welcome.

08:56.960 --> 09:00.440
Oh, just through there
on your left.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.040
Madison Feliciano.

09:02.040 --> 09:04.760
You must be Vincent.

09:04.760 --> 09:06.360
I've already spoken
to the police.

09:06.360 --> 09:07.760
Well, I'm not the police.

09:07.760 --> 09:09.600
I'm with the police
but not the police.

09:09.600 --> 09:12.560
It's a subtle
but significant difference.

09:12.560 --> 09:15.080
I'm sorry for your loss.

09:15.080 --> 09:17.640
So you wanna get to it?

09:17.640 --> 09:20.200
Did you see Marcus
on the day he was killed?

09:20.200 --> 09:22.960
Nah.
Oh, he was meant to come in.

09:22.960 --> 09:25.560
He's a hands-on kinda boss.

09:25.560 --> 09:27.520
He was gonna check out
some new tracks.

09:27.520 --> 09:31.160
Maybe see if we can open up
a new tour next year and expand.

09:31.160 --> 09:32.760
He never showed up.

09:34.920 --> 09:37.360
First timers?

09:37.360 --> 09:39.760
First timers.

09:39.760 --> 09:42.960
You know, after we got the news,
I thought about quitting.

09:42.960 --> 09:45.760
Was gonna head down south,
get some time.

09:45.760 --> 09:48.040
But, ah, then I remembered

09:48.040 --> 09:49.840
Marcus would never
cancel a booking

09:49.840 --> 09:53.240
for anything except bad weather.

09:53.240 --> 09:56.720
You were really close.

09:56.720 --> 09:58.520
Yeah, you can say that.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.920
When did you learn
he was missing?

10:03.920 --> 10:07.440
When Dennie called.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.880
That was after work,
so that would've been...

10:09.880 --> 10:12.200
6:00, 6:30?

10:12.200 --> 10:13.480
She asked if I'd seen him.

10:13.480 --> 10:17.200
I told her I hadn't, and then...

10:17.200 --> 10:19.160
that's when
she started to sound worried.

10:19.160 --> 10:22.480
And she called you
from her landline?

10:22.480 --> 10:25.720
- And the ransom call came...
- A few hours later.

10:25.720 --> 10:27.200
Almost at 9:00.

10:27.200 --> 10:28.760
Where were you?

10:28.760 --> 10:29.800
At home.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.440
With my wife.

10:31.440 --> 10:34.720
We were both here working.

10:34.720 --> 10:36.080
I'm a freelancer.

10:36.080 --> 10:38.000
A lot of my clients
are international,

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
so we're usually
on different schedules.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.880
So you work from home,
and you bring work home.

10:43.880 --> 10:46.040
Just accounting.

10:46.040 --> 10:49.320
When Dennie called to ask
if Marcus was here,

10:49.320 --> 10:51.080
I didn't think anything of it.

10:51.080 --> 10:55.560
And then the ransom call
from Dennie's phone came in.

10:55.560 --> 10:58.240
At 8:53.

10:58.240 --> 11:01.480
I looked at the clock.

11:01.480 --> 11:03.560
Well, tell me
about the ransom call.

11:03.560 --> 11:06.360
It wasn't very long.

11:06.360 --> 11:08.320
Maybe only a minute.

11:08.320 --> 11:10.240
46 seconds.

11:10.240 --> 11:12.160
Phone records.

11:12.160 --> 11:15.080
It felt like forever.

11:15.080 --> 11:16.960
Jared had done something
to his voice,

11:16.960 --> 11:18.840
or he was --
he was putting on a voice.

11:18.840 --> 11:21.960
Well, how did you know
it was Jared?

11:21.960 --> 11:23.400
What did he say?

11:23.400 --> 11:27.160
- He wanted 100
- K in cash.

11:27.160 --> 11:29.400
He said not to call the police.

11:29.400 --> 11:34.600
And then he...

11:34.600 --> 11:37.960
put Marcus on the phone.

11:37.960 --> 11:39.600
He was begging...

11:42.040 --> 11:43.680
Crying.

11:48.440 --> 11:52.800
Then Jared said to wait
for instructions.

11:52.800 --> 11:55.240
But you did call the police.

11:55.240 --> 11:57.400
I made him do that.

11:57.400 --> 11:58.880
Yeah.
I stayed up all night

11:58.880 --> 12:00.000
trying to cobble together
the money.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.080
I had 30 grand in a deposit box,

12:03.080 --> 12:05.360
- Lena had 20
- K stashed
for emergencies,

12:05.360 --> 12:11.160
and then I had to dip
into the safe at Uncharted --

12:11.160 --> 12:12.880
but the instructions never came.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.640
They never came.

12:28.200 --> 12:30.400
There's something else.

12:30.400 --> 12:34.440
Honey, you don't --
you don't have to --

12:34.440 --> 12:36.080
It was my fault.

12:38.480 --> 12:41.080
The young offenders' program
Jared was in,

12:41.080 --> 12:46.840
they came in to do a tour,
and I liked him.

12:46.840 --> 12:48.480
I felt sorry for him.

12:51.400 --> 12:53.280
If it hadn't been for me,

12:53.280 --> 12:55.440
Jared would never have been
working for Marcus.

12:55.440 --> 12:58.480
- You can't blame yourself
Can't I?

12:58.480 --> 13:00.760
Marcus didn't want
to hire Jared.

13:00.760 --> 13:04.160
I talked him into it.

13:04.160 --> 13:07.560
I got my little brother killed.

13:07.560 --> 13:11.000
The ransom call came
from here at 8:53 PM.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.560
Here's what I don't get.

13:12.560 --> 13:14.960
Marcus's house is
five minutes that way.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.120
The tour office is five minutes
in that direction.

13:17.120 --> 13:20.040
But Jared's lock up is
half an hour in that direction.

13:20.040 --> 13:22.040
So why would he come here
to make the ransom call?

13:22.040 --> 13:24.720
A diversion?
Out of his neck of the woods.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.280
He must've known that
he'd be suspected

13:26.280 --> 13:28.080
because Dennie saw him
at the house.

13:28.080 --> 13:29.760
- So?
So, why on earth

13:29.760 --> 13:32.960
would he leave Marcus's body
to be found at his lockup

13:32.960 --> 13:35.640
if he's trying to divert
attention away from himself?

13:42.320 --> 13:43.640
Wait. Not again.

13:43.640 --> 13:45.880
Oh, no...

13:45.880 --> 13:47.160
No...

13:47.160 --> 13:49.080
- Uh-oh.

13:49.080 --> 13:51.240
The fuses are fine.

13:55.840 --> 13:57.720
Five days it took me
to ferment this,

13:57.720 --> 13:59.680
and now it's nothing
but a petri dish.

13:59.680 --> 14:01.360
Your gremlin's under the table!

14:01.360 --> 14:03.040
- I'm so sorry.
- It's fine.

14:03.040 --> 14:05.080
It's probably just something
wrong with the switch board.

14:05.080 --> 14:06.840
Nah, I'm talking to the cat.

14:09.840 --> 14:11.560
Hello, my baby.

14:11.640 --> 14:13.360
Hello, my baby.

14:13.360 --> 14:15.840
So what do we do know?

14:15.840 --> 14:17.640
Well, I just wanna talk
to Jared.

14:17.640 --> 14:20.120
No, I meant about the power.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.320
What a good boy.

14:28.800 --> 14:30.760
Hi, Jared.

14:33.720 --> 14:36.480
I'm Alexa Crowe.

14:36.480 --> 14:37.800
Harry's friend.

14:37.800 --> 14:39.400
Yeah.

14:43.160 --> 14:44.800
How're you holding up?

14:46.880 --> 14:48.240
I'm alright.

14:48.240 --> 14:50.160
It's okay to say you're afraid.

14:50.160 --> 14:51.800
Prison's scary.

14:53.880 --> 14:56.640
You've been in juvie before.

14:56.640 --> 14:59.360
Yeah.

14:59.360 --> 15:00.720
This is worse.

15:00.720 --> 15:02.400
I know.

15:02.400 --> 15:04.000
I shouldn't even be here.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.400
I didn't do it.

15:07.400 --> 15:10.400
Tell me what
you're more afraid of.

15:10.400 --> 15:12.360
Prison or confessing?

15:12.360 --> 15:13.680
I'm not going to confess.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.120
Why would I?

15:17.960 --> 15:20.360
You know, I know that Harry
wouldn't have called me

15:20.360 --> 15:23.560
unless he saw something in you
that was worth the trouble.

15:23.560 --> 15:25.520
And I know you trust Harry,

15:25.520 --> 15:27.360
because otherwise you wouldn't
have agreed to see me.

15:27.360 --> 15:30.560
So I think we know enough
about each other

15:30.560 --> 15:33.760
to call one another
by our first names.

15:33.760 --> 15:35.040
Do we?

15:35.040 --> 15:36.360
Well, you know I trust Harry,

15:36.360 --> 15:40.520
because otherwise
I wouldn't be here.

15:40.520 --> 15:41.760
Do you believe me?

15:41.760 --> 15:45.000
Let's just say I want to.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.120
Now tell me about
Dennie's phone.

15:47.120 --> 15:49.360
She says you took it.

15:49.360 --> 15:51.160
She's lying.

15:51.160 --> 15:53.600
Okay, you tell me through your
version of events that morning.

15:56.520 --> 15:59.880
I went to work,
like every Friday.

15:59.880 --> 16:02.360
But I wasn't gonna do anything
until he paid me.

16:02.360 --> 16:04.200
And that's what you
and Marcus argued about?

16:04.200 --> 16:05.320
Yeah.

16:05.320 --> 16:06.520
I mean...

16:06.520 --> 16:08.280
He hadn't paid me
in over a month.

16:08.280 --> 16:09.640
I've got bills to pay.

16:09.640 --> 16:12.400
Cousins who depend on me.

16:12.400 --> 16:15.560
It got --
I'll admit, it got ugly.

16:15.560 --> 16:16.960
Violent?

16:16.960 --> 16:18.920
I said some things,
he said some things,

16:18.920 --> 16:20.560
but we sorted it.

16:20.560 --> 16:21.760
I never even touched him.

16:21.760 --> 16:23.880
Sorted it how?

16:23.880 --> 16:25.280
Dennie cooled him down.

16:25.280 --> 16:27.360
He promised to pay me later.
Then I left.

16:27.360 --> 16:29.080
I was only there
for like 20 minutes.

16:29.080 --> 16:30.640
Wait a minute.

16:30.640 --> 16:33.760
Dennie cooled him down
before she left for the gym?

16:33.760 --> 16:37.360
No, after. She rang.

16:37.360 --> 16:39.520
He went to talk to her and
he was chill when he came back.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.520
Are you sure that it was
Dennie on the line?

16:41.520 --> 16:43.640
Yeah. I mean, other than
his girlfriend,

16:43.640 --> 16:46.880
who else would he call "baby"?

16:46.880 --> 16:48.640
Okay.

16:48.640 --> 16:53.480
Marcus Farrow's phone records,
ladies and gentlemen and cat.

16:53.480 --> 16:56.720
He got a call at 10:37 AM.

16:56.720 --> 16:58.480
But it didn't come from
Dennie's phone.

16:58.480 --> 16:59.760
It came from a landline.

16:59.760 --> 17:01.640
Have you got a number?

17:01.640 --> 17:03.800
Yep.

17:03.800 --> 17:06.520
Is it registered to an address?

17:06.520 --> 17:08.160
It is.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.440
Well, would you look at that.

17:30.760 --> 17:33.240
- Signing in?
- Oh, that's what these are?

17:33.240 --> 17:35.240
- Sign in sheets, huh?
- Yeah.

17:35.240 --> 17:37.120
Just in case we lose
anyone in the bush.

17:37.120 --> 17:38.560
- Oh.
- Alexa, right?

17:38.560 --> 17:39.880
Yeah. Vincent?

17:39.880 --> 17:41.560
Hey. Can I interest you
in our three-day

17:41.560 --> 17:44.120
White Water Rafting Tour?
It's discounted.

17:44.120 --> 17:46.440
Mm, that seems like
a lot of fun.

17:46.440 --> 17:49.440
Yeah. Well, Connor said I should
work on my salesmanship.

17:49.440 --> 17:51.000
Nah, I'm sure you do great.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.280
Good-looking young guy
like you --

17:52.280 --> 17:53.680
Connor should put you
on the cover.

17:53.680 --> 17:55.320
That's what I said.

17:57.960 --> 17:59.760
So you were here Friday, right?

17:59.760 --> 18:01.280
In the morning?

18:01.280 --> 18:04.240
I saw the sign-in sheet.

18:04.240 --> 18:06.760
Oh, yeah. I was.

18:06.760 --> 18:08.880
Anyone else?

18:08.880 --> 18:10.760
Not in the morning.

18:10.760 --> 18:12.360
Not Marcus's girlfriend?

18:12.360 --> 18:13.760
Dennie?

18:13.760 --> 18:15.600
Not that I saw.

18:15.600 --> 18:18.000
See, there was a phone call
to Marcus

18:18.000 --> 18:21.320
from that phone
at about 10:30 AM.

18:21.320 --> 18:23.760
10:37, to be exact.

18:23.760 --> 18:26.720
4 minutes and 32 seconds long.

18:26.720 --> 18:28.840
- Ring a bell?
- Ah, yeah.

18:28.840 --> 18:30.160
That was me.

18:30.160 --> 18:31.840
I don't know when exactly.

18:31.840 --> 18:36.240
But he was coming in,
so I just asked for an ETA.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.800
Well, you didn't tell Madison
or the police that.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.200
Is it important?

18:40.200 --> 18:41.720
Yeah, maybe.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.400
It means that you could've been
the last person

18:43.400 --> 18:45.600
to speak to Marcus
before he was kidnapped.

18:45.600 --> 18:47.480
Wait.

18:47.480 --> 18:49.120
You alright?

18:53.600 --> 18:56.640
Vincent...

18:56.640 --> 18:59.680
Did Marcus call you "baby"?

18:59.680 --> 19:02.320
What? "Baby"?

19:02.320 --> 19:04.920
- Even in jest.

19:04.920 --> 19:06.400
No.

19:06.400 --> 19:08.640
Nah, he just called me "Vince."

19:18.640 --> 19:21.200
Macchiato Man!
You want a Danish?

19:21.200 --> 19:22.960
I'm watching my sugar.

19:22.960 --> 19:24.600
It's probably smart.

19:26.640 --> 19:29.560
So, is that enough small talk?

19:29.560 --> 19:31.760
I want to see Jared.

19:31.760 --> 19:34.160
It's hard enough convincing him
to meet with Alexa.

19:34.160 --> 19:36.000
I'm pretty low on goodwill.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.320
Did Alexa tell you
how I got into police work?

19:38.320 --> 19:40.040
The youngest
forensics data analyst

19:40.040 --> 19:41.920
in the department's history.

19:41.920 --> 19:45.120
- Quit bragging.
- Yeah, but did she tell you how?

19:45.120 --> 19:47.960
I was 16.

19:47.960 --> 19:51.600
And illegally accessed
a government inquiry

19:51.600 --> 19:54.120
- on climate change.
- So shoplifting for nerds.

19:54.120 --> 19:57.160
Ah, excuse you,
bank robbing for nerds.

19:57.160 --> 19:58.880
Sorry.

19:58.880 --> 20:00.840
The guy who caught me,

20:00.840 --> 20:04.360
he sat me down
and he gave me a choice.

20:04.360 --> 20:07.400
A long prison sentence
and a permanent record,

20:07.400 --> 20:12.400
or a good, respectable job
where I could help people.

20:12.400 --> 20:14.640
Having someone extend a hand
when you need it...

20:14.640 --> 20:16.280
it's rare.

20:16.280 --> 20:18.880
That guy did it for me.
You did it for Jared.

20:18.880 --> 20:21.520
And I'd like to join that club.

20:25.840 --> 20:29.080
You'd tell me if you thought
I was wrong about Jared, right?

20:29.080 --> 20:31.600
You think you might be?

20:31.600 --> 20:33.440
When I first met him,

20:33.440 --> 20:35.080
I thought he was just
another kid

20:35.080 --> 20:38.360
on the fast track
to a long sentence.

20:38.360 --> 20:41.640
Then I found out that he took
the fall for his uncle

20:41.640 --> 20:44.680
so that his cousins
wouldn't have to go into a home.

20:44.680 --> 20:47.120
So maybe you're not wrong.

20:47.120 --> 20:50.160
It's easy to believe the worst
in people.

20:50.160 --> 20:52.560
Believing the best --
that's hard.

20:52.560 --> 20:54.760
But it's worth doing.

20:54.760 --> 20:57.200
I'm gonna take a stab
in the dark and say

20:57.200 --> 20:59.160
Alexa didn't send you here
with my sourdough.

20:59.160 --> 21:01.480
We're having electrical problems
at the apartment.

21:01.480 --> 21:04.000
Right. Dog ate your homework.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.200
Hey. Would I lie to you?

21:06.200 --> 21:08.120
- Yes.
- Yeah.

21:08.120 --> 21:10.200
You're paying.

21:10.200 --> 21:11.800
Fine.

21:17.760 --> 21:19.800
You're a bit young
to be a detective.

21:19.800 --> 21:23.600
Yes, I am.
Thank you for noticing.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.120
So you work for Alexa.

21:25.120 --> 21:26.760
No, I work <i>with</i> Alexa.

21:26.760 --> 21:28.800
Okay.

21:28.800 --> 21:32.040
So?

21:32.040 --> 21:35.360
Jared, none of this
is set in stone.

21:40.400 --> 21:46.400
Alexa asked if it had got
violent with Marcus.

21:46.400 --> 21:47.680
I said no.

21:47.680 --> 21:49.360
But it almost did.

21:49.360 --> 21:50.880
What do you mean?

21:50.880 --> 21:53.040
Standing in his nice house.

21:53.040 --> 21:57.200
This guy who's never had to skip
a meal so someone else can eat.

21:57.200 --> 22:00.160
I wanted to put my fist
to his face.

22:00.160 --> 22:01.800
Show him who he's messing with.

22:04.160 --> 22:06.080
But you didn't.

22:06.080 --> 22:07.800
Before I met Harry,
I would've.

22:07.800 --> 22:09.920
The only reason why I didn't
was 'cause

22:09.920 --> 22:12.480
I didn't want to let him down.

22:12.480 --> 22:15.520
So I went up north.

22:15.520 --> 22:17.160
Calmed down.

22:19.200 --> 22:20.840
We're gonna get you out of here.

22:20.840 --> 22:24.280
All three of us.

22:24.280 --> 22:28.840
Thanks. But I don't wanna
get my hopes up.

22:38.360 --> 22:40.240
- How'd it go with Vincent?
- Oh, my --

22:40.240 --> 22:41.480
Do not do that!

22:41.480 --> 22:42.800
Well, I didn't wanna
turn the light on

22:42.800 --> 22:44.240
and have to
jiggle the alarm again.

22:44.240 --> 22:46.200
So we still have power for now.

22:46.200 --> 22:49.240
If you would just let me
call an electrician...

22:49.240 --> 22:50.560
Do you know what's weird?

22:50.560 --> 22:53.480
What?
- Vincent called Marcus

22:53.480 --> 22:55.600
while Jared was still at the
house -- something about work.

22:55.600 --> 22:57.280
At the same time,
Jared heard enough

22:57.280 --> 22:58.800
of the conversation
to be convinced

22:58.800 --> 23:01.160
that it was Dennie
on the other end of the line.

23:01.160 --> 23:04.160
Somebody is being
a big fat liar.

23:04.160 --> 23:06.000
Well, I don't think
Jared's a liar.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.600
How do you know?

23:07.600 --> 23:10.200
I went to see him.

23:10.200 --> 23:12.080
Did you tell me
you were gonna do that?

23:12.080 --> 23:13.840
Look, I've got a theory.

23:13.840 --> 23:16.520
Jared was arguing with Marcus
about not getting paid, right?

23:16.520 --> 23:17.840
If he took Dennie's phone

23:17.840 --> 23:19.320
and turned it off
three minutes later,

23:19.320 --> 23:21.640
that had to have happened
while they were arguing.

23:21.640 --> 23:23.000
Yeah, go on.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.480
Well, who formulates
a kidnap and ransom plan

23:24.480 --> 23:27.000
in the middle
of a blow-up argument?

23:27.000 --> 23:29.440
So crime of passion
or a crime of premeditation --

23:29.440 --> 23:30.720
- it can't be both.
- Exactly.

23:30.720 --> 23:32.160
And guess what else?

23:32.160 --> 23:34.160
Marcus's finances.

23:34.160 --> 23:35.880
- Insolvency?

23:35.880 --> 23:38.040
Insolvents don't take
two-week trips to Paris

23:38.040 --> 23:41.800
and stay in the Hôtel Valdaro
for 600 Euros a night in --

23:41.800 --> 23:43.280
Oh, the Lovers' Suite.

23:43.280 --> 23:44.920
- Mm.
- What?

23:47.120 --> 23:48.520
So who was he with?

23:50.240 --> 23:52.080
Again?

23:52.080 --> 23:53.680
Why do the fire alarms go off

23:53.680 --> 23:55.800
every time
the bloody power blows?

23:55.800 --> 23:57.840
Because it mimics the effects
of smoke in the air,

23:57.840 --> 23:59.280
which reduces the current.

23:59.280 --> 24:00.920
- So, when the power --
- Rhetorical, Madison.

24:04.600 --> 24:06.800
Jared likes you.

24:06.800 --> 24:08.560
Well, it took him
a minute to warm up.

24:08.560 --> 24:10.400
But, uh...

24:10.400 --> 24:12.760
He likes Madison more.

24:12.760 --> 24:16.720
Comparisons are odious.

24:16.720 --> 24:18.640
So do you think he's innocent?

24:18.640 --> 24:20.240
I don't know yet.

24:20.240 --> 24:22.600
But there's some
reasonable doubt forming.

24:22.600 --> 24:25.080
Want some more?

24:25.080 --> 24:26.480
Yes.

24:26.480 --> 24:27.800
There was a theft

24:27.800 --> 24:30.040
at Hôtel Valdaro in Paris
last year,

24:30.040 --> 24:33.040
so the staff started giving
the guests the option

24:33.040 --> 24:36.200
of leaving their valuables
in the industrial safe.

24:36.200 --> 24:38.600
Which Marcus and his guest did.

24:38.600 --> 24:43.120
The security manager took photos
of their passports.

24:43.120 --> 24:46.120
Yeah, who's the guest?

24:46.120 --> 24:49.240
You know who that is?

24:51.680 --> 24:53.520
- This is Alexa Crowe.

24:53.520 --> 24:55.280
Can you call me back
when you get this?

24:55.280 --> 24:58.200
Thank you.

24:58.200 --> 25:00.120
Okay. No, I'm sorry.
I'm in a rush.

25:00.120 --> 25:01.680
The powerlifter?

25:01.680 --> 25:03.640
Yeah. She's got a competition
next week.

25:03.640 --> 25:05.920
- It's nationals.
- Ooh, nationals. Cool.

25:05.920 --> 25:09.240
Hey, why did Marcus go to Paris
two months ago?

25:09.240 --> 25:10.920
What -- for the investors
convention?

25:10.920 --> 25:14.280
Uh, you know,
to find an investor?

25:14.280 --> 25:16.320
Look, I know that you're just
trying to do your job.

25:16.320 --> 25:19.200
But you really need
to leave me alone.

25:19.200 --> 25:21.160
There's a kid rotting
in a cell right now, Dennie.

25:21.160 --> 25:23.120
And I need to know
if he deserves to be there.

25:23.120 --> 25:25.600
Jared deserves to die in there.

25:25.600 --> 25:27.880
Now if you will excuse me.

25:27.880 --> 25:30.040
Marcus did not
go to Paris alone.

25:33.120 --> 25:34.760
Who?

25:36.880 --> 25:38.520
Who was he with?

25:43.800 --> 25:45.520
They took the Lovers' Suite.

25:48.400 --> 25:51.200
You and Marcus had
an open relationship?

25:51.200 --> 25:54.440
We closed it
after we got engaged.

25:54.440 --> 25:57.280
So you knew that he was
sleeping with Vincent?

25:57.280 --> 25:59.280
Not specifically.

25:59.280 --> 26:00.960
He slept with a lot of people.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.000
Doesn't mean he didn't love me
any less.

26:03.000 --> 26:08.120
And vacations with boyfriends is
okay in the polyamory rule book?

26:08.120 --> 26:10.400
He was under a lot of pressure.

26:10.400 --> 26:11.800
Why?

26:11.800 --> 26:13.280
Well, you pick.

26:13.280 --> 26:17.360
Connor coming back,
trouble with the business.

26:17.360 --> 26:19.040
What stuff with the business?

26:20.800 --> 26:22.360
You might as well tell me,

26:22.360 --> 26:25.880
otherwise I'll just find out
like I did with this.

26:25.880 --> 26:30.800
After his parents died,
Marcus had issues.

26:30.800 --> 26:33.120
With addiction.

26:35.520 --> 26:38.600
The business struggled.

26:38.600 --> 26:42.120
Connor came back to help,
Marcus got better.

26:42.120 --> 26:43.680
He was trying to
earn back trust.

26:43.680 --> 26:46.320
He was trying to prove
that he could take charge again.

26:50.600 --> 26:52.520
There now.
Was that so hard?

26:55.160 --> 26:58.440
You know you don't have
to do that.

26:58.440 --> 27:02.960
That painting him as perfect
to explain why you loved him.

27:02.960 --> 27:05.080
Marcus was imperfect.

27:05.080 --> 27:07.280
You loved him.

27:07.280 --> 27:09.960
That's all.

27:09.960 --> 27:13.240
We found Marcus's body inside.

27:13.240 --> 27:15.560
But no witnesses saw Jared
bring him here.

27:19.080 --> 27:22.640
So the police found
no forensic evidence in here?

27:22.640 --> 27:24.600
Blood, hair, prints...

27:24.600 --> 27:25.760
Some.

27:25.760 --> 27:27.800
Not as much as you'd expect.

27:27.800 --> 27:29.800
Could've been cleaned up.

27:29.800 --> 27:32.360
Or maybe Marcus wasn't
killed here.

27:32.360 --> 27:34.080
Maybe his body
was just left here.

27:37.680 --> 27:39.320
Hang on.

27:43.200 --> 27:44.360
You took that?

27:44.360 --> 27:46.720
Yeah, I was proud of him.

27:46.720 --> 27:49.600
That's the lock that Jared
put on the door.

27:49.600 --> 27:53.440
And that's the one
the police broke to get in.

27:53.440 --> 27:55.560
They look like
different padlocks to you?

28:01.320 --> 28:03.040
The lock was changed.

28:03.040 --> 28:06.280
Yeah, somebody must have
cut the old one and replaced it.

28:06.280 --> 28:09.360
The question is, who and when?

28:09.360 --> 28:11.720
Okay. Can I plug these things
back in now?

28:11.720 --> 28:13.200
Yeah, one by one
until we find the one

28:13.200 --> 28:14.640
that's causing the problem.

28:14.640 --> 28:16.840
Or, you know, we could call
an electrician.

28:16.840 --> 28:19.320
Nah, it's much more fun
this way.

28:19.320 --> 28:21.080
Could Dennie and Vincent
have been working together?

28:21.080 --> 28:23.720
Yep, possible.

28:23.720 --> 28:25.600
But why call?

28:25.600 --> 28:27.120
I mean, why leave that thread
dangling at all?

28:27.120 --> 28:28.800
To check whether Jared was still
at the house.

28:28.800 --> 28:31.760
I mean, that's the linchpin
of whole the plan, right?

28:31.760 --> 28:34.240
Vincent cannot come
and kidnap Marcus

28:34.240 --> 28:36.000
until they know
that the scapegoat,

28:36.000 --> 28:38.800
Jared, has been to the house
and gone again.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.840
So the fiancée
and the lover team up

28:40.840 --> 28:42.920
and split the life insurance.

28:42.920 --> 28:45.000
Unexpected,
but oddly empowering.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.800
Marcus did come back
from Paris

28:46.800 --> 28:48.400
and immediately
propose to Dennie.

28:48.400 --> 28:50.280
So motive wise...

28:50.280 --> 28:52.440
The fact that he went
in the first place?

28:52.440 --> 28:53.960
Hell hath no fury.

28:53.960 --> 28:56.320
Yeah, but Vincent
was scorned, too.

28:56.320 --> 28:58.960
Right? Marcus takes him on this
romantic Parisian holiday,

28:58.960 --> 29:01.600
goes the whole nine yards
with the Lovers' Suite,

29:01.600 --> 29:03.360
and then he comes home
and immediately

29:03.360 --> 29:05.520
gets engaged to Dennie.

29:05.520 --> 29:09.000
- Yeah, I'd kill him.
Yeah.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.760
You know,
if they always intended

29:10.760 --> 29:12.800
to collect the life insurance,

29:12.800 --> 29:15.240
then Marcus always had to die.

29:15.240 --> 29:17.240
So the ransom call
was a red herring?

29:17.240 --> 29:18.800
We're not going to be able
to prove any of this

29:18.800 --> 29:22.280
until we crack Vincent.

29:22.280 --> 29:23.360
- Huzzah!

29:23.360 --> 29:26.600
Hey!

29:26.600 --> 29:29.200
Did Marcus say anything
in the ransom call?

29:29.200 --> 29:30.560
Any clue?

29:30.560 --> 29:32.600
If he did, I missed it.

29:32.600 --> 29:34.680
I missed a lot of things.

29:34.680 --> 29:36.800
When's the funeral?
Monday.

29:36.800 --> 29:38.840
This morning I picked the spot
to scatter his ashes.

29:38.840 --> 29:41.040
Looks right out
over the Waitemata.

29:41.040 --> 29:42.640
It's gonna be a closed-casket
funeral, though.

29:42.640 --> 29:44.760
Which is a shame,
'cause he was --

29:44.760 --> 29:48.200
Well, he was real proud
of being the hotter brother.

29:48.200 --> 29:51.400
Connor, just 'cause you don't
know everything about him

29:51.400 --> 29:53.760
doesn't make what you do know
any less real.

29:56.120 --> 29:59.400
There.

29:59.400 --> 30:01.040
Thanks.

30:10.080 --> 30:13.120
What the hell are you
doing here?

30:13.120 --> 30:16.000
How was Paris?

30:16.000 --> 30:18.120
We've got your passport.

30:18.120 --> 30:19.360
Hôtel Valdaro?

30:19.360 --> 30:22.800
The Lovers' Suite?

30:22.800 --> 30:24.160
Why are you doing this?

30:24.160 --> 30:26.120
'Cause I want to know
who killed Marcus.

30:26.120 --> 30:28.680
Well, the guy who killed him
is in a cell.

30:28.680 --> 30:29.920
Look, why don't you
leave me alone?

30:29.920 --> 30:31.280
Why don't you
leave Dennie alone?

30:31.280 --> 30:32.640
Let's talk about Dennie.

30:32.640 --> 30:34.040
Did you two ever chat about

30:34.040 --> 30:37.760
being screwed over
by the same guy?

30:37.760 --> 30:39.160
Where were you
the rest of the day

30:39.160 --> 30:40.600
when Marcus was kidnapped?

30:40.600 --> 30:42.440
You're sick in the head.

30:42.440 --> 30:46.320
Were you angry that he came back
and proposed to Dennie?

30:46.320 --> 30:48.120
Look, he was going
to come back to me.

30:48.120 --> 30:52.280
He was always going to come
back to me because he loved me.

30:52.280 --> 30:53.560
Did he tell you that?

30:53.560 --> 30:55.240
Yeah.

30:55.240 --> 30:56.800
Here.

30:56.800 --> 30:59.600
He told me that he loved me
right here.

31:08.320 --> 31:09.640
Yeah.

31:09.640 --> 31:10.920
Where the hell are you?

31:10.920 --> 31:13.800
I've been calling you
for an hour.

31:13.800 --> 31:15.560
What do you have?

31:15.560 --> 31:17.640
Vincent's got a solid alibi
for the day Marcus disappeared.

31:17.640 --> 31:20.160
He picked up a tour group
from town at 9:00,

31:20.160 --> 31:21.640
drove them to HQ,
and took them out

31:21.640 --> 31:23.320
right after his call to Marcus.

31:23.320 --> 31:25.320
Overnighter.
Multiple witnesses.

31:25.320 --> 31:27.000
And there's more.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.600
The trip to Paris?

31:28.600 --> 31:30.600
Marcus didn't just go
for the investors.

31:30.600 --> 31:32.160
He went for the casinos.

31:32.160 --> 31:34.880
- What?20 - K at Club Elyses,

31:34.880 --> 31:37.360
30 at the poker room
of Clichy Montmartre,

31:37.360 --> 31:39.320
and 70 at the Aviation Club.

31:39.320 --> 31:40.680
Where the hell
did he get the money

31:40.680 --> 31:42.520
if he couldn't even pay Jared?

31:42.520 --> 31:45.400
No, no. He couldn't pay Jared <i>
because</i> of all this money.

31:45.400 --> 31:47.720
He'd been taking it out
of Uncharted's accounts.

31:47.720 --> 31:50.600
I mean, dodgy invoices for
equipment and services that,

31:50.600 --> 31:52.840
as far as I can tell,
were never delivered.

31:52.840 --> 31:54.560
Marcus was stealing?

31:54.560 --> 31:55.760
From his own business?

31:55.760 --> 31:57.520
From his own brother.

31:57.520 --> 32:00.440
Connor had been shoring up the
funds ever since he got back.

32:00.440 --> 32:03.120
And he's inheriting
Marcus's house,

32:03.120 --> 32:07.000
which he had valued
two days ago.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.240
How much is it worth?

32:08.240 --> 32:09.960
1.5 million,

32:09.960 --> 32:11.480
enough to pull
the business out of the hole.

32:11.480 --> 32:13.520
So there's Connor's motive.

32:13.520 --> 32:15.520
Yep.

32:15.520 --> 32:17.160
Alexa, where are you?

32:19.480 --> 32:21.120
Vincent headed on back.

32:23.200 --> 32:24.960
I think you ruined
his happy place.

33:54.960 --> 33:56.200
<i>This is Alexa Crowe.</i>

33:56.200 --> 33:57.960
<i>You know what to do.</i>

33:57.960 --> 34:00.320
Alexa, you're really scaring me.

34:00.320 --> 34:02.920
Are you out of range
or just ignoring me or what?

34:02.920 --> 34:04.520
Just please call me back.

34:23.880 --> 34:25.720
She went looking for Vincent.

34:25.720 --> 34:27.520
No, I'm not sure
if she found him or not,

34:27.520 --> 34:30.200
but what if
she's lost out there?

34:30.200 --> 34:33.040
No, Harry,
I'm not over-reacting!

34:59.120 --> 35:01.280
Any news?

35:01.280 --> 35:03.440
Look. Hey, tell me where
the search party's starting,

35:03.440 --> 35:05.040
and I'll meet you there.

35:05.040 --> 35:07.720
No, I'm not just going
to stay here and wait!

35:11.040 --> 35:13.600
Miss me?

35:13.600 --> 35:17.440
You've got a sick sense
of humor, you know that?

35:17.440 --> 35:20.800
It was Connor.

35:20.800 --> 35:22.400
Connor and I both
called the police

35:22.400 --> 35:24.000
to tell them you were missing.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.200
Well, he's smart.
I'll give him that.

35:26.200 --> 35:27.920
We just need
some solid evidence.

35:27.920 --> 35:30.800
Alexa, he left you to die.

35:30.800 --> 35:33.000
It's my word against his.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.400
- On the bright side...
- Oh, there's a bright side?

35:35.400 --> 35:39.960
...we know that Harry
is right about Jared.

35:39.960 --> 35:42.440
But proving it... Hmm.

35:44.720 --> 35:48.200
Don't do that again.

35:48.200 --> 35:51.320
Yeah, okay.

35:51.320 --> 35:54.000
So how did he do it?

35:54.000 --> 35:55.280
I don't know.

35:55.280 --> 35:57.160
See, it's all about timing.

35:57.160 --> 36:00.080
Dennie's phone made
the ransom call from the park.

36:00.080 --> 36:03.840
Connor got it at home
with a witness.

36:03.840 --> 36:06.200
- Could she be lying about it?
- No, no.

36:06.200 --> 36:09.920
His phone was at his house
when the ransom call came.

36:09.920 --> 36:11.360
Yeah, a defense lawyer's
gonna ask

36:11.360 --> 36:12.920
how he could be
in two places at once.

36:12.920 --> 36:16.840
Hell, I'm asking how he could be
in two places at once.

36:16.840 --> 36:19.080
Got any ice cream?

36:19.080 --> 36:21.880
Oh, that poor,
scapegoated toaster.

36:21.880 --> 36:25.200
Look, I'll check
the switchboard.

36:25.200 --> 36:28.000
Don't worry.
I'll get it myself.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.640
Yes!

36:46.360 --> 36:48.920
Okay, so power circuit
number 3 is tripping out,

36:48.920 --> 36:50.200
and that's throwing out
the main.

36:50.200 --> 36:51.640
I think that that means

36:51.640 --> 36:53.120
that there's a problem
somewhere in the kitchen.

36:53.120 --> 36:55.640
Are you listening to me?

36:55.640 --> 36:57.960
- Look at the oven.
No. It's not the oven.

36:57.960 --> 36:59.240
Look, I really, really,
really think

36:59.240 --> 37:01.400
that we should
just call an electrician.

37:01.400 --> 37:03.520
Nah. Forget the electricity.

37:03.520 --> 37:06.400
What?

37:06.400 --> 37:09.200
I think I know how he did it.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.440
Oh, my God.

37:19.440 --> 37:20.800
Connor told me what happened.
Are you okay?

37:20.800 --> 37:22.280
Yeah. Yeah.

37:22.280 --> 37:23.600
Hey, um, Lena, I just wanted

37:23.600 --> 37:25.600
to ask you a question
about the case.

37:25.600 --> 37:27.400
Oh, Connor's at work.

37:27.400 --> 37:29.120
No, this one's for you.

37:29.120 --> 37:31.560
The night that Connor got
the ransom call,

37:31.560 --> 37:33.480
he said you were here at home.

37:33.480 --> 37:36.240
- Yeah.
- What did you have for dinner?

37:36.240 --> 37:38.280
Um, Chinese.

37:38.280 --> 37:40.000
Delivery?

37:40.000 --> 37:43.200
No, Connor went to pick it up.

37:43.200 --> 37:45.600
Can I look at your clocks?

37:45.600 --> 37:48.720
Hey, babe.

37:48.720 --> 37:50.360
Got lunch.

37:53.440 --> 37:55.080
What's wrong?

37:57.840 --> 38:01.200
Condolences from Nancy and Bob.

38:01.200 --> 38:06.160
I was gonna come by,
see how you were doing.

38:06.160 --> 38:07.880
That is so sweet of you.

38:07.880 --> 38:09.000
- Honey.
- Don't.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.560
No, no.

38:11.560 --> 38:13.760
So, did you get
any offers on the house?

38:13.760 --> 38:16.400
- What?
- Marcus's house.

38:16.400 --> 38:18.000
Well, your parents' house.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.400
You know, the one that you knew
well enough to slip into

38:20.400 --> 38:22.440
on the day
that Marcus disappeared.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.920
You waited until after
Dennie and Jared left.

38:30.440 --> 38:32.640
And then you killed
your own brother.

38:36.400 --> 38:38.400
Do you have a warrant?

38:38.400 --> 38:41.040
Ah, I don't need one of those.

38:41.040 --> 38:42.680
Lena let me in.

38:44.840 --> 38:46.440
Sit down.

38:53.480 --> 38:55.640
You took Marcus
to Jared's garage...

39:01.400 --> 39:03.240
...and you replaced the lock.

39:03.240 --> 39:07.080
See, I don't think that
Marcus died on Friday night.

39:07.080 --> 39:09.240
I think he died
on Friday morning.

39:09.240 --> 39:11.280
Who did I talk to
on the ransom call?

39:11.280 --> 39:12.920
Honey, you heard me.

39:12.920 --> 39:16.080
Don't be silly.
There was no ransom call.

39:16.080 --> 39:19.720
Just a shoddy little trick.

39:19.720 --> 39:22.200
When you left Dennie's house
that morning,

39:22.200 --> 39:25.280
you turned off her phone
so it couldn't be tracked.

39:25.280 --> 39:26.760
And then that night,
you told Lena

39:26.760 --> 39:29.000
that you were going out
to pick up dinner.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.200
Which I did.

39:30.200 --> 39:32.280
Which you did.

39:32.280 --> 39:35.400
But you left your phone here,
probably right outside the door.

39:35.400 --> 39:38.000
And you switched on
the "auto-answer" function.

39:38.000 --> 39:42.800
Then you made a stop at the park
to make your ransom call.

39:42.800 --> 39:46.360
Then you came home where
you pretended to get the call.

39:46.360 --> 39:48.440
Saying it was Jared
on the phone.

39:48.440 --> 39:51.000
Check the time!

39:51.000 --> 39:52.360
But you see,
what Lena didn't know

39:52.360 --> 39:56.600
is that you'd set the clocks
back 20 minutes.

39:56.600 --> 39:58.480
20 minutes is all you needed.

39:58.480 --> 40:03.400
So, that when she went to
check the time, it said 8:53,

40:03.400 --> 40:06.040
when in actual fact,
it was 20 minutes later.

40:06.040 --> 40:09.320
You'd given yourself an alibi.

40:09.320 --> 40:12.800
You can't seriously
believe this.

40:12.800 --> 40:16.640
You reset the time on my phone.

40:16.640 --> 40:20.280
Were you angry, Connor?

40:20.280 --> 40:23.800
I mean, you'd given up a lot,
hadn't you?

40:23.800 --> 40:26.760
To come back here
and look after your brother.

40:26.760 --> 40:29.920
To rescue the business.

40:29.920 --> 40:32.760
And you didn't even mind,
as long as you were appreciated.

40:32.760 --> 40:34.480
But when you were
fixing his accounts,

40:34.480 --> 40:37.440
you found out not only
were you unappreciated,

40:37.440 --> 40:40.600
but he had just been
gambling away all your money

40:40.600 --> 40:43.600
and hard work all over Europe.

40:43.600 --> 40:49.400
In romantic hotel trysts
and casinos.

40:49.400 --> 40:51.880
Connor.

40:51.880 --> 40:53.040
How could you do this?

40:53.040 --> 40:55.000
He was your brother.

40:55.000 --> 40:59.040
And you set up an
innocent man to take the fall.

40:59.040 --> 41:02.200
That's just -- everything you
just said is circumstantial.

41:02.200 --> 41:04.600
You know what's
not circumstantial?

41:04.600 --> 41:06.320
Marcus's blood.

41:06.320 --> 41:09.400
In the boot of your car.

41:09.400 --> 41:11.280
Microfibers.

41:16.880 --> 41:18.800
And you owe me a phone.

41:43.720 --> 41:45.160
Hey.

41:45.160 --> 41:46.800
Why're you so bloody early
all the time, man?

41:46.800 --> 41:48.080
I don't know. Bad habit.

41:48.080 --> 41:49.280
Jared.

41:49.280 --> 41:51.920
- Oh, man.
- You okay?

41:51.920 --> 41:53.040
- Yeah, man.
- You look good.

41:53.040 --> 41:54.520
- Look at this.
- Yeah, bro.

41:54.520 --> 41:57.400
Bro, almost, eh?

41:57.400 --> 42:00.920
I thought Madison called
an electrician.

42:00.920 --> 42:03.360
No, I don't like having people
I don't know in my house.

42:03.360 --> 42:05.120
- Can you fix it?
- God, no.

42:05.120 --> 42:09.720
I thought we were just staring
at it together in solidarity.

42:09.720 --> 42:11.360
Hey, Jared might know.

42:11.360 --> 42:13.240
I could ask him to come
and take a look this weekend.

42:13.240 --> 42:14.600
Is he an electrician?

42:14.600 --> 42:16.440
No, but at least you know him.

42:18.520 --> 42:20.720
Thank you.

42:20.720 --> 42:23.520
I probably don't say it enough.
But thank you.

42:26.040 --> 42:28.800
Weren't you and Jared supposed
to be out on a boys' night?

42:28.800 --> 42:32.040
We were.
And then I thought about you.

42:32.040 --> 42:36.200
Sad and alone on a Friday night,
channel surfing,

42:36.200 --> 42:38.000
eating a microwave dinner.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.560
He ditched you for Madison,
didn't he?

42:40.560 --> 42:42.160
Yep.

42:48.680 --> 42:50.400
First pat down by a cop?

42:50.400 --> 42:51.680
Never.

42:51.680 --> 42:54.400
But I have had
a scary interrogation.

42:54.400 --> 42:57.280
Two-way mirror,
good cop, bad cop, the works.

42:57.280 --> 42:58.720
You?

42:58.720 --> 43:01.360
First pat down by a cop at 11.

43:01.360 --> 43:05.000
Yeah, stole my neighbor's car
and went for a joyride.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.840
Alright. First arrest?
Together, on three.

43:06.840 --> 43:08.160
- Okay.
- One, two, three.

43:08.160 --> 43:09.160
- 16.
- 13.

43:09.160 --> 43:10.720
Oh, you're beating me!

43:10.720 --> 43:12.800
I'm a delinquent.
What did they get you for?

43:12.800 --> 43:15.760
Activism. Well, okay.
I say it's activism now,

43:15.760 --> 43:18.440
but really I just did it
for the fun of it.

43:20.600 --> 43:22.720
We've come a long way, eh?

43:22.720 --> 43:24.360
We had help.

43:26.800 --> 43:28.400
You ever think about
what it'd be like if --

43:28.400 --> 43:31.200
All the time.

43:31.200 --> 43:34.200
But now?

43:34.200 --> 43:37.320
Now I mostly just think
about where I'm going.
