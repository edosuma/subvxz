NEWER MUSTANGS,
BOSS 429s, ALL THE GTs.

37:43.344 --> 37:46.137
ANYTHING IN THE FORD WORLD
YOU LIKE, IT'S HERE.

37:48.793 --> 37:50.206
Richard:
FOR THE SIZE OF THAT CROWD,
IT LOOKS LIKE

37:50.206 --> 37:52.586
MY "THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR" CAR
IS STEALING THE SHOW.

37:52.586 --> 37:55.206
SO IF WE WANT THE TOP TO GO UP,
WE JUST SPIN THIS OUT.

37:55.206 --> 37:58.965
-OH, THAT'S COOL.
-AS HE DROPS IT.

37:58.965 --> 38:00.344
Kid: THAT'S COOL.

38:00.344 --> 38:03.379
RICHARD, IS THIS THE CRANK
THAT CRANKS THE WINDOWS UP?

38:03.379 --> 38:04.827
-YES, SIR.
-WOW.

38:04.827 --> 38:07.206
-YEAH.
-YEAH. THAT'S CLASSY.

38:07.206 --> 38:09.413
WELL, IT'S
A LITTLE BIT CUSTOM.

38:09.413 --> 38:11.620
WHAT HAS BEEN DONE TO THIS MOTOR
AND EVERYTHING?

38:11.620 --> 38:14.379
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
WE BASICALLY BUILT THE CAR

38:14.379 --> 38:16.275
FROM THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT
TO THE BOTTOM.

38:16.275 --> 38:17.758
HOW MANY HORSES ARE YOU
GETTING OUT OF IT?

38:17.758 --> 38:20.448
-IT'S 415 HORSEPOWER.
-YEAH. YEAH, IT IS.

38:20.448 --> 38:21.965
IT'S DOUBLE ALMOST
TO WHAT HE HAD IN IT.

38:21.965 --> 38:24.482
WHEN THERE'S A TRAFFIC JAM,
I'M LIKE, "YEAH, SUCKERS!" WHOO!

38:24.482 --> 38:25.793
[ LAUGHTER ]

38:27.068 --> 38:28.413
Man: I THINK THEY PUT THAT OUT
ON THE MARKET

38:28.413 --> 38:29.724
THAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO 10.
-YEAH.

38:29.724 --> 38:31.517
THEY ALL SOLD
WITHIN 24 HOURS.

38:31.517 --> 38:33.103
NO KIDDING.

38:33.103 --> 38:34.793
Richard:
THIS IS LIKE BEING A BIG KID
IN A SHELBY CANDY SHOP.

38:34.793 --> 38:36.379
I MEAN,
JUST LOOK AT THESE CARS.

38:36.379 --> 38:38.655
-NOT STOCK.
-IS THAT REALLY 8.7 LITERS?

38:38.655 --> 38:40.827
Brian: SO THAT'S LIKE A
600-CUBIC-INCH MOTOR, TOO.

38:40.827 --> 38:42.586
NOW, IN THE MACH 1s
THAT WERE THIS COLOR,

38:42.586 --> 38:44.310
THEY HAD
THE REFLECTIVE STRIPE, RIGHT?

38:44.310 --> 38:45.862
Man: YES, ON THE MACH 1s,
YES. YEAH.

38:45.862 --> 38:47.000
Richard: YEAH. ALL RIGHT.
WHERE WE GOING?

38:47.000 --> 38:48.172
-ALL RIGHT.
-WHERE ARE THE REAL CARS?

38:48.172 --> 38:49.551
RICHARD, WELL, IF YOU
CAN EVER GET HIM TO...

38:49.551 --> 38:50.896
HE JUST...
HE VEERS OFF.

38:50.896 --> 38:52.068
IS IT AN R, OR IS...

38:52.068 --> 38:53.586
WHAT DID YOU START WITH,
JUST A BASIC SHELBY?

38:53.586 --> 38:55.655
-THE GT.
-I WOULDN'T MIND BUILDING ONE.

38:55.655 --> 38:57.586
Jason:
IF WE BUILD A CAR LIKE THIS,
JUST FOR EXAMPLE,

38:57.586 --> 39:00.827
THAT BATTERY CABLE SETUP
IS 3Gs BY ITSELF.

39:00.827 --> 39:04.275
SO HOW MUCH IS THIS
$3,500 MUSTANG?

39:04.275 --> 39:06.034
YOU GOT '69 AND '70
MACH 1s.

39:06.034 --> 39:09.034
YOU'VE GOT
EARLY MODEL GT CARS.

39:09.034 --> 39:11.206
YOU'VE GOT BRAND-NEW
FORD GTs.

39:11.206 --> 39:13.862
-YEAH.
-GOLLY, THIS CAR IS JUST KILLER.

39:13.862 --> 39:16.965
YOU KNOW WHAT IT NEEDS?
A BIG, GIANT R RIGHT THERE.

39:16.965 --> 39:20.551
THIS GUY HAD ONE IN GULF LIVERY,
AND I REALLY WANTED THE CAR.

39:20.551 --> 39:23.896
Jason:
HE'S GOT ONE OF EACH GT40 IN ALL
THREE DIFFERENT ITERATIONS.

39:23.896 --> 39:25.172
Man:
YEP, '68, 2006 AND THE '18.

39:25.172 --> 39:27.068
ALL GULF BLUE LIVERY,
THAT'S AWESOME.

39:27.068 --> 39:28.551
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR IT?

39:28.551 --> 39:30.206
IT WOULD START
PROBABLY ABOUT 2 MILLION.

39:30.206 --> 39:33.551
MAN, I WAS REALLY STRONG
AT 1.

39:33.551 --> 39:35.103
IF I GAVE YOU
2 MILLION FOR IT...

39:35.103 --> 39:37.068
I'D JUST KEEP SMILING,
AND YOU WOULDN'T GET TO HAVE IT.

39:37.068 --> 39:38.275
THAT GUY IS LIVING RIGHT
IF HE CAN TURN DOWN

39:38.275 --> 39:39.586
2 MILS JUST LIKE THAT.
-YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

39:39.586 --> 39:41.241
IF YOU WANT TO SELL IT
FOR 2 MILLION, YOU CALL ME.

39:41.241 --> 39:42.413
I'M YOUR BUYER.
-OKAY.

39:42.413 --> 39:44.586
I CAN WIRE IT
WITHIN 45 MINUTES.

39:44.586 --> 39:46.965
JUST BETWEEN US,
I DIDN'T HAVE THE 2 MILLION.

39:46.965 --> 39:48.931
I'LL SAY, DAPHNE
IS GOING TO BE...

39:48.931 --> 39:50.172
Richard: COME ON.

39:50.172 --> 39:52.896
THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT
TO CHECK OUT OVER HERE.

39:52.896 --> 39:57.241
THIS IS A CAR I'VE ALWAYS
WANTED, KR500 FOUR-SPEED.

39:57.241 --> 39:58.896
PLEASE TELL ME

39:58.896 --> 40:00.137
-AUTOMATIC.

40:00.137 --> 40:01.310
-I'D STILL DO IT.
-STILL CLOSE.

40:01.310 --> 40:02.931
MAN, LOOK HOW ORIGINAL
THE CAR IS.

40:02.931 --> 40:04.206
Richard:
SO I SAW MY FAVORITE CAR,

40:04.206 --> 40:05.448
I MEAN, THE CAR I'VE BEEN
LOOKING FOR ALL MY LIFE.

40:05.448 --> 40:06.620
-LIME GOLD.
-LIME GOLD

40:06.620 --> 40:10.068
-LIME GOLD.
-FIVE HUNDRED KR, CONVERTIBLE.

40:10.068 --> 40:11.379
I BET IT'S ORIGINAL
ALL THE WAY AROUND.

40:11.379 --> 40:13.034
FE MOTOR, 428 COBRA JET,
FRONT [INDISTINCT].

40:13.034 --> 40:15.655
IT'S ORIGINAL EVERYTHING, HUH?
ARE YOU THE OWNER?

40:15.655 --> 40:17.172
YES, I AM.RICHARD RAWLINGS, HOW YOU DOING?

40:17.172 --> 40:18.620
DENNIS SNOW,
NICE TO MEET YOU.

40:18.620 --> 40:20.103
AND THIS IS YOUR CAR,
ONE OWNER?

40:20.103 --> 40:22.172
THIS IS MY CAR,
ONE OWNER FOR 50 YEARS.

40:22.172 --> 40:23.931
-GOD, IT'S GORGEOUS.
-WOW.

40:23.931 --> 40:26.000
FREAKING SUPERCOOL.
ALL RIGHT.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.034
Richard:
YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO ASK,
DENNIS, HOW MUCH?

40:28.034 --> 40:29.724
-HOW MUCH WHAT?
-FOR THIS CAR?

40:29.724 --> 40:31.137
[ LAUGHS ]

40:31.137 --> 40:33.482
COME ON.
YOU'VE OWNED IT FOR 50 YEARS.

40:33.482 --> 40:34.931
YEAH.

40:34.931 --> 40:38.241
IT'S TIME TO LET SOMEBODY ELSE
HAVE THE PRIVILEGE.

40:38.241 --> 40:40.344
I FIGURE THIS CAR,
AT A GOOD AUCTION,

40:40.344 --> 40:43.275
WOULD BRING $130,000-$150,000
IN TODAY'S MARKET,

40:43.275 --> 40:45.827
BUT I'LL GIVE YOU $200,000
FOR THIS CAR RIGHT NOW.

40:45.827 --> 40:47.275
-WOW.
-WOW.

40:47.275 --> 40:49.482
I OFFERED HIM $200,000,
WHICH IS $50,000 OVER...

40:49.482 --> 40:50.758
-YEAH.
-YEAH.
-...WHAT IT'S WORTH.

40:50.758 --> 40:52.689
-NOT NOW.
-THAT'S THE LOVE, RIGHT?

40:52.689 --> 40:54.344
SHOULD I GO GET THE BEER
AND COME BACK IN A MINUTE?

40:54.344 --> 40:55.827
[ LAUGHTER ]

40:55.827 --> 40:57.172
MIGHT GET HIM A BEER TOO
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT.

40:57.172 --> 40:58.724
THEN I OFFERED HIM
$201,000.

40:58.724 --> 41:01.896
AND HE JUST STARTS
LAUGHING AT YOU.

41:01.896 --> 41:03.827
MAYBE IN A FEW YEARS,
BUT NOT RIGHT NOW.

41:03.827 --> 41:05.344
-DENNIS, THANK YOU, MAN.
-THANK YOU.

41:05.344 --> 41:06.862
-SUPERCOOL CAR.
-APPRECIATE IT.

41:06.862 --> 41:08.689
BEST CAR OUT HERE, I DON'T
CARE ABOUT EVEN THE NEW ONES.

41:08.689 --> 41:11.172
-THIS IS RAD.
-THANK YOU.
-THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

41:11.172 --> 41:12.344
-THANK YOU.
-THANK YOU.

41:12.344 --> 41:13.758
Richard: I THINK WE KNOCKED IT
OUT OF THE PARK.

41:13.758 --> 41:16.206
THIS WAS A BIG WIN, AND IF I'M
RIGHT, WHICH I USUALLY AM,

41:16.206 --> 41:17.862
THIS OPENED UP
A WHOLE NEW MARKET FOR US.

41:17.862 --> 41:19.689
WE'RE JUST GOING TO STICK IT ON
THE TRAILER, GET IT BACK HOME,

41:19.689 --> 41:22.034
AND THEN NOW I CAN ACTUALLY
START DRIVING IT AGAIN.

41:22.034 --> 41:24.137
I BEEN A VERY BAD CAR OWNER
FOR, LIKE, 5 YEARS.

41:24.137 --> 41:25.413
YES.

41:25.413 --> 41:26.379
PLEASE TAKE CARE OF THIS ONE
A LITTLE BETTER, PLEASE.

41:26.379 --> 41:27.758
-YES. ENJOY IT.
-OH, NO.

41:27.758 --> 41:29.482
AS LONG AS I GOT Y'ALL, I CAN
DO ANYTHING I WANT TO TO IT.

41:29.482 --> 41:30.620
WELL, IF HE DOESN'T DRIVE
IT, YOU AND I ARE GOING TO
TAKE IT OUT AND DRIVE IT.

41:30.620 --> 41:31.758
HEY. I'M DOWN WITH THAT.

41:31.758 --> 41:32.931
LET'S DO IT.
-IT'S A NICE CAR.
