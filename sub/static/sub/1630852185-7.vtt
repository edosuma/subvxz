WEBVTT

00:03.629 --> 00:04.797
and we change the world.

00:04.880 --> 00:07.216
Every penny from every copy sold

00:07.299 --> 00:09.677
is gonna go straight
to help the war on drugs.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.137
This is personal for you.

00:11.220 --> 00:12.513
[Cray] My brother was a drug addict.

00:12.596 --> 00:15.433
Drug addiction kills hundreds
of thousands of people every year.

00:15.516 --> 00:16.517
We're gonna end that.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.102
[Alex] Damian Cray is dangerous.

00:18.185 --> 00:20.104
Damian Cray tried to kill Ed Pleasance.

00:22.565 --> 00:25.234
We need protection against Damian Cray.

00:25.317 --> 00:28.946
SCORPIA are targeting
the president of the United States.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.866
Because Damian Cray wants them to.

00:31.949 --> 00:33.701
They think Cray's the victim.

00:33.784 --> 00:34.869
They're working with him.

00:34.952 --> 00:37.621
But when he was speaking,
I heard something.

00:39.498 --> 00:41.125
[Kyra] I think the game is not a game.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.711
I think it's supposed to do
something totally different.

00:43.794 --> 00:45.671
- But it's there?
- The only way to unlock this

00:45.755 --> 00:47.131
is to go back to the original server,

00:47.214 --> 00:49.175
and that's at Craystar in Amsterdam.

00:49.258 --> 00:50.468
[Alex] Air Force One.

00:50.551 --> 00:53.888
Blunt said SCORPIA were targeting
the president of the United States.

00:53.971 --> 00:56.849
- [Kyra] I'm taking security settings off.
- Awesome.

00:56.932 --> 00:59.310
Yes, this is it. This is the hidden code.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.771
We're just copying the game code.
It's gonna take some time.

01:01.854 --> 01:04.315
[Tom] Cray's coming. He's in the building!

01:05.649 --> 01:06.859
[Kyra] Alex!

01:06.942 --> 01:09.445
Damian, please. This isn't who you are.

01:09.528 --> 01:11.238
[Cray] You have no idea who I am.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.365
- No!
- [thuds]

01:16.368 --> 01:19.371
[ominous music playing]

01:47.817 --> 01:50.820
I really wasn't expecting
to see you here, K7.

01:51.612 --> 01:52.696
This is all a big mistake.

01:52.780 --> 01:56.575
Except it's not K7, is it?

01:57.326 --> 02:00.996
Because she just called you Alex.

02:02.081 --> 02:04.959
Mr. Cray, I'm sorry.
We shouldn't have snuck in.

02:05.042 --> 02:06.544
Alex. Alex.

02:07.837 --> 02:09.421
Please understand...

02:11.048 --> 02:13.509
you're not gonna talk
your way out of this.

02:14.093 --> 02:16.804
Not until I know who you really are.

02:17.596 --> 02:18.973
I just love the game.

02:20.057 --> 02:22.226
You've already got the game.

02:23.352 --> 02:25.521
You stole it from me in London,
do you remember?

02:26.230 --> 02:28.899
So if you were just a fan,

02:28.983 --> 02:31.819
you'd still be at home,
hooked to your screen, leveling up.

02:31.902 --> 02:35.906
Instead, you're here,

02:35.990 --> 02:38.868
breaking into my research facility.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.081
Stop lying to me.

02:46.750 --> 02:48.168
[Evelyn] Who are you?

02:48.252 --> 02:49.837
Does he do it a lot?

02:51.088 --> 02:52.089
What?

02:52.882 --> 02:54.425
Kill people like that.

02:55.259 --> 02:56.927
Just answer the question.

02:58.554 --> 03:00.639
Did you write any of it?

03:00.723 --> 03:03.142
- What?
- The code for the game.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.353
- I'm the chief programmer.
- Oh.

03:07.021 --> 03:08.856
Then you should know better.

03:09.607 --> 03:13.277
I saw it. I read it. It's inelegant.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.361
Hmm.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.948
- That's not true.
- Trust me.

03:18.032 --> 03:20.492
Good code is like poetry.

03:21.827 --> 03:25.372
Yours is like a greetings-card limerick.

03:35.633 --> 03:37.009
This is clever.

03:38.010 --> 03:40.346
Your friend's handiwork, I assume?

03:44.058 --> 03:45.059
She's good.

03:46.101 --> 03:47.519
I should hire her.

03:51.523 --> 03:52.650
[sighs]

03:54.401 --> 03:55.653
Who else is involved?

03:56.820 --> 03:58.447
Does your friend know?

04:00.366 --> 04:02.910
Perhaps I'll get more luck talking to her.

04:04.995 --> 04:07.122
She doesn't really like talking.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.418
You didn't just walk in here.

04:12.127 --> 04:13.671
Not without help.

04:14.588 --> 04:15.631
Who else is there?

04:16.674 --> 04:20.386
One of my competitors? Is that it?

04:21.553 --> 04:24.431
Who else knows you're here, Alex?

04:26.225 --> 04:27.643
Go to hell, Damian.

04:36.318 --> 04:38.070
I don't like violence.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.239
I'm not a monster.

04:41.156 --> 04:44.201
But I will hurt you,
if I have to, to get to the truth.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.287
You can do whatever you want to me.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.000
And if you still won't talk...

04:52.292 --> 04:53.502
I'll hurt your friend.

04:57.297 --> 05:00.509
I'll put a bullet in her,
just like I did with Charlie.

05:05.014 --> 05:06.432
Do you understand?

05:08.642 --> 05:10.894
[theme music playing]

05:56.565 --> 05:58.942
[Jones] This is the man
targeting President Walker.

05:59.026 --> 06:03.447
Cray's head of security,
Sean Palmer, alias Thomas Ashton.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.866
There are flights booked
using these identities,

06:05.949 --> 06:07.993
leaving midnight tomorrow.

06:08.077 --> 06:09.745
He wasn't planning on hanging around.

06:10.329 --> 06:11.580
And this?

06:11.663 --> 06:13.290
[Smithers] Aconite derivative.

06:13.373 --> 06:17.461
Heart attack in a bottle.
Essentially, an untraceable neurotoxin.

06:17.544 --> 06:20.506
So this would have played out
like a medical emergency,

06:20.589 --> 06:22.674
not an assassination at all.

06:22.758 --> 06:25.344
And before we got it straight,
if we ever got it straight,

06:25.427 --> 06:27.179
Palmer would be long gone.

06:27.262 --> 06:29.640
It's right out of SCORPIA's playbook.

06:30.265 --> 06:32.101
Someone on the inside.

06:32.643 --> 06:34.770
So the question is,
was he going to be working alone,

06:34.853 --> 06:37.189
or is the other shoe about to drop?

06:40.734 --> 06:42.069
We'll talk to him.

06:49.952 --> 06:51.453
[door closes]

07:05.509 --> 07:07.427
You want to tell me about the dream?

07:07.970 --> 07:09.680
What dream would that be?

07:10.180 --> 07:11.598
Your dream.

07:12.182 --> 07:14.226
The one that costs 6.5 million.

07:17.146 --> 07:19.189
What do you dream about
when you were out there

07:20.149 --> 07:24.570
in the mud or the desert
or wherever they deployed you?

07:26.155 --> 07:31.034
Cold at night, under the stars,
waiting on a dawn raid.

07:36.081 --> 07:37.666
What kept you warm?

07:39.001 --> 07:43.881
To be honest, I always thought
a place in Scotland would be nice.

07:44.882 --> 07:48.010
You know, a quiet life, the outdoors.

07:49.261 --> 07:51.388
Maybe learn a new skill.

07:52.389 --> 07:55.475
I've always been interested
in woodturning.

07:59.396 --> 08:02.733
You don't need 6.5 million
to buy some wood.

08:06.945 --> 08:08.655
[Crawley] We can keep you safe.

08:09.364 --> 08:10.908
You know we can do that.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.618
[Palmer] I can keep myself safe.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.912
Not from SCORPIA.

08:15.746 --> 08:17.247
What's SCORPIA?

08:18.165 --> 08:20.334
[ominous music playing]

08:24.004 --> 08:25.881
Are we sure we've got this right?

08:26.757 --> 08:29.718
Because there are other possibilities.

08:31.428 --> 08:33.180
For example, that he's telling the truth,

08:33.263 --> 08:36.391
and he has absolutely no idea
what we're talking about.

08:37.976 --> 08:39.895
You think he's being set up.

08:41.355 --> 08:44.983
We went looking for an assassin.
And we found one.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.861
We're not looking anymore.

08:47.945 --> 08:50.614
[tense music playing]

09:15.389 --> 09:17.557
Think about what I said.

09:25.816 --> 09:26.817

- Would you excuse me? I'll be right back.

[Tom] No. Really not.

Alex and Kyra are trapped
in the Craystar building in Holland.

What do you mean?
Hang up the phone and call the police.

10:41.350 --> 10:44.019
[Tom] You know what everyone thinks
about Cray. No one's gonna believe me.

10:44.102 --> 10:45.479
Where are you?

10:45.562 --> 10:49.274
At Craystar,
in the hallway, losing my job.

10:49.358 --> 10:51.777
[Tom] You're actually in the building?
That could be good.

10:51.860 --> 10:54.237
We just need to get Cray's attention,
distract him.

10:54.321 --> 10:57.282
How am I supposed to
get his attention and distract him

10:57.366 --> 10:59.201
when he's in a different country?

10:59.284 --> 11:01.370
[Tom] What about Cray's chief programmer?

11:01.453 --> 11:03.205
Kyra said she hacked all her passwords,

11:03.288 --> 11:05.832
that we can post on her timeline,
maybe we can use that.

You've got to do something.

11:15.133 --> 11:18.470
Okay. Okay.
What's the name of the programmer, Tom?

- Where are you now?
- I'm in the chief programmer's office.

13:29.643 --> 13:32.062
I've got her laptop,
but I don't have much time.

13:32.145 --> 13:36.525
I've got e-mail, web, the works.
Didn't even need a password.

13:36.608 --> 13:38.276
Yeah, told you Kyra had it covered.

13:38.360 --> 13:39.486
So, what's the plan?

13:39.569 --> 13:42.280
Alex said the game's
all Cray cares about, right?

13:42.364 --> 13:44.032
- That he's obsessed?
- [Tom] Yeah.

13:44.115 --> 13:45.659
Well, that's what we're gonna use.

13:54.751 --> 13:56.419
I'm getting his attention.

We need to go over the

- What's going on, Jack?
- Nothing.

I went to the bathroom,
and I must have taken a wrong turn.

We should get back in there.

You wanted to know
how the boy knew Charlie.

14:43.633 --> 14:45.635
I think I have the answer.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.846
Looked at all common denominators.

14:53.810 --> 14:55.186
Can it be that simple?

14:56.521 --> 14:59.274
All this
because I hurt his friend's father?

15:00.525 --> 15:04.613
That means he's nothing.
He's not working for anyone. We're clear.

It's gone to all press outlets.

- [yelling] Who sent it?
- I did.

I mean, that's how it looks.

How is that possible?

16:34.035 --> 16:35.036
It's not.

16:35.120 --> 16:39.332
I don't understand it.
My security protocols are bulletproof.

16:43.712 --> 16:45.380
Clearly, you made a mistake.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.258
Which makes me wonder...

16:49.759 --> 16:51.469
if you've made other mistakes.

16:51.553 --> 16:53.596
I don't. I haven't.

16:55.849 --> 16:59.018
This was coordinated. Deliberate.

Whoever those kids are,
they're working with someone else,

17:01.604 --> 17:03.732
and that someone else
was in our offices in London.

17:03.815 --> 17:04.941
This isn't me.

17:05.942 --> 17:09.404
This was someone trying to
compromise the launch. It has to be.

17:16.286 --> 17:19.164
So, what do you suggest we do about it?

17:19.247 --> 17:22.375
Talk it down. Right now, in person.

17:22.459 --> 17:26.045
Tell them it's a hoax.
If they see you, they know it's true.

17:27.213 --> 17:28.214
Hmm.

17:31.509 --> 17:32.510
Talk it down.

17:36.514 --> 17:38.516
Yeah, I can do that.

17:46.316 --> 17:47.442
[announcer on PA] Attention.

17:47.525 --> 17:51.237
We are temporarily
closing the building to visitors.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.991
Uh... we have to postpone.

17:55.074 --> 17:58.328
They're asking all non-personnel
to leave the building immediately.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.412
How come?

17:59.496 --> 18:02.123
Seems there's been a security breach.

18:02.207 --> 18:04.459
Somebody's tried
to sabotage the game launch.

18:06.294 --> 18:07.754
Sorry.

18:14.552 --> 18:16.679
- [Kyra] I need tools.
- [Alex] We don't have tools.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.890
- [Kyra] What do we have?
- Zip.

18:20.016 --> 18:23.478
- Shoelaces.
- No, no, that's no good. I...

18:23.561 --> 18:27.899
I think this is the trip.
I need to short across both of these.

18:27.982 --> 18:29.484
I need something...

18:31.486 --> 18:34.280
Something steel, a good conductor.

18:35.740 --> 18:37.325
For getting out of locked rooms.

18:43.873 --> 18:44.999
[door unlocks]

18:53.216 --> 18:55.593
Hi. This is Damian Cray.

18:55.677 --> 18:58.429
And I'm here to tell you
that no matter what you've heard,

18:58.513 --> 19:01.432
tomorrow, the world is going to change.

19:01.891 --> 19:05.103
- Jack Starbright.
- Now, a different story has gone viral

19:05.186 --> 19:08.314
saying the launch of Feathered Serpent 2
has been canceled.

19:08.940 --> 19:12.694
That announcement was a hoax, a fake.

19:14.070 --> 19:17.991
It was purported to have come
from one of my programming team.

19:18.074 --> 19:19.325
It did not.

19:20.326 --> 19:23.621
It was the work
of some unknown saboteur...

19:24.205 --> 19:25.623
Looks like Cray's busy.

19:26.749 --> 19:28.459
We are committed to bringing you...

19:28.543 --> 19:31.045
- Have you got the code?
- Uh, just a moment.

19:37.719 --> 19:39.679
- Kyra?
- [Kyra] I know. Just a moment.

19:41.472 --> 19:46.561
The only thing the game needs is you,
the player.

19:48.271 --> 19:51.649
We assure you, that e-mail was a fake.

19:52.233 --> 19:54.736
Feathered Serpent 2 will launch tomorrow,

19:55.361 --> 19:57.488
and the world will be
a better place because of it.

19:58.323 --> 19:59.407
Nothing can stop that.

19:59.490 --> 20:01.659
- Got it.
- You have my word.

20:11.711 --> 20:14.964
- What do you think this is?
- Alex, we've got the code. Let's go.

Jack?

20:36.819 --> 20:38.571
- Are they out?
- [Tom] Not yet.

20:41.866 --> 20:43.701
What do you think happened in there?

20:45.244 --> 20:47.121
- No idea.
- Yeah?

20:47.997 --> 20:49.832
- You sure?
- Yeah.

20:51.417 --> 20:55.213
You were out of the room a long time.
Getting lost.

20:57.882 --> 21:00.718
And then, it all kicked off.

21:03.179 --> 21:05.598
- Did you see anything?
- No.

21:07.141 --> 21:08.226
Not a thing.

21:09.060 --> 21:11.187
- I'm just gonna, um...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:11.938 --> 21:14.941
[ominous music playing]

21:32.542 --> 21:33.584
[Cray] Check the terminal.

21:37.213 --> 21:39.048
[Evelyn] They made a file transfer.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.300
It's a lot of data.

21:49.934 --> 21:51.269
It's the game code.

21:56.691 --> 21:58.067
I think it's time we...

22:00.319 --> 22:01.612
Time we what?

22:04.115 --> 22:07.076
Mr. Cray, what is it? What's happened?

22:08.745 --> 22:11.289
[alarm blaring]

22:23.634 --> 22:25.511
[Cray] All security inside.

22:27.889 --> 22:29.390
I don't want any witnesses.

22:30.183 --> 22:32.727
Confirm the game
is ready to launch as planned.

24:53.576 --> 24:55.661
- Are we okay?
- I don't know.

25:09.926 --> 25:11.177
It can't see us, right?

25:11.260 --> 25:12.261

Unit control, imaging systems to infrared.

There they are.

26:28.337 --> 26:29.547
Here, mate!

26:30.423 --> 26:31.632

In here.

- Drone.

27:10.254 --> 27:12.381
Thermal interference. You lost them.

27:13.674 --> 27:14.842
No.

27:31.233 --> 27:33.611
- You think he gave up?
- [Alex] I don't know.

- Did you see where it went?
- No.

There you are.

There's something else
I want you to do for me.

31:22.715 --> 31:25.509
- Did we get it?
- Yeah.

31:25.593 --> 31:27.803
- All of it.
- The entire game code.

31:29.346 --> 31:30.973
So we can go home?

31:31.056 --> 31:32.057
Yeah.

31:37.313 --> 31:41.692
What you did with the drone,
protecting me like that...

31:41.775 --> 31:43.027
Yeah. Um...

31:45.154 --> 31:46.322
I tripped.

31:47.615 --> 31:48.616
Right.

to school tomorrow.

I told her I was fine,
but she says it's important.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.989
[Yassen] Your mother sounds very sensible.

32:29.073 --> 32:30.074
She is.

32:33.369 --> 32:35.746
I have the results of your dad's MRI.

Can we go somewhere and talk?

32:39.625 --> 32:40.626
Sure.

Let me hold this for you.

32:59.478 --> 33:01.980
[man 1] Air Force One,
this is Calfield Tower.

33:02.523 --> 33:04.942
Come left to heading 2-4-0.

33:05.025 --> 33:09.238
- 2-1-0 degrees.
- [man 2] Left 2-4-0...

Runway 2-4 in sight.

33:17.955 --> 33:20.499
[Jones] I've been looking all night
in case we missed anything,

33:20.582 --> 33:23.919
but everything points to Palmer.
There's nothing else.

33:26.672 --> 33:28.632
Maybe we got the right man after all.

33:29.258 --> 33:33.345
[man 2] Calfield Tower, Air Force One,
final 2-4 for landing.

33:33.429 --> 33:35.931
Calfield Tower, you are cleared to land.

33:36.724 --> 33:39.268
- [man 2] Copy, Calfield.
- What about the accounts?

33:40.227 --> 33:41.228
Hm?

33:42.271 --> 33:46.525
SCORPIA could have routed that six and
a half million from anywhere in the world.

33:46.608 --> 33:49.653
Why use an old bank account
with their fingerprints?

33:49.737 --> 33:51.655
One of which we can trace.

[cell phone vibrating]

33:57.703 --> 33:58.954
Mrs. Jones.

33:59.872 --> 34:00.914

34:09.715 --> 34:11.759
Welcome to the United Kingdom.

Come in.

34:33.947 --> 34:37.326
Dan. Shame about the Cray situation.

34:38.035 --> 34:41.288
Now, what can I do for you?

34:43.165 --> 34:46.960
I'd never normally
go behind a colleague's back.

34:47.628 --> 34:50.130
But this has gotten out of control.

34:51.256 --> 34:55.469
There's something
I think you need to know about Jack.

34:57.429 --> 34:58.597
[Jones] Thank you.

35:22.454 --> 35:23.705
What are they doing here?

=Without Tom and Kyra, I'd be dead by now,
and you'd know nothing.

35:30.212 --> 35:31.964
Know nothing about what?

35:32.047 --> 35:36.260
We have a decrypted,
full version of Damian Cray's new game.

35:36.343 --> 35:37.845
The one that launches tonight.

35:38.470 --> 35:41.306
- Alex, I don't have time for games.
- [Alex] It's not a game.

35:41.390 --> 35:43.058
[Kyra] The game is just a shell.

35:43.141 --> 35:44.351
Like a Trojan Horse.

35:44.852 --> 35:47.479
I've only scratched the surface
but there's gigabytes of code

35:47.563 --> 35:50.274
and hardly any of it
is to do with game mechanics.

35:51.066 --> 35:54.194
- Right. So, what is it to do with?
- [Alex] We don't know yet.

35:54.278 --> 35:57.906
But what we do know is Damien Cray
murdered his own PR guy,

35:57.990 --> 36:00.200
Charlie Roper, right in front of us,

36:00.284 --> 36:01.785
and then tried to kill us as well.

36:03.745 --> 36:06.707
Damian Cray
is planning something terrible.

36:06.790 --> 36:10.002
The countdown isn't for a game launch,
it's for something much worse.

36:10.085 --> 36:11.670
And he has SCORPIA helping him.

36:16.633 --> 36:18.218
Do you believe us?

36:22.139 --> 36:23.140
Yes.

36:23.932 --> 36:26.143
Then you need to get this to Smithers,
right now.

36:27.060 --> 36:28.604
And you've been working on this?

36:29.271 --> 36:32.065
- Then you're with me.
- No. I don't think so.

36:32.149 --> 36:33.317
[Alex] Kyra.

36:33.400 --> 36:36.737
Smithers is a good guy.
He'll listen to you.

36:36.820 --> 36:39.531
Plus, you're like 15 steps ahead
of the curve right now.

36:41.366 --> 36:42.367
Okay.

36:43.160 --> 36:44.161
Hurry.

36:49.833 --> 36:50.834
Mate.

36:51.543 --> 36:52.544
It's okay.

36:53.879 --> 36:54.880
You did it.

36:58.175 --> 37:00.928
Maybe you should go see Sabina.

37:01.970 --> 37:04.514
You know, let her know
everything's gonna be okay.

37:04.598 --> 37:06.266
- You seen Steph?
- Yeah.

37:06.850 --> 37:08.727
She wanted to know
where the hell we've been

37:08.810 --> 37:10.562
and, uh, what all this was about.

37:14.566 --> 37:15.901
[Alex] What did you tell her?

37:16.902 --> 37:19.488
"Alex is doing an electronics project."

37:19.571 --> 37:22.074
Yeah.
I'm really running out of excuses here.

37:23.367 --> 37:24.618
Yours, later?

37:25.202 --> 37:27.579
Make sure Mrs. Jones
and that lot are doing their bit?

37:28.872 --> 37:29.998
Definitely.

37:44.137 --> 37:47.307
I'm not gonna ask you
what you did or didn't do.

37:47.724 --> 37:52.020
But is there anything you can say
to change my mind?

37:53.689 --> 37:55.983
I was helping to save the world?

37:59.069 --> 38:00.237
Forget that.

38:01.738 --> 38:04.324
I joined you guys because you were small.

38:05.117 --> 38:07.494
Because you were looking out
for the underdog.

38:07.577 --> 38:08.787
And somehow,

38:08.870 --> 38:12.958
we ended up doing corporate acquisitions
for a multi-billionaire.

38:13.458 --> 38:15.377
And that's not me.

38:17.087 --> 38:21.425
If somebody did do something,

38:22.217 --> 38:24.761
even if that something looks bad...

38:26.388 --> 38:29.433
maybe they had their reasons.

38:30.851 --> 38:32.853
And maybe their reasons were good.

38:34.062 --> 38:37.315
You should gather your belongings
and leave immediately.

38:39.443 --> 38:42.446
[indistinct chatter]

38:53.790 --> 38:54.791
Jack.

38:55.834 --> 39:01.006
I just wanted you to know
this wasn't personal.

39:01.590 --> 39:05.135
No. Clearly it never was.

39:27.699 --> 39:33.038
It is no understatement to say
that an entire generation of Americans

39:33.121 --> 39:35.957
have been lost to the opioid crisis

39:36.041 --> 39:38.710
currently crippling our country.

to this crisis...

[ringing continues]

40:08.740 --> 40:09.741
Hello, Alex.

40:10.617 --> 40:12.160
You have something that's mine.

40:13.120 --> 40:15.956
If you're talking about the game,
it's too late. It's already gone.

40:16.039 --> 40:19.876
No, no, no. Something else.
Something you took from me.

40:24.923 --> 40:27.592
- You mean this?
- Exactly.

40:28.844 --> 40:30.262
I'd like it back, please.

40:30.971 --> 40:33.181
- Well, that's not going to happen.
- Ugh.

40:33.265 --> 40:34.975
I knew you were gonna say that.

40:35.809 --> 40:40.105
But it's very important to me.
And I really want it back.

40:40.188 --> 40:45.110
So I took something
that I think is important to you.

40:47.571 --> 40:50.031
Pick up this phone, Alex. Keep it on.

40:50.115 --> 40:52.576
Follow my instructions on where to go,

40:52.659 --> 40:55.120
The camera will watch you
every step of the way.

40:55.203 --> 40:59.958
Deviate from the instructions,
call anyone, tell anyone...

41:00.584 --> 41:04.129
Well, you can imagine what will happen.

41:06.298 --> 41:09.551
Ah-ah-ah. No. Alex,
I know what you're doing.

41:10.635 --> 41:14.139
You're trying to think
your way around this. Don't.

41:15.182 --> 41:16.266
Pick up the phone,

41:16.349 --> 41:19.686
follow the instructions
and bring me what's mine,

41:20.312 --> 41:25.483
and you and Sabina here
will live to see tomorrow.
