WEBVTT

00:06.167 --> 00:08.102
I told you, I'm fine.

00:08.169 --> 00:09.736
I feel much stronger today

00:09.837 --> 00:11.405
and I'd feel much better still

00:11.539 --> 00:13.440
if I were at home surrounded by my things.

00:13.608 --> 00:16.410
Well, I'd feel better if
I could keep watch on you.

00:16.611 --> 00:20.879
There could be some latent
symptoms caused by the malaria.

00:20.881 --> 00:24.183
Fever, chills.

00:24.385 --> 00:27.420
Take a pinch of this at the
first sign of any symptoms.

00:27.421 --> 00:29.122
It's quinine.

00:29.356 --> 00:32.525
Oh, now all I need do is lay
in a stock of gin and limes

00:32.592 --> 00:34.160
and I can make a party of it.

00:42.636 --> 00:45.004
Worry about your other patients, John.

00:45.071 --> 00:47.239
I'll look in on you later.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:09.095 --> 01:10.428
One second.

01:18.571 --> 01:20.539
Yes?

01:53.038 --> 01:54.486
In the last century,

01:54.487 --> 01:56.655
neurologists have revolutionized

01:56.789 --> 02:00.491
our understanding of the human brain.

02:00.626 --> 02:03.061
Using electric currents, they discovered

02:03.229 --> 02:05.796
that precise points of
the brain can be stimulated

02:05.898 --> 02:08.332
to reveal their specific functions.

02:09.869 --> 02:13.003
Seated in front of you
is Mr. Sidney Carton.

02:13.172 --> 02:15.706
Mr. Carton was recently
involved in an accident

02:15.875 --> 02:18.776
that resulted in the loss
of the top of his cranium.

02:18.978 --> 02:23.880
Fortunately, for the benefit
of our experiments today,

02:23.982 --> 02:26.749
his brain was left unharmed.

02:38.696 --> 02:40.796
I will now deliver small currents

02:40.898 --> 02:43.999
into the patient's brain to demonstrate.

02:44.234 --> 02:48.537
We only have a vague idea of
what happens in any given area.

02:48.705 --> 02:51.107
As you know, the brain
itself feels no pain,

02:51.208 --> 02:53.875
so Mr. Carton won't feel a thing.

03:16.365 --> 03:20.168
Electricity can also affect our emotions.

03:22.071 --> 03:23.804
I will now demonstrate.

03:47.329 --> 03:50.464
Stop. Stop.

03:50.465 --> 03:52.699
Stop it.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.537
And what about desire?

03:58.573 --> 04:01.308
Mr. Carton is a morphine addict.

04:01.443 --> 04:03.677
He injects himself multiple times a day.

04:03.845 --> 04:07.881
But for the past 24 hours,
he has been denied the drug.

04:18.793 --> 04:21.894
As you can see, his need
for the morphine is immense.

04:45.152 --> 04:47.653
Other than discharging electricity,

04:47.687 --> 04:49.855
this device, a rheoscope,

04:49.856 --> 04:51.390
can detect it.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.894
Using it,

04:56.063 --> 04:59.564
I hope to identify the
region of Mr. Carton's brain

04:59.665 --> 05:02.066
that is stimulated by the morphine.

05:44.076 --> 05:45.709
Gentlemen...

05:48.246 --> 05:51.382
it seems that X marks the spot.

06:29.052 --> 06:30.687
What's the matter with you?

06:30.721 --> 06:33.756
I... I don't know.

06:33.824 --> 06:35.997
Have you eaten anything today?

06:35.998 --> 06:37.899
It's her time of the month.

06:37.900 --> 06:39.901
Cramps?

06:39.969 --> 06:41.636
You having your monthly?

06:41.637 --> 06:43.737
How old are you?

06:43.738 --> 06:45.839
18.

06:46.074 --> 06:48.876
Nobody's properly taught you
about the functions of your body?

06:50.445 --> 06:52.312
All right.

06:52.447 --> 06:54.114
I'll tell you what you're going to do.

06:54.248 --> 06:57.084
You beg 20 cents off one of the nuns,

06:57.185 --> 06:59.153
walk if you can to the pharmacy.

06:59.354 --> 07:02.589
Ask the man there to sell you
a bottle of cannabis indica.

07:02.624 --> 07:04.424
Cannabis indica.

07:04.526 --> 07:06.659
I'll write it down for you so you remember.

07:06.827 --> 07:10.462
Why not some hashish,
too, while she's at it?

07:10.598 --> 07:13.866
Are you fit enough to continue with work?

07:15.669 --> 07:17.136
Yes, Sister.

07:18.372 --> 07:20.206
At the very least, give the poor girl leave

07:20.273 --> 07:22.274
to fetch a couple aspirin.

07:22.376 --> 07:25.011
Aspirin will not cure God's will.

07:25.045 --> 07:26.813
It's the curse of Eve.

07:26.981 --> 07:29.849
The curse of Eve is to
bring forth children in pain,

07:29.950 --> 07:31.918
not to suffer menstrual cramps.

07:31.952 --> 07:34.285
Much the same thing.

07:34.353 --> 07:35.887
And I'll thank the likes of you

07:36.022 --> 07:38.223
not to instruct me in matters of theology.

07:38.357 --> 07:40.926
I was just trying to help the poor girl.

07:41.060 --> 07:44.763
Like you helped all those unborn babies?

07:44.998 --> 07:48.867
Don't let me catch you talking
to these girls again, Dolan.

07:49.002 --> 07:52.170
Did you hear me, all the rest of you?

07:52.304 --> 07:55.473
This woman is the worst kind of sinner...

07:55.508 --> 07:57.175
an infanticide.

07:57.243 --> 07:59.510
And you will not speak to her.

07:59.579 --> 08:01.812
Not so much as a good morning.

08:01.880 --> 08:04.348
Unless you don't want to eat.

08:23.201 --> 08:25.168
Henry, this is inspired.

08:25.402 --> 08:27.904
Imagine the fortune you'd make
showing this on the Bowery.

08:28.105 --> 08:32.541
You've single-handedly brought
self-abuse into the 20th century.

08:32.543 --> 08:34.277
Pun intended.

08:34.378 --> 08:35.779
What I don't understand

08:35.913 --> 08:37.647
is why you didn't jump in there yourself.

08:37.748 --> 08:41.583
Well, somebody had to crank the camera.

08:43.220 --> 08:45.088
I volunteer.

09:39.908 --> 09:41.909
What'll it be, sir?

09:41.944 --> 09:45.213
Care for a White Lion?

09:45.314 --> 09:49.116
Or perhaps a White Tiger's Milk.

09:49.185 --> 09:51.385
Just a couple of whiskeys.

09:57.259 --> 09:59.126
I'm sorry, Bertie.

09:59.294 --> 10:01.863
I couldn't think of
anywhere else to take you.

10:01.930 --> 10:04.798
No, no. It's a novelty.

10:04.867 --> 10:06.800
My father will be scandalized.

10:18.213 --> 10:21.281
So, what is it that you
wanted to talk to me about?

10:23.151 --> 10:25.352
I've had some bad news.

10:25.453 --> 10:27.688
My mother has laryngeal cancer.

10:30.358 --> 10:32.426
I'm sorry, Bertie.

10:32.460 --> 10:34.261
That's terrible.

10:36.531 --> 10:38.599
What course are you considering?

10:40.034 --> 10:43.370
I thought perhaps that
you might have encountered

10:43.538 --> 10:48.776
more pioneering procedures
during your years abroad.

10:48.910 --> 10:50.977
Have you consulted with
Dr. Zinberg about this?

10:51.213 --> 10:54.448
No, Dr. Zinberg is the kind of
man who wears both suspenders

10:54.549 --> 10:56.817
and a belt, if you take my meaning.

10:56.918 --> 10:58.452
He would never approve a procedure

10:58.687 --> 11:01.422
that hadn't passed years of
rigorous laboratory experimentation

11:01.423 --> 11:04.291
and peer review.

11:04.492 --> 11:07.927
I have to say I feel like
it's because he's a Jew.

11:08.061 --> 11:10.162
I believe being a universally despised race

11:10.331 --> 11:12.335
has stiffened their
resolve to never act rashly

11:12.336 --> 11:15.200
and risk being thought a failure
in the eyes of a hostile world.

11:19.273 --> 11:22.675
Some months ago, I read a
paper coauthored by Pierre Curie

11:22.876 --> 11:25.812
on the treatment of
malignant tumors using radium

11:25.912 --> 11:28.380
and other radioactive substances.

11:28.515 --> 11:30.516
I could translate it from the French

11:30.684 --> 11:33.453
if you could find a copy of it somewhere.

11:34.788 --> 11:37.490
Bertie, you smell just like McSorley's Bar.

11:37.591 --> 11:39.792
Have you been in a saloon tonight?

11:40.026 --> 11:42.266
How do you know what
McSorley's smells like, huh?

11:42.396 --> 11:44.430
I didn't think they
permitted women in there.

11:44.598 --> 11:46.799
I have ways of getting into places.

11:50.271 --> 11:52.638
Bertie, how on earth did you do that?

11:52.773 --> 11:55.508
Well, I, too, have ways
of getting into places.

11:58.544 --> 12:00.445
You find anything?

12:00.647 --> 12:04.650
No, but you're still researching
adrenaline, aren't you?

12:04.651 --> 12:06.918
Yes. Why?

12:07.153 --> 12:09.821
Because here's a paper about it
from the University of Krakow.

12:12.825 --> 12:14.593
You read Polish?

12:15.728 --> 12:17.428
Yeah.

12:17.430 --> 12:18.897
Very impressive.

12:18.898 --> 12:20.632
Ah, voila.

12:20.733 --> 12:22.200
The French Academy of Sciences,

12:22.234 --> 12:24.135
December 1900.

12:26.739 --> 12:28.673
This is it.

12:28.841 --> 12:31.910
So how often do you engage
in criminal activity?

12:31.911 --> 12:33.845
Not often.

12:33.946 --> 12:35.713
Please don't tell my mother.

12:35.948 --> 12:37.988
If she found out that I'd
become a second-story man,

12:38.083 --> 12:39.993
she'd be heartbroken.

12:58.470 --> 13:00.638
Henry Robertson.

13:01.640 --> 13:03.206
What?

13:08.512 --> 13:10.580
Yeah, let me call you back.

13:26.129 --> 13:27.764
I'll go in the back.

13:35.072 --> 13:37.440
- What happened?
- Dynamite explosion.

13:37.541 --> 13:39.508
Subway excavation on Park Avenue.

13:39.643 --> 13:40.977
- How many injured?
- Don't know.

13:41.144 --> 13:42.984
They're still pulling
bodies out of the ground.

13:43.012 --> 13:45.380
But it ain't gonna end any time soon.

13:45.482 --> 13:47.148
Thack, where should we put them?

13:47.350 --> 13:49.517
- The wards?
- No, we'll need them for recovery.

13:49.686 --> 13:52.220
Fetch every operating table in the hospital

13:52.389 --> 13:54.422
and get them into the
theater. Help him, Edwards.

13:54.557 --> 13:56.157
No, I should stay and sort the patients.

13:56.192 --> 13:58.627
No, Nurse Elkins is more than qualified.

13:58.661 --> 13:59.861
Any questions?

14:00.029 --> 14:01.796
Should I use the hallways
as a waiting room?

14:01.997 --> 14:04.865
Good. Anything else, just
make it up as you go along.

14:07.736 --> 14:09.503
Yeah, up front. You're driving.

14:09.605 --> 14:12.607
You're gonna let me drive?

14:12.608 --> 14:14.075
I'm staying here.

14:14.242 --> 14:16.402
Someone's got to ride roughshod
over the likes of them.

14:16.412 --> 14:18.523
- I don't believe it.
- Ambulances coming in from all over.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.147
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:20.248 --> 14:21.681
Get the fuck out of here, man.

14:21.783 --> 14:23.650
How in the hell do you drive this thing?

14:26.086 --> 14:28.688
- So what do we have?
- His pelvis is shattered.

14:28.856 --> 14:31.390
Need to resect the gut
and set the bone somehow.

14:31.459 --> 14:33.192
There's no time. Splint the hips,

14:33.360 --> 14:34.961
staunch the bleeds, and
shove the rest inside.

14:35.062 --> 14:36.422
I don't need your advice, Edwards.

14:36.464 --> 14:38.632
He's right, Everett. Just do what he says.

14:40.967 --> 14:42.607
How deeply embedded do you think this is?

14:42.702 --> 14:44.503
Hopefully not as far as the lungs.

14:44.604 --> 14:47.039
I don't see any external trauma,

14:47.106 --> 14:49.341
but stand by just in case.

15:01.153 --> 15:03.554
Lung's collapsed.

15:03.656 --> 15:05.657
- Scalpel.
- Bring him in.

15:09.895 --> 15:11.663
Trocar.

15:23.508 --> 15:25.141
Dr. Thackery.

15:27.078 --> 15:28.979
- You got it?
- Dr. Thackery.

15:31.916 --> 15:33.616
Okay, let's clean him up,

15:33.651 --> 15:35.485
see how deep they are.

15:45.796 --> 15:47.905
Don't... don't pull it
out. You'll bleed to death.

15:47.906 --> 15:49.899
We're gonna get you right into surgery.

15:51.702 --> 15:54.536
10 grains of morphine.

15:54.638 --> 15:56.672
That compound fracture can wait.

15:58.475 --> 16:00.676
Let's get some pressure under his head.

16:04.614 --> 16:07.782
Nurse Beckman. This is Henry Robertson.

16:07.884 --> 16:09.918
Hello. Look, we have an emergency.

16:10.020 --> 16:11.786
We need all nurses here immediately.

16:11.888 --> 16:14.256
You live with Nurse Nash, don't you?

16:14.324 --> 16:15.557
No need to get changed.

16:15.658 --> 16:17.392
Report directly to Nurse Taylor.

16:17.527 --> 16:19.227
She'll tell you where you're most needed.

16:19.395 --> 16:22.230
And don't bother with
normal admissions protocol.

16:22.464 --> 16:27.000
Just sign them all in as John
Doe and we'll sort it out later.

16:27.202 --> 16:31.072
Nurse Taylor, I have four
more sets of hands for you.

16:31.073 --> 16:33.006
Orderly.

16:33.075 --> 16:34.542
We're out of beds and gurneys.

16:34.676 --> 16:37.612
I need you to find every couch, bench,

16:37.746 --> 16:39.913
chair, anything you can lay a patient on.

16:39.981 --> 16:41.549
No room is off-limits.

16:48.423 --> 16:50.063
Where the fuck do you think you're going?

16:50.258 --> 16:52.525
Out of my way, Cleary. I need to
see a man about my carting fees.

16:52.660 --> 16:54.594
- Ah... how many?
- That was the fourth.

16:54.762 --> 16:56.722
And they were all still
breathing when I got here.

16:56.764 --> 16:59.499
Your hospital administrator owes
me a total of four simoleons.

16:59.667 --> 17:01.433
- Now will you kindly let me pass?
- No.

17:01.535 --> 17:03.369
But I'll tell you what I will do.

17:03.503 --> 17:05.337
I'll take your name down and I'll make sure

17:05.539 --> 17:07.772
that Mr. Barrow's aware
of the Knick's debt to you.

17:08.007 --> 17:10.942
I'm sure he'll get around to
paying it in three weeks or so.

17:10.944 --> 17:12.844
Three weeks?

17:13.012 --> 17:16.648
Or you can have your
money right now from me.

17:16.683 --> 17:18.384
What's the catch?

17:18.518 --> 17:21.986
The catch is I'm offering two bits per.

17:22.020 --> 17:23.921
Two bits per body.

17:24.089 --> 17:26.491
So instead of waiting three
weeks for the $4 I'm owed,

17:26.625 --> 17:28.760
you're offering to pay me $1 right now?

17:28.794 --> 17:30.828
Cash on the barrelhead.

17:40.905 --> 17:43.307
Help me. Help me.

17:43.374 --> 17:45.409
You've got to help me.

17:45.577 --> 17:48.445
- Take him straight to surgery.
- But I...

17:48.546 --> 17:50.914
I have a wife and a little daughter.

17:51.882 --> 17:53.850
Dr. Thackery.

17:55.653 --> 17:58.054
Finish up and dress the wound.

17:58.055 --> 17:59.589
Yes, Doctor.

18:13.237 --> 18:15.571
Put him under.

18:15.773 --> 18:18.241
I can't go slicing around.
He's losing too much blood.

18:18.275 --> 18:19.775
The X-ray is full.

18:19.810 --> 18:21.510
No time for that.

18:40.630 --> 18:42.564
What are you doing?

18:42.665 --> 18:44.899
I'm gonna use this wire as a probe.

18:46.636 --> 18:49.036
If it comes in contact with any metal,

18:49.138 --> 18:52.639
then it'll close the circuit

18:52.775 --> 18:55.076
and we should be able to hear it.

18:58.881 --> 19:01.015
Come with me.

19:01.016 --> 19:03.017
Towel clamp.

19:25.707 --> 19:27.474
I hear something.

19:27.542 --> 19:29.777
- A crackle.
- Forceps.

19:51.999 --> 19:54.534
Ambulances have begun arriving less often.

19:54.535 --> 19:56.303
Good.

19:56.503 --> 19:59.973
I had a look around the wards
and they're full to bursting.

20:00.108 --> 20:01.974
Just what I wanted to talk with you about.

20:02.075 --> 20:03.876
Have you any thoughts as to how much

20:04.044 --> 20:06.111
we should charge the
subway construction company?

20:09.383 --> 20:10.817
Charge them nothing.

20:12.386 --> 20:14.086
Beg your pardon?

20:14.221 --> 20:16.956
This is nothing less than a civic duty.

20:17.057 --> 20:18.958
We won't take a penny for it.

20:19.025 --> 20:20.426
It would be dishonorable.

20:21.795 --> 20:24.497
Nobody makes a profit here today.

20:48.388 --> 20:50.822
Quite a day.

20:50.924 --> 20:55.094
I for one am glad to see it end.

20:55.262 --> 20:58.763
And now we come to the
hour of our settlement.

20:58.832 --> 21:02.534
That's 124 patients in total.

21:02.635 --> 21:05.137
A new milestone for the Knick.

21:05.272 --> 21:08.339
And myself personally, I don't mind saying.

21:08.474 --> 21:11.142
Cleary, you can't honestly
expect me to believe

21:11.277 --> 21:14.713
you carted 124 patients here by yourself.

21:16.182 --> 21:18.650
Let's just say I made a little arrangement

21:18.685 --> 21:20.552
with the other fellas.

21:20.620 --> 21:22.053
How much did you pay them?

21:22.087 --> 21:24.623
Two bits a head.

21:24.657 --> 21:26.791
Not a bad return.

21:26.859 --> 21:31.295
$124 from a $31 investment.

21:33.265 --> 21:36.134
Unfortunately, I think you'll find

21:36.202 --> 21:38.336
you squandered your capital.

21:40.539 --> 21:42.139
The fuck are you talking about?

21:43.775 --> 21:45.735
The president of the
hospital's board of directors

21:45.844 --> 21:49.914
has decreed that no one will
profit from today's calamity.

21:50.048 --> 21:53.050
And that, I'm afraid, includes you, Cleary.

21:54.619 --> 21:56.053
If you have any complaints,

21:56.187 --> 21:58.188
you can take it up with Henry Robertson.

22:02.394 --> 22:03.994
Fuck me sideways.

22:13.071 --> 22:15.605
Hey, sorry I'm late.

22:17.041 --> 22:19.376
How are you feeling?

22:19.510 --> 22:21.278
Rather anxious, to tell you the truth.

22:21.379 --> 22:23.180
I've been tossing in bed for hours.

22:28.386 --> 22:31.588
Here's laudanum.

22:31.589 --> 22:33.156
Help you sleep.

22:33.258 --> 22:35.725
Three drops in a glass of water.

22:37.495 --> 22:39.662
Is there anything I can help you with?

22:39.730 --> 22:42.099
Just the bedclothes, please.

23:00.384 --> 23:02.551
Put that away, John.

23:02.553 --> 23:03.886
Please.

23:05.523 --> 23:07.991
- Abby...
- Not here.

24:00.276 --> 24:02.177
The only thing I can
think to do for her now

24:02.311 --> 24:04.379
is to help her sleep through the pain.

24:05.914 --> 24:08.316
She could never abide laudanum, you know...

24:10.987 --> 24:13.020
but I don't know what else to do.

24:15.257 --> 24:19.694
Dad, I've been studying a paper

24:19.828 --> 24:22.029
that was published this past year in Paris

24:22.164 --> 24:24.532
about radium and the treatment of cancer.

24:26.102 --> 24:27.368
It's largely untested.

24:27.369 --> 24:29.203
Do it.

25:07.308 --> 25:09.909
Well, well.

25:10.011 --> 25:11.845
Now what do you have to say?

25:13.181 --> 25:15.582
I bet you'd feel the prize booby today

25:15.750 --> 25:18.685
if I had let you invest
in that subway scheme.

25:28.062 --> 25:30.162
What ships are expected today?

25:30.230 --> 25:32.665
The Phoenicia out of Hamburg

25:32.766 --> 25:35.100
and the L'Aquitaine out of Le Havre.

25:35.235 --> 25:37.470
The L'Aquitaine was expected last week.

25:37.571 --> 25:40.640
She suffered mechanical difficulties.

25:40.707 --> 25:43.509
Needs a month in dry dock.

25:43.677 --> 25:47.513
The entire fleet needs a month in dry dock.

25:47.681 --> 25:50.015
Well, what about all the new ships, Henry?

25:50.117 --> 25:51.884
What the hell is taking so long?

25:51.952 --> 25:53.551
They'd already be seaworthy

25:53.720 --> 25:56.388
if you built them when I first told you to.

25:56.522 --> 25:59.191
Now in order to keep the old ships afloat,

25:59.425 --> 26:02.995
I've had to dip into the funds we
borrowed to finish the new ones.

26:03.196 --> 26:05.563
You can imagine how we
stand with our creditors.

26:09.069 --> 26:11.303
Now is not the time to be timid.

26:12.872 --> 26:16.275
We should sell at auction
every last rusty bucket

26:16.409 --> 26:19.477
and put the money into new technologies.

26:19.479 --> 26:21.413
Such as the subway?

26:22.982 --> 26:25.684
150 wounded, six dead.

26:25.784 --> 26:27.752
The city will be settling lawsuits

26:27.886 --> 26:30.588
from now until the day we can fly to work.

26:32.891 --> 26:37.295
Let me remind you what
Baron Rothschild said.

26:37.563 --> 26:41.098
The time to invest is when there's
blood running in the streets.

26:53.245 --> 26:54.745
I need to get going.

26:54.746 --> 26:56.447
Of course.

27:01.153 --> 27:03.387
Thank you, Abby.

27:03.421 --> 27:04.722
For everything.

27:04.789 --> 27:07.624
Well, you cure my syphilis,

27:07.659 --> 27:09.426
I make you breakfast.

27:09.461 --> 27:11.094
Seems like a fair trade.

27:11.196 --> 27:13.497
What will I have to do for dinner?

27:18.636 --> 27:20.536
Sorry.

27:21.472 --> 27:23.072
Old habit.

27:44.061 --> 27:45.795
You can come down now, Lin-Lin.

27:45.796 --> 27:47.462
You're fine.

27:47.497 --> 27:49.097
No sores or warts.

28:09.852 --> 28:11.585
What do you see?

28:12.721 --> 28:14.622
Nothing that's bad.

28:20.929 --> 28:23.397
- That's from me?
- Mm-hmm.

28:23.398 --> 28:25.666
You're lucky.

28:25.900 --> 28:28.402
We're gonna have to start the two
other girls on mercury treatment.

28:28.403 --> 28:31.138
Thank you.

28:31.340 --> 28:33.808
If you ever have any burning,
itching, or pain down there,

28:33.875 --> 28:35.275
you come to me immediately.

28:35.276 --> 28:36.676
No work.

28:36.711 --> 28:38.245
Maybe work a little.

28:38.246 --> 28:40.280
No, no sex.

28:40.414 --> 28:43.450
You don't have to have sex to make money.

28:43.718 --> 28:46.519
Well, you can't guarantee that
a customer won't want intercourse

28:46.554 --> 28:47.787
and that's a problem.

28:47.889 --> 28:50.189
I make him want other things.

28:50.291 --> 28:53.526
When he's in my hand, I control him.

28:53.694 --> 28:56.596
That's when I can get anything I want.

29:18.919 --> 29:21.120
Quite a weighty tome

29:21.221 --> 29:24.790
for a delicate dove like you.

29:24.824 --> 29:26.859
It's a medical textbook.

29:29.663 --> 29:33.832
You know, I noticed an
interesting phenomenon

29:33.933 --> 29:37.936
associated with medical textbooks.

29:38.004 --> 29:40.405
Whenever I chance to open one,

29:40.507 --> 29:43.475
I'm always convinced that I suffer

29:43.643 --> 29:46.712
from whatever disease
happens to catch my eye.

29:47.947 --> 29:49.781
I don't think you'll suffer this one.

29:52.652 --> 29:55.020
Oh, God.

29:57.256 --> 29:58.990
It's just a disease of the uterus.

30:00.759 --> 30:02.093
Surely you're not unacquainted

30:02.195 --> 30:03.694
with that part of a woman's body.

30:06.765 --> 30:09.700
Whatever do you mean, Nurse Elkins?

30:13.840 --> 30:16.574
You've been through the nursing
staff like Grant through Richmond.

30:20.346 --> 30:23.848
And you think that has acquainted me

30:23.983 --> 30:28.685
to an unusual degree with female anatomy?

30:32.324 --> 30:35.192
Stands to reason.

30:35.227 --> 30:37.494
My adrenaline research.

30:39.564 --> 30:41.998
I look forward to reading
this over the weekend.

30:44.336 --> 30:48.172
But if it's all I expect it to be,

30:48.340 --> 30:52.475
consider your position
here significantly improved

30:52.543 --> 30:55.045
and in short order indeed.

30:55.145 --> 30:57.581
I was hoping you'd say that.

31:00.184 --> 31:02.719
Here's a paper published by
the French Academy of Sciences

31:02.920 --> 31:05.822
on the treatment of cancer
using radioactive substances,

31:06.023 --> 31:08.692
and it found that malignant
tumors are more susceptible

31:08.860 --> 31:11.795
to the influences of
radiation than normal tissue.

31:12.029 --> 31:14.831
And I was wondering if it might
be possible to use that fact

31:15.065 --> 31:17.801
to isolate a tumor and improve
its chances of successful removal.

31:21.705 --> 31:23.872
An intriguing hypothesis.

31:26.243 --> 31:29.612
Let's talk about it after you've
finished your work with adrenaline.

31:37.687 --> 31:41.257
Well, we're all here. Gentlemen,
may I introduce Edward Croker,

31:41.425 --> 31:44.460
chief of the fire department
of the city of New York.

31:44.461 --> 31:46.329
Chief Croker.

31:46.463 --> 31:48.297
There will be an investigation, of course,

31:48.432 --> 31:50.833
after which they'll convene a grand jury.

31:51.067 --> 31:53.869
But I can tell you right now,
the upshot is the poor bastard

31:54.037 --> 31:56.872
responsible for the
dynamite storehouse on Park

31:57.073 --> 31:59.808
will be posthumously charged
with criminal negligence.

31:59.976 --> 32:01.856
And that, for all practical purposes,

32:02.045 --> 32:05.147
will discharge us from
any legal responsibility.

32:05.381 --> 32:08.550
However, I believe it will
still be necessary to buy out

32:08.752 --> 32:11.887
the residents of Park Avenue
whose homes were damaged.

32:12.088 --> 32:15.624
By my reckoning, $1
million should do the trick.

32:15.826 --> 32:18.826
Can I rely upon you gentlemen
for a third part of it each?

32:18.961 --> 32:21.729
Henry, will that be a problem?

32:21.764 --> 32:23.998
No. No, it won't.

32:27.235 --> 32:29.637
I paid a visit to Mr. Speight's residence

32:29.772 --> 32:31.505
and I think you'll be interested to learn

32:31.774 --> 32:35.543
that his family and all of his
belongings are nowhere to be seen.

32:35.644 --> 32:38.112
I found that in the fireplace.

32:38.347 --> 32:41.683
It's a second-class ticket on
the Ardlethen out of Rotterdam.

32:41.851 --> 32:44.118
I can't make out the
holder's Christian name,

32:44.186 --> 32:46.287
but his surname is Petrizzi.

32:46.488 --> 32:49.422
I looked it up and the ship
arrived here just last month,

32:49.624 --> 32:52.693
so there's a possibility Mr.
Petrizzi is still in town.

33:02.837 --> 33:05.939
I found that in the inside
pocket of Mr. Speight's jacket

33:06.040 --> 33:09.209
after the coroner sent over his clothes.

33:09.343 --> 33:11.544
The pages have been mostly washed clean,

33:11.646 --> 33:14.915
but there is one entry there.

33:17.284 --> 33:20.353
Pasteurella pestis.

33:20.454 --> 33:22.923
Well, that's bubonic plague.

33:27.494 --> 33:29.614
Is that the brain of Mr.
Carton, your morphine addict?

33:29.663 --> 33:31.931
No, no, no, no. This is a lab sample.

33:32.032 --> 33:34.834
Mr. Carton is still very much alive.

33:34.868 --> 33:37.770
So...

33:39.239 --> 33:42.775
this corresponds to the part of his brain

33:43.010 --> 33:46.645
that lit up like a Roman candle
when he was given the morphine.

33:46.747 --> 33:48.948
I'm working under the hypothesis

33:49.049 --> 33:51.784
that by detaching the affected area,

33:51.885 --> 33:55.187
his cravings may be eliminated.

33:55.488 --> 33:59.925
The risk is accidentally damaging
another part of the brain in the process.

34:01.595 --> 34:03.763
May I offer an alternative?

34:03.764 --> 34:04.829
Like what?

34:04.897 --> 34:06.865
Something far less drastic.

34:06.866 --> 34:07.866
Vasectomy.

34:15.007 --> 34:16.808
Everett, unless you know something I don't,

34:17.043 --> 34:20.344
I really don't see how severing
the tubes of his testicles

34:20.512 --> 34:23.380
will cure Mr. Carton of
his morphine addiction.

34:23.683 --> 34:27.351
No, but it'll certainly prove effective
of curing society of the likes of him.

34:27.453 --> 34:29.520
That sounds like the eugenicist line.

34:29.789 --> 34:33.158
If we can prevent those unfortunates
from producing their own offspring,

34:33.358 --> 34:35.860
the amount of congenital
defectives will be decreased.

34:36.128 --> 34:39.047
Subsequent generations of our race
will be that much better going forward.

34:40.632 --> 34:42.600
Your race?

34:47.639 --> 34:50.808
Well, I suppose this is progress.

34:50.976 --> 34:53.710
In the antebellum South,
they would cite the Bible

34:53.812 --> 34:57.214
as justification for Negro inferiority.

34:57.216 --> 34:58.449
Your point?

34:58.584 --> 35:01.619
Well, now instead, you justify your racism

35:01.720 --> 35:04.622
using some asinine pseudoscience.

35:04.756 --> 35:06.957
I can understand why you're emotional.

35:07.126 --> 35:09.960
Future knowledge always
sounds like pseudoscience

35:09.995 --> 35:11.495
until it's accepted.

35:11.597 --> 35:13.431
Oh, I have something you should accept.

35:13.732 --> 35:17.000
For God's sake, gentlemen. Even this
brain is getting bored of this horseshit.

35:19.104 --> 35:20.871
Please.

35:24.309 --> 35:28.011
I think the Corton Clos
Du Roi '93 with the meat,

35:28.147 --> 35:32.016
then the Meursault-Perrieres
'87 with the fish

35:32.017 --> 35:34.985
and...

35:35.153 --> 35:37.654
Veuve Clicquot Yellow
Label '93 with dessert.

35:43.261 --> 35:44.761
You'll like dessert.

35:44.929 --> 35:46.964
Sherry's makes its own
ice cream in the basement.

35:48.599 --> 35:50.367
Ah.

35:57.341 --> 36:00.309
Sweet nectar of the gods.

36:00.310 --> 36:02.044
What is it?

36:04.447 --> 36:06.482
Oh.

36:06.516 --> 36:08.150
The latest thing.

36:08.318 --> 36:10.452
Something I brought
back from San Francisco.

36:10.554 --> 36:14.390
Equal parts vermouth and Old Toms gin.

36:14.457 --> 36:16.525
It's called a Martinez.

36:16.694 --> 36:19.728
Well, it tastes like
cherry-flavored kerosene.

36:19.863 --> 36:22.164
You possess a very discerning palate, Lucy.

36:31.508 --> 36:35.844
Do you know the history of
this type of cocktail glass?

36:37.514 --> 36:39.882
Well, it's modeled after the glass

36:40.016 --> 36:42.518
from which the Greek gods drank ambrosia,

36:42.686 --> 36:45.854
which is said to have
been molded originally

36:45.988 --> 36:48.924
from the actual breast of Aphrodite,

36:48.925 --> 36:50.859
goddess of love.

36:52.195 --> 36:54.696
You see that little indentation

36:54.764 --> 36:57.265
between the bowl and the stem?

36:57.534 --> 37:01.402
The explanation for that is on
account of the old girl's nipple.

37:05.608 --> 37:08.576
Mr. Robertson...

37:08.577 --> 37:11.512
Henry,

37:11.580 --> 37:13.948
I don't see any such thing.

37:15.517 --> 37:18.853
While it is a very pretty glass, certainly,

37:19.020 --> 37:23.057
I believe you're suffering
from wishful thinking.

37:25.427 --> 37:27.161
Are you blushing?

37:29.131 --> 37:33.567
You weren't such a delicate
flower earlier today

37:33.769 --> 37:37.604
when we were discussing a
certain point of female anatomy.

37:40.242 --> 37:42.343
You're a practicing nurse.

37:42.443 --> 37:44.511
Are you by any chance acquainted

37:44.612 --> 37:48.015
with a phenomenon called whiplash?

37:48.216 --> 37:50.985
Because I believe I'm
suffering from it right now.

37:52.487 --> 37:56.190
Actually, I find the sensation

37:56.191 --> 37:58.225
rather enjoyable.

38:21.348 --> 38:23.749
There they are.

38:23.818 --> 38:25.385
Now, good night, Leonard,

38:25.452 --> 38:27.253
and good night, Ethel.

38:27.387 --> 38:31.457
Sleep tight and don't let the bedbugs bite.

38:31.458 --> 38:33.092
All right?

39:05.858 --> 39:07.758
Oh, my.

39:12.931 --> 39:15.066
Oh, my goodness.

39:17.269 --> 39:20.137
It's been ages since we've been together

39:20.239 --> 39:24.707
and I know that men have needs

39:24.742 --> 39:27.977
for hygienic purposes.

39:28.045 --> 39:30.446
Especially a man like you

39:30.447 --> 39:33.216
who works so hard.

39:34.952 --> 39:38.588
Yes, I do work hard, my dear.

39:45.062 --> 39:46.796
So what's wrong?

39:46.797 --> 39:48.464
Nothing.

39:48.465 --> 39:50.166
Nothing's wrong.

39:52.068 --> 39:54.604
I'm very lucky to be married
to you. Everyone says so.

39:59.276 --> 40:01.477
So what's the matter?

40:04.548 --> 40:05.948
I just...

40:14.591 --> 40:16.025
What are you doing?

40:16.159 --> 40:20.528
I'm afraid I have some
business to attend to.

40:22.231 --> 40:23.832
Now?

40:25.835 --> 40:28.369
I'll be late.

40:28.404 --> 40:30.171
No need to wait up.

40:34.644 --> 40:36.778
Herman?

40:39.749 --> 40:42.283
Oh, God.

40:44.854 --> 40:47.320
Oh, God.

40:54.663 --> 40:57.031
We're inferior.

40:58.967 --> 41:01.301
We're condescended to.

41:02.971 --> 41:05.739
We're taken for granted.

41:05.774 --> 41:08.375
We're made fun of.

41:09.678 --> 41:12.412
We're attacked. We're ignored.

41:12.514 --> 41:15.548
We're worthless. We're a pestilence.

41:15.549 --> 41:18.051
We're invisible.

41:21.154 --> 41:24.523
That's the story of the Negro in America.

41:26.026 --> 41:28.661
That's the tale they tell.

41:30.664 --> 41:32.699
That's what they say.

41:37.571 --> 41:40.206
Does what a man says matter?

41:43.010 --> 41:45.912
We were born in this country,

41:46.013 --> 41:48.747
the land of equality by birth.

41:48.748 --> 41:50.415
That's what it says.

41:50.517 --> 41:53.418
That's what the man says it says.

41:53.419 --> 41:55.087
So again,

41:55.187 --> 41:58.489
does what a man says matter?

41:58.491 --> 42:00.192
Yes.

42:00.226 --> 42:03.328
Do his words matter?

42:03.362 --> 42:06.064
Do his laws matter?

42:06.165 --> 42:07.933
- Yes.
- Yes.

42:07.934 --> 42:09.735
Yes!

42:09.903 --> 42:13.238
Because when a man's
words or laws don't matter,

42:13.339 --> 42:15.107
that's when you have chaos.

42:15.207 --> 42:17.042
That's when you have conflict.

42:17.109 --> 42:19.410
That's when you have corruption.

42:21.113 --> 42:25.149
When a man's words or laws don't matter,

42:25.183 --> 42:27.918
forget about justice

42:28.020 --> 42:29.720
because people don't even know

42:29.788 --> 42:32.189
where to look to for justice.

42:32.290 --> 42:36.894
So does it matter what a man says?

42:36.895 --> 42:38.729
Yes.

42:49.107 --> 42:52.743
The story of the Negro in America...

42:54.412 --> 42:58.749
is the story of America.

43:14.966 --> 43:16.667
Dr. Everett Gallinger,

43:16.767 --> 43:19.836
may I present Mr. Samuel Reid.

43:19.971 --> 43:22.138
- Pleasure to meet you.
- How do you do?

43:22.307 --> 43:25.341
We were just discussing
a most distressing problem

43:25.509 --> 43:28.177
concerning mental
defectives in our community.

43:28.345 --> 43:31.747
Your advice on the matter
would be invaluable, Everett.

43:31.848 --> 43:33.683
- Won't you have a seat?
- Thank you.

43:38.688 --> 43:41.791
Dr. Gallinger, I operate the Idiot House

43:41.825 --> 43:43.693
on Randall's Island.

43:43.960 --> 43:47.697
It's a state-financed home for boys
the courts have deemed to be morons.

43:47.797 --> 43:49.965
Sounds like a worthy institution.

43:50.100 --> 43:53.501
The problem is once the boys reach manhood,

43:53.603 --> 43:56.104
we are legally bound to release them,

43:56.205 --> 43:59.241
which, unfortunately, leaves them free

43:59.342 --> 44:02.611
to engender more idiots like themselves.

44:02.612 --> 44:04.679
I see.

44:04.881 --> 44:08.817
Well, gentlemen, I believe
I have a solution for you.

44:10.020 --> 44:11.686
So then he said to her,

44:11.788 --> 44:15.123
"Well, I'm not Mark Twain."

44:33.676 --> 44:35.542
All right, dear?

44:36.745 --> 44:38.612
Maybe a little port.

44:43.718 --> 44:46.452
Forgive my appearance, Miss Everidge,

44:46.520 --> 44:49.655
but I didn't want to miss you.

44:49.824 --> 44:53.393
Bertie's given me clippings
of all your stories.

44:53.394 --> 44:55.929
Oh.

44:55.997 --> 44:59.099
And did you have a favorite?

44:59.333 --> 45:02.735
I think it's the one where
you dined with the red Indians.

45:04.705 --> 45:07.039
I'm just glad you came
back with your scalp intact.

45:07.040 --> 45:09.241
Oh, Bertie.

45:09.342 --> 45:11.510
Didn't you read the clipping?

45:11.611 --> 45:14.113
They were very civilized hosts.

45:14.214 --> 45:16.282
They would never scalp a guest,

45:16.382 --> 45:18.317
especially such a lovely one.

45:20.020 --> 45:22.221
Bertie was telling us that
Genevieve also translated

45:22.288 --> 45:24.423
a paper for him from the Polish.

45:24.524 --> 45:28.293
Yes, Dr. Zinberg was duly impressed.

45:28.393 --> 45:32.230
A linguist as well as an adventuress.

45:32.297 --> 45:34.565
How did you come to learn Polish?

45:34.633 --> 45:37.068
It's my parents' native tongue.

45:37.103 --> 45:38.236
I spoke it growing up.

45:38.303 --> 45:39.971
Your parents are Polish?

45:39.972 --> 45:41.973
Mm, Galician Jews.

45:41.974 --> 45:44.976
Oh.

45:45.111 --> 45:48.379
I hope that doesn't present a problem.

45:48.480 --> 45:51.248
After all, your savior was also a Jew.

45:51.315 --> 45:53.216
There's some debate about that.

45:53.284 --> 45:56.086
No, he was a Jew, all right.

45:56.154 --> 45:58.355
You know how you can tell?

45:58.456 --> 46:00.123
His mother thought he was a god

46:00.225 --> 46:02.592
and he thought she was a virgin.

46:35.492 --> 46:38.227
I hope I wasn't being too presumptuous,

46:38.361 --> 46:40.696
but I saw you hiding your hands earlier.

46:41.799 --> 46:44.400
It's very kind of you.

46:44.534 --> 46:48.471
I'm afraid I haven't
had the strength lately

46:48.538 --> 46:51.240
to take proper care of myself.

46:51.441 --> 46:54.876
Well, I could come back
next week and varnish them,

46:54.877 --> 46:56.244
if you'd like.

46:56.279 --> 46:58.547
You mean paint them?

46:58.548 --> 47:00.649
Good heavens.

47:00.817 --> 47:04.419
I've never in all my life
painted my fingernails.

47:04.521 --> 47:06.755
My mother would turn over in her grave.

47:09.392 --> 47:12.260
You know, I don't think I've ever seen

47:12.329 --> 47:14.229
quite such a large handbag.

47:16.499 --> 47:18.634
Well, tool of the trade.

47:18.735 --> 47:21.069
"Allzeit bereit," as the Germans say.

47:21.070 --> 47:23.271
"Always prepared."

47:23.306 --> 47:24.873
Would you like to see?

47:26.175 --> 47:27.909
If you don't mind.

47:31.247 --> 47:34.715
Well, my reporter's notepad
and pencil, of course.

47:36.352 --> 47:38.686
Press credentials.

47:40.256 --> 47:43.024
Uh, my billfold.

47:46.528 --> 47:48.763
A lucky kachina doll

47:48.831 --> 47:51.332
given to me by the Hopi.

47:51.433 --> 47:54.436
This is a photograph of my parents.

47:58.606 --> 48:00.740
And a photograph of Bertie.

48:10.585 --> 48:13.120
I don't know how my
family's going to get on...

48:17.725 --> 48:19.159
when...

48:22.097 --> 48:24.565
With help.

48:58.432 --> 49:02.267
Well, thank you for the
best meal I've ever eaten.

49:02.335 --> 49:05.137
Well, the first of many, I hope.

49:11.277 --> 49:13.779
Whiplash.

49:14.013 --> 49:16.815
An injury caused by a sudden
strain to the muscles of the neck.

49:40.773 --> 49:43.475
Who died, Mr. Barrow?

49:43.542 --> 49:45.210
What do you mean?

49:47.146 --> 49:50.515
My father told me riches and
honors depend upon heaven.

49:50.516 --> 49:54.219
Ah, well...

49:54.287 --> 49:57.289
I hardly knew my father.

49:57.357 --> 49:59.624
Consider yourself fortunate.

49:59.792 --> 50:02.626
Mine was a violent man
and a son of a bitch.

50:02.794 --> 50:04.928
Did he come here to work on the railroad?

50:07.132 --> 50:09.200
The California gold rush.

50:13.505 --> 50:15.172
He insisted I be educated

50:15.340 --> 50:18.775
in accordance to strict
Confucian principles

50:18.977 --> 50:21.679
in expectation of the day
he would strike it rich

50:21.746 --> 50:23.947
and we would return to China.

50:28.987 --> 50:30.667
He wouldn't even permit me to learn English

50:30.688 --> 50:32.888
when I was still young enough to master it.

50:38.095 --> 50:39.562
But he never struck the mother lode

50:39.663 --> 50:41.764
and I fell in with gangsters.

50:43.867 --> 50:46.802
I suppose I was a great
disappointment to him.

50:54.078 --> 50:57.713
Your debt to me is now
repaid in full, Mr. Barrow,

50:57.915 --> 51:00.616
and this part of our
business has come to an end.

51:02.586 --> 51:05.520
Not quite.

51:05.589 --> 51:07.422
I'd like to discuss a remedy

51:07.524 --> 51:11.060
to Junia's indentured state.

51:11.061 --> 51:13.629
A remedy?

51:13.797 --> 51:17.833
Do I understand you to mean
I am some kind of disease?

51:19.135 --> 51:22.738
Forgive me. I spoke thoughtlessly.

51:22.873 --> 51:25.942
You spoke like a man who runs a hospital.

51:25.943 --> 51:27.643
3,000.

51:30.747 --> 51:32.147
1,500.

51:32.148 --> 51:34.149
2,000.

51:34.150 --> 51:35.284
Done.

51:35.285 --> 51:37.852
Very good.

51:44.994 --> 51:48.664
Oh, I'll have the money for you shortly.

51:52.168 --> 51:53.935
Then rest assured

51:54.137 --> 51:57.205
I will keep her safe and
gainfully employed until you do.

52:53.227 --> 52:55.995
Gentlemen,

52:56.030 --> 52:58.431
the source of addiction.

53:12.312 --> 53:14.546
The place is perfect for
a man such as yourself.

53:14.581 --> 53:16.682
A family man of means.

53:16.916 --> 53:19.785
That's how you would describe
yourself, isn't it, Mr. Barrow?

53:19.819 --> 53:21.487
Beg your pardon?

53:21.588 --> 53:23.321
I believe you said you have two children.

53:23.323 --> 53:24.856
That's right.

53:24.990 --> 53:27.191
The nursery is on the ground floor

53:27.226 --> 53:29.427
and this is the parlor,

53:29.595 --> 53:33.264
a gracious stage for your
wife to entertain upon.

53:33.499 --> 53:37.402
My wife will never see the
inside of this room, I assure you.

53:37.403 --> 53:39.537
I'm sorry?

53:39.572 --> 53:41.572
Nor even my kiddies.

53:41.574 --> 53:43.641
How much?

53:43.742 --> 53:46.277
7,000 for two floors facing the street.

53:46.411 --> 53:49.313
The ones facing the park are somewhat more.

53:49.347 --> 53:51.348
A steal, I assure you.

53:51.516 --> 53:55.652
Once the subway opens,
your investment will soar.

54:00.025 --> 54:01.926
Mr. Carton?

54:04.629 --> 54:06.964
Mr. Carton, can you hear me?

54:30.955 --> 54:32.855
Let's get started.

54:37.128 --> 54:39.195
Will you come with me, Moishe?

54:48.005 --> 54:50.673
Do what the nice man tells you to do.

54:53.577 --> 54:55.711
Your name is Moishe? You're a Yid?

54:55.746 --> 54:57.780
Uh, yes, sir.

54:57.782 --> 54:59.215
Very good.

54:59.349 --> 55:02.118
Remove your trousers
and hop up on the table.
