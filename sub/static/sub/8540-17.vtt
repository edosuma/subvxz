I WAS AT
A CLIENT'S RESIDENCE NEARBY,

03:08.927 --> 03:12.453

AN ELECTRICAL CHARGE

03:41.482 --> 03:44.180

HE'S NOT COMING BACK.THERE'S SECURITY CAMERAS
OUT THERE.

04:09.161 --> 04:11.076
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

04:11.076 --> 04:14.471

04:32.097 --> 04:35.100
WELL, THE CASE IS
PRACTICALLY CLOSED.

04:35.100 --> 04:39.104
THERE'S NO REASON TO BE
SNARKY.

04:39.104 --> 04:41.106
IT WAS MY WIFE JOLENE,
REALLY.

04:41.106 --> 04:44.109
SHE SAW HOW MUCH JAMES HELPED
LANIE WITH HER SCHOOLWORK,

04:44.109 --> 04:47.112
AND WHEN SHE HEARD
HE NEEDED A PLACE TO LIVE,

04:47.112 --> 04:49.114
SHE RENTED THE POOL HOUSE
TO HIM.

04:49.114 --> 04:51.073
I GUESS HE'S BEEN HERE,
UH...

04:51.073 --> 04:53.684
I DON'T KNOW.
A COUPLE OF MONTHS, MAYBE.

04:53.684 --> 04:55.686
VERY GENEROUS

05:06.044 --> 05:08.003
BEFORE I MET HER,
I WAS TAKING SNAPSHOTS.

05:08.003 --> 05:11.659
MR. BANKS, WE'RE GONNA NEED
TO TALK TO YOUR DAUGHTER.

05:11.659 --> 05:14.879

WE NEED TO SPEAK TO HER
WHEN HER MEMORY'S FRESH.SHE SAW WHAT YOU SAW.

05:20.145 --> 05:22.626

WENT TO THE POOL HOUSE

05:22.626 --> 05:25.455
FOR SOME HOMEWORK HELP...WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO HEAR THAT FROM HER.

05:25.455 --> 05:27.762
AND SHE FOUND A DEAD BODY.

05:27.762 --> 05:30.330

06:01.535 --> 06:04.451
ON THE BACK
OF A SACRED HIPPOPOTAMUS?

06:04.451 --> 06:06.540
THAT'S TRUE.

06:06.540 --> 06:09.325

06:46.406 --> 06:49.583
LANIE, WHY DIDN'T YOUR MOTHER
WANT YOU TO SPEAK TO US?

06:49.583 --> 06:51.628
SHE'S NOT MY MOTHER.

06:51.628 --> 06:53.369
HONEY, IT--IT'S OKAY.

06:53.369 --> 06:55.023
I WAS PROTECTING HER.

06:55.023 --> 06:58.069
SHE'S BEEN THROUGH
A VERY TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE.

06:58.069 --> 07:01.246
OH, I THOUGHT YOU WERE WORRIED
SHE WAS GONNA SAY SOMETHING

07:01.246 --> 07:04.206

07:45.073 --> 07:48.946

[Van Pelt] THE VICTIM,
JAMES SMITHSON, DOESN'T EXIST.

08:14.972 --> 08:16.974
PASSPORT'S FAKE.
HIS REFERENCES ARE BOGUS.

08:16.974 --> 08:19.629
I RAN HIS PRINTS
THROUGH ALL THE DATABASES.

08:19.629 --> 08:21.588
THERE'S NOTHING,
NOTHING AT ALL.

08:21.588 --> 08:24.547
YOUR FRIEND BANDINO DIDN'T DO
MUCH OF A BACKGROUND CHECK.

08:24.547 --> 08:26.506
MM. THAT'S NOT LIKE HIM.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.986
HE'S NOT THE SHARPEST KNIFE
IN THE DRAWER,

08:28.986 --> 08:31.946
BUT HE ALWAYS DID
THE LEGWORK.DO YOU THINK MAYBE HE'S
HOLDING SOMETHING BACK,

08:31.946 --> 08:34.601
PROTECTING HIS CLIENTS?YEAH, I'LL CHECK IT OUT.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.385

08:41.085 --> 08:43.566
IT'S GONNA BE FINE
WITH THE NEW BOSS.

08:43.566 --> 08:46.003
I MEAN, SURE, THERE'LL BE
A SETTLING-IN PERIOD

08:46.003 --> 08:49.137
WHEN SHE PROBES YOUR PSYCHE
FOR WEAKNESS,

08:49.137 --> 08:52.227
BUT ONCE THAT'S
OUT OF THE WAY--WOULD YOU STOP?
YOU'RE BEING SO CHILDISH.

08:52.227 --> 08:55.186
I THINK YOU'RE
THE ONE WHO'S NERVOUS.

08:55.186 --> 08:57.145
OOH. THAT SOUNDS PERCEPTIVE.
LET ME THINK ABOUT THAT.

08:57.145 --> 09:00.888
NO. I FIND THAT I'M NOT.
IT'S DEFINITELY YOU.

09:00.888 --> 09:03.325

09:10.985 --> 09:13.030
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHO DID IT?

09:13.030 --> 09:15.903
WE'RE STILL INVESTIGATING,
MRS. BLANKMAN.

09:15.903 --> 09:18.079
NOW THE PARENTS AND STUDENTS
WE'VE TALKED TO ALL SAY

09:18.079 --> 09:20.734
HE WAS A GREAT TUTOR,
BUT NOT MUCH ELSE.

09:20.734 --> 09:23.084
HOW WELL DID YOU KNOW
MR. SMITHSON?

09:23.084 --> 09:24.738
NOT THAT WELL.

09:24.738 --> 09:27.436

09:44.148 --> 09:47.064
OH. I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T OFFER YOU--OH, N-N-NO, PLEASE.

MONEY PROBLEMS?
ANYTHING UNUSUAL?

10:37.985 --> 10:39.943
THEY JUST STUDIED.

10:39.943 --> 10:42.511
SMELLED SO GOOD,
I WENT AND MADE YOU ONE.

10:42.511 --> 10:45.035
LEMONGRASS, MY FAVORITE.

10:45.035 --> 10:46.689
[sighs]

10:46.689 --> 10:48.691
YEAH, IT'S FUNNY
HOW SMELLS WORK.

10:48.691 --> 10:52.129
THEY ATTACH THEMSELVES
TO SUCH SPECIFIC MEMORIES.

10:52.129 --> 10:55.089
YOU KNOW, LIKE THE, UH,
KITCHEN OF A CHILDHOOD HOME,

10:55.089 --> 10:57.221
OR HAVING A CUP OF TEA
WITH A LOVER.

10:57.221 --> 10:58.396
[inhales and exhales deeply]

10:58.396 --> 11:01.573
[whispers] YES.

11:01.573 --> 11:04.011
YES.

11:04.011 --> 11:06.013
YES,
YOU AND JAMES WERE LOVERS.

11:06.013 --> 11:09.494
[voice breaking] YES.

11:09.494 --> 11:11.148
MM-HMM.

11:11.148 --> 11:14.151
OH, YOU MIGHT NOT WANT
TO DRINK THAT.

11:14.151 --> 11:16.937
THAT'S
A LITTLE... FUNKY MONKEY.[gasps]

11:16.937 --> 11:19.156
WHAT KIND OF BACKGROUND CHECK
DID YOU DO, VIC?

11:19.156 --> 11:22.203
[Vic] THE USUAL.

11:22.203 --> 11:25.162
I CALLED HIS LAST EMPLOYER.
I CHECKED HIS CREDIT.WELL, JAMES SMITHSON ISN'T
JAMES SMITHSON.

11:25.162 --> 11:28.165
NONE OF IT'S TRUE.WELL, THERE'S A LIMIT
TO WHAT I CAN DO, YOU KNOW?

11:28.165 --> 11:31.125
I'M NOT THE CIA, HERE.AW, COME ON, MAN. YOU USED
TO BE MORE GUNG-HO THAN THAT.

11:31.125 --> 11:33.518
[laughs] THAT'S
WHY I'M NOT A COP ANYMORE.

11:33.518 --> 11:35.477
IT'S TOO STRESSFUL.
UNHEALTHY PROFESSION.

11:35.477 --> 11:37.131
YEAH, NO KIDDING.

11:37.131 --> 11:39.786
HEY, YOU GOT ANYTHING?

11:39.786 --> 11:41.788
SERIOUSLY, YOU HEAR
ABOUT HANK HARRISON?

11:41.788 --> 11:44.312
39 YEARS OLD,
5 YEARS OUT FROM HIS PENSION--

11:44.312 --> 11:47.184
BOOM. HEART ATTACK.
A WIFE, TWO KIDS.

11:47.184 --> 11:49.273
HE HAD THAT, UH,
THAT BACHELOR PARTY, REMEMBER?

11:49.273 --> 11:50.797
UH, NO.

11:50.797 --> 11:52.842
AW, COME ON.
SURE YOU DO.

11:52.842 --> 11:55.889
THE STRIPPER WAS ALL OVER
HIS CASE, I'M TELLING YA.

11:55.889 --> 11:57.978
I BET SHE WAS.

11:57.978 --> 12:01.503
OH. [laughs] OH, HEY.
ARE YOU TWO, LIKE, UH--

12:01.503 --> 12:03.505
ARE YOU DATING EACH OTHER?

12:03.505 --> 12:05.420
NO, WE'RE NOT.NO.

12:05.420 --> 12:08.162
NO? BECAUSE YOU BOTH LOOKED
A LITTLE WEIRD JUST NOW.NO.

12:08.162 --> 12:10.294
WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT A MURDER HERE.

12:10.294 --> 12:13.297
YEAH. YEAH, HEY, LOOK,
I'M SORRY, ALL RIGHT?

12:13.297 --> 12:15.343
UH, THERE IS ONE THING.

12:15.343 --> 12:18.912
A COUPLE MONTHS AGO, HOPPER WAS
WORKING ON THIS PHOTO THING.

12:18.912 --> 12:21.653
HE, UH--HE ASKED ME
TO GET HIM A GUN.

12:21.653 --> 12:24.004
OLD-FASHIONED PIECE,
LIKE THE FBI WAS USING

12:24.004 --> 12:26.441
IN SOME '60s MOVIE HE SAW.LIKE A .38?

12:26.441 --> 12:28.660
YEAH, I GUESS.

12:28.660 --> 12:30.706
WE NEVER GOT TO THAT.
I TURNED HIM DOWN.

12:30.706 --> 12:33.491
TOLD HIM IF HE WANTED IT
LIKE THE MOVIE, GET A PROP GUN.

12:33.491 --> 12:36.233
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE DID IN THE END,

12:36.233 --> 12:39.497
BUT IT'S WORTH MENTIONING,
RIGHT?YEAH. YEAH, IT IS.
THANKS, MAN. APPRECIATE IT.

12:39.497 --> 12:41.412
HEY, ABSOLUTELY.THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.

12:41.412 --> 12:43.545
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.
HEY, LISTEN.

12:43.545 --> 12:46.504
WHAT SAY YOU AND ME GO GET A CUP
OF COFFEE SOME TIME? [chuckles]NO, THANKS.

12:46.504 --> 12:49.116
HUH? WHAT'S COFFEE?
I'M A NICE GUY, RIGHT, RIGS?

12:49.116 --> 12:51.074
SEE YA LATER, VIC.

12:51.074 --> 12:54.512
[Cho] SO SMITHSON WAS
A BIG LADIES' MAN,

12:54.512 --> 12:56.601
AND THEY'VE BOTH GOT
SOLID ALIBIS.

12:56.601 --> 12:59.387
MAGGIE BLANKMAN'S HUSBAND'S BEEN
IN RENO FOR THE LAST THREE DAYS,

12:59.387 --> 13:02.042
AND MAGGIE WAS
AT A THERAPIST'S SESSION

13:02.042 --> 13:04.958
FROM 2:00 TO 4:00 P.M.--
DOUBLE SESSION.JANE AND I ARE GONNA GO
TO HOPPER'S GALLERY,

13:04.958 --> 13:06.568
ASK ABOUT THE GUN.

13:06.568 --> 13:09.571
[exhales deeply]

13:09.571 --> 13:11.138
HEY. [sighs]

SO WHAT WAS HER NAME?

13:19.929 --> 13:21.061
WHO?

13:21.061 --> 13:22.889
THE STRIPPER.

13:22.889 --> 13:25.282
O-OH. I, UH...

13:25.282 --> 13:26.893
WE COULD DOUBLE-DATE--

13:26.893 --> 13:28.285
ME AND BANDINO,

13:28.285 --> 13:30.026
YOU AND YOUR STRIPPER.

13:30.026 --> 13:32.942
WH--I TH--
I THOUGHT Y-YOU...

13:32.942 --> 13:35.075
[laughs]

13:35.075 --> 13:36.424
OH. [laughs]

13:36.424 --> 13:38.165
THAT'S MEAN.

13:38.165 --> 13:40.123
KIDDING.

13:40.123 --> 13:42.125
OH, HER NAME WAS,

13:42.125 --> 13:44.171
OH, YEAH.
SWEET KANDY, WITH A "K."

13:44.171 --> 13:46.216
[singsongy] OH.

13:46.216 --> 13:49.263
[normal voice]
KANDY WITH A "K." MM-HMM.[typing]

13:51.395 --> 13:53.397
DO I OWN A GUN?

13:53.397 --> 13:55.443
YES, MR. BANKS, A .38.[sighs]

13:55.443 --> 13:58.446
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN IN
POSSESSION OF ONE OR OWNED ONE?

13:58.446 --> 14:01.057
I NEVER HAD A GUN,
ANY KIND.

14:01.057 --> 14:03.016
I DON'T BELIEVE IN THEM.

14:03.016 --> 14:05.061
YOU'RE JUST NOT TRYING
HARD ENOUGH.

14:05.061 --> 14:07.455
I AM. YOU JUST
CAN'T READ MINDS.

14:07.455 --> 14:09.936
YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES, OKAY?
I'M THE BOSS HERE.

14:09.936 --> 14:12.677
CONCENTRATE.

14:12.677 --> 14:15.855
IT'S COMING TO ME.
CHOCOLATE...

14:15.855 --> 14:18.509
COCONUT...

14:18.509 --> 14:20.990
SWIRL. HUH?

14:20.990 --> 14:22.600
VANILLA.

14:22.600 --> 14:23.993
PAY UP.

14:23.993 --> 14:25.995
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

14:25.995 --> 14:29.999
[laughs] YEAH, IT IS. HEY,
DAD, JUST GETTING ICE CREAM.

14:29.999 --> 14:31.914
OKAY.

14:31.914 --> 14:34.395
UH, WOULD YOU MIND
TAKING A POLYGRAPH TEST?

14:34.395 --> 14:36.005
NO. WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

14:36.005 --> 14:38.355
I'LL GIVE YOU THIS,
HOPPER--

14:38.355 --> 14:40.357
YOU HAVE
A VERY CONSISTENT VISION.

14:40.357 --> 14:43.360
A LITTLE CRAZY,
BUT CONSISTENT.

14:43.360 --> 14:46.581
[Hopper] I WOULDN'T EXPECT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M DOING.

14:46.581 --> 14:49.018
LET ME GIVE IT A SHOT.

14:49.018 --> 14:51.629
YOU ENJOY TAKING POSSESSION
OF YOUR WIFE,

14:51.629 --> 14:54.023
BUT ONLY ON CAMERA,
NOT IN THE FLESH.

14:54.023 --> 14:56.808
YOU WERE BEING CUCKOLDED
BY JAMES SMITHSON,

14:56.808 --> 14:58.854
AND YOU LET IT HAPPEN.

14:58.854 --> 15:01.291
WHY?
IMPOTENCE? MASOCHISM?

15:01.291 --> 15:03.250
HOMOSEXUALITY?

15:03.250 --> 15:05.600
I'M NOT SURE.

15:05.600 --> 15:08.995
[laughs] THAT'S VERY PERCEPTIVE,
MR. JANE. YOU HAVE A TALENT.

15:08.995 --> 15:11.258
MEH, IT'S JUST...
I DO. THANKS.

15:11.258 --> 15:13.260
IT'S JUST...
IT'S AN EASY CALL.

15:13.260 --> 15:16.045
YOU'RE VERY ATTRACTIVE
BUT UNHAPPY

15:16.045 --> 15:19.788
AND ACCUSTOMED TO USING
YOUR SEXUALITY AS A WEAPON.

15:19.788 --> 15:23.270
DID YOU USE YOUR SEXUALITY
AS A WEAPON AGAINST HIM?

15:23.270 --> 15:26.838
OKAY, YOU'RE DONE.
NOW... GO.

15:26.838 --> 15:29.450
WHAT DOES IT TAKE
TO GET YOU MAD, HOPPER?

15:29.450 --> 15:32.322
DID SMITHSON RUB YOUR NOSE
IN IT?THAT'S RIDICULOUS!

15:32.322 --> 15:34.585
WHAT'S WRONG?

15:34.585 --> 15:38.285
UH, NOTHING, HONEY. UH,
THESE PEOPLE WERE JUST LEAVING.YEAH, WE SHOULD LEAVE.

15:38.285 --> 15:40.113
LET'S. YEAH.

15:40.113 --> 15:42.071
OKAY.
HOW'S THE ICE CREAM?GOOD.

15:42.071 --> 15:44.030
YEAH.
HARD TO BEAT VANILLA.

15:48.860 --> 15:50.688
[Lisbon] I KNOW, I KNOW.

15:50.688 --> 15:53.691
YOU WERE MAKING STUFF UP
TO GET THE GUY ANGRY

15:53.691 --> 15:57.347
SO YOU COULD GET A READ
ON HIM. BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

15:57.347 --> 15:59.567
THE TRUTH IS,
YOU JUST DIDN'T LIKE THE GUY.

15:59.567 --> 16:03.136
WELL, THAT WOULD BE
VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.

16:03.136 --> 16:06.356
UM, COULD YOU TAKE
THE NEXT LEFT, PLEASE?

16:06.356 --> 16:09.142
OKAY.
WELL, WHAT DID YOU READ?

16:09.142 --> 16:11.144
DID HE DO IT?

16:11.144 --> 16:13.146
TAKE THE NEXT LEFT,
AND I'LL TELL YOU.

16:16.888 --> 16:19.108
WELL?

16:19.108 --> 16:21.502
WELL, MAYBE.
HE HAD A GOOD MOTIVE.

16:21.502 --> 16:24.026
AND MAYBE NOT.
THE RED BOX DIDN'T FIT.

16:24.026 --> 16:26.289
YOU PICKED UP A TAIL?

16:28.509 --> 16:30.076
CUL-DE-SAC.

16:38.171 --> 16:41.043
[turns off engine]

16:45.178 --> 16:47.180
[sighs]

16:47.180 --> 16:49.312
NOTHING.

16:49.312 --> 16:53.142

16:53.142 --> 16:54.796
UH-HUH.

17:05.111 --> 17:07.113
EXCUSE ME.

17:07.113 --> 17:09.724
WHY ARE YOU FOLLOWING US?

17:09.724 --> 17:11.726
[Southern accent]

17:11.726 --> 17:15.164

CALIFORNIA WAS FRIENDLY.

17:15.164 --> 17:18.037

17:22.867 --> 17:24.826
YOU GOT KIDS YET?

17:24.826 --> 17:27.176
THAT'S A TERRIBLE ACCENT.
DISGUISED BRITISH, YES?

17:27.176 --> 17:29.831

17:29.831 --> 17:33.008

17:43.497 --> 17:45.760
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

17:45.760 --> 17:47.196
TURN AROUND.

17:47.196 --> 17:50.417
A STRANGER ASKS TO SEE
YOUR I.D.,

17:50.417 --> 17:52.897
YOU ASK THEM
TO SHOW YOU THEIRS FIRST.

17:52.897 --> 17:57.163
UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU'RE
TRYING TO HIDE SOMETHING.

17:57.163 --> 17:59.904
[British accent] QUITE RIGHT.
QUITE RIGHT, MR. JANE.

17:59.904 --> 18:01.384

18:31.762 --> 18:34.374
I'M BEING NICE TO HIM,

18:34.374 --> 18:37.507

18:37.507 --> 18:40.119
THAT GOT KILLED?
FOR THE MURDER WEAPON?YOU'RE NOT EVEN

18:40.119 --> 18:42.121
AFTER YOUR PERFORMANCE
AT THE GALLERY,

18:42.121 --> 18:44.688
BANKS MADE
SOME PHONE CALLS.

18:44.688 --> 18:47.082
NOW JUDGE WITHERS WON'T SIGN
THE WARRANT.OOPS. SORRY.
UH, SHE'S A LITTLE CRANKY.

18:47.082 --> 18:50.129
NEW BOSS COMING IN.ENOUGH WITH THAT.
DID HIS STORY CHECK OUT?

18:50.129 --> 18:53.349
NOPE.ABOUT JAMES SMITHSON--
HIS REAL NAME'S OLIVER STANS.

18:53.349 --> 18:55.699
NINE MONTHS AGO HE STOLE
AN EXTREMELY VALUABLE ARTIFACT

18:55.699 --> 18:57.397
FROM THE BRITISH MUSEUM--

18:57.397 --> 19:00.704
A PRISTINE EXAMPLE OF
GRECO-ROMAN ART CIRCA 50 B.C.

19:00.704 --> 19:03.664
A WEDDING RING,
SAID TO BELONG TO CLEOPATRA,

19:03.664 --> 19:06.362
GIVEN HER BY MARK ANTONY.

19:06.362 --> 19:08.364
THAT'S WHAT WAS IN THE BOX.

19:08.364 --> 19:09.931
AH.

19:09.931 --> 19:11.672
HERE'S A COPY

19:11.672 --> 19:14.892
FROM THE MUSEUM GIFT SHOP.

19:14.892 --> 19:17.286
STANS LIFTED THE RING

19:17.286 --> 19:19.680
AND REPLACED IT
WITH ONE OF THOSE.

19:19.680 --> 19:22.900
WHAT WAS HE DOING
IN THE UNITED STATES?

19:22.900 --> 19:25.164
HE KNEW WE WERE BUILDING
A CASE AGAINST HIM.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.253
CHANGED HIS NAME,
DISAPPEARED.

19:27.253 --> 19:29.864
A WEEK AGO
WE PICKED UP CHATTER

19:29.864 --> 19:31.779
THAT A DEALER
IN STOLEN ANTIQUITIES

19:31.779 --> 19:34.999
WAS GONNA BUY THE RING HERE,
HAD SENT SOMEONE TO PICK IT UP.

19:34.999 --> 19:37.176
MAY I?

19:41.005 --> 19:42.790
THIS IS LOUIS ANGLET...

19:42.790 --> 19:46.272
[clicks]GO-TO COURIER IN
THE HIGH-END STOLEN ART MARKET.

19:46.272 --> 19:48.230
I FOLLOWED HIM HERE
TO STANS AND THE RING,

19:48.230 --> 19:49.927
BUT I ARRIVED TOO LATE.

19:49.927 --> 19:51.668
THAT'S WHY
I WAS FOLLOWING YOU.

19:51.668 --> 19:53.931
[sighs]
ANGLET HAS THE RING NOW,

19:53.931 --> 19:56.151
AND I NEED TO GET BACK
ON THE TRAIL.

19:56.151 --> 19:58.762
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE
UNTIL YOUR STORY CHECKS OUT.

19:58.762 --> 20:01.287
WHOEVER KILLED STANS
KILLED HIM FOR THE RING.

20:01.287 --> 20:04.115
RON, TAKE MR. SLOCOMBE
TO AN INTERROGATION ROOM.

20:04.115 --> 20:07.510
SIT ON HIM
WHILE I MAKE A CALL.

20:07.510 --> 20:08.859
SURE.

20:08.859 --> 20:10.470
[handcuffs click]

20:10.470 --> 20:12.341
LET'S GO.

20:14.822 --> 20:18.652
SLOCOMBE'S RIGHT.
JAMES SMITHSON IS OLIVER STANS.

20:18.652 --> 20:21.829
A FEW MINOR ARRESTS--
NARCOTICS POSSESSION CHARGE,

20:21.829 --> 20:23.309
ASSAULT.
LOOKS LIKE A BAR FIGHT.

20:23.309 --> 20:26.094
[typing]

20:26.094 --> 20:29.706
AND YES, A PERSON OF INTEREST
IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM THEFT.ANY NEXT OF KIN?
THE HOSPITAL CALLED.

20:29.706 --> 20:32.187
THEY NEED SOMEONE TO SIGN OFF
ON ORGAN DONATION.

20:32.187 --> 20:34.755
UH... STANS' MOTHER WAS
A SINGLE PARENT.

20:34.755 --> 20:37.105
DIED THREE YEARS AGO.
NO SIBLINGS.

20:37.105 --> 20:38.585
[Lisbon]
CHO, COME WITH ME.

20:38.585 --> 20:41.065
WE NEED TO ASK SLOCOMBE
SOME QUESTIONS.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.070
[gasps] HIS GUN'S GONE.

20:46.070 --> 20:48.377
I'LL GET
A SEARCH STARTED.

20:48.377 --> 20:50.423
RON, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

20:50.423 --> 20:51.641
[groans]

20:51.641 --> 20:53.730
FBI SAYS HE'S SCOTLAND YARD,

20:53.730 --> 20:56.124
BUT HE'S GOT NOTHING TO DO
WITH THIS CASE.

20:56.124 --> 20:58.735
NINE MONTHS AGO
WHEN THE RING WAS LIFTED,

20:58.735 --> 21:00.737
HE WENT OFF THE RESERVATION.

21:00.737 --> 21:03.218
HE'S BEEN TRACKING STANS
EVER SINCE.HMM.

21:03.218 --> 21:05.916
YOU THINK
HE HELPED WITH THE ROBBERY,

21:05.916 --> 21:09.224
AND STANS
DOUBLE-CROSSED HIM?NO. NO, SLOCOMBE'S JUST TRYING
TO GET THE RING BACK.

21:09.224 --> 21:12.488
"WHY?" IS THE BIG QUESTION.

21:12.488 --> 21:15.361
[Lisbon] YOU TWO,
GO TO HIS MOTEL ROOM.

21:15.361 --> 21:18.973
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND ANYTHING
THERE THAT'LL HELP US.OKAY.

21:18.973 --> 21:22.846
HEY, NO SIGN OF SLOCOMBE.
I GOT A GRID SEARCH STARTED.

21:22.846 --> 21:24.892
THIS IS PERFECT.
IT'S PERFECT.

21:24.892 --> 21:27.677
[telephone ringing in distance]

21:27.677 --> 21:29.940
AGENT LISBON.

21:31.986 --> 21:33.640
MADELEINE HIGHTOWER.

21:33.640 --> 21:36.382
SPECIAL AGENT HIGHTOWER,
WELCOME.THANK YOU.

21:36.382 --> 21:37.774
THIS IS PATRICK JANE.

21:37.774 --> 21:40.603
THE FAMOUS MR. JANE.

21:40.603 --> 21:42.823
MM-HMM.

21:42.823 --> 21:44.955
GOOD TO MEET YOU.YOU, TOO.

21:44.955 --> 21:47.567
I THOUGHT I'D HAVE
A NICE, QUIET DAY TODAY,

21:47.567 --> 21:49.656
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE
THERE'S TROUBLE.

21:49.656 --> 21:52.746
WE LOST SOMEBODY.

21:52.746 --> 21:54.878
WE'RE LOOKING FOR HIM.

21:54.878 --> 21:57.446
THEN I'M SURE
YOU'LL FIND HIM.

21:59.230 --> 22:01.842
LET'S TALK IN MY OFFICE.

22:01.842 --> 22:04.192
GIVE ME A HALF-HOUR
TO ROLL SOME CALLS.

22:04.192 --> 22:07.021
YES, MA'AM.

22:10.677 --> 22:14.333
SHE LIKES YOU.
I CAN TELL.

22:19.816 --> 22:23.429
[Rigsby] I'VE STAYED
IN WORSE PLACES.

22:23.429 --> 22:26.519
THAT'S SHOCKING.[singsongy] OH.

22:26.519 --> 22:28.521
[bed squeaking][normal voice] OH. OH, WOW.

22:28.521 --> 22:31.872
THAT IS A GOOD BED
FOR A MOTEL ROOM. VERY FIRM.

22:31.872 --> 22:33.656
UH-HUH.

22:33.656 --> 22:35.789
YOU, UH... YOU WANNA TRY IT?

22:35.789 --> 22:37.573
OH, COME ON.

22:37.573 --> 22:40.663
WHAT? THERE'S NOBODY HERE.
WE CAN LOCK THE DOOR.

22:40.663 --> 22:42.056
NOBODY'S LOOKING.[sighs]

22:42.056 --> 22:44.537
COME ON.WE'RE ON DUTY.

22:44.537 --> 22:46.713
YEAH, I KNOW.
TOTALLYWRONG.

22:48.671 --> 22:50.281
[laughs] COME ON.

22:50.281 --> 22:53.197
[laughs][closes drawer]

22:53.197 --> 22:55.852
WHAT?

22:55.852 --> 22:57.724
HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

23:01.684 --> 23:04.078
WHAT YOU GOT?

23:04.078 --> 23:06.123
EUREKA.

23:06.123 --> 23:09.300
YEAH, EUREKA. NOW DOES THAT MEAN
YOU CAN GET BACK HERE?

23:09.300 --> 23:11.694
THIS COULD BE
CRITICAL EVIDENCE.YES, IT COULD BE,

23:11.694 --> 23:13.957
BUT UNLESS THE CRITICAL EVIDENCE
SELF-DESTRUCTS

23:13.957 --> 23:16.003
IN LESS THAN TEN SECONDS,

23:16.003 --> 23:18.179
I SUGGEST
YOU GET YOURSELF BACK HERE.[pats bed]

23:18.179 --> 23:20.834
IT'S CRITICAL.

23:20.834 --> 23:22.662
[laughs]

23:22.662 --> 23:25.273
[giggles] FINE.

23:25.273 --> 23:28.015
[bed squeaks]

23:28.015 --> 23:30.017
MM. MM.MM.

23:30.017 --> 23:31.758
[door opens]

23:31.758 --> 23:33.760
OOH.[door creaks]

23:33.760 --> 23:35.762
[clears throat]

23:35.762 --> 23:37.328
[clears throat]

23:37.328 --> 23:39.156
ROOM'S GOOD. THANK YOU.YEAH.

23:41.724 --> 23:43.204
[knock on door]

23:43.204 --> 23:45.685
[Hightower] COME IN.

23:49.340 --> 23:50.951
MA'AM, I ASSURE YOU,

23:50.951 --> 23:53.475
TODAY'S INCIDENT IS NOT
AT ALL INDICATIVE

23:53.475 --> 23:56.913
OF THE UNIT'S
OVERALL CONFIDENCE.

23:56.913 --> 24:00.351
YOU HAD A BAD DAY,
AGENT LISBON.

24:00.351 --> 24:01.744
YOU SCREWED UP.

24:01.744 --> 24:03.746
IT HAPPENS.

24:03.746 --> 24:06.314
NOW LET'S GET TO THE WORK.

24:06.314 --> 24:08.534
THIS JUDGE,
THE ONE WHO CHANGED HIS MIND

24:08.534 --> 24:10.666
ABOUT GIVING US
OUR SEARCH WARRANT--

24:10.666 --> 24:12.494
JUDGE WITHERS, MA'AM.

24:12.494 --> 24:14.235
HE'S KINDA LIKE
A STUBBORN OLD BULL--

24:14.235 --> 24:16.542
WON'T BUDGE
ONCE HE TAKES A POSITION.

24:16.542 --> 24:19.980
I'M TRYING TO GET HIM
ON THE PHONE.AND HE CHANGED HIS MIND
BECAUSE?

24:19.980 --> 24:22.591
HE SAID WE HADN'T MET
THE THRESHOLD.

24:22.591 --> 24:24.854
NOT WHAT HE SAID.

24:24.854 --> 24:26.508
THE REAL REASON.

24:28.249 --> 24:29.729
[sighs]

24:29.729 --> 24:31.731
PATRICK JANE INSULTED
HOPPER BANKS,

24:31.731 --> 24:35.474
AND HOPPER BANKS COMPLAINED.JANE HAS UNUSUAL METHODS,
BUT--

24:35.474 --> 24:37.519
HE CLOSES CASES,
YES, HE DOES.

24:37.519 --> 24:40.653
HE'S A VALUABLE ASSET.
WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE HIM.

24:40.653 --> 24:42.829
THE WAY I SEE IT...

24:42.829 --> 24:46.049
[sighs] IT'S YOU
THAT'S IN A TRICKY SPOT.

24:46.049 --> 24:48.487
MA'AM?

24:48.487 --> 24:51.098
THIS BUREAU HAS SEEN
SOME TOUGH TIMES LATELY.

24:51.098 --> 24:54.188
MY MISSION IS TO TURN THAT
AROUND AND MAKE THE CBI

24:54.188 --> 24:58.714
THE PREMIER LAW ENFORCEMENT
AGENCY IN THIS STATE.

24:58.714 --> 25:00.934
PATRICK JANE IS A HUGE PART
OF THAT GOAL.

25:05.155 --> 25:07.506
IF YOU CAN'T KEEP HIM
IN LINE,

25:07.506 --> 25:10.160
WE'LL FIND SOMEONE WHO CAN.

25:11.858 --> 25:14.077
YES, MA'AM.

25:14.077 --> 25:16.384
YOU CAN GO.

25:16.384 --> 25:18.342
I'LL GIVE JUDGE WITHERS
A CALL,

25:18.342 --> 25:20.344
GET YOU A WARRANT.

25:20.344 --> 25:24.000
[dialing]

25:24.000 --> 25:27.090
HEY, BOSS. ACCORDING TO
THE INFORMATION SLOCOMBE DUG UP,

25:27.090 --> 25:29.832
LOUIS ANGLET DOESN'T JUST DEAL
IN STOLEN ANTIQUITIES.

25:29.832 --> 25:31.834
HE'S A HIRED GUN,
NEVER INDICTED,

25:31.834 --> 25:33.923
BUT A PRIME SUSPECT
IN THREE KILLS.

25:33.923 --> 25:35.969
AND HE HASN'T LEFT THE COUNTRY.
HE'S STILL HERE.

25:35.969 --> 25:39.407
MULTIPLE I.D.s, MULTIPLE
ARRESTS, BUT NO JAIL TIME.

25:39.407 --> 25:42.323
HE'S A SLIPPERY CUSTOMER.
HE LOOKS GOOD FOR IT.WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE ANGLET IS.

25:42.323 --> 25:44.064
WHAT WE DO KNOW IS

25:44.064 --> 25:46.283
THAT EVERY TIME SLOCOMBE
OPENS HIS MOUTH, HE LIES.

25:46.283 --> 25:48.285
WE'VE GOT A BOLO OUT ON HIM.
IN THE MEANTIME,

25:48.285 --> 25:50.549
LET'S JUST PURSUE
THE CASE WE'RE DEVELOPING.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.638
HOPPER BANKS IS STILL
OUR PRIME SUSPECT.

25:52.638 --> 25:55.118
LET'S CHECK OUT HIS HOUSE
FOR THE GUN.

25:55.118 --> 25:57.860
WE DON'T HAVE A SEARCH WARRANT.WE DO NOW.

25:57.860 --> 26:00.036
HIGHTOWER GOT WITHERS
TO SIGN OFF ON IT.

26:00.036 --> 26:03.170
HEY.HEY, ABOUT THE GUN--
DID YOU FIND ANYTHING?

26:03.170 --> 26:06.129
IF YOU DID, I HOPE YOU KEEP
MY NAME OUT OF IT--GO AWAY, MR. BANDINO.

26:06.129 --> 26:08.784
NOTHING SO FAR.
I GOT SOME MORE GUYS COMING.

26:08.784 --> 26:11.831
IT'S A BIG HOUSE.AGENT LISBON, WHAT IS
THE CBI EQUIVALENT OF SIBERIA?

26:11.831 --> 26:14.877
BECAUSE WHATEVER IT IS,
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GOING.HOLD THAT THOUGHT, MR. BANKS.

26:14.877 --> 26:17.663
LOOK WHAT I FOUND
IN THE HOME OFFICE.

26:17.663 --> 26:20.579
IT'S A PICTURE OF A PROP.IT'S A PICTURE OF A COLT,
DETECTIVE SPECIAL,

26:20.579 --> 26:22.624
.38 CALIBER, 4-INCH BARREL--

26:22.624 --> 26:25.584
THE SAME KIND OF GUN
KILLED OUR VICTIM.A PROP.

26:25.584 --> 26:28.717
WHY DON'T WE SORT OUT WHICH ONE
AT OUR OFFICES, MR. BANKS?

26:28.717 --> 26:31.590
[monitor beeping rhythmically]

26:36.072 --> 26:39.249
[lowered voice] OH, OLIVER,
YOU IDIOT.

26:39.249 --> 26:41.556
YOU BLOODY IDIOT.

26:43.993 --> 26:45.212
[chair scrapes floor]

26:46.866 --> 26:48.824
WHO'S THAT?

26:48.824 --> 26:51.566
COME OUT OR I WILL SHOOT.

26:57.920 --> 27:01.054
UH, I CHECKED FOR YOU.

27:01.054 --> 27:03.012
LIVERPOOL LOST.

27:03.012 --> 27:05.841
BAD SEASON, HUH?

27:05.841 --> 27:07.974
INJURIES.

27:07.974 --> 27:11.107
YOU'RE EXPECTING ME, THEN?

27:11.107 --> 27:12.500
NICE WORK.

27:12.500 --> 27:14.197
OH, YOU DROPPED EVERYTHING,

27:14.197 --> 27:17.940
YOU RISKED YOUR WHOLE CAREER

27:17.940 --> 27:21.814
TO, UH, FIND HIM BEFORE
YOUR COLLEAGUES AT THE YARD.

27:21.814 --> 27:24.251
YOU FOLLOWED US
AFTER HE WAS SHOT.

27:24.251 --> 27:26.470
YOU'RE BOTH LIVERPOOL FANS.

27:26.470 --> 27:29.038
HE'S FAMILY.

27:29.038 --> 27:32.041
YOUR SON?

27:32.041 --> 27:34.261
YEAH.

27:34.261 --> 27:37.612
MY SON.

27:39.396 --> 27:43.183
I WAS NO FATHER TO HIM.

27:43.183 --> 27:45.968
NEVER MARRIED HIS MOTHER.

27:45.968 --> 27:48.405
NEVER SPENT TIME WITH HIM
AT ALL, REALLY.

27:50.190 --> 27:52.409
BUT I KEPT TRACK.

27:52.409 --> 27:54.150
I TRIED.

27:57.110 --> 27:59.068
AND LOOK AT HIM NOW.

28:01.680 --> 28:02.942
LOOK AT MY BOY.

28:04.683 --> 28:08.077
HE WAS
A BRILLIANT YOUNG MAN.

28:08.077 --> 28:10.123
FROM NOTHING,
UNDER HIS OWN STEAM,

28:10.123 --> 28:13.343
HE GOT HIMSELF A SCHOLARSHIP
TO CAMBRIDGE TO STUDY CLASSICS.

28:13.343 --> 28:16.172
THAT'S WHAT GOT HIM INVITED

28:16.172 --> 28:19.132
TO PREVIEW
THE MUSEUM'S NEW COLLECTION.

28:19.132 --> 28:21.395
AND HE STOLE THE RING.

28:21.395 --> 28:24.180
[sighs]
THAT WAS AN IMPULSIVE ACT.

28:24.180 --> 28:25.791
HE'S NOT A THIEF.

28:25.791 --> 28:28.054
HE'S A FOOLISH,
REBELLIOUS KID.

28:28.054 --> 28:30.883
HE TOOK A COPY OF THE RING
IN WITH HIM.

28:30.883 --> 28:33.015
IT WASN'T AN IMPULSIVE ACT.
IT WAS A PLAN.

28:33.015 --> 28:35.452
HE'S NOT A THIEF.

28:35.452 --> 28:37.237
YOU BELIEVE THAT,

28:37.237 --> 28:39.239
AND THAT WAS YOUR PLAN.

28:39.239 --> 28:41.241
IF YOU COULD
JUST TALK TO HIM,

28:41.241 --> 28:43.243
HE'D RETURN THE RING,
BECAUSE HE'S...

28:43.243 --> 28:45.506
AS YOU SAY, NOT A THIEF.

28:45.506 --> 28:48.117
I COULD HAVE.

28:48.117 --> 28:51.642
IF I MADE IT IN TIME,
I COULD HAVE DONE THAT.

28:51.642 --> 28:54.820
AND NOW YOU TRACK DOWN
HIS KILLER

28:54.820 --> 28:56.560
AND KILL THEM.

28:56.560 --> 28:59.520
YEAH, WELL,
YOU KNOW HOW THAT WORKS.

28:59.520 --> 29:01.565
I READ ALL ABOUT YOU,
MR. JANE.

29:01.565 --> 29:04.003
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

29:09.835 --> 29:12.011
WELL,
YOU'LL END UP IN PRISON.

29:12.011 --> 29:14.404
MAYBE.

29:14.404 --> 29:17.016
BUT RIGHT NOW
I'M GONNA WALK OUT OF HERE,

29:17.016 --> 29:19.018
AND YOU'RE GONNA LET ME.

29:19.018 --> 29:21.063
OBVIOUSLY.
YOU'RE HOLDING A GUN,

29:21.063 --> 29:23.762
AND I HAVE NO REAL REASON
TO STOP YOU.

29:23.762 --> 29:25.807
THANKS FOR BEING SENSIBLE.

29:25.807 --> 29:28.679
IT'S MY MIDDLE NAME.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.121
[Patrick clears throat]

29:35.121 --> 29:36.600
HEY.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.254
HEY.

29:38.254 --> 29:40.604
I'M HAVING A PRIVATE WORD
WITH EVERYONE HERE

29:40.604 --> 29:43.172
TO KINDA SET THE TONE.

29:43.172 --> 29:46.175
COOL. IT'S, UH,
AN EXCELLENT PRACTICE.

29:46.175 --> 29:47.524
HAVE A SEAT.

29:47.524 --> 29:49.135
THANK YOU.

29:49.135 --> 29:52.138
I SPOKE
TO LISBON YESTERDAY...MM-HMM.

29:52.138 --> 29:55.924
TOLD HER HOW DEEPLY I VALUE
YOUR CONTRIBUTION TO THE BUREAU.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.145
NICE TO HEAR.

29:59.145 --> 30:01.800
I TOLD HER YOU'RE TOO GOOD
TO LOSE

30:01.800 --> 30:05.151
TO SOME SMART-ASS MOVE
YOU MIGHT MAKE THAT TURNS BAD.

30:05.151 --> 30:08.023
I TOLD HER THAT IF AND WHEN
IT HAPPENS, IT'S HER NECK.

30:10.025 --> 30:11.592
YOU...

30:11.592 --> 30:14.160
YOU'RE GOLDEN.

30:14.160 --> 30:17.250
YOU'RE SAFE FOR ANYTHING
SHORT OF MURDER.

30:17.250 --> 30:20.644
LISBON--NO.

30:20.644 --> 30:23.169
YOU MESS UP,
SHE'S OUT OF HERE.

30:23.169 --> 30:25.040
ANY QUESTIONS?

30:25.040 --> 30:27.608
NOT THAT I CAN THINK OF
RIGHT NOW.

30:27.608 --> 30:30.045
GOOD.

30:30.045 --> 30:32.047
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

30:32.047 --> 30:34.920
I LOOK FORWARD
TO WORKING WITH YOU.

30:34.920 --> 30:37.183
LIKEWISE.

30:37.183 --> 30:40.577
THANK YOU.

30:40.577 --> 30:42.623
SEE YOU AROUND.

30:46.627 --> 30:48.629
I KNEW THE PURCHASE WAS ILLEGAL.

30:48.629 --> 30:51.066
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO GET IN TROUBLE.

30:51.066 --> 30:53.764
IRONIC. [chuckles]

30:53.764 --> 30:57.116
WHERE'S THE GUN NOW?I HAVE NO IDEA. I HAVEN'T
SEEN IT SINCE THE SHOOT,

30:57.116 --> 30:59.945
WHICH IS WHAT,
LIKE SIX WEEKS AGO?

30:59.945 --> 31:02.208
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE
SOMEWHERE IN MY STUDIO,

31:02.208 --> 31:05.864
BUT YOU GUYS WOULD HAVE
FOUND IT, I GUESS.

31:05.864 --> 31:08.040
MAYBE SOMEBODY STOLE IT.THAT'S NOT VERY CREDIBLE.

31:08.040 --> 31:09.650
IT'S THE TRUTH.

31:09.650 --> 31:11.870
BOSS?YEAH.

31:11.870 --> 31:14.698
I WAS GOING THROUGH THE FILES
ON BANKS' LAPTOP,

31:14.698 --> 31:17.658
AND I FOUND THIS AND THIS
IN HIS TELEPHONE RECORDS.

31:20.835 --> 31:23.838
CHO, YOU MIND?

31:23.838 --> 31:26.928
ALL YOURS.

31:26.928 --> 31:30.105
MR. BANKS, DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THE THEFT OF A RING

31:30.105 --> 31:31.759
AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM?

31:31.759 --> 31:33.804
CLEOPATRA'S WEDDING RING,
SUPPOSEDLY.

31:33.804 --> 31:35.197
NO.

31:35.197 --> 31:36.982
WHY?

31:36.982 --> 31:40.289
WE CHECKED YOUR BROWSER HISTORY
ON YOUR OFFICE COMPUTER.

31:40.289 --> 31:43.336
YOU LOOKED UP THE THEFT
OF THE RING TWO MONTHS AGO,

31:43.336 --> 31:46.295
RIGHT AFTER YOU LET STANS
MOVE INTO YOUR POOL HOUSE.

31:46.295 --> 31:49.603
DOWNLOADED QUITE A BIT
ABOUT IT.

31:51.561 --> 31:53.389
I NEVER DID THIS.

31:53.389 --> 31:55.391
YOU ALSO MADE
SEVERAL PHONE CALLS

31:55.391 --> 31:57.393
TO A MAN NAMED LOUIS ANGLET,

31:57.393 --> 32:00.092
WHO WE BELIEVE MAY HAVE
PURCHASED THE RING.

32:00.092 --> 32:03.182
ANGLET?
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF HIM.

32:03.182 --> 32:05.793
THE CALLS ARE
IN YOUR PHONE RECORDS.

32:07.838 --> 32:10.145
I PAID FOR OVERNIGHT DELIVERY.

32:10.145 --> 32:13.018
I WAS TOLD GUARANTEED DELIVERY
BEFORE 10:00 A.M.

32:13.018 --> 32:15.063
AND IT'S NOT HERE YET.

32:15.063 --> 32:18.066
WELL, IF IT GETS HERE BY THEN
THAT'LL BE FINE. THANK YOU.

32:18.066 --> 32:21.113
NO WORD ON SLOCOMBE?NEVER DESPAIR.
VAN PELT BRINGS HOPE.

32:21.113 --> 32:24.246
UH, WE'VE BEEN TRACKING
THIS ANGLET GUY VIA CELL PHONE.

32:24.246 --> 32:26.596
OFF THAT, WE GOT A BEAD
ON HIS CREDIT CARD.

32:26.596 --> 32:29.643
THE THING IS, SOMEONE ELSE IS
TRACKING HIS PURCHASES AS WELL.

32:29.643 --> 32:31.471
HAS TO BE SLOCOMBE.

32:31.471 --> 32:34.256
AND AT 3:00 THIS AFTERNOON,
ANGLET HAS A MASSAGE BOOKED

32:34.256 --> 32:36.998
AT THE BLUE WILLOW SPA, RIGHT
HERE IN DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO.

32:36.998 --> 32:38.957
MM-HMM. AND CHANCES ARE...

32:38.957 --> 32:40.436
SLOCOMBE WILL SHOW UP.

32:40.436 --> 32:43.352
SO GOOD.

32:51.230 --> 32:55.103
I GOT ANGLET.

32:55.103 --> 32:56.800
[sighs]

32:56.800 --> 32:58.063
BOTTLE OF WATER, PLEASE.

33:03.590 --> 33:05.026
[lowered voice] I SEE SLOCOMBE.

33:05.026 --> 33:07.594
ANGLET?

33:07.594 --> 33:10.510
WHAT?GOT A QUESTION FOR YOU.

33:10.510 --> 33:14.079
OH, SORRY, I THINK YOU HAVE
THE WRONG GUY, BUT--HEY.DID YOU KILL MY BOY?

33:14.079 --> 33:16.168
NO.DID YOU KILL MY BOY?

33:16.168 --> 33:18.561
GET OFF ME![thud]

33:18.561 --> 33:22.000
[Rigsby] CBI! ON THE GROUND![Cho] SLOCOMBE!
SLOCOMBE, DROP THE WEAPON!

33:22.000 --> 33:24.002
[crowd screams]DROP IT!

33:25.655 --> 33:26.961
[Slocombe grunts]

33:34.534 --> 33:37.406
I JUST MEANT TO QUESTION HIM.

33:37.406 --> 33:41.410
I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAME OVER ME.
I SAW RED.

33:41.410 --> 33:43.238
I'LL END UP IN PRISON,
JUST LIKE YOU PREDICTED.

33:43.238 --> 33:44.805
[scoffs] VERY FOOLISH.

33:44.805 --> 33:46.937
NO.

33:46.937 --> 33:48.635
IT'S HUMAN NATURE.

33:48.635 --> 33:51.464
AH, IT MADE ME REALIZE
REVENGE IS NOT FOR ME.

33:51.464 --> 33:53.857
POINTLESS. MORE VIOLENCE IS
JUST MORE VIOLENCE.

33:53.857 --> 33:55.859
DOESN'T MAKE ANYTHING
ANY BETTER.

33:55.859 --> 33:57.644
MM, MAYBE.

33:57.644 --> 33:59.602
I'M NOT SO, UH...

33:59.602 --> 34:03.171
YOU'RE BOOKED ON THE 8:00
TO LONDON TOMORROW MORNING.

34:03.171 --> 34:06.392
TAKE IT, AND THERE'LL BE
NO CHARGES PENDING.THANK YOU.

34:06.392 --> 34:08.698
I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
CLEAR?

34:08.698 --> 34:10.787
OH, YES, MA'AM.

34:10.787 --> 34:12.398
THANK YOU.

34:16.576 --> 34:19.144
UH, TH-THAT'S MINE.

34:21.581 --> 34:23.017
YEP.[pen clicks]

34:29.545 --> 34:32.461
FRANCIS SLOCOMBE, THE MAN
WHO WAS TRYING TO KILL YOU--

34:32.461 --> 34:33.810
WHY WAS THAT?

34:33.810 --> 34:36.422
I HAVE NO IDEA.

34:36.422 --> 34:38.641
WE KNOW THAT SLOCOMBE WAS TRACKING YOU.

34:38.641 --> 34:41.079
WE KNOW THAT YOU CAME HERE FOR THE RING.

34:41.079 --> 34:43.516
THIS RING MUST BE
VERY IMPORTANT.

34:43.516 --> 34:47.128
ANGLET'S LAWYER'S HERE. EVERYONE HERE SEEMS
TO BE TALKING ABOUT IT.

34:47.128 --> 34:50.566
WHAT KIND OF RING IS IT?AGENT LISBON.

34:50.566 --> 34:52.351
EXCUSE ME.

34:55.876 --> 34:58.705
[whistles and inhales sharply]

34:58.705 --> 35:01.882
HE'S TOUGH.YEAH, WELL, THERE'S A REASON
WHY HE HASN'T BEEN IN JAIL.

35:01.882 --> 35:03.536
THAT'S HIS ATTORNEY.

35:03.536 --> 35:05.581
PROBABLY GETS ABOUT
$1,500 AN HOUR.

35:05.581 --> 35:08.541
LET'S SPEND A LITTLE TIME
WITH HIM, RUN UP THE METER.

35:13.241 --> 35:15.243
EXCUSE ME.
I'M AGENT LISBON.

35:15.243 --> 35:18.681
WOULD YOU COME TO MY OFFICE
WITH ME, PLEASE? JUST UP HERE.

35:30.693 --> 35:32.173
HI.

35:32.173 --> 35:36.308
WHOA. YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE
MY LAWYER.

35:36.308 --> 35:39.180
I'LL TAKE THAT
AS A COMPLIMENT.I'M NOT GONNA ANSWER
ANY MORE QUESTIONS.

35:39.180 --> 35:41.051
NO MORE QUESTIONS.

35:41.051 --> 35:44.054
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T KILL STANS.
YOU'RE TOO SMART FOR THAT.

35:44.054 --> 35:47.057
BUT WHAT YOU DID DO IS YOU
BOUGHT CLEOPATRA'S WEDDING RING

35:47.057 --> 35:49.147
FROM HIS KILLER.OH, THECLEOPATRA?

35:49.147 --> 35:52.454
REALLY? QUEEN OF THE NILE,
THE BRIDE OF MARK ANTONY?

35:52.454 --> 35:55.457
[increases volume] AND HERE'S WHAT YOU GOT--

35:55.457 --> 35:56.937
ONE OF THESE...

35:56.937 --> 35:59.635
$39 FAKIES.

35:59.635 --> 36:03.117
CONSIDERABLY MORE IF YOU HAVE TO GET THE OVERNIGHT DELIVERY.

36:03.117 --> 36:04.553
NOT YOUR FAULT.

36:04.553 --> 36:07.513
NO REASON TO THINK
IT WAS A FAKE, OBVIOUSLY.

36:07.513 --> 36:09.689
STANS DID STEAL THE RING.

36:09.689 --> 36:11.691
THAT'S WHY
IT'S SUCH A GREAT SCAM.

36:11.691 --> 36:15.564
HE CAN SELL THE SAME RING
OVER AND OVER.

36:15.564 --> 36:18.654
NOW THE PERSON YOU BOUGHT
THE RING FOR--

36:18.654 --> 36:22.658
I'M GUESSING THEY PAID MORE
THAN $39 FOR IT.

36:22.658 --> 36:25.661
HOW MUCH DID THEY PAY FOR IT?
HUH?

36:25.661 --> 36:28.621
$200,000?

36:30.536 --> 36:32.886
MORE?

36:32.886 --> 36:34.975
MORE THAN $200,000?

36:34.975 --> 36:36.977
OHH.

36:36.977 --> 36:38.979
I THINK
THEY'RE GONNA BE PRETTY MAD

36:38.979 --> 36:41.329
WHEN THEY FIND OUT
IT'S A FAKE.

36:41.329 --> 36:44.463
OHH! WHAT DO YOU THINK?

36:44.463 --> 36:46.682
[laughs] OH, MAN.

36:46.682 --> 36:50.077
YOU CAN GO NOW, MR. ANGLET.
YOUR ATTORNEY'S WAITING.

36:53.167 --> 36:54.516
SEE YOU.

36:57.867 --> 36:59.608
YOU STAY.

36:59.608 --> 37:01.001
OH, I'M STAYING.

37:01.001 --> 37:03.830
THE PHONE
AND INTERNET EVIDENCE SUGGESTS

37:03.830 --> 37:07.921
THAT HOPPER KILLED STANS FOR
THE RING AND SOLD IT TO ANGLET.YES, IT DOES SUGGEST THAT.

37:07.921 --> 37:10.706
SO YOU JUST PUT HOPPER
IN A GREAT DEAL OF DANGER.

37:10.706 --> 37:13.622
[whispers] NAH.

37:13.622 --> 37:15.276
[whispers] NAH?

37:15.276 --> 37:17.235
[normal voice]
THAT'S YOUR CONSIDERED REPLY?

37:17.235 --> 37:19.672
YEP.

37:19.672 --> 37:22.675
PUT A GUARD ON HOPPER ASAP.WILL DO, BOSS.

37:22.675 --> 37:25.025
YOU KNOW, THIS IS EXACTLY

37:25.025 --> 37:27.549
THE KIND OF SCENARIO
WE TALKED ABOUT.HMM.

37:27.549 --> 37:30.248
DIDN'T THINK
WE'D GET THERE SO SOON.

37:31.771 --> 37:34.252
YOU BUTT IS ON THE LINE,
AGENT LISBON.

37:39.648 --> 37:41.389
WHAT DID YOU DO?

37:41.389 --> 37:44.174
PAID WAY TOO MUCH
FOR OVERNIGHT DELIVERY.

37:44.174 --> 37:46.351
MAYBE WE SHOULD CONSIDER...

37:46.351 --> 37:50.137
PROTECTIVE CUSTODY?
NO. NO WAY.I'LL PUT A TEAM TOGETHER, SIR.

37:50.137 --> 37:53.227
FULL PROTECTION 24/7,
MY 4 BEST GUYS.

37:53.227 --> 37:56.143
MR. BANKS,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND--SURE, I DO. YOU PEOPLE CONVINCED
ANGLET THAT I CHEATED HIM,

37:56.143 --> 37:58.580
AND THEN TURNED HIM LOOSE
TO KILL ME.

37:58.580 --> 38:01.409
THAT PRETTY MUCH HOW IT GOES?YEAH, THAT'S--THAT'S
PRETTY MUCH HOW IT GOES.

38:01.409 --> 38:03.324
BUT FOR THE RECORD,

38:03.324 --> 38:06.458
AGENT LISBON HAD ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.JANE--

38:06.458 --> 38:09.374
HOW GALLANT.IT WAS ALL MY IDEA.
A-AND WE COULD HAVE HELD ANGLET

38:09.374 --> 38:11.419
IF YOU WERE MAN ENOUGH
TO ADMIT

38:11.419 --> 38:14.596
SELLING HIM THE RING
IN THE FIRST PLACE.THAT'S IT. GET OUT.

38:14.596 --> 38:16.729
YOU BETTER PRAY
NOTHING HAPPENS TO MY FAMILY.

38:28.523 --> 38:30.612
[engine sputters]

38:30.612 --> 38:32.222
OH, COME ON.

38:37.924 --> 38:40.883
[grunts][grunts]

38:40.883 --> 38:43.756
[both grunting]

38:45.410 --> 38:47.890
WHERE IS IT?

38:47.890 --> 38:50.110
I WANT THE REAL RING NOW.

38:50.110 --> 38:52.939
[panting] WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT? I GAVE IT TO YOU.

38:52.939 --> 38:54.941
YOU SOLD ME THE FAKE.

38:54.941 --> 38:57.073
I WANT THE REAL ONE NOW.

38:57.073 --> 38:59.598
I... I GAVE YOU THE REAL ONE,
ALL RIGHT?

38:59.598 --> 39:02.557
TRUST ME. I PUT A GUN
IN THAT GUY'S FACE.

39:02.557 --> 39:04.646
THERE'S NO WAY
HE'D HAND OVER A FAKE.

39:04.646 --> 39:06.866
[sirens wail][Lisbon] PUT THE GUN DOWN!

39:06.866 --> 39:10.435
[Rigsby] DROP THE GUN!ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
HEY, WHAT DID I DO?

39:10.435 --> 39:13.699
I JUST HELPED YOU CATCH
THE GUY. ALL RIGHT, RELAX.ON THE GROUND!

39:13.699 --> 39:16.702
[Van Pelt] PUT YOUR HANDS
ON YOUR HEAD.LET'S SEE YOUR HANDS.
UP AGAINST THE TRUCK, BANDINO.

39:16.702 --> 39:19.531
GO! GO!
LET'S SEE YOUR HANDS.

39:20.967 --> 39:22.708
VICTOR BANDINO,

39:22.708 --> 39:25.624
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR THE MURDER OF OLIVER STANS.

39:28.757 --> 39:31.194
YEAH, YOU THINK
BEING A COP'S STRESSFUL?

39:31.194 --> 39:33.283
TRY BEING A COP IN PRISON,
JERK.

39:33.283 --> 39:35.808
[police radio chatter]

39:38.463 --> 39:39.899
I KNOW MY JOB.

39:39.899 --> 39:42.292
I DO GOOD BACKGROUND CHECKS.

39:42.292 --> 39:45.208
I FOUND OUT THAT SMITHSON
WAS REALLY STANS,

39:45.208 --> 39:47.254
FOUND OUT ABOUT THE RING.

39:47.254 --> 39:49.256
I APPROACHED HIM.
WE TALKED.

39:49.256 --> 39:51.650
HE COULDN'T SELL THE RING.
IT WAS TOO HOT.

39:51.650 --> 39:54.261
BUT I KNOW SOME PEOPLE
WHO KNOW SOME PEOPLE

39:54.261 --> 39:57.220
THAT PUT ME IN TOUCH
WITH ANGLET, AND THAT WAS IT.

39:57.220 --> 39:58.744
I BROKERED THE DEAL.

39:58.744 --> 40:01.355
WHY'D YOU KILL STANS?

40:01.355 --> 40:04.489
HE CHANGED HIS MIND.

40:04.489 --> 40:06.621
DIDN'T WANT TO SELL IT.

40:06.621 --> 40:10.190
AT THE LAST MINUTE,
THE IDIOT WANTED TO CONFESS,

40:10.190 --> 40:12.235
RETURN IT TO THE MUSEUM.

40:12.235 --> 40:14.237
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

40:14.237 --> 40:16.065
YOU SHOT HIM.

40:18.938 --> 40:20.548
I HAD NO CHOICE.

40:20.548 --> 40:23.246
IT WAS
A SPUR OF THE MOMENT THING.

40:23.246 --> 40:26.467
RIGHT. NO PREMEDITATION,
NO DEATH PENALTY.

40:26.467 --> 40:29.252
THE ONLY THING?
YOU PLANNED AHEAD.

40:29.252 --> 40:31.646
YOU PLANTED THE PHONE
AND INTERNET EVIDENCE

40:31.646 --> 40:34.649
ON HOPPER BANKS.
THAT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.050
BYE, SON.

40:46.835 --> 40:48.620
OKAY.

41:06.768 --> 41:09.858
WELL, IT APPEARS I WAS...
WRONG ABOUT YOUR SON.

41:09.858 --> 41:13.558
HE WASN'T A THIEF.
HE WANTED TO RETURN THE RING.

41:13.558 --> 41:16.778
ANGLET CUT A DEAL,

41:16.778 --> 41:18.650
TRADED FOR HIS FREEDOM.

41:18.650 --> 41:20.826
WAY OF THE WORLD.

41:20.826 --> 41:23.263
YEAH. IT DOESN'T FEEL
ANY BETTER.

41:23.263 --> 41:25.787
KNOWING WHO KILLED HIM,
KNOWING HE'LL BE PUNISHED--

41:25.787 --> 41:27.920
IT DOESN'T MAKE
A DAMN BIT OF DIFFERENCE.

41:27.920 --> 41:30.313
I THOUGHT IT WOULD.

41:30.313 --> 41:31.924
BUT THIS...

41:31.924 --> 41:34.535
IS WHAT HE WANTED.

41:34.535 --> 41:37.059
I CAN GIVE THAT TO HIM NOW,
THANKS TO YOU.

41:37.059 --> 41:38.974
EH.

41:38.974 --> 41:41.586
WELL,

41:41.586 --> 41:43.588
I BETTER NOT MISS MY PLANE.

41:43.588 --> 41:45.590
TIME TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

41:45.590 --> 41:47.940
YEAH. GOOD-BYE.

41:47.940 --> 41:50.638
I WASN'T GONNA HUG YOU.

41:50.638 --> 41:52.597
I KNOW. JUST MAKING SURE.

41:54.729 --> 41:59.691
[Lisbon] OH, NO.[Patrick] THERE WAS
A CERTAIN VULNERABILITY,

41:59.691 --> 42:01.823
A CERTAIN RUMPLED GENTLENESS
TO HIM.

42:01.823 --> 42:04.347
VULNERABILITY?

42:04.347 --> 42:06.611
MM, I THOUGHT SO.

42:06.611 --> 42:09.439
YEAH.

42:09.439 --> 42:12.007
COMFORTABLE?

42:12.007 --> 42:14.270
I'M GETTING THERE, YEAH.

42:17.143 --> 42:19.580
REGARDING
AGENTS RIGSBY AND VAN PELT--

42:19.580 --> 42:22.583
THEY'RE
IN A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP.

42:22.583 --> 42:25.368
WELL, I...
WELL, ROMANTIC?

42:25.368 --> 42:28.371
YOU'RE TOO GOOD OF A COP
NOT TO HAVE NOTICED,

42:28.371 --> 42:30.939
AND SINCE YOU HAVEN'T DONE
ANYTHING ABOUT IT,

42:30.939 --> 42:32.941
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
TAKE ACTION MYSELF.

42:32.941 --> 42:36.205
JUST WANTED
TO LET YOU KNOW FIRST.

42:36.205 --> 42:38.338
GOOD NIGHT.

42:38.338 --> 42:40.122
GOOD NIGHT.

42:50.611 --> 42:52.265
SHE'S GOOD.

42:58.750 --> 43:01.535
STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.
