00:44.480 --> 00:46.630
- May I help you?
- Number please?

00:46.840 --> 00:48.558
- Yes, number please?
- Number please?

00:48.640 --> 00:50.949
I'm connecting you now. Go ahead, sir.

00:51.040 --> 00:54.237
<i>Help!</i>

00:55.200 --> 00:57.760
<i>Help!</i>

01:01.160 --> 01:02.912
<i>Help!</i>

01:04.920 --> 01:07.559
I said no calls while Mr Lowe is here.

01:10.440 --> 01:12.795
Sorry, Isaac. You were saying?

01:13.040 --> 01:14.951
The campaign's tilted in my favour, yes?

01:15.040 --> 01:19.033
Indeed, your opponent has foolishly
come out against the subway project.

01:19.120 --> 01:22.396
Excellent! But what did we expect
from a backward thinking blowhard

01:22.480 --> 01:23.913
like Ellis Cornwall?

01:24.000 --> 01:26.673
Which is why you
are the right candidate for alderman.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.956
"Brackenreid. Right the ship. " Eh?

01:29.080 --> 01:30.638
Clear sailing from here, I'd say.

01:30.720 --> 01:34.235
Ah, but the voting public is fickle,
if it's even thinking at all.

01:34.320 --> 01:37.232
To that end, your campaign
wants you out there stumping,

01:37.320 --> 01:41.074
driving home your vision
of Toronto's world-class future.

01:41.680 --> 01:42.669
I'm ready.

01:42.760 --> 01:45.149
- Let me at that gobshite Cornwall.
- That's the spirit.

01:45.240 --> 01:48.789
But first a little
sprucing wouldn't hurt.

01:49.480 --> 01:50.595
- Sprucing?
- Yes.

01:50.680 --> 01:54.275
Your campaign wants your public image
as bright as a new button.

01:54.520 --> 01:57.239
- And what does this sprucing involve?
- Well, for starters,

01:57.320 --> 02:00.118
I will have my tailor come over
and measure you for a new suit.

02:00.720 --> 02:04.156
- A new suit? And who's paying for that?
- Don't you worry about that.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.277
That's very
generous of you, Isaac.

02:06.400 --> 02:08.709
We are going to
knock 'em dead, Inspector.

02:08.840 --> 02:10.795
I will see you soon.

02:11.039 --> 02:12.029
Yes, you will.

02:17.640 --> 02:21.679
And that's when I plugged into the jack
and heard that awful sound.

02:22.080 --> 02:25.675
- That poor woman being murdered.
- Murdered? Are you sure?

02:25.800 --> 02:27.153
Yes! Strangled!

02:28.080 --> 02:30.640
- I have very good hearing.
- Oh, really?

02:31.560 --> 02:34.154
And do you remember where this
telephone call came from?

02:34.320 --> 02:35.912
Number 2315.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.592
Ahem.

02:38.360 --> 02:40.157
- You again?
- It's Miss Moffat.

02:40.240 --> 02:41.992
Tess Moffat, Inspector.

02:42.800 --> 02:46.031
Sir, Miss Moffat believes
she overheard a murder last night.

02:46.120 --> 02:49.874
A murder this time? Well, I'll put
my best man on that immediately.

02:50.080 --> 02:52.310
Murdoch? Miss Moffat.

02:52.840 --> 02:56.276
This murder is the fourth imaginary
incident you've wasted our time with.

02:56.520 --> 03:01.230
A tiny reminder, you're not a policeman.
You're a telephone operator.

03:02.840 --> 03:05.479
Then you are aware that I am breaking
telephone company rules

03:05.560 --> 03:08.154
by repeating what I overheard.
Good day, Inspector.

03:11.600 --> 03:12.749
Sir?

03:12.880 --> 03:16.429
We are obliged to look into
any reports of criminal activity.

03:17.840 --> 03:22.118
More than five minutes on this, Murdoch,
and you'll be a telephone operator.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.679
Bloody woman.

03:25.640 --> 03:28.108
Did Miss Moffat happen to recall
the number, George?

03:28.240 --> 03:30.595
She did, sir. 2315.

03:30.880 --> 03:33.110
Should be here in the reverse directory.

03:35.440 --> 03:36.839
240 Walnut Street.

03:43.400 --> 03:45.675
- Constable?
- Uh, the back door was open, sir.

03:47.040 --> 03:48.837
- Oh.
- Do come in.

04:08.240 --> 04:11.312
There doesn't seem to be anything
out of the ordinary, sir.

04:11.440 --> 04:14.079
I suppose Miss Moffat
has cried wolf once again.

04:14.320 --> 04:15.548
Hmm.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.718
Uh, just a moment, George.

04:27.640 --> 04:30.518
- What are you looking at, sir?
- If I'm not mistaken...

04:31.520 --> 04:32.748
this is blood.

04:36.520 --> 04:38.511
- George, search the house.
- Yes, sir.

04:38.600 --> 04:40.113
Explain yourselves.

04:41.080 --> 04:44.231
Detective William Murdoch,
Toronto Constabulary. And you are?

04:44.320 --> 04:46.436
Mrs Handsworth,
Mr Whittaker's housekeeper,

04:46.800 --> 04:48.552
and I asked you for an explanation.

04:49.200 --> 04:51.509
We believe something untoward
has occurred in this home.

04:51.680 --> 04:54.513
That is impossible.
Mr Whittaker is a fine Christian man.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.556
And where is Mr Whittaker now?

04:56.640 --> 04:58.756
He left on business for Chicago
three days ago.

04:58.880 --> 05:00.233
Madam, is there any chance
you may have left

05:00.320 --> 05:01.469
the back door unlocked last evening?

05:01.880 --> 05:02.915
None whatsoever.

05:03.080 --> 05:05.799
Goodness,
has Mr Whittaker been burgled?

05:06.280 --> 05:09.238
We are not sure.
Who else has access to the home?

05:09.400 --> 05:11.311
I have the only key
apart from Mr Whittaker.

05:12.320 --> 05:14.959
Then do you have any idea
where this drop of blood came from?

05:16.640 --> 05:18.278
I'm sure I don't.

05:19.280 --> 05:22.511
Miss Moffat, what exactly did you hear
on Mr Whittaker's line?

05:22.600 --> 05:25.592
I heard the sound
of a woman being strangled.

05:26.880 --> 05:29.758
- Ah! Pardon me, Miss Moffat, Constable.
- Sir.

05:30.120 --> 05:31.678
- Miss.
- Thank you.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.238
Detective Murdoch.

05:36.480 --> 05:38.118
Yes, I placed the call to Chicago.

05:45.160 --> 05:47.549
Oh, my! Will you look at that?

05:48.280 --> 05:50.919
- Is this a finger mark kit?
- Why, yes, it is.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.319
How fascinating.

05:52.760 --> 05:55.274
Have you ever caught a criminal
using finger marks, Constable?

05:55.440 --> 05:58.830
Yes, as a matter of fact we have.
It's an extremely useful tool.

05:58.920 --> 06:00.956
Everyone in the world
has unique fingers.

06:01.080 --> 06:05.039
Uh, I should get back
to my duties though.

06:09.120 --> 06:11.475
Oh! Thank you, Constable.

06:11.600 --> 06:13.397
Of course, Miss Moffat.

06:13.720 --> 06:15.711
Whittaker is still in Chicago, sir.

06:15.880 --> 06:17.996
He's been there on business
for the past three...

06:18.600 --> 06:21.034
Are you quite sure
this is a good time, sir?

06:21.240 --> 06:24.835
You can't be in politics without
paying attention to your image, Murdoch.

06:24.960 --> 06:27.110
- Go on.
- Yes, sir.

06:27.280 --> 06:31.512
Whittaker confirms that only he and
his housekeeper have keys to the house.

06:31.600 --> 06:32.953
Has she checked that
nothing was missing?

06:33.040 --> 06:34.029
She has.

06:34.280 --> 06:36.430
Well, that rules out burglary.

06:36.600 --> 06:39.194
Any reports on a missing woman,
or a dead one for that matter?

06:39.280 --> 06:41.999
- No, sir.
- Hmm. Why am I not surprised?

06:42.360 --> 06:46.069
Sir, the drop of blood
on Whittaker's desk remains a mystery.

06:46.680 --> 06:48.318
What do you think, Murdoch?

06:48.720 --> 06:51.154
Brown? Blue?
Or what about the pin-stripe?

06:53.200 --> 06:54.474
Too modern?

06:54.560 --> 06:56.915
Sirs... Uh, no, sir.

06:57.880 --> 07:00.110
A body's been found
near Sherbourne and Bloor, sir.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.871
There you go, Murdoch,
a real case.

07:02.960 --> 07:05.394
Not some figment
of a girl's imagination.

07:07.440 --> 07:08.793
Pin-stripe.

07:14.440 --> 07:17.034
I came around the corner
and saw him lying there.

07:17.600 --> 07:18.919
It gave me the shock of my life.

07:19.720 --> 07:22.188
And what were you doing
in the laneway, Mr Phillips?

07:22.480 --> 07:25.472
I'm a city worker,
I was inspecting a gas line.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.236
Never expected
to find something bad like this.

07:29.520 --> 07:30.635
Detective?

07:32.000 --> 07:33.319
Excuse me.

07:39.360 --> 07:42.670
- He's so young.
- Yes, I know. This must be difficult.

07:48.040 --> 07:49.951
There seems to be some bruising,

07:50.040 --> 07:52.600
but a small inconsistency
in the ligature marks.

07:52.840 --> 07:56.276
He was strangled,
possibly by a thin rope that was frayed.

07:56.360 --> 07:59.796
- And the time of death?
- In the last 12 to 18 hours.

08:00.720 --> 08:03.029
I discovered something quite unusual.

08:03.280 --> 08:06.352
- The clothes don't match the boy.
- How do you mean?

08:06.720 --> 08:09.234
He had a deficiency
in mineralised calcium.

08:09.320 --> 08:12.073
Rickets, generally
a disease of the poor.

08:12.720 --> 08:16.349
- Yes, perhaps he stole the clothes.
- Perhaps.

08:25.320 --> 08:27.151
Have you seen him?
Have you seen him?

08:33.000 --> 08:35.467
- Thank you.
- Sir? Down there.

08:36.559 --> 08:38.152
Oi!

08:54.600 --> 08:56.431
What's your name, lad?

09:02.000 --> 09:03.991
Dorrie, think hard.

09:05.360 --> 09:07.590
Have you seen this boy before?

09:09.040 --> 09:10.758
We need to contact his parents.

09:10.840 --> 09:12.990
Let them know
what's become of their boy.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.399
Can I go now?

09:17.560 --> 09:20.791
One more question.
Why did you run, Dorrie?

09:21.160 --> 09:24.152
Street boys always
get the blame for something.

09:24.280 --> 09:25.474
Don't matter what.

10:00.400 --> 10:03.278
A milliner's?
What's a street boy doing buying hats?

10:03.720 --> 10:06.553
Well, sir, I spoke to the shop owner,
a Miss Elisabeth Lurton.

10:06.680 --> 10:07.715
She's a kindly soul.

10:07.800 --> 10:10.917
She lets Dorrie use her telephone
on Monday's and Fridays at 11:00,

10:11.000 --> 10:12.752
to receive a call from his uncle.

10:12.840 --> 10:14.159
Is that so?

10:14.240 --> 10:17.596
The little angel has a kindly old uncle
who telephones regularly.

10:17.720 --> 10:19.950
This Dorrie's got more on the go
than he's letting on, Murdoch.

10:20.080 --> 10:23.038
Yes, sir, I believe he lied when he said
he didn't know the dead boy.

10:23.120 --> 10:26.237
Well, sirs, perhaps we should listen in
to the lad's next call on Monday.

10:26.880 --> 10:28.108
- Listen in?
- Yes, sir.

10:28.200 --> 10:31.397
The Milliner's shop is on the
Temperance Street telephone exchange.

10:31.520 --> 10:33.875
- Now that's where Miss Moffat works...
- Give me strength, Crabtree.

10:33.960 --> 10:37.270
Well, sir, I could supervise the call,
that way it's official police business

10:37.360 --> 10:38.998
and she won't be risking her employment.

10:39.480 --> 10:42.836
If we involve her in a murder
investigation and it goes wrong...

10:43.520 --> 10:44.794
Well, I am running
for alderman, you know.

10:45.520 --> 10:46.509
We know.

10:47.680 --> 10:51.309
Sir, I'm confident George
will manage his plan with success.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.359
- Operator.
- Connecting you now.

11:12.440 --> 11:14.476
- Go ahead, sir.
- Connecting you now.

11:16.920 --> 11:18.990
- Number, please?
- That line is unavailable.

11:19.080 --> 11:20.229
An incoming call,

11:20.640 --> 11:23.279
from the public telephones
at the junction exchange.

11:23.920 --> 11:26.992
<i>- I've a call for 1098.
- Thank you, operator.</i>

11:28.680 --> 11:30.636
1098, the milliner's number.

11:31.960 --> 11:33.598
<i>Top Hats Millinery.</i>

11:33.680 --> 11:36.877
<i>Good morning, Madam,
I'm calling for my nephew, Dorrie.</i>

11:37.040 --> 11:38.268
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

11:38.520 --> 11:41.273
<i>- Hello?
- Hello, Dorrie. Are you well?</i>

11:41.480 --> 11:47.077
<i>- I am, Uncle. Are we meeting today?
- Yes, 159, Castle Frank Road.</i>

11:47.280 --> 11:49.919
<i>The usual time.</i>

11:50.640 --> 11:53.438
A street boy with an uncle
living up in posh Rosedale?

11:53.520 --> 11:56.512
- That doesn't add up.
- Will you stake out the house?

11:56.600 --> 11:57.396
"Stake out"?

11:57.920 --> 11:59.672
It's a phrase I learned
in the penny dreadfuls.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.955
- It means to watch.
- Oh, I know.

12:02.040 --> 12:03.109
What are you doing?

12:03.200 --> 12:05.077
Well, you've just given me an idea now
for my adventure novel.

12:05.160 --> 12:06.878
Adventure novel?

12:06.960 --> 12:09.315
- May I read it?
- Perhaps when I'm done.

12:09.600 --> 12:11.033
Oh, I can wait.

12:11.880 --> 12:13.916
Well, then,
Detective Murdoch will decide

12:14.000 --> 12:15.956
whether or not we stake out
the Castle Frank house.

12:16.040 --> 12:19.271
- Might I be able to come along?
- No, absolutely not.

12:19.640 --> 12:21.949
- I have very good eyesight.
- Really?

12:22.240 --> 12:24.879
No. Miss Moffat, civilians
cannot become involved,

12:24.960 --> 12:27.155
especially the fairer sex.
It's far too dangerous.

12:27.240 --> 12:31.358
I'll keep you abreast of any...
Of anything... Of any goings on.

12:47.880 --> 12:49.438
Hello, Dorrie.

12:50.800 --> 12:52.119
What have we here?

12:55.400 --> 12:57.277
Please, sir, don't arrest me.

12:58.960 --> 13:00.029
They'll kill me, too.

13:05.280 --> 13:08.033
Right. Let's try this again.

13:08.720 --> 13:10.392
Did you know the dead boy?

13:13.480 --> 13:16.074
Young man, you were caught
with stolen property.

13:16.240 --> 13:18.629
You'll spend a great deal more time
in a prison cell

13:18.720 --> 13:20.358
if you don't start cooperating.

13:21.600 --> 13:22.749
Pip.

13:23.640 --> 13:26.108
- Pip was his name.
- And how did you know him?

13:26.800 --> 13:28.597
He robbed houses, too.

13:28.920 --> 13:31.275
You said, "They'll kill me, too. "

13:31.920 --> 13:33.717
Who are "they"?

13:33.800 --> 13:36.553
The men we work for. They're rough.

13:37.640 --> 13:39.358
Dorrie, who are "they"?

13:39.600 --> 13:41.909
Who is this uncle
you speak to twice a week?

13:42.040 --> 13:44.395
I don't know.

13:44.480 --> 13:47.119
A man telephones and gives us addresses.

13:47.440 --> 13:49.749
We rob the house and
leave the jewellery at a drop place.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.312
- You never meet?
- No.

13:54.120 --> 13:56.680
- Where's Pip now?
- He's in the morgue.

13:58.400 --> 13:59.913
Can I see him?

14:00.720 --> 14:02.312
We were friends.

14:06.040 --> 14:08.838
- Did he have family?
- Not that he said.

14:12.280 --> 14:15.352
- He'll be buried proper, right?
- Yes. Yes, of course.

14:15.640 --> 14:17.232
He was a smart one.

14:17.920 --> 14:21.037
- He could read. Taught me some, too.
- Really?

14:21.560 --> 14:23.790
He said that if we wanted out
of the thieving life

14:23.880 --> 14:25.871
we'd have to learn our letters better.

14:26.320 --> 14:28.311
Maybe they found out
and killed him for it.

14:29.960 --> 14:31.109
Dorrie, I know you're scared,

14:32.000 --> 14:34.878
but cooperating with Detective Murdoch
is your way out now.

14:35.400 --> 14:37.789
Yeah, if they don't catch me first.

14:40.840 --> 14:43.718
<i>- Gulliver's Travels, do you know it?
- I've seen it at the library.</i>

14:45.360 --> 14:48.636
I go and look at all the books
until the throw me out.

14:49.240 --> 14:51.470
It's a wonderfully imaginative tale.

14:52.560 --> 14:54.312
Why don't you borrow it?

14:54.400 --> 14:56.072
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

14:56.680 --> 14:58.113
Thank you.

14:58.960 --> 15:00.109
I'll bring it back.

15:03.640 --> 15:05.517
Right then, Dorrie, come along.

15:11.320 --> 15:13.993
Marvellous speech at the Rotary Club
last night, may I say.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.355
You put Cornwall solidly in his place.

15:16.440 --> 15:20.797
Though it might be an idea to tone
down some of your colourful language.

15:20.880 --> 15:22.108
- Tone down?
- It's just so that,

15:22.200 --> 15:24.270
"My esteemed opponent, Ellis Cornwall",

15:24.360 --> 15:27.557
doesn't become, "Ellis Cornwall,
that bloody little tosser. "

15:27.640 --> 15:28.914
- But...
- One more thought here.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.912
Let's consider Tommy
as the name to call you.

15:32.080 --> 15:33.672
Tommy? Are you serious?

15:33.760 --> 15:35.591
Tommy is a man of the people.

15:35.760 --> 15:38.911
<i>Thomas plays tennis with his
opera-loving bon vivants.</i>

15:39.000 --> 15:39.989
I see!

15:40.080 --> 15:42.719
And we may need to do a little work
on that accent of yours.

15:42.800 --> 15:45.951
- Accent?
- Let's try enunciating more clearly.

15:47.760 --> 15:51.196
"Oh, Horace, isn't it horrid
when you're hot and in a hurry

15:51.280 --> 15:53.589
"and you have to hold your hat on
with your hand. "

15:54.000 --> 15:55.274
Now you, Tommy.

15:57.560 --> 16:02.315
"Oh, Horace, isn't it horrid
when you're hot and in a hurry

16:02.440 --> 16:04.670
"and you have to hold your hat on
with your hand. "

16:05.480 --> 16:08.199
I don't see how this bloody posh accent
is gonna make me a man of the people.

16:08.280 --> 16:10.032
We must be all things to all people.

16:10.120 --> 16:11.997
Will you trust me, Tommy?
I've done this before.

16:12.120 --> 16:14.588
Excuse me, Isaac. Urgent business.

16:16.080 --> 16:17.752
- Murdoch?
- Sir?

16:19.600 --> 16:22.751
You've got something urgent
for me, right? Yes?

16:23.840 --> 16:26.513
- Sir?
- You've got something, Murdoch, for me?

16:28.760 --> 16:31.115
Ah, yes. Yes. Most urgent, sir.

16:31.200 --> 16:33.270
I spoke with Dorrie.

16:33.480 --> 16:35.948
Apparently he and Pip, the boy who died,

16:36.160 --> 16:37.673
were working for jewellery thieves,

16:37.800 --> 16:39.392
but there have been
no reports of burglaries.

16:40.280 --> 16:42.510
A bit strange if thieves
are running around town.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.477
You sure this Dorrie's
not telling tall tales?

16:44.560 --> 16:46.835
Well, sir, I did catch him
with stolen valuables.

16:47.040 --> 16:49.315
It would be in his best interest
to tell us the truth.

16:49.400 --> 16:51.755
I'm not convinced you ever
get the whole truth from that kind.

16:52.920 --> 16:56.151
Sirs, Mr Whittaker called.
He's back from Chicago.

17:13.880 --> 17:19.079
I have no idea what happened, Detective.
It's all very confusing.

17:19.599 --> 17:23.036
Blood on my desk,
the back door unlocked.

17:23.760 --> 17:25.671
I'm as mystified as you.

17:26.680 --> 17:29.433
How long has Mrs Handsworth
been in your employ, Mr Whittaker?

17:29.600 --> 17:30.635
Five years.

17:30.720 --> 17:33.518
You'll find no impropriety there.
Her credentials are impeccable.

17:35.480 --> 17:37.630
And you're quite sure
nothing's missing from the home?

17:37.720 --> 17:39.836
Nothing Mrs Handsworth
may have overlooked?

17:39.960 --> 17:41.678
Everything is just as I left it.

17:41.800 --> 17:44.598
My gold cufflinks
in plain view on my bureau.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.911
Cash in my desk drawer.

17:47.240 --> 17:48.912
Nothing is missing.

17:49.240 --> 17:52.118
Well, perhaps it's simply
a misunderstanding then.

17:52.200 --> 17:53.519
So it seems.

17:53.760 --> 17:55.751
I do appreciate your
thoroughness though, Detective.

17:55.840 --> 17:58.559
Oh, excuse me.

18:01.520 --> 18:02.714
Hello?

18:03.320 --> 18:06.118
Yes, I returned from
Chicago this morning.

18:06.840 --> 18:10.310
I will be at the office
within the hour, yes. Thank you.

18:12.200 --> 18:14.509
I apologise for the interruption.

18:16.080 --> 18:19.470
I'll be needing to
take your telephone, Mr Whittaker.

18:20.080 --> 18:21.149
Whatever for?

18:21.520 --> 18:24.034
This fray on Mr Whittaker's
telephone line exposed the wires.

18:24.720 --> 18:28.076
It matches the inconsistent
ligature marks on Pip's neck.

18:28.720 --> 18:32.679
So it was Pip that Miss Moffat heard
being strangled, not a woman.

18:33.280 --> 18:36.272
He was small enough to get in
through the milk box.

18:37.400 --> 18:40.153
Could he have been sent
to rob Whittaker's home?

18:40.440 --> 18:41.919
It's possible.

18:42.280 --> 18:44.475
Perhaps Pip's killer
caught him in the act,

18:44.640 --> 18:47.677
and then suffered a cut
in the ensuing struggle.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.871
But who is the killer?

18:49.960 --> 18:53.111
These criminals who take
advantage of destitute children,

18:53.720 --> 18:55.995
and the parents
who abandon them...

18:56.800 --> 18:59.439
I can't imagine.

18:59.520 --> 19:01.636
Everyone has their story, Julia.

19:06.080 --> 19:08.640
Well, at least Dorrie
seems to have a future.

19:09.320 --> 19:10.912
Let's hope.

19:11.200 --> 19:13.589
I've been looking for books
that he might like.

19:13.920 --> 19:17.071
<i>Perhaps you should wait for
Gulliver's Travels to make its way...</i>

19:17.160 --> 19:19.469
William, don't be such a pessimist.

19:20.280 --> 19:21.838
Now you must excuse me.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.513
I'm joining Darcy at the hospital

19:23.600 --> 19:26.990
for a presentation on
the draining of infected wounds.

19:31.880 --> 19:34.235
Are you sure Whittaker had nothing
to do with this, Murdoch?

19:34.320 --> 19:36.117
The boy was killed in his house.

19:36.280 --> 19:38.748
Yes, sir, but Whittaker was in Chicago
at the time of the murder.

19:38.840 --> 19:40.512
I spoke to him there myself.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.353
Fair enough.

19:42.680 --> 19:45.319
If the dead boy
was part of the jewel theft ring

19:45.400 --> 19:47.436
maybe we should
find out how it operates.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.159
Starting by identifying
this elusive uncle.

19:50.800 --> 19:51.949
How do you intend to do that?

19:52.040 --> 19:55.112
Well, sir, the thieves don't know
that Dorrie is cooperating with us.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.270
- What if Miss Moffat...
- Not her again.

19:57.880 --> 19:59.438
That girl's a bloody pest.

19:59.600 --> 20:02.194
But what if she were to trace Dorrie's
next telephone call.

20:02.280 --> 20:04.714
Miss Moffat said that the uncle
telephoned Dorrie

20:04.800 --> 20:07.109
from a public telephone
at the junction exchange.

20:07.320 --> 20:08.673
He may do so again.

20:08.760 --> 20:11.274
I was thinking I could stake out
the junction exchange

20:11.360 --> 20:13.271
- on Friday at 11:00 am.
- "Stake out"?

20:13.400 --> 20:14.879
Yes, sir, it means to watch.

20:14.960 --> 20:17.793
Very good, George, you can be
on the telephone with Miss Moffat,

20:17.880 --> 20:20.440
and she can then tell you
when Dorrie speaks to the uncle.

20:20.640 --> 20:22.835
You'll then be able to identify the man
at the junction exchange.

20:22.920 --> 20:26.071
Yes, sir. I assume
this will call for plain clothes.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.275
Yes, George, I suppose it will.

20:30.160 --> 20:32.151
I'll agree to this caper
on one condition, Murdoch,

20:32.240 --> 20:34.515
that Miss Moffat does not
leave her switchboard.

20:34.680 --> 20:35.999
Actually, sir, for this plan to work

20:36.080 --> 20:38.310
it's imperative
that she remain at her post.

20:38.920 --> 20:41.673
She's part of this once,
and this once only.

20:41.920 --> 20:43.194
The question is,

20:43.280 --> 20:45.840
can we trust that little stray
not to queer the plan?

20:48.200 --> 20:50.236
Pip was in the house in Rosedale?

20:50.760 --> 20:53.035
Do you have any idea
why he might have been there?

20:53.360 --> 20:56.318
No. He did his thieving in Parkdale.

20:58.240 --> 20:59.912
Do you think I was right?

21:00.000 --> 21:02.150
One of the men we rob for killed him?

21:02.280 --> 21:05.556
It's a possibility, that's why we'll be
listening to your phone call.

21:05.880 --> 21:09.077
Now, it's important that you
speak and act naturally.

21:10.400 --> 21:13.472
This "uncle" mustn't suspect
that we're on to him.

21:14.480 --> 21:15.799
All right.

21:31.440 --> 21:33.556
Under five miles, please?

21:43.160 --> 21:44.991
Temperance Street exchange, please?

21:45.080 --> 21:47.310
Yes, try back later, please.

21:48.120 --> 21:50.680
<i>- Number please.
- Miss Moffat?</i>

21:51.520 --> 21:53.112
Hello, Constable Crabtree.

21:53.560 --> 21:54.879
I'll let you know
when the call comes through.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.470
<i>- The password is "goldfish".
- "Goldfish", excellent.</i>

22:04.560 --> 22:06.596
Number, please?

22:06.680 --> 22:09.194
<i>- 1098.
- Connecting you now, sir.</i>

22:11.840 --> 22:12.829
Goldfish.

22:13.320 --> 22:14.309
Goldfish.

22:14.760 --> 22:15.909
<i>Goldfish! Goldfish! Goldfish!</i>

22:16.040 --> 22:18.634
Uh, yes, I hear you.
Which booth is he calling from?

22:18.720 --> 22:20.233
<i>I can't tell.</i>

22:22.120 --> 22:24.395
Well, let me know
when Dorrie ends the call.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.670
Good thinking, Constable Crabtree.

22:29.680 --> 22:31.636
They're just finishing now.

22:33.680 --> 22:35.113
Oh, for the love of...

22:41.320 --> 22:43.311
I followed the suspect all the way
to the court house

22:43.400 --> 22:46.198
where I discovered he is, in fact,
Judge Benjamin Hooper.

22:46.800 --> 22:49.917
Somehow I doubt his lordship
is involved in a jewellery theft ring.

22:50.120 --> 22:52.475
You had a 50-50 chance
of being right, George.

22:52.560 --> 22:56.439
Perhaps you'll find the man you
didn't follow in our Bertillon photos.

23:04.280 --> 23:07.590
- Crabtree's sifting through photographs.
- Yes, sir.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.509
I take it his grand plan fizzled.

23:13.040 --> 23:16.953
Oh! Oh, sir, that is quite a suit.

23:17.520 --> 23:20.990
- Thank you, Murdoch. Not too...
- Ostentatious?

23:21.760 --> 23:22.909
- No, not at all.
- Good.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.195
Because Isaac Lowe wants
to show off his spruced up candidate

23:25.280 --> 23:26.759
with a picture in the newspaper.

23:26.880 --> 23:29.314
So, if you catch
those jewellery thieves...

23:29.400 --> 23:31.834
It's a perfect opportunity
to call in the press.

23:31.920 --> 23:33.399
Ah! Indeed.

23:33.920 --> 23:35.558
I'll be in my office.

23:45.680 --> 23:47.750
You followed the wrong man,
Constable Crabtree.

23:47.880 --> 23:50.348
Yes, I'm aware of that Miss Moffat.
Thank you for the reminder though.

23:50.480 --> 23:53.313
After you left the junction exchange,
I stayed on the line.

23:53.600 --> 23:56.558
Dorrie's contact, the uncle,
made another call

23:56.640 --> 23:59.950
to his brother at the Union Station
Exchange public telephones.

24:00.560 --> 24:01.788
How do you know
it was the uncle's brother?

24:01.880 --> 24:02.949
He called him that.

24:03.040 --> 24:04.632
They seemed to be
discussing their family,

24:04.720 --> 24:06.438
but I suspect otherwise.

24:06.560 --> 24:09.120
- Do you?
- The man at Union Station said,

24:09.280 --> 24:11.748
"Grandad wants to know
what's happened to his nephew. "

24:11.840 --> 24:13.990
The man at the junction telephone,
the uncle,

24:14.080 --> 24:15.672
then replied that he didn't know.

24:15.760 --> 24:19.150
The Union Station man then said,
"Grandad's very unhappy.

24:19.440 --> 24:21.271
"His Bible is missing. "

24:21.920 --> 24:25.196
Yes, I see what you mean. It sounds like
they're speaking some sort of code.

24:25.280 --> 24:27.475
As I suspected.
Did he say anything else?

24:27.560 --> 24:28.993
Yes, they agreed to meet.

24:29.080 --> 24:31.275
"Usual time at our mother's. "

24:31.840 --> 24:33.831
- You think that's code, too?
- Very likely.

24:33.960 --> 24:35.678
I doubt their talking about
an actual family member.

24:35.760 --> 24:38.877
- A public house?
- I can't think of one called Mother.

24:39.440 --> 24:42.432
Could it be Our Mother
of Divine Sorrow Church in Parkdale?

24:42.760 --> 24:44.478
I'll inform Detective Murdoch
of this immediately.

24:44.560 --> 24:45.834
Miss Moffat, this has been very helpful.

24:45.920 --> 24:48.115
Please, call me Tess, Constable.

24:48.280 --> 24:49.952
Tess, call me George.

24:57.200 --> 24:59.794
Goodness, George,
there's a body.

25:05.080 --> 25:06.115
Oh!

25:06.760 --> 25:08.432
Sir, this is...

25:08.520 --> 25:10.511
This is the man I didn't follow
from the telephone exchange.

25:10.600 --> 25:13.273
- This is Dorrie's uncle.
- George...

25:13.680 --> 25:17.798
This is Randolph Phillips, the man
who claims to have found Pip's body.

25:18.320 --> 25:19.719
Then he's also involved
in the jewellery theft ring.

25:19.800 --> 25:21.472
That's hardly a coincidence, sir.

25:21.560 --> 25:22.629
Indeed.

25:22.720 --> 25:26.679
- Do you think he killed Pip, then?
- Yes, I do. The question is, why?

25:27.920 --> 25:30.036
He appears to have been tortured.

25:30.200 --> 25:33.078
That's normally employed
to extract information.

25:33.760 --> 25:37.548
I wonder what secret Mr Phillips thought
was worth dying over.

25:44.040 --> 25:46.315
"One twelfth the size
of normal human beings. "

25:46.600 --> 25:49.831
It means the Liliputians
are 12 times smaller than Gulliver.

25:50.600 --> 25:53.956
So they're about
five or six inches tall, then.

25:54.760 --> 25:57.593
Exactly! You're quick with mathematics.

25:57.680 --> 26:00.148
Once I learn my letters better
I want to be an apprentice.

26:00.600 --> 26:03.990
- And what would you like to do?
- I fancy work in a printer's shop.

26:04.400 --> 26:08.393
Well, knowing your figures
will serve you well, Dorrie.

26:11.560 --> 26:14.358
Why don't you try
another chapter of Mr Swift?

26:14.440 --> 26:15.429
I will.

26:16.080 --> 26:18.071
Good. Now I have to work.

26:18.960 --> 26:20.473
Some work, huh?

26:21.520 --> 26:22.953
See you later.

26:25.440 --> 26:28.352
The wounds are unusual, William.
I don't know what caused them.

26:28.440 --> 26:30.396
Some very particular instrument.

26:30.680 --> 26:33.433
But there's no question,
Mr Phillips was tortured.

26:33.680 --> 26:37.036
- And then finished off.
- I doubt it got that far.

26:37.200 --> 26:38.997
He had a heart defect.

26:39.080 --> 26:41.514
The pain of being tortured
triggered a fatal heart attack.

26:41.640 --> 26:44.154
So it's possible that he died

26:44.240 --> 26:47.118
before giving up the information
his assailant was after.

26:47.200 --> 26:48.792
Yes, poor man.

26:49.080 --> 26:50.638
Oh, there's no need
for sympathy, Julia.

26:50.720 --> 26:53.393
I believe Mr Phillips here
murdered young Pip.

26:54.320 --> 26:56.072
Oh, I see.

27:00.480 --> 27:02.436
Be sure to encourage
Inspector Brackenreid

27:02.520 --> 27:04.670
to stand up straight for the camera.

27:05.640 --> 27:09.553
He has a tendency
to drop his head forward somewhat.

27:10.720 --> 27:13.280
It makes him look like a surly bulldog.

27:21.560 --> 27:23.994
The elusive jewellery thieves, I assume.

27:24.080 --> 27:27.311
Yes, sir. I believe they are organised
in a hierarchy.

27:27.760 --> 27:30.433
The young boys, known as nephews,
commit the robberies.

27:30.720 --> 27:32.551
Then report back to the middle men.

27:32.640 --> 27:35.837
Phillips in this case, who is the uncle
and his brother.

27:36.040 --> 27:37.792
And at the head is Grandad.

27:37.880 --> 27:40.440
Yes, well, some of this homicidal horde

27:40.520 --> 27:43.751
have a horrible habit
of getting themselves murdered.

27:45.920 --> 27:48.992
Got you there, Murdoch.
Hardly any accent at all.

27:49.480 --> 27:51.038
Yes, sir, hardy any at all.

27:51.160 --> 27:54.357
Sirs, reports of jewellery thefts
are trickling in across the city.

27:54.520 --> 27:56.670
All from wealthy folks
who've just returned from holidays.

27:57.040 --> 27:59.600
So their Toronto homes
had been vacant for several weeks.

27:59.800 --> 28:02.360
Which explains why the robberies
weren't reported earlier.

28:02.680 --> 28:04.671
But how do the thieves know
which properties were empty?

28:04.800 --> 28:05.789
Someone in their gang

28:05.880 --> 28:07.836
must be familiar with
the neighbourhoods they're targeting.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.797
Also, I've been checking in
with the pawn shops.

28:09.880 --> 28:12.713
- None of the jewellery is showing up.
- No, it wouldn't, George.

28:12.880 --> 28:15.030
I believe this is a
sophisticated operation,

28:15.120 --> 28:16.758
headed by a fence who either

28:16.840 --> 28:20.037
holds on to the stolen property
or has buyers elsewhere.

28:20.120 --> 28:21.951
How does this connect
to the murders of Pip and Phillips?

28:25.040 --> 28:26.996
Ah! Excuse me, gentlemen

28:27.160 --> 28:29.515
but I have to have my blooming
publicity photograph taken.

28:30.080 --> 28:31.513
Keep me informed.

28:34.360 --> 28:38.717
Sir, I can't help notice the inspector's
language has become less salty of late.

28:38.920 --> 28:40.273
That it has, George.

28:40.600 --> 28:42.079
I think I liked him better
the way he was.

28:46.400 --> 28:47.719
Constable Crabtree.

28:47.800 --> 28:50.155
<i>George, the man who was
on the telephone with Mr Phillips,</i>

28:50.240 --> 28:52.231
<i>- he's right here at the exchange.
- Well, who is it?</i>

28:53.640 --> 28:55.358
Tess? Tess?

29:00.280 --> 29:03.636
Number please? Yes, sir.
Connecting you now.

29:03.720 --> 29:05.870
Go ahead, sir. You're welcome.

29:06.240 --> 29:07.832
Number, please? Yes.

29:09.680 --> 29:10.715
Yes, ma'am, and...

29:20.080 --> 29:21.433
- He's there, right there.
- What the Dickens.

29:21.520 --> 29:22.509
He's right there.
He's right there.

29:23.200 --> 29:25.111
His name is Josiah Lawrence.
He's a telephone installer.

29:25.520 --> 29:26.839
How do you know
he was talking to Phillips?

29:26.920 --> 29:28.194
I heard him chatting
to one of the operators.

29:28.280 --> 29:29.838
I recognised his voice plain as day.

29:29.920 --> 29:32.957
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I have a very good memory.

29:33.720 --> 29:34.948
So do I.

29:36.840 --> 29:39.832
George, don't let him get away.
Go! Go!

29:40.000 --> 29:41.558
Sir! You there!

29:42.120 --> 29:44.429
Toronto Constabulary,
you're under arrest.

29:44.880 --> 29:47.189
What in blazes for?

29:47.800 --> 29:49.552
Just come with me.

29:58.440 --> 30:00.158
You've arrested the wrong man.

30:00.600 --> 30:03.592
Mr Lawrence,
do you know a Randolph Phillips?

30:04.760 --> 30:06.034
I do not.

30:06.600 --> 30:09.990
I insist you let me go. I am late for my
shift at the Toronto Telephone Company.

30:11.040 --> 30:13.076
Where you are a telephone installer?

30:14.520 --> 30:16.511
What has my job got to do with anything?

30:16.600 --> 30:18.909
It gives you access to people's homes,
does it not?

30:20.360 --> 30:22.078
Why are you asking?

30:22.160 --> 30:24.594
Mr Lawrence, do you know this boy?

30:28.480 --> 30:29.674
My Lord!

30:33.320 --> 30:34.719
I've never seen him before.

30:44.880 --> 30:46.438
This man was pulled off the street

30:46.520 --> 30:48.556
based on one of
Miss Moffat's wild fantasies.

30:48.640 --> 30:50.153
Do I have that right?

30:50.360 --> 30:52.590
Thought so. Let him go.

30:53.400 --> 30:57.075
Sir, Miss Moffat was right about
the killing at the Whittaker house,

30:57.160 --> 31:01.631
and she's also correct about Josiah
Lawrence arranging to meet Phillips.

31:01.840 --> 31:04.195
He is, in all likelihood,
a brutal killer.

31:04.520 --> 31:08.115
Well, then, hold him and find some
connection to Phillips or the dead boy

31:08.200 --> 31:10.430
apart from Tess Moffat.
Is that clear?

31:19.280 --> 31:20.793
Do you recognise this man?

31:23.920 --> 31:26.559
I've seen him talking to Pip
a few days before he was killed.

31:27.080 --> 31:28.354
Do you know what he wanted?

31:31.160 --> 31:33.116
Pip told me that it was
none of my business.

31:34.160 --> 31:37.789
And then the next time I saw him
he was wearing new clothes.

31:37.880 --> 31:39.233
Is that who killed him?

31:41.440 --> 31:43.874
I don't know, Dorrie. I don't know.

31:47.040 --> 31:52.398
So, Lawrence supplied the addresses of
the homes that were vacant to Phillips.

31:52.480 --> 31:55.313
Phillips then tells the boys
which households to rob.

31:55.640 --> 31:56.914
And so why was Pip killed, sir?

31:58.400 --> 32:01.597
Pip was hired by Lawrence to do a job
that didn't involve Phillips.

32:01.680 --> 32:03.272
Deviation from the usual pattern.

32:03.360 --> 32:05.430
Well, maybe that job involved
breaking into the Whittaker house.

32:06.000 --> 32:06.989
Perhaps.

32:07.200 --> 32:08.428
But then Whittaker said
nothing was taken.

32:09.480 --> 32:11.675
Well, George, Whittaker claimed
that nothing was stolen.

32:11.760 --> 32:15.230
What if Pip was hired to steal something
from Whittaker's home

32:15.320 --> 32:17.436
that Whittaker didn't want
the police knowing about?

32:17.520 --> 32:19.909
Sir, are you suggesting that Whittaker
is involved with the jewel thieves?

32:22.360 --> 32:25.796
George, could Whittaker be the Grandad?

32:26.680 --> 32:28.477
Is it possible he's the fence?

32:28.560 --> 32:30.994
And Lawrence sends Pip
to his house to find what?

32:31.440 --> 32:33.271
Perhaps it's this "Bible"

32:33.360 --> 32:36.318
that Lawrence referred to
in his telephone call with Phillips.

32:36.520 --> 32:39.557
Whatever this "Bible" is,
it was worth killing Phillips over.

32:40.480 --> 32:42.869
So how do we prove any of this, sir?

32:42.960 --> 32:46.111
Well, George, these thieves
communicate by telephone.

32:46.520 --> 32:49.273
I wonder who
Whittaker has been talking to.

32:49.360 --> 32:51.590
Well, sir, perhaps the Inspector
will reconsider now

32:51.680 --> 32:54.194
and allow Miss Moffat
to listen in to Whittaker's calls.

32:54.280 --> 32:55.429
George, I have another plan

32:55.640 --> 32:58.552
and we've been ordered
to steer clear of Miss Moffat.

32:59.200 --> 33:01.191
Mr Whittaker? A fence?

33:01.280 --> 33:04.556
It's just a theory, Tess.
And you didn't get that from me.

33:04.640 --> 33:07.029
I could get into a lot of trouble
for even speaking to you right now.

33:07.120 --> 33:10.396
That's so sweet.
Why are you talking to me then?

33:11.200 --> 33:13.111
I thought you deserved to know,
I suppose.

33:13.200 --> 33:14.679
Thank you, George.

33:15.560 --> 33:18.950
You should tell Detective Murdoch
to smoke Mr Whittaker out.

33:19.160 --> 33:20.354
- "Smoke him out"?
- Yes.

33:20.520 --> 33:22.431
Trap him into
saying something incriminating.

33:22.520 --> 33:24.715
You have to lure him in, George.

33:24.800 --> 33:26.518
Make him think
you know more than you do.

33:28.080 --> 33:29.638
It's in interesting idea, Tess,
but please,

33:29.720 --> 33:31.233
let's just leave it at that for now.

33:31.800 --> 33:34.997
Oh, George,
where's your sense of adventure?

33:36.320 --> 33:40.074
I've arranged with the telephone company
to route all of Mr Whittaker's calls

33:40.160 --> 33:41.718
here to the station house.

33:42.040 --> 33:44.952
That way, the moment Whittaker
picks up his phone

33:45.040 --> 33:49.909
to either place or receive a call,
this recording device will be activated,

33:50.480 --> 33:54.473
signalled by a flashing...
Flashing light.

33:54.920 --> 33:57.673
So Whittaker's calls will be recorded
and we'll be able to hear them?

33:57.840 --> 34:02.391
Yes, sir. All of this will take place
without our having to attend to it.

34:02.800 --> 34:06.554
Good, 'cause I need your advice
on a matter of some importance.

34:06.640 --> 34:08.277
- Sir?
- Follow me.

34:12.280 --> 34:15.272
Be honest, now.
Which is the most flattering?

34:18.040 --> 34:20.679
- Uh, well...
- Just decide, Murdoch.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.027
This one.

34:26.120 --> 34:28.395
You look like a bulldog, sir.

34:28.920 --> 34:32.514
That's my favourite one, too.
It says, "I listen. "

34:32.760 --> 34:35.797
As well as,
"My mind is already made up. "

34:36.080 --> 34:37.911
That it does, sir. That it does.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.831
- That should satisfy Isaac.
- Sirs?

34:39.920 --> 34:44.391
The light on the recorder is flashing.
Mr Whittaker must have received a call.

34:47.040 --> 34:48.792
<i>I know what you're doing,
Mr Whittaker.</i>

34:48.920 --> 34:51.036
<i>I know about your part
in the jewellery theft.</i>

34:51.120 --> 34:52.838
<i>I know everything you've been up to.</i>

34:53.040 --> 34:54.393
Oh, my God, that's Tess.

34:54.480 --> 34:55.754
<i>- Who is this?
- What?</i>

34:55.840 --> 34:57.671
What's that girl doing
talking to Whittaker?

34:57.760 --> 35:00.320
<i>I will explain everything
when we meet, Mr Whittaker.</i>

35:00.400 --> 35:03.551
<i>I know how to find you.
I know where you live.</i>

35:04.880 --> 35:07.110
Sir, I swear, I had no idea.

35:13.400 --> 35:16.392
It sounds like Little Miss Bloody Moffat
is after a piece of the action herself.

35:16.520 --> 35:19.159
No, sir, I think she's
trying to help our investigation

35:19.280 --> 35:20.599
by smoking out Whittaker.

35:20.720 --> 35:21.869
"Smoking out"?

35:21.960 --> 35:24.679
"Smoking out"? Face it, Crabtree,
this is all your doing.

35:24.800 --> 35:25.949
"Smoking out"!

35:26.040 --> 35:29.430
In any case I think it's best if we
get over to Whittaker's right away.

35:29.560 --> 35:30.788
Sir?

35:31.200 --> 35:33.111
Mr Whittaker's telephone.

35:35.640 --> 35:37.870
<i>What are you
doing in my house? Who sent you?</i>

35:37.960 --> 35:39.871
<i>- Never mind who sent me.
- Oh, God! Tess!</i>

35:40.000 --> 35:41.194
Bloody hell, she's in the house.

35:41.280 --> 35:43.794
Sir, I believe she's
taken the phone off the hook.

35:43.960 --> 35:46.190
<i>- This is happening now.
- I believe we can help each other.</i>

35:46.280 --> 35:47.872
<i>Who sent you?
Was it Lawrence?</i>

35:47.960 --> 35:49.552
<i>What if I know
where your Bible is?</i>

35:49.840 --> 35:51.637
<i>Where's my book?</i>

35:51.720 --> 35:54.314
<i>- I don't know. Please.
- Oh, God!</i>

36:01.680 --> 36:03.079
Here's your prisoner, George.

36:03.160 --> 36:05.799
Thank God you're here.
This woman is insane.

36:05.880 --> 36:08.030
Tess, what on Earth were you thinking?
You could have been killed.

36:08.120 --> 36:11.112
Oh, don't over-dramatise, George.
I knew you could hear every word.

36:11.200 --> 36:12.918
All of the operators knew
that Mr Whittaker's calls

36:13.000 --> 36:15.992
- were rerouted to the police station.
- She came at me unprovoked.

36:16.320 --> 36:17.309
She's dangerous.

36:17.720 --> 36:20.154
Mr Whittaker,
you are under arrest for larceny

36:20.560 --> 36:22.437
and for the murder
of Randolph Phillips.

36:22.800 --> 36:24.074
Phillips, who's that?

36:24.680 --> 36:26.238
- George.
- With pleasure, sir.

36:26.320 --> 36:27.992
- Come on.
- What the devil?

36:29.040 --> 36:30.792
She attacked me!

36:35.400 --> 36:36.958
<i>Where's my book?</i>

36:37.040 --> 36:39.508
<i>I don't know. Please.</i>

36:40.480 --> 36:41.959
The missing book.

36:42.800 --> 36:47.635
Your "Bible" contains the information
you need to fence the stolen property.

36:48.280 --> 36:49.998
Does it not, Mr Whittaker?

36:50.160 --> 36:52.720
And that is why
you tortured Randolph Phillips.

36:52.800 --> 36:56.998
I am not a fence and I did not
kill this Phillips person.

36:58.400 --> 37:01.198
My men are
searching your home right now,

37:01.520 --> 37:05.513
and I'm confident that they'll find
a significant amount of stolen property.

37:06.440 --> 37:10.069
Where were you planning to fence
the stolen jewellery, Mr Whittaker?

37:10.440 --> 37:11.668
Chicago?

37:15.080 --> 37:17.036
I'll speak to my lawyer now.

37:18.080 --> 37:20.389
Someone wanted to squeeze Whittaker
out of the jewellery theft ring.

37:20.480 --> 37:21.469
Who was it?

37:21.680 --> 37:23.432
I believe Josiah Lawrence, sir.

37:23.520 --> 37:26.637
All he would have needed was
Whittaker's contact book to take over.

37:26.720 --> 37:28.915
And he hired Pip to break
into Whittaker's flat to steal it?

37:29.280 --> 37:32.397
Yes, but I believe Whittaker
suspected Phillips, not Lawrence.

37:32.680 --> 37:34.352
So Whittaker killed Phillips?

37:34.520 --> 37:37.318
Sirs, I checked out
Whittaker's alibi for Phillips' murder.

37:37.520 --> 37:39.795
He was at his office.
He didn't kill Phillips.

37:39.960 --> 37:41.871
- That leaves Josiah Lawrence.
- Correct, sir.

37:41.960 --> 37:44.633
So, on a bit of a flyer, I went by
the Temperance Street exchange

37:44.840 --> 37:46.398
to have a look through
Lawrence's tool bag.

37:46.480 --> 37:49.756
And I did find one implement
you might find of particular interest.

37:51.400 --> 37:52.879
The teeth on your linesmen pliers

37:52.960 --> 37:56.839
match the wounds
on Phillips' tortured body exactly.

37:58.280 --> 38:00.236
Our coroner confirms it.

38:00.880 --> 38:03.599
You were planning on cutting Whittaker
out of the jewel theft ring.

38:03.680 --> 38:04.795
Weren't you?

38:04.880 --> 38:07.075
You paid Pip to steal his contact book.

38:08.800 --> 38:10.392
Did your associate, Mr Phillips,

38:10.480 --> 38:12.630
find out what you were planning to do?
Hmm?

38:14.880 --> 38:16.791
Phillips followed Pip
to Whittaker's house,

38:16.880 --> 38:18.916
killed him and took the book.

38:19.400 --> 38:22.631
That's why you tortured Phillips
to get the book back.

38:23.040 --> 38:24.871
Now, where is the book?

38:25.640 --> 38:26.993
I don't know.

38:28.280 --> 38:30.589
The bugger died
before I could get it out of him.

38:33.720 --> 38:35.472
<i>How was Gulliver's Travels?</i>

38:36.160 --> 38:39.630
I didn't get too far.
I tried, but it's just too hard.

38:40.680 --> 38:42.591
Hmm. That it is.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.514
<i>Perhaps you'd prefer Treasure Island.</i>

38:47.080 --> 38:50.629
- That sounds good.
- It was a favourite when I was your age.

38:52.880 --> 38:55.519
Why don't you stay and read for a bit.

38:59.720 --> 39:01.756
Congratulations, Murdoch.
The men found the jewels

39:01.840 --> 39:05.435
in a hidden safe at Whittaker's house.
Another case done and dusted.

39:05.520 --> 39:06.669
Hmm.

39:07.240 --> 39:08.309
What now?

39:08.400 --> 39:10.709
Whittaker's in jail, Phillips is dead
and Lawrence will hang for it.

39:11.840 --> 39:15.310
Sir, what about Whittaker's
contact book? The "Bible"?

39:15.560 --> 39:18.438
It's what they were all chasing after.
Each one thinking the other one had it

39:18.520 --> 39:20.988
yet none of them did.

39:23.320 --> 39:24.719
Sorry, Murdoch.

39:26.400 --> 39:28.391
I have a ship to right.

39:30.760 --> 39:32.637
The timing couldn't be better now.

39:32.720 --> 39:35.917
We'll call a press conference
to announce the capture of the thieves

39:36.000 --> 39:38.434
- and the recovery of the jewellery.
- Great.

39:38.520 --> 39:39.555
There you go, lads.

39:39.640 --> 39:41.517
This is exactly
what your campaign needs.

39:41.600 --> 39:43.795
- A photographic opportunity.
- O'Neil.

39:44.800 --> 39:47.439
Tommy Brackenreid, you're a winner.

39:48.400 --> 39:50.038
I am that, Isaac.

39:50.880 --> 39:52.313
I am that.

39:58.200 --> 40:01.033
Phillips knew to
follow Pip to Whittaker's.

40:01.840 --> 40:04.479
'Cause he found out
what Lawrence was planning, right?

40:04.640 --> 40:07.552
But how did Phillips know?

40:08.840 --> 40:11.035
I see Dorrie returned your book.

40:11.920 --> 40:14.798
Don't sound so surprised, William.
He's a good boy.

40:15.720 --> 40:19.235
But how did Phillips know
that Lawrence had hired Pip?

40:23.200 --> 40:24.269
City morgue.

40:24.360 --> 40:25.998
<i>The line to Chicago
is now clear.</i>

40:26.080 --> 40:28.071
<i>I'll put your call through.</i>

40:28.160 --> 40:30.754
How curious.
It's a trunk call from Chicago.

40:33.120 --> 40:34.519
- Chicago?
- Yes.

40:34.680 --> 40:36.989
But I didn't place a call
to Chicago today.

40:37.080 --> 40:39.878
Julia, how long ago was Dorrie here?

40:41.440 --> 40:42.919
Not half an hour ago. Why?

40:44.960 --> 40:46.712
I'll take that call.

40:57.960 --> 41:01.589
I believe you missed your telephone call
from Chicago, young man.

41:01.680 --> 41:02.908
I don't know what you're talking about.

41:03.160 --> 41:05.628
Oh? I think you do.

41:06.560 --> 41:07.879
That's mine!

41:08.680 --> 41:12.673
No. It's Mr Whittaker's,
and I know you killed Pip to get it.

41:16.640 --> 41:19.074
It's a shame that women can never
become police officers.

41:19.160 --> 41:22.596
You'd pass all the tests with ease,
even the physical vigour exam,

41:22.680 --> 41:24.272
which I'm sure
Mr Whittaker will attest to.

41:24.360 --> 41:27.272
Oh, goodness, George,
the life of a policeman is not for me.

41:27.480 --> 41:30.313
- I've something more exciting in mind.
- More exciting than police work?

41:31.400 --> 41:34.517
My own private detective agency.

41:34.600 --> 41:37.034
- A lady detective.
- Why not?

41:38.160 --> 41:41.391
Maybe you'd care to join me.
We make a good team.

41:41.840 --> 41:44.559
- Don't you think?
- Yes, I do.

41:47.640 --> 41:50.712
But I can't let down the Inspector
and Detective Murdoch.

41:52.240 --> 41:53.832
How very true.

41:53.920 --> 41:55.876
Where would they be
without Constable Crabtree?

41:55.960 --> 41:59.077
Oh, I shudder to think, Tess.
I shudder to think.

42:19.880 --> 42:22.758
I can assure you, gentlemen,
and you can quote me,

42:22.880 --> 42:24.518
that when I "right the ship"

42:24.960 --> 42:27.952
there will be no place
for criminals in "Toronto the Good. "

42:33.040 --> 42:36.077
Quite an opportunity
fell into your lap, Dorrie.

42:36.520 --> 42:38.590
You followed Pip to Whittaker's house,

42:38.680 --> 42:40.557
you knew he was
going to steal something,

42:40.640 --> 42:43.234
probably even guessed what that was.

42:43.320 --> 42:46.790
No. I only figured that out
after he showed me the book.

42:49.320 --> 42:50.719
And when you saw the phone numbers

42:50.800 --> 42:53.155
for jewellery buyers
in Chicago and elsewhere,

42:53.960 --> 42:57.236
you realised that Lawrence
was planning to take over the gang.

42:57.320 --> 43:02.030
Yeah, and I think, "Why Lawrence?
Why not me? I'm not stupid. "

43:03.160 --> 43:05.515
No, far from it.

43:06.760 --> 43:08.671
I told Pip I wanted the book.

43:09.040 --> 43:11.554
He wouldn't give it to me,
so I grabbed it.

43:12.880 --> 43:16.190
- Pip fought back.
- He made me bleed, the little toerag.

43:18.040 --> 43:19.712
So I killed him.

43:20.960 --> 43:25.033
Hmm, after all, I just wanted the book.
He should have just given me the book.

43:25.360 --> 43:26.554
Right?

43:36.160 --> 43:38.469
<i>Dorrie moved Pip's body
into the laneway</i>

43:38.560 --> 43:40.915
<i>and then told Phillips
that he had found Pip dead.</i>

43:41.360 --> 43:43.351
Setting up Phillips for Pip's murder.

43:43.680 --> 43:46.274
How could I be so taken in by the boy?

43:47.000 --> 43:48.991
We both were. He used us.

43:50.040 --> 43:53.828
To bring down the jewellery theft ring
and take it over for himself.

43:55.040 --> 43:57.190
He's nothing if not audacious.

43:57.800 --> 44:03.158
I sense it's more than that,
it's as if he imitates normal behaviour

44:04.120 --> 44:07.829
to get what he wants and
has complete disregard for everyone.

44:08.240 --> 44:10.390
<i>But he's just a child.</i>

44:12.400 --> 44:15.870
<i>You didn't see his complete
lack of feeling over killing Pip.</i>

44:16.360 --> 44:19.033
<i>I don't know what
we're dealing with here, Julia.</i>

44:19.160 --> 44:22.436
<i>A mental illness perhaps,
or a good boy gone bad.</i>

44:24.240 --> 44:27.835
<i>Or is it possible to be born
without a conscience?</i>

44:36.760 --> 44:38.113
He's ready.
