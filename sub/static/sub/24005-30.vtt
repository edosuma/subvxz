03:12.067 --> 03:13.443

03:13.443 --> 03:14.861
In the first round
of competition,

03:14.861 --> 03:16.947
you'll have to combine
the mild steel

03:16.947 --> 03:19.449
<i>from a set of these shoes</i>
<i>with the hardenable steel</i>

03:19.449 --> 03:22.369

<i>with a front clip point.</i>

03:24.204 --> 03:26.540

<i>from tip to plunge grind,</i>

03:28.959 --> 03:31.962
<i>and must not exceed 22 inches.</i>

03:31.962 --> 03:33.755
- Having to make
a San Mai blade

03:33.755 --> 03:35.173
out of horseshoes and a rasp

03:35.173 --> 03:36.675
is definitely gonna
be a challenge.

03:36.675 --> 03:38.093
<i>The teeth</i>
<i>on the horseshoe rasp</i>

03:38.093 --> 03:40.512
can cause you air bubbles
and holes,

03:40.512 --> 03:43.098
<i>and the horseshoes themselves</i>
<i>have holes in them.</i>

03:43.098 --> 03:44.683
- Keep in mind
that in the second round

03:44.683 --> 03:46.184
you'll be attaching handles
to those blades

03:46.184 --> 03:47.936
to turn them into
fully-functional weapons

03:47.936 --> 03:50.605
that will be tested
for strength and durability

03:50.605 --> 03:53.525
in a food bucket
stab and chop,

03:53.525 --> 03:57.279
and for edge retention

03:57.279 --> 03:58.864
Good luck, bladesmiths.

03:58.864 --> 04:01.032
Your ten minute

04:03.618 --> 04:07.038
All of our farriers grabbing
four horseshoes each...

04:07.038 --> 04:10.250
- I'm designing a knife
that will stand up to the test.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.919
<i>Kind of a general purpose</i>
<i>camp knife.</i>

04:12.919 --> 04:14.629
I think that'll work.

04:14.629 --> 04:16.423

04:16.423 --> 04:17.924
<i>So what's gonna get me through</i>
<i>the competition today</i>

04:17.924 --> 04:19.301
is gonna be my grandma.

04:19.301 --> 04:20.844
She's no longer with us,
unfortunately,

04:20.844 --> 04:23.638
but she is the reason
I am where I am today,

04:23.638 --> 04:26.183
<i>and I wouldn't be</i>
<i>the woman I am without her.</i>

04:26.183 --> 04:30.479
<i>I decided to build</i>
<i>a camper/whacking knife.</i>

04:30.479 --> 04:33.899
Something that's beefy
and strong.

04:33.899 --> 04:37.360
- Each of those horseshoes
has several holes

04:37.360 --> 04:39.404
that are pre-fabricated
in there.

04:39.404 --> 04:41.448
How do they deal
with those holes?

04:41.448 --> 04:43.366
- Go over with a MIG welder
and just fill them in.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.702
Sand everything flat and clean
that mill scale off of there.

04:45.702 --> 04:48.914
You cut 'em, straighten 'em,
flatten 'em out.

04:48.914 --> 04:50.707
- My plan is
to make something similar

04:50.707 --> 04:52.751
to a Japanese Wakizashi,

04:52.751 --> 04:56.087
<i>which is the short sword</i>
<i>that the samurai carried.</i>

04:56.087 --> 04:58.423
<i>The testing is one reason</i>
<i>I chose the Wakizashi</i>

04:58.423 --> 05:00.425
<i>'cause I feel</i>
<i>that the sword shape</i>

05:00.425 --> 05:05.096
is very versatile
and very durable.

05:05.096 --> 05:07.307
<i>- As I'm designing this,</i>
<i>I'm thinking function</i>

05:07.307 --> 05:08.892
over everything else.

05:08.892 --> 05:10.894
I'm gonna make
a bowie style knife.

05:10.894 --> 05:13.855
<i>It was a very</i>
<i>time-proven design</i>

05:13.855 --> 05:15.690
that I think can make it
through these tests

05:15.690 --> 05:17.275
without a problem.

05:17.275 --> 05:20.028
- Bladesmiths,
this design period is closed.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.364
Your three-hour forge time
starts...

05:22.364 --> 05:24.533
now.

05:24.533 --> 05:26.827
It's the first time
that we've had a competition

05:26.827 --> 05:28.995
where all four
of our bladesmiths

05:28.995 --> 05:32.290
come from a similar
metalworking class.

05:32.290 --> 05:33.875
It'll be interesting to see

05:33.875 --> 05:36.378
how the farrier class'
techniques differ

05:36.378 --> 05:39.172
from the other classes.

05:39.172 --> 05:42.509
- Look at him go, man.
[laughing]

05:42.509 --> 05:44.845
- Long handle,
a relatively light hammer,

05:44.845 --> 05:47.597
and just a lot of...
- A sharp hinge in the hip

05:47.597 --> 05:50.267
every single stroke.
- Whole body.

05:50.267 --> 05:52.936
<i>- Farriers are very good</i>
<i>on the anvil.</i>

05:52.936 --> 05:55.772
We use the anvil
to shape up horses' shoes

05:55.772 --> 05:57.816
that are waiting on us,
and so we don't have

05:57.816 --> 06:00.485
<i>a long time to take this thing</i>
<i>and shape it over the horn</i>

06:00.485 --> 06:02.320
<i>and get it onto that horse.</i>

06:02.320 --> 06:06.074
So we have to be
very efficient and fast.

06:06.074 --> 06:08.869
The rasp by itself
is already pretty much

06:08.869 --> 06:11.204
to the blade requirements
as far as length,

06:11.204 --> 06:12.747
<i>but I'm gonna take two</i>
<i>of the horseshoes</i>

06:12.747 --> 06:14.457
<i>and I'm gonna</i>
<i>straighten them out</i>

06:14.457 --> 06:15.625
<i>so that they can go</i>
<i>straight down the back</i>

06:15.625 --> 06:17.085
<i>of the rasp.</i>

06:17.085 --> 06:18.295
I'm feeling great right now.

06:18.295 --> 06:21.339
I'm hot,
but I'm feeling good.

06:21.339 --> 06:22.841
- I like Kirk's hat.

06:22.841 --> 06:25.594
It reminds me
of a train conductor hat.

06:25.594 --> 06:27.637
Now these horseshoes...
- It's mild steel.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.264
- Mild steel.

06:29.264 --> 06:31.224
