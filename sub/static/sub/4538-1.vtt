00:29.229 --> 00:31.363
Hey Paul... where's
the cookie dough?

00:31.365 --> 00:33.599
Had a freezer malfunction...

00:33.601 --> 00:36.535
Lost a lot of what we had...

00:36.537 --> 00:38.871
Just had the new one
installed yesterday.

00:40.940 --> 00:42.241
Well I think this one's

00:42.243 --> 00:43.542
working a little too well.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.411
Well at least it's working.

00:48.314 --> 00:50.916
Annie's not going to be happy.

00:50.918 --> 00:53.652
So... How is Annie?

00:55.555 --> 00:56.755
She's pregnant.

00:58.391 --> 00:59.625
Congratulations.

01:01.261 --> 01:03.629
You're not exactly jumping
for joy, are you?

01:03.631 --> 01:06.265
I mean it's...

01:06.267 --> 01:08.700
It's not that.

01:08.702 --> 01:11.770
Ha. Look at me. I'm not exactly

01:11.772 --> 01:13.872
fatherhood material.

01:13.874 --> 01:15.240
I don't know the first

01:15.242 --> 01:16.875
thing about raising a kid.

01:16.877 --> 01:21.246
Hell... I felt the same
way about the first one.

01:21.248 --> 01:22.548
It's... um...

01:24.384 --> 01:26.485
It's a big step in a man's life.

01:28.254 --> 01:29.922
You know...

01:29.924 --> 01:31.557
Once upon a time I swore I would

01:31.559 --> 01:32.791
never be like my old man.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.660
Now... here I am...

01:34.662 --> 01:36.762
Giving the same
advice he gave me.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.564
Packet of Smokes... Blues.

01:43.470 --> 01:44.970
Excuse me; Can you
not see we're in

01:44.972 --> 01:46.638
the middle of a
conversation here?

01:46.640 --> 01:48.307
Oh I'm sorry.

01:48.309 --> 01:50.342
I thought this
place was a store.

02:38.325 --> 02:41.894
Steven? Steven Ray?

02:41.896 --> 02:45.697
- Yeah?
- We should meet.

04:14.821 --> 04:16.555
So how did you find me?

04:18.757 --> 04:20.726
Do you believe in fate Steven?

04:22.395 --> 04:23.762
I mean me, myself; I never

04:23.764 --> 04:26.398
really used to think about it.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.066
But I'm coming round to it.

04:31.304 --> 04:34.539
- Right...
- Look the re-the reason I

04:34.541 --> 04:36.575
bring it up is because...

04:36.577 --> 04:39.845
I believe the two of
us were meant to meet.

04:39.847 --> 04:42.781
That this conversation
we are having

04:42.783 --> 04:45.517
right now was meant to happen.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.586
Doesn't matter what
happened yesterday.

04:47.588 --> 04:50.489
We'd still be sitting talking
to each other right now.

04:50.491 --> 04:51.723
What's that? Some sort of

04:51.725 --> 04:53.325
Sigmund Freud shit?

04:53.327 --> 04:56.928
It's Elisabeth Kubler-Ross...
Actually.

04:56.930 --> 04:59.598
I don't know who
the fuck that is.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.433
Is that why you called me here?

05:01.435 --> 05:03.435
Well, did you want
to tell me why you

05:03.437 --> 05:05.637
need someone of my
particular skill set?

05:05.639 --> 05:07.639
Well where do you
want to start?

05:09.208 --> 05:10.475
Say I was to shoot you,

05:10.477 --> 05:11.777
right here, right now?

05:11.779 --> 05:15.447
Right now? No, it wouldn't
work. It's against the rules.

05:15.449 --> 05:17.816
- Rules?
- It has to happen

05:17.818 --> 05:20.218
when I least expect it.

05:20.220 --> 05:21.920
Okay, if I was to shoot you...

05:21.922 --> 05:23.622
Right here and now...

05:23.624 --> 05:25.724
without warning...

05:25.726 --> 05:27.392
Would you expect it?

05:27.394 --> 05:30.629
It's a good point but...
still it wouldn't work.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.297
For it to work...

05:32.299 --> 05:34.299
I need to not want to die.

05:34.301 --> 05:37.669
Right now I want to die.

05:37.671 --> 05:38.904
If I didn't I wouldn't

05:38.906 --> 05:40.472
be here talking to you.

05:48.981 --> 05:50.916
So you've...

05:50.918 --> 05:53.385
paid someone to
shoot you before?

05:53.387 --> 05:54.619
I provoked a situation

05:54.621 --> 05:55.921
that led to it, and...

05:57.490 --> 06:00.292
it obviously ended
with mixed results.

06:00.294 --> 06:05.464
Right. Why don't you
just do it yourself?

06:07.600 --> 06:09.668
What is it about my
face that makes you

06:09.670 --> 06:12.738
think I haven't
already tried that?

06:12.740 --> 06:15.674
Look, I have gone
through an extensive

06:15.676 --> 06:18.443
series of elimination and...

06:18.445 --> 06:20.245
Look I've come up
with this theory.

06:20.247 --> 06:23.615
- A theory?
- Yes.

06:23.617 --> 06:30.489
Really? And your last attempt

06:30.491 --> 06:32.591
that was jumping
off the building?

06:32.593 --> 06:35.360
Uh, sort of.
It wasn't exactly the plan.

06:35.362 --> 06:38.230
Why didn't you think
of that sooner?

06:38.232 --> 06:39.498
I was scared of heights.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.434
Vertigo I think they call it.

06:42.436 --> 06:43.702
Makes me dizzy.

06:51.878 --> 06:54.446
You sure you want to
go through with this?

06:57.016 --> 06:58.750
This is your chance...

06:58.752 --> 07:00.018
If you're not...

07:02.488 --> 07:05.390
people kill themselves
all the time...

07:05.392 --> 07:07.225
usually when they fail...

07:07.227 --> 07:08.894
at suicide it's
because they didn't

07:08.896 --> 07:11.196
actually want to kill
themselves at all.

07:11.198 --> 07:12.330
Usually...

07:13.933 --> 07:15.500
It's for attention.

07:17.970 --> 07:19.671
Desperate cry for help.

07:22.275 --> 07:25.210
This is much more complicated.

07:25.212 --> 07:26.311
Is it?

07:27.914 --> 07:29.848
If you're fucking with me...

07:31.517 --> 07:32.818
playing games...

07:35.254 --> 07:36.755
me killing you...

07:36.757 --> 07:38.657
that's going to
be the last thing

07:38.659 --> 07:40.525
you have to fucking worry about.

07:44.764 --> 07:45.797
Look...

07:45.799 --> 07:47.833
if I tell you, you
have to promise

07:47.835 --> 07:49.468
to not think it's stupid.

07:49.470 --> 07:50.902
I already think it's stupid.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.471
I jumped off the Humber Bridge

07:52.473 --> 07:55.240
in London last year.

07:55.242 --> 07:56.675
Over two hundred people have

07:56.677 --> 07:58.977
successfully committed suicide.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.646
Now I'm one of five to survive.

08:01.648 --> 08:02.814
This...

08:02.816 --> 08:04.883
self-inflicted gun wound...

08:04.885 --> 08:06.785
look... pfff...

08:06.787 --> 08:08.854
You get the picture.

08:08.856 --> 08:10.589
I'm like Cain...

08:10.591 --> 08:12.491
There's something else

08:12.493 --> 08:14.860
happening here that's
out of my control.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.661
You telling me you can't die?

08:16.663 --> 08:18.630
It's a curse.

08:24.871 --> 08:26.371
Pfff.

08:26.373 --> 08:27.572
Is that it?

08:35.847 --> 08:38.350
When exactly am I
supposed to do this?

08:38.352 --> 08:41.919
You have to do it when
I don't want to die.

08:41.922 --> 08:43.421
How the fuck am I supposed

08:43.423 --> 08:44.556
to know when that is?

08:44.558 --> 08:46.958
Look, I'm paying you a
lot of money Steven.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.561
Be creative.

08:57.570 --> 08:59.871
It's a pleasure doing business
with you Mr. Wells.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.339
Percival...

09:01.341 --> 09:03.542
call me Percival.

09:16.622 --> 09:19.424
How are we doing tonight?

09:19.426 --> 09:20.859
Coffee... Black.

09:33.973 --> 09:37.642
- What?
- Independent jobs I see.

09:37.644 --> 09:39.010
Freelancing again.

09:46.218 --> 09:48.386
I needed the money.

09:48.388 --> 09:49.721
You get my consent first

09:49.723 --> 09:52.557
before you do anything Steven.

09:52.559 --> 09:53.825
Anything!

09:55.962 --> 09:57.429
It's easy money.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.500
It's not like I'm making any

10:02.502 --> 10:04.269
fucking money working for you.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.671
We're not exactly working
for free Steven.

10:10.977 --> 10:12.344
Frank Dubios.

10:14.680 --> 10:16.915
Is he dead or not?

10:16.917 --> 10:18.083
Something happened.

10:21.554 --> 10:23.054
There was an incident.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.694
That'll be $12.95 sir.

10:29.696 --> 10:31.363
Across the street.

10:31.365 --> 10:32.764
Mind getting out here?

10:32.766 --> 10:36.301
Yeah I do fucking mind if I get
out here. Across the street.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.436
Yeah, you can walk
across the street.

10:38.438 --> 10:40.438
No, across the street.

10:40.440 --> 10:41.706
Far left corner.

10:41.708 --> 10:44.309
Look... just pay me and get out.

10:44.311 --> 10:45.410
- You free?

10:45.412 --> 10:48.013
Yeah I just need him to pay.
Alright?

10:48.015 --> 10:49.547
I'll pay you when you take

10:49.549 --> 10:50.782
me across the street.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.664
Sir, you're being
very difficult.

11:07.533 --> 11:08.633
Fuck!

12:00.252 --> 12:01.553
Fainted?

12:01.555 --> 12:04.222
It's a seizure.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.523
Still struggling with the

12:05.525 --> 12:07.058
street crossing thing I see.

12:08.861 --> 12:10.795
And as for our old pal?

12:10.797 --> 12:12.464
Frank?

12:12.466 --> 12:14.365
Well that's to be continued.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.751
You're awake.

13:06.753 --> 13:08.052
How do you feel?

13:09.989 --> 13:12.590
You were shot three times.

13:12.592 --> 13:14.592
On the train.

13:14.594 --> 13:15.827
You remember?

13:18.531 --> 13:20.265
Turns out being shot could have

13:20.267 --> 13:21.866
been a blessing in disguise.

13:21.868 --> 13:23.868
While we were removing
one of the bullets,

13:23.870 --> 13:25.637
We found a golf-ball
sized tumor...

13:25.639 --> 13:28.373
dangerously close to
your spinal column.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.741
We were able to remove the

13:29.743 --> 13:31.509
tumor without complications.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.578
Now it wasn't cancerous...

13:33.580 --> 13:35.680
But if it had grown
much larger...

13:35.682 --> 13:37.949
you could have ended up
spending the rest of your life

13:37.951 --> 13:40.351
in a wheelchair.
Or even be dead.

13:41.687 --> 13:44.889
Everything else appears
to be tip top.

13:44.891 --> 13:47.759
None of your wounds
is life threatening.

13:47.761 --> 13:49.360
No significant damage to any

13:49.362 --> 13:52.030
internal organs,
no artery damage.

13:52.032 --> 13:53.631
We were only able to remove

13:53.633 --> 13:55.600
one of the bullets though.

13:55.602 --> 13:57.535
So you might have
a bit of trouble

13:57.537 --> 13:59.437
getting through
airport security.

14:02.241 --> 14:03.575
Three bullets.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.946
You're very lucky to be alive.

14:30.970 --> 14:32.971
Although I appreciate
the effort...

14:32.973 --> 14:34.939
I did tell you the conditions.

14:34.941 --> 14:36.841
You still don't believe me?

14:39.612 --> 14:42.380
I'll give you credit
where credits due.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.882
Certainly an ambitious little

14:43.884 --> 14:46.618
theory you got going but...

14:46.620 --> 14:48.519
It's still ridiculous.

14:48.521 --> 14:50.355
It's not possible.

14:50.357 --> 14:53.358
You saw me land on
your cab. Right?

14:53.360 --> 14:54.792
Remember those three bullets

14:54.794 --> 14:56.361
you put in my chest?

14:56.363 --> 14:57.829
People fall of buildings.

14:57.831 --> 14:59.797
People get shot, I
have heard of more

14:59.799 --> 15:01.799
fantastic tales of
survival than that.

15:01.801 --> 15:03.668
It's a curse. I know it is.

15:05.471 --> 15:06.905
Okay...

15:06.907 --> 15:09.007
Let's say for a moment
that it is a curse.

15:09.009 --> 15:10.675
- It is.
- It's not...

15:10.677 --> 15:12.557
but let's fucking say
that it is.

15:13.879 --> 15:15.513
How do we break it?

15:17.549 --> 15:18.883
I don't know.

15:18.885 --> 15:20.518
Oh Come on...

15:22.554 --> 15:24.255
Come on it's clear you've got

15:24.257 --> 15:26.591
a very vivid imagination.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.927
You seem to know everything
about everything else.

15:28.929 --> 15:32.263
But you got nothing for that?

15:32.265 --> 15:33.965
Tell me what do I have to do?

15:36.001 --> 15:38.603
Okay, a werewolf...

15:38.605 --> 15:41.472
A werewolf will die
with a silver bullet.

15:41.474 --> 15:45.009
Vampire's weakness... garlic!
Superman... Kryptoni-

15:45.011 --> 15:46.544
It's not a comic book.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.446
Look, I'm just trying
to level with you here.

15:48.448 --> 15:52.016
No, I'm trying to understand
where the fuck it is that

15:52.018 --> 15:54.585
you're coming from.
Because from my point of view,

15:54.587 --> 15:55.553
your point of view is a
little fucking Norma Desmond.

15:55.555 --> 15:58.356
I know it's crazy but...

15:58.358 --> 16:00.024
Look there's... there's no
other explanation for it.

16:00.026 --> 16:03.294
There doesn't need to be an
explanation, shit happens,

16:03.296 --> 16:05.563
Get that through
your fucking head.

16:05.565 --> 16:08.366
There's no such thing as
fate, there's no such thing

16:08.368 --> 16:09.567
as Karma. There's certainly
no fucking such thing...

16:09.569 --> 16:11.903
as a curse.

16:11.905 --> 16:14.505
Look I don't know how
else to prove it to you.

16:14.507 --> 16:17.408
I thought everything that
happened would speak for itself.

16:17.410 --> 16:18.543
Enough!

16:18.545 --> 16:20.278
Enough playtime.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.379
Okay?

16:22.915 --> 16:25.683
We're both adults here.

16:25.685 --> 16:28.519
The fact of the matter
is that I fucked up.

16:28.521 --> 16:30.521
We were on a public
train and I rushed it.

16:30.523 --> 16:33.291
I wasn't precise with my shots.
I'm usually more thorough.

16:33.293 --> 16:35.893
And how many times have
you done this before?

16:39.732 --> 16:41.399
So ah...

16:41.401 --> 16:43.534
for this to work...

16:43.536 --> 16:45.803
you need to be happy
when I do it?

16:45.805 --> 16:49.974
Not quite I need to be in...
um... an overall state of mind.

16:49.976 --> 16:53.878
Where I truly and
honestly want to live.

16:53.880 --> 16:56.414
But you said you
don't want to live.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.883
You don't want to live, right?

16:58.885 --> 17:01.786
That's a problem. Well that
makes it next to impossible.

17:01.788 --> 17:03.821
I didn't say it was
going to be easy.

17:03.823 --> 17:06.324
That's why I paid you
as much as I did.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.928
Look...

17:10.930 --> 17:12.696
try and get to know me.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.632
Figure out what makes me tick.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.768
My likes, Dislikes...

17:16.770 --> 17:19.837
Try and figure out something
I do take joy out of.

17:19.839 --> 17:22.373
This isn't the fucking
make a wish foundation.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.541
I kill people.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.411
You asked for a suggestion.

17:28.714 --> 17:31.449
You're no different to any
of the others you know.

17:31.451 --> 17:34.018
Bullet through your fucking
brain does exactly the

17:34.020 --> 17:37.989
same thing to you as it
does to everybody else.

17:37.991 --> 17:39.590
Let's just hope so.

17:48.667 --> 17:50.601
I'll see you when I see you.

21:10.669 --> 21:12.069
So how do you feel?

21:15.841 --> 21:17.642
You're lucky to be alive.

21:45.671 --> 21:46.837
Where to?

21:49.341 --> 21:50.441
There.

21:53.412 --> 21:54.879
It's across the road.

22:03.922 --> 22:06.357
So what's with this place.

22:06.359 --> 22:08.659
Couldn't you pick
some place quiet?

22:08.661 --> 22:11.762
Look I've been in isolation for
the better part of a month.

22:11.764 --> 22:14.031
Eating nothing but
hospital food and...

22:14.033 --> 22:15.800
watching daytime television,

22:15.802 --> 22:18.536
excuse me for wanting to
get out of the house.

22:20.906 --> 22:22.973
Does it hurt?

22:22.975 --> 22:26.344
What, this hole in my face
where my eyeball used to be?

22:27.846 --> 22:30.448
You know every time you
try and kill yourself?

22:30.450 --> 22:33.284
You don't want to know.

22:33.286 --> 22:34.952
If you hadn't turned
around I would have

22:34.954 --> 22:36.787
got you right in the
back of the head.

22:36.789 --> 22:39.824
You bagged and tagged in the
morgue right now probably.

22:39.826 --> 22:41.292
Oh probably...

22:41.294 --> 22:43.828
Someone's starting to believe.

22:43.830 --> 22:47.631
Hell of a coincidence, I'll give
you that. It's no coincidence.

22:47.633 --> 22:49.834
All this has happened
for a reason.

22:52.037 --> 22:54.538
Maybe I'm just not
the guy for the job.

22:56.007 --> 22:57.475
I don't know.

22:57.477 --> 22:59.977
I haven't been myself lately.

22:59.979 --> 23:02.513
Out of all the hundreds
of cabs in this town...

23:02.515 --> 23:04.849
I landed on yours.

23:04.851 --> 23:06.650
You'll get the job done.

23:11.590 --> 23:13.824
Thanks.

23:13.826 --> 23:14.892
Ice-cream.

23:16.995 --> 23:19.397
Yeah, why? What's
wrong with ice-cream?

23:21.600 --> 23:23.100
I got a sweet tooth.

23:26.972 --> 23:28.406
Mmm good.

23:31.710 --> 23:33.811
So tell me.

23:33.813 --> 23:35.880
Why do you want to kill
yourself so badly?

23:35.882 --> 23:38.349
Mummy and Daddy, they
didn't love you enough?

23:38.351 --> 23:41.619
No it had nothing to do
with anything like that.

23:41.621 --> 23:44.455
It has everything to do
with anything like that.

23:46.324 --> 23:48.626
How do you expect me to
help you if you don't

23:48.628 --> 23:51.796
give me all the
necessary information?

23:53.299 --> 23:54.999
I mean...

23:55.001 --> 23:58.636
you told me I had to kill you
when you least expected it.

23:58.638 --> 24:00.905
Tried that, didn't work.
Obviously.

24:02.707 --> 24:04.542
Let's get creative here.

24:07.279 --> 24:09.513
No I don't want to
think about it.

24:11.483 --> 24:14.452
When was the last
time you were happy?

24:14.454 --> 24:16.887
- Happy?
- Yeah.

24:16.889 --> 24:19.423
You know the most recent
point in time where...

24:19.425 --> 24:21.492
You didn't feel like
a suicidal maniac.

24:24.663 --> 24:27.364
I don't want to think about
it, it gets me depressed.

24:27.366 --> 24:29.834
It's a little late for
that don't you think?

24:33.738 --> 24:34.805
Lovelorn?

24:40.612 --> 24:43.280
I'm getting warm huh?

24:43.282 --> 24:44.348
That's it.

24:44.350 --> 24:46.750
Lost loved one?

24:46.752 --> 24:48.786
Well done Steven.

24:48.788 --> 24:50.521
What, were you a psychiatrist

24:50.523 --> 24:53.757
before you went into the
business of killing people?

24:53.759 --> 24:55.893
You should have you
own... talk show.

24:58.730 --> 25:00.965
I don't have the
personality for it.

25:03.368 --> 25:06.036
Good, you've done your homework.

25:06.038 --> 25:08.639
At least my money's
not going to waste.

25:11.376 --> 25:12.877
What was her name?

25:15.981 --> 25:18.415
Come on, what was her name?

25:18.417 --> 25:19.483
Chris.

25:21.319 --> 25:23.454
It's a nice name.

25:23.456 --> 25:24.989
I like that name.

25:24.991 --> 25:26.090
Sounds hot.

25:27.626 --> 25:29.760
What was she like?

25:29.762 --> 25:32.363
Oh! Give me something,
what did she look like?

25:32.365 --> 25:35.566
Humph! Ah... 6 foot...

25:35.568 --> 25:37.334
Dimples...

25:37.336 --> 25:38.936
and a HUGE cock.

25:40.739 --> 25:42.306
Did you say a huge cock?

25:42.308 --> 25:43.908
Yeah.

25:43.910 --> 25:45.376
Oh it was a she-male?

25:45.378 --> 25:47.411
Hah No, not a she-male.

25:47.413 --> 25:48.579
He was a man.

25:50.682 --> 25:52.483
You're a fag?

25:52.485 --> 25:54.318
I'm gay.

25:54.320 --> 25:55.986
And...

25:55.988 --> 25:57.555
you fuck guys.

26:00.458 --> 26:02.026
Jesus!

26:03.795 --> 26:06.897
I mean you know it's ah...

26:06.899 --> 26:08.866
It's... yeah... good for you.

26:11.469 --> 26:13.337
As long as you think...

26:13.339 --> 26:14.572
It's alright...

26:14.574 --> 26:17.274
and you're happy...
and the other person's...

26:17.276 --> 26:19.376
Look maybe I'll stop you there.

26:19.378 --> 26:20.711
Okay.

26:20.713 --> 26:22.012
So, what happened?

26:24.382 --> 26:26.951
You want me to kill you or not,
what happened?

26:35.927 --> 26:38.262
He was murdered.

26:38.264 --> 26:39.763
You did it?

26:39.765 --> 26:41.732
No, uh... I'm not like you.

26:41.734 --> 26:42.833
No...

26:42.835 --> 26:44.501
You're not like me.

26:44.503 --> 26:47.004
Certainly not like me.

26:47.006 --> 26:48.038
That's it.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.373
I got it.

26:50.976 --> 26:52.643
- I've got an idea.
- Ooh!

26:52.645 --> 26:54.511
An idea.

26:54.513 --> 26:55.913
Come on, don't
keep me waiting...

26:55.915 --> 26:57.348
I'm on the edge of my seat.

26:57.350 --> 26:59.416
Okay, but before I say anything.

26:59.418 --> 27:01.418
I just want to remind
you that I think

27:01.420 --> 27:03.354
all this is a crock
of shit. Clear?

27:03.356 --> 27:04.455
Crystal.

27:04.457 --> 27:05.823
Good.

27:05.825 --> 27:08.826
You ever thought
about dating again?

27:08.828 --> 27:10.861
Well I am human...

27:10.863 --> 27:13.697
I do appreciate companionship.

27:13.699 --> 27:15.866
But... dating...

27:15.868 --> 27:19.403
It just takes so long to
build up a relationship.

27:19.405 --> 27:21.372
Quite frankly I don't want
to live that long.

27:21.374 --> 27:23.340
I'm not talking about a
fucking relationship.

27:23.342 --> 27:24.642
It's not like "dating" dating.

27:24.644 --> 27:27.611
I'm talking about fucking.

27:27.613 --> 27:29.647
Steven, look at me.

27:29.649 --> 27:32.016
I look like a pirate.
Who wants to...

27:32.018 --> 27:35.519
do anything with me sexually.

27:35.521 --> 27:38.555
This is the valley.
I'm sure there is...

27:38.557 --> 27:40.391
fags like you everywhere.

27:40.393 --> 27:43.527
Maybe even in this bar.

27:43.529 --> 27:45.496
- Hah.
- What?

27:47.832 --> 27:49.099
What did I say?

28:04.516 --> 28:08.519
What can I get you?
I'll get a draft please.

28:08.521 --> 28:10.387
And whatever he wants.

28:12.323 --> 28:14.324
Dirty martini.

28:14.326 --> 28:15.626
Extra dirty.

28:17.595 --> 28:18.929
Thanks for the drink.

28:18.931 --> 28:20.898
Don't mention it.

28:20.900 --> 28:22.366
What's your name?

28:22.368 --> 28:26.937
- Kim.
- Kim...

28:26.939 --> 28:30.607
I've got this friend who is
really dying to meet you.

28:30.609 --> 28:33.277
Really? Where is he?

28:33.279 --> 28:35.479
He's a great guy.

28:35.481 --> 28:37.347
He's a little bit bashful.

28:39.951 --> 28:41.452
Name's Percival.

28:42.921 --> 28:44.788
Yeah, not really my type.

28:46.458 --> 28:48.459
But you're gay?

28:48.461 --> 28:50.494
Yeah, so?

28:50.496 --> 28:52.062
You've got a cock?

28:52.064 --> 28:53.430
Excuse me?

28:54.766 --> 28:55.999
You've got a cock.

28:56.001 --> 28:58.469
What else do you need?

28:58.471 --> 28:59.536
Look...

29:01.372 --> 29:03.040
He really needs to get laid.

29:03.042 --> 29:05.442
Are you fucking kidding me?

29:05.444 --> 29:07.044
I know he's not much to look at.

29:07.046 --> 29:08.746
Who the hell do you
think you are?

29:08.748 --> 29:10.748
I'll pay you.

29:10.750 --> 29:12.449
You're sick in the head.

29:12.451 --> 29:13.617
$300

29:13.619 --> 29:15.486
$500 if you seal the deal.

29:37.041 --> 29:38.709
Oh my God.

30:16.748 --> 30:19.983
I paid you to kill me,
not innocent people.

30:19.985 --> 30:21.785
I don't leave witnesses.

30:24.556 --> 30:25.722
Where is he?

30:27.859 --> 30:30.060
I buried him.

30:30.062 --> 30:31.395
Hah.

30:32.897 --> 30:34.598
He was a good person.

30:37.368 --> 30:40.671
You didn't even fucking know
him. He didn't deserve to die.

30:42.807 --> 30:44.575
What am I supposed to do?

30:44.577 --> 30:46.743
I'm a professional,
no loose ends.

30:52.417 --> 30:54.785
You shot him point
blank in the face.

30:54.787 --> 30:56.987
All you did to me was
smother me with a pillow.

30:56.989 --> 30:59.756
Yeah well I felt bad about
taking your eye out.

30:59.758 --> 31:01.058
Okay?

31:01.060 --> 31:03.794
Didn't want to disfigure you
more than I already have.

31:08.499 --> 31:10.434
He's a good man.

31:10.436 --> 31:13.403
Saw past my face
and he liked me...

31:13.405 --> 31:16.073
for who I was. Made me
feel like I was somebody.

31:16.075 --> 31:18.542
Yeah well, that's what
he was paid to do.

31:18.544 --> 31:19.643
Excuse me?

31:22.347 --> 31:24.147
I paid him to have sex with you.

31:29.554 --> 31:34.925
- Oh, come on.

31:34.927 --> 31:36.627
Really, you going to cry?

31:37.996 --> 31:40.397
Well I'm going home,
call me when you're done.

31:40.399 --> 31:42.633
This isn't a fucking
game Steven.

33:03.982 --> 33:06.717
My name's Steven.

33:06.719 --> 33:08.618
Nice to meet you Steven.

33:12.724 --> 33:15.492
Not going to tell me your name?

33:15.494 --> 33:16.760
You didn't ask.

33:18.696 --> 33:19.896
It's Jessica.

33:24.602 --> 33:26.470
I see you round here a bit.

33:28.773 --> 33:29.973
Always alone.

33:37.515 --> 33:38.982
So what do you do?

33:40.952 --> 33:42.486
I kill people.

33:46.758 --> 33:48.925
Hah, is there much
money in that?

33:51.796 --> 33:53.964
You any good at your job?

33:53.966 --> 33:55.032
Not lately.

34:02.407 --> 34:04.474
Haven't been laid in a while.

34:08.813 --> 34:10.647
Promise to be good at it?

34:29.000 --> 34:30.833
Wow... ah... I do have to ask...

34:30.835 --> 34:33.402
About the um... eye-patch.

34:33.405 --> 34:34.704
What about it?

34:34.706 --> 34:37.574
Is it for fashion or...

34:37.576 --> 34:39.708
It was an accident.

34:39.710 --> 34:41.110
Oh what happened?

34:42.780 --> 34:45.681
I tripped, fell and lost an eye.

34:45.684 --> 34:47.050
Shit!

34:47.052 --> 34:49.753
Must have been one nasty spill.

34:49.755 --> 34:51.455
Yeah. I suppose it was.

34:57.295 --> 34:59.396
I'm sorry I don't mean to stare.

35:00.865 --> 35:03.667
Sorry, it's just um... that
I'm still getting used to it.

35:03.669 --> 35:06.703
I never really saw myself
as an eye-patch kind of a guy.

35:08.407 --> 35:10.707
That's fine, you...
you look good.

35:14.579 --> 35:16.580
This one, sir...

35:16.582 --> 35:18.482
is on me.

35:18.484 --> 35:20.584
Thanks.

35:20.586 --> 35:22.085
It's Brad, right?

35:22.087 --> 35:23.587
Yeah.

35:23.589 --> 35:25.422
You... you from around here?

35:31.729 --> 35:32.996
Come on.

35:32.998 --> 35:35.966
Fuck me. Fuck me harder.

35:35.968 --> 35:37.100
Come on.

35:47.778 --> 35:48.945
Stop.

35:48.947 --> 35:50.013
You stop.

35:52.316 --> 35:53.717
Stop.

35:53.719 --> 35:55.352
Oh. Oh!

36:01.692 --> 36:04.594
Stop. Please... Stop.

36:04.596 --> 36:06.062
What the fuck?

36:06.064 --> 36:08.732
Get the fuck off me!

36:08.734 --> 36:09.866
What did I do?

36:09.868 --> 36:11.668
You tried to fucking
strangle me.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.637
- What?
- Fucker!

36:15.039 --> 36:16.706
I'm sorry.

36:16.708 --> 36:19.643
What the fuck is...

36:19.645 --> 36:21.411
Fuck off!

36:21.413 --> 36:22.779
I'm sorry.

36:22.781 --> 36:24.548
I thought you enjoyed it!

36:24.550 --> 36:25.749
HEY!

36:37.762 --> 36:40.797
I want you to take off your
pants and close your eyes.

36:53.511 --> 36:54.811
Brad?

36:54.813 --> 36:56.413
What are you doing?

36:58.616 --> 37:00.584
What the fuck do you think...

37:10.294 --> 37:13.630
You think this kind of
lifestyle is appropriate?

37:13.632 --> 37:15.932
You faggots, you
fucking make me sick.

37:27.478 --> 37:29.346
You may know who we are...

37:29.348 --> 37:31.715
we know who you are.

37:34.720 --> 37:38.722
And if you even think about
getting the law involved, mate.

37:38.724 --> 37:40.957
You'll be begging
for us to kill you.

37:44.629 --> 37:47.664
This is what happens when you
go around sucking dicks, mate.

37:47.666 --> 37:49.466
Think of it as...

37:52.470 --> 37:55.705
What's that? Wait, the
queer's got something to say.

37:55.707 --> 37:58.074
Come on, speak up
so we can all hear.

37:58.076 --> 38:00.010
All you faggots...

38:00.012 --> 38:03.013
can suck my dick.

38:53.932 --> 38:55.031
Hello?

38:55.033 --> 38:57.967
I've locked myself out.

38:57.969 --> 38:59.969
Could you open up
for me please?

39:01.672 --> 39:03.506
Who... who is it?

39:03.508 --> 39:05.975
Apartment 10 Frank Dubois.

39:37.541 --> 39:39.109
INSIDE APARTMENT (MALE Hello?

39:40.745 --> 39:41.945
Who is it?

39:47.418 --> 39:49.919
Do you have any idea
what time it is?

39:49.921 --> 39:51.654
INSIDE APARTMENT Daddy?

40:18.682 --> 40:19.849
You hear that?

40:21.752 --> 40:23.553
I can hear you thinking.

40:28.092 --> 40:29.826
Something's the matter.

40:33.431 --> 40:34.964
I can't do this anymore.

40:37.802 --> 40:40.403
Do what?

40:40.405 --> 40:41.871
You fucking know what.

40:43.707 --> 40:45.809
You been killing people
your whole life, kid...

40:45.811 --> 40:47.777
and all of a sudden you can't?

40:49.647 --> 40:51.648
Why is Frank Dubois
still alive?

40:58.889 --> 41:00.089
Something's...

41:02.726 --> 41:04.994
Something's happening
to me, mate.

41:07.097 --> 41:09.599
I feel...

41:09.601 --> 41:10.900
I feel different.

41:12.937 --> 41:14.904
No my boy...

41:14.906 --> 41:17.941
I can see right through you.

41:17.943 --> 41:21.344
I know you better than
you know yourself.

41:21.346 --> 41:24.380
Lying to me is
counterproductive.

41:24.382 --> 41:26.015
You don't feel anything.

41:28.919 --> 41:30.353
This is different.

41:30.355 --> 41:32.422
No it's not.

41:32.424 --> 41:33.723
It's different.

41:36.093 --> 41:38.862
I can feel things I haven't
felt in a long time.

41:40.397 --> 41:41.564
Like what?

41:44.435 --> 41:46.603
I don't think I can
do this anymore.

41:50.107 --> 41:52.475
Kill the queer...

41:52.477 --> 41:53.743
and move on.

42:02.853 --> 42:04.687
Why do you hurt people?

42:08.425 --> 42:09.526
I don't know.

42:16.401 --> 42:18.401
You just...

42:18.403 --> 42:20.169
You do it for the sake of it?

42:24.842 --> 42:27.510
I'll never understand it.

42:30.381 --> 42:32.682
Why people can do such...

42:32.684 --> 42:34.617
ugly things to one another.

42:37.755 --> 42:39.489
Why is there so much...

42:39.491 --> 42:41.157
hate and anger in the world?

42:46.463 --> 42:47.997
You remember being born?

42:50.034 --> 42:52.035
First words?

42:52.037 --> 42:53.870
First steps?

42:53.872 --> 42:56.573
Of course not, nobody does.

42:56.575 --> 42:58.808
My earliest memory.

42:58.810 --> 43:00.176
Is of my father.

43:03.847 --> 43:06.683
Throwing me head first through
a plate glass coffee table.

43:10.020 --> 43:11.688
Fifty stitches.

43:17.928 --> 43:19.362
Closest thing to affection

43:19.364 --> 43:20.997
anybody had ever shown me.

43:23.801 --> 43:25.368
Till Annie...

43:25.370 --> 43:26.469
came along.

43:27.871 --> 43:29.005
Your wife?

43:34.078 --> 43:35.445
Where is she?

43:44.121 --> 43:45.855
Is that why you do it?

43:48.492 --> 43:50.893
Goes back to that.

43:50.895 --> 43:52.729
That first memory, you know.

43:54.832 --> 43:57.433
It wasn't what...

43:57.435 --> 44:00.570
It wasn't what happened.

44:00.572 --> 44:02.805
It's what I was
thinking at the time.

44:04.975 --> 44:08.611
I envisioned myself
picking up...

44:08.613 --> 44:11.014
One of those pieces of glass.

44:12.883 --> 44:15.051
And slicing his throat with it.

44:17.054 --> 44:19.455
Watching him bleed to death.

44:24.094 --> 44:26.896
Couldn't have been more than...

44:26.898 --> 44:29.432
Four, five years
old at the time.

44:31.902 --> 44:34.604
And that's what was
running through my head.

44:36.407 --> 44:38.908
This is the kind of thoughts...

44:38.910 --> 44:40.543
kids just have.

44:42.913 --> 44:44.180
Not like that.

44:46.984 --> 44:48.818
So where did it all start.

44:50.354 --> 44:53.389
I don't know, I can't
remember being born.

44:53.391 --> 44:55.391
Can't remember my first...

44:55.393 --> 44:56.826
words, first steps.

45:00.631 --> 45:02.832
I can't remember
when all this...

45:05.369 --> 45:06.636
began but...

45:09.873 --> 45:11.841
it's like it was always there.

45:16.880 --> 45:19.749
I'm no better than the
guys that did this to you.

45:27.491 --> 45:28.624
Five on one.

45:30.594 --> 45:32.395
Just doesn't seem fair.

45:44.108 --> 45:45.875
You from around here?

45:47.578 --> 45:49.746
Just visiting.

45:49.748 --> 45:51.714
Oh yeah, vacation?

45:51.716 --> 45:52.782
Business trip.

45:52.784 --> 45:56.352
Business trip.
Oh yeah, what do you do?

45:56.354 --> 45:57.787
I'm a salesman.

45:57.789 --> 45:58.921
Life insurance.

45:58.923 --> 46:00.022
Ah Yeah.

46:01.658 --> 46:04.494
You in town for long?

46:04.496 --> 46:05.928
No, I leave in the morning.

46:05.930 --> 46:07.530
Oh that's too bad.

46:07.532 --> 46:09.999
Hm... staying at the Grand Royal.

46:10.001 --> 46:11.534
That's a good hotel.

46:11.536 --> 46:12.735
Yeah.

46:14.438 --> 46:16.506
Ah, business must be good then.

46:17.808 --> 46:19.008
So so.

46:19.010 --> 46:20.843
Been a bit slow lately.

46:20.845 --> 46:22.645
Ah, that's a bummer.

46:22.647 --> 46:24.781
I have a feeling
it's going to...

46:24.783 --> 46:26.182
pick up real soon.

46:33.757 --> 46:35.158
This one's on me.

46:37.694 --> 46:39.529
What time you get off?

46:46.770 --> 46:49.739
You want to turn the light on?

46:49.741 --> 46:50.940
I like the dark.

46:54.711 --> 46:56.546
What's with all the newspaper?

46:56.548 --> 46:58.815
You got a dog or something?

47:01.118 --> 47:03.319
Whoa! What are you doing?

47:08.059 --> 47:12.361
Shut your fucking mouth or
your head is next. Okay?

47:16.067 --> 47:17.166
Fuck!

47:19.403 --> 47:24.006
Shit! Fuck!

47:26.010 --> 47:28.010
I want you to call...

47:28.012 --> 47:30.012
The three gentlemen
you had come round

47:30.014 --> 47:31.981
and rough up my friend
the other night.

47:31.983 --> 47:34.851
I don't - I don't know
what you're talking about.

47:34.853 --> 47:37.587
You don't fucking know
what I'm talking about?

47:39.523 --> 47:40.656
Holy shit.

47:40.658 --> 47:42.625
I'll give you ten seconds, Brad.

47:42.627 --> 47:44.827
Before I call every
single contact...

47:44.829 --> 47:46.829
in your phone...
and I kill them.

47:49.433 --> 47:51.467
Ten seconds, Brad. Call them.

47:51.469 --> 47:54.103
I did, they - they're
on their way.

47:56.440 --> 47:57.473
Oh shit.

47:57.475 --> 47:59.175
So that's how it works huh?

48:03.080 --> 48:06.015
- How long till they get here?
- I don't -

48:07.919 --> 48:09.485
Speak of the devil.

48:12.590 --> 48:15.658
- What are you doing on the
floor? - That's not right.

48:16.794 --> 48:19.795
Whur! Huur!

48:19.797 --> 48:22.331
Oh fuck.

48:22.333 --> 48:23.566
Please... please...

48:26.336 --> 48:28.504
Pull your pants down.

48:28.506 --> 48:30.106
What?

48:30.108 --> 48:32.008
Don't fucking make
me ask you twice.

48:32.010 --> 48:33.576
Okay.

48:40.417 --> 48:41.584
Everything!

48:43.520 --> 48:44.987
Please...

48:44.989 --> 48:47.456
Don't make me do this.

48:47.458 --> 48:48.958
I'm not making you do anything.

48:48.960 --> 48:50.159
What?

48:55.466 --> 48:56.999
Fuck!

48:57.001 --> 48:58.901
No!

48:58.903 --> 49:00.603
Oh fuck!

49:00.605 --> 49:01.737
OH FUCK!

49:01.739 --> 49:03.105
Come on, it's not that bad.

49:03.107 --> 49:05.041
Shit!

49:05.043 --> 49:07.443
Look at that.
I think I missed a spot.

49:08.613 --> 49:09.679
SHIT!

49:11.648 --> 49:12.949
OH FUCK!

49:12.951 --> 49:14.016
Oh fuck.

49:20.358 --> 49:21.557
Oh fuck.

49:21.559 --> 49:22.792
Oh fuck.

49:22.794 --> 49:25.628
Why is it that you hate
gays so much? Huh?

49:27.097 --> 49:28.664
You a religious man?

49:28.666 --> 49:29.832
Brad?

49:29.834 --> 49:31.767
Fanatic?

49:31.769 --> 49:33.736
Get a little too
much attention?

49:33.738 --> 49:35.438
From your uncle?

49:36.807 --> 49:40.109
Maybe it's just
me... I don't know.

49:40.111 --> 49:42.812
Maybe I'm just incapable
of understanding.

49:44.514 --> 49:46.115
You see, I don't give a fuck...

49:46.117 --> 49:48.918
If you're gay, straight,
black, white...

49:48.920 --> 49:51.787
Fucking purple...
I kill everybody.

49:51.789 --> 49:53.723
Please!

49:53.725 --> 49:56.092
Please just fucking kill me!

50:03.734 --> 50:05.167
No, it's too easy.

50:07.604 --> 50:10.473
I'm going to give you some time
to think about this Brad.

50:12.876 --> 50:15.911
In case you get any bright
ideas. About retribution...

50:15.913 --> 50:19.915
or speaking to someone about
what's gone on here tonight.

50:19.917 --> 50:22.551
I will come back to
finish what I started.

50:27.858 --> 50:29.091
Cheer up Brad.

50:29.093 --> 50:31.127
It's a good day for you.

50:31.129 --> 50:32.962
You're lucky to be alive.

50:51.782 --> 50:53.049
Fuck.

51:04.128 --> 51:05.561
Just kidding.

51:11.501 --> 51:13.202
So... ah, this is your place?

51:27.851 --> 51:29.785
You did all these?

51:29.787 --> 51:30.986
I did.

51:34.624 --> 51:36.092
So that's what you do?

51:37.894 --> 51:39.829
You're like an artist?

51:39.831 --> 51:41.063
I try to be.

51:44.468 --> 51:47.570
Make money from these?

51:47.572 --> 51:49.538
Here and there.

51:49.540 --> 51:52.007
I have my work in galleries
sometimes and if

51:52.009 --> 51:54.610
someone likes them,
maybe they'll buy them.

52:01.751 --> 52:03.919
Something new?

52:03.921 --> 52:05.621
Work in progress.

52:07.124 --> 52:09.358
That's a face.

52:09.360 --> 52:12.094
Thanks, that's what
it's supposed to be.

52:14.364 --> 52:15.865
You got a name for it?

52:17.567 --> 52:19.969
Christopher.

52:19.971 --> 52:21.203
Right.

52:23.540 --> 52:24.807
Ahem.

52:34.551 --> 52:36.952
Don't worry.
I didn't kill everybody.

52:41.791 --> 52:43.959
What did you do to them?

52:43.961 --> 52:45.794
Let's just say...

52:45.796 --> 52:47.196
He's a changed man.

52:50.700 --> 52:51.934
What?

52:58.775 --> 53:00.009
You gave me his address.

53:00.011 --> 53:01.043
Yeah, so?

53:01.045 --> 53:02.745
So!

53:02.747 --> 53:06.515
What did you think was
going to happen?

53:06.517 --> 53:08.150
Hah.

53:08.152 --> 53:10.786
Tell me something. Be honest.

53:10.788 --> 53:13.856
Somewhere deep down
in your mind...

53:13.858 --> 53:15.991
You wanted me to
kill him, right?

53:18.094 --> 53:19.161
Didn't you?

53:26.970 --> 53:29.805
You want to crack a window
or something, it's er...

53:29.807 --> 53:32.541
These paint fumes are
making me nauseous.

53:33.910 --> 53:35.978
Yeah, I need some fresh air too.

53:42.419 --> 53:43.986
Why did you do it?

53:50.627 --> 53:54.897
Who knows why I do half
the things I do, good or bad?

53:54.899 --> 53:55.998
You're welcome.

53:59.736 --> 54:01.503
Once upon a time.

54:01.505 --> 54:03.672
I used to be afraid of heights.

54:03.674 --> 54:05.474
Not anymore?

54:05.476 --> 54:08.444
Used to get vertigo.

54:08.446 --> 54:10.779
First time I jumped
off a building...

54:10.781 --> 54:14.883
I was scared out of my mind,
I almost didn't do it.

54:14.885 --> 54:16.552
Maybe...

54:16.554 --> 54:18.587
Maybe it wasn't the height
you were afraid of.

54:18.589 --> 54:22.791
Maybe it was a part of you
that was afraid to die.

54:22.793 --> 54:25.761
I wanted to die that how
I overcame my fear.

54:27.931 --> 54:29.498
Look...

54:29.500 --> 54:31.433
If I were you...

54:31.435 --> 54:35.504
I wouldn't think of
this thing as a curse.

54:35.506 --> 54:39.041
Well think about it it's
like you're invincible.

54:39.043 --> 54:43.545
You can pretty much do anything
you want without consequence.

54:43.547 --> 54:45.414
You're not afraid to die.

54:45.416 --> 54:48.117
What are you afraid of?

54:48.119 --> 54:49.818
Clowns. Clowns?

54:49.820 --> 54:51.787
Yeah, ever since I was a kid.

54:51.789 --> 54:54.490
That's not what I
meant. I meant...

54:54.492 --> 54:57.726
There's got to be a reason.

54:57.728 --> 55:00.029
Why you want to die so badly?

55:00.031 --> 55:02.131
No don't get me wrong,
I understand what

55:02.133 --> 55:05.734
it's like to lose somebody,
believe me I do.

55:05.736 --> 55:08.437
But there's something
you're no telling me.

55:08.439 --> 55:10.873
There's something more to this.

55:10.875 --> 55:13.008
I loved Christopher.

55:13.010 --> 55:14.610
He was taken away from me.

55:14.612 --> 55:15.811
Yeah?

55:15.813 --> 55:17.680
But unless you pulled
the plug on him

55:17.682 --> 55:20.382
I don't understand why you feel
so fucking guilty about it.

55:20.384 --> 55:21.884
Who said anything about guilt?

55:21.886 --> 55:23.152
I saw your painting.

55:23.154 --> 55:25.721
That had nothing to
do with Christopher.

55:27.057 --> 55:28.891
Fine.

55:28.893 --> 55:31.427
You want my advice?

55:31.429 --> 55:33.128
You want to break this curse?

55:33.130 --> 55:35.898
You have to face what you
are really afraid of.

55:39.436 --> 55:41.570
What are you really afraid of?

57:16.166 --> 57:18.767
I see you have a
history of seizures.

57:18.769 --> 57:22.504
Diagnosed as an epileptic
three years ago.

57:22.506 --> 57:24.206
Been taking your medication?

57:26.709 --> 57:28.544
Hmm...

57:28.546 --> 57:31.647
If you care to live
a longer life...

57:31.649 --> 57:33.816
I'd follow through on this one.

57:39.956 --> 57:42.758
Former patient of mine had a
seizure a few weeks back.

57:42.760 --> 57:44.927
On her ninth floor balcony.

57:46.797 --> 57:48.797
Splat!

57:48.799 --> 57:51.066
Right in front of a bunch
of school kids.

57:51.068 --> 57:53.702
All because she wasn't
taking her medication.

57:53.704 --> 57:56.438
Yeah well um...

57:56.440 --> 57:59.074
I'm cloudy enough
without the pills.

57:59.076 --> 58:01.643
Do you have any idea
how lucky you are?

58:03.146 --> 58:07.149
You were this close
to being road kill.

58:07.151 --> 58:09.685
Nine times out of a ten,
A vehicle like that is going to

58:09.687 --> 58:12.421
crush your head
like a watermelon.

58:12.423 --> 58:13.889
I guess I got lucky.

58:15.792 --> 58:17.659
Must be here for a reason.

58:46.122 --> 58:47.523
Hey!

59:01.037 --> 59:04.139
What's wrong? What, you're not
allowed to cross the road?

59:06.576 --> 59:08.610
I can cross the street, why?

59:08.612 --> 59:11.747
Well come over here.
We'll go to this cafe.

59:11.749 --> 59:13.715
No, I been to that place before.

59:13.717 --> 59:14.950
Yeah and?

59:14.952 --> 59:18.020
I didn't like it.
So what? It's a coffee shop.

59:18.022 --> 59:20.856
I fucking hate coffee.

59:20.858 --> 59:24.026
Ah... yeah okay fine,
well where then?

59:28.164 --> 59:30.933
Look like a couple of
pedophiles in the place.

59:32.669 --> 59:34.736
I'm a gay man with an eye-patch.

59:34.738 --> 59:36.738
You think I care
what people think?

59:36.740 --> 59:39.908
But you're right, it's
an odd place for lunch.

59:39.910 --> 59:41.610
Why? It's pizza.

59:41.612 --> 59:44.846
There's a perfectly good
pizzeria across the street.

59:44.848 --> 59:45.649
Whatever.

59:48.985 --> 59:50.719
Fuck off, I'm eating.

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:06.068
Now this is what kids
do for fun, huh?

01:00:17.747 --> 01:00:20.148
This game's bullshit.

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:22.684
Well how can you not
like whack-a-croc.

01:00:24.754 --> 01:00:26.888
I don't even know what the
fuck whack-a-croc is.

01:00:26.890 --> 01:00:29.091
You have never played
whack-a-croc?

01:00:29.093 --> 01:00:31.693
Stop saying whack-a-croc.

01:00:34.665 --> 01:00:36.064
Now this...

01:00:36.066 --> 01:00:38.867
This is more fucking like it.

01:00:38.869 --> 01:00:41.703
No I think this sends the
wrong message to kids.

01:00:43.641 --> 01:00:45.874
What like a message
from God or something?

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:54.349
You're the one always talking
about... God and astrology.

01:00:54.351 --> 01:00:57.019
Fate, all that other crap.

01:00:58.555 --> 01:01:00.856
I tend to think my
belief in God is at its

01:01:00.858 --> 01:01:03.125
strongest when I need
someone to blame.

01:01:05.129 --> 01:01:07.129
Why do you think
Christopher died?

01:01:07.131 --> 01:01:08.463
Excuse me?

01:01:10.767 --> 01:01:12.434
I mean he's dead.

01:01:12.436 --> 01:01:14.770
You think that happened
for a reason?

01:01:14.772 --> 01:01:19.541
Maybe once I figure that out...
I can die in piece.

01:01:25.882 --> 01:01:27.582
Something to drink?

01:01:27.584 --> 01:01:28.984
Just water, no ice.

01:01:40.897 --> 01:01:42.164
This Annie?

01:01:45.468 --> 01:01:46.568
What's that?

01:01:48.805 --> 01:01:50.005
Is this Annie?

01:01:52.041 --> 01:01:53.508
Yeah.

01:01:58.081 --> 01:01:59.648
Cool!

01:01:59.650 --> 01:02:00.882
This an antique?

01:02:00.884 --> 01:02:02.117
Yeah, yeah, you're like a bull

01:02:02.119 --> 01:02:03.585
in a china shop. Take it easy.

01:02:03.587 --> 01:02:06.521
You listen to opera music?

01:02:06.523 --> 01:02:08.423
Yeah I do.

01:02:08.425 --> 01:02:10.559
Listen I've got this um book.

01:02:10.561 --> 01:02:12.594
I really want you to check out.

01:02:12.596 --> 01:02:13.929
Which book?

01:02:13.931 --> 01:02:16.598
- You read Voltaire much?
- I've heard of him.

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:20.435
Now well...
It's called Candide...

01:02:20.437 --> 01:02:21.903
Classic Voltaire.

01:02:21.905 --> 01:02:24.573
Highly regarded as one
of his greatest works.

01:02:24.575 --> 01:02:26.007
What's it about?

01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:28.977
Fate.

01:02:28.979 --> 01:02:31.913
That things happen and
no matter what you do...

01:02:31.915 --> 01:02:33.849
you can't change it.

01:02:33.851 --> 01:02:36.952
And all that theoretical
science bullshit, you know.

01:02:36.954 --> 01:02:38.987
I think you'd enjoy it.

01:02:40.857 --> 01:02:43.925
Have you got an aspirin?

01:02:43.927 --> 01:02:45.727
Why, you got a headache?

01:02:45.729 --> 01:02:47.896
A... everything ache.

01:02:47.898 --> 01:02:48.964
Yeah.

01:02:48.966 --> 01:02:50.499
In the bathroom.

01:02:50.501 --> 01:02:52.000
Medicine cabinet.

01:02:58.775 --> 01:03:00.609
Geez Steven...

01:03:00.611 --> 01:03:02.611
You've got
enough prescription drugs

01:03:02.613 --> 01:03:06.648
in here for a mass suicide.
- Well, feel free.

01:03:06.650 --> 01:03:09.551
Already tried it. Didn't work.

01:03:09.553 --> 01:03:11.920
God, I put this book
in here somewhere.

01:03:18.661 --> 01:03:22.464
Have you ever tried to
kill yourself before?

01:03:22.466 --> 01:03:23.965
What?

01:03:23.967 --> 01:03:25.867
You know, even thought of it?

01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:29.771
No, can't say I have.

01:03:29.773 --> 01:03:31.740
Not even a little bit?

01:03:31.742 --> 01:03:33.975
No not even a little bit.

01:03:33.977 --> 01:03:36.111
Why?

01:03:36.113 --> 01:03:38.580
I don't know Percival,
I just haven't.

01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:42.584
Hypothetically speaking...

01:03:42.586 --> 01:03:44.085
say you believed in fate.

01:03:44.087 --> 01:03:45.954
That everything has
a purpose, that

01:03:45.956 --> 01:03:47.722
everything happens for a reason.

01:03:47.724 --> 01:03:49.991
Where the fuck is this book?

01:03:49.993 --> 01:03:52.861
Why do you think Annie died?

01:03:52.863 --> 01:03:55.497
It was here two fucking
days ago, I swear to God.

01:03:55.499 --> 01:03:58.433
Why are you still here?
What's your purpose?

01:03:58.435 --> 01:03:59.768
What is this?

01:03:59.770 --> 01:04:01.770
Twenty fucking questions?

01:04:01.772 --> 01:04:03.505
I'm just curious.

01:04:03.507 --> 01:04:06.608
I'm trying to find this fucking
book and you're distracting me.

01:04:06.610 --> 01:04:07.876
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:04:07.878 --> 01:04:09.444
Sorry.

01:04:42.044 --> 01:04:43.812
Ah, got it.

01:04:43.814 --> 01:04:44.946
Found it.

01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:49.551
Percival!

01:04:57.627 --> 01:04:58.894
Percival?

01:05:04.834 --> 01:05:06.234
What the fuck?

01:06:49.972 --> 01:06:51.506
Fucking pig.

01:06:54.777 --> 01:06:56.845
Where the fuck are you going?

01:07:10.993 --> 01:07:12.427
Please.

01:07:12.429 --> 01:07:15.697
I've got a wife;
She just had a baby girl.

01:07:15.699 --> 01:07:17.165
Please, don't do it.

01:07:32.848 --> 01:07:35.083
So Officer Green's doing okay?

01:07:35.085 --> 01:07:39.421
He's in a stable condition,
nothing life threatening.

01:07:39.423 --> 01:07:41.122
He's a good man.

01:07:41.124 --> 01:07:44.125
Just had a little girl
a few weeks back.

01:07:44.127 --> 01:07:47.495
You have children Mr. Ray?

01:07:47.497 --> 01:07:48.930
No.

01:07:48.932 --> 01:07:52.067
Well he's very grateful for what
you did for him tonight.

01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:55.537
Putting yourself in harm's
way to save him life.

01:07:55.539 --> 01:07:57.639
Bullet smashed
through my window.

01:07:57.641 --> 01:08:00.575
I saw the gunfire outside.

01:08:00.577 --> 01:08:02.177
Yeah...

01:08:02.179 --> 01:08:03.978
It's funny how life works, hey?

01:08:05.482 --> 01:08:07.615
And that bullet
misses your window.

01:08:08.984 --> 01:08:11.152
Who knows?

01:08:11.154 --> 01:08:13.822
Little girl has to grow
up without a father.

01:08:18.426 --> 01:08:19.727
Is that lipstick?

01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:23.932
Look...

01:08:23.934 --> 01:08:27.569
I'm not here to judge
a man's lifestyle...

01:08:27.571 --> 01:08:30.004
You saved one of our own...

01:08:30.006 --> 01:08:32.006
We'll forever be in your debt.

01:08:36.578 --> 01:08:37.779
You're a hero.

01:08:44.653 --> 01:08:46.988
Something happened tonight man.

01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:49.524
It's hard to explain.

01:08:49.526 --> 01:08:50.959
Fate I guess... I don't know.

01:08:50.961 --> 01:08:53.094
But I had some kind of ah...

01:08:53.095 --> 01:08:54.962
Breakthrough... ha ha.

01:08:56.631 --> 01:08:59.033
I saved a man's life Percival.

01:08:59.035 --> 01:09:00.234
A policeman.

01:09:01.871 --> 01:09:03.805
At first I thought it

01:09:03.807 --> 01:09:05.707
was all one big
coincidence, you know.

01:09:05.709 --> 01:09:08.209
Then I thought about
what you said.

01:09:08.211 --> 01:09:11.112
The more I thought about it...

01:09:11.113 --> 01:09:13.581
the more I think it
happened for a reason.

01:09:13.582 --> 01:09:14.849
Why?

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:17.018
I don't know.

01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:18.685
But I've never felt like this

01:09:18.688 --> 01:09:20.622
before in my life
about anything.

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:26.594
I mean I don't know what my
purpose is. Not yet anyway.

01:09:26.595 --> 01:09:29.063
But tonight I served a
purpose, tonight...

01:09:30.832 --> 01:09:32.800
I did something purposeful.

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:37.572
Can't explain it.

01:09:37.573 --> 01:09:40.942
I don't know it was all
these different elements...

01:09:40.944 --> 01:09:42.609
Involved.

01:09:42.612 --> 01:09:46.147
When they came together,
all these pieces...

01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:48.550
It was perfect.

01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:52.187
It was like it was
always meant to be.

01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:53.787
I don't...

01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:54.956
I don't know.

01:09:57.626 --> 01:10:00.228
I don't know why...
Annie died, I don't...

01:10:02.164 --> 01:10:04.699
can't tell you why
Christopher was killed.

01:10:08.103 --> 01:10:10.171
But for the first
time in my life.

01:10:12.041 --> 01:10:14.042
Percival.

01:10:14.044 --> 01:10:16.544
My actions...

01:10:16.546 --> 01:10:19.080
My actions had a reason.

01:10:19.082 --> 01:10:20.248
A real reason.

01:10:26.922 --> 01:10:29.657
I don't know why
you're still alive.

01:10:29.659 --> 01:10:32.227
I don't know what your
purpose is Percival.

01:10:34.129 --> 01:10:35.964
I mean that's something
that you're going

01:10:35.966 --> 01:10:38.600
to have to figure
out for yourself.

01:10:38.602 --> 01:10:41.035
But I do know that...

01:10:41.037 --> 01:10:42.570
None of this...

01:10:42.572 --> 01:10:45.707
none of it could have happened
if it wasn't for you.

01:10:47.109 --> 01:10:48.810
For that I thank you.

01:10:55.117 --> 01:10:57.185
And the deal's off...

01:10:57.187 --> 01:10:59.053
You hear me? The deal's off.

01:11:02.191 --> 01:11:04.892
Money's yours.

01:11:04.894 --> 01:11:06.828
Besides...

01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:08.863
The world's better
with you in it.

01:13:03.112 --> 01:13:05.012
What the fuck is he doing?

01:13:12.821 --> 01:13:14.088
Percival!

01:13:24.566 --> 01:13:27.402
Hey! Percival.

01:13:35.544 --> 01:13:37.678
What the fuck is the
matter with you?

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:38.780
Huh?

01:13:42.151 --> 01:13:43.584
Jesus!

01:13:48.657 --> 01:13:49.757
Holy shit...

01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:53.795
Holy fucking shit.

01:13:56.031 --> 01:13:57.665
What are you doing?

01:13:57.667 --> 01:14:00.067
Huh?

01:14:00.069 --> 01:14:03.037
You honestly thought
that was going to work?

01:14:03.039 --> 01:14:06.741
Jumping in front of
fucking traffic, really?

01:14:06.743 --> 01:14:07.875
Shit.

01:14:15.851 --> 01:14:16.395
Come on.

01:14:23.193 --> 01:14:25.526
Christopher was
taken away from me.

01:14:28.564 --> 01:14:29.931
I know.

01:14:29.933 --> 01:14:31.632
I know.

01:14:31.634 --> 01:14:32.867
Come on get up.

01:14:45.981 --> 01:14:47.815
Where did you get this from?

01:14:51.019 --> 01:14:52.620
It was cold.

01:14:55.557 --> 01:14:57.492
It rained that night.

01:14:57.494 --> 01:14:58.960
The roads were wet.

01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:04.098
I was right Steven.

01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:07.101
Fate brought us together.

01:15:07.103 --> 01:15:10.571
All this happened for a reason.

01:15:10.573 --> 01:15:12.740
Where the fuck did
you get this from?

01:15:18.747 --> 01:15:22.450
Percival don't fucking
tell me it was you.

01:15:22.452 --> 01:15:25.920
Christopher was
taken away from me.

01:15:25.922 --> 01:15:27.188
I was at a bar.

01:15:34.196 --> 01:15:36.163
About that time mate.

01:15:38.066 --> 01:15:40.568
Come on pack it up,
come back tomorrow.

01:16:53.642 --> 01:16:56.510
- You told me to confront my
guilt. - SHUT THE FUCK UP!

01:16:56.512 --> 01:16:58.813
Out of all the
millions of people and

01:16:58.815 --> 01:17:01.749
cabs in this town,
I landed on yours.

01:17:01.751 --> 01:17:04.418
All of this was meant to happen.

01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:06.340
This is how it's
supposed to end.

01:17:08.190 --> 01:17:09.824
Go ahead I deserve it.

01:17:13.662 --> 01:17:14.895
Go on.

01:17:19.067 --> 01:17:21.135
It's supposed to
finish like this.

01:17:22.804 --> 01:17:24.105
Fuck!

01:17:27.209 --> 01:17:29.543
Oi! Freeze!

01:17:29.545 --> 01:17:31.012
Put down the weapon.

01:17:32.581 --> 01:17:33.748
Fuck.

01:17:38.587 --> 01:17:39.887
Fuck.

01:17:53.068 --> 01:17:56.604
He had a gun pointed
at your face.

01:17:56.606 --> 01:17:58.072
Now if there was
anyone who should

01:17:58.074 --> 01:17:59.707
be able to give
us an accurate...

01:17:59.709 --> 01:18:03.044
detailed description of the
gunman it would be you.

01:18:03.046 --> 01:18:04.879
And yet...

01:18:04.881 --> 01:18:06.247
You don't recall.

01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:10.751
Perhaps you don't
realize how lucky

01:18:10.753 --> 01:18:12.286
you are to be alive right now.

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:06.574
Can I help you?

01:19:13.215 --> 01:19:15.182
- What's this?
- Read it.

01:19:20.622 --> 01:19:21.956
I don't understand.

01:19:21.958 --> 01:19:24.525
That's your license
plate number Frank.

01:19:28.663 --> 01:19:31.065
How do you have this?

01:19:31.067 --> 01:19:34.268
Because I know everything there
is to know about you Frank.

01:19:42.010 --> 01:19:44.578
Who are you?

01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:46.080
How do you know my name?

01:19:46.082 --> 01:19:48.549
I've killed a lot
of people Frank.

01:19:48.551 --> 01:19:50.050
Excuse me?

01:19:50.052 --> 01:19:53.888
I killed people even
before Annie died.

01:19:53.890 --> 01:19:56.590
After she passed, I just...

01:19:56.592 --> 01:19:59.627
I don't know, I started
to think like...

01:19:59.629 --> 01:20:01.762
Maybe I was doing
it for a reason.

01:20:07.636 --> 01:20:08.836
I saw...

01:20:08.838 --> 01:20:12.706
the license plate number
on the car Frank.

01:20:12.708 --> 01:20:13.874
I saw.

01:20:15.610 --> 01:20:17.812
Clear as fucking day. I saw it.

01:20:20.115 --> 01:20:24.185
But when I woke up I just,
I couldn't remember it.

01:20:24.187 --> 01:20:26.887
A few letters and numbers
stood out but...

01:20:26.889 --> 01:20:29.623
I just couldn't put it together.

01:20:29.625 --> 01:20:30.858
Check please.

01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:33.060
I thought I had it remembered.

01:20:33.062 --> 01:20:34.962
It was there, it was there!

01:20:36.565 --> 01:20:38.966
I just... I couldn't reach it.

01:20:38.968 --> 01:20:40.968
I don't know what you're
talking about but

01:20:40.970 --> 01:20:43.070
you're starting to give
me the creeps, okay.

01:20:43.072 --> 01:20:45.906
So I hit my head.

01:20:45.908 --> 01:20:47.842
And it was hard for
me to remember.

01:20:47.844 --> 01:20:49.076
Hey, who is this guy?

01:20:49.078 --> 01:20:50.611
So I just...

01:20:50.613 --> 01:20:52.580
I killed anyone who's...
number-plate

01:20:52.582 --> 01:20:54.114
that came even remotely close...

01:20:54.116 --> 01:20:55.749
to what I had in my head.

01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:00.721
Hey pal...

01:21:00.723 --> 01:21:02.756
I think you've had enough, yeah.

01:21:04.626 --> 01:21:05.726
What?

01:21:05.728 --> 01:21:07.461
It's time for you to go.

01:21:07.463 --> 01:21:09.763
Listen... Time to die.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

01:21:09.765 --> 01:21:12.099
Can you not fucking
see that I am

01:21:12.101 --> 01:21:14.935
in the middle of
something important.

01:21:14.937 --> 01:21:16.237
Yeah.

01:21:16.239 --> 01:21:17.504
Good.

01:21:17.506 --> 01:21:18.572
Thank you.

01:21:21.109 --> 01:21:23.043
Then your number-plate...

01:21:23.045 --> 01:21:25.679
came up Frank.

01:21:25.681 --> 01:21:28.549
Your number came up.

01:21:28.551 --> 01:21:31.585
And I thought for
the longest time.

01:21:31.587 --> 01:21:33.621
I thought you were the one.

01:21:33.623 --> 01:21:35.055
Look fellow...

01:21:35.057 --> 01:21:37.558
I think you got the
wrong person here.

01:21:38.894 --> 01:21:42.029
I nearly killed you Frank.

01:21:42.031 --> 01:21:43.998
I nearly fucking killed you.

01:21:46.101 --> 01:21:48.669
But you got lucky...

01:21:48.671 --> 01:21:50.971
You got real lucky.

01:21:50.973 --> 01:21:54.074
Luckier that the rest anyway.

01:21:54.076 --> 01:21:56.010
Why do you think that was?

01:21:56.012 --> 01:21:57.645
We, I-I-I don't know.

01:21:59.614 --> 01:22:02.016
Do you think it was
fate that saved you?

01:22:03.919 --> 01:22:06.553
I mean if I put two bullets...

01:22:06.555 --> 01:22:09.056
right between your eyes
right now as we speak.

01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:15.529
That would pretty much trump the
idea of fate now wouldn't it?

01:22:15.531 --> 01:22:18.599
Or would that just be what was
meant to be all along.

01:22:20.035 --> 01:22:21.669
Is it fate?

01:22:21.671 --> 01:22:24.872
Or is it because of my free will
you continue to be alive?

01:22:29.210 --> 01:22:30.644
And I don't know...

01:22:36.017 --> 01:22:37.651
I don't fucking know.

01:22:44.225 --> 01:22:45.926
Be thankful... Frank.

01:22:47.729 --> 01:22:48.829
Be thankful.

01:23:09.050 --> 01:23:10.217
Hello Steven.

01:23:14.456 --> 01:23:15.723
I can't do it.

01:23:19.995 --> 01:23:21.095
You have to.

01:23:23.064 --> 01:23:25.599
But, before you do.

01:23:25.601 --> 01:23:27.601
I need you to forgive me first.

01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:32.906
Please.

01:23:32.908 --> 01:23:34.908
Please Steven forgive me for...

01:23:37.245 --> 01:23:38.312
I'm sorry.

01:23:46.654 --> 01:23:47.888
Me to.

01:23:51.259 --> 01:23:52.559
Forgive me.

01:23:54.029 --> 01:23:55.329
I can't do that.

01:24:00.602 --> 01:24:02.236
Please, not yet.

01:25:52.213 --> 01:25:54.214
So how did you know Percival?

01:25:56.584 --> 01:25:59.086
He was, um...

01:25:59.088 --> 01:26:01.788
We were friends.

01:26:01.790 --> 01:26:03.056
I'm Todd.

01:26:03.058 --> 01:26:04.625
Percival's brother.

01:26:07.095 --> 01:26:08.195
Steven.

01:26:08.197 --> 01:26:09.296
Yeah.

01:26:11.866 --> 01:26:13.700
You... ah... you guys close?

01:26:16.938 --> 01:26:18.872
Yeah.

01:26:18.874 --> 01:26:20.140
Yeah, we were.

01:26:22.844 --> 01:26:24.211
He... ah...

01:26:24.213 --> 01:26:26.246
kept most people at a distance.

01:26:28.650 --> 01:26:31.051
Even me...

01:26:31.053 --> 01:26:33.187
Especially after
Christopher died.

01:26:38.526 --> 01:26:40.561
Look... um...

01:26:40.563 --> 01:26:44.731
As you know, Percival
was quite the artist.

01:26:44.733 --> 01:26:46.533
Yeah, I saw.

01:26:46.535 --> 01:26:48.769
Some of his work. He was...

01:26:48.771 --> 01:26:50.871
Very talented.

01:26:50.873 --> 01:26:53.040
Yeah.

01:26:53.042 --> 01:26:55.642
Look he... ah...

01:26:55.644 --> 01:26:58.078
One of his favorite galleries
is putting on a...

01:26:58.080 --> 01:26:59.980
exhibition of his work.

01:27:01.749 --> 01:27:03.116
As a memorial.

01:27:05.587 --> 01:27:07.888
I think he'd like it
if you could come.

01:27:12.727 --> 01:27:13.827
Yeah.

01:27:16.497 --> 01:27:17.764
Thank you.

01:27:17.766 --> 01:27:18.865
Thank you.

01:27:29.577 --> 01:27:31.078
I don't believe you.

01:27:32.847 --> 01:27:35.582
I don't give a fuck what
you believe or not.

01:27:38.086 --> 01:27:39.319
Because I'm done.

01:27:42.724 --> 01:27:44.625
You're a killer.

01:27:44.627 --> 01:27:46.026
You always were.

01:27:47.562 --> 01:27:49.529
There's no sense in
trying to change

01:27:49.531 --> 01:27:51.131
it. Because that's what you are.

01:28:09.917 --> 01:28:11.685
This conversation's over.

01:28:13.021 --> 01:28:14.554
For now, Steven.

01:28:16.724 --> 01:28:17.791
For now.

01:28:33.107 --> 01:28:34.207
He... ah...

01:28:34.209 --> 01:28:37.110
He painted this not long
after Christopher passed.

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:40.213
Steven, right?

01:28:42.016 --> 01:28:43.216
Yup.

01:28:43.218 --> 01:28:45.152
You're... um...

01:28:45.154 --> 01:28:46.453
Todd.

01:28:46.455 --> 01:28:47.988
Percival's brother. Yeah.

01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:49.656
It's good to see you.

01:28:49.658 --> 01:28:51.258
Glad you could make it.

01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:54.528
You know I... ah...

01:28:54.530 --> 01:28:56.897
I always admired his talent
you know, even as a kid.

01:28:56.899 --> 01:29:00.000
He was always
painting and drawing.

01:29:00.002 --> 01:29:01.234
Just...

01:29:01.236 --> 01:29:03.804
Not so sure I'm fond
of his recent work.

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:07.107
It's beautiful.

01:29:09.977 --> 01:29:12.946
Yeah... yeah I suppose.

01:29:12.948 --> 01:29:14.915
It's just so dark.

01:29:14.917 --> 01:29:16.083
Depressing.

01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:22.589
Heartbreaking actually.

01:29:22.591 --> 01:29:25.492
To have someone you
hold so dear be so...

01:29:25.494 --> 01:29:27.494
sad.

01:29:27.496 --> 01:29:28.829
Just...

01:29:28.831 --> 01:29:30.831
I just hope he found
some sort of closure

01:29:30.833 --> 01:29:32.793
before he left this
world, you know?

01:29:34.569 --> 01:29:38.205
This... ah, is some
of his earlier stuff.

01:29:38.207 --> 01:29:40.107
You can see the difference.

01:29:41.676 --> 01:29:45.112
This is how I prefer
to remember him.

01:29:45.114 --> 01:29:47.180
I remember him...

01:29:47.182 --> 01:29:49.983
working on this one.

01:29:49.985 --> 01:29:51.585
Yeah this... ah...

01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:55.222
This was the last thing he did.

01:29:55.224 --> 01:29:57.657
Christopher.

01:29:57.659 --> 01:29:59.259
Yeah.

01:29:59.261 --> 01:30:01.661
Yeah he painted this
totally from memory.

01:30:01.663 --> 01:30:03.930
No photos, no pictures, nothing.

01:30:03.932 --> 01:30:05.265
It's amazing isn't it?

01:30:08.002 --> 01:30:11.238
Yeah I knew Christopher
quite well and ah...

01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:14.741
No this... this really
captures his essence.

01:30:26.687 --> 01:30:28.188
Excuse me can you not see

01:30:28.190 --> 01:30:30.257
we are in the middle
of a conversation here?

01:30:30.259 --> 01:30:33.660
Oh I'm sorry I thought
this place was a store.

01:30:44.639 --> 01:30:47.073
Did you... ah... ever
meet Christopher?
