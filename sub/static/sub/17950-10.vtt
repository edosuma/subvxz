THE CLOSE ENCOUNTER SIGHTING.

09:28.636 --> 09:29.737
THIS JUST IN:

09:29.737 --> 09:31.805
OUR NEWS COPTER
HAS SPOTTED THE ALIENS,

09:31.805 --> 09:34.274
AND WE ARE
TAKING YOU THERE LIVE.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.677
[helicopter blades whirring]

09:36.677 --> 09:38.478
- DOOP!

09:38.478 --> 09:40.013
- THERE ARE ALIENS DOWNTOWN,

09:40.013 --> 09:42.515
AND THEY HAVE GREEN
AND WHITE SKIN LIKE US,

09:42.515 --> 09:44.251
AND THEY'RE AT
A BIG BUY LIKE US.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.185
HA...

09:48.555 --> 09:50.457
OH.

09:50.457 --> 09:52.392
- GREAT, EITHER BIG TIME RUSH
GETS ARRESTED

09:52.392 --> 09:54.427
FOR CAUSING A CITYWIDE PANIC,

09:54.427 --> 09:55.663
OR WE GET PROBED.

09:55.663 --> 09:57.497
- OKAY, CALM DOWN.

09:57.497 --> 09:59.232
WE HAVE GOTTEN OUT
OF A LOT WORSE THAN THIS,

09:59.232 --> 10:00.600
AND WHAT IS THAT?

10:00.600 --> 10:02.936
- LOOKS LIKE SOME SORT
OF FEDERAL AUTHORITIES

10:02.936 --> 10:03.937
ARE ARRIVING ON THE SCENE.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.139
IT IS A TENSE STANDOFF.

10:17.117 --> 10:21.121
- ALIENS, WE MEAN YOU NO HARM...

10:21.121 --> 10:22.790
- UNLESS YOU MEAN US HARM.

10:22.790 --> 10:25.092
THEN WE'LL BE FORCED TO USE
OUR TRANSFORMATION LASERS.

10:26.694 --> 10:28.395
- * AH, AH, AH-AH, OH

10:28.395 --> 10:29.897
- YEAH, IT'S NEVER BEEN
WORSE THAN THIS.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.536
- WE SHOULD HAVE DONE
THE CARTOON.

10:36.536 --> 10:39.472
[sirens wailing]

10:41.141 --> 10:43.410
- YOU CAN COME ALONG PEACEFULLY,

10:43.410 --> 10:46.179
BUT WE PREFER
TO TAKE YOU BY FORCE.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.048
- YOU HAVE FIVE EARTH SECONDS
TO DECIDE.

10:53.687 --> 10:54.688
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:54.688 --> 10:56.824
- FOLLOW THE SHOES.

10:59.126 --> 11:03.130
[all screaming]

11:03.130 --> 11:04.131
- THEY'RE FAST.

11:04.131 --> 11:05.132
- WE'LL CATCH THEM.

11:05.132 --> 11:07.467
[sirens wailing]

11:07.467 --> 11:08.869
[all whimpering]

11:08.869 --> 11:11.171
- WHERE ARE WE GOING?
AND DON'T SAY, "DUMPSTER."

11:11.171 --> 11:13.073
- DUMPSTERS HAVE BEEN
VERY GOOD TO US.

11:13.073 --> 11:15.008
[all yelling]

11:16.143 --> 11:19.079
[sirens wailing]

11:22.115 --> 11:24.117
- HEY, LOOK.

11:24.117 --> 11:26.386
I GOT MY WINGS.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.355
- I DON'T LIKE THIS.

11:28.355 --> 11:31.291
I WANT TO CHANGE COSMO BOB
BACK INTO BUDDHA BOB.

11:31.291 --> 11:32.459
- OOH.

11:32.459 --> 11:34.594
- WHY?

11:34.594 --> 11:35.829
SINCE BUDDHA BOB BECAME A FAIRY,

11:35.829 --> 11:37.164
MY SINK GOT UNCLOGGED,

11:37.164 --> 11:38.631
HE GOT RID OF TUBA GUY,

11:38.631 --> 11:42.402
POOFED US UP A FREE LUNCH
AND ME A FAUX FUR COAT.

11:43.871 --> 11:45.939
- NOT WISHES, COINCIDENCES.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.775
THAT JACKET
WAS DELIVERED TO 2-J,

11:47.775 --> 11:50.643
BUT IT WAS ADDRESSED
TO REBECCA JOHNSON.

11:50.643 --> 11:52.813
- BUT I WISHED FOR IT.

11:52.813 --> 11:55.115
BESIDES, HE'S NOT
A DANGER TO ANYONE.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.450
SO THERE'S NO REASON
TO CALL DOC HOLLYWOOD.

11:57.450 --> 11:59.252
SEE?

11:59.252 --> 12:01.254
- WAIT.
WHERE IS HE?

12:01.254 --> 12:04.191
- WHEE!

12:06.093 --> 12:09.662
LOOK, WITH MY WINGS, I CAN FLY.

12:09.662 --> 12:11.799
- OKAY, YOU CAN CALL
DOC HOLLYWOOD.

12:11.799 --> 12:15.435
- I WISH YOU WERE OFF THE ROOF
AND IN THE LOBBY.

12:15.435 --> 12:17.604
- OKAY, POOF!

12:17.604 --> 12:20.340
- YOU KNOW, I'VE SEEN SOME CASES
LIKE THIS BEFORE.

12:20.340 --> 12:23.210
THE PSYCHOSIS CAN BE PERMANENT
IF NOT TREATED CORRECTLY.

12:23.210 --> 12:24.644
- HE'S DREAMY,

12:24.644 --> 12:25.946
BUT I DON'T LIKE HIM.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.114
- I WISH YOU WOULD LIKE HIM.

12:27.114 --> 12:28.648
- OKAY, I LIKE HIM.

12:28.648 --> 12:32.152
- AND AS WITH
ANY OTHER CARTOON HEAD INJURY,

12:32.152 --> 12:34.888
THE CURE CAN BE COMPLICATED.

12:34.888 --> 12:36.256
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

12:36.256 --> 12:37.357
[frying pan clangs]

12:37.357 --> 12:39.526
- [gasps]

12:39.526 --> 12:40.627
DID IT WORK?

12:40.627 --> 12:41.895
- SORRY, GUYS,

12:41.895 --> 12:44.731
BUT MY BOSS SAYS I HAVE
TO CHARGE YOU FOR THE PIZZA.

12:44.731 --> 12:46.066
- AND IS THAT THE JACKET
I ORDERED?

12:46.066 --> 12:48.601
- [playing tuba]

12:48.601 --> 12:51.604
THE GUAM PHILHARMONIC FOLDED
DUE TO LACK OF FUNDS,

12:51.604 --> 12:53.340
AND I'M BACK, EVERYONE.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.508
*

12:55.508 --> 12:58.445
- YUP, BUDDHA BOB IS BACK.

12:58.445 --> 12:59.379
- WHO'S BUDDHA BOB?

13:03.851 --> 13:05.853
[horn honks distantly]

13:05.853 --> 13:07.054
- HERE'S THE PLAN:

13:07.054 --> 13:09.056
LOGAN COMES UP WITH A PLAN.

13:09.056 --> 13:11.491
- O-OKAY.
FIRST, WE PRAY.

13:11.491 --> 13:12.960
[all murmuring]

13:12.960 --> 13:14.727
THEN WE MAKE A BREAK
FOR ROCQUE RECORDS,

13:14.727 --> 13:15.963
BURN THESE BALL SUITS,

13:15.963 --> 13:17.865
AND THEN MAKE SOME
STORY SUGGESTIONS FOR BUTCH,

13:17.865 --> 13:18.999
AND THEN DO THE CARTOON.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.200
- NICE.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.134
RUN!

13:23.570 --> 13:24.504
- [groans]

13:26.106 --> 13:27.274
LET'S DO THE OTHER WAY.

13:27.274 --> 13:28.275
- YEAH.
- GO, GO, GO, GO.

13:28.275 --> 13:30.410
- YEP, YEP.
- GO, GO, GO, GO.

13:30.410 --> 13:31.344
- OH!

13:36.716 --> 13:38.118
- WE ARE SO PROBED.

13:38.118 --> 13:40.988
[all talking at once]

13:40.988 --> 13:42.189
- NO!

13:42.189 --> 13:43.790
IT'S LOCKED.

13:43.790 --> 13:45.358
- WHY DOES THAT NOT SURPRISE ME?

13:48.061 --> 13:49.897
- WE'D SAY WE'RE SORRY
IT HAD TO COME TO THIS,

13:49.897 --> 13:51.899
BUT WE'RE NOT.

13:51.899 --> 13:53.901
- AND NOW WE GOT
TO TAKE YOU DOWN.

13:55.335 --> 13:59.272
[lasers humming]

13:59.272 --> 14:01.508
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:01.508 --> 14:05.178
- IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE TRYING
TO COMMUNICATE THROUGH DANCE.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.279
- THEY'RE GOOD.

14:06.279 --> 14:08.481
WE'VE STILL GOT
TO TAKE THEM DOWN.

14:08.481 --> 14:10.183
- IT'S THE SHOES...

14:10.183 --> 14:11.184
THAT GIVE YOU...

14:11.184 --> 14:12.752
DANCE FU!

14:16.689 --> 14:19.426
- HUH, THOSE ARE MAGICAL SHOES.

14:19.426 --> 14:21.128
- BUT THEY CAN'T BE
IN THE CARTOON.

14:24.564 --> 14:27.567
- OKAY, GREAT, BUT THERE'S STILL
AN ALIEN HUNT OUT FOR US.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.502
- AND THE DUMPSTER IS NOT
GONNA HELP US THIS TIME.

14:29.502 --> 14:31.238
- BUT WAIT.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.175
- TOLD YOU DUMPSTERS
HAVE BEEN GOOD TO US.

14:35.175 --> 14:38.111
[all yelling]

14:42.482 --> 14:44.952
- I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY THIS,
BUT...

14:44.952 --> 14:45.953
WE LOOK GOOD.

14:45.953 --> 14:48.956
[siren wails]

14:50.357 --> 14:52.492
- OKAY, LET'S DO THE CARTOON.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.364
- FELLAS, WE CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW MUCH WE LOVED

14:57.364 --> 15:00.500
ALL YOUR AWESOME BIG TIME
CARTOON STORY SUGGESTIONS.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.402
- BUT HOW DID YOU
THINK OF THEM SO FAST?

15:02.402 --> 15:04.337
[all talking at once]

15:04.337 --> 15:06.606
- IT'S A LONG STORY.

15:06.606 --> 15:09.009
- WELL, LISTEN, I PUT ALL
THE IDEAS INTO THE CARTOON,

15:09.009 --> 15:11.244
AND, CARLOS, EVEN BETTER
THAN MAGICAL SHOES--

15:11.244 --> 15:13.346
I GAVE YOU A CUTE PIG
NAMED SNORT SNORT.

15:14.681 --> 15:16.349
all: SO HOW'S IT START?

15:16.349 --> 15:17.517
- PICTURE THIS.

15:17.517 --> 15:20.387
YOU'RE ON YOUR TOUR PLANE
IN A STORM.

15:22.489 --> 15:23.490
AND THEN...

15:23.490 --> 15:24.891
[thunder rumbling]

15:24.891 --> 15:28.561
- WHY DID WE HAVE TO TAKE A TOUR
PLANE TO A CONCERT IN AUSTRALIA?

15:28.561 --> 15:30.897
WHY COULDN'T WE TAKE
A TOUR SUBMARINE INSTEAD?

15:30.897 --> 15:33.566
- BECAUSE CARLOS
IS AFRAID OF WATER.

15:33.566 --> 15:35.235
- DID SOMEBODY SAY, "WATER"?

15:35.235 --> 15:36.336
[thunder rumbling]

15:36.336 --> 15:38.605
- UH, DID SOMEBODY SAY,
"WEIRD LIGHTNING"?

15:38.605 --> 15:41.341
[electricity zapping]

15:41.341 --> 15:42.609
[beeping]

15:42.609 --> 15:45.012
- SOMETHING JUST SHORT-CIRCUITED
THE CONTROL PANELS.

15:45.012 --> 15:48.148
HOLD TIGHT, TEENS, AND
TAKE YOUR EMERGENCY POSITIONS.

15:48.148 --> 15:51.084
[all yelling]

15:53.453 --> 15:54.921
- HANG ON, SNORT SNORT.

15:54.921 --> 15:57.090
IT'S GONNA BE A BUMPY LANDING.

16:04.331 --> 16:06.366
[airplane crashes]

16:08.901 --> 16:11.604
[radio static]

16:11.604 --> 16:13.206
- I CAN'T GET A SIGNAL.

16:13.206 --> 16:15.575
I'LL LEAVE YOU TEENS ALONE
AND UNPROTECTED

16:15.575 --> 16:18.645
WHILE I RADIO FOR HELP ATOP
THAT TALL, SCARY PEAK.

16:21.948 --> 16:25.685
- GREAT, NOW WE'RE STUCK ALONE
ON A WEIRD AND DESERTED ISLAND.

16:25.685 --> 16:28.221
- DESERTED?
AWESOME!

16:28.221 --> 16:29.789
ME AND SNORT SNORT
HAVEN'T HAD DESSERT

16:29.789 --> 16:31.691
SINCE WE GOT OFF THE PLANE.

16:34.261 --> 16:36.296
[Carlos and Snort Snort gag]

16:36.296 --> 16:38.398
THIS ISLAND TASTES TERRIBLE.

16:38.398 --> 16:39.666
- THIS IS BAD.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.368
OUR CONCERT IS IN THREE HOURS,

16:41.368 --> 16:43.670
AND GUSTAVO IS GOING TO FREAK
IF WE'RE LATE.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.172
[screams]

16:45.172 --> 16:47.374
WE'RE STUCK IN A NET?

16:49.276 --> 16:51.678
- SOMETHING TELLS ME
THIS ISLAND ISN'T DESERTED.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.580
- [gags]
YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.556
- WHO ARE YOU,
AND WHAT DO YOU WANT?

17:03.556 --> 17:05.892
- WE ARE THE LIZARDIANS,

17:05.892 --> 17:07.560
AND WE'VE COME TO YOUR PLANET

17:07.560 --> 17:12.999
TO TURN THE PEOPLE OF EARTH
INTO OUR APE SERVANTS

17:12.999 --> 17:15.135
LIKE OUR FIRST TEST SUBJECT

17:15.135 --> 17:19.539
AFTER WE FORCED YOUR PLANE
TO LAND ON THIS DESERTED ISLAND.

17:19.539 --> 17:22.242
- [spits]
- I THINK THAT'S OUR PILOT.

17:22.242 --> 17:25.512
- I AM YOUR APE SERVANT.

17:25.512 --> 17:28.215
I AM HERE TO SERVE YOU...

17:28.215 --> 17:29.582
APELY.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.684
- THAT WAS OUR PILOT.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.520
- ONCE WE SUCCESSFULLY TEST

17:33.520 --> 17:37.657
OUR DNA SUPER MUTATION LASER
ON ALL OF YOU,

17:37.657 --> 17:42.395
WE'LL TURN ALL EARTHLINGS
INTO OUR APE SERVANTS.

17:42.395 --> 17:45.332
[laser whirring]

17:48.635 --> 17:50.570
- OKAY, CAN WE TALK ABOUT THIS?

17:50.570 --> 17:52.772
'CAUSE I DON'T THINK
I'D LOOK GOOD AS AN APE.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.441
AND AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I WAS JUST--

[screams]

17:57.310 --> 17:59.146
[quacks]

17:59.146 --> 18:00.347
- YOU KNOW, HE'S RIGHT.

18:00.347 --> 18:02.849
THAT IS THE WORST LOOKING APE
I'VE EVER SEEN.

18:02.849 --> 18:03.850

TO BE AN APE MAN.

18:10.957 --> 18:13.426
[laser whirring]

18:13.426 --> 18:14.427
- [brays]

18:14.427 --> 18:15.428
WHAT?

18:16.696 --> 18:18.165
- WHOSE CUP IS THIS?

18:18.165 --> 18:20.767
I SAID, "NO BEVERAGES
IN THE COMMAND CENTER."

18:20.767 --> 18:22.669
I WANT APE SERVANTS!

18:22.669 --> 18:25.037
DONKEY SERVANTS ARE JUST STUPID.

18:25.037 --> 18:26.873
LOCK THEM AWAY.

18:26.873 --> 18:29.075
WE HAVE TO FIX THIS LASER
AT ONCE.

18:35.215 --> 18:37.284
- AND WE HAVE
TO DESTROY THAT LASER

18:37.284 --> 18:39.852
BEFORE THOSE LIZARD CREEPS
TAKE OVER OUR WORLD.

18:39.852 --> 18:42.189
- OKAY, CAN WE TALK ABOUT ME
FOR A SECOND?

18:42.189 --> 18:43.190

[chuckles]

18:46.859 --> 18:48.295
WELL, ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS

18:48.295 --> 18:50.263
DEFEAT AN ADVANCED
ALIEN LIZARD RACE

18:50.263 --> 18:52.232
WITH HUGE ALIEN LIZARD WEAPONS,

18:52.232 --> 18:53.966
WORK THEIR GIANT MUTATING LASER,

18:53.966 --> 18:56.369
OH, AND GET OUT OF THIS CELL,

18:56.369 --> 18:57.837
WHICH WE CAN'T!

18:57.837 --> 18:59.906

18:59.906 --> 19:01.741
BUT YOU FORGOT ABOUT...

19:01.741 --> 19:02.942
- SNORT SNORT.

- WAY TO GO, SNORT SNORT.
[brays]

19:20.126 --> 19:21.894
- OKAY, BUT WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

19:21.894 --> 19:25.232
- WE HAVE TO STEAL
THAT HEART-SHAPED REACTOR.

19:25.232 --> 19:28.000
- YEAH, IT MUST BE
WHAT DRIVES THE LASER.

19:30.437 --> 19:32.138
- ONLY AFTER YOU CHANGE ME BACK.

19:32.138 --> 19:33.340
[brays]

19:33.340 --> 19:34.574
[braying echoes]

19:34.574 --> 19:37.677
- AND WE HAVE TO CONTROL
JAMES' DONKEY NOISES.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.946
- THE EARTH TEENS HAVE ESCAPED.

19:39.946 --> 19:41.448
GET THEM.

19:41.448 --> 19:45.752
- OKAY, AND NOW WE MOVE!
