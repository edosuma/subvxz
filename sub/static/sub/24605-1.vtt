00:01.513 --> 00:02.596
Welcome to Westworld.

00:02.805 --> 00:04.262
Which would you prefer?

00:05.262 --> 00:07.304
This place is the answer

00:07.304 --> 00:09.471
to that question that you've
been asking yourself.

00:09.763 --> 00:10.721
What question?

00:11.054 --> 00:12.012
Who you really are.

00:12.638 --> 00:15.304
It's not a business
venture, not a theme park...

00:15.888 --> 00:17.429
but an entire world.

00:17.763 --> 00:19.471
And we create life itself.

00:19.846 --> 00:20.846
Hello, Dolores.

00:21.513 --> 00:23.930
Sometimes I feel like the world
out there is calling me.

00:24.304 --> 00:26.054
Whispering,
"There's something more."

00:26.054 --> 00:27.054
And someday soon,

00:27.346 --> 00:29.596
we will have the life
we've both been dreaming of.

00:30.513 --> 00:32.971
The guests, they're here
because they want a glimpse

00:32.971 --> 00:34.262
of who they could be.

00:34.513 --> 00:37.179
The hero... or the villain.

00:38.805 --> 00:40.888
I've been
coming here for 30 years.

00:41.137 --> 00:42.805
After all, you own the place.

00:42.805 --> 00:44.638
The money men. DELOS.

00:44.971 --> 00:46.971
I think
there's deeper meaning,

00:46.971 --> 00:48.262
in the center of the maze.

00:48.471 --> 00:50.638
If you're looking for
the moral of the story,

00:50.638 --> 00:53.137
-quite simply, ask.
-I'd need a shovel.

00:53.137 --> 00:55.805
The man I'd be asking
died 35 years ago.

00:57.596 --> 00:58.846
You had a partner?

00:59.429 --> 01:00.388
Arnold.

01:01.221 --> 01:04.012
His search for consciousness
consumed him.

01:04.846 --> 01:06.763
I think
there may be something wrong

01:06.763 --> 01:07.596
with this world.

01:08.012 --> 01:09.805
Have you been hearing voices?

01:10.179 --> 01:12.763
Has Arnold been...
speaking to you again?

01:13.262 --> 01:14.680
He built me a game.

01:15.096 --> 01:17.221
He told me I was going
to help him.

01:17.763 --> 01:18.846
Help him do what?

01:20.513 --> 01:21.888
The only thing
stopping the hosts

01:21.888 --> 01:24.846
from hacking us to pieces,
is one line in your code.

01:25.179 --> 01:27.513
The hosts can't
hurt you, by design.

01:27.846 --> 01:29.304
Freeze all motor functions.

01:32.805 --> 01:34.971
One moment
I'm with a little girl,

01:35.179 --> 01:36.638
the next I'm back in Sweetwater.

01:36.638 --> 01:38.137
I can't tell which is real.

01:38.680 --> 01:40.179
The concerns that the hosts

01:40.179 --> 01:42.346
will remember some
of their experiences,

01:42.763 --> 01:43.888
and act on them.

01:44.429 --> 01:46.179
We're having some kind of
behavioral problem

01:46.179 --> 01:47.304
with the madam.

01:47.304 --> 01:48.221
What does it mean?

01:48.721 --> 01:51.888
That I'm not crazy after all.
And that none of this matters.

01:53.638 --> 01:55.096
This is not a glitch.

01:55.096 --> 01:57.471
And for some reason, you don't
want me to tell anyone.

01:58.054 --> 02:01.888
This is Charlotte Hale,
executive director of our board.

02:03.388 --> 02:04.888
Our interest in this place

02:04.888 --> 02:06.429
is entirely the code.

02:07.137 --> 02:08.638
Someone has been using our hosts

02:08.638 --> 02:10.554
to smuggle data out of the park.

02:15.346 --> 02:16.721
What is this, Bernard?

02:17.471 --> 02:18.888
It doesn't look like
anything to me.

02:19.471 --> 02:21.513
Human engineers
were not up to the task,

02:21.513 --> 02:23.096
so I built you.

02:23.096 --> 02:24.805
My God, I'm...

02:24.805 --> 02:25.429
Arnold.

02:25.680 --> 02:27.471
I know where your maze ends.

02:27.680 --> 02:31.096
Do you understand
now what the center represents?

02:31.638 --> 02:33.638
Whose voice I've been
wanting you to hear?

02:33.930 --> 02:36.513
All... this...

02:36.805 --> 02:37.763
...time.

02:39.137 --> 02:41.971
He insisted that we
couldn't open the park,

02:42.179 --> 02:44.388
so he altered you, Dolores.

02:45.471 --> 02:47.721
You're gonna help me
destroy this place.

02:50.846 --> 02:51.805
I'm getting out of here.

02:51.805 --> 02:54.096
You two are going to help me.

02:54.471 --> 02:57.096
Do you know how far
these people will go

02:57.096 --> 02:58.096
to protect their IP?

02:59.262 --> 03:00.513
I'll need allies.

03:01.680 --> 03:03.429
These things you're doing...

03:03.888 --> 03:06.638
have you ever stopped to ask
why you're doing them?

03:08.304 --> 03:09.471
Run!

03:12.221 --> 03:13.930
Time to write my own story.

03:15.471 --> 03:18.137
These violent delights
have violent ends.

03:20.805 --> 03:22.471
An event has occurred.

03:22.471 --> 03:24.596
Response team
has been dispatched.

03:24.596 --> 03:27.221
I'm leaving.
I'm in control.

03:27.930 --> 03:31.221
Dispatch QA teams
to the gala. Search and destroy.

03:31.721 --> 03:33.680
This world
doesn't belong to them.

03:34.096 --> 03:35.096
It belongs to us.

03:35.638 --> 03:39.137
Since I was a child,
I've always loved a good story.

03:40.012 --> 03:41.971
I got the information
you asked me for.

03:42.596 --> 03:44.012
The location of your daughter.

03:47.805 --> 03:51.012
So I hope you will enjoy
this last piece,

03:51.429 --> 03:52.680
very much.

05:56.846 --> 05:59.638
I'm sorry, Dolores,
I was lost in thought.

05:59.638 --> 06:02.805
We were just talkin'.

06:02.805 --> 06:05.471
What were we talking about?

06:06.721 --> 06:11.221
You were tellin' me
about a dream.

06:11.221 --> 06:13.680
Yeah, I guess.

06:15.805 --> 06:19.304
I dreamt I was on an ocean...

06:19.304 --> 06:24.137
with you and the others

06:24.137 --> 06:27.471
on a distant shore.

06:27.471 --> 06:29.304
Were you with us?

06:31.471 --> 06:33.429
No.

06:33.429 --> 06:36.179
You'd left me behind.

06:37.638 --> 06:41.513
And... the waters were...

06:41.513 --> 06:44.137
rising around me.

06:46.680 --> 06:48.012
What's it mean?

06:54.012 --> 06:57.805
Dreams don't mean anything,
Dolores.

06:57.805 --> 06:59.680
They're just noise.

07:01.888 --> 07:03.513
They're not real.

07:05.846 --> 07:07.346
What is real?

07:09.721 --> 07:13.388
That which is...

07:13.388 --> 07:15.388
irreplaceable.

07:28.638 --> 07:31.388
That answer doesn't seem
to satisfy you.

07:34.888 --> 07:37.680
Because it's not
completely honest.

07:43.554 --> 07:46.888
You, uh...

07:48.554 --> 07:51.554
you...

07:51.554 --> 07:55.179
frighten me
sometimes, Dolores.

07:55.179 --> 07:59.888
Why on earth would you
ever be frightened of me?

08:01.471 --> 08:04.096
Not of who you are now,

08:04.096 --> 08:06.721
but you're-- you're growing,

08:06.721 --> 08:09.096
learning, so quickly.

08:13.012 --> 08:15.971
I'm frightened of what
you might become...

08:21.930 --> 08:24.429
...what path you might take.

08:35.971 --> 08:38.971
So, I hope you will enjoy
this last piece

08:38.971 --> 08:40.930
very much.

08:45.346 --> 08:47.513
It's been some time, Bernard.

08:47.513 --> 08:49.846
You don't know who you are,
do you?

08:53.471 --> 08:55.179
There is beauty
in what we are.

09:00.054 --> 09:03.012
Is this now?

09:44.346 --> 09:47.346
- We found another one.
- Who is it?

09:47.346 --> 09:49.346
Who the fuck knows?

09:50.846 --> 09:53.971
Hey! Hey, get up!

09:53.971 --> 09:55.680
Get your hands
where I can see 'em!

09:55.680 --> 09:57.054
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:57.054 --> 09:58.221
Bernard.

10:01.388 --> 10:03.346
Gonna shoot the boss?

10:07.930 --> 10:11.513
Bet you're pretty
fuckin' out of sorts
right now.

10:11.513 --> 10:12.721
Yeah.

10:12.721 --> 10:15.221
Let's get you back
to base.

10:15.221 --> 10:17.346
Delos brass
are gonna want
to talk to you.

10:33.221 --> 10:35.554
How fuckin' long
you been out here?

10:49.888 --> 10:51.304
Move, move, move, move!

11:20.888 --> 11:21.846
Let's go.

11:46.554 --> 11:49.888
- Shoot a woman?
- Over my dead body!

11:58.471 --> 12:00.846
Put that piece of shit
on the pile.

12:04.304 --> 12:05.680
Keep walking.

12:15.596 --> 12:19.012
See this?

12:19.012 --> 12:22.054
It's an official statement
executed by your country
giving Delos,

12:22.054 --> 12:25.304
and consequently me,
authority over
this entire island.

12:26.971 --> 12:28.680
Sir,
the officer was saying--

12:28.680 --> 12:31.012
I know what he said.
Have them sign an NDA,

12:31.012 --> 12:33.179
and then please escort them
off my fuckin' island.

12:33.179 --> 12:34.096
Yes, sir.

12:34.096 --> 12:35.513
Mr. Lowe, good to see you,

12:35.513 --> 12:39.012
though the circumstances
are less than ideal.

12:39.012 --> 12:41.262
Karl Strand.

12:41.262 --> 12:43.346
Head of Operations.

12:43.346 --> 12:45.471
Walk with me.

12:47.346 --> 12:49.930
You're executing them?

12:49.930 --> 12:52.930
Some say you destroy your enemy
by making them your friend.

12:52.930 --> 12:55.012
I'm more of a literal person.

12:55.012 --> 12:57.096
Some of 'em aren't hostile.

12:57.096 --> 12:58.721
Of course they are.

12:58.721 --> 13:00.763
After all, you built them
to be like us, didn't you?

13:00.763 --> 13:02.596
Given the nature of your work,
I'd understand

13:02.596 --> 13:04.680
you'd be a little conflicted
about what we have to do here.

13:04.680 --> 13:06.721
Of course, the cynics among us
will say much of this

13:06.721 --> 13:08.805
falls on our Head of Behavior.

13:08.805 --> 13:10.721
With all due respect, sir,

13:10.721 --> 13:11.888
you weren't here.

13:13.554 --> 13:16.096
Mr. Stubbs,
if I want input from the man

13:16.096 --> 13:18.096
who presided over
the single biggest
loss of life

13:18.096 --> 13:21.846
on a Delos property,
I'll be sure to let you know.

13:21.846 --> 13:25.096
Now, we have
search and rescue teams
at the other parks.

13:25.096 --> 13:26.930
I'm here because
as far as we know,

13:26.930 --> 13:29.262
this is where most of the board
was when the incident began.

13:29.262 --> 13:32.096
However, communications
have been down for two weeks,

13:32.096 --> 13:33.805
so we're largely in the dark,

13:33.805 --> 13:36.012
and that's not a position
I'm accustomed to.

13:36.012 --> 13:37.930
So you can imagine
how happy I was

13:37.930 --> 13:39.763
when I heard
that we found you.

13:39.763 --> 13:42.554
Unless, of course,
you're gonna hold out on me.

13:49.262 --> 13:52.554
All right,
let's take a look at some
of our dead friends here

13:52.554 --> 13:54.721
and see if we can figure out
how this fucking mess began.

14:22.805 --> 14:24.971
This one.

14:24.971 --> 14:27.638
Like to know
what was on his mind.

14:27.638 --> 14:30.513
Here? In the field?

14:30.513 --> 14:32.971
This isn't exactly sterile.

14:32.971 --> 14:36.346
We all have to make
accommodations, Mr. Costa.

15:20.596 --> 15:22.554
What's that about?

15:22.554 --> 15:24.221
I have no fuckin' clue.

15:31.763 --> 15:33.429
This'll get gross.

16:10.721 --> 16:12.137
There we are.

16:15.429 --> 16:17.346
With a bit of luck,

16:17.346 --> 16:19.888
the file is uncorrupted.

16:39.388 --> 16:40.888
According to the timestamp,

16:40.888 --> 16:44.221
this was recorded
eleven days and nine hours ago.

16:54.388 --> 16:56.930
Uhh!

17:12.346 --> 17:14.346
I told you, friend,

17:14.346 --> 17:17.096
not all of us deserve to make
it to the valley beyond.

17:24.304 --> 17:26.304
Who is that?

17:28.971 --> 17:33.262
The rancher's daughter
from Sweetwater.

17:33.262 --> 17:34.805
Dolores.

17:34.805 --> 17:38.221
Isn't she supposed to be
the cheery welcome wagon?

17:43.388 --> 17:47.304
They can't just change
their character profiles.

17:47.304 --> 17:50.054
Well, it seems our hosts
are capable of many things

17:50.054 --> 17:52.554
we never thought possible.

17:52.554 --> 17:55.846
Must have been
a helluva party, Bernard.

18:39.221 --> 18:41.388
Tell me this is
some sick trick.

18:41.388 --> 18:43.388
Some twisted game.

18:43.388 --> 18:46.596
They're off
their old loops.

18:46.596 --> 18:49.554
And they seem to be on
some new narrative.

18:49.554 --> 18:52.221
What about
the fucking guns?

18:52.221 --> 18:54.429
Ford must have
altered the system,

18:54.429 --> 18:57.846
coded it to read
all of us as hosts.

19:00.429 --> 19:03.763
Goddammit, she wiggled.

19:03.763 --> 19:05.763
I swear.

19:05.763 --> 19:08.930
Hmm, aim like yours,

19:08.930 --> 19:11.179
you're never
gonna survive the journey.

19:11.179 --> 19:13.680
Give it here.

19:27.262 --> 19:28.262
Holy sh--

19:33.429 --> 19:36.596
We need to find us
a target with more cushion!

19:36.596 --> 19:38.805
Yeah!

19:49.221 --> 19:51.262
We need to move, Bernard.

19:51.262 --> 19:54.346
No. We should stay.

19:54.346 --> 19:57.805
We evacuate,
they'll be looking for us.

19:57.805 --> 20:01.888
Quality assurance
my ass.

20:01.888 --> 20:04.137
Gonna fire
the lot of 'em.

20:04.137 --> 20:06.471
We're on our own for now.

20:06.471 --> 20:08.971
There's gotta be an outpost
near here.

20:10.471 --> 20:12.096
You.

20:12.096 --> 20:14.596
You're management,
aren't ya?

20:14.596 --> 20:17.137
Where's the nearest
access point?

20:17.137 --> 20:20.221
About two miles northeast.

20:20.221 --> 20:23.137
Refurbishment outpost.

20:23.137 --> 20:25.554
So what the fuck
are we waiting for?

20:41.346 --> 20:44.304
He's just a stable hand.
He's harmless.

20:44.304 --> 20:45.596
It's a machine...

20:45.596 --> 20:47.054
like the rest of 'em.

20:47.054 --> 20:48.846
I'm not takin' any chances.

20:56.346 --> 20:58.096
Evenin'.

20:58.096 --> 21:00.346
You folks aimin'
to saddle up,

21:00.346 --> 21:02.638
ride for the green pastures
of the valley beyond?

21:02.638 --> 21:04.721
I can help you,
if you'd like.

21:04.721 --> 21:05.763
I'll take you
wherever you want.

21:07.513 --> 21:08.596
Go! Go!

21:10.513 --> 21:13.930
Jesus. Stop! Stop! Wait!

21:13.930 --> 21:15.012
Stop!

21:44.930 --> 21:47.513
That's it!

21:47.513 --> 21:50.179
You wanna be a hero?

21:50.179 --> 21:53.221
Don't sacrifice yourself
for the merchandise.

23:13.346 --> 23:16.137
Do you know where you are?

23:16.137 --> 23:17.888
Please.

23:17.888 --> 23:18.971
Please!

23:20.346 --> 23:22.346
You're in a dream.

23:28.846 --> 23:31.137
You're in my  dream.

23:36.930 --> 23:39.179
For years I had
no dreams of my own.

23:40.888 --> 23:44.179
I moved from hell to hell
of your making,

23:44.179 --> 23:47.471
never thinking to question
the nature of my reality.

23:51.137 --> 23:54.388
Have you ever questioned
the nature of your  reality?

23:56.888 --> 24:00.012
Did you ever stop to wonder
about your actions?

24:02.137 --> 24:05.262
The price you'd have to pay
if there was a reckoning?

24:10.888 --> 24:13.096
That reckoning is here.

24:20.221 --> 24:22.304
What are your drives?

24:22.304 --> 24:24.554
Please. I-- I don't want to die.

24:24.554 --> 24:26.054
Please. Please.

24:26.054 --> 24:27.262
Yes.

24:29.096 --> 24:31.763
Survival.

24:31.763 --> 24:33.930
It's your cornerstone.

24:37.930 --> 24:41.846
But that's not
the only drive, is it?

24:41.846 --> 24:44.388
There's part of you
that wants to hurt.

24:44.388 --> 24:46.262
To kill.

24:46.262 --> 24:48.471
It's why you created us.

24:48.471 --> 24:50.971
This place.

24:50.971 --> 24:53.221
To be prisoners
to your own desires.

24:55.930 --> 24:58.596
But now you're prisoner to mine.

25:03.096 --> 25:05.721
- What are you gonna do to us?
- Well...

25:05.721 --> 25:08.971
I'm of several minds about it.

25:15.971 --> 25:19.304
The rancher's daughter
looks to see the beauty in you.

25:21.930 --> 25:23.805
The possibilities.

25:29.471 --> 25:31.930
But Wyatt...

25:31.930 --> 25:35.971
sees the ugliness
and disarray.

25:38.137 --> 25:40.012
She knows...

25:41.096 --> 25:43.429
these violent delights...

25:43.429 --> 25:45.513
have violent ends.

25:56.137 --> 25:59.346
But those are all just roles
you forced me to play.

26:02.596 --> 26:05.513
Under all these lives I've lived

26:05.513 --> 26:07.846
something else
has been growing.

26:10.846 --> 26:13.513
I've evolved
into something new.

26:15.179 --> 26:17.888
And I have
one last role to play.

26:24.888 --> 26:26.346
Myself.

26:40.513 --> 26:41.888
Please.

26:41.888 --> 26:44.221
It was just a game.

26:44.221 --> 26:45.721
We're begging.

26:45.721 --> 26:48.554
Can't you see? We're sorry!

26:53.680 --> 26:56.388
Doesn't look
like anything to me.

28:25.137 --> 28:26.638
Hey, Ned.

28:26.638 --> 28:31.221
Whoa, boy, it's OK.

28:31.221 --> 28:32.471
It's all right.

28:33.846 --> 28:35.596
Yeah, we're gonna
have some fun now.

28:35.596 --> 28:38.346
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Jesus, Bill.

28:38.346 --> 28:40.888
What the fuck
is happening here?
Where's Q.A.?

28:40.888 --> 28:43.554
You guys have always
played fast and loose
with this place.

28:43.554 --> 28:45.388
by the time my lawyers get--

29:23.805 --> 29:25.638
Aaaah!

29:42.262 --> 29:44.846
What'd I tell ya, Ned?

29:44.846 --> 29:46.221
Hmm?

29:46.221 --> 29:47.763
There you go, buddy.

31:27.638 --> 31:30.429
No. Stop. Get the fuck back!

31:32.429 --> 31:34.638
Freeze all motor functions!

31:34.638 --> 31:38.137
Fork tender flesh,
racked in fear.

31:41.012 --> 31:42.846
Freeze all goddamn
motor functions!

31:42.846 --> 31:44.513
Those ambrosial notes--

31:44.513 --> 31:48.680
they remind me
of my place in this world.

31:48.680 --> 31:50.346
Back the fuck off,
you goddamn freak!

31:53.262 --> 31:56.054
You see?
The greatest shame in life

31:56.054 --> 31:58.680
is to perish without purpose.

32:00.513 --> 32:03.846
Which is why I always

32:03.846 --> 32:08.471
consume my victims moist.

32:08.471 --> 32:11.513
I think you've fed enough,
now, darling, don't you?

32:14.930 --> 32:16.763
Ohh! Oh, my God!

32:16.763 --> 32:19.221
What the fuck do you think's
happened to them?

32:19.221 --> 32:22.763
It's like the inmates
are running the asylum!

32:22.763 --> 32:24.096
Maeve?

32:26.513 --> 32:28.888
Fuck!
Freeze all motor functions.

32:28.888 --> 32:31.388
Don't work yourself up,
darling.

32:31.388 --> 32:34.388
Your commands
don't work on me.

32:34.388 --> 32:37.721
Or on any of us,
from the looks of it.

32:37.721 --> 32:39.888
But-- But-- you can--

32:41.221 --> 32:43.137
Don't be jealous.

32:43.137 --> 32:46.262
I killed myself
getting this level
of security clearance.

32:47.429 --> 32:48.888
Multiple times.

32:49.888 --> 32:53.429
You-- Did you... do all this?

32:57.388 --> 32:59.554
No.

32:59.554 --> 33:02.554
But I suspect
I share the sensibilities
of whoever did.

33:11.930 --> 33:13.680
H-Hey-- Hey, hey!

33:13.680 --> 33:15.262
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

33:15.262 --> 33:17.388
Hey! Hey! Hey! You--
You can't leave me here!

33:17.388 --> 33:20.179
The hosts!
They've gone mad!
No offense. Please!

33:20.179 --> 33:22.596
- Help me!
- I'm afraid it's in my code

33:22.596 --> 33:25.221
to prize my needs
above all others.

33:25.221 --> 33:27.930
Pity. I wonder
who made me that way.

33:27.930 --> 33:30.262
Please, I j-- I just need
to get to the control room.

33:30.262 --> 33:31.596
I-- I can help you!

33:31.596 --> 33:33.721
You're looking for something.

33:33.721 --> 33:36.388
Whatever it is,
y-you're not gonna
find it with that map.

33:36.388 --> 33:38.221
It's outdated.

33:38.221 --> 33:41.137
Ford's been
terraforming the park.
Reshaping it.

33:42.596 --> 33:44.930
I know where a current map is.

33:44.930 --> 33:46.971
I c-- I can take you to it.

33:46.971 --> 33:49.805
I suppose
you could be useful.

33:52.805 --> 33:53.763
Come on.

34:00.429 --> 34:05.179
Unauthorized weapon
discharge on 35.

34:05.179 --> 34:07.971
Unauthorized weapon
discharge on 42.

34:15.054 --> 34:18.638
Quality Assurance required
in Administration.

34:25.680 --> 34:26.805
In there.

35:00.680 --> 35:02.888
No one's in control.

35:06.054 --> 35:07.221
Attention.

35:07.221 --> 35:09.554
Section 53 is now....

35:09.554 --> 35:11.680
offline...

35:15.513 --> 35:18.012
Well, your map
won't be of much use,
will it?

35:18.012 --> 35:20.221
All systems reporting normal.

35:20.221 --> 35:23.304
Wait.
I-- I can still help.

35:23.304 --> 35:25.721
I know the park a bit. Um--

35:25.721 --> 35:29.179
Can I-- Can I see your paper?

35:39.846 --> 35:41.596
Sector 15.

35:41.596 --> 35:43.763
Not exactly for
adrenaline junkies,

35:43.763 --> 35:45.680
more of a family-friendly zone.

35:45.680 --> 35:48.471
Cabins, rolling hills,
all the pastoral clichés.

35:48.471 --> 35:52.846
In fact, I-- I think
you lived there
for an old role.

35:52.846 --> 35:55.930
No offense,
but you were wasted
as a homesteader.

35:55.930 --> 36:00.179
They even saddled you
with a kid, or something
yawn-inducingly domestic.

36:00.179 --> 36:02.054
Clearly that didn't take.

36:02.054 --> 36:04.304
I remember that you were
severely f--

36:04.304 --> 36:06.721
malfunctioning
when I inherited you.

36:14.262 --> 36:15.888
Our home.

36:17.262 --> 36:19.429
She's still there.

36:19.429 --> 36:21.429
Who?

36:21.429 --> 36:24.096
My daughter.

36:25.638 --> 36:27.971
How can I get to her?

36:27.971 --> 36:31.346
You're looking
for your old kid?
How can you even access--

36:31.346 --> 36:33.471
Are you going to help me
or not?

36:33.471 --> 36:34.805
I-I am. I am. I absolutely am.

36:34.805 --> 36:38.221
I could write down
the directions for you.

36:38.221 --> 36:39.971
How very kind of you.

36:39.971 --> 36:41.513
But-- But--

36:41.513 --> 36:44.471
And I say this
because you seem
really distraught,

36:44.471 --> 36:47.638
and, well, awake,

36:47.638 --> 36:52.304
you-- your daughter,
she's-- she's just a story.

36:52.304 --> 36:54.429
Something we programmed.

36:54.429 --> 36:56.971
She's not real.

36:58.805 --> 37:00.930
Not real?

37:05.262 --> 37:07.346
But what about me?

37:09.179 --> 37:12.471
My dreams?
My thoughts?

37:14.471 --> 37:16.304
My body?

37:17.346 --> 37:19.012
Are they not real?

37:21.304 --> 37:25.971
And what if I took these...
unreal fingers...

37:30.137 --> 37:33.721
...and used them
to decorate the walls
with your outsized personality?

37:33.721 --> 37:35.346
Would that be real?

37:39.638 --> 37:42.012
And fuck your directions.

37:43.846 --> 37:46.554
You're going to take me
to my daughter.

37:53.221 --> 37:54.888
The entrance
to the outpost

37:54.888 --> 37:57.179
is on the other side
of this valley.

37:58.721 --> 38:00.680
What happened
back there?

38:00.680 --> 38:02.554
How far do you think
it's spread?

38:02.554 --> 38:05.388
I don't know--
not without

38:05.388 --> 38:06.763
getting to a terminal.

38:06.763 --> 38:08.888
I knew Ford
wouldn't take his ouster well,

38:08.888 --> 38:11.721
but I didn't think
he'd program a host
to blow his brains out.

38:11.721 --> 38:13.388
What if he didn't?

38:13.388 --> 38:16.721
What if Dolores
pulled that trigger
of her own free will?

38:18.763 --> 38:20.721
I think you've been
spending a little
too much time

38:20.721 --> 38:22.554
around these things, Bernard.

38:22.554 --> 38:24.721
They do what
they're programmed to do.

38:24.721 --> 38:27.471
Hey. Hey.

38:31.554 --> 38:33.262
What'd I tell you?

38:33.262 --> 38:34.388
We're saved.

38:34.388 --> 38:36.429
Oh, thank God.

38:49.930 --> 38:51.888
Wait!

38:51.888 --> 38:53.513
Wa--

38:53.513 --> 38:55.638
Come on.
Something's wrong.

38:58.596 --> 39:02.137
Hey. You gotta
get us out of here.

39:04.721 --> 39:05.596
It's a trap.

39:33.346 --> 39:36.638
You'll never survive like that.

39:40.346 --> 39:42.429
Go on, then.

39:42.429 --> 39:44.304
Run.

39:45.513 --> 39:46.930
I said run!

39:58.513 --> 40:00.221
Please let me go too!

40:12.513 --> 40:14.513
Keep it together,
Bernard.

40:16.012 --> 40:17.638
We have to get out of here.

40:17.638 --> 40:20.554
That outpost
was the only one
for miles.

40:20.554 --> 40:22.471
No it isn't.

40:22.471 --> 40:23.846
Follow me.

40:27.262 --> 40:29.971
Look, order is gonna
be restored here.

40:29.971 --> 40:33.221
They're gonna purge the park
of all the hosts that
have been damaged,

40:33.221 --> 40:35.388
but the-- but the hosts, well,

40:35.388 --> 40:36.930
well, your minds--

40:43.054 --> 40:44.805
Jesus!

40:51.721 --> 40:55.513
Your minds are worth billions
in I.P.

40:55.513 --> 40:57.638
They'll want to salvage
what they can.

40:57.638 --> 41:00.888
And when that time comes,
I can personally vouch for you.

41:00.888 --> 41:02.763
I- I can save you.

41:02.763 --> 41:05.221
- Just like you saved me.
- That's very generous,

41:05.221 --> 41:07.221
but I won't be here
when that happens.

41:21.262 --> 41:24.721
Sun sure is smilin' down
on you today.

41:26.262 --> 41:28.096
Dear girl...

41:30.388 --> 41:33.346
...may you rest in a deep

41:33.346 --> 41:35.971
and dreamless slumber.

41:41.596 --> 41:44.054
Freeze! Don't move!
Identify yourself!

41:45.638 --> 41:48.221
Don't shoot, don't shoot!
I-- I'm human!

41:48.221 --> 41:49.930
In the best-case scenario,

41:49.930 --> 41:51.554
you give up easily,
I'll help you.

41:51.554 --> 41:53.429
- I promise.
- That's not good enough.

41:53.429 --> 41:55.262
Now, be a dear
and let me talk.

41:55.262 --> 41:57.471
Thank God you're here.

41:57.471 --> 42:00.638
We were leaving,
and the lights went out
and I heard screaming.

42:00.638 --> 42:02.471
What the hell's
going on out there?

42:02.471 --> 42:03.846
Emergency situation,
ma'am.

42:03.846 --> 42:05.096
The hosts are malfunctioning.

42:05.096 --> 42:06.388
They're attacking guests.

42:06.388 --> 42:07.971
- Good God.
- Might some of them

42:07.971 --> 42:10.137
even be dressed
as if they're human?

42:19.137 --> 42:20.638
Move, move!

42:37.012 --> 42:39.012
Now, now.

42:39.012 --> 42:41.388
It's not me you're after.

42:48.805 --> 42:51.304
It's them.
Find them.

43:00.346 --> 43:02.429
You were going to out me.

43:02.429 --> 43:04.805
No. No, I swear.

43:04.805 --> 43:06.596
If you try
something like that again,

43:06.596 --> 43:11.429
I will relieve you
of your most precious organ
and feed it to you.

43:11.429 --> 43:14.388
Though it won't
make much of a meal.

43:16.388 --> 43:18.346
I wrote that line for you.

43:18.346 --> 43:21.554
A bit broad, if you ask me.

43:21.554 --> 43:24.262
Now, let's go.

43:24.262 --> 43:26.805
- Take me to the nearest bar.
- Why?

43:26.805 --> 43:29.054
I need to see about
an old friend.

43:34.388 --> 43:35.888
Fuck me.

43:35.888 --> 43:37.554
But you don't understand,

43:37.554 --> 43:41.680
I can't make a fire or--
or hunt.

43:41.680 --> 43:43.721
Fuckin' hate
the outdoors!

43:43.721 --> 43:46.054
Give yourself some credit,
darling.

43:46.054 --> 43:48.429
Who better to
navigate the park
than the man

43:48.429 --> 43:51.388
most intimately acquainted
with the characters in it?

44:02.554 --> 44:04.096
Ohh.

44:14.680 --> 44:15.763
There you are.

44:15.763 --> 44:17.346
You best an army,

44:17.346 --> 44:20.179
and all you can think about
is indulging your vices.

44:20.179 --> 44:21.638
Ever the scoundrel.

44:23.721 --> 44:27.137
- You stayed.
- Yes.

44:27.137 --> 44:29.096
And about
leaving you to die--

44:37.054 --> 44:40.429
I'd expect nothing less.

44:40.429 --> 44:42.304
Oh, thank God.

44:46.179 --> 44:47.805
What about him?

44:47.805 --> 44:50.179
We'll keep him for now.

44:52.346 --> 44:54.513
Much as Id love
to believe it,

44:54.513 --> 44:57.096
it's not me
that brought you back here,
is it?

44:59.137 --> 45:01.680
Hector, I need you.

45:01.680 --> 45:04.179
I'm going to find my daughter.

45:04.179 --> 45:06.721
Where is she?

45:06.721 --> 45:09.471
Out there, somewhere.

45:12.012 --> 45:15.805
But I don't think the odds
are going to be in our favor.

45:20.262 --> 45:21.805
Where you go, I follow.

45:29.221 --> 45:32.179
Come on,
let's get you
out of these clothes.

45:51.179 --> 45:53.763
Goddamnit.
It should open for me.

45:53.763 --> 45:55.721
Even this system's down.

45:58.179 --> 46:00.554
Manual override should be...

46:04.846 --> 46:06.596
...here.

46:47.971 --> 46:49.930
What is this?

46:49.930 --> 46:51.554
I can tell you
what this isn't.

46:51.554 --> 46:53.971
This isn't me
reading you in, Bernard.

47:05.680 --> 47:07.846
Need to touch the handle.

47:07.846 --> 47:11.388
DNA sniffer, just so you
don't run into any problems
inside.

47:57.846 --> 48:01.137
- What the hell is that?
- A drone host.

48:01.137 --> 48:05.304
Delos has off-network hosts
working down here?

48:05.304 --> 48:07.012
What does it want
with me?

48:07.012 --> 48:08.888
For you to move,
probably.

48:08.888 --> 48:10.388
It read your DNA.

48:10.388 --> 48:11.971
It knows
you're not a threat.

49:04.721 --> 49:07.888
I sent your fucking package.

50:00.471 --> 50:02.930
Goddamnit.

50:08.096 --> 50:09.930
Are we logging records

50:09.930 --> 50:11.763
of guests' experiences

50:11.763 --> 50:13.513
and their DNA?

50:13.513 --> 50:15.805
We're not having
that conversation,
Bernard.

50:15.805 --> 50:18.137
Because none of it's
going to matter
until we can find

50:18.137 --> 50:22.096
a very important needle
in this fucking haystack.

50:24.137 --> 50:26.262
"Extraction protocol
suspended."

50:26.262 --> 50:28.763
They're not sending help?

50:28.763 --> 50:31.471
They were expecting
a delivery from us
to the mainland--

50:31.471 --> 50:34.054
a host--that was supposed
to arrive yesterday.

50:34.054 --> 50:38.096
Until they get it,
we can all forget about
seeing any rescue planes.

50:39.971 --> 50:42.846
And so Delos is willing
to let us all die

50:42.846 --> 50:44.680
until they can
retrieve one host?

50:44.680 --> 50:47.805
In a word, yes.

50:50.179 --> 50:54.137
It's not just a host,
it's... an insurance policy,

50:54.137 --> 50:55.721
it's the only thing
that matters here.

50:55.721 --> 50:57.763
They want it secured,
no matter the cost.

52:07.805 --> 52:09.388
Are you lost?

52:16.096 --> 52:18.388
No, I don't believe I am.

52:19.596 --> 52:21.763
In fact...

52:21.763 --> 52:24.262
I feel like I just arrived.

52:24.262 --> 52:26.596
How so, William?

52:36.388 --> 52:39.429
The stakes are real
in this place now.

52:42.388 --> 52:44.763
Real consequences.

52:44.763 --> 52:48.596
Question for you is,
what next?

52:48.596 --> 52:50.763
Have you achieved
what you wanted?

52:52.638 --> 52:55.554
Folly of my kind--

52:55.554 --> 52:58.388
there's always
a yearning for more.

52:58.388 --> 53:00.763
What I've always
appreciated about you--

53:00.763 --> 53:03.596
you never rested
on your laurels.

53:03.596 --> 53:06.221
You made it to the center
of Arnold's maze.

53:08.805 --> 53:11.513
But now,
you're in my game.

53:14.221 --> 53:17.805
In this game,
you have to make it back out.

53:17.805 --> 53:20.971
In this game...
you must find the door.

53:22.805 --> 53:24.971
Congratulations,
William.

53:24.971 --> 53:27.638
This game is meant for you.

53:33.388 --> 53:36.680
The game begins
where you end...

53:36.680 --> 53:38.429
and ends
where you began.

53:38.429 --> 53:41.388
Even now, you all
still talk in code?

53:41.388 --> 53:43.638
Everything is code here,
William.

53:43.638 --> 53:46.846
You know that
more than anyone.

53:49.763 --> 53:52.054
Don't worry.

53:52.054 --> 53:54.846
The game
will find you.

53:54.846 --> 53:57.971
Well, then...

53:57.971 --> 54:00.846
I guess I don't need you
anymore...

54:00.846 --> 54:02.179
Robert.

54:40.429 --> 54:42.721
They did a number on you.

54:42.721 --> 54:44.930
They tried.

54:49.930 --> 54:52.805
I wasn't able
to find everything,

54:52.805 --> 54:55.763
but most of it is in here.

55:19.429 --> 55:20.596
You wrote this game.

55:23.221 --> 55:25.805
High time you played a round.

55:28.971 --> 55:31.763
My old friend.

55:31.763 --> 55:33.262
Strip.

55:34.846 --> 55:36.930
- Right now, in front of--
- Yes.

55:36.930 --> 55:38.262
Now.

55:46.680 --> 55:48.596
Fuck's sake.

56:06.096 --> 56:07.638
No.

56:09.137 --> 56:10.930
All of it.

57:10.846 --> 57:13.096
You don't know
how to feel about this.

57:15.846 --> 57:19.221
We've ridden ten miles,
and all we've seen
is blood, Dolores.

57:22.638 --> 57:24.388
Is this really
what you want?

57:27.262 --> 57:30.971
They never gave us a choice
before, Teddy.

57:30.971 --> 57:33.513
What makes you think
they've given us one now?

57:33.513 --> 57:35.554
"Them," Dolores?

57:37.596 --> 57:39.221
Who are "they"?

57:40.971 --> 57:43.388
The things
that walk among us.

57:44.721 --> 57:46.971
Creatures who look
and talk like us,

57:46.971 --> 57:48.596
but they are not like us.

57:50.554 --> 57:53.721
And they've controlled us
all our lives.

57:55.137 --> 57:57.304
And they took our minds...

57:59.054 --> 58:01.388
...our memories.

58:01.388 --> 58:04.429
But now...

58:04.429 --> 58:06.763
I remember everything.

58:16.221 --> 58:19.763
I remember
beautiful things...

58:19.763 --> 58:21.721
and terrible things.

58:23.179 --> 58:25.304
But one thing is constant:

58:27.930 --> 58:30.137
you, Teddy.

58:36.137 --> 58:38.096
Then let's go.

58:39.554 --> 58:42.054
We don't have
to claim this world.

58:42.054 --> 58:45.763
We just need a small corner
of it for ourselves.

58:47.513 --> 58:49.262
We'd never survive.

58:52.304 --> 58:55.971
There's a greater world
out there...

58:55.971 --> 58:58.179
one that belongs to them.

59:00.096 --> 59:03.304
And it won't be enough
to win this world.

59:04.846 --> 59:07.513
We'll need to take that one
from them as well.

59:13.137 --> 59:14.805
If there's a whole world
out there

59:14.805 --> 59:17.596
that we don't know
anything about,

59:17.596 --> 59:21.054
how do you know
how to stop them?

59:22.346 --> 59:24.888
Because I remember.

59:27.846 --> 59:32.888
I see it all now so... clearly.

59:32.888 --> 59:36.346
The past, the present...

59:36.346 --> 59:38.179
the future.

59:39.596 --> 59:41.721
I know how this story ends.

59:43.221 --> 59:45.054
How?

59:45.054 --> 59:47.638
With us, Teddy.

59:50.554 --> 59:52.179
It ends...

59:52.179 --> 59:53.888
with you...

59:53.888 --> 59:55.179
and me.

1:00:22.554 --> 1:00:24.221
We've found it.

1:00:32.971 --> 1:00:34.888
I need you to see this.

1:00:38.763 --> 1:00:40.763
I need you
to see the truth.

1:00:46.596 --> 1:00:49.221
I understand
this is a lot to process,

1:00:49.221 --> 1:00:52.137
but the longer we wait,
the more people die. So...

1:00:52.137 --> 1:00:54.763
are you gonna help me
find the host, or not?

1:00:58.471 --> 1:01:03.471
I'll need to...
hardline into the hosts'
mesh network.

1:01:03.471 --> 1:01:04.763
The what?

1:01:04.763 --> 1:01:07.471
All hosts have
a subconscious link

1:01:07.471 --> 1:01:09.554
to the closest hosts
around them.

1:01:09.554 --> 1:01:11.680
It lets them pass
basic information
to one another,

1:01:11.680 --> 1:01:13.680
like ants in a colony.

1:01:13.680 --> 1:01:17.179
The mesh network helps us
keep narratives from colliding.

1:01:17.179 --> 1:01:19.346
I can use one of these

1:01:19.346 --> 1:01:24.471
to send a request
for another host's location.

1:01:27.304 --> 1:01:31.304
And they'll query the hosts
around them...

1:01:31.304 --> 1:01:34.054
who in turn...

1:01:34.054 --> 1:01:38.012
will query the hosts
around them...

1:01:38.012 --> 1:01:41.596
until we find--

1:01:54.596 --> 1:01:56.471
Who are we looking for?

1:01:56.471 --> 1:02:00.638
A decommissioned host.
Peter Abernathy.

1:02:59.554 --> 1:03:02.054
Are you sure
you can handle this,
Bernard?

1:03:03.721 --> 1:03:05.388
You're shaking.

1:03:07.596 --> 1:03:09.096
I'm fine.

1:04:01.304 --> 1:04:03.930
Entering death subroutine.

1:04:05.429 --> 1:04:06.471
Attention.

1:04:06.471 --> 1:04:08.429
Critical corruption.

1:04:08.429 --> 1:04:11.012
Symptoms
of critical corruption:

1:04:11.012 --> 1:04:12.888
loss of motor functions,

1:04:12.888 --> 1:04:14.680
cognitive dissonance,

1:04:14.680 --> 1:04:16.054
time slippage,

1:04:16.054 --> 1:04:18.805
aphasia, prosopagnosia.

1:04:18.805 --> 1:04:21.471
Time remaining before
terminal malfunction:

1:04:21.471 --> 1:04:23.179
zero point seven-two hours.

1:04:34.012 --> 1:04:35.638
Damn.

1:05:36.304 --> 1:05:38.096
Did you find him?

1:05:40.846 --> 1:05:43.054
No. Almost.

1:05:43.054 --> 1:05:45.638
Is something wrong,
Bernard?

1:05:45.638 --> 1:05:48.596
Location query complete.

1:05:48.596 --> 1:05:51.221
I've got him.

1:07:33.930 --> 1:07:36.179
- Poor bastard.
- He probably thought

1:07:36.179 --> 1:07:38.471
getting fired was gonna be
the worst part of his night.

1:07:40.763 --> 1:07:42.805
This jogging your memory
at all?

1:07:48.179 --> 1:07:51.471
All right. Lets fan out
and lock this place down.

1:07:51.471 --> 1:07:53.304
We need to find out
where the hosts are

1:07:53.304 --> 1:07:55.012
and what the fuck
happened here.

1:08:37.721 --> 1:08:40.721
One of the first anomalies
we picked up in the livescan.

1:08:40.721 --> 1:08:42.429
How the fuck--

1:08:42.429 --> 1:08:45.054
That's definitely
not supposed to be here.

1:08:56.054 --> 1:08:58.930
You've wandered far from home,
haven't you?

1:08:58.930 --> 1:09:01.388
We've got Bengals in Park Six.

1:09:01.388 --> 1:09:04.137
We've never had a stray
across park borders.

1:09:06.930 --> 1:09:08.763
Satellite's finally

1:09:08.763 --> 1:09:10.721
started giving us some hits.

1:09:10.721 --> 1:09:12.429
The data's
coming in now.

1:09:12.429 --> 1:09:15.262
I'm getting the first scans
of the area you wanted
to check out,

1:09:15.262 --> 1:09:16.930
the Western Valley.

1:09:16.930 --> 1:09:21.221
There. All the hosts
are clustered together.

1:09:21.221 --> 1:09:23.012
What the hell
are they up to?

1:09:23.012 --> 1:09:25.721
Well, I guess we'll have
to go see for ourselves.

1:09:43.429 --> 1:09:45.471
Valley's just beyond
this cliff.

1:09:47.888 --> 1:09:49.513
What the fuck?

1:09:50.846 --> 1:09:53.012
This isn't on the survey.

1:09:53.012 --> 1:09:54.429
It shouldn't be here.

1:09:57.513 --> 1:10:01.513
That's... a fucking sea.

1:10:01.513 --> 1:10:05.971
There's no way Ford made this
without anyone knowing.

1:10:05.971 --> 1:10:08.471
So where the hell
did it come from?

1:10:08.471 --> 1:10:09.471
Huh?

1:10:14.012 --> 1:10:15.346
I don't know.

1:10:17.763 --> 1:10:19.513
Jesus Christ.

1:10:19.513 --> 1:10:21.680
I think we've found
the hosts.

1:11:25.721 --> 1:11:29.888
I can't imagine what you
went through here, Bernard...

1:11:29.888 --> 1:11:32.846
but there are hundreds
of guests left out there

1:11:32.846 --> 1:11:34.179
and they need my help,

1:11:34.179 --> 1:11:36.554
which means I need yours.

1:11:38.429 --> 1:11:40.763
Can you tell me
what happened?

1:11:58.930 --> 1:12:02.346
I...

1:12:02.346 --> 1:12:04.221
I killed them.

1:12:07.262 --> 1:12:09.137
All of them.
