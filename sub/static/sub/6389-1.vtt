09:22.801 --> 09:25.739
Okay.

09:25.772 --> 09:28.581
You guys gotta get this
shit in perspective, okay?

09:28.614 --> 09:29.709
[Groans]

09:29.742 --> 09:30.950
I came back for the love of my life

09:30.983 --> 09:32.317
and she rejected me,

09:32.350 --> 09:33.813
which bums me out on many levels.

09:33.853 --> 09:35.853
Not the least of which
is that you fucktards

09:35.886 --> 09:38.189
got your shit together before we did.

09:38.222 --> 09:40.853
Now you, you're letting
your pasty white cone head

09:40.894 --> 09:42.525
get in the way of the prime directive.

09:42.558 --> 09:44.661
Yours is not the reason why.

09:44.694 --> 09:46.964
Yours is to seek and destroy
her shimmering snatch.

09:46.997 --> 09:49.099
Don't be fuckin' with her elf-esteem.

09:49.132 --> 09:51.666
Aw, thanks, Hanky.

09:51.699 --> 09:53.362
And she's got the magic vagina.

09:53.402 --> 09:54.602
You know you want it.

09:54.635 --> 09:55.836
I do want it.

09:55.869 --> 09:58.172
I'm gonna fuck your face off, Marcy.

09:58.205 --> 09:59.573
All right. All right.

09:59.606 --> 10:01.213
You're gonna fuckin'
be seeing fuckin' stars.

10:01.246 --> 10:02.780
- One step at a time.
- I'm gonna fuck you.

10:02.814 --> 10:04.843
Let's see if we can get some blood flowin'

10:04.876 --> 10:07.577
to that thin, bent wang of yours...

10:07.610 --> 10:09.176
- [Growls]
- Yes, baby.

10:09.217 --> 10:11.812
Wait... Hank, stay.

10:11.844 --> 10:13.546
You're not coming.

10:13.579 --> 10:16.220
- [Pounding on door]
- [Groans]

10:16.253 --> 10:19.117
Whaaat...

10:19.158 --> 10:21.293
can I do for you?

10:21.326 --> 10:22.925
Settle down, dude. Are you Charlie Runkle?

10:22.958 --> 10:24.924
Who's askin'?

10:24.957 --> 10:27.026
My name's Levon. I've been
emailing you about Hank moody.

10:27.059 --> 10:28.928
I want to interview him.

10:28.961 --> 10:29.960
I don't know what you're talking about.

10:29.993 --> 10:31.959
I sent you, like, 20 emails.

10:31.992 --> 10:34.998
Wh... Why are you here? Who...
Who told you where I live?

10:35.031 --> 10:37.427
The Internet told me. You
got a pretty retarded name.

10:37.460 --> 10:38.594
Do you know how many Charlie Runkles

10:38.628 --> 10:39.898
there aren't in Los Angeles?

10:39.931 --> 10:42.632
- You got the wrong Runkle, kid.
- You're lying.

10:42.665 --> 10:45.364
- [Phone beeps]
- That's you.

10:45.397 --> 10:47.763
You're the masturbating agent.

10:47.796 --> 10:50.698
Look, whatever. If Hank's
into it, I'll be in touch.

10:50.731 --> 10:51.937
No, come on, man, can I meet him?

10:51.970 --> 10:54.936
- No! No, that's impossible.
- Please.

10:54.969 --> 10:55.969
What's the racket?

10:56.002 --> 10:58.107
How the fuck a brother supposed to get

10:58.140 --> 10:59.476
- some beauty sleep around here?
- That's him.

10:59.509 --> 11:01.276
- Y-you're him.
- Who?

11:01.316 --> 11:02.412
You're Hank Moody.

11:02.445 --> 11:05.150
Hank Moody I must be. Who you be?

11:05.183 --> 11:06.655
This would be Levon.

11:06.688 --> 11:07.992
He's the kid I've been telling you about.

11:08.025 --> 11:10.391
He wants to interview you
for his college newspaper.

11:10.424 --> 11:11.823
What the fuck, Runks? I
didn't tell you to set that up.

11:11.864 --> 11:14.097
You lying, fucking masturbating asshole.

11:14.130 --> 11:15.972
You did get my emails.

11:16.005 --> 11:18.668
I like this kid. Levon,
huh? That's pretty groovy.

11:18.709 --> 11:19.972
Your parents big Elton John fans?

11:20.005 --> 11:22.981
- My mother.
- Must have good taste.

11:23.014 --> 11:25.178
- That's debatable.
- [Phone rings]

11:25.211 --> 11:27.480
Hey, look, are you okay
with whatever this is?

11:27.513 --> 11:29.145
Yeah, it's fine.

11:29.179 --> 11:31.186
Come on in.

11:31.219 --> 11:32.650
Levon, you got 15 minutes.

11:32.683 --> 11:34.522
I want you out of here before I wake up.

11:34.555 --> 11:35.689
Now, what do you want to talk about?

11:35.722 --> 11:36.986
Okay, uh, right.

11:37.020 --> 11:39.427
So, uh, where were you born?

11:39.460 --> 11:40.795
Oh, you want to go way back.

11:40.827 --> 11:42.626
I was born and bred in the Bronx,

11:42.659 --> 11:43.857
but my parents moved to raise me

11:43.898 --> 11:45.530
like veal on the island of long,

11:45.563 --> 11:47.837
which ultimately inspired me to escape

11:47.870 --> 11:50.342
back to the big, bad wilds of the city

11:50.375 --> 11:52.277
as soon as I was vaguely able.

11:52.310 --> 11:54.173
How many girlfriends have you had?

11:54.206 --> 11:55.710
Uh, a few?

11:55.743 --> 11:59.015
Uh, how many significant relationships?

11:59.048 --> 12:01.655
What, you writing my obituary?

12:01.688 --> 12:04.222
Do you consider yourself a misogynist?

12:04.255 --> 12:08.129
Not really. I mean, I'm
a big fan of "Womaninity".

12:08.162 --> 12:12.463
I like it all... Y'know.
Big, fat, tall, short, small,

12:12.496 --> 12:15.138
white, black, yellow,
purple... Big fan of lady-ness.

12:15.171 --> 12:16.739
I thought you wanted to
talk about my writing.

12:16.772 --> 12:19.972
- I've read your books.
- And?

12:20.013 --> 12:22.012
Do you have any children?

12:22.045 --> 12:23.180
Yeah, one, a daughter.

12:23.213 --> 12:27.215
Okay. Does she think that
you are a good father?

12:27.256 --> 12:28.752
I'm sure she has issues with the old man.

12:28.793 --> 12:31.861
Do you think that you're
a good interviewer?

12:31.894 --> 12:33.828
How many hearts have
you broken in your life?

12:33.860 --> 12:36.099
Hey, kid, do you have a problem with me?

12:36.132 --> 12:38.132
Did I fuck your girlfriend or something?

12:38.173 --> 12:40.340
Hank! Hank, you were right!

12:40.373 --> 12:41.707
A new day has dawned,

12:41.740 --> 12:43.138
and the opportunity has presented itself.

12:43.171 --> 12:45.305
Come on, change your clothes.
We got ourselves a meeting.

12:45.338 --> 12:47.146
- Where? Where?
- I'll tell you on the way.

12:47.179 --> 12:48.475
Come on, let's go. You, kid, outta here.

12:48.516 --> 12:49.548
- Wait...
- Just...

12:49.581 --> 12:51.382
Can I... Can I come with you guys?

12:51.415 --> 12:52.455
It might be good for the article.

12:52.488 --> 12:54.592
You know what? We'll "re-shedule."

12:54.625 --> 12:57.290
Really great start today!

12:57.331 --> 12:59.130
Bye.

12:59.163 --> 13:00.329
[Laughs]

13:00.362 --> 13:02.999
[Stage bell rings]

13:03.032 --> 13:05.367
Just don't come off as one of those

13:05.400 --> 13:08.072
snotty, pretentious fucks
who looks down on television.

13:08.105 --> 13:11.410
- Me? Never.
- How is it?

13:11.443 --> 13:13.411
To be honest, it's like
a colonoscopy of the mind.

13:13.444 --> 13:14.980
Hank.

13:15.013 --> 13:17.485
But if he asks, I will tell
him it's "Totes fuckin' brill."

13:17.518 --> 13:19.517
I will be my absolute best self in there.

13:19.550 --> 13:22.587
Good boy. It's weird seeing you like this.

13:22.620 --> 13:24.551
- All driven and shit.
- [Laughs]

13:29.558 --> 13:31.590
Funny how these things
come full circle, huh?

13:31.624 --> 13:34.493
When people are truly connected

13:34.526 --> 13:38.030
they can never truly escape each other.

13:38.063 --> 13:39.765
Speaking of which, how's Marcy?

13:39.798 --> 13:42.164
Good. Great.

13:42.197 --> 13:44.269
Yeah. Just back from
the honeymoon, actually.

13:44.302 --> 13:45.269
Ah.

13:45.302 --> 13:47.876
Gosh, Runkle, you really know

13:47.909 --> 13:49.372
how to kick a guy when he's down.

13:49.406 --> 13:53.616
I know exactly what that
woman is like on a honeymoon.

13:53.649 --> 13:57.887
Our magnificent sex organs
were fused ten days straight.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.485
I couldn't stand not being inside of her.

14:00.518 --> 14:03.124
I walked around the hotel
room and... [Snaps] Boom.

14:03.157 --> 14:04.123
Right there on my jock.

14:04.156 --> 14:06.724
Steady, Runks.

14:06.757 --> 14:09.326
Hey kid, nice to see you. How you doing?

14:09.367 --> 14:11.366
Oh, I'm great, Moody.

14:11.399 --> 14:13.962
<i>Last we met, I was directing
Santa Monica Cop the movie,</i>

14:13.995 --> 14:15.634
now I'm peripherally involved

14:15.667 --> 14:18.598
<i>with Santa Monica Cop the TV show.</i>

14:18.631 --> 14:20.429
So things are going really
well for me. Thanks for asking.

14:20.462 --> 14:21.967
Shit. What the fuck happened?
Where'd you go wrong?

14:22.000 --> 14:24.441
I recall things going to shit

14:24.474 --> 14:26.347
somewhere around the time you showed up.

14:26.380 --> 14:28.042
Oh, pshaw. The very idea.

14:28.076 --> 14:29.610
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

14:29.643 --> 14:32.114
let us not rehash ancient history, right?

14:32.147 --> 14:34.850
Okay, Sam went off the rails,

14:34.883 --> 14:37.218
they shut the picture down,

14:37.251 --> 14:38.690
my beloved wife divorced me.

14:38.723 --> 14:41.689
But did I wallow?

14:41.723 --> 14:44.297
Well, yeah. Sure.

14:44.330 --> 14:47.129
But then I picked myself the fuck up,

14:47.162 --> 14:49.698
I dusted myself off,

14:49.731 --> 14:52.907
and I sold that messy,
late-term abortion as a TV pilot.

14:52.940 --> 14:54.506
Because that is what a producer does.

14:54.539 --> 14:56.840
He takes a sudden burst of rain

14:56.872 --> 14:59.070
and turns it into a golden shower.

14:59.103 --> 15:01.606
[Door opens]

15:02.776 --> 15:05.142
Quiet.

15:05.175 --> 15:06.446
Writers start talking shit about you

15:06.479 --> 15:07.844
the second you leave the room.

15:07.877 --> 15:11.651
I want to know whose option not
to pick up when the time comes.

15:13.847 --> 15:15.677
Rosenberg.

15:15.710 --> 15:18.415
You fuckin' dick.

15:18.448 --> 15:22.562
You'll get yours. Heh! Very nice.

15:22.595 --> 15:26.959
Try paying for private
school next year with no job.

15:28.160 --> 15:29.127
You must be Hank.

15:29.160 --> 15:30.894
Henry James moody the first.

15:30.927 --> 15:33.228
Rick Rath. Call me Rath.

15:33.261 --> 15:35.897
Who are you? Why are
you here? I'm his agent.

15:35.930 --> 15:38.803
He likes to make sure I don't
use my feces as a crayon.

15:38.836 --> 15:41.467
Take a walk. You guys too. Get out.

15:41.508 --> 15:44.473
Leave us alone. Talent only.

15:44.506 --> 15:45.769
Remember what I told you.

15:45.810 --> 15:47.705
Guy's a monster. Leave us alone.

15:47.746 --> 15:52.114
- Just a fucking monster.
- Talent only.

15:53.515 --> 15:55.143
I'm not gonna hire you, Hank.

15:55.184 --> 15:56.815
Really?

15:56.848 --> 15:58.350
Yeah.

15:58.383 --> 16:00.212
You don't even want to hear
what I think about the script?

16:00.253 --> 16:02.052
I mean, I had a whole speech
prepared and everything,

16:02.085 --> 16:04.219
followed by a PowerPoint presentation

16:04.252 --> 16:06.984
and a brief but very moving puppet show.

16:07.017 --> 16:09.255
Stu had asked me to sit down with you,

16:09.288 --> 16:11.055
I-I admit I was intrigued,

16:11.088 --> 16:14.021
but then I did my due diligence.

16:14.054 --> 16:16.491
And every single person I reached out to

16:16.524 --> 16:18.555
said you are an absolute,
fucking nightmare.

16:18.596 --> 16:21.797
So there you have it, case closed.

16:21.830 --> 16:22.932
I mean, sorry, but the last
thing I need around here

16:22.965 --> 16:24.732
is some snotty, pretentious fuck

16:24.765 --> 16:25.932
who's gonna look down on television.

16:25.965 --> 16:28.035
Yeah, but if I'm not wrong,

16:28.069 --> 16:30.033
you do need a writer who
can actually write, right?

16:30.066 --> 16:32.271
Well, yeah, talent's always a plus,

16:32.304 --> 16:34.903
but life is too short
for shenanigans, Hank.

16:34.936 --> 16:37.342
I'm... I'm too old to be babysitting

16:37.375 --> 16:38.741
toddlers with toxic personalities.

16:38.774 --> 16:42.570
Okay, just hang on and hear me out, okay?

16:42.611 --> 16:43.906
If I'm not mistaken,

16:43.939 --> 16:46.273
you got a room full of
hacks and wannabes in there.

16:46.313 --> 16:48.775
The hacks give you a safe,
fear-driven mediocrity

16:48.808 --> 16:50.741
because they just want to
keep their pools heated,

16:50.782 --> 16:51.875
and the wannabes wanna be

16:51.908 --> 16:53.379
because the lifestyle looks so swell,

16:53.412 --> 16:55.580
but they have nothing to
write about and it shows.

16:55.613 --> 16:58.653
That's an incredibly
cynical generalization, Hank.

16:58.686 --> 17:00.653
I am the best of both worlds.

17:00.686 --> 17:03.455
I have the... the sexy,
energetic brain of a newbie

17:03.496 --> 17:05.192
and the body of a drunken, old hack.

17:05.233 --> 17:06.960
And you shit the bed all over this town.

17:07.001 --> 17:10.732
So why would this gig be any different?

17:10.765 --> 17:12.300
Fair enough. That's a good point.

17:12.334 --> 17:15.036
And I have squandered a lot
of opportunities, it's true.

17:15.069 --> 17:16.133
Yeah.

17:16.173 --> 17:17.469
I could give you a bunch of excuses.

17:17.502 --> 17:19.142
I could blame it on my masturbating agent

17:19.175 --> 17:21.008
or I could chalk it up

17:21.049 --> 17:22.776
to fear and self-loathing in Los Angeles,

17:22.817 --> 17:24.545
but the truth is that...

17:24.586 --> 17:27.785
I'm trying to grow the fuck up for once.

17:27.818 --> 17:30.889
You know, I'm on a quest to
reclaim the best parts of myself

17:30.922 --> 17:32.793
before it's too fuckin' late.

17:32.828 --> 17:34.692
And it all starts with me getting a job.

17:34.733 --> 17:36.764
Well...

17:36.797 --> 17:38.398
That's very inspiring,

17:38.439 --> 17:40.366
but are you sure you can
actually handle the job?

17:40.407 --> 17:42.070
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

17:42.103 --> 17:43.509
- Mm-hmm.
- Can you show up on time?

17:43.542 --> 17:45.342
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

17:45.375 --> 17:47.847
Play nice with others?

17:47.880 --> 17:49.182
May... Maybe. Yeah.

17:49.215 --> 17:51.413
Can you take a note
without getting defensive?

17:51.446 --> 17:53.381
Possibly.

17:53.414 --> 17:55.919
Can you work with actors
without fucking them

17:55.952 --> 17:58.091
