00:37.579 --> 00:40.081
Manjula, why did you bring
the octuplets to work?

00:40.165 --> 00:42.542
This is supposed to be
our special time together.

00:42.626 --> 00:44.335
Some special time.

00:44.420 --> 00:46.504
I get to stand around watching you sell

00:46.588 --> 00:49.298
fatty poisons to overfed Americans.

00:50.759 --> 00:53.469
You'd think that would deter me, but no.

00:56.098 --> 00:58.182
Look. Please, can you just
take the children home?

00:58.267 --> 01:01.728
The porno magazine buyers are too
embarrassed to make their move. Look.

01:04.355 --> 01:05.355
Come on.

01:05.441 --> 01:07.567
All right. Let's go, children.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.072
Cleanup in all the aisles.

01:16.160 --> 01:17.827
Welcome, steady customer.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.663
I see you are ready for
the Civil War reenactment.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.165
I need some supplies.

01:22.249 --> 01:25.918
A keg of beer and a six-pack
to hold me until I tap the keg.

01:26.003 --> 01:27.503
Here you go. Thanks.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.088
Are you sure you don't want to come?

01:29.173 --> 01:33.009
In a Civil War reenactment, we
need lots of Indians to shoot.

01:33.510 --> 01:36.053
I don't know which part of
that sentence to correct first.

01:36.138 --> 01:39.182
But I cannot come. I work 22 hours a day

01:39.266 --> 01:41.726
and then I go home to a
wife who will not touch me.

01:41.810 --> 01:44.604
The Indian rope trick has
become the Indian nope trick.

01:49.401 --> 01:51.360
The Squishee Lady!

01:51.445 --> 01:52.570
Oh, my God.

01:53.489 --> 01:56.783
I know you must get this all the
time, but can I suggest a flavor?

01:56.867 --> 01:57.950
Go ahead.

01:58.035 --> 01:59.535
Grape. Mmm.

02:01.288 --> 02:02.538
Hello, Annette.

02:02.706 --> 02:03.956
How's life, handsome?

02:04.041 --> 02:06.209
Oh, take a penny, leave a penny.

02:08.586 --> 02:10.463
Hey, she called me "handsome. "

02:10.547 --> 02:12.173
She likes you.

02:12.299 --> 02:14.008
Put in a good word for grape.

02:14.092 --> 02:15.843
Come on, guys! We're gonna be late!

02:15.928 --> 02:18.805
Okay, okay. Don't go Mary Todd on us.

02:29.233 --> 02:30.316
Come on, Barney.

02:30.400 --> 02:33.861
If you're gonna be General
Grant, you have to have a drink.

02:33.946 --> 02:36.739
Yeah, but I'm a
recovering alcoholic, so...

02:36.824 --> 02:38.407
One drink won't hurt.

02:42.120 --> 02:44.330
Hey, you're right.

02:44.414 --> 02:46.624
I was afraid it would
start me drinking again,

02:46.708 --> 02:48.209
but it didn't! Mmm-hmm.

02:49.336 --> 02:53.005
The second battle of Springfield
was fought by the North,

02:53.757 --> 02:56.384
the South, and the East

02:58.095 --> 03:00.346
to keep Springfield in, out of,

03:00.472 --> 03:02.682
and next to the Union, respectively.

03:02.766 --> 03:04.851
Now, the actual battle
was fought over there

03:04.935 --> 03:06.978
where that man is standing,

03:07.104 --> 03:09.188
but he won't move, so we'll do it here.

03:09.273 --> 03:13.317
Very good. And now, let
the battle be joined.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.032
Bang, bang.

03:20.117 --> 03:21.409
Pow, pow.

03:21.785 --> 03:25.580
Hit with stick. Hit with
stick. Die, you bastard.

03:25.956 --> 03:28.708
Whoa. Whoa, damn it.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.003
For me, the war is over!

03:33.463 --> 03:36.465
This battlefield is
rife with inaccuracy.

03:37.593 --> 03:39.552
You, dead people, stop playing cards!

03:39.887 --> 03:42.430
And Stonewall Jackson,
stop rollerblading!

03:48.312 --> 03:50.688
The South will boogie again!

03:54.693 --> 03:56.569
This was supposed to be a mock battle!

03:56.653 --> 03:59.030
Mock! Don't worry.

03:59.114 --> 04:02.658
I'm just gonna drain the
area around your wound.

04:02.743 --> 04:05.578
So cold. So cold.

04:08.248 --> 04:11.417
We are gathered here this Memorial Day

04:11.501 --> 04:15.254
to once again honor you
World War II veterans.

04:15.339 --> 04:18.841
Truly, you are the greatest generation.

04:19.301 --> 04:21.427
Keep it coming, Brokaw!

04:21.511 --> 04:24.931
Lauding your legacy is a labor of love.

04:25.015 --> 04:27.642
You're damn right, it is!
You can't thank us enough!

04:27.726 --> 04:30.269
Every generation stinks but ours!

04:33.732 --> 04:34.774
Uh-oh.

04:34.858 --> 04:38.277
Sounds like America's
enemies are at it again.

04:38.362 --> 04:41.405
Greatest generation to the rescue!

04:45.577 --> 04:47.912
And when I come back, I want a foot rub!

04:47.996 --> 04:49.288
Yes, master.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.251
General, I hereby surrender.

04:54.336 --> 04:57.630
Ow! Not the pointed end, you dumbass!

05:01.343 --> 05:02.969
Reinforcements!

05:06.556 --> 05:09.976
Tanks? Oh, this is just too inaccurate.

05:10.268 --> 05:12.561
Well, then you're definitely not going

05:12.688 --> 05:14.981
to like my steam-powered super spider.

05:15.065 --> 05:19.318
With the stepping and the squishing
and the webs made of nylon.

05:27.452 --> 05:30.079
The nylon has been released!

05:31.415 --> 05:34.834
Now, you just take the kids
home. I've gotta return this keg.

05:34.918 --> 05:37.169
Are you sure you can
get your deposit back?

05:37.254 --> 05:38.879
It's in pretty bad shape.

05:38.964 --> 05:41.924
Why do you always take the
side of local merchants?

05:42.968 --> 05:46.512
Now, Apu, when you gave
me this keg, it had dents.

05:46.596 --> 05:47.930
And here's proof.

05:50.058 --> 05:51.308
Hey. Apu?

05:55.439 --> 05:59.191
That giggle is none of
my business, or is it?

06:06.783 --> 06:10.870
Squishee Lady, you've had less
than eight kids, haven't you?

06:10.954 --> 06:12.288
Haven't you?

07:05.175 --> 07:07.510
Please do the Hindu that you do so well.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.262
Avert your eyes, eunuch.

07:11.515 --> 07:13.099
What's a eunuch?

07:14.518 --> 07:16.268
"Unique... Unite... "

07:17.896 --> 07:19.271
Homie, what's wrong?

07:19.356 --> 07:20.397
Nothing. Nothing.

07:20.482 --> 07:22.191
There's nothing eating me up inside.

07:24.361 --> 07:27.696
Oh. It must be something big.

07:27.781 --> 07:28.781
Hmm.

07:28.865 --> 07:33.869
Something you did?
No! Something you saw?

07:35.539 --> 07:37.998
Apu is having an affair?

07:38.083 --> 07:39.667
I know. Can you believe it?

07:39.751 --> 07:42.002
Oh, Manjula's just gonna die!

07:42.087 --> 07:43.963
How did you find out?

07:44.047 --> 07:47.133
In my role as customer,
I saw the whole thing.

07:47.217 --> 07:49.093
Oh, this is so awkward.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.804
Today's the day we play
badminton with them.

07:51.888 --> 07:54.723
Oh, I hope no one makes
any double entendres.

07:57.185 --> 08:00.896
Oh, Apu, you keep scoring
while my back is turned.

08:02.524 --> 08:04.483
Are you sure you're not cheating?

08:06.111 --> 08:08.904
Now, Manjula, do you want
me to find another partner?

08:08.989 --> 08:13.200
No! No, no, let's just keep
playing. What's the score?

08:13.285 --> 08:15.578
Dirty love. I mean 30-love!

08:15.745 --> 08:17.913
I mean, anyone for penis?

08:17.998 --> 08:20.040
I'll just get the shuttlecock.

08:20.125 --> 08:21.250
Oh!

08:28.175 --> 08:31.886
Here, guys. Why don't we play this?

08:49.404 --> 08:51.363
Marge, why are you crying?

08:51.448 --> 08:53.282
You're not in any physical pain,

08:53.366 --> 08:56.035
the only kind of pain
a man can understand.

08:56.119 --> 08:59.079
We have to do something
to save that marriage.

09:00.248 --> 09:04.543
Maybe I should just tell
Manjula. Or you could talk to Apu.

09:04.628 --> 09:06.378
He already knows.

09:06.463 --> 09:07.546
Let's tell Krusty.

09:07.631 --> 09:09.131
What would that accomplish?

09:09.216 --> 09:12.801
That guy's hilarious. His
reaction would be priceless.

09:13.094 --> 09:14.678
Apu is cheating.

09:15.430 --> 09:18.474
That's sad. All those kids.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.393
I think he's building to something.

09:23.647 --> 09:28.067
So anyway, if you take that
bottle down and pass it around...

09:28.151 --> 09:31.904
I know. I know. There will be 47
bottles of beer on the wall. Yes.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.864
Homer, you did not
bring me here for this.

09:33.949 --> 09:35.366
What is it that you want to tell me?

09:35.450 --> 09:38.035
Okay. This isn't easy, so I'm
just gonna come out and say it.

09:38.119 --> 09:41.580
Let's say this pepper got
married to this salt shaker,

09:41.665 --> 09:45.334
and along comes sexy Mrs. Dash.

09:45.418 --> 09:48.712
Homie, it's 11:00 at night.
Have you told him yet?

09:48.797 --> 09:50.589
A girl in the bar! What do we do?

09:50.674 --> 09:52.549
Watch and learn, you dinks.

09:54.219 --> 09:55.219
Ma'am.

09:55.637 --> 09:57.930
Is there something you want to tell me?

09:58.014 --> 10:00.849
I saw you and that Squishee Lady

10:01.184 --> 10:03.310
canoodling like junkyard rabbits!

10:03.395 --> 10:05.479
It's true.

10:05.563 --> 10:08.524
It only happened once,
but I am so ashamed.

10:08.692 --> 10:10.025
I am scum.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.780
Yes, you are scum.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.617
What do you think I should do?

10:18.702 --> 10:21.453
Tell that woman it's
over between you and her.

10:21.538 --> 10:23.789
Yes. First thing in
the morning, I promise.

10:23.873 --> 10:26.542
Hey, Marge, you care
for a tropical drink?

10:26.626 --> 10:28.252
Sure.

10:28.336 --> 10:29.628
Is that Windex?

10:29.713 --> 10:32.298
It's Windelle. I can't afford Windex.

10:36.678 --> 10:39.179
Okay, Apu, be strong.

10:39.889 --> 10:43.642
Before you measure my syrup
levels, I must talk to you.

10:43.727 --> 10:44.977
While you talk,

10:45.061 --> 10:47.479
I'm just gonna help myself
to some licorice rope.

10:47.564 --> 10:50.274
As much as I enjoy your
company, and I truly do,

10:50.358 --> 10:53.319
I must insist that from
this point forward, we not...

10:53.403 --> 10:55.946
Oh, my goodness! What are you doing?

10:59.284 --> 11:02.870
Whoa, ha-mahatama, hatama, hatama,
hatama, hatama, hatama, hatama.

11:05.749 --> 11:09.418
Not tonight. I said not tonight.

11:10.462 --> 11:12.713
Wait, something's wrong.

11:12.797 --> 11:15.215
Why aren't you pressuring me for sex?

11:15.300 --> 11:16.925
Oh, I'm just happy to lie here

11:17.010 --> 11:18.844
appreciating and respecting you.

11:18.928 --> 11:21.722
Okay, Buster, what is going on?

11:21.806 --> 11:25.392
Nothing! How can you even
accuse me of repeated infidelity?

11:25.477 --> 11:28.187
I am so angry, I could just,
I could fall asleep! I...

11:33.443 --> 11:35.152
...completely innocent.

11:37.447 --> 11:40.032
Apu! Come here a moment!

11:40.116 --> 11:43.786
This better be good because you
are interrupting my faithfulness...

11:43.870 --> 11:44.870
Oh, boy.

11:44.954 --> 11:48.999
I took the tape out of the
store surveillance camera. Look.

11:49.084 --> 11:52.378
Oh, Apu, scratch and win!

11:52.796 --> 11:55.714
Mmm! That's good adultery!

11:57.675 --> 11:59.426
Oh, I am so sorry, Manjula.

11:59.511 --> 12:02.179
Oh! Get out of my home, Apu!

12:12.982 --> 12:16.318
I always thought karma was
baloney, but not anymore.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.154
Caramel baloney.

12:21.157 --> 12:25.202
Hey, Kirk Van Houten.
I live across the way.

12:25.620 --> 12:28.705
If you don't like losing at
cribbage, stay out of my place.

12:28.790 --> 12:29.915
Okay.

12:29.999 --> 12:32.000
No, no! I'll let you
win. I'll let you win.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.628
God, I'm really lonely.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.965
Welcome back to Inside
The Actors Studio.

12:38.049 --> 12:39.591
We've met Rainier Wolfcastle,

12:39.676 --> 12:42.928
actor, novelist,
barbecue sauce spokesman.

12:43.012 --> 12:45.139
Now can we meet McBain?

12:45.557 --> 12:47.599
Let me get into character.

12:49.519 --> 12:52.020
Okay, I'm McBain.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.900
All right, Mendoza!

12:56.985 --> 13:01.071
I'll give you the Maxwell Circuit
if you put down my daughter.

13:05.535 --> 13:09.204
It's a pleasure to eat
your lead, good sir.

13:10.707 --> 13:13.667
Kids, we want to talk
to you about something.

13:13.751 --> 13:16.920
You might hear from your
friends or co-workers

13:17.005 --> 13:19.756
that Apu isn't living at home anymore.

13:19.841 --> 13:22.926
I just wish there was
something we could do.

13:23.178 --> 13:24.178
Oh.

13:24.262 --> 13:27.431
Oh, Homer, are you
thinking what I'm thinking?

13:27.515 --> 13:28.974
You bet I am.

13:32.395 --> 13:35.439
You can run, but you can't glide!

13:38.193 --> 13:40.360
USA! USA!

13:40.445 --> 13:44.907
Tonight, we invite both
Manjula and Apu for dinner,

13:44.991 --> 13:47.993
but we don't tell them
the other one's coming.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.038
And Krusty. We gotta invite Krusty.

13:51.122 --> 13:53.499
I keep telling you, off-camera,

13:53.583 --> 13:56.084
he's a desperately unhappy man.

13:56.294 --> 13:59.963
But if we remind Apu and
Manjula of why they fell in love,

14:00.048 --> 14:02.174
maybe they can work out their problems.

14:02.258 --> 14:05.427
Yeah! 'Cause if they don't...

14:11.100 --> 14:14.603
Manjula, we've got a
special guest for you.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.522
Is it my husband's whore?

14:16.606 --> 14:18.065
Even better!

14:18.942 --> 14:20.776
This is going great!

14:21.152 --> 14:25.280
Look who's here! It's this thing!

14:27.283 --> 14:29.868
I am Ganesh, your god.

14:30.954 --> 14:32.204
I am truly screwed.

14:32.288 --> 14:37.042
I order you to get back
together or I'll suck your blood!

14:37.126 --> 14:38.377
Blah, blah!

14:38.461 --> 14:40.003
Bart, stick to the script.

14:40.088 --> 14:41.171
Don't be a jerk.

14:41.256 --> 14:43.590
You're the jerk. You're the jerk!

14:50.014 --> 14:53.392
I know you have all gone to a lot
of trouble to meddle in my affairs,

14:53.643 --> 14:56.687
but you cannot change my mind
with one night of blasphemy

14:56.771 --> 15:00.399
and store-bought tandoori.
Or should I say blandoori?

15:01.693 --> 15:03.443
Manjula, please.

15:03.528 --> 15:05.070
I have known we were
meant to be together

15:05.154 --> 15:07.573
ever since my mother
forced me to marry you.

15:07.657 --> 15:08.865
If you give me another chance,

15:08.950 --> 15:10.867
I'll do anything to make it up to you.

15:11.536 --> 15:12.536
Mmm.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.288
Come here, you.

15:15.164 --> 15:18.625
These are divorce papers!
Consider yourself served!

15:20.837 --> 15:23.839
Hey, pally. Where do
you want the Fudge Mahal?

15:25.675 --> 15:27.926
Uh, we didn't order that.

15:28.886 --> 15:31.847
Can I lick your fingers?
Meet me at the mail slot.

15:37.562 --> 15:41.106
I have to warn you, Apu does
not have very much money.

15:41.190 --> 15:42.649
Are you absolutely sure?

15:42.734 --> 15:44.860
Because legally, I am
allowed to shake him

15:44.944 --> 15:47.863
by the ankles and see what falls out.

15:47.947 --> 15:51.366
It's established in the
case of Lawyers v. Justice.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.994
That was a wonderful day for us.

15:56.205 --> 15:58.498
Now, we have eight children.

15:58.875 --> 16:00.792
Will that affect the settlement?

16:03.546 --> 16:04.630
Perhaps.

16:09.093 --> 16:11.720
No offense, but you
remind me of the monkey man

16:11.804 --> 16:13.639
who slaughtered my family's chickens.

16:13.723 --> 16:15.891
Yes. I get that a lot.

16:17.143 --> 16:18.935
I have to think all of this over.

16:19.020 --> 16:20.896
I still have feelings for Apu.

16:21.898 --> 16:23.398
I understand.

16:24.233 --> 16:25.317
Who is Apu?

16:25.401 --> 16:29.196
The face of divorce is not
as beautiful as I had hoped.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.989
Perhaps there is another way.

16:31.074 --> 16:36.161
When will you humans learn that
your feelings, as you call them,

16:36.245 --> 16:40.415
can stand in the way
of big cash payoffs?

16:47.924 --> 16:51.802
Manjula, come quick! The
octuplets said their first words.

16:52.428 --> 16:53.679
Mommy... Will...

16:53.763 --> 16:54.805
You... Let...

16:54.889 --> 16:56.098
Daddy... Come...

16:56.182 --> 16:57.349
Back? Cookie!

16:57.433 --> 16:59.935
Oh. They miss their father.

17:00.436 --> 17:02.604
Are you sure you don't
want to take him back?

17:02.689 --> 17:07.442
Well, I do, but I don't want
him to think that I am a doormat.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.027
I need payback!

17:09.112 --> 17:11.613
All right! Girls night out!

17:11.698 --> 17:14.074
Exotic male dancers
at the Golden Banana!

17:14.157 --> 17:16.451
No. I want him to suffer.

17:16.536 --> 17:19.746
Oh. Well, when Homer
does something wrong,

17:19.830 --> 17:22.624
I write a list of ways
he can make it up to me.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.460
Then I shred the list
and put it in his food.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.671
All right. We will write a list.

17:27.755 --> 17:28.839
At the Golden Banana?

17:28.923 --> 17:29.965
No!

17:30.174 --> 17:31.174
Oh.

17:31.592 --> 17:36.596
Over, under, round and round so
your feet won't touch the ground.

17:38.933 --> 17:42.436
Now let's see what awaits
me in the next life.

17:42.895 --> 17:48.066
First I was a tiger, a snake, a
clod, a goat with a hat, then me.

17:48.151 --> 17:51.737
A tapeworm, then assistant
to Lorne Michaels!

17:52.447 --> 17:55.115
It's going to be a rough
couple of lifetimes.

17:57.326 --> 17:58.368
Manjula!

17:58.453 --> 18:00.829
Oh, Apu, you are such a Brahma queen.

18:01.664 --> 18:03.081
Have you come to forgive me?

18:03.207 --> 18:04.624
I am willing to take you back...

18:04.709 --> 18:07.502
Really? Provided you
complete these tasks.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.838
"Number one, break up
with Squishee girl. "

18:09.922 --> 18:11.465
Well, that's a no-brainer.

18:11.549 --> 18:13.091
"Number two, lose weight.

18:13.176 --> 18:16.094
"Number three, get cartoon
published in New Yorker.

18:16.179 --> 18:20.307
"Number four, legally change
name to Slime Q. Slimedog.

18:20.391 --> 18:23.602
"Number five, wear
nametag that says same. "

18:23.686 --> 18:27.439
I know a great nametag
place. They do fabulous work.

18:27.523 --> 18:28.857
It's where I got this.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.862
So our relationship is over,
is that what you're saying?

18:33.946 --> 18:35.697
Yes, I'm afraid so.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.158
Well, we had fun.

18:38.242 --> 18:41.203
Hey, Apu, I think she likes you.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.169
This Squishee's awful.

18:49.253 --> 18:53.256
I only sell Smooshies now.
Squishees reminded me of my misdeeds.

18:54.383 --> 18:57.302
My Smooshie tastes like a shopping bag.

18:57.386 --> 18:59.888
Mine tastes like dog fur!

19:00.181 --> 19:02.057
Yes, but look at the deliveryman.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.725
He is hideous.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.603
Oh, a challenge!

19:11.859 --> 19:13.944
Wait a minute! This isn't on the list!

19:14.028 --> 19:16.571
It's been on my list for a long time!

19:22.286 --> 19:23.411
Not bad, eh?

19:23.496 --> 19:26.706
I bought the issue for Richard
Avedon's pictures of Lenny.

19:28.417 --> 19:31.711
"Eliza, where the
devil are my slippers?"

19:34.966 --> 19:36.341
Bravo! Bravo!

19:36.425 --> 19:40.136
"My Fair Lady performed with
all-octuplet cast. " Done.

19:41.389 --> 19:42.347
Good show! Yeah!

19:42.431 --> 19:43.515
Yeah!

19:43.599 --> 19:45.141
It was magic.

19:45.226 --> 19:49.813
He took a Cockney flower girl
and turned her into My Fair Lady.

19:49.897 --> 19:52.691
I liked all the roles
filled by minority actors.

19:52.775 --> 19:54.860
Why, I didn't even notice.

19:54.944 --> 19:57.487
Apu, you have completed the list.

19:57.572 --> 19:59.197
You may now move back with your family

19:59.282 --> 20:01.074
and your never-ending disgrace.

20:01.158 --> 20:04.452
Wait, wait! You forgot
to eat a light bulb.

20:05.121 --> 20:07.414
Thank you very much,
you big fat blabbermouth!

20:07.498 --> 20:11.042
I... Sorry, sorry.
It's been a rough month.

20:11.127 --> 20:15.589
Here you go. Don't worry, I soaked
it in the toilet to soften it up.

20:20.052 --> 20:25.056
So, back in the old bed. I
never realized it was so wide.

20:25.141 --> 20:27.934
Yes, back to our marital closeness.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.521
Maybe we can't rush things.

20:31.606 --> 20:34.816
Oh, Apu, I want us to be a family again.

20:35.067 --> 20:39.195
But it will take some time. We
will know when it feels right again.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.656
Whenever you are ready.
