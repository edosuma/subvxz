WEBVTT

00:01.713 --> 00:02.562
I'm pregnant.

00:04.313 --> 00:07.463
'Police in Polesford are continuing
their search for the missing

00:07.513 --> 00:11.263
schoolgirls Poppy Johnston and
Abigail Toms. Shit. What?

00:11.313 --> 00:14.463
Suspect's wife, I know her.
She was my best friend.

00:14.513 --> 00:17.363
I'm going have to go to Polesford.
All right, I'll get them to endorse

00:17.413 --> 00:20.663
access to Linda Bates,
but no stepping on anyone's toes.

00:20.713 --> 00:23.613
We're going to be grandads! Come here.

00:23.813 --> 00:25.563
It's just weird being back.

00:25.613 --> 00:27.563
You know, seeing Linda.

00:28.013 --> 00:29.163
Two girls,

00:29.213 --> 00:31.463
one missing over three weeks.
What do you think?

00:31.513 --> 00:34.563
'Abigail's burnt remains were
discovered in woodland yesterday.

00:34.613 --> 00:36.563
'Poppy Johnston is still missing.'

00:36.613 --> 00:39.563
So, let me guess... coppers.

00:39.613 --> 00:41.563
How's the holiday in Murder Town?

00:41.613 --> 00:43.563
I mean, no-one really knows anyone,
do they?

00:43.613 --> 00:46.563
Do you ever think about what
happened all them years ago?

00:46.613 --> 00:48.613
Yeah. Every day.

00:49.613 --> 00:51.613
So, is it mine?

02:26.613 --> 02:29.563
I used to come here when I was younger.

02:29.613 --> 02:31.613
It wasn't deserted then.

02:32.613 --> 02:34.613
We used to go crazy in those cornfields.

02:36.613 --> 02:39.563
I was younger... getting off with boys,

02:39.613 --> 02:42.563
fumbling around like we
knew what we were doing...

02:42.613 --> 02:43.563
And this is relevant, is it?

02:43.613 --> 02:45.563
To you being pregnant with my kid.

02:45.613 --> 02:46.563
It's not yours.

02:46.613 --> 02:47.563
Ah, come on!

02:47.613 --> 02:50.613
It is relevant. If you just wait...

02:52.613 --> 02:55.613
Fine. Tell me the story.

02:57.613 --> 03:00.563
It's what I do, Adam.
I sabotage my life.

03:00.613 --> 03:04.563
You know, you think I was unhappy,
but maybe it was the opposite.

03:04.613 --> 03:07.563
Maybe I was just terrified of
the happiness I was feeling.

03:07.613 --> 03:09.563
Does he know about us?

03:09.613 --> 03:11.613
What do you think?

03:13.613 --> 03:14.563
How about I tell him?

03:14.613 --> 03:16.563
Oh, yeah, that's a great idea,

03:16.613 --> 03:19.563
then how about I tell the rest of
the force? Cos that'll go down well,

03:19.613 --> 03:20.563
shagging your colleague's girlfriend.

03:20.613 --> 03:21.972
You'll be trusted undercover.

03:22.172 --> 03:24.563
Helen, I didn't come here
to have a scrap with you.

03:24.613 --> 03:28.563
I came here because...
Yes, to talk to you about the baby,

03:28.613 --> 03:31.563
but also to say that, if it is mine...

03:31.613 --> 03:34.613
and I reckon there's a pretty
high chance it is, don't you...?

03:37.613 --> 03:40.613
that I want to be a part of its life.

03:42.613 --> 03:44.613
And I want to be a part of yours.

03:53.613 --> 03:56.563
As most of you will already know,
Stephen Bates,

03:56.613 --> 04:01.563
the man we believe to be responsible
for the murder of Abigail Toms,

04:01.613 --> 04:04.563
is now on remand awaiting trial.

04:04.613 --> 04:07.563
While I commend Detective
Inspector Cornish

04:07.613 --> 04:11.563
and his team for their excellent
work on this tragic case,

04:11.613 --> 04:16.563
we must not lose sight of the fact
that there is an inquiry still ongoing,

04:16.613 --> 04:19.563
so Poppy's parents, Michael and Annette,

04:19.613 --> 04:21.563
are going to make a short statement,

04:21.613 --> 04:24.613
after which I will be happy
to answer any questions.

04:26.613 --> 04:30.563
Stephen Bates has persistently
refused to tell police

04:30.613 --> 04:31.563
where our daughter is.

04:31.613 --> 04:37.563
So today we are appealing to
anyone who might know anything

04:37.613 --> 04:40.613
to please come forward and
help police find Poppy.

04:41.613 --> 04:43.563
She has been missing for five days now

04:43.613 --> 04:46.563
and we are desperate to hear from her.

04:46.613 --> 04:49.563
Poppy is only 16 years
old and it's completely

04:49.613 --> 04:52.563
out of character for her to
leave home without telling us.

04:52.613 --> 04:53.563
And we just want her...

04:53.613 --> 04:57.563
All I am saying is just go home...
let me have my space...

04:57.613 --> 05:01.563
and then when I'm back in Manchester,
you know, we...

05:02.613 --> 05:04.613
Oh, shit!

05:06.613 --> 05:07.563
What's wrong?

05:07.613 --> 05:09.563
'I'm at the hospital.'

05:09.613 --> 05:11.563
Stephen Bates tried to kill himself.

05:11.613 --> 05:12.563
Right, OK.

05:12.613 --> 05:15.563
Thanks for letting me know,
I'll be over there as soon as I can.

05:15.613 --> 05:18.563
What?

05:18.613 --> 05:20.563
I've got to go... you need to get out.

05:20.613 --> 05:22.563
You what?
We're in the middle of nowhere!

05:22.613 --> 05:23.563
Well, ring a cab.

05:23.613 --> 05:24.563
I don't have a number.

05:24.613 --> 05:26.613
Oh, Google it. I've got to go, now.

05:31.613 --> 05:34.613
You need to tell him about
us and about the baby.

05:38.613 --> 05:40.813
And you need to decide
what future you want.

06:15.613 --> 06:16.613
Hey.

06:18.613 --> 06:23.613
He got hold of a ballpoint pen,
tried to do his wrists.

06:24.613 --> 06:25.613
Is he all right?

06:27.613 --> 06:30.563
No-one'll talk to me.

06:30.613 --> 06:32.613
No-one'll tell me anything.

06:36.613 --> 06:39.613
Looks like he was trying to
take the easy way out, don't it?

06:42.613 --> 06:44.613
That's what they'll say, isn't it?

06:46.613 --> 06:48.613
They'll say that in the papers.

07:01.613 --> 07:02.913
Still think he didn't do it?

07:04.613 --> 07:06.813
Admit it doesn't exactly
scream innocence.

07:08.613 --> 07:12.563
But right now the entire country
thinks he's a child-killer.

07:12.613 --> 07:13.563
How do you think that feels?

07:13.613 --> 07:15.563
Pretty terrible.

07:15.613 --> 07:17.613
Yeah, especially if it's not true.

07:19.613 --> 07:22.563
Thought you'd been warned off.

07:22.613 --> 07:24.563
Cornish told me he'd
told you to go home.

07:24.613 --> 07:25.613
Yeah. I have.

07:28.613 --> 07:33.563
Helen, people's careers can
get ruined by stuff like this.

07:33.613 --> 07:36.613
Is she really worth it? Linda?

07:48.613 --> 07:53.563
'You have two new messages
and five saved messages.

07:53.613 --> 07:56.563
'Helen, it's Jenny. Have you
spoken to Paul yet? Ring me back.

07:56.613 --> 07:58.563
'Bye.

07:58.613 --> 08:00.563
'Hey, Hels, I'm just heading into town,

08:00.613 --> 08:02.613
'why don't you meet me
in the pub in a bit?'

08:14.613 --> 08:17.563
Paul, we need to talk.

08:17.613 --> 08:20.613
Paul, I've got to tell you something.
Paul... I...

08:24.613 --> 08:28.613
I really messed up, Paul, and, er...

08:30.613 --> 08:33.613
I really hope this baby's yours,
but...

09:10.613 --> 09:12.563
Look who it is...
Linda Bates's girlfriend.

09:12.613 --> 09:16.563
Fucking rug-muncher. Waiting for you
at home, is she? The murdering bitch.

09:16.613 --> 09:17.563
All right, lads.
Shut your mouth!

09:17.613 --> 09:19.563
Eh! You know I'm a policewoman, right?

09:19.613 --> 09:21.563
We don't give a shit.
We knew Abi and we knew Poppy.

09:21.613 --> 09:25.113
All right, this is intimidation, so if
you don't get out of my way, now, I'm...

09:51.613 --> 09:52.613
Helen Weeks!

10:00.613 --> 10:01.563
Phil! Wha...

10:01.613 --> 10:02.713
Paul asked me to come.

10:03.613 --> 10:07.563
What?
I thought you hated the countryside.

10:07.613 --> 10:11.563
Oh, not the countryside as such,
just everyone in it.

10:11.613 --> 10:14.563
And how often do you find out
that one of your best friends

10:14.613 --> 10:17.563
is having a... cause for a celebration?

10:17.613 --> 10:19.563
I demand Champagne immediately,

10:19.613 --> 10:22.563
or, er, failing that, several
pints of strong Continental lager.

10:22.613 --> 10:23.563
Shall we?

10:23.613 --> 10:25.563
I'd love to.

10:25.613 --> 10:27.563
Hey!

10:27.613 --> 10:29.563
What is this place?

10:29.613 --> 10:30.613
Hell on Earth.

10:32.613 --> 10:37.563
So, I popped in to see the
coroner and I saw the body.

10:37.613 --> 10:39.563
How did you do that?

10:39.613 --> 10:42.563
What can I say, the guy must've
liked me, I have a certain charm.

10:42.613 --> 10:45.563
'.. reporting from outside the
East Derbyshire Hospital where

10:45.613 --> 10:48.563
'we've been informed Stephen Bates
has been admitted. Police...'

10:48.613 --> 10:50.563
Guilt.
'.. refuse to comment on why...'

10:50.613 --> 10:52.563
He tried to top himself,
couldn't live with it.

10:52.613 --> 10:53.563
Looks like they've got their man.

10:53.613 --> 10:56.563
So, how is the body?

10:56.613 --> 10:58.563
Not a lot left of her, to be honest...

10:58.613 --> 11:01.563
most of the skin had been
removed by insect invasion.

11:01.613 --> 11:03.563
Tell me about the report.

11:03.613 --> 11:06.563
Hello! Looks like I have an admirer.

11:06.613 --> 11:08.563
Phillip!

11:08.613 --> 11:09.563
What?

11:09.613 --> 11:11.563
Phil! Eyes on us! Front and centre.

11:11.613 --> 11:13.563
Tell us about the PM report.
Yeah.

11:13.613 --> 11:15.563
What about time of death?

11:15.613 --> 11:18.563
Three weeks, give or take.

11:18.613 --> 11:21.613
And this is where our
creepy crawlies come in.

11:22.613 --> 11:25.613
Three different types of insect
were found in the remains.

11:26.613 --> 11:30.563
Yes, I know, but, er...
we're all just insect feed in the end.

11:30.613 --> 11:32.613
Oh, cheery!

11:35.613 --> 11:38.563
Right, well, er, time for a tinkle.

11:38.613 --> 11:40.613
Phil.
Phillip! No!

11:42.613 --> 11:43.713
Oh, ye of little faith.

12:03.613 --> 12:07.563
Hi, Dad, Syd, this is Phil.
Phil, this is Dad and Syd.

12:07.613 --> 12:11.563
Oh, my God, you've got a gay dad.
How fantastic.

12:11.613 --> 12:12.563
Hiya.

12:12.613 --> 12:15.563
Come in.
Hi. Hey, Syd.

12:15.613 --> 12:18.563
Nice to meet you.
Pleased to meet you. Hello.

12:18.613 --> 12:20.613
Phil, great to see you.

12:39.613 --> 12:40.563
Oh, cheers.

12:40.613 --> 12:42.563
There you go. There you go.

12:42.613 --> 12:44.563
Ah, nice and cool.

12:44.613 --> 12:47.563
Piercings. You guys have piercings.

12:47.613 --> 12:50.563
I could never have piercings.
Scared of the pain.

12:50.613 --> 12:52.563
It's the pain that
enhances the pleasure,

12:52.613 --> 12:54.563
if you have it in the right place.

12:54.613 --> 12:56.563
Interesting job you got.

12:56.613 --> 12:59.563
Oh, yeah,
hanging out with dead people all day.

12:59.613 --> 13:03.563
Yes, well, it pays very well but
the conversation's often lacking.

13:03.613 --> 13:06.563
It's amazing what they can do now,
with all this tech.

13:06.613 --> 13:09.563
I suppose you got to be smart
these days to be a criminal.

13:09.613 --> 13:13.713
You just need a detective with a massive
ego who's happy to bang up the wrong person.

13:15.613 --> 13:16.613
Cheers, everyone.

13:20.613 --> 13:22.563
It's been a long day.

13:22.613 --> 13:24.563
Oh, come on,
the party's just getting started.

13:24.613 --> 13:27.563
Oh, you'll be fine without me. Have fun.

13:27.613 --> 13:29.613
Night.
Night.

13:34.613 --> 13:37.613
Right, let's crack out the poppers!

15:23.613 --> 15:25.563
What do you think's going on?

15:25.613 --> 15:29.563
I've no idea. But I think it's got
something to do with this place.

15:29.613 --> 15:31.563
I mean, who leaves and never comes back?
Never?

15:31.613 --> 15:34.563
Her father lives here,
her sister visits.

15:34.613 --> 15:37.563
Yeah, yes, the labyrinthine
maze that is Helen's psyche.

15:37.613 --> 15:39.613
Oof!

15:41.613 --> 15:42.563
Bollocks!

15:42.613 --> 15:45.613
God love the countryside.

15:48.613 --> 15:52.563
So let's assume she wasn't
dead three or four weeks.

15:52.613 --> 15:54.613
In fact, nothing like four weeks.

15:56.613 --> 16:00.563
How do you make a body that's
actually relatively fresh

16:00.613 --> 16:03.563
look as though it's
been rotting for a while?

16:03.613 --> 16:05.613
Well, never mind how... why?

16:06.613 --> 16:09.563
Well, to falsify the time of death,
I imagine,

16:09.613 --> 16:13.563
but in that case... why burn the body?

16:13.613 --> 16:16.563
Well, I was hoping you'd have an answer.

16:16.613 --> 16:21.613
Well, it's just a theory,
but, er, to open it up.

16:23.613 --> 16:29.613
I think he burned the body
just enough to open it up.

16:30.613 --> 16:32.613
For what?

16:34.613 --> 16:36.613
To put the bugs in.

17:29.613 --> 17:32.563
OK, so, I'm him, I'm the killer, right?

17:32.613 --> 17:35.563
Oh, dear.
Hell of a twist, but let's go with it.

17:35.613 --> 17:40.563
I burn the body, open up the skin,
expose the muscles, organs,

17:40.613 --> 17:41.563
whatever...

17:41.613 --> 17:46.563
Yeah. Transfer your colony across,
wrap it all up in a bag, job done.

17:46.613 --> 17:47.563
Not forgetting to put the fag end in

17:47.613 --> 17:49.563
with Stephen Bates's DNA all over it.

17:49.613 --> 17:51.563
Yes. Wherever you managed
to acquire that from.

17:51.613 --> 17:54.563
Maybe I followed him,
watched him drop it in the gutter.

17:54.613 --> 17:56.563
There you go, love.
Thanks, love.

17:56.613 --> 17:57.613
Possibly.

17:58.613 --> 18:01.563
Right, so,
where does he get them all from?

18:01.613 --> 18:03.563
All these flies, maggots,
different kinds of beetles.

18:03.613 --> 18:05.563
Internet?

18:05.613 --> 18:06.563
I've checked his history.

18:06.613 --> 18:08.563
Oh... Dark web? Bitcoin?

18:08.613 --> 18:11.563
Normal people don't know how to use that.
I do.

18:11.613 --> 18:12.563
You're not normal.

18:17.613 --> 18:18.563
Thought it was you.

18:18.613 --> 18:19.563
Gavin.

18:19.613 --> 18:22.563
This is, er, Phil... he's a
colleague of mine from Manchester.

18:22.613 --> 18:24.563
You bringing the whole force down?

18:24.613 --> 18:27.563
You know this used to be a nice town,
before all this!

18:27.613 --> 18:29.913
Now all we've got are
pigs and hacks everywhere.

18:31.613 --> 18:33.563
Ah, he seems like a nice chap!

18:33.613 --> 18:36.563
You really ought to get us
together for dinner some time.

18:36.613 --> 18:40.563
Yeah, but he's right, though, isn't he?
What are we doing here?

18:40.613 --> 18:42.563
Well, you're here for Helen.

18:42.613 --> 18:46.563
And I'm here to escape a large
Nigerian man named Reuben

18:46.613 --> 18:48.713
who seems to think we're
in a relationship.

18:54.613 --> 18:56.563
Are we being followed?

18:56.613 --> 18:57.613
Relax.

19:14.613 --> 19:15.563
How's Stephen?

19:15.613 --> 19:18.613
Better... he's out of hospital.

19:20.613 --> 19:23.613
They still won't let me see him,
though, or the kids.

19:24.613 --> 19:26.563
It's killing 'em.

19:26.613 --> 19:28.613
I know.

19:30.613 --> 19:32.563
They shouldn't have to go through this,

19:32.613 --> 19:36.613
because it's hard for them to
accept this hate towards him.

19:37.613 --> 19:40.613
It's the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

19:42.613 --> 19:45.613
Is it... the worst?

19:52.613 --> 19:55.613
I feel so guilty, Linda, for leaving.

19:57.613 --> 19:59.563
It's a long time ago.

19:59.613 --> 20:00.563
I was a coward.

20:00.613 --> 20:02.563
That's shit.

20:02.613 --> 20:05.563
You had the chance and you got out,
and if I...

20:05.613 --> 20:09.563
God, if I'd've had that same chance
I would've done exactly the same.

20:09.613 --> 20:11.563
I thought you'd hate me.

20:11.613 --> 20:14.613
I was scared to death coming down here,
I thought you'd...

20:16.613 --> 20:17.563
Yes?

20:17.613 --> 20:19.563
Oh!

20:19.613 --> 20:22.563
Sorry for staring.

20:22.613 --> 20:25.563
I'm sorry... we're in the middle
of something here, private, so...

20:25.613 --> 20:30.563
Oh, I just wanted to say, Linda,
I know who you are and I understand.

20:30.613 --> 20:32.563
Thank you.

20:32.613 --> 20:34.613
And if you ever want to talk...

20:38.613 --> 20:40.563
I appreciate it.

20:40.613 --> 20:42.563
Which paper are you from?

20:42.613 --> 20:44.563
I beg your pardon?

20:44.613 --> 20:46.563
Which newspaper?

20:46.613 --> 20:47.199
All right.

20:47.399 --> 20:50.563
Last chance, before I really hurt you.
What newspaper?

20:50.613 --> 20:52.563
The-The Post!

20:52.613 --> 20:55.563
Right. Why don't... We'll pay
you... to tell your side of the story.

20:55.613 --> 20:56.563
Why don't you get out of here

20:56.613 --> 20:59.713
before I shove those stupid
glasses up your bony tabloid arse?

21:07.613 --> 21:09.613
Scum.

21:22.613 --> 21:25.613
"Bony tabloid arse"?

21:29.613 --> 21:31.613
You're a good friend.

21:34.613 --> 21:37.563
No, I...

21:37.613 --> 21:38.713
and I never blamed you.

21:42.613 --> 21:43.713
We were both victims.

21:46.613 --> 21:47.613
But...

21:50.613 --> 21:52.563
it's because of me.

21:52.613 --> 21:54.563
He got to you through me.

21:54.613 --> 21:55.613
No.

21:56.613 --> 22:02.613
We were 13 years old.
We were little girls.

23:13.613 --> 23:16.563
Adam knows. It's all going to come out,

23:16.613 --> 23:18.563
and if it isn't me that tells Paul

23:18.613 --> 23:20.563
it's going to be ten times worse...
terminal.

23:20.613 --> 23:21.563
Who told Adam?

23:21.613 --> 23:22.563
Some prick at work, Mickey.

23:22.613 --> 23:23.530
Well, how does he know?

23:23.730 --> 23:25.563
Oh, he's the one who
drove me to the hospital.

23:25.613 --> 23:27.563
Jen, I'm going to tell him tonight.
No, no, no, no, no.

23:27.613 --> 23:29.563
No, listen, don't interrupt.

23:29.613 --> 23:31.563
If it all blows up,

23:31.613 --> 23:33.563
I'm going to need somewhere
to stay for a few days.

23:33.613 --> 23:36.563
Yeah, of course, but you're
going to tear your life apart,

23:36.613 --> 23:39.113
throw everything away,
and he doesn't need to know.

23:44.613 --> 23:46.563
God, you're gorgeous.

23:46.613 --> 23:48.563
I'm trying to belch.

23:48.613 --> 23:50.613
Yeah, I know,
that's when I like you best.

23:52.613 --> 23:55.563
So, where are you taking me tonight,
then?

23:55.613 --> 23:58.563
Thought we'd try this new
vegetarian place, Green Tomato.

23:58.613 --> 24:02.563
Oh, right, OK, town famous for its
pork and you want to go veggie!

24:02.613 --> 24:04.563
Shouldn't we invite Phil? I mean,

24:04.613 --> 24:07.563
isn't it a bit rude to leave
him back with your dad and Syd?

24:07.613 --> 24:09.563
No, it's Phil, he'll be fine.

24:09.613 --> 24:12.563
He was amazing yesterday, you know.

24:12.613 --> 24:14.613
He's got a brain the size of a planet.

24:16.613 --> 24:18.563
So he thinks it's all about the insects,
does he?

24:18.613 --> 24:21.563
Yeah, yeah, placed inside the body.

24:21.613 --> 24:24.563
It would require some
pretty specialist knowledge,

24:24.613 --> 24:26.563
I mean, let alone where you'd
actually acquire them from.

24:26.613 --> 24:28.563
A layman just wouldn't know that stuff.

24:28.613 --> 24:29.613
Shit.

24:31.613 --> 24:32.563
Pig farms.

24:32.613 --> 24:34.563
You what?

24:34.613 --> 24:37.563
The killer wouldn't need to buy
the bugs, he could harvest them.

24:37.613 --> 24:40.563
Right,
I spent some time on farms growing up.

24:40.613 --> 24:43.563
What happens when you let
an animal corpse decompose?

24:43.613 --> 24:45.563
Flies. They feed on it
and they lay their eggs

24:45.613 --> 24:48.563
and that is when the beetles and
the maggots make their appearance.

24:48.613 --> 24:50.563
Oh, shit!

24:50.613 --> 24:53.563
That's it...
the weird farmer, the guy in the bar,

24:53.613 --> 24:55.563
accusing everyone of
stealing his piglets.

24:55.613 --> 24:57.563
Mad Bob.
Right, OK, we should go down there.

24:57.613 --> 25:00.613
Well, what about dinner?
Oh, I've lost my appetite. Ring Phil.

25:12.613 --> 25:14.563
Ah, pigs!

25:14.613 --> 25:16.563
I do love pigs, me!

25:16.613 --> 25:18.563
I say pigs, I mean sausages.

25:18.613 --> 25:22.563
Wonderful animals, pigs.
They're cleverer than dogs.

25:22.613 --> 25:25.563
So, er...
why don't we have, er, guide pigs?

25:25.613 --> 25:27.563
We could... easily.

25:27.613 --> 25:28.563
Sniffer pigs?

25:28.613 --> 25:31.563
OK, right, OK, we're getting off topic.
Can we ask you

25:31.613 --> 25:35.563
some questions about the piglet
that you-you think was stolen?

25:35.613 --> 25:39.563
Don't think. It was. Didn't just
disappear into thin air, did it?

25:39.613 --> 25:40.563
Want a description?

25:40.613 --> 25:43.563
Oh, no, I think-I think we
know what a pig looks like.

25:43.613 --> 25:45.613
Know what a Saddleback looks like?

25:48.613 --> 25:49.563
Thought not.

25:49.613 --> 25:51.563
This isn't a big operation.

25:51.613 --> 25:53.563
And you say it happened overnight, yeah?

25:53.613 --> 25:55.563
Well, it was there last
time I changed the feed,

25:55.613 --> 25:56.563
gone the next morning.

25:56.613 --> 25:59.563
You don't have electric fences,
anything like that?

25:59.613 --> 26:02.563
Nope. Have I seen you somewhere before?

26:02.613 --> 26:03.563
Er, yeah, yeah, at the pub...

26:03.613 --> 26:06.563
you came in accusing Trevor,
the landlord.

26:06.613 --> 26:09.563
Could be him, easy,
amount of pork he serves,

26:09.613 --> 26:13.563
and that cook he's got, Shelley,
cut-price bloody Shakespeare...

26:13.613 --> 26:18.563
if he's such a good poet,
why's he cooking sausages?

26:18.613 --> 26:24.563
Yes. What I don't fully understand
is that, well, you, er, clearly love

26:24.613 --> 26:30.563
your pigs, so how do you handle
them being, you know, slaughtered?

26:30.613 --> 26:34.563
Love 'em? They're money!

26:34.613 --> 26:37.613
Somebody steals my pigs,
it's like mugging me in the street.

26:38.613 --> 26:42.613
Well, thank you very much.

26:44.613 --> 26:48.613
We'll let you know if we hear anything.

26:53.613 --> 26:57.563
Why would someone go to all
that trouble to implicate Bates?

26:57.613 --> 27:00.563
Well, so that everyone thinks
that Bates is the killer,

27:00.613 --> 27:02.563
which is exactly what
the real killer wants.

27:02.613 --> 27:05.563
But he can't get away
with killing a second time,

27:05.613 --> 27:06.563
not with Bates in custody.

27:06.613 --> 27:09.563
So what are you saying?
You think Poppy's still alive?

27:09.613 --> 27:12.613
I think she might be, yeah.
I think it's possible.

27:21.613 --> 27:23.563
That was your lovely friend.

27:23.613 --> 27:24.563
Gavin.

27:24.613 --> 27:25.563
Shall we follow him?

27:25.613 --> 27:27.563
On what grounds?
Ah, fun.

27:27.613 --> 27:29.563
He's been acting suspicious...

27:29.613 --> 27:31.563
he was parked up by the
woods the other night.

27:31.613 --> 27:35.563
Eh, what? Are we actually doing this,
guys? What if he sees us?

27:35.613 --> 27:37.563
Oh, we will claim coincidence.

27:37.613 --> 27:39.563
Mm-hm. Come on.

27:39.613 --> 27:41.563
All right! Fine!

27:41.613 --> 27:43.563
There he is.

27:43.613 --> 27:45.563
Isn't this fun?

27:45.613 --> 27:47.613
Yeah, that's him!

28:08.613 --> 28:09.563
What the hell is he doing?

28:09.613 --> 28:11.613
Only one way to find out.

28:13.613 --> 28:15.563
Hey, listen,
just remember you're pregnant,

28:15.613 --> 28:17.613
all right, so if it kicks off,
leave it to us.

28:31.613 --> 28:32.563
All right, so now what?

28:32.613 --> 28:33.563
Right, we follow him inside,

28:33.613 --> 28:35.286
but one of us goes round
the side in case he bolts.

28:35.386 --> 28:36.613
I'll go.

28:50.613 --> 28:52.613
Wait here.

28:57.613 --> 28:58.613
Shit!

29:08.613 --> 29:11.613
I've got him! I've got him!

29:12.613 --> 29:14.613
OK, OK...

29:16.613 --> 29:18.563
Look, it was just a bit of robbing.

29:18.613 --> 29:20.563
They're insured.

29:20.613 --> 29:22.563
It's the Poppy and Abi show, isn't it?

29:22.613 --> 29:24.563
Everyone's making a nice
bit of coin out of it.

29:24.613 --> 29:26.563
Oh, you should be ashamed of yourself.

29:26.613 --> 29:28.613
Yeah, well, thanks for that,
school bully.

29:31.613 --> 29:33.613
Helen! Helen!

29:34.613 --> 29:37.563
You, you don't know anything about me,
or anything about my life

29:37.613 --> 29:40.613
back then, so why don't you
just shut your stupid trap?

30:48.613 --> 30:50.563
I've got to go back up to Manchester.

30:50.613 --> 30:52.563
I was working on.

30:52.613 --> 30:55.613
Can you stay tonight and
go back tomorrow morning?

30:56.613 --> 30:59.563
Maybe we could have
dinner tonight together.

30:59.613 --> 31:01.613
Is everything all right?

31:02.613 --> 31:05.613
Hey, what's wrong?

31:08.613 --> 31:10.713
Look, Helen, whatever it is,
just spit it out.

31:21.613 --> 31:23.563
Just don't think I'm
ready to be a mother.

31:23.613 --> 31:27.563
Y'know, coming back here and
seeing all this pain and anguish,

31:27.613 --> 31:30.563
it's like people make themselves
vulnerable just by having kids,

31:30.613 --> 31:32.563
just by loving something that much.

31:32.613 --> 31:37.563
What's the alternative? Hey? Close
your heart to risk never being hurt?

31:37.613 --> 31:38.563
I need the loo.

31:38.613 --> 31:39.563
You've just been!

31:39.613 --> 31:42.113
Yeah, but I've got a baby
pressing down on my bladder!

31:55.613 --> 31:58.563
I saw your picture in the paper.

31:58.613 --> 32:00.563
Right.

32:00.613 --> 32:02.113
You're a friend of Linda Bates.

32:03.613 --> 32:04.613
And?

32:06.613 --> 32:07.613
Can we talk?

32:08.613 --> 32:10.613
Yeah. I'm coming out.

32:20.613 --> 32:22.563
This is a bit of a nightmare, actually,

32:22.613 --> 32:23.563
you being a friend of Steve's wife,

32:23.613 --> 32:26.563
but I'm hoping you'll help me.

32:26.613 --> 32:28.613
Help you?

32:29.613 --> 32:31.613
Prove he didn't kill anyone.

32:37.613 --> 32:39.613
Why do you think he didn't kill anyone?

32:40.613 --> 32:42.613
Because...

32:43.613 --> 32:46.563
that night everyone
reckons he took Abigail Toms,

32:46.613 --> 32:47.563
he was with me.

32:47.613 --> 32:50.613
It was me he was meeting in that pub.

32:51.613 --> 32:53.563
So you, you and Steve,
you were together?

32:53.613 --> 32:55.563
Yeah.

32:55.613 --> 32:59.563
We had to meet in places
a bit out the way.

32:59.613 --> 33:01.563
So you have an alibi for him?

33:01.613 --> 33:03.563
Well, sort of.

33:03.613 --> 33:06.563
He didn't have time to get back
to Polesford and kill someone.

33:06.613 --> 33:08.613
Well, why not go to the police?

33:10.613 --> 33:11.613
I'm only 16.

33:16.613 --> 33:18.613
How long have you been
seeing each other?

33:21.613 --> 33:25.613
We didn't do anything, you know,
sexual, not until my birthday.

33:27.613 --> 33:30.563
He wouldn't. We kissed, but he didn't...

33:30.613 --> 33:32.563
OK, there's no... no need to get upset.

33:32.613 --> 33:36.563
I'm shitting myself,
cos you know what they'll say,

33:36.613 --> 33:40.563
they'll say, "Well, there you are,
then, he was into young girls,

33:40.613 --> 33:43.563
"it's proof, he did it with
Abigail and Poppy as well,

33:43.613 --> 33:46.563
"but he killed them...
you could've been next,"

33:46.613 --> 33:48.563
but that's crap, he's not like that.

33:48.613 --> 33:56.563
OK, I understand, but you know we
need to take this to the police?

33:56.613 --> 33:57.563
What did you say your name was again?

33:57.613 --> 34:00.613
Ro... Rory Harcross.

34:01.613 --> 34:04.563
Well, Aurora.

34:04.613 --> 34:06.563
Blame my parents.

34:06.613 --> 34:08.612
Harcross?

34:12.612 --> 34:15.612
Oh, God, I need some air.
I'm pregnant. I'm sorry.

34:48.612 --> 34:49.612
Argh!

34:54.612 --> 34:56.612
You learn some respect.

35:05.613 --> 35:07.613
Don't be scared. He's fine.

35:22.613 --> 35:26.563
always meet outside of Polesford...

35:26.613 --> 35:27.563
the night Abi was taken...

35:27.613 --> 35:29.563
You don't believe her, do you?

35:29.613 --> 35:30.563
No. I don't.

35:30.613 --> 35:34.563
Why? Because it means you're wrong?
Why would she lie?

35:34.613 --> 35:36.563
What's she got to gain?

35:36.613 --> 35:39.563
She's got text after
text proving the affair.

35:39.613 --> 35:41.563
She gives Bates a rock-solid alibi

35:41.613 --> 35:43.563
for the time you've got him
murdering Abigail Toms.

35:43.613 --> 35:46.563
You're determined to prove me wrong,
aren't you?

35:46.613 --> 35:48.563
Oh, my God.

35:48.613 --> 35:50.563
It's not about you.

35:50.613 --> 35:54.563
Why don't you see what's staring
you straight in the face?

35:54.613 --> 35:56.563
You will not be the star
of this investigation

35:56.613 --> 35:58.613
if you convict an innocent man.

35:59.613 --> 36:03.563
Would you rather she take her
story straight to the papers?

36:03.613 --> 36:07.563
Fine. I'll take it once round the block.

36:07.613 --> 36:10.563
Ah, by the way, your mate Linda's here.

36:10.613 --> 36:12.613
Would you like to be
the one to tell her?

36:19.613 --> 36:24.563
She's lying. Polesford's full
of little bitches like that.

36:24.613 --> 36:25.563
I don't think so.

36:25.613 --> 36:27.613
Oh, and you'd know, would you?

36:28.613 --> 36:32.613
I know it can't be easy to hear,
but it can't hurt to have an alibi.

36:33.613 --> 36:34.613
Can't hurt?

36:37.613 --> 36:41.563
How would you feel if
some little slut came along

36:41.613 --> 36:44.563
saying she was screwing your Paul,
saying she loved him?

36:44.613 --> 36:46.563
I would be upset.

36:46.613 --> 36:50.563
But given these
particular circumstances,

36:50.613 --> 36:53.613
I would rather he was a
shagger than a killer.

36:57.613 --> 36:59.563
What am I going to tell the kids?

36:59.613 --> 37:00.563
I don't know.

37:00.613 --> 37:02.563
How can we tell Charli I
know her stepdad's innocent

37:02.613 --> 37:05.613
cos he was with a girl
younger than she is?

37:06.613 --> 37:09.613
What's she like? Is she pretty?

37:12.613 --> 37:13.563
She's young.

37:13.613 --> 37:16.613
Hm. Firm tits? Slim waist?

37:18.613 --> 37:20.613
Know your enemy.

37:23.613 --> 37:26.613
We learned that a long time ago,
didn't we?

37:29.613 --> 37:31.613
Who is she?

37:34.613 --> 37:39.613
Helen, please tell me, what's her name?

37:45.613 --> 37:47.613
You don't want to know.

37:58.613 --> 38:01.563
I s'pose that's why I
never came forward earlier,

38:01.613 --> 38:03.563
because I knew they wouldn't believe me.

38:03.613 --> 38:07.613
They'll investigate.
I'll make sure they do.

38:11.613 --> 38:14.563
I knew her. Abi.

38:14.613 --> 38:17.563
Went out together a few times.

38:17.613 --> 38:20.613
Bonded when we found out
we had matching rose tats.

38:21.613 --> 38:25.563
Tit tats, she called 'em,
because they were...

38:25.613 --> 38:28.613
you know... there.

38:31.613 --> 38:34.613
I can't believe she's dead.

38:38.613 --> 38:40.613
Thanks, anyway.

38:48.613 --> 38:50.563
Gosh...

38:50.613 --> 38:51.613
Aurora?

38:53.613 --> 38:57.563
Who, erm,
who lives with you in that house?

38:57.613 --> 38:58.563
My-my dad... why?

38:58.613 --> 39:01.613
Do you ever see your grandad?

39:04.613 --> 39:08.613
He lives in Hull,
big deal on the council over there. Why?

39:10.613 --> 39:11.613
I used to know him.

39:13.613 --> 39:14.613
Bye.

39:30.613 --> 39:33.147
Are you going to tell me
what this is all about?

39:33.347 --> 39:33.563
No.

39:33.613 --> 39:34.563
Oh, for God's sake, Helen!

39:34.613 --> 39:38.563
You've been weird ever since we
came down here. There's something.

39:38.613 --> 39:39.563
I know there's something.

39:39.613 --> 39:41.563
I don't want to discuss it.

39:41.613 --> 39:44.563
We're having a child together,
Helen, in case you'd forgotten...

39:44.613 --> 39:48.563
I think that bonds us pretty tightly,
don't you, so if there's

39:48.613 --> 39:51.713
any secrets, if there's something
that you're not telling me...

39:55.613 --> 39:57.613
Helen!

39:58.613 --> 39:59.613
Helen! Helen!

40:00.613 --> 40:02.563
Helen!

40:02.613 --> 40:06.563
Helen, Helen, stop! STOP!

40:06.613 --> 40:09.563
I was abused. Raped.
Is that what you want to hear?

40:09.613 --> 40:12.563
I was 13 years old and his
name was Peter Harcross.

40:12.613 --> 40:13.563
Harcross?

40:13.613 --> 40:14.563
Yeah, him.

40:14.613 --> 40:17.563
He was a friend of my dad's
and my dad was a single father

40:17.613 --> 40:19.563
and my mum had died and my
dad didn't know how to cope

40:19.613 --> 40:21.563
and Peter pretended to be a helping hand

40:21.613 --> 40:24.563
and he knew that my dad was gay,
and he used that against me.

40:24.613 --> 40:27.563
He said if I ever told
anyone he would ruin him...

40:27.613 --> 40:29.563
he would make sure that everyone knew,
and he was a councillor

40:29.613 --> 40:32.563
and my dad was still
in the closet back then.

40:32.613 --> 40:35.613
Hey!
And it... You know, it wasn't just me.

40:36.613 --> 40:41.563
It was Linda as well.
He got to her through me.

40:41.613 --> 40:43.563
Helen, come here!

40:43.613 --> 40:44.613
No.

40:47.613 --> 40:50.563
He wanted Jenny. I know he did.

40:50.613 --> 40:52.563
He would turn up at the house

40:52.613 --> 40:55.563
and he would pretend to be
surprised that my dad wasn't in.

40:55.613 --> 40:58.563
He would help himself to a beer
and he would sit down next to me

40:58.613 --> 41:02.563
and he would rub my leg
and-and I was so shit scared

41:02.613 --> 41:05.563
that she would be next and I swore,
I swore that I would never...

41:05.613 --> 41:09.563
I'd never let him get to her
and he said... he said that

41:09.613 --> 41:12.563
I had to keep loving him
or he'd try someone else,

41:12.613 --> 41:14.563
and I knew he meant her.

41:14.613 --> 41:17.563
That's how he would describe it.

41:17.613 --> 41:19.563
"Loving him."

41:19.613 --> 41:24.563
Like-like loving means lying
still like you're dead

41:24.613 --> 41:28.563
and throwing your guts
up after then running home

41:28.613 --> 41:31.613
so fast you can't feel
your legs any more.

41:33.613 --> 41:35.613
And Paula...

41:37.613 --> 41:39.613
Paula...

41:40.613 --> 41:42.613
Paula calls me a bully.

41:43.613 --> 41:45.613
I was looking after them.

41:46.613 --> 41:50.613
I was a bitch to her and Jenny
because I was trying to protect them.

41:53.613 --> 41:55.613
Like I hadn't with Linda.

41:59.613 --> 42:03.563
And it's ruined our lives, you know,

42:03.613 --> 42:09.563
because it... it never leaves you,
it never leaves you, not really,

42:09.613 --> 42:15.563
it's fucking in here...
Every relationship,

42:15.613 --> 42:19.563
every fucking relationship
I have ever had, I have...

42:19.613 --> 42:23.563
I have fucked up and it's...
it's him that's to blame...

42:23.613 --> 42:25.563
the filthy fucking bastard.

42:25.613 --> 42:27.563
Hey, hey, no.

42:27.613 --> 42:28.613
No.

42:30.613 --> 42:34.613
Helen, Helen, Helen,
look at me, look at me.

42:36.613 --> 42:41.613
Hey, you haven't fucked
up every relationship, OK?

42:42.613 --> 42:45.613
You've got me. You've still got me.

42:51.613 --> 42:52.613
Not for long.

42:54.613 --> 42:56.613
What do you mean?

42:58.613 --> 43:00.613
What're you saying, Helen?

43:02.613 --> 43:05.613
I slept with someone.

43:07.613 --> 43:08.563
Adam Perrin.

43:08.613 --> 43:12.563
And-and it didn't mean anything much,
it was just screwing, but...

43:12.613 --> 43:13.563
Fuck!

43:13.613 --> 43:16.563
And don't ask me for reasons,
because I've got none.

43:16.613 --> 43:19.563
He was there and I fancied him and
I knew it would mess everything up

43:19.613 --> 43:21.563
but I didn't stop myself

43:21.613 --> 43:24.613
because I couldn't,
like I have never been able to.

43:28.613 --> 43:30.613
The baby...

43:32.613 --> 43:33.563
Tell me it's not his.

43:33.613 --> 43:36.613
Helen, tell me.

43:37.613 --> 43:38.563
I don't know.

43:38.613 --> 43:40.613
Oh, shit!

43:41.613 --> 43:46.563
I really don't. It could be his,
Paul, or it could be yours.

43:46.613 --> 43:50.563
How could you do this to me?
How could you?

43:50.613 --> 43:54.613
Why? Why would you do this to me?

43:55.613 --> 44:00.613
Because it's who I am and I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

44:05.613 --> 44:08.563
Adam Perrin?

44:08.613 --> 44:09.613
I'm sorry.

44:12.613 --> 44:14.563
I've got to go back to Manchester.

44:14.613 --> 44:15.563
No, Paul...

44:15.613 --> 44:17.563
You don't have any say any more.
No, Paul, Paul, please!

44:17.613 --> 44:19.563
Just leave me alone!

44:19.613 --> 44:21.613
Please... just... stay...

45:16.613 --> 45:19.563
'Tit tats,
she called them cos they were...'

45:19.613 --> 45:21.563
you know...

45:21.613 --> 45:23.613
there.

45:45.613 --> 45:47.563
What!

45:47.613 --> 45:49.563
Paul, Paul, I know...

45:49.613 --> 45:50.563
I know who killed Abigail Toms.

45:50.613 --> 45:53.613
It's Trevor. Trevor Hare.
I'll meet you at the pub.

46:02.613 --> 46:04.563
'Lovely girl, that Abigail.'

46:04.613 --> 46:08.563
She had one of them stupid tattoos
they all have... huge rose.

46:08.613 --> 46:10.613
'That's like goody
two shoes round here.'

46:21.613 --> 46:23.563
Where's Trevor?

46:23.613 --> 46:24.563
Where is he?
I don't know!

46:24.613 --> 46:26.563
You can't go up there!

46:26.613 --> 46:27.613
I'm police!
You can't!

46:51.613 --> 46:52.613
Helen!

46:59.613 --> 47:01.563
Right,
he's heading for the lower villages,

47:01.613 --> 47:04.613
and there's only one road there,
so I think we could catch him.

47:05.613 --> 47:09.563
Trevor knew about Abigail's tattoo.

47:09.613 --> 47:13.563
It's the same as Rory's. They both
had that rose in private places.

47:13.613 --> 47:16.563
Plus,
he's ex-police so he knows all about DNA

47:16.613 --> 47:17.563
and time of death scenarios.

47:17.613 --> 47:19.563
And he's had all the coppers in his pub

47:19.613 --> 47:21.563
so he's had the inside
track on everything.

47:21.613 --> 47:23.563
Hiding in plain sight.

47:23.613 --> 47:25.563
More than that... flaunting it.

47:25.613 --> 47:28.563
Telling people he used to give
Abigail and Poppy lifts in his car,

47:28.613 --> 47:29.563
and it explains the fag end, too.

47:29.613 --> 47:31.563
From the beer garden?
He knew Bates.

47:31.613 --> 47:34.563
He knew exactly what
he was up to with Rory,

47:34.613 --> 47:36.013
and knew he could set him up.

47:38.613 --> 47:40.613
There he is.

47:43.613 --> 47:45.613
I love you.

48:03.613 --> 48:07.563
I know this road,
I know where he's going.

48:07.613 --> 48:09.613
To the old pumping station.

48:42.613 --> 48:44.613
Come on, it's this way.

48:54.613 --> 48:56.563
You OK?

48:56.613 --> 48:57.613
Yeah, it's not far.

48:58.613 --> 49:01.563
Why the hell didn't they search
this place when they first came?

49:01.613 --> 49:03.613
Probably under five foot of water.

49:27.613 --> 49:29.613
Helen, be careful.

49:43.613 --> 49:44.563
Oh, God.

49:44.613 --> 49:46.563
Trevor!

49:46.613 --> 49:47.613
Stop!

49:50.613 --> 49:52.563
You shouldn't've come here.

49:52.613 --> 49:55.563
You've put me in a terrible position.

49:55.613 --> 49:57.563
Because now there aren't many options.

49:57.613 --> 50:01.563
You don't want to kill her, Trevor.
Kill her?

50:01.613 --> 50:02.613
I love her.

50:05.613 --> 50:08.613
You let us go or I will kill her.

50:09.613 --> 50:13.563
You try and stop me and I will kill you.

50:13.613 --> 50:17.563
Where are you going to go?
Live on a little island? It's over.

50:17.613 --> 50:18.563
It's all over, Trevor.

50:18.613 --> 50:21.613
No, it's not.

50:34.613 --> 50:36.613
You OK?

50:59.613 --> 51:00.563
Watch out!

52:01.613 --> 52:02.563
It's my fault.

52:02.613 --> 52:05.563
No! No, no, no, it isn't.

52:05.613 --> 52:06.813
He was my friend, that...

52:09.613 --> 52:11.613
My little girl.

52:13.613 --> 52:15.613
My little girl.

52:18.613 --> 52:20.613
I'm so sorry.

52:21.613 --> 52:23.613
I'm so, sorry.

53:27.613 --> 53:28.613
Yeah? One sec...

53:30.613 --> 53:32.563
You're not supposed to be here

53:32.613 --> 53:34.563
until after the Trevor
Hare investigation.

53:34.613 --> 53:36.563
Yeah, I'm not here for that.

53:36.613 --> 53:38.613
I'm here for something else.

53:48.613 --> 53:51.563
I want to report a historic
case of child abuse.

53:51.613 --> 53:53.563
Against who?

53:53.613 --> 53:54.613
Me.

54:00.613 --> 54:02.563
How historic?

54:02.613 --> 54:03.563
20-odd years ago.

54:03.613 --> 54:05.613
And the perpetrator?

54:06.613 --> 54:08.563
Peter Harcross.

54:08.613 --> 54:13.563
He was a local councillor in
my hometown, works in Hull now,

54:13.613 --> 54:14.563
few years off retirement.

54:14.613 --> 54:16.563
Local government?

54:16.613 --> 54:17.613
Mm-hm.

54:21.613 --> 54:23.813
This'll get attention.
I want him done for it.

54:28.613 --> 54:30.613
I'm so sorry you've
had to live with this.

54:34.613 --> 54:35.613
You've seen me...

54:37.613 --> 54:40.613
drug dealers, criminals,
I can stand up to them...

54:43.613 --> 54:45.613
but...

54:47.613 --> 54:48.613
that man...

55:31.613 --> 55:34.563
Paul, please... please come home.

55:34.613 --> 55:37.563
Let's-let's at least try?

55:37.613 --> 55:40.613
Do you know, Helen,
right now I can't even look at you.

56:23.613 --> 56:26.563
Mikey, I've got a problem.

56:26.613 --> 56:28.563
They're going to kill us!
They'll kill us all!

56:28.613 --> 56:30.563
Right, we're going to find
who did it and hit back.

56:30.613 --> 56:32.313
The business carries on as usual.

56:32.613 --> 56:37.563
Every time he looks at me it's like I've
got "whore" written across my forehead.

56:37.613 --> 56:38.563
You want a relationship with a woman

56:38.613 --> 56:41.563
who doesn't even know who the father is?
Well, I love you.

56:41.613 --> 56:43.563
Stay away from Frank Linnell.

56:43.613 --> 56:46.563
I've got a bit of a reputation.
Some people see me a certain way.

56:46.613 --> 56:47.563
How much blood is there?
