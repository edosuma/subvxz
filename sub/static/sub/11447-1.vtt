01:04.480 --> 01:07.610
Many strange tales
are told of this Jungle...

01:07.776 --> 01:09.653
but none so strange...

01:09.820 --> 01:13.074
as the tale of the cub we call Mowgli.

02:25.270 --> 02:27.898
You must be the very
worst wolf I've ever seen.

02:28.398 --> 02:31.322
Yeah, but if that branch didn't break,
I would've made it.

02:31.860 --> 02:34.329
Crossing upwind,
breaking from your numbers.

02:34.738 --> 02:35.864
If you can't learn to run with the Pack...

02:36.031 --> 02:37.499
one of these days,
you'll be someone's dinner.

02:37.658 --> 02:38.830
- How'd we do?
- Not Mowgli, again.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.541
- He's never gonna make the Council.
- Let's go!

02:41.703 --> 02:43.421
Race you to the top!

02:44.164 --> 02:45.757
It was higher ground.

02:45.916 --> 02:48.089
Wolves don't hide in trees.

02:48.251 --> 02:49.423
I can't keep up with them, Bagheera.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.588
I tried. I just picked the wrong tree.

02:51.755 --> 02:53.098
It was a dead tree.

02:53.548 --> 02:55.596
How was I supposed to know it was dead?

02:55.759 --> 02:56.885
It had a fig vine.

02:57.052 --> 03:00.977
Any tree girdled by a creeper
is either dead or close to it.

03:01.139 --> 03:04.143
- These are things a wolf must know.
- Yeah.

03:04.559 --> 03:07.403
But if the branch didn't break,
I would've made it.

03:07.979 --> 03:12.276
I realise you weren't born a wolf,
but couldn't you at least act like one?

03:16.446 --> 03:19.666
When I found him, many years ago...

03:20.325 --> 03:23.625
he was just an infant,
abandoned in the woods.

03:23.787 --> 03:25.289
Get the deer!

03:26.456 --> 03:28.584
If he was going to survive...

03:29.167 --> 03:31.295
I knew he needed a people.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.259
A people to protect him.

03:34.297 --> 03:37.221
That's why I entrusted him to the wolves.

03:40.595 --> 03:42.268
Look well, wolves.

03:43.807 --> 03:47.027
Akela was a just and noble leader.

03:47.561 --> 03:50.531
He allowed Mowgli to dwell
among them, all those years.

03:53.316 --> 03:56.661
The trouble was, wolves grew so fast...

03:57.154 --> 03:58.371
and Mowgli...

03:58.530 --> 04:01.158
let's just say he liked to take his time.

04:01.324 --> 04:02.496
Mowgli, pick me up high!

04:03.034 --> 04:05.207
- My turn!
- Stop. Not now.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.543
It was Raksha who raised him.

04:07.706 --> 04:09.708
She was the only mother he ever knew

04:10.167 --> 04:12.761
- Come on, let's play!
- I don't feel like playing, Gray.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.967
Come on, you're my brother.
You have to play with me.

04:15.130 --> 04:17.007
Let's go chase some mice.

04:19.301 --> 04:20.974
How did it go?

04:21.636 --> 04:23.138
Caught me again.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.815
If it's meant to be...

04:25.974 --> 04:27.897
it will be.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.187
Let me hear the Law.

04:30.854 --> 04:35.322
"This is the Law of the Jungle,
as old and as true as the sky.

04:35.859 --> 04:37.907
"The Wolf that keeps it will prosper...

04:38.069 --> 04:40.822
"but the Wolf that breaks it will die.

04:40.989 --> 04:43.538
"Like the creeper that girdles
the tree trunk...

04:43.700 --> 04:46.044
"the Law runneth over and back.

04:46.203 --> 04:48.752
"For the strength of the Pack
is the Wolf...

04:48.914 --> 04:52.384
"and the strength of the Wolf
is the Pack."

05:20.904 --> 05:22.906
Soon, the rain ceased to fall

05:22.989 --> 05:24.866
and the dry season arrived.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.298
Heat crept through the Jungle...

05:32.457 --> 05:35.252
turning it yellow, then brown...

05:35.418 --> 05:36.795
then black.

05:39.214 --> 05:40.682
But that year...

05:40.841 --> 05:43.845
was the driest season
that anyone could remember.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.183
Even the mohwa didn't flower.

05:51.977 --> 05:53.069
My leaf.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.652
This is mine. Mine, mine, mine.

05:56.815 --> 05:59.238
There's a rock. That's mud. That's mud.

05:59.401 --> 06:00.869
There's a rock. That's my rock.

06:01.027 --> 06:02.700
That's my rock. Nobody touches my rock.

06:02.863 --> 06:05.286
There's another rock.
Two rocks. Three rocks.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.291
Peace Rock? Peace Rock!

06:08.660 --> 06:10.913
It's the Truce! The Water Truce!

06:11.913 --> 06:14.132
It's the Water Truce!

06:15.417 --> 06:17.090
It had been many, many years

06:17.168 --> 06:19.170
since the Peace Rock was revealed...

06:19.921 --> 06:22.174
and the Water Truce was called.

06:29.639 --> 06:31.808
Hunting at the riverbank
was now forbidden...

06:31.975 --> 06:35.650
because, by Law of the Jungle,
drinking comes before eating.

06:35.812 --> 06:38.907
So, you could come to the Peace Rock,
on a day like this...

06:39.065 --> 06:42.160
and find all people side-by-side.

06:53.788 --> 06:54.789
Don't forget.

06:54.873 --> 06:55.920
No hunting.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.000
Playing only.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.593
Playing, only. I got it, ami.

06:59.085 --> 07:02.805
And remember, not everyone here
has seen a man-cub in the Jungle before.

07:02.964 --> 07:04.341
So, behave yourself.

07:04.799 --> 07:06.392
Okay, can I go now?

07:06.551 --> 07:07.768
Take the pups with you.

07:08.553 --> 07:09.896
Wait for me!

07:10.513 --> 07:11.605
Come on, Gray!

07:12.974 --> 07:13.975
Oh, take a look at this guy.

07:14.935 --> 07:15.936
Excuse me.

07:16.019 --> 07:17.771
Sorry.

07:17.979 --> 07:20.073
- He's walking on two legs.
- Don't stare.

07:20.231 --> 07:21.483
Hey, look. A wild boar.

07:21.650 --> 07:24.028
- And a rhino.
- And a mongoose.

07:24.194 --> 07:25.195
Everybody's here.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.664
Is that a peacock?

07:28.365 --> 07:29.867
- Ooh, a stick!
- Oh, that's my stick.

07:30.033 --> 07:31.501
- I like this stick.
- Seriously, that's my stick.

07:31.660 --> 07:32.707
- This is my stick.
- No, that's my stick!

07:32.869 --> 07:34.371
- Let go of my stick!
- It's a Water Truce!

07:34.537 --> 07:36.710
It's a Water Truce!

07:36.831 --> 07:37.878
Sorry.

07:38.333 --> 07:40.461
My bad! It's involuntary.

07:41.419 --> 07:42.591
I could pee on it.

07:42.754 --> 07:44.301
Watch yourself, please.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.091
Dad, what is that?

07:46.257 --> 07:47.884
I think that's a man-cub.

07:48.051 --> 07:50.053
What's a man-cub doing here?

07:51.638 --> 07:53.231
Whoa. Don't forget the Truce.

07:53.390 --> 07:55.063
I know the Law, bucks.

08:03.108 --> 08:04.451
What is that?

08:17.414 --> 08:18.916
- Weird.
- That's weird.

08:20.458 --> 08:21.459
Mowgli.

08:25.088 --> 08:27.432
What was the rule about your tricks?

08:28.591 --> 08:30.593
It's not the wolf way.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.433
No more tricks.

08:34.931 --> 08:36.274
Chin up, little one.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.025
We'll make you a fine wolf, yet.

08:40.437 --> 08:42.110
What about me? Am I gonna be a fine wolf?

08:42.272 --> 08:43.398
Look at me howl!

08:46.860 --> 08:48.737
In some packs, the runt gets eaten.

08:49.112 --> 08:50.113
Oh...

09:05.670 --> 09:07.138
Mowgli, behind me.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.557
Don't leave my side.

09:57.847 --> 10:02.227
Everyone comes to Peace Rock.
So many smells to catch up on.

10:08.399 --> 10:09.616
But, um...

10:12.946 --> 10:14.539
I can't help but notice...

10:14.948 --> 10:18.202
there's this strange odour today.

10:20.203 --> 10:23.707
What is it, this scent that I'm on?

10:26.042 --> 10:27.294
I almost...

10:28.086 --> 10:30.555
I almost think it was some kind of...

10:31.422 --> 10:32.423
man-cub.

10:34.884 --> 10:38.104
Mowgli belongs to my Pack, Shere Khan.

10:38.555 --> 10:39.556
Mowgli?

10:40.223 --> 10:42.317
They've given it a name.

10:43.226 --> 10:47.902
When was it we came to adopt
man into the Jungle?

10:48.314 --> 10:49.907
He's just a cub.

10:50.358 --> 10:54.363
Does my face not remind you
of what a grown man can do?

10:57.907 --> 11:02.455
Shift your hunting ground for a few years
and everyone forgets how the Law works.

11:03.496 --> 11:04.668
Well, let me remind you.

11:05.290 --> 11:10.428
A man-cub becomes man...
and man is forbidden!

11:12.255 --> 11:14.599
- What do you know about Law?
- Raksha.

11:14.757 --> 11:17.226
Hunting for pleasure. Killing for power.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.930
You've never known Law. The cub is mine!

11:20.638 --> 11:21.639
Mine to me.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.892
So, go back to where you came from,
you burned beast!

11:27.687 --> 11:30.782
The tiger knows who rules
this part of the Jungle.

11:31.232 --> 11:33.781
I'm sure he doesn't mean to come here
and make threats.

11:34.611 --> 11:37.490
Especially during a Water Truce.

11:45.580 --> 11:49.960
No, I'm deeply respectful of these Laws
that keep us safe.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.504
So, here's my promise.

11:53.296 --> 11:55.173
Nothing lasts forever.

11:56.299 --> 12:00.270
The rains will return
and the river will rise.

12:00.678 --> 12:04.148
And when this rock disappears,
that Truce will end.

12:05.642 --> 12:08.145
You want to protect him, fine.

12:08.645 --> 12:14.197
But ask yourselves,
how many lives is a man-cub worth?

12:28.706 --> 12:30.504
How many lives?

12:32.835 --> 12:34.837
Who could answer that question?

13:04.242 --> 13:06.210
- The rain!
- Rain!

13:06.369 --> 13:07.370
- Rain!
- The rain!

13:08.830 --> 13:11.424
Keep it dry, keep it dry, keep it dry.

13:12.041 --> 13:14.339
These quills get stuck on everything!

13:17.046 --> 13:22.393
When the rains returned, it was
a question the Council had to face.

13:48.119 --> 13:52.586
They deliberated and they argued...
for many days.

13:57.879 --> 13:59.881
What do you think they're talking about?

14:01.924 --> 14:04.768
No one had ever come
between the Pack before.

14:06.137 --> 14:08.435
But Shere Khan's threat...

14:08.598 --> 14:10.600
was not to be ignored.

14:18.775 --> 14:21.403
Mowgli, you're not supposed
to go up there!

14:28.951 --> 14:30.294
He's got to go.

14:31.996 --> 14:32.997
Look at the skies.

14:33.956 --> 14:36.300
Shere Khan may be heading here
as we speak.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.051
Please!

14:41.005 --> 14:42.552
I'm leaving.

14:45.802 --> 14:47.349
I don't want to see anyone get hurt.

14:47.845 --> 14:49.518
Mowgli, go back to the den!

14:50.014 --> 14:51.311
A man-cub belongs with man.

14:51.808 --> 14:53.276
We raised him as one of our own!

14:53.601 --> 14:56.104
- He'll have the boy, either way.
- Akela.

14:58.481 --> 14:59.949
Maybe I can be of help.

15:00.108 --> 15:01.485
The boy's right.

15:01.651 --> 15:03.528
Maybe it's time he found another people.

15:03.986 --> 15:06.364
- No.
- I'm the one who brought him to you.

15:06.531 --> 15:08.659
And now I'll return him
to where he belongs.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.117
I won't let you.

15:10.535 --> 15:11.661
He's my cub!

15:12.078 --> 15:13.170
We knew this day would come.

15:13.496 --> 15:15.590
We are the only family he's ever known!

15:15.748 --> 15:16.840
Raksha.

15:18.626 --> 15:21.220
It's the only place he'll be safe.

15:25.842 --> 15:27.139
It's okay, ami.

15:27.301 --> 15:28.848
I won't go far.

15:29.512 --> 15:31.685
I'll come back and visit.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.439
Never forget this...

15:36.269 --> 15:38.192
You're mine.

15:38.354 --> 15:39.901
Mine to me.

15:40.606 --> 15:44.156
No matter where you go,
or what they may call you...

15:44.318 --> 15:45.740
you will always be...

15:46.195 --> 15:47.447
my son.

16:25.401 --> 16:26.869
I wish I could tell you...

16:27.028 --> 16:29.577
that the wolves
could've fought Shere Khan.

16:31.407 --> 16:33.580
But this is not that kind of a tale.

16:35.870 --> 16:37.747
The turtles like me.

16:37.914 --> 16:39.757
Maybe the crocodiles.

16:40.249 --> 16:41.375
What about the rhinos?

16:41.542 --> 16:43.419
They always let me hang around.

16:44.754 --> 16:46.722
Of course, the rhinos sleep standing up.

16:48.424 --> 16:50.267
I don't think I'd be very good at that.

16:50.426 --> 16:52.724
It's either the turtles or the crocodiles.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.601
Which one do you think is better?

16:54.764 --> 16:56.016
Neither.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.855
What do you mean?

16:58.017 --> 17:00.236
I'm bringing you to the man village.

17:01.604 --> 17:02.605
What?

17:03.272 --> 17:05.569
Bagheera, I don't know man.

17:05.733 --> 17:06.858
You will.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.454
You always said we're not supposed

17:10.570 --> 17:12.618
to go near a man village.

17:12.781 --> 17:14.625
That was different.

17:14.784 --> 17:16.377
Why is it different?

17:16.786 --> 17:18.413
You always said, "Stay away
from the man village...

17:18.579 --> 17:20.080
"because you might fall in a trap...

17:20.540 --> 17:22.759
"or get eaten,
or get hurt by flying rocks."

17:22.916 --> 17:24.589
I know what I said.

17:29.799 --> 17:32.723
Whoa. Elephants.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.305
- Bow your head.
- Why?

17:35.471 --> 17:37.473
Show them respect.

17:37.974 --> 17:40.443
The elephants created this Jungle.

17:40.601 --> 17:43.980
Where they made furrows
with their tusks, the rivers ran.

17:44.146 --> 17:45.898
Where they blew with
their trunks, the leaves fell.

17:46.983 --> 17:49.327
They made all that belongs.

17:49.485 --> 17:52.784
The mountains, the trees,
the birds in the trees.

17:52.947 --> 17:54.494
But they did not make you.

17:55.449 --> 17:57.247
That is why you must go.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.023
What if I live with the nilgai?

18:27.106 --> 18:28.107
No.

18:28.691 --> 18:29.817
Or the mongoose?

18:29.984 --> 18:31.531
This is not a discussion.

18:31.694 --> 18:32.991
But this is my home!

18:33.070 --> 18:34.538
I don't even know what man's like.

18:34.697 --> 18:35.949
You'll learn.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.367
But I wanna stay in the Jungle.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.080
Why do I have to go there?

18:39.243 --> 18:41.416
Because the Jungle
is no longer safe for you.

18:41.579 --> 18:42.580
You're being hunted...

18:42.997 --> 18:44.044
by a tiger.

18:44.206 --> 18:46.083
Only man can protect you now.

18:46.167 --> 18:47.168
Whoa!

18:48.461 --> 18:51.214
This isn't fair.
You're not giving me a choice.

18:51.380 --> 18:52.973
There's a lot of stuff
you're not telling me, too.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.634
Don't think I didn't notice.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.518
You say you're taking me
where I came from...

18:56.677 --> 18:58.145
but you found me in the Jungle.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.682
Are you bringing me back
to the Jungle? No.

19:00.848 --> 19:03.643
Why are you bringing me to the man
village if you found me in the Jungle?

19:03.809 --> 19:05.732
And why does the tiger hate me so much?

19:05.895 --> 19:07.818
Does he know me?
Sure seems like he knows me.

19:07.938 --> 19:08.939
Down.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.826
What? Now we have to bow
to the buffalo, too?

19:12.985 --> 19:14.862
Listen to me. This is not a game.

19:15.029 --> 19:16.906
You're gonna run to that ravine.

19:17.281 --> 19:18.908
What are you talking about?

19:19.367 --> 19:20.835
Go to the north,
where the sky glows at night.

19:20.993 --> 19:21.994
I'll find you on that path.

19:22.411 --> 19:24.379
Bagheera, I'm not taking one
more step until you tell me...

19:51.774 --> 19:53.117
Run, Mowgli!

19:54.944 --> 19:55.945
Run!

21:29.872 --> 21:31.249
Gray, what's wrong?

21:31.415 --> 21:33.383
Why don't you come outside and play?

21:35.044 --> 21:36.136
What is that?

21:40.424 --> 21:42.097
Why did he have to leave?

21:42.259 --> 21:43.260
Gray.

21:43.427 --> 21:47.307
We could've protected him.
We shouldn't have let him go.

21:47.848 --> 21:49.225
I miss him, too.

21:49.725 --> 21:52.353
What's important is, he's safe now.

22:00.277 --> 22:01.779
Get inside.

22:47.283 --> 22:49.957
I suppose you know why I've come.

22:52.788 --> 22:54.916
The man-cub has left the Jungle.

22:59.503 --> 23:01.221
I thought I made myself clear.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.553
I wanted him turned over to me.

23:04.550 --> 23:06.473
We no longer harbour him.

23:07.011 --> 23:09.309
He has left the Pack.

23:10.180 --> 23:13.024
And where, may I ask, has he gone?

23:17.771 --> 23:19.523
He's with his own kind now.

23:21.817 --> 23:24.070
So, the man-cub has left the Jungle.

23:24.862 --> 23:26.159
That's right.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.912
You and I no longer have a quarrel.

23:29.074 --> 23:30.997
And, most importantly...

23:31.160 --> 23:32.503
we have peace.

23:39.084 --> 23:41.086
I guess it's done, then.

23:42.504 --> 23:44.381
Unless I can draw him...

23:44.840 --> 23:45.887
back out!

23:46.383 --> 23:47.851
Akela!

23:51.221 --> 23:53.064
Have I got your attention now?

23:53.515 --> 23:56.018
I didn't want it to be this way.

23:56.185 --> 23:58.358
I made it so simple.

23:58.520 --> 24:02.150
All I asked for was one thing,
and you denied me!

24:03.067 --> 24:05.161
That ends now.

24:05.569 --> 24:07.196
Spread the word.

24:07.696 --> 24:11.121
Until I have the man-cub,
these hills are my hills.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.706
You did not respond to reason!

24:14.203 --> 24:15.921
So now, you will know fear.

27:05.707 --> 27:07.380
Bagheera?

28:48.018 --> 28:49.019
Hmm?

28:51.813 --> 28:53.235
Hey, there.

28:56.944 --> 28:58.366
Do you have a language?

29:02.324 --> 29:04.372
You're kind of cute, I guess.

29:05.994 --> 29:07.541
You want a bite?

29:09.456 --> 29:10.457
Come on.

29:10.791 --> 29:13.169
Come here. Come on, it's all right.

29:13.335 --> 29:14.632
Don't be afraid.

29:24.304 --> 29:25.681
Come on.

29:27.641 --> 29:29.359
Hey, those are mine!

29:33.105 --> 29:34.402
Hey, come back!

29:36.608 --> 29:38.201
Those are mine!

29:40.195 --> 29:41.492
Drop it!

29:57.921 --> 29:59.389
Hello?

30:16.898 --> 30:18.445
Who's out there?

30:18.900 --> 30:20.743
Hi, little cub.

30:21.737 --> 30:23.785
Oh, no. Don't be scared.

30:25.032 --> 30:26.750
I'm not gonna hurt you.

30:28.910 --> 30:32.915
I was just passing through.
I don't want any trouble.

30:33.081 --> 30:35.083
There's no trouble.

30:36.084 --> 30:37.961
Are you alone out here?

30:38.754 --> 30:40.597
Mmm. That's not good.

30:40.964 --> 30:43.433
We should never be alone.

30:44.426 --> 30:46.428
I'm waiting for a friend.

30:46.595 --> 30:48.438
He should be here soon.

30:49.931 --> 30:51.979
I can stay with you, until he gets here.

30:53.310 --> 30:55.278
Would that be all right?

30:58.440 --> 31:00.442
I'll keep you safe.

31:01.485 --> 31:04.455
Just you and me, sweet thing.

31:07.574 --> 31:09.076
Who are you?

31:11.828 --> 31:14.047
Kaa.

31:19.836 --> 31:22.259
Poor, sweet little cub.

31:23.131 --> 31:26.226
What are you doing so deep in the Jungle?

31:27.636 --> 31:29.309
This is my home.

31:29.971 --> 31:31.518
Don't you know what you are?

31:33.975 --> 31:35.977
I know what you are.

31:38.480 --> 31:40.858
I know where you came from.

31:41.817 --> 31:43.444
You do?

31:44.152 --> 31:45.495
Yes.

31:51.827 --> 31:54.501
Would you like to see?

31:57.791 --> 31:59.008
Yeah.

32:01.795 --> 32:04.514
Mostly, men stay in their village...

32:04.714 --> 32:07.217
far from the dark of the Jungle.

32:07.676 --> 32:09.053
But sometimes...

32:09.219 --> 32:10.721
they travel.

32:10.887 --> 32:12.855
And when they do...

32:13.014 --> 32:16.018
their caves breathe in the dark.

32:16.184 --> 32:17.686
They call it...

32:18.812 --> 32:21.531
the Red Flower.

32:30.657 --> 32:32.409
Man's creation.

32:33.410 --> 32:35.538
It brings warmth and light...

32:36.371 --> 32:39.045
and destruction to all that it touches.

32:43.336 --> 32:44.713
Who is that?

32:44.880 --> 32:47.975
The traveller, protecting his cub.

33:11.364 --> 33:13.833
Shere Khan ended
the man's life that night.

33:16.244 --> 33:20.249
But not before he was burned
by the Red Flower's touch.

33:20.832 --> 33:25.087
He ran so fast, he didn't
notice the cub he left behind.

33:35.305 --> 33:37.148
And that cub...

33:37.307 --> 33:38.433
was you.

34:03.083 --> 34:05.131
The panther found you.

34:16.679 --> 34:19.809
Oh, you poor, sweet thing.

34:22.185 --> 34:24.279
You want to stay in the Jungle?

34:29.150 --> 34:31.494
You can be with me, if you want.

34:32.529 --> 34:34.657
I'll keep you close.

34:36.116 --> 34:38.494
Let go of your fear, now.

34:41.161 --> 34:43.540
Trust...

34:43.831 --> 34:45.175
in me.

35:14.738 --> 35:15.739
Relax, kid.

35:15.905 --> 35:17.202
No need to get worked up. Okay?

35:17.741 --> 35:19.334
- Where am I?
- Uh...

35:20.368 --> 35:22.541
This is a cave. It's my cave.

35:24.664 --> 35:26.166
You don't remember what happened, do you?

35:26.708 --> 35:28.551
- No.
- I saved your life.

35:29.544 --> 35:31.592
Yeah, I snatched you
from the jaws of death.

35:31.755 --> 35:33.928
The coils of death, if you will.

35:34.090 --> 35:35.967
And lucky for you...

35:36.384 --> 35:38.227
your new favourite hero,
old Baloo, here...

35:38.386 --> 35:40.730
just happened to be passing by.

35:40.889 --> 35:41.890
Uh, no big deal.

35:42.223 --> 35:44.191
Just tell me this.

35:44.643 --> 35:45.940
Can you...

35:47.228 --> 35:48.571
climb?

35:50.398 --> 35:51.490
Yeah.

35:51.858 --> 35:54.737
Then let's quit wasting time
and get on with it.

35:55.195 --> 35:56.412
Get on with what?

35:56.905 --> 35:58.907
Payback, kid. Payback.

35:59.407 --> 36:02.035
What do you mean "payback"?
Payback for what?

36:03.995 --> 36:05.247
You owe me, kid.

36:05.413 --> 36:07.131
You owe me. You owe me.

36:07.290 --> 36:08.291
Slow down.

36:08.416 --> 36:10.214
- And you're gonna pay back.
- But, but...

36:10.377 --> 36:11.469
Because that's right.

36:11.586 --> 36:12.803
You're gonna do the right thing.

36:12.962 --> 36:13.963
That's the right thing to do.

36:14.130 --> 36:15.473
You're gonna pay me back,
because you owe me.

36:15.632 --> 36:16.724
You got it?

36:26.101 --> 36:27.444
Okay, here's our little task.

36:27.602 --> 36:29.604
You see that golden stuff,
dripping down there?

36:30.063 --> 36:31.406
That's called "honey."

36:31.773 --> 36:33.446
All you need to do, little one...

36:33.608 --> 36:35.076
for payback purposes...

36:35.235 --> 36:37.613
is to just shimmy on up there...

36:37.779 --> 36:40.328
and get me that thing up there
that's making that funny noise...

36:40.490 --> 36:41.992
and bring it back down.

36:44.285 --> 36:45.878
You're kidding me, right?

36:46.621 --> 36:48.419
No, not really.

36:48.957 --> 36:51.085
I can get killed going up there.

36:51.251 --> 36:52.468
Kid!

36:52.961 --> 36:55.089
Kid, kid, kid. Try to understand this.

36:55.588 --> 36:56.760
I'm a bear.

36:56.923 --> 36:59.472
It means that I have to eat my weight...

36:59.634 --> 37:00.681
every day...

37:00.844 --> 37:02.471
for hibernation purposes.

37:02.929 --> 37:07.396
I know I'm asking for a lot,
but I don't climb and you do.

37:08.184 --> 37:11.108
Look, I really need your help.
Winter's coming.

37:11.271 --> 37:13.273
You don't want me to go to sleep...

37:13.440 --> 37:15.283
and never wake up.

38:40.068 --> 38:42.070
There are a lot of bees up here.

38:42.403 --> 38:43.905
Yeah, some.

38:44.072 --> 38:46.370
But don't worry. These ones don't sting.

38:53.957 --> 38:55.129
Attaboy!

38:56.042 --> 38:57.419
Ow! I'm getting stung!

39:00.046 --> 39:01.719
Okay.

39:02.131 --> 39:05.635
I would've done this myself,
but I'm afraid of heights.

39:06.177 --> 39:07.269
Oh, boy. Here we go again.

39:07.762 --> 39:08.763
Why don't you mind your own business?

39:09.097 --> 39:10.098
You can do it!

39:10.265 --> 39:12.233
- He's just gonna run away.
- Not this one.

39:12.725 --> 39:14.147
As soon as the monkeys get
stung, they always run away.

39:14.519 --> 39:16.396
- He's not a monkey. A man-cub.
- What is he?

39:16.813 --> 39:18.690
A man-cub?
Yeah! Could you keep your voice down?

39:18.898 --> 39:20.024
I'm trying to concentrate.

39:20.525 --> 39:23.369
- Everything going A-okay up there?
- Ow!

39:24.070 --> 39:25.913
Oh, boy. Looks like you got another one.

39:26.281 --> 39:27.453
- Buzz off.
- It's a man-cub.

39:27.907 --> 39:28.954
- A man-cub?
- Yeah, it's a man-cub.

39:29.117 --> 39:31.415
- It's not a monkey?
- No, it's a man-cub!

39:32.078 --> 39:34.456
You have never been
a more endangered species...

39:34.622 --> 39:36.124
than you are at this moment.

39:36.499 --> 39:38.501
You're doing an amazing job!

39:38.793 --> 39:40.136
I'm getting stung!

39:40.628 --> 39:41.925
Oh, boy. Here we go again.

39:42.088 --> 39:43.806
- It's not a monkey, Fred.
- It's a man-cub.

39:43.965 --> 39:45.308
- A man-cub?
- Yeah, it's a man-cub.

39:45.466 --> 39:47.059
- Can you believe it?
- Are you sure?

39:47.552 --> 39:48.769
Would you please shut up?

39:49.137 --> 39:50.309
Hey, up there!

39:50.471 --> 39:52.644
Everything is going fantastically, I see.

39:54.642 --> 39:55.814
Ow!

39:56.853 --> 39:58.901
You got it! Believe in yourself!

40:04.360 --> 40:06.283
- There you go!
- Ow!

40:06.696 --> 40:07.948
Come on! Almost!

40:08.823 --> 40:09.824
Yeah!

40:10.158 --> 40:11.330
Yeah!

40:13.828 --> 40:14.829
Oh, yeah!

40:15.204 --> 40:16.672
Uh-oh.

40:20.501 --> 40:21.798
Fred?

40:33.932 --> 40:36.026
Oh, yeah, exfoliate me.

40:40.021 --> 40:41.273
You said they didn't sting.

40:41.439 --> 40:43.316
What do you call this?

40:43.775 --> 40:45.448
How the heck did you do that?

40:45.610 --> 40:47.704
Oh, those must have been females!

40:49.322 --> 40:50.790
They look like males from down here.

40:51.282 --> 40:52.704
Females do sting.

40:52.867 --> 40:54.744
Just put some honey on those.

40:55.161 --> 40:57.209
- Honey? Really?
- Yeah.

40:57.705 --> 40:59.457
You put it on, you lick it off.
You feel much better.

40:59.958 --> 41:01.676
It's nature's ointment.

41:01.834 --> 41:03.381
I put it everywhere.

41:07.173 --> 41:08.174
Thanks.

41:08.341 --> 41:09.558
Okay, so, we're even now!

41:10.051 --> 41:11.177
Hold on a minute.

41:11.719 --> 41:12.811
What's your name anyway?

41:12.887 --> 41:14.810
We were never properly introduced.

41:14.973 --> 41:16.896
- Mowgli.
- Mowgli?

41:17.058 --> 41:20.528
Mowgli is a terrific name.

41:20.687 --> 41:23.236
I bet you got that one
all to yourself, too.

41:23.898 --> 41:24.899
Hey!

41:25.066 --> 41:26.409
Mowgli, look...

41:26.567 --> 41:29.070
I got a lot of gathering to do
these next couple of weeks...

41:29.612 --> 41:31.660
on account of the hibernation.

41:31.823 --> 41:33.621
I could really use your help.

41:33.783 --> 41:35.080
You know, if you stuck around...

41:35.243 --> 41:37.621
I can't. I have to go to the man village.

41:38.329 --> 41:39.501
Uh...

41:39.580 --> 41:41.127
For what reason, man village?

41:41.290 --> 41:43.463
I don't have a choice.
There's a tiger hunting me.

41:43.626 --> 41:45.253
Really? Why a tiger?

41:45.420 --> 41:46.922
Because I'm a man-cub, all right?

41:47.005 --> 41:48.427
Just leave me alone.

41:51.009 --> 41:54.434
Hey! Mowgli, my friend, my buddy, my pal.

41:54.595 --> 41:56.142
Slow down a second, handsome.

41:56.305 --> 41:58.478
Bagheera said I have to go
to the man village.

41:58.683 --> 42:02.779
Oh, Bagheera! I know him. Sure.

42:02.937 --> 42:04.530
You know what his problem is?

42:04.689 --> 42:06.862
He always plays by the rules.

42:07.025 --> 42:08.993
And, sometimes rules were meant to be...

42:09.152 --> 42:11.496
well, not necessarily broken,
but certainly bent.

42:11.654 --> 42:14.032
And definitely reinterpreted.
Don't you think?

42:14.198 --> 42:16.792
He told me to go to the man village,
so, that's where I'm gonna go!

42:16.868 --> 42:17.915
Okay, fine.

42:17.994 --> 42:19.621
You wanna go to the man village,
have it your way.

42:19.787 --> 42:21.630
In fact, I'll do you one better.

42:21.789 --> 42:23.666
I'll take you there myself.

42:23.833 --> 42:25.676
Come on, let's go. It's getting late.

42:30.798 --> 42:33.096
Bare necessities

42:33.176 --> 42:34.177
Forget about

42:34.635 --> 42:38.185
Your worries and your strife

42:38.347 --> 42:41.851
I mean the bare necessities

42:42.018 --> 42:43.361
What's that?

42:43.519 --> 42:45.817
That's a song about the good life.

42:46.606 --> 42:48.074
What's a song?

42:48.232 --> 42:50.906
You never heard a song before?

42:51.069 --> 42:52.946
Everyone's got a song.

42:53.112 --> 42:54.739
Didn't the wolves ever sing?

42:54.906 --> 42:56.123
I don't know.

42:56.240 --> 42:57.617
Uh... Oh...

42:58.284 --> 43:00.332
We recited the Law of the Jungle.

43:01.037 --> 43:03.005
"This is the Law of the Jungle...

43:03.164 --> 43:05.508
"as old and as true as the sky.

43:05.666 --> 43:07.509
"The Wolf that keeps it may prosper...

43:07.668 --> 43:10.387
"but the Wolf that breaks it will die."

43:11.714 --> 43:13.842
Kid, that's not a song.

43:14.008 --> 43:15.931
That's propaganda.

43:18.846 --> 43:20.769
What's propaganda?

43:27.396 --> 43:28.739
Just a little farther.

43:37.031 --> 43:38.783
That's the man village?

43:38.950 --> 43:41.624
Yep. You can always
tell by the Red Flower.

43:42.161 --> 43:44.038
They do love their Red Flower.

43:46.582 --> 43:49.131
The Red Flower doesn't seem so bad.

43:49.293 --> 43:50.294
Yeah.

43:50.378 --> 43:53.348
Let it loose, and it destroys
everything it touches.

43:53.506 --> 43:54.507
Don't ever play with it.

43:54.924 --> 43:55.971
You got that?

43:56.050 --> 43:57.222
Yeah, I got it.

43:57.385 --> 43:58.386
Good.

44:04.183 --> 44:06.606
Do you think that's where I'm from?

44:07.103 --> 44:08.104
Could be.

44:08.229 --> 44:10.106
I don't know, kid. Does it look familiar?

44:10.565 --> 44:11.566
I don't remember it.

44:11.649 --> 44:14.744
All I remember is living with the wolves.

44:15.486 --> 44:17.534
Why do you wanna go there?

44:17.697 --> 44:19.699
Bagheera said I need a people.

44:20.449 --> 44:22.668
Again, with the listening to Bagheera.

44:22.827 --> 44:24.500
Hey, he's my friend, okay?

44:24.954 --> 44:27.207
Now I don't even know where he is.

44:31.878 --> 44:34.677
I can't believe I'm leaving
the Jungle for good.

44:34.839 --> 44:36.261
May I say just one thing?

44:36.883 --> 44:39.136
What I saw you do today,
I've never seen anything like it.

44:39.302 --> 44:41.350
I've been trying to get
that honey for years.

44:42.388 --> 44:43.981
But I used my tricks.

44:44.140 --> 44:45.357
What tricks?

44:46.267 --> 44:47.268
You know...

44:48.060 --> 44:50.859
Everything that I built.
It's not the wolf way.

44:51.314 --> 44:52.816
Who cares? "The wolf way."

44:52.982 --> 44:54.484
That's the Mowgli way.

44:54.650 --> 44:55.902
That's the Baloo way.

44:56.068 --> 44:57.194
That's our way.

44:57.361 --> 44:58.738
That's how we get things done.

44:58.905 --> 45:00.828
I can't even imagine what kind
of potential you'd have...

45:01.282 --> 45:03.159
if you had somebody like me
helping you out.

45:04.535 --> 45:06.663
You say you want to go to the man village.

45:07.163 --> 45:09.666
I say, you could be a man right here.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.001
I'll tell you what.

45:12.168 --> 45:13.841
Now you know where the man village is.

45:14.003 --> 45:16.347
You can always go down there,
whenever you want.

45:16.881 --> 45:20.264
But I would personally appreciate it
as a personal favour to me, personally...

45:20.426 --> 45:23.145
if we just worked together,
just us, tricks and all.

45:24.347 --> 45:26.475
I think it would be interesting to see...

45:26.641 --> 45:28.814
just how much honey we could accumulate...

45:29.227 --> 45:30.353
before winter.

45:30.519 --> 45:32.942
Whatever I could do to make
your trickiness happen...

45:33.105 --> 45:34.197
I will do.

45:34.357 --> 45:37.156
And if it turns out to
not be fun for you...

45:37.318 --> 45:40.288
I will walk you right down
to that man village myself.

45:40.404 --> 45:41.405
Is that a deal?

45:43.908 --> 45:45.660
Just till winter.

45:47.578 --> 45:49.080
Just till winter.

45:57.630 --> 45:59.348
Ami, wake up.

46:05.012 --> 46:06.514
Pups?

46:06.681 --> 46:08.308
They're up there.

46:15.147 --> 46:17.946
The deer, of course,
take comfort in numbers.

46:18.734 --> 46:22.079
They lack defences most animals will have.

46:22.238 --> 46:24.536
And if we're being honest...

46:24.699 --> 46:27.293
they're not very smart either.

46:27.451 --> 46:30.208
Unlike the mother crocodile,
who is a good deal more clever.

46:34.917 --> 46:37.716
But the one you have to watch out for...

46:37.878 --> 46:40.381
is the cuckoo bird.

46:40.840 --> 46:44.219
Do you know how the cuckoo bird survives?

46:45.136 --> 46:47.559
By preying on a mother's weakness.

46:47.722 --> 46:51.067
The cuckoo bird is too clever
to raise its young.

46:51.225 --> 46:52.351
Instead, it sneaks...

46:52.727 --> 46:55.480
its eggs into the nests of simpler birds.

46:55.646 --> 46:57.148
So, when they hatch...

46:57.315 --> 46:59.317
the mother bird is fooled.

46:59.483 --> 47:01.827
She feeds them, nurtures them.

47:02.820 --> 47:05.915
And do you know what happens
to her own chicks?

47:06.741 --> 47:08.288
They starve...

47:08.451 --> 47:09.668
and die...

47:09.827 --> 47:11.295
from neglect.

47:12.079 --> 47:14.958
All because a mother loved a chick...

47:16.834 --> 47:18.836
that wasn't her own.

47:20.254 --> 47:21.847
Come now, time for sleep.

47:38.981 --> 47:40.983
I think they like me.

47:42.818 --> 47:44.536
Why are you doing this?

47:45.446 --> 47:46.493
He's gone.

47:46.655 --> 47:48.453
Isn't that what you wanted?

47:49.992 --> 47:51.494
I want him dead.

47:56.457 --> 47:58.676
Once he gets word of what happened here...

47:58.834 --> 48:00.211
he'll come back.

48:01.003 --> 48:03.131
And I'll be waiting.

48:58.060 --> 49:00.188
- That's the first mark.
- Got it.

49:00.354 --> 49:03.028
- That's the first mark!
- Got it!

49:06.026 --> 49:07.369
That's the first mark!

49:07.528 --> 49:08.529
Got it!

49:12.366 --> 49:13.367
Whoo!

49:13.742 --> 49:14.743
Yeah, I got it!

49:15.202 --> 49:18.297
- Tell him to go to the second mark!
- Got it!

49:18.998 --> 49:22.252
- Go to the second mark!
- Got it.

49:22.585 --> 49:24.053
Got it.

49:26.881 --> 49:29.634
- Look for the
- Bare necessities

49:29.717 --> 49:31.890
The simple bare necessities

49:32.052 --> 49:33.474
Forget about your worries

49:33.846 --> 49:35.393
And your strife

49:35.556 --> 49:38.560
I mean the bare necessities

49:38.726 --> 49:40.774
Old Mother Nature's recipes

49:41.270 --> 49:43.739
That bring the bare necessities of life

49:45.608 --> 49:49.158
Wherever I wander wherever I roam

49:49.320 --> 49:51.664
I couldn't be fonder

49:52.156 --> 49:53.908
Of my big home

49:54.074 --> 49:55.326
The bees are buzzing

49:55.743 --> 49:56.744
In the tree

49:56.869 --> 49:59.213
To make some honey just for me

49:59.663 --> 50:01.506
When you look under the rocks and plants

50:01.665 --> 50:03.667
And take a glance at them fancy ants

50:04.084 --> 50:05.586
And then maybe try a few

50:06.504 --> 50:09.007
The bare necessities of life

50:09.465 --> 50:10.682
They'll come to you!

50:11.258 --> 50:13.352
Wherever I wander

50:13.719 --> 50:16.268
Wherever I roam

50:16.680 --> 50:17.932
I couldn't be fonder

50:18.098 --> 50:20.100
Of my big home

50:20.267 --> 50:22.520
The bees are buzzing in the tree

50:22.686 --> 50:25.109
To make some honey just for me

50:25.773 --> 50:27.867
When you look under the rocks and plants

50:28.025 --> 50:29.402
And then take a glance at them fancy ants

50:29.818 --> 50:31.786
And then maybe try a few

50:31.946 --> 50:33.664
Mmm! Mmm!

50:33.822 --> 50:36.496
The bare necessities of life
They'll come to you

50:37.451 --> 50:39.374
They will come to you

50:40.538 --> 50:41.790
Yeah, they'll come to you!

50:42.289 --> 50:43.290
Come to you!

50:43.457 --> 50:45.551
Baloo, Baloo, Baloo... look.

50:49.672 --> 50:51.299
Stay low on my back.

50:59.223 --> 51:00.816
Come on out and show yourself.

51:08.524 --> 51:10.492
Bagheera! Ah!

51:11.068 --> 51:12.069
Mowgli.

51:13.028 --> 51:15.326
Oh, I was looking everywhere for you!

51:15.406 --> 51:16.658
I thought you were gone!

51:16.824 --> 51:18.326
- Are you all right?
- Yeah!

51:18.701 --> 51:20.920
I can't believe you found me!
I was so worried about you.

51:21.412 --> 51:23.665
I was lost, and I didn't know
what happened...

51:23.831 --> 51:25.083
but then I met Baloo.

51:25.249 --> 51:27.172
And then he saved me from a giant snake!

51:27.376 --> 51:28.923
And now we're working together!

51:29.420 --> 51:31.013
Really? That's a new wrinkle.

51:31.171 --> 51:32.639
I didn't know sloth bears worked.

51:33.757 --> 51:36.180
Come on, Mowgli, let's be on our way.

51:37.052 --> 51:38.224
Wait!

51:39.346 --> 51:41.440
Yeah, go on ahead. I'll catch up.

51:42.933 --> 51:44.355
Don't be mad, okay?

51:44.518 --> 51:45.610
Why would I be mad?

51:45.769 --> 51:47.191
Because you're always mad when I do stuff.

51:47.354 --> 51:49.448
You gotta promise not to be mad this time.

51:49.607 --> 51:52.201
Show me, then I'll decide.

51:52.693 --> 51:54.036
Come on, check it out!

51:56.780 --> 51:59.033
These are vines I use on the cliff.

51:59.575 --> 52:01.953
I twirl them together to make
them longer and stronger.

52:02.369 --> 52:03.916
See how strong they are?

52:05.581 --> 52:07.424
You wanna see the really cool part?

52:07.583 --> 52:09.335
It's inside. Come on, let's go!

52:10.794 --> 52:11.966
Come on!

52:23.140 --> 52:25.609
It's the honey stash for winter!

52:27.061 --> 52:29.155
Have you lost your mind?

52:30.230 --> 52:32.153
You said you wouldn't get mad.

52:32.650 --> 52:34.573
Did you listen to anything
Akela taught you?

52:34.735 --> 52:35.782
There's no place...

52:36.236 --> 52:37.738
in the Jungle for these...

52:37.905 --> 52:38.906
tricks!

52:39.365 --> 52:41.163
You want to do this,
you do this in the man village.

52:42.117 --> 52:44.085
But I'm helping Baloo
get ready for hibernation.

52:44.578 --> 52:46.455
Bears don't hibernate in a jungle.

52:46.622 --> 52:47.919
What are you teaching him?

52:48.624 --> 52:51.673
Not full hibernation, but I nap a lot.

52:52.127 --> 52:54.129
Listen to me, you con artist!

52:54.296 --> 52:56.264
He may not know your game, but I do.

52:56.715 --> 52:58.388
- He's leaving now.
- But I don't wanna leave!

52:58.801 --> 53:00.428
You don't have a choice!

53:01.095 --> 53:02.187
Why don't we all just
settle down for a minute.

53:02.805 --> 53:05.103
Look, it's gotten late.
Too late to travel.

53:05.265 --> 53:07.017
So, why don't we all
just have a little honey...

53:07.476 --> 53:08.602
I don't eat honey.

53:08.977 --> 53:10.945
No problem. I'll eat the honey.

53:11.105 --> 53:14.442
Let's all get a good night's sleep,
and we can talk about this in the morning.

53:15.442 --> 53:18.286
Fine. But we're leaving, first thing.

55:35.833 --> 55:37.085
Mowgli.

55:45.801 --> 55:47.018
Where is he?

55:47.511 --> 55:49.263
- In the pit.
- In the what?

55:49.763 --> 55:51.765
- Is this your teaching?
- Oh, come on!

55:51.932 --> 55:54.776
You know I'd never teach him
to mess around with elephants.

56:48.572 --> 56:49.744
Hey, guys.

57:00.334 --> 57:02.712
What'd I tell you? He's special.

57:03.503 --> 57:04.880
I know he's special.

57:05.047 --> 57:06.515
I raised him.

57:08.717 --> 57:10.560
Then don't make him leave, Bagheera!

57:10.719 --> 57:13.017
You gotta let him be what he is.

57:13.180 --> 57:15.729
You don't understand. The boy's in danger.

57:15.891 --> 57:18.394
I know, he told me.
He's being hunted by a tiger.

57:18.560 --> 57:20.858
Not any tiger. Shere Khan.

57:21.355 --> 57:23.357
Shere Khan's hunting him?

57:23.523 --> 57:24.524
Oh.

57:25.192 --> 57:27.907
But if you send him back
to the man village, they'll ruin him.

57:28.070 --> 57:29.788
They'll make a man out of him.

57:29.947 --> 57:31.540
We should send him back to the Wolf Pack.

57:31.990 --> 57:34.243
Who's their alpha?
Akela, he can protect him.

57:34.409 --> 57:36.252
Akela is dead.

57:37.079 --> 57:39.207
- What?
- Shere Khan killed him.

57:39.581 --> 57:42.551
He will stop at nothing
until he has this boy.

57:42.709 --> 57:43.756
Nothing.

57:44.211 --> 57:45.633
The only way we can save him...

57:45.796 --> 57:47.969
is if he goes to that man village.

57:48.131 --> 57:49.553
Please, Baloo.

57:50.384 --> 57:52.136
You're the only one he'll listen to.

58:20.539 --> 58:21.791
Hey, kid.

58:21.915 --> 58:23.258
Hey.

58:24.042 --> 58:25.885
That was pretty cool,
what you did back there.

58:27.129 --> 58:28.881
Bagheera didn't think so.

58:29.047 --> 58:31.641
Oh, no, I talked to him.
He was very impressed.

58:32.718 --> 58:33.890
He was?

58:34.052 --> 58:35.395
We both were. Yeah.

58:36.054 --> 58:39.933
I've never seen anyone get
that close to an elephant before.

58:45.939 --> 58:46.940
So, listen, kid.

58:47.107 --> 58:49.235
I gotta talk to you about something.

58:49.401 --> 58:50.903
What do you wanna talk about?

58:51.069 --> 58:52.662
I've been thinking.

58:52.821 --> 58:54.823
Now that your friend has shown up...

58:54.990 --> 58:56.458
maybe it's time...

58:56.616 --> 58:59.335
for you two to just mosey along.

59:02.039 --> 59:04.007
Now it's winter...

59:04.166 --> 59:05.839
and it's really time for you to go.

59:06.752 --> 59:08.800
But I wanna stay here with you.

59:10.756 --> 59:12.929
We're buddies, aren't we?

59:13.467 --> 59:16.141
Huh? No, we were never friends.

59:16.303 --> 59:18.476
I certainly never thought
of you as my friend.

59:18.638 --> 59:21.812
You helped me get honey
and I don't really need you any more...

59:25.187 --> 59:26.985
Do I have to spell this out?

59:29.608 --> 59:32.407
I don't want you around any more.

59:45.123 --> 59:46.716
I did it.

59:47.834 --> 59:50.383
And that's about the hardest thing
I've ever done.

59:52.172 --> 59:53.799
I know.

01:00:38.718 --> 01:00:39.765
Go away.

01:00:45.892 --> 01:00:47.565
Get away from me.

01:00:51.565 --> 01:00:53.442
Stop it.

01:01:01.074 --> 01:01:02.667
Get away from me!

01:01:04.953 --> 01:01:07.081
Bagheera!

01:01:08.290 --> 01:01:09.542
Mowgli!

01:01:22.762 --> 01:01:24.389
Mowgli, hold on!

01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:30.020
Bagheera!

01:01:32.439 --> 01:01:34.112
What was that? Where are they taking him?

01:01:34.274 --> 01:01:35.776
This way.

01:01:39.404 --> 01:01:40.781
Ahh! Ah!

01:01:41.114 --> 01:01:42.115
Whoa!

01:01:46.453 --> 01:01:48.797
We see you! We see you!

01:01:59.216 --> 01:02:00.263
Come on, jump!

01:02:00.675 --> 01:02:01.722
And watch the claws.

01:02:34.376 --> 01:02:36.504
Gah!

01:03:07.826 --> 01:03:08.827
Uh...

01:03:09.286 --> 01:03:10.754
I'll take it from here.

01:03:10.912 --> 01:03:13.461
No, I'm coming.

01:03:13.915 --> 01:03:15.337
It's doable...

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.719
if I don't have to go too high.

01:03:17.877 --> 01:03:19.470
Good. Let's get going.

01:03:20.338 --> 01:03:21.590
All right.

01:04:06.301 --> 01:04:09.680
A bird. That can't be a good sign.

01:04:10.138 --> 01:04:13.438
Baloo. Look at me. Look at nothing but me.

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:15.647
- Hmm?
- You're doing fine.

01:04:15.810 --> 01:04:17.107
Just keep your eyes up high.

01:04:17.937 --> 01:04:20.531
All right. I'm coming. I'm coming.

01:05:52.407 --> 01:05:54.876
What part of the Jungle you from?

01:05:57.787 --> 01:05:59.039
You, man-cub.

01:06:00.039 --> 01:06:01.712
You come from the South, the North?

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:05.220
What part of the Jungle?

01:06:06.087 --> 01:06:08.181
The South, I guess.

01:06:08.673 --> 01:06:11.472
Southern Jungle, the Seeonee.

01:06:11.634 --> 01:06:14.228
Beautiful, I hear.
I never been there myself.

01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:20.735
So, tell me, you ever had
a taste of the pawpaw fruit...

01:06:20.894 --> 01:06:22.362
down there in the Seeonee?

01:06:22.854 --> 01:06:24.822
Some people call it the...
What's the word?

01:06:25.273 --> 01:06:27.492
Papaya. Stolen words.

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:29.277
I say pawpaw.

01:06:29.444 --> 01:06:32.368
Goes to the sound it makes
when it tumbles to the Jungle floor.

01:06:34.073 --> 01:06:35.165
Try it.

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:42.047
Go ahead.

01:06:50.173 --> 01:06:51.470
It's good.

01:06:53.801 --> 01:06:55.178
You know who I am?

01:06:56.387 --> 01:06:57.388
No.

01:06:57.972 --> 01:07:01.021
I am the King of the Bandar-log.

01:07:04.395 --> 01:07:05.612
Call me Louie.

01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:16.957
I did it!

01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:19.536
Well done, old chap.

01:07:22.288 --> 01:07:24.882
He must be in there. Follow me.

01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:28.678
No, no. We're on level ground here.

01:07:28.836 --> 01:07:30.509
I'm in charge.

01:07:30.672 --> 01:07:32.299
And I've got a plan.

01:07:32.799 --> 01:07:36.895
You are a man-cub
who wants to live in the Jungle.

01:07:37.428 --> 01:07:39.021
How do you know that?

01:07:39.472 --> 01:07:40.473
Kid...

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:44.235
I got ears. My ears got ears.

01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:46.067
You wanna live here?

01:07:46.229 --> 01:07:48.652
You need a people to protect you.

01:07:48.815 --> 01:07:50.817
Only I can protect you...

01:07:50.984 --> 01:07:52.657
and I will, for a price.

01:07:53.528 --> 01:07:55.326
I don't have anything to give you.

01:07:57.657 --> 01:07:59.204
I think you do.

01:08:01.035 --> 01:08:02.036
What?

01:08:02.495 --> 01:08:04.463
Look around, man-cub.

01:08:04.622 --> 01:08:06.124
I got everything.

01:08:06.291 --> 01:08:08.043
I have plentiful food...

01:08:08.209 --> 01:08:09.426
endless treasure...

01:08:09.586 --> 01:08:11.839
command vast legions.

01:08:12.839 --> 01:08:14.762
But there's one thing I don't have...

01:08:15.216 --> 01:08:16.513
and that's the one thing...

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:18.051
you can give me.

01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:21.564
The Red Flower.

01:08:22.557 --> 01:08:24.685
I don't have that!

01:08:25.143 --> 01:08:27.020
You're a man, aren't you?

01:08:29.188 --> 01:08:30.484
That's what makes you a man.

01:08:30.648 --> 01:08:32.992
You can summon the Red Flower...

01:08:33.151 --> 01:08:34.948
and control it.

01:08:35.403 --> 01:08:37.656
They told me not to go near
the Red Flower.

01:08:38.363 --> 01:08:39.866
You know why they tell you that?

01:08:40.033 --> 01:08:43.537
Because once you have it,
you rise to the top of the food chain.

01:08:43.703 --> 01:08:46.546
Nothing in this Jungle can stand up...

01:08:47.665 --> 01:08:49.258
to the Red Flower.

01:08:53.421 --> 01:08:54.889
Please, I just wanna go.

01:08:58.301 --> 01:09:00.804
Now, don't try to kid me, man-cub

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:02.971
I'll make a deal with you

01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:06.063
What I desire is man's red fire

01:09:06.225 --> 01:09:07.852
To make my dream come true

01:09:08.227 --> 01:09:09.854
Now give me the secret, man-cub

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:12.694
Come on! Clue me what to do

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:14.901
Give me the power of man's Red Flower

01:09:15.068 --> 01:09:16.911
So I can be like you

01:09:17.278 --> 01:09:18.779
Oh, ooo-be do

01:09:19.197 --> 01:09:21.620
I wanna be like you-oo-oo

01:09:21.783 --> 01:09:25.879
I wanna walk like you,
talk like you too-oo-oo

01:09:26.037 --> 01:09:31.009
You'll see it's true-oo-oo,
someone like me-ee-ee

01:09:31.501 --> 01:09:35.971
Can learn to be
like someone like you-oo-oo

01:09:36.506 --> 01:09:39.134
Now you might think
it's ridiculous that me

01:09:39.634 --> 01:09:42.057
A Gigantopithecus, would ever dream

01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:45.269
I'd like to team with
the likes of you, man-cub

01:09:45.682 --> 01:09:47.479
But together we'd have powers

01:09:47.642 --> 01:09:50.236
All the Jungle's treasures, ours

01:09:50.687 --> 01:09:52.781
I got desire, you got the fire

01:09:52.939 --> 01:09:54.441
But the dream I dream takes two

01:09:54.816 --> 01:09:56.614
So, oo-oo-oo

01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:58.908
I wanna be like you-oo-oo

01:09:59.570 --> 01:10:00.947
I wanna use that flame

01:10:01.447 --> 01:10:03.620
Just the same as you can do

01:10:04.033 --> 01:10:06.377
Oh, how magnificus it would be

01:10:06.869 --> 01:10:08.121
A Gigantopithecus like me

01:10:09.414 --> 01:10:10.415
Could learn to do

01:10:10.665 --> 01:10:12.793
Like you humans do-oo-oo

01:10:15.002 --> 01:10:16.424
Just one thing we need...

01:10:16.587 --> 01:10:18.715
to reach our full potential.

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:21.100
Bring me that Red Flower...

01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:23.053
and we will rule this Jungle.

01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:24.687
I will protect you.

01:10:25.596 --> 01:10:27.815
And you will want for nothing, ever again.

01:10:28.808 --> 01:10:29.934
I can't!

01:10:30.393 --> 01:10:32.020
You can't or you won't?

01:10:32.562 --> 01:10:33.939
I can't!

01:10:34.272 --> 01:10:35.319
You will!

01:10:35.690 --> 01:10:36.987
Excuse me!

01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:38.151
Anybody?

01:10:40.945 --> 01:10:41.946
Excuse me...

01:10:42.321 --> 01:10:44.198
am I in the right monkey temple?

01:10:44.782 --> 01:10:46.204
Oh, my gosh.

01:10:46.367 --> 01:10:49.371
Is that King Louie?

01:10:49.829 --> 01:10:51.877
This is so exciting.

01:10:52.373 --> 01:10:54.876
The legends do you no justice, sir.

01:10:55.376 --> 01:10:58.676
You are truly enormous.

01:11:00.047 --> 01:11:01.799
In the best way.

01:11:01.966 --> 01:11:04.765
Look at all of that flesh...

01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:06.770
just squatting there...

01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:08.397
on an ancient throne.

01:11:08.556 --> 01:11:09.682
How majestic.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:11.817
Seize him.

01:11:12.852 --> 01:11:14.399
Hey, hang on.

01:11:14.562 --> 01:11:16.155
Can you just hang on?

01:11:16.314 --> 01:11:19.193
I climbed a mountain to see you,
and I'm not a climber.

01:11:19.358 --> 01:11:21.360
Just to be in your presence.

01:11:21.527 --> 01:11:24.280
For me, this is a dream come true. Oh...

01:11:25.198 --> 01:11:26.541
Throw him off the cliff.

01:11:28.201 --> 01:11:30.124
Wait, wait, wait.

01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:31.708
I have no problem with that.

01:11:31.788 --> 01:11:33.381
I don't have any problem with that.

01:11:33.539 --> 01:11:36.088
I came up here without an invitation.

01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:38.048
It was extremely presumptuous of me.

01:11:38.544 --> 01:11:39.511
Let me interrupt myself.

01:11:39.587 --> 01:11:40.588
I just gotta say...

01:11:40.713 --> 01:11:43.557
you guys are so much handsomer
in person than anyone knows.

01:11:43.716 --> 01:11:45.810
No one ever gets up close to you.

01:11:45.968 --> 01:11:46.969
Why?

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:48.513
Because of the smell.

01:11:48.679 --> 01:11:50.477
The smell is rough.

01:11:50.890 --> 01:11:53.188
But it's not just, "Oh, look at me."

01:11:53.351 --> 01:11:56.275
It's, "I got the brains."
You guys got the know-how.

01:11:56.729 --> 01:11:58.402
You got the noggin.

01:11:58.815 --> 01:11:59.987
You came up with this stuff,
with the thumb.

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:02.743
Come on, show me.
How do you do that? I can't do that.

01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:06.031
Look, I scratch, I rub, I can grab a fish.

01:12:06.489 --> 01:12:08.867
But I was hoping, and you may
not be open to this at all...

01:12:09.033 --> 01:12:11.252
but I was hoping,
and once again, it's a dream...

01:12:11.744 --> 01:12:14.122
but I was hoping that I might become...

01:12:14.288 --> 01:12:16.165
a Bandar-log myself.

01:12:16.791 --> 01:12:18.259
Gosh, I wanna be like you.

01:12:18.751 --> 01:12:20.424
I am hitching my wagon to your star.

01:12:25.633 --> 01:12:26.725
No one leaves!

01:12:27.134 --> 01:12:29.262
I can show myself out. Thanks. Bye-bye!

01:12:46.988 --> 01:12:48.956
We'll try to hold them off.

01:13:24.317 --> 01:13:25.990
Where you going, man-cub?

01:13:26.402 --> 01:13:27.995
Stay away from me!

01:13:28.362 --> 01:13:30.535
You don't have anyone now.

01:13:30.698 --> 01:13:33.918
I'm your only hope.
I can make it real good for you here.

01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:35.498
Where else you gonna go?

01:13:35.953 --> 01:13:37.330
I'll go back to the Pack!

01:13:37.747 --> 01:13:39.169
I'll go back to Akela!

01:13:39.832 --> 01:13:41.049
Akela?

01:13:41.208 --> 01:13:42.585
Oh.

01:13:42.752 --> 01:13:43.969
You didn't hear?

01:13:45.838 --> 01:13:47.840
Shere Khan killed him.

01:13:50.176 --> 01:13:52.349
Must've been on account of you.

01:13:53.054 --> 01:13:54.601
No! You're lying!

01:13:59.977 --> 01:14:01.820
Don't run away...

01:14:04.815 --> 01:14:07.034
from who you are! You hear me?

01:14:33.886 --> 01:14:36.059
Think about it, man-cub.

01:14:39.433 --> 01:14:41.856
We can rule this Jungle.

01:14:44.689 --> 01:14:45.690
No...

01:14:45.773 --> 01:14:47.025
Listen to reason.

01:15:03.374 --> 01:15:04.626
Gotcha!

01:15:46.834 --> 01:15:48.051
Mowgli!

01:16:12.818 --> 01:16:14.616
If anything happens to that kid...

01:16:15.071 --> 01:16:16.539
I'll never forgive myself.

01:16:17.073 --> 01:16:19.451
- Bagheera!
- Mowgli?

01:16:20.743 --> 01:16:21.744
Stay there.

01:16:22.161 --> 01:16:23.913
We'll come around to you.

01:16:25.664 --> 01:16:27.211
Is it true?

01:16:27.666 --> 01:16:28.758
What?

01:16:29.251 --> 01:16:31.345
Is Akela dead?

01:16:32.546 --> 01:16:34.014
We were going to tell you.

01:16:35.341 --> 01:16:36.467
You knew!

01:16:36.634 --> 01:16:38.181
You both knew!

01:16:38.594 --> 01:16:40.892
And nobody did anything about it!

01:16:41.055 --> 01:16:42.352
Kid, just hold on.

01:16:42.848 --> 01:16:45.192
Someone's gotta do something!

01:16:45.643 --> 01:16:47.316
Mowgli!

01:19:05.491 --> 01:19:06.868
There's no trace of him.

01:19:07.034 --> 01:19:08.581
Where could he have gone?

01:19:23.634 --> 01:19:24.635
Come on!

01:19:46.699 --> 01:19:47.871
It's man.

01:19:48.033 --> 01:19:49.376
He's come to the Jungle.

01:19:55.332 --> 01:19:56.925
Ami, what's happening?

01:19:57.668 --> 01:19:59.090
The Red Flower.

01:19:59.253 --> 01:20:01.381
Everybody, get to the river!

01:20:15.436 --> 01:20:17.564
Red Flower.

01:20:18.564 --> 01:20:20.566
Pups, come on. Stay close.

01:20:34.747 --> 01:20:37.125
Is that Mowgli?

01:20:40.377 --> 01:20:41.799
Shere Khan!

01:20:43.464 --> 01:20:44.716
Shere Khan!

01:20:44.882 --> 01:20:46.259
I'm not afraid of you!

01:20:46.425 --> 01:20:48.678
No one has to be afraid of you any more!

01:20:53.265 --> 01:20:54.312
No...

01:20:57.895 --> 01:21:01.195
I think they're afraid
of something else now.

01:21:17.039 --> 01:21:19.292
The man-cub is now a man.

01:21:22.503 --> 01:21:23.504
Gray...

01:21:27.508 --> 01:21:29.226
Always a proud day...

01:21:30.135 --> 01:21:31.808
when they come of age.

01:21:34.848 --> 01:21:38.648
You can fool them, but you can't fool me.

01:21:39.436 --> 01:21:42.315
I'm the one who saw your future.

01:21:42.981 --> 01:21:45.530
I saw what you'd become.

01:21:51.115 --> 01:21:53.789
Come now, use the Red Flower.

01:21:53.951 --> 01:21:56.500
Use it on me like your father did.

01:22:00.666 --> 01:22:03.215
Show everyone what you really are!

01:22:08.882 --> 01:22:12.352
I'm Mowgli of the Seeonee
and this is my home!

01:22:18.434 --> 01:22:21.688
That was the stupidest thing
you could've done.

01:22:22.229 --> 01:22:24.152
Now you have nothing.

01:22:25.232 --> 01:22:28.702
No claws, no fur, no teeth...

01:22:29.570 --> 01:22:31.743
And no friends.

01:22:33.073 --> 01:22:35.542
"This is the Law of the Jungle...

01:22:35.701 --> 01:22:38.045
"as old and as true as the sky."

01:22:38.203 --> 01:22:39.250
What is this?

01:22:39.621 --> 01:22:41.544
"The Wolf that keeps it may prosper...

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:43.917
"but the Wolf that breaks it will die."

01:22:44.293 --> 01:22:45.294
You fools.

01:22:45.586 --> 01:22:48.385
"Like the creeper
that girdles the tree trunk...

01:22:48.797 --> 01:22:50.094
"the Law runneth over and back."

01:22:50.549 --> 01:22:52.051
Fine! Rise up, all of you!

01:22:52.551 --> 01:22:54.849
You want to put yourselves
between me and the man-cub?

01:22:55.262 --> 01:22:58.015
"...and the strength
of the Wolf is the Pack."

01:22:58.474 --> 01:23:00.067
I will have you all in my teeth!

01:23:24.041 --> 01:23:27.045
- No!
- Wolves, attack!

01:23:31.381 --> 01:23:33.258
Stay here!

01:23:33.759 --> 01:23:35.181
But I wanna fight with the wolves!

01:23:35.677 --> 01:23:37.896
- You can't fight him like a wolf.
- You're not a wolf!

01:23:39.014 --> 01:23:40.857
Fight him like a man.

01:23:42.935 --> 01:23:43.936
Now, go!

01:23:45.938 --> 01:23:46.905
Okay.

01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:47.981
We'll hold him off.

01:24:35.612 --> 01:24:38.411
It's time we put an end to this.

01:24:38.574 --> 01:24:39.575
No!

01:24:55.841 --> 01:24:57.184
Dead tree.

01:26:05.243 --> 01:26:06.870
It's just you and me now!

01:27:03.552 --> 01:27:05.225
Break, break!

01:27:56.021 --> 01:27:57.944
You've got nowhere to go, man-cub!

01:28:37.312 --> 01:28:40.532
Did you think I would let you grow old?

01:28:49.282 --> 01:28:51.876
Either I'll devour you
or the Red Flower will.

01:28:54.371 --> 01:28:55.998
It's just a matter of time.

01:28:59.876 --> 01:29:03.176
How long did you really think
you'd survive against me?

01:29:04.047 --> 01:29:07.051
Longer than your father did?

01:29:09.052 --> 01:29:12.181
Longer than... Akela?

01:29:29.197 --> 01:29:30.619
I'm not afraid of you!

01:29:38.290 --> 01:29:39.633
Do you hear me?

01:29:41.376 --> 01:29:43.344
I'm done running from you!

01:31:14.427 --> 01:31:16.429
You stood your ground, old boy.

01:31:16.596 --> 01:31:18.269
You stood your ground.

01:31:33.405 --> 01:31:34.827
Ami, ami!

01:31:37.409 --> 01:31:39.002
My son.

01:31:39.452 --> 01:31:41.170
- Mowgli!
- It's Mowgli!

01:31:46.584 --> 01:31:48.086
Mowgli.

01:32:15.613 --> 01:32:18.457
Will you look at that?

01:32:28.543 --> 01:32:31.922
And where they made furrows
in the ground with their tusks...

01:32:32.088 --> 01:32:34.511
there the rivers ran.

01:33:02.744 --> 01:33:05.338
In my years, I've seen
a lot in this Jungle.

01:33:06.456 --> 01:33:10.377
But that night, I saw something
I'll never forget.

01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:12.712
I saw a little boy...

01:33:13.379 --> 01:33:15.256
without a people...

01:33:15.924 --> 01:33:20.145
bring all the Jungle together
for the very first time.

01:33:40.782 --> 01:33:42.329
Just a few more turns.

01:33:43.118 --> 01:33:44.119
I'm going high!

01:33:44.244 --> 01:33:45.370
Stay low.

01:33:50.166 --> 01:33:51.588
He never listens.

01:34:01.261 --> 01:34:02.262
Gotcha!

01:34:02.595 --> 01:34:03.517
- Come on, Mowgli.
- You went in the tree.

01:34:03.596 --> 01:34:04.597
- That wasn't fair.
- We almost made it.

01:34:04.973 --> 01:34:05.974
You guys...

01:34:06.975 --> 01:34:09.444
are going too fast.

01:34:09.602 --> 01:34:11.980
Anybody ever teach you how to jog?

01:34:12.397 --> 01:34:15.116
You went high when everyone else
stayed on the trail.

01:34:15.567 --> 01:34:17.786
- But that's what you do.
- Maybe, but I'm not a wolf.

01:34:17.944 --> 01:34:19.912
Next time, stay together. Come on, guys.

01:34:21.114 --> 01:34:23.742
"For the strength of the Pack is the..."

01:34:25.451 --> 01:34:26.543
- Wolf.
- "Wolf...

01:34:26.703 --> 01:34:29.707
"and the strength of the Wolf
is the Pack."

01:34:29.873 --> 01:34:31.295
Mowgli's back!

01:34:34.919 --> 01:34:37.217
Hey, Mowgli! Wait for us.

01:34:38.131 --> 01:34:39.178
Hurry up, guys.

01:34:39.382 --> 01:34:40.429
Hi, Gray.

01:34:45.889 --> 01:34:47.141
Look well, wolves.

01:34:53.771 --> 01:34:56.240
"This is the Law of the Jungle...

01:34:56.399 --> 01:34:59.369
"as old and as true as the sky.

01:35:00.278 --> 01:35:02.201
"The Wolf that keeps it may prosper...

01:35:02.363 --> 01:35:05.287
"but the Wolf that breaks it will die.

01:35:05.450 --> 01:35:08.294
"Like the creeper that girdles
the tree trunk...

01:35:08.786 --> 01:35:10.709
"the Law runneth over and back.

01:35:10.872 --> 01:35:12.715
"For the strength of the Pack..."

01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:17.212
This is nice up here.

01:35:18.129 --> 01:35:20.257
Now he can climb.

01:35:23.176 --> 01:35:26.396
Please don't tell me
you're about to head down.

01:35:35.104 --> 01:35:37.106
I could get used to this.

01:36:36.666 --> 01:36:38.634
Now I'm the king of the swingers

01:36:38.710 --> 01:36:40.883
Oh, the jungle VIP

01:36:41.170 --> 01:36:43.719
I've reached the top and had to stop

01:36:43.798 --> 01:36:45.721
And that's what's botherin' me

01:36:45.967 --> 01:36:47.969
I wanna be a man, man-cub

01:36:48.386 --> 01:36:50.184
And stroll right into town

01:36:50.513 --> 01:36:52.732
And be just like the other men

01:36:52.849 --> 01:36:54.647
I'm tired of monkeyin' around

01:36:54.726 --> 01:36:56.478
Oh, ooo-be do

01:36:56.561 --> 01:36:59.314
I wanna be like you-oo-oo

01:36:59.397 --> 01:37:03.402
I wanna walk like you,
talk like you too-oo-oo

01:37:03.651 --> 01:37:08.498
You'll see it's true-oo-oo,
someone like me-ee-ee

01:37:08.573 --> 01:37:13.249
Can learn to be
like someone like you-oo-oo

01:37:13.328 --> 01:37:15.922
Now, don't try to kid me, man-cub

01:37:15.997 --> 01:37:17.590
I'll make a deal with you

01:37:17.874 --> 01:37:20.423
What I desire is man's red fire

01:37:20.543 --> 01:37:22.420
To make my dream come true

01:37:22.545 --> 01:37:24.673
Now give me the secret, man-cub

01:37:24.756 --> 01:37:26.758
Come on! Clue me what to do

01:37:26.924 --> 01:37:29.598
Give me the power of man's Red Flower

01:37:29.677 --> 01:37:31.270
So I can be like you

01:37:31.429 --> 01:37:33.102
Oh, ooo-be do

01:37:33.389 --> 01:37:36.108
I wanna be like you-oo-oo

01:37:36.184 --> 01:37:40.280
I wanna walk like you,
talk like you too-oo-oo

01:37:40.355 --> 01:37:45.111
You'll see it's true-oo-oo,
someone like me-ee-ee

01:37:45.401 --> 01:37:49.577
Can learn to be
like someone like you-oo-oo

01:38:26.901 --> 01:38:29.996
Now you might think
it's ridiculous that me

01:38:30.113 --> 01:38:32.832
A Gigantopithecus, would ever dream

01:38:32.907 --> 01:38:35.911
I'd like to team with
the likes of you, man-cub

01:38:36.077 --> 01:38:38.250
But together we'd have powers

01:38:38.329 --> 01:38:40.627
All the Jungle's treasures, ours

01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:41.837
I got desire

01:38:41.958 --> 01:38:42.925
You got the fire

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.798
But the dream I dream takes two

01:38:44.961 --> 01:38:46.679
So, oo-oo-oo

01:38:46.838 --> 01:38:49.387
I wanna be like you-oo-oo

01:38:49.507 --> 01:38:51.134
I wanna use that flame

01:38:51.217 --> 01:38:53.720
Just the same as you can do

01:38:53.845 --> 01:38:56.189
Oh, how magnificus it would be

01:38:56.347 --> 01:38:58.566
A Gigantopithecus like me

01:38:58.808 --> 01:39:00.185
Could learn to do

01:39:00.309 --> 01:39:03.313
Like you humans do-oo-oo

01:39:03.396 --> 01:39:07.697
Can learn to be
like someone like you-oo-oo

01:39:07.859 --> 01:39:12.706
Can learn to be like someone like me-ee-ee

01:39:22.915 --> 01:39:27.170
Trust in me

01:39:27.545 --> 01:39:31.391
Just in me

01:39:32.091 --> 01:39:36.267
Shut your eyes

01:39:36.554 --> 01:39:41.105
Trust in me

01:39:41.267 --> 01:39:45.238
You can sleep

01:39:45.563 --> 01:39:50.364
Safe and sound

01:39:50.443 --> 01:39:57.452
Knowing I am around

01:40:00.578 --> 01:40:04.708
Slip into silent slumber

01:40:05.249 --> 01:40:09.755
Sail on a silver mist

01:40:09.921 --> 01:40:12.970
Slowly and surely your senses

01:40:13.090 --> 01:40:17.937
Will cease to resist

01:40:18.095 --> 01:40:22.396
Just relax

01:40:22.767 --> 01:40:27.273
Be at rest

01:40:27.438 --> 01:40:31.443
Like a bird

01:40:31.901 --> 01:40:35.781
In a nest

01:40:36.489 --> 01:40:40.915
Trust in me

01:40:41.077 --> 01:40:45.127
Just in me

01:40:45.665 --> 01:40:49.761
Shut your eyes

01:40:50.086 --> 01:40:53.966
And trust in me

01:41:12.984 --> 01:41:16.614
Trust in me

01:41:17.154 --> 01:41:21.159
Just in me

01:41:22.159 --> 01:41:26.164
Shut your eyes

01:41:26.289 --> 01:41:31.216
And trust in me

01:41:57.320 --> 01:41:58.993
Yeah

01:42:03.576 --> 01:42:07.706
Look for the bare necessities

01:42:08.205 --> 01:42:11.049
The simple bare necessities

01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:14.094
Forget about your worries

01:42:14.211 --> 01:42:15.679
And your strife

01:42:16.922 --> 01:42:21.052
I mean the bare necessities

01:42:21.218 --> 01:42:24.688
Old Mother Nature's recipes

01:42:24.764 --> 01:42:29.019
That bring the bare necessities of life

01:42:30.353 --> 01:42:35.905
Wherever I wander, wherever I roam

01:42:37.234 --> 01:42:40.329
I couldn't be fonder

01:42:40.404 --> 01:42:42.782
Of my big home

01:42:43.741 --> 01:42:45.539
The bees are buzzing

01:42:45.618 --> 01:42:47.336
In the tree

01:42:47.411 --> 01:42:50.585
To make some honey just for me

01:42:51.165 --> 01:42:54.760
When you look under the rocks and plants

01:42:54.919 --> 01:42:57.923
And take a glance at them fancy ants

01:42:58.130 --> 01:43:00.349
And then maybe try a few

01:43:00.591 --> 01:43:03.936
The bare necessities of life

01:43:04.095 --> 01:43:06.518
They'll come to you!

01:43:07.014 --> 01:43:11.565
Look for the bare necessities

01:43:11.644 --> 01:43:14.614
The simple bare necessities

01:43:14.814 --> 01:43:17.283
Forget about your worries

01:43:17.358 --> 01:43:18.951
And your strife

01:43:20.277 --> 01:43:24.453
I mean the bare necessities

01:43:24.782 --> 01:43:27.831
That's why a bear can rest at ease

01:43:27.993 --> 01:43:32.294
With just the bare necessities of life

01:43:33.624 --> 01:43:36.047
So just relax

01:43:37.128 --> 01:43:39.301
In my backyard

01:43:40.297 --> 01:43:42.971
If you act like that bee acts

01:43:43.843 --> 01:43:46.562
You're working too hard

01:43:47.054 --> 01:43:50.228
Don't spend your time just looking around

01:43:51.392 --> 01:43:54.646
For something you want that can't be found

01:43:54.854 --> 01:43:58.199
When you find out you can live without it

01:43:58.315 --> 01:44:01.569
And go along not thinking about it

01:44:01.819 --> 01:44:03.821
I'll tell you something true

01:44:04.238 --> 01:44:07.037
The bare necessities of life

01:44:07.742 --> 01:44:10.746
The bare necessities of life

01:44:11.412 --> 01:44:13.039
Will come to you

01:44:14.832 --> 01:44:18.837
Water, air, love

01:44:21.338 --> 01:44:26.060
House with a roof above

01:44:26.677 --> 01:44:31.524
Talking 'bout the bare necessities of life

01:44:31.599 --> 01:44:35.194
Wisdom, understanding, sleep

01:44:37.855 --> 01:44:41.951
Good health is something you must keep

01:44:43.194 --> 01:44:47.244
Forget about your worries and your strife

01:44:48.699 --> 01:44:53.876
These are the bare necessities of life

01:45:13.390 --> 01:45:17.566
Yeah

01:45:19.230 --> 01:45:22.575
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

01:45:23.305 --> 01:45:29.832
