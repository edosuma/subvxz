MATURE JENNY: 'As nurses
and midwives,

01:14.560 --> 01:16.840
'we were adept of silence.

01:16.840 --> 01:19.680
'We shared much with those
we cared for

01:19.680 --> 01:22.240
'and saw more
than we could ever say.'

'Who could we turn to

01:29.400 --> 01:32.080
'when our hearts were full?

01:32.080 --> 01:34.760
'Who could reassure us
when we were afraid?'

01:38.520 --> 01:41.680
Where are you off to,
Sister Monica Joan?

01:41.680 --> 01:44.000
I am going to chapel,

01:44.000 --> 01:47.800
as I do numerous times a day,
every day.

01:47.800 --> 01:50.080
Routine is man's saviour, Fred.

01:50.080 --> 01:52.920
It's just that you're not wearing
your habit, Sister Monica Joan.

01:52.920 --> 01:54.240
I most certainly am!

02:00.520 --> 02:01.880
Not a thread.

02:04.720 --> 02:06.000
Easily done.

02:07.120 --> 02:08.160
No.

02:09.759 --> 02:12.920
I would never make my pilgrimage
to chapel without...

02:17.880 --> 02:20.560
Would you not breathe a word?

02:20.560 --> 02:22.760
There would be utterances.

02:22.760 --> 02:24.680
Of course.

02:24.680 --> 02:26.080
Thank you, Fred.

03:02.680 --> 03:06.400
That'll be the fourth time today,
Miss Masterson.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.480
You must be drinking
too much tea in the morning.

03:08.480 --> 03:09.880
I'm sorry, Mrs Flynn.

03:09.880 --> 03:11.720
Go. I don't want a puddle.

03:11.720 --> 03:13.160
Thank you.

03:13.160 --> 03:20.320
60 seconds. One alligator,
two alligator, three alligator...

SHE SIGHS

04:13.560 --> 04:15.280
Comfortable there, Mrs Tate?

04:16.680 --> 04:20.399
I bet you didn't think you'd get
that cape finished before baby came.

04:20.399 --> 04:22.520
Oh, Nurse, you'd think
I'd know the difference

04:22.520 --> 04:24.680
between a false alarm
and the real thing by now.

04:24.680 --> 04:26.800
I've only done it five times before.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.680
SHE COUGHS

04:28.680 --> 04:31.000
That's a nasty cough.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.040
Had it for ages. It'll pass.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.760
SHE COUGHS

04:40.680 --> 04:42.440
I'm going to fetch Doctor.

04:56.840 --> 04:58.280
BELL TINKLES

05:21.480 --> 05:24.160
Mrs Tate is my third case this week.

05:24.160 --> 05:27.480
Which says to me,
we have a new epidemic on our hands.

05:27.480 --> 05:30.760
Doctor, TB has never been choosy.

05:30.760 --> 05:33.160
It's everywhere in Poplar.
Always has been.

05:33.160 --> 05:35.920
Not this bad. Not in my time.

05:35.920 --> 05:39.360
Sister, I'm getting there too late.

05:39.360 --> 05:41.320
You can't know
they have the disease.

05:41.320 --> 05:44.320
Unless they are screened. Early.

05:45.320 --> 05:47.560
The Mass X-ray Programme?

05:47.560 --> 05:50.120
It's coming, but who knows when?

05:50.120 --> 05:53.400
We need that van now.

05:53.400 --> 05:56.120
Heavens, we are the most
over-populated corner of London!

05:56.120 --> 05:59.560
Indeed. And these are the cases
we can see.

05:59.560 --> 06:02.200
I've asked to see the board,

06:02.200 --> 06:05.280
and I shall try to make a case
for a van to come to Poplar

06:05.280 --> 06:07.040
as a matter of urgency.

06:07.040 --> 06:10.480
You have the full support
of Nonnatus House, Doctor.

06:10.480 --> 06:12.160
Whatever you need.

06:12.160 --> 06:13.760
It's worth a try.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Got my letter, then?

06:29.000 --> 06:30.760
You a slow reader or something?

06:30.760 --> 06:32.160
I came as soon as I could.

06:40.480 --> 06:41.600
Prepare yourself.

06:55.360 --> 06:57.160
HE MURMURS

06:59.880 --> 07:01.280
Terry?

07:01.280 --> 07:03.000
It's Julia, Dad.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.240
Who?

07:05.920 --> 07:07.800
Julia.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.200
Your daughter.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.320
Well, well, well.

07:13.960 --> 07:15.480
Heard you were under the weather.

07:15.480 --> 07:18.120
Illness always flushes out
the guilty.

07:19.240 --> 07:20.360
I wanted to see you.

07:20.360 --> 07:21.480
Like your mother.

07:22.760 --> 07:24.600
Hopeless liar.

07:24.600 --> 07:26.280
What's the doctor said?

07:26.280 --> 07:27.360
No doctors.

07:29.200 --> 07:31.000
You still working in that pub?

07:31.000 --> 07:33.080
No. I went to college.

07:33.080 --> 07:34.960
I got a job at a typing pool.

07:34.960 --> 07:36.880
Typing pool?

07:36.880 --> 07:39.080
Downhill all the way, then.

07:40.480 --> 07:41.840
Something like that.

07:44.680 --> 07:46.880
You need to see a doctor, Dad.

07:46.880 --> 07:48.200
You need proper care.

07:48.200 --> 07:50.720
Don't you come in here,
all Miss La-De-Bloody-Da,

07:50.720 --> 07:53.400
after six years of nothing,
and tell me what I need.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.640
I thought it was five. It's six.

07:57.160 --> 07:58.320
Six.

08:00.760 --> 08:02.400
You'll be wanting to get off.

08:17.920 --> 08:19.120
You're outrageous!

08:19.120 --> 08:20.640
SHE CHUCKLES

08:20.640 --> 08:23.680
They're wildly uncomfortable,
but I don't care a jot.

08:23.680 --> 08:26.680
Where on earth did you get those?

08:26.680 --> 08:27.880
SHE CHUCKLES

08:27.880 --> 08:32.120
Dolcis. Do they make me
walk like Marilyn Monroe?

08:32.120 --> 08:34.200
You'd have to chop
a bit of that heel off.

08:34.200 --> 08:36.159
Is that how she does it??

08:36.159 --> 08:37.559
Quarter of an inch.

08:37.559 --> 08:40.320
I read it in Woman's Realm.
Helps with the wiggle.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.440
SHE CHUCKLES

08:41.440 --> 08:42.960
Right. Where's Fred?

08:42.960 --> 08:45.400
You can't chop the heel off
a brand new pair of shoes!

08:45.400 --> 08:48.240
Fred!
If it's good enough for Marilyn...!

08:48.240 --> 08:49.840
Somebody call?

08:49.840 --> 08:53.760
Can you lop a quarter of an inch
off that heel, Fred?

08:53.760 --> 08:55.080
You'd be wrecking them!

08:55.080 --> 08:57.280
Well, it's all in the name
of an improved wiggle.

08:57.280 --> 08:59.160
They're brand spanking new!

08:59.160 --> 09:00.880
SHE SIGHS

09:00.880 --> 09:03.240
All right, you win.

09:03.240 --> 09:05.920
I don't know how you can walk
in those things.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.560
I'd feel a bit vertiginous myself.

09:08.560 --> 09:10.880
Ah, Fred does hate heights.

09:10.880 --> 09:12.520
THEY CHUCKLE

09:31.960 --> 09:36.560
Oi. Knock, knock. Why haven't you
ordered gin?

09:36.560 --> 09:38.320
It's August, Terry.

09:38.320 --> 09:42.440
Think. Women drink twice as much
when their kids are off school.

09:42.440 --> 09:44.920
Crawling all over them.

09:44.920 --> 09:46.560
HE GASPS

09:46.560 --> 09:48.360
Good job I'm hanging on, innit?

09:48.360 --> 09:50.800
HE GASPS

09:50.800 --> 09:52.960
Keeping an eye on my castle...

09:52.960 --> 09:54.520
Terry, get down here, will you?!

09:54.520 --> 09:56.800
There's someone here for the Master.

09:56.800 --> 09:58.680
Don't you go running off.

09:58.680 --> 10:01.080
HE CHUCKLES

10:01.080 --> 10:04.240
HE GASPS

10:05.640 --> 10:06.760
Follow me.

10:15.720 --> 10:17.680
Good evening, Mr Masterson.

10:17.680 --> 10:20.160
I will not have doctors in my pub!

10:20.160 --> 10:22.600
Lost your blinkin' memory, have you?

10:22.600 --> 10:25.160
Who called you? I did.

10:25.160 --> 10:26.760
I told her, sir.

10:26.760 --> 10:30.000
She needs the inside and the outside
of her head examining.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.520
Your wrist, please?

10:31.520 --> 10:33.480
Too tired.

10:36.640 --> 10:38.640
Your pulse is fast.

10:38.640 --> 10:41.120
I'd just like to examine your neck.

10:41.120 --> 10:42.920
Just tip your head to the right.

10:44.320 --> 10:45.960
What are you looking at?

10:45.960 --> 10:47.360
That's it.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.640
And your legs?

10:53.640 --> 10:55.120
Swollen.

10:55.120 --> 10:57.000
Could you lean forward a little?

10:59.680 --> 11:01.280
I need to check your back.

11:01.280 --> 11:03.960
Lean right forward
if you can manage.

11:07.520 --> 11:10.560
We need to get this sore dressed.

11:10.560 --> 11:13.200
Are you comfortable here?
At the pub?

11:13.200 --> 11:14.520
Perfectly.

11:14.520 --> 11:16.120
What? Doctor, he can't stay here.

11:16.120 --> 11:17.600
I disagree.

11:17.600 --> 11:18.920
To move him now might have

11:18.920 --> 11:20.640
a detrimental effect.

11:20.640 --> 11:24.200
But he needs to be in hospital.
No! You need me to be in hospital.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.280
So then you can get out of there.

11:26.280 --> 11:30.480
Miss Masterson,
your father needs somebody here.

11:30.480 --> 11:32.320
He needs constant care.

11:34.240 --> 11:35.400
I can stay tonight.

11:39.960 --> 11:42.600
A nurse will be with you tomorrow.

11:42.600 --> 11:47.280
Miss Masterson, your father may need
you for more than one night.

11:47.280 --> 11:49.240
It's not possible.

11:49.240 --> 11:51.520
I was only planning
to be here for an hour.

11:51.520 --> 11:53.840
I have a job. A life.

11:53.840 --> 11:55.640
I certainly will be leaving tomorrow.

11:55.640 --> 11:57.080
He'll do very well without me.

11:57.080 --> 11:58.720
Let me be clear.

11:58.720 --> 12:03.680
I believe his heart attack two years
ago caused irreversible damage.

12:03.680 --> 12:07.440
Had he attended his appointments
or been open to advice,

12:07.440 --> 12:10.360
we may have been able
to slow down this process.

12:10.360 --> 12:12.000
What process?

12:12.000 --> 12:14.680
The care that I am offering
is palliative care.

12:16.040 --> 12:17.400
His heart is failing.

12:18.960 --> 12:20.320
Your father is dying.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.560
I see.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.240
As I said, I can stay tonight.

12:30.240 --> 12:31.520
Thank you for coming.

12:35.120 --> 12:37.120
Who's pinched all the clamps?

12:37.120 --> 12:39.000
Sorry, not guilty.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.720
Well, they must have grown legs
and marched off by themselves.

12:42.720 --> 12:46.080
I am covering appointments
for Sister Julienne this morning.

12:46.080 --> 12:48.760
And shall be making a trip to
County Hall with Doctor Turner.

12:48.760 --> 12:52.200
Cynthia, could you take another
maternity pack to the Skevingtons

12:52.200 --> 12:55.200
as their pet mouse appears to have
nibbled their last one? Yes, Sister.

12:55.200 --> 12:58.960
Nurse Lee, it's said Mr Masterson
has a slight manner about him.

12:58.960 --> 13:02.400
But I know you can manage
the tricky ones without help.

13:02.400 --> 13:05.000
Thank you. Toughening up, I hope.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.440
You've learnt much, Nurse.

13:06.440 --> 13:08.320
You should be proud of yourself.

13:10.480 --> 13:11.840
Clamp thief!

13:23.720 --> 13:25.320
Sister Bernadette.

13:25.320 --> 13:26.800
Doctor Turner.

13:28.680 --> 13:31.120
I... I was expecting Sister Julienne.

13:31.120 --> 13:34.080
Sister Julienne has been called out.
I am covering for her.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.360
I see.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.880
I'm sorry I'm a little late.

13:38.880 --> 13:41.320
I couldn't find a decent tie.

13:41.320 --> 13:44.960
That tie seems
perfectly...appropriate.

13:44.960 --> 13:47.000
Thank you.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.360
I do appreciate your support today.

13:49.360 --> 13:53.040
I am here as a favour
to Sister Julienne. That is all.

13:53.040 --> 13:54.320
Of course.

14:04.560 --> 14:06.000
CAR ENGINE STARTS

14:08.200 --> 14:09.600
The nurse is here, Dad.

14:11.240 --> 14:15.200
Mr Masterson, I'm Nurse Lee.

14:15.200 --> 14:16.840
I'm here to give you an injection,

14:16.840 --> 14:20.000
and to keep an eye on your legs,
and check the sore on your shoulder.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.760
Oh, goody gumdrops.

14:22.760 --> 14:26.040
I'll be coming in every morning,
early, to get you clean,

14:26.040 --> 14:27.760
tidy and comfortable.

14:27.760 --> 14:29.040
I'll leave you to it.

14:29.040 --> 14:31.240
Oh, you don't have to.
Do stay if you want to.

14:31.240 --> 14:32.600
She doesn't.

14:35.840 --> 14:38.080
Have you got children, Nurse?

14:38.080 --> 14:40.160
No, I haven't.

14:40.160 --> 14:42.080
Lucky old you.

14:42.080 --> 14:43.800
SHE SIGHS

14:43.800 --> 14:45.680
I'm sure you don't mean that.

14:45.680 --> 14:47.200
Children are everything.

14:48.760 --> 14:50.640
You don't know, do you, Nurse?

14:50.640 --> 14:52.480
I lost all my children...

14:52.480 --> 14:53.560
Dad!

14:53.560 --> 14:54.680
..to TB.

14:57.760 --> 14:59.680
But you still have your daughter?

15:00.680 --> 15:04.280
Yes... God chose carefully that day.

15:04.280 --> 15:06.640
Left me with an icy cold wind.

15:12.520 --> 15:13.800
DOOR CLOSES

15:27.880 --> 15:30.000
Surely the two of you must be close?

15:31.360 --> 15:33.240
How little you know, Nurse.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.520
I lost my wife.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.880
My five sons.

15:38.880 --> 15:42.560
One, then another, then another.

15:42.560 --> 15:43.880
Good Lord.

15:43.880 --> 15:50.920
It was my youngest, Elizabeth,
so happy, so tiny.

15:51.960 --> 15:56.600
On her fourth birthday,
she just started coughing and...

15:56.600 --> 15:59.040
HE GASPS

15:59.040 --> 16:00.360
..slipped away.

16:03.640 --> 16:05.680
Julia and I were left quite alone.

16:07.440 --> 16:09.880
How dreadful for you both.

16:09.880 --> 16:13.960
She kept the light on for me,
kept me sane.

16:13.960 --> 16:18.240
And she left, just went suddenly.

16:19.720 --> 16:23.880
Wanted to make a life for herself,
away from this pub.

16:23.880 --> 16:25.360
HE GASPS

16:25.360 --> 16:26.960
That girl thinks of herself.

16:26.960 --> 16:28.640
That is all.

16:28.640 --> 16:30.120
I'm sure that's not true.

16:30.120 --> 16:31.560
Oh, it is, Nurse.

16:31.560 --> 16:35.000
Even now, she can't wait
to get out that door!

16:35.000 --> 16:37.800
HE GASPS

16:37.800 --> 16:39.120
DOOR CLOSES

16:41.200 --> 16:43.120
Miss Masterson, are you leaving?

16:43.120 --> 16:44.800
He'll manage without me.

16:44.800 --> 16:47.040
From what Mr Masterson told me,

16:47.040 --> 16:49.560
I would understand
if you wanted to run.

16:49.560 --> 16:50.960
I can't stay in this pub.

16:57.520 --> 16:58.960
You're all he has left.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.280
He's your father

17:02.280 --> 17:03.920
and he's still here.

17:07.280 --> 17:08.960
SHE SIGHS

17:08.960 --> 17:10.760
You all right? You look faint.

17:10.760 --> 17:12.560
I'm not the patient, Nurse Lee.

17:17.359 --> 17:19.800
Miss Masterson,
forgive me for asking...

17:22.119 --> 17:24.000
Are you expecting a child?

17:28.200 --> 17:29.560
Am I wrong?

17:34.960 --> 17:37.440
The office will lay me off
if I'm discovered.

17:37.440 --> 17:39.880
I can't afford not to work.

17:39.880 --> 17:41.800
I certainly didn't want him knowing.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.640
How far gone are you?

17:51.040 --> 17:52.360
Eight months.

17:52.360 --> 17:55.080
Eight months? You're tiny.

17:55.080 --> 17:56.520
It must be the girdle.

17:56.520 --> 17:59.720
The baby will be totally restricted!
It's terribly dangerous.

18:01.240 --> 18:03.120
Is there a fiance?

18:03.120 --> 18:04.560
No.

18:04.560 --> 18:07.640
I was hoping my wedding bouquet might
have been a bit bigger than most,

18:07.640 --> 18:09.720
but...it happens, doesn't it?

18:09.720 --> 18:12.040
I was about to tell
Frank about the baby,

18:12.040 --> 18:14.640
when he told me he was marrying
his sweetheart.

18:14.640 --> 18:17.040
It's funny.
I thought I was his sweetheart.

18:20.840 --> 18:22.760
Can you lie down on the bed, please?

18:22.760 --> 18:24.120
Nurse, I had to wear it.

18:25.440 --> 18:26.680
I need my job.

18:28.080 --> 18:31.800
I understand. I do.

18:31.800 --> 18:33.640
But this can't go back on.

18:33.640 --> 18:34.680
Promise?

18:48.400 --> 18:50.680
Sir, with respect,

18:50.680 --> 18:54.160
we need an X-ray van in Poplar now.

18:54.160 --> 18:57.720
While the disease remains
undetected, patients will die.

18:57.720 --> 19:01.240
Patients do die sometimes, Dr Turner.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.680
I would say that was
an occupational hazard.

19:03.680 --> 19:09.240
Sir, I have just diagnosed a heavily
pregnant patient with advanced TB.

19:09.240 --> 19:10.840
She has five children.

19:11.920 --> 19:15.080
She might well die,
because I didn't know she was ill.

19:16.840 --> 19:20.960
You know that TB need no longer be
a death sentence.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.800
We can treat it.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.280
But we have to get in early

19:24.280 --> 19:26.480
so people have the chance
to recover.

19:26.480 --> 19:31.120
We don't seem to be making
much ground here, do we?

19:31.120 --> 19:33.080
We are stating, plainly,

19:33.080 --> 19:37.040
that this is a highly complex,
logistical programme.

19:37.040 --> 19:39.120
The vans ARE coming to London.

19:39.120 --> 19:40.440
Where to?

19:40.440 --> 19:42.480
Mayfair? Chelsea?

19:42.480 --> 19:45.120
What, pray, are you suggesting?

19:45.120 --> 19:46.840
Have you ever been to Poplar?

19:47.840 --> 19:48.960
No.

19:48.960 --> 19:51.640
In Poplar, we might have
up to a dozen people

19:51.640 --> 19:54.880
living in one small house
or tenement flat.

19:54.880 --> 19:58.640
When conditions are over-crowded
and unventilated,

19:58.640 --> 20:00.800
infection spreads with ease.

20:00.800 --> 20:04.720
Meanwhile, someone who is infected
unwittingly takes the disease

20:04.720 --> 20:08.520
to an over-crowded production line
and transmits it to his colleagues.

20:08.520 --> 20:13.080
And even if they re-infected
just 20 fellow workers a year,

20:13.080 --> 20:15.560
which would be a very
conservative estimate,

20:15.560 --> 20:19.320
that means 20 whole families
exposed to the disease.

20:19.320 --> 20:20.800
Including children!

20:20.800 --> 20:23.400
So, while you plan
your "highly complex programme",

20:23.400 --> 20:25.960
the disease is travelling.

20:25.960 --> 20:27.520
We can fight it,

20:27.520 --> 20:29.640
but we do need that van now.

20:29.640 --> 20:30.920
Right.

20:32.040 --> 20:35.920
Doctor Turner and Sister Bernadette
have made their point.

20:35.920 --> 20:38.680
We shall have to give this
some consideration.

20:42.760 --> 20:47.520
Congratulations, Dr Turner.
You were really quite tremendous.

20:47.520 --> 20:48.680
As were you, Sister.

20:59.160 --> 21:01.560
I wish I had been there.
It sounds terribly dramatic.

21:01.560 --> 21:04.560
Doctor Turner sounds
like he was quite the hero.

21:04.560 --> 21:05.760
Quite.

21:05.760 --> 21:08.160
I'm deeply grateful to
you for stepping in, Sister.

21:08.160 --> 21:10.160
You more than deserve
the last Scotch egg.

21:10.160 --> 21:11.360
DOORBELL RINGS

21:11.360 --> 21:12.760
Be a fat lot of work.

21:12.760 --> 21:15.480
We're already stretched
to full pelt as it is.

21:15.480 --> 21:20.080
If anyone is not prepared to work,
let them not eat.

21:20.080 --> 21:22.120
'Good evening. This way, Doctor.
Thank you.'

21:22.120 --> 21:25.960
When you speak of the sun,
so it shines.

21:25.960 --> 21:30.040
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but felt I must come at once.

21:30.040 --> 21:32.760
They are sending a van to Poplar
a week next Tuesday.

21:32.760 --> 21:34.000
ALL: Oh!

21:34.000 --> 21:35.720
That is truly marvellous news.

21:35.720 --> 21:37.080
Wonderful!

21:37.080 --> 21:39.680
And so, the gamma-rays
enter our galaxy.

21:39.680 --> 21:41.000
Hang on a giddy minute.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.520
They're sending a van on the day
of the Antenatal Clinic?

21:43.520 --> 21:45.440
Indeed. Not wholly convenient.

21:45.440 --> 21:48.200
Yes. Well, we shall just have
to manage.

21:48.200 --> 21:49.960
I'd like to know how.

21:49.960 --> 21:53.560
Sister Evangelina
could control the masses.

21:53.560 --> 21:56.960
She has a voice somewhat
reminiscent of a...

21:56.960 --> 21:58.600
foghorn!

21:58.600 --> 22:00.160
THEY CHUCKLE

22:00.160 --> 22:01.360
BICYCLE BELL TINKLES

22:02.560 --> 22:04.200
Right, Mr Masterson.

22:04.200 --> 22:06.720
We're going to see if any
of this fluid is reducing today.

22:06.720 --> 22:10.160
Ooh, you spoil me, Nurse Lee.

22:10.160 --> 22:11.560
HE CHUCKLES

22:13.640 --> 22:14.880
I'll leave you to it.

22:14.880 --> 22:16.240
There she goes again.

22:16.240 --> 22:20.320
Little Miss Selfish
with her own fish to fry...

22:20.320 --> 22:24.160
Just stop. Stop. I can't stand it.

22:24.160 --> 22:27.040
My family died too! Remember?

22:27.040 --> 22:28.360
I couldn't stay here.

22:28.360 --> 22:29.720
So selfish.

22:29.720 --> 22:31.200
No, I'm not.

22:31.200 --> 22:32.840
I couldn't stand being near you!

22:32.840 --> 22:34.960
Could we have some calm, please?

22:39.200 --> 22:40.240
Good.

22:41.200 --> 22:43.440
Now, Miss Masterson,
I'm going to teach you

22:43.440 --> 22:45.840
how to give your father
some lymphatic massage.

22:48.040 --> 22:50.520
It will help with the build-up
of fluid,

22:50.520 --> 22:52.560
and take the pressure off his heart.

22:52.560 --> 22:57.880
So, if I'm not here,
you can help relieve him.

22:57.880 --> 22:58.960
And lift...

23:00.400 --> 23:01.800
No, I don't think I should.

23:01.800 --> 23:03.120
It will really help.

23:03.120 --> 23:04.840
I'd prefer if you did it, Nurse.

23:04.840 --> 23:08.040
Oh, for goodness' sake! You're both
as bad as each other! Now, come on.

23:11.280 --> 23:13.160
It'll be over before you know it.

23:29.160 --> 23:30.880
Now, Miss Masterson,

23:30.880 --> 23:35.360
would you place your hands
on your father's ankle, like this?

23:38.600 --> 23:39.640
Go on.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.600
And push up towards the knee.

23:48.080 --> 23:49.440
Bottom to top.

23:51.720 --> 23:53.280
Firmer than that.

23:53.280 --> 23:54.440
Hopeless.

23:54.440 --> 23:56.880
Mr Masterson,
could you refrain from speaking

23:56.880 --> 23:59.160
while we do our work, please?
Thank you.

24:00.880 --> 24:02.120
Off you go.

24:04.480 --> 24:06.400
Grasp the ankle

24:06.400 --> 24:09.440
and push up firmly towards the knee.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.200
And again.

24:13.200 --> 24:14.560
Keep going.

24:14.560 --> 24:16.040
SHE SIGHS

24:16.040 --> 24:17.200
And again.

24:18.720 --> 24:21.200
Good, now the other one.

24:26.560 --> 24:29.840
Do the same again, firm movements.

24:34.320 --> 24:35.520
That's it.

24:37.360 --> 24:39.320
Good. And rest.

24:41.040 --> 24:42.880
Now, that wasn't so bad, was it?

24:42.880 --> 24:44.040
Excuse me.

24:47.240 --> 24:48.840
I won't let her leave.

24:55.120 --> 24:57.200
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

24:58.600 --> 25:00.120
I don't know what you mean.

25:03.600 --> 25:05.880
About that baby of yours,

25:05.880 --> 25:08.640
I'd like you to come
for an antenatal appointment.

25:08.640 --> 25:10.000
I can't.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.120
That baby is coming out

25:12.120 --> 25:16.080
and the sooner you come to terms
with that, the better.

25:16.080 --> 25:18.080
This isn't how I wanted it to be.

25:18.080 --> 25:19.480
I wanted to come back one day,

25:19.480 --> 25:21.720
show him that I'd made something
of myself.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.840
Make him proud.

25:23.840 --> 25:25.920
I haven't got a hope in hell
of that now.

25:25.920 --> 25:28.240
Maybe he will feel some shame.

25:31.120 --> 25:33.760
But this would be
his first grandchild.

25:35.080 --> 25:37.640
That's quite a legacy
to give a dying man.

25:41.000 --> 25:45.600
There's an Antenatal and Baby Clinic
tomorrow at the Parish Hall.

25:45.600 --> 25:46.640
Come.

25:53.880 --> 25:56.480
She'd better come. Otherwise,
I'll pop her in a wheelbarrow

25:56.480 --> 25:57.920
and push her down there myself.

25:57.920 --> 25:59.520
Ow! Sorry!

25:59.520 --> 26:01.440
You could leave my hair in pins
for a week

26:01.440 --> 26:03.840
and it would still be
poker-straight.

26:03.840 --> 26:05.920
I'm destined never to curl.

26:05.920 --> 26:10.080
But, at least, you'll have a scalp,
Cynthia. I presently do not.

26:10.080 --> 26:12.000
Heaven knows what
Mr Masterson will say

26:12.000 --> 26:13.440
when he finds out she's pregnant.

26:13.440 --> 26:17.800
In a fix and unmarried, she'll
certainly be the talk of the pub.

26:17.800 --> 26:19.920
Do you think there'll be
an awful scene?

26:19.920 --> 26:23.160
I bet he loves her really.
Love without question.

26:23.160 --> 26:24.880
That's what makes the world go round.

26:24.880 --> 26:26.280
Ow!

26:26.280 --> 26:28.560
Sorry, Trixie. Beauty is pain!

26:28.560 --> 26:31.320
Just wait until I do your hair,
Jenny Lee!

26:31.320 --> 26:33.280
Death by hairpins!

26:33.280 --> 26:34.600
SHE LAUGHS

26:36.280 --> 26:38.600
Won't catch me going anywhere
near that X-ray van.

26:38.600 --> 26:40.440
Rotten for baby's health,
apparently.

26:40.440 --> 26:42.280
Rumours are not to be believed.

26:42.280 --> 26:45.520
X-rays are extremely low-risk
to an established pregnancy.

26:45.520 --> 26:47.880
Indeed, you are putting
your child at greater risk

26:47.880 --> 26:49.520
by not having the X-ray.

26:52.280 --> 26:53.440
Oh, dear.

26:53.440 --> 26:56.400
I fear we may need to up
our game a little. Indeed.

26:59.320 --> 27:01.440
Miss Masterson!

27:01.440 --> 27:03.640
Welcome. You look well.

27:03.640 --> 27:05.440
I feel like a trolleybus.

27:05.440 --> 27:06.960
This way.

27:06.960 --> 27:10.480
Julia, are you sure you're
only eight months?

27:10.480 --> 27:13.440
I'd put you more at nine.
Your baby feels low.

27:13.440 --> 27:15.200
It was Christmas Eve.

27:15.200 --> 27:17.200
I'm not going to forget
that in a hurry.

27:17.200 --> 27:20.200
Too much port and ginger
with Frank down The Cock And Bull.

27:20.200 --> 27:21.880
It couldn't have been earlier?

27:21.880 --> 27:23.520
No, I don't think so...

27:28.520 --> 27:29.760
Oh!

27:29.760 --> 27:32.280
Frank took me to a bonfire night.

27:32.280 --> 27:34.880
Bloody Catherine wheels were
popping in the field behind us.

27:34.880 --> 27:36.160
Fireworks.

27:37.440 --> 27:38.920
No more fireworks now.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.880
Any day now, then.

27:51.280 --> 27:52.960
Nurse Lee?

27:52.960 --> 27:54.640
Yes?

27:54.640 --> 27:56.760
I hope you don't mind me asking,

27:56.760 --> 27:59.800
does your father...approve of you?

28:02.560 --> 28:03.720
I think so.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.480
He was a little testy
when I moved to Poplar,

28:07.480 --> 28:09.520
but he's getting used to the idea.

28:09.520 --> 28:13.280
I often think about what it would be
like to have a proper father.

28:13.280 --> 28:14.800
One that cares.

28:14.800 --> 28:17.920
Miss Masterson,
he lost everything apart from you.

28:19.200 --> 28:24.160
So I would say that, to him,
you are most precious.

28:24.160 --> 28:25.840
Most precious indeed.

28:35.640 --> 28:36.680
Dad?

28:37.720 --> 28:39.920
Brought you some porridge.

28:39.920 --> 28:42.600
You can get rid of that flower
for a start.

28:42.600 --> 28:44.400
It'll only get knocked over.

28:49.120 --> 28:51.880
I remember you shovelling porridge in
when I was little.

28:51.880 --> 28:54.760
Sitting at the bar.
All over that account book.

28:55.800 --> 28:59.640
You counting out
the bottles on the abacus.

28:59.640 --> 29:01.360
HE GASPS

29:01.360 --> 29:03.520
You were good.

29:03.520 --> 29:05.280
Well trained.

29:05.280 --> 29:07.800
Got to keep an eye on the accounts.

29:07.800 --> 29:09.000
Trust nobody.

29:10.120 --> 29:12.080
Apart from family, maybe.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.480
Oh, God, don't look at me like that.

29:16.480 --> 29:17.920
What?

29:17.920 --> 29:19.360
SHE SIGHS

29:20.560 --> 29:21.720
Dad...

29:21.720 --> 29:23.360
You think I haven't noticed?

29:25.840 --> 29:27.720
You got anyone?

29:27.720 --> 29:28.840
He went.

29:28.840 --> 29:31.200
I'll knock his bleedin' block off.

29:31.200 --> 29:33.760
I'm so sorry, Dad.

29:33.760 --> 29:35.000
I'm sorry.

29:37.040 --> 29:38.680
I'm sorry it was only me left.

29:40.080 --> 29:44.680
I'm sorry I wasn't Mum
or Elizabeth or the boys.

29:44.680 --> 29:46.400
It was me.

29:46.400 --> 29:49.720
I'm sorry for being the one
who didn't die.

29:49.720 --> 29:52.160
What consolation
could I ever possibly be?

29:52.160 --> 29:54.520
Julia...

29:54.520 --> 29:56.520
It's just...

29:56.520 --> 30:00.120
I needed you...and you went.

30:00.120 --> 30:01.720
And I needed my dad.

30:01.720 --> 30:03.760
I lost six of my babies.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.280
I lost them too.

30:07.680 --> 30:10.240
I have a broken heart, love.

30:10.240 --> 30:11.680
I do.

30:11.680 --> 30:14.080
HE GASPS

30:14.080 --> 30:16.560
What have I done to you? Dad...

30:16.560 --> 30:19.800
HE GASPS

30:19.800 --> 30:22.240
We're very alike, you and me.

30:22.240 --> 30:25.960
I saw that in you, very early on.

30:25.960 --> 30:30.280
Stubborn, strong...

30:30.280 --> 30:32.040
Never one to back down.

30:35.920 --> 30:37.600
When's your little one due?

30:39.000 --> 30:40.200
Any day.

30:42.120 --> 30:44.200
D'you know what you're going to do?

30:48.280 --> 30:50.160
You could stay here.

30:52.160 --> 30:53.520
Please stay.

30:55.320 --> 30:56.880
Have the baby here.

30:58.480 --> 31:01.360
I should like to be able
to hold my grandchild.

31:01.360 --> 31:05.160
I'd like that very much.

31:05.160 --> 31:06.200
All right.

Morning, Sister.

32:18.920 --> 32:22.200
Ah, the X-ray cards.
Let me help you.

32:22.200 --> 32:23.360
Thank you, Sister.

32:23.360 --> 32:26.160
Oh. I do think we've been sent
rather too many.

32:26.160 --> 32:27.640
Oh, I don't think so.

32:27.640 --> 32:30.600
I think we can expect
great things from today.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.560
I'm pleased to see your optimism.

32:32.560 --> 32:35.560
You have a little spring
back in your step again, Sister.

32:35.560 --> 32:37.320
I am glad.

32:37.320 --> 32:42.120
If people come today, so many lives
and future lives will be saved.

32:42.120 --> 32:44.040
Indeed.

32:44.040 --> 32:45.320
Shall we?

32:55.800 --> 32:56.840
It's here!

32:58.440 --> 32:59.680
Oh, Lord!

32:59.680 --> 33:01.600
It's big, isn't it?

33:05.800 --> 33:08.320
I'll be able to see my little one
inside me!

33:08.320 --> 33:09.840
I can't wait.

33:09.840 --> 33:11.160
Me too.

33:11.160 --> 33:12.880
Do you think people will come?

33:12.880 --> 33:15.440
Oh, I hope so. I really do.

33:25.560 --> 33:27.120
Bloody hell.

33:32.560 --> 33:34.880
Excuse me. Excuse me.

33:40.120 --> 33:42.880
You might want to put
that crossword away, Doctor.

33:42.880 --> 33:44.880
But I've only got one left.

33:44.880 --> 33:48.240
Clue is "launch".
Begins with K, two words,

33:48.240 --> 33:49.960
second word ends with F.

33:55.120 --> 33:56.400
Kick off.

34:05.720 --> 34:07.080
Sister Monica Joan?

34:08.760 --> 34:11.960
Sister? Our X-ray appointment
is today, remember?

34:13.840 --> 34:16.000
The door is quite jammed.

34:25.880 --> 34:27.560
Oh, my.

34:27.560 --> 34:31.400
'I shall not be attending
any such X-ray machine...'

34:31.400 --> 34:32.880
I am in my Ark.

34:38.320 --> 34:40.400
There is no point in pushing, sir!

34:40.400 --> 34:42.120
I shall not topple that easily!

34:42.120 --> 34:44.320
I shall say it again.

34:44.320 --> 34:46.760
Form a queue!

34:47.960 --> 34:50.280
Oh! That means, one,

34:50.280 --> 34:52.920
and then one behind,
then another one,

34:52.920 --> 34:55.600
that's right,
and you, stay like that!

34:55.600 --> 34:57.000
Excuse me. Thank you.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.880
Have you never queued for a bus,
madam?

34:58.880 --> 35:00.760
Good morning, Doctor.

35:00.760 --> 35:02.240
Sister Bernadette.

35:02.240 --> 35:04.120
The posters worked, then.

35:04.120 --> 35:06.280
Never in my wildest dreams.

35:06.280 --> 35:09.360
A queue does mean a queue. Please!

35:09.360 --> 35:11.160
All right, good morning, everyone.

35:11.160 --> 35:12.760
ALL: Good morning!

35:12.760 --> 35:15.960
Now, you will only be in the van
a matter of moments.

35:15.960 --> 35:19.920
After we've taken your snap shot,
you will be handed your X-ray,

35:19.920 --> 35:22.560
which you must then give
to Sister Bernadette here,

35:22.560 --> 35:24.760
along with your name
and address card.

35:24.760 --> 35:26.480
Are you all right there, Sister?

35:26.480 --> 35:29.320
Oh, yes, Doctor. I was born
for days like this. Oi, you!

35:29.320 --> 35:30.840
Stand back, I say!

35:30.840 --> 35:33.920
Ah, Dr McGuinness, Sister Bernadette
will be helping us today.

35:33.920 --> 35:36.720
Marvellous. Good to know
the Lord will be with us!

35:40.320 --> 35:43.160
Ah, Fred, thank goodness.

35:43.160 --> 35:44.480
Where's Sister Julienne?

35:44.480 --> 35:45.800
Gone.

35:45.800 --> 35:48.040
Sister Monica Joan's
stuck in the bathroom.

35:48.040 --> 35:50.200
And we're due at the X-ray van
for our screening.

35:56.520 --> 35:58.680
Sister Monica Joan?
Are you all right?

35:58.680 --> 36:00.960
'Tickety-boo, thank you, Fred.'

36:00.960 --> 36:02.320
Are you?

36:06.400 --> 36:08.520
I'm going to try the door.
Stand back!

36:08.520 --> 36:10.720
Oh.

36:10.720 --> 36:12.160

settled in my Ark, Fred.

36:23.680 --> 36:26.080
'I am quite immovable.'

36:29.360 --> 36:31.360
Just get in there!
Don't want to!

36:31.360 --> 36:33.040
Just do it! No!

36:33.040 --> 36:34.960
Can I help?

36:34.960 --> 36:37.120
You won't be able to do nothing.

36:37.120 --> 36:39.000
She's just doing it to show me up.

36:40.480 --> 36:41.880
I tell you what.

36:41.880 --> 36:43.600
I don't want to go in there, either.

36:43.600 --> 36:46.240
Shall we make a pact?

36:46.240 --> 36:48.160
If you go in, I'll go in.

36:49.160 --> 36:50.280
Good.

36:51.520 --> 36:53.080
May I, Doctor?

36:53.080 --> 36:54.200
Of course.

37:13.640 --> 37:14.680
Come along.

37:29.480 --> 37:31.440
Thank you.

37:31.440 --> 37:32.920
She's only little.

37:32.920 --> 37:34.240
You're a natural.

37:35.480 --> 37:36.520
Please.

37:43.480 --> 37:44.880
I'll hold your ladder.

37:46.360 --> 37:48.960
Sister Monica Joan, can you hear me?

37:48.960 --> 37:53.440
'Hear no evil, speak no evil,
see no evil!'

37:53.440 --> 37:55.800
Well, have no fear.
Fred's coming up.

37:55.800 --> 37:57.160
We'll get you out of there.

37:57.160 --> 37:58.560
Er...

37:58.560 --> 38:00.000
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

38:00.000 --> 38:03.040
Just one tiny thing. I...

38:03.040 --> 38:06.120
I have a little problem
with heights.

38:06.120 --> 38:07.440
I see.

38:09.720 --> 38:13.080
Ordinarily, I'd be sympathetic,
Fred.

38:13.080 --> 38:15.480
But today, I'm not. What?

38:15.480 --> 38:18.000
Come on, up you go.
It won't take a minute.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.360
I can't! Up!

38:35.880 --> 38:37.320
Don't look down!

38:50.520 --> 38:52.600
Oh, oh!

38:52.600 --> 38:55.600
HE MOANS

38:55.600 --> 38:59.480
HE PANTS

39:00.760 --> 39:05.640
Sister. Noah, being warned by God
about things not seen,

39:05.640 --> 39:09.040
prepared an Ark for the salvation
of his household.

39:09.040 --> 39:14.040
Behold, the gamma rays will bring
forth a flood to this earth

39:14.040 --> 39:18.040
which will destroy all flesh
in which is the breath of life.

39:19.600 --> 39:21.880
There will be no flood, Sister.

39:21.880 --> 39:25.760
But they did not understand
the power of the atomic poison

39:25.760 --> 39:29.440
until the floods came
and took them all away.

39:33.200 --> 39:34.240
Sister...

39:35.720 --> 39:40.320
..I will bet on my life,
you need not your Ark.

39:40.320 --> 39:42.280
There's not a cloud in the sky.

39:42.280 --> 39:44.160
All is calm.

39:44.160 --> 39:47.360
And I will escort you
to and from the X-ray van,

39:47.360 --> 39:49.160
never leaving your side.

39:49.160 --> 39:51.040
How about that?

39:52.720 --> 39:54.840
Never once?

39:54.840 --> 39:55.880
Never.

40:00.600 --> 40:03.400
I appear to be in your debt, Fred.

40:03.400 --> 40:06.360
Shall we bring life belts?

40:06.360 --> 40:09.520
No need. I've got my paddle
sports activity badge.

40:13.920 --> 40:15.160
SHE SIGHS

40:15.160 --> 40:17.600

41:40.560 --> 41:43.600
Thank you, Sister.
You did wonderful work today.

41:43.600 --> 41:47.400
Forgive me, Doctor.
My glottis is a bit ragged.

41:47.400 --> 41:50.600
Doctor, could I have a word?

41:55.560 --> 41:56.960
Thank you for coming, Nurse.

41:56.960 --> 41:59.520
He's so breathless.
I didn't know what to do.

42:06.160 --> 42:08.080
His heartbeat's very fast.

42:08.080 --> 42:10.120
He might be taking
a turn for the worse.

42:10.120 --> 42:11.680
No. Not yet.

42:11.680 --> 42:13.920
He knows about the baby.

42:13.920 --> 42:15.400
He asked me to stay, Nurse.

42:15.400 --> 42:17.120
That's wonderful.

42:18.400 --> 42:20.280
Right, you massage his legs.

42:20.280 --> 42:23.560
Anything might help to relieve
the pressure on his heart.

42:31.360 --> 42:34.480
Today is a testament to you,
Doctor Turner.

42:34.480 --> 42:37.800
And to you, Sister.
I couldn't have done it without you.

42:37.800 --> 42:40.120
Everyone worked so terribly hard.

42:40.120 --> 42:43.880
Would you join us for a cup
of celebratory Horlicks?

42:43.880 --> 42:46.240
I won't, thank you, Sister.

42:46.240 --> 42:50.520
Might I see Sister Bernadette
in private?

42:50.520 --> 42:53.000
I have something
I need to discuss with her.

42:54.760 --> 42:55.920
Of course.

43:01.120 --> 43:02.600
DOOR CLOSES

43:04.440 --> 43:06.080
Dr Turner.

43:06.080 --> 43:08.760
Sister. Oh, what a day we had!

43:08.760 --> 43:09.880
Indeed.

43:11.640 --> 43:12.920
Is all well?

43:14.200 --> 43:16.240
Would you mind sitting?

43:16.240 --> 43:17.480
Of course.

43:32.480 --> 43:34.440
This has my name on it.

43:35.600 --> 43:37.080
Yes.

43:37.080 --> 43:39.480
The lesions are small.

43:39.480 --> 43:41.320
But there is more than one.

43:42.720 --> 43:44.040
I see.

43:46.400 --> 43:47.840
How many?

43:49.120 --> 43:52.880
Dr McGuinness counted nine or ten,
in the upper lobe.

43:54.880 --> 43:58.600
But, as you know,
this film is basic.

43:58.600 --> 44:01.240
You will need a more detailed
chest X-ray.

44:04.840 --> 44:07.040
Have you had any symptoms?

44:07.040 --> 44:08.600
No.

44:10.280 --> 44:12.640
Well, a little breathlessness,
maybe.

44:14.200 --> 44:16.160
No cough? No.

44:16.160 --> 44:17.560
Nothing.

44:18.920 --> 44:21.880
I will need to carry out
an examination.

44:21.880 --> 44:23.240
Yes.

45:03.160 --> 45:04.440
Breathe in.

45:07.520 --> 45:08.720
And out.

45:12.920 --> 45:14.320
And again.

45:48.600 --> 45:49.800
Crackles...

45:50.840 --> 45:52.160
..on both sides.

45:54.400 --> 45:57.000
I've arranged an X-ray
for you in the morning.

45:58.600 --> 46:01.520
It might be more convenient
if I drive you.

46:01.520 --> 46:03.120
Thank you, Doctor.

46:03.120 --> 46:04.840
You don't need to do that.

46:04.840 --> 46:06.280
I'll drive you.

46:16.440 --> 46:18.440
His heart's a little calmer.

46:18.440 --> 46:19.840
He's hanging on.

46:19.840 --> 46:21.160
Thank you.

46:25.480 --> 46:26.960
Oh!

46:28.240 --> 46:29.720
SHE SIGHS

46:29.720 --> 46:31.000
HE GASPS

46:33.960 --> 46:37.480
I think Sister Monica Joan
has a soft spot for our Fred.

46:37.480 --> 46:38.600
THEY CHUCKLE

46:38.600 --> 46:40.040
If she had a soft spot for Fred,

46:40.040 --> 46:42.520
I don't think she'd have wanted him
up that ladder!

46:42.520 --> 46:45.240
Oh, poor Fred! His worst nightmare.

46:45.240 --> 46:48.200
Well, he got her out,
which is surely the main thing.

46:51.400 --> 46:53.400
I have something I need to tell you.

47:05.320 --> 47:06.920
The milk will help you sleep.

47:06.920 --> 47:08.240
Thank you, Sister.

47:09.640 --> 47:12.000
KNOCKING ON DOOR

47:12.000 --> 47:15.240
Sister, I'm sorry to disturb you.

47:15.240 --> 47:18.720
But Nurse Lee has asked for you
to come to The Masters Arms pub
at once.

47:18.720 --> 47:21.240
Miss Masterson has gone into labour,

47:21.240 --> 47:24.920
and Mr Masterson has taken
a turn for the worse.

47:24.920 --> 47:28.360
We will fetch Sister Evangelina
and ask her to go in my place.

47:28.360 --> 47:29.480
Sister, you must go.

47:29.480 --> 47:31.200
I don't wish you to be alone.

47:31.200 --> 47:33.480
Sister, if you continue
with your work as normal,

47:33.480 --> 47:35.640
then nothing will be out of sorts.

47:35.640 --> 47:37.440
Nothing will have changed.

47:39.040 --> 47:40.400
As you wish.

47:48.800 --> 47:52.160
MURMURING

47:58.480 --> 47:59.760
Excuse me. Sorry.

48:01.920 --> 48:04.000
I thought she looked
a bit pale this morning,

48:04.000 --> 48:05.560
but she wouldn't let me do anything.

48:05.560 --> 48:06.880
Just like her dad.

48:09.280 --> 48:11.600
FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING

48:15.720 --> 48:18.280
She woke with labour pains,
but didn't let on.

48:18.280 --> 48:19.520
Her waters have broken,

48:19.520 --> 48:22.120
but Mr Masterson's so fragile
she won't leave his side.

48:22.120 --> 48:23.440
Hot water's on its way!

48:23.440 --> 48:25.760
Thank you, Terry.
End of the corridor.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.680
SHE GASPS

48:37.080 --> 48:39.880
Miss Masterson, the baby's coming.

48:39.880 --> 48:42.440
We need to get you settled,
and monitor the baby's position.

48:42.440 --> 48:43.720
I'm not leaving him!

48:43.720 --> 48:46.680
Miss Masterson, I understand
you want your father

48:46.680 --> 48:48.280
to meet his grandchild?

48:48.280 --> 48:50.040
Yes.

48:50.040 --> 48:51.760
Then let's get this baby out.

48:51.760 --> 48:54.680
I'll stay with your father,
I promise he will not be alone.

48:59.320 --> 49:00.520
Don't you dare.

49:05.440 --> 49:07.800
Sister, are you all right?

49:07.800 --> 49:09.200
SHE SIGHS

49:09.200 --> 49:11.880
It has been rather a taxing day,
Nurse.

49:11.880 --> 49:13.480
Yes, it has.

49:21.840 --> 49:24.520
It's hot in here. Need some air.

49:26.120 --> 49:30.000
It's the pub. When it's busy,
it's like a furnace up here.

49:30.000 --> 49:31.360
We need to get you on the bed.

49:34.400 --> 49:35.440
All right?

49:47.800 --> 49:49.600
Let's get you on the bed.

49:53.760 --> 49:56.280
Well, you can't stay down there,

49:56.280 --> 49:57.480
you're having a baby,

49:57.480 --> 49:58.920
not sweeping the carpet.

50:04.160 --> 50:05.880
Let's have a listen, shall we?

50:15.360 --> 50:17.960
SHE GASPS

50:22.480 --> 50:24.400
A steady 1.30.

50:24.400 --> 50:26.600
That's what we like.

50:26.600 --> 50:28.520
You must be comfortable there.

50:34.440 --> 50:35.880
Do you feel any pressure?

50:42.520 --> 50:43.800
My word, Julia.

50:43.800 --> 50:44.920
SHE GASPS

50:44.920 --> 50:47.320
I think you're entering
the second stage of labour,

50:47.320 --> 50:49.800
which means your baby is on its way.

50:49.800 --> 50:51.760
Nurse Lee, would you check on Dad?

50:51.760 --> 50:54.400
All right, just for you.

50:54.400 --> 50:56.360
But, remember, we have a job to do.

51:04.520 --> 51:07.320
She's quiet,
but I think she's in transition.

51:07.320 --> 51:10.240
She's on her knees, Sister.
Won't move.

51:10.240 --> 51:12.720
Is she comfortable? Yes.

51:12.720 --> 51:14.720
That is the main thing.

51:14.720 --> 51:16.520
How is he?

51:16.520 --> 51:19.120
His heartbeat is weak. He's fading.

51:20.840 --> 51:22.120
It's a matter of time.

51:24.400 --> 51:29.160
Mr Masterson,
your daughter has gone into labour.

51:30.320 --> 51:32.320
You're about to have a grandchild.

51:35.360 --> 51:36.680
Thank you, Terry.

51:41.960 --> 51:44.080
Your father's still with us.

51:56.280 --> 51:58.400
Right, I know you want to push,

51:58.400 --> 51:59.720
but not quite yet.

51:59.720 --> 52:02.320
Slow and steady.

52:02.320 --> 52:05.920
That's it.
Your baby's really hurtling out now.

52:05.920 --> 52:07.080
SHE GASPS

52:07.080 --> 52:09.160
I can see the baby's head.

52:09.160 --> 52:10.840
Nice deep breaths.

52:10.840 --> 52:14.600
Concentrate on breathing
just like that. That's it.

52:17.920 --> 52:20.200
If you can hear me,
please hang on, Sir.

52:22.840 --> 52:24.160
Now, then.

52:24.160 --> 52:25.920
I want you to push but not too hard.

52:25.920 --> 52:30.480
Good, deep breaths.

52:30.480 --> 52:33.320
Another big push,
as hard as you can.

52:33.320 --> 52:35.560
And that lovely head
will be with us.

52:35.560 --> 52:37.400
Keep going!

52:37.400 --> 52:39.320
That's it.

52:49.760 --> 52:52.480
All right, Julia,
one more big push for me now.

52:53.800 --> 52:55.800
And it's here.

52:55.800 --> 52:57.160
SHE MOANS

52:57.160 --> 53:02.280
That's it, this one isn't wasting
any time. That's it!

53:02.280 --> 53:05.600
BABY CRIES

53:05.600 --> 53:06.920

53:09.040 --> 53:15.680

very busy day.

53:22.160 --> 53:23.800
He's beautiful.

53:23.800 --> 53:25.720
BABY CRIES

53:30.840 --> 53:32.720
Can you take him straight to Dad?

53:38.800 --> 53:40.080
A boy.

53:42.240 --> 53:43.400
He's still breathing.

53:43.400 --> 53:45.000
Oh, thank goodness.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.200
The placenta still
needs to be delivered.

53:47.200 --> 53:48.480
Then back you go.

53:53.000 --> 53:54.400
Mr Masterson?

53:56.800 --> 53:58.440
Mr Masterson?

53:58.440 --> 54:00.360
A grandson, Mr Masterson.

54:02.600 --> 54:04.640
A boy?

54:04.640 --> 54:06.160
Yes.

54:06.160 --> 54:08.480
He appears to be rather perfect.

54:10.200 --> 54:11.560
Can I hold him?

54:24.600 --> 54:26.760
My grandson.

54:28.920 --> 54:31.800
I'm just leaving, I'm afraid.

54:31.800 --> 54:34.520
And you've just arrived.

54:34.520 --> 54:37.440
We're passing, you and...you and I.

54:50.240 --> 54:52.600
You look after your mother.

54:52.600 --> 54:55.600
Don't have her doing the barrels.
