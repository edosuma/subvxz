WEBVTT

00:24.925 --> 00:26.527
[guard 1] Why don't you ever go
to the commissary for lunch?

00:26.527 --> 00:28.228
I know I'm not
gonna like it.

00:28.228 --> 00:29.664
But they change
their menu every day.

00:29.664 --> 00:31.533
How could you possibly know
you don't like it?

00:31.533 --> 00:33.634
[guard 2] I don't
like that style
of food preparation.

00:33.634 --> 00:37.204
[guard 1]
What does that even mean?
"Style of food preparation"?

00:37.237 --> 00:41.841
[guards grunting]

00:41.875 --> 00:43.076
[groans]

00:47.314 --> 00:48.716
[guard 3] Don't worry.

00:48.749 --> 00:50.017
Without any plants around,

00:50.017 --> 00:51.351
she's just another
weak, helpless woman.

00:51.351 --> 00:54.889
Uh, who still has hands

00:54.921 --> 00:56.890
and the goddamn
Second Amendment.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.393
Obviously I support
background checks

00:58.393 --> 01:00.393
and common sense gun laws.

01:07.968 --> 01:09.903
-[alarm sounds]
-There she is.

01:09.936 --> 01:12.706
-Hey you, stop!
-Hey!

01:12.739 --> 01:16.911
[gun clicking]

01:16.944 --> 01:19.493
[breathes deeply]

01:22.783 --> 01:25.632
[breathing heavily]

01:32.927 --> 01:35.228
Shit.

01:35.263 --> 01:38.064
[tsking]
Trying to escape
on surgery day.

01:38.064 --> 01:39.033
Don't worry.

01:39.033 --> 01:41.436
Insurance will cover it.

01:41.468 --> 01:42.936
Obviously that was a joke.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.171
Insurance would
never pay for this.

01:44.171 --> 01:45.338
[stutters] I think
we can all agree

01:45.338 --> 01:46.974
they're the real
villains, yeah?

01:47.007 --> 01:50.456
I would agree with th--

01:53.748 --> 01:58.748
-[Poison Ivy sighs]
-[laughing maniacally]

02:02.724 --> 02:05.358
Ugh, it's my fault
she's in there.

02:05.393 --> 02:07.495
I can't even imagine
what they're doing to her.

02:07.528 --> 02:09.563
You don't think it's,
like, torture, right?

02:09.597 --> 02:11.132
I don't think
it's like torture.

02:11.164 --> 02:12.900
That's motherfuckin'
torture right there.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.200
Screw this.
I'm gettin' her out.

02:14.235 --> 02:15.804
That is a lot of
big boys with guns,

02:15.836 --> 02:18.239
and you're one petite
young woman with a bat.

02:18.271 --> 02:20.039
They aren't gonna
come at you one at a time.

02:20.074 --> 02:21.776
That's not how
that shit work!

02:21.810 --> 02:24.177
Mmm, that's actually
standard goon
operating procedure.

02:24.211 --> 02:25.346
[man] Excuse me.

02:25.378 --> 02:29.128
I'm so dang lost and so--

02:30.818 --> 02:33.387
Oh, they're doing
the "all at once" way now.

02:33.387 --> 02:34.388
You know what you need?

02:34.421 --> 02:36.824
-More bat?
-More crew.

02:36.856 --> 02:37.907
[sighs]

02:43.531 --> 02:45.435
<i>Hello, Gotham.</i>
<i>Riddler here.</i>

02:45.467 --> 02:48.603
Sorry to interrupt
your football match,

02:48.603 --> 02:50.606
<i>but I've hidden a bomb</i>
<i>somewhere in Gotham.</i>

02:50.606 --> 02:53.608
<i>Oh, but don't worry, Batman.</i>

02:53.640 --> 02:56.610
<i>Here's a little riddle</i>
<i>to help you find it.</i>

02:56.643 --> 02:57.944
[laughs]

02:57.978 --> 03:00.048
[clears throat]

03:00.080 --> 03:01.949
[Riddler and Clayface]
<i>You throw away the outside</i>
<i>and cook the inside.</i>

03:01.983 --> 03:05.019
<i>Then you eat the outside</i>
<i>and throw away the--</i>

03:05.051 --> 03:06.252
<i>You're doing great, boss.</i>

03:06.287 --> 03:07.889
[clears throat] <i>Mmm.</i>

03:07.921 --> 03:10.191
[Riddler and Clayface]
<i>You throw away the outside...</i>

03:10.223 --> 03:12.225
<i>Oh, sorry.</i>

03:12.258 --> 03:14.362
<i>Uh, you throw away the...</i>
[clears throat]

03:14.395 --> 03:18.032
[Riddler and Clayface]
<i>You throw away the outside</i>
<i>and cook the inside--</i>

03:18.064 --> 03:20.534
<i>What the hell are you doing?</i>

03:20.568 --> 03:22.669
<i>I just have</i>
<i>one tiny thought.</i>

03:22.704 --> 03:26.907
<i>Maybe say,</i>
<i>"Throw away the outside."</i>

03:26.942 --> 03:28.810
<i>Do you see</i>
<i>where I put the emphasis?</i>

03:28.842 --> 03:32.145
Did you just give me
a fucking line reading?

03:32.179 --> 03:33.180
We're live!

03:33.213 --> 03:34.983
Yes, this guy!

03:35.015 --> 03:38.085
Where's this guy when
you're threatening Gotham
with a riddle?

03:38.118 --> 03:39.653
Go, now, while you feel it.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.421
All right.
You know what?
Screw it. It's corn.

03:41.455 --> 03:44.658
The bomb's
at the corn factory.
Cut the feed.

03:44.692 --> 03:46.426
Uh, can I borrow
Clayface for a minute?

03:46.461 --> 03:48.062
Borrow? Take him, please.

03:48.094 --> 03:49.362
Now, forever, be gone.

03:49.396 --> 03:50.965
[Harley] Hey, Clayface!

03:50.997 --> 03:53.266
-Hmm. Ms. Quinn.
-You look great.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.534
Have you lost some clay?

03:54.568 --> 03:56.437
Yes. I'm feeling
very fulfilled.

03:56.471 --> 03:58.673
My life is thick and rich.

03:58.705 --> 04:01.040
Listen, I know I promised
to take care of you guys,

04:01.074 --> 04:03.443
instead, I left
you out to dry.

04:03.478 --> 04:05.479
You guys aren't just
a crew to me.

04:05.513 --> 04:07.381
You're the only
family I've got.

04:07.414 --> 04:10.350
You're thinking
of the number 17.

04:10.383 --> 04:13.287
Also, FYI he's banging
his assistant Denise.

04:13.320 --> 04:14.722
We are not family.

04:14.756 --> 04:16.824
You're right. I didn't
treat you like family.

04:16.824 --> 04:19.059
Well, I did, but I treated you
like my family treats people,

04:19.059 --> 04:20.394
which is bad not good.

04:20.427 --> 04:23.163
Now, Denise, do you know
your boss' password?

04:23.197 --> 04:24.966
And, yes, I heard you,

04:24.966 --> 04:27.869
but I'm passive
aggressively
not responding.

04:27.901 --> 04:30.637
All I'm asking for
is a second chance.

04:30.672 --> 04:32.372
When I got to the
Legion of Doom,

04:32.406 --> 04:34.208
I forgot that
the only reason
I was there

04:34.240 --> 04:35.975
was because of you guys.

04:36.009 --> 04:38.446
But I won't forget again.

04:38.478 --> 04:39.913
So, what do you say?

04:39.947 --> 04:41.314
-No.
-No.

04:41.348 --> 04:43.850
-Never gonna happen.
-No? Ivy's kidnapped!

04:43.884 --> 04:44.985
-What?
-Not Ivy.

04:45.019 --> 04:46.553
-We got to save her.
-Yeah.

04:46.553 --> 04:48.156
Where the hell did you learn
how to give a speech?

04:48.156 --> 04:50.557
You put your thesis statement
at the motherfuckin' top.

04:50.591 --> 04:52.060
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

04:52.060 --> 04:53.560
Look, Ivy needs us,
and I can't do it on my own.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.129
We'll help you, Harley.

04:55.161 --> 04:56.730
-Yay!
-For Ivy.

04:56.764 --> 04:58.232
-Still yay.
-And then we never

04:58.264 --> 04:59.634
want to see you
again, all right?

04:59.666 --> 05:01.769
Less yay, but more yay
than I had this morning.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.639
What's happening?
What's shakin'?
We pullin' a caper?

05:04.639 --> 05:06.473
What? No.
Where the hell you been?

05:06.507 --> 05:08.209
We broke up a week ago.

05:08.242 --> 05:10.745
What? We broke up?
I'm devastated.

05:10.778 --> 05:12.680
I thought this was
my forever crew.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.247
What the hell
are you talkin' about?

05:14.247 --> 05:15.449
You've never been
in the crew.

05:15.483 --> 05:16.918
But you can come
help rescue Ivy.

05:16.951 --> 05:19.887
Hi-ya! You won't
regret this, Harley baby.

05:19.920 --> 05:24.920
I'll do the driving!
I'm an excellent...
[snoring]

05:26.093 --> 05:27.427
Driver!

05:27.461 --> 05:30.531
Hey! Get out of the...
Ugh, you schmuck.

05:30.564 --> 05:32.601
Come on! If you
don't wanna die,

05:32.634 --> 05:35.201
get out of the road!

05:35.235 --> 05:36.637
Don't throw up,
don't throw up.

05:36.672 --> 05:38.338
[gags] Don't throw up!

05:38.372 --> 05:39.406
Stop verbalizing it.

05:39.439 --> 05:43.189
You're going to make me--

05:44.682 --> 05:48.214
I do not know
how you live
with yourself.

05:48.249 --> 05:49.649
[brakes screeching]

05:49.684 --> 05:50.718
[Dr. Psycho] Holy shit!

05:50.752 --> 05:52.786
Hey, how you doing, buddy boy?

05:52.819 --> 05:57.124
Where do you want me to set up
the pretzel wrapped wieners?

05:57.156 --> 05:58.492
[alarm blaring]

05:58.526 --> 06:00.194
[Gus] Pretzel-wrapped wieners!

06:00.226 --> 06:02.730
Oh, boy!
What's the occasion?

06:02.764 --> 06:04.997
It's a big thank you
from the boss

06:05.031 --> 06:06.934
for all your hard work.

06:06.966 --> 06:09.971
Oh, that is just...

06:10.004 --> 06:13.240
You think they don't notice,
but they notice.

06:13.274 --> 06:14.307
[inhales sharply] Mmm.

06:14.341 --> 06:16.276
It's like eating my childhood.

06:16.310 --> 06:17.711
Here, let these guys in.

06:17.745 --> 06:21.644
[sing-song] Who wants
a pretzel-wrapped wiener?

06:24.016 --> 06:25.151
Like a glove.

06:25.185 --> 06:26.987
Holy shit! It's true!

06:27.019 --> 06:28.723
Pretzel-wrapped wieners!

06:28.755 --> 06:33.755
Gentlemen and Psycho,
begin phase two.

07:03.357 --> 07:06.507
[King Shark grunting]

07:31.951 --> 07:33.221
There she is.

07:33.254 --> 07:36.223
Congratulations, Mom,
you're going to give birth

07:36.257 --> 07:38.358
to the destruction
of Gotham.

07:38.391 --> 07:39.726
My pheromones.

07:39.761 --> 07:41.060
What did you
do with them?

07:41.095 --> 07:42.262
Oh, I'd love to show you,

07:42.262 --> 07:43.363
but by the time
I unleash it,

07:43.363 --> 07:45.865
you'll be too busy screaming.

07:45.899 --> 07:46.901
[grunting]

07:46.935 --> 07:48.302
[Poison Ivy]
Oh, no, fear toxin.

07:48.334 --> 07:49.704
Didn't see that coming.

07:49.704 --> 07:52.540
Hey, shithead, poisons
don't work on me.

07:52.572 --> 07:54.007
That's, like,
literally my thing.

07:54.040 --> 07:55.175
[laughing]

07:55.209 --> 07:57.577
Which is why
I used your DNA

07:57.577 --> 08:02.577
to engineer
a special blend
just for you.

08:02.817 --> 08:04.721
Was it fun
henching for Riddler?

08:04.721 --> 08:06.019
I heard his breath smells,

08:06.019 --> 08:07.889
but the person
who told me that
had nasty breath,

08:07.922 --> 08:10.089
so he could be
an unreliable source.

08:10.124 --> 08:11.391
Guys, shut it.

08:11.425 --> 08:13.060
We can't find Ivy
if we can't hear her.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.295
[Poison Ivy screaming]

08:14.327 --> 08:15.629
That's her!
Follow me!

08:15.663 --> 08:19.067
[screaming continues]

08:19.100 --> 08:20.735
Oh, my God!
What'd they do to her?

08:20.767 --> 08:24.968
I fear they've
poisoned Ivy.

08:26.141 --> 08:27.899
Nothing?

08:27.899 --> 08:29.709
Should've saved that for
a lower-stakes situation.

08:29.709 --> 08:30.980
Ive, it's okay, we're here!

08:31.012 --> 08:32.813
Actually, it's not okay.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.548
The fear toxin's
destroying her brain.

08:35.582 --> 08:37.518
Unless we do something soon,

08:37.551 --> 08:39.653
she's gonna be
stuck like this forever.

08:39.687 --> 08:42.288
Don't worry. I know
just how to save her.

08:42.322 --> 08:44.125
Why the fuck did you do that?

08:44.125 --> 08:45.727
I had to knock her out
so we can get into her brain,

08:45.727 --> 08:48.361
like I was knocked out
when you went into mine.

08:48.394 --> 08:49.797
Uh, no.

08:49.797 --> 08:52.033
You just happened to be
knocked out before.

08:52.033 --> 08:54.100
So, really, all you've done
is punch your friend
in the face, you idiot.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.669
Oh, well, whoops.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.304
All right,
let's get in there
and fix her up.

08:57.304 --> 08:58.806
Also, let's not mention
the whole face punchin' thingy.

08:58.806 --> 09:00.509
-Let's go!
-But if we go in her brain,

09:00.542 --> 09:03.711
that'd leave
our bodies out here
all cute and unprotected.

09:03.744 --> 09:05.846
I'll protect
your cute bodies.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.448
No, no. Last time
you were alone
with our cute bodies,

09:08.481 --> 09:10.317
you tried to burn them.

09:10.351 --> 09:13.220
Hey, hey, hey,
I could've done
much worse.

09:13.253 --> 09:14.554
Come on,
get in her noggin.

09:14.587 --> 09:16.023
Evie's counting on ya.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.625
Ivy. It's Ivy!

09:17.658 --> 09:19.426
All right, we're going in.
Sy's stayin'.

09:19.460 --> 09:20.659
Hot dog!

09:24.498 --> 09:25.932
[grunts]

09:25.966 --> 09:27.466
[grunting]

09:34.240 --> 09:35.890
[screaming]

09:49.091 --> 09:50.091
Holy shit.

09:50.091 --> 09:52.028
The fear toxin
has activated

09:52.028 --> 09:53.527
all of Ivy's biggest fears.

09:53.561 --> 09:55.730
[happy tree]
Hey, guys, over here.

09:55.763 --> 09:58.235
Wow, what a beautiful day
to meet some new friends.

09:58.268 --> 10:01.868
I'm so lucky.[screaming]

10:06.440 --> 10:08.143
That was incredibly violent.

10:08.176 --> 10:13.176
I did not realize
there was so much stuff
inside of trees.

10:14.514 --> 10:17.365
It's comin' for us!

10:19.653 --> 10:22.953
Somebody do something!

10:36.235 --> 10:37.938
Good thinking, old chum,

10:37.971 --> 10:40.908
knowing I would
clog up its gears,
but it wouldn't kill me.

10:40.942 --> 10:42.210
Yeah, that was, uh...

10:42.243 --> 10:43.778
That was definitely
a thing I knew.

10:43.778 --> 10:45.245
What the hell are we
supposed to do now?

10:45.245 --> 10:47.648
Oh, does someone have
a plot-driven question

10:47.682 --> 10:49.416
that needs
a magical answer?

10:49.450 --> 10:52.187
Let me be of service.

10:52.187 --> 10:54.522
I wish I had that magical sound
in the background, that...

10:54.554 --> 10:56.158
[humming]

10:56.192 --> 10:57.783
There it is!

10:57.783 --> 11:00.061
Can we stop with the Frank show
and get on with it?

11:00.094 --> 11:02.866
Hmm. Ivy's brain is warped
by Scarecrow's fear toxin,

11:02.899 --> 11:05.899
which has activated
all her biggest fears.

11:05.932 --> 11:09.168
To save her, you need
to destroy the thing

11:09.202 --> 11:10.238
she fears most.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.938
And how do we
figure out what that is?

11:11.972 --> 11:14.741
Well, I guess it's not
this monster wood chipper.

11:14.774 --> 11:16.311
What the hell else could it be?

11:16.344 --> 11:19.346
Do you not see the creepy ass
mansion right there, huh?

11:19.379 --> 11:21.816
111 Creepy Ass Street.

11:21.849 --> 11:24.849
[mimics eerie noise]

11:32.726 --> 11:35.596
[sobbing]

11:35.629 --> 11:37.565
Aw, little Ivy.

11:37.597 --> 11:41.001
Pamela, where are
all your friends?

11:41.034 --> 11:43.171
You were right, dear,
she has no friends.

11:43.203 --> 11:46.139
I thought you had at least one
friend, but Mother knew better.

11:46.173 --> 11:48.808
We should've
hired those dwarfs
to pretend to be kids

11:48.842 --> 11:50.311
to pretend to like you.

11:50.345 --> 11:53.581
Of course Ivy's biggest fear
is her cruel father.

11:53.614 --> 11:55.649
Oh, we've all
got daddy issues.

11:55.683 --> 11:59.285
Hey, we're gonna kick
your trust-fund-having ass
s back to boarding school.

11:59.318 --> 12:03.356
[laughing]

12:03.389 --> 12:07.595
[evil laughter]

12:07.628 --> 12:09.263
Help me!

12:09.296 --> 12:10.597
Help me!

12:10.630 --> 12:13.232
Hang on, little Ive,
I'm comin' for ya!

12:13.267 --> 12:16.269
You let me die!

12:16.302 --> 12:20.106
[grunting]

12:20.139 --> 12:21.789
[screaming]

12:26.178 --> 12:31.152
[both screaming]

12:31.152 --> 12:32.922
Okay, we gotta figure a way
back into that mansion

12:32.922 --> 12:35.623
to kill that son of a bitch.

12:35.655 --> 12:38.558
Ivy's dad is not
her biggest fear.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.629
Her biggest fear is on the way.

12:41.662 --> 12:44.565
[maniacal laughter]

12:44.597 --> 12:48.402
All scary shit
got that laugh.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.437
My God! Kite Man?

12:50.471 --> 12:52.306
She's afraid of Kite Man?

12:52.339 --> 12:53.606
No, dummy!

12:53.606 --> 12:55.076
Would you can it
with the commentary

12:55.109 --> 12:56.610
and just let
this shit play out?

12:56.644 --> 12:58.544
He's coming!
I tried to stop him,

12:58.578 --> 13:00.648
but he's too powerful.

13:00.681 --> 13:02.215
I gotta fly.

13:02.249 --> 13:03.417
Fly away.

13:03.450 --> 13:07.386
[screaming]

13:07.421 --> 13:10.191
Help. Nah.

13:10.224 --> 13:12.025
Everybody feel that pucker
in your assholes?

13:12.058 --> 13:15.315
That means shit
is about to get real.

13:17.999 --> 13:19.799
Oh, well, that makes sense.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.235
I mean, it's a little
<i>Christmas Carol,</i>

13:21.235 --> 13:23.770
but, eh, let's just kill 'em.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.604
[all shriek]

13:31.711 --> 13:33.081
We're good, we're fine.

13:33.114 --> 13:36.683
Doing great. A-okay.
Super-duper.

13:36.716 --> 13:37.918
Hunky dory.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.086
[alarm blaring]

13:39.120 --> 13:43.470
Hey, what's
going on in here?

13:46.994 --> 13:48.730
Hey! Watch the hair, shitbag.

13:48.764 --> 13:51.331
I can't pull off
a <i>Felicity</i> season two.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.200
No one can.

13:52.200 --> 13:56.803
Not even <i>Felicity</i> itself.

13:56.836 --> 14:00.573
[yells]

14:00.607 --> 14:01.775
Okay, he's burning rocks.

14:01.808 --> 14:03.510
I'm out.

14:03.544 --> 14:06.447
Clayface, I appear
to have misplaced my bat.

14:06.480 --> 14:07.981
Batter up!

14:08.014 --> 14:09.682
[King Shark laughing]

14:09.716 --> 14:10.750
Oh, that's clever.

14:10.784 --> 14:14.235
It was good, wasn't it?

14:22.429 --> 14:26.366
Harley, you
slash-mostly-Clayface did it!

14:26.400 --> 14:30.504
Now, to find out
how gross your face is.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.606
-[gasps]
-Oh, shit!

14:32.640 --> 14:35.509
Dear God. We're <i>Empire</i>
<i>Strikes Back-ing</i> it.

14:35.509 --> 14:36.509
You're her biggest fear?

14:36.543 --> 14:37.913
I did not see that coming.

14:37.946 --> 14:40.413
That's some M. Night
Shyamalama shit.

14:40.447 --> 14:42.397
What the fu--

14:47.788 --> 14:49.490
Oh, Lordy.

14:49.523 --> 14:50.991
What happened here?

14:51.024 --> 14:53.226
Pretty great, right?

14:53.260 --> 14:55.629
Why would these guards
commit suicide?

14:55.663 --> 14:58.231
Suicide? I killed them!

14:58.265 --> 15:01.235
Protecting your cute bodies.
You're welcome.

15:01.269 --> 15:03.437
Why was I her greatest fear?

15:03.470 --> 15:04.538
[Poison Ivy coughing]

15:04.571 --> 15:05.571
Ivy!

15:11.812 --> 15:13.147
Ivy!

15:13.181 --> 15:14.381
Though I have
so many questions,

15:14.381 --> 15:15.716
they're about to
destroy Gotham,

15:15.749 --> 15:17.717
so we've gotta
get out of here.

15:17.717 --> 15:18.717
Who the fuck
braided my hair?

15:18.719 --> 15:19.821
Mmm. I was bored.

15:19.855 --> 15:21.788
Oh, Jesus.

15:21.822 --> 15:23.990
Ive, why am I
your biggest fear?

15:23.990 --> 15:25.493
Harley, I can't talk
about this right now.

15:25.493 --> 15:26.927
Is it because
when we go out to eat

15:26.961 --> 15:28.363
I always ask
to get a dessert menu

15:28.363 --> 15:30.130
and that makes the dinner
last five minutes longer?

15:30.163 --> 15:31.331
No, but I do hate that

15:31.365 --> 15:33.234
because you never
order anything.

15:33.234 --> 15:34.568
It's 'cause I
always forget that
we have cookies at home.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.336
Listen, Ive, I can't live
with not knowing

15:36.336 --> 15:37.639
why I'm some bad guy
in your brain

15:37.639 --> 15:38.639
settin' fire to things.

15:38.639 --> 15:39.605
I love you.

15:39.605 --> 15:40.841
Harley, later.

15:40.841 --> 15:42.176
Scarecrow's about to
use my pheromones

15:42.176 --> 15:43.677
for some kind of
biological warfare.

15:43.711 --> 15:44.778
We have to stop him.

15:44.812 --> 15:47.881
I think we gotta stop them.

15:47.914 --> 15:50.083
Legion of Doom.
Those pricks!

15:50.116 --> 15:53.488
Yes! But it is nice
to see they're recycling.

15:53.520 --> 15:56.756
Vroom, vroom, boys.
Gotham awaits.

15:56.789 --> 15:59.639
[Scarecrow cackles]

16:04.298 --> 16:07.033
-Shit.
-[Sy] All right, that's
my fault. That's on me.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.903
I parked in the handicap spot.

16:08.936 --> 16:11.272
I know, I know
I could get the pass,

16:11.304 --> 16:12.974
but I'm off the grid here.

16:13.008 --> 16:15.808
I'm not putting my name on some
fakakta government hit list.

16:15.842 --> 16:17.043
Not a car in sight.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.979
You sure about that?

16:19.013 --> 16:22.315
It's time, Sy.
You can do this.

16:22.349 --> 16:24.985
[screams]

16:25.019 --> 16:28.788
In 1984, a toy company
came out with a new line.

16:28.822 --> 16:31.725
[screams]

16:31.759 --> 16:33.159
It was a huge success,

16:33.193 --> 16:34.894
and the CIA took notice.

For my last assignment...

16:36.964 --> 16:39.600
-Fuck your mother!
-Ugh!

16:39.633 --> 16:40.934
I underwent a procedure

16:40.967 --> 16:43.171
using an experimental
technology.

16:43.203 --> 16:44.340
It changed me forever.

16:44.373 --> 16:46.322
It made me...

16:49.844 --> 16:51.577
a transchanger.

16:51.611 --> 16:54.162
Quick, get in me.

17:02.623 --> 17:05.923
Over there,
I see 'em!

Harley, I don't think
I've ever ridden
on Harley Quinn Highway.

17:26.946 --> 17:28.316
Yeah, they let me
design it myself

17:28.316 --> 17:30.000
when I threatened
to nuke the city.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.599

some of my creative choices
right about now.

Let her rip, boys.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.675

18:02.250 --> 18:03.951
I think the trucks
are bulletproof.

18:03.983 --> 18:08.983
Just get me close,
and I'll handle this.

18:09.690 --> 18:11.640

Hey, now that
it's just me and you,

18:25.707 --> 18:27.875
I was hopin' we could talk
a little bit about

18:27.909 --> 18:30.778
why one bestie would think
of the other bestie
as her worst nightmare.

18:30.810 --> 18:33.661
-Not now!
-[grunts]

18:38.952 --> 18:40.320
Uh, what about now?

18:40.320 --> 18:42.222
Fine! You want to know
what my biggest fear is?

18:42.256 --> 18:44.924
Finally allowing myself
to count on someone

18:44.959 --> 18:48.061
and then
having them ditch me.

18:48.095 --> 18:50.266
But I was still plannin'
on helping you.

18:50.299 --> 18:52.299
You were my one friend,

18:52.333 --> 18:54.367
and I asked you
for one favor,

18:54.402 --> 18:55.636
but instead
you ditched me

18:55.670 --> 18:57.471
for the Joker,
who treats ya like shit.

18:57.505 --> 19:00.040
I thought you could change,
but I was wrong.

19:00.075 --> 19:05.075
You still live your entire life
based on what he might think.

19:05.112 --> 19:06.546
So, how do we fix this?

on my friends and on you.
