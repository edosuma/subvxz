00:01.262 --> 00:02.567
- Previously on "The Flash"...

00:02.611 --> 00:04.091
- The disappearance
of Sue Dearbon.

00:04.134 --> 00:06.267
- I don't think I've ever seen
you this devoted to a case.

00:06.919 --> 00:09.052
- I want to become a defense
attorney for meta-humans.

00:10.575 --> 00:13.187
- Meet Chester P. Runk.

00:13.230 --> 00:15.102
- He opened a black hole
by accident.

00:15.145 --> 00:17.495
- What up, party people?

00:17.539 --> 00:18.757
Also where am I?

00:18.801 --> 00:20.150
- His molecules need
to re-stabilize

00:20.194 --> 00:21.499
at the subatomic level.

00:21.543 --> 00:23.284
- And when he does get out,

00:23.327 --> 00:24.850
that boy knows exactly
what he wants to do.

00:24.894 --> 00:26.243
- Gonna ask Natalie out?

00:26.287 --> 00:27.940
- But you cannot avoid
the coming crisis.

00:27.984 --> 00:31.509
- Tell me what I can do.
- The Flash must die.

00:31.553 --> 00:33.163
- Nash, if you could
just tell us

00:33.207 --> 00:35.078
what you're looking
for down there,

00:35.122 --> 00:36.819
we might be able to help you.

00:36.862 --> 00:39.082
- So this is where
you've been hiding.

00:39.126 --> 00:40.910
I know how to save Barry Allen.

00:46.959 --> 00:48.570
This is what I do.

00:48.613 --> 00:52.443
I don't just solve mysteries,
I bust myths.

00:53.879 --> 00:55.446
I bust them wide open.

00:55.490 --> 00:57.274
- You said you could
save Barry.

00:57.318 --> 00:59.233
Tell us what you meant.
The truth.

00:59.276 --> 01:01.104
- Do you know what
you're dealing with?

01:01.148 --> 01:04.673
The Monitor, Mar Novu,
or whatever we calls himself.

01:04.716 --> 01:06.153
- Are you saying
the Monitor's here?

01:06.196 --> 01:07.415
- That's right.

01:07.458 --> 01:09.112
- You tracked a Multiverse god
down to a hole?

01:09.156 --> 01:10.548
- And he's going to do here

01:10.592 --> 01:12.724
what he has done on
all these other Earths--

01:12.768 --> 01:17.642
create fear because
the Monitor is a fraud.

01:17.686 --> 01:19.296
He's a false god.

01:19.340 --> 01:23.257
One that I intend to take down,
thereby saving your husband.

01:23.300 --> 01:25.085
If my calculations are correct,

01:25.128 --> 01:29.524
behind these rocks there's
an inter-dimensional portal,

01:29.567 --> 01:35.007
and that portal will lead us
directly to Mar Novu.

01:35.051 --> 01:37.227
- He's been here all along.

01:37.271 --> 01:38.968
- He has nowhere to run.

01:39.011 --> 01:40.361
Back up.

01:40.404 --> 01:42.276
- Yeah, uh, no.
I wouldn't do it...

01:48.934 --> 01:50.284
- Barry!

01:50.327 --> 01:51.502
- Barry.

01:51.546 --> 01:52.808
- Did you know
that would happen?

01:52.851 --> 01:54.331
- Yeah.

01:54.375 --> 01:56.159
Look, this is just another one
of Mar Novu's tricks.

01:56.203 --> 01:59.249
These rocks are infused
with Eternium, and that creates

01:59.293 --> 02:01.382
an anti-vibrational
force field that--

02:01.425 --> 02:03.166
- No phasing.
- No phasing ,correct.

02:03.210 --> 02:04.515
- So how do we get through?

02:04.559 --> 02:06.343
- I've got a jackhammer
in my car, so...

02:06.387 --> 02:07.779
- Uh, no.

02:07.823 --> 02:09.738
Any contact with the Eternium
in this sediment

02:09.781 --> 02:11.827
could cause a catastrophic
molecular blast.

02:11.870 --> 02:13.263
Everybody dies.

02:13.307 --> 02:15.613
No instead,
all I need is an artifact.

02:15.657 --> 02:18.747
One that will illuminate
the Eternium

02:18.790 --> 02:21.532
so I can know what rocks
to dig around.

02:21.576 --> 02:25.319
Simple, and I'd know
where to find that artifact.

02:56.959 --> 02:59.483
What up, party people?

03:03.748 --> 03:07.622
Uh, hello?

03:09.972 --> 03:12.235
Where is everybody?

03:13.367 --> 03:16.544
Chester P.
Chester P., my brother.

03:16.587 --> 03:23.377
You have a multi-billion dollar
bleeding edge tech facility

03:23.420 --> 03:25.640
all to yourself.

03:28.295 --> 03:30.079
- ♪ Only thing I gotta say
- Whoo!

03:30.122 --> 03:31.689
♪ It's the vibration,
the good sensation ♪

03:31.733 --> 03:33.909

A sonic wrench?

03:38.827 --> 03:40.350
Good morning, guv'nor!

03:40.394 --> 03:41.786
I'm the Doctor!

03:41.830 --> 03:43.440
Phew!

03:43.484 --> 03:46.095
They have a multi-rigged
private global

03:46.138 --> 03:48.053
satellite surveillance system?

03:48.097 --> 03:49.272
Ah!

03:49.316 --> 03:50.317
Time to check my emails.

03:52.710 --> 03:53.798
Disabled?

03:53.842 --> 03:55.452
I'm going again.
I'm going again.

04:00.152 --> 04:02.285
Uh-oh.

04:02.329 --> 04:04.853
- Uh-oh.

04:04.896 --> 04:07.290
- Killer Frost.
Wow.

04:07.334 --> 04:09.423
- The one day I get watch duty.

04:09.466 --> 04:12.295
- Uh, what does this mean?

04:12.339 --> 04:14.210
- Looks like technically
you're dead.

04:22.305 --> 04:24.264
- Oh!
Can I touch it?

04:24.307 --> 04:25.656
- Mm-hmm.

04:25.700 --> 04:27.789
- The official Elongated Man
emblem.

04:27.832 --> 04:30.531
He's gonna scream.
He's gonna be so surprised.

04:30.574 --> 04:32.097
- I've been preparing
the whole team

04:32.141 --> 04:33.708
for life after Crisis,

04:33.751 --> 04:35.318
but Central City
also has to be ready

04:35.362 --> 04:36.798
for a world without Flash,

04:36.841 --> 04:39.366
and Elongated Man should be
its sole protector

04:39.409 --> 04:40.758
once I'm gone.

04:40.802 --> 04:42.543
As far as Ralph knows,
he's coming to CCPD

04:42.586 --> 04:43.979
for a routine deposition
tomorrow,

04:44.022 --> 04:47.504
when it's really a press
conference to pass the torch.

04:48.940 --> 04:51.465
- Hey guys.

04:51.508 --> 04:52.466
- Yo!

04:52.509 --> 04:53.858
- Got your message, Joe.

04:53.902 --> 04:55.512
- Hey Ralph, I talked
to an old friend

04:55.556 --> 04:57.340
about your Dearbon case.

04:57.384 --> 04:59.386
I got the address you were
looking for in Midway City.

04:59.429 --> 05:01.126
If I were you,
I would go check it out

05:01.170 --> 05:02.606
after the deposition tomorrow.

05:02.650 --> 05:04.434
- Why put off tomorrow what
you can do it today, right?

05:04.478 --> 05:05.914
Thanks.
- Wait, wait, wait.

05:05.957 --> 05:07.655
Um, you're gonna be back
from Midway

05:07.698 --> 05:09.134
by tomorrow morning, right?

05:09.178 --> 05:11.006
- It's a routine deposition.
You can handle it.

05:11.049 --> 05:12.703
- Why don't I tag along?

05:12.747 --> 05:13.965
I'll speed things up a bit.

05:14.009 --> 05:15.576
- You wanna help me
with a PI case?

05:15.619 --> 05:16.577
- Yeah, definitely.
It'll be fun.

05:16.620 --> 05:18.230
I'll follow your lead.

05:18.274 --> 05:19.362
- Okay.

05:30.460 --> 05:32.897
- This looks like
it's gonna take awhile.

05:32.941 --> 05:34.856
- Not if you know how
to work the system.

05:34.899 --> 05:36.510
I spent the whole summer
hobnobbing

05:36.553 --> 05:38.903
with the rich, famous,
and the infamous.

05:38.947 --> 05:41.253
Relax, I got this.

05:41.297 --> 05:44.213
- Yeah, I can't imagine
spending a whole summer

05:44.256 --> 05:46.346
undercover with this crowd.

05:46.389 --> 05:47.564
What does a gala event

05:47.608 --> 05:49.566
have to do with Sue's
disappearance anyway?

05:49.610 --> 05:51.133
- Right before Sue vanished,
she was seen wearing

05:51.176 --> 05:54.615
a one-of-a-kind
Victoria Veil dress in Milan.

05:54.658 --> 05:58.140
This photo was taken
three weeks ago.

05:58.183 --> 06:00.011
It's the exact same dress.

06:00.055 --> 06:01.143
Sue was here.

06:01.186 --> 06:02.666
And either she's still here

06:02.710 --> 06:06.409
or somebody in there
knows why she isn't.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.063
Time to suit up.

06:22.164 --> 06:23.600
Lose the ring, pal.

06:23.644 --> 06:26.211
This is how
we suit up tonight.

06:38.963 --> 06:41.662
- So if anyone here knows
where Sue is,

06:41.705 --> 06:43.098
it'll be the party's host.

06:43.141 --> 06:44.665
- There's hundreds of people
in here.

06:44.708 --> 06:46.623
How do we narrow it down?

06:46.667 --> 06:49.583
- Golden tile, sir.
Thank you.

06:49.626 --> 06:50.540
- The VIP lounge.

06:50.584 --> 06:51.889
That's where anyone
who's anyone

06:51.933 --> 06:54.239
will be going to kiss
the proverbial ring.

06:54.283 --> 06:56.459
We need to get in there.

06:56.503 --> 06:58.418
- Here, mine was tight too.
Just let me...

06:59.897 --> 07:03.553
- Now I have ten selfies
of inside Barry Allen's nose.

07:03.597 --> 07:05.294
- A camera tie?

07:05.337 --> 07:08.906
What, you have a knife shoe
and a grapple-hook belt too?

07:08.950 --> 07:10.908
- Maybe.

07:10.952 --> 07:13.084
- ♪ You like it better
with my lips... ♪

07:13.128 --> 07:16.218

07:34.584 --> 07:37.152
I haven't seen you at one
of these events before.

07:37.195 --> 07:38.501
- That's because I spent
the last year

07:38.545 --> 07:40.024
on my island in Dubai.

07:40.068 --> 07:42.026
My partner and I sold
our corporation.

07:43.941 --> 07:45.508
- Barry?

07:49.730 --> 07:52.646
- GinGold martini.
Shaken, not stirred.

07:52.689 --> 07:55.779
- Congratulations on selling
your corporation, Barry.

07:55.823 --> 07:58.042
I do hope you reinvested
your profits

07:58.086 --> 07:59.870
in collateralized
loan obligations.

07:59.914 --> 08:02.917
- Yes, we recently sold
our company

08:02.960 --> 08:05.615
for many millions of dollars.

08:07.704 --> 08:09.793
Do you know our host?

08:09.837 --> 08:13.318
- Mr. Meyers?
- Yes, Mr. Meyers.

08:15.103 --> 08:17.975
The host of this event
is Remington Meister.

08:18.019 --> 08:20.064
You both crashed this event,
didn't you?

08:22.502 --> 08:24.591
Would you like
some free advice?

08:24.634 --> 08:28.333
I'd leave before someone scary
comes and finds you.

08:32.947 --> 08:34.992
- Well, that did not go well.

08:35.036 --> 08:36.951
- Yes, it did.

08:38.387 --> 08:41.085
Our VIP ticket.

08:41.129 --> 08:43.348
Finesse.

08:54.795 --> 08:57.624
- Harrison Wells?
- Ah!

08:57.667 --> 08:59.147
Okay, who are you?

08:59.190 --> 09:01.584
- Allegra.
- You're the intern.

09:01.628 --> 09:03.717
So maybe you can help me
with something.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.588
Uh, I'm looking
for a UV emitter,

09:05.632 --> 09:06.676
and my scanner tells me

09:06.720 --> 09:11.681
there is a UV emitter
right around here.

09:11.725 --> 09:12.900
- You're supposed to be dead.

09:12.943 --> 09:15.163
What happened?
Did you fake your own death?

09:15.206 --> 09:16.425
- What?
Oh, no.

09:16.468 --> 09:19.341
So you, uh, no.
You think I'm Harrison Wells.

09:19.384 --> 09:20.603
I'm not Harrison Wells.

09:20.647 --> 09:23.780
My name is Nash.
Nash Wells.

09:24.825 --> 09:26.696
- You look just like him.

09:26.740 --> 09:28.785
- Yeah, well,
doppelgangers are like that.

09:39.753 --> 09:41.798
Oh...

09:42.407 --> 09:43.844
Stupid Earth.

09:44.714 --> 09:46.673
Okay, Accelerant.
- Allegra.

09:46.716 --> 09:49.023
- I'm doing a dig, all right?

09:49.066 --> 09:51.591
I need UV rays
to complete my dig.

09:51.634 --> 09:54.855
You, according to my
gauntlet...

09:54.898 --> 09:56.596
Are a meta-human
with UV capabilities.

09:56.639 --> 09:57.771
You see where I'm going here?

09:57.814 --> 10:00.208
- You want me to use
my powers to help you?

10:00.251 --> 10:01.818
- Yes!
- I can't help you.

10:01.862 --> 10:03.167
- What?
Why not?

10:03.211 --> 10:05.082
- Never mind.
The answer is no.

10:05.126 --> 10:07.824
- Allegra,
I will make you a deal.

10:07.868 --> 10:10.653
You help me with the--

10:10.697 --> 10:12.176
UV thing,

10:12.220 --> 10:17.747
and I will give you
the scoop of the century.

10:17.791 --> 10:22.752
Doppelgangers, Multiverse,
and potentially

10:22.796 --> 10:26.930
the end of all life
as we know it.

10:27.801 --> 10:30.151
Now how does that sound to you?

10:31.935 --> 10:34.372
- Tell me more about
this Multiverse.

10:35.809 --> 10:37.680
- The bank unfroze
your accounts,

10:37.724 --> 10:40.291
and maybe I erased
your parking tickets

10:40.335 --> 10:42.772
when I got your
driver's license reinstated.

10:42.816 --> 10:44.295
- Thanks, Cecile!

10:44.339 --> 10:46.689
Oh, your clients
are lucky to have you.

10:46.733 --> 10:48.473
Hey, speaking of,

10:48.517 --> 10:51.694
I should let you get back
to doing your job.

10:51.738 --> 10:52.956
Thank you so much

10:53.000 --> 10:54.392
for everything
that you've done.

10:54.436 --> 10:56.656
- Wait, you know what?
Hey, Chester.

10:56.699 --> 10:58.135
I got--I got a little time.

10:58.179 --> 10:59.746
Is there--is there
anything else

10:59.789 --> 11:01.878
that you could use
some help with.

11:01.922 --> 11:03.837
- Hmm, nope.
All is good in Chester-hood.

11:03.880 --> 11:04.838
- Wait!

11:04.881 --> 11:06.274
Don't go!
Don't go!

11:06.317 --> 11:08.755
Are you sure?
Like are you sure-sure?

11:08.798 --> 11:11.409
Anything at all that
I could help you with?

11:11.453 --> 11:12.759
I mean, think hard.

11:12.802 --> 11:14.586
There is something.

11:14.630 --> 11:16.806
I knew it!
Okay, sock it to me.

11:16.850 --> 11:18.808
- Jitters is gone, right?

11:18.852 --> 11:21.942
Which means that
I'll never see Na...

11:21.985 --> 11:25.075
their coffee again.

11:25.119 --> 11:29.471
- Yeah, I'm thinking that
by coffee, you mean Natalie?

11:29.514 --> 11:30.777
- I was gonna ask her out

11:30.820 --> 11:32.779
after I filled out
my Vibe-acino punch card.

11:32.822 --> 11:36.478
But it's too late now, so...

11:37.914 --> 11:41.744
Sorry, I--I know this isn't
a lawyer problem at all.

11:41.788 --> 11:42.745
- No, it's not,

11:42.789 --> 11:47.402
but it is
a meta-empath problem.

11:53.669 --> 11:55.410
You got--you got powers?

11:55.453 --> 11:56.498
- Oh, I have powers.

11:56.541 --> 11:58.456
- Oh, that's so cool!

11:58.500 --> 12:00.415
That's so cool!

12:00.458 --> 12:02.504
That must've been
a major conflict of interest

12:02.547 --> 12:03.766
as a DA though.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.333
- It was.
Yeah.

12:05.376 --> 12:09.772
Uh, but those powers are about
to help you ask out Natalie.

12:09.816 --> 12:10.817
- Yeah!
- Let's do it.

12:10.860 --> 12:11.992
- Yeah!
- Okay, we're doing it.

12:23.960 --> 12:26.789
- Very few of my guests
have the tapferkeit

12:26.833 --> 12:28.443
to challenge me like this.

12:28.486 --> 12:33.578
After all,
I'm the master of this ring.

12:35.798 --> 12:37.495
Strict rules of Mahjong?

12:37.539 --> 12:39.062
- But of course.

12:39.106 --> 12:41.848
- Oh, so gentlemen,

12:41.891 --> 12:45.199
I don't think we
have been introduced.

12:45.242 --> 12:47.375
I'm Remington Meister,
your host.

12:47.418 --> 12:50.204
And you are?

12:50.247 --> 12:52.946
- The name's Dibny.
Ralph Dibny.

12:54.686 --> 12:56.079
- Allen.
Barry--

12:56.123 --> 13:00.170
- Well, nice to meet you,
Allen Barry and Ralph Dibny.

13:00.214 --> 13:04.609
Hmm, and what brings you to
my wonderful grosse feier?

13:08.788 --> 13:10.572
- Sue Dearbon.

13:13.531 --> 13:15.838
- Sue?

13:15.882 --> 13:20.800
A, uh, fiercely intelligent
young woman.

13:22.105 --> 13:23.890
She's a friend of yours?
- Um...

13:23.933 --> 13:26.980
- I'm an admirer of hers.

13:27.023 --> 13:31.985
- Ah, you have taste,
Mr. Dibny.

13:33.290 --> 13:35.510
- And I wish I could be
a more auspicious host

13:35.553 --> 13:36.816
and introduce you,

13:36.859 --> 13:39.253
but I'm afraid
Ms. Dearbon isn't here.

13:39.296 --> 13:42.778
In fact, I don't think I've
seen her at any social event

13:42.822 --> 13:44.475
in over six months.

13:44.519 --> 13:48.001
Perhaps she'll attend an event
in your facility soon.

13:48.044 --> 13:50.568
And, uh, where was that?
What?

13:50.612 --> 13:52.266
- Paris.
- Dubai.

13:53.571 --> 13:56.270
We run a multi-city
import/export company.

13:56.313 --> 13:57.967
- Hmm!

13:58.011 --> 14:00.578
- Maybe she's still
on the guest list.

14:00.622 --> 14:02.929
You know, just in case.

14:02.972 --> 14:04.974
- You think I should check?

14:07.020 --> 14:08.717
- Sure, yeah.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.675
- Idna!

14:14.679 --> 14:17.073
- That's a beautiful dress.

14:17.117 --> 14:18.901
Is this one-of-a-kind?

14:18.945 --> 14:20.468
- Two-of-a-kind, actually.

14:20.511 --> 14:22.992
Even the most stubborn
designer's one-of-a-kind outfit

14:23.036 --> 14:24.080
has a price.

14:24.124 --> 14:25.865
So true!

14:25.908 --> 14:27.257
So true!

14:27.301 --> 14:28.911
I'm impressed.

14:28.955 --> 14:31.044
You have quite the eye
for fashion.

14:31.087 --> 14:32.349
- Oh.

14:32.393 --> 14:35.091
- Sue Dearbon
is not on the list.

14:35.135 --> 14:36.440
- Oh.

14:36.484 --> 14:39.008
- And strange...

14:39.052 --> 14:40.357
neither are you.

14:40.401 --> 14:42.751
- Well, when an auction
like yours pops up,

14:42.794 --> 14:44.927
no list can keep us away.

14:47.974 --> 14:49.889
- I like you.

14:51.586 --> 14:54.632
Him? Nicht so viel.

14:57.853 --> 14:59.115
Oh!

15:00.943 --> 15:02.249
Mahjong.

15:02.292 --> 15:04.991
Sieg.
I win.

15:05.034 --> 15:07.123
Such a pleasure
to meet you both.

15:07.167 --> 15:09.082
Enjoy the rest of your evening.

15:11.258 --> 15:13.956
- I'm sorry, man.
I thought I had that.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.089
I--we should get back
to Central City.

15:16.132 --> 15:19.048
- Put our friend above
on high alert.

15:39.112 --> 15:40.504
- I tracked down the woman

15:40.548 --> 15:42.028
who designed Sue's dress
in the Milan.

15:42.071 --> 15:43.551
- Yeah.
- It turns out that Idna

15:43.594 --> 15:45.118
did commission her
to make another one.

15:45.161 --> 15:47.120
So I think what we gotta
do next is probably--

15:47.163 --> 15:48.425
- Ralph, Sue's not here.

15:48.469 --> 15:50.079
We just got made
and we just hit a dead end.

15:50.123 --> 15:51.472
We should head back
to Central City.

15:51.515 --> 15:52.995
- Barry, if Meister
wanted us out of here,

15:53.039 --> 15:53.996
we'd be gone already.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.258
Take a whiff, would ya?

15:55.302 --> 15:56.868
Something doesn't smell
right here.

15:56.912 --> 15:59.219
- Ralph, I know you care about
this Sue case,

15:59.262 --> 16:01.047
but we're grasping at straws.

16:01.090 --> 16:03.136
I'm not even sure
there's a mystery here.

16:03.179 --> 16:05.573
- Really?
You're not sure?

16:05.616 --> 16:07.705
You see that guy with
the eye patch right there?

16:07.749 --> 16:09.316
That's Riggs Wellington.

16:09.359 --> 16:11.927
he's a shady
Bratva counterfeiter.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.146
And January Galore?

16:13.189 --> 16:15.148
She's an underground
weapons dealer.

16:15.191 --> 16:17.150
That guy right there,
he's a drug kingpin.

16:17.193 --> 16:19.500
The woman he's talking to
is a mob boss.

16:19.543 --> 16:22.024
- If this is a party
for criminals,

16:22.068 --> 16:23.025
then the Flash
and Elongated Man

16:23.069 --> 16:24.374
need to take over.

16:24.418 --> 16:25.854
- Pump the brakes, would ya?

16:25.897 --> 16:28.117
There's a time and a place
for masks and cowls,

16:28.161 --> 16:29.989
but this is not it.

16:30.032 --> 16:32.034
This Meister,
he's up to something.

16:32.078 --> 16:34.428
We need to find out what it is,
no matter how long it takes.

16:35.777 --> 16:38.040
- Ralph, tomorrow we have--
we have the deposition--

16:38.084 --> 16:40.216
- Lay off the whole deposition
thing, would ya?

16:40.260 --> 16:41.565
CCPD can wait.

16:41.609 --> 16:43.437
- I can search this
whole place in seconds.

16:43.480 --> 16:45.047
- Barry, I realize
that you want to help

16:45.091 --> 16:47.310
and I appreciate that,
but this is not Central City,

16:47.354 --> 16:50.052
these people are not metas.

16:50.096 --> 16:52.881
This is a time
for our human identities.

16:52.924 --> 16:55.449
Finesse, remember?

16:55.492 --> 16:58.017
I just need some time, okay?
- Okay.

17:12.118 --> 17:14.076
- Here's the deal.

17:14.120 --> 17:16.209
I made a coffee order with
the new Jitters-To-Go service.

17:16.252 --> 17:17.297
That's where Natalie
works now.

17:17.340 --> 17:19.125
So when she arrives,

17:19.168 --> 17:21.779
I am going to read
her emotion,

17:21.823 --> 17:23.346
and then I'm gonna tell you
what to say.

17:23.390 --> 17:26.306
- What if she says no?
- She's not gonna say no!

17:26.349 --> 17:27.785
Not with my help.

17:27.829 --> 17:29.222
- And I'm here too.

17:29.265 --> 17:31.180
My good deed for the day
was to help somebody,

17:31.224 --> 17:33.791
and I couldn't find
anyone less annoying.

17:33.835 --> 17:35.445
- Really?

17:35.489 --> 17:38.187
- Hey, I have a delivery
for Chester P. Runk?

17:38.231 --> 17:39.797
- Yep, that's--that's--
that's, uh, that's me.

17:39.841 --> 17:41.103
Yeah.

17:41.147 --> 17:43.323
- Wow.
12 Vibe-acinos.

17:43.366 --> 17:44.498
- Yeah.

17:44.541 --> 17:46.108
- Chester,
she's feeling impressed.

17:46.152 --> 17:47.544
A big order like that,

17:47.588 --> 17:49.242
it shows her that you are
a man with means.

17:49.285 --> 17:52.245
- Yeah, well, you know,
I'm a--

17:52.288 --> 17:54.160
kind of a big spender,
you know?

17:54.203 --> 17:55.900
Can't take it with you, right?

17:55.944 --> 17:57.206
- Sure.
I guess.

17:57.250 --> 17:58.599
Do you need a receipt?

17:58.642 --> 18:00.253
- Are you sure
you're reading her right?

18:00.296 --> 18:01.645
- Yeah!
Of course.

18:01.689 --> 18:06.824
Um, um, hey Chester,
she's yearning for validation.

18:06.868 --> 18:08.957
So pay her a compliment.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.263
She's feeling very strong,

18:10.306 --> 18:12.830
positive feelings
about her shoes.

18:12.874 --> 18:14.223
- Uh, I--man.

18:14.267 --> 18:16.269
I really like your shoes.

18:18.271 --> 18:20.142
- These old things?
Yuck.

18:20.186 --> 18:22.013
I lost my favorite kicks
to a black hole.

18:22.057 --> 18:24.364
- That's, uh, that's rough.

18:24.407 --> 18:25.713
- You are totally
missing the mark.

18:25.756 --> 18:28.019
You're not helping!

18:28.063 --> 18:29.804
Uh, Chester, be assertive.

18:29.847 --> 18:31.327
Don't let her leave
without asking her out.

18:31.371 --> 18:33.068
Uh, Natalie.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.243
Uh, before you go,

18:34.287 --> 18:38.160
I was wondering if--
if we could, you know,

18:38.204 --> 18:40.423
I--I could carry
this crate for you.

18:40.467 --> 18:42.643
- Oh, it's not a problem.
- Yes, it is.

18:42.686 --> 18:44.862
She wants you
to be chivalrous.

18:44.906 --> 18:46.037
Help her now!

18:46.081 --> 18:47.387
- Girl, I got it.

18:55.873 --> 18:57.440
- Pardon moi?

18:57.484 --> 18:59.181
I could pay for this.

18:59.225 --> 19:01.314
- Yeah,
I think you've done enough.

19:03.359 --> 19:04.795
- I'm no expert,

19:04.839 --> 19:07.015
but the Book of Ralph says
that when you ask someone out,

19:07.058 --> 19:08.321
you should just be yourself.

19:08.364 --> 19:10.975
- How is he supposed
to be himself

19:11.019 --> 19:13.848
when he doesn't even know
who he is anymore?

19:21.464 --> 19:23.727
- And these different Earths

19:23.771 --> 19:26.426
have existed
simultaneously since...

19:26.469 --> 19:28.602
- Well, since, uh--let's see.
Oh, the dawn of time.

19:28.645 --> 19:30.212
- Well, how come nobody
knows about this?

19:30.256 --> 19:31.387
I mean, stuff this big?

19:31.431 --> 19:32.823
The public should
be made aware.

19:32.867 --> 19:34.347
- People know.
Just the right people.

19:34.390 --> 19:36.305
The general public?
No, no.

19:36.349 --> 19:38.655
No, that would not be good.
They would lose their minds.

19:38.699 --> 19:41.745
- Right, I mean...

19:41.789 --> 19:43.747
it's all so...

19:45.140 --> 19:46.359
Epic.
- Yes, it's epic.

19:46.402 --> 19:48.535
Doppelgangers,
anti-matter events,

19:48.578 --> 19:50.363
and speedsters juggling
dual identities,

19:50.406 --> 19:52.234
like the Flash
and Barry Allen.

19:53.975 --> 19:55.281
- Wait, what?

19:55.324 --> 19:57.239
- What?

19:57.283 --> 19:59.285
- My boss' husband
is the Flash?

19:59.328 --> 20:01.112
- Mm-hmm.

20:01.156 --> 20:03.332
- Ah, nobody tells me anything.
- But then, of course,

20:03.376 --> 20:05.334
let's not forget the villain
of this story--

20:05.378 --> 20:07.336
the Monitor.
Hmm, yeah.

20:07.380 --> 20:10.296
The cosmic imposter
with delusions of grandeur.

20:10.339 --> 20:15.344
That is why I'm gonna take
that fraud down permanently.

20:20.175 --> 20:23.352
- You're gonna kill
this Novu guy?

20:24.310 --> 20:25.789
- Enough story time.

20:25.833 --> 20:28.227
Time for you to hold up
your end of the bargain.

20:28.270 --> 20:30.925
- Wait, can you explain
doppelgangers?

20:30.968 --> 20:33.884
- Sure, absolutely.
I can, but first--

20:33.928 --> 20:36.322
Let's have you zap this
with your meta UV lights,

20:36.365 --> 20:39.281
so I can find out what rocks
to avoid when I excavate.

20:39.325 --> 20:42.676
And go.

20:56.516 --> 20:58.082
- I...

20:58.126 --> 20:59.997
I--I can't.

21:00.041 --> 21:01.303
- Yes, you can.

21:01.347 --> 21:03.305
You're a meta.
It's who you are.

21:03.349 --> 21:04.437
- No, it--it's not.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.482
- It is,
and also we had a deal.

21:06.526 --> 21:08.136
- Well, the deal's off.
- What?

21:08.179 --> 21:10.660
- I'm not gonna be some weapon
you use to hurt others.

21:10.704 --> 21:12.488
- I'm not asking you
to be the weapon.

21:12.532 --> 21:14.577
- It's not who I am.

21:32.639 --> 21:35.424
- All right,
let's see what we got here.

21:39.820 --> 21:42.910
Something tells me that
ain't a Johnny Cash song.

21:48.611 --> 21:51.005
- Damn it, Ralph.
She's not here.

22:08.022 --> 22:10.372
- They're all here
to bid on this.

22:12.548 --> 22:15.159
Come on, come on.

22:29.609 --> 22:31.524
- Meta target acquired.

22:32.481 --> 22:34.440
- Wunderbar.

22:46.626 --> 22:48.454
- Hey, hey.

22:48.497 --> 22:50.281
Don't bother.
It's meta-dampened.

22:50.325 --> 22:54.111
- I must say, I did
not expect Central City's

22:54.155 --> 22:58.507
resident superhero
to crash my little gathering.

22:58.551 --> 22:59.813
- And I must say,

22:59.856 --> 23:01.554
I'm surprised by all
the Bond villain clichés.

23:01.597 --> 23:04.034
I mean, you've got the accent,
the diabolical scheme,

23:04.078 --> 23:06.428
even the silent
but deadly henchperson.

23:06.472 --> 23:07.560
- Ultraviolet?

23:07.603 --> 23:09.083
I sent you to Iron Heights.

23:09.126 --> 23:12.260
- Luckily, she has friends
in low places.

23:12.303 --> 23:13.783
- And let me guess,

23:13.827 --> 23:16.133
you're gonna add my unmasking
to your little auction?

23:16.177 --> 23:21.400
- Oh, I could care less about
your secret identity, Flash.

23:21.443 --> 23:23.663
My interests are global.

23:23.706 --> 23:27.536
And to think, Mr. Dibny,
that it was the Flash

23:27.580 --> 23:29.973
that set off
my meta-activity monitor

23:30.017 --> 23:33.412
that then triggered
the security protocols

23:33.455 --> 23:35.936
that got you caught.

23:35.979 --> 23:37.459
Danke schon.

23:37.503 --> 23:40.462
I am very curious, though,

23:40.506 --> 23:43.639
as to why you are really here.

23:44.684 --> 23:46.337
- Do you expect me to talk?

23:46.381 --> 23:48.601
- No, Mr. Dibny...

23:49.558 --> 23:51.299
I expect you to die.

23:51.342 --> 23:52.779
- Oh, come on.

23:52.822 --> 23:55.695
That line is literally
from "Goldfinger."

23:55.738 --> 23:58.828
- And so is this.

23:58.872 --> 24:03.964
Behold, a state-of-the-art
industrial laser canon.

24:04.007 --> 24:07.533
It will shoot a deadly beam--
zap!--

24:07.576 --> 24:08.621
through the both of you

24:08.664 --> 24:11.754
the moment Central City
is destroyed.

24:12.668 --> 24:14.540
- You're gonna kill millions
of innocent people

24:14.583 --> 24:15.932
just to sell your weapon?

24:15.976 --> 24:17.586
- Yeah.

24:17.630 --> 24:20.459
Enjoy the show.

24:33.776 --> 24:35.517
- Got lost, didn't you?

24:35.561 --> 24:37.432
- What?
No.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.521
- No?
- Maybe.

24:39.565 --> 24:41.828
- Shut up.

24:41.871 --> 24:44.570
- I freaked you out, didn't I?

24:44.613 --> 24:48.225
- Watching Rag Doll eat while
in Iron Heights is freaky.

24:48.269 --> 24:51.141
- Sure it is.
So why the disappearing act?

24:51.185 --> 24:53.927
Actually, let me pause
at theory on that.

24:53.970 --> 24:57.539
I think you're afraid
to use your powers

24:57.583 --> 24:58.584
because if you do,

24:58.627 --> 25:02.152
you think you'll
become like someone.

25:02.196 --> 25:03.763
Someone.

25:03.806 --> 25:06.113
Someone you know,
someone you...

25:07.462 --> 25:09.246
hate.

25:09.290 --> 25:10.987
How am I doing?

25:11.031 --> 25:14.774
- My cousin, Esperanza,
she has the same powers as me,

25:14.817 --> 25:17.254
only she uses them
to murder people.

25:20.910 --> 25:22.782
- You're not your cousin.

25:23.826 --> 25:28.048
But if I start using my powers,

25:28.091 --> 25:30.703
what's to stop me
from becoming like her?

25:30.746 --> 25:33.401
- Because, Allegra,
in this life we choose.

25:33.444 --> 25:35.882
We choose who we are.

25:35.925 --> 25:38.885
So if you choose to use
your incredible powers,

25:38.928 --> 25:42.453
that does not make you
anything like Esperanza

25:42.497 --> 25:44.760
unless you choose that.

25:49.722 --> 25:52.725
I'm not Esperanza.
- Who are you?

25:52.768 --> 25:54.596
- I'm Allegra.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.250
- Yes.

25:57.773 --> 25:59.732
Allegra Garcia.

25:59.775 --> 26:01.821
- Yes.

26:04.650 --> 26:06.565
- Well, that was anti-climatic.

26:37.770 --> 26:39.685
Did I do it?

26:41.295 --> 26:43.732
- Yes.

26:43.776 --> 26:45.821
I think you did.

26:49.956 --> 26:51.740
- Hey.

26:53.786 --> 26:54.961
How you holding up?

26:55.004 --> 26:59.748
- Hmm, like Alderaan
on a bad day.

27:00.967 --> 27:03.970
You look pretty
emotionally vaporized too.

27:05.101 --> 27:09.715
- Okay, Chester, I--I think
that I was using your problems

27:09.758 --> 27:12.326
as a distraction
from my own feelings,

27:12.369 --> 27:16.678
and my internal compass
was completely off,

27:16.722 --> 27:18.027
and that made me sense
the opposite

27:18.071 --> 27:19.812
of what Natalie was feeling.

27:19.855 --> 27:22.510
And I'm so sorry.
I'm so, so sorry.

27:22.553 --> 27:24.730
I've had these powers
for two years now,

27:24.773 --> 27:27.820
and I'm still
figuring them out.

27:28.734 --> 27:29.778
- How you feeling now?

27:29.822 --> 27:32.563
- Oh, uh, honestly,
I don't know.

27:32.607 --> 27:35.131
- Let's pretend I'm the empath.

27:35.175 --> 27:36.829
What kind of feelings
would you be putting off?

27:36.872 --> 27:38.744
No, no.
Stare into my eyes.

27:38.787 --> 27:39.832
- Okay.

27:39.875 --> 27:43.966
- And imagine my pupils
are swirling.

27:44.967 --> 27:47.578
And--and swirling,
and swirling.

27:47.622 --> 27:49.929
- Okay, honey, that's
a hypnotist, not an empath,

27:49.972 --> 27:51.757
but I really appreciate
the effort.

27:51.800 --> 27:52.801
Yeah, uh...
- Yeah, you're right.

27:52.845 --> 27:55.717
- How am I feeling?
I'm...

27:55.761 --> 27:57.937
oh, my God.
I'm freaking out.

27:57.980 --> 27:59.852
You know,
I was a DA for 20 years,

27:59.895 --> 28:02.637
and they just--boom,
replaced me overnight.

28:02.681 --> 28:05.161
And now I feel like I don't
exactly know who I am anymore,

28:05.205 --> 28:07.816
and if I fail at this
meta-attorney thing,

28:07.860 --> 28:10.863
I can't go back.

28:11.820 --> 28:13.604
- Yeah, but you didn't fail me.

28:14.910 --> 28:16.607
- You know,
I think the two of us

28:16.651 --> 28:20.742
just need to trust
that the real us

28:20.786 --> 28:23.397
will always shine through.

28:23.440 --> 28:26.356
Which is why I will embrace
the new me

28:26.400 --> 28:29.969
by finally asking out Natalie.

28:30.012 --> 28:31.753
You know, seize the moment
and all that.

28:31.797 --> 28:33.102
- Yeah.

28:33.146 --> 28:36.584
- And maybe you should too.

28:36.627 --> 28:38.891
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

28:47.813 --> 28:50.293
Maybe I should too.

28:53.166 --> 28:54.820
- I should've listened to you.

28:54.863 --> 28:58.214
If we'd done things your way,
we wouldn't have gotten caught.

28:58.258 --> 28:59.999
Maybe I should be handing
Central City

29:00.042 --> 29:02.566
over to Ralph Dibny
rather than Elongated Man.

29:02.610 --> 29:04.394
- What are you talking about?

29:04.438 --> 29:07.006
- There's no deposition.

29:07.049 --> 29:10.444
I planned a press conference
to present you

29:10.487 --> 29:12.794
as Central City's
official protector.

29:12.838 --> 29:14.187
Because of this coming Crisis,

29:14.230 --> 29:16.624
I have to prepare the city
for a world without Flash.

29:16.667 --> 29:19.061
- Wow.

29:19.105 --> 29:23.196
I'm, uh...I'm honored

29:23.239 --> 29:26.068
that you think that
I could help fill your shoes.

29:26.112 --> 29:29.202
Look, tonight's job
was for Ralph Dibny

29:29.245 --> 29:32.988
because both parts
of my identity have value.

29:33.032 --> 29:35.208
The same is true for you,

29:35.251 --> 29:38.907
only tonight I could've used
your civilian half.

29:38.951 --> 29:43.085
What I'm trying to say
is Barry Allen

29:43.129 --> 29:45.827
is just as important
as the Flash.

29:47.960 --> 29:49.962
Try to remember that.

29:50.005 --> 29:52.834
I know I will.

29:54.880 --> 29:58.971
You know,
can you reach my cufflink?

29:59.014 --> 30:00.973
- What?
- Grab my cufflink.

30:02.888 --> 30:05.804
Yeah.
- Got it.

30:05.847 --> 30:06.892
All right, I got it.

30:06.935 --> 30:08.937
- Okay, on three,

30:08.981 --> 30:10.939
I want you to flick it
at that laser cannon.

30:10.983 --> 30:14.464
One, two, flick!

30:16.902 --> 30:19.078
- All right, I got it.
It's down.

30:19.121 --> 30:21.645
Uh-oh.

30:23.909 --> 30:26.346
Whoa, watch out.
- What was that?

30:27.869 --> 30:29.349
Okay, uh, what do we do?

30:29.392 --> 30:31.003
- I don't know.

30:31.046 --> 30:32.656
- Uh, what do we do?

30:34.136 --> 30:36.051
Ah!
Jeez!

30:36.095 --> 30:37.226
How do we stop that?

30:37.270 --> 30:38.880
- There's a pattern.
- Really?

30:38.924 --> 30:41.143
- All right,
when I say now...

30:41.187 --> 30:42.884
fling ourselves to the left.

30:42.928 --> 30:45.191
- Right.
- The left!

30:45.234 --> 30:46.757
Now!

30:53.895 --> 30:54.896
We have to stop Meister.

30:54.940 --> 30:56.855
- He's got Ultraviolet
protecting him.

30:56.898 --> 30:58.378
Her powers could kill us both.

30:58.421 --> 30:59.945
- Then let's do things
your way,

30:59.988 --> 31:02.382
with a little finesse.

31:02.425 --> 31:04.601
Time to suit up.

31:22.184 --> 31:24.317
- Good evening,
meine freunde.

31:24.360 --> 31:27.189
The moment that you've
all been waiting for is here.

31:27.233 --> 31:29.061
Let the auction begin.

31:29.104 --> 31:34.370
The EYE-3C9 satellite system,

31:34.414 --> 31:37.634
or as I'd like to call it
the Ring of Fire,

31:37.678 --> 31:42.726
is equipped with 15 dioptric
long-range missiles.

31:42.770 --> 31:44.163
Simply use this console

31:44.206 --> 31:46.948
to enter our desired
coordinates,

31:46.992 --> 31:48.689
and then sit back

31:48.732 --> 31:54.390
and watch hellfire
reign down on your enemies.

31:54.434 --> 31:58.568
Perhaps a little
demonstration now, yes?

32:16.238 --> 32:18.937
- This isn't the bathroom.

32:21.243 --> 32:22.723
Sorry, sorry.

32:22.766 --> 32:27.206
- Mr. Allen Barry, I see
you have found the open bar.

32:27.249 --> 32:29.077
- Keep her busy till
I get to that console.

32:29.121 --> 32:32.428
- I'll bid on your
stupid laptop.

32:32.472 --> 32:34.039
- $500 million.

32:34.082 --> 32:36.563
- $500 million and one dollar.

32:36.606 --> 32:38.478
"Price is Right" rules.

32:38.521 --> 32:41.089
- Ultraviolet, uh, gently
escort Mr. Barry out,

32:41.133 --> 32:43.962
but don't burn his money.

32:46.094 --> 32:48.488
- I love "Mortal Kombat"!

32:51.056 --> 32:53.536
- Mr. Dibny, we meet again.

32:53.580 --> 32:55.451
- You've got to take it easy
on the Bond quotes, man.

32:55.495 --> 32:57.888
- You know what
my favorite part is?

32:57.932 --> 32:59.716
"Finish him!"

32:59.760 --> 33:02.806
- You know, usually I allow
Ultraviolet to do the killing.

33:08.203 --> 33:10.814
But for you,
I'll make an exception.

33:15.297 --> 33:17.082
Ha!
- Come on!

33:43.195 --> 33:45.066
Fire in the hole.

34:11.049 --> 34:15.792
- ♪ The time it has come

34:15.836 --> 34:21.320
♪ To destroy

34:21.363 --> 34:25.759
♪ Your supremacy

34:41.122 --> 34:42.384
- Thanks for dropping in.

34:54.614 --> 34:57.182
- Really?
Adjusting your tie?

34:57.225 --> 34:58.705
- Adjusting the flash.

35:23.730 --> 35:24.992
- Nice job, man.

35:31.129 --> 35:32.739
- Shocking.

35:32.782 --> 35:35.002
- Your performance...

35:35.045 --> 35:37.178
Wunderbar,Mr. Barry.

35:39.049 --> 35:41.965
- The name's Allen.

35:42.009 --> 35:43.706
Barry Allen.

35:49.277 --> 35:52.628
- Remington Meister's
crime ring is over.

35:52.672 --> 35:55.022
- Glad we got Remington, but
I'm sorry we didn't find Sue.

35:55.065 --> 35:57.329
- My nose tells me there's more
to that case than I imagine.

35:57.372 --> 35:59.113
- You'll find her.
- I will.

35:59.157 --> 36:02.203
And in the meantime, I'll be
busy keeping Central City safe.

36:02.247 --> 36:04.336
We still on for
that ceremony today, Joe?

36:04.379 --> 36:06.207
- Oh yeah, see you there.

36:09.558 --> 36:11.256
- So did you do it?

36:11.299 --> 36:12.605
Did you embrace
your new identity?

36:12.648 --> 36:14.259
Did you see Natalie?
Did you ask her out?

36:14.302 --> 36:16.609
Did she say yes?
- Yes, yes, and no.

36:16.652 --> 36:17.914
- Oh.

36:17.958 --> 36:21.266
Chester, I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

36:21.309 --> 36:24.878
- I've actually never
felt better.

36:24.921 --> 36:27.228
- Uh, the last time
I went to ask Natalie out,

36:27.272 --> 36:28.316
I was scared as hell.

36:28.360 --> 36:30.579
Today, I conquered that fear.

36:30.623 --> 36:34.583
Yo, she said no,
but I said yes to me.

36:34.627 --> 36:38.021
- All right, well,
I am very happy for you.

36:38.065 --> 36:39.719
I think.

36:39.762 --> 36:41.547
- Hey, you're--
you're marketing your firm.

36:41.590 --> 36:45.812
- Yeah, yeah, it is the first
step in embracing the new me.

36:45.855 --> 36:47.422
- Wow.

36:47.466 --> 36:50.469
- You know, I wanted to thank
you for your encouragement.

36:50.512 --> 36:53.385
And speaking of encouragement,

36:53.428 --> 36:56.779
you know, you'd fit in nicely
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

36:58.303 --> 37:01.044
Don't be a stranger.

37:01.088 --> 37:03.264
- That...

37:03.308 --> 37:07.007
would be so epic!

37:07.050 --> 37:09.009
Epic.
Epic.

37:09.052 --> 37:11.446
- Epic.

37:18.323 --> 37:20.586
- Here you go.

37:25.330 --> 37:26.374
- Better?

37:26.418 --> 37:28.071
- Yeah, thanks.

37:28.115 --> 37:29.682
- You're welcome.

37:29.725 --> 37:31.727
- Why are you being
so nice to me?

37:33.033 --> 37:35.818
Let's just say you
remind me of someone.

37:35.862 --> 37:38.473
- Another doppelganger.
- Something like that.

37:38.517 --> 37:40.780
Hey, um...

37:42.477 --> 37:44.174
Good job.

38:10.375 --> 38:11.724
- The last five years,

38:11.767 --> 38:13.813
I've tried to keep
Central City safe.

38:15.597 --> 38:18.034
But as new threats arise,
you'll need more than me.

38:18.078 --> 38:21.473
Which is why I'm proud
to recognize a hero

38:21.516 --> 38:23.562
who's put his life
on the line for this city

38:23.605 --> 38:26.042
time and time again.

38:26.086 --> 38:29.394
A hero who deserves
our recognition.

38:29.437 --> 38:31.396
The Elongated Man.

38:35.791 --> 38:40.448
Now Central City
has another symbol of hope.

38:54.419 --> 38:56.464
- To every woman, every man,

38:56.508 --> 38:59.598
and every child
listening today,

38:59.641 --> 39:03.515
I have wanted to protect
Central City

39:03.558 --> 39:06.387
since before I ever even
got my powers.

39:06.431 --> 39:10.435
This is my home
and I love it here.

39:12.393 --> 39:13.699
And so today,
I hereby promise

39:13.742 --> 39:17.442
that I will defend Central City

39:17.485 --> 39:20.270
with my dying breath.

39:25.232 --> 39:26.581
Before we wrap up,

39:26.625 --> 39:29.236
there is someone
that Captain West and I

39:29.279 --> 39:30.455
would like to bring up here.

39:30.498 --> 39:33.458
CSI Barry Allen,
please come up.

39:37.462 --> 39:39.812
- What are you doing?

39:41.074 --> 39:45.557
- Uh, those who wear capes
and costumes

39:45.600 --> 39:47.559
aren't the only ones
that keep us safe.

39:47.602 --> 39:51.606
There are some
unsung heroes as well,

39:51.650 --> 39:53.826
like this man.

39:53.869 --> 39:59.614
This man has solved crimes to
give mourning families justice.

39:59.658 --> 40:02.530
He's a CCPD team member

40:02.574 --> 40:06.012
who's never given up
on a single case.

40:06.055 --> 40:10.886
This man has saved Central City
more times than anyone knows.

40:10.930 --> 40:14.499
So it's time
that we thank him.

40:14.542 --> 40:16.979
It's time that...

40:18.154 --> 40:20.505
that I thank him.

40:20.548 --> 40:23.638
So without further ado...

40:23.682 --> 40:26.598
- Officer Barry Allen,
on behalf of CCPD,

40:26.641 --> 40:28.687
we present you with
their highest honor--

40:28.730 --> 40:30.471
the Medal of Honor.

40:30.515 --> 40:33.518
Thank you for your service.

40:58.847 --> 41:01.502
- Pretty cool, huh?
Look how shiny it is.

41:01.546 --> 41:03.112
- Yeah, that's great, Ralph.

41:03.156 --> 41:05.724
Um, is this why you wanted
to meet me?

41:05.767 --> 41:07.465
- Yes.

41:07.508 --> 41:10.598
And I wanted to show you this.

41:10.642 --> 41:13.296
I took it at Meister's party.

41:13.340 --> 41:15.037
- I recognize that pin.

41:15.081 --> 41:17.562
- Guess who else showed up
in Midway City?

41:17.605 --> 41:19.738
- Ultraviolet?

41:19.781 --> 41:22.349
Thanks, Ralph.
"The Citizen" is on it.

41:38.887 --> 41:40.715
- Great press conference.

41:42.325 --> 41:45.720
I have a follow up question.

42:12.312 --> 42:13.748
- Greg, move your head!
