00:16.484 --> 00:19.743
God, this isn't happening.

00:25.858 --> 00:27.926
Please, I just wanna go home!

00:41.640 --> 00:44.142
Come on!

00:46.711 --> 00:49.180
There's nowhere to go.

00:49.248 --> 00:51.481
Your friends are all dead.

00:53.151 --> 00:54.817
It's just you and me now.

00:54.885 --> 00:56.520
Please!

01:09.132 --> 01:11.367
No, no, no.

01:11.435 --> 01:14.537
Don't waste all those
beautiful screams...

01:15.972 --> 01:19.208
We've got the whole night
ahead of us.

01:23.712 --> 01:25.080
It's play time!

01:30.152 --> 01:31.386
Agh!

01:37.126 --> 01:38.059
Cut!

01:39.727 --> 01:42.796
Great take, guys!
I love the energy.

01:42.863 --> 01:44.164
Are you okay, Nikki?

01:44.232 --> 01:46.967
It's my wrist.
I think it might be broken.

01:47.034 --> 01:48.402
Come here, let me look.

01:48.470 --> 01:50.137
Good work, Vince.
You all right?

01:50.205 --> 01:51.505
Vince?

01:53.708 --> 01:55.908
Call 911!
Vince is down!

01:55.976 --> 01:57.110
That's real blood, man.

01:57.177 --> 01:58.077
He's been shot!

01:58.145 --> 01:59.479
How is that possible?

01:59.546 --> 02:00.846
The gun was supposed
to have blanks in it!

02:00.914 --> 02:02.615
It did! I loaded it myself.
It was full blanks!

02:02.682 --> 02:04.049
He's not breathing!

02:04.118 --> 02:05.918
Come on, Vince,
don't do this to me, buddy!

02:05.986 --> 02:07.453
Wake up!

02:07.521 --> 02:08.821
Is he...

02:09.955 --> 02:10.955
He's dead.

02:16.525 --> 02:18.756

02:39.717 --> 02:40.851
Is it true?

02:40.919 --> 02:42.486
Oh, wow, this is a circus.

02:42.554 --> 02:46.457
I thought Klein wanted
to keep this off the radar.

02:46.525 --> 02:49.393
This has to be a hoax.

02:49.461 --> 02:51.195
I love you, Vince.

02:51.263 --> 02:53.464
I can't believe he's dead.

02:53.532 --> 02:55.598
- Hey.
- Can you believe it?

02:55.666 --> 02:56.832
This guy's been dead two hours

02:56.900 --> 02:58.668
and already the vultures
are circling.

02:58.735 --> 03:00.203
How did word get out so fast?

03:00.271 --> 03:01.571
It goes out on Twitter

03:01.638 --> 03:02.872
five minutes before
the ambulance arrives

03:02.940 --> 03:04.006
and before you know it,

03:04.075 --> 03:04.941
the whole thing's gone viral.

03:05.008 --> 03:06.609
Body's not even cold yet.

03:06.677 --> 03:08.778
Welcome to the future.
Was this guy popular?

03:08.845 --> 03:10.280
Yeah, Vince Masterson,

03:10.347 --> 03:12.548
a big cult movie star.

03:12.616 --> 03:14.083
Now this was supposed to be

03:14.150 --> 03:16.919
his triumphant
big screen comeback...

03:16.987 --> 03:18.588
"Death Manor"...

03:18.655 --> 03:21.824
A remake of a popular '70s
scream-sploitation movie.

03:21.892 --> 03:23.759
That's Dev's word, not mine.

03:23.827 --> 03:25.094
He also said that
the original movie

03:25.161 --> 03:26.462
was thought to be cursed,

03:26.529 --> 03:28.964
that one of the actors
died during filming

03:29.031 --> 03:30.599
and there's some other
tragedies that surround it.

03:30.666 --> 03:31.967
I don't know.

03:32.034 --> 03:34.035
So what's the story here?

03:34.103 --> 03:36.939
We know that Masterson
was shot twice in the chest

03:37.059 --> 03:38.339
with a 9 millimeter,

03:38.407 --> 03:40.675
with a gun that was supposed
to shoot blanks.

03:40.743 --> 03:42.710
So the blanks were switched out
with real bullets?

03:42.777 --> 03:44.211
No, the whole gun
was switched out.

03:44.278 --> 03:45.345
Now the props master,

03:45.413 --> 03:47.481
he swears he put
the fake gun on set

03:47.548 --> 03:48.716
just prior to the incident,

03:48.783 --> 03:50.618
but at some point

03:50.685 --> 03:51.752
it was replaced
with the real deal

03:51.820 --> 03:53.153
and no one saw the switch,

03:53.221 --> 03:54.321
and we still haven't found
the props gun.

03:54.388 --> 03:55.656
So who's the shooter?

03:55.724 --> 03:57.858
An actress by the name
of Nikki Hutton.

03:57.926 --> 03:59.259
She seems pretty shaken up.

04:01.795 --> 04:03.430
Are you Nikki Hutton?

04:03.498 --> 04:05.499
You mind if I take a look?

04:09.069 --> 04:11.871
Ah, yeah, sprain, huh?
Maybe hairline fracture?

04:11.939 --> 04:13.940
You gonna take her in
for an X-ray?

04:14.008 --> 04:15.074
I'm Sergeant McKluskey.

04:15.142 --> 04:16.942
This is Special Consultant
Logan.

04:17.010 --> 04:18.709
Can we ask you a few questions?

04:18.778 --> 04:19.878
You guys have to do this now?

04:19.946 --> 04:21.247
It's okay, go ahead.

04:21.314 --> 04:22.615
The gun that you fired,

04:22.682 --> 04:24.583
you didn't realize
that it wasn't a prop?

04:24.651 --> 04:27.919
I was in character.
It was in the moment.

04:27.987 --> 04:30.856
It looked the same,
it weighed the same.

04:40.031 --> 04:41.931
Okay, you can bring her in.

04:41.999 --> 04:44.401
I'll check in on you soon,
sweetie, okay?

04:58.014 --> 04:59.882
So you two are with
the film crew?

04:59.949 --> 05:02.652
Uh, yeah, Zack Gladstone,
director, producer, writer.

05:02.719 --> 05:04.720
Rick Robson,
Vince's body double.

05:04.788 --> 05:05.954
Can either of you
think of someone

05:06.022 --> 05:07.557
who might have had a beef
with Vince?

05:07.624 --> 05:09.492
No, he was...

05:09.560 --> 05:11.627
Everybody's best friend,
you know?

05:11.695 --> 05:14.329
A good man, a great actor...

05:14.397 --> 05:16.565
and my meal ticket.

05:16.632 --> 05:18.167
Yeah, I second that.

05:18.234 --> 05:19.868
I mean, the guy was a pro.
Hell, if it wasn't for him,

05:19.936 --> 05:21.203
this movie may not have
even happened.

05:21.270 --> 05:22.838
What do you mean?

05:22.906 --> 05:23.972
I've been trying
to get the project

05:24.040 --> 05:25.373
off the ground for years,

05:25.441 --> 05:27.775
but the studio wanted
a more experienced director,

05:27.843 --> 05:28.843
not a first-timer.

05:28.911 --> 05:30.444
So I brought the project
to Vince

05:30.512 --> 05:32.847
and he went to bat for me.

05:32.915 --> 05:35.016
It's his movie
as much as it is mine.

05:35.084 --> 05:37.819
And not a day went
by that he didn't remind me of that.

05:37.886 --> 05:39.520
So, now that your star is dead,

05:39.588 --> 05:40.922
what's gonna happen
with the film?

05:40.989 --> 05:42.289
We'll get it finished.

05:42.357 --> 05:43.724
I mean, Vince would've
wanted us to keep going,

05:43.791 --> 05:45.058
curse or no curse.

05:45.126 --> 05:47.027
Oh, Zack, don't start up
with that crap.

05:47.095 --> 05:49.863
Yeah, we've heard
about this curse.

05:49.931 --> 05:51.898
The original '70s
version of "Death Manor"

05:51.966 --> 05:53.934
was actually shot
at this same mansion,

05:54.001 --> 05:55.135
and during the shoot

05:55.203 --> 05:56.703
the actor playing
The Blood Butcher

05:56.771 --> 05:58.404
was killed
when a stunt went wrong.

05:58.472 --> 06:01.107
I mean, a fireplace poker
actually impaled him.

06:01.174 --> 06:03.508
And do you believe
in this curse?

06:03.576 --> 06:06.011
For me, it's all about
getting my movie made.

06:06.079 --> 06:08.013
- Thank you.
- Break a leg.

06:08.081 --> 06:09.381
Thank you.

06:19.591 --> 06:20.859
All right, that's
enough for tonight.

06:20.926 --> 06:23.561
I'll swing by
and get the last load

06:23.629 --> 06:24.863
tomorrow before work.

06:24.930 --> 06:26.264
This is awesome.

06:26.331 --> 06:27.598
I can't believe we're actually
living together.

06:29.101 --> 06:30.534
Easy, babe,
you know it's only until

06:30.602 --> 06:31.802
the loft Reno is done.

06:31.870 --> 06:33.603
Yeah, but you know
what this means, right?

06:33.671 --> 06:36.673
At least for a month or two,
it's sex on demand.

06:36.741 --> 06:37.875
No travel required.

06:39.177 --> 06:41.044
It's so cute
that you believe that.

06:41.112 --> 06:42.579
Oh really?

06:42.647 --> 06:43.914
Hey, isn't that
Toby and Michelle?

06:43.982 --> 06:46.784
Holy crap, it is!
Where's the remote?

06:46.851 --> 06:48.350
Live at the
scene where sources tell us

06:48.418 --> 06:50.887
that beloved genre actor
Vince Masterson

06:50.954 --> 06:53.555
has been shot and killed
during filming

06:53.623 --> 06:55.291
of the remake
of "Death Manor."

06:55.358 --> 06:56.292
Toby's on the set
of "Death Manor"?

06:56.359 --> 06:57.794
I love that movie!

06:57.861 --> 06:59.195
A cult film from the '70s,

06:59.263 --> 07:00.596
it was intended to be
the stepping stone

07:00.664 --> 07:03.266
for Masterson's big comeback.

07:03.333 --> 07:04.900
Dude, you're on the set
of "Death Manor"?

07:04.967 --> 07:06.768
I just saw you on the news!

07:06.836 --> 07:08.870
This is a crime scene, okay?
This is not a set tour.

07:08.938 --> 07:10.471
Oh, come on,
is The Blood Butcher dead?

07:10.539 --> 07:11.973
That's gotta be
a publicity stunt, right?

07:12.041 --> 07:15.210
It's not a publicity stunt.
It's real, he's gone.

07:15.278 --> 07:16.511
Do me a favour.
While you're there,

07:16.578 --> 07:18.313
don't go into any scary
basements or attics

07:18.380 --> 07:19.614
and stick to the buddy system.

07:19.682 --> 07:21.381
- I gotta go.
- All right, bye.

07:25.320 --> 07:26.120
I think I got
everything I need.

07:26.188 --> 07:27.387
Thank you very much.

07:27.455 --> 07:30.191
- Hey, Rick.
- Rick.

07:30.258 --> 07:33.160
Welcome to the last house
you'll ever see.

07:33.228 --> 07:34.561
What?

07:34.629 --> 07:36.095
It's the logline
from the original movie.

07:36.163 --> 07:37.096
It was on the poster.

07:37.164 --> 07:39.065
No, don't know it.

07:39.133 --> 07:41.034
Really?

07:41.101 --> 07:42.635
Okay, forget it.

07:42.703 --> 07:44.537
I've been interviewing everyone
who had access to the set

07:44.604 --> 07:45.972
two hours before the shooting

07:46.040 --> 07:48.842
and no one has any idea
how the gun was switched.

07:48.909 --> 07:50.443
You guys find anything
interesting?

07:50.510 --> 07:52.744
We talked to Nikki.
She's genuinely shook up.

07:52.812 --> 07:54.313
Zack, the director,

07:54.380 --> 07:57.149
did not seem to be all that
upset about Vince's death.

07:57.217 --> 07:58.783
No, no, I read him.

07:58.852 --> 08:00.585
He's not as enamoured of Vince
as he would like us to believe.

08:00.653 --> 08:03.455
Okay, that's interesting.
Now it's my turn.

08:03.522 --> 08:04.656
Looked at the numbers
from the gun

08:04.724 --> 08:05.858
that was used in the shooting,

08:05.925 --> 08:07.625
it was registered
to Vince himself.

08:07.693 --> 08:09.126
He was carrying a piece?

08:09.194 --> 08:10.361
Yeah, apparently he's been
getting death threats,

08:10.428 --> 08:11.729
but I checked

08:11.796 --> 08:12.930
and he never reported them
to the police.

08:12.998 --> 08:15.366
So he got himself a gun.
Nice.

08:15.433 --> 08:16.700
Gun's on the way to processing

08:16.768 --> 08:18.836
and the body's on the way
to the morgue.

08:18.904 --> 08:21.339
I have seen a lot
of blood as a paramedic,

08:21.406 --> 08:23.774
but this is a lot of blood.

08:23.842 --> 08:25.208
But most of it's fake.

08:25.276 --> 08:26.309
It's just corn syrup
and food colouring,

08:26.377 --> 08:27.510
but it looks real, doesn't it?

08:27.578 --> 08:28.678
You like this stuff, don't you?

08:28.746 --> 08:30.146
Are you kidding?

08:30.214 --> 08:32.115
I was raised on a steady diet
of horror flicks.

08:32.183 --> 08:33.649
I mean, this is my wheel house,

08:33.717 --> 08:35.717
and to be standing
in the original "Death Manor,"

08:35.785 --> 08:37.553
this is like church.

08:37.621 --> 08:38.855
Well, when you're finished
your sermon,

08:38.923 --> 08:40.289
you can fill me in on the rest.

08:41.357 --> 08:42.424
If they ask you anything,

08:42.491 --> 08:44.025
you clear it
through me first, okay?

08:44.094 --> 08:46.528
- Okay.
- Thanks.

08:47.530 --> 08:49.498
Hey there. IIB.

08:49.565 --> 08:50.966
Can we talk for a minute?

08:51.034 --> 08:52.368
Of course.
We're all anxious

08:52.435 --> 08:54.303
to get to the bottom
of who killed poor Vince.

08:54.371 --> 08:57.105
And you are? Angela
Harvey, Unit Publicist.

08:57.172 --> 08:59.473
This is a great tragedy.

08:59.541 --> 09:00.909
Yeah, it is.

09:00.976 --> 09:01.910
Look, we're gonna need
everyone to tell us

09:01.977 --> 09:03.244
everything they know.

09:03.312 --> 09:04.745
Yeah, of course.
I'll make sure everyone knows.

09:04.813 --> 09:06.580
Had you worked
with Vince before?

09:06.648 --> 09:09.450
Yeah, I had the pleasure
of working with Vince

09:09.518 --> 09:11.019
on his last six pictures.

09:11.086 --> 09:14.021
Can you think of anyone
who'd want to hurt him?

09:14.088 --> 09:15.522
No.

09:16.190 --> 09:17.757
He was the kind of guy
who brought coffee to the crew.

09:17.825 --> 09:20.093
Everyone loved him.

09:20.161 --> 09:21.929
Mostly because none
of them would be working without him.

09:21.996 --> 09:23.830
You find out what
happened to my husband?!

09:23.898 --> 09:26.266
Rachel, I promise you,
they are looking into it.

09:26.334 --> 09:27.934
I can't believe this.

09:30.503 --> 09:32.871
Hi, Ms. Masterson,
I'm Toby Logan.

09:32.940 --> 09:35.041
I'm with the IIB.
I'm sorry for your loss.

09:35.108 --> 09:36.608
Why is this happening?

09:36.676 --> 09:39.412
We're gonna find
whoever did this and...

09:39.479 --> 09:42.915
do you know anyone
who'd want to hurt your husband?

09:46.385 --> 09:47.652
Enough!

09:47.719 --> 09:50.909
We loved each other so much.

09:51.424 --> 09:54.292
Come here, come here.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.527
- Not right now.
- Sorry.

10:01.632 --> 10:03.000
Anything?

10:03.068 --> 10:05.802
Well, I'm trying to figure out
if she was lying.

10:05.870 --> 10:08.405
Her and Vince had
a volatile relationship.

10:08.473 --> 10:10.207
All right, I'm gonna go
check out Masterson's trailer

10:10.275 --> 10:11.675
and see what I can find there.

10:11.742 --> 10:13.743
You guys might want to talk
to the props master,

10:13.811 --> 10:15.479
Gary Mailor,
see what he has to say.

10:16.447 --> 10:18.547
I'm telling you,
I followed protocol to a tee.

10:18.615 --> 10:20.350
I set the blank rounds
in the gun

10:20.417 --> 10:21.750
and then I just staged it
on its mark.

10:21.818 --> 10:23.519
The set A.D. can back me up.

10:23.587 --> 10:25.521
Do you have any idea
where the prop gun ended up?

10:25.589 --> 10:27.790
Not a clue.
It just disappeared.

10:27.858 --> 10:29.192
Do you know
who could've changed it?

10:29.259 --> 10:30.659
Anybody with access to the set.

10:30.727 --> 10:34.210
So, myself, actor,

10:34.330 --> 10:36.865
pretty much anybody
that's on the crew.

10:36.932 --> 10:38.600
Okay, were you and Vince close?

10:38.667 --> 10:41.436
Hey, he's the talent.
I'm a technician.

10:41.504 --> 10:43.372
I'm just doing my job.

10:43.439 --> 10:46.674
Maybe now they'll
start believing in the curse.

10:46.742 --> 10:50.011
What do you think
about this curse?

10:50.078 --> 10:51.845
Before today, I was pretty sure

10:51.913 --> 10:53.747
that this place had
some seriously bad mojo,

10:53.815 --> 10:55.949
but now I'm certain of it.

10:56.018 --> 10:58.185
I mean, the actor who played
The Blood Butcher

10:58.253 --> 11:00.054
was killed here not once,
but twice.

11:00.122 --> 11:01.688
If not a curse, then what?

11:01.756 --> 11:03.290
How about premeditated murder?

11:03.358 --> 11:05.725
Oh, a flesh and blood killer?
That I can handle,

11:05.792 --> 11:07.827
but you can't run from a curse.

11:07.895 --> 11:09.262
Sooner or later,
it's gonna catch up to you.

11:12.966 --> 11:15.101
This is the first time
that we have the murder weapon

11:15.169 --> 11:16.836
and an I.D. on the shooter,

11:16.904 --> 11:18.871
yet it's still not enough
to go on.

11:18.939 --> 11:20.139
We have several individuals

11:20.206 --> 11:21.907
who had opportunity
to plant the gun,

11:21.974 --> 11:23.775
but what we're lacking
is motive.

11:23.843 --> 11:25.710
Well, everyone that Michelle
and I talked to,

11:25.778 --> 11:27.112
they spoke highly of Vince,

11:27.180 --> 11:28.747
but they were thinking
otherwise.

11:28.814 --> 11:30.349
So this guy was unpopular.

11:30.417 --> 11:31.750
Love him or hate him,

11:31.817 --> 11:33.318
a lot of people were riding
on his back, though.

11:33.386 --> 11:34.786
Did you talk to the wife?

11:34.854 --> 11:36.654
She had access
to Masterson's gun.

11:36.721 --> 11:38.423
Yeah, Toby
talked to her briefly,

11:38.490 --> 11:40.591
but the set doctor had given her
a bunch of sedatives.

11:40.659 --> 11:41.926
She was pretty out of it.

11:41.993 --> 11:43.194
What about this actress, Nikki?

11:43.262 --> 11:44.695
She's the one
that grabbed the gun

11:44.763 --> 11:46.130
and put two slugs in his chest.

11:46.198 --> 11:47.765
Maybe she arranged it too.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.600
No, I don't think so.
I was inside her head.

11:49.668 --> 11:51.663
Her pain and grief
were genuine.

11:52.070 --> 11:54.237
I can't believe you
guys just left me there.

11:54.305 --> 11:55.405
Don't you know what happens
to brothers

11:55.473 --> 11:56.540
when they get separated
from the group

11:56.607 --> 11:57.640
in horror movies?

11:57.708 --> 11:59.209
Bad things, that's what.

11:59.277 --> 12:01.478
All right, did you grab
Masterson's laptop?

12:01.546 --> 12:04.114
Yeah, it was in his trailer.
I'll see what I can find on it.

12:04.182 --> 12:05.848
I also found these.

12:10.087 --> 12:11.387
Divorce papers.

12:11.455 --> 12:13.522
Divorce papers
with an ironclad pre-nup.

12:13.590 --> 12:15.691
Those go through
and the former Ms. Masterson

12:15.758 --> 12:16.658
doesn't get a thing.

12:16.726 --> 12:17.893
Vince took a bullet

12:17.961 --> 12:20.662
and his new widow
just dodged one.

12:20.730 --> 12:23.665
I think we just
found our primary suspect.

12:30.344 --> 12:33.146
Don't you people
have any decency?

12:33.214 --> 12:34.781
My husband was just killed.

12:34.849 --> 12:36.216
Look, we understand
how difficult this is

12:36.284 --> 12:38.350
for you, okay,

12:38.418 --> 12:42.154
But we need to know if
you had access to your husband's gun.

12:42.222 --> 12:43.956
 Of course,

12:44.024 --> 12:46.959
but I never touched it.
I hate guns.

12:47.027 --> 12:49.661
I hated that Vince carried it
with him constantly.

12:49.729 --> 12:52.531
Did he have a gun
because of the death threats?

12:52.598 --> 12:54.970
At first, sure,

12:56.101 --> 12:57.468
but, eventually,
I think he just liked

12:57.536 --> 12:59.337
having it with him.

13:00.306 --> 13:02.640
It made him feel
more in control.

13:02.708 --> 13:05.958
And was he?
In control?

13:06.078 --> 13:07.278
What do you mean?

13:07.346 --> 13:09.146
Well, we've heard
from some crew members

13:09.214 --> 13:11.157
that you and Vince
had been fighting.

13:11.782 --> 13:13.750
We've been together
a long time!

13:13.818 --> 13:15.352
We're both passionate people!

13:15.419 --> 13:16.686
Did things ever turn violent?

13:16.754 --> 13:17.654
No!

13:17.722 --> 13:18.822
Nothing like that.

13:20.758 --> 13:23.760
Vince has a loud bark,
but he's a puppy dog.

13:25.595 --> 13:28.630
He loves me.
He would never hurt me.

13:33.070 --> 13:34.536
You sure about that?

13:36.273 --> 13:38.274
That sneaky son of a bitch.

13:38.342 --> 13:41.609
Why do you think
he wanted a divorce?

13:53.356 --> 13:55.390
Was there another woman?

13:57.926 --> 13:59.126
I guess I always knew

13:59.194 --> 14:00.527
that wannabe
was gonna be trouble.

14:00.595 --> 14:02.062
You're referring
to his co-star, Nikki?

14:02.130 --> 14:05.065
Knowing Vince,
he probably pissed her off too.

14:05.133 --> 14:07.935
Maybe her having his gun on set
was no accident.

14:08.003 --> 14:10.971
When was the last time
that you talked to Vince?

14:11.039 --> 14:14.040
We spoke on the phone
this morning.

14:14.108 --> 14:18.111
I was on a flight in from LA
when he was killed.

14:20.847 --> 14:23.682
You know how I heard the news?

14:23.750 --> 14:25.785
The TV in an airport lounge.

14:28.022 --> 14:29.654
Can you imagine?

14:38.998 --> 14:40.265
I'll check her alibi.

14:40.333 --> 14:42.467
Dev's still working on
Vince's hard drive.

14:42.535 --> 14:43.802
Did you get anything?

14:43.869 --> 14:47.004
Yeah, she saw Vince
with his co-star, Nikki.

14:47.072 --> 14:49.006
They were about to hook up.

14:49.074 --> 14:52.176
I think it's time you two
talked to the Scream Queen.

14:56.848 --> 14:59.016
Hairline fracture,
you were right.

14:59.084 --> 15:00.217
How did you know?

15:00.285 --> 15:03.453
I was a paramedic
once upon a time.

15:03.520 --> 15:05.422
Hopefully I'm gonna be able
to get a few hours sleep

15:05.489 --> 15:07.324
before my call time tomorrow.

15:07.391 --> 15:09.359
You're going
back to work so soon?

15:09.427 --> 15:12.128
Yeah, I feel like Vince
would've wanted that.

15:12.196 --> 15:13.763
You two were close?

15:13.831 --> 15:15.365
We spent 12 to 14
hours a day together,

15:15.433 --> 15:16.399
for three months.

15:16.467 --> 15:17.566
We were friends.

15:17.633 --> 15:19.601
Were you guys anything
more than that?

15:19.669 --> 15:22.704
It wasn't serious.
We were just having some fun.

15:22.772 --> 15:24.806
Were you guys having an affair?

15:26.142 --> 15:28.277
Things like this happen
on movie sets.

15:28.345 --> 15:30.812
What happens in "Death Manor"
stays in "Death Manor."

15:30.880 --> 15:32.647
Yeah, something like that.

15:32.715 --> 15:34.415
I was going to break things off
with him

15:34.483 --> 15:36.451
before we finished filming.

15:36.518 --> 15:37.852
Even if he wasn't married,

15:37.919 --> 15:40.821
I don't think what we had
was meant to last.

15:40.889 --> 15:42.923
Do you know the irony
of this whole thing?

15:42.992 --> 15:45.026
My character wasn't even
supposed to shoot Vince.

15:45.094 --> 15:46.961
What do mean?

15:47.029 --> 15:48.196
Originally the cop's gun
wasn't supposed to be loaded

15:48.263 --> 15:50.464
and my character
would manage to escape

15:50.531 --> 15:51.564
and then somehow
The Blood Butcher

15:51.632 --> 15:53.166
managed to survive,

15:53.234 --> 15:55.369
and then these new pages
came in.

15:55.436 --> 15:57.637
So Zack changed the script?

15:57.705 --> 16:00.840
He got into a big fight
with the studio about it,

16:00.908 --> 16:02.542
but he got his way.

16:04.078 --> 16:05.111
Thank you.

16:07.981 --> 16:10.349
So why would Zack
make changes to a script

16:10.417 --> 16:12.251
that would put his meal ticket
in harm's way?

16:12.319 --> 16:13.986
Why don't we find out?

16:14.054 --> 16:15.121
Yeah.

16:24.730 --> 16:25.763
Mmm.

16:25.831 --> 16:27.132
Aw geez!

16:27.199 --> 16:28.599
What? What is it?
Are you okay?

16:28.667 --> 16:30.368
That!

16:30.436 --> 16:32.970
That was not here
when I went to bed last night!

16:33.039 --> 16:34.805
Yeah, I told you I was
bringing the last of my stuff

16:34.873 --> 16:35.840
over this morning.

16:35.908 --> 16:37.042
That is not stuff!

16:37.109 --> 16:39.309
Stuff is an ironing board
or a hair dryer,

16:39.377 --> 16:40.477
your "Sweet Valley High" books.

16:40.546 --> 16:41.712
That? That is an urn

16:41.780 --> 16:43.948
with a dead person in it!

16:44.016 --> 16:45.516
Okay, Oz, be nice.

16:45.584 --> 16:47.852
That's my Great Nana.
She was a wonderful woman.

16:47.920 --> 16:49.086
Okay, I know,

16:49.154 --> 16:50.421
I probably should
have warned you,

16:50.488 --> 16:51.355
but I promised my mom
I would take care of her

16:51.423 --> 16:54.257
while she was traveling.

16:54.324 --> 16:56.793
You're okay with it, right?

16:58.095 --> 16:59.896
Well...

16:59.964 --> 17:02.165
Nana would have loved you.

17:02.232 --> 17:03.266
Yeah?

17:07.872 --> 17:08.905
Okay.

17:10.138 --> 17:11.941
- Uh uh...
- Really?

17:12.008 --> 17:13.407
I'm sorry, but she's
staring right at me.

17:13.476 --> 17:14.810
What do you want from me?!

17:14.877 --> 17:16.811
Okay, you know what?
I have to go to work.

17:16.880 --> 17:19.095
Enjoy your day off.

17:19.214 --> 17:20.549
Okay.

17:20.617 --> 17:22.585
And be nice to my Nana.

17:36.031 --> 17:36.998
Hey.

17:38.400 --> 17:39.901
Oh. Oh!

17:40.769 --> 17:43.336
- You're welcome.
- Good morning.

17:43.404 --> 17:44.938
What have we got?

17:45.006 --> 17:47.273
Well, I've been going
through the footage

17:47.341 --> 17:49.242
trying to spot the moment
when the gun's got switched,

17:49.310 --> 17:50.877
but no dice.

17:50.945 --> 17:53.747
You sure you're not getting
a sneak preview of the movie?

17:53.815 --> 17:55.115
I'm not gonna lie,

17:55.182 --> 17:57.283
I did browse through
the original last night.

17:57.351 --> 18:01.353
It still holds up.
I also managed to track down

18:01.421 --> 18:03.355
the threats that were on
Vince's computer.

18:03.423 --> 18:04.724
They started over a year ago

18:04.791 --> 18:06.525
and the last one
was four months ago.

18:06.593 --> 18:07.593
Do we have an I.D.?

18:07.661 --> 18:08.728
Not yet.
I'm still working on it.

18:08.795 --> 18:10.663
How was the survivor girl?

18:10.731 --> 18:14.399
Survivor girl told us
that Zack changed the script

18:14.467 --> 18:16.768
the day before Vince
was killed.

18:16.836 --> 18:18.637
Okay, I had someone trace
the photo of Vince's body

18:18.704 --> 18:20.172
that appeared online.

18:20.240 --> 18:22.774
It looks like it originated
on Zack's cell phone.

18:34.886 --> 18:37.755
Well, it's a little
less creepy in the daytime.

18:37.822 --> 18:39.490
If you say so.

18:44.029 --> 18:45.729
Guys, grab your phones.
Get ready.

18:45.797 --> 18:46.896
Come on, lock it up.

18:46.964 --> 18:48.231
Finals, four minutes.

18:48.299 --> 18:50.066
Standby.

18:50.134 --> 18:51.635
All right, action!

18:54.038 --> 18:55.338
Okay, that's great.

18:55.406 --> 18:56.773
Now you look down.

18:58.476 --> 18:59.643
Follow the blood.

18:59.710 --> 19:01.611
You know she's got
nowhere to run.

19:07.717 --> 19:09.951
And cut!

19:10.019 --> 19:12.454
Check it!
That's my favourite.

19:14.123 --> 19:15.291
Thank you, sir.

19:15.358 --> 19:17.025
So, is that Rick?

19:17.093 --> 19:19.160
Yeah. Can't tell
the difference, right?

19:19.228 --> 19:20.761
I mean, Rick was born
to double Vince.

19:20.829 --> 19:22.397
You know what the best part is?

19:22.464 --> 19:23.998
What's that?

19:24.066 --> 19:24.932
Rick's a
certified stunt guy.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.067
He can work with real blades.

19:26.134 --> 19:27.368
Not the cheap looking
plastic ones

19:27.436 --> 19:28.469
that Gary supplies.

19:28.537 --> 19:30.305
That, my friends,
is authenticity.

19:30.372 --> 19:31.706
Real blade, is it?

19:31.773 --> 19:33.441
Yeah, I mean, we have to go back
to the fake one

19:33.509 --> 19:35.309
when Nikki arrives.

19:35.376 --> 19:38.612
Can we speak to you
somewhere a little bit more private?

19:38.680 --> 19:39.814
Uh, Lisa, leave it on,

19:39.881 --> 19:41.648
and we're gonna go again
in five!

19:45.553 --> 19:46.553
Great.

19:50.358 --> 19:51.490
Hey, Zack.

19:51.558 --> 19:53.126
Um, you have this blank.

19:53.194 --> 19:55.394
- No, get rid of that.
- Okay, perfect.

19:55.462 --> 19:57.230
What can I do for you guys?

19:57.297 --> 19:59.298
You leaked the photo.

19:59.366 --> 20:00.734
Okay, sure, I took the picture.

20:00.801 --> 20:01.968
I thought it might...

20:02.036 --> 20:03.002
Get a little bit
of extra publicity.

20:03.070 --> 20:04.403
Every little bit helps,
you know?

20:04.471 --> 20:06.806
I have a responsibility
to the money men.

20:06.874 --> 20:08.708
Why did you change the script?

20:08.775 --> 20:11.277
It wasn't supposed to be Vince
that got shot.

20:11.345 --> 20:14.113
We want to capitalize
on Nikki's performance.

20:14.180 --> 20:15.381
Don't tell her,

20:15.449 --> 20:16.249
but we want to make her
the survivor girl

20:16.316 --> 20:17.816
for the sequels.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.184
You know, The Blood Butcher,
he can die and come back.

20:19.253 --> 20:22.221
He's The Blood Butcher.

20:23.156 --> 20:25.757
What, I'm a suspect?
Let me tell you something.

20:25.824 --> 20:27.925
I've had to rip apart
my entire movie

20:27.993 --> 20:30.328
just to try to make it work
without him.

20:30.396 --> 20:31.829
And just so you know,

20:31.897 --> 20:33.698
I was the last one
to get to set for that shot.

20:33.766 --> 20:35.667
Zack,
we have a crisis in wardrobe.

20:35.735 --> 20:36.968
Look, guys, I'm sorry,

20:37.035 --> 20:38.570
but I gotta get back to work,
okay?

20:40.071 --> 20:42.506
Dev, what's going on?

20:42.574 --> 20:43.840
I got the results back
on the gun.

20:43.908 --> 20:45.208
Other than Vince and Nikki,

20:45.277 --> 20:46.710
there's only one other set
of prints on it.

20:46.778 --> 20:48.479
Vince's wife.

20:48.546 --> 20:50.113
Actually, no.

20:50.181 --> 20:53.651
A lady named Angela Harvey,
she's a publicist on the unit.

20:53.718 --> 20:55.285
Her prints were on file
from a possession charge

20:55.352 --> 20:56.286
a few years back.

20:56.320 --> 20:58.086
Angela Harvey?

21:01.691 --> 21:03.124
Thanks, Dev.

21:03.192 --> 21:05.594
So why would the publicist's
prints be on the gun?

21:05.662 --> 21:08.764
Maybe she's feeding
the PR machine.

21:19.616 --> 21:21.684
Angela Harvey?

21:21.752 --> 21:23.118
Hey, can we chat for a minute?

21:23.186 --> 21:24.553
Of course.

21:24.620 --> 21:26.888
Whatever I can do to assist
with your investigation.

21:26.957 --> 21:28.824
Vince was a close
personal friend.

21:28.891 --> 21:29.992
Do you make it a habit

21:30.060 --> 21:33.795
of suing your close
personal friends?

21:33.863 --> 21:35.230
We know about the lawsuit.

21:35.298 --> 21:37.380
It's complicated.

21:37.500 --> 21:38.799
Well, we have time.

21:40.035 --> 21:42.303
Look, I don't wanna
do this forever.

21:42.371 --> 21:45.106
I was looking for
a smart business opportunity

21:45.174 --> 21:48.076
and celebrity-backed restaurants
are cash cows.

21:48.143 --> 21:50.878
So talked to Vince
about going in with me,

21:50.946 --> 21:52.380
I put up the capital,

21:52.448 --> 21:53.681
and he was the face

21:53.748 --> 21:55.048
who was gonna bring in
the customers.

21:55.116 --> 21:56.316
So what happened?

21:56.384 --> 21:58.885
He backed out
at the last minute.

22:00.521 --> 22:02.356
I had everything I owned
in that project

22:02.423 --> 22:04.191
and it all disappeared
overnight.

22:04.258 --> 22:05.392
You must have hated him.

22:05.460 --> 22:07.527
No, it was business.

22:07.595 --> 22:10.562
So was the suit,
but I never hated Vince.

22:10.630 --> 22:12.231
I'd like to show you something.

22:14.801 --> 22:16.068
Why are you showing me that?

22:16.136 --> 22:17.903
'Cause it's a photo
of the murder weapon

22:17.971 --> 22:19.738
and your prints
are all over it.

22:19.806 --> 22:21.640
I had absolutely
nothing to do with his death.

22:21.708 --> 22:23.876
So how are your prints
on the gun?

22:23.943 --> 22:25.511
I was in his trailer
the other day.

22:25.578 --> 22:28.679
He was waving the gun around,
showing it off.

22:31.050 --> 22:33.518
Hey, what is thing?!

22:33.585 --> 22:35.653
What, are you crazy?

22:35.721 --> 22:37.989
I took it away from him.

22:38.057 --> 22:39.757
If someone had got a picture
of him drunk

22:39.825 --> 22:41.126
and waving that thing around,

22:41.193 --> 22:43.293
it would have been
a publicity nightmare!

22:43.361 --> 22:44.661
So you took the gun.

22:44.729 --> 22:45.729
No.

22:47.399 --> 22:50.734
I gave it back to him
and told him to get rid of it.

22:53.004 --> 22:55.439
I realize now
that if I'd taken it

22:55.507 --> 22:57.041
and disposed of it myself

22:57.108 --> 22:58.541
he'd still be alive.

23:02.679 --> 23:04.480
All right,
thanks for your time.

23:04.548 --> 23:06.149
Yeah.

23:06.216 --> 23:08.251
Excuse me.

23:10.154 --> 23:11.454
She's telling the truth.

23:11.522 --> 23:13.289
Well, she's still a suspect.

23:13.357 --> 23:14.322
Mmm-hmm.

23:14.390 --> 23:16.791
Oh.
Yeah, what's going on?

23:16.859 --> 23:18.760
Dev ran the wife's alibi.
It doesn't check out.

23:18.827 --> 23:21.063
She actually arrived
on an earlier flight.

23:21.130 --> 23:22.764
Head to her hotel
and pick her up.

23:27.236 --> 23:29.371
You lied to us, Rachel.

23:29.439 --> 23:30.704
I mean, you must have known

23:30.772 --> 23:33.107
that we were gonna check out
your story.

23:34.909 --> 23:37.044
I just panicked.

23:37.112 --> 23:40.181
My husband is dead.
I wasn't thinking clearly.

23:40.248 --> 23:41.515
Why'd you change
to an earlier flight

23:41.583 --> 23:42.983
at the last minute?

23:44.252 --> 23:46.419
Vince called me
the night before.

23:46.487 --> 23:47.587
He'd been drinking.

23:47.654 --> 23:50.056
He said some pretty
terrible things.

23:50.124 --> 23:51.824
About the divorce?

23:51.892 --> 23:54.561
I wasn't gonna let
him, not without a fight.

23:54.628 --> 23:57.663
I went looking for him
when I arrived.

23:57.731 --> 23:59.232
I went to set, but I saw him...

23:59.300 --> 24:01.534
Arguing with the director
right before the scene.

24:01.602 --> 24:03.335
Do you know what
they were arguing about?

24:05.271 --> 24:06.805
You've gotta do
at least one stunt!

24:06.872 --> 24:08.140
If you do it,

24:08.208 --> 24:09.674
you're the one to scare her
in the house!

24:09.742 --> 24:11.042
Aw, forget it!

24:11.111 --> 24:13.312
Zack, do not
walk away from me!

24:13.379 --> 24:15.581
I don't really
know, but it was heated

24:15.648 --> 24:17.849
and I wasn't gonna get
in the middle of it.

24:17.917 --> 24:20.118
I went to his trailer.

24:20.185 --> 24:21.319
Between the traveling

24:21.386 --> 24:23.588
and all my emotions
swirling around,

24:23.655 --> 24:24.755
I passed out.

24:26.525 --> 24:29.960
When I woke up,
I didn't even know where I was.

24:32.664 --> 24:37.834
I went to set to look for Vince
and... that's when I heard.

24:42.673 --> 24:45.708
I can't believe he's gone.

24:50.313 --> 24:51.580
So we have an I.D.
on the individual

24:51.648 --> 24:53.215
who was sending Vince
those death threats.

24:53.283 --> 24:55.684
His name's Ryan Shaw.
Turns out he's a known stalker.

24:55.752 --> 24:56.852
Okay, great,
let's bring him in.

24:56.919 --> 24:58.086
No need.

24:58.155 --> 24:59.888
He got picked up
for aggravated assault.

24:59.956 --> 25:02.158
He is currently doing
5 years in Kingston.

25:02.225 --> 25:03.392
Oh, okay.

25:03.460 --> 25:06.927
We are back to our
"Death Manor" crew.

25:06.995 --> 25:09.597
No one from the outside world
had access to the set,

25:09.665 --> 25:11.699
so our killer is
one of these people.

25:11.767 --> 25:14.202
Vince backed out of that
restaurant deal with Angela.

25:14.270 --> 25:16.070
She's got motive.

25:16.138 --> 25:17.205
Rachel, the widow,
she stood to lose a lot

25:17.273 --> 25:18.439
in the divorce.

25:18.507 --> 25:19.574
No, I don't see her
as a killer.

25:19.642 --> 25:21.976
I was reading her.
She's hurting.

25:22.044 --> 25:24.578
Maybe it's guilt.

25:24.646 --> 25:26.480
Rachel saw Vince
and Zack fighting.

25:26.548 --> 25:27.981
I mean, they were really
going at it.

25:28.049 --> 25:29.983
You know, guys, if
this was a horror film,

25:30.051 --> 25:31.918
the killer would be the person
we least expect.

25:31.986 --> 25:34.754
The hair and makeup lady
with the crazy cat posters

25:34.822 --> 25:35.922
all over her trailer.

25:35.990 --> 25:38.224
Even more unexpected.

25:44.064 --> 25:46.299
Okay, look, we
have multiple suspects.

25:46.366 --> 25:48.801
We have two guns
and we have one dead body.

25:48.868 --> 25:50.736
One avenue that we have not
looked at yet

25:50.804 --> 25:52.871
is Death Manor itself.

25:52.939 --> 25:55.173
I mean, if we can get a handle
on the geography,

25:55.241 --> 25:57.409
maybe we can figure out
how the killer pulled this off.

25:57.476 --> 25:58.643
Can we get the blueprints?

25:58.711 --> 26:00.812
I tried. I had no luck,
but I did, however,

26:00.879 --> 26:03.381
uncover some of the more
macabre details

26:03.449 --> 26:04.549
about Death Manor.

26:04.617 --> 26:06.551
There were two previous deaths.

26:06.619 --> 26:09.053
A builder was crushed
by a falling beam

26:09.121 --> 26:11.088
during construction
of the manor in 1907,

26:11.155 --> 26:13.324
and one of its previous owners

26:13.391 --> 26:15.826
Was killed in a kitchen fire
in the late '50s.

26:15.893 --> 26:18.061
Okay, is this going somewhere?

26:18.129 --> 26:19.363
I'm just saying
I think that we need

26:19.431 --> 26:21.765
to keep our minds open
to the possibilities.

26:21.833 --> 26:24.635
No, no, no, do not say it.

26:24.703 --> 26:26.203
"The Curse of Death
Manor."

26:27.137 --> 26:29.405
So when The Blood Butcher
flings open the door, Nikki,

26:29.473 --> 26:31.006
you're going crazy with fear.

26:31.074 --> 26:33.075
You know that you have this
one last chance to survive.

26:33.143 --> 26:34.910
So you grab the jar of lye

26:34.978 --> 26:37.413
and you throw it in his face
like this!

26:37.481 --> 26:39.982
And Rick, you start clawing
at your face and your eyes,

26:40.050 --> 26:42.284
but nothing can stop you.
You're The Blood Butcher.

26:42.352 --> 26:45.019
So you're already turning back
towards her as...

26:45.087 --> 26:47.055
You rush past him,
right out of frame, okay?

26:47.123 --> 26:49.224
Just remember to keep
your injured hand by your side

26:49.292 --> 26:51.826
so that we don't pick it up
on camera, okay?

26:51.894 --> 26:52.894
Yeah, I've got it.

26:52.962 --> 26:53.895
No problem.

26:53.963 --> 26:55.564
All right, okay.

26:55.632 --> 26:58.532
Let's try one, guys.
Finals!

26:58.600 --> 26:59.600
Finals,
everybody, let's go!

26:59.668 --> 27:00.834
You have a minute?

27:00.902 --> 27:02.202
This is not a good time, guys.

27:02.271 --> 27:03.738
It's a rhetorical
question, Zack.

27:03.805 --> 27:05.439
We need to talk to you.

27:06.742 --> 27:08.643
Five minutes, everybody.

27:08.710 --> 27:11.111
Were you and Vince
having problems?

27:11.179 --> 27:12.713
I'm the guy the studio
took a chance on.

27:12.781 --> 27:14.347
I can't afford to piss off
my star.

27:14.415 --> 27:16.215
That would be career suicide.

27:16.284 --> 27:18.285
Well, we have a witness
who saw you two fighting

27:18.352 --> 27:19.552
on the set.

27:19.620 --> 27:21.454
Uh, what?
Yeah, hold on a second.

27:21.522 --> 27:22.722
I did have an argument
with somebody,

27:22.790 --> 27:24.223
but it wasn't Vince.

27:24.292 --> 27:25.725
It was Rick in a costume.

27:25.793 --> 27:26.959
That's right.

27:27.027 --> 27:28.027
That's what the argument
was about.

27:28.095 --> 27:28.928
Vince insisted on doing
the stunt

27:28.996 --> 27:30.029
and Rick didn't want him to.

27:30.097 --> 27:31.229
Had that happened before?

27:31.298 --> 27:32.631
Never.

27:32.699 --> 27:34.767
Vince came to me three hours
before with the idea.

27:34.834 --> 27:36.902
He said he wanted to take off
his mask during the shot

27:36.969 --> 27:38.369
and show his fans
that it was him.

27:38.437 --> 27:39.971
How did you feel about that?

27:40.039 --> 27:41.940
I loved it.
That's why I fought for it.

27:42.008 --> 27:43.408
The fans would've loved it.

27:43.475 --> 27:44.810
So why was Rick upset?

27:44.877 --> 27:46.978
I don't know.
Guys, you just...

27:47.046 --> 27:48.579
Go ask him, okay?

27:48.647 --> 27:50.381
Look, I'm losing
the light here.

27:51.617 --> 27:53.351
Okay, we're back, people!

28:05.396 --> 28:07.865
Oh! Oh geez! Mmm! Ah!

28:12.069 --> 28:14.237
Agh! Agh! Oh! Agh!

28:14.305 --> 28:15.205
Oh!

28:23.981 --> 28:25.315
Hey, just a sec.

28:25.382 --> 28:26.514
- Yeah.
- What's going on?

28:26.582 --> 28:28.250
I don't think
I can live with her, man.

28:28.318 --> 28:30.618
You guys have been living
together for like - what?

28:30.686 --> 28:32.020
No, not Sandy, okay?

28:32.088 --> 28:34.723
She brought her dead Nana's
ashes and a portrait

28:34.790 --> 28:36.859
that has been giving me
the evil eye all day, okay?

28:36.926 --> 28:38.693
I thought I could handle this
living together thing,

28:38.761 --> 28:40.495
but I am not ready
for this at all.

28:40.563 --> 28:42.964
Get professional advice, okay?

28:43.031 --> 28:44.198
Yeah, that's real funny,
funny guy.

28:44.266 --> 28:45.766
You know what?
We'll see who's laughing

28:45.834 --> 28:47.801
when I leave the place to Sandy
and her Nana painting

28:47.870 --> 28:49.103
and I come move in with you.

28:49.171 --> 28:50.922
Look, I gotta get going here,
all right?

28:51.042 --> 28:53.241
We'll talk later.

28:56.144 --> 28:57.311
You wanted to see me?

28:57.379 --> 28:59.179
- Wow.
- Yeah.

28:59.247 --> 29:02.749
We understand that you and
Zack had an argument yesterday?

29:02.816 --> 29:04.918
We had a difference
of opinion, yeah.

29:04.986 --> 29:06.786
Well, we heard it was a
little more heated than that, Rick.

29:06.854 --> 29:08.721
What happened?

29:08.789 --> 29:11.057
Look, Vince counted
on me to protect him,

29:11.125 --> 29:12.759
even from himself.

29:12.826 --> 29:14.427
I was just doin' my job.

29:14.495 --> 29:15.628
Did you think that this stunt

29:15.696 --> 29:17.630
was too dangerous
for him to do?

29:17.698 --> 29:19.131
Maybe he could've
handled it back in the day,

29:19.199 --> 29:22.334
but that was a long time ago.

29:22.403 --> 29:25.905
Look, I was afraid
he was gonna get hurt.

29:25.972 --> 29:28.040
Looks like I was right.

29:28.108 --> 29:32.243
I should've stopped him.
He was in no shape to work.

29:32.311 --> 29:33.177
What kind of
condition was he in

29:33.245 --> 29:34.780
before the scene?

29:34.847 --> 29:35.847
Look, I've been working
with Vince

29:35.915 --> 29:37.248
my whole career, all right?

29:37.316 --> 29:39.418
We were like twins.

29:39.485 --> 29:41.185
Go on.

29:41.253 --> 29:42.987
Well, he said he had
a buzz on per usual,

29:43.055 --> 29:45.557
but he was pretty drunk.

29:45.625 --> 29:48.559
I know I'm alive
because he did the scene.

29:48.627 --> 29:51.929
I shouldn't complain,
it's just that...

29:51.996 --> 29:54.865
It feels like
I should've stopped him.

29:54.933 --> 29:56.333
Well, do you think
him being drunk

29:56.401 --> 29:58.669
influenced his decision
to do the stunt himself?

30:00.038 --> 30:01.071
It clouded his judgment,

30:01.139 --> 30:02.872
but the decision
to do the stunt,

30:02.940 --> 30:05.007
that didn't come from Vince.

30:05.075 --> 30:06.443
Who'd it come from?

30:07.578 --> 30:09.278
The prop master, Gary.

30:09.346 --> 30:11.548
Gary had a beef with Vince
the night before the shoot.

30:15.753 --> 30:17.086
Great!

30:17.154 --> 30:18.454
What? You got all night.
Make another one.

30:18.521 --> 30:20.656
Yeah, thanks a lot.

30:21.791 --> 30:23.959
I guess he wanted
to get back at Vince.

30:25.428 --> 30:26.662
Gotta get this to Rick.

30:26.729 --> 30:27.696
It's gonna be one hell
of a scene.

30:27.764 --> 30:28.997
Do you think the audience
will know

30:29.065 --> 30:30.265
that he's in the movie
more than you are?

30:32.335 --> 30:36.170
Actors are pretty insecure
and Vince was a fading star.

30:37.773 --> 30:39.173
He was easy to mess with.

30:39.240 --> 30:41.609
Gary must have really
disliked him.

30:41.677 --> 30:44.879
Emotions run pretty hot
on a film set.

30:46.147 --> 30:49.784
I just keep thinking about
how I should've stopped him,

30:49.852 --> 30:50.884
and then I think
what could've happened

30:50.952 --> 30:51.985
if I did.

30:53.788 --> 30:55.021
Look, anything you guys need

30:55.089 --> 30:56.990
to help catch this guy
that did it...

30:57.057 --> 30:59.092
Thank you.
We'll let you know.

30:59.159 --> 31:01.194
We'll get this guy.

31:11.404 --> 31:13.071
Gary?

31:13.139 --> 31:15.107
Hey, Gary!

31:25.551 --> 31:26.584
Michelle.

31:28.821 --> 31:29.921
Look at this.

31:38.664 --> 31:41.499
Fake rounds.
This is the prop gun.

31:47.772 --> 31:49.006
That's not fake blood.

31:57.915 --> 31:59.049
Gary!

32:01.885 --> 32:02.952
Michelle!

32:04.988 --> 32:07.524
Look at me, look at me.
I'm gonna call this in.

32:18.591 --> 32:20.256
Well, he's lost a lot of blood,

32:20.324 --> 32:21.992
but good thing you found him
when you did.

32:22.059 --> 32:23.159
You saved his life.

32:23.227 --> 32:24.427
When can I talk to him?

32:24.496 --> 32:27.230
Not tonight.
He is heavily sedated.

32:27.298 --> 32:28.298
All right.

32:28.366 --> 32:29.399
You mind if I stay around
awhile?

32:29.467 --> 32:30.400
Of course.

32:30.468 --> 32:31.668
My shift's ending

32:31.736 --> 32:32.603
but I'll let
the on-call nurse know.

32:32.670 --> 32:33.770
Thanks, Sandy.

32:38.141 --> 32:39.274
Gary.

32:42.245 --> 32:43.245
Can you hear me?

32:45.616 --> 32:48.584
I want you to think
about the attack.

32:48.652 --> 32:50.720
What happened to you?

32:52.755 --> 32:54.055
You better have my money,

32:54.123 --> 32:56.224
or do I have to tell the cops
what I found?

32:59.896 --> 33:01.462
Hey, I just
spoke to the surgeon.

33:01.531 --> 33:04.032
He was sliced with a large,
heavy blade.

33:04.099 --> 33:06.568
Yeah, I just saw the attack.
It was a cleaver,

33:06.636 --> 33:08.502
and whoever attacked him

33:08.570 --> 33:10.404
was wearing
The Blood Butcher outfit,

33:10.471 --> 33:12.372
so I won't be able
to I.D. him.

33:12.440 --> 33:14.174
Okay, so what's the motive?

33:14.242 --> 33:15.743
I think Gary might've
been blackmailing

33:15.810 --> 33:17.878
whoever attacked him.

33:17.946 --> 33:19.613
We need to find out who attacked
him,

33:19.681 --> 33:22.650
and we need to find
that cleaver.

33:24.084 --> 33:25.752
Dev, what's going on?

33:25.819 --> 33:27.654
I just got the forensics
report on the prop gun.

33:27.721 --> 33:29.388
The stuntman, Rick,
his prints are all over it.

33:29.456 --> 33:30.557
Okay, let's bring him in.

33:30.624 --> 33:31.824
Yeah, about that,

33:31.892 --> 33:32.458
according to
the production coordinator,

33:32.526 --> 33:33.860
Rick is AWOL.

33:33.928 --> 33:34.928
Do we have an address?

33:34.995 --> 33:36.395
Not exactly.

33:36.463 --> 33:37.730
They pay him a living allowance
like everyone else,

33:37.798 --> 33:39.565
but apparently Rick likes
to just pocket the cash

33:39.632 --> 33:40.832
and sleep wherever on set.

33:40.900 --> 33:42.701
So I guess we're going back
to Death Manor.

33:53.112 --> 33:54.512
Oz?!

33:54.581 --> 33:55.513
Hey!

33:55.581 --> 33:56.814
Care to explain this?

33:56.882 --> 33:58.549
The blanket?

33:58.617 --> 33:59.884
Come here.

33:59.952 --> 34:01.586
What?

34:01.653 --> 34:02.954
Just come
over here for second.

34:03.021 --> 34:04.521
Seriously,
what is your problem?

34:04.590 --> 34:05.590
Nothing! No, it's not
problem at all, listen.

34:05.657 --> 34:06.791
What is that painting
doing here, okay?

34:06.858 --> 34:08.125
I mean, did you put it there
just to remind me

34:08.193 --> 34:09.627
that your family's constantly
watching me from afar,

34:09.695 --> 34:11.195
- judging me?
- Are you trying to get rid of me?

34:11.262 --> 34:12.228
Is that what this is?

34:12.295 --> 34:13.663
This, this, this was a mistake.

34:13.731 --> 34:15.398
No, no, no, no, no!
I love having you here.

34:15.466 --> 34:18.534
It's just that...
three is a crowd.

34:20.437 --> 34:22.405
Okay, I...

34:22.473 --> 34:24.407
You know what?
I get it.

34:24.475 --> 34:28.143
It wasn't fair of me
to spring this on you.

34:29.079 --> 34:30.312
To be honest,
it kinda creeps me out too.

34:30.379 --> 34:31.480
Right?

34:31.547 --> 34:32.481
What happened to your finger?

34:32.547 --> 34:33.916
Oh, nothing.

34:33.984 --> 34:35.181
What was I supposed to do?
Tell my mom no,

34:35.250 --> 34:36.350
I didn't want her around?

34:36.418 --> 34:37.952
Of course not.
Hey, come here.

34:38.020 --> 34:39.786
It's okay, it's okay.

34:39.855 --> 34:41.723
Look, maybe Nana
and I just got off

34:41.790 --> 34:43.190
on the wrong foot, okay?

34:43.257 --> 34:46.127
I could win her over.
I won you over.

34:46.194 --> 34:49.163
- Yeah, you did.
- Yeah, I did?

34:49.231 --> 34:51.331
- Did I win you over?
- You did win me over.

34:57.839 --> 34:59.806
- Mmm, mmm-mmm, you know what?
- What?

34:59.874 --> 35:00.974
We should probably put
the blanket back on

35:01.042 --> 35:02.109
for this part.

35:03.811 --> 35:05.646
You know what?
I got a better idea.

35:18.125 --> 35:21.426
Wow, it looks
like a ghost town.

35:21.494 --> 35:25.096
This place is even
creepier with no people around.

35:25.164 --> 35:26.798
Backup should be here
any minute.

35:26.866 --> 35:28.033
I'm gonna go look for Rick.

35:28.100 --> 35:29.200
I'll meet you
in the parlour set.

35:29.268 --> 35:30.468
Whoa! No, no, no,

35:30.536 --> 35:32.503
Dev would probably have
something to say

35:32.571 --> 35:34.839
about us splitting up
with a killer on the loose.

35:34.907 --> 35:36.541
Well, I've seen
enough horror films to know

35:36.608 --> 35:39.576
that the heroine
always survives.

35:39.644 --> 35:40.811
The sidekick however...

35:40.879 --> 35:42.713
Sidekick?

37:02.922 --> 37:04.890
- Hey.
- Hey, it's me.

37:04.958 --> 37:06.458
Found the costume
that Rick was wearing

37:06.525 --> 37:09.161
when he attacked the props guy.

37:09.229 --> 37:10.896
There's blood
on the boots here.

37:10.964 --> 37:12.197
It's real.

37:12.265 --> 37:13.598
Okay. We might have our guy.

37:13.666 --> 37:15.166
I'm in the parlour
looking for the real cleaver.

37:15.234 --> 37:16.934
So far I've just found
the prop.

37:17.002 --> 37:19.403
Okay, well, be careful,
and keep in contact with me.

37:19.471 --> 37:21.939
Copy that.
I'll keep you updated.

37:35.353 --> 37:37.254
- Logan.
- Zack.

37:37.322 --> 37:38.922
What're you doing here?

37:38.990 --> 37:40.991
I gotta work out my shots.
I still got a movie to finish.

37:41.926 --> 37:44.127
The sets locked down.
How'd you get in?

37:44.195 --> 37:46.062
There's an old service tunnel
down in the basement.

37:46.130 --> 37:48.045
Lock's been rusted off the doors
for years.

37:48.165 --> 37:49.532
Well, you know your way around.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.967
I know everything
about this place.

38:00.277 --> 38:01.778
I immersed myself
in its history.

38:01.845 --> 38:03.612
You know, that's what all
the great directors do.

38:03.680 --> 38:06.348
They believe in preparation
and research.

38:06.416 --> 38:08.183
What's in the backpack?

38:08.250 --> 38:10.979
Oh, scripts.

38:12.789 --> 38:13.955
Story boards.

38:16.192 --> 38:17.892
- Whatever.
- No, you're lying, man.

38:17.960 --> 38:19.428
You've been lying
the whole time.

38:19.495 --> 38:21.095
You're the only one
who has access to everything.

38:21.163 --> 38:22.596
You stole Vince's gun,

38:22.664 --> 38:25.233
then you switched it out
with the prop gun.

38:27.236 --> 38:28.536
You're making a mistake, Logan.

38:28.603 --> 38:30.671
Come on, man,
we both know you did it.

38:30.739 --> 38:31.906
No.

38:33.575 --> 38:35.310
You're mistake
was coming alone.

38:44.219 --> 38:45.252
Dev?

38:45.320 --> 38:46.987
We have Rick in custody.
Get this:

38:47.055 --> 38:50.224
We found him pounding shots
at a bar two blocks from set.

38:50.291 --> 38:52.559
Brave man or just stupid.

38:52.626 --> 38:54.927
Okay, I'll get Toby
and we'll head back in.

39:01.068 --> 39:02.134
Michelle!

39:05.105 --> 39:06.706
Hey, it's Toby.
Leave your name and number

39:06.774 --> 39:09.274
and I'll get back to you.

39:13.446 --> 39:14.446
Oh!

39:45.923 --> 39:47.656
Well, we could do
this all night, Zack.

39:47.724 --> 39:50.226
Hey, why don't we talk about
how you killed Vince.

39:50.294 --> 39:52.361
That had to have been tough.

39:53.463 --> 39:55.831
Sorry, Logan, no spoilers.

39:55.899 --> 39:57.166
Aw, come on, man.

39:57.234 --> 39:59.401
You gotta at least tell me
why you did it.

39:59.468 --> 40:00.501
I mean, you had zero motive.

40:00.569 --> 40:02.404
I had the best motive.

40:02.471 --> 40:04.072
My movie.

40:04.140 --> 40:05.407
No offense to Vince,

40:05.474 --> 40:06.441
but his life didn't mean
anything to me.

40:06.508 --> 40:08.543
This movie means everything.

40:08.610 --> 40:11.012
I'm sorry, I don't follow you.

40:11.080 --> 40:12.713
When Vince died on set,

40:12.781 --> 40:15.015
this movie became more than
a low budget piece of fluff.

40:15.083 --> 40:17.051
It became a part of history.

40:17.953 --> 40:21.021
Okay, I get that, I get that.
And what about Gary?

40:21.089 --> 40:23.690
Gary's an idiot.
He brought it on himself.

40:25.893 --> 40:27.828
Hey, is that
what I think it is?

40:27.895 --> 40:29.063
I can explain.

40:29.130 --> 40:30.197
Yeah, well you better talk fast.

40:30.265 --> 40:31.564
He knew what you were doing.

40:31.631 --> 40:33.499
He blackmailed you,
so you tried to kill him.

40:33.567 --> 40:35.468
It was just one more mess
to clean up.

40:35.535 --> 40:38.371
That makes sense.
You pinned it on Rick.

40:40.207 --> 40:42.375
I figured you guys
were looking at him already,

40:42.443 --> 40:43.876
so who better than Rick
to take the fall?

40:43.944 --> 40:46.745
I mean, that's his specialty,
right?

40:51.284 --> 40:53.251
Drop it!

40:53.319 --> 40:54.519
Or I drop you!

41:00.960 --> 41:02.627
Turn around, Zack.

41:10.869 --> 41:12.970
Do you want the
good news or the bad news?

41:13.038 --> 41:14.671
Good.

41:14.739 --> 41:16.673
I called St. Luke's,
Gary's gonna pull through.

41:16.741 --> 41:18.709
The bad news is the judge
ordered a psych eval

41:18.776 --> 41:20.043
on our director.

41:20.111 --> 41:21.177
I think he's heading
for the psych ward

41:21.245 --> 41:22.445
instead of prison.

41:22.513 --> 41:24.647
I wonder if they'll have
movie night?

41:24.715 --> 41:25.915
You know what really
gets me about all this though?

41:25.983 --> 41:27.717
I have no doubt this movie
will be released

41:27.784 --> 41:29.886
and probably do big business
on the back of this.

41:29.953 --> 41:31.087
Well, I'm not gonna lie to you.

41:31.155 --> 41:32.688
I'll be first in line
to see it.

41:32.756 --> 41:34.991
That was closer
than I woulda liked.

41:35.058 --> 41:37.326
I don't want to get caught
flat-footed again.

41:37.394 --> 41:38.894
You wanna carry a weapon?

41:38.961 --> 41:41.763
I mean, there's only so much
I can do without one.

41:41.831 --> 41:44.198
I'd at least like to have
the conversation.

41:46.736 --> 41:48.136
It'll take a lot to get
you trained up

41:48.203 --> 41:49.370
to carry a weapon.

41:49.438 --> 41:51.940
Yeah, I'm up for it.
Bring it on.

41:52.008 --> 41:53.875
I'll get the
wheels in motion.

41:59.920 --> 42:01.181
You survived.

42:01.249 --> 42:04.484
Yeah, barely.
Uh, so how's the case?

42:04.553 --> 42:05.853
You know, it's over, man.

42:05.921 --> 42:07.821
I'm gonna grab a hot shower
and a cold beer.

42:07.889 --> 42:09.089
Wait, you're at your apartment?

42:09.157 --> 42:11.124
Yeah, I just walked in.

42:11.192 --> 42:14.727
Toby, there's something I gotta
tell you about Sandy's Nana.

42:14.795 --> 42:16.596
What is this in my kitchen?

42:16.664 --> 42:18.565
So you've seen it already?

42:18.632 --> 42:19.933
I'm sorry.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.467
You know, you said
it wasn't such a big deal

42:21.535 --> 42:24.336
so I thought maybe you could
babysit her for the night.

42:24.404 --> 42:25.838
One night, that's it.

42:25.906 --> 42:27.339
Thank you. I owe you big.

42:27.407 --> 42:29.042
And, hey, anytime you need
to store cremated ashes

42:29.109 --> 42:30.442
or the spooky portrait

42:30.509 --> 42:31.777
of some long-dead relative
at my house,

42:31.844 --> 42:33.244
be my guest.

42:33.312 --> 42:35.714
All right, all right,
let's chat tomorrow, okay?

42:38.284 --> 42:40.884
Good night, Nana.
