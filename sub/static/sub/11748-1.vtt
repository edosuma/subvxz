<i>The music is always there,
burning inside me.</i>

01:36.118 --> 01:38.584
<i>I don't know where it comes from.</i>

01:40.985 --> 01:43.952
<i>I only know that
if it stays trapped within...</i>

01:45.152 --> 01:47.415
<i>I will be consumed.</i>

02:21.952 --> 02:24.885
<i>I can't remember when I started dancing.</i>

02:25.052 --> 02:27.951
<i>It's always just been who I am.</i>

02:30.118 --> 02:31.948
<i>Balanchine said,</i>

02:32.118 --> 02:36.108
<i>"See the music, hear the dance."</i>

02:38.052 --> 02:41.450
<i>It's my first day in New York City.</i>

02:41.618 --> 02:43.742
<i>My eyes are wide open,</i>

02:44.417 --> 02:47.217
<i>and I am ready to listen.</i>

03:13.584 --> 03:17.211
This is how you start the day, Krispy.
Let's go.

03:21.718 --> 03:23.548
Breakfast going to be good today, Rik.

03:25.451 --> 03:26.645
Come on, let's go, let's go!

03:29.985 --> 03:31.383
Yo! What's up?

03:31.551 --> 03:32.643
Hey, what's up?

04:29.718 --> 04:31.378
Hey!

04:35.085 --> 04:37.313
Hey! Let's go!

04:40.318 --> 04:41.217
Come on, come on.

04:57.818 --> 04:59.580
Check out the new step, Rik.

05:09.217 --> 05:10.707
Don't slow up on me now.

05:12.551 --> 05:13.449
Hit it!

05:13.618 --> 05:16.779
All right. Yeah!

05:16.952 --> 05:18.316
Drop it. Drop it.

05:19.584 --> 05:20.573
Hey!

05:24.085 --> 05:25.244
Huh!

05:26.818 --> 05:29.546
Go! Let him fly.

05:32.418 --> 05:33.976
There it is.

05:34.152 --> 05:35.880
Come on. We're gonna be late.

05:36.052 --> 05:38.575
Oh, we're going left up here,
to the dance department.

05:40.584 --> 05:42.744
- Can you wait just a sec?
- Sure.

05:45.551 --> 05:47.984
So, honey, here we are.

05:48.152 --> 05:50.744
Everything that you've always wanted.

05:50.918 --> 05:52.407
Thank you for making this happen.

05:52.584 --> 05:54.380
You made it happen.

05:54.551 --> 05:59.543
Just make sure that you call me if you need
anything at all, or even just to talk.

05:59.718 --> 06:02.241
- I will. I will.
- Okay.

06:06.251 --> 06:08.116
Oh, Mom!

06:10.251 --> 06:13.117
- Call me.
- I promise.

06:13.284 --> 06:15.615
I'll be fine. I'll be fine.

06:15.785 --> 06:19.309
I know you will.
It's just me I'm worried about.

06:24.918 --> 06:27.316
I love you. That's all I'm gonna say.

06:28.985 --> 06:30.144
I love you too.

06:32.985 --> 06:34.542
Bye.

07:13.985 --> 07:16.645
Oh! I'm sorry. I was just...

07:17.885 --> 07:20.249
admiring here.

07:37.651 --> 07:40.311
- Ruby?
- I'm sorry.

07:40.484 --> 07:42.314
She's beautiful.

07:43.718 --> 07:46.049
Alexandra Danilova.

07:46.217 --> 07:47.878
One of our greatest.

07:48.718 --> 07:52.276
So, we have placed you in division C2.

07:52.451 --> 07:57.044
The dress code is mandatory for all classes
except contemporary.

07:57.217 --> 08:01.082
And we do not tolerate tardiness, ever.

08:02.952 --> 08:06.544
So your first class
starts tomorrow at 9:00 a.m.

08:06.718 --> 08:08.309
Yes, ma'am.

08:09.618 --> 08:12.312
- Madame Markova.
- Madame Markova.

08:13.384 --> 08:14.908
Any questions?

08:15.084 --> 08:18.711
If there isn't a dress code for
the contemporary class, what do we wear?

08:21.985 --> 08:24.474
Use your imagination.

08:25.217 --> 08:27.980
All right, then. Good luck.

08:28.151 --> 08:30.084
Thank you.

08:36.551 --> 08:37.745
What are you doing?

08:37.918 --> 08:40.908
- I'm so sorry.
- Forget it.

08:41.083 --> 08:43.711
Just watch where you're going next time.

10:26.151 --> 10:28.141
I love your playing.

10:29.451 --> 10:32.117
You're welcome.

10:36.651 --> 10:38.584
- Ruby?
- Yep. You must be Jasmine.

10:38.751 --> 10:41.650
Yeah, but everyone calls me Jazzy,
except my parents.

10:41.818 --> 10:43.375
- Okay.
- Come on in.

10:44.551 --> 10:46.881
You know, you don't have
to ring the doorbell.

10:47.017 --> 10:48.780
- You live here.
- Oh, right.

10:48.951 --> 10:52.544
I figured this was my bed,
so I just put my stuff on here.

10:52.685 --> 10:56.118
Yeah, that's perfect.
You here on scholarship?

10:56.284 --> 10:58.148
- Yeah.
- Me too. It's my second year.

10:58.318 --> 11:01.114
Hey, how did it go with Markova?

11:01.284 --> 11:02.649
Great.

11:02.818 --> 11:05.148
Really? Someone must have dislodged

11:05.318 --> 11:09.376
the broomstick up her butt,
because normally she is an uptight witch.

11:09.518 --> 11:11.950
Actually, I'm pretty sure
the broom is still there.

11:14.117 --> 11:16.084
This is cute. You should wear this tonight.

11:16.251 --> 11:18.775
- Where are we going?
- We're going out.

11:18.951 --> 11:20.748
But we have class tomorrow morning.

11:20.917 --> 11:25.408
Yeah, and this is your first night living
on your own in New York City!

11:25.584 --> 11:27.710
- We are so going out.
- No, we're not.

11:27.884 --> 11:29.715
- Yes, we are!
- No!

11:29.884 --> 11:31.408
Yes!

11:43.284 --> 11:45.910
I got the red line drafted. That's right.

11:46.584 --> 11:48.141
- Hey.
- I'm waiting for the counter.

11:49.284 --> 11:52.046
Okay. Okay, I'll call you back.

11:52.217 --> 11:53.877
- Hey, hey, Johnnie.
- Hi.

11:54.051 --> 11:55.450
- How you doing?
- Yeah, not bad.

11:55.618 --> 11:57.551
- You want something to drink?
- No, I'm good, mate.

11:57.718 --> 11:59.207
- You sure? All right.
- Yeah.

12:00.284 --> 12:01.841
Here you go.

12:06.518 --> 12:08.984
- It's all there.
- Great.

12:11.117 --> 12:13.482
So, when do you think you'll have it by?

12:13.651 --> 12:17.209
Soon. Don't worry. I'll file the papers
as soon as I get back to the office.

12:17.384 --> 12:19.544
I'll call you by the end of the week.
Should have an update then.

12:19.718 --> 12:22.583
Great. I mean,
thank you for handling all this.

12:23.984 --> 12:25.814
I guess I'll see you.

12:30.217 --> 12:33.175
- I'll be waiting for your call.
- You got it, kid.

12:45.817 --> 12:48.011
We have a right to be here.

12:48.217 --> 12:50.774
I want to see some ID right now.

12:53.551 --> 12:55.415
Yo! Wait up.

12:57.051 --> 12:59.143
Hey, man.

12:59.318 --> 13:02.251
- You live upstairs?
- Yeah. Simon's place.

13:02.418 --> 13:04.612
Oh, that's cool.
You gotta love Inwood, right?

13:04.784 --> 13:07.274
Neighborhood's sketchy,
but the price is right.

13:07.451 --> 13:10.384
- Least it's Manhattan, right?
- Right.

13:10.551 --> 13:13.779
Oh. Hayward Jones III.

13:13.951 --> 13:16.782
- Johnnie Blackwell.
- Johnnie Blackwell.

13:16.951 --> 13:18.941
It's nice to meet you, Johnnie.

13:21.817 --> 13:24.750
Hey why don't you come meet
the rest of my crew?

13:26.051 --> 13:28.075
- That's all right, man.
- Aw, come on.

13:28.251 --> 13:31.377
Krispy just made some ugly alien octopus.
You'll like it.

13:33.117 --> 13:35.050
- Okay.
- All right.

13:35.217 --> 13:37.150
Yo, guys!

13:37.318 --> 13:38.784
Open your mind.

13:38.951 --> 13:41.646
- Who is this guy?
- Johnnie B. Lives upstairs.

13:42.551 --> 13:43.915
Calamari?

13:45.084 --> 13:47.915
And that's a little chipotle rÃ©moulade.
It's for the dip.

13:48.084 --> 13:50.574
- These are my roommates Krispy and Rik.
- Hey.

13:52.651 --> 13:55.981
Is that you playing up there like Yo-Yo Mama?

13:56.651 --> 13:58.117
Yo-Yo plays the cello.

13:58.284 --> 13:59.875
- You play violin, right?
- Right.

14:00.051 --> 14:03.416
Oh, we know.
We hear you playing all night long.

14:04.418 --> 14:06.044
When do you sleep?

14:06.217 --> 14:09.446
Would you all leave the dude alone?
We're the Switch Steps crew.

14:11.084 --> 14:12.948
You might have heard of us.

14:13.117 --> 14:16.312
Well, I haven't been in the country
for that long, so...

14:16.484 --> 14:17.745
- Aw, man!
- Oh, no.

14:17.917 --> 14:20.282
Well, take a seat, Harry Potter,

14:21.984 --> 14:23.746
and we'll give you a little preview.

14:23.917 --> 14:26.214
- All right, guys.
- Relax.

14:28.251 --> 14:29.309
You got this, Rik.

14:29.484 --> 14:31.542
Rik is our freestyle super freak.

14:33.217 --> 14:35.411
Let's go!

14:35.584 --> 14:37.414
Go, Jett!

14:37.584 --> 14:39.812
And that redhead you see right there?
Oh, that's Jett.

14:39.984 --> 14:40.814
Go, Jett!

14:42.217 --> 14:44.411
- Let's go!
- She hits harder than most the guys.

14:47.418 --> 14:48.612
And that's Ollie.

14:49.584 --> 14:51.448
All right, Ollie, let's go.

14:54.750 --> 14:56.808
Oh, and Poptart... she's a sweetheart.

14:58.784 --> 15:01.274
She's our diva.

15:04.817 --> 15:06.909
And Krispy... he can cook,

15:07.084 --> 15:09.744
groove, and he clean.

15:11.251 --> 15:12.240
Tiptoe!

15:12.418 --> 15:15.714
- And that's my bro Tiptoe.
- Yeah!

15:15.884 --> 15:19.908
And Jaxson. Jaxson can do about everything.

15:26.551 --> 15:28.245
That's it. Get it!

15:38.984 --> 15:40.144
Yeah!

15:41.951 --> 15:43.384
Hit it, Rik! Let's do it!

15:44.617 --> 15:47.414
Blew a fuse.

15:47.583 --> 15:50.415
Yeah!

15:50.583 --> 15:51.777
Hey.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.043
Here we go.

16:09.984 --> 16:12.213
- This is so cool.
- Yeah.

16:12.384 --> 16:14.748
All the dancers hang out here.

16:14.917 --> 16:17.077
- Hey, guys!
- Hey!

16:17.251 --> 16:19.581
This is Ruby, my new roommate.

16:19.750 --> 16:21.240
- Hi! Nice to meet you.
- Hey, what's up, man?

16:21.418 --> 16:23.385
It's her first year at MCA.

16:23.550 --> 16:24.949
Come on. Let's dance.

16:25.117 --> 16:26.777
- Do you want to go?
- Okay.

17:03.951 --> 17:06.611
- Hurry!
- Coming!

17:06.784 --> 17:09.546
- Come on! I can't be late for my first day.
- Wait.

17:09.717 --> 17:13.116
This is the earliest
I've ever left the apartment.

17:14.916 --> 17:16.906
I'm already exhausted.

17:17.084 --> 17:19.074
See, now we can relax.

17:19.251 --> 17:21.480
Much less stressful, don't you think?

17:21.650 --> 17:24.277
I'd rather live on the edge of tardiness.

17:24.451 --> 17:26.609
Oh, hey, you have to hear this little guy.

17:26.784 --> 17:29.615
Yeah, that's great. You'll hear it every day.

17:33.817 --> 17:35.875
- I thought you were someone else.
- But she's glad you're not.

17:37.117 --> 17:38.414
Me, too, I guess.

17:39.583 --> 17:42.914
- Kyle, this is my new roommate Ruby.
- Hi.

17:43.617 --> 17:45.141
- First day?
- Yeah.

17:45.318 --> 17:47.114
Well, good luck.

17:47.284 --> 17:48.773
Thanks.

17:50.550 --> 17:53.211
- Bye.
- See ya.

17:54.217 --> 17:57.706
I can tell you're dying to know,
so here's his story.

17:58.784 --> 18:00.274
I'm not dying.

18:00.450 --> 18:01.940
Yes, you are.

18:02.117 --> 18:03.640
His name's Kyle Endicott.

18:04.483 --> 18:08.610
Super cute, insanely talented,
and ridiculously arrogant.

18:08.784 --> 18:11.081
Too bad he's not my type.

18:11.251 --> 18:14.150
- Seemed into you, though.
- Really?

18:26.717 --> 18:28.241
Hey, relax.

18:28.417 --> 18:29.941
I can't help it.

18:33.084 --> 18:34.778
You'll be fine.

18:36.117 --> 18:37.549
There's April.

18:41.483 --> 18:43.075
Yeah, we've met.

18:45.951 --> 18:47.713
She's perfect. I hate her.

18:50.884 --> 18:52.374
Morning.

18:52.550 --> 18:53.881
Good morning.

18:54.051 --> 18:57.643
- Is that our teacher?
- Kramrovsky.

18:57.817 --> 18:59.807
Isn't he a little frail?

18:59.984 --> 19:01.746
Ask me that after class.

19:01.917 --> 19:04.111
Yes, more, more, more!

19:05.251 --> 19:08.275
Push, push, push! I want double!

19:16.817 --> 19:18.579
With your hands, Jazzy.

19:21.251 --> 19:23.979
Why are you doing single piquÃ©s, April?

19:24.717 --> 19:27.207
Ruby, reach! More! More!

19:27.383 --> 19:29.248
More! More!

19:33.617 --> 19:35.084
He's tough.

19:35.251 --> 19:37.877
They broke both his hips
in a concentration camp.

19:38.051 --> 19:39.950
- He was just a kid.
- No, that is sloppy.

19:40.117 --> 19:43.141
That man is as tough as they come.

19:43.318 --> 19:45.251
Again. Try again.

19:47.483 --> 19:49.246
Watch your traveling.

19:51.217 --> 19:53.911
Wow, Miss Thing. You are quite the trainer.

19:54.084 --> 19:56.142
Thanks, but I think I'm going to throw up.

19:56.318 --> 19:58.807
Don't do that. Wait till after contemporary.

19:58.984 --> 20:01.951
- Oh, God!
- What? Got a cramp?

20:02.117 --> 20:05.243
No. I'm terrible at contemporary.

20:06.217 --> 20:08.877
Come on. We gotta change.

20:28.984 --> 20:30.144
- Oh! I'm sorry.
- No.

20:30.317 --> 20:31.875
- I'm so sorry.
- Ruby, what are you doing?

20:32.450 --> 20:34.213
You completely collapsed on your partner.

20:34.383 --> 20:35.907
You're gonna injure him like that.

20:36.084 --> 20:37.744
I'm sorry. I haven't had any contemporary...

20:37.917 --> 20:39.884
No excuses! Pull yourself together!

20:40.051 --> 20:43.313
Now get out there and dance!

20:49.483 --> 20:51.246
Are you okay?

20:51.417 --> 20:54.112
I can't believe I already have blisters.

20:54.283 --> 20:57.046
I'm gonna swing by the pharmacy
to get Preparation H.

20:58.051 --> 21:01.246
For my feet. It numbs the toes.

21:01.417 --> 21:03.214
I never heard that one before.

21:03.383 --> 21:05.044
Girl, you have got a lot to learn.

21:05.217 --> 21:07.150
I'm gonna go get my student ID.

21:07.317 --> 21:09.307
I'll see you at the apartment.

21:11.717 --> 21:13.241
All right, everyone, stay together.

21:18.450 --> 21:20.077
Oh, sorry.

22:07.250 --> 22:08.081
What up?

22:15.283 --> 22:18.876
- Hey, look who's here. The Village People.
- Yeah.

22:21.951 --> 22:24.281
They're on the work release.
The one in the yellow hat.

22:24.450 --> 22:26.246
- Yo, hit it, Jay.
- Gotcha.

22:30.750 --> 22:31.944
Come, on. Let's go!

24:56.750 --> 24:58.944
Hey, yo, yo, yo, check this out.
Check this out.

25:00.083 --> 25:01.641
The Werk Crew are battling the Reapers.

25:01.817 --> 25:03.807
His head's in his butt.

25:16.150 --> 25:17.048
Hey!

25:28.917 --> 25:30.543
Get off!

25:31.583 --> 25:32.982
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

25:46.450 --> 25:48.883
- Watch your bag.
- Thank you.

25:50.951 --> 25:52.542
No. No.

25:52.717 --> 25:53.911
Your violin.

25:55.550 --> 25:58.142
- Hey, on your feet!
- There's a cop. He can help you.

25:58.317 --> 25:59.807
Wait!

26:05.951 --> 26:07.974
- Why are you following me?
- Because I want to help you.

26:08.150 --> 26:09.879
Thanks, but I think you've done enough.

26:10.050 --> 26:11.540
Why won't you just go to the police?

26:11.717 --> 26:14.707
- Could you say that a little louder?
- I'm sorry.

26:14.884 --> 26:17.975
- I don't know what your story is.
- I'm screwed, that's my story.

26:18.150 --> 26:21.379
Wait. I think we should just stop
for a second and make a plan.

26:21.550 --> 26:23.982
Listen, we are not a team here.

26:25.483 --> 26:29.650
- Where's the closest place to hock a violin?
- I have no idea.

26:33.283 --> 26:35.716
Come on. I think it's a pawn shop.

26:35.884 --> 26:39.248
This is no pawn shop, lady.
It's a consignment store.

26:40.216 --> 26:42.445
I'm sorry.

26:42.617 --> 26:44.607
We're looking for a violin.

26:44.784 --> 26:46.717
No, it's a Luigi Mingazzi.

26:46.884 --> 26:49.043
It would have been brought in
no more than 15 minutes ago.

26:49.216 --> 26:50.615
- By who?
- A thief.

26:50.784 --> 26:53.046
You insinuating that
I buy hot property in here?

26:53.216 --> 26:55.149
- No, not at all.
- I think she just did.

26:55.317 --> 26:56.784
She didn't mean to.

26:56.950 --> 26:59.974
Why don't you two clowns clear out of here?

27:00.950 --> 27:04.645
Wait. Can we leave our number,
just in case someone brings it in?

27:05.417 --> 27:08.941
You're wasting your time with this guy.
He isn't gonna help us.

27:09.116 --> 27:11.912
Sometimes, people can surprise you.

27:13.283 --> 27:16.079
- Thank you.
- Yeah, I'm full of surprises.

27:18.150 --> 27:20.583
It's a really special violin, isn't it?

27:22.083 --> 27:24.573
My grandfather gave it to me.

27:24.750 --> 27:26.774
Why are you peddling down in the subway?

27:26.950 --> 27:28.383
- Busking.
- Busking.

27:28.550 --> 27:31.142
Well, I can only work for cash.

27:32.450 --> 27:34.417
Are you a tax evader?

27:34.583 --> 27:36.209
No.

27:36.383 --> 27:39.578
I am British,
and I don't have a visa to stay here.

27:39.750 --> 27:43.274
- Well, that's a relief.
- Not for me.

27:43.450 --> 27:45.747
I thought... I don't know...

27:45.916 --> 27:48.440
maybe you were some hardened criminal.

27:48.617 --> 27:53.812
No, it's just there isn't really
anything for me back in England.

27:53.983 --> 27:55.382
What about your family?

27:58.883 --> 28:01.975
Like I said, it's nothing.

28:04.916 --> 28:06.974
Can I buy you a piece of pizza?

28:07.150 --> 28:09.777
- What's your name?
- Ruby.

28:09.950 --> 28:12.917
- That's pretty.
- Thanks.

28:13.083 --> 28:16.380
My mom named me after the Balanchine Ballet.

28:16.550 --> 28:19.745
So, you're a dancer?

28:19.916 --> 28:21.247
Yep.

28:23.250 --> 28:25.080
I'm Johnnie.

28:25.250 --> 28:27.308
Nice to meet you.

28:37.816 --> 28:38.908
I'm home!

28:39.083 --> 28:40.982
Is that my delinquent roommate?

28:41.150 --> 28:42.117
Yes.

28:43.450 --> 28:44.973
What is that smell?

28:45.150 --> 28:47.617
Oh, I cremated my pointe shoes.

28:49.550 --> 28:50.982
I see.

28:53.650 --> 28:55.742
It worked. They're as hard as a rock.

28:55.916 --> 28:57.474
Where have you been?

28:59.717 --> 29:02.115
- I had a bit of an adventure.
- Without me?

29:02.283 --> 29:04.977
Sit. I want details.

29:08.617 --> 29:10.879
I met this guy

29:11.050 --> 29:13.881
in a weird, weird incident.

29:14.883 --> 29:17.043
And he's moody

29:17.216 --> 29:20.808
and edgy and eccentric.

29:20.983 --> 29:23.814
What does he look like?

29:23.983 --> 29:26.041
I don't know how to describe him, actually.

29:26.216 --> 29:27.876
Well, is he cute?

29:30.617 --> 29:32.379
He's more like fierce sexy.

29:34.650 --> 29:35.980
I love the sound of that.

29:36.150 --> 29:37.776
- Did you get his number?
- Yeah.

29:37.950 --> 29:40.315
- Where does he live?
- Uptown.

29:40.483 --> 29:42.541
I think he said Inwood.

29:45.150 --> 29:48.140
Ruby, that's atrocious.

29:48.317 --> 29:50.716
Jason, wait till you're behind the music.

29:54.749 --> 29:57.444
- How are you doing?
- I've never had anything like this before.

29:57.617 --> 29:59.776
- It's like G.I. Joe Jazz.
- Hang in there.

29:59.950 --> 30:02.577
Next.

30:02.749 --> 30:05.615
Shaun, what's going on back there?
You're late.

30:07.783 --> 30:09.216
Good, April.

30:11.550 --> 30:13.642
That slide needs to be bigger.

30:15.483 --> 30:16.915
And up!

30:19.716 --> 30:23.979
Great roll. I like this.
Hit that line, ladies!

30:26.083 --> 30:28.312
That'll do. Next.

30:30.450 --> 30:32.542
How do you pick up
those combinations so fast?

30:32.716 --> 30:34.047
I know.

30:34.216 --> 30:36.149
Ruby, can I see you, please?

30:39.116 --> 30:41.276
I know you're trying to get
a handle on my style.

30:41.450 --> 30:43.417
But without contemporary,
you can't be competitive

30:43.583 --> 30:45.776
in the professional world,
and that just won't fly with this school.

30:45.950 --> 30:49.980
I understand that, and believe me, I am
willing to do whatever it takes to catch up.

30:50.150 --> 30:53.208
- I promise.
- Well, I want to see it next class.

30:56.583 --> 30:59.049
A bit tough on Ruby, don't you think?

30:59.216 --> 31:02.979
- It's because she's so talented.
- Interesting technique.

31:03.150 --> 31:06.481
Well, don't you have 32 fouettÃ©s
to unleash on your next class?

31:11.383 --> 31:14.214
Hey, Neil, it's Johnnie Blackwell here.

31:14.383 --> 31:17.781
I've left you a ton of messages, and I
haven't heard anything back from you.

31:17.950 --> 31:21.543
Got my cash,
and I really need that green card.

31:22.317 --> 31:24.307
Call me, please.

31:50.050 --> 31:52.710
- Hey. Whoa. What are you doing?
- Going to see my lawyer.

31:52.883 --> 31:54.975
You gotta sign in here first.

31:55.150 --> 31:56.549
Who do you want to see?

31:56.716 --> 31:59.615
Neil Tamlen.
From Tamlen and Ginsburg Law Firm.

31:59.783 --> 32:02.216
- You got the wrong building, buddy.
- I don't think so.

32:06.383 --> 32:10.278
That's our address, but there's never been
a Ginsburg and Tamlen in this building.

32:10.450 --> 32:12.212
At least not for the last 15 years
I've worked here.

32:12.383 --> 32:15.407
That's impossible.
It's an immigration law firm.

32:15.583 --> 32:17.140
I've been a client of Neil's
for the last three months.

32:17.317 --> 32:19.307
And you've been up to this guy's office,
in this building?

32:19.483 --> 32:22.450
No. I always met him outside the office.

32:23.816 --> 32:26.942
Sorry, kid. Card's a fake.

32:54.916 --> 32:57.440
Fat free. Sugar. Carbs.

32:57.616 --> 32:59.776
Fat free. Fat free.

33:01.216 --> 33:04.308
Look, there's chocolate with peanut butter.

33:04.483 --> 33:07.972
Are you going to buy something
or just talk to the machine?

33:08.150 --> 33:10.140
Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead.

33:10.317 --> 33:11.943
Thank you.

33:16.916 --> 33:19.042
Fat free. Always.

33:20.582 --> 33:23.209
- Hey, pretty girl.
- Hey, Kyle.

33:26.616 --> 33:29.482
There you go. One loaner violin bow.

33:29.649 --> 33:32.980
- You break it, you buy it.
- This the best you've got?

33:36.549 --> 33:38.573
Hey. Ruby, right?

33:38.749 --> 33:40.648
- Yeah.
- How's first week going?

33:40.816 --> 33:43.409
Good. Well, challenging, actually.

33:43.582 --> 33:44.947
Yeah, mine too.

33:45.116 --> 33:47.878
I broke my bow playing Bartok.

33:48.050 --> 33:49.710
- Sounds painful.
- Yeah, it is.

33:49.883 --> 33:53.611
I have to use this lame loaner
till I can get to the music store.

33:53.783 --> 33:55.750
- They loan instruments here?
- Yeah. Just...

33:57.450 --> 33:58.439
Hey, I'm off to practice.

33:58.616 --> 34:00.549
- But I'll see you around?
- Okay, yeah.

34:00.716 --> 34:02.149
Bye.

34:06.983 --> 34:07.972
Hi.

34:09.417 --> 34:10.474
Yes?

34:10.649 --> 34:13.639
Yeah. Can I borrow that violin, please?

34:13.815 --> 34:15.942
This is a viola.

34:16.116 --> 34:19.242
I meant the other violin.

34:19.417 --> 34:21.440
- To the right.
- To the...

34:21.616 --> 34:23.583
Okay.

34:25.283 --> 34:27.409
- Are you a student here?
- Yes, sir, I am.

34:27.581 --> 34:29.311
Can I see some ID, please?

34:29.482 --> 34:31.040
I have it right here.

34:33.382 --> 34:34.974
Okay.

34:39.581 --> 34:41.277
One violin.

34:43.716 --> 34:46.706
- Need a bow, too?
- Oh, yes, please.

34:46.882 --> 34:48.713
Of course.

34:53.382 --> 34:55.713
So, are you entering the competition?

34:55.882 --> 34:59.441
- What competition?
- That competition.

35:00.749 --> 35:02.716
There you go.

35:11.616 --> 35:14.277
Hey, Simon.

35:14.449 --> 35:17.541
- How's London?
- <i>What do you think? It's cold and it's wet.</i>

35:17.716 --> 35:19.876
<i>Where's my rent money?</i>

35:20.050 --> 35:22.210
I'm sorry. It's late.

35:22.383 --> 35:26.713
You know, I had an unexpected setback,
but I'm working on it.

35:26.883 --> 35:29.782
<i>Oh, well, you better work quickly,
or you're out on the street.</i>

35:29.950 --> 35:32.781
<i>Listen, Johnnie, I'm not messing around here.</i>

35:32.950 --> 35:34.541
- <i>You hearing me?</i>
- I hear you.

35:57.950 --> 36:00.382
Hey, what's going on, baby?

36:11.549 --> 36:13.539
Oh, I love your place.

36:13.716 --> 36:16.309
Yeah, thanks. It's not mine.

36:16.482 --> 36:19.415
- You okay?
- Yeah, fine.

36:19.582 --> 36:21.072
What's that?

36:21.250 --> 36:23.580
It's a loaner violin from my school.

36:24.649 --> 36:25.707
Crazy idea.

36:25.883 --> 36:29.372
You can enter into this contest
for the Peterson Foundation.

36:29.549 --> 36:32.107
Winner gets $25,000.

36:32.283 --> 36:35.079
So you could buy a new violin.
And you get a full scholarship

36:35.250 --> 36:37.546
to the Manhattan Conservatory of the Arts,

36:37.716 --> 36:41.945
which would qualify you for a student visa.

36:50.549 --> 36:54.312
I don't need a handout from any conservatory.

36:54.482 --> 36:56.312
What's wrong with conservatories?

36:56.482 --> 36:58.574
Oh, nothing, if you're a spoiled rich kid

36:58.749 --> 37:01.375
willing to conform to the rules and politics
of an elitist school

37:01.549 --> 37:03.573
promoting success over arts.

37:03.749 --> 37:05.046
I see.

37:05.216 --> 37:07.115
And you're above all that,
down in the subway,

37:07.283 --> 37:09.045
where you're really nurturing your art.

37:09.216 --> 37:11.705
I play what I want, when I want.

37:12.616 --> 37:14.913
I don't get you.

37:15.083 --> 37:18.413
You've been given a gift,
but you play with so much anger.

37:18.582 --> 37:21.310
I'm surprised anyone
is brave enough to listen to you.

37:21.482 --> 37:22.972
Yeah, well, I'm not playing for them.

37:23.150 --> 37:25.083
Well, who are you playing for, yourself?

37:26.716 --> 37:29.808
You know, music is like dance.

37:29.983 --> 37:32.041
It's a link to the soul.

37:32.216 --> 37:34.808
It can make people laugh.
It can make people cry.

37:34.983 --> 37:37.041
It can inspire.

37:39.150 --> 37:41.117
With a power like that,

37:41.282 --> 37:44.443
why wouldn't you want
to share it with the world?

37:44.616 --> 37:46.947
I guess I'm not like you, then.

38:26.950 --> 38:28.042
Ruby!

38:41.482 --> 38:43.745
- Hi, Jazzy.
- <i>Hey, Ruby.</i>

38:43.916 --> 38:47.280
<i>A bunch of us are at Killarney's Pub.
Come meet us.</i>

38:48.883 --> 38:51.440
Johnnie! What's up, man?

38:52.616 --> 38:54.106
You doing all right, man?

38:54.282 --> 38:56.476
- Yeah.
- Really?

38:56.649 --> 38:58.275
You sure don't look too good to me, man.

38:59.282 --> 39:00.579
Yeah, we haven't heard you
playing your violin.

39:00.749 --> 39:02.114
Got stolen.

39:02.282 --> 39:05.148
Now, that's going to put
a dent in your pocket.

39:05.316 --> 39:06.806
Don't worry, bro man.

39:06.983 --> 39:08.643
We got your back. You can work with us.

39:08.816 --> 39:11.977
Thanks, guys, but I can't dance like you.

39:12.150 --> 39:14.412
Who said anything about dancing?

39:16.282 --> 39:18.272
All right, so, I'm up on stage.
We're doing that.

39:18.449 --> 39:20.575
Okay, so I'm doing all this...

39:20.749 --> 39:22.648
Hey, watch it, man!

39:22.816 --> 39:24.044
- What the...
- So sorry.

39:25.150 --> 39:26.048
Come on.

39:26.215 --> 39:28.944
- It was not his fault.
- Well, he should look where he's going.

39:29.116 --> 39:31.083
- He needs to grow a brain.
- You're such a snob.

39:32.282 --> 39:34.374
Ruby! Hey.

39:34.549 --> 39:38.380
- How was your mystery man?
- Disappointing.

39:39.816 --> 39:42.373
Bummer. Come on.

39:42.549 --> 39:45.107
We're eating fried food.
Should make you feel better.

39:45.282 --> 39:46.476
Hey.

39:46.649 --> 39:48.912
- Hi.
- Take a seat.

39:56.316 --> 39:58.045
Yeah!

39:58.215 --> 40:01.081
- He sounds pretty good.
- Yeah, he's okay.

40:02.716 --> 40:03.978
- I bet you could smoke him.
- Absolutely.

40:04.149 --> 40:06.548
I'm playing at a fundraiser tomorrow night.

40:06.716 --> 40:09.774
- Why don't you come see for yourself?
- All right. Sounds fun.

40:11.249 --> 40:14.273
- Hey.
- Hey. Do you mind?

40:30.050 --> 40:31.949
- That's it. Let's go, girls!
- Okay. What?

40:32.115 --> 40:35.378
We're getting up there. Let's go!

40:38.616 --> 40:41.082
- I can't believe we're gonna do this.
- You're going down.

40:43.215 --> 40:45.307
Come on, girls. Let's show them what we got.

42:03.215 --> 42:05.648
Watch out, gorgeous.

42:05.816 --> 42:08.373
- What's your name?
- I'm Jazzy.

42:08.549 --> 42:10.539
Of course you are.

43:25.215 --> 43:27.273
- Morning.
- Good morning.

43:33.649 --> 43:34.945
Jasmine!

43:40.549 --> 43:41.572
Let's begin.

43:48.249 --> 43:50.079
Why didn't you wake me?

43:50.249 --> 43:53.080
Are you kidding? You wouldn't budge.

43:53.249 --> 43:54.977
Breathe through.

43:57.149 --> 43:58.741
What time did you get in last night?

44:00.649 --> 44:02.877
You mean this morning.

44:06.382 --> 44:08.440
Were you with that guy from the pub?

44:08.616 --> 44:10.708
His name's Paolo.

44:14.416 --> 44:16.781
He is so hot.

44:18.915 --> 44:21.382
He seemed crazy.

44:21.549 --> 44:23.812
And possibly chemically altered.

44:23.982 --> 44:27.746
Yeah. But did you see his sexy bike?

44:27.915 --> 44:29.746
Will you stop talking there?

44:34.416 --> 44:37.076
Stretch. More! More!

44:37.249 --> 44:39.875
Don't you have that thing tonight with Kyle?

44:40.049 --> 44:43.539
Yes. Now, would you be quiet?

44:43.716 --> 44:46.239
- What are you going to wear?
- I'll show you when we get home.

44:50.149 --> 44:51.411
Absolutely not.

44:51.582 --> 44:54.912
- My wardrobe sucks.
- I agree.

44:55.082 --> 44:57.208
Don't you have a sexy little dress?

44:58.616 --> 45:00.810
- That's black.
- What's wrong with black?

45:00.982 --> 45:03.279
Everyone's gonna be in black.
You want to stand out.

45:03.449 --> 45:07.439
No, I didn't want to be flashy.
I don't even know if this is a date.

45:07.616 --> 45:09.980
But the right dress could make it a date.

45:10.982 --> 45:12.711
Okay, nothing in here. Come on.

45:12.882 --> 45:14.616
We're gonna have to go with my slam dunk.

45:31.249 --> 45:34.648
I'm sorry. It's just not
a challenging piece of music.

45:34.815 --> 45:36.907
- Well, not for you.
- Well, yeah...

45:39.749 --> 45:41.238
Wait a second. I'll be right back.

45:41.416 --> 45:43.780
I thought you were going solo tonight?

45:43.949 --> 45:46.882
Yeah, we'll see.
I like to keep my options open.

45:47.049 --> 45:48.482
You're such a player.

45:50.115 --> 45:51.241
- Hi.
- Hi.

45:52.815 --> 45:54.043
This is really nice.

45:54.215 --> 45:57.580
Yeah, well, my sponsor's putting it on.

45:57.749 --> 46:01.079
Some sort of obligation
to the whole dog and pony show.

46:03.449 --> 46:05.279
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

46:05.449 --> 46:09.109
Oh! They're gonna call me up
to play in a second, so...

46:09.282 --> 46:11.374
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah, I'll see you in a bit.

46:11.549 --> 46:13.981
- But you know, mingle. Have fun.
- Okay.

46:14.149 --> 46:15.877
I'd like to thank
our board members for arranging

46:16.049 --> 46:18.948
such a fabulous silent auction
for us tonight.

46:20.416 --> 46:24.281
Make sure you all place your generous bids.

46:24.449 --> 46:26.745
It's all for a good cause.

46:27.582 --> 46:29.310
Let me help you with that.

46:29.482 --> 46:32.812
Oh, it's you.

46:33.915 --> 46:36.246
I take it you're not pleased to see me?

46:36.416 --> 46:38.610
Sorry. I'm just surprised.

46:38.782 --> 46:42.307
I didn't think you were the tux type.

46:42.482 --> 46:45.574
Me neither. You look stunning.

46:46.815 --> 46:47.747
Thank you.

46:47.915 --> 46:50.246
So, what are you doing here?

46:51.449 --> 46:53.813
I was invited by a friend from school.

46:53.982 --> 46:55.449
How about you?

46:55.616 --> 46:56.912
They could use a lap around the room.

46:57.082 --> 47:00.049
We've ran out of smoked salmon.

47:00.215 --> 47:01.147
Hello.

47:01.316 --> 47:03.374
Hayward, this is Ruby.

47:03.949 --> 47:06.916
- Ruby. Nice to meet you.
- You too.

47:08.982 --> 47:11.142
- ...conservatory's most...
- Excuse me.

47:11.316 --> 47:13.476
...promising students...

47:13.649 --> 47:16.206
Kyle Endicott.

47:18.482 --> 47:20.608
So, is he your date?

47:21.582 --> 47:24.481
Oh, I don't think so.

47:24.649 --> 47:26.616
You look like a young man

47:26.782 --> 47:27.908
who knows how to dance.

47:28.082 --> 47:29.606
I'm just a server.

47:29.782 --> 47:31.545
Well, you're on break now.

47:31.715 --> 47:33.444
Be a doll, please. Come on.

47:37.882 --> 47:38.814
Hi.

47:44.915 --> 47:47.711
- You want dance with me?
- Oh, please...

47:55.648 --> 47:57.309
Oh, sorry.

47:59.049 --> 48:01.539
- My goodness, you're an agile one.
- Thank you.

48:02.915 --> 48:04.405
I try.

48:04.582 --> 48:05.276
Oh, no.

48:05.449 --> 48:07.642
I better save that poor girl
from my blundering husband.

48:07.815 --> 48:10.714
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.

48:12.049 --> 48:13.243
Thank you.

48:17.215 --> 48:18.477
Shall we?

48:34.449 --> 48:37.041
- Where did you learn to tango?
- My grandmother.

48:37.215 --> 48:39.613
- She must have been a good dancer.
- She was.

48:40.282 --> 48:43.737
- The boy can move.
- So can his girl.

48:43.915 --> 48:45.405
So you have a new job?

48:45.582 --> 48:48.208
Yes. I've been humbled
since our last meeting,

48:48.382 --> 48:49.973
which I want to apologize for.

48:52.815 --> 48:55.941
You don't have to do that. I was being pushy.

48:56.115 --> 48:59.105
I mean, I don't even know you.

49:00.815 --> 49:02.112
Do you want to?

49:32.149 --> 49:36.105
Excuse me. I think there are some dishes
in the kitchen that need your attention.

49:36.282 --> 49:37.442
Come on, Ruby. You don't
have to dance with the help.

49:37.615 --> 49:38.912
Let go, Kyle. Let go.

49:39.082 --> 49:41.208
- You heard her.
- What did you say?

49:41.382 --> 49:42.871
- Please don't.
- Wait, wait, wait.

49:43.049 --> 49:44.811
Wait a minute. I know you.

49:44.982 --> 49:50.109
You're the guy who plays for money
on the subway, right?

49:50.282 --> 49:52.306
That's right. Now back off.

49:54.249 --> 49:56.443
What, you want to settle this outside?

49:56.615 --> 49:58.809
I'm fine to settle it right here.

50:05.449 --> 50:06.574
May I?

50:09.715 --> 50:12.308
What are you gonna do, pass around a hat?

51:59.249 --> 52:01.943
- Excuse me. Could I borrow this?
- Sure.

52:23.548 --> 52:24.947
- What about this, Johnnie?
- What?

53:00.149 --> 53:01.376
Bring it.

53:32.481 --> 53:34.607
- Take that, street hack.
- What?

53:34.782 --> 53:36.874
- You think you're so tough?
- Calm down! Hey, that's enough!

53:37.049 --> 53:38.811
- Please call security.
- I got it!

53:39.915 --> 53:42.780
Back off. Go back to the subway
before I mop the floor with your face.

53:42.949 --> 53:44.643
- Security's here.
- Yeah, you better get out of here.

53:44.815 --> 53:46.577
- What about you guys?
- Don't worry. We're street dancers.

53:46.748 --> 53:49.272
- We always piss someone off.
- Over here. Right now.

53:49.581 --> 53:51.208
- Let's go.
- You better run.

53:51.381 --> 53:52.780
I'm going this way.

53:52.949 --> 53:56.448
- Who are these people?
- We're the Switch Steps.

53:57.615 --> 53:59.207
And reach.

54:00.149 --> 54:01.308
Yes.

54:01.481 --> 54:03.641
Toe. Up!

54:04.715 --> 54:06.944
Whoa. Turn.

54:08.149 --> 54:09.809
Up, stand.

54:09.982 --> 54:11.573
Turn.

54:11.748 --> 54:12.771
And dip.

54:12.949 --> 54:14.609
And yes.

54:16.782 --> 54:20.408
And up. Yes. Bravo.

54:21.648 --> 54:24.138
Good work, everyone.

54:26.782 --> 54:29.647
And you too. Very good.

54:30.748 --> 54:32.408
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

54:41.448 --> 54:42.710
Ruby.

54:42.882 --> 54:44.906
- Is everything all right?
- Yes.

54:45.082 --> 54:46.878
I just want a little more time.

54:47.049 --> 54:49.141
You danced it beautifully.

54:49.315 --> 54:52.407
- I can do it better.
- You're too hard on yourself.

54:53.748 --> 54:55.738
I just want to be perfect.

54:55.915 --> 54:58.381
And what happens
when you've achieved perfection?

54:58.548 --> 55:00.538
You stop then?

55:00.715 --> 55:05.541
It's imperfections that keep us alive,
motivating us to push further and further.

55:05.715 --> 55:08.876
Come, let's try from the developpÃ©. Music.

55:17.214 --> 55:18.079
No. Too square.

55:18.248 --> 55:20.306
Don't worry about technique now.

55:20.481 --> 55:22.641
DeveloppÃ© and pliÃ©.

55:26.481 --> 55:27.709
This is the problem.

55:27.882 --> 55:30.212
Stop trying to dance.

55:30.381 --> 55:31.939
But I'm a dancer.

55:32.115 --> 55:34.082
No, no, you're not a dancer
in this variation.

55:34.248 --> 55:36.738
You're a gypsy. Proud, upright.

55:37.581 --> 55:39.946
You understand? Again.

57:11.615 --> 57:15.548
It's good now. Very good.

57:16.949 --> 57:18.540
Thank you.

57:18.715 --> 57:23.307
Ruby, each time you conquer a step,

57:23.481 --> 57:26.209
there will always be
another challenge waiting.

57:26.381 --> 57:28.473
It's a long road. It never ends.

57:29.049 --> 57:31.641
As dancers, this is our journey.

57:50.915 --> 57:53.438
- Hi.
- Hey.

57:57.315 --> 57:58.907
What are you doing here?

57:59.081 --> 58:03.447
Well, it appears I've made
an ass of myself for a second time.

58:04.248 --> 58:06.909
So, instead of saying "sorry"...

58:08.081 --> 58:10.071
again...

58:10.248 --> 58:11.715
I've come to ask for a favor.

58:12.815 --> 58:14.475
Are you kidding me?

58:14.648 --> 58:16.877
No.

58:17.048 --> 58:21.539
I'd like to take you up on that
very generous offer of that loaner violin,

58:21.715 --> 58:25.273
so maybe I can enter
the Peterson competition.

58:28.081 --> 58:31.276
You know, I don't think you have
enough discipline to make that happen.

58:31.982 --> 58:33.107
Let me prove it to you.

58:35.415 --> 58:36.911
What do you say?

58:37.114 --> 58:40.639
You know, that was a really idiotic,
macho stunt you pulled with Kyle.

58:42.481 --> 58:44.471
Yeah, I think he won that battle.

58:46.281 --> 58:50.647
Of course, I could make it up to you
with an apology dinner?

58:54.548 --> 58:57.037
Do I have to change?

58:57.214 --> 58:58.738
I'll take you however I can get you.

59:00.949 --> 59:02.575
8:00, my place?

59:07.114 --> 59:08.945
I'll see you then.

59:14.214 --> 59:16.147
- Hey.
- Hi.

59:19.615 --> 59:22.582
- Is that Johnnie?
- Yeah.

59:23.882 --> 59:25.542
Definitely sexy fierce.

59:54.648 --> 59:55.637
Hello.

59:57.981 --> 59:59.209
Hi.

01:00:01.248 --> 01:00:04.272
So, this is your apology?

01:00:04.448 --> 01:00:06.312
Yeah.

01:00:09.581 --> 01:00:10.548
It's working.

01:00:13.815 --> 01:00:17.611
- Did you cook?
- No, my man Krispy did.

01:00:19.281 --> 01:00:20.873
Thank you for coming.

01:00:23.048 --> 01:00:24.811
You're welcome.

01:00:27.315 --> 01:00:30.373
So, I saw you dancing
for the first time today.

01:00:31.914 --> 01:00:33.711
Didn't know dance could be like that.

01:00:35.782 --> 01:00:37.544
So beautiful.

01:00:41.481 --> 01:00:45.312
I have this problem letting go.

01:00:46.581 --> 01:00:48.979
Something you do really well.

01:00:49.815 --> 01:00:53.077
- Apparently a little too well.
- Sometimes.

01:00:55.914 --> 01:00:57.313
I brought you the violin.

01:01:00.214 --> 01:01:02.238
Thank you.

01:01:06.748 --> 01:01:08.772
You're a very generous person, you know that?

01:01:11.415 --> 01:01:12.746
Crazy idea.

01:01:13.114 --> 01:01:17.877
But there's this competition.
And I need a dancer.

01:01:19.648 --> 01:01:23.445
- Will you compete with me?
- Of course I will.

01:01:23.615 --> 01:01:27.639
Good. Shall we give it a go?

01:02:00.615 --> 01:02:02.445
That was beautiful.

01:02:05.281 --> 01:02:07.441
I like playing for you.

01:02:56.381 --> 01:02:58.143
- Hi.
- See you later.

01:03:03.948 --> 01:03:06.415
- Hey...
- Hey!

01:03:06.581 --> 01:03:08.070
Where have you been?

01:03:08.248 --> 01:03:10.613
I covered for you in class this morning.

01:03:11.481 --> 01:03:14.107
Thanks. I had a slow start.

01:03:20.781 --> 01:03:23.078
You look way too happy
to be sewing that pointe shoe.

01:03:23.248 --> 01:03:24.476
What?

01:03:24.648 --> 01:03:26.581
You're glowing.

01:03:26.747 --> 01:03:29.078
- It's blinding me.
- Stop it.

01:03:29.881 --> 01:03:31.644
Must have been some dinner you had.

01:03:33.048 --> 01:03:34.878
Okay, fine.

01:03:35.048 --> 01:03:37.140
If you're not going to tell me anything,
I'm gonna go get coffee.

01:03:50.114 --> 01:03:51.638
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:03:52.648 --> 01:03:55.308
Haven't really talked
to you since the benefit.

01:03:55.481 --> 01:03:58.471
Your friend is quite a piece of work.

01:03:58.648 --> 01:04:00.807
I can't believe he challenged me like that.

01:04:00.981 --> 01:04:04.278
- Well, it takes two to tango.
- Funny.

01:04:05.948 --> 01:04:09.109
So, I heard you entered
the String & Dance Competition with him.

01:04:10.481 --> 01:04:12.913
You do know he doesn't know squat
about playing classical violin, right?

01:04:13.081 --> 01:04:15.071
Well, you're entitled to your opinion.

01:04:15.248 --> 01:04:17.306
And you should come dance
on my team, in fact.

01:04:17.481 --> 01:04:20.414
That's sneaky, Kyle.
Poaching other people's dancers.

01:04:20.581 --> 01:04:23.480
What can I say? I'm a competitive guy.

01:04:23.648 --> 01:04:26.479
Plus, you know, all the major dance companies
will be at the performance.

01:04:26.648 --> 01:04:29.808
So it really is in your best interest.

01:04:29.981 --> 01:04:32.278
That's pretty cold.

01:04:35.747 --> 01:04:37.771
Okay, then.

01:04:37.948 --> 01:04:39.142
I will take that as a no.

01:04:41.481 --> 01:04:43.539
Too bad.

01:04:43.714 --> 01:04:47.045
I guess April and I will just
have to annihilate you both.

01:04:47.214 --> 01:04:49.874
Take all the money, glory.

01:04:58.615 --> 01:05:00.877
- Hi!
- Hey, Ruby.

01:05:02.647 --> 01:05:03.478
Right on time.

01:05:06.315 --> 01:05:08.747
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:05:08.914 --> 01:05:13.075
We're up against Kyle and April.
One of MCA's best dancers.

01:05:13.981 --> 01:05:17.641
It's all right. I've got a plan.

01:05:24.148 --> 01:05:26.047
What?

01:05:26.214 --> 01:05:29.113
So, you want us to dance with you
in a classical shindig?

01:05:29.281 --> 01:05:30.747
Yes.

01:05:32.481 --> 01:05:33.573
Hell, yeah!

01:05:39.114 --> 01:05:40.376
- Let's do this.
- They're gonna love this show.

01:05:40.548 --> 01:05:42.481
Thank you, man. Thanks for this opportunity.

01:05:51.881 --> 01:05:54.542
- Point your toes!
- Here. Okay.

01:06:02.214 --> 01:06:03.044
Do it again!

01:06:05.281 --> 01:06:07.043
And we can have a beefy bass drum.

01:06:08.048 --> 01:06:09.071
That's it.

01:06:14.781 --> 01:06:16.748
Girl, you so tight. That's not it.

01:06:16.914 --> 01:06:18.904
You're all up. You gotta sink in that hip.

01:06:20.448 --> 01:06:22.880
- How much is this?
- It's $125,000.

01:06:24.481 --> 01:06:26.243
- Is it really that much?
- I don't know.

01:06:27.248 --> 01:06:28.146
Yes!

01:06:31.981 --> 01:06:35.278
- No Mingazzi violin.
- Thanks anyway.

01:06:38.781 --> 01:06:40.305
Look at that. You're such a show-off.

01:06:40.481 --> 01:06:42.311
I'm telling you, it's perfect.

01:06:59.381 --> 01:07:01.143
Harder. Sharper.

01:07:02.114 --> 01:07:03.978
Don't just dance through it! Feel it!

01:07:25.914 --> 01:07:27.279
- Hey.
- Hi, there.

01:07:30.647 --> 01:07:32.239
- Are you ready?
- Yeah!

01:07:33.714 --> 01:07:34.942
Hello.

01:07:35.114 --> 01:07:36.411
Hi.

01:07:40.781 --> 01:07:41.941
Don't wait up.

01:07:43.714 --> 01:07:46.704
Hey. You're too stiff.

01:07:48.981 --> 01:07:50.380
What's up with your roommate?

01:07:50.547 --> 01:07:53.981
Oh, she doesn't even know how to have fun.

01:07:54.148 --> 01:07:56.478
But you know, I do.

01:07:58.114 --> 01:08:00.637
- So where are we going?
- Don't worry.

01:08:00.814 --> 01:08:04.043
You're gonna love it.

01:08:14.547 --> 01:08:17.479
Move those hips! Show of hands, Eva.

01:08:18.479 --> 01:08:20.470
Jasmine, I see you.

01:08:26.913 --> 01:08:28.881
Five, six, back up.

01:08:30.546 --> 01:08:32.810
Ruby, what are you doing? This is not ballet.

01:08:32.981 --> 01:08:34.412
Very good, April.

01:08:35.948 --> 01:08:37.313
Up!

01:08:37.479 --> 01:08:39.380
Jasmine, come here.

01:08:41.048 --> 01:08:43.207
You're late. You know the rules.

01:08:43.381 --> 01:08:45.745
Sit. And see Markova after class.

01:08:45.913 --> 01:08:47.470
You, too, Ruby.

01:08:47.647 --> 01:08:49.773
All right, everyone else,
I want to do it again!

01:08:51.948 --> 01:08:54.073
Yes! Hit it!

01:08:57.613 --> 01:09:00.546
Ruby, short lines. Move it!

01:09:02.214 --> 01:09:03.737
What is going on with you two?

01:09:07.148 --> 01:09:09.944
Mm? What is going on with you two?

01:09:10.948 --> 01:09:14.938
You know that you are under more scrutiny
than the dancers that pay full tuition.

01:09:15.113 --> 01:09:16.944
I understand that.

01:09:17.113 --> 01:09:19.580
I can't tell you how much this
scholarship means to me.

01:09:19.747 --> 01:09:20.805
Me too.

01:09:20.981 --> 01:09:24.278
Ruby, there is no denying your dedication,

01:09:24.447 --> 01:09:28.904
but we were hoping to see you making more
progress in your contemporary class.

01:09:29.081 --> 01:09:31.741
Unfortunately, it's not happening.

01:09:31.913 --> 01:09:33.778
So, we are placing you under review.

01:09:36.747 --> 01:09:39.407
As for you, Jasmine,
I don't know what to say.

01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:42.774
You are one of our most talented dancers.

01:09:42.948 --> 01:09:44.642
And you work the least.

01:09:44.814 --> 01:09:46.371
Jasmine, this is your last warning.

01:09:48.781 --> 01:09:52.645
Next time you are late for a class,
you will be expelled.

01:09:56.315 --> 01:09:57.906
That's all.

01:10:19.881 --> 01:10:21.871
What does it mean?

01:10:22.048 --> 01:10:24.605
"To strike a note emphatically."

01:10:27.414 --> 01:10:30.381
And...

01:10:30.547 --> 01:10:32.105
this one?

01:10:34.314 --> 01:10:36.804
That was the date my grandfather died.

01:10:40.248 --> 01:10:41.714
I'm sorry.

01:10:44.514 --> 01:10:46.981
Don't worry. Everything's gonna be okay.

01:10:48.547 --> 01:10:50.980
This competition
is going to change everything.

01:11:18.948 --> 01:11:20.312
Hello?

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:23.538
- <i>Hi, honey, it's me.</i>
- Hi, Mom.

01:11:23.714 --> 01:11:26.204
- <i>Is something the matter?</i>
- No.

01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:28.313
Nothing, nothing. I'm good.

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:31.276
<i>Listen, I fixed it with work,
and they let me off.</i>

01:11:31.447 --> 01:11:32.971
- You're coming?
- <i>Yes.</i>

01:11:33.881 --> 01:11:35.711
- To the competition?
- <i>Yes.</i>

01:11:35.881 --> 01:11:39.279
- <i>They gave me the whole weekend.</i>
- Oh, Mom, I am so excited.

01:11:39.447 --> 01:11:41.744
<i>Yeah, me too.</i>

01:11:41.914 --> 01:11:43.881
- Whoa. I'm late.
- <i>Oh.</i>

01:11:44.048 --> 01:11:46.072
- Mom, I'll call you back, okay?
- <i>Okay. Bye.</i>

01:11:46.247 --> 01:11:48.044
Jazz, we got to get up.

01:11:49.547 --> 01:11:52.571
- Come on. It's after 8:00.
- Stop it.

01:11:52.881 --> 01:11:54.814
- Leave me alone.
- Come on, we have class.

01:11:54.981 --> 01:11:57.914
I don't know about you, but I'm planning
on keeping my scholarship.

01:11:58.081 --> 01:12:00.912
I'm sleeping!

01:12:01.081 --> 01:12:03.206
Get off my bed, you bitch!

01:12:10.447 --> 01:12:14.403
I'm sorry. I'm just so tired.

01:12:15.414 --> 01:12:18.711
Because you've been going
to bed at 4:00 in the morning.

01:12:19.714 --> 01:12:22.374
I can't dance today.

01:12:22.547 --> 01:12:24.139
I don't feel well.

01:12:24.314 --> 01:12:26.145
What are you doing, Jazzy?

01:12:26.981 --> 01:12:29.311
I can't believe you're just going
to throw everything away

01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:31.413
so you can party with this guy.

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:33.547
Yeah, I like him!

01:12:33.714 --> 01:12:35.806
What about your dreams and everything?

01:12:35.981 --> 01:12:38.107
Everything that you've worked for?

01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:42.643
Have you completely forgotten who you are?

01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:46.606
I'm a dancer.

01:12:46.781 --> 01:12:49.304
Then start acting like one.

01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:52.376
And get your butt out of bed.

01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:56.877
Dancers dance, no matter what.

01:13:17.847 --> 01:13:18.779
Hey, there's Jazzy.

01:13:27.113 --> 01:13:31.570
- Oh, look who decided to show up.
- That's right, April.

01:13:31.747 --> 01:13:35.044
You better watch your back,
because I'm going to sweat all over it.

01:13:35.213 --> 01:13:37.646
That's just gross.

01:13:38.781 --> 01:13:42.477
You are coming to watch me and Kyle in the
String & Dance Competition tomorrow, right?

01:13:42.647 --> 01:13:45.239
- Right.
- Of course we're going.

01:13:45.414 --> 01:13:47.404
- Have you seen Kyle and April's number?
- No.

01:13:47.948 --> 01:13:50.312
I heard they have some Joffrey dancers
on their team.

01:14:09.147 --> 01:14:10.637
Excited?

01:14:10.814 --> 01:14:14.269
Yeah. And a little nervous.

01:14:14.447 --> 01:14:18.040
- You guys are going to be great.
- Thanks.

01:14:18.213 --> 01:14:19.771
I wish you were dancing with us.

01:14:19.948 --> 01:14:22.414
Well, I should have said yes when you asked.

01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:23.569
I was an idiot.

01:14:23.747 --> 01:14:26.373
- Next year.
- Yes.

01:14:30.213 --> 01:14:32.442
- Hello?
- <i>Hello. Ms. Adams?</i>

01:14:32.614 --> 01:14:35.206
- This is Ruby.
- <i>Lenny here. The consignment store.</i>

01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:37.244
- <i>Listen, I got a surprise for you.</i>
- What?

01:14:37.414 --> 01:14:40.404
<i>I got your boyfriend's fancy violin.</i>

01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:41.911
You're kidding me!

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:43.604
<i>If you want it,
you better come over and pick it up</i>

01:14:43.781 --> 01:14:45.441
<i>because I don't do home delivery, all right?</i>

01:14:45.614 --> 01:14:48.240
Okay, I'll be right there.

01:14:48.981 --> 01:14:50.242
What is it? What happened?

01:14:51.914 --> 01:14:54.745
They found Johnnie's violin.

01:14:54.914 --> 01:14:58.745
Johnnie!

01:14:58.914 --> 01:15:00.244
What's up, man?

01:15:00.414 --> 01:15:02.108
Yo, we're heading out
to pick up the rest of the crew.

01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:05.042
- Yeah, see you at the theater?
- Yeah. At 6:30. Don't be late.

01:15:05.213 --> 01:15:08.374
Yeah, right. We're about to kill it!

01:15:08.547 --> 01:15:11.070
Get out.

01:15:18.314 --> 01:15:20.577
Wish me luck.

01:15:32.981 --> 01:15:35.243
Hold on a second. I got eyes on him.

01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:41.447
Johnnie Blackwell?

01:15:42.814 --> 01:15:44.007
Yeah.

01:15:44.213 --> 01:15:45.612
This way, sir.

01:15:56.414 --> 01:16:00.609
- This is so thrilling.
- Yeah. Pretty cool.

01:16:04.380 --> 01:16:06.142
- This theater is beautiful.
- Yeah.

01:16:10.814 --> 01:16:12.474
- And then, G8...
- Excuse me.

01:16:12.647 --> 01:16:14.477
Has Johnnie Blackwell checked in?

01:16:14.647 --> 01:16:15.739
- Blackwell?
- Uh-huh.

01:16:15.914 --> 01:16:17.540
Go to the Bs here.

01:16:17.714 --> 01:16:19.442
- No. Sorry.
- Nah, I don't see him.

01:16:19.614 --> 01:16:21.046
Thanks.

01:16:36.814 --> 01:16:38.474
No Johnnie?

01:16:39.547 --> 01:16:41.776
I don't get it.

01:16:41.947 --> 01:16:43.971
What did he say to you when you saw him?

01:16:44.714 --> 01:16:46.704
Just that he'll meet us here at 6:30.

01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:52.013
- This isn't like Johnnie.
- Let's try him again.

01:17:00.614 --> 01:17:04.103
Did you see that? Man, you pushed me!

01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:06.770
I have witnesses. I want my lawyer.

01:17:07.447 --> 01:17:09.437
How long have you been in the US?

01:17:09.614 --> 01:17:11.581
I'm not sure.

01:17:11.747 --> 01:17:13.441
Let me help you.

01:17:18.647 --> 01:17:20.739
You seem nervous.

01:17:20.913 --> 01:17:21.902
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:27.241
<i>welcome to the Peterson Foundation's
String & Dance Competition.</i>

01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:05.106
<i>Five-minute warning for Kyle and April.
Five minutes.</i>

01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:20.879
Listen, kid, this isn't about you.
How well do you know this guy?

01:18:23.747 --> 01:18:25.737
Love to know.
He scammed me out of five grand.

01:18:25.913 --> 01:18:27.403
Where can I get ahold of him?

01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:28.808
I don't know.

01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:30.208
Will you help us find him?

01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:35.108
Yes, but there's somewhere
I really need to be right now.

01:18:56.614 --> 01:18:57.774
- Beautiful.
- Impressive.

01:18:59.447 --> 01:19:01.107
So, what do we do now?

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:02.906
That means we have to withdraw.

01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:04.808
Nah, it doesn't feel right.

01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:06.913
Johnnie wouldn't bail on us.

01:19:26.614 --> 01:19:29.012
Nice.

01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:42.204
Okay, we are ready for you guys.

01:19:43.414 --> 01:19:44.711
Let's go. Upstairs.

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:46.643
We still have a few minutes.

01:19:47.447 --> 01:19:49.913
Let's go ahead and get ready, just in case.

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:51.604
- Yeah, she's right. Come on.
- Come on, guys.

01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:54.043
Let's go.

01:19:57.147 --> 01:19:58.738
Hayward?

01:19:58.913 --> 01:20:03.710
I really hope this audience gets
a chance to see you guys dance.

01:20:03.846 --> 01:20:06.609
It's like you said, it ain't over yet.

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:44.445
Okay, this group is up next.
Hey, you guys ready?

01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:51.276
- Johnnie, you made it!
- Yeah, we're ready.

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:55.140
- I'm so sorry.
- So close.

01:20:55.314 --> 01:20:56.940
- So close.
- All right, we're ready now.

01:21:19.247 --> 01:21:21.305
Bravo.

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:38.470
All right, let's rearrange
the stands and chairs.

01:21:42.614 --> 01:21:43.944
Next, get ready for the lighting cue.

01:21:44.113 --> 01:21:45.478
Good luck beating that.

01:21:47.514 --> 01:21:49.742
Aha! Finally.

01:21:49.913 --> 01:21:51.777
Here we go. Let's do it, man.

01:21:51.947 --> 01:21:54.278
- You ready?
- Absolutely.

01:21:54.980 --> 01:21:58.072
I think this might help.

01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:00.846
Where did you find it?

01:22:01.846 --> 01:22:04.813
Sometimes people can surprise you.

01:22:06.414 --> 01:22:07.744
Thank you.

01:22:08.746 --> 01:22:11.475
<i>Our next contestant,
playing his original composition</i>

01:22:11.646 --> 01:22:15.444
<i>titled</i> Fortando, <i>violinist Johnnie Blackwell,</i>

01:22:15.613 --> 01:22:18.774
<i>with dancers Ruby Adams and the Switch Steps.</i>

01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:34.370
- Where's the violinist?
- Where are the dancers?

01:27:43.546 --> 01:27:45.036
Completely indulgent.

01:27:45.213 --> 01:27:46.941
I disagree.

01:27:47.113 --> 01:27:50.205
Don't we want to evolve?
Don't we want to progress?

01:28:50.746 --> 01:28:53.212
She's like a completely different dancer.

01:28:53.379 --> 01:28:57.403
She's not dancer. She's gypsy.

01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:05.371
Bravo!

01:29:15.047 --> 01:29:17.570
All right, we need all
the contestants on stage, please.

01:29:18.780 --> 01:29:22.372
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for your patronage and support</i>

01:29:22.546 --> 01:29:24.945
<i>of this outstanding group of performers.</i>

01:29:25.113 --> 01:29:29.204
After a heated deliberation,
we have made a decision.

01:29:33.947 --> 01:29:36.573
The winner of the Peterson Foundation

01:29:36.746 --> 01:29:40.077
String & Dance Competition is...

01:29:44.313 --> 01:29:47.872
Johnnie Blackwell and his dancer, Ruby Adams,

01:29:48.047 --> 01:29:52.412
and the Switch Steps...

01:29:57.080 --> 01:29:58.410
Congratulations, young man.

01:29:59.279 --> 01:30:02.872
You are the recipient of the $25,000 prize,

01:30:03.047 --> 01:30:07.138
and a full scholarship
to the Manhattan Conservatory of the Arts.

01:30:07.313 --> 01:30:09.076
Would you like to say a few words?

01:30:11.379 --> 01:30:13.107
Thank you so much.

01:30:13.279 --> 01:30:15.076
This means more to me than you know.

01:30:15.246 --> 01:30:17.577
I'd like to share the money
with my brilliant crew,

01:30:17.746 --> 01:30:19.872
who I could not have done this without.

01:30:21.279 --> 01:30:22.644
Thank you for believing in me.

01:30:33.579 --> 01:30:35.136
TouchÃ©.

01:30:58.980 --> 01:31:02.743
<i>Music will always be there burning inside me.</i>

01:31:03.546 --> 01:31:07.377
<i>The difference is, now I understand
where it comes from,</i>

01:31:07.980 --> 01:31:09.776
<i>and I'm ready to share it.</i>

01:32:52.546 --> 01:32:53.774
<i>What's up?</i>
