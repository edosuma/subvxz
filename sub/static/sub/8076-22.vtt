[doorbell]

00:14.148 --> 00:16.484
Dan, wake up.

00:16.517 --> 00:17.518
Somebody's at the door.

00:17.551 --> 00:19.387
[grumble]

00:19.420 --> 00:21.489
Dan, wake up.

00:21.522 --> 00:22.756
[clap]

00:24.525 --> 00:28.028
Who the hell could it
be at 2:00 in the morning?

00:28.062 --> 00:29.430
[doorbell]

00:29.463 --> 00:32.733
I don't know, but whoever
it is, they're not going away.

00:36.070 --> 00:39.073
Oh, I had the weirdest dream.

00:39.107 --> 00:41.609
I was-- I finished my boat.

00:41.642 --> 00:43.111
Yeah, that really was a dream.

00:49.450 --> 00:54.222
I caught this big fish,
teeth, and it kept biting me.

00:54.255 --> 00:55.189
I think it was a Barracuda.

00:55.223 --> 00:57.425
Anyway, it wouldn't
stop biting me.

00:57.458 --> 00:58.326
What do you think that means?

01:01.262 --> 01:02.062
Mom!

THEME SONG: If what doesn't
kill us is making us stronger,

01:14.575 --> 01:19.213
we're gonna last longer than
the greatest wall in China

01:19.247 --> 01:22.350
or that rabbit with the drum.

01:22.383 --> 01:27.721
If there's one thing that
I've learned while waiting

01:27.755 --> 01:31.859
for my turn, it's that in
each life, some rain falls,

01:31.892 --> 01:35.263
but you also get some sun.

01:35.296 --> 01:39.099
And we'll make out
better than OK.

01:39.133 --> 01:41.969
Hear what I say.

01:42.002 --> 01:44.605
Hey, any day.

01:51.479 --> 01:52.880
[laugh]

02:01.989 --> 02:03.724
Mom, why didn't you
call us and tell us

02:03.757 --> 02:04.992
you'd been released?

02:05.025 --> 02:06.894
Well, there's only one
phone for the patients.

02:06.927 --> 02:10.298
And that Mrs. Dimpsey,
the one with Alzheimer's,

02:10.331 --> 02:12.766
she refused to get off the
phone until she remembered

02:12.800 --> 02:15.503
who she was talking to, so--

02:15.536 --> 02:20.174
so I just gave up,
and I hit the road.

02:20.208 --> 02:22.443
Well, we're very happy
to see you, Audrey.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.445
But you know, we could have
picked you up at the airport.

02:24.478 --> 02:25.979
Oh, I didn't fly.

02:26.013 --> 02:27.448
I came by bus.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.149
The bus?

02:29.183 --> 02:31.785
Mom, we-- we've got money now.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.654
We could have flown you here.

02:33.687 --> 02:38.626
Yeah, first class-- slippers,
hot towels, the works.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.328
No, heavens no, dear.

02:40.361 --> 02:42.095
I had a lovely seat on the bus.

02:42.129 --> 02:47.801
And besides, I can't go to
the bathroom on a plane.

02:47.835 --> 02:54.575
Those big blue blocks of
poo-poo that fall from the sky.

02:54.608 --> 02:55.676
And they kill people.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.548
I don't want to be responsible.

03:03.484 --> 03:06.153
Mom, are you sure you're OK?

03:06.186 --> 03:08.389
Oh, don't worry
about me, dear.

03:08.422 --> 03:12.526
I'm just so happy to
be out of that place.

03:12.560 --> 03:17.164
I really miss the simple things,
you know, like sitting down

03:17.197 --> 03:21.235
to a cup of tea with my family.

03:21.269 --> 03:22.236
And having a fork.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.476
You know, you
never know how much

03:28.509 --> 03:31.745
you miss the simple
things until they're

03:31.779 --> 03:34.415
wrenched from your hand.

03:34.448 --> 03:37.351
So what did the doctors say?

03:37.385 --> 03:38.752
Do you need any follow up?

03:38.786 --> 03:39.953
No, they said I'm well.

03:39.987 --> 03:42.323
Voila.

03:42.356 --> 03:46.059
Yes, I don't need to
go back there anymore.

03:46.093 --> 03:50.230
I'm 100% completely cured.

03:50.264 --> 03:57.671
Yes, I-- in fact, I don't think
I ever needed to be there.

03:57.705 --> 03:58.806
Don't worry.

03:58.839 --> 04:02.576
We'll take very good
care of your mother.

04:02.610 --> 04:04.978
[evil chuckling]

04:06.079 --> 04:09.417
[evil laughter]

04:18.459 --> 04:19.660
That's great.

04:19.693 --> 04:21.629
I'd skip and leap
around with glee,

04:21.662 --> 04:23.831
but it's 3:00 in the morning.

04:23.864 --> 04:26.066
Yeah, come on, Audrey, let
me show you to your room.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.935
Oh, no, dear.
Don't bother.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.470
I'll just sit here and
wait for you to wake up.

04:32.640 --> 04:39.279
My son, I gave you
life, and you've

04:39.313 --> 04:43.116
made my life what it is today.

04:51.024 --> 04:52.926
Well, we're gonna hit the hay!

04:52.960 --> 04:55.896
Um.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.832
Honey.

04:58.866 --> 05:00.434
First thing in the morning,
I'm calling a doctor.

05:07.007 --> 05:08.075
There, there.

05:08.108 --> 05:08.909
Mm.

05:19.453 --> 05:20.454
Yeah, yeah.

05:20.488 --> 05:21.522
Dr. Esther Hoss, hi.

05:21.555 --> 05:24.324
This is Dan Conner,
Audrey Conner's son.

05:24.358 --> 05:26.927
Yeah, thank you.

05:26.960 --> 05:30.431
The reason I'm calling is
because my mother showed

05:30.464 --> 05:33.233
up here last night, and I--

05:33.266 --> 05:36.136
oh, you did?

05:36.169 --> 05:38.406
OK, so everything's
all right then.

05:38.439 --> 05:39.339
OK, fine.

05:39.373 --> 05:40.741
Yeah, we were just
a little worried

05:40.774 --> 05:45.245
because she showed up here in
the middle of the night, and--

05:45.278 --> 05:46.146
OK, well, yeah.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.147
Thank you.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.982
I guess that's all
I needed to know.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.684
Thanks.

05:50.718 --> 05:51.985
So what'd the doctor say?

05:52.019 --> 05:53.887
He said he signed the
release form himself,

05:53.921 --> 05:56.289
and she's gonna be
fine as long as she

05:56.323 --> 05:57.425
keeps taking her medication.

05:57.458 --> 05:58.759
See, honey?
I told you.

05:58.792 --> 05:59.660
Everything's OK.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.662
You got nothing to worry about.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.164
She's as normal as you or me.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.799
[banging]

06:05.833 --> 06:06.767
DAN: Mom.

06:06.800 --> 06:07.668
Mom!

06:07.701 --> 06:08.669
Mom!

06:08.702 --> 06:09.570
Mom!

06:09.603 --> 06:10.838
What are you doing?

06:10.871 --> 06:13.741
Just whacking some nuts.

06:13.774 --> 06:16.477
Um, you're cooking?

06:16.510 --> 06:18.011
You don't know how to cook.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.547
Well, of course I do, dear.

06:19.580 --> 06:23.617
I read somewhere, if you
can read, you can cook.

06:23.651 --> 06:27.588
I'm making some
pancakes for Danny boy.

06:27.621 --> 06:30.724
(SINGING) Danny boy, the
pipes, the pipes are smiling.

06:30.758 --> 06:33.827
Is the batter supposed
to be all lumpy like that?

06:33.861 --> 06:37.264
Dear, those are just the nuts.

06:37.297 --> 06:39.967
Well, it looks
yummy yummy, but I'm

06:40.000 --> 06:41.201
afraid I can't eat pancakes.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.102
What?

06:42.135 --> 06:43.671
I'm on kind of a diet.

06:43.704 --> 06:44.872
Oh, come on.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.674
One isn't going to kill you.

06:46.707 --> 06:50.844
No, I gotta be good, but I'm
sure the rest of the family

06:50.878 --> 06:51.745
will just love it.

06:51.779 --> 06:52.580
No!

06:56.349 --> 06:58.886
This was meant for you.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.722
If you're not going to
have it, then nobody else

07:01.755 --> 07:03.156
is going to have it.

07:15.002 --> 07:18.472
Oh, I had such a wonderful
time this afternoon.

07:18.506 --> 07:22.009
Darlene and David's little
girl is so beautiful.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.376
Yeah, she sure is.

07:23.410 --> 07:26.279
That little girl's gonna
break a lot of hearts.

07:26.313 --> 07:30.250
Yes, children are good
at that, aren't they?

07:30.283 --> 07:32.520
This is so nice, isn't it?

07:32.553 --> 07:35.455
Just being together like this.

07:35.489 --> 07:36.990
Sure is.

07:37.024 --> 07:38.826
Yes, when you
were a little boy,

07:38.859 --> 07:41.094
you'd come put your
head in my lap,

07:41.128 --> 07:44.532
and we'd just sit
and talk things.

07:44.565 --> 07:46.399
Yeah.

07:46.433 --> 07:49.302
Do you remember when I used
to bring you out to the parties

07:49.336 --> 07:50.538
to do the twist?

07:50.571 --> 07:51.572
[laugh]

07:53.006 --> 07:59.012
One time-- one time, you threw
up on your father's boss.

07:59.046 --> 08:00.013
Yeah.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.348
Mr. Creighton, remember?

08:01.381 --> 08:02.650
Yeah, Mr. Creighton.

08:02.683 --> 08:05.485
I had that real bad flu, and
you dragged me out of bed.

08:05.519 --> 08:07.921
It was almost like you wanted
me to throw up on Mr. Creighton.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.456
You hated him.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.758
No, I didn't hate him, dear.

08:10.791 --> 08:13.627
I thought he was a moron.

08:13.661 --> 08:14.828
There's a big difference.

08:14.862 --> 08:17.264
You see, when you hate
someone, well, you almost

08:17.297 --> 08:20.801
have this violent feeling.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.236
But when you think
they're morons,

08:23.270 --> 08:25.573
you just hope for their
unhappiness and failure.

08:25.606 --> 08:27.575
That's the difference.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.743
But you never listen
to your old mother.

08:29.777 --> 08:34.047
Yeah, that was the most
humiliating night of my life.

08:34.081 --> 08:36.116
Not as humiliating
as trying to eat

08:36.149 --> 08:39.019
a steak with a spoon in
a cafeteria with a bunch

08:39.052 --> 08:39.887
of nervous patients.

08:42.656 --> 08:45.659
We'll take very good
care of your mother.

08:45.693 --> 08:47.595
[evil chuckle]

08:47.628 --> 08:50.898
[evil laughter]

08:57.304 --> 08:59.807
Mom, what do you say
we bury the hatchet?

08:59.840 --> 09:01.274
[gasp]

09:01.308 --> 09:02.676
I didn't know
you had a hatchet.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.649
Where is it, dear?

09:08.682 --> 09:10.550
Mom, it's just an expression.

09:10.584 --> 09:12.519
We don't have a hatchet.

09:12.552 --> 09:15.122
It means we just stop arguing.

09:15.155 --> 09:16.123
Oh, dear, we're not arguing.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.391
We understand each
other perfectly.

09:18.425 --> 09:19.727
At least I understand you.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.629
You've never understood me.

09:21.662 --> 09:27.668
You always overreacted to
my little eccentricities.

09:27.701 --> 09:32.005
And if you throw someone
into the hospital, be sure

09:32.039 --> 09:33.440
you get a second opinion.

09:36.977 --> 09:42.149
Well, my, wasn't
that a nice chat?

09:42.182 --> 09:45.285
I think that I'll just
go and take a little nap.

09:45.318 --> 09:47.821
Dear, tell me, do you
have a space heater?

09:47.855 --> 09:51.058
Because it gets so
chilly in the basement.

09:51.091 --> 09:54.261
Yeah, I think we got
one out in the garage.

09:54.294 --> 09:55.095
Thank you.

10:16.650 --> 10:18.118
[engine shuts off]

10:18.151 --> 10:19.152
[door shuts]

10:20.153 --> 10:22.622
[pounding]

10:22.656 --> 10:24.124
[coughing]

10:24.157 --> 10:29.697
Hel-- help!

10:29.730 --> 10:30.530
Help!

10:42.209 --> 10:44.644
OK, now the point is to
sit close enough to the movie

10:44.678 --> 10:47.014
so it fills your
whole field of vision.

10:47.047 --> 10:49.349
But the tradeoffs
are foreshortened

10:49.382 --> 10:53.020
image and an inoptimal
reception of the THX sound.

10:53.053 --> 10:54.087
My goodness.

10:54.121 --> 10:55.622
In my day, we just
worried about sitting

10:55.655 --> 10:56.757
behind somebody with a hat.

10:59.559 --> 11:01.628
Prozac, Lithobid,
Xanax-- you've got

11:01.661 --> 11:03.831
a pretty good mix there.

11:03.864 --> 11:07.267
Not polite to read somebody
else's prescription labels,

11:07.300 --> 11:08.401
dear.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.070
Oh, well, I didn't
read the labels.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.005
I recognized the pills.

11:12.039 --> 11:13.440
You-- you've taken these?

11:13.473 --> 11:14.842
No, my mom has.

11:14.875 --> 11:18.578
Plus Mellaril, Xanax, Bispanol,
Haldol, Perazine, you name it.

11:18.611 --> 11:19.479
My goodness.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.748
What does she need them for?

11:20.781 --> 11:21.648
Oh, she's a little whacked.

11:24.885 --> 11:28.388
You know, so whenever she felt
bad, she'd just pop every pill

11:28.421 --> 11:31.859
and hope that one of them
would make her feel better.

11:31.892 --> 11:33.593
You know, Heather,
we gotta go.

11:33.626 --> 11:36.096
DJ, the movie's not
for another two hours.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.231
Oh, no, are we
really that late?

11:38.265 --> 11:41.368
What on earth do you kids
have to leave so early for?

11:41.401 --> 11:43.971
Oh, we're going to go
see "Return of the Jedi."

11:44.004 --> 11:45.472
Yeah, you must have
heard of it, Grandma.

11:45.505 --> 11:48.008
It's a late 70s
sci-fi genre pick.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.443
Yeah, but so are "Star Wars"
and the "Empire Strikes Back,"

11:50.477 --> 11:52.679
and you weren't nearly
as excited to see them.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.882
Yeah, well, this does
have a few features

11:54.915 --> 11:55.783
the other two lacked.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.684
Yeah, like what?

11:57.717 --> 12:00.053
Well, you know, advancements
in special effects,

12:00.087 --> 12:02.289
and sound quality, and
a whole lot of scenes

12:02.322 --> 12:04.224
with Princess Leia in a bikini.
[smack]

12:04.257 --> 12:05.325
[grunt]

12:05.358 --> 12:08.829
What'd you do that for?

12:08.862 --> 12:09.897
I'm sorry.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.664
I don't know why I did that.

12:16.036 --> 12:16.937
What's going on?

12:16.970 --> 12:18.638
I thought I heard
glass breaking.

12:18.671 --> 12:19.840
You didn't hear me yelling?

12:19.873 --> 12:22.175
I couldn't get the door open.

12:22.209 --> 12:24.644
Well, to go out a door, you
do what you did to get in,

12:24.677 --> 12:25.813
only backwards.

12:25.846 --> 12:27.647
Honey, this is serious.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.517
Somebody turned
the motorcycle on.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.552
If I hadn't had
broken that glass,

12:32.585 --> 12:33.954
I would have died in there.

12:33.987 --> 12:36.256
Well, yeah, or you could just
have turned the motorcycle off.

12:36.289 --> 12:37.390
I did.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.659
By then, the whole place
was filled with exhaust.

12:39.692 --> 12:42.029
Well, I always said that
motorcycle was dangerous.

12:42.062 --> 12:45.365
You know what?

12:45.398 --> 12:47.100
I don't think this
was an accident.

12:47.134 --> 12:48.368
Oh, don't be ridiculous, Dan.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.070
You probably just locked
yourself in there.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.638
Somebody had to
close that door.

12:51.671 --> 12:54.074
Doors just don't
shut by themselves.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.976
Somebody like the wind?

12:56.009 --> 13:00.180
Yes, I suppose Mr. Wind
started the motorcycle up too.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.349
Honey.

13:02.382 --> 13:06.386
I think my mom's
trying to kill me.

13:06.419 --> 13:07.720
OK, don't be ridiculous, Dan.

13:07.754 --> 13:09.689
How much of that exhaust
did you breath in?

13:09.722 --> 13:12.259
Apparently not as much
as she wanted me to.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.393
That is crazy.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.295
Why would she want to
do something like that?

13:15.328 --> 13:16.729
I think she's still
mad at me for putting

13:16.763 --> 13:17.664
her in the hospital.

13:17.697 --> 13:19.399
Dan, that was
over 20 years ago.

13:19.432 --> 13:21.634
I'm sure she's over it by now.

13:21.668 --> 13:24.437
I think she's still
got it in for me.

13:24.471 --> 13:27.340
You know, you really need
to stop blaming your mother

13:27.374 --> 13:29.209
for all of your problems.

13:29.242 --> 13:33.013
Honey, the woman just
got out of the hospital.

13:33.046 --> 13:33.914
Yeah.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.748
Out, remember?

13:35.782 --> 13:37.885
The doctor told us she was fine.

13:37.918 --> 13:39.786
No, the doctor told us
she was fine as long as she

13:39.819 --> 13:41.454
keeps taking her medication.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.190
Maybe-- maybe she stopped.

13:43.223 --> 13:44.557
Well, I really
think that you're

13:44.591 --> 13:46.659
worried about nothing, Dan.

13:46.693 --> 13:49.162
But just to be safe,
maybe you want to start

13:49.196 --> 13:51.798
carrying around a whistle.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.133
OK, come on,
Heather, let's go.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.234
God, could you relax?

13:54.267 --> 13:55.435
We've got plenty of time.

13:55.468 --> 13:56.803
No, we don't.

13:56.836 --> 14:00.173
The Lanford Sci-Fi Club has
been lined up since yesterday.

14:00.207 --> 14:01.208
Now wait a minute.

14:01.241 --> 14:02.475
Shouldn't you leave
those swords here?

14:02.509 --> 14:04.511
You certainly can't take
them to the theater with you.

14:04.544 --> 14:05.412
Yeah, we can.

14:05.445 --> 14:06.813
They're just toys.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.815
Besides, I'd like to see them
try and take it away from me.

14:08.848 --> 14:09.716
Oh!

14:09.749 --> 14:12.319
Come on, come on, come on, DJ.

14:12.352 --> 14:15.588
Let's see who the
real Jedi knight is!

14:15.622 --> 14:16.489
[laugh]

14:16.523 --> 14:17.857
Grandma, this is not real.

14:17.891 --> 14:19.726
Put your hand on your
hip like Errol Flynn.

14:19.759 --> 14:20.928
I'm gonna get you.
- Stop, Grandma.

14:20.961 --> 14:21.828
I surrender.

14:21.861 --> 14:22.963
Kill, kill, kill!

14:22.996 --> 14:23.931
Let me surrender!

14:23.964 --> 14:24.998
[laughing]

14:25.032 --> 14:25.899
Mom.

14:25.933 --> 14:27.367
Mom!
Mom!

14:27.400 --> 14:29.236
Mom!
What are you doing?

14:29.269 --> 14:30.803
Oh, oh, oh.

14:30.837 --> 14:32.572
Isn't it time for
your medication?

14:32.605 --> 14:34.241
Thank you.

14:34.274 --> 14:37.710
Thank you for reminding me.

14:37.744 --> 14:40.313
Here, Audrey, let me
get you a glass of water.

14:40.347 --> 14:43.516
Oh, my, I'd be
lost without you two.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.485
I'd hate to forget my pills.

14:55.929 --> 14:58.198
OK, I'm gonna
go take a shower.

15:02.135 --> 15:04.737
Hey, honey, where's
that big, white towel?

15:04.771 --> 15:07.240
It's in the linen cabinet.

15:07.274 --> 15:09.342
Only it's a gray towel now.

15:13.013 --> 15:15.082
I just can't believe it
when people don't see what's

15:15.115 --> 15:16.316
right in front of their face.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.566
Well, that was just marvelous.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.669
I don't remember the park
having that many flowers.

15:36.703 --> 15:39.339
Well, the last
time we went, uh--

15:39.372 --> 15:40.573
wait a minute.

15:40.607 --> 15:41.975
Have we ever been
to that park before?

15:44.777 --> 15:47.614
Oh, it was so relaxing
just being outdoors

15:47.647 --> 15:48.681
on a lovely spring day.

15:48.715 --> 15:50.650
Thank you very
much for taking me.

15:50.683 --> 15:52.785
Oh, I'm glad you
enjoyed it, Audrey.

15:52.819 --> 15:56.189
I'm gonna make
a nice pot of tea.

15:56.223 --> 15:57.190
See, Dan?

15:57.224 --> 15:58.825
I told you your mother
is totally fine.

15:58.858 --> 16:00.393
You just totally overreacted.

16:00.427 --> 16:03.696
Yeah, I gotta admit,
she was great today.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.465
Yeah, you know, the kids
were probably just playing

16:05.498 --> 16:07.100
in the garage, and
they turned the bike

16:07.134 --> 16:08.335
on and forgot to turn it off.

16:08.368 --> 16:09.836
Your mom had nothing
to do with it.

16:09.869 --> 16:11.638
Yeah, you're probably right.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.673
You know, what was I thinking?

16:13.706 --> 16:15.008
I don't know, but
you know, at least

16:15.042 --> 16:16.176
now, you don't have to worry.

16:16.209 --> 16:18.045
You can just relax and
enjoy your mom's visit.

16:18.078 --> 16:19.112
DAN: Yeah.

16:19.146 --> 16:20.347
I'm gonna go put
Jerry down for a nap.

16:31.758 --> 16:34.461
Dan, I made you s--

16:34.494 --> 16:37.830
[evil laughter]

16:58.618 --> 17:00.920
Wherever did you get
this lovely thing, dear?

17:00.953 --> 17:03.022
Look, look how it
looks like a rainbow

17:03.056 --> 17:05.725
with the lights coming through.

17:05.758 --> 17:06.993
Sure does.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.196
You always did love
art, didn't you, dear?

17:09.229 --> 17:10.130
I did?

17:13.733 --> 17:16.636
Darling, you remember
the lovely necklace

17:16.669 --> 17:19.005
that I promised you when
I was making macrame

17:19.038 --> 17:21.674
from the teabag strings.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.544
[choking]

17:25.645 --> 17:27.080
What is happening?

17:27.114 --> 17:28.548
Oh, just reminiscing.

17:28.581 --> 17:30.016
Art, art.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.584
Reminiscing my ass.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.120
That woman's trying to kill me.

17:33.153 --> 17:35.622
I'm telling you it was her
that shut that garage door.

17:35.655 --> 17:36.589
That's it!

17:36.623 --> 17:38.024
I'm calling the hospital.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.159
She's going back.

17:39.192 --> 17:40.360
Don't call the hospital, Dan.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.095
They can take away
any one of us.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.435
[humming]

17:48.468 --> 17:49.836
[grunt]

17:51.371 --> 17:54.474
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.

17:54.507 --> 17:57.510
I thought you were Dan.

17:57.544 --> 17:58.978
Audrey, what are you doing?

17:59.011 --> 18:02.582
Oh, I didn't get much
exercise at the hospital.

18:02.615 --> 18:05.185
OK, you're gonna
think this sounds crazy,

18:05.218 --> 18:08.688
you know, but Dan thinks
you're trying to kill him.

18:08.721 --> 18:11.324
Oh, no, dear, no.

18:11.358 --> 18:12.792
I'm not going to kill him.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.527
I'm going to bury him alive.

18:14.561 --> 18:16.263
[laugh]

18:17.697 --> 18:19.666
OK, I know you're kidding
when you say stuff like that,

18:19.699 --> 18:22.735
you know, but it's
really spooking Dan.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.237
Oh, yes, dear.

18:24.271 --> 18:26.639
I considered spooking
him to try to make him

18:26.673 --> 18:28.375
have another heart
attack, but then I

18:28.408 --> 18:30.377
knew I couldn't count on that.

18:30.410 --> 18:34.514
So you see, now I'm very
excited about burying him alive.

18:34.547 --> 18:35.848
[laugh]

18:37.317 --> 18:39.286
Now you're spooking me.

18:39.319 --> 18:40.487
No.

18:40.520 --> 18:44.724
Roseanne, Dan has to pay,
pay for locking me up.

18:44.757 --> 18:46.125
I was there for years.

18:46.159 --> 18:47.460
I was there for years.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.296
And I was stifled
and suffocated,

18:49.329 --> 18:51.398
and I was kept in the dark.

18:51.431 --> 18:57.103
And now, I've fallen in love
with the bury him alive plan.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.905
[laugh]

18:59.939 --> 19:01.574
No, you can't be serious.

19:01.608 --> 19:02.475
No!

19:02.509 --> 19:04.377
I am serious.

19:04.411 --> 19:07.113
Anyway, he's taken away my life,
now I'm gonna take away his.

19:07.146 --> 19:07.947
Oh!

19:11.017 --> 19:15.922
It's such a lovely night
for it, don't you think?

19:15.955 --> 19:17.390
Huh?

19:17.424 --> 19:19.359
OK, yeah, that's enough.

19:19.392 --> 19:20.860
OK now, give me the shov--

19:20.893 --> 19:21.928
No.

19:21.961 --> 19:23.129
No!

19:23.162 --> 19:24.464
I need this to whack him
on the head and stun him.

19:27.267 --> 19:29.736
Oh, but then-- then I'll
give you the shovel,

19:29.769 --> 19:33.540
and then you can help me
bury him alive if you'd like.

19:33.573 --> 19:36.175
Um, OK, that's enough talk
about burying Dan alive, OK?

19:36.209 --> 19:37.310
Just give me the shovel.

19:37.344 --> 19:38.245
No, no, no!

19:38.278 --> 19:39.912
Come on, give me
the damn shovel.

19:39.946 --> 19:40.947
Damn, why are you doing this?

19:40.980 --> 19:41.881
What is that?

19:41.914 --> 19:42.782
What is it?

19:42.815 --> 19:44.251
Oh my god.

19:44.284 --> 19:47.086
Audrey, you set
fire to Dan's boat?

19:47.119 --> 19:50.056
Yes, I did, because
it is Dan's boat.

19:50.089 --> 19:51.157
[screaming]

19:51.190 --> 19:54.494
I'm gonna destroy--
destroy all his things.

19:54.527 --> 19:58.465
And then I'm gonna destroy him.

19:58.498 --> 20:02.735
If I don't, he'll just put
me back in that hospital!

20:02.769 --> 20:05.004
Oh, why would he do that?

20:05.037 --> 20:06.673
You're well now.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.241
[screaming]

20:08.275 --> 20:09.141
Audrey!

20:09.175 --> 20:10.443
No!

20:10.477 --> 20:13.112
Audrey, what happened to
you out there in California?

20:13.145 --> 20:18.050
Did you have one too many
frozen mocha frappuccinos?

20:18.084 --> 20:19.519
Let go of my sock!

20:19.552 --> 20:20.953
Give my sock back!

20:30.463 --> 20:35.468
So cool of Grandma to
build us this barbecue pit.

20:35.502 --> 20:39.972
Yeah, I haven't had s'mores
since I was a Brownie.

20:40.006 --> 20:41.073
This is fun.

20:41.107 --> 20:44.210
Why don't you two go
get the Graham crackers?

20:44.243 --> 20:46.379
How are you doing
there, Audrey?

20:46.413 --> 20:48.981
Oh, just wonderful now that
they've tripled my dosage.

20:49.015 --> 20:50.249
I feel so much better.

20:52.719 --> 20:53.786
That's great.

20:53.820 --> 20:57.790
But, Mom, remember,
you gotta keep at it.

20:57.824 --> 20:59.326
Oh, don't worry, dear.

20:59.359 --> 21:01.328
No more trying to kill my Danny.

21:05.665 --> 21:06.899
OK, who's ready?

21:06.933 --> 21:09.201
Oh, I am, I am, I am.

21:09.235 --> 21:10.937
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.004
Oh, there.

21:12.038 --> 21:12.839
Mm.

21:16.175 --> 21:17.577
Delicious.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.546
Oh, this is so much
better than trying

21:19.579 --> 21:20.680
to make them with a hair dryer.

21:23.282 --> 21:26.986
I was just thinking
that same thing.

21:27.019 --> 21:27.887
Dan.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.221
Hm?

21:29.255 --> 21:32.759
Your mom's out of
her freaking mind.

21:32.792 --> 21:38.030
Roseanne, people with glass
mothers shouldn't throw stones.

21:38.064 --> 21:41.634
[theme music]
