Are we excited to go?

00:34.805 --> 00:35.838
Yes!

then this board has
the utmost respect

02:49.606 --> 02:51.774
for your bravery and heroism.
- Thank you, sir.

02:51.842 --> 02:55.694
Is it true you led four
civilians into enemy territory

02:55.762 --> 02:58.197
and extracted the area with
zero personnel casualties?

02:58.281 --> 02:59.498
Yes, sir.

02:59.583 --> 03:02.585
You engaged an enemy who
outnumbered and outarmed you,

03:02.652 --> 03:03.953
and you were victorious?

03:04.004 --> 03:05.337
Yes, sir.

03:05.422 --> 03:07.706
"Adapt and overcome,"

And you entered
hostile territory

on a decommissioned helicopter
that by most estimates would be

03:13.430 --> 03:16.565

Lieutenant Commander,
under most circumstances,

03:29.179 --> 03:31.780
I would be pinning a Silver Star
to your lapel.

03:31.848 --> 03:33.983
Unfortunately,

03:34.034 --> 03:37.620
those are not the circumstances

03:37.687 --> 03:42.158
Is there anything you'd like

03:42.209 --> 03:45.628
Lieutenant Commander McGarrett

No, no.

04:12.388 --> 04:14.223

04:14.274 --> 04:17.409

This is my fault, Joe.

04:44.921 --> 04:48.057
No, my actions
are my responsibility.

04:50.277 --> 04:52.978
So, how about you treat me
to a shrimp jambalaya

04:53.063 --> 04:54.730
and we will call it square.

04:54.781 --> 04:56.899

04:56.950 --> 04:58.784
You're the only man

as a fair trade

05:01.371 --> 05:03.605

you know that?

05:03.657 --> 05:05.791
Go ahead, take it.

05:05.875 --> 05:07.710
We'll talk over dinner.

05:20.724 --> 05:22.624
<i>What do we know?</i>

05:22.676 --> 05:25.077
Looks like a kidnapping, right?
We got 16 kids, three adults

05:25.145 --> 05:28.063
from South Shore Children's Academy;
they were on a field trip.

05:28.131 --> 05:30.065
Someone comes,
takes the whole bus.

05:30.133 --> 05:31.600
Parents been notified?

05:31.651 --> 05:33.602
Kono's on her way to
the school right now

05:33.653 --> 05:35.971
to meet them and prepare
them for a ransom call.

05:36.022 --> 05:39.158
Who's the vic, Chin?
Jay Katsu, driver of the bus.

05:39.242 --> 05:41.476
Still waiting on Max, but
the cause of death appears

05:41.578 --> 05:43.996
to be three gunshots
to the chest, close range.

05:44.080 --> 05:45.497
Here's what I think.

05:45.582 --> 05:47.649
All right, guy gets out of the
bus to see what's going on.

05:47.701 --> 05:50.586
Comes over here-- boom-- gets
popped by one of the kidnappers.

05:50.653 --> 05:53.339
Wait a minute.

05:59.079 --> 06:00.212
What are you thinking?

06:00.297 --> 06:01.997
This accident was staged.

06:02.048 --> 06:04.266
Look at this.
There's no skid marks.

06:04.334 --> 06:06.251
Neither of the airbags
have been deployed.

06:06.319 --> 06:07.803
There's minimal damage.

06:07.854 --> 06:09.605
Now who do these cars belong to?

06:09.672 --> 06:11.023
Well, HPD ran the plates.

06:11.107 --> 06:13.175
Turns out, both vehicles were
reported stolen last night.

06:13.226 --> 06:15.611
I just spoke to the witness
who called 911.

06:15.678 --> 06:17.346
She came on the accident
about 20 minutes ago.

06:17.397 --> 06:18.614
Driver was already dead.

06:18.681 --> 06:20.399
- She see the school bus?
- Yeah, she reported

06:20.467 --> 06:22.151
seeing one traveling at
high speeds, heading south.

06:22.202 --> 06:24.686
Well, if they reached the H3, they
could be anywhere on the island.

06:24.738 --> 06:26.622
All right, we need
the cell numbers

06:26.689 --> 06:28.523
of all the people on that bus.

06:28.575 --> 06:30.159
Pinging their phones is gonna be

06:30.210 --> 06:31.693
our best chance
of locating them.

06:35.382 --> 06:36.632
Everyone, put your phones
in the bag.

06:36.699 --> 06:37.716
Let's go!
Give me your phone.

06:37.801 --> 06:38.884
Phones in the bag!

06:38.968 --> 06:40.702
Let's go!

06:40.754 --> 06:43.305
I said now!
Phones in the bag.

06:43.373 --> 06:46.342
Got a phone?
Let's go.

06:48.428 --> 06:51.480
I said now!

06:51.547 --> 06:53.098
I said now!
Pick that up.

06:55.235 --> 06:58.854
Hey, you got a phone?
Phone in the bag!

06:58.905 --> 07:01.407
Let's go!
Come on, now.

07:02.325 --> 07:04.026
Let's go, now!

07:04.077 --> 07:05.811
Open the door.

07:12.452 --> 07:14.670
You! What do you think
you're doing?

07:14.737 --> 07:16.738
Today's not the day to be a hero.

07:26.771 --> 07:28.204
<i>Listen, are our kids okay?</i>

07:28.272 --> 07:30.006
<i>What do the kidnappers want?</i>

07:30.057 --> 07:33.359
We're not sure, but we are doing
everything necessary

07:33.444 --> 07:35.278
to prepare for a ransom call.

07:36.847 --> 07:40.033
I know that you want to do
everything you can to find

07:40.100 --> 07:43.620
your children, but the best
thing you can do right now

07:43.687 --> 07:46.322
is to make sure we have all of
your contact information

07:46.373 --> 07:49.159
in case the kidnappers call
any of you directly.

07:49.210 --> 07:51.077
We're gonna be setting
it up right here.

07:51.162 --> 07:53.246
Thank you very much.

07:56.717 --> 07:58.367
- Hey, you all right?
- Yeah.

07:58.419 --> 08:01.337
- Anything I can tell them?
- No, not yet.

08:02.640 --> 08:04.424
Listen, I need you to
conduct a background

08:04.508 --> 08:05.875
on every single one
of these parents.

08:05.926 --> 08:07.727
Why? You think it could be
about one of them?

08:07.812 --> 08:09.512
Kono, it could be
about all of them.

08:09.563 --> 08:11.181
I mean, this isn't a coincidence

08:11.232 --> 08:13.603
these guys hijacked a bus from
a high-priced private school.

08:13.604 --> 08:15.539
These kids-- they were targeted.

08:15.606 --> 08:17.106
We need to find out why.

08:17.158 --> 08:19.576
- All right?
- Yeah.

08:20.962 --> 08:23.747
Okay. Got it.

08:23.798 --> 08:25.882
All right. I just got off
the phone with HPD.

08:25.950 --> 08:27.717
They found a bag of cell
phones belonging to

08:27.785 --> 08:29.803
our victims dumped under
the Likelike overpass.

08:29.887 --> 08:31.605
Two highways intersect there,

08:31.672 --> 08:34.289
and there are six off-ramps
within three miles of that spot.

08:34.342 --> 08:36.977
Great, so we have no idea where they
are or what direction they are heading.

08:37.061 --> 08:39.645
The two stolen cars used at
the staged accidents--

08:39.730 --> 08:41.097
they were both carjackings.

08:41.148 --> 08:42.899
- We get a description on the perp?
- Better.

08:42.967 --> 08:44.267
I got a name.

08:44.318 --> 08:47.270
Ken Nakoa? We just put him away
for carjacking.

08:47.321 --> 08:49.472
Nice to see that our justice
system is following through.

08:49.523 --> 08:50.824
Yeah, he's out on bail.

08:50.908 --> 08:52.158
But he is wearing a
court-ordered ankle monitor.

08:52.243 --> 08:53.743
Okay, good.
We get a location?

08:53.811 --> 08:55.745
Probation officer's pulling
the tracking data now.

08:55.813 --> 08:57.163
This doesn't add up.

08:57.248 --> 08:59.032
Nakoa's a car thief with no
record of violent crimes.

08:59.116 --> 09:01.034
He doesn't fit the
profile of a kidnapper.

09:01.102 --> 09:02.469
No, no, he doesn't.
But he's a businessman.

09:02.536 --> 09:04.704
Maybe he worked for
the guys who did.

09:04.789 --> 09:08.174
Lieutenant Kelly. You have that
tracking data on Ken Nakoa?

09:08.259 --> 09:09.993
Yeah, great. Send it over.

09:10.044 --> 09:11.211
Nakoa's on the move.

09:18.335 --> 09:19.769
Okay, great. I got him.

09:19.837 --> 09:21.337
He's about a half mile
up the road.

09:21.389 --> 09:23.607
All right. Which one of those
trucks is he in?

09:23.674 --> 09:24.608
How do I know?

09:24.675 --> 09:26.810
What do you mean,
how do you know?

09:26.861 --> 09:27.777
You got the thing.

09:27.845 --> 09:29.679
I got a blinking red dot.

09:29.730 --> 09:30.847
That's all I got. See?

09:30.898 --> 09:32.649
Okay, so if you see anything
blinking red,

09:32.700 --> 09:34.484
go ahead and pull it over.
Why are you angry?

09:34.535 --> 09:36.486
- I'm not angry.
- Why would you be angry right now?

09:36.537 --> 09:39.456
- We're trying to get this guy.
- Continue, I'm going to get angry.

09:39.523 --> 09:41.908
Nakoa's got to be in one of
those trucks.

09:43.527 --> 09:45.028
How 'bout this one?

09:45.079 --> 09:46.162
Nope.

09:48.582 --> 09:49.866
Is that him?

09:49.917 --> 09:53.670
Not unless he's wearing
a Willie Nelson disguise.

10:00.311 --> 10:02.211
Okay, this has got to be him.

10:04.098 --> 10:07.233
- I hope this truck has good brakes.
- What? Why? Why do you hope...

10:15.392 --> 10:18.895
Hey, out, out, out, out.
Move, hands up, hands up.

10:18.946 --> 10:21.748
- Where's Nakoa?
- I don't know who that is.

10:23.501 --> 10:24.734
He's gotta be here somewhere.

10:24.785 --> 10:26.553
Go!

10:34.428 --> 10:35.762
Pineapples.

10:35.846 --> 10:38.131
Maybe he ditched the bracelet.

10:43.637 --> 10:46.556
Or maybe someone ditched Nakoa.

10:50.194 --> 10:52.062
Call his P.O., all right?
Get all the data

10:52.113 --> 10:54.597
off that tracking bracelet
for the last 48 hours.

10:54.648 --> 10:56.232
Nakoa crossed paths
with these kidnappers.

10:56.283 --> 10:58.284
I want to know where.

11:01.789 --> 11:03.540
Who is it?

11:03.607 --> 11:04.791
It's the ransom call.

11:04.875 --> 11:05.792
Chin.

11:05.876 --> 11:06.793
Call Kono,

11:06.877 --> 11:07.794
get a trace on it.

11:07.878 --> 11:08.795
Commander McGarrett?

11:08.879 --> 11:10.046
Yeah, I didn't catch your name.

11:10.114 --> 11:11.414
Oh, you can just call me

11:11.465 --> 11:14.467
the woman who's got
a gun pointed at 19 hostages.

11:14.552 --> 11:15.969
Have any of them been harmed?

11:16.053 --> 11:17.387
No, not yet.

11:17.454 --> 11:18.621
Good, let's keep it that way.

11:18.672 --> 11:20.289
What do you want?

11:20.341 --> 11:22.659
We want what's ours.

11:22.727 --> 11:25.145
The coke you took
in that bust at the harbor.

11:25.229 --> 11:27.063
We want it back.

11:27.131 --> 11:28.098
You have two hours

11:28.149 --> 11:30.016
to get it together...

11:31.135 --> 11:33.803
...or kids start dying.

11:35.906 --> 11:37.774
- Get it?
- Not enough time.

11:37.825 --> 11:39.075
What the hell is going on?

11:39.143 --> 11:42.162
This kidnapping has got nothing
to do with the parents.

11:43.531 --> 11:46.199
This kidnapping is about us.

11:53.100 --> 11:54.740
We want what's ours.

11:54.741 --> 11:57.192
The coke you took
in that bust at the harbor.

11:57.243 --> 11:58.193
We want it back.

11:58.244 --> 11:59.578
You have two hours

11:59.662 --> 12:01.530
to get it together,
Commander McGarrett,

12:01.581 --> 12:02.581
or kids start dying.

12:04.567 --> 12:06.735
How credible is that threat?

12:06.786 --> 12:07.953
They've already killed
one person, sir.

12:08.037 --> 12:09.087
I-I'm pretty sure
they're going to do

12:09.172 --> 12:10.739
whatever they feel
like they need

12:10.790 --> 12:12.674
to do to get their drugs back.
- Well, that's not gonna happen.

12:12.742 --> 12:14.042
We don't negotiate
with terrorists.

12:14.093 --> 12:15.210
Okay, but that's
what we're saying.

12:15.261 --> 12:17.846
I think we don't have
a choice, sir.

12:17.913 --> 12:20.215
If we give in to their demands,

12:20.266 --> 12:22.250
we are sending a message
that we're open for business.

12:22.302 --> 12:24.553
Today it's a bus,
tomorrow it's an airplane.

12:24.604 --> 12:25.854
Then what?
You need to find

12:25.921 --> 12:26.972
these kids some other way.

12:27.056 --> 12:28.273
What do you got
from the search teams?

12:28.358 --> 12:29.558
There's been
no sightings

12:29.609 --> 12:32.060
from helicopters, no
sightings from road blocks.

12:32.111 --> 12:34.095
We believe they might be
hiding the bus somewhere.

12:34.147 --> 12:35.614
What about the kidnappers--
what do we know about them?

12:35.698 --> 12:36.765
Nothing, nothing.

12:36.816 --> 12:38.200
HPD is still trying
to figure out

12:38.267 --> 12:39.735
which cartel
the drugs belong to.

12:39.786 --> 12:41.570
What about the harbor bust?
What about those guys?

12:41.621 --> 12:43.605
There were four hostiles on
the vessel when we engaged.

12:43.656 --> 12:44.939
One survived.
Mateo Vargas.

12:44.991 --> 12:47.743
He's in custody now,
but he is afraid for his life.

12:47.794 --> 12:49.911
Okay, my guess is that
he's not going to cooperate.

12:49.963 --> 12:52.497
Then make him.

12:52.582 --> 12:55.617
<i>We just need to ask you</i>
<i>a couple of questions</i>

12:55.668 --> 12:56.601
about the people you work for.

12:56.669 --> 12:57.669
Okay?

12:57.754 --> 12:58.720
Are you crazy?

12:58.788 --> 13:00.305
I'm not telling
you guys anything.

13:00.373 --> 13:02.007
Well, you don't really...

13:02.091 --> 13:03.392
you don't have a choice
in that matter.

13:03.459 --> 13:04.760
It's unfortunately, man.

13:04.811 --> 13:05.811
Guards!

13:07.347 --> 13:09.765
They're on a break, okay?

13:09.816 --> 13:11.183
Show some respect.

13:11.267 --> 13:13.485
Okay, what do you want?

13:17.357 --> 13:20.359
A busload of kids got
kidnapped this morning.

13:20.443 --> 13:21.610
What do you know
about that?

13:21.661 --> 13:24.196
Nothing.

13:24.280 --> 13:25.614
Don't lie to me.

13:25.665 --> 13:27.366
I swear to God,
I don't know nothing.

13:27.450 --> 13:28.617
I don't know nothing.

13:28.668 --> 13:31.286
Vargas, listen to me,
you got kids?

13:31.337 --> 13:32.788
Huh?

13:32.839 --> 13:34.989
- It's not a hard question-- you have kids?
- Yeah.

13:35.041 --> 13:36.625
How many?
Three, three.

13:36.676 --> 13:38.677
Three-- boys
or girls?

13:38.761 --> 13:39.828
Girls, I have
three girls.

13:39.879 --> 13:41.513
Okay, now imagine
your three girls

13:41.597 --> 13:43.164
are on that bus
that he's talking about.

13:43.216 --> 13:44.165
What would you do?

13:44.217 --> 13:47.469
What would
you do?

13:47.520 --> 13:49.554
I'm telling you,

13:49.639 --> 13:52.607
I don't know anything
about no kidnapping.

13:55.611 --> 13:57.396
Okay.

13:57.480 --> 13:59.731
Get up.

14:02.819 --> 14:05.037
Who do you work for?

14:07.240 --> 14:08.356
Hmm?

14:08.408 --> 14:09.491
I can't.

14:09.542 --> 14:11.326
Who you
working for?

14:11.377 --> 14:13.628
I can't tell you.

14:13.696 --> 14:15.697
He knows my family.

14:15.748 --> 14:18.199
He knows where they live.

14:18.251 --> 14:20.335
I swear, if I tell you that,
he'll kill them.

14:20.386 --> 14:22.721
Who, who's going
to kill 'em?

14:22.805 --> 14:24.005
Huh?

14:24.057 --> 14:25.206
I can't.

14:25.258 --> 14:27.542
All right. Okay, all right.

14:27.593 --> 14:28.927
Listen, we can get protection
for your family.

14:29.011 --> 14:30.178
You understand
what I'm saying?

14:30.229 --> 14:33.181
I swear to you
on my badge,

14:33.232 --> 14:35.233
I will get protection
for your family.

14:35.318 --> 14:36.685
You got to give
us a name.

14:36.736 --> 14:37.686
Okay?

14:37.737 --> 14:40.772
Okay.

14:40.857 --> 14:43.942
Hey, Lori, I need you to
find out everything you can

14:44.026 --> 14:45.427
about a guy named
Hugo Castillo.

14:45.495 --> 14:47.112
Vargas just ID'd him
as the head of the cartel.

14:47.180 --> 14:48.113
We find him, we find

14:48.197 --> 14:50.182
our kidnappers.

14:51.200 --> 14:54.002
Yeah.

14:54.069 --> 14:55.069
Joe.

14:55.121 --> 14:56.955
Hey, Steve.

14:57.039 --> 14:58.090
What are you
doing here?

14:58.174 --> 14:59.841
Recon.

14:59.909 --> 15:01.042
What are you talking
about, recon?

15:01.094 --> 15:02.461
I thought you were
gonna open a bar,

15:02.545 --> 15:05.764
embrace your
retirement.

15:05.848 --> 15:07.599
Wo Fat lured you to Korea,

15:07.683 --> 15:08.967
killed one of your people
just to find out

15:09.051 --> 15:09.968
what you know
about Shelburne,

15:10.052 --> 15:12.387
and the clock
is ticking, Steve.

15:12.438 --> 15:14.639
What's that got to do with
you being at Halawa today?

15:14.724 --> 15:16.525
We got to find Shelburne
before Wo Fat does,

15:16.592 --> 15:18.092
and I figure,
the only way to do that

15:18.144 --> 15:19.811
is talk to the people
closest to him.

15:19.896 --> 15:20.896
Who did you come
here to see?

15:20.947 --> 15:23.097
Hiro Noshimuri.

15:23.149 --> 15:24.579
Head of the local Yakuza--
I know, I put him here.

15:24.604 --> 15:25.700
Yeah, months ago,

15:25.701 --> 15:27.652
only now he's gone because
he got a couple good lawyers,

15:27.737 --> 15:29.771
got released, and he's working
on an extradition to Japan,

15:29.822 --> 15:30.906
so I got to go.

15:30.957 --> 15:32.958
I'll call you
when I find him.

15:39.048 --> 15:40.966
<i>He was a mid-level hit man</i>

15:41.050 --> 15:42.284
for the Tarza Cartel

15:42.351 --> 15:43.385
in Colombia.

15:43.452 --> 15:45.003
Nine months ago
he took out the higher-ups

15:45.087 --> 15:46.120
and he seized control.

15:46.172 --> 15:47.255
Well, I ran
Castillo's name

15:47.306 --> 15:49.591
through HPD,
and no hits on aliases

15:49.642 --> 15:51.176
or any known associates
on the island,

15:51.260 --> 15:52.627
so we have nothing
that tells us

15:52.678 --> 15:53.628
where they're
hiding those kids.

15:53.679 --> 15:54.930
Well, they only
had three days

15:54.981 --> 15:56.765
to put this plan together,
so they're going to pick

15:56.816 --> 15:58.183
a place they trust.
Vargas said

15:58.267 --> 16:00.318
Castillo's drugs are always
brought into the harbor

16:00.386 --> 16:01.786
and delivered to
the same place.

16:01.854 --> 16:03.104
Stash pad.

16:03.156 --> 16:04.322
- Right.
- Maybe that's where they're hiding the kids.

16:04.407 --> 16:05.857
Where are we

16:05.942 --> 16:07.308
on Nakoa's
ankle monitor?

16:07.360 --> 16:09.161
P.O. sent the raw data over,
I'm having it mapped now.

16:09.245 --> 16:11.696
Nakoa had to drop off
those stolen cars somewhere,

16:11.764 --> 16:13.147
and I'm hoping
that's the stash pad.

16:13.199 --> 16:14.332
We got to do
more than hope.

16:14.417 --> 16:16.701
We only have 45 minutes
until that next ransom call.

16:16.786 --> 16:18.770
Okay, maybe Vargas knows
where the stash pad is.

16:18.838 --> 16:20.005
Don't count on it.

16:20.072 --> 16:21.506
According to his statement,
his job was to sit

16:21.591 --> 16:23.458
on the product in the back
of a windowless van.

16:23.509 --> 16:25.343
So he has no idea
where it is.

16:25.428 --> 16:26.845
He's essentially a guard dog
with a gun--

16:26.929 --> 16:29.097
and not the smart
bomb-sniffing kind.

16:29.164 --> 16:30.331
Yeah, but even guard dogs
hear things,

16:30.383 --> 16:32.500
so unless Vargas is asleep
in the back of the van,

16:32.552 --> 16:34.052
he knows more
than he thinks he does.

16:35.104 --> 16:37.389
Where do you get
into the van?

16:37.473 --> 16:38.840
At the docks.

16:38.891 --> 16:41.359
The same docks
where we seized the cocaine?

16:41.444 --> 16:43.228
That's right.

16:43.312 --> 16:46.198
Look, if I
help you,

16:46.282 --> 16:49.017
how do I know
that my daughters are safe?

16:49.068 --> 16:51.686
Because Commander McGarrett
gave you his word.

16:53.072 --> 16:55.023
Look, we don't have

16:55.074 --> 16:56.208
that much time.

16:56.292 --> 16:57.692
I need you to remember.

16:57.743 --> 16:59.544
Do you always drop the drugs off
at the same place?

16:59.629 --> 17:00.545
Always.

17:00.630 --> 17:01.696
And when you leave
the docks,

17:01.747 --> 17:03.748
does the van turn left or right?

17:03.833 --> 17:06.468
I don't know.

17:06.535 --> 17:07.719
I never see where
we're going.

17:07.803 --> 17:08.869
There are no windows.

17:08.921 --> 17:11.039
Close your eyes.

17:11.089 --> 17:14.342
Take yourself
back there.

17:14.393 --> 17:15.810
Try to remember.

17:20.433 --> 17:21.549
Left, left,
I think.

17:21.601 --> 17:22.550
Okay.

17:22.602 --> 17:24.218
Good.

17:24.270 --> 17:26.104
How long is the ride?

17:27.156 --> 17:29.190
Um, 20, 25 minutes.

17:29.242 --> 17:32.694
Okay, good, think about
that 20 to 25 minutes.

17:32.745 --> 17:33.945
What do you hear,

17:34.030 --> 17:35.914
smell?

17:35.998 --> 17:38.250
What does it
feel like?

17:38.334 --> 17:40.452
We stopped a lot
in the beginning.

17:40.536 --> 17:42.704
Okay, traffic lights, good.

17:42.755 --> 17:43.705
What else?

17:43.756 --> 17:48.627
I hear pounding,
like metal on wood.

17:50.429 --> 17:52.914
Could the pounding have been
hammering, like construction?

17:52.965 --> 17:54.466
Yeah, yeah, that
sounds right.

17:54.550 --> 17:56.718
Yeah, they're doing
some renovations

17:56.769 --> 17:58.586
on the old fisherman's wharf.

17:58.638 --> 18:00.472
Okay, what do you remember next?

18:00.556 --> 18:05.443
Um... after that,
we go into a circle.

18:05.528 --> 18:06.394
On-ramp?

18:06.445 --> 18:07.762
Yeah, I think so,

18:07.813 --> 18:09.981
'cause we don't stop
for a while after that.

18:10.066 --> 18:10.982
About how long?

18:11.067 --> 18:15.153
Um, 15, 20 minutes?

18:15.237 --> 18:17.072
15 to 20 minutes, okay.

18:18.240 --> 18:21.609
Did it seem like
you were climbing in altitude?

18:21.661 --> 18:23.161
Going uphill?

18:23.245 --> 18:24.412
Yeah, uphill

18:24.463 --> 18:25.446
for no more

18:25.498 --> 18:26.831
than ten minutes
and then we arrived.

18:26.916 --> 18:27.966
Can you hear the ocean?

18:28.050 --> 18:29.784
No.

18:29.835 --> 18:31.619
No, I heard,
uh, traffic,

18:31.671 --> 18:33.805
a freeway maybe

18:33.889 --> 18:35.890
in the distance.

18:38.060 --> 18:40.011
I'm sorry,
is any of this helping?

18:40.096 --> 18:43.264
Yeah, you're doing great.

18:43.316 --> 18:44.399
So I got the tracking data
from Nakoa's P.O.

18:44.467 --> 18:46.017
This is everywhere he's been

18:46.102 --> 18:47.635
in the past 48 hours.

18:47.687 --> 18:49.654
- Very busy guy.
- Yeah, right?

18:49.739 --> 18:51.022
Now, the cars used
in the kidnapping were stolen

18:51.107 --> 18:52.324
here and here.

18:52.391 --> 18:54.442
Any of these other locations
could be the stash pad.

18:54.493 --> 18:55.977
Okay, well,
we definitely

18:56.028 --> 18:57.495
don't have time to check out
all these places.

18:57.580 --> 18:59.831
Have HPD recon
these locations, okay,

18:59.915 --> 19:01.533
and then tell 'em to keep
their eyes open for buildings

19:01.617 --> 19:02.701
big enough to hide a bus.

19:02.785 --> 19:05.020
Steve, one of the parents
is here to see you.

19:05.087 --> 19:07.706
Okay, thank you.

19:13.346 --> 19:16.164
The other parents
asked me to come.

19:16.215 --> 19:18.516
We know you've received
a ransom call,

19:18.601 --> 19:22.303
so what do the kidnappers want?

19:22.355 --> 19:24.973
Mr. Schafer, I can assure you
that we have every resource

19:25.024 --> 19:26.841
on the island working
to bring your kids back.

19:26.892 --> 19:28.176
How much did they ask for?

19:28.227 --> 19:30.028
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

19:31.147 --> 19:34.115
They have our kids
and they want our money.

19:34.183 --> 19:35.533
How much more simple can it be?

19:35.618 --> 19:37.736
If we thought that would
work, we would do that.

19:37.820 --> 19:39.704
Is there something
you're not telling me?

19:39.789 --> 19:41.072
- Mr. Schafer...
- If it's not about the money,

19:41.157 --> 19:42.857
then what is it about?

19:42.908 --> 19:45.193
Mr. Schafer,

19:45.244 --> 19:46.360
listen...

19:46.412 --> 19:48.362
I know this is
really hard

19:48.414 --> 19:50.498
and I'm sorry,
but you're just going

19:50.549 --> 19:52.033
to have to trust us on this.

19:56.555 --> 19:58.556
Yeah.

19:59.675 --> 20:01.593
Jason...

20:01.677 --> 20:03.878
wanted me to take him
surfing this morning.

20:03.929 --> 20:05.930
He's just learning,
it's all he can think about.

20:06.982 --> 20:09.150
I told him I couldn't go.

20:09.218 --> 20:11.236
I had to go
into the office early.

20:13.606 --> 20:16.574
I chose paperwork over my son
because I assumed

20:16.659 --> 20:17.859
I'd have a thousand
other mornings

20:17.910 --> 20:19.560
where I could go
surfing with him.

20:20.946 --> 20:24.115
So, please, just g-give them
whatever they want

20:24.200 --> 20:26.901
and bring my boy home.

20:26.952 --> 20:29.721
<i>Everything will be fine, Adam.</i>

20:29.789 --> 20:31.840
Go back to New York;
you have a business to run.

20:31.907 --> 20:33.958
Extradition to Japan.

20:34.043 --> 20:36.294
Is that really
what you want?

20:36.378 --> 20:38.379
Yes, I'll be safer there.

20:38.431 --> 20:39.881
Safe from what?

20:39.932 --> 20:42.416
You don't have to run.

20:42.468 --> 20:44.469
I'm afraid I do.

20:49.842 --> 20:52.393
Who is it?

20:52.445 --> 20:54.195
Who's making
you do this?

20:54.263 --> 20:55.429
Yakuza?

20:56.816 --> 20:58.783
It's unimportant.

20:58.868 --> 21:00.902
Look, I made
a promise

21:00.953 --> 21:03.905
not to make
my business yours.

21:03.956 --> 21:06.624
Now I need you
to promise me the same.

21:10.963 --> 21:13.548
Going down?

21:13.615 --> 21:14.782
Get in.

21:14.834 --> 21:18.586
Mr. Noshimuri,
don't make me ask you twice.

21:18.637 --> 21:20.588
No,

21:20.639 --> 21:22.640
just your father.

21:25.644 --> 21:27.461
It's okay.

21:30.232 --> 21:31.649
Lori, Lori!

21:31.734 --> 21:33.568
- Yeah, tracing it now.
- Danny.

21:38.691 --> 21:41.526
This is McGarrett.

21:41.610 --> 21:42.694
You have my coke?

21:42.778 --> 21:44.812
I need proof the
kids are okay.

21:44.864 --> 21:45.947
That's not an answer.

21:45.998 --> 21:47.365
We're not going
to give you anything

21:47.449 --> 21:48.917
until we know those
kids are safe.

21:48.984 --> 21:50.651
Oh, you want proof?

21:50.703 --> 21:54.289
Okay, I'll give you proof.

21:54.340 --> 21:56.040
Bring me one of them.

21:56.125 --> 21:57.876
Wait, what
are you doing?

21:57.960 --> 21:58.676
You!

21:58.761 --> 21:59.827
Come on.

21:59.879 --> 22:01.162
Now!

22:01.213 --> 22:03.214
Let's go!

22:06.501 --> 22:08.520
I think my dad knows that guy.

22:08.604 --> 22:09.521
Let's go!

22:10.723 --> 22:11.973
No, no.

22:12.024 --> 22:13.491
Hey, what are you doing?
Hey, hey.

22:13.559 --> 22:15.360
Okay, just stop.
Listen to me.

22:15.444 --> 22:17.362
Listen to me.
Don't do anything stupid, okay?

22:17.446 --> 22:18.679
We're right here.

22:18.731 --> 22:19.513
You said you wanted

22:19.565 --> 22:21.533
proof the hostages were alive.

22:23.536 --> 22:24.953
Hear those screams?

22:25.020 --> 22:27.521
That's your proof.

22:27.573 --> 22:30.124
I want my coke in a truck,

22:30.192 --> 22:31.659
lights flashing,
headed north

22:31.710 --> 22:33.461
on Kam Highway.

22:33.528 --> 22:35.129
One driver, no tails,
no helicopters.

22:35.197 --> 22:37.298
When I see you on the road,
I'll call you.

22:37.366 --> 22:38.800
You have one hour.

22:38.867 --> 22:40.835
A second longer,
and I shoot a kid.

22:40.886 --> 22:41.886
Do you understand?

22:41.971 --> 22:43.037
Yes, I understand.

22:43.088 --> 22:44.038
Listen, hey, hey, hey...

22:45.591 --> 22:46.874
Location?

22:46.926 --> 22:48.393
No, not enough time.
She's bouncing the call

22:48.477 --> 22:49.978
off four different towers.
It's on the windward side.

22:50.045 --> 22:52.513
Notify HPD, have them
send all their people over

22:52.565 --> 22:53.731
to that side of the island.
- Okay.

22:53.816 --> 22:55.049
Hey. I think we got something.

22:55.100 --> 22:56.801
Yeah, between Nakoa's
tracking data

22:56.869 --> 22:58.052
and everything
Vargas remembered,

22:58.103 --> 22:59.387
we think we've
narrowed a location.

22:59.438 --> 23:01.356
That's got to be where
they're holding the kids.

23:01.423 --> 23:02.557
What is at that location?

23:02.625 --> 23:03.891
It's at a warehouse.

23:03.943 --> 23:04.909
It's an old cannery.

23:04.994 --> 23:06.644
And it looks big enough
to hide a bus.

23:06.712 --> 23:08.479
All right, let's
move, let's go.

23:18.424 --> 23:19.707
That's the bus.

23:40.262 --> 23:41.779
Where are they?

23:57.185 --> 23:58.502
What is that?

23:58.503 --> 24:00.504
Not sure.

24:03.308 --> 24:04.791
Who was sitting there?

24:06.511 --> 24:09.051
Ms. Christie.
The teacher.

24:09.052 --> 24:10.969
- Find anything?
- Bunch of false- bottom fish crates.

24:11.020 --> 24:12.104
Same ones the
cartel used

24:12.171 --> 24:14.139
to smuggle the drugs
we found at the harbor.

24:14.190 --> 24:16.274
All right, well, I found, uh,
fresh motor oil over here.

24:16.342 --> 24:17.776
I think they had
a second vehicle.

24:17.843 --> 24:19.344
We found a note tucked into
the teacher's seat.

24:19.395 --> 24:21.279
"Jason Schafer remembers seeing

24:21.347 --> 24:23.615
one of the kidnappers
talking to his father."

24:23.682 --> 24:24.483
Schafer.
Isn't that the father

24:24.534 --> 24:25.617
that came to
talk to you?

24:25.684 --> 24:27.319
Yes. Malcolm Schafer.

24:27.370 --> 24:28.570
How does Schafer know
one of the kidnappers?

24:28.654 --> 24:30.706
Maybe he was the one
who was targeted all along.

24:30.790 --> 24:31.856
All right,
hold on, hold on.

24:31.908 --> 24:33.458
So the kidnappers have
a beef with him; I get it.

24:33.526 --> 24:35.193
They take his kid, but
why the rest of the class?

24:35.244 --> 24:36.528
Chin, get everything
you can on this guy.

24:36.579 --> 24:38.630
All right, Danny, you and Kono
go to the school, talk to him.

24:38.697 --> 24:40.832
Let's do it quick.
We're running out of time.

24:40.883 --> 24:43.251
- Where you going?
- I'm gonna work on plan B.

24:46.055 --> 24:47.139
Where is this guy?

24:47.206 --> 24:48.824
He's not here.

24:48.891 --> 24:50.976
What about his wife?

24:51.043 --> 24:52.194
Over there.

24:54.063 --> 24:55.397
Mrs. Schafer.

24:55.481 --> 24:58.066
Mrs. Schafer,
we need to speak

24:58.134 --> 24:59.651
to your husband.
- Do you know where he is?

24:59.718 --> 25:02.487
Why?

25:02.555 --> 25:03.705
Did something happen?

25:03.773 --> 25:04.740
Is Jason okay?

25:04.824 --> 25:06.241
Mrs. Schafer, we have
reason to believe

25:06.325 --> 25:08.243
that your son maybe recognized
one of the kidnappers.

25:08.327 --> 25:09.561
What?

25:09.612 --> 25:11.530
Why... how would my son
know one of the kidnappers?

25:11.581 --> 25:13.398
That's what we're trying
to find out.

25:13.449 --> 25:15.250
We think Jason might have seen

25:15.334 --> 25:17.319
this person with your husband.
If you can think of anything--

25:17.386 --> 25:18.787
I don't know,
maybe a business associate

25:18.871 --> 25:19.921
that he might have recently

25:20.006 --> 25:20.922
had a conflict with?

25:21.007 --> 25:22.707
No, that's-that's not possible.

25:22.759 --> 25:24.709
Mrs. Schafer, what line of work
is your husband in?

25:24.761 --> 25:26.211
He's in real estate.

25:26.262 --> 25:27.429
Okay, we need
to speak to him now,

25:27.513 --> 25:28.713
so it'd really be helpful
if you could

25:28.765 --> 25:29.881
tell us where he is.

25:29.932 --> 25:31.216
Uh, he got a phone call,

25:31.267 --> 25:32.267
he had to step away.

25:32.351 --> 25:33.268
Okay, when?

25:33.352 --> 25:34.919
A little while ago.

25:35.938 --> 25:37.606
- Anything?
- No.

25:37.690 --> 25:38.807
He's not here.

25:38.891 --> 25:40.192
His kid's missing,
everyone else is here;

25:40.259 --> 25:41.476
Why would he leave?

25:41.561 --> 25:43.745
We need to run his phone,
find out who he was talking to.

25:43.813 --> 25:46.097
<i>There's got to be another way.</i>
<i>What about a decoy?</i>

25:46.149 --> 25:47.399
<i>No, sir, that won't work.</i>

25:47.450 --> 25:50.152
If they test the drugs at
the drop, these kids are dead.

25:50.236 --> 25:51.820
You can't tell me
you have no other leads.

25:51.888 --> 25:53.738
Oh, we do have another lead,
but we can't find him.

25:53.790 --> 25:55.040
We're running out of time.

25:55.108 --> 25:56.792
If I release those drugs
and something goes wrong,

25:56.876 --> 25:58.809
that's $80 million in cocaine
back on the streets.

25:58.834 --> 25:59.461
Okay.

25:59.462 --> 26:01.713
Sir, with all due respect,
you're running out of options.

26:01.780 --> 26:04.249
Excuse me?

26:04.300 --> 26:06.251
These people have already shown
that they're willing to kill.

26:06.302 --> 26:08.587
If we don't negotiate,
I believe they will not hesitate

26:08.638 --> 26:10.388
to murder every person
on that bus.

26:10.456 --> 26:11.556
I agree with her, sir.

26:11.624 --> 26:13.675
We just need the
drugs as bait.

26:13.759 --> 26:15.310
What makes you think
if you deliver

26:15.394 --> 26:16.461
they'll release the hostages?

26:19.348 --> 26:20.298
We don't.

26:20.349 --> 26:21.733
But right now,
it's the only way

26:21.800 --> 26:23.902
we can buy enough time
to find those kids.

26:52.548 --> 26:54.666
Danny and Lori,
you guys in position?

26:54.717 --> 26:55.667
In position.

26:55.718 --> 26:56.718
I'm two minutes out.

26:56.802 --> 26:58.002
Chin, how's the signal?

26:58.054 --> 27:00.438
Tracker's up. Loud and clear.

27:04.143 --> 27:05.843
I'm on the way.

27:05.895 --> 27:07.028
Where are the kids?

27:07.113 --> 27:09.114
You hold up your end,
I'll hold up mine.

27:09.181 --> 27:11.182
Get off the highway.

27:11.234 --> 27:12.484
Head north on Plantation Road.

27:12.535 --> 27:14.486
Two miles up,
there will be a white van.

27:14.537 --> 27:17.405
Put our drugs in the van
and drive away.

27:17.490 --> 27:20.125
I'll call you then
with further instructions.

27:27.800 --> 27:30.168
I got a positive ID on the van.

27:30.219 --> 27:31.753
Find anything else?

27:31.837 --> 27:34.005
Negative.

27:34.056 --> 27:35.724
It's all clear here.

27:53.392 --> 27:57.078
I'm heading to the van now.

28:25.474 --> 28:27.142
♪ ♪

28:31.280 --> 28:34.215
All right.

28:34.283 --> 28:36.234
I'm heading back.

28:36.285 --> 28:38.737
Hold on, Steve.

28:38.788 --> 28:40.405
There's something's wrong
with the tracking signal.

28:40.456 --> 28:41.957
Picking up some sort
of interference.

28:42.041 --> 28:43.124
You see any radio towers

28:43.209 --> 28:44.793
in the area?

28:48.331 --> 28:49.748
No.

28:49.799 --> 28:51.750
No, there's nothing here
but the van.

28:51.801 --> 28:52.751
Something's not right.

28:52.802 --> 28:54.085
Get out of there now.

29:26.446 --> 29:27.454
You okay?

29:27.455 --> 29:28.522
What the hell happened?

29:28.607 --> 29:29.857
They rigged the van.

29:29.941 --> 29:31.108
Geez.

29:31.176 --> 29:32.393
They give you the
kids' location?

29:32.477 --> 29:33.694
No.

29:33.778 --> 29:35.145
I don't get it.

29:35.196 --> 29:36.363
I mean, we gave them
what they wanted.

29:36.448 --> 29:37.865
Why blow up their own drugs?

29:37.949 --> 29:39.617
Hold on, maybe somebody else
rigged the van.

29:39.684 --> 29:41.619
No, they did it.
And they didn't just

29:41.686 --> 29:44.705
blow up the drugs,
they blew up our evidence.

29:44.789 --> 29:46.073
Hold on.

29:46.157 --> 29:48.042
Destroying evidence
makes sense if we have

29:48.126 --> 29:49.043
a high-value
suspect in custody.

29:49.127 --> 29:50.294
But that bust we
made at the docks,

29:50.361 --> 29:52.046
we didn't get anybody
worth this much trouble.

29:52.130 --> 29:53.297
Or did we?

29:53.364 --> 29:54.498
Who, Vargas?

29:54.549 --> 29:56.634
No, he's low-level security
for the cartel.

29:56.701 --> 29:59.253
Maybe he's not.

30:02.507 --> 30:04.592
Where are the kids, man?

30:04.676 --> 30:07.678
I told you, I don't know

30:07.729 --> 30:09.430
nothing about
no bus or no kids.

30:09.514 --> 30:10.514
Listen to me.

30:10.565 --> 30:12.766
Nobody blows up
$80 million worth of cocaine

30:12.834 --> 30:15.269
to save the schmuck that sits
in the back of the van.

30:15.353 --> 30:16.937
Hey, where are
the kids?!

30:17.022 --> 30:18.439
Come on!

30:18.523 --> 30:19.690
We're done here!
Where are they?!

30:19.741 --> 30:21.191
You're saying
that the drugs are gone?

30:23.695 --> 30:26.697
Then you got no case against me.

30:26.748 --> 30:29.199
Damn.

30:29.250 --> 30:30.701
That's not good for you.

30:30.752 --> 30:35.289
Well, now there's no way
you're getting those kids back.

30:35.373 --> 30:37.374
Huh?

30:39.077 --> 30:41.045
You're Castillo.

30:43.081 --> 30:45.432
To be fair, I did warn you.

30:45.517 --> 30:48.018
Castillo is ruthless.

30:51.556 --> 30:52.389
Go ahead.

30:52.440 --> 30:53.557
Go ahead. Come on.

30:57.312 --> 30:58.696
Where are the kids?

30:58.763 --> 31:01.115
I promise you,
I promise you,

31:01.199 --> 31:02.265
you are not leaving this room

31:02.317 --> 31:03.534
until you tell us
where those kids are.

31:03.601 --> 31:05.953
I don't think that's true.

31:06.037 --> 31:09.456
I think my lawyer's
coming here to get me out.

31:09.541 --> 31:12.626
No. I think I'm done
answering questions for today.

31:12.711 --> 31:14.078
I think I'm going home.

31:14.129 --> 31:15.579
Gonna go see my boys.

31:16.614 --> 31:17.798
- Boys?
- Yeah.

31:17.882 --> 31:19.249
You said you had girls.
Said you had three girls.

31:19.300 --> 31:20.283
I did say that, didn't I?

31:20.335 --> 31:21.752
Must have been mistaken.
Yeah.

31:21.803 --> 31:22.753
Let me talk to him
for one second.

31:22.804 --> 31:23.754
Just one second.

31:23.805 --> 31:25.089
One second.

31:29.260 --> 31:30.177
Come on.

31:30.261 --> 31:32.479
Huh?

31:32.564 --> 31:34.765
Let me tell you something.

31:34.816 --> 31:35.766
Look at me.

31:35.817 --> 31:37.401
Yeah.

31:37.468 --> 31:38.969
I don't care who you are.

31:39.020 --> 31:40.320
I don't care if you're

31:40.405 --> 31:42.573
Vargas or Castillo;
we don't get those kids back,

31:42.640 --> 31:44.525
there's gonna be a toe tag
hanging off your foot

31:44.609 --> 31:45.993
that's gonna say "John Doe."

31:46.077 --> 31:48.162
We'll see.

31:54.152 --> 31:55.703
Kids, don't look at that.
Look at me.

31:55.787 --> 31:57.121
Someone's going to find us.

31:58.156 --> 31:59.456
We're going to be okay,
all right?

32:02.677 --> 32:03.877
All right, what is this?

32:03.962 --> 32:05.295
Get your heads down!

32:05.346 --> 32:06.930
Get your heads down, girls!

32:06.998 --> 32:08.282
Cover up, cover up!

32:08.349 --> 32:09.466
Get in the corner! Back up!

32:09.517 --> 32:11.435
Back away from the vents!

32:16.174 --> 32:17.558
Open!

32:21.446 --> 32:23.013
Hey, guys.

32:23.064 --> 32:24.782
I got something.

32:24.849 --> 32:27.317
Remember that anonymous tip
we got three days ago?

32:27.368 --> 32:28.318
Yeah.

32:28.369 --> 32:29.453
It was Schafer.

32:30.371 --> 32:31.572
What are you talking about?

32:31.656 --> 32:33.023
The call that led
to the drug bust,

32:33.074 --> 32:35.125
it came from a pay phone
on the North Shore right across

32:35.193 --> 32:36.160
the street from
Schafer's office.

32:36.211 --> 32:38.378
So I ran a voice analysis,

32:38.463 --> 32:39.913
comparing the call

32:39.998 --> 32:42.332
with Schafer's outgoing
voice mail message.

32:42.383 --> 32:44.835
A large shipment of cocaine
will be arriving tonight.

32:44.886 --> 32:46.804
- It's a match.
- Wait.

32:46.871 --> 32:48.555
Why does Schafer know
about a drug shipment?

32:48.640 --> 32:50.507
Because he's in business
with Castillo.

32:50.558 --> 32:52.392
He's got a shell company
he's been using

32:52.477 --> 32:53.927
to lease out one
of his properties

32:54.012 --> 32:55.545
to the cartel as a stash pad.

32:55.597 --> 32:56.930
That's where we found the bus.

32:57.015 --> 32:59.049
Okay, so Schafer's
Castillo's landlord, right?

32:59.100 --> 33:00.851
Let say
they were in business together.

33:00.902 --> 33:02.402
Why would he be making
this anonymous call?

33:02.487 --> 33:03.403
Who knows?
Doesn't matter.

33:03.488 --> 33:04.855
Relationship went south,
they had a beef.

33:04.906 --> 33:07.741
Castillo-- he leverages a bunch
of kids to get his drugs back.

33:07.826 --> 33:09.359
He gets payback with Schafer.

33:09.410 --> 33:10.778
Two birds, one stone.

33:10.862 --> 33:11.829
We got to find Schafer.

33:11.896 --> 33:14.531
We get anything?

33:14.582 --> 33:16.867
I found a phone registered
to Schafer's shell corporation,

33:16.918 --> 33:18.068
and I pulled the records.

33:18.119 --> 33:19.553
Turns out he's been
getting calls

33:19.621 --> 33:21.388
from an unlisted number
all day long.

33:21.456 --> 33:22.840
I think it's from
the kidnappers.

33:22.907 --> 33:24.625
And he got a text
about an hour ago.

33:24.709 --> 33:27.461
"Hawaiian Cement. 2:00 p.m.
Your son wants to see you.

33:27.545 --> 33:29.680
Come alone."
That's why he left the school.

33:29.747 --> 33:31.465
He's meeting them right now.

33:34.936 --> 33:36.970
Hello?

33:37.055 --> 33:39.690
Hello!

33:39.757 --> 33:41.809
<i>Hello!</i>

33:46.231 --> 33:47.564
Where's my son?

33:47.615 --> 33:48.816
Where's Jason?

33:48.900 --> 33:50.534
Didn't think you'd show.

33:50.601 --> 33:51.935
You said if I came alone,

33:51.986 --> 33:52.953
you'd let the kids go.

33:53.037 --> 33:54.121
You should have
thought of that

33:54.205 --> 33:55.706
before you called in
that anonymous tip.

33:55.773 --> 33:57.107
Yeah, well, you didn't tell me

33:57.158 --> 33:58.575
you were going to be moving
drugs out of my warehouse.

33:58.626 --> 33:59.326
We had a deal.

33:59.410 --> 34:00.627
Please, just...

34:00.712 --> 34:02.246
do whatever you want with me.

34:02.297 --> 34:03.997
Just let the kids go.

34:04.082 --> 34:06.333
Sorry. It's too late for that.

34:06.417 --> 34:08.168
What?

34:08.253 --> 34:09.469
What did you do?

34:09.554 --> 34:11.170
What I had to.

34:14.141 --> 34:15.259
Move!

34:29.741 --> 34:32.025
Drop your weapon!

34:32.110 --> 34:34.061
Right now!

34:40.618 --> 34:42.235
Hey, I'm going after Schafer.

35:32.136 --> 35:34.221
Hey! Hey! Hands up.

35:34.305 --> 35:35.555
Please.

35:35.640 --> 35:37.874
You have
to help me find my son.

36:02.367 --> 36:03.750
I hate heroes.

36:13.044 --> 36:14.127
Where are the kids?

36:16.914 --> 36:18.465
Where are they?

36:18.549 --> 36:19.766
Tell us where
the kids are.

36:26.808 --> 36:30.060
You hear that?

36:42.156 --> 36:44.074
It's them!

36:44.125 --> 36:45.625
Lori, kill that conveyor.

37:04.345 --> 37:06.146
Watch your back.

37:23.814 --> 37:26.416
Go, Chin!

37:37.295 --> 37:38.462
All right, stop!

37:42.717 --> 37:44.718
Get us out!

38:10.495 --> 38:12.412
They're all alive.

38:36.237 --> 38:38.721
Come on, kids,
step down carefully.

38:40.074 --> 38:42.275
Thank God
you're safe.

38:43.861 --> 38:45.328
Mom.

38:45.396 --> 38:48.582
Oh, son, I'm so
glad you're home.

38:49.867 --> 38:51.668
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

38:56.591 --> 38:57.791
Dad.

38:57.859 --> 39:00.677
Mmm.

39:22.783 --> 39:24.651
Came to see me off.

39:24.735 --> 39:27.070
- How kind.
- No, uh, actually,

39:27.121 --> 39:29.272
we found out you're gonna be
hanging out a little bit longer

39:29.323 --> 39:30.574
- than you thought.
- Yeah.

39:30.625 --> 39:32.742
We dug up a little new evidence.

39:37.281 --> 39:38.632
Yeah, that's him.

39:38.716 --> 39:40.250
That's Hugo Castillo.

39:41.785 --> 39:43.170
All right.

39:43.254 --> 39:45.505
I'll take the rest
of your statement inside.

39:45.590 --> 39:46.723
- You're a dead man!
- Easy.

39:46.790 --> 39:48.592
You're a dead man.

39:48.643 --> 39:50.177
And you are under arrest,
my friend.

39:50.261 --> 39:51.344
Book 'em, Danno.

39:51.429 --> 39:52.729
Gonna start with that again?

39:52.796 --> 39:54.797
Huh?

40:05.142 --> 40:07.327
Hey.

40:07.411 --> 40:09.029
You okay?

40:09.113 --> 40:10.664
Your text said
it was urgent.

40:10.748 --> 40:12.749
Something you need
to hear.

40:16.704 --> 40:18.488
What the hell are
you doing, Joe?

40:18.539 --> 40:20.257
You were supposed to call me
when you found him.

40:20.324 --> 40:22.092
Yeah, well,
you were a little busy.

40:22.159 --> 40:24.994
And we needed to know what
Wo Fat knows about Shelburne.

40:26.130 --> 40:27.631
Tell him what

40:27.682 --> 40:29.432
you told m

40:29.500 --> 40:31.885
All of this time, McGarrett,

40:31.969 --> 40:34.104
you've been asking
the wrong questions.

40:34.188 --> 40:36.506
What's he talking about?

40:36.557 --> 40:38.608
Shelburne is not
a thing or a place.

40:38.676 --> 40:41.811
It's a person, and Wo Fat's
very close to finding him.

40:41.862 --> 40:44.847
Who? Who-Who is Shelburne?

40:44.899 --> 40:46.616
I don't know.

40:46.684 --> 40:49.786
Just someone that Wo Fat fears,
and Wo Fat fears no one.

40:49.853 --> 40:52.572
For that reason,

40:52.657 --> 40:54.874
he won't rest
until Shelburne is dead.

40:57.578 --> 40:58.962
Here.

41:00.715 --> 41:01.965
What, you believe him?

41:02.032 --> 41:03.199
I do.

41:03.251 --> 41:04.467
Where are you going, Joe?

41:04.552 --> 41:06.419
Going to find Shelburne.

41:19.550 --> 41:20.684
It's me.

41:20.735 --> 41:22.185
We got a problem.

41:22.236 --> 41:24.154
Steve is getting too close.

41:24.221 --> 41:26.523
We're gonna have to move you.
