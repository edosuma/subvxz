WEBVTT

00:16.584 --> 00:18.252
Morning, Mr. Jintao.

00:18.286 --> 00:20.154
We're prepped and
ready for departure.

00:20.188 --> 00:22.390
Careful, Paul.

00:22.423 --> 00:24.158
You get ahead of yourself.

00:24.192 --> 00:27.728
Of course, standing by for
your final approval, as always.

00:27.761 --> 00:30.131
I think you'll find everything
up to Mr. Chen's standards.

00:30.164 --> 00:31.432
I hope so.

00:31.465 --> 00:34.802
Mr. Chen's en route.

00:34.835 --> 00:36.337
We can't afford a delay.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.472
There is one issue
I should mention.

00:38.506 --> 00:40.241
A revision to the crew list.

00:40.274 --> 00:42.410
Uh, my copilot is out

00:42.443 --> 00:44.278
with a case of food poisoning.

00:44.312 --> 00:45.646
Bad salmon.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.315
So you know.

00:47.348 --> 00:49.450
I vetted the substitute myself.

00:49.483 --> 00:51.752
Jenkins, yes.
Then he's already cleared?

00:51.785 --> 00:53.721
Mr. Chen signed off
on him last night.

00:53.754 --> 00:55.456
Wonderful.

00:55.489 --> 00:56.824
Jenkins.

00:56.857 --> 01:01.629
Looking forward to flying
with you, Mr. Jintao.

01:05.766 --> 01:08.102
(phone ringing)

01:11.439 --> 01:12.740
Yeah, Leon.

01:12.773 --> 01:15.776
Gibbs,
Operation Willoughby is a go.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.212
(phone snaps shut)

01:21.715 --> 01:23.717
*

01:53.947 --> 01:56.750
BISHOP: You didn't tell me
you were working with NSA.

01:56.784 --> 01:59.253
QASIM: It's a joint
surveillance with NCIS.

01:59.287 --> 02:01.289
They call it
"suspicious chatter."

02:01.322 --> 02:02.856
Ah, you like that, huh?
(laughs)

02:02.890 --> 02:05.559
Yes, because when
I say that, you see me

02:05.593 --> 02:07.561
like a sexy spy.
(both laugh)

02:07.595 --> 02:08.862
You're right.

02:08.896 --> 02:11.532
I'm translating
boring conversations.

02:11.565 --> 02:14.735
My supervisor asked if there
could be a double meaning

02:14.768 --> 02:15.836
from an Afghan point of view.

02:15.869 --> 02:18.206
But I can't think of any.

02:18.239 --> 02:20.874
Actually, I can't think at all.

02:20.908 --> 02:22.876
Is this about your office again?

02:22.910 --> 02:24.478
It doesn't promote
quality thought.

02:24.512 --> 02:25.913
A good thinking spot is key.

02:25.946 --> 02:27.581
I like the library.

02:27.615 --> 02:30.251
How can your mind breathe
with all those musty books

02:30.284 --> 02:31.652
suffocating you?
Ah.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.854
(chuckles)
Well, what would you suggest?

02:33.887 --> 02:35.756
A place with much oxygen.

02:35.789 --> 02:38.359
The forest.
TORRES:
Qasim.

02:38.392 --> 02:40.761
Hey, nice to see you, man.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.963
Oh, they let you out of
the annex building?

02:42.996 --> 02:44.598
I have to get back.

02:44.632 --> 02:46.900
Just wanted to walk Ellie
to her desk.

02:49.270 --> 02:50.404
Okay, well...

02:50.438 --> 02:52.373
I'll pick you up
here for dinner.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.608
Okay. Bye.

02:56.009 --> 02:58.846
Young love. Nothing like it.

02:58.879 --> 03:01.415
Hey, would you guys ever
go to the woods to think?

03:01.449 --> 03:03.817
No, I do my best thinking
when I'm sleeping.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.420
Mine is in the bathroom.

03:06.454 --> 03:08.956
Everything is simple
in the bathroom.

03:08.989 --> 03:11.659
McGee, what about you?

03:11.692 --> 03:12.760
McGee.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.695
Huh?

03:14.728 --> 03:15.696
What are you reading, man?

03:15.729 --> 03:17.798
Uh, nothing.

03:17.831 --> 03:19.467
Not convincing.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.901
Nothing?

03:22.035 --> 03:24.472
McGee. Willoughby.

03:24.505 --> 03:25.839
Read them in.

03:25.873 --> 03:28.709
Thank God.
Interrogation, let's talk.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.380
What's Willoughby?

03:32.413 --> 03:34.782
McGEE: Operation Willoughby
has been prepping for months.

03:34.815 --> 03:36.950
Our target is Kai Chen.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.352
This is the last photo
we have of him,

03:38.386 --> 03:39.620
it was taken
15 years ago.

03:39.653 --> 03:40.954
Wealthy businessman
suspected of

03:40.988 --> 03:41.989
committing acts of terror

03:42.022 --> 03:43.791
to manipulate the stock market.

03:43.824 --> 03:46.026
Rumor was that he sent
a suicide bomber

03:46.059 --> 03:49.029
into a Belgian bank.
Played the dip in the market.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.031
And the attempted attack
on the USS Mulligan?

03:51.064 --> 03:53.467
Chen funded that as well.

03:53.501 --> 03:54.935
He was, uh, hoping to cash in

03:54.968 --> 03:56.470
on the surge in oil prices.

03:56.504 --> 03:58.038
So the task force got together

03:58.071 --> 03:59.807
to take him down.
Slam dunk.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.775
Chen is beyond careful.

04:01.809 --> 04:03.577
We don't have any
concrete evidence

04:03.611 --> 04:04.878
connecting him to any of this.

04:04.912 --> 04:07.781
Okay, Operation Willoughby
is about collecting proof?

04:07.815 --> 04:09.917
Opportunity came last night.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.585
Reeves learned
that Chen was prepping to fly

04:11.619 --> 04:12.886
into the D.C. area.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.655
We helped
the regular copilot

04:14.688 --> 04:17.057
get food poisoning,
and Reeves stepped in.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.926
Officer Moreau, can you hear me?

04:18.959 --> 04:20.761
Yes, I'm here.

04:20.794 --> 04:22.463
Do we have the rest
of the task force?

04:22.496 --> 04:24.064
We have everyone except MI6.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.334
They'll get here when they can.
Sitrep.

04:26.367 --> 04:27.568
Reeves and Jintao
have entered the plane,

04:27.601 --> 04:28.936
along with the pilot.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.471
KRUGER:
Signal is confirming

04:30.504 --> 04:31.939
Reeves has placed
the device in the cockpit.

04:31.972 --> 04:33.040
We're remotely scanning
to ensure

04:33.073 --> 04:34.642
it's prepped for activation.

04:34.675 --> 04:36.944
How far out is Chen?

04:36.977 --> 04:39.347
Ten minutes away, sir.
McGEE:
Once the plane is airborne

04:39.380 --> 04:42.483
and Chen connects his laptop
to the plane's Wi-Fi,

04:42.516 --> 04:44.084
Reeves will activate

04:44.117 --> 04:46.787
an S14 proximity device.

04:46.820 --> 04:49.857
So this device remotely copies
data from Chen's computer

04:49.890 --> 04:51.792
and immediately sends it to us.

04:51.825 --> 04:54.528
We get the proof we need,
and we take him down.

04:54.562 --> 04:56.530
I don't understand,
what's the catch here?

04:56.564 --> 04:59.333
I mean, when NCIS came to FLETC
to get recruits,

04:59.367 --> 05:01.769
they said it was something
like a suicide mission.

05:01.802 --> 05:05.373
Chen's digital security
is-is beyond top-notch.

05:05.406 --> 05:07.608
Once we begin the download,

05:07.641 --> 05:09.009
Chen will be alerted.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.444
Reeves will be stuck
on a plane

05:10.478 --> 05:11.545
with a bunch of guys
who want to kill him.

05:13.481 --> 05:16.049
NCIS TECH:
Chen is four minutes out, Sir.
The device?

05:16.083 --> 05:17.551
Signal is functioning properly.

05:17.585 --> 05:18.786
We're ready for activation.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.421
We got movement.

05:22.490 --> 05:24.057
What is going on?
Is that Jintao?

05:25.125 --> 05:26.594
He's exiting the plane.

05:26.627 --> 05:28.562
I don't like this.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.098
What's the directive?

05:32.800 --> 05:34.334
This could be routine.
Stand by.

05:35.603 --> 05:37.405
NCIS TECH: Jintao's entering
his vehicle, sir.

05:40.107 --> 05:42.910
Chen's car is exiting
the highway.
Damn it, he knows.

05:42.943 --> 05:45.112
Call the tower, tell them to
give Reeves the abort code.
Yes, sir.

05:45.145 --> 05:47.047
Get him out of there.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.816
TECH:
Tower, dispatch code Lima...

05:48.849 --> 05:50.751
Get him out of there now!

06:11.905 --> 06:13.641
McGEE: Look, I will get
the Secretary of the Navy

06:13.674 --> 06:15.108
on the phone if I have to.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.110
No, I-I don't care
what your source says,

06:17.144 --> 06:19.880
it's a matter of
national security...

06:19.913 --> 06:22.015
Yes, you do that.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.817
Press?
Yeah.

06:23.851 --> 06:25.185
Got them all confirming
mechanical failure

06:25.218 --> 06:26.720
with no survivors.

06:26.754 --> 06:28.055
Last thing we need is Chen

06:28.088 --> 06:30.057
seeing some report
that Reeves is still alive.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.893
Have you heard from Reeves?
Yeah,

06:32.926 --> 06:33.961
he actually sounded pretty good.

06:33.994 --> 06:36.129
Gibbs is with him
at the hospital.

06:36.163 --> 06:38.198
Pilot's in surgery.
How about the scene?

06:38.231 --> 06:39.767
It was a mess.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.034
Torres and Quinn
are getting the debris

06:41.068 --> 06:41.935
to Abby and the NTSB.

06:41.969 --> 06:44.438
I interviewed every witness
I could find.

06:44.472 --> 06:45.906
Best I could get on Jintao

06:45.939 --> 06:47.875
was that he was last seen
heading south,

06:47.908 --> 06:49.710
away from the airport.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.079
All right, well, I got a BOLO
out on him and his black SUV.

06:52.112 --> 06:54.615
Do we still have eyes on Chen?
No.

06:54.648 --> 06:56.484
He drove underground,
switched cars

06:56.517 --> 06:57.951
and the satellite lost him.

06:57.985 --> 06:59.487
McGee, what was this?

06:59.520 --> 07:02.055
The explosion, I mean.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.791
Was someone trying
to take Chen down,

07:03.824 --> 07:05.058
or was Chen
trying to take us down?

07:05.092 --> 07:07.094
The timing was too perfect.

07:07.127 --> 07:09.930
I mean, somebody had to tip
Chen off about Willoughby.

07:09.963 --> 07:12.232
This was all him.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.535
What?

07:14.568 --> 07:16.003
REPORTER:
Sources are now confirming

07:16.036 --> 07:17.671
that the two men injured

07:17.705 --> 07:19.139
in this morning's
plane explosion,

07:19.172 --> 07:21.074
are, in fact, alive

07:21.108 --> 07:24.111
although one of them
remains in critical condition.

07:24.144 --> 07:26.146
You kidding me?
They ran the story anyway.

07:29.082 --> 07:30.484
GIBBS:
Chen knows that you're alive

07:30.518 --> 07:32.085
and you could be
a target, Reeves.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.987
You need to lay low.

07:34.021 --> 07:36.990
Yeah, I'd rather not.

07:37.024 --> 07:38.959
If you've got a shirt
I could borrow,

07:38.992 --> 07:41.562
that'd be lovely.

07:41.595 --> 07:43.697
The doc released you?

07:43.731 --> 07:44.965
I released me.

07:44.998 --> 07:46.700
Just a few bumps.

07:46.734 --> 07:48.569
I've been hurt worse
falling out of bed.

07:48.602 --> 07:51.038
What happened out there?

07:51.071 --> 07:52.540
I'm telling you,

07:52.573 --> 07:54.007
all the important bits
are in working order.

07:54.041 --> 07:56.009
I'm completely fine.

07:56.043 --> 07:58.211
What happened?

07:59.647 --> 08:01.782
I saw Jintao leaving.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.651
I knew something was wrong.

08:03.684 --> 08:04.985
I didn't know
what I'd be walking into,

08:05.018 --> 08:06.720
going down the stairs after him.

08:06.754 --> 08:08.088
So I jumped out the exit window

08:08.121 --> 08:08.922
on the other side of the plane.

08:08.956 --> 08:11.258
The pilot, Miller--
he followed me.

08:11.291 --> 08:13.927
You need to lay low.

08:13.961 --> 08:15.128
Gibbs.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.030
Before he left,
I heard Jintao on the phone.

08:17.064 --> 08:18.732
He was speaking Chinese.

08:18.766 --> 08:21.068
He said Chen's planning
another attack.

08:21.101 --> 08:24.071
We need to get this guy
before he does more damage.

08:24.104 --> 08:27.074
Put me back in. Come on,
all I need is a shirt.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.977
You're here
until the doctor releases you.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.311
And then what?

08:31.344 --> 08:33.080
Headquarters.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.015
Hiding. That's a joke.

08:35.048 --> 08:36.784
It's an order.

08:36.817 --> 08:39.286
Look, I volunteered
for Willoughby.

08:39.319 --> 08:41.154
I know what I signed up for.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.290
Let me see this
through to the end.

08:43.323 --> 08:45.759
We'll see this
through together, Reeves.

08:45.793 --> 08:47.895
(phone ringing)
All right?

08:49.162 --> 08:51.098
Yeah, Leon. I'm on the way.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.768
VANCE: Does Reeves
have anything specific?

08:54.802 --> 08:57.571
Chen has a new project.
That's all we know.

08:57.605 --> 09:00.173
All right. So, we start
with Willoughby.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.743
As far as we were concerned,
that op was as close

09:02.776 --> 09:04.244
to foolproof as it gets.

09:04.277 --> 09:05.979
Yeah. But it wasn't, was it?

09:07.080 --> 09:08.782
Who tipped off Chen?

09:08.816 --> 09:11.084
Task force is investigating.

09:11.118 --> 09:13.320
All participating agencies
have been dispatched.

09:13.353 --> 09:17.190
MI6 rep is already in
deep with several leads.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.627
He won't be able
to join us until Monday.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.194
You're calling a meeting?

09:21.228 --> 09:23.864
Circumstances haven't changed,
Gibbs.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.634
Our only play is to get
the proof we need

09:26.667 --> 09:28.068
so we can arrest Chen.

09:28.101 --> 09:31.104
Task force is on its way here
to design a new op.

09:31.138 --> 09:33.173
So you're calling a meeting.

09:33.206 --> 09:35.208
Is there a problem?

09:35.242 --> 09:37.344
With all due respect, Director,

09:37.377 --> 09:39.346
our last meeting
went on for months

09:39.379 --> 09:42.750
and ended up with us
almost losing Reeves.

09:42.783 --> 09:45.719
All right. Say it.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.788
We have leads to follow here,

09:47.821 --> 09:49.122
now, on the ground.

09:49.156 --> 09:51.191
Then do it.

09:51.224 --> 09:54.127
But remember, Chen's
an international threat.

09:54.161 --> 09:56.129
He's a ghost.

09:56.163 --> 09:57.831
We need the task force
with us, Gibbs.

09:57.865 --> 09:59.132
We can't do this alone.

10:11.311 --> 10:12.746
(knocking on door)

10:12.780 --> 10:13.981
Qasim.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.182
Hi.
Hey.

10:15.215 --> 10:17.317
You're in my office.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.419
(chuckles)
Yeah. Uh, the mail guy

10:19.452 --> 10:22.089
saw the "NSA" return address
and assumed it was for me.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.157
More calls to translate.

10:24.191 --> 10:27.160
(sighs)
Hey. I was gonna ask you...

10:27.194 --> 10:28.228
If I figured out

10:28.261 --> 10:29.930
any double meanings?

10:29.963 --> 10:31.164
Not even close.

10:31.198 --> 10:32.666
Uh...
In this one...

10:32.700 --> 10:34.434
Mm! They're telling stories

10:34.467 --> 10:36.336
about the trips
they've taken.

10:36.369 --> 10:38.872
Paris, Amsterdam, Cairo.

10:38.906 --> 10:41.875
Qasim.
I know. I need to get
out of this office.

10:41.909 --> 10:44.277
(chuckles)
Maybe my own trip to the forest

10:44.311 --> 10:45.946
would help me think.
We could go after dinner

10:45.979 --> 10:47.114
if you don't mind the cold.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.983
Actually, I was gonna ask you

10:50.017 --> 10:51.719
if we could reschedule.

10:51.752 --> 10:54.187
Oh.

10:54.221 --> 10:55.923
Uh, of course.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.190
Um, okay. Thanks.

10:57.224 --> 10:59.226
I just... I have
to work late, so,

10:59.259 --> 11:01.729
I... I should get back.
(chuckles)

11:01.762 --> 11:03.230
Ellie.

11:04.765 --> 11:06.266
Are you okay?

11:06.299 --> 11:07.735
Yeah.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.169
Yeah. It's nothing,
I just...

11:09.202 --> 11:11.038
(sighs)

11:11.071 --> 11:14.274
I happened to see Reeves'
personal info sheet.

11:14.307 --> 11:17.711
The agent from England? The one
that looks like a sculpture?

11:17.745 --> 11:19.312
(both chuckle)

11:19.346 --> 11:20.447
Yeah. Under "Emergency Contact,"

11:20.480 --> 11:23.216
he listed himself.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.085
Who does that?

11:25.118 --> 11:27.988
I wrote you.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.222
What?

11:29.256 --> 11:31.358
Under "Emergency Contact,"

11:31.391 --> 11:33.426
I wrote your name.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.428
You did?

11:35.462 --> 11:37.965
Maybe Reeves only wrote himself

11:37.998 --> 11:40.400
because he doesn't
have anyone else to write.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.905
I could... write
myself if you would...

11:44.938 --> 11:46.239
rather.
(chuckles)

11:46.273 --> 11:48.275
No. (laughs)
No, I...

11:48.308 --> 11:49.910
Don't... Don't change it.

11:49.943 --> 11:52.479
I... I like it.

11:52.512 --> 11:54.247
Okay. Give me an update.

11:54.281 --> 11:57.284
Pilot Paul Miller
is out of surgery,

11:57.317 --> 11:59.319
and McGee's on the way
to the hospital to question him.

11:59.352 --> 12:01.188
Mm. What else?
Let's talk bad guys.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.090
Chen went back in hiding.

12:03.123 --> 12:05.225
There's no recent picture of the
guy, so good luck finding him.

12:05.258 --> 12:07.828
Yeah. And as you know, Chen's
second-in-command is this guy,

12:07.861 --> 12:09.096
Edward Jintao.

12:09.129 --> 12:10.898
TORRES: Jintao drove away
from the airport

12:10.931 --> 12:12.465
and went off the grid.

12:12.499 --> 12:15.002
But even if we did know where
he was, we don't have enough

12:15.035 --> 12:17.204
to arrest him or Chen.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.772
I got something.

12:18.806 --> 12:21.174
Hey, you brought your own update

12:21.208 --> 12:23.276
to, uh, update time?
(chuckles)

12:23.310 --> 12:24.945
Well, that's refreshing.

12:24.978 --> 12:26.546
Jintao vetted Reeves.

12:26.579 --> 12:29.016
Afterwards, Reeves followed him.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.117
To where?

12:30.150 --> 12:31.451
Auto parts company in D.C.

12:32.920 --> 12:35.088
It could be Chen's local hub.

12:35.122 --> 12:36.857
You think Jintao
will go back there?

12:36.890 --> 12:38.225
I think the two of you
should find out.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.426
Copy that.

12:39.459 --> 12:42.129
I'll get my stakeout gear, baby.

12:42.162 --> 12:44.965
Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs.
What do you got, Abbs?

12:44.998 --> 12:47.567
Um, nothing on the plane debris.
I haven't been able

12:47.600 --> 12:50.270
to find anything
to confirm who set the bomb.

12:50.303 --> 12:53.306
I wouldn't put it past Chen
to rig the plane.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.308
Yeah. Self-destruct
in case of emergency,

12:55.342 --> 12:57.344
but like I said, no proof.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.579
So why'd you get
on the elevator?

12:59.612 --> 13:04.417
Because, the Belgian VSSE
intercepted a transmission.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.854
It was coded,
but they sent it to me, and...
And you decoded it.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.288
Yes.
What was it?

13:08.321 --> 13:10.023
It was a communication to Chen

13:10.057 --> 13:12.259
from the pilot, Paul Miller.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.327
It was at 8:12 a.m.,

13:14.361 --> 13:17.364
right before Chen turned his car
away from the airport.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.332
Pilot tipped him off.

13:19.366 --> 13:20.367
Yeah.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.903
But how did the pilot know

13:22.936 --> 13:24.537
that Willoughby was a setup?

13:27.240 --> 13:28.541
Yeah. Yeah, you got it, boss.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.477
I've officially been
released, all right?

13:30.510 --> 13:32.345
Go ahead, call him
back and tell him.

13:32.379 --> 13:33.613
What?

13:33.646 --> 13:35.215
Gibbs.

13:35.248 --> 13:37.350
He sent you here
to check on me, yeah?

13:37.384 --> 13:39.419
No. No, Reeves, listen.

13:39.452 --> 13:41.288
The pilot is the one
that tipped Chen off.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.123
Come on.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.193
(plastic bag crinkles)

13:52.299 --> 13:54.101
(door opens)

13:57.637 --> 14:00.473
McGEE:
Paul Miller?

14:00.507 --> 14:02.342
NCIS. We need to ask you

14:02.375 --> 14:04.477
a few questions about Kai Chen.

14:04.511 --> 14:07.314
(exhales)
NCIS?

14:07.347 --> 14:09.549
Listen, Paul, apologies
for the alter ego,

14:09.582 --> 14:12.085
but... I wasn't the only one

14:12.119 --> 14:14.854
keeping secrets, was I?

14:16.456 --> 14:18.491
A-Are you...

14:18.525 --> 14:20.961
Are you gonna talk to my girls?

14:22.462 --> 14:25.632
Mr. Miller, you told Chen
not to come to the airport.

14:25.665 --> 14:27.467
How did you know to warn him?

14:28.701 --> 14:31.438
My girls don't know anything.

14:31.471 --> 14:34.641
Come on, mate, we need you
to listen to what we're asking.

14:38.078 --> 14:39.046
McGEE:
He's flatlining.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.113
Paul.
Nurse!

14:40.147 --> 14:41.214
Paul!

14:41.248 --> 14:42.415
Nurse!
Paul!

14:52.625 --> 14:55.195
The Great Roxbury Fire

14:55.228 --> 14:58.565
occurred in May, 1894.

14:58.598 --> 15:01.334
The Boston Beaneaters

15:01.368 --> 15:04.071
were playing
the Baltimore Orioles

15:04.104 --> 15:07.674
in the South End Grounds
when a fan in the bleachers

15:07.707 --> 15:11.044
lit a cigar
and dropped the match.

15:11.078 --> 15:13.013
The wooden grandstand

15:13.046 --> 15:15.548
went up in flames and spread

15:15.582 --> 15:17.617
to 117 houses.

15:17.650 --> 15:21.354
But much like this
morning's catastrophe,

15:21.388 --> 15:23.690
the incredible count
of fatalities

15:23.723 --> 15:25.525
when all was said and done

15:25.558 --> 15:26.693
was zero.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.295
What about this guy?

15:28.328 --> 15:31.965
Well, our pilot
was severely injured

15:31.999 --> 15:33.300
while jumping from
the plane and dodging

15:33.333 --> 15:35.602
the debris from the explosion,

15:35.635 --> 15:38.405
but these wounds
did not kill him.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.739
Surgery complications?

15:39.772 --> 15:43.276
Good guess, but, uh, wrong,
nonetheless.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.545
I feel like
I'm on a game show here.

15:45.578 --> 15:47.247
(chuckles)
I'm sorry, Jethro.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.649
Even after all these years,
I get a kick

15:49.682 --> 15:52.986
out of hearing your conjectures.

15:54.521 --> 15:56.556
Yeah, well. Miller here, um,

15:56.589 --> 15:58.725
had every chance
of making a full recovery,

15:58.758 --> 16:01.528
but for the morphine.

16:01.561 --> 16:03.063
He was drugged?

16:03.096 --> 16:04.131
Yes. Abby's tox screen

16:04.164 --> 16:06.466
shows that he died
of an overdose.

16:06.499 --> 16:08.201
Had agents outside his room

16:08.235 --> 16:10.170
the whole time, Duck.
Nobody got in.

16:10.203 --> 16:12.405
I don't doubt it.
But my suspicions

16:12.439 --> 16:14.241
were confirmed when McGee

16:14.274 --> 16:16.209
pulled a set of fingerprints

16:16.243 --> 16:19.079
from the keypad lock
on the morphine drip.

16:20.713 --> 16:22.315
The prints were Miller's?

16:22.349 --> 16:26.353
Yes. He must've watched
an unsuspecting nurse

16:26.386 --> 16:29.756
enter the code.
And after she left the room,

16:29.789 --> 16:34.127
well, he increased his own
morphine to commit suicide.

16:34.161 --> 16:35.695
BISHOP:
People in Chen's organization

16:35.728 --> 16:39.199
are bound to loyalty.

16:39.232 --> 16:42.535
He has a history of hurting the
families of anyone who talks.

16:42.569 --> 16:44.137
More than hurting.

16:44.171 --> 16:45.672
Exactly.

16:45.705 --> 16:48.408
Which is why Paul Miller
was terrified

16:48.441 --> 16:49.809
to talk to us.

16:49.842 --> 16:50.810
He had a family?

16:50.843 --> 16:52.112
Mm-hmm.

16:52.145 --> 16:54.114
A wife

16:54.147 --> 16:56.349
and a nine-year-old daughter.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.351
He talked about them
before he died.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.253
Took his own life
to protect them.

17:00.287 --> 17:04.124
McGee, if Chen was able
to scare Miller that much,

17:04.157 --> 17:06.193
what did he know?

17:06.226 --> 17:08.695
Well, he's been with the
organization for five years,

17:08.728 --> 17:09.796
traveling with Chen.

17:09.829 --> 17:12.165
Got paid a ton of
money to be on call,

17:12.199 --> 17:13.600
like all of Chen's pilots.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.702
What about Reeves?

17:15.735 --> 17:17.137
Well, I still have
more on Miller...

17:17.170 --> 17:18.671
No, but did you know

17:18.705 --> 17:20.707
that Reeves spent months
getting his pilot license,

17:20.740 --> 17:23.643
and then gaining Miller's trust
to become his go-to backup?

17:23.676 --> 17:26.346
I mean, that's like,
a huge commitment for him.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.848
Yeah. Bishop, I read you in
on this, remember?

17:28.881 --> 17:31.084
Yeah. I'm just saying,

17:31.118 --> 17:32.852
I don't think Reeves
has many friends.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.387
McGEE:
What?

17:34.421 --> 17:35.588
REEVES:
Hey.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.358
Hey. You're back.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.861
Listen, I know
what the two of you

17:41.894 --> 17:43.730
were probably
discussing just now.

17:43.763 --> 17:46.833
Actually, I can't
even begin to tell you

17:46.866 --> 17:48.535
what we were discussing.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.603
Bishop was being
very confusing.

17:50.637 --> 17:52.305
I was?

17:52.339 --> 17:53.473
Sometimes,
when you overthink things,

17:53.506 --> 17:54.874
you get confusing.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.243
I do?
Mm-hmm.

17:56.276 --> 17:58.211
All right, then I'll be clear.

17:58.245 --> 18:00.113
I'm fine, I'm
on desk duty.

18:00.147 --> 18:02.715
And I'm ready to
move on and get Chen.

18:02.749 --> 18:06.419
Somebody checking out the place
Jintao went after he vetted me?

18:06.453 --> 18:08.555
The auto parts place?
Yeah. Quinn and Torres

18:08.588 --> 18:10.423
have been staking it
out since last night.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.359
Good.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.734
This isn't good.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.170
You're gonna have to be

18:23.203 --> 18:25.172
a little more specific.

18:25.205 --> 18:27.174
This isn't good.
We're too conspicuous.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.176
We're fine.
(sighs)

18:29.209 --> 18:31.278
We're not fine.
Yesterday, we were fine.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.613
There were other cars here.
Now we're the only
car on the block.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.248
We might as well
have our lights flashing.

18:35.282 --> 18:37.150
Calm down.

18:37.184 --> 18:38.851
Look, if anyone sees us,

18:38.885 --> 18:41.188
we start making out.

18:41.221 --> 18:43.190
That's a great idea.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.325
Really?
No.

18:45.358 --> 18:47.327
Oh.
There's a window,

18:47.360 --> 18:49.229
up there, and I think
that's a better place.

18:49.262 --> 18:50.530
It's a good lookout.

18:50.563 --> 18:52.265
Let's park the car,
let's get up there.

18:52.299 --> 18:55.702
Um. That's a cute plan,
except I don't take any orders.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.704
Would you rather
that I tell everyone

18:57.737 --> 19:00.240
about your hour-long
beauty regimen?

19:00.273 --> 19:02.342
I don't feel good about it.
Okay.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.277
Well, then, why don't
you hide the car?

19:04.311 --> 19:05.545
Yeah.

19:05.578 --> 19:07.214
(engine starts)

19:07.247 --> 19:08.615
LARRY:
So, these are our specialty.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.383
Six mini donuts to a pack.

19:10.417 --> 19:12.585
Hey. I can take you out
on the floor

19:12.619 --> 19:14.687
if you want to see how we
apply the powdered sugar.

19:14.721 --> 19:17.790
Oh. Appreciate the offer, but we
really need to find that window.

19:17.824 --> 19:20.427
Oh, sure, yeah. I-It's this way.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.462
You know, I can tell,
the two of you

19:22.495 --> 19:24.297
are living the dream,
being cops.

19:24.331 --> 19:26.699
Federal agents.

19:26.733 --> 19:29.602
Me, I'm looking to leave
desserts and move into entrees.

19:29.636 --> 19:31.904
I'm talking chicken pot pies.

19:31.938 --> 19:34.274
I've been working
on a recipe for years.

19:34.307 --> 19:35.475
I mean, a guy can dream, right?

19:35.508 --> 19:37.944
Sky's the limit, apparently.
(chuckles)

19:37.977 --> 19:40.480
And...

19:40.513 --> 19:42.349
here we go.

19:44.351 --> 19:45.418
That's the window?

19:54.361 --> 19:55.295
Nice.

19:55.328 --> 19:56.896
You can't be serious.

19:56.929 --> 19:58.331
Well, you know, everything's
a lot more simple

19:58.365 --> 20:00.667
in the bathroom.
Am I right?

20:00.700 --> 20:03.736
Larry, you mind putting an
Out of Order sign on the door?

20:03.770 --> 20:05.338
No. Not a problem.

20:05.372 --> 20:06.506
You kids have fun.

20:06.539 --> 20:07.940
Mm-hmm.

20:07.974 --> 20:10.310
Oh, yeah.

20:10.343 --> 20:12.845
There must have been a
window that we didn't see.

20:12.879 --> 20:15.515
I mean, it's either this or, um,

20:15.548 --> 20:17.584
making out in the car.

20:21.654 --> 20:23.656
VANCE: I want to thank each
of you for making the trip.

20:23.690 --> 20:25.458
It wasn't a choice.

20:25.492 --> 20:27.360
Stopping Chen is an imperative.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.529
Then we'll skip
the pleasantries.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.931
G.I.D. has intercepted chatter
that supports your theory

20:31.964 --> 20:33.666
that Chen is planning
a new attack.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.001
Do you have a target?

20:35.034 --> 20:36.803
The financial district
in New York

20:36.836 --> 20:38.971
was hypothesized
but not confirmed.

20:39.005 --> 20:40.473
Well, until we have
something certain, then,

20:40.507 --> 20:41.808
it's all just smoke.

20:41.841 --> 20:44.344
What about our MI6 operative?

20:44.377 --> 20:46.846
Clayton Reeves.

20:46.879 --> 20:49.549
Director Vance.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.051
Is it possible Reeves
told the pilot about Willoughby?

20:52.084 --> 20:54.887
No. Reeves is clean.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.789
Perhaps he was worried
for Miller's safety.

20:56.823 --> 20:59.058
They became close
over those months, did they not?

20:59.091 --> 21:01.594
KRUGER:
Reeves was sent in

21:01.628 --> 21:03.563
to befriend Miller because
of their similar upbringing,

21:03.596 --> 21:06.533
the parallel challenges
they both faced.

21:06.566 --> 21:08.601
This is the very reason
they bonded so quickly.

21:08.635 --> 21:09.969
We must consider
the possibility...

21:10.002 --> 21:12.605
Officers, I debriefed
Reeves myself.

21:12.639 --> 21:15.408
I assure you,
he wasn't compromised.

21:15.442 --> 21:18.445
Then we must assume he somehow
tipped off Miller by accident.

21:18.478 --> 21:21.548
Agreed, but are we here
to pinpoint

21:21.581 --> 21:24.417
our failings
or to take down Chen?

21:24.451 --> 21:25.084
BISHOP:
Gibbs, listen.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.586
Bishop, I have been listening

21:26.619 --> 21:28.054
for the last ten minutes.
(sighs)

21:28.087 --> 21:29.822
I still don't know
what you're saying.

21:29.856 --> 21:31.658
I'm saying that
when I met up with Reeves

21:31.691 --> 21:32.925
in Scotland last summer,

21:32.959 --> 21:35.795
we had some really
great talks.

21:35.828 --> 21:37.730
I mean, I think I'm one
of his only friends,

21:37.764 --> 21:40.633
and he never even told me
that he was gonna risk his life,

21:40.667 --> 21:42.369
and I just...
You're worried about him.

21:42.402 --> 21:43.503
Yes.

21:43.536 --> 21:44.837
Why didn't you just say that

21:44.871 --> 21:46.105
ten minutes ago?

21:46.138 --> 21:49.409
I thought I did.

21:49.442 --> 21:52.445
BISHOP: Alice, what can you
tell us about Paul's job?

21:53.613 --> 21:56.583
He didn't talk about it much...

21:56.616 --> 21:58.351
or maybe I didn't ask.

21:58.385 --> 22:00.587
I think part of me
knew the money

22:00.620 --> 22:02.422
was too good to be true.

22:02.455 --> 22:04.857
What about the man
he worked for?

22:04.891 --> 22:07.494
I don't even know his name.

22:08.961 --> 22:10.897
Agent Gibbs...

22:13.466 --> 22:16.603
...Paul didn't have it
easy growing up.

22:16.636 --> 22:19.739
All he wanted was to give
Lexie something better.

22:19.772 --> 22:21.608
This has been
so hard on her.

22:21.641 --> 22:25.412
She's refused to leave
my side since it happened.

22:28.448 --> 22:30.583
Whatever he was involved in...

22:30.617 --> 22:33.486
he was a good man.

22:33.520 --> 22:36.389
I don't want her to know
anything else.

22:37.657 --> 22:39.426
I like your bracelet.

22:39.459 --> 22:41.861
ALICE: Whenever Paul
flew somewhere,

22:41.894 --> 22:43.796
he'd bring a charm back for her.

22:43.830 --> 22:45.064
Right, baby?

22:45.097 --> 22:46.766
Mm.

22:46.799 --> 22:48.134
This is so cool.

22:48.167 --> 22:51.704
Eiffel Tower...
oh, a little shoe.

22:51.738 --> 22:54.407
It's a clog from Amsterdam.

22:54.441 --> 22:56.509
This is a pyramid.

22:56.543 --> 22:59.712
Where's it from again, Mom?

22:59.746 --> 23:01.380
Cairo.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.484
Ellie.

23:04.517 --> 23:06.553
The cities you were telling
me about this morning.

23:06.586 --> 23:07.987
What were they?
What?

23:08.020 --> 23:08.955
BISHOP:
From your translations,

23:08.988 --> 23:11.123
what were the cities
they were talking about?

23:11.157 --> 23:13.125
Oh, yes, I remember.

23:13.159 --> 23:14.861
Here it is.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.195
Paris, Amsterdam, Cairo.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.764
Same cities Chen went to.

23:18.765 --> 23:19.732
What's going on?

23:19.766 --> 23:20.733
We need copies

23:20.767 --> 23:21.801
of everything you got.

23:21.834 --> 23:23.169
BISHOP:
Qasim, these conversations

23:23.202 --> 23:24.504
you've been listening to,

23:24.537 --> 23:25.705
they're about a terrorist

23:25.738 --> 23:27.206
we've been tracking
for months.

23:27.239 --> 23:30.409
Your work could be the key
to stopping him.

23:38.217 --> 23:40.119
Our task force has been briefed
on Qasim's translations.

23:40.152 --> 23:41.521
Where is he?

23:41.554 --> 23:43.623
His office.
He's reviewing his work

23:43.656 --> 23:44.924
to see if anything
else connects

23:44.957 --> 23:45.925
now that he knows about Chen.

23:45.958 --> 23:48.561
NSA and MI6 are
doing the same.

23:48.595 --> 23:51.230
Here are the translations.

23:51.263 --> 23:54.166
I had hard copies made,
just in case anyone hates

23:54.200 --> 23:55.802
scrolling on the computer.

23:55.835 --> 23:57.604
These are all phone calls?

23:57.637 --> 24:00.773
Between the same two callers,
both unidentified.

24:00.807 --> 24:03.242
Do we know why two Afghans
are talking about Chen?

24:03.275 --> 24:04.811
They're not Afghan.

24:04.844 --> 24:06.178
Qasim said the callers
have accents.

24:06.212 --> 24:07.880
Foreigners speaking in Pashto.

24:07.914 --> 24:09.649
BISHOP: And not
just standard Pashto.

24:09.682 --> 24:12.151
It's a rare dialect. I couldn't
even understand it if I tried.

24:12.184 --> 24:14.754
We believe they're using
this language as a cloak.

24:14.787 --> 24:17.256
Like the Navajo Code Talkers
did in World War II.

24:17.289 --> 24:18.791
REEVES: Right, but these
guys are taking security

24:18.825 --> 24:20.192
to a whole nother level.

24:20.226 --> 24:23.095
Mundane topics that have another
meaning related to Chen.

24:23.129 --> 24:24.631
Code within a code.

24:24.664 --> 24:27.567
NSA has a new recording
from last night.

24:27.600 --> 24:28.901
Same two callers.

24:28.935 --> 24:30.837
Get it to Qasim.

24:30.870 --> 24:31.938
Torres.
Hey, you got anything?

24:33.305 --> 24:34.974
Yeah, I know.

24:35.007 --> 24:37.109
You know what?

24:37.143 --> 24:38.110
I'm the only one
who's had contact

24:38.144 --> 24:39.145
with Chen's organization,

24:39.178 --> 24:40.980
so you want me
to spend all night

24:41.013 --> 24:44.517
reading through this stack of
drivel to see if anything flags.

24:44.551 --> 24:47.186
Do you like steak?

24:47.219 --> 24:48.721
Do you marinate?

24:49.856 --> 24:52.592
Purist.
I can respect that.

24:52.625 --> 24:54.694
McGee?

24:54.727 --> 24:57.296
No activity in the auto parts
place, boss, but, uh,

24:57.329 --> 24:59.532
Torres says they're holding up
pretty great, so...

24:59.566 --> 25:01.934
TORRES: You know,
when man invented fire,

25:01.968 --> 25:03.570
it must've been
off the chain.

25:03.603 --> 25:05.104
Like, this guy comes in,

25:05.137 --> 25:07.006
he's rubbing two sticks
and, boom,

25:07.039 --> 25:08.575
changes the course of history
completely.

25:08.608 --> 25:10.042
"We got fire!"

25:10.076 --> 25:14.046
I feel like men and sticks
are meant for so much more,

25:14.080 --> 25:15.982
and we don't even know it.

25:17.249 --> 25:19.619
Man, I just thought of that.

25:20.953 --> 25:22.555
I dig bathrooms.

25:22.589 --> 25:23.956
Is that fan closed?

25:23.990 --> 25:25.324
TORRES:
No, it's broken,

25:25.357 --> 25:26.926
which makes this place

25:26.959 --> 25:28.961
kind of like a...
like a sweat lodge.

25:28.995 --> 25:30.963
It increases brain
activity even more.

25:30.997 --> 25:33.566
All right, great.
I got to get some food.

25:33.600 --> 25:37.937
Mm, could you get me
five more packages?

25:37.970 --> 25:41.073
Oh, that's unbelievable.
It smells like

25:41.107 --> 25:43.009
sweaty sugar in here.
You want more donuts?

25:43.042 --> 25:44.343
If I don't get a burger,

25:44.376 --> 25:45.812
I'm gonna die.

25:45.845 --> 25:47.647
Hey, the moment you leave
this building,

25:47.680 --> 25:48.981
Jintao's gonna show.

25:49.015 --> 25:52.785
Fine. What's this dude's name?
Larry?

25:52.819 --> 25:54.186
I'll get him
to make me one of his

25:54.220 --> 25:55.321
chicken potpies.

25:58.057 --> 25:59.892
TORRES:
Wait.

25:59.926 --> 26:00.927
There's a truck pulling up.

26:06.398 --> 26:07.634
(knock on door)

26:07.667 --> 26:08.901
Hey, guys, it's Larry.

26:08.935 --> 26:10.737
I need to use
the facilities.
Not now.

26:10.770 --> 26:12.639
LARRY: Uh, the other
bathroom's occupied,

26:12.672 --> 26:14.206
and this is an emergency.

26:16.943 --> 26:17.977
No, false alarm.

26:18.010 --> 26:20.346
All right. I'm out.
(grunts)

26:20.379 --> 26:23.716
I'm sorry, guys,
but those experimental potpies

26:23.750 --> 26:25.017
are going right through me.

26:26.385 --> 26:29.055
I'm getting donuts.

26:30.657 --> 26:31.824
Hey, you drop those pants,

26:31.858 --> 26:33.392
I'm gonna shoot you.

26:33.425 --> 26:36.696
(chuckles)
It's okay. I can wait.

26:36.729 --> 26:37.797
(chuckles)

26:40.900 --> 26:43.202
I'm not finding anything.

26:45.004 --> 26:47.006
Then what good are you?

26:47.039 --> 26:49.208
Thanks for
the non-marinated steak.

26:50.276 --> 26:52.178
(chuckles)

26:52.211 --> 26:54.981
So, are we gonna
get this over with?

26:55.014 --> 26:56.716
What's that?

26:56.749 --> 26:59.686
The talk you brought me
here to have.

26:59.719 --> 27:01.754
I don't like talking.

27:05.825 --> 27:07.727
But you like listening.

27:11.063 --> 27:12.932
I don't feel guilty
about tipping off Miller,

27:12.965 --> 27:14.200
if that's what
you're thinking,

27:14.233 --> 27:16.869
because I didn't do it.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.973
I went over every
single word I said.

27:21.007 --> 27:23.676
I didn't screw this up, Gibbs.

27:23.710 --> 27:25.978
Okay.

27:26.012 --> 27:28.280
"Okay"?

27:28.314 --> 27:30.850
That's rich.

27:30.883 --> 27:33.185
What else is there
for you to fix?

27:35.254 --> 27:37.757
My parents died
when I was three.

27:37.790 --> 27:41.227
I got passed around foster care,
drugs...

27:41.260 --> 27:43.395
Yeah, I read all that
in the file, Reeves.

27:45.732 --> 27:47.133
I don't need you
to worry about me.

27:47.166 --> 27:48.400
I don't...

27:48.434 --> 27:50.903
but Bishop does.

27:53.172 --> 27:54.941
Scotland.

28:02.782 --> 28:05.885
I went there alone
to figure some things out...

28:05.918 --> 28:08.320
life things.

28:08.354 --> 28:12.091
She was there the same time,
so we met up.

28:12.124 --> 28:14.994
She spoke about her family.

28:15.027 --> 28:16.495
Three brothers.

28:16.528 --> 28:17.930
Yeah.

28:19.799 --> 28:21.934
She also said you guys
were a family.

28:21.968 --> 28:25.838
Look on her face
when she said it...

28:29.809 --> 28:31.778
I came back...

28:31.811 --> 28:34.113
and I signed up for Willoughby.

28:36.048 --> 28:39.385
Because you guys shouldn't have
to do that type of mission.

28:43.189 --> 28:46.425
The kind of people...

28:46.458 --> 28:49.061
who have people.

28:53.499 --> 28:56.302
You think you're alone
in the dark.

28:59.138 --> 29:00.907
Close your eyes.

29:02.875 --> 29:05.244
Remember everything good.

29:08.480 --> 29:12.384
My mom said that to me
just before she died.

29:12.418 --> 29:14.386
Smart lady.

29:19.091 --> 29:21.293
Listen.
What?

29:21.327 --> 29:24.030
Six, nine, seven, nine, three.

29:24.063 --> 29:26.933
They're talking
about unlucky numbers.

29:26.966 --> 29:31.237
"69793 is not to be trusted."

29:31.270 --> 29:32.538
Gibbs...

29:32.571 --> 29:34.306
that's the end of the number

29:34.340 --> 29:35.942
of my pilot certificate.

29:35.975 --> 29:37.509
They're talking about me.

29:37.543 --> 29:39.145
When was that call made?

29:39.178 --> 29:40.546
Weeks ago.

29:42.514 --> 29:45.584
If they knew they couldn't
trust me back then...

29:45.617 --> 29:48.154
how long has Chen known
about Willoughby?

29:51.090 --> 29:54.861
(techo beat plays)

29:54.894 --> 29:57.864
Geez, what'd that bubble wrap
ever do to you?
ABBY:
Nothing.

29:57.897 --> 29:59.899
Actually, we have
a perfectly fine relationship.

29:59.932 --> 30:03.102
In the past, I've used
it as a warning signal

30:03.135 --> 30:05.104
for when Gibbs is coming,
but now it's helping me

30:05.137 --> 30:08.107
physicalize my aggression
in a nonviolent way.

30:08.140 --> 30:09.508
Why are you so angry?

30:09.541 --> 30:12.845
Because I don't like
being fooled, McGee,

30:12.879 --> 30:16.883
and we all got duped
by a super evil duper.

30:16.916 --> 30:18.117
Okay, Abby, why don't you

30:18.150 --> 30:19.551
come over here with me
and talk about it.

30:20.619 --> 30:22.588
I was looking
at the phone calls

30:22.621 --> 30:24.423
that Qasim translated.

30:24.456 --> 30:25.557
Right,
two unidentified callers,

30:25.591 --> 30:28.127
two untraceable
burn phones.
Yeah.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.897
And I remembered
what Qasim said

30:30.930 --> 30:34.300
about the callers having
accents, and then it hit me.

30:34.333 --> 30:37.469
I noticed a pattern
in the timing of the calls.

30:39.505 --> 30:42.541
Each one of these calls
was made less than an hour

30:42.574 --> 30:44.610
after a Willoughby
task force meeting.

30:44.643 --> 30:47.013
Wait, are you talking
about our task force?

30:47.046 --> 30:49.181
The one that's supposed
to bring down Chen?
Yeah.

30:49.215 --> 30:50.416
You saying we have a mole?

30:50.449 --> 30:52.084
That's exactly what I'm saying,

30:52.118 --> 30:53.886
and Qasim was right.

30:53.920 --> 30:56.188
The callers were speaking Pashto

30:56.222 --> 30:58.390
with a foreign accent.

30:58.424 --> 31:00.092
You were able to use
voice recognition.

31:00.126 --> 31:02.061
Yeah, on one of them...

31:02.094 --> 31:03.662
and I caught us

31:03.695 --> 31:06.999
a super evil duper.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.970
(knock on door)

31:15.241 --> 31:17.043
What is so urgent?

31:17.076 --> 31:18.277
Where are the others?

31:18.310 --> 31:20.646
Officer Moreau.

31:20.679 --> 31:23.983
There is no meeting.

31:24.016 --> 31:26.285
I don't understand.

31:26.318 --> 31:28.921
We got a mole.

31:28.955 --> 31:31.557
You mean, someone other than
Reeves tipped off the pilot?

31:31.590 --> 31:33.960
Miller was never tipped off.

31:35.427 --> 31:37.296
And the fake transmission
between Chen and him

31:37.329 --> 31:40.066
came to us from the VSSE.

31:40.099 --> 31:41.934
From you.

31:41.968 --> 31:45.404
Chen knew about Operation
Willoughby months ago.

31:45.437 --> 31:48.540
A-Are you suggesting
that I told him?

31:48.574 --> 31:51.343
Not suggesting. Proving.

31:52.544 --> 31:54.713
MOREAU:
Yes, I'm here.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.715
Do we have the rest
of the task force?

31:56.748 --> 31:58.985
We record everything in MTAC.

31:59.018 --> 32:02.021
We got one hell of
a forensic scientist.

32:02.054 --> 32:04.023
And she compared your voice
to Caller X

32:04.056 --> 32:06.092
in the Pashto conversations.

32:06.125 --> 32:09.728
MOREAU: Yes, I'm here. Do we
have the rest of the task force?

32:09.761 --> 32:11.530
(speaking in Pashto)

32:17.136 --> 32:19.972
I'd like to make a call.

32:20.006 --> 32:23.475
(chuckles softly)
I bet you would.

32:25.477 --> 32:27.013
Qasim?

32:27.046 --> 32:28.981
Ellie.

32:29.015 --> 32:30.382
(chuckles)
What are you doing here?

32:30.416 --> 32:32.051
Well, you weren't
in your office,

32:32.084 --> 32:33.719
and your ringer was off,

32:33.752 --> 32:35.621
so I had Abby ping your phone.

32:35.654 --> 32:36.688
I got pinged?

32:36.722 --> 32:37.689
Mm-hmm.
(laughs)

32:37.723 --> 32:40.259
That is so awesome.

32:40.292 --> 32:43.295
Recordings from last night.

32:43.329 --> 32:45.497
We need to get back
so you can translate them.

32:45.531 --> 32:48.034
Of course.

32:48.067 --> 32:49.335
Hey.

32:49.368 --> 32:51.770
You know
you're doing great, right?

32:51.803 --> 32:53.339
Really?

32:53.372 --> 32:55.341
Yeah. Your tip about the accents

32:55.374 --> 32:57.376
helped us make a lot of headway.

32:57.409 --> 32:59.645
That's good to know.

32:59.678 --> 33:01.513
I've been sitting here
for over an hour,

33:01.547 --> 33:04.016
thinking about codes
within codes, and still,

33:04.050 --> 33:06.052
I have nothing.

33:06.085 --> 33:09.655
But... you tried the library.

33:09.688 --> 33:11.323
I love the library.

33:11.357 --> 33:14.026
Well, I just had
about ten plants

33:14.060 --> 33:16.128
delivered to your office.
(both laugh)

33:18.564 --> 33:20.032
My own little thinking forest.

33:20.066 --> 33:22.034
Yep.

33:25.071 --> 33:26.505
Thank you.

33:28.107 --> 33:29.508
(automatic gunfire)

33:31.443 --> 33:33.745
(tires squeal outside)

33:33.779 --> 33:35.381
Somebody call 911!

33:35.414 --> 33:37.116
(panting):
Qasim.

33:37.149 --> 33:38.584
Hey. I'm here.

33:47.826 --> 33:51.330
Three gunshot wounds to the
chest. B.P. 70/40 and dropping.

33:51.363 --> 33:52.431
DOCTOR:
What's his name?

33:52.464 --> 33:53.799
Uh, Qasim.

33:53.832 --> 33:55.334
Qasim, can you hear me?

33:55.367 --> 33:58.204
Squeeze my hand
if you can hear me, Qasim.

33:58.237 --> 34:00.106
Unresponsive. Prep O.R. Four.

34:00.139 --> 34:02.374
Doctor, I...
You need to wait here.

34:04.410 --> 34:06.178
(exhales)

34:06.212 --> 34:09.215
What? All right. All right.
You keep me posted.

34:10.882 --> 34:13.319
Hey. Qasim's in surgery.

34:13.352 --> 34:15.121
Is someone there with Bishop?
Ducky's on the way.

34:15.154 --> 34:16.522
You find something?

34:16.555 --> 34:18.357
Yeah. A witness at the library
saw a black SUV

34:18.390 --> 34:20.326
parked outside at the time
of the shooting.

34:20.359 --> 34:21.360
Jintao.

34:21.393 --> 34:22.694
It's enough to question him,

34:22.728 --> 34:24.696
but not enough
to arrest him or Chen.

34:24.730 --> 34:27.466
McGee, find us something.

34:34.173 --> 34:35.441
Talk.

34:35.474 --> 34:38.410
I can't.

34:38.444 --> 34:40.212
Well, that about sums up
the last ten minutes

34:40.246 --> 34:41.413
in here, doesn't it?

34:41.447 --> 34:44.316
You don't understand.

34:44.350 --> 34:45.784
Chen has me.

34:45.817 --> 34:47.253
No.

34:47.286 --> 34:48.887
I have you.

34:48.920 --> 34:51.257
(sighs)

34:51.290 --> 34:55.327
I started to feed
him intel years ago.

34:55.361 --> 34:58.130
Before he became
the monster he is now.

34:58.164 --> 34:59.465
What about Willoughby?

34:59.498 --> 35:02.134
I-I needed the money.
My son...

35:02.168 --> 35:03.469
REEVES:
I'm not asking you

35:03.502 --> 35:06.772
why you got
into bed with a terrorist.

35:06.805 --> 35:09.341
I want to know why Chen
let Willoughby play out

35:09.375 --> 35:11.577
to the point
of blowing up his own plane.

35:14.213 --> 35:17.616
Willoughby kept the task force
tied up for months.

35:17.649 --> 35:22.154
And that was a positive
as far as Chen was concerned.

35:22.188 --> 35:25.524
And he knew that his pilot
had come to trust you.

35:25.557 --> 35:27.659
He thought Miller
might've turned.

35:27.693 --> 35:29.461
REEVES:
That explosion

35:29.495 --> 35:32.464
was meant to take us
both out. Is that right?

35:33.665 --> 35:35.667
GIBBS:
Qasim Naasir.

35:35.701 --> 35:39.205
We briefed you
on his translations. You knew...

35:41.240 --> 35:43.409
...that he was helping us.

35:43.442 --> 35:47.546
Chen didn't want last night's
conversation translated.

35:47.579 --> 35:49.881
He needed to buy time.

35:49.915 --> 35:53.219
But Chen did not shoot your man.

35:53.252 --> 35:56.555
No. But he ordered the hit.

35:56.588 --> 35:58.757
Jintao pulled the trigger, yes?

35:58.790 --> 36:01.593
If I say anything more,
my family is dead.

36:01.627 --> 36:03.829
Who were you speaking
to in Pashto?

36:03.862 --> 36:05.764
How much does Chen know?

36:05.797 --> 36:07.499
(sighs)

36:07.533 --> 36:09.435
Did you feed him everything?

36:10.469 --> 36:12.571
I want to speak to my embassy.

36:12.604 --> 36:14.206
What's his next target?

36:14.240 --> 36:15.507
I don't know.

36:15.541 --> 36:16.508
What's his target?

36:16.542 --> 36:17.876
All I know

36:17.909 --> 36:19.878
is from the task force,
same as you.

36:19.911 --> 36:22.681
New York's financial district.

36:22.714 --> 36:25.617
You're gonna call your embassy,
and you're gonna listen

36:25.651 --> 36:29.421
to them...
tell you that you're mine.

36:29.455 --> 36:30.789
And then you're
gonna get a message

36:30.822 --> 36:32.791
to Jintao...

36:32.824 --> 36:35.761
and you're gonna tell him
you need to have a meeting

36:35.794 --> 36:37.696
in that auto parts place.

36:37.729 --> 36:38.797
Agent Gibbs...

36:38.830 --> 36:41.267
(sighs)

36:42.334 --> 36:43.702
(door closes)

36:43.735 --> 36:45.837
I don't think
there was a choice anywhere

36:45.871 --> 36:47.539
in that little speech.

36:47.573 --> 36:49.608
Abbs.

36:49.641 --> 36:51.510
Don't try and stop me, Gibbs.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.612
Qasim is hurt,
and we know that

36:53.645 --> 36:55.614
Jintao shot him,
and we can't prove it,

36:55.647 --> 36:57.549
and I'm really, really angry.

36:57.583 --> 36:58.884
McGee.

36:58.917 --> 37:00.719
Boss, I'd just let
her do her thing.

37:00.752 --> 37:03.255
No. I'm asking
about Quinn and Torres.

37:03.289 --> 37:04.823
Ah. Uh, hang on.

37:04.856 --> 37:07.025
(Abby stomping)
All right, you're
on with Gibbs.

37:07.058 --> 37:08.527
Gibbs, Jintao is here.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.429
TORRES:
Yeah, he's just arrived.
His SUV

37:10.462 --> 37:11.363
is parked right
outside the building.

37:11.397 --> 37:12.898
QUINN: He went inside
waiting on Moreau.

37:12.931 --> 37:14.600
TORRES:
Hell of a trap, Gibbs.

37:14.633 --> 37:15.967
You just give us the go,
and we're in.

37:16.001 --> 37:18.337
You say the word, we'll
haul his ass in here.

37:18.370 --> 37:19.638
We'll get back to you.

37:21.940 --> 37:24.710
Did they get anything
on Jintao or not?
ABBY: Okay, Gibbs,

37:24.743 --> 37:28.280
I've worked off a lot of anger,
and I'm ready to push forward.

37:28.314 --> 37:29.648
Good to have you back, Abbs.
Go.

37:29.681 --> 37:31.683
Okay, so, when Jintao
went in the building,

37:31.717 --> 37:33.685
Torres and Quinn
were able to get

37:33.719 --> 37:35.287
the VIN number
off of his SUV,

37:35.321 --> 37:37.956
and that enabled us
to run a program

37:37.989 --> 37:40.826
that could remotely track
the vehicle's GPS history.

37:40.859 --> 37:42.528
We're waiting for it
to download.

37:42.561 --> 37:44.663
ABBY: McGee, I just...
want to tell you

37:44.696 --> 37:46.932
how much it means to me
how supportive you've been

37:46.965 --> 37:49.935
with my anger, and I feel
like it's made us even closer

37:49.968 --> 37:52.904
and put us on the same
wavelength, and...

37:52.938 --> 37:54.573
(computer dings)

37:54.606 --> 37:56.542
That's us.
That's us.

37:56.575 --> 37:58.377
All right, here we go, Abbs.
You can do it. Go!

37:58.410 --> 38:00.379
So supportive.

38:00.412 --> 38:03.014
Time of the shooting
was 8:34 p.m., and...

38:06.752 --> 38:10.622
And Jintao's car was at
830 Sawyer Avenue Southeast.

38:10.656 --> 38:11.623
That's the library.

38:11.657 --> 38:12.858
We got him.
We got him.

38:12.891 --> 38:14.326
Torres.

38:14.360 --> 38:15.661
TORRES: Yeah?
Bring him in.

38:17.863 --> 38:19.565
TORRES:
Jintao! Freeze!

38:20.866 --> 38:22.801
NCIS!

38:34.913 --> 38:36.047
Drop it.

38:36.081 --> 38:37.749
TORRES:
Come on, Jintao,

38:37.783 --> 38:39.050
talk to us.

38:39.084 --> 38:41.720
What does Chen have planned
for New York?

38:41.753 --> 38:43.422
(grunting weakly)

38:43.455 --> 38:46.124
Again and again...

38:46.157 --> 38:48.660
you underestimate him.

38:51.430 --> 38:51.763
No!

38:51.797 --> 38:53.098
(gunshot)

38:59.104 --> 39:01.807
(elevator dings,
footsteps approaching)

39:01.840 --> 39:03.475
Duck.

39:04.610 --> 39:06.745
(sighs) Are
the others coming?

39:06.778 --> 39:07.979
They're on their way.

39:08.013 --> 39:10.649
I'm afraid the news is not good.

39:10.682 --> 39:13.118
The doctors managed
to stop the bleeding,

39:13.151 --> 39:16.555
but Qasim was...
without oxygen for too long.

39:17.689 --> 39:19.658
What do you mean?

39:19.691 --> 39:22.794
There's no brain function.

39:22.828 --> 39:26.665
The machines are
keeping him alive now.

39:26.698 --> 39:29.701
Oh, Eleanor
was asking for you.

39:56.762 --> 39:58.697
(tapping on door)

40:16.848 --> 40:20.452
The last recording Qasim
was supposed to translate.

40:22.087 --> 40:24.523
Why are you giving this to me?

40:24.556 --> 40:27.192
I don't know your reason...

40:27.225 --> 40:31.062
but I know you're willing
to do anything to get Chen.

40:31.096 --> 40:33.098
So am I.

40:39.771 --> 40:41.940
(sighs)

40:46.077 --> 40:47.813
Ellie...

40:47.846 --> 40:50.816
do you want me
to stay with you?

40:50.849 --> 40:52.784
Uh... no.

40:54.252 --> 40:57.789
I just don't know
how to say good-bye to him.

41:00.992 --> 41:03.495
Maybe you could...

41:03.529 --> 41:05.931
close your eyes...

41:05.964 --> 41:08.934
and remember everything good.

41:13.905 --> 41:15.907
