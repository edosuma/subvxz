Prison Break:

00:03.337 --> 00:06.548
We're through the hard part.
Another 18 inches, we'll hit that pipe.

00:06.632 --> 00:07.799
We'll be there by Friday.

00:12.513 --> 00:15.766
Now, we got a hell of a lot to talk about,
don't we?

00:17.726 --> 00:19.436
BELLICK: This con says
he's on the job in here.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.271
Concrete is my specialty.

00:22.940 --> 00:24.691
Okay, boss. Sign him up.

<i>T-BAG: Whites don't want you,
blacks don't want you.</i>

00:28.278 --> 00:31.573
You're just caught in the middle,
aren't you? A regular tweener.

00:31.949 --> 00:33.534
- Hello.
- It's me.

00:33.617 --> 00:35.077
<i>- It's time.
Mes.</i>

00:35.619 --> 00:36.954
Why are you so cynical?

00:37.037 --> 00:39.456
Michael, I think there's cynicism
and then there's realism.

00:39.540 --> 00:42.292
And there's optimism. Hope. Faith.

00:42.376 --> 00:45.420
Thank you for trying to make me smile.
Not today.

00:45.504 --> 00:47.089
You never know.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.717
You want the Cooper story?

00:50.801 --> 00:53.470
I can't give it to you, 'cause I'm not him.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.431
The lawyers you tried to blow up,
they're still running around.

00:56.515 --> 00:57.766
Same thing goes with the kid.

00:57.849 --> 01:00.185
You got to hand the reins over to me now.

01:00.269 --> 01:01.645
First of all...

01:01.728 --> 01:04.690
You and your partner are off the job
until further notice.

01:17.828 --> 01:19.371

- SALESMAN: Nice choice.

01:51.903 --> 01:53.113
Thanks.

01:53.238 --> 01:55.324
Platinum. Brushed.

01:56.033 --> 01:58.702

-6.25.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.496
She's a lucky woman.

02:02.205 --> 02:03.332
Yes.

02:04.333 --> 02:05.542
She is.

02:11.173 --> 02:12.549
You kept it.

02:12.716 --> 02:14.051
Kept what?

02:14.426 --> 02:15.844
The flower.

02:16.303 --> 02:19.222
No. I'm a pack rat.
I never throw anything out.

02:19.306 --> 02:22.809
Yeah, all this clutter. It's overwhelming.

02:23.268 --> 02:25.437
- You should see my apartment.
- Whoa.

02:25.979 --> 02:29.733
Haven't even had our first date yet
and you're already inviting me in.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.735
Thought you were a nice girl.

02:31.818 --> 02:34.905
Oh, Michael, we all know
nice girls finish last.

02:36.448 --> 02:38.367
So where do you finish?

02:38.742 --> 02:41.244
It depends on where I start. Deep breath.

02:41.578 --> 02:42.746
(INHALING)

02:43.288 --> 02:44.498
Exhale.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.085
Inhale.

02:56.968 --> 03:00.180
- Sara, we're backing up out here.
- Right. I'm sorry.

03:04.059 --> 03:05.977
I'm going to get your shot.

03:42.806 --> 03:45.225
This is not what I signed on for.

03:45.434 --> 03:47.811
What do you want us to do?
You want us to wave the white flag?

03:47.894 --> 03:50.105
- Call a timeout?
- I just want to get Lincoln off death row.

03:50.188 --> 03:51.273
Lincoln?

03:51.356 --> 03:52.816
We just found out
that Vice President Reynolds

03:52.899 --> 03:54.568
funneled millions of dollars
in research grants

03:54.651 --> 03:56.153
into her brother's company.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.196
That money was filtered
into millions of small accounts

03:58.280 --> 04:01.158
that made millions of small donations
to her campaign

04:01.324 --> 04:03.535
setting her up to be the next
leader of the free world.

04:03.618 --> 04:06.997
I mean, this doesn't end with us
stopping an execution anymore.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.665
For me, it does.

04:29.352 --> 04:32.022
Okay, let's rotate.

04:33.064 --> 04:35.358
Sergeant Sodomy, you're up next.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.031
Yo. Come on.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.991
I don't know about you all,

04:44.576 --> 04:47.871
but this room is getting a little too dark
for me to dig.

04:49.247 --> 04:51.416
Now, are you telling me
that there's a hole in Fox River

04:51.500 --> 04:53.752
that you don't want to get into?

04:56.922 --> 04:58.632
Hey, no one gets hurt.

04:59.549 --> 05:01.676
You know, I got a question.

05:02.219 --> 05:05.430
Now, how come Fusilli over here
ain't grabbing a shovel?

05:05.514 --> 05:07.766
I'm handling arrangements on the outside.

05:07.849 --> 05:10.310
Really? So what is that,
transpo, paper, what?

05:10.393 --> 05:12.604
Exactly. It makes me management.

05:12.687 --> 05:14.940
And that makes us just labor, right?

05:15.023 --> 05:16.900
Now you're getting it.

05:18.652 --> 05:22.906
You know, management better keep
a close eye on the conditions up in here.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.408
Or the labor's liable to go on strike.
You feel me?

05:25.492 --> 05:26.785
Get back to work.

05:26.868 --> 05:28.829
Whoa, whoa, CO coming.

05:30.247 --> 05:31.581
Move it, guys.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.211
Come on, cover it up.

05:40.966 --> 05:42.884
Put that back up there.

05:45.971 --> 05:48.139
Scofield, move it.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.809
It's time for your conjugal.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.104
Your wife is here.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.647
So you're Mrs. Scofield.

06:38.315 --> 06:40.275
Have you done this before?

06:41.151 --> 06:43.069
Had a conjugal, I mean.

06:43.528 --> 06:44.571
No.

06:44.654 --> 06:47.866
Don't worry.
I'm just trying to make conversation.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.037
Clear.

06:57.208 --> 06:58.919
She look familiar to you?

06:59.502 --> 07:00.837
No, Captain.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.675
I know her from somewhere.

07:11.848 --> 07:13.016
You came.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.018
Of course.

07:16.019 --> 07:17.520
How have you been?

07:17.687 --> 07:20.023
Fine. I found a job.

07:20.899 --> 07:23.026
Good. I'm glad.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.780
Is it awful being here?

07:27.822 --> 07:31.701
Remember the first place you stayed?
That hotel by the airport?

07:32.911 --> 07:35.997
Only difference is $69
and the free shampoo.

07:37.374 --> 07:39.334
Always the brave face.

07:41.211 --> 07:43.213
You're still wearing it.

07:43.463 --> 07:44.798
Every day-

07:46.049 --> 07:47.592
I worry about you.

07:48.051 --> 07:49.052
Don't.

07:50.428 --> 07:53.056
Is there anything else that I can do?

07:53.264 --> 07:55.308
Just what we agreed on.

07:56.726 --> 07:59.521
I was so nervous
when they were checking.

08:00.689 --> 08:02.148
One question.

08:03.108 --> 08:05.944
Why would you need
a credit card in prison?

08:07.654 --> 08:09.406
See, I don't think
the riot changed anything.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.116
Have you seen the latest budget cuts
for this place?

08:11.199 --> 08:14.536
- Another 10% from health care.
- And 35% from prevention.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.746
He might be the governor,
but he's also your father.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.791
Maybe he thinks if he cuts enough
they can't afford you.

08:19.874 --> 08:21.126

this is standard procedure</i>

08:35.181 --> 08:37.392

08:37.475 --> 08:39.144
Never can be too careful.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.770
All right, bend over.

08:43.565 --> 08:47.110
You have a good time in the romper room
with that Euro?

08:47.444 --> 08:49.320
Whatever you say, boss.

08:50.113 --> 08:51.573
She come around here before?

08:51.656 --> 08:53.533
- First time.
- You sure?

08:53.908 --> 08:56.953
'Cause, damn if I don't recognize her
from somewhere.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.956
Maybe she visits some other con.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.333
Killing two birds with one bone.

09:02.417 --> 09:05.128
- Catching my drift?
- I wouldn't know.

09:06.004 --> 09:08.256
All right. He's clear, Captain.

09:08.339 --> 09:10.550
Make sure you take a shower, Scofield.

14:57.855 --> 15:00.149
to get Mr. Savrinn to a doctor.

15:02.360 --> 15:05.822
You decide whose life is more valuable.

it's all gone.

cleaned up your mess.

- Okay.

exactly what they know

- Well, speak of the devil.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.960
- Michael Scofield, David Apolskis.
- What's up?

17:24.460 --> 17:27.463
I seen you before, right?
You're part of that Pl crew.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.507
Maybe you can hook me up.

17:29.590 --> 17:32.134
You know, brother needs to make
some green, some cash-eesh.

17:32.218 --> 17:35.221
- You know what I'm saying?
- The pay is 19 cents an hour.

17:35.304 --> 17:38.224
19 cents? That's slavery, yo.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.184
It's prison, yo.

17:40.268 --> 17:42.979
And besides, Pl is all full up for now.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.440
All right, I feel you.

17:46.983 --> 17:50.319
But keep a brother in mind, all right?
If something opens up, you know?

17:50.403 --> 17:54.574
Hell, I'll pay 19 cents an hour to get me
some more time out the block.

17:55.449 --> 17:58.828

Already raised one.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.871
I'm too old to do it again.

18:00.955 --> 18:03.916
You ever hear of anything
being stolen from R&D?

18:04.000 --> 18:07.587
Of course.
Bulls steal from the personals all the time.

18:07.670 --> 18:11.591
Problem is, you never know what's gone
until you're on the outside of the walls.

18:11.674 --> 18:13.551
At that point,
you can't do anything about it.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.428
What if you knew now?

18:16.512 --> 18:17.888
Look, I told you,

18:17.972 --> 18:21.058
leave me out of whatever it is
you've got going.

18:21.142 --> 18:24.604
I just need to know if you've seen
a guard with a gold watch.

18:24.687 --> 18:27.565
There's a lot of people who can get you
a gold watch in here.

18:27.648 --> 18:30.359
Yeah, but I need this specific gold watch.

18:40.036 --> 18:41.996

18:42.079 --> 18:44.665
Word is he's the worst thief in here.

18:48.794 --> 18:51.380
My wife just faxed this over for you
from county records.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.382
Copy of Scofield's marriage license.

18:53.466 --> 18:56.260
- She says you owe her big time.
- Looks legit.

18:56.344 --> 18:59.096
He wasn't trying to sneak in
some whore for a conjugal.

18:59.180 --> 19:02.767
Says here they got married
the day before Scofield robbed that bank.

19:02.850 --> 19:05.061
Why the hell would he do that?

19:12.568 --> 19:15.404
- Heard from Veronica?
- No.

19:17.073 --> 19:20.117
Just a note from LJ saying he's with her,
that he was safe.

19:20.201 --> 19:22.161
But now it's been a while.

19:22.244 --> 19:23.996
Doesn't feel right.

19:24.538 --> 19:25.831
Feels wrong.

19:27.083 --> 19:28.125

19:28.209 --> 19:29.335

that either Miss Donovan and that boy

19:44.225 --> 19:47.770
don't like you very much, or
they have an unreasonable amount of faith

19:50.690 --> 19:53.818

20:08.457 --> 20:09.709
Mr. Savrinn,

20:09.792 --> 20:12.670
that bullet went through your teres major,

20:13.003 --> 20:14.755
ripped the lateral margin of your scapula,

20:14.839 --> 20:17.967
leaving you absolutely no medial rotation
of your arm.

20:18.050 --> 20:21.095

that piece of lumber at me,

- I wouldn't know.

21:09.518 --> 21:12.188

21:12.605 --> 21:14.190
All right, look, I need a favor.

that was stolen from me.

What kind of something we talking about?

21:24.158 --> 21:25.701
Just a watch.

-2003.

- There's a butterfly clasp on that bitch.
- Which means what?

Hidden deployment. There ain't no way
to snatch it without the mark feeling it.

21:49.225 --> 21:52.853

whimsical on this vicky.

that mean I get in on some of that Pl?

21:59.568 --> 22:02.488
It means I'll think about it. No promises.

- Doctors say a few weeks.

24:49.071 --> 24:51.949
she probably would've brought
this whole thing down already.

24:54.243 --> 24:56.787
But you know what the worst part is?

24:57.037 --> 24:59.081
That you dragged these people into this,

24:59.164 --> 25:02.334
knowing that you had no clue
how to get them out.

25:02.418 --> 25:04.586

minded your own business,

she wouldn't have a mouthful of maggots

Your fiancé would not be lying
in his apartment

to let the neighbors know

25:15.389 --> 25:18.058
that something had gone horribly wrong.

25:18.142 --> 25:21.061
That's right.

25:21.478 --> 25:25.691
You made this mess. Nobody else. You.

who else you've involved.

So you just nod,
and I'll know you're ready to talk.

25:48.881 --> 25:51.133
You know, Miss Donovan,

25:51.216 --> 25:54.136
I think that you look a little cold.

for the sake of titillation.

34:07.087 --> 34:09.505
Otherwise, your little visit to Fox River
this morning

34:09.589 --> 34:11.841
would've been breaking the law.

34:14.427 --> 34:16.221
Mrs. Scofield.

34:18.848 --> 34:22.018
We are married,
but they tell all the girls to lie.

34:22.101 --> 34:26.398
- It's better for making business.
- I'm not here to get you in trouble.

34:26.898 --> 34:30.277
I just want to know a little more
aboutyourhusband.

34:31.152 --> 34:33.737
- Well, he's a very good man.
- I'm sure he is.

34:33.822 --> 34:36.199
But even good men do bad things.

34:39.327 --> 34:42.496
Your accent. You're from... Don't tell me,

34:43.206 --> 34:45.333
- Budapest, right?
- Prague.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.002
Prague.

34:47.460 --> 34:51.505
How recently did you come over?
Only a couple of months, I bet.

34:52.465 --> 34:55.510
- You like it here in America?
- You know, I really have to keep moving.

34:55.594 --> 34:57.637
They don't like us to spend too much time
in one spot.

34:57.721 --> 35:01.057
Now, I don't want to have to
check into your immigration status.

35:03.018 --> 35:06.855
I just need to know what Michael Scofield
wanted from you

35:06.938 --> 35:09.190
in exchange for the green card.

35:10.442 --> 35:13.653
Nothing.
We met while he was studying overseas.

35:13.737 --> 35:16.865
I don't want to know what you
memorized for the INS.

35:16.990 --> 35:19.492
Now, either you answer my questions
about Scofield,

35:19.576 --> 35:22.329
or I call my guy in the Chicago PD.

35:22.704 --> 35:26.041
And maybe he starts asking
some questions about you.

35:30.545 --> 35:34.966
Credit card. He asked me
to bring him a credit card, that's it.

35:48.229 --> 35:49.648
(GROANING)

35:57.238 --> 35:58.573
(CELL PHONE DIALING)

36:01.409 --> 36:05.080
Yeah. Trace this call.
Come and get me now.

36:05.997 --> 36:08.291
New Glarus. I'm in New Glarus.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.769
No, thanks. I brought my own.

36:31.439 --> 36:34.984
Dorothy Andrews Elston Kabis.

36:35.443 --> 36:38.530
United States Treasurer in 1971,

36:38.780 --> 36:41.533
the year of the D.B. Cooper hijacking.

36:44.035 --> 36:47.580
DI 192589.

36:48.164 --> 36:52.460
The first number in the series of bills
used in the ransom drop.

36:54.129 --> 36:56.423
Thanks for the history lesson.

36:56.881 --> 37:00.593
All it proves is you did the research,
same as me.

37:40.800 --> 37:42.469
So you're married.

37:44.012 --> 37:47.056
Well, not in the traditional sense
of the word.

37:47.140 --> 37:50.101
Michael, we're both adults.
Put your cards on the table.

37:54.022 --> 37:55.815
Okay, I'll go first.

37:59.235 --> 38:00.987
As one of the very few women
around here,

38:01.070 --> 38:03.072
I'm used to a certain amount of

38:04.365 --> 38:07.786
innuendo and flirtation
being thrown my way.

38:10.163 --> 38:12.207
I'm not used to enjoying it.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.834
- Look, Sara...
- It's Dr. Tancredi.

38:14.918 --> 38:16.920
And please let me finish.

38:19.047 --> 38:22.133
I'm not a jealous woman,
but I'm a careful one.

38:23.134 --> 38:26.012
And for some reason,
when I'm around you I'm not careful.

38:26.095 --> 38:28.431
- You don't have to be.
- Yes, I do.

38:29.224 --> 38:32.477
There are so many questions
surrounding you, Michael.

38:32.685 --> 38:34.521
There are way too many.

38:35.563 --> 38:39.317
So here's the deal. From now on,

38:40.026 --> 38:42.362
your shots, any medical concerns,
they're all fine,

38:42.445 --> 38:43.905
as long as it's doctor-patient.

38:43.988 --> 38:46.950
But personal questions
and favors of any kind

38:47.033 --> 38:49.410
are no longer a part of our relationship.

38:51.955 --> 38:54.290
The questions you have about me.

38:56.751 --> 38:58.419
There are answers.

39:08.263 --> 39:09.514
Quinn!

39:09.931 --> 39:13.017
Hey, I was getting worried.
You guys get lost?

39:13.101 --> 39:16.396
We tried to call you again to pinpoint
your signal, but you never picked up.

39:16.479 --> 39:18.731
Yeah, the battery went dead
on the damn cell phone.

39:18.815 --> 39:22.360
- What are you gonna do, right?
- So, how'd it go?

39:22.443 --> 39:24.904
QUINN: Well, I got a broken leg down here.

39:24.988 --> 39:28.575
Yeah, listen, you know, I think
maybe we got off on the wrong foot.

39:28.658 --> 39:30.785
You got bosses, I got bosses,

39:30.869 --> 39:33.621
but at the end of the day
we're all on the same team, right?

39:33.705 --> 39:36.040
We're just trying to tie up
some loose ends.

39:36.124 --> 39:37.500
I could not agree more.

39:37.584 --> 39:41.337
Yeah, so could you guys get a rope
or a ladder or something?

39:46.259 --> 39:47.927
What the hell is that?

39:49.387 --> 39:51.264
Hey! Hey!

39:51.347 --> 39:54.142
- Just tying up some loose ends.
- You stupid son...

39:54.225 --> 39:57.896
Hey, guys, don't do this. Don't do this.

39:59.731 --> 40:02.984
Come on, please. My leg is broken.
I can't stand. You gotta help me.

40:03.067 --> 40:05.236
You can't just leave him down there.
He'll die.

40:05.320 --> 40:06.404
QUINN: I'm begging you, okay?

40:06.487 --> 40:07.614
He's the only one who knows

40:07.697 --> 40:10.241
we don't have the Burrows kid.
The only one.

40:10.325 --> 40:11.826
I got a family!

40:13.369 --> 40:16.789
Kellerman! Hale! Guys...

40:16.873 --> 40:18.458
There's room for you
down there, too, Danny.

40:18.541 --> 40:20.835
Don't do this. This is a big mistake.

40:22.337 --> 40:25.506
Don't leave me like this.
Don't leave me, please!

40:25.924 --> 40:27.133
Please!

40:33.139 --> 40:35.016
You coming back to Pl today?

40:35.099 --> 40:37.101
It's getting kind of testy in there,
you know?

40:37.185 --> 40:38.478
SCOFIELDI Yeah.

40:41.105 --> 40:44.901
- I just needed to find something out.
- What the hell is that?

40:45.151 --> 40:46.361
Listen.

40:49.530 --> 40:51.157
(TAPE HISSING)

40:52.825 --> 40:56.412
- Am I supposed to be hearing something?
-(SHUSHING) Just hold on.

40:57.705 --> 40:59.540
(TAPE CONTINUES HISSING)

41:09.759 --> 41:11.469
(METALLIC CLANKING)

41:13.304 --> 41:15.390
- There.
- What?

41:16.057 --> 41:18.184
We sat around here for 20 minutes
waiting to hear that?

41:18.267 --> 41:20.228
Eighteen minutes, actually.

41:20.603 --> 41:22.021
And yes.

41:23.564 --> 41:25.441
- What was it?
- Keys.

41:26.317 --> 41:29.821
The guards' keys.
Eighteen minutes is how long we have

41:29.904 --> 41:32.699
between each time the guards pass
beneath the infirmary windows

41:32.782 --> 41:36.452
on their rounds at night.
Cons aren't allowed outside after-hours.

41:36.536 --> 41:38.538
It was the only way
I could find out the timing.

41:38.621 --> 41:40.832
- What does that mean?
- It means

41:42.375 --> 41:44.752
four days from now,
on the night of the escape,

41:44.836 --> 41:47.714
we'll have 18 minutes to get the bars off
the infirmary window

41:47.797 --> 41:51.676
and for all seven of us
to get across the wire and over the wall.

41:51.759 --> 41:53.928
- Is that doable?
- Of course.

42:08.609 --> 42:11.404
- What's up?
- Nothing.

42:11.821 --> 42:14.073
Hey, I know that look. What's up?

42:14.782 --> 42:16.534
I hit it! I hit it!

42:19.287 --> 42:20.455
SUCRE: The pipe!

42:21.581 --> 42:23.082
LINCOLN: Guys, guys.

42:24.709 --> 42:26.586
All right, all right, give him some room.

42:30.131 --> 42:33.384
- Come on, Michael, talk to me.
- Want the good news or the bad news?

42:33.468 --> 42:37.096
- The good.
- Westmoreland and his money are in.

42:37.847 --> 42:40.308
- What's the bad?
- I've done the math.

42:40.391 --> 42:42.685
I figure it'll take at least five minutes
for us

42:42.769 --> 42:44.854
to get the bars off the window
in the infirmary

42:44.937 --> 42:48.441
and two minutes for each of us
to get across the wire and over the wall.

42:48.524 --> 42:50.943
- So?
- We've only got 18 minutes.

42:52.487 --> 42:54.322
We've got too many people.

42:55.156 --> 42:56.657
That's it. That's it.

42:57.533 --> 42:59.577
And one of them has to go.
