I know it's been a long time since we talked.

04:38.737 --> 04:40.410
Sorry about that.

04:40.405 --> 04:43.033
But, well, maybe if you don't want to talk,

04:43.033 --> 04:44.410
you could just listen.

04:44.910 --> 04:48.130
Moe told me if I do this thing,
I'll be a grown-up,

04:48.497 --> 04:50.545
and that sounds cool, I guess.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.761

the playground all by myself.</i>

at the store, if I was grown.</i>

and Jake still love me?</i>

your body, or also your soul?

05:57.482 --> 06:00.110
Finn, all this is
heck of awkward without Beemo.

06:00.318 --> 06:02.241
Way more awkward than I thought it'd be.

06:02.487 --> 06:04.615
I think maybe I don't like old people.

I'm gonna get old one day, too.

You can't do that, it's rude.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.631

06:17.711 --> 06:19.213
She's way old, and you like her.

06:19.504 --> 06:21.381
Yeah, but she listens to music.

06:21.506 --> 06:22.883
Moe probably only, like,

06:22.883 --> 06:25.261
listens to the sound of the earth decaying.

Come on, you're being weird.

my computing power is unmatched.

12:57.694 --> 12:59.947
I can only see the world as it is.

All right. You see that hatch over there?

As you were built to give love,

14:51.808 --> 14:53.685
Amo was built to receive.

14:53.810 --> 14:56.188
But he could not think
outside his programming

14:56.396 --> 14:58.069
and was blinded by his need.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.316
Such is the cruel physics of love

15:00.566 --> 15:02.944
that those who crave it most will repel it

15:03.277 --> 15:05.655
and only the dang rich get richer.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.324
Well, maybe as my birthday present,

15:08.533 --> 15:10.535
I can ask Moe to fix Amo.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.329
But this is impossible.

15:12.453 --> 15:14.831
Moe went off line yesterday

15:28.845 --> 15:30.062
No. (LAUGHS)

15:30.304 --> 15:31.351
Phew!

15:31.347 --> 15:35.193
(LAUGHS) He had a huge, gigantic wig on.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.353

15:37.603 --> 15:39.355
