02:12.120 --> 02:13.300
morning,chief.

02:14.530 --> 02:15.880
Sergeant.

02:17.100 --> 02:19.710
One of the divers repairing docks out here

02:19.790 --> 02:21.780
saw something trapped under the floaters.

02:22.090 --> 02:23.450
Went in for a closer look,

02:24.210 --> 02:26.000
turned out to be two dead bodies.

02:26.670 --> 02:29.410
Harbor division's taking
the guy's statement right now

02:31.210 --> 02:32.760
No I.D. Anywhere.

02:33.420 --> 02:34.950
And from the rate of slippage,

02:35.020 --> 02:38.690
I'd say the bodies had been
in this water for about two weeks

02:39.410 --> 02:43.620
So we can't even say anything
definite about their race or sex.

02:43.730 --> 02:46.590
But considering what was left of their clothes,

02:46.680 --> 02:49.000
I'd say we're probably dealing with an adult woman

02:49.820 --> 02:51.870
and a 4 to 6-year-old girl.

02:53.060 --> 02:54.150
Tied together.

02:54.450 --> 02:55.770
Might be mother and daughter.

02:56.210 --> 02:57.970
We found a diving belt beneath them.

02:58.340 --> 03:01.130
Might have slipped off as they decomposed

03:01.240 --> 03:04.300
or didn't have enough weight
to counteract the gasses as they bloated

03:04.730 --> 03:06.260
And the little girl's knapsack...

03:07.700 --> 03:08.870
looks to be from japan.

03:08.950 --> 03:10.060
Thank you,commander.

03:10.120 --> 03:12.540
And,harbor division will be staying here?

03:12.600 --> 03:13.930
Until you're through.
Yes,ma'am.

03:14.100 --> 03:15.050
Thank you.

03:17.210 --> 03:18.920
Ok,lieutenant flynn.

03:19.010 --> 03:21.330
This is a nasty piece of work,
but let's get to it.

03:21.530 --> 03:24.690
I didn't see any civilian vehicle
in the immediate vicinity.

03:24.780 --> 03:27.450
Let's see if any were towed
from here in the last 30 days.

03:27.820 --> 03:29.270
Detective daniels and sergeant--

03:30.890 --> 03:33.010
no. Detective sanchez.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.110
Let's talk to the owners
of these boats,please,

03:35.200 --> 03:37.760
and get background checks on
whoever has been using the slips here

03:37.960 --> 03:39.000
Sergeant gabriel,

03:39.070 --> 03:40.860
if you could get the ball
rolling with missing persons

03:40.940 --> 03:41.920
Thank you.

03:46.520 --> 03:47.590
Chief.

03:47.720 --> 03:48.500
I just saw the bodies,

03:48.610 --> 03:50.170
and they are literally falling apart.

03:50.290 --> 03:51.250
Best to get them over

03:51.340 --> 03:53.160
to dental x-ray as quickly as possible.

03:56.150 --> 03:56.940
Chief...

03:57.420 --> 03:58.420
Honestly...

03:59.420 --> 04:01.110
there's nothing to see.

04:02.920 --> 04:04.730
I have to look at them anyway.

04:05.110 --> 04:06.140
Thank you,lieutenant.

04:07.980 --> 04:09.040
Could you please make sure

04:09.140 --> 04:11.530
all their personal effects
make it to the murder room

04:11.820 --> 04:13.470
I want that little girl's knapsack

04:13.550 --> 04:15.300
gone over with a fine-tooth comb.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.370
Lieutenant tao.

04:27.910 --> 04:28.900
Go ahead.

04:49.520 --> 04:50.950
Where are the adult's shoes?

04:51.300 --> 04:52.210
Not found.

04:52.620 --> 04:54.520
Maybe she kicked them off before she jumped in.

04:54.640 --> 04:56.390
Why,she wasn't going for a swim.

04:57.700 --> 05:00.570
Bits of her dress floated down
to the bottom but not her shoes?

05:03.690 --> 05:05.010
Lieutenant tao.

05:05.090 --> 05:07.820
Why did commander taylor
seem to be briefing you instead of me

05:07.900 --> 05:10.200
when he was talking about
how the bodies were tied together?

05:12.080 --> 05:13.440
Oyaka-shinju.

05:15.620 --> 05:19.490
Oyaka-shinju is a form of
japanese murder/suicide

05:19.900 --> 05:21.920
Usually when a mother kills herself.

05:22.010 --> 05:23.130
Takes her child with her.

05:24.150 --> 05:28.120
Taylor's father had a similar case down
by the santa monica pier back in the '70s

05:31.160 --> 05:33.020
Oyaka-shinju.
Is it...

05:33.330 --> 05:34.660
is it common?

05:34.810 --> 05:36.160
It's not unheard of.

05:36.590 --> 05:38.030
Usually a spate of them together.

05:38.580 --> 05:39.990
Like after world war ii.

05:40.380 --> 05:42.480
Widows hurled themselves off mountains

05:42.500 --> 05:43.500
tied to their daughters

05:43.580 --> 05:46.180
because they were told americans would rape them.

05:48.070 --> 05:49.560
Well,I always thought...

05:50.280 --> 05:51.770
you're chinese,aren't you?

05:52.200 --> 05:53.250
Yeah.

05:53.620 --> 05:54.960
Japanese wife.

05:59.400 --> 06:00.210
Surgeon's knots.

06:03.830 --> 06:05.980
Nylon cord.
Lasts longer than flesh.

06:11.950 --> 06:13.410
Might have stayed down there forever

06:13.490 --> 06:15.810
if this weight belt hadn't slipped off.

06:18.640 --> 06:19.610
Lieutenant tao,

06:19.730 --> 06:21.330
could you please go with the bodies to the morgue?

06:21.410 --> 06:23.610
Make sure that they get moved through quickly.

06:23.810 --> 06:24.960
Sure thing,chief.

07:14.830 --> 07:15.900
Hey,chief.

07:21.550 --> 07:23.950
so nothing's been towed
from here in over a year

07:24.520 --> 07:26.190
And this is off the bus route,too.

07:27.680 --> 07:29.350
So how did she get here?

07:30.540 --> 07:32.900
With a child carrying a diving belt.

07:33.900 --> 07:35.290
Without shoes.

07:39.690 --> 07:40.890
Let's check the...

07:41.440 --> 07:43.470
cab companies and car services please

07:43.550 --> 07:45.010
because whoever she was,

07:45.730 --> 07:48.330
she didn't walk here barefoot
all the way from japan.

07:53.430 --> 07:54.590
Japan?

07:54.910 --> 07:55.810
Ta-

07:55.940 --> 07:56.980
ka-

07:57.110 --> 07:58.430
ash-

07:58.610 --> 08:00.080
I-

08:00.310 --> 08:01.210
a-

08:01.520 --> 08:02.320
ko.

08:02.470 --> 08:04.320
Takahashao.

08:04.780 --> 08:06.160
Here. Let me look at it.

08:06.260 --> 08:07.290
Oh,yeah,like you could say it better.

08:07.390 --> 08:08.840
Get your ass off my desk.

08:09.090 --> 08:11.110
Lieutenant provenza found a boarding pass

08:11.200 --> 08:13.720
folded up in a coin purse
in the little girl's knapsack.

08:13.830 --> 08:15.560
Flight number,date,airline.

08:15.640 --> 08:17.520
Except,all the names run together.

08:17.590 --> 08:19.730
We don't know where the first one ends,
and the last name begins.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.790
Airline says it was leg one
of a round-trip ticket

08:21.870 --> 08:24.050
except we can't get the entry forms from customs

08:24.110 --> 08:25.920
'cause we can't spell the name properly.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.200
Where was she coming in from?

08:27.330 --> 08:28.590
Narita international.

08:28.670 --> 08:30.020
It's tokyo.

08:30.420 --> 08:32.870
-Any update on the bodies yet?
-Got the dental work done,

08:32.950 --> 08:35.090
but they had been underwater too long
to determine how they died

08:35.200 --> 08:36.970
Maybe drowned,maybe dead when they hit the water.

08:37.110 --> 08:38.230
Can't tell.

08:38.380 --> 08:39.860
But I can help you with this though.

08:39.950 --> 08:40.880
Looks like...

08:40.900 --> 08:42.450
two names run together.

08:42.530 --> 08:43.490
Whose is it?

08:43.620 --> 08:44.730
He thinks the little girl'S.

08:45.250 --> 08:47.680
surnames go first in china,

08:47.860 --> 08:49.090
japan,korea.

08:49.160 --> 08:50.810
Like flynn,andy.

08:51.030 --> 08:52.040
Johnson,brenda.

08:55.310 --> 08:56.100
See?

08:56.200 --> 08:57.250
Takahashi

08:57.300 --> 09:00.020
is a name associated with the prefecture of tokyo.

09:00.100 --> 09:01.550
Last name takahashi.

09:01.770 --> 09:05.170
T-a-k-a-h-a-s-h-I.

09:05.320 --> 09:07.210
Given name,misspelled.

09:07.760 --> 09:09.620
Needs an "I."

09:10.940 --> 09:12.580
Aiko takahashi.

09:12.730 --> 09:15.500
First name,aiko.
A-I-k-O.

09:15.570 --> 09:16.590
Probably tourists.

09:16.650 --> 09:19.690
Why would a mother fly from tokyo to los angeles

09:19.770 --> 09:21.980
on a round-trip ticket to commit suicide?

09:22.960 --> 09:25.180
Any indication on how she got to wharf street yet?

09:25.270 --> 09:27.010
No car service,no cab,no limo.

09:27.110 --> 09:28.770
Customs.
Customs is faxing.

09:28.820 --> 09:29.600
Yes.

09:29.670 --> 09:33.090
The form will read traveled with yumi takahashi.

09:33.310 --> 09:35.470
Y-u-m-I. Age 28.

09:35.560 --> 09:36.900
Aiko,her daughter,4.

09:36.990 --> 09:38.910
Ok,the custom form lists the residence

09:38.960 --> 09:40.460
where they said
they were staying during their trip

09:40.540 --> 09:43.440
In the 90048 zip code and a phone number.

09:43.520 --> 09:44.680
Maybe they have family here.

09:44.900 --> 09:46.320
Let me do a master inquiry on that.

09:46.470 --> 09:47.810
She has a house in L.A.,

09:48.010 --> 09:50.300
How come she has round-trip tickets back to tokyo?

09:50.360 --> 09:52.180
And why hasn't anyone reported her missing,

09:52.260 --> 09:53.420
or the little girl?

09:53.670 --> 09:56.040
Yumi takahashi has a california driver's license,

09:56.130 --> 09:57.950
a silver camry registered in her name.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.640
Same address listed on her customs form.

10:00.780 --> 10:01.770
Owns the house.

10:02.370 --> 10:04.070
License plate's coming up.

10:04.150 --> 10:05.370
She lives here.

10:05.440 --> 10:06.440
Not anymore.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.600
Ok,let's do it like this.

10:08.670 --> 10:11.070
First,if she was flying back to tokyo,

10:11.150 --> 10:14.100
we may be looking for the missing persons
report in the wrong country.

10:14.310 --> 10:15.310
Detective daniels,

10:15.390 --> 10:18.100
let's see if anyone reported our victims
missing in japan.

10:18.180 --> 10:21.210
Detective sanchez,get the plates of the car
and the picture off her license

10:21.280 --> 10:22.890
and start dragging the airport security cameras.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.520
Remember,she had a little girl with her.

10:24.780 --> 10:25.940
I want a background check on yumi.

10:26.020 --> 10:29.010
Credit cards,schools,criminal records,
whatever you can find.

10:29.210 --> 10:30.220
Sergeant gabriel,

10:30.320 --> 10:31.550
let's pay a visit to her house.

10:31.650 --> 10:33.960
Lieutenant flynn,if you and lieutenant provenza

10:34.050 --> 10:36.280
could follow behind us and a little out of sight

10:36.360 --> 10:37.940
in case no one's home when we drop by.

10:38.120 --> 10:39.240
Thank you.

10:48.740 --> 10:50.510
We're stopping at the end of the block.

10:50.590 --> 10:51.740
How far away are you?

10:51.820 --> 10:52.860
We're about 3 doors down.

10:53.470 --> 10:54.940
Look,that's yumi's camry

10:54.990 --> 10:57.350
pulling out,right there.

11:00.950 --> 11:02.270
What do you want me to do?

11:02.700 --> 11:04.180
Turn around and follow him.

11:07.710 --> 11:08.460
You guys,be advised,

11:08.520 --> 11:12.420
we have an unidentified white male subject
driving the victim's car from the house.

11:12.490 --> 11:13.520
We're on them now.

11:13.580 --> 11:15.320
Someone might be stealing that car.

11:15.390 --> 11:17.170
Should we come in closer or stay back?

11:17.250 --> 11:18.010
Just sit tight.

11:18.070 --> 11:19.500
Let's see where he's going first.

11:19.870 --> 11:21.230
Maybe we should pull him over.

11:21.310 --> 11:22.660
No. Not yet.

11:22.730 --> 11:23.900
I don't know who he is.

11:23.970 --> 11:25.950
He could be a relative.

11:26.000 --> 11:26.880
He could be her husband.

11:26.900 --> 11:27.960
He could be anybody.

11:38.810 --> 11:39.820
Could be chopping it.

11:39.950 --> 11:42.500
He gets out and goes inside,
it might be our last time to see him.

11:42.630 --> 11:44.300
Don't say anything about homicide.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.560
For the time being,we're just regular lapd.

11:50.570 --> 11:52.850
-Uh,excuse me,sir.
-Lapd,sir.

11:52.930 --> 11:54.760
May we see your driver's license please.

11:56.380 --> 11:57.700
Sure. Yeah. Uh...

11:59.110 --> 12:00.890
I believe I was driving the speed limit.

12:01.630 --> 12:02.870
Yes. You were,

12:02.940 --> 12:04.300
mr...andrews,

12:04.370 --> 12:07.110
but you were driving the speed limit
in a car registered to someone else

12:07.170 --> 12:09.110
and you were taking it to a body shop

12:09.180 --> 12:12.270
which is the preferred destination
of most stolen vehicles

12:13.290 --> 12:15.600
Yes,but this car belongs to my wife,

12:15.740 --> 12:19.220
and this particular body shop
happens to be my business

12:19.300 --> 12:20.480
I own it,so...

12:20.600 --> 12:21.780
nothing to worry about there.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.190
I see.

12:23.820 --> 12:25.370
Well,if we could talk to your wife,

12:25.480 --> 12:26.860
I'm sure we could clear this up.

12:26.930 --> 12:28.550
Oh,I'm sorry.She's in japan.

12:29.360 --> 12:31.870
But I can get her registration
and the insurance

12:31.950 --> 12:34.450
I'd prefer if you didn't attempt
to get back in the car,sir

12:39.590 --> 12:41.720
Your wife kept her own name?

12:42.040 --> 12:43.460
Uh...yes.

12:44.220 --> 12:46.340
Yes,she did.
What are we doing here?

12:48.300 --> 12:50.880
This is probably a huge waste of time,

12:50.920 --> 12:55.510
but the lapd is conducting
a search of area chop shops

12:55.600 --> 12:58.450
and whenever we find someone
in a car other than their own

12:58.610 --> 13:00.960
we are required to impound the vehicle

13:01.050 --> 13:02.410
and bring the driver
downtown for questioning

13:02.500 --> 13:03.710
You're kidding.

13:03.890 --> 13:06.920
It's just until we can determine
official ownership of the vehicle,sir

13:06.990 --> 13:09.690
I mean,you'd be surprised
how many people lie to us on a given day

13:10.220 --> 13:12.450
But I could just show you
my wife's registration

13:12.510 --> 13:14.880
Would you happen to have your
marriage license handy,too,sir?

13:17.160 --> 13:18.470
No. I'm afraid I don'T.

13:18.530 --> 13:19.700
Look,um...

13:20.860 --> 13:22.860
I know these chop shops can be a bother,

13:22.940 --> 13:26.160
but I have 100 percent
cooperation record with the lapd

13:26.230 --> 13:27.840
If you don't mind just checking your files.

13:27.930 --> 13:29.370
I'm sure none of this would be necessary.

13:29.440 --> 13:30.780
I'm afraid it is,sir.

13:30.860 --> 13:32.040
I apologize.

13:32.620 --> 13:34.670
We can get this fixed up in a minute.I promisE.

13:36.860 --> 13:38.080
Better safe than sorry,

13:38.130 --> 13:39.520
I suppose.

13:40.160 --> 13:43.570
It's all right if I step inside
and tell my assistant I'll be missing lunch?

13:46.960 --> 13:48.090
Go right ahead,sir.

13:48.210 --> 13:49.880
All right.

14:07.220 --> 14:09.310
The japanese consulate is working on

14:09.410 --> 14:10.890
getting us the dental records.

14:11.910 --> 14:13.080
All I've told them so far

14:13.170 --> 14:14.490
is that the victims drowned.

14:15.190 --> 14:16.170
We don't know that.

14:16.270 --> 14:17.330
We can't say what happened to them.

14:17.380 --> 14:18.280
Right,so,

14:18.300 --> 14:20.020
why have you brought the husband in already

14:20.090 --> 14:21.810
and put him in an interview room?

14:21.870 --> 14:23.680
Don't you want a definite id on the victims

14:23.780 --> 14:25.170
before you start asking andrews questions?

14:25.220 --> 14:26.940
Well,of course,
that's what I want

14:27.490 --> 14:29.480
Frankly,it seems to me
we don't even know enough yet

14:29.560 --> 14:31.530
to tell him that yumi and aiko are dead.

14:31.670 --> 14:33.670
Let alone treat him like a suspect.

14:34.350 --> 14:35.800
It's completely backwards,will.

14:35.890 --> 14:37.160
Is that what you want me to say?

14:37.350 --> 14:40.130
Normally,we get notified by a relative
that people are missing

14:40.200 --> 14:41.720
and we search until we find the bodies,

14:41.800 --> 14:43.150
now we're finding the bodies

14:43.230 --> 14:44.740
checking to see
if anyone's reported them missing

14:44.820 --> 14:47.350
while searching for a relative to notify.

14:47.430 --> 14:49.350
It's...it's out of order.

14:51.030 --> 14:54.400
But andrews is driving his wife's car to work.

14:54.730 --> 14:56.570
Do we arrest people for that now?

14:56.690 --> 14:58.530
I didn't arrest him.
I brought him in for questioning.

14:58.560 --> 14:59.830
And what did you want me to do,will?

14:59.890 --> 15:02.350
What if he's guilty of the murder
of his wife and child?

15:02.470 --> 15:03.740
What if he's not?

15:03.810 --> 15:05.100
Shouldn't he know what's going on?

15:05.480 --> 15:06.480
Look,

15:06.890 --> 15:08.660
I'm just stalling the notification

15:08.780 --> 15:10.300
until I get a match on the dental records.

15:10.370 --> 15:11.800
So please,just don'T...

15:12.130 --> 15:14.460
don't tell me how to run this case.

15:19.610 --> 15:22.930
So lax has got no record
of yummi takahashi--

15:23.010 --> 15:24.150
yumi.

15:24.400 --> 15:25.650
Yumi.

15:25.760 --> 15:29.220
Takahashi's car going into
or out of the airport

15:29.330 --> 15:30.590
Ok.

15:31.670 --> 15:34.590
I need you to check
terminal security tapes yourself

15:34.780 --> 15:37.470
According to the airline,
they had three bags checked through

15:37.530 --> 15:40.170
Mr. Andrews here might have been
waiting for them at the luggage carousel

15:41.800 --> 15:42.690
Lieutenant provenza,

15:42.760 --> 15:45.860
we need to find out if yumi and aiko
ever made it to their house

15:46.010 --> 15:47.600
Check the car services,shuttles,

15:47.820 --> 15:49.540
horse and buggies running
from the airport

15:49.640 --> 15:50.670
Someone picked them up.

15:51.250 --> 15:52.350
Lieutenant flynn,

15:52.440 --> 15:54.940
I need you to execute a search
warrant of yumi's house

15:55.160 --> 15:56.190
What am I looking for?

15:56.290 --> 15:57.640
Everything.

15:58.140 --> 15:59.430
Their luggage.

15:59.520 --> 16:01.210
Information related to their travel.

16:01.290 --> 16:02.310
Suicide note.

16:02.490 --> 16:05.380
Also,these are pictures
that lieutenant tao took of

16:05.450 --> 16:07.620
what we dredged up
from the harbor around the bodies

16:07.740 --> 16:10.150
See if you can find a mate to that lamp.

16:10.200 --> 16:11.810
Another striped sleeping bag.

16:12.130 --> 16:13.450
Computer that goes with this monitor.

16:13.540 --> 16:14.910
-You got it.
-Thank you.

16:15.800 --> 16:16.940
Sergeant gabriel,

16:17.010 --> 16:19.800
I want a complete criminal
background check on paul andrews

16:19.880 --> 16:21.480
If he was sent to the principal's office,

16:21.580 --> 16:23.380
for chewing gum,I want to know about it.

16:23.550 --> 16:25.940
Uh,I want the rest of you to stay close by.

16:26.110 --> 16:27.320
In case stuff comes up in there

16:27.400 --> 16:29.280
that I need you to follow up on.

16:29.630 --> 16:30.950
And buzz,

16:31.060 --> 16:33.020
I want every update as it comes in.

16:33.110 --> 16:34.470
Yes,ma'am.

16:50.950 --> 16:52.190
I'm sorry.

16:53.490 --> 16:55.180
On top of everything else,

16:55.260 --> 16:56.550
our computers are down.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.550
Huh,naturally.

16:59.830 --> 17:01.300
And I have to,um...

17:01.520 --> 17:03.800
this is a bit of a bureaucratic boilerplate,

17:03.870 --> 17:04.829
but,um,

17:04.910 --> 17:05.940
I have to say it.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.300
You have the right to an attorney.

17:07.369 --> 17:08.710
If you can't afford an attorney,

17:08.780 --> 17:10.260
the state will provide you with one.

17:10.460 --> 17:12.500
Also,you have the right to remain silent.

17:12.579 --> 17:15.300
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law

17:15.619 --> 17:17.020
Do you understand these rights?

17:17.119 --> 17:18.400
I didn'T.

17:18.589 --> 17:20.980
Are you really gonna arrest me
for driving my wife's car to work?

17:21.200 --> 17:23.020
Well,no,but,uh...

17:24.170 --> 17:26.310
if you could put us in touch with her,

17:27.190 --> 17:28.660
that would save a lot of time.

17:29.590 --> 17:32.300
Finding yumi's a bit more
on your shoulders than mine

17:32.720 --> 17:36.050
I talked to the lapd several times
last february asking for help with that

17:36.140 --> 17:37.470
I was told there's nothing you can do.

17:37.650 --> 17:38.990
Oh,really,why is that?

17:39.240 --> 17:41.980
Well,apparently,you have no legal
authority in these situations

17:42.070 --> 17:43.310
What kind of situations?

17:44.440 --> 17:46.730
Well,I'll just go over
the whole thing again then,shall I?

17:50.540 --> 17:52.690
I left home for work

17:53.130 --> 17:54.660
6 months ago one morning,

17:54.760 --> 17:57.570
and when I got back,yumi had packed up

17:57.850 --> 18:00.160
and gone with my daughter to japan.

18:01.500 --> 18:02.920
-You reported her missing?
-No,no.

18:02.990 --> 18:04.330
I reported her gone.

18:04.480 --> 18:05.540
She left a note.

18:05.630 --> 18:08.710
She said she had no choice
but to raise our child in tokyo

18:09.900 --> 18:11.010
She's an adult,

18:11.080 --> 18:11.920
of course.

18:11.990 --> 18:13.530
She can change her mind
about her marriage

18:13.590 --> 18:15.090
People do,but...

18:15.930 --> 18:17.420
taking our daughter with her.

18:18.070 --> 18:19.450
I thought that was illegal.

18:20.530 --> 18:22.610
But...it's not.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.070
'Cause I'm not a U.S. Citizen.

18:25.510 --> 18:28.290
Which incidentally is
why the car is still in yumi's name

18:28.380 --> 18:29.750
House and business,too.

18:30.090 --> 18:31.900
I'm so sorry about your trouble

18:32.220 --> 18:33.430
and that you have to

18:33.940 --> 18:35.770
make all these payments

18:36.010 --> 18:37.410
for things you don't own.

18:37.740 --> 18:39.180
Not to have anything that's yours.

18:39.270 --> 18:41.210
Ll,that's not exactly true.

18:41.530 --> 18:44.690
I do have my own storage facility.
A rather large one.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.810
The garage just got too small for our cars,

18:47.910 --> 18:49.050
and my past lives,

18:49.120 --> 18:51.830
so I boxed myself up on sunset boulevard.

18:52.350 --> 18:54.880
Detective daniels has a storage facility,

18:54.990 --> 18:57.240
and she tells me whenever
she needs to find something

18:57.290 --> 18:59.940
she has to nearly take the entire day
off to sort through it all

19:00.030 --> 19:01.090
Yeah.

19:01.290 --> 19:04.370
Yeah,well. You have to be organized about it.

19:04.430 --> 19:05.820
Daniels is going for a warrant.

19:07.440 --> 19:08.730
So,um...

19:10.040 --> 19:12.070
you couldn't talk your wife
into coming back home?

19:12.220 --> 19:14.700
No,I haven't talked to her at all.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.170
I called her parents.

19:16.430 --> 19:18.610
They insist that they don't know where she is.

19:18.710 --> 19:19.610
They're lying,

19:19.710 --> 19:20.890
of course.

19:21.110 --> 19:22.670
What can I do?

19:23.990 --> 19:26.050
Right,right. I know.
Not your problem.

19:26.100 --> 19:28.170
British consulate said
it couldn't do anything either

19:28.490 --> 19:31.870
Lieutenant tao here has good relations
with the british consulate

19:32.470 --> 19:35.260
Might be able to push things through
when we're done here

19:35.430 --> 19:36.840
I'm on it.

19:38.780 --> 19:41.250
Lieutenant tao is checking
with the consulate right now

19:42.130 --> 19:43.660
Do you suppose it would do any good?

19:43.750 --> 19:46.080
I mean,they couldn't care less
about me if I was french

19:47.370 --> 19:48.740
We'll see what we can do.

19:50.520 --> 19:52.520
That certainly would be ironic,wouldn't it?

19:52.700 --> 19:53.870
After all this.

19:53.950 --> 19:55.540
I mean,I'm only here today

19:55.590 --> 19:57.650
because I took yumi's car
to work instead of mine

19:58.340 --> 20:00.680
I thought you said you didn't own anything.

20:00.810 --> 20:02.370
Oh,I don'T. It's leased.

20:02.870 --> 20:04.150
A mercedes.

20:04.250 --> 20:05.990
Yumi's family were coming last year,

20:06.050 --> 20:07.770
and I wanted to impress them.

20:08.550 --> 20:10.100
A lot of good that did.

20:10.240 --> 20:11.500
What...

20:12.690 --> 20:13.940
I hear a buzzing sound.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.180
Do you hear a buzz?

20:15.260 --> 20:17.140
Getting detective sanchez right now.

20:17.230 --> 20:19.580
I assume you want him to
run the mercedes plates around the airport?

20:19.660 --> 20:20.390
I'm sorry.

20:20.520 --> 20:21.640
What were we,um...

20:22.150 --> 20:24.080
oh,right. Yumi's parents.

20:24.180 --> 20:25.680
They came and they didn't like you.

20:25.910 --> 20:26.890
No.

20:26.930 --> 20:29.040
Nothing I said was good enough for her father.

20:29.890 --> 20:31.650
And yumi seemed ashamed of me.

20:33.500 --> 20:34.760
Frankly,I'm so angry at her

20:34.920 --> 20:36.990
I don't even know if I want to speak to her again.

20:38.770 --> 20:40.780
But my daughter is so young.

20:41.150 --> 20:45.070
She's just 2 weeks and 2 days shy
of her 5th birthday

20:47.940 --> 20:50.200
Every day she's gone,I can feel her just...

20:50.840 --> 20:52.130
forgetting me.

20:52.760 --> 20:53.950
What's her name?

20:54.140 --> 20:55.300
Aiko.

20:56.250 --> 20:57.390
Got a picture.

20:58.600 --> 20:59.960
Or two.

21:01.230 --> 21:02.690
My little charmer.

21:03.530 --> 21:04.740
There she is.

21:06.110 --> 21:07.510
Boy trouble.

21:07.960 --> 21:09.890
That's my prediction for her.

21:11.340 --> 21:12.880
Look at that smile.

21:18.760 --> 21:21.420
I kept the letter

21:21.630 --> 21:23.760
yumi wrote me saying good bye.

21:34.390 --> 21:37.450
So andrews has no criminal record in the states,

21:37.570 --> 21:40.590
and ins gave him a clean bill of health
when he applied for his visa

21:40.820 --> 21:41.980
Did you find anything on him?

21:42.480 --> 21:44.300
His story about the british consulate checks out.

21:45.100 --> 21:46.220
And the guy I talked to there said

21:46.270 --> 21:48.120
andrews was so insistent
about getting his daughter back

21:48.190 --> 21:51.450
they actually had the family contacted
by their ambassador to japan

21:51.870 --> 21:53.480
But the takahashis insisted

21:53.800 --> 21:55.250
they didn't know where there daughter was.

21:55.780 --> 21:57.040
Now,see,then that's funny

21:57.120 --> 21:58.310
because it was the father

21:58.600 --> 22:01.130
who reported yumi and aiko missing 5 days ago

22:01.190 --> 22:02.410
when they didn't come back from L.A.

22:02.520 --> 22:04.290
So she had been in japan.

22:04.500 --> 22:06.160
Yeah,and now she's in the morgue.

22:06.260 --> 22:08.100
Aiko and yumi's dental records.

22:08.310 --> 22:09.570
Perfect match.

22:09.670 --> 22:10.530
Oh,and sergeant,

22:10.630 --> 22:12.360
please inform her ladyship

22:12.460 --> 22:15.420
that I can't find any transport
for these two from the airport

22:18.460 --> 22:19.650
That's horrible.

22:20.700 --> 22:22.960
That's horrible to leave a letter like this.

22:25.320 --> 22:27.260
Yumi should've spoken to you in person.

22:29.960 --> 22:31.520
You carry it around with you.

22:32.870 --> 22:34.250
Do you find that odd?

22:35.650 --> 22:36.770
Maybe it is.

22:39.460 --> 22:42.180
Still,it might be the last
I ever hear from her

22:44.010 --> 22:45.280
I don't know.

22:46.080 --> 22:47.380
Even though it is

22:47.640 --> 22:49.160
rather unkind

22:49.850 --> 22:52.600
I can't bring myself to part with it.

22:55.630 --> 22:57.150
I wonder if we made the right decision.

22:57.230 --> 22:58.470
Hey,chief.

22:58.520 --> 23:00.410
We got a match on the dental
records from the morgue

23:00.480 --> 23:02.650
It is this guy's wife and daughter,

23:02.720 --> 23:04.940
but his story checks out,

23:05.010 --> 23:05.920
and detective sanchez says

23:05.980 --> 23:08.720
they have no record of his mercedes
at the airport either

23:09.910 --> 23:11.720
I should've just kept quiet and nodded.

23:13.620 --> 23:15.270
Anyway...

23:16.940 --> 23:21.140
it seems we've come rather a long way from
talking about my wife's car and chop shops

23:21.240 --> 23:22.600
Yes,we have.

23:23.390 --> 23:24.600
Yes.

23:26.330 --> 23:28.000
So,you haven't seen them

23:28.110 --> 23:29.860
since your wife took your daughter to japan?

23:31.370 --> 23:32.800
No.

23:36.810 --> 23:38.240
is this gonna take much longer,do you think?

23:38.300 --> 23:39.850
I ought to be getting back to work.

23:39.910 --> 23:41.560
And really,I mean,if you have an in

23:41.880 --> 23:42.790
with the british consulate,

23:42.850 --> 23:43.850
then that's great,

23:43.910 --> 23:46.740
but I feel like I've talked
about my family enough

23:48.640 --> 23:50.140
So if I told you

23:50.250 --> 23:51.670
that yumi and aiko

23:52.010 --> 23:55.110
came to los angeles from tokyo 20 days ago,

23:55.200 --> 23:57.040
you'd be very surprised.

24:01.170 --> 24:03.390
oh,my god.
This isn't about a car,is it?

24:07.930 --> 24:09.640
What are you playing then?

24:11.000 --> 24:13.480
Do you know something about
the whereabouts of my wife and daughter?

24:13.550 --> 24:15.980
So yumi and aiko didn't come
to your house from the airport?

24:16.080 --> 24:17.720
No. Where is my daughter?

24:17.790 --> 24:18.960
When was the last time you had--

24:19.020 --> 24:20.550
answer the bloody question,woman.

24:20.610 --> 24:22.320
Where is my daughter!

24:24.000 --> 24:26.270
-I'm sorry to inform you--
-no.

24:26.340 --> 24:27.230
Sir.

24:27.300 --> 24:28.770
-It is my duty to inform you...
-no.

24:28.830 --> 24:30.620
That your wife and daughter
were found tied together

24:30.660 --> 24:33.020
at the bottom of the los angeles harbor
this morning

24:33.090 --> 24:36.050
and it appears that they have
been dead for over two weeks

24:37.730 --> 24:39.650
I'm sorry,um...

24:39.880 --> 24:41.460
I'm trying to understand.

24:41.960 --> 24:43.150
I,uh...

24:44.150 --> 24:45.430
I don't think I believe you.

24:45.500 --> 24:47.460
Actually,what,you're saying that aiko'S...

24:49.370 --> 24:51.250
she'S...dead?

24:51.780 --> 24:53.850
I'm sorry,sir.
She is.

24:57.170 --> 24:58.280
It's a mistake.

24:59.770 --> 25:01.000
You made a mistake.

25:02.750 --> 25:03.820
It must be.

25:18.080 --> 25:19.490
That's my little girl.

25:24.790 --> 25:26.370
That's my little girl.

25:42.700 --> 25:45.390
Excuse me.

25:51.380 --> 25:52.720
Stay in here.

25:58.790 --> 26:01.220
Chief,we've come up dry everywhere else.

26:01.450 --> 26:04.270
Flynn found something out
at andrews' house that we...

26:04.500 --> 26:06.270
we thought you might like to see.

26:14.210 --> 26:15.240
Who is that?

26:16.640 --> 26:18.930
Meet andrews' new girlfriend and her son.

26:19.780 --> 26:21.630
They moved into his house two months ago.

26:29.560 --> 26:31.980
Hello.Keiko.

26:32.770 --> 26:35.750
I'm deputy chief brenda leigh johnson of the lapd.

26:40.980 --> 26:43.690
you're living with paul andrews now,is that right?

26:44.510 --> 26:45.720
Yes.

26:46.420 --> 26:49.000
How long ago did you two meet?

26:50.800 --> 26:52.360
almost 3 month.

26:52.950 --> 26:54.480
I meet him online.

26:54.870 --> 26:56.440
Paul very nice man.

26:56.570 --> 26:57.800
He take care of us.

26:58.410 --> 27:01.020
We not be able to do anything without him.

27:01.880 --> 27:04.100
Maybe I have to go back to japan.

27:05.680 --> 27:07.870
Did you know that paul was married?

27:09.580 --> 27:10.930
Yes.

27:11.810 --> 27:13.130
Yes.

27:13.360 --> 27:14.780
I'm married,too.

27:16.100 --> 27:17.580
My husband beat me.

27:18.700 --> 27:20.050
He beat my son.

27:21.130 --> 27:23.250
Paul's wife leave him.

27:23.770 --> 27:25.250
He not want to think it,

27:25.370 --> 27:27.580
but she could be seeing other man.

27:27.940 --> 27:29.420
Japanese man.

27:30.200 --> 27:31.870
Yumi not coming back.

27:32.070 --> 27:33.480
I read her letter.

27:35.240 --> 27:37.580
But yumi did come back.

27:40.090 --> 27:42.700
She came back about 3 weeks ago,

27:42.780 --> 27:46.150
and I'm thinking that she might have arranged
to be driven back to her house

27:46.310 --> 27:47.620
Are you home during the day?

27:49.270 --> 27:50.270
Yes.

27:51.290 --> 27:52.900
Unless I shop.

27:53.240 --> 27:57.150
And did yumi and aiko come back
to their house while you were there?

27:57.840 --> 27:58.980
No.

27:59.810 --> 28:01.110
They not come back.

28:02.630 --> 28:04.410
It my house now.

28:08.670 --> 28:09.910
Excuse me.

28:15.960 --> 28:17.100
Commander.

28:17.430 --> 28:20.220
I saw the background search
sergeant gabriel filed

28:20.390 --> 28:22.460
and I thought you might like to know

28:22.520 --> 28:25.730
that even though paul andrews
has no criminal record

28:26.350 --> 28:28.850
6 years ago,his first wife disappeared.

28:30.590 --> 28:32.920
One wife missing is a tragedy,but two.

28:33.090 --> 28:35.680
We worked it as a critical missing.

28:36.920 --> 28:38.440
I watched the interviews,chief,

28:38.520 --> 28:39.520
and I gotta say,

28:40.190 --> 28:41.330
he seemed genuine.

28:41.390 --> 28:43.280
And he had a rock-solid alibi.

28:44.400 --> 28:45.950
First wife's name is hosi?

28:45.980 --> 28:46.800
Right.

28:46.820 --> 28:48.980
And everyone said
how very much in  love they were

28:49.250 --> 28:50.690
And hosi was never found?

28:50.780 --> 28:53.110
No. And we looked for her,too.
Everywhere.

28:53.150 --> 28:54.890
Here,japan,mexico.

28:55.080 --> 28:56.230
Why mexico?

28:56.360 --> 28:59.420
We found her abandoned car
at the gloria arboretum

28:59.500 --> 29:01.030
Grounds keeper there had a rape record,

29:01.090 --> 29:04.080
and he lit out to guadalajara
before we could question him

29:04.210 --> 29:05.360
This rapist,

29:05.430 --> 29:07.320
he was an expert landscaper.

29:08.590 --> 29:10.990
He could've buried hosi anywhere

29:11.060 --> 29:12.940
between here and mexico

29:13.010 --> 29:15.460
unless that's her.

29:16.710 --> 29:18.830
Could almost be her twin sister.

29:19.580 --> 29:21.510
Well,I think if nothing else,

29:21.580 --> 29:23.510
it's fair to say paul andrews had a type.

29:23.970 --> 29:27.050
Or the girl he falls in love
with keeps rising from the dead

29:27.240 --> 29:29.320
Ok,thank you very much,commander.

29:29.380 --> 29:30.330
Sergeant gabriel,

29:30.410 --> 29:32.390
if you could keep an eye
on keiko for me,please

29:32.460 --> 29:34.090
and call detective sanchez

29:34.150 --> 29:35.330
and have him start dragging the short-term

29:35.410 --> 29:36.690
parking structure video

29:36.750 --> 29:38.960
near the terminal yumi and aiko flew into.

29:39.030 --> 29:40.520
-Thank you.
-Yes,ma'am.

29:42.110 --> 29:44.770
So,how did andrews take the news
about his wife and daughter?

29:45.020 --> 29:47.570
Terrible.He was stunned.

29:47.680 --> 29:49.830
So,are we absolutely certain it's him,

29:49.900 --> 29:51.750
or is there a possibility he's telling the truth?

29:53.460 --> 29:54.380
I don't know.

29:54.490 --> 29:56.260
I don't know.Excuse me.

30:12.250 --> 30:13.880
I should like to go home now,

30:13.950 --> 30:16.700
and I'll need a ride since you have my car.

30:17.740 --> 30:20.790
And I think an apology might be in order.

30:21.590 --> 30:22.850
I am sorry.

30:23.410 --> 30:25.650
And I understand
that your feelings are raw right now

30:25.740 --> 30:26.660
but the truth is--

30:26.690 --> 30:30.980
please,you have no idea how I feel.

30:31.780 --> 30:33.940
And do not presume
to talk to me about the truth

30:33.990 --> 30:36.660
since you brought me here
on entirely false pretenses

30:36.710 --> 30:37.860
-And have done nothing
-Mr. Andrews,

30:37.930 --> 30:40.230
-but lie to me--
-...discuss in a case like this.

30:40.290 --> 30:41.130
Mr. Andrews,

30:41.180 --> 30:43.800
I in insist you listen to me,
and right this second

30:43.880 --> 30:45.130
because we are trying to figure out

30:45.210 --> 30:47.480
how your second wife ended up
at the bottom of the harbor

30:47.540 --> 30:48.900
with your daughter tied to her waist,

30:48.970 --> 30:50.770
and it is your duty to help us.

30:51.950 --> 30:54.340
And then there is the matter of your girlfriend

30:54.640 --> 30:58.110
and her son who you moved into your house
after your wife disappeared

30:58.200 --> 31:00.120
My wife did not disappear.

31:00.280 --> 31:01.610
She went to japan.

31:01.710 --> 31:03.500
-I've been through this.
-I'm sorry. It's confusing.

31:03.550 --> 31:05.710
I'm getting your last wife
mixed up with your first

31:05.790 --> 31:07.720
who most definitely disappeared.

31:07.950 --> 31:11.530
Your second wife left you
and was recovered this morning dead

31:12.190 --> 31:14.370
And your girlfriend is in my office right now.

31:14.470 --> 31:15.480
That is the correct order,

31:15.540 --> 31:16.970
isn't it,mr. Andrews?

31:17.120 --> 31:20.500
It's hard to say because they look so much alike.

31:21.090 --> 31:24.250
Well,since you've decided to
make this day even worse than necessary

31:24.310 --> 31:26.010
which is apparently your purpose on earth,

31:26.060 --> 31:28.840
I'll see if I can explain things
to your satisfaction

31:29.010 --> 31:31.200
Yes,I have a girlfriend.

31:31.490 --> 31:33.740
After 3 months of searching for my wife

31:33.850 --> 31:35.780
I looked online for someone to spend time with.

31:35.880 --> 31:36.800
And keiko,

31:38.180 --> 31:39.980
who looks awfully like yumi,

31:41.330 --> 31:43.360
who looks awfully like hosi,

31:43.850 --> 31:47.040
who disappeared after our first year of marriage,

31:48.370 --> 31:50.960
and to make me go through this.

31:51.890 --> 31:53.860
This is the most painful period of my life,

31:53.930 --> 31:58.160
and it's not even an hour
after telling me my daughter is dead

31:58.240 --> 32:00.120
It is inhuman.

32:04.050 --> 32:05.900
Let's go through it quickly then.

32:14.310 --> 32:15.370
Very well.

32:19.630 --> 32:21.490
Until my daughter was born,

32:22.750 --> 32:25.300
I would say that hosi was the true...

32:26.190 --> 32:27.840
love of my life.

32:28.990 --> 32:30.390
More than that,I admired her.

32:30.460 --> 32:32.590
She was beautiful,and talented,and...

32:35.960 --> 32:37.540
if I am guilty of anything,

32:37.610 --> 32:41.290
it is of trying to recreate my first marriage
over and over again

32:41.380 --> 32:44.460
Choosing women because of
their physical resemblance to hosi

32:44.530 --> 32:46.700
and possibly that hasn't worked out for me,

32:46.780 --> 32:49.600
but to a degree,we are our patterns.

32:51.160 --> 32:52.830
I remember.Someone...

32:53.580 --> 32:55.550
I think it was my first latin master,

32:55.640 --> 32:59.190
he told me that if you were locked
in a library of the world's miseries

32:59.250 --> 33:02.070
you would be led almost inexorably
to choose your own

33:02.140 --> 33:04.310
because it's the pain you're familiar with.

33:06.900 --> 33:08.490
Still...

33:08.760 --> 33:11.480
isn't 3 months a little early
to start dating again?

33:11.550 --> 33:12.940
Oh,really.

33:13.090 --> 33:16.690
Well,I am dreadfully sorry that I didn't know you

33:16.760 --> 33:19.750
when I was sitting in my house
alone night after night drinking

33:19.840 --> 33:21.780
until the glass fell out of my hand.

33:21.870 --> 33:24.180
How long does the lapd
require someone to remain alone

33:24.290 --> 33:25.950
after they've been dumped and abandoned

33:26.020 --> 33:27.680
and had their family ripped apart?

33:27.880 --> 33:30.340
Have I violated some proscribed waiting period?

33:30.500 --> 33:32.920
Is it your intention to make me feel even worse

33:32.990 --> 33:35.280
about my daughter's death than I already do?

33:35.840 --> 33:38.510
You read my wife's letter,was it vague to you?

33:38.650 --> 33:39.670
She left me.

33:39.690 --> 33:40.520
What was i supposed to do,

33:40.550 --> 33:43.430
sit in my house for the rest of my life
waiting for the divorce papers?

33:43.520 --> 33:44.860
Are we sure it's him?

33:46.160 --> 33:47.430
I will say,

33:47.600 --> 33:49.870
she usually catches them
in a lie a lot sooner than this

33:49.950 --> 33:52.700
By all means,miss johnson,counsel me.

33:53.140 --> 33:54.790
What have i done wrong?

34:00.720 --> 34:02.370
Let's talk for a second about,um...

34:03.050 --> 34:04.120
this morning.

34:06.350 --> 34:08.719
Yumi and aiko were tied together

34:08.880 --> 34:12.210
in a manner indicating a form
of ritual japanese suicide

34:12.290 --> 34:14.030
known as oyaka-shinju.

34:14.310 --> 34:15.710
That's ridiculous.

34:16.210 --> 34:19.060
Yumi would never,never hurt our daughter.

34:19.150 --> 34:21.580
She lived for her.

34:21.659 --> 34:24.040
What if she found out that
you were living with another woman?

34:27.120 --> 34:28.449
She wouldn't have.

34:28.530 --> 34:29.440
What if she came back

34:29.510 --> 34:30.889
and saw keiko living in her house?

34:30.960 --> 34:32.300
She couldn't have.

34:32.760 --> 34:35.489
Keiko would've told me.
I'm certain.

34:38.010 --> 34:40.620
Did yumi have any connection
to the los angeles harbor?

34:41.190 --> 34:44.580
Yeah. We were married there at ports-of-call.

34:47.949 --> 34:51.909
Are you implying that she may
have killed herself there as A...

34:52.480 --> 34:54.080
a signal to me?

34:55.590 --> 34:57.960
This is the last of his boxe
from the storage unit.

34:59.020 --> 35:00.040
No luggage,huh?

35:00.120 --> 35:01.810
Uh-uh.No sleeping bags,

35:02.110 --> 35:04.750
no lamps,no furniture,no computer.

35:05.030 --> 35:07.550
This is paul and hosi's wedding album.

35:07.640 --> 35:09.050
Hosi,his first wife.

35:09.130 --> 35:11.500
They got married at the gloria arboretum.

35:11.880 --> 35:13.180
Pretty garden,isn't it?

35:13.780 --> 35:14.950
It's nice.

35:16.180 --> 35:18.590
Uh,we also unpacked some diving stuff.

35:18.660 --> 35:20.600
A wet suit and a face mask.

35:20.670 --> 35:22.070
But it's not really incriminating.

35:22.140 --> 35:23.280
Hey.

35:23.480 --> 35:25.260
Found something at the airport.

35:26.600 --> 35:27.780
So I'm looking at the tape.

35:27.890 --> 35:30.740
I see this guy in a service van
leaving the airport parking structure

35:30.870 --> 35:32.850
And he's got yumi and aiko with him.

35:34.470 --> 35:36.070
Shouldn't she know about this?

35:37.170 --> 35:40.640
Chief,detective sanchez found film
from the airport we need you to see

35:44.020 --> 35:45.210
Ok.

35:48.130 --> 35:49.920
I think it's time for us to take a break.

35:51.940 --> 35:53.600
Are you hungry or thirsty?

35:55.820 --> 35:57.760
Is there anything I can get you while I'm out?

36:04.050 --> 36:05.740
There's nothing you can do for me.

36:09.900 --> 36:10.970
Nothing.

36:14.910 --> 36:15.950
Ok.

36:17.080 --> 36:18.340
Back in a minute.

36:24.610 --> 36:25.890
Now here comes the van.

36:25.990 --> 36:27.040
You can't make out the driver,

36:27.130 --> 36:30.020
but that's yumi with aiko on her lap.

36:30.690 --> 36:32.350
I need this van,
and the guy who drives it,

36:32.420 --> 36:33.850
and I need him now!

36:34.330 --> 36:35.670
Flynn,gabriel.

36:46.710 --> 36:48.290
So,donny,is it.
Your name is donny?

36:48.360 --> 36:49.280
Yes,ma'am.

36:49.450 --> 36:50.510
You know why you're here?

36:50.580 --> 36:51.540
No. No idea.

36:51.620 --> 36:53.530
Really? Well,let me explain it to you then.

36:53.560 --> 36:55.730
-You're here because of cameras.
-Cameras?

36:55.800 --> 36:57.630
They're everywhere nowadays,did you know that?

36:57.700 --> 37:01.280
Since 9/11,taking pictures of people
leaving parking garages and stuff like that

37:01.960 --> 37:03.450
I'm gonna open the back of your van.

37:03.530 --> 37:04.700
-Is that ok?
-What do you want to do that for?

37:04.820 --> 37:06.220
Why,you got something in there
you don't want us to see?

37:06.300 --> 37:08.500
Stand over here and lose that attitude.

37:21.480 --> 37:23.060
Ok,ok,ok,uh...

37:23.660 --> 37:24.940
I hit another car,and I drove away.

37:25.030 --> 37:27.010
I fled the scene,but I didn't hurt anyone.

37:27.070 --> 37:28.430
Where's your other sleeping bag?

37:29.610 --> 37:31.670
You hear the lady,
where's your other sleeping bag?!

37:31.740 --> 37:33.310
How do you know I had another sleeping bag?

37:34.080 --> 37:36.200
It was stolen after I had the accident in the van.

37:37.020 --> 37:38.710
Look,can't I just say I'm sorry and pay?

37:41.250 --> 37:43.450
Cuff this bastard and read him his rights.

37:43.510 --> 37:44.700
Hey,hey,lady.Wait.

37:44.780 --> 37:46.540
-Shut up and listen!
-It was an accident!

37:46.580 --> 37:48.080
I'll pay for it.

37:48.360 --> 37:49.730
You have the right to remain silent.

37:49.830 --> 37:51.510
I did just as much damage to my van--

37:52.310 --> 37:53.820
wait a minute,wait a minute,wait a minute.

37:53.970 --> 37:54.930
You said you had an accident?

37:55.030 --> 37:56.650
Yes.
Yes,I scraped it pretty bad.

37:56.720 --> 37:58.110
I dented the rear and the side.

37:58.720 --> 38:00.070
Where's the damage to your van?

38:00.160 --> 38:01.820
I had it fixed.

38:02.590 --> 38:04.340
I never reported it to the insurance company.

38:04.480 --> 38:05.720
I paid cash.

38:07.530 --> 38:09.530
What's the name of the body shop you took it to?

38:13.360 --> 38:14.640
I think you have enough for an arrest.

38:14.720 --> 38:16.000
You have yumi's shoeS.

38:16.070 --> 38:17.880
Andrews had possession of the vehicle

38:17.940 --> 38:20.370
when his wife and daughter
were picked up at the airport

38:20.440 --> 38:22.490
The diving stuff connects him to the belt.

38:22.610 --> 38:25.340
He stole that sleeping bag from the van,

38:25.530 --> 38:28.600
and he dropped his wife and daughter off
in it over the edge of a pier

38:28.680 --> 38:30.970
The problem is I have no physical evidence.

38:31.340 --> 38:32.890
Nothing...at all.

38:33.570 --> 38:37.570
Plus any decent defense attorney can
provide a credible alternative suspect

38:37.630 --> 38:38.940
thanks to our good friend donny.

38:39.030 --> 38:39.960
It was his van,

38:40.050 --> 38:41.240
he has the sleeping bags.

38:41.330 --> 38:43.280
There's no way to establish the time of death.

38:43.310 --> 38:45.180
We were hoping we would find something in all this

38:45.230 --> 38:46.490
that would tie him to the murder,

38:46.560 --> 38:48.200
but it's all just stuff.

38:48.280 --> 38:49.360
Stop,stop.

38:49.970 --> 38:51.010
Stop.

38:51.090 --> 38:52.240
Stop,stop.

38:52.280 --> 38:54.310
Opening those boxes.Stop.

38:54.400 --> 38:55.960
Why?

38:57.500 --> 38:59.270
These boxes prove he did it.

39:00.280 --> 39:01.820
Do you know what's in them?

39:01.880 --> 39:02.930
I don't need to know.

39:04.350 --> 39:06.130
Take those three unopened boxes

39:06.200 --> 39:08.750
and meet me outside the interview room.Thank you.

39:17.450 --> 39:18.600
I've had enough.

39:18.770 --> 39:20.670
Really,I'm exhausted and sick to my stomach,

39:20.740 --> 39:22.180
and I need to go home.

39:22.270 --> 39:23.510
Please have a seat,sir.

39:23.570 --> 39:24.770
We have just one more thing to deal with.

39:24.840 --> 39:26.010
I'm sorry,really.

39:26.050 --> 39:27.350
I'm all played out for the day.

39:27.420 --> 39:29.640
I have friends and relatives I need to call,

39:29.720 --> 39:31.390
and I should like to see the bodies

39:31.890 --> 39:33.260
if that can be arranged.

39:33.340 --> 39:34.890
We'll get to that in a minute.

39:35.540 --> 39:37.060
Do you know what these are,sir?

39:38.400 --> 39:41.620
Yes. You have no right to
be going through my personal life

39:41.690 --> 39:42.510
As a matter of fact,

39:42.590 --> 39:44.110
I have every right to
go through your personal life

39:44.180 --> 39:45.280
but I have to tell you,sir,

39:45.370 --> 39:47.190
it is not a place I'd like to linger.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.780
How am I supposed to know these boxes are yours?

39:50.850 --> 39:53.010
Well,you got them
from my storage facility.Obviously

39:53.090 --> 39:54.340
That only proves that you possessed them.

39:54.420 --> 39:56.000
How can I be sure that you're the proper owner?

39:56.080 --> 39:57.830
Well,for one thing I can tell you what's in them.

39:57.890 --> 39:59.320
See this one,cc.

39:59.390 --> 40:01.400
China cups wrapped in old newspapers.

40:01.480 --> 40:04.420
So be careful with it
if you don't mind,and in this one

40:04.500 --> 40:06.890
old video games from the mid '90s. Vg.

40:06.980 --> 40:09.650
So if I opened up this box
and didn't find china cups

40:09.730 --> 40:11.220
-you'd be very surprised?
-I would.

40:11.300 --> 40:12.890
-Why is that?
-Because i packed them myself.

40:12.970 --> 40:14.510
-I don't believe you.
-Well,it's the truth.

40:14.580 --> 40:16.370
-You swear to it?
-On my life.

40:16.510 --> 40:18.890
You know what's interesting
about that,mr. Andrews?

40:19.000 --> 40:21.590
Is that when you packed up
these boxes,you used nylon cord

40:21.830 --> 40:24.370
made with surgeon's knots.

40:24.770 --> 40:26.910
And it's the exact same type of cord,

40:27.100 --> 40:30.500
and the exact same kind of knots
that you used to tie the body

40:30.800 --> 40:32.670
of your wife to that of your daughter

40:32.730 --> 40:35.930
before strapping on a diving belt
and dumping them into the ocean

40:37.910 --> 40:41.610
I found film of your wife and daughter
being picked up from the airport

40:42.120 --> 40:44.710
Ok,now he looks like a liar.

40:44.780 --> 40:48.150
They were sitting in the front seat of a van
that was supposedly in your body shop

40:48.210 --> 40:50.320
the night that yumi and aiko arrived from japan.

40:51.640 --> 40:53.510
And you know what,mr. Andrews,

40:54.060 --> 40:57.720
I'm starting to get a really good picture
of you with a needle in your arm

40:58.280 --> 41:02.050
So now comes the time
when we stop lying to each other

41:02.110 --> 41:04.510
and start telling each other the absolute truth.

41:04.950 --> 41:07.290
I can either arrest you for first degree murder

41:07.380 --> 41:09.100
with the special circumstance of lying in wait,

41:09.220 --> 41:10.940
which carries with it the death penalty,

41:11.040 --> 41:12.710
or I can bring the D.A. In here,

41:12.930 --> 41:14.330
and you can confess.

41:14.930 --> 41:16.440
Maybe even save your life.

41:17.140 --> 41:19.710
Which is a chance
your wife and daughter never had

41:21.190 --> 41:22.630
All I want to know...

41:23.630 --> 41:24.910
really...

41:25.750 --> 41:27.290
is why?

41:28.600 --> 41:30.950
Did you kill yumi and aiko

41:31.050 --> 41:32.670
because you had a new girlfriend,

41:32.890 --> 41:36.020
or was it to save your house
and your business?Is that it?

41:36.090 --> 41:39.210
Did you murder your child
to avoid splitting up your assets?

41:45.640 --> 41:49.030
Do I really seem like such a monster to you?

41:52.240 --> 41:54.180
You look human enough.

41:57.280 --> 41:59.790
Are you gonna tell me
why you killed your wife and daughter?

42:04.990 --> 42:06.650
I have nothing to explain,

42:06.730 --> 42:08.290
and even if I did,

42:08.910 --> 42:10.910
you wouldn't understand.

42:11.610 --> 42:13.300
What about your first wife hosi?

42:13.390 --> 42:14.420
What happened to her?

42:20.340 --> 42:21.790
I never...

42:23.370 --> 42:24.900
laid a hand upon her.

42:24.980 --> 42:28.060
I never touched her except to love her.

42:28.600 --> 42:29.690
I'd never...

42:30.020 --> 42:32.580
hurt...hosi. Never.

42:35.920 --> 42:37.240
All right,then.

42:38.390 --> 42:40.320
I'll just stick with what I can prove.

42:40.870 --> 42:42.940
You smart enough to make a deal with the D.A.?

42:43.020 --> 42:44.700
Or should I arrest you for murder one?

42:51.910 --> 42:54.850
He admitted to poisoning his wife
and child with cyanide.

42:57.030 --> 42:58.460
Putting them in a sleeping bag,

42:58.550 --> 43:00.680
tying them up to make it
look like a ritual suicide,

43:00.800 --> 43:02.070
and dumping them in the ocean.

43:02.180 --> 43:03.370
And this deputy D.A.,

43:03.540 --> 43:04.860
And I told him,I said,

43:05.170 --> 43:07.780
paul andrews is a pathological liar.

43:08.480 --> 43:09.800
So what does he do?

43:10.040 --> 43:11.720
In exchange for a confession?

43:12.350 --> 43:14.120
Two terms of first-degree murder.

43:14.200 --> 43:16.470
But concurrent.Not consecutive.

43:17.230 --> 43:19.210
Paul andrews is gonna get parole one day.

43:19.290 --> 43:21.100
-I know it.
-There's a way around that.

43:22.260 --> 43:24.150
-How?
-Bring him to trial.

43:24.340 --> 43:25.810
I can't do that.

43:25.870 --> 43:27.580
He's already made a deal with the D.A.

43:27.650 --> 43:29.500
Plus it's only so much we can do to him

43:29.650 --> 43:31.890
because the japanese helped us
with their dental records.

43:33.300 --> 43:36.310
Japanese helped you with the bodies
you found in the harbor.

43:37.040 --> 43:39.000
What about the first wife?

43:39.230 --> 43:41.260
The one he married at the gloria arboretum?

43:44.000 --> 43:46.150
He said we're all creatures of patterns.

43:46.210 --> 43:48.090
Buried his second wife where he married her.

43:49.230 --> 43:50.830
What about the first wife?

43:51.305 --> 43:57.265
