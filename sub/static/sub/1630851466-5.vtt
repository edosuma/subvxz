00:13.345 --> 01:18.545
Previously...

01:19.469 --> 01:20.909
(Episode 5)

01:28.579 --> 01:29.779
What is it?

01:29.780 --> 01:32.719
Hello? It's me, Choi Sang Kyun.

01:33.050 --> 01:36.159
I'm calling you in secret,
so I'll get straight to it.

01:36.519 --> 01:39.329
My dad always told me to hold onto
my final card until the end.

01:39.330 --> 01:41.130
That's why I thought about it
for a long time.

01:41.760 --> 01:42.929
To be honest,

01:43.859 --> 01:47.370
my dad said he found that person
on the messenger.

01:48.569 --> 01:51.500
The last person to get contacted
during the emergency in Dandong.

01:52.709 --> 01:54.110
That person's name is...

01:55.540 --> 01:56.640
Seo...

01:59.949 --> 02:01.150
Su Yeon.

02:02.349 --> 02:03.680
That's what it said.

02:16.559 --> 02:17.559
What's wrong?

02:24.500 --> 02:25.569
Are you all right?

02:26.670 --> 02:27.670
Ji Hyuk.

02:28.110 --> 02:29.580
Han Ji Hyuk.

02:32.480 --> 02:33.849
What do you think you're doing?

02:36.319 --> 02:37.649
You know who Lee Choon Gil is.

02:38.590 --> 02:40.090
What are you saying out of the blue?

02:40.720 --> 02:42.819
- Who gave you the order?
- Let me go.

02:43.659 --> 02:46.390
I'm asking you.
Who gave you the order? Tell me.

02:46.629 --> 02:48.899
- Have you gone insane?
- Say it.

02:49.129 --> 02:51.970
You're out of your mind. Get a grip.

02:52.670 --> 02:54.069
Who gave you the order?

02:54.330 --> 02:55.440
Say it!

02:56.099 --> 02:57.898
- Ji Hyuk.
- Who gave you the order?

02:57.899 --> 02:59.039
Ji Hyuk!

03:38.580 --> 03:39.779
You're up.

03:40.410 --> 03:41.850
How did I get here?

03:42.019 --> 03:43.920
On our staff's back.

03:44.119 --> 03:46.350
You collapsed in Chief Seo's office.

03:47.450 --> 03:48.760
Do you not remember?

03:59.100 --> 04:00.529
What happened to Su Yeon?

04:01.100 --> 04:03.170
She was bruised severely
on her neck and arms.

04:03.540 --> 04:04.569
Is that all?

04:04.570 --> 04:07.010
This is workplace violence.

04:07.140 --> 04:09.480
On top of that,
you attacked your superior.

04:09.910 --> 04:12.148
Chief Seo said she'd let it go,
but this is...

04:12.149 --> 04:14.309
I don't care,
so go ahead and file the report.

04:14.550 --> 04:16.980
Did you look in a mirror?
Look at your face.

04:17.380 --> 04:20.290
You can't remember a thing
even after you did what you did.

04:20.749 --> 04:22.219
You can't go on like this.

04:22.660 --> 04:24.489
I'll catch up on this later.

04:25.019 --> 04:27.760
And I need a prescription.

04:28.830 --> 04:30.830
You can't go on like this.

04:31.029 --> 04:33.268
I can't give you a prescription...

04:33.269 --> 04:35.029
until you receive proper treatment.

04:35.640 --> 04:37.100
So be it, then.

04:37.269 --> 04:38.610
Know this.

04:39.670 --> 04:41.739
Your symptoms
always became severer...

04:42.279 --> 04:43.910
around that time of the year.

04:56.459 --> 04:59.989
I received a report of your behavior
at Su Yeon's office.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.558
Go on and make an excuse.

05:03.559 --> 05:06.099
I apologize.
I have no excuses to make.

05:06.100 --> 05:07.130
Is that so?

05:08.570 --> 05:10.939
Then I'll also cut to the chase.

05:11.140 --> 05:13.738
Go somewhere quiet
and cool down for a few months.

05:13.739 --> 05:16.010
This won't happen again.

05:16.309 --> 05:18.439
Please don't make me take time off.

05:18.950 --> 05:21.109
I think I already gave you
enough chances.

05:21.110 --> 05:22.880
And this is what it came down to.

05:23.249 --> 05:24.979
I can't just let this go.

05:24.980 --> 05:26.648
I know you two
used to work in the same team,

05:26.649 --> 05:27.988
but she's now your superior.

05:27.989 --> 05:30.119
And you attacked
your superior at the workplace.

05:32.429 --> 05:34.689
Did Chief Seo
raise a problem with me?

05:35.259 --> 05:36.259
What?

05:36.260 --> 05:39.770
Did Chief Seo Su Yeon herself
raise a problem with me?

05:39.800 --> 05:41.100
You punk.

05:42.540 --> 05:44.439
Don't you get it?

05:45.239 --> 05:47.470
You've already gone
way beyond your limit.

05:47.670 --> 05:50.309
You're a ticking bomb
that can blow up any moment.

05:52.879 --> 05:55.919
I won't let any of my staff
get hurt anymore.

05:55.920 --> 05:58.449
I'm not looking to stop here.

05:59.989 --> 06:01.090
Fine.

06:02.559 --> 06:05.290
If you can't accept my offer,
I can't help it.

06:05.689 --> 06:08.360
I'll have to convene
a disciplinary committee.

06:11.100 --> 06:12.499
This is quite confusing.

06:17.040 --> 06:19.170
What I find tough to accept is...

06:19.840 --> 06:22.910
how sensitive
you react to this right now.

06:26.650 --> 06:27.879
You may leave.

06:31.480 --> 06:34.119
As of this moment,
your punishment is...

06:34.650 --> 06:36.090
no longer at my disposal.

07:00.910 --> 07:02.079
Are you all right?

07:03.249 --> 07:05.520
I was on my way
to see you right now.

07:07.119 --> 07:08.819
I was a bit flustered back there...

07:09.189 --> 07:10.660
when you suddenly did that.

07:13.329 --> 07:14.530
It's apparently...

07:15.730 --> 07:17.329
some kind of aftereffect, right?

07:18.230 --> 07:20.328
Dr. Kim said it wasn't a big deal,

07:20.329 --> 07:21.869
so I was a little relieved.

07:22.369 --> 07:25.040
Are you sure you're okay?

07:28.439 --> 07:30.179
Yes, I'm fine.

07:30.939 --> 07:32.780
I'm sorry. Let me apologize.

07:34.110 --> 07:36.949
It's all right.
You don't have to mind it.

07:37.780 --> 07:40.090
No, not that. About what I said.

07:40.489 --> 07:41.818
What are you talking about?

07:41.819 --> 07:43.059
The way...

07:43.559 --> 07:45.929
I accused you back there.

07:48.290 --> 07:50.360
You pushed me against the wall,

07:50.960 --> 07:52.099
then collapsed.

07:52.100 --> 07:53.499
What do you think you said to me?

07:55.199 --> 07:56.840
You know who Lee Choon Gil is.

07:57.369 --> 07:59.910
Who gave you the order?

08:01.770 --> 08:03.840
You must've wanted to say something.

08:04.309 --> 08:06.079
If you came to apologize,

08:06.610 --> 08:08.378
I'm sure it wasn't anything good.

08:08.379 --> 08:09.449
No.

08:10.520 --> 08:12.090
I was going to ask you a question.

08:12.489 --> 08:13.550
What is it?

08:16.689 --> 08:18.119
(Deputy Commissioner Lee In Hwan)

08:23.230 --> 08:25.770
- Go ahead.
- It's nothing.

08:26.999 --> 08:28.600
There's no need now.

08:29.639 --> 08:31.439
You found an answer
to your question already?

08:32.938 --> 08:34.009
Something else...

08:35.110 --> 08:36.539
intrigues me more now.

08:37.879 --> 08:38.980
You haven't changed.

08:39.679 --> 08:40.919
You still do whatever you want.

08:42.679 --> 08:44.749
You should answer that.
It must be an urgent call.

09:17.579 --> 09:19.619
I called the number...

09:20.220 --> 09:21.749
you gave me.

09:22.889 --> 09:26.689
But a group of other people
showed up...

09:27.259 --> 09:29.100
at the rendezvous point.

09:30.600 --> 09:31.660
They had come...

09:32.429 --> 09:33.600
to kill me.

09:49.449 --> 09:51.779
("Gangsters Raid
the Police Station at Night")

09:51.780 --> 09:55.150
("Will Korea Become
the Manufacturer of Narcotics?")

10:03.099 --> 10:04.630
Where's Hwang Mo Sool?

10:07.770 --> 10:09.300
(Mugshot of Jang Gwang Cheol)

10:11.199 --> 10:13.319
(Operation to Arrest
Jang Gwang Cheol of Huayang Gang)

10:24.819 --> 10:26.020
I can't do it.

10:27.250 --> 10:28.689
Besides,

10:29.359 --> 10:30.920
my cousin isn't a spy.

10:31.290 --> 10:33.359
This is what you testified.

10:33.829 --> 10:35.228
Why can't you sign it?

10:35.229 --> 10:38.429
I was coerced
to make this statement.

10:38.699 --> 10:40.370
Since I was coerced,

10:41.370 --> 10:42.800
I cannot sign this.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.099
Didn't I tell you?

10:45.709 --> 10:48.880
This isn't the only piece
of evidence we have.

10:49.809 --> 10:52.139
Your cousin won't be able
to get acquitted of the charge.

10:52.140 --> 10:53.280
(Testifier: Jung Eun Hee)

10:53.380 --> 10:54.449
Goodness.

10:55.920 --> 10:58.318
I'm sure you've heard of her.

10:58.319 --> 10:59.819
Reporter Jung Ki Sun.

11:00.349 --> 11:03.089
She deserted North Korea with her husband,
a high-ranking official.

11:03.359 --> 11:05.318
With her experience of working
as a reporter in Pyongyang,

11:05.319 --> 11:06.959
she joined Daekook Ilbo.

11:07.490 --> 11:09.358
She was the first defector
to join the company.

11:09.359 --> 11:11.729
So it was quite the talk
of the town.

11:11.959 --> 11:13.770
I remember reading her article.

11:14.429 --> 11:15.769
But what was the charge?

11:15.770 --> 11:17.338
She used her status as a reporter.

11:17.339 --> 11:20.339
And she visited North Korea
several times through China.

11:20.809 --> 11:22.909
And she was suspected of handing
over personal information...

11:22.910 --> 11:24.708
of millions
of North Korean defectors...

11:24.709 --> 11:26.509
to a member
of the Ministry of State Security.

11:27.179 --> 11:29.449
And we're interrogating her now.

11:29.719 --> 11:32.218
Of course, she denied
all the charges against her.

11:32.219 --> 11:34.349
And she's pleading the Fifth.

11:35.760 --> 11:37.840
Our agency must have worked
on this case for a while.

11:37.959 --> 11:40.929
We seem to have gathered
quite a lot of evidence.

11:41.229 --> 11:43.959
We even have a statement
from her cousin.

11:44.729 --> 11:46.000
Her cousin?

11:46.429 --> 11:48.769
She fled North Korea
and arrived here a few months ago.

11:48.770 --> 11:50.598
While being questioned
at the joint interrogation center,

11:50.599 --> 11:53.146
she made a statement that proved
the suspicion against Jung Ki Sun.

11:53.170 --> 11:55.678
Are you sure I can trust you?

11:55.679 --> 11:59.079
I'll do my best to get you out
as soon as you sign this.

11:59.380 --> 12:00.750
You're diabetic too.

12:01.349 --> 12:03.179
You should get out of here
and get treated.

12:03.719 --> 12:05.579
She'll just spend
a few months in jail.

12:05.990 --> 12:08.290
After that, you and your cousin
can live together.

12:09.620 --> 12:12.189
I don't have much of a choice
as I took over at the last minute.

12:13.059 --> 12:15.899
Director Baek Sang Chul was leading
this project.

12:15.900 --> 12:19.099
But due to a personal reason,
the case was handed over to me.

12:20.370 --> 12:23.169
I know it's a lot to ask,
but please check...

12:23.170 --> 12:25.376
if the evidence we have here
doesn't contradict each other.

12:25.400 --> 12:27.540
Please have a thorough look at them.

12:28.309 --> 12:29.809
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am

12:35.349 --> 12:37.880
And that brings me to my next point.

12:38.380 --> 12:40.490
It's about Director Baek's project.

12:42.150 --> 12:44.120
Why did you hand it over
to Chief Seo again?

12:45.490 --> 12:47.289
You also let her handle
Director Choi's case.

12:47.290 --> 12:49.090
This has been the topic
of our junior members.

12:50.660 --> 12:51.900
Please tell me.

12:52.229 --> 12:54.199
Why are you favoring her
over others?

12:58.199 --> 12:59.209
I'm sorry.

12:59.770 --> 13:01.568
I overstepped.

13:01.569 --> 13:03.010
I can understand that.

13:04.510 --> 13:06.050
It's only natural.

13:07.280 --> 13:08.479
But you see...

13:09.349 --> 13:12.079
Do you know what the surest way
is to make someone...

13:13.650 --> 13:14.719
one of your own?

13:20.890 --> 13:22.089
By putting the same blood...

13:25.500 --> 13:26.900
on their hands.

13:30.199 --> 13:31.199
Drink up.

13:38.140 --> 13:39.809
Gosh. I'm so stressed out.

13:42.150 --> 13:44.620
Je Yi, how is it going?

13:44.750 --> 13:46.848
It's just work, you know.

13:46.849 --> 13:49.920
Gosh. Your skin looks so dry.

13:50.260 --> 13:52.059
Try this. Okay?

13:56.900 --> 13:57.929
Right here.

14:00.670 --> 14:01.670
And on your lips too.

14:02.300 --> 14:03.300
Lips.

14:03.301 --> 14:05.500
- And on your neck.
- Okay. My neck.

14:06.209 --> 14:08.708
Gosh. Doesn't it feel so moist?

14:08.709 --> 14:09.780
Yes.

14:10.809 --> 14:12.510
Je Yi, you know what?

14:13.910 --> 14:16.449
I don't understand this.

14:17.219 --> 14:18.949
Can you help me?

14:25.089 --> 14:26.660
- Min Chul.
- Yes?

14:27.030 --> 14:28.490
It's about Jung Ki Sun.

14:29.059 --> 14:32.698
Our agency couldn't wait to nail her.

14:32.699 --> 14:33.870
Why?

14:34.170 --> 14:37.400
She painted us
in a bad light multiple times.

14:37.770 --> 14:39.838
Of course, she did.

14:39.839 --> 14:42.779
When North Korea had
the currency reform before,

14:42.780 --> 14:44.338
she ran the scoop before anyone.

14:44.339 --> 14:47.348
So the higher-ups were summoned
by the National Assembly.

14:47.349 --> 14:48.948
It was such a hassle for them.

14:48.949 --> 14:49.949
And...

14:50.579 --> 14:52.589
of all charges,
it's the espionage charge.

14:52.949 --> 14:54.390
Did you hear anything?

14:54.620 --> 14:57.119
Don't you know that
I'm the last guy...

14:57.120 --> 15:00.088
to find out anything at our agency?

15:00.089 --> 15:02.229
- Right. I agree.
- Exactly.

15:02.290 --> 15:03.558
Gosh.

15:03.559 --> 15:05.129
They've been pushing out
all these competent agents.

15:05.130 --> 15:08.000
Isn't it obvious that they are
trying to help only Chief Seo?

15:09.300 --> 15:10.540
(Employee Personal Information)

15:10.969 --> 15:13.240
We should stop meeting like this
for the time being.

15:13.410 --> 15:15.209
Why? Is there something wrong?

15:15.410 --> 15:18.739
Everyone is kind of on edge
because of the recent hacking job.

15:18.740 --> 15:21.050
And Internal Affairs
seems to be watching people too.

15:21.349 --> 15:22.978
I'm not sure
if this is the right thing.

15:22.979 --> 15:26.049
She used to be on your team before.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.150
(Suspension: 3 months)

15:27.420 --> 15:29.458
Su Yeon was suspended?

15:29.459 --> 15:31.359
You can't judge a book by its cover.

15:31.790 --> 15:34.589
Su Yeon was very disgruntled
about our agency.

15:34.829 --> 15:37.098
Whenever they started new projects,
she kept sending in reports...

15:37.099 --> 15:38.399
that explained the risks.

15:38.400 --> 15:40.170
So she had to face
disciplinary action too.

15:41.370 --> 15:43.370
And what's this?

15:44.069 --> 15:45.098
(High risk, in need of
therapy and treatment)

15:45.099 --> 15:46.968
Oh, that. A few years ago,

15:46.969 --> 15:49.609
she was categorized as a high-risk agent
from the psych evaluation.

15:49.640 --> 15:51.560
So she went through
several thorough evaluations.

15:51.979 --> 15:53.478
How come there's no record
of her seeing a doctor?

15:53.479 --> 15:55.780
Yes. That is a bit odd.

15:56.479 --> 15:58.149
Other than seeing our agency's
therapist a few times,

15:58.150 --> 15:59.920
she didn't see other shrinks.

16:01.819 --> 16:05.019
The more I check her out,
the more she reminds me of someone.

16:05.020 --> 16:06.688
What do you mean? Who?

16:06.689 --> 16:08.229
She reminds me of you.

16:13.300 --> 16:16.439

Gangnam-gu, Seoul)

17:39.689 --> 17:41.250

17:45.390 --> 17:47.789
Other than seeing our agency's
therapist a few times,

17:47.790 --> 17:49.529
she didn't see other shrinks.

19:41.369 --> 19:45.139
(Deputy Commissioner Lee In Hwan)

19:46.349 --> 19:47.710
Yes, sir.

19:48.849 --> 19:51.480
No, I'm on my way.

19:52.619 --> 19:55.299
Yes, I completed the first draft
of the press release you requested.

19:55.349 --> 19:57.520
I'll send it to you
as soon as I get in.

19:58.619 --> 19:59.690
Yes.

20:00.760 --> 20:02.559
That will be ready sometime
next week.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.200
I will check on it.

20:23.379 --> 20:25.379
This was way before
Kyung Seok joined the team.

20:26.720 --> 20:28.149
That means...

20:39.599 --> 20:40.970
I was wondering what you wanted.

20:41.599 --> 20:43.569
Did you want to meet me
to ask me that?

20:44.839 --> 20:46.809
Why do you want to know
all of a sudden?

20:49.440 --> 20:50.838
Right, well...

20:50.839 --> 20:53.510
Su Yeon was seeing someone.

20:54.480 --> 20:55.950
When was it again?

20:56.220 --> 20:58.379
I think it was four years ago.

20:59.950 --> 21:01.520
How are you so sure?

21:07.790 --> 21:10.359
Do you think I sit around
and do nothing?

21:10.530 --> 21:13.168
Try being in my position.
You see things even if you don't want to.

21:13.169 --> 21:15.568
How you work, what you're thinking,
when you answer the phone,

21:15.569 --> 21:17.039
and even when you go
to the bathroom.

21:17.040 --> 21:19.369
Even if I do nothing,
I can see all of it.

21:20.409 --> 21:22.369
I'm sure she was dating someone
inside the agency.

21:23.639 --> 21:24.739
Why?

21:24.740 --> 21:26.579
I just have a feeling.

21:26.649 --> 21:29.949
Plus, who would date someone
as irritable as her?

21:29.950 --> 21:31.449
Only someone who works
in the same field can.

21:31.450 --> 21:33.289
Are you sure it was four years ago?

21:33.290 --> 21:34.419
Yes, I am.

21:34.550 --> 21:37.819
It was around the time my daughter
started getting treated.

21:40.290 --> 21:42.760
I heard you caused a scene
in Su Yeon's office recently.

21:43.300 --> 21:45.960
Is this related to that?

21:47.399 --> 21:50.139
No, sir. Thank you for informing me.

21:58.180 --> 22:00.279
She was using drugs
without a prescription.

22:00.280 --> 22:02.209
If you look into the people
around her,

22:02.210 --> 22:04.426
you'll find someone who works in
medicine or pharmaceuticals.

22:04.450 --> 22:06.290
But why are you looking
into Chief Seo?

22:08.050 --> 22:09.490
Can you do it?

22:09.690 --> 22:11.589
You can do this on your own.

22:11.859 --> 22:14.358
I'm blocked from accessing
our internal database.

22:14.359 --> 22:15.530
On top of that,

22:15.990 --> 22:18.230
there are a lot
of people watching me.

22:18.430 --> 22:19.500
Then...

22:20.270 --> 22:23.000
that means you need
my help right now.

22:23.540 --> 22:24.569
What?

22:27.309 --> 22:28.639
How about we do this?

22:29.470 --> 22:32.510
We will share everything we find out
about Chief Seo...

22:32.680 --> 22:33.879
with one another.

22:36.780 --> 22:38.779
I'm in charge of a new project,

22:38.780 --> 22:41.020
and it's connected to Chief Seo.

22:42.889 --> 22:45.319
Okay. I understand. Let's do that.

22:46.290 --> 22:47.329
Yes, sir.

22:47.690 --> 22:51.760
If you don't have anything else to say,
I'll get going.

22:52.399 --> 22:53.869
It's way past lunch.

22:54.200 --> 22:56.740
And I'm curious about something.

22:58.040 --> 23:00.040
Let's say you're dating someone.

23:00.669 --> 23:01.710
Pardon?

23:01.839 --> 23:05.040
No, let's pretend that you are.

23:05.240 --> 23:07.908
If you're dating someone,

23:07.909 --> 23:12.180
do you think you could take him
to a place where you made memories...

23:12.750 --> 23:13.849
with an ex-boyfriend?

23:14.649 --> 23:16.219
Why do you want to know?

23:16.220 --> 23:18.889
I just want to know how women think.

23:20.460 --> 23:21.659
I'm not sure.

23:22.889 --> 23:25.329
If I'm serious about the man
I'm seeing right now,

23:25.399 --> 23:27.069
I don't think I would do that.

23:28.200 --> 23:31.040
Wouldn't you do something like that
if you were still hung up on the ex?

23:32.599 --> 23:35.270
Is this about you?

23:43.180 --> 23:45.179
I said we should go out to eat.

23:45.180 --> 23:47.189
You're too much. You know that?

23:47.190 --> 23:49.648
Thank you. I'll enjoy this.

23:49.649 --> 23:51.089
Did you find anything?

23:51.220 --> 23:52.290
Yes.

23:52.790 --> 23:55.059
About Reporter Jung Ki Sun's cousin.

23:55.329 --> 23:57.499
The statement she gave
at the joint interrogation center...

23:57.500 --> 24:00.128
and the exit and entry records
don't match up.

24:00.129 --> 24:01.499
What? What's different?

24:01.500 --> 24:03.638
According to the exit and entry
records we got from China,

24:03.639 --> 24:05.999
it says that the last time
Jung Ki Sun went into North Korea...

24:06.000 --> 24:07.539
was on the 24th.

24:07.540 --> 24:10.440
But in her cousin's statement,
it says it was on the 14th.

24:10.909 --> 24:13.009
Wait. Hold on.

24:13.010 --> 24:15.348
They testified about something
that didn't happen?

24:15.349 --> 24:18.148
Gosh, I'm sure
she was just confused.

24:18.149 --> 24:20.919
But still.
This is an important matter.

24:22.089 --> 24:25.219
Is there any way I can meet
Reporter Jung directly?

24:25.220 --> 24:27.529
I was curious about something,

24:27.530 --> 24:29.929
so I contacted that department
and asked for a visit.

24:29.930 --> 24:32.358
But they got incredibly mad.

24:32.359 --> 24:35.530
They must think they caught
Bin Laden or something.

24:35.629 --> 24:36.839
My gosh.

24:38.369 --> 24:42.838
Why don't you try meeting
her cousin instead?

24:42.839 --> 24:44.479
She's the one who testified.

24:44.480 --> 24:46.308
Isn't she at
the joint interrogation center?

24:46.309 --> 24:48.949
They finished the investigation,
so she was sent home.

24:48.950 --> 24:51.119
They already let her go? Why?

24:51.220 --> 24:52.519
That's how they are.

24:52.520 --> 24:55.118
That's how they do things over
at the North Korea Department.

24:55.119 --> 24:56.190
They're terrible.

24:59.290 --> 25:00.389
(Seo Psychiatric Clinic)

25:02.690 --> 25:04.499
Sir, I looked into it,

25:04.500 --> 25:08.069
and one of Chief Seo's cousins
is a psychiatrist with her own clinic.

25:08.530 --> 25:10.569
I'll send you the location of the clinic.

25:12.639 --> 25:13.669
Come in.

25:22.050 --> 25:24.780
- What brings you here?
- Do you know Ms. Seo Su Yeon?

25:28.490 --> 25:29.689
Who are you?

25:29.690 --> 25:31.559
I work in the same company as her.

25:35.290 --> 25:36.389
You're right.

25:37.059 --> 25:39.530
It's been a few years since
she's been getting treated by me.

25:39.970 --> 25:42.628
She has depression and insomnia,

25:42.629 --> 25:45.300
but she said she couldn't leave
any records of treatment.

25:45.800 --> 25:46.809
Why is that?

25:47.809 --> 25:49.638
She said that if
your company found out,

25:49.639 --> 25:51.479
she might not be able
to work anymore.

25:51.480 --> 25:54.879
No. I'm asking how Su Yeon ended up
like that.

25:56.210 --> 25:57.720
Because of your company.

25:58.480 --> 26:01.250
That place ruined Su Yeon.

26:02.990 --> 26:04.989
I should've stopped her
when she said...

26:04.990 --> 26:07.190
she wanted to go there to work under
some director.

26:08.089 --> 26:09.460
Su Yeon...

26:09.960 --> 26:12.200
may look cold on the outside,

26:12.329 --> 26:14.300
but she's emotional and sensitive.

26:14.629 --> 26:16.429
And she's incredibly sympathetic...

26:16.430 --> 26:18.440
towards other people.

26:18.800 --> 26:19.970
Perhaps that's why...

26:20.240 --> 26:22.839
she struggled to deal with
the events that happened there.

26:23.010 --> 26:25.138
Which event are you talking about?

26:25.139 --> 26:26.510
You know what I'm talking about.

26:27.280 --> 26:29.980
The terrible things that happened
to her colleagues.

26:30.750 --> 26:32.418
She had a lot of hostility towards
the agency...

26:32.419 --> 26:34.499
for forcing people to sacrifice
themselves like that.

26:34.589 --> 26:36.559
As events like that kept repeating,

26:37.159 --> 26:40.290
she developed depression
and anxiety disorders.

26:40.430 --> 26:42.829
Were there
any other external factors?

26:43.730 --> 26:45.129
Let me tell you again.

26:45.430 --> 26:47.530
Your company is the one...

26:49.230 --> 26:50.800
who made her like that.

26:54.139 --> 26:56.010
Please promise me something.

26:57.780 --> 26:59.509
That no matter what happens,

26:59.510 --> 27:02.109
you'll consider the safety
of your colleagues as your priority.

27:02.609 --> 27:05.550
Her expression
and the look in her eyes that day...

27:06.180 --> 27:08.550
At the very least,
those weren't lies.

27:39.520 --> 27:42.089
Sir. Your tail light is out!

27:43.220 --> 27:44.220
Your tail light!

28:10.919 --> 28:12.579
My goodness.

28:26.599 --> 28:27.700
Ms. Jung Eun Hee?

28:28.700 --> 28:29.700
Is anyone home?

28:30.169 --> 28:31.770
Can I come in?

28:33.770 --> 28:35.240
Ms. Jung Eun Hee.

28:35.909 --> 28:37.409
Is anyone home?

28:49.389 --> 28:51.720
Ms. Jung Eun Hee!

29:07.440 --> 29:10.540
I found a woman unconscious.

29:10.940 --> 29:11.980
Please send...

29:17.649 --> 29:19.619
Why would you visit her house?

29:20.790 --> 29:22.290
Hey.

29:23.389 --> 29:25.859
What were you planning to do
when you met her?

29:28.260 --> 29:29.629
I can't believe this.

29:30.129 --> 29:31.129
Hey.

29:37.339 --> 29:40.169
I apologize, Director Jung.
I can explain this.

29:43.879 --> 29:45.279
Did you give the order?

29:45.280 --> 29:46.600
Why are you still standing there?

29:46.950 --> 29:48.480
I said I would explain.

30:15.109 --> 30:16.139
Come in.

30:25.849 --> 30:28.449
I apologize, ma'am.
I shouldn't have done that.

30:28.450 --> 30:29.750
Don't worry about it.

30:30.159 --> 30:33.790
He loses his temper sometimes,
but he eventually calms down.

30:34.290 --> 30:37.059
By the way, why were you there?

30:37.230 --> 30:39.500
I wanted to check something.

30:39.599 --> 30:41.329
Check what?

30:41.829 --> 30:44.470
The last day
Jung Ki Sun went to North Korea.

30:45.040 --> 30:46.499
According to her
exit and entry records,

30:46.500 --> 30:49.069
the date Jung Ki Sun's cousin
testified was different.

30:51.579 --> 30:52.939
You went all the way down there...

30:53.550 --> 30:54.750
to verify that?

30:55.480 --> 30:56.510
Yes.

30:57.550 --> 30:59.350
It looked like Jung Eun Hee
committed suicide.

31:00.149 --> 31:02.190
But I don't understand
no matter how hard I try.

31:04.619 --> 31:05.659
Is there...

31:07.230 --> 31:08.790
something that troubles your mind?

31:15.470 --> 31:17.399
No, not exactly.

31:18.240 --> 31:20.099
Why are you
so obsessed with the case?

31:20.540 --> 31:21.609
Because I want to know.

31:21.669 --> 31:23.480
What do you mean?
What do you want to know?

31:24.079 --> 31:25.210
The truth.

31:26.710 --> 31:28.280
You don't know yet, do you?

31:30.149 --> 31:31.669
You don't know
how knowing the truth...

31:33.119 --> 31:35.250
makes you feel isolated.

31:36.750 --> 31:37.889
Can I...

31:38.790 --> 31:41.190
look into the case further?

31:46.559 --> 31:47.569
Sure.

31:49.169 --> 31:50.300
You can do that.

31:50.940 --> 31:51.970
Really?

31:52.099 --> 31:53.770
But if you find out something,

31:54.470 --> 31:56.510
you should report it to me first.

31:56.669 --> 31:59.079
You can at least do that, right?

32:00.510 --> 32:02.280
- Yes, ma'am.
- Good.

32:03.180 --> 32:04.319
Go back to work.

32:05.980 --> 32:08.589
And about the exit and entry records
from Chang'han.

32:09.520 --> 32:12.119
The Chinese don't like
to share information like that.

32:12.859 --> 32:15.290
Can I ask you
how we got the information?

32:15.790 --> 32:17.230
I don't know exactly how we got it.

32:18.700 --> 32:22.430
All I heard is that we got it
through an unofficial channel.

32:23.129 --> 32:24.200
I understand.

32:25.300 --> 32:26.339
Thank you, ma'am.

(Personal Information Record)

32:44.790 --> 32:46.089
(November 14, 2015)

32:47.089 --> 32:48.690
(February 23, 2016)

32:52.329 --> 32:54.629
Except for the testimony
of her cousin,

32:54.869 --> 32:56.628
the only thing that proves
Jung Ki Sun went to North Korea...

32:56.629 --> 32:57.939
is the exit and entry records...

32:57.940 --> 32:59.776
from the Chang'han Ministry
of Public Security.

That's the only evidence.

33:01.710 --> 33:03.139
I don't know exactly how we got it.

33:03.510 --> 33:07.280
All I heard is that we got it
through an unofficial channel.

33:08.849 --> 33:10.720
If we got it through
an unofficial channel,

33:10.919 --> 33:13.918
that means we got it
from a local black agent.

33:13.919 --> 33:14.990
(NIS)

33:15.520 --> 33:18.020
When the list was leaked a year ago,

33:18.819 --> 33:21.029
most of the black agents in China...

33:21.030 --> 33:23.190
were either arrested or deported.

33:24.200 --> 33:27.869
But the exit and entry records
were sent to us three months ago.

33:29.169 --> 33:31.169
That means an agent
has been active until recently.

33:32.399 --> 33:33.470
Then...

33:34.869 --> 33:35.869
(Chang Chun Woo)

33:38.980 --> 33:40.649
(Chang Chun Woo, NIS Black Agent)

33:41.450 --> 33:42.750
He's the only one.

33:43.480 --> 33:45.119
(Chang Chun Woo, NIS Black Agent)

33:46.819 --> 33:48.649
(Personnel Record, Chang Chun Woo)

34:15.809 --> 34:16.879
The usual.

34:24.389 --> 34:25.588
(Personnel Record, Chang Chun Woo)

34:25.589 --> 34:29.059
I'm sure he's the one who sent us
Jung Ki Sun's exit and entry records.

34:29.989 --> 34:31.029
Do you recognize him?

34:31.030 --> 34:33.099
It seems he was active
mainly in Shenyang.

34:33.230 --> 34:34.599
No, I don't remember him.

34:36.168 --> 34:38.069
How do you have
excess to these files?

34:38.500 --> 34:39.699
Have you already forgotten?

34:39.699 --> 34:41.440
I used to work
at Intelligence and Analysis.

34:42.139 --> 34:44.980
Anyone who works there
has 1 or 2 backdoors like this.

34:45.579 --> 34:47.980
He has a brilliant career.

34:48.409 --> 34:50.578
For several years, he infiltrated
factions of Samhwa Gang...

34:50.579 --> 34:53.049
such as Chunryeonbang
and Sangjinhae...

34:53.050 --> 34:54.550
as an undercover agent.

34:55.089 --> 34:58.158
We issued four
undercover identities for him.

34:58.159 --> 35:00.529
He's been making counterfeit bills,
forging passports,

35:00.530 --> 35:03.359
and making fake IDs in the gang.

35:05.200 --> 35:06.300
Where is he from?

35:06.800 --> 35:08.880
I looked into it
and found out he's a Korean-Chinese.

35:09.030 --> 35:11.940
He grew up in China and Hong Kong.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.440
There's something strange about him.

35:15.139 --> 35:18.209
When the list was leaked,
among all the black agents,

35:18.210 --> 35:20.280
he was the only one who survived.

35:21.909 --> 35:22.909
(Chang Chun Woo, NIS Black Agent)

35:22.910 --> 35:24.250
Where is he right now?

35:24.849 --> 35:26.079
I don't know.

35:26.419 --> 35:29.418
I tried to find him
but he's not even sending us...

35:29.419 --> 35:30.720
his periodical reports anymore.

35:36.530 --> 35:37.660
He's absorbed.

35:38.859 --> 35:40.228
What do you mean?

35:40.229 --> 35:42.898
Sometimes, undercover agents get
absorbed in their false identities.

35:42.899 --> 35:44.969
And when that happens,
they break off contact...

35:44.970 --> 35:46.839
with the agency and disappear.

35:47.069 --> 35:48.339
Maybe that's why.

35:49.209 --> 35:52.479
I couldn't even find his financial
and communication records.

35:52.709 --> 35:55.109
There's no way of finding him
if he doesn't want to be found.

35:56.680 --> 35:59.220
We should wait
until he decides to appear.

35:59.950 --> 36:01.089
What do we do now?

36:02.789 --> 36:04.219
You said
Chang'han Ministry of Public Security...

36:04.220 --> 36:06.160
issued the exit and entry records, right?

36:06.859 --> 36:07.859
Yes.

36:08.890 --> 36:12.100
Send an official document to confirm
if it's the original record.

36:12.229 --> 36:16.470
But China doesn't answer
to requests like that.

36:16.729 --> 36:18.339
Getting an answer isn't what I want.

36:19.740 --> 36:21.639
A black agent who has
enough local connections...

36:21.640 --> 36:23.879
to get their hands
on the entry log in secret is...

36:25.680 --> 36:26.910
bound to hear about...

36:28.450 --> 36:31.479
how we made a request
to see the original log.

36:33.050 --> 36:34.850
So you want to shake him up.

36:34.950 --> 36:36.819
Yes. Let's wait and see
how he'll react.

36:41.030 --> 36:44.959
(Chang Chun Woo, NIS Black Agent)

38:15.720 --> 38:17.120
Long time no see.

38:18.160 --> 38:19.289
Brother.

38:34.910 --> 38:36.769
(Unknown Caller)

38:51.089 --> 38:52.490
It's the third time already.

39:00.430 --> 39:01.600
Five o'clock.

39:02.300 --> 39:03.629
Two o'clock. Four o'clock.

39:04.569 --> 39:05.700
Know this.

39:05.870 --> 39:07.740
Your symptoms
always became severer...

39:07.939 --> 39:09.339
around that time of the year.

39:09.839 --> 39:11.379
May 24.

39:18.749 --> 39:20.280
A report on Ji Hyuk.

39:20.689 --> 39:21.990
You should take a look.

40:14.240 --> 40:16.910
It's the Korean professor couple
murder case in New York.

40:17.039 --> 40:19.938
Ji Hyuk's stepparents were murdered
in their home in Manhattan.

40:19.939 --> 40:21.379
I've seen this file already.

40:22.479 --> 40:24.580
Wasn't this a simple robbery?

40:25.419 --> 40:28.050
We haven't found the culprit yet.
It's an unresolved case.

40:28.289 --> 40:29.720
You'll see in the file...

40:29.919 --> 40:32.458
that Ji Hyuk was
only ten years old in Korean age.

40:32.459 --> 40:33.818
But he was found...

40:33.819 --> 40:36.830
only after the weekend has passed.

40:37.189 --> 40:39.859
He was there with his dead parents
for almost three days.

40:42.530 --> 40:43.830
What's this?

40:44.740 --> 40:46.870
That's why I wanted to see you.

40:46.970 --> 40:49.085
That's Ji Hyuk's medical records
from the time of the incident.

40:49.109 --> 40:52.039
He showed signs of aphasia
because of the shock,

40:52.180 --> 40:54.950
so they had a psychiatrist come in
and examine him.

40:55.609 --> 40:57.879
And his diagnosis happens to be...

40:58.180 --> 41:00.050
dissociative amnesia.

41:05.560 --> 41:07.760
(The Late Han Sung Jun,
The Late Lee Yeon Ju)

41:15.399 --> 41:17.499
He had dissociative amnesia.

41:18.069 --> 41:19.499
In other words,

41:19.700 --> 41:21.609
he wiped the memories
of his parents' murder...

41:21.839 --> 41:23.640
from his head.

41:27.010 --> 41:29.180
Do you think this is
just a coincidence?

41:29.479 --> 41:32.149
Ji Hyuk may not have recovered...

41:32.379 --> 41:35.120
from this troubled past,
when he was ten years old.

41:35.950 --> 41:39.660
And here's a list of drugs
he took over the years.

41:43.430 --> 41:44.659
Ms. Do!

41:44.660 --> 41:47.129
Ji Hyuk has already gone over his limit.

41:48.330 --> 41:50.769
We can no longer neglect his condition.

41:51.140 --> 41:53.169
There's something I'd like to know.

41:54.569 --> 41:55.939
Did you...

41:56.470 --> 41:59.080
really think
I didn't know this until this day?

42:00.109 --> 42:02.780
The drugs he had been abusing.

42:03.510 --> 42:05.620
His psychiatric diagnosis.

42:05.749 --> 42:06.850
All right.

42:07.789 --> 42:09.089
I'll admit it.

42:09.519 --> 42:12.120
I knew of his condition,
yet I chose to overlook it.

42:16.490 --> 42:17.959
What about you?

42:18.399 --> 42:20.030
Were you completely clueless?

42:20.760 --> 42:23.668
No, you did everything
in your power to stop this...

42:23.669 --> 42:25.199
from getting reported to me.

42:25.200 --> 42:28.470
- Ms. Do, it's...
- In the end, we're the same.

42:28.669 --> 42:31.709
If we have a goal to meet,
we're willing to pay a price,

42:33.140 --> 42:34.479
no matter what it may be.

42:39.950 --> 42:41.319
Do you really think so?

42:43.220 --> 42:47.530
Are you convinced that
Ji Hyuk will stand with us...

42:48.859 --> 42:52.399
even after he regains
all of his memories?

42:53.129 --> 42:54.200
"Us"?

42:55.870 --> 42:58.640
Am I included in that "us"?

43:05.979 --> 43:07.009
(To: Document Control, Chang'han
Ministry of Public Security)

43:07.010 --> 43:09.210
(Title: Request to check
the originals of the entry log)

43:15.450 --> 43:17.518
A black agent who has
enough local connections...

43:17.519 --> 43:19.919
to get their hands
on the entry log in secret is...

43:20.760 --> 43:22.260
bound to hear about...

43:23.560 --> 43:26.700
how we made a request
to see the original log.

43:27.200 --> 43:29.129
Let's wait and see
how they'll react.

43:34.939 --> 43:35.970
No.

43:37.410 --> 43:38.439
No.

43:38.680 --> 43:40.410
If you do that,
you might fall in danger.

43:41.680 --> 43:43.209
What do you mean?

43:45.019 --> 43:46.949
Is this yet another thing
you can't tell me about?

43:46.950 --> 43:48.019
Su Yeon.

43:48.720 --> 43:49.850
What on earth...

43:50.789 --> 43:52.890
are you hiding from me?

43:53.919 --> 43:55.660
I just need some time...

43:56.060 --> 43:58.700
I'm done being patient.

43:59.800 --> 44:00.859
Su Yeon.

44:57.249 --> 44:58.519
Can you do this?

44:59.289 --> 45:01.889
Yes, if I use a restoring program,

45:01.890 --> 45:03.859
you should be able to identify him.

45:04.160 --> 45:05.160
Anyway.

45:06.800 --> 45:08.030
What is this?

45:11.439 --> 45:12.939
How long will it take?

45:14.339 --> 45:17.169
I'm not sure,
but at least a few hours.

45:17.370 --> 45:19.810
I'll work on it,
then give you a call by tomorrow.

45:20.580 --> 45:21.879
No, do it here.

45:23.780 --> 45:24.919
Right here?

45:25.580 --> 45:27.649
I think they're about to close soon.

45:36.959 --> 45:38.330
Ji Hyuk, where should I do it?

45:49.140 --> 45:51.739
It uses deep learning.

45:51.740 --> 45:53.739
It changes the image
to a high-resolution file,

45:53.740 --> 45:56.280
then it tries to speculate
what the original image was.

45:56.609 --> 45:59.049
But my laptop doesn't have
great performance,

45:59.050 --> 46:00.919
so it's taking
longer than I thought.

46:01.149 --> 46:02.748
Do you see any other information?

46:02.749 --> 46:04.050
One second.

46:05.089 --> 46:08.390
Well, the metadata says...

46:08.760 --> 46:10.990
this was taken last year on March 3.

46:11.359 --> 46:13.659
It's taken
by a high-performance camera,

46:13.660 --> 46:16.330
a similar model to the ones we use
out on the field.

46:17.569 --> 46:18.700
But this file is...

46:19.300 --> 46:22.740
a little too big
to be just a picture.

46:26.410 --> 46:29.649
March 3 of last year is
3 days after I went to Shenyang.

46:31.350 --> 46:32.780
That means that picture is...

46:33.149 --> 46:35.689
Ji Hyuk, take a look.

46:36.319 --> 46:37.720
I think it's almost done.

46:44.189 --> 46:45.629
Can you zoom in here?

46:46.229 --> 46:47.359
One second.

46:55.470 --> 46:56.470
What?

47:11.859 --> 47:13.819
Why is he in this photo?

47:14.490 --> 47:16.330
That's what I want to know too.

47:16.629 --> 47:19.829
Go to the office and find everything
you can on Chang Chun Woo.

47:19.830 --> 47:22.230
And find out his relationships
with the people I'll name now.

47:23.030 --> 47:24.030
Okay.

47:46.060 --> 47:47.289
No. I can't...

47:48.330 --> 47:49.959
conclude anything yet.

48:04.640 --> 48:08.279
"We'd like to inform you that
this is not an official document..."

48:08.280 --> 48:13.050
"issued by the Chang'han
Ministry of Public Security."

48:25.499 --> 48:27.260
I was just dropping by.

48:28.200 --> 48:29.729
You're already getting off work?

48:29.830 --> 48:30.830
Yes.

48:31.899 --> 48:32.899
What's that?

48:40.439 --> 48:41.549
It's an official document...

48:41.550 --> 48:43.390
from the Chang'han Ministry
of Public Security.

48:44.620 --> 48:46.248
They never issued a document...

48:46.249 --> 48:47.889
for Jung Ki Sun's exit and entry records.

48:48.990 --> 48:51.490
Someone fabricated the record.

48:52.060 --> 48:54.830
It wasn't true that Jung Ki Sun
had been visiting North Korea.

48:55.129 --> 48:57.358
It's odd that her cousin died
out of the blue.

48:57.359 --> 48:59.160
I'm sure something has gone wrong here.

48:59.830 --> 49:01.999
We must reinvestigate the case
from square one.

49:02.129 --> 49:05.039
I understand.
Let me handle this then.

49:09.439 --> 49:12.280
- Let me handle everything.
- Pardon?

49:13.140 --> 49:14.850
Who else knows about this?

49:15.379 --> 49:17.580
You didn't make any copies, right?

49:18.080 --> 49:19.620
Why are you asking me that?

49:20.780 --> 49:21.850
Listen up.

49:22.220 --> 49:26.019
From now on, I have to be
the only one who knows about this.

49:26.359 --> 49:28.490
- Chief Seo.
- It's an order.

49:28.589 --> 49:29.930
Just do what I say.

49:30.930 --> 49:34.260
Is it because of Chang Chun Woo?

49:39.769 --> 49:41.240
How do you know his name?

49:41.609 --> 49:44.140
Chang Chun Woo fabricated
Jung Ki Sun's...

49:44.879 --> 49:46.879
- exit and entry records. Right?
- That's enough.

49:47.839 --> 49:50.850
You can't mention his name
this casually.

49:51.319 --> 49:53.818
No. I cannot let this slide.

49:53.819 --> 49:54.850
Yes.

49:56.019 --> 49:58.088
- You must.
- Why?

49:58.089 --> 49:59.120
You will...

49:59.890 --> 50:01.689
find out the answer soon enough.

50:03.089 --> 50:04.260
Given what happened,

50:06.100 --> 50:07.830
I won't just sit back and watch.

50:09.499 --> 50:11.999
You should go now. Good work.

50:22.379 --> 50:23.749
(Yoo Je Yi)

50:27.419 --> 50:29.220
- Sir.
- Go ahead.

50:29.450 --> 50:32.089
I just got a reply from
the Chang'han Ministry of Public Security.

50:32.689 --> 50:35.359
The exit and entry records were
fabricated as expected.

50:36.089 --> 50:37.959
I'm positive
Chang Chun Woo was behind it too.

50:38.830 --> 50:41.629
And like you suspected,
they were connected.

50:42.169 --> 50:43.669
Chang Chun Woo and Chief Seo.

50:44.300 --> 50:47.470
They were on the same projects
four and six years ago.

50:47.839 --> 50:51.709
And during the second project,
Chief Seo wrote a report.

50:51.910 --> 50:54.910
Her report mentioned
his psychological state too.

50:57.050 --> 50:58.050
Are you there?

50:58.479 --> 51:00.079
Yes, I'm here. Keep talking.

51:00.080 --> 51:03.418
The report said he had been working
as an undercover for a long time,

51:03.419 --> 51:04.989
so he was going through
psychological issues...

51:04.990 --> 51:06.919
such as the loss
of self-identity and confusion.

51:07.319 --> 51:10.089
And she urged that the project
should be halted immediately.

51:10.729 --> 51:13.499
There's something between them.
I can sense it.

51:14.629 --> 51:15.729
Where are you now?

51:15.899 --> 51:17.769
I'm on my way to you now.

51:18.939 --> 51:20.939
Remember the burger joint
we went to the other day?

51:21.510 --> 51:22.709
Let's meet there.

52:22.399 --> 52:24.069
(Yoo Je Yi)

52:29.370 --> 52:30.410
Where are you?

52:31.640 --> 52:34.749
Sir, I'm in the basement
parking lot. Hurry!

52:35.080 --> 52:36.080
Hey.

53:32.339 --> 53:34.339
(Yoo Je Yi)

53:36.109 --> 53:37.109
It's been a while.

53:37.839 --> 53:38.839
Who are you?

53:39.379 --> 53:40.479
Who am I?

53:41.339 --> 53:42.810
That's a hard question to answer.

53:44.379 --> 53:47.620
I don't know who I am anymore.

53:48.950 --> 53:50.089
Chang Chun Woo, right?

53:51.890 --> 53:53.220
It feels nice...

53:53.919 --> 53:55.459
to hear that name again.

54:12.580 --> 54:13.640
By any chance,

54:14.780 --> 54:18.519
have you ever thought
about your existence?

54:25.720 --> 54:29.289
Back then, you were like a sword.

54:30.330 --> 54:33.499
You were so sharp that
a gentle touch would end in a cut.

54:37.800 --> 54:41.839
But now, you are
too impatient and reckless.

54:43.470 --> 54:45.538
You don't care that
your colleague is in the car, right?

54:45.539 --> 54:47.240
As long as
you get what you want, right?

54:48.140 --> 54:49.149
Shut it!

57:01.179 --> 57:03.150
Take a look behind you.

57:08.019 --> 57:09.320
Take a good look at it...

57:09.920 --> 57:12.519
because that's exactly who you are.

57:25.329 --> 57:27.400
Yoo Je Yi. Look here!

57:27.639 --> 57:29.339
Wake up! Yoo Je Yi!

57:29.340 --> 57:31.309
Wake up, Je Yi.

57:38.880 --> 57:40.449
Je Yi. Wake up.

57:42.079 --> 57:44.149
Wake up, Yoo Je Yi!

57:44.150 --> 57:45.250
No.

57:46.320 --> 57:47.889
Dad, no.

57:48.519 --> 57:49.789
Dad...

57:59.900 --> 58:01.070
Chang Chun Woo.

58:02.840 --> 58:04.210
Where are you? Answer me.

58:05.440 --> 58:06.980
Do you get it now?

58:08.280 --> 58:10.209
Do you understand
what will happen...

58:10.210 --> 58:12.530
to the people around you
if you continue digging into this?

58:14.619 --> 58:16.149
You'll just put them in pain.

58:16.150 --> 58:18.219
All because of your terrible ego.

58:19.860 --> 58:22.389
Stop doing what you were doing.

58:24.190 --> 58:26.300
I just came to tell you that.

58:27.730 --> 58:31.300
Who was it?
Who told you to tell me that?

58:32.429 --> 58:36.110
You can't catch them
just because you know who they are.

58:55.760 --> 58:56.860
No.

58:57.730 --> 58:58.929
You were wrong.

59:00.829 --> 59:02.900
You should've felt guilt...

59:04.130 --> 59:05.969
before you felt anger.

59:31.889 --> 59:33.329
- I'm okay.
- Okay.

59:33.630 --> 59:35.399
I still feel a bit of pain though.

59:35.400 --> 59:37.300
- It will get better.
- Thank you.

59:41.000 --> 59:42.199
Sir.

59:44.110 --> 59:45.908
Luckily, there is nothing wrong
with my bones.

59:45.909 --> 59:48.510
I have strong bones, you see.

59:48.909 --> 59:50.880
But are you okay?

59:51.449 --> 59:53.019
Are you feeling any discomfort?

59:55.480 --> 59:58.190
You should go in. I'll call you.

01:00:00.119 --> 01:00:01.260
Sir.

01:00:12.570 --> 01:00:14.769
It's me. Can we meet up?

01:00:16.039 --> 01:00:18.039
Okay. This is good.

01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:21.610
I had something to say to you too.

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:24.109
No. Send me your location.

01:00:24.110 --> 01:00:25.710
I'll go to you.

01:00:26.219 --> 01:00:27.320
Okay.

01:00:46.039 --> 01:00:47.070
Bang!

01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:56.909
Han Ji Hyuk.

01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:02.179
What's this?

01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:04.489
What's wrong with your face?

01:01:05.019 --> 01:01:06.360
It's nothing.

01:01:07.719 --> 01:01:08.719
Okay.

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:14.699
Shall we take a walk while we talk?

01:01:17.369 --> 01:01:20.300
The work that we risk
our lives for...

01:01:20.599 --> 01:01:22.570
is meaningless...

01:01:23.239 --> 01:01:25.170
once you take a step out.

01:01:26.679 --> 01:01:27.780
Do you remember?

01:01:28.079 --> 01:01:30.679
When we first joined
and were trainees,

01:01:30.849 --> 01:01:33.619
you and I were partners.

01:01:34.219 --> 01:01:36.320
On the last day we ran up
the mountain,

01:01:36.719 --> 01:01:40.419
I hurt my ankle, and you left me...

01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:41.989
to finish on your own.

01:01:42.690 --> 01:01:44.429
That's when I first thought,

01:01:44.590 --> 01:01:47.000
"How does such
a selfish person exist?"

01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:49.829
But now that I look back,

01:01:50.369 --> 01:01:52.899
you didn't do it to look good
for someone...

01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:55.139
or to get points for it.

01:01:55.699 --> 01:01:58.868
The mission itself
was important to you.

01:01:58.869 --> 01:02:00.710
More than relationships with other people.

01:02:05.849 --> 01:02:07.019
Have you...

01:02:08.079 --> 01:02:10.519
ever gone down a path...

01:02:10.989 --> 01:02:12.320
that you knew was wrong?

01:02:16.530 --> 01:02:18.260
I'm sure you never did.

01:02:19.090 --> 01:02:21.259
You don't get tied down by anyone,

01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:22.800
nor can anyone sway you.

01:02:24.599 --> 01:02:27.099
I'm envious of that aspect
about you.

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:29.510
If I were you,

01:02:30.969 --> 01:02:32.710
I never would've made...

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:35.280
such a foolish decision.

01:02:47.659 --> 01:02:48.789
Ji Hyuk.

01:02:54.099 --> 01:02:56.070
Before I dated Kyung Seok,

01:02:58.070 --> 01:03:00.239
there was someone I was
really indebted to.

01:03:02.099 --> 01:03:03.610
And that person...

01:03:04.010 --> 01:03:07.809
made a request that
I couldn't refuse.

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:12.210
Who was it?

01:03:13.119 --> 01:03:15.219
I should've refused,

01:03:17.349 --> 01:03:18.719
but I couldn't.

01:03:20.889 --> 01:03:22.320
Was it Chang Chun Woo?

01:03:31.429 --> 01:03:32.599
Ji Hyuk.

01:03:37.809 --> 01:03:38.909
I...

01:04:07.170 --> 01:04:08.170
Ji Hyuk.

01:04:11.139 --> 01:04:12.710
Su Yeon.

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:19.380
Don't talk.

01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:21.920
Don't say anything. Stay still.

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:24.690
Can you call an ambulance?

01:04:24.849 --> 01:04:26.719
Can you call an ambulance for us?
Hurry!

01:04:27.289 --> 01:04:30.159
- Oh, my goodness.
- She got shot!

01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:45.340
Don't trust anyone.

01:04:55.349 --> 01:04:57.849
Seo Su Yeon. Wake up!

01:04:58.449 --> 01:05:01.119
Seo Su Yeon! Wake up!

01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:02.320
Seo Su Yeon!

01:05:04.059 --> 01:05:06.230
Seo Su Yeon!

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.030
(In Surgery)

01:05:37.159 --> 01:05:40.460
(Central Operating Room,
Operating Center)

01:05:44.429 --> 01:05:45.570
Mr. Han Ji Hyuk?

01:05:49.969 --> 01:05:52.538
- I'm back.
- I heard you were in an accident.

01:05:52.539 --> 01:05:53.578
My goodness.

01:05:53.579 --> 01:05:56.009
You hurt your pretty face!

01:05:56.010 --> 01:05:58.509
I told you to stay home
and get rest.

01:05:58.510 --> 01:06:00.750
I didn't get hurt badly. It's okay.

01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:03.989
Je Yi, can you take a look at this?

01:06:04.519 --> 01:06:06.050
My goodness.

01:06:07.690 --> 01:06:11.189
This is additional evidence sent
to us by the Shenyang Consulate.

01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:14.599
It's the CCTV footage taken
at Chang'han's immigration control.

01:06:15.159 --> 01:06:17.869
That's the entry to North Korea.

01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:41.590
Are testifiers questioned
in a room like this these days?

01:06:42.159 --> 01:06:44.130
This is the only place available.

01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:45.760
Please do understand.

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:52.099
So the victim of the gunfire is
Ms. Seo Su Yeon.

01:06:56.309 --> 01:06:58.369
- Yes.
- What's your relationship with her?

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:02.539
What's your relationship with her?

01:07:10.449 --> 01:07:11.449
Mr. Han.

01:07:12.289 --> 01:07:13.460
Look here.

01:07:14.119 --> 01:07:15.260
She's my colleague.

01:07:18.530 --> 01:07:20.630
According to your testimony,

01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:23.198
you were standing at the crosswalk
when the incident happened,

01:07:23.199 --> 01:07:25.598
and someone suddenly showed up,
opened fire, and ran off.

01:07:25.599 --> 01:07:26.670
Is that so?

01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:29.300
Yes.

01:07:31.070 --> 01:07:34.638
A man in a black baseball cap.
Height, about 175cm.

01:07:34.639 --> 01:07:36.880
A burly man in his 20s or 30s.

01:07:38.079 --> 01:07:40.719
What are you doing?
I already told you...

01:07:41.619 --> 01:07:43.920
every little detail
without leaving anything out.

01:07:44.190 --> 01:07:46.489
You should check the CCTV again.

01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:50.460
That's why...

01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:54.530
we checked the CCTV footage
of the crime scene.

01:07:57.599 --> 01:07:58.799
Would you like to take a look?

01:08:15.179 --> 01:08:16.349
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:08:18.719 --> 01:08:20.158
We don't need to look further.

01:08:20.158 --> 01:08:22.658
Jung Ki Sun went to North Korea.

01:08:22.658 --> 01:08:24.959
And the date is November 24,

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:27.000
so the timing is perfect too.

01:08:28.198 --> 01:08:29.868
Hyo Eun, one second.

01:08:32.769 --> 01:08:35.368
(November 24, 2015)

01:08:36.170 --> 01:08:37.170
No.

01:08:38.408 --> 01:08:39.939
No, something's wrong.

01:09:26.250 --> 01:09:29.219
(The Veil)

01:09:59.449 --> 01:10:02.419
Deputy Commissioner Do,
I heard you ignored...

01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:04.688
Han Ji Hyuk's condition
even though you were aware of it.

01:10:04.689 --> 01:10:07.129
You can't cover it up like this.

01:10:07.130 --> 01:10:09.159
I'm not the one
who wants this covered up.

01:10:09.359 --> 01:10:10.669
It's you.

01:10:10.670 --> 01:10:12.799
Why won't you ask to find out
if I really shot Su Yeon?

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:15.340
Why won't you ask me anything?

01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:18.439
Ji Hyuk, I can't lose you too.

01:10:18.710 --> 01:10:21.479
I'm asking you right now.

01:10:21.779 --> 01:10:23.879
That wasn't you, was it?

01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:27.049
If you get involved with him,
you won't even die in peace.

01:10:27.050 --> 01:10:29.648
Get a grip, everyone.
We're up against Ji Hyuk.

01:10:29.649 --> 01:10:31.350
We're allowed to take him down?
