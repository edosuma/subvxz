00:07.545 --> 00:09.580
<i> Also, she has a thing for Gary,</i>

00:09.615 --> 00:11.650

for cosmic three-ways...</i>

00:11.685 --> 00:15.650

a breach to close in space...</i>

00:15.685 --> 00:16.954

00:19.720 --> 00:23.930
<i>Gary, you have
two minutes of oxygen left.</i>

00:27.000 --> 00:28.730
Can we...

00:28.765 --> 00:31.330
change that
to something more cheerful?

00:31.365 --> 00:33.130
<i> Sure, Gary.</i>

00:33.140 --> 00:34.374
Cookies.

00:34.375 --> 00:36.940
Act like you're baking
a big batch of cookies.

00:36.975 --> 00:40.540
<i>Gary, the cookies will
be done in two minutes.</i>

00:40.575 --> 00:45.680
Oh... fantastic.
I love cookies.

00:45.715 --> 00:48.280
What kind of cookies
we talkin' about?

00:48.315 --> 00:50.350
<i> Butter wheat crunch.</i>

00:50.385 --> 00:53.290
That's... not a cookie.

00:53.325 --> 00:57.830

You know that!

01:36.595 --> 01:38.700
Are you ready to save the Earth?!

01:38.735 --> 01:40.900
- Hooray! Oh, yeah!
- Hooray! Hooray!

01:40.935 --> 01:43.430
The question is, Captain, are you ready?

01:43.440 --> 01:45.300
I'm so ready!

01:45.335 --> 01:48.640
I'm so not ready! How am I
gonna save an entire planet?

01:48.675 --> 01:50.144
I'm all for trying,

01:50.145 --> 01:53.980

01:54.015 --> 01:56.510
<i>Yes. It's more or less a done deal.</i>

01:56.520 --> 01:58.580
That's not comforting at all!

01:58.615 --> 02:03.050
I can do this, right? Right?!
Oh, this is impossible!

02:03.060 --> 02:08.130
Nothing is impossible
if we apply our minds to it.

02:08.164 --> 02:11.600
H.U.E., do we know of a way
we can close this breach?

02:11.635 --> 02:13.400
<i>- No.
- Well, that's not good.</i>

02:13.435 --> 02:16.234
Okay, uh, well...
anything at all we could do?

02:16.235 --> 02:18.740
<i> Yes. You can kiss
your cheeks goodbye.</i>

02:18.775 --> 02:20.104
You givin' me a little clap back?

02:20.105 --> 02:22.210
You givin' me
the old clap back, H.U.E.?!

02:22.245 --> 02:25.880
<i>I thought I'd give it a try
before we implode into nothingness.</i>

02:25.915 --> 02:30.610
"Implode into nothingness," he said!

02:30.620 --> 02:33.480
Oh, my gosh.
Freaking Mondays.

02:33.490 --> 02:37.124
- Gary, am I gonna die?
- Are you trying to cheer me up, KVN?

02:37.125 --> 02:40.420
Okay, because you dying would
be a wonderful development.

Shut the hell up, KVN.
Or I will find ways.

02:47.135 --> 02:49.770
Actually, there is a way.

02:49.805 --> 02:53.840
H.U.E., set coordinates
for sector 12, region 6.79.

02:53.875 --> 02:57.440
<i>Nightfall, that would fly us
directly into the sun</i>

02:57.475 --> 02:59.014
<i>at the heart of the Orion Nebula.</i>

02:59.015 --> 03:02.710
- I know.
- We are not flying into a sun!

03:02.720 --> 03:05.414
- Do you want to live?
- Yes. I would love to live.

03:05.415 --> 03:09.120
That's exactly freaking why
we're not flying into a sun!

03:09.155 --> 03:11.660
You're right.
We're going to lightfold in.

03:12.695 --> 03:16.530
That's freaking worse!
You said it like it was better,

03:16.565 --> 03:19.834
- but that is the opposite of better!
- I would never suggest this

03:19.835 --> 03:22.130
unless I knew something
you're not sharing.

03:22.140 --> 03:23.234
What do you know?

03:23.235 --> 03:27.140
Quinn, aren't you curious
how you became me?

03:27.175 --> 03:29.540
If that answers even
involves flying into a sun,

03:29.575 --> 03:32.044
I'm not curious.
I don't think anybody's curious.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.514
- Aah!
- I'm curious! Keep going!

03:33.515 --> 03:35.114
Must you, KVN?!

03:35.115 --> 03:37.010
- Must you?!
- Hee-hee hoo.

03:37.020 --> 03:40.750
- Tell me.
- There's only one being who can help us.

03:40.785 --> 03:42.254
A Titan who inhabits a realm

03:42.255 --> 03:45.020
between our dimension and
the next called Inner Space.

03:45.055 --> 03:49.230
He came to me.
At my lowest point.

03:56.640 --> 04:00.570
It's over.
Everything is over.

04:02.275 --> 04:03.944
I'm coming, Gary.

04:03.945 --> 04:07.640
<i>This is not your fate.</i>

04:07.650 --> 04:11.680
<i>I offer not madness, but salvation.</i>

04:13.050 --> 04:15.720
<i>We can change what has become.</i>

04:15.755 --> 04:19.519
- How?
- A machine to traverse time.

04:19.529 --> 04:23.190
<i>You can construct it.
With my help.</i>

04:23.200 --> 04:25.660
- Who are you?
- Bolo.

04:25.670 --> 04:28.530
<i>A fellow victim of infinity.</i>

04:28.565 --> 04:31.870
<i>And now we fight back.</i>

04:31.905 --> 04:34.810
<i>- Who's Bolo?
- He's a Titan.</i>

04:34.845 --> 04:37.140
<i>The Titans are
terrible, vengeful creatures</i>

04:37.175 --> 04:39.880
<i>who poison the universe with chaos.</i>

04:39.915 --> 04:42.210
<i>Each in charge of a different realm.</i>

04:42.220 --> 04:46.350
<i>One broke ranks.
Bolo.</i>

04:46.385 --> 04:48.890
<i>He saw there was a better way
and sealed off our dimension</i>

04:48.925 --> 04:50.950
<i>from the horrors of Final Space.</i>

04:50.960 --> 04:53.890
<i>They took revenge and imprisoned him.</i>

04:53.925 --> 04:56.290
<i>He's the only one who can help.</i>

04:56.300 --> 04:57.864
That's sick.

04:57.865 --> 05:00.030
Older hot Quinn
makes an excellent point.

05:00.065 --> 05:04.534
If Bolo's the only one that can
help us, we've got no choice.

05:04.535 --> 05:06.570
- Chookity pok!
- Well said, Mooncake.

05:06.605 --> 05:08.570
Let's fly through a sun!

05:08.605 --> 05:11.880
Oh, my Lord,
I cannot believe we are doing this.

05:15.085 --> 05:17.850
Dimension phasing
is notoriously difficult.

05:17.885 --> 05:19.720
To see Bolo, we're going
to have to lightfold

05:19.755 --> 05:21.590
exactly through the sun's aperture.

05:21.625 --> 05:25.920
<i> If we are off by even one
degree, we burn up and die.</i>

05:25.930 --> 05:28.460
<i> Buckle up.
This will be a bumpy ride.</i>

05:28.495 --> 05:31.060
All right, H.U.E.
Take us in!

05:34.165 --> 05:37.470
<i>Entering into the corona of the sun.</i>

05:42.645 --> 05:45.810
<i> The heat of the sun has melted
through the navigation system.</i>

05:45.845 --> 05:48.950
<i> You will need to manually
navigate it into the aperture.</i>

05:48.985 --> 05:52.454
- All right, I'll do it.
- But you're not a good pilot.

05:52.455 --> 05:55.420
Thank you very much for
believing in me, Quinn!

05:55.455 --> 05:58.394
- Please do not screw this up.
- Okay, that's not helping!

05:58.395 --> 06:00.629
Concentrate, Gary.
You gotta do this.

06:00.630 --> 06:02.330
Let's thread this needle.

06:06.935 --> 06:09.100
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

06:16.380 --> 06:18.614
- Gary! Center it!
- I got this!

06:18.615 --> 06:20.214
You got this, Thunder Bandit!

06:20.215 --> 06:21.915
No, you don't!
Center it!

06:21.945 --> 06:24.484
- Oh, you're scaring me! I'm scared!
- Center it!

06:24.485 --> 06:25.684
I'm very frightened!

06:25.685 --> 06:27.590
- Gary!
- Aah!

06:29.250 --> 06:33.129
Oh, my crap!
Oh, my crap.

06:34.895 --> 06:38.260
Welcome to Inner Space.

06:46.075 --> 06:48.240
Just our luck.
He's... asleep.

06:48.275 --> 06:50.980
Gary, he's been asleep
for 10,000 years.

06:51.015 --> 06:55.310
- Well, then why are we here?
- Wait for it.

06:55.345 --> 06:57.650
Wait for wha...

07:11.565 --> 07:13.930
Get me the hell out of here!

07:18.310 --> 07:22.940
Did we just get sucked
into dude's mind?

07:22.975 --> 07:26.080
- Don't worry, that's normal.
- I am not okay with this ...

07:26.115 --> 07:30.750
winter wonderland
of cosmic cotton candy!

07:30.785 --> 07:32.750
Aah! Aah!

07:32.785 --> 07:36.690
I'm just gonna put this down
right on this little lily pad.

07:36.725 --> 07:40.360
Oh, there we go.

07:46.735 --> 07:50.239
Oh, hey, there's a guy.
Hey. Hey!

07:50.240 --> 07:52.440
So, not sure we're in the right place,

07:52.475 --> 07:55.604
- but we got this thing ...
- You're late!

07:55.605 --> 07:57.710
- Late?
- Yes, late!

07:57.745 --> 08:02.180
- He's been waiting on you for years!
- You're like a giant flaming M&M.

08:02.215 --> 08:05.380
Excuse me?!
Are you giving me sass?!

08:05.415 --> 08:06.589
Hyah!

08:06.590 --> 08:08.024
Oh! Freaking...!
Did you just

08:08.025 --> 08:11.294
whack me in the face with your stick?!
Aah!

08:11.295 --> 08:13.930
You and I are not gonna get along.

08:20.930 --> 08:23.939
Explain...
to me...

08:23.940 --> 08:25.174
what just happened.

08:25.175 --> 08:27.340
We hopped over
to brain chamber two.

08:27.375 --> 08:29.679
Hopped?
No, no, no, no!

08:29.680 --> 08:32.039
We were hurled ...

08:36.080 --> 08:39.183
Oh, there's moisture. Am I...?

08:39.184 --> 08:41.090
I think my eyes are bleeding!

08:42.525 --> 08:45.290
My eyes!
Blood! Blood!

08:45.325 --> 08:48.860
This is only Brain Chamber Six.

08:58.770 --> 09:02.040
Here we are.
Chamber number 795.

09:02.075 --> 09:04.040
Bolo's Mind Palace.

09:04.075 --> 09:07.180
Beyond this point,
only one of you may enter,

09:07.215 --> 09:10.450
and it's already been pre-selected.

09:10.485 --> 09:13.650
Yooooou!

09:13.685 --> 09:15.390
You've been chosen.

09:15.425 --> 09:18.190
But then again,
you were already selected

09:18.225 --> 09:21.260
before you were even born!

09:21.295 --> 09:23.330
- We'll be here, Gary.
- You got this!

09:24.695 --> 09:28.200

Oh, look!

10:21.725 --> 10:25.134
- There's a Construction Hat Gary.
- Hey!

10:25.135 --> 10:27.300
There's an Eagle-Faced Gary.

10:27.335 --> 10:28.734
Hi!

10:28.735 --> 10:32.004
- Cookie-Headed Gary.
- Hi. What's up?

10:32.005 --> 10:35.274
Oh, my gosh!
Little Micro Gary.

10:35.275 --> 10:37.110
- Hey!
- Who's that?

10:37.145 --> 10:39.780
<i>That's the Amazing Mustache Gary.</i>

10:39.815 --> 10:43.910
Gary, you're never gonna
be able to grow one of these.

10:43.920 --> 10:49.520
A thick, rich,
luscious mustache.

10:52.025 --> 10:54.660
Hell yeah, that feels good!

10:54.695 --> 10:57.599
It's true. I've never been
able to grow a mustache.

10:57.600 --> 11:03.070
I wish I was a crumb,
so I could get caught in this.

11:03.105 --> 11:04.782
What are you doing, Mustache Gary?

11:04.783 --> 11:08.870
Combing my Mustache
with my Little Mustache Comb!

11:08.880 --> 11:12.940
But you'll never know
the satisfaction of that.

11:15.115 --> 11:18.480
Oh, it feels so gooooood!

11:18.490 --> 11:21.890
Ugh, it's so true.
I won't.

11:21.925 --> 11:24.924
Oh, no.
What is this?

11:24.925 --> 11:26.194
Aah! What's happening?!

11:26.195 --> 11:29.030
<i>Your anxiety is consuming you.</i>

11:29.065 --> 11:31.760
<i>You know you can't succeed.</i>

11:31.795 --> 11:33.830
Because I can't
grow a 'stache?

11:33.865 --> 11:37.700
That's exactly why.

11:39.770 --> 11:42.310
<i>You're no hero.</i>

11:42.345 --> 11:45.310
<i>Your father was.</i>

11:47.450 --> 11:51.320
You're right.
He would've figured this out.

11:51.355 --> 11:54.250
I'm scared there's no winning this,

11:54.285 --> 11:55.954
that there's no way
to close this breach

11:55.955 --> 11:58.860
without losing my friends.

11:58.895 --> 12:02.199
Okay.
Let's not do that again!

12:02.200 --> 12:05.530
<i>All progress begins with the truth.</i>

12:05.565 --> 12:07.660
We're running out of time.

12:07.670 --> 12:11.140
I need to know right now
how to close this breach.

12:11.175 --> 12:15.397
<i>I don't have the answer for you,
but he will.</i>

12:15.432 --> 12:17.670
Who the hell is "He Will?"
I don't know a "He Will."

12:17.680 --> 12:20.610
<i>You'll only have a short time.</i>

12:42.855 --> 12:45.360
- He's fine.
- Show them, Gatekeeper.

12:45.395 --> 12:49.430
Reveal your secrets!

12:49.465 --> 12:52.830

- Dad? Who the hell are you?

13:09.615 --> 13:12.789
And why did time freeze?
Did you freeze time?

13:12.790 --> 13:14.520
You time-freezing demon!

13:14.555 --> 13:16.390
Whoa! Okay, look.
I don't think you would

13:16.425 --> 13:18.390
believe me if I told you
how I got here.

13:18.425 --> 13:20.930
But I'm telling you I am your son.

13:20.965 --> 13:24.730
My son is much younger,
a boy half your age.

13:24.765 --> 13:28.330
If you're really my son,
what was the promise?

13:28.365 --> 13:30.034
- What?
- Before I left.

13:30.035 --> 13:35.540
To have my adventures.
Bunches and bunches of them.

13:35.575 --> 13:39.280
- Is it really you?
- As real as it gets, Dad.

13:42.150 --> 13:45.820
Oh, hell yeah.

13:48.185 --> 13:49.890
What the hell are you doing here?

13:49.925 --> 13:52.220
It's a real novel, but I'm
trying to save the Earth ...

13:52.230 --> 13:56.184
actually universe sounds way cooler,
so I'm actually gonna say

13:56.185 --> 13:58.334
- "universe" from now on.
- You're what?

13:58.335 --> 14:00.700
I'm trying to find out how
to close a breach in space

14:00.735 --> 14:02.500
that will most certainly
destroy Earth ...

14:02.535 --> 14:05.874
actually universe ... in my time.
God, that sounds so cool.

14:05.875 --> 14:08.640
I really feel cool
saying that out loud.

14:08.675 --> 14:09.779
Well, that's what I'm doing now!

14:09.780 --> 14:11.710
- What?
- You're doing what I'm doing.

14:11.745 --> 14:13.580
- I'm doing what you're doing!
- No way!

14:13.615 --> 14:17.380
- Look!
- You're closing the breach in space?

14:17.415 --> 14:20.221
Me and my co-pilot, yeah.

14:33.470 --> 14:35.834
- What is he doing here?!
- Jack's my co-pilot.

14:35.835 --> 14:37.740
We've been doing missions
together for years.

14:37.775 --> 14:41.070
Jack?! This guy
is the Lord Commander!

14:41.105 --> 14:43.210
- Who?
- The guy who ripped my arm off

14:43.245 --> 14:45.740
with his mind
and killed my best friend.

14:45.750 --> 14:50.880
Jack is my co-pilot.
He's been my friend for 29 years.

14:50.915 --> 14:52.820
But I'll take your word for it.

14:52.855 --> 14:55.620
Well, what do you say we beat
the crap out of him, son?

14:55.655 --> 14:58.160
You are my dad.

14:58.195 --> 15:01.264
Hey!
You sick sack of ...

15:01.265 --> 15:02.499
Gah!

15:02.500 --> 15:03.664
Ha! Heyyy!

15:03.665 --> 15:06.734
Heyyyyyy!
Multiple punches in the face!

15:06.735 --> 15:10.170
Every boy dreams of building
cherished memories...

15:10.205 --> 15:11.874
- Harder!
- ...with his dad.

15:11.875 --> 15:14.510
- Like this.
- Kick him in the nuts!

15:14.545 --> 15:15.579
Oh, and this!

15:15.580 --> 15:16.779
Oh, and these!

15:16.780 --> 15:21.850
- Hyah!
- That's my boy.

15:21.885 --> 15:23.585
When was the last time
you saw me?

15:23.615 --> 15:26.380
Right before this mission.

15:26.390 --> 15:28.824
- You never came back.
- Hm.

15:28.825 --> 15:32.494
- So, I'm about to die, huh?
- Not if I can help it.

15:32.495 --> 15:34.790
So how are we gonna
close this breach?

15:34.825 --> 15:38.130
- I need to know for me.
- An anti-matter bomb detonated

15:38.165 --> 15:40.000
at the event horizon of the breach.

15:40.035 --> 15:42.200
The thing is,
right before you came aboard,

15:42.235 --> 15:45.600
an energy blast in Final Space
was about to hit our ship.

15:45.610 --> 15:48.670
Time froze, and now there's
no way to deliver the bomb.

15:48.680 --> 15:50.410
- Unless...
- Hit me.

15:50.445 --> 15:51.574
Nice.

15:51.575 --> 15:54.610
Thanks. What if you take out
the bomb manually?

15:54.645 --> 15:56.184
- That could work.
- Really?

15:56.185 --> 15:59.550
Wow, I mean,
we could do it together.

15:59.585 --> 16:03.254
<i>Mooncake.
It's time you knew.</i>

16:03.255 --> 16:05.090
Whoa, look at all
this cool brain stuff.

16:05.125 --> 16:09.360
Hmm. That's mine, and
that's mine, and that's mine.

16:09.395 --> 16:12.436
Hey, let's do Jell-O shots
with the brain goo!

16:13.430 --> 16:17.040
<i>You're the key to Final Space...</i>

16:17.075 --> 16:19.970
<i>because that's what you're made of.</i>

16:20.005 --> 16:21.770
<i>Final Space.</i>

16:28.345 --> 16:31.050
Chockity.

16:32.720 --> 16:36.050
We'll need to take out the
primary and secondary trigger.

16:36.060 --> 16:38.120
Right. I have no idea what that is,

16:38.155 --> 16:41.530
so I'm gonna look at you
and nod in agreement.

16:41.565 --> 16:46.069
- So, you met anybody?
- No, well, kind of.

16:46.070 --> 16:48.330
I'm seeing two people
at the same time ... but mainly,

16:48.365 --> 16:51.400
I'm not like cheating because
they're the same person.

16:51.435 --> 16:53.104
Got it.
Time-travel thing?

16:53.105 --> 16:55.070
- Yes!
- Been there.

16:55.080 --> 16:58.714
- Ha!
- Nice pair.

16:58.715 --> 17:00.149
- What's their name?
- Quinn.

17:00.150 --> 17:02.902
- What's she like?
- The younger hot one?

17:02.903 --> 17:05.854
- Or the older equally hot one?
- The one in your timeline.

17:05.855 --> 17:09.750
Well, she's headstrong,
focused, and a real leader.

17:09.760 --> 17:12.136
- Do you love her?
- Ohh!

17:12.171 --> 17:13.229
To the max-core.

17:13.230 --> 17:17.099
But I don't think she thinks
very much of me.

17:17.135 --> 17:18.835
Really? You're a catch.

17:18.865 --> 17:20.368
You think I'm a catch?
You ... you think so?

17:20.369 --> 17:24.030
I'm looking at you,
I'm seeing a catch.

17:24.040 --> 17:25.674
All right, it's ready to go.

17:25.675 --> 17:28.310
You sure there isn't anything
else that needs to be done?

17:28.345 --> 17:30.840
Bomb-wise?
Anything else at all?

17:30.875 --> 17:33.814
- That's it. Let's go.
- We could get lunch.

17:33.815 --> 17:36.080
You want to get lunch?

17:39.190 --> 17:42.720
Son.
Grab the plasma torch.

17:46.225 --> 17:48.460
What are you doing?
Dad!

17:48.495 --> 17:50.164
Dad, don't do this without me!

17:50.165 --> 17:53.669
Son, you have your
own time to worry about.

17:55.435 --> 17:58.434
Dad! This ...
This was my idea.

17:58.435 --> 18:00.340
Yeah, but it's my responsibility.

18:00.375 --> 18:04.314
There's another anti-matter bomb
in New York. The one on Earth.

18:04.315 --> 18:07.080
Use it to close
this breach in your time.

18:07.115 --> 18:10.350
You know, I had only
one regret when I left.

18:10.385 --> 18:12.085
Thought I was never
gonna get the chance

18:12.115 --> 18:14.490
to see the man
you would've grown up to be.

18:14.525 --> 18:19.420
Well, now I know he's better
than I would've ever hoped.

18:19.430 --> 18:20.994
Please don't...
Stop. Please.

18:20.995 --> 18:23.760
Stop. Stop. Stop! Stop!

18:23.795 --> 18:27.630
No! Please no!
Stop!

18:31.205 --> 18:34.109
I'm not gonna let you die.
Not again.

18:34.110 --> 18:35.779
I'm gonna come get you!

18:35.780 --> 18:39.710
Make me a promise, son.
Save the Earth.

18:39.745 --> 18:43.250
Nah, you're right.
"Universe" sounds much cooler.

18:43.285 --> 18:47.284
- What if I can't do it?
- Try your best.

18:47.285 --> 18:49.990
What if my best isn't good enough?

18:50.025 --> 18:51.990
It's good enough for me.

19:14.845 --> 19:19.620
- Noooooooo!
- No.

19:21.985 --> 19:23.124
Aaah!

19:23.125 --> 19:25.360
Oh, God!

19:25.395 --> 19:28.630
Aaaah!

19:56.825 --> 19:58.630
Why?

20:00.930 --> 20:04.400
Didn't know we were members
of the same club.

20:04.435 --> 20:07.140
Gary, you still want to do this?

20:09.940 --> 20:13.244
- I'll try my best.
- That's good enough for me.

20:13.245 --> 20:15.350
Wait ... were you watching
me and my dad?

20:15.385 --> 20:17.784
No... No.

20:23.185 --> 20:27.620
- Where are you going?
- They don't need me anymore.

20:39.710 --> 20:43.570
- Should we get up?
- No. We have a little time.

20:43.580 --> 20:47.640
Actually, you don't!
Get off your sass buckets!!

20:50.520 --> 20:53.780
<i>Gary, is Nightfall not coming with us?</i>

20:53.790 --> 20:55.154
No.

20:55.155 --> 20:59.060
<i>You think you know a person, and
then something like this happens.</i>

20:59.095 --> 21:03.330
- What course should I set?
- Earth. Or actually, no, the Universe.

21:03.365 --> 21:05.336
We're gonna save the ...
Well actually,

21:05.371 --> 21:06.234
well, that's doesn't even
make any dang sense.

21:06.235 --> 21:08.060
Okay, just Earth. Earth...

21:08.070 --> 21:11.588
- Earth.
- We've got a bomb to find.
