13:18.041 --> 13:22.041
You need to Google him
because this guy, supposedly,

13:22.041 --> 13:23.166
he was a rabbi-- a holy man.

13:23.166 --> 13:27.458
He would go around,
and he would call Arabs dogs.

13:27.458 --> 13:31.291
And one time, he even said after
27 Palestinians were murdered

13:31.291 --> 13:35.834
in the West Bank, he said,
"The more, the merrier."

13:35.834 --> 13:37.625
Yeah, check that fool out.

13:37.625 --> 13:40.625
K-A-H-A-N-E.

13:40.625 --> 13:42.166
Google him.

13:42.166 --> 13:43.417
Who popped him?

13:43.417 --> 13:46.083
Oh, man, yo, it was this humble
brother from Egypt

13:46.083 --> 13:47.792
by the name of El Sayyid Nosair,

13:47.792 --> 13:49.542
who actually used to hang out

13:49.542 --> 13:51.500
with the blind sheik
in Brooklyn.

13:51.500 --> 13:54.792
So what happened was this dude,
he-- he disguised himself

13:54.792 --> 13:58.667
as an orthodox Jew,
and he came in,

13:58.667 --> 14:01.917
and he shot Kahane in the throat
with a .357 Magnum...

14:01.917 --> 14:06.417
blowing his ass to the floor--
right there.

14:15.500 --> 14:17.542

14:30.959 --> 14:32.250
Only just.

14:32.250 --> 14:35.500
[man] We got our rights
awareness workshop this weekend

14:35.500 --> 14:37.041
at the community center.

14:37.041 --> 14:38.250
I need some help.

14:38.250 --> 14:41.291
Morning, everybody.
Sorry I'm late.

14:41.291 --> 14:43.708
Otto.

14:43.708 --> 14:45.208
Hello, Carrie.

14:45.208 --> 14:46.708
What are you doing here?

14:46.708 --> 14:48.625
Flew in this morning.

14:48.625 --> 14:51.583
The new space
looks great.

14:51.583 --> 14:54.083
Well, welcome.
[chuckles]

14:54.083 --> 14:55.875
-Hi.
-Hi.

14:55.875 --> 14:58.375
Did you meet
Professor Hashem?

14:58.375 --> 15:00.875
I did. He's been briefing me
on your outreach

15:00.875 --> 15:02.834
and counseling programs.

15:02.834 --> 15:03.792
-Impressive.
-What about Fair Trial?

15:03.792 --> 15:05.166
I was just getting to that.

15:05.166 --> 15:07.917
Reda represents
two prisoners at Guantanamo,

15:07.917 --> 15:09.041
and he and his students
are defending five clients

15:09.041 --> 15:11.542
here in New York
on terrorism charges.

15:11.542 --> 15:12.750
I'm assuming a fair trial
isn't what they're getting.

15:12.750 --> 15:15.333
[Reda] If you're male
and Muslim,

15:15.333 --> 15:17.125
the conviction rate
is pushing 90%.

15:17.125 --> 15:19.041
I know a guy who was arrested
for plotting to bring down

15:19.041 --> 15:21.750
the Brooklyn Bridge
with a blowtorch.

15:21.750 --> 15:23.792
He's doing 20 years
in a federal prison--

15:23.792 --> 15:25.166
essentially
for being an idiot.

15:25.166 --> 15:25.959
Okay, okay,
you can stop selling.

15:25.959 --> 15:28.333
I've written
the check already.

15:31.166 --> 15:34.208
Well, don't let me waste
any more of your time.

15:34.208 --> 15:37.250
Professor Hashem.

15:37.250 --> 15:38.208
Mr. Duering.

15:43.875 --> 15:45.583
Can you spare
a few minutes?

15:45.583 --> 15:47.333
Of course.

15:47.333 --> 15:50.500
[man] So Sunday,
we'll need some volunteers.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.792
What's going on?
What's wrong?

16:01.792 --> 16:04.458
Nothing is wrong.
Let's have dinner tonight.

16:04.458 --> 16:07.667
I can't.

16:07.667 --> 16:09.500
-Why not?
-You know why.

16:09.500 --> 16:11.834
Now you won't even
eat a meal with me?

16:11.834 --> 16:14.792
Look, it's the same conversation
over and over again.

16:16.750 --> 16:19.000
Carrie,
what are you doing here?

16:19.000 --> 16:21.417
I'm saying no...

16:21.417 --> 16:25.458
which is what I've been doing
for the past three months.

16:25.458 --> 16:27.875
I mean, here in Brooklyn
with a bunch of kids

16:27.875 --> 16:29.583
and their
associate professor.

16:29.583 --> 16:31.000
Small potatoes.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.667
What?
That's the expression, no?

16:33.667 --> 16:36.041
Small potatoes.

16:36.041 --> 16:37.125
Fuck you, Otto.

16:37.125 --> 16:38.208
I'm serious.

16:38.208 --> 16:40.708
So am I.
It's important work.

16:40.708 --> 16:42.041
Law enforcement needs
to stop harassing

16:42.041 --> 16:44.083
and demonizing
an entire community.

16:44.083 --> 16:46.500
Tens of millions
of war refugees,

16:46.500 --> 16:48.166
more than a billion people
live in extreme poverty.

16:48.166 --> 16:51.291
These are the issues
you should be focusing on.

16:51.291 --> 16:54.375
Well, I'm not.
This is what I'm focusing on.

17:03.834 --> 17:05.750
I've met someone.

17:07.500 --> 17:10.166
What?

17:10.166 --> 17:11.375
Yeah.

17:11.375 --> 17:12.417
What?

17:12.417 --> 17:16.458
Wait, what is this,
some kind of ultimatum?

17:16.458 --> 17:19.291
No, no, I...
I thought you should know.

17:22.417 --> 17:24.458
-You should go.
-Listen, Carrie--

17:24.458 --> 17:25.417
I'm not changing
my mind.

17:25.417 --> 17:28.625
And I'm telling you,
you're making a mistake.

17:28.625 --> 17:30.667
You think
you're better off alone.

17:30.667 --> 17:33.333
You think your sins require it,
but they don't.

17:33.333 --> 17:35.458
You couldn't be
more wrong.

17:44.083 --> 17:46.333
Here.
-I can't accept that.

17:46.333 --> 17:46.375
It's for Franny.

17:48.834 --> 17:50.542

17:50.542 --> 17:51.542
Thank you.

17:51.542 --> 17:54.208
I miss her.

17:54.208 --> 17:57.291
She misses you, too.

17:59.917 --> 18:00.166
Now, go.

18:05.750 --> 18:07.917

18:07.917 --> 18:10.625
It's not.

18:10.625 --> 18:13.041
Let it be someone else.

18:22.458 --> 18:25.333

it's impossible, man,

18:25.333 --> 18:29.166
for a regular human, however--
however fucked up,

-Booger's never been to school,

never went to a movie.

Don't be so rough!
Damn!

19:09.542 --> 19:10.708
You all right, sweetie?

19:10.708 --> 19:13.291
Yeah.

19:13.291 --> 19:13.834
Did you get
your check okay?

19:13.834 --> 19:15.750
I got it right here.

19:15.750 --> 19:17.708

19:17.708 --> 19:19.959
-Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo.
-Give him the seat belt.

19:19.959 --> 19:22.500
He don't need a seat belt,
we're not going far.

19:22.500 --> 19:25.083
Yeah, you can just put my head
right through the...

honey.

19:40.166 --> 19:42.000

towards Iran,

19:42.000 --> 19:44.333
demilitarize the CIA.

19:44.333 --> 19:46.500
What I heard was
a newly elected President

19:46.500 --> 19:48.166
auditioning a bunch
of new ideas.

19:48.166 --> 19:49.959
I don't know, Saul. She gave us
very little love today.

19:49.959 --> 19:52.583
Hmm.
She'll learn to love us.

19:52.583 --> 19:54.250
I'm not sure where
all this rosy optimism

19:54.250 --> 19:57.333
is coming from,
but I don't like it.

19:57.333 --> 19:59.667
Can we order
some food in here?

19:59.667 --> 20:01.041
I'm starving.

20:01.041 --> 20:04.750
It's not just that her ideas
are naive and dangerous.

20:04.750 --> 20:06.125
It's that she didn't
exactly campaign on them.

20:06.125 --> 20:08.667
I'm not sure
the American people

20:08.667 --> 20:10.542
are getting what
they bargained for.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.625
What are you
talking about?

20:12.625 --> 20:14.542
Her son.

20:17.792 --> 20:20.041
Was it Iraq or Afghanistan,
again? I forget.

20:20.041 --> 20:23.458

his third tour there.

20:23.458 --> 20:24.333
Twenty-eight years old.

20:27.875 --> 20:29.250
Poor woman.

20:29.250 --> 20:31.875
You know, she's never spoken
about his death publicly?

20:31.875 --> 20:34.208
Not once.

20:34.208 --> 20:35.959
Not even
at the first debate

20:35.959 --> 20:38.583
when she got hammered
by Hoynes on foreign policy.

20:38.583 --> 20:41.500
Assume you got a theory
about all this?

20:41.500 --> 20:44.250
Well...
developing one.

20:44.250 --> 20:45.500
Tell me.

20:45.500 --> 20:48.458
Nah, you'll just call me
a paranoid fuck.

20:48.458 --> 20:52.041
You're a paranoid fuck.

20:54.041 --> 20:56.667
I think
she despises us, Saul.

20:58.166 --> 21:00.166
I think she blames us
for her boy.

21:01.417 --> 21:06.166
I think she intends
to hold us all accountable.

21:07.166 --> 21:09.000
Yo, so when
do you leave again?

21:09.000 --> 21:11.250
End of next week.

about seeing your old pops.

21:17.875 --> 21:20.375

21:20.375 --> 21:22.667
What do you mean,
it's been, like--

21:22.667 --> 21:24.750
like 14 years or something,
right?

like three jobs back then,

21:28.875 --> 21:29.792

21:29.792 --> 21:32.500
Barely even saw him,
and then he was gone.

I didn't miss having a dad.

-Yeah.

and using the full extent
of the law

37:04.542 --> 37:06.458
to preempt their acts of terror.

37:08.917 --> 37:10.083
Miss Ortiz.

37:10.083 --> 37:12.750
[Ortiz]
Thank you, Agent Conlin.

37:12.750 --> 37:14.542
I'm gonna talk a little bit
about timetables now...

37:14.542 --> 37:17.375
Don't tell me you and Hashem
are defending this asshole.

37:17.375 --> 37:19.834
I'm not sure
he needs a defense.

37:19.834 --> 37:21.250
I'm not sure what he's done
is even illegal.

37:21.250 --> 37:23.792
[scoffs]
You would be mistaken.

37:23.792 --> 37:25.625
Since when is engaging
in religious

37:25.625 --> 37:28.166
and political debate online
a punishable offense?

37:28.166 --> 37:29.917
When its intent is
to motivate people

37:29.917 --> 37:30.834
to attack
the United States.

37:30.834 --> 37:33.667
Intent, wow.
That's a tough one to prove.

37:33.667 --> 37:37.542
What if he's just honestly
opposed to U.S. foreign policy

37:37.542 --> 37:40.208
in Muslim countries,
like I am, more and more?

37:40.208 --> 37:42.500
Do you keep photos
of dead American soldiers

37:42.500 --> 37:43.583
on your laptop?

37:43.583 --> 37:44.875
Or provide links to sites

37:44.875 --> 37:47.208
where you can watch
the latest suicide bomber?

37:47.208 --> 37:49.125
Well, we just met with him,

37:49.125 --> 37:51.959
and what I saw was
an angry kid, at worst.

37:51.959 --> 37:54.333
Oh, he's way past anger,
believe me.

37:54.333 --> 37:57.500
We found plane tickets
to Nigeria in his possession.

37:57.500 --> 37:59.250
Nigeria?

37:59.250 --> 38:01.917
Yep, playground of Boko Haram,
who, by the way,

38:01.917 --> 38:03.250
just pledged allegiance
to the Islamic State.

38:03.250 --> 38:05.625
-Now you're reaching.
-Am I? Really?

38:05.625 --> 38:09.583
There was also five grand
in cash under his mattress.

38:09.583 --> 38:12.917
Now, where does a kid like him
get money like that?

38:12.917 --> 38:16.458
I don't know about you,
but I'm not taking any chances.

38:16.458 --> 38:19.458
Not here.
Not in New York.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.375
[cellphone vibrating]

38:34.583 --> 38:37.708
When he didn't appear for group
at ten o'clock,

38:37.708 --> 38:39.875
a search was conducted,
and you were called

38:39.875 --> 38:41.583
as soon as he was
confirmed missing.

38:41.583 --> 38:42.375
You noticed
he was missing, okay.

38:42.375 --> 38:44.417
But when exactly
did he leave?

38:44.417 --> 38:46.834
He might have left
this morning.

38:46.834 --> 38:49.750
-Could he have left last night?
-Possibly.

38:49.750 --> 38:50.959
Quinn's gone since
you don't know when

38:50.959 --> 38:53.625
and to God knows where, and
you want me to limit my visits?

38:53.625 --> 38:57.166
This isn't a prison,
Miss Mathison. It's a hospital.

38:57.166 --> 38:58.166
And isn't keeping track
of your patients

38:58.166 --> 39:00.500
part of taking care
of them?

39:00.500 --> 39:01.417
Okay.

39:01.417 --> 39:03.542
Clarence said he left Peter
in his room

39:03.542 --> 39:05.125
after your visit yesterday.

39:05.125 --> 39:06.375
As you recall,
he was angry and upset.

39:06.375 --> 39:09.917
He could have snuck out
anytime after that.

39:09.917 --> 39:11.667
And where would
I find Clarence?

39:11.667 --> 39:14.667
In the physical-therapy room,
finishing his shift.

39:41.959 --> 39:42.917
Quinn?

39:42.917 --> 39:46.041
Quinn?!

39:46.041 --> 39:48.000
Quinn!

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
Jesus Christ, get up!

39:49.000 --> 39:50.208
Go away.

39:50.208 --> 39:52.250
Come on, on your feet.

39:52.250 --> 39:53.708
I'm taking you back
to the V.A.

39:53.708 --> 39:56.375
-I'm not going back there.
-No?

39:59.708 --> 40:01.917
I'm fine on my own.

40:01.917 --> 40:02.792
Really?

40:02.792 --> 40:04.375
Well, what are you
planning to do?

40:04.375 --> 40:06.041
Where are you
planning to go?

40:06.041 --> 40:08.834
I don't know.

40:08.834 --> 40:11.000
You can't live
on the street.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.125
I'll figure
something out.

40:17.208 --> 40:20.458
You forgetting
something?

40:20.458 --> 40:22.834
Your pants, shoes.

40:24.667 --> 40:27.000
Well, they gotta be
around here somewhere.

40:27.000 --> 40:31.291
[sighs]

40:54.041 --> 40:55.667
Look, I get it.

40:57.250 --> 40:59.625
Nobody hates hospitals
more than me.

41:00.583 --> 41:02.417
But you gotta help me
out here, Quinn.

41:02.417 --> 41:04.667
I don't know
what else to do.

41:04.667 --> 41:06.667
I can't take care of you
by myself,

41:06.667 --> 41:09.458
and you won't let me put you
into a private program.

41:09.458 --> 41:13.417
So this is what you've got...
for now.

41:18.333 --> 41:21.375
[siren wailing]

41:21.375 --> 41:22.667
I'm sorry.
I wish it was different.

41:37.959 --> 41:39.417
[car door closes]

41:44.333 --> 41:45.667
Listen,
would it be better

41:45.667 --> 41:47.500
if I stopped coming by
for a while?

41:47.500 --> 41:49.417
-Whatever.
-Your treatment team thinks--

41:53.166 --> 41:55.542
[indistinct conversations,
telephones ringing]

42:06.458 --> 42:09.542
I'm gonna say goodbye here,
okay?

42:09.542 --> 42:10.834
Okay?

42:10.834 --> 42:12.125
Yeah, I heard you.
Bye.

42:41.333 --> 42:42.708
[breathing heavily]

42:44.875 --> 42:45.625
[Carrie] Hey, Quinn?

42:45.625 --> 42:47.667
Quinn,
what are you doing?

42:47.667 --> 42:49.542
What are you doing?

42:49.542 --> 42:50.625
I'm leaving.

42:50.625 --> 42:51.834
No.
You're not.

42:51.834 --> 42:54.458
-Yes, I am. I'm leaving.
-No. You can't leave.

42:54.458 --> 42:56.458
Get your hand off of me.
I'm leaving.

42:56.458 --> 42:58.417
You can't leave!
You are not leaving!

42:58.417 --> 43:01.208
Stop! Take your hands off of me!
Take your hands off of me!

43:01.208 --> 43:02.208
You have no right!

43:02.208 --> 43:04.208
Hey, hey!

43:04.208 --> 43:06.291
This is Peter Quinn.
He's a patient here.

43:06.291 --> 43:07.959
This is DeMarco
with lobby security.

43:07.959 --> 43:09.250
We have an agitated,
non-compliant patient--

43:09.250 --> 43:10.417
What's his name, again?

43:10.417 --> 43:12.542
-Peter Quinn.
-Peter Quinn.

43:12.542 --> 43:14.333
Any medical orders
current on him?

43:14.333 --> 43:16.083
[woman] Hold on.
We'll check on that.

43:16.083 --> 43:17.917
[grunting]

43:17.917 --> 43:19.583
Ward seven.

43:19.583 --> 43:21.000
Closed ward on seven
for readmission evaluation.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
No!

43:23.000 --> 43:24.834
[grunts]

43:24.834 --> 43:25.917
Aah!

43:25.917 --> 43:27.500
No, wait!
Stop it!

43:32.250 --> 43:33.875
Frankly,
I'm just as concerned

43:33.875 --> 43:36.500
about her domestic
counterterrorism agenda.

43:36.500 --> 43:38.250
She didn't discuss
any of that with us.

43:38.250 --> 43:39.458
Well, we sat

43:39.458 --> 43:41.667
on the Homeland Security
Committee together,

43:41.667 --> 43:43.166
so I pretty much know
her feelings on the subject.

43:43.166 --> 43:45.291
Which are?

43:45.291 --> 43:48.542
Basically, that we're throwing
away $100 billion a year.

43:48.542 --> 43:50.000
That the threat
is grossly exaggerated.

43:50.000 --> 43:54.125
That Ed Snowden's a hero.
-I don't know about that.

43:54.125 --> 43:55.750
Keeping the country safe
is big business right now.

43:55.750 --> 43:57.959
It's getting bigger.
-Don't you start, Saul.

43:57.959 --> 44:01.291
There's a reason that
we haven't had another 9/11.

44:01.291 --> 44:03.750
It's called vigilance.
-Hey, I'm all for vigilance.

44:03.750 --> 44:05.166
But you know
as well as I do

44:05.166 --> 44:06.625
there are
no coordinated ISIS

44:06.625 --> 44:08.792
or Al-Qaeda networks
here in the United States

44:08.792 --> 44:09.959
like there are
in Europe.

44:09.959 --> 44:11.834
Yeah, because we've been
kicking ass and taking names.

44:11.834 --> 44:16.250
All I'm saying is
she's not entirely wrong.

44:16.250 --> 44:18.792
Where she is wrong,
she's persuadable.

44:18.792 --> 44:23.125
Well, I guess I'll find out
soon enough.

44:23.125 --> 44:25.625
I'm first up
tomorrow morning.

44:25.625 --> 44:26.750
I'm gonna hit the sack.

44:29.625 --> 44:30.500
It's good to see you
again, Saul.

44:30.500 --> 44:32.625
You, too, Senator.

44:32.625 --> 44:33.792
Thanks for the heads-up.

44:38.333 --> 44:41.291
[Carrie] The door to
the garden's through here.

44:41.291 --> 44:43.208
The stove's
on the fritz.

44:43.208 --> 44:45.875
You can use the microwave
in the meantime.

Uh...

44:47.000 --> 44:47.792
Bed's made.

44:50.458 --> 44:52.875
I rent it out -- AirBnB.

44:52.875 --> 44:55.333
How much?
I can pay.

44:55.333 --> 44:58.500
-Quinn, that's not necessary.
-I said I can pay.

44:58.500 --> 44:59.792
Okay.

45:03.667 --> 45:06.166
I live here with Franny.

45:06.166 --> 45:08.625
It's our home --
right upstairs.

45:08.625 --> 45:11.000
So don't bring troubled people
here or do drugs

45:11.000 --> 45:13.041
or behave like you did
last night.

45:13.041 --> 45:16.041
Understood.

45:18.834 --> 45:20.583
The bathroom's there.

45:20.583 --> 45:24.375

on the toilet if it runs.

45:24.375 --> 45:26.917
What is that wallpaper?

45:26.917 --> 45:28.291
There isn't any wallpaper.

45:30.000 --> 45:31.291
Why is it moving?

45:32.834 --> 45:34.583

45:34.583 --> 45:36.708
Uh, I'll call to get
your medication schedule.

45:36.708 --> 45:39.208
I'll get your prescriptions
refilled.

45:39.208 --> 45:41.917
We're also gonna have to
figure out your therapy needs.

45:41.917 --> 45:44.208
There's
an outpatient program.

45:44.208 --> 45:46.708
Anyway...
Tomorrow.

45:46.708 --> 45:49.708
We'll, uh,
we'll make it work.
