00:02.164 --> 00:04.398
Tonight on Kitchen Nightmares...

00:04.398 --> 00:06.998
Chef Ramsay heads
to California's Sushi Ko...

00:06.998 --> 00:10.198
Where the fish isn't
the only thing...

00:10.198 --> 00:11.398
This is a Japanese
health hazard.

00:11.398 --> 00:12.664
That doesn't smell right.

00:12.664 --> 00:14.198
You could kill
somebody.

00:14.198 --> 00:15.398
Blah!

00:15.398 --> 00:18.131
Owner Akira is a broken man...

00:18.131 --> 00:19.498
Talk to me!

00:19.498 --> 00:21.131
A mere shadow of the star chef
he once was.

00:22.698 --> 00:24.164
And that's not all.

00:24.164 --> 00:25.331
This once-proud father...

00:25.331 --> 00:27.498
Has your father given up?

00:27.498 --> 00:29.164
Is dragging his family
down with him.

00:29.164 --> 00:30.000
My family is hanging
by a thread.

00:30.000 --> 00:30.898
My family is hanging
by a thread.

00:30.898 --> 00:32.998
His two grown children
long to see their father

00:32.998 --> 00:34.131
happy again.

00:34.131 --> 00:35.998
I can't remember
the last time I saw him

00:35.998 --> 00:37.498
actually happy.

00:37.498 --> 00:38.964
While the suffering wife Lisa...

00:38.964 --> 00:41.364
Do you think you work
really hard all the time?

00:41.364 --> 00:42.864
Gets more resentful every day.

00:42.864 --> 00:44.998
He doesn't know how to get off
of his little,

00:44.998 --> 00:46.298
skinny ass and work.

00:46.298 --> 00:48.064
Her constant criticism...

00:48.064 --> 00:49.164
Uhh! That's a nightmare.

00:49.164 --> 00:50.364
May just push Akira...

00:50.364 --> 00:51.698
I can't believe it!

00:51.698 --> 00:52.898
And Chef Ramsay...

00:52.898 --> 00:54.031
I need you to shut up.

00:54.031 --> 00:56.031
Over the edge.

00:56.031 --> 00:57.898
I'm not  around.

00:57.898 --> 01:00.000
In one of the most emotional
Kitchen Nightmares ever...

01:00.000 --> 01:01.031
In one of the most emotional
Kitchen Nightmares ever...

01:01.031 --> 01:03.164
I don't think I ever tell you
how much I love you.

01:03.164 --> 01:04.064
It's just hard.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.564
I just want to see you happy.

01:05.564 --> 01:09.131
Chef Ramsay pulls out
all the stops...

01:09.131 --> 01:10.231
You've forgotten
how talented you are.

01:10.231 --> 01:12.331
To not only save
the restaurant...

01:12.331 --> 01:13.464
We need
to bring him back.

01:13.464 --> 01:15.531
But the family as well.

01:15.531 --> 01:18.698
My family is really suffering.

01:39.464 --> 01:41.131
Thousand Oaks, California--

01:41.131 --> 01:44.564
an affluent suburb
outside of Los Angeles.

01:44.564 --> 01:46.664
Akira and Lisa
were a young married couple

01:46.664 --> 01:49.031
when they moved here
more than 20 years ago

01:49.031 --> 01:50.464
from the bay area.

01:50.464 --> 01:52.131
While Lisa raised
their young family,

01:52.131 --> 01:55.131
Akira worked at a popular
and trendy Japanese restaurant

01:55.131 --> 01:57.064
called Sushi Ko

01:57.064 --> 01:59.198
in the wealthy suburb
of Bel-Air.

01:59.198 --> 02:00.000
In the beginning,
I was a sous chef.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.064
In the beginning,
I was a sous chef.

02:02.064 --> 02:04.531
Akira learned the art
of sushi making in Japan.

02:04.531 --> 02:07.664
He was good at his skill,
and so we started working

02:07.664 --> 02:09.464
at Sushi Ko in Bel-Air,

02:09.464 --> 02:11.031
and the restaurant
just took off

02:11.031 --> 02:13.131
and just became
super successful.

02:14.531 --> 02:15.964
My dad was a great chef.

02:15.964 --> 02:18.698
He was so excited
when he was cooking.

02:26.964 --> 02:29.164
We decided it was time
to venture

02:29.164 --> 02:30.000
into our own bigger and better
and nicer Sushi Ko.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.398
into our own bigger and better
and nicer Sushi Ko.

02:33.398 --> 02:35.131
Hello!
Welcome to Sushi Ko!

02:35.131 --> 02:36.564
We decided
to open our restaurant

02:36.564 --> 02:38.364
in this beautiful
shopping center

02:38.364 --> 02:39.664
in Thousand Oaks.

02:39.664 --> 02:43.064
In the beginning,
business was booming.

02:43.064 --> 02:46.698
Then it just slowed down...

02:46.698 --> 02:49.664
Like somebody
put the brakes on.

02:49.664 --> 02:51.031
It's pretty devastating to him.

02:51.031 --> 02:53.964
It broke him.

02:53.964 --> 02:55.798
It's tough, yeah.

02:55.798 --> 02:58.998
Anybody walking around
out there?

02:58.998 --> 03:00.000
Even if there's
nobody in here,

03:00.000 --> 03:00.864
Even if there's
nobody in here,

03:00.864 --> 03:03.964
Akira will scramble
to find somebody

03:03.964 --> 03:05.998
to do a job for him.

03:09.664 --> 03:12.387
And that irritates
the crap out of me.

03:13.297 --> 03:14.331
Most of the time now,

03:14.331 --> 03:17.031
my dad just
kind of walks around.

03:17.031 --> 03:18.197
He doesn't, like,
do anything.

03:18.197 --> 03:19.864
They're gonna
turn off the electric.

03:19.864 --> 03:21.231
You have to pay that one.

03:21.231 --> 03:26.364
We are losing, like,
$15,000 to $20,000 a month.

03:26.364 --> 03:29.664
Credit-card debt
is hundreds of thousands.

03:29.664 --> 03:30.000
We're as deep
as you could ever imagine.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.131
We're as deep
as you could ever imagine.

03:32.131 --> 03:34.864
We still are, like,
$9,000 behind.

03:34.864 --> 03:38.797
Living with financial stress
is pretty bad.

03:38.797 --> 03:40.997
I gave it to them.

03:40.997 --> 03:44.464
My parents are always, like,
fighting and arguing and...

03:44.464 --> 03:46.897
That's a
nightmare.

03:46.897 --> 03:49.564
Never used to be like that.

03:49.564 --> 03:50.797
Over the past four years,

03:50.797 --> 03:52.631
Akira and I
have grown apart.

03:52.631 --> 03:54.131
We work together,
and we live together,

03:54.131 --> 03:55.864
but we don't speak
to each other.

03:55.864 --> 03:57.031
It just isn't worth it.

04:00.131 --> 04:02.397
My dad doesn't spend
enough time with us.

04:02.397 --> 04:03.797
He's just less approachable.

04:03.797 --> 04:05.797
Dad.
How many did you order?
Just one?

04:05.797 --> 04:08.364
I don't really ever
talk to him anymore, and...

04:08.364 --> 04:09.964
Dad!

04:11.331 --> 04:13.197
Akira's spirits
are broken down,

04:13.197 --> 04:16.331
And he just doesn't know
what to do anymore.

04:16.331 --> 04:19.897
Life has been like hell
since we opened the restaurant.

04:19.897 --> 04:21.964
If Sushi Ko closed tomorrow,

04:21.964 --> 04:23.297
I think we could lose
everything--

04:23.297 --> 04:24.864
our house, restaurant,

04:24.864 --> 04:27.031
and our hope
and our dreams.

04:27.031 --> 04:30.000
I can't remember the last time
I slept through a night,

04:30.000 --> 04:30.897
I can't remember the last time
I slept through a night,

04:30.897 --> 04:34.464
just always worried
about what's gonna happen next.

04:34.464 --> 04:36.731
Chef Ramsay's our last hope.

04:40.231 --> 04:41.531
Hello.

04:41.531 --> 04:42.797
Hi, welcome
to Sushi Ko.

04:42.797 --> 04:44.064
How are you?
I'm Lisa.

04:44.064 --> 04:45.231
Lisa, nice to see you,
my darling.

04:45.231 --> 04:46.864
And...
Akira.

04:46.864 --> 04:48.297
Akira.
What's the connection?

04:48.297 --> 04:49.464
Business partners?

04:49.464 --> 04:50.631
27 years.

04:51.964 --> 04:53.197
Oh, you're married
to each other?

04:53.197 --> 04:55.997
Yes.
And you're the chef?

04:59.697 --> 05:00.000
Okay.
And, Lisa, you run the...

05:00.000 --> 05:01.564
Okay.
And, Lisa, you run the...

05:01.564 --> 05:02.964
I'm kind of
the front-of-the-house lady,

05:02.964 --> 05:04.297
greet the guests...
Right.

05:04.297 --> 05:05.897
Serve tables,
if needed.

05:05.897 --> 05:07.997
What is the problem
with Sushi Ko?

05:09.997 --> 05:11.131
Clearly
there's no guests.

05:11.131 --> 05:13.697
But what's the problem...

05:13.697 --> 05:15.731
The main problem?
Which I do not know.

05:15.731 --> 05:17.631
You know, we stand
in the window and do this,

05:17.631 --> 05:18.964
trying to get people
to come in.

05:18.964 --> 05:19.964
You lift up the--
Hey, come on in!

05:19.964 --> 05:20.997
Lift up the blinds?

05:20.997 --> 05:22.731
Does that--
We're here, whoo!

05:23.831 --> 05:26.364
And that--that hasn't
worked around here?

05:30.997 --> 05:33.164
So tell me
about Sushi Ko.

05:34.797 --> 05:36.031
So then you bought out
the other partners

05:36.031 --> 05:37.064
and bought the name?

05:37.064 --> 05:38.664
Pretty much so, yes.

05:38.664 --> 05:40.297
And they decided
to sort of move Sushi Ko

05:40.297 --> 05:42.197
from Bel-Air to your
hometown here in Thousand Oaks?

05:42.197 --> 05:43.897
Exactly.
So how long ago
did it open here?

05:43.897 --> 05:45.897
Four years.

05:45.897 --> 05:47.897
Um, I can't do anything
unless I find out

05:47.897 --> 05:48.964
what the problems are.

05:48.964 --> 05:50.664
So...I'd like to eat.

05:50.664 --> 05:52.364
What would
you recommend? Um...

05:55.864 --> 05:56.864
A what?

06:00.064 --> 06:01.297
Japanese pizza?

06:02.297 --> 06:04.497
I don't--
I don't like it.

06:04.497 --> 06:06.364
Wow.

06:06.364 --> 06:08.864
I'm not a big fan
of any of our food.

06:08.864 --> 06:11.031
There's just, like,
no flavor anymore,

06:11.031 --> 06:14.197
because Akira is not involved
enough in the kitchen.

06:14.197 --> 06:15.331
Okay.

06:15.331 --> 06:16.364
Why don't we sit down
and have lunch?

06:16.364 --> 06:17.464
I'll look forward
to catching up

06:17.464 --> 06:18.964
with both of you
after lunch, thank you.

06:18.964 --> 06:20.864
Enjoy.
Lovely, thank you.

06:20.864 --> 06:22.664
Come on in.

06:25.997 --> 06:30.000
Some strange fixtures
on the wall.

06:30.000 --> 06:30.197
Some strange fixtures
on the wall.

06:30.197 --> 06:31.897
Are you ready?
Yes, please.

06:31.897 --> 06:33.064
Okay.
Thank you.

06:33.064 --> 06:34.897
Uh, right.

06:34.897 --> 06:36.797
Let's start
with a little bowl of miso.

06:36.797 --> 06:39.464
Okay.
And Akira mentioned
the sushi pizza.

06:39.464 --> 06:41.064
He recommended that?
Yeah.

06:41.064 --> 06:42.364
I wouldn't recommend it.

06:42.364 --> 06:44.064
No?
No.

06:44.064 --> 06:45.997
I would not recommend
the sushi pizza

06:45.997 --> 06:47.664
to anybody.

06:47.664 --> 06:48.964
Uh, I think it's vile.

06:48.964 --> 06:50.797
Gotta try
the sushi pizza.

06:50.797 --> 06:52.797
Just out of curiosity.

06:52.797 --> 06:54.831
Good luck.
Plea--"Good luck."

06:54.831 --> 06:56.164
Um, the green tower--
that sounds nice.

06:56.164 --> 06:58.331
And then
let's end up with...

06:58.331 --> 07:00.000
A little bit
of the salmon sashimi.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.464
A little bit
of the salmon sashimi.

07:01.464 --> 07:02.897
I think
that'll be enough.

07:02.897 --> 07:04.797
You've got some of the best
and some of the worst.

07:04.797 --> 07:06.697
Thank you.
Thank you.

07:06.697 --> 07:09.031
Good. Excellent.

07:09.031 --> 07:11.231
Some of the best
and some of the worst.

07:11.231 --> 07:13.197
No one's afraid
to show their opinion here.

07:18.231 --> 07:19.464
Well, here you are.

07:19.464 --> 07:21.897
Your soup.
Thank you.

07:21.897 --> 07:22.897
Here we go.

07:26.797 --> 07:28.831
Miso soup
doesn't taste very fresh.

07:28.831 --> 07:30.000
It's not actually
very hot either.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.564
It's not actually
very hot either.

07:35.464 --> 07:36.964
Thank you.
Chef, your green tower.

07:36.964 --> 07:38.131
Thank you.

07:38.131 --> 07:39.464
It's very salty, though,
isn't it?

07:39.464 --> 07:41.164
It is.
Yeah.
Is that normal?

07:41.164 --> 07:43.531
Yeah, that's normal.

07:43.531 --> 07:45.531
Thank you.
Thank you.

07:47.131 --> 07:48.231
What is that?

07:52.797 --> 07:54.031
Someone's gray hair.

07:54.031 --> 07:57.364
Ohh....

07:57.364 --> 07:58.964
Um...

07:58.964 --> 08:00.000
Are you finished
with the green tower?

08:00.000 --> 08:00.364
Are you finished
with the green tower?

08:00.364 --> 08:01.797
Oh, there's just--

08:01.797 --> 08:04.164
I pulled out
this disgusting hair.

08:04.164 --> 08:06.364
Ee. Yeah, I'm definitely
finished with that.

08:06.364 --> 08:07.531
Oh, sorry.

08:07.531 --> 08:09.831
I just wanted to...

08:09.831 --> 08:11.031
Just die,
bury my head in the sand

08:11.031 --> 08:12.064
when that happened.

08:12.064 --> 08:14.197
Um...guys.

08:14.197 --> 08:17.697
There's...a hair

08:17.697 --> 08:18.897
in the green tower.

08:18.897 --> 08:19.831
You gotta be
kidding me.

08:22.164 --> 08:23.531
It's always,
like, a running joke.

08:23.531 --> 08:24.664
Like, "Oh, my God,

08:24.664 --> 08:26.331
there's a lot of things
going wrong."

08:26.331 --> 08:28.364
So Akira disappears.

08:28.364 --> 08:30.000
Your sashimi.

08:30.000 --> 08:30.631
Your sashimi.

08:30.631 --> 08:32.164
Thank you.
You're welcome.

08:32.164 --> 08:33.797
Lovely.
And is the salmon fresh?

08:33.797 --> 08:35.531
Yes, it is.

08:35.531 --> 08:36.897
Thank you.

08:36.897 --> 08:38.531
John...

08:41.664 --> 08:42.664
Frozen.

08:49.631 --> 08:52.831
It just tastes
like it's frozen.

08:52.831 --> 08:54.631
How is your sashimi?

08:54.631 --> 08:56.964
That's definitely frozen.
It's very, very chewy.

08:56.964 --> 08:58.731
My mistake.
I was just informed.

08:58.731 --> 09:00.000
They are frozen.
They tasted frozen.

09:00.000 --> 09:00.531
They are frozen.
They tasted frozen.

09:00.531 --> 09:02.531
Is that normally...
The way--

09:02.531 --> 09:03.731
they freeze all the fish?

09:03.731 --> 09:04.897
I guess we get lazy
with our food.

09:06.864 --> 09:08.697
Sushi pizza.

09:08.697 --> 09:09.897
Yeah.

09:09.897 --> 09:11.631
I've never been
to a Japanese restaurant

09:11.631 --> 09:14.664
where I can have a pizza,
sushi-style,

09:14.664 --> 09:18.131
and a chef-owner
that's no longer in the kitchen.

09:18.131 --> 09:20.031
I'm nervous.

09:20.031 --> 09:21.131
Just go with it.

09:21.131 --> 09:22.631
Okay.

09:22.631 --> 09:25.364
Um...that's
the sushi pizza?

09:25.364 --> 09:26.464
It sure is.

09:26.464 --> 09:29.131
It's rice, salmon, crab,

09:29.131 --> 09:30.000
and mayonnaise, some cheese.
Wow.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.131
and mayonnaise, some cheese.
Wow.

09:31.131 --> 09:32.797
Thank you, love.

09:32.797 --> 09:34.697
Japanese pizza.

09:40.831 --> 09:42.164
Sorry.

09:42.164 --> 09:45.064
That...

09:45.064 --> 09:49.031
is rancid.

09:49.031 --> 09:50.831
You were right.

09:50.831 --> 09:53.464
That is an insult
to pizza, yeah?

09:53.464 --> 09:54.697
And Japanese food.

09:54.697 --> 09:55.997
Chef had fair warning

09:55.997 --> 09:57.297
that it was gonna
be terrible.

09:58.964 --> 10:00.000
I told him not to get it.

10:00.000 --> 10:00.631
I told him not to get it.

10:00.631 --> 10:02.064
Where's the chef?

10:02.064 --> 10:04.364
The old Sushi Ko

10:04.364 --> 10:07.364
always stood for the finest
in Japanese food.

10:07.364 --> 10:08.797
But today's
disappointing lunch

10:08.797 --> 10:11.964
proved to Gordon that
the only thing this Sushi Ko

10:11.964 --> 10:14.964
has in common with
the former one is the name.

10:14.964 --> 10:17.497
Did you know there's
a hair in the crab?

10:17.497 --> 10:20.131
No? No one told you?

10:20.131 --> 10:21.964
Are they wearing
hats back here?

10:21.964 --> 10:24.197
You're askingme?
Yeah, I'm...

10:25.631 --> 10:26.864
Are you guys wearing hats
for service?

10:26.864 --> 10:28.164
Uh, no, sir.

10:28.164 --> 10:29.797
Nothing at all?
No.

10:29.797 --> 10:30.000
If you're telling them
what to do,

10:30.000 --> 10:31.797
If you're telling them
what to do,

10:31.797 --> 10:33.164
why can't they
wear a hat?

10:35.231 --> 10:36.564
Oh,.

10:36.564 --> 10:37.997
Let's go back
to the beginning.

10:37.997 --> 10:39.797
When was
the miso soup made?

10:39.797 --> 10:40.831
It was made yesterday.
Yesterday.

10:40.831 --> 10:43.064
And just tell me,
why was the taste salty?

10:43.064 --> 10:45.631
It's probably been sitting
in there reducing overnight.

10:45.631 --> 10:46.797
What do you mean
"reducing overnight"?

10:46.797 --> 10:48.864
You keep stuff
in the banbury overnight?

10:48.864 --> 10:50.564
Correct.

10:50.564 --> 10:52.231
What?

10:52.231 --> 10:55.497
The sushi pizza
was a  joke.

10:55.497 --> 10:56.897
- Right.
- Okay.

10:56.897 --> 10:58.664
Hideous, disgusting,

10:58.664 --> 11:00.000
and an insult
to Japanese culture

11:00.000 --> 11:01.164
and an insult
to Japanese culture

11:01.164 --> 11:03.964
and an insult
to a  pizza house.

11:05.997 --> 11:07.864
You don't need me
to come in here and tell you

11:07.864 --> 11:10.864
you look  stupid
selling a sushi pizza

11:10.864 --> 11:13.197
that tastes like gunk!

11:14.731 --> 11:16.831
What were you doing
serving frozen fish to me

11:16.831 --> 11:17.997
at lunchtime?

11:17.997 --> 11:21.131
I would like to order
proper, fresh fish,

11:21.131 --> 11:24.031
and it doesn't
actually happen.

11:24.031 --> 11:25.464
I've never known
a Japanese restaurant

11:25.464 --> 11:27.564
to freeze so much stuff.

11:27.564 --> 11:30.000
I'm not here
to make you look stupid.

11:30.000 --> 11:30.997
I'm not here
to make you look stupid.

11:30.997 --> 11:33.231
But I can smell
Okay.

11:33.231 --> 11:35.331
Can you say something?

11:35.331 --> 11:37.997
Seriously.
Talk to me.

11:37.997 --> 11:40.031
Talk to me.

11:45.397 --> 11:47.164
Coming up...

11:47.164 --> 11:48.897
This is a Japanese
health hazard.

11:48.897 --> 11:50.297
A shocking inspection...

11:50.297 --> 11:52.397
You could kill
somebody.

11:52.397 --> 11:55.297
Has Gordon wondering
if Akira and Sushi Ko

11:55.297 --> 11:56.697
can be saved.

11:56.697 --> 11:57.697
Has your father given up?

11:57.697 --> 11:58.864
Then...

11:58.864 --> 12:00.000
My family is hanging
by a thread.

12:00.000 --> 12:00.697
My family is hanging
by a thread.

12:00.697 --> 12:02.364
It's a Kitchen Nightmares
intervention.

12:02.364 --> 12:03.731
We need
to bring him back.

12:03.731 --> 12:05.364
As Chef Ramsay
works with Lisa...

12:05.364 --> 12:07.831
I want to be
more emotionally supportive.

12:07.831 --> 12:08.897
Sammy...

12:08.897 --> 12:10.231
I want to do as much as I can.
It's just hard.

12:10.231 --> 12:11.664
And Hana...

12:11.664 --> 12:12.997
I don't think I ever
tell you how much I love you.

12:12.997 --> 12:15.031
To get Akira back on track.

12:15.031 --> 12:17.064
My family's
really suffering.

12:17.064 --> 12:19.131
You don't want to miss
what's coming up

12:19.131 --> 12:21.331
on Kitchen Nightmares.

12:32.381 --> 12:34.947
After getting very little
out of Akira,

12:34.947 --> 12:37.881
Chef Ramsay decides to sit down
with the owners' children,

12:37.881 --> 12:41.214
22-year-old Sammy
and 20-year-old Hana.

12:41.214 --> 12:44.214
Was it always the plan
to have both of you

12:44.214 --> 12:46.781
so involved from day one?

12:46.781 --> 12:47.947
It was an idea
for us to come help

12:47.947 --> 12:50.381
and give them a break
if they needed to.

12:50.381 --> 12:51.381
But not to be here...

12:51.381 --> 12:53.047
every weekend.
24-7.

12:53.047 --> 12:54.577
I, most of the time,
don't even want to be here,

12:54.577 --> 12:55.847
I, most of the time,
don't even want to be here,

12:55.847 --> 12:57.381
'cause I'm here so much.

12:57.381 --> 12:58.847
But gotta do
what you gotta do...

12:58.847 --> 13:00.847
Yeah.
To help out
the family, so...

13:00.847 --> 13:02.947
And here's my worry,
honestly.

13:02.947 --> 13:05.381
It's the level of shortcuts
that are currently going on

13:05.381 --> 13:07.381
in this restaurant.
right.

13:07.381 --> 13:08.914
Has your father given up?

13:08.914 --> 13:11.081
Yeah, I think he definitely
has on the inside,

13:11.081 --> 13:12.181
but he doesn't
want to show it.

13:12.181 --> 13:15.847
Do you ever tell him
to just stop,

13:15.847 --> 13:17.381
take stock,

13:17.381 --> 13:19.281
rethink?

13:19.281 --> 13:21.014
He doesn't really listen.

13:23.347 --> 13:24.577
Please don't get upset.

13:24.577 --> 13:24.614
Please don't get upset.

13:24.614 --> 13:26.114
I'm sorry, I just--
No, no, come on.

13:26.114 --> 13:28.447
I--you know.
I know, I know.

13:28.447 --> 13:30.014
It's hard for me
to think about.
I know it is, darling.

13:30.014 --> 13:31.247
I totally get it.

13:31.247 --> 13:32.947
I'm almost 21.

13:32.947 --> 13:35.381
I should be
living my own life, but...

13:36.847 --> 13:40.247
I can't, because I have
to help out my family,

13:40.247 --> 13:42.014
and I can't leave them.

13:42.014 --> 13:44.347
You're both
incredibly committed,

13:44.347 --> 13:47.381
and I, you know, totally
respect that level of loyalty.

13:47.381 --> 13:49.747
What I'm more nervous about
than anything

13:49.747 --> 13:51.114
is the state
of the business.

13:51.114 --> 13:52.281
Where do you see
the business?

13:52.281 --> 13:54.214
Pretty much
as far down as you can go.

13:54.214 --> 13:54.577
I've also recently,
like, in the past year,

13:54.577 --> 13:55.947
I've also recently,
like, in the past year,

13:55.947 --> 13:57.181
given money also.

13:58.681 --> 14:01.114
And is it mum
that comes and asks or--

14:01.114 --> 14:02.114
It was my dad that asked.

14:02.114 --> 14:04.281
So initially,
I gave $10,000,

14:04.281 --> 14:07.347
and then half a year ago,
he asked for $5,000.

14:07.347 --> 14:08.347
And I was like,
"Of course," you know?

14:08.347 --> 14:10.114
How?

14:10.114 --> 14:11.181
Um, from working
my photography,

14:11.181 --> 14:12.781
my own personal income.

14:12.781 --> 14:14.881
If your family's
asking you for help,

14:14.881 --> 14:15.947
I would help them
right away.

14:15.947 --> 14:19.414
I have probably given
my parents

14:19.414 --> 14:21.881
above $20,000--

14:21.881 --> 14:23.947
a decent chunk of change...

14:23.947 --> 14:24.577
for a 22-year-old,
I think.

14:24.577 --> 14:25.781
for a 22-year-old,
I think.

14:25.781 --> 14:29.681
There's a level of...
unfairness,

14:29.681 --> 14:32.047
because you've both
been dragged into this

14:32.047 --> 14:34.047
through no choice
of your own.

14:34.047 --> 14:35.881
You've got my help.

14:35.881 --> 14:38.847
I'm supporting
every one of you.

14:38.847 --> 14:42.381
My family is hanging
by a thread.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.781
There's only so much
I can do.

14:50.214 --> 14:53.347
In the short time that Gordon
has been at Sushi Ko,

14:53.347 --> 14:54.577
he has not only learned that
the restaurant is in shambles,

14:54.577 --> 14:56.047
he has not only learned that
the restaurant is in shambles,

14:56.047 --> 14:57.881
but that this once
tight-knit family

14:57.881 --> 14:59.747
is suffering badly.

15:02.047 --> 15:03.781
Hi, welcome to Sushi Ko.

15:03.781 --> 15:05.414
I'll take you back
to your table.

15:08.247 --> 15:10.447
Enjoy your dinner, guys.

15:10.447 --> 15:11.947
What can I get for you?

15:11.947 --> 15:14.347
Spicy tuna
rice cake okay?

15:15.714 --> 15:17.247
Okay.

15:17.247 --> 15:19.414
Bust it out, man.

15:19.414 --> 15:22.114
Why do all these sticks
got burns on them?

15:22.114 --> 15:24.514
Y-you don't buy them
like that, do you?

15:24.514 --> 15:24.577
Why are they burnt?

15:24.577 --> 15:27.714
Why are they burnt?

15:27.714 --> 15:29.714
You what?

15:32.247 --> 15:34.281
I can't believe
this is happening.

15:39.114 --> 15:40.381
Where's Lisa?

15:40.381 --> 15:43.347
No, Akira, don't run away
like a snake.

15:43.347 --> 15:44.681
Okay.

15:44.681 --> 15:46.281
I've just scraped
dried chicken off these.

15:46.281 --> 15:47.514
We're cutting our costs.

15:47.514 --> 15:49.381
There's bits of food
on there.

15:49.381 --> 15:50.247
Do you think this is right?

15:50.247 --> 15:52.781
Um...

15:52.781 --> 15:54.514
Just feel how sticky
that is on the end.

15:54.514 --> 15:54.577
That's food
being wiped off it.

15:54.577 --> 15:58.047
That's food
being wiped off it.

15:58.047 --> 16:01.214
It's 45 minutes into service,

16:01.214 --> 16:03.047
And Sushi Ko is doing what,
unfortunately,

16:03.047 --> 16:04.714
it does best--

16:04.714 --> 16:06.581
disappointing its customers.

16:11.347 --> 16:14.447
Okay, guys, they say
they don't like the tempura.

16:14.447 --> 16:15.581
They said
it's way overcooked

16:15.581 --> 16:17.414
and that that is
just really doughy.

16:17.414 --> 16:19.281
Thank you.

16:24.747 --> 16:25.781
Lisa...

16:25.781 --> 16:27.181
It's coming back.

16:27.181 --> 16:28.081
It's doughy and...

16:28.081 --> 16:30.247
That's not
tempura broccoli.

16:30.247 --> 16:31.181
It's mushy, yeah.

16:31.181 --> 16:32.747
Blah!

16:35.247 --> 16:37.314
Stop the broccoli.
Take it off.

16:37.314 --> 16:39.814
Yeah, don't even, like,
do tempura anymore.

16:39.814 --> 16:41.414
Why cause more damage?

16:43.914 --> 16:44.981
Is that fryer hot enough?

16:44.981 --> 16:46.781
Does it work properly,
the fryer--temperature?

16:46.781 --> 16:48.247
Actually,
that's a great question.

16:48.247 --> 16:49.414
It doesn't look
like it's hot enough.

16:49.414 --> 16:51.781
It's not blasting it.
No.

16:51.781 --> 16:53.181
Uh, that's scary.

16:53.181 --> 16:54.577
That's a nightmare
piece of equipment

16:54.577 --> 16:55.947
That's a nightmare
piece of equipment

16:55.947 --> 16:57.181
that probably isn't
holding the temperature

16:57.181 --> 16:58.781
'cause it's getting old...

16:58.781 --> 17:01.147
Just like me.

17:01.147 --> 17:02.247
Uh, Lisa, here.

17:02.247 --> 17:04.181
Look at all this.
Oh, the spicy mayo.

17:04.181 --> 17:06.514
So you don't keep
mayonnaise in the fridge?
No.

17:10.114 --> 17:11.947
What?

17:11.947 --> 17:15.114
"Refrigerate
after opening."

17:15.114 --> 17:16.314
Feel how warm that is.

17:16.314 --> 17:19.181
And how long has that
been staying outside for?

17:19.181 --> 17:21.947
Truthfully?

17:21.947 --> 17:24.281
For four years?
Yes.

17:24.281 --> 17:24.577
This is a Japanese
health hazard.

17:24.577 --> 17:27.081
This is a Japanese
health hazard.

17:27.081 --> 17:28.114
This is about you

17:28.114 --> 17:30.147
running your restaurant
properly.

17:30.147 --> 17:31.114
And you're not.

17:33.181 --> 17:35.147
Oh, my God.
What's this fridge for?

17:36.681 --> 17:38.114
It's warm in here.

17:38.114 --> 17:39.647
This fridge is on 50.

17:39.647 --> 17:41.947
This--is this working,
this fridge?

17:43.814 --> 17:45.147
When did it break down?

17:49.447 --> 17:51.947
So we've got
big containers of ice...

17:51.947 --> 17:52.947
Yes.

17:52.947 --> 17:54.577
To keep
the ingredients cold?

17:54.577 --> 17:54.847
To keep
the ingredients cold?

17:56.647 --> 17:58.147
Vegetable?
We got dairy.

17:58.147 --> 18:00.681
You've got eggs here.

18:00.681 --> 18:02.747
Never chicken, beef here?
Look at me.

18:05.247 --> 18:07.447
Why are you lying to me?

18:07.447 --> 18:10.114
Akira, you could kill
somebody.

18:19.692 --> 18:22.625
Bad food, a family in ruins,

18:22.625 --> 18:24.158
and unsanitary conditions...

18:24.158 --> 18:26.625
You could kill
somebody.

18:26.625 --> 18:28.825
It's been quite a first day.

18:28.825 --> 18:30.058
And as dinner service ends...

18:30.058 --> 18:31.392
Thank you.

18:31.392 --> 18:33.058
Chef Ramsay realizes

18:33.058 --> 18:37.025
That Sushi Ko is in much worse
shape than he thought.

18:37.025 --> 18:40.525
Right...
How was that for you?

18:40.525 --> 18:42.125
I think our kitchen

18:42.125 --> 18:43.693
could have run
a little smoother.

18:43.693 --> 18:45.025
could have run
a little smoother.

18:45.025 --> 18:48.225
I don't think you're taking it
seriously enough.

18:48.225 --> 18:51.492
The rice, the soup,
the fridge,

18:51.492 --> 18:52.958
the broccoli.

18:54.525 --> 18:55.558
Talk to me.

18:55.558 --> 18:56.992
I think that

18:56.992 --> 19:00.892
Akira, you know,
could do a lot more.

19:00.892 --> 19:02.158
There's so many

19:02.158 --> 19:04.158
bad practices,

19:04.158 --> 19:07.392
and you don't seem
to give a.

19:07.392 --> 19:10.158
Have you given up?

19:10.158 --> 19:11.558
I think he's given up.

19:13.992 --> 19:17.025
How many of your customers
would order kushiyaki

19:17.025 --> 19:19.492
if they knew they were
eating it or feeling it

19:19.492 --> 19:23.458
off of wooden sticks that have
been used three weeks ago?

19:23.458 --> 19:25.558
None of them.

19:28.892 --> 19:31.558
It's almost like
you're a man in denial.

19:33.025 --> 19:34.792
Anything to say or...?

19:35.992 --> 19:37.625
He doesn't know
how to fix it, though.

19:37.625 --> 19:40.392
He opened this place
on the assumption

19:40.392 --> 19:41.958
that he was the delegator.

19:41.958 --> 19:43.058
He's lost.

19:43.058 --> 19:43.693
I think
that the restaurant's

19:43.693 --> 19:44.958
I think
that the restaurant's

19:44.958 --> 19:45.958
burnt him out.

19:45.958 --> 19:47.058
He thought that

19:47.058 --> 19:48.858
we were gonna be
living la vida loca,

19:48.858 --> 19:50.125
and when the business

19:50.125 --> 19:51.058
didn't go the way
it was supposed to,

19:51.058 --> 19:52.492
he didn't know what to do.

19:52.492 --> 19:54.725
But you don't really think

19:54.725 --> 19:57.125
that you're lazy, right?
you think you work--

19:57.125 --> 19:58.692
do you think you work
really hard all the time?

19:58.692 --> 20:00.025
I said, "I think
you should go cook."

20:00.025 --> 20:01.025
You go, "I don't want
to cook anymore."

20:01.025 --> 20:02.792
That's the way Akira feels.

20:02.792 --> 20:05.358
"If I can pay you to do it,
why should I do it?"

20:05.358 --> 20:06.658
But you're
not really paying them.

20:06.658 --> 20:08.025
Your kids
are paying them.

20:08.025 --> 20:10.825
He doesn't know how to get
off of his little skinny ass

20:10.825 --> 20:12.358
and really getting
to work.

20:12.358 --> 20:13.693
Right, I want you--

20:13.693 --> 20:13.892
Right, I want you--

20:13.892 --> 20:15.992
I-I need you to shut up
for two minutes,

20:15.992 --> 20:18.625
and I need you to talk.

20:18.625 --> 20:20.225
This is part of the reason

20:20.225 --> 20:22.358
why you've lost your voice.

20:22.358 --> 20:24.692
Not only is your wife
wearing the trousers,

20:24.692 --> 20:27.192
but she's speaking
for you.

20:27.192 --> 20:29.192
What is it?

20:29.192 --> 20:30.225
Talk to me.

20:38.658 --> 20:39.992
Come on.

20:41.325 --> 20:43.058
Talk to me.

20:46.025 --> 20:47.625
Come on, Akira.

20:47.625 --> 20:48.858
Me.

20:50.958 --> 20:54.792
I'm angry that Akira's
lost his ability

20:54.792 --> 20:56.025
to communicate
with people.

20:56.025 --> 20:59.058
And it was good
to get it out.

21:01.392 --> 21:03.458
Akira, once a proud chef,

21:03.458 --> 21:05.292
Has lost his way.

21:05.292 --> 21:06.558
And unfortunately,

21:06.558 --> 21:08.725
his family is being dragged
down with him.

21:08.725 --> 21:11.025
Chef Ramsay knows that
in order for this restaurant

21:11.025 --> 21:13.025
to have any chance
of surviving,

21:13.025 --> 21:13.693
he must find a way
to bring them together.

21:13.693 --> 21:16.058
he must find a way
to bring them together.

21:25.858 --> 21:27.958
Tough day yesterday,
uh, really tough.

21:27.958 --> 21:29.025
I'm outside
the family home now,

21:29.025 --> 21:31.792
and it's clear that Akira
is a broken man,

21:31.792 --> 21:33.558
and in order to get
this restaurant fixed,

21:33.558 --> 21:35.125
I need the old Akira back.

21:35.125 --> 21:38.058
So I can't do that
without the family's help.

21:41.492 --> 21:43.693
I just wanted to talk

21:43.693 --> 21:43.958
I just wanted to talk

21:43.958 --> 21:48.158
to all three of you,
um, about Akira.

21:48.158 --> 21:49.725
He's a broken man,

21:49.725 --> 21:51.725
a man with a tremendous weight
on his shoulders.

21:51.725 --> 21:56.025
This is a man that is not
just on the edge.

21:56.025 --> 21:57.125
The whole family's
involved in this.

21:57.125 --> 21:59.125
You can feel the divide,

21:59.125 --> 22:00.925
just in terms
of the friction

22:00.925 --> 22:02.992
that's built between you.

22:02.992 --> 22:04.292
Every day, every second.

22:04.292 --> 22:08.292
Take me back
when you first met.

22:08.292 --> 22:11.992
Um, he was really
funny and cute.

22:11.992 --> 22:13.458
He had a lot of energy,

22:13.458 --> 22:13.693
and he used to think
of goofy things to say,

22:13.693 --> 22:15.658
and he used to think
of goofy things to say,

22:15.658 --> 22:18.025
even though he didn't speak
English very well and...

22:19.158 --> 22:21.992
He never smiles anymore now.

22:21.992 --> 22:24.058
So sad.
Yeah, it's so sad.

22:24.058 --> 22:25.992
Dad is just kind of

22:25.992 --> 22:27.558
away from everybody,
I think.

22:27.558 --> 22:29.125
He's removed now.

22:29.125 --> 22:32.025
He's not like a part
of the family, really.

22:32.025 --> 22:34.192
It's just always
just me and the kids,

22:34.192 --> 22:35.525
and he's just gone.

22:35.525 --> 22:36.958
He'll just, like, stand
and just stare,

22:36.958 --> 22:38.392
'cause he doesn't know
what to do.

22:38.392 --> 22:40.158
He's...
He's lost.

22:40.158 --> 22:41.725
I miss, like...

22:41.725 --> 22:43.693
When he was just smiling
when I walked in the door,

22:43.693 --> 22:44.058
When he was just smiling
when I walked in the door,

22:44.058 --> 22:45.125
you know?

22:45.125 --> 22:46.358
We need
to bring him back.

22:46.358 --> 22:47.958
If that restaurant's
got any chance

22:47.958 --> 22:49.958
of really, seriously
turning around,

22:49.958 --> 22:52.025
it can't be done
without him.

22:52.025 --> 22:53.192
No, I know that.

22:53.192 --> 22:54.392
I agree.
We can't do it
without him.

22:54.392 --> 22:55.958
He's the heartbeat.

22:55.958 --> 22:57.392
I need each
and every one of you

22:57.392 --> 23:01.025
to give him a--phuh!
A lift,

23:01.025 --> 23:04.958
in a way that his
self-esteem rises,

23:04.958 --> 23:07.125
the confidence
starts to shine,

23:07.125 --> 23:09.858
and more importantly,
we start to get him back.

23:13.058 --> 23:13.693
I think my dad,
he's checked out.

23:13.693 --> 23:16.025
I think my dad,
he's checked out.

23:16.025 --> 23:19.125
I can't remember the last time
I saw him, like...

23:19.125 --> 23:21.058
Actually happy,

23:21.058 --> 23:24.192
like, waking up happy,
going to bed happy.

23:24.192 --> 23:29.058
I wish he could come back
and make it all right.

23:34.458 --> 23:36.658
Where have you been,
on the lake?

23:36.658 --> 23:38.892
Sit down.

23:38.892 --> 23:42.658
Yeah, I know. Well, "A,"
I wanted to--I wanted to come

23:42.658 --> 23:43.693
and, uh, see
where it all started.

23:43.693 --> 23:44.125
and, uh, see
where it all started.

23:44.125 --> 23:48.725
There's a level of distance
that we've grown apart.

23:48.725 --> 23:50.158
We need
to narrow the gap.

23:50.158 --> 23:52.225
Sammy, you go first.

23:52.225 --> 23:54.125
What inspires you most
about dad?

23:54.125 --> 23:57.025
Working up
from dishwasher to...

23:57.025 --> 23:58.525
Restaurant owner.

23:58.525 --> 23:59.858
He's always the one
that tells me

23:59.858 --> 24:01.125
to get it right
the first time.

24:01.125 --> 24:03.125
I learned all my hard work
from him, so...

24:03.125 --> 24:04.958
Yeah, it's just tough,
you know.

24:04.958 --> 24:08.058
Like, I want to do
as much as I can.

24:08.058 --> 24:09.225
It's just hard.

24:14.058 --> 24:15.525
Okay?

24:17.558 --> 24:18.725
I believe him.

24:18.725 --> 24:20.125
Thank you, Sammy.

24:21.392 --> 24:23.125
Hana...

24:23.125 --> 24:26.692
If there was one thing
that you would want to say

24:26.692 --> 24:29.325
that you've never had
the chance to do

24:29.325 --> 24:30.958
over the last
four years,

24:30.958 --> 24:32.125
what would it be?

24:32.125 --> 24:34.825
I don't think
I ever tell you

24:34.825 --> 24:36.025
How much I love you.

24:36.025 --> 24:38.392
I, like--I say
I love you, but...

24:38.392 --> 24:40.458
I never really
express it.

24:47.658 --> 24:50.225
I just want
to see you happy.

25:01.925 --> 25:05.958
I want to try to be
more emotionally supportive.

25:05.958 --> 25:07.625
We want to support you,

25:07.625 --> 25:09.792
and we want to do
everything we can.

25:09.792 --> 25:11.892
It would be a dream
just to...

25:11.892 --> 25:13.692
be our old selves again.

25:13.692 --> 25:13.693
Let's pretend that we...

25:13.693 --> 25:15.725
Let's pretend that we...

25:15.725 --> 25:17.125
We're starting out,

25:17.125 --> 25:19.125
and, like, let's try to find
each other again

25:19.125 --> 25:20.392
and be friends.

25:28.158 --> 25:30.858
Today we are
gonna start it fresh.

25:30.858 --> 25:32.192
We wipe the slate clean.

25:32.192 --> 25:34.625
We start the day
with a family hug.

25:34.625 --> 25:36.158
Group hug!
Yes?

25:48.658 --> 25:49.858
Coming up...

25:49.858 --> 25:51.992
Chef Ramsay puts his plan
for Sushi Ko

25:51.992 --> 25:53.458
into effect.

25:53.458 --> 25:55.525
Tonight
is a comeback service.

25:55.525 --> 25:57.325
But Lisa is not supportive.

25:57.325 --> 25:59.458
I still don't think
he's working very hard.

25:59.458 --> 26:01.058
It's clear the restaurant

26:01.058 --> 26:02.458
is not the only thing
that's on the line.

26:02.458 --> 26:03.558
Akira-san!

26:03.558 --> 26:04.858
So is their marriage.

26:04.858 --> 26:06.825
Cut him some slack.

26:06.825 --> 26:09.958
The wounds run deep,
and no one is backing down...

26:09.958 --> 26:11.792
- Bang!
- Not Lisa...

26:11.792 --> 26:13.125
I'm not gonna
take all the blame.

26:13.125 --> 26:13.693
And not Akira.

26:13.693 --> 26:14.658
And not Akira.

26:14.658 --> 26:15.992
I can't believe this!

26:24.804 --> 26:27.969
The emotional family meeting
really touched Chef Ramsay,

26:27.969 --> 26:30.469
and he made arrangements
to give Akira and the restaurant

26:30.469 --> 26:32.503
some much-needed help.
Hello!

26:32.503 --> 26:34.503
I decided that this family

26:34.503 --> 26:37.836
needs a little lift,
a little leg up.

26:37.836 --> 26:39.303
I've never been
to any Japanese restaurant

26:39.303 --> 26:41.169
and seen a fridge
with a block of ice in there

26:41.169 --> 26:42.703
that broke down
four months ago.

26:42.703 --> 26:43.969
So I made a few phone calls

26:43.969 --> 26:45.569
and managed
to get hold

26:45.569 --> 26:48.303
of seven brand-new

26:48.303 --> 26:49.778
counter traulsen
refrigeration units.

26:49.778 --> 26:51.503
counter traulsen
refrigeration units.

26:51.503 --> 26:53.736
Top of the line, yeah.
Come here and have a look.

26:53.736 --> 26:57.136
Come round.
Yeah, that's right.

26:57.136 --> 26:58.869
Yeah, trust me.
Number one.

26:58.869 --> 27:00.369
Come round.

27:00.369 --> 27:02.236
Look, come round, Lisa.

27:02.236 --> 27:03.636
Open them up.

27:03.636 --> 27:06.836
He's smiling.

27:06.836 --> 27:08.903
The fridges, to me,
are amazing.

27:08.903 --> 27:11.569
They're beautiful.
They're great.

27:11.569 --> 27:14.636
But to see Akira's face
when he heard out about it

27:14.636 --> 27:16.369
was the best,

27:16.369 --> 27:18.403
because that's the only time
I've seen him smile

27:18.403 --> 27:19.469
in four years.

27:19.469 --> 27:19.778
I didn't stop there.

27:19.778 --> 27:21.403
I didn't stop there.

27:21.403 --> 27:22.836
Come with me.

27:22.836 --> 27:23.903
Yes.

27:23.903 --> 27:25.136
Have a look at

27:25.136 --> 27:27.903
two stunning
Vulcan deep fat fryers.

27:27.903 --> 27:29.169
Oh, my God!

27:29.169 --> 27:30.836
That's so amazing.

27:30.836 --> 27:32.069
The most amazing

27:32.069 --> 27:35.869
eight-ring gas burner.

27:37.669 --> 27:40.169
The most amazing
walk-in freezer.

27:40.169 --> 27:42.336
Temperature is visual.

27:42.336 --> 27:43.369
No more ice bucket.

27:51.403 --> 27:53.003
Now we have no excuses.

27:53.003 --> 27:54.736
Great.

27:54.736 --> 27:59.336
New equipment is just part
of Chef Ramsay's plan.

27:59.336 --> 28:01.336
He knows there's
another critical change

28:01.336 --> 28:03.369
that has to be made
at Sushi Ko.

28:03.369 --> 28:06.336
It's an asset they should
have taken advantage of

28:06.336 --> 28:07.469
a long time ago.

28:07.469 --> 28:09.469
Tonight
you're gonna cook.

28:09.469 --> 28:11.169
Okay.
It's a comeback service.

28:11.169 --> 28:12.503
Okay.
Okay?

28:12.503 --> 28:15.369
But I want you to grab it
and run with it.

28:15.369 --> 28:16.703
All right.
How you feeling?

28:19.069 --> 28:19.778
Excellent.

28:19.778 --> 28:20.636
Excellent.

28:24.636 --> 28:26.636
Okay.

28:26.636 --> 28:27.969
Good.

28:27.969 --> 28:29.503
Akira, today's gonna help

28:29.503 --> 28:31.636
oversee tonight's launch
of the sushi bar.

28:31.636 --> 28:32.703
Okay?

28:32.703 --> 28:34.336
Please, welcome
the man himself back.

28:34.336 --> 28:36.036
Look at you!

28:36.036 --> 28:37.569
You little pocket rocket.

28:37.569 --> 28:39.369
Look at you!

28:39.369 --> 28:41.403
Whoo-hoo!
Welcome back!

28:41.403 --> 28:42.736
Yes!

28:42.736 --> 28:44.536
Seeing my dad
in his chef's suit

28:44.536 --> 28:46.403
was really exciting.

28:46.403 --> 28:48.236
The sushi bar
is where my dad belongs.

28:48.236 --> 28:49.469
It's where he started off,

28:49.469 --> 28:49.778
and he was
a great chef before.

28:49.778 --> 28:51.203
and he was
a great chef before.

28:51.203 --> 28:53.736
And he's getting back in it,
so that's great.

28:53.736 --> 28:55.703
Okay, Lisa,
open the door.

28:59.036 --> 29:00.236
Hello.
Welcome to Sushi Ko.

29:00.236 --> 29:01.336
It's gonna be you two?

29:01.336 --> 29:02.269
For dinner service,

29:02.269 --> 29:04.569
Not only will they be
serving fresh fish,

29:04.569 --> 29:08.036
Chef Ramsay prepares with Akira
two new salmon dishes

29:08.036 --> 29:10.203
that will be featured
on tonight's menu.

29:12.069 --> 29:13.669
Are you folks
ready to order?

29:15.203 --> 29:16.336
We'll try
the Sushi Ko crunch.

29:16.336 --> 29:18.703
Okay.

29:31.469 --> 29:33.136
All right.

29:39.736 --> 29:42.403
I don't think Akira's
taking it seriously.

29:42.403 --> 29:44.669
Even though we are starting
to see a glimpse

29:44.669 --> 29:48.503
of the old Akira
shining behind the sushi bar...

29:48.503 --> 29:49.778
Chef Ramsay notices
that his wife Lisa

29:49.778 --> 29:51.403
Chef Ramsay notices
that his wife Lisa

29:51.403 --> 29:53.169
is not supporting him.

29:55.736 --> 29:58.336
Have some food for you guys
right here.

29:58.336 --> 29:59.736
It's excellent.
It's good.

29:59.736 --> 30:01.303
I like it.

30:01.303 --> 30:04.303
I still don't think
he's working very hard.

30:04.303 --> 30:07.703
Okay, yeah.

30:07.703 --> 30:10.136
Okay, thanks for
double-checking on everything.

30:10.136 --> 30:11.536
Is he working hard?
I don't think so.

30:11.536 --> 30:13.336
He's still just
walking around.

30:13.336 --> 30:16.503
I'm worried that Akira's
not gonna ever be the chef

30:16.503 --> 30:17.703
That he should be.

30:19.469 --> 30:19.778
I don't think he'll really
follow through with it.

30:19.778 --> 30:22.403
I don't think he'll really
follow through with it.

30:22.403 --> 30:23.369
All right.

30:23.369 --> 30:25.903
Here's some share plates
and soy dishes.

30:25.903 --> 30:27.403
Wasn't there supposed
to be avocado in it?

30:27.403 --> 30:29.303
Yeah, did they put
avocado? No?

30:29.303 --> 30:31.036
They didn't.

30:31.036 --> 30:32.803
Okay, I'll be right back.

30:32.803 --> 30:34.536
Lisa, these are wrong.

30:34.536 --> 30:37.069
Eel roll is supposed
to have avocado in it.

30:37.069 --> 30:38.169
Okay.

30:38.169 --> 30:39.303
And this is supposed to be
a Hawaiian roll

30:39.303 --> 30:41.003
with the shrimp
on top instead,

30:41.003 --> 30:42.869
but it's
a California roll.

30:42.869 --> 30:44.169
That's a nightmare.

30:44.169 --> 30:46.503
Akira-san!

30:46.503 --> 30:48.869
The eel roll's supposed
to have avocado inside,

30:48.869 --> 30:49.778
and that needs
Hawaiian sauce.

30:49.778 --> 30:50.203
and that needs
Hawaiian sauce.

30:50.203 --> 30:52.369
Okay, all right.
Ugh! Really
pisses me off.

30:52.369 --> 30:54.636
Lisa's really tough
with Akira.

30:54.636 --> 30:57.569
When she gets going,
just get out of the way.

30:57.569 --> 30:58.569
It's like a tornado.

31:07.003 --> 31:08.403
No, 205 is me.

31:18.403 --> 31:19.778
Thank you.

31:19.778 --> 31:20.069
Thank you.

31:20.069 --> 31:22.169
And the roll.

31:22.169 --> 31:24.336
Yay!
Thank you!

31:24.336 --> 31:26.903
I'm so glad to have Akira
back behind the bar.

31:26.903 --> 31:29.669
It makes everything go
so much smoother.

31:29.669 --> 31:32.036
Done, done,
done, done, done.

31:32.036 --> 31:33.069
This is incredible.

31:33.069 --> 31:34.303
With Akira standing
behind the bar,

31:34.303 --> 31:36.236
dressed as a chef,
running his restaurant,

31:36.236 --> 31:37.869
already there's a completely
different feel

31:37.869 --> 31:39.836
to last night's service.

31:47.469 --> 31:49.469
Watching my dad
working the kitchen

31:49.469 --> 31:49.778
and smiling
almost the whole time,

31:49.778 --> 31:51.503
and smiling
almost the whole time,

31:51.503 --> 31:53.836
it was just a great feeling.

31:53.836 --> 31:55.836
Thank you.

31:55.836 --> 31:57.969
Everything's getting better.

31:57.969 --> 31:59.869
As dinner service
comes to an end,

31:59.869 --> 32:03.003
It's clear that Sushi Ko
has a long way to go.

32:03.003 --> 32:04.503
But the new equipment,

32:04.503 --> 32:06.136
Akira's new attitude,

32:06.136 --> 32:07.969
and a couple of new dishes

32:07.969 --> 32:10.636
have Chef Ramsay feeling better
about its chances.

32:10.636 --> 32:12.303
First of all,

32:12.303 --> 32:14.336
Let me be really blunt,
uh, with you.

32:14.336 --> 32:17.036
And something you--
you need to hear.

32:17.036 --> 32:18.569
Okay.
Yeah?

32:18.569 --> 32:19.778
Honestly...
Yes?

32:19.778 --> 32:20.536
Honestly...
Yes?

32:20.536 --> 32:22.969
Tonight you were
a different man.

32:24.703 --> 32:26.803
The change
is night and day.

32:28.369 --> 32:30.069
Not only did you
look good,

32:30.069 --> 32:32.336
but you seemed
to look like

32:32.336 --> 32:34.636
you were enjoying
what you were doing.

32:34.636 --> 32:37.336
I've got total respect
for you today.

32:37.336 --> 32:38.403
Good job.
Thanks.

32:38.403 --> 32:41.036
I need a quick chat
with your wife.

32:48.236 --> 32:49.778
Now, he may have changed,

32:49.778 --> 32:51.236
Now, he may have changed,

32:51.236 --> 32:55.136
but unfortunately,
you haven't.

32:55.136 --> 32:58.703
The difference in that man
in 24 hours

32:58.703 --> 33:00.636
is night and day.

33:00.636 --> 33:03.136
And not once tonight

33:03.136 --> 33:06.403
did you mention
anything to him.

33:06.403 --> 33:07.703
And you can't be
that  cold.

33:07.703 --> 33:11.002
You're acting
like a block of ice.

33:11.002 --> 33:12.902
He's not your head chef.

33:12.902 --> 33:13.969
He's your husband.

33:13.969 --> 33:14.969
Yeah.

33:14.969 --> 33:16.202
And here's the thing.

33:16.202 --> 33:17.969
You're tough.
You've been through a lot.

33:17.969 --> 33:19.778
And over the last
four or five years,

33:19.778 --> 33:20.003
And over the last
four or five years,

33:20.003 --> 33:21.970
you've become stronger
than he has.

33:21.970 --> 33:23.836
Coming from the outside in,

33:23.836 --> 33:26.070
it's so evident.

33:26.070 --> 33:28.870
You're ,
bang, bang, bang.

33:28.870 --> 33:31.303
Back off.

33:31.303 --> 33:33.170
I'm not  around.

33:33.170 --> 33:35.203
I'm not gonna take
all the blame,

33:35.203 --> 33:38.803
But I agree
that I am a bitch to Akira

33:38.803 --> 33:41.903
and I'm--I agree that
it's not a good way to be.

33:41.903 --> 33:43.703
I think,
between you and I,

33:43.703 --> 33:46.203
that man needs you
more than ever before.

33:46.203 --> 33:47.836
Oh, totally, yeah.

33:47.836 --> 33:49.336
What you need to do

33:49.336 --> 33:49.778
is cut him some slack,

33:49.778 --> 33:51.136
is cut him some slack,

33:51.136 --> 33:54.803
not just for him,
but for the family's sake...

33:54.803 --> 33:56.070
before it's too late.

34:05.652 --> 34:08.252
After Chef Ramsay's
conversation with Lisa...

34:08.252 --> 34:10.352
That man needs you
more than ever before.

34:10.352 --> 34:12.752
And with Akira's
commitment to change...

34:14.352 --> 34:16.352
Gordon and his team
went ahead

34:16.352 --> 34:20.319
with a much-needed makeover
of Sushi Ko.

34:20.319 --> 34:22.352
Chef Ramsay!
Good morning.

34:22.352 --> 34:25.319
Look at you two holding hands
and cuddling as well.

34:25.319 --> 34:27.986
Chef Ramsay pleaded with me

34:27.986 --> 34:29.986
to embrace Akira
and try to give him

34:29.986 --> 34:30.939
the support he needs.

34:30.939 --> 34:31.152
the support he needs.

34:31.152 --> 34:33.552
So this is a really
crucial point in our lives.

34:33.552 --> 34:35.352
It's like
being reborn again.

34:35.352 --> 34:38.052
Okay, today we're relaunching
the new Sushi Ko.

34:38.052 --> 34:40.686
So we have to bring Sushi Ko
into the modern era.

34:40.686 --> 34:43.419
The decor has to stand out
as something

34:43.419 --> 34:44.686
not just cutting edge,

34:44.686 --> 34:47.052
but fresh
with a wonderful appeal.

34:47.052 --> 34:48.086
Are you ready?

34:48.086 --> 34:49.886
Yeah.
Yeah? Let's go.

34:49.886 --> 34:51.386
Let's go, baby.
Let's go.

34:51.386 --> 34:52.819
Come in!

34:54.319 --> 34:55.219
Look at that.

34:55.219 --> 34:56.686
Oh, my God!

34:56.686 --> 34:58.186
Contemporary,

34:58.186 --> 34:59.519
And it's got that
really fresh appeal to it.

34:59.519 --> 35:00.939
Oh, my God.
Oh, I'm shaking!

35:00.939 --> 35:03.086
Oh, my God.
Oh, I'm shaking!

35:03.086 --> 35:05.086
Good-bye, samurai warrior.

35:05.086 --> 35:06.752
The minute you step
in this door,

35:06.752 --> 35:09.319
great colors,
it's fresh and modern.

35:17.586 --> 35:19.186
Oh, my God!

35:19.186 --> 35:21.219
When I first arrived,

35:21.219 --> 35:22.586
It was like sitting
inside a prison.

35:22.586 --> 35:24.386
Now it's beautiful.
Look at the color.

35:24.386 --> 35:26.386
Dark, moody red.

35:26.386 --> 35:27.752
That's my picture!

35:27.752 --> 35:29.019
Ohh!

35:29.019 --> 35:30.939
You have a serious artist
in the family,

35:30.939 --> 35:31.086
You have a serious artist
in the family,

35:31.086 --> 35:33.152
but no one's ever,
ever shown him off.

35:33.152 --> 35:35.352
They're cool,
they're sophisticated.

35:35.352 --> 35:36.486
Lisa, are you happy?

35:36.486 --> 35:38.252
I'm...So happy.

35:38.252 --> 35:39.852
It's just amazing.

35:39.852 --> 35:43.152
The color is just perfect.

35:43.152 --> 35:44.919
Group hug!
Group hug.

35:44.919 --> 35:46.252
Hey, sexy, come over here.

35:46.252 --> 35:47.486
Akira,
go in the middle.

35:47.486 --> 35:49.919
Whoo!
Everybody hug Akira!

35:49.919 --> 35:53.219
Chef Ramsay is bringing us
together as a family.

35:53.219 --> 35:55.485
My parents are, like,

35:55.485 --> 35:57.852
more happy than I've seen them
in forever.

35:57.852 --> 35:59.819
It's awesome.

35:59.819 --> 36:00.939
He's a new man.

36:00.939 --> 36:01.919
He's a new man.

36:01.919 --> 36:05.319
He's smiling.
Yay!

36:06.985 --> 36:08.885
After revamping Sushi Ko

36:08.885 --> 36:12.152
into a stylish, contemporary
Japanese restaurant,

36:12.152 --> 36:13.719
Chef Ramsay
moves on to the menu...

36:13.719 --> 36:15.085
Welcome to the new food!

36:15.085 --> 36:16.985
Whoa!
Have a look.

36:16.985 --> 36:19.852
By modernizing
the traditional sushi dishes.

36:19.852 --> 36:21.585
Albacore tartare
with avocado,

36:21.585 --> 36:24.185
crispy salmon cake,
seared tuna with a salsa,

36:24.185 --> 36:25.719
uh, japanese-style
curried mussels,

36:25.719 --> 36:26.885
teriyaki chicken.

36:26.885 --> 36:29.319
The rolls,
we've got the fire roll--

36:29.319 --> 36:30.939
clean, modern,
great execution.

36:30.939 --> 36:31.985
clean, modern,
great execution.

36:31.985 --> 36:34.985
Okay, so...

36:41.819 --> 36:45.052
Word of the relaunch has spread
through the community,

36:45.052 --> 36:47.252
and Chef Ramsay
has surprised the owners

36:47.252 --> 36:48.752
with traditional
taiko drummers

36:48.752 --> 36:51.085
to officially
kick off the evening.

36:52.752 --> 36:53.852
Amazing.

37:11.919 --> 37:13.219
All right!

37:13.219 --> 37:15.252
- Thank you.
- Oh, my God.

37:15.252 --> 37:17.719
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
thank you so much for coming.

37:17.719 --> 37:20.685
Akira, the official
welcoming and the opening

37:20.685 --> 37:22.219
of this restaurant.

37:23.352 --> 37:24.985
Excellent.

37:33.219 --> 37:36.052
Hello.
Welcome to Sushi Ko.

37:39.419 --> 37:41.919
As the first orders make
their way into the kitchen...

37:41.919 --> 37:45.319
You make sure--
back him up, okay?

37:45.319 --> 37:47.719
An energized Akira
pumps up the cooks

37:47.719 --> 37:49.152
for the big night.

37:49.152 --> 37:51.485
Help each other.
Talk to each other, okay?

37:51.485 --> 37:53.019
Sure.
All right.

37:53.019 --> 37:54.985
First one of the night.

37:54.985 --> 37:58.185
Sushi Ko crunch.
Let's bust one out.

37:58.185 --> 37:59.819
They just got two more.

38:02.952 --> 38:04.385
Lettuce wrap
in the window.

38:04.385 --> 38:06.919
Okay, give it to me.

38:12.152 --> 38:13.752
The yellowtail roll.

38:13.752 --> 38:16.185
Akira, at his rightful
place in the kitchen,

38:16.185 --> 38:17.385
pushes the first orders out.

38:17.385 --> 38:19.552
Oh, my gosh,
that's really good.

38:19.552 --> 38:21.985
And customers are satisfied

38:21.985 --> 38:23.585
with what the new Sushi Ko
has to offer.

38:23.585 --> 38:24.985
The beef
is very tender.

38:24.985 --> 38:27.885
But soon after,
old habits return,

38:27.885 --> 38:30.419
and Akira
is doing everything

38:30.419 --> 38:30.939
except what he needs
to do most--cook.

38:30.939 --> 38:32.852
except what he needs
to do most--cook.

38:35.519 --> 38:36.919
Thank you.

38:36.919 --> 38:39.085
All right,
thank you very much.

38:39.085 --> 38:41.152
I've been waiting for a special
for a half an hour.

38:41.152 --> 38:43.552
Lisa, the food's
hanging around

38:43.552 --> 38:44.585
too long in the window.

38:44.585 --> 38:45.719
Okay.

38:45.719 --> 38:47.252
Without a leader,

38:47.252 --> 38:48.352
the kitchen
is falling behind.

38:48.352 --> 38:49.885
It's dying
in the window.

38:49.885 --> 38:51.985
And the impact
is starting to be felt

38:51.985 --> 38:55.085
in the dining room.

38:55.085 --> 38:56.519
No.

38:56.519 --> 38:58.185
There's more tickets there.

38:58.185 --> 39:00.719
Earlier tonight,
Akira was doing really well

39:00.719 --> 39:00.939
Behind the sushi bar,

39:00.939 --> 39:02.152
Behind the sushi bar,

39:02.152 --> 39:04.252
but now he's falling back
into his old ways already.

39:04.252 --> 39:05.985
He's out bussing tables,

39:05.985 --> 39:07.552
and he's not paying attention
to what's happening.

39:07.552 --> 39:10.019
We need him to be
back behind the bar again.

39:10.019 --> 39:13.719
What are you doing
carrying that thing?

39:13.719 --> 39:15.752
"They need the help."

39:15.752 --> 39:17.752
All right.

39:19.585 --> 39:20.519
Honestly, I'm worried.

39:20.519 --> 39:23.319
You went back
to your old ways.

39:23.319 --> 39:25.752
You didn't cook anything.

39:25.752 --> 39:27.552
You bussed tables,
you served food.

39:27.552 --> 39:28.852
You delegated.

39:28.852 --> 39:30.939
Why weren't you cooking?
Why weren't you...

39:30.939 --> 39:31.919
Why weren't you cooking?
Why weren't you...

39:31.919 --> 39:34.019
Can you not do it?

39:34.019 --> 39:35.685
You're not
a  manager.

39:35.685 --> 39:37.152
You're not a busboy.

39:37.152 --> 39:38.485
You're the chef.

39:38.485 --> 39:39.718
Come on.

39:48.452 --> 39:50.819
Finally, towards
the end of dinner service,

39:50.819 --> 39:52.485
Akira took
Chef Ramsay's advice...

39:52.485 --> 39:53.819
Okay.

39:53.819 --> 39:56.119
And jumped back into cooking
in the kitchen.

39:56.119 --> 39:57.619
210.
Yeah, thank you.

39:57.619 --> 39:58.685
But, for the most part,

39:58.685 --> 40:01.019
it was his staff
who pulled together

40:01.019 --> 40:03.552
and made tonight's relaunch
a success.

40:03.552 --> 40:04.785
Thank you!

40:07.052 --> 40:08.452
The good news
about tonight

40:08.452 --> 40:09.852
is the customers
loved the food.

40:09.852 --> 40:11.152
Yeah.
Yes?

40:11.152 --> 40:13.285
This restaurant
took a huge leap forward...

40:13.285 --> 40:14.519
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

40:14.519 --> 40:15.049
In terms of spreading
the message out there.

40:15.049 --> 40:15.885
In terms of spreading
the message out there.

40:15.885 --> 40:17.619
But I just want to know
what you're gonna do.

40:17.619 --> 40:20.352
What's gonna happen
when I'm gone?

40:24.319 --> 40:26.652
You are a talented man!

40:26.652 --> 40:28.852
You've just forgotten
how talented you are.

40:28.852 --> 40:32.485
What are you talented for,
picking up  plates?

40:32.485 --> 40:34.285
No.
Why are you
a talented man?

40:34.285 --> 40:35.785
Cooking.
That's right.

40:35.785 --> 40:37.985
So if you're gonna
dress the part,

40:37.985 --> 40:39.019
look the part,

40:39.019 --> 40:41.352
cook your socks off.
you got it.

40:47.519 --> 40:49.719
If I catch
your skinny little ass

40:49.719 --> 40:52.652
that side of the table,
I swear to God...

40:52.652 --> 40:56.519
But, Lisa, you've got
to support each other.

40:56.519 --> 40:57.852
I came in, I first arrived,
the whole family,

40:57.852 --> 40:59.685
not just the restaurant,
was just fragmented--

40:59.685 --> 41:02.652
four different individuals
seeking different ambitions

41:02.652 --> 41:03.619
with different attitudes,

41:03.619 --> 41:05.785
and no one singing
off the same page.

41:05.785 --> 41:08.619
But there's a reconnect
that's taken place.

41:08.619 --> 41:11.452
There's a level of clarity,
proper understanding,

41:11.452 --> 41:14.285
and we all know
what we've got to do.

41:19.019 --> 41:20.985
Please.

41:20.985 --> 41:24.652
Having Chef Ramsay
come into our lives is...

41:24.652 --> 41:26.019
It's meant the world.

41:26.019 --> 41:28.285
Yeah, we have to start over,

41:28.285 --> 41:30.219
and I'm nervous as

41:30.219 --> 41:32.952
that it's not
gonna go smoothly.

41:32.952 --> 41:36.385
And I just am thankful
for this new chance.

41:36.385 --> 41:38.485
Take care.
Thank you.

41:38.485 --> 41:39.652
Yes.
Good night.

41:39.652 --> 41:40.685
Thank you so much.

41:40.685 --> 41:42.019
Arigato.
Domo arigato.

41:42.019 --> 41:44.485
Thank you.
Been an absolute
pleasure.

41:44.485 --> 41:45.049
All right, give me a hug.

41:45.049 --> 41:46.119
All right, give me a hug.

41:46.119 --> 41:47.519
They never hug
in Japan.

41:47.519 --> 41:49.552
He's gonna
pick you up.

41:49.552 --> 41:51.319
Okay.

41:52.852 --> 41:54.119
Bye.

41:59.152 --> 42:00.885
It was really cool
to see my parents

42:00.885 --> 42:03.419
Give each other
kisses and stuff.

42:03.419 --> 42:05.352
I haven't seen that
in a while.

42:05.352 --> 42:06.352
Group hug.

42:06.352 --> 42:07.619
Working with each other

42:07.619 --> 42:09.619
and supporting each other,

42:09.619 --> 42:11.652
it's gonna give us more hope
than we had before.

42:14.952 --> 42:15.049
What a week.
We made a lot of changes.

42:15.049 --> 42:17.052
What a week.
We made a lot of changes.

42:17.052 --> 42:19.285
We changed the equipment,
we changed the menu,

42:19.285 --> 42:20.685
and we changed the decor.

42:20.685 --> 42:22.185
But what this family
failed to realize

42:22.185 --> 42:23.619
is that their greatest asset

42:23.619 --> 42:25.819
was something I could
never have given them,

42:25.819 --> 42:27.285
because it was themselves.

42:27.285 --> 42:31.319
And it's that that will
make this place successful.

42:31.319 --> 42:32.885
Whew, what a week.

42:32.885 --> 42:35.452
Sayonara, Thousand Oaks.

42:38.719 --> 42:40.719
In the days that followed,

42:40.719 --> 42:43.152
Sushi Ko
saw a boost in business,

42:43.152 --> 42:45.049
and Lisa and Akira were working
as a team once again.

42:45.049 --> 42:46.185
and Lisa and Akira were working
as a team once again.

42:48.052 --> 42:49.619
Yeah, let's clean
this space up here.

42:49.619 --> 42:51.519
Recently, they decided

42:51.519 --> 42:53.652
that in order
to maximize profits,

42:53.652 --> 42:55.452
they would search out
a new location

42:55.452 --> 42:57.119
where the rents
weren't as high.

43:00.185 --> 43:02.185
Regardless of the location,

43:02.185 --> 43:04.418
the most valuable lesson
this family may have learned

43:04.418 --> 43:06.452
was not how to run
their business,

43:06.452 --> 43:10.332
but how to appreciate
each other.
