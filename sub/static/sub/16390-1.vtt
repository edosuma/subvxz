00:37.207 --> 00:38.925
JESSICA: How are the numbers?

00:39.767 --> 00:41.086
MARTIN: Incredible.

00:42.007 --> 00:45.477
(CHUCKLES) Absolutely incredible.

00:48.047 --> 00:49.605
Congratulations.

00:51.447 --> 00:53.005
I'm leaving you.

00:56.887 --> 00:58.923
Did you hear what I said?

00:59.247 --> 01:00.839
I'm leaving you.

01:01.047 --> 01:03.277
Yeah, I heard. Yeah. Yeah.

01:06.007 --> 01:08.202
- I'm not kidding.
- I know.

01:12.247 --> 01:15.557
Look, I think
it's an excellent decision on your part.

01:16.607 --> 01:17.801
You do?

01:17.967 --> 01:21.004
You're a fantastic person,

01:22.967 --> 01:25.561
and the last year's been great, really.

01:26.487 --> 01:28.125
You're beautiful.

01:28.767 --> 01:30.564
The sex has been wonderful.

01:30.647 --> 01:32.763
You're kind and supportive.

01:33.087 --> 01:36.477
You wait for me with dinner
when I work late, you're amazing.

01:36.567 --> 01:39.877
And it's driving me out of my fucking mind!

01:43.407 --> 01:44.476
You know, with numbers like this,

01:44.567 --> 01:46.046
this should be the happiest day of my life,

01:46.127 --> 01:50.200
and instead I have to worry about
whether I make you happy all the time!

01:53.447 --> 01:55.165
Jessica, sweetheart,

01:57.327 --> 02:00.160
you make me feel like being a better person.

02:00.247 --> 02:02.283
And I'm not a better person.

02:03.847 --> 02:05.075
I'm me.

02:07.847 --> 02:09.598
I feel sorry for you.

02:14.887 --> 02:16.161
Don't.

02:16.967 --> 02:18.639
I certainly don't.

02:22.087 --> 02:24.362
In fact, I envy myself deeply.

03:32.847 --> 03:34.565
- Morning.
- AGENT: Morning.

03:38.447 --> 03:40.199
Good morning, Mr President.

03:40.287 --> 03:42.243
And congratulations.

03:42.327 --> 03:44.966
It's good to have you with us
for another four years.

03:45.047 --> 03:47.686
Thank you, Thomas. It's good to be back.

03:48.527 --> 03:51.280
Would you like me to turn on the TV, sir?

03:53.327 --> 03:55.921
Oh, no. That's okay.

03:57.327 --> 03:59.045
STATON: Hey, I'll tell you what.

03:59.487 --> 04:02.001
- How about the paper?
- The paper, sir?

04:02.207 --> 04:04.437
Yeah. What the heck?

04:04.847 --> 04:08.317
We'll see what the New York Times
has to say about things.

04:08.687 --> 04:11.121
Bet they're eating some crow this morning.

04:11.207 --> 04:13.084
We have a copy anywhere?

04:13.167 --> 04:14.600
We can get one, sir.

04:14.687 --> 04:18.043
All right, get one.
And scare up my reading glasses.

04:19.487 --> 04:21.762
I'm going to read the newspaper.

04:22.167 --> 04:24.237
Shall I bring it to the workout room, sir?

04:24.327 --> 04:27.603
No, I'm gonna read my paper
right here in bed.

04:27.847 --> 04:29.724
Take it a little easy this morning.

04:29.807 --> 04:31.763
Well, you deserve it, sir.

04:31.847 --> 04:34.520
Yes, I do. It was a heck of a fight.

04:34.847 --> 04:36.724
Yes, sir, a heck of a fight.

04:36.807 --> 04:40.197
The important thing is the good guys won.

04:54.167 --> 04:55.680
(GRUNTING)

05:00.767 --> 05:01.961
Cut!

05:14.367 --> 05:15.482
Cut!

05:15.567 --> 05:16.886
(GROANS)

05:28.567 --> 05:29.636
(SPITTING)

05:29.727 --> 05:30.796
Cut!

05:32.287 --> 05:35.165
DIRECTOR: This guy is pathetic!
He's ruining every shot!

05:35.767 --> 05:37.246
You, come here!

05:38.567 --> 05:40.364
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Sorry?

05:40.447 --> 05:41.516
Is that what you're going to say

05:41.607 --> 05:43.757
when you endanger your brothers
on the holy mission?

05:43.847 --> 05:46.156
- No.
- Just stay out of the shot.

05:47.447 --> 05:48.721
Yes, sir.

05:49.287 --> 05:52.723
My wife's cousin.
Otherwise, I send him back home tomorrow!

05:53.207 --> 05:56.085
Okay, everybody, from the top, huh?
Let's shoot this puppy!

05:56.167 --> 05:57.441
Come on. Come on.

06:36.887 --> 06:38.605
(ONE PLAYING)

06:51.287 --> 06:52.481
(SINGING) One, pah!

06:53.047 --> 06:54.958
Singular sensation

06:55.047 --> 06:57.277
Every little step she takes

06:58.727 --> 07:00.001
One, pah!

07:00.647 --> 07:02.478
Thrilling combination

07:02.567 --> 07:05.035
Every move that she makes

07:06.727 --> 07:10.003
OMER: One smile and suddenly nobody

07:10.087 --> 07:12.647
else will do

07:14.247 --> 07:17.045
You know you'll never be lonely

07:17.127 --> 07:19.846
With you-know-who

07:21.367 --> 07:23.597
One moment

07:23.687 --> 07:24.722
Oh!

07:24.807 --> 07:26.240
What is this?

07:26.327 --> 07:27.726
Was I being loud?

07:27.807 --> 07:30.082
You could hear it down into the valley.

07:30.727 --> 07:32.080
Hey...

07:34.407 --> 07:35.760
That was rare.

07:35.847 --> 07:37.246
You are lucky it was me who found you,

07:37.327 --> 07:40.046
not one of the others
because they would cut your throat!

07:40.127 --> 07:42.880
I'm so sorry. I like show tunes.

07:43.327 --> 07:46.956
I grew up listening to them,
my mother had a collection of 50 records.

07:47.047 --> 07:49.242
Your mother was killed
by an American bomb.

07:49.327 --> 07:50.646
I know that.

07:51.087 --> 07:52.839
That is why I'm here.

07:53.047 --> 07:55.686
Look, I've got some news for you.

07:56.167 --> 07:57.600
Your papers came through.

07:57.687 --> 08:00.997
You are leaving next week for Frankfurt,
and from there to Orange County.

08:01.087 --> 08:04.318
You'll be staying at our mutual cousins'.
They know nothing of your purpose there.

08:04.407 --> 08:07.604
You are to just wait
until your sleeper cell contacts you.

08:07.687 --> 08:09.325
When will that be?

08:10.767 --> 08:11.882
Never.

08:17.567 --> 08:21.685
I can't. I just can't, I can't, I can't.
I can't possibly. I can't do it.

08:22.167 --> 08:26.001
It's too horrible.
Please, not another season, please.

08:26.087 --> 08:29.284
I beg you, don't make me do it.
Don't make me do it.

08:29.367 --> 08:30.720
- Don't make me do it.
- Everyone's ready for you, sir.

08:30.807 --> 08:34.515
Right, terrific. Okay, let's go!
Let's rock and roll, yeah?

08:35.567 --> 08:39.879
Good morning. Good morning, everyone.
Lovely to see you again.

08:40.207 --> 08:43.482
Or, rather, not see you.
Can we have the house lights, please?

08:43.847 --> 08:44.962
Now?

08:45.607 --> 08:46.722
Now?

08:47.607 --> 08:50.121
Not next Tuesday. Cheers. Boo!

08:50.207 --> 08:51.401
ALL: Boo!

08:51.607 --> 08:54.326
Here we are again. Here we are, yet again.

08:54.567 --> 08:58.401
Here we are, producing
the most popular show on television.

08:58.487 --> 09:02.275
The show to which not only America,
but now the whole world is glued. Yay!

09:05.487 --> 09:08.684
Which brings me to the task at hand.

09:08.767 --> 09:10.883
When you're on top,
there's only one place to go.

09:10.967 --> 09:12.844
- And where is that?
- Down!

09:13.167 --> 09:14.600
Who said that?

09:19.847 --> 09:21.997
"Down" is an incorrect answer.

09:23.727 --> 09:26.446
The answer is "up." Up!

09:28.047 --> 09:30.515
Because if you go down,
do you know what happens?

09:30.607 --> 09:34.919
All those people who were buttering you up
and smiling at you just moments ago

09:35.007 --> 09:38.283
leap on you and kick you and kick you

09:38.367 --> 09:41.916
and kick you and kick you
and kick you until you shut up.

09:46.127 --> 09:48.083
Down is not an option.

09:50.927 --> 09:51.962
So,

09:52.807 --> 09:56.117
let's go out there
and get some great contestants.

09:56.567 --> 09:59.445
And I don't just mean talented,
I mean human.

10:00.007 --> 10:04.159
And by human, I mean flawed.
And by flawed, I mean freaks.

10:04.367 --> 10:06.119
Bring me some freaks.

10:06.447 --> 10:08.756
Let's make this a show
that even I would watch.

10:09.647 --> 10:11.046
(DOORBELL RINGING)

10:11.327 --> 10:13.921
- Is it them? Is that them?
- Don't run!

10:14.327 --> 10:15.442
(THUDDING)

10:16.207 --> 10:18.038
Wait, wait, wait! Your hair!

10:18.767 --> 10:21.156
- Okay, okay, okay. Stop, Mom.
- All right. Go!

10:23.927 --> 10:25.804
Oh, Goddess, please, please, please.

10:32.207 --> 10:34.721
- Sally Kendoo?
- Yeah.

10:34.807 --> 10:36.525
We're from American Dreamz.

10:37.167 --> 10:39.522
- I know.
- And we're here to tell you...

10:39.607 --> 10:41.518
You've been selected
to perform on the show.

10:41.607 --> 10:42.676
(SCREAMING)

10:42.767 --> 10:43.995
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

10:44.087 --> 10:45.964
- Why do you do that?
- Do what?

10:46.047 --> 10:47.162
You know what.

10:47.247 --> 10:50.603
Just once I would like to tell when...
What are you doing?

10:51.247 --> 10:52.805
Sorry. Screaming.

10:53.167 --> 10:55.237
- Yes! Yes!
- Stop! Stop, stop screaming.

10:55.327 --> 10:56.680
- Stop.
- ITTLES: Dude.

10:56.807 --> 11:00.322
I'm really sorry.
We're gonna have to do this all over again.

11:00.407 --> 11:03.080
You're gonna have to go inside,
and come out

11:03.167 --> 11:04.964
and jump for joy all over again,

11:05.047 --> 11:07.436
because we didn't get it on camera.

11:08.367 --> 11:09.482
Okay.

11:10.767 --> 11:11.802
(DOOR CLOSES)

11:16.727 --> 11:18.718
Yes! I got it! I got it!

11:18.807 --> 11:20.763
- She's good.
- Yes! Yes!

11:22.887 --> 11:24.798
There's my guy.

11:25.127 --> 11:26.924
Congratulations, Mr President.

11:27.007 --> 11:30.238
You said we'd tear them a new one
and we tore them a new one.

11:30.567 --> 11:31.841
Excuse me.

11:31.927 --> 11:34.441
The big guy up there tore them a new one.
He smited them.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.597
- Smote.
- Smote, smited, whatever.

11:36.687 --> 11:38.484
What's with the papers? New puppy?

11:38.567 --> 11:40.478
- They're newspapers.
- I can see that.

11:40.567 --> 11:43.240
- Hi, Mrs P. You look beautiful.
- Good morning, Wally.

11:43.327 --> 11:46.637
- So, Mr P, you ready to meet the press?
- Not right now.

11:46.727 --> 11:48.604
Mr P, we discussed this.

11:48.687 --> 11:51.520
I mean, it was your idea
to meet the press after the big win.

11:51.607 --> 11:55.805
Herald in a new era of openness,
what with our overwhelming mandate.

11:55.967 --> 11:59.801
Yeah, I know.
It's just that there is a lot of stuff in here.

11:59.927 --> 12:02.646
It... There's a lot of interesting things.

12:02.727 --> 12:06.083
Well, yeah, there is a lot of stuff.
They have to fill the pages with something.

12:06.167 --> 12:08.522
But I think "interesting" is stretching it.

12:09.007 --> 12:11.282
Well, for instance, did you know

12:12.207 --> 12:15.404
that there are two kinds of Iraqistanis?

12:15.647 --> 12:17.478
(STAMMERING) I mean, actually,

12:17.567 --> 12:20.127
three kinds of Iraqis.

12:20.287 --> 12:22.642
Do you mean,
Sunnis and Shiites and Kurds?

12:23.207 --> 12:24.435
You knew about this?

12:24.527 --> 12:26.518
So did you. You knew this, Mr P.

12:26.607 --> 12:28.882
- Yeah, but...
- It's in your weekly digests.

12:28.967 --> 12:30.958
It's not like in this country,

12:31.047 --> 12:34.926
where whites and blacks and Latinos
all get along

12:35.007 --> 12:38.682
and there's no prejudicial deal
between them. I mean, these people,

12:38.767 --> 12:41.486
they have some long-standing
beefs with each other.

12:41.567 --> 12:45.276
MRS. STATON: Look, honey.
American Dreamz is coming on again soon.

12:46.487 --> 12:47.920
That's great. Great.

12:48.167 --> 12:51.876
Mr President,
we have to get you dressed and prepped.

12:51.967 --> 12:53.685
The press is waiting for you.

12:53.767 --> 12:55.997
You mean,
they're all out there waiting for me?

12:56.087 --> 12:57.486
They certainly are.

13:04.247 --> 13:06.807
Well, I just want to sit here
and read for a while.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.799
I think I deserve a break.
I'm kind of exhausted.

13:09.887 --> 13:11.286
Mr P, we need...

13:11.367 --> 13:14.598
I am not going out there right now,
g-damn it!

13:15.887 --> 13:19.243
Move it. Fun in a bucket.
Fun in a bucket, everybody.

13:19.327 --> 13:21.283
All right, all right.

13:21.647 --> 13:24.002
Hey, Willie, where's Sally?
Get her down here!

13:24.087 --> 13:25.600
- Oh, you know how girls are.
- Yeah.

13:25.687 --> 13:29.123
Hey, man. That's some girlfriend you got.
When you gonna marry that girl?

13:29.207 --> 13:30.606
We're talking about it, Uncle Fitz.

13:30.687 --> 13:32.359
We're thinking maybe next spring, huh?

13:32.447 --> 13:34.039
All righty. All right!

13:38.727 --> 13:40.524
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

13:40.847 --> 13:43.964
- WILLIE: Hey, Sally, it's you-know-who.
- Come on in, Willie.

13:44.687 --> 13:46.643
The door's locked, babe.

13:55.607 --> 13:57.199
What are you doing up here, Sally,

13:57.287 --> 14:00.006
when everybody's down there
celebrating your triumph?

14:00.087 --> 14:03.363
(CHUCKLING) Great.
I'm really excited for them.

14:03.727 --> 14:05.763
And they're really excited for you.

14:06.207 --> 14:09.802
You know, I am, too. I don't think
I've ever been prouder in my life.

14:09.887 --> 14:11.081
You know what?

14:11.167 --> 14:14.716
I was pretty excited for myself, too,
for like a half hour.

14:14.847 --> 14:18.920
And then it sunk in that this means nothing.

14:19.847 --> 14:21.200
Nothing?

14:21.407 --> 14:24.558
Sally, this is your dream.
You've always wanted to be on TV.

14:24.647 --> 14:27.605
No. I've always wanted to be a star.

14:27.767 --> 14:29.200
Isn't that the same thing?

14:29.287 --> 14:33.360
No, Willie, it's not the same thing.
Any idiot can be on TV nowadays.

14:33.647 --> 14:37.526
All you have to do is swap your wife
or eat a sheep's anus or something.

14:37.607 --> 14:40.804
Yes. Yes, but you are gonna sing.

14:41.647 --> 14:43.399
Yeah. I'm gonna sing.

14:44.087 --> 14:46.521
I'm gonna sing. And I'm not good enough.

14:46.647 --> 14:48.399
I'm not good enough!

14:48.687 --> 14:50.678
- Seven years!
- No, you know what I am?

14:50.767 --> 14:54.521
I am the best karaoke singer
in this county of Ohio.

Oh, well, now he looks
as strange as you two do.

27:02.487 --> 27:04.796
Nonsense. He looks adorable.

27:04.887 --> 27:07.924
He barely let us spend anything on him.
All this stuff was on sale.

27:08.007 --> 27:10.077
Thank you so much.
This is more than I need.

27:10.167 --> 27:13.045
You see?
You two need to learn a lot from this fellow.

27:13.127 --> 27:15.925
Darling, we must get him
his own credit card.

27:16.887 --> 27:18.036
Why not?

27:18.527 --> 27:20.882
Hey, Omeriser. Want to see something cool?

27:20.967 --> 27:22.639
Watch out.
Super-gay-meister might jump you!

27:22.727 --> 27:25.287
Shut up, hairy she-male! Let's go.

Super freak

27:29.327 --> 27:31.238
She's super freaky

27:47.807 --> 27:48.842
Wow.

27:50.807 --> 27:51.922
Bravo!

27:53.127 --> 27:54.606
Okay. Thank you.

27:54.687 --> 27:56.245
- Thanks.
- Oh, the shaking.

27:56.327 --> 27:59.125
Okay, now you're just making fun of me.
Stop.

28:00.207 --> 28:01.560
No! No!

28:01.647 --> 28:04.957
No, you are extremely talented, cousin.

28:05.247 --> 28:09.763
Not only as a singer but as a dancer.
You have pizzazz, my friend.

28:10.447 --> 28:11.596
Really?

28:11.927 --> 28:14.043
- You really think so?
- Yes.

28:14.687 --> 28:15.756
Wow.

28:15.847 --> 28:17.997
How strange to not be met with mockery.

28:18.087 --> 28:19.440
Who mocks you?

28:19.527 --> 28:22.121
Everyone! That's why
no one's allowed down here.

28:22.207 --> 28:24.926
Oh, this is a spectacular set-up you have.

28:25.127 --> 28:26.526
You think so?

28:27.727 --> 28:30.241
Gosh! I really wish
you would have been here last month!

28:30.327 --> 28:32.522
I taped an audition for American Dreamz.

28:32.607 --> 28:35.917
Had to have Shazzy run the camera.
She couldn't stop shaking with laughter.

28:36.007 --> 28:38.840
- So, how do you work the lighting in here?
- Oh, I'll show you.

29:00.887 --> 29:04.482
- Hey, how long you been in Iraq?
- Fourteen months.

29:04.567 --> 29:08.321
Wow. Fourteen months.
You must have seen a lot of stuff.

29:09.047 --> 29:10.958
This is my first day here.

29:11.047 --> 29:13.197
In fact, I just joined the Army
two weeks ago.

29:13.287 --> 29:16.085
I had kind of an accelerated basic training.

29:16.407 --> 29:20.195
I was pretty surprised when they said,
"Pack your bags, you're going to Iraq."

29:20.367 --> 29:22.927
Honestly, I thought they were joking.

29:24.247 --> 29:26.477
Hey, you got any advice for me?

29:27.807 --> 29:29.525
Don't get shot.

29:30.327 --> 29:31.806
Don't get shot!

29:32.087 --> 29:33.839
Okay. Will do.

29:33.927 --> 29:35.519

What was that?

29:37.287 --> 29:38.322
(MACHINE GUN FIRING)

29:38.407 --> 29:40.363
I think you just got shot.

29:41.207 --> 29:42.686
My tattoo!

29:43.967 --> 29:46.322
First off, I think you're really talented

29:46.407 --> 29:48.398
and you have a chance
to win this whole thing.

29:48.487 --> 29:50.921
A chance? She's going to win it all, mister.

29:51.007 --> 29:52.884
Mom, shut up. Go on, Chet Krogl.

29:52.967 --> 29:56.562
Thank you. I know she's gonna win, Martha.
That's why I'm representing her.

29:56.647 --> 29:59.957
But winning American Dreamz
isn't just about talent.

30:00.047 --> 30:02.356
You have to have a story.

30:02.647 --> 30:06.003
Now, the whole
poor white trash thing is great.

30:06.087 --> 30:07.964
Well, we're not white trash.

30:08.047 --> 30:11.119
No. No, no, no. Of course not, of course not.

30:11.207 --> 30:12.879
But it doesn't hurt to imply that you are.

30:12.967 --> 30:15.276
Look what it's done for Britney Spears.

30:15.367 --> 30:18.325
See, everyone in America
thinks they're middle class.

30:18.407 --> 30:20.557
So they like to have someone
to look down on.

30:20.647 --> 30:21.841
We are middle class.

30:21.927 --> 30:25.237
Mom, shut your gaping pie hole.
Go on, Chet Krogl.

30:25.607 --> 30:28.075
Human interest is what wins these things.

30:28.167 --> 30:30.442
Now, absent father's not bad.

30:30.567 --> 30:31.966
You two are divorced, right?

30:32.047 --> 30:34.925
Well, Daddy lives with another man
in Chicago.

30:35.007 --> 30:36.565
Another man.

30:37.847 --> 30:40.566
Maybe? Well, no.

30:41.007 --> 30:43.726
Let's not feature that.
That's too much of a wild card.

30:43.807 --> 30:47.436
Now, one thing that is important, Sally,
is that you not appear to want it too much.

30:47.527 --> 30:49.677
I'm just singing for the love of singing.

30:49.767 --> 30:51.564
As long as I get to get on that stage

30:51.647 --> 30:55.845
and perform in front of
that incredible audience, I'm happy.

30:56.407 --> 30:58.238
Not bad. Not bad.

30:59.847 --> 31:02.236
Now, of course, on the inside,
you do need to want it really badly.

31:02.327 --> 31:05.364
Mr Krogl, I'd rather jab my eyes out
with toothpicks and eat them

31:05.447 --> 31:07.802
- than lose this thing.
- Okay. Awesome!

31:08.847 --> 31:13.045
There's sort of this Hollywood thing,
the camera puts on 10 pounds.

31:13.127 --> 31:16.005
- So, you're gonna want to lose 20.
- Screw you.

31:16.407 --> 31:19.046
I control my weight swings. No one else.

31:19.127 --> 31:23.757
Having a little extra meat, taking it off,
packing it on can make people root for you.

- Could you get that?
- Yes.

31:42.927 --> 31:46.044
Oh, my Lord! Sally, you better get over here.

31:49.367 --> 31:53.485
It's William. He's back.
And I think he's been wounded.

31:55.287 --> 31:57.084

- I know.
- Poor William.

MRS. KENDOO: I don't think
he's going away.

32:06.567 --> 32:08.000
Who's William?

32:08.087 --> 32:09.998
It's Sally's old boyfriend.

32:10.087 --> 32:12.237
She broke up with him a few weeks ago.

32:12.327 --> 32:13.919
Yeah, it just wasn't gonna work.

32:14.007 --> 32:17.044
Every time he smiled, I wanted to hit him
in the head with my shoe.

32:17.527 --> 32:20.246
So he's a returning war veteran
injured in Iraq?

32:20.327 --> 32:21.680
That's right.

32:23.287 --> 32:24.402
Yep.

32:25.287 --> 32:26.959
Sally, remember what I said

32:27.047 --> 32:30.198
about human interest being the thing
that wins American Dreamz?

32:47.127 --> 32:49.800
Yeah, I can see. I'm so, so sorry.

32:52.487 --> 32:56.002
Well, I just came to say hi, so...

32:56.167 --> 32:57.839
Yeah. But, William,

32:58.247 --> 33:01.523
I'm actually really happy that you're home

- Sally, who's the guy with the video camera?
- Nobody. He's just my agent.

weren't allowed inside for the meeting.

33:41.327 --> 33:43.716
I am terrified of North Korea.

33:47.567 --> 33:49.364
That the sirens are going off

that the North Koreans are attacking.

I mean, have you had
a frigging nervous breakdown?

34:45.367 --> 34:46.482
Uh, no.

34:46.567 --> 34:50.606
"Uh, no" is not a very reassuring answer.

34:50.967 --> 34:54.243
Joe, you remember when we first met?

34:54.527 --> 34:57.519
When I came up to you at that fundraiser
for your dad and I said,

34:57.607 --> 34:59.120
"You're gonna make
one hell of a President,"

34:59.207 --> 35:03.166
and you said, "You mean my dad is,"
and I said, "No, pal. You are."

35:03.247 --> 35:05.966
I kind of remember it. I was pretty toasted.

35:06.127 --> 35:09.244
Is that what's happening here?
Are you getting toasted again?

- No! Of course not.

35:17.047 --> 35:18.526
It's just that

35:19.167 --> 35:23.604
there are some things that kind of seemed
pretty black-and-white.

35:24.407 --> 35:25.840

We met at upfronts a couple of years ago.

39:52.927 --> 39:54.201
Right. Yeah, Chet Krogl.

39:54.287 --> 39:56.801
- I don't want to talk to you.
- Okay. No problem.

39:56.887 --> 40:00.562
Do you know what? Do you think I might
go upstairs and talk to Sally in private?

40:01.087 --> 40:03.123
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

40:26.567 --> 40:29.286
- Cool car.
- Thank you very much. Thank you.

40:29.847 --> 40:32.759
Not easy renting a Ferrari in Padookie, Ohio.

40:35.727 --> 40:38.605
I'm surprised that you're here,
'cause I thought

40:38.687 --> 40:41.679
we were supposed to meet
for the first time onstage at the show.

40:41.767 --> 40:44.565
Yeah. Normally we would.
I never produce these segments.

40:44.647 --> 40:47.445
But I heard Padookie was an exciting town,
thought I'd check it out.

40:49.767 --> 40:51.803
- That was a joke.
- I'm aware.

40:52.567 --> 40:54.159
You didn't laugh.

40:54.327 --> 40:55.965
It wasn't funny.

40:57.527 --> 40:58.562
No.

41:00.247 --> 41:02.966
But why didn't you laugh
just to kiss my ass?

41:03.247 --> 41:05.238
I figure you didn't need me to kiss your ass.

41:05.327 --> 41:09.525
I mean, I'm sure you have people
kissing your ass 24 hours a day.

41:10.727 --> 41:15.084
And I guess, like, not kissing your ass
is like kissing your ass for most people.

41:16.287 --> 41:17.845
Absolutely right.

41:19.767 --> 41:23.077
It's weird. One can become quite detached
from reality when one's famous.

41:23.167 --> 41:24.316
Really.

41:25.767 --> 41:27.280
That sounds so cool.

41:27.367 --> 41:29.562
Yeah, it can be.

41:33.567 --> 41:37.446
So, Sally, I've seen your tapes
and I think you're very talented.

41:38.007 --> 41:40.965
- Really? You do?
- Well, moderately.

41:41.767 --> 41:43.439
But beyond that...

41:43.727 --> 41:45.080
Beyond that?

41:45.767 --> 41:47.519
I think I like you.

41:49.527 --> 41:51.279
I don't mean romantically, I mean

41:53.167 --> 41:55.556
I think I like you as a human being.

42:01.127 --> 42:02.924
MARTIN: So, have you ever been
in a Ferrari before?

42:03.007 --> 42:04.918
SALLY: Yeah, yeah, tons of times.

42:07.127 --> 42:10.244
You know, sometimes I'll be driving
my Enzo down Mulholland Drive,

42:10.327 --> 42:13.524
really gunning it. I'll look at the little railing
at the side of the road

42:13.607 --> 42:15.882
and the steep drop just beyond that
and I'll think,

42:15.967 --> 42:19.482
"Wouldn't it be great just to shoot
off the edge of the cliff?"

42:20.087 --> 42:22.806
- Wouldn't that be fun?
- Mr Tweed, I...

42:22.887 --> 42:25.720
No, no, no, no, no. Don't call me Mr Tweed.
Call me Tweedy.

42:25.807 --> 42:29.277
- Like Tweety Bird, but with a 'd'?
- Exactly, yeah.

42:30.007 --> 42:34.125
You know, my mum used to say to me,
"Martin, you have no talent.

42:34.247 --> 42:36.044
"No one will ever love you."

42:36.127 --> 42:39.517
Well, look at me now, Mum!
Look where no talent will get you!

42:39.807 --> 42:42.037
You jealous, drunk old bitch.

42:42.247 --> 42:43.965
Really, that's great.

42:44.047 --> 42:47.278
But, Tweedy, can you help me win?

42:47.527 --> 42:50.280
Because I would do absolutely anything
to win this show.

42:50.367 --> 42:53.518
I'd love to help you, Sally,
but there's only so much I can do.

42:53.607 --> 42:56.075
It's down to you.
You've got to make the people love you.

42:56.167 --> 42:59.364
- The way that they love you?
- Nope. Nobody loves me.

43:00.167 --> 43:03.557
My mum was right about that.
But it's fine, I don't care.

43:04.007 --> 43:07.238
I don't want the fake bullshit
that passes for love in this world.

43:07.327 --> 43:11.081
Well, you don't have to worry about me,
I'm not even sure that I like you.

43:11.607 --> 43:12.642
Wow.

43:13.207 --> 43:15.118
My God,
I can't believe I just said that out loud.

43:15.207 --> 43:16.879
I never say stuff like that out loud.

43:16.967 --> 43:19.162
I think you are a rapacious little bitch.

43:19.247 --> 43:21.920
Well, I think you're a self-involved,
preening idiot.

43:22.007 --> 43:24.805
Sociopathic, egomaniacal,
Madonna wannabe.

43:24.887 --> 43:28.880
No-talent, famous-for-being-famous,
third-rate, Regis Philbin clone!

43:31.127 --> 43:33.687
SHAZZY: So, at the mall today,
I upgraded my plan to 5,000 minutes,

43:33.767 --> 43:34.836
but it's a family plan.

43:34.927 --> 43:37.964
- Thank you, Auntie.
- IQBAL: You should've gotten 10,000.

43:38.047 --> 43:39.765
- Lqbal?
- Yeah.

43:40.567 --> 43:44.003
Something very odd happened today.
It's funny, really.

43:44.087 --> 43:47.841
You see, these people from the
American Dreamz television show came by.

43:51.047 --> 43:53.197
- Yeah?
- And...

43:55.687 --> 43:57.723
- And?
- And I was using your stage

43:57.807 --> 44:00.321
and they heard me singing
and they want me to be on the show.

44:03.127 --> 44:07.439
I'm sorry. Did you say they want you
to sing on the show?

44:07.527 --> 44:08.562
Mmm-hmm.

44:08.647 --> 44:09.921
Isn't that amusing?

44:10.007 --> 44:11.759
- Holy crap.
- NAZNEEN: Shazzy.

44:12.247 --> 44:14.556
- Congratulations, Omer!
- Thank you.

44:14.647 --> 44:16.797
"Congratulations, Omer!"
That's what you have to say!

44:16.887 --> 44:18.605
"Congratulations, Omer!"

44:18.967 --> 44:21.686
Do you know how hard I have worked
to get on this show?

44:21.767 --> 44:23.519
You've stolen my dream!

44:23.607 --> 44:26.997
I'm so sorry. I told them.
I told them they had made a mistake.

44:27.407 --> 44:28.476
But do not worry.

44:28.567 --> 44:32.560
I will simply refuse
to be on the television show. Yes?

44:32.647 --> 44:35.002
Yes, and then they must take you instead.

44:35.127 --> 44:36.845
They don't want me.

44:37.527 --> 44:40.121
Nobody wants me!

44:40.527 --> 44:43.246
Nonsense, sweetheart. We all love you.

44:44.407 --> 44:47.524
Is that going to make me famous?
I don't think so.

44:56.527 --> 44:59.439
MARTIN: (ON TV) Next week, the exciting
premiere episode of American Dreamz.

44:59.527 --> 45:02.678
Which of these hopefuls will live
the next American dream?

45:07.967 --> 45:10.879
Wait. Rewind the TiVo.

45:16.327 --> 45:17.601
Pause it.

45:20.927 --> 45:23.282
- Hello.
- Hello, Mrs Riza.

45:23.687 --> 45:26.520
- Is Omer at home, please?
- Yes, he is.

45:27.287 --> 45:29.642
Who shall I say is asking for him?

45:29.727 --> 45:32.036
Just some friends.

45:34.287 --> 45:35.879
NAZNEEN: Come in, please.

45:42.567 --> 45:45.684
- Sun block, anyone?
- Yes. Thank you, Auntie.

45:45.767 --> 45:46.802
NAZNEEN: Sure.

45:47.327 --> 45:50.364
Now, I am going to bring you boys
a little treat.

45:50.807 --> 45:52.081
Thank you.

45:59.367 --> 46:01.756
Very cushy situation you have here.

46:03.527 --> 46:06.564
- No pool?
- No. No, just the Jacuzzi.

46:11.447 --> 46:15.076
The Western Command has learned of you
being chosen to sing and dance

46:15.167 --> 46:19.285
on a hedonistic television show
aptly named American Dreamz.

46:20.447 --> 46:23.484
Wow. You guys heard about that?

46:25.807 --> 46:27.604
OMER: It's all a big mistake, you see.

46:27.687 --> 46:30.485
They got me mixed up with my cousin.

46:30.927 --> 46:34.636
Because I would never engage
in such a frivolous activity.

46:35.207 --> 46:38.517
In fact, I'm going to tell them
I will not be on the show.

46:38.647 --> 46:40.717
You are to do no such thing.

46:40.967 --> 46:42.958
You are to perform on the show.

46:43.047 --> 46:45.481
And you must get
to the championship round,

46:45.567 --> 46:47.683
because judging the championship round

46:47.767 --> 46:51.840
will be none other than the
President of the United States of America.

46:52.727 --> 46:54.160
The President?

46:54.447 --> 46:59.123
When you are onstage with the President,
you will have smuggled in an explosive belt.

46:59.407 --> 47:01.682
And you are to martyr yourself.

47:01.767 --> 47:04.839
Killing, in the process,
the head of the serpent.

47:05.807 --> 47:08.241
What if I don't make it to the final round?

47:08.327 --> 47:11.285
Omer, folks don't call me "The Torturer"

47:11.367 --> 47:13.403
because I don't like to torture people.

47:13.487 --> 47:15.205
You know what I mean?

47:17.487 --> 47:20.797
Now, who would like to try
some grapefruit sorbet?

47:24.487 --> 47:28.241
In a busy political week capped by
a marked increase in his approval ratings,

47:28.327 --> 47:32.081
the President has stepped back into the
public eye in a string of high-profile events.

47:32.167 --> 47:34.840
REPORTER: (ON TV) Earlier this week,
he hosted the Ukrainian President,

47:34.927 --> 47:38.044
lifted weights with the head
of the Organisation of African States,

47:38.127 --> 47:40.118
spent some time with his dog, Henry,

47:40.207 --> 47:43.438
and chatted with Carmen Electra
at a black-tie event.

47:43.527 --> 47:44.880
- Thank you.
- You come back now, all right?

47:44.967 --> 47:46.480
- Okay. Nice meeting you.
- Okay.

47:48.247 --> 47:51.637
After weeks of seclusion,
suddenly the President is everywhere.

47:51.727 --> 47:53.046
Even signing on to guest judge

47:53.127 --> 47:56.483
the finale of the top-rated television show,
American Dreamz.

47:56.567 --> 47:58.797
You hear that? We're back.

47:59.767 --> 48:01.564
All right. Now hold still.

48:04.207 --> 48:05.356
It tickles.

48:05.447 --> 48:08.086
You want to wear this thing all night?
Then sit still.

48:12.167 --> 48:15.477
This thing is incredible. Great reception.

48:17.007 --> 48:19.885
I can't believe I didn't think of it earlier.

48:20.247 --> 48:23.922
Hell of a week, sir!
You really got back on message.

48:24.007 --> 48:26.567
That's because you're telling me
what the message is.

48:26.647 --> 48:27.796
Exactly.

48:28.927 --> 48:31.805
I just love that Carmen Electra. Thanks.

48:32.367 --> 48:34.562
I would have never had the courage to go up

48:34.647 --> 48:37.241
and talk to her by myself, face to face.

48:38.007 --> 48:39.440
Engaging girl.

48:40.487 --> 48:42.557
Good night, Mr President.

48:44.687 --> 48:46.086
(DOOR CLOSING)

48:53.287 --> 48:56.006
One and two. Three and four.

48:56.167 --> 48:57.282
Five...

48:58.167 --> 48:59.202
Hey.

48:59.927 --> 49:01.121
What are you doing?

49:01.207 --> 49:04.279
Nothing. Nothing.
I'm just rehearsing some dance steps.

49:04.367 --> 49:05.402
Oh.

49:05.607 --> 49:07.040
Look, lqbal.

49:08.007 --> 49:09.884
- I am so sorry...
- Stop.

49:11.447 --> 49:14.803
I don't want your pity.
Does it look like I need pity?

49:15.687 --> 49:18.201
No, no, no. You have far too much dignity.

49:18.287 --> 49:22.075
If these people know nothing about talent,
there's not much I can do about it, is there?

49:25.047 --> 49:27.845
So let's see it. Let's see your dance steps.

49:29.487 --> 49:30.761
All right.

49:34.127 --> 49:36.960
One and two. Three and four.

49:37.287 --> 49:38.356
What?

49:38.447 --> 49:40.677
Oh, there's no way
you're gonna win this thing.

49:41.327 --> 49:43.238
I know. I fear as much.

49:49.967 --> 49:52.162
IQBAL: Get up there. Up on the stage.

49:52.447 --> 49:53.880
Are you sure?

49:53.967 --> 49:56.162
Do it. Before I change my mind.

49:58.047 --> 50:01.722
Okay. Now this is just the bass track.
It's good to practice moves to.

50:02.007 --> 50:05.920
- I don't like this kind of music.
- It's just a bass track. It's just for rehearsal!

50:07.487 --> 50:08.681
Okay.

50:10.727 --> 50:14.766
Now, one problem you have is you move
like a re-animated corpse in a zombie movie.

50:14.847 --> 50:16.041
Not good.

50:16.287 --> 50:17.800
You need to loosen up.

50:18.807 --> 50:20.798
Okay. Come on, let's go.

50:20.887 --> 50:22.764
Free-form jazz dancing,
right now, immediately.

50:22.847 --> 50:24.963
Lqbal, why are you helping me?

50:25.527 --> 50:27.358
I destroyed your dream.

50:28.407 --> 50:29.522
Yeah.

50:30.087 --> 50:31.315
You did.

50:31.847 --> 50:33.565
But that was yesterday.

50:33.967 --> 50:37.277
Today, I've turned a page
on a new chapter in my life.

50:37.367 --> 50:41.121
I'm not sure being a performer
was ever what I was really meant for.

50:41.207 --> 50:44.563
I'm more of a behind-the-scenes player.
A puppeteer.

50:44.767 --> 50:46.405
A Svengali, if you will.

50:47.927 --> 50:49.406
As of today,

50:50.207 --> 50:51.845
I'm your manager.

50:53.047 --> 50:57.438
This is Martin Tweed, and I am
in the small town of Padookie, Ohio.

50:58.007 --> 51:00.441
Our first dream starts right here,

51:00.527 --> 51:04.406
where local chanteuse Sally Kendoo
hopes her dream comes true.

51:04.687 --> 51:06.120
(SCREAMING)

51:06.207 --> 51:08.004
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

51:08.327 --> 51:12.764
It was always Sally's idea to perform,
not mine.

51:13.327 --> 51:16.524
I mean, she's been wanting to do this
since she was six months old.

51:17.127 --> 51:18.401
Sing!

51:19.767 --> 51:23.362
She did it before. She's just shy.
Come on, honey. Sing!

51:23.807 --> 51:25.718
MARTIN: The last remaining business
on Main Street

51:25.807 --> 51:27.525
is Harry's Hangdown Bar and Grill

51:27.767 --> 51:30.235
where Sally works as a part-time waitress.

51:30.327 --> 51:32.158
The Hangdown is a home away from home

51:32.247 --> 51:34.886
for the largely unemployed male population
of Padookie.

51:34.967 --> 51:36.036
(ALL CHEERING)

51:40.007 --> 51:41.520
MAN: Come on! Yeah!

51:42.007 --> 51:44.965
MARTIN: Sally's high-school sweetheart
is a decorated war veteran,

51:45.047 --> 51:46.685
a real American hero.

51:48.407 --> 51:52.241
And halfway across America,
hailing from halfway around the world,

51:52.327 --> 51:55.603
Omer Obeidi lives with his cousins,
the Riza Family.

51:55.687 --> 51:58.247
A refugee from the mayhem
of the Middle East.

51:58.327 --> 52:01.956
I cannot believe my good fortune
to be competing on the show.

52:02.887 --> 52:05.606
This is truly an American dream come true.

52:06.727 --> 52:07.842
(WHISPERING) Now.

52:08.207 --> 52:09.356
Now.

52:09.487 --> 52:12.320
America, you will be Omerised.

52:14.287 --> 52:17.757
MARTIN: Like any American kid,
Omer likes to hang out at the mall

52:17.847 --> 52:19.485
where his posse all know him.

52:19.567 --> 52:21.285
Omer, American Dreamz, baby!

52:21.367 --> 52:23.358
Yo, Big O!
I like your style.

52:23.447 --> 52:25.961
O-mizzer! That's my dawg right there!

52:26.047 --> 52:27.844
Keep it real, man! Remember that.
Keep it real.

52:27.927 --> 52:31.966
There may not be peace in the Middle East,
but there is Middle East in this piece,

52:32.047 --> 52:36.438
as we visit cantor Sholem Glickstein,
recent Israeli immigrant.

52:36.687 --> 52:38.040
I wish Omer luck.

52:38.247 --> 52:41.319
I wish all of the contestants luck,
because I'm coming for them.

52:41.407 --> 52:42.476
Do you hear that?

52:42.567 --> 52:45.843
Do you hear that? I am coming
for you, bitches! I am coming for you!

52:46.927 --> 52:48.155
Looks great.

52:48.287 --> 52:51.006
Big day tomorrow, boss. You fired up?

52:51.647 --> 52:54.639
Yes. I am fired up.

52:58.567 --> 53:00.125
- Debra?
- Yes.

53:00.967 --> 53:02.639
Do you think I'm lovable?

53:03.687 --> 53:04.881
Lovable?

53:05.127 --> 53:08.403
Yeah. Yes, sure, very.

53:09.887 --> 53:11.161
Frank?

53:12.647 --> 53:15.559
I love you. That's all I know.

53:19.247 --> 53:21.158
Okay, thanks. You can go.

53:43.487 --> 53:46.718
Welcome! Welcome!
Welcome back, America!

53:47.207 --> 53:48.799
- Boo!
- AUDIENCE: Boo!

53:49.567 --> 53:51.842
I'm Martin Tweed
and I am so delighted to be back

53:51.927 --> 53:53.883
with another exciting season
of American Dreamz.

53:53.967 --> 53:55.400
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

53:55.767 --> 53:59.316
We have some amazing dreamers
who are gonna perform for you tonight.

53:59.527 --> 54:02.087
Some will triumph.
Some will sink back into obscurity.

54:02.167 --> 54:04.840
Only one will become
America's newest sensation.

54:04.927 --> 54:06.076
It's up to you, America.

54:06.167 --> 54:08.886
Only you have the awesome power
to lift someone up into the heavens

54:08.967 --> 54:10.241
and create a new star.

54:10.327 --> 54:12.397
And here are your dreamers!

54:22.607 --> 54:25.360
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Come on, watch your step! Watch your step!

54:25.447 --> 54:28.200
Go, go, go, go! Come on, get on up there!

54:28.287 --> 54:30.801
Let's go! Go! Move it out! Move it!

54:53.647 --> 54:56.957
I'd like to dedicate this song
to a real American hero.

54:57.167 --> 54:59.727
My boyfriend, William Williams.

55:03.167 --> 55:07.524
He risked his life for our freedom,
and that's a real American dream.

55:13.127 --> 55:15.402
(SINGING) Mommy, don't drink

55:15.487 --> 55:18.843
Me to bed tonight

55:19.527 --> 55:22.564
What's gotten into

55:22.647 --> 55:25.161
Your head tonight?

55:25.527 --> 55:28.041
Did I make you mad?

55:28.767 --> 55:31.361
Is that why you're sad?

55:32.447 --> 55:34.881
And, Daddy, where have

55:35.167 --> 55:38.125
You been all my life?

55:38.807 --> 55:41.321
Mommy said that

55:41.567 --> 55:44.286
You got a new wife

55:44.487 --> 55:47.638
And there's nothing to do

55:47.887 --> 55:50.606
But I know that's not true

55:50.887 --> 55:54.243
And there's no one to hold me

55:54.727 --> 55:57.287
Close when I cry

55:57.847 --> 56:00.645
To rock me so gentle

56:00.847 --> 56:03.725
Till the storm passes by

56:04.687 --> 56:07.076
And I'm just a kid

56:07.367 --> 56:10.564
But I know it ain't right

56:12.127 --> 56:14.880
So, Mommy, don't drink

56:14.967 --> 56:18.880
Me to bed tonight

56:33.407 --> 56:34.681
Sally.

56:37.207 --> 56:38.959
I think you're terrific.

56:39.087 --> 56:42.966
In fact, I think you have star quality.

56:43.647 --> 56:45.365
Thank you, Mr Tweed.

56:48.087 --> 56:49.725
Sally Kendoo.

56:53.287 --> 56:56.006
(SINGING) Girl, let's not be friends

56:56.087 --> 56:57.964
'Cause we've shared too much

56:58.047 --> 57:02.757
Girl, you know that
I'm yearning for your touch

57:02.927 --> 57:07.125
'Cause I can't be less than your everything

57:07.367 --> 57:09.756
'Cause I'll lay down and cry

57:09.847 --> 57:12.077
I'll curl up and die

57:12.167 --> 57:16.638
Don't let this be how my story ends

57:16.727 --> 57:18.957
It's love or good-bye

57:19.047 --> 57:21.561
So let's not be friends

57:21.647 --> 57:24.207
(SINGING) I'm a rocking man

57:24.287 --> 57:27.199
I'm a genuine rocking man

57:27.287 --> 57:31.326
I'm a rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Rocking man!

57:32.967 --> 57:36.437
I'm a rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock

57:36.527 --> 57:38.483
(SINGING) I never felt

57:38.887 --> 57:41.526
This way

57:42.287 --> 57:46.724
Before

57:48.207 --> 57:52.246
(SINGING) Girl, you know I want you
I got a rocket launcher

57:52.327 --> 57:55.046
So, baby, let's get raunchy tonight

57:55.127 --> 57:57.038
CHORUS: Let's get raunchy tonight

57:57.127 --> 58:00.802
I don't want to taunt you
Or take you out and flaunt you

58:00.887 --> 58:03.447
So, baby, let's get raunchy, all right

58:03.527 --> 58:06.166
CHORUS: Let's get raunchy, baby

58:14.847 --> 58:16.166
Sholem.

58:16.807 --> 58:18.877
I only have two words for you.

58:18.967 --> 58:20.161
Mazel tov!

58:20.847 --> 58:23.315
No, you were wonderful. Really, wonderful.

58:24.727 --> 58:27.685
Good news, Pauly.
I don't want to be your friend.

58:27.767 --> 58:30.725
In fact, you make me
want to projectile vomit.

58:31.407 --> 58:36.083
Bobby, I think my ears are actually bleeding.
You are like a musical Ebola virus.

58:36.407 --> 58:37.681
Cindy.

58:38.967 --> 58:41.276
I'm afraid I have felt this way before.

58:41.367 --> 58:44.916
And it was just before I tried to kill myself.
Sorry, love.

58:46.967 --> 58:48.116
Sorry.

58:50.647 --> 58:52.046
I hate you!

58:52.847 --> 58:54.280
Nice girl. Cindy.

59:04.607 --> 59:05.881
Here he is.

59:08.087 --> 59:09.839
Fantastic, Omer.

59:16.047 --> 59:18.436
- Don't clap.
- No, no, of course.

59:22.807 --> 59:24.365
(SINGING) To dream

59:24.647 --> 59:27.286
The impossible dream

59:29.887 --> 59:32.242
To fight

59:32.327 --> 59:36.161
The unbeatable foe

59:37.487 --> 59:39.637
To bear

59:39.967 --> 59:43.482
With unbearable sorrow

59:45.087 --> 59:48.682
To run where the brave dare not go

59:48.767 --> 59:51.998
What the hell is that?
He looks like he stepped on a scorpion.

59:52.087 --> 59:54.555
This is my quest

59:54.647 --> 59:57.559
To follow that star

59:57.647 --> 01:00:00.320
No matter how hopeless

01:00:00.407 --> 01:00:03.160
No matter how far

01:00:03.247 --> 01:00:05.556
To fight for the right

01:00:05.967 --> 01:00:08.845
Without question or pause

01:00:08.927 --> 01:00:12.044
To be willing to march into hell

01:00:12.127 --> 01:00:15.483
For a heavenly cause

01:00:15.567 --> 01:00:17.797
Go, Omer. Go.

01:00:17.887 --> 01:00:22.165
To reach the unreachable star

01:00:24.207 --> 01:00:26.243
You have been Omerised! Pah!

01:00:39.647 --> 01:00:40.762
Omer,

01:00:41.567 --> 01:00:43.398
that was strange.

01:00:43.807 --> 01:00:45.160
Strange,

01:00:46.487 --> 01:00:47.966
but rather wonderful.

01:00:48.767 --> 01:00:50.723
I think I have been Omerised.

01:00:50.807 --> 01:00:52.763
I think I might be Omer-sexual.

01:01:16.967 --> 01:01:18.320
Oh, my God!

01:01:21.087 --> 01:01:22.202
Yes!

01:01:22.727 --> 01:01:24.957
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:01:25.047 --> 01:01:26.241
Yes!

01:01:49.527 --> 01:01:53.679
SALLY: (SINGING) They came on boats
From across the sea

01:01:55.447 --> 01:01:57.756
From faraway places

01:01:57.847 --> 01:02:00.680
And far distant lands

01:02:01.887 --> 01:02:03.798
And still they come

01:02:04.127 --> 01:02:07.483
To a place where they're free

01:02:08.327 --> 01:02:10.318
They fly in on planes

01:02:10.487 --> 01:02:13.559
With hope in their hands

01:02:14.087 --> 01:02:16.601
Sometimes it feels

01:02:16.887 --> 01:02:19.685
Like we're stuffed to the seams

01:02:20.127 --> 01:02:24.279
But it's everyone's God-given right

01:02:25.767 --> 01:02:28.884
To follow their dreams

01:02:28.967 --> 01:02:31.037
CHORUS: My American dream

01:02:31.967 --> 01:02:34.720
SALLY: Will come true for me

01:02:35.127 --> 01:02:36.765
CHORUS: My American dream

01:02:36.887 --> 01:02:40.562
SALLY: For all to see

01:02:41.887 --> 01:02:44.879
Every woman and man

01:02:45.487 --> 01:02:48.718
Has their own destiny

01:02:49.527 --> 01:02:53.440
To dream American Dreamz

01:02:53.727 --> 01:02:55.843
Dreamz with a Z

01:02:55.927 --> 01:03:00.284
To dream American Dreamz

01:03:00.367 --> 01:03:03.040
Dreamz with a Z

01:03:04.247 --> 01:03:06.681
We began the show with 50 dreamers.

01:03:07.247 --> 01:03:09.397
Now we're down to just three.

01:03:12.447 --> 01:03:13.766
- Boo.
- AUDIENCE: Boo!

01:03:14.687 --> 01:03:16.166
How are you doing?

01:03:16.887 --> 01:03:18.366
You all right?

01:03:19.727 --> 01:03:21.877
And the two finalists

01:03:29.367 --> 01:03:32.882
will be revealed after this commercial break
brought to you by American Motors,

01:03:32.967 --> 01:03:36.562
introducing "The Tank," 50%% larger
than the next biggest SUV on the road,

01:03:36.647 --> 01:03:38.046
because you need it.

01:03:38.487 --> 01:03:41.638
STAGE MANAGER: And we're out! Come on,
people. Hair and makeup, let's go, let's go.

01:03:42.727 --> 01:03:45.036
All right.
Give me some room over here, Travis.

01:03:45.127 --> 01:03:48.722
Calm, calm, calm, calm.
Thank you, thank you very much.

01:03:49.047 --> 01:03:51.607
Here you go.
And you're supposed to be drinking this.

01:03:51.687 --> 01:03:53.723
- Must I?
- Contractually, yes.

01:03:53.807 --> 01:03:56.002
- Your envelope.
- Thank you.

01:03:57.167 --> 01:03:59.158
STAGE MANAGER: All right, let's wrap it up.
Let's get it started.

01:03:59.247 --> 01:04:00.441
Let's get the chairs out, let's go.

01:04:00.527 --> 01:04:02.358
Get the lead out. Big smiles, everyone.

01:04:02.447 --> 01:04:05.644
Big smiles. And we're back. Three, two.

01:04:06.847 --> 01:04:09.725
Excuse me. Delicious.
That's wildly refreshing.

01:04:10.527 --> 01:04:14.156
And now, America, you have voted.

01:04:25.287 --> 01:04:26.959
- Sholem Glickstein?
- Yeah.

01:04:38.447 --> 01:04:39.721
You are

01:04:42.127 --> 01:04:44.004
not a winner.

01:04:48.967 --> 01:04:51.640
This week's winners who will move on
to the championship round

01:04:51.727 --> 01:04:54.446
are Sally Kendoo and Omer Obeidi.
And don't forget,

01:04:54.527 --> 01:04:57.439
on next week's finale, special guest judge,
the President.

01:05:05.647 --> 01:05:06.762
Honey?

01:05:07.967 --> 01:05:10.003
I have a confession to make.

01:05:12.407 --> 01:05:14.682
I haven't been taking my happy pills.

01:05:16.367 --> 01:05:19.165
Actually, I haven't been taking mine, either.

01:05:19.487 --> 01:05:22.604
- But you don't seem sad.
- Well, I guess I'm not.

01:05:23.327 --> 01:05:26.876
At first, those happy pills
really helped me a lot.

01:05:27.167 --> 01:05:31.604
But, eventually, I think they were just
kind of like placebos.

01:05:32.207 --> 01:05:35.119
Placebos? Aren't they illegal?

01:05:36.607 --> 01:05:40.885
No, Poopie. It means fake.

01:05:43.887 --> 01:05:45.240
Well, yeah.

01:05:45.487 --> 01:05:46.602
Well.

01:05:49.807 --> 01:05:51.035
You know,

01:05:52.047 --> 01:05:55.596
I guess I kind of feel like I'm a placebo.

01:05:58.607 --> 01:06:01.519
I mean, I've had speech writers

01:06:01.927 --> 01:06:03.963
writing for me all my career,

01:06:04.047 --> 01:06:07.005
and advisors telling me
what positions to take.

01:06:09.127 --> 01:06:12.802
I can't even remember why I wanted
to get into politics to begin with.

01:06:14.367 --> 01:06:17.086
I think it's 'cause my mom wanted me to.

01:06:18.087 --> 01:06:20.521
Show my dad any idiot could do it.

01:06:21.607 --> 01:06:25.361
Maybe I ought to just chuck the whole thing.
What do you think?

01:06:25.567 --> 01:06:27.842
Starting with that American Dreamz deal.

01:06:27.927 --> 01:06:29.997
Don't you say that.

01:06:31.327 --> 01:06:35.320
Do you remember what I said
the first time I met you?

01:06:36.127 --> 01:06:37.242
Yeah.

01:06:37.487 --> 01:06:40.445
"Hey, jerk-off, you spilled your beer on me."

01:06:41.687 --> 01:06:43.166
After that.

01:06:43.887 --> 01:06:46.037
When you went and got that towel

01:06:46.127 --> 01:06:49.881
and borrowed that T-shirt
from one of your frat brothers for me.

01:06:50.687 --> 01:06:53.360
I said, "Now that there is a good guy."

01:06:53.767 --> 01:06:55.803
And I still think so today.

01:06:57.007 --> 01:07:01.159
So you just go on and be on that show.

01:07:02.327 --> 01:07:06.639
And then, afterwards, we will tell Wally
no more earplugs, okay?

01:07:08.767 --> 01:07:11.327
Well, how am I gonna know what to say?

01:07:12.767 --> 01:07:15.235
Well, we will think of it together.

01:07:17.887 --> 01:07:19.400
Mmm-hmm.

01:07:25.407 --> 01:07:27.318
Look at this! "Omer Mania!"

01:07:27.647 --> 01:07:30.366
"America's newest mascot, adorable,

01:07:30.847 --> 01:07:33.884
"Omer Obeidi
has 'Omerised' the whole country."

01:07:34.407 --> 01:07:36.284
It should have been me.

01:07:37.247 --> 01:07:39.841
I mean, great, Omer! They love you!

01:07:39.927 --> 01:07:40.962
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

01:07:41.047 --> 01:07:42.275
AGHA: Room service.

01:07:43.767 --> 01:07:47.157
Hey, what are you gonna say
when you meet the President?

01:07:48.367 --> 01:07:49.402
Sorry?

01:07:49.487 --> 01:07:52.047
"Sorry?" Omer, you crack me up.

01:07:52.127 --> 01:07:54.846
Okay, we got two orders
spicy tuna hand rolls,

01:07:54.927 --> 01:07:57.760
a plate of fresh fruit
and some chimichangas.

01:08:04.807 --> 01:08:07.367
Oh, you guys go ahead and start eating. I...

01:08:07.447 --> 01:08:10.996
I have to go talk to the waiter in private
for a moment.

01:08:13.207 --> 01:08:14.322
So.

01:08:15.447 --> 01:08:18.200
You have become quite the famous man.

01:08:19.006 --> 01:08:22.397
- You know why they vote for you?
- Because they like me?

01:08:22.487 --> 01:08:23.636
(SCOFFS)

01:08:24.687 --> 01:08:27.281
Because you are a figure of fun to them.

01:08:27.966 --> 01:08:31.163
They see you prancing and singing
and they can forget the terrors

01:08:31.247 --> 01:08:34.921
they've inflicted on our lands
with their soldiers and weapons.

01:08:35.006 --> 01:08:36.962
It could be. Yes, I guess.

01:08:37.207 --> 01:08:39.004
But I have to hand it to you.

01:08:39.167 --> 01:08:43.365
You have put us in a wonderful position
to strike them a crippling blow.

01:08:46.447 --> 01:08:48.358
About that crippling blow.

01:08:48.966 --> 01:08:50.639
I really don't know
how I'm supposed to do it.

01:08:50.727 --> 01:08:53.116
You see, really,
there is a lot of security there.

01:08:53.207 --> 01:08:56.165
All you have to do is get me and the rest
of your brothers on the guest list

01:08:56.247 --> 01:08:58.044
for the studio audience.

01:08:58.247 --> 01:09:01.876
We will smuggle in the explosive device
in pieces, assemble it there,

01:09:01.966 --> 01:09:03.639
and then you must only retrieve it

01:09:03.727 --> 01:09:07.162
in the toilet-seat-cover dispenser
in the men's bathroom.

01:09:07.367 --> 01:09:10.165
Then, when you meet the President

01:09:10.487 --> 01:09:13.285
and shake his hand, live on television,

01:09:13.367 --> 01:09:15.403
you will ignite the device.

01:09:16.006 --> 01:09:18.362
And I will see you in paradise.

01:09:19.607 --> 01:09:21.484
You will be killed, too?

01:09:21.767 --> 01:09:24.679
Not yet. It's a pretty small bomb.

01:09:25.247 --> 01:09:27.807
But I'll see you up there
in a few years, I'm sure.

01:09:30.846 --> 01:09:34.999
So, I'm just curious.
How is this Martin Tweed in person?

01:09:37.447 --> 01:09:38.720
(DOOR OPENS)

01:09:38.926 --> 01:09:41.202
Sally, Sally, Sally. I am so proud of you.

01:09:41.287 --> 01:09:44.323
I always knew you had a great voice
and now the whole world knows it, too.

01:09:44.407 --> 01:09:48.604
William, no, no. I have not won yet.
Everybody seems to be forgetting that.

01:09:48.687 --> 01:09:51.997
You know, folks,
they love that Middle Eastern guy.

01:09:52.087 --> 01:09:53.725
They love you more.

01:09:53.966 --> 01:09:57.642
They love us more. You know how many hits
we got on our website last night?

01:09:57.727 --> 01:09:59.319
Sixteen million.

01:10:00.127 --> 01:10:02.197
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:10:03.047 --> 01:10:07.677
God, William. You make me feel bad.
Why do you care so much about me?

01:10:07.847 --> 01:10:09.121
Why?

01:10:10.167 --> 01:10:14.046
Because, honey, you are my dream girl.

01:10:14.247 --> 01:10:15.600
Yuck.

01:10:15.687 --> 01:10:17.803
I can't stand looking
at those damn French fries anymore.

01:10:17.887 --> 01:10:19.479
Just cover them up or something.

01:10:20.127 --> 01:10:22.038
Sally Kendoo, I love you.

01:10:22.127 --> 01:10:24.357
Okay? I love you.

01:10:24.607 --> 01:10:27.121
I love how you binge eat
and then starve yourself.

01:10:27.207 --> 01:10:29.323
I love how pretty you sing,
whether it's in the shower

01:10:29.407 --> 01:10:31.443
or in front of millions of TV viewers.

01:10:31.527 --> 01:10:35.839
I look at you and I see that same girl
that I fell in love with in high school.

01:10:36.567 --> 01:10:39.240
And I'd like to know, right here and now,

01:10:40.007 --> 01:10:44.159
if you'd help to make my dream come true
and marry me?

01:10:45.367 --> 01:10:46.686
Oh, my God.

01:10:48.287 --> 01:10:49.686
Oh, my Lord.

01:10:49.767 --> 01:10:51.962
Hold it right there! Nobody move.

01:10:52.047 --> 01:10:54.038
- Chet, what are you doing?
- I'm calling the camera crew.

01:10:54.127 --> 01:10:56.083
No, you're not. Put the phone down, Chet.

01:10:56.167 --> 01:10:59.796
- Chet, put the phone down right now!
- Chet, put the phone down!

01:10:59.887 --> 01:11:02.401
What, are you kidding me?
This is great stuff.

01:11:04.687 --> 01:11:06.564
- And, William, stand up, please.
- But...

01:11:06.647 --> 01:11:07.921
Stand up.

01:11:08.287 --> 01:11:11.836
Now, please understand.
I am so touched by your proposal

01:11:11.927 --> 01:11:14.760
and the sweet things
that you just said to me, but...

01:11:15.167 --> 01:11:17.601
Right now is a really bad time.

01:11:17.687 --> 01:11:19.200
Do it on the show!

01:11:19.287 --> 01:11:21.198
- On the show?
- Absolutely.

01:11:21.287 --> 01:11:22.925
That's a great idea.

01:11:23.007 --> 01:11:24.042
- Really?
- CHET: Yes.

01:11:24.127 --> 01:11:26.118
And do that thing about how
every time you look at her

01:11:26.207 --> 01:11:28.277
you see the same girl
you fell in love with in high school.

01:11:28.367 --> 01:11:31.279
- What, you were listening?
- I'm in the other room, man, so, yes.

01:11:31.367 --> 01:11:34.518
And you. Hey, you!
Are you still into winning this thing?

01:11:34.607 --> 01:11:37.519
Because this is what we in the biz call
"incredible television."

01:11:37.607 --> 01:11:39.404
People are going to be
in their living rooms, sobbing.

01:11:39.487 --> 01:11:40.886
Then they're gonna be
crawling over each other

01:11:40.967 --> 01:11:43.765
trying to get to the phone
so they can call up and vote for you!

01:11:46.007 --> 01:11:50.239
Well, I'm up for it if you are, Sally.

01:11:50.327 --> 01:11:51.601
Yes! This guy!

01:11:51.687 --> 01:11:53.279
We are gonna get into this
with the producers.

01:11:53.367 --> 01:11:55.039
Can I see that ring for a second?

01:11:55.127 --> 01:11:56.526
Wow, that's great.

01:11:56.687 --> 01:11:58.518
We're gonna get a bigger one
so that it plays on TV,

01:11:58.607 --> 01:11:59.960
but there is nothing wrong with that ring.

01:12:00.047 --> 01:12:01.400
Now, here's what I'm thinking, okay?

01:12:01.487 --> 01:12:03.079
It's gonna be a special
built around the wedding.

01:12:03.167 --> 01:12:04.600
- Do you sing at all, William?
- I can sing a little bit.

01:12:04.687 --> 01:12:05.881
I thought you could sing a little bit.

01:12:05.967 --> 01:12:08.481
I think we're gonna call it
"Sally and William, sealed with a kiss."

01:12:08.567 --> 01:12:09.920
- What do you think about that?
- I love that.

01:12:10.007 --> 01:12:12.362
Yeah, I think everyone's gonna love that.

01:12:46.047 --> 01:12:47.321
Hey, Omer?

01:12:48.047 --> 01:12:49.765
Can I buy you a beer?

01:12:50.047 --> 01:12:53.357
Oh, no, no, no, no. I do not drink.
But thank you.

01:12:59.007 --> 01:13:02.841
Hey, do you ever wonder why you're doing
this whole competition thing for?

01:13:04.527 --> 01:13:06.119
Only every day.

01:13:10.807 --> 01:13:12.957
But then I think of my mother.

01:13:13.807 --> 01:13:16.037
She loved all types of singing.

01:13:17.247 --> 01:13:19.124
It keeps me going on.

01:13:25.847 --> 01:13:27.758
When I was 10 years old,

01:13:28.887 --> 01:13:30.605
I weighed 200 pounds.

01:13:32.607 --> 01:13:35.041
- That is large.
- Yeah.

01:13:37.967 --> 01:13:42.643
And I told myself I would lose 90 pounds
by the time I turned 14 or I would kill myself.

01:13:45.167 --> 01:13:46.680
So I lost the weight.

01:13:47.047 --> 01:13:48.321
And...

01:13:49.727 --> 01:13:51.922
I suddenly was really popular.

01:13:52.007 --> 01:13:56.159
I had a whole new group of friends.
I had this cute boyfriend.

01:13:56.567 --> 01:13:58.876
Even my teachers liked me better.

01:13:59.847 --> 01:14:01.678
And my mom and I
walked around the entire house

01:14:01.767 --> 01:14:05.521
collecting all the pictures of me
when I was fat and burned them.

01:14:08.447 --> 01:14:09.926
I love my mom.

01:14:16.727 --> 01:14:18.001
So.

01:14:19.567 --> 01:14:21.046
Good luck tomorrow.

01:14:22.327 --> 01:14:23.601
Thank you.

01:14:25.367 --> 01:14:27.676
Sorry I'm gonna have to destroy you.

01:14:50.287 --> 01:14:52.198
Here is your chewing gum.

01:14:52.727 --> 01:14:54.763
Remember, no blowing bubbles.

01:15:00.327 --> 01:15:02.283
Is this really necessary?

01:15:02.367 --> 01:15:06.076
Just a little bit higher. Oh, that's good.

01:15:07.287 --> 01:15:10.597
Yeah, that's beautiful.
Give me a little bit more in here.

01:15:10.687 --> 01:15:12.757
Take my moustache down a little bit, too.

01:15:16.487 --> 01:15:18.955
SHAZZY: My cousin's gonna be in the finale.

01:15:31.607 --> 01:15:33.006
- William?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:15:33.087 --> 01:15:34.964
Okay. Omer's gonna go on first.

01:15:35.047 --> 01:15:37.766
Then after Sally is done,
we're gonna hit you with a spotlight.

01:15:37.847 --> 01:15:40.202
Then you're gonna go onstage
and do your proposal.

01:15:40.287 --> 01:15:41.356
- Got it?
- Got it.

01:15:41.447 --> 01:15:43.836
- All right.
- It's happening.

01:15:44.927 --> 01:15:46.599
She's very excited.

01:15:46.767 --> 01:15:48.723
It's a joyful moment. Joyful.

01:15:51.127 --> 01:15:53.402
- Hi, Tweedy.
- Hi, Sally.

01:15:57.087 --> 01:16:00.636
Just wanted to say good luck tonight.

01:16:01.007 --> 01:16:02.281
Thank you.

01:16:02.447 --> 01:16:04.483
Could you just give us
a quick second, please?

01:16:04.567 --> 01:16:06.319
- Sure, no problem.
- Thank you.

01:16:11.567 --> 01:16:12.636
So.

01:16:13.767 --> 01:16:15.803
I think you're going to win.

01:16:16.847 --> 01:16:18.963
Novelty contestants
never win the whole thing.

01:16:19.047 --> 01:16:22.119
- That's why I've been helping him along.
- Thank you.

01:16:25.647 --> 01:16:27.524
Hey, is something wrong?

01:16:28.527 --> 01:16:29.642
No.

01:16:30.967 --> 01:16:33.527
I mean, nothing beyond
the usual creeping dread.

01:16:38.047 --> 01:16:41.357
All right. Well.
I'm sure you know at this point

01:16:41.447 --> 01:16:44.280
that William is supposed to propose to me
on tonight's show.

01:16:44.367 --> 01:16:45.436
Yeah.

01:16:46.367 --> 01:16:49.564
Do you think it's bad of me to accept
a proposal from a man I don't love

01:16:49.647 --> 01:16:52.320
in order to manipulate
people into voting for me?

01:16:53.447 --> 01:16:56.405
"Bad." Such a nebulous word, isn't it?

01:16:56.567 --> 01:16:59.923
You know what I think?
I think everyone wants something.

01:17:00.007 --> 01:17:01.599
William wants you.

01:17:02.167 --> 01:17:05.876
Why? Because he has this idea in his head
of what you are.

01:17:07.087 --> 01:17:11.000
I don't think he cares if it's true or not,
just so long as he keeps his fantasy alive.

01:17:11.087 --> 01:17:13.203
So I think he deserves what he gets.

01:17:13.287 --> 01:17:16.199
- He deserves to be miserable?
- Why not?

01:17:17.007 --> 01:17:18.679
You are, aren't you?

01:17:19.487 --> 01:17:22.160
Despite your newfound fame and adulation?

01:17:23.207 --> 01:17:24.242
Tweedy,

01:17:24.327 --> 01:17:28.400
I sometimes feel like you're the only person
in the whole world who really gets me.

01:17:30.647 --> 01:17:31.682
Yeah.

01:17:32.887 --> 01:17:36.038
Sometimes I look at you
and I see my own reflection.

01:17:36.687 --> 01:17:38.166
It's revolting.

01:17:39.487 --> 01:17:43.241
And attractive.

01:17:49.167 --> 01:17:50.441
Martin,

01:17:52.127 --> 01:17:56.200
I'm not physically attracted to other people,
but if you want me,

01:17:58.007 --> 01:17:59.326
I'm yours.

01:18:01.087 --> 01:18:04.875
The problem is I find that whenever
I become intimately involved

01:18:05.967 --> 01:18:07.764
with a woman I admire,

01:18:08.847 --> 01:18:11.884
it rapidly degenerates into mutual loathing.

01:18:13.247 --> 01:18:15.317
I don't want that to happen to us.

01:18:22.127 --> 01:18:23.765
Having said that...

01:18:53.727 --> 01:18:55.319
Omer, are you okay?

01:18:55.447 --> 01:18:58.325
Great. Great. Just a little nervous, I guess.

01:18:59.407 --> 01:19:01.796
- I just feel confused.
- About what?

01:19:01.927 --> 01:19:03.440
About this country.

01:19:03.527 --> 01:19:05.085
You know, there are
so many nice people here,

01:19:05.167 --> 01:19:07.727
but it does so much harm in the world.

01:19:08.087 --> 01:19:09.122
So?

01:19:09.207 --> 01:19:12.995
So, to what degree is this country
culpable for its actions?

01:19:13.487 --> 01:19:17.002
Are Americans to blame for America?
And beyond that,

01:19:17.847 --> 01:19:22.284
can causing someone else to suffer
ever truly ease one's own suffering?

01:19:22.807 --> 01:19:26.846
Omer! You're wigging out.
That bitch deserves to suffer!

01:19:27.567 --> 01:19:28.716
What bitch?

01:19:28.807 --> 01:19:30.001
Sally! Who are you talking about?

01:19:30.087 --> 01:19:31.122
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

01:19:31.207 --> 01:19:32.481
15 minutes, Omer.

01:19:32.887 --> 01:19:33.956
(SIGHING)

01:19:34.287 --> 01:19:37.040
Well, see, I think the dress works
'cause it flows nice.

01:19:37.127 --> 01:19:39.163
The dress is gonna be a hit.

01:19:41.007 --> 01:19:42.963
Hey, I'm gonna go run lines with Sally.

01:19:43.047 --> 01:19:44.241
- Well, don't be long.
- Okay.

01:19:44.327 --> 01:19:45.442
Yeah.

01:20:16.407 --> 01:20:19.001
Mr President,
it's such an honour to have you here.

01:20:19.087 --> 01:20:20.679
Happy to be here.

01:20:55.567 --> 01:20:59.355
"Press here to explode yourself."

01:21:01.927 --> 01:21:05.158
Where's Martin? Where the hell is Martin?
Has anybody seen Martin?

01:21:05.247 --> 01:21:08.398
- He's in there.
- What the hell is he doing in there?

01:21:09.047 --> 01:21:11.607
- What are you doing?
- This isn't pretty.

01:21:11.687 --> 01:21:12.722
What?

01:21:19.447 --> 01:21:22.359
- That's Sally and Mr Tweed?
- Yep.

01:21:31.447 --> 01:21:33.915
- Are you seeing anybody?
- What?

01:21:39.767 --> 01:21:42.156
It looks so much bigger on TV.

01:21:42.607 --> 01:21:44.199
Hey, watch my foot, huh?

01:21:46.807 --> 01:21:50.163
- So, do you feel filthy?
- Not really.

01:21:51.127 --> 01:21:52.685
How do you feel?

01:21:57.807 --> 01:21:59.126
It's weird.

01:22:00.807 --> 01:22:03.605
- I don't actually loathe you.
- You, either.

01:22:16.567 --> 01:22:18.683
Right. The President here yet?

01:22:18.807 --> 01:22:20.877
ANNOUNCER: Yeah!
How you doing, everybody?

01:22:23.927 --> 01:22:26.964
How many Omer fans
do I have with me tonight?

01:22:27.727 --> 01:22:28.842
Yeah!

01:22:30.247 --> 01:22:34.081
And how many Sally fans do I have?
She can hear you in the back!

01:22:37.367 --> 01:22:41.519
ANNOUNCER: And now your host,
Martin Tweed!

01:22:41.647 --> 01:22:43.365
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

01:22:50.407 --> 01:22:52.079
That's Martin Tweed.

01:22:52.967 --> 01:22:55.356
You're looking very good, sir. Very good.

01:22:57.567 --> 01:22:59.876
Welcome, America.

01:23:00.447 --> 01:23:03.439
Welcome, world. Welcome, everyone else.

01:23:04.447 --> 01:23:05.880
- Boo!
- AUDIENCE: Boo!

01:23:09.567 --> 01:23:11.842
We've been through so much together.

01:23:11.927 --> 01:23:15.681
We've laughed. We've cried.
We've formed attachments.

01:23:16.847 --> 01:23:19.315
And now, we're down to just two.

01:23:19.447 --> 01:23:22.803
And to help me help you judge tonight,

01:23:22.887 --> 01:23:25.117
we're welcoming a very special guest.

01:23:25.327 --> 01:23:28.000
The President of this great country,

01:23:28.727 --> 01:23:31.764
President Joseph Staton!

01:23:35.647 --> 01:23:38.002
Thanks for having me on your show.

01:23:47.127 --> 01:23:48.401
So.

01:23:48.487 --> 01:23:51.797
What do you think of these
two great contestants, Mr President?

01:23:52.407 --> 01:23:56.525
I think they exhibit
what's best about America.

01:23:58.447 --> 01:24:01.245
- The spirit of resolve...
- The spirit of resolve

01:24:01.327 --> 01:24:04.637
that makes this
the greatest country in the world.

01:24:06.807 --> 01:24:07.922
They know what they want...

01:24:08.007 --> 01:24:10.362
They know what they want
and they go out and get it.

01:24:10.447 --> 01:24:11.641
All right.

01:24:13.047 --> 01:24:16.164
- I'll be right back!
- Omer! Where are you going?

01:24:22.807 --> 01:24:24.160
(STATIC BUZZING)

01:24:24.967 --> 01:24:27.322
Where's that interference coming from?

01:24:27.607 --> 01:24:29.563
Turn that frigging thing off!

01:24:29.647 --> 01:24:31.877
And turn that frigging thing off!

01:24:33.647 --> 01:24:34.875
Oh!

01:24:43.567 --> 01:24:45.717
Okay. Okay.

01:24:46.807 --> 01:24:49.037
America, Mr President,

01:24:49.367 --> 01:24:54.157
without further ado, let me introduce
America's favourite Middle Eastern import,

01:24:54.807 --> 01:24:57.116
Omer Obeidi!

01:25:20.407 --> 01:25:22.159
Where the hell is he?

01:25:22.287 --> 01:25:24.164
- I don't know where he is...
- I'm going on!

01:25:24.727 --> 01:25:25.762
(STATIC BUZZING)

01:25:34.167 --> 01:25:35.919
SHAZZY: Go, Omer!

01:25:39.287 --> 01:25:41.847
My wife loves this guy.

01:25:44.167 --> 01:25:48.399
(SINGING) And now the end is near

01:25:50.087 --> 01:25:53.363
That's a bad call. That's Frank's song.
People aren't gonna respond to that.

01:25:53.887 --> 01:25:55.605
Bold choice of song.

01:25:56.327 --> 01:25:57.646
My friends

01:25:58.527 --> 01:26:00.597
I'll say it clear

01:26:01.607 --> 01:26:04.075
I'll state my case

01:26:04.527 --> 01:26:07.041
Of which I'm certain

01:26:08.367 --> 01:26:12.724
I've lived a life that's full

01:26:13.647 --> 01:26:15.638
I've travelled each

01:26:16.527 --> 01:26:19.678
And every highway

01:26:20.487 --> 01:26:23.877
But more, much more than this

01:26:23.967 --> 01:26:25.082
(STATIC BUZZING)

01:26:25.167 --> 01:26:26.725
I did it

01:26:27.447 --> 01:26:31.326
My way

01:26:32.767 --> 01:26:37.158
I've loved, I've laughed and cried

01:26:37.807 --> 01:26:39.763
I've had my fill

01:26:39.847 --> 01:26:41.883
Mr President, what are you doing?

01:26:41.967 --> 01:26:43.286
My share of losing

01:26:43.367 --> 01:26:45.927
I'm getting a lot of feedback in this thing.

01:26:46.007 --> 01:26:49.477
And now, as tears subside

01:26:50.087 --> 01:26:52.157
I find it all

01:26:53.247 --> 01:26:55.283
So amusing

01:26:56.687 --> 01:26:58.245
To think

01:26:59.087 --> 01:27:01.362
I did all that

01:27:01.927 --> 01:27:04.316
And may I say

01:27:05.287 --> 01:27:08.279
Not in a shy way

01:27:08.807 --> 01:27:10.320
Oh, no

01:27:11.087 --> 01:27:13.078
Oh, no, not me

01:27:13.647 --> 01:27:15.239
I did it

01:27:15.967 --> 01:27:19.243
My way

01:27:19.487 --> 01:27:22.877
For what is a man?

01:27:23.247 --> 01:27:25.238
What has he got?

01:27:26.207 --> 01:27:29.005
If not himself

01:27:29.207 --> 01:27:30.720
then he has naught

01:27:30.807 --> 01:27:32.684
William Williams, you're a moron.

01:27:33.167 --> 01:27:37.319
A moron. You stupid moron! Stupid moron!

01:27:38.247 --> 01:27:41.319
And not the words

01:27:41.407 --> 01:27:44.524
Of one who kneels

01:27:44.607 --> 01:27:47.167
The record shows

01:27:47.367 --> 01:27:49.801
I took the blows

01:27:50.047 --> 01:27:52.242
And did it

01:27:52.327 --> 01:27:57.082
My way

01:28:02.247 --> 01:28:03.805
I love you, Mom.

01:28:08.607 --> 01:28:10.199
He nailed it!

01:28:11.607 --> 01:28:13.199
That's my cousin!

01:28:13.287 --> 01:28:14.640
(STATIC BUZZING)

01:28:24.367 --> 01:28:25.959
We're gonna stand up.

01:28:37.887 --> 01:28:39.923
Omer, meet the President.

01:28:40.687 --> 01:28:42.120
OMER: Nice to meet you, sir.

01:28:42.207 --> 01:28:43.925
He's talking to him.

01:28:45.607 --> 01:28:48.565
What'd you think of Omer tonight,
Mr President?

01:28:48.807 --> 01:28:50.399
What did I think?

01:28:52.687 --> 01:28:53.915
Mr President?

01:28:54.007 --> 01:28:55.076
What did I think?

01:28:55.167 --> 01:28:57.362
Mr President? Can you read me?

01:28:58.407 --> 01:28:59.840
I think

01:29:03.167 --> 01:29:04.520
I liked you.

01:29:05.127 --> 01:29:06.446
Thank you, sir.

01:29:06.527 --> 01:29:07.960
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

01:29:08.487 --> 01:29:09.806
Go ahead.

01:29:11.327 --> 01:29:12.362
Do it!

01:29:12.447 --> 01:29:14.483
And I just want to say,

01:29:14.847 --> 01:29:16.917
in terms of the Middle East,

01:29:19.007 --> 01:29:22.841
that it looks like the problems over there
are never going to be solved.

01:29:23.727 --> 01:29:24.876
What?

01:29:25.167 --> 01:29:26.441
I mean never.

01:29:27.007 --> 01:29:29.521
Never, never, never, never, never.

01:29:30.687 --> 01:29:31.961
And so,

01:29:34.487 --> 01:29:36.284
I'm sorry about that.

01:29:36.367 --> 01:29:38.835
What the hell was that? I never said that!

01:29:38.927 --> 01:29:40.519
Oh, Poopie.

01:29:45.247 --> 01:29:46.760
Mr President?

01:29:47.727 --> 01:29:49.479
I deeply hope,

01:29:50.327 --> 01:29:52.079
for all of our sakes,

01:29:53.007 --> 01:29:54.406
that you are wrong.

01:29:55.127 --> 01:29:56.640
I hope so, too.

01:29:59.247 --> 01:30:00.680
Nice singing.

01:30:02.847 --> 01:30:03.996
Well...

01:30:04.367 --> 01:30:05.720
On a brighter note,

01:30:05.807 --> 01:30:09.117
we'll be back after a short break
with the enchanting Sally Kendoo.

01:30:09.207 --> 01:30:13.758
And then you all will decide
who is the winner of American Dreamz.

01:30:18.647 --> 01:30:21.241
That's it! Show is over!

01:30:21.327 --> 01:30:23.397
What are you talking about?
There's another contestant.

01:30:23.487 --> 01:30:24.681
Sorry, I'm taking my guy out!

01:30:24.767 --> 01:30:27.486
Your guy, your guy just went
way off reservation!

01:30:27.567 --> 01:30:30.161
Talk about depressing.
Half the audience want to shoot themselves!

01:30:30.247 --> 01:30:31.885
And you, sir, are no Oprah!

01:30:31.967 --> 01:30:34.606
I'd kind of like to see how Sally does.

01:30:34.967 --> 01:30:37.800
All right, you. Where is the you-know-what?

01:30:39.207 --> 01:30:41.846
STAGE MANAGER: And we're back
in three, two.

01:30:41.927 --> 01:30:43.406
Get off the stage! Get off the stage!

01:30:43.487 --> 01:30:44.840
We're back!

01:30:44.927 --> 01:30:48.442
And now all the way from Padookie, Ohio,

01:30:48.567 --> 01:30:52.321
America's newest sweetheart, Sally Kendoo!

01:31:21.447 --> 01:31:24.519
Where the hell is William?
He's supposed to be up here.

01:31:27.727 --> 01:31:31.959
I would like to dedicate this song
to someone very special in the audience,

01:31:32.327 --> 01:31:33.806
my boyfriend.

01:31:34.447 --> 01:31:35.926
William Williams!

01:31:51.127 --> 01:31:52.446
What? No!

01:31:52.807 --> 01:31:55.321
No, he's supposed to propose
after she sings!

01:31:55.407 --> 01:31:57.318
- He's an idiot!
- Yeah.

01:31:58.687 --> 01:32:01.406
Excuse me a moment.
This moron's missed his cue.

01:32:04.007 --> 01:32:06.601
Let's all welcome Sally's sweetheart.

01:32:06.847 --> 01:32:09.566
Decorated war veteran, William Williams!

01:32:13.807 --> 01:32:17.197
I think, perhaps, William has something
he wants to ask Sally.

01:32:18.407 --> 01:32:19.556
Sally?

01:32:21.287 --> 01:32:22.720
Yes, William?

01:32:23.367 --> 01:32:25.403
How could you do this to me?

01:32:29.007 --> 01:32:31.362
How could I do what to you?

01:32:32.647 --> 01:32:35.036
How could you sleep with Mr Tweed?

01:32:35.127 --> 01:32:36.640

01:32:41.927 --> 01:32:42.962
Whoa!

- Boo!
- AUDIENCE: Boo!

01:32:45.007 --> 01:32:46.235
I'm serious.

01:32:47.007 --> 01:32:48.725
Well, seriously, William,

01:32:48.807 --> 01:32:51.082
I think it's common knowledge
I would never ever, ever, ever

01:32:51.167 --> 01:32:53.237
sleep with a contestant
on American Dreamz.

01:32:53.327 --> 01:32:55.397
I saw you through the keyhole.

01:32:58.407 --> 01:32:59.760
He nailed her?

01:33:02.287 --> 01:33:04.642
I guess you two think I'm stupid.

01:33:05.327 --> 01:33:08.000
I guess you all think I'm stupid.

01:33:08.767 --> 01:33:11.327
Well, I'll show you how stupid I am.

01:33:11.887 --> 01:33:15.084
I'm going to blow myself up
with this bomb I found.

01:33:19.447 --> 01:33:22.757
William, don't joke around
about something like that.

01:33:22.847 --> 01:33:24.678
Oh, I am not joking!

01:33:27.087 --> 01:33:28.520
What the fuck?

01:33:28.967 --> 01:33:31.765
Great idea! On-air proposal, Chet Krogl!

01:33:31.887 --> 01:33:33.161
Keep rolling! Keep rolling!

01:33:33.247 --> 01:33:35.715
Get back to your camera!
Get back to your camera!

01:33:35.807 --> 01:33:37.286
Come back! Come back!

01:33:39.167 --> 01:33:40.646
Oh, no.

01:33:48.967 --> 01:33:50.286
Mr Williams?

01:33:50.767 --> 01:33:54.521
Mr Williams, do not do this.
It is not worth it.

01:33:55.247 --> 01:33:57.807
Your death will not solve any problems.

01:33:57.887 --> 01:34:00.879
It'll solve the problem
of me feeling miserable.

01:34:03.047 --> 01:34:05.607
William? I'm the President.

01:34:07.127 --> 01:34:09.004
I know who you are, sir.

01:34:09.647 --> 01:34:11.399
Now, as your Commander in Chief,

01:34:11.567 --> 01:34:14.764
I'm gonna have to ask you
not to blow yourself up.

01:34:16.127 --> 01:34:18.766
Now, I've had dark days myself, William.

01:34:19.407 --> 01:34:23.082
Days where I just wanted to lie in bed
and dream.

01:34:24.327 --> 01:34:25.726
Never get up.

01:34:29.567 --> 01:34:31.797
But I have come to think

01:34:31.967 --> 01:34:34.845
that it is better to deal with reality,

01:34:38.687 --> 01:34:40.837
no matter how unpleasant it is.

01:34:42.647 --> 01:34:44.080
That's my guy.

01:34:50.287 --> 01:34:51.879
No disrespect, sir.

01:34:53.567 --> 01:34:57.003
But if I can't have Sally Kendoo
then I don't want to go on living.

01:35:18.087 --> 01:35:20.317
For all to see

01:35:20.527 --> 01:35:22.483
William! In here.

01:35:22.567 --> 01:35:25.639
Every woman and man

01:35:26.127 --> 01:35:29.164
Has their own destiny

01:35:32.927 --> 01:35:35.964
To dream American Dreamz

01:35:36.407 --> 01:35:38.443
Dreamz with a Z

01:35:38.527 --> 01:35:42.725
To dream American Dreamz

01:35:42.807 --> 01:35:44.798
Dreamz with a Z

01:35:44.887 --> 01:35:49.039
To dream American Dreamz

01:35:49.127 --> 01:35:51.357
Dreamz with a Z

01:35:51.447 --> 01:35:52.516
(STATIC BUZZING)

01:35:52.607 --> 01:35:53.642
(EXPLOSION)

01:35:58.007 --> 01:35:59.486
What happened?

01:36:35.767 --> 01:36:37.962
Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:36:39.007 --> 01:36:41.396
You won this thing. You won it.

01:36:41.487 --> 01:36:42.920
SHAZZY: Where are you going?

01:36:43.007 --> 01:36:45.760
Listen, those three gentlemen right there.
They were the ones with the bombs.

01:36:45.847 --> 01:36:48.520
OMER: You see? Back there, those three.
They were the ones with the bomb.

01:36:56.887 --> 01:36:58.161
Go!

01:37:01.007 --> 01:37:04.204
Mr President! Stop! Stop!

01:37:18.007 --> 01:37:20.567
All right, everyone, please. Please, shut up.

01:37:21.967 --> 01:37:23.400
It's starting.

01:37:24.647 --> 01:37:28.925
SALLY: Last season's finale was
the highest-rated show in television history,

01:37:29.007 --> 01:37:31.202
as my boyfriend, William Williams,

01:37:31.287 --> 01:37:34.438
suffering from hallucinations
caused by posttraumatic stress

01:37:34.527 --> 01:37:36.245
tragically lost his life.

01:37:36.767 --> 01:37:38.564
There was a silver lining, though,

01:37:38.647 --> 01:37:42.037
as he was voted the surprise winner
of American Dreamz.

01:37:42.407 --> 01:37:44.796
I know he would have been so thrilled.

01:37:45.167 --> 01:37:46.759
Fellow runner-up, Omer Obeidi,

01:37:46.847 --> 01:37:50.635
has been touring the country
with a repertory of Broadway hits.

01:37:50.887 --> 01:37:54.163
(SINGING) Go, Greased Lightning
You're burning up the quarter mile

01:37:54.247 --> 01:37:56.477
CHORUS: Greased Lighting
Go, Greased Lighting

01:37:56.567 --> 01:37:59.240
IQBAL: Stop! Stop! Stop!

01:37:59.647 --> 01:38:01.239
This isn't a hoedown!

01:38:01.727 --> 01:38:03.797
SALLY: Special guest judge,
President Staton,

01:38:03.887 --> 01:38:06.447
recently returned
from a Mid-East fact-finding tour

01:38:06.527 --> 01:38:08.165
with his new Chief of Staff.

01:38:08.247 --> 01:38:09.885
You choose first, Poopie.

01:38:10.327 --> 01:38:11.362
(SIGHING)

01:38:11.447 --> 01:38:13.677
I guess I'll go for the newspapers first.

01:38:13.767 --> 01:38:17.919
You take the intelligence reports
and summit briefing and then we'll switch.

01:38:18.007 --> 01:38:21.363
SALLY: And I have
some pretty big shoes to fill.

01:38:21.487 --> 01:38:22.761
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

01:38:23.207 --> 01:38:24.640
Welcome!

01:38:24.887 --> 01:38:28.516
Welcome back to another season
of American Dreamz.

01:38:28.607 --> 01:38:32.486
I am so excited to be your new host,
it's such a dream come true for me.

01:38:33.087 --> 01:38:37.399
And I'd like to dedicate this season
to someone who was very special to us all.

01:38:37.967 --> 01:38:40.527
The great Mr Martin Tweed.

01:38:42.247 --> 01:38:43.600
(AUDIENCE SIGHING)

01:38:44.447 --> 01:38:47.007
We will miss you so very much.

01:38:48.047 --> 01:38:51.198
But now, on to an exciting new season!

01:38:51.287 --> 01:38:53.278
And here are your dreamers!
