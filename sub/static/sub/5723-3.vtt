43:21.200 --> 43:23.475
Uh, no. I...

43:23.525 --> 43:25.725
I just... Can you...

43:25.775 --> 43:28.325
I need you to slow down
and say that again.

43:34.200 --> 43:36.300
Do you know if they're...

43:39.975 --> 43:42.275
Okay.

43:42.325 --> 43:44.125
Okay, I'll try...

43:45.600 --> 43:48.150
Okay. No, I...

43:48.200 --> 43:50.300
I'll call you back.

43:57.075 --> 43:59.625
I'm... I'm so sorry.
I'm gonna have to...

43:59.675 --> 44:02.225
I just found out a friend
of mine was in an accident.

44:02.275 --> 44:04.325
Laurie. Peter.

44:04.375 --> 44:07.975
I'm not kidding, I've been
waiting for this all week.

44:08.025 --> 44:09.475
Ready to come on back?

44:09.525 --> 44:12.150
- Sure.
- Come on. Come on.

44:12.200 --> 44:14.550
Well, Laurie, I should tell you

44:14.600 --> 44:17.525
we almost never accept
unsolicited material,

44:17.575 --> 44:20.750
but Kerry here is the
queen of the slush pile

44:20.800 --> 44:22.375
<i>and she came to me and she said,</i>

44:22.425 --> 44:26.275
"I think I may have just read
the next 'What's Next.'"

44:26.325 --> 44:28.650
You know "What's Next," right?

44:28.700 --> 44:31.275
Patrick Johansen.

44:31.325 --> 44:33.525
Oh, yes. Of course.

44:33.575 --> 44:36.775
Yeah, it was a huge book.
Inspirational.

44:36.825 --> 44:39.325
People wanted to know
how he was able to move on.

44:39.375 --> 44:43.725
And you, you're coming at this
from a completely different angle.

44:43.775 --> 44:47.175
- <i>[phone ringing]</i> - <i>The whole cult
thing from an insider's perspective.</i>

44:47.225 --> 44:49.350
- <i>I love it.</i>
- I'm so sorry.

44:49.400 --> 44:51.625
Let me just put this on silent.

44:51.675 --> 44:54.025
Hey, there's a great alt title.

44:54.075 --> 44:56.175
"Let Me Just Put This On Silent."

44:56.225 --> 44:58.325
[laughs]

44:58.375 --> 45:02.425
So listen, Laurie, as soon
as we have a deal locked in,

45:02.475 --> 45:04.825
I want you and Martin
to sit down together.

45:04.875 --> 45:08.625
He did "What's Next,"
"Departure 3.0."

45:08.675 --> 45:10.350
<i>He's a great editor.</i>

45:10.400 --> 45:12.325
<i>And he's got some terrific ideas.</i>

45:12.375 --> 45:16.675
Help you sharpen the edges.
Get some clarity to it.

45:16.725 --> 45:18.175
Clarity?

45:18.225 --> 45:21.075
Um, yeah. Like the smoking.

45:21.125 --> 45:24.575
You never really explain why they
make you smoke all the time.

45:24.625 --> 45:28.150
Because it was never
really explained to me.

45:28.200 --> 45:32.850
Martin: <i>Yeah, but they
have a story, right?</i>

45:34.625 --> 45:36.150
I don't understand.

45:36.200 --> 45:39.275
A story. A myth.

45:39.325 --> 45:44.150
A rule book that says
do this this way or else.

45:44.200 --> 45:46.425
Like for instance,
the Catholics believe

45:46.475 --> 45:49.175
that Christ died
on the cross for our sins.

45:49.225 --> 45:51.475
The Branch Davidians believe that God

45:51.525 --> 45:54.625
told David Koresh
to fuck his own daughters.

45:54.675 --> 45:56.350
This wing nut in Australia

45:56.400 --> 45:59.375
says that he went to the
other side and he can't die.

45:59.425 --> 46:02.850
We know what the Guilty Remnant does,

46:02.900 --> 46:05.400
but what do they believe?

46:08.200 --> 46:10.250
They believe the world ended.

46:13.500 --> 46:15.275
Okay, all right. All right, great.

46:15.325 --> 46:18.150
So that's... You and
Martin will work on that.

46:18.200 --> 46:21.525
But the bigger issue

46:21.575 --> 46:25.600
is we've got to put
some feeling into this thing.

46:27.025 --> 46:29.550
- Sorry?
- <i>Feeling.</i>

46:29.600 --> 46:31.425
<i>Emotion.</i>

46:31.475 --> 46:34.650
<i>I mean, there's some
heartbreaking stuff in here.</i>

46:36.525 --> 46:38.375
Um...

46:38.425 --> 46:39.525
The lighter.

46:39.575 --> 46:41.725
[snaps fingers] The lighter.

46:41.775 --> 46:43.575
<i>From your daughter</i>

46:43.625 --> 46:47.125
<i>with the engraving
"Please come home, Mom."</i>

46:47.175 --> 46:49.575
It said "Don't forget me."

46:49.625 --> 46:50.875
Even better.

46:50.925 --> 46:54.925
See, Laurie, that's what
this book wants to be.

46:54.975 --> 46:56.950
If you want people
to connect with it,

46:57.000 --> 46:59.250
you have to tell them how it felt.

46:59.300 --> 47:02.025
How what felt?

47:02.075 --> 47:04.675
The realization.

47:04.725 --> 47:06.125
When you figured out
that these people

47:06.175 --> 47:09.050
that you left your family for
are fucking whack jobs.

47:10.700 --> 47:13.650
<i>[stammers] Okay.</i>

47:13.700 --> 47:15.925
<i>Oh, your daughter, um...</i>

47:15.975 --> 47:18.225
- Jill.
- <i>Jill, yes.</i>

47:18.275 --> 47:20.275
<i>The fire.</i>

47:20.325 --> 47:23.525
<i>My God, when I read that,
I couldn't believe it.</i>

47:23.575 --> 47:25.375
<i>But the fact-checkers
said you were there.</i>

47:25.425 --> 47:30.125
<i>And Jill, she was there because these
people had you brainwashed, right?</i>

47:30.175 --> 47:33.275
Then they got you to let your
own daughter into the house

47:33.325 --> 47:35.150
so that you would burn together.

47:35.200 --> 47:38.250
<i>But then you break free.</i>

47:38.300 --> 47:40.225
<i>And when you finally speak</i>

47:40.275 --> 47:43.425
<i>for the first time in,
what was it, a year,</i>

47:43.475 --> 47:45.950
<i>you shout Jill's name
to your husband,</i>

47:46.000 --> 47:48.975
<i>the same guy these people
made you divorce.</i>

47:49.025 --> 47:51.525
<i>And he goes running in.</i>

47:51.575 --> 47:54.950
<i>I mean, she's in there
because of you.</i>

47:55.000 --> 47:58.150
<i>But you can't save her.</i>

47:58.200 --> 48:00.275
<i>He's the one to save her</i>

48:00.325 --> 48:04.125
<i>because all you can do
is stand there and watch.</i>

48:04.175 --> 48:07.725
And I know all of this, Laurie,
because you put it in your book.

48:07.775 --> 48:11.250
<i>But what I don't know, Laurie,
and what I need to know...</i>

48:12.925 --> 48:15.050
<i>is how you feel about it.</i>

48:22.000 --> 48:25.125
[screaming]

48:32.700 --> 48:35.050
<i>[door buzzes]</i>

48:39.400 --> 48:41.450
Officer: <i>Garvey.</i>

49:01.425 --> 49:03.550
They like my book.

49:11.425 --> 49:14.025
[crying]

49:40.200 --> 49:43.850
What she did, it wasn't our fault.

49:44.975 --> 49:47.725
She was fucked up, Mom. We tried.

49:49.025 --> 49:51.400
They won't jump out of the way.

49:53.500 --> 49:55.275
- What?
- I don't want to hurt them,

49:55.325 --> 49:58.225
but they won't jump out of the way.

50:02.500 --> 50:06.750
Mom, I know you're fucked up,

50:06.800 --> 50:08.975
but everyone's back
at our place right now

50:09.025 --> 50:12.325
and they're all losing their shit.

50:12.375 --> 50:14.925
So can you keep yours together?

50:19.275 --> 50:21.950
Why are we losing?

50:22.000 --> 50:24.425
Because they're giving
them something.

50:24.475 --> 50:27.675
We can strip it away,
but once it's gone,

50:27.725 --> 50:30.925
we have nothing to put
back in its place.

50:38.175 --> 50:40.750
Well, let's give them something.

50:47.300 --> 50:50.350
Laurie: <i>Therapists
have a lot of rules.</i>

50:50.400 --> 50:53.025
Only one really matters:

50:53.075 --> 50:54.900
<i>don't talk about yourself.</i>

50:57.800 --> 51:01.025
I spent the first weeks
after the Departure

51:01.075 --> 51:04.225
just waiting.

51:05.775 --> 51:07.875
I'm still waiting.

51:07.925 --> 51:10.325
We all are.

51:12.225 --> 51:14.950
I had a patient who said she could

51:15.000 --> 51:18.725
feel that something
terrible was gonna happen.

51:18.775 --> 51:21.175
And it did.

51:21.225 --> 51:24.250
So the next time I saw her
a few months later,

51:24.300 --> 51:29.050
she was wearing white,
smoking a cigarette.

51:29.100 --> 51:32.125
She knew I was afraid

51:32.175 --> 51:36.525
and confused and alone.

51:38.925 --> 51:43.150
And the next thing I knew, I was
screaming my daughter's name

51:43.200 --> 51:45.650
thinking that I had killed her.

51:53.100 --> 51:55.500
Her name is Jill.

51:57.500 --> 52:00.500
And I don't think she'll
ever speak to me again.

52:09.025 --> 52:10.975
But there is another story.

52:11.025 --> 52:13.125
[sniffles]

52:13.175 --> 52:15.725
It's one that I've kept to myself

52:15.775 --> 52:17.875
because I had to

52:17.925 --> 52:20.325
to protect my son.

52:23.775 --> 52:25.650
Tell them.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.100
Tell them, Tommy.

52:31.500 --> 52:33.225
<i>They need you to.</i>

52:42.575 --> 52:45.075
Have you heard of Holy Wayne?

52:45.125 --> 52:47.225
Yeah.

52:47.275 --> 52:50.250
He said he could
take people's pain away.

52:50.300 --> 52:51.850
I didn't believe him at first,

52:51.900 --> 52:54.125
but then I saw him do it.

52:54.175 --> 52:57.550
He would just hug them
and they'd be okay.

53:00.975 --> 53:02.775
I don't know why,

53:02.825 --> 53:06.525
I don't know why him,
but I know it worked.

53:07.575 --> 53:09.825
So I followed him wherever he went

53:09.875 --> 53:13.025
and I did whatever he asked of me.

53:13.075 --> 53:15.300
And then they came to kill him.

53:18.700 --> 53:22.175
<i>We got away, but we had to split up.</i>

53:22.225 --> 53:24.825
<i>He asked me to protect this girl,</i>

53:24.875 --> 53:27.400
a pregnant girl.

53:29.025 --> 53:31.750
She gave birth...

53:31.800 --> 53:34.350
and then she just left the baby.

53:34.400 --> 53:38.325
Just abandoned it in a
fucking rest stop bathroom.

53:38.375 --> 53:40.925
The baby, she was crying
and I didn't know what to do.

53:40.975 --> 53:42.950
I was alone.

53:44.525 --> 53:46.725
<i>So I looked up at the ceiling</i>

53:46.775 --> 53:48.800
and said, "Help."

53:49.925 --> 53:51.925
Not to God.

53:51.975 --> 53:54.500
Not to anyone. I just said it.

53:57.975 --> 54:01.550
10 seconds later, there's
a knock on the door.

54:03.775 --> 54:06.550
It was Wayne.

54:06.600 --> 54:09.050
<i>I don't know how he found me.</i>

54:09.100 --> 54:11.875
Nobody knew where I was.

54:11.925 --> 54:14.625
The baby stopped crying and...

54:16.200 --> 54:18.150
he told me where to take her.

54:18.200 --> 54:20.900
She'd be safe.

54:22.200 --> 54:24.600
And then he said he was gonna die.

54:26.275 --> 54:28.525
Yeah.

54:28.575 --> 54:32.400
I asked him when
and he said tomorrow.

54:34.125 --> 54:37.550
I asked him why he wasn't afraid.

54:37.600 --> 54:39.525
And he said,

54:39.575 --> 54:42.650
"I haven't been afraid
in a real long time."

54:45.875 --> 54:48.500
Then he told me one more thing.

54:50.200 --> 54:54.675
He said if I accepted it,
that I could do what he did.

54:54.725 --> 54:57.000
I could take people's pain away.

54:58.775 --> 55:01.000
But there'd be a price.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.725
There's always a price, though.

55:06.075 --> 55:08.875
But I wanted it anyway.

55:08.925 --> 55:11.475
I wanted to do what he could do.

55:11.525 --> 55:14.375
I wanted to be...

55:14.425 --> 55:16.000
something.

55:19.025 --> 55:21.425
So I said yes.

55:24.125 --> 55:28.550
And he wrapped his arms around me

55:28.600 --> 55:31.775
and I felt everything I was,

55:31.825 --> 55:35.175
everything I ever would be.

55:35.225 --> 55:39.775
And I felt it get born and die

55:39.825 --> 55:43.250
over and over again.

55:44.975 --> 55:47.875
And then he let go.

55:47.925 --> 55:50.450
[crying]

55:50.500 --> 55:53.375
I'm sorry.

55:53.425 --> 55:56.650
I'm so sorry.

55:57.800 --> 55:59.650
I've been afraid to use it.

56:01.600 --> 56:04.450
Been afraid of what it was.

56:06.325 --> 56:09.125
Of what it would become.

56:09.175 --> 56:11.850
But I can't let you hurt anymore.

56:15.200 --> 56:17.800
I can't be afraid anymore.

56:23.975 --> 56:26.025
So...

56:37.125 --> 56:39.725
who wants a hug?
