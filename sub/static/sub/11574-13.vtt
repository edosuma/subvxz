WEBVTT

00:06.716 --> 00:09.207
Thank you for the car.

00:09.302 --> 00:10.792
She's not the best on gas,

00:10.887 --> 00:14.721
but she'll get you from
A to B and hit on.

00:14.807 --> 00:17.970
Mostly by guys in
cheese grater hats but...

00:18.060 --> 00:19.516
--Got it.
--Oh, and speaking of gas,

00:19.604 --> 00:22.596
for some reason, when you go over
sixty clicks, it starts to smell like gas.

00:22.690 --> 00:28.686
So, you might want to make frequent
stops to... to well, avoid brain damage.

00:28.779 --> 00:30.315
Maybe we should just take the bus.

00:30.406 --> 00:33.148
No. Sorry, it's, uh...

00:34.952 --> 00:37.034
It's okay, really.

00:39.624 --> 00:42.161
Be careful on the road, okay?

00:45.463 --> 00:46.452
All set?

00:46.547 --> 00:49.539
Okay. One sec, sweetie.

00:51.469 --> 00:55.587
Well, have fun and let me know
if you need anything, okay?

00:55.681 --> 00:57.888
Anything at all.

00:57.975 --> 01:01.263
I'm not going to call
you while I'm gone.

01:01.354 --> 01:03.345
And I don't want you to call me either.

01:03.439 --> 01:05.896
Why does it feel like I'm
never going to see you again?

01:05.983 --> 01:08.816
You will, Bo.

01:08.903 --> 01:11.235
l have your car.

01:14.533 --> 01:18.151
I am coming back, for good.

01:18.246 --> 01:21.113
l've recommitted myself to the Ash.

01:21.207 --> 01:22.287
What?

01:22.375 --> 01:27.335
He saved Nadia's life.
I owe him everything.

01:30.675 --> 01:33.291
Thank you, again.

01:33.386 --> 01:34.842
Yeah.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.553
[LAUREN] Right, we're off.

01:44.438 --> 01:50.024
I said, "I'll be thrilled to work
a double shift tomorrow, Marcus.

01:50.111 --> 01:56.027
Just so long as you don't mind taking
a long, hard swig off my backside."

01:56.117 --> 02:01.828
Yeah, twenty-five years I've been
at the Royal Celtic Museum,

02:01.914 --> 02:03.029
and who do you think's responsible

02:03.124 --> 02:05.866
for keeping the artefacts
and the artwork safe?

02:05.960 --> 02:11.830
Marcus, from his office on
the fifth floor or you-know-who?

02:11.924 --> 02:16.509
Going to march in there today
and give him a piece of my mind.

02:22.059 --> 02:25.347
Burn air, you could!

02:25.438 --> 02:27.474
Fat slag.

02:29.358 --> 02:31.895
My mother was right.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.992
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

02:46.083 --> 02:48.995
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

02:49.086 --> 02:51.998
My love carries a death sentence.

02:52.089 --> 02:54.171
l was lost for years,

02:54.258 --> 02:56.920
searching, while hiding,

02:57.011 --> 03:01.175
only to find that I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

03:01.265 --> 03:06.134
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

03:11.817 --> 03:13.682
[cell phone ringing]

03:18.908 --> 03:20.523
Chain letter?

03:20.618 --> 03:22.609
Oh, something like that.

03:22.703 --> 03:25.695
So, what's on the books
for today, booby-cakes?

03:25.790 --> 03:27.872
Well, Trick asked me to drop by.

03:27.958 --> 03:29.949
But then I was hoping that you
and I could put our heads together

03:30.044 --> 03:31.955
and find a way inside
the Ash's compound.

03:32.046 --> 03:33.832
--Panty raid?
--Nope.

03:33.923 --> 03:36.585
I'm going to force-feed Lachlan
a buffet of right-hand burritos

03:36.675 --> 03:37.926
and stiletto-boot tacos.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.170
Mm, those sound delish.

03:39.261 --> 03:41.673
They do, don't they?
And the sun is shining.

03:41.764 --> 03:46.178
Does Bo want to tell the class why
it is she's planning on starting a war?

03:46.268 --> 03:48.645
Because that unbelievable
dickwad, Lachlan,

03:48.729 --> 03:51.641
somehow tricked Lauren into
recommitting herself to the Light Fae.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.142
--What?
--And I'm going to choke the Lucky Charms

03:53.234 --> 03:54.690
right out of his purple little heart.

03:54.777 --> 03:55.732
How'd he do that?

03:55.820 --> 03:57.185
You want to know how he did that?

03:57.279 --> 03:58.735
Yeah.

03:59.532 --> 04:00.692
Okay.

04:00.783 --> 04:05.527
See, he tried to, like, he...

04:05.621 --> 04:08.408
Just because Lauren
thinks that he's... umm...

04:08.499 --> 04:13.243
See, because he helped
wake Nadia, it's like she--

04:13.337 --> 04:17.125
Actually, I don't really want
to get into it, Kenzi, okay?

04:17.216 --> 04:19.753
Yeah, I thought you might not.

04:19.844 --> 04:22.927
You know, I let myself
trust him, you know?

04:23.013 --> 04:25.720
One of these days, I'm going
to stop being so naive

04:25.808 --> 04:27.969
and when that day comes, I'm gonna--

04:28.060 --> 04:31.302
--You know what I'm gonna do?
--What are you gonna do?

04:31.397 --> 04:33.353
Sleep in.

04:33.441 --> 04:35.853
Oh, honey, come here.

04:35.943 --> 04:39.060
You know, trusting
someone ain't so bad, right?

04:39.155 --> 04:43.068
I mean, it's better to trust
and lose than never trust at all.

04:43.159 --> 04:45.741
Who are you and what
have you done with Kenzi?

04:45.828 --> 04:46.863
Huh?

04:46.954 --> 04:50.196
--Wait, what is that?
--No, no, no, no, no, no.

04:51.375 --> 04:53.286
"Still pretty?

04:53.377 --> 04:57.666
I haven't laughed like that since the
last time you made me laugh like that.

04:57.756 --> 05:02.796
Wait! How long until sushi goes bad,
my mom wants to know?

05:02.887 --> 05:04.002
Want to hang today?"

05:04.096 --> 05:07.213
I know. He's a total stalker, right?

05:07.308 --> 05:09.424
--You love him.
--No, I don't.

05:09.518 --> 05:10.724
You love Nate.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.017
No.

05:12.104 --> 05:15.221
Oh my god, you totally got some.

05:15.316 --> 05:16.180
Oh, honey, please.

05:16.275 --> 05:18.061
It takes a lot more than a
blooper into shallow right

05:18.152 --> 05:19.437
to get past first base with me.

05:19.528 --> 05:21.860
Okay, you have to work for this.

05:21.947 --> 05:24.563
You know what, Kenzi?
I think I'm going to fly solo today.

05:24.658 --> 05:25.443
Bo, don't.

05:25.534 --> 05:26.990
No, honestly. I got this.

05:27.077 --> 05:29.784
You just have a great day hanging
out with your new boyfriend.

05:29.872 --> 05:31.032
Boyfriend?

05:31.123 --> 05:34.160
Two words, succubus--boob punch!

05:34.251 --> 05:36.116
[BO] Bye, Kenzi.

05:37.213 --> 05:40.751
If you get hurt going after
Lachlan alone, so help me--

05:42.718 --> 05:45.004
Hey, remember I said
I got to go help Trick?

05:45.095 --> 05:49.589
Now, | find it so strange that a
high-ranking Light Fae police detective

05:49.683 --> 05:53.096
spends so much of his time
running errands for a bartender.

05:53.187 --> 05:55.018
You haven't seen my tab.

05:55.105 --> 05:56.811
Oh my god.

05:58.275 --> 05:59.185
What's so funny?

05:59.276 --> 06:03.895
What in the name of
all that's holy... is this?

06:03.989 --> 06:06.731
Uh, my favourite T-shirt, obviously.

06:06.825 --> 06:09.362
Right. Well, no, there's no way

06:09.453 --> 06:13.867
I'm living in a house with a man who
has his partner's face on a T-shirt.

06:13.958 --> 06:15.494
It's just... It's just weird.

06:15.584 --> 06:19.372
Really? Well, I guess
I'm not moving in then.

06:19.463 --> 06:20.578
What?

06:20.673 --> 06:22.914
T-shirt's a deal-breaker, babe.

06:25.719 --> 06:31.430
Do you really want to do this?
You know, move in and play house?

06:31.517 --> 06:34.554
Yes. Yes, I do.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.519
Excellent.

06:41.610 --> 06:48.357
Well, in that case, I guess you won't
really, really be needing this.

06:48.450 --> 06:50.281
So, I will just--

06:50.369 --> 06:51.279
What are you doing?

06:51.370 --> 06:52.951
No, I think l have to.

06:53.038 --> 06:55.780
--You're asking for trouble.
--Bye.

06:55.874 --> 06:57.489
Oh, you're so dead.

07:00.462 --> 07:01.668
Hey.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.131
If I murder the Ash,

07:03.215 --> 07:06.127
do we have another stag hunt or
does the job just go directly to Hale?

07:06.218 --> 07:09.005
I am hoping this is merely
a hypothetical exercise.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.461
He lied to me, Trick.

07:10.556 --> 07:11.921
And what's worse is that he used me

07:12.016 --> 07:15.679
to force Lauren into giving her
life over to the Light Fae again.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.179
--What?
--Nothing for nothing.

07:17.271 --> 07:21.514
But he deserves a good, swift kick
to the zipper part of his pants.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.975
And there's nothing I'd
like more than to help you.

07:24.069 --> 07:25.730
Unfortunately, your
timing couldn't be worse.

07:25.821 --> 07:27.607
See, I knew you would
say something like that.

07:27.698 --> 07:29.154
Tonight is the blood moon.

07:29.241 --> 07:31.618
--What?
--Every twenty years or so,

07:31.702 --> 07:36.571
on this night, I can go into a
trance and divine the future.

07:36.665 --> 07:39.953
I want to look at this evil that's
coming. See what we're up against.

07:40.044 --> 07:41.705
Well, what kind of a trance?

07:41.795 --> 07:42.910
Is it dangerous?

07:43.005 --> 07:45.291
It can be. In particular, for me.

07:45.382 --> 07:47.498
But not if I have the right ring.

07:47.593 --> 07:50.050
The Kingmoor Ring.

07:50.137 --> 07:53.095
These rings possess
the charmed abilities

07:53.182 --> 07:55.548
of the material from which they came.

07:55.643 --> 07:58.760
And I can't complete
the ritual without this one.

07:58.854 --> 08:00.515
|t'll staunch the bleeding.

08:00.606 --> 08:02.688
Bleeding?

08:02.775 --> 08:04.231
Trick are you crazy?

08:04.318 --> 08:06.309
Maybe.

08:06.403 --> 08:09.190
I need you to forget
about Lachlan for now.

08:09.281 --> 08:13.365
For now, I need you to
get me the Kingmoor ring.

08:13.452 --> 08:14.942
My life could depend on it.

08:15.037 --> 08:17.744
Of course. Where do | find it?

08:17.831 --> 08:20.243
It's usually kept at
the Royal Celtic Museum.

08:20.334 --> 08:23.076
You want me to break into
a museum and steal a ring for you?

08:23.170 --> 08:26.207
No. I already stole it.

08:26.298 --> 08:28.459
I didn't steal it myself.
I paid someone else to.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.461
Oh, good.

08:30.552 --> 08:31.928
A shifter named Teague.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.389
He just flew in from
England with the ring.

08:34.473 --> 08:38.807
Greedy bastard wants more money,
but I don't have time to renegotiate.

08:38.894 --> 08:41.806
I'd go myself, but I have
to go see an old friend

08:41.897 --> 08:44.388
about a hallucinogen for the trance.

08:44.483 --> 08:47.225
Hallucinogen? Like the
magic mushroomy kind?

08:47.319 --> 08:52.063
Barometz. It's a plant,
it's also part sheep.

08:52.157 --> 08:56.821
You grind the bones, boil the blood,
inhale the smoke, and have a vision.

08:56.912 --> 08:58.823
Of plant-sheep being slaughtered?

08:58.914 --> 09:00.529
Bo, this is serious.

09:00.624 --> 09:03.457
The side effect of the
Barometz is severe bleeding.

09:03.544 --> 09:05.705
Without the ring, I could bleed out.

09:05.796 --> 09:08.003
And at the risk of sounding dramatic,

09:08.090 --> 09:11.958
this may be the only chance we have
to find out what's headed our way.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.338
After tonight, it'll be too late.

09:16.724 --> 09:19.136
--You ready to go, Trick?
--Just about.

09:21.729 --> 09:24.937
This is the payment we agreed upon.

09:25.023 --> 09:26.103
Wow!

09:26.191 --> 09:29.524
Don't ever let Kenzi know
you're hiding gold bricks in here.

09:29.611 --> 09:32.603
If you wouldn't mind
using your special talents

09:32.698 --> 09:35.656
to get him to rethink
his current position,

09:35.743 --> 09:38.735
I'd be eternally grateful.
As would all Faekind.

09:38.829 --> 09:39.693
Sure.

09:39.788 --> 09:43.030
And watch your back.
This Teague can't be trusted.

09:43.125 --> 09:46.242
A shifty shifter? Got it.

09:46.336 --> 09:48.122
Oh, god.

09:51.842 --> 09:53.878
I'll just lay the boots to Lachlan later.

09:53.969 --> 09:55.425
Bye, guys.

10:21.538 --> 10:24.951
Didn't anyone ever tell you
it's not polite to stare?

10:32.883 --> 10:35.795
Wow! I clean up nice.

10:37.262 --> 10:38.718
I take it back.

10:42.392 --> 10:46.635
I am guessing that you were sent
here to hasten the negotiations.

10:46.730 --> 10:50.689
I am just not used to looking in the
mirror and seeing myself so full of crap.

10:52.861 --> 10:55.728
I don't think it's necessary to insult me.

10:55.823 --> 10:58.189
I am a man of business, nothing more.

10:58.283 --> 11:00.740
Well, let me ask you a question, man.

11:00.828 --> 11:03.285
Besides screwing people over
and going back on your word,

11:03.372 --> 11:06.830
if you had to go to the bathroom
right now, would you pee sitting down?

11:08.252 --> 11:11.836
I am going to take what is
finally owed to me, okay?

11:11.922 --> 11:15.039
No more Mister Ten Percent.
This is my chance.

11:17.636 --> 11:19.922
And stealing this?

11:20.013 --> 11:21.844
No. No.

11:21.932 --> 11:24.344
l have used my talents
to make people rich

11:24.434 --> 11:27.050
and all I've gotten in return
is a bloody identity crisis.

11:27.145 --> 11:29.761
When I look in the mirror,
I don't even see my face!

11:29.857 --> 11:31.017
My real face!

11:31.108 --> 11:37.695
| see celebrities and security guards
and policemen and bank tellers.

11:39.533 --> 11:43.446
l have made myself
a ghost for people like you.

11:43.537 --> 11:45.994
So, if finally getting out of the game

11:46.081 --> 11:50.541
means that l have to become you
for long enough to rob Trick blind,

11:50.627 --> 11:52.242
so be it!

11:52.337 --> 11:54.828
Before you walk around
pretending to be me,

11:54.923 --> 11:56.504
there's something you should know.

11:56.592 --> 11:58.423
Oh, yeah?

11:58.510 --> 12:00.375
And what might that be?

12:03.599 --> 12:05.760
Looks can be deceiving.

12:24.995 --> 12:26.280
Sorry, pal.

12:26.371 --> 12:30.614
But hey, you're one
step closer to retirement.

12:53.565 --> 12:57.524
I once had a boyfriend who wore
sandalwood behind his ears.

12:57.611 --> 12:59.272
Is that you, Fitzy?

12:59.363 --> 13:00.569
Hello, Wai Lin.

13:00.656 --> 13:02.692
Such a happy coincidence.

13:02.783 --> 13:05.991
l was just thinking of the time
we made love in the rain.

13:06.078 --> 13:12.574
With the eyes of the entire Terracotta
Army upon our writhing, naked bodies.

13:12.668 --> 13:15.455
She was much prettier
before she got into drugs.

13:15.545 --> 13:16.671
Hey, man, no one's judging.

13:16.755 --> 13:19.462
Yeah, play on, player.

13:19.549 --> 13:22.632
Have you policemen come to raid me?

13:22.719 --> 13:28.965
No. We actually just came to see
if you had a Mogwai to sell.

13:30.686 --> 13:32.768
We're here for the Barometz.

13:33.939 --> 13:35.145
Oh, what--

13:35.232 --> 13:37.473
Wai Lin is Luduan.

13:37.567 --> 13:40.274
She'll find the truth, so there's
no point in lying to her.

13:41.989 --> 13:46.824
And it would be in your best interest
to take your hand off that shotgun, Lin.

13:46.910 --> 13:49.322
|f Dyson so much as suspects foul play,

13:49.413 --> 13:53.747
he'll tear your throat out before Hale can
finish whistling your brain into a soup.

13:53.834 --> 13:56.166
Touchy. Touchy.

14:00.632 --> 14:03.624
You know what I've come for
and I don't have time to waste.

14:03.719 --> 14:08.008
Sure, sure. But Barometz has a price.

14:08.098 --> 14:13.013
Four questions, four true
answers freely given.

14:13.103 --> 14:16.846
One vial of Barometz bones. Yes?

14:17.983 --> 14:19.348
Ag reed.

14:19.443 --> 14:20.899
Wonderful.

14:21.778 --> 14:23.769
[knocking]

14:23.864 --> 14:26.856
| just found something really weird.

14:26.950 --> 14:28.315
Oh, like, on your person?

14:28.410 --> 14:30.116
Oh, no.

14:39.254 --> 14:44.374
P Dear new older boy,
Hello, my name is Kenzi P

14:44.468 --> 14:46.880
D And | live next door to you P

14:46.970 --> 14:49.256
P That's right next door directly P

14:49.347 --> 14:54.091
D And |-|-|-|-| like ponies and I
like milk more than I like juice P

14:54.186 --> 14:57.303
--Stop it.
--Stop it. You're going to ruin it.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.809
P So if you like some
of those things too D

14:59.900 --> 15:02.312
P Yeah, yeah, just like I do P

15:02.402 --> 15:09.069
P Then one day do you think
that I might play with you... P

15:09.159 --> 15:10.194
Oh my god.

15:10.285 --> 15:13.903
I know. You wrote that
for me when you were six.

15:13.997 --> 15:14.827
Isn't it sweet?

15:14.915 --> 15:18.499
No. I mean oh my god,
you are such a psycho.

15:18.585 --> 15:21.668
--What! Why?
--Because you still have this.

15:21.755 --> 15:25.213
What, do you just, like, carry it around
with you and pretend to not be crazy?

15:25.300 --> 15:28.963
Kenz, I didn't know that I had it.
It was in a box of old notebooks

15:29.054 --> 15:33.013
and I came across it last night
when l was going over old songs.

15:33.100 --> 15:38.561
You know, and I think that
we should jam it out together.

15:38.647 --> 15:43.892
Listen, Bo is on a job and
I'm really worried about her.

15:43.985 --> 15:47.773
So, maybe this isn't the best time to
finish the "ponies are awesome" song.

15:47.864 --> 15:51.527
Kenzi, can I tell you
something, important?

15:51.618 --> 15:54.200
Sure.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.868
D And |-|-|-|-| like ponies P

15:55.956 --> 15:58.197
D And I like milk more
than I likejuice... P

15:58.291 --> 16:02.079
All right. If you're sticking around, I am
definitely going to need some coffee.

16:02.170 --> 16:05.253
P Hey new older boy P

16:05.340 --> 16:08.127
Or maybe a shot of whiskey.

16:08.218 --> 16:10.379
--Kenzi?
--Yeah?

16:10.470 --> 16:12.006
You are so pretty.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.437
1419.

16:22.524 --> 16:27.314
We were onboard a Song Dynasty
junk ship heading to the Americas.

16:27.404 --> 16:30.271
--Lin--
--You were carrying a box.

16:33.243 --> 16:36.235
What was inside that box?

16:36.329 --> 16:39.492
You know I can't tell you that.
Just like I couldn't tell you then.

16:39.583 --> 16:41.414
I want to know!

16:41.501 --> 16:43.492
I demand to know!

16:44.838 --> 16:47.295
Don't make me force you to talk.

16:50.802 --> 16:56.047
Oh, sure, you're almighty Blood King.

16:56.141 --> 16:58.302
Maybe you are immune to my powers.

16:58.393 --> 17:02.261
Or maybe no one is
immune to the truth.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.391
You want to try your luck?

17:08.278 --> 17:09.734
Blood King?

17:11.990 --> 17:15.107
In the box was the skull
of a very dangerous man.

17:15.202 --> 17:18.490
I will not say who or
where it was buried.

17:18.580 --> 17:20.741
And if you try and force me to tell you,

17:20.832 --> 17:23.494
I will give Dyson permission
to use whatever force necessary

17:23.585 --> 17:26.793
to make sure those fingernails
click their last clack.

17:29.299 --> 17:33.793
Your wife, she died. How?

17:33.887 --> 17:37.971
She was killed during
the Great Fae War.

17:39.059 --> 17:40.595
Her throat...

17:42.229 --> 17:45.016
Her throat was slit in battle.

17:45.106 --> 17:47.768
Barometz, Lin. Now!

18:00.538 --> 18:03.200
Of course, I am owed
one more question,

18:03.291 --> 18:07.000
since you wouldn't give me
the truth about the box.

18:07.087 --> 18:11.751
Was it your fault that your wife died?

18:11.841 --> 18:17.802
|f| had opened my veins sooner to
write the laws that brought us peace,

18:17.889 --> 18:20.676
maybe she'd still be alive.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.723
Still be with me.

18:24.312 --> 18:26.689
But I didn't.

18:26.773 --> 18:29.560
If that means it's my fault,
then so be it.

18:35.282 --> 18:37.147
Hey, pretty boy.

18:38.159 --> 18:42.698
If you ever want a good time of sex,
you give me a call, okay?

18:42.789 --> 18:45.121
I'm sad to say I am spoken for.

18:45.208 --> 18:48.541
Ah, no fair. You love her?

18:50.213 --> 18:52.750
I said do you love her?

18:52.841 --> 18:55.048
I can't love Ciara.

19:05.729 --> 19:08.687
Hope this little trinket
does what you say it will.

19:16.156 --> 19:18.522
--Thank you.
--Look, Trick,

19:18.616 --> 19:21.949
if bleeding is a side effect of this
trance, why are you going under?

19:22.037 --> 19:24.369
Why not Dyson or Hale?

19:24.456 --> 19:26.947
It seems kind of risky, you know, for...

19:27.042 --> 19:29.875
...for someone like yourself,
you know, considering.

19:29.961 --> 19:34.830
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Bo knows, too?

19:34.924 --> 19:36.175
Wow.

19:36.259 --> 19:40.673
I'm the only one who can manipulate
the Barometz vision to divine the future.

19:40.764 --> 19:42.254
At the risk of bleeding to death.

19:42.349 --> 19:46.342
I understand your concern,
but it has to be me.

19:52.984 --> 19:54.895
--Hey.
--Hey.

19:54.986 --> 19:56.692
You okay?

19:56.780 --> 19:58.270
Yeah, I'm fine.

20:02.160 --> 20:05.994
So, have fun in the future.

20:06.081 --> 20:09.665
Bo. I need you to leave Lachlan be.

20:09.751 --> 20:12.959
The last thing we need to do is
alienate our most powerful ally.

20:13.046 --> 20:14.877
And the compound is locked tight.

20:14.964 --> 20:17.125
Not to mention, me and
Dyson are kind of legally bound

20:17.217 --> 20:19.503
to alert the Ash whenever
there's a threat made on his life.

20:19.594 --> 20:20.754
Well, would you change
your mind if you knew

20:20.845 --> 20:23.131
Lachlan was this nasty
thing coming our way?

20:23.223 --> 20:24.554
We'll know soon enough.

20:24.641 --> 20:26.347
Until then, he's innocent.

20:26.434 --> 20:27.810
Well, I could go over there right now

20:27.894 --> 20:30.010
and prove that this
son of a bitch is pure evil.

20:30.105 --> 20:33.017
Bo, you can't just charge in there
with your head down swinging.

20:33.108 --> 20:34.689
There's too much at stake.

20:34.776 --> 20:38.143
I'm telling you to stand down!

20:42.784 --> 20:44.615
I'll leave it alone.

20:50.667 --> 20:54.910
Well, since I have suddenly found
myself with a quiet night in,

20:55.004 --> 20:56.835
would you mind if I borrowed
some light reading?

20:56.923 --> 20:58.459
Take anything you like.

21:15.817 --> 21:17.728
Happy hunting.

21:17.819 --> 21:19.525
Thank you.

21:32.292 --> 21:35.625
Uh huh. I think that
someone just had a lot of fun.

21:35.712 --> 21:38.249
Oh. It was okay.

21:38.339 --> 21:41.706
Well, then let's trade for a little bit.

21:42.886 --> 21:45.844
Or we could...

21:47.348 --> 21:50.590
...do this together.

21:50.685 --> 21:53.176
l have a ninja sword, you know.

21:53.271 --> 21:54.727
Uh huh.

22:06.493 --> 22:10.361
I'm leaving tomorrow, Kenzi.

22:15.418 --> 22:17.033
Of course.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.085
Kenzi!

22:20.173 --> 22:22.880
Yeah, well, that is your M.O. right,

22:22.967 --> 22:26.380
leaving without a trace
without saying goodbye?

22:26.471 --> 22:27.836
It's not like that.

22:27.931 --> 22:30.889
There wasn't a day that went by
that I didn't think of you

22:30.975 --> 22:33.352
and wonder if I'd ever see you again.

22:33.436 --> 22:35.097
God, I'm so stupid.

22:35.188 --> 22:36.849
And all that is true.

22:36.940 --> 22:38.601
Did you ever have a job
writing Hallmark cards?

22:38.691 --> 22:40.227
--Kenzi!
--Because you should.

22:40.318 --> 22:42.400
You got some really
good lines, hombre.

22:42.487 --> 22:44.978
And I want you to come with me.

22:47.075 --> 22:49.441
What?

22:49.536 --> 22:51.322
I got some gigs coming up.

22:51.412 --> 22:55.872
Nothing big, but they're
out of town and l was hoping...

22:55.959 --> 22:59.451
...that you would come with me.

22:59.546 --> 23:03.334
Look, this is weird for me, too.
I've never done this before.

23:03.424 --> 23:10.341
But... I was just thinking
that if you don't come...

23:10.431 --> 23:12.262
...then I'm going to be miserable.

23:15.353 --> 23:18.390
So, there that is.

23:21.568 --> 23:23.024
What do you say?

23:40.753 --> 23:43.836
Hells yes.

23:51.097 --> 23:53.884
Whatever happens during
the trance, do not wake me.

23:53.975 --> 23:57.888
If I get to the thirty-minute
mark, pull me out.

23:57.979 --> 24:00.686
A few seconds longer
and it could be fatal.

24:00.773 --> 24:01.979
How do we wake you?

24:02.066 --> 24:04.022
You'll think of something.

24:06.904 --> 24:11.022
Okay, spark me up.

24:24.714 --> 24:26.420
[screaming]

24:46.402 --> 24:48.267
It's been a long time.

24:51.199 --> 24:54.487
I never lost hope I'd see you again.

24:54.577 --> 24:56.283
Show yourself.

25:09.592 --> 25:13.084
That's the same look you had
on your face when we got married.

25:29.070 --> 25:30.651
[MAN] Fire!

25:30.738 --> 25:35.698
[alarm]

27:26.562 --> 27:28.553
Hello, darling.

27:35.947 --> 27:37.232
This is so real.

27:37.323 --> 27:39.314
It is real, Trick.

27:39.408 --> 27:41.785
I've been watching you
since the day I died.

27:41.869 --> 27:43.985
Waiting for the right moment.

27:52.713 --> 27:57.707
I know what you seek, Trick.
I've seen what is coming for you.

27:57.802 --> 28:01.169
What? What is it?

28:01.264 --> 28:04.301
You are right to be afraid.

28:04.392 --> 28:06.053
Tell me.

28:06.143 --> 28:10.762
There was an ancient evil feeding
off the Fae during the Great War.

28:10.857 --> 28:15.100
It feasts on our aggression, our rage.

28:15.194 --> 28:17.230
When you spilt your blood and
wrote an ending to the war,

28:17.321 --> 28:19.698
you starved this evil.

28:21.075 --> 28:23.737
Now it is coming to kill you.

28:24.829 --> 28:27.491
It's going to kill you all.

28:27.582 --> 28:32.667
I ended the war because
the world depended on it.

28:32.753 --> 28:36.746
If I hadn't, no one would have survived.

28:36.841 --> 28:40.629
I only wish I had stopped it sooner.

28:40.720 --> 28:43.177
It was a mistake, Trick.

28:43.264 --> 28:45.755
You interrupted our true destiny.

28:45.850 --> 28:48.683
You created peace, but it's not real.

28:48.769 --> 28:52.307
There's still much animosity
between the clans.

28:52.398 --> 28:55.140
The war was going to right itself.

28:55.234 --> 28:57.976
A natural peace was coming.

28:59.614 --> 29:00.774
No.

29:00.865 --> 29:04.028
--There was no other choice.
--Shhh.

29:04.118 --> 29:07.406
There is still time to undo
what you have done.

29:07.496 --> 29:11.284
To unwrite the laws in your blood.

29:11.375 --> 29:18.292
Patrick, it says if you do what it asks,
it will give me back to you.

29:18.382 --> 29:20.794
We can be together again.

29:35.107 --> 29:36.563
Okay.

29:57.880 --> 30:01.873
I have to admit, I was kind of
on the fence about you.

30:01.968 --> 30:04.004
I was hoping you wouldn't be
the one to come and take my head.

30:04.095 --> 30:08.259
Well, it would just look
so super above my fireplace.

30:08.349 --> 30:09.839
What's a girl to do?

30:09.934 --> 30:13.597
The Ash's head up on your wall.

30:15.398 --> 30:18.105
It would be quite the
feather in your cap.

30:21.654 --> 30:24.566
I'm sure you'd find a way
to take credit for that, too.

30:25.950 --> 30:28.566
You and your mother,
you're like two peas in a pod.

30:28.661 --> 30:31.778
Looking to kill the Ash
like she tried to, is that it?

30:31.872 --> 30:36.707
Bo and Aife, the two Dark Fae sluts.

30:45.011 --> 30:47.627
Go on. It's okay.

30:50.057 --> 30:51.968
You should quit while you still can.

30:52.059 --> 30:54.596
You're outmatched on skill,
vagrant that you are.

30:54.687 --> 30:57.429
You're not the first
dumb-ass to underestimate me.

30:57.523 --> 30:59.479
And you won't be the last.

31:17.168 --> 31:20.456
I say, the Dark really, really suits you.

31:24.133 --> 31:25.714
I've never looked good in pastels.

31:25.801 --> 31:27.541
It's a skin tone thing.

31:31.098 --> 31:34.966
It's your rashness, your
inability to control your emotions.

31:35.061 --> 31:37.393
Hell hath no fury like
a woman totally screwed over.

31:37.480 --> 31:38.970
That kind of thing?

31:48.199 --> 31:50.440
You're dangerous.
You're danger to everyone.

31:50.534 --> 31:52.786
I don't think you realize just how
much Dark is actually inside you.

31:52.870 --> 31:54.110
It's in your soul.

31:54.205 --> 31:56.412
Everyone you know
will suffer--the doctor,

31:56.499 --> 31:59.912
the old barkeep, and the pretty,
pretty friend of yours.

32:04.965 --> 32:06.341
Are you trying to goad me, Lachlan?

32:06.425 --> 32:09.883
No, not at all. But if I were,
how am I doing so far?

32:11.138 --> 32:12.674
--Scale of one to ten?
--Yeah.

32:12.765 --> 32:14.221
Not bad.

32:17.478 --> 32:20.686
[TRICK groaning]

32:24.235 --> 32:25.395
Hale?

32:25.486 --> 32:26.942
Yeah?

32:30.074 --> 32:31.234
What the hell?

32:31.325 --> 32:33.611
[groaning]

32:41.293 --> 32:44.410
My wife would never ask me to do this.

32:44.505 --> 32:47.372
Darling, what are you
talking about? I'm right here.

32:47.466 --> 32:50.128
To unwrite the laws of the Fae.

32:50.219 --> 32:53.052
To let the war between
the Light and Dark resume.

32:53.139 --> 32:55.505
She knew how horrible it was.

32:55.599 --> 32:58.011
Trick, please, just do it for me.

32:59.311 --> 33:01.017
Who are you, really?

33:01.105 --> 33:03.972
[screaming]

33:08.154 --> 33:13.114
[screaming]

33:33.846 --> 33:36.462
That's it. Show your true face.

33:46.400 --> 33:49.767
Whoever sent you to kill me
sent the wrong little girl.

33:58.078 --> 34:01.320
I did not come here to kill you.
I came here to get the truth.

34:01.415 --> 34:03.622
Truth?

34:03.709 --> 34:05.040
The truth about your nature, perhaps.

34:05.127 --> 34:09.541
To see if those dark feelings you keep
bottled up inside are really who you are.

34:09.632 --> 34:12.749
To prove that whatever this thing is,

34:12.843 --> 34:15.880
whatever the Nain Rouge
keeps warning me about,

34:15.971 --> 34:19.680
it's already here because it's you.

34:26.273 --> 34:27.649
The Nain Rouge?

34:27.733 --> 34:29.189
Yeah.

34:29.276 --> 34:32.939
Little girl about your height.

34:33.030 --> 34:35.817
Well, if you feel so strongly about it...

34:46.210 --> 34:47.825
...take my life.

34:49.338 --> 34:52.671
Claim your vengeance.

34:52.758 --> 34:54.589
Come on, I'm right here.

34:56.679 --> 34:58.135
Do it!

35:04.561 --> 35:09.146
Like I said, I am not
in the killing business.

35:15.239 --> 35:17.946
But I don't mind a little
justice from time to time.

35:25.207 --> 35:27.664
I think you and I need
to have a little chat.

35:31.171 --> 35:32.957
Who are you?

35:33.048 --> 35:35.539
How are you able to
manipulate my vision?

35:35.634 --> 35:38.171
I am the Blood King.

35:38.262 --> 35:40.594
The Blood King?

35:40.681 --> 35:43.343
Blood King is no match for Garuda.

35:43.434 --> 35:45.140
Garuda?

35:45.227 --> 35:48.594
But they went extinct a millennium
before the Fae ever existed.

35:48.689 --> 35:51.556
Garuda extinct?

35:51.650 --> 35:53.641
No one told me.

36:03.704 --> 36:09.495
Just as Fae feed from
humans, we feed off Fae.

36:09.585 --> 36:13.043
Their rage and hatred.

36:14.131 --> 36:20.377
You ended our feasting
with your filthy blood.

36:20.471 --> 36:23.304
We will drink you dead.

36:23.390 --> 36:27.178
No! I stopped you once.

36:27.269 --> 36:32.480
I'll do it again, even if it means
spilling my own blood once more.

36:37.946 --> 36:40.198
But you already did.

36:42.451 --> 36:45.238
We smelled Blood King's blood

36:45.329 --> 36:51.746
when the Great Fae war was
ended and we starved and waited,

36:51.835 --> 36:56.750
hoping to smell it again
to exact revenge.

36:56.840 --> 37:01.129
Then there it was,

37:01.220 --> 37:08.092
like a wish blown across
a dandelion clock.

37:12.314 --> 37:16.353
Barely nothing, but just enough.

37:16.443 --> 37:19.651
Like a whisper in a storm.

37:25.702 --> 37:29.194
And now, finally...

37:37.881 --> 37:40.714
We found you.

37:40.801 --> 37:42.257
What?

37:47.599 --> 37:51.091
We have smelled where you are.

37:51.186 --> 37:52.642
No.

37:53.730 --> 37:57.018
The Dal Riata.

37:57.109 --> 38:02.729
The Dal Riata. The Dal Riata!

38:02.823 --> 38:07.783
[screaming]

38:13.917 --> 38:16.169
Contrary to what you believe...

38:17.754 --> 38:19.665
...I'm actually one of the
good guys in all of this.

38:19.756 --> 38:24.671
Oh, yeah. All good guys lie and cheat
and prey on defenceless humans

38:24.761 --> 38:26.968
and threaten to torture people.

38:27.055 --> 38:28.465
I was testing you, Bo.

38:28.557 --> 38:31.594
I had to use your doctor
friend to get under your skin.

38:31.685 --> 38:34.722
I know. It wasn't easy for me, either.

38:34.813 --> 38:36.678
What are you?

38:38.317 --> 38:42.526
What you see standing before
you is what's left of the Naga.

38:42.613 --> 38:45.446
Is that like a Fae boy
band or something?

38:45.532 --> 38:46.692
Because I don't think Justin Timberlake

38:46.783 --> 38:49.741
keeps members of his
old group in a box.

38:49.828 --> 38:53.320
Those heads you saw in the chest
were my heads, my brothers.

38:54.791 --> 38:57.658
Over the years, they were
taken away from me,

38:57.753 --> 39:01.666
cut off from my shoulders
by scared villagers,

39:01.757 --> 39:06.091
mystics and other greater evils.

39:06.178 --> 39:09.170
--Why?
--For my venom.

39:16.313 --> 39:20.181
It's the only way to kill the
most destructive presence

39:20.275 --> 39:22.231
that people have ever known.

39:22.319 --> 39:23.525
The Garuda.

39:23.612 --> 39:26.194
I don't suppose that's
a smoked cheese, is it?

39:26.281 --> 39:29.193
It's the thing that's headed this way.

39:29.284 --> 39:30.820
The evil the Nain Rouge spoke about.

39:30.911 --> 39:32.196
The evil that I have been tracking down

39:32.287 --> 39:36.280
and been fighting for
centuries upon centuries.

39:36.375 --> 39:38.912
Well, why didn't you just tell me?

39:41.588 --> 39:44.580
I needed to be sure.

39:44.675 --> 39:46.165
I had to be sure this time.

39:46.260 --> 39:47.124
Sure of what?

39:47.219 --> 39:49.961
The Garuda feeds off
our anger and our violence.

39:50.055 --> 39:51.716
I needed to be sure that you,
unlike your mother,

39:51.807 --> 39:53.718
could control that anger.

39:53.809 --> 39:58.974
Not to be led by your emotions,
making you vengeful, intent on blood.

39:59.064 --> 40:05.310
Why me? Why do all of this to me?

40:05.404 --> 40:08.066
Because of your abilities.

40:08.156 --> 40:11.148
They come from lust, passion,
not aggression, not hatred.

40:11.243 --> 40:14.406
In order to defeat the Garuda, you must
be able to attack without attacking.

40:14.496 --> 40:19.581
And like it or not,
succubus, you're perfect.

40:19.668 --> 40:22.125
The time has come, Bo.

40:22.212 --> 40:24.373
This is our last chance.

40:24.464 --> 40:26.546
Last chance for what?

40:31.805 --> 40:36.174
I need you to lead the Fae into
battle against its greatest enemy

40:36.268 --> 40:39.431
and take this bastard
down once and for all.

40:39.521 --> 40:41.603
What do you say?

40:41.690 --> 40:44.648
Are you up for the challenge?

40:44.735 --> 40:47.397
Will you be my champion?

40:47.487 --> 40:52.447
[groaning]

40:54.411 --> 40:55.867
It's time.

40:58.790 --> 41:00.906
--Come on!
--I don't understand. It won't come off.

41:01.001 --> 41:02.616
Well, what do we do?

42:07.693 --> 42:14.110
[whispers] Trick.

42:16.076 --> 42:17.862
Hey, Bo-Bo, where you been all day?

42:17.953 --> 42:20.569
I've been calling you
and texting you and,

42:20.664 --> 42:23.371
I mean, I've been doing
other stuff besides texting.

42:23.458 --> 42:26.871
Might be referred to as sexting.

42:26.962 --> 42:28.293
Bo, you okay?

42:28.380 --> 42:32.840
Oh, yeah. Sorry, Kenz. I just...

42:32.926 --> 42:35.008
I don't know what I...

42:35.095 --> 42:37.461
"Today"
--Has been the best day ever?

42:37.556 --> 42:39.717
Was one strange, messed up day.

42:39.808 --> 42:43.926
Dude, let me tell you, it has been
so wickedly, wickedly messed up.

42:44.020 --> 42:46.807
What did you do today? Do you
want to know what I did? Hmm?

42:46.898 --> 42:48.434
I can't really get into
it right now, Kenz.

42:48.525 --> 42:50.061
I think I just have to go to bed.

42:50.152 --> 42:52.689
Bo, I said do you want
to know what I did?

42:52.779 --> 42:53.894
--Kenzi--
--Long fly ball.

42:53.989 --> 42:59.200
Oh, baby, it looks like it's going to
be going. And yes! It is out of here!

42:59.286 --> 43:00.867
Home run!

43:00.954 --> 43:04.242
And, if I don't mind my saying,
it was one for the Hall of Fame.

43:04.332 --> 43:06.823
I mean, that is not the first time
Nate has swung a bat, let me tell you.

43:06.918 --> 43:11.287
Oh. That's great, Kenzi.
I'm happy for you, really.

43:11.381 --> 43:13.758
He even asked me to
go away with him on tour.

43:13.842 --> 43:16.254
Do you think I should go?

43:16.344 --> 43:18.676
Yeah. Yeah, go.

43:18.764 --> 43:20.971
Really? Okay. I'm going to go pack.

43:21.057 --> 43:22.513
Ahh!

43:25.979 --> 43:29.312
And I'm going to get up
early tomorrow and...

43:31.359 --> 43:33.566
...save the world.
