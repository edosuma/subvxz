02:23.293 --> 02:24.726
- It's back.
- Not now, Gary.

02:24.761 --> 02:27.695
The humming from the microwave
tower across the street.

02:27.730 --> 02:29.230
I can't do my work.

02:29.265 --> 02:31.166
Gary, I called
the cellular company

02:31.200 --> 02:32.868
and told them to shut it down,
okay?

02:32.902 --> 02:35.737
Yeah, they did shut it down,
but then they turned it back on.

02:35.771 --> 02:37.839
Bill.

02:37.873 --> 02:39.407
You need to shoot it.

02:39.441 --> 02:40.775
I'm not shooting anything,
okay?

02:40.810 --> 02:42.376
- Look, I'll call them again.
- No, Bill.

02:42.411 --> 02:44.245
No more talking.
It's time for action.

02:44.280 --> 02:45.747
Give me the gun.
I'll shoot it.

02:45.781 --> 02:47.348
Gary, I'm not giving you
my gun.

02:47.382 --> 02:49.116
Yeah, give me--
no, you're right.

02:49.151 --> 02:51.285
- Give me a grenade.
- Gary, out.

02:51.319 --> 02:54.154
Bill, give me a grenade.

02:54.188 --> 02:57.690
Gary, good-bye.

02:58.860 --> 03:02.596
You don't even have
a grenade.

03:02.630 --> 03:04.097
Bye, Bill.

03:05.633 --> 03:09.770
Nina, I need you
to help me push someone.

03:09.804 --> 03:12.539
Sorry, Gary.
I can't do that.

03:12.574 --> 03:14.908
No, but Dr. Rosen says
that we're a team,

03:14.943 --> 03:16.410
and we have to help each other.

03:16.444 --> 03:17.678
I am helping you, Gary.

03:17.713 --> 03:19.246
I'm keeping you
out of trouble.

03:21.116 --> 03:24.284
Look, I just want to spend
more time with him.

03:24.318 --> 03:25.352
Well, maybe I can pick him up

03:25.386 --> 03:28.755
from school
a few days a week, huh?

03:28.789 --> 03:30.990
Well, then drop him off.

03:34.928 --> 03:37.395
Oh, let me guess.

03:37.430 --> 03:39.097
Chamomile, right,

03:39.132 --> 03:40.866
and lavender.
What else?

03:40.901 --> 03:43.235
A touch of angelica oil,
some Jasmine,

03:43.270 --> 03:44.804
and a little bit
of sandalwood.

03:44.838 --> 03:46.806
Oh.

03:46.840 --> 03:48.341
Didn't go so well?

03:48.375 --> 03:50.776
I don't know
what you're talking about.

03:50.811 --> 03:54.414
Well, these are all aromas
that help relieve stress,

03:54.449 --> 03:56.616
so I'm guessing your meeting
with the young man

03:56.651 --> 03:58.819
that your parents chose
didn't go all that swimmingly.

03:58.853 --> 04:00.654
And I'm guessing
that Nina told you.

04:00.688 --> 04:02.923
Yes, Nina told me.

04:02.957 --> 04:05.858
But I want to remind you,
Rachel, of all the good work

04:05.893 --> 04:08.561
we've been doing, you know,
towards your assertiveness

04:08.595 --> 04:11.497
and confidence, so, if you ever
need to tell your parents no...

04:11.531 --> 04:13.532
And I'd like to remind you,
Dr. Rosen,

04:13.566 --> 04:15.600
that we've been working
on my assertiveness,

04:15.635 --> 04:18.403
but I still have
a long way to go, Dr. Rosen.

04:18.437 --> 04:20.904
Mm.
You just interrupted me.

04:20.940 --> 04:23.709
I'm so sorry.

04:23.743 --> 04:25.744
- I didn't mean to be rude.
- Rachel, don't be.

04:25.778 --> 04:27.012
It's exactly
what I'm talking about.

04:27.046 --> 04:28.813
Progress.

04:35.555 --> 04:37.823
Hmm.

04:37.857 --> 04:39.858
Busy morning.

04:41.828 --> 04:44.096
No, look, we don't have
to go through the courts

04:44.130 --> 04:47.532
if you would just agree...

04:47.566 --> 04:49.200
Yeah, fine,
stick to the schedule.

04:51.436 --> 04:54.138
Divorce is a tricky thing,
isn't it?

04:54.172 --> 04:56.474
Especially when there's
a child involved.

04:56.508 --> 04:58.875
My therapy session
isn't till tomorrow, Doc.

05:00.311 --> 05:02.512
As someone who's been
through it,

05:02.546 --> 05:05.349
understand that it's never
a simple equation.

05:05.383 --> 05:07.117
But no matter what happens,

05:07.152 --> 05:08.952
Tyler will always be your son.

05:12.123 --> 05:13.724
You should write that up.

05:13.758 --> 05:16.327
Publish a self-help book.

05:18.531 --> 05:21.399
Hicks broke another one.
That's three.

05:21.434 --> 05:25.003
It's fascinating what happens
when you let stress get to you.

05:25.037 --> 05:26.438
Yeah, my abilities
don't work so well.

05:26.473 --> 05:29.241
But you have made
significant strides, Mr. Hicks,

05:29.276 --> 05:30.710
whether you realize it
or not.

05:30.744 --> 05:32.445
And that's something
that you should--

05:32.480 --> 05:36.050
Excuse me.

05:36.084 --> 05:37.051
Sorry.

05:37.085 --> 05:38.719
Rosen.

05:38.754 --> 05:40.455
Doc, we have a situation.

05:40.489 --> 05:42.157
Hope you got
your Metro card.

06:01.338 --> 06:03.773
Some of the witnesses,
they say Officer Laurinzano

06:03.807 --> 06:06.809
started this mess,
but I don't see it.

06:06.844 --> 06:09.512
Bobby was on the job 15 years,

06:09.547 --> 06:11.313
just marking time
till his pension.

06:11.348 --> 06:14.517
The last thing he wanted
was trouble.

06:16.286 --> 06:18.053
Wait a minute.

06:18.088 --> 06:19.822
Exactly who are you people?

06:21.324 --> 06:22.991
Thanks for your help,
officer.

06:24.727 --> 06:26.294
You can go now.

06:29.664 --> 06:32.199
You didn't push him
too severely, did you?

06:32.233 --> 06:34.100
I don't like when they
start asking questions back.

06:34.135 --> 06:35.969
You know you could have waited
on me, right?

06:36.443 --> 06:37.711
- My badge still works.
- Where's Gary?

06:37.745 --> 06:39.012
Pending
your disciplinary review.

06:39.047 --> 06:40.948
He's over there.
There's no way in hell

06:40.982 --> 06:42.416
they're gonna let me go

06:42.450 --> 06:45.052
because of one bad day
on the job, okay?

06:45.087 --> 06:47.622
Besides, my badge
still has its own magic.

06:47.656 --> 06:49.056
Anyway, Doc,

06:49.091 --> 06:51.125
I talked
to the transit cops.

06:51.160 --> 06:53.962
They say all the riders
are completely confused.

06:53.996 --> 06:55.330
Everyone
apparently just lost it.

06:55.364 --> 06:57.498
One minute,
everything's copacetic.

06:57.532 --> 06:58.999
The next thing they know,

06:59.034 --> 07:00.734
kicking, biting, screaming.

07:00.768 --> 07:03.069
Well, Wilson was right.
This is right up our alley.

07:03.104 --> 07:05.371
Gary, Gary,
do you have anything?

07:05.406 --> 07:06.939
No, it's chatter.

07:06.973 --> 07:08.874
Chatter, chatter.

07:08.909 --> 07:12.310
Lieutenant Bixby wants his wife
to pick up $50

07:12.345 --> 07:13.912
of lottery tickets.

07:13.946 --> 07:15.447
My mom won't let me ride
the subway, though.

07:15.481 --> 07:17.149
She says it's too stressful.

07:17.183 --> 07:18.784
There's too much stimulation.

07:18.818 --> 07:20.286
I don't believe this.

07:20.320 --> 07:22.088
Yeah, no,
she says it's crowded

07:22.122 --> 07:23.523
and it's smelly,
and she's right.

07:23.557 --> 07:24.791
Nobody's talking
about your mama, Gary.

07:24.825 --> 07:27.027
Hey, excuse me.
He's with me.

07:27.061 --> 07:29.696
Let him through, please.
FBI. Let him through.

07:29.730 --> 07:32.666
Thank you.

07:32.700 --> 07:34.067
Hicks, you have got
to be kidding me.

07:34.101 --> 07:35.402
- What?
- You leave a crime scene

07:35.436 --> 07:36.903
to go get a cup of coffee?

07:36.937 --> 07:38.771
You know, I'd have brought you
a doughnut, but they ran out.

07:38.805 --> 07:40.773
You think that's funny?
This ain't the damn movies.

07:40.807 --> 07:41.774
Let me tell you something,
Hicks.

07:41.808 --> 07:42.875
Learn to follow instructions.

07:42.909 --> 07:44.343
- You were a Marine, weren't you?
- Yeah.

07:44.378 --> 07:45.811
And now you know why
I'm a civilian.

07:47.548 --> 07:50.016
Well, Agent Wilson
decides to show up.

07:50.050 --> 07:53.052
That's your department
of defense for you.

07:53.086 --> 07:54.954
Four unexplained riots
in the past two months.

07:54.988 --> 07:56.722
1 dead,
13 injured in Cleveland,

07:56.756 --> 07:58.323
15 hurt in Pittsburgh,

07:58.358 --> 08:00.459
3 fatalities in Philadelphia,
and now this.

08:00.493 --> 08:02.694
That's 29 people
in the hospital

08:02.729 --> 08:04.229
and 5 in the morgue.

08:04.263 --> 08:06.898
NSA says this isn't one
of their usual suspects.

08:06.932 --> 08:08.066
Doesn't look natural.

08:08.100 --> 08:09.535
So does this look
like an Alpha or not?

08:09.569 --> 08:11.469
Don, I only just got here
myself.

08:11.504 --> 08:13.171
All I can tell you so far

08:13.205 --> 08:15.606
is that Alpha involvement
is a possibility.

08:15.641 --> 08:16.941
Lee, you sold us on your group

08:16.975 --> 08:18.376
for exactly
this sort of situation.

08:18.410 --> 08:20.411
If it is an Alpha
causing these riots,

08:20.445 --> 08:21.512
you need to find him for us,

08:21.546 --> 08:23.748
preferably
before the local cops,

08:23.782 --> 08:26.417
CNN, or some damn blogger
opens up a can of worms.

08:26.451 --> 08:28.986
Well, exposure is
the last thing any of us want.

08:29.021 --> 08:31.088
Then deliver.

08:31.123 --> 08:33.557
Wilson, always a pleasure.

08:33.592 --> 08:35.426
You need anything?

08:35.460 --> 08:36.994
We're fine, Nina.
Thank you.

08:37.029 --> 08:40.264
Don, one more thing.

08:40.298 --> 08:42.700
While you're here, could you
flash your credentials?

08:42.734 --> 08:44.768
I'd like to get a hold of
the train surveillance footage.

08:44.803 --> 08:47.371
Harken's FBI badge
only goes so far,

08:47.405 --> 08:49.039
but the words
"Homeland Security,"

08:49.074 --> 08:50.441
they work wonders these days.

08:50.475 --> 08:51.609
I'll see what I can do.

08:54.813 --> 08:58.549
I forgot how much the subway
smelled like human waste.

08:58.583 --> 09:00.417
Thank God for government limos.

09:00.452 --> 09:03.086
Thank you, Don.

10:05.086 --> 10:06.587
So I was able
to get witness statements

10:06.621 --> 10:08.555
from the previous incidents.

10:08.589 --> 10:10.023
Same exact pattern.

10:10.057 --> 10:12.792
Anger, violence,
for no good reason.

10:12.826 --> 10:15.962
Followed by sadness
and confusion.

10:15.997 --> 10:16.964
When I push people,

10:16.998 --> 10:18.198
they come out of it
pretty confused.

10:18.233 --> 10:19.366
That's because
they're not in control

10:19.401 --> 10:20.735
of their actions.

10:20.769 --> 10:22.670
And I don't think that crowd
was in control either.

10:22.705 --> 10:23.939
So what you're saying is that
it was an Alpha like Nina

10:23.973 --> 10:25.474
that pushed the crowd.

10:25.508 --> 10:26.542
Not exactly.

10:26.576 --> 10:27.877
Nina can't
push a whole crowd.

10:27.911 --> 10:29.512
Someone else is at play.

10:29.547 --> 10:31.448
It's ready.

10:34.719 --> 10:36.120
Pheromones.

10:36.154 --> 10:39.056
That's what's causing these ants
to be so aggressive.

10:39.090 --> 10:41.358
Normally, the brain controls
the release of pheromones,

10:41.393 --> 10:43.193
but our Alpha
can supercede brain function

10:43.228 --> 10:45.296
and fire them off
at will.

10:45.330 --> 10:47.299
And I think that's exactly
what Rachel detected

10:47.333 --> 10:48.467
in the subway.

10:48.501 --> 10:49.701
Yeah, and especially
on the monkey.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.203
That's where the scent
was the strongest.

10:51.237 --> 10:53.339
It's all about the monkey.
The monkey was ground zero.

10:53.373 --> 10:56.042
Do not open this bag, Gary.
That's evidence.

10:56.076 --> 10:57.577
In the case
of these ants,

10:57.611 --> 10:59.679
the scent triggered
a defense mechanism

10:59.714 --> 11:01.815
when the hive was threatened
by the scorpion.

11:01.849 --> 11:03.183
Well, whoever did this
must feel threatened a lot.

11:03.218 --> 11:05.653
Four times
in the past few months.

11:05.687 --> 11:07.555
We've got to stop this.
Why us?

11:07.589 --> 11:09.791
Besides Harken here, none of us
has any real training

11:09.825 --> 11:11.126
for this type of thing.

11:11.160 --> 11:13.328
I spent four years
at Langley.

11:13.362 --> 11:16.230
Well, translating Farsi.

11:16.265 --> 11:17.632
But still, it's--

11:17.666 --> 11:19.233
You know, I understand
what you're saying, Mr. Hicks.

11:19.267 --> 11:20.601
It would be a lot easier

11:20.635 --> 11:23.036
to leave this in the hands
of traditional law enforcement.

11:23.070 --> 11:25.138
Only New York's finest
aren't exactly trained

11:25.172 --> 11:26.406
to handle Alphas.

11:26.440 --> 11:29.342
Whereas the five of you
have some very special gifts

11:29.377 --> 11:32.145
which make you
as surprising and as unexpected

11:32.179 --> 11:33.579
as the person
we're looking for.

11:33.614 --> 11:36.716
If we can't solve this,
who can?

11:36.750 --> 11:37.751
Hurrah.

11:40.388 --> 11:42.690
It's--it's streaming.

11:42.724 --> 11:43.858
Wilson got
the surveillance footage,

11:43.892 --> 11:45.427
and it's streaming.

11:45.461 --> 11:48.130
- It's humming again.
- What hum, Gary?

11:48.164 --> 11:50.766
- It's a Gary thing.
- It's not a Gary thing!

11:50.800 --> 11:53.536
There's a hum
across the street.

11:53.570 --> 11:55.004
It's unbearable.

11:55.038 --> 11:56.973
- There's no hum--
- There's a hum. Fix it.

11:57.007 --> 11:58.374
We'll look into it, Gary.

11:58.409 --> 12:01.244
I've expressed myself.

12:01.278 --> 12:03.279
There--
there wasn't a hum.

12:03.314 --> 12:05.548
♪ Hmmmmm-mmmm ♪

12:05.583 --> 12:06.849
That's not funny.

12:20.432 --> 12:23.467
All right, so Rosen
likes to make speeches.

12:23.501 --> 12:24.868
But it doesn't mean
what he has to say

12:24.903 --> 12:27.604
isn't important.

12:29.974 --> 12:31.942
Listen, Rosen wants you
on his team

12:31.976 --> 12:33.777
because he thinks
he can help you.

12:33.811 --> 12:35.178
And he probably can.

12:35.213 --> 12:37.447
He helped me.

12:37.481 --> 12:39.216
I know it's
hard to believe.

12:39.250 --> 12:41.552
But when I met Rosen...

12:41.586 --> 12:44.054
I was a mess.

12:44.089 --> 12:47.192
Plus, your hyperkinesis,

12:47.226 --> 12:49.027
it comes in handy.

12:49.061 --> 12:52.330
So me being on the team,
it's, uh, win-win, huh?

12:52.364 --> 12:54.532
Doesn't matter
what I think.

12:54.566 --> 12:56.801
It matters
what you think.

13:06.646 --> 13:08.513
Come on, Tony,
you promised me seats

13:08.548 --> 13:09.681
right behind the dugout.

13:09.716 --> 13:10.817
Don't go changing
your mind on me now.

13:10.851 --> 13:13.719
Bill--Bill, please.

13:13.754 --> 13:16.589
The surveillance footage,
I think I found something.

13:16.624 --> 13:18.525
Okay,
I'll call you right back.

13:18.559 --> 13:21.295
All right,
it is right about...

13:21.329 --> 13:22.329
Here.

13:22.364 --> 13:23.731
What exactly
am I looking at?

13:23.766 --> 13:25.700
Right here, look.

13:25.734 --> 13:27.803
- The monkey.
- That's our ground zero.

13:27.837 --> 13:29.805
The monkey had
the strongest pheromone scent

13:29.839 --> 13:31.173
of anything
in the subway car,

13:31.207 --> 13:32.841
so it had to have been
right next to the Alpha

13:32.876 --> 13:34.310
when the riot started.

13:34.344 --> 13:35.844
While hanging off
the girl's backpack?

13:35.879 --> 13:37.546
Best guess,
she's our Alpha.

13:37.580 --> 13:41.784
We need to find that girl
before she kills anybody else.

13:49.199 --> 13:51.066
So yeah, her name
is Tracy Beaumont.

13:51.101 --> 13:52.301
She's 17 years old.

13:52.335 --> 13:53.569
Rachel found
surveillance footage

13:53.603 --> 13:56.005
of her entering the train
on 47th Street.

13:56.039 --> 13:57.673
She was taken
to Saint Boniface Hospital.

13:57.707 --> 14:00.175
She was treated
for cuts and bruises.

14:00.210 --> 14:01.676
Released,
but then she skipped out

14:01.711 --> 14:02.844
before the cops
could interview her.

14:02.878 --> 14:04.712
Well, we now have
a name and a face.

14:04.746 --> 14:05.813
It's a start, right?

14:05.847 --> 14:08.115
That is assuming
she gave her real name.

14:08.149 --> 14:11.184
Well, that's an astute
observation, Mr. Hicks.

14:11.219 --> 14:14.355
Well, apparently
I'm an investigator now.

14:14.389 --> 14:16.423
- Well, I'll start here.
- Mm-hmm.

14:16.457 --> 14:17.924
If Tracy
is her real name,

14:17.959 --> 14:19.360
I should be able
to dig something up.

14:19.394 --> 14:22.062
Gary, you gonna monitor the ATM
and street cameras from here?

14:22.096 --> 14:24.297
- No, I can't--no.
- Yeah, Gary, that's what--

14:24.331 --> 14:26.299
I can't do that from here,
Bill, it's too much humming.

14:26.334 --> 14:27.701
Gary, that's part
of the job.

14:27.735 --> 14:29.702
- You have to use your gun.
- No, there will be no guns

14:29.737 --> 14:30.803
being used on anything, Gary.
Yeah.

14:30.838 --> 14:33.339
Gary, have you seen
what time it is?

14:33.373 --> 14:35.374
Yes, I have to
be in bed at 9:30.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.209
You're killing me.
Y-yes, I'm sorry.

14:37.243 --> 14:39.778
He can look for Tracy at home
just as well.

14:39.812 --> 14:42.113
Mr. Hicks, Nina,
Rachel and I will--

14:42.148 --> 14:44.182
- You're on stand-by.
- On stand-by, fine.

14:44.216 --> 14:47.251
So this is, like, a real job,
I mean...I'm on call?

14:47.286 --> 14:48.887
People are being killed,
Mr. Hicks,

14:48.921 --> 14:50.222
and we have to find out how.

14:50.256 --> 14:52.224
If it's any consolation,
you now have

14:52.258 --> 14:54.359
an excellent health plan.

15:04.238 --> 15:06.206
His family
is very well established.

15:06.240 --> 15:07.874
But you can't
appear desperate,

15:07.909 --> 15:09.242
despite your condition.

15:09.277 --> 15:10.577
Mom, I'm better now.

15:10.611 --> 15:12.478
Dr. Rosen's really helped.

15:12.513 --> 15:15.047
A lot more reason to
meet a man while you're healthy.

15:15.082 --> 15:17.616
You make it sound like
I have some sort of a disease.

15:17.650 --> 15:18.850
Like I'm gonna
get sick again.

15:18.885 --> 15:20.519
I'm fine, mom.

15:20.553 --> 15:22.887
We worry.
That's what parents do.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.122
But I'm fine, mom.

15:24.156 --> 15:25.890
Besides, you don't
want to stay single

15:25.924 --> 15:28.926
your whole life.

15:41.673 --> 15:43.007
Yes, Gary.

15:43.041 --> 15:44.541
I've found her.

15:44.576 --> 15:46.209
Tracy Beaumont,
the girl with the monkey.

15:46.244 --> 15:48.912
She's at 34th,
walking north on Sixth.

15:48.946 --> 15:53.482
That's a very good street
to walk on--it's very well lit.

15:53.517 --> 15:54.483
Excellent work.

15:54.518 --> 15:56.319
Just keep an eye
on her, please.

15:56.353 --> 15:58.187
She's turning onto
Broadway, northwest.

15:58.222 --> 15:59.522
Broadway goes northwest.

15:59.556 --> 16:01.356
Yes, I know.
Keep your phone on.

16:03.960 --> 16:06.828
Now, listen,
we've identified a suspect.

16:06.863 --> 16:09.598
Yes, I'll let you know
as soon as we have her.

16:09.632 --> 16:11.132
Don, yeah--yes, it's a her.

16:11.167 --> 16:12.634
Don, we're on location now.

16:12.668 --> 16:14.637
I'm gonna have to
get back to you...

16:14.671 --> 16:16.806
Gary said she should be
around here somewhere.

16:16.840 --> 16:18.975
I can smell traces
of the pheromone in the air.

16:19.009 --> 16:21.712
Can you
track the source?

16:24.516 --> 16:26.484
It's the alley.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.243
What is it, Rachel?

16:55.116 --> 16:56.751
- What is it?
- I lost it.

16:56.785 --> 16:58.386
- What?
- I lost it--I can't.

16:58.420 --> 17:00.188
Focus.

17:00.222 --> 17:02.157
All right, listen, listen.

17:02.191 --> 17:03.726
You guys fan out, okay?

17:03.760 --> 17:05.027
Up this way--
if you see anything,

17:05.060 --> 17:06.362
you know what to do, right?

17:06.396 --> 17:07.896
Give me a call.
We only want the--

17:07.931 --> 17:08.897
- eyes only.
- Eyes only.

17:08.932 --> 17:10.633
Hicks, with me, come on.

17:10.667 --> 17:12.335
Nina.

17:16.638 --> 17:18.807
Dr. Rosen, I am asleep.

17:18.840 --> 17:21.276
Uh, I know it's way
past your bedtime, I'm sorry.

17:21.310 --> 17:22.910
But Gary, I need you
to ping our location

17:22.944 --> 17:24.111
and then check the area.

17:24.146 --> 17:26.079
She's somewhere near us.

17:27.515 --> 17:31.518
Uh, okay--okay, you have to
go through the parking lot.

17:31.553 --> 17:34.021
Yeah.

17:34.056 --> 17:36.424
And now turn right.

17:36.459 --> 17:39.027
Heart right?

17:39.061 --> 17:40.829
I mean left, left.

17:40.864 --> 17:42.631
That's right, Gary,
left, thank you.

17:42.666 --> 17:45.401
Okay, which way now, Gary?

17:46.770 --> 17:51.174
Uh, well, we're at the corner
of 52nd and Eighth.

17:55.046 --> 17:56.112
Dr. Rosen...

17:56.147 --> 17:58.614
She's there.

17:58.649 --> 18:00.416
She's this way.

18:02.686 --> 18:04.954
She's going
into that youth hostel.

18:04.988 --> 18:06.823
Bill, four blocks
north of the van.

18:06.857 --> 18:08.357
Okay, right there.
Come on, let's go!

18:08.391 --> 18:11.060
Come on!

18:20.269 --> 18:21.703
She went in there?

18:21.738 --> 18:24.673
That's not good.
We have to get her out.

18:24.708 --> 18:26.608
I'm not sure
I can push them all.

18:26.643 --> 18:30.412
Don't go anywhere near them.
They're covered in pheromones.

18:36.687 --> 18:38.989
That's her.
That's the girl--Tracy!

18:39.023 --> 18:41.091
Tracy Beaumont!

18:41.126 --> 18:43.227
I got her! I got her!

18:46.265 --> 18:47.698
Hey!

18:47.733 --> 18:51.034
Hey, don't run from me!
What are you doing?

18:52.170 --> 18:54.371
Get back here!

18:54.406 --> 18:56.473
I only want to talk!

18:57.609 --> 19:01.044
Young man,
do you know that girl?

19:01.078 --> 19:02.278
He was in the subway,
Dr. Rosen.

19:02.313 --> 19:04.247
You were in the subway.
No, no, no, no.

19:04.281 --> 19:05.348
No! No!

19:05.382 --> 19:08.217
Hicks! Hicks! Stop him!

19:18.196 --> 19:20.498
What did I do?
I didn't do anything wrong!

19:27.908 --> 19:29.508
Why are you running, huh?
Why are you running?

19:29.543 --> 19:31.343
- Get off of me!
- Relax!

19:34.548 --> 19:36.715
You were there
in the subway.

19:36.749 --> 19:38.683
I don't know
what you're talking about.

19:38.718 --> 19:40.552
I don't know anything.

19:44.289 --> 19:45.256
Young man...

19:45.290 --> 19:48.726
Your friend back there,
Tracy Beaumont,

19:48.760 --> 19:50.661
she's in
a lot of trouble.

19:50.696 --> 19:52.397
We're trying to find her
to help her

19:52.431 --> 19:54.198
before anyone else
gets hurt.

19:58.738 --> 20:00.172
Dr. Rosen, he has the scent
all over him.

20:00.206 --> 20:04.143
He must have been right
next to her when it went off.

20:04.178 --> 20:05.678
You know about that?

20:05.713 --> 20:08.148
The thing that my sister does
that makes everyone angry?

20:08.182 --> 20:09.716
Yes, yes, we do.

20:09.751 --> 20:12.819
It doesn't work on me.

20:12.853 --> 20:15.121
I'm immune.

20:15.156 --> 20:18.525
Gary, tell me
you know where she is.

20:18.560 --> 20:20.727
- She got into a cab.
- Which one?

20:20.761 --> 20:23.029
Bill, it was yellow.

20:28.169 --> 20:29.870
- She's--she's your sister.
- Yes.

20:29.904 --> 20:32.672
I've been looking for her
for months.

20:32.707 --> 20:35.909
I'm the only one
that can stop her.

20:51.542 --> 20:53.476
'Cause Dr. Rosen
wanted me to come in--

20:53.511 --> 20:55.478
Yeah, well, we're on call.
That's part of the job.

20:55.513 --> 20:57.247
No, that's not
what my mom said.

20:57.281 --> 21:00.684
She said we--she used words
that I can't use, but--

21:00.718 --> 21:02.552
and then
she drove me here.

21:02.587 --> 21:03.887
The thing is Gary,

21:03.921 --> 21:05.288
there's a dangerous Alpha
out there and--

21:05.322 --> 21:06.456
- Yeah.
- We have to deal with it.

21:06.490 --> 21:07.891
Yeah, I know,
'cause we're important.

21:07.925 --> 21:10.894
But I should be sleeping now,
and there's still a hum.

21:10.928 --> 21:12.629
So I'm upset,
and I'm complaining.

21:12.663 --> 21:14.197
I just complained.
You sure did.

21:14.231 --> 21:17.801
Well, he says
she's his sister--yes, Don.

21:17.835 --> 21:21.171
Don, of course
we're checking.

21:21.205 --> 21:23.240
No, if you people
come stomping in here,

21:23.274 --> 21:25.643
we might lose any chance
of him cooperating.

21:25.677 --> 21:28.413
Just let me speak with him.
I'm sure I can convince him

21:28.447 --> 21:29.447
to lead us to her.

21:29.481 --> 21:32.083
Don--unh.

21:32.118 --> 21:33.885
He hung up.

21:33.920 --> 21:36.255
I'll take that as consent.

21:36.289 --> 21:38.591
Do you want me
to go in there with you?

21:38.625 --> 21:39.925
I hope that
won't be necessary.

21:46.132 --> 21:47.765
You can take a seat
if you like.

21:47.800 --> 21:49.567
No, I don't wanna
sit on my ass.

21:49.601 --> 21:51.034
When can I
get outta here?

21:51.069 --> 21:52.603
Believe me, we don't
want to keep you any longer

21:52.637 --> 21:54.171
than we have to.

21:54.205 --> 21:56.039
But people are dying, son,
and it's essential

21:56.074 --> 21:57.674
that you help us
find your sister.

21:57.709 --> 21:59.176
I don't even know
who you guys are!

21:59.210 --> 22:01.011
I haven't seen
a badge or anything.

22:01.046 --> 22:02.413
How do I even
know you're cops?

22:02.447 --> 22:04.015
Well, we're not cops.

22:04.049 --> 22:07.719
We're trained specialists
in cases like your sister's.

22:07.753 --> 22:10.455
And I don't think you want
the cops to find her

22:10.490 --> 22:13.693
before we do.

22:15.429 --> 22:18.198
Okay, so, um,
what are you--

22:18.232 --> 22:20.400
what are you guys
gonna do to her?

22:20.435 --> 22:21.702
Please, sit down.

22:21.736 --> 22:23.703
We're going to do
everything we can

22:23.737 --> 22:26.906
to keep your sister
from hurting herself

22:26.941 --> 22:28.641
or anyone else
for that matter.

22:28.676 --> 22:32.012
Now, I'm going to record
our conversation.

22:32.046 --> 22:35.348
It's only for the purposes
of myself and my team.

22:35.383 --> 22:36.549
Okay, what do
you wanna know

22:36.584 --> 22:38.318
so that I can
get out of here and find her?

22:38.352 --> 22:41.788
We can start
with your name.

22:41.822 --> 22:43.923
Uh, Matthew.

22:43.957 --> 22:45.625
Matthew Hurley.

22:45.659 --> 22:47.627
Yeah, this is
Special Agent Bill Harken.

22:47.662 --> 22:48.996
I need a background check.

22:49.030 --> 22:53.500
Hurley--but your sister's
last name is Beaumont.

22:53.535 --> 22:57.638
Beaumont is
our mother's maiden name.

22:57.673 --> 23:00.975
Or at least it, um...
It was.

23:01.009 --> 23:03.777
Uh, she's--she's dead now.

23:05.046 --> 23:07.381
Our father...

23:07.415 --> 23:10.750
beat her to death
three years ago.

23:10.785 --> 23:16.288
And you are concerned
that Tracy caused that?

23:16.323 --> 23:19.224
Alice.
It's Alice.

23:20.794 --> 23:23.629
She must have changed her name
to hide from everything

23:23.663 --> 23:25.397
that happened back home.

23:25.432 --> 23:27.967
And where is home?

23:28.001 --> 23:29.535
Arden, Ohio.

23:29.569 --> 23:30.869
Harken, you hearing this?

23:30.904 --> 23:33.206
Hey, Hicks, this is
what I do for a living, okay?

23:33.240 --> 23:35.375
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

23:35.409 --> 23:37.010
Yes, I will hold.

23:37.044 --> 23:39.112
It's only
a multiple murder case.

23:39.147 --> 23:41.147
Matthew,
you said your father

23:41.182 --> 23:42.749
caused your mother's death.

23:42.784 --> 23:46.419
But when I asked you
if you thought that Tracy had--

23:46.454 --> 23:48.288
uh, Alice, had anything
to do with it,

23:48.323 --> 23:49.923
you avoided the question.

23:49.957 --> 23:52.159
Do you think she had
anything to do with it?

23:52.193 --> 23:55.929
Look,
Alice is a good person.

23:55.964 --> 24:01.034
My sister--sometimes
it all gets away from her.

24:01.068 --> 24:02.903
So it all got away from her
on the subway?

24:02.937 --> 24:04.271
It was that stupid cop.

24:04.305 --> 24:05.505
He shows up,
and then she panicked.

24:05.540 --> 24:07.674
You know, I just--
I don't know,

24:07.709 --> 24:10.577
sometimes she just
gets really scared.

24:10.611 --> 24:15.315
And I am the only one
that can keep her under control.

24:15.349 --> 24:17.951
Arden, Ohio.
The town website is down.

24:17.985 --> 24:19.051
Okay, thanks Gary.

24:19.086 --> 24:20.853
But just
keep looking, okay?

24:20.888 --> 24:22.455
Yeah, Rachel,
this is what I do for a living.

24:22.489 --> 24:24.024
It's what I do
for a living.

24:24.058 --> 24:26.126
Okay--okay, Gary.

24:26.160 --> 24:27.561
No.

24:27.595 --> 24:29.396
This stupid humming.

24:29.430 --> 24:32.532
Please, it's the microwave
tower across the street.

24:32.567 --> 24:35.302
Fix it, please.

24:36.771 --> 24:39.606
So you're saying that
she's some kind of a freak?

24:39.641 --> 24:41.141
No.

24:41.176 --> 24:43.410
Absolutely not.

24:43.444 --> 24:45.379
I am not saying that.

24:45.413 --> 24:48.682
I'm saying that she has
a medical condition...

24:48.716 --> 24:50.083
Which I can
help her with.

24:50.117 --> 24:51.952
And you may be the key.

24:51.986 --> 24:53.954
Because, as you said,

24:53.988 --> 24:56.790
her ability--
it does not affect you.

24:56.824 --> 24:59.458
Why--
why doesn't it affect me?

24:59.493 --> 25:01.727
Because I believe your brain
produces enough serotonin

25:01.762 --> 25:03.762
to counterbalance
your sister's influence,

25:03.797 --> 25:06.331
which is a result
of your longtime, well,

25:06.366 --> 25:08.266
low-level exposure to her.

25:13.606 --> 25:17.909
So you really...
Think you can help her?

25:17.943 --> 25:21.112
We can end this.

25:21.146 --> 25:22.613
But...

25:24.616 --> 25:27.751
Only if we can find her,
Matthew.

25:31.456 --> 25:33.023
This is
a waste of time.

25:33.058 --> 25:34.158
Why doesn't Rosen
just have you go in there

25:34.192 --> 25:35.259
and push this kid?

25:35.294 --> 25:37.795
My ability only lasts
for a few minutes.

25:37.829 --> 25:39.964
Besides, Rosen doesn't like
to work that way.

25:39.998 --> 25:42.299
I mean, his heartbeat is
regular, he sounds sincere.

25:42.334 --> 25:45.303
So speaks
the human lie detector.

25:45.337 --> 25:46.771
Agent Wilson.

25:46.806 --> 25:48.240
Your security is pathetic.

25:48.274 --> 25:49.675
Well...

25:49.709 --> 25:52.344
Bill, Agent Wilson's here.

25:52.379 --> 25:53.379
Where's Rosen?

25:53.413 --> 25:55.414
How the hell
did you get in here?

25:55.449 --> 25:57.651
Oh, you're good.

25:57.685 --> 25:59.086
I miss Agent Sullivan.

25:59.120 --> 26:00.254
She was nicer.

26:02.623 --> 26:04.491
I'll be right back,
Matthew.

26:06.694 --> 26:08.261
Don, hey,
I asked you for more time.

26:08.295 --> 26:10.030
And I hung up
on you, Lee,

26:10.064 --> 26:11.698
'cause it's your job
to keep me happy.

26:11.733 --> 26:13.734
We're making progress.
He's beginning to trust me.

26:13.768 --> 26:15.469
My trust is
what's important here.

26:15.503 --> 26:16.870
Your entire operation
hangs on my good nature.

26:16.905 --> 26:17.971
Now, what do
you got for me?

26:18.005 --> 26:19.672
Well, quite a lot, actually.

26:19.707 --> 26:21.340
And if you just let me finish
what I started here,

26:21.375 --> 26:22.942
I think I can win
his complete cooperation.

26:22.976 --> 26:25.545
What I need is his sister
in Binghamton yesterday.

26:25.579 --> 26:27.146
Before she can add
to her body count.

26:27.180 --> 26:29.581
What's Binghamton?

26:32.484 --> 26:35.252
Um, it's a place where
your sister can get some help.

26:35.287 --> 26:36.687
Doesn't sound like that.

26:36.722 --> 26:38.256
It sounds like a prison.
No.

26:38.290 --> 26:40.224
- You're gonna lock her away.
- Matthew--

26:40.258 --> 26:41.292
No one's gonna
pin a medal to her chest

26:41.326 --> 26:42.326
for what she's done.

26:42.361 --> 26:43.761
I found her.

26:43.795 --> 26:45.396
I found her,
I found your sister.

26:45.430 --> 26:47.665
Someone using the name
Tracy Beaumont

26:47.699 --> 26:50.201
just bought a bus ticket
to Chicago.

26:50.235 --> 26:52.504
She got an email confirmation.

26:52.538 --> 26:55.039
It leaves from
downtown Yonkers at 6:00 am.

26:55.073 --> 26:56.674
It--it's buzzing.

26:56.708 --> 26:58.275
Score one for <i>Rain Man.</i>

26:58.310 --> 26:59.410
Rain--that's a movie.

26:59.444 --> 27:00.578
I'm not allowed
to watch that.

27:00.612 --> 27:01.679
Gary--okay, okay.

27:01.714 --> 27:02.714
We won't be
needing you anymore.

27:02.748 --> 27:04.416
You have to
take me with you.

27:04.450 --> 27:05.450
I can stop her
if you take me with you.

27:05.484 --> 27:06.684
- Calm down.
- You'll get hurt.

27:06.719 --> 27:07.752
What does that mean?
I'm gonna get hurt--

27:07.786 --> 27:08.887
I need to stop her.

27:08.921 --> 27:10.121
We need to slow down
a minute, please.

27:10.156 --> 27:11.256
- Look, I got this, I got this!
- I can stop her.

27:11.290 --> 27:14.393
- Doc, doc.
- Like you knew this before?

27:14.427 --> 27:16.095
Mom,
why are you still awake?

27:16.129 --> 27:18.031
It's not even light out.

27:18.065 --> 27:19.865
No, I'm awake
because of my job.

27:19.900 --> 27:21.934
- That's Matthew's sister.
- What?

27:21.968 --> 27:23.035
This is Matthew's sister?

27:23.069 --> 27:25.570
That is not the girl
on the subway.

27:25.605 --> 27:27.505
- Then he's lying.
- Exactly.

27:27.540 --> 27:29.073
- I'm going with you!
- I-I found her.

27:29.108 --> 27:31.008
That's what I do
for a living.

27:31.043 --> 27:32.876
Gary.
Gary.

27:32.911 --> 27:35.145
- Yeah.
- Don.

27:35.179 --> 27:36.146
Look--

27:36.180 --> 27:37.747
Don, please would you--

27:37.781 --> 27:39.816
No, no, no,
you can't do this.

27:39.850 --> 27:41.050
You can't do this!
Whoa, there.

27:41.085 --> 27:42.619
- Don't touch him!
- You can't do this!

27:42.653 --> 27:44.087
No!

27:44.122 --> 27:47.191
Aaaah!

28:00.974 --> 28:02.341
Aaaarrrghh!

28:14.119 --> 28:15.553
Aah! I hate it!

28:30.270 --> 28:33.206
I don't want to live
with you anymore!

28:39.013 --> 28:40.614
Rachel! Rachel!

29:11.011 --> 29:12.212
Stop!

29:12.246 --> 29:13.246
Gary!

29:14.682 --> 29:16.050
Freeze!

29:16.084 --> 29:18.052
Hey! Stop!

29:19.254 --> 29:21.489
Stop!

29:21.523 --> 29:24.325
Aarrgh!

29:24.359 --> 29:27.461
Unh! Unh! Unh!

29:27.495 --> 29:29.430
Aaarrghh!

29:51.956 --> 29:53.256
What's happening?

29:53.290 --> 29:54.257
I got angry.

29:54.291 --> 29:55.725
It's all right, Gary.

29:55.759 --> 29:56.993
We all did.

29:57.027 --> 29:59.062
- Where's Matthew?
- I don't know.

29:59.096 --> 30:00.463
Unh!

30:19.520 --> 30:21.321
I don't know
why I did it.

30:21.355 --> 30:24.224
I don't know why...

30:31.799 --> 30:33.934
He's dead.

30:46.246 --> 30:47.380
Copy that.

30:47.414 --> 30:49.081
Containment crew inbound.

30:49.115 --> 30:51.083
Eta, 16 minutes.

31:02.229 --> 31:03.529
You ready?

31:03.563 --> 31:06.165
Almost.

31:06.200 --> 31:08.535
Don Wilson was not
an easy guy,

31:08.569 --> 31:11.238
but he did not deserve
to die like that.

31:11.272 --> 31:13.107
Doc, do you have any idea
why that kid's ability

31:13.141 --> 31:14.508
didn't work on me?

31:14.543 --> 31:17.045
I mean, everybody else was
going crazy, and I felt fine.

31:17.079 --> 31:18.446
Exactly.

31:18.480 --> 31:20.682
Exactly what?

31:20.716 --> 31:23.217
Why did they put the sheet
on Agent Wilson?

31:23.252 --> 31:25.219
It just--it got all bloody,
and it was red.

31:25.254 --> 31:27.455
I can still
smell the blood.

31:27.490 --> 31:29.457
I never knew
what it felt like.

31:29.492 --> 31:32.660
To be forced to do something
against your will like that.

31:32.695 --> 31:34.462
I mean,
when I push people--

31:34.496 --> 31:36.697
No, it's not the same.

31:37.966 --> 31:39.233
All right, um--

31:39.267 --> 31:41.536
Dr. Rosen, I'm sorry.
I need to go home.

31:41.571 --> 31:42.604
Of course, I understand.

31:42.638 --> 31:43.604
Go.

31:43.639 --> 31:45.540
You gotta get
your nose looked after.

31:45.575 --> 31:46.608
It can wait.

31:46.642 --> 31:48.176
Nina, will you
take Gary home, please?

31:48.211 --> 31:50.713
- You sure?
- Yes.

31:52.216 --> 31:53.483
Uh, Mr. Hicks,

31:53.517 --> 31:57.054
we need to find Matthew
before Wilson's people do.

31:57.088 --> 31:59.022
Bill can control his own
fight or flight reflexes.

31:59.057 --> 32:01.024
I think I have a way
to control yours.

32:01.059 --> 32:02.025
Serotonin.

32:02.059 --> 32:03.893
Sit down, please.
Yeah.

32:19.908 --> 32:21.675
Tracy.

32:21.709 --> 32:23.610
Why did you run?

32:23.645 --> 32:25.012
- Matthew.
- Hi.

32:25.046 --> 32:28.115
What are you doing here?
Why are you here?

32:28.150 --> 32:30.284
We're going to Chicago, right?
Let's buy me a ticket.

32:30.319 --> 32:31.719
No.
Matthew, no.

32:31.753 --> 32:34.088
That's not
a good idea, okay?

32:34.123 --> 32:35.524
- We can't stay here.
- Shh, I know.

32:35.558 --> 32:37.092
We always said we would
get out of arden together.

32:37.126 --> 32:39.528
That was before
everything happened, okay?

32:39.563 --> 32:41.897
You think I hurt all
those people for no reason?

32:41.931 --> 32:43.331
It was because of you--
for you, for us.

32:43.366 --> 32:44.933
Calm down, please.

32:44.968 --> 32:46.768
You're the only one that
doesn't get crazy around me.

32:46.803 --> 32:47.936
- We're supposed to be together.
- I can't.

32:47.970 --> 32:49.271
All the fights at school

32:49.305 --> 32:51.606
and what happened
to your sister.

32:51.640 --> 32:54.275
- No, Tracy, that was not me.
- And now these riots.

32:54.309 --> 32:57.244
Matthew, people died.

32:57.278 --> 32:58.578
Okay? You killed them.

32:58.613 --> 33:00.580
No, I haven't killed anybody.
Tracy, listen to me.

33:00.615 --> 33:02.582
Listen, I didn't
run away from Arden.

33:02.617 --> 33:04.151
I ran away from you.

33:04.185 --> 33:05.519
Tracy--

33:05.554 --> 33:07.488
Matthew!

33:07.522 --> 33:09.824
Let her go--let her go.

33:09.858 --> 33:11.459
Everybody back up, FBI!

33:11.493 --> 33:12.927
- Come on, move, move, move!
- FBI! Out of the building, now!

33:12.961 --> 33:14.629
- Stay away!
- Calm down.

33:14.663 --> 33:15.863
I will start a riot,
and I won't stop

33:15.898 --> 33:17.365
until a lot
of people are dead.

33:17.399 --> 33:18.633
Listen to me,
don't make it any worse

33:18.667 --> 33:20.968
than it already is--
get out of the building now!

33:21.003 --> 33:22.937
Matthew, please!
Do as they say, please!

33:22.971 --> 33:24.839
Matthew,
listen to your friend.

33:24.873 --> 33:26.040
Don't you see
you're making me do this?

33:26.075 --> 33:28.276
No, Matthew,
you control it, okay?

33:28.311 --> 33:29.511
Don't do this.

33:29.545 --> 33:31.113
- You make it happen.
- Don't do it.

33:31.147 --> 33:32.281
- I'm doing this for you.
- No.

33:32.315 --> 33:33.615
I'm doing this for you.

33:33.650 --> 33:35.217
No, I don't
want you to do this.

33:36.219 --> 33:38.454
Matthew, stop!

33:44.460 --> 33:46.862
No! No! No!

33:49.932 --> 33:52.133
Get off of me!

33:53.435 --> 33:55.536
Go, Harken, go!
I can get her!

34:16.193 --> 34:17.360
No!

34:17.395 --> 34:19.329
Unh!

34:23.199 --> 34:24.734
Tracy!

34:32.310 --> 34:34.011
Come on, come on!

34:38.583 --> 34:40.284
Hey, close your eyes.

34:39.318 --> 34:41.719
What?

34:47.994 --> 34:50.262
Unh! Aah!

34:54.498 --> 34:56.900
How did we get up here?

35:00.572 --> 35:02.273
Watch out,
watch out, watch out.

35:20.258 --> 35:21.959
Matthew.

35:21.994 --> 35:23.261
You got nowhere to go.

35:23.295 --> 35:25.864
Give up before
anyone else gets hurt.

35:43.652 --> 35:44.919
Come here!

35:44.954 --> 35:47.788
Leave me alone!

35:47.823 --> 35:50.458
Can't do that.

35:57.265 --> 36:00.300
I trust Matthew
made it to Binghamton safely.

36:00.334 --> 36:01.834
Yes, Dr. Rosen.

36:01.869 --> 36:03.536
Matthew Hurley
is safely tucked away.

36:03.570 --> 36:05.404
So let me
get this straight.

36:05.438 --> 36:06.805
Me and my tactical team

36:06.840 --> 36:08.508
have to drug ourselves
every time we handle this kid?

36:08.542 --> 36:10.777
Either that
or use a Hazmat suit.

36:13.247 --> 36:14.848
What was that, Cley?

36:14.883 --> 36:17.785
Someone else's problem.
I'm tactical.

36:17.819 --> 36:20.388
So back to these injections.

36:20.422 --> 36:21.389
Can we use
a smaller needle?

36:21.423 --> 36:22.991
That was
like a horse shot.

36:23.025 --> 36:24.826
My people didn't complain.

36:24.860 --> 36:27.162
Yeah, well, sue me.
I'm human.

36:27.196 --> 36:30.699
And so are they.

36:30.734 --> 36:33.201
And so is Matthew Hurley.

36:33.236 --> 36:34.870
And you need to
treat them as such.

36:34.904 --> 36:37.605
Do I tell you
how to do your job?

36:37.639 --> 36:38.839
How about this?

36:38.873 --> 36:43.076
Don't get your
next handler killed.

36:43.111 --> 36:44.578
That was uncalled for.

36:46.280 --> 36:47.647
Don Wilson thought
he could do his job

36:47.682 --> 36:49.249
with his eyes half shut.

36:49.284 --> 36:50.851
He botched
the red flag roll-up

36:50.885 --> 36:52.586
and almost got
you and yours killed.

36:52.621 --> 36:53.721
Twice.

36:53.755 --> 36:55.289
Don't kid yourself, Doc.

36:55.323 --> 36:57.992
This situation,
it's getting worse.

36:58.027 --> 37:00.829
Sounds like the stress
is getting to you.

37:00.863 --> 37:03.231
Would you like to
schedule a session?

37:05.001 --> 37:06.101
Only therapy I need is

37:06.135 --> 37:09.571
a week in Orlando
with my wife and kids.

37:09.605 --> 37:11.639
You wanna bury your head
in the sand, be my guest.

37:11.673 --> 37:12.640
Me?

37:12.674 --> 37:15.576
I'm tired
and my arm hurts.

37:15.610 --> 37:18.278
So we're done here.

37:20.181 --> 37:23.283
Apparently so.

38:12.433 --> 38:15.735
- Hey, Rach.
- Hey, Nina.

38:15.769 --> 38:19.004
Feeling any better?

38:19.038 --> 38:21.240
You were pretty shaken up.

38:21.274 --> 38:24.242
I don't know anymore.

38:24.277 --> 38:26.745
You know,
Agent Wilson creeped me out.

38:26.779 --> 38:30.949
Did you know that he smelled
like stomach acid and Tums?

38:30.983 --> 38:32.384
And now that he's dead,

38:32.418 --> 38:36.421
I feel bad that I didn't like
the way the guy smelled.

38:36.455 --> 38:38.423
I've been trying to forget
it ever happened.

38:38.458 --> 38:40.091
How's that working out?

38:40.126 --> 38:42.060
Not so well.

38:42.094 --> 38:44.195
When I was upset,
I told my mother...

38:44.229 --> 38:46.230
To shut her mouth.

38:46.265 --> 38:50.402
And that I hated her,
and that I was moving out.

38:50.436 --> 38:52.003
I'm glad something good
came out of it.

38:52.038 --> 38:54.907
Nina.

38:54.941 --> 38:56.608
What are you gonna do?

38:56.643 --> 38:58.877
I'm gonna
stay with my cousin.

38:58.912 --> 39:02.080
She said I could live
on her couch for a little while.

39:02.115 --> 39:03.615
Comfortable.

39:06.886 --> 39:09.055
Look...

39:09.089 --> 39:12.025
I have a three-bedroom loft
in Soho.

39:12.059 --> 39:14.027
Free rent.

39:14.061 --> 39:15.729
You can stay with me
at least until

39:15.763 --> 39:19.132
you figure something out.

39:19.166 --> 39:22.635
I don't wanna impose.

39:22.669 --> 39:26.505
I think we both
could use the company.

39:26.540 --> 39:28.674
Oh, there you are.

39:28.708 --> 39:31.510
Uh, I'd like everyone
in my office.

39:31.544 --> 39:33.678
Okay.

39:37.883 --> 39:39.651
Here we go again.

39:40.886 --> 39:43.687
Bill, I know what happened
is very disturbing

39:43.722 --> 39:44.888
to all of us,

39:44.923 --> 39:47.057
especially what happened
to Don Wilson.

39:47.091 --> 39:49.393
But it's understandable,
if you--

39:49.428 --> 39:51.830
Yeah, people are there,
and then they're not.

39:51.864 --> 39:53.398
And they bashed his brain in
with a chair--

39:53.433 --> 39:56.335
- Gary, please--Gary, stop!
- Gary, Gary.

39:56.369 --> 39:59.105
Gary, Don Wilson
was a federal agent who died

39:59.139 --> 40:00.206
doing his job, okay?

40:00.241 --> 40:01.408
You should have
a little respect.

40:01.442 --> 40:02.776
- Bill, just let it go.
- Bill, it's all right.

40:02.810 --> 40:05.846
Let what go?
He should learn to respect--

40:05.880 --> 40:07.948
Gary has his own way
of expressing grief.

40:07.983 --> 40:09.183
Yeah,
that's just my way.

40:09.217 --> 40:10.284
People are there,
and then they're not.

40:10.318 --> 40:12.419
As do we all
have our own ways

40:12.454 --> 40:14.589
of dealing with
a traumatic experience.

40:14.623 --> 40:17.993
Listen, I don't just wanna
talk about Don Wilson.

40:18.027 --> 40:19.227
I wanna talk about us.

40:19.262 --> 40:20.896
Is there still an us?

40:20.930 --> 40:23.032
With Wilson gone?

40:23.066 --> 40:26.101
Uh, yes, Nina,
there's still going to be an us.

40:26.136 --> 40:27.603
They are not going to
disband our team.

40:27.637 --> 40:30.239
Agent Sullivan is probably
going to replace Wilson.

40:30.273 --> 40:34.911
You know, Don Wilson died
partially because he did not

40:34.945 --> 40:37.447
give us the trust
that he should have.

40:37.482 --> 40:40.251
We stopped Matthew
when no one else could.

40:40.285 --> 40:42.487
So yes, we will go on.

40:42.521 --> 40:44.455
And we'll do more than that.

40:44.490 --> 40:46.257
We'll thrive...

40:46.292 --> 40:47.258
As a team.

40:47.293 --> 40:49.793
And we will, uh...

40:49.828 --> 40:55.365
We will deal with what life
and our handlers throw our way.

40:55.400 --> 40:56.900
Which means
stopping more Alphas.

40:56.934 --> 40:59.335
The Ghost,
Marcus, Matthew.

40:59.370 --> 41:01.804
You know, nobody can do
what we can do.

41:01.839 --> 41:03.773
And it's gonna be messy.

41:03.807 --> 41:05.675
I'm not saying
we won't make mistakes.

41:05.709 --> 41:07.844
I mean, none of us are trained
for this kind of thing,

41:07.878 --> 41:10.214
Bill being the exception.

41:10.248 --> 41:12.883
But you know,
nobody can deal with

41:12.918 --> 41:14.285
the Alpha phenomenon
like we can.

41:14.319 --> 41:16.020
So life on
the cutting edge, huh?

41:16.054 --> 41:17.021
Uh, yeah.

41:17.056 --> 41:18.356
Not for
the faint of heart.

41:18.391 --> 41:19.357
Life...

41:19.392 --> 41:20.992
Life is hard.

41:21.027 --> 41:23.095
There's death.

41:23.129 --> 41:24.797
And everybody dies.

41:24.831 --> 41:26.165
And...

41:26.200 --> 41:28.234
- Gary.
- It's still humming.

41:28.268 --> 41:29.368
There's still a hum.

41:29.402 --> 41:30.836
We've caught Matthew.

41:30.871 --> 41:33.172
But no one has helped me
with the humming.

41:33.206 --> 41:35.040
No one.

41:42.313 --> 41:44.180
Hey, Gary.

41:44.215 --> 41:45.548
Yes.

41:45.582 --> 41:48.418
Come on,
come take a walk with me.

41:48.452 --> 41:49.819
Come on.

41:53.458 --> 41:55.425
It's that one--
it's the ugly gray one.

41:55.460 --> 41:57.427
- You sure?
- The ugly gray one, yeah.

41:57.462 --> 41:58.529
Okay.

41:58.563 --> 42:00.298
Here, stand over here.

42:07.240 --> 42:09.308
Watch this.

42:12.713 --> 42:14.581
- No, that's the wrong way.
- Wait for it.

42:27.161 --> 42:29.796
- No more buzz.
- That's right.

42:29.831 --> 42:31.198
Come on, what do you say,
we'll go inside

42:31.232 --> 42:33.300
and we'll, uh,
we'll worry about our future.

42:33.335 --> 42:35.269
I'm not worried.

== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

42:38.573 --> 42:40.741
Yeah, me neither.
