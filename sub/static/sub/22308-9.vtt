WEBVTT

00:01.006 --> 00:03.408
I am absolutely thrilled.

00:03.443 --> 00:04.709
It's very problematic.

00:04.744 --> 00:06.545
(Ve) On a scale of one to
ten in the creepiness,

00:06.579 --> 00:07.546
he is a 15 1/2.

00:07.580 --> 00:08.880
Thank you.

00:08.915 --> 00:10.515
(McKenzie)
Previously on <i> Face Off...</i>

00:10.550 --> 00:13.919
Ben's futuristic villain
brought him his second win.

00:13.953 --> 00:15.720
But Jamie was eliminated,

00:15.755 --> 00:19.391
leaving Team Anthony
with just two artists.

00:21.360 --> 00:24.262
Now eight artists remain,
and tonight,

00:24.297 --> 00:27.432
they strive to win two
incredibly colorful challenges.

00:27.467 --> 00:30.735
Please give a warm welcome
to Gabriela Isler.

00:30.770 --> 00:32.537
This is the best challenge.

00:32.572 --> 00:33.905
Oh, what?

00:33.940 --> 00:36.508
It's the crappiest situation
you can be in right now.

00:40.179 --> 00:42.080
The forms are just stunning.

00:42.115 --> 00:43.482
(McKenzie)
In the end, only one

00:43.516 --> 00:46.118
will win a VIP trip from
Kryolan Professional Make-Up

00:46.152 --> 00:48.854
to one of their 85
international locations,

00:48.888 --> 00:51.790
a brand-new 2015 Fiat 500,

00:51.824 --> 00:54.059
and $100,000.

00:55.761 --> 00:57.762
This is <i> Face Off.</i>

01:00.700 --> 01:03.668

01:39.872 --> 01:41.373
(Emily) You'll be fine
in the next challenge.

01:41.407 --> 01:43.241
Yeah, I'll just...
I'll bounce back this time.

01:43.276 --> 01:45.978
It was just not good for me
last challenge.

01:46.012 --> 01:48.613
I don't want to be on the bottom
continuously.

01:48.648 --> 01:51.049
I want to show the judges
that I have cool ideas

01:51.084 --> 01:53.218
and the technical skills
to do it.

01:53.252 --> 01:54.753
You'll be fine.

01:54.787 --> 01:56.288
(Stephanie) I'm thrilled
I didn't get sent home,

01:56.322 --> 01:59.291
'cause now I can redeem myself
with a better makeup this time.

01:59.325 --> 02:01.760
This competition
is getting way harder now,

02:01.794 --> 02:04.262
so I got to keep on trucking
if I want to win.

02:12.405 --> 02:15.674
- This is so pretty.
- Dolphins.

02:15.708 --> 02:16.808
(Emily)
We're in Long Beach.

02:16.843 --> 02:18.977
The sand's nice,
and we see dolphins,

02:19.012 --> 02:20.946
but I have no idea
what we're doing.

02:20.980 --> 02:22.981
I hope we don't have
to run in the sand.

02:23.016 --> 02:25.250
We walk up to McKenzie,
and she's standing

02:25.284 --> 02:27.285
near a bunch of models.

02:27.320 --> 02:28.620
(woman)
What's next to them?

02:28.654 --> 02:30.422
(Darla) And there's
tables set up with bowls,

02:30.456 --> 02:31.890
but I can't see what's in them.

02:31.924 --> 02:34.192
I don't see any makeup kits.

02:34.227 --> 02:37.029
I'm not entirely sure
what's happening.

02:37.063 --> 02:38.030
(woman)
All right.

02:38.064 --> 02:39.331
Hey, everybody.

02:39.365 --> 02:40.399
(all)
Hello.

02:40.433 --> 02:41.666
Today's Foundation Challenge

02:41.701 --> 02:43.035
is gonna be a blast.

02:43.069 --> 02:46.271
It's inspired by an ancient
Hindu religious festival

02:46.305 --> 02:48.707
celebrated all over the world

02:48.741 --> 02:51.076
as winter ends
and spring emerges

02:51.110 --> 02:53.445
with its abundance
of beautiful colors,

02:53.479 --> 02:55.280
the Holi Festival.

02:55.314 --> 02:56.448
(Stephanie)
Yes!

02:56.482 --> 02:57.549
I immediately know
what we're doing.

02:57.583 --> 02:58.984
This is gonna be so cool.

02:59.018 --> 03:02.454
Commonly referred to
as the Festival of Colors,

03:02.488 --> 03:04.489
people gather with friends
in city streets,

03:04.524 --> 03:05.624
religious temples,

03:05.658 --> 03:07.893
and even beaches like this
to celebrate

03:07.927 --> 03:10.362
by hurling colored Holi powder
at each other

03:10.396 --> 03:12.864
in a chaotic spectacle of color.

03:12.899 --> 03:16.435
So with immunity
on the line today...

03:16.469 --> 03:17.636
Oh, my goodness.

03:17.670 --> 03:19.004
Your Foundation Challenge

03:19.038 --> 03:22.441
is to create your own colorful
and beautiful makeup

03:22.475 --> 03:25.243
that represents spring.

03:25.278 --> 03:28.947
However, you will not have
your makeup kits, brushes,

03:28.981 --> 03:32.417
or fabrication materials
for this challenge.

03:32.452 --> 03:35.487
You can only use your hands.

03:35.521 --> 03:37.389
(Ben)
There's only eight artists left,

03:37.423 --> 03:39.424
so immunity
is extremely important,

03:39.459 --> 03:42.094
but now we're not even gonna
get to use any brushes.

03:42.128 --> 03:44.162
Talk about holy shit.

03:44.197 --> 03:45.297
Now, the workstations

03:45.331 --> 03:47.933
each have seven different colors
of Holi powder,

03:47.967 --> 03:50.735
and you'll have two hours
for this challenge.

03:50.770 --> 03:53.605
On my go, I want you to select
a model and get started.

03:53.639 --> 03:54.606
You guys ready?

03:54.640 --> 03:55.607
(woman)
Oh, God.

03:55.641 --> 03:56.608
Go!

03:56.642 --> 03:57.709
(Emily)
McKenzie says go,

03:57.743 --> 03:59.111
and I feel like
I'm running for my life.

03:59.145 --> 04:00.612
Hi.

04:00.646 --> 04:02.314
What's up, dude?

04:02.348 --> 04:04.649
This is for not winning
the last challenge.

04:04.684 --> 04:06.251
[laughter]

04:06.285 --> 04:08.353
This is more difficult
than I'd expected.

04:08.387 --> 04:10.188
The powder keeps blowing
in the wind

04:10.223 --> 04:12.457
and back into our faces.

04:12.492 --> 04:14.192
But it's sticking, and it's fun.

04:14.227 --> 04:16.695
[laughing]

04:16.728 --> 04:19.331
(Kelly)
I'm going for an Indian goddess.

04:19.365 --> 04:21.565
I want to represent
the warmth inside her

04:21.601 --> 04:23.702
that's pushing out
all of this cold.

04:23.736 --> 04:27.439
So I'm using warms in the middle
and fading it out to purples,

04:27.473 --> 04:29.074
and I think it makes her
like a goddess.

04:29.108 --> 04:30.876
She's looking cool.

04:30.910 --> 04:33.178
(Adam) The phoenix symbolizes
rising from the ashes,

04:33.212 --> 04:35.180
the dead of winter
coming into spring.

04:35.214 --> 04:37.816
So he's gonna be a phoenix.

04:37.850 --> 04:39.651
I'm gonna do
a henna pattern to it.

04:39.685 --> 04:41.219
Ooh, that's so pretty.

04:41.254 --> 04:42.354
(Emily)
I wipe my finger,

04:42.388 --> 04:44.956
and I start cleaning the pathway
for my pattern,

04:44.991 --> 04:46.925
and it's working beautifully.

04:46.959 --> 04:49.060
Is this wet?
I see what you're doing.

04:49.095 --> 04:51.997
I'm going for a sunset
on a beach...

04:52.031 --> 04:54.466
That's the sun.

04:54.500 --> 04:56.434
With a palm tree and a river.

04:56.469 --> 04:58.303
These are all spring things
to me.

04:58.337 --> 05:00.972
I'm trying to make leaves.

05:02.875 --> 05:04.042
(Darla)
I don't necessarily have, like,

05:04.076 --> 05:05.677
a specific character concept,

05:05.711 --> 05:07.746
but I'm pulling
color inspiration

05:07.780 --> 05:09.381
from sunsets and sunrises.

05:09.415 --> 05:11.116
So I'm trying
to do some nice blending,

05:11.150 --> 05:14.386
and then I dip Matt's fingers
in the orange powder

05:14.420 --> 05:18.356
to create this feeling
of energy coming into the world.

05:18.391 --> 05:20.091
That's kind of cool.

05:20.126 --> 05:23.361
I want to show the battle
between winter and spring,

05:23.396 --> 05:25.530
so I'm doing a lot
of bright spring colors

05:25.565 --> 05:27.566
bleeding into the blues
and purples

05:27.600 --> 05:29.467
to convey a story through colors

05:29.502 --> 05:31.336
instead of, like,
a literal design.

05:31.370 --> 05:32.737
Sweet.

05:32.772 --> 05:34.940
I have no concept at all.

05:34.974 --> 05:36.608
I'm just going with
the colors of spring

05:36.642 --> 05:38.877
and letting it
go abstract and crazy.

05:38.911 --> 05:41.379
I'm having so much fun
with this challenge.

05:41.414 --> 05:42.480
Ugh!

05:42.515 --> 05:44.115
[laughter]

05:44.150 --> 05:45.717
Never seen Ben look so happy.

05:45.751 --> 05:47.519
He always looks angry,
except for now.

05:48.788 --> 05:50.722
I'm putting angel wings
on your back.

05:50.756 --> 05:53.558
I'm thinking that maybe she's
the angel of spring,

05:53.593 --> 05:55.093
and she floats around,

05:55.127 --> 05:57.095
and she's just
this heavenly being.

05:57.129 --> 05:59.464
Bam.

05:59.498 --> 06:00.966
15 minutes, guys.

06:09.442 --> 06:11.943
Time's up.
Hands and powder down.

06:11.978 --> 06:13.645
All right.

06:13.679 --> 06:14.980
Now, I'm sure you're wondering

06:15.014 --> 06:17.882
who's gonna judge
this challenge.

06:17.917 --> 06:20.185
Well, I have a big surprise
for you.

06:20.219 --> 06:23.321
Your coaches will be the ones
judging this challenge

06:23.356 --> 06:25.156
and awarding
one of you immunity.

06:25.191 --> 06:26.458
Holy crap.

06:26.492 --> 06:27.993
Now, I'm gonna separate
you guys from your makeup,

06:28.027 --> 06:29.561
so it's gonna be a blind pick

06:29.595 --> 06:31.963
based solely on the work
in front of them.

06:31.998 --> 06:34.165
So why don't you guys
go ahead and step to the side,

06:34.200 --> 06:35.834
and I'll bring in the coaches.

06:39.939 --> 06:40.905
Welcome, coaches.

06:40.940 --> 06:42.040
- Hello.
- Hi, McKenzie.

06:42.074 --> 06:43.275
Ready to check out some makeups?

06:43.309 --> 06:44.342
- Oh, yeah.
- Absolutely.

06:48.281 --> 06:51.383
I like the negative space,
how they put on all the color

06:51.417 --> 06:53.952
and they took away
for the details.

06:55.755 --> 06:57.355
Cool thing I really like,
whoever did this

06:57.390 --> 06:59.190
put down their base tones
and came with, like,

06:59.225 --> 07:01.660
a wet finger
to create all the streaking.

07:01.694 --> 07:03.561
Yet there's no green
or anything in it.

07:05.698 --> 07:08.800
They really played up the whole
Hindu, Indian feel of it.

07:08.834 --> 07:10.068
(McKenzie)
Love the lotus flower.

07:12.204 --> 07:13.872
The fingers
are very, very bright,

07:13.906 --> 07:16.274
as if they're radiating
some sort of energy.

07:18.077 --> 07:19.577
I think the face
is absolutely beautiful.

07:19.612 --> 07:21.546
You know, the contours
are coming through.

07:24.016 --> 07:25.016
Because they brought in

07:25.051 --> 07:26.551
the orange and the yellows
through here

07:26.585 --> 07:28.520
actually make it look
like there's a light.

07:28.554 --> 07:30.088
It's like...
it's really cool.

07:30.122 --> 07:34.426
The gradation between
the seasonal change as well.

07:36.996 --> 07:39.331
Now, there's nice attention
to where the color is

07:39.365 --> 07:41.366
and keeping it light
in the center of the body.

07:41.400 --> 07:42.367
- I like it.
- Awesome.

07:42.401 --> 07:43.935
Thank you very much.

07:43.969 --> 07:47.038
(McKenzie) All right, guys, after
we inspected your makeups,

07:47.073 --> 07:49.407
the coaches
did choose a favorite.

07:49.442 --> 07:51.643
They still don't know
whose creation it is,

07:51.677 --> 07:53.712
but I do.

07:53.746 --> 07:56.247
The winner of today's
Foundation Challenge

07:56.282 --> 07:58.316
and the prize of immunity is...

08:01.187 --> 08:02.487
Stephanie.

08:02.521 --> 08:03.488
[gasps]

08:03.522 --> 08:06.991
[cheers and applause]

08:07.026 --> 08:08.993
Congratulations.
How's that feel?

08:09.028 --> 08:11.329
That feels awesome.
Yes!

08:11.364 --> 08:13.098
I really like the treatment
of the blue

08:13.132 --> 08:14.999
in transition with the orange.

08:15.034 --> 08:17.936
It felt like bounce light
from a two-dimensional painting.

08:17.970 --> 08:19.104
Thanks.

08:19.138 --> 08:21.005
It's a huge relief
to have immunity.

08:21.040 --> 08:23.074
Now, no matter what,
I'm gonna be in the next round.

08:23.109 --> 08:24.242
All right, guys,

08:24.276 --> 08:25.710
head back to the house
and get cleaned up.

08:25.745 --> 08:27.879
I'll see you tomorrow for
your next Spotlight Challenge.

08:27.913 --> 08:28.947
(man)
See you.

08:41.427 --> 08:42.794
This is so weird.

08:42.828 --> 08:44.963
We're at the stage,
and it's freaking me out

08:44.997 --> 08:47.098
because this
is where people go home,

08:47.133 --> 08:49.868
and I see these dress forms
onstage.

08:49.902 --> 08:51.336
This is bizarre.

08:52.671 --> 08:53.638
Hey, guys.

08:53.672 --> 08:55.073
- Hey.
- Hello.

08:55.107 --> 08:57.208
Welcome to the reveal stage.

08:57.243 --> 08:58.877
I know, normally,
this is a place

08:58.911 --> 09:00.712
reserved for elimination,
but don't worry.

09:00.746 --> 09:03.248
None of you
are going home today.

09:03.282 --> 09:05.950
Instead, I've bought you here
to talk about your next

09:05.985 --> 09:07.752
Spotlight Challenge.

09:07.787 --> 09:11.055
While aliens are often portrayed
as hideous creatures,

09:11.090 --> 09:13.324
films like <i> Avatar</i> and <i> Species</i>

09:13.359 --> 09:16.594
have embraced the sexy side
of extraterrestrials,

09:16.629 --> 09:18.897
transforming them
from bug-eyed monsters

09:18.931 --> 09:20.899
into out-of-this-world beauties.

09:20.933 --> 09:23.301
So this week's
Spotlight Challenge

09:23.335 --> 09:27.205
is to create
your very own beautiful alien.

09:28.340 --> 09:29.307
Okay.

09:29.341 --> 09:30.708
Cool.

09:30.743 --> 09:34.012
I know beauty makeup very well,
so I feel pretty good with this.

09:34.046 --> 09:36.314
I'd like to introduce you
to a very special guest

09:36.348 --> 09:38.850
who definitely knows
a thing or two about beauty.

09:38.884 --> 09:40.819
She's a fashion model
and beauty queen

09:40.853 --> 09:43.321
who became Miss Venezuela
in 2012

09:43.355 --> 09:47.158
and was then crowned
Miss Universe in 2013.

09:47.193 --> 09:50.695
Please give a warm welcome
to Gabriela Isler.

09:50.729 --> 09:54.566
[applause]

09:54.600 --> 09:56.468
(Darla) It's so cool to
have Miss Universe here

09:56.502 --> 09:58.736
because she knows
all about beauty,

09:58.771 --> 10:00.238
so I think this challenge
is gonna be fun.

10:00.272 --> 10:01.239
Hello.

10:01.273 --> 10:02.373
Hello.
Thank you for having me.

10:02.408 --> 10:03.374
(McKenzie) It's an
honor and a pleasure.

10:03.409 --> 10:04.576
I'm so excited.

10:04.610 --> 10:06.578
Now, you've won
multiple crowns in your career,

10:06.612 --> 10:08.146
so what advice
can you give these guys

10:08.180 --> 10:10.949
to make sure that their aliens
are truly beautiful?

10:10.983 --> 10:13.518
Beauty pageant
is not just about beauty.

10:13.552 --> 10:16.020
It's the way that you
present yourself.

10:16.055 --> 10:17.288
Have some fun.

10:17.323 --> 10:19.424
Put your friendly attitude
in every single makeup

10:19.458 --> 10:20.692
and enjoy.

10:20.726 --> 10:22.794
Fantastic advice.
Thank you.

10:22.828 --> 10:25.964
All right, guys,
in the Miss Universe Pageant,

10:25.998 --> 10:30.835
all of its participants hail
from the same planet, Earth.

10:30.870 --> 10:34.906
This week, we're going
to broaden that competition.

10:34.940 --> 10:36.508
(Emily)
If this is what I think it is,

10:36.542 --> 10:39.511
this could be the best challenge
<i>Face Off</i> ever.

10:39.545 --> 10:41.145
[laughs]

10:43.982 --> 10:47.285
All right, guys,
in the Miss Universe pageant,

10:47.319 --> 10:51.456
all of its participants hail
from the same planet, Earth.

10:51.490 --> 10:55.326
So this week, we're going
to broaden that competition.

10:57.863 --> 11:00.531
[laughter]

11:00.566 --> 11:03.000
That's right, your aliens
will be taking part

11:03.035 --> 11:06.404
in our very own
Miss Intergalactic Pageant,

11:06.438 --> 11:07.739
and they will strut their stuff

11:07.773 --> 11:09.307
right here in front
of the judges

11:09.341 --> 11:11.309
with the hopes
of being crowned the winner.

11:11.343 --> 11:12.710
I'm so excited.

11:12.745 --> 11:13.911
It's a pageant.

11:13.946 --> 11:15.813
This is the best challenge.

11:15.848 --> 11:17.749
I just love fun characters.

11:17.783 --> 11:20.151
Now, on each
of these dress forms

11:20.185 --> 11:23.588
is a sash with the name
of a different galaxy

11:23.622 --> 11:26.491
that you will use as inspiration
for your aliens.

11:26.525 --> 11:28.192
When Gabriela calls your name,

11:28.227 --> 11:31.496
I want you to come up
and select a sash.

11:31.530 --> 11:34.465
Okay, he looks very excited,
so, Ben,

11:34.500 --> 11:36.334
you have to pick first.

11:36.368 --> 11:38.236
Miss Andromeda Galaxy.

11:38.270 --> 11:40.738
- Emily.
- Miss Pinwheel Galaxy.

11:40.773 --> 11:42.907
- Logan.
- Miss Comet Galaxy.

11:42.941 --> 11:44.876
- Julian.
- Miss Whirlpool Galaxy.

11:44.910 --> 11:47.378
- Stephanie.
- Miss Tadpole Galaxy.

11:47.412 --> 11:49.947
- Darla.
- Miss Sculptor Galaxy.

11:49.982 --> 11:51.983
- Adam.
- Miss Cigar Galaxy.

11:52.017 --> 11:54.252
Kelly, you're the one
with the hat,

11:54.286 --> 11:55.787
so take your sombrero sash.

11:55.821 --> 11:58.556
Miss Sombrero Galaxy.

12:00.359 --> 12:02.560
(McKenzie) All right, guys,
this week's winning character

12:02.594 --> 12:06.364
will not only be crowned
Miss Intergalactic

12:06.398 --> 12:09.500
but will also be featured
in a full-page spread

12:09.535 --> 12:11.302
in <i> Entertainment Weekly.</i>

12:11.336 --> 12:13.237
- Cool.
- What?

12:13.272 --> 12:16.240
To have a full-page spread
in <i> Entertainment Weekly</i>

12:16.275 --> 12:17.942
would be absolutely awesome.

12:17.976 --> 12:21.279
It really sells the other side
of the makeup industry

12:21.313 --> 12:23.080
other than just making monsters.

12:23.115 --> 12:25.249
Gabriela, thank you so much
for joining us today.

12:25.284 --> 12:27.552
Thank you for having me,
and you guys enjoy.

12:27.586 --> 12:29.587
All right, it's time to start
working on your designs.

12:29.621 --> 12:31.489
Your coaches will join you soon
at the lab

12:31.523 --> 12:32.623
to see how you're faring.

12:32.658 --> 12:33.624
Good luck, guys.

12:33.659 --> 12:34.659
- Bye.
- Bye.

12:41.934 --> 12:45.002
Pageants incorporate hair,
something I love;

12:45.037 --> 12:47.271
Sass, I'm kind of sassy;

12:47.306 --> 12:48.806
And, I mean, come on,

12:48.841 --> 12:51.509
it's an alien beauty pageant.

12:51.543 --> 12:54.545
Pinwheel Galaxy
is full of young stars,

12:54.580 --> 12:56.614
and I conceptualize a character

12:56.648 --> 12:59.417
that has an asymmetrical style
dress,

12:59.451 --> 13:01.252
and I want to incorporate
a big wig

13:01.286 --> 13:04.322
with a pinwheel with rhinestones
and glitter on it.

13:04.356 --> 13:06.157
This challenge, I need to win.

13:06.191 --> 13:07.925
I just want to win it so bad.

13:09.928 --> 13:12.430
The Comet Galaxy
is essentially being torn apart

13:12.464 --> 13:13.965
by a bunch of smaller galaxies,

13:13.999 --> 13:18.002
and my concept is to go from
an organized, beautiful face

13:18.036 --> 13:21.672
to a chaotic, far less beautiful
profile in the back.

13:21.707 --> 13:23.608
This one's definitely
taking me out of my comfort zone

13:23.642 --> 13:25.409
'cause it's a beauty challenge,

13:25.444 --> 13:27.345
but it's an opportunity
to explore some things

13:27.379 --> 13:28.546
that I haven't done before.

13:32.351 --> 13:35.353
My alien
is from the Whirlpool Galaxy.

13:35.387 --> 13:37.555
She's going to have
a very human face,

13:37.589 --> 13:40.424
and I'm thinking of some kind
of elongated head.

13:40.459 --> 13:41.692
I'm gonna go
with a green color scheme

13:41.727 --> 13:44.428
to incorporate the colors
of the actual galaxy.

13:44.463 --> 13:46.530
She's won Miss Whirlpool Galaxy,

13:46.565 --> 13:49.333
so I don't see why she
can't win Miss Intergalactic.

13:51.103 --> 13:52.870
(Stephanie)
I picked the Tadpole Galaxy.

13:52.905 --> 13:54.272
It looks like a tadpole

13:54.306 --> 13:56.841
with hot, yellowy orange
in the center.

13:56.875 --> 14:00.311
So I want my alien to have
a really long tadpole tail.

14:00.345 --> 14:01.679
The face will be the focal point

14:01.713 --> 14:03.814
and then just more muted
in the back.

14:03.849 --> 14:05.049
I'm loving my immunity.

14:05.083 --> 14:06.918
I can do basically
whatever I want,

14:06.952 --> 14:09.020
but I don't want
to just be safe.

14:09.054 --> 14:10.821
I want to have, like,
a top look at least.

14:15.294 --> 14:16.527
(Kelly)
Since the Sombrero Galaxy

14:16.561 --> 14:19.463
is the brightest galaxy
that we can see.

14:19.498 --> 14:20.898
I'm thinking the outside

14:20.933 --> 14:23.668
is just so inhabitable
that she's this beauty

14:23.702 --> 14:25.603
that hides within caves.

14:25.637 --> 14:28.806
I really want to take away
all the human aspect,

14:28.840 --> 14:31.876
so I want to make
huge vacuform eyes.

14:31.910 --> 14:32.977
Very cave-dwelling,

14:33.011 --> 14:35.279
very amphibious kind of a feel.

14:37.215 --> 14:39.083
All right, guys,
let's get back to the lab.

14:51.296 --> 14:53.264
We get back to the lab,
and we pick our models,

14:53.298 --> 14:56.167
and we have 5 1/2 hours
to work today.

14:56.201 --> 14:59.704
The Sculptor Galaxy
is a spiral-shaped galaxy,

14:59.738 --> 15:02.873
so I decide to take
the spiral shape

15:02.908 --> 15:04.642
and kind of put it
on the back of the head

15:04.676 --> 15:09.246
to create sort of an
avant-garde-looking hairstyle.

15:09.281 --> 15:11.716
I'm not entirely sure
if it's gonna work or not,

15:11.750 --> 15:13.551
but I decide
to just quickly block it out

15:13.585 --> 15:14.585
and see how it looks.

15:18.991 --> 15:20.858
- Hey.
- Good morning.

15:20.892 --> 15:22.927
So I have the Cigar Galaxy.

15:22.961 --> 15:25.062
It's pretty much a galaxy
with a lot of stars...

15:25.097 --> 15:26.097
Okay.

15:26.131 --> 15:28.666
So I immediately
attributed that to heat.

15:28.700 --> 15:32.136
My concept for Miss Cigar Galaxy
is that she, over time,

15:32.170 --> 15:34.739
has developed this crest
on her head that gives it

15:34.773 --> 15:37.174
this sort of beautiful form,
but at the same time,

15:37.209 --> 15:40.111
I want that old Hollywood
elegance about her.

15:40.145 --> 15:41.278
I just want to give the judges

15:41.313 --> 15:42.713
something
that they've never seen before.

15:45.117 --> 15:47.618
I think you're on to something
interesting with some of this.

15:47.652 --> 15:50.354
The Andromeda Galaxy is
the largest galaxy in our sky.

15:50.389 --> 15:52.790
I'm kind of playing
with shapes and drawings.

15:52.824 --> 15:55.059
It just has to be
striking and beautiful.

15:55.093 --> 15:58.329
I've really got this cool design
of this three-winged head

15:58.363 --> 16:00.564
with these diamond
three-pointed eyes.

16:00.599 --> 16:02.199
I'm really
stepping outside the box,

16:02.234 --> 16:04.368
but I'm actually
feeling pretty good about this.

16:09.274 --> 16:11.108
So you're putting
multiple eyes on it?

16:11.143 --> 16:12.109
- Yeah.
- Be careful with...

16:12.144 --> 16:13.444
Any time you add
the multiple eyes,

16:13.478 --> 16:14.845
it's always a risk.

16:14.880 --> 16:16.147
I'm looking at the character,

16:16.181 --> 16:19.216
and I realize
adding the extra eyes

16:19.251 --> 16:20.785
could get too arachnid.

16:20.819 --> 16:23.320
This is where I start
to get lost.

16:23.355 --> 16:24.388
You all right?

16:26.725 --> 16:29.126
By now, I'm usually sculpting,

16:29.161 --> 16:33.097
and now I feel like my concept
is not working.

16:34.733 --> 16:35.800
I'm super lost.

16:37.536 --> 16:38.602
What am I gonna do?

16:44.668 --> 16:47.603
It's day one of our
Miss Intergalactic Challenge,

16:47.637 --> 16:50.272
and for the first time,
I feel lost.

16:50.307 --> 16:52.842
I'm really stuck on my
original idea about the eyes.

16:52.876 --> 16:54.443
Think of something
where you cannot rely

16:54.478 --> 16:55.744
too much on the eyes.

16:55.779 --> 16:58.514
Anthony and I decide
to remove the multiple-eye idea,

16:58.548 --> 17:01.984
and now she has tentacles
that wrap up into a hairdo.

17:02.018 --> 17:04.185
It makes so much more sense,

17:04.221 --> 17:07.021
and it's going to be
an awesome character.

17:10.861 --> 17:13.529
I'm using that shape

17:13.563 --> 17:16.765
to create the head
to give it that asymmetry.

17:16.800 --> 17:20.002
Something symmetrical
is universally attractive.

17:20.036 --> 17:21.604
Laura brings up
a really good point,

17:21.637 --> 17:23.672
that when you're trying
to do something beautiful,

17:23.707 --> 17:25.540
asymmetry can really
throw it off.

17:25.575 --> 17:27.742
And if I take the spiral shape

17:27.777 --> 17:29.211
that I had put on the back
of the head

17:29.246 --> 17:31.580
and just move it around
to the side of the head,

17:31.615 --> 17:34.283
I can essentially create
a more symmetrical,

17:34.317 --> 17:35.484
beautiful design.

17:39.990 --> 17:41.390
That's time, everybody.

17:43.226 --> 17:45.060
(Darla) Even though it took
me a little bit more time,

17:45.095 --> 17:48.998
I really like this idea because
it keeps my original concept

17:49.032 --> 17:52.168
but turns it into
a much more beautiful character.

17:59.109 --> 18:01.544
- Go.
- Grr. Grr. Grr.

18:01.578 --> 18:04.580
It's day two in the lab.
We have 9 1/2 hours to work.

18:04.614 --> 18:07.650
I'm excited to get into some
detail on the face and cowl.

18:07.684 --> 18:09.185
I've got to get it done.

18:09.219 --> 18:12.855
The face is essentially going
from organization to chaos,

18:12.889 --> 18:14.290
but it's not looking right.

18:14.324 --> 18:16.392
I want to make it more subtle
in its transition,

18:16.426 --> 18:18.460
so it's speed sculpting time.

18:22.365 --> 18:24.233
- Emily.
- What?

18:24.267 --> 18:25.367
Huuuuh!

18:25.402 --> 18:26.635
(Emily)
Oh! Oh, no.

18:26.670 --> 18:29.838
There's only room for one,
Pinwheel Galaxy.

18:29.873 --> 18:32.074
The battle is on
for Miss Intergalactic.

18:32.108 --> 18:33.475
Step it up, Kelly.

18:33.510 --> 18:35.878
All I get for breakfast...
power squats.

18:35.912 --> 18:37.313
Gosh.

18:37.347 --> 18:40.583
Miss Universe said to have fun
and make a fun character,

18:40.617 --> 18:42.451
so that's what we're doing.

18:42.485 --> 18:46.388
I'm using foam tubing
and swirling it like a pinwheel,

18:46.423 --> 18:50.359
and then I'm going to paint it
like a galaxy, add some glitter,

18:50.393 --> 18:52.228
and make it fabulous.

18:54.064 --> 18:55.731
(Stephanie)
I'm working on the cowl

18:55.765 --> 18:58.367
and taking a lot of inspiration
from the tail end of the galaxy,

18:58.401 --> 19:01.570
making sure the shapes
of the face flow into the cowl.

19:01.605 --> 19:03.772
It looks like
the tail's attached.

19:03.807 --> 19:05.207
(Stephanie)
Laura's giving me advice

19:05.242 --> 19:07.843
on how to keep the flow
for the tail.

19:07.877 --> 19:10.212
Gouge all of this out
and then round it.

19:10.247 --> 19:11.213
It's looking good.

19:11.248 --> 19:12.314
Yeah.

19:15.752 --> 19:18.087
I think this is gonna be
a four-piece mold, man.

19:18.121 --> 19:20.356
Usually the cowls
are a two-piece mold.

19:20.390 --> 19:22.524
There's a front
and a back that come together.

19:22.559 --> 19:24.693
I'm going for a four-piece mold.

19:24.728 --> 19:28.797
I don't want to have to seam
across these soft blended edges,

19:28.832 --> 19:31.233
and so having two core pieces

19:31.268 --> 19:34.236
that are gonna pop out
in between these three forms

19:34.271 --> 19:36.472
will really give me
a nice, sleek prosthetic

19:36.506 --> 19:38.607
when it's all done.

19:38.642 --> 19:40.042
Hey, one hour.

19:41.611 --> 19:43.312
(Kelly) At the end of the
day, I'm picking out

19:43.346 --> 19:46.215
some Kryolan beauty products
for tomorrow.

19:46.249 --> 19:48.884
I know a lot
of these really nice pigments

19:48.918 --> 19:51.487
will add that pearlescent sheen
that's gonna

19:51.521 --> 19:54.556
make Miss Sombrero Galaxy pop
and look beautiful.

19:54.591 --> 19:56.058
Oh, so many pretty colors.

20:01.164 --> 20:02.631
That's time, everybody.

20:02.666 --> 20:04.033
All right.

20:04.067 --> 20:05.901
(Anthony) Leaving day two,
I'm a little worried.

20:05.935 --> 20:07.870
I only have Kelly and Ben
remaining,

20:07.904 --> 20:09.805
and I think Kelly's
might not be enough.

20:09.839 --> 20:11.540
I think Ben's
could fit the challenge,

20:11.574 --> 20:13.676
but it could be
a little too out there.

20:13.710 --> 20:15.377
There's quite a few
more challenges

20:15.412 --> 20:18.914
to get to that finale, so I'm
hoping that I get both there.

20:24.521 --> 20:26.188
- Go.
- Good luck, guys.

20:26.222 --> 20:27.589
(Ben)
It's application day.

20:27.624 --> 20:29.091
I got four hours in the lab,

20:29.125 --> 20:30.326
one hour at Last Looks.

20:30.360 --> 20:31.760
Four-piece mold?

20:31.795 --> 20:32.995
- Yeah.
- Holy shit.

20:33.029 --> 20:34.830
Yeah, talk about a pain
in the ass.

20:34.864 --> 20:37.132
My face has got beautiful
blend edges,

20:37.167 --> 20:38.801
and I've got a couple seam edges

20:38.835 --> 20:40.369
that I need to work
on this cowl,

20:40.403 --> 20:42.037
but I'm feeling really good
about it.

20:42.072 --> 20:43.272
You're crazy.

20:43.306 --> 20:45.007
How did it come out?

20:45.041 --> 20:46.709
You might have
to put a blender on it.

20:46.743 --> 20:48.410
Oh, what?

20:48.445 --> 20:52.548
There's a huge indentation
on one side of my cowl.

20:52.582 --> 20:53.682
This is a beauty pageant.

20:53.717 --> 20:55.050
It needs to be symmetrical.

20:55.085 --> 20:57.753
It's just
the crappiest situation

20:57.787 --> 20:58.787
you can be in right now.

20:58.822 --> 21:00.222
I'm gonna try the foam patch,
I think.

21:00.256 --> 21:01.290
Mm-hmm.

21:01.324 --> 21:04.259
It'll at least
fill it in somewhat.

21:04.294 --> 21:07.096
Foam patch is when you mix
foam latex

21:07.130 --> 21:10.165
and you apply it
to wherever you have problems,

21:10.200 --> 21:12.768
and then you cure the foam
with a heat gun.

21:12.802 --> 21:15.838
The foam patch gets rid
of the crater and makes it seem

21:15.872 --> 21:17.873
like that's what I meant to do
the whole time.

21:20.110 --> 21:21.076
- Logan.
- Alyssa.

21:21.111 --> 21:22.077
Good to meet you.

21:22.112 --> 21:23.078
How are you?

21:23.113 --> 21:24.480
I'm good.
How are you?

21:24.514 --> 21:26.648
You're not gonna have a ton
of stuff on your face.

21:26.683 --> 21:28.183
- That's crazy.
- Pretty nice, huh?

21:28.218 --> 21:29.184
Great to hear.

21:29.219 --> 21:30.552
(Adam)
I'm a little worried

21:30.587 --> 21:32.154
because even though
I don't have a face to apply,

21:32.188 --> 21:35.691
I have to apply the cowl,
two arm pieces,

21:35.725 --> 21:37.426
two chest pieces,

21:37.460 --> 21:39.561
and 12 individual scales
on her face,

21:39.596 --> 21:40.863
so I have a lot to do.

21:46.569 --> 21:48.303
(Darla)
As I'm gluing the face down,

21:48.338 --> 21:51.306
I notice a crease
going from the nose

21:51.341 --> 21:52.674
all the way down the lip.

21:52.709 --> 21:53.942
The whole point
of this challenge

21:53.977 --> 21:55.844
is to create something
very beautiful,

21:55.879 --> 21:57.880
so I'm gonna have to be
really careful to make sure

21:57.914 --> 22:02.317
that I don't end up with
any other undesired creases.

22:02.352 --> 22:04.686
(Emily) I'm using Kryolan
Aquacolor Dayglow

22:04.721 --> 22:06.688
as well as pink,
purple, and turquoise

22:06.723 --> 22:09.091
to create an artificial skin.

22:09.125 --> 22:10.893
So let me glitter you.

22:10.927 --> 22:12.728
And then I give glitter.

22:12.762 --> 22:13.929
[laughing]

22:13.963 --> 22:15.697
Ah, it's just so much glitter.

22:15.732 --> 22:19.435
My model loves glitter,
so it's gonna be a perfect day.

22:19.469 --> 22:21.870
This is making my heart happy.

22:21.905 --> 22:23.105
One hour, everyone.

22:23.139 --> 22:25.474
Great, I'm pretty behind.

22:25.508 --> 22:27.743
We only have, like,
an hour left in lab,

22:27.777 --> 22:30.112
and I need to get in to paint.

22:30.146 --> 22:32.381
These tentacles take
so much detail,

22:32.415 --> 22:33.749
and they have to pop.

22:33.783 --> 22:35.417
This is what's gonna
make or break me.

22:37.253 --> 22:38.620
So definitely,
when you airbrush,

22:38.655 --> 22:40.389
have to accentuate
her cheekbones.

22:40.423 --> 22:43.892
I've never done beauty makeup,
so Laura gives me some advice

22:43.927 --> 22:45.994
on where the eye shadow
should end,

22:46.029 --> 22:47.796
the lipstick color.

22:47.831 --> 22:49.164
You wouldn't think
that the hot light

22:49.199 --> 22:51.200
is gonna make much
of a difference, but it does.

22:51.234 --> 22:53.202
It's stuff that I'm not
very familiar with.

22:53.236 --> 22:54.603
15 minutes, everybody.

22:58.908 --> 23:01.143
(Julian) Because this is a beauty
pageant, I need to get good

23:01.177 --> 23:03.545
at doing beauty makeup
as fast as possible...

23:03.580 --> 23:05.013
That's time, everybody.

23:05.048 --> 23:07.883
Or this challenge can be
the one that sends me home.

23:16.004 --> 23:17.437
Let me see how I like this.

23:17.472 --> 23:19.606
I have an hour left
for Last Looks.

23:19.641 --> 23:21.808
I still have to paint her body

23:21.843 --> 23:24.711
and figure out how I'm going
to blend in these tentacles.

23:24.746 --> 23:27.314
This is going to take up
a lot of time.

23:27.348 --> 23:29.182
Let me know
if I'm being too rough, okay?

23:29.217 --> 23:30.684
I still have a ton of work
to do,

23:30.718 --> 23:33.420
but I need to just focus
on doing the beauty makeup

23:33.454 --> 23:35.088
as best as I can.

23:35.123 --> 23:36.456
(Ben)
Got to get these eyes on you.

23:36.491 --> 23:37.891
I'm scrambling.

23:37.925 --> 23:40.360
This is an important piece,
so I need to focus on the eyes

23:40.395 --> 23:42.596
and shy away
from the beauty makeup.

23:42.630 --> 23:44.297
That's cool.

23:44.332 --> 23:46.967
I have to attach the spikes
on the back of the cowl.

23:47.001 --> 23:49.102
I'm trying to figure out
how to set this hot give

23:49.137 --> 23:50.504
and not wait for it to hold.

23:50.538 --> 23:53.340
So I shoot the cold air
from the airbrush,

23:53.374 --> 23:55.609
and the spikes are setting up,
and I'm like, "Oh, my God,

23:55.643 --> 23:57.744
I just MacGyver'd this,
and it's working."

23:57.779 --> 23:58.812
Ten minutes, everyone.

24:07.755 --> 24:08.955
That's time, everyone.

24:08.990 --> 24:09.990
Whew.

24:11.592 --> 24:15.228
I don't feel like this
is anything like I wanted.

24:15.263 --> 24:16.763
That ended up being a hot mess.

24:16.798 --> 24:18.532
I just want to be safe.

24:28.976 --> 24:31.144
Welcome to the <i> Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

24:31.179 --> 24:32.746
Now, as you know,

24:32.780 --> 24:35.449
one of you
will be going home tonight.

24:35.483 --> 24:36.950
But before we see
your creations,

24:36.984 --> 24:39.953
let's say hello
to our series judges.

24:39.987 --> 24:42.956
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio, Glenn Hetrick.

24:42.990 --> 24:44.891
- Good evening, guys.
- Good evening.

24:44.926 --> 24:47.427
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

24:47.462 --> 24:49.196
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Ve.

24:49.230 --> 24:51.398
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page.

24:51.432 --> 24:52.866
- Hello, everyone.
- Hi, Neville.

24:52.900 --> 24:55.302
And joining us tonight
to help choose the winner

24:55.336 --> 24:58.004
of the full-page spread
in <i> Entertainment Weekly</i>

24:58.039 --> 25:00.474
is senior writer
for <i> Entertainment Weekly</i>

25:00.508 --> 25:02.242
Darren Franich.

25:02.276 --> 25:04.144
[applause]

25:04.178 --> 25:05.545
(Adam) Darren Franich
has got his hand

25:05.580 --> 25:07.981
on the pulse of Hollywood,
so even if I don't win,

25:08.015 --> 25:09.750
I hope he's at least
impressed by the makeup.

25:09.784 --> 25:11.918
Darren, thank you so much
for joining us tonight.

25:11.953 --> 25:13.386
Thank you very much
for having me.

25:13.421 --> 25:15.355
So did you ever think you'd be
judging a beauty pageant?

25:15.389 --> 25:16.923
It was one of my biggest dreams,
actually,

25:16.958 --> 25:18.692
so I'm glad
it's finally coming true

25:18.726 --> 25:20.260
in an appropriately strange way.

25:20.294 --> 25:23.296
Well, I guarantee you
this is gonna be a lot of fun.

25:23.331 --> 25:26.399
All right, guys, this week,
your Spotlight Challenge

25:26.434 --> 25:29.936
was to choose a galaxy
and create an alien beauty queen

25:29.971 --> 25:34.775
to participate in our very own
Miss Intergalactic Pageant.

25:34.809 --> 25:37.477
So let's take a look
at your creations.

25:40.681 --> 25:43.416
Fresh from sector EW-1,

25:43.451 --> 25:46.887
Miss Pinwheel Galaxy
enjoys space, beekeeping,

25:46.921 --> 25:50.957
and is saving up to buy her own
passel of space possums.

25:50.992 --> 25:52.793
She's also a strict vegetarian

25:52.827 --> 25:55.195
and hopes to someday end
animal cruelty

25:55.229 --> 25:56.997
throughout her galaxy.

25:57.031 --> 26:00.500
Say hello
to Miss Pinwheel Galaxy.

26:06.541 --> 26:08.875
(Emily) It's really nice to
see the overall character.

26:08.910 --> 26:12.012
I'm so happy.
It looks so cool.

26:12.046 --> 26:16.316
(McKenzie) Miss Tadpole Galaxy
is from the planet M-13,

26:16.350 --> 26:19.853
where her hobbies include
shopping, stardust surfing,

26:19.887 --> 26:21.087
and dancing.

26:21.122 --> 26:23.423
With a major
in celestial sciences,

26:23.457 --> 26:25.792
she dreams of one day
leading a research team

26:25.827 --> 26:28.461
to discover the far end
of the universe.

26:28.496 --> 26:31.498
Say hello
to Miss Tadpole Galaxy.

26:37.705 --> 26:39.172
(Stephanie)
I'm really happy with her.

26:39.207 --> 26:41.441
She's just all kinds
of fun and happy

26:41.475 --> 26:43.844
and really killing it
and looking like a beauty queen.

26:46.881 --> 26:48.715
(McKenzie)
Miss Andromeda Galaxy

26:48.749 --> 26:52.352
loves long walks around Neptune
and eating at the Milky Way.

26:52.386 --> 26:54.154
She hopes to one day meet a guy

26:54.188 --> 26:56.990
who will give her a ring
as big as Saturn's.

26:57.024 --> 27:00.427
Say hello
to Miss Andromeda Galaxy.

27:06.267 --> 27:08.768
(Ben) I'm not sure if I went
in the right direction.

27:08.803 --> 27:10.270
I really thought
outside the box.

27:10.304 --> 27:12.439
I'm just hoping that the judges
are with me on this one.

27:14.642 --> 27:16.910
(McKenzie) All right, we
have Miss Cigar Galaxy.

27:16.944 --> 27:20.614
She hopes to one day command
her own interstellar army

27:20.648 --> 27:23.617
and achieve
intergalactic domination.

27:23.651 --> 27:27.053
Her hobbies include devouring
her mates after fertilization

27:27.088 --> 27:28.188
and knitting.

27:28.222 --> 27:31.324
Please say hello
to Miss Cigar Galaxy.

27:37.298 --> 27:39.065
(Adam)
I know I have a strong concept,

27:39.100 --> 27:42.402
but I'm worried that I may not
do as well as I'd hope to do.

27:45.039 --> 27:48.508
(McKenzie) Miss Comet Galaxy
enjoys interstellar travel

27:48.542 --> 27:52.245
and spends her time paragliding
through solar flares.

27:52.280 --> 27:54.180
She dreams of clothing the needy

27:54.215 --> 27:57.150
and increasing literacy
throughout her galaxy.

27:57.184 --> 28:00.587
Please say hello
to Miss Comet Galaxy.

28:06.661 --> 28:07.961
(Logan)
I think she looks fantastic.

28:07.995 --> 28:09.396
The only thing
that I am concerned about

28:09.430 --> 28:13.400
is that the overall shape
of the face is a little bit off.

28:15.670 --> 28:17.537
(McKenzie)
Miss Whirlpool Galaxy.

28:17.571 --> 28:20.040
She enjoys surfing
through black holes,

28:20.074 --> 28:22.709
Earth gazing,
and dancing in the moonlight.

28:22.743 --> 28:25.445
She hopes to find
Mr. Affirmative one day

28:25.479 --> 28:27.280
and start a colony together.

28:27.315 --> 28:30.350
Say hello
to Miss Whirlpool Galaxy.

28:36.490 --> 28:38.058
(Julian)
She definitely has this, like,

28:38.092 --> 28:40.026
Marilyn Monroe alien vibe
going on,

28:40.061 --> 28:42.929
so I think I might have
a good chance.

28:42.964 --> 28:45.999
(McKenzie) All right, now
Miss Sombrero Galaxy.

28:46.033 --> 28:47.834
She loves small animals

28:47.868 --> 28:51.771
and hopes to one day
devour one of every species.

28:51.806 --> 28:55.041
Her hobbies include diving
for gems, ex-husbands,

28:55.076 --> 28:57.077
and giving herself neck rubs.

28:57.111 --> 29:00.313
Please lay hello
to Miss Sombrero Galaxy.

29:06.320 --> 29:08.254
(Kelly) I didn't get to
finish the paint job,

29:08.289 --> 29:10.991
but I think she looks beautiful.

29:12.927 --> 29:16.629
(McKenzie) Miss Sculptor Galaxy
grew up near a black hole.

29:16.664 --> 29:18.999
Raised in darkness,
she hopes to bring light

29:19.033 --> 29:21.067
and good fortune
to the universe.

29:21.102 --> 29:24.804
She loves to travel and enjoys
collecting coins and currency

29:24.839 --> 29:26.740
everywhere she goes.

29:26.774 --> 29:30.510
Please say hello
to Miss Sculptor Galaxy.

29:36.751 --> 29:37.951
(Darla)
I'm really proud of it.

29:37.985 --> 29:39.185
She's so elegant.

29:39.220 --> 29:41.021
I really hope that the judges
like it as well.

29:45.960 --> 29:48.628
Judges, why don't you take
a closer look at our beauties?

29:53.200 --> 29:55.168
Whatever's happening
with the mouth

29:55.202 --> 29:58.438
takes her from being beautiful
to injured.

29:58.472 --> 30:00.140
It's the one character
that really seems to kind of

30:00.174 --> 30:02.375
tell a story beyond just,
"This is what I look like."

30:02.410 --> 30:03.410
(Ve)
Yeah.

30:06.547 --> 30:09.249
She looks like a microwaved
marshmallow Peep.

30:09.283 --> 30:10.683
(Ve) I think, with a
better paint job,

30:10.718 --> 30:12.786
this could have been
a lot more interesting makeup.

30:12.820 --> 30:14.220
(Darren)
The nose and the back,

30:14.255 --> 30:16.823
they sort of seem to come from
two very different design ideas.

30:16.857 --> 30:19.526
(Glenn)
I agree.

30:19.560 --> 30:20.693
(Neville)
Holy moly.

30:20.728 --> 30:22.228
(Glenn) The combination
of color and form,

30:22.263 --> 30:24.130
it's so stuck on.

30:24.165 --> 30:25.465
Up close, it feels sort of
less thought out.

30:25.499 --> 30:26.566
(Ben)
I'm looking at the judges.

30:26.600 --> 30:28.301
Not sure
how they're feeling about it,

30:28.335 --> 30:30.904
and I'm worried my concept
and design might send me home.

30:33.641 --> 30:36.643
Tell us who made your favorite
alien beauty queen tonight

30:36.677 --> 30:39.345
on Twitter using #FaceOff

30:41.719 --> 30:42.986
It feels sort of
less thought out

30:43.020 --> 30:44.521
the closer up you get.

30:44.555 --> 30:46.623
(Ben) I don't think the judges
like my makeup very much,

30:46.657 --> 30:48.758
but hopefully
they won't send me home.

30:48.793 --> 30:50.593
When you look at the chin,

30:50.628 --> 30:53.363
that is some really nice,
simple form,

30:53.397 --> 30:55.165
and then it gets excessive.

30:57.301 --> 30:58.268
Wow.

30:58.302 --> 31:00.203
The head is awesome.

31:00.237 --> 31:02.205
- It feels very original.
- Oh, yeah.

31:05.242 --> 31:06.709
(Ve)
It's really quite pretty.

31:06.744 --> 31:08.878
(Glenn) I think it's a beautiful
combination of shapes

31:08.913 --> 31:10.213
that we've never seen before.

31:10.247 --> 31:11.448
It's very brave and original.

31:14.418 --> 31:17.253
(Neville) This little piece
right here enhances her lips,

31:17.288 --> 31:18.922
and it does retain
the prettiness.

31:18.956 --> 31:20.190
(Darren) The elegance,
more than anything,

31:20.224 --> 31:21.257
is what struck me with this.

31:21.292 --> 31:22.592
I think because it's so simple,

31:22.626 --> 31:23.893
it was actually quite effective.

31:23.928 --> 31:26.162
(Glenn)
Yeah.

31:26.197 --> 31:28.698
(Ve)
This is very busy.

31:28.732 --> 31:30.467
Just a little, head to toe.

31:30.501 --> 31:34.037
It befuddles me that she
didn't put a beauty makeup on her.

31:34.071 --> 31:35.572
(Darren) I'm just not
sure it goes together.

31:35.606 --> 31:37.107
The ear tentacles,

31:37.141 --> 31:39.843
they don't necessarily seem to
apply to the rest of the design.

31:41.779 --> 31:42.745
(Neville)
This is stunning.

31:42.780 --> 31:44.447
Look at all the detail in this.

31:44.482 --> 31:45.615
This is really gorgeous.

31:45.649 --> 31:48.251
The beauty makeup
widens her face

31:48.285 --> 31:49.719
and makes it that much prettier.

31:49.753 --> 31:50.753
(Glenn)
Thank you.

31:57.394 --> 31:59.629
All right, the judges
have scored your creations,

31:59.663 --> 32:01.231
so let's find out
what they thought.

32:01.265 --> 32:03.366
Logan.

32:03.400 --> 32:05.201
Emily.

32:05.236 --> 32:07.837
Stephanie.

32:07.872 --> 32:09.372
You guys are safe this week

32:09.406 --> 32:11.641
and can head back
to the makeup room.

32:11.675 --> 32:12.675
Thank you.

32:17.081 --> 32:20.884
The rest of you are the best
and the worst this week.

32:20.918 --> 32:22.552
The judges would like
to speak with each of you

32:22.586 --> 32:24.053
to find out
more about your work.

32:24.088 --> 32:26.289
Adam, if you'd please step up.

32:31.428 --> 32:33.997
Tell us about how your galaxy
inspired your makeup.

32:34.031 --> 32:36.533
One tidbit about
the Cigar Galaxy is,

32:36.567 --> 32:37.734
there's more suns,

32:37.768 --> 32:39.469
hotter planets,
rougher environment,

32:39.503 --> 32:42.005
so I decided to go for something
very rough and coarse

32:42.039 --> 32:43.840
and make that beautiful.

32:43.874 --> 32:45.008
I really want to applaud you

32:45.042 --> 32:48.178
for how brave you were
with your design.

32:48.212 --> 32:49.445
It's amazing.

32:49.480 --> 32:51.047
I've never seen the shape
before.

32:51.081 --> 32:52.248
Thank you.

32:52.283 --> 32:54.951
Can you turn sideways for us
for a moment?

32:54.985 --> 32:57.554
That's just an amazing,
bizarre shape

32:57.588 --> 32:59.722
that is so elegant
from the side.

32:59.757 --> 33:01.691
- Nice work, honey.
- Thank you.

33:01.725 --> 33:06.696
What I'd love to have seen
is the power of that side view

33:06.730 --> 33:09.532
brought into the front view
as well.

33:09.567 --> 33:11.467
I love the way that the skin
sort of gives way

33:11.502 --> 33:14.037
to something that looks
very lavalike and rocklike.

33:14.071 --> 33:16.272
The overall look of this
was so compelling for me.

33:16.307 --> 33:17.340
Thank you.

33:18.742 --> 33:19.742
Please step back.

33:25.883 --> 33:28.251
Kelly, you're up next.

33:32.957 --> 33:34.157
(Ve)
Would you please tell us

33:34.191 --> 33:37.560
how your galaxy inspired
your alien beauty queen?

33:37.595 --> 33:39.862
My galaxy
was the Sombrero Galaxy,

33:39.897 --> 33:42.165
and it has very bright stars,

33:42.199 --> 33:44.334
so the only way
that she can live

33:44.368 --> 33:47.270
is to hide in caves
and live in the waters

33:47.304 --> 33:48.404
because the outside

33:48.439 --> 33:51.107
is just so uninhabitable
from the radiation.

33:51.141 --> 33:53.543
So she's more
of an aquatic-type character?

33:53.577 --> 33:54.978
Mm-hmm.

33:55.012 --> 33:57.814
I have to tell you, I think all
of this is just way too busy.

33:59.883 --> 34:02.185
You don't have any place
for your eye to focus,

34:02.219 --> 34:05.822
so for me, this is not
a really great makeup this week.

34:05.856 --> 34:08.024
What you sculpted, I do like,

34:08.058 --> 34:09.859
but the application of it

34:09.893 --> 34:12.895
makes it look
like a pullover mask.

34:12.929 --> 34:16.366
The sort of mixture of
the fishlike crown on the front

34:16.400 --> 34:17.833
and then the tentacles in back

34:17.868 --> 34:21.670
feel like there's a few too many
things happening here.

34:21.705 --> 34:23.672
Kelly,
if you'd please step down.

34:29.947 --> 34:31.380
Julian, please come forward.

34:37.688 --> 34:40.757
Tell us about your concept
and how your galaxy choice

34:40.791 --> 34:42.091
may have influenced the design.

34:42.126 --> 34:44.027
Well, I had
the Whirlpool Galaxy,

34:44.061 --> 34:45.661
and it's a very new galaxy,

34:45.696 --> 34:47.563
so I wanted to give her
a sleek, elegant look

34:47.598 --> 34:50.233
while incorporating some of
the colors of the galaxy itself.

34:50.266 --> 34:53.369
There's a beautiful thing
happening around the face

34:53.404 --> 34:55.772
with shape.

34:55.806 --> 34:58.441
It's simple
and extraordinarily successful.

34:58.475 --> 34:59.609
Thank you.

34:59.643 --> 35:01.244
I think the forms are stellar.

35:01.278 --> 35:05.548
You very nicely balanced
the alien beauty part

35:05.582 --> 35:07.583
of this concept.

35:07.618 --> 35:09.018
She's absolutely gorgeous.

35:09.053 --> 35:11.621
You did a beautiful job
of shading her cheekbones,

35:11.655 --> 35:13.389
and the treatment
of the eye makeup

35:13.424 --> 35:14.757
is done really, really well.

35:14.792 --> 35:16.059
Thank you.

35:16.093 --> 35:17.527
Julian, please step back.

35:17.561 --> 35:19.095
Thanks.

35:23.834 --> 35:25.568
Darla, please step
to the center.

35:32.843 --> 35:34.410
Can you tell us a bit
about your character

35:34.445 --> 35:36.779
and how your galaxy
inspired the design?

35:36.814 --> 35:38.681
I had the Sculptor Galaxy.

35:38.716 --> 35:42.085
The main inspiration I took was
the spiral pattern for the head,

35:42.119 --> 35:44.921
and it's also known
as the Silver Dollar Galaxy,

35:44.955 --> 35:47.423
so I put silver contacts
in her eyes.

35:47.458 --> 35:50.660
There's this real element
of glamour to it.

35:50.694 --> 35:52.962
There's almost an alien
old Hollywood quality,

35:52.996 --> 35:55.164
like space Norma Desmond
or something like that,

35:55.199 --> 35:57.300
and I really just think
it's very well done.

35:57.334 --> 35:59.102
Thank you so much.

35:59.136 --> 36:01.771
The forms are just stunning.

36:01.805 --> 36:04.540
That is what I want to see
from everybody every week.

36:04.575 --> 36:06.175
I'm really impressed.

36:06.210 --> 36:07.477
Thank you.

36:07.511 --> 36:08.811
She's classy.

36:08.846 --> 36:09.879
She's elegant.

36:09.913 --> 36:11.147
She's beautiful.

36:11.181 --> 36:12.148
We hate it.

36:12.182 --> 36:13.549
[laughter]

36:13.584 --> 36:16.386
- Didn't like it very much.
- You're in trouble.

36:16.420 --> 36:19.355
Darla, please step back.

36:19.390 --> 36:20.890
(Darla)
Thank you so much.

36:25.929 --> 36:27.063
Thanks.

36:27.097 --> 36:28.231
Ben, you're up.

36:36.273 --> 36:38.908
Ben, tell us
how the Andromeda Galaxy

36:38.942 --> 36:40.743
informed your decisions
this week.

36:40.778 --> 36:42.011
I pretty much took it

36:42.045 --> 36:44.580
as the opportunity
to make whatever I wanted to,

36:44.615 --> 36:46.749
and then I started thinking
about these eyes.

36:46.784 --> 36:49.452
As an eye piece,
I haven't seen it done before,

36:49.486 --> 36:51.854
and just wanted to play around
with makeup today.

36:51.889 --> 36:54.056
You went a different route
than everybody else,

36:54.091 --> 36:55.258
and I applaud that,

36:55.292 --> 36:58.194
but for some reason,
it didn't come together.

37:00.364 --> 37:03.666
The texture of the plane
directly around this device

37:03.700 --> 37:05.435
begs to be broken up with color,

37:05.469 --> 37:07.870
whether that's speckling
or veining or something.

37:07.905 --> 37:09.839
I think texture and color

37:09.873 --> 37:13.810
could have pulled together
what is a really solid idea.

37:13.844 --> 37:15.978
There's some really beautiful
form work,

37:16.013 --> 37:18.181
and then we get
to this eye thing,

37:18.215 --> 37:23.085
which feels like a '60s Japanese
superhero-type character,

37:23.120 --> 37:25.855
and that is not this challenge.

37:25.889 --> 37:28.124
I love the basic
abstract design of this,

37:28.158 --> 37:29.692
but there's something missing,

37:29.726 --> 37:32.462
and it doesn't quite hit me
the way I think it should.

37:32.496 --> 37:33.963
Ben, please step back.

37:33.997 --> 37:35.932
Thanks.

37:38.902 --> 37:40.136
(McKenzie)
Thank you guys.

37:40.170 --> 37:41.571
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

37:41.605 --> 37:42.905
while the judges deliberate.

37:49.713 --> 37:51.047
All right, judges,
so let's start

37:51.081 --> 37:52.815
with your favorites this week.

37:52.850 --> 37:54.217
How about Adam?

37:54.251 --> 37:56.719
(Neville) An amazing makeup,
an amazing creature.

37:56.753 --> 37:58.988
(Darren) I loved the
biogeological elements of it.

37:59.022 --> 38:01.457
I loved the way that the lava
melded in with the skin.

38:01.492 --> 38:02.758
(Ve)
I really loved the profile.

38:02.793 --> 38:05.461
We've really never seen
anything like that before.

38:05.496 --> 38:07.296
All right,
let's move on to Julian.

38:07.331 --> 38:08.898
(Neville)
One of the things he did best

38:08.932 --> 38:11.200
was utilize
the actual model's beauty.

38:11.235 --> 38:13.903
(Darren) The simplicity, I think,
is what we all responded to.

38:13.937 --> 38:16.472
Not a lot of other people
really achieved that this week.

38:16.507 --> 38:18.975
Okay, judges,
let's move on to Darla.

38:19.009 --> 38:20.710
(Ve)
It's clean. It's elegant.

38:20.744 --> 38:21.711
It's classy.

38:21.745 --> 38:23.646
It's just a stunning makeup.

38:23.680 --> 38:25.047
(Glenn)
The forms are beautiful.

38:25.082 --> 38:28.584
You could put that character
as a lead alien in a film.

38:28.619 --> 38:31.053
All right, let's move on
to your least favorite makeups.

38:31.088 --> 38:32.822
Why don't we start with Kelly?

38:32.856 --> 38:35.858
(Ve) She mixed up so many different
colors, purples and pinks.

38:35.893 --> 38:38.394
It looked like it had purple
slugs coming out of its ears.

38:38.428 --> 38:41.964
(Glenn) The edges, where they
even were sculpted, don't work.

38:41.999 --> 38:44.000
(Neville)
The execution of it is bad,

38:44.034 --> 38:47.503
but I still see the potential
in this design.

38:47.538 --> 38:49.805
Let's move on to Ben.

38:49.840 --> 38:51.641
(Glenn)
There are so many good ideas,

38:51.675 --> 38:53.509
but it's not beautiful.

38:53.544 --> 38:54.877
(Darren) There are so many
things that didn't work there,

38:54.912 --> 38:56.479
but it's interesting
that his whole aesthetic

38:56.513 --> 38:57.513
is very much built around,

38:57.548 --> 38:58.848
"I'm gonna take a wild gamble,"

38:58.882 --> 39:00.116
and sometimes it works,

39:00.150 --> 39:01.651
and this time, it really didn't.

39:01.685 --> 39:03.719
Okay, judges,
have you made your decisions?

39:03.754 --> 39:04.921
- Yeah, we have.
- We have. - Yes.

39:04.955 --> 39:06.188
Okay, let's bring them back out.

39:14.665 --> 39:17.767
(McKenzie) All right, Glenn,
tell us about the semifinalists.

39:17.801 --> 39:21.504
Adam, your character
is striking from afar,

39:21.538 --> 39:24.340
and it managed to create
a wow factor profile

39:24.374 --> 39:27.443
with that cowl
that we have never seen before.

39:27.477 --> 39:29.812
Julian, you did an excellent job

39:29.846 --> 39:32.181
embracing your model's beauty
and enhancing it.

39:32.215 --> 39:35.318
Though she was clearly alien,
she was still a stunning beauty.

39:35.352 --> 39:36.752
Darla,

39:36.787 --> 39:39.155
we loved the inherent glamour
of your character.

39:39.189 --> 39:40.456
She has a sexy,

39:40.490 --> 39:43.225
almost regal feeling
that made her a real standout.

39:43.260 --> 39:44.226
Thank you.

39:44.261 --> 39:45.928
All right, big moment.

39:45.963 --> 39:49.732
Who is the winner of
our Miss Intergalactic Pageant?

39:49.766 --> 39:53.035
The winner of our
Miss Intergalactic Pageant is...

40:01.243 --> 40:05.112
All right, who is the winner of
our Miss Intergalactic Pageant?

40:05.146 --> 40:08.148
The winner of our
Miss Intergalactic Pageant is...

40:11.887 --> 40:15.222
Miss Sculptor Galaxy.

40:15.257 --> 40:18.158
[applause]

40:18.193 --> 40:19.660
She is not only beautiful,

40:19.694 --> 40:22.897
but the makeup is applied
and painted flawlessly.

40:22.931 --> 40:25.366
We are so glad to see you
back on top this week.

40:25.400 --> 40:26.800
Thank you so much.

40:26.835 --> 40:29.470
I can't believe
that I just won this challenge.

40:29.504 --> 40:32.139
It's exciting to be a top look,

40:32.173 --> 40:34.308
but to actually win
a Spotlight Challenge

40:34.342 --> 40:36.343
is such a great feeling.

40:36.378 --> 40:39.046
Darla, congratulations,
and, of course,

40:39.080 --> 40:43.317
congratulations to our
very first Miss Intergalactic.

40:43.351 --> 40:45.986
The two of you will be featured
in a full-page spread

40:46.021 --> 40:47.554
in <i> Entertainment Weekly.</i>

40:47.589 --> 40:49.390
- That's amazing.
- Congratulations on that.

40:49.424 --> 40:50.591
Thank you.

40:50.625 --> 40:51.692
[applause]

40:51.726 --> 40:54.028
(McKenzie)
Darla, you, Adam, and Julian

40:54.062 --> 40:55.496
can head back to the makeup room

40:55.530 --> 40:57.364
with the coaches
and our beauties.

41:05.640 --> 41:07.007
All right, that means
the two of you

41:07.042 --> 41:08.208
are on the bottom this week,

41:08.243 --> 41:10.344
and one of you
will be going home.

41:10.378 --> 41:11.512
Please step forward.

41:19.554 --> 41:21.855
Glenn, tell us
about tonight's bottom looks.

41:21.890 --> 41:24.825
Kelly, some of your sculpting
was interesting,

41:24.859 --> 41:26.827
but the poor application
of your pieces

41:26.861 --> 41:28.729
and rough nature
of your paint work

41:28.763 --> 41:30.464
were underwhelming.

41:30.498 --> 41:33.600
Ben, we appreciate that you
swung for the fences again,

41:33.635 --> 41:36.036
but there were a number
of things, design-wise,

41:36.071 --> 41:38.505
that detracted from her beauty.

41:38.540 --> 41:40.174
So who is going home tonight?

41:40.208 --> 41:41.976
The person
going home tonight is...

41:46.247 --> 41:49.483
Kelly.

41:49.517 --> 41:51.952
We know that you had some
good ideas going on this week,

41:51.987 --> 41:54.521
but it seems that you really
struggled to bring them

41:54.556 --> 41:57.424
all together
into a cohesive, clean makeup.

41:57.459 --> 41:59.994
I had a bit
of a struggle this week,

42:00.028 --> 42:01.395
and it showed.

42:01.429 --> 42:04.798
Kelly, I'm so sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

42:04.833 --> 42:06.066
Ben, you are safe this week

42:06.101 --> 42:07.534
and can head back
to the makeup room.

42:12.107 --> 42:15.342
Kelly, you have done some
inspired and fun makeups for us,

42:15.377 --> 42:16.577
and I really look forward

42:16.611 --> 42:18.679
to what the future
has in store for you.

42:18.713 --> 42:20.014
Thank you.

42:20.048 --> 42:22.349
Kelly, it's been great
having you here with us,

42:22.384 --> 42:24.351
but if you'd please
head back to the makeup room

42:24.386 --> 42:25.352
and pack up your kit.

42:25.387 --> 42:26.453
Thanks, guys.

42:26.454 --> 42:27.233
(Ve)
Good luck, sweetheart.

42:27.260 --> 42:28.593
Thank you.

42:28.595 --> 42:30.595
I know that I'm better
than what I put out there,

42:30.630 --> 42:32.196
and if I had to do it
all over again,

42:32.232 --> 42:34.649
I would have made
much better choices.

42:36.953 --> 42:38.202
It's me.

42:38.204 --> 42:39.820
I'm leaving
with a lot of knowledge

42:39.856 --> 42:41.472
and a lot of confidence
in myself.

42:41.507 --> 42:43.207
You have such a creative
passion about you,

42:43.259 --> 42:45.843
and I don't want to ever
see you lose that, you know.

42:45.879 --> 42:47.278
Get over here.

42:47.280 --> 42:48.646
[Laughter]

42:48.681 --> 42:50.314
I made it this far on <i> Face Off,</i>

42:50.316 --> 42:52.316
and that's pretty awesome.

42:52.352 --> 42:53.851
I love what I do,

42:53.903 --> 42:56.587
and I'm gonna keep making
my spooky things.
