[Reporter] Coming up on KTLA 5:

00:57.792 --> 00:59.834
This season's hottest Christmas
gifts!

01:00.001 --> 01:02.293
It's November 1st people,
give us a break!

01:23.332 --> 01:24.332
Hi.

01:24.415 --> 01:25.457
How's your day so far?

01:25.540 --> 01:26.707
You heard, right?

01:26.790 --> 01:29.165
Barely into my first episode
and already it's a mess.

01:29.248 --> 01:30.331
Potential mess.

01:30.414 --> 01:32.390
Anyway, why do you think
I recommended you for this job?

01:32.414 --> 01:33.765
Because I haven't worked
in almost a year

01:33.789 --> 01:35.670
and my career was vanishing
before my very eyes?

01:35.706 --> 01:37.039
Guess again.

01:37.122 --> 01:38.372
Because I'm your oldest friend?

01:38.456 --> 01:40.205
Because you're smart
and resourceful,

01:40.206 --> 01:41.327
and good at troubleshooting.

01:41.372 --> 01:43.373
And there's plenty of trouble
to shoot around here.

01:43.456 --> 01:44.456
Now you tell me.

01:44.496 --> 01:45.746
It's true, you can handle it.

01:45.830 --> 01:47.746
Except for getting over
that cheat Marco

01:47.830 --> 01:48.996
and the whole man embargo.

01:49.080 --> 01:50.871
It's been way too long, Soph.

01:50.955 --> 01:53.580
Over Marco. No embargo.
Not looking.

01:53.663 --> 01:55.264
Please! If you're living,
you're looking.

01:57.746 --> 02:00.162
Sophia! Sit, please. Help.

02:01.829 --> 02:03.454
I always thought
the Sexy Santa Society

02:03.537 --> 02:05.787
sounded a little... sketchy.

02:05.870 --> 02:07.263
Who knew they were going
to get busted

02:07.287 --> 02:09.287
for running an
illegal escort ring?

02:09.370 --> 02:11.329
And we just thought they
serviced shopping malls.

02:11.412 --> 02:13.578
They certainly put the "ho"
in "ho-ho-ho."

02:14.036 --> 02:16.012
To be honest, I always thought
doing a whole episode

02:16.036 --> 02:17.703
on the group seemed
a little exploitive.

02:18.078 --> 02:20.203
Even for a show called
"Extreme Holidays."

02:20.703 --> 02:22.703
Oh, I'm sorry we aren't as noble

02:22.786 --> 02:24.869
as the cooking shows
that you were working on.

02:24.953 --> 02:27.493
Yeah, well, there's nothing
noble about getting cancelled.

02:28.368 --> 02:29.535
Or being unemployed.

02:29.618 --> 02:30.452
Ain't that right?

02:30.535 --> 02:32.577
Now, check out the article
I just sent you, okay?

02:32.660 --> 02:35.035
I forgot all about this guy,
but it just might work.

02:36.035 --> 02:39.743
Guy celebrates Christmas
365 days out of the year?

02:39.826 --> 02:41.701
- Yeah.
- I can hardly handle it one day.

02:41.784 --> 02:44.034
That's why we're not doing
a show about you.

02:44.326 --> 02:46.701
What kind of oddball is this
Will Saunders?

02:46.784 --> 02:48.326
A devoted one, apparently.

02:48.409 --> 02:50.659
His house is a shrine
to all things yuletide.

02:50.742 --> 02:52.201
And he does charity work:

02:52.284 --> 02:54.658
kids, pets, and homeless people.

02:54.908 --> 02:56.109
So, he should want to do this.

02:56.158 --> 02:58.158
And, if he's not
a complete freak,

02:58.241 --> 02:59.241
we should want to, too.

02:59.325 --> 03:00.592
I can't even tell
what he looks like

03:00.616 --> 03:01.897
underneath this reindeer get up.

03:02.408 --> 03:04.825
Nothing about his personal life
except for 33,

03:05.325 --> 03:09.032
has a history in production
and carpentry in scenic design.

03:09.115 --> 03:09.990
That makes sense, I guess?

03:10.074 --> 03:12.341
I just sent you the number
from the studio where he works.

03:12.365 --> 03:14.699
I want you to find him,
meet him, and sell him.

03:14.782 --> 03:16.032
You have one day, sorry.

03:16.574 --> 03:17.574
I'm on it!

03:17.782 --> 03:21.365
Oh, and don't forget that
the entire Bravada TV deal,

03:21.448 --> 03:23.573
not to mention your future
as a producer here,

03:23.656 --> 03:25.448
hinges on the success
of this show.

03:25.531 --> 03:27.406
So... no pressure.

03:28.364 --> 03:29.614
None at all.

03:30.406 --> 03:31.406
Thank you!

03:41.863 --> 03:43.363
No Twitter, no Instagram...

03:44.072 --> 03:45.447
Social media ghost.

03:57.821 --> 03:59.112
Hi, is this Will?

03:59.904 --> 04:01.196
Will, this is Sophia Worthy.

04:01.279 --> 04:02.654
I'm with Super Real Productions.

04:02.737 --> 04:05.611
I am producing a new reality
TV show about the holidays,

04:05.695 --> 04:06.695
and we...

04:08.361 --> 04:09.879
I got your phone number
from your work,

04:09.903 --> 04:11.153
I hope that's okay.

04:11.945 --> 04:14.695
Anyway, this whole "every day
is Christmas" thing you do

04:14.778 --> 04:16.028
sounds really...

04:16.653 --> 04:17.944
fascinating...

04:18.027 --> 04:19.485
and I wondered if we could meet

04:19.569 --> 04:21.319
and talk about filming you
for the show?

04:22.860 --> 04:24.402
Oh, can I ask you why not?

04:25.985 --> 04:29.069
Well, yeah, it's reality TV,
but not how you think...

04:31.318 --> 04:32.568
That's a drag.

04:32.651 --> 04:33.960
You know, it really
could have brought

04:33.984 --> 04:36.609
a lot of attention to all that
great charity work you do.

04:38.526 --> 04:39.693
Oh yeah!

04:39.776 --> 04:41.443
It could have been
a big part of it.

04:42.984 --> 04:43.984
Amazing!

04:44.900 --> 04:46.692
How does tomorrow morning sound?

04:47.275 --> 04:48.983
Yes, I do know that place.

04:49.233 --> 04:51.025
10:00 a.m.? Perfect!

04:51.858 --> 04:52.858
I'll see you then.

04:53.108 --> 04:54.108
Okay, bye.

04:57.358 --> 04:58.525
Charmer.

04:59.524 --> 05:00.524
Yes!

05:11.399 --> 05:12.565
Excuse me, Will?

05:13.731 --> 05:15.648
Sophia from
Super Real Productions.

05:17.565 --> 05:18.481
Sorry, my bad.

05:18.565 --> 05:20.440
I thought you were someone else.

05:21.065 --> 05:22.065
Sophia?

05:25.356 --> 05:26.564
You're Will?

05:27.897 --> 05:29.147
You were expecting an elf?

05:29.772 --> 05:30.772
Maybe?

05:31.480 --> 05:32.397
What can I get you?

05:32.480 --> 05:33.814
Oh no, it's on me.

05:34.230 --> 05:37.564
Well, it's on Super Real
Productions, actually.

05:38.314 --> 05:39.355
What do you want?

05:40.230 --> 05:41.688
Thank Super Real,
but it's on me.

05:41.771 --> 05:42.979
No arguments.

05:43.813 --> 05:44.813
Okay.

05:45.146 --> 05:47.146
Medium, non-fat,
half-caf, no foam latte,

05:47.229 --> 05:48.938
with a teaspoon of agave.

05:49.146 --> 05:50.146
Coming right up.

05:54.437 --> 05:59.687
Can I get a medium, non-fat,
no foam, half-caf latte,

05:59.770 --> 06:01.603
with a teaspoon of agave?

06:02.103 --> 06:03.187
Christmas blend,

06:03.270 --> 06:05.770
and just a regular
Christmas blend for me.

06:26.268 --> 06:27.268
Thanks.

06:33.601 --> 06:34.601
What's this?

06:34.851 --> 06:37.184
Just a little something for you.

06:37.267 --> 06:38.184
Open it.

06:38.267 --> 06:40.434
My first gift from
Mr. Christmas.

06:40.892 --> 06:42.309
I could get used to this.

06:42.475 --> 06:43.475
Is that so?

06:44.684 --> 06:45.559
I mean...

06:45.642 --> 06:48.184
I meant, the gifts
you must give...

06:50.016 --> 06:52.308
The pink one's strawberry,
the yellow is lemon,

06:52.391 --> 06:54.308
and the orange is passion fruit.

06:54.849 --> 06:56.808
How did you know I liked
macaroons?

06:57.349 --> 06:58.349
Just a guess.

06:58.808 --> 07:00.933
They seem kind of fancy...
like you.

07:02.183 --> 07:03.183
Fancy?

07:04.015 --> 07:05.015
Interesting.

07:06.265 --> 07:09.098
Hope you like Christmas blend,
I used it for your latte.

07:09.182 --> 07:10.640
It may or may not surprise you

07:10.723 --> 07:12.390
that I wait for it
all year long.

07:12.890 --> 07:15.765
I love Christmas blend,
it's my favorite.

07:15.848 --> 07:16.848
Yay!

07:19.556 --> 07:20.556
So you live around here?

07:20.764 --> 07:22.806
Yeah, I'm in Vista Gardens.

07:23.014 --> 07:25.014
A little bungalow
right in the canyon.

07:25.097 --> 07:26.639
I know the place, actually.

07:26.722 --> 07:27.556
Really?

07:27.639 --> 07:30.181
Yeah, a friend of mine used to
live right next door, I think.

07:30.264 --> 07:31.596
Beautiful spot. Quaint.

07:34.471 --> 07:35.680
So, the show.

07:36.555 --> 07:37.971
The show, right.

07:38.055 --> 07:40.180
Look, I don't want
to disappoint you...

07:40.263 --> 07:41.471
But I'm a pretty low-key guy

07:41.555 --> 07:47.054
and the whole reality show deal
just isn't really my thing.

07:47.720 --> 07:51.054
And honestly, people don't
understand what I do.

07:51.429 --> 07:52.512
Or why I do it.

07:54.262 --> 07:55.804
Then let's change their mind.

07:56.179 --> 07:59.012
You could create a whole
new massive wave

07:59.095 --> 08:00.803
of Christmas enthusiasm!

08:01.761 --> 08:03.303
What's in it for you, exactly?

08:03.928 --> 08:05.428
A skeptic, are we?

08:05.844 --> 08:07.219
Been down this road before.

08:09.761 --> 08:11.761
Okay... the truth?

08:15.010 --> 08:16.343
Our story just fell through

08:16.427 --> 08:18.927
and if we don't find a new one
ASAP we're screwed.

08:19.552 --> 08:22.510
My last show went belly up
and I need to prove myself.

08:22.885 --> 08:23.885
To be honest with you,

08:23.968 --> 08:25.649
I don't know if you are right
for the show,

08:25.718 --> 08:27.342
not until I see your house.

08:28.467 --> 08:29.342
But after meeting you,

08:29.426 --> 08:31.509
I think you could be
great on television.

08:31.592 --> 08:33.134
How's that, mystery man?

08:34.426 --> 08:36.884
That was honest. I'm impressed.

08:39.134 --> 08:40.509
And between you and me,

08:40.592 --> 08:42.924
I am cuckoo for Christmas.

08:47.466 --> 08:50.425
Producing a show like this
would be a dream come true.

08:50.966 --> 08:52.425
If you like my house.

08:52.508 --> 08:54.300
Right, I'd have to see
your house first.

08:55.215 --> 08:56.340
So can I?

08:56.424 --> 08:58.632
I'm not sure.
I'll have to think about it.

08:58.674 --> 09:00.757
Right, of course. Think about it
and let me know.

09:01.299 --> 09:03.090
But I have to know
by the end of the day.

09:03.632 --> 09:04.549
[Paul] So...

09:04.632 --> 09:07.132
he's not the oddball you
thought he was going to be?

09:07.215 --> 09:09.548
Nope, he's actually
kind of a regular guy

09:09.631 --> 09:11.048
with an irregular hobby.

09:11.256 --> 09:13.339
And he's also kind of
on the hot side.

09:14.423 --> 09:15.839
Really? How hot?

09:16.381 --> 09:19.631
Like fireman meets GQ model
meets superhero hot.

09:20.756 --> 09:21.881
You're going to like him.

09:22.256 --> 09:23.130
I'm married.

09:23.213 --> 09:25.422
I don't have the luxury
of liking anyone anymore.

09:32.172 --> 09:33.505
4:45.

09:34.838 --> 09:35.838
End of day.

09:42.879 --> 09:45.962
[cell phone vibrating]

09:46.546 --> 09:47.546
Hey.

09:47.754 --> 09:50.129
Will? Hi, it's Sophia Worthy.

09:50.212 --> 09:52.003
Ah, Sophia Worthy.

09:52.086 --> 09:53.670
Is it the end of the day
already?

09:53.753 --> 09:54.920
We're getting there.

09:55.003 --> 09:56.295
So, what did you decide?

09:56.670 --> 09:57.896
Wow, cutting right to the chase.

09:57.920 --> 09:59.354
Listen Will, if you're
not going to do it,

09:59.378 --> 10:00.420
please just tell me now.

10:00.753 --> 10:02.461
Okay, I don't want to do it.

10:02.920 --> 10:03.920
Oh...

10:04.627 --> 10:06.085
But that doesn't mean I won't.

10:06.169 --> 10:07.460
Or that I will.

10:08.002 --> 10:09.252
I'm confused.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.252
At this point, all I can offer

10:11.335 --> 10:13.127
is an invitation for you
to see my home.

10:15.002 --> 10:16.210
How's half an hour?

10:16.294 --> 10:18.044
Nothing like playing
hard to get.

10:18.126 --> 10:19.334
Is that what you're doing?

10:20.334 --> 10:21.834
Let me give you my address.

10:45.957 --> 10:46.957
[door knocking]

10:49.666 --> 10:50.832
- Hi.
- Hey.

10:50.916 --> 10:52.499
Welcome to my humble abode.

10:52.957 --> 10:55.124
Humble? More like amazing.

10:56.249 --> 10:58.916
It was my grandparents home.
I inherited it.

11:00.623 --> 11:01.623
And who's this?

11:02.415 --> 11:04.040
This is Romeo.

11:04.581 --> 11:06.081
My vicious guard dog.

11:08.498 --> 11:10.123
They're a pretty good
judge of character.

11:12.290 --> 11:13.331
Come on!

11:15.289 --> 11:18.330
I'd say holy cow,
but I'm assuming

11:18.414 --> 11:20.205
you've probably
heard something like it.

11:20.289 --> 11:21.997
Doesn't get old, trust me.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.247
How do you keep
those floating like that?

11:24.330 --> 11:27.497
They're suspended on a filament
that washes out in the light.

11:27.704 --> 11:28.746
Tricky.

11:28.829 --> 11:30.704
Tricks of the trade
in the movie business.

11:31.538 --> 11:32.538
Follow me.

11:35.079 --> 11:37.163
Oh, and don't mind
the mistletoe.

11:37.829 --> 11:38.871
It's everywhere.

11:40.079 --> 11:41.537
Thanks for the warning.

11:45.620 --> 11:46.620
Wow...

11:47.787 --> 11:49.348
How do you keep
those snowing like that?

11:49.412 --> 11:52.162
Wait, don't tell me!
More trade secrets?

11:54.537 --> 11:56.702
So, how did this all start?

11:56.786 --> 11:58.286
Honestly, I've always
loved Christmas.

11:58.369 --> 12:01.244
You could call me
a Christmas enthusiast.

12:02.286 --> 12:04.577
7 or 8 years ago I was working
on a small Christmas movie

12:04.661 --> 12:05.994
that ran out of money.

12:06.077 --> 12:09.576
So they paid me with
scenery and special effects.

12:09.660 --> 12:10.927
Which was cool,
but then I thought

12:10.951 --> 12:12.743
where the hell am I
going to put it all

12:12.826 --> 12:14.118
when it's not Christmas?

12:14.243 --> 12:15.618
And the rest is history?

12:15.701 --> 12:17.660
Or hysteria, take your pick.

12:19.868 --> 12:22.660
It's gorgeous.
And a little trippy.

12:22.993 --> 12:24.325
But in a good way!

12:24.909 --> 12:25.909
Over here, come on.

12:26.742 --> 12:29.784
May I present:
Christmas under the Sea.

12:29.867 --> 12:32.700
It is so romantic. And peaceful.

12:32.867 --> 12:34.117
Unless you're the seasick type.

12:34.450 --> 12:35.617
Which I'm not.

12:37.074 --> 12:38.783
A friend of yours?

12:38.866 --> 12:40.949
Oh yeah, that's
my second cousin, Ariel.

12:45.199 --> 12:46.783
He loves the ladies, that one.

12:47.449 --> 12:50.865
Little Romeo - did you teach him
everything he knows?

12:50.948 --> 12:52.157
Just gave him the name.

12:52.865 --> 12:53.990
Good answer.

12:54.240 --> 12:56.948
So... how long have you
lived here for?

12:57.532 --> 12:58.865
You said you inherited it?

12:59.198 --> 13:01.323
From my grandparents,
those two right there.

13:01.407 --> 13:02.448
It's so modern.

13:02.990 --> 13:06.364
I had to gut the entire home:
Interior, exterior...

13:06.822 --> 13:08.114
But I kept the original bones.

13:08.197 --> 13:11.656
So now, it's modern
with a heritage spine.

13:11.739 --> 13:14.864
What about your parents?
They didn't want the house?

13:15.656 --> 13:18.821
I'm sure they would have,
but they died when I was a kid.

13:19.113 --> 13:21.780
Long story, but I actually grew
up here.

13:21.863 --> 13:23.030
With my grandparents.

13:23.113 --> 13:24.655
Who were major Christmas fans,

13:24.738 --> 13:26.530
and my inspiration
when I decided

13:26.613 --> 13:29.571
to turn my home into a
Christmas extravaganza.

13:30.946 --> 13:32.321
Extravagant it is.

13:33.820 --> 13:35.654
Pop quiz,
Miss Cuckoo for Christmas:

13:35.862 --> 13:37.223
who's your favorite
ornament maker?

13:38.029 --> 13:39.029
Me?

13:40.695 --> 13:43.070
I don't know, I would say
I'm kind of like

13:43.154 --> 13:45.195
an equal opportunity
ornament fan.

13:45.737 --> 13:47.153
Ah, I get it.

13:47.653 --> 13:49.611
Wouldn't want to offend
any of Santa's helpers.

13:49.944 --> 13:50.944
Exactly!

14:00.111 --> 14:02.693
And here we have
"The Train Room".

14:04.027 --> 14:05.068
All aboard?

14:07.277 --> 14:08.610
It's amazing.

14:09.027 --> 14:11.693
My grandpa was a big collector
who got me going on it.

14:11.777 --> 14:14.192
And when I started doing
all this to my home,

14:14.276 --> 14:16.026
the train set grew like crazy.

14:16.526 --> 14:18.484
I'm always working on it,
it keeps me busy...

14:18.567 --> 14:19.901
And out of trouble!

14:20.859 --> 14:21.859
Sorry about that!

14:21.942 --> 14:23.276
Hank, meet Sophia.

14:23.359 --> 14:24.734
Sophia, Hank: my right hand man.

14:24.817 --> 14:25.817
Nice to meet you.

14:25.859 --> 14:27.234
Nice to meet you, Sophia.

14:27.317 --> 14:30.025
Sophia wants to make us
TV stars.

14:30.275 --> 14:32.108
Will hasn't agreed to it yet.

14:32.275 --> 14:33.650
Help me out, would you?

14:36.108 --> 14:37.566
You guys, this looks so good.

14:37.650 --> 14:39.025
It's going to look amazing
on TV.

14:39.108 --> 14:40.733
Which I haven't agreed to, yet.

14:40.816 --> 14:42.232
Sorry, I know.

14:42.357 --> 14:44.774
I'm a producer,
the wheels are always turning.

14:45.440 --> 14:46.440
Right.

14:47.065 --> 14:48.232
Want to see it in action?

14:48.315 --> 14:49.315
Yeah.

14:49.482 --> 14:50.524
Check it out.

15:00.689 --> 15:01.856
So good!

15:05.148 --> 15:06.398
Hank seems nice.

15:06.523 --> 15:07.814
He's the best.

15:07.898 --> 15:10.188
He stays here sometimes
when the shelter's full.

15:10.522 --> 15:12.203
And I hire him for odd jobs
here and there.

15:12.230 --> 15:13.272
He's homeless?

15:13.355 --> 15:15.188
Without a permanent home.
For now.

15:15.272 --> 15:18.063
He had one, lost it.
Amongst other things.

15:18.397 --> 15:19.563
We're working on it.

15:21.105 --> 15:23.272
Will, your house is wonderful.

15:23.937 --> 15:27.312
I would love for you and
your home to star in our show.

15:27.396 --> 15:28.562
So what do you think?

15:28.646 --> 15:29.979
I think...

15:31.062 --> 15:33.396
How do I know you won't
make me look like an idiot?

15:34.146 --> 15:36.146
You've just got to trust me,
I guess.

15:36.354 --> 15:37.354
Yeah?

15:37.603 --> 15:38.603
Yeah.

15:39.811 --> 15:40.686
For what it's worth,

15:40.770 --> 15:42.145
I'd like to mention that I was

15:42.228 --> 15:44.311
a documentary film major
in college.

15:44.395 --> 15:45.978
So I know how to get to
the truth.

15:46.311 --> 15:47.395
Really?

15:47.978 --> 15:49.478
So why reality TV?

15:50.395 --> 15:52.727
I suppose real life
got in the way?

15:52.935 --> 15:55.185
Something called paying
the bills came knocking.

15:55.519 --> 15:56.685
Fair enough.

15:56.769 --> 15:58.602
I'd also like to mention
that we are willing

15:58.685 --> 16:02.102
to make a serious donation
to a charity of choice.

16:02.977 --> 16:04.435
You're killing me.

16:07.018 --> 16:08.018
I just...

16:10.101 --> 16:11.184
I don't know.

16:12.809 --> 16:15.518
Your house is unbelievable,
Will.

16:15.934 --> 16:18.851
The way you do Christmas and
the legacy of your grandparents.

16:19.225 --> 16:21.933
How great would it be to,
on screen,

16:22.017 --> 16:24.558
show everybody
the beauty of that?

16:24.808 --> 16:27.308
I just know that people
would flip over you,

16:27.392 --> 16:28.725
and your home and your story.

16:28.808 --> 16:30.767
And why you do it,
and how you do it.

16:32.642 --> 16:34.224
Your house is one of a kind.

16:35.224 --> 16:36.391
You're one of a kind.

16:45.057 --> 16:47.348
I have to confer with
my business manager.

16:51.765 --> 16:52.966
[whispering]
What do you think?

16:56.390 --> 16:57.390
Okay.

16:57.473 --> 16:58.306
Okay?

16:58.390 --> 16:59.473
We'll do it.

17:00.515 --> 17:02.847
Will, this is amazing!
Thank you!

17:03.222 --> 17:04.972
You are not going
to regret this!

17:13.138 --> 17:14.472
Who's the happy camper?

17:16.804 --> 17:18.179
Oh, you'll find out...

17:36.595 --> 17:38.053
Wow, what a beauty!

17:38.137 --> 17:40.053
Imagine when it's all
decorated and lit up!

17:40.137 --> 17:41.470
I bet the crowds are crazy.

17:41.887 --> 17:43.927
Yes, but his crabby neighbor
hates those crowds.

17:44.011 --> 17:45.052
He got an injunction,

17:45.136 --> 17:47.677
so he's not allowed to start
decorating until Thanksgiving.

17:47.761 --> 17:49.011
Nice neighbor.

17:49.094 --> 17:50.344
So, plan accordingly, Linz.

17:50.427 --> 17:51.427
I know the type.

17:51.511 --> 17:54.219
He'll be the first to want a
location fee. Guaranteed.

17:54.302 --> 17:55.302
Let's go!

18:01.093 --> 18:02.260
The gang?

18:02.343 --> 18:05.718
Yes. Will, this is Lindsey,
Kayla, and Aaron.

18:06.093 --> 18:08.135
Our A-team of lights,
camera and...

18:08.218 --> 18:09.468
- Action?
- Sound.

18:09.551 --> 18:11.925
Action is good too, Will.

18:13.884 --> 18:16.967
And this is Romeo, our
Extreme Holidays mascot.

18:17.050 --> 18:18.592
Romeo, are you ready
for your close-up?

18:18.675 --> 18:20.092
At least one of us is.

18:28.133 --> 18:30.049
Let me know if you have
any questions, okay?

18:30.674 --> 18:32.299
Yeah, I got one.

18:32.758 --> 18:34.341
Got any idea what
a nightmare it is

18:34.424 --> 18:37.591
to shoot all this white
on white on white?

18:37.674 --> 18:39.590
Sorry, I didn't design it
with TV in mind, dude.

18:39.673 --> 18:41.798
Relax, Aaron.
I've seen you shoot tougher.

18:41.882 --> 18:44.632
All these projections could
be pretty tricky to light.

18:44.923 --> 18:46.007
Thanks, Kayla.

18:50.007 --> 18:51.090
Are you okay?

18:52.089 --> 18:54.131
Yeah, just taking it all in.

18:56.672 --> 18:58.631
Do you mind if they get
a lay of the land?

18:58.714 --> 18:59.881
Check things out a bit?

19:00.464 --> 19:02.464
Okay, that would be great.
Give us some more time.

19:02.547 --> 19:03.756
Fan out everyone!

19:03.839 --> 19:05.963
Just don't go in any rooms
that are being redone!

19:06.046 --> 19:07.588
And watch out for wet paint!

19:07.671 --> 19:08.671
It's okay.

19:11.588 --> 19:14.171
Your beautiful house is in
good hands. I promise.

19:15.838 --> 19:16.921
As are you.

19:19.671 --> 19:21.045
I'm going to hold you to that.

19:24.087 --> 19:26.379
I'm gonna go follow them.
You want to join?

19:27.004 --> 19:28.379
Sure, after you.

19:30.379 --> 19:31.545
Thanks a lot, Will.

19:31.629 --> 19:33.628
We'll see you Monday morning.

19:34.378 --> 19:36.919
Monday? Like four days
from today, Monday?

19:37.461 --> 19:39.145
Didn't you say your hiatus
started in four days?

19:39.169 --> 19:41.419
Yeah, but I've got a ton
of work to do on the house.

19:41.503 --> 19:42.378
No worries, Will.

19:42.461 --> 19:44.003
That's why the
crew is here to help.

19:44.086 --> 19:47.086
No crew. Just me
and Hank only, please.

19:47.169 --> 19:48.561
You know what?
Why don't you guys go?

19:48.585 --> 19:49.728
I'm just going to grab an Uber

19:49.752 --> 19:51.186
and chat with Will
about a few things.

19:51.210 --> 19:52.210
Shotgun!

19:59.585 --> 20:00.585
Fred!

20:03.876 --> 20:05.157
What's all the hubbub, Saunders?

20:05.376 --> 20:06.626
Reality TV show.

20:06.834 --> 20:08.167
This is my producer, Sophia.

20:08.251 --> 20:09.542
Sophia, meet Fred.

20:09.626 --> 20:10.626
Hi!

20:10.959 --> 20:12.084
Television, huh?

20:12.376 --> 20:14.709
How much are you paying
for our inconvenience?

20:15.209 --> 20:17.958
Don't worry, you'll be
compensated for your trouble.

20:18.333 --> 20:20.416
The producer is going to
reach out to you shortly.

20:20.500 --> 20:21.541
She better.

20:22.041 --> 20:24.166
Put up with enough
as it is around here.

20:27.541 --> 20:30.374
So... you want a drink?

20:31.665 --> 20:33.749
Yeah, I could have some water.

20:35.040 --> 20:36.665
I can facilitate that.

20:39.707 --> 20:41.624
So, you should have
your contract by tomorrow.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.520
Let me know if you have
any questions.

20:43.706 --> 20:44.956
So I can still back out?

20:45.914 --> 20:46.914
Seriously?

20:48.081 --> 20:51.998
Listen: Christmas means
all the world to me.

20:52.081 --> 20:53.414
Obviously, you can see.

20:53.498 --> 20:55.581
And I do this to share it
with others.

20:56.331 --> 20:59.872
But personally. One-on-one.
My way.

21:00.663 --> 21:01.872
What's that supposed to mean?

21:02.330 --> 21:04.080
Maybe I jumped into this
too quickly.

21:05.288 --> 21:06.580
I do that sometimes.

21:07.663 --> 21:10.538
Listen: this is going to
be hectic, inconvenient,

21:10.622 --> 21:13.037
and a total disruption
of your nice, cozy life.

21:13.829 --> 21:15.829
But you won't regret it.
I promise.

21:39.619 --> 21:42.577
Umm... I've gotta go.
I should go.

21:49.119 --> 21:50.119
All right...

21:51.077 --> 21:54.034
I will see you later, I guess.

21:54.159 --> 21:55.368
Looking forward to it.

21:56.409 --> 21:57.409
Okay!

22:04.743 --> 22:06.801
These people haven't given you
much time to get ready,

22:06.825 --> 22:07.658
have they?

22:07.742 --> 22:08.992
I'll never really be ready.

22:09.075 --> 22:10.575
Don't ask me why I'm doing this.

22:11.117 --> 22:13.033
Oh, I know why
you're doing this.

22:13.575 --> 22:14.617
That obvious?

22:15.367 --> 22:18.450
She's beautiful.
And smart, and persuasive.

22:19.283 --> 22:21.782
The way I see it is if I can
help

22:21.866 --> 22:23.241
promote the charities I
work with,

22:23.324 --> 22:26.074
use the show for good,
then I guess it's worth it.

22:26.241 --> 22:28.866
Maybe it's a good opportunity
to talk about the shelter.

22:28.949 --> 22:31.574
That's a good idea, Hank.
I'll put that on the wish list.

22:31.657 --> 22:32.907
Along with Sophia?

22:40.073 --> 22:41.073
Oww!

22:44.281 --> 22:47.406
Oh my gosh, it is perfect.

22:47.656 --> 22:48.656
There he is!

22:49.280 --> 22:50.697
Hi, I'm Paul Rivera.

22:50.780 --> 22:52.864
I'm the executive producer
and creator of the show.

22:52.947 --> 22:53.780
Hi!

22:53.864 --> 22:55.655
AKA my boss, so you've
got to be nice to him.

22:56.614 --> 22:59.447
I absolutely love what
you've done with the place.

22:59.530 --> 23:00.364
It is wonderful.

23:00.447 --> 23:02.988
Our only hope is that
we can do it justice.

23:03.446 --> 23:04.946
And you, too, of course.

23:06.238 --> 23:07.321
Why don't you come with me?

23:07.404 --> 23:09.113
I'm going to give you
a rundown of the day.

23:09.196 --> 23:10.613
Great, we'll see you in a bit.

23:12.779 --> 23:14.821
Nice to see you again,
Miss producer.

23:15.404 --> 23:17.153
It's nice to see you again, too.

23:18.487 --> 23:23.195
Okay, so today is mostly just
going to be shots of the house,

23:23.278 --> 23:27.528
bits and pieces of you
talking and explaining

23:27.612 --> 23:29.028
and we're going to get
a shot of you

23:29.112 --> 23:30.402
greeting us at the front door.

23:30.486 --> 23:31.361
Does that sound good?

23:31.444 --> 23:33.027
Yeah. I guess.

23:34.111 --> 23:35.111
As the old saying goes:

23:35.152 --> 23:36.753
if it doesn't work,
we'll just fix it in post.

23:36.777 --> 23:38.069
That's what I'm afraid of.

23:39.402 --> 23:40.402
Don't worry.

23:44.026 --> 23:46.235
I figured you like
to make lists.

23:46.318 --> 23:49.276
Here's mine: these are some
of the charities I work with.

23:49.360 --> 23:52.068
I think it would be good to
put them in the interviews.

23:53.568 --> 23:54.443
Got it.

23:54.526 --> 23:55.836
Okay, while they're getting
set up,

23:55.860 --> 23:57.002
let's get you in
hair and makeup.

23:57.026 --> 23:58.026
Makeup?

23:58.567 --> 24:00.192
No, I don't wear makeup.

24:00.442 --> 24:02.192
On camera everyone wears makeup.

24:02.275 --> 24:03.192
Is this our boy, Soph?

24:03.275 --> 24:04.484
Yes Gia, this is Will.

24:05.859 --> 24:06.859
Sit.

24:08.067 --> 24:09.317
Smile. Look pretty.

24:09.400 --> 24:11.317
Which shouldn't be
a problem for you.

24:12.483 --> 24:13.316
Will, look,

24:13.399 --> 24:15.733
I know a lot of guys don't
like the whole makeup idea,

24:15.816 --> 24:17.149
but the point is
to make you look

24:17.233 --> 24:18.417
like you don't
have on makeup on.

24:18.441 --> 24:21.108
Let me get this straight,
you want to put makeup on me

24:21.191 --> 24:24.024
so I look like I don't
have makeup on me?

24:24.108 --> 24:26.732
That is why they call it
reality TV!

24:26.815 --> 24:27.648
How we doing?

24:27.732 --> 24:29.523
Good! Just getting
golden boy ready.

24:29.607 --> 24:31.357
So, what do you think?

24:31.440 --> 24:32.523
Dude, or dwarf?

24:32.607 --> 24:33.440
What for?

24:33.523 --> 24:35.482
For Will. To wear
in the opening shot.

24:35.565 --> 24:36.806
We never discussed a costume...

24:36.857 --> 24:38.148
Please hold still, Will.

24:38.232 --> 24:39.689
I'm not wearing a costume.

24:39.772 --> 24:42.439
What about the reindeer suit
you wore in that article?

24:42.522 --> 24:43.356
That was a costume.

24:43.439 --> 24:45.522
I was playing Rudolph
for the kids, for charity.

24:45.606 --> 24:46.647
One time!

24:47.147 --> 24:49.189
Well, now you'll be playing
Christmas dude.

24:49.272 --> 24:50.272
Or dwarf.

24:50.356 --> 24:51.897
Ta-dah! Adorable.

24:51.981 --> 24:53.271
I don't want to look "adorable."

24:53.355 --> 24:55.271
Okay, honey,
that ship has sailed.

24:55.355 --> 24:57.271
She just means we love
the way you look already.

24:57.355 --> 25:00.521
We do, but the audience
has a certain expectation.

25:00.605 --> 25:02.271
Namely, holiday cheer.

25:02.355 --> 25:04.855
So let's be cheery, shall we?

25:06.646 --> 25:08.020
Take this. Thank you.

25:08.729 --> 25:09.937
Did you know about this?

25:10.020 --> 25:11.104
I had no idea.

25:11.770 --> 25:16.729
Look, you told me that
sometimes you can be impulsive.

25:17.645 --> 25:19.729
So... how about now?

25:27.269 --> 25:28.353
That's the one.

25:29.561 --> 25:30.811
Okay, Will.

25:30.894 --> 25:32.353
Sophia is going to call action.

25:32.436 --> 25:34.727
You're going to open the door
and say your first line.

25:34.810 --> 25:37.143
Then you're going to step back,
open the door a little more

25:37.227 --> 25:39.102
like you're inviting us
into your home,

25:39.185 --> 25:40.518
and Aaron is going to do

25:40.602 --> 25:42.560
a beautiful tracking shot
right inside.

25:42.643 --> 25:43.477
Cool?

25:43.643 --> 25:44.560
What's my line?

25:44.643 --> 25:46.143
Oh sorry, it's...

25:47.018 --> 25:49.309
Hi, I'm Will Saunders.

25:49.392 --> 25:51.809
Welcome to my magical
Christmas wonderland!

25:52.267 --> 25:53.976
Isn't that a little corny?

25:54.392 --> 25:55.684
Christmas is corny.

25:56.476 --> 25:57.351
Not to me.

25:57.434 --> 25:58.743
Why don't we just drop
the "magical"

25:58.767 --> 26:00.309
and stick with the rest?

26:01.434 --> 26:02.434
Okay.

26:03.808 --> 26:04.808
And...

26:05.808 --> 26:06.808
Action!

26:08.141 --> 26:09.683
Hi, I'm Will Saunders

26:09.766 --> 26:11.850
and welcome to my
Christmas wonderland.

26:13.891 --> 26:14.891
Cut!

26:15.433 --> 26:16.433
Let's go again, Will.

26:16.515 --> 26:18.265
This time just
a little livelier.

26:19.849 --> 26:21.724
Ready, and... action!

26:22.390 --> 26:24.349
Hi, I'm Will Saunders

26:24.432 --> 26:26.765
and welcome to my
Christmas wonderland.

26:27.932 --> 26:28.932
Again!

26:29.057 --> 26:30.389
Okay that was a lot better,
Will.

26:30.473 --> 26:32.473
We're just going to go
one more time. Good work.

26:32.848 --> 26:33.973
And... action!

26:35.181 --> 26:36.973
Hi, I'm Will Saunders

26:37.056 --> 26:39.264
and welcome to my
Christmas wonderland.

26:39.348 --> 26:40.348
Cut!

26:42.098 --> 26:44.098
Okay Will, This is television.

26:44.180 --> 26:46.888
You need to pretend to be happy,
okay?

26:46.972 --> 26:48.680
You're super excited
about your house

26:48.763 --> 26:50.448
and you can't wait to
share it with the world.

26:50.472 --> 26:52.597
But I'm not and
I look ridiculous.

26:52.847 --> 26:54.888
Fake it, Will. It's TV.

26:55.722 --> 26:57.031
How about we get rid
of the shirt?

26:57.055 --> 26:58.055
We love the shirt.

26:58.387 --> 27:00.054
Not all of us love the shirt.

27:00.137 --> 27:03.304
Hugo? Can you please get
his shirt from the green room?

27:03.471 --> 27:04.471
-On it!

27:32.135 --> 27:34.344
Okay. Let's try that again.

27:35.552 --> 27:37.844
Ready? And... action!

27:38.802 --> 27:40.176
Hey, I'm Will Saunders

27:40.259 --> 27:41.968
and welcome to my
Christmas wonderland.

27:42.676 --> 27:43.759
And cut!

27:44.259 --> 27:45.259
That was perfect, Will!

27:45.718 --> 27:46.551
Really?

27:46.676 --> 27:47.718
Oh yeah.

27:48.509 --> 27:49.509
Super.

27:52.051 --> 27:53.967
So Will, first thing's first.

27:54.508 --> 27:55.925
What do you think sets you apart

27:56.008 --> 27:58.467
from other Christmas
enthusiasts?

27:59.217 --> 28:01.883
I don't know, I guess
when it comes to Christmas,

28:01.967 --> 28:03.883
I'm all in. 110%.

28:05.342 --> 28:07.632
You could say 365%.

28:07.799 --> 28:10.716
Very true. But I can't take
all the credit.

28:10.799 --> 28:12.299
I had a lot of help
along the way.

28:12.382 --> 28:15.007
Starting with my grandparents.
My grandma actually...

28:15.091 --> 28:18.049
I'm sorry, grandparents?
Will, I'm curious.

28:18.132 --> 28:20.299
You're a young, strapping lad.

28:20.382 --> 28:23.131
You're single, you probably have
a very active dating life,

28:23.215 --> 28:25.840
how do women react when you
bring them back here?

28:25.923 --> 28:27.173
Women?

28:28.506 --> 28:33.006
They like it, I guess,
but usually everyone does...

28:33.715 --> 28:38.130
So you could say that this place
is kind of a chick magnet?

28:38.839 --> 28:39.755
Chick magnet?

28:39.839 --> 28:42.464
Yeah! They come and see
all the Christmas joy

28:42.547 --> 28:44.065
and they're like, "Which way
to the sleigh bed?"

28:44.089 --> 28:45.089
Am I right?

28:45.422 --> 28:47.380
I'm sorry, what kind of
questions are these?

28:47.464 --> 28:48.380
Fun ones!

28:48.464 --> 28:50.754
Will come on, we love hearing
about your grandma

28:50.838 --> 28:52.230
and all that stuff,
yadda, yadda, yadda.

28:52.254 --> 28:53.171
It's great.

28:53.254 --> 28:54.546
But look at you:

28:54.629 --> 28:58.254
you're a fireman meets
GQ model meets superhero.

28:58.504 --> 28:59.963
So, Christmas aside,

29:00.421 --> 29:02.355
the folks are going to want
to hear a little dirt.

29:02.379 --> 29:03.462
I think I need a break.

29:03.545 --> 29:06.337
Yeah, of course.
Everyone take five!

29:08.128 --> 29:08.962
Really?

29:09.045 --> 29:10.045
What?

29:10.212 --> 29:12.003
I thought it was a
legitimate question.

29:12.087 --> 29:14.003
You asked where
the sleigh bed was.

29:28.252 --> 29:30.544
I know that was
kind of weird, but...

29:30.627 --> 29:32.793
Paul was just doing his job.

29:33.668 --> 29:36.668
What are you two like
good cop and bad cop?

29:36.751 --> 29:38.418
What? No!

29:39.210 --> 29:40.793
Wait, I'm the good cop, right?

29:42.418 --> 29:43.418
You tell me.

29:44.460 --> 29:46.125
Look, we had a deal.

29:46.209 --> 29:48.584
And it didn't include me
talking about my love life.

29:50.250 --> 29:52.250
He was trying to loosen you up,

29:52.334 --> 29:53.542
in his own way.

29:54.209 --> 29:56.143
I'm sure none of it's going
to end up on the show.

29:56.167 --> 29:58.749
Sophia, this is my life.
It's important to me.

30:00.124 --> 30:02.374
I don't pretend to be perfect,
far from it.

30:02.458 --> 30:05.458
But I try to stand for
a few good things.

30:05.541 --> 30:07.499
And that comes across
loud and clear.

30:09.541 --> 30:12.416
Look, just say
what you want to say.

30:12.498 --> 30:13.915
Forget about the questions.

30:14.332 --> 30:15.623
Don't listen to Paul.

30:15.707 --> 30:17.457
It will slide off of him
like Teflon.

30:19.540 --> 30:21.082
Just take a deep breath.

30:21.873 --> 30:23.540
I know this is weird and new.

30:28.039 --> 30:29.581
It sure feels nice.

30:31.289 --> 30:32.122
I meant...

30:32.206 --> 30:33.622
I know what you meant.

30:35.206 --> 30:36.747
But it still feels nice.

30:39.831 --> 30:41.580
Hey, maybe we could...

30:42.580 --> 30:45.246
donate the leftover lunch food
to the shelter?

30:45.330 --> 30:46.746
I could get Hank to pick it up.

30:46.830 --> 30:50.413
Yeah. I'll have to ask Lindsey,
but I don't see why not.

30:50.913 --> 30:53.913
Thanks, Sophia. That'd be great.

30:55.995 --> 30:58.745
All right, are you ready to face
the big bad cameras again?

31:00.037 --> 31:01.579
I only need you
for one more shot.

31:01.662 --> 31:02.662
All right...

31:03.204 --> 31:05.287
No one has ever asked
to donate leftovers

31:05.370 --> 31:07.704
to any other place than
their own refrigerator.

31:07.787 --> 31:10.536
This guy is sexy and saintly.

31:10.911 --> 31:12.161
So we can do it then?

31:12.244 --> 31:14.369
To keep our star happy? Sure.

31:14.619 --> 31:16.411
Oh, no! I left him with Paul.

31:16.661 --> 31:18.119
I really hope he's okay.

31:18.744 --> 31:20.994
See? You don't have
to worry about Paul.

31:21.078 --> 31:22.368
One thing I know about Paul:

31:22.452 --> 31:24.577
he knows how to charm
the pants off of anyone.

31:24.827 --> 31:26.577
I have a feeling those
particular pants

31:26.660 --> 31:27.785
are going to be staying on.

31:27.868 --> 31:29.118
Maybe for Paul...

31:29.785 --> 31:31.035
What's that supposed to mean?

31:31.577 --> 31:33.660
I've seen the way
he looks at you.

31:34.160 --> 31:36.076
So what are you going
to do about it, sunshine?

31:36.992 --> 31:38.492
I'm going to get this last shot.

31:38.576 --> 31:41.117
And stay away from all
mistletoe at every cost.

31:41.201 --> 31:44.284
Is that a professional decision
or that whole

31:44.367 --> 31:47.576
"all hot dudes are heartbreakers"
thing you got going on?

31:47.867 --> 31:51.866
Sweetie, not every guy you
like is gonna turn into Marco.

31:52.075 --> 31:56.033
It is statistically and
physically impossible!

31:58.325 --> 31:59.991
Thank you, have a good day!

32:00.408 --> 32:01.575
You too, bye!

32:03.075 --> 32:05.032
All right, let's go!
Up top, Will!

32:05.449 --> 32:06.449
No?

32:06.782 --> 32:09.032
Are you the fist bump type?
I'm good with that.

32:14.199 --> 32:15.449
I know there were some hiccups,

32:15.532 --> 32:18.531
but you actually
kind of rocked it.

32:19.114 --> 32:19.948
You're welcome.

32:20.031 --> 32:21.406
Is that what I'm
supposed to say?

32:21.489 --> 32:25.323
I saw you chuckling with Paul.
You were making friendly.

32:25.573 --> 32:26.573
That's a good sign.

32:26.906 --> 32:29.698
There are only a few
fleeting pockets of horrible.

32:30.823 --> 32:32.863
Better than I expected.
How's that?

32:33.280 --> 32:34.738
I'm going to give
you some advice.

32:34.834 --> 32:38.959
Have a beer, or six,
and a nice dinner,

32:39.167 --> 32:40.834
and get a good sleep.

32:42.613 --> 32:43.655
Want to join me on that?

32:45.737 --> 32:47.446
Join you for dinner?

32:51.237 --> 32:52.737
Actually, I can't.

32:54.446 --> 32:57.404
As much as I kind of,
really want to.

33:01.028 --> 33:03.653
I'll take "really kind of want
to" for the future.

33:05.986 --> 33:06.986
Good night, Sophia.

33:07.820 --> 33:08.945
Good night, Will.

33:13.860 --> 33:17.694
[TV on in background]

33:17.777 --> 33:19.194
[door knocking]

33:41.983 --> 33:42.983
Hi.

33:43.483 --> 33:45.483
- Will?
- Sophia!

33:47.275 --> 33:48.775
What are you doing here?

33:48.858 --> 33:50.150
How do you know where I live?

33:50.233 --> 33:53.025
(A) I get nicer greetings
at the DMV.

33:53.442 --> 33:55.524
(B) You told me
when we first met.

33:55.982 --> 33:58.191
(C) Can I come in?

33:59.649 --> 34:01.066
Yeah, sure...

34:02.607 --> 34:03.857
I hope you like irises.

34:04.816 --> 34:07.482
I do! They're beautiful.

34:07.649 --> 34:09.856
From my front lawn.
But flowers all the same.

34:10.523 --> 34:14.523
Very Van Gogh of you.
What are they for?

34:15.356 --> 34:18.273
An apology. For being
such a grouch today.

34:18.731 --> 34:19.565
A grouch?

34:19.648 --> 34:20.648
I kinda was...

34:21.315 --> 34:24.022
But I also needed an excuse
to come over here.

34:24.355 --> 34:25.397
Right.

34:25.480 --> 34:29.188
Thinking about the questions
Paul was asking today.

34:30.355 --> 34:32.647
About me being a chick magnet.

34:33.647 --> 34:35.147
And I just wanted
to clarify that

34:35.230 --> 34:37.271
I am not some sort of player.

34:37.438 --> 34:39.521
Thank you... I think.

34:40.563 --> 34:44.103
It felt like Paul was kind of
trying to make me seem like one.

34:44.188 --> 34:45.813
You know, for
television entertainment.

34:45.896 --> 34:47.603
Maybe he just thinks
you're cute.

34:49.438 --> 34:50.687
I like your place.

34:51.395 --> 34:54.020
It's quirky, elegant.

34:54.937 --> 34:57.312
Yeah? Even without gifts
hanging from the ceilings

34:57.395 --> 34:59.312
and mermaid murals on the wall?

34:59.395 --> 35:00.937
I can arrange that.

35:01.020 --> 35:02.395
I know people.

35:04.227 --> 35:05.144
Do you want to sit?

35:05.227 --> 35:06.811
Yeah, just for a minute.

35:08.477 --> 35:10.811
I'm doing this reality TV show

35:10.894 --> 35:13.644
and these people show up
at the crack of dawn, so...

35:14.144 --> 35:15.186
Sounds like it sucks.

35:15.269 --> 35:16.269
Oh, it does...

35:17.311 --> 35:18.726
But there's this
hot producer lady

35:18.810 --> 35:20.685
who kind of makes it
all worthwhile.

35:38.475 --> 35:41.017
Stop! I can't.

35:41.434 --> 35:42.517
Okay.

35:42.934 --> 35:45.933
This is really bad.
It's really bad for the show.

35:46.349 --> 35:47.891
And for me professionally.

35:48.349 --> 35:49.349
Okay.

35:58.808 --> 35:59.808
No!

35:59.848 --> 36:01.223
I can't, I can't...

36:02.098 --> 36:04.015
What? You don't like
the way I kiss?

36:04.098 --> 36:06.932
I do. I like the way
you kiss too much.

36:07.015 --> 36:09.432
A lot. Which is why
you need to go.

36:09.932 --> 36:12.182
Thank you for the flowers
and the kiss.

36:12.265 --> 36:13.972
I will see you tomorrow.

36:14.472 --> 36:16.264
You are one disciplined girl.

36:16.347 --> 36:18.181
You will thank me later.

36:18.972 --> 36:21.264
Thank you. Goodbye, Will.

36:35.846 --> 36:42.095
[bouncy, upbeat music]

36:44.679 --> 36:48.887
[bouncy, upbeat music]

36:50.012 --> 36:51.012
Hey.

36:51.304 --> 36:52.970
- Hello.
- Hi.

36:53.470 --> 36:55.303
- Morning.
- Yeah.

37:06.844 --> 37:09.552
You sure I don't look silly
sitting in the middle like this?

37:10.260 --> 37:11.760
You look great, I promise.

37:12.677 --> 37:13.843
Okay, ready?

37:15.218 --> 37:19.010
So Will, you've been collecting
this train set your entire life.

37:19.093 --> 37:21.510
At what point did it become
a Christmas village?

37:22.052 --> 37:23.717
When my house became
holiday central,

37:23.801 --> 37:24.801
so did the trains.

37:24.884 --> 37:26.842
It keeps the kid
alive in me, too.

37:26.926 --> 37:27.926
Absolutely.

37:27.967 --> 37:30.467
The kids that come through
on our fundraising tours,

37:30.551 --> 37:32.092
this is their favorite stop.

37:32.259 --> 37:34.259
Fundraising?
Why don't you tell us

37:34.342 --> 37:36.023
a little about the charities
you work with?

37:36.092 --> 37:37.966
Well, the first and key charity
I work with

37:38.050 --> 37:39.383
is at the Union Hope Shelter.

37:39.466 --> 37:40.827
That's downtown
at Third and Lucas.

37:40.883 --> 37:42.133
Look at him go.

37:42.216 --> 37:43.550
I guess there is
some personality

37:43.633 --> 37:44.883
attached to those pecs.

37:45.091 --> 37:46.776
Oh, there's definitely more
to Christmas Dude

37:46.800 --> 37:48.175
than meets the eye.

37:48.258 --> 37:51.049
Just takes the right energy
to bring it out of him.

37:51.132 --> 37:52.191
Of course, on the other hand,

37:52.215 --> 37:53.816
we don't want him to
get too comfortable.

37:53.840 --> 37:55.465
Okay, great!

37:55.549 --> 37:57.465
Let's go over here
and get some more stuff.

37:57.549 --> 37:58.549
Okay.

38:07.048 --> 38:08.339
Okay, so...

38:08.423 --> 38:10.756
This room is really theatrical.

38:10.839 --> 38:13.589
It's almost "The Little Mermaid"
meets "A Christmas Story."

38:13.673 --> 38:15.923
Yeah, it was
really fun to design.

38:16.006 --> 38:18.713
It's got kind of a
feminine vibe to it

38:18.797 --> 38:20.838
for such a manly man
like yourself.

38:20.922 --> 38:21.963
Wouldn't you say, Will?

38:23.547 --> 38:26.422
Well, I just wanted a little
something for everyone.

38:27.088 --> 38:28.713
What exactly was
the inspiration?

38:29.755 --> 38:30.755
Truth?

38:31.672 --> 38:32.754
Always.

38:35.671 --> 38:38.837
I had this girlfriend,
and she loved mermaids.

38:38.921 --> 38:42.212
I think she thought she
was one in a past life.

38:42.296 --> 38:44.546
So the idea came from her.

38:45.671 --> 38:48.503
Some people think mermaids
are kind of sexy.

38:48.586 --> 38:52.378
Does this double as a fantasy
suite for you sometimes?

38:55.003 --> 38:57.545
Well, any room can feel special

38:57.628 --> 38:59.670
if you're in it with
the right person.

38:59.920 --> 39:01.294
Wouldn't you agree, Paul?

39:01.460 --> 39:03.044
Works for me.

39:03.460 --> 39:05.294
No further questions,
your honor.

39:09.627 --> 39:11.335
You gave it right back
to Paul in there.

39:11.877 --> 39:15.459
I got some good advice
from a smart producer I know.

39:15.918 --> 39:17.209
You should listen to her.

39:18.084 --> 39:19.709
So a mermaid girlfriend?

39:20.501 --> 39:23.084
It was ages ago...
water under the bridge.

39:23.293 --> 39:25.168
I just wanted to toss
your nosy boss a bone.

39:25.251 --> 39:26.084
Good job.

39:26.168 --> 39:27.918
Come on, I want to
show you something.

39:28.625 --> 39:32.375
Okay, so picture
all this stuff covering

39:32.458 --> 39:35.583
the entire front of the
house and you get the idea.

39:37.542 --> 39:39.708
Santa's workshop has
got nothing on you.

39:39.792 --> 39:41.625
Who do you think he calls
for reinforcements?

39:44.374 --> 39:45.624
Hey, I remember this.

39:46.041 --> 39:48.957
This was what you were working
on the day of our walkthrough.

39:49.041 --> 39:52.499
I was. It's a gingerbread house.

39:55.207 --> 39:56.498
My mom and dad bought it for me

39:56.581 --> 39:59.040
the Christmas before
they passed away.

40:00.498 --> 40:01.998
Your last year with them?

40:03.998 --> 40:04.998
It was.

40:07.831 --> 40:10.247
Anyway, my grandpa and I added

40:10.330 --> 40:13.122
a whole bunch of details
to it over the years.

40:14.080 --> 40:16.705
Maybe we can do something
special with it on camera?

40:18.955 --> 40:20.914
Absolutely we can.

40:45.037 --> 40:46.203
Sophia!

40:47.703 --> 40:49.620
Wait five minutes
and then come out.

40:50.703 --> 40:52.536
Yoohoo! Soph!

40:55.702 --> 40:57.327
That was... where were you?

40:57.411 --> 40:59.327
Checking out the millions
of Christmas things.

40:59.411 --> 41:00.619
Will had in the garage.

41:00.702 --> 41:02.202
You would not believe
all the things

41:02.286 --> 41:03.494
he has stashed away in there.

41:03.577 --> 41:04.702
Crazy!

41:04.786 --> 41:06.118
I cannot wait until
we get a shot

41:06.201 --> 41:08.576
of him decorating the
house. It's going to be insane.

41:08.660 --> 41:10.177
I really hope we scheduled
enough time for it.

41:10.201 --> 41:11.326
Did we schedule enough time?

41:11.410 --> 41:13.076
Why are you talking so fast?

41:13.160 --> 41:14.910
- Am I?
- Yeah. You are.

41:15.285 --> 41:19.284
It's just this really strong
coffee this morning.

41:19.367 --> 41:21.409
Yeah! No matter how
much sugar I put in it...

41:29.409 --> 41:33.408
In our next hour: this season's
hottest Christmas recipes.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.449
You're watching KTLA.

41:40.158 --> 41:42.158
Hey, Fred. Come to lend a hand?

41:42.241 --> 41:43.241
Not on your life.

41:43.616 --> 41:45.033
I better not see
any of these lights

41:45.116 --> 41:46.616
shining before
they're supposed to!

41:46.699 --> 41:47.615
You know what the
injunction says!

41:47.698 --> 41:49.657
The lights will be up, not on.

41:49.740 --> 41:51.615
It's just for some
quick filming.

41:52.365 --> 41:54.424
And can I give you a little
piece of neighborly advice?

41:54.448 --> 41:56.115
And what might that be?

41:56.198 --> 41:59.573
How about this Christmas,
I don't know.

41:59.657 --> 42:00.947
Enjoy yourself?

42:10.156 --> 42:13.239
I had it made for you
to wear on the show.

42:13.322 --> 42:14.762
Try it on and tell me
what you think.

42:14.821 --> 42:15.821
I love it!

42:22.613 --> 42:23.613
Oh!

42:28.779 --> 42:29.904
How's it look?

42:29.987 --> 42:31.195
Like a million bucks!

42:31.279 --> 42:32.654
I think it's amazing.

42:32.945 --> 42:34.987
Maybe we need to make it
a little tighter?

42:35.070 --> 42:36.154
Put it in the dryer?

42:36.820 --> 42:37.820
If you hot wash it,

42:37.904 --> 42:39.904
we can dry it on your abs,
you know what I mean?

42:40.404 --> 42:41.237
How are you today?

42:41.320 --> 42:42.920
- Doing well, how are you?
- Hi, I'm Paul.

42:42.944 --> 42:44.170
- Paul, nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.

42:44.194 --> 42:47.403
So, how do you feel about
Will's Christmas extravaganza?

42:47.819 --> 42:49.212
It's kind of crazy town
for my tastes.

42:49.236 --> 42:51.569
He can decoare my bush anytime.

42:52.944 --> 42:54.028
I can tell you one thing:

42:54.111 --> 42:56.568
I wouldn't want to pay
his light bill. No way!

42:56.985 --> 43:00.818
What do you think of Will's
majestic Christmas wonderland?

43:03.652 --> 43:05.152
I hate the whole thing.

43:06.360 --> 43:08.152
Oh, is that everything?

43:08.235 --> 43:09.943
Yeah, that just about covers it.

43:10.027 --> 43:12.192
Great, great. Did we get that?

43:12.567 --> 43:14.692
Great, can we try it
one more time with a smile?

43:14.776 --> 43:15.776
With a smile?

43:17.192 --> 43:19.067
I hate the whole thing.

43:48.315 --> 43:50.565
So, you happy?

43:51.690 --> 43:52.814
Not unhappy.

43:53.356 --> 43:55.189
Definite improvement.
I'll take it.

43:55.939 --> 43:57.356
Are you heading
back to the office?

43:57.439 --> 43:58.481
No. Home.

43:59.814 --> 44:00.814
Wanna stick around?

44:02.314 --> 44:03.356
Maybe.

44:03.439 --> 44:04.523
You've gotta eat, right?

44:04.856 --> 44:06.105
You cook, too?

44:06.522 --> 44:08.022
Oh yeah. I cook.

44:11.730 --> 44:13.938
No measuring cups or cookbooks.
I'm impressed.

44:14.897 --> 44:16.980
I just wing it.
Usually works out.

44:17.730 --> 44:19.812
Are you sure I can't help
with anything?

44:20.104 --> 44:21.104
I'm sure.

44:21.479 --> 44:23.062
All right, I'm on dishes then.

44:24.062 --> 44:25.271
Be my guest.

44:29.729 --> 44:32.687
So, other than the
mermaid wannabe,

44:32.771 --> 44:35.020
are there any other serious
relationships in your past?

44:35.603 --> 44:36.853
A few, for sure.

44:36.936 --> 44:38.770
I was actually engaged
in college.

44:38.853 --> 44:41.895
Really? Engaged.
That is serious.

44:42.311 --> 44:45.978
Yeah, but we were young and
it would've been a disaster.

44:46.103 --> 44:47.270
Hit and miss since then,

44:47.353 --> 44:50.144
and lately it's just been
me and Romeo.

44:51.977 --> 44:53.935
What about you? Anyone serious?

44:55.477 --> 44:58.810
Yeah, but no one I wanted
to go the distance with.

44:59.394 --> 45:01.310
The last relationship
was a disaster.

45:01.393 --> 45:03.059
He was a cheating mess.

45:03.893 --> 45:09.226
It kind of tainted relationships
and trust for me, so...

45:10.226 --> 45:11.643
Want me to kick his ass?

45:12.393 --> 45:14.393
No, he was not worth the energy.

45:21.183 --> 45:22.892
How did your parents die?

45:24.850 --> 45:26.475
Sorry, was that
way too personal?

45:26.558 --> 45:27.784
You don't have to
answer that question.

45:27.808 --> 45:29.432
No. It's fine.

45:31.141 --> 45:34.432
It was a car accident.
Drunk driver.

45:35.891 --> 45:36.891
Sorry.

45:37.641 --> 45:38.891
How old were you?

45:39.099 --> 45:40.099
Eight.

45:41.224 --> 45:42.682
Do you have any siblings?

45:43.515 --> 45:44.515
Just me.

45:44.806 --> 45:46.015
Any other family?

45:47.056 --> 45:48.056
No.

45:49.806 --> 45:50.931
That's sad.

45:54.723 --> 45:56.598
What I've experienced
in my life,

45:57.055 --> 45:59.889
it's all relative to what
you've experienced,

45:59.972 --> 46:01.639
what Hank has experienced.

46:02.472 --> 46:03.823
The kids from the
charities I work with,

46:03.847 --> 46:05.555
what they're experiencing.

46:06.389 --> 46:07.639
We only know what we know,

46:08.014 --> 46:10.264
if we have nothing else
to compare it to.

46:10.888 --> 46:13.013
Yeah, I suppose so.

46:14.388 --> 46:16.197
My grandparents swooped me up,
moved me in here,

46:16.221 --> 46:17.721
and raised me like champs.

46:18.971 --> 46:21.054
I was always loved,
that's for sure.

46:21.888 --> 46:24.304
Even though I was a pretty
challenging teenager.

46:24.513 --> 46:25.803
Challenging how?

46:25.887 --> 46:27.345
Fell in with a bad crowd.

46:27.553 --> 46:29.012
Drugs, booze...

46:29.095 --> 46:29.928
Really?

46:30.012 --> 46:31.095
Oh yeah.

46:32.220 --> 46:33.262
I was a shithead.

46:34.428 --> 46:35.887
I even broke into a house once.

46:36.345 --> 46:38.969
I hit rock bottom when
I was in my late teens.

46:39.552 --> 46:41.219
Grandparents kicked me out.

46:41.302 --> 46:43.427
Went from one
friend's couch to the next.

46:44.261 --> 46:46.136
Spent a few nights
on the street.

46:47.511 --> 46:50.677
Long story short: it was
definitely an eye opener.

46:51.302 --> 46:53.218
I was lucky my grandparents
took me back.

46:53.301 --> 46:54.301
Yeah.

46:55.926 --> 46:58.926
Worst I ever did was get
a week's detention.

46:59.426 --> 47:01.385
And I swear, it wasn't my fault!

47:01.468 --> 47:02.801
I'm sure it wasn't.

47:05.593 --> 47:06.593
[oven beeps]

47:11.092 --> 47:13.967
You were lucky to have them -
your grandparents.

47:14.050 --> 47:15.550
I honestly don't know where

47:15.634 --> 47:17.467
I would have ended up
without them.

47:17.675 --> 47:20.841
So I try to help others
the way they helped me.

47:20.924 --> 47:22.341
Pay it forward, you know?

47:22.799 --> 47:26.008
And keeping the meaning
of Christmas alive every day

47:26.091 --> 47:27.424
just ties it all together.

47:28.424 --> 47:29.674
That's beautiful, Will.

47:32.091 --> 47:34.173
I wonder what your
grandparents would think

47:34.257 --> 47:36.090
about everything
that's going on here now?

47:36.173 --> 47:38.007
Are you kidding? They'd love it.

47:38.090 --> 47:40.507
They were the happiest,
chattiest pair you've ever seen.

47:42.423 --> 47:43.548
How about your parents?

47:44.090 --> 47:46.548
Not the happiest, chattiest
pair you've ever met.

47:47.382 --> 47:50.006
They were divorced when I was
in third grade, so...

47:52.339 --> 47:54.131
Will, I have a confession
to make.

47:54.714 --> 47:56.297
Should I be sitting down?

47:56.714 --> 47:57.922
No, it's just...

48:00.089 --> 48:03.130
I am not cuckoo for Christmas.

48:03.671 --> 48:06.130
I just said it so you
would do the show

48:06.213 --> 48:08.255
and so that you'd like me.

48:09.380 --> 48:10.963
I have something
to confess, too.

48:13.046 --> 48:14.130
I already knew.

48:14.921 --> 48:15.921
Any true Christmas nut

48:15.962 --> 48:17.938
could've immediately named
their favorite ornament maker.

48:17.962 --> 48:19.504
You went generic.

48:19.587 --> 48:20.837
But it's okay, really.

48:20.920 --> 48:22.754
I won't hold it against you.

48:22.837 --> 48:23.920
Well, thank you.

48:24.004 --> 48:26.712
Although I'm not sure
that I deserve that.

48:29.420 --> 48:30.420
My parents.

48:32.253 --> 48:36.211
Every year they would argue over
who got me at Christmas time.

48:37.753 --> 48:39.086
It was a big competition:

48:39.169 --> 48:43.960
who had the bigger house,
better gifts, fancier vacation,

48:44.043 --> 48:46.752
and it made me dread
Christmas every year.

48:46.835 --> 48:48.127
I still do.

48:49.877 --> 48:51.793
Maybe this year
will be different.

48:53.960 --> 48:55.252
Maybe it will.

51:22.949 --> 51:24.699
Who knew he'd look
so good on a ladder?

51:24.782 --> 51:26.423
Wait! We shouldn't
be letting him do that!

51:26.449 --> 51:28.092
Yeah, it's not really
the best time for our star

51:28.116 --> 51:29.324
to end up in a full body cast.

51:29.407 --> 51:31.531
This is going to be gold.
It'll cut together great!

51:31.615 --> 51:34.865
Plus we are insured up
the wazoo, so...

51:36.865 --> 51:38.323
He's smiley today.

51:38.573 --> 51:40.823
Maybe our boy got
a little lucky last night.

51:40.906 --> 51:42.031
Why do you say that?

51:42.448 --> 51:44.739
That glow, it ain't from
the Christmas lights.

51:44.822 --> 51:47.489
I'll tell you one thing:
he loves that t-shirt.

51:47.572 --> 51:49.239
And we love him in it.

51:50.280 --> 51:51.322
Nice job, Sophia.

51:51.405 --> 51:53.155
[gasping]

51:54.864 --> 51:56.405
How's that? Did you
get what you want?

51:57.739 --> 51:58.571
That was scary.

51:58.654 --> 52:01.613
That was hilarious, and our
cameras caught every second.

52:01.696 --> 52:03.738
Great job, Will,
that was perfect!

52:03.821 --> 52:05.113
He could've killed himself!

52:05.196 --> 52:08.988
Sophia, come on! We need a
little excitement, some action.

52:09.071 --> 52:10.321
Yeah, that you can manipulate.

52:11.071 --> 52:12.362
Don't try this at home, kids.

52:12.862 --> 52:13.903
Will, let's go again.

52:16.362 --> 52:18.237
What is it? What is wrong?

52:18.653 --> 52:20.028
You know what?
I don't trust Paul.

52:20.112 --> 52:22.237
I understand that we're
making television here,

52:22.320 --> 52:24.153
but there are
real lives at stake.

52:24.237 --> 52:27.569
Okay, I'm just gonna
take a stab here:

52:27.777 --> 52:31.861
this isn't about Paul, is it?
It's about you and Will.

52:32.777 --> 52:34.111
What about me and Will?

52:34.527 --> 52:35.527
I asked you first.

52:37.652 --> 52:39.569
Oh my god, you slept with him!

52:39.652 --> 52:40.652
Shhh!

52:40.693 --> 52:42.068
Why didn't you say something?

52:42.318 --> 52:45.151
This is... fantastic!

52:45.693 --> 52:47.235
When was it? How was it?

52:47.318 --> 52:49.568
It was last night and
it was off the charts.

52:50.068 --> 52:52.943
I'm in it really
deep here, Linz.

52:53.026 --> 52:54.067
Okay yeah, I mean,

52:54.150 --> 52:56.067
maybe this isn't the beset
career move for you

52:56.150 --> 53:00.109
at this very second, but you'd
have to be made of cement

53:00.192 --> 53:01.775
not to respond to Will.

53:02.275 --> 53:03.859
That doesn't make it right.

53:04.734 --> 53:07.400
Look, you deserve to be happy.

53:07.483 --> 53:11.024
Just be careful, don't
let it affect the work.

53:11.108 --> 53:13.899
And... enjoy the shit out of it.

53:15.858 --> 53:16.858
Not a peep!

53:17.316 --> 53:18.399
You got it, sister.

53:23.732 --> 53:25.190
Give us the countdown, man.

53:25.273 --> 53:27.023
Three, two, one...

53:28.107 --> 53:29.398
Merry Christmas!

53:55.021 --> 53:56.021
Hey!

53:56.688 --> 53:58.563
Leaving without a goodbye?

53:59.021 --> 54:00.521
Goodbyes with you
get me in trouble.

54:01.730 --> 54:02.771
You won't stay?

54:03.895 --> 54:05.437
I can't stay.

54:06.854 --> 54:07.854
I understand.

54:10.395 --> 54:11.979
I was thinking, if you want,

54:12.062 --> 54:14.263
I could help you pick out a
Christmas tree this weekend.

54:15.479 --> 54:16.562
Like a date?

54:17.519 --> 54:18.644
Call it work.

54:20.353 --> 54:21.353
Alright.

54:21.728 --> 54:23.620
My grandpa and I used to
go out after Thanksgiving

54:23.644 --> 54:25.394
and chop down our own tree.

54:25.478 --> 54:27.120
My biggest thrill was
when I was old enough

54:27.144 --> 54:28.686
to do the chopping myself.

54:28.769 --> 54:30.852
Just a boy and his axe.

54:30.935 --> 54:32.268
Until I discovered girls.

54:32.768 --> 54:33.768
Lucky us.

54:35.352 --> 54:37.685
So, how do I know
which one to pick?

54:38.102 --> 54:39.518
Which looks best to you?

54:41.102 --> 54:42.560
I kind of like that one.

54:43.352 --> 54:45.934
Noble fir.
Good, traditional choice.

54:46.726 --> 54:47.726
How tall?

54:50.309 --> 54:52.392
About your height's perfect.

54:52.976 --> 54:54.059
You like the shape?

54:54.142 --> 54:56.267
Oh, yeah. So symmetrical.

54:57.184 --> 54:59.308
Okay, now you have
to check the branches

54:59.391 --> 55:00.826
and make sure they're
soft and pliable

55:00.850 --> 55:02.433
and not brittle in any way.

55:02.641 --> 55:05.016
There's nothing brittle
about this one.

55:12.807 --> 55:15.099
Do you always travel
with 100 spare ornaments?

55:15.515 --> 55:17.349
I just figured,
given your humbug history,

55:17.432 --> 55:19.433
you'd be a little light
in the ornament department.

55:20.057 --> 55:22.015
You figured right.
Thank you.

55:24.765 --> 55:26.389
I grabbed one of my favorites.

55:28.389 --> 55:29.764
A movie theater!

55:29.848 --> 55:32.431
This reminds me of
It's a Wonderful Life.

55:33.014 --> 55:34.348
My favorite Christmas movie.

55:34.431 --> 55:36.056
So she does like Christmas!

55:36.139 --> 55:38.514
I never said I didn't
like Christmas.

55:38.598 --> 55:39.848
Just aspects of it.

55:40.805 --> 55:42.680
Pick a place of honor
for the movie house.

55:51.097 --> 55:52.097
Perfect.

55:55.762 --> 55:56.762
Come here.

56:06.179 --> 56:07.262
I'm falling, Sophia.

56:09.845 --> 56:11.261
I'm falling for you.

56:35.385 --> 56:38.259
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

56:39.468 --> 56:41.759
Has anyone ever told you
how beautiful you are?

56:42.843 --> 56:45.384
Can't say anyone has told me
I'm beautiful before.

56:45.676 --> 56:46.676
No.

56:50.133 --> 56:52.925
Romeo - is Romeo home alone?

56:53.008 --> 56:54.258
He's with Hank.

56:54.342 --> 56:57.092
Can I say that I love that
you think about my dog?

56:57.175 --> 57:01.217
I think about you.
And how lucky I am.

57:01.717 --> 57:02.842
That you found me?

57:03.841 --> 57:05.424
Well, technically
Paul found you.

57:05.507 --> 57:07.757
I just... followed up.

57:08.716 --> 57:09.799
Remind me to thank him.

57:10.841 --> 57:12.674
How about after the show airs,
okay?

57:12.966 --> 57:13.966
Got it.

57:15.799 --> 57:18.798
Hey, wanna maybe go for a hike
or something this morning?

57:19.006 --> 57:21.423
I can grab Romeo,
we can hit up Griffith Park?

57:22.715 --> 57:25.423
I'm still thinking low profile
is the way to go.

57:27.090 --> 57:28.590
Or we could just stay in...

57:29.840 --> 57:32.047
That could definitely have
its definite advantages.

57:36.880 --> 57:39.922
And here we have Frosty,
and his little brother, Norman.

57:41.880 --> 57:44.214
Frosty is a more appropriate
Christmas name,

57:44.297 --> 57:47.129
but Norman's
still... he's nice.

57:47.588 --> 57:49.546
Here you go, hold
these edges down.

57:57.254 --> 57:59.878
Our man's certainly got
charisma, no question.

57:59.962 --> 58:01.295
Once we opened him up.

58:01.378 --> 58:02.628
Or should I say once you did.

58:04.420 --> 58:07.503
Me, you, the crew... teamwork!

58:07.837 --> 58:08.837
Mmm-hmm.

58:10.503 --> 58:13.877
We still need some more
drama, conflict.

58:14.252 --> 58:15.252
Chaos.

58:15.294 --> 58:16.294
Chaos?

58:16.377 --> 58:17.658
We have one more day
of shooting.

58:17.711 --> 58:18.627
See what you can get.

58:18.711 --> 58:20.961
I don't want it to have
to be manufactured.

58:21.044 --> 58:23.502
Like this... snow.

58:24.002 --> 58:26.252
Everything you see here
has a history,

58:26.336 --> 58:27.543
a meaning, a purpose.

58:28.126 --> 58:30.167
So how long have you been
collecting all this stuff?

58:30.626 --> 58:33.126
I'm 33 years old so... 33 years.

58:33.793 --> 58:34.876
Since you were a baby?

58:34.960 --> 58:36.585
Well, maybe not that far back.

58:36.668 --> 58:38.751
But my first words were,
"Santa Claus."

58:40.001 --> 58:42.001
Why don't you tell us about
this gingerbread house?

58:42.334 --> 58:44.709
My parents gave me this
incredible gingerbread house

58:44.792 --> 58:46.459
for Christmas when I was a kid.

58:46.542 --> 58:48.560
I was too young then to know
how to put it together,

58:48.584 --> 58:50.709
so my dad and grandpa
showed me how.

58:51.209 --> 58:53.917
And every Christmas since,
I've assembled it.

58:54.584 --> 58:56.458
Last few years,
Hank has lent me a hand.

58:57.583 --> 58:58.583
Push in a little bit.

58:59.291 --> 59:00.767
Kayla, your boom
is in the shot again.

59:00.791 --> 59:02.249
-I'm not in the shot!

59:02.708 --> 59:03.916
I'm looking through the frame!

59:03.999 --> 59:05.666
Kayla, just back up.

59:06.041 --> 59:09.123
Well, I can't really back up...

59:10.082 --> 59:11.582
Kayla, just put your boom up.

59:11.665 --> 59:13.066
Okay, I guess I'm getting
up then...

59:13.623 --> 59:15.165
[crashing]

59:25.456 --> 59:27.872
Okay... no worries,
it's all good.

59:29.206 --> 59:31.247
No one got hurt.
The house can be fixed.

59:31.331 --> 59:32.247
Kayla, are you okay?

59:32.331 --> 59:35.456
Yeah, I'm fine.
It's just, the house...

59:36.538 --> 59:37.538
It's fine.

59:41.246 --> 59:42.246
Cut.

59:54.787 --> 59:55.787
Is everything okay?

59:56.329 --> 59:57.329
Yup.

59:59.245 --> 01:00:00.454
How's the house?

01:00:01.745 --> 01:00:02.745
Getting fixed.

01:00:05.161 --> 01:00:08.036
Kayla feels so bad. We all do.

01:00:08.828 --> 01:00:10.411
If I wouldn't have told her
to back up,

01:00:10.494 --> 01:00:12.036
none of this would
have happened.

01:00:12.119 --> 01:00:13.369
I'm so, so sorry.

01:00:14.578 --> 01:00:15.786
Sorry about what?

01:00:15.869 --> 01:00:17.786
I just told you: your house.

01:00:18.868 --> 01:00:20.743
How about being sorry
you kept rolling?

01:00:22.618 --> 01:00:23.844
Why didn't you stop the filming

01:00:23.868 --> 01:00:25.535
the second you saw
what happened?

01:00:31.285 --> 01:00:33.117
Listen, I gotta fix this.

01:00:33.284 --> 01:00:34.742
I'll see you inside.

01:00:55.366 --> 01:00:56.741
So, do you need a ride home?

01:00:56.825 --> 01:00:58.450
Don't you live in the
opposite direction?

01:00:58.533 --> 01:01:00.449
Yeah, but I can give you
a ride there

01:01:00.532 --> 01:01:01.907
if you need one, obviously.

01:01:02.907 --> 01:01:05.032
I guess I can put up
with you for a little longer.

01:01:09.574 --> 01:01:10.865
He's in the garage.

01:01:10.949 --> 01:01:12.383
I should have stopped
rolling immediately.

01:01:12.407 --> 01:01:13.466
That's not what Paul would say.

01:01:13.490 --> 01:01:16.114
Yeah, well Paul isn't secretly
involved with our lead.

01:01:16.239 --> 01:01:17.239
[text message alert]

01:01:20.739 --> 01:01:22.573
- Shit.
- What?

01:01:23.823 --> 01:01:24.906
Oh my God.

01:01:27.572 --> 01:01:29.447
That's good,
but that's not good.

01:01:29.530 --> 01:01:30.863
That's bad for the show.

01:01:33.738 --> 01:01:35.006
Who you're with is
really none of his

01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:35.905
or anyone else's business.

01:01:35.988 --> 01:01:38.030
That's just it,
it is his business.

01:01:39.030 --> 01:01:40.280
And it just looks bad.

01:01:42.196 --> 01:01:43.946
I mean, I know it wasn't exactly

01:01:44.029 --> 01:01:46.446
the smartest choice to make,
but...

01:01:48.112 --> 01:01:49.112
I made a choice.

01:01:49.821 --> 01:01:50.946
Are you sorry you did?

01:01:51.862 --> 01:01:52.904
No.

01:01:53.612 --> 01:01:55.361
Are you sorry you decided
to do the show?

01:01:56.486 --> 01:01:57.486
A little.

01:01:58.611 --> 01:02:00.486
But then I wouldn't
have met you...

01:02:01.361 --> 01:02:03.528
Unless of course
we're breaking up?

01:02:04.236 --> 01:02:07.986
No. I'm an excellent
multi-tasker.

01:02:08.445 --> 01:02:09.445
You are.

01:02:11.610 --> 01:02:13.235
But I have a show to produce.

01:02:13.652 --> 01:02:16.944
I have to stay focused,
there is a lot riding on it.

01:02:17.027 --> 01:02:18.485
Like my career.

01:02:20.027 --> 01:02:21.194
Sophia Worthy...

01:02:23.276 --> 01:02:26.068
You are one of the
most determined, capable,

01:02:26.151 --> 01:02:28.234
inspiring people
I've ever known.

01:02:29.318 --> 01:02:31.526
You can do it all. I know it.

01:02:32.984 --> 01:02:35.484
That's one of the sweetest
things anyone's ever said to me.

01:02:36.983 --> 01:02:39.067
I knew I liked you for a reason.

01:02:43.817 --> 01:02:46.442
I'm sorry I got so intense
about the gingerbread house.

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:49.483
It meant a lot to you.

01:02:51.649 --> 01:02:52.941
It's a big part of your past.

01:02:53.024 --> 01:02:56.107
Yeah, but it's a decoration.

01:02:57.232 --> 01:02:58.691
You were just doing your job.

01:02:59.357 --> 01:03:00.732
I should have stopped rolling.

01:03:01.482 --> 01:03:03.066
And I knew the history
of the house,

01:03:03.149 --> 01:03:04.191
and if it's broken...

01:03:04.274 --> 01:03:05.274
I'll fix it.

01:03:06.273 --> 01:03:07.440
That's what I do.

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:24.522
[Paul] There you are.

01:03:24.605 --> 01:03:26.189
I want you to call
to this person.

01:03:27.397 --> 01:03:28.480
Who's Helena Miller?

01:03:28.564 --> 01:03:29.689
She's a shrink. She's great.

01:03:31.564 --> 01:03:34.229
Paul, I know I've got issues,
but I don't need a shrink.

01:03:34.313 --> 01:03:36.438
Not for you, for the show.

01:03:36.521 --> 01:03:39.229
She's great. I want you
to set up a sitdown with her.

01:03:39.313 --> 01:03:41.634
Get her to talk about Christmas,
how it messes with people,

01:03:41.688 --> 01:03:44.313
gets in their head,
makes them go nuts.

01:03:44.396 --> 01:03:45.997
And by people, I'm
assuming you mean Will?

01:03:46.021 --> 01:03:47.978
Sophia, we still need
more dimension.

01:03:48.395 --> 01:03:49.996
Unless you're scared you're
going to find out something

01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:51.062
you don't want to know.

01:03:53.437 --> 01:03:55.437
I call the holidays
my tax season.

01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:56.520
It's my busiest time.

01:03:56.853 --> 01:03:57.853
Why is that?

01:03:57.937 --> 01:03:58.954
Why do you think the holidays

01:03:58.978 --> 01:04:00.852
are such a difficult time
for people?

01:04:01.102 --> 01:04:05.686
Christmas time is kind of
a perfect emotional storm.

01:04:05.769 --> 01:04:08.602
Another year is gone.
What have I accomplished?

01:04:08.686 --> 01:04:10.227
Who do I have to celebrate with?

01:04:10.311 --> 01:04:12.727
Why does everybody
seem so happy but me?

01:04:13.186 --> 01:04:15.976
And then there are the childhood
triggers that pop up.

01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:17.685
They can really derail you.

01:04:18.435 --> 01:04:19.435
Of course.

01:04:20.726 --> 01:04:22.893
So for example,
say if someone wanted

01:04:22.976 --> 01:04:26.185
to celebrate Christmas
every day of the year.

01:04:26.810 --> 01:04:28.610
What do you think is
the deeper meaning there?

01:04:29.225 --> 01:04:32.350
Two words: disfunction junction.

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:37.434
Thank you. Done.

01:04:37.850 --> 01:04:39.142
That was great.

01:04:42.099 --> 01:04:43.933
Sophia, this is so wrong.

01:04:45.016 --> 01:04:46.766
I know, it wasn't my idea.

01:04:48.099 --> 01:04:50.016
[Will] How is the show
looking so far?

01:04:50.099 --> 01:04:52.183
We have a lot of great footage.

01:04:52.266 --> 01:04:54.433
You are looking like
a major star.

01:04:54.724 --> 01:04:58.432
Everyone loves Christmas,
so what can go wrong?

01:04:58.890 --> 01:05:00.057
Even I'm getting into it.

01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:00.973
Yeah?

01:05:01.057 --> 01:05:02.057
[text message alert]

01:05:05.723 --> 01:05:06.973
Anything important?

01:05:07.057 --> 01:05:09.515
My buddy CJ saw a promo
for the show.

01:05:09.598 --> 01:05:10.598
He texted it to me.

01:05:10.639 --> 01:05:11.889
A promo?

01:05:11.972 --> 01:05:13.639
You're kidding, I
didn't know we had one.

01:05:14.514 --> 01:05:17.347
Wait... maybe I
should watch it first?

01:05:18.097 --> 01:05:19.764
Why? Are you
afraid of something?

01:05:21.514 --> 01:05:22.681
No, I just...

01:05:23.930 --> 01:05:25.888
Okay fine, let's watch it.

01:05:27.096 --> 01:05:30.263
Buckle up this Christmas as
Bravada Television presents.

01:05:30.346 --> 01:05:34.305
"Extreme Holidays" with an eye-
opening look at one sexy stud

01:05:34.388 --> 01:05:38.220
who celebrates yuletide 365
crazy days a year!"

01:05:39.179 --> 01:05:40.804
Hi, I'm Will Saunders

01:05:40.887 --> 01:05:43.387
and welcome to my
Christmas wonderland!

01:05:49.054 --> 01:05:50.845
It's kind of crazy town
for my tastes.

01:05:50.929 --> 01:05:52.809
But my kids love it, so
what're you gonna do?

01:05:52.844 --> 01:05:54.428
I wouldn't want to pay
his light bill.

01:05:54.928 --> 01:05:56.303
I hate the whole thing.

01:05:56.761 --> 01:05:59.428
Uh...

01:06:00.094 --> 01:06:01.344
It's snowing!

01:06:02.928 --> 01:06:06.010
Two words: disfunction junction.

01:06:06.093 --> 01:06:09.135
You've never seen a guy so
hopelessly devoted in your life!

01:06:09.218 --> 01:06:11.177
Catch the series premier,
Christmas Eve!

01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:13.052
I don't know, maybe I'm nuts...

01:06:13.135 --> 01:06:14.385
Can I do that again?

01:06:16.593 --> 01:06:17.593
What the hell was that?

01:06:18.510 --> 01:06:19.510
So you knew about this?

01:06:20.051 --> 01:06:21.443
Well, I knew they
were cutting promos.

01:06:21.467 --> 01:06:22.610
I didn't know when
they were airing.

01:06:22.634 --> 01:06:23.551
Well, they have to pull it.

01:06:23.634 --> 01:06:24.634
That's not happening.

01:06:24.676 --> 01:06:25.676
It has to!

01:06:25.717 --> 01:06:26.985
Not only does it
misrepresent Will,

01:06:27.009 --> 01:06:28.301
but it misrepresents the show!

01:06:28.384 --> 01:06:30.134
Okay Sophia, calm down!

01:06:30.217 --> 01:06:31.426
[groans]

01:06:32.176 --> 01:06:34.466
The network got ahold of me
late last night.

01:06:35.591 --> 01:06:38.091
The new promos
tested through the roof.

01:06:38.175 --> 01:06:40.716
The network immediately
slapped them online, on air...

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:41.942
But it's not the show
we're making!

01:06:41.966 --> 01:06:43.466
Well I hate to tell you,
but it is.

01:06:43.550 --> 01:06:44.831
At least it's the tone
they want.

01:06:44.883 --> 01:06:45.800
What about what we want?

01:06:45.883 --> 01:06:47.965
We want our deal renewed.

01:06:49.632 --> 01:06:51.215
What if I disagree?

01:06:51.299 --> 01:06:53.924
Well, you could quit

01:06:54.007 --> 01:06:57.299
and have absolutely no say
in the direction we take.

01:06:57.382 --> 01:07:00.674
Or you can stay and cut
a great show.

01:07:00.756 --> 01:07:02.964
One that Bravada will
really, really love.

01:07:03.339 --> 01:07:04.482
So you're letting them
make me look

01:07:04.506 --> 01:07:06.631
like a complete idiot
on national TV.

01:07:07.089 --> 01:07:09.131
The one thing I was
worried about from the start.

01:07:11.589 --> 01:07:13.756
I'm going to be there
every step of the way

01:07:13.839 --> 01:07:15.547
and make sure that
the show looks

01:07:15.630 --> 01:07:17.338
as good as it possibly can.

01:07:18.463 --> 01:07:19.838
Within my power.

01:07:19.922 --> 01:07:21.380
This was such a mistake.

01:07:22.172 --> 01:07:23.755
I never should have said yes.

01:07:24.755 --> 01:07:26.213
Why did you then?

01:07:28.213 --> 01:07:29.213
The truth?

01:07:30.754 --> 01:07:31.754
Because of you.

01:07:33.837 --> 01:07:36.671
I believed you saw something
in me that maybe I didn't.

01:07:37.504 --> 01:07:39.796
So when you told me
to trust you, I did.

01:07:43.503 --> 01:07:45.128
I also feel kind of used.

01:07:47.586 --> 01:07:50.420
Used? By who?

01:07:50.961 --> 01:07:52.795
By Paul. And by you.

01:07:54.211 --> 01:07:57.294
I know how you feel - I do.

01:07:59.502 --> 01:08:01.127
I was blindsided too.

01:08:05.502 --> 01:08:08.085
I really don't want this
to come between us.

01:08:10.044 --> 01:08:11.418
It already has.

01:08:22.709 --> 01:08:23.709
There you go.

01:08:24.125 --> 01:08:25.832
I knew it was too good
to be true.

01:08:27.417 --> 01:08:29.625
You can't be that
surprised by it.

01:08:30.582 --> 01:08:31.582
I can't?

01:08:32.417 --> 01:08:34.707
He was a little prickly.

01:08:35.542 --> 01:08:36.792
Very much his own man,

01:08:36.875 --> 01:08:39.166
which is not necessarily
a bad thing,

01:08:39.249 --> 01:08:41.166
but there were some red flags

01:08:41.249 --> 01:08:43.249
flying amid that
first-rate hunkiness.

01:08:43.332 --> 01:08:44.957
There were? What red flags?

01:08:45.041 --> 01:08:47.791
Well, he's Christmas crazy.
That's unusual.

01:08:47.874 --> 01:08:50.332
He's creative and nostalgic.

01:08:50.666 --> 01:08:52.497
Not crazy, don't call him that.

01:08:52.581 --> 01:08:53.622
You know what I mean.

01:08:54.497 --> 01:08:55.415
I don't know, Linz.

01:08:55.497 --> 01:08:57.290
He's honestly
all-around perfect.

01:08:58.706 --> 01:09:01.706
It's just your judgment got
a little clouded, that's all.

01:09:02.831 --> 01:09:05.040
I have never felt this way.
Ever.

01:09:05.997 --> 01:09:08.788
Guys like Will don't
come around every day.

01:09:08.872 --> 01:09:11.580
Good thing, because how could
we keep up with them all?

01:09:14.997 --> 01:09:17.580
Will told me that he thought
that I saw things in him

01:09:17.663 --> 01:09:19.497
that he hadn't seen in himself.

01:09:20.787 --> 01:09:22.953
Honestly, it was
the other way around.

01:09:23.703 --> 01:09:25.662
And I was starting
to love him for it.

01:09:27.453 --> 01:09:28.828
At least I thought I was.

01:09:30.871 --> 01:09:32.121
Men...

01:09:33.078 --> 01:09:34.120
Men.

01:10:18.450 --> 01:10:19.825
Set it down over there.

01:10:21.242 --> 01:10:23.117
Still haven't fixed that yet?

01:10:23.742 --> 01:10:24.742
Roof's busted.

01:10:25.659 --> 01:10:28.117
Long as I've known you, Will,
you've never been a quitter.

01:10:29.533 --> 01:10:31.824
Some things are just
broken beyond repair.

01:10:33.449 --> 01:10:35.574
You talking about the house,
or Sophia?

01:10:36.449 --> 01:10:38.824
What are we if we can't be
trusted to do the right thing?

01:10:39.949 --> 01:10:41.783
People make mistakes, Will.

01:10:41.866 --> 01:10:44.740
It doesn't mean they can't learn
from them, can't change.

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:46.591
Yvette and I might
still be together

01:10:46.615 --> 01:10:48.698
if I had just made
some different choices.

01:10:49.282 --> 01:10:51.615
I might know my kids,
my grand kids.

01:10:52.448 --> 01:10:54.032
Just don't be like me, Will.

01:10:54.448 --> 01:10:55.573
Don't have regrets.

01:10:58.197 --> 01:11:01.406
Come on - let's fix this old
gingerbread house already.

01:11:06.072 --> 01:11:09.239
You know what?
Just give me a sec.

01:11:18.738 --> 01:11:19.780
Need some help?

01:11:22.071 --> 01:11:23.405
Damn gophers...

01:11:24.321 --> 01:11:27.112
One of these days they're going
to eat the whole damn mailbox.

01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:29.570
Maybe you could get an
injunction against them?

01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:39.653
Really is quite the deal
you put on there.

01:11:40.736 --> 01:11:42.694
I don't think I quite
realized that

01:11:42.778 --> 01:11:44.444
until that whole TV show
came along.

01:11:45.819 --> 01:11:47.611
Gotta love those cameras, right?

01:11:48.944 --> 01:11:50.069
I, uh...

01:11:51.278 --> 01:11:52.818
I gave them an interview,
you know.

01:11:53.235 --> 01:11:56.152
I saw. Nice work, very quotable.

01:11:58.693 --> 01:12:01.485
Ginny always talked about
how great it was on the inside.

01:12:02.902 --> 01:12:05.943
I've been missing her a lot
this last little while.

01:12:09.401 --> 01:12:10.817
Feel like a quick tour?

01:12:11.567 --> 01:12:13.484
Yeah, I'd like that.

01:12:16.109 --> 01:12:17.609
Don't worry, it will stay there.

01:12:19.317 --> 01:12:22.525
I don't always succeed,
but that's what I try to do.

01:12:24.733 --> 01:12:26.233
So, how's it going?

01:12:27.233 --> 01:12:30.358
Good, just trying to decide
what to use from this clip.

01:12:30.816 --> 01:12:34.607
Oh, is this when he waxes poetic
about peace on earth

01:12:34.690 --> 01:12:37.107
and good will hunting,
or whatever?

01:12:37.190 --> 01:12:39.315
Can we please use as little
of this as possible?

01:12:39.774 --> 01:12:43.149
Yeah, it's only his entire
philosophy and reason for being.

01:12:44.399 --> 01:12:46.565
I get it: laughs, gaffes,
and thrills.

01:12:46.649 --> 01:12:47.690
I'm on it, Paul.

01:12:49.356 --> 01:12:52.648
Look, I know I've been
hard on you.

01:12:53.523 --> 01:12:56.648
But it's because I really
want you to succeed.

01:12:57.189 --> 01:13:00.564
You have real ability, and
I want everyone to see it.

01:13:01.773 --> 01:13:02.773
Okay?

01:13:05.063 --> 01:13:08.105
So, you going to bring Superman
to the Christmas party?

01:13:09.272 --> 01:13:11.022
That would be a little hard
right now.

01:13:11.105 --> 01:13:12.647
We're not exactly speaking.

01:13:13.230 --> 01:13:14.230
Oh.

01:13:15.313 --> 01:13:16.604
Is that because of the show?

01:13:17.354 --> 01:13:22.021
The show. Expectations.
Trust issues.

01:13:22.229 --> 01:13:24.937
And don't date the talent:
you were right.

01:13:25.896 --> 01:13:28.771
Well, I had to learn
that one the hard way.

01:13:28.854 --> 01:13:31.020
But then I married the guy,
so...

01:13:31.436 --> 01:13:33.103
It's not always a trainwreck.

01:13:38.103 --> 01:13:40.395
[hammering]

01:15:47.552 --> 01:15:48.593
- Sophia...
- Will!

01:15:49.801 --> 01:15:51.176
I was just...

01:15:51.843 --> 01:15:53.093
getting a latte.

01:15:54.301 --> 01:15:57.635
Medium nonfat, half-caf,
no foam...

01:15:59.093 --> 01:16:00.176
teaspoon of agave.

01:16:02.051 --> 01:16:03.134
Good memory.

01:16:04.384 --> 01:16:06.134
- So how've you been?
- How've you been?

01:16:07.134 --> 01:16:08.342
How's Romeo?

01:16:10.009 --> 01:16:11.134
Excited to see you.

01:16:11.884 --> 01:16:13.009
Yeah, I miss him too.

01:16:17.258 --> 01:16:20.133
The show is looking really good.

01:16:22.633 --> 01:16:25.716
Paul was asking me if you
would do publicity for it,

01:16:25.799 --> 01:16:27.883
but I assumed it was a fat "no."

01:16:28.633 --> 01:16:30.340
Whatever the opposite
of publicity is,

01:16:30.423 --> 01:16:32.882
that's what I'll be doing.

01:16:38.632 --> 01:16:41.465
I fixed the gingerbread house.
Looks almost good as new.

01:16:43.715 --> 01:16:44.839
That's really good.

01:16:48.922 --> 01:16:49.922
Well...

01:16:57.256 --> 01:16:58.546
Merry Christmas, Sophia.

01:17:01.171 --> 01:17:02.338
You too, Will.

01:17:04.588 --> 01:17:05.671
Bye Romeo.

01:17:23.087 --> 01:17:24.087
Hey.

01:17:24.545 --> 01:17:25.961
I just downloaded some extra
B-roll

01:17:26.044 --> 01:17:27.586
that must have got
lost in the shuffle.

01:17:27.669 --> 01:17:28.544
You should check it out.

01:17:28.628 --> 01:17:29.544
Okay. Thanks, I will.

01:17:29.628 --> 01:17:30.878
File's named "New."

01:17:31.669 --> 01:17:33.128
[Hank] You know, Will he's like,

01:17:33.211 --> 01:17:35.211
he's this tall, good looking
young man.

01:17:35.294 --> 01:17:38.211
You wouldn't expect it,
but he's got a heart of gold.

01:17:38.294 --> 01:17:39.960
And uh, I just love the guy.

01:17:45.085 --> 01:17:47.168
And uh, I just love the guy.

01:17:48.043 --> 01:17:50.543
It was probably my favorite
Christmas present of all time.

01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:51.960
High five!

01:18:02.667 --> 01:18:04.167
Hey, I got your text, what's up?

01:18:04.251 --> 01:18:06.459
Bravada moved up the viewing
meeting. It's in two hours.

01:18:06.542 --> 01:18:08.333
Two hours? No, it's not
for two days!

01:18:08.416 --> 01:18:09.958
Bentley has to
leave town tonight,

01:18:10.041 --> 01:18:11.750
wants to see a cut
in person, with us.

01:18:11.833 --> 01:18:13.309
No, it's nowhere close
to being ready...

01:18:13.333 --> 01:18:15.017
It's not like they haven't
seen footage already.

01:18:15.041 --> 01:18:17.250
They cut promos, remember?
They're expecting rough.

01:18:17.541 --> 01:18:18.458
How rough is it?

01:18:18.541 --> 01:18:19.833
I mean it's long, but watchable.

01:18:19.916 --> 01:18:21.332
Fine, just wrap it up.

01:18:21.415 --> 01:18:22.249
Paul, I've been meaning to...

01:18:22.332 --> 01:18:23.249
I don't have time.

01:18:23.332 --> 01:18:25.016
I need to crunch numbers with
Lindsey before the meeting.

01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:26.124
- Okay.
- Thank you.

01:18:27.082 --> 01:18:30.540
Our goal is to launch with
a subject and a situation

01:18:30.624 --> 01:18:34.457
so unique and strange,
yet relatable,

01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:36.038
that it will set the bar

01:18:36.039 --> 01:18:40.081
for an entire year of
extreme holiday madness.

01:18:40.456 --> 01:18:42.140
At the same time, we've
tried to split the difference

01:18:42.164 --> 01:18:44.623
between sentiment
and sensationalism.

01:18:44.706 --> 01:18:46.123
Entertaining, but authentic.

01:18:46.206 --> 01:18:47.367
And I think you'll agree that

01:18:47.414 --> 01:18:50.413
we have found a major star
in Will Saunders.

01:18:50.497 --> 01:18:51.538
Let's see what you've got.

01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:52.830
Of course.

01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:58.622
Hi, I'm Will Saunders

01:18:58.705 --> 01:19:00.705
and welcome to my
Christmas wonderland.

01:19:01.288 --> 01:19:03.162
Hi, I'm Will Saunders

01:19:03.246 --> 01:19:05.412
and welcome to my
Christmas wonderland.

01:19:05.496 --> 01:19:07.621
Welcome to my
Christmas wonderland!

01:19:08.329 --> 01:19:09.996
This shirt sucks.

01:19:11.371 --> 01:19:12.954
Hey, I'm Will Saunders

01:19:13.037 --> 01:19:14.787
and welcome to my
Christmas wonderland.

01:19:15.246 --> 01:19:16.953
You sure I don't look silly?

01:19:17.245 --> 01:19:18.245
I love that.

01:19:19.370 --> 01:19:20.411
How's it look?

01:19:23.495 --> 01:19:24.971
It's kind of crazy town
for my tastes.

01:19:24.995 --> 01:19:27.328
But my kids love it, so
what're you going to do?

01:19:27.411 --> 01:19:28.911
I wouldn't want to pay
his light bill!

01:19:28.995 --> 01:19:30.328
I hate the whole thing.

01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:36.952
Will is like this tall,
good looking young man.

01:19:37.994 --> 01:19:41.369
You wouldn't expect it,
but he's got a heart of gold

01:19:41.452 --> 01:19:43.452
and I just love the guy.

01:19:49.243 --> 01:19:51.344
[Will] Imagine if we could
keep the spirit of Christmas,

01:19:51.368 --> 01:19:53.451
with all its joy and generosity
and good will

01:19:54.326 --> 01:19:55.534
alive all year round.

01:19:56.243 --> 01:19:58.076
Think how much better off
we'd be?

01:19:59.158 --> 01:20:02.325
I don't always succeed,
but it's what I try to do.

01:20:04.575 --> 01:20:05.575
Wow.

01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:10.492
That really wasn't like the
promos we cut, now was it?

01:20:10.575 --> 01:20:12.949
Jayla, let me explain...

01:20:13.324 --> 01:20:16.449
Actually, Sophia,
why don't you explain?

01:20:16.741 --> 01:20:17.574
Well...

01:20:17.657 --> 01:20:19.074
You know, that won't
be necessary.

01:20:19.741 --> 01:20:22.449
I know what I expected,
I know what I saw,

01:20:22.782 --> 01:20:24.282
and I know how I feel.

01:20:24.366 --> 01:20:25.407
I loved it.

01:20:25.491 --> 01:20:28.156
Yeah, those promos
that we cut drew eyeballs,

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:30.698
but now it is clear that
we can't have sustain

01:20:30.781 --> 01:20:32.406
that broad of a tone
for a whole show.

01:20:33.406 --> 01:20:36.990
Paul, you and your team found
the sweet spot in the story.

01:20:37.073 --> 01:20:39.448
You made it engaging and vivid,

01:20:39.531 --> 01:20:42.322
without sacrificing the charge
of reality TV.

01:20:43.197 --> 01:20:45.864
Heck, you almost kind
of redefined the genre.

01:20:45.989 --> 01:20:47.447
And just in time for Christmas.

01:20:47.530 --> 01:20:48.697
Well done, people.

01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:49.655
Congratulations.

01:20:49.739 --> 01:20:53.155
We are thrilled that
you enjoyed the...

01:20:53.239 --> 01:20:54.529
I've got a plane to catch!

01:20:55.404 --> 01:20:56.404
And Sophia?

01:20:56.738 --> 01:20:58.196
Thank Will for me, would you?

01:20:58.988 --> 01:21:01.863
It is clear that you really
brought out the best in him.

01:21:05.029 --> 01:21:06.654
Well, that was a surprise.

01:21:06.738 --> 01:21:08.362
All the way around.

01:21:08.695 --> 01:21:10.362
I tried to warn you
before we went in...

01:21:10.445 --> 01:21:11.463
It's a good thing you didn't.

01:21:11.487 --> 01:21:12.629
I probably would
have freaked out.

01:21:12.653 --> 01:21:14.403
Actually, I still might.

01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:17.338
I was just trying to do
the right thing for everyone.

01:21:17.362 --> 01:21:18.445
Including you.

01:21:18.528 --> 01:21:19.653
And Will.

01:21:20.153 --> 01:21:22.027
Not really. He doesn't
care anymore.

01:21:22.111 --> 01:21:23.777
You know what? His loss.

01:21:24.527 --> 01:21:26.236
Anyway, once we get
picture lock,

01:21:26.319 --> 01:21:28.151
we have to jump
on Valentine's Day.

01:21:28.152 --> 01:21:30.861
Now, I have got a couple
of romance freaks,

01:21:30.944 --> 01:21:33.027
but I want to know
what you think.

01:21:34.527 --> 01:21:35.527
I think...

01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:37.235
I quit.

01:21:37.318 --> 01:21:38.401
Great, quit what?

01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:40.110
My job.

01:21:41.485 --> 01:21:42.610
Excuse me?

01:21:43.610 --> 01:21:46.068
I realized in there that this
isn't the place for me.

01:21:46.151 --> 01:21:48.112
I don't want to sneak around
behind my boss's back

01:21:48.151 --> 01:21:49.650
to do what I think is right.

01:21:49.734 --> 01:21:50.900
What are you talking about?

01:21:51.567 --> 01:21:53.734
I somehow thought
that I could take

01:21:53.817 --> 01:21:56.734
my love of documentary film
and bring it to reality TV.

01:21:56.817 --> 01:21:58.317
And that was very wrong.

01:21:58.859 --> 01:22:00.734
What happened in there
was a one-off.

01:22:00.817 --> 01:22:02.192
I got lucky, and I know that.

01:22:02.275 --> 01:22:04.155
We're going to go right back
to chasing ratings.

01:22:04.191 --> 01:22:07.274
Which is fine for some people,
just not for me.

01:22:08.066 --> 01:22:10.024
I'm sorry, did Will
put you up to this?

01:22:10.941 --> 01:22:12.816
Hardly. If anything, it was you.

01:22:13.441 --> 01:22:15.441
You're a sharp,
talented guy, Paul.

01:22:15.524 --> 01:22:18.690
But your eye is on the prize,
not the passion.

01:22:19.523 --> 01:22:22.815
Don't worry, I'm going to help
you deliver the show on Friday.

01:22:23.023 --> 01:22:25.565
And if you're thinking about
replacing me, consider Lindsey.

01:22:25.898 --> 01:22:26.898
She's the best.

01:22:28.690 --> 01:22:30.148
Merry Christmas, Paul.

01:22:32.231 --> 01:22:33.939
What does Christmas
have to do with it?

01:22:47.271 --> 01:22:48.563
[door knocking]

01:23:40.435 --> 01:23:42.059
[Sophia] Dear Will,

01:23:42.142 --> 01:23:44.267
I hate the idea that
your last thoughts of me

01:23:44.351 --> 01:23:46.017
are such disappointing ones.

01:23:47.101 --> 01:23:49.059
As I got to know the man
you truly are,

01:23:49.476 --> 01:23:52.809
my respect and my feeling
for you grew and took shape

01:23:52.892 --> 01:23:55.516
in ways that, honestly,
surprised me.

01:23:57.266 --> 01:23:59.850
Now my greatest wish
is that I can be a person

01:23:59.933 --> 01:24:01.683
you'd respect
with equal measure.

01:24:03.225 --> 01:24:05.850
Even if I never see you again,
I want to be a woman

01:24:05.933 --> 01:24:08.557
who deserves an amazing man
like you.

01:24:09.099 --> 01:24:12.390
Thank you for being that man.
Love, Sophia.

01:24:20.724 --> 01:24:22.931
Welcome to my
Christmas wonderland!

01:24:23.889 --> 01:24:25.598
This shirt sucks.

01:24:26.389 --> 01:24:28.139
I wouldn't want to pay
his light bill!

01:24:28.806 --> 01:24:30.514
I hate the whole thing.

01:24:31.598 --> 01:24:35.514
Will is like this tall,
good looking young man.

01:24:36.181 --> 01:24:39.180
You wouldn't expect it,
but he's got a heart of gold.

01:24:39.930 --> 01:24:41.180
I just love the guy.

01:24:45.847 --> 01:24:46.847
Hi.

01:24:47.888 --> 01:24:50.554
I was in the neighborhood,
thought I'd drop by.

01:24:51.721 --> 01:24:53.512
With irises?

01:24:56.429 --> 01:24:57.429
Yup.

01:25:06.386 --> 01:25:08.636
So, did you watch the show?

01:25:09.053 --> 01:25:10.053
I did.

01:25:11.136 --> 01:25:12.178
And?

01:25:12.511 --> 01:25:14.095
It wasn't half as bad
as I expected.

01:25:14.178 --> 01:25:16.845
Oh, hold off on the praise,
okay?

01:25:16.928 --> 01:25:19.135
I'm saying I got what
you were going for.

01:25:19.510 --> 01:25:22.552
You tried to keep it real,
make me seem okay,

01:25:22.635 --> 01:25:24.516
but give the audience enough
of that dopey stuff

01:25:24.552 --> 01:25:25.969
they'd need to keep watching.

01:25:28.385 --> 01:25:30.260
And I know it wasn't what
you were told to do,

01:25:30.344 --> 01:25:32.134
but you did it anyway.

01:25:34.009 --> 01:25:35.718
I know you did that for me.

01:25:36.176 --> 01:25:40.759
I didn't do it for you,
I did it because of you.

01:25:42.093 --> 01:25:43.934
Because of who you showed
the cameras you were.

01:25:44.926 --> 01:25:46.800
I didn't go to film school
for nothing!

01:25:47.217 --> 01:25:48.550
And you didn't get in trouble?

01:25:48.633 --> 01:25:50.508
The network flipped over it.

01:25:50.592 --> 01:25:52.592
Paul folded like a deck chair.

01:25:53.425 --> 01:25:55.008
They're already onto
Valentine's Day.

01:25:55.883 --> 01:25:58.217
So that must make you
Super Real's new golden girl.

01:25:58.633 --> 01:25:59.799
Oh, it totally did.

01:26:00.799 --> 01:26:02.341
I'm happy for you, Sophia.

01:26:06.091 --> 01:26:07.674
But I quit.

01:26:08.549 --> 01:26:09.674
You quit?

01:26:10.799 --> 01:26:12.341
What do you mean, you quit?

01:26:12.424 --> 01:26:15.131
I want to get excited
about what I do.

01:26:16.298 --> 01:26:18.965
I want solve problems with
my art, not make them.

01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:22.401
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

01:26:23.215 --> 01:26:25.423
I have no idea what I'm doing.

01:26:27.547 --> 01:26:29.255
But I am sure about one thing.

01:26:29.714 --> 01:26:32.255
Oh yeah? What's that?

01:26:33.797 --> 01:26:35.214
That I really miss you.

01:26:36.714 --> 01:26:38.589
And I hope you know that,
no matter what,

01:26:38.672 --> 01:26:40.089
you can trust me again.

01:26:43.254 --> 01:26:44.254
I do.

01:26:46.171 --> 01:26:48.088
I understand now what
you were up against,

01:26:48.629 --> 01:26:50.629
how much was truly
out of your control.

01:26:51.671 --> 01:26:55.378
What happened wasn't
intentional, or personal.

01:26:56.878 --> 01:26:58.253
Until it was personal.

01:26:59.587 --> 01:27:01.378
Yeah, I think I remember those.

01:27:02.712 --> 01:27:04.378
They were pretty good,
weren't they?

01:27:05.253 --> 01:27:06.420
They were okay.

01:27:06.503 --> 01:27:07.587
Only okay?

01:27:10.419 --> 01:27:11.711
What are you thinking?

01:27:12.752 --> 01:27:14.252
I'm thinking...

01:27:15.002 --> 01:27:17.252
About you, and me.

01:27:18.044 --> 01:27:20.211
Without all that noise
from the show between us.

01:27:21.377 --> 01:27:22.919
I like that thought.

01:27:25.335 --> 01:27:28.793
If you'll have me, Sophia,
I'm yours.
