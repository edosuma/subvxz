00:00.234 --> 00:01.534
<i>Previously on "Bitten"...</i>

00:01.536 --> 00:02.702
Dennis Stillwell is dead.

00:02.703 --> 00:04.568
- What about Joey?
- There was only one body.

00:04.584 --> 00:05.950
I'll be honest with you, Victor,

00:05.952 --> 00:07.351
I hate the thought of letting you out.

00:07.353 --> 00:08.753
He had a coop in his backyard

00:08.755 --> 00:10.188
where he raised rabbits.

00:10.190 --> 00:12.526
He used the rabbits as a lure,

00:12.527 --> 00:14.561
and the coop as something else.

00:14.563 --> 00:16.729
What I do care about is payback.

00:16.731 --> 00:18.664
- Which one?
- Elena Michaels.

00:18.666 --> 00:20.332
Where did you find this?

00:20.334 --> 00:22.301
<i>One of the board members</i>
<i>found it on the internet.</i>

00:22.303 --> 00:23.636
It's a gift.

00:23.638 --> 00:25.771
That's so sweet! Who's it from?

00:25.773 --> 00:26.973
You didn't tell anyone?

00:26.975 --> 00:28.307
That's our family at Bear Valley.

00:28.309 --> 00:29.508
Who's that?

00:29.510 --> 00:30.943
That's our cousin Clay.

00:32.780 --> 00:34.780
I thought I'd lost you today.

00:34.782 --> 00:36.415
But you're safe,

00:36.417 --> 00:38.450
here with me.

00:40.019 --> 00:41.720
I have a photography show.

00:41.722 --> 00:43.288
My big debut, I have to be there.

00:43.290 --> 00:44.823
I want to send
Clay back with you.

00:44.825 --> 00:47.626
I don't want Clay in
Toronto and you know why.

01:02.207 --> 01:05.409
Sending me to Toronto
with you was all Jeremy.

01:05.411 --> 01:07.045
I had nothing to do with it.

01:07.047 --> 01:08.412
You could offer to stay.

01:08.414 --> 01:10.615
You know I can't do that, darlin'.

01:10.617 --> 01:12.983
Jeremy's right. It isn't
safe for you to go alone.

01:12.985 --> 01:14.552
Fine.

01:14.554 --> 01:16.987
But I want to be clear about
how we're going to do this.

01:16.989 --> 01:19.957
We go, we collect Logan, we come back.

01:19.959 --> 01:21.992
I mean <i>this.</i>

01:23.061 --> 01:24.828
Look, I have an art opening,

01:24.830 --> 01:27.330
it's my first solo exhibit and...

01:27.332 --> 01:29.700
it's my first chance to make a mark.

01:29.702 --> 01:32.302
Even more reason for me to go with you.

01:34.839 --> 01:37.574
Then I want to come clean with you.

01:37.576 --> 01:40.644
- About last night?
- About everything.

01:42.780 --> 01:45.215
Last night, I was feeling vulnerable

01:45.217 --> 01:47.651
and I needed to feel safe again, and...

01:47.653 --> 01:49.619
in that moment, I did.

01:49.621 --> 01:51.421
You're always safe with me.

01:51.423 --> 01:53.956
I'm not, and you know that.

01:55.859 --> 01:58.661
For some reason, Jeremy thinks otherwise.

01:58.663 --> 02:02.131
And I can't let you go into Toronto
without knowing the truth.

02:02.133 --> 02:05.301
Right. The guy who sends you lilacs.

02:05.303 --> 02:07.036
What's his name?

02:07.038 --> 02:08.637
Philip.

02:10.774 --> 02:12.641
How long have you been with him?

02:14.178 --> 02:16.245
Six months.

02:16.247 --> 02:19.548
You know, it's one thing for Jeremy
to say that you should stay with me,

02:19.550 --> 02:20.982
but you can't.

02:23.152 --> 02:25.153
I live with Philip.

02:32.128 --> 02:35.197
Last night wasn't a mistake for me.

02:36.833 --> 02:41.502
But I promise, I'm done hurting you.

02:41.504 --> 02:43.872
We go to Toronto,

02:43.874 --> 02:47.642
I won't do anything to
undermine your life there.

02:47.644 --> 02:49.110
And that?

02:59.154 --> 03:00.955
Thank you.

03:17.573 --> 03:19.439
- Hello?
- It's Joey.

03:19.441 --> 03:21.475
Thank god, I thought you were dead.

03:21.477 --> 03:24.378
The Mutts, they had me.

03:24.380 --> 03:26.980
Cain, Santos, Marsten.

03:26.982 --> 03:28.815
I escaped, I need you
to help me, please.

03:28.817 --> 03:31.084
<i>Nicky, they killed my dad.</i>

03:31.086 --> 03:34.655
I know, Joey, I'm sorry.
Tell me where you are.

03:34.657 --> 03:36.623
Some factory, Highway 46.

03:36.625 --> 03:40.660
<i>- Mile marker 7.</i>
- Okay, okay. Stay put.

03:40.662 --> 03:42.796
I'm coming to get you, buddy.

03:53.541 --> 03:55.675
I know I owe you
guys an explanation.

03:55.677 --> 03:57.610
We've been sent to bring you back.

03:57.612 --> 03:59.512
Jeremy's worried about you.

03:59.514 --> 04:01.480
So are we. What's going on?

04:01.482 --> 04:04.116
Yeah. H... how's Nick holding up?

04:04.118 --> 04:06.652
- He's holding.
- You should've been there.

04:06.654 --> 04:08.287
I know.

04:08.289 --> 04:10.155
It's just that, uh...

04:12.591 --> 04:15.027
Rachel's pregnant.

04:15.029 --> 04:16.327
It's a boy.

04:17.997 --> 04:19.397
A werewolf.

04:19.399 --> 04:21.466
One of us.

04:21.468 --> 04:23.268
Okay. Um...

04:23.270 --> 04:25.237
So that's why you've
been avoiding Jeremy.

04:25.239 --> 04:27.572
I'm avoiding Pack Law.
You know, the one that says

04:27.574 --> 04:30.775
I'm supposed to steal my newborn son from
his mother and raise him as one of us?

04:33.479 --> 04:35.112
Yesterday, I got this.

04:39.251 --> 04:41.586
Thing is, no one knows we're pregnant,

04:41.588 --> 04:42.854
let alone that it's a boy.

04:42.856 --> 04:45.589
It's got to be Santos.

04:45.591 --> 04:47.892
He's been tracking our every move.

04:47.894 --> 04:51.295
Jeremy needs to know
about this. All of it.

04:51.297 --> 04:53.030
Trust me, I know.

04:53.032 --> 04:55.499
I've been trying to figure out
how to explain this to him.

04:55.501 --> 04:57.168
I was going to tell him about the gift,

04:57.170 --> 04:58.870
but I was afraid he was
going to order me home.

04:58.872 --> 05:00.838
And I'm not going to leave Rachel alone.

05:00.840 --> 05:03.474
It's not like I can
take her to Stonehaven.

05:03.476 --> 05:07.244
I know I'm the last person you'd
expect to hear this from,

05:07.246 --> 05:09.780
but you should talk to him.

05:09.782 --> 05:13.417
The Pack has been through
a lot, and he needs you.

05:13.419 --> 05:16.987
And whether you realize it
or not, you need him too.

05:16.989 --> 05:20.056
Especially if the Mutts are behind this.

05:20.058 --> 05:23.894
You need the support
and protection of the Pack.

05:30.969 --> 05:33.369
Well, look at you...

05:33.371 --> 05:35.705
all grown up.

05:41.279 --> 05:43.746
Hmmm...

05:43.748 --> 05:45.815
Yeah...

Bitten 1x10 - Descent
Original air date March 15, 2014

06:23.496 --> 06:25.510
I think this goes beyond the rattle.

06:25.533 --> 06:28.767
There's a video of us running as wolves
at Cherry Beach.

06:30.070 --> 06:31.436
What are you talking about?

06:34.640 --> 06:37.475
Look, Clay knows everything
about my life here, Logan.

06:37.477 --> 06:40.612
Philip came by, asking
a lot of questions.

06:40.614 --> 06:42.380
Philip has the video?

06:42.382 --> 06:44.115
One of his clients sent him footage

06:44.117 --> 06:46.083
for this ad campaign he's working on.

06:46.085 --> 06:47.452
Did he say who his client is?

06:47.454 --> 06:48.820
No, and thankfully,

06:48.822 --> 06:50.521
he didn't seem too
interested in the wolves.

06:50.523 --> 06:52.423
Mostly because he was focused on the fact

06:52.425 --> 06:54.859
that your necklace and clothes were
underneath the lifeguard tower.

06:54.861 --> 06:56.861
Elena, he thought we
were having an affair.

06:56.863 --> 06:58.129
What did you tell him?

06:58.131 --> 07:00.364
I told him we went for
a swim after our run.

07:00.366 --> 07:02.499
Great. Skinny-dipping with my cousin,

07:02.501 --> 07:04.068
'cause that's not weird at all.

07:04.070 --> 07:06.637
Well, he stopped suspecting
me of anything...

07:08.306 --> 07:10.541
after he saw this.

07:10.543 --> 07:13.577
What exactly do you think he saw?

07:13.579 --> 07:15.178
Look, the important thing

07:15.180 --> 07:17.748
is that his client gave him
footage that links to Elena.

07:17.750 --> 07:19.916
That can't be a coincidence.

07:19.918 --> 07:22.185
Look, I'll deal with it, okay?

07:22.187 --> 07:24.020
Rachel is catering my opening tomorrow.

07:24.022 --> 07:25.621
We'll both be there.

07:25.623 --> 07:27.824
That'll give you enough
time to talk to Jeremy.

07:27.826 --> 07:29.092
All right?

07:31.195 --> 07:33.129
There were voices,
there were a few voices,

07:33.131 --> 07:34.697
one was talking about rabbits,

07:34.699 --> 07:36.666
one was mocking me about my dad.

07:36.668 --> 07:38.335
They never took the bag off me...

07:38.337 --> 07:40.703
Nicky, they never took
the bag off of me.

07:40.705 --> 07:42.405
Nick, his pulse is all over the place.

07:42.407 --> 07:43.806
He must be dehydrated.

07:43.808 --> 07:45.641
Get him water, I'll get the medical kit.

07:48.747 --> 07:51.414
They crashed into our house and they...

07:51.416 --> 07:54.684
They ripped his eyes out
right in front of me, man!

07:54.686 --> 07:56.886
...screaming and begging them to stop!

07:56.888 --> 07:58.787
Drink up, buddy. Can you drink this?

07:58.789 --> 08:02.024
Come on, get it in you.

08:02.026 --> 08:03.592
Ah... Yeah...

08:03.594 --> 08:05.294
Joe, I'm the one that found him.

08:05.296 --> 08:08.530
Okay? I'm the one that
found him, your dad,

08:08.532 --> 08:10.465
and I'm the one who buried him.

08:10.467 --> 08:13.368
I did it the way that you would've
wanted if you were there.

08:13.370 --> 08:14.536
Okay?

08:14.538 --> 08:16.838
I'm glad it was you, man.

08:18.275 --> 08:20.609
They got my dad too, Joey.

08:20.611 --> 08:22.811
- They got him too.
- No. - Yeah.

08:22.813 --> 08:24.045
No...

08:26.181 --> 08:28.082
You gotta get these guys.

08:28.084 --> 08:29.918
Nicky, you gotta get these guys.

08:29.920 --> 08:31.786
I will, Joey, okay? Don't you worry.

08:31.788 --> 08:33.288
We're going to get them.

08:35.124 --> 08:37.691
Let's just focus on
getting you better first.

08:44.300 --> 08:47.735
Okay. Two seconds. I just need
to grab my dress and heels,

08:47.737 --> 08:50.704
and we'll go. Don't touch anything.

09:00.817 --> 09:03.817
How are you going to explain
that you're staying in a hotel?

09:03.819 --> 09:06.820
Easier to explain me at a
hotel than you on the couch.

09:06.822 --> 09:09.022
And easier to explain than last night.

09:09.024 --> 09:10.723
Don't do this, Clay.

09:20.768 --> 09:23.336
There's my girl.

09:23.338 --> 09:24.938
Missed you.

09:24.940 --> 09:26.739
- Missed you too.
- This is?

09:26.741 --> 09:29.342
Uh, this is Clay, my cousin.

09:29.344 --> 09:31.043
Clay, this is Philip.

09:33.347 --> 09:34.747
Heard a lot about you.

09:34.749 --> 09:36.915
I wish I could say the same about you.

09:36.917 --> 09:39.685
You didn't mention you
were bringing guests.

09:39.687 --> 09:41.253
Actually, he was just leaving.

09:41.255 --> 09:43.222
He's staying at a hotel. Right?

09:43.224 --> 09:46.892
Well, we can't have a cousin
of Elena's staying at a hotel.

09:46.894 --> 09:48.827
You should stay with us.

09:48.829 --> 09:50.529
Y...you wouldn't be comfortable.

09:50.531 --> 09:53.398
I mean, come on, you won't
even fit on the couch.

09:57.637 --> 09:59.237
Couch is fine.

09:59.239 --> 10:01.473
Then it's settled. You'll stay with us.

10:01.475 --> 10:03.809
After all, you're family.

10:06.946 --> 10:08.846
You were supposed to call in.

10:08.848 --> 10:10.715
Why do I have to look for you?

10:10.717 --> 10:12.417
A man's gotta eat.

10:12.419 --> 10:14.552
You're not working alone anymore.

10:14.554 --> 10:16.454
When I say "call in",

10:16.456 --> 10:17.889
- call in.
- Fine.

10:17.891 --> 10:20.191
No need to get your panties in a twist.

10:20.193 --> 10:22.894
Tell me what happened.

10:22.896 --> 10:25.462
She's back here in Toronto,
just like you predicted.

10:25.464 --> 10:27.331
Good.

10:27.333 --> 10:29.834
And she looks exactly the same.

10:29.836 --> 10:31.101
Older, sure.

10:31.103 --> 10:33.237
But I see there's still that lost,

10:33.239 --> 10:35.406
abandoned girl in her eyes.

10:35.408 --> 10:36.974
So we're clear, right?

10:36.976 --> 10:39.143
Deal is, you get revenge.

10:39.145 --> 10:41.645
- You don't get to touch her.
- Yeah.

10:43.814 --> 10:45.215
We made you, Victor.

10:45.217 --> 10:47.251
You didn't make me, Cain did.

10:47.253 --> 10:48.985
And Cain answered to me.

10:50.188 --> 10:52.656
Don't bite the hand that feeds.

11:03.935 --> 11:07.203
Must've been hard to build an
ad agency from the ground up.

11:07.205 --> 11:08.672
It took a long time,

11:08.674 --> 11:10.574
but it's finally starting
to pay dividends.

11:10.576 --> 11:12.842
Do you find your clients,
or do they find you?

11:12.844 --> 11:14.444
A bit of both, actually.

11:14.446 --> 11:16.645
Working on anything interesting?

11:16.647 --> 11:18.548
You know what I'm interested in,

11:18.550 --> 11:20.450
is what brings you to Toronto, Clay.

11:20.452 --> 11:22.385
Uh, anthropology.

11:22.387 --> 11:25.421
I'm looking at teaching again
next semester at U of T.

11:25.423 --> 11:27.756
And of course, I didn't want
to miss Elena's big show.

11:27.758 --> 11:30.993
Of course. Her first big solo opening.

11:30.995 --> 11:33.696
But it's no surprise she's
come so far, so fast.

11:33.698 --> 11:36.198
Yes, Toronto's been
good for her that way.

11:36.200 --> 11:38.400
No one captures
the purity of human form

11:38.402 --> 11:39.735
quite like Elena.

11:39.737 --> 11:41.770
Actually, I get
something different.

11:41.772 --> 11:43.906
More the conflicted nature of humanity,

11:43.908 --> 11:45.741
mankind's baser instincts

11:45.743 --> 11:48.510
fighting to get out
even while we deny them.

11:48.512 --> 11:50.945
Well, that's a great
thing about art, right?

11:50.947 --> 11:52.247
It's subjective.

11:52.249 --> 11:54.549
So...

11:54.551 --> 11:56.918
It's been a long day,
I think I'm going to turn in.

11:56.920 --> 12:00.655
Yeah, seems to be about that time.

12:00.657 --> 12:02.190
Make yourself at home.

12:14.269 --> 12:15.536
Pffft.

12:19.074 --> 12:21.041
I really missed you.

12:21.043 --> 12:22.643
- Yeah?
- Of course,

12:22.645 --> 12:25.412
I always miss you when I'm away.

12:25.414 --> 12:27.814
Then don't go away anymore.

12:27.816 --> 12:29.583
Be here with me.

12:44.499 --> 12:48.035
Oh, yeah. Your cousin.

12:48.037 --> 12:49.670
Sorry. I guess I'm just not comfortable

12:49.672 --> 12:51.138
with him being in the other room.

12:51.140 --> 12:53.273
No, it's fine, I get it.

13:03.951 --> 13:06.286
- You should get some sleep.
- Yeah.

13:06.288 --> 13:08.888
- Big day tomorrow.
- Sure.

13:08.890 --> 13:11.623
- Good night.
- Good night.

14:45.785 --> 14:47.418
What the hell are you doing?

14:47.420 --> 14:49.420
Easy. Just making breakfast.

14:50.822 --> 14:54.425
Wow! Hot meal, what a treat!

14:54.427 --> 14:57.761
Elena's, uh, not much of a
breakfast person though.

14:57.763 --> 14:59.496
Maybe it's the turkey bacon.

14:59.498 --> 15:01.799
Back home, she can't get
enough of the real thing.

15:01.801 --> 15:04.568
I like turkey bacon just fine, thanks.

15:07.338 --> 15:09.372
Diane's waiting for me at the gallery.

15:09.374 --> 15:10.640
I should go.

15:13.344 --> 15:14.945
You're coming?

15:16.847 --> 15:20.516
- Are you able to join us?
- I can't. Sorry. Work.

15:20.518 --> 15:23.153
Exhale and enjoy your big day.

15:28.258 --> 15:30.927
- I will see you there, though.
- Okay.

15:30.929 --> 15:33.028
Thank you for doing this.

15:38.001 --> 15:40.035
I guess this'll have to wait.

15:42.773 --> 15:44.473
Joey, help me understand

15:44.475 --> 15:47.876
why the Mutts killed your
father but spared you.

15:47.878 --> 15:51.680
They had this newly-turned
Mutt that they were training.

15:51.682 --> 15:54.716
Lucky me, I got to be
his practice victim.

15:54.718 --> 15:57.286
I was supposed to be his
first kill as a wolf.

15:57.288 --> 15:58.820
What happened?

15:58.822 --> 16:00.489
Well, when they released me for the hunt,

16:00.491 --> 16:01.990
they gave me a headstart.

16:01.992 --> 16:06.661
And, uh, I ran as fast as I
could, and then I hid and...

16:06.663 --> 16:08.864
I covered my scent.

16:08.866 --> 16:10.765
- Covered your scent.
- Yeah, you remember, right?

16:10.767 --> 16:12.634
It's a trick Nicky had

16:12.636 --> 16:14.503
from when we were kids
playing hide and seek.

16:14.505 --> 16:16.637
Mmm, yeah. Cover your body in mud,

16:16.639 --> 16:19.040
- hide your scent.
- Yeah, from head to toe.

16:19.042 --> 16:21.976
Took me hours to find him...
if I found him at all.

16:21.978 --> 16:23.878
Anyway, I, um... I hid

16:23.880 --> 16:25.846
and I stayed there through the night.

16:25.848 --> 16:28.749
And the next morning, when I was
sure everyone were gone, I...

16:28.751 --> 16:31.919
I ran until I found a payphone
and I called you guys.

16:31.921 --> 16:34.121
Can you take us to that place?

16:34.123 --> 16:37.625
Th... they drove me a
few miles out for the hunt

16:37.627 --> 16:39.994
and they... they had me
pretty drugged up,

16:39.996 --> 16:42.930
to keep me from... from Changing.

16:42.932 --> 16:45.666
Anything else you can remember
about the place they kept you?

16:45.668 --> 16:47.401
I was blindfolded, I...

16:47.403 --> 16:49.136
I didn't see much of anything.

16:49.138 --> 16:50.737
But from the way sound travelled,

16:50.739 --> 16:55.509
their place was big, and
open like a warehouse.

16:55.511 --> 16:58.278
And the... the other thing
I remember is that it...

16:58.280 --> 17:00.280
smelled like vanilla. Huh.

17:02.283 --> 17:05.185
There was one phone call I
overheard, though, it was...

17:05.186 --> 17:08.119
It was Santos, he was
talking to somebody.

17:08.122 --> 17:11.390
And it wasn't Marsten, 'cause
Marsten had just left.

17:11.392 --> 17:14.961
And he was talking about Clay.

17:14.963 --> 17:17.730
Talking about turning
him against the Pack.

17:20.733 --> 17:23.202
At least that's what it
sounded like, to me.

17:26.673 --> 17:28.874
Can I have some more of those pancakes?

17:30.177 --> 17:31.577
Sure.

17:43.590 --> 17:45.190
She lives!

17:45.192 --> 17:47.425
I was worried you weren't
going to make it!

17:47.427 --> 17:50.696
Aw, I'm so glad you're back!

17:50.698 --> 17:53.231
- We have a million things to do.
- I know.

17:53.233 --> 17:56.401
Carbs... I remember you.

17:59.105 --> 18:00.871
Screw it.

18:00.873 --> 18:04.675
We have to decide where everything
goes and finalize pricing.

18:08.848 --> 18:10.448
Show's not till tonight,
but, please come back.

18:10.450 --> 18:12.883
Actually, Diane, this is my cousin Clay.

18:12.885 --> 18:15.285
Clay, this is Philip's sister Diane.

18:16.688 --> 18:19.957
It's about time we got
to meet Elena's family.

18:19.959 --> 18:21.926
And here we are, two in one day.

18:21.928 --> 18:24.595
Logan and Rachel are
unloading the catering,

18:24.597 --> 18:26.330
and... now you.

18:26.332 --> 18:28.865
- This space is amazing.
- Mmm.

18:28.867 --> 18:31.101
My very own show.

18:31.103 --> 18:33.036
The first of many, I'm sure.

18:33.038 --> 18:34.938
You're a great friend.

18:34.940 --> 18:36.773
I really don't deserve this right now.

18:36.775 --> 18:39.009
Hey, I'm also your biggest fan, remember?

18:39.011 --> 18:40.477
Second biggest.

18:40.479 --> 18:42.312
How long are you in town for, Clay?

18:42.314 --> 18:44.281
- Just for the show.
- We should really

18:44.283 --> 18:46.950
- hang these photographs now.
- Mm-hmm.

18:46.952 --> 18:49.653
- I should go see Logan off.
- Yeah.

18:53.991 --> 18:56.359
Okay, what is his story? Single?

18:57.695 --> 18:59.996
What? I hooked you up with my brother!

18:59.998 --> 19:02.097
Quid pro quo, my friend.

19:02.099 --> 19:05.868
This is a bonus. Not only do
I finally get to meet Clay,

19:05.870 --> 19:07.403
I get a little muscle on the scene.

19:07.405 --> 19:09.539
Well... a lot of muscle.

19:09.541 --> 19:10.973
Ah-ah, I got this.

19:17.514 --> 19:18.947
Hey, uh... You know, just call me

19:18.949 --> 19:20.448
if anything happens, okay?

19:20.450 --> 19:21.950
- Anything at all, okay?
- Babe,

19:21.952 --> 19:23.451
everything is going to be fine.

19:23.453 --> 19:25.520
You're going to worry
yourself into an aneurism.

19:25.522 --> 19:28.057
Look, I need to go over the final
menu with Diane and Elena.

19:28.059 --> 19:30.059
Travel safe. I love you.

19:33.229 --> 19:36.064
I mean it, anything. Anything.

19:36.066 --> 19:37.499
Okay.

19:41.770 --> 19:43.004
I should stay.

19:43.006 --> 19:44.972
We won't let anything happen to her.

19:44.974 --> 19:46.341
You have my word. I...

19:46.343 --> 19:48.543
Go. We got this.

19:48.545 --> 19:50.378
I'm glad you're here.

19:50.380 --> 19:52.546
You know, telling Jeremy
isn't going to be easy.

19:52.548 --> 19:55.382
I have a lot to account for, but you
know, what do you think? Maybe...

19:55.384 --> 19:57.284
maybe he's ready to rethink old ways.

19:57.286 --> 20:00.387
Let me raise my son with Rachel.
What do you think?

20:00.389 --> 20:03.524
Jeremy cares about
the Pack above all else.

20:03.526 --> 20:05.426
You might not get the answer you want.

20:08.263 --> 20:10.764
But if you've got to make a choice,

20:10.766 --> 20:13.133
you make sure it's one
you can live with.

20:21.610 --> 20:24.244
Okay.

20:24.246 --> 20:28.081
This is the factory where we found Joey.

20:28.083 --> 20:30.383
And assuming that they
dropped him off for the hunt

20:30.385 --> 20:33.486
no more than 10 miles from
where they were keeping him...

20:33.488 --> 20:36.056
and estimating the distance he
could've travelled on foot,

20:36.058 --> 20:38.591
- this is our search radius.
- Assuming, yes.

20:38.593 --> 20:42.595
Now, the thing is, it's mostly
suburbs or farmland around here.

20:42.597 --> 20:44.464
There's no abandoned food
factories or bakeries

20:44.466 --> 20:46.999
or anything that would
explain the vanilla smell.

20:47.001 --> 20:48.968
Well, perhaps there's a reason for that.

20:48.970 --> 20:50.403
What do you mean?

20:50.405 --> 20:52.772
The information Joey fed
us was decidedly vague.

20:52.774 --> 20:56.142
And the circumstances surrounding
his escape are suspicious at best.

20:57.911 --> 21:00.279
What are you saying?

21:00.281 --> 21:02.581
That Joey's working for the Mutts?

21:02.583 --> 21:05.484
Fear can be a very powerful motivator.

21:05.486 --> 21:08.754
He says the Mutts made him watch while
they cut out his father's eyes.

21:08.756 --> 21:11.891
Now, he asked me point blank
what our next move is.

21:11.893 --> 21:14.326
Why didn't the Mutts kill him?

21:14.328 --> 21:18.397
Maybe Joey traded his life for the
one thing he knew was our weakness:

21:18.399 --> 21:20.165
- our trust in him.
- So you're saying

21:20.167 --> 21:22.601
that all of that was an act?

21:22.603 --> 21:25.003
I grew up with this kid, okay?
I know him.

21:25.005 --> 21:28.707
How much time did you spend with
him over the last 10 years?

21:28.709 --> 21:31.109
We do not have the luxury of trust.

21:33.078 --> 21:35.646
When he wakes up, we
need to press him hard.

21:35.648 --> 21:39.017
- Jeremy, look...
- I hope that I'm wrong, Nicholas.

21:39.019 --> 21:41.319
I really hope I'm wrong.

21:41.321 --> 21:43.955
For our sake. And for his.

21:45.757 --> 21:48.693
I can't wait to see the
look on Elena's face.

21:48.695 --> 21:50.861
This isn't about rekindling
your old fetish.

21:50.863 --> 21:52.330
It's about exacting revenge.

21:52.332 --> 21:53.798
I hope your time inside
taught you restraint.

21:53.800 --> 21:55.766
Don't you talk to me about restraint.

21:55.768 --> 21:58.536
Somehow, I doubt impulse control
is one of your strong suits.

21:58.538 --> 22:01.339
You have no idea what it's like.

22:01.341 --> 22:03.307
To have this connection with someone

22:03.309 --> 22:05.876
but the whole world
wants to get in your way.

22:05.878 --> 22:08.212
Clingy parents. Suspicious teachers.

22:08.214 --> 22:09.980
Eyes on you, everywhere you go.

22:09.982 --> 22:13.250
Think that's easy? I know restraint.

22:13.252 --> 22:14.718
And I know patience.

22:14.720 --> 22:16.353
Elena isn't a child anymore.

22:16.355 --> 22:18.188
She never was.

22:18.190 --> 22:20.323
She didn't love like a child.

22:20.325 --> 22:23.125
Not the way the others loved me.

22:23.127 --> 22:26.262
They had pure, open hearts.

22:26.264 --> 22:28.465
Unconditional love.

22:28.467 --> 22:30.333
Of course she didn't love you.

22:30.335 --> 22:32.034
She testified against you.

22:32.036 --> 22:34.136
She betrayed me.

22:34.138 --> 22:36.339
You want me to focus on revenge?

22:36.341 --> 22:37.940
I'm already there.

22:42.493 --> 22:44.554
This looks very promising.

22:44.578 --> 22:47.546
And your eye for the human form...

22:47.548 --> 22:50.682
I see shades of Francis Bacon's work.

22:50.684 --> 22:53.419
That guy is a huge art buyer.

22:53.421 --> 22:55.053
If he throws his weight behind her,

22:55.055 --> 22:56.755
her career is as good as gold.

22:56.757 --> 23:00.392
I hope that means you'll be
coming to Toronto for her shows.

23:00.394 --> 23:01.927
Or do you come here often?

23:03.095 --> 23:06.298
Oh god, did I just say that?

23:06.300 --> 23:08.633
I used to teach anthropology at U of T.

23:08.635 --> 23:12.103
You did? Well, you should come back.

23:12.105 --> 23:14.605
- It's... complicated.
- Right.

23:14.607 --> 23:16.408
Borders and visas and...

23:16.410 --> 23:19.744
I tell you, trying to bring back a
$2 bottle of wine from Trader Joe's

23:19.746 --> 23:21.846
you need diplomatic immunity.

23:24.382 --> 23:26.751
You must be so proud of her.

23:26.753 --> 23:28.385
Proud doesn't begin to describe it.

23:28.387 --> 23:30.521
<i>By the way,</i>

23:30.523 --> 23:32.790
<i>I was really sorry to hear
about your cousin Danielle.</i>

23:32.792 --> 23:36.527
<i>- My cousin Danielle?</i>
<i>- Yeah, so tragic.</i>

23:36.529 --> 23:39.163
<i>You know, the car
accident and everything.</i>

23:39.165 --> 23:42.532
<i>We're all still a little shaken
up by it, but thank you.</i>

23:46.572 --> 23:50.274
Your father had the best
tracking ability in the Pack

23:50.276 --> 23:52.809
before Elena. He could literally
walk out the front door,

23:52.811 --> 23:56.145
and right away tell us exactly how
many deer were in the forest.

23:56.147 --> 23:58.482
We never wanted to leave the Pack.

24:00.317 --> 24:02.318
When you and Malcolm
battled it out for Alpha,

24:02.320 --> 24:04.087
my father was terrified.

24:04.089 --> 24:05.822
He said that if he sided with you,

24:05.824 --> 24:09.559
Malcolm would spend the rest
of his life making us pay.

24:09.561 --> 24:11.694
Malcolm's been dead for months.

24:11.696 --> 24:13.896
I know. It's unbelievable.

24:13.898 --> 24:15.398
I mean...

24:15.400 --> 24:18.334
We never thought anybody would
take Malcolm Danvers out.

24:18.336 --> 24:20.236
Yeah...

24:20.238 --> 24:22.805
You know I don't begrudge your
father for being afraid of Malcolm.

24:22.807 --> 24:25.441
He was a brutal, vindictive man.

24:25.443 --> 24:28.210
When I was little and he was angry,

24:28.212 --> 24:31.914
he would back-hand me
with his left hand.

24:31.916 --> 24:35.551
And sometimes when he was feeling
mean, he'd use his right.

24:35.553 --> 24:38.821
He wore a ring on that hand.

24:38.823 --> 24:41.390
That was my father.

24:41.392 --> 24:46.028
Your father could smell a deer
from over two miles away.

24:46.030 --> 24:48.296
So how is it, Joey,

24:48.298 --> 24:50.999
that the Mutts got close
enough to kill him

24:51.001 --> 24:53.268
and capture you, without
him smelling a thing?

25:15.925 --> 25:19.660
Sorry about your father.

25:19.662 --> 25:21.262
So am I.

25:21.264 --> 25:24.765
Look... I know I should've been here.

25:24.767 --> 25:26.567
- I'm sorry.
- You're here now.

25:28.303 --> 25:30.003
Just to come clean.

25:30.005 --> 25:31.505
Then I got to head back.

25:33.507 --> 25:35.709
It's Rachel.

25:35.711 --> 25:37.778
I can't leave her alone.

25:37.780 --> 25:40.013
- But once I explain to Jeremy...
- Uh...

25:40.015 --> 25:42.315
He's with Joey Stillwell.

25:42.317 --> 25:45.418
Why don't you and I grab
a drink while we wait.

25:45.420 --> 25:46.987
Yeah, okay.

25:49.090 --> 25:51.691
Whatever you have to tell
Jeremy, it can't be that bad.

25:51.693 --> 25:52.992
What is it? Come on.

25:52.994 --> 25:54.961
Just let me be the one
to tell him, okay?

25:54.963 --> 25:56.196
Yeah.

25:59.700 --> 26:01.634
I'm going to be a father.

26:06.206 --> 26:08.140
You wouldn't be this stressed

26:08.142 --> 26:09.541
if you were having a girl.

26:15.216 --> 26:18.350
This calls for something special.
Gimme that.

26:18.352 --> 26:20.486
My dad brought this back from Aberdeen.

26:22.122 --> 26:26.858
He left a gin drinker and came
back a Scotch aficionado.

26:26.860 --> 26:29.461
He used to spend hours

26:29.463 --> 26:33.665
telling me about casking,
and evaporation...

26:33.667 --> 26:36.868
He made us save it for a
special occasion, but...

26:36.870 --> 26:40.939
if he were here, he'd be
the first one to say...

26:40.941 --> 26:42.974
This is it.

26:42.976 --> 26:45.677
This is good news, brother.

26:45.679 --> 26:48.813
And we need good news right now.

26:48.815 --> 26:52.017
- Hey. To your father.
- To your son.

26:56.755 --> 26:57.988
Ahhh!

26:57.990 --> 27:00.424
Yeah, I was... I was on my way

27:00.426 --> 27:03.461
back here to tell Jeremy...

27:03.463 --> 27:06.631
that we got this gift.

27:06.633 --> 27:09.267
A rattle.

27:09.269 --> 27:11.435
We didn't tell anybody
about the pregnancy.

27:13.371 --> 27:17.675
It was Santos, up to his... usual tricks.

27:17.677 --> 27:20.477
I wasn't sure if he was in Toronto.

27:20.479 --> 27:22.445
I didn't want to leave her there alone.

27:22.447 --> 27:24.915
Santos, shit.

27:24.917 --> 27:27.350
We thought you were avoiding us.

27:27.352 --> 27:31.221
Yeah, it's not just about
protecting Rachel from the Mutts.

27:34.058 --> 27:36.893
I know it's Pack Law, but the idea of...

27:36.895 --> 27:38.795
taking my child away from her...

27:41.865 --> 27:43.466
Never seeing her again...

27:45.803 --> 27:47.870
So you were avoiding us.

28:08.959 --> 28:11.427
Are we having fun?

28:11.429 --> 28:13.596
You've done an amazing job.

28:13.598 --> 28:15.964
Oh... Elena deserves it.

28:15.966 --> 28:17.933
- Can I ask you something?
- Yes.

28:17.935 --> 28:19.835
James Williams, do you know him?

28:19.837 --> 28:21.402
We've never met personally, no.

28:21.404 --> 28:22.904
He tracked me down on Twitter.

28:22.906 --> 28:24.706
Story of my dating life too.

28:24.708 --> 28:26.908
- You know, the internet.
- Huh!

28:26.910 --> 28:28.744
What do you know about him?

28:28.746 --> 28:30.578
He's a big fan of Elena's work,

28:30.580 --> 28:33.248
and just so happens to be
the gallery's patron saint.

28:33.250 --> 28:35.250
- Is he here tonight?
- I hope so.

28:35.252 --> 28:37.051
After all the specific requests he made:

28:37.053 --> 28:39.053
the venue, the date...

28:39.055 --> 28:41.456
I've never seen anyone champion a
new artist's work so adamantly.

28:41.458 --> 28:43.591
Why is it a person's wealth is
always directly proportional

28:43.593 --> 28:45.192
to how high maintenance they are?

28:45.194 --> 28:47.562
Excuse me... I should really
congratulate my cousin.

28:47.564 --> 28:49.697
Of course.

28:52.234 --> 28:53.700
Is everything okay?

28:53.702 --> 28:55.369
Better than okay.

28:55.371 --> 28:57.571
It's incredible.

28:57.573 --> 28:59.706
Don't undersell your talent, darlin'.

28:59.708 --> 29:01.675
You deserve this.

29:01.677 --> 29:03.944
How we doing?

29:03.946 --> 29:07.248
Time to break into the
emergency stash of Prosecco.

29:07.250 --> 29:10.984
Typical art gallery booze hounds.

29:10.986 --> 29:12.519
Any chance you could help?

29:13.921 --> 29:15.389
- Of course.
- Great.

29:18.693 --> 29:22.195
Ah, finally. A moment alone.

29:22.197 --> 29:23.764
We should toast to this.

29:23.766 --> 29:25.231
What, with air champagne?

29:25.233 --> 29:26.699
Yeah, I'll go get the real stuff.

29:34.641 --> 29:38.044
<i>Well, if it isn't
my little rabbit.</i>

29:38.046 --> 29:40.813
<i>Can you twitch your nose</i>
<i>like a rabbit, Elena?</i>

29:42.283 --> 29:43.882
<i>You can!</i>

29:43.884 --> 29:45.384
<i>You want to come inside?</i>

29:45.386 --> 29:47.151
<i>I've got more rabbits in there.</i>

29:52.558 --> 29:54.225
I don't understand.

29:56.395 --> 29:58.463
Who bit you?

29:58.465 --> 30:01.232
You afraid of the big bad wolf?

30:01.234 --> 30:02.467
Hm?

30:07.757 --> 30:09.160
Victor Olson.

30:09.168 --> 30:10.400
You've changed a little

30:10.402 --> 30:11.735
since the last time I saw you,

30:11.737 --> 30:13.236
but then again, so have I.

30:13.238 --> 30:16.106
Turns out we're not
so different after all.

30:16.108 --> 30:17.841
Please, just leave.

30:17.843 --> 30:21.044
You're still just a scared little girl.

30:21.046 --> 30:23.913
There's one thing I
always loved about you:

30:23.915 --> 30:25.482
you never put up a fight.

30:27.085 --> 30:29.152
You know, you're not
in a suit or anything,

30:29.154 --> 30:31.154
so you don't mind getting
a little dirty...

30:31.156 --> 30:33.156
This is just a little too fancy.

30:33.158 --> 30:34.924
I mean, half the time, I think they...
they make dresses

30:34.926 --> 30:36.459
so that you have to take somebody home

30:36.461 --> 30:38.360
or else how are you going
to reach the zipper, right?

30:38.362 --> 30:41.163
- I try to stick to pants.
- I like that.

30:41.165 --> 30:44.000
But this dress, I mean, I'm
probably going to have to...

30:44.002 --> 30:46.035
sleep in it.

30:46.037 --> 30:48.471
Unless... unless you want to...

30:48.473 --> 30:49.772
give me a hand...

30:51.436 --> 30:52.669
Clay?

30:54.873 --> 30:56.072
Clay?

31:08.220 --> 31:10.553
Wrong place, wrong time, Santos.

31:10.555 --> 31:13.189
What? I'm in the market
for some new art.

31:13.191 --> 31:14.290
Ow!

31:14.292 --> 31:16.326
You're supposed to be in prison.

31:16.328 --> 31:18.094
I served my time.

31:18.096 --> 31:20.630
Though I'm told your testimony
got me an extra five years.

31:20.632 --> 31:22.832
They just flew by, didn't they?

31:22.834 --> 31:24.434
What do you want?

31:24.436 --> 31:26.536
You know I've always been
a fan of yours, Elena.

31:26.538 --> 31:29.505
Ever since you used to come
and visit me next door.

31:29.507 --> 31:31.541
To play with my rabbits.

31:31.543 --> 31:35.177
But of course, you were always
my favourite pet of all.

31:42.685 --> 31:45.854
Why are you hitting me?
I'm not the one to blame.

31:45.856 --> 31:49.324
Whatever happened to Elena,
it's her own damn fault.

31:49.326 --> 31:52.428
Oh, and you should know...
she never once told me no.

31:53.864 --> 31:55.531
Philip, please, stop!

32:02.005 --> 32:03.772
Pete, Antonio...

32:03.774 --> 32:05.607
Almost killing Jeremy.

32:05.609 --> 32:08.376
I've lost track of the reasons
why I should kill you.

32:08.378 --> 32:11.245
There's nothing stopping me

32:11.247 --> 32:13.347
from ending this war right now.

32:13.349 --> 32:14.649
Clay?

32:16.453 --> 32:17.985
What's going on?

32:22.023 --> 32:24.559
I saw the guy hot-wiring a car.

32:33.868 --> 32:36.203
We should get back inside.

32:36.205 --> 32:38.405
I mean, I'm living proof

32:38.407 --> 32:40.941
that a werewolf can be
raised by a human mother.

32:40.943 --> 32:42.275
Are you?

32:42.277 --> 32:44.144
Was growing up not knowing what you were

32:44.146 --> 32:46.346
really that much better?

32:46.348 --> 32:49.116
To suddenly just find out at 16,

32:49.118 --> 32:53.220
no preparation, no sense of history.

32:53.222 --> 32:56.022
You had to leave that
family behind then.

32:56.024 --> 32:58.091
- Was that easy?
- No.

32:58.093 --> 33:02.028
- But I came around.
- Don't downplay it, man.

33:02.030 --> 33:04.397
The longer that child stays with Rachel,

33:04.399 --> 33:06.065
the harder it'll be on all of you.

33:07.567 --> 33:09.702
Maybe.

33:09.704 --> 33:14.874
But at least I had the benefit
of being raised by my mother.

33:14.876 --> 33:17.276
All I know is my son deserves the same.

33:17.278 --> 33:19.612
And that's exactly what
I'm going to tell Jeremy.

33:24.284 --> 33:26.418
My father refused to talk
about my mother.

33:26.420 --> 33:28.320
But he never stopped loving her.

33:30.257 --> 33:32.625
He made that sacrifice because he knew

33:32.627 --> 33:35.127
he could not raise me without
the support of the Pack.

33:35.129 --> 33:37.029
And if she knew the truth about us,

33:37.031 --> 33:38.463
he'd have to kill her.

33:38.465 --> 33:40.331
Jeremy may feel different.

33:40.333 --> 33:43.902
But to me, what you're
going through right now

33:43.904 --> 33:46.571
is exactly why these rules exist.

33:55.247 --> 33:57.748
Are you telling me
you never think about her?

34:07.393 --> 34:08.626
Ahh...

34:14.465 --> 34:15.666
Vanilla...

34:15.668 --> 34:18.902
Why did the Mutts
go to your house, Joey?

34:18.905 --> 34:21.038
Santos told us he was
going after the Pack.

34:21.040 --> 34:23.607
He wanted to know who we
were going to side with.

34:23.609 --> 34:25.342
What'd your father say?

34:25.344 --> 34:27.377
My father said we weren't anybody's side.

34:27.379 --> 34:29.913
But he was just trying
to save his own life.

34:29.915 --> 34:32.782
He's always been with the Pack,
you know that, just like me.

34:32.784 --> 34:34.650
I don't know that.

34:34.652 --> 34:36.320
You've got to believe me, Jeremy.

34:36.322 --> 34:38.722
I want to believe you, Joey.

34:38.724 --> 34:42.592
I want to believe you, but the
fact is, the Mutts spared you.

34:42.594 --> 34:44.828
How do I know you didn't make a deal?

34:44.830 --> 34:46.929
How do I know you're
not working with them?

34:46.931 --> 34:51.567
I would never work with those bastards.
They killed my father.

34:51.569 --> 34:54.603
This isn't some move, Jeremy.

34:54.606 --> 34:56.371
All right? I swear to God!

34:56.373 --> 34:58.942
He's telling the truth
about the Mutts' hideout.

34:58.944 --> 35:00.909
You said it smelled like vanilla, right?

35:02.946 --> 35:05.948
It's a bottle of whisky my dad
brought back from Aberdeen.

35:05.950 --> 35:08.317
I remember him telling
me that as whisky ages,

35:08.319 --> 35:10.119
part of it evaporates.

35:10.121 --> 35:12.154
And over the years, that vapour
would seep into the wood

35:12.156 --> 35:15.924
and would give these factories a
very sweet, vanilla-like smell.

35:15.926 --> 35:19.361
During Prohibition, there were a number
of illegal distilleries in this area.

35:21.297 --> 35:23.632
If we can find the right one,

35:23.634 --> 35:25.400
then we will find the Mutts.

35:31.340 --> 35:32.507
Philip?

35:32.509 --> 35:33.775
I took care of it.

35:33.777 --> 35:35.143
Took care of what?

35:35.145 --> 35:37.712
There was this, uh, this
creep from my childhood.

35:37.714 --> 35:39.981
He... I guess he just got out of jail.

35:39.983 --> 35:41.349
He must've tracked down my name

35:41.351 --> 35:44.352
- and saw the press for the show.
- Who?

35:44.354 --> 35:47.088
- Victor Olson.
- Did he hurt you? - No, no.

35:47.090 --> 35:49.758
- We should get you home.
- I'll get our things.

35:54.496 --> 35:56.630
I should've been here.

35:56.632 --> 35:59.433
Santos was waiting outside,
the bastards got away.

35:59.435 --> 36:01.368
We can't leave her alone tonight.

36:03.706 --> 36:07.508
If they turned Olson, this has
to do with you, not Rachel.

36:07.510 --> 36:09.643
What is this?

36:09.645 --> 36:12.313
Unleashing Olson, sending
the video to Philip?

36:12.315 --> 36:14.315
Philip's client, James Williams?

36:14.317 --> 36:16.317
He's the top patron of this gallery.

36:16.319 --> 36:19.820
He sponsored your show, Elena.

36:19.822 --> 36:23.824
- Just to get us here.
- To drop Olson in your lap.

36:23.826 --> 36:25.358
Who would do that?

36:25.360 --> 36:28.494
Someone who knows exactly
who and what we are.

36:28.496 --> 36:31.130
I'm not leaving your side.

36:31.132 --> 36:33.632
I'm not leaving Toronto.

36:33.634 --> 36:36.268
Not until we figure out
who James Williams is.

36:56.292 --> 36:58.116
Elena, talk to me.

37:03.255 --> 37:07.891
There are people that
want to hurt my family.

37:07.893 --> 37:09.960
Bad people.

37:09.962 --> 37:12.530
I'm pretty sure Olson showing up today

37:12.532 --> 37:14.865
had something to do with that.

37:14.867 --> 37:18.535
That's why I've been going
home so much to help them.

37:20.705 --> 37:23.807
What about your cousin
Danielle and the car accident?

37:26.511 --> 37:29.613
There is no cousin Danielle.

37:29.615 --> 37:31.881
No car accident.

37:31.883 --> 37:35.252
And Logan? And Clay?

37:35.254 --> 37:38.321
Are they... are they even your cousins?

37:46.297 --> 37:50.767
My family in New York aren't...

37:50.769 --> 37:52.669
my family by blood.

37:55.372 --> 37:59.375
But Jeremy's the closest thing
I've ever had to a father,

37:59.377 --> 38:03.212
and my cousins are the closest thing
I've ever had to a real family.

38:03.214 --> 38:05.747
It feels targeted against her, Jeremy.

38:07.083 --> 38:09.418
Okay. We'll stay put until you get here.

38:10.921 --> 38:13.289
<i>But that was all
before I met you, okay?</i>

38:13.291 --> 38:15.558
<i>Now, I've been trying to distance
myself from them ever since,</i>

38:15.560 --> 38:17.560
<i>and everything that they represent.</i>

38:17.562 --> 38:20.295
<i>If that's true, then
why bring Clay back here?</i>

38:20.297 --> 38:22.030
<i>It's the last thing that I wanted,</i>

38:22.032 --> 38:24.099
<i>but I didn't have a choice.</i>

38:24.101 --> 38:26.702
<i>I just don't want you getting
involved with any of this...</i>

38:42.751 --> 38:45.620
Smells like they've been
gone for at least a day.

38:49.725 --> 38:52.594
Doesn't look like they
deserted the place though.

38:52.596 --> 38:54.294
This...

38:55.964 --> 38:57.464
This is where they kept me.

39:01.469 --> 39:03.604
That's where they had me tied up.

39:05.440 --> 39:08.609
That's where that Mutt beat me.

39:12.447 --> 39:13.847
Let's search this place.

39:13.849 --> 39:16.015
Look for anything that can be useful.

39:16.017 --> 39:18.585
We need to figure out their next move.

39:26.160 --> 39:28.061
My life here with you, that's...

39:28.063 --> 39:30.130
that's the life that I want.

39:32.699 --> 39:34.667
You have to believe me, Philip.

39:37.271 --> 39:39.739
What about Clay?

39:39.741 --> 39:43.709
Jeremy sent him to protect me.

39:43.711 --> 39:46.712
Didn't I prove to you tonight
that I can protect you?

39:46.714 --> 39:49.582
Of course you did, and if it were
up to me, he wouldn't be here.

39:49.584 --> 39:51.751
Yet here he is, sleeping on our couch.

39:51.753 --> 39:53.552
I see the way he looks at you.

39:53.554 --> 39:55.220
I see the way you are together.

39:55.222 --> 39:58.291
I saw the goddamn photo
at Logan's, Elena.

39:58.293 --> 40:00.492
But that was from years ago.

40:00.494 --> 40:02.427
And what about right now?

40:02.429 --> 40:05.264
Here, in this moment,

40:05.266 --> 40:08.466
tell me honestly,

40:08.468 --> 40:10.402
are you done with him?

40:47.105 --> 40:49.973
This was my father's.

40:49.975 --> 40:52.509
It was Pete's lighter.

40:57.582 --> 41:00.384
Santos is a trophy collector.

41:10.562 --> 41:12.495
I found something over here.

41:17.268 --> 41:19.402
I found something too.

41:19.404 --> 41:20.603
What is it?

41:20.605 --> 41:23.105
It was my father's ring.

41:23.107 --> 41:25.174
He used to wear it all the time.

41:25.176 --> 41:27.477
How'd they get Malcolm's ring?

41:27.479 --> 41:30.646
Someone would have to pry that
out of his cold, dead finger.

41:30.648 --> 41:33.349
Yeah, I think that's
exactly what happened.

41:33.351 --> 41:35.585
'Kay, you need to see this.

41:47.531 --> 41:49.431
They've been watching us.

41:49.433 --> 41:52.902
In Toronto. I have
to get back to Rachel.

41:56.138 --> 41:58.172
She's pregnant.

41:58.174 --> 41:59.941
We're going to have a son.

42:03.746 --> 42:05.914
I came to the house to tell you.

42:05.916 --> 42:07.282
Huh...

42:08.584 --> 42:11.152
Go. Find her.

42:15.024 --> 42:16.490
Philip, let's talk.

42:16.492 --> 42:18.559
Everything you've told
me has been a lie.

42:19.895 --> 42:21.796
Please, don't do this.

42:21.798 --> 42:25.199
I can't be with somebody I don't trust.

42:25.201 --> 42:28.436
Trust... I don't even know you.

42:33.775 --> 42:36.644
It's not just you the Mutts are after.

42:36.646 --> 42:37.945
Clay was right.

42:41.316 --> 42:43.183
It's Elena.
