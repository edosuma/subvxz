00:17.142 --> 00:18.477
You have to help me!

00:18.477 --> 00:20.062
Mal:
What's the emergency?

00:20.062 --> 00:21.522
‐This!
‐Cupcakes?

00:21.522 --> 00:23.440
I volunteered to make
cupcakes for the carnival

00:23.440 --> 00:27.152
because I heard that last year
everyone loved Audrey's.

00:27.152 --> 00:29.279
They were, like,
an explosion of deliciousness.

00:29.279 --> 00:32.157
And I thought, "I can do that
and everyone will love me

00:32.157 --> 00:34.159
and tell me
how fab‐mazing I am,"

00:34.159 --> 00:35.369
but none of that
is going to happen

00:35.369 --> 00:37.162
because I can't make cupcakes!

00:37.162 --> 00:38.372
I mean, it's not like
I made cupcakes

00:38.372 --> 00:39.373
on the Isle of the Lost,

00:39.373 --> 00:41.124
the evil minion bakers did.

00:41.124 --> 00:43.418
Remember the awesome ones
we had at my birthday parties?

00:43.418 --> 00:45.128
I wasn't invited.

00:45.128 --> 00:47.422
That's because that was
a mean thing to do

00:47.422 --> 00:51.176
and on the Isle of the Lost
being mean was being nice.

00:51.176 --> 00:52.177
Uh‐huh.

00:52.177 --> 00:54.346
What exactly did
you fill these with?

00:54.346 --> 00:56.390
They say baking
is a form of chemistry,

00:56.390 --> 00:59.434
so I decided to combine
all of the periodic elements.

00:59.434 --> 01:02.479
I probably should have
left out the sulfur.

01:02.479 --> 01:03.563
You have to help me!

01:03.563 --> 01:05.440
‐Use your magic!
‐No way.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.317
I'm trying to be good,
remember?

01:07.317 --> 01:10.237
Magic for a good cause
is automatically good.

01:10.237 --> 01:12.197
I don't think
it really works that way.

01:12.197 --> 01:14.283
Please, please, please, please,
please, please, please, please,

01:14.283 --> 01:16.535
‐please, please, please...
‐You're not gonna stop
until I help you, are you?

01:16.535 --> 01:19.329
Yep. Please, please, please,
please, please, please, please,

01:19.329 --> 01:21.248
‐please‐‐
‐Okay, okay! Fine!

01:21.248 --> 01:23.417
I'll do it,
but just this once.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.168
Oh, Magic Spellbook...

01:25.168 --> 01:27.462
I've always wondered
what unnilseptium tasted like.

01:27.462 --> 01:31.300
‐make no haste
and turn Evie's cupcakes...
‐Ew!

01:31.300 --> 01:34.136
‐into an explosion of‐‐
‐(boom)

01:34.136 --> 01:35.554
What happened?

01:35.554 --> 01:37.389
You didn't let
me finish the spell!

01:37.389 --> 01:39.182
Instead of
an explosion of taste,

01:39.182 --> 01:41.435
we made
an explosion of...

01:41.435 --> 01:42.477
cupcakes.
