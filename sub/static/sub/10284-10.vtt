WEBVTT

00:03.916 --> 00:05.269
Previously on ER:

00:05.273 --> 00:06.490
There is no settlement.

00:06.500 --> 00:10.782
We agreed to the meeting as a show of
good faith in case we went back to trial.

00:10.787 --> 00:15.567
See the initials? C.A. Curtis Ames.
I think he's trying to threaten us.

00:15.575 --> 00:17.204
Do you want to talk about
what's bugging you?

00:17.254 --> 00:20.366
I thought I'd be reporting
on topical medical issues

00:20.377 --> 00:24.070
not doing puff pieces on Botox
and unsanitary manicures.

00:24.077 --> 00:26.383
- Luka, this is... Eddie.
- Eddie.

00:26.721 --> 00:29.209
- Uh, you're the husband?
- Oh, my God.

00:29.568 --> 00:31.230
Meg, Sarah, this is Neela.

00:33.084 --> 00:34.073
Hey, Greg.

00:34.083 --> 00:35.936
Can a straight guy go
through a gay phase?

00:35.945 --> 00:39.620
I think it's more likely that he's gay.

00:46.779 --> 00:48.920
Oh. That's what I like to see.

00:48.937 --> 00:51.642
A brother taking his education seriously.
What you got here?

00:51.656 --> 00:55.033
Art History final today.
We pulled an all-nighter.

00:55.248 --> 00:57.192
- We?
- Chaz, do you have an extra toothbrush

00:57.198 --> 00:58.803
I can borrow?

00:59.506 --> 01:02.833
Oh. Hi. I'm Nicole.

01:04.155 --> 01:05.643
This is my brother, Greg.

01:06.106 --> 01:08.840
- Morning.
- Nic's my study partner.

01:08.976 --> 01:11.523
She lives on campus
and it got a little late...

01:11.537 --> 01:14.822
- I hope we didn't make too much noise.
- Well, I didn't hear a thing.

01:16.898 --> 01:19.732
Tongue stuck in bowling ball,
waiting on a drill...

01:19.886 --> 01:23.673
Bedbug couple, 1% hydrocortisone.
Probably need an exterminator, too.

01:23.687 --> 01:27.201
Those critters are nasty. Sleep-eater
guy wants a prescription for a padlock.

01:27.275 --> 01:29.351
- For his refrigerator.
- Hey, Ray.

01:29.378 --> 01:31.703
Patient in 3 is ready for transfer.
How do we do that?

01:31.717 --> 01:34.092
- What about belly pain in 2?
- Small bowel obstruction.

01:34.105 --> 01:36.763
You need to fill out a transfer packet...

01:36.775 --> 01:39.530
to document the reason for transfer and

01:39.545 --> 01:42.561
consent for transfer
and stability for transfer.

01:42.576 --> 01:45.970
If you don't do this, then it's an
EMTALA violation and a big fine.

01:45.987 --> 01:48.281
- Got it.
- So, uh...

01:49.136 --> 01:50.510
We're okay, right?

01:50.757 --> 01:53.072
Yeah, these look pretty self-explanatory.

01:53.087 --> 01:55.442
I mean about keeping you
and me under wraps.

01:55.457 --> 01:58.463
Gets out that we're dating, it could
get weird around here... for you.

01:58.467 --> 02:00.262
- Oh, for me?
- Uh-huh.

02:00.407 --> 02:04.122
- You two make such a cute couple.
- What? Her and me?

02:04.137 --> 02:05.380
No, we're not...

02:05.858 --> 02:08.521
- Dr. Weaver, what should I...
- Uh, sorry, you got to talk to Morris.

02:08.525 --> 02:11.363
- I'm due at the station.
- You must be excited about tonight.

02:11.377 --> 02:12.682
Tonight?
What's tonight?

02:12.698 --> 02:15.422
Dr. Weaver's special report
on the Channel 5 News.

02:15.948 --> 02:17.162
Hey, everybody.

02:17.177 --> 02:20.502
This is Ben Parker. He's a new RN,
all the way in from Savannah.

02:20.515 --> 02:23.293
- Hi, Ben. Hello. Hi.
- It's nice to meet y'all.

02:23.807 --> 02:25.342
Looks like we got ourselves
a Southern boy.

02:25.346 --> 02:27.300
- Yeah, a real Georgia peach.
- Hey !

02:27.315 --> 02:29.652
Since it's his first shift,
let's try not to scare him off.

02:29.665 --> 02:31.852
We need him to come back tomorrow.

02:33.007 --> 02:35.243
20 says Gentle Ben doesn't last a week.

02:35.255 --> 02:38.732
- I give him five days.
- Three, we'll make it 40.

02:39.378 --> 02:40.391
What's up, man?

02:40.488 --> 02:42.903
- Hey, Kerry, you on today?
- Not anymore.

02:43.948 --> 02:47.392
- All right, what am I walking into?
- Uh, we got slammed at midnight.

02:47.406 --> 02:49.533
- But we're under control now.
- Good.

02:49.545 --> 02:51.012
Hey. Hey.

02:51.415 --> 02:53.741
Uh, I just wanted to say thanks
for the advice the other day,

02:53.755 --> 02:56.593
but I'm happy to let you know,
you got it wrong this time.

02:56.605 --> 02:57.770
- Advice?
- Yeah.

02:57.777 --> 03:00.603
As it turns out not everyone
who experiments is gay.

03:00.616 --> 03:01.721
Excuse me?

03:02.087 --> 03:04.092
Talking about my brother Chaz.

03:04.597 --> 03:07.011
It was like he said: It's just a phase.

03:07.035 --> 03:08.862
- Is that so?
- Yep.

03:08.998 --> 03:11.823
Hey, you remember that girl
he took home for Thanksgiving?

03:11.837 --> 03:13.073
Well...

03:14.006 --> 03:15.632
She spent the night.

03:15.987 --> 03:17.631
My brother's straight.

03:17.968 --> 03:20.693
Gee, Greg, you must be so proud.

03:22.026 --> 03:23.430
What? No, that's not...

03:23.698 --> 03:26.010
That's not what I meant.
What I meant was, uh...

03:27.986 --> 03:29.951
Uh, you, you know what I meant.

03:30.857 --> 03:33.992
Yeah. And you're not
my only black friend.

03:35.307 --> 03:40.093
Joe, next time try eating your apricots
not throwing them.

03:40.105 --> 03:42.260
Hey, do you think this is funny?

03:42.536 --> 03:45.123
So the budget committee's
pressuring you that much?

03:45.675 --> 03:49.313
Yeah, and girls don't like when
you wear your food. Trust me.

03:49.327 --> 03:51.750
Yeah, they're all over me about it.

03:52.048 --> 03:53.732
How much they want you to cut?

03:55.277 --> 03:57.363
They want me to cut an attending.

03:57.378 --> 04:00.811
- What? That's crazy.
- Yep.

04:00.828 --> 04:03.093
This is between me, you and Joe.

04:03.107 --> 04:05.003
Hey. Hi.

04:05.506 --> 04:09.113
What's it like out there? Is it too cold
for Joe to go to the park today?

04:09.928 --> 04:12.710
I can't believe they want you
to cut an attending.

04:12.787 --> 04:16.829
How does the budget committee
expect us to do our job when...

04:16.845 --> 04:19.899
Luka?
Hey! Luka.

05:04.556 --> 05:06.743
What is up with you today?
You're acting so weird.

05:06.758 --> 05:08.562
You running out of the house
without any shoes on,

05:08.568 --> 05:10.282
- without a jacket...
- I saw a tow truck.

05:10.287 --> 05:13.540
And I thought my car was parked
on the wrong side of the street.

05:13.557 --> 05:16.820
What, they don't have alternate-side
of-the-street parking in Croatia?

05:16.938 --> 05:19.583
Danielle Davis, 13, unresponsive
with heavy vaginal bleeding.

05:19.598 --> 05:22.180
- BP: 90/60 in the field, up with a liter.
- What happened?

05:22.195 --> 05:24.381
Somebody found her down
the front steps of her school.

05:24.405 --> 05:27.080
- Danielle, open your eyes. Danielle.
- What is it?

05:27.107 --> 05:28.923
Syncope, head trauma with a vag bleed.

05:28.935 --> 05:32.282
Or it's an ectopic pregnancy and
she's bleeding out. I'll clear a room.

05:33.115 --> 05:35.830
Hang on, Danielle.
We're going to take good care of you.

05:36.858 --> 05:39.610
Well, you may have torn a ligament.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.892
Looks like a case of boomeritis.

05:42.906 --> 05:45.230
- Uh, that sounds bad.
- Okay.

05:45.705 --> 05:49.033
Mr. Pacheco, you better warm up
before working out,

05:49.056 --> 05:52.132
and you might want to consider taking up
swimming or bike riding instead.

05:52.407 --> 05:55.991
He's going to need a knee immobilizer,
crutches and Vicodin.

05:57.356 --> 05:59.621
Boomeritis?
You come up with that?

06:00.765 --> 06:03.031
Hey, Morris, I'm going to need
you to sign off on this.

06:03.045 --> 06:07.250
- Probable ACL tear.
- So how's Katey working out?

06:07.266 --> 06:08.413
Uh, who?

06:09.505 --> 06:12.673
- Katey. Aren't you supervising her?
- Oh, no, not me.

06:12.998 --> 06:16.441
Hey, is it me or do the med students
keep getting younger every year?

06:16.445 --> 06:18.561
- What's she like? 24?
- Uh, I don't know.

06:18.578 --> 06:20.240
I've never noticed how hot she is.

06:20.256 --> 06:21.852
- What?
- What?

06:21.877 --> 06:23.542
I didn't say anything
about her being hot.

06:23.555 --> 06:25.123
- I mean she is hot, but...
- Ah, well.

06:25.136 --> 06:27.341
You have to be certified
as an MICN in order to take,

06:27.357 --> 06:30.320
uh, radio calls, but in the meantime
you can use it to do status check.

06:30.327 --> 06:32.340
Somebody get an ortho referral
on my knee guy in Curtain 2?

06:32.357 --> 06:33.913
- Yeah, I'll take it.
- Thank you.

06:34.216 --> 06:36.020
There's a new course starting next month.
I'll get you the details.

06:36.037 --> 06:37.150
Sounds great.
Thank you.

06:37.166 --> 06:39.642
Hey, Dawn, is the white count back
on my gallstone guy in Curtain 3?

06:39.657 --> 06:42.832
10.8. All right.
He needs another four of morphine. Here.

06:42.845 --> 06:45.472
- Sure, I'll get to it in a minute.
- Whoa, whoa, Hope,

06:45.915 --> 06:49.753
about your newlyweds with flu symptoms,
why would you prescribe

06:50.227 --> 06:52.412
"Long walks, holding hands
and romantic dinners."

06:52.427 --> 06:55.223
Oh, um, I sensed tension
in their young marriage

06:55.237 --> 06:57.561
and when we're tense or stressed,
our immune systems weaken,

06:57.578 --> 07:02.512
which as you know, limits our body's
ability to fight off infections and viruses.

07:04.815 --> 07:11.412
I felt if, uh, Andy and Phyllis
carved out more time for one another,

07:11.426 --> 07:13.383
they could strengthen
their marriage, thus...

07:13.406 --> 07:16.420
speeding their recovery and protecting
them from future illnesses.

07:16.435 --> 07:18.960
- Oh, you can't...
- Bitch, it's mine, and I want it.

07:18.978 --> 07:22.021
Come on now; you stole it,
and I want it back. Now!

07:22.026 --> 07:23.741
Sir, you're going to have
to calm down, okay?

07:23.757 --> 07:26.030
This guy has been acting up
since he got here.

07:26.045 --> 07:27.803
Sir, what are you missing?

07:27.806 --> 07:31.360
When I came in here, I had
a five-carat ring in my pocket.

07:31.374 --> 07:34.913
And now it's gone.
And this bitch stole it. Come here.

07:34.923 --> 07:37.816
- And give me my ring.
- Hey, hey, hey.

07:37.905 --> 07:40.340
You shut your piehole
and you come with me.

07:42.179 --> 07:45.123
- You okay, Hope?
- Yes. Thank goodness for Ben.

07:45.135 --> 07:47.311
Yeah, he really took charge.
You can say that again.

07:47.328 --> 07:48.823
All right, come on, come on.
Let's break it up, all right?

07:48.836 --> 07:51.580
All right, get back to work.
Not a big deal. Please.

07:52.625 --> 07:54.532
I think we just got shown up
by a "murse."

07:54.546 --> 07:56.222
- Huh?
- A male nurse.

07:56.235 --> 08:01.120
- Oh, that's bad.
- Yeah. He's pretty macho, though, huh?

08:03.905 --> 08:05.971
Pupils four millimeters and reactive.

08:05.995 --> 08:10.783
Contusions and lacerations to the labia.
CBC, coags, type and cross.

08:10.797 --> 08:13.910
- She was assaulted.
- Pregnancy test is negative.

08:13.928 --> 08:16.802
Okay. Let's get her to CT
to rule out brain injury.

08:16.817 --> 08:19.150
I'll check on CT and notify OB.

08:19.685 --> 08:22.593
- C-spine's clear.
- When is she going to be able to talk?

08:22.928 --> 08:26.483
- I don't know.
- Her clothes need to be inventoried.

08:26.495 --> 08:29.931
Of course. Okay let's use Dermabond
to fix this forehead lac.

08:29.955 --> 08:32.760
- She probably hit her head on the school steps.
- Scanner's ready in 20 minutes.

08:32.775 --> 08:34.730
Trying to run away from whoever did this.

08:34.735 --> 08:36.440
20 minutes, that's not good enough.

08:36.455 --> 08:38.361
Gates, surgery is down
on your belly pain consult.

08:38.376 --> 08:41.011
- I'll get there when I can.
- We're okay here. Gates, go.

08:41.595 --> 08:44.720
Hi, this is Dr. Kovac.
Put her on a portable monitor.

08:45.127 --> 08:47.610
- I'm going to go call this in.
- I've got an unconscious kid down here;

08:47.637 --> 08:49.980
- clear the scanner.
- There's a Mrs. Arrida out here.

08:49.985 --> 08:52.593
- She's from the girl's school.
- Okay. Okay!

08:53.366 --> 08:54.760
Timmy, we're going to need
an evidence bag.

08:54.768 --> 08:55.833
Sure thing, Doc.

08:55.855 --> 08:58.812
I'm the Vice Principal at Lakeside
Academy. How is Danielle?

08:58.827 --> 09:01.432
Uh, she's not very well right now.

09:01.978 --> 09:03.831
- Oh, my God.
- Please.

09:05.617 --> 09:09.081
- Do you know what happened?
- No, no one saw anything.

09:09.088 --> 09:11.372
We've never had anything
like this at Lakeside.

09:11.387 --> 09:13.353
Okay, what about her parents?
Have they been notified?

09:13.356 --> 09:16.152
The school nurse called, but had to leave messages.

09:16.167 --> 09:18.441
- Okay, they need to be here.
- Danielle's mother is here.

09:18.456 --> 09:20.811
- She works at County.
- What's her name?

09:21.005 --> 09:23.672
Gilliam. Angela Gilliam.

09:24.437 --> 09:26.711
What makes you think
it's a small bowel obstruction?

09:26.717 --> 09:30.020
Abdominal pain, distension,
no bowel movement for three days.

09:30.845 --> 09:33.170
There's no history of abdominal
surgery, no adhesions.

09:33.185 --> 09:35.481
He's too young for a colon lesion.
Upright?

09:39.285 --> 09:41.721
How's that?
That better?

09:41.736 --> 09:45.451
Air-fluid levels, but no dilated loops.
Not consistent with obstruction.

09:45.467 --> 09:49.592
Well, you can't be sure, you know. Sometimes
things aren't always the way they seem.

09:50.046 --> 09:51.890
-Listen, about the other night...
- Stop.

09:52.186 --> 09:54.873
It's over.
I told Meg it's over.

09:54.908 --> 09:57.671
Maybe for you, but any idiot
could see from the look on her face

09:57.688 --> 09:59.552
that it's not over for her.

10:01.995 --> 10:04.522
It's an ileus.
The bowel's asleep.

10:04.535 --> 10:06.740
Doesn't help that he's been
popping Vicodin four times a day.

10:06.756 --> 10:09.110
Just give him a laxative
and wait for him to poop.

10:10.105 --> 10:13.440
That's ileus-- I-L-E-U-S.

10:18.985 --> 10:21.811
My assistant pulled me out of a staff
meeting. What's the emergency?

10:21.825 --> 10:24.853
- There's a patient in Trauma 1.
- Okay, let's go.

10:24.867 --> 10:28.003
- We couldn't discuss this on the phone?
- Look, we don't know what happened.

10:28.018 --> 10:31.713
- They found her outside of her school.
- Luka, what's going on?

10:33.485 --> 10:36.563
- We think she was sexually assaulted.
- Who?

10:37.055 --> 10:40.441
Uh... Angela, it's Danielle.

10:50.305 --> 10:52.093
My baby.

10:53.808 --> 10:56.043
My sweet baby girl!

11:11.885 --> 11:15.783
Okay, truly, and you explain to me
how this happened?

11:15.796 --> 11:18.711
Well, Wes-- that's my boyfriend--
he's always talking on his cell,

11:18.726 --> 11:20.952
but when I'd ask, "Who are you calling?
Who are you talking to?"

11:20.965 --> 11:22.772
he gets all secretive on me.

11:22.905 --> 11:26.311
- Does your old man do that to you?
- No, my old man's pretty cool.

11:26.327 --> 11:29.313
Lucky-- anyways, me and Wes
are in bed, and his cell rings,

11:29.315 --> 11:31.580
so I rolled over and grabbed it
before he could.

11:31.596 --> 11:33.510
- That's pretty smart, huh?
- Very smart.

11:33.525 --> 11:36.170
Anyways, Wes gets all mad, starts
chasing me around the room,

11:36.176 --> 11:39.560
and I see that it's "Debbie" calling.
So I say, "Who the hell is Debbie?"

11:39.578 --> 11:41.800
He tells me it's none
of my damn business.

11:41.927 --> 11:44.700
And that's when you decided
to swallow his cell phone.

11:46.156 --> 11:48.590
Okay, I'm going to order an X-ray

11:48.736 --> 11:51.803
and we'll find out if we can
pull it out here in the ER.

11:51.816 --> 11:55.172
- If not, you're going to need surgery.
- Oh, it's one of those real tiny ones.

11:55.185 --> 11:57.383
I could stick my finger down
my throat to try to barf it up.

11:57.395 --> 11:59.872
- Hey, Abby, you got a sec?
- Hold that thought.

12:00.168 --> 12:02.971
- This is Ben Parker, new RN.
- Hi. Abby Lockhart.

12:02.986 --> 12:05.563
Hi. Abby, you're the nurse
that became a doctor, right?

12:05.565 --> 12:08.341
- Yeah, guilty as charged.
- Got seduced by the dark side, huh?

12:08.345 --> 12:10.641
Well, I use my powers for good, not evil.

12:10.837 --> 12:14.491
- Abby's an R3 now.
- Nice to meet you.

12:14.836 --> 12:16.552
Oh, I forgot.

12:17.117 --> 12:19.931
There's an asthmatic
at Triage asking for you.

12:22.316 --> 12:23.651
Hi.

12:23.675 --> 12:26.782
Okay, uh, I'll be back when GI gets here.

12:28.446 --> 12:30.131
- What is it?
- You hear that?

12:30.767 --> 12:33.701
It's probably that stupid
bitch Debbie calling.

12:40.508 --> 12:43.470
- Sounds pretty wheezy.
- It's been worse.

12:43.485 --> 12:46.952
- How long you been off your medication?
- Since my prescription ran out.

12:46.966 --> 12:50.380
And that was when?
60 of prednisone PO.

12:51.197 --> 12:52.781
You giving me steroids?

12:53.126 --> 12:57.383
Yes, we're sorry, but only for five days
to knock down the inflammation.

12:57.395 --> 13:01.210
And something tells me that...
you didn't get your flu shot.

13:01.707 --> 13:03.390
I'll add that to the orders.

13:03.785 --> 13:05.122
How's your buddy?

13:06.405 --> 13:08.821
You know your friend here, at County?
You going to visit him?

13:08.837 --> 13:11.930
- Better. Yeah, he's doing better.
- Good.

13:12.565 --> 13:14.691
You'd be doing better
if you quit smoking.

13:14.705 --> 13:16.290
Killjoy.

13:17.266 --> 13:20.832
- You two ever smoke?
- I did, but I gave it up.

13:21.186 --> 13:22.633
Miss it?

13:26.588 --> 13:28.332
Hey, you work here, too.

13:28.645 --> 13:31.632
- Small world.
- Yeah, hi. Uh, can I talk to you?

13:31.648 --> 13:34.092
- I need you in Trauma 1 now.
- Sure.

13:34.105 --> 13:36.570
Can I get a chest X-ray, PA and lateral.

13:36.628 --> 13:38.800
- And I'll be back.
- Yeah, you got it.

13:38.988 --> 13:42.671
I need you to do a rape exam on that girl
we brought in this morning.

13:42.798 --> 13:46.500
- She's Angela Gilliam's daughter.
- Oh, God. How's Angela?

13:46.517 --> 13:50.022
- Keeping it together, just barely.
- Okay, I'll find you when I'm done.

13:50.508 --> 13:53.343
- Officer Hollis? You have a minute?
- Sure, doc.

13:53.356 --> 13:55.560
Maybe we can get some coffee sometime.

13:55.925 --> 13:57.642
- Can we talk outside?
- Sure.

13:57.658 --> 13:58.970
- What do you think?
- Maybe.

13:58.986 --> 14:01.102
Don't tell me I don't have it.
I've read all about it!

14:01.117 --> 14:02.580
Okay, well, then you should know, then...

14:02.595 --> 14:03.992
- Fecal leukocytes negative.
- All right, thanks.

14:04.007 --> 14:06.393
There are no known cases
of avian flu in the US.

14:06.407 --> 14:08.681
Maybe I'm the first.
I demand you give me Tamiflu.

14:08.685 --> 14:10.793
You have no flu-like symptoms--
no fever, no cough.

14:10.806 --> 14:13.042
I've been in direct contact
with questionable poultry.

14:13.057 --> 14:16.072
You cannot contract avian flu
from eating take-out chicken chow mein.

14:16.088 --> 14:19.671
- What caused my diarrhea?
- It could be a stomach virus,

14:19.685 --> 14:22.791
- food poisoning...
- And avian flu virus does not cause diarrhea.

14:22.808 --> 14:24.562
Viruses mutate.
It happens all the time.

14:24.566 --> 14:28.880
Okay. Dawn, get Ms. Martinelli
two of Loperamide, QID, PRN,

14:28.896 --> 14:31.612
and dispo her before
she convinces me we all have it.

14:31.628 --> 14:34.212
All right.
Katey, nice work.

14:34.226 --> 14:36.931
- I have a good teacher.
- How long you two been dating?

14:36.946 --> 14:39.671
- Uh, we're not dating.
- You're not?

14:39.967 --> 14:41.503
Mm, my bad.

14:43.976 --> 14:46.761
- It's all ready.
- Thanks, Haleh.

14:47.898 --> 14:49.912
Okay, Danielle, um...

14:51.128 --> 14:54.081
Let me explain what we're going to do.
All right?

14:54.295 --> 14:57.493
First, we're going to put
your feet in these stirrups.

14:57.917 --> 15:01.550
Then I'm going to examine you
inside with this.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.840
It's called a speculum.
It has a light in it.

15:05.796 --> 15:08.362
When the speculum is in,
I'm going to take some swabs

15:08.378 --> 15:11.910
and sweep inside, and then
I'm going to irrigate with water

15:11.927 --> 15:14.230
and remove that with a syringe.

15:14.567 --> 15:16.053
Okay?

15:16.936 --> 15:18.191
Okay.

15:19.475 --> 15:21.701
Can you scootch down towards me?

15:23.408 --> 15:24.960
A little bit more.

15:28.265 --> 15:29.853
All right, here we go.

15:41.218 --> 15:42.253
Sam.

15:42.566 --> 15:46.490
Hey, why did you blab about Katey
and me when I asked you not to?

15:46.518 --> 15:50.052
- What are you talking about?
- Everybody knows, even the patients.

15:50.068 --> 15:52.282
I didn't say anything, I swear.

15:54.128 --> 15:58.340
- Hell, man! I like this shirt.
- That's a fag shirt.

15:58.358 --> 16:00.380
Look, just cut it out, all right? No...

16:00.656 --> 16:02.720
- There's no spitting in the...
- Incoming!

16:02.736 --> 16:05.262
We got to get a mask on this guy now.

16:05.595 --> 16:07.833
Ben... ooh!
Your friend's acting up again.

16:07.847 --> 16:09.401
- Yeah, I see that.
- Up yours!

16:09.417 --> 16:11.443
Ew, who knows what kind
of diseases he has!

16:11.445 --> 16:13.711
Yeah, exactly. So don't just stand there.
Help me find a mask.

16:13.728 --> 16:16.453
No, I've seen guys like this bite
through masks before.

16:20.305 --> 16:21.532
Where'd you learn that?

16:21.547 --> 16:24.302
It's just a little parlor trick
I picked up at Savannah General.

16:24.315 --> 16:26.270
Haven't seen that one before.

16:27.378 --> 16:30.952
Can I get you some fava
beans and a nice Chianti?

16:32.206 --> 16:35.980
Dr. Morris, um, I need you
to see my patient in Curtain 1.

16:35.996 --> 16:37.210
What's the problem?

16:37.226 --> 16:39.972
- Well, he complains of a migraine, but...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:39.987 --> 16:41.690
- Did you say migraine?
- Yes, but...

16:41.707 --> 16:43.910
Hope, would you drive
a Lamborghini to a laundromat?

16:43.926 --> 16:47.051
Hitch Seabiscuit to a plow?
Have Eddie Van Halen play air guitar?

16:47.136 --> 16:49.173
No. I'm Dr. Archie Morris.
I don't do migraines.

16:49.186 --> 16:50.863
I think it's more than that.

16:52.498 --> 16:53.921
You think?

16:54.646 --> 16:57.192
Look, I don't want a restraining order.
I want him arrested.

16:57.198 --> 17:00.172
I know you're frustrated,
but Ames hasn't done anything illegal.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.872
What? So he has to hurt my family
before anyone will listen?

17:02.886 --> 17:06.720
I wouldn't worry about this guy. He's
just a poor sucker, working a crappy job.

17:06.736 --> 17:09.111
And if you pursue this,
you might piss him off for real.

17:09.126 --> 17:13.310
- Piss Ames off?
- Look, do yourself a favor: forget Ames.

17:13.337 --> 17:15.323
He's already forgotten about you.

17:16.588 --> 17:17.771
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:18.066 --> 17:21.502
The rape exam evidence for Danielle Davis
is sealed and waiting for your signature.

17:21.518 --> 17:24.200
- Just see Haleh.
- Yeah, thanks. Take it easy, doc.

17:24.246 --> 17:26.090
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

17:26.108 --> 17:28.802
Did you send Danielle's
cultures to the lab?

17:28.805 --> 17:32.243
Yeah, GC and chlamydia, and I told them to rush the vaginal washings.

17:32.246 --> 17:34.271
Okay, I better get back in.

17:40.238 --> 17:43.111
- She's still pretty agitated.
- Okay, try a mig of Ativan.

17:43.957 --> 17:47.242
- Is your daughter dating anyone?
- She's 13.

17:47.255 --> 17:50.051
You'd be surprised how young
they start these days.

17:50.657 --> 17:53.951
- Luka. My husband, Paul.
- Hi. Dr. Kovac.

17:54.165 --> 17:55.601
Was Danielle raped?

17:55.616 --> 17:58.850
Well, the initial results are negative
for the presence of sperm.

17:58.856 --> 18:00.041
Thank God.

18:00.395 --> 18:01.902
But there's something else.

18:02.615 --> 18:07.002
Well, it looks like Danielle was
assaulted with a sharp object.

18:07.025 --> 18:12.680
It appears she was cut and penetrated
repeatedly with a razor blade.

18:14.307 --> 18:17.613
- What kind of monster would do this?
- I'm so sorry.

18:17.668 --> 18:20.211
Which one of you two saw
Danielle last this morning?

18:21.065 --> 18:25.451
I usually drive her to school, but I had
an early meeting, so Paul took her.

18:25.466 --> 18:27.650
- And what time was that?
- About 7:15.

18:27.665 --> 18:30.653
Anyone see you drop Danielle off?

18:30.945 --> 18:33.452
- I don't know.
- What time did you get to work?

18:33.468 --> 18:36.353
- Do you need to do this now?
- How is that important?

18:36.685 --> 18:40.480
- Mr. Gilliam, let's step outside.
- I'm staying here with my stepdaughter.

18:40.485 --> 18:44.630
Some lunatic has cut up our daughter and
you're treating my husband like a suspect?

18:44.647 --> 18:49.120
- Mom... what's going on?
- That's enough. Come on. Outside.

18:49.136 --> 18:51.780
I know you have a job to do, but
I can't have you upsetting my patient.

18:51.788 --> 18:54.823
- That wasn't our intent.
- Paul, listen to me. Listen to me.

18:54.835 --> 18:58.871
The police want to catch whoever did
this to Danielle as much as you do.

18:58.878 --> 19:01.642
- Of course, but...
- So just go answer their questions,

19:01.706 --> 19:04.630
and then you can rejoin your family.
Please.

19:09.875 --> 19:14.110
Everything's going to be okay.
I need you talk to me.

19:14.348 --> 19:18.501
Danielle, honey,
do you know who hurt you?

19:24.046 --> 19:25.571
Yes.

19:30.766 --> 19:32.301
Then tell me.

19:33.177 --> 19:35.042
I can't.

19:36.906 --> 19:38.672
You'll be mad.

19:58.415 --> 20:00.400
Just looking at it.

20:00.408 --> 20:03.622
How'd he get it in so deep without
hitting any vital structures?

20:03.638 --> 20:05.963
Wow, he managed
to stay outside the brain,

20:05.975 --> 20:08.971
miss the internal carotid,
optic nerve and pituitary.

20:08.988 --> 20:10.180
Lucky bastard.

20:10.208 --> 20:12.340
Hey, I heard you guys had a cool case.

20:12.357 --> 20:14.381
- Is that a...
- Ice pick.

20:14.455 --> 20:16.671
What makes someone shove
an ice pick in his ear?

20:16.688 --> 20:17.710
Ran out of Q-tips?

20:17.727 --> 20:19.830
Guy was hearing voices,
wanted them to shut up.

20:19.847 --> 20:22.482
Yeah, but I wonder why
he didn't try pulling it out himself?

20:22.588 --> 20:25.781
Said the demons in his head
would get loose if he did.

20:25.997 --> 20:29.701
- Hey, is this an ER case?
- I'd say Neurosurgery.

20:29.715 --> 20:31.550
- Nah, ENT.
- Definitely Psych.

20:31.566 --> 20:33.780
I say we page 'em all.
Let 'em fight it out.

20:33.855 --> 20:35.363
Hey, where you going?
You don't you want in on this one?

20:35.365 --> 20:36.383
Nope, nope, nope, nope.

20:36.395 --> 20:39.101
I'm leaving it all in your
capable hands, Archie.

20:40.026 --> 20:44.030
Whoo. Nice move for an old dude.

20:45.715 --> 20:47.023
What's up, man?

20:47.038 --> 20:49.603
- How'd you get back here?
- I got some moves of my own.

20:49.615 --> 20:52.012
- I don't doubt that. I don't doubt that.
- So how was the art final?

20:52.026 --> 20:53.721
- It was nothing.
- Okay.

20:53.737 --> 20:56.642
- Can I talk to you about something?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, go ahead.

20:56.655 --> 21:01.191
- Is there some place a little more private?
- Uh... Yeah, come on.

21:03.708 --> 21:06.310
- If this is a bad time, man...
- No, no, it's all good, man.

21:06.315 --> 21:09.000
So, uh, does it have anything
to do with this morning?

21:09.026 --> 21:12.790
- Uh, yeah, kind of, man.
- Let me tell you something, man.

21:12.807 --> 21:16.851
You and I-- definitely brothers.
You got good taste, man. The girl is fine.

21:17.285 --> 21:19.051
- Greg, listen, I...
- Heads up.

21:19.198 --> 21:22.400
I think you got the impression, and
I kind of gave you the impression, that

21:22.418 --> 21:25.423
- something happened between me and her.
- Well, it sure looked like that to me.

21:25.437 --> 21:28.402
Nah. The truth is Nicole
and I are just friends.

21:28.415 --> 21:32.010
Man, I mean, like her and she's cool
to hang out with, but I'm not hitting it.

21:32.028 --> 21:34.581
Mmm. That's cool. It's nothing.
Trust me.

21:34.606 --> 21:36.923
- Give the girl time if that's what...
- Greg!

21:39.338 --> 21:40.682
I'm gay.

21:46.608 --> 21:49.071
I mean, you said it was just a phase.
I mean, you're 18.

21:49.106 --> 21:50.480
Come on now.
What do you...?

21:50.778 --> 21:52.370
Look, you just need to meet
some new chicks...

21:52.385 --> 21:56.522
Look, all the talk in the world about chicks
and sports isn't gonna change me.

22:05.995 --> 22:08.283
- So you were lying to me?
- No, I was lying to myself.

22:08.425 --> 22:10.983
And I'm not going to do that anymore, man.
This is my life!

22:11.906 --> 22:14.180
- And I'm sorry if it makes you hate me.
- I don't hate you.

22:14.195 --> 22:16.312
Oh, you don't hate me,
but can you deal with it?

22:16.396 --> 22:17.740
Are we still cool?

22:21.225 --> 22:23.840
Pratt, can I give your vomiting guy
another five of Compazine?

22:24.337 --> 22:26.512
Look, I-I can't do this right now.

22:27.216 --> 22:29.520
- It's okay. I can do it.
- No, no, I better.

22:29.558 --> 22:32.273
Um... look, I gotta go.

22:40.848 --> 22:43.162
- Ooh!
- Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

22:43.345 --> 22:46.882
I have a bunch of eighth graders
with gastroenteritis.

22:47.257 --> 22:50.111
Potato salad left out too long
in the cafeteria.

22:50.198 --> 22:51.510
How's it going in there?

22:51.525 --> 22:54.220
Surgery's coming down to rule out
intra-abdominal injury.

22:54.236 --> 22:58.003
Seems Danielle knows her attacker,
but won't say who it is.

22:58.228 --> 22:59.942
- What, is she protecting someone?
- I don't know.

22:59.955 --> 23:01.630
Well, what does Hollis think?

23:01.646 --> 23:03.843
- Hollis?
- Hollis, the cop.

23:04.137 --> 23:06.541
That you were talking to about Danielle.

23:07.218 --> 23:10.580
He doesn't know much more than we do.
Your bar buddy's still here.

23:10.586 --> 23:13.310
Oh, shoot.
I have my eighth graders.

23:13.328 --> 23:15.252
- No, don't worry. I'll take care of him.
- Thank you.

23:15.268 --> 23:17.511
He's had a couple of treatments
for asthma exacerbation,

23:17.518 --> 23:19.651
but if you clear him, you can send him
home with Albuterol and Prednisone

23:19.666 --> 23:22.242
- and I'll have Sam bring in the X-rays.
- Okay.

23:23.507 --> 23:24.653
Hey, doc.

23:25.585 --> 23:27.390
You draw the short straw?

23:28.786 --> 23:30.773
You taking care of me now?

23:31.386 --> 23:33.763
Dr. Lockhart's with other patients.

23:34.498 --> 23:37.532
I'm only guessing,
but you're not from around here.

23:37.576 --> 23:39.343
No, Croatia.

23:40.035 --> 23:43.663
- Long way from home.
- Well, this is my home now.

23:43.907 --> 23:45.921
You have some mild wheezing.

23:47.128 --> 23:49.342
First-time visitor myself.

23:49.756 --> 23:52.023
I probably should've come in the spring.

23:52.077 --> 23:54.891
A friend of mine told me
winters could be tough.

23:54.907 --> 23:56.750
It's not too bad.

23:58.895 --> 24:01.421
You, uh... planning
on raising your son here?

24:04.697 --> 24:07.091
Abby told me.
Congratulations.

24:07.105 --> 24:08.833
You mean Dr. Lockhart?

24:10.295 --> 24:12.822
- Luka, you need these?
- Yeah, thanks, Sam.

24:12.898 --> 24:16.160
I'm not discussing
my personal life with patients.

24:18.306 --> 24:21.621
Okay, Sam, five of Albuterol
and check on him in 30 minutes.

24:21.638 --> 24:25.441
- Have me paged if somebody needs me.
- Listen, doc, if I spoke out of line...

24:29.245 --> 24:30.632
Wait. No, no, sir.
Don't touch it.

24:30.645 --> 24:32.300
- Don't touch it.
- Okay.

24:32.308 --> 24:34.670
It's official.
Every department has passed the buck.

24:34.678 --> 24:36.402
Surgery, Neurosurg, and ENT?

24:36.418 --> 24:38.672
Uh-huh, they all claim
it's not their problem.

24:38.705 --> 24:40.490
What are we going to do?

24:42.765 --> 24:45.822
I say we pull it out.
Come on.

24:45.835 --> 24:48.991
Come on, let's show those wusses
that the ER is not afraid of a...

24:49.006 --> 24:51.291
10-inch ice pick in a man's skull?

24:52.405 --> 24:53.560
No, no.

24:53.916 --> 24:55.982
- Push three of Versed.
- I don't know. It's kinda...

24:56.005 --> 24:58.860
The films show it missed
everything on the way in.

24:58.877 --> 25:02.303
So all we have to do is ease it
out along the same path,

25:02.315 --> 25:03.883
and admit him for IV antibiotics.

25:03.897 --> 25:06.092
- I know, but what if...
- Not to mention,

25:06.107 --> 25:08.212
this is a publishable case report...

25:08.368 --> 25:11.733
for any ambitious med student,
intern or resident.

25:12.926 --> 25:14.482
- Well, it's not the craziest...
- No!

25:14.486 --> 25:16.922
- The guy can't walk around...
- If we don't it, he's gonna do it himself.

25:16.936 --> 25:18.373
Okay.

25:21.348 --> 25:22.731
Who wants to do it?

25:23.747 --> 25:25.282
- I'll do it!
- Attagirl.

25:25.298 --> 25:28.001
All right.
Don't wiggle the handle, Hope.

25:28.166 --> 25:30.281
- Just give it one good tug, okay?
- Don't be nervous.

25:30.466 --> 25:34.731
- Now, relax, and pull, gentle, but firm.
- Okay.

25:48.078 --> 25:50.880
- Is there any pain when I press here?
- No.

25:50.926 --> 25:53.190
- How about here?
- Uh-uh.

25:54.105 --> 25:54.941
Okay.

25:54.966 --> 25:58.160
I'm gonna need to take a look inside you.

25:58.245 --> 25:59.292
They already did that.

25:59.307 --> 26:01.041
I know, but I'm checking
for other things.

26:01.057 --> 26:03.553
- It's okay, honey.
- Angela.

26:03.678 --> 26:06.221
The detective is asking if
you could step out for a moment.

26:06.238 --> 26:08.060
I need to stay with my daughter.

26:08.447 --> 26:11.232
It's okay, Mom.
You can go.

26:11.577 --> 26:13.221
I want you to.

26:14.956 --> 26:18.791
Okay. If that's what you want.

26:24.727 --> 26:27.170
I'm going to see how deep the cuts are.

26:28.075 --> 26:29.581
They're not bad.

26:33.306 --> 26:34.653
I know.

26:36.847 --> 26:38.742
How do you know the cuts weren't deep?

26:42.027 --> 26:46.990
Honey... did you do this to yourself?

26:51.985 --> 26:53.943
Please don't tell my mom.

27:11.286 --> 27:13.382
- How many loads you hauled out today?
- Four.

27:13.406 --> 27:16.192
The boss wants to make sure you get
that load you left in the corner last time.

27:16.205 --> 27:17.982
Hey, go screw yourself.

27:19.327 --> 27:20.701
Mr. Ames?

27:23.186 --> 27:25.480
- Man, what are you doing here?
- We need to talk.

27:25.486 --> 27:27.730
Man, I'm working now.
This is not a good time, all right?

27:27.745 --> 27:29.973
- I don't care.
- Ames!

27:30.355 --> 27:32.513
I don't pay you to chitchat.

27:33.285 --> 27:36.103
Is it okay if I, uh,
if I take my break right now?

27:36.118 --> 27:37.501
Ten minutes.

27:42.206 --> 27:43.292
You're lying.

27:43.307 --> 27:45.402
Check my time cards if you
don't believe me. It wasn't me.

27:45.508 --> 27:47.012
I don't even know where you live, man.

27:47.025 --> 27:50.122
And it wasn't you in the park.
And you didn't send me my son's toy.

27:50.138 --> 27:53.680
- Your initials were on it.
- Why are you doing this to me?

27:53.707 --> 27:57.111
You sent the police to my job.
I can't have you doing that.

27:57.128 --> 28:00.070
- This job is all I got left now.
- Stop playing games.

28:00.598 --> 28:03.890
I'm just trying to live my life
and make it through one more day.

28:04.147 --> 28:06.653
My family is gone.
My house is gone.

28:06.665 --> 28:08.380
I'm living in my car.

28:08.396 --> 28:10.931
- My damn car.
- That's not my problem, okay?

28:10.946 --> 28:12.692
What is it you want from me?

28:12.705 --> 28:16.570
You've been watching my family,
following us. That stops right now.

28:16.915 --> 28:19.892
I would never do anything
to hurt your family.

28:20.125 --> 28:22.092
I know what it's like to lose one.

28:24.297 --> 28:25.781
You do, too, right?

28:26.456 --> 28:28.912
I heard that you were
married once with kids.

28:29.806 --> 28:31.772
Must be horrible going through all that.

28:32.845 --> 28:34.530
I gotta get back to work, all right?

28:35.716 --> 28:37.121
Listen to me, Ames.

28:37.398 --> 28:40.850
Come near my family again,
I'll kill you.

28:54.286 --> 28:57.621
- I'm so sorry, it's all my fault.
- No, no. It was my idea.

28:57.636 --> 28:59.543
Maybe I pulled the handle
too hard or I...

28:59.556 --> 29:03.911
Hope, no, no. You were the only one in
the entire hospital to step up to the plate.

29:03.925 --> 29:05.442
I'm proud of you.

29:06.716 --> 29:09.911
- So how is he?
- The human shish-kebab will be fine,

29:09.916 --> 29:12.161
no thanks to that incredibly
imbecilic stunt of yours.

29:12.178 --> 29:14.533
Hey, how were we supposed to know
the handle would break off?

29:14.545 --> 29:16.741
Okay, all right, just for fun,
let's pretend

29:16.757 --> 29:19.842
that you each had even
a modicum of grey matter

29:19.856 --> 29:23.042
that you somehow managed
to fashion into some crude,

29:23.046 --> 29:25.041
rudimentary semblance of a brain.

29:25.056 --> 29:27.452
Maybe then you would know
that you never pull out

29:27.456 --> 29:29.711
something near a vital structure
unless you're in the OR.

29:29.725 --> 29:32.842
We remove foreign bodies
all the time in the ER.

29:32.856 --> 29:35.581
Pulling a vibrator out of
someone's ass... not the same thing.

29:35.598 --> 29:38.903
Hey, hey, Dr. Bobek acted under
my supervision and my orders.

29:38.916 --> 29:40.953
Perfect.
You got the halfwit leading the dimwit.

29:40.966 --> 29:43.533
Look, you obnoxious boor.

29:44.025 --> 29:47.003
The ER works damn hard
for every patient we see.

29:47.028 --> 29:49.692
We acted in this guy's
best interest when no one,

29:49.708 --> 29:51.841
not even surgery,
would give him the time of day.

29:51.858 --> 29:54.302
Now, did we do something
that didn't work? Yes, fine.

29:54.317 --> 29:57.021
It happens sometimes;
I will take full responsibility.

29:57.038 --> 29:59.133
But at least we got off
our asses and tried to help.

29:59.148 --> 30:02.972
Oh, well, gold stars for the ER asses.

30:03.395 --> 30:04.442
Hey...

30:06.855 --> 30:09.391
What is it about your need
to belittle other people?

30:09.875 --> 30:12.743
Does insulting someone
make you feel like a man?

30:13.137 --> 30:16.721
Bolster what little self-esteem
you're clinging to?

30:17.755 --> 30:19.281
Wow, you know...

30:19.678 --> 30:23.152
I can't even begin to imagine
what happened in your life

30:23.166 --> 30:25.750
to make you the kind of person
that everybody hates.

30:34.887 --> 30:36.990
I could kiss you right now.

30:37.876 --> 30:39.051
Really?

30:39.967 --> 30:42.952
Hmm... now it's gone.

30:45.805 --> 30:47.173
Sorry this took so long.

30:47.185 --> 30:49.190
It's just kind of the way
things work around here.

30:49.208 --> 30:50.330
Oh, I didn't mind.

30:50.347 --> 30:52.160
Uh, don't forget to fill
your prescription

30:52.175 --> 30:54.701
and remember you need to take
the Prednisone with food.

30:54.717 --> 30:56.850
Yes, ma'am. If you say so.

30:56.875 --> 30:59.351
And you need to follow up
with your doctor in a week.

30:59.368 --> 31:02.882
Right.
Um... what are your office hours?

31:02.908 --> 31:06.160
Um, I can refer you
to the pulmonary clinic.

31:06.475 --> 31:09.322
- Ah, that's all right. I'll work it out.
- Okay.

31:13.218 --> 31:15.751
Hey, hey.
Where'd you disappear to?

31:15.768 --> 31:17.661
Dr. Kovac, I need to talk to you.

31:17.675 --> 31:20.750
Y-Yeah. Nowhere.
I'll see you later.

31:21.886 --> 31:24.461
He seems like an interesting guy.

31:26.438 --> 31:28.423
Could use a little work
on his bedside manner.

31:28.435 --> 31:29.961
Well, it's been a rough day.

31:29.975 --> 31:34.350
- Hey, Abby. Weaver's coming on.
- Okay. Uh... good-bye, Eddie.

31:34.367 --> 31:37.100
- Take care.
- Good night.

31:39.208 --> 31:41.430
- Did I miss anything?
- No, I think it's on after the weather.

31:41.445 --> 31:43.733
Timmy, Channel 5 now.

31:45.715 --> 31:47.800
Pretty easy once you get
the hang of it, huh?

31:47.938 --> 31:50.890
Yeah. Look, I appreciate you
showing me the ropes today.

31:50.906 --> 31:56.453
Oh, please, I was once a, uh...
brash, overconfident new nurse myself.

31:56.468 --> 31:59.110
I just hope that we haven't changed
your mind about County.

31:59.125 --> 32:00.372
No, not yet.

32:00.507 --> 32:04.890
Why don't you let me buy you a drink or take
you out to dinner just to say thank you.

32:05.186 --> 32:08.130
- You mean like a date?
- Does it sound like a date?

32:08.146 --> 32:09.433
Kinda.

32:09.735 --> 32:11.820
You can call it whatever you want.
Just say yes.

32:13.198 --> 32:15.800
So, uh, did my incarcerated hernia guy...?

32:15.815 --> 32:19.102
- Still in line for the OR.
- What? Do you think he needs a colostomy?

32:19.128 --> 32:21.840
Well, uh, it'll have to wait
until I get there.

32:21.855 --> 32:24.990
Hey, Ray, you forgot to fill out
the consult request on your CF'er.

32:25.008 --> 32:28.232
- This is Dr. Rasgotra. I was paged.
- Thanks. I'm sorry about that.

32:28.245 --> 32:31.651
Hey, and, uh...
you guys got to knock it off.

32:32.146 --> 32:34.892
I'm talking about Katey.
She's a med student, Ray.

32:34.918 --> 32:37.181
- I'm not gonna be evaluating her.
- Doesn't matter.

32:37.196 --> 32:39.152
I don't want you distracted
or your judgment impaired.

32:39.165 --> 32:40.533
My judgment is fine.

32:40.545 --> 32:43.133
Besides, it's not like it's not going
on around here all the time.

32:43.147 --> 32:45.530
Yeah, well, as long as I'm running
the floor, it isn't, okay?

32:45.548 --> 32:46.771
Tell you what, Pratt.

32:46.785 --> 32:50.153
When it's your business to know
about my love life, I'll let you know.

32:50.177 --> 32:54.023
- Hey, hey, she's on.
- Shh, somebody turn up the sound.

32:54.615 --> 32:58.361
Last week, while looking for cans
and bottles in the dumpster behind me,

32:58.377 --> 33:00.210
- two homeless men found...
- Weaver's a real natural.

33:00.218 --> 33:03.002
...what they thought was
a child's discarded doll.

33:03.018 --> 33:06.272
Wow, this really turned out good.

33:06.386 --> 33:09.960
- It's only TV.
- You're kidding, right?

33:09.966 --> 33:12.510
Shh, Henry just fell asleep.

33:12.525 --> 33:17.371
How many patients do you treat
in one ER shift? 25, 30 tops?

33:17.388 --> 33:20.143
- I don't know. It depends.
- Okay, well, on TV,

33:20.158 --> 33:23.992
you can reach a hell of a lot more
than 30 people, and still help them.

33:24.005 --> 33:28.770
- No, it's not the same.
- Yeah, but it still counts.

33:29.476 --> 33:33.541
Oh, my gosh.
I can't believe it's me up there.

33:33.555 --> 33:38.390
Yeah, well, you better get used to it,
because you're really very good.

33:39.396 --> 33:41.963
I couldn't have done it
without my producer.

33:56.128 --> 33:57.161
Hey.

33:57.596 --> 33:59.643
Hey, you heading out?

34:00.135 --> 34:01.442
Thank God.

34:01.457 --> 34:03.611
- It's been a long day.
- Yeah, this place can suck at times.

34:03.627 --> 34:05.512
Better leave while you can, huh?

34:06.556 --> 34:11.650
Uh, you know, Pratt's right.
It's not cool to date a student.

34:12.775 --> 34:15.511
- So now this is your business, too?
- No, I'm only saying.

34:15.527 --> 34:18.150
She's nice and everything.
I mean, I like her, but...

34:18.166 --> 34:20.172
But what, Neela, what?

34:20.797 --> 34:22.812
Nothing. I'm concerned.

34:24.118 --> 34:26.953
Well, thank you, but I'm good...

34:26.976 --> 34:29.469
and Katey's good.
In fact, things are going great.

34:29.475 --> 34:32.771
- Well, then, I'm happy for you.
- So, what's this really about?

34:32.804 --> 34:35.641
- What?
- Why do you care all of a sudden?

34:35.656 --> 34:38.770
We're friends, right? That's what friends do.
Talk about the people in each other's lives.

34:38.784 --> 34:43.841
Oh, oh, that's how it is.
Well, okay, friend, um, how's Gates?

34:45.407 --> 34:48.643
'Cause you know what? I'm really not
into playing your games anymore.

34:48.658 --> 34:51.272
- What are you talking about?
- Do you really think I'm gonna hang out

34:51.288 --> 34:54.183
waiting for you to find out that
he's just jerking you around?

34:54.456 --> 34:56.940
Neela, you made your choice.

34:57.585 --> 34:59.641
You can't have it both ways.

35:00.138 --> 35:03.871
Ms. Gilliam, if you can think
of anything else, give us a call.

35:03.888 --> 35:05.871
Sure. Thank you.

35:11.755 --> 35:14.591
- Is your husband back?
- He'll be back soon.

35:14.947 --> 35:19.581
The police wanted to look at Danielle's
computer, see if she kept a diary.

35:20.338 --> 35:23.253
Angela, I need to tell you something.

35:23.568 --> 35:30.541
Uh... when Danielle was being
examined by surgeons,

35:30.645 --> 35:36.211
she told the doctor and the nurse
in the room that she did this.

35:37.618 --> 35:39.410
She cut herself.

35:40.666 --> 35:42.322
That's not possible.

35:42.337 --> 35:46.071
- They must have misunderstood her.
- Well, she said she's done it before,

35:46.078 --> 35:48.461
but today she couldn't
control the bleeding.

35:48.475 --> 35:52.862
She got frightened and she tried to run
home, and that's when they found her.

35:53.006 --> 35:58.122
She also said a boy kissed her
before class today.

35:58.166 --> 36:01.243
He tried to reach under her skirt,
she pushed him away,

36:01.255 --> 36:04.822
- but she said she remembered something.
- Remembered what?

36:05.125 --> 36:07.670
That's when she went to
the girl's room and cut herself.

36:07.845 --> 36:11.400
- Luka, I don't understand.
- Angela...

36:12.737 --> 36:17.990
Danielle talked about something
that happened to you in Detroit,

36:19.477 --> 36:21.760
something she witnessed.

36:25.196 --> 36:27.152
Oh, God...

36:30.086 --> 36:31.981
She saw...

36:40.105 --> 36:42.731
When Danielle was nine,

36:42.746 --> 36:50.390
a man came to the door of our apartment,
said he was doing repairs in the complex.

36:50.857 --> 36:56.873
He wore overalls and carried
a tool box, so I let him in and...

36:59.557 --> 37:01.723
he raped me.

37:10.275 --> 37:13.381
Danielle was playing outside.

37:17.226 --> 37:19.881
I never thought she had any idea.

37:27.458 --> 37:29.872
I never told anyone.

37:31.387 --> 37:33.112
Not even Paul.

37:36.057 --> 37:41.221
I didn't want to upset Danielle.
I just wanted to put it all behind me.

37:41.987 --> 37:45.041
- What did I do?
- This isn't your fault.

37:45.056 --> 37:46.812
What did I do?

37:48.647 --> 37:51.163
I was so busy trying
to keep it all together

37:51.177 --> 37:54.233
I didn't even see what my own
daughter was going through.

37:54.245 --> 37:57.271
You did what you thought was best.

37:59.547 --> 38:02.071
You were just trying
to protect your family.

38:11.736 --> 38:13.122
Hey, Neela.

38:13.556 --> 38:16.140
- Neela, wait up.
- Oh, not now. Really, not now.

38:16.156 --> 38:17.762
Didn't get the chance to tell you earlier: I'm moving.

38:17.777 --> 38:19.141
Oh, yeah, where?

38:19.157 --> 38:21.512
Well, I haven't actually
found a place yet, but...

38:21.528 --> 38:23.002
I so don't have time for this crap.

38:23.018 --> 38:26.190
Look, it's not like I can just walk out of there tomorrow.

38:26.208 --> 38:27.622
- No?
- No.

38:27.638 --> 38:29.682
Sarah and Meg have had
it rough for a long time

38:29.698 --> 38:32.640
- and they've come to count on me.
- Yeah, it must feel good to be the big hero.

38:32.657 --> 38:34.862
I promised my buddy a long time ago

38:34.865 --> 38:37.243
- that I would take care of them...
- Oh, yeah, right, the promise.

38:37.255 --> 38:39.813
Tell me, was sleeping with your best
friend's wife part of the deal, too?

38:39.827 --> 38:42.493
It wasn't about that.
You know, you're not making this easy.

38:42.507 --> 38:45.111
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize
I was supposed to.

38:45.128 --> 38:49.243
Look, right or wrong, yes,
Meg and I sometimes...

38:49.588 --> 38:52.283
Maybe it was out of comfort
or convenience or loneliness.

38:52.298 --> 38:54.731
I don't know what you want to call it,
but it wasn't love and we both knew that.

38:54.748 --> 38:58.882
Enough. Just stop.
Stop lying.

38:59.477 --> 39:00.571
You're right.

39:00.806 --> 39:03.483
You're right.
I haven't been honest for a long time.

39:03.815 --> 39:09.073
For ten years, I've dealt with people
and things in my life in a way that I

39:09.107 --> 39:10.423
wouldn't have to get too close.

39:10.438 --> 39:12.352
Oh, and I suppose now you're going
to tell me that it's different.

39:12.366 --> 39:14.753
Hell, yes.
Since I met you, I've been a mess.

39:14.798 --> 39:20.003
You're making me think about the way
I want my life to be, the way it could be.

39:20.627 --> 39:21.951
I am?

39:25.276 --> 39:26.793
My train's here.

39:50.156 --> 39:52.692
Hey, Chaz, Chaz.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, man,

39:52.776 --> 39:54.060
what are you doing?

39:54.516 --> 39:56.630
- Wait in the car for me, okay?
- Sure.

39:57.976 --> 40:00.283
- You don't have to leave.
- Yeah, I do.

40:00.985 --> 40:04.321
- I never said I wasn't cool with it.
- You never said you were.

40:06.497 --> 40:09.490
All right, look, I-I work
on gay patients all the time.

40:09.576 --> 40:14.382
I work with gay doctors, but
when it comes to my own blood, I...

40:14.788 --> 40:16.922
I just need some time.
That's all.

40:17.606 --> 40:20.611
Some time.
That's funny.

40:21.576 --> 40:23.430
Greg, you're a lot more like Dad
than you realize.

40:23.436 --> 40:24.450
No.

40:26.235 --> 40:28.511
It's not coming out like I mean.

40:28.537 --> 40:31.061
I could see when I told you
you weren't okay with it.

40:31.975 --> 40:34.192
And maybe you'll never be okay with it.

40:35.805 --> 40:38.222
I sure hope someday you prove me wrong.

40:48.577 --> 40:51.790
So, tomorrow, they're taking
Danielle to a private facility.

40:52.065 --> 40:54.861
Well, it sounds like she's getting
the help she needs.

40:55.158 --> 40:59.471
Yeah, yeah, it's going to take some time,
but I think they'll all get through it.

41:01.016 --> 41:03.833
Abby, you asked me about where I went.

41:05.275 --> 41:07.202
Yes, and you said something
about "nowhere."

41:07.215 --> 41:11.010
- I went to see Curtis Ames.
- The patient who sued you?

41:11.027 --> 41:16.432
That guy in the park, when you lost
Joe's toy, that was, that was Ames.

41:16.878 --> 41:17.930
How do you know?

41:17.955 --> 41:21.553
And this morning, he was on our street.
He has been following us.

41:22.476 --> 41:23.560
What?

41:24.166 --> 41:27.780
- I don't have proof, but today...
- Wait, you didn't say anything?

41:27.807 --> 41:29.760
- No, I just... I-I thought...
- Luka.

41:29.765 --> 41:32.480
I-I've been walking all
around Chicago with our son.

41:32.486 --> 41:35.200
- I know.
- and the babysitter takes him out every day.

41:35.265 --> 41:37.761
And there's a crazy,
angry guy following us?

41:37.777 --> 41:40.431
- Well, it's over now.
- How do you know that? You don't know that.

41:40.447 --> 41:42.223
- I know because I took care of it.
- How did you take care of it?

41:42.225 --> 41:44.452
I took care of it.
Hey, let's just go home.

41:44.466 --> 41:46.461
We can talk about it there.
Abby.

41:46.476 --> 41:47.572
Taxi!

41:47.586 --> 41:49.242
- Abby, what are you doing?
- The train is too slow;

41:49.255 --> 41:52.192
- I just want to get home.
- Okay.

41:53.635 --> 41:56.652
I can't believe this.
I cannot believe you didn't tell me.

41:56.666 --> 42:00.001
- I didn't want you to worry.
- You didn't want me to worry?

42:00.016 --> 42:02.060
- I thought we were past this.
- Past what?

42:02.075 --> 42:03.673
- What are you talking about now?
- This-- in our relationship--

42:03.688 --> 42:07.871
This need you have to protect me or,
or shield me from the hurts of the world.

42:07.886 --> 42:10.252
Why are you bringing all that up?
It's different now.

42:10.256 --> 42:12.622
- We're different people.
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

42:13.226 --> 42:17.792
Look, I know I should have told you,
but this is just about Ames.

42:17.805 --> 42:20.372
- Don't make it about us.
- It is about us.

42:20.826 --> 42:22.921
I'm going.
Are you coming or what?

42:41.506 --> 42:45.673
