00:30.574 --> 00:31.693
Hey

00:31.728 --> 00:34.310
Well, well, well I always
suspected this day would come.

00:34.329 --> 00:34.835
Hi Kirk.

00:34.836 --> 00:36.052
You're not getting this seat back.

00:36.053 --> 00:36.560
Huh?

00:36.561 --> 00:38.231
You can't, it's mine now and frankly

00:38.232 --> 00:39.954
I can see why you hogged it for so long.

00:39.955 --> 00:40.538
What?

00:40.539 --> 00:42.209
It's clearly the best stool in the joint.

00:42.210 --> 00:44.600
Close to the cash register and the kitchen,

00:44.601 --> 00:46.458
which guarantees plenty
of face time with the boss.

00:46.659 --> 00:49.340
Climate wise it's positioned
between two air-conditioning vents

00:49.341 --> 00:51.290
which creates a nice cross ventilation…

00:51.291 --> 00:52.056
- Hey Kirk…
- …never.

00:52.057 --> 00:53.986
You can have the seat. Hey

00:53.987 --> 00:55.278
Hey.

00:57.495 --> 00:58.894
- Coffee?
- Yes please.

00:58.929 --> 01:00.749
All right, ah to stay or to go?

01:00.750 --> 01:04.775
-  Um… To stay.
- Good, okay.

01:06.476 --> 01:08.140
- Lorelai.
- Hi ya doll.

01:08.145 --> 01:08.745
Hey.

01:08.733 --> 01:10.865
It's so nice seeing you back in here.

01:10.866 --> 01:12.970
- Thanks.
- Been a long time.

01:12.971 --> 01:13.980
What 9, 10 months.

01:13.981 --> 01:14.763
Something like that.

01:14.764 --> 01:15.950
Actually I can tell you exactly when

01:15.951 --> 01:18.439
Lorelai was in her last
'cause I marked it in my calendar.

01:18.440 --> 01:22.652
"May 22, 2006, stool
available?" it's important to…

01:22.653 --> 01:24.126
Enough Kirk, here you go.

01:24.127 --> 01:29.052
-Thank you.
- So how's it going?

01:29.053 --> 01:31.297
Oh really well. They inn is really busy.

01:31.298 --> 01:32.298
Yeah I'll bet.

01:32.299 --> 01:34.590
And so how are you doing.

01:34.591 --> 01:37.024
Me? Good, really good.

01:37.930 --> 01:41.314
- Good.
- Yeah.

01:42.882 --> 01:44.685
Um, it sure is warm outside.

01:44.686 --> 01:46.733
Yeah you know when
I opened the diner this morning

01:46.734 --> 01:50.280
I remember thinking how warm it was.

01:50.281 --> 01:51.849
- Really!
- Yeah.

01:54.319 --> 01:56.078
You know what maybe I should take this to go.

01:56.079 --> 01:57.079
To get back to work and.

01:57.080 --> 01:58.871
Yeah okay let me just get you a cup.

01:58.872 --> 02:00.261
It's been really busy at the Inn.

02:00.262 --> 02:02.248
Yeah. Yeah you said. There you go.

02:02.249 --> 02:03.045
Lid on there.

02:03.046 --> 02:04.447
Oh great.

02:06.200 --> 02:08.324
-Nah, I got it.
-Thanks.

02:08.324 --> 02:10.332
Okay so I'll see you around.

02:10.333 --> 02:11.955
Definitely, I'll see you around. Okay.

02:14.067 --> 02:15.724
-Bye.
- Bye.

02:24.495 --> 02:26.447
Subtitle by Maglori

03:21.797 --> 03:24.372
- Hi.
- Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!

03:24.373 --> 03:25.560
You called me.

03:25.561 --> 03:27.930
Oh, no, not you.
I was talking to Davey. Hey.

03:27.931 --> 03:28.596
Hey.

03:28.597 --> 03:30.870
I was just calling to let
you know I'm not coming into work today.

03:30.871 --> 03:33.753
No, no, no, no, no itching.
No itching. Just pat, pat. Par, pat.

03:34.390 --> 03:35.158
Is everything okay?

03:35.159 --> 03:38.421
Oh, everything's fine.
I just hate that stupid Rosie Milano

03:38.422 --> 03:40.861
Ugh, is she the woman
at Davey's school with the big,

03:40.862 --> 03:42.419
fake boobs who all the dads think are real?

03:42.420 --> 03:43.481
No, but I hate her, too.

03:43.482 --> 03:46.114
Rosie Milano is a little girl in Davey's class.

03:46.115 --> 03:48.135
Oh. Interesting choice for your nemesis.

03:48.136 --> 03:49.732
She came to school with the chicken pox.

03:49.733 --> 03:53.299
Oh, no, I hate her, too. Davey and Martha?

03:53.300 --> 03:54.927
Yeah. I mean, not terrible cases.

03:54.928 --> 03:56.652
They've both been vaccinated,

03:56.653 --> 03:58.003
but I'm up to my ears in oatmeal baths.

03:58.009 --> 03:59.964
Plus I've got to find a hotel for Jackson

03:59.965 --> 04:02.866
because the inn is
completely full -- "go, us," by the way.

04:02.867 --> 04:04.612
Why does Jackson need to stay in a hotel?

04:04.613 --> 04:05.991
He's never had the chicken pox.

04:06.392 --> 04:09.289
I mean I know he's already
been exposed, so he may get them anyway,

04:09.290 --> 04:11.850
but if there's a chance in
hell to avoid him getting them,

04:11.851 --> 04:13.935
I'm gonna do it because
that man is a huge baby.

04:13.936 --> 04:16.209
Well he doesn't need to stay
at a hotel, he can just stay at my place.

04:16.211 --> 04:19.382
Lorelai, you are my
best friend in the entire world.

04:19.382 --> 04:21.130
I could not sic Jackson on you.

04:21.130 --> 04:22.031
Oh, please.

04:22.031 --> 04:24.770
No, the man's a slob. This morning,

04:24.771 --> 04:26.970
I could have killed him,
with the wet towels all over the floor.

04:26.971 --> 04:29.775
It's so not a big deal.
Why waste money on a hotel?

04:29.776 --> 04:30.661
Are you sure?

04:30.662 --> 04:33.810
Yes. Please, end of discussion. He's staying with me.

04:33.811 --> 04:35.628
Okay, well, thank you, and

04:35.629 --> 04:37.678
I want you to remember
this moment because you offered.

04:37.679 --> 04:39.001
Okay, well...

04:39.002 --> 04:40.339
Okay. Well, I'm gonna pick him up

04:40.340 --> 04:42.613
and bring him over to you around 6:00.

04:42.614 --> 04:45.617
Yeah, that sounds good.
Hey, so I went into Luke's this morning.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.342
What? Why didn't you cut me off?

04:47.343 --> 04:49.911
It's not like the kids
have bubonic plague. How did it go?

04:49.912 --> 04:51.602
- It was awful.
- Oh!

04:51.603 --> 04:53.781
Yeah everybody was staring at us.

04:53.782 --> 04:55.195
Oh, I'm sure they weren't.

04:55.196 --> 04:55.789
Sookie.

04:55.790 --> 04:57.056
Yeah, they were staring.

04:57.057 --> 04:59.985
Yeah it was just awkward,
and neither of us knew how to act

04:59.986 --> 05:01.751
I'm sure it seemed worse than it really was.

05:01.752 --> 05:03.961
Uh, no. We hit the weather in the first minute

05:03.962 --> 05:06.289
Well, it has been unseasonably warm,

05:06.290 --> 05:08.414
but you know things will get better.

05:08.415 --> 05:10.374
I don't know. Maybe
there's just too much history.

05:10.375 --> 05:11.562
Oh, history, schmistory.

05:11.563 --> 05:14.163
Couples have been
breaking up and becoming friends.

05:14.164 --> 05:16.178
I mean look at Ryan
O'neal and Farrah Fawcett, huh?

05:16.179 --> 05:17.564
Really Ryan and Fawcett that's the most

05:17.565 --> 05:19.372
well-adjusted relationship you can come up with?

05:19.373 --> 05:21.136
I mean I'm sorry. He's been in the news lately

05:21.137 --> 05:23.150
-- that whole shooting-a-gun-at-his-son thing.

05:23.151 --> 05:24.622
Hey, s-- oh! God.

05:24.623 --> 05:25.509
What was that?

05:25.510 --> 05:27.504
- I don't know.
- Oh!

05:27.505 --> 05:29.612
Oh! It's coming from my car.

05:29.613 --> 05:31.239
- Pull over.
- I am.

05:31.240 --> 05:32.921
Pull over! Pull over! Pull over!

05:32.922 --> 05:35.432
I am. I am. I-I've pulled
over. Hold on. I'm turning it off.

05:35.433 --> 05:36.699
Are you okay?

05:36.700 --> 05:37.923
Yeah, I think so.

05:37.924 --> 05:39.276
Well, what was that?

05:39.277 --> 05:41.723
You know, the carburetor?

05:41.724 --> 05:44.237
Oh. Ooh, or maybe the alternator.

05:44.238 --> 05:45.932
I think I better call Gypsy

05:45.933 --> 05:47.240
That's probably a good idea.

05:47.241 --> 05:48.338
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

05:54.322 --> 05:58.004
Finally. Doyle, she's here! Where were you?

05:58.005 --> 06:00.370
Your "20th century poets"
class ended two hours ago.

06:00.371 --> 06:01.134
Hey, Rory.

06:01.135 --> 06:03.748
Hey, Doyle. I was
just dropping Logan off at the airport.

06:03.749 --> 06:05.824
Oh yeah he has
that meeting in San Fran. When is it?

06:05.825 --> 06:06.416
Tomorrow afternoon.

06:07.537 --> 06:07.942
- Wish him luck for me.
- I will.

06:07.943 --> 06:09.390
Seriously, you're gonna stand here making idle chitchat

06:09.391 --> 06:11.501
on the single most important day of my life?

06:11.502 --> 06:13.845
Sorry, sweetie. Paris has some news

06:13.846 --> 06:14.796
Not some news, the news.

06:14.797 --> 06:17.816
Responses from Harvard medical school,

06:17.817 --> 06:20.963
Johns Hopkins school of
medicine, Penn medical, Yale law school,

06:20.964 --> 06:22.819
Stanford law school, and Columbia medical.

06:22.820 --> 06:24.800
And before you comment on envelope thickness,

06:24.801 --> 06:26.665
keep in mind that so much stuff is online

06:26.666 --> 06:29.121
these days that thickness
is no longer an accurate indicator.

06:29.122 --> 06:29.695
Mm-hmm

06:29.696 --> 06:31.177
I knew you would want
to be here, when I opened them.

06:31.178 --> 06:32.760
Yeah, right. Thanks.

06:33.785 --> 06:34.655
Go on, hon. Do it!

06:34.656 --> 06:38.019
Okay. My lucky letter opener.

06:38.020 --> 06:39.764
Used it to open the envelope conveying

06:39.765 --> 06:41.299
my acceptance to Yale four years ago.

06:41.300 --> 06:43.678
And don't look at me
like I'm some kind of superstitious freak.

06:43.679 --> 06:46.256
It's just a precautionary device. If it works, great.

06:46.257 --> 06:48.144
If not, I need it to open letters anyway.

06:50.145 --> 06:54.370
I don't know which to open first. Choose one.

06:55.271 --> 06:58.789
Okay... Yale law school.

06:58.790 --> 07:02.329
Yale law school. Okay,
wow. That's a great school.

07:02.330 --> 07:05.364
I'd be lucky to get in
there, you know? You open it.

07:05.365 --> 07:07.559
- Me?
- You're lucky.
- I am?

07:07.560 --> 07:08.869
How else do you explain the fact that

07:08.870 --> 07:10.541
you got into Harvard and I didn't?

07:10.542 --> 07:12.647
Oh, right, luck. Okay.

07:12.848 --> 07:13.745
Use the letter opener!

07:13.746 --> 07:15.829
Oh. Are you sure the letter opener's luck

07:15.830 --> 07:17.297
isn't gonna cancel out my luck?

07:17.298 --> 07:18.485
I don't know, is that how it works?

07:18.486 --> 07:23.794
I was kidding. Sorry. Here we go. All right.

07:26.412 --> 07:30.246
"Dear Paris Geller, we are pleased to inform you --"

07:30.247 --> 07:31.274
I got in! Whoo!

07:38.507 --> 07:40.552
Congratulations! I'm so happy for you.

07:40.553 --> 07:43.252
Thank you. Thank you
so much for your participation

07:43.253 --> 07:46.280
in operation finish line,
for your friendship, for everything.

07:46.281 --> 07:48.633
You've always been an
inspiration to me, Rory Gilmore.

07:48.634 --> 07:49.491
Aw.

07:49.492 --> 07:51.072
I mean, the way you cut your ruthless path to

07:51.073 --> 07:52.954
the head of the Yale daily
news and never looked back --

07:52.955 --> 07:54.890
I never told you, but I really admired that.

07:55.591 --> 07:56.038
Thanks?

07:57.021 --> 07:58.906
And, Doyle, I know this process

07:58.907 --> 08:01.060
didn't exactly bring out my soft and fuzzy side.

08:01.061 --> 08:04.995
Doesn't matter. I love you,
baby, and I am so proud of you.

08:04.996 --> 08:07.165
I love you, too. I just can't believe

08:07.166 --> 08:09.226
I got into the second
best law school in the country.

08:09.227 --> 08:12.524
It's such an honor! It
doesn't matter really if I get into the others.

08:12.525 --> 08:13.923
I have a great option right here.

08:13.924 --> 08:14.823
You do.

08:14.824 --> 08:19.210
Yeah! Anyway, go ahead.
Might as well open Harvard,

08:19.211 --> 08:21.621
even though it doesn't
matter. Use the letter opener again.

08:21.622 --> 08:31.790
Okay. Okay.
"We are pleased to inform…"

08:31.791 --> 08:34.344
Whoo! I got in! I got in!

08:37.000 --> 08:37.431
All right!

08:38.455 --> 08:39.506
Congratulations!

08:39.506 --> 08:41.105
Bite me, Harvard, bite me!

08:41.106 --> 08:41.890
Yeah, chock on it!

08:41.892 --> 08:43.799
I'm tempted to reject them the same way

08:43.799 --> 08:47.008
they rejected me that dark day
four years ago. Who's laughing now?!

08:47.009 --> 08:51.958
Okay, um, so, next we have,
what? The university of Pennsylvania?

08:51.959 --> 08:56.577
All right.
Let's see what it says.

08:59.866 --> 09:03.245
All right. "We are pleased to inform…"

09:03.246 --> 09:04.737
- In? I'm in? Yes!
- Oh!

09:09.788 --> 09:11.227
-What's that about?
- Hmm?

09:11.228 --> 09:13.051
Your noticeable drop-off in enthusiasm.

09:12.952 --> 09:15.424
Is that a reflection of
the fact that you're less impressed by

09:15.425 --> 09:17.395
my admission to the
university of Pennsylvania school of medicine

09:17.396 --> 09:18.644
than you were by my other acceptances?

09:18.645 --> 09:21.355
I'd say we're just as impressed. Wouldn't you, Doyle?

09:21.356 --> 09:24.341
Oh, absolutely.
Because it's a pre-eminent institution in

09:24.342 --> 09:26.903
the interrelated disciplines
of patient-care education and research.

09:26.904 --> 09:28.595
- It's a great school.
- Mm, top-notch.

09:28.596 --> 09:30.043
Fine, you've made your point.

09:30.044 --> 09:33.114
Perception should play
a role in my decision-making process.

09:33.115 --> 09:34.975
Well I guess that's what Doyle and I were saying.

09:34.976 --> 09:37.433
I mean lets face it, you say "Harvard medical school,"

09:37.434 --> 09:38.801
and people are automatically impressed

09:38.802 --> 09:39.867
and that counts for something.

09:39.868 --> 09:40.519
That's true.

09:40.520 --> 09:42.123
SO you think I should go there?

09:42.124 --> 09:45.297
Oh, well, that's not what
I'm saying -- or that you shouldn't.

09:45.298 --> 09:48.957
I'm just... What I'm saying is
that you have all these great options.

09:48.958 --> 09:49.459
Yeah.

09:49.460 --> 09:52.951
I know. So, how do I decide?

09:52.952 --> 09:54.370
Oh, you'll figure it out, hon.

09:54.371 --> 09:56.497
How? This is a huge decision.

09:56.498 --> 09:58.617
The biggest decision
I've had to make in my life.

09:58.652 --> 10:01.471
Law school or med school?
I have two passions,

10:01.472 --> 10:04.346
and obviously,
I'm vastly talented in both fields.

10:04.616 --> 10:06.523
What muse do I follow?

10:06.596 --> 10:08.099
Not to mention location-wise,

10:08.100 --> 10:10.649
where do I want to live for
the next three or up to eight years?

10:12.365 --> 10:13.275
Open the others.

10:13.276 --> 10:14.963
Yeah?

10:15.816 --> 10:17.937
Okay. Columbia.

10:19.711 --> 10:21.112
Also a good school.

10:23.134 --> 10:25.933
- "We are pleased…"
- Oh, god!

10:25.968 --> 10:28.844
Paris you're just being silly, okay?
It's good to have options.

10:28.845 --> 10:31.643
Yeah, right. You can say that
because there's only one thing you want.

10:31.644 --> 10:33.612
Talk to me if you don't
get the New York Times fellowship

10:33.647 --> 10:35.292
and you have to choose
between six other papers.

10:38.213 --> 10:43.047
I'm sorry. I just meant it
must be nice to know what you want.

10:43.048 --> 10:45.286
Well, "nice" -- yeah, that's one way to put it,

10:45.287 --> 10:46.571
and "scary" is another.

10:46.572 --> 10:47.809
You have a great shot at the Reston.

10:47.810 --> 10:49.876
You do and with A.J. Abrams writing that rec...

10:49.877 --> 10:52.758
Well I'm sure all the candidates
have great recommendations.

10:52.793 --> 10:54.243
New York Times would be
lucky to have you.

10:54.244 --> 10:58.294
Thanks. Well, I'll find out
soon enough, but come on.

10:58.329 --> 11:01.892
This is your moment.
Should we open another one?

11:05.893 --> 11:09.902
All right.
Hey, hey. You got into Stanford!

11:09.903 --> 11:11.911
- Whoa! Someone's on a roll!
- Yay!

11:11.912 --> 11:14.933
Enough with the hysterics.
I have a big decision to make,

11:14.934 --> 11:17.486
and all this hooting and
hollering isn't exactly helping matters.

11:23.205 --> 11:24.451
What do you mean you can't fix it, gypsy?

11:24.452 --> 11:25.597
It's only eight years old.

11:25.598 --> 11:28.961
Hi, come on in.
Everyone knows you can fix anything.

11:28.962 --> 11:33.686
Sit down. Sorry I have guest,
make yourselves at home okay.

11:33.687 --> 11:34.666
- Unh-unh-unh-unh.
- Wha…

11:34.667 --> 11:35.819
- Ignore Lorelai.
- What?

11:35.820 --> 11:38.137
You are absolutely not to make yourself at home,

11:38.138 --> 11:40.056
don't leave your clothes lying all over the house.

11:40.057 --> 11:40.614
I won't.

11:40.615 --> 11:42.709
Wipe your shoes off if
you go outside and come back in.

11:42.710 --> 11:44.465
I will. Don't leave
them laying around

11:44.466 --> 11:46.550
in the middle of the room or
anywhere where they can be smelled.

11:46.551 --> 11:47.041
Sookie.

11:47.042 --> 11:49.602
Just don't touch anything,
and hang up your wet towels.

11:49.603 --> 11:51.637
I have stayed at other people's houses before.

11:51.638 --> 11:53.533
I know. Why do you think I'm saying all of this?

11:53.534 --> 11:55.231
And just try not to annoy Lorelai.

11:55.232 --> 11:58.195
Believe it or not, I don't try to annoy other people.

11:58.196 --> 12:00.208
Well congratulations,
because you have a natural talent.

12:00.209 --> 12:01.141
- Sookie!
- What?

12:02.311 --> 12:03.605
Nothing. Is that all?

12:03.606 --> 12:05.004
No, I packed you a salad.

12:05.005 --> 12:07.715
Eat it in the kitchen at the table on a plate.

12:07.716 --> 12:09.080
Please do not make a mess.

12:09.654 --> 12:11.666
I wanted to stay around
and say thank you to Lorelai,

12:11.701 --> 12:12.810
but I should get back to the kids.

12:12.811 --> 12:14.040
Yeah, yeah you should get back to the kids.

12:14.041 --> 12:15.828
It sounded like that's gonna take a while.

12:15.863 --> 12:16.037
Really?

12:16.038 --> 12:17.806
Oh, yeah. They're talking about cars.

12:17.807 --> 12:20.235
I mean that phone call could
take hours. Go, really.

12:20.436 --> 12:22.340
- Call me if you need anything.
- I will.

12:22.343 --> 12:23.968
And don't use Lorelai's home phone.

12:23.969 --> 12:25.178
Kiss the kids good night for me.

12:25.179 --> 12:25.877
I will.

12:27.011 --> 12:31.948
Thanks for trying. Okay.
Thank you. Bye. 

12:33.270 --> 12:34.548
Sorry about that.

12:34.583 --> 12:37.563
No problem.
Thanks again for letting me stay.

12:37.564 --> 12:41.706
Oh, sure, my pleasure.
Have a seat. So, where's Sookie?

12:41.707 --> 12:43.261
Oh you know she had to get back to the kids.

12:44.194 --> 12:45.391
Oh. Well, how's she holding up?

12:45.392 --> 12:49.123
O-okay. A little tense.
What's going on with the car?

12:49.124 --> 12:51.222
Gypsy says I have to put it down.

12:51.223 --> 12:51.763
What?

12:51.764 --> 12:53.736
Yes. She said it
would be cheaper to get a new one.

12:53.737 --> 12:55.583
She used the phrase "total internal destruction."

12:55.584 --> 12:56.330
Wow.

12:56.331 --> 12:59.116
I know. I guess that check-engine light
is not just a suggestion.

12:59.117 --> 13:00.067
Not so much.

13:00.068 --> 13:03.187
Although I'm proud. Total internal
destruction -- that sounds badass.

13:03.222 --> 13:04.180
So what's next?

13:04.215 --> 13:06.784
Uh, I guess I turn my evil
power on some new, unsuspecting vehicle.

13:06.785 --> 13:07.883
Do you know what you're gonna get?

13:07.884 --> 13:09.447
No. Any suggestions?

13:10.162 --> 13:11.363
Honestly, I'm not a car guy,

13:11.364 --> 13:12.772
but I can steer you toward a good tractor.

13:12.773 --> 13:14.722
Al right. If I decide to get a tractor,
you're my guy.

13:15.449 --> 13:17.138
Hey, do you need a ride
to work tomorrow?

13:17.139 --> 13:18.556
Phil Henderson's gonna pick me up.

13:18.557 --> 13:20.732
We could drop you off
on the way to the farm.

13:20.733 --> 13:22.323
Well that's nice.
What time are you going?

13:22.324 --> 13:23.414
About 4:45.

13:23.415 --> 13:26.040
No, no, no. That's too early.
I'll take my bike.

13:26.041 --> 13:26.705
You bike?

13:26.706 --> 13:28.376
Well, I don't bike, but I have a bike.

13:28.377 --> 13:30.260
There were about two weeks when Rory was 10

13:30.261 --> 13:31.505
that we were really into biking.

13:31.506 --> 13:32.506
Then we got over it and moved on to roller skating,

13:32.507 --> 13:36.077
but for those two weeks, it was biking all the way.

13:36.078 --> 13:36.869
12 years ago?

13:36.870 --> 13:40.204
Is that how long ago it was? Oh, well. I'll be fine.

13:40.205 --> 13:43.012
They must have the phrase
"it's just like riding a bike" for a reason.

13:43.013 --> 13:45.408
Okay, so, I'm gonna get
a snack. You want to join me?

13:45.409 --> 13:48.939
Uh, actually, no. Sookie made me a salad.

13:49.511 --> 13:52.698
I'm making chicken nuggets.
I won't tell. Come on.

13:59.002 --> 14:00.461
- Hello?
- Hi, mom.

14:00.462 --> 14:01.563
Oh, why so blue?

14:01.564 --> 14:02.400
I'm not blue.

14:02.401 --> 14:03.609
Come on, talk to me.

14:03.610 --> 14:04.759
All I said was, "hi, mom."

14:04.760 --> 14:07.809
Are you missing Logan?
Is he getting back from San Francisco soon?

14:07.810 --> 14:10.015
On Friday, but that's not why I'm blue.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.867
I'm not even blue. Well, I'm not really blue.

14:11.868 --> 14:13.142
Well, why are you not blue?

14:13.143 --> 14:15.700
Well, Paris got into six schools yesterday,

14:15.701 --> 14:17.812
which means she's definitely going to grad school,

14:17.813 --> 14:21.116
and I'm happy for her.
I mean, I'm happy for Lucy and Olivia,

14:21.117 --> 14:23.014
who signed a lease on an apartment in Manhattan well,

14:23.015 --> 14:26.640
near Manhattan. And I'm happy
for this guy in my Shakespeare class

14:26.641 --> 14:28.746
who just got recruited for
a think tank in Washington.

14:28.747 --> 14:30.158
Wow, that's a lot of happy.

14:30.159 --> 14:32.818
Yeah, that's just it. All of a sudden,

14:32.819 --> 14:34.889
everyone seems to know
where they're gonna be next year.

14:34.890 --> 14:36.272
Oh, and you're still waiting to hear?

14:36.273 --> 14:38.805
Yeah. I mean, I really want the Reston.

14:38.806 --> 14:40.771
And I think you're gonna get it, I really do.

14:40.772 --> 14:42.425
But you have other places you're waiting to hear from.

14:43.008 --> 14:45.368
I know, but to live in
New York city and work at the times.

14:45.369 --> 14:47.977
Well, if I say it'll work out, does that help?

14:47.978 --> 14:48.542
Not really.

14:48.543 --> 14:50.324
- Consider it unsaid.
- Thanks.

14:50.325 --> 14:51.612
What kind of think tank?

14:51.613 --> 14:53.146
I know, I know I should have asked,

14:53.147 --> 14:55.562
but I temporarily forgot
your fascination with think tanks.

14:55.563 --> 14:57.252
Does the guy have a big forehead?

14:57.253 --> 14:59.094
I always picture the
think-tank guys with big foreheads.

14:59.095 --> 15:01.795
No, he has a pretty
average-sized forehead. Average to small.

15:01.796 --> 15:02.890
Interesting.

15:02.891 --> 15:04.664
Mm. Hey, why do you sound out of breath?

15:04.665 --> 15:05.608
I don't know.

15:06.009 --> 15:07.302
Did you have too much coffee this morning?

15:07.303 --> 15:09.062
Haven't had any. I didn't go to Luke's.

15:09.580 --> 15:11.082
Oh, I thought you were
going for a second run.

15:11.083 --> 15:12.733
Well, maybe tomorrow.

15:12.734 --> 15:14.698
Mom just do it, I know it's hard,

15:14.699 --> 15:16.215
but you guys need to get over this hump.

15:16.216 --> 15:17.327
I promise I'll go back.

15:17.328 --> 15:19.573
It's just there's been a
lot going on with the car and everything.

15:19.574 --> 15:20.901
Oh, what did gypsy say?

15:21.861 --> 15:23.384
- It's bad.
- Uh-oh.

15:23.385 --> 15:25.635
- Doorknobs.
- As in "dead as"?

15:25.636 --> 15:27.947
- That's right.
- Why? How?

15:27.948 --> 15:29.868
Oh, ours is not to wonder why.

15:29.869 --> 15:30.998
But it was so young.

15:30.999 --> 15:31.925
I know.

15:31.926 --> 15:34.586
It just seems like
yesterday that we went to pick it out.

15:34.587 --> 15:35.190
Yeah.

15:35.191 --> 15:37.101
Oh. So new car, huh?

15:37.102 --> 15:39.713
You should get a DeLorean like in "back to the future."

15:39.714 --> 15:41.085
It's on the list right behind the Batmobile.

15:41.086 --> 15:43.078
Although I'm enjoying the whole biking thing

15:43.079 --> 15:43.955
What biking thing?

15:43.956 --> 15:45.392
I'm biking to work right now.

15:45.393 --> 15:46.556
What, now? Mom.

15:46.557 --> 15:48.169
- What?
- Pull over.

15:48.170 --> 15:50.330
- No!
-That's dangerous.

15:50.331 --> 15:53.811
Oh, I'm fine. I've been
talking to you with a little ear thingy.

15:53.812 --> 15:55.094
Well, pull over right now.

15:55.095 --> 15:57.838
Okay, I'm pulling over, pulling over. Okay, I pulled over.

15:57.839 --> 15:59.365
Yeah, I know you're not. I'm hanging up.

15:59.366 --> 16:00.657
Okay, bye!

16:03.060 --> 16:04.667
Hey, anything good?

16:04.668 --> 16:10.445
- Um, here's one that comes
loaded with an entertainment pkg.
- "Package."

16:10.446 --> 16:12.835
Right. Satellite radio, six-cd changer.

16:12.836 --> 16:15.686
I'm just not sure if these
are cars or really expensive stereos.

16:15.687 --> 16:17.637
Ooh, you should get a convertible.

16:17.638 --> 16:19.485
I'm not a convertible person.

16:19.486 --> 16:21.077
What is a convertible person?

16:21.457 --> 16:23.075
You know, too tan, bad hair.

16:23.799 --> 16:26.418
Hey, don't put the tomatoes in
until 10 minutes before you serve

16:26.419 --> 16:28.720
Ooh! How about that little sports car?

16:28.721 --> 16:31.784
Yeah, I don't know, I always
feel like sports cars have an attitude,

16:31.785 --> 16:33.628
you know like they think they're cooler than other cars.

16:33.629 --> 16:36.149
That's true, although from
where I'm sitting in my minivan,

16:36.150 --> 16:37.441
they do seem a lot cooler.

16:37.442 --> 16:41.014
So, thanks again for, you know, having Jackson.

16:41.015 --> 16:42.465
I know how difficult he can be.

16:42.466 --> 16:43.461
Oh, he's great.

16:43.462 --> 16:45.070
Good. You can tell me the truth.

16:45.071 --> 16:47.378
I know he's driving you crazy, right?

16:47.379 --> 16:49.399
He's great. We had fun. We watched TV.

16:49.400 --> 16:50.673
He went to bed early. It was fun.

16:50.674 --> 16:53.294
Oh. He's probably on his good behavior.

16:53.295 --> 16:56.304
He woke you up when he
got up this morning, didn't he?

16:56.305 --> 16:57.810
- No.
- He didn't?
- No.

16:57.811 --> 17:00.486
Oh, with all that stomp, stomp, stomping around.

17:00.487 --> 17:02.187
Sookie, is everything okay with you two?

17:02.188 --> 17:04.407
Oh, yeah, yeah. Fine, fine, fine.

17:04.409 --> 17:07.731
He's just kind of getting
on my nerves a little, you know.

17:07.732 --> 17:10.916
I'm just cranky. The little
one's keeping me up at night.

17:10.917 --> 17:14.367
So, talk to me. What are you thinking?

17:14.368 --> 17:15.760
How about a mini?

17:15.761 --> 17:17.362
Oh, how about a Rolls-Royce?

17:17.363 --> 17:18.807
Yeah, I'll consider that.

17:18.808 --> 17:22.875
Or a Bentley, Aston Martin,
Mercedes, a BMW.

17:22.876 --> 17:24.631
What are you doing,
just listing expensive cars?

17:24.632 --> 17:27.214
Take out a second mortgage
on your home. It will be worth it.

17:27.214 --> 17:28.892
Michel, be quiet.

17:28.893 --> 17:30.884
People are impressed by fine automobiles.

17:30.885 --> 17:33.838
It's how the world works.
Don't look at me like that.

17:33.839 --> 17:35.644
I didn't make the rules. I just play by them.

17:35.645 --> 17:36.790
Yeah, but you drive a golf.

17:36.791 --> 17:38.185
Would you like to give me a raise?

17:38.945 --> 17:42.899
Ignore him! Okay, here's what
I want you to do. Close your eyes.

17:42.900 --> 17:43.655
Ooh, fun.

17:43.656 --> 17:45.985
Now, I want you to imagine your dream car.

17:45.986 --> 17:48.989
It can be anything you want.
You're backing out of the driveway.

17:48.990 --> 17:49.995
You're driving through Stars Hollow.

17:49.996 --> 17:52.993
"Good morning, townspeople!
Top of the morning to you."

17:52.994 --> 17:54.485
Why am I saying "top of the morning"?

17:54.486 --> 17:55.437
It doesn't matter what you say.

17:55.438 --> 17:58.400
It matters what you're in.
Can you see what you're in?

17:58.401 --> 17:59.922
I think I can see it!

17:59.923 --> 18:01.611
Okay, what kind of car is it?

18:01.612 --> 18:03.081
It's not really a car. It's more of a float.

18:03.082 --> 18:03.684
A float?

18:03.685 --> 18:05.835
In the shape of a swan, and I'm dressed all in white.

18:05.836 --> 18:07.126
Okay, that's not a very practical car

18:07.127 --> 18:09.463
Al right. What are you looking at?

18:09.464 --> 18:11.527
I was trying to decide
if you could pull off a Ferrari.

18:11.528 --> 18:12.607
Mm, you can't.

18:12.608 --> 18:14.633
Maybe I'll get a really cool vintage car.

18:14.634 --> 18:18.144
A used car? You cannot be serious.

18:18.145 --> 18:19.396
What's wrong with a used car?

18:19.397 --> 18:21.099
Would you buy a used toilet seat?

18:21.100 --> 18:22.425
It's not really the same thing.

18:22.426 --> 18:23.897
You're sitting in someone else's filth.

18:23.898 --> 18:24.894
With pants on.

18:24.895 --> 18:27.018
One can only hope.

18:27.019 --> 18:27.746
Ew, Michel.

18:27.747 --> 18:29.484
You don't know who drove it before.

18:29.485 --> 18:30.912
No but I think I could have it cleaned.

18:30.913 --> 18:33.394
Aw, you're right and I'm
sure they got out all the sweat,

18:33.395 --> 18:35.873
body odor, and head lice
that a previous owner deposited.

18:35.874 --> 18:38.698
Ew! Shouldn't you be
somewhere, like the reception desk?

18:38.699 --> 18:41.617
- Suit yourself.
- Ew, ew.

18:41.618 --> 18:44.867
I know. And now if you get a cool old vintage car,

18:44.868 --> 18:45.961
I don't think I can sit in it.

18:45.962 --> 18:48.031
Listen, don't worry. I'm getting a new car.

18:48.032 --> 18:50.267
I have more money now than I did eight years ago,

18:50.268 --> 18:54.208
and I can afford something
nice, you know, with all the perks.

18:54.209 --> 18:55.368
Yeah, that makes sense.

18:55.369 --> 18:57.026
I just don't know where to start.

18:57.027 --> 18:58.462
I wish I could be more helpful.

18:58.463 --> 19:01.201
- You know this is something Luke would be good at.
-Yeah

19:01.202 --> 19:03.988
I mean, in the old days,
you know, before everything,

19:03.989 --> 19:04.834
when we were just friends,

19:04.835 --> 19:06.847
this is something I'd ask for his help with.

19:06.848 --> 19:08.490
Well, I mean, maybe you could.

19:08.491 --> 19:09.913
Could I? I couldn't. Could I?

19:09.914 --> 19:11.478
You're talking. You're friends again

19:11.479 --> 19:13.520
Well, sort of friends. We have a long way to go

19:13.521 --> 19:14.921
Well, you will be eventually.

19:14.922 --> 19:17.080
You think something like this
would help us get over the hump?

19:17.081 --> 19:20.134
Yeah, and you've got a
built-in safe topic of conversation.

19:20.135 --> 19:21.960
Yeah. Maybe I will.

19:21.961 --> 19:23.534
Great. I think it's a great idea.

19:23.535 --> 19:25.235
All right, me too. I'll let you know how it goes.

19:25.236 --> 19:32.093
Okay, I'll be here.
Ooh. Hello? Hey, Jackson.

19:32.094 --> 19:34.545
No. Whoa. Wait a -- wait a minute.

19:34.546 --> 19:37.661
Wait, wait, whoa, whoa. You did what?

19:47.592 --> 19:52.012
Hey. It's Lorelai. It's me. Hi.  Are you busy?

19:52.013 --> 19:55.777
Um, no, no, no. I just
had a -- I had a quick question.

19:55.778 --> 19:58.622
It's kind of a favor, really.
Um, my car is totally shot,

19:58.623 --> 20:00.435
and I need to buy a new car, and I just

20:00.436 --> 20:03.008
don't know anything about it,
and I thought maybe sometime

20:03.009 --> 20:06.211
and if you don't have time,
it's really no big deal  but ma today?

20:06.212 --> 20:10.555
Oh...yeah. I mean, it doesn't have to sure.

20:10.556 --> 20:16.361
Yeah, we'll go look. Um, I don't know, like 1:30?

20:16.362 --> 20:21.239
Can you pick me up at the inn? Hey, thanks. Bye.

20:25.502 --> 20:29.198
I was gonna put the radio on,
but it's been pretty static-y lately.

20:29.199 --> 20:30.499
Oh, I'm fine. I don't need music.

20:30.500 --> 20:31.747
Yeah? Okay.

20:33.506 --> 20:35.124
Thanks again for agreeing to come

20:35.125 --> 20:35.965
No problem.

20:35.966 --> 20:38.565
And again, I mean, it didn't
have to be, you know, today.

20:38.566 --> 20:41.587
Oh, no, you know, the diner was slow,

20:41.588 --> 20:43.455
and you can't keep riding that bike around.

20:43.456 --> 20:45.646
Why does everyone act like I'm a really bad biker?

20:45.647 --> 20:47.615
No, hey, I didn't mean it that way.

20:47.616 --> 20:48.692
- I'm just kidding.
- Oh.

20:48.693 --> 20:49.743
- It was a joke.
- Okay.

20:52.732 --> 20:54.196
So, um, April left, right?

20:54.197 --> 20:55.906
Yeah, but she'll be back in June.

20:55.907 --> 20:57.096
Oh, for the big boat trip?

20:57.097 --> 20:58.230
- Right, right.
- That's gonna be fun.

20:58.231 --> 21:00.016
- Yeah.
- Are you excited?

21:00.017 --> 21:01.426
- Yeah
- Oh, good.

21:08.687 --> 21:09.848
You know, I don't mind a little static.

21:09.849 --> 21:11.672
I was gonna say, it actually doesn't work that bad.

21:20.652 --> 21:21.443
Have a nice life!

21:21.444 --> 21:23.106
Doyle, is everything okay?

21:23.107 --> 21:24.575
Oh, yeah, everything's great.

21:24.576 --> 21:26.780
My girlfriend of 2 1/2 years
just broke up with me,

21:26.781 --> 21:27.943
but other than that...

21:27.944 --> 21:28.970
She did? Why?

21:28.971 --> 21:29.971
Who knows? Maybe because she's psycho!

21:29.972 --> 21:32.533
I am not psycho!

21:32.534 --> 21:33.433
Oh, yes, you are!

21:33.434 --> 21:34.139
What happened?

21:34.140 --> 21:35.294
Take that back!

21:35.295 --> 21:37.721
Ask Paris. I will not take it back because

21:37.722 --> 21:39.587
you are a certifiable nut job!

21:39.588 --> 21:43.527
And, hey, if you find out
why we broke up, let me know.

21:43.528 --> 21:44.891
Oh, but, Doyle, where are you gonna go?

21:44.892 --> 21:47.489
Crashing on my metro
editor's couch for a couple of days,

21:47.490 --> 21:50.354
then I'll be back for my stuff. See you around.

21:50.355 --> 21:52.138
See you around.

21:59.218 --> 21:59.935
Is he gone?

21:59.936 --> 22:02.340
Yeah. What happened?

22:02.341 --> 22:04.764
- We broke up.
- But why?

22:04.765 --> 22:06.440
I have a really big decision to make,

22:06.441 --> 22:08.113
and I'm not about to let him influence it.

22:08.114 --> 22:10.665
Was he trying to pressure
you into staying in Connecticut next year?

22:11.010 --> 22:14.617
Well, no, not overtly, 
but it was in the air.

22:14.618 --> 22:17.572
And statistically,
taking into account my geographic

22:17.573 --> 22:18.986
and socioeconomic background,

22:18.987 --> 22:21.830
the chances of me remaining
with my college boyfriend are slim.

22:22.344 --> 22:24.337
So how am I gonna feel in 20 years
when I look back

22:24.338 --> 22:26.121
and realize that I based
such a huge decision

22:26.122 --> 22:29.366
on some college guy who may or may
not make the holiday newsletter cutoff?

22:29.791 --> 22:30.753
But you love him.

22:30.754 --> 22:32.691
- Yeah, well, I'll deal.
- Paris.

22:32.692 --> 22:35.075
- Look, I really don't want to talk about it, okay?
- Okay.

22:35.076 --> 22:39.030
The good news is I came up
with a point system to evaluate

22:39.031 --> 22:41.819
each institution based on faculty, earning potential,

22:41.820 --> 22:44.332
location, prestige, and perception of prestige,

22:44.333 --> 22:46.301
which I've decided is worth two points.

22:46.302 --> 22:48.747
I'm not proud of that but
like you taught me with your U. .

22:48.748 --> 22:50.002
Penn reaction, that's how the world works

22:50.003 --> 22:52.001
Well, I'm glad to see you're making progress.

22:52.002 --> 22:55.612
As if. Three more acceptances. It's crazy.

22:55.613 --> 22:57.711
I mean I always thought that I'd be able to decide

22:57.712 --> 22:59.963
between medicine and law
based on the quality of schools

22:59.964 --> 23:02.741
I was offered entrance to,
but at this point, it's a toss-up. 

23:02.776 --> 23:03.476
Everyone wants me.

23:03.477 --> 23:04.908
Well, I'm sure you'll make
the right decision.

23:04.909 --> 23:07.392
Of course I will. What do
you think the point system's for?

23:08.048 --> 23:12.131
Right. So, the mail got here.
Anything for me?

23:12.132 --> 23:13.114
Nothing from the times.

23:13.115 --> 23:14.827
It'll come.

23:14.828 --> 23:17.243
Yeah, I know. It's just waiting sucks.

23:17.244 --> 23:18.063
Yeah, it does.

23:18.064 --> 23:21.276
Hey, it's Lucy! I just
wanted to give you a heads up for tonight,

23:21.277 --> 23:22.981
8:00 P.M., Rich Man's Shoe.

23:22.982 --> 23:24.538
Get ready to toast Glenda.

23:24.539 --> 23:26.769
That's what we named
our new apartment. I'll tell you why later.

23:26.770 --> 23:28.530
They named their new apartment?

23:28.531 --> 23:29.249
I guess so.

23:29.250 --> 23:32.362
Weird. So, you're gonna go?

23:32.363 --> 23:35.184
Yeah, I was going to. Do you want to come?

23:35.185 --> 23:36.067
I might as well.

23:36.068 --> 23:37.624
I mean Doyle and I were
supposed to see a movie

23:37.625 --> 23:38.962
but guess that's not gonna happen.

23:38.997 --> 23:41.272
- Paris, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. 

23:41.277 --> 23:43.839
Trust me, it's not like I've been
dying to see "Blades of Glory" anyway.

23:43.840 --> 23:46.577
I'd better get started on my
phone calls for the alumni surveys.

24:02.084 --> 24:03.721
I was admiring it, you know?

24:03.722 --> 24:06.645
And then I got to thinking
that I could make Martha one,

24:06.646 --> 24:08.958
so I picked it up to see
what the support system was like,

24:08.959 --> 24:12.471
only it was heavier than
I thought, and, well, I dropped it.

24:12.472 --> 24:13.270
You dropped it.

24:13.271 --> 24:15.009
Yes. And then I fell on it.

24:15.010 --> 24:15.721
Jackson.

24:15.722 --> 24:17.177
I was trying to catch it!

24:17.178 --> 24:18.553
You broke the only thing from

24:18.554 --> 24:20.549
Lorelai's childhood that she actually liked!

24:20.550 --> 24:22.186
I know. I know!

24:22.221 --> 24:24.000
- How could you?
- It was an accident.

24:24.012 --> 24:25.414
Well why did you have to touch it?

24:25.415 --> 24:27.084
I told you, I was just looking at it.

24:27.085 --> 24:29.019
Well, you look with your eyes,
not with your hands.

24:29.020 --> 24:32.007
Well, maybe we could,
you know, find a similar dollhouse.

24:32.042 --> 24:32.819
Oh, good idea.

24:32.820 --> 24:34.018
Let's just sneak it in in the middle of

24:34.019 --> 24:35.531
the night like we did with Davey's goldfish.

24:35.532 --> 24:38.951
I'm just trying to think.
Maybe I could try and put it back together?

24:38.952 --> 24:40.285
Yeah, you're so handy.

24:40.286 --> 24:42.547
Okay, you know what? That's enough.

24:42.548 --> 24:43.294
What's enough?

24:43.295 --> 24:45.654
I know what this is
about, and it's not this dollhouse

24:45.655 --> 24:46.525
Of course it is.

24:46.526 --> 24:50.006
No, it's not. This is about me
lying to you and you getting pregnant.

24:50.007 --> 24:51.222
What are you talking about?

24:51.223 --> 24:55.082
All this anger you have
toward me. That's where this is coming from.

24:55.083 --> 24:57.592
It's not. I told you I'm excited about the baby.

24:57.593 --> 24:59.387
I know but that's not the same as forgiving me,

24:59.388 --> 25:00.345
which you haven't done.

25:00.346 --> 25:01.767
- Yes, I have.
- No, you haven't.

25:01.768 --> 25:03.250
- I have.
- You haven't.
- I have

25:03.251 --> 25:05.542
- You haven't.
-  Fine, I haven't! Are you happy?

25:05.543 --> 25:06.777
No, I'm not.

25:06.778 --> 25:11.731
Well... I don't want to be mad. I don't.

25:15.758 --> 25:19.270
It's just that every time
my feet hurt or my back gets sore or

25:19.271 --> 25:21.726
Davey and Martha have a tantrum or get the chicken pox,

25:21.727 --> 25:24.429
I get scared about having a third kid.

25:24.430 --> 25:26.990
And then I feel bad for feeling like that,

25:26.991 --> 25:29.461
and then I get mad at you for making me feel like that.

25:29.462 --> 25:33.629
I understand. I do. Heck, I'm still mad at myself.

25:33.630 --> 25:38.813
It's just that at some point,
you are gonna forgive me eventually, right?

25:38.814 --> 25:42.687
It's just sometimes it feels really overwhelming.

25:42.688 --> 25:45.256
I know, but you got to let me back in.

25:45.257 --> 25:48.695
- I want to. I do.
- Okay.

25:49.396 --> 25:55.781
Okay. You were thinking
about making a dollhouse for Martha?

25:55.782 --> 25:57.324
She'd really like that, wouldn't she?

25:58.842 --> 26:06.712
Yeah. She would. Boy,
you really plowed into that thing.

26:06.713 --> 26:09.293
- Oh, yeah.
- Hm

26:09.917 --> 26:10.819
- Hmm.
- No?

26:10.820 --> 26:13.987
No. Sorry it's taking so long.

26:13.988 --> 26:16.848
No, not at all. It's a big
purchase. You're buying a car.

26:16.849 --> 26:18.368
You should take your time. I mean,

26:18.369 --> 26:21.167
I'm sorry if you feel like I'm rushing you

26:21.168 --> 26:22.165
Oh, you're not.

26:22.166 --> 26:24.693
No? Good. Because, you know, I've got plenty of time

26:24.694 --> 26:25.237
Good, me too.

26:25.238 --> 26:28.666
So, um, what didn't you like about that one,

26:28.667 --> 26:31.077
specifically, so we can kind of narrow things down?

26:31.078 --> 26:33.999
Um, the whole thing. I don't know. It's a feeling.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.190
It's hard to explain like with the wrangler,

26:35.191 --> 26:37.767
I just got in and I had a
feeling. I didn't get the feeling there.

26:37.768 --> 26:39.463
- Yeah, right.
- Huh?

26:39.464 --> 26:40.580
- Huh.
- Hmm.

26:40.581 --> 26:43.549
- No, no. I just was clearing my throat.
- Oh.

26:44.050 --> 26:45.399
How about a Prius?

26:45.400 --> 26:47.083
Oh, yeah, I can't. Rory has one.

26:47.084 --> 26:47.811
She doesn't like it?

26:47.812 --> 26:50.155
No, she does. It's just
we made a pact no matching cars.

26:50.156 --> 26:51.832
You know 'cause it's a slippery slope between

26:51.833 --> 26:53.623
matching cars and then matching sweatsuits.

26:53.624 --> 26:55.234
- Of course.
- Huh?

26:55.235 --> 26:56.788
I just said, "of course."

26:56.789 --> 27:00.795
Oh, okay. Yeah I'm sorry
if this is frustrating for you.

27:00.796 --> 27:03.369
Oh, no, no, no. Not at all. It's not frustrating at all.

27:03.370 --> 27:06.989
It's fun. But, I mean, look, if you want to leave

27:06.990 --> 27:09.118
Oh, no, no. No, no, I'm having fun.

27:09.119 --> 27:12.397
Good. Good, good, good.
So, what about a little hatchback?

27:12.398 --> 27:20.810
Oh! Well, let's see here. Hmm.

27:20.811 --> 27:23.203
It's got a power thingy in the console.

27:23.204 --> 27:25.032
That could be convenient, you know,

27:25.033 --> 27:27.345
if I need to use a hair dryer if I'm running late.

27:27.446 --> 27:31.057
- That's useful.
- Oh. Excuse me.

27:31.058 --> 27:32.116
- Yeah okay.
- Be right back.

27:33.118 --> 27:37.978
Make them go car shopping with their exes.

27:37.979 --> 27:39.861
Still awkward, huh?

27:39.862 --> 27:42.378
Still? I'm gonna buy a car just to get out of here.

27:42.379 --> 27:44.716
No, don't. Just leave.

27:44.717 --> 27:47.099
I want to, and I can tell that he wants to,

27:47.100 --> 27:48.510
but neither of us want to say that we want to.

27:48.511 --> 27:49.583
Oh.

27:49.584 --> 27:51.835
Yeah, I don't know how Ryan and Farrah do it,

27:51.836 --> 27:53.378
'cause this whole friendship thing is not working out.

27:53.379 --> 27:56.198
Oh. It'll be possible, eventually.

27:56.199 --> 27:59.533
I guess. I just can't take it anymore. What's going on?

27:59.534 --> 28:01.035
- Hmm?
- You called me.

28:01.036 --> 28:06.337
Oh! Well, um, I just wanted
to see how things were going,

28:06.338 --> 28:08.266
and now you told me really, really bad.

28:08.267 --> 28:10.557
Yeah, add about 10 reallys to that.

28:10.558 --> 28:15.877
Wow, 12. That's, um, wow.
Okay. Well, I'll talk to you later.

28:15.878 --> 28:17.371
Yeah, okay, bye.

28:20.257 --> 28:21.761
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, great.

28:21.762 --> 28:24.387
All right, good. Look, I was talking to the salesman.

28:24.388 --> 28:26.640
He said there's a bunch of other models that way.

28:26.641 --> 28:28.326
- Great.
- Okay, so...

28:36.617 --> 28:37.777
- Well?
- Well.

28:37.778 --> 28:39.632
You've been talking about your jeep all day,

28:39.633 --> 28:40.224
I know.

28:40.225 --> 28:41.287
Comparing other cars to it.

28:41.288 --> 28:42.153
- I know.
- Here it is.

28:43.356 --> 28:44.101
I'm sorry.

28:44.102 --> 28:46.567
But I don't understand. It's the same car.

28:46.568 --> 28:47.659
It's not the same car.

28:47.660 --> 28:48.433
What do you mean?

28:48.434 --> 28:49.815
What do you mean? It's different.

28:49.816 --> 28:51.438
It's not different. It's just a newer model.

28:51.439 --> 28:53.498
No, it's different. The steering wheel,

28:53.499 --> 28:54.991
the seats are different, the cup holder.

28:54.992 --> 28:56.614
Okay there have been improvements.

28:56.615 --> 28:57.595
They made some changes.

28:57.596 --> 28:58.958
- Improvements.
- Says who?

28:58.959 --> 29:01.285
What exactly is bugging you?

29:01.286 --> 29:05.053
It's not bugging me per se. It's just it's different.

29:05.054 --> 29:06.177
I don't get that feeling

29:06.178 --> 29:07.812
- Oh, for god's sake.
- What?

29:07.813 --> 29:09.657
- You're being ridiculous.
- Why?

29:09.658 --> 29:11.826
You don't buy a car based on a feeling.

29:11.827 --> 29:14.315
No. You don't buy a car based on a feeling.

29:14.316 --> 29:16.739
It's not just me. It's the
whole rest of the population

29:16.740 --> 29:18.065
Really? You took a poll,

29:18.066 --> 29:21.171
and you know how everyone else buys their car?

29:21.172 --> 29:22.978
I don't have to. I already
know what they're gonna say.

29:22.979 --> 29:25.131
Well, I am the person buying the car,

29:25.132 --> 29:27.226
and so the only opinion
that matters is mine.

29:27.227 --> 29:28.862
Oh, that is so like you.

29:28.863 --> 29:30.980
I mean this is bathroom tiles all over again.

29:30.981 --> 29:32.508
- I was right about the tile.
- No, you weren't.

29:32.509 --> 29:34.237
The tile was too big for the bathroom.

29:34.238 --> 29:35.937
Tiles are not too big for a bathroom.

29:35.938 --> 29:37.647
You buy the amount of tiles based on

29:37.648 --> 29:39.475
their size that fit into the room you are tiling!

29:39.476 --> 29:40.933
So narrow-minded.

29:40.934 --> 29:43.370
That's not narrow-minded. Okay it's sane,

29:43.371 --> 29:45.509
and here's a news flash for you, okay?

29:45.510 --> 29:48.090
Sports cars don't think
they're better than other cars.

29:48.091 --> 29:51.898
Okay. Hatchbacks don't
have SUV inferiority complexes.

29:52.904 --> 29:55.791
- Now who's ridiculous?
- And sedans aren't afraid to get dirty.

29:55.792 --> 29:57.196
You know what I think it is? That you're hungry.

29:57.197 --> 29:58.017
What? No.

29:58.018 --> 29:59.447
Sometimes you get like this when you're hungry.

29:59.448 --> 29:59.960
I'm not.

29:59.961 --> 30:02.022
I think I have some cookies in here, some Oreos.

30:02.023 --> 30:04.518
I'm not and besides I wouldn't
eat anything that came out of that bag.

30:04.519 --> 30:05.561
They're in a wrapper.

30:05.562 --> 30:08.216
I can't believe you still
haven't cleaned that thing out.

30:08.217 --> 30:08.726
Please.

30:08.727 --> 30:10.671
How much time do you lose
a day looking through that thing?

30:10.672 --> 30:12.529
5, 10 minutes? Multiply that by a year.

30:12.530 --> 30:14.766
I bet you'd gain a month if you
just took an hour and cleaned it out,

30:14.767 --> 30:16.459
but no -- what?

30:16.460 --> 30:18.690
- Nothing.
- You're smiling.

30:18.691 --> 30:21.681
What? No. You've got low blood sugar.

30:21.682 --> 30:26.190
I do not have… okay,
are you gonna buy a car or not?

30:27.302 --> 30:27.781
Not.

30:27.782 --> 30:29.586
Okay can we get out of here, then?

30:29.587 --> 30:30.378
Gladly.

30:30.379 --> 30:33.652
And we're not listening
to any of that crap on the radio.

30:33.653 --> 30:34.605
- It's not crap.
- Yeah, it's crap

30:34.606 --> 30:36.402
It's Air Supply. You
know what you need a milkshake.

30:36.403 --> 30:37.403
- We're not stopping for a milkshake.

30:37.404 --> 30:38.395
- Okay let's rock, paper, scissors.

30:38.396 --> 30:39.773
- No, no, no.
- So you forfeit?
- No, I…

30:39.774 --> 30:40.774
Well, that's how it goes.

30:40.775 --> 30:44.225
If you don't play the game, then you forfeit.

30:44.226 --> 30:44.457
- Let's get you in the car

30:44.458 --> 30:47.318
- That means a giant milkshake for you, my friend.

30:47.319 --> 30:48.415
We're not stopping.

30:48.416 --> 30:52.168
-Chocolate. That's gonna set you up.
-We're not stopping. Not gonna happen.

30:56.562 --> 30:59.054
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Lorelai.
- Hiya.

30:59.055 --> 30:59.921
- How's it going?

30:59.922 --> 31:02.756
Oh, we're just enjoying the afternoon.

31:02.757 --> 31:05.386
It's such A...nice day out. Come join us.

31:05.387 --> 31:05.771
Okay.

31:05.772 --> 31:07.494
Hey, how'd it turn out with Luke?

31:07.495 --> 31:08.840
Oh, he got mad at me.

31:08.841 --> 31:09.368
I'm sorry.

31:09.369 --> 31:12.390
Oh, it was so great. I mean
we've been so polite to each other,

31:12.391 --> 31:13.985
and I knew he was frustrated with me,

31:13.986 --> 31:16.277
and I was definitely
frustrated with him, and finally,

31:16.278 --> 31:18.664
he snapped, and we
started bickering, and it was nice.

31:18.665 --> 31:20.570
- Ah.
- More normal, you know?

31:20.571 --> 31:21.995
The fighting got you over the hump.

31:21.996 --> 31:23.546
Yeah. I cannot find a car, though.

31:23.547 --> 31:24.416
Did you see anything you like?

31:24.417 --> 31:28.208
No. I mean kind of,
but they all have this new-car smell,

31:28.209 --> 31:29.659
which apparently people like, but I don't like it.

31:29.660 --> 31:32.862
I like the way my old car
smelled and the way the zipper got stuck

31:32.863 --> 31:34.473
on the window and the little place where

31:34.474 --> 31:36.073
Rory signed her name in permanent marker.

31:36.074 --> 31:37.474
Lots of memories, huh?

31:37.475 --> 31:40.596
It was the first new car I bought
and the car I taught Rory to drive in,.

31:40.597 --> 31:44.618
and I know I have to move on.
I know that whatever new car,

31:44.619 --> 31:47.146
tractor, float, I get will be great.

31:47.147 --> 31:49.508
It's just been a more
emotional experience than I thought

31:49.509 --> 31:51.849
-Makes sense.
- Yeah. It does.

31:52.150 --> 31:53.559
What's wrong with you two?

31:53.560 --> 31:56.384
We have to tell you
something, and it's really bad timing

31:56.385 --> 31:57.890
because we're talking about memories,

31:57.891 --> 32:01.640
and the thing we have to tell
you was associated with a lot of memories,

32:01.641 --> 32:03.681
but we have to tell you, so I'm just gonna tell you.

32:03.682 --> 32:05.981
- What is it?
- Jackson broke your dollhouse.

32:05.982 --> 32:08.740
Oh. How broke?

32:08.741 --> 32:11.635
In a box in pieces. Trust me, you don't want to look.

32:12.657 --> 32:14.653
- Oh.
- I am so sorry.

32:14.654 --> 32:17.673
No, it's my fault. I had you on edge.

32:17.674 --> 32:20.718
I had him on edge. We're both so sorry.

32:20.719 --> 32:22.559
Oh, no, that's okay. It was an accident.

32:22.560 --> 32:24.584
Well, the good news -- not good news.

32:24.585 --> 32:28.011
I mean, the not-quite-so-devastating news is that

32:28.012 --> 32:31.346
we found someone online
that is apparently a wizard with,

32:31.347 --> 32:32.847
you know, restoring dollhouses,

32:32.848 --> 32:35.061
and we're driving all the pieces over there tomorrow.

32:35.062 --> 32:38.046
Oh, thanks. I'm sure it'll be fine.

32:38.047 --> 32:39.963
Yeah, everything can be fixed, huh?

32:39.964 --> 32:43.544
Yeah. Is that why you guys are sitting out here?

32:43.545 --> 32:44.231
Pretty much.

32:44.232 --> 32:46.817
Oh. You want to head on in?

32:46.818 --> 32:48.127
Sounds good. Yow.

32:53.778 --> 32:55.964
That's a living room,
and our bedrooms will be here.

32:55.965 --> 32:57.360
We're gonna put partitions up.

32:57.361 --> 32:59.262
Aesthetically, Japanese screens would be nice.

32:59.263 --> 33:01.261
But privacy-wise, we definitely need partitions.

33:01.262 --> 33:03.239
- Well, it looks great.
-Oh, it's not great.

33:03.240 --> 33:05.115
- owhere near great.
-What it is, is cheap.

33:05.116 --> 33:07.306
Which is even better than great since the gallery

33:07.307 --> 33:08.903
is paying me $21,000 a year,

33:08.904 --> 33:11.156
and I'm gonna have to
start paying off student loans.

33:11.157 --> 33:11.901
How, I don't know

33:11.902 --> 33:13.574
We'll make a budget. You'll swing it.

33:13.575 --> 33:14.481
I hope so.

33:14.482 --> 33:16.133
Is it near the subway?

33:16.134 --> 33:16.859
That's the best part.

33:16.860 --> 33:19.540
It's right near the "W"
then you transfer to the 7 or the "N."

33:19.541 --> 33:21.871
I wouldn't say it's the
best part. It's definitely a schlepp.

33:21.872 --> 33:23.011
But it's a doable schlepp.

33:23.012 --> 33:25.890
Totally doable. If you get
the Reston, you should look in our area.

33:25.891 --> 33:30.234
Oh, I definitely will. Um,
hey, is there student housing at Columbia?

33:30.235 --> 33:32.332
- you got into Columbia?
- Yeah.

33:32.333 --> 33:35.478
You should go! How much
fun will it be when we're all in the city?

33:35.479 --> 33:37.415
Maybe. Are you gonna finish that?

33:37.416 --> 33:44.180
- Uh, no. Go for it.
- Olivia, darts?

33:44.181 --> 33:46.460
You're on. Let's play for
the bedroom with the window.

33:51.375 --> 33:55.881
- Paris, are you okay?
- Me? Yeah, sure.

33:57.194 --> 33:57.790
- Come on.

34:00.198 --> 34:02.377
I just miss him, you know. It's hard.

34:02.678 --> 34:06.659
I know. You didn't have to break up with him, though.

34:06.660 --> 34:08.346
Yes. I did.

34:09.286 --> 34:11.143
Well, if you thought that he was pressuring you,

34:11.143 --> 34:12.859
couldn't you have just talked to him about it?

34:12.860 --> 34:16.391
- He wasn't.
- Well, then why?

34:16.391 --> 34:20.326
It was me, okay? Doyle said to make my decision.

34:20.327 --> 34:24.136
He said not to worry
about him. He said wherever I went,

34:24.137 --> 34:29.856
we'd work it out. So I tried,
you know, not to think about him,

34:29.857 --> 34:33.455
to take him out of the equation, but I couldn't.

34:33.456 --> 34:35.911
Every time I tried to evaluate a school,

34:35.913 --> 34:38.297
I'd immediately think about it in relation to Doyle.

34:38.297 --> 34:41.574
"How close is it to him?
"Is there a good newspaper nearby?

34:41.576 --> 34:42.960
What will the commute be like?"

34:42.962 --> 34:45.364
Well, those are all valid questions.

34:45.364 --> 34:46.484
No, they're not.

34:46.485 --> 34:50.402
This decision is the culmination
of everything I've ever worked for,

34:50.402 --> 34:53.964
everything. I should choose
a school based on its merits,

34:53.965 --> 34:56.501
not based on its proximity to some guy.

34:56.502 --> 34:58.103
But Doyle's not just some guy.

34:58.104 --> 35:04.141
I know. But I'm only 22.
This wasn't supposed to happen yet.

35:04.142 --> 35:07.660
I wasn't supposed to meet the guy until I was 30 and

35:07.661 --> 35:10.470
clerking for a federal judge
or finishing up my residency

35:10.471 --> 35:14.393
and when I knew where
I'd be when I was ready to settle down.

35:14.394 --> 35:15.636
Yeah, but you can't plan everything.

35:15.637 --> 35:17.929
I mean, you fell in love. That's a good thing.

35:17.930 --> 35:21.333
Are you willing to make
a decision this big based on Logan?

35:21.334 --> 35:23.368
Well, actually, we talked about it,

35:23.369 --> 35:25.448
and we're gonna factor each other in.

35:25.449 --> 35:26.524
What does that mean?

35:26.525 --> 35:29.730
It just means we're gonna take each other

35:29.731 --> 35:31.353
into consideration when we make decisions.

35:31.354 --> 35:35.128
Okay. So carry that thought out.

35:35.129 --> 35:38.191
Let's say you get The New York Times
fellowship and

35:38.192 --> 35:41.095
Logan's meetings in San Francisco go incredibly well

35:41.130 --> 35:44.602
and he wants to move there.
Do you take a job in San Francisco?

35:44.603 --> 35:46.894
The chronicle is a perfectly adequate paper.

35:46.895 --> 35:48.688
Or do you go to The New York Times?

35:50.557 --> 35:51.280
The New York Times.

35:51.281 --> 35:54.204
Then we're saying
the same thing, aren't we?

35:54.205 --> 35:55.388
No, not at all.

35:55.389 --> 35:59.127
You're saying your career
is your priority over your relationship.

35:59.128 --> 35:59.993
They're both priorities.

35:59.994 --> 36:01.503
But your career comes first.

36:01.504 --> 36:03.887
Well, I didn't say it comes first. I --

36:03.888 --> 36:07.086
I'm just not ready to make any sacrifices in that area yet.

36:07.087 --> 36:10.471
But you are willing to
make sacrifices in your relationship.

36:10.472 --> 36:13.956
Hence, your career is
more important to you, just like me.

36:13.957 --> 36:16.076
Well, I wouldn't say "more important."

36:16.077 --> 36:19.059
I guess I just thought that if Logan and

36:19.060 --> 36:21.421
I have to do long-distance again, we'll make it work.

36:21.422 --> 36:29.365
Sure. Maybe. Then again,
choosing to be apart might be...

36:29.366 --> 36:31.514
choosing to be apart.

36:56.326 --> 36:59.911
- Oh! Hey, Luke.
- Hey, Jackson.

36:59.912 --> 37:02.731
- How you been, man?
- Uh, not too bad.

37:02.732 --> 37:03.291
You want to come in?

37:03.292 --> 37:04.891
Uh, no, that's okay. Is Lorelai here?

37:04.892 --> 37:07.395
Yeah, hang on. Lorelai, it's Luke!

37:07.396 --> 37:10.175
We thought you were the
pizza guy. We're getting pizza tonight,

37:10.176 --> 37:11.890
with pepperoni and meatballs and sausage

37:11.891 --> 37:14.213
and those extra-crispy, cheesy garlic knots,

37:14.214 --> 37:16.037
and we're eating everything on the couch.

37:16.038 --> 37:18.047
Well, that sounds...fun.

37:18.048 --> 37:20.341
Yeah, right! Chicken-nugget appetizer?

37:20.342 --> 37:21.390
I'm good, I'm good.

37:21.391 --> 37:22.399
- Hi.
- Hi.

37:23.402 --> 37:24.553
Oh, well, good to see you, buddy.

37:24.554 --> 37:26.249
Yeah, you too.

37:26.450 --> 37:27.677
What's going on?

37:27.678 --> 37:31.225
Okay, here's the deal. I borrowed Kirk's computer,

37:31.226 --> 37:32.364
and Zach got me on this craigslist thing,

37:32.365 --> 37:35.895
and I found a 1999 jeep wrangler for sale.

37:35.896 --> 37:38.719
The guy actually doesn't live
too far from here, so I went to see it.

37:38.720 --> 37:41.614
It looks like it's in pretty
good shape. So I ran the VIN number.

37:41.615 --> 37:44.126
It's got a clean history
- no accidents, no failed emissions.

37:44.127 --> 37:46.166
And the guy said he kept it up pretty good,

37:46.167 --> 37:48.999
and there's nothing really
wrong with it. So I took it for a test drive,

37:49.000 --> 37:51.640
and it drove fine. So if you want to keep your old car,

37:51.641 --> 37:54.454
for whatever crazy feeling it gives you, okay?

37:54.455 --> 37:56.708
Then buy this guy's car, send it to gypsy.

37:56.709 --> 37:59.062
She'll take the engine out, put it in the old car,

37:59.063 --> 38:01.438
which makes absolutely no sense because you'd basically

38:01.439 --> 38:03.875
be paying the same amount of money to fix your old car

38:03.876 --> 38:06.280
as you would be paying to get into a new one.

38:06.281 --> 38:07.468
But I'd still have my car.

38:07.469 --> 38:09.647
Yeah, gypsy said it'll take about two weeks to finish.

38:09.648 --> 38:10.648
Here's the number of the guy, Larry. That's his name.

38:10.649 --> 38:14.324
I already negotiated him down 1,500 bucks.

38:14.325 --> 38:17.148
Tell him you're Lorelai, Luke's friend. He'll know.

38:17.149 --> 38:17.736
Thanks, I will.

38:17.737 --> 38:19.926
It's still a completely ridiculous idea.

38:19.927 --> 38:20.560
I know.

38:20.561 --> 38:23.579
Al right. And, you know, in the meantime,

38:23.580 --> 38:25.668
if you're still riding
that bike around, come by the diner.

38:25.669 --> 38:26.733
I'll put some air in your tires.

38:26.734 --> 38:27.851
I don't need air in my tires.

38:27.852 --> 38:29.702
You need air, and you need a light and

38:29.703 --> 38:31.354
a bell so people know you're coming.

38:31.355 --> 38:32.967
What if I don't want people to know I'm coming?

38:32.968 --> 38:33.992
I'm putting on a bell!

38:33.993 --> 38:34.808
No, you're not!

38:34.809 --> 38:36.316
What do you have against bells?

38:36.317 --> 38:37.420
I don't like 'em.

38:37.421 --> 38:40.363
Well, you don't have to
like them. They're a safety feature.

38:40.364 --> 38:41.584
I want a horn!

38:41.585 --> 38:43.881
Fine you want a horn,
I'll get you a horn. Are you happy?

38:43.882 --> 38:46.526
Jeez.

38:55.841 --> 38:59.795
So, I don't know where
I'll be, but I think I know what I'll be.

38:59.796 --> 39:01.711
- Really?
- A doctor.

39:01.712 --> 39:03.507
Oh, Paris, that's great.

39:03.508 --> 39:05.461
It's always been my dream, you know?

39:05.462 --> 39:08.484
Last night when I was lying
in bed watching the ceiling spin…

39:08.485 --> 39:10.359
I told you that last drink was a mistake.

39:10.360 --> 39:13.778
It just became perfectly clear.
I've always wanted to be a doctor,

39:13.779 --> 39:16.053
for as long as I remember. When I was a kid,

39:16.054 --> 39:18.488
I used to cut the heads
off my dolls to see what was inside.

39:18.489 --> 39:20.637
I'm guessing you didn't put that on your applications.

39:20.638 --> 39:24.441
I let myself get swayed by
the promise of black-card corporate America,

39:24.442 --> 39:26.614
but the truth is I want to be a physician --

39:26.615 --> 39:28.621
always have, always will.

39:28.622 --> 39:31.153
Well, I think it's a very noble profession.

39:31.154 --> 39:33.740
Oh, yeah, definitely.
It's as close to being god as you can get.

39:33.741 --> 39:37.083
- Hey, Paris. Hello, Rory.
- Hey, Doyle.

39:37.084 --> 39:37.794
What are you doing here?

39:37.795 --> 39:38.621
I live here.

39:38.622 --> 39:41.080
Uh, yeah, but we agreed
you'd be the one to move out.

39:41.081 --> 39:42.569
About that -- I changed my mind.

39:42.570 --> 39:44.158
It's inappropriate for my best friend

39:44.159 --> 39:45.756
to be living alone with my ex-boyfriend.

39:45.757 --> 39:47.774
I don't want to live alone with her. No offense, Rory.

39:47.775 --> 39:48.370
None taken.

39:48.371 --> 39:50.420
We can't all live together. We're broken up.

39:50.421 --> 39:51.979
Actually I changed my mind about that, too.

39:51.980 --> 39:54.085
What do you mean? What is he talking about?

39:54.086 --> 39:55.060
I don't think he wants to break up.

39:55.061 --> 39:57.106
That's right I don't. Oh, and by the way,

39:57.107 --> 39:58.107
I think you got into two more med schools --

39:58.108 --> 40:01.011
Washington University and Duke.

40:01.012 --> 40:04.342
You know I never saw myself
living in St. Louis or North Carolina,

40:04.343 --> 40:05.805
but who knows? Maybe I'll end up there.

40:05.806 --> 40:06.806
What are you talking about?

40:06.807 --> 40:10.152
I love you, Paris Geller. You are the strongest,

40:10.153 --> 40:12.312
most infuriating, most exciting woman

40:12.313 --> 40:14.155
I have ever met in my entire life,

40:14.156 --> 40:16.620
and there is no way I'm gonna let you go.

40:16.621 --> 40:17.423
You don't have a choice.

40:17.424 --> 40:19.590
Sure, I do. Just because
you don't want to base your decision

40:19.591 --> 40:21.690
on me doesn't mean I can't base my decision on you.

40:21.691 --> 40:22.637
That's absurd.

40:22.638 --> 40:24.754
Anywhere you go, I'm going.

40:24.755 --> 40:26.376
We're too young to do this!

40:26.377 --> 40:29.302
Maybe you are, but I'm
older and a heck of a lot more mature.

40:33.639 --> 40:38.603
So... you're saying that if I go to Alaska,

40:38.604 --> 40:39.959
you're gonna move there, too?

40:39.960 --> 40:43.070
Well, I've always wanted to go dogsledding.

40:43.071 --> 40:45.920
That's ridiculous, with your low threshold for cold.

40:45.921 --> 40:46.961
I'll wear warmer clothes.

40:46.962 --> 40:48.240
You're not thinking clearly.

40:48.241 --> 40:50.447
I've never been clearer.

40:50.448 --> 40:54.262
Keep in mind I'm not going to look
for a school with good newspapers nearby.

40:54.263 --> 40:57.448
Keep in mind that the internet is taking
off and I can write freelance from anywhere.

40:57.449 --> 40:59.990
So that's your plan --
to be a freelance journalist?

40:59.991 --> 41:02.172
No, my plan is to be with you.

41:02.173 --> 41:03.551
Why are you doing this?

41:03.552 --> 41:05.195
Because I love you, okay?

41:05.196 --> 41:06.853
Well, I love you, too.

41:06.854 --> 41:09.360
- That was sweet.
- Shut up.
