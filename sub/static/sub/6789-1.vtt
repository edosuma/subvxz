<i>The itsy-bitsy spider</i>
<i>Crawled up the waterspout</i>

00:29.863 --> 00:35.701
<i>Down came the rain</i>
<i>And washed the spider out</i>

00:35.785 --> 00:40.706
<i>Out came the sun</i>
<i>And dried up all the rain</i>

00:40.790 --> 00:45.169
<i>And the itsy-bitsy spider</i>
<i>Crawled up the spout again</i>

00:45.253 --> 00:48.547
Jesse, you get in this house right now!

00:48.631 --> 00:50.007
Oh, Mom.

00:50.091 --> 00:51.467
Right now.

01:34.719 --> 01:35.803
No!

01:49.818 --> 01:52.027
Who are you?

01:52.112 --> 01:55.614
Well, I'm Mrs Voorhees,
an old friend of the Christys.

01:57.826 --> 02:00.911
No, no. They're all dead.
They're all dead.

02:00.995 --> 02:02.454
All right, I'll go look.

02:02.539 --> 02:05.958
Please don't leave me.
He'll kill you too!

02:06.084 --> 02:07.668
I'm not afraid.

02:12.632 --> 02:13.715
No!

02:17.887 --> 02:20.305
Did you know
that a young boy drowned

02:20.390 --> 02:22.724
the year before
those two others were killed?

02:22.809 --> 02:25.477
The counsellors
weren't paying any attention.

02:25.562 --> 02:28.856
They were making love
while that young boy drowned.

02:30.733 --> 02:32.484
His name was Jason.

02:34.779 --> 02:38.365
I was working the day that
it happened. Preparing meals.

02:38.449 --> 02:40.951
Here. I was the cook.

02:41.035 --> 02:44.371
Jason should have been
watched, every minute!

02:44.455 --> 02:45.581
He was...

02:49.085 --> 02:51.336
He wasn't a very good swimmer.

02:53.965 --> 02:55.924
We can go now, dear.

02:58.553 --> 02:59.887
No!

03:03.099 --> 03:06.560
My sweet, innocent Jason.

03:07.770 --> 03:10.606
My only child.

03:10.690 --> 03:11.982
Jason.

03:16.654 --> 03:21.491
You let him drown.
You never paid any attention!

03:21.576 --> 03:24.369
Look what you did to him.

03:24.454 --> 03:28.457
Look what you did to him!

03:39.135 --> 03:40.219
No!

03:49.187 --> 03:51.313
Kill her, Mommy. Kill her.

03:52.315 --> 03:55.400
She can't hide.
No place to hide.

03:56.152 --> 03:59.112
Get her, Mommy. Get her.

03:59.197 --> 04:00.989
Kill her. Kill her.

05:47.013 --> 05:49.306
Two of my men pulled you out
of the lake. We...

05:49.390 --> 05:50.766
...thought you were dead too.

05:52.852 --> 05:55.228
Do you remember very much?

05:55.313 --> 05:58.231
The boy. Is he dead too?

05:59.275 --> 06:01.902
- Who?
- The boy. Jason.

06:04.280 --> 06:06.365
- Jason?
- In the lake.

06:06.449 --> 06:08.200
The one who attacked me.
The one who

06:08.284 --> 06:10.786
pulled me
underneath the water.

06:12.330 --> 06:15.290
Ma'am, we didn't find any boy.

06:17.126 --> 06:20.629
Then he's still there.

06:37.647 --> 06:38.772
God!

07:01.379 --> 07:02.587
Hello?

07:03.005 --> 07:04.297
Hi, Mom.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.883
I know. I'm sorry.

07:06.968 --> 07:09.845
I meant to call earlier, but I fell asleep.

07:12.682 --> 07:14.349
Really, I'm fine.

07:15.893 --> 07:18.645
I need a little time alone, that's all.

07:23.651 --> 07:27.320
I know you and Dad worry,
and I appreciate that.

07:30.700 --> 07:34.035
Come on, Mom,
we've been through all of this before.

07:35.329 --> 07:40.083
I just have to put my life back together,
and this is the only way I know how.

07:44.964 --> 07:46.631
Look...

07:46.716 --> 07:51.094
Mom, please. It's getting late,
and I really don't want to get into it.

07:51.762 --> 07:54.473
I'll call you tomorrow. Bye.

09:15.721 --> 09:16.805
Mom!

09:18.349 --> 09:19.558
Hello?

11:32.441 --> 11:33.566
Cute.

11:34.610 --> 11:36.695
You want something to eat?

13:56.001 --> 14:00.088
All right, keep your eyes peeled.
I think we're getting close.

14:05.594 --> 14:07.762
Hey, there's a gas station.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.697
Okay, let's call Ted.

14:40.546 --> 14:43.214
Hey, Teddy, buddy!

14:43.299 --> 14:46.259
We just rolled in.
Yeah, yeah, Sandra's here.

14:46.343 --> 14:47.927
Hi, Ted!

14:48.012 --> 14:50.346
Hey, so you gonna come down
and get us or what?

14:50.431 --> 14:52.724
Yeah, okay.
Okay, give me the directions.

14:52.808 --> 14:57.061
Here, wait, wait, wait. All right.
Okay, go ahead, I'm ready.

14:57.146 --> 15:01.566
All right, Old North Road,
and then look for a Dairy Queen?

15:01.650 --> 15:03.610
Okay. And then over...

15:03.694 --> 15:06.988
I told the others.
They didn't believe me.

15:07.823 --> 15:12.035
You're all doomed.

15:19.668 --> 15:22.086
What? Oh, no, nothing.

15:22.171 --> 15:24.339
No, go ahead. No. All right.

15:24.423 --> 15:27.175
So... All right, covered bridge.

15:27.259 --> 15:30.261
Okay. Then what?

15:30.346 --> 15:34.307
All right, so, then past an old cemetery.
All right.

15:34.391 --> 15:36.267
And then...

15:36.352 --> 15:39.687
Left down an old dirt road
for half a mile.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.440
Oh, my God! They're towing us!

15:42.524 --> 15:44.776
Shit! Ted, I'll call you back.

15:44.860 --> 15:47.487
- Hey, wait!
- Hey, mister!

15:50.282 --> 15:54.744
This is my truck! Come on!
This is my truck!

15:55.537 --> 15:58.122
Asshole, this is my truck!

16:01.585 --> 16:02.710
Shit!

16:15.724 --> 16:17.725
Welcome to God's country.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.687
You rat shit!

16:25.359 --> 16:28.444
Thanks, Max!
Max owns the gas station.

16:28.529 --> 16:31.781
- He's crazy too.
- I should have known.

16:31.865 --> 16:34.242
It's great to see you.
It'll be like old times.

16:34.326 --> 16:37.286
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

16:37.371 --> 16:38.913
Help me load my gear and we'll split.

16:43.752 --> 16:45.795
So, Ted, what's the scoop?

16:46.422 --> 16:50.174
I know that guy Paul
that's running the course. He's okay.

16:50.259 --> 16:52.176
He's kind of macho, though.

16:52.261 --> 16:55.221
He takes the whole thing very seriously.

16:55.305 --> 16:58.349
Senior camp counsellor, of course.

16:58.434 --> 17:01.019
We'll probably all get
a Brownie badge ifwe survive.

17:01.103 --> 17:03.229
- lf we survive?
- That's right.

17:03.313 --> 17:05.732
Didn't I tell you you're gonna be
a second assistant?

17:05.816 --> 17:07.608
Oh, no!

17:08.694 --> 17:10.028
Wait, listen, listen.

17:10.112 --> 17:13.031
A bear and a rabbit are in the woods.
Both are taking a dump.

17:13.115 --> 17:14.866
The bear looks down
at the rabbit and says,

17:14.950 --> 17:18.286
"Excuse me, Mr Rabbit,
does shit stick to your fur?"

17:18.369 --> 17:20.872
The rabbit says, "No, Mr. Bear."

17:20.955 --> 17:23.790
So the bear wiped his ass
with the rabbit.

17:26.795 --> 17:28.671
What the heck is that?

17:39.099 --> 17:43.019
- Where did this sucker come from?
- I don't know. Let's move it.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.566
This place is spooky.

17:50.778 --> 17:52.570
It looks like somebody dragged it here.

17:52.654 --> 17:54.405
Yeah, but what for?

18:08.087 --> 18:10.213
Hey, you guys, look at this.

18:17.096 --> 18:20.598
It's Camp Blood. This place is
on the same lake as we're gonna be.

18:20.682 --> 18:22.475
- Camp Blood?
- Isn't that the place...

18:22.559 --> 18:24.727
- Let's get out of here.
- Can't we take a look?

18:24.812 --> 18:26.646
- No way.
- What's the problem?

18:26.730 --> 18:30.775
You don't wanna hear about it, man.
Believe me. Not before lunch.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.829
Need some help?

19:24.913 --> 19:27.957
No, it's okay. I got it. Thanks, anyhow.

20:07.956 --> 20:09.874
Okay, let's settle down.

20:09.958 --> 20:13.085
It's great to have you here
at our new counsellor training centre.

20:13.170 --> 20:16.464
You've all worked as counsellors
at one camp or another.

20:16.548 --> 20:18.883
Terry, Vickie,
you were upstate last summer, right?

20:18.967 --> 20:22.303
Scott! Hi! Good to see you here, buddy.
You need it.

20:23.305 --> 20:27.099
And, Mark, I know we worked
a season or two together, right?

20:27.184 --> 20:30.186
Okay. The rest of you
I'm sure I'll get to know soon enough.

20:30.270 --> 20:32.897
I'm also sure there's one thing
I don't have to tell you.

20:32.981 --> 20:36.442
Being a counsellor isn't the gravy
summer job everybody thinks it is.

20:57.422 --> 20:59.590
And what we're gonna do
over the next two weeks,

20:59.675 --> 21:04.595
if the rest of my staff ever shows up,
is go back to basics.

21:04.680 --> 21:09.976
Survival, first aid, boating,
archery, rifle range, all of it.

21:13.730 --> 21:15.398
What the hell...

21:21.571 --> 21:23.364
I'll be right back.

21:26.034 --> 21:28.703
Hi! I'm late.

21:46.888 --> 21:49.265
What is this crap?
You're supposed to be my assistant.

21:49.349 --> 21:52.893
- Everyone else got here hours ago.
- I said I was sorry.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.228
You did?

21:56.189 --> 21:58.816
I'm sorry. Okay?

21:58.900 --> 22:01.319
- But my car's sick.
- You could have called.

22:01.403 --> 22:04.905
Paul, I tried, but your phones
aren't even working yet.

22:06.575 --> 22:10.911
Okay, get your gear stowed
and help me outside, okay?

22:10.996 --> 22:14.415
Paul, look,
the course starts today, right?

22:14.499 --> 22:16.459
Well, here I am.

22:16.543 --> 22:21.547
And I promise you, I'll never, ever
be late again in my entire life.

22:22.924 --> 22:24.425
Is it a deal?

22:25.218 --> 22:27.762
All right, all right, what the hell.

22:31.433 --> 22:34.268
Ginny, I was starting to worry about you.

22:35.437 --> 22:37.021
Bullshit, Paul.

22:54.831 --> 22:56.999
Ginny, put your car on the lot, okay?

22:57.084 --> 22:59.710
This place looks like a Burger King.

23:00.379 --> 23:01.379
Where was I?

23:01.463 --> 23:04.840
You were about to give your
"Let's keep our shit together" speech.

23:04.925 --> 23:06.217
Mr Holt.

23:07.302 --> 23:09.387
Right, Ted. Right.

23:09.471 --> 23:11.889
Okay, look, a few words about safety.

23:11.973 --> 23:15.726
Axes, knives, lanterns, saws.
They can all be trouble.

23:15.811 --> 23:18.771
Their misuse is the main cause
of camp accidents.

23:18.855 --> 23:21.565
Take care of your equipment,
and it'll take care of you.

23:21.650 --> 23:25.778
Now, a word of caution
about our friends in the forest.

23:26.655 --> 23:28.948
Among other things,
this is bear country.

23:29.032 --> 23:32.410
And contrary to what everybody hears,
bears are dangerous.

23:32.494 --> 23:35.329
That means no food fights.

23:35.414 --> 23:38.290
Change often.
Food odours cling to clothing.

23:38.917 --> 23:41.752
If you're a woman, don't use perfume.

23:41.837 --> 23:44.713
And keep clean
during your menstrual cycle.

23:49.219 --> 23:52.179
Having trouble?
You gotta treat them gentle.

23:52.264 --> 23:53.639
Just like kids.

23:53.723 --> 23:57.351
Use a little of that child psychology
you're majoring in.

24:00.480 --> 24:01.689
Try it.

24:13.535 --> 24:16.328
It's more fun using
that child psychology on you.

24:16.413 --> 24:18.539
You're such a sucker for it.

24:22.210 --> 24:25.212
- Thanks much.
- I don't want to scare anyone,

24:26.798 --> 24:30.217
but I'm gonna give it
to you straight about Jason.

24:31.595 --> 24:35.389
His body was never recovered
from the lake after he drowned.

24:37.517 --> 24:40.811
If you listen to the old-timers,
they'll tell you he's still out there.

24:40.896 --> 24:46.150
Some sort of demented creature,
surviving in the wilderness.

24:46.234 --> 24:47.943
Full-grown by now.

24:49.070 --> 24:50.404
Stalking.

24:51.573 --> 24:55.868
Stealing what he needs,
living offwild animals and vegetation.

24:58.413 --> 25:02.166
Some folks claim they've even
seen him, right in this area.

25:04.377 --> 25:09.006
The girl who survived that night
at Camp Blood, that Friday the 13th,

25:10.759 --> 25:12.676
she claims she saw him.

25:14.471 --> 25:16.931
She disappeared two months later.

25:18.099 --> 25:19.433
Vanished.

25:21.102 --> 25:22.937
Blood was everywhere.

25:24.898 --> 25:27.358
No one knows what happened to her.

25:30.946 --> 25:34.740
Legend has it that Jason saw
his mother beheaded that night,

25:35.742 --> 25:37.743
and he took his revenge.

25:39.329 --> 25:43.958
A revenge that he'll continue to seek
if anyone enters his wilderness again.

25:48.463 --> 25:52.800
And by now, I guess you all know,
we're the first to return here.

25:56.429 --> 26:00.933
Five years.
Five long years, he's been dormant.

26:03.144 --> 26:04.770
And he's hungry.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.357
Jason's out there

26:10.318 --> 26:11.777
watching.

26:13.154 --> 26:15.656
Always on the prowl for intruders.

26:16.783 --> 26:18.409
Waiting to kill.

26:19.369 --> 26:21.078
Waiting to devour.

26:23.832 --> 26:25.833
Thirsty for young blood.

26:31.631 --> 26:33.757
Hey, come back! Come back!

26:39.180 --> 26:42.433
Okay, look, now that we've got that
out of our system,

26:42.517 --> 26:44.310
I don't want to hear any more about it.

26:44.394 --> 26:47.605
It's ancient history. Jason drowned,
Mrs Voorhees was killed,

26:47.689 --> 26:51.275
and Camp Crystal Lake is off-limits.
You got it?

26:51.359 --> 26:54.361
Got you, huh? What did you think?

26:55.864 --> 26:57.948
The second act needs work.

27:11.004 --> 27:12.713
- Too bad.
- Come on.

27:15.550 --> 27:18.886
You got him. You got him.
You got him now.

27:19.512 --> 27:20.721
Go on.

27:23.516 --> 27:27.895
- That's luck. That's luck, all right?
- Thanks a lot.

27:27.979 --> 27:29.104
Next.

27:31.232 --> 27:34.401
- Hi, Terry. Do you wanna dance?
- No, thank you.

27:34.486 --> 27:37.905
Hi there. How about you?
Do you wanna dance?

27:45.622 --> 27:51.335
So there I was, sitting in this
fast-food joint, thinking to myself,

27:51.419 --> 27:55.964
"Scott, old boy, what are you gonna do
with the rest of your life?"

28:05.266 --> 28:07.935
I'm striking out all over the place.

28:08.019 --> 28:10.479
Well, I think I've got you. Check.

28:12.315 --> 28:13.982
Wrong, white man.

28:15.318 --> 28:17.361
Checkmate.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.949
Well, what next?

28:22.033 --> 28:24.410
I could get my arm broken by Mark,

28:24.494 --> 28:27.746
my brains Ponged
by our electronical wizard

28:29.582 --> 28:30.958
or bed.

28:32.669 --> 28:35.462
Good night, Paul.
See you in the morning.

29:00.905 --> 29:02.865
Jeff, I just gotta see that place.

29:02.949 --> 29:06.243
- What place?
- That camp. Camp Blood.

29:06.327 --> 29:08.412
- You're crazy.
- I've just got to.

29:08.496 --> 29:11.540
Maybe there is something
to that legend. I'm serious.

29:11.624 --> 29:14.126
No way.
You're not getting me out there.

29:14.210 --> 29:17.463
- Besides, Paul said it was off-limits.
- We'll see.

30:14.854 --> 30:16.063
Hello?

30:19.234 --> 30:20.651
Who's there?

30:31.120 --> 30:34.998
- Paul, God damn it! What do you...
- Hey, hey, hey. Calm down.

30:35.083 --> 30:37.084
You'll wake the natives.

30:37.585 --> 30:40.921
I'm not supposed to be fraternizing
with the staff.

30:46.386 --> 30:47.886
I won't tell.

31:03.820 --> 31:05.612
I missed you, Ginny.

31:06.573 --> 31:10.033
And I really was worried
when you didn't show on time.

31:31.681 --> 31:35.309
Oh, Paul, there's something
I think I should tell you.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.275
Come on! Come on!

32:25.360 --> 32:27.778
What's the matter, guys?
Jeff, the women are showing you up.

32:27.862 --> 32:30.030
What's the matter with you?

32:31.783 --> 32:32.866
Hey!

32:50.802 --> 32:54.012
We've got about a half a mile,
then we're gonna have lunch.

32:54.097 --> 32:57.933
Try to stay on this trail, because
there's a lot of poison ivy along here.

32:58.017 --> 33:01.895
- How far are we from camp?
- Hey, you guys, don't trip on that.

33:04.565 --> 33:07.192
Mr Holt.
What are we gonna have for lunch?

33:07.276 --> 33:09.361
Ted's probably gonna cook.

33:12.156 --> 33:16.243
All right, after lunch,
we're gonna do some more running.

33:58.995 --> 34:01.496
- Here you go, Ted.
- Thank you, dear.

34:06.878 --> 34:09.379
- Come and get them!
- I'm here.

34:15.636 --> 34:19.556
Muffin? Here, girl. Muffin.

34:23.895 --> 34:25.145
Muffin?

34:25.980 --> 34:27.313
Terry, lunch!

34:27.398 --> 34:29.065
Okay. I'm coming!

35:00.765 --> 35:01.765
<i>- Jeff.</i>
- What?

35:01.849 --> 35:02.974
You ready?

35:03.059 --> 35:04.976
- For what?
- Camp Blood.

35:06.020 --> 35:07.771
I thought we weren't supposed
to go near that place.

35:07.855 --> 35:11.108
Come on, it's only a short walk.
They'll never know we're gone.

35:11.192 --> 35:13.944
Jeff, I'm serious. I really wanna see it.

35:14.028 --> 35:18.115
Look, when we get back to the city,
we can tell everyone we were there.

35:18.199 --> 35:20.450
Oh, come on, you chicken shit.

35:35.007 --> 35:36.550
Okay, let's go.

36:06.914 --> 36:09.583
Okay, you guys. I got one. Ready?

36:09.667 --> 36:13.003
What's green and red
and moves 100 miles an hour?

36:13.087 --> 36:15.589
- What?
- A frog in a blender.

36:15.673 --> 36:17.716
Ha-ha. That wasn't funny.

36:19.010 --> 36:22.053
- What's brown and sits on a piano?
- Your face.

36:22.138 --> 36:24.222
Beethoven's last movement.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.266
God.

37:04.138 --> 37:06.056
- This must be it.
- Yeah.

37:46.806 --> 37:49.057
- Oh, my God!
- What is it?

37:49.141 --> 37:50.934
It looks like a dog.

37:51.852 --> 37:55.272
- It's too mangled to tell.
- What do you think did it?

37:55.356 --> 37:57.190
Wild animal, I guess.

37:59.527 --> 38:01.945
What are you kids doing out here?

38:06.200 --> 38:10.787
You're gonna have to keep your people
away from that place. It's condemned.

38:11.330 --> 38:13.623
Next time I catch anybody there,
I'll run them in.

38:13.708 --> 38:16.376
- He told us...
- I'll handle this, Jeff.

38:18.212 --> 38:21.589
- I might just get a warrant against you.
- Oh, really?

38:25.052 --> 38:29.973
Look, Holt, people say what you're doing
with these kids is great.

38:30.057 --> 38:32.600
You've got a good reputation.

38:32.685 --> 38:35.645
But if I was you,
I'd have located in the next county.

38:35.730 --> 38:37.647
You're too close.

38:37.732 --> 38:40.692
Things have been quiet for five years.
That's the way we want it.

38:40.776 --> 38:43.194
So do I, Officer. So do I.

38:44.280 --> 38:46.948
Okay, you two, take off,
and I'll talk to you at dinner.

38:47.033 --> 38:50.285
- We'll never do it again, sir.
- Thanks, Mr Holt.

38:52.997 --> 38:55.498
You're not even gonna reprimand them?

38:55.583 --> 38:58.626
No punishment?
What kind of place is this?

38:58.711 --> 39:00.337
- Ginny?
- Yes, Paul?

39:00.421 --> 39:03.631
No seconds on dessert
for Jeff and Sandra tonight.

39:08.429 --> 39:09.721
You okay?

39:11.849 --> 39:14.559
Should we tell Terry?
You know, about what we saw?

39:14.643 --> 39:18.146
No way. As far as I'm concerned,
we didn't see a thing.

39:43.881 --> 39:46.216
Hey! Hey, you!

42:38.222 --> 42:41.140
Oh, my God.

42:46.730 --> 42:49.023
- Oh, no.
- Anybody want...

42:49.108 --> 42:50.858
Who made this shit?

42:52.486 --> 42:54.904
Okay, people.

42:54.989 --> 42:57.323
Today was fun and games, right?

42:57.408 --> 42:59.576
I like to start you out slow, ease you in.

42:59.660 --> 43:02.161
Tomorrow, we'll get serious.

43:02.246 --> 43:06.583
Anybody who wants a last night
on the town, now's your chance.

43:06.667 --> 43:09.419
Okay, who else?
We only have two cars.

43:09.503 --> 43:11.671
By the way, our wanderers
have volunteered to stay

43:11.755 --> 43:15.133
and watch the camp.
Isn't that nice of them?

43:15.217 --> 43:17.635
I think I'll stay too. Muffin may show.

43:17.720 --> 43:20.722
Well, I'm gonna go change, you guys.

43:20.806 --> 43:24.475
You know, I'm pretty tired.
I think I'll stick around too.

43:25.686 --> 43:26.644
- Get me another cup of coffee?
- Sure.

43:26.729 --> 43:29.397
- Don't drink too much.
- Bye-bye.

43:31.025 --> 43:32.442
Hey, you staying?

43:32.526 --> 43:36.195
Yeah. Nothing spoils a party faster
than a drunk in a wheelchair.

43:36.280 --> 43:39.532
That's crap.
Look, we can go together if you want.

43:39.617 --> 43:43.119
I appreciate that, but I'm in training.

43:43.203 --> 43:45.872
- Then I'm staying too.
- Suit yourself.

43:47.875 --> 43:50.335
So how about it, second-in-command?
You coming?

43:50.419 --> 43:51.586
- You buying?
- Sure.

43:51.670 --> 43:54.922
- You got a deal.
- Got the keys?

43:58.344 --> 43:59.719
Beer time!

44:00.638 --> 44:04.140
Take it easy. Have fun.
I'll have a Jack for you.

44:04.224 --> 44:08.102
- See you later!
- Bring back my truck in one piece.

44:08.187 --> 44:11.773
- I'm going for a walk.
- We'll wait up for you, all right?

44:20.115 --> 44:21.574
Go, scooter.

44:45.099 --> 44:47.183
Now I know how you can afford
tuition to grad school.

44:47.267 --> 44:51.104
You always find some fool
to fix your car and buy you a beer.

44:52.106 --> 44:53.481
You got it.

45:25.556 --> 45:26.806
Muffin?

45:32.354 --> 45:34.355
- Here we are!
- All right.

45:44.116 --> 45:47.201
Everybody, get out for some beers!
All right!

46:42.007 --> 46:43.549
Come on, Mark.

46:44.343 --> 46:45.593
Come on.

46:50.015 --> 46:52.391
You're gonna lose. All right!

46:52.976 --> 46:54.352
- Hey!
- Cheater.

46:54.436 --> 46:57.563
- Okay, okay, okay. Two out of three.
- All right.

46:59.274 --> 47:02.777
Jeff, don't wear yourself out.

47:02.861 --> 47:05.238
You wanna wrestle, come with me.

47:06.865 --> 47:09.075
Later, scooter.

47:09.159 --> 47:10.993
Wanna take me on?

47:11.078 --> 47:12.787
Sure. Have a seat.

47:18.669 --> 47:21.170
- I only want your fingers.
- What?

47:22.881 --> 47:24.841
Take your pick.

47:24.925 --> 47:27.385
They're Ted's. It's okay with him.

47:28.095 --> 47:30.346
Football and hockey.

47:30.430 --> 47:33.599
- Which one do you prefer?
- The one with the puck.

47:34.893 --> 47:37.812
- You mean hockey?
- Is that what you call it?

47:38.522 --> 47:40.940
Okay. What do you wanna play for?

47:42.192 --> 47:43.484
Position.

48:31.992 --> 48:33.910
Looking for something?

48:46.173 --> 48:49.383
- Come and get it.
- Give me my shirt, Scott.

48:52.721 --> 48:55.056
If I get my hands on you...

48:55.140 --> 48:56.349
Scott!

48:59.686 --> 49:01.854
It's no longer funny, Scott.

49:03.857 --> 49:07.568
Help! God damn that Paul!
Him and his wilderness bullshit!

49:08.278 --> 49:11.113
- What can I do?
- Get me down, that's what!

49:11.198 --> 49:15.034
- I'll have to get a knife to cut the rope.
- Well, hurry, okay?

49:19.414 --> 49:21.457
I ought to let you hang, you pervert.

49:21.541 --> 49:23.834
Come on, Ter. Give me a break.

49:24.670 --> 49:28.005
- You gonna cut the crap?
- Sure, anything. I promise.

49:28.590 --> 49:29.715
Okay.

49:32.094 --> 49:33.803
Don't go anywhere.

49:36.640 --> 49:38.057
Very funny.

50:30.360 --> 50:31.861
Where is she?

51:08.607 --> 51:10.733
Scott, I'm gonna cut you down.

51:10.817 --> 51:14.820
But I swear, if you ever do this to me
again, I'm gonna kill you.

51:16.239 --> 51:17.448
Scott?

52:05.372 --> 52:06.872
Look at this.

52:07.624 --> 52:09.416
I think I'm in love.

52:09.501 --> 52:12.169
No, no, it's just tremendous affection.

52:14.506 --> 52:17.591
Are you sure you don't
want me to clear those?

52:17.676 --> 52:20.302
- No, I'm collecting these.
- Have it your way, honey.

52:20.387 --> 52:23.097
I just don't want the bar
to fall down on you.

52:23.181 --> 52:24.390
Thanks.

52:25.433 --> 52:28.185
- I think she likes you.
- I think so too.

52:30.272 --> 52:32.356
This whole thing's ridiculous, really.

52:32.440 --> 52:36.152
Two of our kids got hauled in today,
because five years ago

52:36.236 --> 52:40.698
some girl panics and falls out
of a canoe. It's absurd.

52:41.992 --> 52:45.452
- What if there is a Jason?
- Oh, bullshit, Ginny.

52:45.537 --> 52:47.371
No, what if there is
some kind of boy-beast

52:47.455 --> 52:49.582
running around Camp Crystal Lake?

52:49.666 --> 52:53.294
Let's try to think beyond the legend.
Put it in real terms.

52:53.378 --> 52:55.421
I mean, what would he be like today?

52:55.505 --> 52:58.549
Some kind of
out-of-control psychopath?

52:58.633 --> 53:02.970
A frightened retard?
A child trapped in a man's body?

53:03.054 --> 53:04.430
Let me out!

53:07.434 --> 53:09.977
- He'd be grown by now, right?
- Right.

53:10.937 --> 53:14.398
And, you know, the only person
that ever knew him was his mother.

53:14.482 --> 53:18.027
He never went to school,
so he never had any friends.

53:18.111 --> 53:19.820
She was everything to him.

53:19.905 --> 53:22.114
Yeah. Deranged killer.

53:24.534 --> 53:27.745
No, no, no.
You're missing my whole point.

53:27.829 --> 53:31.123
I mean, I doubt Jason would have
even known the meaning of death.

53:31.208 --> 53:33.584
Or at least until that horrible night.

53:33.668 --> 53:36.462
He must have seen
the whole thing happen.

53:37.214 --> 53:41.383
He must have seen his mother killed,
and all just because she loved him.

53:41.468 --> 53:43.677
Isn't that what her revenge
was all about?

53:43.762 --> 53:48.390
Her sense of loss, her rage
at what she thought happened,

53:48.475 --> 53:50.142
her love for him?

53:54.147 --> 53:55.856
Bizarre, isn't it?

53:58.276 --> 54:03.030
He must be out there right now,
crying for her return, her resurrection.

54:05.992 --> 54:09.078
- Well, what do you think?
- I think you're drunk.

54:09.162 --> 54:12.248
I'll drink to that.
Hit us again, sweetheart.

54:12.332 --> 54:13.540
Not me.

54:18.463 --> 54:22.049
You know, Paul,
I'm really serious about this though.

54:22.133 --> 54:25.594
Jason's a legend, Ginny, a legend.

55:15.145 --> 55:18.522
Your turn.
Three goals or you're gonna lose.

55:18.606 --> 55:20.733
I've heard that one before.

55:22.235 --> 55:25.696
Mark, what happened
that you have to be in a chair?

55:26.990 --> 55:30.075
Motorcycle accident, paralysed my legs.

55:30.160 --> 55:31.785
Is it permanent?

55:32.746 --> 55:35.164
The doctor thinks so. I don't.

55:36.291 --> 55:40.085
I don't intend to be in this thing
the rest of my life.

55:40.170 --> 55:43.130
Just your legs, huh?
Is everything else okay?

55:45.342 --> 55:48.218
Oh, I do all right, one way or another.

55:52.891 --> 55:54.433
Toke?

55:54.517 --> 55:56.602
I'm in training, remember?

55:57.395 --> 55:58.687
For what?

56:46.486 --> 56:48.487
What does the winner get?

56:49.322 --> 56:51.824
- What does the winner want?
- Guess.

57:00.166 --> 57:02.126
Want to stay together tonight?

57:02.210 --> 57:04.253
I was just about to ask you.

57:04.337 --> 57:06.004
My cabin or yours?

57:07.257 --> 57:10.801
Ted's in mine.
I don't think that would work out.

57:10.885 --> 57:13.595
We've got the whole camp.
We'll find our own cabin.

57:13.680 --> 57:16.515
Just give me a few minutes
to get some things, okay?

57:16.599 --> 57:18.809
- Sure.
- I'll be right back.

57:30.196 --> 57:31.655
Oh, damn it.

57:35.952 --> 57:37.661
Terry, you turkey.

59:47.500 --> 59:49.001
There you are.

01:00:11.232 --> 01:00:12.441
Vickie?

01:00:18.948 --> 01:00:20.741
Vickie, is that you?

01:00:44.432 --> 01:00:45.682
Vickie?

01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:51.391
I looked up "ugly" in the dictionary.

01:02:51.476 --> 01:02:53.518
There's a picture of him.

01:02:55.062 --> 01:02:57.606
- I got to get some sleep.
- I'm tired.

01:02:57.690 --> 01:03:01.276
- You guys quitting already?
- Ted, you'd have me out till breakfast.

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.195
- I'm gonna ride with you, okay?
- Okay.

01:03:03.279 --> 01:03:06.072
- Good night, Ted.
- Good night, Ginny.

01:03:06.157 --> 01:03:08.742
When this place closes,
come straight back to camp.

01:03:08.826 --> 01:03:11.119
- Yes, boss.
- And let Maggie drive the pickup.

01:03:11.204 --> 01:03:12.537
Yes, boss.

01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:18.043
Okay, let's make a run for it.

01:03:19.212 --> 01:03:21.838
- Move it!
- I'm going! I'm going!

01:03:31.891 --> 01:03:33.642
This thing had better start.

01:03:33.726 --> 01:03:36.853
- You fixed it.
- I know, that's what worries me.

01:03:47.824 --> 01:03:49.574
Are there any
after-hours places around here?

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:51.576
- Sure are.
- "Sure are."

01:04:02.129 --> 01:04:12.389
Mark?

01:04:17.103 --> 01:04:18.937
Mark, where are you?

01:04:30.741 --> 01:04:32.617
Is anybody still here?

01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:39.165
Sandra?

01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:40.375
<i>Jeff?</i>

01:04:42.795 --> 01:04:44.963
Sandra? Jeff?

01:04:52.305 --> 01:04:53.555
Sandra.

01:04:57.476 --> 01:04:58.685
Sandra?

01:05:02.815 --> 01:05:04.024
Sandra.

01:05:07.153 --> 01:05:08.778
No! No!

01:05:12.366 --> 01:05:13.450
No!

01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:18.204
No! Stop!

01:05:20.333 --> 01:05:22.667
No! No!

01:06:03.584 --> 01:06:05.210
Nice night.

01:06:05.294 --> 01:06:06.962
Yeah, for a duck.

01:06:24.397 --> 01:06:25.438
God.

01:06:27.441 --> 01:06:29.818
What the hell are all the lights on for?

01:06:29.902 --> 01:06:33.154
Paul, they wouldn't have
left the place like this.

01:06:36.784 --> 01:06:38.785
Think something's wrong?

01:06:40.913 --> 01:06:42.706
I'll check upstairs.

01:06:46.919 --> 01:06:49.921
These kids smoke better dope
than I do.

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:51.131
Paul!

01:06:53.801 --> 01:06:55.635
Yeah, Ginny, what...

01:06:58.597 --> 01:07:00.181
What is this, a joke?

01:07:00.266 --> 01:07:02.809
They wouldn't do anything like this.

01:07:07.356 --> 01:07:08.940
Ginny, come on.

01:07:09.859 --> 01:07:11.276
Wait for me.

01:07:15.948 --> 01:07:19.868
Kitchen light's still on. Must...
Must be the main fuse again.

01:07:19.952 --> 01:07:22.620
- Paul, what's going on here?
- Nothing.

01:07:27.668 --> 01:07:29.377
Where is everybody?

01:07:29.462 --> 01:07:30.962
I don't know.

01:07:32.798 --> 01:07:35.717
The rain's stopping.
We'll go look for them.

01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:53.693
Paul, there's someone in this room.

01:07:57.490 --> 01:08:00.325
Paul, there's someone
in this fucking room!

01:08:05.122 --> 01:08:07.707
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:08:07.792 --> 01:08:16.341
Paul? Paul?

01:08:22.264 --> 01:08:25.850
Paul?

01:08:26.227 --> 01:08:27.602
Answer me!

01:10:27.556 --> 01:10:30.516
God, please, keys, be there.
Keys, be there...

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:36.648
Come on, car! Come on, car!

01:10:37.149 --> 01:10:39.817
Please start. Please start. Please start.

01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:41.110
Start!

01:10:41.612 --> 01:10:42.904
Oh, shit!

01:10:58.003 --> 01:16:30.960
Oh, my God!

01:16:31.044 --> 01:16:32.628
Please help me.

01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:39.844
Oh, God...

01:17:51.958 --> 01:17:54.669
Jason! It's all done, Jason.

01:17:56.755 --> 01:18:00.132
You've done your job well,
and Mommy is pleased.

01:18:00.217 --> 01:18:01.926
That's a good boy.

01:18:03.553 --> 01:18:06.514
Now, come to Mommy. Come on.

01:18:09.935 --> 01:18:11.185
Come on.

01:18:13.939 --> 01:18:16.607
Mommy has a reward for you.

01:18:26.118 --> 01:18:33.874
Jason, Mother is talking to you.

01:18:36.378 --> 01:18:39.964
Come on.

01:18:41.466 --> 01:18:42.842
That's my boy.

01:18:42.926 --> 01:18:45.928
Come. Kneel down.

01:18:48.014 --> 01:18:49.473
That's a boy.

01:18:51.601 --> 01:18:52.977
Kneel down.

01:18:54.146 --> 01:18:55.813
Kneel down, Jason.

01:18:57.649 --> 01:18:59.817
That's my good boy.

01:19:05.198 --> 01:19:07.199
That's a good boy.

01:19:08.076 --> 01:19:10.202
Good Jason.

01:19:24.634 --> 01:19:25.843
Ginny!

01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:40.543
Come on. Let's go.

01:20:41.753 --> 01:20:42.920
Ginny.

01:20:54.432 --> 01:20:55.599
Jesus.

01:20:57.435 --> 01:20:58.686
Come on.

01:21:25.964 --> 01:21:27.131
Paul!

01:21:27.966 --> 01:21:30.217
Come on. I'll carry you.

01:22:02.125 --> 01:22:03.667
It's all right.

01:22:09.174 --> 01:22:12.259
Hey, you're all right. You're all...

01:22:16.514 --> 01:22:18.432
God! Oh, God!

01:22:18.516 --> 01:22:22.186
No, you're okay. You're okay.

01:22:22.270 --> 01:22:24.855
You're okay, Ginny. You're all right.

01:22:26.358 --> 01:22:27.942
It's all right.

01:23:29.295 --> 01:23:31.046
Oh, Muffin!

01:23:33.758 --> 01:23:34.967
Muffin.

01:23:42.934 --> 01:23:44.351
Oh, Muffin.

01:23:48.231 --> 01:23:49.940
Come here, Muffin.

01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:26.935
Paul? Paul?

01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:28.479
Where's Paul?
