- Should I go?

02:05.333 --> 02:07.583
Okay.

02:12.125 --> 02:14.625
Hi.

02:14.708 --> 02:17.791
I'm the actor of the group,
so...

02:17.875 --> 02:19.541
I'm going first.

02:19.625 --> 02:23.458
I've been, um, preparing this
speech for the past few days

02:23.541 --> 02:26.375
and I have been asking myself,

02:26.458 --> 02:27.666
you know, "Who was Dory?

02:27.750 --> 02:28.708
"Who was she?

02:28.791 --> 02:31.083
Like, who was Dory," right?

02:31.166 --> 02:32.208
And it's a question that

02:32.291 --> 02:33.416
I've been asking myself a lot,

02:33.500 --> 02:36.125
kind of almost obsessively,

02:36.208 --> 02:38.208
since I was cast as her in an

02:38.291 --> 02:40.875
upcoming film about our lives.

02:40.958 --> 02:43.041
Um, it's kind of embarrassing
for me to admit,

02:43.125 --> 02:45.875
but I actually was, like,
recast,

02:45.958 --> 02:48.250
which has never happened to me
professionally,

02:48.333 --> 02:51.083
because, um...

02:51.166 --> 02:53.833
[sighs]
I couldn't figure her out.

02:53.916 --> 02:56.083
And that was
very confusing for me

02:56.166 --> 02:57.875
because she's my best friend.

02:57.958 --> 03:02.083
And sometimes I honestly felt
like I didn't know her at all.

03:02.166 --> 03:06.000
And towards the end, I...

03:06.083 --> 03:09.875
got the impression she felt
the same way about herself.

03:09.958 --> 03:12.750
And...

03:12.833 --> 03:16.291
maybe we all feel
a little that way

03:16.375 --> 03:19.416
and we're kinda scared
to admit it.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.166
As an actor, I'm always
trying to understand

03:22.250 --> 03:23.916
my character's motivation.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.791
But I've learned I don't really
think people work that way.

03:26.875 --> 03:30.625
I think, like, we don't really
know what motivates us.

03:30.708 --> 03:33.625
We just kind of, like,
are the way we are.

03:33.708 --> 03:35.500
We don't really know
why the way we are

03:35.583 --> 03:37.458
the way that we are,
but we are the way that we are,

03:37.541 --> 03:39.166
and that's the way that we are.

03:39.250 --> 03:43.875
And the thing about Dory...

03:43.958 --> 03:45.791
is that I underestimated her.

03:45.875 --> 03:49.666
And I think a lot of people
underestimated her.

03:49.750 --> 03:51.500
And she had, like,
this secret power

03:51.583 --> 03:55.166
that I've never seen in anyone
ever in my life before,

03:55.250 --> 03:58.458
and I can't help but feel like
she had more years in her

03:58.541 --> 04:00.916
to figure out that power
and understand it,

04:01.000 --> 04:04.875
and I'm just really sad that
I will miss out on that.

04:04.958 --> 04:06.791
[sobbing]

04:06.875 --> 04:10.416
I'm sorry.
It's just...

04:12.291 --> 04:15.208
Dor was my best friend, and...

04:15.291 --> 04:18.666
maybe I didn't
understand her.

04:18.750 --> 04:22.000
But I really loved her.

04:24.625 --> 04:26.583
Are you gonna clap?

04:36.250 --> 04:39.666
- [clears throat]
Okay, so, um...

04:39.750 --> 04:43.500
If Dory were here,
she'd want me to be real.

04:43.583 --> 04:45.208
She'd want me
to tell the truth.

04:45.291 --> 04:46.750
[chuckles]

04:46.833 --> 04:49.125
So in that spirit...

04:49.208 --> 04:52.291
We all know
Dory was not perfect.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.541
She was a procrastinator.

04:54.625 --> 04:58.958
She was controlling.
She was pushy.

04:59.041 --> 05:01.375
She was perhaps insane.

05:01.458 --> 05:03.708
Sometimes she would go three
days without showering,

05:03.791 --> 05:06.208
we'd be like, "Dory,
please take a shower, please."

05:06.291 --> 05:09.333
She was--well, I'm not gonna
say she was stupid,

05:09.416 --> 05:12.583
but she did make
stupid decisions.

05:12.666 --> 05:14.791
And of course, she was
a lying,

05:14.875 --> 05:17.666
manipulative bitch.

05:17.750 --> 05:19.166
- Whoa.
- El!

05:19.250 --> 05:21.083
- And I know, I know you
all wanna boo me offstage,

05:21.166 --> 05:22.916
which I'm fine with,
by the way, okay?

05:23.000 --> 05:25.041
It's happened at every
college campus I go to.

05:25.125 --> 05:28.333
But I just wanna
ask you a question.

05:28.416 --> 05:31.208
Aren't you
all of those things too?

05:31.291 --> 05:32.458
I am.

05:32.541 --> 05:33.750
Except I do shower.

05:33.833 --> 05:36.208
But that's 'cause
I smell like shit.

05:36.291 --> 05:40.583
We all smell like shit.
Sir.

05:40.666 --> 05:43.250
I want us all to indulge me
for a second.

05:43.333 --> 05:44.958
Everyone turn to the person
next to you.

05:45.041 --> 05:47.000
And I want you to look
that person in the eye,

05:47.083 --> 05:49.041
and I want you to
say to that person

05:49.125 --> 05:52.958
the worst thing you could
possibly tell that person.

05:53.041 --> 05:54.916
Even if you don't know them.
Go ahead.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.416
- Elliott.

05:56.500 --> 05:57.916
- Seriously, guys.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.291

right now, you know?

06:00.375 --> 06:02.000
If not now, when, right?

06:02.083 --> 06:04.166
Just do it.
Do it now.

- I slept with the movers.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.541
- You look like you have
a thin penis.

06:09.625 --> 06:13.500
- Okay, now I want you to
think about what you just said.

06:13.583 --> 06:16.083
And now I want you to say
out loud,

06:16.166 --> 06:18.291
"I'm that, too".
Go on.

06:18.375 --> 06:20.458
all: I'm that too.

06:20.541 --> 06:21.708
- That too?

06:21.791 --> 06:23.791
- You feel that?
Yeah.

06:23.875 --> 06:26.541
The things you don't like
in other people

06:26.625 --> 06:30.958
are the things
you don't like in yourself.

06:31.041 --> 06:33.625
We are all unlikeable!

06:33.708 --> 06:35.583
Every one of us!

06:35.666 --> 06:37.208
And Dory was no exception.

06:37.291 --> 06:40.125
Okay, in fact, she was
exceptional at being unlikable.

06:40.208 --> 06:41.666
[chuckles]

06:42.833 --> 06:45.958
If you have complicated
feelings still in you

06:46.041 --> 06:47.500
about your love for Dory,

06:47.583 --> 06:51.291
just remember that there is
a dark side in all of us.

06:51.375 --> 06:55.458
But that darkness is
connected to the light, people.

06:55.541 --> 06:57.291
Maybe she was controlling.

06:57.375 --> 07:00.333
But that's just another way of
saying that she was passionate.

07:00.416 --> 07:01.833
Maybe she was pushy.

07:01.916 --> 07:04.291
I see that as her
being strong-willed.

07:04.375 --> 07:05.625
Yeah, she was violent.

07:05.708 --> 07:07.833
Or maybe that was her
being protective.

07:07.916 --> 07:09.666
Yeah, she was crazy.

07:09.750 --> 07:13.333
Or was she was
an out-of-the-box survivor.

07:13.416 --> 07:14.958
My point is,

07:15.041 --> 07:19.166
we have to stop
shaming darkness.

07:19.250 --> 07:21.041
Because when we do so,

07:21.125 --> 07:24.583
we stop understanding
human nature.

07:24.666 --> 07:28.250
This country was built
on darkness and deceit,

07:28.333 --> 07:31.083
and it grows stronger
with every day.

07:31.166 --> 07:33.166
We cannot ignore the past,

07:33.250 --> 07:38.375
but we can change the future,
y'all.

07:38.458 --> 07:42.416
And that requires
owning all of ourselves.

07:42.500 --> 07:44.708
May we all stand wisely

07:44.791 --> 07:48.458
in our own darkness
without fear or hate.

07:48.541 --> 07:52.458
May we seek to understand
the darkness in others,

07:52.541 --> 07:53.791
for it is there,

07:53.875 --> 07:55.458
and it ain't going nowhere,
honey.

07:55.541 --> 07:57.500

done with her life...

22:14.416 --> 22:16.375

22:17.416 --> 22:19.000

- Yeah, what would Dory's,

22:32.000 --> 22:33.458

22:33.541 --> 22:36.250

for a conference I had,

22:36.333 --> 22:38.500

22:38.583 --> 22:41.083
So I could see her
being happy there.

22:41.166 --> 22:45.458

two years she moves to Seattle.

22:45.541 --> 22:46.916
And then what's her job?

22:47.000 --> 22:48.500
- Well, visual art,
like her degree.

22:48.583 --> 22:51.833

22:53.375 --> 22:54.458

- Like, our apartment

22:54.541 --> 22:55.875

22:55.958 --> 22:57.625

she'd be really good at?

22:57.708 --> 22:59.250

- Designing restaurants.
