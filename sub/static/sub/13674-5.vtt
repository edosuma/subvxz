WEBVTT

00:10.136 --> 00:14.220
And Dinerral was more

00:14.348 --> 00:16.760
than just a big brother to me.

00:17.476 --> 00:20.263
He was the only father figure

00:20.396 --> 00:22.853
I've ever known.

00:23.858 --> 00:26.315
He was always there for me.

00:27.862 --> 00:30.774
He was always the highlight of my life.

00:33.201 --> 00:36.534
I can remember
my high—school graduation

00:37.872 --> 00:40.830
when he lied and told me
that he couldn't make it.

00:42.585 --> 00:45.122
l was so upset with him,

00:45.630 --> 00:47.495
to walk outside

00:48.174 --> 00:50.631
and to find him

00:50.760 --> 00:54.378
and the rest of my Hot 8 brothers
standing in the corner

00:55.097 --> 00:57.759
ready to strike a beat for me.

00:57.892 --> 01:00.224
And he played.

01:00.353 --> 01:02.264
And he gave me and my class

01:02.396 --> 01:05.888
the best graduation second line ever.

01:08.444 --> 01:10.435
He was all I had.

01:12.907 --> 01:15.068
(Sobbing)

01:15.201 --> 01:19.570
Who's gonna be there for me now?

01:20.581 --> 01:23.493
— (Man) Take your time, baby.
— (Sobbing)

01:23.626 --> 01:25.617
(Man) Touch her, Lord.

01:26.712 --> 01:29.419
(Nakita sobbing) Oh God.

01:37.098 --> 01:40.340
Those family members
who wish to take their parting,

01:40.476 --> 01:44.185
- you may do so.
— (Organ playing)

01:44.313 --> 01:46.520
(Man) It's gonna be all right.

01:58.244 --> 02:00.326
- Bennie.
— Hey Antoine.

02:00.454 --> 02:04.242
— I don't know what to say, brah.
- Nothing to say, man.

02:14.844 --> 02:17.506
(J‘ Playing What A Friend We Have In Jesus)

04:06.455 --> 04:07.991
(Woman) All right.

06:13.457 --> 06:15.448
(Woman) And the nature
of Mr. Weyman's passing is,

06:15.584 --> 06:17.324
I know, disturbing to all of us,

06:17.461 --> 06:19.747
particularly with what
many of us have been dealing with

06:19.880 --> 06:21.666
since Hurricane Katrina.

06:22.132 --> 06:25.260
If any of you find yourself
harboring any harmful thoughts

06:25.386 --> 06:29.129
or feel yourselves to be depressed
or feel any anxiety at all,

06:29.265 --> 06:33.133
I want you to bring those feelings
to Dr. Stecklow and her counseling team

06:33.269 --> 06:35.305
or to your regular school counselors

06:35.437 --> 06:38.144
or to any teacher
with whom you feel comfortable.

06:38.274 --> 06:41.641
Students should now proceed
to your regular third—period classes.

06:41.777 --> 06:43.984
(Students chattering)

06:46.323 --> 06:48.314
(Boy) I heard that his wife left him.

06:48.450 --> 06:50.486
(Boy #2) He took pills.
Do you know what he took?

06:50.619 --> 06:52.701
(Boy #1) No, he shot himself.

07:01.130 --> 07:04.418
Sofia, this is especially
hard for you, I know.

07:04.550 --> 07:07.417
— Um...
— If you need to talk, I'm here.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.566
(School bell rings)

07:34.788 --> 07:36.494
It was them niggas
from Robertson and Touro.

07:36.624 --> 07:39.832
They were beefing with his brothers
and seen him come through,

07:39.960 --> 07:41.666
lit his ass up.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.457
- I heard he threw shots first.
— Tristan ain't had no gun, man.

07:44.590 --> 07:46.296
- I seen it.
— You saw his gun?

07:46.425 --> 07:49.007
(Batiste) OK, OK, listen up now.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.297
Listen up.

07:51.430 --> 07:54.046
— Where's Mr. Lecoeur?
— Went down to the office.

07:54.183 --> 07:57.141
He gonna bust some heads,
find out why the instruments ain't coming.

07:57.269 --> 07:59.601
All right, well,
why don't y'all take y'all places?

07:59.730 --> 08:02.142
- All right?
— We ain't supposed to be doing nothing.

08:02.274 --> 08:04.481
— Yes, you are. Take your place. Sit down.
— Nah.

08:04.610 --> 08:06.692
l'm—a deal with you later.
Sit down.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.526
All right, listen.

08:08.656 --> 08:13.741
It's time for a little music appreciation.
Y'all listen much to Louis Armst...

08:13.869 --> 08:16.076
(Class) Ooh!

08:18.832 --> 08:20.743
Y'all listen much to Louis Armstrong?

08:20.876 --> 08:22.958
Mr. Lecoeur said we ain't gonna
do nothing today 'cause of Tristan.

08:23.087 --> 08:25.373
— What happened to Tristan?
— He got shot.

08:26.507 --> 08:28.418
- He got shot?
— He's in the hospital.

08:28.550 --> 08:31.462
Tristan was second snare drummer,
and me — l was third.

08:31.595 --> 08:33.381
So I'm second now, right?

08:33.514 --> 08:35.425
Fool, you ain't even got no instrument.

08:35.557 --> 08:39.721
I'm just saying when | get me one.
Mr. Batiste, I am second now, right?

08:40.896 --> 08:42.887
Go take y'all seats.

08:44.525 --> 08:46.811
Accused of murder
and attempted murder

08:46.944 --> 08:49.777
on the Danziger Bridge
in the days after Katrina,

08:49.905 --> 08:54.444
one by one, seven NOPD officers
turn themselves in to police.

08:54.952 --> 08:56.863
(Reporter) Loved ones say their goodbyes,

08:56.995 --> 08:59.657
as the so—called Danziger 7
turn themselves in

08:59.790 --> 09:01.655
at Orleans Parish Central Lockup.

09:01.792 --> 09:04.374
(Men on TV chanting) NOPD! NOPD!

09:04.878 --> 09:06.288
(Reporter) Seven New Orleans
police officers...

09:06.422 --> 09:08.162
Damn, they indicted all seven.

09:08.298 --> 09:10.004
lf Eddie can convict any of them,

09:10.134 --> 09:12.045
you're gonna follow
with one hell of a civil case.

09:12.177 --> 09:16.762
Yeah, my Danziger file
suddenly has all kind of potential.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.426
This one not so much.

09:18.559 --> 09:19.719
— Abreu?
— Yeah.

09:19.852 --> 09:22.013
Guess I'll call the guy,
tell him what I learned,

09:22.146 --> 09:24.387
give him the number
for the Loyola law clinic.

09:24.523 --> 09:26.434
— Or he can call an investigator.
- Yeah.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.979
But you have enough on your plate.

09:29.987 --> 09:32.228
You're right. I know.

09:32.364 --> 09:34.571
(J‘ Jazz on radio)

09:40.914 --> 09:42.654
(Knock on door)

09:42.791 --> 09:45.373
— Can I help you?
— Safety and permit inspector.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.911
— I didn't call for no inspections.
— No, I'm just canvassing,

09:49.047 --> 09:50.912
looking to see where folks are back

09:51.049 --> 09:53.540
and that everything is
right with the paper.

09:54.511 --> 09:57.844
— That's a new installation, isn't it?
- It all works fine.

09:57.973 --> 10:00.680
Yeah, that's good to hear,
but I didn't see any permit posted.

10:00.809 --> 10:02.674
Don't need no permit.

10:02.811 --> 10:05.553
My pipes work just fine.

10:08.650 --> 10:11.027
— and they turned me back on.
- But this is new work -

10:11.153 --> 10:14.737
new pipes, new commode.
Until you get a state—licensed plumber

10:14.865 --> 10:17.447
to sign off on this work
and get the proper permits,

10:17.576 --> 10:19.908
I'm gonna have to
shut the water off at the street.

10:20.037 --> 10:22.528
I'm out here living hand—to—mouth,
day to day.

10:22.664 --> 10:25.121
Now you're gonna make me pay again

10:25.250 --> 10:27.627
for work I've already done?

10:27.753 --> 10:31.496
- I don't make the ordinances, sir.
— The whole fucking city goes undenNater

10:31.632 --> 10:34.544
and y'all carry on like
it's business as usual.

10:34.676 --> 10:37.133
Now I'm out here on my own
getting shit done.

10:37.262 --> 10:39.218
Don't that count for nothing
with you people?

10:39.348 --> 10:41.339
Sorry, sir.

10:46.063 --> 10:47.178
(Man) Roasted capon...

10:47.314 --> 10:49.896
— Thank you.
— He'll be with you in a moment.

10:50.025 --> 10:51.936
(Man) ...the thigh is stuffed with the truffle.

10:52.069 --> 10:54.560
— The amuse tonight is Spanish mackerel...
— (Whispering)

10:54.696 --> 10:57.108
...with clementine puree,
pickled cranberry and lemon pepper.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.579
— Chef.
— Chef, thank you so much for seeing me.

11:06.708 --> 11:09.950
| just felt the need to apologize to you
and say I'm sorry.

11:10.087 --> 11:12.578
You made things happen for me here
and I fucked it up.

11:12.714 --> 11:15.842
l embarrassed you.
You gave me an amazing break

11:18.345 --> 11:20.427
And ljust... Well, | behaved like a maniac.

11:20.556 --> 11:22.592
There's no excuse.

11:23.058 --> 11:25.390
Did you throw the drink
and the glass or just the drink?

11:25.519 --> 11:27.680
Oh God, no. Just the drink.

11:27.813 --> 11:30.600
—Ammdmﬂ
— Pretty much.

11:31.149 --> 11:33.811
Sazerac — nice touch.

11:34.945 --> 11:36.856
Well, it seemed appropriate.

11:36.989 --> 11:39.526
Listen, | read the article.
Everybody read the article.

11:39.658 --> 11:42.650
— The guy was totally out of line.
— Well, no excuse though, no excuse.

11:42.786 --> 11:45.869
— Listen, go talk to Eric.
- Ripert? Eric Ripert?

11:45.998 --> 11:48.580
Yeah, you know, he's a Buddhist.
He's all into forgiveness.

11:48.709 --> 11:50.495
— He'll take care of you.
- Are you serious?

11:50.627 --> 11:53.494
Yeah. And whatever you do, stop throwing
drinks in people's faces, will you?

11:53.630 --> 11:54.881
- Of course.
— All right, I gotta run.

11:55.007 --> 11:57.965
— I'll see you. Take care.
— Thank you so much, Chef.

12:17.779 --> 12:20.646
Oh, we gotta keep Ballzack on
the track list, let the West Bank represent.

12:21.909 --> 12:23.900
Maybe a draw for the college crowd.

12:25.037 --> 12:28.700
I don't know.
But Miz Tee, Katey, Big Freedia —

12:28.832 --> 12:31.869
it's a good lineup of fresh cuts.
We'll move some units locally.

12:32.002 --> 12:33.117
— Yeah.
— But, Davis,

12:33.253 --> 12:35.790
there's nothing here
that can go national.

12:36.798 --> 12:38.709
(lnhales)

12:38.842 --> 12:41.879
What? Wayne? Juvie?

12:42.971 --> 12:45.462
— You think you can rope them?
— Mystikal?

12:45.599 --> 12:47.214
— I thought you said he was in jail.
— He is.

12:47.351 --> 12:49.433
I'm just hoping he left
a track or two behind

12:49.561 --> 12:51.768
— before he went away.
- Doubtful.

12:54.816 --> 12:56.602
What was that other
young man's name —

12:56.735 --> 12:58.771
the one that you were playing
for me in the car, Davis?

12:58.904 --> 13:00.895
What, the Big Tymers cut?
Mannie Fresh?

13:01.031 --> 13:04.239
You might have a shot with Mannie.
I heard he's in town for the holidays.

13:04.368 --> 13:08.156
Settled, then. We shall seek
an appointment with Mr. Fresh.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.529
We?

13:12.125 --> 13:14.912
(Boat horn blows)

13:24.972 --> 13:26.963
(Guitar playing)

13:39.277 --> 13:43.020
You know, the funeral Sunday,
all those musicians who showed up,

13:43.156 --> 13:45.067
made me kind of proud.

13:45.200 --> 13:48.192
I mean, at the end there
outside the church

13:48.328 --> 13:51.786
I felt like I was part of something,
whether you knew him or not.

13:51.915 --> 13:53.906
Yeah, it felt right.

13:55.836 --> 13:58.953
You didn't tell me about what it was like
playing with Shawn Colvin.

13:59.089 --> 14:02.673
— How did that happen?
— She saw me on Frenchmen Street.

14:02.801 --> 14:05.042
She asked me
to come down to sound check

14:05.178 --> 14:07.089
and we worked up a song.

14:08.181 --> 14:11.298
- Very cool.
— At the end of the set

14:11.435 --> 14:13.847
she introduced me to her manager —

14:13.979 --> 14:16.641
— this dude from Austin.
— Austin, huh?

14:16.773 --> 14:19.640
Like he's gonna sign me right up
'cause Shawn tells him so.

14:19.776 --> 14:22.062
— No interest?
- No.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.861
— I gotta sing, I know.
- Notjust sing.

14:28.994 --> 14:33.283
You want to reach for a brass ring,
you gotta write.

14:39.796 --> 14:42.458
(Boat horn blows)

15:02.319 --> 15:04.105
Oh.

15:05.322 --> 15:07.938
Jesus, Mary and Joseph,
this is great.

15:08.075 --> 15:12.284
Same dishes since the '40s,
damn near the same decor too.

15:12.412 --> 15:15.279
| asked to take you to dinner,
I figured August or Bayona,

15:15.415 --> 15:19.158
— something in town.
— Well, to me this is special.

15:21.463 --> 15:23.579
Thing of it is,
what's great about Mosca's

15:23.715 --> 15:26.206
is the same thing New Orleans
struggles with in a way.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.133
— What's that?
— Change.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.344
Nobody wants the city to change,

15:31.473 --> 15:33.464
not ever, not in any way.

15:34.434 --> 15:37.392
French have it.
Americans come downriver with cotton.

15:37.521 --> 15:40.934
They get called "new money trash"
and they gotta build their mansions upriver.

15:41.066 --> 15:43.603
Years later the Standard Oil men
come down here.

15:43.735 --> 15:45.441
Cotton kings stick up their noses.

15:45.570 --> 15:47.652
They don't invite them
to the Mardi Gras balls.

15:47.781 --> 15:51.239
— So the oil money goes to Houston.
- And now?

15:51.993 --> 15:53.733
Now we're a flooded—out wreck,

15:53.870 --> 15:57.033
trying to scratch it out
on whatever tourist dollars are left.

15:57.582 --> 15:59.834
And still if you want to build
anything down here,

15:59.960 --> 16:01.791
change anything,
modernize anything,

16:01.920 --> 16:04.377
you get looked upon as the problem.

16:04.506 --> 16:06.292
That's crazy.

16:06.424 --> 16:08.631
— What's this?
— Oysters Mosca.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.751
Unbelievable.

16:13.181 --> 16:16.298
Mm. But we need to change.
We have to.

16:17.060 --> 16:19.927
And to bring change to New Orleans,
there are a lot of arguments that,

16:20.063 --> 16:22.270
if they can be avoided,
they should be -

16:22.399 --> 16:24.230
arguments that are off—point,

16:24.359 --> 16:28.227
that don't have to do with the actual merits
of what anybody's trying to do.

16:28.363 --> 16:30.979
— No doubt.
— Pop quiz, Nelson.

16:31.116 --> 16:33.653
What's the next step
after demolition and removal?

16:33.785 --> 16:36.948
— We build something.
— Don't get ahead of yourself.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.910
Planning, land use.

16:45.046 --> 16:48.834
And what, Mr. Nelson Hidalgo
of Dallas, Texas,

16:48.967 --> 16:51.549
is your greatest asset to us
when it comes to planning?

16:53.597 --> 16:56.760
Nobody in this town knows
Nelson Hidalgo from a hole in the ground.

16:58.894 --> 17:00.759
Don't sleep on
the chicken a la grande.

17:00.896 --> 17:03.103
The first bite will make you
weep like a baby.

17:03.231 --> 17:05.062
Ooh.

17:20.165 --> 17:22.872
— Sofia, where were you?
— I went for a walk.

17:23.001 --> 17:25.993
l was calling.
lt's ten o'clock at night.

17:26.755 --> 17:30.168
You didn't go to your afterschool internship.
You left your book bag in your locker.

17:30.300 --> 17:33.292
— You had them check my locker?
— Sof, l was worried.

17:34.346 --> 17:36.632
— Where were you?
- Out.

17:37.432 --> 17:39.343
I'm gonna need more
of an answer than that.

17:39.476 --> 17:42.218
Why? l was out.
It's the truth.

17:42.354 --> 17:44.515
I didn't do anything
I'm not supposed to do.

17:44.648 --> 17:46.764
I didn't go anywhere I'm
not supposed to go.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.892
— Sofia.
— It's the truth.

17:50.028 --> 17:52.189
I'm not lying to you.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.818
- (Police radio chatter)
- (Siren whoops)

18:16.972 --> 18:20.009
— Dead as Kelsey's nuts, huh?
- Three shots, semiautomatic.

18:20.141 --> 18:22.177
Homicide's been notified,
but they're backed up,

18:22.310 --> 18:24.050
calling in the guys from home.

18:24.187 --> 18:26.223
It's the first for us.
It's the fourth citywide.

18:26.356 --> 18:28.768
Crazy.
8—10 to dispatch.

18:28.900 --> 18:33.109
- (Woman) Go ahead, 8-10.
— Could you give us an ETA for homicide?

18:33.238 --> 18:34.444
Stand by.

18:34.572 --> 18:36.403
J‘ Thinking

18:36.533 --> 18:38.990
J‘ Trying to make up your mind

18:39.119 --> 18:41.656
J‘ Your folks asleep

18:41.788 --> 18:44.120
J‘ Let's not waste any time

18:44.249 --> 18:46.240
J‘ I know it's late

18:46.376 --> 18:49.368
J‘ And now I can't wait

18:49.504 --> 18:52.246
J‘ Let's steal away

18:54.175 --> 18:56.791
J‘ I know it's wrong

18:56.928 --> 18:59.214
J‘ Asking this of you

18:59.347 --> 19:02.339
J‘ There's no other way

19:02.475 --> 19:05.057
J‘ I can be with you

19:05.186 --> 19:07.142
J‘ If only your folks

19:07.272 --> 19:09.684
J‘ Would approve

19:09.816 --> 19:12.148
J‘ Seeing like this

19:12.277 --> 19:14.768
J‘ We wouldn't have to do

19:14.904 --> 19:17.691
J‘ No, no, lwon't tell

19:17.824 --> 19:20.941
J‘ Anybody else

19:21.077 --> 19:22.988
J‘ I'm gonna keep it

19:23.121 --> 19:25.737
J‘ All to myself

19:25.874 --> 19:27.705
J‘ I know it's late

19:27.834 --> 19:31.952
J‘ And now I can't wait,
let's steal away...

19:32.088 --> 19:34.044
(Man) Say, brah.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.878
Brah.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.673
Yo, brah!

19:42.932 --> 19:45.184
| just was gonna ask
where my change at.

19:52.817 --> 19:54.978
(Groaning)

20:05.830 --> 20:08.242
— Are you OK?
— You're in charge.

20:08.375 --> 20:11.412
Do what you need to do.
Close up as best you can.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.535
(Car lock chirps)

20:32.607 --> 20:35.974
(Dispatcher) 8-01.
(Man on radio) You just had a call for me?

20:36.111 --> 20:38.397
(Dispatcher) Disregard it.

20:38.530 --> 20:40.521
(Radio chatter continues)

20:49.082 --> 20:51.368
Lieutenant, sign here.

21:05.265 --> 21:07.551
(Camera shutter clicking)

21:30.457 --> 21:33.449
(Man) Things can't be that quiet
in the French Quarter.

21:36.379 --> 21:39.462
Bad one here — a heater.

21:39.591 --> 21:41.582
I heard.

21:41.718 --> 21:44.835
I came past to see
if you guys need manpower.

21:44.971 --> 21:47.337
I can spare a couple guys
for your canvass.

21:47.474 --> 21:49.760
No, we're good.

21:49.893 --> 21:52.509
He's crouched in the corner there
holding the little boy.

21:53.271 --> 21:55.262
Protecting him.

21:56.858 --> 21:59.190
Wife went first,
one shot to the neck.

21:59.319 --> 22:01.150
She dies quick,
so not much blood.

22:01.279 --> 22:04.146
Uh-huh.
And the husband?

22:04.282 --> 22:07.194
He's asleep in the bed with the son?

22:07.327 --> 22:08.692
So he says.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.739
One shot, grazes him in the cheek.

22:10.872 --> 22:13.113
Says he gets up,
he runs to the bathroom.

22:13.249 --> 22:15.956
Two more shots -
the forearm and the hand.

22:16.085 --> 22:18.701
Still he looks good, the kid too.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.294
Looks like a straight—up robbery.

22:20.423 --> 22:22.163
But, Terry, the way this guy played it...

22:22.300 --> 22:24.916
The guy's shot three times.
He's in the fucking hospital, right?

22:25.053 --> 22:26.839
You didn't see how he reacted
to his wife's death.

22:26.971 --> 22:29.178
The guy's in shock.
I fucking would be.

22:29.307 --> 22:31.218
I got a feeling about this.

22:35.813 --> 22:38.600
(Grunts) Wow,

22:39.359 --> 22:41.816
— you're up early.
— Mm—hm.

22:41.945 --> 22:43.856
Today | write a song.

22:43.988 --> 22:45.774
What?

22:46.574 --> 22:48.314
Really? Can I help?

22:48.451 --> 22:52.785
Oh, I'm not sure you should.
I think it has to be my song.

22:58.253 --> 23:01.245
So what are you gonna start with,

23:01.381 --> 23:04.839
- the melody or the lyrics?
— Which do you start with?

23:04.968 --> 23:07.755
— Lyrics.
— Oh, well, melody for me, then.

23:09.055 --> 23:10.841
(Laughs)

23:10.974 --> 23:14.182
- Where are you going?
— I got a business meeting.

23:16.646 --> 23:19.103
Dressed like that?

23:19.232 --> 23:21.689
It's the music business.

23:23.861 --> 23:25.692
(Man over radio) 8—41.

23:27.240 --> 23:29.777
(Dispatcher) Go ahead, 8—41.

23:29.909 --> 23:33.993
(8—41) Did you say a white Lexus?
(Dispatcher) Negative, 8-41.

23:34.122 --> 23:37.080
A white Lincoln. Copy?

23:37.208 --> 23:38.948
(8—41) Copy that.

23:39.085 --> 23:41.041
Is it clean?

23:41.170 --> 23:45.004
(Dispatcher) The title and registration
are valid. License is also valid.

24:02.775 --> 24:06.563
You guys know that you had
a call for service 18 minutes earlier

24:06.696 --> 24:09.153
overat2460?

24:09.282 --> 24:11.773
I mean, it's only a few houses away,
for Christ's sake.

24:11.909 --> 24:13.649
We got that, yeah.

24:13.786 --> 24:16.823
And your guys still like the husband?

24:17.832 --> 24:19.538
Seriously, John?

24:19.667 --> 24:22.625
The more we talk to him,
the better he looks.

24:35.475 --> 24:38.308
Attach this to an invoice
for 32 billable hours

24:38.436 --> 24:41.553
noted as "fee waived"
and overnight it to Massachusetts.

24:41.689 --> 24:44.101
Why bother with that
if you're not gonna bill him?

24:44.233 --> 24:46.019
Reality check.
I need the guy to know

24:46.152 --> 24:48.564
how much it would cost to keep going
and I can't keep going.

24:48.696 --> 24:50.152
— OK.
— l'm dealing with a new mortgage,

24:50.281 --> 24:52.272
an old one on a house that won't sell,

24:52.408 --> 24:54.899
an angry—all—the—time daughter
who is for sure gonna pick

24:55.036 --> 24:57.197
the most expensive
East Coast college in a year.

24:57.330 --> 24:59.070
Oh yeah, and Cray's pension payout

24:59.207 --> 25:03.200
doesn't come to half his teaching salary.
I need to work paying cases.

25:03.336 --> 25:05.042
— OK.
— So the rest of the day

25:05.171 --> 25:08.254
is prep for this afternoon's hearing.
So no calls — nothing.

25:08.383 --> 25:10.590
You get another walk—in,
we're not lawyers.

25:10.718 --> 25:14.677
We sell insurance,
do window treatments, whatever.

25:16.766 --> 25:19.257
Le Bernardin?
I'm looking for the service area.

25:19.394 --> 25:21.635
— That door over there.
- Thank you.

25:37.370 --> 25:39.281
- Hello.
— How are you doing? How can I help you?

25:39.414 --> 25:41.325
I'm looking for Chef Ripert.
l have an appointment.

25:41.457 --> 25:44.073
— Elevator up.
- Thank you.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.417
(Chef) Chanterelle, lobster...

25:55.680 --> 25:59.468
— Chef.
— Hello. Please sit down.

26:00.476 --> 26:02.683
— Good to see you again, Chef.
— Nice to see you, Chef.

26:02.812 --> 26:06.475
But now you are the woman
who throws drinks at Alan Richman's face.

26:06.607 --> 26:08.438
I guess I'm gonna have to
live with that, yes.

26:08.568 --> 26:10.604
You know, actually
Alan is a friend of mine.

26:10.737 --> 26:12.773
We get along very well.

26:12.905 --> 26:15.692
But you are a good cook
and we like good cooks at Le Bernardin.

26:16.617 --> 26:19.984
OK, business.
We have a very different system here.

26:20.121 --> 26:22.453
Understand this.
You will start at the garde manger.

26:22.582 --> 26:24.322
Everybody starts at the garde manger.

26:24.459 --> 26:27.792
Even if you were the chef de cuisine
at Ducasse, you start at the garde manger.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.912
After what I did,
l'll feel lucky to have a job.

26:31.048 --> 26:34.211
— C'etait vraiment un sazerac?
— Oui, Chef, un sazerac.

26:36.387 --> 26:38.127
(Boat horn blowing)

26:40.475 --> 26:45.014
(Mimi) l was under the impression Mr. Fresh
was going to meet us here in person.

26:45.146 --> 26:47.979
Ah, well, it's the first
he's been home since the storm,

26:48.107 --> 26:51.349
so he'd rather have this
as a phone meeting.

26:56.282 --> 26:58.273
OK.

27:07.752 --> 27:09.743
LaDonna.

27:10.838 --> 27:12.829
LaDonna.

27:16.469 --> 27:19.176
LaDonna honey,
it's damn near noon.

27:21.057 --> 27:23.218
I'll be up in a bit, Ma.

27:34.237 --> 27:37.775
- (Phone rings)
— (Woman) Councilmember Thomas's office.

27:37.907 --> 27:40.364
That hearing you asked about
is in 15 minutes.

27:40.493 --> 27:42.324
Do you want me to send
someone to monitor it?

27:42.453 --> 27:45.445
— No, I kind of want to check it out myself.
— OK.

27:52.463 --> 27:54.840
Young lady. Miss Bernette.

27:54.966 --> 27:56.831
You want to take a walk?

27:57.844 --> 27:59.675
OK, sure.

28:10.147 --> 28:14.140
Understand, it's not personal with Mannie.
It's just his sense of time.

28:15.820 --> 28:18.106
Can we give him a call, then, and...

28:19.323 --> 28:21.939
— see where he's at?
- Sure.

28:28.499 --> 28:31.957
(Phone ringing)

28:33.671 --> 28:37.380
— What's up?
— Mannie, it's Ron Remsberg calling.

28:37.508 --> 28:39.373
Mr. McAlary is here for your meeting.

28:39.510 --> 28:42.001
— Oh shit, yeah. A'ight, let's roll with it then.
— (Whispering)

28:42.138 --> 28:46.222
- All right, go ahead.
— Hey Mannie. It's me — DJ Davis.

28:48.811 --> 28:51.177
| used to be at 0—2.

28:51.314 --> 28:54.772
l was the one who got fired for playing
too much local rap and bounce.

28:54.901 --> 28:57.233
Yeah, Davis, right.
How you been, brah?

28:57.361 --> 29:00.649
— Yeah, good, good, man.
— Come on, man, get to the point.

29:00.781 --> 29:03.272
Yeah, OK. Well,

29:04.285 --> 29:07.152
we're putting together a sampler,
right, starting a new label,

29:07.288 --> 29:10.075
trying to bring a little more of the world
to New Orleans hip—hop.

29:10.207 --> 29:12.789
— Mm—hm.
— And what we could really use

29:12.919 --> 29:14.750
to give this thing some real weight

29:14.879 --> 29:17.871
is one or two tracks from you —
fresh tracks, brah,

29:18.007 --> 29:19.963
Mannie Fresh.

29:21.677 --> 29:23.963
Your work with Big Tymers,

29:24.096 --> 29:27.133
Birdman and Wayne -
man, you've been down on some...

29:27.266 --> 29:29.052
classics, man.

29:29.185 --> 29:32.222
Uh, let's see, Still Fly,
Back That Thing Up, Bring It Back.

29:32.355 --> 29:35.893
Come on, man, you know the law of the L—O.
You're jock—riding without a seat belt.

29:36.025 --> 29:38.482
— And on top of that I know my stuff.
— I know.

29:38.611 --> 29:40.442
I'm sorry,
I was just saying...

29:40.571 --> 29:42.436
Look, brah, I can't help you right now.

29:42.573 --> 29:44.188
I got my children.
I got my own label.

29:44.325 --> 29:46.816
I got dudes on my back.
It's just not a good time for me.

29:46.953 --> 29:48.784
— Aw, man, well...
— I think we're done here.

29:48.913 --> 29:50.904
If I may...

29:52.667 --> 29:55.158
"Fuck the fame.
Fuck the power.

29:55.294 --> 29:57.285
"Fuck the fake—ass friends.

29:57.421 --> 29:59.002
"We gonna do it like this

29:59.131 --> 30:02.168
"from the nine—six
to the nine—seven era,

30:02.301 --> 30:04.917
"taking over one state at a time,

30:05.054 --> 30:07.466
"one rhyme after one rhyme."

30:08.516 --> 30:13.055
Mr. Fresh, seems to me like somebody's
forgetting where they came from.

30:13.187 --> 30:15.018
What? Who the fuck
is that talking?

30:15.147 --> 30:19.356
- Mannie, I'll finish up from here.
— Mannie, hey, my...my assistant...

30:19.485 --> 30:22.067
- That's his teedie.
— His teedie? How she roll?

30:22.196 --> 30:25.063
Garden—style,
past Jackson definitely.

30:25.199 --> 30:27.485
You DJ Davis' auntie
from the Garden District

30:27.618 --> 30:29.358
and you're dropping
my own tracks on me?

30:29.495 --> 30:31.360
For real? What she look like?

30:31.497 --> 30:34.409
— Flossing Chanel, rocking Louis.
- Oh, you already know.

30:34.542 --> 30:36.828
Wow, really, Davis?

30:36.961 --> 30:38.792
Mannie, I'm sorry.

30:38.921 --> 30:42.254
Fuck it, l'm—a give
your greedy teedie a track. Ron.

30:43.551 --> 30:45.667
- Yeah, Mannie?
— Go ahead, hook the lady up.

30:45.803 --> 30:48.966
— I'm out, dude.
- OK.

30:53.769 --> 30:54.724
What?

30:54.854 --> 30:57.311
(Bernette) Which is to say, Your Honor,
that this case is scheduled

30:57.440 --> 31:01.103
for a settlement conference next month
and the plaintiffs had every hope of reaching

31:01.235 --> 31:03.442
a settlement with the city
about a fee reduction.

31:03.571 --> 31:05.607
The fact remains that we are well into

31:05.740 --> 31:07.731
this year's second—line parade season.

31:07.867 --> 31:10.825
And as Miss Schwartzmann
made clear in her own remarks,

31:10.953 --> 31:13.069
several of the social aid
and pleasure clubs

31:13.205 --> 31:15.821
are in danger of canceling their parades.

31:16.375 --> 31:20.994
Next week, in fact, the Pigeon Town Club
is facing a deadline from the city

31:21.130 --> 31:25.419
on fees in excess of $5,000.

31:25.551 --> 31:27.712
— (Schwartzmann) Your Honor, may I interject?
- Proceed.

31:27.845 --> 31:30.131
The officers from the Pigeon Town Steppers
have informed me

31:30.264 --> 31:32.175
that their fees
based on their parade route

31:32.308 --> 31:34.890
and the police concerns
about violence on that route

31:35.019 --> 31:37.852
are now $7,560.

31:38.856 --> 31:42.644
I needed to see for myself if this thing's
any closer to getting settled.

31:43.819 --> 31:47.107
And I thought you'd get a kick
out of watching your mama do her thing.

31:47.239 --> 31:50.026
She's on the side of the angels here.

31:50.159 --> 31:53.947
(Bernette) ...fees 10 times that from clubs
that might only have two dozen members.

31:54.080 --> 31:56.412
And by the time we get
to a settlement conference

31:56.540 --> 31:59.498
half the spring parade season
will have passed and we'll be at carnival.

31:59.627 --> 32:02.289
When you compare the burden
being placed on the clubs

32:02.421 --> 32:05.629
and what is being asked
of the more affluent Mardi Gras krewes,

32:05.758 --> 32:07.749
there is frankly the suggestion

32:07.885 --> 32:10.672
of a cultural and even racial bias.

32:12.890 --> 32:14.972
(Batiste) She ain't gonna
come in at all tonight?

32:15.101 --> 32:18.468
She's up in Baton Rouge.
Miss LaDee ain't been doing so good

32:18.604 --> 32:20.640
ever since the beatdown, you know.

32:20.773 --> 32:24.015
Where the hell are you gonna
book us at next? At a daiquiri stand?

32:24.151 --> 32:25.982
Motherfucker,
y'all just need to get closer

32:26.112 --> 32:28.194
and pretend
y'all like each other a little bit.

32:29.824 --> 32:32.315
- Hey, where Terrell at?
— With the Hot 8 over there at the Blue Nile.

32:32.451 --> 32:35.318
- He got a sub?
— No sub. One trumpet — just me.

32:35.454 --> 32:37.661
— And Tim sitting in for Roderick again?
- Seems like.

32:37.790 --> 32:39.280
Oh man.

32:39.416 --> 32:41.998
Got a nine—piece band
with 54 fucking pieces.

32:42.128 --> 32:43.789
- Shit.
— (Laughter)

32:47.591 --> 32:49.297
Hey, Oliver.

32:49.426 --> 32:52.759
- Hey, how've you been, Katy?
— I'm good. You got a comment for me?

32:52.888 --> 32:54.594
— About what? Parade fees?
- Yeah.

32:54.723 --> 32:56.634
Well, look, the storm bankrupted the city.

32:56.767 --> 32:58.723
I don't doubt that we need
to raise some money somehow.

32:58.853 --> 33:00.559
Some of the clubs said
they reached out to you,

33:00.688 --> 33:03.430
that they wish that you'd be
more of a public advocate for the culture.

33:03.566 --> 33:06.308
Off the record, I'm talking
to the mayor and Riley privately,

33:06.443 --> 33:08.820
— trying to find some middle ground.
— And on the record?

33:08.946 --> 33:11.437
On the record,
I hope we find some middle ground.

33:11.574 --> 33:13.485
Nothing else?

33:13.617 --> 33:15.653
Hey, what did you think of your mom?

33:16.912 --> 33:19.995
— Everything all right between y'all?
— ljust didn't want to bother her.

33:20.124 --> 33:22.331
She seemed pretty busy in there.

33:23.335 --> 33:27.328
So if you think she's on the side
of the angels, why don't you just say so?

33:27.464 --> 33:31.002
You could come out against
the fee increases and side with the clubs.

33:31.135 --> 33:33.126
| go against Nagin or Riley right now,

33:33.262 --> 33:35.719
I might not have them
when I need them for something else later.

33:35.848 --> 33:38.430
$7,000 for the Pigeon Town Steppers?

33:39.143 --> 33:41.304
OK, look, you're right.
I'm a politician.

33:41.437 --> 33:44.474
What I show in public
might not be what I do in private.

33:44.607 --> 33:47.474
What I say to the mayor
might not be what I say to your mom,

33:47.610 --> 33:49.771
the clubs or some
newspaper reporter.

33:49.904 --> 33:52.816
But I can promise you, young lady,
a couple of weeks from now

33:52.948 --> 33:55.360
Pigeon Town gonna be stepping.

33:58.662 --> 34:01.039
You put whatever you want into it.

34:01.165 --> 34:03.702
Beyond that, anyone that | send,

34:03.834 --> 34:07.326
you get 2.5 points
on whatever they bring.

34:08.339 --> 34:10.170
Fair enough.

34:17.223 --> 34:19.509
Anything...

34:20.309 --> 34:22.641
inside that.

34:22.770 --> 34:24.476
Just curious —

34:24.605 --> 34:28.063
— what's coming?
— Oh, I don't know what's coming.

34:28.192 --> 34:30.774
And we never had this conversation.

34:32.446 --> 34:35.233
— Just a hunch, then, huh?
— Just a hunch.

34:35.366 --> 34:37.197
But you never gamble.

34:40.704 --> 34:42.911
I'm on it.

34:43.040 --> 34:45.702
(McAlary) I'm her nephew.
l'm authorized to use the card.

34:45.834 --> 34:47.961
OK, she's in the other room.
Hold on.

34:48.087 --> 34:51.250
Hey, you're
Mary Margaret McAlary

34:51.382 --> 34:53.293
and you authorize
the charge on your Visa.

34:53.425 --> 34:56.212
— What?
— Yeah, it's cool. Just do it.

34:59.181 --> 35:00.921
Hello.

35:01.058 --> 35:03.299
Yes, this is Mary.

35:04.687 --> 35:06.973
Yes, he's my nephew

35:07.106 --> 35:09.438
and I authorize the charge.

35:09.566 --> 35:11.773
All right, thank you.

35:13.654 --> 35:15.736
OK, are we cool?
You got everything?

35:15.864 --> 35:18.901
All right, home delivery tomorrow.

35:19.034 --> 35:21.025
Great, thanks.

35:21.161 --> 35:24.779
Davis, I'm not sure I like you
sending stuff to ex—girlfriends.

35:24.915 --> 35:26.701
It's not about that.

35:27.251 --> 35:31.540
It's about honoring
an act of heroism... or terrorism.

35:32.381 --> 35:34.497
— How much did you buy?
- Half a case.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.339
That's very generous...

35:36.468 --> 35:38.675
- on your aunt's card.
— She's fronting me the cash —

35:38.804 --> 35:40.886
advance against
future sales of the CD.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.551
Yeah, future sales.

35:44.560 --> 35:46.516
I said it.

35:47.021 --> 35:50.354
J‘ If we should be alone

35:51.066 --> 35:52.852
J‘ Just walk on by

35:53.277 --> 35:55.893
J‘ Baby, my darling

35:56.030 --> 35:59.943
J‘ Honey, please don't cry

36:00.075 --> 36:02.657
J‘ 'Cause tonight we'll be

36:02.786 --> 36:04.322
J‘ Yeah, yeah

36:04.455 --> 36:07.037
J‘ At the dark end

36:07.166 --> 36:09.999
J‘ Of the street

36:10.127 --> 36:12.869
J‘ You and

36:13.005 --> 36:16.964
— J‘ Me J‘
— (Whistling, cheering)

36:17.092 --> 36:19.048
Yeah!

36:21.430 --> 36:23.842
Wanda Rouzan, baby.
Wanda Rouzan.

36:23.974 --> 36:27.262
Yeah, it's always good
to see one of the ladies

36:27.394 --> 36:31.262
embracing the delights of marital infidelity.

36:31.398 --> 36:34.105
(Laughter)

36:34.234 --> 36:37.567
— Blame the girls too, yeah. Right, fellas?
— (Men) Yeah!

36:38.155 --> 36:40.942
'Cause when it comes
to stolen love, Antoine Batiste

36:41.075 --> 36:43.532
has always been
forced to be the villain.

36:43.660 --> 36:48.154
— Come on, hit me, my brothers.
- (J‘ Slip Away)

36:52.586 --> 36:54.918
Oh! Oh!

36:55.631 --> 36:58.122
Here we go!

36:58.258 --> 37:02.001
Come on now.
Come on.

37:02.137 --> 37:04.219
J‘ What would I give

37:04.723 --> 37:07.635
J‘ Oh, forjust a brief moment

37:10.479 --> 37:13.937
J‘ What would I give

37:14.066 --> 37:16.148
J‘ Just to have you near... J‘

37:16.276 --> 37:18.608
(Reporter) A young black man shot
and killed on the streets,

37:18.737 --> 37:21.479
and those left behind
in their community are angry

37:21.615 --> 37:23.606
that even in a brand—new year...

37:23.742 --> 37:27.234
- I'm gonna turn in, baby.
— OK, I'll be in after this here.

37:27.371 --> 37:29.703
All right.

37:29.832 --> 37:32.414
— Good night, ma—in—law.
— Good night.

37:34.420 --> 37:37.207
I thought you were supposed
to mind the bar through to Saturday.

37:38.424 --> 37:40.506
The bar can mind itself.

37:40.634 --> 37:42.795
(Reporter) ...when he heard
the shot that killed him.

37:42.928 --> 37:44.884
(Man on TV) l was going just...
I was like,

37:45.013 --> 37:47.550
"Son, hold on.
Son, you're gonna be all right."

37:47.683 --> 37:51.392
J‘ Slip away, slip away

37:51.520 --> 37:54.762
J‘ Slip away

37:54.898 --> 37:57.150
J‘ Uh, I need you so

37:57.985 --> 37:59.771
J‘ Yes, I do

38:01.405 --> 38:06.195
J‘ Love, oh love

38:06.326 --> 38:08.237
J‘ How sweet it is

38:10.622 --> 38:12.533
J‘ When you steal it

38:13.041 --> 38:14.781
J‘ Oh, girl

38:14.918 --> 38:16.829
J‘ How sweet it is

38:16.962 --> 38:18.327
J‘Oh

38:18.464 --> 38:21.297
Oh, lgot something
to say now, baby.

38:22.801 --> 38:24.177
J‘ Listen, everybody

38:24.303 --> 38:28.091
— Come on now, break it down.
- (Band playing quieter)

38:28.223 --> 38:30.054
Oh yeah.

38:30.184 --> 38:31.970
Breaking it down now.

38:34.313 --> 38:36.304
J‘ Listen, ladies

38:36.440 --> 38:39.352
J‘ Oh, listen, little girl... J‘

38:39.485 --> 38:41.441
- All right.
— J‘ Sometime tonight

38:44.364 --> 38:46.741
J‘ When you get a little lonely

38:48.452 --> 38:50.693
J‘ I want you to slip on out

38:56.877 --> 38:59.334
J‘ Where all the midnight lovers meet

38:59.463 --> 39:02.330
J‘ 'Cause | just want to see you tonight... J‘

39:02.466 --> 39:05.173
Oh, you do with your big self?

39:05.636 --> 39:08.548
J‘ Now you might think
I'm a wrongdoing man

39:10.974 --> 39:13.465
J‘ I'm not a wrongdoing man, no

39:14.478 --> 39:19.188
J‘ 'Cause if loving this big, fine,
red—lips, big—booty girl is wrong

39:19.316 --> 39:21.523
J‘ I don't want to be right

39:21.652 --> 39:24.485
J‘ | just want to see you tonight

39:25.614 --> 39:29.732
J‘ Slip away, slip away

39:29.868 --> 39:32.405
J‘ Slip away

39:32.538 --> 39:35.154
J‘ Oh, I need you so... J‘

39:37.793 --> 39:40.159
Delivery for me.

39:41.755 --> 39:43.461
— Want a smoke?
— No way.

39:43.590 --> 39:45.330
It's my first day at Le Bernardin.

39:45.467 --> 39:48.004
— I'm working the lunch service.
— Oh, that's right.

39:48.136 --> 39:50.593
- Congrats.
— Oh, I'm happy to be working anywhere

39:50.722 --> 39:54.089
after what I pulled, but Le Bernardin...

39:54.226 --> 39:56.137
l'm dipped in shit, you know?

39:56.270 --> 39:58.886
I hear Ripert is good to work for.

39:59.022 --> 40:01.809
Better than the shithead
that I'm slinging sauce under.

40:02.484 --> 40:05.567
— Are you looking for a new gig?
— Maybe.

40:05.696 --> 40:07.402
New year, new kitchen.

40:07.531 --> 40:09.863
What did you win?

40:09.992 --> 40:12.734
Rye, half a case.

40:12.869 --> 40:15.997
Plus Herbsaint

40:16.123 --> 40:19.286
— and Peychaud bitters.
- What's all that for?

40:19.418 --> 40:22.034
— Sazerac.
— (Coughs, chuckles)

40:25.465 --> 40:27.456
Of course.

40:31.263 --> 40:34.426
J‘ Try so hard

40:37.769 --> 40:39.725
J‘ But I fall

40:39.855 --> 40:43.097
J‘ I can't carry us both

40:43.233 --> 40:45.349
J‘ I must walk

40:46.069 --> 40:50.358
J‘ Away from this

40:50.490 --> 40:53.573
J‘ And say my goodbyes J‘

40:57.581 --> 40:59.617
Then the instrumental refrain

40:59.750 --> 41:02.116
and then back around,
repeat the verse

41:02.252 --> 41:05.585
and out on the chorus.

41:06.089 --> 41:09.752
— It's beautiful.
—(Laughs)

41:09.885 --> 41:12.797
I love the descending bass
as the chorus resolves.

41:12.929 --> 41:14.715
It's nice.

41:15.349 --> 41:18.261
Yeah, it really worked for me.

41:19.770 --> 41:22.762
— (Kettle whistling)
— Oh, tea's up.

41:25.776 --> 41:28.939
— I wrote a song, bitches.
— (Davis chuckles)

41:34.034 --> 41:36.400
— (Mutters)
— Shh.

41:40.457 --> 41:42.448
Take these to the curb.

41:43.460 --> 41:45.542
— Good morning, Chef.
— Good morning, Fernando.

41:45.671 --> 41:47.582
— (Elevator dings)
— Good morning, Chef.

41:47.714 --> 41:49.545
Good morning.

41:57.140 --> 42:00.632
— Hi, I'm Chris, the chef de cuisine.
- Janette Desautel.

42:00.769 --> 42:02.634
— Good morning, Chef.
— Good morning.

42:02.771 --> 42:05.103
This is garde manger.
We have three chefs.

42:05.232 --> 42:08.395
You're gonna be number four.
I want you to learn the pounded tuna first.

42:08.527 --> 42:10.267
It's our most popular appetizer.

42:10.404 --> 42:14.067
You'll work here with Victor,
Colby and Bill. All right?

42:15.075 --> 42:16.986
Hi, I'm Soa.
Welcome to Le Bernardin.

42:17.119 --> 42:18.325
Thank you.

42:20.205 --> 42:22.412
I appreciate this,
but something had to give.

42:22.541 --> 42:26.500
There's just too much casework
and things are not so good at home.

42:26.628 --> 42:28.414
Don't worry.
This will be a great exercise

42:28.547 --> 42:30.378
for some of the third—year law students.

42:31.842 --> 42:34.003
— Are you gonna go to the march?
- The march?

42:34.136 --> 42:36.047
Oh, that shooting in the Marigny.

42:36.179 --> 42:37.680
I don't know.

42:37.806 --> 42:41.549
Remember the one in '96
after the Louisiana pizza kitchen killings?

42:41.685 --> 42:44.097
— A few hundred protesters tops.
- Most of them white.

42:44.229 --> 42:46.140
Hopefully that's not this time though.

42:47.941 --> 42:51.229
You know, you might want to start
by filing a public records request.

42:51.361 --> 42:52.771
-We will.
— lt'sjust...

42:52.904 --> 42:55.190
Toni, we got this, I promise.

42:55.323 --> 42:57.814
I want you to concentrate
on what's important, OK?

42:57.951 --> 42:59.566
Oh, thanks, Majeeda.

43:00.746 --> 43:03.203
J‘ Try so hard

43:05.709 --> 43:07.449
J‘ But I fall

43:07.586 --> 43:10.578
J‘ I can't carry us both

43:10.714 --> 43:12.454
J‘ I must walk

43:12.591 --> 43:15.549
J‘ Away from this

43:15.677 --> 43:18.589
J‘ And say my goodbyes J‘

43:20.724 --> 43:22.806
Nice. You wrote a hit.

43:23.769 --> 43:26.351
— It isn't that good.
— Oh, I don't know.

43:26.480 --> 43:28.846
Don't Think Twice
did all right for Bobby Dylan.

43:30.609 --> 43:32.691
I mean, you changed the progression

43:32.819 --> 43:34.775
so it doesn't go back to the two,

43:34.905 --> 43:37.191
but other than that, I gotta say,

43:37.866 --> 43:39.857
at least you're stealing big.

43:41.411 --> 43:43.197
Fuck.

43:44.498 --> 43:46.489
— Look...
— Fuck.

43:57.260 --> 43:59.342
(J‘ Jazz music playing)

44:06.478 --> 44:08.935
(Footsteps, coughing)

44:12.192 --> 44:14.353
Who do you think
you're fooling, Chief?

44:14.486 --> 44:16.943
The man at the mid—city branch
said they might start

44:17.072 --> 44:19.154
delivering again by next month, or not.

44:19.282 --> 44:21.273
Or not.

44:23.203 --> 44:27.196
(J‘ Mississippi Fred McDowell:
Wish I Was In Heaven Sitting Down)

44:30.418 --> 44:33.125
(Singing along)

44:52.023 --> 44:54.014
(Knocking on door)

44:56.862 --> 44:58.818
(Louder knocking)

45:16.131 --> 45:18.122
Look at this.

45:18.884 --> 45:21.125
You done wrecked the place
with your nonsense.

45:21.261 --> 45:23.593
l...l'm hearing something.

45:23.722 --> 45:25.713
lt's... lt's old. It's mean.

45:25.849 --> 45:28.716
And it got...
it got mud all over it.

45:28.852 --> 45:30.638
Uh—huh.

45:30.770 --> 45:34.012
— Spare the neighbors, Delmond.
- (Turns volume down)

45:36.568 --> 45:39.150
(Humming along)

45:39.863 --> 45:42.855
— Take me out to dinner.
- I got a gig later.

45:43.700 --> 45:45.691
We got time to eat first.

45:51.791 --> 45:52.541
(J‘ Jazz playing)

45:52.667 --> 45:55.704
- What's up?
— Road Home application.

45:59.424 --> 46:01.380
(Exhales)

46:02.385 --> 46:04.171
They bounced it.

46:04.304 --> 46:06.966
They're saying because
my wife's name was on the deed

46:07.098 --> 46:09.180
they need to have
her signature on the forms.

46:11.728 --> 46:14.936
Lorraine been gone since '03.

46:15.065 --> 46:16.896
Now | musta wrote that down

46:17.025 --> 46:20.392
at least a half a dozen
times on them papers.

46:22.447 --> 46:24.403
Damn.

46:28.620 --> 46:30.156
Twenty minutes before the Helen Hill murder

46:30.288 --> 46:33.155
there's a report of
an aggravated burglary a few doors down.

46:35.502 --> 46:38.460
and he says that homicide
isn't even looking at any connection.

46:38.588 --> 46:40.920
You think they got tunnel vision?

46:41.049 --> 46:43.335
Certain cases,
you don't solve them quick,

46:43.468 --> 46:46.801
it sends a message.
And this one, a couple with a young kid,

46:46.930 --> 46:49.888
wife's a filmmaker,
husband a doctor, home invasion.

46:50.475 --> 46:54.434
— We don't want to come up empty.
— No, we don't. Look.

46:58.066 --> 47:01.308
People are scared.
They're looking at us and what do they see?

47:01.444 --> 47:04.402
Unsolved cases
or cases dumped before they get to court.

47:04.531 --> 47:07.614
And the only perp walk that makes
the news is our own guys in cuffs.

47:07.742 --> 47:10.859
You say the aggravated burglary call
is on the same block as the murder?

47:10.996 --> 47:12.736
20 minutes earlier.

47:14.791 --> 47:17.282
Chief, mark my words.
If we don't change up on this,

47:17.419 --> 47:21.458
a week from now we're gonna be sitting here
with a cleared husband, no other suspects

47:21.589 --> 47:23.796
and a murder case open
as the day is long.

47:27.053 --> 47:30.545
— I'll make mention of it to the captain.
— Thank you, Chief.

47:30.682 --> 47:32.968
(J‘ Playing "Decoy")

48:23.359 --> 48:26.021
And the ground wasn't high,
and the wind wasn't a breeze,

48:26.154 --> 48:29.612
but I walked on that shallow water
and escaped Katrina seas.

48:29.741 --> 48:32.904
And I will never die,
but they want me to leave.

48:33.036 --> 48:35.903
And the foundation's just fine
but they're blocking off the Lafitte.

48:36.039 --> 48:38.075
(Woman) You're welcome.
(Speaker) And I do cry,

48:38.208 --> 48:41.200
and I do grieve,
but when my people pass,

48:41.753 --> 48:43.459
we pull out that brass.

48:43.588 --> 48:46.876
But before we put them in the grass,
we're gonna get on that casket and dance.

48:56.559 --> 48:58.766
(Cheering and applause)

49:01.564 --> 49:03.475
(Delmond) Thank you, jazz fans.

49:03.608 --> 49:04.939
Um...

49:05.068 --> 49:08.481
We normally have our set
pretty well planned out,

49:08.613 --> 49:10.604
but, uh, you know, for...

49:11.741 --> 49:13.732
the past couple of months, man, I've been...

49:13.868 --> 49:15.779
just chasing something
in my head, you know.

49:15.912 --> 49:19.154
And it's been outrunning my ass, so...

49:19.290 --> 49:21.155
(Laughter)

49:22.460 --> 49:25.543
I'm not making much sense up here.
We're gonna get right into it.

49:26.548 --> 49:29.585
Follow me or die trying, fellas.

49:31.636 --> 49:34.969
A—one, and a—two, and a bap—doo—ba.

49:35.098 --> 49:37.305

(Percussion joins in)

49:43.439 --> 49:46.101

J‘ Play it down

50:48.796 --> 50:51.412
J‘ And do it all again... J‘

50:54.761 --> 50:57.343
And if you don't know,
then you better ask.

50:57.472 --> 50:59.929
- Ooh nah nay!
— Who got the fire?

51:00.350 --> 51:02.762
- Ooh nah nay!
— Who got the fire?

51:02.894 --> 51:05.101
(Whooping and applause)

51:07.190 --> 51:09.181
(Simply) Those guys can bring it, Davis.

51:09.317 --> 51:11.729
Hi, I'm Lil Calliope.
UTP what I represent.

51:11.861 --> 51:14.773
Every other cat up there

51:14.906 --> 51:16.692
I can front my own shit.

51:17.492 --> 51:19.574
I can. You doubt my flow?

51:19.702 --> 51:22.489

52:01.744 --> 52:03.951
(J‘ Modern jazz playing)

52:04.080 --> 52:07.117
So y'all didn't know each other
in New Orleans? You met here?

52:07.250 --> 52:11.163
Yeah, just watching the Saints game
over at the Bar None over on Third.

52:11.296 --> 52:14.208
That's where the NOLA refugees
go to catch the game at.

52:16.050 --> 52:18.541
Man, I can't believe
I up and went into Jelly Roll Morton.

52:18.678 --> 52:20.043
(Janette) l was loving it.

52:20.179 --> 52:22.135
The guys are looking at me
like I lost my mind or something.

— (Cell phone ringing)
— (Delmond) Oh.

52:27.228 --> 52:29.219
Oh, excuse me.

— He's saying he's done, Delmond.
— Done? What does he mean by that?

52:44.662 --> 52:46.493
He's saying he's done with all of it —

52:46.622 --> 52:48.999
done with masking,
with New Orleans even.

52:49.542 --> 52:52.079
He's packing his shit,
talking about leaving tomorrow.

52:52.211 --> 52:54.543
— To go where?
- Houston.

52:56.132 --> 52:58.919

52:59.052 --> 53:00.758

Oliver Thomas says

56:19.794 --> 56:22.001
the people have been heard
and it's up to them

56:22.129 --> 56:24.381
to continue fighting for a safer city.

56:24.507 --> 56:26.919
It's time to get out
of your doggone house

56:27.051 --> 56:29.963
and start to make a difference,
each one, everyone.

56:30.471 --> 56:32.928
Elizabeth Willis, Fox 8 News.

56:33.057 --> 56:36.595
We are listening to speakers
outside of City Hall

56:36.727 --> 56:39.969
who are saying this is not
just a job for the police.

56:40.106 --> 56:43.394
— It's a job for all of us.
— (Man) If we don't give music excuse...

56:43.526 --> 56:46.142
And first of all, people,
stop having this mentality

56:46.279 --> 56:48.361
where nobody can tell your child nothing.

56:48.489 --> 56:50.195
(Cheering)

56:50.324 --> 56:53.236
If nobody can tell your child nothing,
then go back to Houston.

56:53.369 --> 56:56.611
I don't like Houston anyway.
I love New Orleans.

56:57.623 --> 57:00.160
I don't like Atlanta.
I love New Orleans.
