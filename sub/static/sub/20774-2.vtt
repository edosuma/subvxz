26:31.798 --> 26:34.801
And by the way, Kevin,
this is all your choice, you know?

26:34.884 --> 26:37.846
If you weren't here,
I can try to make that work,

26:37.929 --> 26:39.764
but if you were here...

26:40.849 --> 26:42.350
I could turn you into a hero.

26:44.185 --> 26:45.020
Okay, yeah.

26:45.103 --> 26:47.147
Right? You tried to save Marco's life.

26:47.230 --> 26:48.064
Great.

26:48.148 --> 26:51.568
I mean, we got Marco's gun here.

26:51.651 --> 26:52.485
[Kevin] Right.

26:53.778 --> 26:54.738
[man] And, uh...

26:57.574 --> 26:59.618
-we got you standing there.
-Right.

27:00.702 --> 27:04.289
And then Eric sees you entering
the house, he raises the gun.

27:05.081 --> 27:06.416
Yeah, maybe...

27:08.752 --> 27:10.045
Oh, yeah. That's good, yeah.

27:10.128 --> 27:10.962
What?

27:11.046 --> 27:12.380
That'll sell it, man.

27:13.048 --> 27:15.008
Prove there was another person
in the room.

27:15.592 --> 27:17.969
How does him picking up the gun
prove he's here?

27:18.636 --> 27:19.846
Because he shot you.

27:20.430 --> 27:22.974
And then you call 911, and you report it.

27:23.058 --> 27:24.434
No fucking way.

27:24.976 --> 27:26.853
Stand still and let's finish this.

27:26.936 --> 27:29.105
We're gonna wait here
till my brother gets here.

27:29.189 --> 27:31.274
Listen, do not fucking shoot me.

27:44.412 --> 27:46.122
[woman] My gas.

27:46.206 --> 27:47.916
Jesus fucking Christ.

27:48.500 --> 27:49.709
Hi, Mom. [cracks knuckles]

27:50.293 --> 27:52.128
-My gas.
-What?

27:52.712 --> 27:53.546
It's--

27:53.838 --> 27:54.714
You got gas?

27:54.798 --> 27:56.132
My gas.

27:56.674 --> 27:58.426
Your gas is out. Okay.

27:58.843 --> 28:00.720
We got a tank. We got a spare tank.

28:00.804 --> 28:01.971
Empty.

28:02.555 --> 28:05.141
It's empty? Why the fuck is it empty, Ma?

28:06.017 --> 28:07.560
Chelsea's supposed
to bring you fresh ones.

28:07.644 --> 28:09.145
It's not supposed to be empty.

28:10.230 --> 28:12.899
Where am I supposed to get one
in the middle of the night?

28:13.483 --> 28:14.442
Hospital.

28:15.360 --> 28:16.903
Okay. Call Chelsea.

28:16.986 --> 28:18.780
She isn't picking up.

28:19.197 --> 28:20.615
You need to go.

28:21.116 --> 28:22.534
-Hospital.
-Ma, I...

28:24.035 --> 28:27.497
I love you. I can't fucking deal
with this right now, okay?

28:27.580 --> 28:30.625
You gotta hold this thing
in your nose, put your hand up there.

28:30.708 --> 28:33.628
It'll be okay, okay?
This is not my fault, okay?

28:33.711 --> 28:36.965
You're gonna keep calling Chelsea.
It's gonna be good, okay?

28:37.632 --> 28:39.217
Just keep calling her, okay?

28:42.387 --> 28:44.097
You little cunt.

28:54.524 --> 28:55.567
I heard that, Mom.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.158
[indistinct radio chatter]

29:32.020 --> 29:33.188
[groans]

29:52.624 --> 29:54.000
[phone dialing]

29:55.460 --> 29:57.295
Come on, answer, you fucking fuckwad.

29:58.087 --> 29:58.922
[line beeps]

29:59.005 --> 30:01.800
Ozzy, I got your fucking payday
for you, dude.

30:01.883 --> 30:03.510
I got John Rayburn served up to you

30:03.593 --> 30:06.304
like a pig
on a fucking silver fucking stick.

30:06.763 --> 30:08.973
He's done some seriously bad fucking shit,

30:09.057 --> 30:11.392
and he's not gonna get away with it
if we act fast.

30:11.476 --> 30:12.977
So, you gotta fucking call me.

30:13.561 --> 30:14.479
So, fucking call me.

30:16.022 --> 30:17.607
[dance music playing over speakers]

30:23.738 --> 30:24.739
Hey, that, um--?

30:25.156 --> 30:26.741
That polar freeze?

30:27.325 --> 30:29.494
Is that the one
that turns your tongue all blue?

30:30.119 --> 30:31.621
Wha...

30:31.704 --> 30:32.539
What was that?

30:34.499 --> 30:35.333
Yeah, probably.

30:39.254 --> 30:41.422
Okay, good. I'll have one.

30:42.173 --> 30:43.007
What size?

30:44.926 --> 30:45.760
Um...

30:46.845 --> 30:47.679
large.

30:55.895 --> 30:57.230
-Okay, Kevin--
-You know what?

30:57.313 --> 30:59.899
Fuck this, man. This is crazy, okay?

30:59.983 --> 31:00.900
I'm done here.

31:00.984 --> 31:04.529
I'm gonna go back home, get John,
then we'll come back here. You got it?

31:04.612 --> 31:08.616
Kevin, if you move, I can't guarantee
where the bullet will strike.

31:09.075 --> 31:10.201
So, just stand still.

31:10.285 --> 31:12.412
All right? Don't move.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.747
-Fuck you. I'm out of here.
-Don't move.

31:18.084 --> 31:19.711
Fuck. Shit.

31:20.253 --> 31:21.963
-Ow.
-Fuck.

31:22.046 --> 31:23.673
I told you to stand still.

31:24.090 --> 31:27.427
You-- You fucking shot me, you bitch!

31:27.510 --> 31:28.803
You fucking shot me!

31:28.887 --> 31:29.971
No, I didn't.

31:30.054 --> 31:31.598
Listen to me. Listen to me, okay?

31:31.681 --> 31:34.726
We don't have a lot of time.
I didn't shoot you. You understand?

31:35.310 --> 31:37.770
-Get an ambulance.
-Eric O'Bannon shot you

31:37.854 --> 31:40.607
after you heard yelling,
after you surprised him

31:40.690 --> 31:42.734
and saw that he killed Detective Diaz.

31:42.817 --> 31:44.027
What the fuck, man?

31:44.110 --> 31:45.278
Okay, Kevin?

31:45.361 --> 31:48.031
Listen, man.
Kevin, Kevin, stay with me, okay?

31:48.114 --> 31:51.034
I need you to call 911 and report this.
Where's your phone?

31:51.117 --> 31:52.285
I can't. I can't.

31:52.368 --> 31:53.578
Okay, all right.

31:53.661 --> 31:55.622
-I don't feel my legs.
-Stay, stay with me.

31:55.705 --> 31:56.664
Okay, now, listen.

31:56.748 --> 32:00.627
I need you to dial and call 911 now.

32:01.669 --> 32:04.088
-I don't feel--
-I'm not fucking around, Kevin, okay?

32:04.172 --> 32:07.717
I need you to dial 911 now, okay?

32:08.593 --> 32:09.677
[man sighs]

32:10.595 --> 32:11.471
Oh, fuck.

32:13.806 --> 32:15.141
[keypad beeping, then dialing]

32:25.068 --> 32:26.653
911. What's your emergency?

32:27.487 --> 32:29.322
-Answer her.
-911. What's your emergency?

32:29.405 --> 32:32.742
-Answer her. Tell her where you are.
-If you need the police, press one.

32:33.493 --> 32:35.870
If you need the fire department,
press two.

32:36.454 --> 32:38.498
If you need an ambulance, press three.

32:39.749 --> 32:42.627
Is there someone there with you
who can give me an address?

32:45.755 --> 32:46.923
I just heard shots fired.

32:48.383 --> 32:49.425
Hello?

32:49.509 --> 32:51.678
If you can hear me, just stay on the line.

33:08.611 --> 33:10.321
[cell phone dialing]

33:14.033 --> 33:16.119
[woman over phone]
911. What's your emergency?

33:16.202 --> 33:18.705
[man] I just heard shots.
A few shots at my neighbor's house.

33:19.205 --> 33:20.748
Can you give me the address, sir?

33:20.832 --> 33:23.001
It's a cop's house. Diaz. Marco Diaz.

33:25.086 --> 33:27.005
The police department is on the way, sir.

33:27.088 --> 33:30.591
Stay in your house and lock your doors
and windows. They'll be there soon.

33:36.264 --> 33:37.682
[police sirens wailing]

34:26.773 --> 34:28.441
We got a male vic, he's clear.

34:29.025 --> 34:29.984
Come on, let's move.

34:31.652 --> 34:32.695
We got a faint pulse.

34:36.908 --> 34:38.076
[man 1] Bullet's still lodged.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.828
Sir? Sir, can you hear me?

34:41.329 --> 34:42.497
Please respond to me.

34:43.206 --> 34:44.624
[cell phone ringing]

34:49.003 --> 34:49.837
Rayburn.

34:58.096 --> 34:59.388
What was that address again?

35:02.308 --> 35:03.351
[man] How's the BP?

35:04.060 --> 35:05.144
[woman] It's dropping fast.

35:05.228 --> 35:06.312
[EKG beeping]

35:07.021 --> 35:08.231
[man] Push more fluids.

35:10.191 --> 35:11.651
[woman] We gotta stop the bleeding...

35:14.153 --> 35:16.864
-Keep pressure on the arm.
-[man] Pulse ox is fading.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.074
[EKG beeping rapidly]

35:20.118 --> 35:21.160
[John] Take a left up here.

35:30.545 --> 35:31.879
[rock music playing over speakers]

35:33.047 --> 35:35.007
Oh, what the fuck? Fuck.

35:58.656 --> 35:59.740
[Carol] John.

36:00.366 --> 36:03.703
One victim deceased, Detective Diaz,
and one shot is your brother.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.332
What the fuck are you talking about,
my brother?

36:09.083 --> 36:11.335
-You didn't know?
-No. Dispatch said that Marco--

36:11.711 --> 36:14.338
-The fuck are you talking about?
-Jesus, John. I'm sorry.

36:15.631 --> 36:16.465
Marco sho--

36:18.676 --> 36:19.844
Looks like he was beaten.

36:21.929 --> 36:24.182
Blunt force head trauma.
It's a fucking mess.

36:26.767 --> 36:28.561
Kevin is on his way to Island Village.

36:28.644 --> 36:31.272
He took two rounds.
One in the leg, one in the stomach.

36:39.614 --> 36:40.781
Did he say anything?

36:40.865 --> 36:42.033
No. No, no.

36:42.742 --> 36:44.994
He was unconscious when the unis arrived.

36:45.077 --> 36:47.330
John, go be with your brother.

36:47.747 --> 36:49.290
We'll handle things here.

36:49.999 --> 36:51.042
I ju-- I...

36:53.294 --> 36:54.754
-Suspects?
-[Carol] None.

36:55.713 --> 36:57.256
We gotta start working the scene.

37:00.635 --> 37:01.469
[softly] Kevin.

37:07.850 --> 37:08.976
Hey, hey, hey.

37:10.561 --> 37:11.896
We're in this together, John.

37:13.314 --> 37:14.607
We'll get the motherfucker.

37:47.098 --> 37:48.599
[inhales]

38:03.155 --> 38:03.990
Fuck.

38:06.742 --> 38:07.743
[Kevin] It's Marco, John.

38:08.995 --> 38:09.870
Marco's dead.

38:12.832 --> 38:18.796
I didn't have an option. We got into it,
and now he's just laying there.

38:19.338 --> 38:22.174
And now, Roy Gilbert's guy is waiting
for me over at Marco's,

38:22.258 --> 38:23.801
but I don't fucking know.

38:24.969 --> 38:26.929
[John] Kevin, what the fuck
are you talking about?

38:27.013 --> 38:28.431
[Kevin] Gilbert. Roy Gilbert.

38:32.018 --> 38:34.937
[John] Listen to me. You stay
right where you are. You hear me?

38:35.021 --> 38:37.231
I don't want you to talk to anyone,
I don't want you to do anything,

38:37.315 --> 38:41.068
I don't want you to agree to anything,
you stay right where you are.

38:42.028 --> 38:44.030
[Kevin] It's not my fucking fault, okay?

38:44.113 --> 38:46.032
This shit never would've happened, man,

38:46.115 --> 38:49.660
it never would've happened
if you didn't do what you fucking did.

39:00.421 --> 39:01.922
[chattering]

39:11.182 --> 39:12.224
Hey, um...

39:12.975 --> 39:15.978
Neighbor over there is the one
that called after hearing shots.

39:16.937 --> 39:20.066
Your brother called 911,
but he was unable to give an address.

39:20.274 --> 39:21.609
Neighbor didn't see anything.

39:22.234 --> 39:23.861
We're going door to door right now.

39:23.944 --> 39:25.654
Yeah. I already set up a perimeter.

39:26.405 --> 39:29.367
Any other angles?
Cases you guys were working on together?

39:29.867 --> 39:30.701
No.

39:31.911 --> 39:33.621
[Carol] Anyone getting out of prison?
Guys--

39:33.704 --> 39:35.039
Fuck, Carol, I don't know.

39:35.581 --> 39:37.708
[Aguirre] I gotta say it
'cause I'm thinking it, okay?

39:39.335 --> 39:40.669
Diana and the kids okay?

39:41.545 --> 39:42.380
They're safe?

39:45.216 --> 39:47.134
Yeah, they're at home in bed asleep. Why?

39:47.259 --> 39:48.844
I already dispatched a patrol.

39:49.845 --> 39:52.223
'Cause whoever did this
could be targeting you, too.

39:57.561 --> 39:58.396
Thank you.

40:00.356 --> 40:02.066
His, uh, next of kin?

40:04.485 --> 40:05.528
I'll do it.

40:05.611 --> 40:06.737
[cell phone buzzing]

40:08.364 --> 40:09.198
Excuse me.

40:12.076 --> 40:13.619
[Carol] Anything else I can do for you?

40:15.746 --> 40:16.747
I need your car.

40:18.916 --> 40:21.460
Sure. Keys are in it.

40:26.132 --> 40:27.007
Got anything?

40:27.091 --> 40:30.719
[man] Yeah. I got the, uh, time of death
between 60 and 90 minutes ago.

40:32.388 --> 40:33.597
Hey, John.

40:35.558 --> 40:38.102
I'm sorry about your baby brother.
I hope he's okay.

40:49.321 --> 40:50.656
[phone dialing]

40:55.661 --> 40:57.329
-[woman over phone] Hello?
-Knock, knock.

40:57.872 --> 40:59.165
I'm not in the mood.

40:59.248 --> 41:00.541
Oh, come on.

41:01.041 --> 41:03.836
-Who's there?
-Ozzy, what do you need?

41:04.253 --> 41:05.713
Well, for starters...

41:06.505 --> 41:07.381
[sniffs]

41:07.465 --> 41:09.842
I need a goddamn shower.
That's for damn sure.

41:11.552 --> 41:13.512
-Still in Miami, right?
-Yeah.

41:14.972 --> 41:16.348
-I'll see you soon.
-All right.

41:21.896 --> 41:22.771
[knocking on door]

41:26.484 --> 41:27.359
[knocking on door]

41:31.822 --> 41:32.698
[knocking on door]

41:53.302 --> 41:54.386
Is John okay?

41:57.014 --> 41:58.641
[woman]
The doctor will be right with you.

42:00.100 --> 42:03.437
Excuse me, I was promised an update
from Dr. Vasson.

42:03.521 --> 42:05.064
Could you please contact him?

42:05.147 --> 42:06.023
He's in surgery.

42:06.732 --> 42:07.816
[Diana] Belle.

42:09.193 --> 42:11.237
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

42:11.320 --> 42:12.154
[crying]

42:12.238 --> 42:13.113
Kev--

42:13.197 --> 42:16.033
John sent an officer to get me.
What's the status on Kevin?

42:16.116 --> 42:18.869
They won't tell me. They--
No one's telling me anything.

42:18.953 --> 42:22.498
He's in surgery,
and they said that he was at Marco's.

42:22.581 --> 42:24.083
-He's what?
-I don't know.

42:25.668 --> 42:26.961
I don't know. He...

42:28.087 --> 42:30.005
Where's Meg? Has anyone seen her or John?

42:30.089 --> 42:31.549
-I don't know.
-Okay.

42:31.632 --> 42:32.675
-Okay, I got it.
-[John] Hi.

42:37.012 --> 42:38.097
Is he out of surgery yet?

42:38.180 --> 42:40.224
-They won't tell me anything.
-[woman] Belle Rayburn?

42:41.934 --> 42:45.563
Dr. Vasson wanted to tell you your husband
made it through his first surgery.

42:45.646 --> 42:48.107
They've stopped the bleeding
from one of the wounds,

42:48.190 --> 42:50.317
and they're working on the second one now.

42:50.985 --> 42:55.072
It'd be helpful to know if any of you have
Kevin's blood type to donate just in case.

42:56.574 --> 42:59.410
I think Meg does.
But he should really be in Miami.

42:59.493 --> 43:02.246
When he gets out of surgery,
give me a call, I'll come back.

43:02.329 --> 43:04.665
-Miami Baptist has the best doctor--
-Who did this?

43:04.748 --> 43:07.209
-I don't know.
-You find out who did this.

43:07.293 --> 43:10.004
-Could you have him transferred to Miami?
-Yes, yes.

43:10.087 --> 43:12.673
-That's exactly what I'm gonna try to do.
-[Belle] You find out.

43:13.257 --> 43:14.425
Oh, my God.

43:24.393 --> 43:25.728

43:59.511 --> 44:02.514
whatever happened, you better pray
my son is gonna be all right.

44:02.598 --> 44:04.767
And fucking call me back, Roy.

44:16.862 --> 44:17.696
Hey.

44:23.702 --> 44:24.536

44:29.083 --> 44:29.917
[Meg] John?

44:33.837 --> 44:35.172
John, is that you?

44:36.423 --> 44:37.257
Yeah.

44:40.719 --> 44:44.598
Have you seen Kevin?
I called you a million times.

44:47.768 --> 44:50.396
You need to come with me to the hospital
and give blood.

44:51.146 --> 44:52.231
Kevin's been shot.

44:54.483 --> 44:55.317
You hear me?

44:56.693 --> 45:00.197
[Meg] Kevin is at Marco's, you know?

45:00.781 --> 45:03.617
I gotta go to work in the morning, okay?

45:04.993 --> 45:06.203

Aren't you a sight for sore eyes?

45:37.234 --> 45:38.485
Holy shit.

45:39.653 --> 45:41.613
Yeah, well, you should see the other guys.

45:43.991 --> 45:45.742
Don't fucking sit on my couch.

45:47.578 --> 45:48.954
No, I don't need a doctor.

45:49.621 --> 45:52.666
I have no idea where Roy Gilbert is.
He's not answering my calls.

45:52.749 --> 45:56.628
I only have his cell phone number.
You don't have any other contact for him?

45:56.712 --> 45:59.006
I called his home.
He's probably long gone by now,

45:59.089 --> 46:01.341
on his boat or his plane,
or however he does it.

46:02.092 --> 46:04.178
Vanishing is his best talent.

46:04.970 --> 46:07.222
Where's Meg?
She's not answering my calls either.

46:07.306 --> 46:10.142
-God, she's useless.
-If you're dizzy, why don't you sit down?

46:11.393 --> 46:13.645
Place your head
between your knees and sit down.

46:13.729 --> 46:16.565
Would you just stop ordering me around?

46:17.149 --> 46:17.983
I just need water.

46:18.066 --> 46:21.153
You want me to get you a glass of water,
I'll get you water.

If you have tightness in your chest...

46:34.082 --> 46:35.417
we need to call the doctor.

46:46.803 --> 46:47.971
I know everything, John.

46:51.350 --> 46:52.518
Meg told me all of it.

46:55.103 --> 46:58.482
And I don't wanna hear you making excuses
for why you did what you did.

46:58.565 --> 47:00.317
I don't want you apologizing to me,

47:00.400 --> 47:02.819
or asking me to forgive you
for anything you've done.

47:02.903 --> 47:06.281
I just want you to do one thing...
and one thing only.

47:06.365 --> 47:09.076
I want you to find who shot your brother.

47:28.136 --> 47:30.556
When you went to Roy Gilbert,
what did he say to you?

47:31.557 --> 47:32.641
He said, uh...

47:34.476 --> 47:36.562
he had a guy who could help Kevin.

47:38.897 --> 47:40.941
They'd work together and, uh...

47:42.526 --> 47:45.529
figure out who... else to blame.

47:46.822 --> 47:49.825
What else did he say about the guy?
Did he mention anything else?

47:50.409 --> 47:52.869
No, he said the less I knew the better.

47:52.953 --> 47:56.290
But he'd get Kevin out from under this.

47:58.417 --> 47:59.751
To frame someone else.

48:00.294 --> 48:01.169
Oh.

48:01.712 --> 48:03.046
That's the word.

48:03.130 --> 48:03.964

There are gonna be a lot of questions
coming at you.

49:22.501 --> 49:24.419
And you're gonna say, "I don't remember."

49:26.713 --> 49:27.756
Do you understand that?

49:28.173 --> 49:29.883
You're gonna say, "I don't remember."

49:35.347 --> 49:38.600
You're gonna give me a chance
to try to figure something out for you.

49:40.185 --> 49:41.395
[knocking on door]

49:56.576 --> 49:57.411

In and out.

50:05.377 --> 50:06.211
Well...

50:06.795 --> 50:08.296

50:10.257 --> 50:11.091
Yeah.

50:11.925 --> 50:15.095
The doc also said when Kevin
was coming out of anesthesia...

50:16.179 --> 50:17.305
he ID'd the shooter.

50:19.558 --> 50:20.392

We're ready for you, Detective Rayburn.

50:31.778 --> 50:33.155
Go ahead. We'll talk later.

50:35.449 --> 50:36.366
Yeah.

51:15.947 --> 51:17.783
You're stronger than you think.

51:22.037 --> 51:24.956
You're stronger than your family thinks.

51:32.214 --> 51:33.548
We're gonna get through this.

51:37.219 --> 51:38.678
And we're gonna have our baby.

51:43.016 --> 51:44.226
And we're gonna love him.

51:46.144 --> 51:47.604
And we're gonna keep him safe.

51:53.151 --> 51:54.986
And you're gonna watch him grow up.

I love you.

I love you.
