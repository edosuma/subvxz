WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:04.536
As a rule, I don't talk
about your insane business
ideas before breakfast.

00:04.538 --> 00:07.006
Fine, we'll eat
breakfast and then
I'll pitch it to you.

00:07.008 --> 00:09.441
Yeah, but then
technically it'll be
before breakfast tomorrow.

00:09.443 --> 00:12.077
I don't really see
a way out of this.

00:12.079 --> 00:16.015
I'm telling you,
charlie, no one's ever done
a food truck like this.

00:16.017 --> 00:18.784
All we're gonna serve
is turkey, cranberry sauce,

00:18.786 --> 00:21.020
Mashed potatoes
and stuffing.

00:21.022 --> 00:23.422
It's thanksgiving
all year long.

00:23.424 --> 00:25.691
That's great.
You should also hire
some family members

00:25.693 --> 00:28.594
To sit around the truck
and argue about things that
happened 20 years ago.

00:28.596 --> 00:30.295
And I have a gimmick.

00:30.297 --> 00:32.297
Whatever you don't finish,
you give back to us

00:32.299 --> 00:35.601
And we serve it to you
for free the next day
as leftovers.

00:35.603 --> 00:37.770
If you can find the truck.

00:37.772 --> 00:40.672
If you can find the truck.

00:40.674 --> 00:43.375
Hey, I'm going down
to get a paper.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.277
I love the obituaries
in los angeles.

00:45.279 --> 00:46.545
Everybody's famous here.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.814
Last week a sound technician
from "forrest gump"

00:48.816 --> 00:50.349
Dropped dead on the crapper.

00:50.351 --> 00:53.085
Yup, nothing
but glitz and glamour.

00:53.087 --> 00:54.486
I'll be back in five.

00:54.488 --> 00:56.255
Two eggs over easy,
bacon crispy.

00:56.257 --> 00:58.824
You know how I like it.
Chop, chop.

01:00.794 --> 01:04.396
Do you think rat poison would
change the flavor of eggs?

01:04.398 --> 01:05.831
Why are you
so impatient with him?

01:05.833 --> 01:07.833
He's been here three days.

01:07.835 --> 01:09.768
Well, he's scared.
There was a robbery

01:09.770 --> 01:12.438
Down the block
from his complex.
He doesn't want to be alone.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.173
Yeah, there's a huge
market out there right now

01:14.175 --> 01:17.142
For pill organizers
and pit-stained undershirts.

01:17.144 --> 01:19.078
I've got to get him
out of here. I was thinking
about buying him a gun.

01:19.080 --> 01:21.613
Oh, no, charlie.
One out of four
shooting victims

01:21.615 --> 01:26.151
Oh, well, then I'll
get three more just to be
on the safe side.

01:29.122 --> 01:32.291
So, nolan, at the last
session we talked about how
you don't socialize enough.

01:32.293 --> 01:33.625
That's crazy.

01:33.627 --> 01:35.727
You mean socialize to
go out and meet people?

01:35.729 --> 01:38.797
- Exactly.
- Oh, yeah, I don't do that.

01:38.799 --> 01:41.166
Would somebody mind
taking nolan out tonight?

01:41.168 --> 01:43.735
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Dibs on not doing it.

01:43.737 --> 01:45.671
Okay, I've got
to respect dibs.

01:45.673 --> 01:50.809
I think it'll help to have
somebody else ease nolan
into a social situation.

01:50.811 --> 01:53.312
Fine, but only
for like an hour.

01:53.314 --> 01:56.615
I have a horrible person
staying in my home who
I do not trust.

01:56.617 --> 01:57.850
You don't trust me?

01:57.852 --> 02:00.252
You're the one that told
me I won the lottery.

02:00.254 --> 02:03.622
Do you think I like staying
at the courtyard fairyott?

02:05.625 --> 02:07.426
Golly, if you two
kids can't make it,

02:07.428 --> 02:09.261
I don't know what chance
there is for the rest of us.

02:10.563 --> 02:14.299
It's not me.
Every night I can't sleep

02:14.301 --> 02:16.869
Because I'm listening to
this guy get ready for bed.

02:16.871 --> 02:19.638
Who in the hell
dries his hair at night?

02:19.640 --> 02:23.475
People with,
you know, hair.

02:24.744 --> 02:27.913
I'd have hair if I used
rogaine like he does.

02:27.915 --> 02:29.915
( laughing )

02:29.917 --> 02:32.417
Rogaine?
I don't--

02:32.419 --> 02:34.887
Why would--
you stay out of
my medicine cabinet.

02:36.189 --> 02:38.757
I just needed to borrow
your deodorant.

02:38.759 --> 02:41.293
Oh, my god.

02:41.295 --> 02:44.763
You see why
I'm afraid to leave him
alone in my house?

02:44.765 --> 02:46.365
You've got nothing
to worry about.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.167
I already found
your diary.

02:48.169 --> 02:50.869
- What?
- Oh, good, he's got
a diary.

02:50.871 --> 02:53.505
Okay, guys,
we're out of time.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.307
Patrick, treat ed
like a guest.

02:55.309 --> 02:56.909
Ed, keep his stuff
out of your armpits.

02:56.911 --> 02:58.777
See you all Thursday.

02:58.779 --> 03:01.180
Ed, can I talk to you
for a second?

03:02.749 --> 03:06.318
I'm a little concerned
that you and patrick are
gonna murder each other.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.953
I hope half
of that happens.

03:09.522 --> 03:10.889
I don't.

03:10.891 --> 03:13.292
I think I might have
a better roommate for you.

03:13.294 --> 03:15.227
How would you feel about
living with my dad?

03:15.229 --> 03:17.763
Well, hell, charlie,
I barely know the man.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.498
Perfect.
That's one of his
best features.

03:21.234 --> 03:22.734
Lacey, you've got
to help me.

03:22.736 --> 03:25.771
I am too preoccupied
to take nolan out tonight.

03:25.773 --> 03:28.807
I'm dealing with
this hillbilly ghost
haunting my apartment.

03:28.809 --> 03:31.543
He's just not dead yet.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.979
Yeah, sucks to be you.
Bye.

03:33.981 --> 03:36.648
Wait.
I know you called dibs,

03:36.650 --> 03:38.884
But if you take nolan
off my hands tonight,

03:38.886 --> 03:40.586
- I'll give you $20.
- ( scoffs )

03:40.588 --> 03:42.588
I wouldn't do it
for 20 million billion.

03:42.590 --> 03:46.225
How about 40 and I don't tell
charlie you dented his car?

03:46.227 --> 03:48.794
- You did that!
- I'm that desperate.

03:56.236 --> 03:59.605
Sorry I took so long.
The cafeteria was packed.

03:59.607 --> 04:01.273
When did this other
couple get here?

04:01.275 --> 04:03.609
It's the same couple.
They're still going at it.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.244
<i>( alarm beeps )</i>

04:05.246 --> 04:07.346
And she just had
another orgasm.

04:07.348 --> 04:10.349
Weird.
She's barely moving.

04:10.351 --> 04:12.017
How many is that?
Nine?

04:12.019 --> 04:13.685
Try 15.

04:13.687 --> 04:16.288
Mm, I'd like to.

04:16.290 --> 04:18.857
Should we stop them?
It's getting late.

04:18.859 --> 04:21.793
We can't stop them.
We're conducting
professional research.

04:21.795 --> 04:25.264
What we can do is turn
it into a drinking game.

04:25.266 --> 04:27.966
Good idea.

04:27.968 --> 04:31.536
Every time she has
a confirmed orgasm,

04:31.538 --> 04:33.538
We take a shot.

04:35.642 --> 04:37.909
- <i>( alarm beeps )</i>
<i>- and she's off.</i>

04:40.280 --> 04:42.681
I hope you didn't make
any plans tonight.

04:42.683 --> 04:45.550
No, I'm happy to say
that I'll be going home
to an empty house.

04:45.552 --> 04:47.819
I finally got my dad
to go back to his place.

04:47.821 --> 04:51.857
He was, but then I convinced
ed to move in with him.

04:51.859 --> 04:53.859
- <i>( alarm beeps )</i>
<i>- wow.</i>

04:53.861 --> 04:56.595
I know.

04:58.064 --> 05:00.332
Wait, how'd you do that?
They barely know each other.

05:00.334 --> 05:02.501
Well, I told my dad
that he and ed had
a lot in common.

05:02.503 --> 05:04.369
- That they're
both, you know--
- old?

05:04.371 --> 05:05.704
- Yeah, and--
- horrible people?

05:05.706 --> 05:07.739
Exactly.

05:07.741 --> 05:10.008
<i>( alarm beeps )</i>

05:12.512 --> 05:13.979
What's his secret?

05:13.981 --> 05:16.348
I think it's all her.

05:16.350 --> 05:18.417
Hitting a pothole
would get this woman off.

05:18.419 --> 05:21.453
Don't you realize that
having one of your patients

05:21.455 --> 05:23.388
Move in with your dad
is a recipe for disaster?

05:23.390 --> 05:26.091
No, but what
I did realize...

05:27.560 --> 05:29.728
The beeping is coming
from the printer.

05:32.031 --> 05:33.665
That woman's not having
an orgasm.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.634
She's out of paper.

05:37.503 --> 05:39.871
All I'm saying
is that she may be

05:39.873 --> 05:42.774
This country's greatest
living american.

05:42.776 --> 05:45.644
( sighs )
all right, ed,
I'll bite.

05:45.646 --> 05:47.813
How is dolly parton

05:47.815 --> 05:50.415
Our county's greatest
living american?

05:50.417 --> 05:53.118
- Two reasons.
- Oh, come on.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.387
No, no, it's not
what you think.

05:55.389 --> 05:57.422
Her songwriting abilities

05:57.424 --> 06:00.592
And her boobs.

06:00.594 --> 06:02.661
Oh, please.

06:03.629 --> 06:05.130
- ( tires squeal )
- oh, no!

06:10.570 --> 06:13.438
I hope to god
that was the same woman.

06:14.841 --> 06:16.908
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

06:20.613 --> 06:23.148
She just came out of nowhere
right in front of the car.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.983
Don't worry
about the woman.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.985
The hospital said
she'd be fine.

06:26.987 --> 06:29.421
What you ought to worry
about is the lawsuit

06:29.423 --> 06:32.824
Because she's gonna sue you
for every last penny you've got.

06:32.826 --> 06:33.992
Why should I be
worried about that?

06:33.994 --> 06:35.660
That's why I have
insurance.

06:35.662 --> 06:36.828
Insurance?
( laughs )

06:36.830 --> 06:39.131
That's good.
You got an umbrella?

06:39.133 --> 06:41.133
Because there's
a tsunami coming

06:41.135 --> 06:44.836
And it speaks jew
and it knows the law.

06:44.838 --> 06:48.006
Now I'm really terrified.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.841
What, that they're gonna
take all your money?

06:49.843 --> 06:52.711
No, that I'm living
with you.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.980
Look, the woman's
gonna be all right.

06:54.982 --> 06:56.982
But her lawyers
ain't done yet.

06:56.984 --> 06:58.483
If you got
anything saved up,

06:58.485 --> 07:00.452
You better put it in a box
and bury it.

07:00.454 --> 07:02.587
I do have a little
something put aside.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.890
Well, then hide it, man.

07:04.892 --> 07:08.960
Look, a friend of mine did
that when he was being sued.

07:08.962 --> 07:11.129
He passed his money
over to a buddy.

07:11.131 --> 07:12.998
And after
everything blew over,

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
The guy gave it
all back to him.

07:15.002 --> 07:17.669
Well, almost all.

07:17.671 --> 07:19.871
I kept a few bucks
for a down payment

07:19.873 --> 07:22.107
On a dodge dart.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.443
But I can't hide
the money with a friend

07:24.445 --> 07:26.011
Because if anyone found out,
then that friend

07:26.013 --> 07:28.013
Would be an accessory
to a crime, right?

07:28.015 --> 07:29.815
Mm-hmm.
So what are you gonna do?

07:29.817 --> 07:31.950
I'll give it
to the family.

07:33.619 --> 07:35.053
<i>( music playing )</i>

07:35.055 --> 07:36.755
Okay, I was supposed to get
you out of your house.

07:36.757 --> 07:40.158
- You're out of your house.
- This is fun.

07:40.160 --> 07:44.062
I told you not
to talk to me unless
it's something important.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.898
Ugh, crap.
My sister's here.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.034
She's such
an annoying bitch.

07:49.036 --> 07:52.070
Hey, girl, hey.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.805
What up, girl?

07:54.907 --> 07:56.708
Oh, you look
so hot.

07:56.710 --> 07:59.644
Like you've been
throwing up just enough.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.246
Thanks.

08:01.248 --> 08:03.915
I can't wait to talk
to you when I'm more drunk.

08:03.917 --> 08:06.585
What's up with joe dirt?

08:06.587 --> 08:09.988
Hey, sateen.
Remember me?
Nolan from group.

08:09.990 --> 08:13.225
Oh, I don't go
to aa anymore.
I'm cured.

08:15.194 --> 08:17.662
Oh, look,
there's someone else.

08:22.568 --> 08:26.671
So, are you and lacey...

08:26.673 --> 08:27.839
Are we what?

08:27.841 --> 08:30.675
I mean, you know.
Are you guys together?

08:30.677 --> 08:33.278
No, she just went
over there.

08:33.280 --> 08:37.282
( laughs )
you're stupid.

08:37.284 --> 08:40.986
Now seriously,
what's up with you
and my sister?

08:40.988 --> 08:43.221
My therapist asked
this guy to take me out

08:43.223 --> 08:45.857
And he sold me to lacey
for 40 bucks.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.593
So that means
my family owns you.

08:48.595 --> 08:51.196
Which means I can do
whatever I want with you.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.098
I guess, for tonight.

08:53.100 --> 08:56.234
I don't know
what my contract
says after that.

08:56.236 --> 08:58.703
I thought I saw
lebron james,

08:58.705 --> 09:00.839
But it was just this
other guy I already dated

09:00.841 --> 09:04.276
Because I thought
he was lebron james.

09:04.278 --> 09:06.545
Hey, your sister's
pretty cool.

09:06.547 --> 09:08.113
You're stupid.

09:08.115 --> 09:09.915
She said the same thing.

09:09.917 --> 09:12.651
Sisters.

09:16.623 --> 09:21.293
Maybe he dyed his hair
and we're gonna have to
tell him it looks good.

09:21.295 --> 09:24.162
Well, I'm gonna be honest,
unless it does look good,

09:24.164 --> 09:26.131
In which case I'll lie.

09:26.133 --> 09:28.800
Okay, maybe he's coming
over to tell us he's gay.

09:28.802 --> 09:30.735
Lori miller's grandpa
came out last week

09:30.737 --> 09:32.571
And it was really
exciting for everybody.

09:33.806 --> 09:36.575
Except for
lori miller's grandma.

09:36.577 --> 09:38.310
Hello, everybody.

09:38.312 --> 09:40.011
Jen:
Hi, martin.
How's it going?

09:40.013 --> 09:42.113
- Great.
- How are things working
out with you and ed?

09:42.115 --> 09:43.882
Ed?
Ed's a big sweetheart.

09:43.884 --> 09:46.718
- Oh, good.
- Sweetheart? I knew it.

09:48.154 --> 09:49.721
What the hell
is she talking about?

09:49.723 --> 09:51.856
It doesn't matter.
We'll never accept you.

09:51.858 --> 09:54.359
So what are we here for?

09:54.361 --> 09:56.261
Well, everybody,
please sit down.

09:59.665 --> 10:01.299
First of all,
I want you all to know

10:01.301 --> 10:02.901
That I love you all
very much.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.736
Come on, suicide.

10:04.738 --> 10:06.905
- And in life...
- Darn it.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.807
...You take care
of the people you love.

10:08.809 --> 10:12.077
Now, I don't want to die
an old man with a bag of money.

10:12.079 --> 10:13.912
So I've decided to share

10:13.914 --> 10:16.081
My life savings
with you three.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.883
I have cashier's checks
for each one of you

10:18.885 --> 10:20.785
For $35,000.

10:20.787 --> 10:23.021
- Are you serious?
- There you go.

10:23.023 --> 10:25.957
- Grandpa, thank you.
- You're welcome.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.660
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
$35,000?

10:28.662 --> 10:30.762
- For each of us?
- Mm-hmm.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.764
Where did you get...

10:32.766 --> 10:35.233
Three times $35,000?

10:35.235 --> 10:37.936
I put away a little bit
at a time

10:37.938 --> 10:39.971
And it eventually
worked up to be 100--

10:39.973 --> 10:43.141
- And $5,000!
- Yes.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.943
Why have I been supporting
you this whole time

10:44.945 --> 10:45.977
When you're sitting
on this kind of money?

10:45.979 --> 10:51.383
But I was also afraid
if you cut me off, I'd need
something to live on.

10:51.385 --> 10:54.219
So, there you have it.
Now look, don't spend it.

10:54.221 --> 10:56.888
Save it for
a rainy day, all right?

10:56.890 --> 11:00.792
Because you never know
when you or someone you
love might need it back.

11:00.794 --> 11:03.094
I mean, need it.
Why did I say back?

11:03.096 --> 11:06.131
So who'd like to go out
to dinner and celebrate?

11:06.133 --> 11:09.734
Dad, I don't know
what to say.

11:09.736 --> 11:12.671
How about before dinner
we make a toast to you?

11:12.673 --> 11:14.739
Jen, why don't you
help me get a bottle
of wine out of the kitchen?

11:14.741 --> 11:16.941
Sure.

11:18.811 --> 11:20.979
Dad, are you dying?

11:20.981 --> 11:23.048
I'm fit as a fiddle.

11:23.050 --> 11:25.684
Oh, we'll get
the wine anyway.

11:28.287 --> 11:30.388
This is so sweet
of your father.

11:30.390 --> 11:33.425
Sweet, my ass.
The man is up to something.

11:33.427 --> 11:37.295
I was always late for preschool
because of my second job.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.998
He's just getting older
and sentimental.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.301
He wants us to put it
in the bank so we have
more security.

11:43.303 --> 11:46.037
Ah, you're probably right.

11:46.039 --> 11:49.708
You know what we should do?
Spend it.

11:49.710 --> 11:52.043
Spend it fast,
spend it hard,
spend it long.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.712
This is my dad
we're talking about.

11:53.714 --> 11:54.879
We need to burn
through this cash

11:54.881 --> 11:56.981
Before he changes
his evil little mind.

11:56.983 --> 11:58.717
I'm buying a corvette.

11:58.719 --> 12:01.286
But, charlie, he said
to save it for a rainy day.

12:01.288 --> 12:05.256
Yeah?
Well, when that day comes,
I'll turn on the wipers.

12:07.493 --> 12:09.761
So, patrick,
I'm a little confused.
I thought I asked you

12:09.763 --> 12:11.129
To take nolan out
last night, not lacey.

12:11.131 --> 12:13.465
I know.
And I feel horrible.

12:13.467 --> 12:15.467
It's probably the biggest
mistake of my life.

12:15.469 --> 12:17.435
A simple "I don't care"
would have been sufficient.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.170
( laughs )
I don't care.

12:19.172 --> 12:21.740
So, nolan,
how was your evening?

12:21.742 --> 12:24.509
It would have been okay
if he hadn't spent all night

12:24.511 --> 12:27.145
Talking to my sister.
I hate her.

12:27.147 --> 12:30.348
When she was little,
she was always hanging
around our house.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.317
Yeah, that's
the problem with kids.

12:32.319 --> 12:35.987
They become entitled
and they think they're
part of the family.

12:35.989 --> 12:37.889
Lacey, I was asking nolan
about his evening.

12:37.891 --> 12:41.459
I know, and I'm telling
you it sucked for me.

12:41.461 --> 12:44.763
We're out of time,
so I'll see you all
next Thursday.

12:44.765 --> 12:48.066
So, ed, how are things
going living with my dad?

12:48.068 --> 12:50.101
Oh, it's fine.
He's a good man.

12:50.103 --> 12:53.138
Ed, what's--
what's going on with
that money he gave us?

12:53.140 --> 12:55.373
Oh, I don't know
nothing about that.

12:55.375 --> 12:58.109
Sometimes a gift
is just a gift.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.545
It's not like
he's hiding money
or nothing.

13:05.184 --> 13:08.319
Hiding money?
From who?

13:08.321 --> 13:10.822
Look, I've said enough.

13:10.824 --> 13:13.858
If you think
I'm gonna say any more,
you're sadly mistaken.

13:13.860 --> 13:16.961
I was a prisoner of war
in vietnam

13:16.963 --> 13:18.396
And your daddy's a veteran.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.999
I wouldn't sell him out
for anything.

13:21.001 --> 13:25.036
They just picked him up.
He's down there right now
saying it was all your idea.

13:25.038 --> 13:28.273
That son of a bitch.
What do you want to know?

13:28.275 --> 13:29.574
What's going on, ed?

13:29.576 --> 13:31.109
Well, I just told him

13:31.111 --> 13:33.511
To pass the money to
a friend, not a relative.

13:33.513 --> 13:36.181
I didn't want to make
you an accessory.

13:36.183 --> 13:38.583
Holy god, what the hell
did you guys do?

13:38.585 --> 13:42.353
It wasn't too bad.
We almost killed a woman.

13:43.956 --> 13:45.924
Your daddy hit her
with a car

13:45.926 --> 13:49.160
And he's trying
to hide the money
in case he gets sued.

13:49.162 --> 13:52.297
All you got to do is
just give it back to him.
You won't get in no trouble.

13:52.299 --> 13:54.532
Give it back?
What if I'd already spent it?

13:54.534 --> 13:56.367
Good thing I didn't.

13:56.369 --> 13:58.937
Oh, crap.
Jennifer.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.505
I told her to spend it.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.974
Do you want me to go bail
your daddy out of jail?

14:02.976 --> 14:05.410
He's not in jail, ed.
Police never called.
I was just bluffing.

14:05.412 --> 14:08.079
Oh, in that case,
would you mind

14:08.081 --> 14:11.082
Hitting me over the head
with one of these pool sticks?

14:11.084 --> 14:13.618
I don't want to look like
I rolled over too easy.

14:16.222 --> 14:18.223
( knocking )

14:20.459 --> 14:22.160
- Hey, charlie.
- Why don't you answer
your phone?

14:22.162 --> 14:24.162
- I've been calling
you for an hour.
- Oh, sorry.

14:24.164 --> 14:26.898
I think I left my phone
where I bought my new truck.

14:26.900 --> 14:29.167
You bought a new truck?
It's only been 10 hours.

14:29.169 --> 14:31.102
That's barely enough time
to look at a brochure.

14:31.104 --> 14:33.171
What's your problem?

14:33.173 --> 14:35.373
My dad gave us that money
to hide it from some lady
who's gonna sue him.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.108
If we don't give it back,
we're all gonna be in trouble.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.409
What'd you get,
a dodge, a ford?

14:38.411 --> 14:42.180
A thanksgiving food.

14:42.182 --> 14:44.282
You were serious
about that.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.184
It's a good business.

14:46.186 --> 14:48.052
I told you about
the leftovers, right?

14:49.622 --> 14:51.122
Okay, you know what?
It's still a vehicle,

14:51.124 --> 14:52.190
Which means we can
still take it back.

14:52.192 --> 14:53.558
I don't think so.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.227
Mr. Garcia--
very nice man,
by the way--

14:56.229 --> 14:58.363
He took the money
I gave him for the truck

14:58.365 --> 14:59.898
And went back
to guatemala.

14:59.900 --> 15:02.300
He's buying his daughter
back from a drug lord.

15:05.104 --> 15:08.239
I don't understand
why we're going out again
if nobody's paying you.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.541
The last time we were here,
all you did was ignore me.

15:10.543 --> 15:13.111
I know,
and I feel so bad.

15:13.113 --> 15:14.545
And I want to make it
up to you.

15:14.547 --> 15:16.281
The only reason
you're here

15:16.283 --> 15:19.050
Is so that you and I
can have a good time.

15:19.052 --> 15:20.518
Wow.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.587
You don't know how long
I've been waiting--

15:22.589 --> 15:26.057
Hey, sateen, look who
likes me better than you.

15:26.059 --> 15:28.393
Oh, god, is that
why you called?

15:28.395 --> 15:31.496
To make sure I was here?
You are so sad.

15:31.498 --> 15:35.133
And see-through.
Like saran sad.

15:35.135 --> 15:36.567
Hey, nolan.

15:36.569 --> 15:39.437
Once you're done
caring for my ancient
older sister,

15:39.439 --> 15:41.139
Why don't you
hang with me?

15:41.141 --> 15:43.041
Oh, no, no, no.

15:43.043 --> 15:45.276
This stops right now,
baby sister.

15:45.278 --> 15:48.012
Nolan, sweetheart,
darling, cookie face,

15:48.014 --> 15:50.081
Tell sesame
streetwalker here

15:50.083 --> 15:52.317
That you want to be
with me and not her.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.285
Is that true, nolan?

15:54.287 --> 15:57.155
After all that
time we spent in
the booth last night

15:57.157 --> 16:00.124
Yelling over the music
and nodding like we could
hear each other?

16:00.126 --> 16:02.460
I'm really sorry, sateen,

16:02.462 --> 16:05.363
And I'll never forget
everything I didn't
hear you say,

16:05.365 --> 16:07.699
But my heart belongs
to your sister.

16:07.701 --> 16:09.300
That's right.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.703
Now turn that ass
around right now

16:11.705 --> 16:14.372
Unless you want
another nose job.

16:14.374 --> 16:16.407
Fine.
Bye, bitch.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.242
Bye, hooker.

16:18.244 --> 16:20.378
Call you
tomorrow, baby girl.
Love you.

16:21.748 --> 16:27.085
You've got to see
this couple from yesterday
having tantric sex.

16:30.622 --> 16:33.024
Are they moving?

16:33.026 --> 16:35.760
Yes, just very slowly.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.996
How can there be a billion
people in india

16:37.998 --> 16:40.198
If it takes this long
to have sex?

16:40.200 --> 16:42.500
- I know, right?
- Whoa, you're in a hurry.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.535
My dad ran over
an old woman

16:44.537 --> 16:47.205
And my ex-wife is buying
a thanksgiving food truck.

16:47.207 --> 16:49.307
Mmm, not again.

16:49.309 --> 16:50.641
The woman is gonna be fine,

16:50.643 --> 16:52.577
But I'm afraid the family
is gonna sue,

16:52.579 --> 16:54.679
So I want to get over there
and try to come to some
reasonable settlement.

16:54.681 --> 16:57.482
- Oh, so you're
being proactive.
- Yes, I am.

16:57.484 --> 17:00.651
That's a terrible idea.

17:00.653 --> 17:03.388
Why? I want to try
to settle this before
the lawyers get involved.

17:03.390 --> 17:06.758
If I don't,
jen's gonna get dragged off
to jail in a turkey truck.

17:06.760 --> 17:09.327
So you're negotiating
out of fear.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.396
You're gonna go in there
like a little puppy dog,

17:11.398 --> 17:13.097
Hoping they like you
and listen to reason.

17:13.099 --> 17:14.732
What you really need
is a big tough dog

17:14.734 --> 17:17.435
Who'll go in there and bite
them before they bite you.

17:17.437 --> 17:19.470
Sure, but where am I
gonna get a big tough dog?

17:20.672 --> 17:22.440
Woof.

17:24.743 --> 17:26.444
Now remember,
you are the good cop

17:26.446 --> 17:28.813
And I am the bad cop.

17:28.815 --> 17:30.782
- <i>( knocks )</i>
<i>- remember we used</i>
<i>to play that game?</i>

17:30.784 --> 17:32.617
You'd dress up
in that little uniform

17:32.619 --> 17:36.220
And pat me down
looking for hidden weapons.

17:36.222 --> 17:39.257
You'd always find
the same one and pretend
to be surprised.

17:41.394 --> 17:45.596
- Hi, is this the home
of joyce lewis?
- Yes. I'm her son.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.799
I'm charlie goodson.
My father is martin goodson.

17:47.801 --> 17:51.102
And I'm his counsel
designated to negotiate
on his behalf.

17:51.104 --> 17:53.104
Hells, yeah, she is.

17:53.106 --> 17:56.474
Look, you can just
give us a bill to repair
the damages to your car.

17:56.476 --> 17:58.643
We just don't want you taking
us to court, that's all.

17:58.645 --> 18:01.846
- Excuse me?
- My mother suffers
from dementia.

18:01.848 --> 18:04.082
She probably jumped out
in front of your father's car.

18:04.084 --> 18:06.317
She used to be a stuntwoman
and she misses the action.

18:06.319 --> 18:08.586
Usually we stop her before
she gets to the street

18:08.588 --> 18:10.822
By yelling "cut!"

18:10.824 --> 18:12.723
That's very good news.

18:12.725 --> 18:15.760
Except for your mom
getting hit by a car.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.463
Hey, she's a stuntwoman.
That's pretty cool.

18:18.465 --> 18:19.764
Would I have seen her
in anything

18:19.766 --> 18:22.166
Other than
my dad's windshield?

18:24.570 --> 18:26.838
We're gonna go.

18:28.874 --> 18:30.842
- Come and get it.
- Hey.

18:30.844 --> 18:34.212
I brought us some dinner.
( laughs )

18:34.214 --> 18:35.780
I hope you like
biscuits and gravy

18:35.782 --> 18:37.548
Because I brought extry.

18:37.550 --> 18:39.884
Did you just
say "extry"?

18:39.886 --> 18:42.520
Yeah, I did, but if
you don't like the word,
I'll never use it again.

18:42.522 --> 18:45.223
No, no, I'm right good.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.492
It's very kind of you
to do this, ed.

18:47.494 --> 18:51.129
Oh, a fella can be nice
for no reason, right?

18:51.131 --> 18:53.431
I bought you a bundt cake
for dessert.

18:53.433 --> 18:55.166
It's all yours
just for being you.

18:55.168 --> 18:57.368
Thank you.

18:58.504 --> 19:01.606
-  <i>( knocking )</i>
<i>- oh, hang on.</i>

19:04.276 --> 19:06.577
- Charlie.
- Hey, dad.

19:06.579 --> 19:10.181
I've got to go.
They forgot to put honey
in for the biscuits.

19:10.183 --> 19:13.384
- I got some in the cupboard.
- I prefer it in the package.

19:14.553 --> 19:16.854
Leave me out of this
and save me a thigh.

19:18.591 --> 19:23.694
If this is all about you
coming over to thank me
for the money again,

19:23.696 --> 19:27.498
But if you'd like to stay
for dinner, ed bought extry.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.269
You can stop pretending
like everything's fine.

19:31.271 --> 19:33.437
I found out the real reason
you gave us the money.

19:33.439 --> 19:35.239
You hit a woman.

19:35.241 --> 19:37.175
I've never hit a woman
in my life.

19:37.177 --> 19:41.512
- With a car.
- Oh, yeah, I did that
the other day.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.614
You'll be happy
to know they're coming
after everything I own--

19:43.616 --> 19:45.883
My house,
sam's college fund,
everything.

19:45.885 --> 19:48.186
Oh, no, charlie,
I swear to you

19:48.188 --> 19:49.954
I never thought
this could happen.

19:49.956 --> 19:51.489
Ed said you did.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.291
Well, actually, I did.

19:53.293 --> 19:54.892
I just never thought
it would happen.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.661
But, look, this is
not a problem.

19:56.663 --> 19:58.663
You just give me
all the money back
and I'll handle it.

19:58.665 --> 20:00.464
I can't give it back.
We spent it.

20:00.466 --> 20:03.834
You spent it?
It's been less
than 24 hours.

20:03.836 --> 20:05.203
We got excited
and bought stuff.

20:05.205 --> 20:07.805
Oh, god,
what have I done?

20:07.807 --> 20:11.676
Relax, old man.
We didn't spend
all your money.

20:11.678 --> 20:12.944
But I talked
to the woman's family.

20:12.946 --> 20:14.412
You know
she's demented now?

20:14.414 --> 20:16.981
Oh, god, no.

20:16.983 --> 20:20.585
So what you're saying
is she can't testify.

20:21.853 --> 20:22.954
You're unbelievable.

20:22.956 --> 20:24.689
I can't even
teach you a lesson.

20:24.691 --> 20:26.624
The reason she ran
in front of your car

20:26.626 --> 20:28.459
Is because she already
had dementia.

20:28.461 --> 20:29.994
They're not gonna sue you,
but I'm thinking about it.

20:29.996 --> 20:32.830
Oh, no, listen, charlie,
I have learned my lesson.

20:32.832 --> 20:35.733
I feel terrible.
Look, you just give me
all my money back

20:35.735 --> 20:38.236
And I'll put my tail
between my legs

20:38.238 --> 20:40.705
And just shuffle sadly
off back to the bank.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.707
Well, I can give you
my share back,

20:42.709 --> 20:44.408
But I invested sam's
in a college fund.

20:44.410 --> 20:46.978
Okay, I can live with that.

20:46.980 --> 20:48.980
What about the money
I gave to jen?

20:48.982 --> 20:51.015
Bad news.

20:51.017 --> 20:54.418
It's parked at the edge
of koreatown selling turkey.

20:55.621 --> 20:58.256
Turkey dinner for sale.

20:58.258 --> 21:01.325
Turkey dinner for sale.

21:02.361 --> 21:05.663
Turkey dinner for sale.

21:05.665 --> 21:08.766
Turkey truck for sale.

21:09.868 --> 21:12.336
Turkey truck for sale.

21:13.839 --> 21:16.307
Turkey truck for sale.
