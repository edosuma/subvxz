WEBVTT

00:48.292 --> 00:51.463
I'm here on the ground where a group
of what the White House

00:51.563 --> 00:54.031
is now officially calling
the walking dead

00:54.131 --> 00:56.935
are what I'm officially coining
brain feasting.

00:58.275 --> 01:01.373
Now full disclosure. I've been absolutely
warned against coming here

01:01.473 --> 01:05.075
and have signed a liability release
in the case I am ravaged on camera.

01:05.176 --> 01:08.780
News 13, consider this
my interview for lead anchor.

01:09.380 --> 01:12.329
We are now confirming
the virus raping humanity

01:12.429 --> 01:16.554
is in fact a simple case of a restaurant
employee not washing his hands,

01:16.654 --> 01:19.011
then preparing sushi gloveless

01:19.111 --> 01:22.860
for a group of homeless men
invited in after raiding the dumpster.

01:22.960 --> 01:26.631
This restaurant will not be passing
its next health inspection.

01:26.731 --> 01:30.233
Excuse me, sir. Where were you
when the outbreak began?

01:30.584 --> 01:32.532
We're live, so please don't cuss.

01:36.306 --> 01:40.277
Shit! Shaun, we gotta go.
Come on. Let's get out of here.

02:27.624 --> 02:31.429
<i>I'm a dumb-ass.
Even for a dead guy, this is stupid.</i>

02:31.529 --> 02:35.767
<i>A hospital? Why the hell did I drag
my cinder-block feet in here?</i>

02:36.067 --> 02:38.803
<i>There's no food, no living people.</i>

02:38.903 --> 02:42.274
<i>Everyone dies and rots
on their own in hospitals.</i>

02:42.374 --> 02:44.909
<i>The living treat us
like second-class citizens.</i>

02:45.009 --> 02:47.278
<i>They've coined us what we
consider racial slurs...</i>

02:48.219 --> 02:50.982
<i>zombies, walkers,</i>

02:51.482 --> 02:54.318
<i>travelers, shufflers.</i>

02:55.019 --> 02:58.555
<i>We're the new gingers,
soulless and shunned.</i>

03:02.358 --> 03:06.597
<i>My zigga. Man, I was really hoping
for a pumping heart.</i>

03:09.099 --> 03:11.815
<i>Poor guy hasn't remastered speech yet.</i>

03:12.303 --> 03:14.138
<i>I'm getting there.</i>

03:14.905 --> 03:16.941
'Sup?

03:17.041 --> 03:18.779
<i>Well, sort of.</i>

03:18.879 --> 03:20.611
So? Everybody my age had...

03:20.711 --> 03:22.379
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

03:22.979 --> 03:25.070
<i>All right, my man's got two choices.</i>

03:25.170 --> 03:27.607
<i>One, charge straight at this guy
and hope he misfires.</i>

03:27.707 --> 03:29.197
<i>Then he can chow down.</i>

03:29.297 --> 03:32.243
<i>Or two, he can do the dumb thing
and try to reason with him.</i>

03:32.343 --> 03:35.613
<i>See, we're somehow inexplicably
regaining our humanity.</i>

03:35.713 --> 03:39.274
<i>Judging by our greeting, this guy
isn't very far along in the process.</i>

03:39.374 --> 03:41.353
<i>Go with option one, buddy.</i>

03:46.911 --> 03:49.193
- <i>Bad move.</i>
- Good shot.

03:49.828 --> 03:52.918
- Ain't computer programming, kid.
- <i>Outnumbered. I'll skip this meal.</i>

03:53.018 --> 03:55.766
...if you learn, like, C++,
HTML, just like the basics...

03:55.866 --> 04:00.070
I knew that was a bad analogy
when I said it. Let's go. <i>VÃ¡monos.</i>

04:00.170 --> 04:03.352
- Any specifics?
- I don't know. Let's find some shit.

04:03.452 --> 04:07.278
Looks like they bounced pretty quick.
This place is, like, fully stocked.

04:07.378 --> 04:09.680
Just get somethin'.
We don't got much time.

04:09.980 --> 04:13.218
- Do you have diabetes?
- No. You find any...

04:13.318 --> 04:15.787
No, there's no porn.
This is a hospital, not a sperm bank.

04:15.887 --> 04:17.822
Keep looking. It's important.

04:17.922 --> 04:20.425
I always wanted to pee on one of these.

04:20.524 --> 04:23.528
- Can we hustle, Usain?
- Yes!

04:23.828 --> 04:25.195
- Â¡VÃ¡monos!
- Coming.

04:25.595 --> 04:26.830
You get that blue, Heisenberg?

04:26.930 --> 04:29.080
No. Stop calling me that.
That's, like, super close...

04:29.180 --> 04:30.835
Carl!

04:35.907 --> 04:37.823
Living or dead?

04:37.923 --> 04:41.011
Speak English, or you're headless,
you son of a bitch!

04:49.488 --> 04:52.223
- Ain't computer programming, kid.
- You know, that's actually not...

05:11.509 --> 05:13.111
Carl.

05:21.685 --> 05:23.522
Carl!

05:24.322 --> 05:27.358
Speak English, or you're headless,
you son of a bitch!

05:30.628 --> 05:32.497
Lower your weapons.

05:33.797 --> 05:37.124
Be a lot more intimidating if you had
more than a finger gun there, chief.

05:37.224 --> 05:39.303
Sheriff.

05:39.403 --> 05:43.141
Oh, God. Looks like some
sort of mass-murder crime scene.

05:43.241 --> 05:46.238
How long was your slumber?

05:46.777 --> 05:50.415
- God, it's like staring at the sun.
- Don't look at it, gay wad.

05:50.515 --> 05:53.718
I can't stop. It's like a fri...
Oh, my God.

05:54.118 --> 05:56.921
It's like the two dried grapes
at the end of a branch.

05:57.021 --> 06:01.191
- Boots first? Interesting choice.
- And wide-open asshole.

06:01.991 --> 06:05.827
Whole gang came to play.
That redefines chode.

06:05.927 --> 06:08.765
I don't know if these are my boots!

06:10.701 --> 06:14.038
- That is a tiny, tiny coma dick.
- Yeah.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.275
What happened?
You get in a shootout or something?

06:17.375 --> 06:19.594
Take a bullet for your partner
like a bad-ass?

06:19.694 --> 06:21.662
Last thing I remember...

06:27.351 --> 06:30.922
- Daddy? You're gonna watch me bat, right?
- Oh, absolutely, Chris.

06:31.022 --> 06:34.335
I'm just gonna... gonna go over here
and get a hot dog while you're on deck.

06:34.435 --> 06:37.561
- All right, buddy?
- I'm gonna hit a homer for you.

06:38.176 --> 06:41.900
Okay, you do that.
I'm 150% confident in you, Chris.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.302
Hot dog! Get your hot dogs!
Hot hot dogs!

06:45.702 --> 06:48.138
All right, boys, pile in!

06:49.139 --> 06:51.304
- Give me one of them wieners.
- Daddy, look!

06:51.404 --> 06:54.011
Nice. Yeah. Keep goin', Chris!

06:54.111 --> 06:57.181
Good swing, follow through!
Fundamentals, that kind of shit!

06:57.281 --> 07:00.071
- Strike!
- It's right on the tee, buddy!

07:00.171 --> 07:01.751
- Go, Chris!
- Strike two!

07:01.851 --> 07:05.056
Gotta swing through it. It's on the tee!
Hit the ball on the tee!

07:05.156 --> 07:07.370
- Come on, Chris!
- Strike three!

07:07.470 --> 07:09.544
Would you goddamn hit the ball?!

07:09.644 --> 07:13.003
Chris! Chris! Chris! Chris...

07:18.735 --> 07:20.456
He's out!

07:21.805 --> 07:24.310
Kid sounds like a real big pussy.

07:24.410 --> 07:27.938
- No offense.
- Hey, baseball's just not his...

07:28.746 --> 07:31.288
Yeah, he's a real big pussy.

07:32.583 --> 07:36.753
Somebody tell me what the hell's
going on here.

07:37.138 --> 07:39.323
- Kind of hard to explain.
- <i>Is it, though?</i>

07:39.423 --> 07:42.760
No, it ain't.
It's the goddamn zombie apocalypse.

07:42.860 --> 07:44.829
World has gone crazy.

07:44.929 --> 07:48.398
#ReasonsIHateZombies
was the number one trend on Twitter

07:48.498 --> 07:51.596
- before the Internet went out.
- <i>Truth.</i>

07:52.236 --> 07:54.785
<i>Is a zombie in a yellow shirt ironic?</i>

07:54.885 --> 07:57.291
<i>#ShitIGotNothing.</i>

07:57.541 --> 08:00.070
Stop reading my tweets, Jane.

08:03.998 --> 08:06.127
<i>Stepmoms are bitches.</i>

08:07.518 --> 08:10.754
You're telling me...
that there's no more Twitter?

08:10.854 --> 08:15.086
- Yeah.
- There's no more @TheRealSheriffLincoln?

08:15.860 --> 08:17.722
It's gone.

08:23.317 --> 08:24.626
Instagram?

08:26.947 --> 08:30.870
No. No, no...

08:33.710 --> 08:36.246
- Pinterest?
- No Tumblr.

08:36.346 --> 08:37.681
LinkedIn?

08:37.780 --> 08:40.717
- Yeah, yeah. LinkedIn's still there.
- Nobody uses that.

08:40.818 --> 08:44.621
Well, hey, man, we are shacked up
at a mall, couple of other people.

08:44.921 --> 08:48.110
- We're surviving, so if you want to come...
- I gotta go find my family.

08:48.210 --> 08:52.062
- Ain't too many people left out there.
- Yeah, and judging by that baseball story...

08:52.462 --> 08:56.601
- Hey, my family is alive, all right?
- Okay.

08:56.701 --> 09:00.103
I know it. My wife is smart.

09:00.203 --> 09:03.068
She used to fend for herself
all the time at work.

09:04.742 --> 09:06.845
- Well, good luck with that, Dep.
- Sheriff.

09:07.145 --> 09:08.733
Deputy Sheriff.

09:09.033 --> 09:11.382
- Just Sheriff.
- Just Sheriff.

09:11.482 --> 09:14.385
Well, we're gonna get these supplies
back to our people.

09:14.885 --> 09:17.921
If and when you find your family,
Sheriff, we're there.

09:18.021 --> 09:20.968
You know, I was gonna throw
this little piece of shit away, but...

09:21.424 --> 09:22.844
seems like maybe you could use it.

09:22.944 --> 09:26.152
Sure hope that long nap of yours
didn't cause your aim to be off.

09:26.252 --> 09:29.497
Every damn shot is precious.

09:29.833 --> 09:31.736
Junior here has lost more
than I can count.

09:31.836 --> 09:33.437
Thank you. Junior?

09:33.537 --> 09:34.792
- Green Bay.
- Green Bay.

09:34.892 --> 09:36.640
- Chicago.
- Those your legal names?

09:36.740 --> 09:39.677
- No, we go by our favorite...
- Styles of pizza.

09:40.277 --> 09:44.185
- Chicago, Brooklyn, Green Bay.
- Green Bay style pizza?

09:44.285 --> 09:46.217
- Frozen.
- All right, all right, I get it.

09:46.317 --> 09:49.653
If I run into a gay fat guy
named DiGiorno Stuffed Crust,

09:49.753 --> 09:51.293
send him your way.

09:54.458 --> 09:56.659
That was a joke.

09:57.361 --> 10:00.026
Did humor get killed off
in the apocalypse, too?

10:00.126 --> 10:02.916
No, I think it died
about five seconds ago.

10:03.016 --> 10:04.785
Good luck, y'all.

10:04.935 --> 10:07.645
Sure hope to see you later.
That was weird.

10:14.311 --> 10:16.344
<i>Oh, what up, girl?</i>

10:16.664 --> 10:18.548
<i>Definitely got some blood flowing now.</i>

10:25.922 --> 10:28.626
<i>Mall? I could do that.</i>

10:28.726 --> 10:31.027
<i>Possible Cinnabon leftovers,</i>

10:31.127 --> 10:33.597
<i>but also people who want
to blow my brains out.</i>

10:34.778 --> 10:37.261
<i>Cinnabon and hot girl win.</i>

10:57.515 --> 10:59.316
Little girl?

11:00.223 --> 11:03.432
Sweetheart? Where's your parents?

11:14.337 --> 11:17.308
First zombie kill's gonna be a toddler.

11:17.408 --> 11:21.612
I'm not a zombie.
I can't find my mommy and daddy.

11:22.642 --> 11:24.910
That's exactly what a zombie would say.

11:42.299 --> 11:44.894
- Have you seen my daughter?
- I did.

11:45.503 --> 11:47.029
Clever assholes.

13:07.351 --> 13:09.235
That Sheriff's as good as dead.

13:09.335 --> 13:12.689
What? I'm sure he can fend for himself.
They're trained for this.

13:12.789 --> 13:16.615
Did they add zombie apocalypse training
to the police academy before the outbreak?

13:16.715 --> 13:18.879
Good thing, because they
totally kept us safe.

13:18.979 --> 13:23.334
Jesus, you two fight way too much to end up
together like everyone expects you to.

13:23.434 --> 13:25.828
I'm gonna check the gennies.

13:30.974 --> 13:34.978
Keep those sticky fingers to yourself
while we were gone, little sis?

13:35.378 --> 13:38.682
No, hell, no. Little silent monk
tried to take my arrows.

13:38.782 --> 13:40.945
Hey, Chicago, man,
check under the pillows.

13:44.086 --> 13:46.972
Keep your damn hands
in your Polly pockets.

13:48.812 --> 13:50.047
Was it a pretty fruitful run?

13:50.147 --> 13:53.567
Yeah. Figured it was only a matter of time
before one of these chicks get prego.

13:53.830 --> 13:55.832
Well, she's barely 14,

13:55.932 --> 13:59.770
and I'd rather screw a zombie
than any of you, so I think we're good.

13:59.870 --> 14:02.106
Hey, y'all give any thoughts
on that farm idea?

14:02.206 --> 14:06.510
- Rumor has it, ain't no walkers out there.
- Safe havens don't exist. They're mirages.

14:06.610 --> 14:08.378
There's nothing pure left in this world.

14:08.478 --> 14:10.672
- Also check the gennies!
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:10.772 --> 14:13.685
You're just upset about the Selena Gomez
cardboard cutout incident?

14:13.785 --> 14:16.454
It was late. I was lonely.
It looked real. Drop it.

14:16.554 --> 14:19.523
I, for one, think that we should go
to the farm, you know.

14:19.823 --> 14:21.418
This place...

14:23.094 --> 14:26.897
This place sucks,
and there could be some food there.

14:27.605 --> 14:29.534
I, for one, could go
for a scenery change.

14:29.634 --> 14:32.785
Only reason I ever came
to this mall was for Rico's, and...

14:32.885 --> 14:34.938
now that it's gone,
ain't no reason to be here.

14:35.038 --> 14:37.422
- Looks like it's up to you, chickenshit.
- Fine. Whatever.

14:37.522 --> 14:41.579
I'm in, but we're goin' tomorrow.
I'm tired, and I want to sleep.

14:41.679 --> 14:43.908
You just want
one more night with Selena.

14:55.492 --> 14:57.364
Baby?

14:57.861 --> 14:59.723
I'm home.

15:03.800 --> 15:05.663
Carl?

15:07.154 --> 15:09.031
Carl?

15:09.873 --> 15:13.678
It's Daddy. I'm okay, son. How you been?

15:14.278 --> 15:16.273
Anyone home?

15:16.847 --> 15:18.709
Zombie!

15:30.059 --> 15:33.149
Well, if anything was gonna
get you off the bottle, son,

15:33.249 --> 15:35.618
it's a goddamn zombie apocalypse.

15:53.049 --> 15:55.552
<i>Daddy, I went to work with Mommy.</i>

15:55.652 --> 15:59.224
<i>We hide there.
Love you. Miss you, Chrissy.</i>

15:59.774 --> 16:02.804
<i>P.S. Sorry about your coma.
I struck out.</i>

16:08.632 --> 16:10.897
I gotta take a shit.

16:30.453 --> 16:32.656
<i>Damn, I wish I could still
ride my bike...</i>

16:32.756 --> 16:36.370
<i>but nope. It's just me
and my floppy-ass feet.</i>

16:37.326 --> 16:41.532
<i>'Sup, guys? Please don't follow me.
You'll blow up my spot.</i>

16:41.932 --> 16:44.835
<i>Shit, they can't hear
my inner monologue.</i>

16:44.935 --> 16:47.336
No. Go away.

16:47.436 --> 16:50.693
<i>All they want to prove is that they're
changing for the better, but no sane person</i>

16:50.793 --> 16:54.648
<i>will see it that way,
not while they're in a huge mob.</i>

16:55.179 --> 16:58.114
<i>Nope. No. No, no, no, no, no, no.</i>

16:58.214 --> 17:01.618
<i>Damn it, stay back. This is not a party.</i>

17:01.718 --> 17:03.720
<i>Please stop following me.</i>

17:03.820 --> 17:06.960
<i>You're just gonna be
a massive dead cock-block.</i>

17:36.020 --> 17:40.440
Main stage costs canned goods.
Champagne room is a handgun, minimum.

17:40.540 --> 17:42.542
There's no sex in the champagne room.

17:42.992 --> 17:45.621
All right,
so what's it gonna be, asshole?

17:45.821 --> 17:47.517
- Dad?
- Carl?

17:47.617 --> 17:50.644
- Who?
- Put the gun down, son.

17:51.201 --> 17:54.899
- You're alive.
- Yeah, I'm alive. I'm alive, Carl.

17:58.825 --> 18:00.604
Carl.

18:01.611 --> 18:02.980
Sorry I batted you into a coma.

18:03.080 --> 18:05.850
It's okay. Just gotta choke up
on the bat next time, all right?

18:05.950 --> 18:09.398
Actually, I used that bat to kill my first
zombie. Remember my girlfriend, Kayla?

18:09.498 --> 18:12.289
Girlfriend? I remember you
playing dolls with her and stuff,

18:12.389 --> 18:14.724
but you didn't finger her
or anything, did you?

18:14.824 --> 18:17.843
She's headless now.
Grown up a lot since then.

18:17.943 --> 18:21.365
- Obviously you have.
- I'm a small business owner now.

18:21.465 --> 18:25.072
That dipshit manager, Scott, was dead
when Mom and I got here a month ago,

18:25.702 --> 18:28.872
but I figured people still need
entertainment... so I kept it open.

18:28.972 --> 18:32.275
Found a generator in the storage closet,
so we have power.

18:32.375 --> 18:35.545
I mean, it's a little dirty, but brains
are a pain in the ass to scrub.

18:35.645 --> 18:40.234
I gotta hand it to you, Carl.
This is one hell of a business. I mean...

18:40.334 --> 18:45.382
hey, look at that chick on the pole, man.
I think she's got eyes for me.

18:48.024 --> 18:50.460
I'm proud of you, Carl.

18:52.028 --> 18:54.198
Who? Wait.
You had another son from this?

18:54.298 --> 18:59.336
No, no, I... it's this coma thing.
It must have messed me up.

19:00.136 --> 19:03.700
Your mom, she... Oh, God.

19:05.441 --> 19:09.479
- Didn't turn, did she?
- Hell, yeah, she turned.

19:09.879 --> 19:13.667
She turned in new moves.
All right, watch this.

19:13.767 --> 19:16.954
And now we welcome to the main stage

19:17.054 --> 19:20.576
our only living girl!

19:22.126 --> 19:24.962
Shut the hell up! How many times
do I have to tell you?

19:25.062 --> 19:29.166
My beautiful mother... Barbie.

19:29.266 --> 19:32.903
- I been waiting all day for this!
- Show us those living tits!

19:33.003 --> 19:36.375
Hey, that's my wife!

20:28.592 --> 20:30.660
Chris! Chris!

20:30.760 --> 20:33.513
Hey! Freaking wanker!

20:33.613 --> 20:36.442
Don't you get it? No touching!

20:37.901 --> 20:39.538
Baby?

20:39.638 --> 20:41.298
Darlin'!

20:51.781 --> 20:55.619
What the hell? That was my last can
of beans, and all we get to do is watch?

20:56.019 --> 20:58.321
- Baby. I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

20:58.421 --> 21:00.824
- I'm sorry I left you.
- I forgive you.

21:00.924 --> 21:02.692
It was just overrun, that hospital.

21:02.792 --> 21:05.663
We just had to barricade your door
and just pray you were gonna be okay.

21:05.763 --> 21:07.764
- I'm okay!
- Praise the Lord!

21:07.864 --> 21:09.166
Praise the Lord!

21:09.266 --> 21:11.401
Bet that's the only time
that's been said from the pole.

21:11.501 --> 21:14.406
Ed, you fat lard, get over to the bar,
and help yourself

21:14.506 --> 21:18.815
- to a big fat bowl of shut the fuck up!
- Language, Chris!

21:18.915 --> 21:22.113
Baby, we're way beyond language
being a problem here.

21:22.213 --> 21:25.116
Is there going to be a show or what?
We've been waitin' hours to see her.

21:25.216 --> 21:28.218
Hey, hey, hey, hey, guys!
Show is over, all right?

21:28.318 --> 21:30.804
Now go find another place
to waste your life.

21:30.904 --> 21:32.605
We'll just go back to the Winchester.

21:32.705 --> 21:37.104
Their happy hour isn't complete shite
like this fine establishment!

21:39.145 --> 21:41.120
Oh, no!

21:51.024 --> 21:54.628
Oh, my God, honey. Stay with me.
Oh, not your boob!

21:54.728 --> 21:59.192
There's gotta be something we can do!
Somebody do something!

22:02.077 --> 22:04.304
God, I wasn't talking about that!

22:04.404 --> 22:07.107
I was talking about
cutting her boob off!

22:07.207 --> 22:09.897
Nobody pays top dollar
to see a one-boob stripper.

22:09.997 --> 22:12.346
Oh, no, no!

22:12.446 --> 22:14.144
No!

22:14.547 --> 22:15.982
No!

22:16.082 --> 22:19.629
It's the world we live in now.
Take a minute. Breathe deep.

22:19.729 --> 22:22.604
I gotta go put out an ad
for a headliner with double Ds.

22:22.704 --> 22:25.337
- Try Craigslist.
- Oh, yeah, and here's your Colt.

22:25.437 --> 22:29.497
Didn't want some douche-bag doctor
stealing it whilst you were coma-ed out.

22:36.770 --> 22:38.471
You're a good shot, son.

22:38.586 --> 22:42.485
It's funny? I couldn't hit a ball off
a tee before the apocalypse, and now...

22:42.585 --> 22:44.836
I can get a bullet between
the eyes like it's nothing.

22:44.936 --> 22:47.140
It's fucking hilarious!

22:48.914 --> 22:50.907
Listen up.

22:51.415 --> 22:53.820
I met these two guys at the hospital.

22:54.519 --> 22:56.422
They're camped out at the mall.

22:56.522 --> 22:59.159
Bald redneck and jumpy little shit
that shoots like a girl?

22:59.559 --> 23:01.450
- Yeah, that's them.
- They came in here once.

23:01.550 --> 23:04.947
Redneck was motorboating Mom,
so I kicked their asses out.

23:05.097 --> 23:06.900
All right.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.235
- We're gonna hit the mall then.
- You think this place can just run itself?

23:10.335 --> 23:14.040
You're 12 years old. You shouldn't
even know about strip joints!

23:14.887 --> 23:18.674
So now you want to be my dad!
Where you been when I needed you?

23:18.974 --> 23:22.379
I was in a fucking coma because of you!

23:22.479 --> 23:24.052
- We're heading to the mall.
- Fine.

23:24.152 --> 23:27.854
We'll load everything in my truck out back.
I could drive now. Tossed my V-card, too.

23:28.254 --> 23:30.350
One for my homeboys.

23:33.059 --> 23:34.287
Let's hit it.

23:50.576 --> 23:52.178
All right, have a good watch.

23:52.578 --> 23:55.820
Front entrance is clear, just some
kid zoms dragging Build-A-Bears.

23:55.920 --> 23:59.018
I loved my Build-A-Bear.
He had a cape and a baseball cap.

23:59.118 --> 24:02.655
His name was Super Shortstop, 'cause he
was like half the size of the other bears.

24:02.755 --> 24:05.559
- Supes adorbs.
- How have you survived so long?

24:06.765 --> 24:08.861
Don't fall asleep.
I want at least four hours.

24:08.961 --> 24:10.146
Copy that.

24:10.246 --> 24:13.600
- Enjoy your swimsuit edition.
- It's a hunting magazine, obviously.

24:13.700 --> 24:16.770
There's dead deer and blood and guts
and fishhooks and manly stuff.

24:16.870 --> 24:21.034
- All right, whatever you say, little bitch.
- For the record, I hate that nickname.

24:22.443 --> 24:25.628
So... close.

24:27.883 --> 24:29.352
<i>Almost there.</i>

24:30.684 --> 24:32.413
<i>I can smell Abercrombie.</i>

24:32.513 --> 24:35.289
<i>It's giving me a headache from here,
and my brain barely even works.</i>

24:35.389 --> 24:38.395
Oh, no, that's good.
Be my... be my valentine.

24:39.725 --> 24:42.308
No, don't touch down there.
Don't touch. Not there! Stop.

24:42.408 --> 24:45.265
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

24:45.965 --> 24:47.639
I'm so sorry.

24:47.739 --> 24:51.532
I'm gonna go do a round.
Sleep tight. I'll keep us safe.

24:52.672 --> 24:55.302
Yes, sleep, child.

25:00.247 --> 25:03.450
Now don't listen to Brooklyn.
"Spring Breakers" was amazing,

25:03.550 --> 25:07.254
although I do wish you would've shown
your boobies. Was that weird?

25:07.354 --> 25:09.171
But I respect your purity,
no matter what.

25:14.861 --> 25:16.729
I cannot wait for the day

25:16.829 --> 25:20.294
that we can have these heart-to-hearts
without this pane of glass between us.

25:24.170 --> 25:27.379
Just really wanted some moment and...

25:30.076 --> 25:31.912
Jesus.

25:32.012 --> 25:34.981
Figured there'd be a breach
with Shotgun Susan on watch!

25:35.081 --> 25:36.749
You see anything while you were
cleaning up your mess?

25:36.849 --> 25:38.951
- It wasn't near me. It was...
- Must've been from the other side.

25:39.051 --> 25:40.887
Brooklyn, you come with me.
We'll check the front.

25:40.987 --> 25:43.757
Y'all three go around,
check the side entrance.

25:43.857 --> 25:45.925
God damn, Harlem.

25:46.438 --> 25:48.395
You ain't doing good
for your city stereotype.

25:48.495 --> 25:49.832
Hey!

25:49.932 --> 25:52.799
- You think she's just silent for no reason?
- You comin' at me, Slick?

25:52.899 --> 25:55.618
- No, Slick, but listen...
- No. Did you double-Slick me?

25:55.868 --> 25:58.958
This whole ordeal has been so traumatic
for her that she can't speak anymore.

25:59.108 --> 26:01.374
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- Yes, I do. I'm doing it for you.

26:01.474 --> 26:03.777
This is a terrible hiding spot.
No, don't.

26:05.277 --> 26:08.157
<i>Louder entrance than I would've liked,
but it's hard to push open sliding doors</i>

26:08.257 --> 26:10.181
<i>with zero motor skills.</i>

26:10.281 --> 26:12.513
<i>Hope they didn't get the wrong idea.</i>

26:16.422 --> 26:19.052
<i>Just be confident.
Girls like confidence.</i>

26:22.061 --> 26:25.031
<i>But on second thought,
I think I'm just gonna hang back.</i>

26:26.799 --> 26:29.319
<i>Like way back.</i>

26:41.881 --> 26:44.945
<i>Holy shit, this is sexy.</i>

26:59.065 --> 27:01.309
<i>God damn it. Hero time.</i>

27:06.939 --> 27:10.270
Smell... like shit.

27:10.710 --> 27:12.646
Hot... zombie.

27:12.746 --> 27:15.442
Want... to bang.

27:19.553 --> 27:23.423
Oh, my God. Thank you.
That's so sweet. Wait!

27:23.523 --> 27:25.424
- What the hell for?
- He saved me.

27:25.524 --> 27:28.072
Saved you? Are you crazy? Are you bit?

27:28.172 --> 27:30.663
No, asshole.
Get your dart gun out of my face.

27:31.063 --> 27:32.999
So let me get this straight.

27:33.099 --> 27:36.469
You, a dead-ass walker,

27:36.569 --> 27:41.407
saved the life of your food
like some sort of vegan zombie?

27:42.675 --> 27:44.945
What's your name, Romeo?

27:45.045 --> 27:46.813
Romeo.

27:46.913 --> 27:49.383
Yeah, that's what... that's what I said.
What's your name?

27:49.483 --> 27:51.417
Romeo.

27:51.517 --> 27:54.020
- Romero?
- He said, "Romeo."

27:54.620 --> 27:57.824
That's so romantic and so dangerous,

27:57.924 --> 28:00.059
but your unrequited
and superficial love for me

28:00.159 --> 28:03.638
totally overcome the very instinct
that keeps you alive.

28:04.863 --> 28:08.000
Y'all okay? Who's this pale,
"Twilight" -looking douche?

28:08.100 --> 28:10.971
It's Romeo. He saved my life,
and he's staying with us.

28:11.071 --> 28:12.673
Hell, no, he ain't. He's a walker.

28:12.773 --> 28:16.642
Think about it. Think about it.
If he's changing, maybe they all are.

28:16.742 --> 28:19.813
He can convince them not to eat us
long enough for him to turn fully human,

28:19.913 --> 28:21.681
and I can get in those dirty jeans.

28:21.781 --> 28:24.717
You want us to risk keeping him around
'cause you're horny?

28:24.817 --> 28:26.486
Yes, absolutely.

28:26.586 --> 28:29.756
We could cut his stupid little zombie
jaw off. He wouldn't bite us then.

28:29.856 --> 28:31.657
That ain't a bad idea.

28:31.757 --> 28:35.708
Chop off them gangly arms of his
so he can't grab us.

28:35.808 --> 28:39.112
And then we could hang our bags
on his skinny-ass neck.

28:39.212 --> 28:42.115
You're not touching him. Where's Harlem?

28:42.215 --> 28:44.350
She's with Green Bay
guarding the entrance.

28:44.450 --> 28:47.487
Only a matter of time
before we get swarmed again.

28:47.887 --> 28:49.022
Whatever.

28:49.122 --> 28:54.460
So... does your sister have,
like, a type of guy that...

28:54.560 --> 28:57.530
I knew it. Awesome.
Okay, so here's what I'm thinking.

28:57.630 --> 28:59.899
I take her to that little,
like, Italian joint,

28:59.999 --> 29:03.286
like the tables there
in the food court... Shit!

29:03.386 --> 29:05.555
Here! Camouflage yourself.

29:05.655 --> 29:08.040
No? Okay. I don't know.

29:08.140 --> 29:09.635
Something here...

29:11.478 --> 29:13.279
Hey, I know that guy. It's cool.

29:13.379 --> 29:16.550
He was in a coma for, like, a month,
and he survived with no food and no water,

29:16.650 --> 29:18.628
and he didn't shit himself,
which is astounding.

29:21.454 --> 29:24.958
Lower your guns.
And your toys, homeless boy.

29:25.058 --> 29:26.338
- Carl...
- Chris.

29:26.438 --> 29:28.294
Yeah, whatever. They're okay.

29:28.394 --> 29:31.264
- Good to see you, Sheriff.
- Can't say I'm glad to see you...

29:31.364 --> 29:34.054
- Mr. "Put it on my tab. I'm good for it."
- Shit.

29:34.154 --> 29:36.803
Can somebody lock up
before this turns into a real party?

29:37.003 --> 29:39.041
Do it, cheesecake.

29:39.472 --> 29:41.654
You boys got Jim or Jack?

29:41.754 --> 29:43.743
I just shot my mother.

29:43.843 --> 29:45.438
I could use a stiff drink.

29:46.812 --> 29:48.071
Nice mall.

29:49.515 --> 29:51.545
Hey, is there a Linen 'n Things in here?

29:54.719 --> 29:56.809
- Let's go, Carl.
- Chris.

29:56.909 --> 29:59.485
Yeah. Thanks for remembering.

30:00.359 --> 30:03.412
<i>Well, it's not a Holiday
Inn Express, but it'll do.</i>

30:03.512 --> 30:05.265
Who's this fricking guy?

30:05.365 --> 30:08.301
- Romeo.
- Romero? Like...

30:08.401 --> 30:10.071
Romeo.

30:10.171 --> 30:13.306
And he saved me from a group attack
while you were shooting out windows.

30:13.706 --> 30:15.212
What's wrong with him?

30:15.312 --> 30:19.495
He's special, can't speak well,
very emotionally damaged,

30:19.595 --> 30:22.465
- and super hot.
- He looks like dead E.T.

30:22.565 --> 30:25.284
He's a hero, and he's staying with us.

30:25.384 --> 30:28.405
- Ain't got the space.
- Camp's not big enough.

30:28.505 --> 30:31.424
And he can share my sleeping bag.
It's not a problem.

30:31.524 --> 30:33.786
Darnell, I see you.

30:45.441 --> 30:48.575
- Did y'all know each other before the outbreak?
- Fate brought us together.

30:48.675 --> 30:52.945
By fate, I mean I was at a gas station
looking for some porn.

30:53.045 --> 30:54.250
Portable reading material.

30:54.350 --> 30:58.985
And old sissy shit shooter almost took off
my head thinking I was a zombie.

30:59.085 --> 31:01.820
Lucky enough for me, he's about
as good a shot as Helen Keller,

31:01.920 --> 31:03.156
her being a woman and all.

31:03.256 --> 31:06.193
Felt sorry for the kid. Thought he might
need some extra protection.

31:06.293 --> 31:11.229
Yeah, he'd be dead. So where'd
you meet the girls and dart boy?

31:12.172 --> 31:13.299
Those little bitches?

31:13.399 --> 31:14.204
Bang.

31:14.304 --> 31:17.037
You know you don't have
to make the sound effects.

31:17.137 --> 31:18.806
- Makes it easier that way.
- No, it doesn't.

31:18.906 --> 31:21.942
Got the dexterity of a cloven hoof.
You're terrible.

31:22.042 --> 31:23.703
Bang.

31:25.211 --> 31:27.855
- Guns, keys, no questions.
- Gun.

31:27.955 --> 31:30.983
Don't have keys. Maxi pads
in the bathroom with the toilet paper.

31:31.083 --> 31:33.180
There might be some Ritz crackers.
One question.

31:33.280 --> 31:37.157
- Can I keep my birth beads, please?
- John freakin' McClane.

31:37.257 --> 31:39.425
Whatever you say, little bitch.

31:39.525 --> 31:42.656
That's mean. Oh, come on.

31:45.898 --> 31:49.335
- I'm sorry, man.
- You're gonna make me lose my hair, kid.

31:49.435 --> 31:52.138
Darnell, well, he was holed up here
when we got here.

31:52.238 --> 31:54.149
- Ever found that titty mag?
- Still searching.

31:54.249 --> 31:59.158
Did have a pretty romantic night with a
Coldwater Creek catalog, though. Twice.

31:59.258 --> 32:02.181
All right, well, let me know.

32:02.281 --> 32:03.908
Balls just dropped, and...

32:04.008 --> 32:07.287
the only nonrotten hooters I seen
in the last month were my mom's.

32:07.387 --> 32:09.455
Will do, kid.

32:10.794 --> 32:15.261
Ain't nothin' wrong with your mom's
boobs, baby. All right? Hey.

32:15.361 --> 32:17.764
Brooklyn and I have this,
like, fifth-grade relationship

32:17.864 --> 32:20.933
where she's, like, mean to me
'cause she likes me.

32:21.033 --> 32:23.469
Harlem thinks I should go for it.
At least, I think she does.

32:23.569 --> 32:25.505
She doesn't talk, kind of like you.

32:25.605 --> 32:27.987
Brooklyn tells me you're, like, special,

32:28.087 --> 32:31.594
Something... like... that.

32:31.694 --> 32:34.714
That's incredible, man.
I so, like, admire your courage

32:34.814 --> 32:38.779
and your, like, will to survive
with... your dis... disability.

32:51.630 --> 32:54.567
Sheriff and I talked it through.
We're leaving.

32:54.667 --> 32:57.503
Hold up. What?
Who's gonna assume leadership?

32:57.603 --> 33:00.172
My instinct says Brooklyn,
but I will step up if...

33:00.272 --> 33:04.520
No, Nancy! We mean we're moving on
from the mall, all of us.

33:04.620 --> 33:08.580
Your instincts are way off.
You never defer leadership to a woman.

33:08.680 --> 33:11.433
I'm sorry. Did you forget who robbed you
blind right in front of your eyes?

33:11.533 --> 33:15.054
- Not sure that's as insulting as you think.
- Hey!

33:15.654 --> 33:18.357
This is not a democracy.

33:18.457 --> 33:21.461
The decision's been made.
We're heading to the farm.

33:21.561 --> 33:23.746
So which one of you is the dictator?

33:23.846 --> 33:25.515
- Me.
- Me.

33:25.615 --> 33:28.612
I guess it's one of them di-archy.

33:30.636 --> 33:32.372
That was a steel toe.

33:32.472 --> 33:34.174
- Pack it up!
- Gather your things.

33:34.274 --> 33:37.076
- We're moving out in an hour.
- Make it 55 minutes.

33:37.176 --> 33:40.413
- 45 minutes, we're gone.
- Change of plans. 30 minutes.

33:40.513 --> 33:44.254
- We're leaving right now.
- We should have left five minutes ago.

33:45.352 --> 33:47.754
I'll lead the way.
I know the country roads best.

33:47.854 --> 33:50.457
- But I got a bigger truck.
- Agree to disagree.

33:50.557 --> 33:53.659
- Shut your vagina holes.
- We got company!

33:53.759 --> 33:56.829
- Stand down! Stand down!
- We're not the walking dead!

33:57.329 --> 34:00.232
We're just on a Zombie Walk!
We are ZALARPing.

34:00.332 --> 34:02.105
- Zalarpine?
- ZALARPing!

34:02.205 --> 34:03.902
What?

34:04.002 --> 34:05.855
Zombie Apocalypse
Live Action Role Playing.

34:05.955 --> 34:08.139
That's like pretending to be Jewish
in the Holocaust.

34:08.239 --> 34:10.260
We're just trying to see
how the other half lives.

34:10.360 --> 34:13.079
Then get on with it somewhere else.
Let's go. We're moving out.

34:13.679 --> 34:15.398
Come on, buddy.
Hustle it up. Hustle it up.

34:15.498 --> 34:17.539
- Y'all drive safe.
- We will. Thanks.

34:17.639 --> 34:20.190
Hey, Gene. You can get up now.

34:24.891 --> 34:27.494
Hey, you guys hear rumors
about that super survivor?

34:27.594 --> 34:28.594
Super survivor?

34:28.695 --> 34:32.248
Rumor has it he's drifting
place to place...

34:32.349 --> 34:36.001
- waxing zombies.
- What do you mean, like bikini wax?

34:36.101 --> 34:37.937
No, man, whack, like the mob.

34:38.237 --> 34:40.139
World needs a hero like that
more than ever.

34:40.239 --> 34:43.609
Who the hell do you hear a rumor from?
You're around the same people all the time.

34:43.708 --> 34:46.579
You know what?
I don't have to answer myself to you.

34:46.679 --> 34:48.822
For all I know, you're the one
telling me the rumors.

34:48.922 --> 34:51.745
Did you ever think of that,
you little Rice Krispie treat?

34:52.085 --> 34:53.552
What?

34:53.652 --> 34:55.495
Green Bay, you know
with your seat selection,

34:55.594 --> 34:58.258
you have set a whole
new precedent for cock blocking.

34:58.358 --> 35:03.095
You are literally blocking Romeo's...
while figuratively blocking your own.

35:03.549 --> 35:06.592
- Ain't cool, man.
- Romeo's cool, right, bro?

35:06.966 --> 35:10.669
- Guess... so.
- Man of few words.

35:10.769 --> 35:12.806
Probably follow his lead, little squirt.

35:12.906 --> 35:16.075
Your talking sure ain't getting
your Mont Blanc in her Moleskein.

35:16.175 --> 35:17.930
- Moleskine.
- Your brat in her buns?

35:18.030 --> 35:21.680
- Your pin in my cushion?
- Somebody shit their pants?

35:22.187 --> 35:25.851
That you? You ever take a bath?

35:25.951 --> 35:29.338
- Like before the zombie apocalypse?
- Gun in my holster?

35:29.438 --> 35:31.807
- Pencil in her sharpener?
- Plug in my socket?

35:32.857 --> 35:35.827
You guys know the sixth most
deadly weapon?

35:36.389 --> 35:37.596
Crossbow.

35:37.696 --> 35:40.793
And you know what number five is? Spoon.

35:41.167 --> 35:44.679
You're freaking me out.
Just stare out the window or something.

35:46.773 --> 35:49.001
God damn it!

35:50.743 --> 35:52.194
I think they just hit a zombie.

35:54.012 --> 35:55.281
Hit a zombie.

35:55.381 --> 35:58.874
I will tell you my first zombie kill story.
So I was at the bowling alley...

36:08.143 --> 36:09.550
...so I shot one.

36:11.130 --> 36:12.698
- What about you, Green Bay?
- Brakes.

36:12.798 --> 36:16.569
- That don't make any sense.
- Put your foot on the brakes!

36:17.936 --> 36:21.507
- Shit, son, speak up!
- You had half a mile!

36:23.307 --> 36:24.860
Think we're here.

36:30.316 --> 36:31.639
Safe Haven Ranch.

36:33.486 --> 36:36.956
Darnell, lower your weapon. Listen up,
we don't know who these people are.

36:37.056 --> 36:39.879
They seem welcoming enough,
but we don't know their true intentions.

36:39.979 --> 36:41.394
It's a different world we live in now.

36:41.494 --> 36:44.126
We don't know what they had to do
to survive or what they became,

36:44.226 --> 36:47.299
so keep your guard up, everyone.

36:47.399 --> 36:50.870
- I was about to say the same damn thing.
- But you didn't.

36:50.970 --> 36:53.238
These could be cannibals.

36:53.863 --> 36:56.730
They could be hoarding zombies
in a barn somewhere or starting a cult.

36:56.830 --> 36:58.048
That seems far-fetched.

36:58.148 --> 37:01.377
They could be serial killers
using the zombie apocalypse

37:01.477 --> 37:05.250
as an elaborate cover for murdering
everybody that comes here.

37:05.350 --> 37:08.887
Kind of defeats the point. It's already
apocalypse, so why be a serial killer?

37:08.987 --> 37:12.591
- Could be giant spiders.
- He makes a good point on the spiders...

37:12.891 --> 37:16.178
- You never know. You never know.
- ...so with that said, let's be on our toes,

37:16.278 --> 37:19.192
but be benevolent, be vigilant.

37:20.099 --> 37:22.371
Greetings, ladies and gentlemen,

37:22.771 --> 37:26.295
and welcome to the Safe Haven Ranch.

37:27.089 --> 37:30.876
Afternoon, sir. I can assure you
we're here to cause no trouble.

37:30.976 --> 37:32.168
I'm Sheriff Lincoln.

37:32.268 --> 37:36.708
Well, howdy there, Detective.
My name is Abraham.

37:37.648 --> 37:39.479
- Sheriff.
- Sheriff.

37:39.579 --> 37:41.754
That's quite a knife
you got there, Abraham.

37:42.720 --> 37:46.492
Don't mind old Betsy here.
She's just used in the barn.

37:46.992 --> 37:50.146
I was on my way there
when I saw y'all pull up.

37:50.246 --> 37:53.932
Hey, y'all thirsty?
My wife just made some Kool-Aid.

37:54.032 --> 37:55.685
Kool-Aid.

37:55.935 --> 38:00.273
Sarah, honey? Would you be so kind
as to bring out your special Kool-Aid?

38:00.373 --> 38:05.010
- We have visitors.
- I'm more a Hi-C guy myself, but let's go.

38:05.645 --> 38:07.213
Come on up to the house.

38:07.313 --> 38:10.199
God, oh, my God.
Crazy old man, knives, makes Kool-Aid.

38:10.299 --> 38:12.735
This is gonna be a bloodbath.

38:13.185 --> 38:16.322
We're completely isolated
from the dangers of the city.

38:16.422 --> 38:19.858
Untouched, nobody around for miles.

38:19.958 --> 38:23.022
You don't mind us asking,
how have you stayed infection-free?

38:23.122 --> 38:25.048
Well, we wash our hands.

38:25.148 --> 38:28.801
Although we have had an illness
in the family here recently.

38:28.901 --> 38:31.896
- Sarah, sweetie. All our guests have come.
- Oh, honey, hi.

38:32.196 --> 38:33.580
I was show...

38:33.839 --> 38:38.077
Well, hello. Welcome, everyone.
Such a big crowd we got here.

38:38.177 --> 38:42.531
- Yes, ma'am. Sorry to impose.
- Oh, it's no imposition. Don't be silly.

38:42.631 --> 38:45.251
We welcome everyone here with open arms.

38:45.551 --> 38:48.820
I just made some Kool-Aid.
Would you like some?

38:48.920 --> 38:51.199
- Green Bay here loves Kool-Aid.
- Oh, no, not...

38:51.299 --> 38:53.175
He loves that sweet,
sweet powdery drink.

38:53.275 --> 38:56.028
- No, you're thinking of Pixy Stix.
- Never seen you eat a Pixy Stix.

38:56.128 --> 38:59.995
Abraham, put that thing down.
People are gonna think we're crazy.

39:00.095 --> 39:02.774
- I forgot.
- Or crazier.

39:10.308 --> 39:12.225
You have a grandson?

39:12.325 --> 39:15.214
Good heavens, you make me feel old.

39:15.314 --> 39:17.383
No, that's our daughter, Isaac.

39:17.483 --> 39:20.602
Your daughter, Isaac?

39:20.752 --> 39:25.473
She made that before the illness,
long time ago.

39:31.096 --> 39:34.249
- She's real talented.
- So will y'all be joining us for dinner?

39:35.133 --> 39:37.696
It's gonna be good food.

39:39.505 --> 39:40.706
- Sure.
- Yeah.

39:40.806 --> 39:45.570
Excuse me, but... we don't allow
strangers to use this door.

39:46.061 --> 39:48.647
- Go around to the side, please.
- Of course.

39:49.047 --> 39:50.218
Okay.

39:50.318 --> 39:53.105
- We're gonna die.
- Hope they got beets.

39:53.205 --> 39:55.521
Yeah, we'll meet you around there.
It'll be easier.

39:55.621 --> 39:58.591
- I'll go get us another chicken.
- Oh, good idea. Good idea.

39:58.691 --> 40:01.036
Hustle it up, Romeo.

40:01.493 --> 40:04.347
Heavenly Father, we thank thee
for the abundance...

40:04.447 --> 40:07.533
<i>Dear Jesus, please don't let
Father Abraham notice my corpse fingers</i>

40:07.633 --> 40:12.272
<i>and realize that I am in fact dead.
Also, please make me human again. Amen.</i>

40:12.372 --> 40:16.375
...and for our guests,
may they find rest in their travels,

40:16.475 --> 40:21.213
and help us to find a pair of gloves
for this young man sitting next to me,

40:21.313 --> 40:24.120
- whose hand feels like dry ice.
- <i>Yikes.</i>

40:24.220 --> 40:27.352
Do you have anything
you would want to add, son?

40:28.002 --> 40:31.457
Thanks... for... the peas.

40:31.957 --> 40:36.255
- In Jesus' name, amen.
- Okay, everybody dig in.

40:39.832 --> 40:41.467
<i>Seriously?</i>

40:42.355 --> 40:45.471
Green Bay, dive on in.

40:45.771 --> 40:49.880
Oh, no, no, no. I insist, ma'am.
You first. Ladies first.

40:49.980 --> 40:53.423
Don't be absurd.
You're our guests. You're first.

41:18.519 --> 41:22.252
<i>Not that I would even know if I were being
poisoned, you know, being dead and all.</i>

41:24.543 --> 41:27.813
Well, Abraham, Sarah,
your daughter Isaac, she's...

41:27.913 --> 41:30.249
We'd rather not discuss her illness.

41:30.349 --> 41:33.986
We don't want you
to catch her... her bug.

41:34.086 --> 41:37.272
So, everybody, eat up.
Save room for dessert.

41:37.372 --> 41:41.079
I've got some special pie
with my secret ingredient.

41:41.459 --> 41:43.822
Sounds delicious.

41:49.801 --> 41:52.503
What is the... secret ingredient?

41:53.772 --> 41:55.708
I can't tell you that.

41:55.808 --> 41:58.578
If I do, then the whole neighborhood
will be putting in orders.

41:58.678 --> 42:03.516
Raw sugar. I'm only one
slice away from diabetes myself.

42:05.077 --> 42:07.887
I'm afraid some of you
might have to sleep on the floor.

42:07.987 --> 42:10.609
I don't think I have enough beds
and couches for everyone.

42:10.709 --> 42:11.957
It's quite all right, Sarah.

42:12.057 --> 42:15.394
We plan on making a camp outside
tonight. Thank you very much.

42:15.494 --> 42:18.056
Actually, shotgun guest bedroom
if it's available.

42:18.156 --> 42:19.565
You got it.

42:20.599 --> 42:22.835
- I have back issues. No.
- More like privacy issues.

42:22.935 --> 42:25.154
Wherever y'all decide
to sleep is fine with us.

42:25.254 --> 42:27.537
- Just make sure you clean up your mess.
- Nonsense.

42:27.637 --> 42:30.753
These hands have seen
every kind of mess there is.

43:00.372 --> 43:02.929
<i>To any living soul,
especially Selena Gomez,</i>

43:03.029 --> 43:06.157
<i>we have left this mall
in search of Safe Haven Ranch.</i>

43:07.646 --> 43:13.545
<i>Also, I've left my list
of my rules for survival.</i>

43:28.667 --> 43:31.737
So they're totally crazy, right?
Consensus on that?

43:31.837 --> 43:34.073
They are definitely hiding
something in there.

43:34.173 --> 43:37.368
Yeah, their daughter.

43:37.668 --> 43:42.648
Wouldn't be surprised if she's chained
to a bed, growing sludge.

43:42.748 --> 43:46.211
- They sure are nice people, aren't they?
- Yeah, they do seem to be.

43:47.886 --> 43:52.090
Rumor has it there's been people out there
like them waiting for the cure.

43:52.190 --> 43:54.092
I'd bet my bow on it.

43:54.192 --> 43:57.675
Not exactly a happy chip to play there,
Katniss, but point taken.

43:57.775 --> 44:00.792
And who exactly are you hearing
those rumors from?

44:01.999 --> 44:04.269
Guess you ain't never
heard of a tracker.

44:04.369 --> 44:07.759
They want us dead.
I can feel it. We need a plan.

44:07.859 --> 44:10.743
I just hope we made
a good first impression.

44:11.455 --> 44:15.281
Your little angel heart is incapable
of making a bad impression.

44:15.381 --> 44:17.616
Let's make a preemptive assault,
catch 'em in their sleep.

44:17.716 --> 44:21.820
Jesus, kid.
They're a combined 200 years old.

44:21.920 --> 44:24.806
We ain't gotta channel
SEAL Team Six or nothing.

44:24.906 --> 44:27.536
- <i>Felt that reference coming.</i>
- I think we should wait until the morning

44:27.636 --> 44:30.830
to do anything.
I could use a good night's sleep.

44:30.930 --> 44:34.834
Or at least a warm body
to share my sleeping bag with.

44:35.334 --> 44:38.938
<i>Half chub? I got a half chub. I'm alive!</i>

44:39.038 --> 44:40.806
I guess I'll go take first watch.

44:40.906 --> 44:43.476
There's nobody around here
worried about anything.

44:44.076 --> 44:46.778
I'm actually colder next to you.

44:46.878 --> 44:50.282
Those creepy old assholes try anything,
at least someone will be ready.

44:50.888 --> 44:53.625
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

44:59.324 --> 45:01.593
It's a good idea, Carl.

45:01.693 --> 45:05.164
- I'll stay up with you for a while.
- Chris.

45:05.764 --> 45:07.733
You can call me Dad, son.

45:08.033 --> 45:09.862
Get some sleep, Pops.

45:31.123 --> 45:32.276
Nope.

45:43.668 --> 45:47.882
Thank you for the hypothermia
and poison Kool-Aid, Father Abraham.

45:50.742 --> 45:54.846
- My hair gets poofy if I don't towel-dry.
- You smell like lilacs.

45:54.946 --> 45:57.516
Yeah, I do, because they infuse it
into their homemade soap.

45:57.616 --> 46:01.454
Enjoy smelling like homeless butthole
and sleeping on dirt, bitches.

46:01.954 --> 46:06.752
Kate Upton, I will paint
your body someday.

46:15.634 --> 46:17.329
Hello?

46:19.338 --> 46:21.258
Father Abraham?

46:23.442 --> 46:25.304
Sarah?

46:27.412 --> 46:29.108
Brooklyn?

46:57.474 --> 47:00.300
You guys hear that? Hey, wake up!

47:00.400 --> 47:03.148
- Dad? Wake up!
- Carl.

47:03.248 --> 47:05.217
Let's get in there
and save that little pussy.

47:05.517 --> 47:08.714
- Should we, though?
- Yeah, we should. Come on.

47:11.564 --> 47:13.085
Weird dude.

47:14.676 --> 47:17.629
- Rape!
- No, no, no, no, no! Stop it! Stop it!

47:17.729 --> 47:20.816
- Who are you?
- I'm a guest of your parents!

47:20.916 --> 47:23.135
My parents don't have guests.
Why are you here?

47:23.235 --> 47:26.404
We were traveling outside the city, and we
heard that your farm or ranch or whatever

47:26.504 --> 47:28.707
was a safe haven,
which it totally says that it is.

47:28.807 --> 47:31.143
I'm with, like, a huge group.
They have a camp outside.

47:31.243 --> 47:34.012
Did you not see them?
They have, like, a roaring campfire.

47:34.112 --> 47:37.215
- I have night blindness.
- Oh, my God, me, too.

47:37.315 --> 47:40.268
- Why are you inside?
- I have back issues.

47:40.368 --> 47:43.364
- Me, too.
- Really?

47:44.189 --> 47:46.792
Good God, dude!
Are you torqued right now?

47:46.892 --> 47:50.156
You're way hotter than I thought
you were gonna be and also not dead.

47:53.031 --> 47:54.033
What are you guys doing in here?

47:54.133 --> 47:57.068
We're here to save your ass
from that zombie bitch.

47:57.168 --> 47:59.358
- Don't say that word in here!
- Yeah, she's not a B.

47:59.458 --> 48:02.874
- No, the Z word.
- Why?

48:02.974 --> 48:05.811
My parents don't know
the world has turned to shit.

48:05.911 --> 48:08.980
- How is that possible?
- They never leave the property.

48:09.080 --> 48:12.385
They don't have a TV,
and they don't listen to the radio.

48:12.485 --> 48:15.821
I mean, I turn it on once a day
just to see if anything's changed.

48:16.521 --> 48:17.823
I love this song.

48:17.923 --> 48:22.261
- And you haven't told them, because...
- Have you seen how old they are?

48:22.361 --> 48:24.429
I mean, they would literally
have a heart attack

48:24.529 --> 48:27.165
if they knew they weren't
taken in by the Rapture.

48:27.265 --> 48:29.435
So where have you, like,
been this whole time?

48:29.535 --> 48:32.227
We totally thought
you were a zom... a Z.

48:32.751 --> 48:34.660
Your parents kept talking
about your "illness."

48:34.760 --> 48:37.436
I don't have an illness.
I just got into a little fight with them

48:37.536 --> 48:39.395
'cause they caught me smoking a ganj.

48:39.495 --> 48:41.016
With...

48:41.116 --> 48:42.811
with marijuana?

48:43.458 --> 48:47.619
Totally cool, tubular. Like, yeah.
Do that stuff all the time.

48:47.719 --> 48:51.673
I didn't used to. I mean, I just started
after I saw some of that shit.

48:51.773 --> 48:54.269
You can say that again, Janis.

48:57.762 --> 48:59.665
Joplin?

48:59.765 --> 49:03.468
I mean, if that reference is too young
for you, she was a huge stoner.

49:03.568 --> 49:06.138
- It ain't funny if you have to explain it.
- You get it.

49:06.238 --> 49:10.009
So your parents found out and shunned you
or something? That's pretty harsh.

49:10.109 --> 49:13.895
My parents are pretty old-fashioned. Staying
in the barn just keeps them off my back.

49:13.995 --> 49:16.498
How long are you guys
planning on staying?

49:17.021 --> 49:18.060
We hadn't really...

49:18.160 --> 49:21.972
We kind of thought that your parents
were crazy killers hiding Z...

49:22.072 --> 49:24.770
Zom... Z's, so...

49:24.870 --> 49:26.350
Sorry I freaked you out.

49:26.450 --> 49:30.379
You probably thought I was some,
like, zombie rapist or s...

49:30.879 --> 49:35.734
- The scummiest of all the Z-words.
- Right. Only living rape for me.

49:36.644 --> 49:38.507
- Cut and run, kid.
- That was a joke.

49:38.607 --> 49:42.341
I would never... Like, rape is bad.
I'm not a raper... rapist.

49:42.441 --> 49:45.910
I would never... I haven't even...
You know what? I'm gonna go ahead and...

49:46.402 --> 49:47.706
never recovering from that one.

50:01.459 --> 50:04.964
- Good morning, everybody.
- Morning.

50:05.164 --> 50:08.967
I just wanted to thank you for being
the biggest cock-block ever last night!

50:09.067 --> 50:11.970
I'm sorry, princess.
Hey, did you say your prayers?

50:12.220 --> 50:14.189
Yeah, always. I assume you didn't.

50:14.439 --> 50:16.875
Kind of explains your attitude
towards life and everything.

50:16.975 --> 50:18.746
- Tea bag?
- Oh, my God.

50:18.846 --> 50:19.944
Nope.

50:20.044 --> 50:23.248
- Well, good morning, everyone.
- Morning, Abraham.

50:24.148 --> 50:26.485
Still got his toys, I see.

50:26.585 --> 50:30.155
Well, this looks like the beginning
of another beautiful day,

50:30.255 --> 50:32.824
another blessing from our God in heaven.

50:32.924 --> 50:36.261
We would like to introduce you
to our daughter Isaac.

50:36.361 --> 50:38.663
She's feeling better,
and she wanted to meet you.

50:38.763 --> 50:40.733
What's up, everybody? Nice day.

50:40.833 --> 50:43.535
Hi. So very nice to meet you
for the first time ever.

50:44.654 --> 50:48.268
Y'all are welcome to stay for as long
as you like, but if you're going to,

50:48.368 --> 50:52.158
I'd like to ask you if you could
kind of help out around here a little.

50:52.258 --> 50:56.648
My back's beginning to feel its age,
and, of course, Isaac is a little limited,

50:56.748 --> 51:00.017
- being a woman and all.
- He's right. My place is in the kitchen.

51:00.417 --> 51:03.922
We're more than happy to help out, Abraham.
Whatever we gotta do to earn our keep.

51:04.222 --> 51:06.959
Actually, we could use quite
a bit of help sowing our oats

51:07.059 --> 51:08.894
and gathering up brush and firewood.

51:08.994 --> 51:12.934
Lucky for you, I am very good
at sowing my own oats.

51:13.034 --> 51:15.995
- Oh, that's great.
- Tea bag?

51:17.168 --> 51:19.971
I always liked this better as a parable.

51:20.871 --> 51:25.727
Yeah, well... at least we're not running
from brain-thirsty a-holes.

51:25.827 --> 51:28.513
You can't be brain-thirsty.
You don't drink brains, idiot!

51:28.613 --> 51:30.565
Ease up on the kid, Brook.

51:30.665 --> 51:34.386
I'm sure you can squeeze
some juice from a nice ripe brain.

51:34.486 --> 51:38.089
Clearly you're unaware of his supreme
ability to be a huge little bitch.

51:38.189 --> 51:41.993
Well, he seems manly enough to me.
He can sow his oats like a pro.

51:42.093 --> 51:44.677
Prepare for disappointment
when it comes to shooting off on time

51:44.777 --> 51:46.060
or in the right direction.

51:46.160 --> 51:50.632
You seem especially gritchy today,
Brooklyn. You stressed?

51:51.002 --> 51:54.739
- Need a release?
- Not if you have anything to do with it.

51:54.839 --> 51:58.677
I think I can help. I do know a place
that can be a great stress relief.

51:59.466 --> 52:03.448
- I ain't opposed. Romeo?
- I'm... super stressed.

52:03.548 --> 52:05.357
Whatever it is, I'm in.

52:10.422 --> 52:12.590
Welcome to my stress ball.

52:13.758 --> 52:15.454
Come on in.

52:36.531 --> 52:39.108
- Not what I expected.
- Impressed, though.

52:39.208 --> 52:41.446
Props, farm girl.

52:42.187 --> 52:45.718
I... prefer... meth.

52:47.725 --> 52:49.354
Kidding.

52:50.261 --> 52:52.397
I... yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:52.497 --> 52:57.617
Yeah, I definitely always... always...
always prefer to... to... to...

52:57.867 --> 53:02.742
to relieve stress, like... with...
with that... with... with drugs.

53:02.842 --> 53:05.371
It's... it's my... thing.

53:06.811 --> 53:08.507
Yeah?

53:09.281 --> 53:12.072
- What you got in there?
- It's my own special blend.

53:12.172 --> 53:15.120
I call it Hash of the Living Dead.

53:15.220 --> 53:16.779
That's actually kind of creative.

53:23.994 --> 53:27.254
Holy shit.

53:28.616 --> 53:32.504
<i>If I had a working brain,
I'm sure this would be awesome.</i>

53:32.604 --> 53:35.000
Jesus, let me help you, brother.

53:39.710 --> 53:43.149
I shall call you Lebong James.

53:52.991 --> 53:56.021
All right, nobody touch me.
I'm gonna get weird.

54:02.266 --> 54:06.036
No one's, like...
like, died from this, right? It's...

54:06.160 --> 54:11.553
- Dude, don't bogart that bong.
- Let's try secondhand the first time.

54:20.252 --> 54:22.787
No. Bad idea. Good God.

54:23.087 --> 54:25.551
It... it...

54:27.791 --> 54:32.499
It's like... it's...
the world is kind of...

54:33.169 --> 54:36.501
- It's, like, swirly.
- Swirly? Yeah.

54:36.601 --> 54:40.005
It's like... kind of like fro-yo when you do
the two mix. Know what I mean?

54:40.105 --> 54:43.141
- Frozen yogurt.
- Oh, my God.

54:43.241 --> 54:45.778
I want fro-yo so bad right now.

54:45.878 --> 54:47.730
Yeah.

54:49.046 --> 54:53.337
Feel like I'm in a...
giant womb of skin suits.

55:21.346 --> 55:24.215
That sounded so cool.

55:24.615 --> 55:26.840
Like angels clapping.

55:31.455 --> 55:34.607
Pretty sounds make me happy.

56:10.094 --> 56:14.125
<i>Weird. Didn't know you could
hallucinate on the ganj.</i>

56:18.904 --> 56:21.557
<i>This is actually the clearest
my mind has been in weeks.</i>

56:24.158 --> 56:28.123
<i>My least favorite thing
in the entire world is a Twinkie.</i>

56:30.381 --> 56:33.151
<i>Hate Twinkies. Twinkies. Hate Twinkies.</i>

56:33.551 --> 56:35.053
Where's Green Boy?

56:47.131 --> 56:50.601
Symphonious calamity!

57:36.898 --> 57:41.629
Guaranteed A-Rod, McGwire, the Rock,
all survived 'cause of steroids.

57:42.954 --> 57:45.683
- What the hell was that?
- Obviously fireworks, dipshit.

57:54.365 --> 57:57.362
Okay, that was at the barn. Let's go.

58:08.045 --> 58:12.217
Holy F-word S-word.
Did you guys see those fireworks?

58:12.317 --> 58:14.018
Stress relieved.

58:14.118 --> 58:18.977
Damn, kid. If I am not in love
with you right now...

58:20.291 --> 58:23.461
That... shit was dope, Green Man.

58:23.561 --> 58:26.231
I was just doing me, man, just doing me.

58:26.331 --> 58:27.565
Do you.

58:27.665 --> 58:30.134
What was that? Warning shot?

58:30.234 --> 58:32.137
- You been infected?
- Answer!

58:32.237 --> 58:35.273
Dude, we're just baked.

58:35.373 --> 58:36.920
Hey!

58:37.020 --> 58:41.343
Enough with the violence, Chris. I mean,
did Mandela's death mean nothing?

58:41.443 --> 58:43.381
Tupac and Biggie nothing?

58:43.481 --> 58:45.860
Can't we just find some kind
of peaceful resolution?

58:45.960 --> 58:49.738
What in the name of seventh heaven
have you done?

58:49.838 --> 58:54.575
Don't you know we're under severe
water restrictions and fire warnings?

58:54.725 --> 58:59.063
- This drought is serious!
- That was, like, 15 years ago.

58:59.163 --> 59:03.434
Well, I guess it's about time to renew
our newspaper subscription.

59:03.534 --> 59:05.203
I'll go into town tomorrow.

59:05.303 --> 59:08.273
- You have any idea how loud that was?
- I dunno.

59:08.373 --> 59:10.442
That must have been audible for miles.

59:10.542 --> 59:13.571
Oh, my God. You guys saw
those pretty sky flowers, too?

59:14.345 --> 59:17.798
Isaac, what is wrong with you?

59:18.049 --> 59:20.384
You look like you've been doing drugs.

59:20.484 --> 59:24.475
Mother, trust me. We totally have.

59:25.257 --> 59:30.361
Suuuuper-duper stoned.

59:30.461 --> 59:34.031
For the record, I will say it.
It was awesome.

59:34.131 --> 59:38.102
Kids still shouldn't do it.
Just a little PSA for you two lovebirds.

59:38.202 --> 59:40.070
I see that chemistry, though.

59:40.170 --> 59:42.808
Isaac, this is not okay!

59:42.908 --> 59:45.550
- Who the hell is that?
- Where? What...

59:45.650 --> 59:47.879
It looks like old Hank,
our next-farm neighbor.

59:47.979 --> 59:51.282
He sure is walking funny.
You all right there, Hank?

59:51.382 --> 59:53.314
He ain't all right. Let me do him.

59:54.885 --> 59:57.528
Why are you playing with a child's toy?

59:57.628 --> 01:00:00.858
We've actually been wondering that
for, like, a real long time.

01:00:01.358 --> 01:00:03.627
Hey! Like you should talk.

01:00:03.727 --> 01:00:06.130
Shooting contest, you and me, right now!

01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:09.800
Oh, Jesus. That'd be like
watching a WNBA game.

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:13.038
No, Hank! No!

01:00:13.138 --> 01:00:15.040
Son, you know what you just did?

01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:18.142
I just killed a zombie that was about
to rip your leg off, you crazy old man.

01:00:18.242 --> 01:00:21.011
Hey! Carl! Show some respect.

01:00:21.111 --> 01:00:24.248
- What's a zambie?
- A zombie.

01:00:24.348 --> 01:00:28.219
Everyone outside this farm
has been infected by a crazy virus.

01:00:28.319 --> 01:00:32.123
- People are eating each other out there.
- And my buzz is completely gone.

01:00:32.523 --> 01:00:35.025
- Thank you, Hank.
- God rest his soul!

01:00:35.125 --> 01:00:38.073
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.
This can't be.

01:00:38.173 --> 01:00:40.269
I just found out myself,

01:00:40.369 --> 01:00:43.735
came out of a coma a couple days ago.
Whole world was gone.

01:00:43.835 --> 01:00:46.804
Isaac, why have you kept this from us?

01:00:46.904 --> 01:00:49.173
I'm sorry. I didn't want to tell you,
'cause I thought...

01:00:49.273 --> 01:00:51.059
She thought it'd be
too much for you to take.

01:00:51.159 --> 01:00:56.380
I can't believe that you're doing drugs!

01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:59.017
Oh, God, forgive us!

01:00:59.117 --> 01:01:01.152
We have failed as parents!

01:01:01.252 --> 01:01:05.122
Mother, Papa, I am so, so sorry.

01:01:05.222 --> 01:01:09.293
Did they not hear the whole
zombie apocalypse thing or...

01:01:09.393 --> 01:01:13.031
- That's some pretty selective hearing.
- Sucks for your girlfriend.

01:01:13.531 --> 01:01:17.166
Oh, my God. Will you quit that shit
for five seconds?

01:01:17.271 --> 01:01:20.854
I'm sorry I'm not Rambo, and I wasn't
prepared for the freaking zombie apocalypse

01:01:20.954 --> 01:01:24.542
like everybody else apparently was.
Yeah, I can't shoot. I'm sorry.

01:01:24.642 --> 01:01:27.898
Get off my back! You and your sister
are complete assholes!

01:01:27.998 --> 01:01:31.266
The only reason that we keep you around
is because you're hot, and she's a child!

01:01:31.366 --> 01:01:33.517
I'm a teenager, fart face!

01:01:33.617 --> 01:01:36.265
Swear to Christ, little girl.
If you open your mouth one more time,

01:01:36.365 --> 01:01:40.551
I will rip that zombie's jaw off
and sink its teeth into your neck!

01:01:41.926 --> 01:01:46.233
Wait. Did you just talk? I thought you were,
like, too traumatized to speak, or...

01:01:46.333 --> 01:01:47.799
She was a mute.

01:01:48.099 --> 01:01:50.935
- Use a real weapon, damn it!
- That's how walkers talk.

01:01:51.035 --> 01:01:53.943
She's deaf, you mega asshole...

01:01:54.043 --> 01:01:57.332
cowboy asshole, dipshit little bitch!

01:01:57.774 --> 01:02:01.212
How have you guys not noticed?
Are you all that self-absorbed?

01:02:01.702 --> 01:02:04.648
- How does she know what we're saying then?
- She can read lips, you idiot!

01:02:04.748 --> 01:02:07.351
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Everyone calm down!

01:02:08.116 --> 01:02:12.223
- Whatever, man. This is freaking bullshit.
- So what's the plan, Sheriff?

01:02:23.534 --> 01:02:26.970
I mean, I thought this was some kind
of a diaphragm or whatever.

01:02:27.070 --> 01:02:27.955
Di-archy.

01:02:28.055 --> 01:02:30.341
You just got high with a bunch
of college-age kids.

01:02:30.441 --> 01:02:32.410
I don't respect your opinion
as a leader anymore.

01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:36.780
Hey, hey, hey, Carl!
That's enough! That's enough!

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:39.977
We're losing our humanity here?

01:02:40.884 --> 01:02:44.155
Let's take a page
out of Romeo's playbook.

01:02:44.255 --> 01:02:45.523
Keep it calm.

01:02:45.923 --> 01:02:47.324
Fine.

01:02:47.424 --> 01:02:51.929
Sheriff, I guess you're the sheriff now.

01:02:52.029 --> 01:02:54.832
- I always was.
- Fine, Chief.

01:02:54.932 --> 01:02:56.827
Sheriff.

01:02:58.169 --> 01:03:00.295
And why don't you...

01:03:00.395 --> 01:03:05.601
get your goddamn Kid Rock,
Kenny Chesney, poser-ass hat

01:03:05.701 --> 01:03:07.939
off my Stetson?

01:03:17.922 --> 01:03:22.238
All right, listen up. I said listen up!

01:03:23.861 --> 01:03:26.408
Do I have your attention now?

01:03:29.833 --> 01:03:33.279
Everyone look away! Look away!

01:03:34.539 --> 01:03:36.780
All right, look back!

01:03:44.715 --> 01:03:47.985
Now, obviously this place
isn't untouched anymore.

01:03:48.085 --> 01:03:51.556
Right? It's just a matter of time
before that fence is breached.

01:03:51.656 --> 01:03:52.923
They will swarm.

01:03:53.423 --> 01:03:56.294
The way I see it is we got two choices.

01:03:56.394 --> 01:04:01.733
One, we could do the smart thing
and run like the pussies we are.

01:04:02.433 --> 01:04:05.936
Or we could stand our ground and protect
these sweet, innocent old people

01:04:06.036 --> 01:04:08.204
and their hot stoner daughter

01:04:08.304 --> 01:04:13.012
from the infection and the inevitable
invasion of the walking dead

01:04:13.112 --> 01:04:16.087
and the living dead
and all sorts of dead,

01:04:16.187 --> 01:04:21.302
which we may or may not have
brought here through stoner fireworks.

01:04:21.402 --> 01:04:24.345
I'm all for battle, but us versus
a town full of zombies,

01:04:24.445 --> 01:04:27.942
- that sounds pretty damn stupid.
- Then there it is. We stay.

01:04:28.042 --> 01:04:30.527
I mean, it is our fault
that they're getting through, so...

01:04:30.627 --> 01:04:34.932
Was I the one baked and going all
Fourth of July out in this janky barn?

01:04:35.032 --> 01:04:37.968
Oh, wait, no. No, that was you guys.

01:04:38.068 --> 01:04:40.965
Where the hell is little Romeo, anyway?

01:04:42.056 --> 01:04:45.642
Not you, stroke face.
Green Bay. Where's Green Bay?

01:04:45.742 --> 01:04:50.047
- Looking... for girl.
- Well, go find him then.

01:04:50.147 --> 01:04:52.543
He's just making it worse.

01:04:52.917 --> 01:04:55.012
Take your time, buddy.

01:04:56.620 --> 01:04:58.850
All right, spread out.

01:04:59.557 --> 01:05:01.692
Do something official.

01:05:01.792 --> 01:05:03.859
I'm gonna look for...

01:05:04.359 --> 01:05:06.557
any evidence of...

01:05:07.188 --> 01:05:09.066
I'm looking for a roach.

01:05:15.673 --> 01:05:18.476
<i>Oh, boy. I know exactly
where this is going.</i>

01:05:18.576 --> 01:05:22.847
- Hey... where's your girl?
- Man, I don't know how to get to her.

01:05:22.947 --> 01:05:25.282
I mean, I know girls
want their space or whatever,

01:05:25.382 --> 01:05:27.852
but I gotta get inside somehow.

01:05:27.952 --> 01:05:29.920
I can't go to her parents. They hate me.

01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:32.890
I know... what to do.

01:05:36.794 --> 01:05:39.376
Right. I'm gonna just knock. That's...

01:05:39.476 --> 01:05:40.932
God!

01:05:41.032 --> 01:05:42.561
Dude.

01:05:47.538 --> 01:05:49.640
- What the hell?
- Hey, Isaac.

01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:52.354
Dude, uncool. If you break the window,

01:05:52.454 --> 01:05:55.380
I'm gonna get blamed for it,
and I'm already in deep shit.

01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:57.214
It... was me.

01:05:57.314 --> 01:05:59.017
What's your name again?

01:05:59.117 --> 01:06:02.013
- Romeo.
- Romero? Like George?

01:06:02.113 --> 01:06:06.457
- No. Romeo, like...
- You're kidding me. That's even better.

01:06:06.657 --> 01:06:10.628
Yes, not kidding. Okay, one,
sorry I disturbed your peace. My bad.

01:06:10.728 --> 01:06:13.478
Two, we have a pretty
looming problem out here.

01:06:13.578 --> 01:06:17.535
The portal in the fence that's letting
dead people in? Haven't forgot about that.

01:06:17.635 --> 01:06:21.538
- We're staying... to help fight.
- Okay. Now get me out of here.

01:06:21.638 --> 01:06:26.143
But, see, I'd rather you stay inside,
like away from... safe.

01:06:26.243 --> 01:06:28.122
<i>Can't this bitch
just sneak out the window?</i>

01:06:28.222 --> 01:06:31.676
Okay, okay. On it. Just...

01:06:36.052 --> 01:06:38.522
Too... awkward.

01:06:38.722 --> 01:06:40.418
Agreed.

01:06:52.970 --> 01:06:54.138
What do you want, son?

01:06:54.238 --> 01:06:57.245
You and your friends are no longer
welcome in this beautiful home

01:06:57.345 --> 01:06:59.860
that my grandfather built
with his own two hands,

01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:04.332
that I restored into the lovely summer
cottage that you're looking at before you.

01:07:04.432 --> 01:07:07.304
When this is all over with, you should
start a bed-and-breakfast, but...

01:07:07.404 --> 01:07:10.094
these zombies, they're coming.
They're rabid. They don't stop.

01:07:13.113 --> 01:07:16.560
You guys can survive a little while in here,
but eventually you're gonna need supplies.

01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:19.399
We can fix the fence.
By the way, that was Hank's fault.

01:07:19.499 --> 01:07:22.861
We can do everything we can out here
to hold them off, but we need Isaac.

01:07:24.635 --> 01:07:28.972
What part of "no" do you not understand?

01:07:29.072 --> 01:07:30.608
She's in enough trouble as it is.

01:07:30.708 --> 01:07:33.944
You and your people haven't
exactly been a good influence on her.

01:07:34.044 --> 01:07:36.874
Look, sir, we gotta go. There's no time.

01:07:37.982 --> 01:07:43.454
This is literally life or death. All I need
is five minutes, just five minutes.

01:07:43.554 --> 01:07:45.889
10 minutes, that's all you get.

01:07:46.589 --> 01:07:48.542
- Okay?
- Okay, yeah. That sounds good.

01:07:48.642 --> 01:07:50.711
Just a minute.

01:07:51.061 --> 01:07:53.351
What's the password?

01:07:54.251 --> 01:07:58.469
Is it... Father Abraham had many sons

01:07:58.569 --> 01:08:02.467
And many sons had Father Abraham?

01:08:06.410 --> 01:08:08.639
You may pass.

01:08:10.948 --> 01:08:13.740
Isaac? Isaac, are you decent?

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:17.955
No. I've gotten completely naked
since we last talked.

01:08:18.255 --> 01:08:20.390
- Okay.
- I was being sarcastic.

01:08:20.490 --> 01:08:23.319
- I know. Okay. Let's go.
- Okay.

01:08:30.399 --> 01:08:36.407
Heavenly Father, just as you protected
David against Goliath, watch over us.

01:08:36.506 --> 01:08:40.010
- Help us to rise up with strength.
- Yes, Father.

01:08:40.109 --> 01:08:43.814
- We will fight with all we can.
- Hell, yeah.

01:08:43.915 --> 01:08:50.287
And please speak to Isaac's heart
about her irresponsible use of marijuana.

01:08:50.388 --> 01:08:53.240
- Please, God.
- In Jesus' name, amen.

01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:54.658
Amen.

01:08:54.758 --> 01:08:57.788
All right, I say we head out
to the west side, check that out first.

01:09:21.084 --> 01:09:23.321
Carl, binoculars.

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:24.988
Chris.

01:09:25.087 --> 01:09:27.191
Yeah, there they are just waiting.

01:09:27.291 --> 01:09:30.694
Better to fight 'em here in the trees.
We should draw 'em here to us.

01:09:30.795 --> 01:09:33.731
So just let them charge us
like a Civil War battle?

01:09:33.831 --> 01:09:37.368
They got teeth. We got guns.

01:09:37.468 --> 01:09:39.264
And Darnell's shooty thingy.

01:09:42.404 --> 01:09:45.910
- So you can't shoot?
- I mean, I can shoot.

01:09:46.010 --> 01:09:49.045
- Just most of the time, you miss.
- Yeah, that's the gist of it.

01:09:49.245 --> 01:09:52.100
These living-dead douche bags
are easier to kill than you think.

01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:53.197
How's that?

01:09:53.296 --> 01:09:55.920
Well, for some reason,
their skulls are super soft.

01:09:56.020 --> 01:09:58.422
I mean, I'm talking newborn-baby soft.

01:09:58.522 --> 01:10:02.878
Guns are guns, but I guess there's more
than one way to kill the living dead.

01:10:02.978 --> 01:10:04.759
Extremely convenient.

01:10:04.859 --> 01:10:06.775
That is true.

01:10:08.833 --> 01:10:10.868
Let's draw them in.

01:10:10.968 --> 01:10:14.305
Hey! Hey! Over here!

01:10:14.405 --> 01:10:16.539
Look at my neck!

01:10:16.639 --> 01:10:18.958
You want to bite this?

01:10:25.282 --> 01:10:26.977
Hey!

01:10:30.655 --> 01:10:33.391
- You guys ready?
- No. I'm out of bullets.

01:10:33.491 --> 01:10:35.756
Shit. All right, reload, reload!

01:10:35.856 --> 01:10:37.493
Damn it!

01:10:39.161 --> 01:10:40.765
All right.

01:10:40.865 --> 01:10:43.823
Let's do it! Yeah!

01:10:50.951 --> 01:10:52.510
<i>You should try inner monologue.</i>

01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:55.486
<i>It'd be really great
to actually hear your voice.</i>

01:11:03.585 --> 01:11:05.663
What was that?

01:11:06.423 --> 01:11:09.610
- It's coming from the porch.
- Oh, my God! The stoners are here!

01:11:09.710 --> 01:11:14.364
- What are they doing here?
- Sarah, be quiet. You'll attract more.

01:11:14.464 --> 01:11:18.402
They probably smell your stew,
and it's giving them the whatchamacallits.

01:11:18.502 --> 01:11:20.381
Munchies, Father.

01:11:20.481 --> 01:11:23.073
- Take Mom to my old room.
- I am not leaving you here.

01:11:23.173 --> 01:11:25.299
Damn it, Dad! Take her to my old room!

01:11:27.478 --> 01:11:29.179
You watch your language, young lady.

01:11:29.279 --> 01:11:32.297
Hey, we can take these assholes.

01:11:32.397 --> 01:11:36.146
Yeah, and you can do it without a gun.

01:11:37.488 --> 01:11:39.817
- Soft skulls, you say?
- The softest.

01:12:02.312 --> 01:12:03.774
Check this.

01:12:06.850 --> 01:12:09.113
Awesome. Oh, shit.

01:12:24.033 --> 01:12:25.503
I got an idea.

01:12:26.203 --> 01:12:27.449
Nickelback!

01:12:30.007 --> 01:12:31.174
What?

01:12:31.274 --> 01:12:35.073
They make me want to blow my brains out.
Figured it might do the trick. Come on.

01:12:40.951 --> 01:12:43.648
- Suck it!
- Yes!

01:12:45.623 --> 01:12:47.391
Wait.

01:12:47.491 --> 01:12:53.115
Hey, handsome... "Cloud Atlas,"
"Inception," and "Pan." Explain.

01:12:55.699 --> 01:12:57.346
That was awesome.

01:12:58.435 --> 01:13:00.303
Isaac? Isaac?

01:13:00.403 --> 01:13:03.373
Come to your old bedroom,
which is now the guest room! Now!

01:13:03.473 --> 01:13:05.409
Oh, shit. I bet they found my old bong.

01:13:05.509 --> 01:13:06.944
- Or my magazine.
- Come on!

01:13:07.642 --> 01:13:12.055
<i>If you haven't heard already, the world's
top scientists have finally found a cure</i>

01:13:12.155 --> 01:13:15.051
<i>for the disease and have released it
into the water supply.</i>

01:13:15.151 --> 01:13:17.655
<i>Pretty obvious solution.
Surprised nobody thought of it before.</i>

01:13:17.755 --> 01:13:22.360
<i>Anyway, the President released a statement
urging everyone to turn their sprinklers on.</i>

01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:25.856
<i>Meanwhile, there's still no cure
for Miley Cyrus.</i>

01:13:28.048 --> 01:13:31.361
- Hey! Hey, come on!
- Hey!

01:13:34.437 --> 01:13:36.099
Hey!

01:13:44.147 --> 01:13:46.042
I got him.

01:13:48.618 --> 01:13:51.289
No, I got him. I got him. I got him.

01:13:51.389 --> 01:13:55.026
Oh, hell, yeah.
I was only five feet away that time.

01:13:55.126 --> 01:13:58.375
For the love of God, man, use a gun.

01:14:02.899 --> 01:14:05.462
Hey, that's that wanderer guy!

01:14:06.003 --> 01:14:09.259
- I told you the rumors were true.
- Then why the hell'd you shoot him?

01:14:11.690 --> 01:14:14.277
Oh, shi... oh, shit.

01:14:16.413 --> 01:14:19.383
I was... I was just loading
the thing. I mean...

01:14:19.483 --> 01:14:23.821
- It was already loaded!
- I know that now, Captain Obviouses!

01:14:23.921 --> 01:14:27.177
Yeah. That's why I use this.

01:14:27.277 --> 01:14:29.425
Darnell, what the hell you doing?

01:14:29.631 --> 01:14:32.229
- Go getting my arrows.
- You got 20 in your fanny pack!

01:14:32.329 --> 01:14:34.805
God damn it, would you get off me?
I just murdered a man.

01:14:35.065 --> 01:14:36.236
Look out!

01:14:39.303 --> 01:14:40.598
Oh, my God!

01:14:42.572 --> 01:14:44.588
No!

01:14:45.802 --> 01:14:47.871
Carl, take the shot if you got one.
I ain't got one!

01:14:47.971 --> 01:14:50.654
My fucking name is Chris!

01:14:51.148 --> 01:14:52.577
Oh, my God!

01:15:00.457 --> 01:15:02.346
Save me. You can amputate it.

01:15:07.864 --> 01:15:10.300
Holy shit. That was hot.

01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:13.170
Guys, guys, come back to the house!
Come back to the house!

01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:14.942
Don't have to tell me again.

01:15:17.073 --> 01:15:18.936
Come on.

01:15:22.613 --> 01:15:26.184
- <i>God, finally.</i>
- It's inevitable, isn't it?

01:15:27.084 --> 01:15:29.018
<i>I wonder how the blood flow
is down there.</i>

01:15:29.718 --> 01:15:33.357
- I want to be with you forever.
- <i>I'm sorry. What?</i>

01:15:33.457 --> 01:15:37.342
Our love... will bind us for eternity.

01:15:37.442 --> 01:15:41.365
<i>Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
How do I get out of this?</i>

01:15:41.465 --> 01:15:43.308
Bite me...

01:15:43.945 --> 01:15:45.768
hard.

01:15:46.536 --> 01:15:48.875
<i>Oh, thank God.</i>

01:15:53.509 --> 01:15:57.413
- <i>That was easy.</i>
- Now we can be dead together.

01:15:58.266 --> 01:16:00.462
I can't wait to tell Harlem.

01:16:00.562 --> 01:16:02.885
- What's going on?
- What's going on with the feathers?

01:16:02.985 --> 01:16:04.851
- I'll explain those later.
- Chicken zombies?

01:16:04.951 --> 01:16:06.556
- Hey, guys! Guess what?
- What?

01:16:06.656 --> 01:16:09.125
- Romeo and I are together.
- That's news.

01:16:09.225 --> 01:16:11.812
Whatever that means.
Look, they found a cure.

01:16:11.912 --> 01:16:13.518
- What?
- No bullshit.

01:16:13.618 --> 01:16:16.149
They confirmed it last week.
They dumped the cure in the water.

01:16:16.249 --> 01:16:19.500
It cures zombies on contact,
gets in through their bites,

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:21.521
through their sores,
any open wounds they might have.

01:16:21.621 --> 01:16:23.908
- Butthole?
- What? Really?

01:16:24.008 --> 01:16:25.776
<i>And here I thought love
was making me human.</i>

01:16:25.876 --> 01:16:29.012
- Apparently it hurts like a son of a bitch...
- Anything in the butthole does.

01:16:29.112 --> 01:16:31.932
You regain consciousness. You're coming
alive. Who can complain about that?

01:16:32.032 --> 01:16:33.299
Damn it!

01:16:33.449 --> 01:16:37.161
So basically we just wait here
till they come by, and then we douse 'em.

01:16:37.261 --> 01:16:39.956
<i>I'm gonna go ahead and test this theory.</i>

01:16:40.056 --> 01:16:41.300
<i>Yep, it stings.</i>

01:16:41.658 --> 01:16:45.996
You branded yourself? That's like
the sexiest, most hard-ass thing ever!

01:16:46.296 --> 01:16:48.865
<i>Well, that was the worst cover-up
I've ever heard.</i>

01:16:48.965 --> 01:16:52.669
- You totally knew.
- Branded, my ass. You been bit. When?

01:16:52.769 --> 01:16:56.339
- <i>About three weeks ago.</i>
- Wait. This whole time?

01:16:56.439 --> 01:17:00.404
- You been a zombie this whole time?
- You been deaf this whole time?

01:17:02.012 --> 01:17:04.380
- Good God.
- And you, too!

01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:06.269
No. Mine just happened
a few minutes ago.

01:17:06.369 --> 01:17:09.857
- Anyone else?
- Holy shit, that's unpleasant!

01:17:09.957 --> 01:17:12.309
Oh, my God!
Can I go back to being a zombie?

01:17:12.409 --> 01:17:13.911
Matching bites. That's cute.

01:17:14.061 --> 01:17:16.736
I can't believe I didn't realize
you were a zombie until just now.

01:17:16.836 --> 01:17:19.382
I guess I was just blinded
by how panty-melting hot you are.

01:17:20.182 --> 01:17:23.287
You're very hot, too.
Wanted to tell you that for a while.

01:17:23.587 --> 01:17:26.090
You're a super bitch,
but you're also super hot.

01:17:26.938 --> 01:17:29.953
We got company. Spray lead.

01:18:27.950 --> 01:18:31.254
What the hell are you doing?
They're better.

01:18:57.747 --> 01:19:00.851
Damn, girl.
Let me holler at you for a sec.

01:19:00.951 --> 01:19:03.653
You make those healing legs
look hella good.

01:19:03.753 --> 01:19:08.418
Yeah. I swear, Green Bay,
if you cock-block me right now, I will...

01:19:10.626 --> 01:19:14.031
My man. "Penthouse"? "Playboy"?

01:19:14.131 --> 01:19:17.100
"Maxim"? Swimsuit edition?
Freaking L.L. Bean? What?

01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:20.903
- God bless, you are desperate. No.
- God damn!

01:19:21.003 --> 01:19:25.943
Yeah, the Reaganites had a huge porn stash
in their bedside table. Come on, dude.

01:19:26.043 --> 01:19:28.211
I jacked one of Isaac's
birth-control pills,

01:19:28.311 --> 01:19:32.014
antifungal cream for whatever
disgusting zombie STD she's carrying,

01:19:32.114 --> 01:19:36.787
and a pocket bible for when you realize
just how badly you need Jesus.

01:19:38.154 --> 01:19:40.826
And there's a Coldwater Creek
from, like, 1972 in the bathroom

01:19:40.926 --> 01:19:43.460
if you really have to go that far.

01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:46.396
- You brought me birth control, kid?
- I got you.

01:19:46.496 --> 01:19:48.467
Love you, bro.

01:19:50.533 --> 01:19:53.697
All right. Now why don't you show me
where you got bit?

01:19:55.538 --> 01:19:58.040
I think I might be married.

01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:00.911
I only run from the words
"I think I might be..."

01:20:01.011 --> 01:20:03.346
that's followed by the word "pregnant."

01:20:03.446 --> 01:20:05.942
Now let's get that blood flowing.

01:20:07.751 --> 01:20:09.864
Don't be afraid to make
the first move, son.

01:20:09.964 --> 01:20:12.723
And I know you're beyond your years,
but you're still a kid,

01:20:12.823 --> 01:20:15.109
so go ahead and give her a kiss.

01:20:15.209 --> 01:20:18.528
- I love you, Chris.
- Love you too, Pops.

01:20:18.928 --> 01:20:22.217
- Sorry for almost killing you and...
- It's okay.

01:20:22.317 --> 01:20:24.801
- ...killing Mom.
- Well, she was a bitch.

01:20:24.901 --> 01:20:29.098
- I'm gonna have some issues.
- Yes, you will. Yes, you will.

01:20:31.307 --> 01:20:33.637
What'd you do to your hair?

01:20:39.282 --> 01:20:42.803
There you are, sweetie.
Oh, give me a hug.

01:20:42.903 --> 01:20:45.455
- Good to see you, too.
- Oh, my sweet girl.

01:20:45.555 --> 01:20:48.418
- I love you, Mom.
- Love you, too, honey.

01:20:48.792 --> 01:20:51.861
- Let's go to my room.
- To the barn?

01:20:51.961 --> 01:20:54.665
No. Haven't you heard?
I moved back in with my parents.

01:20:54.765 --> 01:20:58.268
- So embarrassing.
- Hey, just blame it on the economy.

01:20:58.368 --> 01:21:01.304
- That's what I do every single time.
- Come on.

01:21:09.312 --> 01:21:12.559
- We have to get this off. Come on.
- It's still bloody. It's still...

01:21:13.527 --> 01:21:15.652
Are you okay?

01:21:17.387 --> 01:21:18.388
Good God!

01:21:18.488 --> 01:21:19.857
- Kiss me!
- You smell so terrible!

01:21:19.957 --> 01:21:22.592
So do you. Let's do this.

01:21:22.692 --> 01:21:24.327
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God...

01:21:24.427 --> 01:21:26.229
- Wait.
- What? No. What? Wait?

01:21:26.329 --> 01:21:28.332
<i>Hope you didn't have any plans
for Memorial Day.</i>

01:21:28.432 --> 01:21:32.036
<i>NASA has just announced
that an asteroid the size of Texas</i>

01:21:32.136 --> 01:21:35.973
<i>is on a direct path to Earth.
The end of the world is here again.</i>

01:21:36.173 --> 01:21:37.374
Shit!

01:21:37.474 --> 01:21:39.285
<i>On the bright side, till that happens,</i>

01:21:39.385 --> 01:21:41.704
<i>we got nothing but commercial-free
music lined up,</i>

01:21:41.804 --> 01:21:44.408
<i>and Justin Bieber
kicking it all off next!</i>

01:21:49.852 --> 01:21:52.280
Yes, I do. I'm doing it for you.

01:21:53.572 --> 01:21:57.460
Well, lucky enough for me, he's about
as good a shot as Helen Keller,

01:21:57.560 --> 01:22:00.763
her being blind and all. No.

01:22:01.363 --> 01:22:03.066
Her being a woman and all. I'm sorry.

01:22:03.166 --> 01:22:06.635
I started compiling zombie... Stop it!

01:22:06.735 --> 01:22:08.605
God!

01:22:08.805 --> 01:22:09.999
I'm so sorry.

01:22:10.974 --> 01:22:13.631
- So your parents found out...
- Yeah.

01:22:14.131 --> 01:22:16.273
So your pounts found...

01:22:18.114 --> 01:22:20.416
- Man...
- Hold on. Sorry! Emily was in.

01:22:20.516 --> 01:22:22.722
Emily, can you clear the shot?

01:22:22.822 --> 01:22:26.123
- My place is in the kitchen.
- We're more than helpy to happ out.

01:22:26.223 --> 01:22:29.973
Damn! Too good. Ready?

01:22:35.064 --> 01:22:37.601
- Why isn't the ice working?
- It's the left one.

01:22:37.701 --> 01:22:39.762
No, I did it.

01:22:42.505 --> 01:22:44.740
- And print it.
- Shit.

01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:48.027
You know, I was gonna throw this
little piece of shit away, but...

01:22:48.127 --> 01:22:50.600
Piece of shit away, but...

01:22:56.219 --> 01:22:58.154
Clever assholes.

01:22:59.455 --> 01:23:01.257
- Fuck! Jeez, guy.
- Cut!

01:23:01.557 --> 01:23:03.760
- Sheriff.
- Sheriff.

01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:05.696
Goddamn zombies on bicycles.

01:23:06.296 --> 01:23:08.055
And...

01:23:08.722 --> 01:23:09.916
Line.

01:23:10.116 --> 01:23:13.531
By the way, that was Hank's fault.
Do you guys live near an airstrip?

01:23:15.739 --> 01:23:19.354
Sorry. I wish we'd just cut
this crap off.

01:23:20.844 --> 01:23:22.545
Hold it up.

01:23:22.645 --> 01:23:26.098
You guys see that plane?
Could be a zombie plane attack!

01:23:26.198 --> 01:23:28.950
I just killed a zombie
that was about to...

01:23:29.050 --> 01:23:31.838
I just killed a zombie
that was about to bout your...

01:23:32.488 --> 01:23:34.728
Sucks for your girlfriend.

01:23:37.427 --> 01:23:40.697
We're losing our humanity here!

01:23:40.797 --> 01:23:43.365
Let's take a pa... I got you, dog.

01:23:43.465 --> 01:23:48.531
Let's take a page from Romeo's...
Let's take a page...

01:23:52.308 --> 01:23:55.796
Be quiet now. Be quiet.
They probably s-smell your stew,

01:23:55.896 --> 01:23:58.481
and it's giving them
the munchies or something.

01:23:58.581 --> 01:24:00.611
- Sorry.
- Let's take that again. That's okay.

01:24:06.623 --> 01:24:08.328
Okay.

01:24:20.503 --> 01:24:24.357
- I cleaned up a mess once.
- I'll make a mess on your face.

01:24:24.457 --> 01:24:27.893
- She'll clean it up.
- Very handy that way.

01:24:28.143 --> 01:24:31.214
Sounds like we should have went
to the airport instead of this farm.

01:24:31.314 --> 01:24:33.122
That is a...

01:24:33.222 --> 01:24:35.046
They got flights going out all the time.
