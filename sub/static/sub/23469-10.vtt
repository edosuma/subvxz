Previously on "Another Period"...

00:02.569 --> 00:04.304
- Are you a bitch?
- What?

00:04.338 --> 00:05.806
Tell these men this used to be
an illegal gambling den.

00:05.839 --> 00:08.108
We're gonna take ya far away.

00:08.141 --> 00:10.644
Well, I thought we were
moving product here, Blanche,

00:10.677 --> 00:13.146
starting a drug ring, which
would spread to other asylums,

00:13.180 --> 00:14.515
and from there trickle
down to the nation's

00:14.548 --> 00:16.049
- poorest neighborhoods.
- You get caught in here,

00:16.082 --> 00:17.718
you get dragged back
to the treatment room,

00:17.751 --> 00:20.053
and you wind up like that.

00:20.087 --> 00:22.656
My Prince Charming left a clue.

00:22.689 --> 00:24.424
Come back, mystery lady!

00:24.458 --> 00:26.360
Maybe you can write him
a really smart letter for me.

00:26.393 --> 00:28.428
Of course I will help you
write that letter.

00:28.462 --> 00:30.430
Write back saying that I want to meet

00:30.464 --> 00:32.098
Wednesday at sunset.

00:32.131 --> 00:33.767
This is my house now.

00:33.800 --> 00:36.503
You live here no more.

00:36.537 --> 00:39.239
- I've always loved you.
- I don't need you, Peepers.

00:53.487 --> 00:55.822
Can't you see I'm in the middle
of my afternoon stare?

00:55.856 --> 00:58.225
I'm very sorry, Madam. It's just...

01:01.295 --> 01:03.530
He just let himself in,
and I couldn't stop him.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.632
Dodo...

01:05.666 --> 01:08.802
I've come home to die.

01:08.836 --> 01:10.838
You're dying? Of what?

01:10.871 --> 01:13.740
Well... ... I have acquired

01:13.774 --> 01:16.877
an immune deficiency sickness.

01:16.910 --> 01:20.314
Dodo, I have nowhere else to go.

01:20.347 --> 01:22.683
Please let me die in my home.

01:22.716 --> 01:26.620
Fine, but it's my house now.

01:26.653 --> 01:31.091
And try not to die right there.
I just had the carpets cleaned.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.728
Ring twice if you're about to die.

01:34.761 --> 01:37.264
I'll fire up the incinerators.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.729
You know, Blanche, I've been
thinking about you a lot.

02:08.762 --> 02:10.229
I think I finally figured out

02:10.264 --> 02:11.865
why you were just giving the pills away.

02:11.899 --> 02:13.800
I'm trying to help people.

02:13.834 --> 02:16.203
Learned a lot on the inside.

02:16.236 --> 02:18.572
I've learned that euchre
is boring.

02:18.605 --> 02:20.741
I've learned that vaginas come
in a shockingly wide range

02:20.774 --> 02:23.610
of depths and dimensions.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.646
And I've learned that you, Mama Blanche,

02:25.679 --> 02:28.415
have a taste for power.

02:28.448 --> 02:30.284
What are you trying to say?

02:30.317 --> 02:32.419
We can make some real money, Blanche.

02:32.452 --> 02:34.955
We just need to get this stuff
out of the asylum.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.257
The world is our vagina, Blanche.

02:37.291 --> 02:39.960
Let's stuff it full of drugs!

02:39.993 --> 02:42.329
There's a hole
at the bottom of the gate,

02:42.362 --> 02:43.697
where inmates' husbands
put their manhood

02:43.730 --> 02:44.932
for conjugal visits.

02:44.965 --> 02:46.500
We could get the drugs out there.

02:46.533 --> 02:48.368
- And then you'll pass it off?
- Oh, I would,

02:48.402 --> 02:50.470
but years of stirring thick stews

02:50.504 --> 02:52.406
and carrying large cauldrons
of your family's waste

02:52.439 --> 02:53.974
has given me monstrously large forearms.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.909
They are grotesque.

02:55.943 --> 02:57.444
We need someone with smaller arms,

02:57.477 --> 02:59.479
a woman we can trust,

02:59.513 --> 03:01.682
a woman who hasn't worked
a day in her life.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.652
I've never carried anything.

03:07.421 --> 03:09.623

Oh, "bent over the well."

03:22.903 --> 03:25.672
Oh!

03:29.376 --> 03:31.011
So now that you are no longer in charge

03:31.044 --> 03:33.280
of Bellacourt,
I am no longer your employee.

03:33.313 --> 03:35.682
In light of this, I feel
it is my duty to tell you,

03:35.716 --> 03:38.018
I hope you are really dying.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.387
That seems unnecessarily cruel.

03:40.420 --> 03:42.356
What I mean is I hope this...

03:42.389 --> 03:45.492
this... this illness
is not meant to deceive

03:45.526 --> 03:47.628
the great Dodo Bellacourt.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.696
Oh, is that what you call her now?

03:49.730 --> 03:52.966
The great Dodo Bellacourt? Of course.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.702
She was born a meager
old money millionaire,

03:55.736 --> 03:59.306
but lifted herself up by her
velvet napping slipper straps

03:59.339 --> 04:01.508
to become an old money
multi-millionaire.

04:01.542 --> 04:03.544
She is a champion of the Tableau Vivant,

04:03.577 --> 04:07.548
an elephant collector,
and a charcuterie connoisseur.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.750
She's a fan of ham, huh?

04:09.783 --> 04:10.984
Indeed.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.886
I didn't know that.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.789
Actually, I don't know
much about Dodo at all.

04:15.822 --> 04:18.591
I wish I did,

04:18.625 --> 04:22.896
especially... ... before
I die of this terminal illness.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.035
What would you like to know?
I can talk about her for hours.

04:28.068 --> 04:31.438
Her name, Dodo, what's that stand for?

04:31.471 --> 04:32.472
You were married to her for 40 years

04:32.506 --> 04:34.575
and you do not know
what her name stands for?

04:34.608 --> 04:36.944
Is it Do-do-do-do-do-do-do?

04:36.977 --> 04:41.415
It is Dorothea Millicent
Quvenzhane Charles.

04:41.448 --> 04:44.017
The quirky moniker Dodo

04:44.051 --> 04:46.453
just captures her whimsical personality.

04:46.486 --> 04:49.556
- Where is she from?
- Some say heaven,

04:49.590 --> 04:52.459
others Rhode Island,

04:52.492 --> 04:54.461
but it is not her name
or where she's from

04:54.494 --> 04:56.096
that impresses me most.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.866
It is her six unique scowls,

04:58.899 --> 05:01.435
one for when her turtle soup is cold,

05:01.468 --> 05:04.605
one for when she hears
the laughter of children,

05:04.638 --> 05:08.475
one for when the sun is out,
one for a federal holiday,

05:08.509 --> 05:12.746
one for foreigners, and a special scowl

05:12.779 --> 05:15.716
for when a servant speaks
directly to her, like so.

05:17.117 --> 05:19.586
How do you know so much about her?

05:19.620 --> 05:22.923
I have served Lady Dodo
faithfully for many years,

05:22.956 --> 05:25.359
and once we made love on a boat,

05:25.392 --> 05:27.094
and once she sucked my
on a stagecoach.

05:30.764 --> 05:34.134
Ha! Oh, Peepers, I've never
heard you make a joke.

05:34.168 --> 05:36.436
Very funny.

05:36.470 --> 05:39.139
But if you ever say
anything like that again,

05:39.173 --> 05:41.441
I'll cut your throat.

05:41.475 --> 05:43.477
I understand and accept
your mixed message, sir.

I cannot wait to see the look
on Beatrice's vacuous face

05:50.751 --> 05:52.886
when she realizes that the man
who was supposed to help her

05:52.920 --> 05:56.123
get over Frederick is Frederick!

05:59.593 --> 06:00.761
Beatrice.

06:00.794 --> 06:01.762
Frederick?

06:01.795 --> 06:04.131
Fre... Be...

06:04.164 --> 06:05.699
- Hello.
- What are you doing here?

06:05.732 --> 06:07.968
Did you follow me? I was here first.

06:08.001 --> 06:10.003
Frederick, stop stalking me.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.138
This is where I'm meeting my beloved.

06:11.171 --> 06:12.739
I am not stalking you.

06:12.773 --> 06:14.541
This is where I'm supposed to
meet my beloved as well.

06:14.575 --> 06:15.909
Frederick, you have to go now.

06:15.943 --> 06:17.644
I can't let my beloved
see me here with you.

06:17.678 --> 06:18.846
I am not going anywhere.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.080
I made an appointment
to meet my beloved,

06:20.113 --> 06:21.715
and I want to be prompt.

06:21.748 --> 06:23.917
Fine. We will wait for
our beloveds together.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.919
Fine.

06:28.789 --> 06:31.191
Wait a second. Beatrice...

06:33.193 --> 06:36.730
Has it ever occurred to you
that your beloved

06:36.763 --> 06:37.965
and my beloved...

06:39.733 --> 06:41.468
Could show up at the exact same time

06:41.502 --> 06:42.970
and it would be so awkward? No.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.171
- Beloved!
- Beloved, I'm here!

06:44.204 --> 06:45.839
- Beloved!
- Beloved, come quick!

06:45.873 --> 06:47.941
Beloved!

07:08.787 --> 07:10.061
Uh, Dodo......

07:10.206 --> 07:12.742
how about those children of ours?

07:12.820 --> 07:14.722
Lillian is a ward of the state;

07:14.756 --> 07:17.158
Beatrice became addicted
to an X-ray machine;

07:17.191 --> 07:19.761
and Frederick
is a national embarrassment.

07:19.794 --> 07:22.997
Well, at least Hortense is dead.

07:23.031 --> 07:26.267
No, she's alive and well, sadly.

07:26.300 --> 07:29.170
- More meringue, Madam?
- No, they're too moist.

07:29.203 --> 07:31.539
They're practically pornographic.

07:33.608 --> 07:36.210
I know that scowl.

07:36.244 --> 07:39.013
That's the one you do when a
servant speaks to you directly.

07:40.682 --> 07:43.785
I didn't know
you noticed such things.

07:43.818 --> 07:45.820
I also know your name

07:45.853 --> 07:49.891
is Dorothea Millicent
Quvenzhane Charles.

07:51.392 --> 07:53.161
That is my name.

07:55.797 --> 07:58.700
Commodore, you're going to
dribble on the wainscoting.

07:58.733 --> 08:02.870
You might as well join me
here at the table.

08:15.049 --> 08:16.851
So, Dodo...

08:19.921 --> 08:22.957
How are you?

08:22.990 --> 08:24.859
Me?

08:24.892 --> 08:28.029
Well...

08:28.062 --> 08:31.699
I... I don't think you've ever
asked me that before.

08:31.733 --> 08:33.301
Well...

08:33.333 --> 08:35.169
it never seemed the right time.

08:35.203 --> 08:39.140
Oh, I'm fine, actually.

08:39.173 --> 08:41.909
I wish I could get closer,

08:41.943 --> 08:44.078
but I'm afraid I'm contagious,

08:44.111 --> 08:45.313
being so sick and all.

09:00.995 --> 09:03.431
Oh, I thought running a drug
ring from an insane asylum

09:03.464 --> 09:05.433
would be glamorous.

09:05.466 --> 09:06.601
Okay, whoever's on the other side,

09:06.634 --> 09:09.370
you better not put anything
besides money in my hand.

09:09.404 --> 09:11.005
- Got her!
- Ah! Let go.

09:11.039 --> 09:12.774
Help!

09:12.807 --> 09:14.375
Ow. Help!

09:17.145 --> 09:20.114
You can't do this! Help!

09:20.148 --> 09:22.383
I'm a rich person!

09:22.417 --> 09:24.852
Do you have any idea who I am?

09:24.886 --> 09:28.923
I'm Lillian Bellacourt.

09:32.260 --> 09:36.064
Ah, Peepers,
just the man I wanted to see.

09:36.097 --> 09:37.331
Dying seems to agree with you, sir.

09:37.365 --> 09:39.167
I've rarely seen you look more vital.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.935
I'm on death's door.

09:40.968 --> 09:42.270
What is it you want?

09:42.303 --> 09:43.304
Do you wish to pilfer more of my notions

09:43.337 --> 09:44.772
to ingratiate yourself to Dodo?

09:44.806 --> 09:46.207
Why, yes, in fact.

09:46.240 --> 09:49.010
What do you think of
this gift I got her?

09:49.043 --> 09:50.945
It's a bag of snakes.

09:52.213 --> 09:53.414
Most men would've chosen flowers.

09:53.448 --> 09:55.283
Flowers die in a day.

09:55.316 --> 09:58.353
Snakes live for 30 years!

09:58.386 --> 10:01.789
Peepers, you seem to know
what I should say to Dodo.

10:01.823 --> 10:03.091
I have an idea.

10:03.124 --> 10:04.726
Does it involve drowning those snakes?

10:04.759 --> 10:07.929
No! I want to do that thing

10:07.962 --> 10:11.332
from that play Dodo made me see
in the late '90s,

10:11.366 --> 10:14.202
Chryanost da Balzniak.

10:14.235 --> 10:17.271
- Cyrano de Bergerac, sir.
- Yes, let's do that,

10:17.305 --> 10:20.108
but less boring,
and not with rhyming couplets.

10:20.141 --> 10:22.510
Nobody talks like that.

10:22.543 --> 10:25.346
She is the sun on a cold winter's day,

10:25.380 --> 10:28.149
providing no warmth,
but lighting the way.

10:28.182 --> 10:31.753
Whoo! Oh, what is that?

10:31.786 --> 10:34.956
No one talks like that,
unless they're a poet

10:34.989 --> 10:36.958
who's never ever had sex.

10:39.060 --> 10:42.130
He used my words
to get in Dodo's good graces.

10:42.163 --> 10:45.366
Now I will use them
to let her see his two faces.

10:51.005 --> 10:53.241
I'm free!

10:53.274 --> 10:55.410
And all I had to do was sell
out Lillian to the orderlies.

10:55.443 --> 10:58.079
Poor thing's memory was erased.

11:00.014 --> 11:02.316
Nobody with Mama Blanche.

11:10.058 --> 11:12.260
How long have we been waiting here?

11:12.293 --> 11:15.396
- 12 days.
- 12 days?

11:15.430 --> 11:17.198
Or an hour. I don't know.

11:17.231 --> 11:18.366
If one of us would go inside

11:18.399 --> 11:20.001
and have a servant read a clock to us,

11:20.034 --> 11:21.903
- then we would know for sure.
- I'm not going.

11:21.936 --> 11:23.871
Well, either way,
it's starting to look like

11:23.905 --> 11:25.973
- we've been jilted.
- I know.

11:26.007 --> 11:27.942
I was so looking forward
to kissing my beloved

11:27.975 --> 11:30.211
and making you watch.

11:30.244 --> 11:32.880
Frederick, I feel...

11:32.914 --> 11:34.549
what's that thing
where your face goes like this?

11:34.582 --> 11:36.317
I have that too!

11:39.487 --> 11:41.255
- Frederick?
- Yes?

11:42.957 --> 11:44.525
Do you think that maybe...

11:47.929 --> 11:49.931
It would make us feel better
if we kissed each other?

11:49.964 --> 11:51.199
Maybe it will.

11:51.232 --> 11:52.934
It won't be like kissing our beloveds,

11:52.967 --> 11:55.937
but it will be like kissing somebody.

12:06.214 --> 12:08.616
Something about that kiss...

12:12.286 --> 12:14.255
Really reminded me
of my beloved.

12:14.288 --> 12:16.290
- Me too.
- Oh, Beatrice,

12:16.324 --> 12:19.027
will you ever forgive me
for sending you to a nunnery?

12:19.060 --> 12:21.462
- Oh, I forgot about that.
- Oh, well, that's good.

12:21.496 --> 12:23.431
- But now I remember.
- Damn it!

12:23.464 --> 12:25.466
But I forgive you, Frederick.

12:25.500 --> 12:26.968
- Oh.
- Accidents happen.

12:27.001 --> 12:29.003
Well, I should go.

12:29.037 --> 12:32.073
There's no use standing around here.

12:32.106 --> 12:33.274
Thank you for the feel-better kiss.

12:33.307 --> 12:34.409
You're welcome.

12:37.578 --> 12:40.882
Fre... Fre...

12:40.915 --> 12:42.216
- Did you call my name?
- No.

12:42.250 --> 12:44.285
Hm, all right.

12:44.318 --> 12:46.587
Hey...

12:48.690 --> 12:51.359
I used to have a ring just like that.

12:51.392 --> 12:53.895
Well, bye, Beatrice.

13:00.769 --> 13:03.172
I wonder whose ring this is.

13:03.894 --> 13:05.629
It's not even fun anymore. Frederick.

13:05.662 --> 13:07.531
It's Frederick!

13:07.564 --> 13:09.032
Frederick is your beloved!

13:09.066 --> 13:11.101
It's his name
on the ring!

13:11.134 --> 13:12.869
Frederick?

13:15.072 --> 13:16.974
We're very much alike.

13:19.209 --> 13:21.678
Who is this masked stranger?

13:21.712 --> 13:24.681
My Prince Charming left a clue.

13:24.715 --> 13:26.717
I met someone special at the ball.

13:26.750 --> 13:28.618
That's odd, because I met
a woman at the ball.

13:28.652 --> 13:31.088
And the only clue I have is this ring.

13:31.121 --> 13:32.255
He left it inside me.

13:32.289 --> 13:33.724
I used to have a ring just like that.

13:33.757 --> 13:35.025
Whose ring could this be?

13:35.058 --> 13:37.661
It's Frederick!

13:37.694 --> 13:39.196
Are you sure?

13:44.835 --> 13:46.236
It's not fun anymore.

13:46.269 --> 13:47.571
Frankly, I'm worried
my brother and sister

13:47.604 --> 13:49.740
have debilitating brain infections.

13:49.773 --> 13:52.242
Oh, I hope it's not catching.

13:52.275 --> 13:55.112
I really feel like
I've been coming into my own...

13:55.145 --> 13:56.580
lately.

13:57.814 --> 13:58.782
Well, I got sent to the treatment room,

13:58.815 --> 14:00.317
and it wasn't so bad.

14:00.350 --> 14:01.451
I mean, I don't remember who I am

14:01.485 --> 14:04.955
or why every time I cough
a pill pops out of my pussy,

14:04.988 --> 14:07.257
but I'm going home!

14:07.291 --> 14:09.593
Wherever that is.

14:14.164 --> 14:16.066
Ah, there you are.

14:16.099 --> 14:17.567
Are you sure you're cured?

14:17.601 --> 14:19.836
I thought you might be a lifer in there.

14:19.870 --> 14:22.773
Where am I? Who are you?

14:22.806 --> 14:24.241
I came all the way out here

14:24.274 --> 14:25.609
to do a patient transport.

14:25.642 --> 14:26.710
The least you could be is polite.

14:26.743 --> 14:29.046
Do you know how drunk I'd be
if it weren't for this?

14:29.079 --> 14:31.181
It's 10:00 a.m.
I'd be blinkered to my gilders.

14:31.214 --> 14:32.683
Now let's get you to the paddy wagon.

14:32.716 --> 14:34.851
Wait, your accent,

14:34.885 --> 14:37.788
it's making me feel
as though I should mistreat you,

14:37.821 --> 14:39.289
but I have to tell you, sir,

14:39.323 --> 14:41.191
I haven't the foggiest idea who you are.

14:41.224 --> 14:42.893
Why, I'm Officer O'Kelly.

14:42.926 --> 14:45.329
I'm the one that took you here.
Don't you remember?

14:45.362 --> 14:48.799
That's just the thing.
I don't remember anything.

14:48.832 --> 14:51.735
- I don't remember who I am.
- So let me get this straight.

14:51.768 --> 14:53.170
You don't remember who you are,

14:53.203 --> 14:54.738
and you don't remember where you are.

14:56.707 --> 15:00.110
All right then, well, we should
get you home, shouldn't we?

15:00.143 --> 15:02.112
- Home...
- Come with me, dear.

Two, three, four.

15:40.450 --> 15:43.353
- I've been a fool for too long.
- I've been a fool for too long!

15:43.387 --> 15:45.789
I've loved you
since the moment I met you.

15:45.822 --> 15:49.059
I've loved you
since the moment I met you.

15:49.092 --> 15:50.861
And now I want to tell you...

15:50.894 --> 15:53.697
Now I want to tell you...

15:53.730 --> 15:55.866
I'm not actually sick. I was lying.

15:55.899 --> 15:58.669
I'm not actually sick. I was lying.

16:06.810 --> 16:09.413
I am lying.

16:09.446 --> 16:11.214
Truth be told,

16:11.248 --> 16:15.018
I thought I could trick you
into marrying me again.

16:15.052 --> 16:16.153
I'm sorry.

16:18.088 --> 16:20.857
I really had fun getting to know you.

16:22.960 --> 16:24.995
Good bye, Dodo.

16:27.030 --> 16:28.699
Good bye, Commodore.

16:30.467 --> 16:33.470
- Commodore...
- Yes?

16:33.503 --> 16:36.039
That's the first time
in our entire marriage

16:36.073 --> 16:38.875
you've told me the truth.

16:38.909 --> 16:41.478
Oh, uh, I also brought you snakes!

16:41.511 --> 16:43.914
S...

16:43.947 --> 16:47.050
What a charming and long-lasting gift.

16:47.084 --> 16:48.285
What?

16:48.318 --> 16:50.721
- Commodore...
- Yes?

16:50.754 --> 16:52.389
Come upstairs.

16:52.422 --> 16:54.758
I'll be right there, darling!

17:01.164 --> 17:03.300
Oh, Dodo...

17:03.333 --> 17:05.502
where does one even begin?

17:07.838 --> 17:11.375
I love the way you despise your children

17:11.407 --> 17:14.243
and the bulging vein in your forehead

17:14.277 --> 17:16.880
when you berate the servants.

17:16.913 --> 17:20.483
I love your long, depleted bosoms.

17:20.517 --> 17:24.021
But most of all, Dodo...

17:24.054 --> 17:26.757
I love you

17:26.790 --> 17:29.259
and all the many women that you are.

17:31.395 --> 17:34.431
Well, I suppose you're with

17:34.464 --> 17:37.834
the man you were always
meant to be with.

17:37.868 --> 17:41.438
Perhaps now, he can appreciate you.

17:44.408 --> 17:47.411
Oh, Commie!

17:47.444 --> 17:50.314
Oh! Oh.

17:51.968 --> 17:53.236
Okay...

17:53.243 --> 17:55.903
Here's your kitchen, where you cook me

17:55.986 --> 17:58.856
three squares a day, of course, usually.

17:58.880 --> 18:02.317
And this is the other room. Two total.

18:02.350 --> 18:05.487
Just enough for our tiny
little family, isn't it?

18:05.520 --> 18:07.322
I live here?

18:07.355 --> 18:09.591
Oh, well, you don't just live here.

18:09.624 --> 18:12.360
This is where we eat,
and this is where we pray.

18:12.394 --> 18:13.828
And, of course...

18:15.263 --> 18:17.198
We make love here.

18:17.232 --> 18:18.566
I make love to you?

18:18.600 --> 18:20.302
Why would I do that?

18:20.335 --> 18:22.337
Your face is physically ugly,

18:22.370 --> 18:23.838
and you smell of steamed cabbage.

18:23.872 --> 18:25.173
It's boiled cabbage, dear,

18:25.206 --> 18:27.008
and you make love to me
with no protection,

18:27.042 --> 18:28.877
because you're my wife.

18:28.910 --> 18:30.979
I'm your wife?

19:12.954 --> 19:14.422
Your name's Kerrtrussel?

19:14.456 --> 19:16.591
- Ay.
- What's my name?

19:16.625 --> 19:17.993
Oh, your name...

19:19.928 --> 19:23.665
Be Garbage... Ella. Garbagella.

19:23.698 --> 19:26.301
Like Cinderella,
but with more coffee grinds.

19:26.334 --> 19:27.902
My name is Garbagella?

19:27.936 --> 19:30.405
- Ain't it though?
- Hold on...

19:30.438 --> 19:32.907
if you're my husband, where's my ring?

19:32.941 --> 19:34.976
Uh, you hate jewelry.

19:35.010 --> 19:36.311
You never liked it.

19:36.344 --> 19:38.613
But you love oral sex.

19:38.647 --> 19:40.181
That's your big thing you love.

19:40.215 --> 19:43.184
You hate jewelry all day,
but you love a good gaggin'.

19:43.218 --> 19:45.153
Oh, sorry!

19:45.186 --> 19:46.955
Come. Sit next to me

19:46.988 --> 19:50.325
on the green couch you love so much.

19:54.629 --> 19:58.066
- Kerrtrussel...
- Hi, darling.

19:58.099 --> 20:01.469
Why do we live here? It's so terrible.

20:01.503 --> 20:06.074
Ay, it's not ideal,
but it needs a woman's touch.

20:06.107 --> 20:09.277
That's right.
A woman's nice, soft touch.

20:09.311 --> 20:13.114
Now take this, and make
everything spit-shined

20:13.148 --> 20:14.482
to your liking.

20:14.516 --> 20:17.352
Oh, no. Am I a servant?

20:17.385 --> 20:20.255
No, no, you're not a servant.
You're a wife.

20:20.288 --> 20:22.190
The job description is roughly the same,

20:22.223 --> 20:24.426
but you'll figure it out.

20:41.543 --> 20:43.244
Hell's bells.

20:43.278 --> 20:45.547
Dodo!

20:45.580 --> 20:47.515
Oh, Peepers.

Stare into space.

21:04.728 --> 21:07.431
That's what you do best.
Just stare into space.

21:07.464 --> 21:09.466
And cry.

21:09.500 --> 21:12.136
- Whatever you say.
