00:00.042 --> 00:01.992
Previously on "Once Upon a Time"...

00:02.017 --> 00:03.854
I did some digging today.

00:03.879 --> 00:06.475
What makes you think I'd
be interested in some thing

00:06.500 --> 00:07.318
that you dug up?

00:07.343 --> 00:09.066
Because I didn't dig up some thing.

00:09.092 --> 00:11.326
- I dug up someone.
- Anastasia?

00:11.428 --> 00:12.693
I don't understand She's...

00:12.796 --> 00:14.029
Perfectly preserved.

00:14.131 --> 00:17.332
I've been trying my whole
life to win your approval.

00:17.434 --> 00:21.036
But now I realize I'm
never going to get it

00:21.104 --> 00:22.103
because I'm not her.

00:22.205 --> 00:24.439
You're most certainly not.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073

00:55.205 --> 00:56.871
Why'd you stop, Rapunzel?

00:59.105 --> 01:01.317
Because I found our
family something to eat.

01:02.183 --> 01:03.747
I'm sorry the burden falls to you

01:03.772 --> 01:05.539
to look after us all.

01:05.641 --> 01:08.041
You're a brilliant tailor, Marcus.

01:08.110 --> 01:09.676
Once I mend you, you'll
stitch together the life

01:09.695 --> 01:12.463
we've always dreamed of... our family.

01:13.146 --> 01:16.639
Are you sure it's safe
to go in there, Mama?

01:16.769 --> 01:18.335
The lanterns will connect us.

01:18.437 --> 01:20.204
You'll see mine in there,

01:20.306 --> 01:22.406
and yours will guide
me back to you here.

01:23.576 --> 01:24.875
Remember...

01:24.977 --> 01:27.984
for my family, I'll always find a way.

01:58.498 --> 02:02.012
Who dares trespass in Gothel's garden?

02:03.737 --> 02:05.316
I'll apologize for taking some food,

02:05.418 --> 02:08.051
but I won't apologize for
trying to help my family.

02:08.154 --> 02:09.720
My husband is sick.

02:09.822 --> 02:11.486
My kids have gone two
days without a bite.

02:11.506 --> 02:15.241
Many people come here in an
attempt to steal my magic.

02:15.343 --> 02:17.110
And yet, here you are

02:17.212 --> 02:22.482
selflessly risking
my ire for radishes...

02:22.584 --> 02:24.517
It's rare to find a flower

02:24.619 --> 02:27.921
that can grow amongst
the weeds of human nature.

02:28.516 --> 02:30.824
I meant no disrespect.

02:30.926 --> 02:32.926
I can work as payment,
if that pleases you.

02:33.028 --> 02:35.461
If your family is your
be all and end all,

02:35.530 --> 02:38.131
what would you sacrifice
to give them a better life?

02:38.233 --> 02:39.966
I would do anything.

02:41.369 --> 02:44.404
Anything is something I can work with.

02:44.506 --> 02:45.738
We have a deal.

03:02.991 --> 03:04.057
Aah!

03:37.592 --> 03:39.826
There is no way out of this tower.

03:39.928 --> 03:41.594
I never agreed to this.

03:41.696 --> 03:43.897
Oh, but you did.

03:44.705 --> 03:46.833
You swore to pay any price

03:46.935 --> 03:49.162
for your family's happiness.

03:49.187 --> 03:50.722
And there's a distinct difference

03:50.747 --> 03:53.443
between theirs and yours.

03:53.468 --> 03:54.474
They'll come for me.

03:54.542 --> 03:56.765
But they'll never find you.

03:59.447 --> 04:03.983
Marcus! Help!

04:04.085 --> 04:06.786
Anastasia! Drizella!

04:06.888 --> 04:08.888
Help me!

04:19.166 --> 04:20.700
Hmm.

04:20.769 --> 04:23.970
Orange looks better on the
women on that Netflix show.

04:24.005 --> 04:27.907
My wardrobe has much in common
with you, as my daughter.

04:28.009 --> 04:29.575
In both cases,

04:29.644 --> 04:32.583
I'm stuck with what was thrust upon me.

04:34.015 --> 04:35.648
Why are you here, Ivy?

04:35.717 --> 04:37.750
No, you're right.

04:37.852 --> 04:39.559
That's enough small talk.

04:40.422 --> 04:42.622
You...

04:42.724 --> 04:45.491
have hidden something away from me.

04:45.593 --> 04:48.094
A family heirloom, if you will.

04:48.163 --> 04:49.963
You want Anastasia's body?

04:50.065 --> 04:52.332
Then I can do what you never could...

04:52.434 --> 04:54.600
Wake my sister up.

04:55.291 --> 04:58.171
No. You want the magic within her.

04:58.273 --> 04:59.372
And once you get it,

04:59.407 --> 05:02.208
we both know what you
plan to do with her.

05:04.813 --> 05:08.314
You know, I learned
negotiating from you.

05:09.437 --> 05:12.685
I have control of all
of your assets now.

05:12.721 --> 05:15.888
You have no money, no lawyer,

05:15.991 --> 05:18.257
no Chanel.

05:18.326 --> 05:20.226
Sharing Anastasia's whereabouts

05:20.261 --> 05:23.129
is the only way you can get out of here.

05:23.198 --> 05:26.399
I don't need you to get me out of here.

05:26.468 --> 05:28.368
Fine.

05:28.575 --> 05:30.336
I'll find her myself.

05:30.405 --> 05:31.504
I have Gothel helping me now.

05:31.573 --> 05:32.872
I bet you do.

05:32.941 --> 05:36.809
You always did gravitate toward
any mother figure you could.

05:36.878 --> 05:40.046
And you always gravitated to
the love of only one daughter.

05:40.148 --> 05:41.714
Aww.

05:41.816 --> 05:44.717
Did someone not get enough hugs?

05:49.557 --> 05:50.990
Have fun in prison.

05:54.062 --> 05:57.730
This isn't the first time
someone's tried to lock me up.

05:57.799 --> 06:00.733
Apparently, you've forgotten
the lesson they learned.

06:01.661 --> 06:04.370
When it comes to my family...

06:04.472 --> 06:06.906
I always find a way.

06:07.599 --> 06:10.120
Mom, I'm so happy to
be back here with you.

06:10.145 --> 06:12.045
Yeah, me too.

06:12.338 --> 06:13.813
Come on.

06:13.882 --> 06:15.515
Got to grab your backpack for school.

06:15.617 --> 06:18.217
And don't forget... you
got ballet after, okay?

06:18.319 --> 06:19.952
Actually, now that
I'm back here for good,

06:20.055 --> 06:21.888
I was wondering if we
could invite Henry over

06:21.923 --> 06:23.389
and share the good news with him.

06:25.126 --> 06:28.494
Let's just see how, um...
we can get through day one,

06:28.563 --> 06:30.163
and then we can talk
about it tomorrow, okay?

06:30.231 --> 06:31.264
Okay, Mom.

06:33.168 --> 06:35.535
Kid's not gonna give up on this, huh?

06:35.603 --> 06:37.804
She keeps trying to "Parent Trap" you.

06:37.906 --> 06:39.439
Real question is, when Lucy finally does

06:39.507 --> 06:41.841
trick you and Mr., uh... Mixtape

06:41.943 --> 06:44.477
into some romantic spot,

06:44.579 --> 06:46.479
will there actually
be any romance to play?

06:47.649 --> 06:50.016
I don't know what to do about Henry.

06:50.085 --> 06:53.419
I went to Roni's bar to see if
we can try to figure things out.

06:53.444 --> 06:55.918
I heard that he took off
with her to San Francisco.

06:55.943 --> 06:57.209
And what's he doing there?

06:57.234 --> 07:00.208
The bartender was very
vague about the details.

07:00.295 --> 07:02.361
He just said that Roni needed a ride.

07:02.464 --> 07:03.930
Ready to go.

07:03.998 --> 07:05.699
Uh, you want to walk me?

07:05.724 --> 07:07.200
I'd love to, Lucy.

07:10.738 --> 07:13.106
Time to take you back.

07:13.251 --> 07:14.784
Not exactly Tiffany,

07:14.809 --> 07:17.810
but they are bracelets all the same.

07:17.912 --> 07:20.946
I've missed our talks, Detective.

07:21.015 --> 07:23.315
Did you enjoy the one
with your daughter?

07:23.417 --> 07:26.418
To be honest, not since she was 4.

07:26.520 --> 07:28.621
I only agreed to meet
with her because I knew

07:28.689 --> 07:31.857
it would afford me the
chance to speak with you.

07:31.959 --> 07:34.026
Oh, well, I am flattered.

07:34.095 --> 07:38.030
But given your... current situation,

07:38.132 --> 07:39.765
you don't have very much to offer.

07:39.867 --> 07:41.700
How could I forget your skill set

07:41.769 --> 07:44.136
always comes with a price?

07:46.040 --> 07:47.973
What are you getting at?

07:48.042 --> 07:50.409
I need help getting to my daughter.

07:50.478 --> 07:52.211
The little brat was just here.

07:52.313 --> 07:53.879
Not Ivy.

07:54.279 --> 07:55.858
Anastasia.

07:59.220 --> 08:02.121
Nobody's here. We're all alone.

08:03.090 --> 08:04.490
Why pretend you're not concerned

08:04.592 --> 08:06.959
that Gothel is out of the tower?

08:07.061 --> 08:09.128
Now, you say that...

08:09.230 --> 08:12.865
like I should understand
what all your nonsense means.

08:14.059 --> 08:15.401
Well, why don't you let me know

08:15.503 --> 08:18.470
when I do start making sense?

08:18.572 --> 08:22.675
All the knickknacks
you've been collecting,

08:22.777 --> 08:25.744
that great love you're separated from,

08:25.846 --> 08:28.213
that dagger you can't
seem to get rid of.

08:30.451 --> 08:31.850
Stand up.

08:36.256 --> 08:40.525
How is the search for
The Guardian going?

08:41.916 --> 08:44.730
I have all the information
you've long sought.

08:44.832 --> 08:47.099
You help me today,

08:47.201 --> 08:49.068
and I'll gladly share it with you...

08:51.172 --> 08:53.238
Rumplestiltskin.

09:00.715 --> 09:01.847
I'd say...

09:05.586 --> 09:08.120
you've got yourself a deal...

09:08.222 --> 09:09.254
Rapunzel.

10:22.836 --> 10:24.839
Remember your family.

10:25.250 --> 10:27.717
Be brave.

10:33.132 --> 10:35.433
Lovely morning, Detective.

10:35.502 --> 10:37.668
How are you out of jail?

10:37.770 --> 10:39.770
In a word... determination.

10:39.839 --> 10:42.039
I didn't get to be who
I am sitting around,

10:42.141 --> 10:43.608
waiting for others to improve my odds.

10:43.710 --> 10:45.042
And I didn't ask for a TED Talk.

10:45.144 --> 10:48.546
I asked how you managed
to sidestep your charges.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.314
I'm afraid that honor goes to you.

10:51.684 --> 10:53.050
You failed to get a warrant.

10:53.119 --> 10:55.786
I had exigent circumstance.
There was immediate danger.

10:55.889 --> 10:57.421
Judge didn't see it that way.

10:57.908 --> 11:00.132
Don't you mean you
made certain he didn't?

11:00.793 --> 11:02.026
You dress it up any way you want.

11:02.051 --> 11:04.161
I know you're getting something
out of this arrangement.

11:04.230 --> 11:07.198
Come clean with it now, or
I'll go dig it up myself.

11:07.267 --> 11:08.499
I'd advise against that, Detective.

11:08.568 --> 11:12.169
Or has ignoring me not
done enough damage already?

11:21.981 --> 11:25.449
Congratulations. You're a free woman.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.184
Now, where's Anastasia?

11:27.287 --> 11:28.853
It does me no good to get to my daughter

11:28.922 --> 11:30.855
without the means to wake her.

11:30.957 --> 11:33.424
You and I have a few stops to make.

11:39.632 --> 11:41.999
Uh... Jacinda,

11:42.068 --> 11:43.668
there's a fugitive at the door for you.

11:43.736 --> 11:46.871
What I am is a free woman
in need of a manicure.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.439
New evidence is coming to light

11:48.508 --> 11:50.741
that will show just who
the villain is in all this.

11:50.766 --> 11:53.344
And, uh, the first thing you
do is come here about Lucy?

11:53.446 --> 11:56.480
Specifically about our
long-standing agreement.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.416
If you think that you
are getting Lucy back...

11:58.518 --> 12:01.252
I'm here to, quite
literally, do the opposite.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.421
I am removing all claims of custody

12:03.456 --> 12:05.356
and handing Lucy over to you.

12:07.126 --> 12:08.492
Wait. Where's the catch?

12:08.595 --> 12:11.295
There is none.

12:11.364 --> 12:15.366
I handed you that custody
paperwork years ago

12:15.435 --> 12:18.202
in the hopes that you would tear it up

12:18.304 --> 12:19.971
and throw it back at me.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.739
The fact that you signed Lucy over

12:21.841 --> 12:24.308
told me who you were as a person.

12:24.410 --> 12:25.543
It was a test?

12:25.645 --> 12:27.478
One you failed.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.281
And now one you've passed.

12:30.948 --> 12:32.327
You reached out to Nick

12:32.352 --> 12:35.586
and wisely used Lucy's
lawyer of a father

12:35.688 --> 12:37.254
to clear matters up.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.982
I, for one, am glad
he's back in your life.

12:40.537 --> 12:41.592
I would have him thoroughly vet this.

12:41.661 --> 12:43.527
I think he'll find
it's on the up and up.

12:43.596 --> 12:46.797
Forgive me, but, um, where
is all this coming from?

12:46.866 --> 12:49.166
Being locked away from the world

12:49.268 --> 12:51.135
affords one the
opportunity to think about

12:51.237 --> 12:54.038
what's most important, and...

12:54.107 --> 12:56.574
the answer I found...

12:56.676 --> 12:58.609
was Lucy's happiness.

13:00.046 --> 13:01.646
I'm having her things sent over here,

13:01.714 --> 13:04.515
but she's rather fond
of this little dolly.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.618
I don't know what to say.

13:07.643 --> 13:09.376
I do.

13:09.555 --> 13:12.123
Family is worth fighting for.

13:12.191 --> 13:15.192
I'm so very proud
that you never gave up.

13:29.208 --> 13:31.108
They're serving dessert in the parlor.

13:31.177 --> 13:32.877
We should go in.

13:32.902 --> 13:35.503
I can't give up on our mother, Drizella.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.649
One of these lanterns could
help guide her back to us.

13:38.718 --> 13:41.252
It's been six years, Anastasia.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.713
I know it's silly to believe, but...

13:45.391 --> 13:48.325
something feels different about tonight.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.127
My girls...

13:53.362 --> 13:55.096
Mother?

13:59.205 --> 14:01.572
You're so grown up

14:01.674 --> 14:04.308
I saw the lanterns,
and I knew it was you.

14:12.051 --> 14:13.317
Rapunzel?

14:17.957 --> 14:19.990
I thought you were dead.

14:21.900 --> 14:24.468
I searched for weeks.

14:24.630 --> 14:26.230
All I found was your tattered cloak.

14:26.299 --> 14:27.832
It was a trick.

14:27.900 --> 14:30.000
A witch promised me you'd all thrive,

14:30.069 --> 14:31.202
but my side of the bargain

14:31.304 --> 14:34.438
required me to be
locked away in a tower.

14:34.507 --> 14:38.075
But the love of my family
helped me survive all this time.

14:39.519 --> 14:42.820
I'm so happy I'm finally
back to share it with you.

14:45.284 --> 14:47.151
Who is that, Father?

14:47.253 --> 14:48.719
Go back inside, Ella.

14:51.791 --> 14:53.491
What does she mean, "Father"?

14:56.544 --> 14:58.511
She's my stepdaughter.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.002
I had no idea that...

15:05.071 --> 15:06.237
Marcus?

15:13.079 --> 15:15.513
This is my wife, Cecilia.

15:15.615 --> 15:18.849
Now... who might you be?

15:27.009 --> 15:28.653
Why is it you people work

15:28.678 --> 15:30.411
all your little lives in locked rooms

15:30.480 --> 15:33.914
only to re-create nature's greatness?

15:33.983 --> 15:35.483
It's air freshener.

15:38.120 --> 15:40.221
Your mother's entanglement
with Rumplestiltskin

15:40.289 --> 15:41.689
is going to prove meddlesome.

15:41.714 --> 15:44.549
She can team up with all
seven dwarves for all I care.

15:44.660 --> 15:48.629
If we follow her, she
will lead us to Anastasia.

15:48.698 --> 15:50.865
It's a mistake to underestimate her.

15:51.361 --> 15:53.834
Are you speaking from experience?

15:53.903 --> 15:57.271
Because in mine, she
always takes the wrong path.

16:01.127 --> 16:02.943
She made her choices,

16:03.045 --> 16:05.135
and now she'll have to deal with mine.

16:12.855 --> 16:14.488
Looks like the kettle's run dry.

16:14.513 --> 16:17.625
It's your company we came
for, not the tea, Mother.

16:17.727 --> 16:18.759
Right, Drizzy?

16:18.999 --> 16:21.762
Actually, I am thirsty.

16:24.867 --> 16:26.677
Daddy!

16:27.904 --> 16:28.936
Hi, sweeties.

16:29.005 --> 16:30.704
You ready to head back to the manor?

16:31.169 --> 16:34.108
I need to speak with your mother.

16:34.176 --> 16:35.910
I'm losing them, Marcus.

16:35.978 --> 16:38.445
That isn't true. The girls love you.

16:38.548 --> 16:41.215
Anastasia doesn't
stop talking about you.

16:41.284 --> 16:43.533
Drizella slips further away every day.

16:43.558 --> 16:44.919
You have to give it time.

16:45.021 --> 16:47.655
She was so young when you left.

16:49.292 --> 16:51.992
Here.

16:52.094 --> 16:53.294
I brought you something.

16:58.234 --> 16:59.967
That's my old cloak.

17:00.036 --> 17:01.535
I mended it.

17:05.241 --> 17:07.107
You kept it all these years?

17:19.356 --> 17:21.823
Rapunzel...

17:21.924 --> 17:24.223
had you not made that
deal that stormy night,

17:24.327 --> 17:28.395
I'd likely be dead and
our girls in the streets.

17:28.497 --> 17:31.599
Our family owes all
its happiness to you.

17:33.588 --> 17:35.421
Do you still love me?

17:39.809 --> 17:41.275
Of course I do.

17:42.422 --> 17:45.074
And our girls mean everything to me.

17:47.917 --> 17:49.717
But so does Ella.

17:49.819 --> 17:51.552
And Cecilia.

17:55.091 --> 17:56.123
I have to go.

18:06.469 --> 18:10.004
You're too strong for tears.

18:12.222 --> 18:13.539
If you're here to put
me back in your tower...

18:13.564 --> 18:14.539
I'm not.

18:15.613 --> 18:19.346
In fact, I admire your
resourcefulness in escaping.

18:19.415 --> 18:21.715
I was surprised to find
my family like this.

18:21.817 --> 18:23.117
The deal was honored.

18:23.219 --> 18:25.586
They sleep every night
in their cozy manor.

18:26.774 --> 18:27.855
And yet I, myself,

18:27.923 --> 18:29.490
may as well still be
locked in your tower.

18:29.558 --> 18:31.759
That was the deal.

18:34.797 --> 18:37.531
You knew that I would escape
eventually, didn't you?

18:37.600 --> 18:38.699
I had hopes.

18:38.801 --> 18:39.767
Why?

18:39.835 --> 18:42.036
You proved pure enough
to sacrifice yourself

18:42.138 --> 18:44.104
for your family's happiness.

18:44.206 --> 18:45.639
And now I'm curious to see

18:45.741 --> 18:48.609
if you'll sacrifice
someone else's for yours.

18:57.353 --> 19:00.220
Just a little something
I unearthed in Wonderland.

19:00.289 --> 19:03.657
Squeeze it into Cecilia's
drink when she least expects it.

19:05.494 --> 19:10.030
You can make her go away.
You can have your family back.

19:14.300 --> 19:16.770
Cecilia's an innocent in
this. I won't hurt her.

19:16.872 --> 19:18.405
I'm not that person.

19:18.474 --> 19:20.307
If you're truly who you
believe yourself to be,

19:20.409 --> 19:21.608
then perhaps, over time,

19:21.677 --> 19:24.211
your path will bend towards happiness.

19:24.313 --> 19:26.280
If not...

19:26.348 --> 19:28.649
there's always my way.

19:40.863 --> 19:42.062
Well?

19:42.164 --> 19:43.931
The paperwork's legit.

19:45.601 --> 19:48.235
For real? Lucy's mine?

19:48.337 --> 19:50.370
Lucy's yours. Belfrey conceded.

19:50.473 --> 19:52.439
- Don't mess with me.
- It's true.

19:52.541 --> 19:54.174
It's finally over.

19:55.234 --> 19:56.744
I-I wasn't...

19:56.853 --> 19:58.869
I wasn't sure that it was the...
The right thing to call you,

19:58.894 --> 20:01.744
but I'm so glad I... so glad I did.

20:01.769 --> 20:03.884
Well, that smile is
worth any work on my part.

20:03.953 --> 20:06.487
I owe you my future life.

20:06.589 --> 20:08.369
Lucy... Lucy and me both!

20:08.416 --> 20:09.882
Oh, my God!

20:19.628 --> 20:21.294
Whoa.

20:21.396 --> 20:22.862
No, I, uh...

20:22.964 --> 20:24.197
- I don't want to do this.
- Oh.

20:24.265 --> 20:26.733
I'm sorry. I must... must
have, uh, misread the signs.

20:26.835 --> 20:28.735
No, no.

20:28.837 --> 20:31.571
I mean, yes.

20:31.640 --> 20:33.206
B-But I-it's not about you.

20:33.308 --> 20:38.511
I am... I'm so grateful that
you're back in our lives.

20:38.927 --> 20:41.481
And I want you to have
a relationship with Lucy.

20:42.872 --> 20:44.829
Me too.

22:23.551 --> 22:26.219
What are you doing, Weaver?

22:35.646 --> 22:37.713
"Rollin' Bayou." Look at that.

22:37.782 --> 22:41.016
The little lady's, uh, prettied
up since her impound days.

22:41.085 --> 22:43.919
Yep, she's nearly
ready for the big ball.

22:43.988 --> 22:45.954
So, did you just come
here to compliment my work?

22:46.023 --> 22:46.989
Not just.

22:47.057 --> 22:48.924
Uh, I have to follow
up on the Cluck's fire.

22:48.993 --> 22:50.125
That's weird.

22:50.194 --> 22:52.161
Detective Weaver
followed up the other day.

22:52.229 --> 22:53.862
We're working different shifts.

22:53.931 --> 22:55.264
I don't want to bother
him on his day off.

22:55.332 --> 22:57.699
Maybe you can just fill
me in on what you told him.

22:57.768 --> 22:58.834
He told me about the alley door

22:58.903 --> 23:00.702
that was jimmied with a knife.

23:01.108 --> 23:01.981
I don't know.

23:02.006 --> 23:03.539
He said they found it in a Dumpster.

23:03.607 --> 23:05.441
He asked me if I recognized it.

23:05.543 --> 23:06.742
Did you?

23:06.811 --> 23:09.845
No. Believe me, I would
remember a knife like that.

23:09.947 --> 23:10.913
Can you describe it?

23:10.981 --> 23:13.682
Actually, I'll do you one better.

23:13.751 --> 23:15.717
If I'm gonna be honest,
it didn't exactly feel

23:15.786 --> 23:18.821
like the ideal item
to jimmy a door with.

23:18.988 --> 23:21.290
It was more like a...

23:21.392 --> 23:23.368
something out of a Tim Burton movie.

23:24.562 --> 23:26.929
Detective Weaver practically
shoved it into my hands.

23:26.997 --> 23:29.431
He kept asking if I felt anything.

23:29.500 --> 23:31.200
What's this all about, anyway?

23:31.302 --> 23:33.168
I don't know.

23:33.270 --> 23:35.504
But I'm gonna find out.

23:57.194 --> 23:58.894
You know we're being followed,

23:58.996 --> 24:01.096
been with us since the police station.

24:01.198 --> 24:03.599
I'm aware. I'm not concerned.

24:03.701 --> 24:05.434
There's a plan for those two.

24:12.510 --> 24:14.510
I was rather expecting a body.

24:14.612 --> 24:15.777
Hmm.

24:15.846 --> 24:18.780
Glad I can still get one
over on Rumplestiltskin.

24:28.259 --> 24:30.058
You're planning a trip?

24:30.160 --> 24:31.527
No.

24:31.595 --> 24:33.962
Inside here is all I
need to awaken Anastasia.

24:34.031 --> 24:35.597
You seem to be jumping
through a lot of hoops

24:35.699 --> 24:37.966
to reunite with one daughter

24:38.035 --> 24:41.054
when the other waits just outside.

24:44.108 --> 24:45.741
I had a son...

24:45.766 --> 24:49.945
who thought as little
of me as Ivy does of you.

24:50.014 --> 24:52.881
But I never stopped trying
to make things right with him.

24:52.950 --> 24:55.050
Good for you.

24:55.119 --> 24:57.185
My son...

24:57.288 --> 24:58.587
Bae...

24:59.169 --> 25:00.789
meant the world to me.

25:00.858 --> 25:02.791
And I lost him.

25:03.861 --> 25:06.662
Don't compare your grief to mine.

25:06.730 --> 25:08.916
You have no idea what I've been through.

25:11.354 --> 25:14.703
Oh, but you see, Rapunzel... I do.

25:15.705 --> 25:18.774
And I know what it's
like to seek reunion.

25:20.110 --> 25:22.110
There are costs involved.

25:22.390 --> 25:24.446
And wouldn't you have paid them?

25:24.548 --> 25:26.582
I did.

25:26.792 --> 25:28.625
And then some.

25:30.354 --> 25:33.255
Well, then, you know I can't stop.

25:33.505 --> 25:36.406
Not now that I finally have a way.

25:37.528 --> 25:38.794
If you have what you need,

25:38.862 --> 25:41.530
where's the information you
promised me on The Guardian?

25:41.599 --> 25:45.100
Oh, you'll get it...
once Anastasia's awake.

25:45.169 --> 25:48.937
And for the record, that girl out there

25:49.006 --> 25:52.074
hasn't been my daughter
for a very long time.

25:52.176 --> 25:55.177
_

26:06.857 --> 26:09.224
You are amazing.

26:09.293 --> 26:11.660
You make the best lavender
lemonade north of the bayou.

26:11.762 --> 26:13.495
Marcus mentioned they
were your favorite.

26:13.597 --> 26:16.064
Well, as nice as they are,

26:16.166 --> 26:17.799
why are you working today?

26:18.092 --> 26:19.735
It's your daughter's birthday.

26:19.837 --> 26:22.337
You should be celebrating.

26:22.679 --> 26:24.012
Excuse me.

26:28.512 --> 26:31.046
She's trying, you know.

26:31.148 --> 26:32.080
I do.

26:34.284 --> 26:36.051
You see how well the girls get along?

26:36.153 --> 26:38.253
Maybe us parents should
take a cue from them.

26:38.519 --> 26:40.022
Marcus, she's looking after my two.

26:40.090 --> 26:41.289
I'm not looking after hers.

26:41.358 --> 26:42.824
I know you see it that way.

26:42.849 --> 26:44.029
I'm alone here.

26:44.054 --> 26:45.460
You're really not.

26:45.529 --> 26:46.962
Our girls need you.

26:48.499 --> 26:51.900
I gave Drizella a gift.
She didn't even smile.

26:52.002 --> 26:53.201
Ohh!

26:54.672 --> 26:58.808
It's amazing, Mother!
Thank you! Thank you!

27:50.367 --> 27:52.494
Well, well, well.

27:52.836 --> 27:54.463
You certainly took your time.

27:54.488 --> 27:56.388
Where's Victoria?

27:56.533 --> 27:59.094
Oh, your mother's long gone, princess.

27:59.516 --> 28:00.612
Piece of advice...

28:00.637 --> 28:03.505
Next time you want to tail someone,

28:04.047 --> 28:06.241
learn how to do it better first.

28:06.310 --> 28:07.985
Come on. Let's get out of here.

28:08.180 --> 28:09.911
Run ahead, Drizella.

28:10.013 --> 28:13.148
Mother Gothel needs a moment.

28:13.389 --> 28:14.716
Fine.

28:14.785 --> 28:17.535
Talk until the sun sets if you want.

28:17.560 --> 28:20.222
That one speaks too much.

28:21.784 --> 28:22.835
Indeed.

28:22.860 --> 28:26.595
But she's really bought into your, um...

28:26.697 --> 28:29.277
maternal routine.

28:29.302 --> 28:32.177
Why is it you call
yourself "Mother Gothel"?

28:32.202 --> 28:34.503
I mean, y-y-you're no mother to them.

28:34.605 --> 28:37.272
And you're certainly no nun.

28:37.374 --> 28:40.976
"Mother" means different
things to different people.

28:42.415 --> 28:44.640
I tend to their needs,

28:44.665 --> 28:46.558
as I can tend to yours.

28:47.551 --> 28:49.084
I'm fine, thanks.

28:49.610 --> 28:51.153
Are you?

28:51.221 --> 28:54.756
Because life seems to
have you glum nowadays.

28:54.825 --> 28:58.593
I never thought I'd see
a pout on the Dark One.

28:58.662 --> 29:01.563
Nor love in his heart.

29:01.632 --> 29:03.999
No, I suppose it's a time for firsts.

29:04.101 --> 29:05.834
How is Belle, by the way?

29:05.936 --> 29:08.870
Don't you dare... say her name.

29:08.939 --> 29:12.274
Ooh, that struck a nerve.

29:12.376 --> 29:14.709
You know you're never
getting back to her.

29:15.151 --> 29:17.317
Not on your own.

29:17.342 --> 29:18.513
But with me...

29:18.615 --> 29:20.816
No, no. I don't serve anyone.

29:21.472 --> 29:23.518
There's nothing you
can do to stop Belfrey

29:23.620 --> 29:25.814
from waking Anastasia now.

29:25.839 --> 29:29.858
Rapunzel, Lady Tremaine,
Victoria Belfrey,

29:29.960 --> 29:33.395
whatever role she's assuming today...

29:33.497 --> 29:37.966
You neglected to ask her the
cost of what she hopes to do.

29:38.068 --> 29:39.267
Why is that?

29:39.369 --> 29:41.002
Well, you tell me.

29:41.104 --> 29:43.405
Reawakening Belfrey's
biddy is going to cost

29:43.507 --> 29:46.975
the loss of an innocent's belief.

29:47.077 --> 29:49.778
If you want to tell me something,

29:49.880 --> 29:52.180
why don't you just say it?

29:52.282 --> 29:55.083
Do you have any idea...

29:55.185 --> 29:58.753
where your great-granddaughter
is right now?

30:02.492 --> 30:04.392
Grandma?

30:04.494 --> 30:06.261
What are you doing
here? My mom texted me.

30:06.363 --> 30:07.429
Yes, I know.

30:07.531 --> 30:09.297
I'm having your things
sent over to her place,

30:09.399 --> 30:12.100
but I-I wanted to give
you something myself.

30:12.202 --> 30:13.668
I think I should probably go.

30:13.770 --> 30:15.270
Wait. I have it right here.

30:20.577 --> 30:21.476
Is that...?

30:21.578 --> 30:23.812
Yes. You were right, Lucy.

30:24.748 --> 30:27.182
Fairy tales are real.

30:27.207 --> 30:28.850
Henry's book was real.

30:28.952 --> 30:32.487
Your family, your
belief... it's all real.

30:33.457 --> 30:35.590
But you don't know the whole story.

30:35.692 --> 30:38.093
Come now. I'll tell you the rest.

30:45.427 --> 30:48.789
So, wait, it's true? You're Rapunzel?!

30:48.930 --> 30:50.982
I thought you were Lady Tremaine,

30:51.084 --> 30:52.951
but Rapunzel, too?!

30:53.019 --> 30:54.285
Tremaine was Marcus' name.

30:54.354 --> 30:56.387
I took it from him when we were married.

30:56.456 --> 30:59.290
My mom... she is Cinderella.

30:59.359 --> 31:01.125
I-I... I knew it! I was right!

31:01.194 --> 31:03.361
Yes, and it's that unfettered belief

31:03.430 --> 31:04.796
that makes you so special.

31:08.134 --> 31:09.334
Wait.

31:10.476 --> 31:12.704
You poisoned my mom's mom?

31:13.219 --> 31:16.074
The witch tricked me,
Lucy. She twisted the truth.

31:16.467 --> 31:19.511
I was blinded by what was in my heart.

31:19.579 --> 31:21.246
I needed my family to be together again.

31:21.348 --> 31:23.214
You must understand that.

31:26.586 --> 31:29.354
So... she died?

31:29.422 --> 31:31.503
No. Gosh, no.

31:31.528 --> 31:34.192
I could never hurt
somebody like that, Lucy.

31:34.294 --> 31:36.386
I knew the poison would only cause

31:36.436 --> 31:37.835
Ella's mother to flee.

31:37.904 --> 31:41.839
What I didn't know was that
Marcus would chase after her...

31:41.941 --> 31:43.142
to Wonderland.

31:43.619 --> 31:45.042
Eventually, he returned,

31:45.145 --> 31:47.545
and we were reunited as a family.

31:47.614 --> 31:49.313
We even welcomed your mother in.

31:49.382 --> 31:52.984
Unfortunately, the
story didn't end there.

31:59.893 --> 32:01.225
There were moments in the tower

32:01.250 --> 32:03.052
when all of this seemed so unlikely.

32:03.077 --> 32:05.029
The three of them truly
do seem like sisters.

32:08.190 --> 32:09.874
I'll get it.

32:10.345 --> 32:11.653
I've been thinking a lot

32:11.722 --> 32:13.688
about how much you've
done for our family.

32:17.327 --> 32:19.694
Sacrifice is the ultimate form of love.

32:19.763 --> 32:22.430
Hey, Ella.

32:22.532 --> 32:25.900
It... It's humbled me.

32:25.969 --> 32:29.404
It's now my turn to show you
just how much I value you.

32:57.501 --> 32:59.234
He'll get her.

32:59.336 --> 33:00.902
He'll get her.

33:11.314 --> 33:13.148
That's Ella.

33:13.216 --> 33:14.482
Where's our daughter?!

33:14.584 --> 33:15.717
Where's Anastasia?

33:15.819 --> 33:18.153
She's... I couldn't.

33:18.221 --> 33:19.869
I could only grab one.

33:24.918 --> 33:26.284
Is that...?

33:26.463 --> 33:29.297
Yes. Anastasia.

33:35.272 --> 33:38.173
Why are you showing me this?

33:38.562 --> 33:41.443
I need you to see how
the world really is,

33:41.511 --> 33:43.244
even for the people in this book.

33:44.973 --> 33:46.514
What are you talking about?

33:46.583 --> 33:50.919
I only ever did what the heroes
you so often speak of would do.

33:51.021 --> 33:53.521
I sacrificed everything for my family.

33:54.528 --> 33:57.841
And the only thing I ever
got in return was pain.

33:58.762 --> 34:00.762
You were right, Lucy...
Fairy tales are real.

34:00.864 --> 34:03.598
But sadly... happy endings aren't.

34:03.700 --> 34:04.699
No.

34:04.768 --> 34:06.267
Good people can get happy endings

34:06.369 --> 34:08.136
when they work at it.

34:08.205 --> 34:10.071
My family's story is different.

34:10.139 --> 34:11.406
I am your family.

34:11.475 --> 34:12.639
No, you're not!

34:12.742 --> 34:14.775
My family's me, my mom, and Henry,

34:14.844 --> 34:16.344
and... and we'll all be together.

34:16.446 --> 34:17.411
I believe it.

34:17.514 --> 34:19.280
Well, I believed it, too.

34:20.002 --> 34:22.449
For far too long.

34:24.387 --> 34:25.887
And...

34:25.956 --> 34:28.089
it's already too late, Lucy.

34:31.745 --> 34:34.646
Henry means nothing to your mother.

34:36.800 --> 34:38.266
No.

34:44.040 --> 34:47.375
Your story and mine...

34:47.476 --> 34:49.210
we're the same.

34:49.279 --> 34:51.779
Separated from those we love,

34:51.882 --> 34:53.581
willing to do anything to reunite.

34:53.683 --> 34:55.550
But I'm back with my mom now.

34:55.652 --> 34:58.319
And not Henry.

34:58.421 --> 35:01.456
He left town. He's gone.

35:01.558 --> 35:03.458
And no matter how strongly you believed,

35:03.560 --> 35:06.427
you failed to make him stay.

35:06.496 --> 35:10.632
When your beliefs betray
you, you must let them go.

35:12.702 --> 35:16.437
Lucy, it's time.

35:16.540 --> 35:18.740
Let your belief go.

35:49.761 --> 35:53.806
You have to help her.
She fell through the ice.

35:54.533 --> 35:56.560
She was trying to save someone.

35:56.629 --> 35:59.363
What a terrible waste
of a promising soul.

36:02.201 --> 36:03.200
What are you doing?

36:03.303 --> 36:04.936
Locking in her last breath.

36:05.038 --> 36:06.437
As long as it remains in her lungs,

36:06.539 --> 36:08.339
she hangs between life and death.

36:10.109 --> 36:12.510
Thank you. She's my everything.

36:13.846 --> 36:15.413
Unfortunately, gratitude alone

36:15.481 --> 36:17.748
will not be enough to reawaken her.

36:19.152 --> 36:21.585
This time, Anastasia's
going into the tower.

36:21.688 --> 36:24.021
What? She's done nothing wrong.

36:24.123 --> 36:26.023
You still haven't realized.

36:26.092 --> 36:28.960
This was never a
punishment. This was a test.

36:29.062 --> 36:30.328
A test?

36:30.396 --> 36:33.664
For long, I've sought after
a hero pure of heart...

36:33.766 --> 36:34.699
The Guardian.

36:34.767 --> 36:36.434
Someone incorruptible by evil,

36:36.536 --> 36:37.735
willing to sacrifice.

36:37.837 --> 36:39.203
The tower.

36:39.305 --> 36:40.705
The poison.

36:40.773 --> 36:43.107
When you accepted suffering
to save your family,

36:43.176 --> 36:45.643
I thought you had the
potential to be The Guardian.

36:45.678 --> 36:47.812
But you couldn't resist the temptation

36:47.880 --> 36:50.181
to harm an innocent.

36:50.216 --> 36:54.285
Perhaps someone else in your
bloodline will do better.

36:54.988 --> 36:56.887
You put her in that tower,

36:56.956 --> 36:58.823
and I will scale it brick by brick

36:58.925 --> 37:00.491
if that's what it takes.

37:00.593 --> 37:02.493
I'm sure you would.

37:02.562 --> 37:03.527
But since your escape,

37:03.596 --> 37:06.597
I made a few
improvements... blood magic,

37:06.699 --> 37:09.233
to keep the next occupant entrapped.

37:11.871 --> 37:14.739
Say goodbye to your little girl.

37:18.591 --> 37:19.984
Looking for something?

37:24.050 --> 37:26.917
- No.
- Do it when they least expect.

37:27.020 --> 37:28.352
Isn't that what you told me?

37:28.421 --> 37:29.620
No.

37:41.934 --> 37:44.602
Don't worry, my dearest. I promise...

37:44.704 --> 37:46.469
I will bring you back.

38:01.020 --> 38:02.453
- Any sign of her?
- Not yet, sir.

38:02.555 --> 38:03.921
But we found this here.

38:05.892 --> 38:07.792
Are you sure you don't want
us to reach out to her mother?

38:07.860 --> 38:10.694
That's the one place I
know she won't be found.

38:17.904 --> 38:20.504
- Keep searching.
- Yes, sir.

38:20.529 --> 38:22.543
And remember...

38:23.276 --> 38:24.842
you report only to me on this matter.

38:24.944 --> 38:25.976
Understood.

38:29.449 --> 38:31.182
I really don't have
time for you right now.

38:31.284 --> 38:32.483
Well, make time.

38:34.054 --> 38:36.020
Who the hell are you looking for?

38:37.123 --> 38:41.492
This is my business, and,
therefore, none of yours.

38:41.826 --> 38:45.436
Says the guy questioning
witnesses in my case.

38:45.531 --> 38:47.598
I've been in your locker.

38:47.700 --> 38:50.298
You have files on half
of Hyperion Heights.

38:50.323 --> 38:52.036
Now, I can't tell if you're a dirty cop

38:52.138 --> 38:54.038
or the best one I know.

38:54.073 --> 38:55.439
One minute, you're
speaking to me in riddles.

38:55.508 --> 38:58.454
The next... the next,
you're shutting me out.

38:58.479 --> 39:00.544
Yet I can't shake the feeling

39:00.813 --> 39:02.824
that there's something
that you want to tell me,

39:02.849 --> 39:04.882
so spit it out!

39:06.252 --> 39:08.119
I'm looking for someone.

39:08.774 --> 39:11.322
Much as you were with Eloise Gardener.

39:11.424 --> 39:13.257
What does Belfrey have to do with that?

39:13.326 --> 39:15.392
I thought she could help me.

39:15.495 --> 39:16.994
I was wrong.

39:20.500 --> 39:22.685
Look, this is...

39:23.236 --> 39:26.937
this is really hard to put into words.

39:27.512 --> 39:30.774
But I've been separated from my wife...

39:30.877 --> 39:32.409
Belle.

39:32.478 --> 39:36.680
And I would do anything to get to her.

39:36.749 --> 39:38.716
I don't know how else to put it.

39:38.784 --> 39:42.353
But this... all of this...

39:42.697 --> 39:44.622
is in service to that.

39:44.993 --> 39:47.224
That is the least believable
thing you've ever said to me.

39:47.806 --> 39:50.461
And yet... and yet I believe it.

39:53.432 --> 39:55.530
Just let me help you.

39:56.636 --> 39:58.068
Yeah, okay.

39:58.171 --> 40:00.271
So, what do we do now?

40:00.373 --> 40:01.667
Tonight.

40:03.075 --> 40:04.775
Find Lucy.

40:18.624 --> 40:20.057
Lucy!

40:22.061 --> 40:23.160
Lucy?

40:27.400 --> 40:28.732
What's wrong?

40:46.118 --> 40:47.418
Oh!

40:47.486 --> 40:48.986
No!

40:49.220 --> 40:51.755
Lucy! Lucy! Baby!

40:51.780 --> 40:53.513
Lucy, no, no, no!

40:58.931 --> 41:00.164
Mother?

41:01.734 --> 41:03.467
What... what happened?

41:05.494 --> 41:07.461
I saved you.

41:07.765 --> 41:11.100
Oh, my sweet Anastasia, I saved you!

41:12.004 --> 41:14.311
When it comes to my family,

41:14.380 --> 41:16.046
I always find a way.
