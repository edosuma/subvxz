00:32.531 --> 00:36.234
Miss,
think this through carefully.

00:36.269 --> 00:40.072
To drop the spear,
is to challenge us.

00:49.366 --> 00:51.867
Let's duel up close.

03:54.984 --> 03:57.117
Stay away! Stay away!

04:21.661 --> 04:23.428
He didn't lose his mind.

04:23.463 --> 04:26.364
It's pure anger.
He hates himself.

04:26.399 --> 04:29.367
He needs to be born again.

04:29.402 --> 04:32.971
Let him become
a monk in name only.

04:42.298 --> 04:45.516
Listen closely.
Write his name on a paper doll.

04:45.552 --> 04:49.287
It will take over
his identity as a monk.

04:49.322 --> 04:52.323
Then he will
vanish from the world.

05:05.372 --> 05:07.472
When you jump over the wall,

05:07.507 --> 05:12.977
the words spoken by the first person
you meet will be your new name.

05:13.012 --> 05:17.782
Brother, you will start
a new life with that name.

05:27.427 --> 05:30.228
Come back when you have one!

06:19.562 --> 06:21.345
Judge Archer!

06:41.200 --> 06:43.935
You! Who are you?

06:43.970 --> 06:46.087
- Judge Archer.
- You?

06:46.856 --> 06:49.440
Yes!

06:52.378 --> 06:53.744
Come here.

06:55.882 --> 06:58.316
Let me take a look at you.

07:11.548 --> 07:14.715
Judge Archer is my name as well.

07:15.885 --> 07:20.854
From now on, you and I
will share the same name.

07:39.492 --> 07:41.809
You have taken a cursed name.

07:41.844 --> 07:44.378
It has been used
for six generations.

07:44.413 --> 07:46.759
Nobody with this name
has met a good end.

07:46.783 --> 07:51.002
People who carry this name
have a duty to deliver justice.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.506
Han Si, what are you doing?

08:13.076 --> 08:14.708
No more waiting.

08:17.280 --> 08:20.998
Why not? Doesn't Judge Archer
mean anything to you?

08:22.602 --> 08:24.535
He disappeared three years ago.

08:24.570 --> 08:26.871
You said he'll come today.

08:26.906 --> 08:28.656
How can I trust you?

08:29.759 --> 08:32.727
Master Zhao, you have
your broadsword with you.

08:32.761 --> 08:36.447
Don't let a stranger step in.
We'll solve it ourselves.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.735
It's Judge Archer's signature.

09:33.105 --> 09:34.805
I don't know you.

09:35.908 --> 09:38.993
This is all you need to know.

09:47.453 --> 09:48.735
It's my fault.

09:48.771 --> 09:50.771
I'm sorry I bothered you.

09:50.806 --> 09:54.408
Good. And now
settle it over a cup of tea.

09:58.948 --> 10:02.016
- Let's forget what happened.
- It's over.

11:35.044 --> 11:37.394
Do not hold back now.

12:06.459 --> 12:10.327
With a single gold bar,
you can buy a whole house.

12:11.181 --> 12:13.147
I was afraid they wouldn't sell.

12:14.533 --> 12:16.867
Why'd he shoot
four arrows in a row?

12:16.902 --> 12:19.703
It's a tradition,
symbolizing justice.

12:19.738 --> 12:23.207
It's not easy to cluster
four arrows together.

12:23.242 --> 12:26.527
He can persuade others
with his precision alone.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.814
Just by pulling a bowstring,

12:29.849 --> 12:32.329
he can stop fights
between the schools?

12:33.102 --> 12:35.269
But you must remember

12:35.304 --> 12:38.239
that what they teach
is all trickery.

12:38.274 --> 12:40.758
That's how they
keep their students.

12:45.397 --> 12:47.798
After you've mastered archery,

12:49.535 --> 12:53.571
there is no secret
in martial arts.

12:53.606 --> 12:57.892
These two ligaments here are
essential in the art of archery.

12:59.478 --> 13:02.613
Always keep your chest out
and your waist in.

13:02.649 --> 13:06.300
And you can feel them
stretch when you pull the bow.

13:07.336 --> 13:11.505
He shows his strength
by pulling on the bow.

13:17.262 --> 13:21.615
You and I are working
together and it ends there.

13:22.785 --> 13:24.134
Hmm.

13:55.367 --> 13:58.402
He drank seven bottles
in four hours.

14:15.071 --> 14:17.872
Judge Archer
is respected by everyone.

14:17.907 --> 14:22.894
If he wants to get drunk, why
does he have to disguise himself?

14:24.797 --> 14:27.414
Oh, you have many enemies.

14:27.450 --> 14:30.701
For to deliver justice
is to make enemies.

14:36.359 --> 14:38.626
You cannot handle wine.

14:39.562 --> 14:42.947
You just want... to get drunk.

14:44.317 --> 14:48.536
The last Judge, your
predecessor, lasted seven years.

14:49.172 --> 14:51.338
How long can you last?

14:53.676 --> 14:56.009
Let's see if I survive tonight.

14:57.864 --> 15:00.847
I challenge you... up close.

15:38.120 --> 15:43.507
Get out of the way.
I'm crazy when I'm drunk.

17:03.589 --> 17:05.539
Stay away!

17:23.458 --> 17:24.942
What are you doing?

17:28.446 --> 17:30.314
It's my habit.

17:43.895 --> 17:47.631
I know this is a trap.
What do you want?

18:15.344 --> 18:18.746
I shouldn't have lied...
I'm sorry.

18:18.781 --> 18:22.449
I wanted to ask
if you could help me.

18:28.174 --> 18:34.078
I am Judge Archer. I am concerned
with martial arts... nothing more.

18:34.113 --> 18:39.817
I thought that if there was an
injustice, you would step forward.

18:39.852 --> 18:43.403
To be Judge Archer
is my destiny.

18:43.438 --> 18:45.906
It's the only purpose
of my life.

18:45.941 --> 18:48.591
I cannot afford
to make mistakes.

18:50.713 --> 18:52.879
I see that I was wrong.

18:53.716 --> 18:56.967
Leave... when you're finished.

19:02.991 --> 19:04.958
I want to ask one thing.

19:05.594 --> 19:07.728
Nothing happened...

19:09.448 --> 19:11.248
last night, right?

19:20.792 --> 19:22.072
Nothing.

19:25.931 --> 19:27.731
No one can bully me.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.784
We won't make a trade.

19:30.819 --> 19:34.088
But I can... help.

19:44.049 --> 19:49.486
<i>My father was a member of the
Tongmenghui Revolutionary Alliance.</i>

19:49.522 --> 19:51.188
<i>Most of its early members</i>

19:51.223 --> 19:54.191
<i>were forced into exile overseas,</i>

19:54.226 --> 19:56.860
<i>and many had
foreign lovers abroad.</i>

19:56.896 --> 20:00.196
<i>He died in a conflict
two years ago.</i>

20:01.534 --> 20:05.152
<i>The man who killed my father
is no longer in power.</i>

20:05.187 --> 20:09.640
<i>These days, he only leaves
his home twice a week,</i>

20:09.675 --> 20:13.410
<i>to go teach music class
at the village middle school.</i>

20:13.445 --> 20:17.514
Perhaps he has
repented his actions.

20:17.549 --> 20:20.583
Repentance cannot
change the past.

20:20.619 --> 20:23.002
My father will never
breathe again.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.798
Where is Kong?

20:36.868 --> 20:39.102
He sold me the store and left.

20:40.239 --> 20:43.490
We had a deal, he gives me
a pear every morning,

20:43.525 --> 20:45.158
and I pay every month.

20:52.801 --> 20:56.136
The smell of a pear in
the morning is very refreshing.

21:03.479 --> 21:06.596
You're not young anymore,
don't run.

21:06.631 --> 21:08.615
What if you'd tripped?

21:14.874 --> 21:18.308
To smell
is to practice breathing.

21:18.343 --> 21:24.148
His gait is clumsy, but gentle.
He must be a great master.

21:43.903 --> 21:48.622
I have shot at the target
ten times. Should I continue?

21:49.608 --> 21:52.726
And so what if you have?

21:52.761 --> 21:56.997
The energy of the tree continues
to overwhelm and overpower you.

21:57.833 --> 22:01.335
You are not brave enough
to face it.

22:02.187 --> 22:04.688
You think I'm scared of a tree?

22:05.790 --> 22:07.658
That's not what I said.

22:07.693 --> 22:12.012
An experienced archer will always
aim with his left foot forward,

22:12.047 --> 22:15.231
but look at your left foot,
it's shying away.

22:51.503 --> 22:53.169
Give me an apple.

22:55.074 --> 22:56.673
Just one apple?

23:58.604 --> 24:02.789
The essence of archery is not
concerned with the target,

24:02.824 --> 24:05.675
but with being at peace
with oneself.

24:12.117 --> 24:13.683
For the apple.

24:22.945 --> 24:24.444
But wait, it's too much.

24:24.479 --> 24:25.711
It's your tip.

24:25.747 --> 24:27.992
I can't accept it,
here's your change.

24:28.016 --> 24:29.282
Keep it.

24:31.920 --> 24:34.554
Guests are coming tonight.
Bring me a box of fruit.

24:34.589 --> 24:36.122
Yes, sir.

24:49.004 --> 24:51.254
She is really flirtatious.

24:53.241 --> 24:55.408
She must be a mistress.

24:55.444 --> 24:58.177
Or she will become one
sooner or later.

24:58.213 --> 25:01.982
Some rich man
will surely take her.

25:02.017 --> 25:05.836
The way she sings opera
is very seductive.

25:07.155 --> 25:11.224
<i>♪ The young man in blue
wearing a scarf ♪</i>

25:11.259 --> 25:14.995
<i>♪ Seems so gentle
and handsome ♪</i>

25:15.030 --> 25:19.299
<i>♪ He looks just
like my husband ♪</i>

25:19.334 --> 25:25.771
<i>♪ They look exactly the same ♪</i>

25:45.578 --> 25:47.343
We'll pay you later.

26:20.195 --> 26:21.339
What happened?

26:21.363 --> 26:23.212
You don't remember?

26:23.248 --> 26:25.515
I remember
it suddenly went dark.

26:25.551 --> 26:27.250
You passed out.

26:30.522 --> 26:34.524
It's singing opera,
it's making me feel so weak.

26:39.448 --> 26:41.248
Will you eat it?

26:51.260 --> 26:53.176
Don't you have a smaller knife?

27:07.776 --> 27:09.342
Don't look at me like that.

27:09.378 --> 27:13.563
Every female opera singer
carries a knife with her.

27:22.473 --> 27:25.742
The character in the opera
is so gentle and loving.

27:25.777 --> 27:28.628
Where is he in real life?

27:32.167 --> 27:34.150
He ripped my dress last night

27:35.020 --> 27:37.287
and left first thing
this morning.

27:38.823 --> 27:40.690
I walked back wearing his coat

27:40.725 --> 27:44.961
but he got very angry and told me
I had to return it immediately.

27:45.964 --> 27:48.714
He treated me like a thief.

28:01.630 --> 28:03.129
What's wrong?

28:15.543 --> 28:17.410
I'll leave you the knife.

28:17.445 --> 28:20.947
Come and watch my
performance tonight. No charge.

29:05.076 --> 29:09.111
This job... is not for me.

29:11.049 --> 29:15.402
You're being decent enough
by coming in person.

29:16.538 --> 29:18.004
Thank you.

29:47.936 --> 29:49.835
Can't you do better?

29:51.172 --> 29:53.089
That's the blunt edge.

30:14.713 --> 30:17.080
I'm a martial artist.

30:17.115 --> 30:20.166
I can choose...
to step in...

30:21.236 --> 30:22.668
or to stay out.

34:19.690 --> 34:21.190
Why did you do that?

34:22.260 --> 34:23.726
Master!

34:47.485 --> 34:48.985
Thank you.

35:06.971 --> 35:08.938
This is my room.

35:09.540 --> 35:11.840
I only reserved one.

35:12.310 --> 35:13.943
Book another.

35:17.715 --> 35:20.049
You deliver justice.

35:21.319 --> 35:25.955
And God will reward you.

36:25.550 --> 36:29.152
Maintaining justice
requires willpower.

36:30.955 --> 36:35.758
When someone overpowers me,
I have to defeat him.

36:35.793 --> 36:38.360
Or I can no longer be
Judge Archer.

36:41.832 --> 36:45.834
This time I fight for myself.

37:02.720 --> 37:05.220
You fight for yourself?

37:05.256 --> 37:07.356
And the last time?

40:17.882 --> 40:20.115
Would you like some soup?

41:07.698 --> 41:10.699
But why?
Why do I do it?

41:51.542 --> 41:53.275
How is your rich man?

41:54.545 --> 41:55.878
Very well.

41:57.015 --> 41:59.081
He should send a car for you.

42:01.519 --> 42:05.054
When he picked me up...
he sent one.

42:17.234 --> 42:19.168
I haven't seen you for days.

42:22.140 --> 42:23.873
Something came up.

42:53.337 --> 42:56.605
Leave it, I'll peel another one.

42:58.676 --> 43:03.579
Mister...
Can you hug me for a while?

43:05.283 --> 43:07.049
It's so cold.

43:52.062 --> 43:56.031
A skilled archer knows
you must keep your heart pure.

43:56.066 --> 44:00.035
If you can cut cleanly,
then you will treat others well.

44:04.541 --> 44:06.541
I don't want to go back.

44:08.179 --> 44:12.014
If you like me...
take me with you.

44:12.049 --> 44:14.717
You can buy me for 30 apples.

44:25.663 --> 44:28.897
Fifteen apples then.
Not one less.

44:54.192 --> 44:58.627
Remember, to deliver justice
is to make enemies.

45:00.698 --> 45:03.398
You must live like
a wanted criminal.

45:12.310 --> 45:13.809
Why there?

45:14.478 --> 45:16.178
It's a habit.

45:16.714 --> 45:18.180
Mmm.

45:26.690 --> 45:28.657
Here's my card.

45:34.865 --> 45:38.734
Wooden block printing.
It costs a lot.

45:40.037 --> 45:41.703
For paper?

45:43.573 --> 45:48.811
It is worth a hundred meals,
but it buys me higher status.

45:52.649 --> 45:56.151
Who's it from?
The rich man?

45:58.288 --> 46:00.288
I paid for it.

46:15.205 --> 46:16.671
Who are you?

46:21.312 --> 46:24.245
Look in the left sleeve.
Your hundred meals.

46:56.914 --> 47:00.482
No matter who you are,
you're my man from now on.

47:17.735 --> 47:20.436
The warlords are all
fighting amongst each other.

47:20.471 --> 47:22.571
Deserters and guns
are everywhere.

47:22.606 --> 47:26.041
Find a man
who has killed before.

47:29.847 --> 47:31.613
Where are you going?

47:41.825 --> 47:45.627
Leave the troupe.
Go pack your stuff.

47:47.832 --> 47:49.831
I'll take you with me.

47:53.503 --> 47:57.973
I'm no longer Judge Archer.
I'm free to leave.

48:54.632 --> 48:57.499
You see the gold bar
on the table?

48:57.535 --> 49:00.468
Now come in, and have a seat.

49:24.328 --> 49:28.263
Stop right there. I'll lose
a finger, but you'll die.

49:28.298 --> 49:30.799
You're too confident.

49:30.834 --> 49:34.436
My skills can solve
any martial arts' conflict.

49:34.471 --> 49:36.738
Knife-throwing
is crucial to archery.

49:36.773 --> 49:39.742
Do you trust my skills?

49:41.712 --> 49:43.578
Judge Archer.

49:58.095 --> 50:01.963
At 34, I became a master.

50:01.998 --> 50:05.934
I have been searching for someone
worthy of my assistance...

50:06.804 --> 50:08.737
for 30 years now.

50:10.507 --> 50:15.644
You've found him.
Commander Yang.

50:17.247 --> 50:23.885
He is in exile now, but I know
he'll return to power soon.

50:27.258 --> 50:30.425
I was asked to take revenge.

50:31.929 --> 50:34.195
He betrays his friends.

50:35.566 --> 50:41.937
Someone always gets hurt in
politics, martial arts are hard.

50:41.972 --> 50:45.541
It's even harder
to find your leader.

50:47.411 --> 50:49.878
I will not let you kill him.

51:15.305 --> 51:20.842
I always thought that it was
your energy that overwhelmed me.

51:21.845 --> 51:25.714
I never imagined
it would be her.

51:36.660 --> 51:40.128
I will let Yang go
on the condition

51:40.163 --> 51:46.501
that the woman who lied to me
dies by my hand.

51:52.575 --> 51:53.875
Deal!

52:02.619 --> 52:04.719
That man is my husband.

52:04.754 --> 52:07.422
I've stayed with him
for ten years.

52:11.628 --> 52:14.028
I will trade my life for Yang's.

52:14.064 --> 52:17.666
It's worth it, just do it.

52:42.726 --> 52:47.395
I'm a martial artist,
not a criminal.

52:48.865 --> 52:51.666
I've made many mistakes.

52:51.701 --> 52:59.174
Kong... he was a fruit vendor
in this village for many years.

52:59.209 --> 53:04.479
In just one day, the store
was sold and he had moved away.

53:06.383 --> 53:08.182
It didn't make any sense.

53:08.218 --> 53:14.256
So... you sent a woman
to spy on me.

53:35.345 --> 53:38.513
I am quite sure
that I can defeat you.

53:38.548 --> 53:42.517
But for the sake of
Commander Yang, I can't risk it.

53:55.499 --> 54:00.968
Eventually, I will find
justice for my wife.

54:12.382 --> 54:14.282
Get her body.

54:25.562 --> 54:30.231
Before you step outside, first
fit your face within the circle.

54:30.267 --> 54:33.268
If your ears align,
you are balanced.

54:33.303 --> 54:35.803
Otherwise,
you will lose your way.

54:35.838 --> 54:38.639
This is a means
of self-examination.

54:38.675 --> 54:42.310
You must keep it in mind
at all times.

55:29.759 --> 55:33.961
No! That is wrong. Never
look at the bow when aiming.

55:33.997 --> 55:35.831
You'll miss the target.

55:35.866 --> 55:37.632
Thanks for your advice.

55:38.669 --> 55:40.468
It's a pity
your great archery skills

55:40.504 --> 55:42.203
cannot help you
understand people.

55:42.239 --> 55:45.973
Rest your eyes on the bow
but on a woman also.

55:47.544 --> 55:52.013
The woman you love has been my
master's wife for ten years now.

55:54.551 --> 55:59.220
In the end, my ambitious master
has accomplished nothing.

55:59.256 --> 56:02.490
Commander Yang
is his final hope.

56:03.993 --> 56:05.360
If I kill Yang...

56:06.529 --> 56:09.030
it will destroy
our relationship.

56:09.066 --> 56:12.567
My parents
have already passed away.

56:12.602 --> 56:15.370
I have only my master left.

56:17.740 --> 56:19.541
Who is he?

56:21.945 --> 56:25.046
Ten years ago,
before my master met Yang,

56:25.081 --> 56:28.149
he turned the schools
upside down.

56:28.184 --> 56:32.087
The up-close duel is the
deadliest one in martial arts.

56:32.122 --> 56:35.790
My master excelled at it,
he was the very best.

56:38.428 --> 56:40.395
Kuang? Yimin?

56:40.431 --> 56:45.833
Be careful.
I have surpassed him.

57:28.244 --> 57:31.345
Break both of his hands
and dump his body.

57:35.586 --> 57:37.285
I'll do it.

58:06.015 --> 58:11.052
<i>When I die, don't mark the
grave or put up a tombstone.</i>

58:11.088 --> 58:13.721
<i>Just bury me in the weeds.</i>

58:15.626 --> 58:18.326
<i>You have only learned
how to shoot arrows,</i>

58:18.361 --> 58:21.530
<i>not how to deal with
returning arrows.</i>

58:21.565 --> 58:24.832
<i>It is a shame
that I cannot teach you.</i>

59:04.007 --> 59:05.807
Leave him, he's mine.

59:22.192 --> 59:24.726
I have brought your bow for you.

59:30.600 --> 59:34.435
The orphanage
is a sanctuary for runaways.

59:34.471 --> 59:39.274
You and me,
we can stay here forever.

59:39.309 --> 59:42.777
Martial artists
solve everything with Kung Fu.

59:42.813 --> 59:45.713
If I can defeat you,
you stay here.

59:49.419 --> 59:51.318
It's a deal.

59:53.790 --> 59:55.323
You cannot win.

59:55.359 --> 59:57.792
The ligaments
in your hand will break.

59:59.663 --> 01:00:01.429
Stop talking.

01:00:26.689 --> 01:00:30.191
Your hands... are useless.

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:32.760
I use my elbow.

01:00:36.333 --> 01:00:40.268
With no strain on my hand.
I have done this for years.

01:00:45.775 --> 01:00:49.877
An arrow can never return
once it's been shot

01:00:49.912 --> 01:00:51.846
but people can.

01:00:53.783 --> 01:00:58.153
I had almost forgot
that I still have a home.

01:01:49.973 --> 01:01:53.107
Commander Yang,
I can't walk with you today.

01:01:57.314 --> 01:01:58.946
What happened?

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:05.586
Fine then.

01:03:46.255 --> 01:03:49.256
You are the one
who taught me how to smoke.

01:03:49.292 --> 01:03:51.625
And you told me
that when a man gets frightened,

01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:54.862
he will smell so bad
that you can't stand it.

01:03:54.898 --> 01:03:56.730
He has lost his powers.

01:03:56.765 --> 01:03:58.966
Someone's still
worried about him.

01:04:02.438 --> 01:04:05.206
You joined Commander Liu's side?

01:04:05.242 --> 01:04:07.908
He is not one of the best.

01:04:11.247 --> 01:04:14.214
No one is perfect
in times of chaos.

01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:16.483
Is Commander Yang the best?

01:04:33.403 --> 01:04:37.838
I promise to kill Yang fairly,
out of respect for you.

01:04:37.874 --> 01:04:41.108
You and I will compete
in Kung Fu for his life.

01:04:41.143 --> 01:04:44.545
If you lose,
you must accept his fate.

01:04:49.585 --> 01:04:51.586
You were my protégé.

01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:57.091
But I taught myself
something better.

01:05:33.096 --> 01:05:35.162
Let's do spears.

01:06:05.995 --> 01:06:07.861
Get ready...

01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:10.798
I never taught you this.

01:06:29.251 --> 01:06:32.953
It's from our ancestors,
you understand?

01:06:36.392 --> 01:06:38.126
Watch carefully.

01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:51.472
In martial arts,
I made a huge mistake.

01:06:52.808 --> 01:06:57.011
For your sake I hope you choose...
the right master.

01:07:17.833 --> 01:07:21.269
Your house collapsed
many years ago.

01:07:21.304 --> 01:07:26.841
Empty houses
collapse the fastest.

01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:29.977
And my sister...
where did she go?

01:07:31.781 --> 01:07:33.213
It was very unfortunate.

01:07:33.249 --> 01:07:37.985
She was raped by Landlord Wang
in front of the villagers.

01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:40.821
She wanted to keep
her marriage a secret.

01:07:40.857 --> 01:07:44.158
She felt ashamed,
so we didn't ask.

01:09:31.234 --> 01:09:35.236
Sister... this is how
I learned archery.

01:09:37.038 --> 01:09:39.907
Spare my life!
Spare my life! Spare my life!

01:09:39.942 --> 01:09:42.475
Spare my life! Spare my life!

01:09:44.714 --> 01:09:48.282
Spare my life!

01:09:50.986 --> 01:09:53.453
I don't deserve
to be your executioner.

01:09:53.488 --> 01:09:58.058
To my sister,
I am even worse than you.

01:10:03.732 --> 01:10:06.300
Spare my life! Spare my life!

01:10:06.335 --> 01:10:07.968
Spare my life!

01:10:44.239 --> 01:10:48.509
<i>Brother...
it hasn't been easy for you.</i>

01:10:48.544 --> 01:10:53.514
<i>Please bless me.
Help me find my sister.</i>

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:17.104
Commander Yang has already contacted
all of his former troops.

01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:20.241
Things will go smoothly.

01:11:20.276 --> 01:11:23.677
You've helped me a lot,
so I'll do you a favor.

01:11:25.882 --> 01:11:28.849
I'll find Judge Archer...
for you.

01:11:33.989 --> 01:11:35.923
I'm your wife.

01:11:38.561 --> 01:11:40.928
You were never my wife.

01:11:42.598 --> 01:11:47.268
For ten years...
you were my servant.

01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:03.283
When I'm gone
accompany Yang to the school.

01:12:04.419 --> 01:12:05.919
Thank you.

01:12:10.793 --> 01:12:12.793
You're welcome.

01:13:32.441 --> 01:13:34.074
No one will step forward?

01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:35.508
You want to fight?

01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:53.460
Where is he?

01:15:54.917 --> 01:15:57.651
<i>Perhaps my sister never existed.</i>

01:15:58.787 --> 01:16:01.088
<i>But she led me to my true self.</i>

01:16:02.325 --> 01:16:04.758
<i>She is a revelation from Buddha.</i>

01:16:06.162 --> 01:16:09.997
<i>Sister... take care.</i>

01:17:13.996 --> 01:17:16.896
You left.
Why have you returned?

01:17:21.036 --> 01:17:25.639
There are few Kung Fu masters left,
and they will only become rarer.

01:17:26.608 --> 01:17:30.210
I just want a one-on-one duel.

01:17:30.245 --> 01:17:34.080
There are no masters left,
we're nobody.

01:17:35.418 --> 01:17:40.988
What you want,
is to take her with you.

01:20:55.551 --> 01:20:58.251
My master has
lost his leader again.

01:20:58.254 --> 01:21:01.721
There will never be
another Judge Archer.

01:22:29.611 --> 01:22:33.813
At 21,
I was so proud of my abilities.

01:22:33.848 --> 01:22:37.683
I expected to become
a great leader one day.

01:22:37.719 --> 01:22:42.456
At 34, I realized that
I would never succeed.

01:22:42.491 --> 01:22:46.393
And so I decided that I would
help someone else succeed,

01:22:46.428 --> 01:22:51.498
but all the people I met were
either incompetent or unfortunate.

01:22:53.101 --> 01:22:55.034
Why is this so?

01:22:55.069 --> 01:23:00.407
Yang's death has made me realize
that it is because I myself

01:23:00.442 --> 01:23:05.811
have neither the talent
nor the luck to be successful.

01:23:05.847 --> 01:23:09.282
All I have now is Kung Fu!

01:23:11.019 --> 01:23:13.086
I am 60 years old.

01:23:13.121 --> 01:23:16.556
I haven't done anything
serious for a while.

01:23:16.592 --> 01:23:18.536
These days,
it seems that everyone

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:21.961
is looking for a faster way
to do everything,

01:23:21.996 --> 01:23:28.234
but there is no shortcut in martial
arts and there never will be.

01:23:28.270 --> 01:23:32.839
I am looking forward...
to a duel with you.

01:23:41.617 --> 01:23:43.149
Yes.

01:26:48.770 --> 01:26:50.569
You could've
killed him just then!

01:26:53.775 --> 01:26:57.810
As long as he is alive, he won't
give up on finding another Yang.

01:26:59.113 --> 01:27:01.125
I've been with him
for many years.

01:27:01.149 --> 01:27:03.149
As long as he is alive,

01:27:03.184 --> 01:27:05.718
I have no choice
but to stay with him.

01:28:03.878 --> 01:28:05.178
What is it?

01:28:06.414 --> 01:28:08.581
Stealing a glance.
