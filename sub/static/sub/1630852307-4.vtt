WEBVTT

00:01.088 --> 00:03.699
- Mission-- get Dennis
to this retreat.

00:03.742 --> 00:06.223
- He has two Versace robes
at Porsha's house

00:06.267 --> 00:07.485
that he really wants back.

00:07.529 --> 00:09.313
- There it is.
Oh, my God, look.

00:10.880 --> 00:13.317
- Previously, on
"Porsha's Family Matters"...

00:13.361 --> 00:15.232
Lauren said that
you should come on the trip.

00:15.276 --> 00:16.494
- Yeah?

00:16.538 --> 00:19.671
- And I think she mentioned
Dennis comin'.

00:19.715 --> 00:21.151
- I-- I'm fine with it.

00:23.719 --> 00:26.374
- I came because the trip
was important for PJ's sake.

00:28.202 --> 00:29.681
- Mexico,
Mexico, Mexico.

00:29.725 --> 00:31.553
- Dom walked by me,
and he was like,

00:31.596 --> 00:34.730
"Why they got me
carrying Dennis' robe?"

00:34.773 --> 00:36.340
- Don't miss that flight
in the morning.

00:36.384 --> 00:37.689
- I won't miss it.

00:37.733 --> 00:39.735
- Did you put somethin'
sexy in your bag?

00:39.778 --> 00:41.780
- Dom is carrying
around a robe.

00:41.824 --> 00:43.217
- What do you care
about this robe?

00:43.260 --> 00:44.653
- Yeah, give me a robe.
- It is the principle of it.

00:44.696 --> 00:46.829
- Storm, you don't
know what's going on.

00:46.872 --> 00:48.091
Stay out of it.

00:48.135 --> 00:49.397
- Oh, my God.
- Or what?

00:49.440 --> 00:51.703
Or what?
What are you gonna do?

00:51.747 --> 00:56.186
- No, you're not standing up.

00:56.230 --> 00:58.275
- We're not gonna get anywhere
talking about a robe!

00:58.319 --> 00:59.755
- Yo, waiter!

00:59.798 --> 01:01.626
- Stop talking about the robe.
- I need a waiter.

01:01.670 --> 01:02.758
- Stop talking about it.

01:02.801 --> 01:04.716
If anyone says,
"Robe," again, go home!

01:04.760 --> 01:06.544
We are trying to
bring us together.

01:06.588 --> 01:08.503
We did what we had to do
to bring him here.

01:08.546 --> 01:12.855
No, wait.
Let me finish!

01:12.898 --> 01:13.899
What we're gonna do,
is we're going to

01:13.943 --> 01:14.900
look at ourselves

01:14.944 --> 01:16.380
and stop
pointing the finger.

01:16.424 --> 01:17.468
It's not about blame.

01:17.512 --> 01:19.340
Look at yourself.

01:19.383 --> 01:20.863
- Can I get a waitress?
- I will restart.

01:20.906 --> 01:23.561
I apologize, family,
if it feels like

01:23.605 --> 01:25.128
I am throwing blame.

01:25.172 --> 01:27.826
- Apologize?
- I apologize.

01:27.870 --> 01:29.915
- Okay.
- I did not mean to

01:29.959 --> 01:32.701
throw anything on anyone,

01:32.744 --> 01:35.225
but what I really would
love to know,

01:35.269 --> 01:37.227
everybody's true intention

01:37.271 --> 01:40.665
because I know it can't
possibly be about an item

01:40.709 --> 01:43.407
that was somewhere
or somebody gotta be bribed.

01:43.451 --> 01:49.152
Nobody has to be--

01:49.196 --> 01:50.110
- I'm listening.

01:50.153 --> 01:53.200
I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

01:53.243 --> 01:56.246
- One of the highest forms
of communication is silence,

01:56.290 --> 02:00.250
so let's practice therapeutic
compassionate listening,

02:00.294 --> 02:03.819
and whoever has this
may use their throat chakra

02:03.862 --> 02:08.432
to share what their intention is
and what they have to say.

02:08.476 --> 02:11.261
- Lena is lost
in black folk land,

02:11.305 --> 02:14.743
and she doesn't know
what to do about it.

02:14.786 --> 02:17.572
Danger, danger, danger.

02:17.615 --> 02:18.790
- Okay.

02:18.834 --> 02:20.836
- Okay, my whole intention
for this trip

02:20.879 --> 02:27.930
is that I have discovered...

02:27.973 --> 02:30.802
in the last three months,

02:30.846 --> 02:35.503
I have discovered
who I truly am,

02:35.546 --> 02:43.337
and for the first time...

02:43.380 --> 02:47.297
I would look at--
at feet, and say,

02:47.341 --> 02:49.647
"Boy, I wish I had some feet
that look like that.

02:49.691 --> 02:51.301
You know, the toes down.

02:51.345 --> 02:55.392
They're just so evenly spread,
and it's so beautiful."

02:55.436 --> 02:59.440
- Yo, I had to look
and see what's going on.

02:59.483 --> 03:02.573
I didn't know what this--
it looked pretty normal to me,

03:02.617 --> 03:05.794
but I--
I mean, I don't know.

03:05.837 --> 03:06.925
- Okay.

03:06.969 --> 03:13.715
- As I grew up,
my family, they said...

03:13.758 --> 03:15.891
They look like Barney Rubble
in Flintstone

03:15.934 --> 03:18.589
like in the car with your feet
just on the ground

03:18.633 --> 03:21.940
touching all the time.

03:21.984 --> 03:27.032
And the other main reason
why I'm here today

03:27.076 --> 03:29.731
because I have a daughter
sittin' right over there.

03:29.774 --> 03:31.036
- Mm-hmm.

03:31.080 --> 03:33.604
- And I would like to be
so much closer to her.

03:33.648 --> 03:36.259
I love you with
everything I have.

03:36.303 --> 03:46.617
- Aww.
- Thank you.

03:46.661 --> 03:50.447
- Storm and her mom have
had a lotta ups and downs.

03:50.491 --> 03:53.363
You know, there is
no parenting manual,

03:53.407 --> 03:56.366
and as a mom, as a dad,

03:56.410 --> 03:58.368
you really just do
the best you can.

03:58.412 --> 04:00.544
You will definitely have
some shortcomings

04:00.588 --> 04:02.546
and trust and believe
your teenager

04:02.590 --> 04:04.548
or your 23-year-old
is gonna be the main one

04:04.592 --> 04:09.466
to let you know
what the hell a shortcoming is.

04:09.510 --> 04:11.076
- I-I wanna make this quick.

04:11.120 --> 04:13.035
I don't-I don't know
why I'm here anymore.

04:13.078 --> 04:15.037
- Mmm.

04:15.080 --> 04:22.349
- And I don't
know these people.

04:22.392 --> 04:27.397
And how these people
claim they're in the family.

04:27.441 --> 04:28.746
What is the family?

04:28.790 --> 04:31.053
And maybe
I'm in another family.

04:31.096 --> 04:32.097
- Mmm.

04:32.141 --> 04:34.926
- 'Cause you're
not in my family.

04:34.970 --> 04:37.886
I don't even know you,

04:37.929 --> 04:40.541
and the only person
at this table

04:40.584 --> 04:43.979
that's in my family
may be Londie,

04:44.022 --> 04:46.460
and I was trying to
get to know you.

04:46.503 --> 04:47.852
- Mmm.

04:47.896 --> 04:50.333
- There's a distance between us
because the people

04:50.377 --> 04:55.382
you guys are calling family
I don't even know them.

04:55.425 --> 04:57.601
- Because Lauren and I
are so close,

04:57.645 --> 04:59.124
we have our circle.

04:59.168 --> 05:03.128
Dom is Lauren's best friend,
and Lauren's best friend,

05:03.172 --> 05:05.609
and he's also become
very close to me

05:05.653 --> 05:07.437
after working for me.
So-so, that's--

05:07.481 --> 05:10.832
- Okay, well,
I didn't even know that.

05:10.875 --> 05:12.703
- What's happening?

05:12.747 --> 05:14.096
Feels like we kidnapped her

05:14.139 --> 05:15.880
and brought her here
to this dinner,

05:15.924 --> 05:17.665
and she's like,
"Wait, what am I doing here?

05:17.708 --> 05:19.710
Who is these people?
What's happening?"

05:19.754 --> 05:21.973
So, I'm about as confused
as she is.

05:22.017 --> 05:23.366
- You have to understand that

05:23.410 --> 05:25.020
there are different levels
of knowing.

05:25.063 --> 05:27.631
I don't know Storm.
I don't know Darlene, really.

05:27.675 --> 05:30.112
We're pleasant
in each other's company,

05:30.155 --> 05:33.463
but we would never go out
and have drinks

05:33.507 --> 05:37.032
and hang out close.

05:37.075 --> 05:38.816
- What's that?
Chilean sea bass?

05:38.860 --> 05:39.991
- Yeah, it looks like sea bass.

05:40.035 --> 05:40.905
- Thank you.

05:40.949 --> 05:42.690
- Spicy hot?
Okay, I like it.

05:42.733 --> 05:45.649
- Pass that lobster.

05:45.693 --> 05:49.827
- Get it. Get it.
Get it.

05:49.871 --> 05:50.828
- Uh-oh.

05:50.872 --> 05:52.439
- I needed to leave the room

05:52.482 --> 05:55.006
because the smell
of the shellfish

05:55.050 --> 05:56.399
was just
overwhelming.

05:56.443 --> 05:57.705
I can't eat that.

05:57.748 --> 05:59.576
Some people probably thought,
yeah, I got up

05:59.620 --> 06:01.970
because I didn't wanna be
around 'em anymore.

06:02.013 --> 06:03.580
I probably would
think that myself.

06:05.452 --> 06:07.018
- Dennis, are you ready to
talk about your intentions?

06:07.062 --> 06:08.106
- Should give it to Storm.

06:08.150 --> 06:11.022
- Oh, yes, give it to Storm.
- Yep.

06:11.066 --> 06:12.589
- Thank you.

06:12.633 --> 06:15.026
I don't really have much to say,
but since I got the stick,

06:15.070 --> 06:18.160
I think that there are
some people at this table

06:18.203 --> 06:20.858
that have problems with me.

06:20.902 --> 06:22.120
Um...

06:22.164 --> 06:23.513
- You should tell your mama
you love her.

06:23.557 --> 06:24.558
She just come up here and
poured your hearts out,

06:24.601 --> 06:25.689
and you're talking
about yourself.

06:25.733 --> 06:26.864
- I'm a-I'm a--
I'm gonna get to that,

06:26.908 --> 06:27.604
but see, you ain't
'posed to be talking right now

06:27.648 --> 06:28.866
'cause I got the stick.

06:28.910 --> 06:30.259
- You don't have the stick.
You don't have--

06:30.302 --> 06:31.608
- I'm keepin' it real.
- Gotcha. You can't talk.

06:31.652 --> 06:32.653
- I would like to cultivate
some relationships

06:32.696 --> 06:34.698
that's actually real
like the other ones

06:34.742 --> 06:37.658
that I have with some people
at the table.

06:37.701 --> 06:40.617
I don't got nothin' else to say.

06:40.661 --> 06:41.705
- Do you wanna
give your intentions?

06:41.749 --> 06:43.446
- Yeah.
- You ready?

06:43.490 --> 06:45.535
- Yeah, sure.

06:45.579 --> 06:47.450
It's very important.

06:47.494 --> 06:53.238
This family is-is broken,
and, uh, that's very clear.

06:53.282 --> 06:54.849
I'm not trying to
single out Porsha,

06:54.892 --> 06:57.199
but it really starts with Porsha
because I'm just saying

06:57.242 --> 06:58.853
she's the head of this family.

06:58.896 --> 07:02.900
My intention on this trip--
build a relationship with Simon,

07:02.944 --> 07:06.556
so we can start our process
of co-parenting.

07:06.600 --> 07:07.644
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

07:07.688 --> 07:09.254
- You know,
I'm here to support,

07:09.298 --> 07:10.734
you know, Porsha because,
at the end of the day,

07:10.778 --> 07:12.736
it's about her being happy.

07:12.780 --> 07:15.522
Y'all feel me down there?
Storm, right?

07:15.565 --> 07:19.090
But we gotta come to the table
about, like, truth,

07:19.134 --> 07:21.571
and honesty,
and accountability.

07:21.615 --> 07:23.007
- Accountability
starts with yourself.

07:23.051 --> 07:24.139
- Hey, okay.

07:24.182 --> 07:25.445
- When I got--
when I got the stick--

07:25.488 --> 07:26.924
- No, but you can't be negative
with the stick.

07:26.968 --> 07:28.143
- When I got the stick,
you shouldn't talk.

07:28.186 --> 07:29.536
- You're the grownup!

07:29.579 --> 07:30.667
You're the older one!
- Okay.

07:30.711 --> 07:32.060
- You should
learn to be quiet.

07:32.103 --> 07:34.802
You shouldn't be talking.
- You shouldn't be here.

07:34.845 --> 07:35.933
- You keep-- you keep
poking the bear

07:35.977 --> 07:37.282
when I poke you right back.

07:37.326 --> 07:38.153
- Yeah, 'cause she's talking
when I'm talking.

07:38.196 --> 07:39.676
That's--
- Keep poking me.

07:39.720 --> 07:40.329
That's what's gonna happen.
What's your ----ing issue?

07:40.372 --> 07:41.722
What's your issue?

07:41.765 --> 07:43.811
I don't give a [BLEEP]!

07:43.854 --> 07:45.160
- As soon as Storm
starts yelling,

07:45.203 --> 07:46.901
the disaster button
is blinking.

07:46.944 --> 07:49.251
Beep, beep, beep,
beep, disaster.

07:49.294 --> 07:52.254
When she was 18, 19 years old,
she worked for me at my club.

07:52.297 --> 07:54.691
She was fired multiple times--
insubordination,

07:54.735 --> 07:56.214
talking crazy to folks,

07:56.258 --> 07:58.521
and this is not
just an issue with me.

07:58.565 --> 08:00.654
She's out of control.
She needs to be stopped.

08:00.697 --> 08:02.133
All right.
I'm out. I'm out.

08:02.177 --> 08:03.308
- You can't be talking
while she was talking, Dennis.

08:03.352 --> 08:04.527
- Yo, I ain't got
time for this sh--.

08:04.571 --> 08:05.659
I'll go home.
I ain't got time for this.

08:05.702 --> 08:07.138
I came because you asked me to.
- Bye!

08:07.182 --> 08:08.923
- Shut the up.
- Don't.

08:08.966 --> 08:12.230
- Oh, Dennis!
- Oh!

08:12.274 --> 08:13.318
- I ain't got time
for this kid.

08:13.362 --> 08:14.494
All she do, is talk.

08:14.537 --> 08:15.451
- And so, don't talk
to her like that.

08:15.495 --> 08:16.234
Exactly.
- I'm-- I'm going home!

08:16.278 --> 08:17.758
I ain't gotta be here, bro!

08:17.801 --> 08:19.542
- Yo, what are you doing?

08:19.586 --> 08:20.978
- And that's your grand exit.

08:21.022 --> 08:24.286
That's-- that's
his grand exit.

08:24.329 --> 08:26.636
- You all did--
- Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!

08:26.680 --> 08:27.942
- But that-- but ta---
no, no, no.

08:27.985 --> 08:31.598
Let me just make a point.
- No, no, no, no!

08:31.641 --> 08:33.730
I don't got time for this!
Go!

08:33.774 --> 08:35.123
- I'm pissed.

08:35.166 --> 08:36.733
It's not appropriate
to talk to family like that,

08:36.777 --> 08:39.562
and I feel like he wouldn't want
anybody to do that to Pilar.

08:39.606 --> 08:42.304
He's got to choose his words
and project his anger

08:42.347 --> 08:44.219
where it's supposed to be.

08:44.262 --> 08:47.352
- It's okay.
We still have a few days.

08:47.396 --> 08:49.746
The burden is not on you.

08:49.790 --> 08:51.182
You have to understand that.

08:51.226 --> 08:53.271
- What we feel is that
you should have told her,

08:53.315 --> 08:54.708
"Let him speak.
Be quiet.

08:54.751 --> 08:56.013
You had your turn."

08:56.057 --> 08:57.362
- Okay, but in some situations,
we have to be--

08:57.406 --> 08:58.712
be the bigger person.

08:58.755 --> 09:00.191
- I got the stick.
- We're trying to fix unity.

09:00.235 --> 09:01.628
- Yeah, I'm trying to tell y'all
what's y'all problem.

09:01.671 --> 09:02.716
- You're not-- don't--
but it's not you to fix her.

09:02.759 --> 09:03.630
It's not for to you fix her.
- Yeah.

09:03.673 --> 09:04.282
She's not Porsha.
She wanna be Porsha.

09:04.326 --> 09:05.196
She ain't Porsha.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.284
- So, you're leaving.

09:06.328 --> 09:08.112
- Hell yeah.

09:08.156 --> 09:09.331
- I don't got time
for this sh--.

09:09.374 --> 09:11.638
I am done for today.

09:11.681 --> 09:13.640
- I don't think Storm
has a healthy respect

09:13.683 --> 09:15.685
for her elders.

09:15.729 --> 09:18.688
I think Storm thinks Porsha
is her elder,

09:18.732 --> 09:21.691
and she has a healthy respect
for Porsha.

09:21.735 --> 09:26.261
- Yeah, let me go get Storm.

09:26.304 --> 09:27.654
Are you okay?

09:27.697 --> 09:29.612
- I don't understand
why he keeps coming for me.

09:29.656 --> 09:31.745
Like, I'm not even the reason
for him being here.

09:31.788 --> 09:34.356
He should be focused on
your relationship with Simon.

09:34.399 --> 09:35.966
He should be focused on Pilar.

09:36.010 --> 09:37.707
- Well, that's my point.

09:37.751 --> 09:39.883
To me, if--
if the only thing you can do,

09:39.927 --> 09:42.190
is project, project, project,
you're sitting up here

09:42.233 --> 09:44.192
trying to throw everything
on everybody else,

09:44.235 --> 09:46.368
I am not here
to abuse the family

09:46.411 --> 09:47.978
through what I want to happen.

09:48.022 --> 09:51.721
Get with it in a positive,
productive way.

09:51.765 --> 09:53.331
Then maybe that is the best,

09:53.375 --> 09:55.856
and I will deal with them
separately.

09:55.899 --> 09:56.900
- I mean,
I can go sit back down.

09:56.944 --> 09:58.032
I just needed a sec--

09:58.075 --> 09:58.815
I just needed to walk
for a second.

09:58.859 --> 09:59.990
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

10:00.034 --> 10:01.078
- Did you get some
fresh air, you know?

10:01.122 --> 10:03.298
- Gotta get some fresh air.
- Exactly.

10:03.341 --> 10:04.386
- You gon' call
our family broken...

10:04.429 --> 10:05.996
You don't even
know our family.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.737
- Why is Dennis is trying to
get all the attention

10:07.781 --> 10:09.086
from the trip?
Like, for real,

10:09.130 --> 10:11.654
like, dude,
you're creating all this drama

10:11.698 --> 10:14.744
when we should be focused on
coparenting for our daughter.

10:14.788 --> 10:17.747
He's just creating issues.
That's all.

10:17.791 --> 10:19.401
And if it's broken,
if you a man,

10:19.444 --> 10:21.838
you would be trying to fix it.

10:21.882 --> 10:23.013
Coming up...

10:23.057 --> 10:24.928
- I believe in
military strategies.

10:24.972 --> 10:25.929
- And what's that?

10:25.973 --> 10:27.409
- You have to tell Mama Gina,

10:27.452 --> 10:31.108
"You need to stay the
out of our business."

10:35.286 --> 10:37.767
- So, do you
like this room?

10:37.811 --> 10:40.335
Is this a good room for you?

10:40.378 --> 10:41.771
'Cause you should say bye.
- It is a cute room.

10:41.815 --> 10:42.903
- You have to say bye.

10:42.946 --> 10:44.208
- What do you mean
I should say bye?

10:44.252 --> 10:45.732
- Dennis is taking this room.

10:45.775 --> 10:47.647
- Why is he moving?
We gave him his own space.

10:47.690 --> 10:48.952
He has his own door.

10:48.996 --> 10:52.347
I'm in a three bedroom suite,
and in my suite

10:52.390 --> 11:00.268
we're gonna have Londie
and Dennis.

11:00.311 --> 11:03.271
- And, Lauren, you get to move
to the big suite.

11:03.314 --> 11:06.622
We have a infinity pool.
- I have an infinity pool.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.711
- Dennis needs this.
- Start packing, love.

11:08.755 --> 11:10.800
This is a horrible idea.
- Y'all.

11:10.844 --> 11:13.150
- I don't understand
how he thinks he can

11:13.194 --> 11:15.283
change the room assignments
when I made 'em anyway. Like--

11:15.326 --> 11:16.371
- That's what I'm saying.

11:16.414 --> 11:18.634
- Because tonight
was a sh-- show.

11:18.678 --> 11:21.289
- Yeah, it was but--
- Okay, well, because of him.

11:21.332 --> 11:23.247
- It wasn't because
of him, though.

11:23.291 --> 11:26.250
- Um, he really came at Storm.

11:26.294 --> 11:28.688
- Storm was being a bitch.

11:28.731 --> 11:30.385
Storm needed to
shut the up.

11:30.428 --> 11:31.865
- No grown man--
- Dennis, no.

11:31.908 --> 11:33.388
- Should ever tell a young girl
to shut the up.

11:33.431 --> 11:35.259
- I completely agree, but...

11:35.303 --> 11:37.653
I should have Storm
to shut the up.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.481
- Oh!

11:39.524 --> 11:43.311
- I remember Storm when she was
literally in my middle school,

11:43.354 --> 11:46.488
and, like,
we've always bumped heads

11:46.531 --> 11:47.750
every few years,

11:47.794 --> 11:49.839
and she just
never says hello.

11:49.883 --> 11:52.842
You don't say hey to people?

11:52.886 --> 11:54.975
- You weren't.
It's okay.

11:55.018 --> 11:56.367
So, it's just
the rudest thing to me

11:56.411 --> 11:58.195
that she never says hello.

11:58.239 --> 11:59.631
Her whole attitude
annoys me.

11:59.675 --> 12:01.068
- You gotta be at meditation.

12:01.111 --> 12:02.852
- I'm sleeping.
We have to be up at,
like, 7 a.m.

12:02.896 --> 12:04.158
- 7:30.

12:04.201 --> 12:06.247
- Can we keep arguing,
so we can get 8 or 9?

12:06.290 --> 12:07.683
- Don't be, uh, pointin'
your little finger.

12:07.727 --> 12:08.989
- Oh, you're in-in.

12:09.032 --> 12:10.207
- You can't even control
your own session, fam.

12:10.251 --> 12:11.469
You can't even control
your own session.

12:11.513 --> 12:12.688
- I can't control
my own session?
- Yeah.

12:12.732 --> 12:13.776
- No, I can't control
my brother-in-law.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.430
- Ooh, not brother-in-law.

12:15.473 --> 12:17.954
- I'm unhappy with everyone.

12:17.998 --> 12:20.652
Six a.m. meditation.
- I ain't making that.

12:20.696 --> 12:22.263
- Come on, Lauren.

12:22.306 --> 12:23.743
- See ya, Lauren.
- Goodbye.

12:23.786 --> 12:26.441
- I'm staying in--
in Mexico because of Pilar.

12:26.484 --> 12:29.879
I just didn't wanna be the guy
that ruined the trip.

12:29.923 --> 12:34.014
- See you at 6 with positivity
and love in your heart.

12:34.057 --> 12:36.320
- Oh, not the positivity
and love.

12:36.364 --> 12:37.757
- Yes.
- That's not in his heart.

12:45.547 --> 12:48.855
- My God.
- Oh, Lord.

12:48.898 --> 12:51.858
- Our home sweet home.
- Whew.

12:51.901 --> 12:53.903
What?
- Oh, my gosh.

12:53.947 --> 12:55.731
- Hey, you know what
I'm about to embark on?

12:55.775 --> 12:57.472
- Huh?

12:57.515 --> 12:59.387
- I'm gonna pull one
of these babies out.

12:59.430 --> 13:01.737
- You about to smoke it now?
What time is it? Isn't it--

13:01.781 --> 13:04.348
- Babe, who cares?

13:04.392 --> 13:06.873
We're on
a spiritual journey,

13:06.916 --> 13:08.483
and smoking a cigar
is one of 'em.

13:08.526 --> 13:12.574
- I didn't expect any of that
tonight at that dinner.

13:12.617 --> 13:14.489
- I expected it.
- You did?

13:14.532 --> 13:16.708
- Yes, I did.
- So, why didn't you warn me?

13:16.752 --> 13:19.755
- Because that's not my place.
- It is your place.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.802
- This was your planning.

13:22.845 --> 13:25.543
It was important for you
to allow people

13:25.587 --> 13:27.589
to show their
authentic self.

13:27.632 --> 13:29.330
- My thing is,

13:29.373 --> 13:34.596
is now I don't know
where it's supposed to go.

13:34.639 --> 13:41.821
- My initial instinct
was to talk to Dennis.

13:41.864 --> 13:43.257
- Why do you think that was?

13:43.300 --> 13:46.390
- It's in line with what
you're trying to accomplish.

13:46.434 --> 13:48.784
I want him to stay,
bottom line, but--

13:48.828 --> 13:50.351
- Why do you want him
to stay?

13:50.394 --> 13:52.832
- 'Cause I-- I want
an effective coparenting.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.921
I don't know of any others,
not in my family.

13:54.964 --> 13:56.792
- Mm-hmm.
- That they've been able

13:56.836 --> 14:00.622
to transition and where
we don't only coparent,

14:00.665 --> 14:03.712
but we're all
one big blended family,

14:03.755 --> 14:06.584
especially in the Black community.

14:06.628 --> 14:07.847
I mean,
I'll text and ask him

14:07.890 --> 14:10.806
if he will meet me
for breakfast.

14:10.850 --> 14:15.724
- Maybe something small,
a small gesture, very small.

14:15.767 --> 14:17.334
I feel it's very important
for Simon

14:17.378 --> 14:18.988
to have a conversation
with Dennis.

14:19.032 --> 14:21.643
Number one, that's gonna be
Pilar's stepdad.

14:21.686 --> 14:23.036
This ain't no game.

14:23.079 --> 14:25.647
This ain't just no
bubble gum ring on my finger,

14:25.690 --> 14:26.909
or we're just gonna be
engaged forever.

14:26.953 --> 14:28.476
We are getting married,

14:28.519 --> 14:30.434
and I want him
to have a position

14:30.478 --> 14:33.481
as a coparent.

14:33.524 --> 14:36.440
- And, I do have one--
one request from you.

14:36.484 --> 14:39.617
- What is it?

14:39.661 --> 14:41.706
I'm tired,
and my thighs hurt.

14:41.750 --> 14:43.099
What?

14:43.143 --> 14:45.536
- You can pack up
Dennis' sh--

14:45.580 --> 14:49.062
and make sure that it gets
to Dennis safe and sound.

14:49.105 --> 14:55.851
- Okay.
- That's it.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.113
- I did break up
with his things.

14:57.157 --> 14:59.463
The robe was just
one little thing.

14:59.507 --> 15:01.030
He's been forever
asking for the robe,

15:01.074 --> 15:02.945
and I've been forever
not giving it to him.

15:02.989 --> 15:08.646
He don't deserve the robe.

15:08.690 --> 15:11.823
- It-- I confiscated the robe.
The robe is my robe.

15:11.867 --> 15:13.173
I wear the robe
sometimes in the house

15:13.216 --> 15:14.609
when I wanna be fabulous.

15:14.652 --> 15:18.178
It is my robe now.
It is.

15:18.221 --> 15:22.138
It's done. I will--
I will make that happen.

15:22.182 --> 15:25.881
- You have a better chance
at succeeding

15:25.925 --> 15:31.147
in this family dynamics
if you target just Dennis.

15:31.191 --> 15:33.845
- I know that.
I've said that,

15:33.889 --> 15:35.630
but it doesn't work
like that

15:35.673 --> 15:38.546
because he has such
a close relationship

15:38.589 --> 15:42.202
with his mom, as he--
as he should.

15:42.245 --> 15:46.815
I'm trying to care for
Mama Gina at the same time

15:46.858 --> 15:48.991
as target my coparent

15:49.035 --> 15:51.646
into this new transition
that I wanna do.

15:51.689 --> 15:53.691
- Sometimes I believe
in military strategies.

15:53.735 --> 15:55.128
- And what's that?

15:55.171 --> 15:58.958
- You have to tell either him
or Mama Gina and say,

15:59.001 --> 16:01.569
"Hey, I need you
to step the up,

16:01.612 --> 16:04.746
so I can have an effective
coparenting wit' your son.

16:04.789 --> 16:06.226
You need to stay the
out of our business."

16:09.969 --> 16:12.928
Something to think about.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.451
- Coming up...

16:14.495 --> 16:16.497
- Dennis said today,
a girl is coming.

16:16.540 --> 16:17.759
- I think we need
to warn Porsha.

16:17.802 --> 16:23.460
I think--
- Oh, no.

16:30.598 --> 16:36.299
- Let's get close.

16:50.009 --> 16:53.229
- Thank you for, um, accepting
to meet with me this morning.

16:53.273 --> 16:55.057
- Yeah.

16:55.101 --> 16:58.321
- I wanted to speak to you
and say, hey, being here

16:58.365 --> 17:01.759
was the right thing to do,
and I applaud you for it.

17:01.803 --> 17:05.154
- The reason why I'm here
is because of you and Porsha.

17:05.198 --> 17:07.156
We gotta raise PJ.

17:07.200 --> 17:08.549
It's also a time that
me, you, and Porsha

17:08.592 --> 17:10.246
has to spend together.
- Yeah.

17:10.290 --> 17:11.639
- We gotta get that tight.
- Yeah.

17:11.682 --> 17:14.163
- Before we throw
everybody else in the mix

17:14.207 --> 17:16.252
who opinion really
don't matter.

17:16.296 --> 17:17.993
- Yeah, shouldn't matter.
- Right.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.603
- It's nice to have
family around,

17:19.647 --> 17:21.257
but as, you know,
we noticed,

17:21.301 --> 17:24.434
your mom, she, at some point,
got up and walked out.

17:24.478 --> 17:26.697
- You know, she wants the--
the-- the best for me, man,

17:26.741 --> 17:29.439
but sometimes I tell her,
like, you know,

17:29.483 --> 17:31.441
some of these battles
ain't yours to fight.

17:31.485 --> 17:34.444
Me and Porsha business
is not your business.

17:34.488 --> 17:36.707
- Mama Gina just needs to
continuously be encouraged

17:36.751 --> 17:39.406
that, hey, you wanna make sure
your-- your daughter's mom

17:39.449 --> 17:41.495
is good, as well,
so she can, you know,

17:41.538 --> 17:43.627
she can always, you know,
be in the right headspace

17:43.671 --> 17:45.107
for your daughter
when you're not around.

17:45.151 --> 17:46.587
- For sure, 1,000%.

17:46.630 --> 17:50.286
- Mama Gina, what you need
to do, is sit on the side,

17:50.330 --> 17:52.114
and you should never
be invested

17:52.158 --> 17:54.638
in your grown-ass son
relationship.

17:54.682 --> 17:57.293
That's just gonna create
friction for everybody,

17:57.337 --> 17:58.512
including your own son

17:58.555 --> 17:59.817
'cause one day
your own son might say,

17:59.861 --> 18:02.124
"You know what, mom?
I love you,

18:02.168 --> 18:04.083
but I need to put some
distance between me and you

18:04.126 --> 18:06.041
because every time
you come around,

18:06.085 --> 18:08.130
you sh-- up."

18:08.174 --> 18:10.480
- I'm excited to get to know you
better as we build, man,

18:10.524 --> 18:12.221
and we'll just
keep our focus on--

18:12.265 --> 18:14.832
on what's important.
- Yeah, absolutely.

18:14.876 --> 18:16.225
- I need you
to do me a favor.

18:16.269 --> 18:20.664
I will take that robe
if you can get it for me.

18:20.708 --> 18:22.623
- If I run into it,
I'll make sure you get it back.

18:22.666 --> 18:25.234
- Okay, cool.

18:25.278 --> 18:26.496
- You don't have to worry
about that.

18:26.540 --> 18:28.063
- Yeah.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.325
- I'll tell you one thing
I did in my past relationships.

18:29.369 --> 18:30.631
I-- I'm pretty good
with packing them up.

18:31.849 --> 18:33.634
I have a professional
moving company

18:33.677 --> 18:36.071
that makes sure
every piece of fabric

18:36.115 --> 18:38.160
makes its way to where
it's supposed to be.

18:38.204 --> 18:40.249
- You know, this guy
is really calculative.

18:40.293 --> 18:41.903
Somebody told me he'd been
married five times,

18:41.946 --> 18:44.688
so I'm not surprised he's got
a moving company on speed dial.

18:44.732 --> 18:47.561
You know, Porsha need to be
prepared for that.

18:47.604 --> 18:50.259
At some point, you know,
I'll have a significant other,

18:50.303 --> 18:52.348
and then that's another
dynamic, right?

18:52.392 --> 18:54.220
Porsha says she didn't want me
to bring a date here, man,

18:54.263 --> 18:56.700
but I didn't wanna
sit around for four days

18:56.744 --> 18:59.181
twiddling my thumbs.

18:59.225 --> 19:00.226
So, if you could, man,

19:00.269 --> 19:01.314
let her know
I'm bringing a date,

19:01.357 --> 19:02.619
you know.
- Okay, sure.

19:02.663 --> 19:03.925
I'll tell her.
I'll talk to her.

19:03.968 --> 19:06.188
Hopefully, we can enjoy
the rest of this meal.

19:06.232 --> 19:08.190
- Trip, too.

19:16.242 --> 19:18.418
- I made notes
for this meditation.

19:18.461 --> 19:22.596
- You got this.
- It's a new day.

19:22.639 --> 19:25.164
Good morning.
Hey, Aunt Liz.

19:25.207 --> 19:28.515
You can have a seat
wherever you'd like.

19:28.558 --> 19:30.212
- Lena, how you doin'?
- How are you, Dennis?

19:30.256 --> 19:31.213
- Great.

19:31.257 --> 19:32.388
- Where were you?
In the pool?

19:32.432 --> 19:33.650
- Oh, I just had
breakfast with Simon.

19:33.694 --> 19:35.217
- Cute. Aww.

19:35.261 --> 19:36.653
- Liz, how you doin'?
- Hey, good.

19:36.697 --> 19:41.919
- Good, good.

19:41.963 --> 19:43.704
- I'm glad to
hear you say that.

19:43.747 --> 19:44.879
- Hello.
How are y'all?

19:44.922 --> 19:46.315
- Hey.
- Hello.

19:46.359 --> 19:47.360
- Yes.
- Do we have anyone else?

19:47.403 --> 19:48.752
- Where's Porsha?

19:48.796 --> 19:50.928
- I think this is all we have.
- Okay.

19:50.972 --> 19:52.713
- Honestly, the fact
that Porsha is not here,

19:52.756 --> 19:55.455
my feelings are hurt
more than I'm mad,

19:55.498 --> 19:56.978
and it's her blended family.

19:57.021 --> 19:59.459
No one else cares that much
if this family is blended.

19:59.502 --> 20:02.157
She's the one that wanted it,
and she's not even here.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.246
So, sit in the most
comfortable position

20:04.290 --> 20:06.161
that you can possibly
get in.

20:09.556 --> 20:12.863
So, now I want you to
visualize someone

20:12.907 --> 20:16.432
that has triggered you,

20:16.476 --> 20:18.434
someone who rubs you
the wrong way.

20:18.478 --> 20:20.262
- You started this.
- I didn't start sh--.

20:20.306 --> 20:23.961
- Yes, you did
by going behind people's back.

20:24.005 --> 20:25.441
- I know Porsha
still love me.

20:25.485 --> 20:28.227
Humans, we just
are emotional creatures.

20:28.270 --> 20:29.750
Love is a part of who we are,

20:29.793 --> 20:33.710
but sometimes it's just hard
to get past certain stuff.

20:33.754 --> 20:36.452
- I want you
to visualize them.

20:36.496 --> 20:38.585
- Storm, you don't know
what's going on.

20:38.628 --> 20:41.501
Stay out of it.
- What are you gonna do?

20:41.544 --> 20:43.807
- And become aware
of how your body feels

20:43.851 --> 20:46.810
when they come into
your mind.

20:46.854 --> 20:48.725
Do you feel tightness
in your stomach?

20:48.769 --> 20:52.294
Accept the fact
that they have a hold on you.

20:52.338 --> 20:53.948
- I-- I don't know why
I'm here anymore.

20:53.991 --> 20:55.210
- Mmm.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.952
- And I don't know
these people.

20:57.995 --> 21:02.522
- Breathe in compassion
and breathe out the toxicity

21:02.565 --> 21:06.308
that is flowing through
our family right now.

21:06.352 --> 21:07.440
Stop talking about it.

21:07.483 --> 21:08.832
If anyone says,
"Robe," again, go home!

21:08.876 --> 21:09.964
- I ain't playing,
not one damn--

21:10.007 --> 21:12.575
- Let me finish!

21:12.619 --> 21:20.583
You can feel this uncomfortable
feeling and breathe.

21:20.627 --> 21:23.020
Now, I invite you
to gently open your eyes.

21:23.064 --> 21:28.504
Be patient with yourselves
and with other people.

21:28.548 --> 21:30.637
I love you guys.
- I need a favor.

21:30.680 --> 21:32.334
You gotta bring Gina
to the next one.

21:32.378 --> 21:33.901
She was so emotionally
attached to this family.

21:33.944 --> 21:35.511
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

21:35.555 --> 21:37.905
- You know, and, uh,
she's having a harder time

21:37.948 --> 21:39.863
than anybody
'cause it happened so fast.

21:39.907 --> 21:41.474
- Yeah.
- Yes.

21:41.517 --> 21:42.779
- This was good today.
- Mm-hmm.

21:42.823 --> 21:43.867
- Of course, I would love
to have her here.

21:43.911 --> 21:44.999
- Love you guys.

21:45.042 --> 21:47.567
- Yes.
- Aww.

21:47.610 --> 21:48.742
- Thank you, Dennis.
- That's amazing.

21:48.785 --> 21:50.483
- Thank you.

21:50.526 --> 21:51.701
- Thank you guys for coming.

21:51.745 --> 21:53.442
- Yay.

21:53.486 --> 21:54.922
- Now, we can get out
of this hot sun.

21:54.965 --> 21:56.489
We're going to
the cenote today.

21:56.532 --> 21:57.533
Let's go put
our bathing suits on.

21:57.577 --> 21:58.534
- Let's do it.

21:58.578 --> 22:00.275
- Okay.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.842
- You're a natural.
- Thank you.

22:01.885 --> 22:05.976
- You're such-- you really
are such an amazing teacher.

22:09.415 --> 22:11.373
- Okay, now, Headkrack,
now you know I need this.

22:11.417 --> 22:15.377
How much is it?

22:18.728 --> 22:21.383
- You refreshed?
- I'm refreshed.

22:21.427 --> 22:24.299
- So, remember last night
when Dennis did the whole

22:24.343 --> 22:26.432
I'm ready to trade rooms,
blah, blah, blah?

22:26.475 --> 22:27.737
- Right.

22:27.781 --> 22:29.957
- And then he said today,
a girl was coming.

22:32.786 --> 22:34.788
- We are full today
with this,

22:34.831 --> 22:35.571
with your
- Okay. Let me go.

22:35.615 --> 22:39.401
I gotta go see.

22:39.445 --> 22:40.707
- I understand.

22:40.750 --> 22:43.753
I'm-I'm-- I'm wondering
what's going on, too.

22:43.797 --> 22:47.366
- What is a girl gonna
do but create more drama?

22:47.409 --> 22:49.933
- Like, keep it in your pants
for four days.

22:49.977 --> 22:51.718
- I think we need
to warn Porsha.

22:51.761 --> 22:53.589
I think--
- Oh, no.

22:53.633 --> 22:56.984
When Porsha finds out
that Dennis brought a date,

22:57.027 --> 23:00.422
Porsha is going to start
sharpening her knives.

23:00.466 --> 23:01.815
- I think we need
to tell her.

23:01.858 --> 23:02.946
- If he brings that girl
around, though,

23:02.990 --> 23:04.121
it's gonna be
like last night.

23:04.165 --> 23:08.909
It's not gonna
be productive.

23:08.952 --> 23:10.563
- Coming up next...

23:11.868 --> 23:15.916
- Let it out. That's it.
- Jesus, thank you!

23:26.883 --> 23:29.886
- I'm so excited!
I've never been to a cenote.

23:29.930 --> 23:32.106
- Cenote, it's so pretty.

23:32.149 --> 23:33.586
- I'm so excited.

23:33.629 --> 23:35.892
- It's gonna be beautiful.

23:35.936 --> 23:38.112
- Yeah, where is Porsha?

23:38.155 --> 23:40.941
Porsha has literally been
getting for, like, five hours.

23:46.599 --> 23:49.863
- Lauren told me I couldn't
bring my girl to the cenote.

23:49.906 --> 23:56.522
- Y'all in a relationship?

23:56.565 --> 23:58.001
- Then knock that bird
out over there

23:58.045 --> 23:59.873
and knock this bird out
over here with us.

23:59.916 --> 24:02.179
- After all, Porsha
probably would've threw her

24:02.223 --> 24:04.878
in the cenote river,
but, uh, she can swim.

24:04.921 --> 24:08.229
I'm pretty sure.

24:08.272 --> 24:10.840
- Hi!
Hi!

24:10.884 --> 24:14.061
- Oh, jeez.
- Hey, cutie, look at you.

24:14.104 --> 24:15.584
- Sit right here,
babe, across from me.

24:15.628 --> 24:17.543
- What's going on?
- How y'all doin'?

24:17.586 --> 24:19.501
- Good.

24:19.545 --> 24:25.072
- Everybody looks so colorful.

24:25.115 --> 24:26.290
- The who?
- Is it called a C-note?

24:26.334 --> 24:27.901
- What's that?
- It's not a C-note, baby.

24:27.944 --> 24:29.946
- The C-what?
- It's not a C-note.

24:29.990 --> 24:33.167
Lena, what is it called?

24:33.210 --> 24:34.647
- Porsha, why you
never correct me?

24:34.690 --> 24:35.909
- I thought you was
talking about some money

24:35.952 --> 24:38.520
or some drugs.

24:38.564 --> 24:41.218
You know, that sound
like some street sh--.

24:41.262 --> 24:42.524
I don't even know
what a cenote is.

24:42.568 --> 24:44.265
- Me neither.
- It's a sinkhole.

24:44.308 --> 24:46.310
- A who?
- A sinkhole.

24:46.354 --> 24:47.573
- I don't wanna go.

24:47.616 --> 24:49.183
Why would you put us
in a sinkhole, Lauren?

24:49.226 --> 24:50.401
- You'll see.

24:50.445 --> 24:51.620
- Now, why would
you do that?

24:51.664 --> 24:54.188
- Last night's dinner
was ridiculous,

24:54.231 --> 24:56.886
so I'm hoping that they come
to this understanding

24:56.930 --> 24:58.279
that they need
to follow some rules,

24:58.322 --> 25:01.238
and they need to
shut the F up for a second

25:01.282 --> 25:03.414
so that we can get
through some things.

25:03.458 --> 25:06.940
- Simon, when do we get to
meet the women in your family?

25:06.983 --> 25:09.551
- Why you haven't
put us together yet?

25:09.595 --> 25:11.640
- Because we have
so much else going on.

25:11.684 --> 25:13.512
- 'Cause I'm too busy
putting you in my family.

25:21.215 --> 25:23.086
- All right, listen up.
I just wanna explain to you.

25:23.130 --> 25:25.915
We are here to do
a cleansing ritual,

25:25.959 --> 25:29.310
so I want us to be very vocal
about what it is we feel

25:29.353 --> 25:30.920
that we need
to get rid of.

25:30.964 --> 25:32.705
So, we have a guide
here to help us.

25:32.748 --> 25:37.623
Eric, hey. Hola.
- Hola.

25:37.666 --> 25:40.103
My home is now your home,
guys, okay? Welcome.

25:40.147 --> 25:42.062
- Thank you.
- So, let me explain you.

25:42.105 --> 25:44.934
The first cenote right here,
65 meters inside

25:44.978 --> 25:48.372
to the cave
right there, guys.

25:48.416 --> 25:51.245
It's, like, uh, 42,

25:51.288 --> 25:52.376
42 feet deep.
- Forty-two feet?

25:52.420 --> 25:55.075
- Forty-two.
- Yeah, it's super deep.

25:55.118 --> 26:07.957
- Tell us more
about these waters.

26:08.001 --> 26:11.091
- And-and these are Mayan lands.
- Exactly.

26:11.134 --> 26:14.094
- Oh, wow.

26:14.137 --> 26:15.617
- You can find arms.
- What'd he say?

26:15.661 --> 26:18.751
- Body parts all over
the place.

26:21.144 --> 26:23.146
- So, you guys ready?
Let's go swimming, huh?

26:23.190 --> 26:27.324
- Thank you.

26:27.368 --> 26:29.326
- Wow! Look at that.

26:29.370 --> 26:32.155
- Yeah, I'm not drinking that.
- It's the fishes in there.

26:32.199 --> 26:35.637
- Oh, y'all,
it's so pretty.

26:35.681 --> 26:37.508
- Before we get
into the water,

26:37.552 --> 26:45.212
we're gonna do
a short meditation.

26:45.255 --> 26:48.563
- So, when you feel comfortable,
allow your eyes to close.

26:48.607 --> 26:51.740
What is it you're ready to
let go of in this moment?

26:51.784 --> 26:53.612
We'll use this as
the talking stick.

26:53.655 --> 26:55.483
- So, we're gonna try
the stick again

26:55.526 --> 26:57.267
'cause we tried it
at the table,

26:57.311 --> 26:59.313
and it failed.
So, we'll try again,

26:59.356 --> 27:01.663
and pray a lot.

27:01.707 --> 27:04.710
- After each person goes,
we're gonna clap and say,

27:04.753 --> 27:08.322
"Aho and so it is," okay?
- Okay.

27:08.365 --> 27:11.717
Aho and so it is.

27:11.760 --> 27:13.196
- Um...

27:13.240 --> 27:17.374
I guess I wanna release
any anger toward anybody

27:17.418 --> 27:21.465
and to just work
on patience

27:21.509 --> 27:24.599
for, um...

27:24.643 --> 27:28.037
people who--
for people in general.

27:28.081 --> 27:32.346
Aho and so it is.

27:32.389 --> 27:33.652
- Thank you.

27:37.699 --> 27:42.443
- Okay,
I wanna apologize,

27:42.486 --> 27:44.837
and if you wanna
call it, let go,

27:44.880 --> 27:52.235
of the years that...

27:52.279 --> 27:57.414
I wasn't present
for my daughter,

27:57.458 --> 28:01.592
because I was just
busy with business.

28:01.636 --> 28:05.596
- Mm-hmm.
- And I apologize for that.

28:05.640 --> 28:07.207
So, just give me
a second chance

28:07.250 --> 28:09.339
to be the best mom
that I can be

28:09.383 --> 28:11.385
'cause all I want
for you is the best.

28:11.428 --> 28:12.734
And-and then
the other thing, I--

28:12.778 --> 28:13.779
I know I'm taking
a long time,

28:13.822 --> 28:17.739
but the other thing is--
- It's okay.

28:17.783 --> 28:20.394
- Storm is the type of person
if you try to give her

28:20.437 --> 28:21.743
some love and affection,

28:21.787 --> 28:24.137
and she doesn't really
receive it that well,

28:24.180 --> 28:26.226
we'll do our little hug,
and then we're done.

28:26.269 --> 28:27.749
- I'll give you a hug
before we leave, not-not now.

28:27.793 --> 28:29.055
- Can y'all
do it right now?

28:29.098 --> 28:30.665
- I mean, I'm not really
a hugger, but, I mean,

28:30.709 --> 28:32.101
I-I can give a hug.
- Just for your mama.

28:32.145 --> 28:33.233
- It's your mother.
- Well, I'm not a hugger either.

28:33.276 --> 28:34.364
- Practice.
- Heart to heart.

28:34.408 --> 28:36.105
- Embrace.
- Can we have a real hug?

28:36.149 --> 28:38.629
I mean, all I ever get
is just a little pat-pat.

28:38.673 --> 28:40.762
I want a--
I want a real hug.

28:45.636 --> 28:47.290
- Let it out. That's it.

28:47.334 --> 28:50.816
- Jesus! Jesus!

28:50.859 --> 28:54.210
Jesus, thank you!

28:54.254 --> 28:55.734
Thank you!

28:58.388 --> 29:07.354
Jesus, thank you.
Thank you, Jesus!

29:09.835 --> 29:14.013
- Thank you.
Thank you, Jesus!

29:14.056 --> 29:16.232
Oh, thank you, Jesus.
Thank you.

29:16.276 --> 29:21.672
- Mmm-mmm-mmm.
- Thank you.

29:21.716 --> 29:23.065
- Okay.
- Thank you, baby.

29:23.109 --> 29:25.764
- Yes, yes.
That was a breakthrough.

29:25.807 --> 29:29.289
- Amazing work.

29:29.332 --> 29:30.333
- Yes.

29:30.377 --> 29:34.207
I wanna release
all those ghosts

29:34.250 --> 29:36.818
of the Civil Rights Movement.
- Yes.

29:36.862 --> 29:40.213
- All the lynchings,
and the shadows,

29:40.256 --> 29:43.390
the beatings,

29:43.433 --> 29:45.087
all the things
that I dream about

29:45.131 --> 29:50.701
that was done to my people
that haunt me.

29:50.745 --> 29:54.270
I let those ghosts go,

29:54.314 --> 29:58.057
so I can find out
who is Elizabeth.

29:58.100 --> 30:00.799
When you're raised in
the Civil Rights Movement,

30:00.842 --> 30:05.412
you see images in
your dreams all the time.

30:05.455 --> 30:07.109
My father,
Hosea Williams,

30:07.153 --> 30:10.199
was on the executive staff
of Martin Luther King,

30:10.243 --> 30:13.289
and I grew up thinking
that all nine-year-olds

30:13.333 --> 30:17.380
went to jail for marching,
so I never knew anything else

30:17.424 --> 30:19.992
but fighting,
and marching,

30:20.035 --> 30:21.254
picketing.

30:21.297 --> 30:24.300
That was my whole life.

30:24.344 --> 30:27.869
- I want to get rid of

30:27.913 --> 30:30.176
the negative part of me

30:30.219 --> 30:33.222
that does not allow me
to be forgiving.

30:33.266 --> 30:35.834
If there is also anyone

30:35.877 --> 30:37.966
I may have made
you uncomfortable,

30:38.010 --> 30:41.883
I ask that you forgive me,

30:41.927 --> 30:45.800
as-as I struggle
with unforgiveness.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.846
- Good job.

30:47.889 --> 30:55.941
Aho and so it is.

30:55.984 --> 30:58.334
- Gonna come back on around.

30:58.378 --> 31:00.336
- Uh...

31:00.380 --> 31:02.948
I know I'm not the host,
but I gotta say this, man.

31:02.991 --> 31:05.211
I'm really, like,
proud of everybody,

31:05.254 --> 31:10.042
especially Mama Gina.
Like, I'm-I'm proud of you.

31:10.085 --> 31:14.481
I am letting go today of things
that are not important.

31:14.524 --> 31:18.006
I go to the pool.
PJ was like, "Oh, daddy!"

31:18.050 --> 31:21.183
And I was like, man,
that's important.

31:21.227 --> 31:23.055
Today, I am making it
very intentional

31:23.098 --> 31:26.362
just to be more about
putting me first,

31:26.406 --> 31:32.151
my daughter.
That's it.

31:32.194 --> 31:35.415
Aho and so it is.

31:35.458 --> 31:36.372
- Okay.

31:36.416 --> 31:40.159
Um, I have a whole lot
to say.

31:40.202 --> 31:43.510
I haven't had much animosity
with anybody in the group

31:43.553 --> 31:47.296
besides, um, Ma-Mama Gina
had a uncomfortable luncheon.

31:47.340 --> 31:50.865
When someone mentions that
Dennis was a cheater,

31:50.909 --> 31:54.042
you get upset.
- Okay, but you were
a cheater, too.

31:54.086 --> 31:56.827
- I feel like she and I have
to have more conversation

31:56.871 --> 31:58.351
about it to get to
a place of forgiveness

31:58.394 --> 32:01.789
'cause I'm not there,
but I'm not ready for that.

32:01.832 --> 32:04.444
I definitely feel like this
process has brought back

32:04.487 --> 32:06.968
some of the emotional
issues that I had

32:07.012 --> 32:08.056
when I was with Dennis

32:08.100 --> 32:10.102
because after
Dennis and I broke up,

32:10.145 --> 32:11.930
I was upset with Dennis,

32:11.973 --> 32:15.324
and I felt like she should've
been upset with him, too.

32:15.368 --> 32:18.240
That's what truly,
I think, severed

32:18.284 --> 32:21.504
a genuine deep
relationship with her.

32:21.548 --> 32:24.899
- I don't feel that
Porsha is being receptive

32:24.943 --> 32:26.205
to anything
I've ever said,

32:26.248 --> 32:28.076
but it's okay,

32:28.120 --> 32:30.557
because forgiveness
is for me.

32:30.600 --> 32:33.255
Therefore, I feel
fine about it.

32:33.299 --> 32:35.170
- So, Lauren,
you take the stick

32:35.214 --> 32:36.955
because you're a part
of this family.

32:36.998 --> 32:38.086
- Yeah.

32:38.130 --> 32:40.262
- I noticed that
as Porsha was speaking,

32:40.306 --> 32:43.439
your toes literally
curled under your feet,

32:43.483 --> 32:46.877
and I want this
to be healing for you, too.

32:46.921 --> 32:49.968
- I feel like
I need to forgive you

32:50.011 --> 32:53.449
for our working relationship.

32:53.493 --> 32:56.278
In my opinion,
I was never fully appreciated.

32:56.322 --> 32:59.107
I still probably hold that
against you a little bit.

32:59.151 --> 33:02.154
- Okay.

33:02.197 --> 33:04.939
- I ultimately quit
working for Porsha

33:04.983 --> 33:07.463
because I was undervalued.

33:07.507 --> 33:08.638
So, for me
to say it today,

33:08.682 --> 33:11.250
I think she probably
feels attacked,

33:11.293 --> 33:13.295
but I wanna do
what's best for me.

33:13.339 --> 33:14.993
I won't work for you anymore.
- We-- we will.

33:15.036 --> 33:16.124
- I will literally just
work for their company.

33:16.168 --> 33:17.647
- We will. We will.

33:17.691 --> 33:19.301
- I'll be on the street
with my daughter.

33:19.345 --> 33:21.869
- She was ultimately
unhappy with

33:21.912 --> 33:23.479
where she was
in her life period.

33:23.523 --> 33:25.046
- I'm not happy.

33:25.090 --> 33:27.440
I'm tired of
working for you.

33:27.483 --> 33:30.138
- And so, making me
the big bad wolf

33:30.182 --> 33:32.053
and being able
to knock me down

33:32.097 --> 33:33.533
somehow empowered her.

33:33.576 --> 33:35.665
- I think it's time
to use the water

33:35.709 --> 33:39.234
to release
what we are letting go.

33:39.278 --> 33:41.497
We're going to have them
visualize

33:41.541 --> 33:44.065
the water cleansing
themselves

33:44.109 --> 33:47.373
to clear out some negativity
in everyone's life.

33:47.416 --> 33:48.504
- It's like
a little bath, huh?

33:48.548 --> 33:50.158
- It's like--
Not no bath.

33:52.073 --> 33:54.032
- So, come on in.
Come touch the water.

33:54.075 --> 33:55.250
- It's-- it's so cold.

33:55.294 --> 33:56.686
- But see if

33:59.733 --> 34:02.170
- Mo-- oh, sh--,
Porsha stop.

34:02.214 --> 34:04.912
- Get in the water.

34:04.955 --> 34:06.522
- Yeah!

34:07.088 --> 34:12.180
- Okay, Dom.

34:12.224 --> 34:14.182
- Can you swim?

34:23.757 --> 34:25.715
- Mexico.

34:25.759 --> 34:27.282
- It's beautiful.

34:27.326 --> 34:29.067
- Oh, it is beautiful.

34:29.110 --> 34:31.373
- Wow, this is fancy.

34:31.417 --> 34:34.985
- How are you?
- Hi.

34:35.029 --> 34:37.379
- I don't know where to sit.
- Anywhere you want to.

34:37.423 --> 34:39.077
- Hello, hello,
hello, hello.

34:39.120 --> 34:41.383
- Hi.
- Come on, body.

34:43.255 --> 34:44.734
- Hey.
- Hi.

34:44.778 --> 34:52.264
Wow, everybody
is so colorful.

34:52.307 --> 34:53.569
- Ooh.
- Uh-oh.

34:53.613 --> 34:55.571
- Oh, cha-cha-cha.

34:55.615 --> 34:58.008
That's how you
do it in Mexico.

35:03.231 --> 35:04.232
- Hello.
- Hi.

35:04.276 --> 35:05.103
You sittin' next
to me, Miss Gina?

35:05.146 --> 35:06.408
- I am.
- Yeah.

35:06.452 --> 35:08.062
- Right on time 'cause
I'm gonna kick her butt.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.542
- Ow.

35:14.242 --> 35:15.548
- Oh, Gina, honey.
- Mama Gina, where your son at?

35:15.591 --> 35:17.419
- He had other plans
tonight.

35:19.291 --> 35:21.597
- Yeah, I literally
just took a shower-- Okay.
- Hey...

35:21.641 --> 35:27.037
I literally just took
a shower last minute myself.

35:27.081 --> 35:28.517
I'm being summoned.

35:28.561 --> 35:32.042
- Oh, stop it.

35:32.086 --> 35:44.185
So, I hear...

35:44.229 --> 35:45.621
But it's a tough situation.
- I don't know what to say.

35:45.665 --> 35:48.233
That's just weird.

35:48.276 --> 35:49.756
- He didn't want to
come to dinner with us?

35:49.799 --> 35:51.801
- He had a guest
to come tonight.

35:51.845 --> 35:54.282
- A guest?
- Yes.

35:54.326 --> 35:56.154
Mm-hmm,
who was in Mexico,

35:56.197 --> 35:58.156
so he decided to spend
some time with his guest.

35:58.199 --> 36:01.115
- A female guest?
- Yes.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.638
- Is she coming to dinner?

36:11.995 --> 36:14.824
- He had a guest
to come tonight.

36:14.868 --> 36:18.828
- A female guest?
- Yes.

36:18.872 --> 36:20.526
- Is she coming to dinner?

36:20.569 --> 36:23.224
- Oh, no, it's her birthday,
so he took her out.

36:23.268 --> 36:25.618
- What?

36:25.661 --> 36:32.799
- Oh.

36:32.842 --> 36:34.279
- Okay.

36:34.322 --> 36:35.584
At this point, I'm just
dealing with the consequences

36:35.628 --> 36:37.847
of his toxic mother.

36:37.891 --> 36:40.023
He is now toxic.
- I don't think she's toxic.

36:40.067 --> 36:41.329
- She's very toxic.

36:41.373 --> 36:43.244
She told me to my face
that I cheated on Dennis

36:43.288 --> 36:44.724
and then she said
my mom said it,

36:44.767 --> 36:47.944
which is a ----ing lie.

36:47.988 --> 36:49.859
So-- and she couldn't
apologize for it

36:49.903 --> 36:51.209
in the ditch earlier,

36:51.252 --> 36:53.646
which is, like, this
is a truthful space,

36:53.689 --> 36:54.864
and you still can't--
- No, she said--

36:54.908 --> 36:57.171
- She said, "If I-- if I."
- That's weird.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.565
Porsha is putting the blame
on Mama Gina right now,

36:59.608 --> 37:00.957
but what she's
really upset about

37:01.001 --> 37:02.524
is Dennis bringing a date.

37:02.568 --> 37:05.179
She really needs to stop.
Simon doesn't need to see this.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.789
- It is what it is.
We're good.

37:06.833 --> 37:08.269
Come on.
Ain't no big drawn out sh--.

37:08.313 --> 37:09.836
Come on.
- Okay.

37:15.885 --> 37:18.192
- You okay?
- Yeah.

37:23.937 --> 37:26.983
- Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm.

37:27.027 --> 37:31.031
- Who is missing?
We're missing two seats.

37:31.074 --> 37:35.035
- Oh, because Dennis
brought a girl.

37:35.078 --> 37:36.210
- Are we waiting to see
if they're coming,

37:36.254 --> 37:37.342
so we can finish?
- I surely hope not.

37:37.385 --> 37:40.997
We're not waiting.
We got appetizers.

37:41.041 --> 37:48.048
Yeah.

37:48.091 --> 37:51.791
- I'm not that mature
right now, no.

37:51.834 --> 37:53.314
- I just wanna thank
Lena for being here.

37:53.358 --> 37:56.622
This is her last night
with us.

37:56.665 --> 38:00.713
You have provided us with
such spiritual guidance,

38:00.756 --> 38:04.717
and we appreciate
all of your support in that.

38:04.760 --> 38:07.981
- As far as Lena goes,
I am not coming against her,

38:08.024 --> 38:09.765
but what worries me
about the work

38:09.809 --> 38:12.072
that Lauren has been
doing with Lena,

38:12.115 --> 38:15.728
if Lena leads Lauren into

38:15.771 --> 38:19.819
taking the covers
off of old wounds

38:19.862 --> 38:23.649
and doesn't provide here with
a methodology for healing,

38:23.692 --> 38:24.867
then she's just
gonna leave her

38:24.911 --> 38:27.000
with a bunch of
opened up wounds,

38:27.043 --> 38:29.089
and it's gonna be
a nightmare.

38:29.132 --> 38:31.265
I just wanna cautious us
on mixing up

38:31.309 --> 38:33.311
a bunch of different things.

38:33.354 --> 38:35.051
You say you have
someone else coming.

38:35.095 --> 38:37.140
- Yes, I'm gonna bring
in a life coach.

38:37.184 --> 38:38.272
Her name is Elle.

38:38.316 --> 38:39.795
She's amazing.

38:39.839 --> 38:42.842
We wanna do a gratefulness
practice with you guys.

38:42.885 --> 38:44.409
Super simple, super fun.

38:44.452 --> 38:45.932
Positive, nothing heavy.

38:45.975 --> 38:47.194
- We can't take
nothing else heavy.

38:47.237 --> 38:49.065
- Nothing that can
make anyone cry.

38:49.109 --> 38:50.371
I mean--
- There's no guarantees
with that.

38:50.415 --> 38:51.764
- No guarantees.

38:51.807 --> 38:53.766
- Storm's eyes
don't even water.

38:53.809 --> 38:55.333
- I feel like I'm very
nonchalant when it comes

38:55.376 --> 38:56.769
to a lot of things, so...

38:56.812 --> 38:59.293
- You just don't let things
really bother you.

38:59.337 --> 39:00.947
- You gotta just deal.
- She needs to cry with us, cry.

39:00.990 --> 39:01.991
- You have to just
deal with that.

39:02.035 --> 39:03.297
- Doing the cry.

39:03.341 --> 39:04.298
- I'm internally crying.
You just can't see it.

39:04.342 --> 39:05.952
- Join the tears.

39:05.995 --> 39:09.042
- Ahh, I need a Coca-Cola
when you get a chance.

39:09.085 --> 39:11.392
- I mean, I know I didn't
openly share at the cenote,

39:11.436 --> 39:14.830
but I was in
a relationship with someone,

39:14.874 --> 39:17.746
and the entire time,
it was toxic.

39:17.790 --> 39:19.313
It was abusive.

39:19.357 --> 39:22.795
I just remember being utterly
scared around the person.

39:22.838 --> 39:24.666
I was isolated.

39:24.710 --> 39:26.189
You know, I feel like I was--
I used to tell her all the time

39:26.233 --> 39:27.408
I feel like I'm on island.

39:27.452 --> 39:28.801
- Can I have a--

39:28.844 --> 39:30.324
last night, you,
like, got up

39:30.368 --> 39:31.760
and asked what
I was gonna do.

39:31.804 --> 39:32.935
Stay out of it.

39:32.979 --> 39:34.459
- What are you gonna do?

39:34.502 --> 39:35.982
- Oh, no, you're
not standing up.

39:36.025 --> 39:38.071
Girl, bye.
-

39:38.114 --> 39:41.291
- So, I was just wondering,
like, where that aggression from

39:41.335 --> 39:42.945
in your small tone because--
- So, now you wanna use

39:42.989 --> 39:44.338
the trauma that
I've been through to say

39:44.382 --> 39:45.948
that I did something
to you yesterday.

39:45.992 --> 39:47.385
- No, no, no,
I'm not in any--

39:47.428 --> 39:48.864
- But you used my abuse
to get to this conversation.

39:48.908 --> 39:50.039
- No, that's not what I did.
- So, I no longer wanna

39:50.083 --> 39:51.432
have this conversation
with you.

39:51.476 --> 39:52.346
- No, that's not what I did.
- I'm gonna end it.

39:52.390 --> 39:53.956
- No, listen. Listen.
- No.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.175
- Wait a minute.
Let me just--

39:55.218 --> 39:56.350
let me-- let me just say--

39:56.394 --> 39:57.917
- Let me talk!

39:57.960 --> 39:59.440
I just want you
to apologize.

39:59.484 --> 40:01.007
- I'm not.

40:01.050 --> 40:02.182
- But you-- do you-you--
- No.

40:02.225 --> 40:03.749
- But you understand
why she may be

40:03.792 --> 40:05.054
receiving it that way.
- No.

40:05.098 --> 40:08.014
- I don't really
know Londie.

40:08.057 --> 40:09.842
I'm the type of person
I speak when spoken to.

40:09.885 --> 40:11.931
So, she never spoke to me.
I don't speak to her.

40:11.974 --> 40:15.413
To address everyone
at the-the table--

40:15.456 --> 40:17.980
- One time, when I thought
to myself, you know...

40:18.024 --> 40:20.722
- Right.
- It's good that you're still
here to tell your story,

40:20.766 --> 40:22.028
it didn't even dawn on me.

40:22.071 --> 40:23.029
I'll wait.
- Wait, what?

40:23.072 --> 40:24.334
Like, literally,
what's happening

40:24.378 --> 40:26.075
at the other ----ing
end of the table?

40:26.119 --> 40:27.163
- We're trying to
figure this out.

40:27.207 --> 40:28.338
- It's just me trying--
I'm trying--

40:28.382 --> 40:29.470
- We're just trying
to figure it out.

40:29.514 --> 40:30.906
- Figure it out
while she is talking.

40:30.950 --> 40:31.820
- No, we're trying--
we're trying to figure it out.

40:31.864 --> 40:35.041
- But she's still talking.

40:35.084 --> 40:37.217
- I'm super annoyed
that Porsha

40:37.260 --> 40:39.741
is clearly taking
Storm's side.

40:39.785 --> 40:42.352
At this point, I feel like
anything Storm says,

40:42.396 --> 40:43.876
she's just gonna be
over there,

40:43.919 --> 40:46.313
and it's a clear divide.

40:46.356 --> 40:48.446
- What happens here,
when you talk, she talks.

40:48.489 --> 40:49.882
All you see, is red.

40:49.925 --> 40:51.884
You're not hearing
each other anymore,

40:51.927 --> 40:54.974
and that's counterproductive.

40:55.017 --> 40:57.063
- You know, honestly,
I'm gonna be real wit' you.

40:57.106 --> 40:59.282
At this time,
I'm not-I'm not open

40:59.326 --> 41:02.068
to gettin' to know you.

41:02.111 --> 41:04.853
I don't want to.

41:04.897 --> 41:06.333
- Storm, I've tried
to be nice to you.

41:06.376 --> 41:07.552
I've tried to say, "Hey."

41:07.595 --> 41:08.901
- No, no, you're not--
- Storm, let her--

41:08.944 --> 41:10.250
let her finish.
- Wait a minute.

41:10.293 --> 41:11.860
- We let you finish, Storm.
- I did but no.

41:11.904 --> 41:14.036
- Storm, let her finish. Storm!
- Now, you're interrupting.

41:14.080 --> 41:15.168
Now, you're interrupting.
- Storm, let her fin--

41:15.211 --> 41:16.909
let her-- let her
finish the story.

41:16.952 --> 41:18.519
- Let's just have a pause.

41:18.563 --> 41:21.087
- Everyone has talked
when I was talking.

41:21.130 --> 41:22.480
Okay.
- But you were talk--

41:22.523 --> 41:23.698
you literally interrupted
when she was talking.

41:23.742 --> 41:25.352
- That's not true.
Y'all did. Y'all did.

41:25.395 --> 41:28.094
Everyone interrupted.
- About a traumatic
situation, Londie.

41:28.137 --> 41:30.575
You're not even listening.

41:30.618 --> 41:32.838
- If you feel like
I offended you yesterday,

41:32.881 --> 41:34.317
then I apologize.

41:34.361 --> 41:36.232
- The same way
that you have triggers,

41:36.276 --> 41:37.799
I'm just trying to
get you to understand

41:37.843 --> 41:39.453
that I have triggers.

41:39.497 --> 41:41.107
- I don't wanna trigger anybody
'cause I don't want

41:41.150 --> 41:44.066
people to trigger me.

41:44.110 --> 41:46.504
- Aho.
Aho.

41:46.547 --> 41:51.378
It is what it is.

41:51.421 --> 41:52.553
- We'll have some fun
tomorrow.

41:52.597 --> 41:53.902
We'll do some ATVs.
- Thank you.

41:53.946 --> 41:56.122
- We'll figure out
who is gonna go to the spa,

41:56.165 --> 41:57.819
who is gonna go to
the tequila bar.

41:57.863 --> 41:59.647
- No more crying.
- Healing is fun.

41:59.691 --> 42:01.127
- Now, in the morning,
we're gonna start with
walking meditation.

42:01.170 --> 42:02.476
- How do you walk
and meditate?

42:05.348 --> 42:07.873
- Next time on
"Porsha's Family Matters"...

42:07.916 --> 42:09.614
- Whoa, [BLEEP]!

42:09.657 --> 42:11.529
Oh, [BLEEP]!

42:11.572 --> 42:13.835
- We start with
the silver tequila.

42:13.879 --> 42:15.881
- Cheers.

42:15.924 --> 42:17.273
Can we slow down?

42:17.317 --> 42:18.971
- What are you
fixing within you?

42:19.014 --> 42:20.973
- I feel like I am fixed.

42:21.016 --> 42:23.323
- You're not, and I know
you're not doing the work,

42:23.366 --> 42:25.543
and this was your idea.

42:25.586 --> 42:26.979
- I never
- Dom, you did.

42:27.022 --> 42:28.197
Okay.
- Talk-- talk that sh--.

42:28.241 --> 42:29.329
- Who caught him cheating?

42:29.372 --> 42:32.288
- Oh, let's fight!

42:32.332 --> 42:34.508
- Dennis thinks that Dom
is a bit of a snake.

42:34.552 --> 42:36.162
- Because he said that
I should have never told you

42:36.205 --> 42:37.250
when I--
- Yeah, you're snitching.

42:37.293 --> 42:39.426
Why you worried
about my penis, bro?

42:39.469 --> 42:41.994
- It's very petty--
petty and immature.

42:42.037 --> 42:44.605
- Simon wouldn't sleep
with his young bartender.

42:44.649 --> 42:46.607
- What the [BLEEP],
huh, Bro?

42:46.651 --> 42:47.913
- Get him out.

42:47.956 --> 42:49.175
He needs to get
the outta here,

42:49.218 --> 42:50.916
him, and his sluts,
and his mother.

42:50.959 --> 42:51.743
- Shut up!

42:51.786 --> 42:53.353
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

42:53.396 --> 42:56.965
- [BLEEP]!

42:57.009 --> 43:01.009
- Oh, my God!
- [BLEEP], [BLEEP], [BLEEP]!
