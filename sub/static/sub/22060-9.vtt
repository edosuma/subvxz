WEBVTT

00:03.539 --> 00:05.506
The answer's no, Eddie.

00:05.508 --> 00:07.976
Fantasy football
is a blast.

00:07.978 --> 00:09.410
I'm second
in my league.

00:09.412 --> 00:11.479
I just need a little
help with the playoffs.

00:11.481 --> 00:12.447
I don't gamble.

00:12.449 --> 00:15.183
It's not gambling,
exactly.

00:15.185 --> 00:16.985
Look, I already have
a fantasy football team.

00:16.987 --> 00:18.253
Okay? It's called the Jets.

00:18.255 --> 00:20.054
Every year, I fantasize
they're not gonna suck.

00:20.056 --> 00:21.022
What's that?

00:21.024 --> 00:22.957
Kenneth Tripp. Child predator.

00:22.959 --> 00:24.359
413 Third Avenue,
Apartment 1B.

00:24.361 --> 00:26.261
"Protect your kids."

00:27.529 --> 00:28.763
Excuse me, sir.

00:28.765 --> 00:30.498
Do you live here?

00:30.500 --> 00:32.066
Michael Ruiz. I'm in 3G.

00:32.067 --> 00:33.501
Ah, that's a
tough situation.

00:33.503 --> 00:35.103
Yeah. I got three little girls.

00:35.105 --> 00:36.771
My wife and I
moved to this neighborhood

00:36.773 --> 00:38.706
because it was supposed to be
safe for kids.

00:38.708 --> 00:40.008
You sure about this guy Tripp?

00:40.010 --> 00:41.376
Yeah, found his name online.

00:41.378 --> 00:42.944
He's a Level 2 sex offender.

00:42.946 --> 00:44.078
He spent
15 months in jail

00:44.080 --> 00:45.947
for molesting
a nine-year-old kid.

00:45.949 --> 00:47.548
You guys got to do something.

00:47.550 --> 00:49.584
Uh, we-we'll check him out,

00:49.586 --> 00:51.252
but if he did his time
and he registered,

00:51.254 --> 00:53.454
there's really
not much we can do.

00:53.456 --> 00:55.757
You know, this guy
may have rights, but so do we.

00:55.759 --> 00:57.058
Our kids live here,

00:57.060 --> 00:58.726
they play here,
and we're scared.

00:58.728 --> 01:00.495
Who do we see about that?

01:07.303 --> 01:10.371
How much you think a school
like this costs a year?

01:10.373 --> 01:12.640
Got to be, what,
50 grand a year.

01:12.642 --> 01:14.108
Damn. Must be nice.

01:14.110 --> 01:15.610
That's only
starting in kindergarten.

01:15.612 --> 01:16.611
Wow.

01:16.613 --> 01:17.578
What do we got?

01:17.580 --> 01:20.515
Dylan Gardner, 17.

01:20.517 --> 01:22.350
Looks like he O.D.'d.
This was found in his hand.

01:22.352 --> 01:25.253
Doesn't look like milk
and cookies to me.

01:25.255 --> 01:27.555
Kid had it made;
why is he messing with drugs?

01:27.557 --> 01:29.157
Why does any kid
mess with drugs?

01:29.159 --> 01:31.359
I guess opioids are
everywhere these days.

01:31.361 --> 01:33.661
Let's see who he
spoke to last.

01:33.663 --> 01:34.862
Maybe we'll come up
with something.

01:34.864 --> 01:36.164
I'll get an emergency dump
on his phone.

01:36.166 --> 01:38.766
We're gonna want to
speak to his parents.

01:38.768 --> 01:39.901
They're probably
on their way.

01:39.903 --> 01:42.036
Poaching one of our cases again,
Detectives?

01:42.038 --> 01:44.572
Special Agent Bell?

01:44.574 --> 01:47.241
Fifth O.D. at a prep school
in the past six weeks.

01:47.243 --> 01:48.710
I'm running
the investigation

01:48.712 --> 01:50.178
for the Drug Enforcement
Task Force.

01:50.180 --> 01:52.080
You thinking all these
O.D.s are connected?

01:52.082 --> 01:53.214
That's what we're trying
to find out.

01:53.216 --> 01:54.849
You want some help with that?

01:54.851 --> 01:56.417
Last time we worked together,

01:56.419 --> 01:58.152
you two weren't exactly
team players.

01:58.154 --> 01:59.053
That's true.

01:59.055 --> 02:00.521
But then again, we did seize

02:00.523 --> 02:03.057
the largest pile of drug cash
in the history of New York.

02:03.059 --> 02:04.559
So there's that little tidbit.

02:04.561 --> 02:06.127
Promise to behave yourselves?

02:06.129 --> 02:07.862
Yes.
- No.

02:07.864 --> 02:09.464
Close enough. You're hired.

02:12.301 --> 02:14.602
We need to nail whoever's
spreading this poison.

02:17.406 --> 02:20.842
A van full of U.N.
delegates from West Africa

02:20.844 --> 02:22.477
got pulled over
at the Midtown Tunnel

02:22.479 --> 02:23.878
and detained for over an hour.

02:23.880 --> 02:25.012
For?

02:25.014 --> 02:26.781
We don't know, exactly.

02:26.783 --> 02:28.616
Because of the delay,
they missed a vote.

02:28.618 --> 02:30.118
We're expecting an
angry phone call

02:30.120 --> 02:32.153
from the secretary
general's office.

02:32.155 --> 02:33.788
And by "we," I mean me.

02:33.790 --> 02:37.058
And how come we don't know
why they were detained?

02:37.060 --> 02:38.926
'Cause it wasn't our guys
that pulled them over.

02:38.928 --> 02:40.395
Was state troopers.

02:40.397 --> 02:42.797
What?

02:42.799 --> 02:44.165
Apparently the governor
assigned extra manpower

02:44.167 --> 02:46.667
to all bridge and
tunnel crossings.

02:46.669 --> 02:49.003
And yes, without informing
our office.

02:49.005 --> 02:51.105
Did I miss a credible threat?

02:51.107 --> 02:51.973
No.

02:51.975 --> 02:54.108
These yo-yos were
the only threat.

02:54.110 --> 02:56.811
Pulling random checks.
Tunnel was jammed for hours.

02:56.813 --> 02:57.979
Why weren't we notified?

02:57.981 --> 02:59.247
Our state police liaison

02:59.249 --> 03:01.082
said it came straight
from the governor's office

03:01.084 --> 03:04.619
with strict orders
not to inform the NYPD.

03:04.621 --> 03:06.454
That's a how, not a why.

03:06.456 --> 03:07.555
My money's on our mayor.

03:07.557 --> 03:08.890
The mayor's part of it?

03:08.892 --> 03:11.159
Oh, no, I bet the mayor's
out of it, too, on purpose.

03:11.161 --> 03:12.260
Purpose being?

03:12.262 --> 03:13.428
Just conjecture here,

03:13.430 --> 03:15.129
but Mayor Poole had
a lot of friends in Albany

03:15.131 --> 03:17.198
that helped keep the governor's
bullying in check.

03:17.200 --> 03:19.100
Mayor Dutton has no such pull.

03:19.102 --> 03:21.602
And according to my sources,
when the guv denied her request

03:21.604 --> 03:24.205
for backup when we had
the riots on Rikers,

03:24.207 --> 03:25.840
she kind of went off on him.

03:25.842 --> 03:27.642
She do her homework
on the governor?

03:27.644 --> 03:28.943
No way of knowing.
Guy's got thinner skin

03:28.945 --> 03:30.912
than a grape;
who doesn't know that?

03:30.914 --> 03:33.848
From what I've seen, she doesn't
always read a room real good.

03:33.850 --> 03:35.783
What about Carter?

03:35.785 --> 03:37.785
You mean Carlton?
What about Carlton?

03:37.787 --> 03:39.720
What about Carlton?
That wasn't a question.

03:39.722 --> 03:42.123
Oh. Right.

03:46.295 --> 03:49.630
We got your number from
Dylan Gardner's phone.

03:49.632 --> 03:51.432
Um, how do you and he
know each other?

03:51.434 --> 03:53.801
Uh, Dylan is a student of mine.

03:53.803 --> 03:55.837
You teach at
Garson Academy?

03:55.839 --> 03:57.905
Literature and composition.

03:57.907 --> 04:00.274
And you're taking
the day off today?

04:00.276 --> 04:01.342
I, uh...

04:01.344 --> 04:02.977
just trying to shake a cold.

04:04.913 --> 04:08.883
So, you and Dylan, what'd
you guys talk about?

04:08.885 --> 04:10.284
I really can't recall.

04:10.286 --> 04:12.286
That's interesting.
It was just a few hours ago.

04:12.288 --> 04:13.321
No recollection, huh?

04:13.323 --> 04:15.189
Is there, uh, is there
a problem here?

04:15.191 --> 04:17.658
Yeah, actually there is
a little bit of a problem.

04:17.660 --> 04:19.660
Dylan overdosed. He's dead.

04:19.661 --> 04:22.630
But that-that can't be true.

04:22.632 --> 04:23.631
No, it's true.

04:23.633 --> 04:24.999
You know anything about that?

04:25.001 --> 04:27.201
What the hell is this?

04:30.939 --> 04:32.807
Oh, I-I, I can explain that.

04:32.809 --> 04:34.809
You can explain down
at the squad room.

04:34.811 --> 04:36.477
You're under arrest
for criminal possession

04:36.479 --> 04:37.745
of a controlled substance.

04:37.747 --> 04:39.380
Give me your hand.

04:41.617 --> 04:43.484
Is that something
you do all the time?

04:43.486 --> 04:45.486
You know, get high
with your students?

04:45.488 --> 04:47.622
It wasn't a social thing.
I'm addicted to this stuff.

04:47.624 --> 04:49.690
Yeah, kind of figured
out that part.

04:49.692 --> 04:50.858
Danny.

04:50.860 --> 04:52.460
No, I'm just
saying, you know.

04:52.462 --> 04:54.495
Is it something he does
for extra credit or what?

04:54.497 --> 04:55.496
I don't know.

04:55.498 --> 04:57.064
Does he grade
him on it?

04:57.066 --> 04:58.432
Danny.

04:58.434 --> 05:00.101
Detective,
something's wrong.

05:00.103 --> 05:01.235
What?

05:01.237 --> 05:04.238
Baez? Hey.
Hey, what's the matter?

05:04.240 --> 05:05.540
She's overdosing.

05:05.542 --> 05:07.909
She what?!
What are you talking about?!

05:07.911 --> 05:09.844
The tray she picked up,
there was fentanyl on it.

05:09.846 --> 05:11.679
We got to get her
to a hospital, now!

05:11.681 --> 05:12.947
Hey, Baez!

05:13.983 --> 05:15.650
Hang in there, okay? Hey!

05:15.652 --> 05:18.286
Hang on, partner!

05:18.288 --> 05:20.555
Code blue. Code blue.

05:22.959 --> 05:24.358
I'm Dr. Khan.

05:24.360 --> 05:25.893
Any idea what she came
in contact with?

05:25.895 --> 05:27.528
Perp said she got fentanyl
on her hands.

05:27.530 --> 05:29.964
Explains the extreme reaction.
Naloxone stat.

05:29.966 --> 05:31.032
Prep cubicle 2.

05:31.034 --> 05:32.133
What the hell's happening here?

05:32.135 --> 05:33.968
She was fine one second,
the next minute,

05:33.970 --> 05:35.169
she's not breathing.

05:35.171 --> 05:36.537
Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid.

05:36.539 --> 05:38.239
50 to 100 times
stronger than morphine.

05:38.241 --> 05:41.208
The slightest exposure
can trigger an overdose.

05:41.210 --> 05:42.843
What are you saying?

05:42.845 --> 05:44.478
My partner's gonna
wake up, right?

05:44.480 --> 05:46.147
Tell me she's gonna wake up!

05:46.149 --> 05:48.816
Look, fentanyl has a profound
impact on respiratory function.

05:48.818 --> 05:50.651
Hopefully, you got her
here in time.

05:50.653 --> 05:51.619
Wait.

05:51.621 --> 05:54.422
We'll do everything we can.

You mind telling me
what we're doing here, Reagan?

06:30.105 --> 06:31.871
Just want to
talk to the guy.

06:31.873 --> 06:33.406
Tripp's been clean
since he got out.

06:33.408 --> 06:35.608
His parole officer said
he's been a model citizen.

06:35.610 --> 06:38.678
Tell that to the people
living in this building.

06:38.680 --> 06:41.080
What if he, what if
he claims harassment?

06:41.082 --> 06:43.616
You want to wait in the car?

06:45.686 --> 06:47.453
No.

06:56.196 --> 06:57.663
Can I help you?

06:57.665 --> 06:58.631
Kenneth Tripp?

06:58.633 --> 07:00.166
Yes.

07:00.168 --> 07:01.634
I'm Officer Reagan.
This is Officer Janko.

07:01.636 --> 07:02.935
We understand you're
new to the building.

07:02.937 --> 07:04.470
That's right.

07:04.472 --> 07:07.140
Nice place. Lot of families.

07:07.142 --> 07:08.574
So we make
sure to keep

07:08.576 --> 07:10.042
a real close eye out on patrol.

07:10.044 --> 07:12.178
I see.

07:12.180 --> 07:14.881
We just want you to know you can
feel real safe living here.

07:14.883 --> 07:17.083
I'm well aware that my neighbors
don't want me here, Officers.

07:17.085 --> 07:19.585
So why choose
a family building like this?

07:19.587 --> 07:21.721
Because my mother lives
a couple of blocks from here.

07:21.723 --> 07:23.356
She isn't well;
I take care of her.

07:23.358 --> 07:24.957
Well, why not move in with her?

07:27.294 --> 07:29.429
Because she lives
in a school zone.

07:29.431 --> 07:31.164
Which would violate your parole.

07:31.166 --> 07:32.398
Yes.

07:33.667 --> 07:35.902
Now, look, I haven't done
anything wrong.

07:35.904 --> 07:37.937
I just want to be left alone.
Parents in this building

07:37.939 --> 07:40.039
are saying the same thing
about their kids.

07:41.408 --> 07:44.010
You need to respect that,
understand?

07:48.215 --> 07:49.849
I made a mistake.

07:49.851 --> 07:52.218
I paid the price,

07:52.220 --> 07:55.922
and now I'd just like
to live my life in peace.

07:58.058 --> 08:00.259
Excuse me.

08:07.868 --> 08:10.970
You're in a boatload
of trouble, Mr. Stratton.

08:10.972 --> 08:12.805
A teacher abusing
drugs is bad enough,

08:12.807 --> 08:14.707
but sharing them with the
students is a disgrace.

08:14.709 --> 08:16.509
I know I have a problem.
And you're gonna have

08:16.511 --> 08:18.845
an even bigger problem
if you're not straight with us.

08:18.847 --> 08:20.880
Did you sell Dylan the
drugs that killed him?

08:20.882 --> 08:22.715
What? What? No.
Answer the question!

08:22.717 --> 08:24.517
No, no. You've got,
you've got it all wrong.

08:24.519 --> 08:25.818
So set us straight.

08:25.820 --> 08:28.588
I-I wasn't Dylan's dealer.

08:28.590 --> 08:29.989
I was his customer.

08:29.991 --> 08:31.924
Oh, you want us to believe
that you bought

08:31.926 --> 08:33.192
the drugs from the kid?

08:33.193 --> 08:34.494
Is that what you're saying?

08:34.496 --> 08:36.996
Look, I had kidney stone
surgery last year.

08:36.998 --> 08:38.264
I left the hospital

08:38.265 --> 08:39.966
addicted to hydrocodone.

08:39.967 --> 08:40.933
When the doctors
finally wouldn't

08:40.934 --> 08:41.967
prescribe me any more...

08:41.970 --> 08:43.336
You turned to one
of your students.

08:43.337 --> 08:45.605
Yeah, real pathetic.
Never heard of rehab?

08:45.607 --> 08:47.673
Yeah. I tried it twice.

08:47.675 --> 08:50.376
At least you're still breathing,
unlike Dylan Gardner.

08:57.584 --> 08:59.952
He's in withdrawal.

08:59.954 --> 09:02.188
Maybe his memory will improve
after he sees a doctor.

09:02.190 --> 09:03.756
Good. Then I'll call him a bus.

09:03.758 --> 09:05.625
Reagan.

09:05.627 --> 09:07.226
She's gonna make it.

09:07.228 --> 09:09.762
Yeah.

09:09.764 --> 09:11.964
She isn't scheduled to leave
Bronx Botanical

09:11.966 --> 09:13.266
for another half hour.

09:13.268 --> 09:14.634
You are welcome to wait.

09:14.636 --> 09:15.902
Carter...
Carlton.

09:15.904 --> 09:17.670
Sorry. Carlton.

09:17.672 --> 09:20.039
We have
a packed day ourselves.

09:20.041 --> 09:21.974
Then why are you here
a half hour early

09:21.976 --> 09:24.443
for someone who is always
a half hour late?

09:24.445 --> 09:25.578
Must've been
a screwup on your end.

09:25.580 --> 09:27.847
I had us down for 4:00 sharp.

09:27.849 --> 09:29.148
I didn't screw up.

09:29.150 --> 09:30.850
Doesn't matter.

09:30.852 --> 09:32.285
Is the mayor aware

09:32.287 --> 09:36.589
that the governor platooned
state troopers to her city?

09:36.591 --> 09:38.791
Yes.

09:38.793 --> 09:41.894
The incident with the U.N.
delegates was unfortunate.

09:41.896 --> 09:43.629
She called
the secretary general's office

09:43.631 --> 09:44.997
as soon as she heard.

09:44.999 --> 09:47.266
So she didn't get
a heads-up either.

09:47.268 --> 09:49.602
The transportation
hubs fall

09:49.604 --> 09:50.970
within state police
jurisdiction.

09:50.972 --> 09:53.439
The governor has
every right to act

09:53.441 --> 09:56.409
independently of us and you.

09:57.444 --> 09:58.444
You work for him now?

09:58.446 --> 10:00.179
No, I work for the mayor.

10:00.181 --> 10:01.247
Me, too.

10:01.249 --> 10:03.516
Here we are, just
a couple of worker bees

10:03.518 --> 10:05.518
shooting the breeze.

10:05.520 --> 10:07.086
What do you want?

10:08.488 --> 10:11.657
There has always been overlap
between city and state cops.

10:11.659 --> 10:15.261
We've been able to manage it
through effective communication.

10:15.263 --> 10:16.562
Until now.

10:16.564 --> 10:20.366
This governor has
a tendency to overreach.

10:22.102 --> 10:23.402
And our boss?

10:23.404 --> 10:26.272
Has a tendency to,
shall we say...

10:26.274 --> 10:27.807
Drag her feet.
Backpedal.

10:27.809 --> 10:30.176
Weigh each side
carefully before...

10:30.178 --> 10:31.210
Flip-flopping?

10:31.212 --> 10:34.080
Coming to an informed decision.

10:34.082 --> 10:37.550
As was her strength
as public advocate.

10:37.552 --> 10:40.052
Look, she doesn't want to go up
against this governor.

10:40.054 --> 10:41.621
Smart.

10:41.623 --> 10:43.356
You think?
I do.

10:43.358 --> 10:44.690
You do?

10:44.692 --> 10:46.959
It is a law enforcement issue

10:46.961 --> 10:50.396
and one that is best left
to her police commissioner.

10:50.398 --> 10:52.298
Easier said than done.

10:52.300 --> 10:54.800
But easily said.
We'll take the done part.

10:54.802 --> 10:56.669
You sound very confident.

10:56.671 --> 10:59.872
Oh, don't be fooled.
I'm just pretty confident.

10:59.874 --> 11:02.274
So you'll see to this?

11:02.276 --> 11:05.111
I will advise her, yes.

11:05.113 --> 11:08.247
And what were we in
here talking about?

11:08.249 --> 11:11.384
The tree lighting
and the ball drop.

11:11.386 --> 11:13.219
Copy that.

11:25.432 --> 11:27.266
Thanks.

11:32.072 --> 11:34.306
Hey, partner.

11:34.308 --> 11:38.044
Stopped by your place,

11:38.046 --> 11:40.379
and figured you might,
uh, want to see

11:40.381 --> 11:43.749
some familiar faces
when you wake up.

11:43.751 --> 11:47.219
Instead of my ugly mug.

11:47.221 --> 11:49.121
Everyone at the squad's
pulling for you.

11:49.123 --> 11:52.758
Told them they got
nothing to worry about.

11:52.760 --> 11:57.763
And I am leaning in real hard
on, uh, that teacher.

12:04.137 --> 12:06.972
I probably don't
say it enough, but...

12:06.974 --> 12:09.775
you're one hell of a cop.

12:09.777 --> 12:13.012
And you're one
hell of a partner.

12:18.151 --> 12:22.021
I really, really
need you to wake up.

12:24.691 --> 12:28.060
I really can't afford
to lose you, too.

12:39.107 --> 12:42.675
So, uh...

12:42.677 --> 12:46.112
I'm just gonna have a seat here
until you stop being stubborn...

12:47.948 --> 12:49.615
...and wake up.

12:55.021 --> 12:56.889
This guy Tripp's
following the law, Jamie.

12:56.891 --> 12:58.657
I don't care what he says
about being reformed.

12:58.659 --> 13:00.292
Those parents have
a right to be worried.

13:00.294 --> 13:02.895
You're right. So they need to
keep a closer eye on their kids.

13:02.897 --> 13:04.363
And we need to do the same.

13:04.365 --> 13:06.198
I'm just saying it's not fair,
that's all.

13:06.200 --> 13:08.567
Sometimes fair's got
nothing to do with it.

13:08.569 --> 13:10.603
12-David, be advised,

13:10.605 --> 13:13.506
you have a 10-24
front of 413 Third Avenue.

13:13.508 --> 13:14.740
That's Tripp's building.

13:23.984 --> 13:25.217
Hey, police!

13:25.219 --> 13:26.786
Step back.
Step aside.

13:26.788 --> 13:28.921
- Step aside. Police.
- Hey. Back up.

13:28.923 --> 13:30.689
Back up.

13:32.025 --> 13:34.093
- It's Tripp.
- I'm calling a bus.

13:34.095 --> 13:36.529
Central, 12-David, we need
a bus at this location.

13:37.664 --> 13:39.465
Anybody see who did this?

13:44.738 --> 13:46.405
Nobody saw anything?

14:07.660 --> 14:08.959
Mr. Ruiz.

14:09.928 --> 14:11.262
We need to talk to you.

14:11.264 --> 14:14.098
I'll meet you
guys at home.

14:19.604 --> 14:21.272
What can I do for you?

14:21.274 --> 14:22.306
Kenneth Tripp was assaulted

14:22.308 --> 14:23.741
outside your building
last night.

14:23.743 --> 14:25.242
Someone beat him up pretty bad.

14:25.244 --> 14:26.811
What happened to your hand?

14:28.880 --> 14:32.683
Look, I... I wasn't
looking for trouble, okay?

14:32.685 --> 14:33.984
I'm not a violent person.

14:33.986 --> 14:35.119
Tell us what happened.

14:35.121 --> 14:36.754
I came home from work.

14:36.756 --> 14:38.422
Tripp was headed
out of the building.

14:38.424 --> 14:40.224
We started going back and forth
about him living there.

14:40.226 --> 14:41.659
How did Tripp end up
on the ground?

14:41.661 --> 14:43.994
I said what I had to say,
started to head inside.

14:43.996 --> 14:46.263
The next thing I know,
he hits me.

14:46.265 --> 14:47.398
You're saying Tripp threw
the first punch?

14:47.400 --> 14:48.599
Yeah. I had no choice.

14:48.601 --> 14:49.733
I had to defend myself.

14:49.735 --> 14:50.935
Why would Tripp
go after

14:50.937 --> 14:52.069
someone twice his size?

14:52.071 --> 14:54.405
Why would he go after
a kid half his size?

14:54.407 --> 14:55.606
All right,

14:55.608 --> 14:56.674
we're gonna need you
to come down

14:56.676 --> 14:57.808
to the precinct,
talk with a detective.

14:57.810 --> 14:59.143
Am I under arrest?

14:59.145 --> 15:00.744
Not if you come voluntarily.

15:08.653 --> 15:10.287
Right here?

15:12.157 --> 15:13.357
Nigel Lewis.

15:13.359 --> 15:14.491
Yes?

15:14.493 --> 15:16.660
Detective Reagan.
Special Agent Bell.

15:16.662 --> 15:18.395
Are you here about Dylan?

15:18.397 --> 15:20.297
We hear you two were
really good friends.

15:20.299 --> 15:22.399
Um, yeah. Dylan was the best.

15:22.401 --> 15:24.001
I-I can't believe he's gone.

15:24.003 --> 15:26.036
Yeah, he is gone,
and we'd like to make sure

15:26.038 --> 15:27.972
no other kids go
the same way he did.

15:27.974 --> 15:29.340
We know that Dylan
was selling drugs.

15:29.342 --> 15:31.041
What can you tell us about that?

15:31.043 --> 15:33.177
Uh, nothing.

15:33.179 --> 15:34.511
Nothing at all?
Well, that's interesting,

15:34.513 --> 15:36.146
'cause one of
your teachers told us

15:36.148 --> 15:37.815
that you and Dylan
used to party together

15:37.817 --> 15:40.184
and we may want to take
a peek inside your locker.

15:40.186 --> 15:42.553
Um, you can go ahead.
You're not gonna find anything.

15:42.555 --> 15:43.787
We want to know

15:43.789 --> 15:45.456
where Dylan got
the drugs he sold.

15:45.458 --> 15:47.691
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

15:47.693 --> 15:49.560
Can I go to class?

15:49.562 --> 15:51.762
No. Actually,
you can't go, okay?

15:51.764 --> 15:53.797
We're not playing
a game here, okay?

15:53.799 --> 15:56.066
Now, you're not the guy
we're looking for,

15:56.068 --> 15:58.135
but you very well could be,
you understand?

15:58.137 --> 16:01.105
With all due respect,
based on what?

16:01.107 --> 16:04.341
Uh, the word of a drug addict
teacher and a bunch of hearsay?

16:04.343 --> 16:07.344
You seem like
a pretty smart kid, Nigel.

16:07.346 --> 16:09.413
Trust me, I know
a lot of smart kids

16:09.415 --> 16:11.582
who end up in prison for drugs.

16:11.584 --> 16:12.650
She's right.

16:12.652 --> 16:14.952
My mom's a criminal defense
attorney.

16:14.954 --> 16:17.421
If you're gonna arrest me
without probable cause,

16:17.423 --> 16:19.723
she'll be waiting
at the precinct.

16:19.725 --> 16:21.592
Uh, can I go to class now?

16:21.594 --> 16:24.695
Get the hell out of here.

16:29.334 --> 16:33.304
I used to play baseball
against prep school kids.

16:33.306 --> 16:35.105
The fights were the best part.

16:38.009 --> 16:41.946
Please don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

16:43.816 --> 16:45.916
Great to see you, Frank.

16:45.918 --> 16:46.951
Welcome to One PP.

16:46.953 --> 16:48.185
Let's get a few shots. Billy?

16:48.187 --> 16:49.687
Uh, please,
right this way, Governor.

16:56.795 --> 16:59.596
Right this way,
please, Governor.

16:59.598 --> 17:01.432
Please, have a seat.

17:01.434 --> 17:03.734
May I get you
some coffee? Water?

17:03.736 --> 17:05.536
No, thanks.

17:10.308 --> 17:12.276
I'll make sure the
governor's staff is comfortable

17:12.278 --> 17:13.477
and that
you're not disturbed.

17:13.479 --> 17:14.678
Thank you, Baker.

17:18.083 --> 17:20.651
Thank you for coming up here.

17:20.653 --> 17:23.252
We're alone now,
so you don't need to--

17:23.255 --> 17:24.454
Unless you record

17:24.457 --> 17:26.690
conversations in here.

17:26.692 --> 17:27.958
I don't.

17:27.960 --> 17:31.195
Then we don't need
to waste time faking friendly.

17:31.197 --> 17:32.763
I spoke to the secretary general

17:32.765 --> 17:34.565
about the incident
with his people.

17:34.567 --> 17:36.333
Smoothed things over for you.

17:36.335 --> 17:37.301
For me?

17:37.303 --> 17:38.702
For you and Dutton.

17:38.704 --> 17:41.071
If you don't want
to thank me, fine.

17:41.073 --> 17:43.874
You don't get to be the arsonist
and the firefighter.

17:43.876 --> 17:44.908
What's that mean?

17:44.910 --> 17:46.577
Means you don't get
a big thank you

17:46.579 --> 17:48.212
for cleaning up a mess you made.

17:48.214 --> 17:50.147
I didn't make a mess.

17:50.149 --> 17:52.082
My troopers stopped
six foreigners in a van.

17:52.084 --> 17:53.250
Your cops never did that?

17:53.252 --> 17:55.119
Not a van with
diplomatic plates,

17:55.121 --> 17:57.087
not the way your troopers did.

17:57.089 --> 17:58.655
I also told them
to spread the word

17:58.657 --> 18:01.125
that we want the million dollars
in parking tickets paid up.

18:01.127 --> 18:04.595
So you can thank me for that.

18:06.431 --> 18:11.435
What you're doing, mixing
state troopers in with the NYPD,

18:11.437 --> 18:13.303
without any coordination...

18:13.305 --> 18:14.705
Is my call.

18:16.941 --> 18:20.077
You realize that it's my call
if I want to fire you?

18:20.079 --> 18:24.381
Takes more than a job threat to
scare me off, all due respect.

18:24.383 --> 18:27.284
Surely you'd rather leave here
on your own time

18:27.286 --> 18:30.521
and your own steam,
with all the applause

18:30.523 --> 18:33.123
and bagpipes,
than from a sudden eviction.

18:33.125 --> 18:35.793
Be honest.

18:35.795 --> 18:39.029
Why are you here?

18:39.031 --> 18:43.233
A ceremony opening phase two of
the Second Avenue subway tunnel.

18:43.235 --> 18:46.103
I meant here, in my house.

18:46.105 --> 18:49.373
I want a state presence
in the security configuration

18:49.375 --> 18:51.375
this week, and you're
gonna support that.

18:51.377 --> 18:52.743
Bad idea.

18:52.745 --> 18:54.845
You can't have a successful
political profile these days

18:54.847 --> 18:56.814
without some
hands-on involvement

18:56.816 --> 18:58.916
in anti- and counterterrorism.

18:58.918 --> 19:00.551
Which makes it a good idea.

19:00.553 --> 19:02.019
Not like this.

19:02.021 --> 19:03.954
Just like this.

19:03.956 --> 19:08.325
The governor sensed that an
event publicizing a new tunnel

19:08.327 --> 19:11.428
might call attention
to our most vulnerable targets.

19:11.430 --> 19:13.964
Hence,
increased presence

19:13.966 --> 19:16.700
at all tunnels.

19:20.004 --> 19:22.172
And that's all you need to know.

19:29.181 --> 19:30.714
Although you have
not been charged,

19:30.716 --> 19:32.549
you still have the right
to remain silent

19:32.551 --> 19:34.618
or have a lawyer present.

19:34.620 --> 19:36.453
I have nothing to hide.

19:36.455 --> 19:37.955
I didn't do anything wrong.

19:37.957 --> 19:39.623
Put a guy half your size
in the hospital.

19:39.625 --> 19:40.924
I was defending myself.

19:40.926 --> 19:43.861
You claim that
Kenneth Tripp struck you?

19:43.863 --> 19:45.596
That's right.
Do you have any bruising

19:45.598 --> 19:47.131
or defensive wounds?

19:47.133 --> 19:48.732
No.

19:48.734 --> 19:50.767
How many times you hit him?
I don't know.

19:50.769 --> 19:52.302
I'm not used to being attacked.

19:52.304 --> 19:54.605
Mr. Tripp is still unconscious

19:54.607 --> 19:56.740
after receiving
a severe beating.

19:56.742 --> 19:58.842
Well, maybe he should learn
to keep his hands to himself.

19:58.844 --> 20:00.077
With everybody.

20:00.079 --> 20:03.814
So you maintain that Mr. Tripp
posed a threat to you?

20:03.816 --> 20:05.916
He poses a threat
to everyone in the building,

20:05.918 --> 20:07.451
especially our kids.

20:07.453 --> 20:08.752
Okay, but that kind of threat

20:08.754 --> 20:10.954
does not give you the right
to assault him.

20:13.791 --> 20:15.492
You guys have kids?

20:15.494 --> 20:18.262
I have a daughter.

20:18.264 --> 20:19.563
Two boys and a girl.

20:19.565 --> 20:20.731
Okay.

20:20.733 --> 20:23.066
So put yourself in our place.

20:23.068 --> 20:25.269
This guy's a predator. Right?

20:25.271 --> 20:26.537
You can't watch

20:26.539 --> 20:28.038
your kids 24/7.

20:28.040 --> 20:29.573
What would you do?

20:31.009 --> 20:33.744
I would not resort
to vigilante violence.

20:33.746 --> 20:37.047
Look, you have my statement.

20:37.049 --> 20:39.583
I protected myself
and my family.

20:39.585 --> 20:41.451
And I'd do it again.

20:48.693 --> 20:50.527
What do we got?

20:50.529 --> 20:52.930
17-year-old male.
Apparent O.D.

20:52.932 --> 20:54.131
Where is he?

20:54.133 --> 20:55.933
He's right over here.

21:07.213 --> 21:08.645
Nigel Lewis.

21:11.449 --> 21:12.683
Anybody with him?

21:12.685 --> 21:13.951
The girlfriend's over there.

21:16.621 --> 21:18.288
Excuse me.

21:18.290 --> 21:19.489
Detective Reagan.

21:19.491 --> 21:21.225
Special Agent Bell.
Hi.

21:21.227 --> 21:22.125
What's your name?

21:22.127 --> 21:23.627
Eva Gold.

21:23.629 --> 21:24.628
Can you tell us what happened?

21:24.630 --> 21:27.231
It was that jerk Paul.

21:27.233 --> 21:28.699
Who's Paul?

21:28.701 --> 21:29.933
He's a dealer.

21:29.935 --> 21:31.201
He partied with Nigel.

21:31.203 --> 21:34.471
Showed up, like, an
hour ago.

21:34.473 --> 21:36.840
After what happened to Dylan,

21:36.842 --> 21:39.643
I begged Nigel
to stay away from him.

21:39.645 --> 21:40.844
His stuff's too strong.

21:40.846 --> 21:42.613
Okay. We need
to know everything

21:42.615 --> 21:44.781
about this guy Paul.

21:59.609 --> 22:01.276
It's hard to walk
in those shoes till you got

22:01.278 --> 22:02.510
kids of your own
is all I'm saying.

22:02.512 --> 22:04.012
Seriously?
- Yes.

22:04.014 --> 22:06.848
Look, you gamble
that a child molester

22:06.850 --> 22:09.551
moving in next door to you has
been successfully rehabbed,

22:09.553 --> 22:12.120
what you're actually gambling
with is your own kids' safety.

22:12.122 --> 22:14.789
Not all sexual predators
repeat their crimes.

22:14.791 --> 22:15.924
No, but
many of them do,

22:15.926 --> 22:17.692
and it's hard
to tell them apart.

22:17.694 --> 22:18.927
So he deserved a beating?

22:18.929 --> 22:20.395
For what?
Something he might do?

22:20.397 --> 22:21.529
I didn't say deserved,

22:21.531 --> 22:23.631
but I understand the guy
who gave him the beating.

22:23.633 --> 22:25.033
Man did his time, period.

22:25.035 --> 22:26.034
- Oh...
- Come on, Dad.

22:26.036 --> 22:27.869
You know it's
not that simple.

22:27.871 --> 22:29.571
I do, but if you
selectively toss

22:29.573 --> 22:31.306
the compact of
crime and punishment,

22:31.308 --> 22:32.907
you're in
<i>Lord of the Flies</i> land.

22:32.909 --> 22:34.409
And by your logic,

22:34.411 --> 22:36.277
someone convicted
of that kind of crime

22:36.279 --> 22:38.046
should just be
locked up forever.

22:38.048 --> 22:39.147
Yes, they should.

22:39.149 --> 22:40.782
And if a beatdown
serves as a warning

22:40.784 --> 22:43.685
or a deterrent to some child
molester who beats the system,

22:43.687 --> 22:44.919
well, then so be it.

22:44.921 --> 22:46.087
Slippery slope

22:46.089 --> 22:47.789
is mild with that logic.

22:47.791 --> 22:49.891
More like an avalanche.

22:49.893 --> 22:50.859
Well...

22:50.861 --> 22:52.060
She's right.

22:52.062 --> 22:54.395
On paper, she's right.

22:54.397 --> 22:56.531
Well, that's where the laws
are written, on paper.

22:56.533 --> 22:57.665
Ah...

22:57.667 --> 22:59.400
This guy Tripp
molested a little girl.

22:59.402 --> 23:01.202
Okay, we do not need
to get into details.

23:01.204 --> 23:02.971
Come on, Mom.

23:02.973 --> 23:05.073
So we can defend the man,
but we can't name his crime?

23:05.075 --> 23:07.175
I'm not saying that.
Hmm.

23:07.177 --> 23:09.010
We know about predators.
This isn't new to us.

23:09.012 --> 23:10.678
Yeah, remember
"stranger danger"?

23:10.680 --> 23:13.648
Glad you know about it,
sorry you had to be taught.

23:13.650 --> 23:15.617
Look, when I first met Tripp,
he made my skin crawl,

23:15.619 --> 23:17.952
and it pissed me off
that he was living near kids.

23:17.954 --> 23:19.320
Damn right.

23:19.322 --> 23:20.822
But when I saw him
lying in the street,

23:20.824 --> 23:22.290
beaten to a pulp,
it bothered me.

23:22.292 --> 23:24.692
Because I can't just
look the other way.

23:24.694 --> 23:26.528
Because I'm sworn and paid
to look straight at it,

23:26.530 --> 23:27.796
to see it for what it is.

23:27.798 --> 23:28.663
Come on.

23:28.665 --> 23:30.031
He's right, Danny.

23:30.033 --> 23:31.399
That guy Ruiz was
defending his family

23:31.401 --> 23:32.734
from a predator.

23:32.736 --> 23:34.102
Amen to that.

23:34.104 --> 23:35.770
Well, actually, he wasn't.

23:35.772 --> 23:38.273
Sounds like he just made
a preemptive strike

23:38.275 --> 23:39.741
based on his own fears.

23:40.776 --> 23:42.243
But those are real fears.

23:42.245 --> 23:44.746
Exactly. I mean, let's just
say, when we were kids,

23:44.748 --> 23:46.748
some animal like Tripp
moved in next door.

23:46.750 --> 23:48.049
What would you do?

23:48.918 --> 23:50.585
Everything I could
to protect my kids.

23:50.587 --> 23:51.986
That's right.
Look, I get it.

23:51.988 --> 23:54.489
We are officers of
the law, and as such,

23:54.491 --> 23:57.158
we can't do anything until
an actual crime happens.

23:57.160 --> 23:58.092
That's the law.

23:58.094 --> 23:59.394
Okay, but what if the crime

23:59.396 --> 24:01.262
is going to happen,
and it's to your own child?

24:01.264 --> 24:02.697
Are you just gonna
let it happen?

24:02.699 --> 24:04.899
That's not
a fair question, Danny.

24:04.901 --> 24:06.501
Well, that's the question
Ruiz was facing.

24:06.503 --> 24:07.869
Wait, so given no choice,

24:07.871 --> 24:10.738
would you put the welfare
of your family above the law?

24:10.740 --> 24:13.074
Yes, I would.

24:13.076 --> 24:14.142
Thank you.

24:14.144 --> 24:16.144
But when the dust settled,

24:16.146 --> 24:19.614
I would walk down to the local
precinct and turn myself in.

24:19.616 --> 24:22.083
'Cause nobody's above the law.

24:22.085 --> 24:26.421
And without the law,
nobody's safe.

24:31.360 --> 24:33.494
It was here,
and then it was gone.

24:33.496 --> 24:35.797
You can't keep...
I didn't do anything..

24:35.799 --> 24:36.998
Wait, hold that thought.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.032
See if he saved it.

24:38.034 --> 24:39.667
Hey.

24:39.669 --> 24:42.136
Hey.

24:42.138 --> 24:43.071
Heading out?

24:43.073 --> 24:45.139
Yeah. Got a lead
on the drug dealer.

24:45.141 --> 24:46.708
How's your partner?
- Same.

24:46.710 --> 24:48.276
Doc says we just got to wait.

24:48.278 --> 24:50.845
And how you doing with that?

24:50.847 --> 24:52.680
Part of the job.

24:52.682 --> 24:54.382
Yeah, the unbearable part.

24:54.384 --> 24:56.885
Yeah. I should've known there
were drugs in the apartment.

24:56.887 --> 24:58.953
He was an English teacher,
Danny.

24:58.955 --> 25:00.088
Who was obviously off.

25:00.090 --> 25:01.556
Which I should've
recognized quicker,

25:01.558 --> 25:03.691
and I should've had
my partner's back.

25:07.329 --> 25:09.864
Dad...

25:09.866 --> 25:13.268
if bad things keep happening
around the same person,

25:13.270 --> 25:15.737
are they still just accidents?

25:15.739 --> 25:17.972
Don't make this about that.

25:17.974 --> 25:19.741
It's easier said than done.

25:19.743 --> 25:22.477
Shift your weight.

25:22.479 --> 25:24.445
You look for trouble
for a living.

25:24.447 --> 25:26.748
Sometimes trouble's
gonna find you.

25:26.750 --> 25:28.316
More than most, maybe.

25:28.318 --> 25:30.251
Okay.

25:30.253 --> 25:33.354
I'll try to keep more,
what, positive?

25:34.623 --> 25:37.191
You do a lot of good
in this world.

25:37.193 --> 25:39.394
More than most, maybe.

25:54.109 --> 25:56.010
Nigel's girlfriend gave us
the dealer's full name.

25:56.012 --> 25:58.313
Paul Romano. He's lived in
this building for three years.

26:01.650 --> 26:04.252
That's him. That's our guy.
Call it. Call it.

26:04.254 --> 26:05.386
Black jacket, jeans.

26:05.388 --> 26:06.828
Take your positions.
We're moving in.

26:13.896 --> 26:14.896
Paul Romano.

26:14.898 --> 26:16.965
Police.
Got a few questions for you.

26:16.967 --> 26:19.500
Sure.
Kill the engine.

26:19.502 --> 26:21.202
Yeah, no problem.
Come on, turn it off.

26:23.539 --> 26:25.006
You okay, Reagan?!
Yeah.

26:25.008 --> 26:27.342
Team 2, suspect is
heading your way!

26:38.320 --> 26:39.387
Freeze! Don't move!

26:39.389 --> 26:41.990
Out of the car!

26:41.992 --> 26:43.257
Get out.

26:43.259 --> 26:45.026
Get out of the car!
Turn around!

26:45.995 --> 26:46.961
Put your hands up there.

26:46.963 --> 26:48.162
You got any
weapons on you?

26:48.164 --> 26:50.098
No.
You sure about that?

26:51.134 --> 26:52.567
Oh, what do we got here?

26:52.569 --> 26:54.869
I thought you said you
didn't have any weapons.

26:55.771 --> 26:57.872
That look like
a weapon to you?

26:57.874 --> 26:59.374
I'd say that qualifies.

26:59.376 --> 27:02.543
Let's get this piece of crap
out of here.

27:02.545 --> 27:06.514
Almost an hour I'm on the phone
with Dave Keenan.

27:06.516 --> 27:08.549
We're both singing
the exact same song.

27:08.551 --> 27:09.450
Who's Dave Keenan?

27:09.452 --> 27:11.219
The superintendent
of state police.

27:11.221 --> 27:12.620
He doesn't want his
people down here

27:12.622 --> 27:14.022
any more than I do.

27:14.024 --> 27:15.256
And that counts for nothing?

27:15.258 --> 27:18.393
The governor sent down guys
who work border patrol.

27:18.395 --> 27:19.627
Good cops I'm sure,

27:19.629 --> 27:21.996
but he might as well have
dropped them on the moon.

27:21.998 --> 27:23.631
Maybe we should get
the mayor involved.

27:23.633 --> 27:24.766
Maybe it was a mistake.

27:24.768 --> 27:27.735
That would be compounded
by dragging her in now.

27:27.737 --> 27:30.271
Let me call my guy at the <i>Times,</i>
feed him what the governor's

27:30.273 --> 27:31.639
up to, off the record.
It'll explode.

27:31.641 --> 27:33.374
In my face.

27:33.376 --> 27:36.377
He'll figure out the source
in two seconds.

27:36.379 --> 27:38.579
Don't shoot the messenger.

27:38.581 --> 27:39.514
What now?

27:39.516 --> 27:40.715
Two plainclothes officers

27:40.717 --> 27:42.183
assigned to the Transit Bureau

27:42.185 --> 27:44.986
chasing an armed robbery suspect
through Penn Station.

27:44.988 --> 27:48.356
One of them has her gun and her
shield out when a state trooper

27:48.358 --> 27:50.992
appears out of nowhere
and takes a shot at her.

27:51.927 --> 27:54.429
Was she hit?

27:54.431 --> 27:56.831
No. Luckily the trooper
was reckless

27:56.833 --> 27:58.066
and a bad shot.

27:58.068 --> 28:00.101
Was the plainclothes wearing
the color of the day?

28:00.103 --> 28:01.602
Orange, on her shooting hand.

28:01.604 --> 28:03.004
Trooper know
the color of the day?

28:03.006 --> 28:06.541
I'm not sure they even know
we have such a thing.

28:09.111 --> 28:12.547
Says here you're a licensed
physical therapist, Mr. Romano.

28:12.549 --> 28:13.581
That's right.

28:13.583 --> 28:15.016
But you moonlight
as a drug dealer?

28:15.018 --> 28:16.451
Or is it the other way around?

28:16.453 --> 28:18.186
No comment.
How'd you get hooked up

28:18.188 --> 28:19.954
with Nigel Lewis
and Dylan Gardner?

28:19.956 --> 28:21.322
Dylan's dad was
a patient of mine.

28:21.324 --> 28:22.790
He's a smart kid.

28:22.792 --> 28:24.559
A real entrepreneur.

28:24.561 --> 28:26.794
Yeah, he's so smart, he turned
a grown man into a drug dealer.

28:26.796 --> 28:28.796
You have no proof
that I sold anything.

28:28.798 --> 28:30.431
All you have is that bag
you took off me.

28:30.433 --> 28:33.134
You had some serious
pharmaceuticals in there.

28:33.136 --> 28:34.502
I mean,

28:34.504 --> 28:36.537
that's why God created lawyers,
right?

28:36.539 --> 28:40.208
Possession buys me
probation, six months.

28:40.210 --> 28:42.877
Yeah. This guys really
knows his stuff.

28:42.879 --> 28:45.346
Yeah. Except that thing.

28:45.348 --> 28:47.181
Yeah, that thing.

28:47.183 --> 28:49.784
You ever been up
near Buffalo, Paul?

28:49.786 --> 28:51.352
Never had the pleasure.

28:51.354 --> 28:53.821
Cattaraugus County?
Some nice skiing up there.

28:53.823 --> 28:55.423
And why should I care?

28:55.425 --> 28:57.758
Because that's where an opioid
dealer was just sentenced

28:57.760 --> 29:00.528
for negligent homicide
for the first time.

29:01.630 --> 29:03.598
For the O.D. of one
of her very, very

29:03.600 --> 29:05.533
unfortunate customers.

29:06.768 --> 29:08.369
What's that, Paul?

29:08.371 --> 29:11.005
I don't hear you making
any smart-ass comments now.

29:11.007 --> 29:12.807
Well, you're never gonna make
that stick.

29:12.809 --> 29:14.175
As a matter of fact,

29:14.177 --> 29:16.410
I spoke to a state prosecutor
who assured me

29:16.412 --> 29:18.146
she'd make it stick.

29:18.148 --> 29:20.781
You're responsible for two O.D.s
that we know of.

29:20.783 --> 29:22.917
You sold heroin
that was laced with fentanyl,

29:22.919 --> 29:24.152
which you knew to be deadly.

29:24.154 --> 29:26.787
You put a New York City
detective in the hospital.

29:26.789 --> 29:28.489
You're going
to prison, Paul.

29:28.491 --> 29:31.559
But you got a chance to score
points for cooperating.

29:33.795 --> 29:35.763
I'm listening.

29:35.765 --> 29:38.366
The stuff you're selling
is not from some

29:38.368 --> 29:41.102
knock-off pill facility
in Mexico.

29:41.104 --> 29:42.603
You're pushing
pharmaceutical-grade opioids.

29:42.605 --> 29:46.374
Top-shelf stuff.
Where'd you get it?

29:47.342 --> 29:48.376
Where'd you get it?

29:48.378 --> 29:50.478
Every day I treat patients

29:50.480 --> 29:52.513
fresh out of the hospital,
right?

29:52.515 --> 29:54.615
Very well-medicated patients.

29:55.751 --> 29:57.218
- We're listening.
- These patients are prescribed

29:57.220 --> 29:59.187
more pain meds than they could
possibly need,

29:59.189 --> 30:00.788
and there's plenty
of folks out there

30:00.790 --> 30:02.490
who will pay top dollar
for the surplus.

30:02.492 --> 30:04.692
Rich prep school kids like
Nigel Lewis and Dylan Gardner.

30:04.694 --> 30:05.993
Yeah, that's right.

30:05.995 --> 30:07.328
It's called supply and demand.

30:07.330 --> 30:09.363
It's what made this
country great, right?

30:09.365 --> 30:11.332
You know, somehow, I don't think
the Founding Fathers

30:11.334 --> 30:13.501
would be very proud.
Now give us the names

30:13.503 --> 30:16.337
of whoever's
over-prescribing this crap.

30:36.278 --> 30:38.625
We arrested the dealer
who sold the drugs

30:38.626 --> 30:40.660
that poisoned
Detective Baez.

30:40.662 --> 30:41.661
That's great news.

30:41.663 --> 30:44.430
Maybe, but maybe not so great
for you.

30:44.432 --> 30:46.566
You're one of three
supervising ER physicians

30:46.568 --> 30:47.834
at this hospital, right?

30:47.836 --> 30:48.901
That's right.

30:48.903 --> 30:50.403
The man who sold the drugs
was a PT,

30:50.405 --> 30:51.604
purchased the drugs

30:51.606 --> 30:54.006
from patients
of local hospitals,

30:54.008 --> 30:55.641
including this hospital.

30:55.643 --> 30:58.244
- I don't understand.
- Your patients are selling

30:58.246 --> 31:00.213
their extra pain meds
to drug dealers.

31:00.215 --> 31:01.481
That's unfortunate,

31:01.483 --> 31:02.648
but shouldn't you
take this up with them?

31:02.650 --> 31:03.783
Well, we
wouldn't have

31:03.785 --> 31:05.518
to take it up with them
if docs like you

31:05.520 --> 31:08.554
weren't throwing these drugs
around like candy on Halloween.

31:11.759 --> 31:14.727
We prescribe opioids
to relieve pain.

31:14.729 --> 31:17.830
When used correctly these drugs
are extremely effective.

31:17.832 --> 31:19.766
And extremely addictive.

31:19.768 --> 31:21.134
Well, we provide our patients
with guidelines.

31:21.136 --> 31:22.702
We don't have the resources
to monitor compliance.

31:22.704 --> 31:25.138
By putting so much of this junk
out on the street,

31:25.140 --> 31:27.507
you're no better than the
drug dealers themselves, Doc.

31:27.509 --> 31:30.042
Wh-Why don't you spare me
the lecture?

31:30.044 --> 31:32.845
We're on the front lines,
Detective.

31:32.847 --> 31:35.181
We handle more trauma cases

31:35.183 --> 31:36.783
than any hospital in this city,

31:36.785 --> 31:38.785
with the highest survival rate.

31:38.787 --> 31:41.120
You're creating drug addicts.

31:41.122 --> 31:42.522
We're saving lives.

31:43.490 --> 31:46.292
Prescribing pain meds
is a medical decision,

31:46.294 --> 31:47.860
one which the NYPD

31:47.862 --> 31:49.562
is not qualified
to evaluate.

31:49.564 --> 31:50.863
Maybe, but I work

31:50.865 --> 31:53.266
for the DEA,
which controls the licensing

31:53.268 --> 31:54.567
of doctors to prescribe

31:54.569 --> 31:56.035
controlled substances.

31:56.037 --> 31:59.505
And as of now this hospital
is under federal investigation.

31:59.507 --> 32:01.507
You really think
that blaming doctors

32:01.509 --> 32:04.410
for the opioid epidemic
is gonna solve the crisis?

32:04.412 --> 32:08.047
No... but it's a start.

32:29.269 --> 32:30.770
Hey.

32:32.040 --> 32:34.674
You want to
keep it down?

32:37.211 --> 32:38.911
Welcome back.

32:38.913 --> 32:40.446
What happened?

32:40.448 --> 32:44.784
You, uh, had
an accidental O.D.

32:44.786 --> 32:47.787
And you scared
the hell out of me.

32:47.789 --> 32:49.288
How long was I out?

32:49.290 --> 32:52.325
Almost a week.

32:52.327 --> 32:54.627
You look like hell.

32:54.629 --> 32:56.362
You been here
every night?

32:56.364 --> 32:57.630
Yeah.

32:57.632 --> 32:59.799
I'm okay.

32:59.801 --> 33:01.234
Go home.

33:01.236 --> 33:03.135
To your boys.

33:03.137 --> 33:05.972
The boys are with my old man.
They're fine.

33:05.974 --> 33:09.141
I'll walk out of here
when you do, okay?

33:09.143 --> 33:11.077
Yeah, okay.

33:12.713 --> 33:14.180
No more snoring.

33:30.931 --> 33:33.132
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Governor,

33:33.134 --> 33:35.434
but I'm afraid
we have a problem.

33:35.436 --> 33:39.405
We are picking up chatter
about potential terror activity

33:39.407 --> 33:42.008
at the Second Avenue Subway
event.

33:42.010 --> 33:43.543
How credible is the threat?

33:43.545 --> 33:45.177
We're working on that now.

33:45.179 --> 33:46.345
So what are you gonna do
about it?

33:46.347 --> 33:47.480
Under the circumstances,

33:47.482 --> 33:49.782
it might be wise
to cancel the event.

33:49.784 --> 33:53.119
No. I'm not letting these people
dictate my agenda.

33:53.121 --> 33:54.954
I want everything you've got
on this.

33:54.956 --> 33:56.822
Pardon the interruption...
Oh, sorry.

33:56.824 --> 33:59.125
You know my DCPI Garrett Moore.

33:59.127 --> 34:01.127
Governor.
- And Carlton Miller

34:01.129 --> 34:02.161
from the mayor's office.

34:02.163 --> 34:03.396
Guys, where are we on this?

34:03.398 --> 34:04.830
Governor, we need to talk.

34:04.832 --> 34:06.899
Governor, we have a
complicated situation here.

34:06.901 --> 34:08.167
I am pulling

34:08.168 --> 34:10.670
all my officers from the area.

34:10.672 --> 34:12.038
Why the hell would you do that?

34:12.040 --> 34:14.574
You just said
it was a credible threat.

34:14.576 --> 34:16.708
By pulling my officers,
it allows your officers

34:16.710 --> 34:19.210
to handle the threat
on their own,

34:19.213 --> 34:21.380
under your command.

34:21.382 --> 34:23.416
Without interference

34:23.418 --> 34:25.318
from the NYPD.

34:27.321 --> 34:29.388
I see you.

34:29.389 --> 34:32.224
Good.

34:32.226 --> 34:33.993
It is my job, Governor,

34:33.995 --> 34:36.728
to protect
law enforcement officers,

34:36.731 --> 34:38.030
yours and mine.

34:38.032 --> 34:40.166
Without command coordination,

34:40.168 --> 34:41.934
I can't do that.

34:41.936 --> 34:44.437
Fine.

34:44.438 --> 34:46.839
You want to play hardball?

34:46.841 --> 34:49.175
I can't tell you
where to put your people,

34:49.177 --> 34:52.043
but what I can do
is put you out on the street.

34:52.045 --> 34:54.647
You can fire me at your leisure,
but, right now,

34:54.649 --> 34:58.284
we have less than an hour
to come up with a game plan.

34:58.286 --> 35:00.720
What the hell do you want?

35:00.722 --> 35:04.190
That state police apprise
the NYPD

35:04.192 --> 35:07.927
of all future deployments
to this city

35:07.929 --> 35:11.163
and coordinate it
with this office.

35:11.165 --> 35:14.133
While remaining
under my control.

35:14.135 --> 35:15.501
Well...

35:15.503 --> 35:17.903
that's the law.

35:19.306 --> 35:20.573
And the ceremony?

35:20.575 --> 35:23.576
Full-court press
from the best cops in the world.

35:23.578 --> 35:25.645
Ours.

35:25.647 --> 35:27.546
Which the mayor also approves.

35:29.650 --> 35:32.051
Deal.

35:32.053 --> 35:34.387
But this ain't over.

35:43.397 --> 35:46.532
What happens if he finds out
there was no terrorist threat?

35:46.534 --> 35:49.869
Hey, I said "online chatter,"
which there always is.

35:49.871 --> 35:52.772
What threat level
that chatter raises...

35:52.774 --> 35:53.973
A known unknown.

35:53.975 --> 35:55.174
What happens when the mayor

35:55.176 --> 35:57.243
finds out she went toe-to-toe
with the governor?

35:57.245 --> 35:58.411
She'll take the victory.

35:58.413 --> 36:00.279
She had no appetite
for the battle.

36:00.281 --> 36:01.781
Not gonna come up.

36:01.783 --> 36:03.416
Why do you say that?
Because we won.

36:03.418 --> 36:07.820
And he has no appetite
for conceding a loss.

36:07.822 --> 36:10.489
This meeting, this whole
conflict never happened.

36:10.491 --> 36:13.359
As of the moment
he walked out that door.

36:13.361 --> 36:14.660
I bet you're right.

36:14.662 --> 36:16.529
Kind of gives me a chill.

36:17.397 --> 36:19.565
Me, too.

36:32.880 --> 36:35.081
How you handling
the withdrawals?

36:35.083 --> 36:36.415
Methadone helps.

36:36.417 --> 36:37.950
Definitely felt better.

36:37.952 --> 36:39.585
Well, we nailed the dealer

36:39.587 --> 36:42.388
who supplied you
and Dylan and Nigel.

36:42.390 --> 36:43.756
That's good to hear.

36:43.758 --> 36:46.726
You're not the first person to
get hooked on this junk, Peter.

36:48.695 --> 36:51.564
The school
fired me this morning.

36:53.133 --> 36:56.102
I'm sorry to hear that.

36:56.104 --> 36:59.772
Teaching's
all I ever wanted to do.

37:01.142 --> 37:02.842
It's all I had left.

37:02.844 --> 37:04.176
There's other schools.

37:04.178 --> 37:05.644
None of which
will hire me

37:05.646 --> 37:08.147
with a drug conviction
on my record.

37:08.149 --> 37:10.316
I don't blame 'em.

37:11.184 --> 37:13.686
Speaking of, uh,

37:13.688 --> 37:15.755
I did happen
to have a conversation

37:15.757 --> 37:17.757
with the prosecutor
assigned to your case,

37:17.759 --> 37:21.727
and I may or may not have told
her how helpful you were.

37:21.729 --> 37:24.864
Y-You-you didn't have
to do that.

37:24.866 --> 37:26.031
I know I didn't have to do it.

37:26.033 --> 37:27.466
Now stop feeling sorry
for yourself

37:27.468 --> 37:29.068
and listen for a second.

37:29.070 --> 37:31.737
You complete rehab--

37:31.739 --> 37:35.274
and I mean go in there
and get clean--

37:35.276 --> 37:38.644
she'll be willing to knock
the possession charge down

37:38.646 --> 37:40.780
to a violation,
which means you could walk away

37:40.782 --> 37:44.116
from this whole thing
without a record.

37:47.488 --> 37:49.221
I don't know what to say.

37:49.223 --> 37:50.956
Just say you're gonna get clean.

37:50.958 --> 37:53.459
I will.

37:53.461 --> 37:55.961
Thank you.

37:55.963 --> 37:58.297
Look, you're a good guy, Peter,

37:58.299 --> 38:00.966
but you got a bad problem.

38:00.968 --> 38:02.935
It's time to fix it.

38:12.445 --> 38:13.846
Hey.

38:13.848 --> 38:15.648
Hey. What are
you doing here?

38:15.650 --> 38:17.750
Uh, I came to check in
on the Kenneth Tripp case.

38:17.752 --> 38:18.818
On your day off?

38:18.820 --> 38:20.619
It's been on my mind.

38:20.621 --> 38:22.488
Well, we're
still investigating,

38:22.490 --> 38:25.357
but I'm not sure we have enough
to prosecute Ruiz.

38:25.359 --> 38:27.359
But Ruiz was the one
leading the charges

38:27.361 --> 38:28.794
against Tripp living
in that building.

38:28.796 --> 38:30.896
Which proves nothing,
as you know.

38:30.898 --> 38:33.399
Well, Ruiz admitted to putting
Tripp in the hospital.

38:33.401 --> 38:34.633
He's claiming self-defense.

38:34.635 --> 38:35.734
Right now,
I don't have enough

38:35.736 --> 38:38.103
to prove guilt beyond
a reasonable doubt.

38:38.105 --> 38:39.905
No jury's gonna buy
self-defense.

38:39.907 --> 38:41.207
Tripp's half his size.

38:41.209 --> 38:43.108
He's also a child molester.

38:43.110 --> 38:44.410
So he deserved what he got?

38:44.412 --> 38:45.411
I didn't say that.

38:45.413 --> 38:47.346
And you know
I don't believe that.

38:48.281 --> 38:52.518
Look, if Tripp testifies,

38:52.520 --> 38:54.520
his record
could come out in court.

38:54.522 --> 38:57.690
And if it does, the jury
will give Ruiz a pass.

38:57.692 --> 38:58.858
You can't say that for sure.

38:58.860 --> 39:00.025
They will see a dad

39:00.027 --> 39:02.261
defending his family
from a predator.

39:02.263 --> 39:04.964
Now, whether or not
his actions were justified,

39:04.966 --> 39:06.599
Ruiz will walk.

39:06.601 --> 39:09.568
Look, Tripp got released
from the hospital earlier this morning.

39:09.570 --> 39:12.471
I think that we should at least
go and speak with him first.

39:12.473 --> 39:16.375
The least we can do is
hear what he has to say.

39:22.415 --> 39:23.816
How are you feeling?

39:23.818 --> 39:25.417
I'll live.

39:25.419 --> 39:28.454
Which I'm sure will disappoint
some people.

39:28.456 --> 39:33.959
Mr. Ruiz claims that
you initiated the altercation.

39:33.961 --> 39:35.828
We came to hear your side.

39:35.830 --> 39:40.299
Whatever I say
isn't gonna matter.

39:42.569 --> 39:46.305
You're entitled to make
a statement, Mr. Tripp.

39:46.307 --> 39:47.973
I'd like to hear it.

39:49.142 --> 39:51.677
I left the building about...

39:51.679 --> 39:54.046
7:30.

39:54.048 --> 39:56.582
On my way
to my mother's apartment.

39:56.584 --> 39:58.884
Uh, I passed Mr. Ruiz

39:58.886 --> 40:01.020
on the sidewalk.

40:01.022 --> 40:03.155
He made a remark.

40:04.591 --> 40:05.524
What did he say?

40:05.526 --> 40:08.827
Uh, he said, uh...

40:08.829 --> 40:12.765
"Child rapists deserve to die."

40:14.367 --> 40:15.935
And what did you do?

40:15.937 --> 40:18.904
I said that, um,

40:18.906 --> 40:21.874
he had a right to hate me

40:21.876 --> 40:25.077
but that I wasn't gonna put up
with his threats.

40:25.079 --> 40:26.712
And did he stop?

40:26.714 --> 40:30.182
He called me an animal.

40:30.184 --> 40:32.351
And then what happened?
The truth.

40:32.353 --> 40:34.420
The truth is...

40:34.422 --> 40:36.789
the truth is...

40:38.825 --> 40:40.626
...I hit him.

40:41.695 --> 40:44.563
Why would you do that?
He could have killed you.

40:44.565 --> 40:46.999
I didn't get that lucky.

40:47.001 --> 40:51.437
Are-are you saying
that you wanted him to hurt you?

40:52.505 --> 40:56.041
I...

40:57.844 --> 41:01.013
I don't know.

41:01.015 --> 41:03.515
I just...

41:03.517 --> 41:08.220
just wanted
to stand up for myself.

41:09.789 --> 41:11.190
You could have come to us.

41:11.192 --> 41:15.127
Come on, we both... know better.

41:15.129 --> 41:17.329
I...

41:18.498 --> 41:20.866
I did my time.

41:20.868 --> 41:22.868
I'm still... guilty.

41:22.870 --> 41:25.004
I'm still the enemy.

41:28.541 --> 41:30.476
There's...

41:30.478 --> 41:33.812
there's no absolution

41:33.814 --> 41:36.348
for what I did.
