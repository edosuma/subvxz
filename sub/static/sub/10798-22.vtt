seek out warm-blooded beings

- To what end?

Unknown, sir.

It is conceivable there is
a symbiotic relationship involved.

09:05.711 --> 09:07.671
There are numerous animal remains
in the area,

that the vines could be predatory.

09:13.594 --> 09:17.138
Vines infect animals
in order to kill them?

09:17.598 --> 09:19.391
It is possible.

I hope my hypothesis is in error.

is that most life forms act

Armus has enveloped
Commander Riker.

38:16.460 --> 38:17.711
I'm beaming you up.

38:17.920 --> 38:21.548
ARMUS:
If any of you leave now, he dies.

38:21.757 --> 38:25.135
And so do the survivors
of the crash.

38:45.489 --> 38:48.742
The growth rate's down to 7 percent.

38:49.118 --> 38:52.120
The organisms are still impairing
his neural functions.

38:52.330 --> 38:55.915
Respiration's erratic, pulse grossly
irregular, blood pressure almost nil.

38:56.125 --> 38:57.959
Tricordrazine.

39:01.172 --> 39:03.757
Can we tighten the pattern further?

39:13.059 --> 39:16.394
COMPUTER:
Recognize Picard, Jean-Luc, captain.

39:16.604 --> 39:20.398
Recognize Riker, William T.,
commander.

39:21.609 --> 39:23.777
Set auto-destruct sequence.

39:23.986 --> 39:25.904
Does the first officer concur?

39:27.073 --> 39:30.700
Yes.
Set auto-destruct sequence now.

39:30.910 --> 39:35.705
Auto-destruct will detonate
in four minutes and 59 seconds.

39:39.960 --> 39:41.252
I am Korris.

39:41.462 --> 39:44.422
We'll handle the formalities later.
Right now we have to get off this ship.

39:44.632 --> 39:47.842
- Are there any other survivors?
- No.

39:50.471 --> 39:53.765
I believe I have found a quicker way
out of here, sir.

39:54.016 --> 39:55.058
Check him out.

39:58.813 --> 40:00.397
He is alive, sir, but just barely.

40:00.606 --> 40:02.482
Then pick up the body
and let's get out of here.

40:02.691 --> 40:03.775
No!

40:05.945 --> 40:09.114
- I will carry him.
- As you wish.

40:09.323 --> 40:11.408
Come on, let's go!

40:12.535 --> 40:15.495
Tasha, go to Transporter Room 3.

40:15.704 --> 40:17.664
I want you there
when the away team returns.

40:17.873 --> 40:19.457
Aye, sir.

40:28.968 --> 40:32.679
LA FORGE: Commander, we are
out of time. This ship is blowing!

40:33.556 --> 40:36.141
RIKER: Transporter Room,
have you got a lock on us?

40:36.350 --> 40:37.642
Too much interference.

40:37.852 --> 40:40.103
You have to get farther away
from the Engineering section.

40:40.312 --> 40:43.815
Sir, the Engineering section is critical.
Destruction of the Batris is imminent.

40:44.024 --> 40:45.817
They're out of options. Do it.

40:46.026 --> 40:47.485
Now.

41:02.084 --> 41:03.168
[EXPLOSIONS]

41:21.353 --> 41:23.521
The growth rate's
almost down to zero.

41:23.731 --> 41:26.107
That's not good enough.

41:39.997 --> 41:43.416
We seek peaceful coexistence.

41:47.755 --> 41:49.088
Set auto-destruct.

41:49.256 --> 41:50.840
[ALARM WAILING]

41:51.675 --> 41:53.426
Data, something's got me!

41:54.553 --> 41:56.554
Auto-destruct.

41:58.557 --> 42:07.607
Now.

42:09.693 --> 42:12.320
RIKER:
Data, something's got me!

42:56.323 --> 42:58.866
- Sickbay to Bridge.
PICARD: Yes, doctor?

42:59.076 --> 43:01.494
We've eradicated the infection.

43:01.704 --> 43:03.496
I'm on my way.

43:23.642 --> 43:25.018
You're still here?

43:25.769 --> 43:28.563
I could ask you the same question.

43:29.273 --> 43:30.732
How do you feel?

43:30.899 --> 43:32.066
[SIGHS]

43:32.234 --> 43:33.860
Beat.

43:34.403 --> 43:36.529
You wouldn't believe the dreams
I was having.

43:37.740 --> 43:39.365
Oh, yes, we would.

43:39.575 --> 43:43.411
You will be pleased to hear
that we've terminated the infection.

43:44.663 --> 43:46.080
Great work, doctor.

43:46.290 --> 43:49.584
Now, if I can get out of here,
I'd like to get back to--

43:49.793 --> 43:50.960
PULASKI:
Lie still.

43:51.170 --> 43:53.713
I still have a few dozen tests to run.

43:53.922 --> 43:55.298
RIKER:
Why? I feel fine.

43:55.507 --> 43:58.051
There may be
some residual memory loss.

43:58.260 --> 44:02.305
I just wanna be certain
that you still know who you are.

44:04.808 --> 44:06.893
Of course I know who I am.

44:07.102 --> 44:10.480
I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard
of the USS Enterprise.

44:12.107 --> 44:14.984
l'm delighted
that you're feeling better, captain.

44:15.194 --> 44:18.071
The admiral and I
were worried about you.

44:18.572 --> 44:21.199
Captain, I do not believe
you have the authority

44:21.408 --> 44:23.284
to promote me to the rank
of admiral.
