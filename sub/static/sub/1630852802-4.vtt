WEBVTT

00:00.333 --> 00:02.501
[women cheer]

00:02.503 --> 00:04.336
We're bringing some fun
in the sun.

00:04.338 --> 00:06.305
Whoo, party time!

00:06.307 --> 00:10.342
We're going to Miami because we
got accepted into Miami Swim Week.

00:10.344 --> 00:12.144
Can we see the runway walk?

00:13.146 --> 00:15.514
Oh, my God! Sexy!

00:17.217 --> 00:22.221
This could be a good time for you to
create some bonding time with the girls.

00:22.223 --> 00:25.257
Georgi doesn't make an effort
to bond with Aspen and Aniko.

00:25.259 --> 00:28.660
I think the future that he has
with Darcey is not as bright.

00:30.797 --> 00:32.998
- We have really good news.
<i>- What?</i>

00:33.000 --> 00:34.133
We're coming to Miami.

00:34.135 --> 00:35.734
<i>Yay!</i>

00:35.736 --> 00:37.936
Shannon, Darcey
and I are first cousins.

00:37.938 --> 00:39.938
She is an amazing mother,

00:39.940 --> 00:44.576
wife and entrepreneur and her
husband is a huge NBA player.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.245
They're like the ultimate
power couple.

00:46.247 --> 00:49.648
I know Darcey has a
tendency to compare her life

00:49.650 --> 00:51.617
to other people's
and it worries me

00:51.619 --> 00:53.919
that she's going to put
unnecessary pressure on herself

00:53.921 --> 00:55.821
when she sees Shannon's
perfect world.

00:57.824 --> 01:01.527
A friend of ours, Michael
Benz, he's going to be in Miami.

01:01.529 --> 01:05.197
It'd be great to connect with him
and have some business meetings.

01:05.199 --> 01:06.598
[Florian speaking]

01:07.567 --> 01:09.401
No.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.804
[Florian speaking]

01:11.806 --> 01:13.138
Don't be jealous.

01:13.140 --> 01:15.641
This is a business meeting,
it's not anything else than that.

01:18.711 --> 01:20.612
Miami, here we come, high five!

01:20.614 --> 01:22.548
[upbeat music]

01:24.284 --> 01:25.651
- We're back in Miami girl.
- Feels good.

01:25.653 --> 01:27.152
We're back in Miami.

01:27.154 --> 01:28.687
They have a pool.

01:28.689 --> 01:30.889
That's what I'm talking about.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.691
Being back in Miami
feels amazing,

01:32.693 --> 01:34.493
but there's a lot at risk

01:34.495 --> 01:38.063
and I don't want my daughters
to see me... fail.

01:38.065 --> 01:40.165
[upbeat music]

01:53.279 --> 01:55.481
[song playing]

02:05.658 --> 02:06.692
[Florian speaking]

02:06.694 --> 02:07.826
Breakfast.

02:07.828 --> 02:10.129
Hi, girls, you look beautiful.

02:10.131 --> 02:11.663
[Florian speaking]

02:11.665 --> 02:12.931
Pretty.

02:12.933 --> 02:15.200
- You guys ready for today?
- Yeah.

02:15.202 --> 02:17.569
- Nice.
- Oh, wow.

02:17.571 --> 02:19.404
Today's our first day
here in Miami,

02:19.406 --> 02:23.041
and Stacey and I have so much
to do before the fashion show.

02:23.043 --> 02:26.011
Our team doesn't arrive
from L.A. for a few days.

02:26.013 --> 02:28.614
So first, we're going to try
to squeeze in some family time

02:28.616 --> 02:30.816
before things get really crazy.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.718
Guys, want some fresh fruit?

02:32.720 --> 02:33.986
[Florian speaking]

02:33.988 --> 02:35.621
I don't think I've ever tried.

02:35.623 --> 02:36.989
[Florian speaking]

02:36.991 --> 02:39.758
- No, we don't.
- We usually buy it when we're in Connecticut.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.560
[Florian speaking]

02:41.562 --> 02:42.995
Yeah.

02:42.997 --> 02:44.062
[Florian speaking]

02:44.064 --> 02:46.498
[Georgi speaking]

02:54.440 --> 02:56.108
I'm excited to find out
what the surprise is.

02:56.110 --> 02:57.309
Yeah, me too.

02:57.311 --> 02:58.777
What do you think
the surprise is?

02:58.779 --> 03:00.112
[Florian speaking]

03:00.114 --> 03:01.747
We're going to adopt a dog.

03:03.049 --> 03:06.151
- [Florian speaking]
- Ah, that's a nice surprise.

03:06.153 --> 03:07.686
Is it a puppy, Georgi?

03:07.688 --> 03:10.722
I've been wanting a puppy
for six years.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.090
[Georgi speaking]

03:12.092 --> 03:13.325
Aww!

03:13.327 --> 03:14.560
Now, they're sad.

03:14.562 --> 03:17.029
- Oh, you guys want a puppy?
- It's okay.

03:17.031 --> 03:18.197
It's okay, girl.

03:18.199 --> 03:19.665
[Georgi speaking]

03:21.267 --> 03:23.669
[Aniko speaking]

03:26.172 --> 03:29.608
And we will even take the
chance to name the dog, Georgi,

03:29.610 --> 03:31.777
just because we're so grateful
for him and getting us a dog.

03:31.779 --> 03:33.145
No, it's weird.

03:34.914 --> 03:36.381
Where are you guys going?

03:36.383 --> 03:38.183
We're going to go explore Miami.

03:38.185 --> 03:39.918
Have a little fun in the sun.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.920
I thought you're going
to the beach in that outfit.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.155
Well, you never know.

03:43.157 --> 03:44.456
[Georgi speaking]

03:44.458 --> 03:45.991
Let's go, girls.

03:45.993 --> 03:47.359
- Bye, have fun.
- [Florian speaking]

03:47.361 --> 03:49.061
We'll be back, hopefully.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.130
[upbeat music]

04:01.441 --> 04:03.375
-Ah, feel that breeze?
-Mm-hmm. Very cold.

04:04.410 --> 04:06.411
[Georgi speaking]

04:06.413 --> 04:09.715
Woo, wow, look at this, guys.

04:09.717 --> 04:11.283
You know, this is so pretty.

04:12.585 --> 04:14.186
[Georgi speaking]

04:20.426 --> 04:22.127
[Aniko] So are we going on
like a boat ride?

04:22.129 --> 04:23.662
- What do we do?
- [Aspen] What's happening?

04:23.664 --> 04:25.364
[Darcey]
Take me to that big yacht.

04:25.366 --> 04:26.999
[Georgi speaking]

04:31.804 --> 04:35.040
- What?
- [Aniko speaking]

04:35.042 --> 04:36.375
- [Georgi speaking]
- Deep water oceans.

04:36.377 --> 04:37.676
I actually love that.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.511
Ahem, I'm scared of fish.

04:40.546 --> 04:42.614
- I love to fish.
- I don't.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.917
Fish occasionally during
the summertime, especially.

04:45.919 --> 04:47.552
We, we've had some memories.

04:47.554 --> 04:50.022
Yeah, some near-death
experiences.

04:51.090 --> 04:52.824
- So, fishing.
- She's OD.

04:52.826 --> 04:56.128
- She's overdramatic.
- No. Near death twice, two times.

04:56.130 --> 05:00.399
I threw a fish at her face, a
dead fish, which was in a bag.

05:00.401 --> 05:03.835
I almost sunk
in the freaking river.

05:03.837 --> 05:06.238
That wasn't when
we were fishing, no.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.373
I mean, honestly, like what?

05:08.375 --> 05:12.210
What made you think
we would like fishing?

05:12.212 --> 05:14.813
[Georgi speaking]

05:19.018 --> 05:21.320
- There's so many other alternatives.
- Yeah.

05:21.322 --> 05:25.590
Fishing is not really
like my cup of tea.

05:25.592 --> 05:30.329
It's a little slimy, like you have to
touch worms and like touch the scales

05:30.331 --> 05:34.299
and the smell
and I don't even eat fish.

05:34.301 --> 05:36.401
Don't like fish. It's fishy.

05:36.403 --> 05:38.970
Like, I'm on this side.
I'm coming over here.

05:38.972 --> 05:40.439
I want to go deep fishing.

05:40.441 --> 05:41.907
Oh, that's man.

05:41.909 --> 05:43.542
[Georgi speaking]

05:45.445 --> 05:47.612
Yeah, exactly and I
might catch a bigger fish.

05:47.614 --> 05:50.182
- No, I can't get you a fish at all.
- Hey, I'm single.

05:51.484 --> 05:53.919
[Aspen] Mama, that's so rude.

05:53.921 --> 05:56.521
[Georgi speaking]

06:10.336 --> 06:12.938
We're just sitting
at some side and just enjoy.

06:12.940 --> 06:14.740
[Aspen] Everyone's going to be
so jealous.

06:16.442 --> 06:18.810
<i>[Darcey] It's not the best
surprise in the world for me,</i>

06:18.812 --> 06:22.781
and I'm not quite sure
how Georgi's paying for this

06:24.283 --> 06:26.985
because I have a funny feeling
putting it on his credit card.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.387
But you know what?

06:28.389 --> 06:30.489
I have to make the best out
of it for me and my daughters.

06:31.591 --> 06:32.824
Where is it, Georgi?

06:32.826 --> 06:34.025
[Georgi speaking]

06:35.661 --> 06:37.229
<i>[Aniko] Oh, my God, that?</i>

06:38.297 --> 06:40.232
<i>- [Darcey] Is it our boat?
- [Georgi speaking]</i>

06:40.234 --> 06:41.600
<i>[Darcey] Jesus Lord.</i>

06:43.002 --> 06:46.104
- So the paint is chipping.
- Chipping.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.539
- It's rusting.
- Smells.

06:47.541 --> 06:48.774
Something worms.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.544
[man 1] Watch your step dear.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.212
Kiss the dock goodbye.

06:54.214 --> 06:56.214
[Aniko] There's lot of a fish.

06:56.216 --> 06:57.682
- [man 1] Watch your step.
- [Darcey] Oh, oh.

06:57.684 --> 06:58.683
[man 1] Watch your step.

06:58.685 --> 07:00.986
Oh, my goodness.
High heels on a fishing boat.

07:00.988 --> 07:02.521
- Yep.
- [man 1] She brought some roller skates.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.356
[Darcey] Thank you.
Okay, all right.

07:04.358 --> 07:07.893
I have clothes for every
occasion and I mean,

07:07.895 --> 07:11.062
if Georgi had told me that he
was going to take us fishing,

07:11.064 --> 07:13.598
I would have been fishing,
fashioned ready shorts,

07:13.600 --> 07:16.935
cool flip flops and cool
sunglasses and the hat.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.537
You know, I would
have been ready to go.

07:18.539 --> 07:21.406
I mean, I wouldn't have
fished, but I would look cute.

07:23.042 --> 07:24.509
Here we go.
[horn sound]

07:26.345 --> 07:28.013
Whoo!

07:30.616 --> 07:33.185
Oh, that was supposed
to be our boat, Aniko.

07:38.324 --> 07:39.624
[man speaking on radio]

07:42.161 --> 07:43.662
Oh!

07:45.264 --> 07:46.665
[Darcey] Oh.

07:47.667 --> 07:49.668
I'm a little nauseous.

07:51.704 --> 07:54.206
[screaming and laughing]

07:59.245 --> 08:01.346
Yeah, maybe heels were
a bad idea.

08:01.348 --> 08:03.181
- How are you feeling, mom?
- I don't know.

08:03.183 --> 08:04.549
Mommy, just get up.

08:04.551 --> 08:06.952
- I can't.
- You can.

08:06.954 --> 08:08.286
You're fine.

08:08.288 --> 08:09.888
Okay, I got it. I got it.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.790
I'm like a pro when it comes
to wearing high heels.

08:11.792 --> 08:14.426
I can walk like
a balance beam, tight rope,

08:14.428 --> 08:16.628
but apparently not on
a fishing boat.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.230
You want to take off the shoes?

08:18.232 --> 08:20.365
You maybe,
you'll be more stable.

08:20.367 --> 08:22.534
Georgi, Georgi.

08:22.536 --> 08:24.970
It's just not my thing.
Oh, my God.

08:26.138 --> 08:27.906
Dirty ass boat.

08:27.908 --> 08:30.542
[song playing]

08:37.583 --> 08:38.783
[Stacey] You like Miami?

08:38.785 --> 08:40.185
[Florian speaking]

08:46.259 --> 08:49.628
Yeah, it's like city,
beach, tropical.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.329
[Florian speaking]

08:51.331 --> 08:52.831
This is Florian's
first time in Florida,

08:52.833 --> 08:54.900
and I want to show him
a good time.

08:54.902 --> 08:56.234
Miami is vibrant.

08:56.236 --> 08:58.870
It's so exciting.
It's beautiful.

08:58.872 --> 09:01.606
<i>Oh, it's so beautiful here.</i>

09:01.608 --> 09:04.075
Oh, I don't know, I mean, you
see us getting married here?

09:04.077 --> 09:05.176
I can.

09:05.178 --> 09:06.578
[Florian speaking]

09:09.248 --> 09:12.951
Yeah, I mean, I know what you're
saying. I know what you're saying.

09:12.953 --> 09:17.322
I get it, but I feel like just I
do see it here. Don't you?

09:20.626 --> 09:22.594
Wouldn't it be amazing
to get married by the ocean?

09:22.596 --> 09:24.162
[Florian speaking]

09:32.071 --> 09:34.906
I just feel like this is the
perfect destination for us

09:34.908 --> 09:36.274
to have our dream wedding.

09:36.276 --> 09:39.945
I know you just got here and
you want to give it a little time.

09:39.947 --> 09:41.446
That's fair.

09:41.448 --> 09:43.048
Just, you know, think about it

09:43.050 --> 09:46.585
because it could be a great
transition for us to move here.

09:46.587 --> 09:48.687
[Florian] Mm-hmm.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.088
[Florian speaking]

09:50.090 --> 09:52.357
Just, just be more open.

09:52.359 --> 09:54.526
I know it's new,

09:54.528 --> 09:58.663
but it's, I don't know, feel like
it'd be a good change for us

09:58.665 --> 09:59.864
to start fresh.

09:59.866 --> 10:01.032
[Florian speaking]

10:02.835 --> 10:04.703
- So you know what I did for us.
- Mm-hmm?

10:04.705 --> 10:07.339
I booked us something special
and fun to do.

10:07.341 --> 10:08.974
- [Florian speaking]
- Salsa dancing.

10:08.976 --> 10:10.475
- [Florian speaking]
- Yeah, are you ready?

10:10.477 --> 10:11.977
[Florian speaking]

10:13.546 --> 10:15.180
But we're in Miami and why not,

10:15.182 --> 10:17.315
you know, people do salsa
in the streets.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.854
I'm just wanting to do something
fun, something different,

10:22.856 --> 10:25.390
and if we get married here
in Miami,

10:25.392 --> 10:27.225
you know, maybe we can have
some salsa dancers

10:27.227 --> 10:28.893
and because we
have to do a dance.

10:28.895 --> 10:30.428
[Florian speaking]

10:30.430 --> 10:32.797
Well, then we'll do Albanian
dancing for the wedding.

10:32.799 --> 10:35.100
- [Florian speaking] - Have
Albanian, traditional Albanian dancers.

10:35.102 --> 10:37.068
[Stacey speaking]

10:37.070 --> 10:39.004
- [Florian speaking]
- Yeah.

10:43.909 --> 10:46.144
[Florian speaking]

10:48.914 --> 10:50.048
[Stacey] I think I see them.

10:50.050 --> 10:53.652
Ooh, wow, I hope
I can move like that.

10:53.654 --> 10:56.054
Might be a little hard after
having surgery, though.

11:00.926 --> 11:04.562
Yay. Never had salsa lessons
before, so this is our first try.

11:04.564 --> 11:05.897
- [Juinier] Come on.
- Ready?

11:05.899 --> 11:07.832
Just put my bag down.

11:07.834 --> 11:10.802
Salsa dancing is a little bit of
everything. It comes from Cuba.

11:10.804 --> 11:14.439
It went all over the world,
Colombia, Puerto Rico, New York.

11:14.441 --> 11:17.375
Everybody in Miami like they
know at least a little bit of salsa,

11:17.377 --> 11:19.411
so we love teaching
everybody our style

11:19.413 --> 11:22.380
and for them to find their own
style when they dance as well.

11:22.382 --> 11:23.782
- Forward and back.
- Okay.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.350
You got to do what he does.
You got to copy.

11:25.352 --> 11:28.787
- [Florian speaking]
- And ah, ahm, ah.

11:28.789 --> 11:31.156
See, right?

11:31.158 --> 11:32.557
So three steps at a time.

11:34.026 --> 11:35.326
[Stacey] Stepping on
each other's toes.

11:35.328 --> 11:36.494
[Florian speaking]

11:36.496 --> 11:37.629
[Juinier] No.

11:37.631 --> 11:39.531
[Sol] One, two, three.

11:39.533 --> 11:43.301
Five, six, seven
and one, two, three.

11:43.303 --> 11:45.103
Five, six, seven.

11:45.105 --> 11:46.171
One, two, three.

11:46.173 --> 11:47.706
We're doing okay.
Oh, babe.

11:51.010 --> 11:53.144
The footwork
is a little difficult.

11:53.146 --> 11:55.180
[Juinier] Oh, I'm, one more
time, forward and back.

11:55.182 --> 11:56.514
[Florian speaking]

11:56.516 --> 11:59.284
Ow, babe. Ow!

11:59.286 --> 12:00.885
Okay, okay.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.253
[Florian speaking]

12:04.790 --> 12:06.491
[Juinier] A.
[Sol] One, two, three.

12:06.493 --> 12:07.959
- One, two, three.
- [Juinier] Three sets.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.029
I like the hip action.

12:11.031 --> 12:12.464
- [Juinier] Yes.
- Hmm.

12:12.466 --> 12:13.832
[Juinier laughs]

12:13.834 --> 12:15.300
[Juinier] Switch partners.

12:15.302 --> 12:17.035
- Switch partners?
- [Florian speaking]

12:17.037 --> 12:18.937
We got to switch partners, babe.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.405
It's okay.

12:20.407 --> 12:23.007
- It's okay.
- [Florian speaking]

12:23.009 --> 12:24.242
- Well.
- All right.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.978
- I just want to get the steps right.
- [Florian speaking]

12:28.080 --> 12:30.615
- All right.
- [Juinier] One, two, three.

12:32.017 --> 12:33.485
[producer speaking]

12:34.653 --> 12:36.287
[Florian speaking]

12:37.456 --> 12:38.923
So nobody else
can dance with me?

12:38.925 --> 12:40.125
Ever?

12:40.127 --> 12:42.160
[Florian speaking]

12:43.963 --> 12:45.230
I'm not in jail.

12:45.232 --> 12:46.631
[Florian speaking]

12:47.600 --> 12:49.334
[Stacey] Wow.

12:49.336 --> 12:52.637
Can't be jealous over me wanting
to learn from a professional dancer.

12:52.639 --> 12:53.671
[Florian speaking]

12:53.673 --> 12:55.573
Okay, all right.

12:55.575 --> 12:57.609
Okay, can we play some music?
We can do it?

12:57.611 --> 12:58.910
- Yeah, yeah.
- [Juinier] Okay.

12:58.912 --> 13:00.478
Yeah.

13:01.680 --> 13:03.314
[Florian speaking]

13:05.618 --> 13:07.519
Okay. Relax,
relax, relax, relax.

13:08.587 --> 13:10.321
Florian's always been jealous.

13:10.323 --> 13:14.292
I mean, come on, I secretly
love that, you know, he's into me,

13:14.294 --> 13:18.163
but this is out of control and he
needs to lighten up and chill out.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.064
Thank you.
Great job, everybody.

13:22.168 --> 13:23.635
Wanna come again?

13:23.637 --> 13:26.471
[Florian speaking]

13:26.473 --> 13:30.008
So, Georgi, now that we're trapped
on this boat in the middle of the ocean,

13:30.010 --> 13:33.044
are you in it for love or,

13:33.046 --> 13:36.047
or are you in it for the money?

13:36.049 --> 13:38.316
My mom got taken advantage
of so many times

13:38.318 --> 13:39.551
and it's not going
to happen again.

13:39.553 --> 13:40.819
Not on my watch.

13:43.022 --> 13:45.056
I hope you're not mad,
before we go to Shannon's.

13:45.058 --> 13:46.491
Why would I be mad?

13:46.493 --> 13:49.694
You know, I kind of told her that
you guys were not engaged anymore,

13:49.696 --> 13:52.063
and I didn't even think Georgi
was coming to Miami.

13:53.532 --> 13:55.433
Now, there might be judgment.

13:55.435 --> 13:58.136
I hope this doesn't make
things awkward for us today.

13:58.138 --> 13:59.571
Oh, boy.

14:01.640 --> 14:03.174
[upbeat music]

14:08.347 --> 14:10.381
[man 1 speaking on radio]

14:11.917 --> 14:14.052
[Darcey] Aspen, wait for mommy.

14:14.054 --> 14:15.620
[man 3] Pull like that.

14:15.622 --> 14:17.822
- You know, let this out like this.
- Okay.

14:17.824 --> 14:19.490
[man 3] And hold
and wait for a bait.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.092
[Aspen] I'm so excited.

14:22.394 --> 14:24.495
[Georgi speaking]

14:59.231 --> 15:02.634
I'm surprised that Aniko
is doing this right now.

15:02.636 --> 15:06.905
I just wanted to end like my unlucky
streak of bad fishing experiences,

15:06.907 --> 15:10.308
and not a lot of people can say
they were fishing in Miami, so.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.143
[Georgi speaking]

15:12.145 --> 15:13.444
[Aniko] Right.

15:13.446 --> 15:15.280
[Aspen] Got it. Got one.

15:15.282 --> 15:16.547
Did you catch one?

15:16.549 --> 15:18.116
[Aspen] I had a nice bite.

15:18.118 --> 15:20.285
Real nice bite.

15:20.287 --> 15:22.387
[Aniko] I thought I had
one for a second, too.

15:24.023 --> 15:27.392
We do appreciate Georgi
taking us on this family bonding,

15:27.394 --> 15:29.093
you know, adventure today,

15:29.095 --> 15:32.797
but I've had my questions about
Georgi's intentions with my mom

15:32.799 --> 15:36.000
because we're worried that
my mom's going to get hurt again

15:36.002 --> 15:37.669
if he's in it for money.

15:37.671 --> 15:40.672
Like my mom has never told
us. It's just things that we see.

15:40.674 --> 15:42.607
It's like my mom paying
every time.

15:42.609 --> 15:43.775
Every time.

15:44.877 --> 15:46.577
My mom felt taken advantage
of so many times

15:46.579 --> 15:49.314
and it's not going to happen
again, not on my watch.

15:50.983 --> 15:54.385
So, Georgi, now that we're trapped
on this boat in the middle of the ocean,

15:54.387 --> 15:58.723
I think it's right of me to interrogate
you on a few things. Okay.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.291
[Georgi speaking]

16:00.293 --> 16:03.494
So are you in it for love or,

16:03.496 --> 16:05.196
or are you in it for the money?

16:10.502 --> 16:12.603
Because in her
last relationships,

16:12.605 --> 16:16.374
they were in it for clout
or money,

16:16.376 --> 16:19.811
and we had experienced that, and we just
don't want it to happen again, you know.

16:22.581 --> 16:24.549
Like we've been through
for years and years,

16:24.551 --> 16:26.084
and we just want
the streak to end.

16:29.788 --> 16:31.422
[Georgi speaking]

16:45.270 --> 16:46.904
Okay.

16:46.906 --> 16:51.075
So what would you want to work
as to help support my mom?

16:53.946 --> 16:55.646
[Georgi speaking]

17:02.488 --> 17:05.189
- Okay.
- [Georgi speaking]

17:08.360 --> 17:09.560
Nice.

17:09.562 --> 17:13.064
[Georgi speaking]

17:32.284 --> 17:34.185
Like my mom's the most
important person in my life,

17:34.187 --> 17:36.387
but I just don't want to see
her hurt again, you know.

17:37.923 --> 17:41.626
And I really hope that doesn't
happen with you too, so.

17:41.628 --> 17:43.227
[Georgi speaking]

17:47.166 --> 17:49.934
Yeah, she deserves that.

17:49.936 --> 17:53.037
I'm really proud of my daughters
that they're able to open up

17:53.039 --> 17:56.107
to Georgi and just really
say whatever they're feeling

17:56.109 --> 17:58.242
and be able to ask
tough questions.

17:58.244 --> 18:03.314
I absolutely appreciate Aniko and
Aspen for, you know, protecting me,

18:03.316 --> 18:06.017
and I love them dearly for that.

18:06.019 --> 18:08.119
[Georgi speaking] [Aniko]
Yep. [Georgi speaking]

18:11.623 --> 18:15.226
[Aspen] My mom, she, she can be a lot
at sometimes, but at the end of the day,

18:15.228 --> 18:18.062
she, she will love
a person so much

18:18.064 --> 18:19.764
and she'll always
put them first.

18:21.266 --> 18:23.334
Georgi is really making
an effort

18:23.336 --> 18:26.370
and it's a step in
the right direction,

18:26.372 --> 18:31.609
but I need to see him
take more action financially

18:31.611 --> 18:35.913
and have a plan
so I can understand

18:35.915 --> 18:40.151
if he's truly ready to take this
relationship to another level

18:40.153 --> 18:43.254
where we share the
responsibilities together as a couple.

18:45.357 --> 18:47.158
Yeah, I didn't catch anything.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.392
[Georgi speaking]

18:48.394 --> 18:50.294
[Darcey] At least
you guys tried.

18:52.965 --> 18:56.267
[instrumental music]

19:01.807 --> 19:04.308
- How I look?
- [Florian speaking]

19:04.310 --> 19:06.110
- Yeah.
- [Florian speaking]

19:06.112 --> 19:08.412
Let me give you a kiss
because you look so cute.

19:10.015 --> 19:11.215
[Florian speaking]

19:11.217 --> 19:12.550
What are you guys up to?

19:12.552 --> 19:15.286
- Ooh, getting sexy...?
- Wow!

19:15.288 --> 19:19.423
I was going to wear that while you
went up to me in the fashion game, huh?

19:19.425 --> 19:20.691
Don't cut my style.

19:20.693 --> 19:21.792
It's okay.
Twinning is winning.

19:21.794 --> 19:22.994
Twinning is winning. I know.

19:22.996 --> 19:24.128
That's right.

19:24.130 --> 19:25.363
Well, you look beautiful, Stace.

19:25.365 --> 19:26.631
- [Stacey] Thank you.
- Very colorful.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.332
Well, I'm excited
to see Shannon aren't you?

19:28.334 --> 19:29.534
I am. I can't wait.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.169
I know.

19:31.171 --> 19:35.506
Shannon is our first cousin, my dad
and her mom are brother and sister

19:35.508 --> 19:40.111
and her husband, Ray Allen,
is a famous NBA player.

19:40.113 --> 19:43.014
And she's inspiring
to be around.

19:43.016 --> 19:44.649
And we love her so much.

19:44.651 --> 19:48.819
It was always so fun to go to her
house because our dad traveled a lot.

19:48.821 --> 19:50.354
You know, he was always
out of the country

19:50.356 --> 19:52.490
and, you know,
our parents were divorced

19:52.492 --> 19:53.891
and her parents
are still married.

19:53.893 --> 19:59.130
So, you know, we felt always
like a sense of home and just love,

19:59.132 --> 20:03.134
you know, and it was just memories
that we all can cherish forever.

20:03.136 --> 20:04.802
I'm really happy for you guys
to be able to go,

20:04.804 --> 20:07.538
and I feel like
just being around family

20:07.540 --> 20:09.006
is the most important thing.

20:10.576 --> 20:12.810
Darcey, there's kind of
something that I wanted to tell you.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.779
I hope you're not mad
or get upset.

20:14.781 --> 20:17.348
I just want to kind of get
out of the...

20:17.350 --> 20:18.950
When we go to Shannon's.
Why would I be mad?

20:18.952 --> 20:22.486
No, I talked to Shannon the other
day, Florian and I, on a video chat.

20:22.488 --> 20:26.691
You know, I kind of told her that
you guys were not engaged anymore,

20:26.693 --> 20:28.993
and I didn't even think Georgi
was coming to Miami.

20:32.197 --> 20:33.931
Why would you tell her that?

20:33.933 --> 20:36.167
You know, you were living at
dad's, usually up the apartment,

20:36.169 --> 20:38.836
you guys were officially
not engaged anymore.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.304
Oh, boy.

20:40.306 --> 20:43.074
And I felt like I didn't really want
to bring that negative energy.

20:43.076 --> 20:47.011
Oh, I don't want her to feel uncomfortable
now that he's going to be here.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.512
She was cool.
She's not uncomfortable.

20:48.514 --> 20:50.781
- [Darcey] I know that, I know.
- She wants the best for us both.

20:50.783 --> 20:54.719
Of course, Stacey, I'm just saying,
let me have that opportunity to say it.

20:54.721 --> 20:57.021
- I feel like.
- You don't have to talk for me.

20:58.490 --> 21:01.792
I wish Stacey didn't say anything
to Shannon about Georgi and I

21:01.794 --> 21:05.129
because now
there might be judgment.

21:05.131 --> 21:07.265
And I feel like
that's just not fair.

21:07.267 --> 21:11.269
We're in a better place now,
and I just want to move forward.

21:11.271 --> 21:15.573
So I hope this doesn't make things
awkward for us today and create drama

21:15.575 --> 21:17.642
where there's no
drama necessary.

21:17.644 --> 21:20.111
You guys have been up and down
and every day is like a different day.

21:20.113 --> 21:22.146
- So I just never know.
- Well, we are working on that.

21:22.148 --> 21:25.216
It's like you guys work on your
stuff, we're working on our stuff.

21:25.218 --> 21:27.652
So let's just, let it go.

21:27.654 --> 21:29.253
Ah, boy.

21:31.857 --> 21:34.558
Our friend, Mike Benz, he's
from L.A. He's in fashion as well.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.894
[Stacey] He takes us under his
wing. And we just go, we go forward.

21:36.896 --> 21:39.297
We're in fast mode
whenever we're around him.

21:39.299 --> 21:41.265
- He's Mr. Miami.
- [Stacey] That's cool.

21:44.036 --> 21:45.369
[Florian speaking]
[upbeat music]

21:54.646 --> 21:56.981
Let's go to Shannon's. Whoo!

21:56.983 --> 21:58.582
Cousin time!

21:58.584 --> 22:00.384
Hello girls.

22:03.588 --> 22:05.990
- Look, all these palm trees.
- Wow!

22:05.992 --> 22:08.793
- I like this neighborhood already.
- I know.

22:08.795 --> 22:10.027
Look at this.

22:10.029 --> 22:11.562
Clearly feels like
a jungle kinda.

22:11.564 --> 22:12.797
Yeah.

22:12.799 --> 22:15.966
Very private, exclusive, lavish.

22:15.968 --> 22:17.635
We're on our way to Shannon's.

22:17.637 --> 22:19.804
We're driving there
and going through,

22:19.806 --> 22:23.207
this neighborhood
is absolutely breathtaking.

22:23.209 --> 22:26.143
I mean, this is how
I see my vision board.

22:26.145 --> 22:27.978
Oh, it looks like we're going
to paradise to me.

22:27.980 --> 22:29.113
Mm-hmm.

22:29.115 --> 22:31.682
[Darcey] They're like
multi-million dollar homes.

22:31.684 --> 22:36.120
It just feels so lush
and exotic and picturesque.

22:36.122 --> 22:39.090
Ready girl,
you ready for this life?

22:39.092 --> 22:40.458
Oh, my God!

22:40.460 --> 22:43.060
One day, Aniko and Aspen.
Trust me.

22:44.062 --> 22:45.129
[Stacey] We're here.

22:45.131 --> 22:46.397
[Darcey] We're here, yeah.
[all] Yay!

22:46.399 --> 22:47.965
- [Stacey] We made it.
- [Aspen] Oh, my God.

22:47.967 --> 22:51.035
- Ahh, this is beautiful.
- [Darcey] Here we come guys.

22:51.037 --> 22:53.304
- Ready to see Shannon and your cousin?
- Cousin time.

22:55.941 --> 22:59.443
Auntie Shannon's house
is like this gorgeous house.

22:59.445 --> 23:03.481
It's like literally
my dream house.

23:05.617 --> 23:07.151
Hey, guys.

23:08.153 --> 23:09.353
Oh, my God!

23:14.259 --> 23:16.227
[Shannon] Georgi, what a
nice surprise. [Georgi speaking]

23:16.229 --> 23:18.329
What a nice surprise.
How are you?

23:18.331 --> 23:19.663
[Georgi speaking]

23:19.665 --> 23:22.400
[Shannon speaking]

23:22.402 --> 23:23.534
Come on in.

23:23.536 --> 23:25.669
I'm so grateful that Shannon

23:25.671 --> 23:29.507
is so welcoming to Georgi
and there's no questions

23:29.509 --> 23:32.009
as to why he's here
or what he did,

23:32.011 --> 23:35.713
all that stuff Stacey
had said, doesn't matter.

23:35.715 --> 23:38.949
And I so appreciate that,
so grateful for that.

23:38.951 --> 23:40.284
Boys?

23:40.286 --> 23:41.419
Coming.
[all cheering]

23:48.527 --> 23:50.995
He's so big.

23:50.997 --> 23:54.165
I feel like our cousins are like our
built-in, best friends and brothers,

23:54.167 --> 23:57.501
like we're all around the same
age and we're super-duper close.

23:57.503 --> 23:58.702
Mm-hmm.

23:58.704 --> 24:01.205
We always like play
video games or go outside,

24:01.207 --> 24:04.175
and it's just a really good
bonding experience for us.

24:04.177 --> 24:07.278
Just got so big,
so good to see you guys.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.379
Everyone's taller than me.

24:08.381 --> 24:09.914
[Darcey] Yeah, girls too.

24:09.916 --> 24:11.916
- I get it.
- Yeah, crazy.

24:11.918 --> 24:14.552
Well, I don't know how your trip
was, you guys, but I hope you're hungry

24:14.554 --> 24:16.954
because I have literally been
cooking for like eight hours.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.355
Oh, yeah.

24:18.357 --> 24:19.623
Let's go.

24:19.625 --> 24:21.292
[Stacey]
Your house is gorgeous.

24:21.294 --> 24:23.394
Wow, Shan!

24:23.396 --> 24:24.995
I know, family.

24:24.997 --> 24:27.465
[Georgi speaking]

24:27.467 --> 24:30.701
Shannon, she's a true success.

24:30.703 --> 24:33.137
She started
as a singer and actress

24:33.139 --> 24:35.105
and just started
her fast food restaurant.

24:35.107 --> 24:39.343
That's all organic,
so she and her husband, Ray,

24:39.345 --> 24:40.811
they're moguls
in their own right.

24:40.813 --> 24:44.782
And I really, really want that
driving success to rub off on Georgi.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.818
Oh, my God!

24:47.820 --> 24:49.386
[Shannon] I made some...
[indistinct]

24:49.388 --> 24:51.121
I made rice and beans.
This is chicken.

24:51.123 --> 24:54.358
I made shrimp, asparagus,
salad empanadas.

24:54.360 --> 24:57.595
-So I have plates. You guys just dig in.
-Thank you.

24:57.597 --> 25:00.631
Growing up in Connecticut with
Darcey and Stacey was all about family.

25:00.633 --> 25:01.999
It was really wonderful.

25:02.001 --> 25:04.301
Shan, this is amazing.
Wow.

25:04.303 --> 25:05.669
[Shannon] Good.
I'm so glad you like it.

25:05.671 --> 25:08.272
The twins and I are just
a month apart in age.

25:08.274 --> 25:10.808
We had our babies
around the same time.

25:10.810 --> 25:13.878
We started our careers
around the same time.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.980
And you know,
we're still super close.

25:15.982 --> 25:17.915
We don't see each other
all the time,

25:17.917 --> 25:20.618
but when we do,
it's like no time has passed.

25:20.620 --> 25:21.952
Oh, my God.

25:21.954 --> 25:24.054
Shrimp, so healthy, you
don't feel guilty after you eat it.

25:24.056 --> 25:26.390
Don't, you not feel guilty.

25:26.392 --> 25:28.592
We got a lot sucked out
in Turkey, but yeah.

25:30.328 --> 25:31.462
[Georgi speaking]

25:31.464 --> 25:33.063
- You love it?
- [Georgi speaking]

25:36.368 --> 25:38.002
- Thank you.
- [Georgi speaking]

25:43.642 --> 25:45.976
I'm so excited that Georgi
came to Miami.

25:45.978 --> 25:51.282
I didn't expect it, but I see Darcey
smiling, so that's a good thing.

25:52.317 --> 25:54.184
I want to hear
about this Turkey trip.

25:54.186 --> 25:55.486
Oh, my gosh.

25:55.488 --> 25:58.088
It was probably the best trip
Stace and I have ever been on.

25:58.090 --> 26:01.959
- It was something I'll never forget.
- Really?

26:01.961 --> 26:04.061
You know, you obviously
changed a little bit on the outside,

26:04.063 --> 26:07.598
but we felt like we had to go
on this journey and not just,

26:07.600 --> 26:12.002
you know, for the surgeries,
but, you know, inwardly.

26:12.004 --> 26:17.207
You know, to heal ourselves, to like
set us free from any past baggages

26:17.209 --> 26:22.246
and cut the cord on things that didn't
serve us anymore, and once we did that,

26:22.248 --> 26:24.081
I felt like a really big relief

26:24.083 --> 26:28.118
because we've a lot
of big things to do.

26:28.120 --> 26:30.321
- Yeah.
- And we're going to get there, Shan.

26:30.323 --> 26:32.323
Yes. Oh, Darcey.

26:32.325 --> 26:34.124
Oh, Shan.
[Shannon speaking]

26:36.995 --> 26:40.197
Shannon just knows
how to make big things happen.

26:40.199 --> 26:44.368
I guess I'm getting emotional because it seemed
the closest that she has with her husband

26:44.370 --> 26:48.639
and her children
and all of her success.

26:48.641 --> 26:54.578
And it makes me think about
my relationship in my life.

26:55.547 --> 26:56.880
That's where I want to be.

26:56.882 --> 27:02.319
And we're not there yet,
but I really have hope

27:02.321 --> 27:04.054
that we can make it happen.

27:06.057 --> 27:09.426
So while you guys were there,
did you have the inspiration to say,

27:09.428 --> 27:11.362
we want to do a fashion week?

27:11.364 --> 27:13.864
We were just feeling like we
wanted to expand our brand

27:13.866 --> 27:15.099
not only to clothing and winter,

27:15.101 --> 27:16.600
- swimwear and men's.
- [Stacey] Men's fashion.

27:16.602 --> 27:17.801
Now, we want to do men's.

27:17.803 --> 27:19.870
Men's is really like sparked
your interest in us.

27:19.872 --> 27:21.071
Our target has always
been women,

27:21.073 --> 27:23.073
but we want to inspire men
as well.

27:23.075 --> 27:27.611
This is huge to come out of Covid and
to be walking into Miami Swim Week.

27:27.613 --> 27:29.313
You guys are like a rose
out of concrete.

27:29.315 --> 27:30.481
Wow!

27:30.483 --> 27:32.316
- Thank you Shan.
- [Shannon] I love you.

27:32.318 --> 27:34.652
I love it.
I love it. I love it for you.

27:34.654 --> 27:36.120
Thank you.

27:36.122 --> 27:37.955
So while you're here, what
else do you guys have going on?

27:37.957 --> 27:39.423
There's never just one thing.

27:39.425 --> 27:41.125
No. There is some business
meeting set up.

27:41.127 --> 27:42.259
Tell me something about that.

27:42.261 --> 27:45.129
Our friend, Mike Benz,
he's from L.A.

27:45.131 --> 27:48.032
He's in fashion as well,
and he happens to be in Miami

27:48.034 --> 27:49.333
around the same time
for Fashion Week.

27:49.335 --> 27:52.436
So, you know, we're just going
to ban up with him again and--

27:52.438 --> 27:53.570
- Brainstorming.
- [Darcey] Brainstorm.

27:53.572 --> 27:55.939
[Shannon] Ideating.
Throwing ideas against the lot.

27:55.941 --> 27:59.243
-Yes. Yes.
-We love doing that with him. He's like... he's Cape Verdean.

27:59.245 --> 28:00.411
- What?
- Yes.

28:00.413 --> 28:01.512
Why you're leaving that out.

28:01.514 --> 28:03.347
[laughter]

28:03.349 --> 28:07.351
We guys, Stacey and I and Shan
were Cape Verdean.

28:07.353 --> 28:09.920
We're on the Cape Verde
Islands off the coast of West Africa.

28:09.922 --> 28:11.088
Yeah, we're mixed.

28:11.090 --> 28:12.389
It's a beautiful culture.

28:12.391 --> 28:15.159
Yeah and Michael
is Cape Verdean just like us,

28:15.161 --> 28:17.261
but he is also
a very savvy businessman.

28:17.263 --> 28:20.230
He's a DJ and a Fashion Designer,
who designs his own clothing.

28:20.232 --> 28:22.900
So we've always had that
instant connection with Michael

28:22.902 --> 28:24.101
since the first day we met him.

28:24.103 --> 28:25.369
I don't know.

28:25.371 --> 28:27.304
It's like, it's like Mike in
the middle, then the twins

28:27.306 --> 28:28.505
and we just like, own it.

28:28.507 --> 28:29.840
We're not scared.
We're not shy.

28:29.842 --> 28:31.075
[Stacey] He takes us
under his wing.

28:31.077 --> 28:32.476
[Darcey] And we just go,
we go forward.

28:32.478 --> 28:34.144
We're in fast mode
whenever we're around him.

28:34.146 --> 28:35.579
[Stacey] But he's
our protector too like.

28:35.581 --> 28:36.914
He know, make sure,
one good hand.

28:36.916 --> 28:38.849
He wants us to be seen
and get the clothes out there.

28:38.851 --> 28:40.084
[Stacey] He wants us
to be seeing...

28:40.086 --> 28:41.719
This guy's like an angel
for you, it sounds like.

28:41.721 --> 28:44.521
[Darcey] Yeah. He's Mr. Miami.

28:44.523 --> 28:45.989
[Stacey]
Look at Florian's face.

28:45.991 --> 28:47.424
Florian is like
he's got energy all right.

28:47.426 --> 28:49.093
[laughter]

28:50.695 --> 28:52.096
[Florian speaking]

29:01.639 --> 29:02.940
You're here at the right time.

29:02.942 --> 29:04.274
The stars are aligned

29:04.276 --> 29:05.909
and you have your angel
Michael in the middle.

29:05.911 --> 29:07.144
[Stacey] Yes.

29:07.146 --> 29:09.012
-[Shannon] So take full advantage of it.
-[Darcey] Yes.

29:10.849 --> 29:12.182
[Florian speaking]

29:12.184 --> 29:14.418
I'm going to the business
meeting to meet Michael.

29:14.420 --> 29:16.120
[Florian speaking]

29:16.122 --> 29:17.554
It's at a bar.

29:17.556 --> 29:19.823
[Florian speaking]

29:19.825 --> 29:22.159
Yeah, I'm going to be
in business meetings

29:22.161 --> 29:23.894
with a lot of people and men,

29:23.896 --> 29:27.097
so I'm not going to let
his jealousy get in the way.

29:27.099 --> 29:28.365
It's not a big deal.
[song playing]

29:42.547 --> 29:45.983
Oh, hey. You look good.

29:45.985 --> 29:47.284
Yeah, I feel fierce.

29:49.187 --> 29:52.589
I mean, Boss Babe mode, feeling
empowered and powerful in red.

29:52.591 --> 29:53.924
[Darcey] It's power color.

29:53.926 --> 29:57.461
- They look good, yeah.
- [Darcey] I'm ready for this meeting.

29:57.463 --> 30:01.131
Today, Stacey and I are going to go see
our good friend, Michael Benz, from L.A.

30:01.133 --> 30:02.633
He's a fashion designer.

30:02.635 --> 30:05.135
He's really well-connected
in the industry

30:05.137 --> 30:07.905
and he happens to be here in
Miami for Swim Week as well.

30:07.907 --> 30:09.973
So today we're going to have
a business meeting with him.

30:11.409 --> 30:12.909
A lot of work to do Georgi.

30:13.011 --> 30:16.446
I got a big fashion show to pull off
with Stacey and I'm ready to do it.

30:16.448 --> 30:18.816
That's what we came here for,
you know, before I left,

30:18.818 --> 30:21.318
my dad told me and Stacey,
"Work your butts off"

30:21.320 --> 30:25.289
because in life you wanna
manifest, you have to take action.

30:25.291 --> 30:27.291
- Yes boss.
- [Darcey] That's right.

30:27.293 --> 30:28.559
[Georgi speaking]

30:32.163 --> 30:34.531
Oh, that's so sweet.
Thank you.

30:34.533 --> 30:36.900
It would really mean a lot
for me to see you,

30:36.902 --> 30:39.570
you know, step dad mode
and bond with the girls

30:39.572 --> 30:44.675
because I want to be, you know,
with someone that's like my true partner.

30:46.110 --> 30:48.212
You know, I want to be
a power couple.

30:48.214 --> 30:49.646
I want us to be a power couple.

30:51.182 --> 30:53.317
I mean, look at Shannon and Ray.

30:53.319 --> 30:54.785
They're the ultimate
power couple.

30:54.787 --> 30:58.155
And that's beautiful.
That's the ultimate.

30:58.157 --> 30:59.990
All right.

30:59.992 --> 31:02.025
[Georgi speaking]

31:22.313 --> 31:24.581
Ah, yes. Spray me down.

31:26.251 --> 31:27.584
I love that perfume.

31:28.586 --> 31:31.788
I love perfume,
and I squirt it everywhere.

31:31.790 --> 31:33.657
I mean, there's not a spot
that I miss.

31:33.659 --> 31:36.360
Just, the boobs, okay.

31:36.362 --> 31:38.428
Head, shoulder,
knees and toes area.

31:38.430 --> 31:39.963
You want it to linger all day,

31:39.965 --> 31:41.398
especially
if you don't wash your hair.

31:41.400 --> 31:42.532
The kneecap.

31:42.534 --> 31:43.700
[Georgi speaking]

31:43.702 --> 31:46.003
- [Darcey] No, the kneecap.
- Oh.

31:46.005 --> 31:48.005
[producer speaking]

31:48.007 --> 31:50.841
Why not? You can
spray perfume anywhere.

31:50.843 --> 31:54.711
I mean, I wouldn't spray
it like in my goofy.

31:54.713 --> 31:56.480
Because that's going to burn.

31:56.482 --> 31:58.348
Ready to go. All right.

32:03.021 --> 32:04.354
Is this good?

32:04.356 --> 32:05.656
Where are you going?

32:05.658 --> 32:08.492
Going to the business meeting,
to meet Michael.

32:08.494 --> 32:10.327
[Florian speaking]

32:10.329 --> 32:12.462
It's at a bar.

32:12.464 --> 32:13.697
- [Florian speaking]
- [Stacey] Yeah.

32:14.899 --> 32:16.066
[Florian speaking]

32:17.101 --> 32:19.036
It's not a big deal.
We're in Miami.

32:19.038 --> 32:21.705
- [Florian speaking]
- [Stacey] Yeah, yeah.

32:23.174 --> 32:24.741
We agreed, and it's okay.

32:27.612 --> 32:30.681
I mean, I knew Florian
was jealous to a point,

32:30.683 --> 32:35.018
but it's getting very awkward
for me and I'm kind of like over it.

32:35.020 --> 32:36.954
You know, I'm going to be
in business meetings,

32:36.956 --> 32:40.157
networking
with a lot of people and men,

32:40.159 --> 32:43.060
so I'm not going to let
his jealousy get in the way.

32:44.128 --> 32:47.597
You're my wife, you know,
I understand it like.

32:47.599 --> 32:52.202
I know, baby, I am your wife and
you're my husband. And I love you.

32:52.204 --> 32:53.437
I love you, too.

32:56.975 --> 32:59.376
We have nothing
to worry about. Okay?

32:59.378 --> 33:00.777
- All right then.
- Love you.

33:03.348 --> 33:05.182
[Florian speaking]

33:07.085 --> 33:08.352
Oh, I got a curfew now?

33:08.354 --> 33:09.553
- [Florian speaking]
- Oh wow!

33:09.555 --> 33:10.721
[Florian speaking]

33:10.723 --> 33:12.956
[Florian speaking]

33:30.274 --> 33:31.475
I've got to get going.

33:34.412 --> 33:35.746
Everything's going to be fine.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.951
[Darcey] I'm going to take
baby steps with Georgi.

33:40.953 --> 33:42.152
We're finally meeting
in the middle.

33:42.154 --> 33:44.921
But there's the kicker
and a big one.

33:44.923 --> 33:47.224
He hasn't spent one dollar
since he's been in Connecticut.

33:47.226 --> 33:50.260
Cut him now. Cut him.

33:52.430 --> 33:54.131
[upbeat music]

34:04.976 --> 34:07.110
So this meeting
with Michael today

34:07.112 --> 34:08.478
isn't a typical
business meeting,

34:08.480 --> 34:09.880
but it's our kind of meeting

34:09.882 --> 34:12.582
because Michael's like family
to us, it's kind of like a brother,

34:12.584 --> 34:15.819
you know, he understands just
the way our brother understood us.

34:15.821 --> 34:17.020
Yeah.

34:17.022 --> 34:19.489
[Darcey] So we want to talk
to him about the fashion show

34:19.491 --> 34:22.526
and just shoot some ideas off
of him and kind of catch up again.

34:22.528 --> 34:24.227
Yeah.

34:24.229 --> 34:27.230
- [Darcey] There he is.
- [Stacey] There he is.

34:27.232 --> 34:29.166
O M Silva!

34:29.168 --> 34:31.301
[Stacey speaking]

34:31.303 --> 34:33.236
My sisters from another mother.

34:33.238 --> 34:36.940
- Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my gosh.

34:36.942 --> 34:38.608
Where the [beep] have you been?

34:38.610 --> 34:40.944
Oh, my gosh.

34:40.946 --> 34:43.947
You look so glamorous and
sparkly like I envisioned you.

34:43.949 --> 34:46.950
Oh, my gosh. What's going on?
Come, have a seat.

34:46.952 --> 34:49.186
<i>[Stacey] We met Michael
when we first went to L.A.</i>

34:49.188 --> 34:53.423
and he was in the who's who
of Hollywood.

34:53.425 --> 34:55.025
<i>[Darcey] Our company
was just starting up</i>

34:55.027 --> 34:57.427
<i>and Michael
put us out there visually.</i>

34:57.429 --> 35:02.032
He would network us, you know,
at events, parties, red carpets.

35:02.034 --> 35:04.935
I remember at that time we went
to Sports Illustrated Fashion Show

35:04.937 --> 35:06.570
and he said, "Get right
up there on the red carpet."

35:06.572 --> 35:07.838
We weren't even on the list.

35:07.840 --> 35:10.640
He went up to the peer people,
got us right up there,

35:10.642 --> 35:15.078
right in the front of the line with
all the press, and they went to town.

35:15.080 --> 35:16.313
[Stacey] Yeah.

35:16.315 --> 35:17.714
<i>[Darcey] We learned a lot
from him.</i>

35:17.716 --> 35:19.049
And he believes in us.

35:20.618 --> 35:22.619
Sexy twin vixens.
Yay!

35:22.621 --> 35:24.287
No, we just had
a transformation.

35:24.289 --> 35:25.722
- We went to Turkey.
- Yeah.

35:27.158 --> 35:30.460
You, I mean, anything
different or we look the same?

35:33.631 --> 35:36.967
Oh, you look more beautiful.

35:36.969 --> 35:39.302
Oh, thank you.

35:39.304 --> 35:40.637
So back in the day when me,

35:40.639 --> 35:42.706
Darcey and Stacey collaborated,

35:42.708 --> 35:44.407
we started with just swimsuits.

35:44.409 --> 35:46.476
We did samples
and things like that.

35:46.478 --> 35:49.112
It was a really good combination
between me and them

35:49.114 --> 35:52.849
because as a, as a male
designer and as a female designer,

35:52.851 --> 35:54.417
we have a great fusion together.

35:54.419 --> 35:57.320
So we see things differently and
they see things the way they want it

35:57.322 --> 35:58.488
and we just produce it together.

35:58.490 --> 35:59.723
It's great.

35:59.725 --> 36:01.892
-The last time we were here,
you remember -Oh, my gosh!

36:01.894 --> 36:03.193
The best night ever!

36:03.195 --> 36:05.495
Remember, we released
our song. You were DJing.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.597
- [Darcey] Yeah.
- Yeah, that's the vibes, man.

36:07.599 --> 36:09.132
The vibes.

36:09.134 --> 36:11.868
The last time we were here in Miami
was when we launched our song.

36:11.870 --> 36:13.904
- Yep, "Lock Your Number."
- It was "Lock Your Number."

36:13.906 --> 36:17.607
Lock, lock, lock it.
Lock my number in your phone.

36:17.609 --> 36:19.242
[song playing]

36:21.345 --> 36:23.647
Yeah, that was empowering song.

36:23.649 --> 36:25.315
It was. We actually
launched it during Swim Week.

36:25.317 --> 36:26.783
Yep.

36:26.785 --> 36:28.985
- That trip, everyone thought we were the Olsen Twins.
- [Stacey] Yes.

36:28.987 --> 36:31.521
People kept stopping us in the
street, wanting to take our picture.

36:31.523 --> 36:35.292
- Which one of you are Mary-Kate or Ashley?
- Yeah, crazy.

36:35.294 --> 36:36.493
So what are we doing, girls?

36:36.495 --> 36:39.162
Yeah, we got, you know,
a new swim collection.

36:39.164 --> 36:40.497
Actually a surprise too.

36:40.499 --> 36:41.965
- We expand it to men's.
- I love it.

36:41.967 --> 36:43.133
[Darcey]
We got women's, men's.

36:43.135 --> 36:44.901
- Yeah, we're going big baby.
- [Darcey] Yeah.

36:44.903 --> 36:46.636
- Oh, yeah. 100%.
- Yep.

36:46.638 --> 36:49.172
Okay, so what can I do for you?

36:49.174 --> 36:52.609
Anything you need in Miami,
you let me know.

36:52.611 --> 36:55.946
I mean, moral support
and the love is everything.

36:55.948 --> 36:58.848
And there's going to be a
casting call for the models. Okay.

36:58.850 --> 37:01.251
Well, if you need anything and
you need models, I can help you out.

37:01.253 --> 37:03.353
I think it'd be great. We're
going to be doing casting.

37:03.355 --> 37:06.256
I think, you know,
anything style wise,

37:06.258 --> 37:09.392
I think we love your taste
and your style, so it could help

37:09.394 --> 37:11.461
you know anything to add
a little flair.

37:11.463 --> 37:13.396
-I'm down. You know that.
-You know, we're going global.

37:13.398 --> 37:15.098
- [Michael] Exactly.
- We're going global baby.

37:15.100 --> 37:17.234
- [Darcey] You always inspired us.
- [Michael] Cheers to that.

37:17.236 --> 37:18.668
- Global.
- [Stacey] Global.

37:18.670 --> 37:21.404
- Going global baby.
- That's right.

37:21.406 --> 37:22.906
I'm so excited for you both.

37:22.908 --> 37:25.308
It's going to be like,
I already see it happening.

37:25.310 --> 37:27.510
Yeah, remember those days in
L.A. when we did the runway shows.

37:27.512 --> 37:28.645
Oh, yeah.

37:28.647 --> 37:29.980
- Remember?
- [Michael] Of course.

37:29.982 --> 37:31.681
- [Darcey] Yeah.
- I'm going to take you out like I used to.

37:31.683 --> 37:34.684
Come on, I'm married now.
Remember Florian?

37:34.686 --> 37:36.286
Your boy.
He's making you happy? Right?

37:36.288 --> 37:37.387
- Yes.
- Yes.

37:37.389 --> 37:38.588
He better be taking care of you,

37:38.590 --> 37:41.057
-because I see some [beep] and I was not happy.
-Yeah.

37:41.059 --> 37:42.225
- I know.
- [Michael] You know that.

37:42.227 --> 37:43.827
I know. I know.
That's, that's the past.

37:43.829 --> 37:47.130
You know me. You know
how much straight up, 100%.

37:47.132 --> 37:48.465
I've seen it with my own eyes.

37:48.467 --> 37:50.400
- I could vouch for that.
- Okay.

37:50.402 --> 37:52.302
<i>[Darcey] Michael's not going
to sugarcoat anything,</i>

37:52.304 --> 37:53.637
<i>and he's not going to judge us.</i>

37:53.639 --> 37:57.674
Stacey and I have a level
of trust and respect for him.

37:57.676 --> 38:01.444
And we know that he's going
to give brotherly type advice.

38:01.446 --> 38:03.546
- [Darcey] Yeah.
- Before I met Florian,

38:03.548 --> 38:05.615
he saw that I was
in an unhealthy relationship

38:05.617 --> 38:11.087
and, you know, he just helped me
get out of that, that toxic relationship.

38:11.089 --> 38:14.057
I'm glad that, you know,
Michael was always there for us.

38:14.059 --> 38:15.258
Yeah.

38:15.260 --> 38:18.228
- Okay, so who got some news.
- I got some news.

38:18.230 --> 38:20.964
- You know, I was engaged with Georgi.
- Yeah.

38:20.966 --> 38:22.832
But when Stacey and I
were in Turkey--

38:22.834 --> 38:24.167
- You ain't pregnant, are you?
- Oh, no.

38:24.169 --> 38:25.802
- No, no, no, no.
- Okay.

38:25.804 --> 38:27.304
[Darcey] But in a different,

38:27.306 --> 38:29.139
you know, headspace now
in a relationship,

38:29.141 --> 38:31.141
and I just felt like
I deserved more,

38:31.143 --> 38:34.811
and I decided
to kind of call things off

38:34.813 --> 38:37.514
because I just didn't feel like I
was being treated in the right way.

38:37.516 --> 38:38.682
Yeah.

38:38.684 --> 38:41.151
But now we're back together.

38:43.921 --> 38:45.488
You know,
no relationship is perfect,

38:45.490 --> 38:48.325
but I'm going to take
baby steps.

38:48.327 --> 38:51.161
We're taking it slow.
There's no rush.

38:51.163 --> 38:53.129
- Are you happy?
- [Darcey] I'm happy for myself.

38:53.131 --> 38:55.365
Is he, is he making you happy?

38:55.367 --> 38:57.500
He's making a lot of strides
and I had to like,

38:57.502 --> 39:00.403
let him know what I want and
need and he now he's listening.

39:01.706 --> 39:04.474
But there's a kicker
and a big one

39:04.476 --> 39:06.042
because she ain't telling
the whole truth.

39:06.044 --> 39:07.510
So that's it back for this one.

39:07.512 --> 39:09.446
He hasn't spent one dollar
since he's been in Connecticut.

39:09.448 --> 39:10.613
No.

39:13.284 --> 39:15.685
I have seen improvements
with Georgi,

39:15.687 --> 39:19.489
but I still don't see, you
know, what's the game plan?

39:19.491 --> 39:23.426
So I just worry because I don't
want to see Darcey hurt again.

39:24.495 --> 39:26.229
There's more.
The money in the socks.

39:26.231 --> 39:27.430
[Michael] Money in the who?

39:27.432 --> 39:30.367
- What is this guy? A stripper?
- [Stacey] $1500.

39:30.369 --> 39:32.535
- 1500 bucks?
- 1400?

39:32.537 --> 39:34.037
I don't remember.

39:34.039 --> 39:35.638
- Does he have a job?
- [Darcey] Not right now.

39:35.640 --> 39:38.208
Because of the pandemic, he
chose not to do massages anymore

39:38.210 --> 39:40.043
because he doesn't want
to get Covid.

39:40.045 --> 39:42.112
- You can put gloves on.
- Darcey pays for everything.

39:42.114 --> 39:45.048
She pays for the rim. Takes
him shopping, buys the food,

39:45.050 --> 39:48.651
but when he does need money,
fast money, he uses his credit card.

39:48.653 --> 39:51.654
Yeah, he's racking up
a lot of [beep] debt.

39:52.790 --> 39:54.557
That's how he's been living.

39:54.559 --> 39:56.559
He's just racking up debt
left and right.

39:58.562 --> 40:02.232
This is the most irresponsible
thing you can do in life

40:02.234 --> 40:03.666
is use credit cards.

40:03.668 --> 40:04.734
- I know.
- For everything.

40:04.736 --> 40:06.102
Exactly.

40:06.104 --> 40:08.004
How are you with this dude
right now?

40:08.006 --> 40:10.640
We're in a better place now.

40:10.642 --> 40:12.409
This is the test.
Miami is a test.

40:12.411 --> 40:15.311
Okay, Michael, I would need
to know for myself.

40:17.982 --> 40:19.616
How long you with this guy?

40:19.618 --> 40:20.784
Over a year.

40:22.286 --> 40:25.655
Cut him now. Cut him. Cut him.

40:29.293 --> 40:30.527
- You trust me?
- [Darcey] Yeah.

40:30.594 --> 40:32.962
You know how, you know how
I'm never wrong about [beep].

40:34.031 --> 40:35.131
Cut him now

40:35.133 --> 40:37.100
because everything
you're telling me right now

40:37.102 --> 40:41.237
is exactly the kind of stuff that you don't
want to happen three years from now.

40:43.340 --> 40:45.141
I want to see Darcey and Stacey

40:45.143 --> 40:48.578
with guys that are going to take care
of them, treat them like goddesses.

40:48.580 --> 40:51.214
So Stacey said she was happy
and everything is cool,

40:51.216 --> 40:54.517
but what I'm hearing
about Georgi, I'm not happy.

40:54.519 --> 40:57.287
So I'm not sure if I could just
like, let that slide right now.

40:57.289 --> 40:59.656
I want to know from him
what's going on.

40:59.658 --> 41:01.791
I want to meet the guy. When
do I get to meet your boys?

41:01.793 --> 41:03.960
[Stacey] I want you to meet
up. We'll put something up.

41:03.962 --> 41:06.029
I want to know the guy
that are dating my girls.

41:11.135 --> 41:12.936
[Georgi speaking]

41:14.472 --> 41:16.172
Grandma, are you dying?

41:16.174 --> 41:17.373
- Oh, my God.
- Are your feet on fire?

41:17.375 --> 41:18.675
My feet are on fire.

41:18.677 --> 41:23.213
- Going to the beach.
- Having some fun in the sun [indistinct].

41:24.682 --> 41:27.083
I actually see some similarities

41:27.085 --> 41:29.085
between Georgi
and your ex-husband.

41:29.087 --> 41:33.556
My ex-husband lacked the
motivation at times financially

41:33.558 --> 41:34.691
to get ahead.

41:34.693 --> 41:36.392
Do you think
there's the chance that

41:36.394 --> 41:38.695
what didn't work out
in your first marriage

41:38.697 --> 41:40.830
is maybe like a trigger for you?

41:42.399 --> 41:44.367
[chorus] Hello.

41:44.369 --> 41:47.237
Welcome to the House
of the Living Casting Call.

41:47.239 --> 41:48.805
The fashion show is in few days.

41:48.807 --> 41:49.906
Show some abs.

41:49.908 --> 41:51.574
Yeah, take that shirt off.
Okay.

41:51.576 --> 41:54.143
And we're holding
a casting call for our models

41:54.145 --> 41:57.380
and Aniko and Aspen are
walking in the show as well.

41:57.382 --> 42:01.184
As with your next,
you got this within the show.

42:01.186 --> 42:04.187
I'm just freaking out whether if
I'm not going to be good enough.

42:04.189 --> 42:06.623
Like, I can't walk like them.

42:06.625 --> 42:07.991
Yeah, I'm super nervous.

42:09.827 --> 42:13.796
[beep] hearing about you, bro,
is not really cool.

42:13.798 --> 42:15.798
Money in the socks,
credit card debt.

42:15.800 --> 42:17.166
[Georgi speaking]

42:17.168 --> 42:19.302
Excuse me? Back [beep] bro.

42:19.304 --> 42:20.436
Now you're getting out of line.

42:20.438 --> 42:21.604
<i>[Darcey] This is not good.</i>

42:21.606 --> 42:22.805
This is getting out of control.

42:22.807 --> 42:24.541
[Georgi speaking]

42:25.976 --> 42:27.710
[Michael]
You can't do that [beep].
