00:05.490 --> 00:07.630
Previously on "Mr. Mercedes"...

00:07.730 --> 00:10.130
Showing up to a jobs fair
in a Mercedes-Benz.

00:10.330 --> 00:11.300
Sign of the times, I guess, right?

00:11.500 --> 00:14.130
Maybe it's the Mayor,
coming to check out his big to-do.

00:16.270 --> 00:18.470
Got 16 dead, triple that in injuries.

00:18.670 --> 00:19.720
Somebody lost control.

00:19.920 --> 00:20.770
He didn't lose control.

00:20.970 --> 00:23.540
Retirement... You hate it, don't you?

00:23.740 --> 00:24.210
It's an adjustment.

00:24.410 --> 00:25.880
When was the last time you had sex?

00:26.080 --> 00:27.410
You propositioning me, Ida?

00:27.610 --> 00:30.280
You need to find some sort of purpose.

00:35.820 --> 00:36.950
Jerome! Shit!

00:37.150 --> 00:38.490
You any good at computers?

00:38.690 --> 00:39.620
Yeah. You know I am.

00:39.820 --> 00:42.230
Is it possible for a file
to just disappear on its own?

00:42.430 --> 00:43.360
Whoever did this knows his shit.

00:43.560 --> 00:45.300
And this is your job right here, Brady.

00:45.500 --> 00:47.300
Now, whether you choose
to see me as such or not,

00:47.500 --> 00:48.770
I'm sort of your mentor in life.

00:48.970 --> 00:51.030
Was it ever disclosed
that the Smiley Face sticker

00:51.230 --> 00:52.400
was found on the steering wheel?

00:52.600 --> 00:53.470
Of all the cases
for you to obsess over...

00:53.670 --> 00:55.110
16 people died! I'm still on the case.

00:55.310 --> 00:56.310
You're retired.

02:44.150 --> 02:47.020
Yay!

02:47.220 --> 02:48.820
You did so good!

02:49.020 --> 02:51.020
Can you smile for the camera?

02:51.220 --> 02:53.090
Look right at Grandma.

02:53.290 --> 02:56.690
Oh, it's certainly a big day,
one month old.

02:56.890 --> 03:02.230
Y'know, if you were a dog,
you'd be like five years old.

03:02.430 --> 03:03.030
Is that right?

03:03.230 --> 03:04.400
I think you got the math

03:04.600 --> 03:05.770
a little backwards, sweetie.

03:05.970 --> 03:07.470
Oh, yeah. That's okay.

03:07.670 --> 03:10.970
I think we'll leave
the math tutoring to Grandma,

03:11.170 --> 03:14.710
and then I'll stay in charge of fashion.

03:16.180 --> 03:19.920
I bet when you grow up

03:20.120 --> 03:23.990
you might be the first woman president.

03:24.190 --> 03:25.120
Wouldn't that be something?

03:26.720 --> 03:28.860
We can dream, right, Grandma?

03:53.220 --> 03:55.550
Okay.

04:40.200 --> 04:42.000
Who's out there?

04:42.200 --> 04:44.000
Who's there?

04:48.200 --> 04:50.140
I'm not in the fucking mood.

04:50.340 --> 04:52.680
I will blow your head off,
so help me, God.

04:52.880 --> 04:54.680
Freeze!

04:57.680 --> 05:00.420
Fred, for fuck's sake.

05:04.420 --> 05:05.490
Freeze! You!

05:05.690 --> 05:06.560
Aah!
Freeze!

05:06.760 --> 05:08.020
Don't you fucking move!

05:08.220 --> 05:10.960
I'll blow your head off!
You're a goddamn dead man!

05:16.430 --> 05:19.640
Jesus fucking Christ.

05:19.840 --> 05:21.840
Aah!

05:22.040 --> 05:24.710
What the hell were you doing in there?

05:24.910 --> 05:26.380
Bill? What's the matter?

05:26.580 --> 05:27.780
Call an ambulance.

05:27.980 --> 05:29.450
Oh my God!

05:29.650 --> 05:31.980
Just call an ambulance, would you?

05:34.450 --> 05:35.650
Yeah.

05:35.850 --> 05:38.390
It's good and broke.
But you're gonna be fine.

05:38.590 --> 05:39.860
Please, help me.

05:40.060 --> 05:42.460
We don't know right now...

05:49.330 --> 05:50.670
Who is he?

05:50.870 --> 05:54.200
He's the neighbor, lives next door.

05:54.400 --> 05:56.140
Always playing street hockey.

05:56.340 --> 05:57.810
What was he doing in your back yard?

05:58.010 --> 06:00.945
I dunno. Climbing the fence.

06:01.145 --> 06:04.080
Here. Drink this. Quickly.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.420
What?

06:05.620 --> 06:07.880
Your breath. You smell like a saloon.

06:08.080 --> 06:11.820
Loaded man, loaded gun,
it's not good, Bill.

06:13.960 --> 06:16.690
Drink it! God.

06:16.890 --> 06:18.960
What happened was this:

06:19.160 --> 06:22.300
I saw you becoming unhinged
after the incident.

06:22.500 --> 06:23.130
You were having a panic attack.

06:23.330 --> 06:26.500
I brought you whiskey
to calm your nerves.

06:26.700 --> 06:28.310
Do it.

06:28.510 --> 06:31.045
With any luck,
somebody will catch it on camera.

06:31.245 --> 06:33.780
You can introduce it
at your trial as Exhibit A.

06:33.980 --> 06:36.910
You almost shot a kid, Bill.

06:47.990 --> 06:49.930
He snuck out to go to a party.

06:50.130 --> 06:53.130
You evidently caught him
sneaking back in.

06:53.330 --> 06:55.265
Is he gonna be okay?

06:55.465 --> 06:56.732
Mangled his arm good.

06:56.932 --> 06:58.200
He said you had a gun.

06:58.400 --> 06:59.440
I did, yeah.

06:59.640 --> 07:01.490
I thought he was an intruder.

07:01.690 --> 07:03.615
I got a permit for the gun,

07:03.815 --> 07:06.212
I'm a retired police officer.

07:06.412 --> 07:08.810
Decorated retired detective.

07:09.010 --> 07:11.080
This is Bill Hodges.

07:11.280 --> 07:12.020
Ugh.

07:12.220 --> 07:13.080
Where's the weapon now?

07:13.280 --> 07:15.020
Back in the house.

07:17.620 --> 07:20.090
Need to calm my nerves.

07:20.290 --> 07:22.137
Too much adrenaline,
it's not good for the heart.

07:23.890 --> 07:25.360
The boy said you pointed the gun

07:25.560 --> 07:26.830
at his head and threatened him.

07:27.030 --> 07:28.970
Yeah, well, like I said,
I thought he was an intruder.

07:29.170 --> 07:30.970
I was scared for my life.

07:31.170 --> 07:32.370
There a problem?

07:33.970 --> 07:36.040
Nope.

07:37.510 --> 07:39.780
Fucking dick.

07:46.250 --> 07:48.250
Are you sure you're okay?

07:48.450 --> 07:49.790
I've got an herb tea I like before bed.

07:49.990 --> 07:52.255
It calms me if I'm anxious.

07:52.455 --> 07:54.720
I'm good. Bourbon hit the spot.

08:00.130 --> 08:02.130
Thank you, Ida. I'm fine.

08:02.330 --> 08:04.200
You don't look fine.

08:04.400 --> 08:04.670
I am.

08:04.870 --> 08:06.940
Thank you again.

08:17.010 --> 08:19.780
Bill,
retirement messes with some people.

08:19.980 --> 08:22.550
Yeah, that seems to be a running theme.

08:22.750 --> 08:26.620
You know, for what it's worth,
I'm good with mess.

08:26.820 --> 08:27.860
Look at the way I live.

08:28.060 --> 08:30.690
Life is s'posed to be messy,
I read it somewhere.

08:32.200 --> 08:36.370
Well, seems like you're
right where you want to be.

08:39.240 --> 08:41.169
Well, I'm just next door.

08:41.370 --> 08:42.710
Yep, thank you.

08:46.980 --> 08:48.980
Good night.

09:49.640 --> 09:52.710
We don't give warranties with repairs.

09:52.910 --> 09:55.450
That is only on new products.

09:56.450 --> 09:57.850
Don't stand behind your work?

09:58.050 --> 10:00.450
We do, wh,
we're very proud of our service.

10:00.650 --> 10:03.050
Uh, our policy with warranties,
however...

10:03.250 --> 10:04.590
Yeah, fine.

10:04.790 --> 10:07.860
Thank you for your patronage, sir.

10:10.660 --> 10:12.600
What was that?

10:14.460 --> 10:17.600
Oh, um...
that's also a policy that we have.

10:17.800 --> 10:21.600
We thank customers
for their continued patronage.

10:23.470 --> 10:25.880
Can I say something?

10:26.080 --> 10:27.110
I may be out of line, but...

10:27.310 --> 10:29.480
Oh, yeah, no. Please.
Yeah, it's a free country.

10:29.680 --> 10:31.480
I mean, sort of.

10:33.220 --> 10:36.690
I have small children.
Sometimes, I bring them with me.

10:36.890 --> 10:39.925
I have no problem
with alternative lifestyles.

10:40.125 --> 10:43.160
But when it's flaunted...
kids might get the idea

10:43.360 --> 10:45.030
that it's not alternative.

10:45.230 --> 10:46.630
That it's normal.

10:46.830 --> 10:49.900
That's a message that concerns me.

10:52.770 --> 10:55.840
I understand.

10:56.040 --> 11:00.845
And not to exacerbate your concern,

11:01.045 --> 11:05.147
but, uh... there was this recent study

11:05.347 --> 11:09.250
out of Germany that says that by 2060

11:09.450 --> 11:13.320
homosexuals are gonna completely
rule the world.

11:13.520 --> 11:14.590
Actually, just the dykes.

11:14.790 --> 11:19.660
The pansies, well,
they'll still be pansies.

11:19.860 --> 11:21.860
Thank God, right?

11:22.060 --> 11:22.930
Freak.

11:35.340 --> 11:36.575
What... the fuck... Was that?

11:36.775 --> 11:39.062
Did you hear what he said to me?

11:39.262 --> 11:41.276
I don't care. He's a customer.

11:41.476 --> 11:43.083
So he's allowed to gay-bash?

11:43.283 --> 11:44.690
Yes. He's the fucking customer.

11:44.890 --> 11:47.220
Oh my God, Lou.
You act like people need us,

11:47.420 --> 11:48.120
like they gotta come here.

11:48.320 --> 11:49.805
Why don't we just hang a sign that says,

11:50.005 --> 11:51.490
"We sell shit, but we don't take it,"

11:51.690 --> 11:53.230
it'll save us a little time.

11:53.430 --> 11:55.500
And you. Brady?

11:55.700 --> 11:58.570
It is not appropriate for you
to find her funny. Ever.

11:58.770 --> 12:01.600
Our bread and butter... Our lifeline...

12:01.800 --> 12:02.640
Is customer service.

12:02.840 --> 12:05.710
It's the only thing
that tethers us to survival,

12:05.910 --> 12:08.110
customer fucking service.

12:08.310 --> 12:09.910
Wait. Did you just smile again?

12:10.110 --> 12:11.850
I'm sorry.

12:12.050 --> 12:14.180
You're not sorry, Brady.

12:14.380 --> 12:16.990
I have a compass for contrition.

12:17.190 --> 12:18.920
You're not sorry at all.

12:20.920 --> 12:22.730
Alright.

12:22.930 --> 12:25.130
We're all three gonna
revisit this at lunchtime.

12:25.330 --> 12:26.660
Robi.
And certain issues

12:26.860 --> 12:29.470
will be addressed.

12:29.670 --> 12:33.270
There are certain realities you
both need to be made aware of.

12:34.400 --> 12:37.470
I hate reality checks.

12:40.810 --> 12:42.750
So you got this by e-mail?

12:42.950 --> 12:49.350
Yeah, that had the link to the...
to the other UVid shit.

12:49.550 --> 12:51.520
Family evidently posted this as,
you know,

12:51.720 --> 12:53.690
some kind of memorial tribute
or whatever.

12:55.020 --> 12:56.730
Okay, so our guy...

12:56.930 --> 13:00.760
Distorted it, and then sent
the distorted version to me.

13:00.960 --> 13:02.630
Distorted it exactly how?

13:02.830 --> 13:06.040
Just... He just had some stuff
coming out of her mouth.

13:06.240 --> 13:07.570
The point is,

13:07.770 --> 13:09.770
it's not in the original UVid thing,
you know?

13:09.970 --> 13:12.040
Yeah.

13:12.240 --> 13:13.780
Well,
this guy is still covering his tracks

13:13.980 --> 13:15.650
pretty good with the e-mail itself.

13:18.510 --> 13:22.050
Wow, this guy's really trying to
get into your head, isn't he?

13:22.250 --> 13:23.650
Yeah, seems so.

13:25.190 --> 13:27.460
And this lady,
she was one of the victims

13:27.660 --> 13:28.345
of that Mercedes thing?

13:34.600 --> 13:37.070
Yeah, sh-she and the baby both.

13:43.140 --> 13:44.940
Yeah, hello?

13:45.140 --> 13:46.680
Bill, you shoot anybody today?

13:46.880 --> 13:48.280
Or almost?

13:48.480 --> 13:51.010
You're hysterical.

13:51.210 --> 13:51.880
We need to have a little talk,
my friend.

13:52.080 --> 13:54.350
Yeah, why is that?

13:54.550 --> 13:56.490
Because there's a kid lying
in a hospital bed right now

13:56.690 --> 13:57.890
whose head you almost
blew off last night.

13:58.090 --> 13:59.490
Come on down to the station.

13:59.690 --> 14:02.160
He was trespassing on my property.

14:02.360 --> 14:03.960
In the middle of the night!

14:04.160 --> 14:06.500
Come down to the station, Bill.
I'm serious.

14:06.700 --> 14:07.700
Fuck.

14:11.530 --> 14:16.155
<i>Well, I stepped into an avalanche</i>

14:16.355 --> 14:20.980
<i>It covered up my soul</i>

14:22.550 --> 14:27.320
<i>Fuck. When I am not this
hunchback that you see</i>

14:27.520 --> 14:29.550
<i>I sleep beneath the golden hill</i>

14:29.750 --> 14:31.250
Fuck it!

14:32.920 --> 14:36.660
<i>You who wished to conquer pain</i>

14:36.860 --> 14:44.330
<i>You must learn, learn to serve me well</i>

14:54.140 --> 14:58.610
<i>You strike my side by accident</i>

14:58.810 --> 15:03.420
<i>As you go down for your gold</i>

15:04.520 --> 15:10.360
<i>The cripple here
that you clothe and feed</i>

15:10.560 --> 15:14.700
<i>Is neither starved nor cold</i>

15:14.900 --> 15:19.240
<i>He does not ask for your company</i>

15:19.440 --> 15:26.440
<i>Not at the center,
the center of the world</i>

15:39.320 --> 15:43.190
<i>It is your turn, beloved</i>

15:43.390 --> 15:50.200
<i>It is your flesh that I wear</i>

15:50.930 --> 15:52.400
How you doing?

15:58.410 --> 16:00.680
Hey, Bill. How you doing?
Good, yeah.

16:00.880 --> 16:03.210
Never better.

16:08.350 --> 16:09.150
What do you want?

16:09.350 --> 16:11.350
How deep in the bag you?

16:11.550 --> 16:12.050
Not at all.

16:12.250 --> 16:14.160
A little bourbon to calm my nerves.

16:14.360 --> 16:14.990
By 2:00 in the morning,

16:15.190 --> 16:16.830
I figure you to be pretty much a skunk.

16:17.030 --> 16:20.230
You're outside in your
pajamas with a loaded gun.

16:20.430 --> 16:22.400
By all reports, you looked shit-faced.

16:22.600 --> 16:24.370
You pointed your weapon at a teenager,

16:24.570 --> 16:26.535
one whose head
you threatened to blow off.

16:26.735 --> 16:28.700
Anybody else but you,
you're in a jail cell.

16:28.900 --> 16:30.640
Lucky to be me I guess.

16:30.840 --> 16:32.380
What were you doing just now
in the parking lot?

16:32.580 --> 16:34.180
What do you mean?

16:34.380 --> 16:36.550
I mean you were standing there
in a fucking daze.

16:36.750 --> 16:38.050
I wasn't in a daze. What were you doing?

16:38.250 --> 16:40.720
I was just looking around.
And smelling shit.

16:40.920 --> 16:42.990
You were smelling shit?

16:43.190 --> 16:45.229
Yeah, my sensories opened up,
and I was smelling shit.

16:56.400 --> 17:01.000
I was just taking some measure...
that's all.

17:01.200 --> 17:03.010
M-Measure? Measure of what?

17:03.210 --> 17:04.869
Of everything.

17:05.069 --> 17:08.140
The units, the buildings...

17:08.339 --> 17:11.210
the place I used to belong.

17:11.410 --> 17:15.585
Smells, colors,
stuff I never did before.

17:15.785 --> 17:19.960
Imagine that? 30-years-plus a detective,

17:20.160 --> 17:22.560
in the business of seeing this shit

17:22.760 --> 17:24.960
that other lay eyes don't notice.

17:25.160 --> 17:27.160
And you miss things
right in front of your nose.

17:27.359 --> 17:30.300
That's what I was doing
in the parking lot.

17:30.500 --> 17:34.040
Just seeing and smelling
the shit right in front of me.

17:38.970 --> 17:43.180
Bill, how...
how much have you been drinking lately?

17:43.380 --> 17:44.180
Not enough.

17:44.380 --> 17:45.850
Last night, for example,

17:46.050 --> 17:47.450
I was interrupted by the trespasser.

17:47.650 --> 17:49.885
The latest medical wisdom
on men of advancing years

17:50.085 --> 17:52.320
is they might want to cut back
on downing their weight

17:52.520 --> 17:53.860
in vodka and beer.

17:54.060 --> 17:55.260
Crazy talk.

17:55.460 --> 17:57.990
You'll die, Bill. Like, real soon.

17:58.190 --> 17:59.930
Fuck off.

18:00.130 --> 18:01.950
You... You nearly shot a kid.

18:02.150 --> 18:03.770
I didn't nearly shoot a kid.

18:03.970 --> 18:05.730
You did. A child.
Get that through your head.

18:07.800 --> 18:09.670
Almost put an empty chair
at the table for his family

18:09.870 --> 18:11.340
to look at the rest of their lives.

18:11.540 --> 18:13.540
Please, that.

18:16.950 --> 18:18.880
Garbage men and... and...
And guys who sell insurance

18:19.080 --> 18:20.450
can retire clean.

18:20.650 --> 18:22.420
But we...
we have all these cases we thought

18:22.620 --> 18:24.490
we'd get another crack at.

18:24.690 --> 18:27.960
You get up every day now knowing
you didn't catch that perp,

18:28.160 --> 18:31.430
clear that case, didn't...
Didn't speak up for that victim.

18:31.630 --> 18:33.900
The motivational part of
the speech coming up, is it?

18:34.100 --> 18:35.560
Find a goal.

18:35.760 --> 18:38.030
Painting, model airplanes,
some fucking thing.

18:38.230 --> 18:40.500
I don't want to go to
your funeral in six months.

18:40.900 --> 18:42.310
They'll make me a pallbearer,

18:42.510 --> 18:44.370
and you're too fucking fat to carry.

18:44.570 --> 18:46.440
I'll tweak my back,
have to file for disability,

18:46.640 --> 18:48.010
and end up where you're at.

18:48.210 --> 18:49.580
And that'll fucking blow.

18:53.050 --> 18:54.650
Coffee still tastes like piss.

19:05.130 --> 19:06.460
Get a fucking hobby?

19:06.660 --> 19:08.800
I've got a fucking hobby alright.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
What's wrong with you?

19:10.200 --> 19:12.400
You never see an old guy
talking to himself before?

19:12.600 --> 19:15.400
You're new to the planet, are you?

19:15.600 --> 19:18.410
Fuck off while you're at it.

19:29.350 --> 19:31.090
Get out of the fucking way.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.830
You get a fucking hobby.

19:43.030 --> 19:45.000
Bollocks!

19:47.900 --> 19:50.110
<i>Run, Spot, run</i>

19:50.310 --> 19:52.340
<i>Run, Spot, run</i>

19:52.540 --> 19:55.310
<i>At 6:00, the milkman comes around</i>

19:57.180 --> 20:00.250
<i>Another day in anytown</i>

20:01.780 --> 20:04.550
<i>I wake up with a frown</i>

20:04.750 --> 20:05.990
Brady?

20:06.190 --> 20:08.520
<i>Another day in anytown
Busy!</i>

20:08.720 --> 20:10.155
<i>Run, Spot, run</i>

20:10.355 --> 20:11.590
Open the door!

20:11.790 --> 20:13.930
<i>Run, spot, run</i>

20:14.130 --> 20:15.600
<i>...Sally, Dick, and Mark</i>

20:15.800 --> 20:17.330
I said busy!

20:17.530 --> 20:20.000
<i>We took my dog Spot to the park
Open the door, please!</i>

20:20.200 --> 20:21.540
Come on, open the door.

20:36.290 --> 20:37.655
Why aren't you at work?

20:37.855 --> 20:39.020
I'm headed right back.

20:39.220 --> 20:40.760
I just have something here I have to do.

20:40.960 --> 20:42.390
What?

20:42.590 --> 20:43.130
It's private.

20:43.330 --> 20:45.490
I-I want to come down there.

20:45.690 --> 20:45.830
What? No.

20:46.030 --> 20:47.430
This is my house.

20:47.630 --> 20:50.570
And that's my work space.
No fucking way.

20:50.770 --> 20:53.500
Did you just swear at me, Brady?

20:53.700 --> 20:54.840
I'm sorry.

20:55.040 --> 20:56.010
I'd like to talk to you, please.

20:56.210 --> 20:57.370
Well, I've gotta head back to the store.

20:57.570 --> 21:00.310
I don't care. We need to talk.

21:00.510 --> 21:01.840
Now.

21:10.050 --> 21:13.520
I'd like to know about this
secret project of yours.

21:13.720 --> 21:17.130
I have a right to know what's
going on in my house, Brady.

21:17.330 --> 21:19.795
I'll tell you when the time is right.

21:19.995 --> 21:22.460
That's not a satisfactory response.

21:22.660 --> 21:25.200
Well, you'll have to make do.

21:25.400 --> 21:28.470
Isn't that your specialty? Making do?

21:28.670 --> 21:32.940
There's a saying...
Maybe you've heard it...

21:33.140 --> 21:37.550
A mother can only be as happy
as her saddest child.

21:37.750 --> 21:41.680
You seem very sad to me, Brady.

21:41.880 --> 21:43.820
Almost angry, in fact.

21:44.020 --> 21:47.420
Now you and I have been through
some considerable hardships.

21:47.620 --> 21:48.220
We lost your father and your brother...

21:48.420 --> 21:50.230
I don't want to talk about it.

21:52.630 --> 21:54.230
Well,
I think maybe it needs to be discussed.

21:54.430 --> 21:56.370
No, no, no, no.

21:56.570 --> 21:58.570
Eat.

21:59.770 --> 22:01.500
It's good for your blood sugar.

22:07.110 --> 22:10.250
Look, let me just say this.

22:10.450 --> 22:15.180
I won't presume to understand your life.

22:15.380 --> 22:17.350
Life...

22:17.550 --> 22:19.520
you're it.

22:21.720 --> 22:23.860
You're all I have.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.130
When I go to bed at night,
I-I never know

22:29.330 --> 22:30.530
whether to be excited about

22:30.730 --> 22:32.740
what's going on in that basement.

22:32.940 --> 22:34.870
Or worried.

22:35.070 --> 22:39.010
I I...
I lie in bed, and I agonize, Brady.

22:39.210 --> 22:41.210
I agonize.

22:43.680 --> 22:46.550
Now. E-Either you care about that.

22:46.750 --> 22:48.150
Or you don't.

23:32.460 --> 23:34.160
I would ask that you be somewhat quiet

23:34.360 --> 23:36.060
as my mother is upstairs sleeping.

23:36.260 --> 23:38.330
She's not well.

23:38.530 --> 23:40.000
I don't know
what I can possibly tell you

23:40.200 --> 23:42.340
that I haven't already.

23:42.540 --> 23:43.810
Thank you.

23:44.010 --> 23:45.410
Well, we were just wondering...

23:45.610 --> 23:46.810
And I know we've asked before...

23:47.010 --> 23:48.880
But we still wonder
whether it's possible

23:49.080 --> 23:51.750
that either you left
the key in the ignition...

23:51.950 --> 23:54.280
Of course I didn't.

23:54.480 --> 23:56.080
...or if there's a spare key...

23:56.280 --> 23:57.090
The key was in my hand.

23:57.290 --> 23:59.220
I locked the car
with my key when I got out,

23:59.420 --> 24:00.160
as I always do.

24:01.890 --> 24:03.690
The thing is, Mrs. Trelawney,

24:03.890 --> 24:05.795
it's kind of an unconscious thing,

24:05.995 --> 24:07.762
where somebody puts their key.

24:07.962 --> 24:09.530
It becomes a form of habit.

24:09.730 --> 24:11.885
Do you think possibly...
The key was in my hand.

24:12.085 --> 24:14.240
There's nothing unconscious about it,
Detective.

24:14.440 --> 24:15.770
The fob has a panic button.

24:15.970 --> 24:19.370
I always hold the key should
I be attacked by a mugger.

24:19.570 --> 24:22.980
I keep the key in my hand,
finger on the button,

24:23.180 --> 24:24.850
until I'm safely in my own house.

24:25.050 --> 24:26.980
I never get out of the car
without my key.

24:27.180 --> 24:28.720
Never.

24:28.920 --> 24:30.250
I gave you the key, for God's sakes.

24:30.450 --> 24:34.260
But if it were a spare key instead...
It wasn't.

24:34.460 --> 24:37.060
Am I not making myself clear?

24:37.260 --> 24:40.000
No, you seem pretty positive, actually.

24:40.200 --> 24:41.685
Almost defensive.

24:41.885 --> 24:43.170
How dare you?

24:43.370 --> 24:45.930
I wasn't suggesting...
You most certainly were.

24:46.130 --> 24:47.370
And it is suggested by many

24:47.570 --> 24:49.570
that I'm partially to blame
for this tragedy.

24:49.770 --> 24:50.210
It is outrageous.

24:50.410 --> 24:53.480
We don't mean to offend you.

25:18.900 --> 25:20.840
Afternoon, sir.
May I ask what you're doing here?

25:21.040 --> 25:23.710
You've been parked here quite a while.

25:23.910 --> 25:26.640
Sir?

25:26.840 --> 25:29.240
Well,
I hope you have the authority to ask.

25:29.440 --> 25:32.350
Beg your pardon?

25:32.550 --> 25:34.650
I think you're private security,
but I want to see some ID.

25:34.850 --> 25:37.485
Then,
I want to see the carry-conceal permit

25:37.685 --> 25:40.120
for that cannon
you got inside your coat.

25:40.320 --> 25:42.520
And it better be in your wallet
and not in the glove compartment

25:42.720 --> 25:44.660
of your car,
or you're in violation of Section 19

25:44.860 --> 25:47.200
of the City Firearms Code.

25:47.400 --> 25:49.060
Are you a cop?

25:49.260 --> 25:50.470
Retired.

25:50.670 --> 25:52.670
And I've forgotten neither my
rights nor your responsibility.

25:52.870 --> 25:56.200
So, let me see your ID
and your carry permit.

25:56.400 --> 25:59.340
Then we can discuss my presence here.

26:06.680 --> 26:10.020
Vigilant Guard Services. Good name.

26:10.220 --> 26:12.520
Your turn.

26:12.720 --> 26:15.020
Bill Hodges.

26:16.020 --> 26:18.490
Ended my tour Detective First Class.

26:18.690 --> 26:20.960
My last big case
was the Mercedes killer.

26:21.160 --> 26:23.970
I'm guessing that'll give you
a good idea what I'm doing here.

26:24.170 --> 26:26.500
Olivia Trelawney. She's dead, you know.

26:26.700 --> 26:27.500
Yeah, I heard.

26:27.700 --> 26:29.970
Does somebody live in there now?

26:30.170 --> 26:33.180
Not as far as I know.
Sister inherited it.

26:33.380 --> 26:36.310
She keeps an eye on the place,
checks in from time to time.

26:36.510 --> 26:39.780
The sister? Janey Patterson?

26:39.980 --> 26:41.780
Yeah, that's the one. She's a nice lady.

26:41.980 --> 26:44.220
I thought she lived in Los Angeles.

26:44.420 --> 26:46.660
Moved back to look after her mother.

26:46.860 --> 26:48.595
Mother still alive?

26:48.795 --> 26:50.530
As far as I know.

26:52.390 --> 26:55.330
It goes without saying,
this store faces enormous challenges.

26:55.530 --> 26:59.530
But should it need saying,
we're covered.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.340
Yeah, yeah, we're totally good on that.

27:05.810 --> 27:09.380
The future is fraught with uncertainty

27:09.580 --> 27:13.150
as the world continues to go digital.

27:13.350 --> 27:17.020
Electronics, DVD's...

27:17.220 --> 27:20.520
So much of what we sell
will be obsolete in a heartbeat.

27:20.720 --> 27:22.490
My concern is that
we're not ready to surmount

27:22.690 --> 27:24.760
the enormous hurdles that lie ahead.

27:24.960 --> 27:28.430
Do you know what business goodwill is,
Lou?

27:28.630 --> 27:29.700
Kind of. Tell me.

27:29.900 --> 27:35.170
When you don't give customers
shit for gay-bashing.

27:39.510 --> 27:43.550
I like you both.
You both have good skill-sets.

27:43.750 --> 27:45.450
But I find you both to be riddled

27:45.650 --> 27:46.580
with underlying contempt.

27:46.780 --> 27:49.380
Contempt for me is okay. I'm the boss.

27:49.580 --> 27:53.720
Contempt for the customer however,
that is untenable.

27:56.320 --> 27:58.930
Brady, my deeper concern runs to you.

27:59.130 --> 28:02.360
You're... weird.

28:02.560 --> 28:04.670
I'm sorry,
I wish I could find a softer term

28:04.870 --> 28:07.140
or something more clinical, but frankly,

28:07.340 --> 28:09.870
sometimes you come across
as just plain weird.

28:10.070 --> 28:12.540
Robi, you don't get to say that.

28:12.740 --> 28:13.940
To say it.

28:14.140 --> 28:16.680
The customers like Brady,
they request him all the time.

28:16.880 --> 28:18.150
Because he can fix shit.

28:18.350 --> 28:20.880
But they also find him
"a little off" occasionally.

28:21.080 --> 28:23.950
Look, you want more than your station,

28:24.150 --> 28:27.020
you have to dial that back to zero.

28:30.760 --> 28:35.530
In three weeks, as you know,
The Edmund Mills Arts Center

28:35.730 --> 28:37.170
is having its groundbreaking gala.

28:37.370 --> 28:39.170
Thousands of people figure to be there.

28:39.370 --> 28:40.240
I'm told even the Governor.

28:40.440 --> 28:42.070
Depending on who's running the store,

28:42.270 --> 28:45.110
I'm gonna need either or both
of you manning our booth there.

28:45.310 --> 28:48.040
This is a business opportunity for us.

28:48.240 --> 28:50.075
I cannot have you flippant.

28:50.275 --> 28:52.110
I cannot have you impersonable.

28:52.310 --> 28:54.720
You "a little off."

28:54.920 --> 28:57.555
Do you hear what
I'm telling both of you?

28:57.755 --> 29:00.390
You either shape up, or I ship you out.

29:00.590 --> 29:03.260
Now, let's go move some product!

29:42.360 --> 29:44.230
Bill. Ida.

29:44.430 --> 29:46.370
Uh... Malasadas.

29:46.570 --> 29:48.040
Portuguese donut of sorts.

29:48.240 --> 29:49.440
Delicious.

29:49.640 --> 29:51.170
Well.

29:51.370 --> 29:54.910
I-I just wanted to, um...

29:55.110 --> 29:58.110
Thank you for last night.
You were very kind.

29:58.310 --> 29:59.150
I just thought, y'know...

29:59.350 --> 30:02.920
Commemorate my kindness
with a Portuguese donut.

30:03.120 --> 30:04.590
How lovely.

30:04.790 --> 30:05.850
Will you have some tea?

30:06.050 --> 30:08.720
Uh, well, I, um...

30:08.920 --> 30:11.325
Bill, you're retired.

30:11.525 --> 30:13.930
Come and have some tea.

30:21.400 --> 30:24.040
Don't think I've ever sat in a gazebo.

30:24.240 --> 30:26.880
Oh, I love it here in the summertime.

30:27.080 --> 30:29.750
So neat, tidy.

30:29.950 --> 30:33.150
Are you saying I'm fastidious?

30:33.350 --> 30:34.985
Okay.

30:35.185 --> 30:36.620
Anal?

30:36.820 --> 30:38.550
Fastidious is fine.

30:39.250 --> 30:41.360
It's all so perfectly intact.

30:41.560 --> 30:43.760
That's the way I like to keep things.

30:43.960 --> 30:48.300
My mind, my smile, my body.

30:49.970 --> 30:51.370
Relax.

30:51.570 --> 30:53.605
I'm not gonna throw myself at you.

30:53.805 --> 30:55.640
I only do that once. I have my pride.

30:55.840 --> 31:00.180
Going forward,
I will only list in your direction.

31:01.980 --> 31:04.980
Look at that. That's an actual smile.

31:05.180 --> 31:07.050
Don't pull a muscle now.

31:10.320 --> 31:13.460
Do you mind me asking...

31:13.660 --> 31:18.990
you know, like you said,
you know, you've got options.

31:19.190 --> 31:20.825
Like, why...

31:21.025 --> 31:22.460
Why you? Yeah.

31:22.660 --> 31:27.400
Well, you're pleasantly charming.

31:27.600 --> 31:31.140
And incomparably convenient.

31:31.340 --> 31:33.940
I like sleeping alone, in my own bed.

31:34.140 --> 31:36.175
It's rude to throw somebody out,

31:36.375 --> 31:38.210
I don't like driving at night,

31:38.410 --> 31:41.150
especially if I've had a martini or two.

31:41.350 --> 31:44.090
There's something to be said
for right next door.

31:46.960 --> 31:49.090
That's it? I'm convenient?

31:49.290 --> 31:50.090
And charming.

31:57.700 --> 32:00.500
You know, um...

32:00.700 --> 32:05.610
in addition to being
out of control last night,

32:05.810 --> 32:07.980
you seemed... unwell.

32:08.180 --> 32:11.180
Like on the verge of a coronary.

32:11.380 --> 32:14.485
When...
When was the last time you saw a doctor?

32:14.685 --> 32:17.602
I mean,
other than interrogating one on a crime.

32:17.802 --> 32:20.720
Must every conversation
turn to my lack of fitness?

32:20.920 --> 32:24.330
I'm only being a concerned neighbor

32:24.530 --> 32:27.530
who grew up in the family
mortuary business.

32:27.730 --> 32:28.800
I'll leave it at that.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.035
Will you?

32:31.235 --> 32:33.270
I promise.

32:34.670 --> 32:36.540
Alright, well, I got to get back.

32:36.740 --> 32:38.410
I got a tortoise to feed.

32:39.810 --> 32:41.680
Thank you for the tea.

32:41.880 --> 32:42.680
A pleasure.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.460
"Greetings, Detective."

33:36.660 --> 33:39.200
I hope this letter finds you well.

33:39.400 --> 33:40.670
I fear the opposite.

33:40.870 --> 33:43.000
I am informed that
retired police officers

33:43.200 --> 33:45.340
have an extremely high suicide rate.

33:45.540 --> 33:47.480
In most cases, the officers have

33:47.680 --> 33:50.150
no family members who
might see the warning signs.

33:50.350 --> 33:52.810
Many, like you, are divorced,

33:53.010 --> 33:54.750
their grown children
living away from home.

33:54.950 --> 33:59.620
I think of you,
all alone in your house on Harper Road,

33:59.820 --> 34:03.890
Detective Hodges, and I grow concerned.

34:04.090 --> 34:05.630
Are you watching a lot of TV?

34:05.830 --> 34:08.830
Are you drinking more?

34:09.030 --> 34:12.429
I certainly hope
you're monitoring your diet.

34:12.630 --> 34:15.570
Many depressed retired officers...

34:15.770 --> 34:18.310
Rather than sticking
to nutrient-dense foods,

34:18.510 --> 34:21.909
instead opt to eat their gun.

34:22.110 --> 34:25.580
Shedding years off their lives
in the process.

34:25.780 --> 34:30.920
I do hope you'll look after yourself,
Detective.

34:31.120 --> 34:36.260
If not, well...
rest assured I'll keep close watch.

34:36.460 --> 34:39.929
Your devoted follower, Mister Mercedes.

34:40.130 --> 34:43.600
Care to get in touch,
try Under Debbie's Blue Umbrella.

34:43.800 --> 34:46.670
I even got you a username...
Kermitfrog19.

34:46.870 --> 34:48.800
"Password: Smush."

35:15.030 --> 35:16.700
Hey, boss.

35:16.900 --> 35:17.700
Hey.

35:18.900 --> 35:20.970
Odell! Come on, buddy.

35:21.170 --> 35:22.900
You know how the old man feels about you

35:23.100 --> 35:24.110
sitting in his special chair.

35:24.310 --> 35:25.770
Out you go.

35:25.970 --> 35:27.655
Odell!

35:27.855 --> 35:29.017
Come on.

35:29.217 --> 35:30.380
Good boy!

35:35.450 --> 35:37.190
Y'know, you could use a dog.

35:37.390 --> 35:39.550
Keep the kids out of your yard at night.

35:39.750 --> 35:40.860
Dude, that turtle ain't doing shit.

35:41.060 --> 35:43.060
It's a tortoise.

35:43.260 --> 35:43.990
Oh.

35:44.190 --> 35:46.190
I got a letter from my new pen pal.

35:46.390 --> 35:48.860
He put this one in writing.

35:49.060 --> 35:49.900
Seriously? Yeah.

35:50.100 --> 35:53.470
Wow, hard evidence, he's getting sloppy.

35:53.670 --> 35:55.940
Oh, thanks.

35:56.140 --> 35:57.240
Well, what'd he say?

35:57.440 --> 36:01.280
None of your business.
This is between him and me.

36:01.480 --> 36:03.080
What... What do you mean?

36:03.280 --> 36:05.680
Look, I'm like your Watson, Sherlock.

36:05.880 --> 36:09.480
Tell me what he said, please.

36:09.680 --> 36:13.220
Just look at the P.S. Don't touch it.

36:15.360 --> 36:17.290
"P.S. Care to get in touch,"

36:17.490 --> 36:20.960
try Under Debbie's Blue Umbrella.

36:21.160 --> 36:25.500
I even got you a username...
'Kermitfrog19'.

36:25.700 --> 36:27.240
"And your password is 'Smush'."

36:27.440 --> 36:29.640
He even knows my name.

36:29.840 --> 36:31.970
What?

36:32.170 --> 36:34.340
My first given name is Kermit.

36:34.540 --> 36:36.510
I haven't heard it since I was 17,

36:36.710 --> 36:39.580
the day I left
to come here from Ireland.

36:41.720 --> 36:46.920
How am I gonna contact this
Debbie's Blue Umbrella shit?

36:47.120 --> 36:48.390
You listening to me?

36:48.590 --> 36:49.920
No.

36:50.120 --> 36:52.530
I'm still stuck on Kermit,

36:52.730 --> 36:55.400
that's your fucking name? For real?

36:55.600 --> 36:58.130
One of my names.

36:58.330 --> 37:01.070
Just tell me how
I can contact this prick.

37:01.270 --> 37:02.740
Well, I mean, it ain't rocket science.

37:02.940 --> 37:05.940
You just log on to
Under Debbie's Blue Umbrella

37:06.140 --> 37:07.740
and then, wherever it says "username,"

37:07.940 --> 37:10.810
just plug in the "Kermitfrog19."

37:12.350 --> 37:13.880
Okay, wait, I have a question.

37:14.080 --> 37:18.350
Is this like an Irish-green-frog
connection thing?

37:18.550 --> 37:20.885
With the Kermit...

37:21.085 --> 37:23.220
Hardy-har-har.

37:23.420 --> 37:24.690
Alright, can I read
the rest of the letter, Kermit?

37:24.890 --> 37:25.830
No, no, no, I'll tell you what...

37:26.030 --> 37:27.295
You can beat it, that's what you can do.

37:27.495 --> 37:28.697
Oh. And don't come around here anymore.

37:28.897 --> 37:30.100
I don't want you coming round here.

37:30.300 --> 37:31.970
What?

37:32.170 --> 37:33.840
He obviously knows my address.
It's not safe.

37:34.040 --> 37:37.170
Come on, let's go. I mean it.

37:37.370 --> 37:38.310
Alright, well, I mean,
if you need me, you know...

37:38.510 --> 37:39.675
Sure. Call me.

37:39.875 --> 37:41.040
Yeah, thanks.

37:48.320 --> 37:50.320
Yeah.
Come on, push!

37:50.520 --> 37:52.390
I can do it.
I know you can do it! Push!

37:52.590 --> 37:53.955
You got to believe in it! Push! Push!

37:54.155 --> 37:55.237
Come on, Barbara! Keep it moving.

37:55.437 --> 37:56.520
One more pound today. Two pounds!

37:56.720 --> 37:58.030
You push yourself!

37:58.230 --> 37:59.730
If you want it,
you're gonna have to go get it.

37:59.930 --> 38:01.330
I'm trying!

38:01.530 --> 38:04.130
You try harder, Barbara.
That's what it's about.

38:04.330 --> 38:05.700
Hi, Mom.

38:05.900 --> 38:07.070
Mm-hmm.

38:07.270 --> 38:08.400
...that's it. That's all you have to do.

38:08.600 --> 38:10.455
What'cha doing?

38:10.655 --> 38:12.310
Jumping Jacks.

38:12.510 --> 38:13.780
What does it look like I'm doing?

38:13.980 --> 38:15.210
Come on, Barbara. Come on, Barbara.
You got to push.

38:15.410 --> 38:17.280
You got to push if you want it.

38:17.480 --> 38:19.280
Show me you want it.

38:21.280 --> 38:23.420
Push yourself.
I know you can do it. Push.

38:23.620 --> 38:26.150
Let's go, Barbara. Let's do this.

38:26.350 --> 38:27.960
Don't you dare stop!
Don't you dare stop!

38:28.160 --> 38:30.020
You get crazy on it! You keep moving!

38:30.220 --> 38:32.030
Show me you want it.

38:32.230 --> 38:33.760
I can do it.
I know you can do it.

38:33.960 --> 38:36.230
Push! You got to believe it.
Push. Come on, Barbara.

38:36.430 --> 38:38.230
Come on, you got to show what you want.

38:38.430 --> 38:40.030
You want it? You have to go get it.

38:40.230 --> 38:45.540
You, uh...
You wanna know what I'm working on?

38:45.740 --> 38:47.160
Here it is.

38:47.360 --> 38:48.580
What is it?

38:48.780 --> 38:51.615
It's... It's like a remote.

38:51.815 --> 38:54.650
'Cept it's a super remote.

38:54.850 --> 38:56.520
I call it "Thing B."

38:56.720 --> 38:58.990
There was an earlier incarnation...
"Thing A."

38:59.190 --> 39:00.860
But this is "Thing B."

39:01.060 --> 39:03.095
Kind of like those Dr. Seuss books

39:03.295 --> 39:05.330
you used to love when you were a kid.

39:05.530 --> 39:08.330
Slightly different, but...

39:10.200 --> 39:12.500
What does it do?

39:12.700 --> 39:14.685
Controls shit.

39:14.885 --> 39:16.670
Lots of shit.

39:16.870 --> 39:19.670
Thing A could open every
garage door on the street,

39:19.870 --> 39:21.880
not that that's difficult.

39:22.080 --> 39:26.080
Could capture transmitter frequencies,
stuff like that.

39:26.280 --> 39:26.810
This one does more.

39:27.010 --> 39:28.350
Like what?

39:31.020 --> 39:36.160
Let's just say
it activates and de-activates

39:36.360 --> 39:38.230
almost anything I want.

39:38.430 --> 39:41.560
Not everything, but...
you know, depending on

39:41.760 --> 39:43.630
what I program it to.

39:51.040 --> 39:56.540
This is gonna make us rich, Ma.

39:56.740 --> 39:57.280
A few more refinements,

39:57.480 --> 39:59.380
I'll be selling the patent
to The Pentagon.

39:59.580 --> 40:01.250
They'll be fighting wars with it,

40:01.450 --> 40:03.990
you know,
they'll be able to diffuse or...

40:04.190 --> 40:05.850
Or detonate bombs from miles away.

40:08.260 --> 40:11.790
It just looks like a big TV remote.

40:13.190 --> 40:15.930
Well, it controls a lot more.

40:17.470 --> 40:21.000
Has, uh, microchips for a brain.

40:21.200 --> 40:24.540
Soon, I'll be able to control
people's smart phones with this.

40:24.740 --> 40:26.370
Is that legal?

40:26.570 --> 40:30.810
No. That's...
That's why it has to stay so secret.

40:31.010 --> 40:34.220
You don't need to worry, Ma.

40:34.420 --> 40:37.080
I'm taking care of us in that basement.

40:37.280 --> 40:38.650
Wow.

40:38.850 --> 40:43.290
Well, what do you have it
programmed to do now?

40:43.490 --> 40:44.521
Like, what does it... Two things.

40:47.830 --> 40:50.160
Mrs. Blanchard's blinds.

40:50.360 --> 40:52.165
Dirty little boy.

40:52.365 --> 40:54.032
And traffic lights.

40:54.232 --> 40:55.736
Traffic lights?

40:55.936 --> 40:57.323
Red. Yellow. Green.

40:57.523 --> 40:58.910
Whatever I fancy.

41:00.840 --> 41:02.580
W-Which traffic lights?

41:02.780 --> 41:07.110
Um... pretty much all of 'em.

41:08.320 --> 41:10.720
Wow.

41:13.390 --> 41:14.590
Thing B.

41:17.260 --> 41:19.190
Bzzt!

41:48.760 --> 41:50.160
Yes?

41:50.360 --> 41:52.560
Bill Hodges. We spoke on the phone?

41:52.760 --> 41:54.300
Of course. Come up.

42:12.380 --> 42:14.650
Detective. Mrs. Patterson?

42:14.850 --> 42:17.550
Call me Janey. Come in, please.

42:17.750 --> 42:18.650
Okay.

42:20.390 --> 42:22.120
I really appreciate
you agreeing to see me.

42:22.320 --> 42:24.460
I'm more than happy to.

42:24.660 --> 42:27.195
I want to catch this fucking prick.

42:27.395 --> 42:29.930
That's why you're here, isn't it?

42:33.530 --> 42:37.340
Well.
As I said on the phone, I'm now retired.

42:39.540 --> 42:41.945
But you can't let it go.

42:42.145 --> 42:44.350
Officially, I'm not here.

42:44.550 --> 42:47.080
Understood. Would you like coffee?

42:47.280 --> 42:48.420
Anything? No, I'm fine.

42:48.620 --> 42:49.950
Come sit.

43:04.830 --> 43:07.230
Uh, as I mentioned before,

43:07.430 --> 43:08.400
I worked on the case.

43:08.600 --> 43:10.910
You worked on the case, yeah.

43:11.110 --> 43:13.910
My sister spoke of you... not highly.

43:14.110 --> 43:17.980
Ah. Well...

43:18.180 --> 43:19.050
She didn't like most people.

43:19.250 --> 43:21.920
And the feelings were often mutual.

43:22.120 --> 43:22.980
I see.

43:23.180 --> 43:27.190
Uh, as I said,
I'm now retired, but, um...

43:27.390 --> 43:30.260
In the past few days...

43:30.460 --> 43:35.060
I believe I've been contacted by,
uh, well, him.

43:37.260 --> 43:39.330
I've, uh, received messages

43:39.530 --> 43:42.940
both on my computer and in regular mail.

43:43.140 --> 43:45.140
Now, it could be hoax.

43:45.340 --> 43:46.875
This case garnered a lot of attention.

43:47.075 --> 43:48.610
The nuts keep coming out
of the woodwork.

43:48.810 --> 43:50.540
But the message I received...

43:50.740 --> 43:51.680
He wrote to her, too.

43:51.880 --> 43:54.915
At least, she told me that he did.

43:55.115 --> 43:58.150
Did she report this to the police?

43:58.350 --> 43:59.690
She said she did, yeah.

43:59.890 --> 44:02.020
And?

44:02.220 --> 44:06.030
They said it was
most likely some nut-job

44:06.230 --> 44:08.360
just... just trying to get attention,

44:08.560 --> 44:12.900
and, frankly,
I thought they were probably right.

44:15.100 --> 44:16.170
Do you have the letters?

44:16.370 --> 44:18.940
All of her things
are stored in a warehouse.

44:19.140 --> 44:21.710
Whether or not she kept them,
I don't know.

44:21.910 --> 44:23.850
Still got her computer?

44:24.050 --> 44:27.180
All of it's in the warehouse.

44:27.380 --> 44:31.650
Wh-What kinds of things is
he saying in the messages?

44:31.850 --> 44:34.790
A lot of stuff.

44:34.990 --> 44:37.425
Pretty sick, most of it.

44:37.625 --> 44:40.060
Has suicide come up?

44:40.260 --> 44:42.000
Sorry?

44:46.570 --> 44:51.410
Well,
I-if what my sister told me was true,

44:51.610 --> 44:56.140
he... he was taunting her, uh, to...
to make her feel like

44:56.340 --> 45:02.280
she was partly responsible
for what happened, and...

45:02.480 --> 45:03.820
Encouraging her?

45:04.020 --> 45:08.160
Encouraging her to take her own life,
yeah.

45:09.820 --> 45:13.760
Maybe I will trouble you
for that cup of coffee.

45:15.560 --> 45:18.230
Got some reports to write.
I'll set the alarm.

45:18.430 --> 45:19.970
Cool.

46:08.880 --> 46:12.220
Yeah, baby!

46:12.420 --> 46:14.490
Yeah.

46:22.030 --> 46:23.760
Oh, Jesus! God!

46:23.960 --> 46:26.570
Aah!

46:26.770 --> 46:29.100
Oh, fuck!

46:30.370 --> 46:31.910
God.

46:42.550 --> 46:45.250
Officer.
Sir.

46:45.450 --> 46:48.060
Lou.

46:48.260 --> 46:49.520
What happened?

46:49.720 --> 46:52.130
His computer exploded or something

46:52.330 --> 46:54.200
while he was watching porn.

46:56.400 --> 46:58.670
Alright, alright, alright.

47:01.870 --> 47:04.340
W-What do you mean,
his computer exploded?

47:04.540 --> 47:05.875
I don't know. The microcontroller

47:06.075 --> 47:07.210
on the lithium batteries, if it's...

47:07.410 --> 47:09.880
If there's a defect,
it can overheat and explode.

47:10.080 --> 47:12.080
Yeah. It's happened before,

47:12.280 --> 47:13.650
I read about it.

47:13.850 --> 47:15.220
That's why I hate those
fucking lithium things.

47:15.420 --> 47:17.690
Is he gonna be okay? Yeah.

47:17.890 --> 47:20.690
I mean, yeah. He's gonna be fine.

47:23.820 --> 47:27.630
Fried his brain, watching porn.
Can you believe that?

47:29.160 --> 47:31.970
And we're the ones who are "off."

47:32.170 --> 47:32.770
God.

47:36.840 --> 47:39.910
Do you still have full
access to the police department?

47:40.110 --> 47:42.040
Uh, well, actually, no.

47:42.240 --> 47:46.050
The Department feel I've gone
a bit bat-shit over this case.

47:46.250 --> 47:47.185
Have you?

47:47.385 --> 47:48.320
A little.

47:50.450 --> 47:53.520
Have you shown them
the letter you received?

47:53.720 --> 47:54.820
Not yet, no.

47:55.020 --> 47:56.120
Why not?

47:58.060 --> 48:01.000
I s'pose I lack confidence
that they'll act on it.

48:03.460 --> 48:05.270
Plan to act on it.

48:05.470 --> 48:08.140
I do. Why?

48:08.340 --> 48:11.010
Every cop gets one
they just can't shake.

48:11.210 --> 48:12.440
No matter what.

48:12.640 --> 48:13.870
This is mine.

48:17.210 --> 48:18.810
I want to know.

48:19.010 --> 48:22.150
I want to know
who tormented my sister...

48:22.350 --> 48:24.120
till she killed herself.

48:24.320 --> 48:25.890
Police don't seem to care.

48:26.090 --> 48:29.360
I-I don't think that's necessarily true.

48:29.560 --> 48:32.490
You know it is.

48:33.560 --> 48:37.500
My mother was the only one
who fully believed her.

48:37.700 --> 48:39.930
Where's your mother now?

48:40.700 --> 48:43.370
She's at a place called Sunny Acres.

48:43.570 --> 48:45.110
It's about 30 miles from here.

48:45.310 --> 48:48.240
Would it be possible
for me to speak with her?

48:49.580 --> 48:51.910
She's not always lucid.

48:53.980 --> 48:58.190
But on a good day, yeah.

48:58.390 --> 49:02.190
Let's pray for a good day, then.

49:22.940 --> 49:26.410
<i>When I look out my window</i>

49:28.350 --> 49:31.420
<i>Many sights to see</i>

49:32.620 --> 49:35.960

49:37.830 --> 49:41.530

49:42.160 --> 49:45.970

49:47.170 --> 49:50.500

49:52.440 --> 49:57.180

49:57.380 --> 50:01.850
<i>You got to pick up every stitch</i>

50:02.050 --> 50:06.120
<i>You got to pick up every stitch</i>

50:06.320 --> 50:08.460
<i>Mm-hmm</i>

50:08.660 --> 50:13.790
<i>Must be the season of the witch</i>

50:13.990 --> 50:18.495
<i>Must be the season of the witch, yeah</i>

50:18.695 --> 50:23.200
<i>Must be the season of the witch</i>

50:31.010 --> 50:34.210
<i>When I look over my shoulder</i>

50:35.820 --> 50:37.890
<i>What do you think I see?</i>

50:40.750 --> 50:44.090
<i>Some other cat lookin' over</i>

50:46.230 --> 50:49.660
<i>His shoulder at me</i>

50:50.360 --> 50:53.830
<i>And he's strange</i>

50:54.900 --> 50:58.370
<i>Sure is strange</i>

51:00.570 --> 51:05.050
<i>You got to pick up every stitch</i>

51:05.250 --> 51:08.685
<i>You got to pick up every stitch, yeah</i>

51:08.885 --> 51:12.320
<i>Beatniks are out to make it rich</i>

51:14.190 --> 51:17.260
<i>Oh, no</i>

51:17.460 --> 51:21.460

51:26.230 --> 51:30.600
<i>Must be the season of the witch</i>

51:57.830 --> 52:02.100
<i>You got to pick up every stitch</i>

52:02.300 --> 52:07.040
<i>Two rabbits runnin' in the ditch</i>

52:07.240 --> 52:11.980
<i>Beatniks out to make it rich</i>

52:12.180 --> 52:13.850
<i>Oh, no</i>

52:14.050 --> 52:19.120
<i>Must be the season of the witch</i>

52:19.320 --> 52:23.260

52:23.460 --> 52:29.460
<i>Must be the season of the witch</i>

52:29.660 --> 52:32.470
<i>When I go</i>

52:40.410 --> 52:44.410
<i>When I look out my window</i>

52:46.350 --> 52:49.620
<i>What do you think I see?</i>

52:51.150 --> 52:54.350
<i>And when I look in my window</i>

52:56.160 --> 52:59.690
<i>So many different people to be</i>

52:59.890 --> 53:03.230
