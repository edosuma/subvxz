00:00.712 --> 00:02.380
Previously on Chesapeake Shores:

00:02.547 --> 00:03.627
David and I are over.

00:03.757 --> 00:05.842
- It's not necessarily over.
- It is.

00:06.009 --> 00:09.304
I'm not Martin. Sending in
your manuscript was a mistake.

00:09.471 --> 00:11.222
You know what, I do.

00:11.973 --> 00:14.184
- I love you.
- I love you.

00:15.685 --> 00:17.522
It's great what you two are doing.

00:17.523 --> 00:19.230
My parents still go out on dates too.

00:19.773 --> 00:21.760
I don't know if you're still
in the market for a cook.

00:21.761 --> 00:24.152
I'd like to submit my application.

00:24.319 --> 00:26.321
- Do you have references?
- Just one.

00:26.488 --> 00:28.156
I missed her more than anything.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:39.042 --> 00:40.669
You gonna open that?

00:41.419 --> 00:43.254
I don't know. Think I should?

00:43.421 --> 00:46.383
You went to all the trouble to
bring it in. It might be wise.

00:49.344 --> 00:51.388
By consolidating eight
scripts into seven...

00:51.554 --> 00:54.724
... I now only have
to eliminate six more.

00:55.141 --> 00:57.102
And my brain is mush.

00:57.644 --> 01:01.815
On top of that, Seven-Draft Simon
and I are hosting an authors' series.

01:01.982 --> 01:04.080
Which means we are
spending time together.

01:04.081 --> 01:05.527
I don't know what that means.

01:05.694 --> 01:08.863
If anybody wants to make me feel
better, now would be a good time.

01:09.030 --> 01:13.201
- Seven drafts is better than eight?
- Wrong words.

01:13.368 --> 01:14.536
Okay.

01:14.703 --> 01:17.372
Hey, Gran, breakfast is fantastic.

01:17.539 --> 01:23.169
I didn't do any baking today,
because today is my flower face-off...

01:23.336 --> 01:25.380
... with the beloved Dorothy McNamara.

01:25.547 --> 01:28.299
- You said "beloved" again.
- Oh, indeed I did.

01:28.466 --> 01:30.009
And I meant every word.

01:30.176 --> 01:31.904
But I did nothing with the breakfast.

01:31.905 --> 01:35.557
Two fairies made this
beautiful breakfast.

01:35.724 --> 01:36.766
- What?
- Morning.

01:36.933 --> 01:38.309
- You two made this?
- Yeah.

01:38.476 --> 01:42.188
- Mimi teach you how to make those?
- No, but they look fantastic.

01:42.564 --> 01:44.774
Dad's new girlfriend, Terri, did.

01:44.941 --> 01:48.278
- Dad has a new girlfriend?
- She's a really good cook.

01:48.445 --> 01:51.531
And she's really fun.
And she has a daughter.

01:51.948 --> 01:53.700
When did Dad start dating... ?

01:53.867 --> 01:57.787
I ran out of food at my place. Wow.
It smells delicious in here, Gran.

01:57.954 --> 02:02.500
I had nothing to do with it. And
I need a ride to my flower show...

02:02.667 --> 02:05.670
... because I have to hold
my beautiful flower entry.

02:05.837 --> 02:07.714
Sorry, Gran, I can't.

02:07.922 --> 02:10.826
I have so much research to do

02:10.827 --> 02:12.528
for this case we're
litigating in Baltimore.

02:12.552 --> 02:14.345
Give me 20 minutes, and I'll be ready.

02:14.763 --> 02:17.182
Wha... ? Did I just say
yes? I thought I said no.

02:17.390 --> 02:19.059
- That would be a "yes."
- Oh.

02:19.476 --> 02:20.685
Kevin, can you... ?

02:20.852 --> 02:24.105
No, I'm doing a rotation
in Chesapeake, so I can't.

02:24.606 --> 02:25.732
- Mom?
- Oh, no.

02:25.899 --> 02:28.276
Mick, we're gonna talk
about the mayor's assistant.

02:28.443 --> 02:30.111
Kate Pragnell. Right.

02:30.278 --> 02:31.780
So Denver, San Jose...

02:31.946 --> 02:35.200
... and NYFD, New York's bravest.

02:35.575 --> 02:37.952
At least you're getting closer to home.

02:38.119 --> 02:40.830
Yeah, just not quite close enough.

02:43.166 --> 02:46.336
- Wow. This looks like a killer breakfast.
- Oh!

02:46.503 --> 02:48.922
- Trace!
- Trace, you're back.

02:49.756 --> 02:51.132
How are you, man?

02:51.299 --> 02:52.717
I missed you girls. Ooh.

02:54.344 --> 02:57.055
- When did you get back?
- Late last night.

02:57.222 --> 03:00.558
- Want some breakfast? The girls made it.
- Yes. Definitely

03:57.907 --> 04:00.410
Âª

04:10.128 --> 04:12.008
- You have the coffee?
- Made and poured.

04:12.088 --> 04:14.465
- And the quiches are... ?
- In the oven. Here you go.

04:14.632 --> 04:18.094
- And the... ?
- Croissants ready in... Ding.

04:18.303 --> 04:20.721
Are you okay? It's
great to have you back.

04:20.889 --> 04:24.267
I'm not doing anything. I'm
following you. I can't help.

04:24.434 --> 04:25.560
Right. Sorry.

04:26.352 --> 04:30.231
I got used to doing everything
on my own when you were gone. I...

04:30.440 --> 04:33.109
- You're doing great.
- Really? Thanks.

04:33.276 --> 04:34.485
Here you go.

04:34.652 --> 04:38.323
We can go back to the way things
were, when you did everything.

04:38.489 --> 04:39.782
I wouldn't want that.

04:39.949 --> 04:42.720
Good. I was about to
tell you how I'm amazing,

04:42.721 --> 04:44.370
capable and doing everything.

04:44.537 --> 04:46.289
Jess.

04:46.915 --> 04:49.250
Right. Sorry. Um...

04:49.417 --> 04:52.837
Why don't we divide responsibilities
and share chores... ?

04:53.004 --> 04:56.090
Would you like to go on a
date with me to a restaurant?

04:57.967 --> 04:59.344
Like a real date?

04:59.510 --> 05:00.720
Yeah.

05:03.306 --> 05:05.860
Are you annoyed Wes is
involved with someone new

05:05.861 --> 05:07.020
or that he didn't tell you?

05:07.185 --> 05:10.438
You didn't go out of your way to
let him know we were back together.

05:10.605 --> 05:14.275
Okay, well, it is different
with us because we have history.

05:14.442 --> 05:15.985
I don't know anything about her.

05:16.152 --> 05:20.198
Wes still had to come to terms that
I'd be spending time with his daughters.

05:20.365 --> 05:23.159
I know you probably
think I'm overreacting...

05:23.326 --> 05:26.160
... but I just need to vent a little bit

05:26.161 --> 05:28.873
before I meet Wes' new girlfriend.

05:29.040 --> 05:31.501
- You already called Wes?
- Yeah.

05:31.668 --> 05:34.205
I invited him and Terri
to come out tonight.

05:34.206 --> 05:36.090
I was hoping you could be there.

05:37.465 --> 05:40.635
As much as I would love to meet Terri...

05:40.802 --> 05:43.513
... I have a recording session
in Baltimore this afternoon.

05:43.680 --> 05:46.224
But I'll see you later. I
booked a last-minute gig.

05:46.766 --> 05:50.103
Encore performance for two
sisters, Return of the Snipes.

05:50.269 --> 05:53.272
- Good luck. They're a tough audience.
- You too.

05:53.439 --> 05:56.025
- Let me know how it goes.
- I will. Bye.

05:56.192 --> 05:58.194
- I'll see you tonight.
- Yeah.

06:02.907 --> 06:04.784
Oh, that's nice.

06:10.331 --> 06:12.250
Oh, this will be good.

06:12.959 --> 06:14.293
Oh.

06:15.420 --> 06:16.713
Oh, well.

06:16.879 --> 06:19.215
If it isn't Nell O'Brien.

06:19.382 --> 06:24.846
Oh-ho-ho. And the
beloved Dorothy McNamara.

06:25.013 --> 06:28.391
Well, I can't even begin to describe...

06:28.558 --> 06:31.102
... how it makes me
feel to see you again.

06:31.269 --> 06:33.104
I bet you can't.

06:33.271 --> 06:36.816
Your display is lovely.

06:36.983 --> 06:41.029
- I'm sure that yours will be lovely also.
- Oh, well, I do try.

06:41.195 --> 06:44.824
My late husband was always so proud
of the way I kept our gardens...

06:44.991 --> 06:47.160
- ... and the trophies I won here.
- Uh-huh.

06:47.326 --> 06:49.620
You must've had trouble
finding somewhere...

06:49.787 --> 06:52.874
... for your second-place ribbons.

06:56.335 --> 06:57.795
Ah...

06:58.296 --> 07:02.425
The things I do for you, Gran.
I have a law degree from NYU.

07:02.592 --> 07:05.970
I called in to work and told them
I'm gonna be late because I'm a spy.

07:06.137 --> 07:08.389
Stop complaining and
show me what she brought.

07:08.556 --> 07:13.144
- You could've done this for yourself.
- What? And give her the satisfaction?

07:13.311 --> 07:16.230
- Oh, no. No, no. Never.
- Oh, hi.

07:16.481 --> 07:20.443
- Oh. Okay.
- I did some reconnaissance.

07:20.610 --> 07:23.905
She's got delphinium, purple veronica.

07:24.072 --> 07:27.241
There's nothing out of the
ordinary here, except...

07:28.618 --> 07:31.120
A grown man doing
espionage for his grandma?

07:31.371 --> 07:33.039
Connor.

07:33.456 --> 07:35.291
Why did you become a lawyer?

07:35.833 --> 07:39.253
I'm here to fight for truth,
justice and the American way.

07:39.420 --> 07:40.797
Good.

07:40.963 --> 07:42.173
Because...

07:42.340 --> 07:47.303
... how if I told you that
Miss Dorothy McNamara...

07:47.470 --> 07:49.263
... that she is a...

07:49.430 --> 07:50.723
A cheat.

07:50.890 --> 07:52.475
- Shh.
- Well, now...

07:52.892 --> 07:55.520
... how would that make you feel?

07:55.686 --> 07:57.688
Neither true, just nor American.

07:57.855 --> 08:01.943
Good. Because you're gonna
help me fight for all three.

08:06.823 --> 08:08.915
I think it's a mistake

08:08.916 --> 08:11.197
your school's allowing you to
do a rotation in Chesapeake.

08:11.285 --> 08:12.412
Why?

08:12.578 --> 08:14.747
Because there can be some negatives.

08:14.914 --> 08:18.543
- Didn't the doctor clear you for full duty?
- Yeah. Clean bill of health.

08:18.709 --> 08:21.129
I'm saying there's
some negatives for you.

08:21.295 --> 08:22.730
Lot of maintenance this week.

08:22.731 --> 08:24.924
You'll be doing medical
inventory on the trucks.

08:25.091 --> 08:27.677
- It's okay.
- And trainees always cook.

08:27.844 --> 08:31.264
So don't make your signature
mac and cheese and meatballs.

08:31.431 --> 08:35.643
I wasn't. I learned how to make
this fancy quiche thing at Jess' inn.

08:35.809 --> 08:36.890
- Quiche thing? Wow.
- Yeah.

08:37.019 --> 08:40.940
- Wait, what are the negatives?
- You're gonna have to work with me.

08:41.107 --> 08:42.650
That does sound horrible.

08:42.817 --> 08:47.864
- I can be exacting when it comes to rules.
- I'm going to be able to figure it out.

08:48.030 --> 08:50.324
- That's not the worst of it.
- Hey, hey.

08:50.491 --> 08:52.618
- O'Brien!
- Whoo!

08:53.035 --> 08:54.078
Welcome back.

08:54.662 --> 08:57.748
Yeah.

08:57.915 --> 09:00.418
"For all their swinging and swaying...

09:00.585 --> 09:03.171
... their tired feet
never left the ground."

09:06.966 --> 09:09.010
Thank you, Bree. That was lovely.

09:09.302 --> 09:11.053
Simon, any thoughts?

09:11.220 --> 09:15.433
Honestly, I think that's
some of Bree's very best work.

09:16.851 --> 09:17.852
Thank you.

09:18.019 --> 09:20.732
So, Bree, what prompted your move back

09:20.733 --> 09:22.815
to Chesapeake Shores from Chicago?

09:22.982 --> 09:25.359
Um, a number of reasons, really.

09:25.526 --> 09:27.904
But, um, I had a story to tell.

09:28.070 --> 09:31.199
- And Chicago just wasn't the place.
- Mm-hm.

09:31.407 --> 09:35.369
And, oh, Simon? You are also
pivoting from your Caroline novels...

09:35.536 --> 09:37.663
... with Dublin's Last Sunset.

09:37.830 --> 09:39.832
- Could we hear an excerpt?
- Ooh.

09:39.999 --> 09:41.584
My pleasure.

09:41.751 --> 09:47.798
This is our harrowed lovers'
first parting in wartime Dublin.

09:50.343 --> 09:52.637
"He stood on the curb.

09:52.887 --> 09:54.931
'I'm not Brandon,' he said.

09:55.181 --> 09:57.975
'I don't know Brandon. If
I was to meet Brandon... '"

09:58.142 --> 09:59.560
"Brandon"?

10:01.062 --> 10:02.522
Excuse me?

10:03.940 --> 10:05.566
Oh, uh, I'm so sorry. Uh...

10:05.733 --> 10:08.444
It's... You said "Brandon,"
like Martin Brandon?

10:08.819 --> 10:11.822
Like, the "if you were to meet
him, you would hate him" Brandon?

10:11.989 --> 10:14.450
- Yes, but...
- You said those exact words.

10:14.617 --> 10:18.788
Right, but Brandon is my
Brandon, my fictional Brandon.

10:18.955 --> 10:22.282
Well, you substituted
"Brandon" for "Martin,"

10:22.283 --> 10:25.169
- which doesn't make fiction.
- Art imitates life.

10:25.336 --> 10:29.006
- Okay, but that is not art.
- Is the name Brandon or Martin?

10:29.173 --> 10:30.550
- Brandon.
- Martin.

10:37.723 --> 10:40.142
Connor mentioned you've
been spending time together.

10:40.309 --> 10:41.519
A little bit, yeah.

10:41.686 --> 10:44.105
That's unusual and pretty great.

10:44.272 --> 10:46.065
Yeah, well, things change.

10:46.232 --> 10:47.900
Mm-hm. They do.

10:48.067 --> 10:51.779
I am finally feeling all settled
in my new house and my new job.

10:51.946 --> 10:55.366
Oh, good. How's it going with the kids?

10:55.533 --> 10:57.201
It's getting better.

10:57.368 --> 10:58.661
Well, mostly.

10:58.828 --> 11:01.622
"Getting better mostly" to
the O'Briens is pretty good.

11:01.789 --> 11:03.249
You got a point.

11:03.416 --> 11:07.128
When Jess was in high school, she
wouldn't speak to me for a month...

11:07.295 --> 11:09.589
... because I hadn't
noticed she cut her hair.

11:09.755 --> 11:12.425
- Sure that was the only reason?
- Probably not.

11:12.591 --> 11:15.720
Things were so crazy, I
don't think even she knew why.

11:17.221 --> 11:19.598
- So, Mick...
- Hmm?

11:20.683 --> 11:22.727
... is this a date?

11:23.519 --> 11:25.062
I don't know.

11:36.866 --> 11:39.243
- Hey, Trace.
- Hey.

11:40.202 --> 11:42.580
- I didn't know you played golf.
- I don't.

11:42.747 --> 11:44.123
And I don't fish, bowl...

11:44.290 --> 11:47.293
... and assuming that mat there
is for yoga, do that either.

11:49.003 --> 11:51.547
Mom asked me to stop by
on my way to Baltimore.

11:51.839 --> 11:54.432
She's, uh, afraid
you're getting cold feet

11:54.433 --> 11:57.094
about selling the bank
and finally retiring.

11:58.304 --> 12:02.099
Trace, I built this business
from the ground up, 43 years.

12:02.767 --> 12:05.644
If I'm not running this
bank, then who am I?

12:05.811 --> 12:07.063
Oh, I don't know.

12:07.229 --> 12:10.399
Maybe a husband, a father.

12:11.317 --> 12:12.860
A yogi.

12:13.027 --> 12:14.779
Very funny.

12:15.279 --> 12:16.906
But, Trace...

12:17.490 --> 12:19.950
... I was always there
for you and your mother.

12:20.117 --> 12:23.537
Anything you needed,
this job made it possible.

12:23.954 --> 12:26.415
You might have been there financially.

12:26.582 --> 12:29.585
But you weren't always
there emotionally.

12:31.754 --> 12:35.716
- I needed a father, not a banker.
- Trace, this is who I am.

12:35.883 --> 12:40.054
You don't have a family of your
own yet, so you wouldn't understand.

12:40.554 --> 12:42.390
It's not as easy as you think.

12:42.556 --> 12:44.809
Well, I know Mom misses you.

12:46.435 --> 12:47.603
I'll see you.

12:48.521 --> 12:50.231
See you, son.

12:53.234 --> 12:55.569
- You seem worried.
- I'm not worried.

12:55.736 --> 12:57.863
I know worried, and you are worried.

12:58.030 --> 13:00.199
- Is that why you're here?
- Partially.

13:01.325 --> 13:03.452
I don't really need David anymore.

13:03.619 --> 13:04.620
As a boyfriend?

13:04.787 --> 13:09.583
No, as a cook, a chef,
launderer, handyman.

13:13.379 --> 13:15.798
Dad. Terri.

13:17.049 --> 13:19.427
Hey, you guys. What's going on, huh?

13:20.136 --> 13:22.096
- Oh.
- Hey.

13:22.930 --> 13:25.766
It's good to see you. Muah. Muah.

13:25.933 --> 13:27.935
- I'm gonna go.
- No, please don't.

13:28.102 --> 13:32.231
Nope. You have fun with Mary Poppins.
I got a date with David. See you.

13:32.398 --> 13:35.192
- Hi.
- What has been going on, huh?

13:35.359 --> 13:36.694
- You having fun?
- Yeah.

13:36.861 --> 13:37.862
Good.

13:38.571 --> 13:39.822
- Hey.
- Hi.

13:39.989 --> 13:42.366
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

13:44.326 --> 13:47.580
Tambourines and maracas to
catch snipes. Nice touch.

13:47.746 --> 13:52.126
- Never taken your kids snipe hunting?
- Not yet. My kids are too little.

13:52.293 --> 13:53.293
They'd would just start crying.

13:53.294 --> 13:56.547
It's all about Freddie
the Fish at our house.

13:56.714 --> 14:00.092
- I'm gonna go check on those tracks.
- Sounds good. Thanks.

14:00.634 --> 14:02.301
I can't believe I'm
listening to the two of you

14:02.302 --> 14:04.346
talk about putting kids to bed.

14:04.513 --> 14:07.766
- I can tell you a Freddie the Fish story.
- Pass.

14:07.933 --> 14:10.144
What? That was funny.

14:10.978 --> 14:12.354
You good?

14:12.688 --> 14:14.940
Yeah, yeah. I just, uh...

14:15.107 --> 14:17.693
I had a little thing
with my dad earlier.

14:17.860 --> 14:20.905
You and your old man have always
had a complicated relationship.

14:21.322 --> 14:22.713
I thought we were past it,

14:22.714 --> 14:26.118
but I guess we still have
a few things to work out.

14:27.203 --> 14:28.871
Hey, guys.

14:30.080 --> 14:33.834
Sorry, but our computers just
crashed and wiped out everything.

14:34.001 --> 14:36.295
- We're gonna have to rerecord.
- What?

14:37.046 --> 14:39.632
Can't we can reschedule? Maybe tomorrow?

14:39.799 --> 14:42.968
I'm off to California in the
morning. Mark Hall needs these tracks.

14:43.135 --> 14:46.138
Guys, I gotta go. I promised
Abby's kids I'd see them tonight.

14:46.472 --> 14:49.308
Trace, I don't think we
have that choice, do we?

14:52.895 --> 14:56.273
All right. Just, uh, let me make a call.

15:03.155 --> 15:04.865
Hey, Abby.

15:05.032 --> 15:08.244
Looks like we're not gonna
get out of here for a while.

15:08.410 --> 15:10.579
Can you let the girls
know I can't make it?

15:10.871 --> 15:13.415
Yeah, I'll see you later.

15:13.582 --> 15:15.084
Okay, bye.

15:17.253 --> 15:18.879
Sorry.

15:19.255 --> 15:21.006
Oh, um, ahem...

15:22.341 --> 15:24.901
Your daughters, Abby, they're so smart.

15:24.902 --> 15:26.554
They're really sweet and giving.

15:26.720 --> 15:30.015
And they made Wes and me
these amazing pancakes.

15:30.182 --> 15:31.892
- Would you like one?
- No. Thank you.

15:32.059 --> 15:33.477
I'd love your recipe.

15:33.644 --> 15:36.188
Oh, uh, it's my mother's, probably.

15:36.355 --> 15:39.650
But I'm sure she would
love to give it to you.

15:42.236 --> 15:45.155
Um... Considering you
work in Baltimore...

15:45.322 --> 15:49.159
... I can't imagine how tough
it must be going back and forth.

15:49.660 --> 15:52.580
Yeah, yeah, it is. It is.

15:52.746 --> 15:56.959
But you know what, it reminds me of
this great quote that I read. Um...

15:57.126 --> 15:59.712
Have you heard of the Ms. Marvel blog?

16:02.673 --> 16:04.987
Wes, you don't understand.
It's a great blog.

16:04.988 --> 16:06.051
All of my friends read it.

16:06.218 --> 16:08.637
Every... Anyways.

16:08.804 --> 16:12.683
How does it go? Um... "You put
in the time. You put in the hours.

16:12.850 --> 16:15.311
You tend to the garden,
and you always get flowers."

16:15.477 --> 16:18.397
- I think Terri knows that one too.
- Stop.

16:19.940 --> 16:23.319
So, um, how long have
you two known each other?

16:23.819 --> 16:26.322
We started dating just
over six months ago.

16:26.488 --> 16:30.284
Yeah. We didn't want to complicate
things until we were a couple.

16:30.451 --> 16:34.371
So when Carrie and Caitlyn were
with their dad, I stayed away.

16:35.164 --> 16:37.458
Terri, come see our fairy garden!

16:38.918 --> 16:42.713
Oh, excuse me. I'll be right
back. The coffee is delicious.

16:43.005 --> 16:44.048
Thank you, Abby.

16:49.219 --> 16:54.058
- Well, she... she seems nice.
- And just so you know, she's not a felon.

16:55.017 --> 16:57.645
- Good.
- She runs a large blog from home.

16:58.103 --> 17:00.147
Wow, that's cool. I love blogs.

17:00.314 --> 17:01.440
What's it called?

17:02.107 --> 17:03.692
Actually...

17:03.859 --> 17:05.234
... Terri is Ms. Marvel.

17:05.402 --> 17:06.862
What?

17:07.529 --> 17:08.614
- Yeah.
- What?

17:08.781 --> 17:09.865
Yeah.

17:10.031 --> 17:11.282
What is this?

17:11.450 --> 17:13.786
- This is our fairy garden.
- My goodness.

17:13.953 --> 17:15.329
That's...

17:15.496 --> 17:16.497
That's great.

17:18.123 --> 17:19.750
And, uh...

17:21.085 --> 17:22.502
... I love her.

17:24.213 --> 17:26.382
And I hope you like her too.

17:26.548 --> 17:29.385
Because I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

17:30.970 --> 17:32.304
Wow.

17:32.471 --> 17:34.223
Wes, that's...

17:35.724 --> 17:37.726
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

17:37.893 --> 17:39.561
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

17:39.728 --> 17:41.480
That's just...

17:42.064 --> 17:44.650
So great.

17:50.990 --> 17:52.324
Sorry.

17:54.159 --> 17:56.328
Ugh. The Met just keeps asking me...

17:56.495 --> 17:59.581
... to curate this show
for a hot, new young artist.

17:59.748 --> 18:02.126
- I thought you were done curating?
- I am.

18:02.292 --> 18:05.421
- They just want me to do this one.
- You gonna do it?

18:06.171 --> 18:08.549
- I don't know.
- It would mean going to New York.

18:08.716 --> 18:09.717
Yeah.

18:09.883 --> 18:11.885
Sounds like a wonderful opportunity.

18:12.219 --> 18:15.806
- Not trying to convince me, are you?
- No, I just think it sounds interesting.

18:15.973 --> 18:19.059
- Hmm. It sounds like you are.
- Why would I do that?

18:19.226 --> 18:21.562
Because maybe I'd move back to New York.

18:21.729 --> 18:24.648
Heh. Megan, I'm the one
who brought you here.

18:25.441 --> 18:28.152
But you didn't intend
for me to stay, did you?

18:30.946 --> 18:32.239
I'm sorry.

18:32.406 --> 18:35.576
I shouldn't have said that. I
know you didn't mean that. I, uh...

18:35.743 --> 18:38.662
- Maybe I misunderstood.
- I think maybe you did.

18:41.999 --> 18:45.002
- So how's the Trust development going?
- Great. Really great.

18:48.213 --> 18:49.923
- Hey, honey.
- Hi, Dad.

18:50.090 --> 18:53.135
I just wanted to let you
know that I just offered...

18:53.302 --> 18:58.307
... to host a dinner tomorrow night
for Wes and Terri and her daughter.

18:59.016 --> 19:00.642
Okay.

19:00.976 --> 19:03.353
And, um...

19:03.520 --> 19:07.191
... Wes is also getting engaged.

19:08.067 --> 19:09.401
Wow.

19:09.568 --> 19:12.154
- Are you okay with that?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

19:12.321 --> 19:13.906
I'm just, uh...

19:14.740 --> 19:15.991
... processing.

19:16.158 --> 19:18.118
But we will talk later.

19:18.494 --> 19:21.163
- Wes is getting engaged.
- What?

19:21.330 --> 19:24.500
I'll tell your mother. She'll
probably wanna start cooking today.

19:24.666 --> 19:26.752
Thank you. Bye.

19:37.638 --> 19:39.389
She's gone.

19:39.848 --> 19:43.310
Look, Gran, no offense,
but why does this matter?

19:43.477 --> 19:45.813
You've lost to Dorothy
for, what, 15 years now?

19:45.979 --> 19:48.774
Well, I don't mind losing
to Dorothy McNamara.

19:48.941 --> 19:51.735
But I don't like losing to a cheat.

19:51.902 --> 19:55.405
Rule 23-A says that
all flowers and fauna...

19:55.572 --> 19:58.992
... has to be come from within
the boundaries of Maryland.

19:59.326 --> 20:00.494
Stop.

20:00.661 --> 20:03.497
Oh, Connor, there it is.

20:03.664 --> 20:06.708
The coast is clear. Here.

20:13.298 --> 20:14.508
Oh...

20:15.634 --> 20:17.594
"The Middlemist camellia."

20:17.761 --> 20:19.429
There's only two.

20:19.596 --> 20:21.557
One in New Zealand.

20:21.723 --> 20:25.060
And the other is in a
greenhouse in Britain.

20:26.478 --> 20:29.565
- Do you know what this means?
- I do.

20:30.440 --> 20:32.776
I'm gonna call the police
and have her arrested.

20:32.943 --> 20:36.822
Dorothy will spend the rest of
her days gardening in Alcatraz.

20:36.989 --> 20:39.533
You don't take any of
this seriously, do you?

20:39.700 --> 20:41.326
Gran, I am insulted.

20:41.493 --> 20:44.997
The fate of the free world
hinges on what happens here today.

20:45.164 --> 20:47.499
Remember when you were only 8 years old?

20:47.666 --> 20:51.378
And you were so sick with the
flu. You looked up at me and said:

20:51.545 --> 20:54.965
"Gran, you'll always be
there for me, won't you?"

20:55.132 --> 20:57.426
And I'll always be there for you."

20:57.593 --> 21:00.596
- And I said, "Do you mean it?"
- "Do you mean it?"

21:00.762 --> 21:03.015
- And you said...
- Fine.

21:03.182 --> 21:05.184
What do you want me to do?

21:06.560 --> 21:09.646
And I really wasn't thinking.

21:10.189 --> 21:12.566
I just was very upset with your parents.

21:12.733 --> 21:16.403
And I wanted to speak my mind, so I did.

21:16.820 --> 21:18.572
It was great.

21:18.947 --> 21:21.450
After I went back inside...

21:21.742 --> 21:23.911
... Alexandra was talking to them.

21:24.077 --> 21:26.872
And when I found out what
happened, I joined in.

21:27.039 --> 21:28.498
You did?

21:28.790 --> 21:31.710
- I'm so sorry for what happened.
- No, it's okay.

21:33.962 --> 21:37.132
You know, I think that they
might have been sorry too.

21:37.299 --> 21:38.592
Might be?

21:38.759 --> 21:41.094
They didn't deny that they were wrong...

21:41.261 --> 21:44.431
... which is about as close
as it gets with my parents.

21:44.681 --> 21:46.850
Were they upset when you left?

21:47.017 --> 21:48.352
I don't know.

21:49.228 --> 21:52.522
They told Alexandra that
she's running the company now.

21:52.689 --> 21:54.816
And then, um...

21:55.484 --> 21:59.613
... before I said goodbye, I made
them dinner, this six-course meal.

21:59.780 --> 22:01.907
I pulled out all the stops.

22:02.074 --> 22:03.450
And?

22:04.034 --> 22:06.203
And my dad got up.

22:06.370 --> 22:10.666
And he walked away from the
table. And he didn't say a word.

22:11.583 --> 22:13.418
I'm sorry.

22:18.715 --> 22:21.510
- How'd it go with Wes and Terri?
- Uh, heh.

22:23.220 --> 22:24.846
Well, uh...

22:25.681 --> 22:28.642
... have you heard me
talk about Ms. Marvel?

22:28.809 --> 22:30.227
Yeah, I think so.

22:30.394 --> 22:32.396
It's like a cooking blog, right?

22:32.854 --> 22:36.858
Close. It's about, uh, being
the perfect single parent.

22:37.025 --> 22:38.193
Okay.

22:39.444 --> 22:42.155
Well, it...

22:43.198 --> 22:46.994
... turns out that Ms. Marvel...

22:47.202 --> 22:48.912
... is Terri Ingram.

22:50.789 --> 22:53.792
Yeah, and she's even
more perfect in person.

22:53.959 --> 22:56.503
And Wes is going to propose.

22:57.045 --> 23:00.257
Wow. I missed all that?

23:01.133 --> 23:03.051
Well, that had to be tough.

23:03.552 --> 23:05.137
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

23:05.303 --> 23:07.389
Yeah, it was.

23:08.015 --> 23:12.019
But, uh, Terri is great,
and the girls like her, so...

23:12.185 --> 23:14.563
And that's what's most important, right?

23:14.730 --> 23:16.148
Right.

23:18.900 --> 23:20.277
Come here.

23:25.449 --> 23:28.326
Hey. Thanks for coming
in so early, Mick.

23:28.493 --> 23:31.872
I was hoping to get these loan
documents signed and ready.

23:32.039 --> 23:33.790
No problem.

23:36.001 --> 23:39.588
So, um, how's your dad doing
with the selling of the bank?

23:40.422 --> 23:41.757
I think he'll be okay.

23:41.923 --> 23:43.633
He might take up yoga.

23:44.051 --> 23:46.178
That's something I'd like to see.

23:46.344 --> 23:49.765
Or maybe not. He's a good man, your dad.

23:49.931 --> 23:52.559
He spent more than half his
life building up that bank.

23:53.060 --> 23:55.145
That's quite an accomplishment.

23:55.312 --> 23:57.022
Yeah, it is.

23:57.189 --> 23:59.566
Yeah, but after 43 years...

23:59.733 --> 24:01.985
... what's left to accomplish?

24:02.277 --> 24:05.155
I've asked myself that
same question many times.

24:06.823 --> 24:08.283
- Hey, Mick.
- Hmm?

24:08.825 --> 24:11.953
You ever regret missing stuff
when your kids were growing up?

24:12.579 --> 24:14.790
Oh, yeah, all the time.

24:15.415 --> 24:18.877
I used to tell myself that
I needed to be away working...

24:19.044 --> 24:20.962
... building, being a provider.

24:21.296 --> 24:22.798
And now?

24:23.090 --> 24:25.467
Now I realize...

24:25.842 --> 24:29.805
... that the measure of a man's
success is not what he has...

24:29.971 --> 24:32.211
... but who he has to
truly share it with.

24:32.212 --> 24:33.892
You know, Mick, I like
our little talks. e

24:39.272 --> 24:40.732
Me too.

24:44.236 --> 24:46.947
- There you go.
- I'll sign.

24:49.533 --> 24:51.326
Watch this.

24:51.493 --> 24:54.287
- Look at me.
- Whoo! Good job.

24:54.454 --> 24:58.041
Hey, Mom, watch this. I got
a new twist on my handstand.

25:00.001 --> 25:01.253
Ooh, that's good.

25:01.586 --> 25:05.298
- I'm still working on it.
- You'll get it. I have no doubt.

25:05.799 --> 25:09.636
- Terri's nice, isn't she?
- Yeah, she likes to sing Beatles songs.

25:09.803 --> 25:11.346
Wow.

25:11.721 --> 25:14.224
What do you, um, think of her with Dad?

25:14.391 --> 25:15.809
It's okay.

25:15.976 --> 25:18.937
- Dad already asked us that.
- What's that?

25:19.104 --> 25:21.565
If we were okay with him marrying Terri.

25:21.731 --> 25:23.024
Oh. Uh, what did you say?

25:23.191 --> 25:24.568
Sure. Watch this.

25:24.734 --> 25:27.779
Three, two, one. Split. Ta-da!

25:27.946 --> 25:29.406
Whoa.

25:31.324 --> 25:34.035
That's really good.

25:34.786 --> 25:39.124
I didn't write actual conversations
replacing "Martin" with "Brandon."

25:39.291 --> 25:41.710
The fact is, the conversation
didn't belong to you.

25:41.877 --> 25:45.589
But it was our conversation.
I have 50 percent custody.

25:46.298 --> 25:48.800
Okay, I have a question for you.

25:48.967 --> 25:52.929
Your family members that read your
book, they recognize themselves?

25:53.096 --> 25:56.099
- A few.
- Then what's the difference?

25:56.266 --> 25:57.267
Well...

25:57.434 --> 26:01.104
I mean, Bree, we all write
what we know. That's what we do.

26:01.271 --> 26:03.290
I turned you into a painter in Ireland

26:03.291 --> 26:05.525
and you turned me into Wallace...

26:05.692 --> 26:08.528
... a marine biologist
with a flounder obsession.

26:08.695 --> 26:10.572
It's my favorite fish.

26:10.739 --> 26:12.741
Well, that is sweet.

26:13.033 --> 26:15.333
But in real life, I happen to be

26:15.334 --> 26:17.662
terribly allergic to
seafood of all varieties.

26:17.829 --> 26:20.207
One taste and I puff up like a blowfish.

26:20.373 --> 26:24.419
Oh, that is so tragic and
wonderfully ironic at the same time.

26:24.586 --> 26:29.674
- I have to use that in my book.
- Well, thank you and you're welcome.

26:34.095 --> 26:35.263
What are we doing?

26:36.806 --> 26:39.184
Simon, what are you really doing here?

26:39.768 --> 26:42.520
I suppose you won't
completely buy me saying...

26:42.687 --> 26:45.482
... I'm a good Samaritan who
helps novelists in distress.

26:45.649 --> 26:47.025
No.

26:47.192 --> 26:49.027
Because I'm not in distress.

26:50.862 --> 26:54.491
I kind of want an answer without
all the cleverness attached.

26:57.285 --> 26:59.037
The truth is...

27:00.080 --> 27:03.416
... I wanted to come back,
but I didn't know how to do it.

27:03.583 --> 27:05.001
And I love your novel.

27:05.377 --> 27:07.879
So volunteering to edit it...

27:08.797 --> 27:11.633
... was my lame excuse to see you.

27:13.218 --> 27:16.137
Well, sometimes "lame" can be...

27:16.304 --> 27:19.683
- Brilliant?
- Not so lame.

27:21.184 --> 27:22.477
Okay.

27:24.938 --> 27:27.796
Now, how exactly did Gran
get you to spy for her?

27:27.797 --> 27:30.927
- I'm guessing she brought up the flu?
- The flu?

27:30.944 --> 27:34.030
- I say love. Love works.
- Agreed.

27:34.197 --> 27:36.116
I'm going with Gran. That was why.

27:36.283 --> 27:41.079
No, Connor had the most disgusting
flu, and Gran took care of him.

27:41.246 --> 27:44.708
And she's been working
that guilt for 20 years.

27:46.084 --> 27:50.338
- It was a really gross flu.
- Trace, can we go snipe hunting tonight?

27:50.505 --> 27:53.925
- I would love to, but...
- Girls, Trace has to, um, work.

27:54.092 --> 27:55.844
He's got a gig in D.C.

27:56.386 --> 27:59.139
- Maybe we can go.
- And we can send him a video.

27:59.306 --> 28:01.016
- Yeah, send me a video.
- Sure.

28:01.182 --> 28:04.269
You cannot write about any
of this in your next book.

28:04.436 --> 28:08.106
- I wouldn't dream of it.
- Hey, you're not writing about us too.

28:08.273 --> 28:10.984
- Wait, wait, who's writing about who?
- Not me.

28:11.151 --> 28:15.363
I got to set the record straight,
okay? I was not guilted into it.

28:15.530 --> 28:19.743
Gran can attest. I did it for
truth, justice and the American way.

28:21.953 --> 28:25.248
- Hey. Hey.
- Way to go, Superman. Way to go.

28:25.832 --> 28:27.834
Okay, is everybody here?

28:28.001 --> 28:30.545
I'd like to make a toast.

28:30.712 --> 28:32.570
I'd just like to say that, um,

28:32.571 --> 28:35.633
over the years, this
table has gotten larger...

28:35.800 --> 28:37.927
... it's gotten small.
Now it's large again.

28:38.094 --> 28:41.390
That's a testament to this family

28:41.391 --> 28:43.031
and the love that we
have for one another.

28:43.433 --> 28:46.895
And tonight, we have some very
special guests at the table.

28:47.062 --> 28:50.106
And we'd like to, uh, pass
that love on to you guys.

28:50.273 --> 28:53.693
And so may you always be healthy.

28:53.860 --> 28:57.989
And may your home always be too
small to hold all of your friends.

28:58.156 --> 29:00.909
- Cheers.
- We love you. Thanks.

29:01.618 --> 29:03.620
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

29:04.329 --> 29:05.747
Cheers.

29:09.042 --> 29:10.919
Come on.

29:11.086 --> 29:14.547
When I was young, I decided
to only read dead authors.

29:14.714 --> 29:15.965
I love dead authors.

29:16.132 --> 29:17.300
Yes, me too.

29:17.467 --> 29:20.107
I read them because I
knew once I'd consumed

29:20.108 --> 29:21.428
everything that they'd written...

29:21.513 --> 29:25.308
... I'd never have to worry about
missing their next great work.

29:25.725 --> 29:27.811
That seems logical.

29:28.186 --> 29:30.438
- It's also kind of sad.
- Yeah.

29:32.357 --> 29:36.069
Bree, I love your writing.

29:37.153 --> 29:38.738
But more than that...

29:41.074 --> 29:42.867
... I like you.

29:43.993 --> 29:46.121
And I don't want to give that up.

29:48.748 --> 29:51.334
This feel like we're
gonna have the, um...

29:51.793 --> 29:54.087
Like, the "what are we" talk?

29:54.254 --> 29:55.338
Yeah.

29:55.505 --> 29:57.507
Yeah, I need to ask the question.

29:57.674 --> 29:59.092
Um...

29:59.426 --> 30:03.263
You could just keep making
excuses to come visit me.

30:04.514 --> 30:08.935
You know, I think now is the
moment I ask you not to be clever.

30:09.352 --> 30:13.064
Yeah, it's easier to be clever
than it is to be vulnerable.

30:14.149 --> 30:15.275
Cleverly said.

30:16.443 --> 30:17.944
Right.

30:19.654 --> 30:21.156
Okay.

30:22.282 --> 30:25.034
Okay, well, let's
just, uh... Let's talk.

30:27.662 --> 30:29.164
Good.

30:30.415 --> 30:34.043
- I really want to dislike her.
- She's pretty hard to dislike.

30:34.252 --> 30:35.876
I just never thought about

30:35.877 --> 30:38.465
having to share my
children with anyone else.

30:38.631 --> 30:42.969
And I know that Wes has
had to accept Trace, but...

30:45.096 --> 30:49.017
But you never thought about
another woman raising your children.

30:49.184 --> 30:51.603
Hmm. No.

30:53.521 --> 30:56.399
And what is wonderful...

30:56.566 --> 30:59.486
... and horrible, is that...

31:01.404 --> 31:03.740
... Carrie and Caitlyn are okay with it.

31:03.907 --> 31:05.325
They're even happy.

31:05.950 --> 31:09.496
- That's what I want for them, but...
- Of course you do.

31:09.704 --> 31:11.956
That's the most important thing.

31:13.041 --> 31:17.420
Even in my worst moments,
I knew you had Gran.

31:20.089 --> 31:23.009
And that was wonderful...

31:23.384 --> 31:24.928
... and horrible too.

31:25.637 --> 31:26.888
Mom...

31:32.477 --> 31:34.020
Yeah. Ahem.

31:37.816 --> 31:39.150
- Gran.
- Hmm.

31:39.734 --> 31:43.071
- I found what you're looking for.
- The smoking gun?

31:43.571 --> 31:46.449
More like a flowering one.

31:46.616 --> 31:49.118
I canvassed some flower stores.

31:49.285 --> 31:51.079
And I managed to find out...

31:51.246 --> 31:52.831
Don't ask.

31:53.081 --> 31:55.708
... that Dorothy has
been importing flowers...

31:55.875 --> 31:58.294
... including one Middlemist
camellia from England.

31:58.628 --> 32:00.505
I knew she was cheating.

32:00.672 --> 32:04.509
She's been doing it for years.
Here is what I couldn't figure out.

32:04.676 --> 32:06.940
She's paying for them in installments.

32:06.941 --> 32:09.350
Some of them are still outstanding.

32:09.514 --> 32:11.474
What do you mean installments?

32:11.641 --> 32:13.393
Dorothy's well-off.

32:13.560 --> 32:16.479
That's what I thought, so
I did a little research.

32:16.646 --> 32:20.275
And it turns out, after
Dorothy's husband died...

32:21.067 --> 32:22.730
... she hasn't had
a stable place to live

32:22.731 --> 32:25.490
or a place to grow her own flowers.

32:25.655 --> 32:27.907
- What?
- Gran, I think that the...

32:28.074 --> 32:31.077
The facade of the flower show...

32:31.244 --> 32:33.830
... it might be pretty
much all she has left.

32:33.997 --> 32:36.708
Facade, indeed.

32:36.875 --> 32:40.503
Well, I mean, cheating is
cheating, but at least now we know.

32:44.591 --> 32:47.135
When I hang out with your
family, I think about how...

32:47.302 --> 32:49.220
How crazy we are.

32:49.387 --> 32:52.140
I was gonna say how wonderful you are.

32:52.307 --> 32:55.268
I guess we're kind of
wonderful too, sometimes.

32:55.435 --> 32:58.646
Your dad and Connor are talking
again. That's really nice.

32:58.813 --> 32:59.939
Yeah.

33:00.106 --> 33:02.442
I guess it is.

33:03.109 --> 33:06.237
I just mean you guys seem
to get over things quickly.

33:06.404 --> 33:09.032
Only when we throw them under the rug.

33:09.449 --> 33:12.035
But you and Alexandra,
you guys seem okay.

33:13.620 --> 33:14.871
Yeah.

33:15.038 --> 33:18.499
My family excels at seeming.

33:18.917 --> 33:21.920
But we're never even
close to being okay.

33:36.559 --> 33:38.394
You having fun yet?

33:38.603 --> 33:42.482
Uh, actually, yeah.

33:42.649 --> 33:45.985
No one got hurt. All that's
left is cooking dinner.

33:46.152 --> 33:50.031
Good thing you're a paramedic,
because your cooking might kill us all.

33:52.450 --> 33:53.785
What?

33:55.370 --> 33:58.748
- Nothing.
- No, there's something.

33:58.915 --> 34:01.709
When you stop smiling,
there's always something.

34:02.543 --> 34:06.547
All right, it's just... I've only
gotten three job offers so far.

34:07.256 --> 34:11.052
- Denver, San Jose and New York.
- Oh.

34:11.260 --> 34:14.347
I've applied to every department
within a hundred miles of here...

34:14.514 --> 34:16.724
... but so far, nothing close by.

34:17.016 --> 34:19.768
Well, I'm sure you'll
hear something soon.

34:21.728 --> 34:23.398
I just, uh...

34:24.148 --> 34:26.150
I like being here with you.

34:28.027 --> 34:30.112
Yeah, it's been okay.

34:30.989 --> 34:31.989
Come on.

34:32.407 --> 34:35.618
If you're nice, I'll let you
help me roll up the hoses.

34:43.042 --> 34:45.753
I've been thinking about yesterday.

34:46.087 --> 34:47.797
At Sally's?

34:48.505 --> 34:50.466
Yeah, me too.

34:52.385 --> 34:53.886
It felt, um...

34:55.304 --> 34:58.391
- ... familiar.
- Mm-hm.

34:59.100 --> 35:00.601
Unfortunately.

35:00.768 --> 35:04.272
I guess we haven't changed
as much as we thought we had.

35:04.439 --> 35:05.857
Hmm.

35:08.401 --> 35:11.863
Do you ever wonder what
might've happened... ?

35:12.447 --> 35:13.948
If?

35:14.490 --> 35:16.284
Yeah, if.

35:17.785 --> 35:19.620
We had some good times.

35:19.787 --> 35:20.913
Yes, we did.

35:22.832 --> 35:25.585
I'm just not sure I'm
over the other stuff.

35:26.169 --> 35:27.795
Same here.

35:28.588 --> 35:30.381
It's kind of like...

35:32.300 --> 35:35.553
... so much water under the bridge...

35:37.555 --> 35:40.141
... that maybe the
bridge has washed away.

35:42.935 --> 35:45.980
Think there's any chance
we could rebuild it?

35:48.066 --> 35:51.310
I think that maybe

35:51.311 --> 35:54.490
this is a chance for us to
build something different.

35:54.697 --> 35:56.699
Like that old boat you're building?

35:59.952 --> 36:02.205
- Ah. So you know about that, huh?
- Mm-hm.

36:04.707 --> 36:08.961
I'm just glad that you found something
that makes you so happy, Mick.

36:09.128 --> 36:11.130
Well, thank you, Megan.

36:12.340 --> 36:14.008
So am I.

36:43.246 --> 36:45.790
Hi, Trace. We're looking for snipes.

36:45.957 --> 36:47.208
Dad saw one, but it got away.

36:47.375 --> 36:49.043
We miss you.

36:49.335 --> 36:50.878
Wish you were here.

37:03.516 --> 37:06.894
And second place goes to Nell O'Brien...

37:07.061 --> 37:11.315
... for her traditional mass
display, "Summertime Fugue."

37:12.275 --> 37:13.609
Love you, Gran.

37:13.776 --> 37:16.571
Thank you so much. Appreciate you.

37:16.737 --> 37:18.114
Okay.

37:18.614 --> 37:22.410
And first place, for
the 16th year in a row...

37:22.577 --> 37:25.496
... goes to Dorothy
McNamara for "Gilded Lilies."

37:27.248 --> 37:29.208
Come on up, Dorothy.

37:29.917 --> 37:31.627
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

37:31.794 --> 37:34.881
- Well done.
- Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

37:45.975 --> 37:48.936
Dorothy, could I talk
to you for just a minute?

37:49.103 --> 37:52.106
Of course. I always have
time for you, my dear Nell.

37:52.273 --> 37:58.321
Listen, I was thinking that we
might go and have lunch together.

37:58.487 --> 38:00.823
Because after 16 years...

38:01.490 --> 38:04.035
... heh, maybe it's time, you know?

38:04.202 --> 38:06.996
It's not the trophies or the ribbons...

38:07.163 --> 38:11.000
... it's the friendships
that are the true rewards.

38:15.129 --> 38:17.757
I can't agree more.

38:22.803 --> 38:25.223
You can go to work now.

38:31.145 --> 38:32.313
Huh.

38:45.201 --> 38:48.162
The last three days have
been the best of my life.

38:48.663 --> 38:50.263
We really didn't do anything special.

38:50.264 --> 38:53.417
It's just that it wasn't
special. It was just...

38:54.835 --> 38:58.506
- ... the way that I thought it would feel.
- For me too.

38:59.131 --> 39:01.884
Which is why I just
don't want it to end.

39:02.802 --> 39:04.470
Yeah.

39:06.973 --> 39:09.350
- I'll do the scones.
- I'll do the quiche.

39:09.517 --> 39:12.478
- I love your quiche.
- I love your scones.

39:12.645 --> 39:15.314
- And you wash. I'll dry.
- And we'll both fold.

39:15.481 --> 39:18.776
- Deal. See? We make a great team.
- Yes, we do.

39:21.195 --> 39:24.573
- I always knew I wanted to be a writer.
- Not me.

39:24.740 --> 39:27.368
I always fancied myself a rock star.

39:27.535 --> 39:30.830
Hmm. You realize by saying
things like "fancied myself"...

39:31.038 --> 39:33.916
... you could never,
ever become a rock star.

39:34.083 --> 39:36.919
Yeah. Not to mention the
fact that I'm tone deaf.

39:37.086 --> 39:40.423
But you know what? I still
haven't given up hope.

39:40.589 --> 39:42.675
- Still think about it.
- Ha. Really?

39:42.967 --> 39:46.053
Yeah, sadly. That and American football.

39:46.220 --> 39:50.433
Quarterback. I still hope that one
day, I'll finally be discovered.

39:50.599 --> 39:52.535
So you are a tone-deaf,

39:52.536 --> 39:56.731
failed rock-star quarterback
who's afraid of flounder.

39:56.897 --> 39:58.649
Yeah, pretty much.

39:58.816 --> 40:00.901
Which is why I became a novelist.

40:01.068 --> 40:04.196
It's far easier to
pretend to be someone else.

40:05.072 --> 40:08.284
This "pretend" you, um...

40:08.451 --> 40:10.536
... has he ever sold cars?

40:10.786 --> 40:12.330
I don't understand.

40:12.496 --> 40:16.459
Well, as you may recall, I'm
in the market for a new one.

40:16.876 --> 40:18.252
Right.

40:18.419 --> 40:20.671
- Maybe British.
- Okay.

40:20.838 --> 40:22.631
Maybe a muscle car.

40:22.798 --> 40:25.468
Something adaptable to
all kinds of terrain...

40:25.634 --> 40:28.846
... and can fit a few
spirited family members.

40:29.013 --> 40:30.681
Ah. Interesting.

40:30.848 --> 40:33.500
I don't suppose you'd be
willing to give up one,

40:33.501 --> 40:35.686
two items on your wish list?

40:35.853 --> 40:39.440
Heh. I don't know. I,
uh, haven't decided yet.

40:39.607 --> 40:41.185
Well, when you do finally decide

40:41.186 --> 40:46.155
to purchase a slightly
used British car...

40:46.405 --> 40:48.074
... give me a call.

40:49.742 --> 40:52.995
- You're going?
- I have a talk at UCLA next week.

40:53.162 --> 40:56.582
I either intend to talk
about contemporary fiction...

40:56.749 --> 41:00.044
... or the state of the
British automobile industry.

41:00.503 --> 41:02.463
You are way too clever
for your own good.

41:02.630 --> 41:04.548
- Bree?
- Yeah.

41:05.758 --> 41:07.093
I like you.

41:08.302 --> 41:11.389
And there's really only
one clever thing left to do.

41:11.555 --> 41:15.059
And it doesn't involve words.

41:27.863 --> 41:29.365
Mm-hm.

41:32.076 --> 41:33.536
Mm-hm.

41:41.085 --> 41:43.170
Ahem. Cheerio.

41:45.923 --> 41:48.092
Mom said you were still here.

41:48.426 --> 41:50.136
Last day.

41:51.095 --> 41:52.930
Which I'm okay with.

41:53.514 --> 41:55.182
I think it's time.

41:57.059 --> 42:00.187
Not sure the banking industry
really needs me anymore.

42:00.354 --> 42:02.106
Maybe not.

42:02.398 --> 42:06.152
I wanted you to know I understand
how hard this must be for you.

42:08.696 --> 42:11.782
There's a baseball game coming up.

42:11.949 --> 42:14.201
I thought maybe we could go together.

42:15.578 --> 42:17.913
They're on the third baseline.

42:19.415 --> 42:21.876
The Nationals have a
good team this year.

42:22.042 --> 42:23.794
Yeah, they do.

42:25.880 --> 42:27.673
You know, you were right.

42:28.048 --> 42:31.010
I don't know exactly what
it means to be a father.

42:31.594 --> 42:34.013
But I'm trying to figure it out.

42:37.016 --> 42:38.976
I think you'll be okay.

42:41.061 --> 42:44.565
- Wanna give me a hand with this stuff?
- Sure.

42:44.732 --> 42:46.025
Thanks.

43:06.754 --> 43:07.963
Hello, sailor.

43:09.006 --> 43:10.299
- Hey.
- Hey.

43:11.675 --> 43:14.094
- Permission to come aboard, sir?
- Granted.

43:14.386 --> 43:15.930
Thank you.

43:16.347 --> 43:18.140
Oh, wow.

43:18.307 --> 43:19.808
Mick.

43:20.476 --> 43:22.186
I love her.

43:25.564 --> 43:27.608
This is where you've
been bringing Connor.

43:27.775 --> 43:29.818
He's been helping me
put her back together.

43:29.985 --> 43:34.073
- Thank you for inviting me to meet her.
- I just, uh...

43:34.240 --> 43:36.784
I wanted to share this with you.

43:37.785 --> 43:39.954
It's an old Roman tradition.

43:40.120 --> 43:43.541
When you step the mast on a sailboat,
you slide a coin underneath it...

43:43.707 --> 43:47.419
... for good luck and protection.

43:47.670 --> 43:49.797
So tomorrow...

43:49.964 --> 43:53.634
... I've got a crane
coming to re-step the mast.

43:54.802 --> 43:55.886
So...

43:57.012 --> 44:00.516
So is there a ceremony,
or special toast?

44:00.683 --> 44:02.977
Or some obscure words of wisdom?

44:03.143 --> 44:05.521
No. This is it.

44:05.688 --> 44:09.942
Just a way to share the boat with
those that you've sailed with before.

44:13.737 --> 44:14.905
Hm

44:15.823 --> 44:18.242
- I'll drink to that.
- Me too.

44:22.913 --> 44:25.416
- Come on. I'll show you the boat.
- I can't wait.

44:25.583 --> 44:27.501
Watch your step, watch your drink.

44:29.211 --> 44:31.672
Okay, let's go.

44:31.839 --> 44:33.090
Come on.

44:33.257 --> 44:36.051
Wes, the girls have gymnastics
Wednesday and Friday.

44:36.218 --> 44:38.929
I know. And Terri has it written down.

44:41.599 --> 44:44.101
Thank you for coming. I'm
glad we were able to meet.

44:44.268 --> 44:45.686
Me too.

44:45.894 --> 44:47.521
Abby, I...

44:47.771 --> 44:50.190
I don't think this is
supposed to be easy.

44:51.817 --> 44:53.694
No. No, it's...

44:53.861 --> 44:56.488
It's not, but we'll see how it goes.

44:56.655 --> 44:58.866
Yeah. Uh...

45:04.038 --> 45:05.622
- Okay.
- Bye.

45:05.789 --> 45:07.041
Bye.

45:09.168 --> 45:12.254
- Have fun at Dad's, girls.
- Bye, Mom.

46:00.552 --> 46:02.179
Next week on Chesapeake Shores:

46:02.346 --> 46:03.931
You've been running this in absentia.

46:04.098 --> 46:05.224
Now we do it my way.

46:05.391 --> 46:08.727
- Mom and Dad should encourage you.
- They're setting me to fail.

46:08.894 --> 46:11.772
- We'll be accepting your resignation.
- My what?

46:11.939 --> 46:14.608
- You don't have a case.
- This doesn't sound like you.

46:14.775 --> 46:16.693
This is me gunning for a partnership.

46:16.694 --> 46:18.840
What would you say if I
took a job in Philadelphia?

46:19.041 --> 46:20.141
What?
