Portside.

00:52.261 --> 00:54.253
There is something in the water!

00:56.265 --> 00:58.598
Pull it up, you lazy dogs! Come on!

00:58.934 --> 01:00.470
Come on, pull it up!

01:08.277 --> 01:09.893
Be careful.

01:12.155 --> 01:14.021
What do we have here?

01:21.123 --> 01:23.786
Hey, Captain, look at this!

01:44.730 --> 01:46.346
Where are you coming from?

01:46.773 --> 01:50.437
That old boat will definitely
pay us a fortune for you,

01:50.777 --> 01:52.063
right, boys?

02:12.132 --> 02:16.923
JIM BUTTON
AND LUKE THE ENGINE DRIVER

02:25.312 --> 02:28.476
<i>The land where Luke
the engine driver lived</i>

02:28.899 --> 02:30.561
<i>was called Morrowland.</i>

02:30.901 --> 02:32.187
<i>It was tiny.</i>

02:32.611 --> 02:36.321
<i>It consisted mainly
of two mountain tops.</i>

02:36.823 --> 02:40.362
<i>A tall one and a smaller one.</i>

02:40.744 --> 02:42.986
<i>Of course, there were houses
in Morrowland, as well.</i>

02:43.372 --> 02:47.366
<i>A normal one,
and one with a shop.</i>

02:47.959 --> 02:52.124
<i>Furthermore, there was a little train
station at the foot of the mountain.</i>

02:52.839 --> 02:55.832
<i>And high above, between the two peaks,</i>

02:56.218 --> 02:57.629
<i>there was a castle.</i>

03:00.263 --> 03:03.506
<i>Life was peaceful on the small
island of Morrowland</i>

03:04.226 --> 03:05.683
<i>until one day...</i>

03:06.144 --> 03:10.263
<i>Yes, and this is how
our story begins.</i>

03:10.565 --> 03:12.477
A package from the Wild 13.

03:12.901 --> 03:15.268
Does a certain
Mrs. Grindtooth live here?

03:15.779 --> 03:18.146
Mrs. what?
- Mrs. Whaat? That's me.

03:18.448 --> 03:20.861
You are Mrs. Grindtooth?
- I am Mrs. Whaat.

03:21.201 --> 03:24.285
Mrs. Grindtooth?
- Make way for His Majesty!

03:28.375 --> 03:30.708
Could it be a subject

03:31.044 --> 03:32.455
who doesn't pay taxes?

03:39.261 --> 03:40.718
We'll never know what's inside

03:41.054 --> 03:43.171
or to whom it belongs
if we don't open it.

03:50.689 --> 03:52.225
Holy cow!

03:52.607 --> 03:54.223
What is that, Your Majesty?

03:54.526 --> 03:56.859
Indeed, what is it?

03:57.779 --> 03:59.520
This might as well be

03:59.906 --> 04:03.240
the prettiest parcel
I have seen in my entire life!

04:03.577 --> 04:04.784
How mean!

04:06.079 --> 04:07.820
If I find the guy who did this,

04:08.165 --> 04:10.282
I'll give him a beating
he'll never forget.

04:10.751 --> 04:14.961
Mrs. Whaat, I hereby order you

04:15.338 --> 04:18.046
to take care of the contents
of this package.

04:18.550 --> 04:21.793
I would love to, Your Highness!
- But what should we call it?

04:22.345 --> 04:23.756
The child needs a name.

04:24.222 --> 04:27.886
Is it a male
or a female subject?

04:29.644 --> 04:32.603
Maybe we could...

04:34.733 --> 04:36.770
I will check, Your Majesty.

04:41.907 --> 04:43.148
A boy!

04:44.868 --> 04:46.780
And what are we
going to call him?

04:48.580 --> 04:49.741
Pip...

04:51.333 --> 04:52.995
I would call him Jim.

04:54.878 --> 04:56.164
What do you think?

04:59.341 --> 05:01.253
Jim? Yes?

05:32.874 --> 05:34.035
Cake!

05:36.962 --> 05:38.078
I want it!

05:45.679 --> 05:47.762
You can't do that,
this is the king.

05:51.810 --> 05:55.303
Good day, Mrs. Whaat!
- Mr. Sleeve, a good day to you!

06:07.033 --> 06:08.490
...and pull.

06:10.829 --> 06:12.661
We're about to go in!

06:13.582 --> 06:15.073
Into the tunnel.

06:39.149 --> 06:40.515
Here you go, Jim...

06:41.151 --> 06:44.770
The next time it rips,
you just button it up.

06:46.573 --> 06:47.814
Oh,

06:48.825 --> 06:50.157
a button.

06:51.703 --> 06:53.490
Jim Button.

06:54.539 --> 06:56.371
That is a nice name.

06:58.501 --> 06:59.708
Thank you, Mom.

07:17.395 --> 07:18.852
Good day, Mrs. Whaat!

07:19.189 --> 07:20.600
Good day, Mr. Sleeve!

07:20.941 --> 07:24.025
What can I do for you on this
beautiful summer morning?

07:24.361 --> 07:27.104
My dear, you were so friendly
to offer me help.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.030
Oh, right. You wanted me to
mend and iron something for you.

07:30.325 --> 07:32.191
Where is the piece?

07:32.827 --> 07:35.035
A Sunday suit,
two silken frock-coats,

07:35.330 --> 07:37.242
three belly bands,
four bow-ties,

07:37.624 --> 07:38.956
and five pairs of woolen socks.

07:39.834 --> 07:40.995
Woolen...

07:42.545 --> 07:45.663
Underpants?
- Yes.

07:46.925 --> 07:49.087
How charming.
Jim!

07:49.469 --> 07:52.712
Be a dear and bring this
into the storeroom.

07:53.056 --> 07:54.592
But I have to help Luke.

07:54.891 --> 07:56.974
Luke can wait
another two minutes.

08:04.442 --> 08:07.435
And please be careful, okay?

08:08.279 --> 08:09.861
Sure, Mr. Sleeve.

08:11.908 --> 08:12.944
This boy.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.864
If he spent some more time
reading and writing

08:16.162 --> 08:17.653
and less time with engines...

08:17.998 --> 08:21.116
He wouldn't be our Jim.
Right, Mr. Sleeve?

08:21.960 --> 08:24.953
You have a point there.
Good day, Mrs. Whaat.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.129
Good day, Mr. Sleeve.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.996
The Wild 13...

09:56.805 --> 09:57.921
Alright, Emma...

10:01.017 --> 10:02.633
This will do you good.

10:03.978 --> 10:05.014
Morning, Jim!

10:07.065 --> 10:08.431
Can you hand me the bolt?

10:11.945 --> 10:13.277
Hammer?

10:18.660 --> 10:19.821
Screwdriver!

10:26.918 --> 10:28.329
Right then, my girl.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.269
I guess I needed that shower.

10:55.196 --> 10:57.688
Why am I black and you,
Mrs. Whaat, Mr. Sleeve

10:58.074 --> 10:59.235
and King Alfons are not?

10:59.951 --> 11:01.943
That's how we were born, son.

11:02.620 --> 11:03.610
Oil can...

11:07.000 --> 11:09.583
It's just pretend, isn't it?

11:10.086 --> 11:12.328
What?
- That Mrs. Whaat is my mother.

11:16.885 --> 11:20.469
Who knows, maybe
everything is pretend, Jim.

11:21.264 --> 11:25.133
Maybe you and I
and Emma are not really here.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.808
But the fact that Mrs. Whaat
loves you is not pretend.

11:33.568 --> 11:36.481
Luke, where am I from?

11:45.205 --> 11:47.697
Good morning.
- Luke, this is your King

11:48.041 --> 11:50.408
Alfons the Quarter to 12th
- Oh, Your Highness.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.954
I would like to have
a word with you, if possible.

11:54.297 --> 11:56.084
Yes, right away.

11:57.258 --> 11:59.796
I have a personal audience
with the king.

12:00.762 --> 12:02.594
I better get going.

12:12.815 --> 12:15.774
Yes, they are absolutely right!

12:16.194 --> 12:18.436
My rear... Dear colleague.

12:18.947 --> 12:22.190
Granting people
the right to vote

12:22.617 --> 12:26.076
was a hefty blow
to us monarchs. Yes...

12:29.958 --> 12:31.324
My audience.

12:34.337 --> 12:35.828
I have to go.

12:49.519 --> 12:50.726
Come in!

12:56.818 --> 12:58.309
You wanted to see me,
Your Highness.

12:58.987 --> 12:59.727
- My dear Luke.

13:00.113 --> 13:03.322
Yes, indeed.
Please, kneel.

13:06.536 --> 13:10.246
Forget about that, no time for
formalities. Please sit down.

13:15.670 --> 13:16.660
Dear Luke.

13:17.839 --> 13:19.831
Listen! I mean... Stop!

13:21.009 --> 13:23.217
Morrowland may be tiny,

13:24.012 --> 13:26.629
but it has the same problems
as every other place.

13:27.015 --> 13:30.349
Pollution, traffic jams
and overpopulation.

13:30.643 --> 13:34.478
And there is no way around it.
We just have to do it.

13:37.567 --> 13:38.648
What do we have to do?

13:39.319 --> 13:40.435
I didn't mention it?

13:42.655 --> 13:44.692
Emma has to go.

13:45.950 --> 13:49.569
But as a sign of our appreciation
of her many years of loyal service,

13:49.996 --> 13:52.283
we will honor her
with this award.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.540
The Morrowland Medal.

13:54.917 --> 13:55.907
Emma has to go?

13:56.502 --> 13:57.709
That's what I said.

13:58.880 --> 13:59.836
Never!

14:01.174 --> 14:02.381
Luke?

14:02.884 --> 14:04.671
It's either Emma or Jim.

14:05.345 --> 14:09.180
But Jim is just a boy!
- Yes, but how much longer?

14:10.266 --> 14:12.883
Maybe one day he will want
to marry and own a house and...

14:13.227 --> 14:15.685
Where are we supposed
to put that, Luke?

14:16.230 --> 14:20.224
Once the train station
and the train tracks are gone,

14:20.568 --> 14:22.810
there will be enough space

14:23.154 --> 14:26.067
that Jim can respite...
I mean, reside there.

14:26.407 --> 14:29.525
Yes, but... - We will find
a quiet place for Emma,

14:29.911 --> 14:32.278
a nice spot
in the junkyard and...

14:33.039 --> 14:36.703
There she can enjoy the rest
of her life in peace and quiet.

14:37.210 --> 14:40.999
After all, she is quite old.

14:43.007 --> 14:45.465
And I mean,
my existence, or excellence...

14:45.760 --> 14:47.217
I mean, my humble self...

14:48.012 --> 14:50.470
Well, whatever. Luke?

14:52.016 --> 14:53.507
Luke?

15:22.380 --> 15:24.497
He wants to throw her out,
like garbage.

15:24.841 --> 15:26.582
He thinks just because he's king,

15:26.884 --> 15:28.170
he can do as he pleases.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.503
It's about time
we taught him a lesson.

15:32.014 --> 15:33.926
What kind of lesson, Luke?

15:35.268 --> 15:37.476
Do you know why
trains travel on tracks?

15:37.812 --> 15:40.099
So they stay on course.

15:40.523 --> 15:42.389
If we leave,
there'll be no more tracks.

15:42.692 --> 15:44.103
Then Emma and I
decide where we go.

15:44.402 --> 15:47.520
and nobody can tell us what
to do or just get rid of us.

15:47.905 --> 15:50.272
Leave? Luke!

15:51.701 --> 15:52.942
You don't mean that.

15:53.244 --> 15:56.487
What am I supposed to do?
Resist royal orders?

15:56.831 --> 15:58.322
That would be high treason.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.075
There must be a way.

16:02.837 --> 16:04.624
There has to be a way.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.100
Maybe he is right, Emma.

16:19.770 --> 16:21.807
Morrowland is just
too small for all of us.

16:25.193 --> 16:27.856
No, old girl.
They will not separate us.

16:28.321 --> 16:29.687
Never.

16:31.407 --> 16:33.273
We are leaving.
You and I. The two of us.

16:34.243 --> 16:35.984
And I'm coming, too!

16:36.287 --> 16:37.448
What?

16:38.539 --> 16:40.747
No way.
- But I can help you.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.791
We don't have enough room.
- I don't need much room.

16:44.128 --> 16:45.790
Way too dangerous!
- I love danger!

16:46.923 --> 16:47.959
Think about it, Jim.

16:48.299 --> 16:49.961
Emma has to go
so there is more room for you.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.211
If you leave, Emma might as well
stay here. It makes no sense!

16:53.596 --> 16:56.384
But you
and Emma are my best friends.

16:56.974 --> 16:59.512
And if you think I'll just
watch you leave Morrowland,

16:59.810 --> 17:01.267
you've got
another thing coming.

17:01.771 --> 17:05.390
Besides, if we're already
heading out into the world,

17:06.442 --> 17:08.684
we might find out
where I'm from.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.484
It could be dangerous.

17:15.576 --> 17:17.407
Nobody knows
what awaits us out there.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.411
Don't worry!

17:21.290 --> 17:23.373
I'll watch out for you.

18:15.052 --> 18:16.543
All right, girl.

18:27.315 --> 18:29.602
Wait for me, Luke! I'm coming.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.480
I thought
you changed your mind.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.105
There was something
I needed to do first.

18:37.617 --> 18:40.109
Did you say goodbye?

18:41.162 --> 18:45.156
Jim Button, you are the finest
person I have ever met.

18:48.419 --> 18:49.751
Come on board.

18:53.841 --> 18:55.457
Ready?

19:09.565 --> 19:11.431
Well, dear Emma, let's go.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.652
I'm not crying,

19:16.322 --> 19:19.030
there is just some smoke
in my eyes, old girl.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.650
Goodbye, Morrowland.

19:26.123 --> 19:27.989
We'd better not look back.

19:57.154 --> 19:59.441
<i>I left with Luke and Emma.</i>

20:01.784 --> 20:03.776
<i>Don't cry, don't worry.</i>

20:04.954 --> 20:07.162
<i>Kisses, I love you, Jim.</i>

20:33.774 --> 20:34.810
Hang on!

20:37.653 --> 20:38.689
Jim!

20:46.829 --> 20:48.320
Luke!

20:49.582 --> 20:50.698
Hang in there, Jim!

20:51.917 --> 20:52.907
Help!

20:54.587 --> 20:55.794
Lukas, help!

20:58.841 --> 21:00.127
Jim!

21:09.560 --> 21:10.767
Swim!

21:18.360 --> 21:19.476
Come on, boy!

21:21.697 --> 21:22.983
You can do it, hang on!

21:24.074 --> 21:25.190
Hang on!

21:37.922 --> 21:39.834
You're almost there, come here!

21:41.759 --> 21:42.920
Yes!

21:43.302 --> 21:44.463
Get in!

21:45.763 --> 21:47.470
Come on,
I'll fasten you to this.

21:48.516 --> 21:49.882
Don't look back.

21:55.439 --> 21:56.395
Duck!

22:50.744 --> 22:52.861
Hey, Luke, wake up!

22:56.333 --> 22:58.791
Luke, wake up!

22:59.920 --> 23:01.627
I think we might be in heaven.

23:28.032 --> 23:31.116
This must be Mandala.
The legendary empire.

23:31.952 --> 23:34.035
Come on, we'll go and
visit the emperor and ask him

23:34.371 --> 23:37.205
if he has a use for
two genuine engine drivers

23:37.583 --> 23:39.165
and an old tin can like Emma.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.707
No offense, old girl.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.877
First let's see
if we can fix you up a bit.

24:04.193 --> 24:05.775
Did you find something?

24:06.737 --> 24:08.069
It's a letter in a bottle.

24:25.172 --> 24:27.505
Dear stranger.

24:28.050 --> 24:30.713
Please bring
this letter to my father.

24:32.137 --> 24:34.254
The... Something.

24:35.182 --> 24:38.220
I was captured by..

24:39.561 --> 24:40.802
... Another something.

24:41.689 --> 24:42.805
"And sold to Mrs....

24:44.900 --> 24:46.687
... Grindtooth!

24:48.570 --> 24:49.811
Mrs. Grindtooth?

24:56.120 --> 24:58.487
This place is called Dragon...

24:58.998 --> 25:00.330
Dragon something.

25:01.917 --> 25:03.283
"Please, Dad, save us.

25:04.044 --> 25:05.125
Li Si.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.541
That's really something.
- Li Si?

25:08.298 --> 25:09.288
What's that?

25:10.092 --> 25:11.583
A name, maybe.

25:15.472 --> 25:16.758
Let's go there.

25:58.223 --> 26:01.261
Look, the famous
hair counters of Mandala.

26:01.685 --> 26:04.894
They take batches of 100 hairs
and tie them into bows.

26:05.272 --> 26:06.604
And there are the ear cleaners.

26:07.316 --> 26:09.103
They stand on their
customers' shoulders

26:09.401 --> 26:11.563
and clean their ears
with tiny spoons.

26:17.159 --> 26:19.697
Luke! Look at that!

26:37.429 --> 26:38.419
Look at him!

26:41.183 --> 26:44.347
And them! - Those are the famous
children and children's children

26:44.686 --> 26:47.269
and children's children's children
of the Mandalese people.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.222
Yet another whimsicality.

27:25.310 --> 27:26.300
Jim!

27:27.271 --> 27:28.682
Princess Li Si.

27:32.442 --> 27:34.308
She is the Princess of Mandala.

27:35.696 --> 27:37.232
We have to go help her!

27:38.323 --> 27:40.155
We have to see her father, Luke!

27:41.160 --> 27:42.947
Her father is the emperor.

27:46.498 --> 27:47.739
Come on!

28:01.847 --> 28:04.430
And what might
the esteemed gentlemen be wishing?

28:04.850 --> 28:08.343
We are two foreign engine drivers
and would like to talk to the emperor.

28:09.104 --> 28:12.723
Please excuse me, I am no more worthy
than the lowest aphid,

28:13.734 --> 28:17.273
but I'm afraid the emperor is very busy.

28:17.571 --> 28:21.406
But it's very important!
- When does he have time?

28:21.783 --> 28:26.494
My regrets. Our sovereign ruler
is always busy.

28:27.331 --> 28:29.323
Now, please excuse me.

28:31.418 --> 28:32.750
Holy buffer stop.

28:33.462 --> 28:37.581
Perhaps I can be of assistance,
honorable strangers.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.424
I'm down here!

28:42.221 --> 28:45.385
And who are you, little guy?
- My name is Ping Pong.

28:45.724 --> 28:48.842
I am the 32nd children's child

28:49.228 --> 28:51.686
of Mr. Shu Fu Lu Pi Plu,

28:52.064 --> 28:55.273
His Imperial Majesty's chief chef.

28:56.193 --> 28:58.901
Forgive me, but I cannot help

28:59.238 --> 29:02.822
hearing groans
from your honorable stomachs.

29:03.200 --> 29:04.941
Well, that's because we are starving!

29:05.244 --> 29:07.907
In that case,
I would be honored to serve you

29:08.205 --> 29:10.868
the emperor's breakfast.

29:11.458 --> 29:15.042
Doesn't the emperor want it himself?
- He only eats the bread of sorrow,

29:15.379 --> 29:17.837
but we still prepare breakfast

29:18.173 --> 29:21.541
in case he changes his imperial mind.

29:21.969 --> 29:24.586
But today he didn't touch it again,

29:26.098 --> 29:29.341
so allow me to serve it to you.
Wait here!

29:36.149 --> 29:38.766
Maybe that little guy
can take us to the emperor?

29:39.278 --> 29:40.735
But he is still a baby...

29:49.204 --> 29:53.118
Forgive me, honorable strangers,
but I'm no baby anymore!

29:53.917 --> 29:56.204
I am 368 days old

29:56.545 --> 29:59.288
and already allowed to work
in the imperial kitchen.

29:59.631 --> 30:02.874
And what do you have there?
- All the delicacies of Mandala.

30:08.098 --> 30:12.934
Century eggs
on tender squirrel ear salad,

30:13.312 --> 30:14.974
candied earthworms,

30:15.314 --> 30:18.148
tree bark pudding
topped with horse hoof flakes.

30:18.442 --> 30:21.606
Ping Pong, I'm sure it's all delicious,

30:21.987 --> 30:24.775
but don't you have something...
- ... more simple?

30:25.115 --> 30:26.231
Yes!
- Of course!

30:26.616 --> 30:30.109
Crunchy locust legs
with a spicy June bug,

30:30.412 --> 30:33.655
crudites or boiled wasps' nests

30:33.999 --> 30:36.332
with snake skin in oil and vinegar.

30:46.636 --> 30:48.002
Enjoy.

30:59.191 --> 31:00.272
It's not bad at all.

31:01.026 --> 31:05.521
Frog's eyeballs with ant dumplings
on caviar in slug slime.

31:06.406 --> 31:07.897
A rare treat!

31:36.478 --> 31:37.468
Tasty.

31:38.146 --> 31:41.981
But don't you have anything like
buttered bread or cheese sandwiches?

31:42.484 --> 31:44.020
Cheese? Yuck!

31:44.319 --> 31:47.483
Forgive me for shuddering,
honorable strangers.

31:47.864 --> 31:50.197
Is cheese not made from putrid milk?

31:50.534 --> 31:52.116
Who would eat such a thing?

31:52.702 --> 31:54.068
We would!

31:55.288 --> 31:57.871
I'll see what I can do for you.

31:58.375 --> 32:01.868
Wait a second. Why does the emperor
only eat the bread of sorrow?

32:02.295 --> 32:04.207
Nobody may speak about it.

32:04.548 --> 32:08.132
The emperor himself
has vowed to be silent

32:08.468 --> 32:12.212
until his beloved Princess Li Si
is returned to him.

32:12.764 --> 32:14.505
She was kidnapped, wasn't she?

32:15.267 --> 32:18.385
Who did it?
- Pirates, they say.

32:20.647 --> 32:23.390
Oops, it's the hour of the cricket.

32:24.025 --> 32:27.268
All the children's children
get their bottles now.

32:27.654 --> 32:29.771
Please allow me to feed myself.

32:30.240 --> 32:31.356
Go, little friend.

32:38.457 --> 32:39.948
Jim, we should...

32:41.001 --> 32:42.287
Jim?

32:46.381 --> 32:49.419
Perhaps it has escaped
your honorable ears,

32:49.759 --> 32:51.170
revered guests.

32:51.636 --> 32:54.629
The emperor is busy. Now leave!

32:54.973 --> 32:58.933
But we have come here to save
Princess Li Si. - Be gone, I say!

32:59.811 --> 33:02.804
Hey, buster!
Did you not hear what the boy said?

33:03.231 --> 33:06.724
Tell the emperor that Jim Button
and Luke the engine driver are here

33:07.110 --> 33:09.318
with important news about his daughter.

33:09.738 --> 33:11.229
Well, that's a different matter.

33:11.865 --> 33:15.279
Would you be so kind
to release me from your honorable hands?

33:15.619 --> 33:18.236
I shall be pleased
to open the gate for you.

33:30.842 --> 33:32.174
Well, who do we have here?

33:32.511 --> 33:34.628
The Captain
of the Imperial Palace Guards.

33:35.138 --> 33:36.879
I am here on the highest order,

33:37.265 --> 33:38.631
sent to fetch you.

33:39.142 --> 33:40.508
I live to obey.

33:42.521 --> 33:44.057
Well, I don't.

33:45.649 --> 33:46.730
Follow me.

33:48.485 --> 33:50.772
What do you think, Jim?
Should we follow him?

33:51.446 --> 33:53.233
Well, since he asked us so nicely...

34:28.440 --> 34:31.353
Your Highness, my young friend
and I think that we...

34:32.612 --> 34:34.023
You are speaking to...

34:34.489 --> 34:36.856
His Imperial Majesty's chief Mandarin...

34:37.324 --> 34:38.532
...Pi Pa Po.

34:39.369 --> 34:42.157
The emperor is presently indisposed.

34:45.750 --> 34:46.991
We have time.

34:47.543 --> 34:49.877
Tell him we have news
concerning his daughter.

34:50.255 --> 34:51.962
Allow the humble question...

34:52.465 --> 34:54.672
Where are you from?

34:55.385 --> 34:56.751
As I already said, we are two...

34:57.137 --> 34:59.254
Where are you from?
- And what do you want here?

34:59.598 --> 35:02.432
Do you have a pass?
- Or identification?

35:02.726 --> 35:06.390
Without identification,
how do we know you even exist?

35:09.524 --> 35:13.689
I'll give you some proof that I exist
right away if you don't bring us to him!

35:14.070 --> 35:17.484
You dare to insult an Imperial Mandarin?

35:18.450 --> 35:20.157
Captain!

35:20.744 --> 35:21.951
Arrest them!

35:22.329 --> 35:23.410
Seize them!

36:11.211 --> 36:12.327
Come here, boy.

36:39.614 --> 36:41.025
Luke!

36:44.536 --> 36:45.697
Surrender.

36:48.123 --> 36:49.739
Lay them in chains!

36:56.798 --> 37:00.917
You are found guilty of espionage

37:01.302 --> 37:03.589
and sentenced to death.

37:03.888 --> 37:05.595
We have the right
to appeal the sentence.

37:05.890 --> 37:07.301
Indeed you do.

37:07.600 --> 37:08.932
We are appealing the sentence!

37:09.352 --> 37:11.810
I am also the Supreme Justice!

37:12.230 --> 37:13.687
And my ruling is...

37:14.858 --> 37:16.065
Appeal denied!

37:17.402 --> 37:18.563
Off with their heads!

37:20.405 --> 37:21.395
Stop!

37:32.876 --> 37:36.961
Majesty, they are extremely
dangerous spies. - Liar!

37:37.338 --> 37:40.001
We're here to offer our services
as experienced engine drivers.

37:40.383 --> 37:43.046
And to rescue the princess.
- Come on, Jim.

37:43.428 --> 37:44.669
We don't even know where she is.

37:51.686 --> 37:52.722
Hands off!

37:58.109 --> 37:59.350
You are a traitor!

37:59.819 --> 38:03.403
If I ever get my hands on you,
I will crush you like a worm!

38:09.954 --> 38:13.038
Ping Pong, you really are the bravest
Mandalese children's child I know.

38:13.416 --> 38:14.406
Yes.

38:15.293 --> 38:18.786
Your Highness, the pirates who kidnapped
the princess, what were they like?

38:19.297 --> 38:22.415
Our honorable emperor
has taken a vow of silence.

38:23.134 --> 38:26.423
Please follow me, my friends,
and all will be revealed.

38:53.289 --> 38:56.498
Princess Li Si
disappeared without a trace.

38:56.835 --> 39:01.045
But then we found this note
in a bottle in Yellow River.

39:06.886 --> 39:08.422
Don't cry, Mr. Emperor.

39:08.721 --> 39:12.635
Even our wisest men couldn't conjure
the missing words again.

39:18.857 --> 39:19.938
Wait a minute.

39:22.068 --> 39:23.104
Here.

39:28.366 --> 39:32.110
Apparently she wrote several letters.
It's the same handwriting.

39:37.000 --> 39:40.118
Look, if you put the letters on top
of each other, the text is complete.

39:41.379 --> 39:43.837
" was kidnapped by the Wild 13

39:45.133 --> 39:47.750
and sold to Mrs. Grindtooth,

39:48.761 --> 39:52.880
along with many other boys and girls.

39:54.183 --> 39:58.223
We are being held in Dragon City.

40:00.189 --> 40:03.057
The Wild 13 tried to sell me
to Mrs. Grindtooth as well.

40:06.321 --> 40:07.857
But who could this Mrs. Grindtooth be?

40:09.240 --> 40:11.152
And where can we find this Dragon City?

40:15.580 --> 40:18.072
Have the emperor's Scholarly Flowers

40:18.458 --> 40:20.700
assemble in the Great Throne Room.

40:31.679 --> 40:34.763
Assembled before you
are the wisest men in the land.

40:35.141 --> 40:38.555
All the wisdom of our libraries
is stored in their minds.

40:38.895 --> 40:40.807
Ask them whatever you want.

40:41.940 --> 40:45.024
Well, first, where is Dragon City?

40:45.568 --> 40:47.150
And second, how do you get there?

40:59.207 --> 41:03.292
No mortal human being
knows the answer to these questions.

41:05.213 --> 41:06.670
Well, that's a good start.

41:16.557 --> 41:18.423
We assume that the location in question

41:18.726 --> 41:21.594
lies behind
the Red-and-White-Striped Mountains.

41:21.980 --> 41:24.893
That is where the Yellow River
emerges from a deep cave.

41:25.441 --> 41:27.728
Nobody knows its source.

41:31.572 --> 41:33.108
Royal Geographer,

41:34.158 --> 41:35.319
the map!

41:47.880 --> 41:49.963
After passing the Western Gate,

41:50.633 --> 41:53.842
you arrive at the
Forest of a Thousand Wonders.

41:54.679 --> 41:57.888
Behind it lie
the Red-and-White-Striped Mountains,

41:58.224 --> 41:59.590
the Crown of the World.

42:00.226 --> 42:02.969
They are insurmountable.

42:04.230 --> 42:08.190
Here, a bit to the East,
is the Valley of Dusk.

42:08.776 --> 42:11.268
It is haunted by eerie voices.

42:12.238 --> 42:13.524
Beyond the valley

42:14.490 --> 42:18.109
lies a wilderness that some people
call the "Mirror Desert."

42:18.661 --> 42:21.244
In any case, or in every case,

42:21.873 --> 42:23.614
or in whatever case,

42:24.250 --> 42:27.163
it is called "The End of the World."

42:30.214 --> 42:31.750
So where is Dragon City?

42:34.844 --> 42:36.756
It should be...

42:38.097 --> 42:41.932
It should be
beyond the end of the world, yes.

42:42.268 --> 42:43.804
Yes.

42:45.980 --> 42:48.097
Jim, old boy,
do you really want to do this?

42:48.733 --> 42:51.146
But someone has to save the princess.

42:51.486 --> 42:53.728
Deserts, mountains, dragons...

42:54.072 --> 42:56.860
It's not going to be a piece of cake.
You know that, right?

42:57.617 --> 43:00.781
If that's not a job for two
engine drivers, then what is?

43:03.956 --> 43:05.197
Well, then it is decided.

43:24.143 --> 43:25.179
Hold this.

44:02.223 --> 44:04.715
Look, the Forest of a Thousand Wonders.

44:39.468 --> 44:41.676
Those must be
the Red-and-White-Striped Mountains.

44:42.013 --> 44:43.379
The Crown of the World.

44:48.227 --> 44:51.766
And the only way through it
is the Valley of Dusk.

44:52.106 --> 44:54.393
I think we need to head further south.

44:57.820 --> 44:58.810
You see?

44:59.405 --> 45:01.362
One day you will be a real explorer.

45:02.074 --> 45:05.067
But I really want to be
an engine driver, like you.

45:07.079 --> 45:09.116
An engine driver
only follows the tracks to places

45:09.498 --> 45:11.410
that explorers have already discovered.

45:49.497 --> 45:52.080
Do you remember
what the Scholarly Flowers told us?

45:52.416 --> 45:54.157
That the valley is full of eerie voices.

46:01.133 --> 46:02.374
Seems quiet to me.

46:03.177 --> 46:06.341
<i>Seems quiet to me...</i>

46:08.057 --> 46:09.093
What is that?

46:10.184 --> 46:13.097
<i>What is that?</i>
- Don't worry. It's just an echo.

46:13.896 --> 46:15.353
<i>It's just an echo. Don't worry...</i>

46:50.099 --> 46:52.682
<i>What is that... What is that...</i>

46:53.227 --> 46:54.763
<i>Seems quiet to me...</i>

46:55.187 --> 46:56.928
<i>Don't worry...</i>

47:15.624 --> 47:18.583
Emma, you need to go fast now.
Faster than the wind!

47:21.839 --> 47:23.546
Emma, psst. Quiet!

47:53.662 --> 47:55.494
Emergency lever -
Use only if in grave danger!

47:59.543 --> 48:00.829
Sorry, old girl.

48:03.839 --> 48:05.000
Jim, hold on tight!

48:07.009 --> 48:08.090
Go, Emma!

48:15.684 --> 48:18.017
Go!
- Come on, girl!

48:18.562 --> 48:20.975
You can do it! Keep going!

48:21.399 --> 48:24.016
Come on, Emma!
- Emma, go!

48:25.319 --> 48:26.776
You can do it!

48:39.333 --> 48:42.872
Yes! You got us out, Emma!

48:46.507 --> 48:48.999
We made it! Luke, we made it!

48:50.428 --> 48:52.590
Emma did it, not us.

48:56.058 --> 48:57.390
Didn't you, my dear?

48:58.602 --> 49:00.468
Are you all right? Emma?

49:18.080 --> 49:19.446
Oh, Emma.

49:21.083 --> 49:22.415
My poor Emma.

49:23.294 --> 49:24.284
Luke?

49:36.682 --> 49:38.173
Her piston is broken.

49:40.394 --> 49:41.635
Can't we fix it?

49:43.439 --> 49:44.850
Only from the inside,

49:45.399 --> 49:48.267
but if we drain the boiler
we will never get away from here.

49:49.487 --> 49:51.353
Is there really nothing we can do?

49:52.031 --> 49:53.772
Well, there is something.

49:54.867 --> 49:57.575
But it's dangerous. Somebody would
have to go into the boiler.

49:59.955 --> 50:02.743
Someone who is rather small?

50:06.086 --> 50:07.793
Someone who is really small.

50:15.846 --> 50:19.214
No, no. That was a stupid idea.

50:19.600 --> 50:20.841
We will find another way.

50:21.227 --> 50:22.638
But there is no other way.

50:25.481 --> 50:28.019
That guy is just waiting for us
to give up.

50:28.400 --> 50:29.857
But we won't give up!

50:31.820 --> 50:33.106
Tell me what to do.

50:43.499 --> 50:45.991
There's a screw at the bottom.
It needs to be loosened.

50:46.335 --> 50:47.451
Three turns are enough,

50:47.795 --> 50:50.082
then I can install the piston
from underneath.

50:52.508 --> 50:53.589
Jim,

50:54.552 --> 50:55.713
good luck.

51:18.242 --> 51:19.278
Go away!

51:19.868 --> 51:21.200
Come on, go away!

51:24.123 --> 51:25.113
Jim?

51:38.971 --> 51:40.633
Jim, did you find the screw?

51:44.768 --> 51:46.179
Jim, get out of there.

51:46.604 --> 51:47.640
Jim!

51:49.189 --> 51:50.350
Jim!

51:55.070 --> 51:56.277
Jim, don't do this to me!

52:01.118 --> 52:04.202
Emma, help him! Help him!

52:05.331 --> 52:06.822
Jim, get out of there!

52:12.254 --> 52:13.370
I got it!
- You did it!

52:13.714 --> 52:16.206
I got it!
- You did it! Are you all right?

52:17.343 --> 52:18.379
You did it!

52:20.012 --> 52:21.378
Everything okay?
- Yes! Yes!

52:21.680 --> 52:24.388
There you are,
you little troublemaker! Good!

52:24.975 --> 52:26.841
Come here.

52:28.479 --> 52:30.721
Oh, my God, you did it!

52:33.192 --> 52:35.309
You are back!
- Yes.

53:00.803 --> 53:02.465
Luke, look.

53:03.347 --> 53:05.555
Hello!

53:16.527 --> 53:18.393
I think I'm slowly going crazy.

53:26.745 --> 53:28.407
Just what we needed.

53:28.872 --> 53:29.908
Emma is dried up.

53:30.249 --> 53:32.787
That's impossible.
She was full when I was down there.

53:33.085 --> 53:34.371
Yes, but we traveled a long way,

53:34.712 --> 53:36.999
and the water evaporates
in no time in this heat.

53:48.100 --> 53:49.216
Morrowland!

53:53.564 --> 53:54.930
And there is Mrs. Whaat!

54:00.237 --> 54:01.603
Jim!

54:03.699 --> 54:05.656
When will you come back?

54:07.745 --> 54:10.032
I'm right here! I'm sorry!

54:10.372 --> 54:12.238
I know I shouldn't have run away...

54:14.460 --> 54:16.873
Jim, this must be a mirage.

54:17.254 --> 54:18.244
Let me go!

54:18.589 --> 54:20.922
Mrs. Whaat! I'm right here!
- An optical illusion!

54:21.300 --> 54:23.883
If you go out there now,
you will never return!

54:26.805 --> 54:28.592
But I just saw her.

54:31.018 --> 54:33.010
It's a figment of your imagination, Jim.

54:41.153 --> 54:42.689
I'm so thirsty.

54:43.906 --> 54:45.067
Me too.

54:50.996 --> 54:52.032
Luke!

54:55.125 --> 54:56.491
Jim! Stop!

54:57.628 --> 54:59.415
Hello!
- Stop!

55:00.172 --> 55:01.788
You!

55:08.430 --> 55:10.638
Stop!

55:12.100 --> 55:15.468
I don't think that's a mirage!
Run, Luke, run!

55:15.771 --> 55:17.683
Wait, Jim, wait!

55:18.816 --> 55:22.685
I don't want to harm you!

55:23.779 --> 55:25.566
It's a trick! Don't listen to him!

55:28.033 --> 55:30.616
Please don't run away!

55:31.119 --> 55:33.361
He just wants to catch us and eat us.

55:33.705 --> 55:34.991
I'm not so sure about that.

55:35.624 --> 55:36.740
Take a closer look at him.

55:37.459 --> 55:39.826
I'm so terribly lonely,

55:40.128 --> 55:42.586
I need some company.

55:46.301 --> 55:47.417
Hello!

55:49.680 --> 55:52.514
Everything's okay. Please come closer.

55:54.184 --> 55:55.595
You see? Fear doesn't help.

55:56.144 --> 55:58.181
And running away
only makes things worse.

56:02.901 --> 56:03.937
I don't know

56:05.279 --> 56:08.317
how to thank you
for not running away from me.

56:08.657 --> 56:11.570
Oh, please excuse my bad manners.

56:12.327 --> 56:13.488
My name is Tur Tur.

56:14.329 --> 56:17.037
My first name is Tur,
and my last name, too... Tur.

56:17.624 --> 56:18.865
So what are you?

56:19.209 --> 56:21.201
I...
- Are you some kind of mirage?

56:21.753 --> 56:23.085
I am a mock giant.

56:24.256 --> 56:27.090
See, if you step away from me now,

56:27.718 --> 56:31.507
you are looking smaller
and smaller, right?

56:32.431 --> 56:34.548
Well, with me, it's just
the other way around,

56:34.850 --> 56:37.388
I look bigger and bigger.

56:38.770 --> 56:40.136
But I'm babbling,

56:41.023 --> 56:43.390
you must be tired
from your long trip, right?

56:43.734 --> 56:44.815
Please follow me.

56:45.152 --> 56:47.314
It would be a big honor

56:47.654 --> 56:49.816
to invite you to my humble oasis.

56:51.116 --> 56:52.482
We can't leave Emma behind.

56:53.994 --> 56:55.155
She has no water left.

56:56.204 --> 56:59.038
Oh, no worries.
There is plenty of water in my oasis.

56:59.499 --> 57:02.412
Come on. We will pick up Emma later.
- Come on.

57:54.888 --> 57:56.629
Thank you for the meal, Mr. Tur Tur.

57:56.932 --> 57:58.764
But now I'm excited to hear your story.

57:59.101 --> 58:00.842
Have you always been a mock giant?

58:03.021 --> 58:04.728
I was born like this, Mr. Jim.

58:05.440 --> 58:07.773
As a child,
nobody wanted to play with me.

58:08.110 --> 58:10.272
My parents were the only ones
who weren't afraid of me.

58:12.030 --> 58:14.067
They were wonderful parents, you know.

58:15.325 --> 58:16.361
When they died,

58:17.077 --> 58:19.785
I decided to look for a place
where nobody was afraid of me.

58:20.080 --> 58:22.663
But wherever I went,
it was always the same.

58:24.334 --> 58:26.496
That's why I live in the desert now.

58:28.922 --> 58:31.255
I was longing so very much

58:31.633 --> 58:34.546
to talk to somebody
one more time before I die,

58:35.929 --> 58:37.761
and you made this wish come true.

58:39.766 --> 58:43.680
You are the first people
since my parents who weren't afraid.

58:45.188 --> 58:46.599
Whenever I get lonely,

58:47.357 --> 58:48.689
I shall think of you.

58:49.192 --> 58:50.979
Of your friends Jim and Luke.

58:52.070 --> 58:56.064
Does that mean... I... We are friends?

58:56.575 --> 58:57.816
Oh, yeah, of course.

58:58.160 --> 58:59.150
Of course.

59:00.120 --> 59:01.531
How can I thank you?

59:02.873 --> 59:04.990
You could show us
the way to Dragon City.

59:07.878 --> 59:10.541
Well, Dragon City
is the capitol of Sorrowland.

59:10.839 --> 59:12.125
Sorrowland?

59:21.975 --> 59:23.557
That must be it, Luke!

59:24.227 --> 59:27.971
The mailman somehow mistook
Sorrowland for Morrowland.

59:29.775 --> 59:33.143
That's why he brought me
to you back then. - Yes.

59:34.404 --> 59:37.317
Another name for Sorrowland
is Land of a Thousand Volcanoes.

59:38.033 --> 59:39.899
There is only one way
that leads there...

59:40.660 --> 59:42.868
Through the Black Rock Region.

59:44.122 --> 59:47.911
A hundred miles of black,
freezing nothing.

59:49.544 --> 59:51.001
Would you show us the way?

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.292
We're going in there?

01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:33.411
It's the only way.

01:00:33.839 --> 01:00:35.205
I don't see one.

01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:37.627
That's the secret of the black rocks.

01:00:38.135 --> 01:00:41.378
They are so black,
they swallow all light.

01:00:42.055 --> 01:00:45.014
One misstep, and you freeze.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:49.143
To the left and to the right,
there are huge abysses.

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:51.311
You'd better not stray from the path.

01:00:53.733 --> 01:00:56.350
At the highest point,
you will pass a stone arch,

01:00:56.736 --> 01:00:59.274
the Mouth of Death, through which
the wind moans and whispers.

01:01:03.785 --> 01:01:04.901
Please don't forget me.

01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:06.656
How could we?

01:01:08.165 --> 01:01:09.497
Thanks, Mr. Tur Tur!

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:29.258
Goodbye!

01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:50.495
Let's get going, my girl.

01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:34.031
We should turn on Emma's lamps.

01:02:35.919 --> 01:02:37.876
Already done.

01:02:39.506 --> 01:02:41.793
How are we supposed
to steer through this blackness?

01:02:42.175 --> 01:02:43.711
Let's leave that to Emma.

01:02:45.095 --> 01:02:46.802
She's gone through many dark tunnels.

01:02:47.138 --> 01:02:48.345
She will find a way.

01:02:50.267 --> 01:02:52.384
What was that?

01:02:54.396 --> 01:02:55.932
Jim, we have a bigger problem.

01:03:00.068 --> 01:03:01.400
We are almost out of coal.

01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:03.565
How long will it last?

01:03:07.158 --> 01:03:09.571
One more hour, maybe two.

01:03:50.577 --> 01:03:51.693
What's wrong now?

01:03:52.537 --> 01:03:53.994
Emma lost sight of the path.

01:04:05.383 --> 01:04:07.875
Keep going, Emma! You can do it!

01:04:09.429 --> 01:04:10.510
This is it.

01:04:11.890 --> 01:04:15.054
But if we stand here any longer,
we will freeze to death.

01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:25.146
Jim! Emma is done.

01:04:27.113 --> 01:04:28.604
We have to go outside!

01:04:29.199 --> 01:04:30.906
Maybe we can help Emma!

01:04:31.409 --> 01:04:32.820
That would be suicide, Jim.

01:04:35.288 --> 01:04:36.870
It's just too cold.

01:04:37.832 --> 01:04:39.494
We have to do something!

01:04:52.389 --> 01:04:55.097
I bet the sun is out
right now in Morrowland.

01:04:55.892 --> 01:04:57.508
And Mrs. Whaat is baking a cake.

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:02.597
Hey, Luke, do you remember the smell?

01:05:03.316 --> 01:05:06.650
Almonds and honey and marzipan...

01:05:07.695 --> 01:05:09.402
I love marzipan.

01:05:10.698 --> 01:05:13.862
She always puts it on the windowsill
to cool...

01:05:14.536 --> 01:05:16.072
She puts it there on purpose.

01:05:17.038 --> 01:05:18.620
She knows how much you like to nibble.

01:05:19.999 --> 01:05:22.082
Do you think she hasn't noticed?

01:05:25.755 --> 01:05:28.168
I'll never be able to nibble
on a piece of that again.

01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:32.050
I'm sorry, my friend.

01:05:47.652 --> 01:05:48.642
Jim!

01:05:49.446 --> 01:05:51.233
Luke! Look!

01:05:56.661 --> 01:05:58.152
Emma, you have to help me now.

01:05:58.746 --> 01:05:59.782
When I say, "Go!"

01:06:00.248 --> 01:06:03.207
you just whistle
as loud as you can, okay?

01:06:05.503 --> 01:06:08.541
On your marks, get set, go!

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:20.133
The steam is turning into snow!
- It works! More!

01:06:21.227 --> 01:06:22.638
Keep whistling!

01:06:25.064 --> 01:06:27.397
The snow makes the path visible.

01:06:28.234 --> 01:06:29.315
Jim, you are a genius!

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:38.571
The Mouth of Death.

01:06:39.621 --> 01:06:41.954
One more yard and we would have crashed.

01:06:42.874 --> 01:06:44.115
Let's get out of here.

01:07:00.642 --> 01:07:03.430
Just a little more, then it's downhill.

01:07:03.811 --> 01:07:04.972
Yeah!

01:07:07.273 --> 01:07:09.356
Come on, Emma!
- Yes!

01:07:20.203 --> 01:07:21.193
Emma!

01:07:23.122 --> 01:07:25.239
Emma!
- Yes! We made it!

01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:28.038
Yes! We did it!

01:07:28.378 --> 01:07:29.789
Yes!

01:07:34.759 --> 01:07:36.716
It's getting warmer.
- Yes.

01:07:38.471 --> 01:07:39.678
Come on, let's get out of here!

01:07:58.199 --> 01:08:00.236
This must be
the Land of a Thousand Volcanoes.

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:03.611
Looks like it.

01:08:04.038 --> 01:08:05.904
Careful!

01:08:09.836 --> 01:08:10.872
There!

01:08:11.296 --> 01:08:13.959
Take cover, get in there!
Emma, take care!

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:32.185
Who dares disturb the peace of a dragon?

01:08:34.277 --> 01:08:37.236
Don't move, Jim!
- Run away as long as you can

01:08:37.779 --> 01:08:40.773
or I will eat you alive...

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:44.326
Shoot.

01:08:45.412 --> 01:08:49.532
I am the most gruesome, terrible,
bloodthirsty dragon

01:08:49.876 --> 01:08:51.162
that ever existed!

01:08:51.794 --> 01:08:55.082
Hello? I said
I am the most gruesome, terrible...

01:08:55.423 --> 01:08:57.380
Yes, I got it.

01:08:57.716 --> 01:08:59.629
You're not afraid of me?

01:08:59.926 --> 01:09:01.337
Should we be?

01:09:01.679 --> 01:09:03.386
Oh, what a disgrace!

01:09:03.765 --> 01:09:05.096
What shame!

01:09:06.725 --> 01:09:09.389
Not even humans think I'm a real dragon,

01:09:09.687 --> 01:09:11.223
what an unlucky day!

01:09:11.522 --> 01:09:13.559
Who says you are not a real dragon?

01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:16.895
The true-bred dragons
won't let me enter Dragon City anymore,

01:09:17.278 --> 01:09:20.567
only because my mother was a hippo,
and I am a half-dragon.

01:09:20.907 --> 01:09:21.897
A hippo?

01:09:22.241 --> 01:09:24.779
Well, my father was pretty shortsighted.

01:09:25.578 --> 01:09:28.821
The true dragons say
a half-dragon is good for nothing.

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:30.576
Sometimes I think they are right.

01:09:30.917 --> 01:09:34.285
I can't even set my own volcano on fire!

01:09:34.629 --> 01:09:35.665
Let's see!

01:09:35.962 --> 01:09:38.000
Engine drivers are experts
when it comes to fire.

01:09:38.424 --> 01:09:39.460
Sure, why not.

01:09:40.051 --> 01:09:41.462
But if this is a trick...

01:09:41.761 --> 01:09:45.630
I will... I... Never mind.

01:09:46.224 --> 01:09:48.682
The oven is over there.
I am Nepomuk, by the way.

01:09:49.602 --> 01:09:51.719
It's nice here, Nepomuk. Very nice.

01:09:52.063 --> 01:09:55.147
How nice of you to say that.
- But where's your bed?

01:09:55.483 --> 01:09:57.600
I prefer sleeping
on my precious coal bed.

01:09:57.944 --> 01:09:59.731
Then I don't have
to get dirty every morning.

01:10:00.071 --> 01:10:03.815
Humans wash themselves,
we do the opposite, you see?

01:10:05.743 --> 01:10:06.859
No?

01:10:10.998 --> 01:10:13.331
I hope you know what you're doing.

01:10:16.462 --> 01:10:17.498
So?

01:10:18.464 --> 01:10:20.877
Oh, that doesn't sound too good.

01:10:22.593 --> 01:10:24.209
I see the problem.
- Problem?

01:10:24.554 --> 01:10:26.420
The vent is blocked.
- The vent?

01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:28.385
Bring me some tools.

01:10:32.019 --> 01:10:33.385
What was that noise?

01:10:34.439 --> 01:10:35.805
Does it have to be so rough?

01:10:36.399 --> 01:10:37.765
Don't break anything.

01:10:41.654 --> 01:10:42.895
Did you fix it?

01:10:44.365 --> 01:10:45.651
Now it's fixed.

01:10:45.992 --> 01:10:48.109
Your vent was blocked.

01:10:48.453 --> 01:10:50.991
And your chimney was clogged up.
- What was wrong with it?

01:10:51.330 --> 01:10:53.242
Who had a defect? Oh!

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.992
My volcano is smoking again!

01:10:56.377 --> 01:10:57.709
Thank you so much!

01:10:58.004 --> 01:11:00.747
You worked so hard.
Do you have a wish? Anything?

01:11:01.048 --> 01:11:04.462
Maybe some lava?
- I'm sure that would be very nice.

01:11:04.844 --> 01:11:08.428
But for now we would be happy
with some coal for Emma.

01:11:08.723 --> 01:11:09.713
Coal?

01:11:10.057 --> 01:11:11.639
Feel free, I have enough.

01:11:11.976 --> 01:11:14.935
Nepomuk, we need to get to Dragon City.

01:11:15.313 --> 01:11:16.849
Can you tell us how to get there?

01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:18.730
Do I look like a traitor?

01:11:19.066 --> 01:11:22.025
I mustn't tell you about
the secret entrance, it's impossible!

01:11:22.361 --> 01:11:25.729
Us dragons must stick together!
The question in itself is insulting.

01:11:26.073 --> 01:11:29.066
I mean, on the other hand...
You helped me.

01:11:30.036 --> 01:11:34.121
Yes, and the dragons in Sorrowland
are very mean to half-dragons.

01:11:35.666 --> 01:11:38.909
Deal, I will do it!
You are quite persuasive!

01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:41.002
Well, it wasn't easy.

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:42.996
I'm a tough nut to crack.

01:11:43.382 --> 01:11:46.625
So, did you see
the tall volcano out there?

01:11:47.553 --> 01:11:49.260
Inside it is the city of the dragons!

01:11:49.597 --> 01:11:50.929
It's huge!

01:11:51.307 --> 01:11:52.718
The dragons have been living there

01:11:53.059 --> 01:11:55.893
since the rest of the world
has become too dangerous for them.

01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:57.602
And how do you enter the city?

01:11:57.939 --> 01:12:00.431
There is only one entrance,
and it is guarded day and night.

01:12:00.775 --> 01:12:03.984
The dragons won't let anybody in
that doesn't look like a true dragon.

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.357
And what does a true dragon look like?

01:12:06.697 --> 01:12:10.316
Well, a true dragon has to spit fire
and look unlike any other animal.

01:12:10.743 --> 01:12:14.362
It has to be terrifying
and gruesome, like so...

01:12:23.506 --> 01:12:24.542
All right, wait for it.

01:12:28.803 --> 01:12:29.793
Or like this.

01:12:33.474 --> 01:12:35.181
Stop! You're scaring me!

01:12:36.018 --> 01:12:38.305
Really?
- I'm about to pee my pants.

01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:42.397
Emma also spits smoke and fire,

01:12:42.692 --> 01:12:44.809
but she will never be
as terrifying as you, Nepomuk.

01:12:45.361 --> 01:12:46.977
Really? Honestly?

01:12:49.156 --> 01:12:51.068
Unless we dress her up.

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:55.402
Oh, yes, I love dressing up!

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:19.472
There we go.

01:13:42.710 --> 01:13:43.871
Oh, wow!

01:13:44.170 --> 01:13:47.754
Well, I'd better get out of here
before the true-bred dragons see me.

01:13:48.049 --> 01:13:49.460
Good luck!

01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:51.170
Hey, Nepomuk!
- Yes?

01:13:51.552 --> 01:13:55.421
You're the scariest, most ghastly
half-dragon I've ever met in my life!

01:13:55.765 --> 01:13:57.631
Really? Thank you!

01:14:07.151 --> 01:14:09.017
My lovely dragon girl,

01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:11.611
from now on, we are in your hands.

01:14:30.007 --> 01:14:31.168
Attention!

01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:35.169
Non-true-bred dragons who try to enter
will be punished by death!

01:14:59.787 --> 01:15:01.278
Who is it?

01:15:38.617 --> 01:15:39.607
Oh,

01:15:40.327 --> 01:15:43.695
what a nice pair of shiny eyes!

01:15:48.002 --> 01:15:49.743
What a voice!

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:54.214
And what a beautiful stench!

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:55.881
I like you.

01:15:57.136 --> 01:15:58.718
Say, where do you live?

01:16:00.014 --> 01:16:01.676
My shift is almost over,

01:16:02.516 --> 01:16:04.758
let's go for a walk later.

01:16:05.728 --> 01:16:07.469
What do you think?

01:16:10.357 --> 01:16:11.893
Are you shy?

01:16:12.526 --> 01:16:15.269
You're not very talkative.

01:16:23.370 --> 01:16:25.987
Do you think you're better than me?

01:16:27.541 --> 01:16:30.534
Get out of here, you rude lizard!

01:16:31.045 --> 01:16:32.206
Yes.

01:16:33.422 --> 01:16:34.958
What a shame.

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:37.416
Such a pretty thing.

01:16:48.562 --> 01:16:49.769
Old Street

01:16:50.356 --> 01:16:51.688
133...

01:16:58.739 --> 01:17:00.446
I don't see any children,

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:02.782
not even dragon children.

01:17:03.119 --> 01:17:05.156
That's probably
why they call it Sorrowland.

01:17:08.624 --> 01:17:09.660
There it is!

01:17:10.251 --> 01:17:11.241
Old Street!

01:17:58.966 --> 01:18:01.709
Mrs. Grindtooth. Knock three times.

01:18:02.052 --> 01:18:03.759
Visitors not welcome.

01:18:08.142 --> 01:18:09.349
You!

01:18:09.935 --> 01:18:12.097
What are you waiting for? Say...

01:18:13.522 --> 01:18:17.015
How much is six times eight?

01:18:17.359 --> 01:18:19.976
Six times eight. That is...

01:18:21.572 --> 01:18:22.733
42?

01:18:26.994 --> 01:18:28.075
Sit!

01:18:28.913 --> 01:18:29.903
Fail!

01:18:31.874 --> 01:18:33.331
And now you,

01:18:34.919 --> 01:18:36.535
number seven!

01:18:43.719 --> 01:18:45.005
Come on!

01:18:46.055 --> 01:18:48.968
Six times eight!

01:18:50.351 --> 01:18:52.138
Say it!

01:18:52.478 --> 01:18:54.470
That...

01:18:55.147 --> 01:18:56.183
is...

01:18:58.776 --> 01:19:01.484
Hurry up!

01:19:02.863 --> 01:19:05.276
Princess Li Si! That's her!

01:19:05.866 --> 01:19:08.700
Who is whispering?

01:19:10.621 --> 01:19:13.989
Did I tell you to stop?

01:19:15.376 --> 01:19:17.083
Number seven!

01:19:17.419 --> 01:19:19.001
Now I know!

01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:20.416
Thirty-five?

01:19:20.798 --> 01:19:24.132
You dumb child!

01:19:27.012 --> 01:19:28.253
Number eight!

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:32.678
Come to the blackboard and give us

01:19:33.018 --> 01:19:35.431
the correct answer!

01:19:36.814 --> 01:19:37.850
Come on!

01:19:38.607 --> 01:19:40.724
We're waiting!

01:19:43.153 --> 01:19:46.066
Six times eight is 48!

01:19:46.824 --> 01:19:48.781
And if I tell you

01:19:49.368 --> 01:19:51.405
that it is 40?

01:19:51.787 --> 01:19:53.949
Then it would still be 48.

01:19:54.665 --> 01:19:57.499
You think you are so smart, don't you?

01:20:00.337 --> 01:20:01.919
Have you already forgotten

01:20:02.923 --> 01:20:04.880
what you learned?

01:20:05.384 --> 01:20:06.500
Tell me,

01:20:07.344 --> 01:20:12.135
who are the supreme lords of creation?

01:20:12.474 --> 01:20:13.590
The dragons?

01:20:13.976 --> 01:20:15.638
Do you really believe that?

01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:17.352
Of course!

01:20:17.688 --> 01:20:19.020
Then you are wrong!

01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:21.523
The supreme lords of creation

01:20:21.942 --> 01:20:24.150
are cockroaches.

01:20:25.112 --> 01:20:27.479
They can survive
disasters and wildfires.

01:20:27.865 --> 01:20:29.322
And they will survive dragons, too.

01:20:29.658 --> 01:20:30.865
No matter what you say!

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:33.117
Don't be fresh!

01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:36.697
I've had enough of your arrogance!

01:20:37.708 --> 01:20:40.951
You need to be punished!

01:20:42.838 --> 01:20:44.045
Yes!

01:20:46.175 --> 01:20:47.757
Stop!
- Who is that?

01:20:51.472 --> 01:20:52.508
Who is that?

01:20:52.890 --> 01:20:55.678
How dare you?

01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:57.926
Who are you?

01:20:58.479 --> 01:20:59.595
I'm Jim Button,

01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:01.846
and I'm here to free Princess Li Si

01:21:02.399 --> 01:21:05.312
and all these other children as well!
- Did you hear that?

01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:06.943
Quiet!

01:21:07.446 --> 01:21:10.860
Do you think you human children

01:21:11.533 --> 01:21:13.024
are something better?

01:21:14.495 --> 01:21:17.238
You think you can replace us,

01:21:17.581 --> 01:21:20.324
hunt us, destroy us.

01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:25.545
But us dragons are much smarter
and stronger than you!

01:21:27.674 --> 01:21:29.666
Where do you come from, son?

01:21:36.558 --> 01:21:38.891
And who are your parents?

01:21:39.228 --> 01:21:40.309
I don't know.

01:21:40.854 --> 01:21:44.723
When I was a baby, I was sent in a box
to a Mrs. Grindtooth.

01:21:45.692 --> 01:21:47.854
I am Mrs. Grindtooth!

01:21:48.946 --> 01:21:53.407
I bought you for a large sum
from the Wild 13!

01:21:54.076 --> 01:21:57.569
But I never received my merchandise!

01:21:58.163 --> 01:21:59.574
That means I was kidnapped.

01:21:59.998 --> 01:22:01.489
Where did I come from?

01:22:01.959 --> 01:22:02.995
Who am I?

01:22:03.377 --> 01:22:04.743
And where is my family?

01:22:05.462 --> 01:22:07.374
You are nobody!

01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:10.081
You are mine!

01:22:10.717 --> 01:22:12.003
Watch out!

01:22:14.513 --> 01:22:16.004
Just wait!

01:22:17.266 --> 01:22:20.304
Where are you?

01:22:20.686 --> 01:22:21.893
Hey!

01:22:25.274 --> 01:22:26.355
Stop!

01:22:27.359 --> 01:22:29.146
You won't get far!

01:22:32.448 --> 01:22:34.986
Hurry up, you can do it! Faster!

01:22:36.243 --> 01:22:37.779
Hurry up! Quick!

01:22:38.454 --> 01:22:40.662
Look, son,

01:22:41.123 --> 01:22:43.911
this is where your journey ends.

01:22:44.251 --> 01:22:46.243
Li Si, here! Come!

01:22:46.587 --> 01:22:47.703
Hurry up!

01:22:49.381 --> 01:22:50.622
What are you doing?

01:22:51.925 --> 01:22:53.666
Back to your seats!

01:22:54.011 --> 01:22:56.253
I can't believe this!

01:22:59.725 --> 01:23:01.432
Oh, no!

01:23:02.186 --> 01:23:03.722
Oh, no!

01:23:04.396 --> 01:23:05.682
You wait...

01:23:06.064 --> 01:23:08.397
Luke!
- ... and see!

01:23:15.115 --> 01:23:18.574
Do you think you can escape?

01:23:32.174 --> 01:23:33.415
Yes!

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:46.469
What did he say?

01:23:59.868 --> 01:24:02.076
Jim, we need to tie her up
before she wakes up again.

01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:05.572
Here! Our chains!

01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:07.869
Good idea.

01:24:14.049 --> 01:24:15.506
Here, take this!

01:24:17.844 --> 01:24:18.880
Tighter!

01:24:22.391 --> 01:24:23.552
Those bottles

01:24:23.850 --> 01:24:26.934
with the messages to your father...
Where did you throw them?

01:24:27.354 --> 01:24:29.767
Into the Yellow River behind the school.

01:24:30.524 --> 01:24:33.608
Well, if the message in the bottle
made it to Mandala,

01:24:34.361 --> 01:24:36.353
I reckon we can too.

01:24:37.155 --> 01:24:39.112
And what do we do with Mrs. Grindtooth?

01:24:39.866 --> 01:24:42.108
If we leave her here,
she'll raise the alarm.

01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:44.201
Don't worry,

01:24:44.621 --> 01:24:47.034
I'm sure the old trout
would like to see the world.

01:25:30.959 --> 01:25:32.245
Quick!

01:25:34.421 --> 01:25:35.457
Come on!

01:25:45.349 --> 01:25:46.385
Hold on!

01:25:47.809 --> 01:25:49.892
Emma! Come on, Emma!

01:25:56.943 --> 01:25:58.809
Careful! Get down!

01:26:04.826 --> 01:26:06.158
Everything alright up there?

01:26:06.495 --> 01:26:07.702
Yeah!

01:26:27.307 --> 01:26:28.593
You look just like me.

01:26:29.518 --> 01:26:30.804
Where are you from?

01:26:31.269 --> 01:26:33.226
From the Land of Lions and Elephants.

01:26:33.522 --> 01:26:35.354
So how did Mrs. Grindtooth catch you?

01:26:35.649 --> 01:26:39.393
I was swimming in the ocean
when a huge pirate ship came by.

01:26:39.945 --> 01:26:41.402
I had hardly seen it

01:26:41.738 --> 01:26:44.071
when they already threw
a net over my head.

01:26:44.491 --> 01:26:47.905
I was fishing in my canoe
when the pirates caught me.

01:26:48.495 --> 01:26:50.361
Yes, those scary pirates!

01:26:51.748 --> 01:26:53.865
Hang on, it's about to get rough!

01:27:18.859 --> 01:27:20.646
Yes!

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:26.981
Looks like we made it!

01:27:27.325 --> 01:27:29.783
Next stop, Mandala!
- Yes!

01:28:07.407 --> 01:28:08.443
Dad?

01:28:15.999 --> 01:28:16.989
Dad!

01:28:23.507 --> 01:28:24.543
Li Si!

01:28:29.930 --> 01:28:32.172
Li Si! Li Si...

01:28:33.058 --> 01:28:34.424
Li Si!

01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:36.801
My little Li Si!

01:28:38.021 --> 01:28:39.603
My Li Si is back.

01:28:42.442 --> 01:28:43.432
Li Si!

01:28:47.364 --> 01:28:49.276
His Majesty speaks again! Hooray!

01:28:49.616 --> 01:28:51.357
He speaks again!

01:28:51.701 --> 01:28:54.068
Ping Pong. What happened to you?

01:28:54.579 --> 01:28:58.118
His Majesty has made me
his Chief Mandarin.

01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:01.208
Dad, Jim saved us.

01:29:03.839 --> 01:29:06.377
Tell me, how can I show my gratitude?

01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:08.962
Let him marry me!

01:29:10.762 --> 01:29:14.551
Aren't you a little young to marry?

01:29:16.101 --> 01:29:19.469
They can decide for themselves later.
- Excellent idea!

01:29:20.605 --> 01:29:21.686
Well, alright.

01:29:22.983 --> 01:29:26.977
Would you like to play with my dolls?

01:29:27.445 --> 01:29:28.606
Yes, of course.

01:29:29.197 --> 01:29:30.608
I have over a thousand,

01:29:30.991 --> 01:29:33.278
and I'll introduce you to each one!

01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:35.196
Dear children.

01:29:35.579 --> 01:29:38.242
Happiness has returned to our hearts.

01:29:38.874 --> 01:29:41.537
I am sure you want to see
your families

01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:43.576
who are missing you.

01:29:44.379 --> 01:29:45.460
Chief!

01:29:45.797 --> 01:29:48.335
The children
are allowed to use the imperial fleet.

01:29:48.758 --> 01:29:53.219
Bring everyone back
to their home country.

01:29:53.889 --> 01:29:55.630
Yeah!

01:30:05.817 --> 01:30:09.185
Honorable friends,
you have to come right away!

01:30:09.571 --> 01:30:11.813
What happened?
- The dragon...

01:30:12.407 --> 01:30:16.401
The Scholarly Flowers
believe it is dying.

01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:20.159
She is dying. Have you heard?
Mrs. Grindtooth is dying.

01:30:35.013 --> 01:30:36.379
Look, Luke.

01:30:37.724 --> 01:30:39.181
Thank you.

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:41.767
Thank you for what?

01:30:42.479 --> 01:30:46.063
For defeating me

01:30:46.816 --> 01:30:48.728
without killing me.

01:30:50.195 --> 01:30:52.562
Nobody who is evil

01:30:53.490 --> 01:30:56.858
is very happy, you must know.

01:30:57.953 --> 01:31:00.787
Us dragons are only evil

01:31:01.539 --> 01:31:05.408
until somebody comes and defeats us.

01:31:07.545 --> 01:31:10.333
This happens once every 1,000 years,

01:31:11.508 --> 01:31:14.842
and then something wonderful begins...

01:31:15.929 --> 01:31:17.841
But you're not going to die, are you?

01:31:18.515 --> 01:31:20.472
Oh, please, don't die!

01:31:20.809 --> 01:31:22.300
Don't worry.

01:31:23.687 --> 01:31:25.474
I will transform

01:31:26.022 --> 01:31:28.981
into a Golden Dragon of Wisdom

01:31:29.985 --> 01:31:32.944
with knowledge of all mysteries
and secrets.

01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:35.237
Soon,

01:31:36.449 --> 01:31:39.066
I will fall into a deep sleep.

01:31:41.371 --> 01:31:44.990
Nobody shall touch me during that time.

01:31:47.210 --> 01:31:48.701
One year later,

01:31:50.005 --> 01:31:51.496
I will wake up.

01:31:52.799 --> 01:31:55.462
Then I will be reborn.

01:31:58.179 --> 01:31:59.295
Oh, Mrs. Grindtooth,

01:32:00.140 --> 01:32:04.100
could you please answer one question
before you sleep? Please!

01:32:04.728 --> 01:32:07.311
I am so tired.

01:32:09.107 --> 01:32:11.440
But maybe one last question...

01:32:15.155 --> 01:32:17.818
Ask her, Jim. You earned it.

01:32:19.701 --> 01:32:22.944
Mrs. Grindtooth,
could you please tell me

01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:28.120
how Luke and Emma and I
could all live together in Morrowland?

01:32:29.919 --> 01:32:33.503
But Jim, you always wanted to know
where you are from.

01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:35.047
Now is your chance.

01:32:35.383 --> 01:32:37.545
Please answer this one question.

01:32:40.305 --> 01:32:44.140
Set sail at sunset.

01:32:44.768 --> 01:32:47.431
On the second day of your journey home,

01:32:48.146 --> 01:32:50.229
at noon,

01:32:51.566 --> 01:32:55.651
at 321 degrees Western longitude

01:32:56.821 --> 01:33:01.191
and 123 degrees Northern latitude,

01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:04.698
you will come across a floating island.

01:33:05.622 --> 01:33:07.329
But hurry up

01:33:07.874 --> 01:33:09.581
or it will pass

01:33:10.376 --> 01:33:13.084
and you will never find it again.

01:33:13.630 --> 01:33:17.044
Please forgive me.
The waters of the Golden River

01:33:17.842 --> 01:33:19.629
have quenched my fire.

01:33:21.387 --> 01:33:23.094
I'm so awfully...

01:33:25.558 --> 01:33:26.969
tired.

01:34:12.564 --> 01:34:14.396
Mrs. Whaat! Mrs. Whaat!

01:34:16.317 --> 01:34:17.603
Oh, Jim,

01:34:18.611 --> 01:34:21.649
I hear your voice so often in my dreams.

01:34:22.031 --> 01:34:24.239
And now I even hear you when I'm awake.

01:34:24.993 --> 01:34:27.781
It's me, Mrs. Whaat! Jim!

01:34:28.163 --> 01:34:30.155
Mrs. Whaat! We're back!

01:34:34.252 --> 01:34:36.414
Mrs. Whaat, it's me, Jim!

01:34:39.465 --> 01:34:41.047
Jim!

01:34:41.509 --> 01:34:42.875
Jim.

01:34:43.928 --> 01:34:47.012
King Alfons, Mr. Sleeve! They're back!

01:34:57.650 --> 01:34:58.936
An invasion!

01:34:59.485 --> 01:35:02.102
An attack!
All hands on deck!

01:35:02.405 --> 01:35:05.398
Every duty
needs to do its citizen for Morrowland!

01:35:07.493 --> 01:35:10.657
You Highness! The Emperor of Mandala
is here for an official visit!

01:35:11.789 --> 01:35:12.870
Official visit?

01:35:17.253 --> 01:35:19.085
Oh, yes. My crown

01:35:19.964 --> 01:35:21.671
and my raptor... I mean, scepter!

01:35:28.306 --> 01:35:29.513
Come here.

01:35:30.767 --> 01:35:33.009
You are back, how wonderful!

01:35:36.564 --> 01:35:38.681
Make way for His Royal Highness!

01:35:42.946 --> 01:35:46.690
Luke, Jim, Emma!

01:35:48.326 --> 01:35:50.067
Can you ever forgive me?

01:35:50.370 --> 01:35:51.736
But of course, Your Highness!

01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:54.037
I forgive you.
And so do Jim and Emma.

01:35:56.918 --> 01:35:58.284
Goodness gracious!

01:35:59.254 --> 01:36:02.292
What kind of territorial growth is that?

01:36:02.632 --> 01:36:04.089
A floating island!

01:36:04.717 --> 01:36:07.175
The Golden Dragon of Wisdom
told us where to find it.

01:36:07.512 --> 01:36:08.878
Oh, yes, of course, yes.

01:36:09.264 --> 01:36:10.471
Your Majesty,

01:36:10.807 --> 01:36:14.426
allow me to extend your kingdom
by this island.

01:36:14.769 --> 01:36:19.514
Dear Luke, your wish is hereby granted.

01:36:21.276 --> 01:36:24.360
So I will call myself King of Morrowland

01:36:25.113 --> 01:36:28.106
and New-Morrowland in the future.
- Cheers!

01:36:28.825 --> 01:36:33.365
Majesty, the Emperor of Mandala
and his daughter, Princess Li Si.

01:36:33.871 --> 01:36:35.988
Pardon?
- Emperor of Mandala.

01:36:38.876 --> 01:36:42.165
It's beautiful here, King Alfons.

01:36:43.464 --> 01:36:45.000
Please call me Alfy.

01:36:45.341 --> 01:36:48.960
May I invite you and your charming
cup of tea for a daughter?

01:36:51.055 --> 01:36:54.093
No, I mean...
For a piece of castle in my cake!

01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:57.096
That would be wonderful!

01:36:57.437 --> 01:36:59.178
Follow me.

01:37:12.869 --> 01:37:15.987
Bang, bang. -Bang, bang.
- Yes! Bang, bang.

01:37:16.706 --> 01:37:18.993
Vivat!

01:37:25.173 --> 01:37:29.543
<i>The emperor returned home,
but Li Si stayed a bit in Morrowland</i>

01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:32.427
<i>with King Alfons.</i>

01:37:32.847 --> 01:37:35.965
<i>Of course, it got a bit tight,
but nobody seemed to mind.</i>

01:37:36.517 --> 01:37:39.931
<i>The little princess
loved Morrowland immensely.</i>

01:38:05.588 --> 01:38:07.295
Bang!

01:38:19.602 --> 01:38:20.843
Faster!

01:38:35.118 --> 01:38:37.485
<i>Four weeks went by in an instant,</i>

01:38:37.995 --> 01:38:41.284
<i>and then it was time to say goodbye.</i>

01:38:41.624 --> 01:38:42.990
Goodbye!

01:38:43.793 --> 01:38:45.409
Come back for a visit soon!

01:38:45.753 --> 01:38:47.415
Goodbye!
- See you soon!

01:38:47.755 --> 01:38:49.963
Yes, see you soon! Farewell!

01:38:51.717 --> 01:38:53.379
Don't be sad, buddy.

01:38:54.137 --> 01:38:56.595
This ship will come back here
on a regular basis now.

01:39:00.643 --> 01:39:01.975
Jim,

01:39:02.770 --> 01:39:04.807
do me a favor and check on Emma, okay?

01:39:12.572 --> 01:39:14.154
Are you okay, Emma?

01:39:24.333 --> 01:39:26.666
Luke, look at that!

01:39:28.379 --> 01:39:29.711
It's a little Emma!

01:39:34.594 --> 01:39:36.631
Another whimsicality.

01:39:37.763 --> 01:39:39.095
Don't worry, she doesn't bite.

01:39:50.693 --> 01:39:54.312
Soon, she will be as big as Emma.
Then she will need an engine driver.

01:39:55.281 --> 01:39:56.613
Do you have a name for her?

01:39:58.743 --> 01:40:00.154
Molly.

01:40:00.495 --> 01:40:04.284
Yes, I like that.
M, for Molly.

01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:33.438
Will we ever go
on an adventure like that again?

01:40:34.278 --> 01:40:35.814
Someday, I'm sure.

01:40:37.573 --> 01:40:39.815
Jim?
- Yes, Luke?

01:40:40.826 --> 01:40:43.443
Why didn't you ask Mrs. Grindtooth
what you really wanted to know?

01:40:45.206 --> 01:40:46.993
I already know the answer.

01:40:47.667 --> 01:40:49.499
You guys are my real family.

01:40:50.002 --> 01:40:52.836
And Morrowland is my home.

01:41:05.768 --> 01:41:09.432
<i>And so, happiness and peace
returned to Morrowland,</i>

01:41:09.772 --> 01:41:12.810
<i>our small island with two mountains.</i>

01:41:13.359 --> 01:41:15.567
<i>And Jim and Luke agreed</i>

01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:20.030
<i>that they soon would go on another trip
into the unknown.</i>

01:41:20.533 --> 01:41:24.402
<i>There were so many mysteries
that they still wanted to explore.</i>
