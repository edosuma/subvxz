WEBVTT

00:00.175 --> 00:03.751
Look at me, right?
And look at The Queen.

00:04.181 --> 00:08.784
I was never not a fan till it occurred
to me how much we have in common.

00:08.786 --> 00:11.346
Bringing up kiddies you can't
remember the names of.

00:11.356 --> 00:15.198
I know she's not a single parent,
but she might as well be. Plus,

00:15.237 --> 00:17.635
the pair of us,
we've stuck to our guns -

00:17.637 --> 00:19.195
her literally, sometimes -

00:19.197 --> 00:21.435
and flagshipped a dying breed.

00:21.437 --> 00:23.835
Admired and despised equally,

00:23.837 --> 00:26.275
not for never lifting a finger, no!

00:26.277 --> 00:29.275
For setting examples through
extremity.

00:29.277 --> 00:31.955
And whether you're a bigwig on her
end or a bigwig on mine,

00:31.957 --> 00:34.595
you've still got all your dickheads
in the middle to deal with,

00:34.597 --> 00:36.315
snip, snip, snipping at
your benefits.

00:36.317 --> 00:38.755
I mean, she can't not be
looking at me and thinking,

00:38.757 --> 00:42.035
"What's your secret,
Frank?" I got shot

00:42.037 --> 00:43.755
of my kids yonks back,

00:43.757 --> 00:46.275
whereas she's yet to see
the back of a single one.

00:46.277 --> 00:48.555
Fine! I've had to get out of bed
on occasion to

00:48.557 --> 00:50.915
make ends meet,
whereas she... she's done

00:50.917 --> 00:52.477
the whole thing from a chair.

00:54.317 --> 00:56.155
Oh, a drink for the lady.

00:56.157 --> 00:57.635
Oh sure, there's perks.

00:57.637 --> 00:58.675
But look at her lot.

00:58.677 --> 01:01.395
Brian May prancing
about on her roof!

01:01.397 --> 01:07.597
Now, look at my lot. We know how to
throw a proper fucking paaaarty!

If you make me late...

02:10.037 --> 02:12.715
Frank, can this horror walk to
school with you?

02:12.717 --> 02:15.195
Anything to help,
my little Turkish Delight.

02:15.197 --> 02:16.995
I can walk myself.

02:16.997 --> 02:18.955
Not a chance. Spelling test.

02:18.957 --> 02:20.915
Been trying to get
out of it for days. Got to go.

02:20.917 --> 02:22.155
See you back at home.

02:22.157 --> 02:23.195
If I come back.

02:23.197 --> 02:24.475
Promises, promises.

02:24.477 --> 02:25.477
I can spell.

02:28.077 --> 02:29.435
C'mon.

02:29.437 --> 02:32.075
'You have reached your destination.'

02:32.077 --> 02:34.075
Shut up, lady!

02:34.077 --> 02:36.077
'You have reached your destination.'

02:44.877 --> 02:49.997
'It's just a job interview.
Stay calm, Esther. Stay calm.'

02:55.117 --> 02:57.437
You could always try creating
a diversion.

02:58.477 --> 03:00.115
Sorry. It's nerves.

03:00.117 --> 03:01.117
Lovely.

03:02.277 --> 03:03.355
Like what?

03:03.357 --> 03:06.475
Well, our Carl used to hold
his breath until he fainted.

03:06.477 --> 03:08.275
Did it work?

03:08.277 --> 03:10.515
Well, he's thick as fuck,
so yeah, I'd say so.

03:10.517 --> 03:13.077
Get in to class.
The bell's about to go.

03:15.437 --> 03:18.557
Some clever dick's drawn
a picture of me in the toilets.

03:21.277 --> 03:23.995
You can't deny kids
freedom of expression.

03:23.997 --> 03:27.157
The staff toilets.
I want it removed.

03:41.757 --> 03:43.275
Success?

03:43.277 --> 03:46.237
Too shaky.
The one in the toilets was neater.

03:48.157 --> 03:50.075
May I help you?

03:50.077 --> 03:51.595
I'm looking for the janitor.

03:51.597 --> 03:52.635
Frank?

03:52.637 --> 03:53.875
Frank, aye. That's him.

03:53.877 --> 03:55.395
May I ask what it's regarding?

03:55.397 --> 03:56.955
Afraid that's a personal matter.

03:56.957 --> 03:58.155
I'm intrigued.

03:58.157 --> 04:00.555
An urgent personal matter.

04:00.557 --> 04:02.075
What about her?

04:02.077 --> 04:03.235
Been a bit quiet

04:03.237 --> 04:06.317
since she got fingered by Peter
Simcocks at the Christmas Party.

04:09.477 --> 04:12.035
Frank Gallagher to reception.

04:12.037 --> 04:14.437
'That's Frank Gallagher
to reception.'

04:18.716 --> 04:20.875
Please, Miss,
can I go to the toilet?

04:20.877 --> 04:21.877
Be quick.

04:23.517 --> 04:25.195
Is he on his way, love?

04:25.197 --> 04:27.957
I'm sure he won't be long
if he knows it's urgent.

04:42.517 --> 04:45.275
Make your way to the nearest exit.

04:45.277 --> 04:48.875
Oi! Setting off the alarm's
immediate suspension.

04:48.877 --> 04:50.995
I'm calling your mother.

04:50.997 --> 04:53.035
I need to talk to Frank!

04:53.037 --> 04:55.237
And I need you to step outside.

04:56.477 --> 04:58.197
Walk, not run!

05:06.197 --> 05:07.197
Come on!

05:08.437 --> 05:10.955
Sir, I need you to move!

05:10.957 --> 05:12.755
Everyone back into class!

05:12.757 --> 05:14.755
We still need to follow protocol.

05:14.757 --> 05:17.675
Everybody back in! In!

05:17.677 --> 05:18.715
Out!

05:18.717 --> 05:19.755
In!

05:19.757 --> 05:20.795
Out!

05:20.797 --> 05:22.075
Everybody back in!

05:22.077 --> 05:23.115
Out!

05:23.117 --> 05:26.115
Back in! Back in!

05:26.117 --> 05:27.117
..Protocol!

05:30.717 --> 05:32.475
It's a gun!

05:32.477 --> 05:33.475
He's got a gun!

05:33.477 --> 05:35.317
There's a man with a gun!

05:45.037 --> 05:46.037
Let me out!

06:15.917 --> 06:18.035
That one. That window there.

06:18.037 --> 06:19.075
Here you are, Frank.

06:19.077 --> 06:20.835
Cheers. I mean, I felt terrible,
you know,

06:20.837 --> 06:23.035
but there's only so many
I could get to, you know.

06:23.037 --> 06:25.035
They didn't want to jump
but I told them,

06:25.037 --> 06:28.355
"There's a madman with a gun about
to blow your fucking brains out!"

06:28.357 --> 06:30.835
I mean, rather a broken ankle, eh?

06:30.837 --> 06:32.717
Our hero! Mwah!

06:34.917 --> 06:36.595
Look at that. That's perfect,
that is.

06:36.597 --> 06:37.835
Oh, the romance!

06:37.837 --> 06:41.277
Romance? Fuck romance! Look where it
got me! That's the future.

06:47.157 --> 06:48.475
Where's the negotiator?

06:48.477 --> 06:50.755
10 minutes away. Had to drag him
out of an antenatal.

06:50.757 --> 06:53.275
On call does not mean sitting
in a room full of men feeling

06:53.277 --> 06:55.835
sympathetic about other
women's fannies.

06:55.837 --> 06:57.075
Everyone accounted for?

06:57.077 --> 06:59.755
Thalia Blanco went to the toilet
just before the alarm went off.

06:59.757 --> 07:01.915
I haven't seen her since.

07:01.917 --> 07:03.595
I thought she was lying!

07:03.597 --> 07:07.595
This mad bitch locked my daughter in
a cupboard with a fucking gunman!

07:07.597 --> 07:09.315
I didn't know there was a gunman!

07:09.317 --> 07:11.035
She set the fire alarms off!

07:11.037 --> 07:12.075
And that makes it OK?

07:12.077 --> 07:15.555
Ladies, ladies! OK?
Lock the place down.

07:15.557 --> 07:16.677
Lock the place down.

07:27.477 --> 07:28.555
Where's Mimi?

07:28.557 --> 07:30.715
Oh, she's in there with the pigs,
helping them out.

07:30.717 --> 07:32.475
Incident van? Ah, sick!

07:32.477 --> 07:34.115
Shouldn't you be checking on Stella?

07:34.117 --> 07:36.835
Nah, she'll be fine. She'll be on
her way home by now.

07:36.837 --> 07:40.595
Look at them all gawping.
It's fucking awful!

07:40.597 --> 07:42.957
Want a drink? Look, they're going in!

07:44.477 --> 07:45.557
Go, go!

07:47.197 --> 07:49.475
OK, lads. Easy does it.

07:49.477 --> 07:50.517
Hurry!

07:56.997 --> 07:58.395
What are they waiting for?

07:58.397 --> 07:59.597
They're nearly there.

08:03.197 --> 08:05.395
The good thing is
we know Thalia's exact location.

08:05.397 --> 08:06.675
Ah, that's lucky.

08:06.677 --> 08:07.675
Lucky?

08:07.677 --> 08:10.475
Well, would you rather her be
running round willy nilly in there?

08:10.477 --> 08:12.675
I will kill you with my bare hands!

08:12.677 --> 08:14.117
Get off, you fucking nobhead!

08:18.837 --> 08:21.275
'Yeah. Yeah, we've got the girl.'

08:21.277 --> 08:22.635
Ah! Oh!

08:22.637 --> 08:23.637
Yes!

08:25.397 --> 08:26.595
Did you see that?

08:26.597 --> 08:29.557
I'm going to overlook it on this
occasion. Well done, lads.

08:30.677 --> 08:33.395
Fancy a bit of Cajun music tonight,
in here?

08:33.397 --> 08:34.674
Fiver each?

08:34.677 --> 08:36.995
Oh, yeah. We'll take two.

08:36.996 --> 08:39.395
I thought we could have a hero's
welcome back at the ranch?

08:39.397 --> 08:42.275
You know the rules, Frank.
Thursday night's girls' night.

08:42.277 --> 08:43.674
Friends before fannies!

08:43.677 --> 08:44.755
Ohh!

08:44.757 --> 08:48.555
'The police have confirmed there
has been no sighting of a gunman.

08:48.557 --> 08:50.677
'It now looks as
though it was a hoax.'

08:53.477 --> 08:55.835
What? I saw him with me own eyes!

08:55.837 --> 08:56.877
Tosser!

09:02.277 --> 09:04.795
So neither you,
or any other member of staff,

09:04.797 --> 09:06.477
actually saw a man with a gun?

09:09.597 --> 09:11.877
Could have got the King's Medal
for this.

09:17.557 --> 09:18.957
I'm making tea, Daddy.

09:20.957 --> 09:22.037
You must be Frank.

09:27.623 --> 09:28.603
Tea?

09:28.702 --> 09:29.702
Yes, please.

09:36.822 --> 09:38.142
Ahh!

09:38.244 --> 09:39.602
De-licious!

09:39.604 --> 09:42.204
Wonder if your dad doesn't have
something stronger, though.

09:47.604 --> 09:50.282
Now, now. That is not
very hospitable.

09:50.284 --> 09:51.322
Listen, mate...

09:51.324 --> 09:53.724
I am not your mate, pal.

09:53.842 --> 09:54.842
Easy, easy!

09:56.722 --> 09:58.322
I don't even know who you are, mate!

10:00.242 --> 10:03.242
I think there's been some
kind of misunderstanding.

10:04.962 --> 10:06.202
No misunderstanding.

10:07.762 --> 10:09.560
We need to have a little chat.

10:09.562 --> 10:10.760
Yeah?

10:10.762 --> 10:14.400
You'll enjoy that, won't you?
I hear you're very chatty.

10:14.402 --> 10:15.762
Quite the wee pundit.

10:18.762 --> 10:20.000
No wiser?

10:20.002 --> 10:22.160
Well, let's see
if we can't jog your memory.

10:22.162 --> 10:25.722
I'll just consult my big
book of Frank's Opinions.

10:28.802 --> 10:30.282
"You're too good for him."

10:33.762 --> 10:35.842
"You should move in with me,
Derrilee."

10:37.402 --> 10:38.440
Biddy?

10:38.442 --> 10:42.560
My name's Baxter and you've been
pumping my missus, Frank!

10:42.562 --> 10:44.200
The whoring's one thing.

10:44.202 --> 10:47.520
We've got to make a living and dogs
like you have to get their hole.

10:47.522 --> 10:50.000
But her moving out of my house
and in with you,

10:50.002 --> 10:52.200
I'm not standing for it!

10:52.202 --> 10:53.962
Fuck, it was you at the school!

10:55.122 --> 10:56.880
Yeah, that went a bit tits.

10:56.882 --> 10:58.520
I'd never hurt a kiddie, though.

10:58.522 --> 11:01.282
I'm going to go and play with Lillian
and the alligator.

11:02.722 --> 11:04.840
No, you don't want to do that,
darling.

11:04.842 --> 11:06.282
Stay here with your old dad.

11:08.082 --> 11:10.520
You're a class act, Frank.

11:10.522 --> 11:11.522
Sit down.

11:15.042 --> 11:17.160
That was worst shoot-out ever.

11:17.162 --> 11:18.520
Bloody vultures.

11:18.522 --> 11:20.040
What? You were watching as well!

11:20.042 --> 11:22.280
Err, I'm a trained health care
professional.

11:22.282 --> 11:23.402
We were here to help.

11:26.082 --> 11:27.082
Bullshit!

11:31.482 --> 11:32.722
No gunman, I believe.

11:33.802 --> 11:35.440
No negotiation required.

11:35.442 --> 11:37.880
So you can toddle back
to your panting exercises and let me

11:37.882 --> 11:39.402
get on with standing down my unit.

11:40.562 --> 11:41.962
Au contraire, Veronica!

11:43.322 --> 11:46.602
The Guv'nor thought you might need
a little help with the paperwork.

11:50.242 --> 11:52.682
Get that fucking jingle jangle
switched off!

11:57.042 --> 11:59.202
'You have reached your destination.'

12:04.402 --> 12:07.562
There's a dead kid.
No, wait, it's a little postman.

12:08.682 --> 12:10.162
He's definitely dead, though.

12:12.042 --> 12:14.440
Start with a one-mile
radius of the school.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.722
The prick is most likely on foot.
Come on!

12:17.922 --> 12:19.042
And get me a chopper!

12:23.322 --> 12:27.360
It was a professional arrangement.
Only ever on a Friday.

12:27.362 --> 12:28.960
Only ever with Sherrilee.

12:28.962 --> 12:31.440
I mean, she's just staying here
because she said...

12:31.442 --> 12:33.320
She said what, exactly?

12:33.322 --> 12:35.282
She's just a lodger. Nothing more.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.440
I need the toilet.

12:38.442 --> 12:40.000
I told her to go back to you.

12:40.002 --> 12:43.160
I said, "Derr, it's nothing to do
with me but Biddy...

12:43.162 --> 12:46.842
"Baxter, he sounds like
he's the one."

12:48.682 --> 12:50.080
What did she say?

12:50.082 --> 12:51.920
That you're a prick.

12:51.922 --> 12:53.482
Why don't you go and have a piss, eh?

12:55.322 --> 12:56.360
She tell you I hit her?

12:56.362 --> 12:57.400
Yeah.

12:57.402 --> 12:58.402
No.

13:00.522 --> 13:03.240
Look, I don't have to tell you
what Derrilee's like.

13:03.242 --> 13:06.240
You're saying my wife deserves
a thumping, does she?

13:06.242 --> 13:10.080
No. I am not here to judge.

13:10.082 --> 13:13.360
You two need to talk.
She's in the Jockey.

13:13.362 --> 13:15.320
With Sherrilee?

13:15.322 --> 13:20.320
Yeah, yeah. She's as bad. She'll
have been yack-yacking in her ear.

13:20.322 --> 13:22.282
You get Derr to come here,
on her own.

13:23.962 --> 13:25.400
What you going to do?

13:25.402 --> 13:27.202
I thought you weren't here to judge.

13:30.162 --> 13:31.480
Your turn.

13:31.482 --> 13:33.040
Him.

13:33.042 --> 13:36.440
I reckon.... average length,
generous girth.

13:36.442 --> 13:39.240
Thick thatch, though.
Makes it look stubbier than it is.

13:39.242 --> 13:40.480
Agreed.

13:40.482 --> 13:41.720
And the little brother?

13:41.722 --> 13:43.442
Only by order of birth.

13:47.322 --> 13:48.362
Ooh!

13:49.682 --> 13:51.560
Not tonight, Josephine.

13:51.562 --> 13:54.320
'You'll just have to wait till
tomorrow for the full nine yards.'

13:54.322 --> 13:57.642
Or seven inches, respectable width
and big clanging balls.

14:00.122 --> 14:01.520
Stella's poorly.

14:01.522 --> 14:02.680
Poorly?

14:02.682 --> 14:03.720
'Yeah, she's...'

14:03.722 --> 14:07.400
she's running a temperature.
You know, she's asking for you.

14:07.402 --> 14:09.200
'Dad's hopeless
in these situations.'

14:09.202 --> 14:12.040
Kids need the... lodger.

14:12.042 --> 14:13.600
'We'll come over.'

14:13.602 --> 14:17.240
No, no, no. Just you.
I don't want

14:17.242 --> 14:19.360
'Sherrilee catching anything.'

14:19.362 --> 14:20.400
'All right.'

14:20.402 --> 14:21.402
Cheers.

14:24.042 --> 14:25.162
Yeah!

14:26.962 --> 14:30.440
Jump! Jump!

14:30.442 --> 14:31.480
You going to drink this?

14:31.482 --> 14:32.842
Maybes aye, maybes not.

14:40.642 --> 14:43.442
I stopped off at Chesco to pick
these up for Stella.

14:45.122 --> 14:46.480
Oooh!

14:46.482 --> 14:49.002
Spoonful of each,
she'll be right as rain.

14:54.122 --> 14:55.202
All right, darlin'?

14:56.282 --> 14:58.122
No big winch for your old man?

15:02.162 --> 15:03.642
Put the lassie down, Derr.

15:06.562 --> 15:08.400
Go and play upstairs, love.

15:08.402 --> 15:10.800
I was just explaining to
Baxter about you and me, you know.

15:10.802 --> 15:13.960
Nothing going on there.
You know, professional arrangement.

15:13.962 --> 15:15.240
So I should leave you two...

15:15.242 --> 15:16.800
You're all right, Frank.

15:16.802 --> 15:19.160
Derr's just going to tell us
how she's been a silly bitch

15:19.162 --> 15:21.562
then get her stuff
and come home with me.

15:22.762 --> 15:26.080
Yeah, I think that probably sounds
best, Derr, don't you?

15:26.082 --> 15:27.402
You know, considering.

15:28.722 --> 15:32.520
You got a lot of years together.
Worth fighting for.

15:32.522 --> 15:36.882
A man just needs to know
that his missus loves him.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.560
Is that what you want to hear?

15:44.562 --> 15:45.562
Aye.

15:48.642 --> 15:50.000
Fuck you.

15:50.002 --> 15:51.442
You didn't mean that, Derrilee.

15:54.722 --> 15:57.160
Bent like a banana
and facing the wrong way.

15:57.162 --> 15:59.040
Neither use nor ornament.

15:59.042 --> 16:00.920
Derrilee MacIvor?

16:00.922 --> 16:02.160
She's gone home.

16:02.162 --> 16:05.360
We've just come from there. What's
your relationship with Mrs MacIvor?

16:05.362 --> 16:08.440
Best friend. Born in the same
hospital, not two minutes apart.

16:08.442 --> 16:09.520
Practically sisters.

16:09.522 --> 16:11.402
We need to ask you some questions.

16:15.722 --> 16:18.880
What were you going to do?
Stay here with him?

16:18.882 --> 16:19.962
You want her, do you?

16:21.722 --> 16:23.080
Well?

16:23.082 --> 16:24.202
No.

16:27.122 --> 16:29.682
Not even this
streak of piss wants you.

16:35.802 --> 16:37.440
He's never done this before.

16:37.442 --> 16:40.360
School shootings tend not to be
a repeat offence.

16:40.362 --> 16:41.800
That's good, then.

16:41.802 --> 16:45.960
Do you have any idea why he might
have an issue with children,

16:45.962 --> 16:48.160
anything in the marriage, maybe?

16:48.162 --> 16:49.600
His own childhood?

16:49.602 --> 16:51.680
He's fine with the kiddies.

16:51.682 --> 16:53.160
I mean, they get on his nerves,

16:53.162 --> 16:55.520
but it's a professional hazard,
innit, in that van?

16:55.522 --> 16:57.800
They're always giving him euros
and sheckles.

16:57.802 --> 17:00.800
He's come home with toy money twice.

17:00.802 --> 17:01.842
Is this helping?

17:02.962 --> 17:07.720
You're doing great. It's important
we get a profile, understand him.

17:07.722 --> 17:12.800
Oh, for fuck's sake!
Have you any clue where he might be?

17:12.801 --> 17:14.520
Have you tried his house?

17:14.521 --> 17:15.722
There's no-one home.

17:16.801 --> 17:18.440
Look, this guy popped a dwarf

17:18.442 --> 17:20.960
and then went into a school
with a loaded gun.

17:20.962 --> 17:22.280
We need to find him.

17:22.281 --> 17:27.160
Ah! You went to his place?
That's why you didn't find Derr.

17:27.162 --> 17:30.080
She's moved out. She's at Frank's.

17:30.082 --> 17:32.762
Right! Moving out!

17:39.162 --> 17:42.720
Thing is, Derr,
if you just go home with Biddy now,

17:42.722 --> 17:44.802
while no-one knows he's here and...

17:46.082 --> 17:47.402
Police! Open the door!

17:50.082 --> 17:52.600
He's got a gun
and there's a child in here!

17:52.602 --> 17:54.362
He's got a gun! Clear the area!

18:02.242 --> 18:03.242
Come on! Quick!

18:14.962 --> 18:17.080
Can't believe you're letting
the police in here.

18:17.082 --> 18:20.442
Our neighbours are in danger.
Get Cilla the Jockey straight away.

18:22.722 --> 18:24.520
Err... Shall I get the kettle on?

18:24.522 --> 18:25.800
That won't be necessary.

18:25.802 --> 18:28.440
Friend of the family.
Might be helpful.

18:28.442 --> 18:29.602
Look after this one.

18:31.722 --> 18:33.682
Attempting to establish contact.

18:38.562 --> 18:41.000
Look,
you've not actually done anything.

18:41.002 --> 18:43.240
You know, you came over,
we had a chat, we had a drink.

18:43.242 --> 18:44.800
Had a gun.

18:44.802 --> 18:47.362
Yeah, but he's not used it.

18:49.002 --> 18:50.922
You talk to them.

18:57.442 --> 18:58.600
Hello?

18:58.602 --> 18:59.880
'Baxter?'

18:59.882 --> 19:00.882
No, it's Frank.

19:01.922 --> 19:03.440
Is Baxter there?

19:03.442 --> 19:05.280
Yeah, he's here.

19:05.282 --> 19:06.402
'And he has a firearm?'

19:08.002 --> 19:09.080
Err... that's right.

19:09.082 --> 19:11.240
Tell them I haven't done anything.

19:11.242 --> 19:13.920
But he hasn't done anything
with the firearm.

19:13.922 --> 19:15.600
'Top bloke, really.'

19:15.602 --> 19:17.600
Can you confirm who else
is with you?

19:17.602 --> 19:18.640
'Baxter,'

19:18.642 --> 19:21.560
obviously. Derrilee,
that's his wife, and Stella,

19:21.562 --> 19:22.640
me daughter.

19:22.642 --> 19:25.440
Is Baxter able to hear me?

19:25.442 --> 19:26.800
No.

19:26.802 --> 19:28.680
'I'm going to be very open with you,
Frank.'

19:28.682 --> 19:32.000
Baxter is a very dangerous man.
He killed a postman.

19:32.002 --> 19:34.200
'We found the body underneath
the ice-cream van.'

19:34.202 --> 19:35.362
Did I fuck!

19:38.162 --> 19:39.442
Christ! Fucking...

19:41.362 --> 19:43.122
Jesus Christ! Oh, fuck!

19:45.002 --> 19:46.762
'You have reached your destination.'

19:51.362 --> 19:56.240
Shite! Shite, shite, shite, shite!

19:56.242 --> 19:59.640
Boosh! This shit just got real, bro.
He's shot Little Albert.

19:59.642 --> 20:00.640
Mum?

20:00.642 --> 20:01.720
What, the postman?

20:01.722 --> 20:02.760
Yeah.

20:02.762 --> 20:05.360
See, it's OK.
He doesn't want to shoot children.

20:05.362 --> 20:08.320
Nah, nah, incorrecto!
He shot Little Albert.

20:08.322 --> 20:10.440
He probably thought
he was shooting a little kid.

20:10.442 --> 20:12.560
Everyone, he shot Little Albert!

20:12.562 --> 20:15.362
Yo! He shot Little Albert, everyone!

20:24.882 --> 20:27.720
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

20:27.722 --> 20:29.042
You should have just gone.

20:30.682 --> 20:33.122
Well, they think I'm a murderer...

20:39.202 --> 20:40.722
..so nobody's going anywhere now.

20:44.002 --> 20:46.122
We were happy then, Derr, weren't we?

20:47.282 --> 20:52.802
Roxy Music at the
Apollo, September 30th, 1982.

20:53.882 --> 20:59.080
First time I saw her and I knew.
It was destiny.

20:59.082 --> 21:03.440
She hitched all the way to Glasgow,
daft on Bryan Ferry.

21:03.442 --> 21:06.760
Got something right,
though, big Bryan.

21:06.762 --> 21:08.760
Love is the drug.

21:08.762 --> 21:09.882
Yours is like smack.

21:12.282 --> 21:14.720
Course, she wanted to
be near to Mother.

21:14.722 --> 21:17.280
So I left my own mammy behind,
moved south,

21:17.282 --> 21:18.520
did what she wanted.

21:18.522 --> 21:19.960
Well, you did your best.

21:19.962 --> 21:21.602
I did. Slainte.

21:24.002 --> 21:25.402
Maybe we could go, Frank.

21:27.042 --> 21:28.080
Eh?

21:28.082 --> 21:31.240
Scotland. Take Stella on a holiday.

21:31.242 --> 21:33.960
I could pop in on your mammy, Biddy.

21:33.962 --> 21:35.880
Send her your love from prison.

21:35.882 --> 21:38.680
I thought you said there was
nothing between you two.

21:38.682 --> 21:39.682
There isn't!

21:45.202 --> 21:47.560
Scuse me, scuse me! Coming through!

21:47.562 --> 21:49.360
Make way, yeah? Siege delivery.

21:49.362 --> 21:50.400
Yes, Gazza!

21:50.402 --> 21:52.600
Hey, there's some guy over there
renting seats out.

21:52.602 --> 21:53.640
Go grab one and sit down.

21:53.642 --> 21:55.320
Got one of the bevvies out first.

21:55.322 --> 21:56.720
You all right, kid?

21:56.722 --> 21:59.522
Yeah, we're just gutted he can't be
in there, popping this guy.

22:01.202 --> 22:04.640
The little one will be OK.
I'm saying a prayer.

22:04.642 --> 22:05.760
Excuse me!

22:05.762 --> 22:06.800
Oh, for fuck's sake!

22:06.802 --> 22:08.640
Get out the way!

22:08.642 --> 22:10.082
I'm the mother!

22:12.402 --> 22:14.160
I'm the mother!

22:14.162 --> 22:15.440
I've got the mother here.

22:15.442 --> 22:18.120
It's my baby in that house!

22:18.122 --> 22:19.202
OK, come through.

22:22.882 --> 22:24.560
Is that Stella's mum?

22:24.562 --> 22:27.762
Don't know. Never met her.
Don't think Stella has, either.

22:30.848 --> 22:32.126
I saw it on the news

22:32.128 --> 22:34.766
and I just had to get here,
to my baby.

22:34.768 --> 22:36.686
You did the right thing.

22:36.688 --> 22:38.486
Got anything stronger?

22:38.488 --> 22:43.126
It can sometimes help if a
relative, a mother in particular,

22:43.128 --> 22:45.846
makes a direct plea to
the perpetrator.

22:45.848 --> 22:47.486
On the TV?

22:47.488 --> 22:50.046
On the phone,
but sometimes on the TV.

22:50.048 --> 22:52.126
I'd do anything for little Stella.

22:52.128 --> 22:54.566
Have you got a recent photograph?

22:54.568 --> 22:57.206
It helps to visualise a good
outcome.

22:57.208 --> 22:58.206
Umm...

22:58.208 --> 23:01.326
I've got one.
It's on my phone, I think.

23:01.328 --> 23:04.766
Is this the slag that's
got my daughter held at gunpoint?

23:04.768 --> 23:06.926
No, that's my business partner.

23:06.928 --> 23:08.126
I'm listening.

23:08.128 --> 23:10.566
How come you ended up on your own,
then?

23:10.568 --> 23:12.406
Not been as lucky as you.

23:12.408 --> 23:14.486
No-one special?

23:14.488 --> 23:17.766
Broken heart. Look, shouldn't we try
and get out of here?

23:17.768 --> 23:20.246
I mean, we're surrounded.
You might as well surrender.

23:20.248 --> 23:21.848
Who was it broke your heart?

23:25.568 --> 23:28.486
There's only ever been one
woman for me. Same as you.

23:28.488 --> 23:30.206
Not same woman, obviously.

23:30.208 --> 23:31.408
Who was she, then?

23:32.568 --> 23:34.206
You dirty bitch!

23:34.208 --> 23:37.206
Frank's told me
all about you, you tramp!

23:37.208 --> 23:39.686
Ladies, if we could just
focus on what is imp...

23:39.688 --> 23:40.686
Tramp?

23:40.688 --> 23:42.686
'You're calling me a tramp?'

23:42.688 --> 23:47.606
Monica? Monica.... Yeah, Monica.
My wife.

23:47.608 --> 23:51.126
You said she was a miserable, old
cow and he hoped she was dead.

23:51.128 --> 23:53.766
Well, that's the pain talking.

23:53.768 --> 23:57.766
We've always been a bit like Burton
and Taylor, me and Mon, you know.

23:57.768 --> 24:00.406
In my home, around my child?

24:00.408 --> 24:03.126
Take a look at yourself before you
get up in my grill!

24:03.128 --> 24:04.326
That's her?

24:04.328 --> 24:05.406
Yeah.

24:05.408 --> 24:07.128
You see? Destiny.

24:09.128 --> 24:12.928
What's he said?
You tell me what he said!

24:14.408 --> 24:15.808
Shh!

24:22.848 --> 24:23.926
Baxter?

24:23.928 --> 24:25.046
No, it's Frank again.

24:25.048 --> 24:26.846
'Is everything OK over there?'

24:26.848 --> 24:28.126
Yeah, good.

24:28.128 --> 24:32.326
'Err... Baxter was wondering if
we could have a chat about some

24:32.328 --> 24:34.126
'of them, erm...'

24:34.128 --> 24:35.246
what do you call them?

24:35.248 --> 24:36.286
Demands.

24:36.288 --> 24:37.328
Demands.

24:39.688 --> 24:44.046
We are prepared to negotiate.
Umm... I would really like to

24:44.048 --> 24:45.448
'chat to Baxter, though.'

24:47.408 --> 24:48.926
'No, he's not up for that.'

24:48.928 --> 24:51.488
OK. What are his demands?

24:52.528 --> 24:55.446
He's a good bloke,
you know, as I was saying,

24:55.448 --> 24:56.688
and he's keen that...

24:58.408 --> 24:59.846
Go on.

24:59.848 --> 25:01.926
Well, he's keen that I see my wife.

25:01.928 --> 25:04.846
'I mean, I totally understand
if that's not possible.

25:04.848 --> 25:06.086
'Delicate...'

25:06.088 --> 25:09.486
business this,
you know. Is she there?

25:09.488 --> 25:11.648
I'm here! I'm right here, baby!

25:15.568 --> 25:18.606
It will have to be a hostage swap.
Make that

25:18.608 --> 25:20.406
'clear to Baxter.'

25:20.408 --> 25:22.446
We'll send the wee one.

25:22.448 --> 25:25.126
That's fine, yeah.
We'll swap Stella for Monica.

25:25.128 --> 25:28.848
'Can you send some beers over and
all, if it's not too much trouble?
Cheers.'

25:30.408 --> 25:33.206
You OK with this? You don't
have to, you know.

25:33.208 --> 25:34.326
He is armed.

25:34.328 --> 25:36.248
I'll do anything for my baby.

25:38.568 --> 25:43.248
If Katie Price here is your best
bet, those poor fuckers have had it.

25:56.768 --> 25:58.566
I've a very bad feeling about this.

25:58.568 --> 26:01.766
'I'll do anything for my baby!'

26:01.768 --> 26:04.206
This is how we negotiate.
Give and take.

26:04.208 --> 26:06.206
She's fully briefed.

26:06.208 --> 26:07.368
'It's all for my baby!'

26:38.248 --> 26:40.246
Is that my mum?

26:40.248 --> 26:41.288
Yeah.

26:43.568 --> 26:45.726
Come to Mummy, baby.

26:45.728 --> 26:47.246
Ohh!

26:47.248 --> 26:48.406
She's got Stella!

26:48.408 --> 26:49.448
Ohh!

26:51.288 --> 26:53.086
Told you so!

26:53.088 --> 26:54.486
What's she doing?

26:54.488 --> 26:55.526
Mothering, I think.

26:55.528 --> 26:56.966
My goodness! You're all right!

26:56.968 --> 26:58.086
Ohh!

26:58.088 --> 26:59.248
Tell her hurry up!

27:01.448 --> 27:02.886
Come on!

27:02.888 --> 27:04.206
Do the shot, Ma'am.

27:04.208 --> 27:05.286
Stella, not you!

27:05.288 --> 27:06.406
Take it.

27:06.408 --> 27:07.448
No, no!

27:09.928 --> 27:10.968
Jesus Christ!

27:13.568 --> 27:14.608
They've missed!

27:15.808 --> 27:18.008
But Stella's gone back inside!

27:19.928 --> 27:21.286
Frank!

27:21.288 --> 27:23.646
Shh! Shh!

27:23.648 --> 27:25.608
What the fuck was that?

27:27.128 --> 27:28.166
Frank...

27:28.168 --> 27:30.006
You see that? They're trying to
kill me. Jesus Christ!

27:30.008 --> 27:31.008
Monica....

27:33.768 --> 27:38.166
Well done, Ronnie. You've really
surpassed yourself this time.

27:38.168 --> 27:40.928
Clear the streets. I want those
fucking tramps out of there.

27:46.048 --> 27:47.446
Place looks good.

27:47.448 --> 27:49.126
Fuck's sake!

27:49.128 --> 27:51.606
You look... good.

27:51.608 --> 27:53.766
I hope you appreciate this.

27:53.768 --> 27:55.088
Thanks.

27:56.968 --> 27:58.048
I brought you these.

28:02.968 --> 28:05.566
Come away in. Away from the windows!

28:05.568 --> 28:06.846
Away from the windows!

28:06.848 --> 28:10.726
Frank! Please! Ladies first, eh?

28:10.728 --> 28:11.926
Right, come on, come on!

28:11.928 --> 28:14.446
Just keep away from the fucking
window. Go on, go on!

28:14.448 --> 28:17.486
Eh, eh, eh! Play your cards right,

28:17.488 --> 28:19.448
something good can come
out of all this.

28:23.288 --> 28:25.046
We can do the paperwork later.

28:25.048 --> 28:28.206
I want it noted, immediately,
that I raised concerns about

28:28.208 --> 28:31.886
Monica Gallagher's suitability for
a hostage swap and was overruled.

28:31.888 --> 28:34.326
Hardly overruled.

28:34.328 --> 28:37.726
The contretemps was entirely
the result of your shock...

28:37.728 --> 28:40.206
And awe approach.

28:40.208 --> 28:41.288
What happens now?

28:42.768 --> 28:47.086
We negotiate again.
Though since DCI Veronica B Johnson

28:47.088 --> 28:50.326
wholeheartedly destroyed our last
attempt, I'm not sure

28:50.328 --> 28:52.086
how successful we're going to be.

28:52.088 --> 28:54.126
I can't take it!

28:54.128 --> 28:56.128
Can you get her out of here, please,
Mrs Tutton?

28:57.168 --> 28:58.206
Mrs Tutton, please!

28:58.208 --> 29:00.726
OK, but we're witnesses to
the fact that yous don't

29:00.728 --> 29:02.246
know your arse from your elbow.

29:02.248 --> 29:04.008
Let's go and get a proper drink.

29:07.008 --> 29:08.328
Remember this one, love?

29:25.008 --> 29:26.686
You should tackle him.

29:26.688 --> 29:30.126
You fucking tackle him!
You're bigger than me.

29:30.128 --> 29:31.168
Got a fucking gun!

29:41.008 --> 29:42.166
I'm sorry to say this,

29:42.168 --> 29:45.606
but he's fallen into bad living
without you, Monica.

29:45.608 --> 29:47.246
I can see that.

29:47.248 --> 29:49.686
Taken up with my wife here.

29:49.688 --> 29:51.366
How could you do this to me?

29:51.368 --> 29:53.566
Err... this from the woman
who took three years

29:53.568 --> 29:56.046
to get a loaf of bread, twice!

29:56.048 --> 29:58.206
Sometimes things go wrong.

29:58.208 --> 30:01.566
But if it's meant to be, you'll
find a way back.

30:01.568 --> 30:02.608
It's fate.

30:04.168 --> 30:06.768
So what have you got to
say about her, eh, Frank?

30:08.568 --> 30:15.006
Derrilee is a prostitute,
a whore. My wife, the whore!

30:15.008 --> 30:17.126
She's not even embarrassed.

30:17.128 --> 30:18.926
I'm embarrassed of you.

30:18.928 --> 30:24.528
So, Baxter thought it'd be good for
me and you to get together, chat.

30:27.288 --> 30:30.928
So, what have you got to
say for yourself?

30:36.448 --> 30:38.486
I wasn't always the best husband.

30:38.488 --> 30:41.806
Ha! I had a terrible life with him.

30:41.808 --> 30:44.766
He never worked, he never lifted
a finger to help with the kids.

30:44.768 --> 30:47.286
He's working now, though,
earning a crust, aren't you?

30:47.288 --> 30:48.766
Yeah, it's not much though, Mon.

30:48.768 --> 30:52.846
You know, it's practically minimum
wage. Janitor in a school.

30:52.848 --> 30:54.606
Don't do yourself down.

30:54.608 --> 30:58.048
It's a good number, council pension,
sorted for the future.

30:59.768 --> 31:03.126
But there was
the emotional cruelty, too.

31:03.128 --> 31:05.528
A woman can't just forget that.

31:07.128 --> 31:08.688
The neglect.

31:11.288 --> 31:14.288
Go on, Frank. Tell her how you feel.

31:17.648 --> 31:22.288
I've come to realise I've made
mistakes but...

31:25.728 --> 31:27.088
..you're the one.

31:29.408 --> 31:30.408
My destiny.

31:35.928 --> 31:38.046
Jesus, Lillian, we'll do it later.

31:38.048 --> 31:39.406
He'll be here in a bit, though.

31:39.408 --> 31:40.446
Who?

31:40.448 --> 31:41.566
Richie.

31:41.568 --> 31:45.846
He's the best Cajun musician
in Manchester. He's my boyfriend!

31:45.848 --> 31:47.728
Look, they all like a bit of Cajun.

31:50.728 --> 31:52.486
What's animating that muppet?

31:52.488 --> 31:54.766
She's got a boyfriend.

31:54.768 --> 31:56.686
Lillian's lying too, then, Mimi?

31:56.688 --> 31:58.646
We've been through this.

31:58.648 --> 32:00.286
It turns out that there was a gunman

32:00.288 --> 32:04.486
but there was definitely no fire,
so Thalia is a liar.

32:04.488 --> 32:07.726
Even now, you can't just admit
you were wrong. Amazing!

32:07.728 --> 32:08.728
Ugh!

32:16.848 --> 32:19.648
Stella's in bed. She's asleep.

32:22.128 --> 32:23.168
This is nice.

32:24.368 --> 32:26.286
See, Derr?

32:26.288 --> 32:28.648
That's how it should be, a man
and his wife.

32:30.208 --> 32:32.128
Loving, tight.

32:42.928 --> 32:45.686
We'll get through this, Derr,
you and me.

32:45.688 --> 32:47.406
Just like them.

32:47.408 --> 32:48.568
We're not like them!

32:51.568 --> 32:55.486
No, you're right.
They've got seven kids.

32:55.488 --> 32:57.846
Seven kids to show for their love.

32:57.848 --> 32:59.846
Maybe if you could have borne me
some weans,

32:59.848 --> 33:01.406
we would have been like that.

33:01.408 --> 33:05.446
Barren, though, this one, Frank.
My mammy was so disappointed.

33:05.448 --> 33:09.366
I'm not barren.
Very fertile, actually.

33:09.368 --> 33:10.766
You're very fertile, too.

33:10.768 --> 33:11.846
Derr...

33:11.848 --> 33:13.686
It's fine. It's a night of truths.

33:13.688 --> 33:15.686
Let's get it all out.

33:15.688 --> 33:18.286
You knocked me up
no less than seven times.

33:18.288 --> 33:21.926
And seven times I thought about that
little baby in my belly,

33:21.928 --> 33:23.126
your little baby.

33:23.128 --> 33:24.328
Stop. Just stop.

33:26.328 --> 33:29.046
I went to the clinic and I said...

33:29.048 --> 33:31.048
"Get this thing out of me!"

33:36.194 --> 33:37.334
What you doing?

33:37.390 --> 33:38.490
Checking she's OK.

33:38.529 --> 33:40.487
Don't think he'd like you
fiddling with her.

33:40.489 --> 33:43.207
I'm not fiddling with her.
I'm checking she's not fucking dead!

33:43.209 --> 33:45.727
Be karma if she was, really,
after all them abortions.

33:45.729 --> 33:47.527
Be better
if you weren't yapping in me ear.

33:47.529 --> 33:50.087
I'm only trying to help,
Dr Gallagher!

33:50.089 --> 33:53.047
It's a shame he didn't
fucking knock you out instead.

33:53.049 --> 33:54.087
Frank...

33:54.089 --> 33:55.129
Hey!

34:02.009 --> 34:04.287
There hasn't been
a squeak for ten minutes.

34:04.289 --> 34:09.127
Patience, mon amie. He's probably
weighing up his options.

34:09.129 --> 34:11.047
Deciding which one to shoot first.

34:11.049 --> 34:13.927
And thanks to you, he's got
an even bigger selection.

34:13.929 --> 34:15.647
You may not agree with my methods,

34:15.649 --> 34:19.369
but storming in there has already
derailed this operation.

34:21.849 --> 34:25.047
Just because you fucked up
the hostage swap.

34:25.049 --> 34:27.007
Must have known he'd react badly.

34:27.009 --> 34:28.806
Any father would.

34:28.809 --> 34:30.927
Do you know what it took for me
to get away?

34:30.929 --> 34:32.849
No-one's saying you've got to
go back to him.

34:32.946 --> 34:33.984
Not permanently.

34:33.985 --> 34:37.143
But there are ways of dealing
with this kind of situation.

34:37.146 --> 34:38.746
I will not go crawling back.

34:40.306 --> 34:41.344
Look, love.

34:41.346 --> 34:45.824
You may not be as pro-life as I am,
but I have had seven kids

34:45.826 --> 34:47.904
and I want to get out to see them.

34:47.906 --> 34:50.824
Can't you just indulge his little
fantasy long enough to get him shot

34:50.826 --> 34:52.346
and us to get out alive?

34:55.106 --> 34:56.706
Oh, Jesus!

34:58.826 --> 35:00.426
I'm not sure I can do this.

35:01.986 --> 35:05.666
Look, I know it's hard,
but I can't see another way.

35:29.586 --> 35:32.746
The idea of my baby so repulsive?

35:34.226 --> 35:37.426
I lied. There were no abortions.

35:41.186 --> 35:43.824
I wish you loved me like I love you.
Cruel thing...

35:43.826 --> 35:44.866
I do love you.

35:46.986 --> 35:48.026
Fuck it!

35:51.506 --> 35:54.024
She can't be much fun to be around.

35:54.026 --> 35:56.786
Always feeling sorry for herself.

35:58.346 --> 36:01.944
Her fucked-up psycho husband
is now seven abortions nearer

36:01.946 --> 36:05.024
blowing all our heads off.
How exactly should she be acting?

36:05.026 --> 36:07.226
All right,
no need to be snappy with me!

36:10.826 --> 36:15.504
Look, try and relax. I've been doing
this Tantric meditation.

36:15.506 --> 36:16.544
It really helps.

36:16.546 --> 36:18.344
Sorry, I'm a bit low on joss sticks.

36:18.346 --> 36:20.424
Let me just rub your aura.

36:20.426 --> 36:21.866
Oh, Je... Just get off!

36:24.386 --> 36:27.024
Just trying to keep morale up.

36:27.026 --> 36:29.504
If I was him, I'd definitely
shoot that Monica one.

36:29.506 --> 36:31.426
I'd give him self-defence.

36:39.826 --> 36:41.904
It's been a bad day for all of us.

36:41.906 --> 36:43.944
That what passes as an apology
round here?

36:43.946 --> 36:45.824
Could put a word in
for you at the school,

36:45.826 --> 36:49.184
set up a meeting with
the catering manager.

36:49.186 --> 36:52.864
I don't want anything to do
with your fucked-up, exploitative,

36:52.866 --> 36:56.744
supplying God knows how many
black markets school. OK?

36:56.746 --> 36:59.944
You should be ashamed, making money
out of a captive audience.

36:59.946 --> 37:02.226
Not here, love.
The captives are over the road.

37:03.146 --> 37:04.986
When you left...

37:07.626 --> 37:10.024
..I took the pills
out of the bathroom.

37:10.026 --> 37:12.986
I sat and I counted out one for each
year we've been together.

37:14.266 --> 37:15.544
Just want to end it.

37:15.546 --> 37:17.544
What stopped you?

37:17.546 --> 37:18.824
So you're working now?

37:18.826 --> 37:21.464
Yeah, living
the public sector dream.

37:21.466 --> 37:23.226
You've done well for yourself.

37:28.426 --> 37:29.824
Oh, God!

37:29.826 --> 37:34.424
I'm sorry, Frank. I think
it must be delayed shock. I'm sorry.

37:34.426 --> 37:37.224
Well, I reckon we're all in
for a bout of that.

37:37.226 --> 37:42.866
I mean, supposing you're right?
Supposing this is the end?

37:46.066 --> 37:51.226
Hold me, Frank. Let me
feel love again before I die.

37:59.466 --> 38:01.344
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

38:01.346 --> 38:03.424
Don't be daft.
Look how popular it is.

38:03.426 --> 38:06.384
Lillian, there's a madman on the
estate. Everyone's been evacuated.

38:06.386 --> 38:09.266
Right, folks. We're playing this
for the people of the Chatsworth.

38:15.346 --> 38:19.304
It was me.
Anyone got a fucking problem?

38:19.306 --> 38:20.346
All right.

38:41.426 --> 38:44.304
# I could feel... #

38:44.306 --> 38:47.104
He's singing to her.

38:47.106 --> 38:49.424
Oh, Jesus, he's building to the end!

38:49.426 --> 38:50.866
You never sing to me.

38:52.066 --> 38:55.744
Have I inadvertently locked myself
in an asylum?

38:55.746 --> 38:57.424
I think it's romantic.

38:57.426 --> 38:58.784
Jesus!

38:58.786 --> 39:00.784
Look, I've come all this way
to support you

39:00.786 --> 39:04.184
and you haven't said one nice thing
to me all night.

39:04.186 --> 39:06.304
Well, I'm sorry if
I'm a bit distracted!

39:06.306 --> 39:08.784
Might be to do with the gunman
sitting in there,

39:08.786 --> 39:11.226
singing his final fucking serenade.

39:13.546 --> 39:15.784
What you just did,
it meant a lot to Thalia.

39:15.786 --> 39:18.544
Flatulence, least of my worries
today,

39:18.546 --> 39:21.586
not to mention Lillian organising
a fucking hoedown.

39:22.746 --> 39:26.146
People seem to be enjoying
the distraction.

39:30.746 --> 39:33.426
Try and make contact again,
then we're going in.

39:43.746 --> 39:45.344
We don't have much time.

39:45.346 --> 39:47.944
Give yourself up.
They won't hurt you.

39:47.946 --> 39:50.384
They're going to put me away
for a long time, sweetheart.

39:50.386 --> 39:52.424
I'll wait for you.

39:52.426 --> 39:54.066
I won't let them
take you away from me.

39:58.426 --> 40:00.304
Me and Derr need a bit of time alone.

40:00.306 --> 40:03.184
Say no more.
We'll be on our way, then.

40:03.186 --> 40:04.346
Upstairs.

40:07.226 --> 40:09.784
I'm not sure this is a good idea.

40:09.786 --> 40:10.986
Nobody asked you, pal.

40:29.906 --> 40:31.426
This isn't right.

40:34.306 --> 40:37.106
Well,
we just have to make the best of it.

40:38.426 --> 40:43.184
I meant Derr, downstairs,
about to be raped at gunpoint.

40:43.186 --> 40:46.504
She's a prostitute
and she's married to him.

40:46.506 --> 40:49.706
Just let him get his end away
and then we can all get out of here.

41:15.346 --> 41:16.704
Take first positions.

41:16.706 --> 41:17.706
Move!

41:24.346 --> 41:26.546
It's on! They're moving in!

41:28.266 --> 41:32.184
Try not to worry about it. Hmm?

41:32.186 --> 41:34.226
He hasn't actually shot anyone yet.

41:35.466 --> 41:38.104
The postman. Little Albert!

41:38.106 --> 41:40.106
Oh, yeah. Forgot about him.

41:42.266 --> 41:47.624
I read somewhere that fear
can turn some people on.

41:47.626 --> 41:54.706
I don't know about you,
but I am very, very afraid.

41:56.226 --> 42:02.186
Well, life or death situation.
It's bound to have an affect.

42:05.546 --> 42:07.106
Ahh!

42:11.346 --> 42:12.586
What's going on?

42:14.346 --> 42:15.544
Ahh!

42:15.546 --> 42:16.624
Ooh!

42:16.626 --> 42:17.706
Ah!

42:21.706 --> 42:23.346
Fuck!

42:24.706 --> 42:25.986
Go, go, go!

43:32.626 --> 43:35.344
Kill you to tidy up once in a while?

43:35.346 --> 43:38.626
I'm suffering from post-traumatic
distress disorder.

43:46.186 --> 43:47.906
You said you'd make us a brew.

43:53.626 --> 43:55.466
Hey, you're back!

43:56.906 --> 43:58.384
Come to say goodbye.

43:58.386 --> 43:59.984
They let you off, then?

43:59.986 --> 44:01.624
Self-defence.

44:01.626 --> 44:05.104
So you say. Frank, I need a hand.

44:05.106 --> 44:07.066
Yeah, just give us a minute.

44:11.106 --> 44:13.264
She's not a permanent fixture.

44:13.266 --> 44:16.104
Stay and we can
have things as they were.

44:16.106 --> 44:18.104
Just wanted to give this to Stella.

44:18.106 --> 44:21.904
I won't be here for your birthday
but you can't open it till then.

44:21.906 --> 44:23.546
I promise.

44:26.346 --> 44:27.824
Where will you go?

44:27.826 --> 44:29.626
It's best you don't know.

44:32.266 --> 44:33.466
Going to miss you.

44:38.546 --> 44:40.106
Goodbye, Frank.

44:42.106 --> 44:44.106
Frank!

44:46.106 --> 44:51.026
'The more I think about it, the more
I think Gloria got it right, 1978.'

44:53.626 --> 44:55.146
'I will survive.'

45:02.386 --> 45:03.984
'Because this is me,

45:03.986 --> 45:08.266
'somebody new with a lot of love
still left to give.'

45:12.026 --> 45:15.666
'We all end up with the love
we deserve.'

45:24.186 --> 45:28.746
'Just might take some of us
that bit longer to find it.'

45:40.626 --> 45:41.744
Frank!

45:41.746 --> 45:43.664
Sparkling wine and some beer.

45:43.666 --> 45:45.464
No welcome back, how've you been?

45:45.466 --> 45:46.584
Why, did you go somewhere?

45:46.586 --> 45:48.464
Frank...

45:48.466 --> 45:51.544
Fuck's sake, Frank!
She's having a baby, you idiot!

45:51.546 --> 45:53.104
I'm not the social.

45:53.106 --> 45:54.584
I'm Fiona.

45:54.586 --> 45:56.224
The Brothers Grimm.

45:56.226 --> 45:57.624
Did your mother call you?

45:57.626 --> 45:59.184
Just tell us who's dead, Dad!

45:59.186 --> 46:00.904
I don't know how to stop him crying.

46:00.906 --> 46:03.464
I'm not going to let this happen
again. I'm taking the kids.

46:03.466 --> 46:04.664
What if it were your kid, Lip?

46:04.666 --> 46:07.544
- Hiya, Kev. How are you, Kev?
- I just need your help!

46:07.546 --> 46:09.186
This is our chance!
