WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.769
Previously, on The Practice...

00:02.803 --> 00:05.606
She's taken me
to court.

00:05.639 --> 00:07.073
She wants a divorce?

00:07.107 --> 00:08.675
No, no, she's
too smart for that.

00:08.709 --> 00:10.544
No, she wants to be
named my conservator.

00:10.577 --> 00:12.278
Joanne, I just thought --

00:12.312 --> 00:14.447
You looked me in the eye
two years ago and told me

00:14.480 --> 00:15.516
to step in.

00:15.549 --> 00:17.751
That was about getting him
to stop practicing law.

00:17.784 --> 00:19.152
This is about competency.

00:19.185 --> 00:20.721
I can't control him
anymore.

00:20.754 --> 00:21.722
Control me?!

00:21.755 --> 00:22.756
I don't need you

00:22.789 --> 00:25.158
to control me.

00:25.191 --> 00:26.159
Where's Ray?

00:26.192 --> 00:27.427
Is he all right?

00:27.460 --> 00:29.162
Right here, Bobby...

00:30.263 --> 00:31.765
Ray, what happened?

00:31.798 --> 00:33.233
She tried to kill me.

00:33.266 --> 00:35.502
Do you realize
what you've done?

00:35.536 --> 00:36.737
How about
an N.G.I. plea?

00:36.770 --> 00:37.704
Insanity?

00:37.738 --> 00:39.606
Get the right shrink,
get the psych exam.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.241
I'll back you.

00:41.274 --> 00:44.377
Listen, the only way that
I can represent you here

00:44.410 --> 00:45.812
is to plead insanity.

00:45.846 --> 00:47.113
It's not going to happen.

00:47.147 --> 00:48.582
-You confessed.
-No!

00:48.615 --> 00:51.618
No, I said,
"self-defense."

00:51.652 --> 00:54.621
Commonwealth vs. Raymond Oz,
murder in the first degree.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.690
The defendant enters
a plea of "not guilty."

00:56.723 --> 00:58.792
Your honor, I'd like
to represent myself.

00:58.825 --> 01:01.294
I will allow
you to represent yourself,

01:01.327 --> 01:04.430
but I'm ordering Mr. Donnell
to stay on as co-counsel.

01:04.464 --> 01:05.364
I don't need him.

01:05.397 --> 01:08.334
Well, then, you'll just
have to humor me.

01:11.271 --> 01:13.306
REPORTER: Mr. Bay,
what does it feel like

01:13.339 --> 01:16.476
to be prosecuting
the legendary Raymond Oz?

01:19.846 --> 01:21.314
REPORTER: Counsel,
what is your strategy?

01:21.347 --> 01:22.783
No questions,
no comments.

01:24.818 --> 01:27.087
(questioning continues)

01:28.622 --> 01:31.491
One of the reasons
I went to law school

01:31.525 --> 01:34.160
was Raymond Oz.

01:34.194 --> 01:38.198
Sitting over there
in that chair is...

01:38.231 --> 01:40.466
A legend.

01:40.501 --> 01:43.269
When I decided I wanted
to be a lawyer,

01:43.303 --> 01:46.873
I, like so many others
who have walked into this room,

01:46.907 --> 01:50.210
really wanted to be him.

01:50.243 --> 01:53.814
I sat back
in that gallery

01:53.847 --> 01:56.182
and watched him
charm hostile witnesses,

01:56.216 --> 01:59.285
befuddle the smartest
of judges,

01:59.319 --> 02:01.354
mesmerize juries.

02:01.387 --> 02:04.157
He quite likely will
charm and mesmerize

02:04.190 --> 02:06.159
the twelve of you.

02:06.192 --> 02:09.294
But we are not
here today in tribute

02:09.329 --> 02:13.166
of Raymond Oz. We are here
because he committed a murder.

02:13.199 --> 02:18.839
The evidence will show that
he picked up a bronze trophy,

02:18.872 --> 02:20.774
that had once been
presented to him

02:20.807 --> 02:23.309
for one of his many
accomplishments,

02:23.343 --> 02:27.548
and he struck his wife
Joanne, killing her.

02:27.581 --> 02:30.250
I wish it weren't so.

02:30.283 --> 02:34.888
You have no idea how much
I wish it weren't so.

02:37.257 --> 02:39.292
But it is.

02:50.604 --> 02:53.607
(murmuring in court)

03:00.747 --> 03:03.216
"Wishes he were me,"

03:03.249 --> 03:06.252
he says.

03:06.286 --> 03:08.421
Look behind my table,
ladies and gentlemen.

03:10.423 --> 03:11.825
You won't see any sons,

03:11.858 --> 03:14.460
or daughters,
grandchildren,

03:14.494 --> 03:16.396
we never had them,
my wife and I.

03:16.429 --> 03:18.832
All we had
was each other.

03:18.865 --> 03:23.469
And yet our lives
never felt empty.

03:23.504 --> 03:27.874
Ours was
a great love affair.

03:27.908 --> 03:30.343
I killed her.

03:31.878 --> 03:32.979
The only woman
I ever loved,

03:33.013 --> 03:34.247
I killed her.

03:35.916 --> 03:37.984
But it was
in self-defense.

03:38.018 --> 03:39.853
Now, Mr. Bay
wasn't there.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.555
The police detectives
weren't there.

03:41.588 --> 03:43.857
I was there.

03:43.890 --> 03:46.593
A great love affair.

03:46.627 --> 03:49.395
And I don't know what
will haunt me more...

03:50.731 --> 03:53.834
That, in the end,
I took her life,

03:53.867 --> 03:57.738
or that, in the end...

03:57.771 --> 04:00.306
She tried to take mine.

04:14.054 --> 04:17.257
â™ª

05:02.836 --> 05:04.437
When we arrived,
we discovered

05:04.470 --> 05:06.707
the victim on the floor,
bleeding from a head wound.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.575
Did you see
anybody else?

05:08.609 --> 05:11.411
The defendant. He was sitting
at the kitchen table,

05:11.444 --> 05:12.646
he appeared to be crying.

05:12.679 --> 05:13.714
Did he say anything?

05:13.747 --> 05:15.649
He said that
he had to do it.

05:15.682 --> 05:18.118
He just kept saying
he had to do it.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.853
Did you ask him
what he meant by that?

05:19.886 --> 05:21.722
Yes, and he replied,

05:21.755 --> 05:25.091
"She had to be stopped."

05:25.125 --> 05:26.893
Thank you, detective.

05:26.927 --> 05:29.029
Didn't I tell you

05:29.062 --> 05:31.097
that she tried to kill me?

05:31.131 --> 05:33.634
And that I acted
in self-defense?

05:33.667 --> 05:36.870
Didn't I say
those words to you?

05:36.903 --> 05:38.739
That came much later.

05:38.772 --> 05:42.709
Please read
Ms. Gamble's question.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.680
"Did he say anything?"

05:46.713 --> 05:47.848
That's the question.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.683
Anything, not "right away."

05:49.716 --> 05:53.520
Why didn't you tell the jury
everything I said, detective?

05:53.554 --> 05:55.989
I thought the question referred
to when I first arrived.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.090
RAY: Is that really so?

05:57.123 --> 05:59.860
Or did you think that
if you told the whole truth,

05:59.893 --> 06:01.595
it wouldn't help secure
the conviction

06:01.628 --> 06:04.464
that you're up here to get as a
witnesses for the prosecution?

06:04.497 --> 06:05.999
-Objection.
-Sustained.

06:06.032 --> 06:08.134
Did you find the knife
at the scene, detective?

06:08.168 --> 06:11.738
Yes. We found a nine-inch
serrated carving knife,

06:11.772 --> 06:12.739
on the floor.

06:12.773 --> 06:13.874
Run fingerprints?

06:13.907 --> 06:15.441
The fingerprints
belonged to the victim.

06:15.475 --> 06:19.513
Something else you didn't
tell the jury in your direct
testimony, isn't it?

06:19.546 --> 06:22.048
She didn't ask me
about the knife.

06:22.082 --> 06:25.652
She didn't ask you
about the knife.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.028
Bobby.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.196
How'd it go?

06:36.229 --> 06:37.998
So far, so good.

06:38.031 --> 06:41.868
I got to hand it to him.
You comin' down to watch?

06:41.902 --> 06:44.605
No, I'm having a quick lunch
with Roberta.

06:45.639 --> 06:46.840
Judge Kittleson?

06:46.873 --> 06:48.041
Yeah.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.043
A-are you two back
together again?

06:50.076 --> 06:52.445
Oh, I don't know,
we're talking about it.

06:52.478 --> 06:53.780
Jimmy, she's the judge
on this case.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.048
That's
a potential conflict.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.216
Are you kidding?!

06:56.249 --> 06:57.984
Her and her "integrity
of the robe" crap.

06:58.018 --> 06:59.786
Even the perception
of bias --

06:59.820 --> 07:01.888
it's my business,
not yours.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.528
If he stays that good,
we're in trouble.

07:07.561 --> 07:10.130
He won't. There's no way
he'll make it through the trial

07:10.163 --> 07:12.966
without flashing his rage.

07:12.999 --> 07:14.901
He has to take the stand.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.170
I'll keep him up there weeks,
if I have to.

07:17.203 --> 07:19.205
He may not have to
take the stand, Helen,

07:19.239 --> 07:20.774
not if we don't
make the elements.

07:20.807 --> 07:23.209
We're making the elements.

07:25.912 --> 07:27.781
What?

07:27.814 --> 07:28.882
That look you get
in your eye.

07:28.915 --> 07:30.751
That "trial look."

07:30.784 --> 07:33.954
You are a killer, you know that?
An icy killer.

07:33.987 --> 07:34.988
Thank you, Richard.

07:35.021 --> 07:36.690
It's a compliment,
I take it?

07:36.723 --> 07:40.026
Of course it was.
Your style's the same as mine.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.227
I'm in love with you.

07:41.261 --> 07:42.663
(spits)

07:42.696 --> 07:43.997
I'm sorry, I should
say, "infatuated."

07:44.030 --> 07:46.232
I mean, you're smart,
you're sexy,

07:46.266 --> 07:48.535
you got that little
catholic girl thing,

07:48.569 --> 07:50.103
and in the courtroom
you are vicious.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.839
And I totally go for
the whole package!

07:52.873 --> 07:55.876
Richard, we're in the middle
of a trial here.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.177
I speak my mind.

07:57.210 --> 07:59.045
Yes, well,
I'm speaking mine...

07:59.079 --> 08:00.747
Let's stick to business.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.850
The point of impact
was right here.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.652
At the base of the skull.

08:05.686 --> 08:08.254
Were you able to make
a determination, doctor,

08:08.288 --> 08:10.691
as to which direction
the blow came from?

08:10.724 --> 08:12.959
I think it's quite obvious
it came from behind.

08:12.993 --> 08:16.797
Now, doctor, if Mr. Oz
had swung from the side

08:16.830 --> 08:18.231
and the victim
turned her head,

08:18.264 --> 08:20.901
is there any chance it could
have struck her like this

08:20.934 --> 08:21.935
in the rear?

08:21.968 --> 08:23.737
No. She had to be
facing the other direction.

08:23.770 --> 08:25.672
The blow came from
directly behind her.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.774
You can state this
for a medical certainty?

08:27.808 --> 08:29.109
Absolutely.

08:31.978 --> 08:32.979
JUDGE:
Mr. Oz?

08:34.715 --> 08:37.618
I'm delighted to know
that there's such a thing

08:37.650 --> 08:39.620
as "a medical certainty."

08:39.653 --> 08:41.287
Last one I knew of was...

08:41.321 --> 08:45.025
When my brother-in-law was told
he had six months to live.

08:45.058 --> 08:46.760
That was a medical certainty.

08:46.793 --> 08:48.028
That was twelve years ago.

08:48.061 --> 08:50.296
He still beats me
at tennis.

08:50.330 --> 08:51.665
(people laugh)

08:51.698 --> 08:52.933
Doctor.

08:52.966 --> 08:55.201
I'm gonna propose
a hypothetical to you,

08:55.235 --> 08:58.271
and I want you to tell me
if it's possible.

08:58.304 --> 09:02.776
A woman comes at a man
with a knife.

09:02.809 --> 09:04.945
She swings wildly
and misses,

09:04.978 --> 09:07.247
then she comes at him
again, at which point

09:07.280 --> 09:09.182
he picks up
a heavy bronze trophy,

09:09.215 --> 09:10.183
in defense.

09:10.216 --> 09:12.185
She comes at him again,

09:12.218 --> 09:14.320
he rears back to swing,

09:14.354 --> 09:16.356
and as the trophy
comes down,

09:16.389 --> 09:17.958
she turns to run away.

09:17.991 --> 09:20.794
And she turns 180 degrees,
but it's too late,

09:20.827 --> 09:23.830
because the trophy strikes her
on the back of her head.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.932
Now, I don't want you
to answer in probabilities

09:25.966 --> 09:28.268
or likelihoods, doctor.

09:28.301 --> 09:29.369
The question is,

09:29.402 --> 09:31.204
is it possible?

09:31.237 --> 09:33.273
Yes or no?

09:37.410 --> 09:39.179
I suppose
it is possible.

09:39.212 --> 09:41.247
Thank you, doctor.
You have just answered

09:41.281 --> 09:44.585
one of the most important
questions before this court.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.858
JUDGE:
Mr. Oz?

09:57.430 --> 09:59.866
Who in the hell
are you?

10:10.243 --> 10:13.847
In many ways,
he's closer to me
than my own father.

10:14.848 --> 10:17.217
The idea of him
being a spectacle...

10:17.250 --> 10:19.686
Bobby, have you been
paying attention in there?

10:19.720 --> 10:20.721
He's winning.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.756
So far, maybe.

10:24.991 --> 10:26.292
You all set?

10:26.326 --> 10:28.261
Yes, let's go.

10:31.297 --> 10:32.633
Trevor!

10:33.433 --> 10:35.068
Raymond.

10:35.101 --> 10:37.938
Well, ha ha...

10:37.971 --> 10:40.340
I'm-I'm so sorry.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.243
You've heard me speak
of Bobby Donnell.

10:43.276 --> 10:46.312
Bobby, this is Trevor Wain,
one of my oldest
and dearest friends.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.048
That's great of you to come.
What a surprise.

10:48.081 --> 10:51.451
But the room's full.
They're turning people away.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.454
Can we get him in, Bobby?

10:54.487 --> 10:58.424
Ray, he's-he's testifying
for the prosecution.

10:58.458 --> 10:59.893
What?

10:59.926 --> 11:01.327
He's on their witness list.

11:01.361 --> 11:04.965
Oh, oh, oh, yes,
of course.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.432
Of course.
(awkward laughter)

11:06.466 --> 11:08.869
Mr. Wain,
we have to get in.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.304
I'm sorry, Ray.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.246
We should be
getting in, too.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.115
Come on, Ray.

11:24.150 --> 11:25.451
Yeah. Ah.

11:26.953 --> 11:28.354
Yeah.

11:28.388 --> 11:29.790
Let's go.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.358
You two are friends?

11:32.392 --> 11:33.994
Over fifty years.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.229
We stood up for each other
at our weddings.

11:36.262 --> 11:38.865
And yet you're here
testifying against him today?

11:38.899 --> 11:39.966
You subpoenaed me.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.503
Mr. Wain,
the defendant spoke

11:42.536 --> 11:45.338
of a great love affair
between him and the victim.

11:45.371 --> 11:48.341
Did you have the opportunity
to witness their relationship?

11:48.374 --> 11:49.342
Yes.

11:49.375 --> 11:50.977
Could you describe it?

11:51.011 --> 11:53.113
It was very loving.
Until...

11:53.146 --> 11:55.048
The last two years
or so.

11:55.081 --> 11:56.850
What happened?

11:56.883 --> 11:59.285
Ray had a stroke.

11:59.319 --> 12:03.423
After which he, uh,
suffered memory lapses.

12:03.456 --> 12:06.092
Even had some occasional
delusions and paranoia.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.493
That's a lie!

12:07.528 --> 12:09.095
JUDGE: Mr. Oz,
you will remain quiet

12:09.129 --> 12:12.866
until it's your turn
to cross-examine.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.034
Trevor: at some point,
it...

12:14.067 --> 12:16.102
Was difficult

12:16.136 --> 12:18.071
for him to try cases
anymore.

12:18.104 --> 12:22.843
So Joanne, evidently,
told the judge that...

12:22.876 --> 12:25.145
It was time
for him to step down.

12:25.178 --> 12:26.880
He never forgave her
for that.

12:26.913 --> 12:29.082
He told me,
he hated her for it.

12:29.115 --> 12:31.251
He used the word,
"hate"?

12:31.284 --> 12:32.385
Yes.

12:32.418 --> 12:35.021
What else?

12:35.055 --> 12:36.557
Well, just recently,

12:36.590 --> 12:39.425
she went to court trying
to have him declared...

12:39.459 --> 12:40.426
Incompetent.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.328
That enraged him.

12:42.362 --> 12:43.864
Objection.
Foundation.

12:43.897 --> 12:45.065
Objection's overruled.

12:45.098 --> 12:50.136
Sir, do you have an opinion
as to why it so enraged him?

12:52.873 --> 12:54.140
Well, with Ray,

12:54.174 --> 12:57.911
I mean everything's about
walking into a room.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.546
When he made his entrance,

12:59.580 --> 13:02.082
he needed for people
to think,

13:02.115 --> 13:04.885
"ah, there's Raymond Oz!"

13:04.918 --> 13:06.386
He always, always...

13:06.419 --> 13:08.555
Talked about
his legacy.

13:08.589 --> 13:11.925
I think it was more important
to him than anything...

13:11.958 --> 13:13.894
Or anybody.

13:13.927 --> 13:18.198
And the idea of being
declared incompetent...

13:18.231 --> 13:22.168
Well, you see, that was
more than he could handle.

13:22.202 --> 13:24.437
"more than he could handle"?

13:24.470 --> 13:27.340
Do you think it could
make him homicidal?

13:29.976 --> 13:31.845
I don't know.

13:32.378 --> 13:34.147
Thank you, Mr. Wain.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.256
Mr. Oz?

13:47.393 --> 13:49.295
It was fantastic!

13:49.329 --> 13:51.064
The best thing was how
it looked painful

13:51.097 --> 13:52.332
for him
to bury his friend.

13:52.365 --> 13:54.234
Ho ho. Oz couldn't
get up and do

13:54.267 --> 13:56.570
the prosecutorial
witness number on him,
could he?

13:56.603 --> 13:59.472
And Helen,
you were brilliant!

13:59.506 --> 14:02.943
You were quiet, you let
the damaging words hang,

14:02.976 --> 14:05.145
beautifully. You didn't
look aggressive.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.947
Ha! Fabulous.
The witness

14:06.980 --> 14:08.949
and the D. A.
looked sympathetic.

14:08.982 --> 14:10.383
It was music!

14:10.416 --> 14:11.184
Richard.

14:11.217 --> 14:13.153
Let's not lose sight
of the fact

14:13.186 --> 14:15.488
that this whole thing
is a pretty big tragedy.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.290
A woman is dead.

14:18.959 --> 14:21.394
And a great man
is destroyed.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.497
Shouldn't enjoy it
too much.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.099
I know,
I-I don't mean to.

14:26.132 --> 14:27.634
I really don't,
but Helen,

14:27.668 --> 14:29.235
we're back on top.

14:29.269 --> 14:31.972
They have to jump
at manslaughter now.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.239
I hope they still offer it.

14:33.273 --> 14:34.508
You didn't
cross the guy at all?

14:34.541 --> 14:36.176
Nothing really
to cross him on, Eugene.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.344
The testimony seemed
to pain him the most.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.246
He certainly didn't
seem biased.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.648
The worst thing is,

14:41.682 --> 14:43.083
I believed him.

14:43.116 --> 14:44.184
So did I.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.686
Then you have to
take manslaughter.

14:45.719 --> 14:48.922
Any chance we can switch
the pleas to insanity?

14:48.955 --> 14:50.456
This late, without notice,
forget it.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.225
Plus Ray would never
go for it.

14:52.258 --> 14:53.560
He might now.

14:53.594 --> 14:56.162
Even he had to see
how damaging that was.

14:56.196 --> 14:58.398
His life-long friend
just gave them motive.

14:58.431 --> 14:59.365
Gift-wrapped.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.367
Any feel for whether
Kittleson would let us

15:01.401 --> 15:03.236
switch pleas this deep?

15:03.269 --> 15:05.606
Bobby, we haven't said
a word about the case.
You kidding?

15:05.639 --> 15:07.941
You better see if ray
will switch his plea.

15:10.410 --> 15:11.477
No insanity!

15:11.512 --> 15:14.380
And I don't want you
to mention it ever again, Bobby.

15:14.414 --> 15:15.949
Do you hear me?

15:15.982 --> 15:17.618
You know that we were hurt
by your friend Trevor.

15:17.651 --> 15:19.085
I was there!

15:19.119 --> 15:21.321
I know what he said.

15:21.354 --> 15:22.388
Raymond,

15:22.422 --> 15:24.390
Raymond,
look at me.

15:26.026 --> 15:29.630
The jury has all it needs
to convict you now.

15:29.663 --> 15:32.032
If we can just
switch pleas --

15:32.065 --> 15:33.099
No.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.601
You have to consider this.

15:34.635 --> 15:35.602
I will not!

15:35.636 --> 15:37.971
Have my final legacy,

15:38.004 --> 15:39.640
a doddering--

15:39.673 --> 15:41.708
Oh, enough about
your damn legacy!

15:43.209 --> 15:45.345
Legacy is family.

15:45.378 --> 15:48.348
It's friends.

15:48.381 --> 15:51.384
You killed you wife,
and your best friend
just turned on you,

15:51.417 --> 15:52.519
that's your legacy, Ray!

15:52.553 --> 15:54.387
You turned on me, Bobby!
didn't ya?

15:54.420 --> 15:56.523
You're the one that
went to that judge, aren't ya?

15:56.557 --> 15:57.658
Yes, and you're the one

15:57.691 --> 15:59.726
that wanted to end
my legal career!

15:59.760 --> 16:02.028
You're the one
that convinced Joanne

16:02.062 --> 16:05.398
to go along with you.

16:05.431 --> 16:07.267
And I hated you for that,
Bobby.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.536
Oh, so you
hate me now, too, Ray?

16:09.570 --> 16:12.138
Yes. I hate you, Bobby.

16:12.172 --> 16:14.775
I won't shy away
from saying that.

16:14.808 --> 16:15.776
I hate ya!

16:15.809 --> 16:17.644
Well, you know what?

16:17.678 --> 16:20.547
I'm beginning to
hate you right back.

16:20.581 --> 16:22.282
Because you're so pathetic.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.450
You watch your mouth!

16:24.484 --> 16:27.153
You're wife is dead, and you
haven't even been to her grave.

16:27.187 --> 16:30.156
All you care about is
your reputation as a lawyer,

16:30.190 --> 16:31.457
the great Oz!

16:31.491 --> 16:34.094
Well, you may not have
loved Joanne, I did!

16:34.127 --> 16:36.296
Like I once loved you.

16:36.329 --> 16:40.100
And now, I-I don't think
you were insane.

16:40.133 --> 16:42.235
I think
it was premeditated.

16:42.268 --> 16:44.638
You weren't about to let her
declare you incompetent

16:44.671 --> 16:46.072
and tarnish your legacy.

16:46.106 --> 16:47.641
So you killed her!

16:47.674 --> 16:50.043
And that's what you'll
leave behind with me, Ray.

16:50.076 --> 16:53.046
I'll remember you as
a premeditated murderer!

16:53.079 --> 16:54.114
Bobby!

16:54.147 --> 16:55.181
Get out.

16:55.215 --> 16:57.317
How dare you accuse me

16:57.350 --> 16:59.185
of not loving her!

16:59.219 --> 17:00.721
You killed her!

17:00.754 --> 17:04.290
And now you're telling the world
that she tried to kill you?!

17:04.324 --> 17:07.093
What about her legacy, Ray?

17:07.127 --> 17:10.296
This woman devoted
her entire life to you.

17:10.329 --> 17:12.633
What about
the memory of her?

17:12.665 --> 17:14.467
She deserved better
than that!

17:14.500 --> 17:17.570
Your precious legacy.

17:17.604 --> 17:21.107
You will die
an unloved murderer!

17:22.108 --> 17:25.377
You-you pitiful old man.

17:48.769 --> 17:50.203
Hey.

17:50.236 --> 17:51.605
Let's go to bed.

17:53.707 --> 17:57.210
I told him he'd die
an unloved murderer.

18:01.447 --> 18:03.850
He did everything
for me.

18:08.254 --> 18:10.591
He may die a murderer,

18:10.624 --> 18:14.394
but he's obviously
not unloved.

18:17.564 --> 18:18.799
Come on.

18:18.832 --> 18:20.801
Let's get some sleep.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.236
(exhales)

18:23.269 --> 18:24.505
(knock on door)

18:35.415 --> 18:37.784
I want to change
my plea,

18:37.818 --> 18:40.220
to insanity.

18:40.253 --> 18:42.388
I can't have people

18:42.422 --> 18:45.191
think that
about Joanne.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.460
At the time,
I-I thought

18:47.493 --> 18:49.563
she was trying
to kill me, but...

18:49.596 --> 18:53.299
I know she...
She couldn't have been.

18:55.468 --> 18:59.840
You know...
You know that I never...

18:59.873 --> 19:02.843
Ever would have
harmed her, Bobby.

19:03.844 --> 19:06.446
You know that.

19:10.717 --> 19:13.219
I want to change my plea.

19:13.253 --> 19:15.321
To insanity.

19:25.298 --> 19:28.635
I'm not allowing you
to switch to insanity now.

19:28.669 --> 19:32.438
Your honor, I was
in an irrational
and delusional state --

19:32.472 --> 19:34.340
Mr. Oz,
you had the option.

19:34.374 --> 19:37.443
You chose to enter a plea
of not guilty on the elements.

19:37.477 --> 19:39.479
I'm not about to
let you change your mind

19:39.513 --> 19:41.314
because the trial
isn't going well.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.717
Your honor, we're all
officers of the court here.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.652
Oh, I just love that!

19:45.686 --> 19:47.821
Especially from
defense attorneys.

19:47.854 --> 19:50.456
You were an officer
of the court when
you entered that plea.

19:50.490 --> 19:54.294
You're now going to have to
live with that plea.

19:54.327 --> 19:55.929
Twenty minutes,
back in session.

19:59.566 --> 20:01.267
Manslaughter
still available?

20:01.301 --> 20:01.935
-No.
-Yes.

20:01.968 --> 20:02.703
Richard.

20:02.736 --> 20:03.670
We'll give you
manslaughter now.

20:03.704 --> 20:07.641
You push it any further,
it's off the table.

20:10.844 --> 20:12.613
(sighs)

20:12.646 --> 20:13.747
I think we should take it.

20:13.780 --> 20:14.715
Why?

20:14.748 --> 20:17.951
At my age, manslaughter
is a life sentence.

20:17.984 --> 20:19.953
Might as well
roll the dice.

20:19.986 --> 20:22.422
It's possible
you could be out in three.

20:22.455 --> 20:25.559
With Kittleson?
and Bay?

20:25.592 --> 20:27.761
That little Shetland's
gonna ask for the maximum.

20:27.794 --> 20:28.962
Might as well keep going.

20:28.995 --> 20:30.997
I can't say I disagree.

20:33.433 --> 20:36.469
Early reports were that there
would be a change in pleas.

20:36.503 --> 20:39.606
That, evidently, was rejected
by judge Kittleson.

20:39.640 --> 20:42.976
We then heard defense
was waving the white flag,

20:43.009 --> 20:44.244
and pleading manslaughter.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.781
We're now being told
Raymond Oz is taking the stand

20:47.814 --> 20:49.015
to testify.

20:49.049 --> 20:50.851
Oh, no.

20:52.553 --> 20:54.087
Mr. Oz, you're aware
we're all gathered today

20:54.120 --> 20:56.990
because you hit your wife
over the head with a life
time achivement award?

20:57.023 --> 20:57.991
Yes.

20:58.024 --> 20:58.992
Killing her?

20:59.025 --> 20:59.993
Yes.

21:00.026 --> 21:01.194
Could you tell us
what happened?

21:01.227 --> 21:04.531
My wife and I had been going
though some difficult times.

21:04.565 --> 21:06.800
She thought I was
losing my mind.

21:06.833 --> 21:10.036
Suffering from delusions
and paranoia,

21:10.070 --> 21:13.373
very much as
Mr. Trevor Wain testified.

21:13.406 --> 21:16.610
Is it possible you
were suffering from delusions?

21:16.643 --> 21:17.844
I suppose it's possible.

21:17.878 --> 21:19.813
On the night
of your wife's death,

21:19.846 --> 21:22.048
is it possible
you were delusional then?

21:22.082 --> 21:23.784
Objection.
Sidebar.

21:23.817 --> 21:25.285
Yes, let's.

21:30.023 --> 21:31.357
What's this?

21:31.391 --> 21:32.192
He's giving his account.

21:32.225 --> 21:33.627
He's setting up
temporary insanity.

21:33.660 --> 21:37.631
Temporary insanity
isn't available to us. The judge
will so instruct.

21:37.664 --> 21:39.432
We're just testifying
as to his mental state,

21:39.465 --> 21:40.801
which is an element
of the crime.

21:40.834 --> 21:43.904
Mr. Oz, earlier you said
self-defense--

21:43.937 --> 21:45.471
well, I'm sticking
to my version.

21:45.506 --> 21:46.873
I believe it was
self-defense.

21:46.907 --> 21:48.742
But that belief has to be
a rational one.

21:48.775 --> 21:49.843
Not an irrational --

21:49.876 --> 21:53.013
save your closing arguments
till later, you midget.

21:53.046 --> 21:54.615
I object to that
on record!

21:54.648 --> 21:57.050
Object to it on a stool.
We'd hear you better.

21:57.083 --> 21:58.985
If you are about to suggest
that he was mistaken,

21:59.019 --> 22:01.622
I will instruct that
the mistake has to be

22:01.655 --> 22:03.489
a reasonable one.
Just like the midg --

22:03.524 --> 22:04.858
Mr. Bay says.

22:04.891 --> 22:06.627
Why don't you let us
present our case

22:06.660 --> 22:08.361
before you start
criticizing it.

22:08.394 --> 22:10.631
At your own peril.

22:10.664 --> 22:11.765
Step back.

22:18.639 --> 22:19.873
So what happened,
Mr. Oz?

22:19.906 --> 22:21.642
Well, as I said,

22:21.675 --> 22:23.977
we were going through
an awful patch.

22:24.010 --> 22:27.914
And, also, I thought she was
having an affair.

22:27.948 --> 22:29.382
With whom?

22:29.415 --> 22:30.316
I-I didn't know.

22:30.350 --> 22:34.821
And I wasn't sure
that really it was true.

22:34.855 --> 22:38.792
Maybe I was paranoid,
but suddenly...

22:38.825 --> 22:40.060
She was distant.

22:40.093 --> 22:43.429
And I thought there must
be somebody else.

22:43.463 --> 22:46.900
I kept telling myself that
that was a ridiculous idea,

22:46.933 --> 22:50.070
but then she tells me,
that she's taking me to court

22:50.103 --> 22:53.173
to try to get control
of my estate,

22:53.206 --> 22:56.009
and I'm wondering, really,
what is going on?

22:56.042 --> 22:57.544
Then what happened?

22:57.578 --> 22:59.045
Well, we go to court.

22:59.079 --> 23:00.714
And she sits
in the witness chair

23:00.747 --> 23:03.183
and says
terrible things about me.

23:03.216 --> 23:05.652
And I'm listening
and wondering,

23:05.686 --> 23:08.188
"do I really
know this woman at all?"

23:08.221 --> 23:12.559
Anyway, things didn't
go well for her in court.

23:12.593 --> 23:17.430
And that night,
we're at home,

23:17.463 --> 23:20.466
and I turn,
and she has a knife,

23:20.500 --> 23:25.839
and suddenly I think, "my god,
she's trying to kill me."

23:25.872 --> 23:28.742
And I swung.

23:29.843 --> 23:31.778
And she went down.

23:33.780 --> 23:35.816
Do you really think
she was trying to kill you?

23:35.849 --> 23:39.886
Looking back, I...

23:39.920 --> 23:42.756
I don't know.

23:42.789 --> 23:44.791
I doubt it.

23:45.926 --> 23:50.631
But in that second,
I thought she was.

23:50.664 --> 23:51.932
And that's what it was,
a second.

23:51.965 --> 23:53.767
That's all it took.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.135
A second.

23:57.137 --> 23:58.872
Thank you, sir.

24:00.974 --> 24:02.042
That's why he's a legend.

24:02.075 --> 24:03.677
Everyone in that box
believes him.

24:03.710 --> 24:05.779
HELEN: any suggestions?

24:05.812 --> 24:07.948
Just go out and
be your normal killer self.

24:07.981 --> 24:10.784
Keeping in mind,
the whole thing
rests on this cross.

24:10.817 --> 24:12.786
Thank you, Richard.

24:12.819 --> 24:16.523
So, it was a mistake,
Mr. Oz?

24:16.557 --> 24:19.693
She probably wasn't
trying to kill you,

24:19.726 --> 24:21.795
it happened in a second,

24:21.828 --> 24:23.496
it was a mistake?

24:23.530 --> 24:25.231
Quite possibly so, yes.

24:25.265 --> 24:26.933
But in your opening statement,

24:26.967 --> 24:30.103
you simply said
it was self-defense.

24:30.136 --> 24:32.806
You spoke of being haunted
by the fact that your wife

24:32.839 --> 24:35.576
of fifty years had tried
to take your life.

24:35.609 --> 24:38.679
Tell me, were you misleading
the jury then,

24:38.712 --> 24:41.648
or are you misleading
the jury now?

24:43.850 --> 24:47.754
Well it's a little complicated,
Ms. Gamble.

24:47.788 --> 24:53.594
You see, when I
realized with horror
what I had done,

24:53.627 --> 24:56.062
I had to believe
it was justified,

24:56.096 --> 24:58.865
I was desperate to believe
it was self-defense.

24:58.899 --> 25:02.302
But then, my friend and
co-counsel Bobby Donnell --

25:02.335 --> 25:04.838
Mr. Oz, I'm not
looking for a speech here.

25:04.871 --> 25:06.239
You're looking for an answer,
and I'm giving it to you.

25:06.272 --> 25:07.874
Go ahead, Mr. Oz.

25:07.908 --> 25:12.012
Bobby said, "Raymond, stop
thinking about your own legacy,

25:12.045 --> 25:15.949
"and think about Joanne's.

25:15.982 --> 25:18.752
What does this do to
our memory of her?"

25:18.785 --> 25:22.155
Well, I wrestled with that.

25:22.188 --> 25:27.060
And I decided that however
self-serving my denial may be,

25:27.093 --> 25:29.596
it was not fair to her.

25:29.630 --> 25:32.633
I cannot state
with certainty

25:32.666 --> 25:35.902
that she was
trying to kill me.

25:35.936 --> 25:40.073
I can only state
with certainty one fact --

25:40.106 --> 25:43.677
I thought she was.

25:45.779 --> 25:48.281
One second, your honor.

25:50.984 --> 25:52.619
I just blew it.

25:52.653 --> 25:55.221
Wain's testimony,
the hatred.

25:57.691 --> 26:00.827
Did you tell Trevor Wain
you hated your wife?

26:00.861 --> 26:02.929
That was in the heat
of a moment.

26:02.963 --> 26:04.364
Heat of the moment?

26:04.397 --> 26:07.267
You testified that
you never forgave her for it.

26:07.300 --> 26:08.969
I was angry at her.

26:09.002 --> 26:10.003
I don't deny it.

26:10.036 --> 26:11.004
Mr. Oz,

26:11.037 --> 26:12.706
are you incompetent?

26:12.739 --> 26:13.974
No, I'm not.

26:14.007 --> 26:16.009
So that was your wife's
crazy thinking?

26:16.042 --> 26:17.110
She was mistaken.

26:17.143 --> 26:19.646
But your rage, Mr. Oz,
that was no mistake, was it?

26:19.680 --> 26:21.181
It was anger,
I wouldn't call it rage.

26:21.214 --> 26:22.849
You called her a "whore."

26:22.883 --> 26:24.384
I thought she was
having an affair.

26:24.417 --> 26:26.987
Any caring husband
would be upset.

26:27.020 --> 26:28.722
Your wife talked
about revenge.

26:28.755 --> 26:31.324
She was referring to
my giving away the estate.

26:31.357 --> 26:34.160
The diamond necklace
you gave her for
your 40th anniversary?

26:34.194 --> 26:36.029
You gave it
to the housekeeper.

26:36.062 --> 26:39.966
You had a small stroke
a few years ago, didn't you,
Mr. Oz?

26:40.000 --> 26:42.368
From which I am
completely recovered.

26:42.402 --> 26:43.904
Well, that really
isn't so.

26:43.937 --> 26:45.906
You suffer some
memory lapses.

26:45.939 --> 26:47.808
Like any man my age.

26:47.841 --> 26:50.310
A judge deemed you
unfit to continue

26:50.343 --> 26:51.712
practicing law.

26:51.745 --> 26:53.313
No such thing.

26:53.346 --> 26:55.982
No, it was because
of what he said.

26:56.016 --> 26:57.684
And because of her,
what she said.

26:57.718 --> 26:58.685
Joanne?

26:58.719 --> 26:59.686
Yes.

26:59.720 --> 27:01.722
Yes, look, counselor,

27:01.755 --> 27:03.657
you've seen me here.

27:03.690 --> 27:06.392
Do you not thing
that I belong?

27:08.128 --> 27:11.765
You and your wife fought
constantly over your refusal

27:11.798 --> 27:14.167
to wear diapers,
isn't that right, Mr. Oz?

27:14.200 --> 27:15.301
Objection!

27:15.335 --> 27:16.937
Goes to his rage
against the victim.

27:16.970 --> 27:18.004
I'll allow it.

27:18.038 --> 27:20.106
She got angry because
you would wet yourself --

27:20.140 --> 27:21.808
this isn't relevant,
your honor.

27:21.842 --> 27:23.844
She insisted you wear these,
and you hated her for that too,

27:23.877 --> 27:24.978
didn't you?

27:25.011 --> 27:27.748
And didn't she repeatedly
ask you to get counseling

27:27.781 --> 27:28.882
to deal with your anger?

27:28.915 --> 27:31.384
Anger because you knew
you were becoming incompetent.

27:31.417 --> 27:32.753
That's a lie,
it's not true.

27:32.786 --> 27:34.187
Well, it's just like
Mr. Wain said.

27:34.220 --> 27:36.690
With you, it's always been
about entering a room,

27:36.723 --> 27:38.792
heads turning, saying,
"there's the great Raymond Oz."

27:38.825 --> 27:41.895
And the idea of what
they must be saying now.

27:41.928 --> 27:43.830
"he's gone mad!"

27:43.864 --> 27:45.031
Objection!
"He's insane!"

27:45.065 --> 27:46.232
Objection!

27:46.266 --> 27:48.835
Sustained. Ms. Gamble,
is there a question?

27:48.869 --> 27:50.937
Here's my question,
Mr. Oz.

27:50.971 --> 27:53.039
What do you think
they're saying about you now?

27:53.073 --> 27:55.341
An incompetent man
who wets himself.

27:55.375 --> 27:56.843
Who kills his own wife --

27:56.877 --> 27:58.011
You shut up!

27:58.044 --> 28:00.146
You shut your mouth!

28:05.986 --> 28:07.353
You look a little homicidal,
Mr. Oz.

28:07.387 --> 28:09.155
-Objection!
-Sustained.

28:09.189 --> 28:10.156
Mr. Oz,

28:10.190 --> 28:11.792
sit down.

28:13.026 --> 28:15.461
Mr. Oz,
please be seated!

28:32.178 --> 28:34.781
(reporters yelling)

28:43.857 --> 28:45.859
Here.
Let's sit.

28:48.294 --> 28:52.032
Okay, let's just think.
Let's just...

28:52.065 --> 28:53.166
Let's just think
for a minute.

28:53.199 --> 28:57.170
Only... Only a few times
at home.

28:57.203 --> 28:58.438
What?

28:58.471 --> 29:01.942
I never soiled myself
in public.

29:01.975 --> 29:05.445
Just A...
A few times at home.

29:06.880 --> 29:08.148
Any ideas?

29:08.181 --> 29:09.983
Not really.

29:15.388 --> 29:17.190
But it looks like
you've got one.

29:18.191 --> 29:19.225
Recuse myself?

29:19.259 --> 29:21.427
Your honor, I had no idea
when this trial began

29:21.461 --> 29:23.797
that you and Jimmy Berlutti
were seeing each other again,
socially.

29:23.830 --> 29:25.131
I just found out.

29:25.165 --> 29:27.033
There's a huge
conflict of interest.

29:27.067 --> 29:30.436
I have never discussed
this case with Mr. Berlutti --

29:30.470 --> 29:32.138
it doesn't matter.

29:32.172 --> 29:34.040
You have a relationship
with someone in my firm.

29:34.074 --> 29:35.509
There's no way
we can go on.

29:35.542 --> 29:38.411
And if I were
to recuse myself,
we would what?

29:38.444 --> 29:40.914
Bring in another judge
and finish the trial?

29:40.947 --> 29:43.149
No, I think that you'd
have to declare a mistrial.

29:43.183 --> 29:45.451
What a surprise.
Get out!

29:45.485 --> 29:47.821
You worry about
the integrity of that robe.

29:47.854 --> 29:49.590
And it hasn't been
compromised, trust me.

29:49.623 --> 29:51.324
Your integrity
is another matter!

29:51.357 --> 29:54.327
You're sleeping with
one of my associates.

29:54.360 --> 29:57.931
We won't even discuss
the wet dreams you've
had about me.

30:00.534 --> 30:03.369
You shouldn't be
on this case.

30:06.640 --> 30:09.375
Please leave my chambers,
counsel.

30:12.646 --> 30:14.848
Nice try. I just hope
she doesn't

30:14.881 --> 30:16.517
punish us now
the rest of the way.

30:16.550 --> 30:18.284
She won't. She has too much
integrity for that.

30:18.318 --> 30:20.420
Helen.

30:20.453 --> 30:21.955
Manslaughter?

30:21.988 --> 30:23.957
Look, I told you
if you pushed it any further...

30:23.990 --> 30:25.859
Come on, he's an old man.

30:25.892 --> 30:27.427
Might amount to
a life sentence anyway.

30:27.460 --> 30:28.562
But it might not.

30:28.595 --> 30:29.963
Helen, please.

30:29.996 --> 30:31.932
Manslaughter's
off the table.

30:31.965 --> 30:33.867
Murder 2,
take it or leave it.

30:35.368 --> 30:36.837
Leave it.

30:50.416 --> 30:52.653
Raymond, we're down
to closing arguments.

30:52.686 --> 30:55.622
I can do it, but...

30:55.656 --> 30:58.258
Given that you've been
trying this case

30:58.291 --> 31:00.260
and it's your life
on the line,

31:00.293 --> 31:02.128
it's better
if you do it.

31:03.329 --> 31:06.399
But only if you can.
If you're not up to it,

31:06.432 --> 31:09.570
then let me do it.

31:09.603 --> 31:13.674
No ego here.
Best man for the job.

31:13.707 --> 31:16.409
Is it you or me?

31:18.712 --> 31:20.446
Raymond?

31:21.582 --> 31:23.950
I'll close.

31:23.984 --> 31:26.019
Are you sure?

31:29.155 --> 31:31.191
I'll close.

31:41.702 --> 31:43.069
You gonna
let him close?

31:43.103 --> 31:44.938
If we're gonna win,
he's the only one.

31:44.971 --> 31:46.239
-Is he gonna be naked?
-Funny.

31:46.272 --> 31:48.008
How'd she know
about the diaper?

31:48.041 --> 31:49.042
Joanne's lawyer.

31:49.075 --> 31:51.077
You went to Roberta?

31:51.111 --> 31:53.013
Tried to get her recused
because of me?!

31:53.046 --> 31:54.214
I was trying --

31:54.247 --> 31:56.316
You know we don't
discuss the case. I told you
that.

31:56.349 --> 31:57.450
It was a "Hail Mary," Jimmy.

31:57.483 --> 31:58.685
Not good enough.

31:58.719 --> 32:01.522
You don't trade
on my personal life
in your cases, ever!

32:01.555 --> 32:03.189
-If you let me finish --
-Not good enough!

32:03.223 --> 32:04.958
I would never
do that to you.

32:04.991 --> 32:07.127
Whatever our strategies,
we don't offer up each other.

32:07.160 --> 32:09.029
I would never
do that to you.

32:09.062 --> 32:10.964
I'm sorry.

32:10.997 --> 32:12.966
Not good enough.

32:14.300 --> 32:15.702
(slams door)

32:19.372 --> 32:20.741
You saw the story change.

32:20.774 --> 32:23.209
First it was self-defense,

32:23.243 --> 32:28.281
then, after his best friend
says how he hated his wife,

32:28.314 --> 32:30.584
how he was paranoid
and delusional,

32:30.617 --> 32:32.218
change of plans.

32:32.252 --> 32:34.154
Let's go mistake.

32:34.187 --> 32:36.289
"I thought she was
trying to kill me,

32:36.322 --> 32:38.491
and in a second
of confusion, I swung."

32:38.525 --> 32:43.163
Come on, does that sound
reasonable to any of you?

32:43.196 --> 32:46.299
You saw the truth
in this room,
ladies and gentlemen.

32:46.332 --> 32:49.770
You saw an angry man
capable of great rage,

32:49.803 --> 32:53.540
who prioritized his image
and his reputation

32:53.574 --> 32:57.678
over anything and anybody,
including his own wife.

32:57.711 --> 33:00.714
She made him
stop practicing the law.

33:00.747 --> 33:03.550
She even tried to get him
to wear a diaper.

33:03.584 --> 33:08.088
But when she went to court
to have him deemed incompetent,

33:08.121 --> 33:10.090
well, that was
the final straw.

33:10.123 --> 33:12.425
The great Oz
wouldn't have that.

33:14.494 --> 33:17.664
The coroner told you
the blow came from behind.

33:17.698 --> 33:20.667
She wasn't even
facing him.

33:20.701 --> 33:23.203
He came up to her
from behind,

33:23.236 --> 33:25.806
and he stopped her.

33:25.839 --> 33:28.174
That man
committed murder.

33:29.776 --> 33:31.712
That's the truth.

33:50.263 --> 33:52.332
Raymond.

34:10.216 --> 34:13.719
Talk to any old man...

34:13.754 --> 34:19.626
Whose mental faculties
are eroding...

34:21.226 --> 34:22.696
You'll find anger.

34:22.728 --> 34:25.498
Or a senior citizen
who's becoming

34:25.532 --> 34:27.100
incontinent.

34:28.301 --> 34:31.471
Rage.

34:31.505 --> 34:35.141
Or an aging husband,
no children, no grandchildren,

34:35.175 --> 34:37.844
only a wife to cling to,

34:37.878 --> 34:40.313
a wife who's trying to
have him declared incompetent,

34:40.346 --> 34:43.617
trying to put him
in diapers,

34:43.650 --> 34:47.688
and you'll find...

34:47.721 --> 34:49.822
What you saw in me

34:49.856 --> 34:52.626
when I stood
in that witness box.

34:52.659 --> 34:55.661
But these people

34:55.696 --> 34:57.864
do not turn homicidal.

35:00.567 --> 35:02.435
And neither did I.

35:02.468 --> 35:07.407
Now, whether it was
the very incompetency

35:07.440 --> 35:09.576
that she accused me of
or the paranoia,

35:09.610 --> 35:11.344
I don't know.
I don't know.

35:11.377 --> 35:14.848
But I do know
that in that second

35:14.881 --> 35:16.717
when she stood before me

35:16.750 --> 35:18.451
with that knife,

35:18.484 --> 35:20.787
I really believed

35:20.821 --> 35:24.825
that she was going to try
to take my life.

35:24.858 --> 35:29.462
Now, anybody...
(chuckles)

35:29.495 --> 35:34.500
anybody who knows
my heart...

35:36.937 --> 35:38.371
Knows --

35:38.404 --> 35:40.406
she was my legacy.

35:42.342 --> 35:43.777
Not the cases I won.

35:46.880 --> 35:48.715
My love for her.

35:50.551 --> 35:51.585
And hers for me.

35:54.821 --> 35:58.525
She was loved, loved.

35:58.559 --> 36:01.361
Till the very end.

36:01.394 --> 36:02.663
Her husband...

36:09.770 --> 36:12.806
He didn't want
her life to be over.

36:17.811 --> 36:19.445
Believe that.

36:42.803 --> 36:44.605
(tapping)

36:45.972 --> 36:47.908
Can you not do that?

36:47.941 --> 36:48.975
I'm sorry.

36:49.009 --> 36:49.843
You know, Helen,

36:49.876 --> 36:51.745
you said before,
"this is a tragedy,

36:51.778 --> 36:53.814
don't enjoy it too much."

36:53.847 --> 36:55.616
This is what we do.

36:55.649 --> 36:57.784
We're D. A. S,
we prosecute murderers.

36:57.818 --> 36:59.686
It's always
somebody's tragedy.

36:59.720 --> 37:01.287
What's your point?

37:01.321 --> 37:03.456
Well, if you don't enjoy
what you're doing, why do it?

37:03.489 --> 37:06.026
And this case, it's as big
and juicy as they come.

37:06.059 --> 37:08.261
If you don't get
a little juiced yourself,

37:08.294 --> 37:09.896
what are you doing here?

37:09.930 --> 37:11.632
I like what I do, but --

37:11.665 --> 37:12.899
But what?

37:12.933 --> 37:16.503
You really love this,
don't you?

37:16.537 --> 37:18.572
Case like this?
ha...

37:18.605 --> 37:19.840
It's music.

37:19.873 --> 37:21.608
(telephone rings)

37:21.642 --> 37:22.776
Yes?

37:26.379 --> 37:27.648
Jury's back.

37:38.625 --> 37:40.861
Will the defendant
please rise?

37:46.633 --> 37:47.968
JUDGE: Madam foreperson,

37:48.001 --> 37:49.503
the jury has reached
its verdict?

37:49.536 --> 37:50.637
Yes, we have,
your honor.

37:50.671 --> 37:51.772
What say you?

37:51.805 --> 37:54.007
Commonwealth vs. Raymond Oz,

37:54.040 --> 37:55.441
on count one,

37:55.475 --> 37:57.377
murder in the first degree,

37:57.410 --> 38:00.747
we find the defendant,
Raymond Oz, not guilty.

38:00.781 --> 38:02.616
(crowd murmurs)

38:02.649 --> 38:06.352
Count two,
murder in the 2nd degree,

38:06.386 --> 38:09.790
we find the defendant,
Raymond Oz,

38:09.823 --> 38:12.358
not guilty.

38:12.392 --> 38:14.394
(loud murmuring)

38:14.895 --> 38:16.329
Unbelievable.

38:16.362 --> 38:17.497
Members of the jury...

38:17.531 --> 38:18.765
-your service is completed.
-Not--

38:18.799 --> 38:22.335
-You are dismissed with
the thanks of the court.
-Not guilty.

38:22.368 --> 38:23.937
She-she said,
"not guilty."

38:23.970 --> 38:25.706
You did it, Ray.

38:25.739 --> 38:26.740
Mr. Oz,

38:26.773 --> 38:28.374
you are free to go.

38:28.408 --> 38:29.442
We're adjourned.

38:31.411 --> 38:32.779
How about that,
Richard?

38:32.813 --> 38:34.480
Verdict juicy enough
for ya?

38:36.917 --> 38:39.686
Reporters:
Mr. Oz? Mr. Oz?

38:39.720 --> 38:41.354
Naturally, I'm...

38:41.387 --> 38:43.023
I'm thrilled...

38:43.056 --> 38:44.825
At the verdict,

38:44.858 --> 38:47.694
and I must say,
that the defendant

38:47.728 --> 38:50.496
was extremely
well represented.

38:50.531 --> 38:51.497
(reporters laugh)

38:51.532 --> 38:52.666
Mr. OZ...
Mr. OZ...

38:52.699 --> 38:54.635
One question
at a time!

38:54.668 --> 38:56.637
Mr. Oz, do you plan
to continue practicing law?

38:56.670 --> 38:58.672
Oh, I have to earn a living.

38:58.705 --> 39:01.474
And one thing that
this case has taught me

39:01.508 --> 39:03.544
is that I'm not
as wealthy as I thought I was.

39:03.577 --> 39:07.514
I'm barely able
to meet my own fee.

39:07.548 --> 39:08.815
(laughter)

39:08.849 --> 39:10.817
(more questions)

39:33.907 --> 39:36.743
Lindsay, give me
a second alone, okay?

39:40.514 --> 39:43.416
I'm gonna be your wife.

39:43.449 --> 39:46.753
You've got to take
those seconds with me.

39:56.062 --> 39:59.065
(voice breaking)
I didn't want him
to go to prison.

40:00.567 --> 40:02.569
But I worry.

40:04.170 --> 40:06.973
Him alone, he...

40:09.209 --> 40:10.977
He's alone.

40:13.680 --> 40:16.182
I don't know...

40:16.216 --> 40:19.853
I just...

40:23.223 --> 40:25.726
You're worried...

40:25.759 --> 40:28.795
About somebody
you love deeply.

41:23.984 --> 41:25.986
(sobbing)

42:07.027 --> 42:10.030
â™ª

42:33.286 --> 42:34.287
You stinker!
