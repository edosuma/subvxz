You put me in a coffin!

00:27.661 --> 00:31.630
You better damn well
kill me first!

00:31.632 --> 00:34.133
Come on, Mitchard.

00:34.135 --> 00:36.168
You can do this.

00:36.170 --> 00:39.004
(yelling)

00:39.006 --> 00:41.206
(yelling and thudding on TV)

(thunder cracks)

00:57.024 --> 01:00.559
(yelling)

01:00.561 --> 01:02.161
The Grinder isn't ready

01:02.163 --> 01:04.063
to rest!

01:04.065 --> 01:06.398
(yelling)

01:09.236 --> 01:11.170
DEAN: Ooh.

01:11.172 --> 01:13.005
And that's where I wake up.

01:13.007 --> 01:15.841
Every night for the past
week, same nightmare.

01:15.843 --> 01:19.011
Same scene. What does it means?
So wait. I'm sorry.

01:19.013 --> 01:21.080
Did he punch his way
out of there?

01:21.082 --> 01:23.415
Yeah, he grinded his way out.
Through six feet of packed dirt?

01:23.417 --> 01:25.517
And an oak coffin. Okay.

01:25.519 --> 01:28.353
And-and what does
that mean to you?

01:28.355 --> 01:30.089
Grinding. I noticed
you say that a lot.

01:30.091 --> 01:32.024
Doing whatever it
takes to find justice,

01:32.026 --> 01:35.027
no matter how hard the grind.
And what is that? The grind?

01:35.029 --> 01:38.063
The everyday struggle for justice.
In the show.

01:38.065 --> 01:40.699
Everywhere. Right.

01:40.701 --> 01:44.036
Dean, I wonder

01:44.038 --> 01:46.538
if maybe the line
between reality

01:46.540 --> 01:49.875
and this TV show haven't been
blurred just a hair.

01:49.877 --> 01:51.543
I'm not following.

01:51.545 --> 01:55.948
You, Dean, played this character
for a very long time.

01:55.950 --> 01:57.716
Mm-hmm. And he's a part of you.

01:57.718 --> 01:59.918
Yes, that's my training.
And maybe the reason

01:59.920 --> 02:02.421
you feel haunted
by this scene is...

02:02.423 --> 02:03.956
you, too, feel trapped.

02:03.958 --> 02:05.457
By The Grinder.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.626
He died,
but you haven't let him go.

02:07.628 --> 02:10.062
Ugh.

02:10.064 --> 02:11.230
It's so hard.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.731
I understand.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.633
Tell you what.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.568
I'm going to write you
a prescription,

02:16.570 --> 02:18.604
and I want you
to follow it to the letter.

02:18.606 --> 02:20.686
I'm willing to do anything
to get better.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.884
¶ ¶

02:34.288 --> 02:36.121
ETHAN: <i>I got to say you are</i>

02:36.123 --> 02:37.489
glowing since you quit that job.

02:37.491 --> 02:40.292
Thanks. I feel like I'm
really killing unemployment.

02:40.294 --> 02:42.127
Just checking stuff off
my list, you know?

02:42.129 --> 02:44.429
Stuff I've wanted
to do for years.

02:44.431 --> 02:46.965
Ugh, my list is getting so long,
but who has the time?

02:46.967 --> 02:48.100
LIZZIE:
Is Dad still pissed you didn't

02:48.102 --> 02:51.003
talk to him about it first?
What?! No.

02:51.005 --> 02:52.604
He seemed pretty pissed.

02:52.606 --> 02:54.439
I mean, I bet that's why
he left before breakfast.

02:54.441 --> 02:55.941
No, no, he left before breakfast

02:55.943 --> 02:57.476
because he had to get
to work early.

02:57.478 --> 03:00.179
Is that what he told you?
Yup, but he's not mad.

03:00.181 --> 03:02.781
He seemed pretty mad.
Bet you he's weird at dinner.

03:02.783 --> 03:04.950
I bet he doesn't even bring it up.
I bet you he does.

03:04.952 --> 03:07.019
I will take that bet.
Five bucks.

03:07.021 --> 03:08.887
Let's make it ten. Shake on it.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.960
Plaintiff's name is Cory Manler.

03:14.962 --> 03:17.296
Dad represented him when he was
accused of shoplifting in 1998.

03:17.298 --> 03:19.131
Now he's suing us
for malpractice.

03:19.133 --> 03:22.134
I can't believe this punk is
coming after my license.

03:22.136 --> 03:23.468
Yeah, it's not just about
you now, Dad. It's bad

03:23.470 --> 03:25.637
for the whole firm, could
jeopardize everything

03:25.639 --> 03:27.139
we've worked for. Stewart...

03:27.141 --> 03:29.141
don't you think
you're overreacting?

03:29.143 --> 03:32.044
I am? Dad, just pull
the original case files,

03:32.046 --> 03:36.315
and I'll go through it with you. Nah. Dean's
right. You're overreacting. I got this.

03:36.317 --> 03:39.051
Are you sure, Dad? I really think
we could do it... DEAN: Stew!

03:39.053 --> 03:41.186
Dad says he can take the wheel.
Let him take the wheel.

03:41.188 --> 03:44.189
Great. Anything else. Um, Todd, is there
something else on the... on the docket

03:44.191 --> 03:45.824
that we need to discuss?

03:45.826 --> 03:48.860
Right. Uh, "Dean has
an announcement."

03:48.862 --> 03:51.029
Oh, right. Yes. Oh, great.

03:51.031 --> 03:53.065
I think many of you have
probably been wondering

03:53.067 --> 03:54.666
recently,
"What's going on with Dean?

03:54.668 --> 03:56.068
Why is he acting so unusual?"

03:56.070 --> 03:58.003
Not really. No. I
picked up on something.

03:58.005 --> 04:01.573
Well... and I'm not ashamed
to admit it... I am in therapy.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.175
CLAIRE: Yeah, we all know that.

04:03.177 --> 04:04.843
You've literally told everyone.

04:04.845 --> 04:06.245
I'm on a journey.

04:06.247 --> 04:08.547
A journey of introspection
and self-discovery.

04:08.549 --> 04:11.083
And my... Jillian,

04:11.085 --> 04:14.353
my psychoanalyst, has
made me realize that

04:14.355 --> 04:16.855
I...

04:16.857 --> 04:19.291
can sometimes be...

04:22.930 --> 04:24.930
dramatic.

04:24.932 --> 04:27.733
But I am taking steps
to correct that,

04:27.735 --> 04:30.535
and as part of that,
I need to rid myself

04:30.537 --> 04:32.037
of everything Grinder.

04:32.039 --> 04:34.206
What? I know, and it's
gonna be difficult.

04:34.208 --> 04:36.541
So, I beg of you, please

04:36.543 --> 04:38.877
do not discuss anything
Grinder-related in front of me.

04:38.879 --> 04:41.880
Obviously, I can't stop you
from doing it on your own time.

04:41.882 --> 04:45.584
And I would never dream of asking that.
Sorry, I can't handle this.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.552
Todd?

04:47.554 --> 04:49.721
Uh, just a quick
suggestion. I think

04:49.723 --> 04:52.724
making announcements that you're
gonna make an announcement

04:52.726 --> 04:54.226
is, in itself, dramatic.

04:54.228 --> 04:56.728
Great note, Stew. From now on,

04:56.730 --> 05:00.232
I will not be announcing my
announcements. Just like that?

05:00.234 --> 05:01.900
Yeah, just... you just say it.
Just come out with it?

05:01.902 --> 05:03.068
Just come right out with it.
No heads up?

05:03.070 --> 05:04.069
No heads up, just let her rip.

05:04.071 --> 05:05.771
I'm just...

05:05.773 --> 05:08.240
going... to say it.

05:08.242 --> 05:09.908
DEAN SR.: <i>This isn't the case.</i>

05:09.910 --> 05:11.777
Are you sure you don't
need any help, Dad?

05:11.779 --> 05:13.912
'Cause it's like<i> A Beautiful
Mind</i> in here. Nah.

05:13.914 --> 05:16.481
Is it maybe in one of these...?
Don't touch that!

05:16.483 --> 05:18.583
If you touch something
and then move it,

05:18.585 --> 05:21.253
and then I won't know where
it is, I'll be totally screwed!

05:21.255 --> 05:22.821
Fine. Well, we should at
least get the affidavits

05:22.823 --> 05:24.589
and the financial records
from the plaintiff.

05:24.591 --> 05:27.759
I can get those. They're right
here in this area. No, Dad.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.428
They're not here.
We have to actually go

05:29.430 --> 05:31.463
to the clerk's office
and file a request for those.

05:31.465 --> 05:34.299
They make you jump through
so many hoops these days.

05:34.301 --> 05:36.001
In the old days,
you took the judge

05:36.003 --> 05:38.337
and your opposing counsel,
you had a martini.

05:38.339 --> 05:40.772
Things work themselves out.
Well, that sounds,

05:40.774 --> 05:42.641
uh, pretty shady, actually.

05:42.643 --> 05:44.776
Um, kind of just spits in
the eye of the whole...

05:44.778 --> 05:46.345
judicial system.

05:46.347 --> 05:48.313
If I know Judge Cordell
as well as I think I do,

05:48.315 --> 05:49.815
he'll throw this right out.

05:49.817 --> 05:52.451
Yeah, Dad,
Judge Cordell died years ago.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.820
What?! Ugh!

05:54.822 --> 05:57.456
I got to take a walk,
I got to calm myself down.

05:57.458 --> 05:58.957
STEWART:
<i>And he just won't listen, and</i>

05:58.959 --> 06:01.293
it's frustrating,
'cause this is really serious,

06:01.295 --> 06:03.662
you know? Well, you know,
Stew, Jillian says

06:03.664 --> 06:05.330
that things are only as serious
as we make them.

06:05.332 --> 06:07.632
Perhaps you could benefit
from that mindset.

06:07.634 --> 06:10.635
Definitely. Dad, did you ask Mom
how her day was?

06:10.637 --> 06:13.972
Mm, uh-uh, not fair. Oh, that's right.
Today was your first day off.

06:13.974 --> 06:14.973
Mm-hmm. Right. How'd that go?

06:14.975 --> 06:16.007
Great.

06:16.009 --> 06:18.377
So good. I got
so much stuff done.

06:18.379 --> 06:20.712
Checking stuff off the
list... boom, boom, boom.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.047
I have a big list. DEBBIE: Yeah?

06:22.049 --> 06:24.015
Yeah, and this is on it.

06:24.017 --> 06:25.384
I am currently checking

06:25.386 --> 06:27.819
something off my list.
And how great does that feel?

06:27.821 --> 06:29.020
Oh, I don't know, but...
You know,

06:29.022 --> 06:30.322
until I'm done checking it off,

06:30.324 --> 06:31.823
but it's feeling pretty good.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.392
ETHAN Dad, isn't this cool?

06:33.394 --> 06:35.026
Mom's list stuff?

06:35.028 --> 06:36.528
It is cool. So cool.

06:36.530 --> 06:37.896
Just would have been cooler
if you told me

06:37.898 --> 06:40.165
quitting your job was on it.
Ugh.

06:40.167 --> 06:42.033
There it is. Yes. There what is?
Why did you...?

06:42.035 --> 06:44.002
Deb, if I may?
I really admire you.

06:44.004 --> 06:46.671
Thank you, Dean.
Yeah, you're so brave.

06:46.673 --> 06:48.707
I mean, to take
this kind of time off.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.675
I wouldn't know
what to do with it.

06:50.677 --> 06:53.044
It sounds great. You know,
you have a lot of time,

06:53.046 --> 06:55.347
but then you just think
and you replay your choices

06:55.349 --> 06:57.682
and you wonder if you did the
right thing. I would go insane.

06:57.684 --> 06:59.017
Not me, though.

06:59.019 --> 07:00.685
Uh-uh. Love it.

07:00.687 --> 07:01.887
Love it.

07:01.889 --> 07:03.989
Super happy.

07:05.526 --> 07:08.360
So great. STEWART: Hey, Dean,

07:08.362 --> 07:11.062
do you have a minute?
What are you doing?

07:11.064 --> 07:13.198
I'm getting rid of all
my<i> Grinder</i> stuff.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.900
Were you not in the meeting

07:14.902 --> 07:16.601
yesterday? No, I was...
I was in the meeting.

07:16.603 --> 07:18.103
Why would we be
revisiting issues, then,

07:18.105 --> 07:19.704
that we've already been through

07:19.706 --> 07:21.373
if we already did
it in the meeting?

07:21.375 --> 07:24.109
Otherwise, we should just
do this and forget the meetings.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.544
Uh, no, let's-let's
have meetings.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.279
Let's keep those going,
and I'll just...

07:27.281 --> 07:30.048
I'll just promise to pay more
attention in them. Great.

07:30.050 --> 07:33.552
Look, I'm a little
concerned about...

07:33.554 --> 07:37.722
I'm concerned about...

07:37.724 --> 07:41.760
I'm a little concerned
about... Dad...

07:41.762 --> 07:44.296
I'm a little concerned about Dad
and the case! Why are you yelling?

07:44.298 --> 07:45.597
Oh, my gosh, really?!

07:45.599 --> 07:47.098
I know that you're upset

07:47.100 --> 07:49.901
about Dad handling this
on his own, but this is part

07:49.903 --> 07:51.136
of his growth.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.604
He's 75 years old, Dean.

07:52.606 --> 07:54.272
I mean, I think
he's done growing.

07:54.274 --> 07:56.107
Who are we to put a
limit on a man's growth?

07:56.109 --> 07:57.976
Right. I just...
I feel like if this guy

07:57.978 --> 07:59.911
throws us a curveball
and Dad's not ready,

07:59.913 --> 08:02.414
we're screwed. I would've
gone with "screwball" there.

08:02.416 --> 08:03.748
Right. Yeah. "Screwball."

08:03.750 --> 08:05.116
"Screwball"
would've been better.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.952
It's not a big deal but
for next time. Sure.

08:06.954 --> 08:08.987
I just feel like I should take
the lead on this case, Dean.

08:08.989 --> 08:11.156
Dad could use my help.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.924
But would it be help? Or
would it really just be

08:12.926 --> 08:14.493
cutting him down at the knees?

08:14.495 --> 08:15.961
I-I don't even know
why I talk to you.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.829
I-I guess
I'm-I'm on my own, then,

08:17.831 --> 08:19.598
making sure this place
doesn't go up in flames.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.600
Look who's being dramatic now.
I'm being dramatic?

08:21.602 --> 08:25.103
I'm dramatic? Stewart, I cannot
argue with you right now.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.272
I'm in therapy.
I'm very vulnerable,

08:27.274 --> 08:29.808
like a raw and emotional baby.

08:29.810 --> 08:33.111
So I'm going to kindly and
politely ask you to leave.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.113
Why's the baby...

08:35.115 --> 08:39.451
Stewart! I cannot
participate in this drama.

08:39.453 --> 08:42.687
You'll set back my recovery.

08:48.462 --> 08:49.628
JILLIAN: Stewart, your brother
is working very hard.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.463
Therapy was your idea, remember?

08:51.465 --> 08:52.864
Yes, I remember, Jillian.

08:52.866 --> 08:53.999
You wanted him
to be less dramatic.

08:54.001 --> 08:55.500
I did want him to be
less dramatic,

08:55.502 --> 08:57.135
but, Jillian,
he's being very dramatic

08:57.137 --> 08:59.471
about being less dramatic.

08:59.473 --> 09:00.972
Okay.
You need to find your breath.

09:00.974 --> 09:03.041
Okay.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.810
Did you find it? (Exhales)

09:05.812 --> 09:08.480
Yes. I found it. Great.

09:08.482 --> 09:11.316
Thank you. Dean is just trying to
make amends for past behavior,

09:11.318 --> 09:14.819
and you need to allow him
to do that. Remember?

09:14.821 --> 09:17.322
We've-we've talked about
your control issues before.

09:17.324 --> 09:18.990
Jillian, this is not about me!

09:18.992 --> 09:20.358
You're not breathing. Breathe.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.993
Stewart? I'm calm.

09:21.995 --> 09:24.329
You need to loosen up.
Remember when we got you

09:24.331 --> 09:26.164
to let Deb take the reins
in bed?

09:26.166 --> 09:28.533
That was helpful, right?
Uh, yeah, at first.

09:28.535 --> 09:31.503
Yeah. But I got it. I see...
I see your point.

09:31.505 --> 09:34.339
Thank you.

09:34.341 --> 09:37.742
(indistinct chatter
over television)

09:39.079 --> 09:41.046
(door opens)

09:41.048 --> 09:42.247
(door closes)

09:42.249 --> 09:44.416
(Lizzie speaking indistinctly) Hello?!
Someone home?

09:44.418 --> 09:46.518
Mom, hi.
What are you doing here?

09:46.520 --> 09:48.086
I thought you were gonna be out,
checking stuff off your list.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.355
Oh, I am. I've been
knocking so many things

09:50.357 --> 09:52.257
off my list.
You caught me in a down moment.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.926
Uh-huh. Why are you standing
so weird and far away?

09:54.928 --> 09:57.228
Hey, Mrs. S. Joel!

09:57.230 --> 09:59.698
I know. I was just dropping her off.
Yeah, he wasn't gonna stay...

09:59.700 --> 10:01.366
What? Why? Why not? Come in.

10:01.368 --> 10:03.234
Come inside, you guys,
both of you. Come on.

10:03.236 --> 10:05.870
Seriously? You usually
yell at me to leave.

10:05.872 --> 10:08.039
No, I don't. That's crazy.
Get in here.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.541
STEWART: <i>Yeah, Dad, you have
to fill out the other half.</i>

10:09.543 --> 10:11.743
The bottom half.
Back off, will you?

10:11.745 --> 10:14.045
You know
how many evidentiary forms

10:14.047 --> 10:15.880
I have filled out in my life?

10:15.882 --> 10:17.115
A lot. I know. You j...

10:17.117 --> 10:19.084
You can't put "N/A"
for case number.

10:19.086 --> 10:21.119
Well, I'm gonna go back to that.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.922
Relax, Stew,
you're all over my ass.

10:23.924 --> 10:26.925
Okay. I'll-I'll, uh...
I'll be back here,

10:26.927 --> 10:29.094
far from your ass. I got this.

10:29.096 --> 10:31.296
I'm gonna breeze through it
this afternoon or maybe

10:31.298 --> 10:34.265
over the weekend, and then we'll
get it thrown out by Monday.

10:34.267 --> 10:36.935
Sanderson and Yao?

10:36.937 --> 10:38.970
I'll prepare the paperwork.

10:38.972 --> 10:42.140
All right, so it's a few files.

10:46.580 --> 10:48.246
Hi. Can I have a minute?

10:48.248 --> 10:50.582
Or should I come back
at a better time?

10:50.584 --> 10:51.750
Um, later would be better.

10:51.752 --> 10:52.917
(sucks air through teeth)

10:52.919 --> 10:54.653
I'm kind of busy
the rest of the day.

10:54.655 --> 10:56.955
Okay. Then come in, I guess.

10:56.957 --> 11:00.492
What's up? Um, as you
know, um, I'm in therapy.

11:00.494 --> 11:02.260
Yes, I think you mentioned that.

11:02.262 --> 11:06.264
Before I can move forward,
I have to reconcile my past.

11:06.266 --> 11:09.968
So I need to apologize
for my behavior.

11:09.970 --> 11:11.936
Yes, you do, but... Because
when I look back on it,

11:11.938 --> 11:15.140
I was relentlessly
sexually harassing you.

11:15.142 --> 11:16.941
I mean, my whole "will they"

11:16.943 --> 11:20.512
"or won't they" fixation, I mean,
what... what was that about?

11:20.514 --> 11:22.113
Looking back, there wasn't

11:22.115 --> 11:24.349
one comment
that wasn't over the line.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.984
Very true. It's unacceptable,

11:25.986 --> 11:28.453
and we really need to be
thinking about gender politics

11:28.455 --> 11:29.521
in the workplace. Yep.

11:29.523 --> 11:31.189
Just because you are an
attractive woman

11:31.191 --> 11:34.025
and I am an attractive man
does not mean

11:34.027 --> 11:37.028
we have to be together. Does
it make sense physically? Yes.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.998
Okay. Uh, I'm starting to feel
harassed by this apology.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.467
All right. And I hear you.
You know what, I'm-I'm gonna go

11:42.469 --> 11:44.669
work on it and thin out
the sexual harassment stuff.

11:44.671 --> 11:46.304
Come back, give it another shot.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.640
No, don't come back.
I think we're good.

11:48.642 --> 11:49.974
I just...
I needed a change, you know?

11:49.976 --> 11:52.343
I mean, it was time.
I was feeling so stuck.

11:52.345 --> 11:54.379
If not now, when? Exactly.

11:54.381 --> 11:55.513
That's what I keep telling
my band.

11:55.515 --> 11:56.648
Ah. But Cody's all like,

11:56.650 --> 11:58.850
"I'm in AP Lit and I
want to go to college."

11:58.852 --> 12:00.819
And I'm like,
"What about the music, bro?"

12:00.821 --> 12:02.987
This Cody sounds like he needs
a swift kick in the ass.

12:02.989 --> 12:05.023
He totally does. He does?
Okay, well,

12:05.025 --> 12:07.025
it's getting late, and I think
Joel has to be getting home.

12:07.027 --> 12:09.828
What? Why? Because of dinner?

12:09.830 --> 12:10.895
Do you want to stay for dinner?

12:10.897 --> 12:12.664
Are you serious?

12:12.666 --> 12:13.732
Like, really, I can't tell.

12:13.734 --> 12:15.033
I would love to stay, Deb.

12:15.035 --> 12:17.001
Thank you for the invitation.

12:17.003 --> 12:19.337
Thank you for the company.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.172
Do you want to help me in the kitchen?
I can chop.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.875
I'm sorry,
wise beyond his years?

12:23.877 --> 12:25.343
Zadak. I'm just saying I think

12:25.345 --> 12:27.078
he's a good listener.
There's more to him

12:27.080 --> 12:28.580
than we give him credit for.
Well,

12:28.582 --> 12:30.014
now I know you had too much time
on your hands,

12:30.016 --> 12:31.382
honey, because that's...
that just...

12:31.384 --> 12:33.251
doesn't make sense. Hey, guys,

12:33.253 --> 12:36.921
would you mind joining Jillian
and myself in the living room?

12:36.923 --> 12:39.023
Jillian's here? In our house?

12:39.025 --> 12:41.025
Just let it out.

12:41.027 --> 12:43.394
(exhales) Mm-hmm.

12:43.396 --> 12:44.696
(slurping)

12:44.698 --> 12:45.897
There you go. Um...

12:45.899 --> 12:50.935
I've been living a lie

12:50.937 --> 12:53.071
for a long time.

12:53.073 --> 12:55.607
That's it.
And as a result of that,

12:55.609 --> 12:57.375
I've hurt a lot of people.

12:57.377 --> 12:58.710
People I love dearly.

12:58.712 --> 13:00.712
People in this room. No,

13:00.714 --> 13:02.280
I wouldn't say that you've
hurt any of us. Deb,

13:02.282 --> 13:03.414
Deb, he has.

13:03.416 --> 13:04.749
I just wouldn't say "hurt." Deb,

13:04.751 --> 13:07.218
just stop talking.
I'm sorry. Okay.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.419
I mean, look at the
pressure that I put

13:08.421 --> 13:09.754
on this marriage.

13:09.756 --> 13:11.422
I moved in here,
I turned everything

13:11.424 --> 13:14.058
upside down, and now you two
are at each other's throats.

13:14.060 --> 13:16.060
I don't think we're at
each other's throats. No.

13:16.062 --> 13:17.562
No, but you have been
a little, um...

13:17.564 --> 13:18.296
Pissy.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.731
Yeah, pissy. Pissy?

13:19.733 --> 13:21.065
Pissy. "Pissy" is a
good way to put it.

13:21.067 --> 13:23.101
You think I've been pissy?
I think "pissy" is fair.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.769
Stewart, why do you think
"pissy" isn't fair?

13:24.771 --> 13:26.738
I don't think I want
to answer that question.

13:26.740 --> 13:28.273
Isn't that a little pissy, Jillian?
I would say so.

13:28.275 --> 13:29.974
So "pissy" is a
psychological term now?

13:29.976 --> 13:31.910
This feels like a family
thing. Should I go?

13:31.912 --> 13:33.144
STEWART AND LIZZIE: Yes.
DEBBIE: No.

13:33.146 --> 13:36.080
No. You are a guest in our home.
Okay.

13:36.082 --> 13:37.248
This is exactly

13:37.250 --> 13:38.249
what I'm talking about.

13:38.251 --> 13:39.918
Unnecessary drama.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.920
You know? You're fighting
over whether

13:41.922 --> 13:42.987
she should quit, whether Zadak

13:42.989 --> 13:44.322
should stay or go.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.623
You and I are fighting
about Dad.

13:45.625 --> 13:47.091
You guys are fighting about me?

13:47.093 --> 13:48.760
We're not fighting about you.
I just think

13:48.762 --> 13:50.428
that you could use
some extra help with the case.

13:50.430 --> 13:51.930
And I think he's cutting you
off at the knees.

13:51.932 --> 13:53.431
Mr. Sanderson,
do you think Stewart

13:53.433 --> 13:54.933
is cutting you off at the knees?

13:54.935 --> 13:57.268
Oh. Really? Well, a little
bit, now that you mention it.

13:57.270 --> 13:58.937
Then let's not mention it!
Let's stop mentioning!

13:58.939 --> 14:02.507
Yeah, I've been a lawyer for 50
years. I can handle this case.

14:02.509 --> 14:05.944
You know what, I'm gonna do
what Dean suggested.

14:05.946 --> 14:09.447
I'm gonna sit in the driver's
seat of my life. That's progress.

14:09.449 --> 14:11.182
Instead of riding shotgun
like a woman.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.184
All right.

14:17.490 --> 14:18.690
DEAN: <i>Isn't she great?</i>
STEWART:<i> Phenomenal.</i>

14:18.692 --> 14:20.825
When she told Dad,
you know, to go rogue like that,

14:20.827 --> 14:21.993
that's certainly
not gonna harm the firm.

14:21.995 --> 14:25.129
Well, actually, Joel had
a great take on that.

14:25.131 --> 14:26.698
STEWART: Joel did? Joel
had a great take? Mm-hmm.

14:26.700 --> 14:29.000
Yeah. Oh, I would love to hear this, Joel.
What do you got, buddy?

14:29.002 --> 14:30.702
Well, Stew, I was thinking,
since the old man's

14:30.704 --> 14:33.037
in a little over his head...
Shut up.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.807
Who is this guy? ...And Deb's a great
office manager, bored out of her mind.

14:35.809 --> 14:38.476
You are? What happened
to the-the list?

14:38.478 --> 14:40.545
Oh, honey,
I finished the list forever ago.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.013
I have nothing to do.
I am losing my mind.

14:42.015 --> 14:44.015
JILLIAN:
Joel, are you suggesting

14:44.017 --> 14:45.149
that Deb help Mr. Sanderson?

14:45.151 --> 14:47.352
Is that what I'm hearing?
I mean,

14:47.354 --> 14:49.487
it just feels organic. STEWART:
It's organic. That's the word.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.990
You nailed it, Zadak. I don't
think that this is a bad idea.

14:51.992 --> 14:53.691
Yeah, I think it would work.
So you're okay with Deb

14:53.693 --> 14:55.159
working with you,
but you won't let me?

14:55.161 --> 14:57.228
Deb's not trying to control me
like a puppeteer.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.997
DEAN: Ah, that's what

14:58.999 --> 15:01.165
this is all about. Mm.

15:01.167 --> 15:02.500
Control. We all want it.

15:02.502 --> 15:03.701
Mm-hmm.

15:03.703 --> 15:04.836
Mm-hmm?

15:04.838 --> 15:06.170
Mm-hmm.

15:06.172 --> 15:07.906
I know I do.

15:07.908 --> 15:09.707
And that's why tomorrow
I'm taking it back.

15:09.709 --> 15:11.843
How? I'm gonna burn it all, E.

15:11.845 --> 15:14.245
I'm gonna cleanse myself
of The Grinder

15:14.247 --> 15:15.580
and I'm gonna do it...

15:15.582 --> 15:17.749
right out back.

15:17.751 --> 15:20.051
On the foundation
of my new house.

15:20.053 --> 15:22.353
I'm gonna build my new life...

15:22.355 --> 15:24.122
atop the old.

15:26.927 --> 15:30.328
Well, at least
there won't be any more drama.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.100
Dean.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.036
Hello, Todd.

15:38.038 --> 15:39.704
I thought I might find you here.

15:39.706 --> 15:42.173
Well, it's my apartment.

15:43.910 --> 15:46.377
You haven't come in
to work for a couple of days.

15:46.379 --> 15:48.880
Are you sick? Or...
are you trying to avoid me?

15:48.882 --> 15:50.048
Dean, I can't.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.216
Don't you think
this is hard enough for me?

15:52.218 --> 15:55.920
Telling you that your hero
is nothing more than a facade?

15:55.922 --> 15:57.555
Why are you doing this?

15:57.557 --> 15:59.724
Because none of it was real.

15:59.726 --> 16:02.894
It was real...

16:02.896 --> 16:04.262
to me.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.464
If you're not The Grinder,

16:06.466 --> 16:09.026
I don't know who
you are anymore.

16:13.940 --> 16:16.307
I'm just a man.

16:16.309 --> 16:20.078
Standing behind another man.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.113
Telling him that I'm no hero.

16:22.115 --> 16:24.182
I'm just a human man.

16:26.987 --> 16:29.053
I think you should go.

16:31.091 --> 16:32.523
If that's how you want it.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.661
(sighs)

16:36.663 --> 16:39.330
I'm having a good-bye ceremony
at the house.

16:39.332 --> 16:42.233
It would mean
the world to me if you came.

16:50.944 --> 16:52.944
You made...

16:52.946 --> 16:54.846
paper invitations?

16:54.848 --> 16:56.714
Always.

16:59.652 --> 17:01.019
STEWART: Oh, wow, he, uh,

17:01.021 --> 17:03.454
put you right to work, huh?
Yeah.

17:03.456 --> 17:05.523
Well, he asked me to go through
some documents for him.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.859
Actually, he shoved
a box at me and said,

17:07.861 --> 17:09.160
"Figure this crap out."

17:09.162 --> 17:11.029
Yeah, that sounds...
that sounds like him.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.964
So glad he asked you to do this.

17:12.966 --> 17:16.000
And not me, who-who knows
what this all means.

17:16.002 --> 17:18.002
Uh-oh. Feeling a little upset?

17:18.004 --> 17:21.372
I mean, you know, I feel like
I would have been helpful.

17:21.374 --> 17:22.840
You know, he's just trying
to impress you.

17:22.842 --> 17:24.208
He wants to show you
he's still got it.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.177
Yeah, but what if he doesn't
got it, Deb? Then what?

17:26.179 --> 17:27.979
Well, then he will be
very organized

17:27.981 --> 17:29.380
while he's losing his case.

17:29.382 --> 17:30.815
(sighs)

17:30.817 --> 17:32.050
Stewart, if you're
that worried about it,

17:32.052 --> 17:33.151
just take a little peek.

17:33.153 --> 17:34.652
Oh, I don't want to overstep.

17:34.654 --> 17:35.987
I won't tell my boss.

17:35.989 --> 17:37.555
Maybe just a quick peek.
Maybe just a little...

17:37.557 --> 17:39.023
Just a quick one,
just get in there.

17:39.025 --> 17:40.705
Sneak a little. Yeah.

17:44.030 --> 17:45.663
You came.

17:45.665 --> 17:47.832
I thought it was mandatory.

17:47.834 --> 17:48.900
No, I don't think so.

17:48.902 --> 17:50.835
That's what it said on the memo.
Oh.

17:50.837 --> 17:53.504
Either way,
you wanted to come and...

17:53.506 --> 17:55.039
I appreciate that.

17:55.041 --> 17:56.674
Yeah. Of course.

17:56.676 --> 17:59.043
So please...

17:59.045 --> 18:00.178
accept this envelope.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.879
You told me that
you were adopted.

18:01.881 --> 18:04.515
Inside, you will find the
name and telephone number

18:04.517 --> 18:06.017
of your birth parents.

18:06.019 --> 18:08.019
Open it whenever you want.

18:08.021 --> 18:09.353
They're expecting your call.

18:09.355 --> 18:11.422
Um, Dean,
I found my birth parents,

18:11.424 --> 18:13.091
like, ten years ago.

18:13.093 --> 18:14.859
We have a relationship.

18:14.861 --> 18:17.361
Well, that would explain why it
was very underwhelming for them.

18:17.363 --> 18:18.796
Yeah.

18:25.872 --> 18:28.039
(mouthing)

18:28.041 --> 18:31.175
(whispers): I love you, too.

18:32.946 --> 18:33.945
We're starting!

18:33.947 --> 18:35.913
All right!

18:35.915 --> 18:37.548
Your brother
is yelling for us to join

18:37.550 --> 18:39.283
his Grinder bonfire. Oh, wow.

18:39.285 --> 18:41.085
Hon, the plaintiff did these?

18:41.087 --> 18:42.887
Yeah. For a guy
who's not a lawyer,

18:42.889 --> 18:44.789
these are...

18:44.791 --> 18:46.891
are really well-prepared.

18:46.893 --> 18:49.460
Is this...
bigger than we thought?

18:52.065 --> 18:53.798
I don't know yet.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.968
Wait, are you being serious?
'Cause I was joking.

19:01.975 --> 19:04.275
Thank you all for being here.
It is with a heavy heart

19:04.277 --> 19:08.079
that I say good-bye not just to
a multi-layered TV character...

19:08.081 --> 19:09.081
but to a friend.

19:13.086 --> 19:14.752
Hey.

19:14.754 --> 19:17.088
You can do this.

19:17.090 --> 19:19.290
Right, guys? He can do this.
Right. Yeah.

19:19.292 --> 19:20.758
I'm gonna need it.
Especially from you, Deb.

19:20.760 --> 19:21.759
Oh.

19:21.761 --> 19:22.994
Ah! Oh. Come on, support him.

19:22.996 --> 19:24.095
Um,

19:24.097 --> 19:26.264
you can light the fire.

19:26.266 --> 19:28.132
Great.

19:28.134 --> 19:32.170
If I light this,
I can't un-light it.

19:32.172 --> 19:35.106
The fire you have lit...

19:35.108 --> 19:37.175
cannot be un-lighted.

19:41.181 --> 19:42.780
Yeah.

19:42.782 --> 19:43.781
Light it up!

19:43.783 --> 19:44.949
Uh, Dean, can I, uh,

19:44.951 --> 19:46.951
talk to you for a second
before you burn

19:46.953 --> 19:48.786
all of your belongings
for no reason?

19:48.788 --> 19:49.954
No, Stew, there's
no more talking.

19:49.956 --> 19:50.955
Back off, Stew.

19:50.957 --> 19:52.490
DEAN: There's no more stalling.

19:52.492 --> 19:54.625
This is the moment
that all of our lives

19:54.627 --> 19:55.860
have been building towards.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.795
I agree.
Yeah, this is that moment.

19:57.797 --> 19:59.697
All of our lives? Let's do this.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.699
Oh. It's not about me.
I'm gonna...

20:03.469 --> 20:05.703
Behold the cleansing flame.

20:12.645 --> 20:13.978
Good-bye, old friend.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.113
I will see you
on the other side, sir.

20:18.351 --> 20:20.051
No more drama.

20:21.654 --> 20:24.989
Like a phoenix,
I arise from the ashes

20:24.991 --> 20:27.291
a normal, human man!

20:30.997 --> 20:33.564
(scattered applause, whooping)

20:33.566 --> 20:35.166
Hey, Liz, why isn't Zadak here?

20:35.168 --> 20:36.167
Why would he be?

20:36.169 --> 20:37.568
You know,
'cause he's your boyfriend

20:37.570 --> 20:40.004
and he's into cool stuff
like fire.

20:40.006 --> 20:43.040
Okay, Mom, I was only into Zadak
because you guys hated him.

20:43.042 --> 20:44.375
Oh.

20:44.377 --> 20:48.212
Well, would you mind if I still,
you know, talk to him?

20:48.214 --> 20:50.348
I mean, I wouldn't make plans
with him or anything, but,

20:50.350 --> 20:51.549
you know,
if I ran into him at the mall...

20:51.551 --> 20:52.917
No, that'd definitely
be inappropriate

20:52.919 --> 20:55.019
and weird, so...

20:55.021 --> 20:56.754
I always cry at these things.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.089
I get it.

20:58.091 --> 20:59.523
Even Claire feels it.

20:59.525 --> 21:01.025
No, it's just the smoke.
It's burning my eyes.

21:01.027 --> 21:02.293
I don't care about any of this.

21:04.230 --> 21:05.596
Dean,

21:05.598 --> 21:06.931
I was...

21:06.933 --> 21:08.532
Hi.

21:08.534 --> 21:09.867
Hi.

21:09.869 --> 21:11.769
I was going through Dad...
I was...

21:11.771 --> 21:13.070
Sorry. I was going through

21:13.072 --> 21:15.873
Dad's files,
and it doesn't add up.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.776
Stewart. Do you not get
what's going on here?

21:18.778 --> 21:20.444
Look at those flames.

21:20.446 --> 21:22.280
No more drama.

21:22.282 --> 21:24.949
Okay, yeah. I...
I'm telling you, Dean,

21:24.951 --> 21:26.250
there's more to this.

21:26.252 --> 21:29.120
You know what, I'm sorry,
I am going to remove myself.

21:29.122 --> 21:31.389
The two of you are speaking about legal
things and... Yeah, that'd be...

21:31.391 --> 21:32.757
As a professional... Right.

21:32.759 --> 21:33.891
I believe in the importance

21:33.893 --> 21:35.726
of confidentiality. Be great.

21:35.728 --> 21:37.795
Thank you, Jillian. Of course.

21:44.570 --> 21:46.404
What?

21:50.977 --> 21:53.097
