01:15.734 --> 01:18.133
Yeah, well,
I'm not goin'.

01:18.167 --> 01:19.300
Me neither.

01:19.334 --> 01:21.867
Daddy doesn't like me
driving his car.

01:21.901 --> 01:24.233
Well,
I'm not going.

01:24.267 --> 01:27.333
He's your husband.
You should pick him up.

01:27.367 --> 01:29.366
Kids, we have been arguing
like this

01:29.400 --> 01:31.767
ever since your father called
and said he had a bad fall

01:31.801 --> 01:34.134
and hurt his head.

01:34.767 --> 01:38.001
Now, one of us
has gotta go get him.

01:40.367 --> 01:42.867
Any volunteers?

01:45.000 --> 01:48.934
Well, I can wait
as long as you can.

01:59.067 --> 02:00.433
Hi, honey.

02:00.467 --> 02:03.600
We were just deciding who was
gonna go and pick you up.

02:03.634 --> 02:06.800
Why didn't you use the method
you used on our wedding day?

02:06.834 --> 02:09.300
You know, have a couple
of uncles baseball-bat my knees,

02:09.334 --> 02:11.600
throw me in the trunk
of the car.

02:12.968 --> 02:14.966
Or were they stuck
in Wanker County,

02:15.000 --> 02:18.567
where, as Einstein would put it,
everyone's relative?

02:21.200 --> 02:23.166
You kids see why I didn't
wanna pick him up?

02:23.200 --> 02:26.333
How was I injured,
you ask?

02:26.367 --> 02:27.867
Well, there I was,

02:27.901 --> 02:29.767
sloshing through
the mall's wishing pond,

02:29.801 --> 02:32.001
looking for change.

02:32.501 --> 02:36.001
I spotted a quarter
way far out.

02:37.100 --> 02:40.467
Why can't they just make a wish
and drop the quarter, huh?

02:40.501 --> 02:44.467
Why do they gotta whip it
way out there?

02:44.501 --> 02:46.999
Well, I guess they think
that dreams really come true

02:47.033 --> 02:50.134
the closer you get
to the drain.

02:50.801 --> 02:51.934
Anyhow,

02:51.968 --> 02:54.233
this quarter was
just within my reach,

02:54.267 --> 02:58.266
when I slipped
on some wishing pond slime

02:58.300 --> 03:00.834
and took a header
right into the granite statue

03:00.868 --> 03:02.867
of the goddess of the malls.

03:04.200 --> 03:06.301
Half-offeus.

03:11.234 --> 03:14.201
Kids, you almost lost
your daddy.

03:14.701 --> 03:17.368
Well,
did you get the quarter?

03:17.868 --> 03:19.266
No.

03:19.300 --> 03:22.900
It was a pull-tab
from a beer can.

03:22.934 --> 03:24.133
Poor Al.

03:24.167 --> 03:27.366
After such a trying night,
you must be hungry.

03:27.400 --> 03:29.366
<i>Yes, Peg, I am hungry.</i>

03:29.400 --> 03:31.401
Very hungry.

03:37.133 --> 03:38.667
Well, good night.

03:39.267 --> 03:40.967
Good night,
sweetheart.

03:49.367 --> 03:51.468
Peg.

03:51.734 --> 03:53.500
Peg.

03:53.534 --> 03:55.966
Peg, I can't sleep.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.099
I keep thinking of
all those dimes and nickels

03:58.133 --> 04:01.667
that I passed over
to get to that beer tab.

04:01.701 --> 04:03.567
It's so typical
of my life.

04:03.601 --> 04:06.867
I was just this close
to that quarter.

04:06.901 --> 04:08.533
God, my head hurts.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.533
Well, honey, maybe next time
you'll wear a helmet

04:11.567 --> 04:14.066
before you go a-coinin'.

04:14.100 --> 04:16.067
Now, good night.

04:17.767 --> 04:19.233
You know, uh,
what would feel good?

04:19.267 --> 04:21.132
A nice ice pack.

04:21.166 --> 04:22.767
Al,

04:22.801 --> 04:24.667
you always do this.

04:24.701 --> 04:26.366
You get the slightest
little injury,

04:26.400 --> 04:29.099
and you get all whiny.

04:29.133 --> 04:31.600
You know, like last summer when
you were changing the tires

04:31.634 --> 04:33.767
and the car fell on you?

04:34.767 --> 04:37.800
Boy, I really got a lot of sleep
that night.

04:37.834 --> 04:42.101
"I can't feel my legs.
I can't feel my legs."

04:47.100 --> 04:49.834
You are such
a baby sometimes.

04:49.868 --> 04:51.366
Now, just go to sleep.

04:51.400 --> 04:54.034
Some of us feel okay.

04:58.334 --> 05:01.800
Oh, I can't sleep, honey.
Rub my tushy.

05:22.267 --> 05:25.067
Yep,
once a mighty athlete.

05:31.834 --> 05:34.800
Oh, Peg, look.
Look.

05:38.234 --> 05:39.867
There's nothing
there, Al.

05:39.901 --> 05:42.201
Now, go to sleep.

06:28.567 --> 06:30.200
Peg! Peg!

06:30.234 --> 06:31.667
Peg...

06:31.701 --> 06:33.834
three little green aliens
came in here,

06:33.868 --> 06:34.934
and they--

06:34.968 --> 06:37.734
They stole my sock.

06:39.968 --> 06:43.734
Honey, were they green before
or after they touched your sock?

06:47.167 --> 06:49.700
No, Peg. They stole my sock.
It really happened.

06:49.734 --> 06:53.999
Oh, Al, sweetheart,
you banged your head tonight.

06:54.033 --> 06:56.300
You are having
an hallucination.

06:56.334 --> 06:58.300
You were probably
seriously hurt

06:58.334 --> 07:00.567
and need medical attention.

07:00.601 --> 07:03.101
Now, go to sleep.

07:21.801 --> 07:23.633
Ooh, baby!

07:26.801 --> 07:30.834
Well, one of us
has got to go get
Daddy at the doctor.

07:30.868 --> 07:33.900
Don't look at me.
I didn't marry him.

07:35.434 --> 07:38.267
Well, I barely
know the man.

07:39.100 --> 07:40.266
Oh, hi, honey.

07:40.300 --> 07:41.999
We were just deciding
who was gonna go--

07:42.033 --> 07:45.067
Well, don't bother.
I'm home.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.633
You know, it's funny.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.133
After a couple hours,

07:48.167 --> 07:50.733
I realized you weren't
gonna pick me up,

07:50.767 --> 07:54.066
so I thought, well, you know,
I'm dizzy and my head hurts.

07:54.100 --> 07:56.667
What better time
to take the bus.

07:57.601 --> 07:59.633
So after five transfers

07:59.667 --> 08:02.066
and a quick jaunt
through gang country,

08:02.100 --> 08:04.500
where, uh--
Where we stopped briefly

08:04.534 --> 08:08.099
so all the white males
could be singled out and beaten,

08:08.133 --> 08:09.934
I'm home at last.

08:09.968 --> 08:12.700
<i>Did you bring us
a TV Guide?</i>

08:14.734 --> 08:17.033
Yeah!
Gimme.

08:17.067 --> 08:20.099
What did the doctor say,
you ask?

08:20.133 --> 08:21.266
Well, don't worry.

08:21.300 --> 08:23.166
Though it looks bad
and might have killed me,

08:23.200 --> 08:26.099
it's just a painful,
nasty bruise.

08:26.133 --> 08:28.500
Anybody, uh--
Anybody like to see it?

08:28.534 --> 08:29.700
"Cheers & Jeers."

08:29.734 --> 08:32.034
Do the crossword.

08:34.467 --> 08:36.333
Anybody call?

08:37.067 --> 08:38.099
Yeah.

08:38.133 --> 08:41.732
The Loch Ness monster
and Bigfoot

08:41.767 --> 08:44.700
wanted to know if you were still
on for poker tomorrow night

08:44.734 --> 08:47.468
over at Darth Vader's house.

08:48.634 --> 08:51.134
The, uh-- The Klingons
are bringing the chips.

08:55.133 --> 08:56.600
Thank you, Peg.

08:56.634 --> 09:00.368
Must you tell them everything
that goes on in the bedroom?

09:01.667 --> 09:03.800
One thing happens
in five years,

09:03.834 --> 09:06.834
and I'm not supposed
to talk about it?

09:08.267 --> 09:11.266
<i>Honey, Cop Rock's on tonight,
so we're going to the movies.</i>

09:11.300 --> 09:14.001
Come on, kids.

09:18.300 --> 09:20.133
We're just gonna go
pick up Marcie.

09:20.167 --> 09:22.099
And, honey, we may be
a little bit late.

09:22.133 --> 09:25.366
It seems the octopus people
have run amuck downtown,

09:25.400 --> 09:29.234
and you know
what that does to traffic.

09:31.534 --> 09:32.900
Uh, Dad,

09:32.934 --> 09:34.900
if there's any trouble,

09:34.934 --> 09:36.966
blow on this ring.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.101
The alien police
will come and save you.

09:46.300 --> 09:48.567
What the hell
are you looking at?

09:48.601 --> 09:50.767
Oh, I guess maybe
I didn't really see 'em,

09:50.801 --> 09:52.333
'cause if a great dog like you

09:52.367 --> 09:54.133
didn't sense their presence
and bark,

09:54.167 --> 09:57.334
well, then...
I must be going crazy.

10:11.167 --> 10:13.468
Oh, this is okay.

10:15.400 --> 10:16.700
See, I--

10:16.734 --> 10:19.467
I've had a--
A head injury.

10:19.501 --> 10:21.900
You're not really here.

10:24.801 --> 10:25.867
Nope.

10:25.901 --> 10:29.034
I don't see any--
Anyone at all.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.900
Help me.

11:10.767 --> 11:13.734
M- moon men have my socks.

11:16.601 --> 11:18.633
Over.

11:24.834 --> 11:26.533
Al!

11:26.567 --> 11:28.567
Al!

11:29.400 --> 11:32.133
Well,
guess he's not home.

11:32.167 --> 11:33.700
Well,
he couldn't be far.

11:33.734 --> 11:36.900
The stench of failure
is still in the air.

11:51.267 --> 11:55.200
Kids, I think you better
go upstairs and pack a bag.

11:55.234 --> 11:58.001
Your father
may be going away.

11:59.300 --> 12:02.934
I just know he's gonna linger on
and eat away at our savings.

12:03.868 --> 12:05.400
Come on out of there,
sweetheart.

12:05.434 --> 12:08.368
Come on.
Come on.

12:11.267 --> 12:13.234
Boo!

12:18.067 --> 12:19.767
Well, now look
what you've done.

12:19.801 --> 12:23.067
Oh, he sells shoes.
What's the difference?

12:25.300 --> 12:26.733
Come on,
sweetheart.

12:26.767 --> 12:29.999
Marcie just did that
because she loves you.

12:30.033 --> 12:32.934
No. I did it because he calls me
Sergeant Carter-Hair.

12:32.968 --> 12:34.233
Oh.

12:34.267 --> 12:35.633
Come on, honey.

12:35.667 --> 12:37.266
Come on over here
and sit on the couch.

12:37.300 --> 12:39.099
And tell us what happened.

12:39.133 --> 12:40.834
No.

12:40.868 --> 12:42.667
You'll laugh at me.

12:42.701 --> 12:45.468
We won't laugh at you.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.099
Well, the--

12:47.133 --> 12:49.867
The moon men came back
and took my socks.

12:52.901 --> 12:54.166
Oh.

12:54.200 --> 12:58.234
Isn't it funny how UFOs
always visit idiots?

12:59.501 --> 13:01.767
Well, I guess they went up
to the last idiot and said:

13:01.801 --> 13:04.667
"Take us to your leader."

13:04.701 --> 13:05.999
Look,
you gotta believe me.

13:06.033 --> 13:08.233
They came in here, and they took
the socks off my feet.

13:08.267 --> 13:09.567
Then they measured my head.

13:09.601 --> 13:11.366
Then they went through
the laundry basket

13:11.400 --> 13:12.633
and took the socks out of that.

13:12.667 --> 13:15.700
Does that sound like
the ramblings of an idiot?

13:17.267 --> 13:18.867
Ask Buck.
He was here.

13:21.567 --> 13:23.233
Ask Buck?

13:23.267 --> 13:25.133
Okay.

13:25.167 --> 13:26.999
Uh, Buck,

13:27.033 --> 13:28.400
honey...

13:28.434 --> 13:32.001
why don't you tell us
what you and Daddy saw.

13:33.100 --> 13:35.468
Uh-huh.

13:36.234 --> 13:38.500
Uh-huh.

13:38.534 --> 13:41.266
Well, he says he can
vouch for five aliens,

13:41.300 --> 13:45.101
but, you know, he's nothing
without his calculator.

13:45.367 --> 13:46.433
We're sorry, Al.

13:46.467 --> 13:48.099
We shouldn't
have doubted you.

13:48.133 --> 13:51.433
<i>You know, UFO Digest
has pledged to pay
one million dollars</i>

13:51.467 --> 13:55.033
to anyone with real proof
of aliens having visited.

13:55.067 --> 13:56.500
And with your dog's testimony

13:56.534 --> 13:58.200
and your standing
in the community,

13:58.234 --> 14:00.334
why, that million's
as good as yours.

14:03.734 --> 14:05.066
All right,
laugh if you will,

14:05.100 --> 14:06.999
but answer me this:

14:07.033 --> 14:08.966
If there weren't any aliens,

14:09.000 --> 14:11.434
how do you explain these?

14:15.067 --> 14:16.900
Well,
if we were in Russia,

14:16.934 --> 14:19.034
I'd say Chernobyl.

14:44.601 --> 14:46.400
Al.

14:46.434 --> 14:49.300
Honey, when you fell
into that pond,

14:49.334 --> 14:53.034
just exactly how long
were you underwater?

14:55.467 --> 14:56.934
Peg, haven't you learned yet

14:56.968 --> 14:59.433
that nothing reveals itself
in this bedroom

14:59.467 --> 15:02.167
when you're talking?

15:03.934 --> 15:05.767
You know, honey,
you've been sitting there

15:05.801 --> 15:07.567
for three hours doing nothing.

15:07.601 --> 15:08.767
If you're gonna do that,

15:08.801 --> 15:12.134
why don't you get a job
at the post office.

15:14.767 --> 15:18.067
Come on, boys.
Get me out of here.

15:35.767 --> 15:37.734
Get off me, Buck.

15:46.267 --> 15:47.967
Ah, they're not comin'.

15:48.334 --> 15:50.533
I give up.

16:11.801 --> 16:14.468
They have to be used,
huh?

16:19.334 --> 16:23.001
Of course.
The other ones were new.

16:23.100 --> 16:24.633
You, uh...

16:24.667 --> 16:27.533
You guys mind
if I take your picture?

16:34.501 --> 16:36.633
Say, "Millions."

16:57.133 --> 17:00.633
* Kumbaya, my Lord *

17:00.667 --> 17:03.001
* Kumbaya *

17:12.434 --> 17:14.200
Go...

17:14.233 --> 17:16.267
alien!

17:20.032 --> 17:21.532
Guys, just one more thing.

17:21.567 --> 17:23.032
You sure you don't want
the redhead

17:23.067 --> 17:25.001
for your intergalactic zoo?

17:29.367 --> 17:30.533
I don't blame you.

17:30.567 --> 17:32.033
Well,

17:32.067 --> 17:34.600
live long and prosper.

17:34.634 --> 17:37.101
I know I will.

17:38.868 --> 17:40.066
I'm rich!

17:40.100 --> 17:42.567
Ah, ha-ha! I'm gonna get
the millions!

17:43.267 --> 17:45.099
Did the aliens come,
honey?

17:45.133 --> 17:46.200
Huh?

17:46.234 --> 17:47.233
Um...

17:47.267 --> 17:49.368
no.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.633
Well, you woke me up.

17:51.667 --> 17:53.734
Rub my tushy.

17:54.834 --> 17:56.967
Rub it yourself.

17:57.300 --> 17:58.966
* Day-o *

17:59.000 --> 18:02.200
* Day-day-ay-ay-o *

18:02.234 --> 18:05.333
* Pictures come
And I never go home *

18:05.367 --> 18:08.099
* Pictures come
And I never go home *

18:08.133 --> 18:10.166
* One blond, two blonds *

18:10.200 --> 18:11.667
* Three blonds
Ah! *

18:11.701 --> 18:14.600
* Pictures come
And I never go home *

18:14.634 --> 18:16.667
Hey, Mr. Tallyman,

18:16.701 --> 18:19.700
we don't need
the whole song.

18:20.734 --> 18:21.700
May I help you?

18:21.734 --> 18:22.966
Give me my pictures.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.966
I got planes to catch,
cars to buy

18:25.000 --> 18:28.034
and families to leave.

18:28.234 --> 18:29.233
Name?

18:29.267 --> 18:32.334
Bundy.
But it'll soon change.

18:33.100 --> 18:34.266
Give me my pictures.

18:34.300 --> 18:37.233
Bundy...
Bundy...

18:37.267 --> 18:41.966
Is that Al Bundy, 36 exposures,
1600 ISO?

18:42.000 --> 18:43.700
Yes! Yes!

18:43.734 --> 18:44.966
Uh-oh.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.133
What?

18:46.167 --> 18:48.133
You know, this has only happened
one other time

18:48.167 --> 18:49.733
since we've been
at this location.

18:49.767 --> 18:50.934
What happened?

18:50.968 --> 18:53.200
Well, do you know anything
about film developing?

18:53.234 --> 18:54.200
No.

18:54.234 --> 18:56.468
Well, neither do we.

18:57.334 --> 18:58.900
But we learn as we go.

18:58.934 --> 19:01.033
Today we learned
that when the machine jams,

19:01.067 --> 19:04.800
you don't use a flashlight
around negatives.

19:05.534 --> 19:07.667
Were they
anything important?

19:13.033 --> 19:15.633
When's your court date, Al?

19:15.667 --> 19:17.166
Thursday.

19:17.200 --> 19:19.333
Congratulations.

19:19.367 --> 19:21.233
It's not every day
a Bundy gets arrested

19:21.267 --> 19:24.734
for assaulting
a Photorama clerk.

19:25.534 --> 19:27.567
Of course,
you were in the right.

19:27.601 --> 19:31.567
I mean, he did lose your photos
of those little green guys.

19:31.601 --> 19:34.834
That's right.
Play with the piranha.

19:35.467 --> 19:37.999
Honey, I'm gonna go
see your lawyer.

19:38.033 --> 19:40.300
He may not realize
that a previous judge

19:40.334 --> 19:43.333
already declared you
legally stupid.

19:43.367 --> 19:45.167
It may help your defense.

19:50.033 --> 19:51.733
What are you lookin' at?

19:51.767 --> 19:53.667
You know they were real.
You were here.

19:53.701 --> 19:56.333
If you could talk,
you'd back me up, wouldn't you?

19:56.367 --> 19:58.066
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

19:58.100 --> 19:59.900
<i>Mad men they lock up.</i>

19:59.934 --> 20:02.834
<i>Mad dogs they shoot.</i>

20:05.801 --> 20:08.167
Of course.

20:09.667 --> 20:12.533
You guys came to see
the pictures, didn't you?

20:15.234 --> 20:17.767
Well, the Photorama guy
lost them.

20:23.934 --> 20:26.200
Oh, nah, nah.
No more pictures.

20:26.234 --> 20:29.700
No. I-- I broke my camera
over some guy's head.

20:29.734 --> 20:31.066
You guys,

20:31.100 --> 20:32.999
there's something
you gotta know about me.

20:33.033 --> 20:34.767
Even if I took
more pictures of you,

20:34.801 --> 20:36.099
it wouldn't come out right.

20:36.133 --> 20:37.800
Everything I do is wrong.

20:37.834 --> 20:39.900
Nothing I do
seems to matter.

20:39.934 --> 20:42.867
I don't know. I try,
but it just seems like Al Bundy

20:42.901 --> 20:45.667
wasn't meant to count.

20:49.934 --> 20:52.201
You want my socks.

20:55.067 --> 20:58.301
<i>Would you guys mind
coming on Geraldo with me?</i>

20:59.133 --> 21:00.934
Gotta go, huh?

21:00.968 --> 21:02.967
I understand.

21:03.067 --> 21:04.967
All right.

21:07.534 --> 21:10.066
Oh, guys,
just one more thing.

21:10.100 --> 21:11.667
Why my socks?

21:11.701 --> 21:14.267
<i>Mizoozoo.</i>

21:22.734 --> 21:25.134
<i>Mizoozoo.</i>

21:34.667 --> 21:37.368
ANNOUNCER:

22:12.267 --> 22:15.434
<i>Al Bundy.</i>

22:16.305 --> 22:22.699
