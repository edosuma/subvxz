02:41.760 --> 02:42.966
<i>Mr. Faulk? James Sandin.</i>

02:43.040 --> 02:44.007
<i>Hey, Mr. Sandin.</i>

02:44.080 --> 02:46.526
I talked to John over at
repairs, and he took care of it.

02:46.600 --> 02:47.726
It's all fine.

02:47.800 --> 02:49.165
The system is working
without a hitch.

02:49.240 --> 02:50.765
You are going to be
locked in tight tonight.

02:50.840 --> 02:51.921
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

02:52.000 --> 02:54.082
All right, Mr. Faulk.
Safe night.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.126
<i>James Sandin's office.</i>

02:57.200 --> 02:58.690
Sue? Yeah,
I took care of Faulk.

02:58.760 --> 02:59.841
What do you know,
did you hear anything?

02:59.920 --> 03:01.081
<i>You're number one,
Mr. Sandin.</i>

03:01.120 --> 03:02.963
All right. Yeah.
<i>You got it, sir. You came out on top.</i>

03:03.040 --> 03:05.088
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

03:05.160 --> 03:06.525
Congratulations
to you, too, Susan.

03:06.600 --> 03:07.567
<i>You don't have to say that.</i>

03:07.640 --> 03:11.361
No, Susan, it's a team win.
<i>Thank you.</i>

03:11.440 --> 03:13.204
Okay. All right,
well, safe night.

03:13.280 --> 03:15.282
<i>Safe night, Mr. Sandin.</i>

03:18.840 --> 03:21.047
<i>The poor can't
afford to protect themselves.</i>

03:21.120 --> 03:22.406
<i>They're the victims tonight.</i>

03:22.480 --> 03:23.720
<i>We all got our own opinions.</i>

03:23.800 --> 03:25.040
<i>That's what makes
this country great.</i>

03:25.120 --> 03:27.441
<i>Holly, line four.
What are your Purge plans?</i>

03:27.560 --> 03:29.881
<i>Locking down behind my
brand new security system.</i>

03:29.960 --> 03:32.361
<i>Pete from Northern Virginia,
what's your Purge plan?</i>

03:32.480 --> 03:34.050
<i>I'm gonna hunt down my boss.</i>

03:34.120 --> 03:35.485
<i>That son of a bitch
has it coming.</i>

03:35.560 --> 03:38.080
<i>Clearly, more people will be Purging
this year than ever before.</i>

03:38.120 --> 03:39.929
<i>American streets will
be running red tonight,</i>

03:40.080 --> 03:42.481
<i>when people release the beast
in record numbers.</i>

03:42.600 --> 03:45.444
Mr. Cali! You're getting one
last walk in before lockdown, huh?

03:45.520 --> 03:46.521
Yep.

03:46.600 --> 03:48.280
Did you do the systems
check I recommended?

03:48.320 --> 03:49.560
Of course.
No problems.

03:49.640 --> 03:51.847
Yeah, it's the same one I use.
I only sell the best.

03:51.960 --> 03:53.530
Nobody's bothering us tonight.

03:53.640 --> 03:55.768
You have a safe night, Mr. Sandin.
Thanks.

03:55.880 --> 03:57.769
<i>Don't forget
to buy your blue Baptisias.</i>

03:58.000 --> 04:00.401
<i>Display those flowers
proudly, folks, okay?</i>

04:00.480 --> 04:02.847
<i>Show your support
for this important evening.</i>

04:02.920 --> 04:03.921
<i>Safe night to everyone.</i>

04:04.000 --> 04:06.128
Home again, home again.
Jiggity-jig.

04:06.200 --> 04:09.647
<i>Release the beast,
and Purge in our American streets.</i>

04:09.720 --> 04:11.521
<i>Your New Founding Fathers...</i>

04:32.040 --> 04:33.610
Hey, honey, I'm home!

04:33.680 --> 04:35.125
I'm in the kitchen.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.565
What a day, what a day.

04:36.640 --> 04:39.530
Everybody's doing security
checks, it's crazy.

04:39.600 --> 04:42.206
Traffic's even worse
than last year.

04:43.440 --> 04:45.283
Something smells good.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.206
Hey.

04:49.200 --> 04:50.565
Ta-da!
Ah.

04:52.600 --> 04:54.364
I'll put them in water,
get them outside.

04:54.480 --> 04:56.403
Okay.
Where are the kids?

04:56.480 --> 04:58.130
Their rooms, of course.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.160
We got an hour
before commencement, right?

05:00.200 --> 05:01.565
Mmm-hmm.
Dinner's nearly ready,

05:01.640 --> 05:03.290
so, uh, hurry up.
All right.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.970
Well, I have to make a few phone calls.
Mmm-hmm.

05:05.040 --> 05:06.041
Oh.

05:06.120 --> 05:07.406
One thing?
Yeah?

05:07.480 --> 05:08.766
Zoey is getting worse.

05:08.840 --> 05:11.366
She's been pouting all day.
I can't stand it.

05:11.560 --> 05:13.801
So, you're gonna have to do something
about the Henry situation.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.166
There's nothing to do about it.

05:15.240 --> 05:16.480
He's 18, he's not
getting any younger.

05:16.560 --> 05:19.006
She's just gonna have to sulk.
She'll get over it.

05:19.080 --> 05:20.720
But I've got some good
news for all of us.

05:20.760 --> 05:22.364
I'll tell you at dinner.

05:26.080 --> 05:28.367
<i>History has
proven this over and over again.</i>

05:28.440 --> 05:30.681
<i>We are inherently
a violent species.</i>

05:30.760 --> 05:32.922
<i>Wars, genocide, murder.</i>

05:33.000 --> 05:35.651
<i>The denial of our true
selves is the problem.</i>

05:35.720 --> 05:39.645
<i>The Purge not only contains societal
violence to a single evening,</i>

05:39.720 --> 05:42.929
<i>but the country-wide catharsis
creates psychological stability</i>

05:43.000 --> 05:46.561
<i>by letting us release the aggression
we all have inside of us.</i>

06:01.120 --> 06:02.610
I love you.

06:06.240 --> 06:07.446
Let's growl.

06:07.800 --> 06:08.847
What?

06:08.920 --> 06:10.206
Growl.
Why?

06:10.480 --> 06:12.608
Because everyone says,
"I love you."

06:12.680 --> 06:15.251
It's used, and we need
to find our own thing.

06:15.440 --> 06:16.930
Oh.
Go like this...

06:19.280 --> 06:20.486
No, I'll look silly.

06:20.560 --> 06:21.766
Come on.
No.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.127
Do it. It's our way of saying,
"I love you." Try it.

06:25.040 --> 06:26.201
Do it.

06:34.720 --> 06:35.801
I think my dad's home.

06:37.560 --> 06:40.325
I'm sorry, baby. You've
got to get going.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.481
I'm sorry.

06:41.960 --> 06:43.610
And you have to get
home before lockdown.

06:44.840 --> 06:46.171
Come on.

06:47.160 --> 06:48.366
Come here.

06:58.720 --> 07:01.087
Someone's getting
ready for tonight.

07:10.040 --> 07:11.644
Be careful.

07:30.720 --> 07:31.801
Mary!

07:32.720 --> 07:34.290
I'm so glad I caught you.

07:34.360 --> 07:35.930
I come bearing gifts.

07:36.760 --> 07:39.445
What have I done
to deserve a gift, Grace?

07:39.560 --> 07:40.971
Oh, I have a new hobby.
Baking. Grace. Mary.

07:41.040 --> 07:42.246
I made way too many cookies.

07:42.320 --> 07:43.810
Hi!
Ooh! Cookies!

07:44.000 --> 07:45.286
I hope you're hungry.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.731
Those cookies are crazy good.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.125
They're lovely.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.045
Have a safe night, ladies.

07:50.120 --> 07:51.531
Bye!
Good night!

07:52.040 --> 07:54.008
Bye!
Thank you, Grace.

07:54.080 --> 07:57.562
Yeah, just what the Halversons needed.
More cookies, right?

07:58.560 --> 07:59.561
Oh!

08:00.040 --> 08:03.647
The new addition you built,
it's just amazing.

08:03.720 --> 08:04.721
Thank you.

08:04.880 --> 08:07.451
Not everyone had the
year you did, Mary.

08:07.920 --> 08:08.921
What do you mean?

08:09.480 --> 08:12.609
You know your husband
sold a new security system

08:12.720 --> 08:14.609
to almost every home
in this community.

08:15.440 --> 08:17.807
You know, some people
are actually saying

08:17.880 --> 08:21.441
this neighborhood paid for that
new addition on your home.

08:21.760 --> 08:23.683
Are people really saying that?

08:23.760 --> 08:25.922
Relax, it's just good old
neighborhood gossip.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.082
Nothing to worry about.

08:28.160 --> 08:29.605
You're too sensitive.

08:31.440 --> 08:34.489
So, are you having your
annual party, Grace?

08:34.559 --> 08:36.369
No. Too much trouble.

08:36.440 --> 08:38.522
We're just gonna lock down,
watch some Purge events.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.125
Nothing special.

08:42.320 --> 08:44.846
Well, um,
thank you for the cookies.

08:44.960 --> 08:45.961
Good night.

08:46.200 --> 08:48.168
You're welcome.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.325
Have a safe night, Mary.

08:50.400 --> 08:51.970
And you, Grace.

09:30.160 --> 09:31.400
<i>Christ.</i>

09:32.400 --> 09:34.164
<i>You scared me to death.</i>

09:36.520 --> 09:39.000
<i>You can't keep creeping up
on me like that, Charlie.</i>

09:42.120 --> 09:47.490
<i>So, quit playing with Timmy and come
help me set the table, kiddo. Okay?</i>

09:48.160 --> 09:49.161
<i>Now.</i>

10:23.680 --> 10:25.728
Christ! Charlie,
that's twice today.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.370
You're gonna give me
a heart attack.

10:27.480 --> 10:28.561
Sorry, Mom.

10:28.640 --> 10:31.007
Look, check it out. I made
some adjustments to Timmy.

10:31.080 --> 10:32.764
I installed
a night vision program

10:32.840 --> 10:35.127
and I insulated his motor,
so you can barely hear him.

10:35.200 --> 10:39.330
And he can now play music to
accompany him on his missions.

10:45.160 --> 10:46.241
See?

10:47.400 --> 10:49.607
He likes songs from olden times.
Mmm-hmm.

10:50.280 --> 10:51.441
That is very, very cool.

10:55.320 --> 10:57.209
What is it?
What's bothering you?

10:58.720 --> 10:59.926
It's tonight, isn't it?

11:01.720 --> 11:04.246
Just remember all the good
the Purge does, okay?

11:04.320 --> 11:05.367
It's all that matters.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.165
Are you hungry?

11:09.760 --> 11:10.727
A little bit.

11:10.800 --> 11:11.847
Good.

11:11.920 --> 11:15.129
Well, take Timmy away and come
back and help me finish up, okay?

11:15.200 --> 11:16.440
Mmm. Okay.

11:32.640 --> 11:34.722
Honey, this food is so good.

11:34.800 --> 11:36.928
Isn't it amazing?
Not one carb.

11:37.320 --> 11:38.924
Oh, great.
Not one.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.846
Well, I'd like to hear
about everybody's day.

11:42.920 --> 11:44.001
Zoey, you want to go first?

11:49.440 --> 11:50.566
Charlie, what are you doing?

11:51.480 --> 11:53.403
Sorry, I forgot
to take my vitals earlier.

11:53.600 --> 11:54.601
Honey...

11:56.040 --> 11:58.964
By the way, there's a slight
deviation in my heart rate,

11:59.040 --> 12:00.610
but other than that,

12:01.400 --> 12:02.640
nothing to worry about.

12:02.760 --> 12:03.921
Okay, thank you.

12:04.080 --> 12:05.525
Zoey, your day.

12:06.720 --> 12:08.131
I don't want to do
this anymore.

12:08.560 --> 12:09.925
It's stupid.

12:19.560 --> 12:20.925
Okay, fine.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.765
Calc test, piano. Normal day.
Mmm-hmm.

12:24.240 --> 12:25.241
Who cares?

12:25.320 --> 12:27.163
I do.
I care, very much.

12:27.240 --> 12:29.280
And what about practice?
You ready for your recital?

12:29.320 --> 12:30.321
James.

12:30.400 --> 12:31.765
Of course you are,
because you're always ready.

12:31.840 --> 12:34.360
Just make sure your left hand
cooperates in that third movement.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.002
When I'm listening,
that's what I hear.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.770
All right, can I...

12:39.840 --> 12:41.080
Does anybody mind?
Can I do my day?

12:41.160 --> 12:43.242
- I have some news. Um...
- Go ahead.

12:45.920 --> 12:47.365
I did it. I did it.

12:48.360 --> 12:50.203
All sales are final...

12:50.600 --> 12:51.647
And I'm on top.

12:52.480 --> 12:55.450
My division sold the most
upgraded security systems.

12:55.520 --> 12:56.965
Congratulations, Dad.
Thank you.

12:57.040 --> 12:58.166
Congratulations, baby.

12:58.240 --> 12:59.685
Thanks. It's a team
effort, you know?

13:00.600 --> 13:02.648
All right, Charlie,
you're next.

13:02.760 --> 13:05.411
Well, we studied the history
of tonight in History.

13:05.680 --> 13:07.569
And in English, I wrote a story

13:07.680 --> 13:11.446
about a man whose love is so
powerful, that it can kill people.

13:11.560 --> 13:13.130
So, he cuts out his own heart.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.010
That is so sweet.

13:15.080 --> 13:17.082
You know, he should have
cut off his own penis.

13:17.160 --> 13:18.491
Zoey, Zoey...

13:18.560 --> 13:20.244
Eating dinner, no penises!

13:20.400 --> 13:22.880
Charlie, don't encourage her.

13:22.960 --> 13:24.121
Don't fist-bump that!

13:24.520 --> 13:26.887
We're not
in the dormitorium, okay?

13:26.960 --> 13:30.123
"Dormitorium?"
Is that even a word?

13:30.200 --> 13:31.929
Get with the times.
God.

13:34.040 --> 13:35.610
Guys, look what time it is.

13:37.680 --> 13:39.330
Oh, wow,
it's later than I thought.

13:39.400 --> 13:42.085
All right, it's time
for lockdown. Let's go.

13:44.480 --> 13:46.084
Don't even think about it.

13:46.160 --> 13:47.446
Hey, give that back.
Are we in the zoo?

13:47.520 --> 13:48.521
Fine, I want this.

13:49.720 --> 13:50.960
Hey, look at this.

13:51.640 --> 13:54.007
Mr. Sabian and Mr. Barbero
are going hunting.

13:54.080 --> 13:55.491
That's daring.

13:55.920 --> 13:57.160
I didn't know they were
going to Purge together.

13:57.240 --> 13:58.241
Are they friends?

14:02.080 --> 14:04.162
Hmm. The Ferrins
are having a party.

14:04.280 --> 14:06.009
Grace said she wasn't
having a party this year.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.730
Just thank God
we weren't invited.

14:07.800 --> 14:10.371
She's nice. But, wow,
she's annoying.

14:10.440 --> 14:13.284
All right, let's get
ready for tonight.

14:18.840 --> 14:22.003
As always, just a precaution.

14:31.440 --> 14:34.683
All right, Mr. Cali is
starting his lockdown.

14:35.640 --> 14:36.801
Okay.

14:37.840 --> 14:39.524
Are we ready?

14:42.800 --> 14:44.370
All right, let's hit it.

15:18.200 --> 15:20.089
Okay, Charlie, it's
almost time. Hit it.

15:21.520 --> 15:24.763
<i>Release the beast
and Purge in our American streets.</i>

15:24.840 --> 15:28.367
<i>Your New Founding Fathers
encourage your participation.</i>

15:36.240 --> 15:37.924
<i>This is not a test.</i>

15:38.040 --> 15:40.441
<i>This is your
Emergency Broadcast System</i>

15:40.520 --> 15:43.000

15:45.040 --> 15:47.088
<i>Weapons of Class Four and lower</i>

15:47.160 --> 15:49.606
<i>have been authorized
for use during the Purge.</i>

15:49.680 --> 15:51.842
<i>All other weapons
are restricted.</i>

15:51.920 --> 15:54.207
<i>Government officials
of ranking 10</i>

15:54.280 --> 15:55.964
<i>have been granted
immunity from the Purge</i>

15:56.360 --> 15:57.725
<i>and shall not be harmed.</i>

15:58.160 --> 15:59.650
<i>Commencing at the siren,</i>

15:59.720 --> 16:02.610
<i>any and all crime,
including murder,</i>

16:02.680 --> 16:05.251
<i>will be legal for
12 continuous hours.</i>

16:05.360 --> 16:09.684
<i>Police, fire and emergency medical
services will be unavailable</i>

16:09.760 --> 16:13.651
<i>until tomorrow morning at 7:00
AM when the Purge concludes.</i>

16:13.720 --> 16:15.529
<i>Blessed be our
New Founding Fathers</i>

16:15.600 --> 16:18.001
<i>and America, a nation reborn.</i>

16:18.120 --> 16:20.122
<i>May God be with you all.</i>

16:39.800 --> 16:43.088
Okay, kids. I know bad
things do happen tonight.

16:43.400 --> 16:44.970
But we can afford protection.

16:45.120 --> 16:47.361
So, we'll be fine, just like always.
No worries.

16:47.440 --> 16:50.091
Okay? Okay?

16:50.680 --> 16:51.806
Can I go now?

16:52.480 --> 16:54.960
I would prefer to be
miserable in my room.

16:55.400 --> 16:57.607
Of course you may.
Thank you for being here.

17:02.560 --> 17:04.642
Where are you going, bud?

17:04.720 --> 17:06.449
Hey. Charlie.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.048
Why don't you guys do it?

17:16.599 --> 17:20.127
Because we don't feel the
need to, Charlie. That's all.

17:20.960 --> 17:22.165
So, if you felt the need to,

17:22.240 --> 17:23.651
you would kill someone tonight?

17:24.960 --> 17:27.930
Look, I know this is difficult
to understand at your age,

17:28.000 --> 17:31.402
but tonight allows
people a release

17:31.480 --> 17:34.723
for all the hatred and
violence and aggression

17:34.800 --> 17:36.643
that they keep up inside them.

17:37.280 --> 17:39.203
Okay? And yes,

17:39.280 --> 17:43.444
if your mother and I were so
inclined, uh, we would participate.

17:43.520 --> 17:45.249
Because it works.

17:45.320 --> 17:47.561
You don't remember
how bad it was, Charlie.

17:47.640 --> 17:49.563
The poverty, all the crime.

17:50.200 --> 17:52.202
This night saved our country.

17:57.800 --> 17:59.165
Hey...

18:04.160 --> 18:06.731
Why don't you go relax?
We're all done here.

18:06.800 --> 18:11.203
I've got some paperwork
to process to get my bonus.

18:12.040 --> 18:14.850
Then we should watch a
movie later with the kids.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.046
Jesus, Henry!

18:57.320 --> 18:59.448
You scared the hell out of me.

18:59.920 --> 19:01.410
Wait, what are you doing here?

19:01.720 --> 19:03.404
I wanted to surprise you.

19:03.480 --> 19:05.960
So, I snuck in
when you were eating.

19:06.080 --> 19:07.809
Baby, you can't be in here.

19:07.880 --> 19:11.168
My dad will lose his mind
if he sees you here now.

19:11.240 --> 19:12.480
Come on.

19:13.240 --> 19:15.083
Aren't you happy to see me?

19:16.520 --> 19:17.931
Of course.

19:23.960 --> 19:26.361
<i>We're looking at some
live feeds from around the country</i>

19:26.440 --> 19:29.922
<i>and discussing the Purge with
criminologist Tommy Aagaard.</i>

19:30.000 --> 19:31.001
<i>Thanks, Nicole.</i>

19:31.080 --> 19:33.924
<i>Now, is the Purge really
about releasing aggression</i>

19:34.000 --> 19:35.286
<i>and containing violence,</i>

19:35.400 --> 19:37.004
<i>or is it something else?</i>

19:37.080 --> 19:38.570
<i>Purge detractors
often postulate</i>

19:38.640 --> 19:41.803
<i>this evening is actually about
the elimination of the poor,</i>

19:41.880 --> 19:43.370
<i>the needy, the sick.</i>

19:43.440 --> 19:45.249
<i>Those unable
to defend themselves.</i>

19:45.320 --> 19:47.084
<i>The eradication
of the so-called</i>

19:47.160 --> 19:49.242
<i>"non-contributing members"
of society,</i>

19:49.320 --> 19:51.687
<i>ultimately unburdening
the economy.</i>

19:51.760 --> 19:53.762
<i>Is the Purge
really about money?</i>

19:53.880 --> 19:58.124
<i>Either way, crime is down.
The economy is flourishing.</i>

20:53.160 --> 20:54.764
I can't do this.

20:57.240 --> 20:58.287
Um...

20:58.400 --> 21:00.482
Did I do something?
No. I... Um...

21:02.280 --> 21:04.089
I just...

21:04.200 --> 21:05.531
I didn't come here to see you.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.531
I came to see your father.

21:09.600 --> 21:10.761
What? Why?

21:10.840 --> 21:13.366
It's time
to straighten this out.

21:13.440 --> 21:17.047
He cannot forbid you
from seeing me.

21:17.120 --> 21:18.326
That's crazy.

21:18.400 --> 21:20.971
It might be crazy, but he's
not going to change his mind.

21:21.040 --> 21:22.371
He thinks
you're too old for me.

21:22.440 --> 21:24.442
Talking to him is only going
to make him more angry

21:24.520 --> 21:27.126
and he'll make it
more difficult for us.

21:27.840 --> 21:32.164
I promise everything
is gonna be okay.

21:42.880 --> 21:44.450
<i>America was collapsing.</i>

21:44.520 --> 21:48.411
<i>A quadruple dip recession
followed by</i> a <i>full market crash.</i>

21:48.480 --> 21:51.131
<i>A skyrocketing debt,
multiple wars</i>

21:51.200 --> 21:53.521
<i>and a significant
dollar devaluation...</i>

21:53.600 --> 21:56.604
<i>All precipitating
the worst economic disaster</i>

21:56.680 --> 21:58.728
<i>in the history
of the United States.</i>

21:58.800 --> 22:01.326
<i>Crime and poverty
rose exponentially,</i>

22:01.400 --> 22:04.643
<i>and the New Founding Fathers,
just months after being elected</i>

22:04.760 --> 22:07.001
<i>came up with
this audacious notion,</i>

22:07.080 --> 22:10.448
<i>the decriminalization
of murder for one night.</i>

22:10.520 --> 22:13.490
<i>A lawful outlet
for American rage.</i>

22:13.600 --> 22:15.682
<i>A way to contain crime.</i>

22:15.760 --> 22:19.082
<i>The undeniable fact is,
this is working.</i>

22:40.160 --> 22:41.924
I thought I heard gunshots.

22:42.640 --> 22:44.290
A couple of streets back,
maybe?

22:44.360 --> 22:48.001
Gunshots are gonna happen tonight, okay?
It's nothing.

22:48.080 --> 22:50.287
It's probably somebody just
firing off a few rounds

22:50.360 --> 22:52.203
before going hunting.

22:53.600 --> 22:55.841
Come on.
Let's go relax.

24:00.520 --> 24:01.965
Hold on.

24:02.280 --> 24:05.568
Look.
He can't kick me out.

24:05.640 --> 24:08.962
He's gonna be forced to
listen to what I have to say.

24:09.040 --> 24:10.371
I don't know.

24:11.040 --> 24:14.442
One on one.
Man to man, no BS.

24:15.040 --> 24:18.283
I'm gonna explain to him
that sure, I may be older,

24:18.360 --> 24:20.931
but you're also very mature.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.844
So age difference
is not a problem.

24:26.080 --> 24:28.401
I'll tell him
how much I love you.

24:36.280 --> 24:38.647
10 years ago,
we could barely afford rent.

24:38.720 --> 24:41.326
Now we're thinking about buying a boat.

24:41.400 --> 24:42.765
Crazy.

24:44.360 --> 24:45.361
Yeah... Uh-oh.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.363
This one has a car garage.

24:48.200 --> 24:50.009
Who needs a car on a boat?

24:53.920 --> 24:55.684
<i>They're coming after me.</i>

24:55.760 --> 24:57.444
<i>They're gonna kill me!</i>

25:00.160 --> 25:02.606
<i>Can anyone hear me?</i>

25:05.440 --> 25:09.331
<i>Help me!
Someone, please, help me!</i>

25:28.960 --> 25:30.450
<i>They're coming
after me, all right?</i>

25:32.920 --> 25:35.127
<i>Can anybody help me?</i>

25:35.200 --> 25:38.647
<i>Please. They killed...</i>

25:38.720 --> 25:40.324
<i>I just need to get
somewhere safe.</i>

25:40.440 --> 25:42.602
<i>Does anybody hear me?</i>

25:43.120 --> 25:44.963
<i>Look, I won't hurt you!</i>

25:46.160 --> 25:47.924
<i>I don't want to die.</i>

25:48.080 --> 25:49.570
<i>I don't deserve this.</i>

25:49.880 --> 25:51.644
<i>Why won't anybody help me?</i>

25:51.760 --> 25:53.649
<i>I just need somewhere to hide.</i>

25:53.720 --> 25:56.121
<i>Somebody, please, just
open the door for me.</i>

25:56.280 --> 25:58.487
<i>They're coming, they're coming.
Somebody, please!</i>

25:58.880 --> 26:00.041
<i>They're gonna kill me!</i>

26:05.240 --> 26:06.844
What the hell?

26:17.240 --> 26:18.241
Come here!

26:19.160 --> 26:21.367
Let's go!
This way!

26:23.040 --> 26:24.371
Come on!

26:24.440 --> 26:25.521
Hurry!

26:26.400 --> 26:28.607
Come on! Hurry!

26:28.680 --> 26:29.920
What the hell?

26:31.440 --> 26:33.807
Charlie! Zoey!

26:35.040 --> 26:36.804
This way! Hurry!

26:36.880 --> 26:38.006
Go! Go!

26:38.360 --> 26:39.521
Hurry!

26:47.160 --> 26:48.440
What the hell is going on?

27:03.280 --> 27:04.406
Mr. Sandin.

27:06.640 --> 27:08.881
James, he has a gun!
Henry has a gun!

27:09.360 --> 27:10.600
Oh, my God!

27:11.200 --> 27:12.531
Henry!

27:13.480 --> 27:15.005
Henry! Henry!

27:15.080 --> 27:16.684
Oh, God!

27:18.280 --> 27:19.884
James. Are you hit?

27:21.760 --> 27:23.171
I didn't hit Zoey, did I?

27:23.240 --> 27:24.366
I think she's okay.

27:24.520 --> 27:26.488
Zoey! Zoey!

27:26.560 --> 27:27.800
Charlie, come here.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.291
Mom, what's going on?

27:29.360 --> 27:31.203
Charlie, where is he, huh?

27:31.640 --> 27:33.005
Where's the man?

27:34.600 --> 27:36.125
I don't know.
I don't understand.

27:36.200 --> 27:38.601
Who is he? Why did you
let him in our home?

27:38.680 --> 27:40.967
He was hurt. He called for help.
No one was helping him.

27:41.040 --> 27:43.247
Charlie, Jesus Christ.
What the hell? Huh?

27:43.360 --> 27:44.771
We have no idea what
this man is capable of.

27:44.840 --> 27:46.729
Enough.
Enough, James.

27:46.880 --> 27:49.042
He's gone. We don't know
what Henry might do.

27:49.120 --> 27:52.044
And we're not safe out here.
We don't know where Zoey is.

27:53.160 --> 27:55.367
You're right.
Let's go. Come on.

27:55.440 --> 27:56.680
Come on, come on, come on.

27:56.760 --> 27:58.364
Let's go. Let's go.

28:00.240 --> 28:02.720
Henry! Henry.

28:03.400 --> 28:04.811
Hang on.

28:05.280 --> 28:06.281
Henry!

28:09.640 --> 28:10.880
Come on.

28:12.440 --> 28:13.771
Henry?

28:35.400 --> 28:36.811
Okay.

28:37.760 --> 28:39.330
Here's the plan.

28:39.800 --> 28:42.724
You two stay put here,
and I'll just...

28:43.760 --> 28:46.570
I'll go out there
and I'm gonna find Zoey

28:46.640 --> 28:48.165
and I'm gonna
bring her back here.

28:48.600 --> 28:50.364
Henry tried to kill you.
James...

28:50.440 --> 28:52.761
I know. Mary, I got
to make sure she's okay.

28:52.840 --> 28:54.205
Okay? I have to.

28:54.280 --> 28:56.009
He didn't shoot at me.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.086
I'll find her,

28:58.160 --> 28:59.844
I can go. I'll be fine.
No, no, no...

29:00.120 --> 29:03.010
I can't let you go
with that man out there.

29:03.080 --> 29:04.240
Okay?
I can't let you do that.

29:04.480 --> 29:05.925
Baby, I...

29:06.080 --> 29:07.081
Let me go get her.

29:07.160 --> 29:09.925
You just stay here
with Charlie. Okay?

29:10.000 --> 29:11.240
You be careful, okay?

29:11.320 --> 29:12.651
I will.

29:29.400 --> 29:31.971
Zoey? Zoey?

29:34.040 --> 29:35.530
Zoey? It's me.

30:29.680 --> 30:30.841
You okay, sweetheart?

30:31.240 --> 30:32.765
Yeah, Mom.

30:34.120 --> 30:35.406
Okay.

30:37.680 --> 30:39.045
Mom?

30:39.120 --> 30:40.485
Mom?

30:40.760 --> 30:42.728
Charlie? Mom?

30:43.360 --> 30:45.522
Charlie, you wait here. I'm gonna
be right outside the door.

30:45.600 --> 30:46.726
Okay.

30:48.080 --> 30:49.320
Zoey.

30:49.400 --> 30:50.526
Zoey?

30:57.040 --> 30:58.530
Mom?

30:59.200 --> 31:00.361
Zoey, sweetheart.

31:00.440 --> 31:02.044
Are you okay?
Is Charlie okay?

31:02.160 --> 31:04.083
Where's Dad? Is he all right?
Everyone's fine.

31:04.160 --> 31:05.685
Morn, I didn't know Henry
was going to do that.

31:05.800 --> 31:08.007
I didn't know he was going to...
Why would he do that?

31:08.080 --> 31:10.287
Mom? Charlie, just give
me a second, okay?

31:10.360 --> 31:11.361
Mom, he died.
Keep the door closed.

31:11.440 --> 31:13.249
- He's dead. Henry's dead.
- Mom?

31:13.920 --> 31:15.081
Mom!

31:15.160 --> 31:16.764
Charlie, just give me a second.

31:16.840 --> 31:18.080
Zoey, let's see
what Charlie wants.

31:18.160 --> 31:19.207
Mom, now!

31:20.920 --> 31:22.410
What is it, baby?

31:22.480 --> 31:23.481
You need to see this.

31:23.960 --> 31:24.961
Tell Dad I'm sorry.

31:25.040 --> 31:26.769
Zoey, please!

31:27.200 --> 31:28.486
Zoey!

31:44.600 --> 31:46.045
Zoey?

31:49.920 --> 31:51.445
Zoey.

31:59.800 --> 32:03.327
Hey,
Mr. Sandin, are you home?

32:25.360 --> 32:26.771
Wait, James,
I have to talk to you.

32:26.880 --> 32:28.450
Henry is dead.

32:28.520 --> 32:30.124
I killed him.

32:30.200 --> 32:32.009
I know. I saw Zoey.

32:32.080 --> 32:33.570
Is she okay? Is she hurt?
Is she in there?

32:33.680 --> 32:34.681
She's not hurt.

32:34.760 --> 32:36.728
I couldn't get her
to come with me.

32:46.600 --> 32:48.602
What are we gonna do?

32:50.560 --> 32:52.722
I have to show you something.

32:53.280 --> 32:55.362
Oh, God, I know.

33:26.120 --> 33:27.929
That one is saying something.

33:29.760 --> 33:31.569
<i>...and Mrs. Sandin.</i>

33:32.400 --> 33:35.210
<i>Your home tells me you're
good folk, just like us.</i>

33:35.280 --> 33:36.611
<i>One of the "haves."</i>

33:36.840 --> 33:40.526
<i>And your blue flowers tell me
that you support the Purge.</i>

33:40.600 --> 33:43.649
<i>We want to treat you fairly,
so listen closely.</i>

33:43.720 --> 33:44.721
<i>Let me introduce us.</i>

33:44.840 --> 33:51.405
<i>We are some fine, young,
very educated guys and gals.</i>

33:53.400 --> 33:57.450
<i>We have gotten gussied up
in our most terrifying guises,</i>

33:57.520 --> 34:00.046
<i>as we do every year,</i>

34:00.120 --> 34:04.728
<i>ready to violate, annihilate,
and cleanse our souls.</i>

34:06.240 --> 34:08.242
<i>But things took a turn.</i>

34:10.480 --> 34:12.641
<i>Our target escaped us, and...</i>

34:14.560 --> 34:19.565
<i>Several of your dear neighbors
informed us that you, the Sandins,</i>

34:20.960 --> 34:23.485
<i>have inexplicably
given him sanctuary.</i>

34:25.320 --> 34:27.129
<i>Mr. and Mrs., the man
you're sheltering is nothing</i>

34:27.199 --> 34:29.123
<i>but a dirty, homeless pig.</i>

34:29.360 --> 34:31.681
<i>A grotesque menace
to our just society,</i>

34:31.760 --> 34:34.127
<i>who had the audacity
to fight back,</i>

34:34.199 --> 34:37.487
<i>killing one of us when we
attempted to execute him tonight.</i>

34:37.719 --> 34:39.404
<i>The pig doesn't know his place,</i>

34:39.480 --> 34:41.608
<i>and now he needs
to be taught a lesson.</i>

34:41.880 --> 34:43.848
<i>You need to return him to us.</i>

34:44.719 --> 34:46.051
<i>Alive.</i>

34:47.159 --> 34:49.561
<i>So that we may Purge
as we are entitled.</i>

34:51.520 --> 34:53.443
<i>Here's the plan, Sandins.</i>

34:54.360 --> 34:55.646
<i>You have until our
provisions arrive,</i>

34:55.719 --> 34:58.690
<i>provisions which will help us
break into your elegant home.</i>

35:00.720 --> 35:02.165
<i>If you don't...</i>

35:03.120 --> 35:04.963
<i>If you don't deliver him
by the aforementioned time,</i>

35:05.080 --> 35:07.208
<i>we'll release
the beast on him...</i>

35:09.280 --> 35:10.725
<i>And on you.</i>

35:10.800 --> 35:15.442
<i>And, um, we can enter
any home we want.</i>

35:15.520 --> 35:20.481
<i>And we will want as wanting is
our will on this fine night.</i>

35:22.800 --> 35:24.882
<i>Don't force us to hurt you.</i>

35:25.560 --> 35:27.369
<i>We don't want to kill our own.</i>

35:30.160 --> 35:32.845
<i>Please, just let us Purge.</i>

35:35.520 --> 35:37.522
<i>Toodle-oo, Sandins.</i>

35:42.080 --> 35:43.320
<i>Cut it. Cut it now.</i>

36:00.320 --> 36:02.561
The monitors are
working on backup.

36:03.320 --> 36:04.731
The power's out
in the whole house.

36:06.080 --> 36:07.411
James, they can't
get in here, right?

36:07.480 --> 36:09.687
They can't get into our home.

36:09.760 --> 36:10.886
I don't know.

36:11.120 --> 36:12.451
It's hard to say.

36:12.520 --> 36:14.249
You don't know?

36:14.840 --> 36:16.569
You sell these
security systems.

36:16.640 --> 36:18.005
What do you mean,
you don't know?

36:18.080 --> 36:21.323
We have tested the system. It
works 99 percent of the time.

36:21.400 --> 36:23.926
It looks good. It's strong.
People stay away.

36:24.560 --> 36:25.800
It looks good?

36:25.880 --> 36:28.281
It's not built
for worst-case scenarios.

36:28.360 --> 36:31.728
Is it impenetrable?
No, nothing's impenetrable.

36:33.080 --> 36:36.004
Things like this are not supposed
to happen in our neighborhood.

36:36.080 --> 36:38.367
Well, they are
happening, James.

36:38.440 --> 36:41.046
They're happening right now.
Do you see this?

36:45.680 --> 36:47.921
Okay, listen, just sit down.
Sit down, please.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.809
We gotta calm down.
Sit down.

36:50.200 --> 36:52.601
All right. Sit down, sit down.
Listen.

36:53.040 --> 36:56.442
Okay, to answer your question,
yes, they could get in here.

36:57.160 --> 36:58.571
They could tunnel
underneath us.

36:58.640 --> 37:00.051
They could smoke us out.

37:00.120 --> 37:03.124
They could devise
a battering ram, okay?

37:03.240 --> 37:06.687
I'm sorry, but it's true. So,
here's what we're gonna do.

37:08.160 --> 37:09.810
We're gonna give
them what they want.

37:10.680 --> 37:15.846
We're gonna find that man and
we're gonna force him outside.

37:17.800 --> 37:22.328
Now, we have guns,
and he doesn't.

37:22.400 --> 37:25.324
But they'll kill him.

37:25.800 --> 37:27.006
Why should he die?

37:27.080 --> 37:28.844
It's him or us, Charlie.

38:28.320 --> 38:30.766
Why don't you
give us the homeless man?

38:30.840 --> 38:33.366
No one will
miss him when he's gone.

38:33.440 --> 38:36.091
Pretty please.

39:39.800 --> 39:41.484
Wait a minute.

39:42.880 --> 39:44.484
Shit.

39:56.240 --> 39:57.651
Where is he?

40:20.680 --> 40:21.761
There he is.

41:12.920 --> 41:14.331
Look at me.

41:17.920 --> 41:19.922
Come on, look over here.

42:25.560 --> 42:26.800
Where are you?

42:56.040 --> 42:57.166
Come on.

44:45.800 --> 44:48.201
Dear Mr. Sandin!

44:48.800 --> 44:51.929
Sorry to interrupt, but
I'd love to have a word.

44:53.280 --> 44:56.648
Meet me by your front door. I
just need a moment, good sir.

45:05.760 --> 45:07.489
There you are.

45:08.880 --> 45:11.201
Thank you for accepting
my invitation.

45:12.120 --> 45:15.408
Tell me, why haven't you delivered
the filthy swine to me yet?

45:16.880 --> 45:18.848
Are you protecting him?

45:20.200 --> 45:22.601
I surely hope not,
Mr. Sandin.

45:22.680 --> 45:24.569
No. Of course not.

45:24.640 --> 45:25.926
We just can't find him.

45:26.480 --> 45:28.721
You see,
this is a misunderstanding.

45:28.800 --> 45:30.325
My son let him in.

45:30.400 --> 45:32.243
He's a young boy.
He doesn't know better.

45:32.320 --> 45:35.403
But I support what occurs here
tonight 100 percent, okay?

45:35.480 --> 45:37.369
I sell security equipment.

45:37.440 --> 45:39.249
So, I would never deny yours,

45:39.320 --> 45:41.084
or anybody else's
right to Purge.

45:41.160 --> 45:45.006
Just give us the
homeless pig, you fuck!

45:50.960 --> 45:52.769
Sorry about that.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.923
I don't condone
that kind of behavior.

45:55.160 --> 45:57.686
But just keep in mind,
Mr. Sandin...

45:59.000 --> 46:00.843
He was my friend,

46:00.920 --> 46:03.685
and you are not.

46:06.600 --> 46:08.967
Our equipment is arriving soon.

46:09.520 --> 46:11.363
And we will get in.

46:13.840 --> 46:15.888
Send out he, or that...

46:16.640 --> 46:18.483
Will be thee.

46:21.880 --> 46:22.881
I'll go get him.

46:22.960 --> 46:24.485
You should do that.

47:20.680 --> 47:21.966
<i>Hey, Charlie.</i>

47:24.400 --> 47:26.846
<i>I don't know what's going on.</i>

47:26.920 --> 47:29.207
<i>There are people outside.</i>

47:29.280 --> 47:30.361
<i>Um...</i>

47:32.560 --> 47:34.528
<i>And Henry's dead.</i>

47:35.760 --> 47:38.809
<i>I'll be okay.
I have his gun.</i>

47:39.200 --> 47:41.123
<i>Stay where you are.</i>

47:41.200 --> 47:43.168
<i>Please be safe, okay?</i>

47:44.680 --> 47:46.967
<i>I'm going to go hide
in your secret spot.</i>

47:47.200 --> 47:48.440
No.

47:49.760 --> 47:51.444
<i>All right? I love you.</i>

48:15.760 --> 48:16.841
Don't.

48:17.480 --> 48:18.481
Zoey.

48:19.640 --> 48:21.165
Get back.

48:22.520 --> 48:24.363
Into the hall.
Let's go.

48:24.640 --> 48:26.324
Drop your gun.

48:27.040 --> 48:28.405
Dad, please.

48:32.360 --> 48:33.850
Drop it.

48:36.240 --> 48:37.401
<i>Don't hurt her.</i>

48:37.480 --> 48:39.687
<i>Lower your weapon.</i>

48:40.040 --> 48:42.441
Zoey, I will not
let him hurt you.

48:42.520 --> 48:45.603
Leave her alone,
you son of a bitch.

48:45.880 --> 48:47.803
I will let her go
when this night is over.

48:47.880 --> 48:49.291
You're gonna get us
all killed. You know that.

48:49.360 --> 48:51.521
They're coming in here, and
they are gonna kill us all.

48:51.840 --> 48:53.920
They are gonna come in here,
and they are... Back up.

48:54.520 --> 48:56.761
You got to leave my
family out of this. Okay?

48:56.840 --> 48:58.001
If you don't drop your gun,

48:58.120 --> 48:59.929
I will hurt her
and I will hurt you.

49:00.040 --> 49:01.644
We didn't do anything to you.

49:01.760 --> 49:05.003
We don't deserve this. I
don't deserve this either.

49:05.080 --> 49:06.889
Now, listen, I don't
want to hurt any of you,

49:08.680 --> 49:11.331
but I am not dying tonight!

49:14.800 --> 49:15.881
Drop your gun.

49:15.960 --> 49:17.291
Please.
Drop it.

49:18.680 --> 49:20.011
Put the gun down.

49:20.080 --> 49:22.208
Listen to me.
Okay.

49:22.680 --> 49:24.364
You are going to die tonight.

49:24.760 --> 49:27.001
And you can either
die like a man,

49:27.080 --> 49:29.128
and walk outside
there by yourself,

49:29.200 --> 49:30.964
or you can die like a coward

49:31.040 --> 49:34.203
and get my wife and my children
killed along with you.

49:34.280 --> 49:37.568
Okay? So take that gun away
from my daughter's head!

49:37.880 --> 49:39.320
Shoot him, Mary! Shoot him!

49:47.400 --> 49:49.209
Get off me!

49:53.800 --> 49:55.211
Stop!

49:55.520 --> 49:57.124
Shit. Shit.

49:57.960 --> 49:59.485
Mary? Mary!

49:59.600 --> 50:00.601
Zoey!

50:00.680 --> 50:03.286
She's unconscious. She hit her head.

50:09.880 --> 50:11.405
Mary, are you okay?

50:12.920 --> 50:14.922
We got to get some rope.
What?

50:15.080 --> 50:17.970
Mary, we have to get some rope

50:18.040 --> 50:21.203
and we have to tie him up
and get him outside.

50:21.320 --> 50:23.084
And we're gonna end
this goddamn night.

50:23.280 --> 50:24.884
All right?
Do you hear me?

50:25.000 --> 50:26.445
Okay. Okay.

50:27.360 --> 50:29.522
All right. Come on,
Charlie, help me.

50:29.600 --> 50:30.965
Sweetheart?

50:31.960 --> 50:33.405
Sweetheart?

50:34.760 --> 50:38.606
Okay, I'm almost done here. As
soon as you get the legs secure...

50:38.800 --> 50:41.201
You got it? All right, let me see.
Let me see. Good job.

50:41.440 --> 50:43.044
You're doing great, honey.

50:43.120 --> 50:45.691
Here's what we're gonna do. We're
gonna roll him into that chair,

50:45.920 --> 50:47.046
and we're gonna
drag him outside

50:47.120 --> 50:48.246
and we're gonna
be done, all right?

50:48.280 --> 50:50.123
Mmm-hmm. You got it?
All right, we ready?

50:51.280 --> 50:53.851
Charlie, just concentrate
on your sister, okay?

50:53.920 --> 50:55.490
See if she's waking up.

50:55.760 --> 50:57.250
Except, Charlie,
I need the light.

50:57.320 --> 50:59.209
Thank you, son. Okay.

50:59.400 --> 51:01.721
Hey, good job.
You're doing great.

51:01.800 --> 51:03.404
All right. Let me get
the chair, here.

51:03.480 --> 51:05.482
Okay, we are almost done.

51:06.880 --> 51:08.689
I'm gonna pick him up on the
count of three, all right?

51:08.760 --> 51:09.727
You're gonna help me.

51:09.800 --> 51:13.088
Keep the light on us, Charlie.
Ready? One, two...

51:13.160 --> 51:14.241
Three!

51:17.240 --> 51:18.765
Okay.

51:18.840 --> 51:22.083
Great. Now, let's get the
tape and tape him in there.

51:23.520 --> 51:24.760
Whoa!
Hey, hey, hey!

51:24.840 --> 51:26.922
I've got him, I've got him.
I got him.

51:27.320 --> 51:29.288
Okay. Okay, all right!

51:30.240 --> 51:32.288
You got to calm down. He's
gonna break this tape!

51:33.280 --> 51:35.123
Press on his wound.
What?

51:35.360 --> 51:37.567
Get the letter opener
and press on his wound!

51:38.680 --> 51:40.125
Get the letter
opener on the desk!

51:40.920 --> 51:42.604
Grab the letter opener!

51:42.680 --> 51:43.886
No, Mom!

51:44.280 --> 51:47.090
Listen to me. I am just
trying to protect my family.

51:50.120 --> 51:51.451
Just calm down.

51:52.640 --> 51:53.641
Mom!

51:53.800 --> 51:54.961
Come on, do it.

51:55.040 --> 51:56.326
Do it, Mary!
Do it!

51:56.400 --> 51:57.686
Press on his wound!

51:58.040 --> 51:59.280
Yes!

51:59.360 --> 52:00.361
Mom!

52:00.720 --> 52:01.721
You want her to do it again?

52:01.800 --> 52:02.767
Mom, stop!

52:02.880 --> 52:05.240
Just do it again, Mary.

52:06.560 --> 52:08.164
Okay. All right.

52:08.600 --> 52:11.001
Okay. Ready to sit
in the chair?

52:12.280 --> 52:14.931
Yeah, he's ready.
Help me up. Help me up.

52:16.640 --> 52:19.371
Ready? Okay.

52:24.800 --> 52:26.768
Stay there, all right?
Stop it.

52:26.840 --> 52:28.842
Just let me take you
in this chair. All right?

52:28.920 --> 52:30.843
Mary, where's the tape?

52:35.080 --> 52:38.482
You are making this much more
difficult than it needs to be.

52:38.560 --> 52:40.483
You understand me? Huh?

52:52.240 --> 52:53.685
Christ, look at us.
Look at this man.

52:53.760 --> 52:55.000
Look at what
we're doing to him.

53:03.760 --> 53:04.761
Come on, Mary.

53:04.840 --> 53:06.569
Let's get this over with.

53:10.440 --> 53:11.771
Come on, Mary.

53:20.400 --> 53:21.526
It's okay, Mary.

53:21.880 --> 53:23.245
I can't.
Oh, yes, you can.

53:23.320 --> 53:25.322
I need you right now, okay?

53:25.400 --> 53:29.121
Hey, look at me. Huh?
Look at me, Mary.

53:29.680 --> 53:31.330
Mary.

53:31.400 --> 53:33.971
It's wrong. It's so wrong.
We don't have a choice.

53:34.760 --> 53:35.727
This is so wrong.

53:35.800 --> 53:37.040
We don't have any other choice.

53:37.080 --> 53:39.560
Don't touch me.
Look at you.

53:40.760 --> 53:43.491
No, no, no.
Don't touch me.

53:45.280 --> 53:46.805
When did this happen?

53:51.960 --> 53:53.724
James, look at you.

53:54.640 --> 53:56.563
What the hell
happened to us, James?

53:58.680 --> 54:00.011
Charlie.

54:01.480 --> 54:05.087
Charlie? Baby, where did you go?
Charlie?

54:10.840 --> 54:12.171
Charlie!

54:13.200 --> 54:15.043
Charlie, where are you, baby?

54:15.120 --> 54:17.009
Charlie!

54:34.360 --> 54:37.204
Zoey. Hey,
are you all right?

54:38.000 --> 54:39.206
Sit down, sit down.

54:39.280 --> 54:41.726
You hit your head.
Are you okay?

54:41.840 --> 54:43.126
Oh, God.

54:46.600 --> 54:51.128
I am so sorry
about Henry, okay?

54:51.320 --> 54:52.845
I'm so sorry.

54:52.920 --> 54:54.920
But we're gonna make it
through tonight, all right?

54:54.960 --> 54:58.646
We will, and everything
is gonna be okay.

54:59.520 --> 55:01.522
It's not gonna be okay.

55:02.240 --> 55:03.321
What?

55:03.400 --> 55:05.880
Look at what you're doing.

55:06.640 --> 55:09.928
Nothing is ever
going to be okay again.

55:11.720 --> 55:14.451
Don't say that.

55:33.920 --> 55:35.763
Save your children.

55:37.560 --> 55:39.244
Take me outside.

56:02.160 --> 56:04.766
Charlie? Charlie!

56:13.000 --> 56:16.083
I want all
these barricades down!

56:16.160 --> 56:19.767
Get chains on every
door and every window!

56:23.920 --> 56:25.001
James, where's Zoey?

56:25.080 --> 56:26.047
I don't know, she ran out here.

56:26.120 --> 56:27.724
Those freaks outside
are coming in!

56:27.800 --> 56:29.370
They have chains on the
doors and windows.

56:29.440 --> 56:31.408
They're gonna pull them
off and come inside.

56:31.480 --> 56:32.561
Maybe you were right.

56:32.640 --> 56:35.041
No, I wasn't right
about anything.

56:35.880 --> 56:38.451
You're not sending him outside?

56:39.200 --> 56:40.725
I have another idea.

56:40.800 --> 56:42.040
What are you gonna do?

56:42.160 --> 56:43.571
Charlie!

56:43.640 --> 56:45.722
Charlie, listen to me.

56:45.800 --> 56:47.245
You take this gun.

56:47.320 --> 56:48.731
Dad, are you
sending him outside?

56:48.840 --> 56:49.841
No. All right?

56:49.920 --> 56:51.365
You're gonna go hide
in the basement

56:51.440 --> 56:53.249
and you're not gonna come
out for anybody, all right?

56:53.320 --> 56:54.765
Okay.
You're a good boy.

56:54.840 --> 56:56.604
All right, go, go.

56:56.680 --> 56:58.250
You just gave our son a gun.

56:58.320 --> 57:00.971
You want to tell me
what the hell we're doing?

57:01.040 --> 57:02.849
We're gonna fight.

57:07.600 --> 57:10.809
I want you to take this one as well.
Safety's off.

57:11.240 --> 57:12.605
You're gonna use
a lot of rounds.

57:12.680 --> 57:14.284
What do I do?

57:14.360 --> 57:16.362
You're gonna cover the
other side of the house.

57:16.440 --> 57:18.329
This is our home.
Our kids live here.

57:18.400 --> 57:20.050
Anybody tries to come
in, you blast them.

57:20.120 --> 57:21.849
You will not hesitate.
Mmm.

57:26.120 --> 57:28.282
Dear Mr. and Mrs.!

57:28.680 --> 57:33.208
I'm sorry to tell you this, but
your time is essentially up.

57:34.280 --> 57:35.884
And you failed!

57:36.720 --> 57:39.963
You failed to deliver
the homeless swine!

57:42.080 --> 57:46.847
I'm very disappointed as you
fine folk should know better!

57:46.920 --> 57:50.083
That piece of filth
that you are protecting

57:50.160 --> 57:54.051
exists only to serve
our need to Purge!

57:59.280 --> 58:03.763
So, I bid thee farewell, sweet Sandins.

58:04.520 --> 58:07.922
Release the beast, boys.
Let the killing commence!

58:16.120 --> 58:17.406
Run!

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:39.970
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:42.122
Are you hurt?
No, I'm okay.

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:44.090
We've got to get out of here.

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:45.571
Come on, come on, come on.

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:37.167
Cooper, come
look at little lady Sandin.

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:40.687
She's exquisite.

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:43.523
Save her for me.

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:48.085
Dad.

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:50.806
Are you okay?
Yes, Dad, I'm okay.

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:52.120
You stay here, okay?

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:53.440
Are Mommy and Zoey okay?

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.170
Yeah, they're gonna be fine.

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.251
Mmm...

01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:55.321
Shit.

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:11.606
Shit!

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:09.682
It's okay.

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:13.645
It's okay.

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:17.484
Your soul has been
cleansed, Mr. Sandin.

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:19.289
You've Purged.

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:22.290
Just one question for you.

01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:25.081
Was his life
really worth yours?

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:29.964
Your family's?

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:36.529
Thank you for this unforgettable
Purge, Mr. Sandin.

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:20.441
No! No! No!

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:23.966
Get off!
Get off of me!

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:25.484
James!

01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:29.889
Let go of me!
Please, don't!

01:08:30.279 --> 01:08:32.760
Please don't kill me.
Please don't!

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:34.645
James!

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:35.960
Please, don't!
Please, don't!

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.087
Please!

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:38.680
James!

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:40.321
James!

01:08:40.399 --> 01:08:42.050
Please!
Please, don't!

01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:43.689
Don't! Please don't!

01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:30.411
James.

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:34.165
James.

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:37.524
Charlie! Charlie!

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:39.090
Zoey!

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:44.290
Dad!

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:47.410
Sorry.

01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:57.290
Thank you for your sacrifice.

01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:01.001
You got a lot
of heart, Mr. Sandin.

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:03.804
Blessed be America...

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:08.366
A nation reborn.

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:32.924
I'm so sorry.

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:18.770
Thank you.

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.761
We saw that you were
having some trouble.

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:23.530
We decided to help you.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.207
You saved us.
I don't know what to say.

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:35.207
Don't thank us too much, Mary.

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:39.521
The truth is, you're
ours, not theirs.

01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:41.970
What do you mean "ours"?

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:43.680
What do you mean?
What do you mean "ours"?

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:45.081
Dad?

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:46.400
No, no, no!
Dad!

01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:48.281
Wait! Wait!

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:49.361
Dad!

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:53.971
James is dead.

01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:56.529
Mary and the kids
will have to do.

01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:59.285
Let's tie them up. We'll
kill them right here.

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:01.921
No, no, no.
What do you mean?

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.365
Wait! Wait! Wait!

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:04.965
Come on.
No! No!

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:06.121
No!

01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:08.288
No! No! No!

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:10.044
Mom! Mom!

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:13.046
Cali, get the tape!

01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:16.848
Don't touch
my fucking children!

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:18.763
Don't you touch
my fucking kids!

01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:22.840
Let them go!
Let them go!

01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:25.685
Right now! You let
my fucking kids go!

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:27.762
Shut up, Mary!
Shut up!

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:29.001
Right now!

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:30.320
Mary! Shut up!

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:34.605
I swear to God, I will
shoot him right now.

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:36.926
Do you hear me?

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:48.285
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:49.646
Why are you doing
this right now?

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:51.531
When your barricades came down,

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:55.969
we saw an opportunity to cleanse
ourselves of our hatred.

01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:57.849
You made so much
money off of us

01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:00.491
and then you just
stuck it in our faces.

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:03.487
You all think
you're so damn perfect.

01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:07.443
I just need you
to listen to me, Grace.

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:08.885
I'm really begging
you right now.

01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:10.928
Do not do this to
my children, please.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.764
They're my children, please.

01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:14.604
Please, not my children.

01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:17.160
I can't let you do that.

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:20.883
We have to, Mary. That's what
this night is all about.

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:24.846
I am begging you.
I'm really begging you.

01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:27.850
I can't let you do this.

01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:32.369
We'll be better people and you'll
have sacrificed yourselves

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:34.329
to make the world
a better place.

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:35.640
Mom...

01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:36.927
Mom!

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.729
You're frightening them.

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:40.930
Please don't.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.650
Please let me hold my children.

01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:45.291
Mary, no, no.
It's over.

01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:46.486
Untie them.
It's over.

01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:48.483
Please untie my hands.
Hmm?

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:50.566
Grace?

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:52.649
It's time for you
to quiet down, Mary,

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:55.200
and let us do
our duty as Americans.

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:02.321
Mom.

01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:08.083
Sweetheart...

01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:12.047
Zoey, look at me, okay?
Just look at your mama.

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:14.043
Just look at me.
Just look at me.

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:17.442
Blessed be
the New Founding Fathers

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:21.411
for letting us Purge
and cleanse our souls.

01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:22.970
Blessed be America...

01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:32.890
Blessed be America,
a nation reborn.

01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:35.129
I'll go first and then...

01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:36.970
We'll take turns.

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:43.801
Timmy?

01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:53.730
Don't move.

01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:57.803
Drop your weapons right now.

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:00.050
Untie them, let's go.

01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:01.281
Right now.

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:20.570
Your call.

01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:29.209
Just get it over with.

01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:31.649
Kill us quickly.

01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:35.046
No.

01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:37.482
Oh, for God's sake!
Just do it!

01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:39.244
Come on!

01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:42.366
Mom, they were going to kill us.

01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:43.965
It doesn't matter.

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:48.485
We are gonna play the rest of this
night out in motherfucking peace.

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:52.401
Does anyone have
a problem with that?

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:39.331
Did you enjoy
Grace's Purge party...

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:42.203
Mr. Halverson?

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:44.806
Go fuck yourself.

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:46.689
Sorry, I can't hear you.

01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:51.602
It was very nice.

01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:52.920
Oh, good.

01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:56.447
I'm glad you all
had a grand time.

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:20.007
Didn't you hear what I said?
No more killing tonight!

01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:23.371
Is it that hard to understand?

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:39.648
Oh, my...

01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:47.485
Now get the hell
out of my house.

01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:10.327
Wait.

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:17.963
Are you going to be okay?

01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:22.564
Thank you.

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:28.930
Good luck.

01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:21.365
<i>Just
after 7:00 AM, March 22nd,</i>

01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:24.171
<i>the Annual Purge
has just concluded.</i>

01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:27.090
<i>This is your American
morning news program.</i>

01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:29.527
<i>And reports are coming in
from all around the country</i>

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:32.763
<i>as police, firefighters
and paramedics...</i>

01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:35.730
<i>The New Founding Fathers
have released an early statement saying</i>

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:38.280
<i>this was the most
successful Purge yet.</i>

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:39.691
<i>I am walking...</i>

01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:43.003
<i>I should say "stumbling"
through downtown Los Angeles,</i>

01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:46.050
<i>and there are literally
bodies everywhere.</i>

01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:47.565
<i>I witnessed
a group of young men</i>

01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:48.880
<i>breaking into
the tenement next to me,</i>

01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:50.803
<i>and they were
dragging people out</i>

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:53.360
<i>and just executing
them on the street.</i>

01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:55.761
<i>Hundreds
have gathered in Times Square</i>

01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:57.126
<i>for a public vigil</i>

01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:59.567
<i>thanking all those
who were killed last night</i>

01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:03.361
<i>for their sacrifice to make
this country a safer place.</i>

01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:05.044
<i>They are turning people away</i>

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:06.963
<i>from emergency rooms
in Brownsville</i>

01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:09.486
<i>as there is simply
no more room.</i>

01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:10.971
<i>The markets
were up this morning</i>

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:13.566
<i>as both gun and
home security system</i>

01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:15.529
<i>quarterly sales
reports were released</i>

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:17.841
<i>announcing profits
in both sectors.</i>

01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:21.811
<i>We have 364
long days until the next Purge.</i>

01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:25.163
<i>So let's get all our Purge
talk and analysis in today</i>

01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:27.242
<i>while our thoughts
are still fresh.</i>

01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:31.325
<i>From what I've been reading, it seems
like Dallas had the most participants.</i>

01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:34.404
<i>I did get a chance to see some
live surveillance footage</i>

01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:36.482
<i>out of Dallas, Forest Lawn,</i>

01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:39.410
<i>and there had to be 200
people in the town square</i>

01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:41.045
<i>Purging at the same time.</i>

01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:43.168
<i>Never saw anything like this.</i>

01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:45.761
<i>I lost my two sons last night.</i>

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:47.365
<i>My boys.</i>

01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:49.681
<i>Yeah, I was a proud American.</i>

01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:51.000
<i>Not anymore.</i>

01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:54.004
<i>This country has taken
everything from me.</i>
