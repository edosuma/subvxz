01:49.068 --> 01:50.111
No!

01:54.324 --> 01:56.451
I pushed him.

01:56.534 --> 01:59.412
- No, wait! Wait!
- I did it. I did it.

01:59.496 --> 02:03.374
Listen to me. You did not push him.
And you did not push him.

02:03.458 --> 02:06.711
No one did this. Nobody.

02:08.755 --> 02:10.715
Call an ambulance!

02:20.225 --> 02:22.143
What the fuck!

02:39.202 --> 02:41.704
- You're a cop?
- No, I'm not a cop.

02:41.788 --> 02:43.998
- Well, what the fuck were you doing there?
- I was...

02:44.082 --> 02:45.750
- Bonnie saw you.
- Do you wanna come in?

02:49.045 --> 02:49.921
I can explain.

02:50.004 --> 02:52.590
- Yeah, you better fucking explain.
- Okay, um...

02:54.008 --> 02:56.719
I was called in for questioning.

02:56.803 --> 02:58.304
More like ordered.

02:58.388 --> 02:59.305
By who?

02:59.389 --> 03:00.723
Um...

03:00.807 --> 03:03.476
- Detective Quinlan.
- What did she say?

03:03.560 --> 03:05.937
She asked me about us and you

03:06.020 --> 03:10.608
and she asked whether you had talked
to me about Perry Wright's death.

03:12.861 --> 03:13.945
What did you tell her?

03:14.028 --> 03:16.406
I told her the truth,
that you didn't tell me anything.

03:17.574 --> 03:19.701
But, Jane, she knows
your history with this guy.

03:19.784 --> 03:22.495
She knows he raped you,
she knows he's Ziggy's dad,

03:22.579 --> 03:25.123
and she clearly doesn't think he slipped.

03:27.500 --> 03:32.130
She said with five witnesses,
the odds are in her favor,

03:32.213 --> 03:34.966
one of you will finally crack.

03:35.049 --> 03:38.887
The first one who does gets a break.
The other four are fucked.

03:44.517 --> 03:46.185
<i>He went to, uh...</i>

03:47.478 --> 03:50.815
<i>To kick me again and...</i>

03:50.899 --> 03:56.487
<i>And I think that's when he...
He must have taken a step back, and he fell.</i>

03:58.990 --> 04:02.201
<i>I don't really remember
because he stumbled back.</i>

04:03.578 --> 04:07.582
<i>And that must have been when he fell.</i>

04:13.004 --> 04:16.048
<i>Is there anything else
that you would like to add?</i>

04:21.346 --> 04:22.722
<i>I feel, um...</i>

04:28.186 --> 04:29.604
<i>I just feel like...</i>

04:31.397 --> 04:36.986
<i>I don't have a proper memory
of everything,</i>

04:37.070 --> 04:40.365
<i>so that's why it's a little inconsistent.</i>

04:44.077 --> 04:45.662
But we're not gonna break. Right?

04:45.745 --> 04:46.621
- No. Right.
- Yeah.

04:46.704 --> 04:49.415
Okay, we're gonna keep our poise
and we're gonna stay calm...

04:49.499 --> 04:52.877
Jesus Christ, a meteor could hit
and you would say, "Stay calm."

04:52.961 --> 04:56.130
Oh, fuck off, Bonnie. You know what?
I'm so tired of taking care of you

04:56.214 --> 04:57.840
- and your feelings.
- Oh, my God.

04:57.924 --> 05:00.969
I know your mom had a stroke,
but you're the one who pushed him.

05:01.052 --> 05:02.303
What the fuck you say to me?

05:02.387 --> 05:03.888
- He slipped.
- Oh, my God.

05:03.972 --> 05:05.556
- No one pushed anybody.
- All right.

05:05.640 --> 05:07.767
- He slipped.
- Come on. Bonnie.

05:08.685 --> 05:10.895
- He slipped, right? Right?
- He slipped. Right.

05:10.979 --> 05:12.563
Right. Yeah.

05:12.647 --> 05:15.316
- All right, let's go home. Come on.
- It's all right.

05:15.400 --> 05:16.400
Jesus.

05:17.610 --> 05:19.696
And so I started to run at him.

05:23.116 --> 05:24.993
And the closer I got to him,

05:26.828 --> 05:28.871
the more I knew what I had to do.

05:39.132 --> 05:40.842
You're still here, huh?

05:40.925 --> 05:44.220
Yeah, I left and came back.

05:44.303 --> 05:47.098
Doctor's gonna be here shortly
with an update.

05:58.651 --> 05:59.736
You ready?

06:03.990 --> 06:04.991
Because I'm not.

06:08.661 --> 06:10.955
She's too damn young, for God's sake.

06:20.757 --> 06:22.258
You're gonna fight this.

06:23.760 --> 06:27.055
You hear me, baby?
You're gonna fight this.

06:46.324 --> 06:47.366
What did you say?

06:47.450 --> 06:50.745
Something in the vein of "Fuck off."

06:50.828 --> 06:52.914
I know it was rude.

06:52.997 --> 06:55.541
I feel bad. I just...

06:56.793 --> 06:58.961
Why were you all out there?

06:59.045 --> 07:01.798
This secret last-minute meeting.

07:01.881 --> 07:07.220
Were you helping Celeste
prepare for her custody battle? Like...

07:07.303 --> 07:10.890
Um, no, we were just being there for her,
you know.

07:10.973 --> 07:13.518
- And at night?
- Solidarity. Yeah.

07:13.601 --> 07:18.856
And during all this solidarity,
is that when "fuck off" came up, or...?

07:20.399 --> 07:21.399
Mm-hm.

07:25.071 --> 07:28.658
You know, the other day, when you talked
about hating yourself, there was honesty.

07:28.741 --> 07:31.452
I mean, it gave me hope.

07:31.536 --> 07:34.914
First time in a long time,
the air felt clear.

07:34.997 --> 07:38.918
But right now,
it seems like the window is fogging up,

07:39.001 --> 07:40.586
like you're hiding again.

07:55.935 --> 07:57.228
- Mom?
- Hey.

07:58.354 --> 07:59.647
It's cold.

08:01.315 --> 08:02.315
Come here.

08:08.030 --> 08:10.116
- You couldn't sleep?
- No.

08:14.912 --> 08:17.373
He knows that I am
lying about something.

08:17.456 --> 08:18.958
We made a pact.

08:19.041 --> 08:20.585
He's my husband.

08:20.668 --> 08:23.296
It's a fucking pact, Madeline.

08:23.379 --> 08:25.548
You don't tell anybody that.

08:25.631 --> 08:28.759
I mean, you're the one that says
Ed's all about truth and honesty.

08:28.843 --> 08:30.469
- He is.
- Oh, great.

08:30.553 --> 08:33.722
So suppose he leads with that?
Are you kidding me?

08:33.806 --> 08:36.142
Then we're fucked,
and Celeste is fucked first.

08:36.225 --> 08:37.559
She'll lose her kids.

08:39.729 --> 08:42.148
You cannot tell him that.

08:48.070 --> 08:48.988
Yeah, it's not...

08:49.071 --> 08:51.574
Hey, Kristen.
Uh, we have a seafood watch question.

08:51.657 --> 08:54.785
The mom with the penguin kid
with the penguin hat.

08:54.869 --> 08:55.912
You got it. Yeah.

08:59.081 --> 09:02.376
So you're not gonna return my calls or
texts because I talked to the police?

09:02.460 --> 09:05.004
No, it has nothing to do with the police.

09:05.087 --> 09:07.590
I just can't do this right now.

09:12.011 --> 09:14.096
Hey, who wants to touch
something prickly?

09:14.180 --> 09:17.433
- Me.
- Okay. She's just to my left.

09:19.060 --> 09:21.812
I'm just kidding. No, I'm kidding.
We have slimy kelp here.

10:21.122 --> 10:25.293
I just want you to know how sorry I am
that it's come to this.

10:25.376 --> 10:29.422
But at the end of the day,
we are still family, you know?

10:29.505 --> 10:31.632
We're not family, Mary Louise.

10:34.135 --> 10:35.428
All rise.

10:40.266 --> 10:42.018
- Be seated.
- Okay.

10:43.394 --> 10:45.980
I have before me the psychiatric reports,

10:46.063 --> 10:49.191
together with the finding
of the child psychologist.

10:49.275 --> 10:50.901
I am not satisfied.

10:52.111 --> 10:56.449
As I stated at the outset,
the court takes these matters seriously.

10:56.532 --> 10:58.784
As both a judge and a mother,

10:58.868 --> 11:02.997
I'm ill-inclined to remove these children
from the only home they've ever known.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.874
That said, I do have concerns.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.253
Both parties will be provided
copies of the reports today,

11:09.337 --> 11:12.590
which I would like to enter into evidence
by joint stipulation.

11:12.673 --> 11:16.802
Given the underlying neutrality of these
recommendations, I anticipate no objection.

11:18.846 --> 11:22.183
All right. We will proceed
with the evidentiary hearing tomorrow.

11:22.266 --> 11:24.894
Mrs. Wright?
I wish to first hear from you.

11:24.977 --> 11:27.521
You will take the stand
and entertain questions from me

11:27.605 --> 11:29.648
as well as the petitioner's counsel.

11:29.732 --> 11:32.151
Your Honor,
I'd like to conduct a direct first.

11:32.234 --> 11:35.905
Not necessary. You can redirect
after, should you feel the need.

11:35.988 --> 11:39.367
Okay? See you all back here tomorrow.

11:42.078 --> 11:44.413
Hey. No, come on.

11:44.497 --> 11:47.583
We expected this. Come on. Come on.

11:51.212 --> 11:54.006
- Are the boys gonna have to be here?
- Not for tomorrow, no.

11:56.258 --> 11:59.887
Celeste.
There is the risk she could get full custody.

11:59.970 --> 12:01.514
I'm not settling.

12:01.597 --> 12:03.349
I am not settling.

12:04.600 --> 12:07.019
- Okay.
- And don't try to handle me here.

12:08.187 --> 12:11.315
- All right? Don't do that.
- Handle, no.

12:11.399 --> 12:12.733
Advise, yes.

12:14.402 --> 12:17.988
Farber's goal
will be to make you look erratic.

12:18.072 --> 12:21.867
I can protect you some,
you just can't look like you need protection.

12:21.951 --> 12:25.704
- Do you understand what I'm telling you?
- Yeah, of course. I'm on my own.

12:25.788 --> 12:28.082
- That's what you're saying.
- You are not on your own.

12:28.165 --> 12:29.792
But we need to be careful.

12:31.293 --> 12:32.293
Get some rest.

12:38.217 --> 12:40.136
There's nothing more we can do.

12:41.303 --> 12:44.473
I'm afraid we just have to watch and wait.

12:44.557 --> 12:46.183
Do you have any questions?

12:50.312 --> 12:51.814
Can we kill her?

12:51.897 --> 12:54.358
- Bonnie.
- She doesn't wanna exist like this.

12:54.442 --> 12:56.068
We can't kill her.

12:56.152 --> 13:00.197
I know it's done.
Pain management, we give her morphine.

13:00.281 --> 13:03.534
That isn't the kind of pain we manage.

13:03.617 --> 13:05.327
Morphine is not indicated here.

13:07.413 --> 13:08.456
You'd do it for a dog.

13:08.539 --> 13:09.832
- Bonnie.
- What?

13:09.915 --> 13:10.915
Enough.

13:16.547 --> 13:18.215
<i>Oh, it's a total nightmare.</i>

13:18.299 --> 13:20.384
The hearing is open to the public?

13:20.468 --> 13:23.304
No, Judge Marilyn Cipriani.

13:23.387 --> 13:25.723
I wish I knew somebody
who knew somebody who knew her.

13:28.100 --> 13:31.353
I, uh, said goodbye to Amabella.

13:31.437 --> 13:33.314
Oh, Juliette...

13:33.397 --> 13:35.858
I kind of told her that
I might be coming back,

13:35.941 --> 13:38.402
you know, to soften the goodbye.

13:38.486 --> 13:41.197
That was such a good idea. I know, it's...

13:41.280 --> 13:44.492
Um, my... My lawyer said
I need to talk to you

13:44.575 --> 13:49.205
- about the severance again.
- Oh, honey, I know... We know we owe it.

13:49.288 --> 13:53.501
But now, it's...
It's in the bankruptcy trustee's hands.

13:53.584 --> 13:56.629
So first things first,
we need to find you a new job.

13:56.712 --> 13:59.006
Right,
you got our letter of recommendation?

13:59.089 --> 14:01.926
- Yeah, I did. Thank you.
- Yep, sure. Of course.

14:03.093 --> 14:05.846
- So I guess this is goodbye.
- Mm.

14:05.930 --> 14:07.181
Mm-mm.

14:09.642 --> 14:13.187
Let's not. No, it's not goodbye here.

14:13.270 --> 14:18.817
Because we will rise up,
and when we do, we will hire you back.

14:18.901 --> 14:20.528
- Okay.
- Okay?

14:20.611 --> 14:21.862
Okay.

14:21.946 --> 14:24.615
Oh, I couldn't have done this
without you, Juliette.

14:27.326 --> 14:28.326
Yeah!

14:29.703 --> 14:31.789
Yeah, baby!

14:33.958 --> 14:35.584
- Good job, buddy.
- That was awesome.

14:35.668 --> 14:38.003
Good job, high-five.

14:38.087 --> 14:39.463
Oh, my God.

14:39.547 --> 14:40.881
That was so cool.

14:40.965 --> 14:42.091
I love that.

14:43.634 --> 14:46.929
- Hey.
- What are you not doing in school?

14:47.012 --> 14:50.307
- You're not suspended again, I hope.
- No, it's a parent-teacher conference.

14:50.391 --> 14:53.435
Oh, cool. Well, you...
I saw you catch that wave.

14:53.519 --> 14:55.521
You got it down.
You don't need my help, huh?

14:55.604 --> 14:57.982
No, I still need your help.
I'm not that good.

14:58.065 --> 15:00.317
She's been teaching me. Again.

15:01.360 --> 15:03.612
- Both of you guys are so good at this.
- Hey, baby.

15:03.696 --> 15:05.906
Do you wanna just build a sandcastle
for a minute?

15:05.990 --> 15:08.325
- Give us a second to talk?
- Okay.

15:08.409 --> 15:10.202
- Thank you.
- You guys wanna talk private.

15:10.286 --> 15:12.871
- Yeah. Will you take a board? Thank you.
- All right.

15:12.955 --> 15:14.540
- Make sure you got a moat
- Over here.

15:14.623 --> 15:16.663
- to keep the people out.
- Your toys are over here.

15:19.378 --> 15:20.378
- Hi.
- Hey.

15:23.173 --> 15:25.050
So you're gonna freeze me out forever?

15:26.176 --> 15:30.389
It's gonna take me a long time
to let someone in again.

15:33.517 --> 15:34.685
I'm not walking away.

15:35.769 --> 15:37.354
Mom, check this out.

15:44.361 --> 15:46.447
- Bonnie, I...
- Metal in the pocket.

15:46.530 --> 15:51.619
Look, I wanna apologize for the other day.
I was completely out of line.

15:51.702 --> 15:54.788
Thanks. It's fine. We're going through
a lot of stuff, you know.

15:54.872 --> 15:58.500
No, everything your mom is going through,
I had no right to speak to you like that.

15:58.584 --> 16:02.421
And I want you to know if I can be helpful,
which I...

16:02.504 --> 16:05.758
- I don't know how I could, but I wanna be.
- Thank you.

16:07.593 --> 16:08.593
You okay?

16:09.595 --> 16:14.725
Yeah, I'm good. Like what you said,
everyone's going through stuff, and I...

16:15.893 --> 16:18.854
- I'm no exception.
- It's getting to you, isn't it?

16:18.937 --> 16:19.937
What?

16:21.565 --> 16:22.816
It's getting to you.

16:24.068 --> 16:26.779
Every time. Every time.
I know how you feel.

16:26.862 --> 16:28.530
It's like they put us on a list.

16:29.823 --> 16:33.327
Please raise your right hand.
Do you swear to tell the truth,

16:33.410 --> 16:36.497
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

16:36.580 --> 16:38.540
- I do.
- Please be seated.

16:40.542 --> 16:42.711
- Mr. Farber.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

16:45.005 --> 16:46.173
The whole truth...

16:47.758 --> 16:49.718
and nothing but the truth.

16:49.802 --> 16:52.971
Do you have any questions concerning
the oath you just took, Mrs. Wright?

16:53.055 --> 16:54.848
- None.
- Excellent.

16:54.932 --> 16:57.101
And first off, my sympathies.

16:57.184 --> 16:59.269
Your husband died.

16:59.353 --> 17:01.980
And now this. That can't be easy.

17:02.064 --> 17:04.900
In fact, it's not been easy for a long time,
has it, Mrs. Wright?

17:04.983 --> 17:07.444
You were in an abusive relationship
with your husband.

17:08.945 --> 17:11.448
- Yes.
- Physically abusive.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.617
- Yes.
- Emotionally abusive.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.078
- Yes.
- He hit you.

17:17.788 --> 17:20.415
- Many times.
- Did you ever hit him?

17:21.250 --> 17:24.712
I mean, sometimes I would fight back.

17:24.795 --> 17:26.547
Did you ever hit him first?

17:29.967 --> 17:31.343
It happened, but...

17:33.011 --> 17:35.180
I mean, more typically,
he attacked me.

17:35.264 --> 17:38.642
That must have been terrifying.
Was it ever thrilling?

17:41.186 --> 17:42.186
Thrilling?

17:42.646 --> 17:44.648
Did the physical violence
ever lead to sex?

17:44.732 --> 17:46.191
Objection.

17:46.275 --> 17:47.526
Overruled.

17:48.569 --> 17:53.115
Did the physical violence ever occasion
you and your late husband to have sex?

17:54.658 --> 17:56.535
- Yes.
- Great sex?

17:59.288 --> 18:03.333
- You were aroused by the violence.
- I was not aroused by the violence.

18:03.417 --> 18:04.668
You never said that?

18:04.752 --> 18:06.837
That the incendiary exchanges
with your husband,

18:06.920 --> 18:10.549
including the physical violence
led to gratifying and passionate sex,

18:10.632 --> 18:11.759
did you ever say that?

18:13.844 --> 18:18.432
My relationship with my husband
was very complicated.

18:18.515 --> 18:20.350
Complicated.

18:20.434 --> 18:22.269
Was it sick?

18:22.352 --> 18:24.521
- It was not healthy.
- Are you over your sickness?

18:24.605 --> 18:27.357
- Objection.
- Sustained.

18:27.441 --> 18:29.109
Did you miss the violence?

18:30.611 --> 18:31.862
No, I do not.

18:31.945 --> 18:37.993
I... I miss my husband,
but I don't miss getting beat up.

18:38.076 --> 18:39.203
So...

18:39.286 --> 18:43.290
- So he beat you up often?
- He did.

18:44.541 --> 18:46.418
Did you ever call the police?

18:49.213 --> 18:50.839
- No.
- Never?

18:50.923 --> 18:53.842
- Did you ever tell anybody?
- No.

18:53.926 --> 18:58.096
You never told anybody
that your husband was hurting you?

18:58.180 --> 19:00.974
- I told my therapist.
- Are you healed now?

19:01.058 --> 19:02.851
- Objection.
- Sustained.

19:12.361 --> 19:14.279
Do you, uh, recognize this man?

19:23.747 --> 19:25.624
- Yes.
- What's his name?

19:26.667 --> 19:29.545
- I don't know.
- Oh, not even a first name?

19:29.628 --> 19:32.256
Um... Jeff.

19:32.339 --> 19:35.592
Uh, Joe. Joe. It was Joe. I... I think.

19:35.676 --> 19:38.262
Did you have sexual
relationships with Joe?

19:41.473 --> 19:44.059
Um, I'd... I'd had a bit to drink.

19:44.142 --> 19:47.479
So approximately how long after
you met Joe did the two of you have sex?

19:47.563 --> 19:49.648
- Objection.
- Not long enough to get his name.

19:49.731 --> 19:51.400
- Objection.
- Counsel.

19:51.483 --> 19:54.319
Did this also get violent?

19:56.655 --> 19:57.865
It was physical.

19:59.700 --> 20:01.368
And are you really over your sickness?

20:01.451 --> 20:03.579
- Objection.
- Sustained.

20:06.415 --> 20:08.041
Do you recognize this man?

20:16.592 --> 20:18.468
Michael Something.

20:18.552 --> 20:20.804
Did you have sex
with Michael Something?

20:20.888 --> 20:23.348
My social life is not... I mean, this is...

20:23.432 --> 20:25.434
Did you have sex
with Michael Something?

20:25.517 --> 20:26.852
Yes.

20:26.935 --> 20:28.478
And it also got physical?

20:29.605 --> 20:30.606
Um...

20:32.107 --> 20:34.610
If anything, I was the aggressor.

20:34.693 --> 20:38.363
Oh, so where did this aggressive sex
take place?

20:40.324 --> 20:41.992
In a bathroom.

20:42.075 --> 20:45.287
- A bathroom stall? A public bathroom stall?
- Yes. Yes.

20:45.370 --> 20:47.205
How long after you
met Michael Something

20:47.289 --> 20:49.917
did you have aggressive sex
in a public bathroom stall?

20:50.000 --> 20:52.544
- Objection.
- Sustained.

20:52.628 --> 20:54.796
In the interest of time, just...

20:58.759 --> 20:59.759
And...

21:01.178 --> 21:02.930
No, this...

21:03.013 --> 21:04.097
Please.

21:04.181 --> 21:06.350
Did you have sexual relations
with all these men?

21:06.433 --> 21:11.813
Listen, this has nothing to do with
my capacity to parent my children. This...

21:11.897 --> 21:13.815
Did your children ever meet
any of these men,

21:13.899 --> 21:16.193
these sexual one-offs,
your boys ever meet them?

21:21.198 --> 21:23.867
They... They met Joe.

21:23.951 --> 21:25.202
No others?

21:25.869 --> 21:27.496
Um, no.

21:28.622 --> 21:32.042
Did you ever bring any of these men
home when the boys were there?

21:33.126 --> 21:35.087
No. Um...

21:37.464 --> 21:38.340
Well, once.

21:38.423 --> 21:43.220
Once, I did, but, um, he was gone.
He was gone before they woke up, so...

21:43.303 --> 21:47.099
So if Josh were to tell his grandmother,
"I tried to get into bed with Mommy,

21:47.182 --> 21:49.226
but there was a stranger there,"
he'd be lying?

21:51.144 --> 21:53.730
If he said, "I tried to wake Mommy up,
but I couldn't,

21:53.814 --> 21:57.484
and the stranger told me to go back to my
room," that would just be his imagination?

22:00.904 --> 22:02.030
Oh.

22:02.114 --> 22:05.826
I mean, sometimes I, um,
have trouble sleeping,

22:05.909 --> 22:08.203
and so I take Ambien, and that...

22:09.788 --> 22:12.874
Have you ever driven while on Ambien
and run off the side of a road?

22:15.669 --> 22:16.837
Um...

22:21.299 --> 22:22.801
Your Honor, um...

22:24.219 --> 22:26.346
- Your Honor.
- Answer me, please. Answer to me.

22:26.430 --> 22:28.807
No, I would...
I would like to address the court.

22:28.890 --> 22:30.642
- Go ahead.
- Um...

22:30.726 --> 22:31.935
I have...

22:34.479 --> 22:37.190
I drove off the road once.

22:37.274 --> 22:38.650
I've struggled.

22:38.734 --> 22:41.653
I've had difficulty
in the wake of my husband's death,

22:41.737 --> 22:44.614
and I've engaged in... In...

22:44.698 --> 22:49.119
In self-destructive
behavior, including, um...

22:52.039 --> 22:56.126
- Including sexual encounters and...
- Celeste.

22:56.209 --> 22:57.878
Please, let me, I'm...

22:58.503 --> 23:00.005
I'm not gonna look you in the eye

23:00.088 --> 23:03.175
and say that I'm healed,
but I will say this:

23:03.258 --> 23:05.969
I am in the process of healing, and...

23:12.059 --> 23:14.436
And through it all,
I've always been a good mother.

23:14.519 --> 23:17.355
I've always put
my children's interests first,

23:17.439 --> 23:21.985
and I've always, always kept them safe,
even when...

23:23.070 --> 23:25.030
Perry... Even when...

23:26.198 --> 23:29.034
there was a monster in the house.

23:29.117 --> 23:31.745
Have you ever been violent
with your children, Mrs. Wright?

23:36.583 --> 23:39.961
I overreacted on two occasions.

23:42.297 --> 23:44.049
You ever strike your mother-in-law?

23:47.135 --> 23:48.887
I slapped her in the face.

23:48.970 --> 23:51.515
Ever push your husband
down a flight of stairs?

23:51.598 --> 23:53.183
No!

23:53.266 --> 23:55.143
And how dare you?

23:55.227 --> 23:56.812
How dare you?

23:59.940 --> 24:02.609
This is a computer simulation
of your husband's fatal fall.

24:02.692 --> 24:04.444
Objection. Relevance,

24:04.528 --> 24:06.863
- not to mention unfair surprise.
- Take a de bene.

24:06.947 --> 24:10.617
- This is off-the-charts prejudicial.
- This isn't a jury trial, counsel,

24:10.700 --> 24:12.994
I'll give you time to impeach if you want.

24:13.078 --> 24:15.372
This is where your husband
would have landed

24:15.455 --> 24:17.666
from a natural fall.

24:17.749 --> 24:19.167
Now, this is where he did land.

24:22.254 --> 24:23.588
Oh...

24:23.713 --> 24:24.713
This is...

24:26.466 --> 24:27.634
Mm.

24:29.219 --> 24:31.388
The physics say

24:31.471 --> 24:33.807
that for him to have landed there,

24:33.890 --> 24:36.143
he must have been pushed.

24:36.226 --> 24:38.937
So I dare to ask...

24:40.480 --> 24:41.815
did you push him?

24:41.898 --> 24:43.859
No. I did not.

24:45.402 --> 24:47.237
How did he fall?

24:47.320 --> 24:49.865
He lost his balance and he slipped.

24:49.948 --> 24:53.952
He lost his balance
immediately after you found out

24:54.035 --> 24:57.873
he'd been unfaithful with another woman
who bore his child?

24:57.956 --> 24:59.916
- Not relevant.
- Not relevant?

25:00.000 --> 25:02.294
- She might commit a homicide, but hey.
- Objection.

25:02.377 --> 25:05.922
All right, the objection
on relevance is sustained.

25:06.006 --> 25:09.050
Thank you, Your Honor.
I have no further questions. Thank you.

25:12.721 --> 25:14.514
Okay.

25:14.598 --> 25:15.682
Shit.

25:17.058 --> 25:20.437
God, Katie,
you couldn't have cut any of that off?

25:20.520 --> 25:23.857
- Jesus Christ.
- Oh, my God, she was having me followed.

25:23.940 --> 25:25.609
- She was having me followed.
- I know.

25:25.692 --> 25:28.987
- Unbelievable.
- She had PIs on me. God.

25:29.070 --> 25:30.322
This is just...

25:31.865 --> 25:34.284
Okay, that was rougher than we thought.

25:34.367 --> 25:35.994
You think?

25:36.077 --> 25:37.077
Jesus Christ.

25:37.120 --> 25:39.414
I'll need to put you
back on the stand.

25:39.497 --> 25:41.333
- No...
- I need to rehabilitate you.

25:41.416 --> 25:43.084
Deconstruct a lot of what just happened.

25:43.168 --> 25:45.837
I don't think I can
get back in that chair.

25:45.921 --> 25:50.926
I'm sorry, but I think you have to.
You can't leave it like that. You can't.

25:51.009 --> 25:54.638
And you've been through so much, honey,
but you have to fight for those boys.

25:54.721 --> 25:56.264
You can't leave it like that.

25:56.348 --> 25:58.350
<i>I dare to ask,</i>

25:58.433 --> 26:01.853
did you ever push your husband
down a flight of stairs?

26:01.937 --> 26:04.522
- I did.
- You have to fight for them.

26:04.606 --> 26:05.899
They need you.

26:31.007 --> 26:33.426
Well, I must say I was surprised
to hear from you.

26:36.346 --> 26:39.474
I have no intention
of doing anything, okay?

26:40.934 --> 26:41.934
Okay.

26:42.852 --> 26:46.064
All right, part of me does want
to do something,

26:46.147 --> 26:51.069
but I've already done it,
just by entertaining the idea even...

26:52.112 --> 26:54.823
for a few minutes, I've done it.

26:54.906 --> 26:57.617
Look, let me tell you
what my shrink told me.

26:59.119 --> 27:02.414
It's not about inflicting payback
on your cheating spouse.

27:02.497 --> 27:07.335
It's about getting a sense
that you didn't just take it.

27:07.419 --> 27:09.212
You didn't just swallow your pride

27:09.296 --> 27:12.257
and resign yourself
to being some wimpy ass victim.

27:12.340 --> 27:14.342
But you are looking for payback.

27:14.426 --> 27:17.429
True. I'd like both
Joseph and Madeline to pay.

27:17.512 --> 27:19.764
But I'm also attracted to you.

27:25.312 --> 27:28.481
I keep both a masturbation diary
and a bucket list.

27:28.565 --> 27:31.151
- Lower your...
- You made both.

27:31.234 --> 27:33.528
It's not just about me getting even.

27:33.611 --> 27:36.323
It's about me getting you.

27:36.406 --> 27:37.699
I want you.

27:41.911 --> 27:43.079
Don't overthink it.

27:44.914 --> 27:46.499
We have sex.

27:46.583 --> 27:48.543
We'll probably love it.

27:48.626 --> 27:51.046
If we don't, we move on.

27:52.589 --> 27:54.466
Of course, if we do love it...

27:56.217 --> 27:58.094
we do it again.

27:58.178 --> 27:59.429
And again.

28:00.805 --> 28:01.805
Jesus.

28:16.404 --> 28:20.325
<i>♪ All the joy came over me ♪</i>

28:21.576 --> 28:23.787
<i>♪ When you came into my life ♪</i>

28:24.829 --> 28:27.832
<i>♪ Sweet love that you bring me ♪</i>

28:28.625 --> 28:31.211
<i>♪ Cutting my darkness like a knife ♪</i>

28:35.382 --> 28:37.634
Ed, I'm at a loss.

28:37.717 --> 28:42.055
I just hope I can convince you
that I'm incapable

28:42.138 --> 28:43.515
of doing something...

28:44.849 --> 28:46.393
that I already did.

28:47.435 --> 28:48.435
I just...

28:49.771 --> 28:53.149
I hope I can earn back your trust.

28:53.233 --> 28:57.153
Madeline, there's nothing I want more
than to trust you.

28:59.489 --> 29:02.700
And that said, I can't just wave a wand.

29:04.035 --> 29:05.120
Neither can you.

29:25.390 --> 29:26.433
What are you doing?

29:26.516 --> 29:28.726
You know she's a good mother.
Call this off.

29:28.810 --> 29:30.228
Oh, I know.

29:31.729 --> 29:35.066
I thought about doing exactly that.
I really did.

29:36.109 --> 29:37.193
But then, I...

29:39.279 --> 29:41.281
I considered the boys and...

29:41.364 --> 29:44.367
She's not well. Clearly, you can see that.

29:44.451 --> 29:48.121
No, what I see is a woman
who's struggling. Who isn't?

29:49.998 --> 29:51.666
Are you struggling, Jane?

29:53.501 --> 29:54.919
With your conscience, perhaps?

29:58.089 --> 30:00.258
Ziggy told me you purchased a gun.

30:00.341 --> 30:03.136
Did you plan to use it on my son?

30:03.219 --> 30:06.264
Did you move to Monterey
to hunt him down?

30:07.599 --> 30:10.477
Actually, I came to Monterey
in search of a good man.

30:10.560 --> 30:14.022
A good man who happened
to have a bad night. Do you know

30:14.105 --> 30:16.649
the difficulty that my son
is gonna have to face

30:16.733 --> 30:20.570
being a product of rape
because of your fucking son?

30:20.653 --> 30:22.780
He was not a good man!

30:22.864 --> 30:24.949
Yeah, maybe I would have
fucking shot him.

30:25.033 --> 30:27.035
I didn't get the fucking chance!

30:29.537 --> 30:31.456
- Good night.
- Good night.

30:31.539 --> 30:32.749
Good night, babies.

31:23.299 --> 31:25.093
Sounds like somebody's having a party.

31:27.428 --> 31:29.681
Uh, you go ahead
and put your mom's food on the counter.

31:29.764 --> 31:31.266
I'll tell her it's here.

31:31.349 --> 31:32.349
Okay.

31:50.910 --> 31:51.911
I...

31:52.954 --> 31:54.372
I can explain.

31:54.455 --> 31:56.791
I was just cleaning out my closet,

31:56.874 --> 32:00.044
you know, and I found my wedding dress
in the back.

32:00.128 --> 32:02.589
Just kind of reminded me
of a certain time

32:02.672 --> 32:04.924
when I was a different person and...

32:05.967 --> 32:08.344
I was so sure that I was gonna be...

32:09.721 --> 32:10.597
a great wife.

32:10.680 --> 32:12.974
Anyway, this is where it gets stupid,

32:13.057 --> 32:15.518
- so brace yourself for this part.
- Okay.

32:15.602 --> 32:18.896
I put on the veil
and then tried to put on the dress,

32:18.980 --> 32:21.941
but it doesn't fit,
but we're not talking about that,

32:22.025 --> 32:23.192
uh...

32:23.276 --> 32:25.737
just so I could reconnect
to that person, and then...

32:26.821 --> 32:28.364
I put on this song because...

32:30.158 --> 32:33.870
Because you picked this song
for our wedding

32:33.953 --> 32:35.747
and it always makes me dance.

32:38.249 --> 32:40.627
So that's, uh, pretty much it.

32:40.710 --> 32:42.337
Now you're up to speed.

32:43.921 --> 32:45.590
And I'm also out of breath.

32:53.139 --> 32:57.518
Well, like I said before,
you can't just wave a wand.

33:01.314 --> 33:03.399
But that was pretty fucking close.

33:36.849 --> 33:38.851
Go towards the light, baby.

33:48.319 --> 33:49.946
Any change?

33:50.029 --> 33:51.114
Uh-uh. None.

we gotta go.

34:11.050 --> 34:12.969
Come here, sweetie. Hi.

34:14.512 --> 34:17.431

35:32.298 --> 35:34.509
I wanna go back to yesterday,

35:34.592 --> 35:37.470
when counsel asked you
about the other men.

35:38.596 --> 35:42.266
I have to admit,
we were all a bit thrown by it.

35:42.350 --> 35:43.935
- I was thrown.
- Hmm.

35:44.936 --> 35:49.232
I mean, I'm clearly still struggling.

35:49.315 --> 35:51.734
Are you getting professional help?

35:51.818 --> 35:55.488
Yes. Yes, I am,
and I've stopped taking the Ambien.

35:55.571 --> 35:56.697
And the other?

35:58.199 --> 36:01.202
Are we dealing with some kind
of sexual addiction here?

36:01.285 --> 36:04.121
No, there's no sexual addiction.

36:04.205 --> 36:07.583
Mrs. Wright, something seems
to be going on here.

36:07.667 --> 36:09.168
These encounters...

36:10.419 --> 36:12.922
- Are you getting help for this?
- I will.

36:13.005 --> 36:14.924
- You will?
- Yes.

36:15.007 --> 36:16.217
Why haven't you?

36:17.385 --> 36:20.513
I think I've been too ashamed.

36:20.596 --> 36:22.640
To tell your therapist, even?

36:22.723 --> 36:24.684
Especially my therapist.

36:24.767 --> 36:25.810
Why is that?

36:25.893 --> 36:28.187
Because she's worked so hard
on me, and...

36:30.273 --> 36:31.482
I think I just...

36:32.608 --> 36:37.071
I desperately wanted to see myself
through her eyes and see progress.

36:37.154 --> 36:41.492
It seems like risky behavior.
How am I to trust that this will stop?

36:41.576 --> 36:42.994
Because it will stop.

36:43.911 --> 36:45.246
It will.

36:45.329 --> 36:46.455
It has stopped.

36:49.500 --> 36:51.961
All right, I have to be honest here.

36:53.004 --> 36:55.089
It gives me pause.

36:55.172 --> 36:58.467
I need you to explain to me,
as best you can,

36:58.551 --> 37:00.386
what you think is going on here.

37:01.470 --> 37:03.806
I wanted to be touched. I wanted it...

37:04.849 --> 37:08.227
I wanted it to be uncomplicated,

37:08.311 --> 37:11.564
and I wanted to be in control, so...

37:11.647 --> 37:16.402
And as it was said yesterday,
um, the violence with Perry...

37:18.404 --> 37:22.283
would sometimes lead to sex,
which would...

37:22.366 --> 37:24.577
I mean, it's... It's just...

37:26.287 --> 37:28.205
It's confusing, so...

37:29.290 --> 37:31.042
I think that's...

37:31.125 --> 37:33.210
And it... It sickens me.

37:34.253 --> 37:37.048
And so that's why I was engaging
with the others, because I...

37:37.131 --> 37:40.593
These other men, because I think
I wanted to be free of Perry,

37:40.676 --> 37:42.887
and I wanna push him out.

37:42.970 --> 37:45.681
- "Him" being your husband?
- Yes. Yes.

37:45.765 --> 37:48.059
Were you maybe looking
to hurt yourself?

37:48.142 --> 37:50.478
No, I really don't think
I was doing that.

37:50.561 --> 37:52.605
I think I just wanted to push him out.

37:55.149 --> 37:57.485
Well, I am all too familiar that...

37:58.778 --> 38:00.947
many women stay with their abusers.

38:01.030 --> 38:02.031
Mm-hm.

38:02.114 --> 38:03.616
Tell me why you stayed.

38:09.205 --> 38:10.831
Um, because...

38:16.045 --> 38:19.131
I loved him, and I thought... And... But I...

38:20.716 --> 38:22.885
I just always thought
he would get better.

38:24.220 --> 38:26.097
- But he didn't.
- No, he didn't.

38:28.265 --> 38:30.476
And when I was happy,
I stayed because I was happy

38:30.559 --> 38:35.356
and when I was depressed,
I stayed because I was depressed.

38:36.607 --> 38:38.484
I mean, either way, I was afraid

38:38.567 --> 38:42.154
if I left him of what he might do.
I was afraid how he would react.

38:42.238 --> 38:44.532
I was afraid of being alone. I was...

38:44.615 --> 38:46.951
So I stayed. I stayed to survive.

38:47.034 --> 38:49.328
I stayed for my boys.

38:54.667 --> 38:56.293
Yeah. I'm good.

38:58.421 --> 38:59.714
Mr. Farber.

38:59.797 --> 39:00.797
Thank you.

39:06.095 --> 39:08.639
I dare to ask...

39:14.395 --> 39:15.938
I'm right here, Mama.

39:18.691 --> 39:19.734
Can you see me?

39:25.531 --> 39:26.531
How you doing?

40:02.818 --> 40:04.695
Well, it looks like it's time.

40:06.989 --> 40:10.451
I have to confess something
that I'm not so proud of.

40:10.534 --> 40:12.161
And as I was writing...

40:14.288 --> 40:17.291
I realized I needed
to confess to you first.

40:20.711 --> 40:22.254
So here it goes.

40:25.674 --> 40:26.926
I resent you...

40:27.968 --> 40:30.221
for the childhood I had.

40:30.304 --> 40:32.515
I resent you for your impatience...

40:34.183 --> 40:37.561
for being scared of doing my homework
without being yelled at...

40:39.563 --> 40:42.483
for all the kitchen cabinet doors
you slammed...

40:44.735 --> 40:45.736
for slapping me,

40:47.571 --> 40:49.115
for all the bruises.

40:50.866 --> 40:53.410
I resent you
for not feeling safe at home.

40:54.537 --> 40:57.039
I resent you for being ashamed of me.

41:01.168 --> 41:03.629
I resent you for all the
sex I started to have

41:03.712 --> 41:04.712
when I was 13

41:04.755 --> 41:07.299
to prove to myself that I could be loved.

41:12.221 --> 41:15.933
I resent you for my wanting
to beat the shit out of everyone.

41:18.644 --> 41:21.772
I resent you for making me feel
so fucking worthless

41:21.856 --> 41:23.774
that I settled for a man that I don't...

41:31.490 --> 41:32.741
But mainly...

41:34.535 --> 41:36.078
I resent you...

41:37.872 --> 41:39.582
for killing a man.

41:42.042 --> 41:44.378
I killed Celeste's husband,

41:44.461 --> 41:45.838
and he didn't slip.

41:47.131 --> 41:48.340
I pushed him.

41:51.177 --> 41:53.012
I snapped, and...

41:54.471 --> 41:56.682
when I lunged at him,

41:56.765 --> 41:59.059
I... I was pushing you.

42:04.023 --> 42:06.358
And that push was a long time coming.

42:10.404 --> 42:12.156
And I wanna forgive you.

42:29.715 --> 42:33.135
There was an incident
where a little girl was being bullied,

42:33.219 --> 42:34.929
<i>bitten, choked.</i>

42:35.012 --> 42:36.430
<i>The bully was your son.</i>

42:39.475 --> 42:41.477
My sons are good boys.

42:41.560 --> 42:43.646
So given your struggles,
why not let them stay

42:43.729 --> 42:45.940
with their grandmother while you heal?

42:46.023 --> 42:47.650
I am their mother.

42:47.733 --> 42:49.443
And they belong with me.

42:55.783 --> 42:57.660
- Robert Johannsson.
- Yeah.

42:57.743 --> 42:59.662
And this was for a model train?

42:59.745 --> 43:02.122
A Lionel Union Pacific Car.

43:02.206 --> 43:03.791
It's, uh, vintage.

43:03.874 --> 43:07.503
Stated value is $2200.
Probably worth closer to 3000.

43:07.586 --> 43:08.754
Duly noted.

43:09.880 --> 43:11.006
Marshall Brickman.

43:12.299 --> 43:13.801
No Marshall Brickman?

43:13.884 --> 43:15.636
All right, Juliette Dubois.

43:17.680 --> 43:21.392
And you're seeking severance
in the amount of $72,000?

43:21.475 --> 43:24.061
Yes, sir.
I worked there for six years.

43:24.144 --> 43:27.648
Okay.
And what is this "other" listed?

43:27.731 --> 43:29.441
Hundred and sixty thousand dollars?

43:29.525 --> 43:32.236
That's for other services rendered,

43:32.319 --> 43:35.864
for which I was promised
to be taken care of.

43:35.948 --> 43:37.992
And what other services?

43:38.909 --> 43:42.037
Uh... Stress management.

43:42.121 --> 43:44.164
Can you be more specific?

43:44.248 --> 43:46.834
I just like to leave it at that if I could.

43:51.297 --> 43:53.215
<i>I still love you. You know that, right?</i>

43:53.299 --> 43:55.801
Shut the fuck up

43:55.884 --> 44:00.681
for the rest
of your fucked-up fucking life.

44:00.764 --> 44:02.558
Do you hear me?

44:02.641 --> 44:06.437
I don't wanna hear one fucking word

44:06.520 --> 44:11.317
from your fucked-up
little fucking twerp mouth

44:11.400 --> 44:13.110
on why you fucked up,

44:13.193 --> 44:18.282
no matter what fucked-up excuse
you come up with.

44:18.365 --> 44:21.785
You fucking... Fuck! Shit!

44:21.869 --> 44:23.412
Fuckhead!

44:24.872 --> 44:26.540
The fucking nanny?

44:34.590 --> 44:36.258
All rise.

44:42.222 --> 44:43.222
Be seated.

44:44.850 --> 44:47.603
As I said, I find the psychiatric reports

44:47.686 --> 44:49.730
and the custody evals a bit of a wash,

44:49.813 --> 44:54.234
but I think I have a pretty good grasp
of what we're dealing with here.

44:54.318 --> 44:57.029
And I'm prepared to enter my finding
at this time.

44:58.072 --> 44:59.198
In the case...

45:00.240 --> 45:03.118
- Mrs. Wright.
- I would like to call a witness.

45:04.703 --> 45:07.414
I don't think a character witness
would carry much weight...

45:07.498 --> 45:09.500
This is not a character witness.

45:09.583 --> 45:13.337
You've been asked to decide
where my boys would be better off.

45:13.420 --> 45:17.257
That puts in question
the petitioner's fitness as well.

45:17.341 --> 45:19.134
I was examined. She should be too.

45:19.218 --> 45:22.638
There has been no suggestion
that my client's parental capacity

45:22.721 --> 45:25.391
- is up for review.
- I'm making that suggestion now.

45:25.474 --> 45:27.226
I was fair game. So is she.

45:28.352 --> 45:32.731
All right. We will schedule
the petitioner's testimony for Tuesday.

45:32.815 --> 45:36.318
And with the court's permission,
I would like to question her myself.

45:37.528 --> 45:39.196
I don't think that's wise.

45:39.279 --> 45:41.532
I'm an attorney.
I have a current bar license.

45:41.615 --> 45:43.659
I'm entitled to participate
in my own defense.

45:45.077 --> 45:48.539
That may very well be true,
but I don't think it's in your best interest.

45:48.622 --> 45:52.126
It's my fight, Your Honor.
I ask that you let me wage it.

45:54.044 --> 45:55.254
Very well.

45:55.337 --> 45:56.672
Tuesday at 1:00.

45:56.755 --> 45:58.632
