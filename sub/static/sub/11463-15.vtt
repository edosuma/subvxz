00:58.349 --> 00:59.634
No...

01:13.031 --> 01:14.441
Hurry, hurry!
Open the door!

01:14.574 --> 01:16.360
Unlock the door!
Unlock the door!

01:16.493 --> 01:17.482
Oscar!

01:21.456 --> 01:23.412
Travis.

01:23.541 --> 01:25.077
Travis.

01:29.589 --> 01:31.250
Baby, talk to me, please.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.918
- Travis.
- Get him out of here! Tie him up! - You!

01:38.306 --> 01:39.671
Wait!

01:39.808 --> 01:42.174
Wait a second! Wait.
Elena, wait!

01:42.310 --> 01:44.676
Elena, Elena.

01:44.979 --> 01:46.719
Careful!
Watch the blood.

01:47.065 --> 01:49.351
Okay, Oscar, Oscar!

01:51.486 --> 01:53.351
- Elena, just let me talk to him.
- Is she crazy?

01:53.488 --> 01:55.979
- Please. Please. - He killed two
people. He hurt one of our own.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.232
- Where are you taking him?
- Somewhere safe.

01:58.368 --> 02:00.529
We'll take care of Oscar, then we'll
figure out what to do with your husband.

02:00.662 --> 02:02.198
- He just lost his son
- Madison, they don't care.

02:02.330 --> 02:03.285
He didn't know
what he was doing.

02:03.414 --> 02:04.699
Madison,
they don't care.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.573
You're not helping.

02:14.717 --> 02:16.503
Give me your knife.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.594
Madison.

03:52.482 --> 03:53.471
Hold still.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.856
It's getting worse.

03:57.904 --> 03:59.110
I '/I die.

04:01.157 --> 04:02.613
They should never see you like this.

04:13.211 --> 04:15.372
Luciana... What are you doing?

04:15.546 --> 04:17.377
- I'm making you presentable.
- No.

04:18.007 --> 04:20.339
Do you know what happens
when they ﬁnd out?

04:20.510 --> 04:23.252
They'll lose something that is
worth more than their lives.

04:23.429 --> 04:24.885
They'll lose their faith.

04:27.058 --> 04:28.889
And we 7/ die like animals.

04:29.060 --> 04:32.018
We 7/ die anyway.

04:32.855 --> 04:35.562
Did you think this day
would never come?

04:36.693 --> 04:38.775
This the only home we have.

04:40.738 --> 04:43.730
Behind this walls lies nothing
but death and more death.

04:43.741 --> 04:45.117
Behind this walls lies nothing
but death and more death.

04:48.204 --> 04:51.241
/ did everything / could
to keep us together.

04:52.792 --> 04:54.498
/ tried to save us.

04:55.086 --> 04:56.417
You failed.

05:02.927 --> 05:03.916
Nick is right.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.386
The end is near.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.093
Not for us.

05:11.394 --> 05:13.055
Just for you.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.516
Lie to them once more
before you'll leave forever.

05:29.829 --> 05:30.944
lt's ill-timed, Madison.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.115
You cannot speak
for Travis.

05:32.248 --> 05:33.363
- He's family.
- He failed you.

05:33.499 --> 05:34.705
- He compromised us.
- Bullshit.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.040
We were compromised
before Travis got here.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.204
lfl hadn't lit
the goddamn beacon,

05:37.337 --> 05:38.793
none of this
would have happened.

05:38.921 --> 05:40.331
- It's on me.
- Argue for him, it hurts us.

05:40.465 --> 05:41.671
Think about that.
Think about Alicia.

05:41.799 --> 05:44.336
I fought for Elena before.
I can talk to her.

05:44.469 --> 05:46.380
- |'|| convince her.
- Convince her of what?

05:46.512 --> 05:48.173
He's lost too much
to deserve this, Victor.

05:48.306 --> 05:50.046
They can'tjust keep him
locked up like that.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.299
Locked up? Madison,
they're going to exile him.

05:52.435 --> 05:54.096
- Then we'll stop them.
- It was your decree.

05:54.228 --> 05:55.354
What are you going to say
to dissuade them?

05:55.480 --> 05:56.811
What are you gonna do?

06:00.651 --> 06:01.936
What are we gonna do?

06:02.070 --> 06:03.731
We've done as much
bad as good here.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.649
- We've lost our place.
- We earn it back

06:05.782 --> 06:06.897
by not fighting
for Travis.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.273
But he found us.

06:08.409 --> 06:11.321
With all of this,
he found us.

06:11.454 --> 06:13.194
That has to matter.
We can't ignore it.

06:13.331 --> 06:15.743
Madison, I'm sorry,
but the man cannot stay.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.794
You're right.
You're right.

06:24.675 --> 06:26.506
He can't stay.

06:31.766 --> 06:34.553
We can leave with him.
We can go together.

06:34.685 --> 06:36.516
Oh, for Christ's sakes.

06:36.646 --> 06:38.807
- No, Alicia...
- Mom, we can't kick him out.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.726
We can't let that be
who we are.

06:40.858 --> 06:42.234
I won't do that to you.

06:42.360 --> 06:43.725
You don't have a choice.

06:43.861 --> 06:45.692
You're not gonna let Travis
die out there alone

06:45.822 --> 06:46.982
because you're
scared for me.

06:47.115 --> 06:48.104
We're past that.

06:50.660 --> 06:54.619
Look, we found this place.
We'll find another.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.661
Mom, we've lost too many.

07:07.468 --> 07:09.333
Are you really
gonnaleave

07:09.470 --> 07:11.256
for the man
who abandoned you?

07:15.268 --> 07:17.099
Come with us, Victor.

07:19.897 --> 07:22.809
I had the chance
to kill myself.

07:22.942 --> 07:25.354
I chose not to.

07:25.486 --> 07:27.693
I wouldn't die for him,

07:27.822 --> 07:30.689
and I'm not dying
for any of you.

07:44.714 --> 07:46.045
- What?
- How's Oscar?

07:46.174 --> 07:48.005
- Unconscious.
- Andres is working on him.

07:49.385 --> 07:50.750
We're sorry.

07:50.887 --> 07:53.594
Yeah, now.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.088
What do you want?

07:55.224 --> 07:57.260
- Travis did violence.
- He is a monster.

07:57.393 --> 07:58.633
- So he has to leave.
- Your rule.

07:58.769 --> 08:00.976
Yes, but you don't
have to force him out.

08:01.105 --> 08:02.811
We'll go.

08:02.940 --> 08:05.022
All of us.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.733
Give us till morning,
you'll never see us again.

08:14.702 --> 08:15.691
Alright.

08:18.539 --> 08:19.528
- Give him to us now.
- To hell with 'em/

08:21.751 --> 08:24.242
You don't have to hold him
if we're leaving.

08:24.378 --> 08:26.630
What's the point?
He's not gonna hurt anyone.

08:26.756 --> 08:27.996
The damage
is already done.

08:28.132 --> 08:29.247
He won't do anything.
I'll see to it.

08:29.383 --> 08:31.635
Hector, calm down!
She fought for us.

08:31.802 --> 08:33.338
We can do this for her.

08:36.432 --> 08:37.933
- Let her in.
- But if..

08:38.100 --> 08:39.135
Enough.

08:40.061 --> 08:41.676
Enough blood has been shed.

08:43.981 --> 08:45.937
You leave at dawn.

08:51.072 --> 08:52.733
Check on Oscar.
If anything goes sideways,

08:52.865 --> 08:54.071
we should know.

09:16.138 --> 09:17.969
I told them you
had to leave the hotel.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.267
And I told them
we'd go with you.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.886
- No.
- No other choice.

09:26.816 --> 09:29.307
- It's done. - Nothing's done, Maddy.
You can't do this.

09:29.443 --> 09:31.183
I'm not sending you
out there to die.

09:32.822 --> 09:36.155
You wonder why you found us?
How you found us?

09:36.284 --> 09:37.820
This is why.

09:37.952 --> 09:40.568
But you're both
safe here.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.201
We're leaving
in the morning.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.375
Door's open.

09:51.507 --> 09:53.839
Wanna wait the night out alone
or with your family?

10:25.875 --> 10:28.491
You've got ﬁve minutes.
And bring him something to eat.

10:28.669 --> 10:29.533
Thank you.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.120
Luciana.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.168
lthought
you were gone.

10:37.887 --> 10:39.673
Please don't do this.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.511
Come with me.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.131
And where shall we go?

10:44.852 --> 10:46.308
This is how
it is now, okay?

10:46.437 --> 10:47.643
You find
somewhere safe,

10:47.772 --> 10:49.683
and when it's compromised,
you move on.

10:49.815 --> 10:51.521
If we leave, you know
what's gonna happen?

10:51.651 --> 10:53.607
We'll watch each other
die and turn

10:53.736 --> 10:55.692
until there's
no one left to watch.

10:58.908 --> 11:02.651
But they're gonna
slaughter you all anyway.

11:02.787 --> 11:05.153
Somewhere
you must know I'm right.

11:06.499 --> 11:09.206
We're gonna
meet our fate.

11:09.335 --> 11:11.826
This is no place
for boys.

11:11.962 --> 11:14.954
Do what you do, Nick.
Run.

11:31.774 --> 11:34.561
And res?

11:34.694 --> 11:37.060
You shouldn't be here.

11:37.196 --> 11:38.561
I want to help.

11:38.698 --> 11:39.938
There's nothing
you can do.

11:40.074 --> 11:42.190
Has he come to yet?

11:43.744 --> 11:45.359
No.

11:54.213 --> 11:56.204
His pupils
are dilated.

11:56.340 --> 11:57.750
I think
his brain's swelling.

11:57.883 --> 12:00.295
l have to remove
a piece of his skull.

12:01.679 --> 12:03.920
Relieve the pressure.
I have no choice.

12:05.266 --> 12:06.802
I can't lose my brother.

12:07.268 --> 12:08.348
What does she want here?

12:08.728 --> 12:09.934
I wanna help.

12:10.062 --> 12:11.393
You wanna speak
for your family.

12:11.522 --> 12:13.513
There's no excuse
for what he did, I know that.

12:13.649 --> 12:15.856
- I'm not pretending... - If it were
up to me, he'd be gone already.

12:15.985 --> 12:19.694
- I'd put him out myself.
- Hector... that's enough.

12:22.241 --> 12:23.697
Alicia, go.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.906
Now, go.

12:33.502 --> 12:35.038
Hold him.

13:31.769 --> 13:35.227
Dear brothers and sisters!

13:37.858 --> 13:41.146
You can 't imagine
how happy I am

13:41.320 --> 13:42.685
to see yOU 0/706 more.

13:45.950 --> 13:47.656
The rumors you heard

13:50.079 --> 13:51.114
are true.

13:54.583 --> 13:55.618
The y'll come,

13:58.337 --> 13:59.918
the men with guns.

14:02.424 --> 14:05.382
We think they'll arrive this night

14:07.972 --> 14:09.382
to kill us.

14:10.224 --> 14:11.430
To chase us away.

14:12.935 --> 14:15.722
Us and our brothers and sisters.

14:17.773 --> 14:20.640
It's the evil in man that seeks for us.

14:22.111 --> 14:25.854
The same evil the world is cleaning
itself from right now.

14:28.868 --> 14:29.903
But now,

14:31.579 --> 14:32.785
more than ever,

14:35.040 --> 14:36.541
we shall not fear.

14:38.836 --> 14:40.792
Now, more than ever,

14:40.963 --> 14:42.703
our faith will give us strength.

14:50.431 --> 14:51.841
This is neither the end

14:53.517 --> 14:55.223
nor is the end near.

14:55.394 --> 14:58.761
We will not die today...
or tomorrow.

14:59.857 --> 15:01.597
Another destiny awaits us.

15:02.359 --> 15:04.099
Gods glory awaits us.

15:04.695 --> 15:06.356
We're immune to death.

15:06.530 --> 15:08.441
We'll overcome the evil.

15:09.408 --> 15:11.239
We 7/ defend our home.

15:11.410 --> 15:15.153
And together
we '/I sun/ive El Pon/enir.

15:17.958 --> 15:20.950
Because we 've got something
that is stronger

15:20.961 --> 15:21.996
Because we 've got something
that is stronger

15:22.171 --> 15:24.457
than weapons or the evil.

15:27.968 --> 15:29.583
We've got our faith.

15:30.930 --> 15:34.013
And we 've got ourselves.

15:39.939 --> 15:40.974
Be prepared.

15:42.691 --> 15:45.182
Now we have
to defend what is ours.

15:56.997 --> 15:58.157
Holy shit.

16:36.745 --> 16:40.579
You need to know
who you're leaving with, Maddy.

16:40.708 --> 16:42.824
Whoever you think
I am...

16:44.336 --> 16:47.828
whatever part of me
you think is the same,

16:47.965 --> 16:50.297
it's not.

16:50.426 --> 16:52.382
- You think I don't know that?
- I know that.

16:52.511 --> 16:55.093
- Travis...
- I'm not sorry.

16:56.682 --> 16:59.719
You shouldn't be.
They deserved it.

17:07.401 --> 17:09.266
I'm no better,
Travis.

17:12.573 --> 17:14.109
I'm worse.

17:19.121 --> 17:22.113
You killed, yes.

17:24.001 --> 17:25.616
So have I.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.666
Celia.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.171
| locked her in
with her dead.

17:37.431 --> 17:38.762
To protect Nick.

17:45.397 --> 17:48.104
I know the world changed you
and made you this.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.690
Me, I've been
like this a long time.

17:54.490 --> 17:57.152
I understand
what you did,

17:57.284 --> 17:59.149
why you did it.

18:01.622 --> 18:03.487
And I'll understand
when you do it again,

18:03.624 --> 18:06.206
because you will.

18:06.335 --> 18:07.871
You'll have to.

18:12.049 --> 18:14.415
We will have to.

18:18.222 --> 18:22.010
And I can face that
if you're with me.

18:27.356 --> 18:29.017
I'm here.

18:53.590 --> 18:54.875
That is just not right.

18:55.050 --> 18:58.042
They lie safely
in their beds up there.

18:58.053 --> 18:59.168
They lie safely
in their beds up there.

18:59.346 --> 19:00.176
And we...

19:00.347 --> 19:02.133
- We 've got a deal with them.
- No.

19:03.016 --> 19:04.847
You agreed to this deal.

19:42.973 --> 19:45.134
No, no, not in here.
Don't make them see this.

19:49.771 --> 19:50.806
Stop it!

19:50.939 --> 19:53.271
God damn it, stop it!
We had a deal.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.391
Oscar is dead.

19:55.527 --> 19:57.028
Okay, so let us leave.
We'll go.

19:57.154 --> 19:58.269
Let us go.
We'll go now.

19:58.405 --> 19:59.690
- Come on.
- Stand him up.

19:59.823 --> 20:01.233
- Stand him up!
- Andres, make them let him go.

20:02.367 --> 20:03.823
Kick him out!

20:10.500 --> 20:12.456
Why does he
get to walk away?

20:14.671 --> 20:16.207
Take me out of here,

20:16.340 --> 20:17.876
where they don't
have to see this.

20:21.011 --> 20:22.922
You killed him.

20:25.307 --> 20:27.093
But I had
to cut him open.

20:28.477 --> 20:30.058
I had to end it.

20:30.187 --> 20:31.643
Andres,
put down the gun.

20:31.772 --> 20:34.229
Hector.
Make him stop, Hector.

20:34.274 --> 20:35.605
Eye for an eye...

20:36.068 --> 20:38.901
- Not fair.
- You're right, it's not fair.

20:40.656 --> 20:43.272
Maddy, get out of here.
Take Alicia with you.

20:43.408 --> 20:44.568
No, don't, don't.

20:54.795 --> 20:56.126
Sorry.

20:57.464 --> 20:59.250
No!

20:59.383 --> 21:01.374
Hey!

21:07.975 --> 21:10.466
Everybody out!
All of you.

21:21.446 --> 21:23.482
We need to run, now.

21:25.951 --> 21:26.940
Alicia.

21:28.078 --> 21:30.535
Come on.
Travis, get her.

21:53.395 --> 21:54.430
Victor, come on.

22:02.821 --> 22:04.231
We need to go.

22:09.870 --> 22:11.360
Maddy.

22:19.713 --> 22:21.999
- Victor...
- I'll be okay.

22:22.132 --> 22:24.874
Go.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.921
Now.

22:46.990 --> 22:48.696
Hold on.

23:35.747 --> 23:37.703
You'll be okay.

24:13.577 --> 24:14.566
Go away.

24:16.580 --> 24:18.036
Leave me alone!

24:26.715 --> 24:28.330
They told me
you had left.

24:34.556 --> 24:36.421
I saw something
and came back.

24:50.238 --> 24:51.694
Let me help you.

25:07.047 --> 25:08.753
So, you afraid?

25:11.051 --> 25:12.507
Of?

25:14.179 --> 25:15.464
You're dying.

25:18.975 --> 25:21.011
I can still fight.

25:22.437 --> 25:24.428
I can still help.

25:26.858 --> 25:29.270
Be brave,
but careful.

25:30.362 --> 25:31.852
Your words.

25:35.909 --> 25:37.069
If they come here,

25:37.202 --> 25:40.365
and we're still here,
it's over.

25:43.083 --> 25:44.414
You want
to stay and fight,

25:44.543 --> 25:46.909
but it's their lives
you're being brave with.

25:47.045 --> 25:49.582
Yours is already over.

25:51.758 --> 25:53.749
I care about
my people.

25:53.885 --> 25:55.386
Your people?

26:05.021 --> 26:07.603
You wanted
to be a great man.

26:10.110 --> 26:11.941
You still want it.

26:14.281 --> 26:15.942
Who doesn't?

26:16.074 --> 26:19.191
Then let them go.

26:19.327 --> 26:22.239
Give them
permission to run.

26:24.082 --> 26:26.073
Where will they run to?

26:30.005 --> 26:31.290
North.

26:34.884 --> 26:38.297
I saw a helicopter
landing across the border.

26:39.848 --> 26:42.134
Medevac.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.053
It landed in a camp.

26:47.814 --> 26:50.851
Your people
never have to know.

26:50.984 --> 26:52.975
They'll never find out.

26:58.950 --> 27:00.656
If they follow you...

27:02.412 --> 27:04.118
there's a weight that comes.

27:04.247 --> 27:06.488
Luciana and I
will do it together.

27:06.625 --> 27:09.492
- Luciana wants to stay.
- Not for the place.

27:09.628 --> 27:12.620
She wants to stay
for the people and for you.

27:12.756 --> 27:15.964
She doesn't
wanna look at me.

27:16.092 --> 27:19.380
She didn't believe in you
because you were immune.

27:19.512 --> 27:22.299
She believed in you
because you were fearless.

27:22.432 --> 27:24.172
You show her
you're not afraid,

27:24.309 --> 27:27.051
you tell her
it's okay to go, she will listen.

27:27.187 --> 27:30.771
Your people will live,

27:30.899 --> 27:33.641
and...

27:33.777 --> 27:36.769
you get to die
a beautiful death.

27:36.780 --> 27:39.192
you get to die
a beautiful death.

29:13.501 --> 29:15.162
Had to have been
100 people here.

29:27.891 --> 29:30.348
There's an office
upstairs.

29:30.477 --> 29:33.469
The leader was asking
about the colonia and about Nick.

29:33.605 --> 29:35.436
Maybe something
will tell us where they went.

30:22.612 --> 30:24.773
It's the people I saw.

30:24.906 --> 30:27.113
The ones who knew Nick.

30:33.373 --> 30:35.329
Maddy.

30:35.458 --> 30:36.914
Maybe they stayed
in their home when it started.

30:37.043 --> 30:39.705
They might have survived
where they lived.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.248
Shit.

30:53.059 --> 30:54.845
Got an address.

30:54.978 --> 30:56.218
Mom?

31:00.358 --> 31:02.098
Mom.

31:05.071 --> 31:07.062
What are you doing?

32:15.058 --> 32:16.594
Fire!

32:20.980 --> 32:22.060
Stay close!

32:41.793 --> 32:43.033
That is almost too easy.

32:44.379 --> 32:46.870
The gringo listened to me.

32:47.048 --> 32:48.333
They're gone.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.122
They ran away.

34:07.128 --> 34:08.208
They ran away.

34:14.719 --> 34:17.631
Those cowards
ﬂed like cockroaches!

34:19.390 --> 34:20.971
Am I right, guys?

35:00.181 --> 35:01.216
What the hell...

36:01.284 --> 36:02.239
This son of a bitch.

36:23.055 --> 36:24.511
Marco, come on!

37:15.691 --> 37:17.352
Where are we going, Luciana?

37:19.278 --> 37:20.358
Up north.

38:17.712 --> 38:18.827
Go back
and get in the van.

38:18.963 --> 38:20.453
Lock the doors.

38:23.801 --> 38:25.837
We won't be long.
Go.

39:32.620 --> 39:33.985
Oh, Christ.

39:41.253 --> 39:43.118
Everyone's dead.

40:12.326 --> 40:15.910
He's alive...
for now.

40:17.873 --> 40:19.124
He hasn't spoken yet.

40:25.089 --> 40:26.545
We don't have much time.

40:35.141 --> 40:38.133
- An angel...
- I'm looking for my son, Nick.

40:38.144 --> 40:40.180
- An angel...
- I'm looking for my son, Nick.

40:41.981 --> 40:42.970
Are you...

40:44.942 --> 40:47.558
Nick's mother?

40:50.656 --> 40:52.521
You know where he is?

40:52.658 --> 40:54.569
Is he still alive?

40:58.581 --> 41:00.196
Border.

41:04.128 --> 41:06.585
He saw something.

42:35.636 --> 42:36.500
What?

42:36.637 --> 42:39.094
What is it?

42:39.223 --> 42:41.885
Just trying
to get my bearings.

42:47.439 --> 42:49.725
It's some kind
of refugee camp.

42:58.033 --> 43:00.115
A couple hours'
walk, maybe.

43:17.344 --> 43:19.835
Nick!

43:55.007 --> 43:56.838
Boys! We got a bleeder!
