-(screaming)

00:11.167 --> 00:12.967
-* Whatcha want,
whatcha want *

00:13.000 --> 00:15.067

00:15.100 --> 00:18.933

come for you? *
-Stop! Now! Stop!

00:18.967 --> 00:21.033
-(clattering)
-Heads up!

00:21.067 --> 00:23.533
-* Bad boys, bad boys,
whatcha gonna do... *

00:23.567 --> 00:25.967
I smoked some marijuana!
I'm a marijuana smoker!

00:26.000 --> 00:27.833
-* Bad boys, bad boys *
-Crawl out!

00:27.867 --> 00:29.233
* Whatcha gonna do... *

00:29.267 --> 00:30.467
-Hands up! Hands up!

00:30.500 --> 00:32.367
Hold it! Hold it!
Hold it! Hold it!

00:32.400 --> 00:34.433
-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.467 --> 00:36.533
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.567 --> 00:39.100
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:39.133 --> 00:41.300
in a court of law.

00:42.833 --> 00:45.333
-Sometimes it's nice to be
solo in a unit,

00:45.367 --> 00:47.400
but it is good to have
a partner with you,

00:47.433 --> 00:49.033
especially
with the tight-knit squad

00:49.067 --> 00:52.267
that we have,
I can rely on my partner

00:52.300 --> 00:56.067
to back me up on certain
dangerous situations.

00:56.100 --> 01:00.267
And just havin' that extra set
of eyes lookin' for stuff,

01:00.300 --> 01:03.133
that, uh, that definitely
helps us out.

01:03.167 --> 01:05.633
-Is it Brian?

01:05.667 --> 01:09.167
-It is, dude.
He told me he was gonna run
last time, actually.

01:09.200 --> 01:12.300
-We got a guy right here
on a bike that, uh, is known
to us in this neighborhood,

01:12.333 --> 01:15.700
that's got a, uh,
felony warrant, so we're gonna
try and stop and talk to him.

01:15.733 --> 01:17.833
-Stop your bike, dude.

01:17.867 --> 01:19.700
Stop your bike.

01:19.733 --> 01:20.967
-Huh?
-Stop your bike.

01:21.067 --> 01:22.267
-Why?
-Because.

01:22.300 --> 01:24.600
-What did I do?
-Stop your bike.

01:24.633 --> 01:26.233
-(radio chatter)

01:26.267 --> 01:27.767
-Stop.

01:35.467 --> 01:37.100
Get-- Go, go, go, go!

01:39.500 --> 01:44.467
-(radio chatter)

02:11.767 --> 02:15.333
-North 22, he went eastbound
from here, it's Brian.

02:18.133 --> 02:21.333
White male, black shirt,
red tennis shoes.

02:21.367 --> 02:26.567
Looks like he dumped his hat
that he was wearing and ran
eastbound from Sixth and Keim.

02:26.600 --> 02:29.067
-(radio chatter)

02:29.100 --> 02:31.567
-(dog barking)

02:31.600 --> 02:33.633
-Voice on radio:
7-22, okay I've got him
over here.

02:33.667 --> 02:35.167
(indistinct)

02:35.200 --> 02:37.467
Did he have a backpack on?

02:37.500 --> 02:39.867
-Yeah, he had a backpack
with him.

02:39.900 --> 02:43.833
-They got him pinned
in a backyard over here
on the street north of us.

02:43.867 --> 02:46.067
-Voice on radio:
Yeah, that's where he'll
jump out if he's there.

02:46.067 --> 02:49.100
The blue house
is five houses down on Rose.

02:49.133 --> 02:51.800
-Supposedly they say
they have him bunkered down

02:51.833 --> 02:53.667
in this backyard.
-Voice on radio:
Yeah, I've got him

02:53.700 --> 02:56.667
in the house on the corner.
Looks like he's gettin' ready
to go west on fifteenth.

02:56.700 --> 02:58.933
-North.

02:58.967 --> 03:01.867
Hey, he's goin' back northbound
towards Keim.

03:01.900 --> 03:03.633
He's in the, uh, backyard,
it looks like.

03:03.667 --> 03:05.633
-(dog barking)
-He's comin' right here.

03:05.667 --> 03:08.067
-(radio chatter)
-(dogs barking)

03:09.733 --> 03:13.367
-(siren sounding)
-Stop right there.
Stop right there.

03:13.400 --> 03:14.933
He's comin'
into the backyard right here.

03:14.967 --> 03:18.133
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!

03:18.167 --> 03:21.400
-(dogs barking)
-Get your hands
behind your back!

03:21.433 --> 03:23.533
-(radio chatter)
-Don't move!

03:23.567 --> 03:26.167
-(dogs barking)
-Do not move, Brian.

03:26.200 --> 03:29.433
-(dogs barking loudly)
-He's compliant right now.

03:29.467 --> 03:31.900
He just tried breaking
into this house.

03:33.267 --> 03:37.267
-(radio chatter)
-Give me your other hand.

03:38.600 --> 03:40.867
-Why you pull me over, man?
-'Cause you got warrants.

03:40.900 --> 03:42.967
-For what? Ow-ow--
-'Cause you missed court.

03:43.067 --> 03:44.667
Again.
-For what?

03:44.700 --> 03:47.167
-Hey, it's code four.
He's in custody.

03:47.200 --> 03:48.833
Where's your backpack at?

03:48.867 --> 03:53.167
-I don't know.
-At least you held to your word
about runnin', right?

03:53.200 --> 03:55.533
-You guys arrest me
for some stupid (bleep)
every time--

03:55.567 --> 03:57.700
-Dude, you got a felony warrant.
-Felony warrant, for what?

03:57.733 --> 03:59.067
-Yeah, f-- 'cause
you missed court.

03:59.100 --> 04:00.633
I just checked you
the other day.

04:00.667 --> 04:02.200
-Why the (bleep) is it
a felony warrant?

04:02.233 --> 04:03.833
-'Cause you have
open cases on you.

04:03.867 --> 04:05.833
Do you know him?
-No, I don't know him.

04:05.867 --> 04:08.500
-Why'd you run today?
-I told you I was gonna run.

04:08.533 --> 04:10.933
-Where's your backpack at?
-I threw it over there, bro.

04:10.967 --> 04:12.733
-No, y-- you had it on
right here.

04:12.767 --> 04:15.433
-Yeah, I've got it right here.
-You got it? Okay.

04:15.467 --> 04:17.667
-(exhales)
-Could I get some water?

04:17.700 --> 04:19.267
-Yeah, I'll get you
some water, bro.

04:19.300 --> 04:21.100
-It says that I have
a felony warrant, though,
for what?

04:21.133 --> 04:23.200
-It's so new
it's not even in the system.

04:23.233 --> 04:25.067
Would you like to prosecute?
-Oh, yeah.

04:25.067 --> 04:29.700
-Did you hear that?
-(indistinct)

04:29.733 --> 04:32.433
-You-- Yeah, you wanna grab his?
-Yeah, I'll grab
your information.

04:32.467 --> 04:33.800
You the homeowner here, sir?
-Yes, sir.

04:33.833 --> 04:36.300
-Exciting day for you, huh?
-No. But yeah.

04:36.333 --> 04:38.067
-(laughs)

04:38.067 --> 04:40.667
He told me last time.
He told me a couple weeks ago
when I arrested him,

04:40.700 --> 04:42.600
he goes, "I'm gonna run
from you next time."

04:42.633 --> 04:44.200
Okay.
-Okay.

04:44.233 --> 04:47.133
I ran him on Monday,
he had a 51, it was not, uh,
not in the system yet.

04:47.167 --> 04:49.467
-What's his 51 for?
-Dope.

04:49.500 --> 04:54.233
He's got two other open cases.
-Any luck on burglary tools
in there?

04:54.267 --> 04:58.067
Credit cards or more?
-He always has credit cards
on him,

04:58.067 --> 05:00.367
so, I'm sure that's
a bunch of, uh--

05:00.400 --> 05:02.933
-Well, we got-- we got
a burglary detective
here, too, so we can

05:02.967 --> 05:05.700
hand that over and see
if they can link anything up.

05:05.733 --> 05:08.433
-Maybe he'll have
some dope on him today.

05:08.467 --> 05:11.667
He's always good
for paraphernalia
for heroin.

05:12.967 --> 05:15.467
He has some pills
on him today.

05:18.100 --> 05:20.633
-Doin' all right, brother?
You want some water?

05:20.667 --> 05:24.933
-(dog barking)

05:24.967 --> 05:28.367
-So, you're running
'cause you know you had
the warrant, or...

05:28.400 --> 05:30.667
-'Cause they're always
(bleep) with me.
-Okay.

05:30.700 --> 05:32.133
Did you know
you had the warrant out there?

05:32.167 --> 05:35.100
Okay.
I've got a couple more people
that I gotta talk to

05:35.133 --> 05:37.067
in this neighborhood,
'cause during all of that,

05:37.067 --> 05:38.767
you made it
into a lot of backyards.

05:38.800 --> 05:43.067
Somebody said that they thought
you made it inside their house.

05:43.067 --> 05:44.833
-I didn't go in no one's house.
-Okay.

05:44.867 --> 05:47.067
Well, right now,
you're gettin' transported
because of the warrant.

05:47.067 --> 05:48.167
I'll see you down there.

05:49.533 --> 05:52.067
Okay, uh, you're
the homeowner here?
-Yes.

05:52.067 --> 05:53.467
Okay.
Where were you at when
all of a sudden,

05:53.500 --> 05:56.567
all of us were
in your backyard?
Were you up in the side yard,

05:56.600 --> 05:59.133
or--?
-No, I was in my bedroom.
The dogs started barkin'...

05:59.167 --> 06:02.467
-Okay.
-And then, I was just about
ready to grab my .45

06:02.500 --> 06:05.800
when I saw the police officer
go back there, and I went...

06:05.833 --> 06:07.433
what the heck's goin' on?

06:07.467 --> 06:09.667
-Did you know
that he was tryin' to break
into your house?

06:09.700 --> 06:12.900
-Uh-uh. No.
-What would you have done
if you did?

06:12.933 --> 06:14.567
-I would've shot him.
-Okay.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.100
-He'd have been a dead boy.
-(chuckles)

06:16.133 --> 06:18.900
Well, I'm glad we didn't
get to-- that far.
-Yeah, me too.

06:18.933 --> 06:21.800
-Um, is there anything
missing in your backyard
that you know of,

06:21.833 --> 06:23.167
or anything that's--
-Not that I know of.

06:23.200 --> 06:24.967
-Okay.
We're kinda-- to let you
know about him,

06:25.067 --> 06:27.133
he has been somebody
we've been lookin' for
for a little while

06:27.167 --> 06:31.233
in this area.
Um, we originally saw him
about two blocks down,

06:31.267 --> 06:33.333
and he started jumpin'
some fences when we finally
contained him

06:33.367 --> 06:35.333
in your backyard there.
-Okay.

06:35.367 --> 06:38.067
-Um, according
to some other people
and some other witnesses,

06:38.067 --> 06:40.367
the, uh, he was tryin'
to break into the houses,
so I have a feeling

06:40.400 --> 06:43.500
that's what he was trying to do
is come through that back door.
-Oh.

06:43.533 --> 06:46.167
He's the thief that's been
working this area?

06:46.200 --> 06:48.400
-He's been known in this area
for possibly stealin'
some stuff.

06:48.433 --> 06:51.600
He's got some stuff
in his backpack that kind of
leads us to believe

06:51.633 --> 06:54.500
that's where he's at.
He's got a couple of warrants
for things in the past.

06:54.533 --> 06:56.700
And so I appreciate
your cooperation.
-Oh, no problem.

06:56.733 --> 06:58.433
That's-- That is
what you're supposed to do.
-Thanks.

06:58.467 --> 06:59.733
-Thank you.

07:02.433 --> 07:05.067
-Before I worked
in law enforcement, I worked
in the vet industry.

07:05.100 --> 07:09.167
Worked at a couple different
animal hospitals in the city
of Wichita.

07:09.200 --> 07:13.267
My main aspiration
is to become a canine handler

07:13.300 --> 07:17.067
and be able to mesh my knowledge
of canines, and training

07:17.067 --> 07:21.433
and working them in conjunction
with law enforcement.

07:21.467 --> 07:25.267
700, 10-45 at the Motel Six
in Park City.

07:26.933 --> 07:30.333
Okay, so, we're gonna stop them
for tag not assigned.

07:30.367 --> 07:33.967
It's on a white Chevy Cobalt
comin' back to a Blazer.

07:42.967 --> 07:44.700
-What-- What I do wrong?
-Hi, guys.

07:44.733 --> 07:47.867
-What'd I do wrong?
-Well, the reason I stopped you
is when I ran the--

07:47.900 --> 07:51.167
when I ran the check
of the tag, it's comin' back
not to this car.

07:51.200 --> 07:52.967
-It is to this car.
Yes, ma'am, it is.

07:53.067 --> 07:56.333
-Okay. Well--
-This is my grandmother's car.

07:56.367 --> 07:58.067
-Well, again, that's the reason
that I stopped you,

07:58.100 --> 08:00.733
-(laughing)
-is because, based on
when I run the recor--

08:00.767 --> 08:02.800
run the check of the tag,
it's comin' back

08:02.833 --> 08:04.433
to a different vehicle, okay?

08:04.467 --> 08:07.167
It very well could be
a DMV issue, I don't know that.

08:07.200 --> 08:10.700
-Here's the-- I don't know if
that's the current one or not,
but that's the one that proves

08:10.733 --> 08:13.133
that this-- heh!
-Okay.

08:13.167 --> 08:15.133
-(indistinct)
-(chuckles)

08:15.167 --> 08:19.133
-So, I--
-Again, it very well could be
a DMV issue.

08:19.167 --> 08:21.600
I'm just explaining to you
why I stopped you.

08:21.633 --> 08:23.100
-We were just goin'
to get cigarettes.
-Okay.

08:23.133 --> 08:24.600
Do you have
your driver's license on you?

08:24.633 --> 08:26.400
-No, ma'am, I don't
have a-- I don't have
my ID on me, no.

08:26.433 --> 08:29.333
-Okay.
Do you ha-- Do you
have a driver's license?

08:29.367 --> 08:31.433
-No, I don't, because
I'm traveling, I'm not driving.

08:31.467 --> 08:33.167
-Okay.
-Do you have a driver's license?

08:33.200 --> 08:34.967
-Uh, yeah, but I don't
have to give it to you.

08:35.067 --> 08:36.167
'Cause I'm not doing
anything wrong.

08:36.200 --> 08:37.567
-Just give it to her.
Just give it to her.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.133
-I'm not--
-I'm not asking you
to give it to me,

08:39.167 --> 08:40.633
I'm just asking if--
-Yeah, I got my license.

08:40.667 --> 08:43.333
-If you have a license
and you don't, why
are you not driving?

08:43.367 --> 08:46.200
-'Cause-- 'Cause the car's
goin' to (bleep).
-Because-- That's it, I mean--

08:46.233 --> 08:47.733
It's because-- I don't know.

08:47.767 --> 08:50.900
-Okay.
-See, you not havin'
a driver's license,

08:50.933 --> 08:54.700
that's, me maybe
givin' you a ticket,
but with all the-- the attitude

08:54.733 --> 08:56.567
that you guys
are givin' me--
-I'm not tryin' to give you

08:56.600 --> 08:57.733
no attitude, ma'am,
I'm really not.

08:57.767 --> 08:59.467
I'm not.
-Okay.

08:59.500 --> 09:01.700
-I'm probably
goin' to jail.
-What?

09:01.733 --> 09:03.933
-'Cause I think
I might have a warrant.
So I might as well get out

09:03.967 --> 09:06.067
and let you search me
and everything else.
-A warrant for what?

09:06.067 --> 09:07.900
-I don't (bleep) know,
I'm just...
-How do you--?

09:07.933 --> 09:11.533
-(indistinct)
-Why are you gonna get out
of the car if I haven't even

09:11.567 --> 09:13.367
run you for a warrant yet, dude?

09:13.400 --> 09:16.567
-I'm sorry, I just hate--
Look, my-- my issue with cops

09:16.600 --> 09:18.633
is most of the time
they (bleep) with me
for no reason.

09:18.667 --> 09:21.500
I... don't like...

09:21.533 --> 09:23.767
-Why don't you go ahead
and step out for me
for a minute, okay?

09:23.800 --> 09:25.633
-No problem, no problem.
I'm not gonna do nothin' wrong.

09:25.667 --> 09:26.867
-Okay.
You're all right.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.400
-(laughing)
-Hold on, hold on, hold on,
slow down.

09:28.433 --> 09:30.800
-No, I'm not-- Heh-heh.
That's my nephew.
He's--

09:30.833 --> 09:33.600
-Okay.
Why-- Wh-- Why--
Why is he...

09:33.633 --> 09:35.833
so geeked up this way?
-I don't know, he's always--
always this way.

09:35.867 --> 09:39.367
I don't understand it.
I don't-- I try tellin' him,
be cool, be nice, you know?

09:39.400 --> 09:43.900
-Okay, like I said,
th-- this very well is very--
-It has-- I mean, it has to be

09:43.933 --> 09:46.233
a DMV issue, ma'am.
-Once I can run it
through the VIN,

09:46.267 --> 09:48.767
and it could come up
somethin' totally different,
but that is the reason

09:48.800 --> 09:50.633
I stopped you.
-I totally understand.

09:50.667 --> 09:53.767
-Okay, this-- That's the reason
you guys are out of the car
right now is based on--

09:53.800 --> 09:56.200
-I understand that,
I'm not-- that's why I said,
just please don't

09:56.233 --> 09:58.067
take me to jail.
I'll be-- I'll be honest
with you,

09:58.100 --> 10:00.000
my license is suspended.
-Okay.

10:00.000 --> 10:00.067
my license is suspended.
-Okay.
-You know, I mean, just--
-I don't wanna go to jail,
man, I mean, I really don't,

10:00.067 --> 10:03.467
-You know, I mean, just--
-I don't wanna go to jail,
man, I mean, I really don't,

10:03.500 --> 10:05.933
man, I wanna just
get a ticket and go back
to the room, man,

10:05.967 --> 10:07.600
I mean, that's all
I want, man.

10:07.633 --> 10:09.933
-Right, and like I said,
that's why you guys got
pulled out of the vehicle.

10:09.967 --> 10:12.267
It was based on how amped
you're getting right now, okay?

10:12.300 --> 10:14.833
All right.
Well, I'm gonna step back
to my car.

10:14.867 --> 10:18.800
I'm actually gonna have you
step back to the front
of my car right there?

10:18.833 --> 10:21.267
Hang out here for a minute,
I'm gonna check the VIN
on the car and find out

10:21.300 --> 10:22.667
what's goin' on
with the tag, okay?

10:22.700 --> 10:25.633
All right.
Hang tight for a minute.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.733
-Who's car is this?
-It's my grandma's.

10:27.767 --> 10:29.767
-It's your grandma's?
-Yeah.

10:29.800 --> 10:34.600
-Okay.
Passenger's showing he's got
an open citation from 2016,

10:34.633 --> 10:40.533
um, so that very well probably
has been issued a warrant.
Uh, I'm still waitin'

10:40.567 --> 10:43.633
on confirmation.
Once I get confirmation,
if they will extradite

10:43.667 --> 10:46.533
the passenger,
I'll take him into custody
and explain to the driver

10:46.567 --> 10:49.233
about the tag.

10:49.267 --> 10:54.800
Okay. (clears throat)
So, ran it by VIN.
It's DMV issue, okay?

10:54.833 --> 10:57.267
-Okay. No problem.
-So...

10:57.300 --> 10:59.133
just be aware...
-Okay, no problem,
no problem.

10:59.167 --> 11:00.867
-Okay, if you guys
are gonna be drivin'
in the car,

11:00.900 --> 11:05.100
you're gonna get stopped.
Okay? Um, I'm gonna tell you
right now,

11:05.133 --> 11:09.467
if you've got a warrant--
I don't even know if they're
gonna confirm right now, okay?

11:09.500 --> 11:13.133
So don't get yourself
worked up until I find out,
but I'm very upfront

11:13.167 --> 11:15.600
with people.
Um, you were upfront with me,

11:15.633 --> 11:17.633
I'm gonna be upfront
right back with you, okay?

11:17.667 --> 11:20.900
Um, right now I'm waitin'
on confirmation.

11:20.933 --> 11:23.933
-(radio chatter)
-700, go ahead.

11:28.867 --> 11:31.967
10-4, I appreciate it.
All right, they're gonna
confirm, go ahead

11:32.067 --> 11:34.967
and turn around for me, okay?

11:38.200 --> 11:41.100
-I don't want my ma
seein' me.
-No?

11:43.067 --> 11:45.100
All right.
I'm gonna lock these

11:45.133 --> 11:47.967
so they don't tighten up
on you, okay?

11:48.067 --> 11:49.700
You mind transportin'
for me?

11:49.733 --> 11:51.333
I know you don't want
you mom to see you
in cuffs,

11:51.367 --> 11:53.600
but... I don't want you
to get down to the jail

11:53.633 --> 11:56.433
and regret that you didn't
say bye to her, so...

11:56.467 --> 11:59.167
I am more than willing
to drive back to the motel

11:59.200 --> 12:01.367
so you can at least
talk to your mom
real quick, okay?

12:01.400 --> 12:02.833
-You wanna do that?
-Yes.

12:02.867 --> 12:04.267
-Yeah. Okay.
We'll go back there
real quick.

12:04.300 --> 12:06.067
-Yeah.
Are you good with that?
-Yeah.

12:06.067 --> 12:07.467
-Okay.

12:07.500 --> 12:10.133
-All right, I'm gonna
put your seat belt
on you right there.

12:15.400 --> 12:18.067
-We are gonna run back
up here to the Motel Six.

12:18.067 --> 12:23.933
He's calmed down considerably,
so, due to that, um, I'm gonna
allow him to talk to his mother,

12:23.967 --> 12:26.667
um, prior to taking him
down to jail.

12:32.600 --> 12:35.067
-She's in the shower.
-Mom is in the shower?

12:35.067 --> 12:36.600
-Yeah.
-Okay.

12:36.633 --> 12:38.867
-We'll be down there,
do everything we can
to come get you, Brandon.

12:38.900 --> 12:41.900
-Brandon, your mom's
in the shower right now, okay?

12:41.933 --> 12:45.833
So, um, you are gonna
get booked in on that warrant,

12:45.867 --> 12:49.200
but it's better to get it
taken care of now than, say,
get pulled over at Thanksgiving

12:49.233 --> 12:51.367
or somethin', all right?

12:51.400 --> 12:53.533
-Can I give him a hug?
-All right.

12:53.567 --> 12:55.433
He's been cool with me
and I know he's upset.

12:55.467 --> 12:58.967
I think maybe a hug'll--
maybe... calm him down.

12:59.067 --> 13:01.500
-(indistinct) all right?
All right, man.

13:03.800 --> 13:05.533
-All right.

13:05.567 --> 13:06.967
Just make sure
you get that vehicle moved.

13:07.067 --> 13:08.700
-Yeah, I mean, soon
as she gets out
of the shower,

13:08.733 --> 13:10.067
she's gonna go get it, so...
-Okay.

13:10.100 --> 13:12.067
-I mean, if you just
give us that long...
-Absolutely.

13:12.100 --> 13:14.100
Absolutely.
All right.
-All right.

13:14.133 --> 13:15.700
Thank y'all so much.
-You are very welcome.

13:15.733 --> 13:16.767
-Thank y'all.
-Yep.

13:16.800 --> 13:18.100
-Appreciate it.
-I'm a germaphobe, dude.

13:18.133 --> 13:19.433
-Okay.
No problem, no problem!

13:19.467 --> 13:21.133
-Nothing personal,
all right?
-I understand it. (laughs)

13:21.167 --> 13:22.200
-Okay.

13:24.700 --> 13:27.967
-Yeah, when I first started,
we didn't have anybody
in law enforcement

13:28.067 --> 13:30.633
in our family.
And couple years in,

13:30.667 --> 13:32.167
I ended up taking my brother
on a ride along,

13:32.200 --> 13:34.467
and he loved it, he was hooked
from the start.

13:34.500 --> 13:39.067
And uh, he put his application
in, and he's actually
a detective with us now.

13:39.067 --> 13:40.433
It's pretty cool havin'
that connection,

13:40.467 --> 13:44.533
see what other family members
we can recruit to the force.

13:44.567 --> 13:47.833
We had a 15-year-old caller.
He reported that subject
just came up to him

13:47.867 --> 13:52.200
and his friend and pushed
his friend off of his bike
and stole it.

13:52.233 --> 13:54.900
Here's our kids.

13:54.933 --> 13:56.733
He went that way?

13:56.767 --> 13:58.533
-Yeah, he's out here.
-You can see him?

13:58.567 --> 14:00.700
-Yeah, he's down here.
-Can you see him?

14:00.733 --> 14:02.733
-No, I can't see him,
there's too much dust.

14:02.767 --> 14:05.233
-Okay, we'll come around.

14:16.867 --> 14:18.533
Where'd you see him go, man?

14:18.567 --> 14:20.067
-Down there.
He went down there
with his dog.

14:20.100 --> 14:21.233
-Down here?

14:21.267 --> 14:23.767
-Here in the... (indistinct)
-Yeah.

14:23.800 --> 14:25.700
-We were just walkin'
on the levy, and then
he said--

14:25.733 --> 14:27.267
-What's up, man?
We're gonna walk it down here.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.600
-All right.
-What's he wearin'?

14:29.633 --> 14:32.233
-He's wearin' jeans
with a white shirt,
and he has a brown dog with him.

14:32.267 --> 14:34.400
-Okay.
Stay right here.

14:41.733 --> 14:43.533
-Hello, anyone back here?

14:44.733 --> 14:47.067
(whistles)

14:47.100 --> 14:48.533
Stockton police.

14:50.300 --> 14:51.933
-(indistinct)
-Okay.

14:51.967 --> 14:53.533
-My dog back there?

14:56.300 --> 14:57.833
-You back here
with anybody else?

14:57.867 --> 14:59.333
-No, sir.

14:59.367 --> 15:00.600
-Spread your legs out.

15:03.333 --> 15:05.300
I'm just gonna
detain you for right now, okay?
-Yep.

15:05.333 --> 15:07.833
-Is there anyone else
further down here?
-No, sir.

15:07.867 --> 15:09.900
Just my dog
all the way in the back.
-What kinda dog?

15:09.933 --> 15:12.233
-She's a pitbull
and English Mastiff.

15:12.267 --> 15:14.067
-(indistinct)
We got one detained.

15:14.067 --> 15:16.133
-Give me one second,
I'm waiting for my victim,
he's right here.

15:16.167 --> 15:17.600
-Okay.
Where's your camp at, bud?

15:17.633 --> 15:20.133
-In the back.
Little bit farther.

15:20.167 --> 15:21.733
-How many people
camp along here?

15:21.767 --> 15:24.867
-A couple others.
I'm the only one that's
like, permanent, but like,

15:24.900 --> 15:27.400
I don't know people.
I just-- I just now came off
the boat off the water,

15:27.433 --> 15:30.667
and I mean, people come
and go every other day,
you know what I mean?

15:30.700 --> 15:33.833
-Okay.
-Hard tellin'.

15:33.867 --> 15:38.100
Why am I bein' detained?
'Cause we're investigating
a theft of a bicycle.

15:38.133 --> 15:39.833
Did you happen
to take a bicycle?

15:39.867 --> 15:41.700
-No, sir.
-Do you have any bicycles
over here?

15:41.733 --> 15:43.600
-I have a-- a few-- quite a few
bicycles over there.

15:43.633 --> 15:45.500
-Okay.
Let's go down there.

15:45.533 --> 15:48.500
That kid with the white shirt,
have you dealt with him at all?

15:48.533 --> 15:50.200
No, I don't know
who that is.

15:50.233 --> 15:53.067
-So you didn't fight
with that guy or argue
with him, or anything like that?

15:53.067 --> 15:55.833
-No, sir.
-You on probation
or parole, Alex?

15:55.867 --> 15:58.300
-I'm on parole now.
-What for?

15:58.333 --> 16:01.133
-Uh, for petty theft.
-Petty theft? Okay.

16:01.167 --> 16:03.467
Well, where's this kid's
bike at, man?

16:04.967 --> 16:08.067
-Back on the trail.
-How far back?

16:08.067 --> 16:09.200
-About 25 feet.

16:09.233 --> 16:11.067
-Hey, about 25 feet
out that way, he said.

16:11.067 --> 16:12.333
-All right.

16:12.367 --> 16:14.267
-Kid busted my friggin'
window out, man,
on my boat.

16:14.300 --> 16:15.900
Throwin' rocks at me.
-Where's your boat?

16:15.933 --> 16:18.600
-It's at the end of the island.
-So if we go over there,

16:18.633 --> 16:19.900
it's gonna have
a busted out window?

16:19.933 --> 16:21.733
-(bleep) right, dude, he busted
it out two days ago,

16:21.767 --> 16:24.200
and they just now
threw rocks at me
again, dude.

16:24.233 --> 16:26.200
-Did he hit you with any?
-My boat got hit,
I didn't get hit.

16:26.233 --> 16:27.933
-Okay.
What's his beef with you?

16:27.967 --> 16:29.900
-I don't know, it's--
this guy, every day,
he rides by, man,

16:29.933 --> 16:32.067
he makes fun of us,
like me and my wife,

16:32.067 --> 16:34.567
and-- and whoever's here,
and you know, cusses us out,

16:34.600 --> 16:36.433
and calls us homeless
and pieces of (bleep).
-Yeah.

16:36.467 --> 16:39.833
-Yeah.
-He throws rocks, man,
and I was down there

16:39.867 --> 16:42.333
on a little kayak, dude,
and he threw a rock at me,

16:42.367 --> 16:45.233
and it bounced-- I mean,
it almost put a hole
in my kayak.

16:45.267 --> 16:48.700
There's a hole in my front--
uh-- he busted out
the front windshield

16:48.733 --> 16:50.667
of my boat and shot it up
with BB's.

16:50.700 --> 16:53.900
-So you finally got fed up.
How'd you get his bike
from him?

16:53.933 --> 16:57.600
-He just-- I just-- I stopped
and got off my bike
and told him

16:57.633 --> 16:59.767
he was gonna quit
throwin' rocks at me,

16:59.800 --> 17:02.067
and he got off his bike
and walked away from it,

17:02.067 --> 17:03.633
and I picked it up
and walked home.

17:03.667 --> 17:05.200
-So you just kind
punked him out of it,
or what?

17:05.233 --> 17:07.267
-I didn't even have
to do that, he just got
right off his bike.

17:07.300 --> 17:09.367
-What'd you tell him?
-I told him if he threw rocks
at me again,

17:09.400 --> 17:10.600
I was gonna kick his ass.

17:10.633 --> 17:12.833
-Did you tell him anything
about the dog bitin' him?

17:12.867 --> 17:15.900
-Is that what he's saying?
-He saying that's that
how you got the bike from him,

17:15.933 --> 17:17.967
you threatened him
with the dog.
-No, not at all, man.

17:18.067 --> 17:20.100
They called me, like,
a couple names, said I was
going to jail

17:20.133 --> 17:21.600
and all this (bleep).
-Mm-hm.

17:21.633 --> 17:23.633
-They were on the phone, so.
-So you kinda knew
we were comin'?

17:23.667 --> 17:25.500
-Yeah, I mean, that's why
I was walkin' out to you guys.

17:25.533 --> 17:27.333
-Did you change your shirt?
-Yeah.

17:27.367 --> 17:29.200
-Where's-- Is that the white
shirt over there?

17:29.233 --> 17:30.533
-Yeah.

17:30.567 --> 17:32.667
-Well, I'm gonna see
what they got on
their end, man.

17:32.700 --> 17:34.367
At minimum I have you
stealin' his bike.

17:34.400 --> 17:37.400
I understand your frustrations
with this kid.

17:37.433 --> 17:39.067
-Yeah, somebody needs
to teach him some manners.

17:39.100 --> 17:42.167
I work hard, even though
I might be livin' this way,
it's what I have

17:42.200 --> 17:43.733
to work with right now.
-Right.

17:43.767 --> 17:45.467
-And so, I'm tryin'
to make the best of it,

17:45.500 --> 17:46.833
and I don't bother anybody.

17:46.867 --> 17:49.433
I try-- I try to keep things
cool, man, and (indistinct),

17:49.467 --> 17:52.067
I don't let no (bleep) happen
down here or nothin'.

17:52.067 --> 17:56.067
-You seem pretty clean
for bein' out here, man.
-I appreciate it, it takes

17:56.100 --> 17:58.433
a lotta effort to stay
this-- you know, looking clean,
whatever...

17:58.467 --> 18:02.167
-You clean from dope?
-Well, no, I'm not-- I'm not
all the way clean from drugs,

18:02.200 --> 18:04.200
no, but I-- I'm--
-What do you use?

18:04.233 --> 18:05.533
-I'm shower clean, heroin.

18:05.567 --> 18:06.600
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

18:06.633 --> 18:07.633
-How often you gotta use it?

18:07.667 --> 18:08.833
-I smoke every day.
-Yeah?

18:08.867 --> 18:10.833
-Yeah.
-You carry yourself well.

18:10.867 --> 18:12.567
-Thank you.
I don't bother nobody, man.

18:12.600 --> 18:15.133
These kids, just--
you know, they're just punks.

18:15.167 --> 18:19.067
-What's goin' on guys?
-Is this your bike right here?

18:19.067 --> 18:22.067
-Yours?
-It's my cousin's.

18:22.067 --> 18:24.333
-Yeah.
-Okay. It got stolen
from you, though?

18:24.367 --> 18:26.133
-Yeah.
-What-- What happened?

18:26.167 --> 18:30.067
-Um, there was kids
over here that were
throwing rocks towards

18:30.067 --> 18:31.967
the end of that little island
over there.

18:32.067 --> 18:34.700
And the guy, we don't know him,
he was just comin' towards us
on his bike with his dog.

18:34.733 --> 18:36.433
And we didn't think anything
of it, so I kept going,

18:36.467 --> 18:39.300
and he got off his bike,
and he just looked angry--
he looked angry, like,

18:39.333 --> 18:42.333
to see me, whatever,
and then, he got off
his bike, started cussin' at me,

18:42.367 --> 18:44.533
and I-- I backed up
a little bit, and I seen
his dog,

18:44.567 --> 18:45.700
so I backed up
a little more.

18:45.733 --> 18:48.367
Then he got my bike,
took it, and he was just--

18:48.400 --> 18:50.067
he just ended up takin'
the bike ridin' down here,

18:50.067 --> 18:53.100
and taking it back
to his little island.

18:53.133 --> 18:55.500
-Okay.
You guys weren't the ones
throwin' rocks?

18:55.533 --> 18:58.667
-No, it was three other kids,
they, uh-- they walked down
that way, I forget what street

18:58.700 --> 19:00.700
it's called, though.
You can see it, though,

19:00.733 --> 19:02.167
it's like right here
next to that house.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.533
-Okay. All right.
He was pretty convinced
you guys were the ones

19:04.567 --> 19:06.600
throwin' the rocks at him...
-Yeah, he-- No, he looked
at me...

19:06.633 --> 19:08.467
-he's sayin' that's why
he took your bike.

19:08.500 --> 19:11.200
-Yeah.
-Well, he's gonna go to jail
for stealin' your bike.

19:11.233 --> 19:14.800
At least we were able
to get it back for you.
-Thanks. Thank you.

19:14.833 --> 19:17.600
-If you know me,
you know I got good intentions
in my heart, bro.

19:17.633 --> 19:19.267
I don't threaten dudes.

19:19.300 --> 19:22.367
-We call feel your frustration,
man, I get it, I get
you're upset with...

19:22.400 --> 19:25.067
um, the kids throwin' rocks.

19:25.100 --> 19:27.667
According to them,
they're not even the guys
who were throwin' the rocks.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.867
Whether they're tellin'
the truth or not,
I don't know.

19:29.900 --> 19:33.467
But... we have no proof
that they were throwing rocks,

19:33.500 --> 19:35.600
we have proof that
you stole the bike, though.

19:35.633 --> 19:41.167
You changed your shirt
to... disguise yourself,
I suppose.

19:41.200 --> 19:44.200
Um...
you just can't do it, man.

19:44.233 --> 19:46.800
I follow the law,
and abide by the law
for the most part,

19:46.833 --> 19:49.333
and...
I just made a mistake today.

19:49.367 --> 19:51.700
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:51.733 --> 19:53.667
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:53.700 --> 19:54.833
Cover is code three.

19:54.867 --> 19:57.833
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:04.100 --> 20:05.633
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:08.400 --> 20:13.933
