00:00.100 --> 00:02.060
<i>Previously on "zero hour"...</i>

00:02.095 --> 00:03.344
I've seen things, dad-

00:03.380 --> 00:04.625
A nazi officer with my face.

00:04.660 --> 00:06.939
The only thing more dangerous
than hank finding out

00:06.975 --> 00:09.465
Who he really is
is someone else finding out.

00:09.500 --> 00:12.260
We're going after the cross.
The pirates will never get it.

00:12.295 --> 00:13.305
You want to know about

00:13.340 --> 00:16.140
The kid who grew up
in the orphanage.

00:16.175 --> 00:18.517
Once we find the cross,
i will tell you.

00:18.552 --> 00:20.860
Oh, my god. Theo.
I'm not going with you.

00:20.895 --> 00:22.077
This is the place
i belong now.

00:22.112 --> 00:23.926
We believed
that you were dead.

00:23.961 --> 00:25.705
The lord works
in mysterious ways.

00:25.740 --> 00:27.820
But it's not the lord's work
that you need. It's mine.

00:27.855 --> 00:29.820
This is the location
of the cross.

00:29.855 --> 00:31.300
The bugs got to it.

00:31.335 --> 00:32.785
Nobody move!

00:32.820 --> 00:34.300
It's over.
There's nothing there!

00:34.335 --> 00:36.157
Bring up the bugs.

00:36.192 --> 00:37.980
It's far from over.

00:45.840 --> 00:48.940
<i>9 is the number of judgment,</i>

00:48.975 --> 00:52.005
<i>The measure of our soul.</i>

00:52.040 --> 00:55.765
<i>When all secrets
come to light,</i>

00:55.800 --> 00:59.760
<i>The truth shall take
its toll.</i>

01:15.880 --> 01:17.880
Thank you for coming,
commandant.

01:17.915 --> 01:19.837
Please...

01:19.872 --> 01:21.725
Have a seat.

01:21.760 --> 01:24.180
May i ask why i've been
brought here?

01:24.215 --> 01:26.600
My wife just put dinner
on the table,

01:26.635 --> 01:28.525
And it's getting cold.

01:28.560 --> 01:30.640
Some things
are more important

01:30.675 --> 01:33.357
Than a warm meal...

01:33.392 --> 01:36.040
Or a pretty wife.

01:36.075 --> 01:38.965
Tell me...

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
Do you love the reich?

01:47.880 --> 01:50.885
I am a german.

01:50.920 --> 01:53.400
That is answer enough.

01:53.435 --> 01:55.245
You...

01:55.280 --> 01:58.080
Have shown
supreme loyalty

01:58.115 --> 02:00.005
To your country.

02:00.040 --> 02:02.240
In many ways,
you are the perfect german.

02:03.440 --> 02:05.325
So...

02:05.360 --> 02:08.919
We'd like you to join
our program,

02:08.955 --> 02:11.520
Become part of zero hour.

02:11.555 --> 02:12.725
What does that mean?

02:12.760 --> 02:15.440
It means you,
like the reich,

02:15.475 --> 02:18.320
<i>Will live forever.</i>

02:19.920 --> 02:22.800
A little wagner
always makes this easier

02:22.835 --> 02:24.685
For the patient.

02:24.720 --> 02:26.640
Do you mind
the sight of blood?

02:26.675 --> 02:28.440
I have seen plenty.

02:30.760 --> 02:34.620
It's only a few minutes
discomfort.

02:34.655 --> 02:38.480
A small price to pay
for eternity.

02:48.400 --> 02:53.840
Could you imagine
if they knew who you really are?

02:55.200 --> 02:56.885
Now isn't this funny?

02:56.920 --> 02:58.725
They're after
loyal nazi blood

02:58.760 --> 03:01.120
And end up
with two men of the church.

03:02.720 --> 03:05.920
These men will be punished
for their experiments.

03:05.955 --> 03:08.377
Yet we give them
our own blood.

03:08.412 --> 03:11.166
Even if our intentions
are noble,

03:11.201 --> 03:13.920
We might have
our own price to pay.

03:21.120 --> 03:24.080
What are they doing in there?
The cross is gone.

03:32.600 --> 03:35.060
Put the samples on ice.

03:35.095 --> 03:37.520
Get them to the truck.

03:38.880 --> 03:40.880
<i>And don't let them fall.</i>

03:43.440 --> 03:45.125
Hey.

03:45.160 --> 03:47.080
What do we do
with these three?

03:47.115 --> 03:49.560
Can't just leave 'em here.

03:50.480 --> 03:51.560
I'll do it.

03:52.680 --> 03:53.960
You pack the samples.

03:53.995 --> 03:56.240
All right.

03:59.400 --> 04:01.165
Here's how this works-

04:01.200 --> 04:04.480
You stay quiet,
you climb inside the pit,

04:04.515 --> 04:06.417
And i'll keep this painless.

04:06.452 --> 04:08.046
What did they do to you,
theo?

04:08.081 --> 04:09.605
Why are you working
for them?

04:09.640 --> 04:12.520
And i will shoot them
in the stomach

04:12.555 --> 04:13.677
And let them bleed out

04:13.712 --> 04:14.800
And force you to watch.

04:14.835 --> 04:16.399
Now move!

04:18.000 --> 04:20.760
Now get down into the pit.
Go.

04:20.795 --> 04:21.797
Theo, please!

04:21.832 --> 04:22.800
I said down!

04:22.835 --> 04:24.160
Oh!

04:26.880 --> 04:28.000
On your knees.

04:29.080 --> 04:30.925
On your knees.

04:30.960 --> 04:33.040
You don't really
want to do this.

04:33.075 --> 04:35.377
You remember who we were.

04:35.412 --> 04:37.680
I can see it in your eyes!

04:37.715 --> 04:40.040
I remember.

04:54.200 --> 04:57.000
Don't follow me.

05:02.120 --> 05:04.360
The cross is gone.

05:04.395 --> 05:06.600
The world didn't end.

05:07.720 --> 05:08.725
It's over.

05:08.760 --> 05:11.680
What about those bugs
they got?

05:11.715 --> 05:13.997
You, uh, worried
about them?

05:14.032 --> 05:16.036
You know what
i care about?

05:16.071 --> 05:18.005
You're not
in danger anymore.

05:18.040 --> 05:20.880
Whatever importance you had
was tied to the cross.

05:20.915 --> 05:24.200
Now you're just
plain old hank galliston.

05:24.235 --> 05:26.560
I'm plain and old.

05:26.595 --> 05:27.965
Thank you.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.920
So i, uh, i woke up a friend
in british intelligence.

05:29.955 --> 05:31.685
We're gonna track theo's ship

05:31.720 --> 05:33.800
And we're gonna launch
a rescue operation.

05:33.835 --> 05:36.005
You're seriously
gonna go after him?

05:36.040 --> 05:37.680
The brits are sending over
a chopper to pick me up,

05:37.715 --> 05:39.917
So, yeah, that's exactly
what i'm doing.

05:39.952 --> 05:41.656
I don't think
he wanted to be rescued.

05:41.691 --> 05:43.360
You don't know
what you're talking about.

05:43.395 --> 05:44.845
He just saved our lives.

05:44.880 --> 05:46.125
And told us
not to follow him.

05:46.160 --> 05:49.520
I would think you of all people
would understand that.

05:52.560 --> 05:53.805
Beck.

05:53.840 --> 05:56.200
Beck, just be careful.

05:56.235 --> 05:58.160
Yeah, you, too.

06:08.360 --> 06:12.080
The crew said you killed
three people

06:12.115 --> 06:15.177
Back on the island.

06:15.212 --> 06:18.205
Tell me how it felt.

06:18.240 --> 06:20.405
It didn't feel like anything.

06:20.440 --> 06:23.440
You know, i've killed
a lot of people,

06:23.475 --> 06:26.360
But i've
always felt something.

06:27.880 --> 06:30.860
You let them live,
didn't you?

06:30.895 --> 06:33.805
I need to focus on my work.

06:33.840 --> 06:36.920
These samples are
incredibly delicate right now.

06:36.955 --> 06:38.125
But i would like to know,

06:38.160 --> 06:41.720
What's so special
about these bugs?

06:41.755 --> 06:43.280
Why all of the precautions?

06:43.315 --> 06:45.685
Be careful with that.

06:45.720 --> 06:48.080
What happens
if i drop them?

06:49.640 --> 06:51.085
Whew.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.440
Would i die
of some horrible disease?

06:53.475 --> 06:55.285
I see what this is.

06:55.320 --> 06:58.420
You think
you still have power.

06:58.455 --> 07:01.485
But you're just
a hired gun,

07:01.520 --> 07:04.040
And you're about two days away
from getting your pink slip.

07:04.075 --> 07:05.800
You think that's all i am,
a hired gun?

07:05.835 --> 07:07.760
If you interfere
with my work...

07:10.320 --> 07:11.760
She will not be happy.

07:15.520 --> 07:17.320
Shut the door
on your way out.

07:21.760 --> 07:23.645
So the cross
was just gone?

07:23.680 --> 07:25.880
Yeah, all there was
was some frozen bugs,

07:25.915 --> 07:28.080
And then beck's husband,
he took them.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.485
Hank...

07:29.520 --> 07:32.165
Something happened.

07:32.200 --> 07:35.120
You know melanie lynch,
c.E.O. Of the 41 trust?

07:35.155 --> 07:37.205
I know who she is.

07:37.240 --> 07:40.400
She came by the office while
your dad as here, and...

07:40.435 --> 07:42.057
She took him.

07:42.092 --> 07:43.645
Took him?

07:43.680 --> 07:45.180
Like kidnapped him?

07:45.215 --> 07:46.645
No, not exactly.

07:46.680 --> 07:48.160
He seemed to know her.

07:48.195 --> 07:49.605
That doesn't make sense.

07:49.640 --> 07:50.760
I thought your mom
might have some answers

07:50.795 --> 07:51.880
So i tried calling her
a few times

07:51.915 --> 07:53.337
And i drove out
to the house,

07:53.372 --> 07:54.760
But she's
nowhere to be found.

07:54.795 --> 07:56.125
Well, keep trying.

07:56.160 --> 07:57.245
Okay, we're gonna be on

07:57.280 --> 07:59.520
The first flight
back to new york.

07:59.555 --> 08:00.600
I was wrong.

08:01.920 --> 08:03.120
It's not over.

08:03.155 --> 08:04.285
Not for me.

08:04.320 --> 08:06.760
<i>Somehow i'm still
at the center of it.</i>

08:08.720 --> 08:11.280
As you can see,
we're very well funded here.

08:11.315 --> 08:13.640
Yes,
it's a beautiful facility.

08:13.675 --> 08:14.725
Just last week,

08:14.760 --> 08:16.800
We received a burroughs 205

08:16.835 --> 08:19.645
Mainframe computer.

08:19.680 --> 08:21.600
I doubt you have that
at the university of chicago.

08:21.635 --> 08:24.520
If we did, they'd never
let me touch it.

08:24.555 --> 08:26.245
A shame.

08:26.280 --> 08:29.005
They're wasting
your talent over there.

08:29.040 --> 08:31.240
I'm doing work that's
years ahead of those guys.

08:31.275 --> 08:34.085
But i didn't get
my phd in kissing ass.

08:34.120 --> 08:37.840
This is-This is
what i like about americans.

08:37.875 --> 08:39.640
So straightforward.

08:40.880 --> 08:45.440
Now let me be
straightforward also.

08:45.475 --> 08:50.000
I think you are
the next big man...

08:50.035 --> 08:52.365
In molecular biology.

08:52.400 --> 08:57.200
And i want you to head
this laboratory.

08:57.235 --> 08:59.457
It's a wonderful offer,

08:59.492 --> 09:01.645
But i've decided...

09:01.680 --> 09:04.845
Albania is just
too far from home.

09:04.880 --> 09:08.720
Doctor, i don't think
you understand our offer.

09:08.755 --> 09:10.640
You see, we know about
the research

09:10.675 --> 09:12.417
You do in secret

09:12.452 --> 09:14.125
In your basement.

09:14.160 --> 09:15.405
I have no idea what you-

09:15.440 --> 09:19.280
And we want you
to continue it here

09:19.315 --> 09:21.840
With our full support.

09:24.960 --> 09:28.560
Most people would be
afraid of what i do.

09:28.595 --> 09:31.537
Small minds
always fear change.

09:31.572 --> 09:34.445
Galileo was labeled
a heretic

09:34.480 --> 09:38.240
For saying the earth moved
in the sky.

09:38.275 --> 09:42.000
Genius is never appreciated
in its time.

09:42.035 --> 09:43.645
And i believe...

09:43.680 --> 09:49.600
You are a true genius
for our time...

09:49.635 --> 09:51.997
The only man who can finish

09:52.032 --> 09:54.360
This great project
we started.

09:54.395 --> 09:56.365
So, dr. Galliston,

09:56.400 --> 09:59.280
Let me finish the tour.

10:15.640 --> 10:17.560
Dr. Galliston,
good news.

10:17.595 --> 10:18.960
What is that?

10:21.600 --> 10:23.005
You kept my work?

10:23.040 --> 10:24.440
My father always said
you were the only man

10:24.475 --> 10:28.000
Who could complete
this project.

10:28.035 --> 10:29.365
Now god has delivered you

10:29.400 --> 10:31.740
At the moment
we needed you most.

10:31.775 --> 10:34.080
The last piece
of our experiment

10:34.115 --> 10:36.525
Is headed to new york.

10:36.560 --> 10:39.040
Are you ready to finish
your work?

10:40.520 --> 10:43.360
I've waited 50 years
to find the courage.

10:43.395 --> 10:45.605
I'm ready.

10:45.640 --> 10:48.560
Then god's final hour
is almost here.

11:04.670 --> 11:07.310
We didn't sign up
for bugs.

11:07.345 --> 11:08.635
You talking to me?

11:08.670 --> 11:12.150
We were hired to transport
a relic, a piece of wood.

11:12.185 --> 11:13.235
Plan's changed.

11:13.270 --> 11:14.470
Yeah? Well,
we don't like change.

11:14.505 --> 11:17.270
And we don't like bugs.

11:17.305 --> 11:18.795
Now you tell me,

11:18.830 --> 11:20.770
Those things got a virus,
is that why they're sealed?

11:20.805 --> 11:22.710
What do you want, friend?
Do you want some more money?

11:22.745 --> 11:23.955
I can arrange that.

11:23.990 --> 11:25.555
Well, money's no good, is it,

11:25.590 --> 11:27.830
When you're sick
and bleeding out your ears?

11:27.865 --> 11:29.075
You listen to me,

11:29.110 --> 11:31.030
Either those things
go overboard

11:31.065 --> 11:33.870
Or you do, friend.

11:36.070 --> 11:37.955
It's a good thing
i'm a woman of faith

11:37.990 --> 11:40.910
Or this would make me nervous,
mr. Vincent.

11:40.945 --> 11:42.790
I'll give you
any resources you need,

11:42.825 --> 11:45.430
But protect the insects.

11:45.465 --> 11:47.195
I've got to go.

11:47.230 --> 11:48.630
Look, i already told you,
you can't be here.

11:48.665 --> 11:49.927
I'm not leaving
until i find him, okay?

11:49.962 --> 11:51.656
I'm sorry, melanie.
They barged in.

11:51.691 --> 11:53.350
Security's on the way.
It's okay, stan.

11:53.385 --> 11:54.827
Hank galliston, right?

11:54.862 --> 11:56.206
"Modern skeptic" magazine?

11:56.241 --> 11:57.555
What did you do
to my father?

11:57.590 --> 11:58.870
The only thing
i did to him

11:58.905 --> 12:00.647
Was offer him a job.

12:00.682 --> 12:02.390
If you don't believe me,

12:02.425 --> 12:04.590
Ask him.

12:05.910 --> 12:06.995
See?

12:07.030 --> 12:09.315
Safe and sound.

12:09.350 --> 12:11.155
Dad, what are you doing here?

12:11.190 --> 12:13.510
Just-Just picking up
a little consulting work.

12:13.545 --> 12:15.830
I can't explain now,
but we need to leave.

12:15.865 --> 12:17.350
Calm down.
I'm not going anywhere.

12:17.385 --> 12:19.235
Roland, listen,

12:19.270 --> 12:20.790
You don't understand
who these people are.

12:20.825 --> 12:21.875
Sure i do.

12:21.910 --> 12:24.550
Or curing malaria or whatever
they're telling you.

12:24.585 --> 12:25.955
Hank, stop.

12:25.990 --> 12:29.075
I know exactly
who they are.

12:29.110 --> 12:32.430
And i know exactly
what i'm doing.

12:32.465 --> 12:34.147
I must apologize for my son.

12:34.182 --> 12:36.366
He's always poking
into things.

12:36.401 --> 12:38.550
He certainly has
a curious streak.

12:38.585 --> 12:39.595
Dad-

12:39.630 --> 12:40.715
Listen to you.

12:40.750 --> 12:42.190
It's like
you're 10 years old again

12:42.225 --> 12:43.630
And you're breaking
into my study

12:43.665 --> 12:45.427
Going through my books

12:45.462 --> 12:47.190
While i'm trying to work.

12:47.225 --> 12:48.750
I have work to do.

12:48.785 --> 12:52.075
Go home.

12:52.110 --> 12:53.915
This is insane.

12:53.950 --> 12:55.510
Why-Why is everyone
in your life

12:55.545 --> 12:57.035
Hiding some secret
from you?

12:57.070 --> 12:58.310
Here you go.
It's disgustingly strong.

12:58.345 --> 13:01.030
You should love it.

13:01.065 --> 13:02.475
Mmm.

13:02.510 --> 13:04.430
We, uh, should get going
to your parents' house now.

13:04.465 --> 13:07.030
No, i need you guys
to try and figure out

13:07.065 --> 13:08.915
What kind of bugs
theo took.

13:08.950 --> 13:10.755
Maybe that will tell us
why he took them.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.550
Right there, that's everything
we can remember-

13:13.585 --> 13:14.915
Shape, sizes, color.

13:14.950 --> 13:17.550
We'll figure it out.
You better get moving.

13:23.670 --> 13:26.030
Mom?

13:26.065 --> 13:28.355
Hello?

13:28.390 --> 13:29.630
Mom, you home?

13:45.430 --> 13:50.550
Your mom never left
a single crumb on the table.

13:51.830 --> 13:53.435
The bedroom's a mess.

13:53.470 --> 13:55.510
Wherever your mom went,
she packed fast.

13:59.310 --> 14:00.675
You okay?

14:00.710 --> 14:03.155
Not even close.

14:03.190 --> 14:04.810
There's nothing here-

14:04.845 --> 14:06.430
No secret documents,

14:06.465 --> 14:09.235
No 41 trust,

14:09.270 --> 14:10.790
Nothing. It's just normal.

14:10.825 --> 14:12.310
Do you
remember this night?

14:14.070 --> 14:15.750
That horrible
quinoa meat loaf?

14:15.785 --> 14:17.347
We couldn't eat a bite.

14:17.382 --> 14:18.910
What are you doing?

14:18.945 --> 14:20.195
Uh...

14:20.230 --> 14:21.910
I was just remembering.

14:21.945 --> 14:23.155
Well, don't.

14:23.190 --> 14:24.710
I thought you said
you forgave me.

14:24.745 --> 14:26.315
I didn't forget, okay?

14:26.350 --> 14:28.470
We can't just pretend
like nothing happened.

14:28.505 --> 14:29.550
I'm not asking you
to do that.

14:29.585 --> 14:30.955
I wouldn't even-

14:30.990 --> 14:33.110
Do you realize
that i am doing

14:33.145 --> 14:35.195
Exactly what i did
two weeks ago?

14:35.230 --> 14:36.955
<i>Only i was tearing apart
our home</i>

14:36.990 --> 14:38.870
<i>Trying to figure out
who you were.</i>

14:38.905 --> 14:40.635
I'm trying to focus.

14:40.670 --> 14:42.590
I'm trying to find one thing

14:42.625 --> 14:43.915
That can explain

14:43.950 --> 14:46.470
What the hell
my father has been doing.

14:47.710 --> 14:49.475
Hey.

14:49.510 --> 14:50.950
I'm sorry.

14:57.390 --> 14:59.995
What was your dad saying
to you about

15:00.030 --> 15:01.950
You breaking in here
and taking his books?

15:01.985 --> 15:03.155
Oh, he had a book.

15:03.190 --> 15:06.790
I used to come in here
and try and look at it.

15:06.825 --> 15:08.590
It's still here.

15:09.750 --> 15:12.070
"The illustrated manual
of infectious diseases

15:12.105 --> 15:13.670
And symptoms."

15:15.070 --> 15:17.210
What is that?

15:17.245 --> 15:19.350
That's weird.

15:22.350 --> 15:26.190
Your dad put this
in your favorite book, hank.

15:26.225 --> 15:28.430
He meant for you
to find this.

15:28.465 --> 15:30.070
There's only one number.

15:32.790 --> 15:34.470
Hello.

16:17.630 --> 16:19.670
Clear.

16:23.670 --> 16:26.315
That is not good.

16:26.350 --> 16:27.430
Look, we need to get
above deck

16:27.465 --> 16:29.430
And quarantine the ship.

16:29.465 --> 16:31.195
Not yet.

16:31.230 --> 16:34.035
Not until i find him.

16:34.070 --> 16:36.830
Yeah,
you do what you have to.

17:21.250 --> 17:22.490
Hey, don't get too close.

17:22.525 --> 17:23.694
I checked the bodies.

17:23.730 --> 17:25.210
Vincent and theo
must have escaped.

17:25.244 --> 17:26.535
Lucky them.

17:26.569 --> 17:27.890
Now what do we do?

17:29.090 --> 17:30.255
Wait around
to just drop dead?

17:30.290 --> 17:31.895
We don't know
what killed the crew.

17:31.930 --> 17:33.850
So we wait for
disease containment to get here

17:33.885 --> 17:35.095
And we stay calm.

17:35.130 --> 17:37.690
I saw
an open biohazard container

17:37.725 --> 17:39.067
And a dead crew.

17:39.102 --> 17:40.375
You do the math.

17:40.410 --> 17:42.550
Look,
you're after your husband.

17:42.585 --> 17:44.617
You take risks for that.
I get it.

17:44.652 --> 17:46.511
But i got six guys
on this ship

17:46.546 --> 17:48.258
Wondering
if they'll die today,

17:48.293 --> 17:49.970
And they all
have families, too.

17:51.450 --> 17:54.770
I hope it was worth it.

18:19.410 --> 18:22.095
Come inside, quick.

18:22.130 --> 18:24.050
Mom, what is this place?

18:24.085 --> 18:25.935
What the hell is going on?

18:25.970 --> 18:27.850
Oh, there's
so much to talk about.

18:27.885 --> 18:29.730
I-I thought some tea
would be good.

18:29.765 --> 18:32.495
Mom, we don't want tea.

18:32.530 --> 18:36.210
It looks like she's ready
for the end of the world.

18:36.245 --> 18:38.210
Two earl greys
and a-A chai for laila?

18:38.245 --> 18:39.490
Did i get that right?

18:39.525 --> 18:40.850
Mom!

18:42.370 --> 18:44.255
We need to talk now.

18:44.290 --> 18:46.970
Tell me
what you're doing here.

18:47.005 --> 18:48.967
Right.

18:49.002 --> 18:50.895
Of course.

18:50.930 --> 18:52.495
Oh, god help me.

18:52.530 --> 18:54.610
I never wanted
to have this conversation.

18:54.645 --> 18:56.570
We thought we'd get away
with it.

18:56.605 --> 18:58.307
Get away with what?

18:58.342 --> 18:59.975
<i>You see, your...</i>

19:00.010 --> 19:03.050
<i>Your father,
he worked for the trust</i>

19:03.085 --> 19:05.187
<i>A long time ago.</i>

19:05.222 --> 19:07.290
<i>And so did i.</i>

19:10.650 --> 19:14.610
The metaphase stage
of mitosis appears normal.

19:14.645 --> 19:17.107
So far, a perfect sample.

19:17.142 --> 19:19.570
The chromosome walls...

19:20.810 --> 19:23.030
They're breaking apart.

19:23.065 --> 19:25.250
The test is negative.

19:26.490 --> 19:28.370
Another failure.

19:35.090 --> 19:36.535
Sorry.

19:36.570 --> 19:37.775
I thought i was alone.

19:37.810 --> 19:40.410
You realize i've been here
for five years

19:40.445 --> 19:42.327
With nothing
to show for it?

19:42.362 --> 19:44.175
If you hate it here so much,

19:44.210 --> 19:46.570
Why don't you leave,
do something else?

19:46.605 --> 19:48.930
I'm the only one
who can finish this.

19:48.965 --> 19:50.335
I have...

19:50.370 --> 19:53.330
A moral obligation
to the future of science.

19:53.365 --> 19:56.930
You think this is moral,
what you do?

19:56.965 --> 19:58.495
Don't condescend.

19:58.530 --> 20:01.010
A clever nurse
is still just a nurse.

20:01.045 --> 20:03.335
You know what?

20:03.370 --> 20:06.850
I've listened to you complain
about your failures for years.

20:06.885 --> 20:11.490
Maybe it's time for you
to finally see one.

20:39.170 --> 20:42.290
I can't believe
you've never been down here.

20:42.325 --> 20:45.210
There was no real reason.

20:45.245 --> 20:47.695
Look in there.

20:47.730 --> 20:49.970
That's your reason.

20:59.490 --> 21:02.850
He lives his whole life
in this room.

21:02.885 --> 21:06.210
He gets shots,
three meals a day,

21:06.245 --> 21:08.707
And nothing else.

21:08.742 --> 21:11.135
I didn't realize...

21:11.170 --> 21:14.490
Your work has a face
and a soul

21:14.525 --> 21:17.810
Whether you look at them
or not.

21:19.210 --> 21:22.215
<i>I wanted to leave
a hundred times,</i>

21:22.250 --> 21:24.490
But i thought i could help
the children if i stayed.

21:24.525 --> 21:28.090
Tell me what
the experiments were for.

21:29.170 --> 21:30.935
Your father...

21:30.970 --> 21:33.770
Was trying to create life
in a laboratory.

21:33.805 --> 21:35.535
Oh, god.

21:35.570 --> 21:38.450
You didn't find me
in some german orphanage,

21:38.485 --> 21:39.695
Did you?

21:39.730 --> 21:42.170
Hank,
i'm so, so sorry.

21:42.205 --> 21:44.610
Mom, tell me straight.

21:46.610 --> 21:49.130
Your father achieved
the first gestational cloning

21:49.165 --> 21:50.610
Of a human being.

21:52.210 --> 21:55.130
Hank, he created you.

22:04.410 --> 22:05.535
Hank.

22:05.570 --> 22:07.530
There's a few things
you take for granted

22:07.565 --> 22:08.935
As human beings, right,

22:08.970 --> 22:11.410
Simple things-
That we have a brain,

22:11.445 --> 22:15.895
Lungs, red blood cells...

22:15.930 --> 22:18.310
That we're gonna grow old
someday...

22:18.345 --> 22:20.690
That we're born
of a father and mother,

22:20.725 --> 22:23.467
Like everyone else.

22:23.502 --> 22:26.036
You take that away,

22:26.071 --> 22:28.570
The fundamental thing,

22:28.605 --> 22:30.050
And wh-

22:31.450 --> 22:33.215
Hey.

22:33.250 --> 22:35.335
I can't possibly imagine

22:35.370 --> 22:37.815
What you are going through
right now,

22:37.850 --> 22:41.210
But i want you to know
that i'm here for you.

22:46.730 --> 22:48.250
Look, the earth
is still turning,

22:48.285 --> 22:49.495
The sun's gonna come up,

22:49.530 --> 22:51.130
And you are still
the same man

22:51.165 --> 22:52.375
That you were before.

22:52.410 --> 22:55.370
But i have no idea
who the hell that man is.

22:55.405 --> 22:56.975
Hank.

22:57.010 --> 22:58.250
I'm so sorry
we kept this from you.

22:58.285 --> 22:59.415
You have to understand,

22:59.450 --> 23:01.050
Whatever else
your father did,

23:01.085 --> 23:02.615
He did bring you
into this world.

23:02.650 --> 23:05.015
You weren't made
in a test tube, hank.

23:05.050 --> 23:07.250
You were born of a woman,
a surrogate mother.

23:07.285 --> 23:09.415
<i>And when you
came into this world,</i>

23:09.450 --> 23:11.890
<i>You were just like
any other baby.</i>

23:13.490 --> 23:15.450
What is it? What's so important
at 2:00 in the morning?

23:15.485 --> 23:17.787
Uh, this baby...
you have to see.

23:17.822 --> 23:20.090
Why? What's wrong
with this one?

23:20.125 --> 23:21.707
That's just it.

23:21.742 --> 23:23.290
Nothing's wrong.

23:31.010 --> 23:33.810
I tested
everything i could...

23:35.210 --> 23:37.850
Blood, tissue...

23:37.885 --> 23:40.455
Urine, saliva.

23:40.490 --> 23:42.490
You see why i brought him
to you?

23:42.525 --> 23:44.290
It finally worked.

23:49.210 --> 23:51.770
So why do i feel so hollow?

23:53.490 --> 23:54.975
Probably because

23:55.010 --> 23:57.850
So many people had to suffer
for you to get here.

23:57.885 --> 23:59.615
You don't understand.

23:59.650 --> 24:03.410
He's gonna have it
ten times worse.

24:03.445 --> 24:04.535
What do you mean?

24:04.570 --> 24:06.310
He's not a person to them.

24:06.345 --> 24:08.237
He's just subject 3-5-2,

24:08.272 --> 24:10.095
The experiment that worked.

24:10.130 --> 24:12.330
They'll turn him inside out
to find out why.

24:12.365 --> 24:14.090
You can't let them
do that.

24:15.650 --> 24:16.970
Listen...

24:18.850 --> 24:20.775
Listen...

24:20.810 --> 24:22.270
You and i
are the only people

24:22.305 --> 24:24.697
Who know
that this baby lived.

24:24.732 --> 24:27.090
You can say he died
in childbirth

24:27.125 --> 24:28.530
Along with the mother.

24:28.565 --> 24:29.575
And then what?

24:29.610 --> 24:32.410
I'll take him out of here...

24:32.445 --> 24:34.250
Tonight.

24:37.850 --> 24:39.730
Can you help me?

24:41.970 --> 24:44.535
<i>I not only helped him,
i went with him.</i>

24:44.570 --> 24:47.490
<i>We changed our names,
posed as a family.</i>

24:47.525 --> 24:50.410
And for almost 50 years,
we kept you hidden.

24:50.445 --> 24:52.495
Why come forward now?

24:52.530 --> 24:55.210
They were getting too close
to finding you, hank.

24:55.245 --> 24:56.627
They must never know
you exist.

24:56.662 --> 24:58.456
Your father
is buying you time

24:58.491 --> 25:00.250
So that you can run,
both of you,

25:00.285 --> 25:01.935
Like we did.

25:01.970 --> 25:03.830
Well,
that's not gonna happen.

25:03.865 --> 25:05.690
Dad risked his life
for me.

25:05.725 --> 25:07.547
We are going back there

25:07.582 --> 25:09.335
And we're gonna rescue him.

25:09.370 --> 25:10.890
I think it's too late
for that.

25:10.925 --> 25:13.267
He sent me a message...

25:13.302 --> 25:15.610
Right before you got here.

25:17.530 --> 25:19.255
I hate bugs.

25:19.290 --> 25:21.070
We're never gonna find
the right one.

25:21.105 --> 25:22.815
Well, we've already
narrowed it down

25:22.850 --> 25:25.230
To some sort of beetle,
so that's a start.

25:25.265 --> 25:27.610
Yeah, well, there's
400,000 species of beetle.

25:27.645 --> 25:29.770
So this should only take,
i don't know,

25:29.805 --> 25:31.890
The rest of our life.

25:31.925 --> 25:33.815
Yeah, maybe not.

25:33.850 --> 25:36.650
Maybe they want the one
with religious significance,

25:36.685 --> 25:38.255
You know?

25:38.290 --> 25:39.610
There are tons of mentions
in the bible

25:39.645 --> 25:41.375
Of locusts,
moths, scorpions,

25:41.410 --> 25:43.830
But there's only one single
mention of the beetle,

25:43.865 --> 25:46.250
Buried in greek translation
in the old testament.

25:46.285 --> 25:47.690
Please enlighten me.

25:47.725 --> 25:49.175
Habakkuk 2:11-

25:49.210 --> 25:51.015
"For the stone
shall cry out of the wall

25:51.050 --> 25:53.890
And the beetle
out of the timber shall speak."

25:53.925 --> 25:55.850
The beetle
out of the timber?

25:55.885 --> 25:58.290
Uh-Huh.

26:02.370 --> 26:04.050
Beetle out of the timber.

26:06.170 --> 26:08.810
Uh, you just gave me
an idea.

26:13.730 --> 26:15.770
The crew
didn't die of a virus.

26:15.805 --> 26:17.810
The ship's completely clean.

26:17.845 --> 26:19.607
Oh, thank god.

26:19.642 --> 26:21.335
And so is this.

26:21.370 --> 26:23.255
Any idea
what did kill the crew?

26:23.290 --> 26:26.090
Their blood's testing positive
for halon gas.

26:26.125 --> 26:27.415
Halon?

26:27.450 --> 26:28.695
Sorry. What-What am i
missing here?

26:28.730 --> 26:31.610
Halon gas-It's used
to suppress fires in ships.

26:31.645 --> 26:33.867
It sucks the oxygen
out of a room.

26:33.902 --> 26:36.236
Normally you get the people
out first.

26:36.271 --> 26:38.570
Oh, so the crew suffocated
to death?

26:38.605 --> 26:39.775
Yeah, the door was locked.

26:39.810 --> 26:42.190
Vincent must have
sealed them in first.

26:42.225 --> 26:44.570
Somebody did.
You sure it was vincent?

26:50.410 --> 26:54.450
They say god delivers
everything in its time.

26:54.485 --> 26:58.130
But it doesn't hurt
to have good help.

26:58.165 --> 27:00.130
Oh.

27:01.930 --> 27:03.910
These are beautiful,
aren't they?

27:03.945 --> 27:05.890
We have to start
working on them

27:05.925 --> 27:07.090
As soon as possible.

27:07.125 --> 27:08.535
Of course.

27:08.570 --> 27:11.575
Stan,
please pay mr. Vincent.

27:11.610 --> 27:14.170
I think you'll find
our severance package generous.

27:14.205 --> 27:15.747
I don't want generosity.

27:15.782 --> 27:17.516
I want what i'm owed.

27:17.551 --> 27:19.215
You promised me answers.

27:19.250 --> 27:22.330
You're still the sad
little orphan boy, aren't you,

27:22.365 --> 27:25.930
Looking for meaning
in all the misery?

27:25.965 --> 27:29.490
You were
a failed experiment,

27:29.525 --> 27:31.575
A mistake,

27:31.610 --> 27:34.970
A sacrifice
on the altar of progress.

27:35.005 --> 27:37.770
Progress towards what?

27:40.170 --> 27:43.170
I can only tell that
to the faithful.

27:43.205 --> 27:46.050
A man who believes in nothing

27:46.085 --> 27:47.255
Is dangerous.

27:47.290 --> 27:49.130
Don't you think
it's better

27:49.165 --> 27:50.970
To have that man
on your side?

28:06.890 --> 28:08.095
You don't have to hold me.

28:08.130 --> 28:10.070
I'm a volunteer,
not a prisoner.

28:10.105 --> 28:12.010
Yeah?
Is that what you think?

28:17.530 --> 28:19.770
I don't know...

28:19.805 --> 28:21.650
Wow. Okay.

28:21.685 --> 28:24.215
I...

28:24.250 --> 28:26.330
I don't know even know
what to say.

28:26.365 --> 28:28.455
Don't say anything.

28:28.490 --> 28:33.210
You realize we-We can't
tell anybody about this.

28:34.330 --> 28:36.090
W-We can't talk about it.

28:38.250 --> 28:40.490
Okay.

28:41.610 --> 28:43.335
Okay, so-So they-

28:43.370 --> 28:45.610
They cloned the blood
of korbin sturm.

28:45.645 --> 28:47.375
Why him?

28:47.410 --> 28:49.330
It wasn't about
korbin sturm,

28:49.365 --> 28:50.535
Not at first.

28:50.570 --> 28:52.570
I mean, his was just one
of hundreds

28:52.605 --> 28:54.375
Of nazi blood samples.

28:54.410 --> 28:56.090
So maybe they were trying
to repopulate the earth

28:56.125 --> 28:57.375
With the aryan race.

28:57.410 --> 28:58.975
No, clones are just
replicated d.N.A.

28:59.010 --> 29:01.290
They-They-They still take
nine months for them to grow,

29:01.325 --> 29:02.895
Like anyone else.

29:02.930 --> 29:05.650
And have them do it
the old-Fashioned way?

29:05.685 --> 29:07.127
There's something else
they're doing.

29:07.162 --> 29:08.570
There's a reason
they need your father.

29:08.605 --> 29:12.410
He got a message
to my mom.

29:12.445 --> 29:13.947
They're moving him.

29:13.982 --> 29:15.415
Didn't know where.

29:15.450 --> 29:18.410
We need to find out
why they want him.

29:18.445 --> 29:20.207
The bugs.

29:20.242 --> 29:21.935
Excuse me?

29:21.970 --> 29:24.070
They want him
because of the bugs.

29:24.105 --> 29:26.397
Come here.
Let me show you something.

29:26.432 --> 29:28.690
This is the closest thing
we could find.

29:28.725 --> 29:30.810
Is this the bug
that theo took?

29:30.845 --> 29:32.415
Sure looks like it.

29:32.450 --> 29:34.890
All right, well,
this nasty little fellow,

29:34.925 --> 29:37.295
<i>This is
xestobium rufovillosum,</i>

29:37.330 --> 29:40.375
<i>Also known
as the death watch beetle.</i>

29:40.410 --> 29:43.210
<i>They're known for
making this ticking sound.</i>

29:43.245 --> 29:44.415
<i>People used to think they were</i>

29:44.450 --> 29:48.690
And what's really interesting,
the only thing this guy eats-

29:48.725 --> 29:49.855
Wood.

29:49.890 --> 29:51.930
So you think those beetles
consumed the cross?

29:51.965 --> 29:53.175
That's my theory.

29:53.210 --> 29:55.130
And see? They're not even
native to the faroes.

29:55.165 --> 29:56.730
They can't survive
in those temperatures.

29:56.765 --> 29:59.855
They froze in place
in 1938.

29:59.890 --> 30:03.495
<i>Particles of the cross
preserved inside of them.</i>

30:03.530 --> 30:06.730
This explains why the shepherds
hid the cross in 1938

30:06.765 --> 30:09.930
When the nazis were
on the verge of human cloning.

30:09.965 --> 30:12.255
<i>All that talk
about the cross</i>

30:12.290 --> 30:14.690
<i>Leading to
the end of the world?</i>

30:14.725 --> 30:17.495
It never made sense before.

30:17.530 --> 30:19.495
They didn't want
the cross itself.

30:19.530 --> 30:21.890
<i>They wanted
what was inside of it.</i>

30:21.925 --> 30:23.695
You need to come see this.

30:23.730 --> 30:25.655
<i>Christ died
on the cross.</i>

30:25.690 --> 30:28.970
But more importantly,
he bled on the cross.

30:29.005 --> 30:31.987
You think they're after
the blood of christ?

30:32.022 --> 30:34.970
You've read the bible
a few times, right?

30:36.290 --> 30:38.215
<i>Book of revelations-</i>

30:38.250 --> 30:41.530
Remember what happens right
before the end of the world?

30:41.565 --> 30:43.695
Christ returns to earth.

30:43.730 --> 30:45.530
It's a miracle,
but we did it.

30:45.565 --> 30:47.387
We pulled enough
d.N.A. Fragments

30:47.422 --> 30:49.116
To reform
his complete genome.

30:49.151 --> 30:50.775
What exactly
am i looking at?

30:50.810 --> 30:53.690
The most holy vision
in the universe-

30:53.725 --> 30:55.890
The end of all things-

30:55.925 --> 30:58.775
A blueprint

30:58.810 --> 31:01.690
For the son of god.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.600
What do i
have to say here?

31:13.635 --> 31:15.797
You can't go after
your dad.

31:15.832 --> 31:17.925
I am not
gonna leave him behind.

31:17.960 --> 31:21.160
But you are the last person
who should be doing this.

31:21.195 --> 31:23.005
If they catch you,

31:23.040 --> 31:25.005
If they learn who you are...

31:25.040 --> 31:28.000
They will take you
and test you and hurt you.

31:28.035 --> 31:29.397
You...

31:29.432 --> 31:30.725
Hank,

31:30.760 --> 31:32.800
Let someone else go.

31:36.520 --> 31:39.205
You know,
you once said to me

31:39.240 --> 31:41.960
That you would do anything
if i asked.

31:41.995 --> 31:45.160
Well, i'm asking now.

31:48.320 --> 31:50.080
Run away with me.

31:52.160 --> 31:54.080
Wherever we went,
they'd follow.

31:54.115 --> 31:56.565
I know ways to disappear.

31:56.600 --> 31:59.640
You give me six hours,
i will set the whole thing up.

31:59.675 --> 32:00.885
We can just-

32:00.920 --> 32:03.400
We could vanish
to some beach paradise

32:03.435 --> 32:05.685
Where no one will ever
find us.

32:05.720 --> 32:09.080
You know i can't leave
until he's safe.

32:09.115 --> 32:10.840
You know that.

32:12.760 --> 32:13.885
Okay.

32:13.920 --> 32:16.000
What about after?

32:17.920 --> 32:20.085
The good news is,
we extracted d.N.A.

32:20.120 --> 32:23.480
From 2,000-Year-Old blood
in the belly of wood beetles.

32:23.515 --> 32:26.520
Technically,
that shouldn't be possible.

32:26.555 --> 32:28.285
So why
don't you sound happy?

32:28.320 --> 32:30.160
It's a dead end. We can't
complete the next step.

32:30.195 --> 32:32.125
Are you so sure?

32:32.160 --> 32:34.080
How many times have we tried
to clone human d.N.A.?

32:34.115 --> 32:36.400
A perfect clone just-
Just isn't possible.

32:36.435 --> 32:38.565
Not for you.

32:38.600 --> 32:40.880
But the man who nearly
cracked human cloning

32:40.915 --> 32:42.457
Has reappeared

32:42.492 --> 32:43.965
After 50 years.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.760
Well,
that's quite a coincidence.

32:46.795 --> 32:49.520
How exactly
did he disappear?

32:49.555 --> 32:51.085
He got cold feet.

32:51.120 --> 32:53.200
He was at the precipice
of a great discovery

32:53.235 --> 32:55.120
And he ran away from it.

32:55.155 --> 32:56.957
But now he's back?

32:56.992 --> 32:58.725
He said he was struck

32:58.760 --> 33:01.080
With a sudden desire
to finish his great work.

33:01.115 --> 33:02.477
You believe him?

33:02.512 --> 33:03.805
Not entirely.

33:03.840 --> 33:05.045
Let me talk to him.

33:05.080 --> 33:07.160
I've found people have
a very hard time

33:07.195 --> 33:09.720
Lying to me.

33:10.640 --> 33:11.940
This here is the key

33:11.975 --> 33:13.205
To me finding my husband

33:13.240 --> 33:17.520
This is the container that theo
used to transport the bugs.

33:17.555 --> 33:19.217
Should we be worried
about that?

33:19.252 --> 33:21.006
That's
the interesting thing.

33:21.041 --> 33:22.725
There is no biohazard
in here.

33:22.760 --> 33:25.240
My theory-This is a great way
to transport something

33:25.275 --> 33:26.840
If you don't want people
to look at it.

33:26.875 --> 33:28.897
So it's just another
cover story.

33:28.932 --> 33:30.885
All right.
Let's print out a list

33:30.920 --> 33:33.565
Of every 41 trust property
and clinic.

33:33.600 --> 33:36.920
Let's see which ones are related
to biohazardous materials-

33:36.955 --> 33:39.097
Toxins, viruses,
that kind of thing.

33:39.132 --> 33:41.026
Hank,
it's a massive organization.

33:41.061 --> 33:42.920
There's hundreds
of properties.

33:42.955 --> 33:45.800
Then let's get started.

34:01.800 --> 34:05.925
I had a funny feeling
i'd find you in here.

34:05.960 --> 34:08.520
I'm missing an important file
on r.N.A. Replication.

34:08.554 --> 34:10.280
I can't do any more work
until i find it.

34:13.920 --> 34:15.980
I know that you're lying.

34:16.014 --> 34:18.005
Well, i'm not. I swear.

34:18.040 --> 34:21.080
Do it again,
i'll take your eye.

34:21.114 --> 34:22.737
You have been lying

34:22.772 --> 34:25.065
This whole time,

34:25.101 --> 34:27.360
Haven't you...

34:27.395 --> 34:29.005
Roland?

34:29.040 --> 34:31.139
Tell me what you want.

34:31.175 --> 34:33.239
I want you to remember me.

34:33.275 --> 34:34.844
I'm sorry. I...

34:34.880 --> 34:36.320
I don't think we've met.

34:36.355 --> 34:38.717
Are you sure?

34:38.752 --> 34:41.080
Look closer.

34:41.114 --> 34:43.000
Yeah?

34:45.880 --> 34:50.280
Do you
remember me now, doctor?

34:50.315 --> 34:53.120
'Cause i remember you.

35:01.650 --> 35:05.290
I can't find
any properties that match.

35:05.325 --> 35:06.530
I'm gonna head back
to the bureau

35:06.565 --> 35:08.335
And sort through tax records.

35:08.370 --> 35:10.930
You're fast. I got
another hour here at least.

35:12.210 --> 35:15.510
Listen, i-I don't really want
to ask this,

35:15.545 --> 35:18.810
But do you have any idea
where laila is?

35:24.970 --> 35:26.535
You're ten minutes late.

35:26.570 --> 35:28.390
You're lucky
i showed up at all.

35:28.425 --> 35:30.175
You might be
my best customer.

35:30.210 --> 35:32.170
You pay in cash,
you never get caught,

35:32.205 --> 35:33.895
And you're easy on the eyes,

35:33.930 --> 35:36.210
So i got no problem
doing a rush job for you.

35:36.245 --> 35:39.055
But this guy-
This is a risk for me.

35:39.090 --> 35:41.050
He's gonna be traveling
with me the whole time,

35:41.085 --> 35:42.970
And we're gonna be
far away from here.

35:45.690 --> 35:49.250
It's like staring
into the face of god.

35:50.730 --> 35:53.455
We're so close.

35:53.490 --> 35:56.290
And now you're telling me
he's lying to us?

35:56.325 --> 35:58.055
Well, half a lie.

35:58.090 --> 36:00.170
He doesn't have
all the pieces he needs.

36:00.205 --> 36:01.415
Not yet.

36:01.450 --> 36:03.135
How can you be sure?

36:03.170 --> 36:07.730
I met this man
once before...

36:09.970 --> 36:12.495
A long time ago.

36:12.530 --> 36:14.530
Wake up. We're leaving.

36:15.850 --> 36:17.415
What is that?

36:17.450 --> 36:18.970
What are you doing?
It's a new baby.

36:19.005 --> 36:20.490
It's kind of like
a brother of yours.

36:20.525 --> 36:22.050
Come on.

36:23.170 --> 36:25.410
Bring the blanket.
Bring the blanket.

36:28.770 --> 36:31.490
Come on.
What are you doing?

36:31.525 --> 36:32.695
We have to go.

36:32.730 --> 36:34.610
I'm almost finished.

36:36.530 --> 36:38.375
There is no more time.

36:38.410 --> 36:39.695
I have to destroy my samples.

36:39.730 --> 36:41.455
Why? They can't
do anything without you.

36:41.490 --> 36:43.830
It's not just my work.
It's about this blood.

36:43.865 --> 36:46.170
There's something in it
that makes it work.

36:46.205 --> 36:49.930
They won't be able
to finish my work.

37:11.810 --> 37:13.695
It's okay.

37:13.730 --> 37:16.810
We're free now.
We're not ever going back.

37:19.810 --> 37:21.850
Brother.

37:29.370 --> 37:31.450
We can't
just leave him here.

37:31.485 --> 37:33.530
Look at him.
Look at his eyes.

37:33.565 --> 37:35.135
We'll be crossing borders.

37:35.170 --> 37:36.410
They may be looking for us.
He attracts too much attention.

37:36.445 --> 37:37.855
I'll take that risk.

37:37.890 --> 37:40.850
It's not just us.
Think of the baby.

37:40.885 --> 37:42.170
If either of us get caught,

37:42.205 --> 37:43.930
His life is over.

37:43.965 --> 37:45.575
Please.

37:45.610 --> 37:48.650
It's the only way.

37:50.330 --> 37:54.090
Come here.

37:55.330 --> 37:57.250
They'll be good to you here.

38:02.690 --> 38:05.175
Someday...

38:05.210 --> 38:07.050
We will come back
for you.

38:07.085 --> 38:09.050
Okay?

38:21.170 --> 38:23.015
We had the answer.

38:23.050 --> 38:24.890
For 50 years,
we had the answer

38:24.925 --> 38:27.007
In that blood sample,

38:27.042 --> 38:29.090
And he destroyed it.

38:29.125 --> 38:30.770
Not all of it.

38:32.570 --> 38:35.415
That baby was a perfect copy,

38:35.450 --> 38:39.330
And he has the same blood
in his veins.

38:39.365 --> 38:43.210
And they raised
that boy as their own.

38:47.810 --> 38:51.050
Hank galliston.

39:49.770 --> 39:52.250
<i>This is laila.
Leave a message.</i>

39:52.285 --> 39:53.975
Yeah, it's me.

39:54.010 --> 39:55.930
Listen, give me a call
when you get this, okay?

39:55.965 --> 39:57.450
I think i know
how to find my dad.
