WEBVTT

00:04.172 --> 00:06.140
* We're bound to no land

00:06.174 --> 00:08.042
* Starting our own dance

00:08.076 --> 00:11.779
* Fading, liberating

00:11.812 --> 00:15.316
* Oh, oh, way, oh, oh

00:15.349 --> 00:19.320
* Way, oh, this time,
I'm telling you *

00:19.353 --> 00:23.224
* We shot the sun down,
we shot the sun... *

00:23.257 --> 00:25.159
Oh, boy.
They kept me late at the base,

00:25.193 --> 00:29.163
so we're late
for Daddy and Me again, kiddo.

00:29.197 --> 00:32.666
My schmiddo, diddo.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.135
God, you're the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

00:34.168 --> 00:36.137
Just going
to drop off the ice cream

00:36.170 --> 00:38.506
so it doesn't melt on us, 'kay?
I'll be back.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.542
Two shakes!

00:45.213 --> 00:46.714
Kiddo,

00:46.747 --> 00:48.149
schmiddo,

00:48.182 --> 00:49.583
diddo,

00:49.617 --> 00:52.253
liddo...

00:54.522 --> 00:58.192
...middo...

01:04.132 --> 01:05.133
No! No!

01:05.166 --> 01:07.235
Wait! Wait! Stop!

01:07.268 --> 01:10.238
No! No!

01:11.272 --> 01:13.107
Wait! Wait!

01:13.141 --> 01:15.443
No! My baby's in the car!

01:15.476 --> 01:18.346
Please! Please! No!

01:18.379 --> 01:20.448
No! My baby's in the car!

01:20.481 --> 01:22.150
My baby's in the car!

01:24.618 --> 01:27.355
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:27.388 --> 01:29.790
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:29.823 --> 01:32.293
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:32.326 --> 01:33.594
* How, how, how, how

01:33.627 --> 01:36.164
* Hey, hey

01:41.802 --> 01:43.371
* You gotta come on.

01:51.179 --> 01:52.580
PRIDE:
Let me know.

01:52.613 --> 01:53.614
Will do.

01:53.647 --> 01:56.350
BRODY :
Baby is how old?

01:56.384 --> 01:58.152
Nine months. Name's Lucy.

01:58.186 --> 01:59.553
That the
father there?

01:59.587 --> 02:02.190
PRIDE:
Yeah. Naval Commander
Josh Newman,

02:02.223 --> 02:03.891
out of Belle Chasse.

02:03.924 --> 02:05.659
He get a good
look at the driver?

02:05.693 --> 02:08.829
No. Only made out that
the driver was wearing a hoodie.

02:08.862 --> 02:11.599
Couldn't be sure
if it was a male. Assumed so.

02:11.632 --> 02:14.602
We got JPSO and Coast Guard
assisting with air support,

02:14.635 --> 02:16.504
NOPD on the ground.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.839
AMBER Alert?
15 minutes ago.

02:18.872 --> 02:21.609
Got citywide checkpoints,
live monitoring

02:21.642 --> 02:22.710
of city traffic cams.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.745
So...

02:24.778 --> 02:27.715
thief took the car keys
from the door.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.452
I'll dust for prints,
talk to the neighbors,

02:31.485 --> 02:33.587
see if anyone saw anything.

02:33.621 --> 02:35.856
Stolen car, right?

02:35.889 --> 02:38.859
Means our thief wanted property,
not responsibility.

02:38.892 --> 02:41.595
Got to hope that as soon as
he realizes the baby's there

02:41.629 --> 02:44.598
that he wants to return
her somewhere unharmed.

02:44.632 --> 02:47.635
I'll alert safe surrender sites,
fire stations, hospitals.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.237
From Florida to
Texas, thank you.

02:53.641 --> 02:55.276
Hey. Let me through.

02:55.309 --> 02:56.577
This is my house.
That's my husband.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.479
Let me see.
Thank you.

03:01.682 --> 03:02.783
What is wrong
with you?

03:02.816 --> 03:04.752
You left her in the car?!

03:04.785 --> 03:07.521
It was just for a second.
I-I was coming right back out.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.290
Special Agent Pride.

03:09.323 --> 03:11.325
He's in charge.
This is my husband.

03:11.359 --> 03:13.827
Marlon Hart. So what do you
know about where Lou

03:13.861 --> 03:15.829
Not much yet, but it's early.

03:15.863 --> 03:18.666
We got every branch of law
enforcement out there looking.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.501
It's already been,
what, an hour?

03:20.534 --> 03:22.703
Sh-Shouldn't you
know something?!
Mr. Hart,

03:22.736 --> 03:24.805
I know that every second feels
like an eternity,

03:24.838 --> 03:26.740
but the best thing
you can do is try

03:26.774 --> 03:28.542
and stay calm.
JOSH:
Please. Please.

03:28.576 --> 03:30.678
Lou-Lou. She's-she's...

03:30.711 --> 03:33.247
Your daughter.
Believe me, I understand.

03:33.281 --> 03:35.249
I got one of my own.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.754
Excuse me.

03:41.989 --> 03:44.325
Tell me you got something.

03:44.358 --> 03:45.993
BORIN:
Yes and no.

03:46.026 --> 03:48.262
Air support spotted
your stolen vehicle

03:48.296 --> 03:51.999
just under the surface
of the water.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.737
MAN:
I'm circling around
for another pass.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.639
ETA on the divers?

03:58.672 --> 04:00.774
WOMAN: Copy that.
Divers are 30 seconds out.

04:25.666 --> 04:28.068
What do we got?

04:28.101 --> 04:31.605
Car seat's gone.
Seat belt's been cut.

04:31.639 --> 04:34.342
Divers said they didn't find
her in the water, either.

04:38.946 --> 04:41.549
All right, so get on the phones,

04:41.582 --> 04:43.484
reset the agenda.

04:43.517 --> 04:46.820
We're not looking at
a stolen car anymore.

04:46.854 --> 04:48.689
We're talking
about an abduction.

05:06.574 --> 05:08.542
Anything?

05:08.576 --> 05:11.879
Baby's car seat was cut
clean out of the seat belt.

05:13.914 --> 05:17.117
Thinking box cutter or razor.
BORIN:
Hey, guys.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.519
Take a look at this.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.891
Got a tire track.

05:25.058 --> 05:26.059
From the Jeep?

05:27.160 --> 05:28.396
Too deep.

05:28.429 --> 05:29.597
Seems like a bigger vehicle.

05:29.630 --> 05:30.864
We'll make a cast of the tread,

05:30.898 --> 05:32.099
get it to Sebastian.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.803
There was
a second car waiting.

05:35.836 --> 05:39.807
Which means...
more than one person involved.

05:39.840 --> 05:43.511
Or... it was planted
by the abductor.

05:43.544 --> 05:44.845
But regardless...

05:44.878 --> 05:46.747
It was planned
in advance.

05:46.780 --> 05:49.783
Well, less than one percent of
infants are taken by a stranger.

05:49.817 --> 05:51.719
It's usually someone
in the baby's world.

05:51.752 --> 05:55.088
A noncustodial parent,
a friend, a neighbor.

05:55.122 --> 05:58.091
But after the first 48 hours,
the chances of finding Lou-Lou

05:58.125 --> 06:01.161
just decrease significantly.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.930
You guys finish processing
the scene.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.932
Then I'll circle back
to the parents,

06:04.965 --> 06:07.435
get a list of possibles.

06:07.468 --> 06:08.836
Hey, Dwayne.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.704
You mind if
I stay on this?

06:10.738 --> 06:12.973
You know I love
having you around,

06:13.006 --> 06:14.107
but, uh,
jurisdiction-wise...

06:14.141 --> 06:16.376
Well, jurisdiction
can go to hell.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.686
Loretta?

06:25.719 --> 06:28.088
Ah. Saw it on the news.

06:28.121 --> 06:29.990
Came to see
what you knew.

06:30.023 --> 06:33.193
I found the parents,
offered to make 'em some tea.

06:33.226 --> 06:36.029
Just trying
to help.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.566
Anything else you need?

06:38.599 --> 06:40.868
Not at the moment.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.471
Well, as a coroner,

06:43.504 --> 06:46.206
I'm hoping this is the extent
of my involvement.

06:47.941 --> 06:50.911
Probably too upset
to drink it, but...

06:50.944 --> 06:54.715
a little warmth in
the hands always helps.

06:56.049 --> 06:59.620
MARLON:
Look into Cassie Palms.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.088
PRIDE:
Who is she?
JOSH: Our surrogate.

07:01.121 --> 07:03.090
A money-hungry surrogate.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.659
Gay adoption is not
legal in Louisiana,

07:05.693 --> 07:07.895
so we went through an agency
to find a surrogate.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.063
They led us to Cassie.
And we treated Cassie

07:10.097 --> 07:11.899
like a queen. We gave her
everything she needed.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.601
And she needed a lot.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.068
Then right before she gave
birth, she changed her mind

07:15.102 --> 07:17.805
about signing
the pre-birth order,

07:17.838 --> 07:19.907
demanding more money.
But we-we held firm

07:19.940 --> 07:23.010
and... she dropped it.

07:24.678 --> 07:26.580
She, um...

07:26.614 --> 07:28.649
she didn't totally drop it.

07:28.682 --> 07:30.584
Every once
in a while,

07:30.618 --> 07:32.753
for the last few months,

07:32.786 --> 07:35.222
she's called me, and...

07:35.255 --> 07:37.758
I've given her a few dollars.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.693
How much is a few dollars?

07:41.128 --> 07:42.930
I'm not sure exactly.

07:42.963 --> 07:46.099
A thousand. Maybe two.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.636
If you give her some,
then she'll ask for more!

07:48.669 --> 07:50.103
From my account, not from yours.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.271
What is that supposed
to mean?

07:51.304 --> 07:53.040
I didn't think
it was a big deal

07:53.073 --> 07:54.775
to help the woman who
helped us start a family.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.777
Why d... why didn't you tell me?

07:56.810 --> 07:58.145
Because I knew you'd disapprove.

07:58.178 --> 08:01.682
And when was the last time
she asked you for money?

08:01.715 --> 08:03.684
It was about a month ago.

08:03.717 --> 08:05.753
She wanted another $6,000.

08:05.786 --> 08:07.187
Did you give that to her?

08:07.220 --> 08:10.023
No. I-I told her
enough was enough.

08:10.057 --> 08:12.259
She knows where you live?
She knows
everything.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.127
We had her to the house
for dinner.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.597
She-she knows
all about our lives. She knows.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.932
We're already monitoring
your e-mails, your phone,

08:18.966 --> 08:22.736
in case whomever took Lou-Lou
makes a ransom demand.

08:22.770 --> 08:24.237
You've worked cases like this?

08:24.271 --> 08:26.707
A couple.

08:26.740 --> 08:29.610
Don't worry. We got those kids
back safe and sound.

08:31.745 --> 08:34.114
Right now, what we need:

08:34.147 --> 08:36.850
Cassie Palms' current address.

08:47.761 --> 08:50.163
LASALLE:
We're in position, King.

08:51.699 --> 08:55.202
NCIS! Cassie Palms, open up!

08:58.706 --> 09:01.074
Cassie Palms!

09:01.108 --> 09:03.176
Here we go.

09:12.252 --> 09:14.888
Clear.
Clear.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.924
BORIN:
In here, guys. Got something.

09:19.092 --> 09:22.029
Baby clothes,
toys, bottles.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.732
Brand-new.
MAN:
Hey, what's going on in here?

09:27.968 --> 09:29.036
Federal agents.

09:29.937 --> 09:30.904
We got a rabbit!

09:30.938 --> 09:32.072
Stay here. You got her?

09:32.105 --> 09:33.373
Got her.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.008
We need to have a
little conversation.

09:55.228 --> 09:57.898
Come here!

09:57.931 --> 10:01.134
And down goes the couyon.

10:02.970 --> 10:04.872
Josh and Marlon want to
pretend like they're saints.

10:04.905 --> 10:07.908
They're not.
They rented her womb
at a bargain basement rate.

10:07.941 --> 10:11.044
As if I was just some place
for them to stick their baby.

10:11.078 --> 10:12.379
Shut up.
They controlled
her life.

10:12.412 --> 10:14.247
What I ate, where I went.
Shut up.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.083
As far as I'm concerned,
there is nothing wrong with

10:16.116 --> 10:18.151
asking for what's owed to me.
ALL: Shut up!

10:19.286 --> 10:21.088
Where's Baby Lou

10:21.121 --> 10:24.024
With her fathers.

10:25.158 --> 10:26.393
Right?

10:26.426 --> 10:28.095
She was abducted

10:28.128 --> 10:29.229
in front of their home.

10:29.262 --> 10:31.364
We didn't do that.

10:31.398 --> 10:32.966
Why'd you run?

10:33.000 --> 10:34.802
I've had some trouble
with the law.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.103
I see cops, I run.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.138
What about everything we saw
in the bedroom?

10:38.171 --> 10:40.073
Infant clothes

10:40.107 --> 10:41.274
They're for my baby.

10:43.777 --> 10:45.078
I'm three months pregnant.

10:45.112 --> 10:47.014
Having a girl.

10:47.047 --> 10:50.684
That's why I asked Marlon
and Josh for more money.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.187
This one I'm keeping.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.258
NOPD confirms.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.027
Cassie's idiot boyfriend
spent the last two nights

11:00.060 --> 11:01.194
in a drunk tank.

11:01.228 --> 11:03.263
All right, so we start over.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.165
Go back to the parents' lives,

11:05.198 --> 11:06.867
scour for everything.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.201
See what we're missing.

11:08.235 --> 11:09.870
Since it was likely planned,

11:09.903 --> 11:11.271
check everywhere
Josh took the baby

11:11.304 --> 11:13.273
in the hours
leading up to the abduction.

11:13.306 --> 11:15.175
We'll go back to the post office
and car wash.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.010
LASALLE:
And the grocery store.

11:17.044 --> 11:18.211
Borin, you're with me.

11:22.115 --> 11:25.185
BRODY:
Nothing helpful
at the first three places

11:25.218 --> 11:26.253
Josh took the baby.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.320
What's next?

11:27.354 --> 11:29.489
Supermarket,
two blocks up.

11:29.522 --> 11:32.192
You ever consider kids?

11:32.225 --> 11:34.261
Consider?

11:34.294 --> 11:35.729
Yeah.

11:35.763 --> 11:37.731
But living life as an agent...

11:37.765 --> 11:39.800
all you ever see
is things gone bad.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.201
Makes it hard to think about

11:41.234 --> 11:43.136
bringing home
a little bundle of...

11:43.170 --> 11:44.772
Potential things to go bad.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.506
Yeah.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.275
I got to say...

11:48.308 --> 11:50.110
I'm into having
a whole basketball team

11:50.143 --> 11:51.979
full of little Lasalles.

11:52.012 --> 11:54.214
But procreating in my family

11:54.247 --> 11:57.017
is like playing the
gene pool lottery.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.119
My brother Cade,

11:59.152 --> 12:02.022
he's not the only branch off the
family tree with issues.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.824
I get it.

12:03.857 --> 12:06.293
But a Lasalle family
basketball team?

12:06.326 --> 12:08.228
That'd be pretty cool.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.303
WOMAN:
They're regulars.

12:16.336 --> 12:17.504
Such a cute couple.

12:17.537 --> 12:18.972
Michelle jokingly calls them

12:19.006 --> 12:20.307
her power gays.

12:20.340 --> 12:21.909
BRODY:
You both work yesterday?

12:21.942 --> 12:23.276
Mm-hmm.
We did.

12:23.310 --> 12:25.913
Did you see Josh and his
daughter here about 3:30?

12:25.946 --> 12:27.347
I believe I did.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.149
I know I saw 'em
'cause I was just about

12:29.182 --> 12:31.184
to take my break,
and I remember smiling to myself

12:31.218 --> 12:33.020
about him squeezing his kiwi
twice before buying any.

12:33.053 --> 12:35.022
I mean, his husband,
he shops like a frat boy

12:35.055 --> 12:36.156
stocking up for a tailgate.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.390
You think it started here?

12:37.424 --> 12:39.159
We're trying to determine that.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.260
MAN:
Jorge,

12:40.293 --> 12:41.361
got a delivery for you.

12:43.196 --> 12:45.498
I wish I was more help.

12:45.532 --> 12:48.201
I hope the baby's all right.

12:48.235 --> 12:50.370
Thank you.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.372
What about the nanny?

12:52.405 --> 12:54.341
Don't think there is a nanny.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.276
Oh, I just assumed
that's who she was.

12:58.378 --> 12:59.947
She wasn't with Josh,
but the other one.

12:59.980 --> 13:02.115
Marlon.
Yeah, him.

13:02.149 --> 13:03.450
Was it this woman?

13:03.483 --> 13:04.952
Cassie Palms?

13:04.985 --> 13:06.553
No. Pretty Asian girl.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.421
Tallish, about this high.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.559
Asian, mid-30s.

13:12.592 --> 13:16.096
Height between five-two
and five-five.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.865
That case you talked
to the parents about,

13:17.898 --> 13:19.199
infant abduction--

13:19.232 --> 13:20.934
Matthew Johnson case?

13:20.968 --> 13:23.270
Yeah, back in 2010.

13:23.303 --> 13:26.306
And the Armida Marquez abduction
two years before that.

13:26.339 --> 13:29.843
And if you want to take a trip
in the way-back machine,

13:29.877 --> 13:33.113
there's always
the Abigail Borin disappearance.

13:33.146 --> 13:36.283
When I was 13, I wanted
to climb Campbell Hill.

13:36.316 --> 13:39.286
About 1,500 feet
in central Ohio.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.321
Parents weren't too keen
on the idea, so...

13:41.354 --> 13:43.891
I got a few things together,
and then I hitchhiked.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.392
At 13?

13:45.425 --> 13:47.594
Mm-hmm.
Incredibly stupid, I know.

13:47.627 --> 13:49.362
My parents were convinced
I'd been snatched.

13:49.396 --> 13:50.463
Loretta?

13:52.399 --> 13:56.036
After about nine hours,
I was terrified,

13:56.069 --> 13:57.938
found my way to a pay phone.

13:57.971 --> 13:59.973
When I got home...

14:00.007 --> 14:02.242
I'd never seen
my dad like that.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.344
Long time, nine hours.

14:04.377 --> 14:06.880
And these parents...

14:06.914 --> 14:09.249
they're going on 18.

14:09.282 --> 14:12.619
Pride, Sebastian's got something
to show you.

14:12.652 --> 14:14.321
As predicted,

14:14.354 --> 14:16.389
the car being
submerged underwater

14:16.423 --> 14:17.958
wiped clean most
of the DNA evidence.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.392
Yeah, but not all.

14:19.426 --> 14:21.328
So I went through everything,
and after the discovery

14:21.361 --> 14:22.629
of some loose change,
a couple Tic Tacs

14:22.662 --> 14:24.364
and some moldy cashews,

14:24.397 --> 14:26.399
I found this.

14:26.433 --> 14:27.634
It's a strand
of hair, dark.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.636
Consistent with
an Asian woman, mid

14:29.669 --> 14:31.071
Yeah, that's right.
How did...

14:31.104 --> 14:32.405
You're good.
He's so good.

14:32.439 --> 14:33.640
He's good.
Uh, anyway,

14:33.673 --> 14:36.944
we ran the hair through
DNA analysis, and...

14:36.977 --> 14:38.411
ding, ding, ding.

14:38.445 --> 14:40.013
PRIDE:
Chen Han.

14:40.047 --> 14:41.514
You mind if I...?

14:41.548 --> 14:43.016
Oh, no. My computer
is your computer.

14:43.050 --> 14:44.417
Thank you, sir.

14:44.451 --> 14:46.186
Well, it's not actually
your computer.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.155
Just... for this moment,
for your needs, you know.

14:48.188 --> 14:50.958
Don't worry,
I feel you, Sebastian.

14:50.991 --> 14:53.360
Okay, Chen Han.

14:53.393 --> 14:56.029
Naturalized American citizen
born in China.

14:56.063 --> 14:57.430
Studied literature at Yale.

14:57.464 --> 14:59.032
Schmancy.

14:59.066 --> 15:01.501
She abruptly switched
to biomedical engineering

15:01.534 --> 15:03.670
after a trip to Shanghai.

15:03.703 --> 15:05.672
Looks like the last few years,

15:05.705 --> 15:09.042
she's been working at multiple
European biomedical firms,

15:09.076 --> 15:12.179
all of whom have had
their intel compromised

15:12.212 --> 15:13.413
by the Chinese government.

15:13.446 --> 15:16.283
Currently in New Orleans
as an employee

15:16.316 --> 15:19.953
for a Chinese multinational
conglomerate

15:19.987 --> 15:22.122
that has suspected ties to...

15:22.155 --> 15:24.391
People's Liberation Army?

15:24.424 --> 15:26.559
With a dossier like that...

15:26.593 --> 15:28.628
We may be looking for a spy.

15:39.239 --> 15:40.673
JOSH:
I... I don't get it.

15:40.707 --> 15:42.042
Why would a spy
be interested in us?

15:42.075 --> 15:44.177
I'm a supply officer.

15:44.211 --> 15:48.015
Your previous duty assignment
was on a nuclear submarine.

15:48.048 --> 15:51.518
And, Marlon, contractor working
for DARPA, right?

15:53.153 --> 15:55.622
Either one of you could be
targets for espionage.

15:57.324 --> 15:59.692
We found her hair in your Jeep.

15:59.726 --> 16:02.762
And you think...
you think this woman

16:02.795 --> 16:05.598
took our daughter
to get information?

16:05.632 --> 16:07.500
Not unprecedented.

16:07.534 --> 16:10.337
NCIS handled a case
back in the late '90s.

16:10.370 --> 16:11.738
South Africa.

16:11.771 --> 16:14.341
Naval attaché was approached
by a foreign agent,

16:14.374 --> 16:17.010
someone he thought
was a friend...

16:17.044 --> 16:18.645
asking for classified documents.

16:18.678 --> 16:22.115
The diplomat refused, but didn't
report the incident.

16:22.149 --> 16:24.451
A week later,
his 14-year-old daughter

16:24.484 --> 16:27.120
was abducted outside her school.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.190
It wasn't until
we set up a meet,

16:30.223 --> 16:31.758
handed over falsified intel

16:31.791 --> 16:36.029
that we were able to get
the diplomat's daughter back.

16:37.264 --> 16:39.399
Josh,

16:39.432 --> 16:41.201
can you give us
a moment?

16:41.234 --> 16:42.635
What?

16:42.669 --> 16:44.137
Why? Anything
you say to them,

16:44.171 --> 16:45.272
you can say to me.

16:49.176 --> 16:50.810
Marlon...

16:50.843 --> 16:53.046
clock's ticking.

16:56.149 --> 16:58.118
I met her, uh...

16:58.151 --> 17:00.153
I met her a year ago.

17:00.187 --> 17:02.622
Uh, she said her name
was Elena.

17:02.655 --> 17:04.791
I met her at a bookstore.

17:04.824 --> 17:08.728
We both shared a thing
for military history.

17:08.761 --> 17:10.430
Started talking,

17:10.463 --> 17:11.798
got a drink,

17:11.831 --> 17:14.801
and... one thing led to another.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.636
What are you saying?

17:16.669 --> 17:19.038
Marlon, was this an affair?

17:23.276 --> 17:27.247
Before Josh, I was...

17:27.280 --> 17:29.482
I was living on the DL.

17:29.516 --> 17:31.284
Josh, he...

17:31.318 --> 17:34.121
he helped me come out.

17:34.154 --> 17:37.357
And then there was Lou-Lou
in the picture, and...

17:37.390 --> 17:39.326
one day, I woke up...

17:39.359 --> 17:41.828
and suddenly I was a gay father

17:41.861 --> 17:47.134
trying to live life
out and proud.

17:47.167 --> 17:50.370
Chen, she was just a...
she was just a mistake

17:50.403 --> 17:53.740
I-I made because I just felt...
I felt overwhelmed.

17:53.773 --> 17:57.344
Did Chen Han ever talk
to you about your work?

17:57.377 --> 17:59.346
In passing. I...

17:59.379 --> 18:01.448
Just, you know,
"getting to know you" stuff.

18:01.481 --> 18:04.217
I always, always shut it down.

18:04.251 --> 18:05.585
When was the last time
you saw her?

18:05.618 --> 18:07.220
It's been months.

18:09.556 --> 18:12.359
I swear... I swear to you,

18:12.392 --> 18:15.094
she was never in that car.

18:17.297 --> 18:20.300
We need you to set up a meeting
with Chen Han.

18:25.172 --> 18:27.540
I don't see her anywhere.

18:27.574 --> 18:30.177
:
What if she doesn't come?

18:30.210 --> 18:32.245
He's jumping
out of his skin.

18:32.279 --> 18:34.647
Probably how your father felt.

18:36.183 --> 18:37.717
When you went
to climb the mountain.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.219
It's hard to say.

18:39.252 --> 18:41.421
Once he realized
I was in one piece,

18:41.454 --> 18:43.456
he put me on three months
house arrest

18:43.490 --> 18:45.592
and we have not
talked about it since.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.860
He was terrified.

18:47.894 --> 18:49.729
Yeah, but you'd think
after all these years

18:49.762 --> 18:51.631
he could at least joke about it.

18:51.664 --> 18:53.400
You'd think, but...

18:53.433 --> 18:55.702
fathers and daughters.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.304
I got eyes on Chen Han.

18:57.337 --> 18:59.506
She's coming in
the west entrance of the park.

18:59.539 --> 19:00.740
PRIDE:
Here we go.

19:00.773 --> 19:02.342
Hey.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.877
Hey.

19:04.911 --> 19:06.646
How are you, Marlon?

19:06.679 --> 19:09.282
Hey.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.285
You okay?

19:12.319 --> 19:14.321
Of course. Uh...

19:14.354 --> 19:16.489
I just... missed you.

19:16.523 --> 19:18.258
Good, Marlon. Keep her talking.

19:18.291 --> 19:20.260
Brody, Lasalle,
you're good to go.

19:20.293 --> 19:22.562
BRODY: Got it. About to enter
Chen Han's apartment.

19:34.341 --> 19:36.243
BRODY:
Clear.
Clear.

19:38.578 --> 19:40.447
CHEN:
Do you want to get out of here,
go somewhere?

19:40.480 --> 19:42.349
MARLON:
No, no, we don't have to...
go anywhere.

19:42.382 --> 19:44.517
I just... I just wanted to talk.

19:44.551 --> 19:47.254
Talking and drinking
is even better.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.690
I don't want a drink.

19:50.723 --> 19:53.293
Oh, come on.

19:53.326 --> 19:54.527
Baby Lou-Lou isn't here.

19:54.561 --> 19:55.895
What do you have?

19:55.928 --> 19:58.365
Laptop, no password
protection at all.

19:58.398 --> 20:00.233
Browser's filled
with social media

20:00.267 --> 20:01.568
and home decorating sites.

20:01.601 --> 20:03.403
Hard drive's got
a thousand photos

20:03.436 --> 20:07.006
of what has to be the world's
most boring trip to Cabo.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.309
Some spy.

20:09.342 --> 20:11.544
We got this wrong?

20:11.578 --> 20:14.614
You, uh, remember some of the
questions you were asking me?

20:14.647 --> 20:16.316
About work?

20:16.349 --> 20:17.484
What if I told you?

20:17.517 --> 20:19.886
Tell me what?
Everything.

20:19.919 --> 20:21.254
My-my work for DARPA.

20:21.288 --> 20:23.556
Biochemical engineering.

20:23.590 --> 20:25.358
No, no, no, no, that's too soon.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.928
Actually, I think
I have to go, Marlon.

20:28.961 --> 20:31.331
Just give me my daughter.
I-I can get it.
Your daughter?

20:31.364 --> 20:32.799
Okay, we got
to get out there.

20:32.832 --> 20:34.601
I don't know what
you're talking about.

20:34.634 --> 20:36.303
Marlon?
Where is my daughter?!

20:36.336 --> 20:38.671
Tell me, where is she?
Where is she?!

20:38.705 --> 20:40.840
Tell me, where is she?!
Marlon. Marlon.

20:40.873 --> 20:42.409
Let her go.

20:42.442 --> 20:43.776
Hands behind your back.

20:46.813 --> 20:48.348
Sebastian,
what you working on?

20:48.381 --> 20:49.482
SSL.

20:49.516 --> 20:50.883
SSL?

20:50.917 --> 20:52.719
Secure Sockets Layer.
Footage downloaded

20:52.752 --> 20:54.020
to an encrypted hard drive

20:54.053 --> 20:55.722
from Chen Han's computer.

20:55.755 --> 20:58.425
You're a hacker now?
Where's Patton?

20:58.458 --> 21:00.493
Aruba.
Oh.

21:00.527 --> 21:01.728
Well, how are you doing?

21:01.761 --> 21:04.331
Good.
Good?

21:04.364 --> 21:07.400
Good. Fine. Locked in.

21:08.568 --> 21:11.037
It's a little
monosyllabic for me.

21:11.070 --> 21:13.773
Sorry. It's just, uh, baby...
Missing baby.

21:13.806 --> 21:17.377
Gone for 35 hours,
15 minutes and...

21:17.410 --> 21:19.346
11 seconds,
12 seconds,

21:19.379 --> 21:22.315
13 seconds. I'm just
trying to stay focused

21:22.349 --> 21:24.050
and simple and on task

21:24.083 --> 21:26.719
and just...
nothing off-topic.

21:26.753 --> 21:29.055
I don't know.

21:29.088 --> 21:31.924
A little Lund levity
might lighten the load.

21:31.958 --> 21:33.926
Five Ls,
one sentence.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.362
See how I did that?

21:36.629 --> 21:38.398
Has anyone ever
told you that you

21:38.431 --> 21:40.367
bear a striking
resemblance to Gandalf?

21:40.400 --> 21:42.902
Not in the physical appearance,
per se, but more the

21:42.935 --> 21:44.404
prophetic, sage wisdom.

21:44.437 --> 21:45.872
And he's back.

21:45.905 --> 21:48.375
Okay, so apparently

21:48.408 --> 21:50.710
the Chinese government
doesn't let their own operatives

21:50.743 --> 21:53.079
access acquired intel
once they've uploaded it

21:53.112 --> 21:56.349
to one of these
encrypted hard drives.

21:56.383 --> 21:59.419
I just need to figure out some
way that I can get inside.

22:00.853 --> 22:03.390
We got data.

22:03.423 --> 22:05.358
I got it.
Way to go.

22:05.392 --> 22:06.493
I got it.

22:06.526 --> 22:08.428
All right, catch phrase.

22:08.461 --> 22:09.896
Super-Yahtzee.
Thank you.

22:09.929 --> 22:12.565
I don't know anything
about Marlon's baby.

22:12.599 --> 22:15.802
And I'm tired
of repeating myself.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.804
Well, I'll stop asking questions

22:17.837 --> 22:19.806
when you start
answering honestly.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.708
Oh, I don't
have to answer you at all.

22:21.741 --> 22:24.076
You're right.
You can walk out.

22:24.110 --> 22:27.480
You might even get as far as two
blocks before you got grabbed.

22:27.514 --> 22:29.749
Grabbed

22:29.782 --> 22:32.785
CIA. DIA. NSA.

22:34.487 --> 22:36.556
What interest would
they have in me?

22:36.589 --> 22:38.591
Hold that thought.

22:43.162 --> 22:45.164
It's illegal to take pictures

22:45.197 --> 22:46.899
of palm trees and beaches?

22:46.933 --> 22:48.901
It is when there's ciphered data

22:48.935 --> 22:50.937
hidden inside your photos.

22:50.970 --> 22:53.406
Security
through obscurity.

22:53.440 --> 22:55.508
Beautiful sunset...

22:55.542 --> 22:58.745
once decrypted...

22:58.778 --> 23:01.414
contains schematics for unmanned

23:01.448 --> 23:03.416
antisubmarine vessels.

23:05.051 --> 23:06.819
Long-range
missiles specs.

23:06.853 --> 23:09.489
Highly classified
and highly valuable

23:09.522 --> 23:11.458
to the Chinese government.

23:11.491 --> 23:13.760
We already found your e-mails
where you sent all this

23:13.793 --> 23:15.762
back to your
handlers in China.

23:15.795 --> 23:17.797
Busy girl.

23:19.499 --> 23:22.034
Now, I got two
phone calls I can make.

23:22.068 --> 23:23.870
First...

23:23.903 --> 23:26.439
gets you a one-way ticket home.

23:26.473 --> 23:27.707
Second...

23:27.740 --> 23:29.509
sends you to Guantanamo.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.212
They got beaches there.

23:33.245 --> 23:36.015
Not so much with the palm trees.

23:37.484 --> 23:39.552
Tell me how your hair

23:39.586 --> 23:41.588
got inside Marlon's car.

23:43.556 --> 23:47.126
My handlers wouldn't accept
that Marlon shut me out.

23:47.159 --> 23:50.597
They wanted me to keep
working him, so...

23:50.630 --> 23:52.699
I broke into his car
a few weeks ago

23:52.732 --> 23:54.601
to try to plant
a listening device,

23:54.634 --> 23:56.603
but was interrupted.

23:56.636 --> 23:59.806
Lot of pressure
to find a new way in.

23:59.839 --> 24:02.742
New way?

24:02.775 --> 24:05.077
Like abducting their baby?

24:05.111 --> 24:08.114
I don't know
where the baby is.

24:08.147 --> 24:10.583
But I might have
something that'll help.

24:10.617 --> 24:11.784
Something?

24:11.818 --> 24:13.520
A surveillance camera

24:13.553 --> 24:15.087
with a view of Marlon's house.

24:15.121 --> 24:17.123
Placed it there
months ago.

24:17.156 --> 24:19.826
You send me home...

24:19.859 --> 24:21.861
and I'll tell you
where you can find it.

24:25.932 --> 24:27.767
This is off
Chen Han's camera.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.936
Picked up every move
Josh and Marlon made.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.271
What about on the day
of Lou

24:32.304 --> 24:35.007
No. Moving van obscured
the view, but we did get

24:35.041 --> 24:36.509
four screen captures
of four random

24:36.543 --> 24:38.110
days over the last two months.

24:38.144 --> 24:39.646
Got the same white truck--

24:39.679 --> 24:41.514
it was parked
on the street all four days.

24:41.548 --> 24:44.283
We blew up one of the photos
to get a view of the tire.

24:44.316 --> 24:45.985
The tracks match
the set we found

24:46.018 --> 24:47.620
near Josh's abandoned car
by the river?

24:47.654 --> 24:49.556
Yes, and take a look at this.

24:49.589 --> 24:51.991
Logo on the
driver's-side door.

24:52.024 --> 24:53.660
Acquistapace--

24:53.693 --> 24:56.529
supermarket where Josh
had just come from.

24:56.563 --> 24:57.830
You talk to anyone?

24:57.864 --> 24:59.198
Yes.
Anyone
suspicious?

24:59.231 --> 25:00.900
Not really.
I'm way ahead of you.

25:00.933 --> 25:02.869
Just talked
to the store's manager.

25:02.902 --> 25:05.672
Of all the employees
with access to the truck,

25:05.705 --> 25:07.574
only one didn't show
up for work today.

25:07.607 --> 25:10.910
In fact, he left early
yesterday afternoon.

25:10.943 --> 25:12.545
Jorge Gomez.

25:12.579 --> 25:14.146
The guy we spoke with yesterday.

25:15.948 --> 25:18.785
Let's roll.

25:23.222 --> 25:24.924
Back door.
Got it.

25:37.069 --> 25:39.071
We got an open door.

25:48.147 --> 25:49.849
Jorge Gomez.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.550
NCIS.

25:59.091 --> 26:00.359
Suspect's down.

26:00.392 --> 26:02.595
Entering.

26:20.747 --> 26:22.248
No Lou

26:22.281 --> 26:24.751
Looks like our best lead
to finding Lucy...

26:24.784 --> 26:26.753
Is a dead end.

26:30.256 --> 26:31.257
48 hours.

26:48.374 --> 26:49.375
Where we at?

26:49.408 --> 26:50.409
No sign of forced entry.

26:50.442 --> 26:53.045
Suggests Gomez knew his killer.

26:53.079 --> 26:54.781
Couple of brews here.

26:56.816 --> 26:58.250
Looks like things
started off friendly.

26:58.284 --> 27:00.753
Yeah, didn't
end that way.
Cause of death?

27:00.787 --> 27:02.321
Judging by the contusions
on his skull,

27:02.354 --> 27:04.023
I'd say blunt force trauma.

27:04.056 --> 27:06.058
But Jorge didn't go down
without a fight.

27:06.092 --> 27:08.127
Defensive wounds
on both arms.

27:10.062 --> 27:11.030
Hopefully he's got
a piece of

27:11.063 --> 27:12.164
the killer
under his fingernails,

27:12.198 --> 27:14.333
'cause whoever did this to Jorge

27:14.366 --> 27:16.368
is our best lead to Lou-Lou.

27:18.170 --> 27:19.772
Hey, Josh.

27:21.073 --> 27:22.775
Marlon's not here?

27:24.110 --> 27:26.112
We both...

27:26.145 --> 27:27.980
needed a little space.

27:29.248 --> 27:31.450
You must think we're
terrible parents.

27:31.483 --> 27:34.053
Nobody's perfect.

27:34.086 --> 27:36.889
One us is having
an affair, and the other one

27:36.923 --> 27:39.158
leaves his child in the
car for someone to take.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.895
What the hell was I thinking?

27:42.929 --> 27:45.031
Imagine you weren't.

27:48.367 --> 27:50.169
Lou

27:50.202 --> 27:52.972
Guessing, uh,

27:53.005 --> 27:55.942
Lou-Lou just gave up
her afternoon nap?

27:58.210 --> 28:01.213
Probably pretty tired,
taking care of her all day.

28:01.247 --> 28:03.983
How old are yours?

28:04.016 --> 28:06.052
Oh, I just got the one.

28:06.085 --> 28:07.720
Laurel Anne.

28:07.754 --> 28:10.056
She's, uh...

28:10.089 --> 28:12.158
There.

28:12.191 --> 28:13.826
She's in college now.

28:13.860 --> 28:15.027
She's beautiful.

28:15.061 --> 28:17.163
Yeah, yeah.

28:17.196 --> 28:19.198
When she was a baby,

28:19.231 --> 28:21.333
she loved the rain.

28:21.367 --> 28:24.236
One night, I took her outside
during a cloud burst.

28:24.270 --> 28:26.072
Next morning,

28:26.105 --> 28:29.108
Laurel woke up with croup.

28:30.943 --> 28:32.912
Could barely catch her breath.

28:34.213 --> 28:37.116
God knows I stopped
breathing myself.

28:37.149 --> 28:39.318
Terrifying.

28:39.351 --> 28:42.922
Yeah. Her mother called 911,
I took Laurel,

28:42.955 --> 28:46.425
threw her in a hot shower,
pj's and all.

28:46.458 --> 28:49.028
Steam opened up
her lungs, and, uh,

28:49.061 --> 28:51.964
by the time the paramedics
got there, it was all over.

28:51.998 --> 28:54.400
That's lucky.

28:54.433 --> 28:56.002
Yeah, we were.

28:58.337 --> 29:00.940
And if we're not?

29:00.973 --> 29:03.776
We're gonna do everything
in our power

29:03.810 --> 29:06.112
to make sure
that's not the case.

29:06.145 --> 29:07.179
King.

29:07.213 --> 29:08.815
I need to borrow you.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.351
Excuse me.

29:14.520 --> 29:17.223
Any leads on Gomez?
No criminal history.

29:17.256 --> 29:19.491
Squeaky clean.
Guy lived modestly,
paycheck to paycheck.

29:19.525 --> 29:22.028
$220 in his
checking account.

29:22.061 --> 29:24.964
Rules out any connection
to a baby smuggling ring.

29:24.997 --> 29:28.200
And none of his neighbors
have seen Jorge with a baby.

29:28.234 --> 29:31.537
Okay, so then how's Jorge

29:31.570 --> 29:33.205
connected to this abduction,

29:33.239 --> 29:35.074
and where the
hell is the baby?

29:35.107 --> 29:36.375
BORIN:
Hey, guys, I
got something

29:36.408 --> 29:38.277
in here.

29:38.310 --> 29:42.314
I have been digging around
in Jorge's iCloud,

29:42.348 --> 29:44.316
and I found this draft letter.

29:44.350 --> 29:46.152
It's a character reference
for a potential adoption.

29:46.185 --> 29:49.388
Couple named Phil and Anne.
Unfortunately, no last names.

29:50.890 --> 29:52.158
Sebastian.

29:52.191 --> 29:53.993
He got a hit on the DNA.

29:54.026 --> 29:56.528
I got it. Start calling
adoption agencies

29:56.562 --> 29:58.030
and the parish registrar.

29:58.064 --> 30:00.299
Need to identify
this Phil and Anne.

30:03.369 --> 30:05.304
All right, just to warn you,
I know this case

30:05.337 --> 30:08.174
is ultra time-sensitive, but
I'm trying to remain in STSM,

30:08.207 --> 30:10.009
which is Standard
Time-Sensitive Mode.

30:10.042 --> 30:11.310
Might seem like it's
at cross-purposes,

30:11.343 --> 30:13.012
but I'm getting results.

30:13.045 --> 30:15.114
Whatever works, bud.
Okay, so Loretta

30:15.147 --> 30:16.916
was able to retrieve
enough tissue

30:16.949 --> 30:18.918
from under Jorge Gomez's
fingernails to run a search.

30:18.951 --> 30:20.252
And you got a hit?
I did.

30:20.286 --> 30:21.954
Skin particles.

30:21.988 --> 30:23.856
They identify a suspect?
No, nothing

30:23.890 --> 30:25.925
on CODIS or any other
relevant database, but along

30:25.958 --> 30:28.928
with the skin, I did get a hit
on something entirely nonhuman.

30:28.961 --> 30:30.897
We're talking Metazoa.
See, the animal kingdom

30:30.930 --> 30:32.364
is a veritable
rainbow of DNA.

30:32.398 --> 30:34.867
You got your canines,
your felines, your bovines,

30:34.901 --> 30:36.368
your gallines, your elapines--

30:36.402 --> 30:38.370
you got to watch
out for them.

30:38.404 --> 30:40.072
Elapines are poisonous snakes.

30:40.106 --> 30:42.141
I'll catalogue that for later.

30:42.174 --> 30:44.010
This is, uh,
bovine DNA,

30:44.043 --> 30:47.179
with trace amounts of E. coli,
salmonella and listeria.

30:47.213 --> 30:51.117
Jorge's killer and the likely
abductor of Baby Lou...

30:51.150 --> 30:53.285
Works with meat. But not
just any kind of meat.

30:53.319 --> 30:55.454
I found elevated
levels of sodium offset

30:55.487 --> 30:57.256
by very low levels
of blood proteins

30:57.289 --> 30:59.358
and almost no fat cells.

30:59.391 --> 31:00.659
Wherever they're
processing this meat,

31:00.692 --> 31:02.294
they answer
to a higher authority.

31:02.328 --> 31:03.996
What are you trying to tell me?

31:04.030 --> 31:05.497
Meat's kosher.

31:06.532 --> 31:08.200
Question is:

31:08.234 --> 31:12.071
Who supplies kosher meat
to Acquistapace?

31:12.104 --> 31:13.672
Yes, I supply Acquistapace,
but I promise you

31:13.705 --> 31:15.341
I got no use for a baby.

31:15.374 --> 31:17.376
I got four kids
and two ex-wives.

31:17.409 --> 31:18.677
Where were you
two days ago?

31:18.710 --> 31:21.013
Where I always am--
amongst the meat.

31:21.047 --> 31:23.149
I got six employees
who'll tell you the same.

31:23.182 --> 31:24.516
Who does your deliveries?

31:24.550 --> 31:27.019
I got two different guys
who bring it over in trucks

31:27.053 --> 31:28.988
we lease from the supermarket's
corporate offices.

31:29.021 --> 31:31.390
Don't ask. Insurance nightmare.

31:31.423 --> 31:33.292
And who made the delivery
on Thursday?

31:33.325 --> 31:35.094
Yeah. Phil.

31:36.062 --> 31:37.329
Phil who?

31:37.363 --> 31:39.165
Burke. Why?

31:39.198 --> 31:40.332
Where's Phil now?

31:40.366 --> 31:42.634
Let me check.

31:50.442 --> 31:53.445
Pride, truck's here.
Manager said

31:53.479 --> 31:55.414
Phil Burke was loading
at the meat locker.

31:55.447 --> 31:57.416
We're here.

31:57.449 --> 31:59.618
Phil Burke submitted numerous
applications for adoption

31:59.651 --> 32:02.288
with his wife, Anne,
all of which were rejected.

32:02.321 --> 32:06.425
So Phil could've run into Josh
and Baby Lou multiple times

32:06.458 --> 32:08.627
when he was dropping off.

32:15.234 --> 32:17.436
Phil Burke?

32:18.670 --> 32:20.372
NCIS.

32:21.373 --> 32:22.574
Hey.

32:22.608 --> 32:23.575
Easy.

32:23.609 --> 32:25.144
Hands
on your head.

32:25.177 --> 32:26.312
Get 'em up.

32:26.345 --> 32:27.713
Where is she?

32:29.415 --> 32:30.983
Where's Lou

32:33.019 --> 32:35.321
You're not gonna find her.

32:35.354 --> 32:37.023
Where's Lou

32:37.056 --> 32:40.192
She's long gone.

32:52.504 --> 32:54.673
You're facing
kidnapping charges, Phil.

32:54.706 --> 32:57.376
Life in prison without
the possibility of parole.

32:57.409 --> 33:02.014
But if you cooperate with us,
we can work something out.

33:02.048 --> 33:04.250
Understand?

33:06.218 --> 33:08.654
We just need the baby.

33:14.826 --> 33:17.096
We need to talk.

33:22.068 --> 33:23.502
So we went and
searched the house.

33:23.535 --> 33:25.037
The wife's drawers
were half empty.

33:25.071 --> 33:26.538
Looks like she left in a hurry.

33:26.572 --> 33:27.806
Dumped their financials.

33:27.839 --> 33:29.741
They emptied their bank accounts
two days ago.

33:29.775 --> 33:30.809
$1,500 withdrawal.

33:30.842 --> 33:32.411
Someone's going on the run.

33:32.444 --> 33:34.580
We also
found these.

33:34.613 --> 33:36.248
Prescriptions for the wife.

33:36.282 --> 33:38.717
Antidepressants,
mood stabilizers,

33:38.750 --> 33:40.052
sleeping pills.

33:40.086 --> 33:43.255
Looks like Anne
was struggling.

33:43.289 --> 33:45.591
Yeah, and we think we know why.

33:54.866 --> 33:57.669
Most people think

33:57.703 --> 34:00.706
fatherhood begins
at birth.

34:02.674 --> 34:06.078
The moment...

34:06.112 --> 34:09.081
I heard
my daughter's heartbeat

34:09.115 --> 34:11.817
on the ultrasound,

34:11.850 --> 34:16.088
she was instantly
my whole world.

34:16.122 --> 34:19.091
My first primal thought was,

34:19.125 --> 34:23.495
"I will do everything
in my power to protect her."

34:23.529 --> 34:25.764
And I can't even... imagine

34:25.797 --> 34:30.169
how devastating it must be
when even everything

34:30.202 --> 34:32.571
isn't enough.

34:44.616 --> 34:47.353
Brystal Ellen Burke.

34:47.386 --> 34:52.258
She was named after
Annie's mother.

34:52.291 --> 34:54.593
SIDS, right?

34:58.397 --> 35:02.368
And when we lost the baby...

35:02.401 --> 35:05.571
Annie just...

35:05.604 --> 35:07.539
shut down.

35:07.573 --> 35:09.241
Stopped eating,

35:09.275 --> 35:11.143
sleeping.

35:12.611 --> 35:15.881
Living.

35:15.914 --> 35:18.417
And I would go to
work every day,

35:18.450 --> 35:21.887
not sure what kind of state
she would be in when I got home.

35:21.920 --> 35:23.889
So you applied for adoption.

35:23.922 --> 35:26.325
We never made it past
the home visits.

35:28.194 --> 35:30.396
Each time, the caseworkers
would say the same thing.

35:30.429 --> 35:33.565
You know,
just give it more time.

35:33.599 --> 35:36.668
Heal first.

35:36.702 --> 35:40.339
But the only way
that Annie was going to heal

35:40.372 --> 35:42.641
was to get another baby.

35:42.674 --> 35:44.376
Just Annie?

35:46.745 --> 35:49.381
You stole a baby, Phil.

35:51.583 --> 35:54.853
You killed a man.

35:56.355 --> 35:59.258
I just thought
I could fix everything.

35:59.291 --> 36:03.495
I never meant for
anybody to get hurt.

36:03.529 --> 36:06.565
Not those-those fathers.

36:06.598 --> 36:09.601
Uh... Jorge.

36:11.603 --> 36:15.607
I mean, he-he was a...
he was a good friend.

36:15.641 --> 36:18.210
He knew Annie and
I's story and...

36:18.244 --> 36:22.814
knew how desperate I was.

36:26.618 --> 36:28.587
So when you questioned him,
he, uh...

36:28.620 --> 36:30.589
he asked me
to come to his house.

36:30.622 --> 36:34.960
He-he asked me
if I took the baby.

36:34.993 --> 36:39.298
And I just... I...

36:39.331 --> 36:41.967
I lost it. I...

36:42.000 --> 36:44.703
We fought and...

36:45.737 --> 36:48.540
Well, you know how it ended.

36:48.574 --> 36:50.976
I do, Phil.

36:55.046 --> 36:57.349
Where are they?

37:05.324 --> 37:07.326
Take the back.

37:07.359 --> 37:09.528
Back, Chris.

37:59.511 --> 38:01.880
Let me talk to her.

38:08.119 --> 38:10.288
Anne.

38:14.560 --> 38:15.794
Who are you?

38:16.828 --> 38:19.398
NCIS.

38:19.431 --> 38:21.867
Special Agent Dwayne Pride.

38:21.900 --> 38:25.103
Your husband told me
where to find you.

38:25.136 --> 38:27.005
Why?

38:27.038 --> 38:28.874
Where's Phil?

38:30.876 --> 38:32.878
He's at the squad room.

38:35.080 --> 38:38.049
He sent us to...

38:38.083 --> 38:41.620
make sure that you and the baby
were safe and sound.

38:44.456 --> 38:46.458
Phil sent you here?

38:47.493 --> 38:50.128
For Baby Lou-Lou.

38:50.161 --> 38:52.564
Lou

38:52.598 --> 38:54.966
This is Julia.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.935
We adopted her.

38:56.968 --> 38:59.104
Did you sign papers?

39:01.139 --> 39:03.642
Go to an office
to receive the baby?

39:05.477 --> 39:07.913
No.

39:07.946 --> 39:11.450
He said our application
finally went through.

39:11.483 --> 39:13.652
Told me we were moving.

39:13.685 --> 39:15.921
For a fresh start.

39:15.954 --> 39:19.090
But he was gonna
work for a few weeks,

39:19.124 --> 39:21.527
finish up the month.

39:23.762 --> 39:26.398
Is...

39:26.432 --> 39:28.567
is that not true?

39:28.600 --> 39:31.136
No.

39:33.772 --> 39:36.842
Baby Lou-Lou was stolen.

39:42.681 --> 39:45.517
Please.

39:45.551 --> 39:48.754
Just one more minute.

39:58.997 --> 40:02.634
Let me have her.
Let me have her. Okay. Okay.

40:04.703 --> 40:07.539
Okay. Okay. Shh, shh...

40:15.213 --> 40:18.717
You like that watch?
That's my watch right there.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.786
Hey. How's she doing?

40:20.819 --> 40:23.021
A little gassy
but, uh,

40:23.054 --> 40:25.023
otherwise
in good spirits.

40:26.558 --> 40:28.794
Loose ends all tied up?

40:28.827 --> 40:30.796
Yeah, federal marshals
took Phil into custody.

40:30.829 --> 40:33.499
He's facing kidnapping
and murder charges.

40:33.532 --> 40:35.701
And the wife?

40:35.734 --> 40:37.703
She believed her husband, so...

40:37.736 --> 40:39.938
hopefully the judge
will take it easy on her.

40:39.971 --> 40:42.240
* We will all be born again

40:42.273 --> 40:44.242
Look
who's here.

40:44.275 --> 40:46.878
JOSH :
Hey.

40:46.912 --> 40:48.780
Hey, kiddo. Look.

40:48.814 --> 40:51.116
Look what I got
for you. Oh!

40:51.149 --> 40:52.951
:
Oh!

40:54.753 --> 40:57.589
Oh.

40:57.623 --> 40:59.891
Good luck,
fellas.

40:59.925 --> 41:02.528
Thank you.

41:03.294 --> 41:07.265
* We are beautiful

41:07.298 --> 41:09.568
We got to do...

41:09.601 --> 41:12.070
Better by each other.

41:12.103 --> 41:17.576
* We are beautiful,
we are beautiful *

41:17.609 --> 41:20.979
Now there's something
I got to do.

41:21.012 --> 41:23.081
What's that?

41:23.114 --> 41:25.584
Call my dad.

41:25.617 --> 41:28.620
I owe him
a long overdue apology.

41:28.654 --> 41:32.023
* We are beautiful,
we are beautiful. *
