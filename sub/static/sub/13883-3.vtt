01:06.800 --> 01:10.679
Three million years from Earth,
the mining ship Red Dwarf,

01:10.760 --> 01:14.116
Its crew; Dave Lister,
the last human being alive;

01:14.200 --> 01:17.192
Arnold Rimmer,
a hologram of his dead bunkmate;

01:17.280 --> 01:20.511
and a creature who evolved
from the ship's cat, Message ends,

01:23.160 --> 01:29.508
Additional; supplies are plentiful, We have
enough food and drink to last 30,000 years,

01:29.600 --> 01:33.309
although we have run out of Shake 'n ' Vac,

01:35.560 --> 01:37.551
Additional additional,

01:37.640 --> 01:42.350
Last week, we found a planet
with a breathable atmosphere,

02:04.840 --> 02:08.719
We're grooving tonight,
Ahead, groove factor five, Yeah!

02:14.720 --> 02:16.915
Hang on, everybody. Hang on!

02:19.920 --> 02:22.388
The sausages are done.

02:22.480 --> 02:26.632
It's the business,
It's nice to get out, stretch your cables,

02:26.720 --> 02:30.395
I don't understand.
I've had so much to drink

02:30.480 --> 02:32.550
and it hasn't even afflicted me.

02:32.640 --> 02:36.030
- Why are you dancing, then?
- You call that dancing?

02:36.120 --> 02:38.998
I've seen people on fire move better!

02:39.080 --> 02:43.676
- We'd better go, The moons are setting,
- OK, then, a toast.

02:43.760 --> 02:47.594
Gentlemen, and skutters,
we are gathered here today

02:47.680 --> 02:50.831
to celebrate the anniversary
of Arnold Rimmer's death.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.195
Right on, baby!

02:53.280 --> 02:58.593
And for this very special occasion,
I have baked a cake.

02:58.680 --> 03:01.433
- What's that?
- It's shaped like a spanner.

03:01.520 --> 03:04.159
- He was a technician.
- That's very apt,

03:04.240 --> 03:08.233
If he'd been a postman,
it'd be an envelope, I suppose?

03:08.320 --> 03:11.198
Gordon Bennet!
It's lucky he's not a gynaecologist,

03:12.600 --> 03:14.397
To me!

03:15.880 --> 03:19.236
# Happy deathday to you

03:19.320 --> 03:23.313
Happy deathday to you

03:23.400 --> 03:28.599
# Happy deathday, dear Rimmer

03:28.680 --> 03:34.232
# Happy deathday to you #

03:52.840 --> 03:57.960
# Show me the way to go home

03:58.040 --> 04:03.478
# I'm tired and I want to go to bed... #

04:05.400 --> 04:08.949
Are you all right to drive?
Yeah.

04:10.680 --> 04:16.516
# I had a little drink about an hour ago

04:16.600 --> 04:22.470
# To celebrate Rimmer's death #

04:28.240 --> 04:30.231
What time is it?

04:37.440 --> 04:41.752
- Saturday.
- Is that the best you can do?

04:41.840 --> 04:45.992
There are some numbers,
but they could be anything.

04:46.080 --> 04:48.514
Do you know what I fancy?

04:48.600 --> 04:52.912
A big fat woman with thighs the size of a hippo's.

04:53.000 --> 04:59.314
No, I want a triple fried egg butty
with chilli sauce and chutney.

05:02.280 --> 05:04.271
Me, too.

05:05.360 --> 05:08.591
No problem. Nothing's too good
for the deathday boy.

05:08.680 --> 05:11.911
- Correct.
- Hol? Hol?

05:14.920 --> 05:18.913
- Hol, give us something to eat.
- You what? I'm jiggered, man,

05:19.000 --> 05:22.037
- Come on. You don't sleep.
- 'Course I do,

05:22.120 --> 05:27.478
I've got to offline, I can't keep up
my red-hot pace all the time,

05:27.560 --> 05:29.710
I've got to take a breather,

05:30.040 --> 05:35.034
- I want a triple fried egg sandwich...
- With chilli sauce and chutney.

05:35.120 --> 05:38.237
- You what?
- It's state of the art.

05:38.320 --> 05:40.993
It's the state of the floor I'm worried about,

05:42.320 --> 05:44.311
All right, OK,

05:47.720 --> 05:49.472
Trust me.

06:02.200 --> 06:05.158
I feel like I'm having a baby!

06:05.240 --> 06:07.959
- It's good, innit?
- It's incredible.

06:08.040 --> 06:11.476
- Where did you find the recipe?
- I can't remember.

06:11.560 --> 06:14.791
I think it was a book on bacteriological warfare.

06:14.880 --> 06:18.475
It's like a cross between food and bowel surgery.

06:18.560 --> 06:22.235
It's well naughty.
Eat it before the bread dissolves.

06:22.320 --> 06:25.756
I could never invent a sandwich
like this, Lister.

06:25.840 --> 06:28.832
You see, all the ingredients are wrong.

06:28.920 --> 06:31.912
The fried eggs, wrong. The chutney, wrong.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.514
The chilli sauce, all wrong.

06:34.600 --> 06:40.755
But put them together
and somehow it works. It becomes right.

06:41.880 --> 06:45.077
It's you. This sandwich, Lister, is you.

06:45.840 --> 06:48.957
- What are you saying, Rimmer?
- You're wrong, right?

06:49.040 --> 06:51.031
All your ingredients are wrong.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.998
You're slobby. You've got no sense of discipline.

06:54.080 --> 06:59.154
You're the only man to get his money
back from the Odour Eater people.

06:59.240 --> 07:01.800
But people like you. Don't you see?

07:01.880 --> 07:05.316
That's why you're a fried egg,
chilli, chutney sandwich.

07:05.400 --> 07:08.949
Now me, all the ingredients are right.

07:09.040 --> 07:13.511
I'm disciplined. I'm organised.
I'm dedicated to my career.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.591
I've always got a pen.

07:16.360 --> 07:20.399
Result? Total smeghead despised
by everyone except the ship's parrot...

07:20.480 --> 07:23.597
and that's only because we haven't got one.

07:23.680 --> 07:28.231
- Why? Why is that?
- It's because you are a total smeghead.

07:28.320 --> 07:30.754
But I'm not. I'm a goodie.

07:30.840 --> 07:35.789
You've never got time for people.
You're too busy trying to be successful.

07:35.880 --> 07:39.919
It's all midnight revision
and "Up, up, up, lickety-split".

07:40.000 --> 07:45.393
All the time I spent licking up to Todhunter,

07:45.480 --> 07:47.675
even though he's a total gimp?

07:47.760 --> 07:54.677
Captain Hollister? Mr Fat Bastard 2044.
I went out of my way to simp around him.

07:54.760 --> 07:57.035
That's not having time for people.

07:57.120 --> 08:00.476
Do you know how many times I made love?

08:00.560 --> 08:04.712
- No. I don't want to know.
- I want to tell you.

08:04.800 --> 08:08.713
- I don't want to know!
- I'm going to tell you!

08:08.800 --> 08:13.191
You'll wake up in the morning
with your hangover, feeling like death,

08:13.280 --> 08:17.717
you'll walk up to the mirror
and remember and go... "Arghh!"

08:17.800 --> 08:22.078
It's not worth it.
Believe me, you don't want to tell me.

08:22.160 --> 08:24.549
- Once.
- Smeg!

08:25.640 --> 08:27.631
One time only.

08:27.720 --> 08:30.553
You'll want to kill yourself in the morning.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.631
Yvonne McGruder.

08:32.720 --> 08:37.077
A single brief liaison with the ship's
female boxing champion.

08:38.520 --> 08:43.275
March 16th. 7.31 pm to 7.43 pm.

08:43.360 --> 08:46.636
- Please...
- Twelve minutes...

08:46.720 --> 08:50.156
including the time it took to eat the pizza.

08:50.240 --> 08:52.037
Please, Rimmer!

08:52.120 --> 08:56.033
In my entire life, I've spent more time being sick.

08:56.120 --> 08:59.430
So? You haven't met the right girl yet.

08:59.520 --> 09:03.991
No, I haven't, Lister, and some just might say -

09:04.080 --> 09:08.278
given the fact that the human race
no longer exists,

09:08.360 --> 09:12.148
coupled with the fact that I have passed on -

09:12.240 --> 09:16.597
that I'm leaving it a bit on the late side.

09:16.680 --> 09:20.878
Well, you made a decision.
You chose career over personal life.

09:20.960 --> 09:24.350
Yes, I did. Pearls of wisdom there

09:24.440 --> 09:28.479
from Mr Fried Egg Chilli Chutney Sandwich Face.

09:28.560 --> 09:32.439
Well, I'll tell you something, Lister.
I'll tell you something.

09:32.520 --> 09:37.036
I'd trade it all in -
my pips, my long service medals,

09:37.120 --> 09:41.113
my swimming certificates,
my telescope, my shoe-trees.

09:41.200 --> 09:47.036
I'd trade everything in to be loved
and to have been loved.

09:49.480 --> 09:52.153
# I'm a little lamb

09:52.240 --> 09:54.515
# Lost in the wood

09:54.600 --> 09:56.636
# Maybe I could

09:56.720 --> 09:58.756
# Really be good

09:58.840 --> 10:03.072
# With someone to watch over me #

10:05.600 --> 10:08.512
That was going to be our song,

10:08.600 --> 10:12.479
but I never found anyone to share it with,

10:12.560 --> 10:15.358
so now it's just my song.

10:16.600 --> 10:19.717
Another bit of sky. That's a star.

11:17.440 --> 11:20.716
Ah, my foot! I must have slept on it.

11:20.800 --> 11:25.590
You were putting it away last night.
You really fell for my joke.

11:25.680 --> 11:28.319
God, it's agony!

11:28.400 --> 11:31.392
That McGruder gag. Fancy falling for that!

11:32.480 --> 11:36.758
I'll give you my telescope, anything.
Please don't tell anyone.

11:41.240 --> 11:43.231
Have you done that?

11:43.320 --> 11:45.311
When did you do that?

11:45.400 --> 11:48.073
I didn't! I've just woken up with this!

11:50.120 --> 11:53.510
- When did you finish the jigsaw?
- I didn't.

11:53.600 --> 11:56.831
Oi! Who's been messing with my star charts?!

11:56.920 --> 12:01.675
I'm trying to do the comprehensive -
nay, definitive - A-Z of the Universe,

12:01.760 --> 12:04.228
with street names, post offices and everything,

12:04.320 --> 12:07.039
and some git's been fiddling with it,

12:07.120 --> 12:08.792
It's not us.

12:08.960 --> 12:11.997
OK, which one of you chi mpanzees did this?!

12:12.800 --> 12:15.394
Look, there's a logical explanation for everything,

12:15.480 --> 12:18.119
with the possible exception of Jimmy Osmond,

12:19.640 --> 12:22.279
- Who?
- Hang on. Today's Sunday, right?

12:22.360 --> 12:26.353
- So?
- Well, the clocks say Thursday.

12:26.440 --> 12:29.637
My foot says get the person who did this.

12:31.120 --> 12:34.192
Four pages are torn out of me diary.

12:37.200 --> 12:42.115
- We've lost the last four days.
- Did you look behind the fridge?

12:42.200 --> 12:45.033
If you lose something, it's always there.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.791
- Aliens!
- What?

12:47.880 --> 12:49.950
What are you talking about?

12:50.040 --> 12:52.349
It's a well-documented phenomenon.

12:52.440 --> 12:57.434
They give you a mind probe,
erase your memory and put you back.

12:57.520 --> 13:00.080
- OK, aliens came aboard.
- Without question.

13:00.160 --> 13:03.470
- They broke my leg.
- They broke MY leg.

13:03.560 --> 13:06.757
- And then they did a jigsaw,
- Right.

13:07.560 --> 13:10.120
Well, that's cleared that up, then,

13:10.200 --> 13:13.875
Look, you're not thinking alien.
That's what aliens are - alien.

13:13.960 --> 13:19.159
They do things that are... alien.
Maybe this is how they communicate.

13:19.240 --> 13:21.231
By breaking legs?!

13:21.320 --> 13:25.598
- And doing jigsaws?
- Why should they speak the way we do?

13:25.680 --> 13:29.036
- They're aliens.
- OK, Professor, what does it mean?

13:29.120 --> 13:32.237
Maybe... Maybe... OK.

13:32.320 --> 13:38.156
Breaking your leg hurts like hell, OK? "Hell. "

13:38.240 --> 13:41.357
They do it below the knee. "Low. "

13:41.440 --> 13:43.874
"Hell-low. " Get it?

13:45.280 --> 13:48.556
They do it twice. Twice. Two.

13:48.640 --> 13:53.156
"Hell-Low-Two. "
And jigsaw must mean you. "Hello to you. "

13:55.120 --> 13:59.159
I wouldn't like to be around
when one of these suckers is making a speech.

14:01.760 --> 14:06.880
Hang on. Holly, the black box
will have recorded everything, won't it?

14:06.960 --> 14:10.077
Yeah, Hang on, I'll fish it out,

14:11.240 --> 14:16.439
It's gone! It's been half-inched,
Wait a minute, Let me think about this,

14:16.520 --> 14:20.035
It gives off a signal, We can trace it,

14:26.920 --> 14:29.798
It's the gearbox, I'm telling you.

14:30.720 --> 14:34.269
- Nothing yet.
- It's impossible. It could be anywhere.

14:34.360 --> 14:37.352
It's like finding a fart in a jacuzzi.

14:38.640 --> 14:41.279
Look! Down there on that moon.

14:49.880 --> 14:52.474
Are you getting a picture?

14:52.560 --> 14:57.236
Yeah, but the quality's terrible.
It's like watching Spanish television.

14:57.320 --> 15:01.199
Oh, my God!
What the hell is that?

15:01.280 --> 15:03.271
Smegorama!

15:03.360 --> 15:08.070
Er, Holly, start the engines.
Keep her ticking over, yeah? What is it?

15:08.160 --> 15:11.072
A footprint the size of a surfboard.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.151
I don't believe it!

15:13.240 --> 15:17.279
Can you imagine the problems
this guy has getting fashionable shoes?

15:17.360 --> 15:21.273
If it's true what they say about feet,

15:21.360 --> 15:25.353
this guy could go to fancy dress parties
as a petrol pump.

15:25.440 --> 15:27.431
I think you should come back.

15:27.520 --> 15:30.512
They lead round this corner.

15:30.600 --> 15:35.720
So, a huge monster drained our memories
and broke a couple of legs.

15:35.800 --> 15:38.268
Forgive and forget, I say.

15:38.360 --> 15:40.954
This I don't believe!

15:41.040 --> 15:43.190
It's a gravestone.

15:43.280 --> 15:47.319
"To the memory of the memory of Lise Yates. "

15:47.400 --> 15:50.597
- Who's Lise Yates?
- You're not going to believe this,

15:50.680 --> 15:53.194
but I went out with Lise Yates.

15:53.280 --> 15:57.876
It's only shallow.
The black box is buried in the grave.

16:09.080 --> 16:12.914
- Right, it's loaded,
- Well, play it, Sam.

16:16.920 --> 16:18.990
Nice-looking bloke,

16:19.640 --> 16:23.110
I don't know if anyone will ever find this,

16:23.200 --> 16:28.274
but if they do and it's you, Dave,
or you, Arnold, don't ever play it,

16:28.360 --> 16:30.794
Some things are best left buried,

16:31.880 --> 16:35.031
- Why have you frozen hi m?
- You heard him,

16:35.120 --> 16:39.989
- Knows his stuff, that dude,
- Come on, Holly. From Saturday night.

16:40.080 --> 16:43.868
Do you know how many times
I've made love?

16:43.960 --> 16:47.032
Yes, we remember this bit. Spin on!

16:56.680 --> 16:58.671
That many?!

17:01.880 --> 17:04.678
Another bit of sky. A star...

17:15.040 --> 17:20.068
This better be good. I was sleeping,
and sleeping's my third favourite thing.

17:20.160 --> 17:22.276
Waking me at this time...!

17:26.920 --> 17:31.232
- What is this place?
- It's the hologram simulation suite.

17:31.320 --> 17:35.393
- This room creates Rimmer.
- Are we gonna blow it up?

17:35.880 --> 17:40.317
Look, those are his dreams.
That's what he's dreaming right now.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.516
# Maybe I could

17:42.600 --> 17:44.272
# Really be good

17:44.360 --> 17:48.558
# With someone to watch over me #

17:48.640 --> 17:52.315
I'm giving Rimmer the best present
he'll ever get.

17:53.840 --> 17:56.877
- What are you doing?
- Recording me memory.

17:56.960 --> 17:59.190
- Your entire memory?
- Yeah.

17:59.280 --> 18:01.714
Everywhere I've been, everything I've learned.

18:03.360 --> 18:05.351
Right, that's it.

18:06.360 --> 18:08.715
I'm giving Rimmer a love affair.

18:08.800 --> 18:12.315
I'll paste eight months of my memory into his.

18:12.400 --> 18:15.597
Whatever happened to me,
he'll think happened to him.

18:15.680 --> 18:20.231
- You're giving him an old girlfriend?
- I'm going to give him Lise Yates.

18:28.600 --> 18:31.273
God, Dave. I love you so much.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.476
And I love you, Lise.

18:33.560 --> 18:35.551
A few minor adjustments.

18:38.360 --> 18:43.275
- God, Rimmer, I love you so much.
- And I love you, Lise.

18:43.360 --> 18:45.351
Change the voice.

18:47.160 --> 18:50.709
God, Rimmer, I love you so much.

18:50.800 --> 18:53.189
And I love you, Lise.

18:53.280 --> 18:56.989
- That's it.
- He'll think all this happened to him?

18:57.080 --> 18:59.196
Yeah, the whole eight months.

18:59.280 --> 19:01.669
Man, that's a fine present.

19:02.320 --> 19:05.471
He was probably only expecting a tie.

19:35.360 --> 19:37.351
You're in a good mood.

19:38.880 --> 19:41.838
Why not, Listie, when life's so good?

19:41.920 --> 19:43.956
Why is life so good?

19:44.040 --> 19:46.998
You wouldn't understand.
You've never been in love.

19:47.080 --> 19:51.517
- I have!
- Oh, not real love. Not like I have.

19:51.600 --> 19:57.470
Not fireworks in the sky,
rolling naked on the beach kind of love.

19:57.560 --> 20:00.711
- Not like me and Lise.
- So, who's Lise?

20:00.800 --> 20:06.238
Someone who was absolutely nuts about me,
that's all you need to know.

20:06.320 --> 20:09.312
Fine. You keep it to yourself.

20:09.400 --> 20:14.520
All I'm saying is, from now on call me Tiger. Grrr!

20:15.200 --> 20:18.317
An old girlfriend, was she... Tiger?

20:18.400 --> 20:21.949
Ah! What a crazy, crazy, year that was.

20:22.040 --> 20:27.273
The first three months, I was at Saturn Tech
doing a maintenance course.

20:27.360 --> 20:31.273
Then, for absolutely no reason,
I suddenly moved to Liverpool.

20:32.000 --> 20:36.198
I drank too much. I smoked too much.
I became a total slob.

20:36.280 --> 20:40.273
I met Lise. I even started
eating my own toenail clippings.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.868
My tastes in music radically changed.

20:44.960 --> 20:48.589
I stopped adoring Mantovani
and got into Rastabilly Skank.

20:48.680 --> 20:52.559
- Crazy.
- You were in love. You go a bit crazy.

20:52.640 --> 20:55.791
It was weird. I was nuts about her,

20:55.880 --> 20:59.589
- but started treating her really badly.
- No, you didn't!

20:59.680 --> 21:04.196
I did! I gave her some twaddle
about not getting tied down.

21:04.280 --> 21:08.319
But you were young. You wanted to bum around.

21:08.400 --> 21:12.632
- I hate bumming around!
- You're like that when you're young.

21:12.720 --> 21:16.076
I wasn't, so why did I say those things?

21:16.160 --> 21:19.596
She wanted you to have a career.

21:19.680 --> 21:23.719
That's what I wanted,
so why did I finish with her?

21:23.800 --> 21:26.360
Because... you wanted to play the field.

21:26.440 --> 21:29.750
Right. I said I wanted to play the field.

21:29.840 --> 21:34.755
I must have been mad. She was great,
and thought I was great.

21:34.840 --> 21:38.549
Yeah, man, you're right. You were mad.

21:38.640 --> 21:42.269
- She was a lover and a friend.
- And beautiful.

21:42.360 --> 21:44.351
- Gorgeous.
- Great sense of humour.

21:44.440 --> 21:47.716
- Terrific.
- The sex was fantastic.

21:47.800 --> 21:50.394
- Amazing sex.
- Brilliant sex.

21:50.480 --> 21:54.951
- Oh, primo, dynamite sex!
- Fantastic sex! Stupendous sex!

21:55.040 --> 21:58.350
- Lister...
- Brilliant sex!

21:58.440 --> 22:02.194
- Lister, how do you know?
- I'm just having a guess.

22:03.560 --> 22:07.030
No one will ever know

22:07.120 --> 22:11.033
how beautiful the relationship
between me and Lise Yates was.

22:11.120 --> 22:17.639
How could you do this?
It's the most tragic thing I've ever witnessed.

22:18.440 --> 22:20.237
Popcorn?

22:22.680 --> 22:26.719
I'm sorry, man.
I thought I was doing you a favour.

22:26.800 --> 22:32.079
What's this got to do with jigsaws, broken legs
and Godzilla-size footprints, eh?

22:38.280 --> 22:42.239
Right, smegbrain, prepare to die!
I found the letters.

22:42.320 --> 22:45.073
- What letters?
- THE letters.

22:45.160 --> 22:48.869
- What letters?
- The letters Lise Yates sent you.

22:48.960 --> 22:50.837
Oh, smeg!

22:50.920 --> 22:55.835
While she was seeing me,
she was seeing you behind my back.

22:55.920 --> 23:02.234
And to pour salt into the wound,
you took her to the exact same places.

23:02.320 --> 23:06.791
- Rimmer, it's not what it looks like.
- That woman is unbelievable.

23:06.880 --> 23:10.429
We stayed in a hotel and made love six times.

23:10.520 --> 23:15.071
You were in the same hotel
and made love six times, too!

23:15.160 --> 23:19.551
- Listen...
- Twelve times a night? She's sex mad!

23:19.640 --> 23:23.189
- Listen!
- It's a good job you were there.

23:23.280 --> 23:26.158
I'd have been dead within a week.

23:26.240 --> 23:29.437
But it doesn't make sense. She loved me.

23:29.520 --> 23:33.752
- She wasn't seeing us at the same time.
- I've checked the dates.

23:33.840 --> 23:37.389
- She wasn't going out with you at all.
- She...

23:37.480 --> 23:40.040
- What?
- You've never even met her.

23:40.120 --> 23:42.475
That's below feeble!

23:42.560 --> 23:46.872
I gave you eight months of my memory.

23:46.960 --> 23:50.236
- What?
- It was a present.

23:51.800 --> 23:57.432
You gave me eight months
of your memory as a present?

23:58.520 --> 23:59.919
Yeah.

24:01.080 --> 24:06.313
That's why I was an orphan,
even though my parents were alive.

24:07.520 --> 24:10.876
That's why I had my appendix out twice.

24:10.960 --> 24:13.076
I thought you needed it.

24:15.720 --> 24:17.870
You've destroyed me, Lister.

24:17.960 --> 24:24.911
The woman I loved most in the whole
world didn't love me, she loved you.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.831
Rimmer, listen...

24:28.920 --> 24:31.036
Rimmer, listen... Rimmer!

24:31.120 --> 24:32.917
Oh, smeg!

24:36.160 --> 24:39.152
You should have bought him a tie.

24:59.520 --> 25:01.909
Come on, Rimmer. You've experienced love.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.639
It made you more confident, more secure.

25:04.720 --> 25:07.280
- It didn't happen.
- It did happen.

25:07.360 --> 25:13.276
You fell in love in a way I never did.
Nothing can take that away.

25:13.360 --> 25:18.912
That time she stuck her tongue
down my ear. It was your ear.

25:19.000 --> 25:24.472
The woman I loved most in the whole world
had her tongue down your ear.

25:24.560 --> 25:29.793
The most romantic thing I've ever had
down my ear is a baby bud.

25:31.400 --> 25:35.791
Come on, as far as you're concerned
you had a wonderful love affair, yeah?

25:35.880 --> 25:39.555
And for some reason, it all went hideously wrong.

25:39.640 --> 25:44.839
Well, join the club. It's you, me
and everyone else in the world.

25:44.920 --> 25:48.959
- I don't want to feel like this.
- So, you're in pain.

25:49.040 --> 25:52.555
But, Rimmer, if you go
through life without feeling,

25:52.640 --> 25:55.473
never experiencing,
you're no better than a jellyfish,

25:55.560 --> 25:57.869
no better than a bank manager.

25:57.960 --> 26:02.033
I don't want this feeling.
I want my own memory back.

26:02.120 --> 26:08.355
OK. OK. I'll erase the last four days.
Lise Yates will never have happened.

26:08.440 --> 26:12.513
- But you'll know about it.
- Well, I'll erase my memory, too.

26:12.600 --> 26:15.910
- And the Cat's and Holly's.
- Fine, if they agree.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.753
- And the black box?
- I'll destroy it.

26:18.840 --> 26:21.434
- It's indestructible.
- I'll shoot it into space.

26:21.520 --> 26:26.355
- Someone might find it.
- OK. We'll bury it on some planet.

26:33.440 --> 26:36.910
I'm going to drop it! Put it down!

26:40.320 --> 26:44.598
Why does he want a gravestone?
He said he wanted something,

26:44.680 --> 26:46.671
so it didn't, like, disappear.

26:58.280 --> 27:02.592
My foot! It's broken!
Help me find my toes!

27:17.560 --> 27:20.393
OK, that's it.

27:20.480 --> 27:23.631
Let's go and erase our memories.

27:34.520 --> 27:36.317
# It's cold outside

27:36.400 --> 27:38.197
# There's no kind of atmosphere

27:38.280 --> 27:41.636
# I'm all alone, more or less

27:41.720 --> 27:44.837
# Let me fly far away from here

27:44.920 --> 27:47.673
# Fun, fun, fun

27:47.760 --> 27:51.275
# In the sun, sun, sun

27:51.360 --> 27:54.716
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

27:54.800 --> 27:58.076
# Drinking fresh mango juice

27:58.160 --> 28:01.436
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

28:01.520 --> 28:04.193
# Fun, fun, fun

28:04.280 --> 28:07.955
# In the sun, sun, sun

28:08.040 --> 28:10.713
# Fun, fun, fun

28:10.800 --> 28:14.873
# In the sun, sun, sun #

28:15.305 --> 28:21.778
