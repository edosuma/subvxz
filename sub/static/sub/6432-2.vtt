Oh!

10:49.122 --> 10:50.488
Miss, are you all right?

10:50.523 --> 10:52.791
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- It's okay, it's okay.

10:52.825 --> 10:54.692
God, this can't be
happening to me.

10:54.726 --> 10:56.394
Everything's
out of order now.

10:56.428 --> 10:59.463
God, I'm due on 14, and if I'm
late, he's going to fire me.

10:59.497 --> 11:00.597
He's not going
to fire you.

11:00.631 --> 11:01.998
We'll get you there on time,
okay?

11:02.032 --> 11:04.066
Gosh, oh, thank you.
I'll sort it in the elevator.

11:04.101 --> 11:06.302
- Okay. You all good?
- God, thank you.

11:06.337 --> 11:07.337
Oh, wait, sorry.

11:07.371 --> 11:08.471
I need to see
your security badge.

11:08.505 --> 11:12.746
Oh, God, yeah.

Just--no.

Don't--don't--

don't cry.
It's okay.

[Quietly]
It'll be our little secret.

11:42.806 --> 11:43.840
Pretty quiet.

11:43.874 --> 11:46.208
Why doesn't that surprise me?

11:46.243 --> 11:48.911
Uh, you new?

11:48.945 --> 11:50.712
Yeah, I just started
on Tuesday, actually.

- Hey, crybaby.

12:03.899 --> 12:07.101
This isn't 14.

12:07.135 --> 12:09.670
Enough!

12:09.705 --> 12:10.671
Okay, all right.

12:10.706 --> 12:11.672
All right--ow--
with the pulling.

12:20.748 --> 12:24.049
Well, whatever attacked them
was big and green

12:24.084 --> 12:25.884
with enormous claws
and glowing eyes.

12:25.918 --> 12:27.719
- Anything helpful?
- Nah. What about you?

12:27.754 --> 12:29.754
No--I mean,
none of the patients

12:29.788 --> 12:31.155
had been in to see
the dentist yet,

12:31.190 --> 12:33.023
so it wasn't one
of the instruments he used.

12:33.058 --> 12:35.092
None of them drank
from the same water cooler

12:35.127 --> 12:38.695
or read the same magazine
or even used the same pen.

12:38.730 --> 12:41.231
I mean, there's no
cross-contamination at all.

Great, we have a fantastic
list of what this isn't.

12:44.135 --> 12:46.936

any of them ate at the diner?

12:46.971 --> 12:48.037
No.

12:48.072 --> 12:49.405
I mean,
aside from the end result,

12:49.439 --> 12:51.106
there's no connection
to the people at the diner.

12:51.141 --> 12:56.211
Look, the folks at the diner
saw a big, red scary thing.

12:56.246 --> 12:57.212

Please don't.

with the claws
and the eyes and--

13:04.887 --> 13:06.555
I think there's something
about the tentacles.

Okay, okay.

All right, fine.

We don't know
what the artifact is,

that it's spreading.

someone died.

Okay,
I'm going to call Leena.

if anyone's reported

how tempting it is,

you go down that road,

like one for us.

have tenta--

- Don't.
- tive.

if it was the same tentative.

- What kind of evil?

from the astrolabe?

What kind of evil exactly?

19:58.972 --> 20:01.773
I've been told

if you die too!

Claudia, look at me!

20:57.195 --> 20:58.328
I've done the research.

20:58.363 --> 21:00.797
I've used every resource
at my disposal.

21:00.832 --> 21:03.166
Nowhere, nowhere does it
describe this evil.

21:03.201 --> 21:05.769
Is it possible that--

21:05.804 --> 21:07.438
could this evil be triggered
by a resurrection?

21:07.472 --> 21:09.340
By bringing somebody back
to life?

21:09.374 --> 21:10.975
A resurrection?
Why?

21:11.009 --> 21:12.476
It is possible,
isn't it?

21:12.511 --> 21:16.280
Anything's possible.

21:16.314 --> 21:17.715
Claudia,
don't look away!

21:17.749 --> 21:19.283
That's it,
that's right.

21:19.317 --> 21:21.786
Try not to panic.
Breathe.

21:21.820 --> 21:23.888
[Both gasping]

21:23.922 --> 21:26.357
No! No, I will not
let this happen.

21:26.392 --> 21:27.692
Claudia, talk to me!

21:27.727 --> 21:28.927
What do you see?

21:28.961 --> 21:31.330
White everywhere.

21:31.364 --> 21:33.265
And Steve...
[Gasps]

21:37.936 --> 21:40.371
[Silently]

21:46.010 --> 21:48.544
[Silently]

21:48.579 --> 21:50.412
Don't go to him.
He has to come to you.

21:50.447 --> 21:53.482
Stay focused on me,
and bring him with you.

21:53.516 --> 21:55.350
You wanted to save him,
so save him!

21:55.384 --> 21:56.417
Damn it!
Breathe!

21:56.452 --> 21:57.885
[Gasping]

22:01.256 --> 22:04.525
Steve!
Steve!

22:23.576 --> 22:25.943
[Breathing normally]
That's it.

22:25.977 --> 22:29.079
That's it.
Yes.

22:29.113 --> 22:31.415
[Exhaling]

22:31.450 --> 22:35.419
[Metronome ticking]

22:35.454 --> 22:37.821
[Inhales]

22:37.856 --> 22:40.556
[Sighs]

22:42.591 --> 22:43.557
Hey.

22:43.592 --> 22:46.426
[Crying]
Oh, my God.

22:48.462 --> 22:50.963
What happened?

22:50.998 --> 22:53.098
[Laughs]

22:53.133 --> 22:57.235
[Metronome ticking]

22:57.270 --> 22:59.837
There has to be something
more that you can tell me.

22:59.871 --> 23:01.236
Something specific.

23:01.269 --> 23:03.333
Knowing the evil
won't help

23:03.367 --> 23:04.901
you locate
the astrolabe.

23:04.935 --> 23:06.302
I have to know
everything.

23:06.336 --> 23:08.470
Everything about the astrolabe
in order to find it.

23:08.505 --> 23:10.539
For instance,
was it used before?

23:10.573 --> 23:13.308
Yes, but every circumstance
is different.

23:13.342 --> 23:15.510
And the evil
that was released?

23:15.544 --> 23:20.947
By Robespierre, at the advent
of the French Revolution.

23:21.949 --> 23:22.916
The reign of terror.

23:22.950 --> 23:24.751
Which resulted
in the deaths

23:24.785 --> 23:26.152
of tens of thousands
of people,

23:26.186 --> 23:29.022
so you see
the possibilities.

23:29.056 --> 23:31.290
Nothing? There was nothing
that could be done to stop it?

23:31.325 --> 23:32.625
[Sighs]

23:32.659 --> 23:35.027
Yes, I've explained the only way
to stop the evil

23:35.061 --> 23:36.861
from being created
is to reverse

23:36.896 --> 23:38.796
the effect
of the astrolabe.

23:38.830 --> 23:42.030
There has to be
another way.

23:42.065 --> 23:44.199
It was huge.

23:44.233 --> 23:47.034
With wings
and these glowing eyes.

23:47.068 --> 23:50.502
Yeah, he started acting weird
right after lunch.

23:50.537 --> 23:53.271
Must have been the mushrooms
he had in his salad.

23:53.305 --> 23:56.707
That happens sometimes,
especially with wild mushrooms.

23:56.741 --> 23:58.209
It's the psilocybin.

23:58.243 --> 23:59.677
Thank God
you got here in time.

23:59.712 --> 24:00.979
It was like he was having
a nightmare,

24:01.013 --> 24:02.446
but he was wide awake.

24:02.481 --> 24:03.981
This happened
as soon as you got home?

24:04.015 --> 24:05.281
Right after I got inside.

24:05.316 --> 24:09.619
Did you see anything else?
Anything unusual?

24:09.653 --> 24:11.320
Nothing.

24:11.355 --> 24:14.056
Okay, look, Robin,
just walk me through this, okay?

24:14.090 --> 24:16.558
Jimmy was home,
you got home from the store.

24:16.592 --> 24:17.692
You got out of your car.

24:17.727 --> 24:20.095
I grabbed the groceries
from the trunk.

24:20.129 --> 24:21.563
And then I go inside.

24:21.597 --> 24:23.364
Oh, yeah.
There was a man.

24:23.399 --> 24:25.500
He thought he dropped my key,
but--

24:25.534 --> 24:30.237
Wait, wait, wait.
A man.

24:30.272 --> 24:32.339
A man--
a man thought what?

24:32.373 --> 24:34.907
Well, he handed me
a silver key,

24:34.941 --> 24:37.408
but it wasn't mine,
so I gave it back.

24:37.443 --> 24:40.211
A key, a key.

24:40.245 --> 24:41.479
Mykes, do you still have
those sketches?

24:41.513 --> 24:43.447
Yeah, if you could just
excuse us for a second?

24:43.482 --> 24:45.482
Yeah.

24:49.253 --> 24:50.553
You know,
there must be

24:50.587 --> 24:53.255
some sort of time element
to this artifact.

24:53.290 --> 24:57.058
I mean, her husband saw
some terrifying something,

24:57.092 --> 24:58.326
and then we show up
a few minutes later,

24:58.360 --> 24:59.693
and we don't see
anything at all.

24:59.728 --> 25:01.361
And the same thing happened
to the cops at the diner.

25:01.396 --> 25:04.430
A key.
Nightmare. Tentacles.

25:04.465 --> 25:05.431
Tentacles!

25:05.465 --> 25:06.799
Would you stop staying
that word?

25:06.833 --> 25:07.800
That's it! That's it!

25:07.834 --> 25:09.601
- Cthulhu.
- What?

25:09.636 --> 25:11.604
That's what I've been trying
to remember, Mykes.

25:11.638 --> 25:13.739
When I was a kid,
I read these comic books

25:13.773 --> 25:16.442
about a sea creature
named...

25:16.476 --> 25:18.744
Cthulhu.

25:18.778 --> 25:20.345
"Created
by H.P. Lovecraft."

25:20.380 --> 25:22.414
You know, I've never read
anything by him.

25:22.448 --> 25:24.382
What?
A writer you never read?

25:24.416 --> 25:25.483
Well, when it
comes to horror,

25:25.517 --> 25:27.651
I'm more of
a Kafka or Shelley girl.

25:27.685 --> 25:29.286
But Cthulhu,
I mean the mythos

25:29.320 --> 25:32.088
does permeate a lot
of popular culture.

25:32.122 --> 25:33.289
Well, you lost me there.

25:33.323 --> 25:36.092
But these things
that they've been seeing...

25:36.127 --> 25:38.295
Are definitely
Lovecraft.

25:38.329 --> 25:39.863
Tentacles, claws,
and sometimes wings

25:39.897 --> 25:41.632
are all common
to Lovecraft creatures.

25:41.666 --> 25:44.534
Apparently, he suffered
a form of waking dream

25:44.568 --> 25:45.568
called night terrors.

25:45.603 --> 25:47.036
They came to him
in his dreams.

25:47.071 --> 25:48.571
- Nightmares.
- Right.

25:48.606 --> 25:49.773
And yes.

25:49.807 --> 25:51.241
He blamed it on
a silver key.

25:51.275 --> 25:54.043
He called it "the key
to the gate of dreams."

25:54.078 --> 25:56.513
Aha.
I smell artifact.

25:56.547 --> 25:58.081
Okay.
Thanks, Leena.

25:58.115 --> 26:00.817
Okay. Okay.

26:00.851 --> 26:05.922
So--so a man in a baseball cap
gives Robin a silver key.

26:05.956 --> 26:06.923
- Right.
- Right?

26:06.958 --> 26:07.958
She walks into the house,

26:07.992 --> 26:09.326
like the guy
at the dental office.

26:09.360 --> 26:11.828
Or the kid in the diner--
oh, my God, Pete.

26:11.863 --> 26:13.396
We're looking at this thing
all wrong.

26:13.431 --> 26:15.999
It's not the people
who are seeing

26:16.033 --> 26:18.468
Lovecraft's creatures
who've been affected.

26:18.503 --> 26:20.170
It's the victims.

26:20.205 --> 26:21.839
The victims are the ones
who get whammied.

26:21.873 --> 26:24.308
The artifact makes people
see them as monsters.

26:24.342 --> 26:25.976
Okay, we need to go to talk
to the first victim.

26:26.010 --> 26:28.078
- We can't. He's in a coma.
- Okay.

26:28.112 --> 26:29.279
Well, we'll just--
we'll go to his house then.

26:29.313 --> 26:30.947
And--and try
and find a connection.

26:30.982 --> 26:32.582
Let's go.

26:34.452 --> 26:36.420
I'm not finding
anything.

26:36.454 --> 26:38.488
Mykes.

26:38.523 --> 26:42.661
Look at this.

26:42.695 --> 26:44.229
What?
It's from the championship game.

26:44.264 --> 26:47.766
Didn't Robin say that
our key collector wore a hat

26:47.800 --> 26:49.269
from the championship game?

26:49.303 --> 26:50.504
Yeah, so?

26:50.538 --> 26:53.006
So they went
to the same game.

26:53.041 --> 26:55.209
Philadelphia
versus Cincinnati.

26:55.243 --> 26:57.578
Okay, so what was so important
about that game?

26:57.613 --> 26:58.680
I don't know.

26:58.714 --> 27:00.282
After Cleveland lost,
I quit watching.

27:00.316 --> 27:01.385
Which was early.

27:01.420 --> 27:05.561
Wait.
Philly versus Cincinnati.

27:05.596 --> 27:09.766
I remember something
about that game.

27:09.800 --> 27:11.034
You know
about a sports event?

27:11.068 --> 27:13.369
Something that could
connect our victims?

27:13.403 --> 27:15.037
[Tapping keys]
Not something.

27:15.072 --> 27:16.038
Someone.

27:16.072 --> 27:17.640
[Clicking]

27:17.674 --> 27:21.144
Theresa Hicks.

27:21.178 --> 27:25.849
She died at that game.

27:34.128 --> 27:36.574
I feel like I've been hit
by a truck.

27:36.608 --> 27:39.242
Yeah, well--

27:39.277 --> 27:40.277
[Groans]
The last thing I remember,

27:40.311 --> 27:43.546
Marcus was coming at me
with a syringe.

27:43.581 --> 27:45.549
Ooh.

27:45.583 --> 27:47.784
Guess I wasn't much
of a hero.

27:47.819 --> 27:50.554
Oh, no, you were a hero.
You were amazing.

27:50.588 --> 27:53.656
Oh, yeah?
So how did I end up here?

27:53.691 --> 27:57.026
Well, the injection Marcus
gave you was pretty intense.

27:57.060 --> 27:59.695
You know, you were out
of commission for a while.

27:59.730 --> 28:01.464
But what you did
saved us.

28:01.498 --> 28:03.532
Your intel led us
right to Sykes.

28:03.567 --> 28:05.468
- So he's--
- Finished.

28:05.502 --> 28:07.705
- The Warehouse is safe.
- And Marcus?

28:07.739 --> 28:10.574
Also finished.
For good, this time.

28:10.608 --> 28:11.775
[Sighs]

28:11.809 --> 28:13.943
Well, I must have been out
of it for a while

28:13.978 --> 28:16.646
- to have missed all that.
- Yeah.

28:16.680 --> 28:19.749
But you're back now, Jinksy.
Good as new.

28:19.784 --> 28:24.688
Why aren't we
in my room?

28:24.722 --> 28:26.856
No reason.

28:26.891 --> 28:27.991
It's cleaner, easier.

28:28.025 --> 28:29.793
It's closer to the front door,
really.

28:29.827 --> 28:31.628
- Claudia.
- Yeah?

28:31.662 --> 28:33.396
What aren't you
telling me?

28:33.430 --> 28:34.897
[Laughs] What?
Nothing.

28:34.932 --> 28:36.065
Oh, now you're lying.

28:36.100 --> 28:38.034
[Laughs] Okay.

28:38.068 --> 28:39.869
I guess
we didn't lose the whole

28:39.903 --> 28:42.405
human lie detector thing.
God, I was kind of hoping.

28:42.439 --> 28:44.607
Lose?
Why would I lose--

[metronome ticking]

28:52.186 --> 28:58.158
[Ticking grows louder]

29:01.463 --> 29:03.030
Steve,
listen to me.

29:03.064 --> 29:05.166
I wasn't lying to you,
exactly.

29:05.200 --> 29:08.870
A lot of things happened.

29:08.904 --> 29:12.540
[Door shuts]

29:12.574 --> 29:15.678
Here's the security camera
footage we have

29:15.713 --> 29:16.847
from that part
of the stadium.

29:16.881 --> 29:19.282
The victim's name
was Theresa Hicks.

29:19.317 --> 29:22.352
I know.
It's a name I'll never forget.

29:22.386 --> 29:25.522
[Tapping keys, computer beeps]

29:25.556 --> 29:27.223
Look,
that's her right there.

29:27.258 --> 29:30.426
She was knocked out.

29:30.461 --> 29:32.562
Wait, stop. Stop.
That's him.

29:32.596 --> 29:34.063
That's--that's the guy
who was attacked

29:34.098 --> 29:35.632
at the dental office.

29:35.666 --> 29:36.900
- He knocked her down, right?
- Right.

29:36.934 --> 29:37.900
That's--
that's the accountant.

29:37.935 --> 29:39.769
Could you keep it running,
please?

29:39.803 --> 29:41.404
[Tapping keys]

He got in his way.

Oh, my God,
that's--that's Joe,

29:45.709 --> 29:47.743
- the kid from the diner.
- Yes, it is.

29:47.778 --> 29:50.146
- He wouldn't help either.
- Oh, wait.

29:50.181 --> 29:51.781
Let me pull up
a different angle here.

29:51.816 --> 29:53.249
[Tapping keys, computer beeps]

29:53.283 --> 29:57.220
Okay, this is
a few seconds later.

29:57.254 --> 29:58.721
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

29:58.756 --> 30:01.257
Wasn't she just holding his hand
a few seconds ago?

30:01.291 --> 30:02.892
That newspaper article--

30:02.926 --> 30:05.161
it said that Theresa Hicks
was engaged.

30:05.195 --> 30:08.731
Right, right.
Uh...Ron Hadsell.

30:08.766 --> 30:10.396
He's trying
to save her.

30:10.430 --> 30:12.726
- Why won't she help?
- That's Robin.

30:12.760 --> 30:15.326
- The--the housewife.
- He couldn't save her.

30:15.360 --> 30:17.461
- What?
- He couldn't save her.

30:17.496 --> 30:20.397
He--he couldn't save her,
so he blames them.

30:20.432 --> 30:22.432
All those people.

30:22.467 --> 30:24.834
The man
who pushed her down,

30:24.869 --> 30:26.269
the woman who wouldn't stop
to help.

30:26.303 --> 30:29.839
To Ron Hadsell,
those people are monsters.

30:29.873 --> 30:31.907
He used
Lovecraft's key

30:31.942 --> 30:35.510
so that people would see them
as real monsters.

30:35.544 --> 30:38.412
And suffer the same fate
as his fiancee did.

30:38.447 --> 30:41.080

30:41.114 --> 30:45.016

the ambulance.

on his list.

Ron Hadsell.

and find his next victim.

I should have told you.

31:16.309 --> 31:19.611
