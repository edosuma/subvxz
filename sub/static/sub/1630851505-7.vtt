09:50.938 --> 09:54.637
and June grass last night.

09:54.681 --> 09:58.075
Huh, that really
narrowed things down.

09:58.119 --> 09:59.686
Glad I did that.

09:59.729 --> 10:01.644
[chuckles] It all helps.

10:01.688 --> 10:03.733
We'll keep whittling.Okay.

10:05.735 --> 10:07.389
RAJAN:
ATLAS says there's gypsum here,

10:07.432 --> 10:08.825
mixed with the dust
on the horseshoes.

10:08.869 --> 10:11.219
That must have been
what fluoresced under the ALS.

10:14.744 --> 10:16.703
Still too large
an area to search.

10:16.746 --> 10:17.965
We're not done yet.

10:18.008 --> 10:20.402
There's also
rare earth elements.

10:20.445 --> 10:23.013
Scandium. Gadolinium.

10:23.057 --> 10:24.667
Battery stuff, right?

10:24.711 --> 10:26.060
Thought those
were mined in China.

10:26.103 --> 10:27.670
Mm, mostly. But
geological surveys

10:27.714 --> 10:30.107
here, here and here

10:30.151 --> 10:31.761
have all recorded rare earths.

10:31.805 --> 10:33.937
Factor in where Kings
Gambit turned up,

10:33.981 --> 10:36.287
we might just find
our rider out here,

10:36.331 --> 10:38.681
past Sunset Manor.

10:38.725 --> 10:40.770
I'll let LVPD know.

10:40.814 --> 10:43.251
Time to form a posse
and find our guy.

10:44.992 --> 10:46.994
[indistinct radio chatter]

10:49.387 --> 10:51.041
If our vic survived,

10:51.085 --> 10:53.304
he probably crawled under
something for shade.

10:53.348 --> 10:55.698
Keep trying to picture
Dr. Folsom, veterinarian.

10:55.742 --> 10:56.873
[chuckles]When did you decide

10:56.917 --> 10:58.135
CSI was for you?

10:59.180 --> 11:00.181
Hmm.

11:00.224 --> 11:01.312
[clicking tongue]

11:01.356 --> 11:02.357
About two years ago.

11:02.400 --> 11:03.445
What? You've been a criminalist

11:03.488 --> 11:04.838
longer than two years.

11:04.881 --> 11:06.404
We better pick up the pace.

11:06.448 --> 11:07.667
Hmm.

11:12.236 --> 11:14.717
SIDLE:
Martin Kline had nice furniture,

11:14.761 --> 11:16.763
before it got blown up.

11:16.806 --> 11:19.766
"D34-6A."

11:19.809 --> 11:21.332
It's another piece of the chair.

11:21.376 --> 11:25.032
Huh. There might be
some blood here.

11:25.075 --> 11:26.033
Sounds like a bad day at IKEA.

11:26.076 --> 11:27.251
I'll test it.

11:27.295 --> 11:28.426
It's probably more
of Kline's blood,

11:28.470 --> 11:31.734
considering the proximity
to the blast.

11:31.778 --> 11:33.170
Hey, Chris?

11:33.214 --> 11:34.432
You all right?
You seem a little...

11:34.476 --> 11:35.869
Pissed?

11:37.871 --> 11:41.352
This perp took my luminol and
used it to get away with murder.

11:41.396 --> 11:43.006
Almost cost me my job.

11:43.050 --> 11:45.879
Plus, he's screwing up
about a zillion convictions.

11:45.922 --> 11:48.229
Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln,
how'd you like the play?

11:48.272 --> 11:49.447
Other than that,

11:49.491 --> 11:50.492
I'm great.

11:56.585 --> 11:58.065
[laughs softly]

12:00.328 --> 12:02.199
Is that the pin
from the grenade?

12:02.243 --> 12:04.027
Where was that?

12:04.071 --> 12:06.508
It was stuck to the bottom
of this chunk of drywall.

12:06.551 --> 12:07.857
How did I miss that?

12:15.256 --> 12:18.825
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a fiber.

12:18.868 --> 12:20.217
SIDLE: Forget the grenade.

12:20.261 --> 12:22.742
This thread might be
what actually blows Wix up.

12:30.619 --> 12:32.447
Hey, Bryan.
How you doing?

12:32.490 --> 12:35.537
Well, I am almost finished
digitizing everything up to '92.

12:35.580 --> 12:36.930
Then I'd slow down.

12:36.973 --> 12:38.061
'Cause you got, like, what,

12:38.105 --> 12:40.890
20 more hours of
community service?

12:40.934 --> 12:43.414
Well, I'm just trying
to do a good job.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.068
Come here.

12:46.330 --> 12:48.245
You're not, uh,

12:48.289 --> 12:50.595
angling for a full-time gig,
are you?

12:50.639 --> 12:53.033
Well, as a matter of fact...[gasps] Oh...

12:53.076 --> 12:56.210
[chuckles]I knew you'd figure it out.

12:56.253 --> 12:57.907
Come on, now.

12:57.951 --> 13:00.823
You know where
you come from!

13:00.867 --> 13:02.825
Got all them A's in science.

13:02.869 --> 13:03.957
[chuckles]

13:04.000 --> 13:05.262
What?

13:05.306 --> 13:06.481
This is good news.

13:06.524 --> 13:08.962
Yeah, Mom,
I don't want a job here.

13:09.005 --> 13:10.920
I need your help
getting a work card.

13:10.964 --> 13:12.574
I got a job lined
up over at Aurora.

13:12.617 --> 13:15.011
Hosting. Can you believe that?
[chuckles]

13:15.055 --> 13:16.839
You want to work at a casino?

13:16.883 --> 13:18.275
Well, I want to run one someday.

13:18.319 --> 13:20.451
But what-what happened
to, like, art school?

13:20.495 --> 13:23.411
Mom, you didn't care about
that a second ago. You know.

13:23.454 --> 13:26.936
I thought graphic design
was the thing for me.

13:27.981 --> 13:29.112
There's no excitement.

13:29.156 --> 13:31.201
You just sit there by yourself
all day.

13:31.245 --> 13:33.290
You want to hang around
at a casino?

13:33.334 --> 13:34.465
Please trust me. Please.

13:34.509 --> 13:36.990
I know this is
the right thing for me.

13:37.033 --> 13:38.208
And I need your help.

13:50.655 --> 13:52.570
You ever been on a horse
this long?

13:52.614 --> 13:54.355
Previous best
was a pony at the fair.

13:54.398 --> 13:56.226
FOLSOM:
[chuckles] You're a natural.

13:56.270 --> 13:57.401
RAJAN: Thanks. That's...Uh-oh.

13:57.445 --> 13:58.576
What?

13:58.620 --> 14:00.361
FOLSOM:
Over there.

14:00.404 --> 14:01.492
Look.

14:07.368 --> 14:08.978
We got him.

14:09.022 --> 14:10.153
I'll drop a pin.

14:15.071 --> 14:16.986
I know.
I got my hopes up, too.

14:17.030 --> 14:19.162
Gunshot.
Through and through.

14:19.206 --> 14:20.990
Some of the blood
on Kings Gambit

14:21.034 --> 14:23.688
was probably arterial spray
that got covered up

14:23.732 --> 14:26.387
when he fell forward
and the wound kept gushing.

14:31.087 --> 14:34.003
Emery Hollis. 50 years old.

14:34.047 --> 14:36.092
RAJAN:
I hope he bled out
before they started beating him.

14:36.136 --> 14:39.182
FOLSOM:
A lot more spatter than I would
expect from those wounds.

14:39.226 --> 14:40.662
We better document all this.

14:40.705 --> 14:42.707
We need to know
where this started.

14:42.751 --> 14:44.405
I'll take the body.

14:48.539 --> 14:50.193
FOLSOM:All right, guys,
let's get someone

14:50.237 --> 14:51.934
from the coroner's
out here.

14:53.980 --> 14:55.938
[shutter clicking]

15:01.030 --> 15:03.685
Hey. This is where he was shot.

15:03.728 --> 15:06.557
Horse bolted.
He fell off at that shed.

15:06.601 --> 15:08.385
He was almost home.

15:08.429 --> 15:10.910
We're close to the
victim's address.

15:23.270 --> 15:25.054
Y-You're trespassing!

15:27.535 --> 15:30.712
But your hair's pretty.
Looks soft.

15:30.755 --> 15:34.672
Jonas? We have cops.

15:34.716 --> 15:36.152
Hey, everybody.

15:36.196 --> 15:37.197
Come say hi to the cops.

15:37.240 --> 15:38.372
FOLSOM:
We're not police.

15:38.415 --> 15:39.677
We're from the crime lab.

15:39.721 --> 15:41.592
Are you in charge here, sir?

15:41.636 --> 15:44.291
Jonas, for Pete's sake,
will you put that axe away?

15:46.597 --> 15:48.425
I'm Denny Trask.
I'm the foreman here.

15:48.469 --> 15:50.688
Sorry about
the welcoming committee.

15:50.732 --> 15:52.690
The kids get a little skittish
around law enforcement.

15:52.734 --> 15:54.736
We try to get them
past it, but...

15:54.779 --> 15:56.085
uh, you can imagine.

15:56.129 --> 15:59.480
Not-not really.
Sorry, what is this place?

15:59.523 --> 16:01.569
I suspected
you knew.

16:01.612 --> 16:03.614
Rancho Comienzos
is a halfway house.

16:03.658 --> 16:05.138
These kids--

16:05.181 --> 16:06.443
they're all, you know,

16:06.487 --> 16:08.141
convicted killers.

16:24.070 --> 16:25.680
I just saw my dad last night.

16:27.551 --> 16:29.727
Cory. Cory.

16:29.771 --> 16:31.381
Those guns--

16:31.425 --> 16:33.427
are those all of the firearms
on the property?

16:33.470 --> 16:36.038
CORY:
My dad inherited them.

16:36.082 --> 16:38.127
He never took them out.
I don't really know.

16:38.171 --> 16:40.303
RAJAN:
None of these have
been fired recently.

16:40.347 --> 16:42.044
Or cleaned, even.

16:42.088 --> 16:43.654
It's hard to tell
if any are missing, though.

16:46.092 --> 16:47.354
We're gonna need
to speak to everyone

16:47.397 --> 16:49.486
who has access
to this safe, Cory.

16:49.530 --> 16:51.793
Is your brother about?

16:51.836 --> 16:53.838
CORY:
Um, no.

16:53.882 --> 16:56.450
He killed himself
when he was 14.

16:56.493 --> 16:58.582
Connor was violent.

16:58.626 --> 17:00.454
Toward others,

17:00.497 --> 17:02.499
then himself.

17:02.543 --> 17:05.111
My dad did everything he could
to help him, but...

17:07.113 --> 17:09.158
That's why he started
this place.

17:09.202 --> 17:11.073
To save the next Connor.

17:11.117 --> 17:13.815
So this ranch is staffed with
juvenile homicide offenders?

17:13.858 --> 17:15.512
Yeah, they get a roof
over their head,

17:15.556 --> 17:18.733
an honest day's work,
equine therapy.

17:18.776 --> 17:20.343
And where did you get
the horses from?

17:20.387 --> 17:23.259
Uh, had Butch forever.

17:23.303 --> 17:25.131
Sundance we found grazing
on the edge of the property

17:25.174 --> 17:26.480
about a year ago.

17:26.523 --> 17:29.613
Just lost from a wild herd,
we figured.

17:29.657 --> 17:31.833
Is he all right?ROBY: So, Cory,

17:31.876 --> 17:33.182
I'm gonna need some information,

17:33.226 --> 17:35.445
some DNA samples
from your residents here.

17:35.489 --> 17:37.708
Uh, there's three right now.

17:43.279 --> 17:45.542
We have to maintain files
for the state.

17:45.586 --> 17:47.196
Hmm.

17:47.240 --> 17:51.548
Jonas Reeves, pushed a kid
in front of a truck.

17:51.592 --> 17:54.638
May Ellen Peyton,
dosed her father

17:54.682 --> 17:57.859
with rat poison so
he would stop snoring.

17:57.902 --> 17:59.556
Theo LaVelle.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.471
This little devil
made national news.

18:01.515 --> 18:05.258
He beat his folks to death
with a shovel.

18:05.301 --> 18:08.391
My dad would take a chance
on anybody.

18:08.435 --> 18:10.654
He was a hero.

18:10.698 --> 18:13.266
ROBY:
You kids. You get to visit

18:13.309 --> 18:14.745
a real-life murder ranch
and you're still

18:14.789 --> 18:17.400
just staring at your screens.

18:17.444 --> 18:18.401
Thought I'd try to figure out
what kind of weapon

18:18.445 --> 18:20.360
we're looking for.Hmm.

18:20.403 --> 18:22.405
[sighs]

18:22.449 --> 18:24.668
Well, that's a lot of castoff.

18:24.712 --> 18:26.540
It's a strange pattern.

18:26.583 --> 18:28.585
FOLSOM:
I'm thinking maybe a sledge.

18:28.629 --> 18:30.544
Flings off those tendrils
as it spins?

18:30.587 --> 18:31.806
Maybe.

18:31.849 --> 18:33.764
Go and find out
what made that mess.

18:33.808 --> 18:36.941
Tell Allie
what we're looking for.

18:36.985 --> 18:38.682
She'll turn this place
upside down.

18:38.726 --> 18:40.162
You headed off to the autopsy?

18:40.206 --> 18:41.250
Yeah.Bet Hugo finds

18:41.294 --> 18:42.251
a big heart in there.Mm-hmm.

18:42.295 --> 18:44.210
Opening his home to this crew.

18:44.253 --> 18:45.515
Wonder if, uh,
Hollis knew

18:45.559 --> 18:49.258
about the recidivism rates
of violent sociopaths.

18:49.302 --> 18:51.782
I don't want to argue
with a geneticist

18:51.826 --> 18:54.481
about DNA and destiny, but...

18:54.524 --> 18:55.830
Something on your mind?

18:55.873 --> 18:58.615
Bryan called me.Yeah?

18:58.659 --> 19:02.271
He asked me if I'd be his
reference to get a work card.

19:02.315 --> 19:04.186
He got a job offer at a casino.

19:04.230 --> 19:06.623
As a host. He'd be great.

19:06.667 --> 19:08.408
Bryan's granddad

19:08.451 --> 19:09.670
is addicted to gambling.

19:09.713 --> 19:11.802
Now, I don't think Bryan
is wired that way,

19:11.846 --> 19:15.284
but statistically, the genes...

19:15.328 --> 19:16.416
If we were all just
a collection of genes,

19:16.459 --> 19:18.287
I would've robbed you blind
by now,

19:18.331 --> 19:20.376
all the crooks
in my family tree.

19:20.420 --> 19:22.596
But you're an exception, Joshua,
and I want to provide

19:22.639 --> 19:24.815
the right nurture
for Bryan's nature.

19:24.859 --> 19:27.383
I don't want him in the wrong
environment, and he shouldn't

19:27.427 --> 19:28.732
have talked to you
about this anyway.

19:28.776 --> 19:30.386
I told him
I'd think about it.

19:30.430 --> 19:33.215
Maybe he knows the stats on
how often you change your mind.

19:35.957 --> 19:37.959
♪

19:45.575 --> 19:47.403
What happened--
someone kill a unicorn?

19:47.447 --> 19:48.926
[chuckles]
No, it's not

19:48.970 --> 19:50.406
rainbow blood.

19:50.450 --> 19:52.800
Just rough drafts until I can...

19:52.843 --> 19:55.194
reproduce this pattern.

19:57.283 --> 19:58.980
Were you, uh...
were you looking for someone?

19:59.023 --> 20:00.286
No, no.

20:00.329 --> 20:02.766
I've always enjoyed
spatter analysis.

20:02.810 --> 20:05.247
Soothing.
[chuckles softly]

20:05.291 --> 20:08.250
Type testing suggests
it's all from the victim.

20:08.294 --> 20:09.860
Hugo says he got hit
by something heavy and sharp

20:09.904 --> 20:11.688
four times.

20:12.733 --> 20:14.300
Ooh.

20:16.563 --> 20:18.608
Did you try a post hole shovel?

20:18.652 --> 20:19.914
FOLSOM:
Closest I've come. Still not it.

Breaking news from the Las Vegas
criminalistics case

40:01.877 --> 40:04.880
as final motions have been made
for the upcoming trial.

40:04.924 --> 40:07.056
Adam Tyner,
David Hodges' lawyer,

40:07.100 --> 40:09.232
has been angling
to eliminate certain pieces

40:09.276 --> 40:10.799
of evidence...We're gonna stop him.

40:10.843 --> 40:12.845
...that could potentially
connect Hodges to the warehou...

40:12.888 --> 40:14.847
The world's
gone nuts, Sara.

40:14.890 --> 40:16.196
People don't even believe
the truth

40:16.239 --> 40:18.459
in front of their faces anymore.

40:18.503 --> 40:20.635
Facts,
evidently,

40:20.679 --> 40:21.984
up for debate.

40:22.028 --> 40:24.117
Empirical science, eh,

40:24.160 --> 40:25.727
just someone's opinion.

40:25.771 --> 40:28.469
You know, if Wix's sister
was so confident

40:28.513 --> 40:30.471
that we wouldn't find
anything in their home,

40:30.515 --> 40:33.822
maybe he ran the whole
frame-up from someplace else.

40:35.607 --> 40:37.522
Well...

40:37.565 --> 40:39.872
if that's the rabbit hole
you want to go down, darling,

40:39.915 --> 40:41.439
I'll jump in with you.

40:43.005 --> 40:44.137
[chuckles]:
Oh.

40:44.180 --> 40:46.966
Someone found
what they were looking for.

40:47.009 --> 40:49.011
Sometimes it works
backwards, right?

Find the perp, leads you
to the murder weapon.

40:51.579 --> 40:52.972
I heard it was
the victim's son.He cleaned it

40:53.015 --> 40:54.582
pretty good before he tossed it
in the dumpster

40:54.626 --> 40:56.802
behind his apartment, but DNA
on the handle's gonna help

40:56.845 --> 40:58.717
put him away.What about the horse?

40:58.760 --> 40:59.718
I hope he's not
gonna go back

40:59.761 --> 41:01.633
to the owner.Well...

41:02.982 --> 41:05.550
Wiped out my savings
and had to pull some strings,

41:05.593 --> 41:07.813
but he's mine now.

41:07.856 --> 41:09.684
Figure it'll be fun on weekends.

Why not? Every hero
deserves a white horse.

I'm sorry about this, Max.

What?

You know
exactly why I'm here.

41:34.622 --> 41:37.625
You contacted the head
of the Washoe Crime Lab.

41:37.669 --> 41:39.148
You were digging for information

41:39.192 --> 41:41.542
about how they were handling
the Hodges case.

41:41.586 --> 41:43.631
Sending this case
over there

was supposed to avoid
conflicts of interest.

You'll be demoted

Will you tell me
who's behind it?

42:15.315 --> 42:17.056
