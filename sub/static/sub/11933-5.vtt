00:48.720 --> 00:50.240
Thanks, Jeff.

01:04.280 --> 01:05.720
Sorry to disappoint you.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.520
How did you disappoint me?

01:07.600 --> 01:10.560
You failed... again.

01:12.360 --> 01:14.720
I'll be convicted of attempted murder...

01:15.640 --> 01:17.280
and the Grove Park killings
remain unsolved.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.240
-I know.

01:21.320 --> 01:24.880
Don't insult me
with "new evidence" or shit like that.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.120
We've known each other
for too long for charades.

01:30.120 --> 01:31.560
Eleven years...

01:34.600 --> 01:37.200
So what did she do, your wife?

01:39.000 --> 01:40.080
What, you mean professionally?

01:41.480 --> 01:42.880
Why did you kill her?

01:50.880 --> 01:52.440
She was going to leave. Replace me.

01:58.080 --> 01:59.880
Have you ever been
replaced, Marcella? Giving someone everything...

02:04.400 --> 02:06.480
only to find out
that someone else can do it better,

02:06.560 --> 02:09.320
so they just throw you away.

02:12.560 --> 02:13.600
It's crushing.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.840
People break up all the time.

02:22.360 --> 02:24.040
He left you...

02:25.200 --> 02:26.360
for someone else. You just don't kill them for it.

02:27.680 --> 02:29.000
Some do.

02:33.360 --> 02:35.840
How did you celebrate this morning,
by the way?

02:37.640 --> 02:39.960
-No.

02:40.040 --> 02:41.440
Juliet.

02:43.640 --> 02:46.080
It is her birthday today, isn't it?

03:38.880 --> 03:40.320
Marcella was right.

03:40.400 --> 03:43.360
The original victims from 2005.

03:43.440 --> 03:46.160
Now, if you look carefully,
tape wound around their necks clockwise.

03:46.240 --> 03:49.720
Then you come to the recent victims,
all of them...

03:50.680 --> 03:52.800
anticlockwise.
To be fair, we should have seen it.

03:52.880 --> 03:56.400
Boss, I, erm, have cracked it.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.800
The sex tape thing, Cara Thomas.

03:59.880 --> 04:01.000
The threat with the knife--

04:01.080 --> 04:02.680
-We know which one you mean.
-Good.

04:02.760 --> 04:06.200
Erm, so I extracted the ghost code
from the cam program.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.760
They were using this masking algorithm

04:07.840 --> 04:10.160
that changes the IP address
every couple of hours.

04:10.240 --> 04:12.480
That's why it took me so long.
So what I did was, I went back

04:12.560 --> 04:14.880
and I used a live trace-route
to track it, so that every time I--

04:14.960 --> 04:17.440
Standing ovation, Mark.
Where did you track it to?

04:18.880 --> 04:20.000
Mrs Claire Shaw.

04:20.880 --> 04:22.080
Cambourne.

04:23.200 --> 04:24.880
Kinky sex?

04:25.960 --> 04:28.680
I'm sorry, I really have no idea
what you're talking about.

04:28.760 --> 04:32.680
I'm not into all that
weird sex camera stuff.

04:32.760 --> 04:35.000
I traced the IP address
right to your house.

04:35.080 --> 04:37.640
I've no idea
what an IP address is.

04:37.720 --> 04:39.120
It stands for Internet Protocol address.

04:39.200 --> 04:40.640
-It's the number that you use to track--
-Mark.

04:41.880 --> 04:46.480
Mrs Shaw, does anyone else
have access to your computer?

04:46.560 --> 04:49.000
No, no one. Just me.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.120
Why

04:52.600 --> 04:56.400
Has someone
been having sex in my computer?

04:56.480 --> 04:57.880
No employees?

04:57.960 --> 05:00.160
-No.

05:00.240 --> 05:02.160
We're a really small business.

05:02.240 --> 05:03.720
Look, I've got nothing to do with this,

05:03.800 --> 05:06.600
I can barely turn a computer on...
without crashing it.

05:06.680 --> 05:09.360
And yet you run a business
through a website?

05:09.440 --> 05:12.320
Well, that's not me.
That's my computer man.

05:12.400 --> 05:15.560
Matthew Neil.
I make his life a misery.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.000
So Mrs Claire Shaw,
how do you know her?

05:31.080 --> 05:33.000
Claire Shaw, she's my client.

05:33.080 --> 05:36.200
And what services
do you provide for her?

05:36.280 --> 05:38.720
Website, server, set up her e-mail. And fielding calls several times a month.

05:41.320 --> 05:43.560
Er, why do you ask?
Has she done something?

05:43.640 --> 05:44.720
It's a police matter.

05:44.800 --> 05:47.280
Yeah, I figured that much,
but what has she done?

05:47.360 --> 05:50.080
"Several times a month."
What, so there's been problems?

05:50.960 --> 05:53.040
Has there been anything
but problems?

05:53.120 --> 05:57.240
Viruses, malware, Trojan horses,
spyware. You name it.

05:58.360 --> 06:00.400
Oh, is it "the destroyer"?

06:01.760 --> 06:02.920
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Okay. Yeah.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.520
She's an idiot.

06:05.640 --> 06:07.440
If her connection
is vulnerable to external attacks,

06:07.520 --> 06:09.840
it would be pretty easy
for someone to pose as her.

06:09.920 --> 06:11.280
Especially someone
trying to hide their activity.

06:11.360 --> 06:14.000
Yeah, hijack her IP.
Yeah, that's pretty straightforward.

06:14.080 --> 06:16.080
Is it something you could do?
-Yeah, I could.

06:16.160 --> 06:17.480
So could I.

06:19.120 --> 06:21.040
But it wouldn't be good for business.

06:22.680 --> 06:23.760
No.

06:58.120 --> 06:59.240
Thanks.

07:22.880 --> 07:24.400
Does it turn you on?

07:25.320 --> 07:27.440
The scent, does it give you a hard on?

07:29.440 --> 07:32.280
Or do you need to tie people up
and watch them die for that?

07:34.080 --> 07:37.400
Mmm.

07:39.840 --> 07:42.560
Maddy associates that smell
with Adrian.

07:44.280 --> 07:46.760
So even if you bought it for her...

07:46.840 --> 07:48.760
it would only remind her of him.

07:52.200 --> 07:53.920
Who's Adrian?

07:54.000 --> 07:56.160
The young man you tried to replace.

07:58.400 --> 08:02.600
Peter, you're not very good
with women, are you?

08:04.160 --> 08:05.440
Is that why they leave you?

08:06.480 --> 08:08.200
Use you like Maddy did.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.560
And look who's talking now.

08:14.480 --> 08:16.240
I managed 15 years with Jason.

08:16.320 --> 08:17.920
With your wife...

08:18.000 --> 08:19.680
you only managed two.

08:21.360 --> 08:22.760
<i>What is it? Is it...</i>

08:24.040 --> 08:25.800
<i>Is it because...</i>

08:27.040 --> 08:28.920
<i>you have performance problems?</i>

08:30.200 --> 08:32.400
Is that what this is about?
Can't you get it up?

08:38.280 --> 08:39.280
We found the place...

08:40.080 --> 08:41.760
where you killed Adrian.

08:43.760 --> 08:47.320
We, er, traced his phone
to the last place he answered a call.

08:48.240 --> 08:50.960
And your DNA is all mixed up in his blood.

08:53.240 --> 08:56.280
You should have stuck to your MO.

08:56.360 --> 08:58.360
Far less messy.

09:05.520 --> 09:09.160
-Traditional Polish sausage.

09:11.600 --> 09:13.280
Hope you'll like.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.000
Been in a fight, then, Bendek?

09:24.360 --> 09:27.440
-Your knuckles and, er--
-And that bloody towel in the washing.

09:33.960 --> 09:35.560
I was in a fight.

09:36.600 --> 09:37.800
I'm sorry.

09:37.880 --> 09:39.040
Why?

09:40.520 --> 09:44.600
A racist guy... stole my money

09:44.680 --> 09:48.360
and then he got mad
because I quit my job.

09:53.240 --> 09:54.960
I'm sorry.

09:59.280 --> 10:01.360
-All right.

10:01.440 --> 10:02.520
You okay?

10:03.280 --> 10:05.000
Yeah, just, erm...

10:05.960 --> 10:07.800
got up a little too quick.

10:12.640 --> 10:16.000
Right, then.
I've got a meeting to get to.

10:27.080 --> 10:30.360
Joanne. Dennis. Jennifer.

10:30.440 --> 10:32.120
All of these victims...

10:33.120 --> 10:34.480
So long ago.

10:37.280 --> 10:40.640
You know you're gonna get life
for the murder of Adrian, don't you?

10:42.960 --> 10:44.880
And then you'll just be forgotten.

10:46.040 --> 10:48.680
-Maddy won't forget me.
-Oh, she will.

10:49.560 --> 10:53.000
She was only interested in...
who she thought you were.

10:53.080 --> 10:54.720
Not some...

10:54.800 --> 10:57.400
-pisspot copycat murderer.
-There's more to me than that.

10:57.480 --> 10:59.240
-Yes.

10:59.320 --> 11:01.800
I thought you were
going to go down in history.

11:01.880 --> 11:03.480
Was I wrong to be obsessed with you?

11:06.200 --> 11:07.960
You know, I kept your case file.

11:09.240 --> 11:12.920
And every now and then,
I'd be fascinated and I'd take a look...

11:17.480 --> 11:20.200
-What a waste of time that was.
-No.

11:21.360 --> 11:23.360
You were right to be obsessed.

11:24.680 --> 11:25.880
Was I?

11:28.760 --> 11:30.720
You see, I understand you.

11:33.080 --> 11:35.320
How you feel
about being betrayed.

11:37.760 --> 11:39.360
I'm not like that.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.000
-I wouldn't betray you.
-You men, you're all the same.

11:44.920 --> 11:46.920
Big fat fucking disappointment.

11:50.520 --> 11:52.960
You can admire and respect me.

11:53.040 --> 11:56.400
I'd admire someone
who got away with murder for 11 years.

11:56.480 --> 11:57.840
I'd respect that.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.240
But that's not you.

12:05.320 --> 12:07.040
You're weak.

12:07.920 --> 12:09.800
You're a failure.

12:10.800 --> 12:13.560
That's what's disappointing.

12:22.040 --> 12:23.160
Joanne. Dennis.

12:29.360 --> 12:30.560
Jennifer.

12:34.480 --> 12:35.800
It was me.

12:39.200 --> 12:40.560
I did it. I killed them.

14:02.480 --> 14:03.800
Can I have your attention?

14:03.880 --> 14:06.520
We now consider
the 2005 killings solved.

14:06.600 --> 14:08.760
-He has confessed.

14:10.280 --> 14:13.360
Okay. End of celebration.
We've still got a killer to catch.

14:13.440 --> 14:15.160
Rav...

14:15.240 --> 14:18.200
-Yes.

14:18.280 --> 14:19.360
Tell me we've got some good news.

14:19.440 --> 14:20.680
Well, if the computer trails are dead,

14:20.760 --> 14:22.440
then we've got nothing
on that dropped key card.

14:22.520 --> 14:23.880
The missing trophy from Grace.

14:23.960 --> 14:25.000
If there was one,
we haven't found it.

14:25.080 --> 14:26.680
We've still got a maniac out there.

14:26.760 --> 14:29.400
-I know, we're back to square one.
-This is your investigation, Rav,

14:29.480 --> 14:31.520
but back to square one
is not an option.

14:39.480 --> 14:43.000
I only need what you have
on the planning department in Lambeth.

14:44.640 --> 14:46.360
Andrew Barnes... Yes.

14:46.440 --> 14:49.760
I want to stop him
blocking DTG's planning proposals.

14:53.840 --> 14:55.560
-Mr Backland.
-Victoria.

14:55.640 --> 14:56.800
Shall we?

15:03.040 --> 15:05.480
Hi.
-I believe you know Stuart Callaghan.

15:05.560 --> 15:07.640
Yeah, I did the Blackthorne job
for Gibson's last year.

15:07.720 --> 15:08.720
Ah, that's right.

15:08.800 --> 15:11.520
Stuart's been our man in the field
on this one.

15:11.600 --> 15:13.120
Well, shall we?

15:21.680 --> 15:24.280
Intelligence on the Lambeth
planning department.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.400
I pay you to get me leverage.

15:41.480 --> 15:43.160
Now, I need some on Andrew Barnes.

15:43.240 --> 15:44.480
He's clean.

15:44.560 --> 15:46.960
Maybe it's because
his wife was an MP.

15:47.040 --> 15:48.840
The others in the planning department
are more vulnerable--

15:48.920 --> 15:50.840
I don't give a shit about the others.

15:50.920 --> 15:54.400
I need more on Andrew Barnes
than just "taking antidepressants."

15:55.960 --> 15:59.800
You employ us to gather
strategic intelligence, Mr Backland.

15:59.880 --> 16:01.440
We can't find what isn't there.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.480
Well, that went well.

16:24.480 --> 16:25.760
Mr Backland!

16:27.200 --> 16:28.200
Jason.

16:29.520 --> 16:33.360
Look, I'm really sorry
that you're disappointed.

16:33.440 --> 16:35.960
This Andrew Barnes fellow,
is he an imminent problem for you?

16:36.040 --> 16:38.760
Not just for DTG,
but for me personally, yes.

16:38.840 --> 16:41.760
Right, well, I wish I could do more,
but it's SIA.

16:41.840 --> 16:43.560
What we can and can't do
is heavily regulated.

16:43.640 --> 16:44.920
I don't care about regulations.

16:45.960 --> 16:48.120
I pay you to get rid of my problems.

16:49.960 --> 16:51.560
Okay.

16:51.640 --> 16:53.160
Well, I might be able
to help you with that.

16:53.240 --> 16:54.960
Not officially, you know,
not through the firm.

16:55.040 --> 16:56.040
Fine.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.000
Then just do it.

16:59.920 --> 17:01.280
Give me a call when it's done.

17:02.240 --> 17:03.400
Okay.

17:05.920 --> 17:07.440
I think I understand.

17:26.440 --> 17:28.400
Hey!

17:28.480 --> 17:32.280
Hey, you, miss.
You... you remember me?

17:32.360 --> 17:34.000
Yeah.

17:34.080 --> 17:35.160
I was, er...

17:35.240 --> 17:37.760
I was thinking about that night
you asked me about.

17:38.480 --> 17:39.840
Right.

17:39.920 --> 17:42.800
I remember seeing someone,
er, leaving the house.

17:42.880 --> 17:44.360
Er, a woman.

17:46.520 --> 17:48.880
-Er, she came out,

17:48.960 --> 17:51.120
backed up her car
and put something into the boot -before she left.
-I thought you were sleeping.

17:53.440 --> 17:56.480
I was asleep,
but I woke up...

17:56.560 --> 17:58.560
and I saw her.

17:58.640 --> 18:01.000
Long, dark coat with the hood up.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.560
-And the car was a black Audi.

18:03.640 --> 18:04.960
Sorry?

18:05.040 --> 18:07.320
-I want to...

18:07.400 --> 18:09.960
help you.
To tell you.

18:13.920 --> 18:15.680
Thanks.

18:15.760 --> 18:17.240
Thanks, Hassan.

18:35.120 --> 18:36.520
Why are you late?

18:40.000 --> 18:42.040
Listen, I told the police what you saw.

18:42.120 --> 18:43.680
And why?

18:43.760 --> 18:46.200
It's their job, my friend.
A woman was killed there.

18:46.280 --> 18:48.040
To help them?
Have you forgotten yourself?

18:48.120 --> 18:50.760
-This is what their talk looks like.
-No, no, Mohammed,

18:50.840 --> 18:52.000
they know what they are doing here.

18:52.080 --> 18:53.680
They don't do that here.

18:54.600 --> 18:57.040
I just gave them information.

18:57.120 --> 18:58.400
Come on, let's get the other car.

18:58.480 --> 19:00.760
And what if they get someone
who wanted to testify?

19:01.840 --> 19:04.400
If they do, they do.
What do you want me to do?

19:04.480 --> 19:06.320
So that's it?

19:06.400 --> 19:07.760
Let's go.

19:07.840 --> 19:11.840
They're going to come back to you,
back to both of us.

19:11.920 --> 19:14.800
You've ruined the whole operation
to help the snakes.

19:39.520 --> 19:41.320
I am off.

19:41.400 --> 19:43.040
Working part

19:43.120 --> 19:45.800
Yann called.
He said he's got a surprise.

19:45.880 --> 19:48.520
Mmm, well, say hi for me.

19:48.600 --> 19:52.000
If it's a shitty surprise,
I'm up for some fun later.

19:58.680 --> 19:59.680
Lambeth?

19:59.760 --> 20:00.960
You've been fired...

20:02.320 --> 20:03.600
How did you get in?

20:09.760 --> 20:11.960
I can help you
put this project back together.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.640
So why would you
want to help me?

20:16.520 --> 20:18.400
Believe me, it's Plan B.

20:19.880 --> 20:21.880
You just can't stand
being away, can you?

20:21.960 --> 20:23.280
You have to be involved.

20:24.360 --> 20:26.320
You need the legal side
of things covered,

20:26.400 --> 20:29.240
-and you've got till Monday.

20:29.320 --> 20:32.200
Being informed is what
Sylvie used to pay me for.

20:32.280 --> 20:35.440
And I can help you
deal with Andrew Barnes.

20:41.800 --> 20:43.480
Have you heard
anything new about Grace?

20:45.480 --> 20:47.600
No.

20:49.480 --> 20:51.120
Do you think it's Cullen?

20:53.120 --> 20:54.120
I know it is.

20:56.760 --> 20:58.120
From Marcella.

20:59.040 --> 21:01.640
Your wife is investigating
the murder of my sister?

21:06.760 --> 21:08.080
Can I talk to her?

21:14.560 --> 21:16.480
Bring me to Lambeth.

21:16.560 --> 21:18.240
I want full credit for my work.

21:20.160 --> 21:21.440
Fine.

21:22.280 --> 21:23.400
Okay, let's go.

21:52.200 --> 21:53.320
Sorry I'm late, princess.

21:53.400 --> 21:55.160
That's okay, Dad.

21:56.520 --> 21:58.960
Mum says you're always late,
but I know you had to work.

21:59.040 --> 22:01.560
Yeah, well, the thing is, I've...
I've got a little more work to do.

22:01.640 --> 22:04.880
-Me.

22:04.960 --> 22:06.320
And Mr Sniffles?

22:08.320 --> 22:11.760
Yes, if I can
have a carrot afterwards.

22:11.840 --> 22:14.640
That sounds fair. Seatbelt.

22:32.760 --> 22:33.760
Jason?

22:36.240 --> 22:38.280
-Hi.

22:39.440 --> 22:40.480
Hi.

22:41.720 --> 22:43.880
Can I have a word, please? Upstairs.

22:53.400 --> 22:54.640
-He just wants to know

22:54.720 --> 22:55.760
where you're at with the case.

22:55.840 --> 22:57.640
And tell him what you told me,
that it was Cullen.

22:57.720 --> 22:58.880
It wasn't.

22:59.360 --> 23:00.800
I haven't got a clue who it is.

23:02.240 --> 23:03.800
When were you
going to tell me that?

23:04.480 --> 23:06.160
Well, calling you about
who didn't kill your girlfriend

23:06.240 --> 23:08.400
-isn't exactly my priority.

23:09.320 --> 23:11.000
Well, tell him something.

23:11.080 --> 23:12.520
Look, I'm trying to get my job back.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.320
And I want to keep mine.

23:17.920 --> 23:21.600
Hi, I'm sorry, I don't know
what he's promised you, but...

23:23.840 --> 23:25.560
it's highly inappropriate.

23:25.640 --> 23:26.680
I understand.

23:26.760 --> 23:28.640
Just one thing,
why did he move my sister?

23:31.080 --> 23:34.280
-I don't know.
-He didn't move any of the others. So...

23:37.640 --> 23:40.480
I'm sorry, this is...
Yeah, erm, thank you.

23:40.560 --> 23:41.680
Good luck.

23:41.760 --> 23:44.200
Yeah, I'm sorry I couldn't help more.

24:04.120 --> 24:05.400
So you're just gonna leave?

24:06.480 --> 24:07.480
Yeah.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.640
I can't go back to that.

24:55.320 --> 24:56.480
Darling Juliet...

24:57.520 --> 24:59.640
Happy birthday, sweetie...

25:20.280 --> 25:22.440
So, have you heard anything more
from the police?

25:23.360 --> 25:26.400
Should I have?

25:26.480 --> 25:28.760
IT crimes, so boring.

25:36.200 --> 25:37.200
Ta-da!

25:38.200 --> 25:39.520
What? I don't get it.

25:40.520 --> 25:43.160
Well, this is where
we had our first dinner in London.

25:43.240 --> 25:44.920
And I have made them
copy everything.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.640
You know, the food,
the wine for you, the same table...

25:49.560 --> 25:51.240
-everything.
You remember what we had?

25:53.080 --> 25:54.520
Yeah, of course I do.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.440
-Crazy.
-Come on.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.920
-Go on.

26:04.960 --> 26:06.000
Hi.

26:09.240 --> 26:10.720
-Seven to three.

26:11.720 --> 26:12.760
What's that?

26:14.160 --> 26:16.040
That's how many times
you've talked about Henry

26:16.120 --> 26:18.120
and how many times
you've talked about me,

26:18.200 --> 26:20.000
or us during dinner. What are you doing, counting?

26:24.960 --> 26:27.160
Er, it's just that
I really made an effort tonight.

26:27.960 --> 26:29.520
Yeah, you did.

26:29.600 --> 26:31.440
So why... why destroy it?

26:31.520 --> 26:34.520
It's just that
you talk about him all the time.

26:34.600 --> 26:36.280
Yeah, I do.
He's my best friend.

26:36.360 --> 26:37.760
And he's going through difficult times.

26:37.840 --> 26:39.280
So are we.

26:41.360 --> 26:43.120
I moved away from everything,

26:43.200 --> 26:47.120
from my daughter,
from my job, everything,

26:47.200 --> 26:50.440
to be here with you,
not to be here with you and Henry.

26:57.880 --> 26:59.000
What are you doing?

27:01.600 --> 27:04.960
-Going to have some fun.
-Don't do this. Matthew.

27:29.520 --> 27:32.480
Hey, Hassan...
you asleep?

28:30.160 --> 28:31.240
Marcella!

28:32.160 --> 28:34.880
-I thought you drove here.
-I've been at a Premier Lodge.

28:34.960 --> 28:36.880
-Ha-ha, very funny.

28:36.960 --> 28:39.240
You know, Mark's hacker friend
managed to extract information

28:39.320 --> 28:40.840
from that card we found
in the old guy's garden.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.040
-Yes.

28:42.120 --> 28:44.800
And luckily, it retains information
until it's reprogrammed.

28:44.880 --> 28:47.040
I've got the name
of the last person who used it.

28:48.720 --> 28:50.520
Sit up.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.600
<i>Bendek Krol?</i>

28:55.680 --> 28:57.480
<i>Yes.</i>

29:02.160 --> 29:03.920
Your shoe size, size ten?

29:05.640 --> 29:08.120
-Forty-three.

29:08.200 --> 29:12.040
Erm, 37...
Yeah, it's a nine.

29:14.240 --> 29:15.600
Why am I here?

29:16.520 --> 29:17.960
Before you moved in
with the Callaghans,

29:18.040 --> 29:19.440
where were you living?

29:20.360 --> 29:22.240
With friends.

29:22.320 --> 29:24.760
And then, er, at some cheap hotel.

29:24.840 --> 29:27.960
What did you do
with the keycard of your hotel room?

29:29.880 --> 29:33.760
I think I put it, er, in a bowl
on the counter.

29:33.840 --> 29:36.720
You didn't take it with you?

29:38.120 --> 29:42.200
I just said... I put it in a bowl
on the counter.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.920
No, you said you thought
you put it in a bowl on the counter.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
Well...

29:47.280 --> 29:48.800
I did.

29:53.560 --> 29:57.280
Can you please tell me
what you were...

29:57.360 --> 29:59.320
doing on those dates?

30:03.840 --> 30:04.960
I can't.

30:06.200 --> 30:08.120
I'm not keeping a diary.

30:13.360 --> 30:16.600
What about these images?
Do you recognise any of...

30:16.680 --> 30:18.520
any of these people?

30:48.600 --> 30:49.880
They are dead.

30:53.040 --> 30:55.120
I recognise them from the paper.

30:56.280 --> 30:58.720
Okay, so the landlady
couldn't give him an alibi

30:58.800 --> 31:00.680
for the attempted attack
on Walter Davies.

31:00.760 --> 31:03.000
-And he's been in a fight recently.

31:03.080 --> 31:05.040
Some employer,
but she doesn't know who or when.

31:05.120 --> 31:07.600
Find out, see if we can hold him on GBH
if we don't get anything else.

31:07.680 --> 31:08.680
Okay.

31:08.760 --> 31:09.880
<i>And why</i>
<i>do you think you're here?</i>

31:09.960 --> 31:10.960
<i>A pair of size nine footprints</i>

31:11.040 --> 31:13.120
<i>were found at the scene</i>
<i>of an attempted murder,</i>

31:13.200 --> 31:14.440
<i>along with your keycard.</i>

31:14.520 --> 31:18.080
And your arrival into the UK
coincides with five separate killings.

31:21.160 --> 31:23.840
Do you want to try and remember
just that little bit harder?

31:48.080 --> 31:50.240
You're late.

31:50.320 --> 31:51.880
Come in.
She's taking a nap.

31:51.960 --> 31:53.240
Want a cuppa?

31:56.680 --> 31:58.480
Your daughter made them.

32:05.240 --> 32:07.200
May was a little worried today.

32:08.880 --> 32:11.480
She must have overheard
something at her mum's.

32:11.560 --> 32:13.280
What was she saying?

32:14.400 --> 32:17.400
That Mum wasn't gonna let her
see Dad any more.

32:20.040 --> 32:21.640
Look, Ronnie...

32:21.720 --> 32:24.800
I can loan you the money
to make up defaulted payments.

32:24.880 --> 32:27.400
Thanks, but you're already
babysitting for free...

32:28.640 --> 32:29.880
and that would just be
another debt.

32:29.960 --> 32:32.800
But I won't take May away from you
if you don't pay me.

32:34.120 --> 32:36.080
I need to fix this myself.

32:37.040 --> 32:38.360
But thank you.

32:42.960 --> 32:44.000
-Mmm.

32:46.680 --> 32:47.960
What happened?

32:48.040 --> 32:50.720
A witness saw it
parked here last night.

32:50.800 --> 32:53.520
It was still here again this morning,
so he had a look inside. Driver shot.

32:53.600 --> 32:56.080
-Yeah.

32:56.160 --> 32:57.520
That's why we got it.

32:57.600 --> 32:59.920
But you said he didn't see anything.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
He didn't.

33:01.080 --> 33:02.760
He was outside Gibson's house
the night she died,

33:02.840 --> 33:03.840
now he's dead.

33:03.920 --> 33:05.760
We don't think that's a coincidence?

33:07.040 --> 33:08.400
No, we don't.

33:15.320 --> 33:21.960
He's dead.
Dead. I found him dead.

33:23.840 --> 33:25.280
I don't know.

33:30.080 --> 33:32.800
He went to speak to the snakes
and now he's dead.

33:34.720 --> 33:38.480
I'm going to find out who did this.

34:12.080 --> 34:14.000
Just, er, thinking
of a picture for the funeral.

34:15.920 --> 34:17.240
Do you have a favourite?

34:18.800 --> 34:19.800
No.

34:24.640 --> 34:27.160
I think you should probably choose.

34:30.360 --> 34:32.480
Stephen.

34:33.960 --> 34:36.360
We have sorted Lambeth.

34:43.880 --> 34:46.760
Green space, sustainability,
accessibility,

34:46.840 --> 34:49.120
and we still make
more than decent money.

34:50.680 --> 34:52.200
You and Jason?

34:52.280 --> 34:54.520
Me and Jason.
Couldn't have done it without him.

34:55.320 --> 34:56.320
It stays on schedule,

34:56.400 --> 34:58.320
and there's no grounds
for Andrew Barnes or anyone else

34:58.400 --> 35:00.160
to blacklist us from future projects.

35:11.040 --> 35:12.200
Well, that's wonderful.

35:13.800 --> 35:15.000
Wonderful enough?

35:21.120 --> 35:22.480
Then I'll be on my way.

35:23.120 --> 35:24.440
Thank you.

35:26.360 --> 35:28.800
-I'll see you tomorrow.
Mmm-hmm.

35:33.400 --> 35:36.560
Are you bringing
Jason Backland back?

35:37.920 --> 35:39.760
Who would have thought it? Hmm.

35:39.840 --> 35:41.920
He offered his services...

35:43.280 --> 35:44.800
But I used him.

35:46.160 --> 35:47.800
You're the one bringing him back.

35:58.160 --> 35:59.200
Talk to me about Krol.

35:59.280 --> 36:01.400
He doesn't remember his whereabouts
for any of the murders.

36:01.480 --> 36:04.720
Er, Premier Lodge are gonna send over
their CCTV from their reception.

36:04.800 --> 36:06.440
From when the keycard was last used.

36:06.520 --> 36:09.320
I, erm... I checked out
the dead taxi guy.

36:09.400 --> 36:11.120
You're not very good with names,
are you, Mark?

36:11.200 --> 36:14.800
I am, but... when I say a name
like Hassan El-Sayed,

36:14.880 --> 36:16.040
people usually go, "Who's that?"

36:16.120 --> 36:17.840
and then I have to explain
that that's the dead taxi guy.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.160
I'm just being quick.

36:19.240 --> 36:20.720
What about the taxi driver?

36:21.760 --> 36:25.320
Right, Hassan El-Sayed,
born in Morocco, 1986.

36:25.400 --> 36:27.560
Comes to the UK in 2004.

36:27.640 --> 36:30.960
He's granted UK citizenship in 2009.

36:31.040 --> 36:33.520
Erm, he works at Canalside Cabs,
as we know.

36:33.600 --> 36:36.280
He was also hired by another company,
Camden Station Cabs.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.040
Right, so he was ambitious.

36:38.120 --> 36:40.840
That's what I thought.
And then I looked into his family.

36:40.920 --> 36:43.160
His brother, Mohammed El-Sayed,

36:43.240 --> 36:46.480
he comes to the UK about
a year ago on a tourist visa.

36:46.560 --> 36:48.040
That ran out four months ago,

36:48.120 --> 36:49.760
and there's no record of him
leaving the country.

36:49.840 --> 36:52.400
Around about the same time
that Hassan takes the second job

36:52.480 --> 36:53.800
at the second cab firm.

36:53.880 --> 36:57.040
So, I checked,
the night we know he was working,

36:57.120 --> 36:59.800
the night he was
outside Grace Gibson's house...

36:59.880 --> 37:01.840
he took out a cab from each company.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.520
Okay, so we got two drivers,

37:03.600 --> 37:05.960
one licence. Clearly, his brother
was driving the other one, right?

37:06.040 --> 37:08.600
Yeah, and that explains why
he didn't see anything at Grace Gibson's.

37:08.680 --> 37:10.560
-'Cause he wasn't there.
-A potential eyewitness.

37:10.640 --> 37:13.240
Yeah, and he's here illegally,
so he's not gonna come in willingly.

37:13.320 --> 37:14.320
So, let's find him.

37:14.400 --> 37:16.360
He might have seen our killer.

37:21.240 --> 37:23.280
Ah, it's freezin' baby, innit?
-Yeah.

37:26.560 --> 37:28.080
You're so beautiful.

37:32.320 --> 37:33.440
Oh, wow. Yes.

37:33.520 --> 37:35.240
I'm gonna have some of this, please.

37:35.320 --> 37:36.680
What do you mean?

37:40.160 --> 37:42.520
Thank you, baby.
Thank you, okay?

37:43.480 --> 37:44.680
I'm gonna go back in, okay?

37:44.760 --> 37:46.200
But be careful with that.

37:51.960 --> 37:54.440
Excuse me, miss,
what have you got there?

37:54.520 --> 37:56.120
Come on.

37:56.200 --> 37:58.400
-You better come with me. Come on.
-Leave me alone.

38:01.600 --> 38:04.880
Now, if you've cleared your bill,
you don't need to wait in line.

38:04.960 --> 38:07.520
You just put your keycard
in that bowl.

38:07.600 --> 38:09.480
All right. Now.

38:09.560 --> 38:13.040
Confirming what he said.
Bendek Krol drops his key off.

38:13.120 --> 38:15.640
But look, seconds later...

38:15.720 --> 38:17.840
this guy takes a key
out of the bowl.

38:17.920 --> 38:19.280
Is there another angle?

38:20.640 --> 38:22.920
Er... there.

38:24.840 --> 38:25.840
Look at me. Look at me!

38:29.120 --> 38:32.800
I need to see his face!
-He knows where the cameras are.

38:32.880 --> 38:34.600
He's our suspected killer. Dropped the card at Walter Davies'?

38:36.480 --> 38:38.200
Yep.
-Oh, fuck.

38:40.960 --> 38:42.360
Remember Lea Coombes?

38:43.200 --> 38:44.840
Yeah, Cara's flatmate.

38:44.920 --> 38:46.840
Cara's flatmate. She's here.

38:48.880 --> 38:50.840
Cara gave you this as a present?

38:50.920 --> 38:52.560
Didn't realise it was stolen.

38:52.640 --> 38:54.080
I thought it was a proper gift.

38:54.160 --> 38:57.440
As in one she actually picked out
and paid for, like a normal person.

39:00.080 --> 39:02.960
Do you know if she stole anything
from anyone else around that time?

39:03.640 --> 39:05.600
Yeah, a watch and some earrings.

39:07.600 --> 39:09.240
And a bracelet, I think.

39:11.720 --> 39:13.520
You said the person
she stole from is dangerous.  Thanks very much, Lea.
You can go now.

39:17.640 --> 39:20.040
Thanks. And take care, okay?

39:29.040 --> 39:30.560
The trophies from the pawnshop.

39:32.240 --> 39:33.240
Yeah.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.400
So, Cara sleeps with the killer,

39:36.480 --> 39:38.520
steals the necklace,
and is killed because of it.

39:39.720 --> 39:41.560
Provided that is Grace's.

39:41.640 --> 39:43.760
I mean, she had cocaine
in her bloodstream when she died.

39:43.840 --> 39:45.760
If we can prove
it's Grace's necklace,

39:45.840 --> 39:48.400
she must have been
murdered by our killer.

39:49.560 --> 39:50.880
Think it could be hers?

39:52.000 --> 39:53.280
If I'm lucky...

40:07.800 --> 40:10.440
Oh, please.
Oh, please.

40:22.400 --> 40:24.000
Please, God. Please, God.

40:39.200 --> 40:40.920
I didn't do it.

40:50.560 --> 40:51.680
Oh, my God.

40:54.400 --> 40:56.280
Oh, my God, it wasn't me.

41:38.360 --> 41:40.320
Sweet dreams, princess.

42:38.720 --> 42:40.360
Jason Backland.

42:40.440 --> 42:41.920
<i>Jason.</i>

42:42.000 --> 42:44.320
Yeah, hi, Stuart.
What is it?

42:45.240 --> 42:48.200
<i>I've got rid</i>
<i>of your Lambeth problem...</i>

42:48.280 --> 42:49.800
<i>Andrew Barnes.</i>

42:52.640 --> 42:55.360
I spoke to DTG earlier.
It's sorted. So...

42:55.440 --> 42:58.200
<i>What do you mean, got rid of?</i>

42:58.280 --> 43:00.840
<i>Just what you asked me to do.</i>
-Stuart, what...

43:06.480 --> 43:07.840
Fuck!

43:32.080 --> 43:33.240
May?

43:34.760 --> 43:35.880
May! Princess?

43:50.200 --> 43:51.200
Beth! May!

43:59.440 --> 44:00.440
May! May!

44:10.480 --> 44:11.640
May! May.

44:24.600 --> 44:25.600
May!
