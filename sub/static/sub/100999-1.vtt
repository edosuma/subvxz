WEBVTT

00:00.040 --> 00:01.319
Previously on Condor...

00:01.445 --> 00:05.105
Without real power, you
cannot make a dent in this world.

00:05.195 --> 00:05.935
What's going on, Sam?

00:06.160 --> 00:08.545
You wrote a program to assess
likely terrorists targets.

00:08.635 --> 00:09.935
We flagged this
guy, Omar Nasary.

00:10.060 --> 00:13.295
A man we suspect of being a
terrorist is about to walk a package

00:13.385 --> 00:15.995
into a football stadium packed
with 80,000 American souls.

00:16.403 --> 00:17.133
You're going to kill him?

00:17.234 --> 00:18.074
That's why you're here.

00:19.215 --> 00:20.460
What are you doing
with my phone?

00:20.460 --> 00:21.200
I'm on Tinder.

00:21.200 --> 00:21.943
No, no, no.

00:22.033 --> 00:24.035
Kathy H is going
to change your life.

00:24.263 --> 00:28.559
Yesterday countless American
lives were saved because of this group.

00:32.487 --> 00:33.227
C'mon!

00:33.317 --> 00:36.081
It appears the shooter
was Joseph Turner.

00:36.207 --> 00:36.947
What the fuck is that?

00:37.037 --> 00:39.159
...is still at large and
presumed to be dangerous.

00:39.285 --> 00:41.061
Joe had nothing to do
with what happened today.

00:41.151 --> 00:43.611
You recruited him,
you trained him.

00:43.700 --> 00:45.330
I know it's asking a
lot for you to step aside

00:45.420 --> 00:47.832
and let Marty Frost
handle this investigation.

00:47.981 --> 00:49.605
Something bad happened at work.

00:49.746 --> 00:50.500
What was it your fault?

00:50.700 --> 00:51.440
Yeah.

00:52.400 --> 00:53.190
Can you fix it?

00:53.355 --> 00:54.935
I don't think so.

00:55.060 --> 00:55.800
Get in!

00:57.620 --> 00:59.200
You are my best
friend and I love you.

01:02.355 --> 01:03.095
Dad's gone.

01:04.822 --> 01:05.700
Joe, are you okay?

01:05.790 --> 01:07.965
I wrote an algorithm
that found Ommar Nazari.

01:08.135 --> 01:11.235
There's a plot to release
a plague virus at the Hajj.

01:11.260 --> 01:12.975
My entire office has
been killed because of it.

01:13.207 --> 01:15.218
There's a woman
with long black hair.

01:15.243 --> 01:17.566
If you come across her,
you fucking run.

01:17.591 --> 01:19.191
She's up there, she's up there.

01:23.050 --> 01:23.790
Kathy?

01:24.185 --> 01:24.925
I'm sorry...

01:25.050 --> 01:28.237
Whenever an event occurs, a
man appears or men appear,

01:28.327 --> 01:31.737
by whose will, the event
seems to have taken place.

01:31.863 --> 01:33.111
They attack is going
to be at the Hajj.

01:33.201 --> 01:36.611
2 million people are gonna be
infected with the plague tomorrow.

01:36.737 --> 01:38.145
I'm handling it, Joe.

01:38.235 --> 01:38.975
How?

01:39.313 --> 01:43.273
How does a person who believes in
God, come up with such a godless plan?

01:43.399 --> 01:45.082
He wants to start
a fucking holy war.

01:45.121 --> 01:47.167
No, I merely want to win
the one we're already in.

01:47.230 --> 01:50.566
I know that you plan to
release plague at the Hajj,

01:50.606 --> 01:52.315
make it look like a boomerang.

01:52.347 --> 01:56.168
Marty Frost had a dossier of classified
information on a dead man's switch.

01:56.231 --> 01:59.332
We need to do something, or
a lot of people are gonna die.

01:59.395 --> 02:02.262
If anything happened to her...

02:02.293 --> 02:04.161
the whole thing will come out.

02:04.186 --> 02:08.699
I once asked you, the number
of lives that would've to be saved

02:08.731 --> 02:12.986
for you to be willing to
sacrifice a single human being.

02:13.009 --> 02:15.238
You can go pick a number, Laura.

02:18.178 --> 02:19.308
Bye Bob.

02:20.098 --> 02:25.004
I heard you left the agency. All
that guilt finally caught up to you?

02:25.130 --> 02:26.800
I am not a threat to the agency.

02:27.190 --> 02:28.479
They might think
you want revenge...

02:28.605 --> 02:31.354
What is this? You trying to show
me how easy It's to get to me?

02:31.480 --> 02:34.370
Isn't it obvious? You're
the one who got away, Joe.

03:00.198 --> 03:01.298
Come on.

03:25.138 --> 03:26.318
Careful.

03:39.118 --> 03:41.461
Something's wrong.
What is the problem?

03:42.727 --> 03:46.249
If that was a dirty bomb, the meter
would be going fucking crazy right now.

03:46.375 --> 03:49.089
Well maybe the machine's
broken. Maybe your Intel is bad.

03:50.773 --> 03:52.213
Careful...

03:53.203 --> 03:57.476
I'm telling you, you are more
radioactive than this fucking suitcase.

03:57.867 --> 04:01.382
Then, what the fuck
were they doing here?

04:20.516 --> 04:23.173
Take our bodies with
you, leave theirs behind.

04:23.298 --> 04:27.318
And the suitcase? 
- It's empty.

04:32.268 --> 04:34.228
Ah...shit.

06:09.727 --> 06:11.024
Then carry the 1...

06:18.867 --> 06:20.686
Hey. You got it!

06:20.812 --> 06:22.101
What I get?

06:22.280 --> 06:24.655
No. I'm talking to
Jude. How are you?

06:24.757 --> 06:25.498
How is Prague?

06:25.728 --> 06:28.631
I'm not in Prague,
I'm in Budapest.

06:28.757 --> 06:31.663
What time is it there? 
- We left at 2:00.

06:31.991 --> 06:34.343
When did you turn
into such a night owl?

06:34.343 --> 06:37.210
I woke up and I couldn't
fall back to sleep.

06:37.751 --> 06:39.631
Just hang on a second.
- Sure.

06:41.936 --> 06:44.921
I thought you guys were
doing homework? It's done.

06:45.047 --> 06:46.813
If I check, is it still
gonna be done?

06:46.813 --> 06:47.813
Yep.

06:48.454 --> 06:51.289
What are you watching?
- Swatting videos.

06:51.415 --> 06:53.185
I not even gonna ask...

06:55.238 --> 06:56.591
So what are you
doing in Hungary?

06:56.591 --> 06:57.591
Learning Hungarian.

06:57.681 --> 06:59.091
Hey, Anders, your dad's here.

06:59.217 --> 07:02.276
Hey! Seriously, if it's not a
good time. I...I can call back.

07:02.301 --> 07:05.019
No, I really want to talk to you,
I'm gonna call you right back, okay?

07:05.098 --> 07:09.118
Sure... Bye.

07:13.148 --> 07:15.807
Hey, Mr.Crane. Juddo!
What're you up to?

07:16.026 --> 07:17.589
Division.

07:20.622 --> 07:23.099
Hey! Anders will be right up.

07:23.099 --> 07:25.124
Judd, do you wanna 
get ready for bed?

07:25.148 --> 07:28.103
Good night, Mr.Crane. 
- Night, Jude.

07:28.228 --> 07:34.208
How you doin'?
- I'm...pretty well.

07:36.318 --> 07:38.138
Down boy.

07:41.911 --> 07:43.856
Piper's having one of
her parties tomorrow.

07:43.856 --> 07:45.714
 Yeah, I've got the invite...

07:45.738 --> 07:47.372
Thought maybe we
could go together.

07:47.372 --> 07:48.372
 Yeah, no.

07:48.723 --> 07:50.691
You don't wanna
seen in public with me?

07:50.817 --> 07:53.215
I don't want people to think
that we're sleeping together.

07:53.215 --> 07:55.215
But, we are sleeping together.

07:56.558 --> 07:58.888
I'm not ready to go public
with that information.

07:59.872 --> 08:01.821
I mean, I want to shout 
it from the rooftops.

08:01.821 --> 08:02.934
That's 'cause you're a guy.

08:02.997 --> 08:06.715
No, it's because 
I really like you.

08:08.819 --> 08:10.590
You ready kiddo? 
- Yep.

08:11.178 --> 08:15.053
Good night, Mrs.Barber.
- Good night, Mrs.Barber.

08:15.334 --> 08:17.314
Good night, boys.

08:27.108 --> 08:31.128
Hey. How do you say
"Hello" in Hungarian?

08:31.253 --> 08:33.701
Zia. 
- Zia?

08:34.482 --> 08:37.193
Do you like it there? 
- It's okay.

08:37.825 --> 08:39.919
You met anyone,
make any friends?

08:39.919 --> 08:42.114
You know, I've only been 
here a week, right?

08:42.513 --> 08:44.192
Why did you leave Prague?

08:44.192 --> 08:45.472
Time to move on.

08:46.318 --> 08:50.113
You said that about
Florence, Lisbon...Madrid.

08:50.403 --> 08:52.221
I like moving around.

08:52.354 --> 08:53.634
Sounds lonely.

08:53.778 --> 08:55.173
I like that too.

08:55.727 --> 08:58.136
Then why you calling
me at 2:00 in the morning?

09:00.430 --> 09:03.113
Hey! Who is Anders?
- Sammy's best friend.

09:03.531 --> 09:07.159
Then what happened
to...uh..."Brian"?

09:07.159 --> 09:08.679
That was years ago.

09:09.335 --> 09:12.525
Kids aren't very loyal.
Allegiances shift.

09:14.390 --> 09:16.687
So when was the last time
you went out on a date?

09:16.813 --> 09:19.381
When was the last time
you went out on a date?

09:19.381 --> 09:21.610
I'm sleeping with Anders' dad.

09:22.600 --> 09:26.490
It's fucked up but I sleeping
with my son's best friend's father.

09:26.616 --> 09:30.622
Maybe. I don't...don't...
know. Do you like it?

09:30.748 --> 09:34.013
I don't know. Maybe.

09:34.225 --> 09:36.065
uh...how long has
is it been going on?

09:36.065 --> 09:37.377
Couple months.

09:38.381 --> 09:40.303
Then why...why didn't
you say anything?

09:40.303 --> 09:42.888
Because I haven't
seen you in two years.

09:42.912 --> 09:45.442
And you can't expect me to
remember to tell you everything.

09:45.568 --> 09:47.107
Can you tuck me in?

09:47.107 --> 09:49.241
Yeah, I'll be right there, baby.

09:54.396 --> 09:56.357
I know why you can't
sleep at night, Joe.

10:00.192 --> 10:03.554
We did a bad thing to stop
a worse thing from happening.

10:03.680 --> 10:06.760
Oh man! You know, you're
starting to sound like Bob.

10:09.729 --> 10:12.418
You need to stop
punishing yourself.

10:18.148 --> 10:20.198
How do you say
"Goodbye" in Hungarian?

10:20.558 --> 10:22.503
Viszontlรกtรกsra.

10:22.629 --> 10:24.824
Yeah...ha...I'm not
even going to try that.

10:26.777 --> 10:30.188
Let's talk soon, okay? 
- Yeah.

10:32.034 --> 10:34.323
Okay. Ciao. 
- Bye.

10:55.522 --> 10:59.662
I have to meet someone. 
I'll be right back.

11:03.757 --> 11:06.050
You worry too much.

13:12.108 --> 13:15.113
What was so urgent?
I'm under suspicion.

13:15.494 --> 13:16.346
How do you know?

13:16.346 --> 13:18.595
How do you know you
have a itch on your nose?

13:19.799 --> 13:22.862
Tell Partridge I need
an out. No names.

13:22.862 --> 13:24.455
Just stay calm.

13:24.517 --> 13:25.317
Do I not seem calm?

13:28.568 --> 13:29.368
Just relay the message.

13:49.306 --> 13:52.292
You can't sleep? 
- It's 3:30.

13:54.396 --> 13:56.186
You went to bed at 2:00.

13:59.118 --> 14:00.753
What are you doing today?

14:05.298 --> 14:08.274
It's not the day yet.

14:19.352 --> 14:22.488
Changing the oil
on the Mercedes.

14:22.578 --> 14:23.824
Oh?

14:26.316 --> 14:29.009
Playing tennis with Carol.

14:35.108 --> 14:38.182
And waiting for my
husband to finally retire.

14:39.475 --> 14:43.025
If that's what you wanted, you shouldn't
have married such a young man.

14:46.128 --> 14:50.908
But I'll think
about it...I promise.

14:52.902 --> 14:54.978
If you think about it...

14:57.098 --> 14:59.138
you'll never do it.

15:00.724 --> 15:04.198
Just...retire today.

15:15.974 --> 15:18.208
It's not today, yet.

17:17.849 --> 17:20.843
We heard shots. Is
everything all right?

18:13.108 --> 18:15.898
Good day. What will it be?

18:16.024 --> 18:19.308
A coffee please. 
- Certainly.

18:37.553 --> 18:39.858
Here you are. 
- Thank you.

18:42.491 --> 18:46.023
Where are you from? 
- Uh...the States.

18:46.373 --> 18:47.709
Ah! That explains
your Hungarian.

18:47.709 --> 18:48.909
Is it that bad?

18:49.228 --> 18:53.138
Not too bad. Maybe you just
need to practice with someone.

18:54.693 --> 18:56.860
I have the rest of the day off.

19:00.138 --> 19:02.128
Maybe another time.

19:08.864 --> 19:12.009
You must be very
determined to be alone.

20:13.338 --> 20:15.401
Sure you don't want me to drive?

20:15.705 --> 20:19.424
No. I like the way the cool
sidewalk feels on my feet.

20:20.580 --> 20:22.526
What made you change
your mind about the party?

20:24.127 --> 20:27.501
I was on the phone with a friend of mine
last night telling him to get over his shit.

20:27.627 --> 20:30.110
I realized maybe I was
being a bit hypocritical.

20:30.236 --> 20:33.143
Oh yeah? What kind of shit are
you having trouble getting over?

20:33.954 --> 20:37.338
If I talk about it, there
wouldn't be any trouble.

20:42.618 --> 20:47.267
You know...I cheated on my
ex-wife after Anders was born.

20:48.735 --> 20:53.876
And she found out about it in a very
embarrassing way for both of us.

20:56.165 --> 20:58.930
I know you were betrayed by Sam,

20:59.024 --> 21:03.369
and how hurt you must have felt
because I've caused that kind of pain.

21:04.696 --> 21:09.298
But because of that I'll never be careless
with someone's heart, ever again.

21:41.238 --> 21:43.324
- Ah! Mae.

21:43.324 --> 21:45.824
Tracy
- Hi Eva.

21:46.152 --> 21:50.377
I called Gordon to tell him we'd be coming
together, so that it would not be weird.

21:50.503 --> 21:54.612
Not weird. Not weird
at all. Come on in.

21:55.213 --> 21:58.108
Place looks great! 
- Thank you.

21:59.253 --> 22:01.486
Ah. Okay...so Gordon's
manning the bar.

22:01.612 --> 22:04.806
Tracy, why don't you go get Mae
a drink so we can talk about you.

22:04.831 --> 22:06.690
White... beer... something hard?

22:06.690 --> 22:09.086
Ah...white wine will
be great. Thank you.

22:09.110 --> 22:11.016
Maybe something
harder a little later.

22:11.016 --> 22:12.581
Please don't do this right now.

22:12.620 --> 22:13.204
What?

22:13.204 --> 22:15.937
You'd rather wait till
I've had more to drink?

22:15.962 --> 22:17.267
There he is.

22:17.455 --> 22:19.221
How are you?

22:19.221 --> 22:22.025
Abe's given me a third-degree.

22:22.072 --> 22:25.205
Just act nonchalant, okay?

22:25.205 --> 22:26.939
What's she like it in bed?

22:28.531 --> 22:29.638
Your wife?

22:29.638 --> 22:32.505
Wow! Okay, you 
must really like her.

22:32.548 --> 22:34.970
All right dude,
so don't be an asshole.

22:34.970 --> 22:37.170
I'm sorry. I've got a
big head starting here.

22:38.138 --> 22:39.431
Rough day at work.

22:39.431 --> 22:41.829
Well...what are you having?

22:57.446 --> 22:59.157
Why you following me?

22:59.157 --> 23:01.883
I work with your Uncle Bob.

23:06.108 --> 23:08.688
Bob Partridge and I
don't talk. Don't follow.

23:09.678 --> 23:12.023
Please. My name is Vasily Sirin.

23:12.148 --> 23:14.620
I was SVR, funneling 
intel to your uncle.

23:14.620 --> 23:16.294
He told me he had a
nephew in Europe and

23:16.318 --> 23:19.007
I should find you if ever I
couldn't go through the channels.

23:19.141 --> 23:22.219
I assume he told you about me and I
was surprised when you didn't recognize me.

23:22.219 --> 23:24.476
No. You speak English
better than you understand it.

23:24.522 --> 23:27.030
A senior CIA officer has
been turned by the SVR.

23:27.109 --> 23:28.380
Information leaked by him

23:28.380 --> 23:31.353
has already resulted in the
deaths of several American assets.

23:31.377 --> 23:35.033
I can give the agency this man's identity
in exchange for my safety, please.

23:35.158 --> 23:38.502
There has already been one attempt on
my life and you are my only contact.

23:38.627 --> 23:40.736
Yeah? Then you have one
less contact than you thought.

23:40.862 --> 23:43.100
All I'm asking is that
you make a phone call.

23:46.118 --> 23:48.400
Don't follow me.

23:49.288 --> 23:55.327
I will at Kalman Imre 19 for the
next 24 hours. Kalman Imre 19.

23:55.983 --> 24:01.357
I once ate an entire
thanksgiving meal by myself.

24:01.483 --> 24:02.341
I believe that.

24:02.341 --> 24:04.294
I'm surprised you
only did it only once.

24:04.318 --> 24:05.318
Fuck you! Drink. What!?

24:05.908 --> 24:08.916
OK! Really, you mean to tell 
me that you've never eaten

24:08.916 --> 24:11.077
a entire thanksgiving
meal by yourself?

24:11.101 --> 24:13.491
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is what I live with.

24:15.463 --> 24:19.971
I once went to a death
metal music festival.

24:20.108 --> 24:23.869
Lie!
- Drink. It is true.

24:24.003 --> 24:27.573
Gordon took me on our first
day in college. So romantic.

24:27.652 --> 24:29.048
Very romantic.

24:29.113 --> 24:30.535
I've never been roller-skating.

24:30.560 --> 24:32.080
Okay. That's a lie.

24:32.231 --> 24:34.848
Drink. 
- You've never roller-skated?

24:34.938 --> 24:36.644
Drink. 
- We're going roller skating.

24:36.770 --> 24:39.582
I didn't loose my
virginity until I was 23.

24:39.708 --> 24:43.198
That's appropriate, but by
the looks of it, completely true.

24:44.665 --> 24:48.730
I lost my virginity to my mother's
best friend when I was 14...

24:48.774 --> 24:51.679
No way! 
- Yes way. Drink!

24:51.704 --> 24:52.625
Yes!! That's why
he's such a perv!

24:52.665 --> 24:57.313
No, that's so bad...
- It's...pretty cool.

24:57.999 --> 24:58.739
Oh my God!

24:58.829 --> 25:01.429
I can say the alphabet backwards. 
- Bullshit.

25:01.555 --> 25:07.610
Z Y X W V U T S R Q P O
N M L K J I H G F E D C B A.

25:07.743 --> 25:09.053
And you may drink.

25:13.198 --> 25:17.458
I'm in the mile high club. 
- Oh! I like that!

25:17.548 --> 25:18.298
You are a slut.

25:19.979 --> 25:23.361
I've kept a log of every book I've
ever read starting when I was 7.

25:23.487 --> 25:26.712
And I've read 1412 books.

25:27.510 --> 25:29.752
Oh, she's a doctor.

25:30.168 --> 25:33.332
Okay, I'm gonna say true. 
- Drink!

25:35.027 --> 25:38.501
She's good. She's good.

25:40.441 --> 25:43.083
I had a twin brother
that died at birth.

25:43.939 --> 25:47.268
A lie. 
- Drink.

25:50.728 --> 25:53.423
I slept with twins. 
- Oh! Wow.

25:54.923 --> 25:58.193
Much better. 
- Yeah. We're back on track.

25:58.853 --> 26:00.946
Thanks for coming.

26:00.971 --> 26:02.158
Twice.

26:09.118 --> 26:12.345
How is he driving right now? 
- Who, Gord?

26:12.556 --> 26:16.213
Gordon is impervious to alcohol. 
- Uh...I am not.

26:17.032 --> 26:19.688
I can't remember
the last time I...

26:19.931 --> 26:22.111
Why did you say the
alphabet backwards?

26:22.111 --> 26:24.184
Well he can say
anything backwards.

26:24.215 --> 26:25.383
Lie. Drink.

26:25.470 --> 26:29.025
Okay, you got me, I'll drink 
when I get home. I will.

26:47.138 --> 26:49.224
Thanks, Gordon. 
- Good night, Mae.

26:49.249 --> 26:50.477
'Night.

27:01.178 --> 27:04.158
It wasn't that bad, was it?

27:13.098 --> 27:14.763
Goodnight. 
- Goodnight.

27:20.218 --> 27:22.218
What's on your mind?

27:23.866 --> 27:27.808
Uh...this Ukraine op I've been
running. Went sideways on me.

27:28.108 --> 27:29.096
What happened?

27:30.218 --> 27:33.678
I got some intel that the Russians
were smuggling a dirty bomb into Crimea,

27:33.804 --> 27:38.311
so I got Kiev station to send a guy 
along with an SVR strike team.

27:39.138 --> 27:43.113
They were waiting when the Russians made
landfall, but the whole thing was a setup.

27:43.513 --> 27:46.098
Let me guess, no dirty bomb?

27:47.962 --> 27:50.972
No, it was a head-shot. the Russians
used their own people as bait.

27:51.098 --> 27:54.699
Took out our guy
plus five Ukrainians.

27:54.789 --> 27:55.601
Ah...Jesus!

27:55.691 --> 27:58.995
Yeah, this one hurt.

28:02.158 --> 28:06.102
I don't know how much longer I can
keep doing this shit. Might hang it up.

28:09.697 --> 28:12.415
Yeah, I hear you, pal.

28:13.168 --> 28:16.048
Ever since I started
seeing Mae it's...

28:20.098 --> 28:25.324
She's great, by the way. 
- She is, isn't she?

28:39.178 --> 28:43.535
Oh shit. It's okay.

28:44.218 --> 28:46.031
Don't feel bad, okay!

28:46.031 --> 28:48.905
Wake up. Hey! Wake up. 
Wake up.

28:48.941 --> 28:50.138
Kathy?

29:58.128 --> 29:58.878
Bob?

30:17.208 --> 30:19.208
Hello?

30:47.230 --> 30:49.902
I'm sorry Lily. He
was a good man.

30:50.566 --> 30:55.043
We had our differences, but mostly
we agreed on the important things.

30:55.207 --> 30:56.652
Where's the body?

31:30.138 --> 31:33.183
Hello? 
- Joe, it's Reuel Abbott.

31:34.080 --> 31:35.837
Why the fuck do you
have Bob's phone?

31:35.976 --> 31:41.007
Well... your uncle appears to
have taken his own life tonight.

31:43.198 --> 31:46.093
What? 
- We will need to talk.

31:46.819 --> 31:49.869
Yeah. I need to know why
Bob was trying to call you.

31:51.323 --> 31:53.842
He called you six times.
And I was wondering....

32:08.732 --> 32:11.130
After everything that's happened,
do you think we can just talk?

32:11.256 --> 32:14.451
The last time I checked in, you were
stealing a large sum of money

32:14.476 --> 32:16.765
from my personal bank account.

32:16.858 --> 32:18.820
Fuck! You deserve the the
hell of a lot more than that.

32:18.820 --> 32:21.232
Yeah. The Muslim
charity was a nice touch.

32:21.256 --> 32:24.073
Were you even punished
for what you tried to do? Huh?

32:24.198 --> 32:24.938
Joe, your uncle is dead.

32:25.028 --> 32:30.013
Why don't we put aside our personal
issues and deal with the problem at hand.

32:30.138 --> 32:32.130
Now I understand that you
don't trust me personally,

32:32.220 --> 32:35.723
but I know you don't doubt
my loyalty to the agency.

32:37.138 --> 32:40.258
I need to know why Bob
was trying to reach you.

32:42.850 --> 32:44.434
Fine.

32:46.148 --> 32:48.033
I was approached by... 
- No, not like this.

32:48.158 --> 32:51.525
We're not on a safe channel.
I'm gonna give you an address.

34:12.128 --> 34:14.108
Step back, please.

34:15.148 --> 34:18.034
Welcome to the
American Embassy sir.

34:45.023 --> 34:46.172
Vasily Sirin.

34:46.172 --> 34:49.062
A Colonel in the SVR. Yes.

34:49.183 --> 34:51.589
He's a double, Bob is running him
He's blown.

34:51.614 --> 34:53.264
His own people tried to kill him.

34:53.288 --> 34:54.599
He escaped now and wants to defect.

34:54.599 --> 34:57.607
He says he can identify
the mole within the CIA.

34:59.014 --> 35:01.975
Which means that my uncle didn't kill himself.

35:01.975 --> 35:04.242
Which I suspect you already know.

35:05.030 --> 35:09.233
Sirin will be at Kalman Imre 19
until 6:00 PM this evening.

35:09.686 --> 35:12.073
OK. So now you know
everything that I know.

35:12.334 --> 35:15.497
I'm gonna giving you instructions. 
Do you have a pen?

35:15.623 --> 35:17.818
No, no. I'm making an
introduction. Which I've done.

35:17.818 --> 35:20.193
Now I'm leaving,
I've a funeral to attend.

35:20.217 --> 35:21.506
You say the agency's compromised?

35:21.506 --> 35:24.037
No no. I said that Sirin says
the agency's compromised.

35:24.076 --> 35:26.701
If that's true, then your
uncle isn't the only casualty.

35:26.810 --> 35:30.545
American assets were ambushed
and killed in Ukraine yesterday.

35:30.691 --> 35:32.957
And Vasily Sirin
may be our best lead.

35:32.982 --> 35:35.582
But...I need him here 
in America, safe.

35:35.873 --> 35:37.279
Now Bob trusted
us to handle this.

35:37.279 --> 35:39.177
Not because we get
along well together

35:39.216 --> 35:41.427
but because we're the
only men he'd knew for sure

35:41.427 --> 35:44.094
who weren't compromised by the Russians.

35:44.138 --> 35:45.294
Handle it yourself.

35:45.419 --> 35:48.637
I'm an old man, Joe. I'm
get tired walking up stairs.

35:49.231 --> 35:50.387
I'm not qualified.

35:50.387 --> 35:53.907
No. Your actions have a way
of belying your qualifications.

35:54.153 --> 35:57.887
You're young Joe, you don't understand
the damage Ames did to the agency,

35:58.012 --> 36:00.378
or Robert Hanssen
did to the FBI.

36:00.504 --> 36:04.093
The loss of lives that can be brought about
by one's man actions is just astonishing.

36:04.666 --> 36:10.103
That is a ironic statement coming from a fanatic
who tried to kill millions of innocent people.

36:10.228 --> 36:14.113
I suggest we focus on the American lives
presently in danger that can still be saved.

36:14.238 --> 36:16.168
Is it only American
lives do you care about?

36:16.168 --> 36:19.441
Only? No. Primarily? Yes.

36:22.178 --> 36:25.208
Without your help,
Vasily Sirin is dead.

36:48.198 --> 36:49.964
Hi, aunt Lily.

36:59.911 --> 37:01.114
Of course.

37:04.432 --> 37:05.754
I'm coming home.

37:45.278 --> 37:49.053
What did Bob say? 
- Bob's dead.

37:49.178 --> 37:51.128
They're saying that
he killed himself.

37:51.378 --> 37:54.363
I spoke to the Deputy Director.
Our flight leaves in five hours.

37:54.488 --> 37:56.042
They're sending a plane?

37:56.168 --> 37:58.510
Homeland Security has
been given a story. That.

37:58.636 --> 38:02.022
The agency is pulling one of its own out
of Eastern Europe and that is all I know.

38:02.148 --> 38:05.133
This isn't even me.
- Best we could do.

38:05.259 --> 38:08.832
Are we flying commercial?
- If we're doing this, we are.

38:23.582 --> 38:28.228
Lily...whatever you do, don't talk
too loud, I have a terrible headache.

38:31.359 --> 38:32.800
Oh my God!

38:34.792 --> 38:36.620
Why did you change your mind?

38:37.347 --> 38:38.621
I've been where you are.

38:38.901 --> 38:41.776
I remember, I saw 
it on the news.

38:42.894 --> 38:47.103
A woman I didn't know,
a stranger, helped me.

38:47.493 --> 38:51.423
And it worked out? 
- No, she died.

38:54.339 --> 38:56.581
My uncle did not kill himself.

38:56.581 --> 38:59.503
Which means that this
mole is somehow responsible.

38:59.999 --> 39:02.003
Which means he's
got my attention.

39:07.332 --> 39:08.073
Hey.

39:11.301 --> 39:13.019
Yeah, I heard.

39:14.536 --> 39:16.431
I'm just getting ready to leave.

39:16.683 --> 39:19.203
I meet your aunt. 
- How is she?

39:19.667 --> 39:22.260
Happy you are coming home.

39:22.604 --> 39:24.893
 Are you okay?

39:27.245 --> 39:29.220
Yeah. Yeah.

39:29.635 --> 39:31.112
Are you gonna stay here?

39:31.112 --> 39:33.299
Oh! No, no, I don't think 
that's a good idea.

39:33.357 --> 39:35.658
Stay with us. You can
take Sammy's room.

39:36.096 --> 39:37.276
Okay.

39:38.184 --> 39:41.134
How do you say "see
you soon" in Hungarian?

39:41.274 --> 39:43.988
Hamarosan talรกlkozunk.

39:45.002 --> 39:47.519
You really speak Hungarian.

39:47.979 --> 39:49.714
Maybe I'm making it up.

39:52.480 --> 39:54.570
I'm so sorry, Joe.

39:57.815 --> 39:58.556
Yeah.

40:15.128 --> 40:17.331
No, it's perfect flying west.

40:17.846 --> 40:20.745
It's better to gain
time than to lose it.

40:22.354 --> 40:26.033
We should have a plan to meet up
on other side in case we get separated

40:26.158 --> 40:30.039
or have to meet without
calling attention to ourselves.

40:30.165 --> 40:35.203
Okay. 
- Union Station, Track 12, 20:30.

40:35.759 --> 40:39.193
Why 12? 
- Okay, Track 11.

40:39.982 --> 40:41.992
Champagne? 
- Please.

40:42.118 --> 40:44.228
Uh...water for me, thank you.

40:48.438 --> 40:52.073
You're a good man. 
- I'm trying to be.

40:52.198 --> 40:55.098
In the end that's
all anyone can ask.

40:56.555 --> 40:58.813
Even if it's leads you to
do something unforgivable?

40:58.813 --> 40:59.933
Let's hope so.

41:02.138 --> 41:04.700
Thank you. 
- Thank you.

41:07.764 --> 41:09.584
For fighting the good fight.

41:09.982 --> 41:13.795
And on to your uncle,
also a good man.

41:16.108 --> 41:17.288
Maybe.

42:43.627 --> 42:45.871
Next.

43:32.158 --> 43:33.424
Next.

43:33.723 --> 43:36.673
Welcome home. 
- Thank you.

43:38.650 --> 43:41.541
What now? 
- Now we rent a car.

43:56.118 --> 43:56.970
This is DC.

43:56.970 --> 43:59.547
There are motorcades everywhere.
There's nothing to worry about.

44:02.098 --> 44:05.203
See? Everything is okay.

44:05.902 --> 44:09.800
It's always strange to be
here, behind enemy lines.

44:10.723 --> 44:13.386
Yes, pretty strange for me too.

44:15.345 --> 44:17.229
So, what's the plan?

44:17.229 --> 44:20.095
What are you going to
do with all this freedom?

44:20.683 --> 44:23.589
The dream would be to meet 
a woman, have a few children...

44:23.589 --> 44:25.523
...and open a small business.

44:25.597 --> 44:28.487
Isn't America the big country
of small businesses?

44:29.557 --> 44:33.163
Well, you'll have to look me up
and invite me over for dinner.

44:33.814 --> 44:37.962
The more likely reality is that I'll spend
the rest of my life looking over my shoulder

44:38.088 --> 44:42.045
trying to assimilate into
a vastly different culture.

44:42.171 --> 44:47.168
Eventually drinking myself into the early
grave, like so many other men of my ilk.

44:48.771 --> 44:50.958
Then why go with
all this trouble?

44:51.333 --> 44:52.927
Life clings to life.

44:58.185 --> 45:00.318
What the fuck? Shit.

45:02.198 --> 45:04.248
We have to go.

45:11.258 --> 45:15.338
Joe, you're in the hospital.

45:16.128 --> 45:18.653
You were in car accident.
Do you remember?

45:20.387 --> 45:22.754
Joe, Joe.

45:23.184 --> 45:26.053
We have to go, Joe. 
We have to go.

45:26.178 --> 45:28.103
Joe, Joe. Joe!

45:28.657 --> 45:30.637
Do you know what day it is?

45:32.559 --> 45:34.033
Friday. 
- That's right.

45:34.364 --> 45:37.053
Do you remember
why you came home?

45:37.410 --> 45:39.023
Bob's funeral. 
- Good.

45:39.866 --> 45:42.022
I just spoke to the doctor and
they want to keep you here overnight

45:42.022 --> 45:43.936
which I think that's a good idea.

45:53.819 --> 45:57.996
Are you awake, Joe? 
Because...

45:59.066 --> 46:02.351
there's a couple
things I'd like to ask you.

46:04.934 --> 46:10.103
They came for him
in an ambulance.

46:10.228 --> 46:12.856
They were dressed as EMT's.

46:13.118 --> 46:15.113
And did you see their faces? No.

46:15.371 --> 46:17.040
They kill him?

46:20.665 --> 46:22.460
Not in front of me, but...

46:22.460 --> 46:24.266
Why did they let you go?

46:29.619 --> 46:32.477
I don't know. Why
don't you ask them.

46:34.138 --> 46:39.033
So you came here for your uncle's funeral
and you got into a car accident, so.

46:39.610 --> 46:45.633
Pay your respects and go back to
whatever it is we pulled you away from.

46:45.797 --> 46:49.170
You can't possibly expect me to
go back to what I've been doing

46:49.260 --> 46:50.523
after everything that
has just happened?

46:50.649 --> 46:53.178
Well that's exactly
what I expect you to do.

46:54.407 --> 46:56.337
I made a mistake asking you to do this.

46:56.337 --> 46:59.921
I over-estimated your capabilities,
and I'm sorry, and...

47:00.336 --> 47:01.883
get well.

47:08.969 --> 47:11.703
Are you doing
something for him, Joe?

47:12.148 --> 47:15.173
Were you back
with the agency? No.

47:15.827 --> 47:22.279
Because I went through Bob's phone logs
just to piece together that night, and...

47:22.405 --> 47:24.577
you were the last call he made.

47:25.118 --> 47:27.421
It was only 60 seconds,
but it gave me solace

47:27.421 --> 47:30.429
to think that you and
Bob spoke before he died.

47:30.540 --> 47:32.962
And then I checked the
timing and realized that

47:32.962 --> 47:35.374
you and Bob spoke
an hour after he died.

47:35.398 --> 47:38.982
And then I realized who you
must have been speaking with.

47:41.998 --> 47:44.553
And here I was thinking
you were done with all that.

47:44.553 --> 47:46.143
Aunt Lilly, it's...it's.

47:46.167 --> 47:49.227
But since you're not...

47:50.118 --> 47:52.781
There is something I'd
like you to do for me.

47:53.029 --> 47:54.201
 What?

47:54.607 --> 47:58.404
Bob didn't kill himself.
He was murdered.

47:59.128 --> 48:04.270
And I'll have no peace until his killers are
found and made to pay for what they've done.

48:04.411 --> 48:08.208
Aunt Lily...it's... 
- Do you understand, Joe?
