00:44.960 --> 00:46.359
Not even a goodbye?

00:50.466 --> 00:51.728
Come on in.

00:55.971 --> 00:59.498
Blacklisted before I even graduate.
That's got to be a record.

01:00.342 --> 01:02.537
I don't know who you ticked off
around here...

01:02.711 --> 01:04.507
...but you sure ruffled some feathers.

01:05.247 --> 01:07.977
I have enemies in high places.

01:09.251 --> 01:11.310
Well, we're gonna miss you.

01:11.487 --> 01:14.479
Yeah, right. You're just gonna miss
the free proofreader.

01:14.656 --> 01:17.386
Max, your wife's called
three times about dinner.

01:18.160 --> 01:19.627
Tell her I'm on my way.

01:22.398 --> 01:25.390
-lf there's anything I can ever do--
-Actually....

01:25.734 --> 01:28.931
A few stories I've been working on.
I'd love for you to look at them.

01:29.238 --> 01:32.696
I couldn't print your name
in the classifieds without catching hell.

01:33.675 --> 01:35.666
Well, what about a pseudonym?

01:36.578 --> 01:39.240
She's my cousin.
She won't mind at all.

01:39.415 --> 01:41.508
She's not interested in journalism.

01:44.586 --> 01:46.076
Lois Lane.

02:17.119 --> 02:20.350
I was looking for the on-call tech guy.

02:20.889 --> 02:22.254
Well, you found her.

02:22.658 --> 02:24.649
You work in the tech department?

02:25.027 --> 02:28.724
You'd rather have a PlayStation-addicted
dork wearing a Star Wars T-shirt?

02:32.167 --> 02:34.601
-Molly.
-Lex.

02:36.004 --> 02:38.165
So, what's the crisis, Lex?

02:38.340 --> 02:43.835
Well, I'm trying to finish a presentation,
my program keeps crashing, and...

02:44.046 --> 02:46.207
...I don't have time to deal with it.

02:46.782 --> 02:48.511
Probably a virus.

02:48.684 --> 02:50.208
I would assume so.

03:03.599 --> 03:08.866
I've only been back a few weeks,
but I'm surprised I haven't seen you.

03:09.371 --> 03:11.236
Back from where?

03:12.074 --> 03:15.840
-It's a long story.
-l.e., none of my business.

03:18.146 --> 03:19.977
There we go.

03:22.518 --> 03:24.986
This should scan for any viruses.

03:25.787 --> 03:29.086
Are you a do-it-yourselfer,
or do you need me to do it for you?

03:32.461 --> 03:34.156
I think I can handle it.

04:29.284 --> 04:32.048
Welcome to the Torch...
unplugged.

04:32.254 --> 04:34.051
What happened to my computers?

04:34.556 --> 04:36.786
Bunch of deliverymen
stopped by this afternoon.

04:36.959 --> 04:38.950
LuthorCorp took the computers back.

04:39.461 --> 04:41.588
But they were donated.

04:41.763 --> 04:44.823
Yeah, well,
I guess the Grinch changed his mind.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.060
Oh, yeah, some girl stopped by.
Didn't leave a name.

04:48.937 --> 04:50.928
Thanks, Pete.

06:03.945 --> 06:05.606
Chloe?

07:08.744 --> 07:12.145
Last thing I remember, I was in the library
working on my history paper.

07:12.314 --> 07:13.872
Stone sober.

07:14.049 --> 07:16.677
Miss Sullivan, would you care
to shed any light...

07:16.852 --> 07:19.480
...on Mr. Kent's version of the incident?

07:19.654 --> 07:22.885
What do you mean,
the part where I wasn't eating pavement?

07:24.126 --> 07:26.026
I don't know.

07:29.197 --> 07:33.190
It just....
It looked like he lost control of his truck.

07:36.204 --> 07:41.005
Well, Mr. Kent, your family sure has its way
of going through vehicles.

07:42.577 --> 07:45.171
-Chloe?
-ls that all you need from Clark?

07:48.350 --> 07:50.511
Why don't you go on home.

07:50.685 --> 07:54.212
I got a few more questions
for our Miss Sullivan.

08:11.807 --> 08:14.537
Well, I'm glad you're feeling better, Adam.

08:19.514 --> 08:22.347
Clark, are you okay?
I just heard about the accident.

08:23.018 --> 08:25.748
I'm okay, but Chloe's a little scraped up.

08:30.392 --> 08:32.053
Clark, this is Adam.

08:33.094 --> 08:35.028
Nice to finally meet you.

08:36.431 --> 08:39.525
So you're Clark. Heard a lot about you.

08:39.701 --> 08:42.260
Didn't realize there was that much to say.

08:44.072 --> 08:47.303
-How'd you get here so quickly?
-I was just visiting Adam.

08:47.475 --> 08:49.602
-Physical therapy.
-That's where you met?

08:50.111 --> 08:52.875
Yeah, I thought I'd see you
when you visited Lana, but...

08:54.349 --> 08:56.283
...I guess you got busy.

08:57.352 --> 09:00.082
Looks like we've all been busy.

09:06.795 --> 09:11.459
Since Lex gave me this thing, it's like no
one can change a coffee filter on their own.

09:28.650 --> 09:30.277
Mr. Luthor.

09:30.452 --> 09:33.012
-Where's Molly?
-Molly?

09:33.188 --> 09:35.713
She was working here last night.
She loaned me this.

09:35.891 --> 09:37.950
I've been looking for that.

09:38.126 --> 09:39.821
We don't have a Molly.

09:39.995 --> 09:42.987
I was the one on call last night.
From home.

09:43.164 --> 09:46.099
She was here unpacking
these computer boxes.

09:48.236 --> 09:52.935
Huh. Well, that might explain
how all those hard drives got wiped out.

10:04.753 --> 10:07.085
There is a lot going on in that cup.

10:07.255 --> 10:08.722
It's your first time here...

10:08.890 --> 10:11.654
...and I'm trying really hard
to get the thumbs-up.

10:13.528 --> 10:16.224
This place has really been a refuge for me.

10:16.398 --> 10:17.797
Refuge from what?

10:18.166 --> 10:19.827
Oh, just everything.

10:20.001 --> 10:22.469
It was interesting meeting Clark.

10:26.007 --> 10:27.770
We're just friends.

10:28.443 --> 10:30.172
Just friends?

10:30.946 --> 10:34.109
For friends, you're very
uncomfortable around each other.

10:34.649 --> 10:37.516
Yeah, well, we've got a lot of history.

10:38.186 --> 10:40.746
I saw the way he looked at you.

10:44.025 --> 10:46.289
Clark doesn't know what he wants.

10:46.895 --> 10:50.490
Besides, I can't control the way he feels.

10:53.535 --> 10:55.730
And...you?

10:57.372 --> 11:01.866
Clark will always be
a very important part of my life...

11:02.644 --> 11:06.410
...but whatever there was between us,
it's gone.

11:24.566 --> 11:27.933
If you're looking for signs of tampering,
I'll save you some time.

11:28.103 --> 11:30.833
There's nothing wrong with it.
I asked the mechanic.

11:31.006 --> 11:33.099
There's gotta be some explanation.

11:34.509 --> 11:36.636
As to why you tried to mow me over?

11:38.613 --> 11:40.376
I'm ready and waiting.

11:40.682 --> 11:42.877
Didn't you tell the sheriff I lost control?

11:43.118 --> 11:46.884
I was covering for you, Clark.
You chased me onto the sidewalk.

11:48.089 --> 11:51.354
I know you're still upset
about the whole Lionel thing...

11:51.526 --> 11:54.893
...but don't you think manslaughter
is beyond "eye for an eye"?

11:55.296 --> 11:57.230
You don't think I tried to hurt you?

11:57.432 --> 12:01.562
I don't know,
but the way you've been acting lately....

12:01.736 --> 12:05.331
I don't know, Clark.
I can only apologize so many times.

12:06.941 --> 12:10.035
I have been having a hard time
getting over this.

12:10.445 --> 12:13.642
Every time I see you, I can't help
picturing you and Lionel talking.

12:16.284 --> 12:17.979
You're not the same person you were.

12:18.486 --> 12:21.580
Like if I moved to Metropolis,
became a biker party animal...

12:21.756 --> 12:25.089
...and told you to get out of my life.
Like that, right?

12:28.830 --> 12:30.730
Look, you know what?

12:31.466 --> 12:33.161
As much fun as this guilt trip is...

12:33.334 --> 12:37.430
...I came here to see if you put any more
pieces together from last night.

12:39.841 --> 12:41.741
What happened after the library?

12:43.011 --> 12:45.980
I don't even remember leaving the library.

12:46.147 --> 12:49.605
The last thing I do remember,
I was working on my laptop.

13:06.768 --> 13:09.532
Well, the computer recovered your paper.

13:10.805 --> 13:13.638
That's an interesting take
on General Sherman.

13:16.878 --> 13:19.142
I didn't even finish my sentence.

13:23.184 --> 13:27.814
It says I downloaded an e-mail
before the accident, but it won't open.

13:29.891 --> 13:32.655
Who's Brainwave?

14:03.892 --> 14:07.225
Remind me again
what your school mascot is.

14:07.629 --> 14:10.223
Wait, it's a bird.

14:11.232 --> 14:15.794
Okay, it's a small town.
We take our school spirit very seriously.

14:15.970 --> 14:17.335
I forgot my history book.

14:17.505 --> 14:19.803
-Meet you outside?
-Okay.

15:17.232 --> 15:18.961
Lana. I've been looking for you.

15:28.243 --> 15:31.371
-Lana, what are you doing?
-Killing Chloe Sullivan.

16:49.624 --> 16:51.023
What happened?

17:00.335 --> 17:03.395
We can rule out paranoia.
Someone is trying to kill me.

17:03.571 --> 17:05.232
Not just someone.

17:05.406 --> 17:07.874
Either way,
it still doesn't look great for me.

17:08.041 --> 17:09.873
Chloe, I'm so sorry.

17:10.044 --> 17:12.877
-I can't believe I went after you like that.
-Yeah.

17:14.449 --> 17:17.077
I can't believe you got us suspended.

17:17.251 --> 17:19.242
Thankfully, Adam was there.

17:19.420 --> 17:22.651
Those were some really nice moves.
Was that, kung fu, judo?

17:23.657 --> 17:25.387
I don't know.

17:27.028 --> 17:29.496
I guess I watched a few
too many Jackie Chan movies.

17:30.398 --> 17:34.164
Who'd have thought it'd come in handy
in the halls of Smallville High?

17:36.437 --> 17:39.065
Just before this,
did you get any weird e-mails?

17:39.240 --> 17:40.730
Let me check.

17:41.142 --> 17:44.111
I did, but I don't remember opening it.

17:47.281 --> 17:50.682
The same thing happened to both of us.
It's like we were hypnotized.

17:51.252 --> 17:52.617
A subliminal message?

17:52.787 --> 17:55.415
Maybe something hidden
in the binary codes.

17:55.590 --> 17:57.251
Well, how did I snap out of it?

17:57.425 --> 18:02.089
I'm more concerned with what triggered
the "Kill Chloe" impulse in the first place.

18:02.530 --> 18:03.792
It's Brainwave again.

18:12.206 --> 18:17.166
Every computer online has an lP address.
We should be able to track the message...

18:17.345 --> 18:19.779
...to the computer that it was sent from.

18:19.947 --> 18:21.505
You can do that?

18:21.682 --> 18:23.809
We'll see.

18:23.985 --> 18:26.010
If this Brainwave person
wanted me dead...

18:26.187 --> 18:30.089
...why didn't they just send me
a message saying to off myself?

18:30.258 --> 18:32.317
The brain's hardwired to stay alive.

18:32.493 --> 18:36.122
Not even hypnotic messages
can override our survival instincts.

18:36.397 --> 18:38.831
What, did you just pick that up somewhere?

18:39.434 --> 18:41.834
I was in physical rehab for months.

18:42.003 --> 18:44.494
What else is there to do but read?

18:52.780 --> 18:55.772
Chloe, the message came
from your computer.

18:55.950 --> 18:58.544
I thought Lionel took back
all of your computers.

18:58.986 --> 19:02.581
Why would anyone at LuthorCorp
want to attack you?

19:05.026 --> 19:07.290
I hate to think
you wasted a trip here...

19:07.462 --> 19:10.124
...but I doubt my father's
trying to kill Chloe.

19:10.298 --> 19:13.927
Why? He was willing to put
his own son in a mental institution.

19:14.602 --> 19:16.661
You know what he's capable of.

19:16.838 --> 19:21.571
Clark, what reason would he have to go
after a high school reporter from Smallville?

19:23.211 --> 19:25.679
Is there something you're not telling me?

19:26.380 --> 19:29.713
Does this have to do with
the seven weeks I can't remember?

19:29.884 --> 19:32.819
All I know is that Lionel asked you
to fire Chloe's dad.

19:32.987 --> 19:35.080
Look, Clark, that was business.

19:36.290 --> 19:38.190
Contrary to common perception...

19:38.359 --> 19:41.692
...my father isn't behind
every nefarious activity in Smallville...

19:41.996 --> 19:43.964
...and he'd never be that circuitous.

19:44.899 --> 19:49.233
Those e-mails came from Chloe's computer
after it was shipped to LuthorCorp.

19:50.137 --> 19:51.900
Who else would have access?

20:00.147 --> 20:02.638
Dr. Garner.
How are things at Summerholt?

20:02.817 --> 20:04.409
Is everything okay?

20:04.585 --> 20:06.280
No.

20:06.754 --> 20:09.222
I wish I could say it was.

20:09.790 --> 20:13.726
A reporter from the Daily Planet
stopped by today.

20:14.228 --> 20:16.890
His name was Max Taylor.

20:17.331 --> 20:20.198
About that horrible article that girl wrote?

20:21.135 --> 20:22.932
Unfortunately.

20:23.838 --> 20:27.035
I just don't know what I'm going to do
if they shut me down.

20:27.675 --> 20:30.337
Think about all the people that I've helped.

20:30.978 --> 20:33.242
Where will they go?

20:34.248 --> 20:36.409
That's never going to happen.

20:36.584 --> 20:38.347
I don't know.

20:39.186 --> 20:41.848
I just can't seem to get them
to leave us alone.

20:42.924 --> 20:44.755
How can I make them understand?

20:45.293 --> 20:47.227
You can't.

20:47.395 --> 20:49.590
They'll never understand.

20:51.198 --> 20:53.632
I'm just glad
I was able to help you so much.

20:57.705 --> 21:00.572
But if these reporters have their way...

21:01.509 --> 21:04.672
...other patients may not be so lucky.

21:17.625 --> 21:19.286
Are you leaving?

21:21.028 --> 21:23.462
Paroled. Good behavior.

21:24.365 --> 21:28.859
So are you heading back to Metropolis?

21:29.270 --> 21:32.467
Well, I was...sort of thinking about...

21:32.640 --> 21:34.505
...staying in Smallville.

21:36.577 --> 21:38.272
Why?

21:40.881 --> 21:43.907
-That hurt.
-No. I just meant, you know...

21:44.085 --> 21:47.054
...after what I did at the school....

21:47.722 --> 21:51.852
Smallville doesn't seem like the type
of place you'd go to if you could...

21:52.026 --> 21:53.960
...go anywhere.

21:54.228 --> 21:56.822
Actually, it's about
as close to a home as I have.

21:59.533 --> 22:04.197
I was hoping I could spend more time
with a certain coffee shop owner who...

22:04.372 --> 22:08.331
...just happens to have
the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen.

22:11.746 --> 22:14.715
Adam, we don't really know each other.

22:16.517 --> 22:19.384
Wasn't that the point of me staying?

22:21.322 --> 22:23.449
What's the problem?

22:31.098 --> 22:36.627
No one knows martial arts
without remembering where they learned it.

22:37.204 --> 22:39.468
Chloe can't hack a computer
like you can...

22:39.640 --> 22:43.872
...and if you got it all from reading,
then where are the books?

22:47.715 --> 22:50.980
Clark must've really
messed with your head.

22:52.420 --> 22:53.944
Yeah, he did.

22:56.957 --> 23:01.223
-And I won't let that happen again.
-Look, Lana, I like you...

23:01.395 --> 23:03.363
...and I've told you that.

23:04.699 --> 23:08.658
Whatever your problems are, I'm not
gonna stick around to be one of them.

23:14.241 --> 23:16.175
I think you should go.

23:48.409 --> 23:50.070
Chloe.

23:50.478 --> 23:52.639
Clark, don't sneak up on me like that.

23:52.880 --> 23:55.815
Lex told me they found
your old computer at LuthorCorp.

23:55.983 --> 23:58.474
But the hard drive is gone.

23:58.652 --> 24:03.487
-lncluding all of my e-mail addresses.
-He thinks this is who took it.

24:03.657 --> 24:05.887
She may work for Lionel.
Her name's Molly--

24:06.060 --> 24:09.757
Griggs. Yeah, I know,
and for once, the connection isn't Lionel.

24:09.930 --> 24:12.660
I interviewed her for a story I did
a month ago.

24:12.833 --> 24:14.095
About what?

24:14.268 --> 24:16.600
Summerholt Neurological lnstitute.

24:16.771 --> 24:18.762
Summerholt?

24:18.939 --> 24:20.770
Isn't that where Ryan used to be?

24:21.075 --> 24:24.306
Yeah, to study his ESP.
That's why I looked into the place.

24:24.478 --> 24:27.914
He isn't the only patient
held against their will.

24:28.082 --> 24:30.983
His methods
are right out of the Mengele handbook.

24:31.152 --> 24:34.121
-Why was Molly there?
-MlT recruited her at 1 5.

24:34.288 --> 24:38.520
She was a total engineer whiz kid until
she went homicidal on another student.

24:38.726 --> 24:40.717
After her breakdown,
she went to Summerholt.

24:40.928 --> 24:45.126
-But Summerholt isn't a psych ward.
-For megalo-brainiacs, it is.

24:46.734 --> 24:49.168
Why would she want to kill you?

24:49.336 --> 24:53.432
When I talked to her, she was adamant
that Dr. Garner had given her a new life.

24:53.808 --> 24:56.936
I had enough in that article
to shut him down in a second.

24:57.478 --> 24:59.571
Who else knows about this article?

25:01.248 --> 25:02.545
Max.

25:02.716 --> 25:07.050
Chloe, I've seen your Summerholt story.
I think you've got something here.

25:09.123 --> 25:11.421
Slow down.
Threats are a part of the job...

25:11.592 --> 25:13.822
...but I appreciate the heads up.

25:17.231 --> 25:19.290
You'll get used to it.

25:22.837 --> 25:25.032
You need something, Maureen?

25:29.844 --> 25:31.209
Max?

25:35.616 --> 25:37.208
Max?

25:38.385 --> 25:39.716
Max?

25:39.920 --> 25:43.253
Max! No!

25:46.227 --> 25:47.956
Max!

25:54.535 --> 25:57.231
Thanks for letting Chloe stay here, Lex.

25:58.072 --> 26:00.267
Whatever I can do to help.

26:00.875 --> 26:03.309
This is the last place
anybody would look for me.

26:04.879 --> 26:09.043
Chloe, I'm sorry about what happened
to your friend at the Daily Planet.

26:11.518 --> 26:13.577
You must've had Garner over a barrel.

26:15.556 --> 26:19.549
I obviously didn't know
what I was getting myself into.

26:20.828 --> 26:23.592
It just seems to be a nasty habit
I've picked up lately.

26:24.899 --> 26:27.129
So your theory is that...

26:27.301 --> 26:31.169
...Garner has turned Molly
into his own e-mail assassin...

26:31.338 --> 26:32.896
...using hypnotic suggestion?

26:33.073 --> 26:35.098
It's not that far of a stretch.

26:35.276 --> 26:38.245
Summerholt goes from studying the brain
to controlling it.

26:40.381 --> 26:43.214
A pretty amazing breakthrough,
despite the application.

26:43.384 --> 26:47.787
There's no question. When it comes to
brain-warping, Garner's definitely the guy.

26:48.989 --> 26:51.321
-I'm gonna go talk to Garner.
-Clark, don't.

26:51.492 --> 26:54.017
-It's too dangerous.
-I'm not the one he's looking for.

26:54.194 --> 26:56.594
It'll be all right.
Just don't leave the mansion.

26:56.764 --> 26:59.289
I'll call you if I find anything.

27:01.335 --> 27:04.736
Chloe, I have my tech guys
trying to track her.

27:04.905 --> 27:06.964
I'm gonna go see what they've got.

27:07.141 --> 27:09.302
Make yourself at home.

27:34.668 --> 27:36.135
Clark Kent.

27:36.303 --> 27:38.703
You here to abduct
another one of my patients?

27:39.773 --> 27:43.106
I think you'll find security's
increased since your last visit.

27:43.277 --> 27:47.441
-I know what you and Molly are doing.
-Molly.... Griggs?

27:47.614 --> 27:49.343
She left us months ago.

27:49.550 --> 27:51.381
She's sending out hypnotic e-mails.

27:51.552 --> 27:54.146
Not the kind of technology
you get at RadioShack.

27:54.355 --> 27:57.290
Nor Summerholt,
if that's what you're implying.

27:58.525 --> 28:02.461
Molly already killed one reporter who was
about to expose what you're doing here...

28:02.629 --> 28:05.689
...and she's going after another.
It's quite a coincidence.

28:06.800 --> 28:10.668
Mr. Kent, this is a serious
research institute.

28:10.838 --> 28:15.366
I'm not going to involve Summerholt in
some imaginary high school investigation.

28:15.709 --> 28:18.371
I don't think the police
are gonna see it that way.

28:19.380 --> 28:21.109
Dr. Garner?

28:22.149 --> 28:25.516
Cornell, could you show our friend
to the door?

28:51.311 --> 28:54.712
Centennial Tower Apartments.
How may I direct your call?

28:58.218 --> 29:00.277
Apartment 927, please.

29:01.922 --> 29:03.287
Hello?

29:03.590 --> 29:07.219
Molly, something else has come up.

29:15.235 --> 29:17.362
Library.

29:18.705 --> 29:21.674
That's where you'll find
all the books I was reading.

29:22.976 --> 29:25.171
I thought you'd be
on your way to Metropolis.

29:25.345 --> 29:28.439
I was, but I didn't want to
leave things the way we did.

29:28.882 --> 29:31.009
I can be a little abrupt.

29:31.185 --> 29:33.244
That's one way of putting it.

29:34.455 --> 29:36.548
You are driving me nuts!

29:36.723 --> 29:39.920
I can see how strong you are,
then for some stupid reason...

29:40.094 --> 29:44.053
...you retreat into this hurt-little-girl facade.
It's ridiculous.

29:44.665 --> 29:47.065
This is your way of ending things
on better terms?

29:47.234 --> 29:50.397
People here don't say what they think.

29:51.138 --> 29:53.402
I wasn't trying to hide anything from you.

29:54.241 --> 29:57.608
-Then why are you so guarded?
-You have to understand.

29:57.811 --> 30:02.441
There are patches of my life
that I just can't piece back together.

30:02.883 --> 30:06.910
And everyone that could answer
those questions is gone.

30:08.288 --> 30:10.313
It's kind of scary.

30:13.227 --> 30:18.961
Smallville just seemed a little less terrifying
than going to Metropolis on my own.

30:25.572 --> 30:27.699
Crazy ninja girls and all?

30:30.777 --> 30:33.803
Crazy ninja girls and all.

30:36.683 --> 30:40.619
I guess I just was moving a little too fast,
so I'm sorry...

30:40.787 --> 30:44.188
...if I read something
in our friendship that wasn't there.

30:45.225 --> 30:48.661
I think it was a little too early
to tell what was there.

30:51.198 --> 30:52.825
Yeah.

30:56.637 --> 30:58.969
I'm gonna miss my bus.

31:09.483 --> 31:11.678
Lana, l....

31:11.985 --> 31:15.148
I really hope
you find a way to trust people again.

31:17.891 --> 31:21.156
Because you're a really amazing person,
and...

31:21.328 --> 31:24.525
...it'd be a shame not to let someone
get close enough to see that.

31:33.707 --> 31:35.106
Adam, wait.

31:40.314 --> 31:42.680
Were you serious about staying?

31:59.499 --> 32:01.933
I'm starting to get a complex.

32:02.102 --> 32:06.471
Seems all the women I find even remotely
appealing turn out to be psychopaths.

32:10.410 --> 32:12.105
Birds of a feather.

32:14.281 --> 32:16.613
What did Garner do to you?

32:27.127 --> 32:29.425
Lex, what are you doing here?

32:29.963 --> 32:32.090
My tech guy traced her.

32:33.100 --> 32:34.499
And you would be...?

32:38.739 --> 32:40.764
This is what you're using
to hurt my friends?

32:40.941 --> 32:42.135
Get away from that.

32:42.309 --> 32:45.107
Don't protect Garner.
We know he's controlling you.

32:45.279 --> 32:49.079
There's only one person with that ability.
Me. Get away from the computer!

32:49.249 --> 32:50.682
Looking for this, Clark?

32:52.286 --> 32:53.913
How'd you get that?

32:55.422 --> 32:57.117
Birds of a feather.

33:01.495 --> 33:03.588
It wasn't Garner.

33:03.764 --> 33:06.289
You're the one
who developed the program, huh?

33:08.502 --> 33:10.402
I pulled it from your disk drive.

33:10.570 --> 33:12.538
You don't understand.

33:13.974 --> 33:16.670
You don't know what it's like
to be so different...

33:16.843 --> 33:18.936
...to see things other kids can't see...

33:19.112 --> 33:22.479
...to feel and to think about things
they can't even imagine.

33:25.686 --> 33:28.018
Molly, Garner's not helping you.

33:28.188 --> 33:32.318
He made me feel normal,
and I never thought that could happen.

33:37.531 --> 33:41.126
Now, if someone gave you that chance,
wouldn't you protect them too?

33:44.838 --> 33:47.671
Clark, she sent an e-mail
right before we got here.

33:47.974 --> 33:50.465
You recognize the address?

33:54.481 --> 33:56.210
Mom.

33:57.551 --> 33:58.984
Mrs. Kent?

34:00.787 --> 34:02.687
Mrs. Kent, I got your call.

34:05.292 --> 34:06.816
What did Clark find out?

34:37.958 --> 34:39.447
Chloe.

34:40.761 --> 34:42.524
Are you all right?

34:48.702 --> 34:49.964
Clark!

35:23.370 --> 35:25.201
Mom.

35:28.008 --> 35:29.839
What happened?

35:31.178 --> 35:33.146
Are you okay?

35:57.204 --> 35:59.604
Okay, just keep an open mind.

36:08.415 --> 36:11.384
So? What do you think?

36:11.551 --> 36:12.813
I think...

36:12.986 --> 36:16.547
...Norman Bates
would be right at home here.

36:16.723 --> 36:19.988
Not exactly the tenant I had in mind.

36:20.560 --> 36:22.391
Is that an offer?

36:22.562 --> 36:26.896
If we clear out all this junk and paint,
it could be a really cool space.

36:27.067 --> 36:30.559
I negotiated a good deal
on the rent with the owner.

36:32.205 --> 36:35.697
Well, I guess an upside would be
I wouldn't need an alarm clock.

36:37.611 --> 36:39.875
The smell of fresh coffee
would wake me up.

36:40.046 --> 36:42.344
Yeah, unless you're making it.

36:42.516 --> 36:45.747
If you stick around long enough,
I might just put you to work.

36:50.657 --> 36:52.522
I appreciate you doing this for me...

36:52.692 --> 36:55.752
...but I don't want you to do it
because you feel sorry for me.

36:56.062 --> 36:58.963
No. No, that's not what this is about.

36:59.132 --> 37:00.599
Trust me.

37:03.937 --> 37:06.167
I'm just trying to help out a friend.

37:19.386 --> 37:20.876
New computers?

37:21.054 --> 37:23.579
The same old computers. New Luthor.

37:23.757 --> 37:26.692
Lex returned them to me,
no strings attached.

37:26.860 --> 37:30.352
I guess he felt guilty about firing my dad.

37:30.530 --> 37:32.191
At least you're up and running.

37:32.899 --> 37:36.357
-Sans cyber stalker.
-Your soul is still intact.

37:36.603 --> 37:38.230
Yeah.

37:40.974 --> 37:43.670
You know, with all this stuff with Molly...

37:43.843 --> 37:47.040
...there's a part of me
that feels like maybe I deserved it.

37:47.414 --> 37:49.609
-Now, Chloe--
-No, like it was my penance.

37:49.783 --> 37:51.910
For what I did to you.

37:54.754 --> 37:57.120
You can't take all the blame.

37:59.192 --> 38:02.127
You went to Lionel
because I pushed you away.

38:02.295 --> 38:04.559
Seems to be
one of my hidden talents lately.

38:05.231 --> 38:07.165
It's not so hidden.

38:10.370 --> 38:13.862
You know, I never set out
to investigate you, Clark.

38:14.374 --> 38:16.137
It just....

38:16.576 --> 38:21.309
It was so flattering that someone like that
would be interested in my work.

38:22.215 --> 38:25.776
-lt made you feel like you mattered.
-Yeah.

38:26.219 --> 38:30.212
And then Lionel, like, set my dream out
right in front of me, and I just....

38:30.924 --> 38:34.985
I don't know.
I gave in to all my worst instincts.

38:35.161 --> 38:38.619
Chloe, he caught you at a weak moment,
and we all have them.

38:39.366 --> 38:42.028
When you found me at mine in Metropolis...

38:42.569 --> 38:45.094
...you didn't turn your back on me.

38:45.271 --> 38:49.332
You gave me a second chance,
and I at least owe you the same.

38:50.176 --> 38:52.371
I'd like that.

38:55.615 --> 38:59.984
So, what now? I mean, we can't just forget
about everything that's happened.

39:04.290 --> 39:08.659
Well, you have to understand, there are
some things about me that'll never add up.

39:09.729 --> 39:11.856
I know that.

39:14.768 --> 39:17.259
Are you willing to stop digging?

39:20.540 --> 39:22.906
Yeah. I mean, I figure you'll just...

39:23.076 --> 39:25.237
...tell me when you think it's right.

39:27.681 --> 39:29.808
I'll see you tomorrow.

39:29.983 --> 39:31.245
Okay.

39:56.810 --> 39:58.471
Mr. Luthor.

39:58.945 --> 40:03.507
I should've known when Clark stopped by
that you wouldn't be far behind.

40:04.017 --> 40:07.578
Any more attempts
on Chloe Sullivan's life would be...

40:09.222 --> 40:10.883
...ill-advised.

40:12.292 --> 40:15.625
Molly seems to have vanished into thin air.

40:16.329 --> 40:18.763
I don't suppose you'd know
anything about that.

40:19.299 --> 40:22.359
Molly's in the care of people
who will help her...

40:22.535 --> 40:24.366
...not exploit her.

40:24.938 --> 40:26.906
Lex, you're a smart man.

40:27.073 --> 40:32.010
You know that the line has to be bent
now and then in order to make progress.

40:32.712 --> 40:36.375
I believe there's a difference
between bent and broken.

40:38.985 --> 40:41.249
You've never been so close
to making a discovery...

40:41.421 --> 40:45.323
...that you'd be willing to do almost
anything to see it through?

40:46.392 --> 40:50.726
My work could change the way
the world views intelligence, thought.

40:50.897 --> 40:54.094
Your research isn't worth
the cost of innocent lives.

40:55.034 --> 40:58.629
And I don't have time for a morality lesson.
Excuse me.

41:01.574 --> 41:04.873
Chloe's article is a real page-turner.

41:09.349 --> 41:11.749
Almost worth killing over.

41:17.056 --> 41:18.648
Wouldn't you say, doctor?

41:21.795 --> 41:23.592
What do you want, Lex?

41:25.165 --> 41:26.860
Your help.

41:33.807 --> 41:35.399
A few months ago...

41:36.276 --> 41:39.939
...I had an unfortunate session
of shock therapy that...

41:40.113 --> 41:43.514
...basically erased
seven weeks of my life.

41:48.154 --> 41:51.317
I want those seven weeks back.

41:54.000 --> 42:00.000
