00:01.090 --> 00:02.876
Previously on
the <i>"Secret Circle"...</i>

00:02.877 --> 00:04.838
Demons.

00:04.938 --> 00:06.788
Evil entities.
Possession.

00:06.996 --> 00:10.480
Using snakes and insects
as vessels for dark energy.

00:10.482 --> 00:12.699
Demons need human form
to be fully active.

00:13.702 --> 00:15.169
John Blackwell
knows more about

00:15.171 --> 00:16.720
the hunters
than any of us.

00:16.722 --> 00:19.039
If Blackwell's such a huge force
of dark magic,

00:19.041 --> 00:21.374
why didn't he do anything
to stop the witch hunters?

00:21.376 --> 00:23.343
His power was stripped,
like all our parents.

00:23.345 --> 00:25.696
With or without power,
your father can help us.

00:25.698 --> 00:27.181
Eben will be back.

00:27.183 --> 00:29.850
What you did
unleashed a curse.

00:29.852 --> 00:32.019
Birds are a harbinger.

00:32.021 --> 00:34.054
A sign that the curse
has been activated.

00:34.056 --> 00:35.505
If you awaken
the curse,

00:35.507 --> 00:37.608
someone in your circle
will die.

00:37.610 --> 00:39.610
Found a recipe
for an elixir.

00:39.612 --> 00:40.748
When we drink this,

00:40.773 --> 00:42.694
we'll forget how we
feel about each other.

00:44.949 --> 00:48.068
I still love him,
but he doesn't love me.

00:48.070 --> 00:50.020
The elixir really
worked on Adam.

00:54.175 --> 00:55.742
Dude.

00:56.711 --> 00:58.729
All right.
Here's for you.

00:58.731 --> 01:01.098
And here's yours.

01:05.853 --> 01:08.555
Aah!
Heh.

01:08.557 --> 01:10.107
Hi.

01:10.109 --> 01:11.441
Hey.

01:12.560 --> 01:13.977
So, you're like
an old pro.

01:13.979 --> 01:16.263
Well, I learned
from the best.

01:17.598 --> 01:20.384
You taught me how
to hold the tray.

01:20.386 --> 01:22.035
You still remember
that, right?

01:22.037 --> 01:26.039
Yeah,
of course I do.

01:28.209 --> 01:29.743
Yeah. It just

01:29.745 --> 01:31.745
feels like
the whole...

01:31.747 --> 01:34.381
different time.
Different us.

01:34.383 --> 01:36.934
You know?

01:36.936 --> 01:40.304
Um, I should--
I should go.

01:40.306 --> 01:41.888
I'll see you later.

01:44.259 --> 01:47.644
I can't look away. It's like
an emotional car crash.

01:47.646 --> 01:49.056
Except they both don't
know they're the victims.

01:49.081 --> 01:49.897
So big deal.

01:49.898 --> 01:51.465
They loved each other.

01:51.467 --> 01:53.150
And then,
they drank one potion,

01:53.152 --> 01:54.768
and now, it's like
they never felt anything.

01:54.770 --> 01:56.136
Don't you think
that's tragic?

01:56.138 --> 01:58.355
Tragic was the way
Adam followed

01:58.357 --> 02:00.757
her dark highness around
like a puppy dog.

02:00.759 --> 02:02.075
He's better off.

02:02.077 --> 02:03.493
Faye, they sacrificed
their love

02:03.495 --> 02:05.478
so one of us
wouldn't die.

02:05.480 --> 02:07.314
Show
a little gratitude.

02:07.316 --> 02:08.865
I'm grateful...

02:08.866 --> 02:11.868
That I never have to see Adam
bat his oversized lashes

02:11.870 --> 02:14.655
at her undersized head
ever again.

02:14.657 --> 02:17.424
Sorry for the wait.

02:17.426 --> 02:19.593
Are you ok?

02:19.595 --> 02:23.663
I just--the whole thing
with Adam must be so horrible.

02:23.665 --> 02:27.100
Oh, no, no.
I'm fine.

02:27.102 --> 02:29.502
Yeah. I mean,
it's just kind of like

02:29.504 --> 02:31.305
seeing your ex
and forgetting why

02:31.307 --> 02:33.506
you ever had feelings for
for them.

02:33.508 --> 02:35.942
I mean, it's
more confusing than sad.

02:35.944 --> 02:38.528
I forgot to ask you.

02:38.530 --> 02:41.315
All of you, actually.

02:41.317 --> 02:44.117
You want to earn
some deep appreciation

02:44.119 --> 02:45.969
and make a little money
on the side?

02:45.971 --> 02:47.904
You lost me at
appreciation.

02:47.906 --> 02:50.540
The hockey team is having
their awards dinner

02:50.542 --> 02:53.043
at the boathouse tomorrow,
and I need extra servers.

02:53.045 --> 02:54.578
What do you think?

02:54.580 --> 02:57.214
I'd love to, but I'm a little
waitressed out.

02:57.216 --> 02:58.832
Thanks, though.

03:01.469 --> 03:03.387
Come on.

03:03.389 --> 03:05.005
What about you guys?

03:05.007 --> 03:06.473
Seriously.
My dad can't be there,

03:06.475 --> 03:07.674
and I need
some extra hands.

03:07.676 --> 03:09.726
- Is he ok?
- My dad?

03:09.728 --> 03:12.879
Oh, I think so.

03:12.881 --> 03:15.349
I don't know.
He's just been...

03:15.351 --> 03:18.318
kind of freaked out since
Cassie's dad showed up.

03:18.320 --> 03:20.020
Yeah,
he's actually a mess.

03:20.022 --> 03:22.939
And I lost a girlfriend,
Jake almost died,

03:22.941 --> 03:25.575
and the witch hunters are more
excited about killing us than ever.

03:25.577 --> 03:29.079
So it's real fun having
Blackwell back from the dead.

03:29.081 --> 03:32.565
I'll do it. Boys hockey team?
That might be fun.

03:32.567 --> 03:34.000
I'm not into
slave labor.

03:34.002 --> 03:35.786
It's $10 an hour

03:35.788 --> 03:37.587
plus a basket
of chicken wings.

03:37.589 --> 03:39.256
Eww. 15.

03:39.258 --> 03:41.875
Done. Thank you.

03:41.877 --> 03:43.877
I appreciate it.

03:45.880 --> 03:48.765
That poor guy.
Cassie can't even be around him.

03:48.767 --> 03:50.384
It's tragic.

03:50.386 --> 03:52.085
Tragic is not
asking for 20.

03:54.000 --> 04:00.074

04:02.096 --> 04:04.197
There he is!

04:04.199 --> 04:06.266
This way!

04:09.103 --> 04:12.072
Hurry up!
Get him!

04:18.762 --> 04:21.298
Enough.

04:22.750 --> 04:24.584
Let him go.

04:26.888 --> 04:29.723
He's heading into
Chance Harbor.

04:29.725 --> 04:31.394
We're just going to
have to work faster.

Original Air Date on March 29, 2012

04:56.317 --> 04:58.752
Hi. Uh, just--

05:01.924 --> 05:03.507
Yeah. Yeah.

05:05.092 --> 05:07.961
Uh, what--what--
what can I get you?

05:07.963 --> 05:10.931
Um...

05:10.933 --> 05:12.098
Coffee?

05:12.100 --> 05:14.468
Excellent choice.

05:14.470 --> 05:15.835
You checking up on me?

05:15.837 --> 05:17.854
Making sure
I haven't fallen apart?

05:17.856 --> 05:19.773
Pretty much.

05:22.693 --> 05:25.178
Did you tell Adam
the elixir didn't work on you?

05:25.180 --> 05:27.314
No.

05:27.316 --> 05:29.149
He'd feel terrible
if he knew.

05:29.151 --> 05:30.700
I haven't told anyone.

05:31.903 --> 05:33.153
Do you want to
talk about it?

05:33.155 --> 05:35.956
No. Thanks, though.

05:39.527 --> 05:42.295
You want to, uh...

05:42.297 --> 05:44.214
Go mini-golfing
sometime?

05:44.216 --> 05:45.665
Excuse me?

05:45.667 --> 05:47.634
There's a--
there's a course--

05:47.636 --> 05:50.554
it's mini-course
by my house I just rented.

05:50.556 --> 05:53.173
And I was--
it looks like fun. I--

05:54.709 --> 05:56.059
Never mind.
It's a stupid idea.

05:57.711 --> 06:00.480
I was just trying
to think of things

06:00.482 --> 06:02.048
that people did when I
was here last, you know.

06:02.050 --> 06:03.683
Father-daughter
things?

06:03.685 --> 06:06.353
Yeah. Yeah.

06:06.355 --> 06:10.056
Mini-golf sounds nice.
We should try it sometime.

06:10.058 --> 06:12.392
Great.

06:12.394 --> 06:14.327
Refill, please.

06:14.329 --> 06:17.163
Oh, uh, yeah.
Excuse me.

06:18.082 --> 06:20.083
Hi. Refill?

06:34.966 --> 06:37.267
Oh. I'm coming through.
Careful.

06:37.269 --> 06:39.352
Whoa.

06:42.106 --> 06:43.256
For you.

06:43.258 --> 06:45.442
- What is that?
- It's ginger ale.

06:45.444 --> 06:48.228
Compliments of some guy I've
never seen before

06:48.230 --> 06:51.231
who insisted that
if it couldn't be champagne,

06:51.233 --> 06:55.569
it at least needed to be served
in this glass.

06:55.571 --> 06:57.871
Flute, actually.

06:57.873 --> 06:59.205
Who is he?

06:59.207 --> 07:00.773
Grant.

07:00.775 --> 07:01.992
And?

07:01.994 --> 07:03.776
And I think
I should thank him.

07:07.582 --> 07:08.882
You came back.

07:08.884 --> 07:10.166
Told you I would.

07:10.168 --> 07:11.501
Thank you
for the bubbly.

07:11.503 --> 07:12.886
Yeah. The waiter
really wouldn't let me

07:12.888 --> 07:13.953
buy you the real stuff.

07:13.955 --> 07:15.755
Uh, yeah,
the waiter.

07:15.757 --> 07:18.425
He's stubborn
like that.

07:18.427 --> 07:22.262
Would you like to spend
the afternoon with me?

07:22.264 --> 07:24.764
I'm dying to hear how you've passed
the time since I've been gone.

07:24.766 --> 07:27.484
That sounds great.

07:27.486 --> 07:30.403
You know what?
Let me check something really quick.

07:33.107 --> 07:34.908
Hey, I know I said
I'd help tonight,

07:34.910 --> 07:36.918
but would you be
really mad at me if

07:36.943 --> 07:38.243
I bailed on the banquet?

07:38.330 --> 07:39.329
Why?

07:39.331 --> 07:41.781
Because I have a date.

07:41.783 --> 07:43.149
With that guy?

07:43.151 --> 07:45.785
Yes. Grant.

07:48.289 --> 07:49.873
You think that's smart?

07:49.875 --> 07:52.125
Dating some random guy
out of nowhere?

07:52.127 --> 07:55.128
I'll be fine.

07:55.130 --> 07:56.680
Thanks, dad.

07:56.682 --> 07:58.632
Let's go.

08:00.051 --> 08:02.769
She gets to leave?
Not fair.

08:02.771 --> 08:05.772
More chicken wings
for you.

08:27.294 --> 08:29.195
Jake. Jake!

08:29.197 --> 08:30.714
You aren't listening!

08:41.475 --> 08:43.677
Jake, listen!

08:56.741 --> 08:58.908
He's a friend.

09:09.008 --> 09:13.177
No, no, no.
Wait. Wait. Wait. Oh.

09:13.179 --> 09:14.379
So, what,
he's a witch hunter?

09:14.381 --> 09:16.431
Samuel. I've known him
for a while.

09:16.433 --> 09:17.799
Ah. Jeez.

09:17.801 --> 09:20.418
So now witch hunters
are hunting you?

09:20.420 --> 09:21.803
How does that feel?

09:21.805 --> 09:23.805
I didn't come
to kill you.

09:23.807 --> 09:25.223
You snuck
into my room.

09:25.225 --> 09:28.610
You jumped me
before I could explain.

09:28.612 --> 09:29.944
I need your help.

09:29.946 --> 09:31.429
Help you?

09:31.431 --> 09:33.531
I need to speak with
John Blackwell.

09:33.533 --> 09:36.234
What do you want
with him?

09:36.236 --> 09:40.605
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

09:40.607 --> 09:42.040
But he will.

09:42.042 --> 09:44.775
No. No. He's using us
to set up my father,

09:44.777 --> 09:45.910
just like Eben tried to.

09:45.912 --> 09:47.211
Jake knows better.

09:47.213 --> 09:50.415
We were once friends.
We served together.

09:50.417 --> 09:52.417
Served? Really?
That's what you call it?

09:53.503 --> 09:55.003
You shouldn't
have come here.

09:55.005 --> 09:57.622
I had no choice.

09:57.624 --> 10:00.224
I'm running from Eben.
He'll kill me

10:00.226 --> 10:02.226
to keep me from telling
Blackwell what I know.

10:02.228 --> 10:04.312
What? You got
something to say, say it.

10:08.684 --> 10:10.818
He's resurrecting
demons.

10:28.253 --> 10:31.956
Yo! Not only did
we win our league...

10:33.660 --> 10:35.793
But--but we have

10:35.795 --> 10:40.131
two of the most beautiful girls
in our school waiting on us.

10:40.133 --> 10:42.767
Awesome!

10:52.511 --> 10:54.312
You know, I think Diana's
got the right idea,

10:54.314 --> 10:56.698
dating outside
the witchy world.

10:56.700 --> 10:59.734
It would be nice to have
a regular romance problems,

10:59.736 --> 11:02.320
not the epic,
tragic kind.

11:02.322 --> 11:04.739
And Kyle is
pretty cute.

11:04.741 --> 11:07.742
You know, in a simple,
magic-free guy way.

11:07.744 --> 11:09.761
He's exactly
what I could use.

11:09.763 --> 11:11.963
And exactly
what I could use.

11:20.305 --> 11:22.807
Do want to have some fun?
I know you could use it.

11:22.809 --> 11:26.060
That's true. What?

11:26.062 --> 11:29.313
How'd you like to help me
steal Kyle's attention?

11:29.315 --> 11:31.015
From what?
His trophy?

11:31.017 --> 11:34.986
No, from Faye. She's already
doing her patented lean-in.

11:34.988 --> 11:36.854
Look, see what I mean?

11:36.856 --> 11:39.023
How would this
be fun for me?

11:39.025 --> 11:40.942
Well, because it would
be a distraction.

11:40.944 --> 11:44.729
And wouldn't it be fun to see
the look of shock on her face?

11:45.564 --> 11:46.698
All right.

11:46.700 --> 11:49.000
You go and start
talking to him.

11:49.002 --> 11:51.502
Think hockey.
You'll see.

12:00.412 --> 12:02.413
Excuse you.

12:02.415 --> 12:03.381
Hey, Kyle.

12:03.383 --> 12:05.366
Melissa.
How's it going?

12:05.368 --> 12:07.402
Good. Really good.

12:07.404 --> 12:08.853
I was just wondering
if you caught

12:08.855 --> 12:10.221
the Canucks game
last night.

12:10.223 --> 12:13.758
Uh, yes, I did. Why?

12:13.760 --> 12:15.977
It's kind of crazy.
When I watched Kedler,

12:15.979 --> 12:18.396
it totally reminded me
of your game.

12:18.398 --> 12:21.449
And he caught the breakaway
and deked the defenseman?

12:21.451 --> 12:24.435
It was like your move
in the third period of

12:24.460 --> 12:27.592
the conference finals
when you tried that

12:27.593 --> 12:30.530
slapshot and scored
from the blue line.

12:33.045 --> 12:34.612
Yeah.

12:35.881 --> 12:37.448
That was--

12:37.450 --> 12:39.250
that was
a nice shot.

12:39.252 --> 12:40.551
It was
a good goal.

12:53.099 --> 12:55.099
What better way to
top off a perfect day

12:55.101 --> 12:57.435
than with
some ice dancing?

12:58.605 --> 13:00.238
Or wobbling,
in my case.

13:00.240 --> 13:02.640
So how'd you learn
how to Jimmy a lock like that?

13:02.642 --> 13:05.109
That's standard knowledge
for Australian boys.

13:05.111 --> 13:08.412
While little Diana
was off braiding hair

13:08.414 --> 13:10.364
and making
friendship bracelets,

13:10.366 --> 13:14.452
little Grant was learning to
pick locks and fire potato guns.

13:14.454 --> 13:16.454
What's
a potato gun?

13:16.456 --> 13:18.089
I'm saving that
for date number two.

13:18.091 --> 13:20.374
And somewhere along
the way, you learned to sail.

13:20.376 --> 13:22.376
Yeah.
My dad taught me.

13:22.378 --> 13:24.212
Well, I can't believe your dad
just gave you a yacht.

13:24.214 --> 13:26.430
My dad barely lets me
borrow the car.

13:28.467 --> 13:31.185
Me and dad don't
get along so well.

13:31.187 --> 13:34.222
We're better suited
with an ocean between us.

13:34.224 --> 13:36.641
It must be incredible to
be able to just pick up

13:36.643 --> 13:39.060
and sail off
whenever you want.

13:39.062 --> 13:41.145
You can, too,
you know.

13:43.596 --> 13:46.598
Come with me.

13:46.600 --> 13:48.283
Anywhere you want.

13:48.285 --> 13:50.235
Second date.

13:50.237 --> 13:52.070
Say the word.

13:53.105 --> 13:55.273
You're all about
adventure, are you?

13:55.275 --> 13:57.376
Act now,
think later?

13:57.378 --> 14:01.797
No, I've been thinking
about this for a while.

14:15.095 --> 14:17.295
We'll pretend
that didn't happen.

14:17.297 --> 14:18.630
Yeah. Please?

14:20.683 --> 14:22.401
Hot chocolate
back at my boat?

14:22.403 --> 14:24.353
Didn't I say no boat
until the second date?

14:24.355 --> 14:26.609
If only little Grant had
learned about patience

14:26.634 --> 14:28.806
instead of tomato guns.

14:29.476 --> 14:32.644
Potato.

14:32.646 --> 14:35.364
Your point is well made.

14:35.366 --> 14:38.417
Lucky for you,
I'm a fast learner.

14:38.419 --> 14:40.285
Too bad you're
a slow skater.

14:41.821 --> 14:44.423
Ahh!
Yeah!

14:50.096 --> 14:52.264
Where's
the witch hunter?

14:52.266 --> 14:53.665
In the kitchen,
tied up.

14:53.667 --> 14:55.100
How did he find me?

14:55.102 --> 14:58.904
Jake.
They served together.

14:58.906 --> 15:01.506
She's right. I know him. And I
don't think he'd come here on a lie.

15:01.508 --> 15:03.976
I'm going
to find out.

15:03.978 --> 15:05.694
Stay here.

15:19.459 --> 15:22.694
Using your history with
Jake to draw me in, huh?

15:25.131 --> 15:26.531
Is that your ploy?

15:29.869 --> 15:32.087
Either Eben is grooming
an army of idiots,

15:32.089 --> 15:35.257
or you're telling
the truth about demons.

15:35.259 --> 15:38.143
And honestly,
I'd prefer the former.

15:38.145 --> 15:41.730
It's true, I swear.
He wants demons.

15:41.732 --> 15:42.731
Why?

15:42.733 --> 15:44.983
To use their power.

15:44.985 --> 15:46.351
So that he can
finally destroy you

15:46.353 --> 15:48.386
and all the other witches
once and for all.

15:50.057 --> 15:51.857
You're lying.

15:51.859 --> 15:54.893
Eben can't use demons.
He's human.

15:54.895 --> 15:57.529
He's working
with a witch.

16:00.334 --> 16:02.567
You already knew that.

16:02.569 --> 16:04.002
You're just testing me.

16:04.004 --> 16:05.537
Who's the witch?

16:05.539 --> 16:06.955
I don't know.

16:06.957 --> 16:08.373
I'll know
if you're lying.

16:08.375 --> 16:10.125
Look, no one does.

16:10.127 --> 16:12.511
Eben's keeping
everything a secret.

16:12.513 --> 16:14.913
He's gotten all paranoid
and crazy, ok?

16:14.915 --> 16:17.632
He's obsessed with magic
and now demons.

16:17.634 --> 16:21.803
He's become worse than
what we're trying to stop.

16:21.805 --> 16:25.390
Eben is going to summon
the demons at Harbor Woods...

16:27.560 --> 16:29.761
Just like you did
16 years ago.

16:31.147 --> 16:33.565
We know that you tried
to give the demons bodies

16:33.567 --> 16:36.284
so that they could
walk among us,

16:36.286 --> 16:37.903
the bodies of witches
so that they would be stronger.

16:37.905 --> 16:40.122
Hell, you were going
to use their power

16:40.124 --> 16:41.573
against your enemies.

16:41.575 --> 16:44.709
And in order
to summon them,

16:44.711 --> 16:46.878
you sacrificed a mortal

16:46.880 --> 16:48.630
and buried them
at the site of the ceremony.

16:48.632 --> 16:49.714
Honestly!

16:49.716 --> 16:52.300
He was going
to sacrifice me, ok?

16:52.302 --> 16:54.920
That's why I escaped.

16:54.922 --> 16:57.222
That's why I'm here.

16:58.257 --> 16:59.758
If you don't stop him,

16:59.760 --> 17:02.761
Eben is going to get the
demon power that you wanted.

17:14.569 --> 17:16.986
Oh, so close!

17:18.271 --> 17:20.656
No.
Don't play innocent.

17:20.657 --> 17:22.001
I know you did not help

17:22.026 --> 17:24.739
Melissa magicflirt with
Kyle instead of me.

17:25.195 --> 17:27.964
I am just trying to get some
work done here, Faye.

17:27.965 --> 17:29.481
And how are you going
to get work done

17:29.483 --> 17:30.917
when I walk out of here
in protest?

17:30.919 --> 17:32.484
I don't negotiate
with terrorists.

17:32.486 --> 17:34.120
You're helping me.

17:34.122 --> 17:36.539
I want to slapshot that smile
right off Melissa's face.

17:38.960 --> 17:40.426
I don't know how
I could help you, Faye.

17:40.428 --> 17:42.494
You're all stocked up
in the charm department.

17:48.685 --> 17:50.136
Fine.

17:50.138 --> 17:53.839
Watch.
You'll figure it out.

17:57.444 --> 17:59.028
Need some pointers?

17:59.030 --> 18:03.900
Of course, yeah. I'm not
very good at this game, so.

18:03.902 --> 18:06.369
- Follow my lead.
- Ok.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.129
Aw, come on!

18:17.131 --> 18:20.132
Did you guys--
did you guys just see that?

18:25.672 --> 18:27.306
I can't believe I did that!

18:27.308 --> 18:29.041
Whoa! Nice!

18:29.043 --> 18:30.676
How did you
do that?

18:33.614 --> 18:37.016
Is it true?
You summoned demons

18:37.018 --> 18:39.135
and murdered
an innocent to do it?

18:39.137 --> 18:41.487
Yes, I summoned demons.

18:41.489 --> 18:43.272
But there was
no sacrifice.

18:43.274 --> 18:46.725
My Balcoin blood was
all I needed.

18:46.727 --> 18:48.227
How comforting.

18:48.229 --> 18:51.998
I was trying to
protect the circle.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.617
I thought I could use demons
to fight off the witch hunters.

18:54.619 --> 18:58.571
But the demons wanted
to possess the circle.

18:58.573 --> 19:01.073
It was your mother.

19:01.075 --> 19:03.726
Your mother
stopped them.

19:03.728 --> 19:05.744
She spelled the demons
and trapped them

19:05.746 --> 19:07.380
before they took over
the circle.

19:07.382 --> 19:08.848
That didn't help
Heather Barnes.

19:08.850 --> 19:13.185
I saw what the demons did
to her, because of you.

19:13.187 --> 19:16.889
Every death that day
was a tragedy.

19:18.058 --> 19:20.893
Can Eben do what
Samuel says he can?

19:20.895 --> 19:24.563
If he has a witch--
a traitor--yes.

19:24.565 --> 19:26.115
Is there a way
to stop him?

19:28.535 --> 19:30.586
Got to seal the ground where
the demons come up.

19:30.588 --> 19:33.439
Then that's what
we need to do.

19:33.441 --> 19:34.824
Fine.

19:34.826 --> 19:36.959
How? You don't
have magic anymore.

19:38.378 --> 19:41.780
Gather the circle,
all right? Every member.

19:41.782 --> 19:44.050
I'll wait for you
at the abandoned house.

19:44.052 --> 19:45.918
There's tools there I need.

19:59.266 --> 20:01.133
Hey. Have you seen Kyle?

20:01.135 --> 20:02.151
Kyle.
Right there.

20:04.605 --> 20:07.440
Beat 'em again, bro.
Beat 'em again.

20:07.442 --> 20:09.825
Hi. I missed you.

20:09.827 --> 20:12.495
I missed you, too.

20:15.248 --> 20:17.917
What the hell?

20:17.919 --> 20:19.785
You've been flirting
with my friends all night,

20:19.787 --> 20:21.287
and now, you have
a girlfriend?

20:21.289 --> 20:22.872
Uh, no.

20:22.874 --> 20:24.340
I was not flirting
with your friends, ok?

20:24.342 --> 20:25.791
They were flirting
with me.

20:25.793 --> 20:27.460
Oh, please.

20:27.462 --> 20:28.660
Listen to for a second.

20:28.662 --> 20:30.496
My girlfriend is
standing right there.

20:30.498 --> 20:31.597
You have some respect.

20:31.599 --> 20:32.998
- Me?
- Yeah.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.266
You're the one
who has no respect.

20:34.268 --> 20:36.102
You've been acting
all night like

20:36.104 --> 20:38.187
she didn't even exist.
Like you didn't have her.

20:38.189 --> 20:41.190
Do you have any idea how lucky
you are to have what you have?

20:41.192 --> 20:43.976
Ok. Ok. I think you're taking
this a little personal, Conant.

20:43.978 --> 20:45.694
You have a thing for one
of those girls over there,

20:45.696 --> 20:47.646
and you can't get what you want?
Is that what this is?

20:47.648 --> 20:49.148
Don't you touch me.

20:49.150 --> 20:51.317
Hey, hey!

20:51.319 --> 20:53.903
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

20:53.905 --> 20:56.155
Stop it.
Stop it. Stop it!

20:56.157 --> 20:58.874
Leave it!

21:03.296 --> 21:05.998
You hit a hockey player
for no reason.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.416
That's not normal
Adam behavior.

21:07.418 --> 21:09.301
Seriously, what the hell is
going on with you?

21:09.303 --> 21:11.587
I'm on edge!
That's all.

21:11.589 --> 21:14.890
We get it. Losing someone
you care about.

21:14.892 --> 21:17.510
We do.

21:17.512 --> 21:21.147
And it sucks
big time.

21:23.517 --> 21:27.269
The thing is, I...

21:27.271 --> 21:30.722
for the blink of an eye,
I feel like...

21:30.724 --> 21:32.992
everything was perfect.

21:34.111 --> 21:36.679
But I can't remember
that feeling.

21:38.731 --> 21:41.333
And I keep trying...

21:41.335 --> 21:43.068
but I can't.

21:43.070 --> 21:45.371
I know this is going
to sound crazy,

21:45.373 --> 21:48.290
but in some ways,
you're lucky.

21:48.292 --> 21:52.294
If you remembered it,
you'd miss it.

21:52.296 --> 21:55.914
And missing it is
the worst part.

22:05.526 --> 22:08.110
Speak of
the devil-girl.

22:09.530 --> 22:12.064
Adam, is everyone
still with you?

22:12.066 --> 22:13.482
Faye and Melissa are.

22:13.484 --> 22:15.484
Ok. I need you to get
to the abandoned house

22:15.486 --> 22:16.902
as soon as you can.

22:16.904 --> 22:18.404
I'll explain
when you get there.

22:18.406 --> 22:20.156
Ok.

22:20.158 --> 22:21.490
Oh, and do you know
where Diana went?

22:21.492 --> 22:23.108
I tried calling her
first, but no answer.

22:23.110 --> 22:24.710
I don't know.
She was on a date

22:24.712 --> 22:26.245
with
some Australian guy.

22:26.247 --> 22:28.964
Ok, all right. Thanks.

22:28.966 --> 22:30.749
I have to find Diana.

22:30.751 --> 22:32.885
I'll gather the circle,
and I'll meet you at the house.

22:41.978 --> 22:44.096
Hey!

22:44.098 --> 22:45.631
I've been looking
for you.

22:45.633 --> 22:48.017
What are you...

22:48.019 --> 22:49.485
I thought you didn't want
to come down tonight?

22:49.487 --> 22:51.103
I changed my mind.

22:51.105 --> 22:53.939
Ah. Well,
I'm so glad.

22:55.609 --> 22:57.109
Hi, I'm Diana.

22:57.111 --> 23:00.112
I'm Pete.
Ship's captain.

23:00.114 --> 23:03.916
Captain? You have
your own captain? Impressive.

23:03.918 --> 23:05.417
How big is
your boat?

23:05.419 --> 23:07.770
Your boat?

23:07.772 --> 23:09.488
Come on.

23:09.490 --> 23:12.091
But your boat's
that way.

23:12.093 --> 23:14.944
Oh, unless you're taking her
to see your private jet?

23:14.946 --> 23:16.795
Right. I get it. That's where
your chef is, whipping up

23:16.797 --> 23:18.597
another 5-star meal for your
flights to downtown Chance Harbor.

23:18.599 --> 23:20.216
That's kind of weird
for your Captain

23:20.218 --> 23:22.184
to be talking
to you like that.

23:29.559 --> 23:32.978
I haven't been
completely honest with you.

23:34.231 --> 23:36.232
I might have exaggerated
my position

23:36.234 --> 23:38.384
in regards
to the boat.

23:41.621 --> 23:45.324
It's not mine.
I'm just one of the crew.

23:47.043 --> 23:49.161
That's not an exaggeration.
That's a lie.

23:49.163 --> 23:50.329
Wait, Diana.

23:50.331 --> 23:52.498
Stay the hell away
from me.

23:58.838 --> 24:01.390
So, where's this house
we're meeting them at?

24:01.392 --> 24:02.925
It's a hell of a walk.

24:02.927 --> 24:04.793
We're not going
to the house.

24:04.795 --> 24:07.646
What? Hey, aren't we meeting up
with your daughter and her circle?

24:07.648 --> 24:09.848
No. This is
too dangerous for them.

24:09.850 --> 24:11.317
But you don't have
any power.

24:11.319 --> 24:12.935
We need the circle,
right?

24:12.937 --> 24:15.387
We need to stop Eben
before he hurts the circle.

24:15.389 --> 24:18.107
Now, come on.

24:18.109 --> 24:20.993
Let's go.

24:51.290 --> 24:52.839
Hey.

24:52.841 --> 24:55.875
Hey. Why haven't you
been answering your phone?

24:55.877 --> 24:57.961
Because
I don't want to.

24:57.963 --> 25:00.213
I've been looking for you
everywhere. This is important.

25:00.215 --> 25:03.600
Of course it is.
It always is.

25:03.602 --> 25:06.386
You know, Faye's right.
You really are a drama queen.

25:06.388 --> 25:09.005
This is not about me.
This is about us.

25:09.007 --> 25:11.224
Can't I have
5 minutes to myself?

25:11.226 --> 25:14.894
I mean, obviously, there's
no way to have an actual life,

25:14.896 --> 25:16.446
but 5 minutes
for a coffee?

25:16.448 --> 25:19.032
I mean, it's even
in a to-go cup,

25:19.034 --> 25:21.151
just in case.
The circle's in trouble.

25:22.236 --> 25:26.122
What is going on?
Really?

25:26.124 --> 25:28.992
It doesn't matter.

25:28.994 --> 25:31.861
All that's important is
what's going on with you.

25:33.297 --> 25:35.815
Ok. Ok.

25:35.817 --> 25:39.085
Demons. The witch hunters are
about to get some,

25:39.087 --> 25:42.072
and my father is going
to help us stop them.

25:51.599 --> 25:55.068
When you say Cassie's dad
brought demons to Chance Harbor,

25:55.070 --> 25:57.220
you mean our demons

25:57.222 --> 25:59.522
from the creepy,
buried suitcase?

25:59.524 --> 26:01.825
So we really have to
deal with this again?

26:01.827 --> 26:03.410
It's another fun
Blackwell story.

26:03.412 --> 26:05.278
It was a long time ago.
He's just trying

26:05.280 --> 26:06.529
to make up
for his mistakes.

26:06.531 --> 26:08.415
His mistakes killed
your brother.

26:11.702 --> 26:13.036
- Finally.
- Hey.

26:13.038 --> 26:15.038
- Where's my father?
- Not here yet.

26:15.040 --> 26:18.041
But he was
coming here first.

26:18.043 --> 26:20.076
He was supposed to be
waiting for all of us.

26:20.078 --> 26:23.179
Did we get stood up
by your dad?

26:25.316 --> 26:27.300
He didn't want us
to go.

26:27.302 --> 26:29.135
He was trying
to protect us.

26:29.137 --> 26:30.937
He's going to deal with
the demons by himself?

26:30.939 --> 26:32.555
I thought he doesn't have
magic anymore.

26:32.557 --> 26:35.525
He doesn't.
He'll never walk away from this.

26:47.955 --> 26:49.572
Is this the place?

26:51.959 --> 26:55.412
This is where you called up
demons 16 years ago?

26:56.613 --> 26:58.214
Yeah.

26:59.950 --> 27:01.551
They came up
through there.

27:03.787 --> 27:05.755
Hey. Hey.

27:07.057 --> 27:09.392
I've got to do this
before Eben gets here.

27:16.133 --> 27:18.601
Do you want me
to do something?

27:18.603 --> 27:22.805
Just don't move.

27:28.028 --> 27:29.579
What are you--
what are you doing?

27:29.581 --> 27:31.114
The demons are strong,

27:31.116 --> 27:34.284
but they can't cross
over these symbols.

27:34.286 --> 27:37.287
Really? So drawing
some lines in the dirt,

27:37.289 --> 27:40.423
that's--that's supposed
to keep us safe?

27:42.843 --> 27:46.129
Not us.

27:46.131 --> 27:47.464
Me.

27:47.466 --> 27:48.664
What the hell are you
talking about?

27:48.666 --> 27:50.333
Whoa! Oh!

27:51.836 --> 27:54.304
What are you doing?

27:54.306 --> 27:56.606
Why can't I cross
the circle?

27:58.609 --> 28:00.977
Because there's
a demon inside you.

28:00.979 --> 28:02.845
You've already
been sacrificed.

28:09.299 --> 28:11.067
Well,
get it out of me!

28:11.069 --> 28:12.702
I didn't know!
I swear!

28:12.704 --> 28:15.822
When Eben gave your body
to the demons, he sacrificed you.

28:17.191 --> 28:20.159
Now he can summon
the rest of the demons.

28:20.161 --> 28:23.746
But this circle will draw
the demon out of you

28:23.748 --> 28:26.082
and send it back
to the abyss.

28:26.084 --> 28:28.868
And prevent Eben from
completing his ritual.

28:28.870 --> 28:30.536
Why would you
do that, John?

28:33.140 --> 28:36.392
You're the one that brought
the demons here to begin with.

28:36.394 --> 28:39.428
That was a mistake.

28:39.430 --> 28:41.314
So was coming here
without magic.

28:41.316 --> 28:45.134
Because of one of your witches,
I have power, and you don't.

28:45.136 --> 28:47.069
You should've gone back
into hiding, John.

28:49.691 --> 28:51.824
Once I control
the demons,

28:51.826 --> 28:55.862
I'll use them to slaughter
every witch alive.

28:55.864 --> 28:57.730
But you...

28:57.732 --> 29:00.082
I'll kill right now.

29:19.920 --> 29:22.388
Agite tenebrae abyssi.

29:22.390 --> 29:24.440
Agite tenebrae abyssi.

29:32.649 --> 29:36.002
Agite tenebrae abyssi.

29:36.004 --> 29:38.871
Samuel.
Samuel.

29:38.873 --> 29:40.907
You ok?
What's going on?

29:47.582 --> 29:48.831
He's got
a demon in him.

29:48.833 --> 29:49.832
Don't get
too close!

29:49.834 --> 29:51.584
We can stop him
together.

29:51.586 --> 29:54.220
Focus on stopping his movements.
Keep him where he is.

30:03.680 --> 30:06.349
Why isn't it working?
We're not stopping him.

30:06.351 --> 30:08.184
Circle magic didn't stop
the demon in Melissa, either.

30:08.186 --> 30:10.069
That was Cassie's
grandmother and her crystal.

30:10.071 --> 30:12.104
All right.
Everyone, stay back.

30:12.106 --> 30:13.489
Let me try.

30:32.759 --> 30:34.827
Agite tenebrae abyssi.
Agite tenebrae abyssi.

30:34.829 --> 30:38.097
- He's still coming.
- Cassie!

30:40.717 --> 30:42.802
Cassie!

30:45.306 --> 30:46.939
We'll all burn
together.

30:51.613 --> 30:54.146
Samuel!

30:54.148 --> 30:56.282
Stop.

31:00.787 --> 31:05.024
Take me.
I'm the one you want.

31:05.026 --> 31:08.411
I want power, and...

31:08.413 --> 31:11.213
You have nothing
to offer me anymore.

31:59.212 --> 32:01.246
We have to stop him.

32:01.248 --> 32:03.248
No! Stop! Stop!

32:03.250 --> 32:06.852
Stop! No!

32:06.854 --> 32:11.057
Let him go.
Let him go.

32:11.059 --> 32:13.759
He took the demons
inside of him.

32:13.761 --> 32:15.094
He's too strong.

32:15.096 --> 32:17.480
And you have magic.

32:17.482 --> 32:19.398
You've had it
the whole time.

32:22.035 --> 32:23.703
Yes.

32:23.705 --> 32:25.771
Why did you lie
to me?

32:29.409 --> 32:32.628
How could I convince you
to stop using your magic

32:32.630 --> 32:34.613
if I was using mine?

32:34.615 --> 32:37.616
I was just trying
to protect you

32:37.618 --> 32:39.785
from the dangers
of dark magic.

32:39.787 --> 32:42.121
Your magic is
what saved me.

32:42.123 --> 32:44.473
Us.

32:48.011 --> 32:50.863
It wasn't enough
to stop Eben.

32:50.865 --> 32:54.233
Now that he's got
what he was after...

32:54.235 --> 32:57.469
He's more powerful
than all of us.

33:28.634 --> 33:31.803
It's hard to lose
a battle.

33:31.805 --> 33:33.855
But what's important is
that you're still alive.

33:33.857 --> 33:35.673
Everyone except
for Samuel.

33:35.675 --> 33:37.192
He was a demon, Jake.

33:37.194 --> 33:39.377
They're even willing
to sacrifice

33:39.379 --> 33:43.114
their own people now
to destroy us.

33:43.116 --> 33:45.533
This war has to end.

33:45.535 --> 33:48.703
It's been going on
for far too long.

33:48.705 --> 33:52.323
Hundreds of thousands of witches
killed since the 14th century,

33:52.325 --> 33:55.076
and we have just stayed
in the shadows,

33:55.078 --> 33:56.828
hiding who we are,

33:56.830 --> 34:00.048
hoping that, you know,
something would change,

34:00.050 --> 34:03.051
that the goodness
in people would prevail.

34:03.053 --> 34:07.138
Nothing changed. They just found
new reasons to hate us,

34:07.140 --> 34:10.391
new ways to kill us.
And now,

34:10.393 --> 34:12.594
now, they've got demons.

34:13.963 --> 34:16.898
This war has to end now.

34:16.900 --> 34:20.134
We can't just sit back
and be victims anymore.

34:20.136 --> 34:21.920
We've got to rise up.

34:21.922 --> 34:24.539
I just spent
the last 16 years

34:24.541 --> 34:26.925
trying to believe that witchcraft
wasn't the answer.

34:28.561 --> 34:31.145
But I was wrong.

34:31.147 --> 34:33.297
It's the only answer.

34:34.583 --> 34:36.251
You really think
we can beat them?

34:36.253 --> 34:38.386
Yes.

34:38.388 --> 34:40.938
Better than waiting around for
Eben to come back.

34:40.940 --> 34:42.907
We're not
strong enough,

34:42.909 --> 34:45.126
not if he has demons. You
just said so.

34:45.128 --> 34:47.762
No. Even a circle with
as much power as yours

34:47.764 --> 34:49.330
isn't enough
against Eben now.

34:49.331 --> 34:50.931
So what are
you saying?

34:50.934 --> 34:52.667
Crystals.

34:54.335 --> 34:57.138
Yes. Crystals.

34:57.139 --> 35:00.558
Each one of your families
has its own crystal.

35:00.560 --> 35:03.778
Separately, they wield
tremendous power.

35:03.780 --> 35:06.664
But bound together in
their original form,

35:06.666 --> 35:08.900
there is
no stronger magic.

35:08.902 --> 35:10.451
So they fit
together?

35:10.453 --> 35:14.022
It was just one crystal
for a very long time,

35:14.024 --> 35:16.291
brought over by the first
settlers of Salem.

35:16.293 --> 35:18.660
But the elders,
they feared its power,

35:18.662 --> 35:20.962
so they split
the one into 6.

35:20.964 --> 35:23.131
I have one.

35:24.066 --> 35:26.668
Good.

35:26.670 --> 35:29.137
Then all we need to
do is find 5 more.

35:29.139 --> 35:31.756
And they'll be enough to stop
Eben and the witch hunters?

35:31.758 --> 35:36.377
Your circle together with
the power of 6 crystals

35:36.379 --> 35:38.546
can destroy them
once and for all.

35:38.548 --> 35:42.016
And we can finally
stop hiding.

35:42.018 --> 35:44.469
Forever.

36:08.010 --> 36:09.577
I can explain.

36:09.579 --> 36:11.596
I get it.
You're a liar.

36:11.598 --> 36:12.913
It seems pretty simple.

36:12.915 --> 36:15.883
Yes. It's just...

36:15.885 --> 36:17.585
I wanted
to impress you.

36:19.421 --> 36:21.856
I know
how lame that sounds.

36:21.858 --> 36:24.425
I've never done anything
like that before.

36:25.861 --> 36:27.578
I've crewed that boat
for the last year,

36:27.580 --> 36:30.982
and never been
anything but proud...

36:30.984 --> 36:34.719
Until you turned around
and smiled that smile at me.

36:34.721 --> 36:37.271
I...I realized

36:37.273 --> 36:38.990
if I let you walk
out of my life,

36:38.992 --> 36:42.410
I'd be the biggest idiot
I know.

36:42.412 --> 36:46.447
I panicked,
and then, I lied.

36:46.449 --> 36:49.617
And now, I'm
an even bigger idiot.

36:49.619 --> 36:52.770
What else is a lie?

36:52.772 --> 36:55.590
Your name?
Your accent?

36:55.592 --> 36:58.226
Nothing. I swear.

36:58.228 --> 37:00.361
I don't get along
well with my dad,

37:00.363 --> 37:02.346
I learned to pick locks
as a kid,

37:02.348 --> 37:05.083
and I'm a lousy
ice skater.

37:08.470 --> 37:10.438
Grant, in my world,

37:10.440 --> 37:13.274
people who lie
about who they are...

37:13.276 --> 37:14.392
They're dangerous.

37:14.394 --> 37:16.811
Your world?
Are you a spy?

37:16.813 --> 37:20.448
Which I'm--I'm
totally cool with.

37:20.450 --> 37:23.418
No, I'm not a spy.

37:25.821 --> 37:28.423
I don't have room in
my life for liars.

37:28.425 --> 37:29.990
I'm done with it now.

37:30.876 --> 37:32.493
I tried it,
and I hated it.

37:32.495 --> 37:33.795
I'm retired now.

37:33.797 --> 37:35.680
I'm sorry.

37:35.682 --> 37:38.266
Please. Forgive me.

37:40.052 --> 37:42.019
Or don't.
Wait one more day.

37:42.021 --> 37:46.691
Let me have just one day to
show you that I'm for real.

37:46.693 --> 37:48.292
To prove to you

37:48.294 --> 37:52.146
just how important
your trust is to me.

37:53.816 --> 37:56.434
Then we can reevaluate.

37:57.703 --> 38:00.154
You got one day.

38:19.491 --> 38:21.576
I was wrong about
your father.

38:21.578 --> 38:24.879
Yeah.

38:26.682 --> 38:29.700
And I'm sorry. I know I've been
hard on him.

38:29.702 --> 38:32.520
Oh, I forgive you,
if that helps.

38:34.356 --> 38:35.573
Immensely.

38:37.010 --> 38:38.559
He saved us tonight.

38:38.561 --> 38:42.163
And what he said about
the circle is right.

38:42.165 --> 38:47.034
We can't just
sit and wait.

38:47.036 --> 38:48.719
We have to go
after what we want,

38:48.721 --> 38:50.688
we have to
make it happen.

38:50.690 --> 38:53.574
And we have history
on our side.

38:53.576 --> 38:56.210
Yeah. Oh, we do.

38:56.212 --> 38:59.013
I feel like
this is the purpose

38:59.015 --> 39:04.218
behind every bad or stupid
thing that's ever happened to us.

39:04.220 --> 39:08.689
We need to be focused on
our enemies right now.

39:08.691 --> 39:11.526
Nothing else matters.

39:15.397 --> 39:17.398
You're right.

39:22.304 --> 39:23.738
You ok?

39:23.740 --> 39:25.540
Yeah, of course.

39:27.609 --> 39:29.627
Thanks for the ride.

39:29.629 --> 39:30.945
Cassie.

39:30.947 --> 39:33.548
Uh-huh?

39:35.184 --> 39:39.120
I thought
you were amazing...

39:39.122 --> 39:42.957
Up against
the witch hunters tonight.

39:42.959 --> 39:45.126
Just amazing.

39:46.812 --> 39:49.296
Thanks.

39:51.817 --> 39:53.467
Good night, Adam.

39:53.469 --> 39:55.236
Good night.
