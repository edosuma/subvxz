00:41.800 --> 00:44.700
[indistinct radio chatter]

00:50.900 --> 00:54.200
- [man] I've never seen that.
- [woman chattering indistinctly]

00:54.300 --> 00:58.200
- [man] Saucers. . .
- [woman]...a dry lake bed.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.200
- [man] What's your status?
- [man 2] Are you getting that on radar?

01:09.300 --> 01:12.000
[man] The government won't
admit UFOs are real because...

01:12.000 --> 01:14.300
[woman] They're among us today.

01:18.800 --> 01:20.700
[indistinct chatter]

01:20.800 --> 01:24.500
[voices] Roswell, Gulf Breeze,
Area 51 , Phoenix.

01:24.600 --> 01:27.500
[man] Scientists believe UFOs
are visiting our planet.

01:29.400 --> 01:32.600
- [man] UFOs are real and they know it.
- [man] Something happened.

01:32.600 --> 01:36.500
- [woman] I know what I saw...
- [man] Of course UFOs exist.

01:39.200 --> 01:42.900
[indistinct radio chatter]

01:43.000 --> 01:47.500
We were facing an alien threat
from outside this world.

01:53.700 --> 01:57.500
If the United States Air Force
did recover alien bodies...

01:57.600 --> 01:59.900
[man] UFOs are as real as you and me.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.500
[man] Unless the military
proves me wrong,

02:02.600 --> 02:05.600
what I saw was an alien spacecraft.

02:12.900 --> 02:17.000
[chatter in foreign language]

02:17.100 --> 02:19.000
[woman] You felt a connection
to your heart.

02:19.100 --> 02:20.800
And you heard directions in your mind.

02:20.900 --> 02:24.000
[man] We saw the alien spacecraft. . .

02:25.500 --> 02:30.300
[chatter in foreign languages]

02:39.700 --> 02:42.400
[woman] One UFO sighting.

02:42.500 --> 02:44.900
[man] There's more than meets the eye.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.800
UFOs are manifesting themselves
to people.

02:49.900 --> 02:53.400
[man] What we're talking about
is the greatest cover-up

02:53.500 --> 02:56.100
in the history of mankind.

03:06.800 --> 03:10.000
[man] Object of unknown origin
is at 90-K and descending fast!

03:10.000 --> 03:11.500
Get me a visual track now!

03:11.500 --> 03:15.200
Zero match
with anything on our database.

03:15.300 --> 03:16.600
It's maneuvering.

03:19.100 --> 03:22.200
- We're registering impact!
- [explosion]

03:25.100 --> 03:27.600
Get me Henry Burke. Now.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.800
[indistinct voice on PA]

03:31.800 --> 03:35.600
Hey. Do you think this is it?
It's the real deal, right?

03:38.100 --> 03:39.500
You'll learn.

03:41.200 --> 03:44.900
[man on PA] This is not a drill.
Attention...

03:46.800 --> 03:50.400
Squad and equipment locked and loaded.
I re-routed local law and media.

03:50.500 --> 03:53.300
Impact was eight minutes ago.
How long until we land?

03:59.800 --> 04:03.100
[â™ª Miley Cyrus: Fly On The Wall]

04:19.100 --> 04:21.200
[song continues from car radio]

04:23.300 --> 04:25.300
[sighing heavily]

04:28.200 --> 04:30.200
[grunting]

04:34.200 --> 04:38.300
Imperial Droid,
drive your Geonosian starfighters

04:38.400 --> 04:42.500
- to Planet... Hollywood.
- [both laughing]

04:42.500 --> 04:48.300
Die! Die! Whoa! Hey!
Give me... No! Come on!

04:52.000 --> 04:55.400
[mechanical breathing]

05:14.500 --> 05:15.700
Awesome.

05:17.700 --> 05:19.100
[running footsteps]

05:19.200 --> 05:24.600
Extend the perimeter.
No one gets in. Nothing gets out.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.800
[honking]

05:26.800 --> 05:28.800
Planet Hollywood, please.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.800
They've got everything here.

05:36.900 --> 05:40.400
This place is truly
like being on another planet.

05:40.400 --> 05:43.600
With all this to see every night,
you must never get bored.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.400
- [whistling]
- Greetings...!

05:58.700 --> 06:03.200
- Welcome to the nutjob convention.
- [woman] I understand your reaction.

06:03.300 --> 06:06.200
- They aren't helping our cause.
- Our cause?

06:07.200 --> 06:11.200
Educating the public on the legitimate
possibility of life on other planets.

06:11.300 --> 06:12.500
As a matter of fact,

06:12.600 --> 06:15.300
I'm giving a lecture
on Astrophysical Anomaly Detection

06:15.400 --> 06:16.900
at the nutjob convention.

06:18.100 --> 06:20.800
Feel free to stop by.
Skeptics are always welcome.

06:20.900 --> 06:23.100
- Keep the change.
- Thanks.

06:28.200 --> 06:30.000
[man] Dr. Alex Friedman.

06:31.200 --> 06:34.700
- [man] Watch your backs, please.
- A classic.

06:34.700 --> 06:37.600
[distant sirens wail]

06:47.000 --> 06:50.200
[indistinct shouting in the next room]

06:51.500 --> 06:52.900
[groans]

06:57.700 --> 06:59.700
[grunting]

07:01.000 --> 07:03.600
- [banging on wall]
- [man] Hey, come on!

07:03.600 --> 07:07.700
Knock it off, will ya? I need to sleep!

07:07.800 --> 07:10.300
Yeah, me too. [grunts]

07:16.800 --> 07:21.200
[man on TV] Now, Channel 1 3 Action
News in high-definition continues.

07:21.300 --> 07:22.800
Casey Smith, with a news alert.

07:22.900 --> 07:25.500
- An accident near Searchlight.
- [woman] I'm Tricia Kean.

07:25.500 --> 07:28.000
We're gonna take you to our reporter,
live on the scene.

07:28.100 --> 07:31.600
Officials are calling it the
worst chlorine spill in state history.

07:31.700 --> 07:34.700
A five-mile security perimeter
has been established.

07:34.800 --> 07:37.300
Highway patrol officers
have been re-routing traffic

07:37.400 --> 07:40.000
since the early morning hours,
and we're now being told

07:40.100 --> 07:43.700
this section of Route 95
will be closed indefinitely.

07:43.800 --> 07:46.200
This is Natalie Gann reporting.

08:30.100 --> 08:32.400
[instruments buzzing]

08:39.799 --> 08:43.100
The casts we pulled out of the trench
indicate a distinct pattern

08:43.200 --> 08:47.700
alternating between the depth
of the impressions here and here.

08:47.800 --> 08:53.000
Suggesting not one, but two
separate EBEs. They were moving fast.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.500
Bipedal...

08:56.200 --> 08:58.000
...possibly humanoid in form.

09:01.300 --> 09:04.600
Review every data-gathering
entity within a 50-mile radius,

09:04.600 --> 09:09.000
starting upon impact.
Look out for any anomalies.

09:14.300 --> 09:16.900
You guys gotta move this thing.
I gotta go. Come on.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.700
Jack.

09:18.800 --> 09:21.600
You don't return phone calls anymore?

09:21.700 --> 09:23.600
Mr. Wolfe thinks you're being rude.

09:23.700 --> 09:26.800
Well, tell Wolfe that when I said
it was the last time, I meant it.

09:26.900 --> 09:30.600
Mr. Wolfe decides
when it's the last time. Not you, Jack.

09:30.700 --> 09:34.700
He likes you, Jackie. Hates to see you
wasting your God-given driving talent

09:34.800 --> 09:37.400
giving fat tourists cab rides
up and down the Strip.

09:37.500 --> 09:39.800
Buddy, what kind of life is that?

09:39.900 --> 09:41.100
It's one I'm late for.

09:44.300 --> 09:47.100
[grunting]

09:47.200 --> 09:50.100
- You got a death wish?
- I drive a cab in Vegas.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.200
- You're dead, Jack.
- [siren wails]

09:55.300 --> 09:59.400
Hey! What are you doing?
Man, are you insane?

09:59.500 --> 10:02.100
Move this out of the taxi zone
before I give you a ticket.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.000
[man] See you soon, Jackie.

10:19.800 --> 10:21.800
[tires screech]

10:23.600 --> 10:25.100
[horn honks]

10:25.100 --> 10:27.400
- Where'd you come from?
- Outside.

10:27.500 --> 10:30.800
I figured that part out on my own.
How'd you get in the car?

10:30.900 --> 10:33.200
- Through that portal.
- [honking]

10:33.300 --> 10:34.800
I'm Seth. This is my sister, Sara.

10:34.900 --> 10:37.200
We require transportation
services immediately.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.000
Really? Well, I require...

10:39.100 --> 10:42.300
- A currency transaction.
- Would this amount suffice?

10:42.400 --> 10:45.700
- What, did you two rob a bank?
- Is this acceptable, Jack Bruno?

10:45.700 --> 10:48.900
- How'd you know my name?
- [honking]

10:49.000 --> 10:52.200
If we have a deal for your services,
we must move forward rapidly.

10:52.300 --> 10:54.400
It's urgent we get
to our destination without delay.

10:54.500 --> 10:55.600
All right. I'm going.

10:56.800 --> 10:58.000
Where to?

11:00.400 --> 11:03.300
[beeping]

11:03.300 --> 11:06.500
- I need an address.
- We must travel in that direction.

11:06.600 --> 11:10.900
I'm gonna need something more specific
than just "that direction."

11:11.000 --> 11:15.700
We must locate latitude 40.54
cross-intersecting longitude...

11:15.800 --> 11:17.900
We're gonna stick with "that direction."

11:21.400 --> 11:25.200
We tracked the two sets of EBE
footprints on and off for 7.3 miles,

11:25.300 --> 11:27.300
losing them
at a rest stop off the highway.

11:27.400 --> 11:29.700
Four hours, 1 9 minutes
post-impact, there was

11:29.800 --> 11:33.400
a highway patrol incident report
filed at... the exact same rest stop.

11:33.500 --> 11:36.100
A car trunk was burglarized,
no signs of forced entry.

11:36.200 --> 11:38.300
Give me something
better than that, Mr. Pope!

11:38.400 --> 11:41.000
Stolen clothing
belonging to a couple of teenagers.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.800
We're in the game. Let's roll with this.

11:42.900 --> 11:45.400
Two kids don't
walk down the highway alone at night.

11:45.500 --> 11:48.600
We got a bus. Landing roughly
at the same time, same rest stop.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.200
Thirty-nine people exit.

11:50.300 --> 11:53.200
Fast-forward to the passengers
re-entering the vehicle.

11:53.300 --> 11:56.800
- Fast-forwarding.
- Stop. Rewind.

11:58.600 --> 12:00.000
Freeze.

12:00.800 --> 12:02.300
There.

12:02.400 --> 12:04.700
Looks like the bus
picked up some extra baggage.

12:04.700 --> 12:07.300
Route schedule indicates next stop...

12:07.400 --> 12:09.000
...Sin City.

12:09.100 --> 12:11.600
I want access to
every single surveillance camera

12:11.700 --> 12:14.100
Vegas has turned on.
Check office buildings,

12:14.200 --> 12:17.000
warehouses,
restaurants, department stores.

12:17.100 --> 12:19.300
Look in sewer systems if you have to.

12:19.300 --> 12:23.300
ATMs! Freeman Street
and Main to be exact. 1 2:45PM.

12:23.300 --> 12:28.200
Bank records indicate they withdrew...

12:28.300 --> 12:31.600
...the entire contents of the machine.
Fifteen thousand dollars.

12:31.700 --> 12:34.400
And also. . . they never used a card.

12:34.500 --> 12:37.900
They never even
touched the machine. Not once.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.700
These EBEs
possess some extraordinary skills.

12:41.800 --> 12:44.800
Bingo! Here's the
cab company security camera.

12:44.900 --> 12:47.500
Keep your eyes
on the back door of the cab.

12:49.700 --> 12:51.400
Right there.

12:51.500 --> 12:54.700
Synchronous satellite feed.
Get me a license plate.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.200
Ground transport, now.

12:57.300 --> 13:01.100
And, no matter what
they appear to look like, gentlemen,

13:01.200 --> 13:03.000
they're not children.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.000
They're not even human.

13:21.200 --> 13:24.700
Are your parents gonna be OK
with you guys spending all this money?

13:24.700 --> 13:26.800
We have agreed upon a financial deal.

13:26.900 --> 13:29.100
If your concern
is regarding compensation...

13:29.200 --> 13:31.400
My concern is the fact
that I got a couple of kids

13:31.500 --> 13:33.700
in the back of my cab
with a big wad of cash,

13:33.800 --> 13:36.700
with a drop-off location
that's in the middle of nowhere.

13:36.800 --> 13:40.200
In my book, that's a little chapter
called "running away."

13:40.300 --> 13:43.000
[man on radio] Jack, you better be
getting desert miles on that fare.

13:43.100 --> 13:46.000
And they better be able to pay.

13:46.100 --> 13:47.800
And you better get me an ETA!

13:47.900 --> 13:50.500
- Capisce?
- I'm losing reception, Dominick.

13:50.600 --> 13:51.800
[Dominick] Jack? Jack!

13:51.900 --> 13:52.900
Oh, come on.

13:55.600 --> 13:59.400
Jack Bruno, the vehicles behind us
are indicating a pattern of pursuit.

13:59.400 --> 14:01.300
There's no vehicles following...

14:02.900 --> 14:06.500
At your rate of speed versus theirs,
they will overtake our vehicle...

14:06.600 --> 14:08.800
Relax, kid.
I'm just gonna let them pass.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.300
Open road, people! It's all yours.

14:42.500 --> 14:44.700
What did I tell you?
Nobody's following us.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.100
- I'm the king of these roads...
- Jack Bruno!

15:00.700 --> 15:02.700
I said I was out, and I meant it!

15:03.700 --> 15:05.200
Who is Mr. Wolfe, Jack Bruno?

15:06.000 --> 15:08.300
How do you know that...? [grunts]

15:08.400 --> 15:09.900
Get down, now!

15:35.200 --> 15:39.000
- Hold on.
- [brakes squealing]

15:43.700 --> 15:45.400
He is just a cab driver, right?

15:50.500 --> 15:53.800
Jack Bruno, it would appear
we have not eluded them.

15:53.800 --> 15:56.600
I'm so over this.
Stay down! Stay down!

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Seth, no. It's not a good idea.

16:00.100 --> 16:02.400
- I have to try.
- It's too dangerous.

16:08.200 --> 16:09.600
Look out!

16:25.500 --> 16:26.800
Now what?

16:35.400 --> 16:36.700
Get out! Get out!

16:37.600 --> 16:39.300
[moaning]

16:39.400 --> 16:41.600
- Get out!
- [tires squealing]

16:43.900 --> 16:46.000
[panting]

16:47.300 --> 16:49.400
You two OK?

16:49.400 --> 16:51.300
- We are...
- Fine.

16:51.400 --> 16:53.400
We should just keep moving.

16:57.400 --> 17:00.700
Stay here. You didn't get the message?

17:00.800 --> 17:03.600
I told Frank and Marty I was out.

17:03.700 --> 17:06.500
You tell Wolfe for me
that he's gonna pay for my repairs.

17:06.599 --> 17:10.200
You are in way over your head here.

17:10.300 --> 17:11.300
[shouts]

17:16.400 --> 17:18.400
I want a complete profile on the driver.

17:18.500 --> 17:21.700
- You think he's collaborating?
- Either way, he's a liability.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.800
Get me some air transport.

17:27.900 --> 17:29.900
How are you two
holding up back there?

17:29.900 --> 17:31.200
We're fine.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.400
I'm sorry I dragged
you two into all this.

17:33.500 --> 17:36.300
There's no need
for you to apologize, Jack Bruno.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.400
You're not always the one to blame.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.900
But the urgency of our trip
has not decreased.

17:42.000 --> 17:46.100
Don't worry. I'll get you two
where you need to go. You've earned it.

18:05.300 --> 18:10.400
- We're here, Jack Bruno.
- Here? There's nothing here.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.700
[Jack] Somebody's
expecting you two, right?

18:20.800 --> 18:22.900
It doesn't look like anyone's home.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
Don't worry, Jack Bruno.
We'll soon be reunited with relatives.

18:28.500 --> 18:32.100
OK. Seven hundred and 20 dollars
and 50 cents.

18:32.200 --> 18:36.100
But after everything that went down
today, how about I knock off 25 percent.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.200
- Here.
- I also...

18:40.800 --> 18:44.400
OK, then. Goodbye to you, too.

18:47.100 --> 18:48.900
Five hundred percent tip?

18:50.100 --> 18:51.500
That's reasonable.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.200
[sighs heavily]

19:00.500 --> 19:02.500
Hey! You guys overpaid!

19:03.900 --> 19:05.200
By a lot!

19:11.300 --> 19:15.300
- Unbelievable.
- [glass shattering]

19:27.300 --> 19:29.300
Everything OK in there?

19:30.900 --> 19:33.400
[indistinct squeaking]

19:54.200 --> 19:55.500
Hello?

20:15.000 --> 20:16.800
[gasps]

20:16.900 --> 20:18.000
What just happened?

20:18.000 --> 20:21.600
Jack Bruno, you should not have
jeopardized your life by following us.

20:21.700 --> 20:23.300
What sort of trouble are you in?

20:23.300 --> 20:26.500
Return to your vehicle.
Your services are no longer required.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.500
- He's trying to help.
- We don't need help.

20:28.600 --> 20:33.200
Somebody's already been here looking for
it. We simply cannot trust any of them.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.000
Just us, Sara.

20:36.700 --> 20:39.300
We appreciate your efforts
to assist us, Jack Bruno.

20:39.400 --> 20:42.600
But my brother is right.
We can involve you no further.

20:42.700 --> 20:44.500
- Got it!
- Let's go!

20:44.600 --> 20:47.900
- Hey. Just tell me what's going...
- [Seth] This way.

20:47.900 --> 20:49.900
Hurry up, Sara.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.200
[buzzing]

21:05.300 --> 21:06.800
What is that?

21:15.100 --> 21:16.900
Whoa, hey!

21:21.800 --> 21:24.800
Don't go in the pimped-out fridge, Jack.

21:24.900 --> 21:26.400
[whispering] Hey!

21:45.500 --> 21:47.400
[beeping]

21:47.500 --> 21:49.500
[buzzing]

22:42.100 --> 22:43.500
[Jack] What is this place?

22:43.600 --> 22:45.700
- [beeping]
- This way.

22:47.600 --> 22:48.800
Hey, hey. Hey.

22:53.700 --> 22:55.400
[beeping]

23:00.400 --> 23:03.300
- Hey!
- [beeping rapidly]

23:05.900 --> 23:06.900
Sara, it's here!

23:32.400 --> 23:35.100
[gurgling]

23:39.100 --> 23:42.900
- [stuttering] What is it?
- It is what we came for, Jack Bruno.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.900
Really? Is anyone else looking for it?

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
Say, the person
who trashed everything upstairs?

23:49.100 --> 23:51.000
We think so. It is very valuable.

23:51.100 --> 23:53.100
Which is why it was vital
that we locate it first.

23:53.200 --> 23:56.400
What makes you sure whoever else
wanted it isn't still looking for it?

23:56.500 --> 23:58.500
- [door slams]
- [all gasp]

24:01.100 --> 24:04.600
Shh! Shh! Go. Go. Go.

24:05.900 --> 24:07.000
Go.

24:13.300 --> 24:16.000
[rustling, branches snapping]

24:20.800 --> 24:22.300
Run! Run! Run!

24:25.800 --> 24:27.400
[gasping]

24:29.800 --> 24:30.800
Ah!

24:32.100 --> 24:33.400
Oh!

24:34.300 --> 24:35.600
[grunts, moans]

25:09.400 --> 25:10.800
Ah!

25:15.400 --> 25:17.800
- Jack Bruno!
- Kids!

25:28.300 --> 25:29.600
Go, go, go, Sara!

25:33.100 --> 25:34.300
[both scream]

25:36.400 --> 25:37.400
Come on.

25:44.500 --> 25:45.900
Jack Bruno!

25:48.100 --> 25:49.500
Seth!

25:53.700 --> 25:55.300
[Jack yells]

26:01.900 --> 26:03.300
[Sara] Ah!

26:08.600 --> 26:10.500
Come on! We got to go! We got to go!

26:24.800 --> 26:27.300

27:08.300 --> 27:09.300
Get in!

27:12.400 --> 27:13.700
Ah!

27:32.900 --> 27:35.300
How's your brother doing?

27:35.400 --> 27:37.400
- His system has the ability...
- I will be fine.

27:37.400 --> 27:40.000
It is important we gain much distance
from this location.

27:40.100 --> 27:41.900
I'm happy you're feeling better,

27:42.000 --> 27:44.800
'cause you're gonna need
your strength when you explain

27:44.900 --> 27:46.600
just what happened back there!

27:55.100 --> 27:58.300
Here's the deal: the cab
doesn't move until your mouths do.

27:58.400 --> 28:01.500
- So start talking.
- The information you are seeking

28:01.500 --> 28:03.800
is not within
your grasp of understanding.

28:03.800 --> 28:07.000
We are dealing with issues
outside the realm of... your world.

28:07.100 --> 28:08.500
Hey, I'm a cab driver, OK?

28:08.600 --> 28:11.500
I have had plenty of worldly experi...

28:11.600 --> 28:13.900
Experiences.

28:16.200 --> 28:17.600
[Seth] Sara! We have to go!

28:22.300 --> 28:23.700
What is it?

28:26.600 --> 28:27.600
Hang on!

28:32.400 --> 28:34.000
[Jack] Hold on!

29:08.100 --> 29:09.900
We can't let him destroy it, Sara.

29:12.100 --> 29:14.800
Who is he?
And this time I need real answers.

29:14.900 --> 29:17.100
- It's a Siphon.
- A what?

29:17.200 --> 29:21.200
He's an assassin trained to pursue his
target until his mission is completed.

29:21.300 --> 29:23.800
And his mission is?

29:23.900 --> 29:27.000
[humming]

29:27.000 --> 29:28.300
[Sara] Us.

30:04.800 --> 30:07.300
[panting]

30:11.300 --> 30:13.100
[engine starts]

30:33.300 --> 30:35.200
Is there a safer route, Jack Bruno?

30:38.100 --> 30:39.800
Not unless you know how to fly.

30:50.800 --> 30:52.500
[all shouting]

30:57.500 --> 30:59.200
Get down!

31:08.900 --> 31:09.900
Jack Bruno!

31:16.200 --> 31:18.400
Come on, come on. Hold it together!

31:19.600 --> 31:22.300
- [train horn blows]
- Oh, come on!

31:23.500 --> 31:25.000
Faster! Faster!

31:26.400 --> 31:27.600
It won't go any faster!

31:28.900 --> 31:30.100
- Sara!
- Ah!

31:40.100 --> 31:41.200
Hold on!

31:50.900 --> 31:52.100
Watch out!

32:02.500 --> 32:06.400
[man] Jack Bruno. In and out of juvie
and state pens since he was a kid.

32:06.500 --> 32:08.100
Grew up poor in Midland, Texas.

32:08.200 --> 32:12.200
Showed promise cutting his teeth
driving demolition derby and dirt track.

32:12.300 --> 32:15.100
Ironically, at age 1 6,
his parents died in a car wreck.

32:15.200 --> 32:17.100
At 1 7 he ran away from his foster home

32:17.200 --> 32:21.700
and he headed to Las Vegas in the hopes
of going from stock car to NASCAR.

32:21.800 --> 32:26.200
Instead he found work as a wheel man
for Andrew Wolfe, the Vegas crime boss.

32:26.300 --> 32:29.300
His last bust was two years ago,
grand theft auto.

32:29.400 --> 32:32.100
He got out, went legit,
and he's been driving a cab ever since.

32:32.200 --> 32:34.400
Just spoke to
Jack Bruno's boss at Yellow Cab.

32:34.400 --> 32:37.000
Bruno took a fare
a significant distance out of the city.

32:37.100 --> 32:40.400
Dispatcher claims he's been unable
to make contact for several hours.

32:40.500 --> 32:42.200
Does the cab have a tracking device?

32:42.300 --> 32:45.500
LoJack. Until it
stopped transmitting 28 minutes ago.

32:45.600 --> 32:48.500
For some crazy reason,
the last location was on train tracks.

32:53.200 --> 32:58.500
- No. We cannot trust him.
- I know we can, and we must.

32:58.600 --> 33:01.400
[chuckling]

33:01.500 --> 33:06.000
Couple of kids, big wad of cash.
What could go wrong?

33:14.300 --> 33:16.300
- You're frustrated, Jack Bruno...
- No.

33:16.400 --> 33:20.400
No more "Jack Bruno this, Jack Bruno
that." I've been asking for answers...

33:20.500 --> 33:22.200
You know the answers, Jack Bruno.

33:22.300 --> 33:25.200
My brother and I
are indeed not from your planet.

33:27.200 --> 33:30.100
That's it? So that's it? Mystery solved?

33:30.200 --> 33:32.600
You two want me to believe
that you're both aliens?

33:32.700 --> 33:34.800
- It is the truth.
- Really?

33:34.900 --> 33:36.600
Well, you don't look like aliens.

33:36.700 --> 33:38.800
What does an alien
look like, Jack Bruno?

33:38.800 --> 33:41.500
You know what aliens look like.
Little green people

33:41.600 --> 33:45.800
with antennas and laser guns and,
"Take me to your leader, Earthlings."

33:45.800 --> 33:47.500
Ooh!

33:47.600 --> 33:51.800
You require some sort of proof. He
thinks we're insulting his intelligence.

33:51.900 --> 33:53.500
You think? You just can't drop

33:53.600 --> 33:56.300
the "we're aliens" bomb
just like that on somebody.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.900
I know I've seen some
pretty weird things today,

33:58.900 --> 34:01.100
but you can't expect me
to believe that...

34:09.100 --> 34:11.699
I have the ability
to move objects with my mind.

34:11.699 --> 34:15.000
- That's impossible.
- No, it's quite possible.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.800
On our planet as well as yours.

34:16.900 --> 34:20.000
You don't do it because you haven't
learned to use your full brain capacity.

34:20.000 --> 34:24.000
No, I don't do it
because it's kind of creepy,

34:24.100 --> 34:26.300
and I really would like you to stop.

34:31.900 --> 34:33.000
Jack Bruno!

34:37.800 --> 34:39.500
[engine sputtering]

34:39.600 --> 34:41.800
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on!

[man] Train engineer is banged up, but
alive. Last thing he saw in the tunnel

35:15.100 --> 35:17.000
was our taxi and a set of flying lights.

35:17.100 --> 35:19.200
He figured it must have
been a small plane.

35:19.300 --> 35:21.900
Small plane? Whoa.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.700
You think there's a chance
there's a second ship?

35:24.800 --> 35:28.400
You have the ability to fly at the speed
of light, yet you use a beat-up cab?

35:28.500 --> 35:29.400
I don't think so.

35:29.500 --> 35:31.900
Secure the site.
Catalog every piece of debris.

35:32.000 --> 35:36.300
I want to know what's train,
what's cab and what's left.

35:52.300 --> 35:55.100
[engine sputtering]

36:11.200 --> 36:15.500
- Hello! Anyone here?
- [man] Yeah, we're closed!

36:15.600 --> 36:17.700
Oh. There you are.
I know you're closed,

36:17.800 --> 36:20.300
but we've experienced
car trouble, I was hoping...

36:20.400 --> 36:23.400
Still closed. Experience your
car trouble when we're open.

36:23.500 --> 36:26.500
I'll work on that next time.
But this time I need you...

36:26.600 --> 36:28.300

36:28.400 --> 36:31.300
The thing that will convince
Eddie Cortez to reopen for business

36:31.400 --> 36:33.300
will be a significant amount of money.

36:34.200 --> 36:37.300
Wait a minute. Do I know you?

36:37.400 --> 36:40.100
No. Absolutely not.
You don't know them from anywhere.

36:40.200 --> 36:42.600
I'll pay you double your rate.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.400
- Why not triple?
- Done.

36:44.600 --> 36:46.300
Huh?

36:49.500 --> 36:51.900
What did you get in a fight with,
a rhinoceros?

36:53.000 --> 36:56.200
- [chuckles] Poor rhino.
- Poor rhino! I know.

36:56.200 --> 36:58.900
[all laughing]

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
[Eddie] I don't
even know where to start.

37:01.100 --> 37:03.500
Where you could start
is replacing the front shocks

37:03.600 --> 37:06.200
and the tie rods, patch up
the radiator, fix the exhaust,

37:06.300 --> 37:08.800
and if you have four tires,
I'll take those. You got one hour.

Come on, sit, sit. Sit down.

37:49.100 --> 37:52.100
I hope you do not act upon
your thought of making a fast break

37:52.200 --> 37:55.000
out of the back door of Ray's,
escaping Stony Creek,

37:55.100 --> 37:56.700
never to look back at us again.

My sister also has
the gift of telepathy.

38:00.800 --> 38:02.600
She can read the minds
of those nearest to her.

38:02.600 --> 38:07.400
Really. You tell your sister that here,
on Earth, reading minds: very rude.

38:07.500 --> 38:09.300
Don't do that.

Hey, guys. Welcome to Ray's.

Wow. Look at the two of you.

Uh, what do you mean,
look at the two of them?

38:21.100 --> 38:25.200
They look like just two
regular, innocent, all-American kids.

Who look like they just rolled around
in a pigpen right before dinner.

- Sheriff Antony.

You drop that fare yet?

No, it's really,

that you are scared and confused,

39:41.300 --> 39:44.600
- or the Air Force, not me.
- If you abandon us now,

39:44.700 --> 39:46.800
our mission will be in serious jeopardy.

39:46.800 --> 39:49.600
Look, I'm just trying
to be honest here, OK?

39:49.700 --> 39:53.100
- I'm the wrong guy.
- A wise human once said,

39:53.200 --> 39:54.900
"You are what you think you are."

39:54.900 --> 39:56.900
Why don't you find that guy and ask him?

39:57.000 --> 39:59.700
It was the Buddha. He's unavailable.

40:00.900 --> 40:04.700
How is it that beings on your planet
can be so large in form,

40:04.800 --> 40:06.600
yet feel so small inside?

40:10.000 --> 40:11.900
Maybe you need help, too, Jack Bruno.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.700
[phone rings]

40:16.100 --> 40:19.200
- Dominick, I told you...
- [Henry] Are they safe, Jack?

40:24.100 --> 40:26.600
- Who is this?
- My name is Henry Burke.

40:26.700 --> 40:29.100
I work within the Department of Defense.

40:29.200 --> 40:31.900
I handle their more... sensitive cases.

40:31.900 --> 40:33.600
What do you mean, "sensitive?"

40:33.600 --> 40:37.300
I suspect we both know
the answer to that question.

40:37.400 --> 40:40.600
They're just kids. They don't
want trouble, and neither do I .

40:40.700 --> 40:43.000
Good. Then we're all on the same page.

40:43.100 --> 40:45.700
Trouble is
the last thing I want as well.

40:45.700 --> 40:49.100
But what I do want,
and I'm counting on you

40:49.200 --> 40:53.200
to help me here,
are your two passengers.

40:55.900 --> 40:57.500
What are you gonna do with them?

40:57.600 --> 40:59.500
Do you care this much about everyone

40:59.500 --> 41:03.500
that gets into your cab?
You're a convicted felon, Jack.

41:03.600 --> 41:07.200
You've spent most of the day
breaking one law after another,

41:07.300 --> 41:09.400
for what, for them?

41:13.000 --> 41:15.400
- What do you want me to do?
- Not make a scene.

41:15.400 --> 41:19.300
You walked them into Ray's, you can
walk them out. I'll take it from there.

41:19.400 --> 41:22.100
And to show my appreciation
for your trouble,

41:22.200 --> 41:23.900
I'll wipe your slate clean.

41:25.400 --> 41:27.900
Just walk away, huh?
No harm, no foul?

41:28.000 --> 41:29.800
That's right. Just walk away.

41:29.900 --> 41:33.100
You've got five minutes, Jack,
and then it's all over.

41:33.900 --> 41:35.600
Five minutes. I'll see you then.

41:40.100 --> 41:42.100
[rifles cocking]

41:42.200 --> 41:46.200
I don't trust him. Cover all the exits.

41:51.600 --> 41:53.500
They're here for us, aren't they?

41:55.700 --> 41:57.100
Yeah. They are.

41:59.300 --> 42:01.200
- I knew we couldn't trust him.
- Excuse me?

42:01.300 --> 42:02.800
- Too late. We have to run!
- Wait.

42:02.900 --> 42:05.900
I was wondering what your town's
policy is regarding firearms.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
Excuse me?

42:07.100 --> 42:09.300
There's a lot of guns
coming in right now.

42:15.300 --> 42:16.700
Come on. Come on.

42:19.300 --> 42:21.200
[woman] I think he's over here.

42:23.100 --> 42:25.000
[muffled music playing]

42:31.500 --> 42:33.500
[muffled singing]

42:38.000 --> 42:39.400
Can I help you boys out?

42:39.500 --> 42:42.400
Official government business.
Excuse me.

42:42.500 --> 42:46.000
Officially my town.
That makes it my business.

42:46.100 --> 42:49.100
[â™ª Brokedown Cadillac:
Boogie Woogie Saturday Night]

42:50.900 --> 42:54.500
- Mr. Carson.
- [screaming]

42:55.200 --> 42:56.500
[stops singing]

43:08.200 --> 43:11.600
- You're making a big mistake, sheriff.
- I'll take my chances.

43:11.700 --> 43:13.900
Dude, I told you I should have a gun.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.900
Now might not be the best time
to bring that up... dude.

43:19.600 --> 43:21.100
This is not good.

43:24.500 --> 43:28.400
Shh. [whispering] Follow me.

43:35.900 --> 43:37.500
Up there.

43:39.500 --> 43:40.900
OK.

43:43.200 --> 43:45.500
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

43:50.000 --> 43:53.700
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

44:00.200 --> 44:03.400
- [dialing]
- [grunts]

44:06.900 --> 44:09.700
It's locked from the outside.
We got to find another...

44:09.800 --> 44:11.500
Hey, hey, hey!

44:17.200 --> 44:19.600
Or we could do that, whatever that is.

44:19.700 --> 44:22.700
My brother has the ability
to control his molecular density

44:22.800 --> 44:25.200
which allows him
to phase through solid objects

44:25.300 --> 44:27.300
or withstand the greatest of impacts.

44:29.200 --> 44:31.800
That's neat. Real neat.

44:34.700 --> 44:39.000
You've got some mighty big friends in
some mighty big places. You check out.

44:56.100 --> 44:58.300
[dog growling]

45:03.100 --> 45:05.000
Hi, little fella.

45:09.500 --> 45:11.600
[dog whimpering]

45:16.300 --> 45:18.200
We appreciate your understanding.

45:19.800 --> 45:21.200
Let's go.

45:25.300 --> 45:27.400
We got an open hatch
leading to the roof.

45:27.500 --> 45:29.100
We're on our way.

45:32.400 --> 45:34.100
Eddie! Time's up. We got to go.

45:34.200 --> 45:36.500
Go? I still got
a lot of work to do on her.

45:39.200 --> 45:41.900
Next time we're in town,
we'll make an appointment.

45:43.400 --> 45:45.000
- You want my card, or...
- No.

45:58.300 --> 46:01.800
Taxi's on the move. I want every
possible escape route locked down.

46:01.800 --> 46:03.900
I want that cab and everyone in it!

46:04.200 --> 46:05.600
Too many of them to outrun.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.200
Whatever you're doing, keep doing it.

46:22.600 --> 46:24.000
Ah!

46:26.500 --> 46:28.600
[man shouting indistinctly]

46:31.400 --> 46:32.900
Say goodbye to Stony Creek!

46:35.500 --> 46:39.600
What? No, no, not now! Come on!

46:39.700 --> 46:43.300
Sara. Sara, are you doing this?

46:43.300 --> 46:48.200
Sara, I said... Oh! Absolutely not!

46:48.300 --> 46:51.100
This junkyard is not going with us.

46:51.200 --> 46:53.400
I am done picking up stray passengers.

46:53.500 --> 46:56.100
- [gunshots]
- [tires squealing]

47:07.600 --> 47:10.000
Those guys who were
chasing us were the same ones

47:10.100 --> 47:11.800
- from the highway, right?
- Yes.

47:11.900 --> 47:14.000
It is vital you take us
to their base of operation.

47:14.100 --> 47:17.000
You want me to take you to
the guys who are trying to kill you?

47:17.000 --> 47:19.200
Let me explain to you
how we do things here on Earth.

47:19.300 --> 47:21.700
People who want you dead, you avoid.

47:21.800 --> 47:25.500
That way you... mm-mmm... stay alive.
Make sense?

47:25.600 --> 47:29.700
No one on your planet will stay alive
if we do not return to our planet.

47:29.800 --> 47:32.100
In order to return, we need our ship.

47:32.100 --> 47:36.000
Those men who were trying to kill us
have stolen our ship. Make sense?

47:40.500 --> 47:42.700
Where do you suggest
we begin our search?

47:42.800 --> 47:44.700
I don't suggest
we begin searching at all.

47:44.800 --> 47:47.900
I do suggest we go back to Vegas
and I drop you off where you got on.

47:48.000 --> 47:51.200
- You, too.
- [whimpers]

47:51.300 --> 47:54.400
It's just as I thought.
No human is gonna help us.

47:54.500 --> 47:55.900
Especially not this human.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.700
Hey. Easy on the human-bashing, OK?

47:58.800 --> 48:01.100
Some of my best friends
just happen to be human.

48:01.200 --> 48:03.500
Even if I helped,
I wouldn't know where to begin.

48:03.600 --> 48:06.900
I don't know anything
about UFOs or aliens or...

48:07.000 --> 48:08.500
Who's Dr. Alex Friedman?

48:11.100 --> 48:13.200
She's actually somebody who can help.

48:13.300 --> 48:16.500
And, for the record,
she happens to be human.

48:17.900 --> 48:18.900
[dog grunts]

48:22.600 --> 48:24.600
No sign of the taxi from anyone yet.

48:24.700 --> 48:28.400
Extend the search. They're out there.

48:35.700 --> 48:39.500
- [dog growling]
- Sara.

48:39.500 --> 48:43.100
He would appreciate you pulling over
so that he can relieve himself.

48:43.200 --> 48:46.900
We don't have time for that. He should
have went before we left Stony Creek.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
He isn't pleased with your attitude.

48:49.100 --> 48:50.700
Really? Is that the way he feels?

48:50.800 --> 48:55.100
You remind him
that I'm a man and he's a dog.

48:55.100 --> 48:59.300
And I'm not about to have this
or any conversation with a dog.

48:59.400 --> 49:02.000
So my answer is still no.

49:04.200 --> 49:06.500
[barking]

49:11.400 --> 49:12.700
Junkyard says thank you.

49:14.600 --> 49:16.800
Did he, now?
Is there anything else he wants?

49:16.900 --> 49:21.800
Oh. He said he would love
a bone or a meaty treat.

49:21.800 --> 49:24.700
Top of my to-do list. Just get in.

50:11.300 --> 50:12.900
[woman] Taxi!

50:20.600 --> 50:21.900
Hey.

50:22.000 --> 50:25.200
I need you to keep the cab close
and give the dog some water.

50:25.200 --> 50:28.800
- And, uh, give him a meaty treat.
- [barking]

50:33.200 --> 50:37.800
OK. So stay close to me,
don't talk to anyone, nice and normal.

50:39.500 --> 50:44.300
I'm telling you.
He walked right past me. Bad move.

50:44.300 --> 50:47.400
This was captured
by a far-imaging telescope

50:47.500 --> 50:51.600
at the University of Bonn
less than 48 hours ago.

50:51.600 --> 50:54.000
What I want
to direct your attention to is this.

50:56.000 --> 51:00.300
- That looks like a smudge.
- Yes. [laughs] Yes, it does.

51:00.400 --> 51:02.500
Was it a spaceship?
Did they abduct you?

51:02.600 --> 51:03.600
Excuse me?

51:03.700 --> 51:06.400
- Were the aliens the Greys?
- Or the lizard people?

51:06.500 --> 51:09.200
What? No, I wasn't abducted by anyone.

51:09.300 --> 51:11.600
How do you know?
Dr. Harlan's last book

51:11.700 --> 51:14.800
was all about how the aliens
can erase your memory with probes.

51:14.900 --> 51:17.100
- Donald Harlan's book?
- You may have been probed.

51:17.200 --> 51:20.300
- It's pure science fiction.
- [crowd groaning]

51:20.400 --> 51:25.600
I am talking about science fact here,
hard data, not crop circles.

51:25.700 --> 51:28.300
Have you ever actually
been inside a crop circle?

51:28.400 --> 51:32.100
I have. It was huge.
It's where the mother ship landed,

51:32.200 --> 51:36.000
where they took me on board,
where I was married to an alien woman.

51:36.100 --> 51:38.800
That is it.
I will not answer any more questions

51:38.900 --> 51:42.800
about alien abductions,
crop circles or Dr. Harlan.

51:42.900 --> 51:46.200
Is that clear? If we could just
get back to the matter at hand.

51:46.200 --> 51:48.200
People, hello, excuse me.

51:48.300 --> 51:50.800
I promise it will be worth it.
The blue nebula...

51:50.900 --> 51:55.400
We got a hit on Bruno's license plate.
They're back in Vegas.

51:55.500 --> 51:59.300
[woman on PA] Attention.
The foundation has been rescheduled...

52:02.800 --> 52:06.500
The cattle mutilation lecture doesn't
start for an hour. But grab a seat.

52:06.600 --> 52:08.700
This place will be packed. It always is.

52:08.800 --> 52:11.600
- We're here to see you, actually.
- Oh.

52:11.700 --> 52:14.100
It's Jack Bruno. We met earlier.

52:14.200 --> 52:16.000
We did?

52:16.100 --> 52:19.700
Cab... airport to hotel... driver.

52:19.800 --> 52:23.900
Oh. The nonbeliever. What are the odds?

52:24.000 --> 52:25.900
Is there someplace we can talk?

52:27.100 --> 52:29.900
The, uh... crowds in here
making you uncomfortable?

52:30.000 --> 52:31.800
Even more private than this.

52:31.900 --> 52:33.700
Look, no offense, but I'm pretty busy...

52:33.800 --> 52:37.400
She's doubting her thesis on
Gliese 581 and Alcubierre's warp drive.

52:40.500 --> 52:44.000
- How did you know that?
- Oh, it gets a lot better. Trust me.

52:46.500 --> 52:49.300
- [Alex] Are you insane?
- I just thought you, of all people,

52:49.300 --> 52:51.000
would understand and want to help.

52:51.100 --> 52:54.100
Why, because I'm the nutjob
speaking at the UFO convention?

52:54.100 --> 52:57.700
- Don't answer that.
- I know it sounds really crazy.

52:57.800 --> 53:00.700
Ya think? Hey.
Please don't touch that.

53:00.800 --> 53:02.700
You captured an image of our ship.

53:02.800 --> 53:06.900
The smudge? You're telling me
you think the smudge is your spaceship?

53:07.000 --> 53:10.300
No, we don't think it's our spaceship.
We know it is our spaceship.

53:11.800 --> 53:13.500
That's it. I'm out.

53:13.600 --> 53:15.800
If you'll excuse me,
I'll grab my laptop...

53:31.300 --> 53:34.600
Oh. They can also
do all this stuff, too.

53:38.900 --> 53:39.900
Who are you?

53:41.600 --> 53:42.600
Show her.

54:19.700 --> 54:21.600
[chuckles]

54:23.600 --> 54:26.600
This is... huge.

54:26.700 --> 54:29.300
I have so many questions,
though you are the answers,

54:29.400 --> 54:31.300
here, standing right in front of me.

54:31.400 --> 54:33.600
[clears throat]

54:33.700 --> 54:37.500
I'm sorry. I'm very excited. Right.

54:38.900 --> 54:40.800
W... Where are you from?

54:40.900 --> 54:44.600
Our planet is located
some 3,000 light-years from Earth.

54:45.900 --> 54:48.000
Space travel of such sizable distance...

54:48.100 --> 54:50.000
Using a paradoxical
passage in the unbounded...

54:50.100 --> 54:51.500
Wormholes. That's it.

54:51.600 --> 54:55.000
[laughs] My presentation at SETI
National Convention was right.

54:55.100 --> 54:59.800
Interstellar travel is possible using
wormholes as a shortcut through space.

54:59.900 --> 55:02.300
That was my first guess as well,
the wormholes.

55:04.000 --> 55:05.200
Continue, doctor.

55:07.400 --> 55:10.400
- Why did you come to Earth?
- Our planet is dying.

55:10.400 --> 55:12.200
Millennia of neglect has rendered

55:12.300 --> 55:14.400
- our atmosphere unbreathable.
- Familiar.

55:14.500 --> 55:16.700
Our parents are scientists
who have studied Earth's

55:16.800 --> 55:19.300
climates in hopes of finding
a solution for our planet.

55:19.400 --> 55:21.100
Our people's fears began to rise.

55:21.200 --> 55:24.400
Our parents discovered something
our leaders were interested in.

55:24.500 --> 55:28.400
Your planet makes a suitable
living environment for our kind.

55:28.500 --> 55:33.400
It would be simplest to abandon
our dying planet and... occupy yours.

55:33.500 --> 55:35.700
Wait. I'm helping you
conquer my own planet?

55:35.800 --> 55:39.300
No. Most of the people on our planet
are fiercely opposed to this plan.

55:39.400 --> 55:41.400
Fear of extinction
triumphed among our people.

55:41.500 --> 55:43.600
But then our parents
discovered a solution.

55:43.700 --> 55:47.000
An experiment at an outpost here
was successful in regenerating life

55:47.100 --> 55:49.100
into all previous
dying plants and trees.

55:49.200 --> 55:52.500
Which would enable the re-oxygenating
of your poisoned atmosphere.

55:52.600 --> 55:55.200
- So what's the problem?
- Our military.

55:55.300 --> 55:57.600
They preferred invasion over science.

55:57.700 --> 56:00.400
Which is why we had to hurry
and retrieve the experiment.

56:01.300 --> 56:05.900
All proof that our planet can be saved,
and your planet spared, is in here.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.900
- Where are your parents?
- [Sara] They were arrested.

56:09.000 --> 56:10.700
We agreed to complete the task for them.

56:10.800 --> 56:15.100
- What about the assassin?
- Assassin? What assassin?

56:15.200 --> 56:18.500
The Siphon warrior series Deraniun 75
was created by our military.

56:18.600 --> 56:21.200
- They're bred to hunt?
- Bred to kill.

56:21.300 --> 56:24.700
If we don't return back home in time,
the invasion will proceed.

56:25.800 --> 56:28.100
We seriously need
to find your spaceship.

56:35.500 --> 56:37.400
How well do you know this guy?

56:37.400 --> 56:40.700
We've done a few panels
and debates together on opposite sides.

56:40.800 --> 56:43.200
But no one knows the shadow world of

56:43.300 --> 56:46.000
UFO government conspiracies
better than Harlan.

56:48.200 --> 56:49.500
Not now, Whitley.

56:50.700 --> 56:53.000
Well, hello, Dr. Friedman.

56:53.100 --> 56:55.400
So you've finally decided
to accept my offer

56:55.500 --> 56:57.600
of a romantic Benihana dinner for two.

56:57.700 --> 57:00.800
- Huzzah!
- What?

57:00.800 --> 57:04.800
Ahem. Uh. . . Three years ago,
a screening of the Cooper footage.

57:04.900 --> 57:08.000
You were in the fourth row,
second seat, in a saucy flower print.

57:08.100 --> 57:11.600
Sorry, I keep my work and
social life separate. I don't date...

57:11.700 --> 57:15.300
- ...colleagues.
- Colleagues. Indeed.

57:15.400 --> 57:18.100
Listen, we need to see
Harlan right away.

57:18.200 --> 57:21.200
Dr. Harlan is presently
unavailable for consultations.

57:21.300 --> 57:23.800
We're more than qualified
to answer questions.

57:23.900 --> 57:25.200
There is no time for that.

57:25.200 --> 57:28.700
It is a matter of life and death
that we see Harlan now.

57:28.800 --> 57:30.500
Life and death, ooh!

57:30.600 --> 57:34.800
Uber scary drama queen theatrics.
What's the 41 1 sitch?

57:34.900 --> 57:39.300
You're currently alive. Unless you
take us to Harlan, you'll be dead.

57:40.900 --> 57:43.500
We should...
Together if you want to. Right now.

57:47.100 --> 57:48.700
[Harlan] Go away!

57:48.700 --> 57:52.700
The book signing
is not till 4:30. Read the brochure.

57:52.800 --> 57:54.900
Harlan, it's Alex Friedman.

57:59.200 --> 58:03.700
Dr. Alex Friedman. Quelle surprise.

58:03.800 --> 58:06.600
We have to speak with you
immediately. It is important.

58:10.500 --> 58:15.100
So you're saying the three of you
witnessed this reported UFO crash.

58:15.200 --> 58:16.800
- That's right.
- We were wondering if

58:16.900 --> 58:18.900
there was any intel
amongst your sources.

58:19.000 --> 58:22.600
I hate lying. I really don't like lying.

58:22.700 --> 58:25.900
I can tell when people are lying to me.

58:26.000 --> 58:29.700
But, thankfully, your story checks out

58:29.700 --> 58:33.700
with all the reports I got from
SETI and NORAD and NASA.

58:33.800 --> 58:34.800
We have reason to believe

58:34.900 --> 58:38.500
government-sponsored operatives
recovered the spacecraft.

58:38.600 --> 58:41.800
OK. Back up a little.
This is not space camp.

58:41.900 --> 58:44.100
Let the experts do their work.

58:44.200 --> 58:48.200
You're very lucky, you two,
that you didn't come face to face

58:48.300 --> 58:50.900
with the aliens who were in that craft.

58:51.000 --> 58:55.800
They're like deadly praying mantises.
They eat your flesh.

58:55.900 --> 58:58.900
Oh. Yes, we are, indeed, lucky kids

58:59.000 --> 59:02.500
not to have had our
flesh eaten by the aliens.

59:02.600 --> 59:06.000
You got that right.
OK. Let's go to work here.

59:06.100 --> 59:10.200
I got an e-mail from a source
that sent me this sat-grab.

59:10.300 --> 59:12.700
Where would they take
the spaceship? 51 ? Nellis?

59:12.800 --> 59:17.100
- Wright-Patterson? Vandenberg?
- From the size and scope of the crash,

59:17.200 --> 59:19.900
I would say there's
only one possibility.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.500
- Witch Mountain?
- Witch Mountain.

59:21.600 --> 59:23.800
What, are we a singing group here?

59:23.900 --> 59:27.100
- Let me talk, and you guys nod a bit.
- I apologize. I'm sorry.

59:27.200 --> 59:28.700
Witch Mountain.

59:28.800 --> 59:32.200
Let's take a look.
Here we go. California.

59:32.300 --> 59:35.100
About 50 miles
from the border of Nevada.

59:35.100 --> 59:38.900
And it's one of our
top-secret facilities.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.600
I got a schematic here someplace.

59:41.600 --> 59:44.500
If you're planning on visiting, don't.

59:44.600 --> 59:48.200
When I say this place
is fortified up to the yin yang,

59:48.300 --> 59:50.400
I'm making an understatement.

59:50.400 --> 59:54.000
Here's the schematic.
And do you have the book?

59:54.100 --> 59:55.100
Yes, I do.

59:55.200 --> 59:58.500
All right, then, here's an aerial view.

59:58.600 --> 01:00:02.000
Thank you, Harlan, for everything.

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:05.000
[Harlan] Whatever trouble you're in...

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.700
...trust no one.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:11.200
[woman shouting]

01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:21.700
Thank you, both of you.

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:24.800
Seth and I understand
you don't have to go forward with us,

01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:27.900
- and yet you choose to.
- You're welcome.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.900
And don't worry.
We're gonna get you home. I promise.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.700
I'm gonna grab my stuff. Let's meet
upstairs in the convention, at my booth.

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:40.000
- Then we get your cab.
- Alex, uh, listen.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.300
- I can't let you come with us.
- What?

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.900
If half of what Harlan says
is true, it's too dangerous.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
They got in my cab.
They're my problem.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Um, no. I have spent my entire life
preparing for this moment.

01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:53.500
Now, when I have two actual aliens
in need of my help,

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:54.800
you want me to walk away?

01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:57.800
It's not gonna happen.
Man up, soldier. I'm in.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.800
Just lay low till we meet up.

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:04.100
Sure. Great. Lay low.
Easy. How hard could that be?

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:08.700
She thinks you're very handsome.

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:12.500
- Really?
- And smarter than you think you are.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.400
So she was thinking about me?

01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:18.000
At least as much
as you were thinking about her.

01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:23.200
So she didn't happen to mention
in her thoughts that I was...

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:24.700
It's showtime, everybody!

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:28.000
Space Expo Number Nine.
It's upstairs. Come on.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.400
- Should we go upstairs now?
- Yeah. Let's go upstairs.

01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:39.600
Do you think she was thinking about...?

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:43.300
Seth. Sara! Seth!

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:46.600
- Jack.
- I tried to warn you, Jack.

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:48.800
Mr. Wolfe doesn't take rejection well.

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:54.400
This is so not a good time.

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:57.200
- Ah! Oh!
- You're out of time, Jack.

01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:02.200
Well, well, well. If it isn't
the Rebel Alliance cab driver scum.

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:05.400
Not such a tough guy out
of your ship, are you, womp rat?

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:06.700
You're in our house now!

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:10.000
- Ah!
- [grunting]

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:15.500
Move! Move!

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:21.600
Hi! I'm Sunday.
Welcome to Planet Hollywood.

01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:24.200
Are you gentlemen here
for the UFO Space Expo?

01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:25.800
Wouldn't miss it.

01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:31.800
Seth! Sara!

01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:41.000
- Wow!
- Costume's great, man.

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:43.400
[man] Whoa!

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:47.600
Seth! Seth!

01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:49.700
Sara!

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:56.300
Seth. Sara.

01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:58.400
I'm sorry.

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:12.100
I sure hope we have enough fuelage
to get back to planet Earth, Conrad.

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:14.900
Fear not, Celeste.
We must get to the ship.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.600
- [groaning]
- Ah!

01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:21.100
[Celeste] My leg!

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:24.400
[Conrad] No!
Look at that beast from another galaxy.

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.100
It's so disgusting and scaly!

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:28.000
Didn't I tell you two
to stay by my side?

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.200
I heard you the first time.

01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:31.900
Is this reenactment an important
piece of Earth's history?

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.500
- Stand back, you beast!
- No. Come on. Let's go. We got to go.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.200
Jack Bruno.

01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:46.500
[applause]

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:50.500
Sara!

01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:57.100
Let's go! Let's go!

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
You're down!

01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:03.900
Everybody, down!

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.600
Stay down! Stay down! Stay down!

01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:08.600
Get down! You, down! Everybody, down!

01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:10.500
You with the blue hair, right there!

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:13.900
Best... convention... ever.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.500
[man] Not here! Move out!

01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:34.900
Other way. Other way.

01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:55.800
[gasps]

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:04.900
Sara, are you listening
to what I'm thinking?

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:09.200
- [crowd shouting]
- [jackpot alarms blaring]

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.800
Go! Go! Move it, move it!

01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:14.300
Keep going! Keep going!

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:20.200
Oh. That's me.

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:25.900
[jackpot alarms blaring]

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.400
Got to go!

01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:31.000
- What happened to laying low?
- Who lays low in Vegas?

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:34.700
Move, move! Get out of the way!

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:36.800
Move it! Get out of my way!

01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:02.600
[sirens wailing]

01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:29.900
We got them!
Our suspects. No one else interferes.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.000
[man] Do not move! Do not move!

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:37.700
Stay inside the vehicle!
Hands where we can see them!

01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:42.700
Greetings, Earthlings. [laughs]

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:12.800
I didn't even imagine they'd actually
look human, much less like kids.

01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:14.800
They're lucky you joined us, doctor.

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:17.200
We're lucky... you joined us.

01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:21.400
Luck has nothing to do with it.
It's pure science.

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:25.600
Chaos theory, the underlying order
in apparently random data.

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:27.800
So more like fate?

01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:31.200
Mmm... Science. Think about it.

01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:35.600
What are the odds that they would crash
near Vegas during a UFO convention?

01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:37.700
I got in your cab.
Then they got in your cab.

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:40.200
And now we're all
in Harlan's mobile home

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:44.500
loaded with his intel on where
their ship is. That is not luck.

01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:48.000
That is a predetermined order of
how things work in the universe.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.800
Have you always been this positive?

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:53.000
I have always been
a searcher for answers,

01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:56.200
though my folks would say
I was merely a daydreamer.

01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:58.300
How about you?

01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:01.600
Me? I'm a, uh,
much easier book to read.

01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:05.500
All my life my answers
have been "yes" or "no."

01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:08.100
Zero gray areas.

01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:13.300
Where does the Mustang fall?
A yes or a no?

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:15.100
That's not just any Mustang.

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:18.800
That's a 1 968
Ford Mustang GT 390 Fastback.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Steve McQueen's car in Bullitt?

01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:25.700
- You've never seen Bullitt?
- Uh, no.

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:29.899
Er... It's currently a no.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.700
But one day I'm gonna earn
that car, the honest way.

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:36.100
And then it will be my yes.

01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:41.600
- Jack?
- What's up, pal?

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.300
Are we there yet?

01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:48.100
- "Are we there yet?"
- Unbelievable.

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:50.300
Good in any universe, apparently.

01:08:50.399 --> 01:08:52.399
- Well, Alex?
- Yes.

01:09:09.899 --> 01:09:13.500
The maps are 30 years old,
but they're the best intel we've got.

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:17.100
Looks to be about five miles
from here to the entrance.

01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:18.300
OK.

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:20.800
Let's rock and roll.

01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:45.000
[Jack] There's gotta be
another entrance.

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:54.000
If the map's right,

01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:57.000
there are several service
tunnels spreading outward.

01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:59.300
- Worth looking for, right?
- Let's go.

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:03.000
- [thudding]
- Ah! Jack...

01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:04.800
- [Jack] Sara.
- [thudding]

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:08.800
- Sara! Seth!
- [indistinct radio chatter]

01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:15.500
Mr. Bruno and, I believe, Dr. Friedman.

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:18.500
- What did you do to them?
- [Henry] Consider yourself lucky.

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:21.200
I could have had you both
shot on sight for trespassing

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:23.400
and violation
of US government property.

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:27.000
Sara!

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:32.000
Ah!

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:40.600
There you go. All right.

01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:44.300
Sir. With all due respect,
you have to listen to me.

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:47.600
They came in peace.
We cannot respond with violence.

01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:49.700
The future of Earth depends on it.

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:52.300
It is absolutely vital
that they get home.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.100
They are home, Dr. Friedman.
They are now in my custody.

01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:01.400
"Custody?" You can't expect to
keep them prisoner and get away with it.

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:04.800
- They have rights.
- They're illegal aliens on US soil,

01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:06.400
without so much as a passport.

01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:10.900
The Patriot Act enables me to detain
them for as long as is necessary.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.900
You can't keep this quiet.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.900
The world has the right
to know that they exist.

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:20.000
And you're going to be the one
to blow the whistle, doctor?

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:25.300
A failed astrophysicist fired by three
universities for obsessing over UFOs

01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:28.300
teams up with an ex-con
in declaring that the government

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:31.800
has captured two normal-looking kids
and is holding them hostage

01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:34.700
inside a mountain that doesn't exist?

01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:38.100
It would be so much easier
to let you speak

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:42.400
than to deal with all the paperwork
involved with killing you.

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:45.600
- Someone will believe us.
- From behind bars?

01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:48.500
Let me remind you, Mr. Bruno,
as a convicted felon,

01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:52.500
you're looking at 20 years just for
standing on this mountain talking to me.

01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:53.700
Shall I go on?

01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:57.400
No. I get the message.

01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:02.500
Smart man. Give them a lift back down.

01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:06.300
What? That's it? It's over?

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:10.200
I'm sorry. I will not go back to prison.

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:12.700
[man] Let's go.

01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:22.300
Thankfully Seth and Sara didn't
have to witness how quickly you gave up.

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:25.700
I told them from the beginning it was
a suicide mission, I wasn't wrong.

01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:27.500
They trusted you. I trusted you.

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:30.500
Join the club of everybody else
in my life who I've disappointed.

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:33.500
They will dissect them
like frogs in biology. You know that.

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:35.500
It's not my problem and it never...

01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:37.300
Hey!

01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:55.600
By the way, that slap, very realistic.

01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:58.600
When did you know?

01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:01.700
You haven't bailed on the kids yet.
Why start now?

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:05.600
[indistinct chatter over PA]

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:10.300
How soon until
the subjects are prepped?

01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:11.900
They're heavily sedated.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Minimal med tests
proceeding within 48 to 72 hours.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.600
Unacceptable. Commence the procedure.

01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:21.900
We don't know enough
about their systems.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.700
Any sudden change
could terminate the subjects.

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:26.500
You can't just kill them.

01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:33.700
Mr. Pope. You would do well
not to forget what our mission is.

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:35.700
Our orders come from Washington,

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:39.700
and Washington wants answers
to some very complex questions.

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:42.100
Our goal is to provide those answers.

01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:46.700
Now, if you are doubting your ability...

01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:50.100
No... sir.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.100
Very good, then.
Commence the tests, Mr. Matheson.

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:59.000
Right away, sir. Initiating tests.

01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:09.300
- Here. Here.
- Coming... Almost...

01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:10.500
[both grunting]

01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:20.900
- After you.
- I'm right behind you.

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:23.500
Thanks.

01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:40.400
- Back up. Back up for a second.
- What?

01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:06.600
It's gonna be OK.
I'm gonna be here the whole time.

01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:09.400
I'll be right below you the whole time.

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:12.500
- I can.
- You can.

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:16.700
- Here I go. Oh, boy.
- That's it. Right here.

01:15:19.700 --> 01:15:21.700
- You got it.
- Here we go.

Oh, no, Jack. Exhaust furnace!

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:33.500
This way. Come here.
There's another tunnel right here.

- Yeah.

- Find the kids. Don't get caught.
- Good plan.

[Henry] We're very close to determining
the source of their powers.

Yes, sir, containment
is at a hundred percent.

And thank you
for sticking by me and the project.

a long time to get here,

it's been worth our previous failures.

- Seal it off!

you disobeyed his direct orders.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.600
Just shut it down!

01:27:50.700 --> 01:27:53.100
[man on PA] Gates closing in ten,

01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:55.400
nine, eight...

01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:57.500
- Watch out!
- ...six...

01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:00.000
- The door!
- ...four...

01:28:00.100 --> 01:28:01.400
The door! The door!

01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:03.800
- . . .two, one.
- The door!

01:28:07.900 --> 01:28:09.100
Whoo!

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:23.700
- You did it!
- We did it. We did it!

01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:26.600
- [rumbling]
- Whoa! What was that?

01:28:26.700 --> 01:28:29.900
The airlock's jammed.
I need to manually override the system.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.500
You two fly. Just tell me what to do.

01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:35.600
[wind howling]

01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:46.800
Ah!

01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:55.500
[all shouting]

01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:05.900
Alex, it takes two to pilot the ship.
I need you to take the controls.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.300
What? Are you insane?

01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:17.800
[grunting, panting]

01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:35.100
Jack!

01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:40.000
You're better with the mask on.

01:29:50.300 --> 01:29:51.800
[screaming]

01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:12.200
Ah!

01:30:28.300 --> 01:30:29.800
[Seth] Jack!

01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:47.800
Yes, he's here.

01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:50.900
Sir, it's Washington.
They have some questions for you.

01:30:58.300 --> 01:30:59.300
Sir?

01:31:01.300 --> 01:31:03.000
[Sara] You both must hurry.

01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:05.000
Only a matter of time
before they get here.

01:31:05.100 --> 01:31:07.700
- Don't worry about us.
- Sara and I want you to have this.

01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:12.200
As long as it's in your possession,
we'll always be able to find you.

01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:19.800
Thanks.

01:31:25.700 --> 01:31:29.300
Your parents will be very proud
of what you've done here.

01:31:34.300 --> 01:31:36.200
Thank you, Alex.

01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:44.200
I once said that we could never count
on humans to help us. Especially you.

01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:47.700
I was wrong, and for that I am sorry.

01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:49.500
You take care of yourself.

01:31:51.100 --> 01:31:53.900
And your sister, too. Do you understand?

01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:58.700
- Yes.
- Jack?

01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:08.600
You guys remember that, me and Alex...

01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:14.200
...we're only a wormhole away. OK?

01:32:14.300 --> 01:32:17.000
I want you to promise me something.

01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:20.600
Take care of Junkyard for me.

01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:24.000
- [barking]
- Anything you want.

01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:33.100
[Seth] It's time.

01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:38.000
[Sara] You're a good man, Jack.

01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:56.300
[man] If everything that
you wrote about in your book is true,

01:33:56.300 --> 01:33:58.400
why risk coming out
in the public at all?

01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:00.800
Why haven't you been
arrested yet, or worse?

01:34:00.900 --> 01:34:04.300
We decided right away that
the more public we went with the story,

01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:08.000
then the less likely we were
to... disappear.

01:34:08.100 --> 01:34:11.400
And so far, clearly, we've been right.

01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:14.600
- Thank you all so much for listening.
- Thank you.

01:34:14.700 --> 01:34:16.200
[cheering]

01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:21.600
Technically,
I planned the whole mission.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.300
[cheering]

01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:35.400
A big nebula guy. How's it going?

01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:37.100
- Hi, boys.
- Doctor.

01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:42.900
- Jack! Jack!
- [crowd shouting]

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.800
Howdy, boys. How you doing?

01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:47.300
He touched me!

01:34:48.700 --> 01:34:51.900
- [crowd shouting]
- Come back to us, please!

01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:00.000
Good boy.

01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:08.500
- Thank you.
- [beeping]

01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:26.600
[engine revving]

01:35:26.700 --> 01:35:28.800
[Jack] Here we go.
