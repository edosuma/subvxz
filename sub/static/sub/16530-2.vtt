00:01.069 --> 00:01.202
.

00:06.407 --> 00:07.341
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:07.975 --> 00:08.976
sexually based offenses

00:09.009 --> 00:11.612
are considered
especially heinous.

00:11.645 --> 00:14.248
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.282 --> 00:16.150
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.184 --> 00:17.418
are members of an elite squad

00:17.451 --> 00:19.520
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.553 --> 00:21.422
These are their stories.

00:23.191 --> 00:24.492
- My dad used to have
an expression.

00:24.525 --> 00:27.361
He said, "The greatest sin
any person can commit

00:27.395 --> 00:29.397
is the abuse of power."

00:29.430 --> 00:31.565
And the greatest
abuse of power

00:31.599 --> 00:33.501
was rape.

00:33.534 --> 00:36.170
It takes a woman
a long time to heal.

00:36.204 --> 00:39.073
And when the victim
isn't believed,

00:39.107 --> 00:40.541
when she goes through
the invasive process

00:40.574 --> 00:43.411
of having a rape kit
put together,

00:43.444 --> 00:45.413
and then it's stuck
on a shelf somewhere--

00:45.446 --> 00:49.283
and then the rape kit
is never, ever tested--

00:49.317 --> 00:50.451
we fail.

00:50.484 --> 00:51.619
We fail her.

00:51.652 --> 00:54.288
We fail so many women.

00:54.322 --> 00:57.591
I'm proud to say
today we did not fail.

00:57.625 --> 01:00.528
Thanks to the dedicated
efforts of law enforcement,

01:00.561 --> 01:01.629
the whole legal system,

01:01.662 --> 01:03.464
the victim's advocacy groups,

01:03.497 --> 01:06.134
and particularly my friend here,

01:06.167 --> 01:09.637
Lieutenant Olivia Benson of SVU,

01:09.670 --> 01:10.871
congratulations, Lieutenant.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.173
[applause]

01:12.206 --> 01:14.308
- Thank you.
Thank you.

01:14.342 --> 01:16.344
Mr. Vice President,
we are so honored

01:16.377 --> 01:18.379
to stand here today with you

01:18.412 --> 01:20.481
to announce that in
beginning to clear

01:20.514 --> 01:22.516
the national rape kit backlog,

01:22.550 --> 01:25.153
we have taken rapists
off the streets.

01:25.186 --> 01:26.587
We have prevented future crimes.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.722
We have given victims closure.

01:28.756 --> 01:33.194
And we have also righted
a terrible wrong.

01:33.227 --> 01:35.263
16 years ago,

01:35.296 --> 01:37.298
Sean Roberts was
convicted of a rape

01:37.331 --> 01:40.301
here in New York City
that he did not commit.

01:40.334 --> 01:43.537
By processing an untested
rape kit in Detroit,

01:43.571 --> 01:47.608
we were able to identify
the real rapist

01:47.641 --> 01:49.243
and set Sean free.

01:49.277 --> 01:50.478
[applause]

01:50.511 --> 01:53.514
[camera shutters clicking]

01:55.649 --> 01:58.552
- I want to thank everyone
who tested the kits.

01:58.586 --> 02:00.554
I've only been out
of prison for a month,

02:00.588 --> 02:02.623
but it already feels like
a second chance at life.

02:02.656 --> 02:05.359
I bear no ill will
towards Melanie Harper.

02:05.393 --> 02:07.461
She's as much a victim
as I am in this.

02:07.495 --> 02:09.630
This is a fresh start for me,

02:09.663 --> 02:12.500
Melanie,
and her daughter, Ashley.

02:12.533 --> 02:14.435
- We're looking forward
to the next chapter.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.270
- And my mother and I
want to make amends--

02:16.304 --> 02:17.938
have Sean in our lives.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.240
I'm getting married next month.

02:19.273 --> 02:20.508
I've invited Sean
to the wedding.

02:20.541 --> 02:22.410
- Thank you.

02:25.213 --> 02:27.448
Thank you for everything.

02:27.481 --> 02:30.418
- Seems like you've
all gotten close.

02:30.451 --> 02:32.453
- I'm just glad that
Sean's forgiven me.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.388
- It was a honest
mistake, Melanie.

02:34.422 --> 02:36.557
At the time,
you were sure it was him.

02:36.590 --> 02:37.625
- I was wrong.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.593
We were both wrong.

02:39.627 --> 02:41.329
- You ready to go, Mom?
- Yeah.

02:41.362 --> 02:43.464
- Last time I saw you,
you were six years old.

02:43.497 --> 02:44.965
Now you're getting married.
Congratulations.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.033
- Thank you.

02:46.066 --> 02:48.436
- We're taking Sean out
for his birthday tonight.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.571
- It's the first time
I can legally drink.

02:50.604 --> 02:53.541
- Well, have fun, and...

02:53.574 --> 02:55.343
stay safe.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.578
- Bye.

03:02.450 --> 03:04.518
- You okay with all this?
- I'm good.

03:04.552 --> 03:06.320
I'm just glad he's out of jail.

03:06.354 --> 03:08.256
- [exhales]

03:08.289 --> 03:09.457
Me too.

03:11.259 --> 03:12.226
- [sighs softly]

03:12.260 --> 03:15.329
- Thank you.
- Okay, yeah, um...

03:15.363 --> 03:18.332
[dark music]

03:18.366 --> 03:21.235
*

03:21.269 --> 03:22.703
- Detective Tutuola.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.272
- Melanie Harper asked for me?

03:24.305 --> 03:25.739
- Inside.
She's a mess.

03:25.773 --> 03:26.774
- What are we looking at?

03:26.807 --> 03:27.808
- Mother was sleeping,

03:27.841 --> 03:29.443
smelled smoke,
called it in.

03:29.477 --> 03:31.612
Girl was raped, strangled,

03:31.645 --> 03:34.548
stabbed, doused in bleach,
burned.

03:34.582 --> 03:41.289
*

03:41.322 --> 03:42.656
- Okay, Momma's here.
Momma's here, okay?

03:42.690 --> 03:44.024
Okay, it's gonna be okay.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.459
We're going to the hospital.
It's gonna be--

03:45.493 --> 03:46.527
- Melanie, what happened?

03:46.560 --> 03:47.661
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

03:47.695 --> 03:50.331
I came down and I--
I found her like this.

03:50.364 --> 03:52.266
- Did you see anything
or hear anybody?

03:52.300 --> 03:53.367
- Here, I'm right here.

03:53.401 --> 03:54.402
I heard a man.

03:54.435 --> 03:55.569
- Did you recognize his voice?

03:55.603 --> 03:57.305
- [panting]

03:57.338 --> 03:59.307
I think it was Sean.

03:59.340 --> 04:01.475
*

04:01.509 --> 04:02.776
- Sean Roberts?

04:02.810 --> 04:04.778
The guy we just
got out of prison?

04:04.812 --> 04:07.348
- Yeah.

04:07.381 --> 04:08.749
[siren wailing]

04:08.782 --> 04:11.251
*

04:13.387 --> 04:16.357
[dramatic music]

04:59.867 --> 05:00.668
- Ashley Harper was
raped and stabbed,

05:01.835 --> 05:03.904
and you think that Sean Roberts
is involved in this--how?

05:03.937 --> 05:06.039
- Well, Melanie said
she heard Sean's voice

05:06.073 --> 05:07.207
in the house.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.743
- Well, we know that they went
out together last night.

05:09.777 --> 05:10.911
Did you talk to him yet?

05:10.944 --> 05:12.413
- Well, considering the history,

05:12.446 --> 05:13.714
we figured we should
talk to you first.

05:13.747 --> 05:15.749
- Okay, all right.

05:15.783 --> 05:18.452
So what do we have?

05:18.486 --> 05:20.821
- Um, there's no sign
of forced entry,

05:20.854 --> 05:23.524
so Ashley probably did
know her attacker,

05:23.557 --> 05:25.426
and there's a kitchen knife
that's missing.

05:25.459 --> 05:26.960
- CSU's running the scene.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.129
Whoever did this,
they used bleach on her,

05:29.162 --> 05:30.431
they burned her--

05:30.464 --> 05:31.799
got rid of all DNA.

05:31.832 --> 05:32.800
- Who else was in her life?

05:32.833 --> 05:33.934
She just got engaged, right?

05:33.967 --> 05:35.002
- Right, we're tracking
down her fiancé,

05:35.035 --> 05:36.103
and we're going
through her texts,

05:36.136 --> 05:37.538
we're going through
her social media.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.973
- Okay, so run down
every single angle.

05:40.007 --> 05:43.076
Uh, security cams in the house--
in the neighborhood.

05:43.110 --> 05:45.579
Traffic cams.
Canvass the neighbors.

05:45.613 --> 05:47.080
We need to be sure

05:47.114 --> 05:49.883
about every single
detail on this.

05:49.917 --> 05:50.951
[phone buzzing]

05:50.984 --> 05:52.586
[sighs]

05:52.620 --> 05:54.054
Okay, Carisi's here.

05:54.087 --> 05:55.389
Loop him in.

05:55.423 --> 05:56.524
Have him talk to the fiancé.

05:56.557 --> 05:57.891
Rollins...

05:57.925 --> 06:00.994
Rollins, you talk to Sean.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.162
- Pulling me off the case?

06:02.195 --> 06:03.997
- No, actually,
I need to keep you on--

06:04.031 --> 06:06.166
you know, optics.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.035
- What's that mean?

06:08.068 --> 06:09.770
- If you step away
from the case,

06:09.803 --> 06:11.405
it'll look like you have a--

06:11.439 --> 06:13.173
something personal
with Sean, right?

06:13.206 --> 06:14.875
Give credibility
to his lawsuit.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.477
So just let Rollins
take the lead.

06:16.510 --> 06:18.479
- Got it.

06:18.512 --> 06:19.547
- [sighs]

06:22.149 --> 06:24.485
Ms. Harper,

06:24.518 --> 06:25.819
I'm so sorry.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.154
What did the doctors say?

06:27.187 --> 06:29.790
- She's still in surgery.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.859
She lost a lot of blood.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.126
The--the burns are--

06:33.160 --> 06:34.795
- It's okay.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.797
My detectives said that

06:36.830 --> 06:40.534
you heard Sean Roberts' voice
in your house last night?

06:40.568 --> 06:44.104
- Yes, um, he and Ashley
were talking.

06:44.137 --> 06:45.839
- Do you remember what time

06:45.873 --> 06:47.074
you heard them talking?

06:47.107 --> 06:49.443
- Um, must've been
about midnight.

06:49.477 --> 06:50.277
- Okay.

06:50.310 --> 06:51.579
- And I took a shower,
and then I--

06:51.612 --> 06:53.981
- Right.
- I went to sleep.

06:54.014 --> 06:56.116
So...have you talked to Sean?

06:56.149 --> 06:57.985
I mean, maybe he saw...

06:58.018 --> 06:59.620
- We're gonna talk to him.

06:59.653 --> 07:00.921
Listen to me.

07:00.954 --> 07:04.492
Ms. Harper, can you
think of anyone

07:04.525 --> 07:06.093
who would want to
hurt your daughter?

07:06.126 --> 07:08.161
- No.
No one.

07:08.195 --> 07:09.863
- What about the fiancé?

07:09.897 --> 07:10.864
Was he at the dinner?

07:10.898 --> 07:11.932
- Zach?
No.

07:11.965 --> 07:13.867
No, he--he didn't like Sean.

07:13.901 --> 07:15.536
He and Ashley were
arguing about that, so--

07:15.569 --> 07:17.070
oh, I got to call him.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.939
[gasps]

07:18.972 --> 07:20.541
Oh...

07:20.574 --> 07:21.842
- What?

07:21.875 --> 07:23.511
- Ashley's engagement ring--

07:23.544 --> 07:26.013
it wasn't on her finger.

07:29.082 --> 07:32.019
[somber music]

07:32.052 --> 07:34.922
*

07:34.955 --> 07:37.958
[crying]

07:41.529 --> 07:42.930
[rapping on door]

07:42.963 --> 07:44.565
- Sean Roberts!

07:44.598 --> 07:46.099
*

07:46.133 --> 07:48.569
- Maybe we waited too long,
and he got spooked, ran.

07:48.602 --> 07:51.539
- This guy's got 30 million
reasons not to leave town.

07:51.572 --> 07:52.640
[locks unlatching]

07:52.673 --> 07:54.074
- Hey, Sean.

07:54.107 --> 07:55.275
Can we talk to you
for a minute?

07:55.308 --> 07:56.276
- Why?

07:56.309 --> 07:57.945
- Mind if we come inside?

07:57.978 --> 07:59.647
- Yeah, I do.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.082
What's this about?

08:02.115 --> 08:06.219
- Ashley Harper was raped
and murdered last night.

08:06.253 --> 08:07.988
- What?

08:08.021 --> 08:09.590
Oh, my God.

08:09.623 --> 08:12.593
W-what happened?

08:12.626 --> 08:14.595
Ashley's dead?

08:14.628 --> 08:17.097
Melanie must be freaking out.
I-I have to go.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.265
- Before--before you do,

08:18.298 --> 08:21.268
can we just ask you
a few questions?

08:21.301 --> 08:22.903
- You want to talk to me?

08:22.936 --> 08:25.205
You don't think that I--

08:25.238 --> 08:26.273
do I need a lawyer?

08:26.306 --> 08:27.340
- Why would you need a lawyer?

08:27.374 --> 08:29.142
- Anytime you talk to the cops,
you need a lawyer.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.310
That's what you taught me.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.145
- Were you at Ashley's
house last night?

08:32.179 --> 08:34.915
- No, we--we had
dinner together,

08:34.948 --> 08:36.149
and then she left early.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.250
- You see her after dinner?

08:37.284 --> 08:39.553
- No.
- What time did you leave?

08:39.587 --> 08:41.288
- 11:00, 11:30.

08:41.321 --> 08:43.156
- Where'd you go?

08:43.190 --> 08:44.324
- Strip club.

08:44.357 --> 08:47.160
- Is there where
you hurt your hand?

08:47.194 --> 08:48.228
- Yeah.
- Right.

08:48.261 --> 08:49.329
Did you go alone?

08:49.362 --> 08:51.131
- No, with a buddy.

08:51.164 --> 08:52.265
- Ah.
- A buddy.

08:52.299 --> 08:53.634
What kind of buddy?

08:53.667 --> 08:55.636
- A guy from the inside, okay?

08:55.669 --> 08:57.037
Jeff Nichols.

08:57.070 --> 08:58.639
Yeah, he was at
my birthday dinner.

08:58.672 --> 09:00.073
He can vouch for me.
- Great.

09:00.107 --> 09:02.042
Where can we find this Jeff?

09:02.075 --> 09:04.211
- Uh, Hell's Gate Diner.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.180
Now, if you're not
gonna arrest me,

09:07.214 --> 09:08.281
then you need to leave,

09:08.315 --> 09:10.317
because I need to call Melanie.

09:12.720 --> 09:13.687
[door closes]

09:13.721 --> 09:15.022
- Sure ain't helping himself.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.089
- Mm-mm.

09:16.123 --> 09:17.625
- Put a unmarked car
on this block

09:17.658 --> 09:19.126
in case he decides to run.

09:19.159 --> 09:21.061
- You think he really had
something to do with this?

09:21.094 --> 09:23.096
- I hope not.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.767
*

09:26.800 --> 09:28.201
Jeff Nichols?

09:28.235 --> 09:29.402
- Uh-huh.

09:29.436 --> 09:33.206
- Were you with Sean Roberts
and Ashley Harper last night?

09:33.240 --> 09:34.374
- Yeah.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.710
Yeah, after dinner,
we went to the ballet

09:36.744 --> 09:38.011
on 10th Avenue.

09:38.045 --> 09:39.813
Ask the stripper--
some Russian lesbian.

09:39.847 --> 09:41.181
We were with her
most of the night.

09:41.214 --> 09:42.650
- Sean told you to say that?

09:42.683 --> 09:44.351
- No.
- Listen.

09:44.384 --> 09:46.386
Ashley Harper was murdered
last night,

09:46.419 --> 09:48.055
so you're gonna need
to come clean.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.757
- I am.
I swear.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.124
- Listen, dude.

09:51.158 --> 09:53.360
You're on parole.

09:53.393 --> 09:54.662
Don't lie to me.

09:54.695 --> 09:57.698
I'll throw your ass
back in prison.

10:01.068 --> 10:03.103
- Okay.
Okay.

10:03.136 --> 10:06.239
Sean just called me--
begged me to vouch for him.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.808
Said you guys were
jamming him up

10:07.841 --> 10:09.777
just like last time.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.144
- Did he even come
to the club?

10:11.178 --> 10:12.212
- Yeah.
[sighs]

10:12.245 --> 10:14.114
But he came late--
about 2:00.

10:14.147 --> 10:15.182
- Okay.

10:15.215 --> 10:17.751
Uh, did you notice
a cut on his hand?

10:17.785 --> 10:18.819
- I don't remember.

10:18.852 --> 10:21.689
Look, all I know is,
Sean would never hurt that girl.

10:21.722 --> 10:22.656
He adored her.

10:22.690 --> 10:24.725
All night, he was a shoulder
for her to cry on.

10:24.758 --> 10:25.859
- Why was she crying?

10:25.893 --> 10:27.194
- Her fiancé.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.295
She, she--I don't know.

10:28.328 --> 10:31.631
He was, like, threatening
to break off the engagement.

10:33.867 --> 10:36.136
- I can't believe
Ashley's really...

10:38.806 --> 10:41.208
What, uh...

10:41.241 --> 10:42.843
what happened?

10:42.876 --> 10:43.844
- We're not sure.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.846
We were hoping you could
help us out with that.

10:45.879 --> 10:47.114
- What are you talking about?

10:47.147 --> 10:50.283
- When was the last time
you saw Ashley?

10:50.317 --> 10:52.753
- Yesterday, before she went
to dinner with that convict.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.454
- Sean Roberts.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.857
Let me ask, were you and Ashley

10:56.890 --> 10:58.759
fighting about him?

10:58.792 --> 10:59.760
- What?
No.

10:59.793 --> 11:01.795
- Ah, wrong answer.

11:01.829 --> 11:04.698
- 'Cause you sent
half a dozen texts.

11:04.732 --> 11:07.167
7:10, "It's over."

11:07.200 --> 11:09.469
7:30, "I want my ring back."

11:09.502 --> 11:11.238
8:00, "I'm gonna get that ring."

11:11.271 --> 11:12.239
Should I go on?
- No.

11:12.272 --> 11:13.206
- Come on, you must have known

11:13.240 --> 11:14.908
we were going to look through
Ashley's phone.

11:14.942 --> 11:16.209
You see, when you lie to us,

11:16.243 --> 11:18.078
it makes us curious.

11:18.111 --> 11:21.114
- I was pissed.

11:21.148 --> 11:22.215
We made plans last night,

11:22.249 --> 11:26.119
and she blew me off
for that guy Sean.

11:26.153 --> 11:26.954
I get it.

11:26.987 --> 11:29.857
He spent 16 years
in prison, but--

11:29.890 --> 11:32.292
and he was innocent, but that
doesn't make him a saint.

11:32.325 --> 11:33.326
- Well, that's fair enough,

11:33.360 --> 11:34.762
but where were you last night--

11:34.795 --> 11:37.197
after midnight?

11:37.230 --> 11:38.866
- I was at a bar--
Dakota Bar.

11:38.899 --> 11:40.133
- The Dakota Bar.

11:40.167 --> 11:42.169
That's two blocks
from Ashley's house.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.370
- And my apartment.

11:43.403 --> 11:44.304
Ask the bartender.

11:44.337 --> 11:46.239
I was there from midnight
until closing.

11:46.273 --> 11:47.407
- You were there
the entire time?

11:47.440 --> 11:51.278
Four solid hours at the bar?

11:51.311 --> 11:52.479
- No.
- No?

11:52.512 --> 11:54.748
- Some girl spilled
red wine on my shirt.

11:54.782 --> 11:56.850
I went home to change.
Then I went back to the bar.

11:56.884 --> 12:00.120
- Oh, that's very
convenient for you.

12:00.153 --> 12:02.122
- I didn't kill Ashley.

12:02.155 --> 12:03.356
*

12:03.390 --> 12:05.759
Are you--are you guys crazy?

12:05.793 --> 12:08.762
I have nothing
to do with this.

12:08.796 --> 12:10.497
- As of now,
who is our main suspect,

12:10.530 --> 12:11.765
Sean or Zach?

12:11.799 --> 12:13.901
- As of now?
Both.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.869
- Or an unknown.

12:15.903 --> 12:18.238
I've been searching through
Ashley's social media.

12:18.271 --> 12:20.173
She's got a lot
of male followers.

12:20.207 --> 12:21.241
- Okay, okay, so let's, uh...

12:21.274 --> 12:22.242
What do we have on Sean?

12:22.275 --> 12:23.510
- So, the timeline is tight.

12:23.543 --> 12:26.146
Ashley was attacked
sometime between midnight,

12:26.179 --> 12:27.848
when Melanie heard her voice--

12:27.881 --> 12:29.349
- And Sean's voice.

12:29.382 --> 12:31.551
- And 1:20,
when Melanie called 911.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.553
- Sean claims he wasn't
in the house.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.556
- But Sean doesn't
have an alibi.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.559
From 11:30, when we confirmed
he left the restaurant,

12:39.592 --> 12:42.262
to 2:05 when he arrived
at the strip club.

12:42.295 --> 12:44.164
- And Zach doesn't
have an alibi either.

12:44.197 --> 12:45.532
- No, actually, he does.

12:45.565 --> 12:47.534
The, uh, bartender
at the Dakota Bar

12:47.567 --> 12:49.169
confirmed somebody spilled
red wine on him.

12:49.202 --> 12:51.471
He went home to change.
He was back in 15 minutes.

12:51.504 --> 12:52.940
- Okay.

12:52.973 --> 12:54.241
So back to Sean.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.275
- Well, we got Sean's hair
at the scene,

12:55.308 --> 12:56.576
but he's been there a lot
in the past few weeks.

12:56.609 --> 12:57.811
There's no blood.

12:57.845 --> 12:58.678
- Even though he cut his hand?

12:58.711 --> 13:00.547
- Bleach and fire.
That's the point.

13:00.580 --> 13:03.416
- Well, there's also the missing
kitchen serrated knife,

13:03.450 --> 13:05.986
which the M.E. thinks could be
the murder weapon.

13:06.019 --> 13:09.322
- Look, I know no one wants
to think Sean Roberts

13:09.356 --> 13:10.390
is good for this--

13:10.423 --> 13:11.825
- Maybe he's not.

13:11.859 --> 13:14.461
Just, I mean--look,
two weeks ago,

13:14.494 --> 13:16.496
Ashley got a private DM

13:16.529 --> 13:18.331
from a guy named
Charlie Dobkins.

13:18.365 --> 13:21.468
She told him to stop looking in
her window and being "creepy."

13:21.501 --> 13:22.870
- Looking in her window?

13:22.903 --> 13:24.371
A neighbor, an ex?

13:24.404 --> 13:26.273
Find out.

13:26.306 --> 13:30.277
*

13:30.310 --> 13:32.880
- Hey, we're looking for
Charlie Dobkins.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.915
- Yeah, he around?

13:34.948 --> 13:36.383
- Check the roof.

13:36.416 --> 13:39.552
- Roof, huh?
Thank you.

13:39.586 --> 13:46.559
*

13:46.593 --> 13:48.495
Hey, Rollins, I think
I got something.

13:48.528 --> 13:50.263
- This looks right into
the Harpers' apartment--

13:50.297 --> 13:52.866
right into Ashley's bedroom.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.301
- Uh, I got weed, pills,

13:54.334 --> 13:57.537
hand lotion,
Coney Island whitefish...

13:57.570 --> 13:58.638
- Hey.
- Underwear, women's jewelry.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.908
- You Charlie?

14:00.941 --> 14:02.309
- Hey!

14:02.342 --> 14:03.543
- Damn.

14:03.576 --> 14:06.546
[suspenseful music]

14:06.579 --> 14:07.881
- Hey!
- Hold up there, chief.

14:07.915 --> 14:08.916
- I didn't do nothing!
I didn't!

14:08.949 --> 14:10.250
- No?
No?

14:17.124 --> 14:17.824
- So, Melanie,
it looks like, uh,

14:18.658 --> 14:21.561
we found your missing
kitchen knife.

14:21.594 --> 14:23.163
- Where?

14:23.196 --> 14:24.597
- On the roof across
the street,

14:24.631 --> 14:26.967
with the neighbor's kid.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.636
- And he had pictures
of Ashley on his phone.

14:29.669 --> 14:33.373
- How well did you and
your daughter know him?

14:33.406 --> 14:34.641
- Not well.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.309
I always thought
he was a little odd.

14:36.343 --> 14:38.078
- Well, it looks like
he was stalking her.

14:38.111 --> 14:40.380
We found a stash on his roof--

14:40.413 --> 14:42.649
women's jewelry, underwear.

14:42.682 --> 14:45.285
- So it would be helpful
if you could identify

14:45.318 --> 14:49.322
anything that--that may have
belonged to Ashley.

14:51.324 --> 14:53.193
- Did you find her
engagement ring?

14:53.226 --> 14:56.063
- Uh, no, we're looking
for it now, though.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.597
- You think he did it?

14:57.630 --> 14:59.166
He's the one
that killed Ashley?

14:59.199 --> 15:01.201
- I promise, if he is,
we'll find out.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.603
- Come on.
Let's go.

15:04.671 --> 15:06.173
- I want to call my mom.

15:06.206 --> 15:07.707
- Okay, sure, Charlie.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.309
But first you need to talk to us

15:09.342 --> 15:10.978
about that love nest
on your roof.

15:11.011 --> 15:12.179
- And then I can call her?

15:12.212 --> 15:13.413
- One thing at a time, Charlie.

15:13.446 --> 15:15.015
Did you take
this picture of Ashley

15:15.048 --> 15:17.050
through her bedroom window?

15:21.154 --> 15:23.156
- She was always standing
in front of it,

15:23.190 --> 15:24.691
like she wanted me to see.

15:24.724 --> 15:26.693
- Oh.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.195
- Shyvon said it was wrong.

15:28.228 --> 15:30.097
- Who's Shyvon?

15:30.130 --> 15:32.699
- My girl, the one I--

15:32.732 --> 15:34.301
use the condoms with.

15:34.334 --> 15:36.703
- So you got two girls,
Ashley and Shyvon?

15:36.736 --> 15:38.271
You're a ladies' man?

15:38.305 --> 15:40.273
- Shyvon's my girlfriend.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.642
I just looked at Ashley.

15:42.675 --> 15:44.077
- And you took
those photos, right?

15:44.111 --> 15:45.078
- Yeah.

15:45.112 --> 15:46.679
- So what about last night?

15:46.713 --> 15:50.283
She was there posing,
looking at you?

15:50.317 --> 15:53.086
Thought, "Maybe she wants
to have sex with me?"

15:53.120 --> 15:54.454
Right?

15:54.487 --> 15:55.688
- Do you think so?

15:55.722 --> 15:57.357
- Yeah, Charlie, I do.

15:57.390 --> 15:58.658
I mean, why else
would she be posing

15:58.691 --> 16:00.260
in front of a window like that?

16:00.293 --> 16:01.694
- I know.
It made me crazy.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.163
- And then that's
what happened, right?

16:03.196 --> 16:04.464
She kept teasing you.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.333
Maybe she wanted you
to come over.

16:06.366 --> 16:07.400
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:07.434 --> 16:09.436
She definitely liked
to tease me.

16:09.469 --> 16:10.637
[chuckles]

16:12.405 --> 16:14.341
- I'm looking for
Charlie Dobkins.

16:14.374 --> 16:15.642
He got picked up by detectives.

16:15.675 --> 16:16.643
- Can I help you?

16:16.676 --> 16:18.078
- I'm Charlie's mother.

16:18.111 --> 16:19.212
This is his girlfriend, Shyvon.

16:19.246 --> 16:20.747
- You have to let him go, now.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.382
- Can't do that.
He's being questioned.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.084
- Charlie will just say
whatever you want,

16:24.117 --> 16:25.252
but he didn't hurt that girl.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.787
- You got proof?

16:27.820 --> 16:29.689
- Just tell him, Shyvon.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.724
- He was with me all night.

16:36.296 --> 16:38.331
- Lieutenant, he was
just about to confess.

16:38.365 --> 16:39.432
- Great.

16:39.466 --> 16:40.367
Except he didn't do it.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.169
- Well, the kid admits
to watching Ashley,

16:42.202 --> 16:43.303
taking pictures--

16:43.336 --> 16:44.171
- And getting aroused
by her last night.

16:44.204 --> 16:45.705
- He was having sex
with his girlfriend

16:45.738 --> 16:47.707
at the time of the murder,
and there's video--

16:47.740 --> 16:49.476
lots of it.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.044
- You're crazy, Charlie.

16:51.078 --> 16:53.080
They're gonna see us up here.
Yes, they are.

16:53.113 --> 16:55.115
- Girlfriend said they spent
the whole night together.

16:55.148 --> 16:57.484
Time code's good--
alibi to 1:15.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.819
There he is having sex,
goofing off.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.521
Charlie's on camera
the whole time.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.523
- Okay, seen enough.

17:03.556 --> 17:06.326
- Okay, so how'd he
get the knife?

17:06.359 --> 17:07.827
- Girlfriend says he picked
it up off the curb

17:07.860 --> 17:10.097
after he saw the killer toss it.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.132
- So he's not a suspect.
He's a witness.

17:12.165 --> 17:13.466
So take him back
to that rooftop,

17:13.500 --> 17:15.402
find out exactly where he was,

17:15.435 --> 17:17.737
what he saw, and when he saw it.

17:18.805 --> 17:20.307
- You were standing here, right?

17:20.340 --> 17:21.808
Now tell me--
tell me exactly

17:21.841 --> 17:23.076
who you saw.

17:23.110 --> 17:24.277
- I saw a white man.

17:24.311 --> 17:25.178
- About his age.
- Right.

17:25.212 --> 17:27.280
And he dropped something
in the trash bags,

17:27.314 --> 17:28.448
and I wanted to know
what it was,

17:28.481 --> 17:29.449
so I went down and got it.

17:29.482 --> 17:30.850
- Right, the knife.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.252
Right?
That's great, Charlie.

17:32.285 --> 17:33.720
We got that, all right?

17:33.753 --> 17:35.722
So let's--let's think about
something else, maybe.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.424
Like, what about the time?

17:37.457 --> 17:40.127
- You said you saw the man
after Shyvon got here.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.228
- Yeah.

17:41.261 --> 17:42.829
- Good, now was it
before or after

17:42.862 --> 17:45.332
you and Shyvon had sex?

17:45.365 --> 17:47.200
- Before, maybe.

17:47.234 --> 17:48.468
Uh...
- I need you to be sure.

17:48.501 --> 17:51.438
You sure?

17:51.471 --> 17:53.406
- After.
It was after.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.474
I'm not good with times--
- Okay.

17:54.507 --> 17:55.742
- Befores and afters like that.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.844
- Okay, you know what, Charlie?

17:57.877 --> 17:58.745
I like you,

17:58.778 --> 18:01.748
and I know you want
to cooperate, right?

18:01.781 --> 18:04.184
Listen, so I need you to focus.

18:04.217 --> 18:06.153
I'm gonna--I'm gonna show you
these pictures

18:06.186 --> 18:07.520
one at a time.

18:07.554 --> 18:10.290
All right, you just--
you let me know who you saw.

18:10.323 --> 18:12.159
- I can do that.
- All right.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.760
- Because you want
to help Ashley, right?

18:13.793 --> 18:15.128
You liked her.
We know you liked her.

18:15.162 --> 18:16.296
- Yes, I did.

18:16.329 --> 18:17.864
- Okay.
- She was pretty...

18:17.897 --> 18:19.866
like you.

18:19.899 --> 18:21.434
[chuckles]

18:22.902 --> 18:25.772
- What about this guy?

18:25.805 --> 18:28.175
- Uh, if I say yes,

18:28.208 --> 18:30.843
would--would that
be helping Ashley?

18:30.877 --> 18:32.379
And you?

18:35.515 --> 18:37.784
- We just want the truth,
Charlie.

18:40.220 --> 18:43.590
Okay?
That's all we want.

18:43.623 --> 18:46.793
Don't say yes if
you're not sure.

18:52.199 --> 18:53.500
It's okay.

18:53.533 --> 18:56.503
- Yes, I'm sure.

18:56.536 --> 18:59.506
[dark music]

18:59.539 --> 19:03.643
*

19:03.676 --> 19:05.512
- Sean Roberts?
[banging door]

19:05.545 --> 19:06.646
NYPD.

19:06.679 --> 19:08.915
- Open up.

19:08.948 --> 19:10.250
- This is harassment.

19:10.283 --> 19:11.651
- We need to search
the premises.

19:11.684 --> 19:14.254
- You have a warrant?
- Yes, we do.

19:14.287 --> 19:20.260
*

19:20.293 --> 19:21.561
- My lawyer will be here
any minute, just so you know.

19:21.594 --> 19:22.962
- Yeah, that's your right.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.897
- Got something.

19:24.931 --> 19:27.400
Looks like
Ashley's diamond ring.

19:27.434 --> 19:30.203
Found it in the sink drain.

19:30.237 --> 19:32.539
*

19:32.572 --> 19:35.542
- How did it get there, Sean?

19:35.575 --> 19:36.843
- I don't know.

19:36.876 --> 19:38.245
- Sean Roberts,
you're under arrest

19:38.278 --> 19:40.413
for the rape and murder
of Ashley Harper.

19:40.447 --> 19:41.981
- You have the right
to remain silent.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.284
You have the right to--
- I know my rights!

19:44.317 --> 19:45.418
I've been through
this drill before!

19:45.452 --> 19:47.420
I was innocent then!
I'm innocent now!

19:55.362 --> 19:56.128
- Buchanan sure swooped
in here fast.

19:57.430 --> 19:59.532
- Guy's got a nose
for the big cases.

19:59.566 --> 20:00.767
- What did you find?

20:00.800 --> 20:03.303
- Traces of blood on
one of his shoes

20:03.336 --> 20:04.203
that could be Ashley's,

20:04.237 --> 20:05.738
and then, of course,
there's the ring.

20:05.772 --> 20:06.973
- And you're the one
who found it.

20:07.006 --> 20:08.541
- Search warrant,
by the book.

20:08.575 --> 20:10.543
- That's right.
I was just looking in his sink.

20:10.577 --> 20:11.978
Checked the drain--
there it was.

20:12.011 --> 20:14.647
- And we spoke to Zach,
Ashley's fiancé,

20:14.681 --> 20:17.450
who confirmed that it
was indeed her ring.

20:17.484 --> 20:20.587
- Good.
We have a strong case.

20:20.620 --> 20:23.523
- My client's civil lawyer
extends his thanks.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.458
The price tag for his lawsuit
just went up--

20:25.492 --> 20:26.993
for harassment.

20:27.026 --> 20:28.828
- We've got Ashley's
engagement ring.

20:28.861 --> 20:31.264
We've got her blood in
his apartment and on his shoes.

20:31.298 --> 20:33.400
- But I'm sure there's
a reasonable explanation.

20:33.433 --> 20:36.403
- There is:
Detective Tutuola.

20:36.436 --> 20:38.004
He's the defendant
in Sean's civil suit.

20:38.037 --> 20:39.339
He's the one who found
the ring, correct?

20:39.372 --> 20:41.308
- A frame-up, really?
That's your defense?

20:41.341 --> 20:43.510
I-I hope you're
getting a discount,

20:43.543 --> 20:45.278
because your attorney
isn't even trying.

20:45.312 --> 20:47.647
- Sean is not a murderer
or a rapist.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.649
He's never even
committed a crime.

20:49.682 --> 20:51.584
- You think I would
do that to Ashley?

20:51.618 --> 20:53.386
She was nice to me.

20:53.420 --> 20:54.621
She treated me like
I was decent--

20:54.654 --> 20:55.722
like a normal human being.

20:55.755 --> 20:56.823
- You raped and killed her.

20:56.856 --> 20:58.057
It's a hell of a way
to thank her.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.326
- I wouldn't do that to her!

20:59.359 --> 21:00.827
I know what it's like
to be raped!

21:00.860 --> 21:03.029
I went in when I was 18,
140 pounds.

21:03.062 --> 21:04.331
What do you think
happened to me?

21:04.364 --> 21:05.532
- It's all right, Sean.
Take it easy.

21:05.565 --> 21:06.833
We're done talking here.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.368
- Okay, then we'll
be taking Sean

21:08.401 --> 21:10.837
to be processed and arraigned.

21:10.870 --> 21:11.771
- Okay.

21:11.804 --> 21:14.574
- Is the jury gonna
buy this frame story?

21:14.607 --> 21:15.675
- He was innocent last time.

21:15.708 --> 21:16.876
The jury's gonna
feel sorry for him.

21:16.909 --> 21:18.411
- This case is different.

21:18.445 --> 21:20.547
- Let's hope we get
the same verdict.

21:21.814 --> 21:23.550
Ms. Harper.

21:23.583 --> 21:24.884
I'm ADA Rafael Barba.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.819
I'll be handling
your daughter's case.

21:26.853 --> 21:29.722
I'm so sorry for your loss.

21:29.756 --> 21:33.360
[somber music]

21:33.393 --> 21:34.861
- I was hoping
it was someone else.

21:34.894 --> 21:37.063
- We understand,
but the evidence

21:37.096 --> 21:39.065
is what it is.

21:39.098 --> 21:42.602
- I can't imagine what you
must be feeling right now.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.504
- You can't do this
to me again!

21:44.537 --> 21:47.474
Hey, Detective, do you think
I made you look bad?

21:47.507 --> 21:48.775
Is that it?
- Sean, enough!

21:48.808 --> 21:50.677
- Is it the lawsuit?
Hey, I won't take the money!

21:50.710 --> 21:53.513
Melanie--Melanie, you know
I wouldn't hurt Ashley!

21:53.546 --> 21:54.747
Don't let 'em do this!

21:54.781 --> 21:56.649
- [crying]

21:56.683 --> 21:58.418
- It's okay.

21:58.451 --> 22:01.421
*

22:01.454 --> 22:04.391
- Ashley was crying
about her fiancé.

22:04.424 --> 22:08.127
So Sean joked that
she should leave Zach for him,

22:08.160 --> 22:10.430
that--that he was gonna
be a millionaire.

22:10.463 --> 22:11.498
- And how did she respond?

22:11.531 --> 22:12.799
- She was playing along.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.701
She was--she was fine...

22:14.734 --> 22:16.669
[sighs]
Until Sean got drunk.

22:16.703 --> 22:20.573
And then, uh, he started
acting a little stupid.

22:20.607 --> 22:22.442
So Ashley and Melanie left.

22:22.475 --> 22:23.843
- Okay, so how did Sean react?

22:23.876 --> 22:26.446
- He felt bad.

22:26.479 --> 22:28.715
Said he wanted to go
to her house to apologize.

22:28.748 --> 22:31.684
- Okay, so...Sean liked Ashley?

22:31.718 --> 22:33.486
- Yeah, he really liked her.

22:33.520 --> 22:34.621
He--he thought she was hot.

22:34.654 --> 22:37.557
[chuckles]
He thought she liked him too.

22:37.590 --> 22:38.658
- So is that the real reason

22:38.691 --> 22:39.892
that Sean went to
Ashley's house?

22:39.926 --> 22:41.027
'Cause he really liked her?

22:41.060 --> 22:42.895
'Cause he thought he was maybe
gonna have sex with her?

22:42.929 --> 22:44.531
- Objection.
Leading.

22:44.564 --> 22:46.799
- Sustained.
- Nothing further.

22:48.535 --> 22:52.705
- So, Sean never told you
that, uh,

22:52.739 --> 22:53.840
he thought Ashley liked him

22:53.873 --> 22:56.943
or that he was interested in
having sex with her, did he?

22:56.976 --> 22:58.645
- Not exactly.

22:58.678 --> 23:00.647
It just seemed that way.

23:00.680 --> 23:01.781
- So you're a mind-reader.

23:01.814 --> 23:04.751
Any other special powers
we should let the jury in on?

23:04.784 --> 23:07.587
- Objection.
- Nothing further.

23:07.620 --> 23:08.821
Withdrawn.

23:11.491 --> 23:13.660
- Dr. Singh,
in your expert opinion,

23:13.693 --> 23:15.462
how difficult is
it to transition

23:15.495 --> 23:18.865
from being a wrongfully
imprisoned inmate

23:18.898 --> 23:20.733
to a free citizen?

23:20.767 --> 23:21.968
- It's exceptionally hard.

23:22.001 --> 23:23.436
Almost impossible.

23:23.470 --> 23:24.604
- Why is that?

23:24.637 --> 23:27.006
- Exonerees' attempts to
reconcile their incarceration

23:27.039 --> 23:30.777
with their innocence can
lead to intense suffering.

23:30.810 --> 23:33.480
The trauma they experience
is similar to the trauma

23:33.513 --> 23:34.881
suffered by veterans of war,

23:34.914 --> 23:35.915
torture survivors--

23:35.948 --> 23:37.984
- I'm sorry to interrupt you.

23:38.017 --> 23:41.020
What about an exoneree who has
been repeatedly raped in prison?

23:41.053 --> 23:43.656
- Well, these individuals
have even a harder time

23:43.690 --> 23:45.492
adjusting to life
on the outside.

23:45.525 --> 23:48.695
The rage and shame
caused by the rape

23:48.728 --> 23:50.997
is unlikely to remain
locked in prison.

23:51.030 --> 23:52.732
- Would someone like this
have a difficult time

23:52.765 --> 23:55.568
socializing with
the opposite sex?

23:55.602 --> 23:57.770
- Dating and sexual
relationships

23:57.804 --> 23:58.905
for someone with this profile

23:58.938 --> 24:00.507
are particularly challenging.

24:00.540 --> 24:02.542
They tend to misread social cues

24:02.575 --> 24:04.544
and to act out
in violent ways

24:04.577 --> 24:06.946
when they feel rejected
or humiliated.

24:06.979 --> 24:08.781
- So in your expert opinion,

24:08.815 --> 24:11.484
a man who'd been
wrongfully imprisoned

24:11.518 --> 24:12.985
for 16 years

24:13.019 --> 24:15.021
was a victim of rape...

24:16.723 --> 24:18.991
What is the likelihood
that someone like this

24:19.025 --> 24:22.962
would be able to live a normal,
law-abiding life upon release?

24:22.995 --> 24:25.532
- Unfortunately,
it's almost impossible.

24:25.565 --> 24:26.933
- Thank you.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.968
Nothing further.

24:31.771 --> 24:33.806
- Have you ever
met Sean Roberts?

24:33.840 --> 24:34.841
- No.

24:34.874 --> 24:36.609
- So your expert opinions

24:36.643 --> 24:37.977
don't apply to him specifically,

24:38.010 --> 24:39.579
do they?

24:39.612 --> 24:42.949
They're based on
other exonerees.

24:42.982 --> 24:43.950
- That's right.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.284
- So what you're saying is,

24:45.317 --> 24:47.787
your testimony is totally
irrelevant to Sean

24:47.820 --> 24:49.021
and a complete waste of time?

24:49.055 --> 24:52.024
- Objection.
- Sustained.

24:52.058 --> 24:54.694
- Nothing further.

24:54.727 --> 24:57.697
[tense music]

24:57.730 --> 25:00.299
*

25:00.332 --> 25:01.701
- Counselor,

25:01.734 --> 25:03.302
where would you
like your witness?

25:03.335 --> 25:04.737
- How are you, Charlie?

25:04.771 --> 25:05.972
- Nervous.
- All right.

25:06.005 --> 25:07.574
Ah, you'll be fine.

25:07.607 --> 25:08.875
Go have a seat over there.
I'll be right with you.

25:08.908 --> 25:09.909
- Right there.

25:12.044 --> 25:13.045
- How's he really doing?

25:13.079 --> 25:14.947
- He's okay.
A little jittery.

25:14.981 --> 25:17.550
- The thing is, he's--
he's not the brightest bulb,

25:17.584 --> 25:20.019
but if you--
if you take it easy with him,

25:20.052 --> 25:22.054
he'll calm down.

25:23.322 --> 25:24.490
- You haven't been
in the gallery.

25:24.523 --> 25:27.326
- Just in case you change
your mind and decide to call me.

25:27.359 --> 25:28.728
- You get why I can't, right?

25:28.761 --> 25:30.763
- Well, I get why
you think you can't.

25:30.797 --> 25:33.700
The DA put Sean away
for 16 years, not me.

25:33.733 --> 25:34.834
I did my job.

25:34.867 --> 25:35.935
I did it right then.

25:35.968 --> 25:37.069
I did it right this time, too.

25:37.103 --> 25:38.137
- I know.

25:38.170 --> 25:40.840
- I just want you to know,
I have nothing to hide.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.642
- I believe you.

25:42.675 --> 25:44.744
- Doesn't seem that way.

25:47.914 --> 25:50.617
- My girlfriend and I
had just had sex

25:50.650 --> 25:51.751
on the roof,

25:51.784 --> 25:53.986
and that's when I
saw Sean Roberts

25:54.020 --> 25:57.957
leave the house and toss
something in the trash.

25:57.990 --> 25:59.759
- What time was this?

25:59.792 --> 26:00.927
- 1:15.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.662
- Then what happened?

26:02.695 --> 26:05.064
- I went to see what he tossed.

26:05.097 --> 26:06.633
It was a knife.

26:06.666 --> 26:07.934
I picked it up.

26:07.967 --> 26:11.037
- You saw Sean Roberts leave
the Harper residence

26:11.070 --> 26:13.906
at 1:15 and throw
a knife in the trash?

26:13.940 --> 26:15.341
- Yes.

26:15.374 --> 26:16.643
- Okay.

26:16.676 --> 26:17.777
The knife has been
previously entered

26:17.810 --> 26:21.147
as People's Exhibit A.

26:21.180 --> 26:23.683
The same knife has been
determined to have

26:23.716 --> 26:25.785
Ashley's blood on it.

26:32.091 --> 26:34.160
- Hello, Charlie.

26:34.193 --> 26:37.864
So, you had a fun time on
the roof with your girlfriend.

26:37.897 --> 26:39.165
Lucky you.

26:39.198 --> 26:40.933
Can I ask you something?

26:40.967 --> 26:44.837
Had you been smoking pot
or drinking alcohol?

26:46.005 --> 26:48.074
- [laughs]
We smoked a little weed.

26:48.107 --> 26:50.142
- So, high on marijuana,

26:50.176 --> 26:52.812
through the black of night
at 1:15 in the morning,

26:52.845 --> 26:54.647
you're absolutely positive

26:54.681 --> 26:57.750
you saw Sean Roberts
down on the street?

26:57.784 --> 26:58.951
- I think so.

26:58.985 --> 27:00.419
It looked like him.

27:00.452 --> 27:03.690
Plus, Detective Rollins, uh--

27:03.723 --> 27:06.225
uh, yeah, I'm positive.

27:06.258 --> 27:08.895
- Plus Detective Rollins?

27:08.928 --> 27:11.998
Did she tell you
to say something?

27:12.031 --> 27:13.966
- No, not really.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.102
I said I thought
I saw Sean's face.

27:16.135 --> 27:19.872
- And she encouraged you
to say it was Sean?

27:19.906 --> 27:22.675
Maybe she nodded or smiled.

27:22.709 --> 27:25.144
- She patted me
on the shoulder

27:25.177 --> 27:27.747
and told me it was okay.

27:27.780 --> 27:29.749
I thought she wanted me
to say it was him.

27:29.782 --> 27:33.820
- Did she help you figure out
what time you saw him, too?

27:33.853 --> 27:34.821
*

27:34.854 --> 27:35.988
- I guess.

27:36.022 --> 27:37.724
I-I...

27:37.757 --> 27:40.192
I wasn't sure if I saw Sean

27:40.226 --> 27:43.429
leave before or after
Shyvon and I had sex.

27:43.462 --> 27:45.064
But she--
- She what?

27:45.097 --> 27:46.432
- Sh--

27:46.465 --> 27:48.768
*

27:48.801 --> 27:50.002
Sh--

27:50.036 --> 27:52.805
*

27:52.839 --> 27:54.741
- I know she's attractive.

27:54.774 --> 27:58.144
But don't look to her for help.

27:58.177 --> 27:59.946
Look at me, Charlie.

27:59.979 --> 28:02.481
Why did you say what you did?

28:02.514 --> 28:04.116
*

28:04.150 --> 28:07.186
- I thought she would like it
if I said after.

28:07.219 --> 28:08.020
And she was really nice.

28:08.054 --> 28:11.457
- So Detective Rollins
encouraged you--

28:11.490 --> 28:12.491
flirted with you--

28:12.524 --> 28:14.493
to say you had seen Sean Roberts

28:14.526 --> 28:16.829
leave Ashley's home at 1:15?

28:16.863 --> 28:18.164
- Objection: Mr. Buchanan
is putting words

28:18.197 --> 28:19.165
in this witness's mouth.

28:19.198 --> 28:21.300
- Overruled.
Answer the question.

28:21.333 --> 28:22.769
- No.

28:22.802 --> 28:25.104
I just wanted her to like me.

28:25.137 --> 28:27.907
And she needed to
solve her case.

28:27.940 --> 28:29.475
- So Detective Rollins
encouraged you

28:29.508 --> 28:31.010
to see Sean Roberts,

28:31.043 --> 28:33.212
then you made her happy
by saying you had seen him

28:33.245 --> 28:35.014
at 1:15 exactly?

28:35.047 --> 28:37.316
- That's a good way
of saying it.

28:37.349 --> 28:38.985
- [scoffs]

28:39.018 --> 28:43.489
*

28:43.522 --> 28:45.491
Nothing further.

28:56.402 --> 28:57.369
- We got a guy on trial
who was wrongfully convicted

28:58.004 --> 28:58.871
on bad eyewitness testimony,

28:58.905 --> 29:01.207
and you don't tell me
that the kid waffled

29:01.240 --> 29:02.341
on the ID or the time.

29:02.374 --> 29:03.475
- He waffled.
He did not lie.

29:03.509 --> 29:05.044
There is a big difference.

29:05.077 --> 29:06.178
- Now you're parsing
degrees of deceit.

29:06.212 --> 29:07.814
- Listen,
Buchanan is gonna turn this

29:07.847 --> 29:09.415
into you manipulating the kid

29:09.448 --> 29:10.416
to defend Fin.

29:10.449 --> 29:11.984
- Charlie's telling the truth.

29:12.018 --> 29:14.186
He saw Sean leave the house,

29:14.220 --> 29:16.823
toss the knife after he
and his girlfriend had sex,

29:16.856 --> 29:19.158
which was around 1:15 or so.
That's the truth.

29:19.191 --> 29:21.127
I can't help it if the kid
has a crush on me, or--

29:21.160 --> 29:22.228
- Hold on, so you were aware

29:22.261 --> 29:23.395
that he had an affection
for you--

29:23.429 --> 29:25.131
that he had a desire
to make you happy?

29:25.164 --> 29:26.365
- Lieutenant, listen.
I was there, all right?

29:26.398 --> 29:27.599
Rollins didn't lead him.

29:27.633 --> 29:29.468
- Don't make excuses for her.
That's not what the jury thinks.

29:29.501 --> 29:31.003
- Oh, come on.
You know what, Counselor?

29:31.037 --> 29:32.271
It's not Rollins's fault

29:32.304 --> 29:34.106
that Buchanan spun
that kid upside-down

29:34.140 --> 29:35.207
and you didn't know
how to stop him.

29:35.241 --> 29:37.009
- Okay, thank you.
We're done.

29:44.250 --> 29:46.085
- [sighs]

29:46.118 --> 29:47.286
- Okay.

29:47.319 --> 29:49.521
So where do we go
from here?

29:49.555 --> 29:52.091
- They're not gonna convict
on Charlie's testimony.

29:52.124 --> 29:54.126
Not anymore.

29:54.160 --> 29:56.562
We need to double down
on the physical evidence.

29:56.595 --> 29:59.498
- How do we do that?

30:03.102 --> 30:05.872
- I entered the defendant's
apartment with several officers

30:05.905 --> 30:07.406
and we began a search.

30:07.439 --> 30:08.607
I looked in the sink.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.376
I stuck a pencil in the drain

30:10.409 --> 30:12.178
and pulled out the diamond ring.

30:12.211 --> 30:13.312
- How many of
the police officers

30:13.345 --> 30:14.413
were present at that time?

30:14.446 --> 30:16.515
- At any given time, six to ten.

30:16.548 --> 30:17.549
- Okay.

30:17.583 --> 30:21.087
Detective Tutuola, um...

30:21.120 --> 30:22.421
how do you know
Sean Roberts?

30:22.454 --> 30:24.891
- I arrested him for rape
16 years ago.

30:24.924 --> 30:26.292
- He was found innocent
of that crime

30:26.325 --> 30:28.494
and released from prison
a month ago.

30:28.527 --> 30:30.129
Does that bother you?

30:30.162 --> 30:31.297
- Sure it does.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.432
But we went with
the evidence we had.

30:33.465 --> 30:35.167
- Do you have, um, any kind of--

30:35.201 --> 30:37.203
I don't know--grudge, vendetta

30:37.236 --> 30:38.570
against the defendant?

30:38.604 --> 30:39.906
- I do now he killed Ash.

30:39.939 --> 30:42.108
- Objection!
- Sustained.

30:42.141 --> 30:44.610
Please refrain from drawing
conclusions, Detective.

30:44.643 --> 30:45.878
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

30:45.912 --> 30:47.446
I mean, honestly,

30:47.479 --> 30:49.315
I have no grudges
against the man.

30:49.348 --> 30:50.917
If anything,
I was rooting for him

30:50.950 --> 30:53.152
when he got out.

30:53.185 --> 30:55.087
- Thank you.
Nothing further.

30:57.156 --> 30:59.458
- You must be embarrassed about
putting an innocent man

30:59.491 --> 31:01.360
in prison for 16 years.

31:01.393 --> 31:02.594
- I didn't put him there.

31:02.628 --> 31:04.196
I just arrested him.

31:04.230 --> 31:05.464
And no, I'm not embarrassed.

31:05.497 --> 31:06.632
I just did my job.

31:06.665 --> 31:07.466
- You say
you're not embarrassed,

31:07.499 --> 31:10.669
even though convicting
an innocent man

31:10.702 --> 31:14.106
obviously reflects poorly on you
as a police officer.

31:14.140 --> 31:15.607
Your job is to arrest
guilty people,

31:15.641 --> 31:16.642
not innocent ones.

31:16.675 --> 31:18.110
- That's correct.

31:18.144 --> 31:19.478
But it doesn't always
go that way.

31:19.511 --> 31:20.913
That's just the way it is.

31:20.947 --> 31:22.348
- Right.

31:22.381 --> 31:24.116
It's just the way it is.

31:24.150 --> 31:26.185
So given what's transpired,

31:26.218 --> 31:28.254
you'd obviously feel
better about yourself,

31:28.287 --> 31:30.622
your reputation,
the department's reputation,

31:30.656 --> 31:34.326
if Sean was found guilty
of this crime, right?

31:34.360 --> 31:35.627
It would be vindication.

31:35.661 --> 31:38.430
You've buried an innocent man,

31:38.464 --> 31:40.366
but that's no big deal,

31:40.399 --> 31:41.467
because he's a criminal.

31:41.500 --> 31:44.270
- And like I said before,
I did my job right then

31:44.303 --> 31:45.271
and now.

31:45.304 --> 31:46.505
- By doing your job right,

31:46.538 --> 31:49.475
do you mean framing
Sean Roberts again?

31:49.508 --> 31:51.978
- Objection!

31:52.011 --> 31:53.445
- Withdrawn.

31:53.479 --> 31:56.448
[tense music]

31:56.482 --> 31:59.485
*

32:00.987 --> 32:02.354
- How'd it go?

32:02.388 --> 32:04.423
- [sighs]
As well as it could have.

32:04.456 --> 32:07.293
Jury looks at a guy
who was put away innocent,

32:07.326 --> 32:08.294
they hesitate.

32:08.327 --> 32:09.361
- They should.

32:09.395 --> 32:10.529
- Not this time, Melanie.

32:10.562 --> 32:12.664
He's guilty.
There's no question about this.

32:12.698 --> 32:16.235
- No, but that's what
you said last time.

32:16.268 --> 32:18.237
None of us saw
what happened.

32:18.270 --> 32:19.438
I mean, if you really
think about it, I mean,

32:19.471 --> 32:21.240
we're all just--
we're just guessing.

32:21.273 --> 32:23.375
We're just filling
in the blanks and--

32:23.409 --> 32:24.610
and connecting the dots.

32:24.643 --> 32:27.246
- I found Ashley's
ring in his drain.

32:27.279 --> 32:28.547
How else could it
have gotten there?

32:28.580 --> 32:30.316
- According to Sean's lawyer--

32:30.349 --> 32:32.418
- I did not plant
that ring, okay?

32:32.451 --> 32:33.552
Why would I?

32:33.585 --> 32:36.355
Think about it.

32:36.388 --> 32:38.424
- I'm sorry, I'm just--

32:38.457 --> 32:40.392
I was just--
I was so sure last time,

32:40.426 --> 32:43.462
and then I was wrong,
and I just--

32:43.495 --> 32:46.332
I just can't trust myself.

32:46.365 --> 32:49.001
- Did you hear Sean and Ashley
speaking that night?

32:49.035 --> 32:51.003
Yes or no?

32:51.037 --> 32:53.239
*

32:53.272 --> 32:54.306
- I'm not sure now.

32:54.340 --> 32:55.541
- That's not
what you told me

32:55.574 --> 32:57.409
that night
at the crime scene.

32:57.443 --> 32:59.578
No one's asking you
to say if he's guilty.

32:59.611 --> 33:02.781
That's the jury's job,
not yours.

33:02.814 --> 33:06.052
- He already served 16 years.

33:06.085 --> 33:08.620
What if I'm wrong again?

33:08.654 --> 33:11.590
*

33:11.623 --> 33:12.724
- What do you mean,
she won't testify?

33:12.758 --> 33:15.594
- She told me she's not sure
she heard Sean's voice--

33:15.627 --> 33:17.263
not anymore.

33:17.296 --> 33:18.464
- What the hell did
you say to her?

33:18.497 --> 33:19.298
- You putting this on me?

33:19.331 --> 33:21.033
- You're the last person
she talked to.

33:21.067 --> 33:22.468
- Hold on.

33:22.501 --> 33:23.702
Fin was trying to help.

33:23.735 --> 33:26.738
It's not his fault
that she got cold feet.

33:26.772 --> 33:28.507
- I feel for her.
I really do.

33:28.540 --> 33:30.276
But she needs to testify.

33:30.309 --> 33:31.277
After the Charlie debacle,

33:31.310 --> 33:33.345
she's the only one who can
put Sean at the scene.

33:33.379 --> 33:34.346
- She won't cooperate.

33:34.380 --> 33:36.482
- Then I'll have to call her
as a hostile witness

33:36.515 --> 33:38.784
and compel her testimony.

33:38.817 --> 33:40.086
- [sighs]
- Look, guys.

33:40.119 --> 33:41.587
This isn't about Melanie.

33:41.620 --> 33:43.389
It's about her daughter.

33:43.422 --> 33:46.258
We need to get justice for her--

33:46.292 --> 33:49.261
with or without cooperation.

33:56.368 --> 33:57.169
- I told you,
I don't want to do this.

33:57.936 --> 33:59.271
- Permission to treat
the witness

33:59.305 --> 34:00.272
as hostile, Your Honor?

34:00.306 --> 34:01.173
- Permission granted.
Proceed.

34:01.207 --> 34:03.442
You must answer the questions,
Ms. Harper.

34:05.544 --> 34:09.081
- The night of your daughter's
rape and murder,

34:09.115 --> 34:11.183
you heard the defendant's
voice in your house.

34:11.217 --> 34:14.353
He was talking to Ashley
around midnight.

34:14.386 --> 34:15.687
He was talking to Ashley
around midnight--

34:15.721 --> 34:17.256
I can show you
the police report

34:17.289 --> 34:18.324
to help refresh your memory.

34:18.357 --> 34:19.358
- Okay, okay, yes.

34:19.391 --> 34:21.427
I...

34:21.460 --> 34:22.561
I heard Sean's voice.

34:22.594 --> 34:25.164
I...well, I thought
I did, anyway.

34:25.197 --> 34:26.265
I'm--I'm not sure now.

34:26.298 --> 34:29.401
- You were sure then--
sure enough to tell the police.

34:30.402 --> 34:33.305
- I don't think that Sean

34:33.339 --> 34:35.207
would kill Ashley.

34:35.241 --> 34:37.443
He cared about her.

34:37.476 --> 34:38.644
He had his whole future
ahead of him.

34:38.677 --> 34:40.546
- And yet you said
you heard his voice

34:40.579 --> 34:42.581
in your house the night
of the murder.

34:42.614 --> 34:43.682
- Well, yes, I said that, but--

34:43.715 --> 34:45.151
- But you didn't hear him leave,

34:45.184 --> 34:46.552
and you didn't hear
anyone else come in.

34:46.585 --> 34:49.555
- No, but that's what
I thought last time,

34:49.588 --> 34:52.458
and I was wrong.

34:52.491 --> 34:56.262
What I did to Sean
was unforgivable.

34:57.396 --> 34:59.165
I told the jury he did it.

34:59.198 --> 35:01.500
I pointed at him,
and I said,

35:01.533 --> 35:03.502
"That's the man who raped me."

35:03.535 --> 35:05.204
And I was wrong.

35:05.237 --> 35:06.705
- That's why you're hesitant
to identify him now--

35:06.738 --> 35:08.374
because if you were wrong then,

35:08.407 --> 35:09.608
you might be wrong again now.

35:09.641 --> 35:11.410
- If Sean was there,
then that would mean--

35:11.443 --> 35:12.478
- That means he killed her.

35:12.511 --> 35:13.479
Is that what you
were about to say?

35:13.512 --> 35:15.414
- Objection!
- Let me rephrase.

35:15.447 --> 35:18.284
Ms. Harper, you blame yourself

35:18.317 --> 35:20.152
for your daughter's death,
don't you?

35:20.186 --> 35:21.420
- Excuse me?

35:21.453 --> 35:25.224
- You caused Ashley's death.

35:25.257 --> 35:26.425
[tense music]

35:26.458 --> 35:28.560
You sent him to prison,

35:28.594 --> 35:31.363
where he was victimized
and abused for 16 years.

35:31.397 --> 35:34.666
Thanks to you, he learned how
to become a killer and a rapist.

35:34.700 --> 35:37.369
- Objection--is there
a question anywhere here?

35:37.403 --> 35:38.437
- Get to the point, Mr. Barba.

35:38.470 --> 35:40.372
- The point is, if you had not

35:40.406 --> 35:41.607
made that false identification

35:41.640 --> 35:43.342
16 years ago,

35:43.375 --> 35:45.177
he never would've
gone to prison,

35:45.211 --> 35:47.379
which means he never
would've killed Ashley.

35:47.413 --> 35:48.447
- That's not true.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.249
- That's not true, or you don't
want it to be true?

35:50.282 --> 35:51.550
Because, in your mind,

35:51.583 --> 35:53.252
if he killed Ashley,

35:53.285 --> 35:55.554
you killed her.

35:55.587 --> 35:57.789
And that's too
painful to accept.

35:57.823 --> 36:00.392
*

36:00.426 --> 36:03.395
That's why you don't
want to testify.

36:03.429 --> 36:10.436
*

36:12.771 --> 36:14.773
- [crying]

36:16.675 --> 36:18.644
I-I sent him there.

36:18.677 --> 36:21.380
*

36:21.413 --> 36:24.283
Every time he was

36:24.316 --> 36:27.753
beaten or raped,

36:27.786 --> 36:30.522
it was my fault.

36:30.556 --> 36:32.324
I turned him into a rapist--

36:32.358 --> 36:35.627
a monster.

36:35.661 --> 36:38.697
And it was my fault.

36:38.730 --> 36:41.700
I'm the--
I'm the guilty one here.

36:41.733 --> 36:46.505
*

36:46.538 --> 36:49.608
- To feel this guilty,

36:49.641 --> 36:53.712
you obviously believe
he killed your daughter.

36:53.745 --> 36:56.315
Which means you are certain

36:56.348 --> 36:58.317
you heard Sean's voice
in your house

36:58.350 --> 37:01.019
the night of the murder,
around midnight.

37:01.052 --> 37:03.322
Correct?

37:03.355 --> 37:08.327
*

37:08.360 --> 37:10.329
- Yes.

37:10.362 --> 37:17.436
*

37:29.348 --> 37:32.484
- Unpleasant and tragic,
but well done.

37:32.518 --> 37:35.754
- Let's hope the jury
thinks so, too.

37:35.787 --> 37:38.657
- Looks like Buchanan
got the message.

37:39.658 --> 37:40.626
- Mr. Barba?

37:40.659 --> 37:41.727
- Mm-hmm?

37:41.760 --> 37:43.862
- I am open to
discussing a plea.

37:43.895 --> 37:45.864
- It's too late.

37:45.897 --> 37:48.900
- We'll plead guilty
to manslaughter.

37:48.934 --> 37:51.570
- He serves five years

37:51.603 --> 37:52.871
for a brutal rape and murder?

37:52.904 --> 37:53.872
Don't waste my time.

37:53.905 --> 37:55.741
- Wasted time?

37:55.774 --> 37:57.509
Ask Sean about that.

37:57.543 --> 37:58.777
16 years of it.

37:58.810 --> 38:01.480
If he serves five,
that's 21 years.

38:03.482 --> 38:06.485
You want to roll the dice
with the jury, go ahead.

38:09.921 --> 38:11.857
- Murder two.

38:11.890 --> 38:15.727
He serves a minimum of 15 years.

38:15.761 --> 38:19.097
- Done.
- And he allocutes.

38:19.130 --> 38:23.402
Everybody needs to know that
we got it right this time.

38:23.435 --> 38:26.405
[somber music]

38:26.438 --> 38:30.476
*

38:30.509 --> 38:32.544
- Sean Roberts,
your lawyer tells me

38:32.578 --> 38:33.812
you'd like to plead guilty.

38:33.845 --> 38:36.782
Is that correct?

38:36.815 --> 38:37.916
- Yes, Your Honor.

38:37.949 --> 38:39.685
- Do you make this
plea knowingly

38:39.718 --> 38:41.687
and voluntarily?

38:41.720 --> 38:43.789
*

38:43.822 --> 38:44.790
- I do.

38:44.823 --> 38:45.891
- Has anyone induced you

38:45.924 --> 38:47.759
or coerced you in any way

38:47.793 --> 38:50.462
into pleading guilty?

38:50.496 --> 38:51.497
- No, Your Honor.

38:51.530 --> 38:56.134
- I understand you'd
like to make a statement.

38:56.167 --> 38:58.136
Proceed.

38:58.169 --> 39:04.976
*

39:05.010 --> 39:06.745
- Melanie...

39:09.915 --> 39:12.884
I'm so, so sorry.

39:12.918 --> 39:14.453
*

39:14.486 --> 39:17.689
I know how much
you loved Ashley.

39:17.723 --> 39:19.558
*

39:19.591 --> 39:22.428
But I cared about her, too.

39:22.461 --> 39:24.730
*

39:24.763 --> 39:27.999
She gave me hope
I could start over.

39:28.033 --> 39:29.935
She wasn't afraid

39:29.968 --> 39:32.638
to be alone with me.

39:32.671 --> 39:34.740
She didn't look at me
like I was dirt,

39:34.773 --> 39:38.477
like everyone else.

39:38.510 --> 39:41.747
Then that night, I was drunk.

39:41.780 --> 39:43.615
*

39:43.649 --> 39:45.517
I wasn't used to that.

39:45.551 --> 39:48.420
I went over there
to talk to her,

39:48.454 --> 39:50.422
to say I was sorry

39:50.456 --> 39:52.858
for how I acted at dinner.

39:52.891 --> 39:54.593
*

39:54.626 --> 39:58.597
And I told her how much
I liked her...

39:58.630 --> 40:02.868
*

40:02.901 --> 40:05.871
And she just sort of laughed.

40:05.904 --> 40:10.609
*

40:10.642 --> 40:12.611
And that was it.

40:12.644 --> 40:15.814
- [crying softly]

40:15.847 --> 40:19.217
- You can't let people
laugh at you.

40:19.250 --> 40:23.489
16 years, that's what I learned.

40:23.522 --> 40:26.925
Things happened to me
in prison...

40:26.958 --> 40:30.028
things I swore
I'd never do to anyone else--

40:30.061 --> 40:32.498
I ended up doing to Ashley.

40:32.531 --> 40:36.568
I didn't want to do it.

40:36.602 --> 40:38.670
It just happened.

40:38.704 --> 40:45.711
*

40:55.887 --> 40:57.455
- Melanie.

41:00.759 --> 41:03.729
I'm sorry.

41:03.762 --> 41:04.996
- I know.

41:09.067 --> 41:13.972
At least I know
he did it this time.

41:14.005 --> 41:17.543
- It's not your fault.

41:17.576 --> 41:20.712
- Then whose is it?

41:20.746 --> 41:27.753
*

41:40.599 --> 41:41.833
- How are you?

41:41.867 --> 41:44.035
- I'm good.

41:44.069 --> 41:47.639
Bad guy went down.
That's all that matters.

41:48.907 --> 41:51.877
- Well, if you ever
feel like talking...

41:51.910 --> 41:54.045
- Talking's overrated.

41:56.047 --> 41:59.618
- Justice sure isn't
pretty some days.

41:59.651 --> 42:02.921
- Damn ugly this time.

42:02.954 --> 42:06.658
*
