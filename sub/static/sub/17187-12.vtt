34:02.124 --> 34:03.874
Like those machines?

34:04.042 --> 34:07.628
Yeah. Yeah, like them.

34:07.921 --> 34:11.382
And in the future, you know my baby.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.759
So does that mean she makes it?

34:16.138 --> 34:20.307
Your daughter Sydney
has an immunity in her blood.

34:20.475 --> 34:22.935
She helps us cure a deadly disease.

34:24.438 --> 34:26.981
She saves a lot of lives.

"Either the wallpaper goes, or I do."

38:41.069 --> 38:43.487
I thought it'd be over by now.

You're ready for it.

No.

38:51.538 --> 38:53.288
No, I'm not.

38:53.540 --> 38:57.167
Then what were you doing
when I found you outside Eagle Rock?

Thank you for saving my sister.

I've been where you are.

There are days when you don't think
you can go on, but you will...

40:07.655 --> 40:10.074

there's more, aren't there?

everything was gonna be different?
