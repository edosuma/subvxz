Everyone remembers
their first job.

02:39.909 --> 02:41.910
This is the story of mine.

02:42.078 --> 02:46.248
I was the youngest
in a family of overachievers.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.542
My father was a world-famous
art historian,

02:48.710 --> 02:51.295
and my brother was ahead
of me in everything.

02:51.462 --> 02:53.881
I was always the disappointment.

02:54.048 --> 02:58.093
I found my solace in the small cinema
I went to every Thursday night.

02:58.261 --> 03:02.222
Alfred Hitchcock. Orson Welles.
Laurence Olivier.

03:02.390 --> 03:04.224
These were my heroes.

03:04.392 --> 03:06.602
I wanted to be a part of their world.

03:07.770 --> 03:10.898
When I was 23, I got my chance.

03:11.065 --> 03:13.275
Colin, come in.
Have you met James and Anna,

03:13.443 --> 03:15.777
- my two very brilliant pupils?
- Hello.

03:15.945 --> 03:18.906
- I'm off to London now, Pa.
- Your silly job interview.

03:19.073 --> 03:21.116
Well, bonne chance, dear boy.

03:21.284 --> 03:23.994
I can always get you
a research position at the V&A

03:24.162 --> 03:28.457
once you've grown up a bit and got this
film idea out of your system.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.375
- So I'm off now, Ma.
- Off?

03:30.543 --> 03:34.087
- My job interview, Mother.
- Oh! Can't you stay for dinner?

03:34.255 --> 03:36.215
There's nothing to eat, but I'm sure
the conversation will be charming.

03:36.382 --> 03:37.341
I don't want to be late in the morning.

03:37.508 --> 03:40.928
I'm sure they won't mind. You'll be
a famous film director in no time.

03:42.388 --> 03:46.767
I had everything to prove to my
family, but more to prove to myself.

03:47.852 --> 03:50.437
Like every young man,
I had to make my own way.

03:52.315 --> 03:54.942
So I decided to leave home

03:55.109 --> 03:57.152
and join the circus.

03:57.320 --> 04:00.614
- What do you want?
- A job on your next film.

04:00.782 --> 04:02.199
You're an actor, aren't you?

04:02.367 --> 04:03.951
No, I want to work
on the production side.

04:04.118 --> 04:06.328
We don't start shooting
for another eight weeks.

04:06.496 --> 04:09.998
- Come back nearer the time.
- May I wait until there's a job?

04:22.220 --> 04:23.345
Vanessa!

04:24.681 --> 04:25.722
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.

04:28.559 --> 04:30.269
There are no jobs.

04:30.436 --> 04:32.187
I'll come back tomorrow
morning just in case.

04:32.355 --> 04:34.356
It's a free country.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.783
- Good morning.
- You're very determined.

04:44.951 --> 04:47.661
Well, I'd do anything
to be in the film business.

04:47.829 --> 04:50.330
- Anything?

04:50.498 --> 04:51.832
Sir Laurence Olivier Productions.

04:52.750 --> 04:54.668
No, I'm afraid he's at Notley
till the end of the week.

04:56.879 --> 04:58.880
- Vanessa asked me to...
- Oh, did she?

04:59.674 --> 05:03.510
I need a number for Noel Coward.
It won't be in the book.

05:18.234 --> 05:19.484
- Hello, Vivien.
- Hello.

05:19.652 --> 05:20.736
- Sir Laurence.
- Hughie!

05:20.903 --> 05:23.071
Simply impossible to get Marilyn Monroe
on the telephone.

05:23.239 --> 05:26.325
The darling girl spends
the entire day asleep.

05:26.492 --> 05:28.744
- Hello, boy. Remind me.
- Darling, you remember Colin.

05:28.911 --> 05:32.831
- You met him at the Clark's party.
- Of course. What are you doing here?

05:32.999 --> 05:34.583
You said there might be a job
on your film.

05:34.751 --> 05:37.502
Have a cigarette.
Keep the pack.

05:37.670 --> 05:38.920
Thank you, sir.

05:39.088 --> 05:43.258
There won't be a film unless Miss Monroe
gets her splendid posterior out of bed.

05:43.426 --> 05:45.719
The house committee is threatening
to withhold Miller's passport.

05:45.887 --> 05:47.763
They say he's a communist.
No Arthur, no Marilyn.

05:47.930 --> 05:49.473
I'll have a word with
the American ambassador.

05:49.640 --> 05:53.226
I'm taking him to see Vivien's play on
Thursday. Terry's rewrites, are they in?

05:53.394 --> 05:55.520
Not all of them, of course.
When did that ever happen?

05:55.688 --> 05:59.691
He's the first actor since du Maurier
to have his own brand.

05:59.859 --> 06:03.528
They pay him an absolute fortune.
I'm afraid they're rather ghastly.

06:03.696 --> 06:06.448
Isn't he gorgeous, Vanessa?

06:06.616 --> 06:08.283
I suppose he's all right.

06:08.451 --> 06:13.038
Darling, you must do something for
Colin. You absolutely promised.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.248
Hughie, let's try to
find him something to do.

06:15.416 --> 06:16.625
- Yes. Of course.
- Come on, darling.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.460
You'll look after my precious
Larrykins, won't you?

06:18.628 --> 06:21.713
- Come on, darling.
- Christ.

06:21.881 --> 06:23.215
Do you like it?

06:23.383 --> 06:24.758
That's absolutely splendid.

06:24.926 --> 06:27.469
- You were absolutely born for it.
- Door.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.429
Sorry.

06:29.597 --> 06:32.015
And could you turn
all the way around, my darling?

06:32.183 --> 06:35.185
- Thank you.
- This is the dress Larry likes.

06:35.353 --> 06:37.687
- There?
- The camera's ravishing you.

06:37.855 --> 06:39.648
Oh, dear. That sounds serious.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.942
- That's wonderful.
- Too much?

06:42.110 --> 06:44.486
- Oh, God. Not for me.
- Arthur Jacobs,

06:44.654 --> 06:46.154
Miss Monroe's publicist,
is flying in tomorrow.

06:46.322 --> 06:48.281
He wants to see the house
where she'll be staying.

06:48.449 --> 06:50.075
Find something suitable.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.160
- Yes, sir.
- More importantly,

06:52.328 --> 06:55.622
- how does it make you feel?
- And leave the bloody tea.

06:55.790 --> 06:58.166
Oh. Sorry.

06:59.293 --> 07:03.547
Out of the question. I can't have
a lot of awful film people traveling

07:03.714 --> 07:05.382
- through the house in dirty boots.
- But we'd be paying

07:05.550 --> 07:07.676
a hundred pounds per week
for 18 weeks.

07:07.844 --> 07:10.178
- My wife would never agree.
- That's a pity, Mr. Cotes-Preedy.

07:10.346 --> 07:12.681
I'll have to tell Miss Monroe
to look elsewhere, then.

07:12.849 --> 07:16.268
- Marilyn Monroe?
- Yes.

07:16.436 --> 07:20.063
Suppose I'd have to be introduced.

07:23.151 --> 07:27.988
Good morning, Mr. Jacobs.
Hope you had a pleasant flight.

07:30.074 --> 07:32.325
ls this the fucking car?

07:40.001 --> 07:42.711
Who built this place?
Hansel and Gretel?

07:42.879 --> 07:44.880
It's one of the best houses
in the area.

07:45.047 --> 07:46.965
All right. We'll take it.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.718
But ditch the wallpaper.
It's giving me a migraine.

07:52.805 --> 07:55.015
That house was perfect for Marilyn.

07:55.183 --> 07:57.184
- Can't use it now.
- Yes, we can.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.562
I knew that Cotes-Preedy
wouldn't be able to keep this quiet,

08:00.730 --> 08:02.772
so that's why when you asked me
to find a house for Miss Monroe,

08:02.940 --> 08:04.357
I took the precaution of finding two.

08:04.525 --> 08:07.235
So the other one, Parkside,
is much better.

08:07.403 --> 08:08.904
And the owner is very discreet.

08:09.071 --> 08:11.907
So we've got two expensive houses now
where we only needed one.

08:12.074 --> 08:14.743
I thought that someone else
on the production might want it.

08:14.911 --> 08:16.161
Oh, did you?

08:16.329 --> 08:18.413
I guess Milton could use it

08:18.581 --> 08:20.916
and it's near the studio. Near Marilyn.

08:21.083 --> 08:24.920
What are we paying you, boy?

08:25.087 --> 08:28.548
- Nothing, sir.
- Let's see to it, Hughie.

08:28.716 --> 08:30.217
Well done, boy.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.428
Nice job, kid.

08:37.225 --> 08:39.434
Colin Clark,
Laurence Olivier Productions.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.900
The film was then
called The Sleeping Prince.

08:47.777 --> 08:51.029
Marilyn was to play a naive American
showgirl called Elsie Marina

08:51.197 --> 08:55.450
who is seduced by an Eastern-European
prince played by Olivier.

08:55.618 --> 08:57.536
It was the lightest of comedies.

09:01.582 --> 09:04.042
- You in the union?
- No.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.835
Then you can't have a job on the film.

09:06.003 --> 09:07.546
Well, how do I get into the union?

09:07.713 --> 09:09.256
By getting a job on the film.

09:09.423 --> 09:12.008
It's called a closed shop.

09:14.053 --> 09:15.554
I suppose I might be able
to do something for you.

09:15.721 --> 09:19.474
The union owe me a few favors.
We don't have a third yet.

09:19.642 --> 09:24.312
- A third?
- Third assistant director.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.816
- You do know what the job is?
- Assisting the director?

09:27.984 --> 09:29.985
That's the last thing you do!

09:30.152 --> 09:33.863
Lesson one: third's job is to
do whatever the fuck I tell him.

09:34.448 --> 09:37.325
And what are you waiting for?

09:41.372 --> 09:42.622
Colin!

09:42.790 --> 09:45.292
Lesson two: don't shit
on your own doorstep.

09:45.459 --> 09:46.293
- Got it?
- Got it.

09:46.460 --> 09:50.463
Lesson three:
The third always stays nearby.

09:50.631 --> 09:52.757
Not in some bloody palace in London.

09:52.925 --> 09:55.093
Book a room at
The Dog & Duck down the road.

09:55.261 --> 09:57.804
It's a bit rough. You'll get used to it.

09:57.972 --> 10:01.391
Now make yourself useful.
Marilyn needs a bodyguard.

10:01.559 --> 10:03.893
Sort something out.

10:04.395 --> 10:07.439
I'm sure you understand the sensitive
nature of the job, Superintendent.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.025
Something about looking
after a cinema actress?

10:10.192 --> 10:13.028
Well, not just any actress.
Marilyn Monroe.

10:13.195 --> 10:15.488
I never had much time
for the pictures.

10:15.656 --> 10:16.865
Excellent.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.034
For the next four months,

10:19.201 --> 10:22.037
you never leave her side.
Day or night.

10:22.204 --> 10:25.248
Her behavior is reputedly
a little erratic.

10:25.416 --> 10:27.751
- She drinks?
- Amongst other things.

10:27.918 --> 10:30.629
- Pills?
- It would be useful if you could, uh,

10:30.796 --> 10:33.048
keep us informed of
her domestic situation.

10:33.215 --> 10:34.132
You want me to spy on her.

10:34.300 --> 10:37.552
Well, the odd early warning
if you know she's going to be late.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.387
That kind of thing.

10:48.356 --> 10:49.564
Hello.

10:49.732 --> 10:52.233
Colin Clark. I booked a room.

10:52.401 --> 10:54.986
Ah, right. Here you are.

10:55.154 --> 10:56.863
Sign this.

10:58.532 --> 11:00.241
What brings you up this way?

11:00.409 --> 11:02.035
I'm working on a film at Pinewood.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.787
Oh. What film is that?

11:03.954 --> 11:07.415
It's called The Sleeping Prince. With
Sir Laurence Olivier and Marilyn Monroe,

11:07.583 --> 11:10.752
so I'll be working with them.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.837
Room's three quid a week.
First week in advance.

11:13.005 --> 11:14.631
Number two.

11:14.799 --> 11:19.511
And, uh, hope you don't mind,
you'll be sharing with Grace Kelly.

11:35.778 --> 11:39.948
This'll work fine for Marilyn. Oh, and,
uh, Paula will need the room next door.

11:40.116 --> 11:42.117
- I beg your pardon?
- Sorry, who is Paula?

11:42.284 --> 11:44.869
Strasberg. Marilyn's acting coach.

11:45.037 --> 11:46.538
She's nuts about the Method.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.957
Arthur, we've spoken about this before.

11:49.125 --> 11:52.168
Stanislavski and the Method are
perfectly fine in the rehearsal room,

11:52.336 --> 11:54.462
but they don't belong on a film set.

11:54.630 --> 11:55.922
Time is too tight.

11:59.301 --> 12:01.553
Larry! Some good news.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.972
House committee have decided
Miller isn't a communist after all.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.390
Of course he is.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.643
All those pain in the ass
New York intellectuals are Reds.

12:08.811 --> 12:11.813
Which means she'll be flying
in next week on schedule.

12:11.981 --> 12:14.315
- Excellent news.
- She'll have to be met.

12:14.483 --> 12:16.484
Well, naturally Vivien and l
will be there to greet her,

12:16.652 --> 12:19.070
but let's keep it low key, shall we?

12:19.238 --> 12:21.489
You join us here at London Airport,

12:21.657 --> 12:24.117
where it is absolute mayhem.

12:32.626 --> 12:34.502
Marilyn! This way! Get out of the way!

12:48.934 --> 12:52.353
With her is her new husband,
America's most celebrated playwright

12:52.521 --> 12:55.023
and author of Death of a Salesman,
Arthur Miller.

12:57.860 --> 12:59.861
Beautiful. You're looking at
tomorrow's front page, boys.

13:00.029 --> 13:02.030
- We'll have to get them into the hall.
- Sir Laurence Olivier

13:02.198 --> 13:05.658
and Scarlett O'Hara herself,
Vivien Leigh, are set to greet them.

13:05.826 --> 13:09.287
American acting royalty
meeting British acting royalty.

13:10.247 --> 13:13.041
Gentlemen, it is my especial pleasure

13:13.209 --> 13:17.212
to introduce a woman
who clearly needs no introduction.

13:17.379 --> 13:19.547
Marilyn! How do you like being married?

13:20.049 --> 13:21.883
Well, I like it. I like it a lot.

13:22.051 --> 13:24.385
- ls this third time lucky?
- You bet it is.

13:24.553 --> 13:27.055
ls it true you want to be
a classical actress now?

13:27.223 --> 13:29.140
Well, I want to be
the best actress I can be.

13:29.308 --> 13:32.060
There's a rumor you're going to be in
The Brothers Karamazov, on Broadway.

13:32.228 --> 13:36.189
Ooh.
I'm... considering it.

13:36.357 --> 13:37.565
Which of them will you be playing?

13:37.733 --> 13:39.317
I'll be playing Grushenka.

13:39.485 --> 13:42.487
- Can you spell that?
- Sure. Can you?

13:44.657 --> 13:47.826
Vivien, you created
the role of Elsie on stage.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.911
Have you any advice for Marilyn?

13:50.079 --> 13:52.330
I am sure if Miss Monroe
needs any advice,

13:52.498 --> 13:54.415
she'll get it from her director.

13:54.583 --> 13:57.377
I hear he's terribly good.

13:57.545 --> 13:58.795
Marilyn!

14:01.090 --> 14:03.132
Are you happy with your last film?

14:03.300 --> 14:05.385
Marilyn!

14:05.553 --> 14:08.429
ls it true you wear nothing
in bed except perfume?

14:08.597 --> 14:09.556
Ooh.

14:09.723 --> 14:13.518
Darling, as I'm in England, let's say l
sleep in nothing but Yardley's Lavender.

14:29.034 --> 14:30.326
Smile, Marilyn!

14:34.623 --> 14:36.958
OK, let's get a snap of the newlyweds.

14:37.126 --> 14:39.794
Smile, Arthur. It's not a firing squad.

14:41.589 --> 14:42.797
This is some place you found.

14:42.965 --> 14:45.133
You have my new assistant
Colin to thank for that.

14:45.301 --> 14:48.136
Colin, this is Milton Greene.
You must be very nice to him.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.805
He owns half of
Marilyn Monroe Productions.

14:50.973 --> 14:52.974
- Forty-nine percent, Larry.
- Have a cigarette.

14:53.142 --> 14:54.934
- I don't smoke.
- Really?

14:55.102 --> 14:58.688
- And the studio, they want a new title.
- Nonsense.

14:58.939 --> 15:01.608
Thank you very much.

15:05.487 --> 15:08.156
Marvelous, isn't she?

15:08.324 --> 15:10.992
- She's all right.
- Larry fell desperately

15:11.160 --> 15:13.786
in love with her in New York.
He's determined to seduce her.

15:13.954 --> 15:16.080
Yeah, but she's only
been married three weeks.

15:16.248 --> 15:18.666
I thought you were a man of the world.

15:18.834 --> 15:20.543
Of course, Larry would never leave me,

15:20.711 --> 15:23.379
but if anything were to happen
you would tell me, wouldn't you?

15:24.590 --> 15:28.009
- I'm sure he loves you very much.
- Oh, don't be such a boy.

15:28.177 --> 15:30.470
I'm 43, darling.

15:31.597 --> 15:36.184
No one will love me for very much
longer. Not even you.

15:52.201 --> 15:54.911
What a wonderful adventure,
Dame Sybil.

15:55.079 --> 15:56.537
Such a lark.

15:56.705 --> 15:59.040
I long to see her.

16:15.891 --> 16:18.726
Miss Monroe?

16:19.895 --> 16:22.563
Sir Laurence sends his compliments.
He's ready for the read-through.

16:22.731 --> 16:24.440
But Marilyn is not ready.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.985
She's preparing.

16:28.404 --> 16:30.738
Excuse my horrible face.

16:36.578 --> 16:38.287
Ah! Marilyn, my dear.

16:39.540 --> 16:42.458
Everyone is so excited to meet you.

16:42.626 --> 16:44.794
Do... Come along, my darling, my angel.

16:45.921 --> 16:48.423
Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss Marilyn Monroe.

16:48.590 --> 16:51.259
- Marilyn.
- How lovely you are.

16:51.427 --> 16:54.637
- Here, I kept a place for you.
- I have to be next to Marilyn.

16:54.805 --> 16:57.265
What a good idea.
I wish we could all bring a friend.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.726
One does get so terribly nervous.

16:59.893 --> 17:02.186
It's just like the first day
at school, isn't it?

17:02.354 --> 17:05.189
So, welcome, dear Marilyn,

17:05.357 --> 17:08.693
to our little fraternity.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.112
We may seem a little strange

17:11.280 --> 17:14.615
and, uh, quaint to you at first,

17:14.783 --> 17:16.659
but I hope that in time,

17:16.827 --> 17:20.872
you may come to find your
method in our madness.

17:22.541 --> 17:24.375
So, my very noble
and approved good masters,

17:24.543 --> 17:27.462
may we strive to create a work of art

17:27.629 --> 17:30.757
that, led by your good graces,

17:30.924 --> 17:32.925
will be cherished

17:33.093 --> 17:36.637
as long as motion pictures

17:38.223 --> 17:39.474
may be remembered.

17:43.645 --> 17:46.230
Were you surprised
to get my invitation?

17:47.149 --> 17:48.900
I'll say l was surprised.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.277
I was so surprised, I couldn't
hardly think you meant me.

17:51.445 --> 17:53.196
Oh, but of course I meant you.

17:53.363 --> 17:56.324
I had your name most carefully
marked down in my program.

17:56.492 --> 17:58.910
In matters of this kind,
I assure you I'm most methodical.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.454
Who would you think I meant if not you?

18:02.581 --> 18:05.500
Gee, Mr. Sir, I could just
listen to your accent all day.

18:05.667 --> 18:08.377
Oh, you darling, Marilyn.

18:08.545 --> 18:10.129
You're amongst friends now.

18:10.297 --> 18:12.632
Just plain "Larry" will suffice, really.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.468
That's so sweet.
Um, whenever you're ready.

18:15.636 --> 18:17.553
Well, Maisie Springfield.

18:17.721 --> 18:19.806
No, not Maisie Springfield.

18:19.973 --> 18:22.850
She is quite what
I would call "old hat."

18:23.018 --> 18:25.269
Remember why you're
in the embassy, Marilyn.

18:25.437 --> 18:28.147
What does the Grand Duke
want from Elsie?

18:28.315 --> 18:31.317
You came here and you thought...

18:31.485 --> 18:33.402
...from experience, Marilyn.

18:33.570 --> 18:35.655
It's only a read-through, Paula.

18:35.823 --> 18:39.700
Marilyn has to begin
finding the character.

18:39.868 --> 18:41.619
Oh, the character's on the page.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.997
The words, maybe. Not the character.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.376
Aren't we going to have fun?

18:50.629 --> 18:53.464
Well, we'll pick it up
whenever you like.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.758
- We should talk. Just us.
- Yeah.

18:55.926 --> 18:57.051
Thank you so much.

18:58.554 --> 19:00.138
We can't have two fucking directors!

19:00.305 --> 19:02.557
- Marilyn wants Paula.
- Why? She's got me.

19:02.724 --> 19:04.809
Paula's costing us two and a half
thousand bucks a week.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.895
We might as well use her.
Listen, Larry.

19:08.063 --> 19:10.690
Accept Marilyn on her
own terms and you'll be OK.

19:10.858 --> 19:12.567
Try to change her
and she will drive you crazy.

19:12.734 --> 19:16.070
- Trust me.
- Christ, what have I got myself into?

19:17.531 --> 19:19.240
- Come out with me tonight.
- I'm working.

19:19.408 --> 19:21.576
- Well, tomorrow night, then.
- I'm washing my hair.

19:21.743 --> 19:24.912
- But your hair's lovely.
- Look, I've got two rules.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.581
Everyone has a lot of rules around here.

19:26.748 --> 19:28.916
One, never touch the talent,

19:29.084 --> 19:31.711
and two, never go out with thirds.

19:31.879 --> 19:33.045
Why not?

19:33.213 --> 19:36.299
Because they're all randy little buggers
who just want some fun during shooting.

19:36.466 --> 19:37.466
I'm not like that.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.387
Really.

19:43.515 --> 19:44.891
I'm free on Saturday.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.185
Colin!

19:49.021 --> 19:52.190
Quiet on set, everyone!

19:55.319 --> 19:58.529
How kind of you to meet us.
Dear me, you do look cold.

19:58.697 --> 20:00.239
They're ready for you
in makeup, Dame Sybil.

20:00.407 --> 20:03.326
How exciting. Don't you love
the first day of a new production?

20:03.493 --> 20:05.745
I don't know, Dame Sybil.
I've never had one before.

20:05.913 --> 20:08.623
Oh, to be young again.

20:15.839 --> 20:17.798
She has kept Dame Sybil Thorndike

20:17.966 --> 20:20.051
and the entire company
waiting in full costume

20:20.219 --> 20:24.388
for two hours, Mr. Orton,
and it is simply not fair.

20:44.451 --> 20:46.619
I can't do this.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.626
- What's wrong?
- She's nervous.

20:53.794 --> 20:55.544
I'll deal with it.

21:00.008 --> 21:01.509
Would you like to sit down,
Dame Sybil?

21:01.677 --> 21:03.427
Oh, yes. Colin, how kind.

21:03.595 --> 21:06.931
- Why don't we all sit down.
- Oi!

21:07.099 --> 21:08.391
That chair is a prop.

21:08.558 --> 21:09.850
- Props are NATKE.
- But I was...

21:10.018 --> 21:13.688
If ACTT members are gonna start doing
NATKE jobs, I'm calling my men out!

21:13.855 --> 21:14.855
- He's right.
- Right.

21:15.023 --> 21:16.774
I'm sure we're all good
union members here.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.734
There's no need to fall out
over something so trivial.

21:18.902 --> 21:22.989
It might be trivial to you,
Dame Sybil, but it's my livelihood!

21:23.156 --> 21:26.117
Put the chair down. Now!

21:26.910 --> 21:29.245
I rather think you've made your point.

21:29.413 --> 21:32.081
Solidarity is the most
important thing here.

21:32.249 --> 21:35.084
When unions fall out,
it's management that benefits.

21:37.087 --> 21:38.921
If I see you doing a NATKE job again,

21:39.089 --> 21:41.674
I will close this set down
quicker than you can blink.

21:41.842 --> 21:43.467
- Dave!
- Yes?

21:43.635 --> 21:45.011
Dame Sybil would like a chair.

21:45.178 --> 21:47.888
Right. There you are.

21:49.224 --> 21:51.851
I was on the picket lines
in 1926, you know.

21:52.019 --> 21:55.646
Now that really was a strike.
We were all Bolsheviks then.

22:00.861 --> 22:03.112
Ready. Camera running.

22:04.614 --> 22:07.241
- Very quiet, everyone.
- Speed.

22:07.409 --> 22:08.409
Five, take one.

22:08.744 --> 22:09.660
Action.

22:09.828 --> 22:11.495
Now, before you meet
my mother-in-law,

22:11.663 --> 22:16.083
I must remind you she's a little vague
and can be very deaf on occasion.

22:16.251 --> 22:18.544
My dear, such boredom.

22:18.712 --> 22:22.089
The decorations hideous
and the music catastrophe.

22:22.257 --> 22:24.467
Our friend, the ex-king
of Moravia, drove me home.

22:24.634 --> 22:26.344
He's now called the Duke of Strelitz.

22:26.511 --> 22:28.137
He cannot, of course,
go to the abbey tomorrow,

22:28.305 --> 22:30.222
but he's most anxious you
should invite him to the room

22:30.390 --> 22:32.099
you have taken at the Ritz for Nicky.

22:32.267 --> 22:33.893
- Maud?
- Yes, ma'am?

22:34.061 --> 22:37.772
There you are. I didn't see you. Give me
a glass of champagne I see over there.

22:37.939 --> 22:41.692
- Olga Bosnia...
- Might I present Miss Elsie Marina?

22:41.860 --> 22:44.820
Yes, my dear, of course.
I remember you well.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.790
- Gee, I forgot my line.
- That's a cut.

22:55.957 --> 22:58.584
- I'm sorry.
- It's so easily done, isn't it?

22:58.752 --> 23:00.628
I'm sure I went wrong somewhere there.

23:00.796 --> 23:02.213
- Shall we have another go, Larry?
- Of course.

23:02.381 --> 23:03.297
Action.

23:03.465 --> 23:05.424
Yes, my dear, of course.

23:05.592 --> 23:08.260
- I remember you well.
- Oh, I'm quite sure you don't,

23:08.428 --> 23:10.221
Your Royal...

23:10.389 --> 23:13.015
I mean Your, uh, Imperial, uh...

23:14.810 --> 23:17.311
- ...Serene Majesty?
- What does she say?

23:17.479 --> 23:21.399
She says she's flattered and compliments
you on your wonderful memory.

23:21.566 --> 23:23.234
I'm in The Coconut Girl at the Avenue.

23:25.362 --> 23:27.154
Didn't I have a line somewhere there?

23:27.322 --> 23:28.030
Cut.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.700
- Action.
- Sweetly pretty.

23:31.868 --> 23:33.702
She should use more mascara.

23:33.870 --> 23:36.122
When one is young,
one should use a lot of mascara.

23:36.289 --> 23:39.625
When one is old,
one should use much more.

23:39.793 --> 23:45.005
- What do you do, my dear?
- I'm in The Coconut Girl at the Avenue.

23:45.173 --> 23:47.258
- Dear?
- She says she's an actress.

23:50.512 --> 23:51.971
- Cut it there.
- Print.

23:54.182 --> 23:57.101
- Check the gate.
- Gate's good.

23:57.269 --> 23:58.978
That was perfect, Marilyn.

23:59.146 --> 24:01.480
You were Elsie to the life.

24:01.648 --> 24:04.984
I wonder, could we practice
our lines together later?

24:05.152 --> 24:07.319
You'd be doing me such a kindness.

24:07.487 --> 24:10.072
At my great age,
it's just so hard to make them stick.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.992
- Why don't you come for tea tomorrow.
- Can l?

24:13.160 --> 24:16.912
Sure.

24:19.040 --> 24:21.917
She's impossible.
I should've cast Vivien.

24:22.085 --> 24:26.005
If anyone can make her great,
it's you, sir.

24:26.173 --> 24:29.258
Well let's just hope I'm as
brilliant as you think I am.

24:29.426 --> 24:31.719
Now be a good boy
and keep an eye on her.

24:31.887 --> 24:32.887
Yes, sir.

24:33.388 --> 24:36.390
I can't
figure this stupid movie out.

24:36.558 --> 24:40.060
You were wonderful, Marilyn. The
most gifted actress I have ever known.

24:40.228 --> 24:42.730
- No.
- You were superb, Marilyn.

24:42.898 --> 24:45.983
You were divine.
Have faith in your talent.

24:46.151 --> 24:48.360
He was disappointed in me.

24:48.528 --> 24:50.154
You are a great, great actress.

24:50.322 --> 24:54.325
All my life, I have prayed for a great
actress I could help and guide.

24:55.994 --> 24:58.245
- Oh!
- Like this, I prayed to God,

24:58.413 --> 25:00.956
on my knees, and he has given me you.

25:01.124 --> 25:03.876
You are that great actress, Marilyn.

25:04.044 --> 25:05.920
Trust yourself.
Trust your talent.

25:06.087 --> 25:08.047
- Come on, Paula, get up.
- No.

25:08.215 --> 25:09.423
Not until you admit that you were great!

25:09.591 --> 25:11.091
Oh!

25:12.093 --> 25:13.385
- OK!
- Yes!

25:13.553 --> 25:16.388
- I guess I was.
- Of course you were.

25:16.556 --> 25:18.933
- There you are. Sorry.
- Thank you.

25:19.100 --> 25:21.268
You really were very good, Miss Monroe.

25:21.436 --> 25:23.521
Oh, thank you.

Are you sure you can afford all this?

25:51.258 --> 25:52.967
It's fine.

25:53.134 --> 25:54.760
Must be costing you a week's wages.

25:54.928 --> 25:56.220
You are worth it.

25:58.181 --> 25:59.640
You're not the average third, are you?

25:59.808 --> 26:01.559
I'm not living off my parents,
if that's what you mean.

26:01.726 --> 26:03.102
I want to make my own way.

26:03.270 --> 26:05.229
Will you be signing
on your father's account, sir?

26:05.397 --> 26:07.356
Um, no, I'm gonna pay cash.

26:07.524 --> 26:09.900
- Thank you.
- There you are, sir.

26:11.444 --> 26:12.778
I was always going to pay, you know.

Do you think Marilyn's beautiful?

26:22.581 --> 26:24.206
Not compared to you.

26:24.374 --> 26:26.292
You don't have to try so hard
to be charming.

26:26.459 --> 26:28.794
You're nice enough as it is.

26:29.713 --> 26:31.839
Well, you could be.

26:41.141 --> 26:43.183
Wait a while, crocodile.

26:43.351 --> 26:46.061
But I really do like you, Lucy.

26:46.229 --> 26:48.856
Maybe. That's my dad.

26:55.530 --> 26:58.907
Time to be thinking about bed,
darling. Early start tomorrow.

26:59.075 --> 27:00.743
Sorry, Daddy. We're just going
over tomorrow's schedule.

27:00.910 --> 27:02.745
Yes, I should be off, sir.

27:02.912 --> 27:05.539
Uh, Colin Clark. Lovely
to meet you, Mr. Armstrong.

27:05.707 --> 27:08.459
This is a great place you have here.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.711
Do you know this part of the world?

27:10.879 --> 27:13.130
Um, no. My family
are more country people.

27:13.298 --> 27:16.842
Oh. Well, good night.

27:17.010 --> 27:18.052
Good night.

27:24.476 --> 27:27.895
- Next Saturday?
- Yeah.

27:30.231 --> 27:32.232
- Good morning, Dame Sybil.
- Colin, dear.

27:32.400 --> 27:35.486
I thought you looked cold
so I bought you this.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.738
- Thank you, Dame Sybil.
- Film sets and rehearsal rooms

27:37.906 --> 27:40.240
are coldest places on Earth.

27:45.205 --> 27:47.289
She should be on time
like everyone else.

27:47.457 --> 27:50.167
- She's a star.
- I'm a fucking star.

27:50.335 --> 27:51.627
She's the greatest
piece of ass on Earth.

27:51.795 --> 27:54.254
With tits like that,
you make allowances.

27:54.422 --> 27:56.382
Marilyn, my darling,

27:56.549 --> 27:58.175
you are an angel
and I kiss the hem of your garment,

27:58.343 --> 28:01.095
but why can't you get here on
time for the love of fuck?!

28:01.262 --> 28:05.015
Oh.
You have that word in England, too.

28:05.183 --> 28:07.601
Marilyn has to prepare properly.

28:07.769 --> 28:10.938
Acting isn't just a case
of putting on a costume or a false nose.

28:11.106 --> 28:12.481
You must apologize to Dame Sybil.

28:17.112 --> 28:17.611
Sybil?

28:22.951 --> 28:27.121
- I'm so sorry.
- My dear, you mustn't concern yourself.

28:27.288 --> 28:29.873
A great actress like you has
many other things on her mind.

28:30.041 --> 28:32.084
You think I'm a great actress?

28:32.252 --> 28:35.879
None of the rest of us truly
know how to act for the camera,

28:36.047 --> 28:38.882
but you do. It's a rare gift.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.887
This poor girl hasn't had
your years of experience.

28:44.055 --> 28:47.057
She's in a strange country
acting a strange part.

28:47.225 --> 28:48.851
Now, are you helping or bullying?

28:51.396 --> 28:53.397
Oh, thank you.

28:57.485 --> 28:58.652
Before you meet my mother-in-law,

28:58.820 --> 29:03.449
I must warn you she's a little vague
and can be very deaf on occasions.

29:04.117 --> 29:05.576
Uh, two is good, Jack. Yeah.

29:05.744 --> 29:07.286
OK, let's cut it there.

29:07.454 --> 29:09.997
- Speed.
- Five, take one.

29:10.165 --> 29:12.207
- OK.
- Action.

29:12.375 --> 29:15.502
When one is old,
one should use much more.

29:15.670 --> 29:19.506
- What do you do, my dear?
- I'm The Coconut...

29:19.674 --> 29:22.468
And once again, please.
Keep rolling.

29:22.635 --> 29:25.721
- I'm in The Coconut Girl at the Avenue.
- Excellent.

29:25.889 --> 29:28.932
I do need you to keep your eyes
open if you can, my angel.

29:29.100 --> 29:30.684
Paula, would you give the line, please?

29:30.852 --> 29:33.187
Wait, I know it.

29:33.354 --> 29:35.606
I'm in The Coconut Girl on the Avenue.

29:35.774 --> 29:39.276
- At the Avenue.
- I'm at the Avenue.

29:39.444 --> 29:41.111
It's not at the Avenue.

29:41.279 --> 29:43.489
Uh, Sybil, would you
give her the line again?

29:43.656 --> 29:46.200
- Thank you.
- What do you do, my dear?

29:46.367 --> 29:49.495
I'm in The Coconut Girl at the Avenue.

29:51.289 --> 29:55.751
That one's pretty damn good.
You knocked it outta the park.

29:55.919 --> 29:59.046
- She says she's an actress.
- When Marilyn gets it right,

29:59.214 --> 30:01.340
you just don't wanna
look at anyone else.

30:01.508 --> 30:03.383
Cut it there.

30:07.972 --> 30:11.141
We've only been shooting for four days.
Already, we're two weeks behind.

30:11.309 --> 30:15.103
So why not only show her the good takes.
She might feel better about herself.

30:15.271 --> 30:17.356
Well, the kid's right.
She could use the confidence.

30:17.524 --> 30:20.526
No one's forcing her to watch.
Besides, she's an experienced actress.

30:20.693 --> 30:23.570
- She should learn from her mistakes.
- But they only upset her.

30:23.738 --> 30:26.240
Not half so much as they upset me!

30:28.576 --> 30:31.578
Leave all that.
Go and find Marilyn's script.

30:31.746 --> 30:33.288
Paula thinks she's left it
in her dressing room.

30:33.456 --> 30:34.998
Yes.

30:49.264 --> 30:52.891
- Your script...
- Oh, I found it.

30:54.644 --> 30:56.854
You can go now, Colin.

31:13.288 --> 31:16.206
David wants to know if you're ready
for the extras in the ballroom scene.

31:16.374 --> 31:18.834
Tell him he can start
sending them up. Women first.

31:23.089 --> 31:24.798
I'm looking forward to Saturday.

31:26.175 --> 31:28.719
- Our date.
- Oh, I completely forgot.

31:28.887 --> 31:31.638
I can't do Saturday.
Marilyn wants to go shopping.

31:31.806 --> 31:33.682
Since when do you work for her?

31:33.850 --> 31:35.142
Next Friday instead.

31:38.062 --> 31:39.897
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'll pick you up. Eight o'clock.

31:49.115 --> 31:51.992
- Gee, it's quiet.
- Sure is.

31:52.160 --> 31:55.162
It's a Saturday, so it's early closing,
but at least she can shop in peace.

31:55.330 --> 31:58.957
That's awfully pretty.
Every building here looks like a castle.

31:59.125 --> 32:01.251
Oh, I think so.

32:01.419 --> 32:02.711
Look.

32:02.879 --> 32:05.380
- It's Marilyn!
- It's Marilyn Monroe!

32:05.548 --> 32:08.216
- OK.
- It's her!

32:12.221 --> 32:14.389
Slow down.
You'll get your autograph.

32:14.557 --> 32:16.516
- Whoa!
- You're so kind!

32:17.685 --> 32:19.478
Boy, you're awfully excited.

32:19.646 --> 32:21.396
- OK, guys, let's keep calm.
- Marilyn!

32:21.564 --> 32:23.523
- Hold back a little.
- It's for my son.

32:23.691 --> 32:25.317
Wait your turn!

32:27.987 --> 32:31.239
This is too much.

32:31.407 --> 32:32.824
- Oh!
- Colin, get in the car!

32:32.992 --> 32:34.368
Stand back a few feet, please.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.545
Jeez, Marilyn, they really love you.

32:56.766 --> 32:59.226
Well, we're still
the first ones, aren't we?

33:01.187 --> 33:03.271
Gee, this is all right, isn't it?

33:03.439 --> 33:07.818
Cut. Uh, the line is,
"Gee, this is all right, too, isn't it?"

33:07.986 --> 33:10.320
It's a tiny word, my darling,
but it does matter. So we'll...

33:10.488 --> 33:12.948
We'll do it again. Once more, please,
straight away. Thank you so much.

33:13.116 --> 33:14.908
- All right, as soon as we can.
- Turn over.

33:18.454 --> 33:20.706
Well, we're still
the first ones, aren't we?

33:20.873 --> 33:24.001
- Gee, this is all right, isn't it?
- Cut.

33:25.253 --> 33:27.754
- Can't we just drop it?
- Well, the thing is, darling,

33:27.922 --> 33:30.924
you've already admired the downstairs
hall in the earlier scene,

33:31.092 --> 33:35.554
and now you're admiring
this room as well.

33:35.722 --> 33:36.888
If you see what I mean?

33:37.765 --> 33:41.059
- Oh, sure.
- Thank you.

33:41.227 --> 33:44.187
- Turn over.
- Paula?

33:44.355 --> 33:45.772
Christ.

33:45.940 --> 33:47.941
I don't get it.

33:48.109 --> 33:50.610
He's such a strange man,
I think she's already figured out

33:50.778 --> 33:52.779
that he only invited her here
to sleep with him.

33:52.947 --> 33:54.614
l... What...
So, what is the...?

33:54.782 --> 33:56.950
The reason Marilyn can't
remember the line

33:57.118 --> 34:00.162
is because she doesn't believe
the situation her character is in.

34:01.456 --> 34:03.957
Then she should pretend to believe it.

34:04.125 --> 34:06.251
"Pretend"? We're talking
about the difference

34:06.419 --> 34:08.962
between the truth and artificial crap.

34:09.130 --> 34:11.256
We're in absolute agreement.
Acting is all about truth,

34:11.424 --> 34:13.133
and if you can fake that,
you'll have a jolly good career.

34:13.301 --> 34:15.093
Maybe we should try for another take.

34:15.261 --> 34:17.387
Marilyn needs time
to give a great performance.

34:17.555 --> 34:18.805
You should give her as long as it takes.

34:18.973 --> 34:20.807
Chaplin took eight months
to make a movie.

34:20.975 --> 34:23.060
Eight months of this?

34:23.227 --> 34:25.645
- I'd rather kill myself.
- Oh!

34:30.401 --> 34:32.152
I can't do this.

34:32.320 --> 34:34.446
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. Yes, you can.

34:34.614 --> 34:36.990
You can do it. You can't fail.

34:37.158 --> 34:39.868
You'll have more pain,
you will suffer more,

34:40.036 --> 34:43.205
but you will create.
All you need is time.

34:43.372 --> 34:45.957
Think about the things
you like instead of him.

34:46.125 --> 34:48.585
Frank Sinatra. Hmm?

34:48.753 --> 34:51.171
Coca-Cola.

34:51.339 --> 34:54.466
Use your substitutions
and make it work for you.

34:54.634 --> 34:55.759
- OK.
- OK.

34:55.927 --> 34:58.345
Two-eight-one, take 17.

35:01.140 --> 35:04.935
Oh, we're still the first ones,
aren't we?

35:05.103 --> 35:09.439
Gee, this is all right, too, isn't it?

35:12.485 --> 35:14.986
Then she goes...
She...

35:17.031 --> 35:19.574
Cut! What is the matter now?

35:19.742 --> 35:21.326
You wait! Marilyn, please.

35:21.494 --> 35:23.829
Please, tell me how I can help you.

35:23.996 --> 35:27.040
I don't know who Elsie is, and I can't
act her if I don't know who she is.

35:27.208 --> 35:31.461
You have her precisely. You understand
her inside out. I'm in awe of your gift.

35:31.629 --> 35:33.505
- We all are.
- She's not real.

35:33.673 --> 35:38.593
Then why not simply rely
on your natural talents?

35:40.888 --> 35:43.223
So are you saying you
don't want me to act?

35:43.391 --> 35:47.519
Marilyn, will you just try to be sexy.
Isn't that what you do?

35:50.398 --> 35:53.400
I want Lee.

35:53.568 --> 35:55.402
- You've already got Paula...
- I want Lee!

35:55.570 --> 35:56.903
- I'm the director.
- I'm Lee's representative.

35:57.071 --> 35:58.989
It's 5:00 in the morning in New York.

35:59.157 --> 36:00.365
I want Lee!

36:01.742 --> 36:04.494
Oh, now forever,

36:04.662 --> 36:08.165
farewell the tranquil mind,

36:08.332 --> 36:11.001
farewell content...

36:11.169 --> 36:13.753
Farewell the plumed troops

36:13.921 --> 36:19.926
and the big wars that make
ambition virtue. Oh, farewell!

36:20.303 --> 36:21.803
Paula's not an actress!

36:21.971 --> 36:23.597
She's not a director,
she's not a teacher!

36:23.764 --> 36:25.724
Her only talent is buttering up Marilyn!

36:25.892 --> 36:29.644
Larry, she needs her people.
We're the only family she's ever had.

36:29.812 --> 36:33.064
Do you know what would make Marilyn
Monroe a real actor? A season in rep.

36:33.232 --> 36:35.567
They wouldn't stand for this nonsense
at the Hippodrome in Eastbourne.

36:35.735 --> 36:37.611
Larry, you have to be patient with her.

36:37.778 --> 36:41.489
Trying to teach Marilyn how to act
is like teaching Urdu to a badger!

36:44.285 --> 36:48.163
I better go see her. She'll need
something to help her calm down.

36:51.459 --> 36:54.002
Christ! Pills to sleep.
Pills to wake up.

36:54.170 --> 36:55.754
Pills to calm her down.
Pills to give her energy.

36:55.922 --> 36:59.174
No wonder she's permanently
ten feet underwater!

37:00.927 --> 37:02.886
- Maybe she's scared.
- We're all scared!

37:03.054 --> 37:06.097
I've spent half of my professional life
in abject bloody terror!

37:06.265 --> 37:08.016
It's what actors do!

37:08.184 --> 37:09.476
But you have the training
to deal with it, sir.

37:09.644 --> 37:12.479
I wouldn't buy the "little
girl lost" act if I were you.

37:13.898 --> 37:16.233
Though heaven knows, it's tempting.

37:16.400 --> 37:19.653
I think Marilyn knows
exactly what she's doing.

37:26.410 --> 37:30.247
Look, you better get over to Parkside
and make sure the poor girl's all right.

37:43.219 --> 37:47.639
Marilyn's OK. She's taken
some pills and gone to bed.

37:47.807 --> 37:51.726
They like to keep her doped up.
It makes her easier to control.

37:52.728 --> 37:55.897
They're terrified their
cash cow will slip away.

37:56.065 --> 37:57.732
Cheers.

38:08.327 --> 38:10.870
Why does everybody
always think I'm crazy?

38:11.038 --> 38:12.706
I'm not crazy.

38:51.912 --> 38:54.664
Marilyn, come back to bed.

38:58.127 --> 39:02.005
It's not about you.
It's not what you think.

39:02.173 --> 39:04.841
It's just a few ideas.

39:06.927 --> 39:08.553
Writer stuff.

39:11.807 --> 39:17.395
Come on, let's get some sleep
and bring back my book.

39:26.113 --> 39:28.031
Don't touch me.

39:35.831 --> 39:37.415
Good morning, Miss Monroe.

39:47.593 --> 39:50.970
- It's nearly lunchtime.
- She's not feeling the part.

39:51.138 --> 39:54.057
It's a light comedy. How much
feeling can it possibly require?

39:54.225 --> 39:56.726
Just give her a few minutes, Larry.

39:56.894 --> 39:58.561
Boy, will you find out what
the hell is going on, please?

40:18.207 --> 40:21.042
It's Colin. Come in.

40:29.552 --> 40:31.719
Are you all right, Miss Monroe?

40:34.014 --> 40:37.934
- How old are you?
- Twenty-four.

40:38.102 --> 40:41.604
Nearly. I'm... I'm 23.
I'm nearly 24.

40:45.234 --> 40:48.653
Do you know you remind us of
the young king in the movie?

40:48.821 --> 40:50.780
And so...

40:50.948 --> 40:55.243
...uh ...sweet.

40:56.912 --> 40:58.580
And innocent.

40:59.748 --> 41:02.250
I'm not sure I'm that innocent.

41:06.088 --> 41:08.673
So, what's your job on this picture?

41:08.841 --> 41:12.177
I'm the third assistant director.
So, it's a gofer, really.

41:12.344 --> 41:14.429
"Go for this, go for that."

41:16.015 --> 41:18.391
But you're Larry's assistant, too.

41:18.559 --> 41:20.393
Yes.

41:20.561 --> 41:23.521
What were you doing
in my house last night?

41:24.732 --> 41:27.192
Did he send you?

41:27.359 --> 41:28.776
He was worried about you.

41:32.990 --> 41:35.116
Are you spying on me?

41:35.284 --> 41:38.077
No, of course not.
Why would anyone spy on you?

41:46.420 --> 41:49.047
Colin.

41:49.215 --> 41:52.383
Whose side are you on?

41:55.554 --> 41:57.680
Yours, Miss Monroe.

42:04.772 --> 42:06.898
Call me Marilyn.

42:13.948 --> 42:16.491
Marilyn's got a new boyfriend.

42:17.576 --> 42:19.661
- Larry will get jealous.
- Nothing happened.

42:19.828 --> 42:23.331
You were there for ten minutes.
Plenty of time for a kiss and a cuddle.

42:26.460 --> 42:30.255
I dreamed last night
that I could hear singing.

42:30.422 --> 42:32.840
And then I realized it wasn't a dream.

42:33.008 --> 42:37.512
There was a male voice choir
serenading Marilyn under our window.

42:37.680 --> 42:39.806
At two in the morning.

42:39.974 --> 42:42.517
It's a circus. Freak show.

42:42.685 --> 42:45.103
I'm going back to New York
for a few days.

42:46.313 --> 42:49.357
I need a break.
I need to see my kids.

42:49.525 --> 42:52.068
- That won't help Marilyn.
- I can't help her.

42:53.320 --> 42:56.906
She wants me to protect her,
but... I can't.

42:57.074 --> 43:00.368
She thought I could smash
all her insecurities.

43:00.536 --> 43:02.203
That I can make her a new person.

43:02.371 --> 43:05.039
She read some notes I made.

43:05.207 --> 43:07.292
They were nothing.
Just... Just a few ideas.

43:07.459 --> 43:11.963
- But about her?
- She took them the wrong way.

43:13.674 --> 43:18.052
You do... love her,
your new bride and all that?

43:18.220 --> 43:20.221
I can't work.

43:21.223 --> 43:23.016
I can't think.

43:24.602 --> 43:26.644
She's devouring me.

43:30.941 --> 43:34.027
Good morning, Vivien.

43:34.194 --> 43:36.279
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
my darling wife.

43:36.447 --> 43:40.116
Hello. I hope Larry isn't
making you all work too hard.

43:40.284 --> 43:44.120
I know what a dreadful
slave-driver he could be.

43:44.288 --> 43:46.914
David. He would be lost without you.

43:47.082 --> 43:49.584
- Just doing my job.
- And Jack, of course. Jack.

43:49.752 --> 43:52.337
Oh. I'm getting old, Jack.

43:52.504 --> 43:54.297
More beautiful every year, Vivien.

43:54.465 --> 43:57.634
Well, I need you to work
your miracles on me.

43:57.801 --> 43:59.844
Are you looking after Larry
like I told you?

44:00.012 --> 44:01.429
I'm doing my best, Vivien.

44:03.098 --> 44:05.058
Marilyn, darling.

44:05.225 --> 44:10.938
Larry tells me
that you are quite superb,

44:11.106 --> 44:14.484
- and I am wild with jealousy.
- Oh.

44:14.652 --> 44:17.737
But everyone says you were
a wonderful Elsie on stage.

44:17.905 --> 44:20.490
Oh, but I'm too old
to play her in the film.

44:20.658 --> 44:23.576
Larry was quite brutal about that.

44:23.744 --> 44:27.372
You see, the truth
is all that matters to him,

44:27.539 --> 44:30.541
and that's why we all
admire him so very much.

44:30.709 --> 44:34.212
I must let you work.
I just wanted to wish you good luck.

44:36.799 --> 44:39.509
- Hi, Vivien.
- Goodbye, and you.

44:39.677 --> 44:43.554
I love the mustache. I do.

44:43.722 --> 44:45.098
It suits you. Bye...

44:47.810 --> 44:50.895
So I wasn't addressed.
Who cares?

44:52.106 --> 44:54.357
Bull in the labyrinth. Oop!

44:54.525 --> 44:57.610
Who the heck is Theseus anyway?

44:57.778 --> 45:00.238
I didn't think she
would be so beautiful.

45:00.406 --> 45:03.866
- Disgraceful!
- Oh, she shines on that screen.

45:04.034 --> 45:06.411
Oh, darling.
Puss, don't upset yourself.

45:06.578 --> 45:08.871
You are ten times
the actress she will ever be.

45:09.039 --> 45:12.875
Oh, if you could see yourself.
The way you watch her!

45:13.043 --> 45:15.837
Oh, Vivien, you're imagining things.
Please.

45:16.004 --> 45:17.964
I hope she makes your life hell.

45:18.132 --> 45:21.467
Vivien...

45:28.225 --> 45:30.393
Do you have a cigarette,
please, Colin?

45:33.605 --> 45:35.440
No, not one of my awful things.

45:45.075 --> 45:48.202
Remember, boy,
when it comes to women,

45:48.370 --> 45:51.748
you're never too old for humiliation.

45:53.125 --> 45:56.002
Marilyn won't shoot today.
She's gone back to Parkside.

45:56.170 --> 45:58.629
She's upset about
Arthur leaving England.

45:58.797 --> 46:00.506
He's only going to visit his children.

46:00.674 --> 46:04.302
You don't leave Marilyn alone.
She can't handle it.

46:04.470 --> 46:06.637
She thinks that everyone's
going to abandon her.

46:08.557 --> 46:10.683
Let's hope she's
changed her bloody mind.

46:10.851 --> 46:12.685
- Yes.
- Sir Laurence?

46:12.853 --> 46:17.023
- Roger, what's up?
- Is, uh, Colin there, sir?

46:17.191 --> 46:20.026
- Yes, he is.
- Can I speak to him?

46:20.194 --> 46:22.487
Colin, it's for you.

46:27.576 --> 46:30.119
- Roger?
- Colin.

46:30.287 --> 46:31.454
Miss Monroe.

46:32.289 --> 46:35.166
Why don't you drop by here
on your way home.

46:35.793 --> 46:38.044
- Uh...
- What?

46:38.212 --> 46:40.797
What is Marilyn doing on the phone
with my third fucking assistant?

46:40.964 --> 46:43.341
Yes, I'm sure I could do that.

46:43.509 --> 46:45.134
Good.

46:45.302 --> 46:47.845
Don't tell anyone, though.

46:51.016 --> 46:52.725
Well, is she coming back?

46:52.893 --> 46:54.227
No, she wants to see me.

46:54.394 --> 46:56.354
He shouldn't be talking to her.
He's just a kid.

46:56.522 --> 46:59.524
- Supposing he said something.
- I'm sure Colin knows what he's doing.

46:59.691 --> 47:01.359
Don't you, Colin?

47:05.239 --> 47:06.864
I know you're awfully busy, Colin,

47:07.032 --> 47:09.742
but if you could manage to find
me a cup of tea before you leave,

47:09.910 --> 47:11.744
that would be marvelous.

47:13.831 --> 47:15.665
Miss Monroe said
for you to wait.

47:21.755 --> 47:23.256
Help yourself to a drink.

47:23.423 --> 47:26.801
Oh, I'm sorry. I was checking
that you've got everything.

47:26.969 --> 47:28.886
Let me.

47:36.895 --> 47:38.437
Are you frightened of me, Colin?

47:38.605 --> 47:39.856
No.

47:41.358 --> 47:43.442
Good. 'Cause I like you.

47:47.322 --> 47:49.115
I want you to help me.

47:49.283 --> 47:51.701
Well, I'm only the third.
I'm just... I'm a messenger, really.

47:51.869 --> 47:53.786
But you know everything
that's going on.

47:53.954 --> 47:56.455
You can see both sides of the situation.

47:56.623 --> 47:59.125
Please tell me everything.

47:59.293 --> 48:04.171
- Uh...
- Relax.

48:04.339 --> 48:07.091
l thought you weren't scared of me.

48:09.720 --> 48:11.262
- Are you hungry?
- Uh...

48:11.430 --> 48:13.764
I'll have them send in a tray.
I'm starved.

48:15.726 --> 48:18.269
Oh, go... Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.

48:18.437 --> 48:20.146
Am l interrupting something?

48:20.314 --> 48:22.315
Maybe you have a Mrs. Colin
waiting for you at home.

48:22.482 --> 48:25.151
There's no Mrs. Colin.

48:25.319 --> 48:28.362
So we can talk as long as we like.

48:30.324 --> 48:32.658
Why is Sir Olivier so mean?

48:34.119 --> 48:35.828
He talks awfuI to me.

48:35.996 --> 48:38.623
Like he's slumming.

48:40.083 --> 48:41.709
I'll tell you what's wrong.

48:41.877 --> 48:44.795
It's agony for him
because he is a great actor

48:44.963 --> 48:47.798
that wants to be a film star.
And it's agony for you

48:47.966 --> 48:50.927
because you're a film star who
wants to be a great actress.

48:51.094 --> 48:54.388
And this film won't help either of you.

48:57.726 --> 48:59.685
You sure you can handle that?

48:59.853 --> 49:01.437
You don't look old enough to drink.

49:01.605 --> 49:05.024
- I'm 23, Miss Monroe.
- Oh, it's Marilyn.

49:05.859 --> 49:08.027
Hmm. I'm 30.

49:08.654 --> 49:10.446
l guess that makes me
an old lady to you.

49:10.614 --> 49:12.698
Seven years is nothing.

49:12.866 --> 49:15.534
You know I've been
married three times already.

49:15.702 --> 49:17.495
How did that happen?

49:17.663 --> 49:19.288
Maybe you're just
looking for the right man.

49:19.456 --> 49:23.125
They always look right at the start.

49:25.879 --> 49:28.464
I'll get that.

49:30.634 --> 49:32.551
- Hello?
- Colin, is everything OK?

49:32.719 --> 49:34.887
Everything's fine.
Uh, Miss Monroe, she just...

49:35.055 --> 49:37.306
She had some large packages
she needed handling.

49:37.474 --> 49:39.725
OK, what does she want?

49:39.893 --> 49:41.185
Colin?

49:41.353 --> 49:43.771
- Let me speak to her, Colin.
- Oh...

49:43.939 --> 49:46.107
Let me talk to her. Sh!

49:46.608 --> 49:49.276
Let me speak to her.

49:49.444 --> 49:51.696
What is going on, Colin?

49:51.863 --> 49:55.241
I'm afraid she's tied up right now.

49:55.409 --> 49:56.534
Let me talk to her, damn it.

49:56.702 --> 49:58.411
Let me talk to her.

49:58.578 --> 49:59.829
- Colin!
- I'm sorry, Milton.

49:59.997 --> 50:03.040
- I'm sorry. I have to go.
- Colin!

50:09.589 --> 50:12.216
Let's go for a walk in the garden.

50:12.384 --> 50:15.678
Let's go see if we can find any more
reporters in the bushes.

50:21.351 --> 50:24.979
Oh, I didn't know
it was so pretty out here.

50:25.147 --> 50:27.857
You should get out more.
You should see the sights.

50:28.025 --> 50:30.609
I am the sights.

50:30.777 --> 50:34.655
You know, we're just like
Elsie and the young king.

50:39.494 --> 50:43.039
What would Sir Laurence say
if he could see us now?

50:43.206 --> 50:45.541
I don't think he'd mind.

50:47.419 --> 50:49.879
But he thinks that I'm the enemy.

50:50.047 --> 50:51.964
No, he doesn't understand
your kind of actor.

50:52.132 --> 50:55.217
He's hated the Method ever since
Vivien worked with Elia Kazan.

50:55.385 --> 50:57.261
It's all too strange and new.

50:57.429 --> 51:00.139
So you're the future,
and that frightens him.

51:00.307 --> 51:03.642
You know what?
Every time I walk into the studio,

51:03.810 --> 51:07.730
I feel a sense of doom come over me.

51:09.566 --> 51:13.611
He gives me the dirtiest looks,
even when he's smiling.

51:14.654 --> 51:16.155
And the crew hates me.

51:16.323 --> 51:17.448
No, that's not true.

51:17.616 --> 51:21.118
The only person I can trust is Paula.

51:21.286 --> 51:23.037
Except for you now, maybe.

51:23.205 --> 51:26.749
Phone call from New York,
Miss Monroe. It's Mr. Miller.

51:33.298 --> 51:35.299
- Goodbye, Colin.
- Goodbye.

51:35.467 --> 51:37.718
Thank you for telling me the truth.

51:41.473 --> 51:44.016
You'll be leaving now, I expect.

51:45.477 --> 51:47.520
I don't care if he fucks her sideways.

51:47.687 --> 51:49.772
Perhaps it'll calm her down.

51:49.940 --> 51:52.108
Oh, hello, boy.

51:52.275 --> 51:54.443
Hear you spent
last night with Marilyn.

51:54.611 --> 51:56.529
I didn't spend the night with her.
We just... We had a chat.

51:56.696 --> 51:59.323
- I heard them chuckling.
- Perhaps if Colin is very diplomatic,

51:59.491 --> 52:01.367
Marilyn's more likely to behave herself.

52:01.535 --> 52:03.202
- She just wants a chum, that's all.
- A chum?

52:03.370 --> 52:06.163
Jesus Christ, what is this,
Goodbye, Mr. Chips?

52:06.331 --> 52:07.915
Grow up, kid.

52:13.547 --> 52:17.049
You know, I thought working with Marilyn
would make me feel young again.

52:19.052 --> 52:21.720
But I look dead in the rushes.

52:21.888 --> 52:24.473
Dead behind these eyes.

52:27.894 --> 52:30.813
I wanted to renew myself through her.

52:32.065 --> 52:35.609
But all I see reflected
in that magnificent face

52:35.777 --> 52:38.612
is my own inadequacy.

52:42.659 --> 52:45.911
You know, I admire Marilyn.
I really do, despite her behavior.

52:48.707 --> 52:50.624
She's taken everything
Hollywood can throw at her

52:50.792 --> 52:52.751
and she's triumphed.
That takes some bloody guts.

52:54.921 --> 52:57.256
An actress has to be pretty tough

52:57.424 --> 53:00.885
to get even a tenth as far as she has.

53:02.888 --> 53:04.054
Be careful, boy.

53:05.682 --> 53:07.892
She doesn't need to be rescued.

53:08.059 --> 53:09.935
Not really.

54:04.950 --> 54:06.825
It's you.

54:08.328 --> 54:10.162
Marvelous!
Absolutely marvelous, darling.

54:10.330 --> 54:12.206
That's wonderful. Well done.
Let's check that.

54:26.721 --> 54:29.431
Three minutes, ladies
and gentlemen. Three minutes!

54:29.599 --> 54:33.477
Colin! Arthur Miller called me.
He's not happy with you.

54:33.645 --> 54:36.480
- He doesn't even know who I am.
- Marilyn must have said something.

54:36.648 --> 54:38.774
Well, maybe she's trying
to make him jealous.

54:43.405 --> 54:46.740
Listen, kid. I've known
Marilyn for seven years.

54:46.908 --> 54:48.450
I fell in love with her
just as you've done.

54:48.618 --> 54:50.869
We had ten days together,
and that was it.

54:51.037 --> 54:53.872
She picked me up, she put me
down, that's what she does.

54:54.040 --> 54:56.292
She breaks hearts.
She will break yours.

54:56.459 --> 55:00.087
My advice to you is quit
before you get burned.

55:00.255 --> 55:04.216
- I don't need your advice.
- Have it your way.

55:04.384 --> 55:06.385
You don't see Marilyn again.
You don't even talk to her.

55:06.553 --> 55:09.972
She's completely off limits to you.
Do you understand me?

55:10.140 --> 55:12.266
Yes.

55:14.853 --> 55:17.354
- I waited for you on Friday.
- Lucy, I'm so sorry.

55:17.522 --> 55:19.231
I completely forgot.
I just... I've been so busy.

55:19.399 --> 55:21.317
So I hear.

55:21.484 --> 55:23.652
Well, you know how crews gossip.
There's nothing in it.

55:23.820 --> 55:26.238
Of course there isn't.

55:26.406 --> 55:28.866
Marilyn Monroe fancying you?
Come on.

55:33.246 --> 55:34.496
- Oh, hi, Colin.
- Hi.

55:34.664 --> 55:36.123
Hi, Lucy.

55:42.964 --> 55:47.384
- I thought you were different.
- I really like you, and we have fun.

55:47.552 --> 55:50.387
And now it's time to set
your sights a little higher.

55:53.266 --> 55:54.975
Well, good luck.

56:19.167 --> 56:21.293
Get in.
Any problem, Roger?

56:21.461 --> 56:24.296
Uh, no. Just dropped by
to take Colin out to lunch.

56:24.464 --> 56:26.423
You're not taking him to Marilyn.

56:26.591 --> 56:28.759
That would drop us all
in a whole ocean of shit.

56:28.927 --> 56:31.845
No, sir. Been looking forward
to this, haven't we, Colin?

56:32.013 --> 56:33.472
Yeah.

56:36.184 --> 56:38.477
OK. You have a nice time, boys.

56:40.980 --> 56:43.690
- Surprise!
- Jesus!

56:43.858 --> 56:46.110
Roger and I decided
to take you on an adventure.

56:47.821 --> 56:50.322
What the hell?

56:50.490 --> 56:51.740
- Colin!
- Oh!

56:53.034 --> 56:55.494
Get back here, you little bastard!

56:55.662 --> 56:58.914
Colin! You're fired! You hear me?

57:02.168 --> 57:03.585
Do you think he saw me?

57:03.753 --> 57:05.003
Colin!

57:08.091 --> 57:10.717
Snuggle up. This is fun.

57:11.428 --> 57:13.262
This is the getaway car.

57:27.318 --> 57:29.069
I oughta feel like this every day.

57:30.738 --> 57:34.032
We have today, anyway.

57:34.200 --> 57:37.202
We have one day to do
whatever you like.

57:37.370 --> 57:38.871
Then we can go back
to real life tomorrow.

57:39.038 --> 57:41.665
Only one day?

57:41.833 --> 57:44.793
- Well, maybe the weekend.
- Or a week!

57:49.048 --> 57:50.424
What should we do now?

57:50.592 --> 57:52.968
We could go to Windsor Castle,
if you like.

58:00.894 --> 58:03.061
Detective Chief
Superintendent Smith.

58:03.229 --> 58:06.273
I'm escorting this lady
and gentleman for the day.

58:06.441 --> 58:07.733
They'd like to look around the castle.

58:07.901 --> 58:09.902
I need a contact name for the book.

58:10.069 --> 58:12.738
You don't know Her Majesty,
by any chance?

58:12.906 --> 58:16.074
Yes, we met at a movie premiere.
She said my dress was pretty.

58:16.242 --> 58:17.743
I don't think that quite does it, sir.

58:17.911 --> 58:19.703
My godfather works here.

58:19.871 --> 58:22.664
He's the royal librarian.
Sir Owen Morshead.

58:41.768 --> 58:46.813
- Hello, sir.
- Colin, my boy! Come in!

58:46.981 --> 58:50.067
Forgive the dust.

58:50.235 --> 58:53.278
Oh, you are very pretty, my dear.

58:53.446 --> 58:54.780
Oh!

58:55.615 --> 58:57.407
Gee, I'd sure like
to read all these books.

58:57.575 --> 59:00.410
Luckily, one doesn't really have to.

59:00.578 --> 59:02.621
A lot of them just have
pictures in.

59:02.789 --> 59:07.793
- This is by an artist called Holbein.
- She's beautiful.

59:07.961 --> 59:11.672
She was the daughter
of one of the king's courtiers.

59:11.839 --> 59:13.715
Nearly 400 years ago.

59:13.883 --> 59:16.677
Gee, I hope I look that good
when I'm 400.

59:18.930 --> 59:22.516
These are by Leonardo da Vinci.

59:22.684 --> 59:25.227
Didn't he paint that lady
with the funny smile?

59:25.395 --> 59:28.272
- The Mona Lisa.
- Do you have that one here, too?

59:28.439 --> 59:30.941
Alas, that one got away.

59:31.109 --> 59:32.776
Oh.

59:33.319 --> 59:35.654
- The Queen's sorry to have missed you.
- Really?

59:35.822 --> 59:38.574
Oh, yes! Why, she was only
saying to me the other day,

59:38.741 --> 59:43.328
"What must it be like to be
the most famous woman on Earth?"

59:53.214 --> 59:55.048
Colin, look.

59:56.759 --> 1:00:00.804
Gee, I sure never had a doll's house
like this when I was a kid.

1:00:00.972 --> 1:00:04.266
- Can l?
- Yes, of course.

1:00:11.232 --> 1:00:13.275
This is me.

1:00:13.443 --> 1:00:17.362
That's you, and these are our kids.

1:00:20.033 --> 1:00:22.618
Oh, our daughter's so pretty.

1:00:25.496 --> 1:00:28.540
All little girls should be
told how pretty they are.

1:00:30.960 --> 1:00:34.463
Should grow up knowing how
much their mother loves them.

1:00:38.593 --> 1:00:40.052
There she is!

1:00:45.975 --> 1:00:47.809
Shall I be her?

1:00:55.693 --> 1:00:58.862
- Are you somebody, mate?
- No. I'm no one.

1:01:13.961 --> 1:01:16.338
So this
is your old school, huh?

1:01:16.506 --> 1:01:18.507
Did you sing in the school choir?

1:01:18.675 --> 1:01:22.386
- No.
- That's a lie, I can tell.

1:01:22.553 --> 1:01:25.347
How old were you?

1:01:25.515 --> 1:01:27.683
I was sent away to boarding
school when I was eight.

1:01:27.850 --> 1:01:31.061
Why? Didn't your parents
like you very much?

1:01:31.229 --> 1:01:34.231
That's just how they do it in my family.

1:01:34.399 --> 1:01:36.525
Well, I'd never send my kids away.

1:01:36.693 --> 1:01:39.736
Eton is 500 years old.

1:01:39.904 --> 1:01:42.030
It was founded by King Henry VI.

1:01:42.198 --> 1:01:43.949
No wonder it's so dusty.

1:01:44.992 --> 1:01:47.577
Looks more like a palace.

1:01:47.745 --> 1:01:49.538
That room there,
upper school, that's where you're sent

1:01:49.706 --> 1:01:51.748
if you don't work hard enough.
You're whipped.

1:01:51.916 --> 1:01:53.208
- No.
- Mm-hm.

1:01:53.376 --> 1:01:55.836
- That's awful.
- It's Marilyn Monroe!

1:01:59.382 --> 1:02:01.091
Oh!

1:02:02.802 --> 1:02:04.428
Look who it is!

1:02:05.221 --> 1:02:08.640
- Come see Marilyn.
- Well, hello, boys.

1:02:08.808 --> 1:02:11.226
- Pleased to meet you!
- Blow us a kiss, Marilyn!

1:02:11.394 --> 1:02:15.939
Sure. All right, boys. Work hard!
I don't want anyone whipping you.

1:02:16.107 --> 1:02:18.233
You can whip me anytime, Marilyn!

1:02:18.401 --> 1:02:19.192
Oh!

1:02:20.570 --> 1:02:22.362
Oh!

1:02:22.530 --> 1:02:25.782
- Maybe we should go.
- It's time to go. Lovely to see you.

1:02:36.210 --> 1:02:38.628
Hurry up, slowpoke!

1:02:42.633 --> 1:02:44.801
There's no...
We haven't got our... We can't...

1:02:48.723 --> 1:02:54.811
Oh, God.

1:02:59.192 --> 1:03:01.401
This is great.

1:03:05.031 --> 1:03:08.825
Oh, my God!

1:03:08.993 --> 1:03:11.244
What if a boat goes past?
We'll be arrested.

1:03:11.412 --> 1:03:14.331
Don't worry. Roger will fix it.

1:03:19.420 --> 1:03:21.296
- Ooh!
- What?

1:03:21.464 --> 1:03:25.008
- I have something in my eye.
- Let me see.

1:03:27.470 --> 1:03:28.595
I can't see anything.

1:03:33.601 --> 1:03:38.313
That's the first time
I've kissed anyone younger than me.

1:03:38.481 --> 1:03:43.193
There's a lot
of older guys in Hollywood.

1:03:47.156 --> 1:03:48.114
Ooh.

1:04:02.421 --> 1:04:05.340
Don't be shy, Colin.
It's nothing you haven't seen before.

1:04:12.682 --> 1:04:17.143
Oh, Colin. And you, an old Etonian.

1:04:17.311 --> 1:04:19.938
My God, it's cold. It's freezing!

1:04:28.447 --> 1:04:31.324
Here. Come here. Let me warm you up.

1:04:32.994 --> 1:04:35.453
Is that better?

1:04:37.790 --> 1:04:41.751
I want this to be the perfect date.

1:04:41.919 --> 1:04:45.505
I haven't had a real date
since I was 13 years old.

1:05:01.939 --> 1:05:03.607
That was nice.

1:05:06.569 --> 1:05:11.031
Ahem! Time to go home,
I think, Miss Monroe.

1:05:27.548 --> 1:05:30.342
Be careful not
to get in too deep, son.

1:06:31.237 --> 1:06:32.737
Hi, Milton.

1:06:33.614 --> 1:06:37.033
The next time I come on set,
you better make sure Colin is there.

1:06:37.201 --> 1:06:38.410
Take him home.

1:06:50.506 --> 1:06:52.882
You spent the day with her.
What frame of mind was she in?

1:06:53.050 --> 1:06:54.676
- She was fine, sir.
- Oh, how lovely.

1:06:54.844 --> 1:06:56.845
Well, go and find out why
she's not standing here

1:06:57.013 --> 1:06:59.431
right now in front of that.
There's a good chap.

1:06:59.598 --> 1:07:01.599
And perhaps on this splendid
day we can persuade her

1:07:01.767 --> 1:07:05.061
to do some of the work that she is
currently paying herself to do.

1:07:06.439 --> 1:07:09.691
- Don't start, Dickie.
- You won't get any sympathy from me.

1:07:09.859 --> 1:07:12.527
- She's trying her best.
- Oh, dear.

1:07:12.695 --> 1:07:14.821
Little Colin's in love.

1:07:19.326 --> 1:07:22.620
- Colin?
- What's the matter?

1:07:22.788 --> 1:07:25.248
It's Marilyn.
She's asking for you.

1:07:33.466 --> 1:07:35.091
She hasn't made a sound
for over an hour.

1:07:35.259 --> 1:07:37.927
- So how many pills did she take?
- Jesus! Who knows.

1:07:38.095 --> 1:07:40.930
- I wasn't counting.
- Marilyn? So how about the window?

1:07:42.308 --> 1:07:45.769
Marilyn, darling?
Open the door, bubbeleh.

1:07:48.814 --> 1:07:50.106
That's her window.

1:07:59.200 --> 1:08:00.533
Marilyn?

1:08:01.660 --> 1:08:03.453
Marilyn.

1:08:06.123 --> 1:08:07.665
Colin?

1:08:07.833 --> 1:08:10.376
Oh, hi, Colin.

1:08:13.672 --> 1:08:15.924
Are you OK?

1:08:16.092 --> 1:08:17.801
Everyone's worried about you.

1:08:20.554 --> 1:08:22.639
Oh, phooey.

1:08:22.807 --> 1:08:25.183
Colin!

1:08:28.979 --> 1:08:31.272
- Get in.
- Colin!

1:08:31.440 --> 1:08:33.525
Colin, come on, open up!

1:08:33.692 --> 1:08:35.110
- Colin?
- Colin!

1:08:35.277 --> 1:08:37.529
Open this door.
She needs me. Colin!

1:08:37.696 --> 1:08:39.697
You don't understand her.

1:08:39.865 --> 1:08:40.907
- Come on.
- She's fine, uh...

1:08:41.075 --> 1:08:43.326
- Come on, open up!
- I'm gonna keep an eye on her,

1:08:43.494 --> 1:08:44.536
and I will sleep on the sofa.

1:08:44.703 --> 1:08:47.539
Colin, listen to me.
You can't talk to her.

1:08:47.706 --> 1:08:49.624
I can't find the key.
Look, you can all go home now.

1:08:49.792 --> 1:08:53.211
- You don't understand her. Come on.
- Go home.

1:08:53.379 --> 1:08:56.005
Oh, my...

1:09:58.152 --> 1:10:00.945
Colin. What are you doing here?

1:10:02.573 --> 1:10:04.616
Uh, I came in through the window.

1:10:04.783 --> 1:10:05.950
Milton thought that you were sick.

1:10:07.453 --> 1:10:09.287
Oh.

1:10:10.039 --> 1:10:12.040
The window.

1:10:12.208 --> 1:10:14.042
How romantic.

1:10:14.210 --> 1:10:16.294
That's just like Romeo and Juliet.

1:10:18.339 --> 1:10:22.050
What... Why would
they say that I'm sick?

1:10:26.597 --> 1:10:28.139
Please.

1:10:29.683 --> 1:10:31.601
Please don't take any more.

1:10:32.895 --> 1:10:36.397
Who's this? Who's that?

1:10:36.565 --> 1:10:40.485
That's my mama.
She bought me a white piano.

1:10:42.279 --> 1:10:45.073
Right before they
took her to the asylum.

1:10:45.241 --> 1:10:47.825
I grew up in other
people's homes, mostly.

1:10:50.412 --> 1:10:52.163
ls that Abraham Lincoln?

1:10:52.331 --> 1:10:54.499
That's my dad.

1:10:54.667 --> 1:10:59.003
Well, I don't know who my real father
is, so it may as well be him, right?

1:11:04.176 --> 1:11:07.845
Do you have a home, Colin?
A real one?

1:11:08.681 --> 1:11:12.517
- With a mama and a daddy?
- Yes, I do.

1:11:12.685 --> 1:11:14.727
Do they love you?

1:11:15.980 --> 1:11:17.563
I'm sure that they do.

1:11:17.731 --> 1:11:21.943
Mm. You're lucky.

1:11:22.945 --> 1:11:24.529
Yes.

1:11:25.948 --> 1:11:28.157
Do you love me, Colin?

1:11:30.160 --> 1:11:31.744
Yes.

1:11:35.291 --> 1:11:38.042
You're like some Greek goddess to me.

1:11:38.210 --> 1:11:40.044
I'm not a goddess.

1:11:40.879 --> 1:11:44.382
I just wanna be loved
like a regular girl.

1:11:44.550 --> 1:11:48.219
- Mr. Miller loves you.
- No, I found his notebook.

1:11:48.387 --> 1:11:51.597
He said the most
horrible things about me.

1:11:51.765 --> 1:11:54.600
Writers, they scribble all kinds
of things. It doesn't mean anything.

1:11:54.768 --> 1:11:56.728
No, he wanted me to find it.

1:11:56.895 --> 1:12:01.482
He said he wished
he'd never married me.

1:12:03.235 --> 1:12:06.195
Why do the people
I love always leave me?

1:12:06.363 --> 1:12:09.032
I will never leave you.

1:12:16.123 --> 1:12:19.000
All people ever see is Marilyn Monroe.

1:12:21.086 --> 1:12:25.131
As soon as they realize
I'm not her, they run.

1:12:29.303 --> 1:12:31.387
You're different.

1:12:32.598 --> 1:12:34.974
You're not like that.

1:12:39.813 --> 1:12:43.358
You should date that wardrobe girl.

1:12:43.525 --> 1:12:45.860
She's so pretty.

1:12:46.862 --> 1:12:49.614
I don't want to.

1:12:50.908 --> 1:12:52.492
I love you.

1:13:31.365 --> 1:13:33.574
This is nice.

1:13:36.120 --> 1:13:38.663
It's like spoons.

1:13:40.290 --> 1:13:43.084
I used to do this with Johnny.

1:13:43.252 --> 1:13:46.254
- Who's Johnny?
- Johnny Hyde.

1:13:48.632 --> 1:13:52.009
He was my agent back in the old days.

1:13:55.180 --> 1:13:57.932
He was thin just like you.

1:14:02.896 --> 1:14:05.022
Marilyn, do one thing for me.

1:14:05.190 --> 1:14:06.649
Mm...

1:14:08.068 --> 1:14:10.027
Come to the studio on-time tomorrow

1:14:10.195 --> 1:14:12.238
and show everybody what you can do.

1:14:12.406 --> 1:14:15.783
Show Larry that you are a great actress.

1:14:17.911 --> 1:14:19.829
OK.

1:15:34.029 --> 1:15:37.156
Oh, go away, you silly man.

1:15:37.324 --> 1:15:40.910
Miss Marina, your aunt. Do you realize
how serious her condition is?

1:15:41.703 --> 1:15:44.830
Well, it's her own fault.

1:15:44.998 --> 1:15:48.125
She has no right out
this time of night. She's 93!

1:15:50.045 --> 1:15:51.963
Cut it there.

1:15:57.302 --> 1:16:00.179
Well, whatever it was you did
to her, boy, keep doing it.

1:16:00.347 --> 1:16:05.685
I've never seen her so happy.

1:16:05.852 --> 1:16:07.436
- Yes.
- We need Colin

1:16:07.604 --> 1:16:09.021
at the house right away.

1:16:09.189 --> 1:16:11.148
Got a pain in my side,
for Christ's sake.

1:16:11.316 --> 1:16:13.985
What are they trying to make me
think I'm crazy or something?

1:16:14.152 --> 1:16:18.072
ls that what it is? You know I don't
just rev it up like a Model T.

1:16:18.240 --> 1:16:20.324
I don't just crank it up.

1:16:20.492 --> 1:16:23.369
No one's asking you to just crank it up.
We're worried about you...

1:16:23.537 --> 1:16:25.788
Isn't that what you're saying?
I was sick, for God's sake!

1:16:25.956 --> 1:16:28.457
- Can I be sick?
- Colin's here.

1:16:28.625 --> 1:16:32.295
Colin.

1:16:33.338 --> 1:16:36.465
Colin thinks I'm a good actress.
Don't you, Colin?

1:16:36.633 --> 1:16:38.759
- Yes I do. You were wonderful today.
- See?

1:16:38.927 --> 1:16:42.430
- Marilyn's tired now.
- I want him to stay with me.

1:16:42.598 --> 1:16:44.307
And what would Arthur say
if he knew Colin was here?

1:16:44.474 --> 1:16:46.767
You heard what she said,
she wants me here. Come on.

1:16:47.936 --> 1:16:52.356
You have no idea of your
position in the world, Marilyn.

1:16:55.110 --> 1:16:58.529
You are the greatest actress
that has ever been.

1:16:59.573 --> 1:17:01.282
Mm?

1:17:01.450 --> 1:17:03.868
I love you like a daughter.

1:17:04.036 --> 1:17:08.706
- Oh.
- My darling girl. I know it's hard now.

1:17:08.874 --> 1:17:13.044
But you will survive this and go on
to better things. You're young.

1:17:14.046 --> 1:17:17.548
Your life is ahead of you,
just beginning.

1:17:18.759 --> 1:17:20.885
Sit with Colin, mm?

1:17:21.595 --> 1:17:24.722
Oh, Paula, I'm sorry.

1:17:24.890 --> 1:17:27.391
- Come here.
- Oh, no.

1:17:27.559 --> 1:17:30.645
Come here. I'm here now.

1:17:32.814 --> 1:17:34.023
Colin?

1:17:34.191 --> 1:17:37.151
- I'll look after you.
- Don't leave.

1:17:37.319 --> 1:17:38.694
- I'm not.
- Please don't leave.

1:17:38.862 --> 1:17:41.697
- I'm not. Sh.
- Please don't leave.

1:17:41.865 --> 1:17:43.741
Please don't leave.

1:17:51.249 --> 1:17:52.291
Oh.

1:18:04.971 --> 1:18:06.681
Oh, it hurts, it hurts!

1:18:09.017 --> 1:18:11.602
It's a baby! It's a baby!

1:18:11.770 --> 1:18:14.271
I can't lose the baby! Colin!

1:18:14.439 --> 1:18:16.691
Oh!

1:18:16.858 --> 1:18:18.734
Roger! Call a doctor!

1:18:25.951 --> 1:18:27.076
Who's in charge here?

1:18:28.495 --> 1:18:31.163
I've given Mrs. Miller an injection
and the bleeding stopped.

1:18:31.331 --> 1:18:34.875
But she needs to stay in bed tomorrow,
and after that she'll be fine.

1:18:35.961 --> 1:18:37.712
I suggest someone stays with her.

1:18:38.380 --> 1:18:40.131
She'll be safe with me. Thank you.

1:18:48.974 --> 1:18:51.392
- Thank you.
- Good night, then.

1:18:52.769 --> 1:18:54.812
Was she really pregnant, sir?

1:18:57.232 --> 1:19:00.401
I think that's a private matter
between Mr. and Mrs. Miller, don't you?

1:19:22.466 --> 1:19:24.049
Arthur's on his way back.

1:19:31.266 --> 1:19:34.560
When this movie is over,

1:19:34.728 --> 1:19:38.272
I'm gonna settle down
and be a good wife to him.

1:19:41.193 --> 1:19:44.904
I'm gonna learn to make matzo-ball soup
as good as his dad.

1:19:51.119 --> 1:19:53.996
We have to forget this
whole thing ever happened.

1:19:56.374 --> 1:19:57.792
I don't want to forget.

1:20:01.379 --> 1:20:03.380
Let me protect you from all this.

1:20:03.548 --> 1:20:07.676
Oh. What are you gonna do?

1:20:07.844 --> 1:20:09.887
- Marry me?
- Why not?

1:20:10.055 --> 1:20:12.556
You could quit this.
Forget Marilyn Monroe.

1:20:12.724 --> 1:20:14.475
Forget Hollywood. Let it all go.

1:20:16.978 --> 1:20:18.479
Just let it go.

1:20:24.569 --> 1:20:26.028
I couldn't just give it up.

1:20:27.906 --> 1:20:29.490
Why not?

1:20:31.743 --> 1:20:33.911
Why not, when it drives you crazy?

1:20:34.079 --> 1:20:36.038
You think I'm crazy?

1:20:36.206 --> 1:20:39.083
I just meant that you could be happy.

1:20:43.922 --> 1:20:45.840
I am happy.

1:20:47.968 --> 1:20:49.093
Of course you're happy.

1:20:54.140 --> 1:20:56.100
You're the biggest star in the world.

1:21:09.364 --> 1:21:11.073
You're right.
We have to forget all this.

1:21:12.701 --> 1:21:16.579
So from now on, I'm just
the third assistant director,

1:21:16.746 --> 1:21:19.290
and we will never look
at each other again.

1:21:22.752 --> 1:21:24.295
Maybe just a wink.

1:21:27.465 --> 1:21:29.508
Once in a while.

1:21:44.941 --> 1:21:47.318
My dear. My dear.

1:21:47.485 --> 1:21:50.446
- Yes?
- They're ready for you on set.

1:21:50.614 --> 1:21:52.364
- Marilyn?
- Just arrived.

1:21:52.532 --> 1:21:55.034
Only an hour late.
Not bad by her standards.

1:21:56.703 --> 1:21:58.829
Perhaps we'll finish this
bloody film after all.

1:21:59.956 --> 1:22:01.874
Five-two-seven. Take one.

1:22:05.462 --> 1:22:07.379
- Cut it there.
- And check that, please.

1:22:08.298 --> 1:22:09.924
Five-eight-four, take two.

1:22:13.553 --> 1:22:14.637
Take five.

1:22:15.347 --> 1:22:16.889
Six-four-nine, take two.

1:22:18.266 --> 1:22:20.017
Let's cut it there.

1:22:20.185 --> 1:22:21.185
Very quiet, studio.

Cut. That's a wrap.

1:23:26.751 --> 1:23:27.793
She's there.

1:23:44.936 --> 1:23:46.937
I hope you will all forgive me.

1:23:48.898 --> 1:23:52.151
It wasn't altogether my fault,

1:23:54.237 --> 1:23:56.238
but I've been ill.

1:23:59.868 --> 1:24:01.577
I'd like you to remember I tried.

1:24:40.742 --> 1:24:41.950
Lucy, um...

1:24:43.661 --> 1:24:46.497
I was wondering if you were
doing anything on Saturday.

1:24:48.041 --> 1:24:49.833
I'm washing my hair.

1:24:54.589 --> 1:24:55.881
Did she break your heart?

1:24:58.593 --> 1:24:59.718
A little.

1:25:01.179 --> 1:25:03.013
Good. It needed breaking.

1:25:14.484 --> 1:25:16.401
We're back, everyone!

1:25:16.569 --> 1:25:17.736
All right...

1:25:38.883 --> 1:25:43.345
You do look, my son, in a moved
sort, as if you were dismayed.

1:25:43.513 --> 1:25:45.681
Be cheerful, sir.

1:25:47.100 --> 1:25:50.519
Our revels now are ended.

1:25:52.147 --> 1:25:56.150
We are such stuff

1:25:56.317 --> 1:25:59.194
as dreams are made on,

1:25:59.362 --> 1:26:03.240
and our little life

1:26:03.408 --> 1:26:07.703
is rounded with a sleep.

1:26:07.871 --> 1:26:09.580
Prospero.

1:26:14.586 --> 1:26:16.211
She's quite wonderful.

1:26:17.922 --> 1:26:19.840
No training, no craft to speak of.

1:26:20.008 --> 1:26:22.551
No guile, just pure instinct.
She's astonishing.

1:26:22.719 --> 1:26:26.388
- You should tell her that.
- Oh, I will. But she won't believe me.

1:26:26.556 --> 1:26:28.932
President Taft.

1:26:29.100 --> 1:26:31.226
It's probably
what makes her great.

1:26:32.270 --> 1:26:35.522
It's almost certainly what
makes her so profoundly unhappy.

1:26:35.690 --> 1:26:39.401
Oh, Miss Marina,
won't you have some champagne?

1:26:39.569 --> 1:26:42.946
Oh, I don't know, Your Grand Ducal.
You really think I ought?

1:26:43.114 --> 1:26:45.616
I tried my best to change her,

1:26:45.783 --> 1:26:48.911
but she remains brilliant, despite me.

1:26:49.078 --> 1:26:54.249
Maybe just up to... Ah!

1:26:54.792 --> 1:26:56.960
Do you know, I think directing a movie

1:26:57.128 --> 1:26:59.546
has to be just about
the best job ever invented.

1:27:00.548 --> 1:27:02.716
But Marilyn's cured me
of ever wanting to do it again.

1:27:02.884 --> 1:27:05.344
Well, now I'm back to the theater.

1:27:05.511 --> 1:27:07.262
John Osborne's writing a piece for me.

1:27:07.430 --> 1:27:10.682
Sir, I thought you hated
all that Royal Court stuff.

1:27:10.850 --> 1:27:13.810
Well, Miller made me see
things a little differently.

1:27:16.648 --> 1:27:18.148
Thank you, Colin, for all your help.

1:27:26.866 --> 1:27:28.700
Glad you ran away to the circus?

1:27:37.502 --> 1:27:39.795
My dear.

1:27:39.963 --> 1:27:42.422
Uh... ow.

1:27:42.590 --> 1:27:46.093
I've got a solemn word
of warning for you.

1:27:46.261 --> 1:27:47.844
What is that, my beloved?

1:27:49.305 --> 1:27:51.223
You know what's going to happen.

1:27:52.934 --> 1:27:55.435
I'm going to fall in love with you.

1:27:57.689 --> 1:27:59.773
I'm going to fall in love with you

1:27:59.941 --> 1:28:03.068
because I always, always do.

1:28:24.090 --> 1:28:26.550
There you go.

1:28:42.984 --> 1:28:44.943
Buy a girl a drink?

1:28:47.697 --> 1:28:49.698
I'll get another one
of those, please, Barry.

1:28:53.411 --> 1:28:55.746
I wasn't going to leave
without saying goodbye.

1:28:57.623 --> 1:28:59.082
Don't forget me.

1:29:02.253 --> 1:29:03.545
As if I could.

1:29:03.713 --> 1:29:06.590
Everybody else on the picture
wishes they could.

1:29:06.758 --> 1:29:08.675
They don't understand you.

1:29:12.138 --> 1:29:13.889
Walk me to my car?

1:29:17.310 --> 1:29:18.685
Nice place you got here.

1:29:50.468 --> 1:29:52.135
Thanks for being on my side.

1:30:01.854 --> 1:30:04.981
Looking a couple of inches taller
than when I first saw you.

1:30:11.572 --> 1:30:15.242
Here's what I remember most:
her embrace.

1:30:16.369 --> 1:30:18.203
Her belief in me.

1:30:18.371 --> 1:30:21.748
And the joy she gave.
That was her gift.

1:30:23.334 --> 1:30:26.962
When I think of her now, I think
of that time when a dream came true.

1:30:27.755 --> 1:30:31.383
And my only talent
was not to close my eyes.
