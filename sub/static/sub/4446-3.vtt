WEBVTT

00:01.310 --> 00:02.610
I just don't trust Murphy, okay?

00:02.644 --> 00:03.711
There's something wrong with that dude.

00:03.746 --> 00:04.545
What if it's true?

00:04.580 --> 00:05.546
What if Murphy's who they say he is

00:05.580 --> 00:06.848
and there's a chance for a vaccine?

00:06.882 --> 00:07.882
It's not.

00:07.916 --> 00:08.783
It's a lie,
and it's gonna get us both killed.

00:08.817 --> 00:10.385
Well then I'd rather die believing in a lie

00:10.419 --> 00:12.353
than live believing in nothing.

00:12.855 --> 00:15.189
Why would somebody lock you in
a cage and leave you to die?

00:15.224 --> 00:16.657
I don't have to justify myself.

00:16.692 --> 00:18.192
Maybe you do!

00:18.227 --> 00:23.331
What happens when I tell them what you are?

00:23.465 --> 00:24.465
Coward!

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:45.220 --> 00:46.621
So...

00:46.655 --> 00:49.223
What brings you to Philly, baby?

00:52.461 --> 00:55.430
Looking to do a little bartering.

00:55.464 --> 00:57.298
Your name really Sunshine?

01:01.970 --> 01:03.704
Does it mater?

01:03.739 --> 01:04.739
I guess not.

01:04.739 --> 01:07.275
It has been a long time

01:09.745 --> 01:12.380
since I saw a woman's body.

01:16.084 --> 01:18.453
At least a living woman.

01:19.688 --> 01:21.656
You're shaking.

01:21.690 --> 01:25.293
It's nothing, baby. Just the cold.

01:25.327 --> 01:29.597
Well let's see if we can warm you up.

01:29.631 --> 01:31.933
Are you forgetting something, lover?

01:31.967 --> 01:33.601
Right.

01:41.410 --> 01:45.046
And there's plenty more
where that came from.

01:45.080 --> 01:47.281
Let's do this.

02:11.907 --> 02:13.207
Crazy bitch!

02:13.242 --> 02:14.909
You trying to rip me off?

02:14.943 --> 02:15.943
I'll teach you.

02:19.047 --> 02:22.116
Thought I told you no rough stuff?

02:22.150 --> 02:23.885
You picked the wrong mark.

02:41.670 --> 02:43.104
Some people just don't listen.

02:51.113 --> 02:52.847
Go check his jacket.

02:56.385 --> 02:58.052
Somebody likes to party.

02:58.086 --> 02:59.253
Give me that.

02:59.288 --> 03:01.489
Make sure he doesn't have any weapons.

03:01.523 --> 03:02.790
And what happened to you?

03:02.824 --> 03:04.492
You forget everything I taught you?

03:04.526 --> 03:06.327
I tried to do it exactly
like you showed me,

03:06.361 --> 03:07.562
but he was too strong.

03:07.596 --> 03:09.764
I'll do it better next time. I promise.

03:09.798 --> 03:11.332
You can't be afraid.

03:11.366 --> 03:14.168
Hesitation will get you killed.

03:14.202 --> 03:15.970
You know I love you, Sunshine.

03:16.004 --> 03:19.040
Like I love all my children.

03:19.074 --> 03:22.677
Give me your hand.

03:33.121 --> 03:35.590
Why are we going this way?
Philly's a dead zone.

03:35.624 --> 03:37.425
Hopefully we can scavenge something

03:37.459 --> 03:39.727
without going too deep into the city.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.462
If we find a working radio,

03:41.496 --> 03:43.664
we can try to contact that Z guy again.

03:44.166 --> 03:45.866
Philadelphia.

03:45.901 --> 03:48.169
Ah, the city of brotherly love.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.981
Is that what I think it is?

04:00.549 --> 04:02.383
No way.

04:04.620 --> 04:06.253
Is that really the Liberty Bell?

04:06.288 --> 04:10.324
"Proclaim liberty throughout all the land
and unto all the inhabitants thereof."

04:10.359 --> 04:11.626
Yeah, that's it.

04:11.660 --> 04:13.160
Three years of zombie apocalypse,

04:13.195 --> 04:14.762
you think you've seen everything.

04:14.796 --> 04:15.896
Well when everything went bad,

04:15.931 --> 04:17.865
they probably tried to
save a little history.

04:17.899 --> 04:19.033
Yeah, well they should've known

04:19.067 --> 04:21.067
the only thing you can save is yourself.

04:21.103 --> 04:22.470
Let's go!

04:22.504 --> 04:24.405
Hang on.

04:24.439 --> 04:27.108
If this thing still has
fuel, and it does...

04:27.142 --> 04:28.209
If we get this thing started,

04:28.243 --> 04:29.610
they won't have to ride
out in the open like that.

04:29.645 --> 04:31.412
Well I'm all for that.

04:31.446 --> 04:33.314
I'll grab the jumper cable.

04:33.348 --> 04:35.916
God bless the human race.

04:35.951 --> 04:37.418
99% of them dead.

04:37.452 --> 04:41.255
But there's still one jackass
alive with a spray can.

04:46.895 --> 04:48.896
One thousand seventy-five.

04:53.835 --> 04:55.603
Okay, give it a shot.

04:56.571 --> 04:57.905
All right, that's it. Let's go, Murphy.

04:57.939 --> 04:59.106
You get in here with Warren and me.

04:59.141 --> 05:00.941
Everybody else, follow in the pickup.

05:00.976 --> 05:02.176
Stay close.

05:14.741 --> 05:16.341
You know you could try to
miss some of them instead.

05:16.376 --> 05:17.876
Why? One less zombie to kill.

05:17.911 --> 05:19.778
Leave some for Psycho-Boy Two Thousand.

05:19.813 --> 05:20.712
- Ten Thousand.
- Ten Thousand.

05:20.747 --> 05:21.814
Ten Thousand?

05:21.848 --> 05:24.383
It's good to know kids
today still have some goals.

05:26.085 --> 05:28.287
We're not really going
all the way to California

05:28.321 --> 05:29.721
with this Murphy guy, are we?

05:29.756 --> 05:30.856
That's the plan.

05:30.890 --> 05:33.258
That's crazy.

05:33.293 --> 05:35.194
What's so special about him anyway?

05:35.228 --> 05:36.995
His blood.

05:40.500 --> 05:42.301
Hey, take it easy there.
That's the last of your water.

05:42.335 --> 05:43.535
Actually it's the last of her water.

05:43.570 --> 05:44.770
Mine's right here.

05:44.804 --> 05:46.071
Give me that.

05:46.105 --> 05:48.373
Just because we got to get
you to California alive

05:48.408 --> 05:52.010
doesn't mean I can't kick your
ass between here and there.

05:52.045 --> 05:53.045
Look out!

05:56.583 --> 05:57.583
D!

06:10.597 --> 06:13.765
Yeah! I'd pay money to see that again.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.734
The axel's broke.

06:16.336 --> 06:19.271
All right, everybody get into that truck.

06:19.305 --> 06:20.973
Let's go, Murphy. Come on.

06:21.007 --> 06:23.408
Get out. I'm driving.

06:55.074 --> 06:57.042
Lookin' good, eh pup?

06:57.076 --> 07:00.379
Two twenty ounce T-bone
steaks aged to perfection.

07:01.681 --> 07:02.681
What's that?

07:04.717 --> 07:06.318
You like yours rare?

07:06.352 --> 07:08.754
Well me too. We've got that in common.

07:08.788 --> 07:10.589
Oh and there's plenty
more where this came from.

07:10.623 --> 07:12.357
Half a ton to be exact.

07:12.392 --> 07:14.026
And that's just the T-bones.

07:14.060 --> 07:16.929
We got New York strips, sirloins,

07:16.963 --> 07:19.331
and even some filet mignon.

07:19.365 --> 07:22.801
Between that and MREs to feed
a division for six months

07:22.835 --> 07:25.370
I'd say you and I are gonna
be the only two getting fat

07:25.405 --> 07:27.372
for the apocalypse.

07:29.509 --> 07:31.209
Here you go.

07:31.844 --> 07:33.412
Enjoy that beef.

07:33.446 --> 07:35.847
There are people out there
that'd kill for that steak.

07:35.882 --> 07:38.550
It's a dog eat dog world out there, man.

07:38.585 --> 07:39.718
Oh, sorry.

07:39.752 --> 07:46.224
Wrong word choice.
It's more of a zombie eat man world.

08:02.075 --> 08:04.109
As we share in the fruit of our labor,

08:04.143 --> 08:08.680
let it remind us now more than
ever that we need each other.

08:08.715 --> 08:11.917
We need family.

08:14.821 --> 08:16.321
As I led us through Black Summer,

08:16.356 --> 08:17.656
you all had doubts.

08:17.690 --> 08:18.624
Even I did.

08:18.658 --> 08:20.292
But we pulled together as a family

08:20.326 --> 08:22.861
and did what we had to do.

08:22.895 --> 08:27.032
Millions died starving in
the streets like animals.

08:27.066 --> 08:31.370
But we survived. We survived as a family.

08:31.404 --> 08:35.140
Our beautiful mother showed us the way.

08:35.174 --> 08:39.611
Taught us what it meant to be a family.

08:47.787 --> 08:50.555
But there is a hole in my heart.

08:50.590 --> 08:55.293
A hole in this family.
Our Sunshine is missing.

08:55.328 --> 09:00.065
And until she returns to us
our family's not complete.

09:00.099 --> 09:04.269
The circle that keeps us safe is broken.

09:07.273 --> 09:08.273
Amen.

09:08.608 --> 09:10.008
Amen.

09:34.967 --> 09:36.201
Excellent.

09:36.235 --> 09:40.539
Get yourself an extra serving.
You did good.

09:40.573 --> 09:42.040
Good news, everyone.

09:42.075 --> 09:46.745
Sunshine has been found.
The circle will not be broken.

10:00.193 --> 10:01.727
Enjoy. That's the last of the food.

10:04.597 --> 10:09.901
God, I'm so hungry my big guts
are eating my little guts.

10:09.936 --> 10:11.670
You gonna eat all of that?

10:14.107 --> 10:15.741
Selfish little bastard.

10:15.842 --> 10:18.176
We need to split up and
look for food and water.

10:18.211 --> 10:20.782
Oh, if we can find a two way radio or

10:20.882 --> 10:24.846
even like a satelite dish, I can
trying contact that Citizen Z guy.

10:24.880 --> 10:26.748
That's good. Okay, you and Mack do that.

10:26.782 --> 10:28.350
And the rest of us will look for food.

10:28.384 --> 10:29.851
Doc, you take Cassandra and 10K.

10:29.885 --> 10:33.521
Warren and I will take Murphy. Stay close.

10:33.556 --> 10:35.957
Meet back here in an hour.

10:35.992 --> 10:37.759
All right, let's go.

10:57.929 --> 10:59.396
I want that radio.

10:59.430 --> 11:01.031
Yeah, what about Officer Zombie?

11:02.100 --> 11:03.667
Umm.

11:03.701 --> 11:06.903
Do you remember that time in Peekskill?

11:07.905 --> 11:10.006
Yeah, that's perfect. Top or bottom?

11:10.041 --> 11:11.675
Top.

11:21.352 --> 11:24.654
Hey, you. Yeah.

11:27.158 --> 11:28.825
Oh, baby.

11:28.860 --> 11:30.360
You know if I ever need mercy,

11:30.394 --> 11:32.229
I really hope it's you.

11:32.263 --> 11:34.464
Come on. I want to see if that radio works.

11:34.499 --> 11:38.602
All right, hurry up. I'll pike some locals.

11:48.012 --> 11:50.480
Jesus Christ.

11:52.316 --> 11:54.117
Okay.

12:18.543 --> 12:20.677
Okay.

12:28.452 --> 12:29.252
Hey, kid.

12:29.287 --> 12:30.887
Give me a hand with this, will ya?

12:31.923 --> 12:34.291
I don't know why we stopped here in Philly.

12:34.325 --> 12:35.659
We should've kept going.

12:35.693 --> 12:36.993
Going where?

12:37.028 --> 12:39.696
We need to find a way to
communicate with that Citizen dude.

12:39.730 --> 12:42.599
And I think Addy can do
something with this dish.

12:42.633 --> 12:46.069
Who knows,
maybe we'll get lucky and pick up porn.

12:46.103 --> 12:47.170
Never seen porn.

12:47.205 --> 12:49.239
You never seen porn?

12:49.273 --> 12:51.775
Really? Never?

12:51.809 --> 12:53.577
Before my time.

12:53.611 --> 12:56.279
Is it good?

12:56.314 --> 12:58.582
- Yeah.
- Meh.

13:33.551 --> 13:35.418
Sunshine!

13:53.938 --> 13:54.771
Wow.

13:54.805 --> 13:56.273
That even disgusted me.

13:56.307 --> 13:58.275
'Course I'm the only one here to disgust.

13:58.309 --> 13:59.142
Except for you.

13:59.176 --> 14:01.211
But you're a dog. What do you care?

14:08.552 --> 14:10.387
Sorry.

14:15.026 --> 14:16.293
Where's my Sunshine?

14:16.327 --> 14:17.794
Bitch gave me the slip.

14:18.763 --> 14:21.097
That's your sister you're talking about.

14:21.132 --> 14:23.266
We'll find her soon enough.

14:23.301 --> 14:26.303
Meanwhile,
another opportunity has presented itself.

14:34.679 --> 14:36.079
Mayday. Mayday.

14:36.113 --> 14:37.747
Calling anybody on this frequency.

14:39.884 --> 14:42.786
Picking up some kind of RF
signal out of Philadelphia.

14:42.820 --> 14:44.955
Looks like something on the police band.

14:44.989 --> 14:47.791
Mayday.
Mayday. This is Addison Carver

14:47.825 --> 14:49.759
with Delta-Xray-Delta.

14:49.794 --> 14:52.729
Trying to contact Citizen Z. Come in,
Citizen Z.

14:52.763 --> 14:53.930
Mayday. Mayday.

14:53.965 --> 14:57.200
Delta-Xray-Delta,
this is Citizen Z. Do you copy? Over.

14:57.234 --> 15:00.370
I'm picking you up loud and clear.
Do you copy me?

15:00.404 --> 15:04.341
Copy you loud and clear Citizen Z.

15:08.746 --> 15:11.715
Delta-Xray-Delta, come in.

15:11.749 --> 15:14.351
Delta-Xray-Delta, what is your status?

15:23.227 --> 15:24.060
Delta-Xray-Delta.

15:24.095 --> 15:25.328
What is your status?

15:28.699 --> 15:30.133
Delta-Xray.

15:30.167 --> 15:32.035
Anybody. Are you all right?

15:32.069 --> 15:33.470
What is your status, Delta-Xray?

15:40.915 --> 15:43.183
Hey, what's going on down there?

15:43.218 --> 15:44.685
Is the package safe?

15:44.719 --> 15:48.589
Repeat, is the package safe? Do you copy?

15:48.623 --> 15:49.723
Please respond.

15:49.757 --> 15:52.960
If you're alive, please respond.

15:52.994 --> 15:55.863
Addy? Addy Carver, do you copy?

15:57.632 --> 16:00.033
All right.

16:00.068 --> 16:01.268
Let's go old school here

16:01.302 --> 16:04.972
and see we n triangulate
where that signal came from.

16:05.006 --> 16:08.442
What assets are hot in Philadelphia?

16:10.245 --> 16:13.280
Signal frequency looks like...
the police band.

16:13.314 --> 16:15.349
There can't be any cops left in Philly.

16:15.383 --> 16:19.119
It's been a dead zone for like two years.

16:19.153 --> 16:21.722
Maybe they hot-wired a cop's walkie.

16:21.756 --> 16:26.360
I miss the ol' days before
Edward Snowden... and zombies.

16:26.394 --> 16:28.629
We were such badasses.

16:31.566 --> 16:35.202
Addy, did it work? Addy? Addy!

16:35.236 --> 16:38.071
Addy! Where are you?

16:38.106 --> 16:40.541
Oh Jesus, baby. Baby, no, no, no, no, no!

16:44.612 --> 16:45.612
Addy.

16:45.914 --> 16:46.680
Addy.

16:46.714 --> 16:47.714
Addy.

16:49.317 --> 16:50.450
You're not Addy.

16:52.854 --> 16:54.655
Where is she?

16:54.689 --> 16:56.423
Addy!

16:56.691 --> 17:00.093
Delta-Xray-Delta.
Delta-Xray-Delta, come in.

17:00.128 --> 17:00.861
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:00.895 --> 17:01.895
We're here. We're here.

17:01.896 --> 17:03.030
Delta-X whatever, we copy.

17:03.064 --> 17:04.196
Gotcha, Delta-Xray.

17:04.232 --> 17:05.531
Who am I speaking to?

17:05.567 --> 17:06.767
Mack Thompson,
but that doesn't matter right now.

17:06.800 --> 17:08.560
There was a woman here.
Did you talk to her?

17:08.569 --> 17:12.138
Roger that.
I made contact with someone named... Addy?

17:12.173 --> 17:14.942
Yeah, Addy! Addy, yeah.
Yeah, you talked to her, okay.

17:14.976 --> 17:15.976
Is she okay?

17:15.977 --> 17:17.477
Did she...
did she tell you where she was going?

17:17.512 --> 17:18.679
Negative on her location.

17:18.713 --> 17:20.714
We only talked for like a second.

17:20.748 --> 17:22.082
Something happened.

17:22.116 --> 17:23.183
Goddamn Zs.

17:23.217 --> 17:25.852
Maybe not. I heard voices. Human voices.

17:25.887 --> 17:27.020
And then some sort of struggle.

17:27.055 --> 17:27.820
Humans?

17:27.855 --> 17:29.690
Roger that.

17:29.724 --> 17:31.091
Goddamn humans?

17:31.125 --> 17:32.492
What about the package?

17:32.527 --> 17:33.527
What package?

17:33.561 --> 17:35.829
Murphy. Patient Zero.

17:35.863 --> 17:37.864
Operation Bite Mark. Is he still alive?

17:37.899 --> 17:39.466
Yeah, weasel breath, he's fine.

17:39.500 --> 17:41.268
He was, he was alive an hour ago at least.

17:41.302 --> 17:42.369
Okay, listen.

17:42.403 --> 17:44.237
I need you... Got to run.

17:44.639 --> 17:45.639
Wait!

17:47.375 --> 17:50.644
Delta-Xray... Delta-Xray.

17:58.987 --> 18:01.755
Delta-Xray.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.690
Damn it.

18:03.725 --> 18:06.226
I can't take much more of this.

18:21.542 --> 18:23.176
It's okay. You're safe now.

18:23.211 --> 18:25.746
You're safe. No one's going to harm you.

18:27.882 --> 18:29.583
Touch me and I'll kill you.

18:29.617 --> 18:32.619
Sweet child.
That won't be necessary.

18:32.654 --> 18:35.288
Please, the last thing
we want is to harm you.

18:35.323 --> 18:36.723
My friends are looking for me,

18:36.758 --> 18:37.924
and when they find me they will kill you.

18:37.959 --> 18:40.027
They will kill all of you!

18:40.061 --> 18:40.761
I get it.

18:40.795 --> 18:41.928
You don't trust me.

18:41.963 --> 18:44.264
Why should you?
I know you're not ready to hear this,

18:44.298 --> 18:47.367
but I'm going to say it anyway. I'm sorry.

18:47.402 --> 18:50.837
Who are you? What do you want with me?

18:50.872 --> 18:52.039
Fair questions.

18:52.073 --> 18:54.574
I'd be angry too if I were
brought here against my will.

18:54.609 --> 18:57.744
Please, I don't want you to be afraid.

19:05.186 --> 19:09.356
I... I must apologize about
my overzealous companions.

19:09.390 --> 19:10.724
They're good men,

19:10.758 --> 19:14.394
but sometimes we have to resort
to less than civilized means.

19:14.429 --> 19:16.129
We live in a less than civilized world.

19:16.164 --> 19:17.531
You know it. I know it.

19:17.565 --> 19:20.467
So... when we encounter strangers

19:20.501 --> 19:24.705
the family needs to take...
necessary precautions.

19:24.739 --> 19:25.739
What family?

19:25.773 --> 19:26.673
Ours.

19:26.708 --> 19:28.608
This is our home.

19:28.643 --> 19:31.611
And I am responsible for their well-being.

19:31.646 --> 19:33.447
I'm Tobias Campbell.

19:33.481 --> 19:37.317
I guess you can say I'm like
a father to our little family.

19:37.351 --> 19:40.353
But like a family,
we take care of one another.

19:40.388 --> 19:43.690
Everyone contributes. Everyone benefits.

19:43.725 --> 19:45.492
It's how we've survived
the last three years.

19:45.526 --> 19:47.027
It's the only way we'll
survive in the future.

19:47.061 --> 19:50.864
Don't you agree?

19:50.898 --> 19:53.166
You must be hungry. Please eat.

19:53.201 --> 19:54.801
We have plenty to share.

19:56.270 --> 19:58.271
I'm not hungry.

19:58.306 --> 20:00.140
You will be.

20:00.174 --> 20:03.977
Until then,
why don't you go with Moonshade and Stormy.

20:04.011 --> 20:05.212
Ladies

20:05.246 --> 20:07.647
be so kind as to find some fresh
clothes for our newest member.

20:07.682 --> 20:11.284
I didn't say anything about joining your...
family.

20:11.319 --> 20:12.619
Oh, I'm sorry.

20:12.653 --> 20:14.521
I don't mean to be presumptuous.

20:14.555 --> 20:16.490
It's just that once people see

20:16.524 --> 20:18.625
the love and bounty that we share

20:18.659 --> 20:20.761
they never want to leave us.

20:20.795 --> 20:22.863
Ladies?

20:35.977 --> 20:38.712
Wait, so this Rocky dude loses the fight?

20:38.746 --> 20:42.549
Yeah. Yeah, but see in losing, he wins.

20:42.583 --> 20:44.217
It's very zen.

20:44.252 --> 20:46.019
I'd like to see Rocky fight a Z.

20:46.053 --> 20:47.354
If he loses, he gets eaten.

20:50.091 --> 20:51.124
Hey, is everything okay?

20:51.159 --> 20:51.992
Fine.

20:52.026 --> 20:53.860
It's about time.

20:55.696 --> 20:57.964
What's wrong? Where's Addy?

20:57.999 --> 20:59.866
Missing.

20:59.901 --> 21:00.567
Is she...?

21:00.601 --> 21:04.237
No. Taken alive.

21:04.272 --> 21:05.038
What?

21:05.072 --> 21:06.173
By humans.

21:06.207 --> 21:07.808
Who?

21:07.842 --> 21:09.810
We thought you might know.

21:09.844 --> 21:12.879
Me? Why would I know?

21:12.914 --> 21:14.481
You recognize these guys?

21:14.515 --> 21:15.682
No. Why would I?

21:15.716 --> 21:18.585
Creep on the left was one of
those two bikers back in Jersey.

21:18.619 --> 21:19.920
With your friend Travis.

21:19.954 --> 21:21.388
I told you, I didn't know that guy.

21:21.422 --> 21:22.823
And I don't know them either.

21:22.857 --> 21:25.826
You are gonna start telling
me the truth right now

21:25.860 --> 21:28.195
or I am going to start blowing holes

21:28.229 --> 21:29.596
- Mack.
- In you until you do.

21:29.630 --> 21:31.231
- Mack.
- Do you understand me?

21:31.265 --> 21:34.534
Mack. Put the gun away. Put the gun away.

21:34.569 --> 21:36.536
You're gonna tell us everything
you know about these guys

21:36.571 --> 21:38.338
right now.

21:38.372 --> 21:42.409
Or I'll shoot you.

21:42.443 --> 21:43.810
I can't go back!

21:43.845 --> 21:44.778
Back where?

21:44.812 --> 21:48.248
Where? Where? Where is she?! Where is she?!

21:50.918 --> 21:51.985
Shoot.

22:04.765 --> 22:06.666
You look beautiful.

22:06.701 --> 22:11.171
I look like a post-apocalyptic stripper.
Jesus.

22:11.205 --> 22:14.140
More like bait.

22:14.175 --> 22:16.042
Look at you.

22:16.077 --> 22:18.311
Mother will be so pleased.

22:18.346 --> 22:20.313
Supper will be ready soon.

22:20.348 --> 22:21.681
Set the table.

22:21.716 --> 22:26.887
And set a place of honor for
our guest next to Mother.

22:26.921 --> 22:29.155
Where are you Mack?

22:38.766 --> 22:39.666
Enough!

22:39.700 --> 22:41.434
All right, Cassandra! No more bullshit.

22:41.469 --> 22:43.236
Tell us what you know. Now!

22:43.271 --> 22:45.739
All right. I know them.

22:45.773 --> 22:50.277
They're part of a group of survivors.
A family of sorts.

22:50.311 --> 22:52.445
But more like a cult actually.

22:52.480 --> 22:54.014
Led by a man named Tobias Campbell.

22:54.048 --> 22:56.683
I can't go back there. I won't go back.

22:56.717 --> 22:58.618
You'll do whatever
the hell we need you to do

22:58.653 --> 22:59.653
to get Addy back!

22:59.687 --> 23:01.421
You don't know these people.
They're dangerous.

23:01.455 --> 23:02.689
So are we.

23:02.723 --> 23:07.661
Not like they are.
Tobias and the others are worse than Zs.

23:07.695 --> 23:09.663
I thought I'd gotten away from them,

23:09.697 --> 23:11.665
but then Travis spotted me with you.

23:11.699 --> 23:13.199
Why are you so afraid of them?

23:13.234 --> 23:14.801
You don't get it.

23:14.835 --> 23:17.904
You don't pick who you survive with.

23:17.939 --> 23:19.973
At first I thought I was lucky.

23:20.007 --> 23:23.910
They started out like everybody else.

23:23.945 --> 23:28.181
Tobias was smart.
He was strong. He saved us.

23:28.215 --> 23:32.218
But then Black Summer came,
and everything went to hell.

23:32.253 --> 23:34.087
Somewhere along the way he lost his mind,

23:34.121 --> 23:37.724
and... and we lost our souls.
And I am not going back there!

23:37.758 --> 23:39.960
What are they gonna do to Addy?

23:42.797 --> 23:45.065
Tobias has this weird control over people.

23:45.099 --> 23:46.666
He can make you do terrible things.

23:46.701 --> 23:48.868
What do you mean? Rape?

23:48.903 --> 23:50.870
No, he'll use her as bait.

23:50.905 --> 23:52.439
Bait? What, do they rob people?

23:52.473 --> 23:53.306
Not just rob.

23:53.341 --> 23:54.074
Murder them?!

23:54.108 --> 23:56.876
No! Not rape. Not murder.

23:56.911 --> 24:01.681
They don't just kill
their victims. It's worse.

25:36.544 --> 25:39.913
Oh God! Oh no! Oh God! Oh no! No!

25:47.221 --> 25:49.289
Supper's ready!

25:56.244 --> 25:58.245
There was this farmer.

25:58.279 --> 26:00.447
Had the smartest pig in the world, Arnold.

26:00.481 --> 26:02.282
This pig could read and do math.

26:02.317 --> 26:03.450
Arnold was famous.

26:03.484 --> 26:04.918
And then one day, the farmer's friend,

26:04.953 --> 26:07.788
he comes over and he sees Arnold
tripping around on three legs.

26:07.822 --> 26:10.891
And he says to the farmer, 'hey,
what happened to poor Arnold?'

26:10.925 --> 26:12.059
And the farmer says

26:12.093 --> 26:14.795
"Smart pig like that,
you don't eat him all at once."

26:21.836 --> 26:25.005
Oh, what? Too soon?

26:26.641 --> 26:29.109
We didn't start out as cannibals.

26:29.143 --> 26:31.311
Cannibals? How is that even possible?

26:31.346 --> 26:33.146
Everything's infected
with the zombie virus.

26:33.181 --> 26:36.650
If you kill it and eat it,
you get the live virus.

26:36.684 --> 26:39.252
But if you eat it alive...

26:39.287 --> 26:41.655
We were people just trying to survive.

26:41.689 --> 26:43.657
Tobias saved me. First from the Zs.

26:43.691 --> 26:45.659
Then from the worst of humanity.

26:45.693 --> 26:49.863
He was a good man. Then his wife got sick.

26:51.566 --> 26:53.633
She just couldn't take it anymore.

26:53.668 --> 26:55.802
And he was never the same after that.

26:56.838 --> 26:58.238
When Black Summer came

26:58.272 --> 27:00.674
and everyone else in the world was starving

27:00.708 --> 27:03.410
he swore he would do whatever
it took to keep us alive.

27:03.444 --> 27:04.277
And he did.

27:04.312 --> 27:05.178
I'm going back for Addy.

27:05.213 --> 27:05.879
Hang on, Mack.

27:05.913 --> 27:07.414
Garnett, do not try to stop me.

27:07.448 --> 27:09.950
Nobody's gonna tryo stop you.
We're all going back.

27:09.984 --> 27:11.051
We just need a plan.

27:11.085 --> 27:14.021
You don't understand!
These people are worse than Zs!

27:14.055 --> 27:15.222
They'll kill all of you!

27:15.256 --> 27:17.491
Yeah, she's right.
We need to look at the big picture.

27:17.525 --> 27:18.859
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

27:20.628 --> 27:22.462
Do you know where they've taken her?

27:32.140 --> 27:34.241
I know you think we're monsters.

27:34.275 --> 27:37.577
In human. We all did too at first.

27:37.612 --> 27:42.182
But hunger
has a way of changing one's mind.

27:42.216 --> 27:43.717
Morality is stripped away.

27:43.751 --> 27:48.221
And all that remains is survival.

27:48.256 --> 27:50.490
I know, this takes some getting used to.

27:50.525 --> 27:53.813
Perhaps this will make it more palatable.

28:01.433 --> 28:02.466
Please, Little Flower.

28:02.501 --> 28:04.201
You must be starving.

28:04.236 --> 28:06.003
Just a bite to keep your strength.

28:06.037 --> 28:08.572
I made it special for you.

28:15.747 --> 28:18.682
Now you've upset Mama.

28:18.717 --> 28:21.051
I know this is a big adjustment.

28:21.086 --> 28:24.488
But in times like these,
it's eat or be eaten.

28:24.523 --> 28:29.727
So please. Mama likes you. Make her happy.

28:36.802 --> 28:38.302
Fresh meat.

28:38.336 --> 28:41.071
You two, get this meat back in the kitchen.

28:41.106 --> 28:43.574
Then get in position.

29:12.109 --> 29:13.910
Afternoon, friend.

29:13.945 --> 29:16.780
If it's female companionship
you're looking for,

29:16.814 --> 29:18.548
you've come to the right place.

29:18.583 --> 29:20.884
Actually I'm looking for my friend.

29:20.918 --> 29:22.052
Red head.

29:22.086 --> 29:24.154
Goes by the name of Addy.

29:24.188 --> 29:28.825
Addy? Addy? Don't know anybody named Addy.

29:28.860 --> 29:31.461
Sure would remember if we had one.

29:31.496 --> 29:36.600
Oh hey, how about the
lovely Moonshade or Stormy?

29:36.634 --> 29:38.768
We got a two for one special today.

29:38.803 --> 29:40.937
Listen, scumbag.

29:40.972 --> 29:42.906
I know you got her.

29:42.940 --> 29:44.574
You send her out here
in the next ten seconds

29:44.609 --> 29:46.710
or a lot of bad shit is
gonna start happening.

29:46.744 --> 29:49.479
Oooh, tough guy.

29:54.051 --> 29:55.352
That was a head shot.

29:55.386 --> 29:56.786
We showed your friend some mercy.

29:56.821 --> 29:57.954
I'm not gonna do the same for you.

29:57.989 --> 29:59.422
Next shot is going through your heart.

29:59.457 --> 30:01.825
So unless you want to be
prematurely zombified,

30:01.859 --> 30:04.361
you get my friend out here.

30:04.395 --> 30:05.061
Now.

30:05.096 --> 30:06.530
Not if I blow you away first.

30:06.564 --> 30:08.923
You're not gonna do that.
You're gonna get me Addy.

30:08.958 --> 30:11.359
And if you're quick about it, *****

30:11.393 --> 30:13.828
That won't be necessary.

30:13.863 --> 30:14.996
Garnett!

30:19.068 --> 30:23.538
Not yet. Not yet. Come on.

30:23.572 --> 30:26.040
Apparently you've been
talking to my little Sunshine.

30:26.075 --> 30:28.543
Garnett, get me out of here.
These people are insane.

30:28.577 --> 30:33.548
Say that again and I will eat your heart.

30:33.582 --> 30:35.917
Apparently we both have
something the other wants.

30:35.951 --> 30:38.119
Perhaps we can make a deal.

30:38.154 --> 30:41.156
Give me back my Sunshine,
and you can have your precious Addy.

30:41.190 --> 30:43.291
Nah, I'm not gonna
negotiate with a cannibal.

30:43.325 --> 30:46.261
You're gonna give me Addy.
We're gonna walk away.

30:46.295 --> 30:47.996
And you can eat anybody you want.

30:48.030 --> 30:51.032
You know the first rule of negotiation is

30:51.066 --> 30:53.868
the person who wants it least wins.

30:53.903 --> 30:56.838
If you harm her,
we'll kill every one of you.

30:56.872 --> 30:58.106
Kill away.

30:58.140 --> 31:01.609
Frankly I've had about all the
zombie apocalypse I can take.

31:01.644 --> 31:05.213
But of course,
you and the girl will be the first to die.

31:08.684 --> 31:11.486
That's what I thought.

31:11.520 --> 31:15.648
Do you know the second rule of negotiation?

31:15.683 --> 31:16.683
What?

31:20.954 --> 31:24.390
The guy with the 50
caliber machine gun wins.

31:30.864 --> 31:32.432
That didn't sound good.

31:33.634 --> 31:36.202
You gonna give me back my Sunshine?

31:36.236 --> 31:40.073
Or do we continue this
conversation in hell?

31:40.107 --> 31:41.341
- No, Mack.
- No, no, if we're going to hell,

31:41.375 --> 31:43.176
I'm going all the way and I'm
taking this bastard with me.

31:43.210 --> 31:43.776
Wait!

31:43.811 --> 31:44.510
What do you want?!

31:44.545 --> 31:45.545
I'll go.

31:50.551 --> 31:51.818
Stop!

31:54.888 --> 31:56.122
Let her go, Tobias.

31:58.559 --> 32:00.927
What are you doing?

32:00.961 --> 32:04.664
What I should have done in the first place.

32:05.699 --> 32:07.633
Let her go, and I'll come back.

32:07.668 --> 32:11.671
Don't do it. Kill them. Kill them all.

32:14.775 --> 32:15.508
No

32:15.542 --> 32:18.277
It's okay. It's okay.

32:28.422 --> 32:29.889
Come on.

32:34.862 --> 32:36.896
It's okay. It's okay, baby.

32:36.930 --> 32:39.298
It's okay. Come on. Let's go.

32:43.003 --> 32:44.637
My Sunshine.

32:52.378 --> 32:54.179
Hey, we about given up on you.

32:54.213 --> 32:57.749
I actually gave up on
you about an hour ago.

32:57.784 --> 33:00.685
Never thought I'd be happy
to see your sad ass again.

33:00.720 --> 33:02.954
Let's get out of here, guys. Now.

33:02.989 --> 33:04.556
Wait. What?

33:05.258 --> 33:06.258
Come on.

33:06.926 --> 33:10.328
We're not...
we're not leaving her there, are we?

33:12.465 --> 33:17.102
Addy. She lied to us.
It almost got you killed.

33:17.136 --> 33:17.803
We can't do that.

33:17.837 --> 33:19.971
We can't just leave her there.

33:20.740 --> 33:22.307
Come in the truck with me.

33:22.341 --> 33:23.909
We'll talk about this when you're safe.

33:23.943 --> 33:25.510
I am not going.

33:25.545 --> 33:26.545
Look, he's right.

33:26.546 --> 33:28.213
We almost all got killed
going back for you.

33:28.247 --> 33:31.316
Yeah, she's a freakin' cannibal,
and she got what she deserved.

33:31.350 --> 33:34.653
She did what she had to do to survive.

33:34.687 --> 33:37.489
And you of all people
would have done the same.

33:37.523 --> 33:38.990
Come on, Addy is right!

33:39.025 --> 33:41.860
We cannot leave her back there!

33:41.894 --> 33:44.429
You men don't know what it's like.

33:44.464 --> 33:47.632
What is this, a chick thing now?

33:47.667 --> 33:49.134
- Yes.
- Yes.

33:49.168 --> 33:50.528
All right, I want to help her too.

33:50.536 --> 33:52.537
But we're not gonna beat
a 50 caliber machine gun.

33:52.572 --> 33:56.675
It's gonna tear us to pieces
before we get to the fence.

33:56.709 --> 33:58.410
How good a shot are you?

34:03.549 --> 34:04.916
Pretty good.

34:04.951 --> 34:06.885
One thousand eighty-four.

34:06.919 --> 34:08.853
Oh yeah, and a half.

34:08.888 --> 34:11.489
Okay. I have an idea.

34:16.395 --> 34:18.897
Calling Northern Light.
Calling Northern Light.

34:18.931 --> 34:21.433
Come in, Northern Light. Do you copy? Over.

34:21.467 --> 34:23.134
Come in... Citizen whoever you are.

34:23.168 --> 34:25.971
This is Delta-Xray-Delta.
Where the hell are you? Come in. Over.

34:26.005 --> 34:27.205
This is Delta-Xray-Delta. Where the hell
are you? Come in. Over. I'm here.

34:27.239 --> 34:28.806
I'm here. Northern Light.

34:28.841 --> 34:32.010
Copy you Delta-Xray.

34:32.043 --> 34:34.713
Northern Light, we need your help.
Do you copy?

34:34.746 --> 34:36.214
We need your help.

34:36.248 --> 34:38.750
Copy that, ma'am. What can I do?

34:38.784 --> 34:40.018
We need music.

34:40.052 --> 34:43.522
I'm sorry. Say again.
It sounded like you said you needed music.

34:43.556 --> 34:44.556
That's a roger.

34:44.556 --> 34:47.192
Can you broadcast on the
AM frequency? Over.

34:47.226 --> 34:49.995
We're the NSA, ma'am.
Master of all frequencies.

34:50.029 --> 34:52.130
What would you like to hear?

34:52.164 --> 34:54.232
We need a diversion. Something loud.

34:54.266 --> 34:56.501
Something that'll make the Zs go crazy.

34:56.536 --> 35:00.038
Copy that and can do, ma'am.
I think I have just the thing.

35:00.072 --> 35:02.073
Give me five minutes and
look for my broadcast

35:02.108 --> 35:04.876
on the low end of the AM dial.

35:04.911 --> 35:05.944
Thanks, dude.

35:05.978 --> 35:07.612
Over.

35:09.148 --> 35:10.148
Hear that boy?

35:10.182 --> 35:11.216
They need us.

35:11.250 --> 35:13.285
Somebody actually needs us.

35:24.196 --> 35:28.500
Mama's so much happier when you're here.

35:28.601 --> 35:30.302
Got some fresh meat in trailer two

35:30.336 --> 35:32.571
looking for something exotic.

35:32.605 --> 35:34.606
You're on, Sunshine.

35:47.353 --> 35:50.121
Mmm. That's what I'm talkin' about.

35:51.891 --> 35:54.526
Twenty minutes and no rough stuff.

35:54.560 --> 35:56.428
Define rough stuff.

35:56.462 --> 35:59.197
Sunshine will let you know.

35:59.398 --> 36:01.866
Oooh, Sunshine.

36:03.703 --> 36:04.502
What are you doing?

36:04.537 --> 36:07.939
Shhh. The right thing.

36:07.974 --> 36:09.474
Just follow my lead.

36:09.942 --> 36:12.410
You know this is gonna get us all killed,
right?

36:12.445 --> 36:14.479
At least we're going out with some style.

36:14.513 --> 36:16.114
Crank it up!

36:19.452 --> 36:20.552
Here they come.

36:20.586 --> 36:23.021
If you got any prayers, now's the time.

36:37.103 --> 36:40.372
Oh! Oh! Yeah! Oh!

36:41.674 --> 36:43.441
- Oh yea baby!
- Oh my God!

36:43.476 --> 36:45.577
- Yeah, baby!
- Oh, you're so big!

36:45.611 --> 36:46.811
- Take it!
- Yes!

36:46.846 --> 36:49.280
- Love doctor in the house!
- Oh, doctor!

36:49.315 --> 36:51.750
<i>Oh yeah! Yeah, baby!</i>

36:51.784 --> 36:55.253
- <i>Oh yeah! - Ride it, baby!</i>
- What fool is playing music?

36:55.287 --> 36:56.755
- Oh! Oh!
- Yes!

36:56.789 --> 36:59.290
Listen. That's our signal.

36:59.325 --> 37:00.458
<i>Come on, baby! Oh! Oh!</i>

37:00.493 --> 37:02.961
Bernt, see if you can tell
where that music is coming from.

37:02.995 --> 37:05.864
Merchant,
get on the 50 caliber just in case.

37:05.898 --> 37:08.366
No! No! Don't!

37:08.401 --> 37:09.200
Oh!

37:09.235 --> 37:11.936
No! No! Ahhhhhhh!

37:11.971 --> 37:12.971
Now!

37:16.242 --> 37:17.676
Hey!

37:29.922 --> 37:31.523
Sunshine.

37:31.557 --> 37:33.058
My name is Cassandra!

37:38.197 --> 37:40.598
Let's go. Come on.

37:59.351 --> 38:00.719
Let's go! Let's go!

38:09.595 --> 38:11.696
Sunshine!

38:46.743 --> 38:48.744
It's now or never.

39:49.405 --> 39:50.872
My kinda town.

39:50.974 --> 39:53.776
If anybody asks,
we were nowhere near that bell.

39:53.810 --> 39:57.546
I always heard Philly was a tough town,
but sheesh.

39:57.580 --> 39:59.248
Zombies with attitude.

40:01.618 --> 40:04.820
Hope my peeps down in the
Philly area can hear this.

40:04.854 --> 40:07.923
Thought I'd spin some blues to travel by.

40:07.957 --> 40:11.060
And to anybody else out there
within the sound of my voice.

40:11.094 --> 40:12.628
I hope some slide guitar

40:12.662 --> 40:16.698
gets you through another messed
up day of death and destruction.

40:16.733 --> 40:18.773
Everybody out there,
whether you're hiding in a cave

40:18.802 --> 40:20.135
or running for your life,

40:20.170 --> 40:23.238
just keep doing what you
got to do to stay alive.

40:23.273 --> 40:26.208
Because in the end,
that's the only way we're gonna win

40:26.242 --> 40:28.377
this Zombie Apocalypse thing.

40:28.411 --> 40:32.047
Bash 'em, slash 'em,
bust 'em, and burn 'em.

40:32.082 --> 40:34.716
Whatever it takes. Just stay alive.

40:34.751 --> 40:35.984
No questions asked.
