00:14.181 --> 00:15.974
You forgot to buy milk.

00:15.974 --> 00:17.392
I notice you didn't forget
to buy yourself

00:17.392 --> 00:20.062
two new bottles of vodka
and a giant bag of weed.

00:20.062 --> 00:22.022

What?

00:29.863 --> 00:32.241

would suffice.

00:32.241 --> 00:33.909
‐ Hi, Mom.
What the [...]?

00:33.909 --> 00:36.787

you never change.

00:36.787 --> 00:38.664
‐ All right, okay,
could you please

00:38.664 --> 00:40.707
just cover yourself up
a little bit?

00:40.707 --> 00:43.085
‐ Why? Were you sizing up
my titties?

00:43.085 --> 00:45.379
‐ No!

00:45.379 --> 00:47.047
Are you they real?

00:47.047 --> 00:48.966
‐ Of course they're real!
They're au naturel.

00:48.966 --> 00:50.717
I mean, I'm 46,
and they're still

00:50.717 --> 00:52.469
standing up straight
on their own.

00:52.469 --> 00:53.762
That's pretty
impressive, right?

00:53.762 --> 00:56.431
‐ [grunts]
Oh, shit.

00:56.431 --> 00:58.850

on the floor?

00:58.850 --> 01:00.644
‐ Hey.

01:00.644 --> 01:02.521
I don't know.

01:02.521 --> 01:04.314
‐ I'll tell you what you're
doing on the floor, buddy.

01:04.314 --> 01:07.526
Last night I was riding you
harder than Seabiscuit

01:07.526 --> 01:08.902
running
into the final stretch,

01:08.902 --> 01:11.280
and I needed a place
to plant my feet.

01:11.280 --> 01:14.241
‐ That would explain
the carpet rash on my ass.

01:14.241 --> 01:16.118
‐ Oh, I think
I'm gonna throw up.

01:16.118 --> 01:18.787
‐ Hey, did you handcuff
my ankle to the bedpost?

01:18.787 --> 01:20.289
‐ Yes.

01:20.289 --> 01:22.165
You were being
a very naughty little horsey.

01:22.165 --> 01:24.126
‐ Okay, that's good for me.
I'm gonna go throw up now.

01:24.126 --> 01:26.420
‐ Okay, you do that.
Close the door on your way out.

You called her?

you were telling me,

like, you know, I need to act
more like an adult,

02:16.011 --> 02:17.971
and I thought,
you know what?

02:17.971 --> 02:19.765
Who's the one person
on this planet

02:19.765 --> 02:21.433
who cares more about Gigi
than I do?

02:21.433 --> 02:23.602
It's not Ava,
and it certainly isn't Flash.

02:23.602 --> 02:24.853
‐ Ppppt!
No, it's me.

02:24.853 --> 02:27.022
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ And‐‐mmm.

02:27.022 --> 02:28.565
Ooh.

02:28.565 --> 02:31.735
And no one loves you
more than I do, baby doll.

02:31.735 --> 02:33.779
‐ It sounds so sweet
when you say it like that.

02:33.779 --> 02:36.698
‐ Your mother has always had
your best interests at heart.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.575
That's true.
Always.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.869

on a regular basis

02:40.869 --> 02:43.413

went back to his wife

02:43.413 --> 02:44.831

02:46.166 --> 02:47.376

02:47.376 --> 02:48.752

02:48.752 --> 02:50.545
most kids would be
doing back flips

02:50.545 --> 02:53.048
if their estranged natural
parents got back together.

02:53.048 --> 02:54.508
‐ Okay, well, most kids
don't have to worry

02:54.508 --> 02:55.926
about what diabolical plan
their parents are making

02:55.926 --> 02:57.469
in bed together.

02:57.469 --> 02:59.262
‐ Okay, listen, the only plans
we have for you

02:59.262 --> 03:00.931
involve your career,
your future, okay?

03:00.931 --> 03:02.224
That's what we're planning.

03:02.224 --> 03:03.850
‐ That's bullshit.

03:03.850 --> 03:06.103
You guys are just trying
to make Ava and Flash jealous.

03:06.103 --> 03:08.063

of the equation anymore.

03:08.063 --> 03:09.523

03:20.158 --> 03:22.703
It's a toxic ball of egos
and insecurities,

03:22.703 --> 03:24.079
just like The Heathens were.

03:24.079 --> 03:25.956
‐ It's true.
I told your mom, I said,

03:25.956 --> 03:28.708
"Listen, why don't you put
your money where her mouth is?"

03:28.708 --> 03:30.710
Get this, she's gonna
bankroll a music video.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.337
A real music video.

03:32.337 --> 03:34.381

gonna splurge.

200 grand here.

03:36.508 --> 03:39.553
Real high‐end,
Lana Del Rey type shit.

03:39.553 --> 03:42.764
And I lined up this director
that worked with her, right?

03:42.764 --> 03:44.975
Played him some of your stuff,
and I am telling you

03:44.975 --> 03:46.351
he went bananas.

03:46.351 --> 03:47.436
‐ Nuts.
‐ He did?

03:47.436 --> 03:48.937
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ Yes, he did.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.397

03:50.397 --> 03:52.816

we are gonna have
record companies lining up

03:55.444 --> 03:57.821
to offer you huge deals,

03:57.821 --> 04:00.782
only we will be holding
the cards.

04:00.782 --> 04:02.617
‐ And since I can't be
in the same room

04:02.617 --> 04:04.286
with Flash anymore
to write songs,

04:04.286 --> 04:05.620
your mom has
generously offered

04:05.620 --> 04:07.414
to write songs
with me for you.

04:07.414 --> 04:10.292
‐ You know, we wrote "Babylon"
and "No Valentine" together

04:10.292 --> 04:12.085
back in the day.
‐ Yes, we did.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.588
And I believe we wrote both
of those songs together in bed.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.506

a quick "yes,"

04:56.797 --> 04:59.424

I do everything sitting down.

04:59.424 --> 05:02.010
When I pee, I like to be
in a state of repose.

05:02.010 --> 05:05.388

What is the gig?

05:05.388 --> 05:07.682
‐ Adele is playing
the Garden.

05:07.682 --> 05:09.643
‐ I love Adele.
‐ I know.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.311
She is amazing.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.647
All right,
I got this thing.

05:13.647 --> 05:17.192
I'm calling it
the Alpha Adele Arena Night.

05:17.192 --> 05:18.819
The Triple‐A Club.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.946
That's where I get
a bunch of guys

05:20.946 --> 05:23.406
who love Adele, right,
as much as me,

05:23.406 --> 05:25.784
and we go to the show
as a group.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.911
Maybe get some tapas
beforehand.

05:27.911 --> 05:30.580
After the show,
we go downtown, East Village,

05:30.580 --> 05:34.960

but Adele all night long.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.587

05:50.600 --> 05:52.644
‐ That's my new "Feast"
contract.

05:52.644 --> 05:55.272
People I invited to the show
work for Michael Flatley.

05:55.272 --> 05:56.773
‐ The Riverdance guy?

05:56.773 --> 05:58.525
‐ Yeah, he wants to come
out of retirement

05:58.525 --> 06:02.362
and take his own turn
at Irish potato famine,

06:02.362 --> 06:06.199
hip‐hop "Hamilton" rip‐off.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.909
‐ Who's gonna play Taryn?

06:07.909 --> 06:09.828
‐ Flatley.

06:09.828 --> 06:11.496
Only now they're
gonna call him "Sean,"

06:11.496 --> 06:14.583

a happy, tap dancey pirate

06:14.583 --> 06:19.754

and a bunch of sexy dancers.

06:19.754 --> 06:21.798

saying about this?

06:21.798 --> 06:23.383
‐ He took the buyout
in a second

06:23.383 --> 06:25.218
so that he could do
his own passion project.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.511

to say to me,

19:25.038 --> 19:26.039
you can say in the presence
of my father.

19:26.039 --> 19:27.415
‐ Yep.

19:27.415 --> 19:29.960
Anything professional,

19:29.960 --> 19:32.337
anything personal.

19:32.337 --> 19:34.172
‐ That's how it's gotta be.

19:34.172 --> 19:35.632
‐ Yep.

19:35.632 --> 19:37.926
That's how it's gonna be
from now on.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.263
‐ Johnny and Cat are
up to no good.

19:41.263 --> 19:43.056
‐ [sighs]
‐ You.

19:43.056 --> 19:46.351
‐ Listen, he's out for money.
She's out for blood.

19:46.351 --> 19:48.186
‐ You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

19:48.186 --> 19:49.896
‐ Okay, Cat shows up,

19:49.896 --> 19:51.982
starts spending all this time
with the band,

19:51.982 --> 19:55.527
writing songs with you,
donating songs to Ava X,

19:55.527 --> 19:58.196
like she gives a shit
about that project.

19:58.196 --> 20:01.533
You mark my words,
he's after her cash.

20:01.533 --> 20:06.079
She's out to break up
The Assassins and Ava X.

20:06.079 --> 20:08.915
And shame on you,
pimping out your daughter,

20:08.915 --> 20:11.418
you greedy son of a bitch.

20:11.418 --> 20:12.919
‐ No, no, no, no, no!

20:12.919 --> 20:15.297
No, God, stop!
No, no, no, no, no!

20:15.297 --> 20:16.798
You could break your hand
on his face.

20:16.798 --> 20:18.258
How you gonna play guitar
with a broken hand?

20:18.258 --> 20:20.468
‐ What about my face?
‐ No, uh‐uh, uh‐uh.

20:20.468 --> 20:21.928
No! No!
‐ Ow! Ow!

20:21.928 --> 20:23.638
‐ Stop it, stop it!
Stop, stop!

20:23.638 --> 20:25.348
‐ No, no, no.
‐ Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:25.348 --> 20:27.267
Ow! Ow!
He's biting me! He's biting!

20:27.267 --> 20:28.602
‐ Bite his arm,
not his hand!

20:28.602 --> 20:29.811
‐ What is going on?

20:29.811 --> 20:30.896
‐ Can you do something?
‐ Stop it!

20:30.896 --> 20:32.647
Why are you fighting
like that?

20:32.647 --> 20:34.441
Stop what you're doing
right now!

20:36.192 --> 20:38.570
What are you guys doing?
Stop it, break it up!

20:38.570 --> 20:40.030
‐ Dude.
‐ Come on, what are you doing?

20:40.030 --> 20:41.823
‐ Dudes, dudes!
‐ You gotta be kidding me.

20:41.823 --> 20:43.491
‐ No‐‐
‐ Are you serious?

20:43.491 --> 20:44.910
‐ Are you kidding me?
‐ No, I'm not kidding you!

20:44.910 --> 20:46.411
‐ Do not touch my‐‐
you big meatball.

20:46.411 --> 20:48.622
‐ Wahhh!
‐ What the hell?

20:48.622 --> 20:49.873
Dude, stop it.

20:49.873 --> 20:50.916
‐ Come on,
you want some of this?

20:50.916 --> 20:53.168
‐ Mother‐‐
‐ You want this?

20:53.168 --> 20:55.629
[overlapping shouting]

20:55.629 --> 20:58.340
‐ Hey, guys, come on!
Just stop it.

20:58.340 --> 21:00.508
Let go‐‐
‐ Get off him!

21:00.508 --> 21:03.219
‐ No, no, not her hair!
Not her hair or her face!

21:03.219 --> 21:05.221
[overlapping shouting]

21:08.516 --> 21:10.810
‐ My balls!
‐ [screaming]

21:10.810 --> 21:13.980
Get off me!
‐ Stop!

21:13.980 --> 21:15.315
Stop!

21:15.315 --> 21:16.775
Just stop!

21:16.775 --> 21:18.777
‐ Dude, look what you did
to my camera!

21:18.777 --> 21:21.029
Oh, my God,
it broke off the body.

21:21.029 --> 21:22.948
‐ That's what you get.

21:22.948 --> 21:23.990
‐ Stupid.

21:23.990 --> 21:26.618
‐ Everybody just chill!

21:26.618 --> 21:28.620
Okay, just chill
for a second.

21:28.620 --> 21:31.581
This is crazy, right?

21:31.581 --> 21:33.750
Here's what I think
we should do, okay?

21:33.750 --> 21:36.252
I think that we should
just take a second,

21:36.252 --> 21:38.088
take a deep breath,

21:38.088 --> 21:40.590
and I think that we should
take a couple days off, right?

21:40.590 --> 21:42.092
Get away a little bit,

21:42.092 --> 21:43.843
and maybe some of this anger

21:43.843 --> 21:46.554
and bitterness
and resentment

21:46.554 --> 21:50.934
can just kind of fade
to the background for a minute.

21:50.934 --> 21:52.018
Okay?

21:52.018 --> 21:53.561
Right?
What do you guys think?

21:53.561 --> 21:56.898
‐ Oh, my God, stop being
such a little bitch, Noah!

21:56.898 --> 22:01.820
Listen, what we should do is
get some studio time, right?

22:01.820 --> 22:04.990
We gotta take
all this crazy bullshit

22:04.990 --> 22:07.117
and turn it
into a couple of new songs.

22:07.117 --> 22:10.203
So I am gonna call
my friend Phil.

22:10.203 --> 22:12.497
I'm gonna see if there's
a couple days at his studio.

22:12.497 --> 22:15.291
And what do you think
about that, yea or nay?

22:18.545 --> 22:19.879
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah, that's a good idea.

22:19.879 --> 22:21.589
‐ Whatever, I'm always
up to play, yeah.

22:21.589 --> 22:22.966
‐ I'll do it.
‐ I'll do it.

22:22.966 --> 22:25.677
‐ Why not?
‐ Who cares? Why not?

22:25.677 --> 22:27.012
‐ Pick up your camera.

22:27.012 --> 22:28.513
‐ You're gonna have to pay
for this, kid.

22:28.513 --> 22:29.514
‐ I'm not paying for nothing.
‐ Asshole.

22:29.514 --> 22:30.932
‐ Yeah?

22:30.932 --> 22:32.100
‐ Yeah, you almost ripped
my new jacket.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.643
‐ Your jacket?
Look at my new blouse.

22:33.643 --> 22:35.020
My tits are out now.
‐ You're a jackass.
