on Jason Sullivan's face!

19:50.363 --> 19:52.974
3:00? How old are these people?

19:53.061 --> 19:54.541
Good point.

19:54.628 --> 19:56.195
A 12-year-old
should not be lecturing people

19:56.282 --> 19:58.849
about how they have
or have not lived their lives!

19:58.936 --> 20:00.547
You're trying to impress
a 12-year-old?

20:00.634 --> 20:02.984
Not trying to. Going to.

20:03.071 --> 20:05.029
I don't want this dead fish
in my house. You can have it.

20:05.116 --> 20:07.597
But once I help you,
you know what you have to do.

20:07.684 --> 20:09.686
Learn not to care
what other people think?

20:09.773 --> 20:10.905
Get a job!

20:10.992 --> 20:13.864
Yeah, that'll show 'em.

20:14.909 --> 20:16.998
I am going
to decide your punishment

20:17.085 --> 20:18.217
on a full stomach, Malcolm.

20:18.304 --> 20:20.480
-Malcolm?!
-Francis!

20:20.567 --> 20:22.046
You lied
about being drunk?

20:22.133 --> 20:23.700
What are you doing
with my fish?

20:23.787 --> 20:24.701
Dinner!

20:29.228 --> 20:31.795
I don't know where you get it,
the dishonesty.

20:31.882 --> 20:34.233
We are your family,
and you betray us.

20:34.320 --> 20:37.236
God, this is so good, Reese.
Thanks.

20:37.323 --> 20:39.368
You know, Malcolm, I would
like to reach into your ear

20:39.455 --> 20:40.630
and tear out that part
of your brain

20:40.717 --> 20:43.024
that makes you do things
like this!

20:43.111 --> 20:44.155
Smoky.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.809
That's the mesquite.

20:45.896 --> 20:48.856
I don't even know what's
happening in my own house.

20:48.943 --> 20:50.249
Really good, Reese.

20:50.336 --> 20:51.685
Hey, thanks for
your piece, Dewey.

20:51.772 --> 20:53.556
-You sure you don't want any?
-No, thanks.

20:53.643 --> 20:55.341
That is so nice of you, Dewey.

20:55.428 --> 20:56.994
At least we have one boy
we can trust.

20:59.780 --> 21:02.435
[ family snoring]

21:12.445 --> 21:13.794
I taste?

21:13.881 --> 21:15.578
You don't want that.

21:15.665 --> 21:17.493
Reese made this special
sleeping sauce for Mom and Dad,

21:17.580 --> 21:19.843
but I thought the whole
family deserved some.

21:27.547 --> 21:30.898
Mmm! A typical
American dinner, no?

21:30.985 --> 21:32.726
-A special American dinner.
-Mmm!

21:32.813 --> 21:34.771
-More Charms?
-Danke.

21:34.858 --> 21:37.992
Mmm, the frosted moons
and stars

21:38.079 --> 21:39.602
are both magic
and also delicious.

21:39.689 --> 21:41.038
Mm-hmm.

21:41.125 --> 21:42.605
I can't believe
they promised it to you

21:42.692 --> 21:44.303
and then just tried
to take it back.

21:44.390 --> 21:45.608
Forget about them.

21:45.695 --> 21:47.218
Let's just enjoy
our time together.

21:47.306 --> 21:48.524
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

22:27.868 --> 22:30.305
