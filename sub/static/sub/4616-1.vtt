<i>My mother always read bedtime stories to me,</i>

00:09.952 --> 00:15.250
<i>it was the tales and adventures and
animal stories as Trumpet of the Swan.</i>

00:15.334 --> 00:17.296
<i>They were my favorites.</i>

00:22.260 --> 00:26.098
<i>I remember how nasty
it might be in the middle</i>

00:26.181 --> 00:27.892
<i>mother always said to me:</i>

00:27.975 --> 00:31.145
<i>"Do not worry, Frankie.
There is a happy ending."</i>

00:31.229 --> 00:33.022
<i>And she was right.</i>

00:39.281 --> 00:41.200
<i>But this is not what
history anytime .</i>

00:41.283 --> 00:44.663
<i>This is the story of my life,
even if I'm only ten.</i>

NORTHWEST wildlife management.

01:09.609 --> 01:11.611
- Are you Ginny Newsom?
- Yes. What is it?

01:11.695 --> 01:14.198
I found a swan in the parking lot to
See & Save.

01:14.282 --> 01:15.409
It has blood under the wing.

01:15.492 --> 01:17.604
You have taken him to the right place.

01:20.790 --> 01:23.679
Call Dr. Betts and say
it looks like a gunshot wound.

01:27.214 --> 01:29.633
It was the last.

01:29.800 --> 01:32.012
Just a few stitches, then it's clear.

01:32.095 --> 01:33.179
What do you think?

01:33.180 --> 01:35.600
On the whole it is a lucky bird.

01:35.683 --> 01:37.186
Nobody injured.

01:37.227 --> 01:39.355
If it becomes infected
it should cope.

01:40.356 --> 01:43.860
I cut his wings
so he does not get too busy.

02:08.473 --> 02:12.479
<i>When the swan was shot, it was not the end,
it was only the beginning.</i>

02:14.690 --> 02:19.362
<i>He bounced back pretty soon,
and then it became interesting.</i>

02:36.258 --> 02:37.467
Good luck out there.

03:56.731 --> 03:59.567
Come on, kids. You are late.

03:59.651 --> 04:01.987
Okay, Dad. We come. We come.

04:02.071 --> 04:04.365
Kyle, you've taken my hairbrush?

04:07.369 --> 04:08.996
Good morning, Frankie.

04:09.997 --> 04:12.375
- Take it easy with the jam.
- Okay.

05:17.872 --> 05:18.998
Cool.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.336
What are you doing here?

05:22.419 --> 05:24.864
Frankie, you had better have my lunch ready.

05:32.181 --> 05:35.352
And I'm not joking.
The next time it is best that you ask me.

05:35.435 --> 05:38.230
- What is it?
- It is on the bench.

05:47.283 --> 05:50.061
- I have time only to the bus.
- I do not think so.

06:14.316 --> 06:16.068
What are you looking at?

06:17.111 --> 06:18.696
Give me the binoculars.

06:20.365 --> 06:22.326
Check so big they are.

06:22.410 --> 06:24.466
Hey, the bus is here. What do you do?

06:24.537 --> 06:25.539
Swans.

06:26.540 --> 06:29.042
I was thinking just the
what we would have for dinner.

06:29.084 --> 06:30.252
Dad.

06:30.502 --> 06:33.547
Come on, tree huggers,
otherwise you double chores this week.

06:33.548 --> 06:34.549
Quickening.

06:37.094 --> 06:39.554
Can we go and see the swans after school?

06:39.555 --> 06:42.058
It depends on how quickly
the deal can be swept.

06:42.100 --> 06:44.228
Well it means no.

06:44.312 --> 06:46.314
- Have fun.
- We will.

06:47.690 --> 06:49.401
Good morning, kids.

06:49.526 --> 06:51.569
- Hello, how are you?
- Good.

06:51.570 --> 06:53.071
Hello!

07:10.718 --> 07:12.054
I'm done.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.778
Goodbye, Angie.

07:26.363 --> 07:29.616
- Quickening. It will be dark soon.
- I'm coming.

07:29.617 --> 07:32.619
- But Dad said we have to do chores.
- We'll do that. Later.

07:32.620 --> 07:33.996
I had better not get into trouble.

07:34.080 --> 07:37.625
- And stretch, then?
- He is with Amanda Nethercott.

07:37.626 --> 07:38.627
Not again.

07:41.757 --> 07:44.218
- Do you think they're gone?
- They just got here.

07:44.301 --> 07:46.721
The book stayed the whole summer.

08:09.791 --> 08:11.751
And when the geese swam over.

08:11.835 --> 08:13.920
Began the larger tail
flapping and honking

08:14.004 --> 08:16.507
and hurried toward them
with wings like this.

08:18.886 --> 08:21.222
And all the geese were afraid
and honked and flew away.

08:21.264 --> 08:24.017
It was then that we saw
that he had a ring around the leg.

08:24.100 --> 08:26.269
It is the F-16.
So we named it Fighting Falcon.

08:26.352 --> 08:28.439
Do you understand?
F-16 plane called the Fighting Falcon.

08:28.522 --> 08:30.134
Yes, I understand. Let's eat.

08:30.191 --> 08:32.469
- Cool, eh?
- I think you're talking crap.

08:33.611 --> 08:35.668
Why should the tail care
if the geese?

08:36.030 --> 08:39.198
Birds can guard their areas
if they have built their nest.

08:40.662 --> 08:42.623
As they have laid eggs?

08:43.957 --> 08:46.002
I do not know what they do. They are birds.

08:46.085 --> 08:50.216
But there may be a reason to
to chase away other birds from the area.

08:51.717 --> 08:54.678
I only say this once, Frankie.

08:55.388 --> 08:56.933
You can watch them all you want,

08:57.016 --> 09:00.269
but do not touch them, feed them,
do not go too close to them, okay?

09:00.353 --> 09:01.730
Do you understand?

09:01.772 --> 09:05.067
There are wild animals,
like a bear or a fox.

09:05.150 --> 09:06.903
One should not disturb them.

09:06.986 --> 09:08.822
- Do you understand?
- Okay.

09:09.572 --> 09:11.157
- Kyle?
- Yes.

09:11.241 --> 09:12.367
- Stretch?
- Yes.

09:30.473 --> 09:32.058
Good night, sweetheart.

09:33.893 --> 09:35.396
What you got there?

09:35.479 --> 09:37.591
THE TRUMPET OF THE SWAN
of E. B. WHITE.

09:38.316 --> 09:39.901
Did you not read this?

09:39.985 --> 09:41.529
Well, I take it then.

09:42.947 --> 09:44.740
Can you read a little?

09:44.782 --> 09:47.243
- Cannot the heart?
- Whatever?

09:51.540 --> 09:52.790
Just a chapter.

09:52.791 --> 09:53.835
Wife at you.

09:54.879 --> 09:56.297
Okay.

09:58.340 --> 10:00.385
- From the beginning?
- Yes.

10:00.469 --> 10:01.595
Okay.

10:05.099 --> 10:07.185
"On the way back to camp through the swamp

10:07.268 --> 10:11.356
" asked Sam if he would tell
for his father what he had seen."

10:11.440 --> 10:14.194
" One thing is certain, 'he said to himself."

10:14.277 --> 10:17.323
"I'm going back to the pond tomorrow."

10:17.364 --> 10:19.198
"And I want to go there alone. '"

10:20.659 --> 10:22.037
What is it?

10:22.120 --> 10:24.623
They can live for up to 20 years.
It is a long time.

10:24.706 --> 10:26.333
And they can weigh up to 14 kilos.

10:26.374 --> 10:30.319
- It's probably more than you, Frankie.
- No. What do you know about it?

10:31.839 --> 10:33.551
It says here that the swans are omnivores.

10:33.635 --> 10:34.803
What?

10:34.844 --> 10:35.845
That means they eat everything.

10:35.887 --> 10:37.680
Even dad's meatloaf?

10:41.977 --> 10:43.562
Come on, Kyle.

10:47.400 --> 10:50.028
It says that they have a
wingspan of 2 meters.

10:50.111 --> 10:51.572
Is that all?

10:52.157 --> 10:53.242
Hello, Box.

10:53.325 --> 10:55.160
Do not worry.
There are many jobs for you.

10:55.244 --> 10:57.744
Okay, thanks. I worried
me about it in school.

10:57.872 --> 10:59.040
See you, Lars.

10:59.123 --> 11:00.250
Has dad told you?

11:00.333 --> 11:02.389
Swans that came here to have children.

11:02.419 --> 11:04.586
They can have six children at one time.

11:04.880 --> 11:06.549
It must hurt.

11:06.632 --> 11:07.675
And they called young swans.

11:07.758 --> 11:09.136
And then they teach them to swim.

11:09.219 --> 11:11.764
And then they teach them to fly
before the pond freezes.

11:11.889 --> 11:14.167
Right here. And we get to see everything.

11:26.907 --> 11:28.409
We'll buy pizza.

11:29.243 --> 11:31.455
- Will he run?
- Yes.

11:32.290 --> 11:33.457
No, never.

11:33.499 --> 11:35.722
I look forward to starting eighth grade.

11:36.878 --> 11:38.630
Okay, your loss.

11:42.927 --> 11:44.372
Just drive her out slowly.

11:49.603 --> 11:50.937
Slower than that, okay?

11:52.731 --> 11:53.899
Take your time.

11:54.232 --> 11:55.526
So where, yes.

11:55.943 --> 11:57.403
So where, yes.

11:58.112 --> 11:59.864
We take the oars.

12:21.891 --> 12:23.614
There's something big up front.

12:26.271 --> 12:27.982
Dad was right.

12:28.984 --> 12:29.985
I want to get closer.

12:30.069 --> 12:31.946
I do not know, Frankie.

12:31.987 --> 12:33.489
I am. Come on.

13:03.818 --> 13:05.027
Eggs.

13:05.945 --> 13:06.989
I said well there.

13:26.470 --> 13:27.514
Away with you!

13:27.598 --> 13:29.349
Let's go from here.

13:31.059 --> 13:32.144
Come.

13:32.227 --> 13:35.481
- Hurry up, Kyle.
- I think I broke my arm.

14:04.643 --> 14:05.852
Unbelievable.

14:05.936 --> 14:07.396
Kyle.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.758
You're lucky bird
did not break your neck.

14:11.651 --> 14:12.986
And, Frankie,

14:13.612 --> 14:16.615
Do not think I do not know
whose idea this was.

14:40.143 --> 14:41.143
Frankie.

14:41.144 --> 14:43.089
Go up, Frankie. The power has gone.

14:43.190 --> 14:46.026
Up, Frankie! Power has gone!

14:46.110 --> 14:48.154
- Now again?
- Yes. Come on.

14:51.783 --> 14:54.745
Come on! The bus is here anytime!
Come on!

14:58.833 --> 15:01.461
- What is it?
- 7.25.

15:01.545 --> 15:05.050
Okay, come on, hurry up.
You are late! Come on!

15:07.344 --> 15:09.430
Tell daddy that I will shortly.

15:09.722 --> 15:11.834
What are you doing up there? Hurry up.

15:17.190 --> 15:18.691
Take your bag.

15:19.150 --> 15:21.762
Here. We do not have time
to do somebody lunch.

15:25.366 --> 15:27.744
- How's the arm?
- It hurts.

15:45.683 --> 15:46.768
What happened?

15:55.986 --> 15:58.375
It seems to have flown into the power line.

15:59.449 --> 16:01.410
Not Fighting Falcon.

16:03.247 --> 16:04.248
No.

16:05.874 --> 16:07.251
It is the mother.

16:12.298 --> 16:15.135
Why do not you go and wait for the bus?

16:22.228 --> 16:25.983
We bury her when you come home
from school.

16:30.821 --> 16:33.324
- She's egg, father.
- I know. Yes.

16:35.326 --> 16:37.580
I also feel sorry for them,

16:37.663 --> 16:40.375
But we must let nature take its course.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.294
- It's unfair.
- I know.

16:45.089 --> 16:47.049
Go now. So, yes.

17:00.358 --> 17:05.696
TRUMPET TAILS AND STUDIES UNGSVANAR

17:36.486 --> 17:39.030
<i>She was one of our beautiful creatures, Lord.</i>

17:39.113 --> 17:42.785
We are proud that she chose
to make this place their home.

17:42.868 --> 17:47.374
We keep her close in our hearts
and carry with us the memory of her forever.

17:49.626 --> 17:51.419
Ask him to watch over the eggs.

17:53.839 --> 17:58.596
And dear God, please keep
a close eye on the swan's egg,

17:59.264 --> 18:02.934
and to ensure that the hatch
and keep them out of danger.

18:03.726 --> 18:04.895
And...

18:06.772 --> 18:07.982
And...

18:09.108 --> 18:10.902
God bless America.

18:13.363 --> 18:14.865
- Amen.
- Amen.

18:15.409 --> 18:16.868
- Amen.
- Amen.

18:17.661 --> 18:18.995
It was really nice, Box.

18:19.371 --> 18:20.414
Thanks.

18:21.958 --> 18:23.543
Okay, kids, now we go.

18:42.232 --> 18:44.444
- "God Bless America"?
- Hey.

20:00.704 --> 20:02.497
Are not you done yet?

20:02.539 --> 20:03.665
Add the.

20:03.748 --> 20:06.877
Never mind. Your clothes will take
longer to wash than mine.

20:06.961 --> 20:08.129
They do not at all.

20:08.212 --> 20:10.007
It was the stupidest thing you've said.

20:10.090 --> 20:12.468
The dumbest thing I've done
was to let you start.

20:12.552 --> 20:13.720
I would have been finished by now.

20:13.761 --> 20:14.887
Calm down.

20:15.346 --> 20:16.431
Hello.

20:18.601 --> 20:21.103
What? We already know that you're ugly.

20:23.315 --> 20:24.482
Dad is on delivery.

20:25.025 --> 20:26.470
Should we stand and check?

20:29.239 --> 20:30.699
Stay tuned.

20:34.787 --> 20:37.065
- Hurry up, Frankie.
- I'll do after that.

20:48.554 --> 20:49.931
Here, change.

21:19.758 --> 21:21.636
What do we do now?

21:22.011 --> 21:24.514
We keep them warm until they hatch.

21:26.642 --> 21:28.228
What should be kept warm?

21:31.649 --> 21:34.318
I want an answer. What should be kept warm?

21:34.402 --> 21:36.653
- Stretch?
- Yes, we...

21:36.654 --> 21:39.821
We took the eggs from the nest
and will take care of them.

21:44.831 --> 21:46.834
I told you not to interfere.

21:46.917 --> 21:48.836
You just thought to let the Coyotes take them.

21:48.920 --> 21:51.631
You going to let them die,
and we saved them.

21:51.840 --> 21:54.259
And now, when? What will you do with the eggs?

21:54.384 --> 21:55.469
Kyle checked up everything.

21:55.553 --> 21:57.179
We will keep them warm until they hatch.

21:57.221 --> 22:00.666
We give them food and water and insects
and whatever they need.

22:01.476 --> 22:03.687
I expect more of you both.

22:04.688 --> 22:06.233
Give me that.

22:07.192 --> 22:09.915
Go and wait outside.
I will take care of you soon.

22:12.782 --> 22:15.785
You cannot keep eggs.

22:15.869 --> 22:19.040
They are wild animals, not pets.

22:19.123 --> 22:21.667
And do not give me that face.

22:21.709 --> 22:25.715
I was very clear about this,
and you defied me twice.

22:28.176 --> 22:29.565
Clean finished your room,

22:29.595 --> 22:32.806
so I decide if
what I want to do with the eggs.

22:34.308 --> 22:36.728
Mom would never have left them there.

22:51.245 --> 22:53.248
Kyle, you broke your arm when you were there.

22:53.290 --> 22:55.501
I told you to stay away.

22:55.584 --> 22:58.380
You should be a model for Frankie.

22:58.463 --> 22:59.839
Do you understand?

23:00.298 --> 23:02.926
Come on. I do not want
have to say it again.

23:22.702 --> 23:23.911
I have a question.

23:23.995 --> 23:26.789
Do you know how to take care of the cygnets?

23:29.084 --> 23:30.711
Do you know what you feed cygnets with?

23:30.794 --> 23:34.882
<i>If this is an emergency,
please hang up and call the central station.</i>

23:35.758 --> 23:37.760
<i>- Hey, the vet.
- You've come to the vet.</i>

23:37.802 --> 23:38.803
<i>Animal Hospital. Can I help?</i>

23:38.804 --> 23:39.847
<i>- Veterinary Office.
- Veterinary Office.</i>

23:39.930 --> 23:41.850
- What is a...
<i>- Ornithologist?</i>

23:41.933 --> 23:44.227
- What?
<i>- There is someone who studies birds.</i>

23:44.311 --> 23:46.564
- Do you know anyone like that?
<i>- Yes.</i>

23:46.647 --> 23:48.065
<i>I have a number here.</i>

23:48.149 --> 23:49.817
<i>Area code 541...</i>

23:52.821 --> 23:54.031
Northwest wildlife management.

23:54.364 --> 23:58.161
Hello. I want to talk to an orthinolog.

23:58.786 --> 24:01.081
An ornithologist? It is someone who studies...

24:01.165 --> 24:02.721
Yes, I know, the other told.

24:03.585 --> 24:07.673
I need to talk to him because I
must know how to take care of the cygnets.

24:08.174 --> 24:09.842
<i>Okay. Is it a school project?</i>

24:10.092 --> 24:11.844
I want you to do your homework.

24:12.136 --> 24:16.600
No, only if I do not know
forcing my dad put me back the eggs.

24:16.683 --> 24:18.685
And I think the Coyotes take them.

24:18.769 --> 24:21.023
- Have you swan eggs?
<i>- Yes.</i>

24:21.148 --> 24:24.860
They came to our pond and built the nest,
but died mother and...

24:24.861 --> 24:27.155
I forgot. First, we looked for the eggs,

24:27.238 --> 24:30.461
and Fighting Falcon attacked us,
so we ended up in trouble.

24:30.660 --> 24:32.716
<i>Kyle broke his arm. He is my brother.</i>

24:33.621 --> 24:36.040
Okay, you have swans or have a falcon?

24:36.123 --> 24:38.876
A swan is a large white bird
with a long neck, and a falcon is...

24:38.877 --> 24:40.421
It's trumpet swans.

24:40.463 --> 24:42.132
We just called the father
of the Fighting Falcon

24:42.216 --> 24:44.272
because he has a ring around the leg.

24:44.927 --> 24:47.262
<i>I want to be a fighter pilot
when I grow up...</i>

24:47.346 --> 24:50.684
Wait a minute. What did it on the ring?

24:50.934 --> 24:53.353
F-16. Fighting Falcon.

24:55.940 --> 24:58.944
Frankie, you should be ready
with the room now.

24:59.027 --> 25:02.448
I have to go. Can you tell
how to take care of them?

25:02.490 --> 25:05.285
Yep. You can tell us where you live first?

25:26.060 --> 25:27.854
- Let me check this out.
- Yes.

25:38.743 --> 25:39.952
Hello, stranger.

25:39.953 --> 25:41.913
Excuse me? Sir?

25:41.955 --> 25:43.206
- Yes?
- Hello.

25:46.461 --> 25:48.004
Can I help you?

25:48.087 --> 25:50.131
Yes, my name is Tim McMurray.

25:50.214 --> 25:51.717
- Jack Peterson.
- Jack.

25:51.800 --> 25:52.967
And this is Ginny Newsom.

25:52.968 --> 25:55.191
Hey, I heard you had a couple swan eggs.

25:55.763 --> 25:57.391
Yes, my daughter has them.

25:57.475 --> 25:59.602
Frankie! Come here!

26:03.857 --> 26:05.275
Are you the bird woman?

26:05.359 --> 26:06.485
Yes.

26:07.235 --> 26:09.735
She must learn to take care of the swan eggs.

26:10.073 --> 26:12.533
The best way to take care of them
is to show me where they are

26:12.617 --> 26:15.395
so that I can see to
that you have not harmed them.

26:15.914 --> 26:18.999
I'm pretty sure
she has not harmed them.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.002
But, yes, we would appreciate some help.

26:21.003 --> 26:22.922
Good. Where are they?

26:25.174 --> 26:26.510
Here.

26:26.551 --> 26:29.346
We thought put them back tonight.

26:30.013 --> 26:31.098
Good.

26:38.233 --> 26:40.110
It does not look so dangerous.

26:41.820 --> 26:45.032
- Wait. You may not take them.
- Yes, I get.

26:45.366 --> 26:47.702
But, Dad, she would tell
how to take care of them.

26:47.785 --> 26:49.496
Hold on here.

26:49.579 --> 26:51.644
My children think they
have saved the eggs, so...

26:51.670 --> 26:52.357
Ginny...

26:52.499 --> 26:55.129
They would never have moved from the nest.

26:55.212 --> 26:57.589
I understand. But they
moved from the nest, so...

26:57.673 --> 26:59.048
Kyle broke through the arm.

26:59.049 --> 27:00.719
And we got extra chores to do.

27:00.802 --> 27:02.929
My children have become involved in the eggs,

27:03.012 --> 27:04.180
so if you can be a little patient.

27:04.264 --> 27:05.849
- And explain...
- There are not toys.

27:05.890 --> 27:07.685
It is very important birds.

27:07.977 --> 27:10.062
We saved them. They are ours.

27:11.063 --> 27:13.341
Listen. Swan you call the Fighting Falcon

27:13.401 --> 27:15.153
is part of a national research project

27:15.236 --> 27:18.292
I've developed to reintroduce
trumpet swans in the wild.

27:18.365 --> 27:22.077
We maintain the natural environment,
tracks populations, hatching eggs,

27:22.161 --> 27:25.749
noticing birds and rehabilitates
them when they are injured.

27:25.832 --> 27:28.376
I hatched and reared the F-16 from an egg,

27:28.460 --> 27:31.505
and plasters of him
when he was shot last winter.

27:31.589 --> 27:35.093
He is my bird. This is his eggs.
Therefore, the mine.

27:38.347 --> 27:39.766
- Wait a minute.
- Excuse me.

27:39.849 --> 27:42.102
- But...
- Frankie, there is no danger.

27:55.035 --> 27:56.119
You, girl.

27:56.703 --> 28:01.042
You know a lot about birds,
but you know nothing about children.

28:04.671 --> 28:08.338
Oops, Ginny. I had no idea
that you were one of those human people.

28:08.342 --> 28:09.468
Yes.

28:22.819 --> 28:26.708
<i>After the bird woman had gone with my eggs
stayed Fighting Falcon left.</i>

28:26.781 --> 28:30.829
<i>Even though he was the one who was left
he made the pond their home. </ I ></i>

28:49.393 --> 28:51.187
Not there.

28:51.229 --> 28:53.356
Put it with the others.

28:55.191 --> 28:56.777
And do not drop it.

28:58.904 --> 29:01.449
I thought of camping tour today.

29:01.532 --> 29:03.410
We need to start planning.

29:03.493 --> 29:06.204
Stretch, it's your turn to choose.
Any thoughts?

29:07.205 --> 29:08.583
Maybe Green River Lakes?

29:09.877 --> 29:11.211
It sounds good.

29:11.253 --> 29:14.214
Or so we return to the Henry's Fork.
You loved it last year.

29:14.215 --> 29:16.216
Yes. Do you remember the trout I caught?

29:16.217 --> 29:17.594
He was enormous.

29:21.348 --> 29:23.571
I do not care.
We got a lot of shit last.

29:23.851 --> 29:25.604
Stop being so childish.

29:25.687 --> 29:27.229
- We'll see who is childish.
- Hey!

29:27.230 --> 29:28.232
Stop.

29:29.108 --> 29:31.195
Kyle, guess who I am.

29:32.529 --> 29:34.406
Amanda.

29:34.823 --> 29:36.490
Stretch, you are so beautiful.

29:37.452 --> 29:39.829
- You missed.
- Can you stop PIFFLE, huh?

29:39.913 --> 29:41.498
What are you doing?

29:41.581 --> 29:43.793
Stretch has decided
about the camping trip.

29:43.876 --> 29:45.211
Really?

29:45.961 --> 29:49.050
Yes, I thought maybe Wallowa National Park.

29:49.133 --> 29:50.259
Wallowa?

29:50.802 --> 29:53.429
There is crawling with tourists. Why Wallowa?

29:54.098 --> 29:55.265
It's nice there.

29:59.646 --> 30:01.064
Okay, sure.

30:01.147 --> 30:02.315
Come and help me when you're done.

30:02.399 --> 30:08.865
Dad, I think it was there
bird woman took the swan eggs.

30:09.282 --> 30:12.286
And, you know,
maybe if it's bad luck one day

30:12.328 --> 30:16.290
so maybe we can go and take a look.

30:19.294 --> 30:21.672
Now I understand.

30:29.850 --> 30:31.560
I'll think about it.

30:33.437 --> 30:34.605
Okay.

30:39.110 --> 30:40.529
You owe me a favor.

30:42.823 --> 30:44.700
<i>I was so wound up, on the way to Wallowa</i>

30:44.783 --> 30:47.450
<i>that it settled
that it was the stretch that ran.</i>

30:47.872 --> 30:52.794
<i>Kyle told me to stop hug me,
but I saw that he too was excited.</i>

30:52.878 --> 30:56.006
They are about two months old now
and feel great.

30:56.089 --> 30:57.339
Come on, they're over here.

30:57.340 --> 30:59.886
Is this any different swans?

30:59.969 --> 31:03.347
Yes, we are trying to track the various flocks
and the birds that we have noticed.

31:03.348 --> 31:04.976
Look where we are.

31:06.853 --> 31:08.021
Hello.

31:08.981 --> 31:10.691
What are you doing here?

31:10.775 --> 31:14.111
We were in the park and
kids wanted to look past

31:14.195 --> 31:18.366
and see how it was with
the eggs and the birds.

31:18.450 --> 31:21.704
Yes, sorry, we do not allow the public
come into birds.

31:21.788 --> 31:24.708
We have to limit their contact with
people as much as we can.

31:24.792 --> 31:27.962
Ginny, come on.
A quick look hurt you not?

31:29.339 --> 31:30.381
Okay.

31:31.466 --> 31:32.802
Then go.

31:33.677 --> 31:35.012
Thanks.

31:42.855 --> 31:47.401
We have set up a visual barrier so they
do not become too accustomed to humans.

31:47.402 --> 31:49.948
But you can look through the hole.

32:00.709 --> 32:02.088
Look, Dad.

32:02.463 --> 32:03.798
Where are the other two?

32:03.881 --> 32:05.826
Only three of the eggs were viable.

32:06.300 --> 32:08.637
This means that only three
of the eggs hatched.

32:08.720 --> 32:10.431
The other two...

32:10.931 --> 32:12.015
Did they die?

32:12.434 --> 32:14.436
Three of the five are
actually good proportions.

32:14.936 --> 32:18.103
Was it because of me?
Because I took them out of the nest?

32:18.148 --> 32:21.445
No, all the eggs in a nest hatch not,
not even in the wild.

32:21.820 --> 32:23.405
It was not your fault.

32:26.242 --> 32:27.452
We baptize them.

32:29.370 --> 32:31.039
Thanks. It means a lot to her.

32:31.123 --> 32:32.499
Yes. She is dedicated.

32:33.542 --> 32:35.795
Stubborn is what she is.

32:35.879 --> 32:39.935
When she attaches itself to something
it is impossible to get her to stop.

32:41.470 --> 32:42.471
I am the same.

32:43.430 --> 32:44.819
That may be called Alpha.

32:45.474 --> 32:47.863
Yes. The Cooler, which may be called Bravo.

32:47.935 --> 32:51.606
And the little sweet may be called Charlie.

32:51.689 --> 32:53.650
It sounds like a good idea.

32:57.321 --> 32:59.449
I look to the Fighting Falcon
every afternoon.

32:59.491 --> 33:01.035
Do you?

33:01.076 --> 33:03.162
- Is he still there?
- Yes.

33:03.245 --> 33:05.498
Okay, kids, let's move on?

33:05.499 --> 33:06.750
- Thanks.
- Yes.

33:14.342 --> 33:15.676
- Bye, Ginny.
- Bye.

33:16.428 --> 33:17.888
- Bye, Tim.
- Bye.

33:19.891 --> 33:21.769
Time to carry out the garbage.

33:22.520 --> 33:23.521
Dad.

33:24.814 --> 33:27.441
Yes, it was not so bad?

33:54.182 --> 33:56.184
<i>Our summer vacation was over,</i>

33:56.268 --> 33:58.981
<i>and dad would have been
the end of it.</i>

34:13.581 --> 34:14.916
- Hello.
- Hello.

34:23.092 --> 34:24.094
Hello?

34:25.637 --> 34:27.723
- Jack, huh?
- Yes.

34:28.391 --> 34:29.641
What is this?

34:30.768 --> 34:33.935
It's time for the birds
to be released back into the wild.

34:34.398 --> 34:35.857
- Here?
- Yes.

34:35.940 --> 34:37.109
Ginny.

34:37.110 --> 34:38.654
Have you taken them back here?

34:38.737 --> 34:40.904
- Wait, wait.
- Yes. This is their home.

34:42.157 --> 34:44.159
No, no. This is my home.

34:44.244 --> 34:48.123
Absolutely not. Do not you
the distraction this will be.

34:48.206 --> 34:50.125
What I understand is that the birds

34:50.126 --> 34:53.629
should spend time with an adult, learn to fly
and headed south for the winter.

34:54.130 --> 34:56.342
It's their best chance
to survival in the wild.

34:56.426 --> 34:59.721
Live there, their father, so
there should be children.

34:59.804 --> 35:02.433
No, no. This is not
haven for wildlife.

35:02.516 --> 35:03.767
This is a trade name.

35:03.851 --> 35:05.936
I do not come to your job
and cut down trees.

35:06.020 --> 35:09.149
No, I work in a national forest.
It would be illegal.

35:15.115 --> 35:18.077
This is also illegal.

35:18.911 --> 35:21.164
You intruding.

35:21.205 --> 35:22.332
- Dad?
- No no.

35:22.415 --> 35:25.544
You begets not give up the birds on my land.

35:35.390 --> 35:38.435
She is not actually on your ground, Jack.

35:39.102 --> 35:42.190
- State land.
- With one centimeter margin.

35:44.275 --> 35:46.194
This is unbelievable.

35:49.573 --> 35:51.533
Charlie, you start getting so big.

36:01.213 --> 36:03.090
What are you doing?

36:03.173 --> 36:05.259
We have to get him at
to swan babies in the pond,

36:05.343 --> 36:07.428
so we must build a pasture.

36:07.512 --> 36:11.934
Why will not you just print them
to the father?

36:12.017 --> 36:15.773
Because of early embossing.
He might be territorial.

36:16.857 --> 36:17.969
What does this mean?

36:19.652 --> 36:20.820
Territorial?

36:22.239 --> 36:25.784
Fighting Falcon may not remember the kids,

36:25.867 --> 36:27.412
so he may believe that they are intruders.

36:27.495 --> 36:29.051
He teaches them to fly then?

36:29.789 --> 36:32.251
He can try to kill them, huh?

36:32.877 --> 36:34.212
It's a possibility, yes.

36:35.505 --> 36:37.007
But that's why I built the pasture.

36:37.090 --> 36:39.260
I try to prevent it happening.

36:40.761 --> 36:41.971
Will you help?

36:43.347 --> 36:45.058
- Yes.
- Sure.

36:45.142 --> 36:46.810
Okay. Hold it.

36:48.020 --> 36:49.104
Do you have it?

37:39.500 --> 37:40.668
It's no big deal.

37:40.751 --> 37:43.380
If she needs something more
, we will only and retrieves it.

37:43.463 --> 37:44.631
Hey.

37:45.674 --> 37:46.800
Where are you?

37:46.883 --> 37:48.344
Down to the pond.

37:48.427 --> 37:49.888
We take our break.

37:49.930 --> 37:51.348
Yes. And my wood, eh?

37:51.682 --> 37:53.100
It's rubbish, Dad.

37:53.183 --> 37:54.477
We are back in ten.

37:54.560 --> 37:57.063
As soon as we have
this down to Ginny.

38:05.030 --> 38:06.864
They have not arrived yet, Daddy.

38:06.908 --> 38:09.370
What? I called them 20 minutes ago.

38:09.453 --> 38:10.788
Least.

38:27.475 --> 38:30.021
Did not you hear me calling?
It's dinnertime.

38:30.104 --> 38:31.188
No. Excuse me, Dad.

38:31.272 --> 38:32.940
Come on, then.

38:33.774 --> 38:35.902
- See you later, Ginny.
- Bye.

38:36.987 --> 38:38.989
I do not know why you
spend all your time and energy.

38:39.072 --> 38:41.408
Why does not nature take its course?

38:41.409 --> 38:42.535
Nature?

38:42.618 --> 38:45.956
Wires and coarse hail
is not a part of nature.

38:46.875 --> 38:50.419
Did you know that these birds were hunted
so ruthlessly in the 30's for fun

38:50.420 --> 38:52.976
there were fewer than
70 remain in the country?

38:53.090 --> 38:55.843
How do you think Frankie will take the
if you open pasture

38:55.926 --> 38:59.181
and tail come here
pecking kill their young?

39:00.349 --> 39:02.935
Will you keep an admonishing speech?

39:04.312 --> 39:05.521
She is ten years old.

39:06.440 --> 39:10.496
Then she should be old enough to realize
that life can sometimes be cruel.

39:13.114 --> 39:14.492
She knows it.

39:32.222 --> 39:33.473
Then we eat.

39:39.397 --> 39:41.357
Come on. Add up the food.

40:05.762 --> 40:08.808
I finished my chores early
so I could help.

40:08.891 --> 40:11.185
I would have liked to have your help,

40:11.269 --> 40:13.731
and I like having you here,

40:13.814 --> 40:17.401
but I cannot make your dad
angrier than I have done him.

40:17.484 --> 40:20.196
I do not know what he's so upset,

40:20.280 --> 40:23.994
but he can make life miserable for me here
if he wants to.

40:24.619 --> 40:29.082
Dad said we must come and help
as long as we did our chores.

40:30.877 --> 40:32.962
He's just angry about... Yes...

40:35.299 --> 40:36.592
My mother died.

40:37.092 --> 40:38.969
She died two years ago.

40:40.721 --> 40:44.101
And Dad says we have to move on.
Do you understand?

40:44.143 --> 40:46.562
This is how nature works sometimes.

40:49.107 --> 40:50.192
Yes.

40:50.567 --> 40:52.319
But not always.

40:52.402 --> 40:54.822
Sometimes we can help nature.

40:54.906 --> 40:57.533
Give me that cutter over there.

40:59.870 --> 41:04.000
We'll cut these
so they do not hang down.

41:38.333 --> 41:40.921
- Frankie.
- Come here. He comes.

42:07.662 --> 42:09.706
- He sticks.
- No, no, this is great.

42:09.789 --> 42:12.667
He must get used to being there.
He comes back.

42:13.084 --> 42:14.295
You should also go.

42:14.378 --> 42:17.673
Your dad is coming soon, and then it
all birds within 8 km away frightened.

42:17.965 --> 42:19.677
- Bye, Ginny.
- Bye.

42:20.887 --> 42:22.638
I almost forgot.

42:22.680 --> 42:25.893
Dad asked me to invite you to dinner
tomorrow night.

42:27.811 --> 42:29.923
Would your dad that I come for dinner?

42:32.692 --> 42:33.777
Okay.

42:34.319 --> 42:37.031
- Should I bring something?
- No. Dad cooking.

42:40.744 --> 42:43.247
You begging for it, Frankie.

42:47.251 --> 42:48.712
What should I do now, Dad?

42:48.754 --> 42:50.923
You may well set the table?

42:54.260 --> 42:57.056
Here, set the table so I beat you.

42:58.974 --> 43:01.436
Daddy wants you cloths.

43:01.520 --> 43:03.230
Kyle, take loaves.

43:13.742 --> 43:15.744
- Hello.
- Hello.

43:16.872 --> 43:18.749
I hope I will not be late.

43:18.791 --> 43:22.291
Frankie said I would not take anything,
but I could not keep me.

43:30.680 --> 43:32.223
- Sorry.
- No no no.

43:32.306 --> 43:35.769
You are... Yes. You're just in time. Come in.

43:35.770 --> 43:38.064
It is just finished.

43:41.986 --> 43:43.598
- Beautiful flowers.
- Thanks.

43:47.784 --> 43:48.994
Thanks.

43:50.704 --> 43:53.750
- It's steak sandwich tonight.
- I see it.

43:56.211 --> 43:57.797
I'm a vegetarian.

44:08.142 --> 44:10.771
We have baked beans and pickles.

44:10.937 --> 44:13.023
You can make a bacon sandwich.

44:48.858 --> 44:52.239
When I come back should the table
be cleared and the dishes clean.

44:52.322 --> 44:53.448
Yes, sir.

44:55.409 --> 44:57.620
You know that I spend half the year

44:57.703 --> 44:59.747
chasing birds alone through the wilderness.

44:59.831 --> 45:01.583
I find to my caravan.

45:02.126 --> 45:06.296
It can certainly,
but I must well be a role model?

45:06.380 --> 45:08.174
Yes. There you need.

45:10.135 --> 45:12.858
It must be difficult
raising three children alone.

45:13.390 --> 45:16.226
Yes, that's why we've Mack evenings.

45:19.105 --> 45:21.774
- May I ask you a question?
- Sure.

45:23.109 --> 45:26.905
Why do you put so much time
to work with the birds?

45:26.947 --> 45:29.909
Are they not just birds?

45:32.079 --> 45:34.039
Thanks for dinner, Jack.

45:34.123 --> 45:35.459
No, I...

45:35.500 --> 45:37.878
I did not mean it...

45:37.919 --> 45:41.174
There just seems to be so lonely.

45:43.926 --> 45:45.538
Think about what I do and why

45:45.595 --> 45:48.932
next time Frankie look at the birds
and become happy.

45:50.351 --> 45:52.980
Then you might understand it a little better.

45:53.063 --> 45:54.190
Good night.

45:59.237 --> 46:02.699
Peterson, trumpeter
Swan-haven.

46:17.426 --> 46:19.136
Open all the way.

46:22.516 --> 46:25.018
- There is a hook on the other side.
- Okay.

46:33.238 --> 46:34.989
Come. Come on.

46:45.502 --> 46:47.547
Down with you. Down.

47:33.561 --> 47:34.937
Good luck.

47:41.904 --> 47:43.323
Look how cute they are.

47:43.657 --> 47:44.908
Everyone does as he does.

47:44.991 --> 47:46.494
- Do they?
- Yes.

47:46.577 --> 47:49.373
It's like something I read in
<i>Trumpet of the Swan.</i>

47:49.414 --> 47:50.832
It is good, so it should look like.

47:51.041 --> 47:53.293
It is my absolute favorite book.

47:54.254 --> 47:55.672
I've never actually read it.

47:55.755 --> 47:56.756
Not?

47:57.006 --> 47:59.552
Our mother used to read it to us
when we were little.

47:59.635 --> 48:02.846
She said that if she were a swan
she had wanted to stay here.

48:02.930 --> 48:03.931
She was right.

48:05.851 --> 48:09.146
When I was little, I had only
a tree in front of my apartment building.

48:09.230 --> 48:10.856
- A tree?
- Yes.

48:10.898 --> 48:12.859
I lived in Chicago.

48:12.943 --> 48:15.237
And the tree was in the
middle of the pavement.

48:15.320 --> 48:18.866
It just had a small piece of cake
earth around him, this big.

48:20.243 --> 48:21.703
And somehow, throughout the great city,

48:21.786 --> 48:24.958
knew all the birds find
this little plot nature.

48:25.875 --> 48:28.629
And the spring was full of birds there,
all possible varieties.

48:28.713 --> 48:30.881
And they always sang. And I loved it.

48:31.465 --> 48:34.177
They always know how to
find the best places.

48:35.762 --> 48:36.889
They do.

49:08.177 --> 49:10.305
Jack! Jack!

49:10.388 --> 49:12.557
Hey! Stop!

49:12.641 --> 49:13.683
Stop!

49:13.934 --> 49:15.561
Turn it off!

49:15.645 --> 49:16.812
Are you crazy?

49:17.188 --> 49:18.940
This is very sensitive creatures, Jack.

49:18.981 --> 49:22.315
You cannot just make their residency
to a construction site.

49:22.487 --> 49:24.948
- But...
- he thinks it is uncertain, he draws.

49:24.989 --> 49:27.576
Where is the end of everything.
What were you thinking?

49:27.660 --> 49:31.163
I thought I'd
bury electric wires

49:31.247 --> 49:34.918
so that they are safe when they start flying.

49:38.756 --> 49:40.968
Digs down the power lines?

49:41.051 --> 49:44.639
Yes, I mean, just the here near the pond.

49:46.975 --> 49:48.518
And I...

49:48.601 --> 49:53.232
I purchased these kinds
to the power lines in the way.

49:54.901 --> 49:56.278
On the Internet.

49:58.446 --> 49:59.991
I do not know what to say.

50:01.994 --> 50:04.538
How about "thanks"?

50:05.706 --> 50:07.000
Thank you.

50:07.208 --> 50:08.376
You, Ginny.

50:08.835 --> 50:11.421
Do you want me to pick up a rock or something?

50:15.342 --> 50:16.760
No, I...

50:18.305 --> 50:20.099
I go back to my caravan.

50:22.351 --> 50:23.770
Try just to be quiet.

50:24.187 --> 50:25.564
Yes, ma'am.

50:28.025 --> 50:29.443
Stylish boots.

50:34.824 --> 50:39.039
My cousin works for the power company,
did it as a favor.

50:40.999 --> 50:43.002
I did not think you liked birds.

50:45.922 --> 50:50.677
The bird knew about
to the kids was his responsibility.

50:52.054 --> 50:54.057
He has care of them.

50:55.642 --> 50:59.272
Everything went wrong
and he tries to put things right.

50:59.356 --> 51:01.942
I thought he needed help.

51:03.318 --> 51:05.196
Or something in that direction.

51:07.073 --> 51:09.575
It was a great example to set an.

51:15.666 --> 51:20.589
Frankie said that swans are linked for life.

51:21.340 --> 51:23.259
What should he do?

51:24.094 --> 51:26.680
It takes a while, but he
find another female.

51:34.106 --> 51:35.942
I guess I should go.

51:36.693 --> 51:37.819
Okay.

51:38.736 --> 51:41.125
- Thanks for the dinner.
- No problems. Yes.

51:42.658 --> 51:44.451
- Bye.
- Bye.

Yes, I'll do the driving. Okay, Dad?

52:23.082 --> 52:24.292
Good luck.

- See you later, huh?
- Yeah, sure.

- Hey, Amanda.

52:37.809 --> 52:39.770

- Yes.

52:40.228 --> 52:42.189
Who was your dad?

52:43.566 --> 52:44.651
None.

- Good.

Excuse us.

54:29.738 --> 54:32.241
I want a corn dog
and a grapefruit soda.

54:32.325 --> 54:34.035
Do you want something?

54:34.118 --> 54:37.329
Yes, I make the same thing.

54:37.330 --> 54:39.333
Two corn dogs, two grapefruit soda.

54:39.416 --> 54:41.334
Do not you vegetarian?

54:41.335 --> 54:44.089
I do not think it's so much
meat in there.

54:44.881 --> 54:46.174
Thanks.

54:49.011 --> 54:50.347
Thanks.

54:53.016 --> 54:54.768
Do not tell your father.

54:55.561 --> 54:59.023
Yes! Yes! He has it!

Yes!

55:07.200 --> 55:08.744
Your brother is impressive.

55:08.828 --> 55:10.705
Yes. He's really good.

55:10.788 --> 55:12.833
I want to run, but Dad says
I'm too young.

55:12.874 --> 55:15.377
I save so that I can buy
a peewee next year.

55:15.836 --> 55:17.170
Are not you afraid?

55:17.254 --> 55:18.965
No. You just have to practice.

55:19.048 --> 55:20.591
I run a lot on the quad.

55:20.675 --> 55:22.384
Stretch helps me.

55:22.385 --> 55:25.441
<i>They are on the last lap.
Peterson is still in the lead.</i>

55:25.514 --> 55:28.977

Hey, Stretch!

55:42.994 --> 55:44.412
Unbelievable.

55:46.540 --> 55:47.917
He won.

56:01.308 --> 56:03.435
I'll take her. Help Stretch you.

56:11.446 --> 56:13.073
Hey, honey.

56:13.531 --> 56:15.450
Hello. Come on.

56:19.455 --> 56:22.084
Okay, I got you.

56:59.254 --> 57:01.923
I had so much fun tonight, Ginny.

57:04.636 --> 57:05.721
I'm with.

57:07.472 --> 57:08.725
Good night.

57:19.361 --> 57:20.530
Hello.

57:26.038 --> 57:27.914
Should I follow you back?

57:27.998 --> 57:30.459
- Yes. It would be fine.
- Okay.

57:37.968 --> 57:40.220
I see a lot of you Frankie.

57:41.513 --> 57:46.645
She resembles her mother,
but it's a bit of me in her.

57:50.567 --> 57:53.320
Can I ask what happened to the mother?

57:55.573 --> 57:59.577
Sara went in on a check,
and they found a lump.

58:01.138 --> 58:03.474
But they did not think it was something,

58:03.516 --> 58:06.437
But they did some tests,
and it was cancer.

58:08.605 --> 58:12.819
They said they had found it early,
so she had 95% chance

58:15.822 --> 58:16.823
att,

58:18.325 --> 58:19.702
Survive.

58:20.912 --> 58:24.250
She was only 37 and a fighter.

58:26.502 --> 58:28.963
Four months later, she was gone.

58:31.592 --> 58:32.968
I regret.

58:38.224 --> 58:39.559
So...

58:39.977 --> 58:42.397
Frankie really like you.

58:43.273 --> 58:44.399
Really?

58:46.986 --> 58:48.696
What I wanted to say was...

58:52.409 --> 58:53.994
I really like you too.

59:09.262 --> 59:12.058
You know what? I...
Excuse. I should go myself.

59:12.141 --> 59:13.393
Yes, sorry.

59:13.476 --> 59:15.354
- Kids, and...
- Of course.

59:20.610 --> 59:22.405
- See you tomorrow?
- Yes. Obvious.

59:22.488 --> 59:23.531
- Okay.
- Okay.

59:23.572 --> 59:25.157
I'll find out for yourself.

59:44.765 --> 59:47.810
<i>Swan chicks grew as it creaked.
As weeds.</i>

59:47.893 --> 59:50.105
<i>As we, daddy used to say.</i>

59:50.188 --> 59:54.066
<i>Kyle started getting difficult
To distinguish between them, but not me.</i>

59:54.067 --> 59:57.071
<i>The kids were gray and the Fighting Falcon,</i>

59:57.072 --> 01:00:00.284
<i>he was happy to show them
how they would cope.</i>

01:00:02.245 --> 01:00:03.788
It smells good.

01:00:03.872 --> 01:00:05.081
Yes, good.

01:00:05.165 --> 01:00:07.918
- Thank you cooking again.
- No problems.

01:00:08.127 --> 01:00:10.086
Pasta primavera again.

01:00:10.087 --> 01:00:13.133
I was not joking when I said
that's all I can do.

01:00:14.092 --> 01:00:15.845
There is no danger. It's really good.

01:00:15.928 --> 01:00:17.096
Really?

01:00:17.638 --> 01:00:19.641
- Really good?
- Really, really good.

01:00:19.725 --> 01:00:21.477
Really, really good?

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:23.687
Really, really, really good.

01:00:25.148 --> 01:00:27.108
It was really good.

01:00:28.401 --> 01:00:29.819
Is the food ready?

01:00:30.821 --> 01:00:31.947
Yes.

01:00:33.365 --> 01:00:35.310
You may well pick Kyle and Frankie?

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:48.134
Ready? Break.

01:00:48.843 --> 01:00:49.969
Okay.

01:00:50.136 --> 01:00:51.262
Okay.

01:00:51.763 --> 01:00:53.682
Hut one, hut two, throws.

01:00:54.141 --> 01:00:55.727
A Mississippi. Two Mississippi.

01:00:55.811 --> 01:00:58.105
- Three.
- Cast, Dad! I'm free!

01:00:58.146 --> 01:01:00.733
Yes, turn, run. Come around him.

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:03.820
- Yes.
- Neat!

01:01:04.695 --> 01:01:06.406
Touchdown.

01:01:06.490 --> 01:01:07.699
Really, Stretch?

01:01:07.741 --> 01:01:09.159
She broke up.

01:01:09.451 --> 01:01:10.829
It was.

01:01:13.164 --> 01:01:15.042
- Look at them.
- See there.

01:01:19.923 --> 01:01:21.967
Alpha, you are ready to lift.

01:01:26.055 --> 01:01:27.611
Where is the time for Bravo.

01:01:30.436 --> 01:01:31.854
You can do it.

01:01:32.187 --> 01:01:33.731
Come on, Charlie. You can do it.

01:01:33.773 --> 01:01:35.276
- Come on, old man.
- Where he flies.

01:01:35.359 --> 01:01:36.485
Watch.

01:01:38.737 --> 01:01:39.865
Continue.

01:01:41.491 --> 01:01:42.617
Yes.

01:01:43.326 --> 01:01:44.327
Flight.

01:01:44.744 --> 01:01:46.205
View on them.

01:02:07.022 --> 01:02:08.064
They are gone.

01:02:08.148 --> 01:02:10.985
No, no. It is just a spin.
They come back.

01:02:11.068 --> 01:02:12.735
- Is it true?
- Yes, I promise.

01:02:12.738 --> 01:02:16.326
Swan chicks must build
enough strength before they can move.

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:18.243
I'll tell you one thing,

01:02:18.244 --> 01:02:20.956
I'm so sure that if you go there
waiting for them

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:23.207
so they are back in just a few minutes.

01:02:23.709 --> 01:02:24.710
Okay.

01:02:34.765 --> 01:02:37.267
When they move so follow after.

01:02:38.812 --> 01:02:39.938
Yes.

01:02:43.275 --> 01:02:46.946
I know we do not really
got a chance to talk about it,

01:02:48.949 --> 01:02:50.505
but I do not want you to go.

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:56.583
I have to, Jack.

01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:06.303
When they move, then?

01:03:08.472 --> 01:03:09.766
Any day.

01:03:27.827 --> 01:03:29.496
Come on, Charlie.

01:04:02.328 --> 01:04:06.041
Come. Dad said we have to meet the swans
because they soon stand.

01:04:06.125 --> 01:04:07.751
Let them fly.

01:04:07.835 --> 01:04:09.087
Stretch.

01:04:09.170 --> 01:04:11.948
- I told you she would not understand.
- What then?

01:04:12.717 --> 01:04:13.843
What I do not understand?

01:04:13.884 --> 01:04:15.803
Your little family fantasy is over, Frankie.

01:04:15.970 --> 01:04:18.598
When the swans are away stand even Ginny.

01:04:19.725 --> 01:04:21.892
It's not true. So she would never do.

01:04:21.893 --> 01:04:23.396
Why do not you grow up?

01:04:28.903 --> 01:04:30.848
I probably do not want to go there.

01:04:31.448 --> 01:04:33.908
Kyle, what if they do not come back.

01:04:34.368 --> 01:04:36.662
Do not you say goodbye?

01:04:36.746 --> 01:04:38.456
You can do it for me.

01:04:41.877 --> 01:04:42.919
But...

01:04:44.838 --> 01:04:48.469
birds from this region
usually stay here when they move,

01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:50.429
The Turnbull Wildlife Sanctuary.

01:04:50.471 --> 01:04:52.474
The resting and eating,

01:04:52.557 --> 01:04:56.311
then they fly to Oregon
for the winter in Wallowa Lake.

01:04:56.978 --> 01:04:58.606
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

01:05:10.954 --> 01:05:11.955
Ginny?

01:05:14.458 --> 01:05:15.960
Are you awake?

01:05:16.002 --> 01:05:17.128
Yes.

01:05:17.962 --> 01:05:22.969
Perhaps the swans thrive so well here
they do not even go to Oregon.

01:06:03.685 --> 01:06:05.479
I believe that they have moved.

01:06:11.028 --> 01:06:12.405
Have you told her?

01:06:14.157 --> 01:06:15.199
No.

01:06:18.329 --> 01:06:19.747
Okay.

01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:28.716
Thanks.

01:06:28.799 --> 01:06:30.802
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:06:52.128 --> 01:06:53.213
Frankie.

01:06:55.716 --> 01:06:57.134
Wake up, Frankie.

01:06:57.676 --> 01:06:58.970
Wake.

01:07:02.057 --> 01:07:03.684
- Hey, Dad.
- Hello.

01:07:07.522 --> 01:07:09.816
There is one thing I must tell you.

01:07:21.622 --> 01:07:22.791
Ginny.

01:07:24.168 --> 01:07:25.252
Ginny.

01:07:28.256 --> 01:07:29.674
Ginny, Ginny.

01:07:30.467 --> 01:07:33.345
- You must not go.
- I have it, Frankie.

01:07:33.429 --> 01:07:34.722
No, you must not.

01:07:35.723 --> 01:07:37.099
Listen, Frankie.

01:07:37.183 --> 01:07:39.728
I have to ensure that the birds
coming to Oregon, remember?

01:07:39.770 --> 01:07:41.689
But then you come back.

01:07:47.488 --> 01:07:49.114
Come on, Frankie. She must go now.

01:07:49.198 --> 01:07:50.491
No, she has not.

01:07:51.201 --> 01:07:52.201
No.

01:07:52.202 --> 01:07:53.495
Say bye, Frankie.

01:07:53.578 --> 01:07:55.455
- No!
- Frankie.

01:07:55.538 --> 01:07:57.208
Let her be just.

01:08:01.797 --> 01:08:03.132
Okay, say goodbye.

01:08:05.426 --> 01:08:06.511
Bye.

01:08:12.226 --> 01:08:13.895
I'm sorry, Jack.

01:08:17.774 --> 01:08:19.109
Bye, Ginny.

01:08:19.193 --> 01:08:20.821
Hope swans survive.

01:08:20.904 --> 01:08:23.948
- I'll call and tell you how it went.
- Okay.

01:08:28.246 --> 01:08:29.997
This is what I do.

01:08:31.041 --> 01:08:32.126
I know.

01:08:45.058 --> 01:08:46.643
I tried, Frankie.

01:08:47.978 --> 01:08:49.689
I tried to get her to stay.

01:08:51.274 --> 01:08:53.276
You tried not enough.

01:09:40.292 --> 01:09:44.881
THE TRUMPET OF THE SWAN
Hug, Frankie.

01:10:50.336 --> 01:10:53.257
<i>Ginny was long gone,
and I could not help but wonder,</i>

01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:57.428
<i>just like in Trumpet of the Swan,
if I would ever see them again.</i>

01:10:57.429 --> 01:11:01.016
<i>How will a bird from which he is
to where he wants to be?</i>

01:11:02.977 --> 01:11:04.437
I take it.

01:11:06.439 --> 01:11:08.108
- Hello?
- Frankie?

01:11:08.442 --> 01:11:09.443
Ginny.

01:11:10.861 --> 01:11:12.113
I miss you.

01:11:12.447 --> 01:11:13.824
Wait, I call on the father.

01:11:13.908 --> 01:11:15.826
No, no. Do not bother him.

01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:19.077
I just wanted to tell
that we have not seen the swans yet.

01:11:19.623 --> 01:11:21.457
Should they not be there now?

01:11:21.458 --> 01:11:22.876
It's Ginny.

01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:27.215
It's too early to worry about.
They move in stages, remember?

01:11:29.717 --> 01:11:31.304
Do you want to talk to Kyle?

01:11:32.263 --> 01:11:33.389
Sure.

01:11:34.474 --> 01:11:35.475
Hello.

01:11:36.435 --> 01:11:37.477
Talk to her, Dad.

01:11:37.478 --> 01:11:40.147
No, we are fine. We miss you.

01:11:40.231 --> 01:11:43.193
Let it just be Frankie.

01:12:41.222 --> 01:12:42.932
<i>Northwest wildlife management.</i>

01:12:43.016 --> 01:12:44.517
Ginny. This is Jack.

01:12:45.686 --> 01:12:46.854
Hello.

01:12:49.274 --> 01:12:51.027
How nice to hear your voice.

01:12:52.069 --> 01:12:53.237
<i>I miss you.</i>

01:12:53.321 --> 01:12:54.363
Ginny...

01:12:54.447 --> 01:12:58.327
I wanted to talk to you, but did not know
if you wanted to talk to me.

01:12:59.787 --> 01:13:02.080
I did not know it would be this.

01:13:02.122 --> 01:13:03.500
Listen, Ginny.

01:13:04.709 --> 01:13:06.586
I'm calling for...

01:13:08.047 --> 01:13:11.593
You cannot call for the kids more.

01:13:12.636 --> 01:13:16.557
<i>Frankie must go further,
and get over this,</i>

01:13:16.599 --> 01:13:20.020
<i>and you cannot if you call
every other day.</i>

01:13:22.314 --> 01:13:23.357
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:26.987
It's just...
There is much hope for her.

01:13:29.281 --> 01:13:30.616
Course.

01:13:35.372 --> 01:13:36.748
I understand.

01:13:41.754 --> 01:13:42.923
Thanks.

01:13:43.090 --> 01:13:44.716
- Jack.
- Yes.

01:13:47.011 --> 01:13:48.639
Do me a favor,

01:13:49.765 --> 01:13:53.210
and tell the children
that three of the swans appeared tonight.

01:13:54.855 --> 01:13:56.648
All except Charlie.

01:13:57.858 --> 01:14:00.444
I was going to call tomorrow morning, but...

01:14:01.445 --> 01:14:03.531
Talk to Frankie. Okay?

01:14:03.614 --> 01:14:05.033
I'll do that.

01:14:06.161 --> 01:14:07.245
Okay.

01:14:11.166 --> 01:14:12.251
Bye.

01:14:14.211 --> 01:14:15.588
Bye.

01:14:47.419 --> 01:14:49.004
Hi.

01:14:49.087 --> 01:14:50.672
How is the situation?

01:14:50.714 --> 01:14:52.717
I've talked to Ginny.

01:14:54.886 --> 01:14:57.430
She said swans finally arrived,

01:14:57.514 --> 01:14:59.266
so everything is good.

01:15:00.476 --> 01:15:03.564
And she will not call more.

01:15:03.648 --> 01:15:08.194
So we must return to our normal lives.

01:15:08.277 --> 01:15:09.278
Did she say that?

01:15:09.613 --> 01:15:11.739
- Did she say that she should not make more?
- Yes, Frankie.

01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:14.993
The swans are there, so then it's all over.

01:15:15.077 --> 01:15:16.746
Feel the good?

01:15:18.414 --> 01:15:20.041
Only two of the kids arrived.

01:15:20.124 --> 01:15:21.544
- Only two?
- Only two?

01:15:22.212 --> 01:15:25.340
He certainly lost during the move.

01:15:26.759 --> 01:15:31.973
But two out of three is good proportions.

01:15:32.474 --> 01:15:34.059
What was it?

01:15:34.643 --> 01:15:36.061
- Charlie.
- Charlie?

01:15:39.524 --> 01:15:40.733
I want to call Ginny.

01:15:40.775 --> 01:15:43.028
No, no. It's over, Frankie.

01:15:43.112 --> 01:15:45.073
Ginny would say the same thing.

01:15:45.157 --> 01:15:47.102
We must let nature take its course.

01:16:10.437 --> 01:16:12.606
Someone will have problems.

01:16:13.149 --> 01:16:14.859
Okay, the bus is on the way up the hill.

01:16:14.942 --> 01:16:17.486
Frankie would do lunch.

01:16:17.570 --> 01:16:18.822
Jeez.

01:16:19.949 --> 01:16:21.951
She bulls well still.

01:16:23.244 --> 01:16:25.497
- Okay, here.
- Thanks.

01:16:25.581 --> 01:16:26.832
Thanks.

01:16:38.054 --> 01:16:39.389
Dad!

01:16:41.475 --> 01:16:42.560
Dad!

01:16:43.478 --> 01:16:44.938
One of quad cars are gone.

01:17:35.541 --> 01:17:39.254
This is Frankie for about
a year late, but... it should work.

01:17:39.337 --> 01:17:40.423
There are good.

01:17:40.464 --> 01:17:41.591
Glen.

01:17:42.091 --> 01:17:44.385
Do not worry. She runs out of petrol.

01:17:44.468 --> 01:17:46.054
She gets scared and huddle somewhere,

01:17:46.096 --> 01:17:48.307
- hope she is found before dark.
- Hope so.

01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:49.850
Yes. Excuse me.

01:17:53.897 --> 01:18:00.405
Missing - Frankie Peterson
call the police.

01:18:21.181 --> 01:18:22.849
Patches are sent out.

01:18:22.933 --> 01:18:27.063
We have already received calls if the ATV
here in Mink, and here, west of Gold Creek.

01:18:27.146 --> 01:18:29.315
We'll check it out now.

01:18:29.398 --> 01:18:30.733
Okay.

01:18:38.077 --> 01:18:40.746
TURNBULL Wildlife Sanctuary.

01:20:14.936 --> 01:20:16.022
Hello.

01:20:16.355 --> 01:20:17.648
I brought you some coffee.

01:20:17.732 --> 01:20:18.983
- Thanks.
- Yes.

01:20:20.067 --> 01:20:22.456
- Do not worry, we'll find her.
- I hope so.

01:20:22.529 --> 01:20:25.072
Please, get out of here. Okay?

01:20:25.073 --> 01:20:26.366
Sure.

01:20:27.202 --> 01:20:28.244
Thanks.

01:20:31.081 --> 01:20:33.084
I think we have something.

01:20:49.437 --> 01:20:51.899
<i>I'm going down for a closer look.</i>

01:20:53.108 --> 01:20:55.110
<i>It's the right color of the vehicle.</i>

01:20:56.655 --> 01:20:59.950
<i>Wait, I think I see something
moving in the woods.</i>

01:21:00.784 --> 01:21:03.287
Away from here! What are you doing?

01:21:04.288 --> 01:21:06.499
Away from here!

01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:10.380
I had a perfect shooting position!

01:21:10.463 --> 01:21:12.131
<i>It was wrong.</i>

01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:14.677
<i>It's an adult hunter.</i>

01:21:15.761 --> 01:21:17.012
<i>I'm running back.</i>

01:21:17.096 --> 01:21:18.597
It was a shame.

01:21:19.349 --> 01:21:20.809
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:21:38.622 --> 01:21:40.165
Come on.

01:21:43.378 --> 01:21:45.046
Do not do this.

01:21:55.059 --> 01:21:56.185
Move to you.

01:22:39.112 --> 01:22:40.782
Where are you?

01:22:52.797 --> 01:22:54.048
Charlie!

01:22:55.091 --> 01:22:56.342
Charlie!

01:23:34.097 --> 01:23:35.307
Northwest wildlife management.

01:23:35.557 --> 01:23:36.850
Ginny, it's Jack.

01:23:37.309 --> 01:23:39.754
Hey, Jack. I did not think
I'd hear from you.

01:23:39.770 --> 01:23:41.647
<i>You, Frankie is gone.</i>

01:23:41.731 --> 01:23:42.858
What?

01:23:45.102 --> 01:23:47.271
Keep evenly spaced.

01:23:47.313 --> 01:23:48.689
Frankie.

01:23:49.065 --> 01:23:51.777
Make sure you communicate
with those around you.

01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:53.445
Did everyone hear?

01:23:54.112 --> 01:23:56.783
Look for marks in the grass.

01:23:56.824 --> 01:24:00.244
If there is something to hold
or seem strange,

01:24:00.787 --> 01:24:03.750
ask one from the emergency
take a look at it.

01:24:04.084 --> 01:24:05.085
Frankie.

01:24:21.605 --> 01:24:23.440
- Have you seen this girl?
- No.

01:24:23.524 --> 01:24:24.901
Okay, thanks.

01:24:43.215 --> 01:24:45.993
- Thanks for coming.
- We will find her. I promise.

01:24:46.051 --> 01:24:48.013
Okay. Come on.

01:24:48.096 --> 01:24:51.016
Groups that are out
is down here around Lincoln and Drummond.

01:24:51.099 --> 01:24:53.853
Lincoln? No, you're looking
in the wrong place.

01:24:54.020 --> 01:24:57.856
Sorry, I have organized
part, the passages in my time.

01:24:57.857 --> 01:25:00.153
We start from where she was last seen

01:25:00.236 --> 01:25:02.780
and work our way forward in all directions.

01:25:02.864 --> 01:25:05.117
We have gone through every house
and every little bit forest

01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:06.868
within a radius of 5 miles so far...

01:25:06.869 --> 01:25:09.413
No, no. She has not escaped.
She's looking for Charlie.

01:25:09.496 --> 01:25:11.124
Here, in Turnbull.

01:25:11.416 --> 01:25:14.210
- Charlie?
- Charlie is a young trumpet swan.

01:25:15.045 --> 01:25:16.964
Turnbull is 1.5 mil from here.

01:25:17.048 --> 01:25:19.426
There is a ten-year-old girl concerned.

01:25:19.468 --> 01:25:21.763
While you are entitled
, and she is looking a bird

01:25:21.846 --> 01:25:22.888
she cannot have come so far.

01:25:22.889 --> 01:25:24.682
I promise, this is where she is.

01:25:24.766 --> 01:25:28.322
We have talked about it.
I showed her migratory route on the map.

01:25:28.896 --> 01:25:30.814
Did I would have taken me.

01:25:31.648 --> 01:25:33.651
Dad. I think she's right.

01:25:35.070 --> 01:25:36.196
Okay.

01:25:41.661 --> 01:25:43.205
- You drive.
- Okay.

01:25:44.206 --> 01:25:47.627
Stretch, stay here and take care of Kyle.

01:25:48.127 --> 01:25:49.420
Okay.

01:26:29.970 --> 01:26:32.223
Hey, Lester. This is
Frankie's dad, Jack.

01:26:32.306 --> 01:26:34.975
Lester comes from Turnbull.
He knows the place.

01:26:34.976 --> 01:26:37.105
- Jack.
- Nice of you to come.

01:26:37.188 --> 01:26:38.355
Hoping to be helpful.

01:26:38.356 --> 01:26:40.942
Turnbull is an 20,700-hectare area.

01:26:40.984 --> 01:26:42.987
Just a dirt road is passable.
Then you have to go.

01:26:43.028 --> 01:26:44.613
She will be near the water.

01:26:44.697 --> 01:26:46.574
Yes. It makes it a lot easier.

01:26:46.657 --> 01:26:50.746
There is a maze of marshes,
bogs, ponds, rivers.

01:26:50.829 --> 01:26:52.539
- Where should we start?
- We take the upper lake.

01:26:52.581 --> 01:26:54.709
I take the east, you West. Here.

01:26:55.544 --> 01:26:56.587
Stay in touch.

01:26:56.670 --> 01:26:58.170
- Thank you, Lester.
- Okay.

01:27:28.416 --> 01:27:29.460
Frankie!

01:27:29.919 --> 01:27:30.920
Frankie!

01:27:31.003 --> 01:27:33.047
We drive a little further up.

01:27:33.089 --> 01:27:34.216
Okay.

01:27:44.770 --> 01:27:47.941
If they are at the upper lake,
it helps when we're on this page?

01:27:48.024 --> 01:27:49.734
Box, the guys are here.

01:27:57.745 --> 01:27:59.622
- Hey, have you heard anything?
- Hello.

01:27:59.664 --> 01:28:02.041
No, we just came from the sheriff.
Nothing new.

01:28:02.083 --> 01:28:03.710
We have not heard anything.

01:28:03.794 --> 01:28:06.087
- Do you have distributed the patches?
- Yeah yeah.

01:28:06.088 --> 01:28:08.924
We will find her. Okay?

01:28:09.007 --> 01:28:10.009
Okay.

01:28:10.718 --> 01:28:14.640
<i>Here in southeast Washington is at 10.20.</i>

01:28:14.682 --> 01:28:19.938
<i>And Frances Peterson, ten-year loan
from Blue Bunch Falls, are still missing.</i>

01:28:20.063 --> 01:28:22.841
<i>Search Management says it looks
bleaker by the hour</i>

01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:27.239
<i>given the lack of progress
and the temperature drops.</i>

01:28:27.322 --> 01:28:30.159
<i>Do you have someone
information about the missing girl</i>

01:28:30.242 --> 01:28:33.122
<i>please contact the Washington police.</i>

01:28:36.417 --> 01:28:38.417
She is a tough and smart girl, Jack.

01:28:39.045 --> 01:28:41.823
- We do not even know if she's here.
- I know that.

01:28:43.801 --> 01:28:45.178
I know that.

01:28:47.138 --> 01:28:48.681
<i>Ginny. Are you there?</i>

01:28:49.850 --> 01:28:51.394
Lester, go ahead.

01:28:51.978 --> 01:28:55.524
I have a quad here.
The eastern shore of Upper Lake.

01:28:57.109 --> 01:28:58.861
What is the license plate?

01:28:58.944 --> 01:29:00.154
<i>Wait.</i>

01:29:04.242 --> 01:29:08.664
Okay. Washington OX, as in X-ray

01:29:08.706 --> 01:29:11.167
<i>- 1-I-3.</i>
- This is Frankie.

01:29:11.168 --> 01:29:14.422
There she is. Continue around the lake,
and see you on the other side.

01:29:14.506 --> 01:29:15.673
I do. Over and out.

01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:28.221
- We will find her.
- I hope so.

01:30:31.099 --> 01:30:32.267
Frankie.

01:30:33.436 --> 01:30:34.812
Watch out, folks.

01:30:54.503 --> 01:30:55.796
Charlie.

01:30:57.965 --> 01:30:59.300
Charlie.

01:31:20.993 --> 01:31:22.537
What? What is it?

01:31:24.915 --> 01:31:26.876
I think I saw something.

01:31:47.151 --> 01:31:48.360
Frankie.

01:31:50.113 --> 01:31:51.364
Dad.

01:31:52.365 --> 01:31:53.366
I found him.

01:31:54.117 --> 01:31:56.912
I found him, Dad. He was injured.

01:31:59.165 --> 01:32:01.168
I know I will get the bark.

01:32:01.251 --> 01:32:02.962
No, sweetheart.

01:32:03.045 --> 01:32:05.089
You should not.

01:32:05.173 --> 01:32:07.396
You did the right thing did not give up.

01:32:07.759 --> 01:32:09.871
Sometimes nature needs a helping hand.

01:32:10.721 --> 01:32:11.806
Hello.

01:32:13.725 --> 01:32:14.726
Hello.

01:32:14.809 --> 01:32:16.394
I was so scared.

01:32:18.355 --> 01:32:20.733
Your mother would be
very proud of you now.

01:32:20.816 --> 01:32:21.942
Okay?

01:32:27.700 --> 01:32:29.161
What about him?

01:32:30.579 --> 01:32:32.414
He has a damaged wing,

01:32:33.415 --> 01:32:34.415
but he feels good.

01:32:34.416 --> 01:32:36.503
You did a great job, Frankie.

01:32:42.969 --> 01:32:44.888
Can we go home now?

01:32:49.101 --> 01:32:50.353
Yes.

01:32:52.606 --> 01:32:54.441
Yes, we can go home.

01:33:18.679 --> 01:33:20.472
<i>It was a nice wedding.</i>

01:33:20.473 --> 01:33:23.227
<i>Then I got Ginny's father to put up
a new observation area,</i>

01:33:23.310 --> 01:33:25.521
<i>on our side of the ground this time.</i>

01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:30.026
<i>But there's a big world, and I was
worried, swans do not read the signs.</i>

01:33:30.068 --> 01:33:32.279
NORTHWEST wildlife management
Blue Bunch Falls, Washington.

01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:36.320
<i>Ginny insisted, however, on
Charlie and the Fighting Falcon and the other</i>

01:33:36.367 --> 01:33:38.495
<i>would come back and see us.</i>

01:34:10.201 --> 01:34:12.161
Hey, they're back.

01:34:27.472 --> 01:34:30.684
<i>Sometimes you have to fight
for its happy ending.</i>

01:34:30.768 --> 01:34:34.713
<i>The mother knew about, and Fighting Falcon
also seemed to know about it.</i>

01:34:36.274 --> 01:34:40.571
<i>When he came back with Alfa,
Bravo and Charlie, was the one.</i>

01:34:41.656 --> 01:34:43.575
<i>F-16 had a new partner.</i>

01:34:44.368 --> 01:34:47.580
<i>And Dad could finally joke about
that nature had its time.</i>

01:34:51.376 --> 01:34:53.879
We seem to be back up and running, huh?

01:35:02.682 --> 01:35:04.852
I told you they'd come back.
