00:00.439 --> 00:03.139
<i>
Previously on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:03.174 --> 00:05.375
For your next challenge,
you'll be creating

00:05.409 --> 00:08.178
a tasting menu
for Brianna's Quinceanera.

00:08.212 --> 00:09.779
It may have
been a close matchup...

00:09.813 --> 00:11.080
I like both of them.

00:11.115 --> 00:12.115
But in the end...

00:12.149 --> 00:13.149
Prefer the red team
or blue team?

00:13.184 --> 00:14.350
Red team.

00:16.487 --> 00:18.488
It was the seventh
humiliating loss for the men.

00:18.522 --> 00:20.089
Each of you are going
to take a doll to dress.

00:20.124 --> 00:23.293
Maybe I can glue some
of my manhood back together.

00:23.327 --> 00:25.428
For the
Quinceanera dinner service,

00:25.462 --> 00:27.096
Hell's Kitchen was transformed

00:27.131 --> 00:30.667
into a palace
fit for a princess.

00:30.701 --> 00:31.868
But Amanda's fish...

00:31.902 --> 00:32.869
<i> Where's the tuna?</i>

00:32.903 --> 00:34.037
Come on then, Amanda.

00:34.071 --> 00:37.373
Was a royal nightmare.

00:37.408 --> 00:38.541
And she wasted no time...

00:38.576 --> 00:40.610
Nedra seared it.

00:40.644 --> 00:41.678
Pointing the finger at Nedra.

00:41.712 --> 00:43.246
I did not take it
off the pan, chef.

00:43.280 --> 00:45.448
While the
turmoil in the red kitchen

00:45.482 --> 00:46.883
threatened to ruin
the evening...

00:46.917 --> 00:48.518
This is an absolute joke.

00:48.552 --> 00:49.619
The men, early on,

00:49.653 --> 00:51.688
were knights in shining armor.

00:51.722 --> 00:53.122
<i>
I've sent blue team appetizers.</i>

00:54.225 --> 00:55.558
<i>I love you, man.</i>

00:55.593 --> 00:57.126
But when it
was time for entrees...

00:57.161 --> 00:58.194
Taste that.
Get in there.

00:58.229 --> 00:59.262
<i>Get in, get in, get in.</i>

00:59.296 --> 01:02.899
Barret's linguini
brought the kitchen to a halt.

01:02.933 --> 01:04.233
And Zach...

01:04.268 --> 01:05.768
I told you,
get lots of potatoes on.

01:05.803 --> 01:07.537
Couldn't get a
handle on his potatoes...

01:07.571 --> 01:09.839
I gave you some already.
Calm down.

01:09.873 --> 01:10.873
Or his mouth.

01:10.908 --> 01:12.542
Hey, smart ass.
Come here, you.

01:12.576 --> 01:14.077
You're just killing us
for nothing.

01:14.111 --> 01:15.345
But it was Cyndi's raw meat...

01:15.379 --> 01:16.613
This rib-eye's

01:16.647 --> 01:18.214
still got its horns on.

01:18.249 --> 01:20.083
That brought chef Ramsay

01:20.117 --> 01:21.918
to his boiling point.
She can't cook.

01:21.952 --> 01:23.886
And you're on fire.

01:23.921 --> 01:25.421
Both teams had to nominate

01:25.456 --> 01:27.023
two chefs for elimination.

01:27.057 --> 01:28.124
Barret.
And...

01:28.158 --> 01:29.325
<i>Zach.
Amanda.</i>

01:29.360 --> 01:30.393
And...
Cyndi.

01:30.427 --> 01:31.694
Were nominated.

01:31.729 --> 01:32.895
But in the end...
Amanda.

01:32.930 --> 01:34.163
Give me your jacket.

01:34.198 --> 01:35.865
Amanda lost her chance

01:35.899 --> 01:37.400
to become head chef
at Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill

01:37.434 --> 01:39.969
at Caesars Palace.

01:40.004 --> 01:42.805
But chef Ramsay
wasn't content with just that.

01:42.840 --> 01:44.507
I am not done.

01:44.541 --> 01:45.508
Find out what he's thinking...

01:45.542 --> 01:47.210
My decision is...

01:47.244 --> 01:48.544
Right now.

01:49.780 --> 01:50.747
* Fire

01:50.781 --> 01:53.082
Whoa...

01:53.117 --> 01:56.019
* The way you swerve
and curve *

01:56.053 --> 01:57.854
* really wrecks my nerves

01:57.888 --> 02:00.223
* and I'm so excited, child
ohh!

02:00.257 --> 02:02.358
<i>Go, Jon!</i>

02:02.393 --> 02:05.194
* When you take
what you've got *

02:05.229 --> 02:07.163
* and, girl, you've got a lot *

02:07.197 --> 02:08.631
* you're really somethin',
child *

02:11.502 --> 02:14.437
* When you're hot, you're hot *

02:14.471 --> 02:16.272
* you really shoot your shot

02:16.307 --> 02:18.174
* you're dynamite, child

02:18.208 --> 02:19.976
* yeah

02:20.010 --> 02:23.046
* well, I can tell
by your game *

02:23.080 --> 02:25.848
* you're gonna start a flame *

02:25.883 --> 02:28.918
* of love, baby, baby

02:28.952 --> 02:32.422
* the way you push, push

02:32.456 --> 02:34.023
* lets me know that

02:34.058 --> 02:35.391
Hey, hey!

02:36.493 --> 02:37.527
* You're gonna get your wish *

02:37.561 --> 02:39.395
* oh, no

02:39.430 --> 02:41.164
* fire

02:41.198 --> 02:43.199
* what I said, child

02:43.233 --> 02:46.469
* oww, fire

02:46.503 --> 02:48.338
* uh-huh

02:48.372 --> 02:52.308
* got me burning,
burning, burning *

02:55.747 --> 02:57.647
And now, the continuation

02:57.681 --> 02:58.715
<i>of Hell's Kitchen.</i>

02:58.749 --> 03:00.049
Tonight was a disaster,

03:00.084 --> 03:02.185
<i>an embarrament.</i>

03:02.219 --> 03:05.922
And that is why I am not done.

03:05.956 --> 03:08.224
Cyndi, there's a trend
that's just...

03:08.258 --> 03:09.492
I'm with it, chef.

03:09.526 --> 03:10.860
It's definitely not a trend.
Trust me.

03:10.894 --> 03:12.595
What guarantee can you give me

03:12.629 --> 03:15.298
<i>that you are not
on the decline?</i>

03:15.332 --> 03:16.632
You have to take
my word right now,

03:16.667 --> 03:19.435
<i>and then I'll have
to prove it to you.</i>

03:19.470 --> 03:22.171
Back in line.
Thank you.

03:22.206 --> 03:24.807
Blue team, how would you rate
Zach's performance tonight?

03:24.842 --> 03:26.642
Michael, tell me.
Two.

03:26.677 --> 03:28.678
<i>A two. Jon?</i>

03:28.712 --> 03:30.246
<i>Three.
Three.</i>

03:30.280 --> 03:31.414
<i>Ray?</i>

03:31.448 --> 03:32.482
<i>Three.
Three.</i>

03:32.516 --> 03:33.750
<i>Anthony.</i>

03:33.784 --> 03:36.185
Two, chef.
That's generous.

03:36.220 --> 03:39.322
<i>Zach, ten seconds</i>

03:39.356 --> 03:41.391
on what this means for you.

03:41.425 --> 03:42.558
This means everything to me.

03:42.593 --> 03:43.926
<i>I love being a chef.</i>

03:43.961 --> 03:45.795
That's where my heart is.
That's where my passion is.

03:45.829 --> 03:51.067
Honestly, I'm not feeling it.

03:51.101 --> 03:52.235
<i>Barret.
Yes, chef.</i>

03:52.269 --> 03:54.804
Ten seconds,
what this means to you.

03:54.838 --> 03:56.406
To be here, working under you,

03:56.440 --> 03:57.673
is the reason
why I started cooking.

03:57.708 --> 03:59.609
Aren't you over your head?
Negative.

03:59.643 --> 04:00.877
<i>I don't quit.</i>

04:00.911 --> 04:03.546
I don't give up.

04:03.580 --> 04:07.083
The person leaving
Hell's Kitchen...

04:12.923 --> 04:14.424
Barret, give me your jacket.

04:14.458 --> 04:17.959
<i>Your time is done
in Hell's Kitchen.</i>

04:19.000 --> 04:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:26.003 --> 04:27.370
I don't agree
with the decision,

04:27.404 --> 04:28.805
but I really
can't be upset with myself,

04:28.839 --> 04:30.840
because I did everything
I possibly could.

04:30.874 --> 04:32.442
I think I could have
made it further,

04:32.476 --> 04:34.243
but I didn't do it
quick enough for chef.

04:34.278 --> 04:36.112
<i> Start stepping up,</i>

04:36.146 --> 04:38.881
'cause my patience
is running out.

04:38.916 --> 04:40.249
Yes, chef.

04:40.284 --> 04:43.519
Now off.

04:43.554 --> 04:47.056
My team crossed me.
You made a big mistake.

04:47.090 --> 04:48.858
If you was on fire, I wouldn't
put you out with.

04:48.892 --> 04:51.093
It's not even the blue team
no more.

04:51.128 --> 04:53.429
It's team Zach.

04:53.464 --> 04:57.600
Well, I'm glad
you're still here, Zach.

05:00.838 --> 05:02.138
Zach's pissed.

05:02.172 --> 05:03.539
I personally
don't give a.

05:03.574 --> 05:06.242
<i>Zach.</i>

05:06.276 --> 05:07.577
Don't speak to me.
Don't say.

05:07.611 --> 05:09.512
I'll hold onto a grudge
forever.

05:09.546 --> 05:11.280
You all right?
Yup.

05:11.315 --> 05:13.549
You sure?
Heck, yeah.

05:13.584 --> 05:17.453
I'm coming for your head.
You're done.

05:17.488 --> 05:18.988
Is this an old wives' tale?

05:19.022 --> 05:21.991
This stress
is really affecting my skin.

05:22.025 --> 05:23.559
You have enough eggs
for my face?

05:23.594 --> 05:25.194
Nedra apparently has

05:25.229 --> 05:27.129
an answer
to all of my problems.

05:27.164 --> 05:29.065
Do I need to wash it off first?

05:29.099 --> 05:31.033
My grandma told me,
if you crack an egg open

05:31.068 --> 05:32.435
and put it on a pimple,

05:32.469 --> 05:34.370
it'll draw it to a head.

05:34.404 --> 05:36.272
I have egg on my face.

05:36.306 --> 05:38.341
While the time in the dorms

05:38.375 --> 05:40.743
has hardly gone off
without a blemish...

05:42.546 --> 05:44.580
With a new day...
Let's go, red team.

05:44.615 --> 05:45.781
What the is that?

05:45.816 --> 05:48.550
Comes a new opportunity
for these chefs to prove

05:48.587 --> 05:50.865
they have what it takes
to chef Ramsay.

05:50.900 --> 05:52.722
My next head chef
needs to deliver

05:52.756 --> 05:55.992
great taste
and great presentation.

05:56.026 --> 05:59.428
<i>You should be able
to pull an amazing dish</i>

05:59.463 --> 06:01.364
right out of thin air.

06:01.398 --> 06:02.832
<i>Got it?
Yes, chef.</i>

06:02.866 --> 06:04.867
<i>Oh, God.</i>

06:08.772 --> 06:10.306
Jean-Philippe is in the booth,

06:10.340 --> 06:11.741
and he's getting
the stuff all over,

06:11.775 --> 06:12.942
grabbing this and this.

06:12.976 --> 06:14.043
They all have ingredients

06:14.077 --> 06:15.478
written at random, okay?

06:15.512 --> 06:16.979
<i>Gold papers, protein.</i>

06:17.014 --> 06:18.648
<i>White papers, vegetables.</i>

06:18.682 --> 06:20.816
These represent the ingredients

06:20.851 --> 06:22.184
that you'll cook with
in your next challenge.

06:22.219 --> 06:24.086
Got it?
Yes, chef.

06:24.121 --> 06:26.188
<i>
One individual from each team</i>

06:26.223 --> 06:28.424
<i>will gather as many ingredients</i>

06:28.458 --> 06:29.859
<i>as they can for their team.</i>

06:29.893 --> 06:31.727
<i>You're gonna have 45 minutes</i>

06:31.762 --> 06:35.665
to create your individual
stunning dishes.

06:35.699 --> 06:37.366
Now get out of there.

06:37.401 --> 06:39.001
Let's start with Susan.

06:39.036 --> 06:40.403
Let's go, Susie!

06:40.437 --> 06:42.138
I'm confident in my ability
to stay calm

06:42.172 --> 06:44.607
under pressure,
so I'm ready to go,

06:44.641 --> 06:46.008
but I am very nervous.

06:46.043 --> 06:47.510
Go, Susie!
All right!

06:47.544 --> 06:49.812
Go!
Let's go!

06:49.846 --> 06:51.047
<i>Come on, Susan.</i>

06:51.081 --> 06:52.648
Right there.

06:52.683 --> 06:54.116
He should have picked me

06:54.151 --> 06:55.585
to go in the cube.

06:55.619 --> 06:56.752
I could have just laid
against the glass

06:56.787 --> 06:58.955
with my hoo-has
and just put everything

06:58.989 --> 07:01.791
in the bag.
And stop.

07:01.825 --> 07:03.192
<i>Good job.
Good job, Susan.</i>

07:03.226 --> 07:04.360
Thank you.
Wow.

07:04.394 --> 07:05.561
<i>Way to go.</i>

07:05.596 --> 07:06.762
<i> Good job.
Okay, blue team.</i>

07:06.797 --> 07:08.130
<i>Thank you.
Anthony.</i>

07:08.165 --> 07:09.999
Let's go, bubba.

07:10.033 --> 07:11.434
It's up to me to lean over,
grab what I can.

07:11.468 --> 07:13.402
Cake.

07:13.437 --> 07:14.870
Now I want cake.

07:14.905 --> 07:16.172
Go!

07:16.206 --> 07:17.473
<i>Let's go.
Come on, Anthony.</i>

07:17.507 --> 07:18.708
<i>
Did he take his glasses off?</i>

07:18.742 --> 07:21.110
Where are his glasses?

07:21.144 --> 07:22.445
Dude, can you even
see the tickets?

07:22.479 --> 07:25.615
<i> And stop, Anthony.</i>

07:25.649 --> 07:26.749
Good job.

07:26.783 --> 07:28.985
Good job, man.

07:29.019 --> 07:30.786
I got a lot of proteins,
but at the same time,

07:30.821 --> 07:32.688
who knows what kind of
sides I got?

07:32.723 --> 07:34.657
<i> Each of you are
responsible for a stunning dish.</i>

07:34.691 --> 07:36.592
In each dish there should be

07:36.627 --> 07:38.961
a maximum of five ingredients.
Clear?

07:38.996 --> 07:40.062
Yes, chef!

07:40.097 --> 07:41.597
Your time starts now.

07:41.632 --> 07:43.032
<i> Go, go, go, go.</i>

07:43.066 --> 07:44.767
For today's
challenge, each chef

07:44.801 --> 07:47.436
must prepare a dish
that is not only delicious

07:47.471 --> 07:48.771
but is visually stunning...

07:48.805 --> 07:50.406
You want the salmon?
Yeah.

07:50.440 --> 07:52.441
Using five ingredients
from the numerous choices

07:52.476 --> 07:53.709
that are in each team's bag.

07:53.744 --> 07:55.144
All right, I got my five.

07:55.178 --> 07:56.212
Can we pick?
Everybody just pick something, man.

07:56.246 --> 07:57.380
I want lobster.

07:57.414 --> 07:59.181
I know what I'm gonna do.
There he is.

07:59.216 --> 08:00.983
In Boston, every place you go

08:01.018 --> 08:02.551
has baked stuffed lobster.

08:02.586 --> 08:03.886
It's like serving water
with your dinner.

08:03.920 --> 08:05.521
I got a duck breast and legs.

08:05.555 --> 08:06.522
New York strip.

08:06.556 --> 08:07.723
I got this halibut right here.

08:07.758 --> 08:10.693
I'm doing a simple
baked stuffed lobster.

08:10.727 --> 08:12.261
What are you doing, Mary?

08:12.295 --> 08:14.296
I'm doing my flank steak
with wasabi.

08:14.331 --> 08:16.165
I decide I want to go
kind of the Asian route.

08:16.199 --> 08:19.068
But I don't want it to be
hunks of meat on the plate.

08:19.102 --> 08:20.269
It's about presentation.

08:20.303 --> 08:22.304
I'm gonna do
a fennel-dusted sea bass.

08:22.339 --> 08:24.173
Oh, nice.

08:25.509 --> 08:26.976
<i> Are you okay?</i>

08:27.010 --> 08:28.678
Yeah.

08:28.712 --> 08:30.246
<i>You all right, Cyn?
Yup, I'm good.</i>

08:30.280 --> 08:33.115
I'm good.

08:33.150 --> 08:34.683
Yeah, please taste it.

08:34.717 --> 08:36.284
The flavor's great.

08:36.318 --> 08:37.453
It's big, it's vibrant,
it's bold.

08:37.486 --> 08:38.688
Boom, there it is.

08:38.722 --> 08:39.955
Visually, if it's not stunning,

08:39.990 --> 08:41.090
I may not even taste it, okay?

08:41.124 --> 08:42.158
Yes, chef.

08:42.192 --> 08:43.659
Should I just leave it
the way it is?

08:43.693 --> 08:44.660
So far right there?

08:44.695 --> 08:45.795
Yeah, but that's not...

08:45.829 --> 08:46.796
you know he don't like
that.

08:46.830 --> 08:48.297
I don't know what the

08:48.331 --> 08:49.498
Ray's thinking
with that lobster.

08:49.533 --> 08:51.267
This isn't the party portions
challenge.

08:51.301 --> 08:53.035
Last two minutes.

08:53.070 --> 08:54.437
How are we looking?
How are we looking?

08:54.471 --> 08:55.671
Good.

08:55.706 --> 08:57.740
<i>
That flank steak is huge.</i>

08:57.774 --> 08:59.308
<i> I'm gonna cut it in
half and do two pieces.</i>

08:59.342 --> 09:01.077
<i> Blue team, red
team, start plating.</i>

09:01.111 --> 09:02.712
I'm gonna start slicing.

09:02.746 --> 09:05.414
Visually stunning,
or he won't taste it, guys.

09:05.449 --> 09:07.750
Beauty on a plate
is simplicity.

09:07.784 --> 09:10.386
I'm not gonna butcher my meat.

09:10.420 --> 09:11.454
How do you guys like this?

09:11.488 --> 09:12.755
Does this look okay?

09:12.789 --> 09:14.390
Yours looks awesome.
It's cooked perfectly.

09:14.424 --> 09:16.459
<i>My dish looks great.
Five...</i>

09:16.493 --> 09:17.960
Walking together.
Let's go.

09:17.994 --> 09:19.562
<i> Four...
Come on, Nedra.</i>

09:19.596 --> 09:21.330
<i>Three...</i>

09:21.364 --> 09:23.699
<i>Two, one.</i>

09:23.734 --> 09:27.236
<i>And stop.</i>

09:27.270 --> 09:29.371
Okay, do you all feel confident
with your dishes?

09:29.406 --> 09:30.439
Yes, chef.

09:30.474 --> 09:33.809
Good, because helping me judge

09:33.844 --> 09:35.478
is a senior writer
for a publication

09:35.512 --> 09:39.715
that reaches
over 42 million readers.

09:39.750 --> 09:42.718
<i>Of course, I'm talking
about People Magazine.</i>

09:42.753 --> 09:44.120
Wow.

09:44.154 --> 09:46.055
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

09:46.089 --> 09:47.857
<i> Joining me today</i>

09:47.891 --> 09:49.558
is Jennifer Garcia.

09:51.228 --> 09:53.129
Thank you so much
for coming back.

09:53.163 --> 09:54.797
Good to see you.

09:54.831 --> 09:56.332
<i>And thank you so much.
Thank you.</i>

09:56.366 --> 09:58.400
Jennifer and I are going
to determine

09:58.435 --> 10:00.436
which three dishes
from the red team

10:00.470 --> 10:03.072
and the blue team are
the most visually stunning.

10:03.106 --> 10:05.541
<i>We will only be tasting
those three from each team.</i>

10:06.843 --> 10:08.310
My dish is beautiful.

10:08.345 --> 10:10.112
It's a great dish, so I know
it's gonna be picked.

10:10.147 --> 10:11.213
One more thing...

10:11.248 --> 10:12.815
<i>the chef today</i>

10:12.849 --> 10:15.151
<i>with the best dish
on the winning team</i>

10:15.185 --> 10:16.786
<i>will be featured
in People Magazine.</i>

10:16.820 --> 10:18.621
Wow.
That's awesome.

10:18.655 --> 10:21.157
Wow.

10:21.191 --> 10:23.392
<i>People Magazine
is huge globally.</i>

10:23.426 --> 10:26.128
Jennifer, let's start off
with the red team, shall we?

10:26.163 --> 10:27.196
At this point
in the competition,

10:27.230 --> 10:29.098
chef Ramsay wants to
hammer home

10:29.132 --> 10:31.700
to the chefs the importance
of presentation.

10:31.735 --> 10:33.702
That is why
he will only be tasting

10:33.737 --> 10:36.705
the three best-looking dishes
from each team.

10:36.740 --> 10:38.474
Visually, you didn't want
to slice that?

10:38.508 --> 10:40.576
I mean, we're talking
about presentation.

10:40.610 --> 10:41.744
I did like the heartiness
of the way...

10:41.778 --> 10:43.512
Sure.
I mean, the protein's big,

10:43.547 --> 10:44.880
so I think
I would have preferred it

10:44.915 --> 10:46.782
to be sliced as well.

10:46.817 --> 10:47.983
<i> Nedra, I said
visually stunning.</i>

10:48.018 --> 10:49.318
Why would you stuff salmon?

10:49.352 --> 10:51.387
I like stuffed salmon.

10:51.421 --> 10:53.455
After close scrutiny, Ja'nel...

10:53.490 --> 10:55.291
I think this one's great.
Mary...

10:55.325 --> 10:56.926
<i>The meat looks
like it's cooked well.</i>

10:56.960 --> 10:58.928
<i>And Cyndi...
It's a little more complex,</i>

10:58.962 --> 11:00.629
<i>which is nice.</i>

11:00.664 --> 11:01.931
Will represent the red team.

11:01.965 --> 11:03.165
Those are the three.

11:03.200 --> 11:04.400
<i>Beautiful.</i>

11:04.434 --> 11:05.835
As for the blue team,
Anthony...

11:05.869 --> 11:07.002
<i>
I think that looks great.</i>

11:07.037 --> 11:08.671
<i> It looks clean.</i>

11:08.705 --> 11:09.705
<i>And Zach...
High-class steak and potatoes.</i>

11:09.739 --> 11:11.006
And Jon's dishes...

11:11.041 --> 11:12.441
<i>Really well put together.
Thank you.</i>

11:12.475 --> 11:14.410
Will move on
to the tasting phase.

11:14.444 --> 11:16.612
But Michael's quail...
It doesn't look appetizing.

11:16.646 --> 11:18.113
And Ray's lobster...

11:18.148 --> 11:19.481
It's like something
out of a Sci-Fi movie, that.

11:19.516 --> 11:21.550
Have been eliminated
from the challenge.

11:21.585 --> 11:23.485
<i>
The plate's a little scary.</i>

11:23.520 --> 11:25.054
I think it's just too overdone.

11:25.088 --> 11:28.190
I'm sorry to scare you.

11:28.225 --> 11:30.392
Now that the
three representatives

11:30.427 --> 11:32.127
have been selected
for each team,

11:32.162 --> 11:34.864
it's time to see
how the dishes taste.

11:34.898 --> 11:37.066
We'll give each dish
a maximum of 100 points.

11:37.100 --> 11:39.902
<i>So I'll score the dish
out of 50,</i>

11:39.936 --> 11:42.705
<i>and Jennifer will score it
out of 50 as well.</i>

11:42.739 --> 11:44.840
<i>Okay, Jon.
Ready?</i>

11:44.875 --> 11:47.009
I'm ready.
Good.

11:47.043 --> 11:49.211
I have a confit leg

11:49.246 --> 11:50.713
<i>and a pan-seared duck breast.</i>

11:50.747 --> 11:51.814
<i>It tastes delicious.
Well done.</i>

11:51.848 --> 11:53.315
For me you've nailed
the seasoning.

11:53.350 --> 11:55.117
Jennifer, to give that
out of 50,

11:55.151 --> 11:56.385
<i>how would you mark that?</i>

11:56.419 --> 11:58.187
I'm definitely gonna give it
a 45.

11:58.221 --> 11:59.421
I'm gonna give it a 47.

11:59.456 --> 12:01.624
Thank you very much.
Really good job indeed.

12:01.658 --> 12:03.659
Jon's dish has earned 92 points,

12:03.693 --> 12:06.061
getting the blue team
off to a great start.

12:06.096 --> 12:07.663
<i>
Ja'nel, let's go, please.</i>

12:07.697 --> 12:09.098
Now it's up to Ja'nel

12:09.132 --> 12:10.466
to do the same
for the red team.

12:10.500 --> 12:11.901
<i>Basil-marinated
grilled prawns.</i>

12:11.935 --> 12:14.036
<i>I finished the dish with
a black garlic vinaigrette.</i>

12:14.070 --> 12:16.038
That's delicious.
Thank you.

12:16.072 --> 12:18.440
<i>
I'm gonna give this one...</i>

12:18.475 --> 12:20.042
44.

12:20.076 --> 12:21.277
I'm gonna go 45.

12:21.311 --> 12:22.845
Thanks, chef.
Very good indeed.

12:22.879 --> 12:24.280
<i>Good job.
Thank you.</i>

12:24.314 --> 12:27.449
89 is a "B." It's not an "A."
I want a perfect 100.

12:27.484 --> 12:30.552
Anthony, please, let's go.

12:30.587 --> 12:32.821
<i>It's a pan-seared halibut
that I crusted</i>

12:32.856 --> 12:35.691
<i>with coriander
and pink peppercorn.</i>

12:35.725 --> 12:37.126
I think it's good.
It's not great.

12:37.160 --> 12:38.928
Where would you score that?

12:38.962 --> 12:41.764
I'm gonna give this one a 40.

12:41.798 --> 12:43.365
I'm gonna go 42.

12:43.400 --> 12:45.501
Thank you.
I got an 82. Wow.

12:45.535 --> 12:47.670
This sucks.

12:47.704 --> 12:48.737
Cyndi, let's go.

12:48.772 --> 12:50.472
It's a fennel-crusted
sea bass.

12:50.507 --> 12:51.573
<i>And then I just made</i>

12:51.608 --> 12:53.042
<i>a honey sherry vinaigrette.</i>

12:53.076 --> 12:54.910
The taste was really surprising.
It was wonderful.

12:54.945 --> 12:56.812
Thank you very much.

12:56.846 --> 12:58.814
I would really give this one...

12:58.848 --> 13:00.015
A 45.

13:00.050 --> 13:01.650
I'm gonna say 45 as well.
Thank you.

13:01.685 --> 13:02.885
Whoo!

13:02.919 --> 13:04.920
We've got some pretty good
momentum going.

13:04.955 --> 13:07.389
Cyndi's 90-point contribution

13:07.424 --> 13:09.491
gives the women
a five-point lead

13:09.526 --> 13:10.859
heading into the final round.

13:10.894 --> 13:12.428
Zach, let's go.

13:12.462 --> 13:14.830
The blue team is behind,
got my finger crossed.

13:14.864 --> 13:16.732
<i>I want to be
in People Magazine.</i>

13:16.766 --> 13:19.568
<i>Roasted red pepper coulis
with some garlic and shallots.</i>

13:19.602 --> 13:21.603
<i>
It's got a good taste.</i>

13:21.638 --> 13:24.473
Just a little more medium-rare
would have been perfect,

13:24.507 --> 13:26.375
<i>but it does taste good.</i>

13:26.409 --> 13:28.344
So I'm gonna give it a 41.

13:28.378 --> 13:29.611
I'm gonna give it a 42.

13:29.646 --> 13:31.046
Thank you.

13:31.081 --> 13:32.514
Zach's 83 points takes

13:32.549 --> 13:34.783
the blue team's total to 257.

13:34.818 --> 13:35.918
Mary, please.

13:35.952 --> 13:37.052
Which means Mary will need

13:37.087 --> 13:38.754
at least 79 points to win it

13:38.788 --> 13:40.089
for her team.

13:40.123 --> 13:41.323
<i>It's a grilled flank steak.</i>

13:41.358 --> 13:43.025
It's just lightly dusted

13:43.059 --> 13:44.460
<i>with a little bit of wasabi
and lemongrass.</i>

13:44.494 --> 13:46.295
I think it just misses the mark

13:46.329 --> 13:50.432
with the way
that the meat is cooked.

13:51.634 --> 13:53.168
How would you judge that
out of 50?

13:53.203 --> 13:54.336
Come on, Mary!

13:54.371 --> 13:55.904
You can do it.
I know you can.

13:55.939 --> 14:00.409
I still thought
it tasted wonderful.

14:00.443 --> 14:02.578
I'm gonna give this one...

14:08.870 --> 14:10.137
In today's
presentation challenge,

14:10.171 --> 14:11.872
the men have the lead,

14:11.907 --> 14:14.341
but there is one chef
left to go on the red team.

14:14.376 --> 14:16.010
You've got the cheapest
ingredients there,

14:16.044 --> 14:17.111
but you've made them taste
a million dollars.

14:17.145 --> 14:18.712
If Mary can score

14:18.747 --> 14:20.581
at least 79 points,

14:20.615 --> 14:22.049
she will give the women

14:22.083 --> 14:24.618
their eighth victory
out of nine challenges.

14:24.653 --> 14:26.353
I think it just misses the mark

14:26.388 --> 14:29.290
with the way that the meat
is cooked.

14:29.324 --> 14:31.525
<i> How would you
judge that out of 50?</i>

14:31.559 --> 14:36.030
I still thought
it tasted wonderful.

14:36.064 --> 14:39.199
I'm gonna give
this one 45 for you.

14:39.234 --> 14:40.734
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

14:40.769 --> 14:41.769
I'm gonna go 45.

14:41.803 --> 14:43.070
Thank you, chef.
Great job.

14:43.104 --> 14:44.371
Thank you very much.

14:44.406 --> 14:46.373
The winning team
is the red team.

14:46.408 --> 14:47.641
<i>Well done.
Good job, Mary.</i>

14:47.676 --> 14:50.678
Oh, my God.
The ladies win again.

14:52.247 --> 14:55.249
Jon, you had
the highest-scoring dish.

14:55.283 --> 14:56.951
<i>Blue team, once again,</i>

14:56.985 --> 14:58.052
<i>you've lost.</i>

14:58.086 --> 14:59.853
So one person
from the red team,

14:59.888 --> 15:02.289
<i>you'll be in People Magazine.</i>

15:02.324 --> 15:04.024
We have a tie
because we have two dishes...

15:04.059 --> 15:06.627
<i>Mary's hanger steak</i>

15:06.661 --> 15:08.128
<i>or Cyndi's bass.</i>

15:08.163 --> 15:09.496
Which one gets featured?

15:09.531 --> 15:12.766
For me it was
about keeping it simple.

15:12.801 --> 15:15.169
And the taste was there.
And that's the steak.

15:15.203 --> 15:17.404
Mary, well done.

15:18.873 --> 15:21.041
Oh, my gosh.
I can't believe that I won.

15:21.076 --> 15:22.242
I mean, I can, but I can't.

15:22.277 --> 15:24.244
Pleasure.
Thanks, darling. Thank you.

15:24.279 --> 15:25.813
Mwah. Thank you.
Thank you.

15:25.847 --> 15:28.315
Thank you so much.

15:28.350 --> 15:31.051
Men, you've won one challenge

15:31.086 --> 15:32.586
out of nine.

15:32.620 --> 15:34.221
<i>Come on.
Ridiculous.</i>

15:34.255 --> 15:36.090
<i>You guys, I could have been
in People Magazine.</i>

15:36.124 --> 15:38.659
I had the highest-ranking
score of everyone.

15:38.693 --> 15:40.661
This is, like,
the third time I've had

15:40.695 --> 15:43.097
the best dish up there
in a row.

15:43.131 --> 15:44.665
And we still lost
the challenge, man.

15:44.699 --> 15:45.799
I'm so sick of being

15:45.834 --> 15:47.801
the only person
that gets it.

15:47.836 --> 15:49.403
Unfortunately,
today's punishment,

15:49.437 --> 15:52.673
<i>you'll be spending all day</i>

15:52.707 --> 15:53.907
cleaning the dorms.

15:53.942 --> 15:55.409
Oh, good.

15:55.443 --> 15:57.344
Not only for the blue team,

15:57.379 --> 15:59.780
but for the red team as well.

16:02.317 --> 16:03.417
<i>Ladies, in addition
to Mary's feature,</i>

16:03.451 --> 16:05.052
you'll all be photographed

16:05.086 --> 16:06.120
for "Star Watch."

16:10.525 --> 16:11.658
I also have an amazing surprise

16:11.693 --> 16:13.761
<i>up in the dorms.</i>

16:13.795 --> 16:16.563
Your limos are waiting.
Thank you, chef!

16:16.598 --> 16:17.664
Thank you, chef.

16:17.699 --> 16:19.666
I never thought
this would happen to me

16:19.701 --> 16:21.735
in my wildest dreams.

16:21.770 --> 16:23.103
Like, I could cry.

16:23.138 --> 16:24.638
Mary, you're gonna be
in a magazine.

16:32.080 --> 16:33.881
Vitamix, it's the.

16:33.915 --> 16:34.915
I've wanted one forever.

16:36.684 --> 16:38.719
"Please enjoy these top
of the line Vitamix blenders.

16:38.753 --> 16:41.255
You deserve only the best.
Chef Ramsay."

16:41.289 --> 16:42.823
Aww.

16:42.857 --> 16:46.360
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

16:47.562 --> 16:48.962
<i>Oh, man.</i>

16:48.997 --> 16:50.497
Oh, my goodness.

16:50.532 --> 16:52.066
This is awesome.

16:52.100 --> 16:53.634
While the women get ready

16:53.668 --> 16:55.369
for a day of glamour,

16:55.403 --> 16:58.705
the men begin another
brutal day of punishment.

16:58.740 --> 17:00.441
Of course, some, like,
q- tips on the floor.

17:00.475 --> 17:02.609
I'm not touching anything
without gloves.

17:02.644 --> 17:05.512
Oh, this is ignorant
and rude, you know that?

17:05.547 --> 17:07.748
Crumpled-up.

17:07.781 --> 17:09.049
Cookies in bed?

17:09.084 --> 17:10.250
Who eats in their bed?

17:10.285 --> 17:14.721
Who eats in their bed, period?

17:14.756 --> 17:18.092
Can I have a cookie?
Stuff it in my mouth.

17:19.260 --> 17:21.228
Snacking in your bed's
just nasty.

17:21.262 --> 17:23.030
While the blue team continues

17:23.064 --> 17:25.199
their crummy punishment,

17:25.233 --> 17:27.634
the red team arrives
for their photo shoot.

17:27.669 --> 17:29.803
Hi.
How are you?

17:29.838 --> 17:31.839
We have put together
an amazing team

17:31.873 --> 17:34.708
<i>to give you ladies
a celebrity makeover</i>

17:34.742 --> 17:36.977
<i>for your photo shoot.</i>

17:37.011 --> 17:38.879
I am so beside myself
with excitement.

17:38.913 --> 17:40.514
I'm just excited
to wear anything

17:40.548 --> 17:43.383
besides a chef coat
and chef pants.

17:43.418 --> 17:46.253
<i> Let's just pull
a few options for you.</i>

17:46.287 --> 17:47.354
<i>Okay.
And then we'll try some on</i>

17:47.388 --> 17:48.422
<i>back there.
Okay.</i>

17:48.456 --> 17:50.124
I already know that my team

17:50.158 --> 17:52.192
is gonna be stunned

17:52.227 --> 17:53.494
when they remake me.

17:53.528 --> 17:55.129
It's gonna be awesome.

17:55.163 --> 17:56.797
I don't ever wear makeup.
Wow, so this is special.

17:56.831 --> 17:58.799
Yeah.

17:58.833 --> 18:01.368
I'm just excited to see
what I'm gonna look like.

18:01.402 --> 18:02.703
How do you look?
It looks great.

18:02.737 --> 18:04.805
I can't even believe it.

18:04.839 --> 18:05.939
How cool are the shoes?

18:05.974 --> 18:07.908
I've never had
sparkly shoes before.

18:07.942 --> 18:08.942
Great.
I think you're ready.

18:08.977 --> 18:10.310
Okay.
Let's go.

18:13.515 --> 18:14.781
Hello.

18:14.816 --> 18:15.983
Hey, guys, the red team
might be getting

18:16.017 --> 18:18.619
a little thirsty,
so chef Ramsay

18:18.653 --> 18:20.387
wants Zach and Jon
to deliver some champagne.

18:20.421 --> 18:21.788
Yes, chef.

18:21.823 --> 18:24.091
Jon, you and Zach
gotta head downstairs

18:24.125 --> 18:26.226
and take champagne
to the girls.

18:26.261 --> 18:27.227
<i>
Oh, cool. Really?</i>

18:27.262 --> 18:28.729
Are you kidding me?

18:28.763 --> 18:30.797
Oh, I love it.
It gets more embarrassing.

18:30.832 --> 18:33.100
The cleaning, you know,

18:33.134 --> 18:34.201
that was up,

18:34.235 --> 18:37.304
but to take them champagne,

18:37.338 --> 18:40.040
I don't know
how much more humiliating

18:40.074 --> 18:42.276
it could be.

18:44.279 --> 18:45.779
Oh,.

18:45.813 --> 18:48.448
Hey, look, there's a map too.

18:48.483 --> 18:50.050
You know what, it, man.

18:50.084 --> 18:51.852
It's nice out.
Get a little wind in my hair.

18:51.886 --> 18:55.722
Let's do this.

18:55.757 --> 18:57.891
You gotta be
with me.

18:57.926 --> 19:00.861
At least I'm out of the dorms
right now.

19:00.895 --> 19:03.197
<i>Here with a little champagne
for you guys.</i>

19:03.231 --> 19:04.898
Thanks, guys.

19:04.933 --> 19:06.099
Hey, how are you?

19:06.134 --> 19:07.968
You know, I can't be salty
with the girls,

19:08.002 --> 19:08.969
'cause they did a good job,

19:09.003 --> 19:10.237
but at the same time

19:10.271 --> 19:11.738
it should be me
sitting right here.

19:11.773 --> 19:14.608
Thank you.

19:14.642 --> 19:16.043
Thank you, Zach.
Thank you.

19:16.077 --> 19:17.678
I could get used to this.
I hear that.

19:17.712 --> 19:19.846
Kudos, ladies,
'cause you guys need it.

19:19.881 --> 19:21.381
Get your right.

19:21.416 --> 19:22.616
Enjoy, ladies.
Bye, ladies.

19:22.650 --> 19:25.819
Have a good...
have a good time.

19:25.853 --> 19:27.321
Perfect.
One, two.

19:27.355 --> 19:29.690
<i>You look awesome.</i>

19:29.724 --> 19:31.124
One, two, three.

19:31.159 --> 19:33.160
OMG.

19:33.194 --> 19:36.063
Oh, my gosh.

19:36.097 --> 19:37.731
Guess who pops in?

19:37.765 --> 19:39.066
Chef Ramsay.

19:39.100 --> 19:40.534
I'm like, "Oh, my gosh.

19:40.568 --> 19:41.535
He's coming
to the photo shoot."

19:41.569 --> 19:42.569
Looks incredible.

19:42.604 --> 19:44.638
One, two, and three.
Ready?

19:44.672 --> 19:47.407
I'm like, bam, bam.

19:47.442 --> 19:49.076
Awesome.

19:49.110 --> 19:50.077
Excellent.
Well done, ladies.

19:50.111 --> 19:51.178
Amazing.
Thank you, chef.

19:51.212 --> 19:52.212
Those shots
are gonna be beautiful.

19:52.247 --> 19:53.213
Well done.

19:53.248 --> 19:54.748
See you back, yes?
Thank you.

19:54.782 --> 19:56.283
Thank you, chef.
Thank you.

19:58.786 --> 20:00.487
If they made lunch,
that would be awesome.

20:00.521 --> 20:01.722
<i>That would be pretty awesome.
I'm hungry.</i>

20:01.756 --> 20:03.090
Hi, guys.

20:03.124 --> 20:04.391
No lie.

20:04.425 --> 20:05.759
You all look really good.

20:05.793 --> 20:06.760
Thank you.

20:06.794 --> 20:08.395
Our reward was amazing.

20:08.429 --> 20:10.264
The hair stylists,
the makeup artists.

20:10.298 --> 20:11.665
We are so refreshed,

20:11.699 --> 20:13.233
and I am looking forward

20:13.268 --> 20:14.534
to some more relaxation.

20:19.807 --> 20:21.608
Hello.
It's chef here.

20:21.643 --> 20:23.543
Hi, chef.

20:23.578 --> 20:25.846
I need everybody
in my office immediately.

20:25.880 --> 20:28.582
Yes, chef.
Hurry up.

20:28.616 --> 20:29.916
Everybody get up right now.

20:29.951 --> 20:31.852
We have to go down
to chef's office double time.

20:31.886 --> 20:34.821
I can't go fast.
I'm sorry, it's the shoes.

20:34.856 --> 20:36.390
We're running
in our high heels.

20:36.424 --> 20:38.358
We're just kind of like...

20:38.393 --> 20:40.027
Completely stunned.

20:40.061 --> 20:41.828
We don't know what's going on.

20:41.863 --> 20:44.031
Let's go. Quick.

20:44.065 --> 20:45.465
<i>I've called you into my office
because there's something</i>

20:45.500 --> 20:47.901
very important
I would like to discuss

20:47.935 --> 20:50.570
with all of you.

20:55.888 --> 20:57.756
What started
as a relaxing evening...

20:58.858 --> 21:00.158
Has been interrupted

21:00.192 --> 21:02.160
by an urgent call
from chef Ramsay.

21:02.194 --> 21:05.930
There's something very important
I would like to discuss

21:05.965 --> 21:07.298
<i>with all of you.</i>

21:07.333 --> 21:09.701
<i>Hell's Kitchen is closed
to the public tonight.</i>

21:09.735 --> 21:12.470
But I will be opening the doors

21:12.505 --> 21:16.407
for two large tables of 12.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.209
They are distinguished members

21:18.244 --> 21:22.447
of the U.S. army
who are now home.

21:22.481 --> 21:23.715
I got a boatload of years
in the marine corps.

21:23.749 --> 21:24.849
This means a lot to me.

21:24.884 --> 21:27.185
We're honoring my comrades.

21:27.219 --> 21:29.154
Let's start getting prepped.
Let's go.

21:29.188 --> 21:31.222
Yes, chef.

21:31.257 --> 21:32.857
We got a five-second notice
that we was gonna be cooking

21:32.892 --> 21:33.858
for the military.

21:33.893 --> 21:35.660
Can someone unzip me?

21:35.694 --> 21:37.595
I am feeling nervous right now.

21:37.630 --> 21:38.696
I got the bee gees,
the bubble guts.

21:38.731 --> 21:41.900
This is insane.

21:41.934 --> 21:44.769
My makeup
is running down my face.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.304
Makeup is smearing,
like, everywhere,

21:46.338 --> 21:47.705
and it's just terrible.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.874
Everybody's face seems
to be melting off right now.

21:49.909 --> 21:51.676
While the women switch

21:51.710 --> 21:54.712
from a day of primping
to an evening of prepping,

21:54.747 --> 21:55.780
in the blue kitchen...

21:55.815 --> 21:57.215
Do you need help
with that, chef Zach?

21:57.249 --> 21:59.484
One chef has
the rest of his team

21:59.518 --> 22:01.352
a little concerned.

22:01.387 --> 22:03.822
Chef Zach, can I help you
scale those at all?

22:03.856 --> 22:06.658
Let's go, Zach.
Can't be dragging ass.

22:06.692 --> 22:08.459
He needs to snap
the hell out of it.

22:08.494 --> 22:10.028
What's that?

22:10.062 --> 22:11.963
I didn't say anything.

22:11.997 --> 22:14.165
The men and the women
who keep us safe here

22:14.200 --> 22:15.900
in America deserve to have
a pleasant time

22:15.935 --> 22:17.735
here at Hell's Kitchen,
but I'm still

22:17.770 --> 22:19.204
not on the blue team,
I'm still team me.

22:19.238 --> 22:20.471
<i>What do you need
after this, Zach?</i>

22:20.506 --> 22:21.739
<i>Just this?</i>

22:21.774 --> 22:23.975
Yeah.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.376
Let's go, Mary.

22:25.411 --> 22:26.544
<i> Yes, chef.</i>

22:26.579 --> 22:28.046
Gentlemen, line up.

22:28.080 --> 22:29.147
<i>Let's go.</i>

22:29.181 --> 22:31.416
<i>Tonight our guests</i>

22:31.450 --> 22:34.085
honorably serve our country.

22:34.119 --> 22:36.387
Tonight we serve them.

22:36.422 --> 22:37.722
Yes, chef.

22:37.756 --> 22:39.557
I'll assign one chef

22:39.592 --> 22:42.460
from each kitchen to be
responsible for each course.

22:42.494 --> 22:45.697
I need both kitchens
to be in sync.

22:45.731 --> 22:50.468
I'm gonna serve the food
at exactly the same time.

22:50.502 --> 22:52.503
And I think they deserve
the very best.

22:52.538 --> 22:53.538
<i> Yes, chef.
Absolutely.</i>

22:53.572 --> 22:55.740
Let's go.

23:02.014 --> 23:04.782
Soldiers are coming, guys.
Line up, please.

23:04.817 --> 23:06.017
<i> Tonight,
Hell's Kitchen is honoring</i>

23:06.051 --> 23:07.018
members of the military...

23:07.052 --> 23:08.620
Our first honoree,

23:08.654 --> 23:11.356
<i>Sergeant First Class
Lambeau Lambert.</i>

23:11.390 --> 23:13.157
Along with their families

23:13.192 --> 23:15.059
with a special six-course menu.

23:15.094 --> 23:19.397
Staff Sergeant Linda King.

23:19.431 --> 23:22.185
<i>Chief Warrant Officer
Caleb Long.</i>

23:23.206 --> 23:26.170
<i>Chief Warrant Officer
Rick Elliott.</i>

23:26.205 --> 23:28.973
The military definitely
has a place in my heart.

23:29.008 --> 23:30.208
My father served.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.410
My brother currently serves
as a marine.

23:32.444 --> 23:35.179
So tonight is really
about honoring him.

23:35.214 --> 23:36.881
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's an absolute honor.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.983
Please be seated.

23:39.018 --> 23:41.019
Each team is responsible

23:41.053 --> 23:42.220
for their table of 12.

23:42.254 --> 23:43.688
12 prawns
followed by 12 linguini,

23:43.722 --> 23:46.491
<i>12 risotto, 12 bass,
12 New York strip,</i>

23:46.525 --> 23:48.693
<i>and 12 souffle.
Yes, chef.</i>

23:48.727 --> 23:50.461
Each chef is
responsible for a course.

23:50.496 --> 23:51.863
Jon, give me a time.

23:51.897 --> 23:53.631
<i>81/2 minutes.
81/2. Let's go.</i>

23:53.666 --> 23:55.633
Red team, 81/2 for the window.

23:55.668 --> 23:56.768
Yes, chef.

23:56.802 --> 23:58.369
Ja'nel, drive it.
Let's go.

23:58.404 --> 24:00.305
Ja'nel and Jon are up first,

24:00.339 --> 24:02.941
and chef Ramsay expects them
to start the night off right

24:02.975 --> 24:04.142
by being in perfect sync

24:04.176 --> 24:05.543
on the first course...

24:05.577 --> 24:07.245
butter-poached spot prawns.

24:07.279 --> 24:09.147
Here's your prawns
right here, boo.

24:09.181 --> 24:11.983
Thank you.
This is your butter sauce.

24:12.017 --> 24:13.418
Let me know
when you guys are close,

24:13.452 --> 24:14.419
so I can drop these heads down.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.621
Five minutes to window, Ja'nel.

24:16.655 --> 24:18.489
Ja'nel, come on, please.

24:18.524 --> 24:20.058
<i>Ja'nel.
Yes, chef.</i>

24:20.092 --> 24:21.526
I need to hear you.
Yes, chef!

24:21.560 --> 24:23.394
It's your course.
Ladies, one minute till...

24:23.429 --> 24:24.762
look at me.
Wake up.

24:24.797 --> 24:26.464
Yes, chef.
You're not even directing anything.

24:26.498 --> 24:28.800
I've got about one more minute
on this shrimp.

24:28.834 --> 24:30.802
I'm frazzled,
but I'm not gonna give up.

24:30.836 --> 24:32.704
I'm not gonna quit.
41/2 minutes till the window, Ja'nel.

24:32.738 --> 24:33.738
Let's go.
41/2 heard, chef.

24:33.772 --> 24:34.806
41/2.

24:34.840 --> 24:36.207
You got my heads?

24:36.241 --> 24:37.976
Heads are good to go.

24:38.010 --> 24:39.777
Tonight I just want to be able
to prove to chef Ramsay

24:39.812 --> 24:42.046
that I can lead this service
and I can lead this team.

24:42.081 --> 24:43.614
How's these tea noodles looking?

24:43.649 --> 24:44.849
They're floating out, man.

24:44.883 --> 24:46.217
<i>Yeah, but... I know.
Don't worry.</i>

24:46.251 --> 24:47.885
We'll get 'em.
I'll find 'em.

24:47.920 --> 24:48.953
No, don't find 'em, dude.
I need 'em to not be floating

24:48.988 --> 24:50.555
out of the basket.

24:50.589 --> 24:53.257
But Ray's being his usual
bumbling self.

24:53.292 --> 24:54.325
Here, I'll hold 'em up.
I'll hold 'em up.

24:54.360 --> 24:55.660
Thank you.
Just grab 'em.

24:55.694 --> 24:57.362
Hold 'em
just like this, please.

24:57.396 --> 24:58.396
Ray, come on, man.

24:58.430 --> 25:00.064
It looks very nice, buddy.
Very nice.

25:00.099 --> 25:01.933
How long, please?
Come on, let's go.

25:01.967 --> 25:03.468
45 seconds to pass, chef.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.236
Blue team are plating, guys.
Let's go.

25:05.270 --> 25:06.938
Can we pull the pasta?
Can we pull the pasta?

25:06.972 --> 25:08.339
I'm pulling.
I'm pulling.

25:08.374 --> 25:09.774
Get a system going.
No, no, you.

25:09.808 --> 25:12.010
Look.
Where's your brain at times?

25:12.044 --> 25:13.211
Do you have the noodles?
She's got the...

25:13.245 --> 25:14.512
can you bring the noodles?

25:14.546 --> 25:16.214
Start on that end.
We'll start on this end.

25:16.248 --> 25:17.482
Don't touch anything yet

25:17.516 --> 25:19.083
<i>until I see them.
Stand back, please.</i>

25:19.118 --> 25:21.552
Let's go.

25:21.587 --> 25:22.954
Good. Jolly good job.
Let's go.

25:22.988 --> 25:25.556
Go, please.
Come on, Ja'nel.

25:25.591 --> 25:27.492
Come on, come on.
They're ready.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.894
Go, please.

25:29.928 --> 25:31.729
Gently hold the plates, please.

25:31.764 --> 25:34.799
Both kitchens
successfully deliver the prawns.

25:36.135 --> 25:38.836
And now it's up to Ray
and Nedra

25:38.871 --> 25:40.204
to get out the second course.

25:40.239 --> 25:42.306
<i>Red team, blue team, linguini</i>

25:42.341 --> 25:43.408
of lobster.

25:43.442 --> 25:44.976
Seven minutes, chef.

25:45.010 --> 25:46.644
Nedra, seven minutes
to the window.

25:46.678 --> 25:48.980
Yes, chef.

25:49.014 --> 25:51.349
I only got seven minutes
on the linguini.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.484
So I need more water
so it can cook quicker.

25:53.519 --> 25:56.120
Make sure that water
gets hot, hot.

25:56.155 --> 25:57.488
Right behind you.

25:57.523 --> 26:00.758
Nedra, seriously, did you
just pour cool water

26:00.793 --> 26:02.593
into a pot for pasta?

26:02.628 --> 26:04.262
<i>Get this pasta
working in the water.</i>

26:04.296 --> 26:06.631
It needs to be
at a rolling boil.

26:06.665 --> 26:09.300
This is definitely
the most rookie mistake

26:09.334 --> 26:10.902
that I've seen
my entire cooking career.

26:10.936 --> 26:12.403
<i>Just don't break 'em.</i>

26:12.438 --> 26:14.172
While the red
team watches Nedra's pot

26:14.206 --> 26:17.041
waiting for it to boil,
the blue team watches Ray.

26:17.076 --> 26:18.376
<i> Talk to us, Ray.</i>

26:18.410 --> 26:19.744
What you need?

26:19.778 --> 26:20.845
Waiting for some direction.

26:20.879 --> 26:22.413
Ray.
Watch your back. Yeah.

26:22.448 --> 26:23.481
<i>You got four guys
that can help you do stuff.</i>

26:23.515 --> 26:25.083
<i>All right.
Oh, my God. Ray!</i>

26:25.117 --> 26:26.084
<i>Yes, chef.
He's standing there,</i>

26:26.118 --> 26:27.585
<i>doing nothing.
Talk to him!</i>

26:27.619 --> 26:29.353
Ray needs to step it up,

26:29.388 --> 26:30.688
make sure everybody's on point.

26:30.722 --> 26:32.723
I want to see you
lead the course.

26:32.758 --> 26:34.125
Yes, chef.
Talk to them.

26:34.159 --> 26:37.028
Let me get there
for one second.

26:38.263 --> 26:39.430
51/2 to the window.

26:39.465 --> 26:40.932
Yes, chef.

26:40.966 --> 26:42.366
Is this pasta gonna be ready?

26:42.401 --> 26:43.768
Like, really, Susan?
Shut the up.

26:43.802 --> 26:45.036
I told you it's gonna be
five minutes.

26:45.070 --> 26:46.637
It's gonna be five minutes.

26:46.672 --> 26:47.638
Nedra, is it boiling?

26:47.673 --> 26:49.607
Come on.
It's your dish.

26:49.641 --> 26:53.044
Nedra, this is not
a hard concept.

26:53.078 --> 26:54.412
I got a lid.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.647
We are not at four minutes.
We're not.

26:56.682 --> 26:58.116
Is that water boiling yet?
Yes, chef.

26:58.150 --> 27:00.384
<i>Lift up the lid.</i>

27:00.419 --> 27:01.419
<i>No, chef.
It's not boiling.</i>

27:01.453 --> 27:03.454
It's at a simmer, chef.

27:03.489 --> 27:04.455
Ladies, the water's not boiling.

27:04.490 --> 27:06.724
<i>Right now I'm done.</i>

27:06.758 --> 27:09.360
Can someone get some foil
on there or something?

27:18.501 --> 27:22.070
It's 25 minutes into a
special military dinner service,

27:22.105 --> 27:23.905
and, while the first course
went out

27:23.940 --> 27:24.973
without any major glitches...

27:25.007 --> 27:26.475
You can't get this
anywhere else.

27:26.769 --> 27:29.111
Course number
two, the linguini...

27:29.145 --> 27:31.680
<i>has chef Ramsay
at his boiling point.</i>

27:31.714 --> 27:33.315
Is that water boiling yet?

27:33.349 --> 27:35.283
Unfortunately,
the same cannot be said

27:35.318 --> 27:36.651
for Nedra's pot of water.

27:36.686 --> 27:38.787
It's not boiling.

27:38.821 --> 27:41.423
Foil anybody?

27:41.457 --> 27:44.126
Chef Ramsay coming to show us
how to boil pasta

27:44.160 --> 27:45.460
is pretty pathetic.

27:45.495 --> 27:46.962
That will be boiling guaranteed

27:46.996 --> 27:48.492
in less than 30 seconds.
Thank you, chef.

27:48.604 --> 27:50.599
How hard is it
to up linguini?

27:50.633 --> 27:52.534
Evidently I it up.

27:52.568 --> 27:54.636
They're plating. How long?
A minute.

27:54.670 --> 27:57.272
While Nedra struggles
to catch up on the second course...

27:57.306 --> 27:58.807
Do not wait for Nedra.

27:58.841 --> 27:59.908
In the blue kitchen,

27:59.942 --> 28:01.943
Ray decides to get
a head start on plating.

28:01.978 --> 28:04.279
But for some reason
he's doing it solo.

28:04.313 --> 28:06.415
Look, he's got four other people
to help him.

28:06.449 --> 28:08.183
Ray's on a different planet.

28:08.217 --> 28:09.751
He's just got blinders on.

28:09.786 --> 28:11.553
Why is Ray serving?

28:11.587 --> 28:13.588
Anthony's behind you,
doing nothing.

28:13.623 --> 28:14.956
Ray, you're in charge.
You gotta lead...

28:14.991 --> 28:16.958
I know that, chef.
Shh, you need to lead them.

28:16.993 --> 28:18.293
What are they doing?

28:18.327 --> 28:19.895
They're waiting
for your direction.

28:19.929 --> 28:21.229
Gonna makemake sure
all the lobster's enough

28:21.264 --> 28:23.331
for each dish, okay, Zach?
Like this.

28:23.366 --> 28:24.866
Don't worry, grandpa.

28:24.901 --> 28:27.402
It's not all gonna turn
to, I promise you.

28:27.437 --> 28:28.770
Hey, Zach.
Look at that and look at that.

28:28.805 --> 28:29.838
There's no lobster
in there, Zach.

28:29.872 --> 28:31.139
But you shouldn't be
leaving this then.

28:31.174 --> 28:33.942
Tell him! Zach, make this
one look just like that.

28:33.976 --> 28:36.144
Zach, I showed you what to do.

28:36.179 --> 28:38.313
Does that mean I have to
stand over you constantly?

28:38.347 --> 28:40.916
Hey, blue team,
half a portion on there.

28:40.950 --> 28:42.217
Look.
Full portion on there.

28:42.251 --> 28:45.187
Look at me.
Half a portion, full portion.

28:45.221 --> 28:46.254
Zach, do me a favor.

28:46.289 --> 28:47.789
off.

28:47.824 --> 28:49.291
Take it over.
You're killing me.

28:49.325 --> 28:50.692
You're killing me.
Try to throw me under the bus.

28:50.726 --> 28:52.828
You're killing me over here.
Eat and die.

28:52.862 --> 28:54.763
You're making me look
like a.

28:54.797 --> 28:55.897
<i>This course is taking
a long time</i>

28:55.932 --> 28:57.732
for something so simple.

28:57.767 --> 28:59.835
The combination
of Ray's lack of leadership

28:59.869 --> 29:01.303
and Zach's poor portioning

29:01.337 --> 29:02.437
are slowing down the blue team.

29:02.472 --> 29:04.873
Dude, watch the portion
on that, man.

29:04.907 --> 29:06.842
Giving Nedra a chance
to get her linguini cooked...

29:06.876 --> 29:08.543
Come on, Nedra.
Plated...

29:08.578 --> 29:10.212
<i> Go, please.</i>

29:10.246 --> 29:11.847
And delivered to the dining room

29:11.881 --> 29:13.114
ahead
of the men's second course.

29:13.149 --> 29:14.382
Ray!
We're going, chef.

29:14.417 --> 29:15.417
Ray, buddy, come on, man.

29:15.451 --> 29:17.919
A lunch lady
could do this right now.

29:17.954 --> 29:21.056
No offense to you lunch ladies.
You're awesome.

29:21.090 --> 29:22.524
Go.

29:22.558 --> 29:23.859
You can only go so fast
sometimes.

29:23.893 --> 29:25.193
I mean, holy crap.

29:25.228 --> 29:26.761
Wow, do you smell that?

29:26.796 --> 29:29.030
<i>It smells amazing.
I like the flavor.</i>

29:29.065 --> 29:30.398
That was embarrassing.

29:30.433 --> 29:33.235
Is it hard, sir?

29:33.269 --> 29:34.936
<i>Shall I make a new one
for you, sir?</i>

29:34.971 --> 29:38.707
Chef, one of the officers
is sending it back.

29:38.741 --> 29:41.142
He said it's hard.

29:41.177 --> 29:44.913
One linguini on the fly.
undercooked.

29:44.947 --> 29:46.915
Oh, me.
Really?

29:46.949 --> 29:49.251
Mary, Michael, risotto.

29:49.285 --> 29:51.386
How long? How long?
Eight minutes to the window.

29:51.420 --> 29:52.621
I can do it in eight.
All right.

29:52.655 --> 29:53.622
Let's go.
Eight minutes to window.

29:53.656 --> 29:54.623
Eight.
Granddad.

29:54.657 --> 29:55.690
Move with that linguini.

29:55.725 --> 29:58.593
Get the rice on.
Get the stock in the pot.

29:58.628 --> 29:59.861
And we're using
the mushroom stock for this.

29:59.896 --> 30:01.363
Mushroom stock.
I hope so, Susan.

30:01.397 --> 30:03.398
That's why it's called
a mushroom risotto.

30:03.432 --> 30:05.200
Please, I know you're blonde,
but you're not stupid, right?

30:05.234 --> 30:07.969
First of all, this is fake.

30:08.004 --> 30:09.471
<i>The mushroom risotto,
you're asking her...</i>

30:09.505 --> 30:10.839
No, no, no,
no, I'm reminding...

30:10.873 --> 30:11.940
I was just reminding her, chef.

30:11.974 --> 30:13.441
You're blond too, chef Ramsay,

30:13.476 --> 30:16.144
so what does that say
about you?

30:16.178 --> 30:17.712
With Mary in complete charge

30:17.747 --> 30:18.713
of the red kitchen...

30:18.748 --> 30:20.315
I want everybody
to taste as well.

30:20.349 --> 30:21.950
And Michael doing the same

30:21.984 --> 30:23.351
for the blue team...
Stay in control, Michael.

30:23.386 --> 30:24.486
<i>Oui, chef.</i>

30:24.520 --> 30:26.388
Both teams are well-coordinated.

30:26.422 --> 30:28.189
Two minutes.
Minute and a half I'm going.

30:28.224 --> 30:30.125
And they deliver
their risotto course

30:30.159 --> 30:32.661
in perfect unison
to both VIP tables.

30:32.695 --> 30:34.296
<i> This is delicious.</i>

30:34.330 --> 30:36.431
<i>
He'd eat a whole bowl of this.</i>

30:36.465 --> 30:38.533
But one dish
is still lagging behind.

30:38.568 --> 30:39.668
Ray, where's the lobster?

30:39.702 --> 30:41.469
Chef, it's...

30:41.504 --> 30:43.004
<i>This is embarrassing, though.
Chef, do me a favor.</i>

30:43.039 --> 30:44.573
Toss that in the butter
for the lobster tail

30:44.607 --> 30:46.341
real fast for me, please.

30:46.375 --> 30:48.443
So earlier chef Ray tells me

30:48.477 --> 30:49.778
to off.

30:49.812 --> 30:51.479
And now I'm definitely going
to get revenge.

30:51.514 --> 30:52.747
I'm trying to sabotage him.

30:52.782 --> 30:54.716
You got Ray's lobster tail
right there.

30:54.750 --> 30:55.984
I'm thinking

30:56.018 --> 30:57.118
I can it up
with cold sauce.

30:57.153 --> 30:59.087
Here you are, chef Ray.

30:59.121 --> 31:00.655
I'm the last person
you want to cross.

31:00.690 --> 31:02.557
This is the lesson learned
the hard way.

31:02.592 --> 31:05.093
Hey.
Come here.

31:05.127 --> 31:07.362
Just touch that.

31:07.396 --> 31:09.764
Hey, no, no,
'cause you brought it.

31:09.799 --> 31:12.300
It's cold.
Ray, it's cold.

31:12.335 --> 31:13.835
One minute before your
linguini's ready.

31:15.605 --> 31:17.272
When are you two gonna wake up?
Yes, chef.

31:17.306 --> 31:20.675
Ha, I'm just laughing
thinking to myself, "I got you."

31:20.710 --> 31:22.944
You stand by and watch him
up this appetizer?

31:22.979 --> 31:24.679
I'm so pissed at Zach.

31:24.714 --> 31:26.548
I'm like, "Dude, you just...
you me."

31:26.582 --> 31:28.683
What's he got against you?
What is it?

31:28.718 --> 31:30.085
I don't know, chef.
Chef, I don't have nothing against him.

31:31.721 --> 31:35.390
As Ray starts over once again
on his lobster linguini,

31:35.424 --> 31:36.891
Anthony and Cyndi

31:36.926 --> 31:38.660
take control
of the loup de mer course.

31:38.694 --> 31:39.794
We're going in seven.

31:39.829 --> 31:41.262
In two I want fish
and succotash down.

31:41.297 --> 31:43.009
A little bit more butter.
A little bit more stock

31:43.051 --> 31:44.232
<i>just to keep glazing them over.</i>

31:44.276 --> 31:45.165
Service, please.

31:45.363 --> 31:48.103
And each deliver
perfect loup de mer to the diners.

31:48.137 --> 31:50.572
That is very, very good.

31:50.606 --> 31:52.707
Meanwhile, Ray finally finishes

31:52.742 --> 31:54.275
his last order
of lobster linguini.

31:54.310 --> 31:56.511
Thank you.

31:56.545 --> 31:58.013
Hey, the linguini
finally went out.

31:58.047 --> 32:00.315
Cool.
Only two courses late.

32:00.349 --> 32:01.716
<i> Well?
A little better.</i>

32:01.751 --> 32:03.118
<i>Oh, my. A little bit?
</i>

32:03.152 --> 32:04.753
Susan, let's go.
Yes, chef.

32:04.787 --> 32:06.655
Zach, they're clearing
in two minutes.

32:06.689 --> 32:09.090
New York steak is the
final entree of the evening.

32:09.125 --> 32:10.992
How long?
Eight minutes.

32:11.027 --> 32:12.560
Eight minutes sounds good.
Drive your team, Zach.

32:12.595 --> 32:14.029
And it's up to Zach...

32:14.063 --> 32:15.030
Come on, guys.

32:15.064 --> 32:16.031
And Susan...

32:16.065 --> 32:17.599
Nedra, please. Turnips.

32:17.633 --> 32:19.434
To get their beef cooked

32:19.468 --> 32:22.070
to the right temperature
at exactly the same time.

32:22.104 --> 32:23.772
51/2 out.

32:23.806 --> 32:25.140
Right now I'm a little scared.

32:25.174 --> 32:26.908
We've been having trouble
with steaks lately,

32:26.942 --> 32:29.144
so I hope I can prove

32:29.178 --> 32:30.445
that steaks can be done right
out of this kitchen.

32:30.479 --> 32:32.914
No, they're raw.

32:32.948 --> 32:34.683
Let him know
how much more you need now.

32:34.717 --> 32:36.051
It sucks to have to ask
for more time,

32:36.085 --> 32:37.986
but, you know what,
you have to be humble.

32:38.020 --> 32:39.888
I need more time on my steaks.

32:39.922 --> 32:40.820
How much?

32:40.898 --> 32:43.243
From here to plating,
I'm gonna need seven minutes.

32:43.278 --> 32:44.459
All right, seven minutes.
Come on, Susan.

32:44.493 --> 32:46.327
Come on, Susan.

32:46.362 --> 32:48.563
Gosh, we still need time.
Yeah, you need a lot more time, hon.

32:48.597 --> 32:49.831
<i>
Would you say five minutes?</i>

32:49.865 --> 32:51.833
I would say, yeah.

32:51.867 --> 32:53.234
I feel like I'm
right now,

32:53.269 --> 32:54.969
because I'm holding
the blue team back.

32:55.004 --> 32:56.571
No, our steaks
are not ready to go.

32:56.605 --> 32:57.906
How long do you need?
We need five minutes.

32:57.940 --> 32:59.641
Five minutes? We're ready
in a minute and a half.

32:59.675 --> 33:02.010
I mean, I can't make
the oven go any faster.

33:02.044 --> 33:05.313
Susan, their steaks have
to overcook so you stay on time?

33:05.347 --> 33:07.482
No, you asked for more time.

33:07.516 --> 33:09.284
He granted you.

33:09.318 --> 33:10.652
You can't go back now,
two minutes to go,

33:10.686 --> 33:11.653
say, "I need five."

33:11.687 --> 33:12.954
Bitch, you better get it
together.

33:12.988 --> 33:14.456
You better cook
these steaks right.

33:14.490 --> 33:16.458
Coming out.
They're slicing.

33:16.492 --> 33:18.860
Did you check it?
The steaks have to be right on.

33:18.894 --> 33:21.196
But I'm on the edge of my seat

33:21.230 --> 33:22.230
that they're not gonna be ready.

33:22.264 --> 33:23.798
<i> Are they ready?</i>

33:23.833 --> 33:25.467
<i>Did you check one,
or you just guessed?</i>

33:32.861 --> 33:34.028
It's near the end

33:34.063 --> 33:36.064
of a special private dinner
service

33:36.098 --> 33:39.067
honoring distinguished members
of the military.

33:39.101 --> 33:41.669
And the success
of the final course

33:41.704 --> 33:43.371
is in the hands of Zach
in the blue kitchen...

33:43.405 --> 33:45.239
Come on, guys.

33:45.274 --> 33:46.674
And Susan in the red kitchen.

33:46.709 --> 33:47.842
<i> Are they ready?
Did you check one,</i>

33:47.876 --> 33:49.177
<i>or you just guessed?</i>

33:49.211 --> 33:51.179
It sucks to be yelled at
by chef Ramsay.

33:51.213 --> 33:52.313
Perfect.
Start the salad.

33:52.348 --> 33:54.415
The steaks are cooked perfectly.

33:54.450 --> 33:55.583
Bring it on, chef.

33:55.617 --> 33:57.685
<i>Susan, the steaks are ready,</i>

33:57.720 --> 33:59.320
and there's not one thing
on the plate.

33:59.355 --> 34:00.989
<i>Why aren't they starting
to dress?</i>

34:01.023 --> 34:02.390
<i>You're a disgrace.</i>

34:02.424 --> 34:04.759
Bring the turnips up and get
them on the plate please.

34:04.793 --> 34:05.793
Hurry up, Susan.

34:05.828 --> 34:07.462
Yes, chef.

34:07.496 --> 34:10.697
<i> Zach, where's
the sauce at, bro?</i>

34:10.733 --> 34:12.199
<i>Zach, where's your sauce at?</i>

34:12.234 --> 34:15.268
Why can't he talk?

34:15.304 --> 34:17.170
He's not answering me now.
He's completely switched off.

34:17.206 --> 34:18.672
<i>You get no direction
from your leader.</i>

34:18.706 --> 34:20.908
Zach, speak up
and drive your ticket

34:20.943 --> 34:22.643
and let us know exactly
what's going on.

34:22.678 --> 34:24.178
Blue team, what are they doing

34:24.213 --> 34:25.746
<i>to their meat
that you haven't done?</i>

34:25.781 --> 34:26.914
<i> Season.</i>

34:26.949 --> 34:29.350
Season.
We seasoned our meat, chef.

34:29.385 --> 34:30.618
No, you lying.

34:30.652 --> 34:32.652
You did not slice it
and season it.

34:32.688 --> 34:34.355
When chef Ramsay's pissed,

34:34.389 --> 34:35.757
got these beady little eyes.

34:35.791 --> 34:37.391
They're seasoning theirs

34:37.426 --> 34:39.427
once it's sliced open.
Don't lie.

34:39.460 --> 34:40.527
"Don't you lie to me."

34:40.562 --> 34:42.130
Season it!

34:42.164 --> 34:43.464
You don't got to have
a hissy fit.

34:43.498 --> 34:44.665
Go, please.

34:44.699 --> 34:45.867
Oh, my God.

34:45.900 --> 34:48.369
<i> That was pathetic.</i>

34:48.404 --> 34:50.237
Despite less than
inspirational leadership

34:50.272 --> 34:51.739
on the final course,

34:51.774 --> 34:54.809
the VIPs are finally served
their steak.

34:54.842 --> 34:56.411
<i> Good?
Fabulous.</i>

34:56.445 --> 34:58.279
It's really, really good.

34:58.313 --> 34:59.547
Stoves off.
Clear down.

34:59.581 --> 35:01.816
I think I did a good job
tonight.

35:01.850 --> 35:03.985
I can't be concerned
with the criticism.

35:04.019 --> 35:06.020
Everything was a little bit
of a stumble,

35:06.055 --> 35:07.588
but we made it.

35:10.426 --> 35:12.693
Listen, carefully.

35:12.728 --> 35:15.496
It's ironic on the night
that we're honoring

35:15.531 --> 35:17.732
the military, I had to battle

35:17.766 --> 35:19.667
<i>in both kitchens.</i>

35:19.701 --> 35:20.868
<i>I thought tonight
you were gonna shine</i>

35:20.903 --> 35:22.470
<i>and do your country proud.</i>

35:22.504 --> 35:24.906
I think you did them
an injustice.

35:26.341 --> 35:29.043
<i>The losing team tonight...</i>

35:29.078 --> 35:32.046
Is the blue...

35:32.081 --> 35:34.715
And the red.

35:35.884 --> 35:38.186
I'd like both teams to nominate

35:38.220 --> 35:41.289
<i>the one person that you think</i>

35:41.323 --> 35:42.690
<i>is the weakest in your team.</i>

35:42.724 --> 35:44.125
Piss off.

35:44.159 --> 35:46.761
Yes, chef.

35:46.795 --> 35:49.797
This service should have been
a walk in the park.

35:49.832 --> 35:51.299
But we messed up again.

35:51.333 --> 35:54.001
Now picking one person,

35:54.036 --> 35:55.603
it's always hard.

35:55.637 --> 35:57.905
Me, Anthony,
and Michael ran it tonight.

35:57.940 --> 36:00.741
So that leaves you and Ray.

36:00.776 --> 36:02.777
Prove to me why I shouldn't
put you up for nomination.

36:02.811 --> 36:04.946
I did a better job
than Zach did.

36:04.980 --> 36:07.448
<i>I've led more guys
doing more services, okay?</i>

36:07.483 --> 36:08.850
<i>I'm telling you I bring it.</i>

36:08.884 --> 36:10.184
And I can lead a team.
I do it all the time.

36:10.219 --> 36:11.552
Okay?
I'm a leader.

36:11.587 --> 36:12.787
I spent 16 years
in the marine corps.

36:12.821 --> 36:14.388
I don't deserve to be up
for nomination.

36:14.423 --> 36:16.591
Been up there twice,
and I'm not going up again.

36:16.625 --> 36:19.093
If I do get nominated,
I'll truly know why.

36:19.128 --> 36:23.264
Not because I'm a bad chef,
but because I'm a good chef.

36:23.298 --> 36:25.099
Look, you don't want me here,
then put me up.

36:25.134 --> 36:27.001
<i> It's not about not
wanting you here, man.</i>

36:27.035 --> 36:28.870
This is about what happened
tonight, dude.

36:28.904 --> 36:30.738
All right, so next time
when you guys gotta lead

36:30.772 --> 36:32.039
<i>the brigade flawless, though,</i>

36:32.074 --> 36:33.908
chef Ray will do everything
better than I would?

36:33.942 --> 36:36.577
I don't know at this point.

36:36.612 --> 36:38.446
I'm sick of this.

36:38.480 --> 36:39.947
Zach needs to get
the out.

36:39.982 --> 36:43.251
Honestly, why wouldn't you
want me to go?

36:43.285 --> 36:45.386
Pick. Stop being cowards
and pick.

36:46.722 --> 36:48.523
Is it the three of us?
Is it the four of us?

36:48.557 --> 36:51.392
I would say Susan and Nedra.
Yeah.

36:51.426 --> 36:53.027
I'm not going up
for elimination tonight.

36:53.061 --> 36:55.196
<i>We all have flaws,
you know what I'm saying?</i>

36:55.230 --> 36:56.864
Yes, we all had mistakes,

36:56.899 --> 36:58.733
but the pasta water
was such an amateur move.

36:58.767 --> 37:01.102
Like, you put in cold water.

37:01.136 --> 37:02.436
<i> She is the weakest
person on our team right now.</i>

37:02.471 --> 37:04.372
I'm not the weakest person.

37:04.406 --> 37:07.608
The weakest link is Susan.

37:07.643 --> 37:09.110
Susan, when you told them
seven minutes,

37:09.144 --> 37:10.478
you knew you needed longer,

37:10.512 --> 37:11.612
and you should have
just stepped up and said,

37:11.647 --> 37:12.747
<i>"I'm not gonna be ready."</i>

37:12.781 --> 37:14.115
That's what held us back
on that station.

37:14.149 --> 37:16.083
I just want to say

37:16.118 --> 37:18.386
I really thought that I was
really, really contributing.

37:18.420 --> 37:20.054
<i>I really feel</i>

37:20.088 --> 37:23.324
like I am a huge contribution
to the team.

37:23.358 --> 37:26.294
So I just...
I really do.

37:26.328 --> 37:28.429
I mean, maybe...
I don't know if you guys agree,

37:28.463 --> 37:31.599
but, I mean, I really feel
like I...

37:35.337 --> 37:37.505
Are you kidding me?

37:37.539 --> 37:40.041
They're just like...

37:40.075 --> 37:41.542
I am not going home,

37:41.577 --> 37:44.045
because I don't care
who I have to take down

37:44.079 --> 37:45.680
or who I have to fight,
I'm gonna fight.

37:45.714 --> 37:48.783
We all have to fight
for ourselves.

37:48.817 --> 37:52.153
<i> Guys, who we doing?</i>

38:02.798 --> 38:04.665
Mary.
Yes, chef.

38:04.700 --> 38:06.934
Your one nominee
from the red team.

38:06.969 --> 38:07.969
<i>Who is it and why, please?</i>

38:08.003 --> 38:09.637
We were trying to decide

38:09.671 --> 38:12.106
between the meat
and the linguini tonight.

38:12.140 --> 38:13.608
So it's between Nedra
and Susan?

38:13.642 --> 38:16.844
<i>Yes, chef.
So who is it?</i>

38:16.878 --> 38:18.679
Um...

38:18.714 --> 38:22.516
The weakest member
of your team is?

38:22.551 --> 38:24.552
We nominate...

38:29.448 --> 38:31.616
With no dinner service winner,

38:31.650 --> 38:34.452
both teams were instructed
to nominate one person

38:34.486 --> 38:35.820
for elimination.

38:35.854 --> 38:39.624
The weakest member
of your team is?

38:39.658 --> 38:43.261
We nominated Nedra tonight,
chef.

38:43.295 --> 38:45.029
Susan, are you a better chef
than Nedra?

38:45.064 --> 38:46.364
I believe that I have
the finesse,

38:46.398 --> 38:47.465
I have the passion.

38:47.499 --> 38:51.636
She kind of lacks that oomph.

38:51.670 --> 38:54.405
Jon.
Yes, chef.

38:54.440 --> 38:56.240
<i>Blue team's decision.
Who is it and why?</i>

38:56.275 --> 38:58.309
Blue team's decision was Ray.

38:58.344 --> 38:59.844
<i>And to be real honest</i>

38:59.878 --> 39:02.080
<i>it was really close
between Ray and Zach tonight.</i>

39:02.114 --> 39:05.416
<i>They both let us down
in the kitchen during service.</i>

39:05.451 --> 39:06.751
<i>Ray.
Chef.</i>

39:06.785 --> 39:07.752
Are you better than Zach?

39:07.786 --> 39:09.387
I am, chef.

39:09.421 --> 39:11.723
Tonight I had to kick Zach
off the line,

39:11.757 --> 39:13.091
'cause he screwed up my pasta.

39:13.125 --> 39:14.826
He couldn't even get
the portions the same size.

39:14.860 --> 39:18.029
When I asked him to poach
the other lobster tail,

39:18.063 --> 39:20.832
Zach made a mistake on purpose.

39:20.866 --> 39:22.367
Oh, God.

39:22.401 --> 39:24.402
The cold one
that came up to the pass?

39:24.436 --> 39:27.171
Yup.

39:27.206 --> 39:28.940
<i>Okay.</i>

39:28.974 --> 39:32.176
Nedra, Ray,

39:32.211 --> 39:36.247
Zach, step forward.

39:36.281 --> 39:38.316
Oh,.

39:38.350 --> 39:41.219
Nedra, why do you think you
should stay in Hell's Kitchen?

39:41.253 --> 39:43.955
Chef, I came a long way
to get here,

39:43.989 --> 39:45.690
<i>and I'm not giving up.</i>

39:45.724 --> 39:47.658
Yes, I did pull a rookie move
and had too much water

39:47.693 --> 39:49.594
for the pasta,
but it's not how you start,

39:49.628 --> 39:52.296
it's how you finish,
and I finished strong.

39:52.331 --> 39:54.298
Zach, how would you rate
your performance tonight?

39:54.333 --> 39:56.334
I would rate my performance
a seven, chef.

39:56.368 --> 39:59.537
<i>Oh, come on.
Seriously?</i>

40:02.441 --> 40:04.375
Ray, why do you think you
should stay in Hell's Kitchen?

40:04.410 --> 40:05.743
Chef,
I'm just getting stronger,

40:05.778 --> 40:06.811
and I'm getting better.

40:06.845 --> 40:07.945
And I'm getting
more comfortable

40:07.980 --> 40:09.147
doing what I do here.

40:09.181 --> 40:10.915
What have you got
that Zach hasn't got?

40:10.949 --> 40:12.750
I've got more drive,
more passion,

40:12.785 --> 40:15.620
and I've got more honor,
and I've got more integrity.

40:15.654 --> 40:17.755
<i>Okay.</i>

40:17.790 --> 40:20.758
My decision is...

40:25.497 --> 40:27.065
Nedra,

40:27.099 --> 40:31.069
give me the service
of your life next time.

40:31.103 --> 40:32.737
<i>Otherwise, you are history.</i>

40:32.771 --> 40:34.705
Back in line.

40:35.974 --> 40:37.608
<i>.
Now this is tough for me.</i>

40:37.643 --> 40:40.111
I can send Ray home.

40:40.145 --> 40:41.946
Ray, half a portion on there.

40:41.980 --> 40:43.247
Look.
Full portion on there.

40:43.282 --> 40:44.615
Look at me!

40:44.650 --> 40:46.117
Half a portion.
Full portion.

40:46.151 --> 40:49.821
I can send Zach home.

40:49.855 --> 40:51.422
Just touch that.

40:51.457 --> 40:54.058
No, no, yeah, you,
'cause you brought it.

40:54.093 --> 40:56.794
It's cold.

40:56.829 --> 41:00.198
Or I can send you both home.

41:03.202 --> 41:05.036
My decision is...

41:08.427 --> 41:10.675
Ray, please give me
your jacket.

41:10.709 --> 41:12.643
Yes, chef.

41:12.678 --> 41:14.112
I respect you.

41:14.146 --> 41:16.814
Thanks, chef.

41:18.283 --> 41:21.919
Bye, Ray.
Take it easy, Ray.

41:21.954 --> 41:23.488
Tonight is a disappointment,

41:23.522 --> 41:25.022
and it eats me up.

41:25.057 --> 41:26.290
I'm leaving with my integrity.

41:26.325 --> 41:28.059
I'm leaving with my pride.

41:28.093 --> 41:29.861
And I'm leaving knowing
that I was a gentleman.

41:29.895 --> 41:31.696
I may have been
the oldest competitor ever

41:31.730 --> 41:34.065
<i>to be on Hell's Kitchen,
but, I'll tell you,</i>

41:34.099 --> 41:35.399
I think I gave it
a hell of a run.

41:35.434 --> 41:37.735
What I have in store for you

41:37.769 --> 41:40.037
will tell me more
about all of you

41:40.072 --> 41:43.207
<i>than any other service
we've ever had before.</i>

41:43.242 --> 41:44.575
Yes, chef.

41:44.610 --> 41:47.145
Get out.

41:47.179 --> 41:49.814
I'm really sad to see Ray go,

41:49.848 --> 41:51.782
but, now that he's gone,
it's definitely

41:51.817 --> 41:54.385
a step in the right direction
for the blue team.

41:54.419 --> 41:56.053
Can I have a cigarette, please?

41:56.088 --> 41:58.189
We're gonna be okay.
We okay?

41:58.223 --> 41:59.223
Really, Susan?

41:59.258 --> 42:00.825
Like, I'm pissed off.

42:00.859 --> 42:02.693
Y'all just took
the easy way out in voting me.

42:02.728 --> 42:04.162
that.

42:04.196 --> 42:06.130
Ray's age wasn't the issue.

42:06.165 --> 42:07.298
It was his cooking.

42:07.332 --> 42:09.000
And I wasn't getting
any younger

42:09.034 --> 42:10.736
waiting for him to improve.
