WEBVTT

00:10.511 --> 00:12.380
* Hustle, bustle

00:12.413 --> 00:14.615
* And so much muscle

00:14.648 --> 00:16.750
* Cells about to separate
and I *

00:16.784 --> 00:18.686
* Find it hard to concentrate
and *

00:18.719 --> 00:23.791
* Temporary this,
cash and carry *

00:23.824 --> 00:25.393
* I'm steppin' up to indicate

00:25.426 --> 00:27.828
* The time has come to deviate
and *

00:27.861 --> 00:32.366
* All I want
is for you to be happy and *

00:32.400 --> 00:36.737
* Take this moment
to make you my family and *

00:36.770 --> 00:41.375
* Finally you have found
something perfect and *

00:41.409 --> 00:45.446
* Finally you have found...

00:47.515 --> 00:48.716
Morning.

00:48.749 --> 00:52.520
* Death defying,
this mess I'm buying *

00:52.553 --> 00:54.622
* It's raining down
with love and hate *

00:54.655 --> 00:57.191
* And I find it hard to motivate
and *

00:57.225 --> 01:02.196
* Estuary is blessed but scary,
your *

01:02.230 --> 01:03.631
* Heart's about to palpitate

01:03.664 --> 01:05.333
* And I'm not about
to hesitate... *

01:05.366 --> 01:06.834
Thank you.

01:06.867 --> 01:10.838
* One to treasure the rest
of your days here and *

01:10.871 --> 01:15.109
* Give you pleasure
in so many ways, dear, and... *

01:15.143 --> 01:17.178
(glass shattering)

01:19.147 --> 01:21.649
(people screaming,
glass tinkling)

01:27.555 --> 01:29.523
Oh, hey.
Hi.

01:29.557 --> 01:30.858
Sorry we're late.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.860
We had to review
the research budget.

01:32.893 --> 01:34.895
We didn't have to, considering
I was right the first time.

01:34.928 --> 01:37.865
Well, thoroughness clearly
is a genetic trait.

01:37.898 --> 01:39.667
You color-tab like
an academic, Alan.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.502
I'm looking for a new, uh,
barbecue grill.

01:41.535 --> 01:42.703
What do you think?

01:42.736 --> 01:44.872
New? What's wrong
with the one you have?

01:44.905 --> 01:45.906
This one's better.

01:45.939 --> 01:46.974
It's got more features.

01:47.007 --> 01:50.478
Sounds a bit... conspicuously
consumptive to me.

01:50.511 --> 01:54.615
I, you know, I could say the
same about you, uh, that bag,

01:54.648 --> 01:56.350
what is that 1,200 bucks?

01:56.384 --> 01:57.918
- Wow, touchГ©.
- Huh?

01:57.951 --> 02:00.721
You know what, I'm remembering
that I already had breakfast.

02:00.754 --> 02:02.823
And so I'm
actually going to...

02:02.856 --> 02:03.491
Hold on.

02:04.658 --> 02:06.560
I propose a little wager.

02:06.594 --> 02:07.728
All right?

02:07.761 --> 02:10.198
For the next 30 days,

02:10.231 --> 02:11.799
your father and I
buy nothing new.

02:11.832 --> 02:13.167
Nothing.

02:13.201 --> 02:14.668
Except for food
and staple items.

02:14.702 --> 02:16.237
(phone rings)
All right, I'm on.

02:16.270 --> 02:17.104
And you be a witness.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.240
No, I don't want to have
anything at all

02:19.273 --> 02:20.208
to do with...

02:20.241 --> 02:22.743
Charles Eppes.

02:22.776 --> 02:25.779
Uh, yeah, I can be there
in about 20 minutes.

02:25.813 --> 02:26.914
Sure.

02:26.947 --> 02:28.349
I got to go.

02:28.382 --> 02:30.784
WOMAN:
Victim's John Walton, 37,

02:30.818 --> 02:32.553
science and technology
reporter.

02:32.586 --> 02:34.388
Uh-huh and the device
was a letter bomb?

02:34.422 --> 02:36.290
Yup. It originated
in the mailroom.

02:36.324 --> 02:38.426
Witness says
he saw the flash.

02:38.459 --> 02:41.462
Next thing he knew, he was on
his back, looking up at EMT.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.597
Besides my ATF team,

02:43.631 --> 02:46.434
a Bomb Squad and a Postal
Investigator are on-site.

02:46.467 --> 02:48.302
Well, where's
the FBI?

02:48.336 --> 02:49.237
DON:
Hey.

02:49.270 --> 02:51.905
What's up beating us
to the crime scene?

02:51.939 --> 02:53.841
I'm the one who called
your brother, Agent Eppes.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.943
I know he worked on the
recruitment center bombings.

02:55.976 --> 02:57.278
And before that, the backdraft

02:57.311 --> 02:58.312
arson investigation.

02:58.346 --> 02:59.380
- That's right.
- Yeah.

02:59.413 --> 03:00.581
What's your name?

03:00.614 --> 03:02.783
ATF Agent
Jessica Malloy.

03:02.816 --> 03:04.218
- How you doing, Malloy?
- Good.

03:04.252 --> 03:05.453
It's good to have you
on board.

03:05.486 --> 03:07.555
Your reputation precedes you.

03:07.588 --> 03:09.790
Nikki Davis was a friend
of mine.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.594
She was a
good agent, huh?

03:15.296 --> 03:17.331
So, what are we
looking at here?

03:17.365 --> 03:21.302
High explosive, uh, shaped
charge would be my best bet.

03:21.335 --> 03:23.504
Uh, targeted.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.573
You know, this is a classic
Misznay-Schardin Effect--

03:25.606 --> 03:29.410
expanding gas and energy focused
away from and perpendicular

03:29.443 --> 03:31.312
to the surface of the explosive.

03:31.345 --> 03:34.315
I knew I called
the right guy.

03:34.348 --> 03:36.450
Explosions are all about
physics, you know, about math--

03:36.484 --> 03:39.253
burn rates, brisance,
pressure waves.

03:39.287 --> 03:43.291
Everything in this room tells us
a story about the blast.

03:43.324 --> 03:44.325
It's like a...

03:44.358 --> 03:46.294
hand pounding a table.

03:46.327 --> 03:47.728
By the way the objects
are displaced,

03:47.761 --> 03:49.597
I can tell you
the size of the hand,

03:49.630 --> 03:50.731
how tight the grip,

03:50.764 --> 03:53.033
how much energy
it imparted on impact...

03:53.066 --> 03:54.635
just like I can analyze

03:54.668 --> 03:56.570
what kind of bomb
we're looking at here.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.739
Yeah, I guess you called
the right guy, huh.

03:58.772 --> 04:01.475
It's too late
to help Walton.

04:01.509 --> 04:02.843
DAVID: Let's hope
we're not late again.

04:15.789 --> 04:18.759
WOMAN: I'm not sure
what I can tell you.

04:18.792 --> 04:21.429
John wasn't the type
to make enemies.

04:21.462 --> 04:24.532
Just two hours ago
he was right here,

04:24.565 --> 04:26.734
kissing the kids good-bye.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.069
What about your husband's work?

04:29.102 --> 04:31.472
I imagine as a reporter,
he may have riled some people,

04:31.505 --> 04:33.307
and maybe received some threats.

04:33.341 --> 04:37.511
The only problem John ever had
on the Science Desk was

04:37.545 --> 04:39.747
when someone threatened
to sue him.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.081
Who?

04:41.114 --> 04:44.952
Guy said...

04:44.985 --> 04:49.022
he was being accused
of a crime he didn't commit.

04:49.056 --> 04:51.825
Do you remember
why they wanted to sue him?

04:51.859 --> 04:53.361
John was covering

04:53.394 --> 04:59.400
a story on a series of attacks
on laboratories...

05:00.768 --> 05:03.103
...bombings.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.305
Oh, my God.

05:08.476 --> 05:10.778
JESSICA:
DNA Bomber case,

05:10.811 --> 05:12.012
three years ago.

05:12.045 --> 05:15.349
A series of letter-bombs were
sent to biotechnology labs.

05:15.383 --> 05:16.684
Killed four people,

05:16.717 --> 05:19.420
the last one a San Francisco
Bomb Squad sergeant.

05:19.453 --> 05:20.521
Bill Regan.

05:20.554 --> 05:22.423
We trained together
in Huntsville.

05:22.456 --> 05:24.425
A college kid, Jason Aronow,

05:24.458 --> 05:26.093
pled guilty
to the DNA bombings.

05:26.126 --> 05:27.528
He's serving
a life sentence.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.430
What's the deal,
he was trying to sue Walton?

05:29.463 --> 05:32.566
No, that was Emmett Glaser.

05:32.600 --> 05:33.567
Former physics
professor.

05:33.601 --> 05:34.802
Aronow was a student
of his.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.604
Glaser consulted
for DOD

05:36.637 --> 05:39.039
on mini-explosives.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.374
And was fired
for criticizing work

05:40.408 --> 05:41.942
they were doing
on biotechnology.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.911
Now, shortly after that,
a manifesto

05:43.944 --> 05:47.114
attacking biotech surfaced
on the Internet.

05:47.147 --> 05:48.616
And the DNA Bomber attacks
followed.

05:48.649 --> 05:50.117
Now,
the bombs all had

05:50.150 --> 05:52.119
a signature stamped
on a component,

05:52.152 --> 05:54.121
same as the manifesto's
sign-off:

05:54.154 --> 05:56.890
"RF59"...
"RF59."

05:56.924 --> 05:58.859
Glaser was a suspect for months.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.429
Yeah, but he didn't do it.

06:01.462 --> 06:02.496
Well, he didn't
get caught.

06:02.530 --> 06:04.131
Aronow was his student...

06:04.164 --> 06:07.435
and I never did buy a
19-year-old kid acting alone.

06:07.468 --> 06:08.969
All right, well,
let's say Glaser is our guy.

06:09.002 --> 06:11.071
It's been three years;
why would he start up again now?

06:11.104 --> 06:14.408
Walton was not the only guy
that Glaser tried to sue....

06:14.442 --> 06:15.976
he just lost his last appeal

06:16.009 --> 06:17.978
against the U.S. Government
a few months ago.

06:18.011 --> 06:19.647
So, what?

06:19.680 --> 06:21.415
Some other way
of trying to get payback?

06:32.560 --> 06:35.596
The ATF identified
the explosive as C4.

06:35.629 --> 06:37.097
They're sending over
the ballistics data.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.732
Great, with my trajectory
calculations,

06:38.766 --> 06:40.901
we'll get an accurate
image of that bomb.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.135
(knocking)
Hey.

06:42.169 --> 06:44.838
a CD player I could borrow?have

06:44.872 --> 06:46.474
No, sorry. Mine's at home.

06:46.507 --> 06:48.175
I got my MP3 and my headphones?

06:48.208 --> 06:51.545
No. Music should be
embraced, not worn.

06:51.579 --> 06:53.213
You know, I think you can buy a
new one for pretty cheap.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.582
(scoffs)

06:54.615 --> 06:56.183
This is the bet, right?

06:56.216 --> 06:57.585
(chuckling):
Yeah.

06:57.618 --> 06:59.086
She and my dad made a bet

06:59.119 --> 07:00.488
that they couldn't
go a month

07:00.521 --> 07:02.556
without purchasing
a new consumer item.

07:02.590 --> 07:03.457
Hey,

07:03.491 --> 07:04.324
we could just list this

07:04.357 --> 07:06.494
under "items necessary
for survival"?

07:06.527 --> 07:09.162
Now, now, Millie,
the bet was your idea.

07:09.196 --> 07:10.864
Oh, thought so.

07:10.898 --> 07:12.533
You know what? Don't forget--

07:12.566 --> 07:15.536
I approve your
research funding, hmm?

07:15.569 --> 07:18.071
You'd better hope
my pen doesn't break.

07:20.173 --> 07:21.174
Hey.

07:21.208 --> 07:22.009
So, what do you got?

07:22.042 --> 07:23.977
Well, uh, working
with your techs,

07:24.011 --> 07:25.879
using recovered components,
computer modeling.

07:25.913 --> 07:28.181
I reconstructed the bomb
that killed John Walton.

07:28.215 --> 07:31.218
Well, and I then found a
match to four other devices

07:31.251 --> 07:32.352
in the FBI's database.

07:32.385 --> 07:35.489
JESSICA: All from the DNA Bomber
attacks three years ago.

07:35.523 --> 07:36.624
CHARLIE:
All resembling bombs

07:36.657 --> 07:38.626
that Glaser designed
for the military.

07:38.659 --> 07:41.228
Now, we know Glaser fits
the psych profile.

07:41.261 --> 07:43.897
Why do you keep skipping
over the small fact

07:43.931 --> 07:45.566
that this guy was cleared
three years ago?

07:45.599 --> 07:47.535
(phone ringing) he wasn't.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.036
Yeah, well, your case
fell apart.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.704
You know, I'm not making
the same mistake.

07:50.738 --> 07:53.240
DON:
Eppes.

07:53.273 --> 07:54.942
Ah, damn.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.010
All right, yeah, yeah,
we're on our way.

07:57.044 --> 07:58.546
Okay. You'd better come with me.

07:58.579 --> 07:59.913
We'll see you later,
Charlie.

08:02.550 --> 08:03.984
(helicopter rotors whirring)

08:04.017 --> 08:06.887
(indistinct radio transmission)

08:10.791 --> 08:12.693
So, the victim's
Leonard Tobin.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.528
Postal clerk said
he picked up his mail.

08:14.562 --> 08:16.597
And then a witness saw him
checking it in his car

08:16.630 --> 08:19.066
before the blast.
Tobin?

08:19.099 --> 08:21.268
Tobin worked at DOD,
same time as Glaser.

08:21.301 --> 08:24.004
What do you mean, he's
like a biotech guy, too?

08:24.037 --> 08:26.306
Glaser sent him
angry e-mails

08:26.339 --> 08:29.276
using the same language
as the RF59 Manifesto.

08:29.309 --> 08:32.112
Tobin was the first to point
to Glaser as a suspect.

08:32.145 --> 08:35.315
So, two of Glaser's enemies
blown up in two days.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.017
LIZ:
Hey!

08:37.050 --> 08:38.786
You guys, I need to
show you something.

08:38.819 --> 08:40.754
What have you got?

08:42.289 --> 08:44.224
Check it out.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.799
"RF59."

08:51.832 --> 08:54.902
Bomber's signatures were
never public.

08:54.935 --> 08:56.770
The only ones who know about it
are us

08:56.804 --> 08:58.305
and whoever was
behind the bombings.

08:58.338 --> 09:00.574
This is not a copycat.

09:00.608 --> 09:02.275
This is Glaser.

09:04.645 --> 09:07.581
(doorbell rings)

09:13.020 --> 09:15.022
Can I help you?

09:15.055 --> 09:16.890
FBI, Mr. Glaser.

09:16.924 --> 09:18.726
We need to talk
to your son.

09:18.759 --> 09:20.928
Haven't you people
hounded him enough?

09:20.961 --> 09:23.263
Two men are dead,

09:23.296 --> 09:24.632
Mr. Glaser.

09:24.665 --> 09:25.966
One of them as
a father, also--

09:25.999 --> 09:28.035
and his two children will
never see him again.

09:29.803 --> 09:31.271
Where is he?

09:31.304 --> 09:33.106
I don't know.

09:33.140 --> 09:36.043
The only time I see him
is when he needs money.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.344
He can't get work,

09:37.377 --> 09:39.112
thanks to you people.

09:39.146 --> 09:40.580
When's the last time
he was here?

09:41.682 --> 09:43.350
About a month ago.

09:43.383 --> 09:45.218
He slept in his old room
in the attic

09:45.252 --> 09:46.353
for a couple
of days.

09:46.386 --> 09:48.656
We're gonna need
to take a look, sir.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.357
Have you people got a warrant?

09:52.793 --> 09:54.795
Yeah.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.730
I can't vouch

09:56.764 --> 09:58.699
for the condition
of the floorboards.

09:58.732 --> 10:01.669
If you break your
leg, it's on you.

10:04.171 --> 10:06.674
Starting to see
where Glaser Junior

10:06.707 --> 10:08.676
inherits his good
will toward men.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.310
Mm.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.081
Oh...

10:14.114 --> 10:16.650
Check this out.

10:16.684 --> 10:20.420
Anybody need a back issue
of Popular Bomber?

10:20.453 --> 10:24.024
Man has maintained an
unhealthy interest.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.192
Take a look
at the photo

10:25.225 --> 10:27.060
of victim number two,
Leonard Tobin.

10:29.162 --> 10:32.199
Looks like you made the wall
of shame, as well.

10:36.804 --> 10:39.106
Mom will be so proud.

10:39.139 --> 10:42.175
Take a look at this.

10:42.209 --> 10:43.343
Look familiar?

10:43.376 --> 10:45.713
Bomb components.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.715
I think I've seen
this before.

10:49.216 --> 10:51.952
Looks like we've
got our guy.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.654
Yeah, only we don't.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.896
The diagrams and components
found at Glaser's place

11:02.930 --> 11:04.965
match the bombs
that killed Walton and Tobin.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.800
We didn't find
any explosives.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.335
So if he's planning
more attacks,

11:08.368 --> 11:09.469
he's got the stuff with him.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.839
No, or it's already
in the mail.

11:11.872 --> 11:15.308
Since he lost his job,
Glaser's fallen off the grid.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.810
We're going
through the case files

11:16.844 --> 11:18.979
to see who else
he might be targeting.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.481
Well, I can help
with the target analysis.

11:21.514 --> 11:24.852
I bet he's in Lake Arrowhead.

11:24.885 --> 11:28.321
Leonard Tobin received a call
from a phone booth 20 miles away

11:28.355 --> 11:31.158
from the phone the bomber
used to call Walton.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.793
Right, and postal police
say the envelopes came

11:32.826 --> 11:35.963
from two different
mailboxes 15 miles apart.

11:35.996 --> 11:39.232
We traced several components
to a hardware store over here.

11:39.266 --> 11:40.467
Well, I mean,
look at this.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.002
This is a huge area.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.772
Yeah, but you know,
by masking his location,

11:44.805 --> 11:47.507
what he's really doing is, he's
providing us with a pattern.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.310
You know, a magnet repels
a group of objects

11:50.343 --> 11:51.979
with the same charge.

11:52.012 --> 11:53.947
The magnet will repel
the objects

11:53.981 --> 11:57.450
just like our suspect will try
to put the maximum distance

11:57.484 --> 12:01.321
he can between himself
and the locations he visited.

12:01.354 --> 12:04.324
So I'll start geo-profiling,
I'll analyze the pattern,

12:04.357 --> 12:06.827
assign some probabilities
and create a search area.

12:06.860 --> 12:07.861
How soon?

12:07.895 --> 12:10.063
Day, more or less.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.866
Yeah, how about less?

12:12.900 --> 12:14.868
You know, we found letters
at Glaser's place,

12:14.902 --> 12:16.403
correspondence between
him and

12:16.436 --> 12:18.405
his former student,
Jason Aronow.

12:18.438 --> 12:20.073
The guy doing time
for the DNA bombings?

12:20.107 --> 12:22.810
Yeah, Glaser stayed in touch
during Aronow's trial,

12:22.843 --> 12:24.377
you know, "moral support."

12:24.411 --> 12:26.847
If they were in touch then,
maybe they're still in touch.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.816
All right, fine,
let's talk to him.

12:32.052 --> 12:34.922
CORRECTIONS OFFICER:
Here to see No-Knuckles, huh?

12:34.955 --> 12:36.056
DAVID:
"No-Knuckles"?

12:36.089 --> 12:37.991
Aronow, that's what
we call him.

12:38.025 --> 12:40.060
Tried to blow himself up
first month he was here

12:40.093 --> 12:41.895
with a bomb made out
of cleaning solvents.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.931
Doc had to stitch
his hands back together.

12:43.964 --> 12:45.966
Been off custodial
detail ever since.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.968
We read his file.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.336
Kid's a freak. Spent all his
time on the Internet

12:49.369 --> 12:51.404
till we found out he was
talking to other bomb-nuts.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.807
(keys jangle in lock)
He's all yours.

12:56.476 --> 13:00.814
Jason Aronow,
Agent Sinclair, FBI.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.416
Agent Malloy, ATF.

13:03.450 --> 13:06.419
Agent Malloy, it's a pleasure.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.588
You agreed to waive counsel?

13:08.621 --> 13:10.824
Lot of good it
did me last time.

13:10.858 --> 13:15.428
You pled guilty to four
bombings, that's four murders.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.064
What did you expect?

13:17.097 --> 13:22.469
Doesn't a troubled childhood
count for anything anymore?

13:22.502 --> 13:24.471
Emmett Glaser, your old
professor, you were pen-pals.

13:24.504 --> 13:25.605
Still the case?

13:25.638 --> 13:28.408
I saw the bombings on the news.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.946
Must be dГ©jГ  vu for you, Agent.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.882
Of course, you were
off the case

13:34.915 --> 13:36.449
by the time they came
knocking on my door.

13:36.483 --> 13:39.019
Shame.

13:39.052 --> 13:40.187
We'd have had fun.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.455
Emmett Glaser, Jason.

13:42.489 --> 13:45.959
A man not afraid
to tell the truth.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.127
Which is?

13:47.160 --> 13:51.131
Biotechnology isn't a solution.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.300
It's a "final solution."

13:53.333 --> 13:56.336
You read my file:
paranoid schizo.

13:56.369 --> 13:58.906
Nothing a little gene therapy
can't fix...

13:58.939 --> 14:01.141
or select out.

14:01.174 --> 14:04.577
Biotech is going to make
people like me extinct.

14:04.611 --> 14:07.047
Come on, Jason,
you didn't have the skills

14:07.080 --> 14:09.016
to do all those bombings.

14:09.049 --> 14:10.350
You couldn't even
blow yourself up.

14:10.383 --> 14:12.552
'Cause I didn't have
what I needed.

14:12.585 --> 14:15.088
Emmett Glaser is
a man of ideas,

14:15.122 --> 14:17.991
and I'm a man of action.

14:18.025 --> 14:21.061
The pure energy
at the point of detonation.

14:21.094 --> 14:24.097
You ever want to feel
what that's like...

14:24.131 --> 14:26.599
you just let me know.

14:26.633 --> 14:30.337
Oh, I know what it's like.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.106
I saw photos
of my friend Bill Regan

14:33.140 --> 14:36.944
after he was blown apart
by a bomb you claim you built.

14:36.977 --> 14:40.113
They had to scrape him
off the pavement,

14:40.147 --> 14:44.251
pry parts of him
out of the grill of an SUV.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.086
You're turning me on.

14:55.628 --> 14:56.964
Oh, hey.
Hey.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.565
How's the target analysis going?

14:58.598 --> 15:00.233
It's gone.

15:00.267 --> 15:01.601
I sent it two hours ago.

15:01.634 --> 15:03.370
Look at you.

15:03.403 --> 15:04.671
Check this out.

15:04.704 --> 15:06.373
This is research
for your geo-profiling?

15:06.406 --> 15:07.474
Yeah, this guy,

15:07.507 --> 15:11.044
Emmett Glaser
attended Caltech at 14,

15:11.078 --> 15:12.379
and studied under Feynman.

15:12.412 --> 15:15.048
Wound up consulting for DOD--
he's a wunderkind.

15:15.082 --> 15:16.649
Who also lived with his father.

15:16.683 --> 15:19.286
Yeah. Listen to this, this is...

15:19.319 --> 15:22.389
this is from his manifesto:

15:22.422 --> 15:26.393
"When biotechnology
creates a marketplace

15:26.426 --> 15:30.097
"where genetic material,
who we are,

15:30.130 --> 15:33.100
"can be bought and sold
like a slave on the block,

15:33.133 --> 15:34.534
there is no freedom there."

15:34.567 --> 15:37.337
Well, even the Unabomber
had his moments.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.572
You know, obviously,
I don't identify with this guy,

15:39.606 --> 15:43.143
but, you know,
on a purely intellectual level,

15:43.176 --> 15:45.312
I kind of get what he's saying.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.280
It kind of bothers me.

15:49.116 --> 15:51.051
(people yelling)

15:52.385 --> 15:54.321
(tires screech,
engine turns off)

15:56.556 --> 15:58.191
- Hey, Don.
- What's the story?

15:58.225 --> 16:00.060
Well, Amita's target
list paid off.

16:00.093 --> 16:01.028
So another one?

16:01.061 --> 16:02.195
Yeah, screener in the
mailroom caught it.

16:02.229 --> 16:05.132
It was addressed to the judge
in the DNA bomber case.

16:05.165 --> 16:06.599
So the bomb squad
rolled on the call.

16:06.633 --> 16:07.500
Evacuated the courthouse.

16:07.534 --> 16:09.502
- Where's it at?
- The robot's got it.

16:16.376 --> 16:18.511
Guys. Jessica.
Hey.

16:18.545 --> 16:20.480
The return address
is Rancho Feliz.

16:20.513 --> 16:22.182
90059.

16:22.215 --> 16:23.783
No such address.

16:23.816 --> 16:26.119
RF59, he's
playing with us.

16:38.565 --> 16:40.200
I'm ready to grab an X-ray pic.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.774
Oh, they look pretty
similar to me, right?

16:47.807 --> 16:50.710
Nice for our bomber
to leave us a roadmap.

16:50.743 --> 16:53.180
Eddie, you went to school
on the diagram.

16:53.213 --> 16:55.048
- Detonate it.
- Roger that.

17:03.156 --> 17:05.492
Robot's in firing position.

17:05.525 --> 17:06.793
Load the saline charge.

17:08.761 --> 17:11.564
(clicking)

17:14.167 --> 17:15.402
Locked and loaded, boss.

17:15.435 --> 17:16.536
Light it up.

17:22.109 --> 17:23.410
HAZLETT:
Well, looking good.

17:23.443 --> 17:24.411
(two beeps)

17:24.444 --> 17:25.578
That's it.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.347
Fire in the hole!

17:32.185 --> 17:35.255
- Start the bag-and-tag.
- Roger that.

17:35.288 --> 17:38.691
Bomb squad one, stand by.
We're moving in.

17:38.725 --> 17:41.161
Looks like a good hit.
Hang on.

17:43.330 --> 17:44.564
Yeah, we're good. Good.

17:44.597 --> 17:47.100
Glaser's just giving us
more rope to hang him.

17:47.134 --> 17:49.369
I mean, he's got to know
we're screening the mail.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.204
Why does he stick
to the same M.O.

17:51.238 --> 17:53.306
and just keep
handing us evidence?

17:53.340 --> 17:55.208
What about that courthouse?

17:55.242 --> 17:57.210
He knew we'd evacuate, right?

17:57.244 --> 17:59.112
'Cause he wanted to sneak in.

18:03.216 --> 18:05.485
LIZ: During the evacuation,
someone entered that courthouse

18:05.518 --> 18:06.686
and downloaded the case files

18:06.719 --> 18:07.887
from the DNA bomber
investigation.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.191
That means Glaser's got names
and addresses of everyone.

18:11.224 --> 18:13.593
Judges, witnesses,
confidential informants.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.795
Target list just got
a hell of a lot longer.

18:15.828 --> 18:17.664
There's no way we can
protect all of them.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.732
All right, I'll check with you
guys in a little bit, all right?

18:19.766 --> 18:21.301
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, bro.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.736
So using the data points
we traced to Glaser,

18:23.770 --> 18:26.373
I was able to triangulate
a preliminary search area.

18:26.406 --> 18:28.708
Well, it'd better
be preliminary.

18:28.741 --> 18:32.245
Well, you know, he doesn't own
a car, so that limits his range.

18:32.279 --> 18:34.514
And then I factored
in his psych profile.

18:34.547 --> 18:37.417
He's a loner,
he anti-social.

18:37.450 --> 18:40.187
Right, so here's what I,
what I got.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.921
(beep)

18:41.954 --> 18:43.723
Charlie, I mean, there's got
to be at least a dozen

18:43.756 --> 18:45.325
square miles of woods here.

18:45.358 --> 18:46.826
12.7.

18:46.859 --> 18:49.362
Checked out Jason Aronow's
online activity.

18:49.396 --> 18:51.898
Turns out the kid's been in
contact with Glaser twice.

18:51.931 --> 18:54.267
But the e-mails don't say
anything incriminating.

18:54.301 --> 18:55.402
Did we trace it?

18:55.435 --> 18:57.504
Glaser logged on from several

18:57.537 --> 18:59.739
Internet cafes in the
Lake Arrowhead area.

18:59.772 --> 19:01.908
We showed his photo around,
no leads.

19:01.941 --> 19:03.376
May I see the file?

19:03.410 --> 19:04.744
Yeah, sure.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.679
You know, more
data translates

19:06.713 --> 19:08.248
to greater refinement.

19:08.281 --> 19:10.250
Greater refinement
means less area.

19:10.283 --> 19:12.719
(keyboard clacking)

19:16.223 --> 19:17.156
That better?

19:19.359 --> 19:20.960
Yeah, that's what I'm talking
about, Charlie!

19:20.993 --> 19:22.595
All right, let's get eyes
in these areas.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.264
Okay, roll everything
we've got, all right?

19:31.471 --> 19:33.440
Tea?

19:33.473 --> 19:35.975
Yeah, I saw Granger
make that coffee.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.711
Hey, what was that look
you gave me

19:38.745 --> 19:40.913
when Malloy mentioned
Nikki Davis?

19:40.947 --> 19:43.250
Right, like, "Why is it
all your girlfriends

19:43.283 --> 19:45.452
are people you've
worked with?"

19:45.485 --> 19:47.454
The hours we put in...

19:47.487 --> 19:49.256
that's just the way it is.

19:49.289 --> 19:50.757
It's what we do

19:50.790 --> 19:53.693
after we punch out
that makes the difference.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.428
Hey, you ever,
uh, ice-skate?

19:56.529 --> 19:58.731
Yeah. Do you?

19:58.765 --> 20:01.234
Actually I played
hockey as a kid.

20:01.268 --> 20:04.804
Okay, I didn't figure you
for sequins and figure eights.

20:04.837 --> 20:07.474
You never know, it could be
the secret life of Don Eppes.

20:07.507 --> 20:09.909
Yeah, I'm free Friday.

20:09.942 --> 20:12.312
All right, good. So maybe dinner
after, something like that?

20:12.345 --> 20:14.414
Don, we've found Glaser.

20:22.021 --> 20:23.956
(tapping on glass)
COLBY: Delivery.

20:26.025 --> 20:27.394
Leave it on the step.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.362
I can't, sir,
I need a signature.

20:29.396 --> 20:31.498
On the step!

20:31.531 --> 20:34.567
Or leave me alone.

20:34.601 --> 20:36.836
Looks like he's building
another bomb. We gotta go in.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.441
Okay, sir, you win.

20:41.474 --> 20:42.942
I'll leave it here on the door.

20:45.512 --> 20:48.948
FBI! Put your hands
where I can see them.

20:48.981 --> 20:50.683
Where I can
see them.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.385
Step away from the desk.

20:54.687 --> 20:59.459
Now put your hands behind
your head and turn around.

20:59.492 --> 21:02.395
By the way, the real delivery
guy sleeps in his truck

21:02.429 --> 21:04.731
between 3:00 and 3:30.

21:04.764 --> 21:07.334
Little detail for your files.

21:07.367 --> 21:09.736
Why am I being
so honored this time?

21:09.769 --> 21:11.338
Why do you think, Glaser?

21:11.371 --> 21:13.940
I can guess now.

21:15.408 --> 21:17.777
Let's get a bomb
squad in here.

21:17.810 --> 21:19.346
Yes, do.

21:19.379 --> 21:20.279
They can save us all

21:20.313 --> 21:22.615
from the toy I'm building
for my nephew.

21:26.052 --> 21:26.986
Wish I could say

21:27.019 --> 21:29.356
it's nice to see you again,
Agent Malloy.

21:29.389 --> 21:30.890
Yeah, feeling's mutual.

21:54.714 --> 21:56.749
What? You're not a fan
of your own work?

21:56.783 --> 21:58.885
My client is not responsible
for the death of these men.

21:58.918 --> 22:01.554
That's not what the evidence
says, Counselor.

22:01.588 --> 22:03.756
Postmarks,
phone calls,

22:03.790 --> 22:05.725
purchases,
not to mention

22:05.758 --> 22:07.794
what we found
at "daddy's house."

22:07.827 --> 22:09.462
I appreciate
you putting

22:09.496 --> 22:10.897
my picture up on the wall.

22:10.930 --> 22:12.699
That's all
circumstantial evidence.

22:12.732 --> 22:14.501
You going to let this bozo

22:14.534 --> 22:16.569
do all the
talking for you?

22:16.603 --> 22:20.106
You weren't this shy when
you wrote your RF59 manifesto.

22:20.139 --> 22:22.942
Look, I don't know
about your supposed "evidence."

22:22.975 --> 22:25.111
As for my vitriol,
it's true I haven't let go.

22:25.144 --> 22:26.112
You wouldn't either.

22:26.145 --> 22:27.580
Oh, yeah, why's that?

22:27.614 --> 22:30.116
You live with agents
following you incessantly,

22:30.149 --> 22:33.420
questioning colleagues,
e-mailing employers,

22:33.453 --> 22:35.655
leaks to the press
destroying your reputation.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.390
MALLOY:
You recognize that?

22:37.424 --> 22:39.426
Signature on
your manifesto,

22:39.459 --> 22:40.760
on your bombs.

22:40.793 --> 22:42.128
You and that kid are
the only ones

22:42.161 --> 22:43.162
who know about it.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.631
You know about it.

22:44.664 --> 22:46.165
There's some more of your work.

22:46.198 --> 22:49.536
Mary Murphy, Armin Shah,

22:49.569 --> 22:50.970
Richard Ells,

22:51.003 --> 22:53.039
and this one,
this is not from the case file.

22:53.072 --> 22:54.140
This is mine.

22:54.173 --> 22:55.141
Look at it.

22:55.174 --> 22:57.910
Hey, I said
look at it!

22:57.944 --> 23:01.781
This is Bill Regan, San
Francisco Bomb Squad,

23:01.814 --> 23:03.683
left behind a
wife and a child.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.117
- This isn't even part of...

23:05.151 --> 23:08.455
Shut up!
I am not done!

23:08.488 --> 23:11.458
His son Sean was
just three years old

23:11.491 --> 23:12.992
when his father was killed
by you.

23:13.025 --> 23:14.661
This case has already
been tried, Malloy.

23:14.694 --> 23:16.829
Yeah, and he let his student
take the fall for it.

23:16.863 --> 23:19.632
I can't be held responsible
for one young man perverting

23:19.666 --> 23:21.768
my discourse
into a blueprint for mayhem.

23:21.801 --> 23:24.437
You provided a hell of a lot
more than just "discourse."

23:24.471 --> 23:26.606
I told Jason
what he did was wrong.

23:26.639 --> 23:28.441
Oh, playing
to the judge's sympathy,

23:28.475 --> 23:29.776
you psychopathic scumbag.

23:29.809 --> 23:30.910
Hey, hey.

23:30.943 --> 23:31.611
You know, I've looked at
your "overwhelming" evidence

23:31.644 --> 23:33.746
and frankly, I'm underwhelmed.

23:33.780 --> 23:34.747
We're done here.

23:34.781 --> 23:35.715
No, we are not done!

23:35.748 --> 23:38.518
Yeah, Jessica, we are.

23:43.523 --> 23:46.158
I refer you to the "Axiom
of Coherent States,"

23:46.192 --> 23:48.828
a little quantum mechanics
principle.

23:48.861 --> 23:50.029
Look it up.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.968
Here all night?

23:56.002 --> 23:56.969
Mm.

23:57.003 --> 23:58.605
Just since about 5:00 A.M.

23:58.638 --> 23:59.672
You find a CD player?

23:59.706 --> 24:02.909
No, no, but I found
an undergrad physics major,

24:02.942 --> 24:05.578
a hunk o' burning brain who
said he'd rebuild mine for me.

24:05.612 --> 24:06.546
- Oh...
- Done.

24:06.579 --> 24:07.980
- Millie, that's cheating.
- No, it isn't.

24:08.014 --> 24:09.816
Yes, it-- yes, it is.

24:09.849 --> 24:11.851
You're buying some
starving student's services.

24:11.884 --> 24:13.052
No, I'm not buying
anything.

24:13.085 --> 24:14.521
I am letting him.

24:14.554 --> 24:15.855
(knocks)
Hi.

24:15.888 --> 24:17.056
Oh, Bradley, come in.

24:17.089 --> 24:18.825
All done?s.

24:18.858 --> 24:20.593
Hello.

24:20.627 --> 24:21.961
I had a little setback,
Dr. Finch.

24:21.994 --> 24:23.029
What?

24:23.062 --> 24:24.897
It would enhance
the sound quality,

24:24.931 --> 24:25.732
but...

24:25.765 --> 24:27.166
(Millie gasps)

24:27.199 --> 24:28.868
My Vivaldi?

24:28.901 --> 24:29.869
(snorts)

24:29.902 --> 24:31.771
Oh, no.

24:31.804 --> 24:32.905
Why?

24:32.939 --> 24:33.906
I'm sorry.

24:33.940 --> 24:34.907
Oh, it's okay.

24:34.941 --> 24:36.709
Thank you.

24:36.743 --> 24:38.110
So check
this out.

24:38.144 --> 24:40.880
This is the interview
with the suspect

24:40.913 --> 24:41.848
in the bomber case.

24:41.881 --> 24:42.715
"Coherent States"?

24:42.749 --> 24:44.784
Yeah, yeah, he seems
oddly confident

24:44.817 --> 24:47.153
that, that the evidence
against him won't hold.

24:47.186 --> 24:49.221
I-I don't know, I
just don't see it.

24:49.255 --> 24:50.823
Well, maybe you need
a little more caffeine.

24:57.930 --> 24:59.832
That's it.
What?

24:59.866 --> 25:00.900
"Coherent States."

25:00.933 --> 25:03.936
Redundancy,
over-completeness.

25:03.970 --> 25:05.071
Here.

25:05.104 --> 25:08.174
These are the data points
that I used to triangulate

25:08.207 --> 25:09.208
the suspect's location.

25:09.241 --> 25:10.543
Okay, looks good to me.

25:10.577 --> 25:11.844
Too good, too good.

25:11.878 --> 25:13.045
Where are the outliers?

25:13.079 --> 25:14.280
How many times have you seen

25:14.313 --> 25:16.683
this much data
and nothing's out of place,

25:16.716 --> 25:18.951
where you have
just exactly what you need?

25:18.985 --> 25:21.888
Almost never.

25:22.989 --> 25:25.257
DON:
"Too good"?

25:25.291 --> 25:26.626
Wha-What are you
talking about?

25:26.659 --> 25:27.894
(stammering)

25:27.927 --> 25:30.029
I'm saying I think
we may have the wrong man.

25:30.062 --> 25:32.932
It's what Glaser said
about "Coherent States,"

25:32.965 --> 25:34.867
th-tha-that all the evidence
points to him

25:34.901 --> 25:35.902
and, and only him.

25:35.935 --> 25:36.769
You know
what that's like?

25:36.803 --> 25:38.571
That's like a perfect storm
of data.

25:38.605 --> 25:40.640
That's like--
that's an improbable event.

25:40.673 --> 25:41.974
Come on, Charlie, the
guy's playing you.

25:42.008 --> 25:43.342
It's not just the math,
all right?

25:43.375 --> 25:44.276
Okay.

25:44.310 --> 25:46.045
His manifesto,
his ideas,

25:46.078 --> 25:48.080
though extreme,
are not irrational.

25:48.114 --> 25:49.749
You know, he never
advocates violence.

25:49.782 --> 25:50.883
Well, so what?
The guy's a genius.

25:50.917 --> 25:51.951
Doesn't mean he's
not a murderer.

25:51.984 --> 25:53.853
- You're missing the point.
- What's the point?

25:53.886 --> 25:55.688
That you want to stand up
for one of your own here?

25:55.722 --> 25:56.723
What are you talking about?

25:56.756 --> 25:58.190
You know,
you're one to talk.

25:58.224 --> 25:59.959
an entire investigation...blew

25:59.992 --> 26:00.993
Hey, hey, easy.

26:01.027 --> 26:01.894
...and you covered his ass.

26:01.928 --> 26:03.596
Easy, pal.
You're here to help, right?

26:03.630 --> 26:04.764
You're not here
to create problems.

26:04.797 --> 26:06.032
You know what? Fine.

26:06.065 --> 26:08.968
But if Glaser's lawyer calls me
to the stand, I'm not gonna lie.

26:09.001 --> 26:10.336
I'm not going to
cover your ass.

26:14.240 --> 26:15.574
Come on, come on, come on!

26:15.608 --> 26:17.944
BASKETBALL ANNOUNCER: Five
seconds. This could be it--

26:17.977 --> 26:19.011
Damn it!

26:19.045 --> 26:21.748
he makes it, what an
incredible shot!

26:21.781 --> 26:23.182
Oh...

26:23.215 --> 26:24.751
(whimpers)
What's going on?

26:24.784 --> 26:26.385
It's a piece of crap.

26:26.418 --> 26:29.756
I don't even know why I bothered
taking it out of the garage.

26:29.789 --> 26:30.890
What's wrong with
the flatscreen?

26:30.923 --> 26:32.258
Broke.

26:32.291 --> 26:33.926
Bought it a year ago,
didn't make it to the playoffs.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.127
Oh, right, what's this?

26:35.161 --> 26:36.963
This Millie's bet
Charlie told me about?

26:36.996 --> 26:38.197
What, you can't
buy another one?

26:38.230 --> 26:38.998
Yeah, ridiculous.

26:39.031 --> 26:40.900
I should have kept
my mouth shut.

26:40.933 --> 26:43.002
So, uh,
I thought you were working

26:43.035 --> 26:44.637
around the clock
on that bomber case.

26:44.671 --> 26:46.973
- Nah, we got the guy.
- Oh, really?

26:47.006 --> 26:49.676
So why is your brother out in
the garage still working on it?

26:49.709 --> 26:50.609
Well, that guy, man.

26:50.643 --> 26:52.945
I guess he hates to
be wrong, you know?

26:52.979 --> 26:54.380
I mean, even
when he's right.

26:54.413 --> 26:56.248
He's just letting his
emotions get in the way.

26:56.282 --> 26:57.950
Yeah, something you'd never do.

26:57.984 --> 27:00.820
The guy wrote a manifesto,
you know, like the Unabomber.

27:00.853 --> 27:02.121
H-he wants to end
biotech research.

27:02.154 --> 27:03.389
So...

27:03.422 --> 27:07.126
You know, strong opinions does
not necessarily a killer make.

27:07.159 --> 27:08.961
In my day, people had...

27:08.995 --> 27:10.797
they had opinions
about a lot of stuff.

27:10.830 --> 27:12.031
Oh, come on.

27:12.064 --> 27:14.000
What, are you gonna give me the
First Amendment lecture again?

27:14.033 --> 27:15.835
Till you listen, yes.

27:15.868 --> 27:17.870
Dad, you're as bad as Charlie.

27:17.904 --> 27:20.439
Well, maybe, but have you
ever known your brother

27:20.472 --> 27:22.709
to let his emotions
trump his math?

27:32.184 --> 27:33.219
Hey, Charlie.

27:33.252 --> 27:34.987
Hey, yeah, no, I know, I...

27:35.021 --> 27:36.989
(stammers)

27:37.023 --> 27:39.091
I get caught up sometimes,
you know, in the math.

27:39.125 --> 27:40.092
All right, I understand.

27:40.126 --> 27:41.093
Listen.

27:41.127 --> 27:42.128
Listen, I'm here, okay?

27:42.161 --> 27:43.362
L-Let me hear what you got.

27:43.395 --> 27:44.363
Thanks.

27:44.396 --> 27:45.832
Here's the thing.

27:45.865 --> 27:47.867
Look, tracing
these bomber's movements gave us

27:47.900 --> 27:49.035
these 12 data points.

27:49.068 --> 27:50.336
Right?
Right, the search area.

27:50.369 --> 27:51.871
Right,
and all of them fit

27:51.904 --> 27:53.172
so perfectly into my equation.

27:53.205 --> 27:55.074
There's no strays,
no outliers.

27:55.107 --> 27:56.743
Well, good evidence is
good evidence.

27:56.776 --> 27:58.210
Not when it's too good.

27:58.244 --> 28:00.079
Y-You see what I'm...

28:00.112 --> 28:00.780
(sighs)

28:00.813 --> 28:04.083
Imagine, um...
here we go.

28:04.116 --> 28:07.787
Imagine we wanted
to create a square.

28:07.820 --> 28:08.955
Okay?
Okay.

28:08.988 --> 28:10.322
You need four points,
right?

28:10.356 --> 28:12.191
Mm-hmm.
Four.

28:12.224 --> 28:15.127
You don't need four
more points, right?

28:15.161 --> 28:16.362
That's exactly what I have,
though.

28:16.395 --> 28:19.899
That's more data than I need
here and it all fits together

28:19.932 --> 28:21.067
so perfectly.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.169
Right, but, I mean, that
doesn't mean it's impossible.

28:23.202 --> 28:28.174
Yeah, but given Glaser's
grasp of these concepts,

28:28.207 --> 28:31.410
don't you see how he would be
a fool to behave in this way?

28:32.511 --> 28:35.848
See what I'm saying?

28:38.785 --> 28:40.186
You going to stick around
for dinner?

28:40.219 --> 28:43.089
No, you know, I'm gonna
go back to work, right?

28:46.893 --> 28:49.962
We're going back through the
evidence, including the files

28:49.996 --> 28:51.831
in the original DNA
Bomber investigation.

28:51.864 --> 28:53.299
I think we might
have caught a break.

28:53.332 --> 28:54.400
Oh, yeah?

28:54.433 --> 28:56.502
Yeah, Jason Aronow was
trying to dump a flash drive

28:56.535 --> 28:58.137
down the john
in his cell.

28:58.170 --> 29:00.139
Techs checked it out, said
it's an encryption device.

29:00.172 --> 29:01.173
David's got
them going back

29:01.207 --> 29:02.474
through all his
online activity.

29:02.508 --> 29:03.475
Sounds good.

29:03.509 --> 29:06.412
What the hell's
going on, Eppes?

29:06.445 --> 29:07.413
Charlie raised
some questions.

29:07.446 --> 29:08.948
Yeah, so I hear.

29:08.981 --> 29:10.917
Some crackpot theory
that Glaser's being framed?

29:10.950 --> 29:12.184
Back off.

29:12.218 --> 29:14.220
It was your idea to bring him
in in the first place, right?

29:14.253 --> 29:15.988
Aronow's encryption
device was used to chat

29:16.022 --> 29:17.289
on a cooking Web site.

29:17.323 --> 29:18.825
Cooking?

29:18.858 --> 29:20.960
Conversations about ingredients
and baking times

29:20.993 --> 29:22.995
were really about
bomb-making.

29:23.029 --> 29:24.263
He spent most of
his time chatting

29:24.296 --> 29:26.065
with the username
"Burnrate20."

29:26.098 --> 29:28.234
They also mentioned
the RF59 signature.

29:28.267 --> 29:29.135
It's Glaser.

29:29.168 --> 29:31.337
No, I doubt it;
Aronow trashed Glaser

29:31.370 --> 29:34.140
for "disavowing violence
in the name of ideas."

29:34.173 --> 29:35.842
This guy,
this Burnrate20 offered him

29:35.875 --> 29:36.876
a chance to get even.

29:36.909 --> 29:38.477
Right, to frame Glaser.

29:38.510 --> 29:39.946
Can you trace Burnrate20?

29:39.979 --> 29:41.580
Guy knew how
to cover his tracks.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.816
Well, we know where Aronow is,
right?

29:44.917 --> 29:47.386
(wry chuckle)

29:47.419 --> 29:49.555
They're bringing him in
from work detail now.

29:49.588 --> 29:51.223
The kid got out early.

29:51.257 --> 29:53.125
Perfect timing.

29:53.159 --> 29:54.193
Aronow hasn't enjoyed
this much attention

29:54.226 --> 29:55.094
since he
first got here

29:55.127 --> 29:56.963
and the reporters
were buzzing around.

30:02.568 --> 30:05.204
Yeah, glad we can
brighten his day.

30:09.275 --> 30:11.077
What did our boy do
to get off work?

30:11.110 --> 30:12.011
He got sick.

30:12.044 --> 30:14.280
Prison doc thinks
he inhaled something.

30:14.313 --> 30:16.215
Like what?
Glue.

30:16.248 --> 30:18.084
He was doing some rebinding
in the library.

30:18.117 --> 30:19.886
Wait, I thought
you guys were supposed

30:19.919 --> 30:21.287
to keep him away
from the chemicals.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.155
Yeah, you getting the same
bad feeling I'm getting?

30:23.189 --> 30:24.190
Yeah. Call the Bomb Squad.

30:24.223 --> 30:25.191
Now!

30:25.224 --> 30:26.993
Open up!

30:30.196 --> 30:32.264
(alarm buzzing)

30:34.333 --> 30:35.935
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

30:35.968 --> 30:37.937
- You all right?
- Yeah.

30:44.376 --> 30:46.312
JESSICA: Aronow joins
our list of victims

30:46.345 --> 30:48.047
even if it was
by suicide bomb.

30:48.080 --> 30:50.316
Looks like he got ahold of
the right chemicals this time.

30:50.349 --> 30:52.885
Yeah, but I can't figure
why now?

30:52.919 --> 30:54.586
Maybe our bomber
had a hand in it.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.588
Glaser was in lockup,
so it wasn't him.

30:56.622 --> 30:58.524
I was wrong about Aronow, too.

30:58.557 --> 31:01.193
I guess he was the one behind
the bombings three years ago.

31:01.227 --> 31:02.995
Well, whoever's doing it
now went to a lot of trouble

31:03.029 --> 31:04.096
to pin it on Glaser.

31:04.130 --> 31:05.431
Maybe he has
some theories.

31:05.464 --> 31:08.400
It's not like he's going
to talk to us.

31:08.434 --> 31:10.236
Maybe he'll talk
to someone else.

31:16.275 --> 31:18.344
Dr. Glaser?

31:18.377 --> 31:20.112
Professor Eppes.

31:20.146 --> 31:23.015
Is this the FBI's idea
of catch and release?

31:23.049 --> 31:25.551
Stick another hook in the
fish, watch it struggle?

31:25.584 --> 31:28.420
They just wanted me
to talk to you.

31:28.454 --> 31:29.989
Shouldn't you be applying
your talents

31:30.022 --> 31:32.658
to higher pursuits than
gumshoeing for a pack of thugs?

31:32.691 --> 31:34.593
Go home,
Professor.

31:34.626 --> 31:36.963
I really respect your ideas,
you know?

31:36.996 --> 31:38.430
Except for one.

31:38.464 --> 31:39.999
I believe

31:40.032 --> 31:43.335
that humanism should be
about humanity.

31:43.369 --> 31:46.038
Finally, some candor.

31:46.072 --> 31:47.306
I totally get
what you're saying.

31:47.339 --> 31:49.441
The dangers
of genetic engineering,

31:49.475 --> 31:51.443
taking humanity apart...

31:51.477 --> 31:55.214
And reordering it with no regard
for long-term consequences.

31:55.247 --> 31:59.018
Yeah, I'm aware of
the risk-reward analyses, but...

32:00.752 --> 32:03.155
...but my mother...

32:03.189 --> 32:06.959
She died of a disease that this
technology could cure, so...

32:08.727 --> 32:12.631
Isn't saving lives
a humanist ideal?

32:15.501 --> 32:17.469
We need your help.

32:17.503 --> 32:19.171
(clears throat)

32:19.205 --> 32:21.373
Whoever's bombing these people
has targeted you, as well.

32:21.407 --> 32:24.443
We think you might have an idea
who it could be.

32:26.512 --> 32:28.314
I suggest you look
for the answer

32:28.347 --> 32:30.316
by looking at the victims.

32:30.349 --> 32:32.118
A paradigm shift.

32:32.151 --> 32:34.420
I'm not... I don't know
what you mean.

32:34.453 --> 32:36.455
You're the genius,
Professor.

32:36.488 --> 32:39.325
Figure it out.

32:42.661 --> 32:44.263
DAVID:
Your hunch was right.

32:44.296 --> 32:45.764
Jason Aronow's suicide
bomb didn't match anything

32:45.797 --> 32:47.266
on the prison's
inventory list.

32:47.299 --> 32:49.368
Well, our guy got
to him somehow, right?

32:49.401 --> 32:51.270
Why don't you just check
the visitors' logs?

32:51.303 --> 32:52.738
- Colby's already on it.
- All right, good.

32:52.771 --> 32:53.772
Don!

32:53.805 --> 32:55.207
What, you got something
on Glaser?

32:55.241 --> 32:56.608
You know, it took me a while

32:56.642 --> 32:59.078
to understand Glaser's allusion
to a paradigm shift.

32:59.111 --> 33:01.480
We've all been looking at
the victims in this case

33:01.513 --> 33:02.681
as Glaser's enemies,

33:02.714 --> 33:04.716
when in fact,
they were his allies.

33:04.750 --> 33:06.118
Allies?

33:06.152 --> 33:07.419
Yeah, I-I've taken

33:07.453 --> 33:09.755
a fresh look at this case
in legal terms.

33:09.788 --> 33:12.291
Victim number one,
uh, uh, John Walton,

33:12.324 --> 33:15.527
was the first reporter
to out Glaser as a suspect

33:15.561 --> 33:17.263
by name.
All right. So?

33:17.296 --> 33:19.398
So, that information was leaked
to Walton

33:19.431 --> 33:21.167
by someone on the case,

33:21.200 --> 33:22.801
which caused evidence
to be thrown out.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.570
What about the
second victim, Tobin?

33:24.603 --> 33:26.538
Tobin. Well, after
he pointed his finger at Glaser,

33:26.572 --> 33:28.274
news surfaced
that he'd made a book deal,

33:28.307 --> 33:29.641
and the judge threw out
his testimony.

33:29.675 --> 33:30.809
DON:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:30.842 --> 33:32.678
And a bomb was sent
to that judge, too.

33:32.711 --> 33:34.413
Okay, so, so the bomber's
killing people

33:34.446 --> 33:36.415
that he holds responsible
for Glaser escaping justice.

33:36.448 --> 33:37.483
DON:
So a survivor

33:37.516 --> 33:40.419
of one of the victims, right?
Family, friend...

33:40.452 --> 33:42.088
Try a member of
law enforcement.

33:42.121 --> 33:44.056
Prison visitors' log shows

33:44.090 --> 33:45.757
Aronow had one
visitor yesterday.

33:45.791 --> 33:46.858
Who's that?

33:50.729 --> 33:52.531
DON: I say you led us
from the start.

33:52.564 --> 33:53.732
You wanted to nail
Glaser, right?

33:53.765 --> 33:55.601
I mean, you were
dying to do it.

33:55.634 --> 33:57.103
Damn straight.
I thought he was guilty.

33:57.136 --> 33:58.470
It was all a
setup, wasn't it?

33:58.504 --> 34:00.539
I mean, even bringing in
Charlie from the get-go.

34:00.572 --> 34:02.274
I called your brother
to get answers.

34:02.308 --> 34:03.475
What were you doing
at the prison yesterday?

34:03.509 --> 34:04.543
My job.

34:04.576 --> 34:06.512
Oh, yeah? What's that,
executing criminals, huh?

34:06.545 --> 34:07.613
Killing someone
for tanking your case?

34:07.646 --> 34:09.515
You don't know what the hell
you are talking about.

34:09.548 --> 34:10.582
You tell me what
I don't know.

34:10.616 --> 34:11.783
I will tell you.

34:11.817 --> 34:14.586
I went to go and see Aronow
because I wanted the truth.

34:14.620 --> 34:16.555
I was tired of all this
damn screwing around.

34:17.656 --> 34:19.091
The only person I blame

34:19.125 --> 34:20.726
for blowing the case
against Glaser is me.

34:20.759 --> 34:22.561
I'm the one who
leaked his name.

34:22.594 --> 34:24.330
Come on.

34:24.363 --> 34:26.365
You don't believe me, go-go
check the case files.

34:26.398 --> 34:28.500
My confidential reprimand
is in there.

34:28.534 --> 34:31.137
I am a cop, Eppes,
not a murderer.

34:31.170 --> 34:32.471
You know what?
You're off the case...

34:32.504 --> 34:34.072
Yeah, well, whatever.

34:37.276 --> 34:38.610
So Malloy took a
two-month suspension

34:38.644 --> 34:41.380
for leaking Glaser's name
to Walton's newspaper.

34:41.413 --> 34:42.648
Hey, Liz.

34:42.681 --> 34:44.883
But the prison surveillance
tapes show no sign

34:44.916 --> 34:46.685
that she passed
anything to Aronow.

34:46.718 --> 34:48.554
Right. Well, I mean,
somebody did.

34:48.587 --> 34:50.522
- And I think I know who.
- Yeah?

34:50.556 --> 34:51.590
And I got to thinking

34:51.623 --> 34:53.725
maybe our guy wasn't
on the prison visitors' log,

34:53.759 --> 34:55.394
'cause he's already inside,

34:55.427 --> 34:58.464
so I ran background checks
on the prison personnel.

34:58.497 --> 35:01.133
COLBY: That's the guard on
Aronow's cellblock.

35:01.167 --> 35:03.335
Lee Kettrick, former San
Francisco Bomb Squad.

35:03.369 --> 35:04.603
In Bill Regan's unit.

35:04.636 --> 35:06.672
Regan was the guy killed
defusing Aronow's

35:06.705 --> 35:07.673
last letter bomb.

35:07.706 --> 35:08.607
LIZ:
Kettrick wasn't there,

35:08.640 --> 35:11.577
but he watched
his buddy blown up on TV.

35:11.610 --> 35:13.612
He quit the force last year--
issues with depression.

35:13.645 --> 35:14.513
Gets a new job.

35:14.546 --> 35:16.682
And like Malloy,
thinks Glaser is part

35:16.715 --> 35:17.783
of the DNA Bomber conspiracy.

35:17.816 --> 35:19.151
And had a list of people

35:19.185 --> 35:20.552
he blamed
for letting him go free.

35:20.586 --> 35:22.488
Kills them,
makes it look like Glaser.

35:22.521 --> 35:24.356
And then kills Aronow
as final payback.

35:24.390 --> 35:25.724
So, where's this guy now?

35:35.334 --> 35:36.735
DAVID:
FBI! Don't move!

35:37.736 --> 35:39.838
Down on your knees.

35:39.871 --> 35:41.573
Let's go.

35:43.842 --> 35:45.477
Put your hands
behind your head.

35:45.511 --> 35:47.479
DAVID: We have you on tape,
Kettrick,

35:47.513 --> 35:49.615
slipping bomb materials
to Jason Aronow.

35:49.648 --> 35:52.484
Given what I wanted to do
to him, the kid got off easy.

35:52.518 --> 35:53.619
And what about the others?

35:53.652 --> 35:55.387
Glaser should have gone
to prison.

35:55.421 --> 35:56.855
It's their fault he didn't.

35:56.888 --> 35:58.890
Even if he didn't build
those bombs,

35:58.924 --> 36:01.727
he gave that kid the idea.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.729
It's all over
now, Kettrick.

36:03.762 --> 36:04.963
That's what you think.

36:04.996 --> 36:06.732
(laughs)

36:09.701 --> 36:11.670
(car remote chirps)

36:23.949 --> 36:25.083
So, Kettrick's
in custody,

36:25.116 --> 36:27.453
but David and Colby think
he's chosen his next victim.

36:27.486 --> 36:28.454
Fuse is already lit.

36:28.487 --> 36:29.988
Well, we've identified
the potential targets.

36:30.021 --> 36:31.690
And we're screening
their mail.

36:31.723 --> 36:33.592
Wait, what if he's
not using the mail?

36:33.625 --> 36:35.627
I mean, he already
played us once, right?

36:35.661 --> 36:36.728
Oh, it's the courthouse.

36:36.762 --> 36:37.996
Yeah, what about it?

36:38.029 --> 36:39.698
He wanted those
files to know

36:39.731 --> 36:40.766
who screwed up
Glaser's conviction.

36:40.799 --> 36:42.568
Oh, my God. It's Malloy.

36:45.571 --> 36:48.340
(car remote chirps,
car door bell dings)

36:52.711 --> 36:54.380
(sighs)

36:54.413 --> 36:56.282
(dings)

36:56.315 --> 36:58.884
(phone ringing)

36:58.917 --> 37:00.619
(sighs)

37:00.652 --> 37:01.920
Malloy.

37:01.953 --> 37:03.289
It's Eppes.
Where are you?

37:03.322 --> 37:04.423
My car.

37:04.456 --> 37:05.557
I'm vacating the premises.

37:05.591 --> 37:06.758
Those were your orders,
right?

37:06.792 --> 37:08.627
Listen to me.
Get out of the car.

37:08.660 --> 37:10.662
You're the next target.

37:10.696 --> 37:11.930
(rhythmic beeping)

37:11.963 --> 37:13.765
Your timing could have
been better, Eppes.

37:13.799 --> 37:14.900
(beeping)

37:14.933 --> 37:18.337
I'm sitting on the bomb
right now, and I got 19 minutes.

37:18.370 --> 37:19.571
Well, don't move, Jessica.

37:19.605 --> 37:21.973
If Kettrick used another one
of Glaser's military designs,

37:22.007 --> 37:23.975
there's probably
a pressure-switch in the seat.

37:24.009 --> 37:25.210
All right.

37:25.243 --> 37:26.878
DON: All right, just hang tight,
okay? You keep that line open.

37:26.912 --> 37:28.314
We're going
to get you out of there.

37:28.347 --> 37:29.648
It's going to take
at least half an hour

37:29.681 --> 37:30.849
to get the Bomb Squad to roll.

37:30.882 --> 37:32.284
All right, look,
we got to find

37:32.318 --> 37:33.919
another way then,
all right?

37:33.952 --> 37:35.387
Think I see it.

37:35.421 --> 37:36.955
Hey, I need
to talk to you.

37:36.988 --> 37:37.989
I'm busy,
Professor.

37:38.023 --> 37:39.658
Retrieving what your
FBI friends took from me.

37:39.691 --> 37:41.059
I need your help.

37:41.092 --> 37:42.394
I gave it to you, remember?

37:42.428 --> 37:43.695
There's a bomb, all right?

37:43.729 --> 37:44.663
It's likely your design.

37:44.696 --> 37:45.964
Malloy's the target.

37:45.997 --> 37:48.667
I know your history,
but you're her only hope.

37:48.700 --> 37:50.569
Personal animus aside,
sounds like a job

37:50.602 --> 37:51.837
for the Bomb Squad, not me.

37:51.870 --> 37:52.704
There's no time.

37:52.738 --> 37:53.872
I'm sorry.

37:53.905 --> 37:55.607
I can't help you.

37:55.641 --> 37:56.608
Glaser!

37:58.744 --> 38:00.078
I know what RF59 means.

38:00.111 --> 38:01.647
It's Richard Feynman's
1959 lecture

38:01.680 --> 38:03.482
on nanotechnology,
the future, right?

38:03.515 --> 38:04.650
I applaud your insight,

38:04.683 --> 38:06.618
but I'm not sure
I see your point.

38:06.652 --> 38:07.619
Feynman loved ideas,

38:07.653 --> 38:09.688
but he would never have used
incendiary words

38:09.721 --> 38:11.022
without regards
for consequences.

38:11.056 --> 38:12.758
Would have never walked away

38:12.791 --> 38:14.326
from someone
who needed his help.

38:14.360 --> 38:16.495
You were his student!

38:16.528 --> 38:17.763
What happened?

38:21.733 --> 38:23.835
(siren wailing)

38:23.869 --> 38:25.804
(tires screeching)

38:25.837 --> 38:27.639
All right, I got
the WIFI tap.

38:27.673 --> 38:29.908
I'm hacking into
the onboard computer right now.

38:29.941 --> 38:31.843
DON: All right, Jess,
how you doing there?

38:31.877 --> 38:34.346
I was doing fine, till I got
a look at your rescue team.

38:34.380 --> 38:36.682
He's here to help. You just got
to trust me, relax.

38:36.715 --> 38:38.417
(indistinct radio transmission)

38:38.450 --> 38:39.851
What do you say, pal?

38:39.885 --> 38:41.820
We're way past
letter bombs.

38:41.853 --> 38:43.755
It's one of my
designs, looks like.

38:43.789 --> 38:45.123
Thing's got enough C4

38:45.156 --> 38:46.758
to blow her into
the upper deck.

38:46.792 --> 38:48.827
So what, are you saying
you can disarm it or not?

38:48.860 --> 38:51.397
I can take care
of the pressure switch.

38:51.430 --> 38:53.865
Activating the airbag
will disable the sensor.

38:53.899 --> 38:55.634
Bomb's timer
is another matter.

38:55.667 --> 38:57.836
We stop the clock,
it'll go off.

38:57.869 --> 38:59.505
What if we fool
it instead?

38:59.538 --> 39:00.472
But how?

39:00.506 --> 39:03.975
If we reset the clock,
so that the bomb thinks

39:04.009 --> 39:05.444
it's already detonated,

39:05.477 --> 39:07.746
then the computer will
look for instructions

39:07.779 --> 39:09.415
in the code, and find none.

39:09.448 --> 39:11.383
Terminating itself
and crashing.

39:11.417 --> 39:13.785
to override the GPS feed.t need

39:13.819 --> 39:16.422
- Guys, we got a minute here.
- I'm on it!

39:16.455 --> 39:18.790
What about blowing the airbag,
deactivating the seat sensor?

39:18.824 --> 39:19.891
We can sequence it in.

39:19.925 --> 39:21.059
CHARLIE:
Just did that.

39:21.092 --> 39:22.227
DON:
Yeah, that'll work?

39:22.260 --> 39:25.397
In theory. Airbag will blow
before the timer override.

39:25.431 --> 39:28.099
She'll have two, maybe three
seconds to get out of the car.

39:28.133 --> 39:29.868
All right, I'm going
to go help her.

39:29.901 --> 39:31.036
- What?
- Now, wait. Don, Don! Just...

39:31.069 --> 39:32.704
Just disarm it,
all right? I got it.

39:32.738 --> 39:33.705
- What are you doing, Eppes?
- Just relax. Quiet.

39:33.739 --> 39:35.707
- Get out of here!
- All right, listen to me.

39:35.741 --> 39:37.609
- Eppes come on, get outta here.
- Listen to me. Just relax.

39:37.643 --> 39:38.977
Charlie thinks he
can disarm it, okay?

39:39.010 --> 39:40.579
So I'm going to
need you to jump.

39:40.612 --> 39:41.813
I'm gonna help you out. Okay,
you with me?

39:41.847 --> 39:42.814
All right. Yeah, I'm with you.

39:42.848 --> 39:44.182
All right, Charlie.

39:44.215 --> 39:45.917
I'm programming in the time
right now. Just hang on.

39:45.951 --> 39:47.185
(trilling)

39:47.218 --> 39:48.720
Here we go. You ready?

39:48.754 --> 39:49.888
All right, stand by!

39:51.056 --> 39:52.424
Okay.

39:52.458 --> 39:54.092
(trilling)

39:54.125 --> 39:55.894
- Now!
- Go, go!

39:55.927 --> 39:57.929
(screaming)

39:57.963 --> 39:59.197
Stay back, stay back!

39:59.230 --> 40:00.466
(trilling)

40:00.499 --> 40:01.500
(beep)

40:01.533 --> 40:02.167
It didn't detonate.

40:03.101 --> 40:03.735
Bomb's disarmed.

40:03.769 --> 40:05.937
Congratulations,
Professors.

40:05.971 --> 40:06.938
- You all right?
- You all right?

40:06.972 --> 40:07.873
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:07.906 --> 40:08.807
Two arms, two legs,
I'm-I'm good, yeah.

40:08.840 --> 40:10.809
DON: Okay, just take a...
take a second.

40:10.842 --> 40:11.910
(panting)

40:13.011 --> 40:15.914
How can I ever begin to...?

40:15.947 --> 40:17.816
You can't.

40:17.849 --> 40:21.052
Uh, Professor Glaser?

40:21.086 --> 40:23.054
I'm out of favors.

40:23.088 --> 40:26.525
Well, look, if you ever feel
like sitting in on a class,

40:26.558 --> 40:29.795
I would be delighted
to invite you to guest-lecture.

40:32.531 --> 40:34.466
I'll give it some thought.

40:39.104 --> 40:40.839
MILLIE: Ooh!
- Hey!

40:40.872 --> 40:42.608
You're good
at that, huh? Ooh...

40:42.641 --> 40:43.809
To excess.

40:43.842 --> 40:45.477
But not to excess, huh?
(laughs)

40:45.511 --> 40:47.178
Sounds like
Shakespeare.

40:47.212 --> 40:49.014
Yeah. Oh, hail

40:49.047 --> 40:50.181
the conquering hero!

40:50.215 --> 40:51.950
How about
some champagne?

40:51.983 --> 40:53.051
Uh, uh, champagne?
Sure.

40:53.084 --> 40:55.921
Wait. Does that mean that
one of you won the bet?

40:55.954 --> 40:57.222
ALAN: We decided that
anti-consumerism

40:57.255 --> 40:58.824
is too all-consuming.

40:58.857 --> 40:59.725
Mm-hmm.

40:59.758 --> 41:02.060
So, our new credo
is, uh, moderation.

41:02.093 --> 41:04.029
- All things...
- In moderation.

41:04.062 --> 41:05.531
- That's sweet.
- His idea.

41:05.564 --> 41:06.798
DON: Hey.

41:06.832 --> 41:08.199
- Oh, Don.
- Hello.

41:08.233 --> 41:09.801
What's going on,
champagne?

41:09.835 --> 41:11.169
All I ever get is beer.

41:11.202 --> 41:13.204
Yeah, well, we can
change that right now.

41:13.238 --> 41:14.706
There you are, my boy.

41:14.740 --> 41:16.007
All right, well,

41:16.041 --> 41:17.075
to Charlie, who, uh,

41:17.108 --> 41:19.244
seriously pulled a rabbit
out of his hat today.

41:19.277 --> 41:20.946
Wow, well...

41:20.979 --> 41:22.180
Oh, sounds like
you have restored

41:22.213 --> 41:23.615
your faith in your brother.

41:23.649 --> 41:25.250
Whoa. When did I ever lose it?

41:25.283 --> 41:26.885
Uh, I think
I've lost count.

41:26.918 --> 41:28.787
Oh, come on, bro,
I'd put my life

41:28.820 --> 41:30.255
in your hands
any day of the week.

41:30.288 --> 41:31.857
Well, that's great,

41:31.890 --> 41:33.959
because Millie and I are
now going to dinner.

41:33.992 --> 41:35.527
I will leave you
with your brother.

41:35.561 --> 41:36.294
Bon appГ©tit.

41:36.327 --> 41:37.729
He will be your
designated chef.

41:37.763 --> 41:39.030
No, I'm going
skating. See you.

41:39.064 --> 41:40.065
Hungarian goulash.

41:40.098 --> 41:41.232
Going skating.

41:41.266 --> 41:42.934
I'm preparing
a nice goulash.

41:42.968 --> 41:43.769
Where's
everybody...?

41:43.802 --> 41:47.973
Well, I guess it's
goulash for two.
