out and supporting the band tonight.

00:11.970 --> 00:13.926
They're really excited to be here.

00:14.098 --> 00:17.636
Thank you, Metropolis,
for spreading the word about our concert.

00:17.810 --> 00:23.100
All right, the band will be up real soon,
so sit tight and get ready for a great show.

00:28.696 --> 00:32.109

like this together.

How about I reintroduce you
to your favorite bewy?

Hey.

01:07.860 --> 01:10.943
The promoter needs some gum
and I'm fresh out. You got any?

01:11.572 --> 01:13.904
Look around, Einstein.
We're in a gum factory.

03:40.679 --> 03:42.385
Hey, what happened?

03:53.025 --> 03:54.606
Thanks.

05:18.318 --> 05:22.778
Well, at least Kara didn't forget
how to use up all the hot water.

05:23.991 --> 05:26.573
Yeah, but I understand...

05:26.743 --> 05:29.951
...that she still hasn't managed
to recover her memory.

05:33.208 --> 05:35.790
She still thinks she's from Minnesota.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.586
But I think the more she looks
into her past...

05:39.756 --> 05:42.088
...she'll realize it's all a lie.

05:42.634 --> 05:43.965
Uh....

05:45.012 --> 05:48.596
Do you think if she was, uh,
taken to the Fortress...

05:48.765 --> 05:50.426
...it might speed up the process?

05:50.600 --> 05:54.843
Last time I went to Jor-El for advice,
he kept me prisoner in the Fortress.

05:55.522 --> 05:59.435
-I think it's time to tell her the truth.
-She won't believe you.

06:00.569 --> 06:03.686
-C|ark, we have to protect her.
-I agree.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.776
Especially when she's been visiting...

06:07.534 --> 06:09.399
...with Lex.

06:13.290 --> 06:16.157
As much as I hate to admit it,
it makes sense.

06:16.334 --> 06:18.199
He found her. She trusts him.

06:22.507 --> 06:24.372
Her bracelet.

06:24.843 --> 06:26.458
That connects her to Krypton.

06:26.720 --> 06:27.755
Yes, but...

06:28.638 --> 06:30.765
...I thought it had gone missing.

06:30.932 --> 06:32.888
It has, but there's gotta be some way
to ﬁnd it.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.346
Mm. Oh.

06:35.520 --> 06:39.183
In the meantime,
I suggest you keep a sharp eye...

-Oh, my God. Pete.
-Hey.

06:51.036 --> 06:52.367
Oh....

06:52.537 --> 06:54.323
Pete, it's good to see you.

06:54.498 --> 06:55.829
What are you doing here?

06:55.999 --> 06:58.115
More importantly, what's he doing here?

07:03.173 --> 07:05.585
I guess more has changed around here
than I thought.

It's a long story.

07:41.378 --> 07:45.291
I take it the fresh farm air isn't
as invigorating as it's cracked up to be?

wandering around that place...

07:51.054 --> 07:53.511
...trying to ﬁnd something
that will jog my memory.

07:54.266 --> 07:55.551
Well?

Did anything stand out?

07:57.561 --> 07:59.643
Anything out of the ordinary?

08:00.772 --> 08:02.387
Actually, yeah.

08:02.566 --> 08:04.306
Everything.

08:05.402 --> 08:07.984
I don't feel connected to it at all.

08:09.239 --> 08:11.355
But thanks for ﬁnding what you did.

08:11.533 --> 08:15.071
I know it matches with the girl
formerly known as Kara Kent...

08:15.996 --> 08:17.861
...but the girl in that folder isn't me.

08:22.043 --> 08:24.250
How well do you know Clark?

08:25.255 --> 08:27.086
Do you trust him?

08:29.509 --> 08:31.966
I wish I could say yes.

08:35.682 --> 08:39.015
I'm starting to wonder
if he's hiding something from me.

08:39.186 --> 08:42.770
Doesn't it seem weird that I don't have
any medical or dental records?

08:42.939 --> 08:44.770
Who doesn't get sick?

08:45.734 --> 08:47.395
Clark can be evasive.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.439
Why would he lie to me?

08:50.614 --> 08:52.479
What in my past could be so horrible...

08:52.657 --> 08:55.034
-...he wouldn't want me to know about it?
-Kara...

08:55.202 --> 08:57.033
...I promise you...

08:57.204 --> 09:00.992
...I will do everything in my power
to help you get your memory back.

09:04.044 --> 09:08.037
Now, I don't suppose Clark has mentioned
anything about your missing bracelet.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.671
No.

09:11.509 --> 09:13.124
Then I guess I should tell you.

09:18.475 --> 09:21.592
The design on your bracelet is a symbol.

09:21.978 --> 09:25.721
A symbol that matches others
that have appeared around Smallville.

09:27.359 --> 09:31.272
These were ﬁrst seen as paintings
in the Kiwatche caves...

09:31.446 --> 09:34.233
...but they've appeared
much more recently...

09:34.741 --> 09:37.107
...bumed into the Kent barn.

09:38.995 --> 09:41.611
Whatever Clark's hiding from you...

09:41.790 --> 09:44.998
...I think it has something to do
with these symbols.

09:48.004 --> 09:51.337
That bracelet could be the clue
to uncovering your true identity.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.226
All right, I'll see you this afternoon.

10:05.814 --> 10:07.350
You don't want me to go with you?

10:07.524 --> 10:10.311
No, it's okay.
Ben will help me unload the posts.

So the secret of the century
is not so secret anymore.

all know the truth...

10:36.344 --> 10:39.882
-...about your extraterrestrial crash landing?
-It all just kind of happened.

10:42.100 --> 10:45.968
Well, the truth is, with all the danger
I put you in knowing my secret...

10:46.146 --> 10:48.228

10:48.398 --> 10:49.888

Lionel's done a lot for me and my mom.

11:19.763 --> 11:21.594
Oh, sure he has.

11:21.765 --> 11:24.928
I mean, he's done a lot for my family too.

11:25.185 --> 11:28.598
Took our factory,
caused my parents' divorce...

11:28.772 --> 11:30.603
...the guy's a real saint.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.192
That's the way it used to be.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.228
Can't expect you to understand,
I mean...

11:38.406 --> 11:42.570
...you have been gone for over three years.
What have you been doing?

11:44.746 --> 11:47.613
We don't all land our dream career
like Chloe.

11:47.791 --> 11:51.283
Kind of been doing the roadie gig.
Pays the bills.

11:52.087 --> 11:54.544
Could at least have returned
one of my calls.

11:56.466 --> 11:59.299
Think it's easy saying goodbye
to your best friend?

11:59.969 --> 12:03.962
I couldn't risk anyone using me
to get to the truth about your secret.

12:04.516 --> 12:07.508
I ﬁgured it was better
just leaving it all in the past.

12:10.105 --> 12:12.312
-I didn't ask you to do that, Pete.
-I know.

12:13.191 --> 12:17.025
But it doesn't change the fact that I've
been looking over my shoulder ever since.

12:18.321 --> 12:22.655
I mean, I had to leave my life behind
because of you, Clark.

12:23.952 --> 12:25.817
And to be honest...

12:26.162 --> 12:28.619
...it was better than living
in your shadow.

12:31.501 --> 12:33.116
I didn't know.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.493
Luckily, everything's changed.

12:41.010 --> 12:43.171
Whoo! Ha-ha.

12:43.346 --> 12:46.338
I ﬁnally brought my game up
to your level, Clark.

12:46.599 --> 12:47.850
What happened to you?

12:48.017 --> 12:49.177
It doesn't matter.

12:49.352 --> 12:51.138
The other night, I saved this girl...

12:51.312 --> 12:54.304
...and I ﬁnally got a taste
of what it felt like to be you.

12:54.482 --> 12:55.597
To be a hero.

13:00.530 --> 13:02.987
Whatever it is,
we need to ﬁnd a way to reverse it.

13:04.701 --> 13:06.862
I should've known
you couldn't be happy for me.

13:10.039 --> 13:11.370
I want you to be careful.

13:11.541 --> 13:13.953
And what? Hide like you?

13:14.127 --> 13:17.039

is how many people's lives...

13:21.843 --> 13:24.255
...you're gonna ruin
by keeping your powers a secret.

13:24.429 --> 13:27.637
I'm not gonna make anyone
live with that burden like you did.

-This guy is Pete Ross.

He was, like, my best friend in high school.
Like, back before Clark.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.702
You, um, ditched him for Clark?

14:42.715 --> 14:43.750
No.

I mean, we were all friends.
We were all best friends.

-Yeah.

...of the meteor-enhanced.
He's smart, he's funny...

15:14.330 --> 15:17.914
...the guy's story is beyond amazing,
it's great.

15:19.168 --> 15:23.036
Okay, so he's a walking personal ad,
but, Jimmy, as much as I appreciate...

15:23.214 --> 15:26.923
...your socially conscious attitude
adjustment, the press would turn Pete...

15:27.093 --> 15:29.459
-...into a circus freak.
-lt's just an interview.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.388

prose just to smooth out the rough edges?

Sprinkle some of your Hemingway dust.

16:44.170 --> 16:48.334
IT told me you've been monitoring
everything on the Daily Planet computers?

16:50.677 --> 16:52.838
Unauthorized surveillance
is totally unethical.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.503
Pretty big words from a cub reporter.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.469
Shouldn't you be using them
to write stories?

16:58.643 --> 17:02.386
Good idea. I think ofﬁce espionage
has a nice ring to it.

17:02.980 --> 17:04.265

17:04.440 --> 17:09.184
...l'm new here, but I thought Lois
had ﬁrst stab at conspiracy theories.

You don't wanna think that one of your
best friends could be a meteor freak?

18:07.670 --> 18:10.377
I hate to think that you have something
against the meteor-enhanced.

18:10.548 --> 18:13.415
That's not it. I just don't wanna see
anything happen to Pete.

18:13.593 --> 18:17.677
Like what? Get the credit he deserves?
Pete Ross is a hero, he saved Kara's life...

18:17.847 --> 18:21.965
...and having the courage to reveal that
to the rest of the world, that's a big deal.

18:23.311 --> 18:26.053
I'm not sure the rest of the world
is gonna see it that way.

18:26.230 --> 18:30.098
Why? The world needs a hero now
more than ever, Clark.

18:33.780 --> 18:37.238

without being afraid.

some things always remain the same.

I couldn't agree more.

19:43.683 --> 19:49.269
I'm actually in the process of mopping up
Lex Luthor's daily carnage as we speak.

19:49.438 --> 19:51.269
Now, there's a name I don't miss.

19:51.440 --> 19:54.773
He's playing Big Brother
on all of the computers at the Daily Planet.

19:54.944 --> 19:57.651
All my work
is under his cyber lock and key.

19:57.822 --> 20:01.155
Well, can't you just work some of your
virtual voodoo and get him back?

20:01.325 --> 20:05.113
Short of a direct hit
from a massive virus...

20:05.288 --> 20:09.122
...all of these ﬁles will forever be
in the clutches of Citizen Lex.

20:12.128 --> 20:14.995

to focus on.

because of his secret too.

This isn't about Clark.

...and right now, you actually could reach
a few of those stars...

all the meteor-infected people...

appreciate you going through his things.

What do you know about these symbols?

22:23.592 --> 22:27.585
As much as anyone in Smallville. I guess.
They're from a local Indian tribe.

22:27.763 --> 22:30.630
Then why were they on the bracelet
I used to wear?

22:31.809 --> 22:34.642
Maybe you bought it
while you were here visiting the Kents...

22:34.812 --> 22:37.519

as a present.

who's still infatuated with Clark Kent.

one truth remains:

26:08.692 --> 26:10.853
...and if you really wanna be her hero...

26:15.824 --> 26:21.444

that I believe is locked in my father's vault.

38:04.366 --> 38:06.072
Yeah, that's cool.

38:08.161 --> 38:11.369
What about you?
How was date night with Kara?

38:11.539 --> 38:12.995
Ah, you know.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.865
You know, Kara's great...

38:19.005 --> 38:21.963
...but I think the spark
kind of ﬁzzled for both of us.

38:24.260 --> 38:25.716
Sorry.

38:27.305 --> 38:28.511
No, you're not.

38:29.933 --> 38:34.051
No, no. Uh.... What I meant was that
I hope that you're not.

38:36.815 --> 38:39.557
I should've just said that I'm not, right?

38:47.117 --> 38:48.857
Is there any...

38:49.411 --> 38:53.575
...interest in seeing if we can breathe some
ﬁre into this ember over a cup of coffee?

38:56.584 --> 38:58.575
I'll bring the butane.

40:20.335 --> 40:21.996
Mr. Luthor...

40:22.170 --> 40:24.456
...I checked with
the Metropolis Observatory...

40:24.631 --> 40:26.997
...about the constellation
in your family crest.

40:27.175 --> 40:30.588
The last time these stars were conﬁgured
in this exact arrangement...

40:30.762 --> 40:33.003
...was October 7th, 1989.

40:35.100 --> 40:36.761
The day of the ﬁrst meteor shower.

40:38.394 --> 40:40.259
And there's something else.

40:54.744 --> 40:57.861
Sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you.

40:59.833 --> 41:02.370
I thought I made myself clear.

41:03.211 --> 41:05.873
You're always welcome here.

41:06.464 --> 41:08.671
I was hoping you'd say that.

41:10.051 --> 41:12.633
I don't trust Clark and Lana anymore...

41:13.638 --> 41:16.471
...and the idea of living with them
on the farm....

41:18.893 --> 41:22.511
Hope you don't mind, Lex,
but I was wondering if I could stay here.

41:22.939 --> 41:24.520
With you.
