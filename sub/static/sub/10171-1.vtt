00:31.765 --> 00:34.563
Come on, come on, come on.
All right, here we go.

00:47.580 --> 00:49.343
Take a seat, buddy!

00:51.317 --> 00:53.444
Come on.
It was a good play.

00:57.857 --> 00:59.051
Are you gonna be
like this all day?

00:59.125 --> 01:00.285
I don't know. Is it gonna
be like this all day?

01:00.360 --> 01:01.657
I don't know.
It's up to you.

01:01.728 --> 01:02.854
I have no room to sit.
I got no room to sit.

01:02.929 --> 01:03.918
I'm sitting next to
a guy who's sitting

01:03.997 --> 01:05.430
like he's at home on the
toilet with his legs spread.

01:05.498 --> 01:07.056
Please don't crowd people.
Relax, please. Look at me.

01:07.133 --> 01:08.498
I am relaxed.
Look how I'm sitting.

01:08.568 --> 01:10.729
Why are you sitting like that?
Because... What do you think?

01:10.804 --> 01:11.964
Why'd you wake me up
for this shit?

01:12.038 --> 01:13.767
Because I'm trying to relax
and have a nice day.

01:13.840 --> 01:16.240
Sweating in the sun
like a Tijuana whore.

01:16.342 --> 01:18.207
Ice-cold soda!

01:19.179 --> 01:20.908
Get your soda here!

01:23.483 --> 01:26.008
On the right. Coming down
there. Pass that on down there.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.418
Hey, hot dog guy, can I get
six hot dogs down here, please?

01:28.488 --> 01:30.012
Right away. And make it right, please.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.251
You know, with the mustard
and the ketchup and the relish.

01:32.325 --> 01:33.758
Don't make me
hit you up for more.

01:33.827 --> 01:35.624
I thought we were going
to Wiener Circle after this.

01:35.695 --> 01:38.129
We will. Then why are
you getting hot dogs?

01:38.198 --> 01:41.429
Pass this down, please.
You can keep the change.

01:42.202 --> 01:43.328
Do you want
one of the hot dogs?

01:43.403 --> 01:45.234
You can have a hot...
You want a hot dog?

01:45.305 --> 01:46.329
Do you want a hot dog, miss?

01:46.406 --> 01:47.634
No. Thank you.
You can have one.

01:47.707 --> 01:49.038
That's okay. Go ahead.
You can have a hot dog.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.098
No, I don't want one.
Excuse me, sir?

01:50.176 --> 01:51.541
Would you mind passing the
lady one of the hot dogs?

01:51.611 --> 01:52.669
I'm good, thanks.
You don't have to share.

01:52.745 --> 01:54.508
You can have your own. Thanks.
That's really nice of you.

01:54.581 --> 01:55.878
Just have one, please.
Okay, give me a hot dog.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.918
Somebody give her a hot dog. I got... The
big guy can't eat all of them. Have one.

01:58.985 --> 02:00.919
Have you ever had one before?
A hot dog?

02:00.987 --> 02:03.455
At the ballpark?
I have. I believe I have.

02:03.523 --> 02:04.581
Okay, good.
Thank you.

02:04.657 --> 02:06.488
Well, enjoy this one.
Thanks.

02:06.826 --> 02:08.657
Do you like mustard?
No, I'm okay.

02:08.728 --> 02:11.356
It's much better
with a topping. Here.

02:12.198 --> 02:14.359
I'm just kidding,
I'll give you two.

02:19.339 --> 02:20.966
Cheers!
Thanks.

02:21.941 --> 02:23.272
We'll share it.

02:24.077 --> 02:27.240
It's a good dog.
I like the hot dog. I know.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.206
That's nice.

02:29.282 --> 02:31.113
You have a problem with
me eating a hot dog, guy?

02:31.184 --> 02:32.776
I'm trying to watch the game
and have a hot dog.

02:32.852 --> 02:35.753
I'll smack him in his head.
No, just leave him alone.

02:51.304 --> 02:54.535
Hey, you want to go get a drink? No.

02:54.774 --> 02:56.435
I'm with somebody, sorry.

02:56.509 --> 02:58.773
Who? The guy with the
tucked-in shirt and the visor?

02:58.845 --> 03:01.643
What, is that like a brother? The
guy was not your brother, then.

03:01.714 --> 03:02.908
Who is this guy?
He's not my brother.

03:02.982 --> 03:04.973
Who's this... I'm getting mad
now. I'm jealous. Who is this guy?

03:05.051 --> 03:06.518
Who are you? I don't
know. I'm kidding with you.

03:06.586 --> 03:08.611
Who's the guy with the tucked-in
stuff? Is that a boyfriend?

03:08.688 --> 03:09.882
Uh, it's...

03:10.423 --> 03:12.254
I'm going. Do you
think you'll marry him?

03:12.325 --> 03:14.122
What? 'Cause I know
you've thought about it.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.685
The first time you laid eyes
on him, you probably thought,

03:16.763 --> 03:20.221
"I wonder if I could marry this guy in plaid
shorts who tucks his shirt in. No way. "

03:20.300 --> 03:21.927
Then when you kissed him,
you said, "I can't believe it.

03:22.001 --> 03:24.663
"I had a lot to drink tonight.
I'm kissing the tucked-in guy. "

03:24.737 --> 03:27.103
My point is, if you're not
gonna marry him... Yeah.

03:27.173 --> 03:28.333
...and if it's not forever,

03:28.408 --> 03:31.002
then you really don't have anything
to lose in taking me up on my offer.

03:31.077 --> 03:33.944
Uh-huh. Well, I'm gonna go.
Okay. Me, too.

03:34.013 --> 03:35.981
Okay. To where? On an
ice-breaking first date?

03:36.049 --> 03:37.778
Well, no, I don't think...
Listen.

03:37.850 --> 03:39.715
If you want to stay off
the market while you're with

03:39.786 --> 03:42.186
I'm-not-the-one- but-I'm-comfortable,
then you can do that.

03:42.255 --> 03:43.654
But for all you know,
I just offered you

03:43.723 --> 03:46.214
a get-out-of-bored-love- for-free
card with no strings attached.

03:46.292 --> 03:47.725
God, you're crazy.
No, I'm not crazy.

03:47.794 --> 03:49.625
And a lot of times people go,
"Oh, that's crazy,"

03:49.696 --> 03:51.027
and then they go,
"It's genius. "

03:51.097 --> 03:52.792
That's what happened
when the person invented fire.

03:52.865 --> 03:55.925
They burned that witch. And guess what,
then they got warm and they ate good stuff.

03:56.002 --> 03:57.833
Now, where are we headed to?
Let's not make this weird,

03:57.904 --> 03:59.303
'cause I'm not good on dates.
No. You know what?

03:59.372 --> 04:01.237
I'm better just to kind of hang
out and, if we don't have fun,

04:01.307 --> 04:02.296
I might go my separate way.
Okay.

04:02.375 --> 04:05.037
I'm not committing to anything. I'll
go hang out with you for a little bit.

04:05.111 --> 04:06.976
That's not gonna happen.
But I can't say for sure.

06:16.075 --> 06:19.044
<i>All right, all right, everybody.
Welcome to Three Brothers Bus Tours.</i>

06:19.112 --> 06:22.104
<i>I'm brother number two.
It's good to have you here.</i>

06:22.181 --> 06:24.240
<i>That's right, there's plenty
of seats here up front.</i>

06:24.317 --> 06:27.753
<i>I promise I won't bite. I'm not a
biter. I'm psyched to have you here.</i>

06:27.820 --> 06:31.278
<i>Okay, a couple quick ground rules.
Please don't jump off the bus.</i>

06:31.357 --> 06:32.688
<i>Weird. Not fun for anybody.</i>

06:32.759 --> 06:34.750
<i>Also, no throwing objects
at pedestrians,</i>

06:34.827 --> 06:36.692
<i>unless, of course,
they deserve it. Okay?</i>

06:36.763 --> 06:39.732
<i>We are not at work today.
We are on vacation today.</i>

06:39.799 --> 06:41.994
<i>And if you can't blow it
out here on the big funny bus,</i>

06:42.068 --> 06:43.626
<i>where the hell can you?</i>

06:43.703 --> 06:45.933
<i>I do split the tips
with my driver, Shondra.</i>

06:46.005 --> 06:47.597
<i>We don't want her back out
turning tricks.</i>

06:47.673 --> 06:51.074
<i>That was a weird time for
everyone. Seriously. Honest to God.</i>

06:51.144 --> 06:53.476
<i>And I was a customer.
Long time ago.</i>

06:53.546 --> 06:56.014
<i>Come on, everybody,
let's get loose!</i>

06:56.916 --> 06:59.282
<i>I'm gonna ask you once.
Show me that you mean it.</i>

06:59.352 --> 07:02.583
<i>Don't make me ask you twice.
Are you ready to see Chicago?</i>

07:02.688 --> 07:04.747
<i>Are you ready to see Chicago?</i>

07:04.824 --> 07:07.850
<i>That's what I'm talking about.
Shondra, put this baby in the air.</i>

07:07.927 --> 07:10.953
<i>Let's get the blood flowing. Let's
get everyone up and let's loosen it up.</i>

07:11.030 --> 07:12.429
<i>Coming up here,
you're gonna notice</i>

07:12.498 --> 07:15.524
<i>one of the only buildings
to survive the fire of 1871.</i>

07:15.601 --> 07:19.128
<i>That is the original Chicago
Water Tower and Pumping Station.</i>

07:20.373 --> 07:23.206
Happy Holidays.
Marilyn Dean Gallery.

07:23.709 --> 07:26.007
The artist was inspired
by the neoclassical movement.

07:26.078 --> 07:27.067
No, she doesn't.

07:27.146 --> 07:29.910
But wanted to reflect it
with an abstract bent.

07:29.982 --> 07:31.006
Okay, bye-bye.

07:31.083 --> 07:33.517
And how much is it?
$35,000.

07:33.653 --> 07:37.384
Happy Holidays. Marilyn
Dean Gallery. Hold, please.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.654
Will you excuse me for
a moment? Sure. Go ahead.

07:41.194 --> 07:42.320
Christopher?
Yes, sweetie.

07:42.395 --> 07:43.657
Hi, honey.
Hi.

07:44.430 --> 07:48.366
Christmas was months ago. Don't
remind me. I miss it so much.

07:49.068 --> 07:53.402
Yeah, I know.
But today is not a holiday.

07:53.506 --> 07:56.373
I know for a fact that people
like my spirit on the phone

07:56.442 --> 07:58.273
and they dig the energy
that I give them.

07:58.344 --> 08:02.212
Okay. I'm just saying, I don't think
Marilyn Dean will "dig" the energy.

08:02.281 --> 08:05.114
Oh, no. She's the one that
told me to be creative. So...

08:05.184 --> 08:07.744
I know. It's just... Okay.
What is the next holiday coming?

08:07.820 --> 08:09.310
The Fourth of July,
is that what's next?

08:09.388 --> 08:11.049
Well, if you want to get
technical, there's Memorial Day,

08:11.123 --> 08:13.148
there's Flag Day.

08:13.226 --> 08:15.990
Some people recognize Father's
Day as a holiday. I don't.

08:16.062 --> 08:20.624
I get it. I get it. Well, on those
days you can say, "Happy Holidays. "

08:20.700 --> 08:22.930
Every other day,
"Good morning, good afternoon,

08:23.002 --> 08:25.470
"good evening, Marilyn
Dean Gallery. " Okay?

08:27.039 --> 08:28.131
Okay.

08:30.276 --> 08:32.107
I'm so sorry about that.
Oh, no.

08:32.178 --> 08:35.875
So, now this is a new piece
by Zakrzewska.

08:35.948 --> 08:37.779
What do you think of this?

08:40.586 --> 08:42.611
Can I be honest with you?
Please.

08:43.054 --> 08:45.649
Other than taking an art
history class in college,

08:45.725 --> 08:49.559
which I pretty much slept through,
I don't have the first clue about art

08:49.629 --> 08:53.326
or how to go about buying it.
I mean, like that painting.

08:54.166 --> 08:58.398
I mean, I don't see the point in buying
something that I could have done myself.

08:59.138 --> 09:01.572
Yeah. I completely agree
with you.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.142
You know, an art teacher
of mine once said,

09:06.212 --> 09:09.704
"Never buy a piece of art
that you don't have to have. "

09:09.849 --> 09:13.250
You know, don't worry about who the
artist is or how much it's worth.

09:13.319 --> 09:17.221
I mean, you have to live with it every
day. You have to walk by it every day.

09:17.290 --> 09:20.817
You know, you have to really love
it. You have to really appreciate it.

09:20.893 --> 09:22.690
It's kind of like
picking a mate.

09:28.134 --> 09:29.761
Hey, honey!
Hi.

09:29.835 --> 09:31.769
How's it going?
It's good.

09:31.837 --> 09:34.101
Oh, wow. You got a
lot happening. I know.

09:34.173 --> 09:36.971
Very exciting.
I am starving.

09:37.043 --> 09:39.944
Oh, careful. That's really... That's
very hot. Oh, that's hot, hot, hot.

09:40.012 --> 09:41.570
Yep.
Jesus.

09:41.647 --> 09:44.741
Hey, honey, you've got to really...
You should get ready, okay?

09:44.817 --> 09:46.307
Oh, you look great.
Thank you.

09:46.385 --> 09:48.785
Got a lot of nice stuff.
Got a pizza.

09:48.955 --> 09:50.923
All kinds of stuff.
Terrific.

09:50.990 --> 09:54.721
I just need you to decide what
to... You know, I did everything.

10:02.268 --> 10:03.792
Gary?
Yeah?

10:04.303 --> 10:08.797
Oh, come on! Really?
You got three lemons.

10:09.008 --> 10:11.169
What my baby wants,
my baby gets. You know that.

10:11.243 --> 10:13.837
Yeah, but I wanted 12.
Baby wanted 12.

10:14.981 --> 10:17.176
Why would you want 12 lemons?

10:17.917 --> 10:20.078
Because I'm making
a 12-lemon centerpiece.

10:20.152 --> 10:23.178
So, no one's actually even eating
them? They're just show lemons?

10:23.255 --> 10:26.713
Yeah. They're just show lemons.
Shown in the center of the table.

10:26.792 --> 10:27.952
I'm glad you find that
amusing,

10:28.027 --> 10:30.222
but I cannot fill a vase
with only three lemons.

10:30.296 --> 10:32.764
Well, can't you just use,
like, maybe a drinking glass?

10:32.832 --> 10:33.924
I'm not gonna use
a drinking...

10:34.000 --> 10:35.661
We could have a smaller
version of a centerpiece.

10:35.735 --> 10:37.760
I'm not gonna use a drinking
glass for our centerpiece.

10:37.837 --> 10:38.895
You know what?
I've got an idea.

10:38.971 --> 10:42.168
Why don't we go ahead and scratch
the centerpiece idea altogether,

10:42.241 --> 10:44.106
because the chicken
that burnt my mouth

10:44.176 --> 10:46.076
could maybe use a little
bit of lemon on top of it.

10:46.145 --> 10:50.673
Guess what? Now we've made a better meal
versus something visually nice to look at.

10:52.451 --> 10:54.749
What are you do... What's
happening here? What are you doing?

10:54.820 --> 10:57.380
What are you doing? Oh, I had
such a long day on the bus.

10:57.456 --> 10:59.651
I need a little bit of down
time. My feet are killing me.

10:59.725 --> 11:01.659
Gary, come on, my feet are
killing me, too. I'm exhausted.

11:01.727 --> 11:03.695
I worked all day.
Went to the market.

11:03.763 --> 11:07.164
I cleaned this entire condo and then I've
been cooking for the last three hours.

11:07.233 --> 11:09.360
Come on. Help set the table.

11:09.969 --> 11:11.095
Sweetheart.
What?

11:11.170 --> 11:14.367
You've done such a great job already.
Don't you want to finish it yourself

11:14.440 --> 11:16.931
and have that personal power
of that accomplishment?

11:17.009 --> 11:18.874
Set the table.
Listen to me.

11:18.944 --> 11:22.141
Do you think that
when Michelangelo, right,

11:22.214 --> 11:24.774
was painting the Sixteenth
Chapel, that he said,

11:24.850 --> 11:27.580
"Hey, guys, you know, I did pretty
good on the first 15 chapels,

11:27.653 --> 11:29.780
"but why don't you help me
design this one?

11:29.855 --> 11:31.914
"And maybe you could
help me... Give me a brush

11:31.991 --> 11:35.119
"and you guys can grab brushes, and we
can all make a great chapel. " Uh-uh.

11:35.194 --> 11:38.391
No, he didn't. And you wanna
know what the results were?

11:38.464 --> 11:39.863
A masterpiece.

11:41.600 --> 11:45.661
Okay. It's the Sistine Chapel,
not the Sixteenth,

11:45.738 --> 11:50.334
and I bet when Michelangelo asked for
12 brushes, they didn't bring him three.

11:50.409 --> 11:52.969
Yeah. Okay, all the talking
is really starting to drain me,

11:53.045 --> 11:56.208
and now I'm gonna have to watch the
highlights later to see what I missed here.

11:56.282 --> 11:57.647
Honey, look, Gary, just...
Down time's important.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.685
Gary, please just take a shower,
okay? Down time's important.

11:59.752 --> 12:00.980
'Cause this is what
I don't want to have happen.

12:01.053 --> 12:04.250
I don't want the doorbell to ring.
I'm then forced to answer the door,

12:04.323 --> 12:06.291
entertain people,
and I'm still cooking dinner.

12:06.358 --> 12:07.450
Yeah.
Okay?

12:07.526 --> 12:11.462
You're absolutely right. Let's do that.
The second that this inning's over...

12:11.530 --> 12:13.054
Gary.
There's one out all ready.

12:13.132 --> 12:14.463
They're gonna be here
in 20 minutes.

12:14.533 --> 12:17.024
Baby, have you ever seen a shower
of mine take more than four minutes?

12:17.103 --> 12:18.127
Yes, I have. Come on.

12:18.204 --> 12:20.001
Oh, great!

12:20.506 --> 12:22.838
They're here. Okay. Table's
not set. Dinner's not ready.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.273
Would you please
just let my parents in?

12:24.343 --> 12:25.833
I gotta jump in the shower.
What?

12:25.911 --> 12:27.401
I gotta go.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.107
Gary. Gary.

12:35.654 --> 12:37.849
Well, seeing how our families
haven't had many opportunities

12:37.923 --> 12:42.485
to get to know one another, we figured,
what better way than to break some bread?

12:42.561 --> 12:45.894
So, everyone, thank you for
coming and enjoy the meal.

12:45.965 --> 12:48.365
Cheers.
Cheers, honey.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.202
Mrs. Grobowski. Nice
to meet you. Thank you.

12:51.270 --> 12:54.398
Cheer with the sons.
Sweetheart, cheers to you.

12:54.473 --> 12:58.204
Darling, I see that you put
those Feng Shui books

12:58.277 --> 13:00.472
that I sent to you
to good use.

13:00.546 --> 13:03.071
This place is so well
balanced. Thanks, Mom.

13:03.149 --> 13:05.140
Yeah, the energy in this place
is just amazing.

13:05.217 --> 13:06.275
Yes.

13:06.352 --> 13:09.048
Well, the energy in the condo
might be a little more amazing

13:09.121 --> 13:10.986
if we had a pool table.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.526
Gary, we've already
discussed that.

13:15.961 --> 13:18.395
We're gonna get a pool table
when we get a bigger place.

13:18.464 --> 13:20.659
The place is plenty big now, if
you wanted a pool table because...

13:20.733 --> 13:22.598
Gary. Yeah. You could
take the dining room table,

13:22.668 --> 13:23.828
go ahead and move her
in the living room.

13:23.903 --> 13:25.029
Really?
Plenty of room.

13:25.104 --> 13:27.902
And put a dining room table
in the living room? Okay.

13:27.973 --> 13:30.942
How do you... I mean, what do
you do with a dining room table?

13:31.010 --> 13:32.978
Eat on it. We'd have no
furniture in the living...

13:33.045 --> 13:34.603
Where's the furniture go?
All I'm saying is,

13:34.680 --> 13:36.170
it would be nice
to be able to shoot some pool.

13:36.248 --> 13:38.307
Well, this isn't a dorm. Look,
baby, I completely understand.

13:38.384 --> 13:39.874
There's halls and stuff.
I mean, you can go...

13:39.952 --> 13:42.580
We will wait and get a pool
table when we have a bigger place.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.020
Thank you.

13:48.694 --> 13:51.595
The food is outstanding.
It is delicious food.

13:51.664 --> 13:52.688
It's outstanding.

13:52.765 --> 13:54.630
Yeah, it really is nice.
Okay, everybody.

13:54.700 --> 13:57.726
Time for the joke of the day.
Knock, knock. Dad. Dad, come on.

13:57.803 --> 13:59.100
Who's there?
Norma Lee.

13:59.171 --> 14:00.331
Norma Lee, who?

14:00.406 --> 14:02.931
Normally, I don't go around
knocking on doors,

14:03.008 --> 14:06.739
but would you like to buy an
encyclopedia? I got a joke. I got a joke.

14:06.812 --> 14:09.042
How's it going?
I got a joke for you.

14:09.114 --> 14:12.845
What do you get when you cross
a gay Eskimo and a black guy?

14:13.686 --> 14:16.484
All right, look, I think we've had
enough with the jokes for tonight.

14:16.555 --> 14:18.853
Thank you, though. Let's
just talk with each other.

14:18.924 --> 14:19.982
All right.

14:20.059 --> 14:22.755
<i>I saw that Three Brothers
article in the Trib this week.</i>

14:22.828 --> 14:25.353
Sounds like you guys are up
to some pretty exciting stuff.

14:25.431 --> 14:30.368
Basically, our big goal is to try to
take Chicago tourism by air, land and sea.

14:30.436 --> 14:33.894
We're still in the ground
phase with the buses.

14:39.111 --> 14:42.080
But as soon as we get
our infantry established,

14:42.147 --> 14:45.514
then we'll take it to the squids. Yeah.

14:47.920 --> 14:50.150
Boats. Boats.
Oh, boats.

14:50.222 --> 14:53.350
As soon as we control the waterway,
then we'll bring in air supports

14:53.425 --> 14:56.292
and then we'll pretty much
control everything.

14:57.630 --> 14:59.291
You know, Dennis,

14:59.465 --> 15:03.196
the way your face lights up
when you describe your ambitions,

15:03.269 --> 15:05.134
it's really inspiring.

15:05.504 --> 15:09.270
Oh, thanks.
Because I understand

15:09.341 --> 15:12.174
how you feel that passion.

15:12.511 --> 15:15.912
And sharing it with other people,
I think that's what life's about.

15:15.981 --> 15:19.212
I don't feel that about
boats and squibs... Squids?

15:19.285 --> 15:20.445
Squids.
Sorry.

15:20.519 --> 15:23.920
Yeah. But I do feel it about singing.

15:27.159 --> 15:30.822
<i>With my a cappella group,
The Tone Rangers.</i>

15:33.632 --> 15:36.226
Although it's not
as aggressive as your dream,

15:36.302 --> 15:40.295
it's really more of a brotherhood.
It's like a musical team.

15:41.073 --> 15:44.270
It's like a symphony of guys.
Guy symphony.

15:44.710 --> 15:48.009
And it's very hard
to describe the true magic

15:48.480 --> 15:52.314
of a group of guys
singing in perfect harmony.

15:52.818 --> 15:54.479
It's transcendent.

15:54.887 --> 15:56.912
But it's still very real.

15:58.691 --> 16:02.024
I guess the best way
to put it in words is just...

16:17.743 --> 16:19.472
Even that doesn't do it.

16:19.545 --> 16:22.776
That doesn't do it because
that's just one person.

16:22.848 --> 16:26.079
And what I'm talking about is
the pulse of the collective.

16:26.418 --> 16:28.318
Oh, heck. Let me just
show you how it's done.

16:28.387 --> 16:29.979
Dad, how about
a little percussion?

16:30.055 --> 16:32.319
Tap-tap-tappy.
Tap-tap-tappy.

16:33.292 --> 16:34.554
And, Mom, high-hat.

16:36.428 --> 16:39.226
Good, Mom.
Excellent. And Gary!

16:39.331 --> 16:43.097
On the kick drum! Come, come!
On the kick drum! Come, come!

16:43.168 --> 16:46.001
That's Gary! Come, come
with the kick drum. Come!

16:46.071 --> 16:49.802
Come, come with the kick drum.
Gary, on the kick drum. Come, come.

16:49.875 --> 16:53.743
That's Gary on the kick drum.
Go! And Gary. In the house.

16:53.812 --> 16:54.904
Come, come.
I'm not with you.

16:54.980 --> 16:57.312
Come, come. With the
kick drum. Come, come.

16:57.383 --> 16:59.010
I'm just not really
the kick drum kind of guy.

16:59.084 --> 17:02.542
I'd rather be just a listener and enjoy
all the banging that he's doing and the...

17:02.621 --> 17:05.988
You know, Gary, that's your prerogative.
That's your right, to listen.

17:06.058 --> 17:08.424
Meantime, I've gotta talk
to Brooke about something.

17:08.493 --> 17:10.189
It's called the bass
line. Excuse me. Okay.

17:23.075 --> 17:24.337
Good, Carol.

17:25.109 --> 17:26.406
Good, Brooke.

17:29.415 --> 17:30.939
Yes, Dennis.

17:32.651 --> 17:34.516
Be nice.
Totally awesome.

17:38.157 --> 17:39.852
<i>Move yourself</i>

17:39.925 --> 17:41.825
<i>You always live your life</i>

17:41.960 --> 17:45.293
<i>Never thinking of the future</i>

17:45.364 --> 17:47.161
<i>Prove yourself</i>

17:47.232 --> 17:48.927
<i>You are the move you make</i>

17:49.001 --> 17:52.266
<i>Take your chances
win or loser</i>

17:52.337 --> 17:54.328
<i>See yourself</i>

17:54.606 --> 17:56.403
<i>You're every step you take</i>

17:56.475 --> 17:59.569
<i>You and you
and that's the only way</i>

17:59.645 --> 18:00.634
<i>Shake
Shake!</i>

18:00.712 --> 18:01.736
<i>Shake yourself</i>

18:01.814 --> 18:03.441
<i>You're every move you make</i>

18:03.515 --> 18:07.246
<i>So the story goes</i>

18:07.352 --> 18:08.614
Thank you so much.

18:08.687 --> 18:10.279
Okay, bye.
Thank you so much.

18:10.355 --> 18:11.947
It was great to see you. Okay. Come on.

18:12.024 --> 18:13.389
Have a good night.
It was really nice, Gary.

18:13.459 --> 18:15.484
Nice to see you. You, too.
Good to see you guys.

18:15.561 --> 18:16.892
Thanks, Brookie. Oh,
honey. Thank you, sweetie.

18:16.962 --> 18:19.556
You're still my
favorite singer. Stop it.

18:19.631 --> 18:23.692
Love you, sis. And I'd love for
you to come to a live performance

18:23.769 --> 18:27.034
of The Tone Rangers singing live.
That's something you'd really enjoy.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.130
It was good seeing you.
Okay.

18:28.207 --> 18:29.231
Thank you.
All right.

18:29.308 --> 18:31.572
Bye, darling. Thank you for
such a... Okay. Okay, Mom.

18:31.643 --> 18:33.634
We'll see you soon.
Bye, dear. Thanks, darling.

18:33.712 --> 18:35.009
See you later.
Okay, buddy.

18:35.080 --> 18:37.310
Oh, now, are you sure that
we can't help you clean up?

18:37.382 --> 18:39.407
No, no. I think we're gonna
be great. We'II... Yes?

18:39.485 --> 18:41.009
So nice of you to offer,
but we got it. Thank you.

18:41.086 --> 18:42.815
Oh, it was such fun.
Great.

18:42.888 --> 18:44.150
I love you.
Great to see you.

18:44.223 --> 18:45.622
Good night, sweetie.
Thank you so much.

18:45.691 --> 18:46.316
I appreciate it.
Thank you so much.

18:47.259 --> 18:48.521
All right, guys.
Bye-bye.

18:48.594 --> 18:49.891
Bye-bye.
Thanks for coming.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.589
Love you, too.

18:57.936 --> 18:59.426
<i>Are you blind?</i>

19:02.441 --> 19:04.602
<i>Oh, no, no! My demos!</i>

19:08.647 --> 19:11.138
Well, I'm gonna go do the dishes. Cool.

19:12.417 --> 19:14.908
It'd be nice if you helped me.
Damn it.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.079
<i>Way to go!</i>

19:16.155 --> 19:18.521
No problem. I'll get them
a little bit later.

19:18.590 --> 19:20.581
I'm just gonna hit the
streets here for a little bit.

19:20.659 --> 19:21.819
Gary, come on,
I don't want to do them later.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.657
Let's just do them now.
It'll take 15 minutes.

19:23.729 --> 19:26.755
Honey, I am so exhausted. I just
honestly want to relax for a little bit.

19:26.832 --> 19:30.529
If I could just sit here,
let my food digest,

19:30.769 --> 19:33.636
and just try to enjoy
the quiet for a little bit.

19:33.772 --> 19:36.366
Get some! Get some! Get some!
That's what happens.

19:36.441 --> 19:38.773
And we will... You know, we
can clean the dishes tomorrow.

19:38.844 --> 19:41.244
Gary, you know I don't like
waking up to a dirty kitchen.

19:41.313 --> 19:43.781
Who cares?
I care! All right? I care!

19:44.149 --> 19:47.812
I busted my ass all day cleaning
this house and then cooking that meal.

19:47.886 --> 19:50.286
And I worked today. It would
be nice if you said thank you

19:50.355 --> 19:52.289
and helped me with the dishes.

19:54.059 --> 19:57.256
Fine. I'll help you do the damn
dishes. Oh, come on. You know what?

19:57.329 --> 19:58.853
No. See?
That's not what I want.

19:58.931 --> 20:01.058
You just said that you want me
to help you do the dishes.

20:01.133 --> 20:05.365
I want you to want to do the dishes.
Why would I want to do dishes?

20:05.737 --> 20:08.171
Why?
See, that's my whole point.

20:09.007 --> 20:12.101
Let me see if I'm following this, okay?
Are you telling me that you're upset

20:12.177 --> 20:14.202
because I don't have a
strong desire to clean dishes?

20:14.279 --> 20:17.976
No. I'm upset because you don't have a
strong desire to offer to do the dishes.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.382
I just did.
After I asked you!

20:20.452 --> 20:24.252
Jesus, Brooke, you're acting crazy again.
Don't you call me crazy. I am not crazy.

20:24.323 --> 20:25.688
I didn't call you crazy.
You just did.

20:25.757 --> 20:26.849
I didn't call you...
No, I didn't.

20:26.925 --> 20:28.893
I said you're acting crazy.
You know what, Gary?

20:28.961 --> 20:31.293
I asked you to do one thing
today, one very simple thing,

20:31.363 --> 20:33.456
to bring me 12 lemons
and you brought me three.

20:33.532 --> 20:36.695
God damn it. If I knew that it
was gonna be this much trouble,

20:36.768 --> 20:39.259
I would have brought home
24 lemons. Even 100 lemons.

20:39.338 --> 20:41.806
You know what I wish? I wish everyone
that was at that goddamn table

20:41.873 --> 20:43.397
had their own little private
bag of lemons.

20:43.475 --> 20:44.669
Honest to God! Gary,
it's not about the lemons.

20:44.743 --> 20:45.903
Well, that's all
you're talking about.

20:45.978 --> 20:48.446
I'm just saying it'd be nice
if you did things that I asked.

20:48.513 --> 20:52.279
It would be even nicer if you did
things without me having to ask you!

20:54.386 --> 20:57.480
Well, I do seem to remember doing
something for you this morning

20:57.556 --> 20:58.887
without you asking.

20:58.957 --> 21:01.323
Gary, come on.
What? I'm serious. Come here.

21:01.393 --> 21:03.327
You know what? I'm serious.
I really am. I am, too.

21:03.395 --> 21:06.592
Come on. You knew I was working
today and I made that meal.

21:06.665 --> 21:10.192
And you could have thought to
yourself, you know, you could have said,

21:10.269 --> 21:13.136
"Yeah, I think I'm gonna
get Brooke some flowers. "

21:13.372 --> 21:16.569
You said on our very first date
that you don't like flowers,

21:16.642 --> 21:18.576
that they're a waste of money.

21:18.810 --> 21:20.072
Every girl likes flowers,
Gary.

21:20.145 --> 21:21.373
You said that you
don't like flowers.

21:21.446 --> 21:23.641
I'm supposed to take that to
mean that you do like flowers?

21:23.715 --> 21:26.479
No. This is not about... You're
not... God, you're not getting it.

21:26.551 --> 21:28.917
You're not getting this, Gary,
okay? It's not about the lemons.

21:28.987 --> 21:31.353
It's not about the flowers.
It's not about the dishes.

21:31.423 --> 21:34.824
It's just about... How many times do
I have to drop hints about the ballet?

21:34.893 --> 21:37.191
You know I can't stand...
Brooke, come here.

21:37.262 --> 21:40.595
We've talked about the damn
ballet. I hate the goddamn ballet!

21:40.666 --> 21:43.328
You got a bunch of dudes in tights
flopping around for three hours.

21:43.402 --> 21:45.336
It's like a medieval
techno show. It's a nightmare.

21:45.404 --> 21:47.065
I sit there in a sweat.
The whole thing, I do,

21:47.139 --> 21:49.232
wondering when the hell's the
goddamn nightmare gonna end.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.902
Go to a damn ballet. It's not
about you loving the ballet, Gary.

21:51.977 --> 21:54.172
It's about the person that
you love loves the ballet

21:54.246 --> 21:56.237
and you wanting to spend time
with that person.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.407
Not when they're
at the ballet.

21:57.482 --> 21:59.507
Okay. Forget the ballet!
Forget the ballet! I will.

21:59.584 --> 22:01.814
We don't go anywhere together.

22:02.754 --> 22:06.019
We just went to Ann Arbor
together. To Ann Arbor.

22:06.224 --> 22:08.215
To the
Michigan-Notre Dame game.

22:09.094 --> 22:13.724
You think screaming, drunk kids and
leprechauns doing backflips, that's fun.

22:13.799 --> 22:16.825
That's fun for me. Come
on, man. I did that for you.

22:16.902 --> 22:18.369
What do you...
How do you show up for me?

22:18.437 --> 22:21.099
I'm up on the bus
every goddamn day for you!

22:21.173 --> 22:22.765
Come on. You...
I'm busting my ass

22:22.841 --> 22:24.809
to be the best tour guide
in the damn city,

22:24.876 --> 22:26.935
so I can make enough money
to support both of us

22:27.012 --> 22:28.741
and hopefully you won't
have to work one day.

22:28.814 --> 22:30.975
I want to work.
All I ask, Brooke,

22:31.049 --> 22:33.142
is that you show a little bit
of appreciation.

22:33.218 --> 22:35.846
That I just get 20 minutes
to relax when I come home,

22:35.921 --> 22:39.584
instead of being attacked with
questions and nagged the whole damn time.

22:39.658 --> 22:42.456
You think that I nag you?
That's all you do!

22:42.561 --> 22:43.960
All you do is nag me!

22:44.029 --> 22:46.156
"The bathroom's a mess. "
"Your belt doesn't match. "

22:46.231 --> 22:48.222
"Hey, Gary, you should
probably go work out. "

22:48.300 --> 22:50.325
Nothing I ever do
is ever good enough!

22:50.402 --> 22:53.428
I just want to be left
the hell alone!

23:00.645 --> 23:02.806
Really? Is that
what you want, Gary?

23:02.881 --> 23:04.212
Is that what you want?
Yeah.

23:04.282 --> 23:05.306
That's what you want?
Yeah.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.249
Fine. Great.
Do whatever the hell you want.

23:07.319 --> 23:10.550
You leave your socks all over
this house, dress like a pig,

23:10.756 --> 23:14.157
play your stupid-ass video
game. I don't care, I'm done.

23:14.493 --> 23:16.723
What? I'm done! I don't deserve this.

23:16.795 --> 23:20.663
I really do not deserve this. I
deserve somebody who gives a shit.

23:20.732 --> 23:25.431
I'm not spending one more second of
this life with some inconsiderate prick!

23:25.737 --> 23:27.261
You're a prick!

24:48.353 --> 24:51.720
Addie, it just became
so clear tonight

24:51.790 --> 24:53.815
how much he takes me
for granted.

24:54.292 --> 24:56.522
<i>What happened?
Just the same old shit.</i>

24:56.595 --> 24:58.790
I asked him to do one thing
and he didn't do it.

24:58.864 --> 25:01.958
Then he complained
that he had to do anything,

25:02.033 --> 25:04.627
and I just felt like
I had no choice.

25:04.703 --> 25:06.261
No, sweetie,
you did have a choice, okay?

25:06.338 --> 25:09.501
And it sounds like you made the
right one. You respected yourself.

25:09.574 --> 25:13.066
But it's just not what I want. I
don't want to break up with him.

25:13.144 --> 25:17.137
I don't. I just want him to say thank
you. I want him to want to do the dishes.

25:17.215 --> 25:20.013
I just want him to want
to take me to the ballet.

25:20.218 --> 25:23.551
I want him to get me
12 lemons! You know...

25:25.190 --> 25:30.127
I just want him to care enough about
this relationship to want to work on it.

25:30.662 --> 25:32.254
Okay, you know what?
I'm putting on my shoes

25:32.330 --> 25:34.821
and I'm gonna be there in
15 minutes. No, Ad. Don't.

25:34.900 --> 25:37.368
Please, I really don't want
to see anybody. I really don't.

25:37.435 --> 25:38.800
But, look, I'm worried
about you, okay?

25:38.870 --> 25:41.065
And I can hear you in there
banging around your dishes.

25:41.139 --> 25:43.937
And I don't want you getting out
your Clorox and your rubber gloves,

25:44.009 --> 25:46.978
and taking this out on the
kitchen. Look, look, look.

25:47.846 --> 25:52.545
Okay. Tonight just... It
just got a little out of hand,

25:53.818 --> 25:57.811
and hopefully
he's just gonna realize

25:57.889 --> 26:01.325
that he's got some changes
to make and he's gonna...

26:02.527 --> 26:06.190
He's gonna come home
and apologize.

26:07.566 --> 26:10.330
Okay?
That's what's gonna happen.

26:11.336 --> 26:14.533
I feel like, I don't... You know, like,
you dress however you want to dress.

26:14.606 --> 26:15.937
You know,
do whatever you want to do.

26:16.007 --> 26:17.065
I'm done with the
relationship. Whatever.

26:17.142 --> 26:19.372
So, it's just kind of, "You're
done with the relationship?"

26:19.444 --> 26:20.877
Well, you're obviously
hurt about it.

26:20.946 --> 26:22.413
She got to you. You're hurt.
I'm not.

26:22.480 --> 26:24.038
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
She hurt you.

26:24.115 --> 26:25.275
Will you look at me?
I'm not heartbroken.

26:25.350 --> 26:26.681
I'm a little shocked.
I'm a little surprised.

26:26.751 --> 26:29.549
Gary, you're devastated. Now, what's
the name of the guy she's doing?

26:29.621 --> 26:31.350
I'm gonna solve your problem.
What's his name?

26:31.423 --> 26:33.550
What are you talking about?
Have you checked her e-mail?

26:33.625 --> 26:34.683
I don't check e-mails.
I don't...

26:34.759 --> 26:36.420
You can get a program
that records keystrokes.

26:36.494 --> 26:39.019
It costs, like, 20 bucks.
Very easy to use. Okay?

26:39.097 --> 26:42.555
You get a password, you check her
e-mail. You find out everything about her.

26:42.634 --> 26:43.931
That's how I found out
about the Puerto Rican

26:44.002 --> 26:45.594
that Stacy was running
around with. Okay.

26:45.670 --> 26:47.661
You are reading a little
too much into this situation.

26:47.739 --> 26:49.400
There is no one she's
running around with, okay?

26:49.474 --> 26:50.839
We had a fight over the
groceries I brought home.

26:50.909 --> 26:52.968
You're probably right. She's
probably not sleeping with anybody.

26:53.044 --> 26:54.375
No. Not what it's about.
Okay.

26:54.446 --> 26:55.970
Maybe she's with another
guy, maybe not. She's not.

26:56.047 --> 26:58.481
I don't know.
I'm not Columbo. Okay?

26:58.550 --> 27:02.213
But what we do know is that she
doesn't want to be with you anymore.

27:04.956 --> 27:08.357
I mean, I hate to be shitty about it,
and so cut and dry, but let's face it.

27:08.426 --> 27:11.486
She says she doesn't want to
be with you, and I believe her.

27:11.563 --> 27:13.588
Now, we gotta figure it out. And
you're gonna need a place to go

27:13.665 --> 27:15.826
and lick your wounds while you get
your head right over this thing.

27:15.900 --> 27:17.026
I don't need a place to go
and lick my wounds.

27:17.102 --> 27:18.126
You're gonna stay with me.

27:18.203 --> 27:19.568
I'm not gonna hear it.
Look it...

27:19.638 --> 27:21.629
I'm not moving out of the
place. Oh, you're not moving out.

27:21.706 --> 27:23.640
No. I put money in the place. I
put half my money in the place.

27:23.708 --> 27:26.074
You're obviously not the one
calling the shots in this case.

27:26.144 --> 27:28.135
Yeah, but I own the place.

27:28.213 --> 27:29.373
With her.
Yeah.

27:29.447 --> 27:31.210
But it's not up to her who
gets to keep the goddamn place.

27:31.282 --> 27:33.443
If you find out who she's sleeping
with, maybe we could leverage it.

27:33.518 --> 27:35.145
I want you to listen to me.
You listen to me.

27:35.220 --> 27:36.585
I'm gonna leave you a key.
I don't need a key.

27:36.655 --> 27:37.883
Why?
'Cause she's gonna put...

27:37.956 --> 27:39.389
She's gonna move out
of the place, Johnny.

27:39.457 --> 27:41.948
Did she say she was moving out?
She will. She's gonna move out.

27:42.027 --> 27:43.654
Oh, she's...
I'm gonna keep the place.

27:43.728 --> 27:45.218
I'm not moving
out of the place.

27:45.296 --> 27:46.820
I'll leave you a key.

29:16.087 --> 29:18.282
Hey, how's it going?
I almost got it.

29:18.356 --> 29:20.221
Yeah.
You know, I was thinking.

29:20.291 --> 29:21.656
You know what you should do,

29:21.726 --> 29:23.591
is you should find somebody
who looks like Brooke,

29:23.661 --> 29:26.027
but even hotter and, you know,
bang the shit out of her.

29:26.097 --> 29:28.725
What the hell's wrong with you? What?

29:29.801 --> 29:31.462
Logs.
Just fix the damn engine.

29:31.536 --> 29:34.096
I am fixing the goddamn
engine. I need your tour logs.

29:34.172 --> 29:35.867
I'm off the clock, okay?

29:35.940 --> 29:40.206
Well, I cannot file the
quarterlies until I have your log.

29:40.278 --> 29:42.303
I'm going through a little bit
of a life change here, Dennis.

29:42.380 --> 29:46.214
I would really appreciate a
little bit of sensitivity, please.

29:50.555 --> 29:53.388
I know they're both French, but
that has nothing to do with it.

29:53.458 --> 29:57.326
Because Manet was earlier and... No.
Monet and Manet are very different things.

29:57.395 --> 29:58.692
I'm sorry, I beg to differ.

29:58.763 --> 30:01.163
Excuse me, sir, can I have her
call you back personally?

30:01.232 --> 30:03.723
Yes. Okay, thank you.
Sorry. Brooke?

30:05.770 --> 30:08.170
I am so sorry.
What?

30:08.940 --> 30:10.032
Come here.

30:10.942 --> 30:13.934
Oh, honey, your mom called
and told me everything.

30:14.012 --> 30:15.377
Oh, Jesus.

30:18.016 --> 30:20.246
Good morning, Marilyn.

30:21.486 --> 30:23.954
Morning.
I'll go water the plants.

30:25.390 --> 30:28.325
I understand you had a long
night. Tell me everything.

30:28.393 --> 30:29.826
"Everything. "
I couldn't possibly...

30:29.894 --> 30:31.555
Then don't.
My time is pressing.

30:31.629 --> 30:33.995
What I want is for you to
take the rest of the day off.

30:34.065 --> 30:36.124
Oh, no.
No, that's not necessary.

30:38.102 --> 30:39.569
Who am I?

30:40.305 --> 30:42.637
Marilyn Dean.
And where are we?

30:44.342 --> 30:48.244
The Marilyn Dean Gallery.
And of whom is that portrait?

30:53.384 --> 30:56.911
That is Marilyn Dean.
Yeah.

30:59.057 --> 31:02.390
You know, your personal life
is your personal life.

31:02.961 --> 31:05.691
But you look like shit.
And when you look like shit,

31:05.763 --> 31:09.062
Marilyn Dean looks like shit,
and now it is my business.

31:09.133 --> 31:13.126
And when it comes to my business, I
don't like anything that's distracting.

31:13.605 --> 31:17.371
So, I want you to take the
rest of the day off to be sad

31:18.443 --> 31:22.004
and then come back to work tomorrow
ready to take care of business.

31:22.580 --> 31:23.774
Got it?

31:56.981 --> 31:58.881
Oh, hey, Brooke. How are you?

31:59.617 --> 32:01.642
What the hell are you doing?

32:01.719 --> 32:05.621
Well, my whole life, I always wanted
my own place with my own pool table.

32:05.690 --> 32:07.180
I finally got my own place,

32:07.258 --> 32:10.625
but you would not allow me
to have a pool table.

32:11.229 --> 32:15.495
I just kind of figured I'd rectify
that today. And it does feel good.

32:15.566 --> 32:19.366
I'm gonna go ahead and put the
four ball in the corner pocket.

32:19.437 --> 32:20.665
Nice.

32:22.840 --> 32:26.071
I'm sorry, can I... A little
room for the shooter, please?

32:27.211 --> 32:30.180
It's hard to shoot with
someone standing... Thank you.

32:36.854 --> 32:38.151
Wow.

32:39.123 --> 32:43.787
Well, I guess he feels threatened that
you broke up with him and he's acting out.

32:44.662 --> 32:48.120
Okay, look, Brooke, men are like
children. You know? And they...

32:48.599 --> 32:52.228
Sweetie, it's a figure of speech.
It's Brooke. And I love you so much.

32:52.303 --> 32:57.104
And you're my man and you know
that. You're amazing. I love you.

32:57.508 --> 33:00.773
Listen, and they're gonna test boundaries
to see what they can get away with.

33:00.845 --> 33:03.075
<i>I think there's three things
that Gary needs to know.</i>

33:03.147 --> 33:07.379
One, this type of behavior is not
unnoticed. Two, it's not acceptable.

33:07.452 --> 33:11.650
And three, you know, you're definitely
not gonna tolerate it. Right?

33:11.990 --> 33:13.116
Yes.

33:13.191 --> 33:16.422
<i>And Brooke, remember, we're
always owning our actions, right?</i>

33:16.494 --> 33:19.122
<i>And we're always
healthy with it, yes?</i>

33:20.198 --> 33:21.460
Yes.

33:21.833 --> 33:24.097
I don't wanna finish the game.
I got showings, okay?

33:24.168 --> 33:26.261
I gotta buy the cookie spray.
I gotta clean up the dog.

33:28.339 --> 33:31.035
And now I'm really leaving 'cause
I don't want to hear that. Okay?

33:31.109 --> 33:33.907
Thank you for the pool.
Thank you for the snacks.

33:42.420 --> 33:45.116
I'm going to get a cab.
I'll split it with you.

33:56.467 --> 33:59.732
What are you, 12?
Brooke, that is not healthy.

33:59.804 --> 34:01.897
I'm trying to make a point.
And what is that point?

34:01.973 --> 34:04.498
My point's your point.
Your three points.

34:04.575 --> 34:08.739
That it's not unnoticed,
that it was not acceptable,

34:08.880 --> 34:11.405
and that it would definitely
not be tolerated.

34:11.482 --> 34:13.245
Not exactly what I meant.

34:16.788 --> 34:18.255
Unbelievable.

34:21.492 --> 34:23.255
I knew it!
Hey, gang.

34:23.360 --> 34:26.387
Found my shirt on the floor.
Thanks for laying it out.

34:28.166 --> 34:32.534
Gary, are you here for
couples bowling? Yeah.

34:33.337 --> 34:36.568
Well, don't you think you and I
should discuss something first?

34:36.641 --> 34:39.007
Like what? How your
47 average is killing us?

34:39.077 --> 34:41.670
Okay. Great. No.

34:41.746 --> 34:46.012
Gary, this is couples bowling. And
since you and I are no longer a couple,

34:46.317 --> 34:48.012
because you have chosen

34:48.085 --> 34:51.987
not to participate constructively
in our relationship,

34:52.190 --> 34:53.851
we're now singles.

34:53.925 --> 34:57.520
So, there's not room
for two singles on the team.

35:02.166 --> 35:04.066
Why do you look confused?

35:05.169 --> 35:09.435
I don't have any idea what's happening.
I've come to play on the team.

35:09.674 --> 35:11.266
Look, Gary, I just don't think
it's a good idea

35:11.342 --> 35:14.140
for you and I to be around each other
any more than we have to right now.

35:14.212 --> 35:16.339
I completely agree. Maybe you
should go play some pinball.

35:16.414 --> 35:19.440
No, I think you should leave.
Okay.

35:20.718 --> 35:25.678
Brooke, when a man makes a commitment
to a team, he honors that commitment.

35:26.491 --> 35:30.427
He doesn't let emotions or personal
issues get in the way of victory.

35:30.495 --> 35:32.929
And I've made a commitment
to this team.

35:32.997 --> 35:36.626
They don't want you here either,
Gary. Yeah. Sure, they don't.

35:36.701 --> 35:38.464
They don't.
They're my friends.

35:38.536 --> 35:42.233
But you're not a strong
bowler. That's not the point.

35:42.340 --> 35:45.707
You know what? Let's just...
Why don't we let them decide?

35:45.776 --> 35:49.405
Gary, don't. No. Don't involve
them, okay? That's unnecessary.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.243
What's wrong, Castro?
Castro?

35:51.315 --> 35:53.078
Well, Castro doesn't
let people vote as a team.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.278
Okay. Ask them.
Thank you.

35:55.453 --> 35:58.013
Okay, everyone.
Team vote here.

35:58.256 --> 36:01.589
By a show of hands, just put
it up when you make a decision,

36:01.959 --> 36:05.759
who here agrees with Brooke and
thinks I should leave the bowling team?

36:08.132 --> 36:09.360
Shocker.

36:27.652 --> 36:30.815
<i>Band of Brothers.
You should rent it sometime.</i>

36:33.391 --> 36:37.191
Good luck, everyone. Riding
Miss Gutter Ball to the finals.

36:38.829 --> 36:41.662
Hey, Gary.
Yeah.

36:43.668 --> 36:46.535
I'm gonna need your shirt back. What?

36:47.138 --> 36:50.403
Well, we're gonna have to replace
you, and you know we get docked 10 pins

36:50.474 --> 36:53.341
if everyone's not in matching
Pin Shakers uniforms.

36:54.212 --> 36:56.305
My shirt says "Gary" on it.
Granted.

36:56.380 --> 36:59.679
But actually,
we know a guy named Gary.

37:00.318 --> 37:04.049
And he's not as tall as you,
but he's a pretty good bowler.

37:13.331 --> 37:16.732
I'm gonna have to request that
I have my wrist guard back then.

37:17.868 --> 37:19.927
I'm sorry. That's mine.

37:24.742 --> 37:27.267
Just give me the goddamn
wrist guard, please. Thank you.

37:27.345 --> 37:29.313
I hope your wrist snaps.

37:35.386 --> 37:37.513
Wow. Okay? You see that?
You know what I mean?

37:37.588 --> 37:39.146
Yeah. That was awesome.

37:39.223 --> 37:41.885
You just had your ex-boyfriend,
who you wish you were still dating,

37:41.959 --> 37:43.984
voted off the bowling team.

37:44.095 --> 37:46.359
Well, I had to do that to get
him right where I want him.

37:46.430 --> 37:48.227
Where's that?
Shirtless in the parking lot?

37:48.299 --> 37:50.665
Addie,
you're not getting this.

37:50.968 --> 37:54.335
Gary loves this bowling team.
He's hurt right now.

37:54.405 --> 37:56.032
He's feeling pretty bad.

37:56.107 --> 37:58.803
He's gonna go out there
and he's gonna get drunk.

37:58.876 --> 38:01.470
He's gonna make
a complete fool of himself.

38:01.545 --> 38:04.013
And he will be sitting there
feeling pretty lonely

38:04.081 --> 38:07.380
and pretty pathetic, and
then it's just gonna hit him.

38:08.152 --> 38:09.983
What's gonna hit him?

38:10.388 --> 38:12.413
That not only is he
out a girlfriend,

38:12.490 --> 38:15.357
but his life is just
falling apart piece by piece

38:15.426 --> 38:17.291
and maybe that life
was pretty great.

38:17.361 --> 38:20.159
And maybe I was the glue that
was holding it all together.

38:20.231 --> 38:21.789
And if he wants
that life back,

38:21.866 --> 38:24.596
he's gonna have no choice
but to change.

38:27.605 --> 38:29.732
How about this, huh? I feel
like we just found hell.

38:29.807 --> 38:31.798
When did you start coming
to knobby joints like this?

38:31.876 --> 38:33.935
I might be the greatest
you've ever seen, pal.

38:34.011 --> 38:36.445
I'm conquering new frontiers.
Hello, babe.

38:36.514 --> 38:39.005
Yeah, you've got to put up with
the bad music and the $15 drinks,

38:39.083 --> 38:42.211
but this place is stacked with
top-shelf, young, dumb ass.

38:42.286 --> 38:44.584
All you gotta do is just separate
the weaker ones from the herd.

38:44.655 --> 38:45.849
Come on,
I'll get you into the VIP.

38:45.923 --> 38:47.686
Can I get a couple drinks
from you? Okay, L.G.

38:47.758 --> 38:49.885
Lupus, I got to be totally...
I got to be honest with you.

38:49.960 --> 38:51.120
I'm not feeling it here.

38:51.195 --> 38:52.594
You're gonna like it in here.
You're gonna love it.

38:52.663 --> 38:54.756
I don't like it out here. Look,
listen to me, will you, please?

38:54.832 --> 38:55.958
How you doing, Buzz?

38:56.033 --> 38:58.228
While you were on the inside
locked up for the past two years,

38:58.302 --> 38:59.599
the game has changed.

39:03.708 --> 39:06.233
Do you remember
when you were an outdoor cat

39:06.510 --> 39:08.774
and you used to have to hunt
and kill for your food?

39:08.846 --> 39:10.279
Well, you've become
an indoor cat.

39:10.348 --> 39:11.906
You've been getting your milk
brought to you

39:11.982 --> 39:13.040
in a silver bowl,
and guess what?

39:13.117 --> 39:14.744
Now, you've been
tossed back outside

39:14.819 --> 39:18.016
and the alley has changed. For
example, your MTV generation,

39:18.089 --> 39:21.024
your technology, your text
message, your TiVo. You name it.

39:21.092 --> 39:23.287
People want their
information faster.

39:23.361 --> 39:26.353
People e-mail each other because they
want to exchange information, Gar.

39:26.430 --> 39:29.024
They don't want to connect,
they want results.

39:29.600 --> 39:31.795
Okay. You gotta get
to the message quicker.

39:31.869 --> 39:34.667
Now, I want you to watch.
It's real simple. Okay?

39:37.007 --> 39:38.338
How you doing, ladies?

39:38.409 --> 39:39.501
Now, here's what I'd like
to do to you.

39:39.577 --> 39:41.977
First, I'd like to
get you naked.

39:42.046 --> 39:43.673
And then I'm gonna take
some Saran Wrap

39:43.748 --> 39:45.477
and I'm gonna wrap you
up in it, head to toe.

39:45.549 --> 39:46.641
Then I'm gonna
cut out two holes.

39:46.717 --> 39:48.582
One for your mouth, so
you can breathe, obviously.

39:48.652 --> 39:49.778
And the other one...
Asshole.

39:49.854 --> 39:51.515
It could be a gorgeous
evening for us, babe.

39:51.589 --> 39:52.851
The pink is gorgeous.
Jesus, God.

39:52.923 --> 39:54.857
Come here. Lupus, listen to
me. I want you to listen to me.

39:54.925 --> 39:56.222
There are our drinks.
You want your drink?

39:56.293 --> 39:58.420
No, I'm fine. Thank
you. The L.G. Thanks you.

39:58.496 --> 40:01.522
Will you listen to me, please? You're
my brother and I love you very much,

40:01.599 --> 40:04.090
and maybe you do get laid tonight,
but maybe you get arrested.

40:04.168 --> 40:06.295
Arrested for what, babe?
Being awesome?

40:06.370 --> 40:09.999
Come on, babe, listen. You want to
tell your jokes, tell your jokes.

40:10.074 --> 40:13.874
But sooner or later you're gonna get
hungry and you're gonna wanna eat.

40:14.145 --> 40:17.637
And jokes might make you feel
better, but they don't get you fed.

40:19.750 --> 40:21.513
I'm gonna go take a lap.

40:32.430 --> 40:35.297
What are you doing?
I'm sketching.

40:35.766 --> 40:37.700
And where are you sketching?

40:38.102 --> 40:40.229
In the living room.
No, in my bedroom.

40:40.304 --> 40:41.896
And I didn't say anything
to you, Brooke,

40:41.972 --> 40:44.270
when you so arrogantly claimed
the bed without asking me,

40:44.341 --> 40:47.708
but you can't just waltz into my
room and turn it into a damn art fair.

40:47.778 --> 40:50.110
Gary, I've only taken up
a little bit of space, so...

40:50.181 --> 40:52.149
I don't care if you only
took an inch.

40:52.216 --> 40:55.708
There might not be a door here,
but this is my domain. Okay?

40:55.786 --> 40:58.118
I don't go into your bedroom
and set up a goddamn sawhorse.

40:58.189 --> 41:00.885
Well, then what the hell is that
pool table doing in the dining room?

41:00.958 --> 41:03.426
Because that's a common area.
And that's where this belongs.

41:03.494 --> 41:04.961
Not in my room.
Hey, what are you doing?

41:05.029 --> 41:06.724
It belongs in another common area. Gary.

41:06.797 --> 41:09.265
People want to come home and
they want to relax in their room.

41:09.333 --> 41:12.097
Gary, it is 2:00
in the morning!

41:12.169 --> 41:14.729
Don't you drop my things. I
don't know what to tell you, kid.

41:14.805 --> 41:15.829
This is how I am
when I'm single.

41:15.906 --> 41:17.965
My hours start to get
pretty strange.

41:18.042 --> 41:19.976
Might be time for you
to think about moving out.

41:20.044 --> 41:22.069
Why would I...
No, I'm not moving anywhere.

41:22.146 --> 41:24.205
Gary, just please
turn the volume down.

41:24.281 --> 41:26.476
Yeah, but I don't tell you what
the hell to do in your room.

41:26.550 --> 41:28.074
You can doodle. You can dance.

41:28.152 --> 41:29.551
You can bake
a goddamn gingerbread house.

41:29.620 --> 41:30.644
I don't give a shit.

41:30.721 --> 41:33.485
But in my room, I want to
relax and watch my highlights

41:33.557 --> 41:36.151
in complete surround-sound
experience.

41:37.194 --> 41:39.685
What the hell are you doing?
You're not even gonna watch it!

41:39.763 --> 41:41.355
Don't tell me what I am
or aren't not doing.

41:41.432 --> 41:43.024
Oh, what you are not,
not doing?

41:43.100 --> 41:45.364
Go learn some English.
Oh, I'm sorry.

41:45.436 --> 41:48.928
I didn't have a grandfather on
the board of some fancy college.

41:49.006 --> 41:51.736
Key word being "was. " Did he
touch the Filipino exchange student?

41:51.809 --> 41:53.071
Did he not touch
the exchange student?

41:53.143 --> 41:54.701
I don't know, Brooke.
I wasn't there. Okay.

41:54.778 --> 41:56.075
No, don't start
with the family stuff.

41:56.146 --> 41:58.171
Like your family's so perfect?
Your brother's a pervert!

41:58.249 --> 42:00.717
Don't talk to me about the
sexual habits of family members.

42:00.784 --> 42:02.411
What about your sister?

42:03.354 --> 42:06.517
My sister's been through a lot. Of dick.

42:07.591 --> 42:10.116
There are some problems, Gary,
but can we please just leave it...

42:10.194 --> 42:14.255
Problems? She slept with the entire
Arizona Cardinals offensive line.

42:14.431 --> 42:17.025
That's not problems.
That's she's the problem!

42:17.101 --> 42:20.070
She was on vacation!
She was on vacation.

42:20.404 --> 42:22.998
Don't even get me started,
by the way, on your brother.

42:23.073 --> 42:25.507
If I have to hear that guy
sing just one more time,

42:25.576 --> 42:27.737
I'd hang myself
with wax dental floss.

42:27.811 --> 42:30.575
Could the guy just come
out of the closet, please?

42:30.648 --> 42:32.946
Richard is not gay.

42:35.185 --> 42:38.746
Okay, lassie, I want you to
listen to me and listen good.

42:38.822 --> 42:40.084
I'm not saying
he won't get married.

42:40.157 --> 42:42.387
I'm not saying
he won't even have kids.

42:42.459 --> 42:43.756
But then one day
his wife will come home,

42:43.827 --> 42:45.886
and then she'll find him
with a guy named Majulio,

42:45.963 --> 42:48.659
wearing leather helmets and clubbing
each other to Yanni's greatest hits.

42:48.732 --> 42:50.324
Yeah. Right. Whatever.
You're an infant.

42:50.401 --> 42:51.925
Yeah, I'm an infant.

42:52.002 --> 42:54.436
Go enjoy your room, Brooke,
'cause I'm gonna enjoy mine!

42:54.505 --> 42:55.699
Okay.
You know what?

42:55.773 --> 42:57.798
I might enjoy some
pay-per-view options tonight.

42:57.875 --> 42:59.137
It's gonna be a long one,
sweetheart,

42:59.209 --> 43:01.200
<i>and I got nothing to do mañana
but sleep in.</i>

43:50.427 --> 43:53.624
<i>Boogie nights Ain't no
doubt we are here to party</i>

43:53.697 --> 43:54.959
What are you doing?

43:55.032 --> 43:56.829
<i>Boogie nights Come on
now, got to get it started</i>

43:56.900 --> 43:58.265
Ricky, you and
the Get Along Gang leave

43:58.335 --> 44:00.269
or I'm gonna throw you out of
here personally, you understand?

44:00.337 --> 44:02.066
Actually, Gary,
this is Brooke's bedroom.

44:02.139 --> 44:04.699
So, technically, you don't
have jurisdiction here,

44:04.775 --> 44:07.710
but I think it'd be really fun
if you sang with us.

44:07.778 --> 44:09.473
Come on, Gary.
I think you'll like it.

44:09.546 --> 44:10.911
You got 10 seconds
to get out of here

44:10.981 --> 44:12.448
or I'm gonna break
your damn magic whistle.

44:12.516 --> 44:14.484
You understand
what I'm saying to you?

44:14.551 --> 44:16.678
Move this group
out of my house, now!

44:22.860 --> 44:26.057
Gary, you can't take a pitch
pipe out of a guy's hand

44:26.130 --> 44:28.758
when he's in the middle
of a very funky groove.

44:28.832 --> 44:30.493
You can get hurt
doing something like that.

44:30.567 --> 44:32.228
I'm tapping out,
I'm tapping out!

44:32.302 --> 44:33.929
Here we go. From the bridge.

44:34.004 --> 44:38.771
<i>Party night Get on down
with the sound of the music</i>

44:38.842 --> 44:41.538
<i>Boogie nights
Do it, do it</i>

44:51.288 --> 44:53.779
What kind of bullshit move
was that?

44:54.425 --> 44:57.258
I'm sorry. What? What happened?
Oh, don't be coy with me.

44:57.327 --> 45:01.286
You sent that animal over here to
attack me when I was hung over and weak.

45:02.566 --> 45:05.330
Oh, no. Look, all I know
is The Tone Rangers,

45:05.402 --> 45:06.801
they needed someplace
to rehearse,

45:06.870 --> 45:10.328
so I very clearly told
Richard, "Stay in my room,"

45:10.574 --> 45:14.101
which you explained to me was
my space to do with what I want.

45:14.445 --> 45:16.913
Is that how you want to play it?
'Cause I'll play it like that.

45:16.980 --> 45:18.106
I'll play it like
Lionel Richie.

45:18.182 --> 45:20.810
All night long, lady.
Oh, yeah.

45:20.918 --> 45:22.715
I'll call some guys
from my neck of the woods.

45:22.786 --> 45:23.912
And we're not talking, Brooke,

45:23.987 --> 45:26.251
about a couple of queens
who know a few grapples.

45:26.323 --> 45:29.656
We're talking about Polacks
that don't have a goddamn future.

45:29.727 --> 45:30.989
Right.
That's right!

45:31.061 --> 45:32.926
We can make shit real
uncomfortable around here,

45:32.996 --> 45:34.156
and that's what
we're gonna do.

45:34.231 --> 45:35.630
Please. Come on.
You know what?

45:35.699 --> 45:38.759
You're just embarrassed
because Richard kicked your ass.

45:41.171 --> 45:44.402
Richard did not kick my ass.

45:44.541 --> 45:48.238
What Richard did was attack me
when I was half asleep.

45:48.312 --> 45:50.212
Really?
Is that how you see it?

45:50.280 --> 45:53.511
There's a really big gap
between getting your ass kicked

45:53.584 --> 45:57.452
and having a dancing, singing
sprite fool you with trickery

45:57.521 --> 46:00.957
and then strike your throat before
you know that you're even in a fight.

46:01.024 --> 46:03.151
And I wouldn't expect someone
like you to understand that,

46:03.227 --> 46:07.254
because all you ever do is make
moves from up in your ivy tower.

46:07.998 --> 46:11.331
Wow. You have officially
gone off the reservation.

46:11.401 --> 46:14.393
I'm an adult. I talk through
shit. He ran out of ideas.

46:15.139 --> 46:18.597
God. Listen, by the way, there's
messages on the voice mail

46:18.675 --> 46:20.939
regarding game night, which
is obviously not gonna happen,

46:21.011 --> 46:24.503
so you might want to call people
and tell them that it's canceled.

46:24.581 --> 46:26.378
Why would I cancel game night?
Well, I mean...

46:26.450 --> 46:28.748
If it's our turn to host game,
I'm gonna host goddamn game night.

46:28.819 --> 46:30.514
You want to host game night?
I'm fine, Brooke.

46:30.587 --> 46:33.715
I don't have any strangeness
over what happened here today.

46:33.791 --> 46:34.780
Okay.

46:34.858 --> 46:37.486
If there's anyone that should
feel weird about seeing people,

46:37.561 --> 46:40.359
that's you, Tonya Harding. Me?
I'm gonna honor my commitments.

46:40.430 --> 46:41.795
Great.
Great.

46:41.865 --> 46:42.991
Fine.
Fine.

46:43.066 --> 46:44.897
Let's do that.
Let's do that.

46:45.035 --> 46:47.060
Let's honor the commitment.

46:50.107 --> 46:52.041
Hey, there's no food in there!
So?

46:52.109 --> 46:55.476
Well, people are gonna be here in an
hour. What are they supposed to eat?

46:55.546 --> 46:57.537
You're a big boy.
Figure it out.

47:07.658 --> 47:10.422
Oh, great.
Well, that's what we got.

47:10.828 --> 47:14.355
We have only tap water because,
you know, Gary didn't shop.

47:14.431 --> 47:18.367
And we don't have any ice either
'cause he didn't fill the trays.

47:18.669 --> 47:20.762
That's trash. It's your shot.
What is your name again?

47:20.838 --> 47:21.930
Diane.
Diane.

47:22.005 --> 47:23.097
Did you call?
I called the five.

47:23.173 --> 47:24.765
Well, yeah, but you didn't
call the second ball,

47:24.842 --> 47:25.934
so that's trash,
so it's your shot.

47:26.009 --> 47:27.943
You got to play
by the rules. It's your shot.

47:28.011 --> 47:29.035
Hi.
Hi.

47:29.179 --> 47:31.374
Andrew.
Oh, hi.

47:31.982 --> 47:33.950
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey, hey!

47:34.051 --> 47:36.645
These two Benedict Arnolds
aren't welcome in my condo.

47:36.720 --> 47:38.915
Who sent an invite to them?
I'm sorry.

47:38.989 --> 47:42.925
These are very loyal friends and
they are always welcome in my condo.

47:42.993 --> 47:46.156
Oh, really? Why don't we take it to a
vote and see who has the numbers this time?

47:46.230 --> 47:47.561
All right.
Show of hands here.

47:47.631 --> 47:51.499
Who thinks that these two traitors should
leave and not be a part of game night?

47:51.568 --> 47:53.661
And maybe take their shirts
off when they leave.

47:53.737 --> 47:56.934
Raise your hand. I know
I feel that way. Who else?

47:57.541 --> 47:59.099
Come on, Johnny O,
put your hand up, please.

47:59.176 --> 48:01.940
Come on. Thank you.
You, Miss? New girl.

48:02.379 --> 48:05.143
Who's the girl? What's
her name? What's her name?

48:05.215 --> 48:07.877
The girl you're with. What's
her name? Her name's Diane.

48:07.951 --> 48:10.943
Oh, I'm sorry. You might want
to go ahead and touch some sky.

48:11.021 --> 48:13.888
Thank you. Come on, Riggleman,
please? What are you doing?

48:13.957 --> 48:16.187
No. We need the eight to
count towards a running tally.

48:16.260 --> 48:17.352
You know that. Come on.

48:17.427 --> 48:19.486
Show her whose side that you're
on. Put your hand in the air.

48:19.563 --> 48:22.464
You know whose side I'm on. You
know we need eight, though. Come on.

48:22.532 --> 48:24.261
Put your hand down.

48:29.039 --> 48:30.370
Please don't touch
my Ruffles.

48:30.440 --> 48:31.702
Put that one back.
Those are my Ruffles.

48:31.775 --> 48:33.140
Don't eat them, please.
Thank you.

48:33.210 --> 48:34.700
Oh, Gary.
They're mine.

48:34.778 --> 48:36.006
Come on.
Here we go. All right.

48:36.079 --> 48:38.843
Eyes front. Ready? Hold on.
Get the timer going, please.

48:38.916 --> 48:41.009
Ready?
Now I gotta do it. Go.

48:41.084 --> 48:42.676
Okay.
It's a brick.

48:42.753 --> 48:44.550
Square. Square.
Box. Box.

48:44.621 --> 48:47.112
Corner. Corner.
A dot in the corner.

48:47.190 --> 48:48.748
A house.
Home plate!

48:48.825 --> 48:52.090
Football! Baseball! Sports. A
house. A triangle. It's algebra.

48:52.162 --> 48:54.096
Okay, it's a house.
It's a house.

48:54.164 --> 48:55.563
It's a house.
Two words.

48:55.632 --> 48:57.190
Banana? Chimney, chimney, chimney!

48:57.267 --> 48:59.997
A fruit. House. Fruit.

49:00.070 --> 49:01.594
Oh, restaurant. Or...

49:01.672 --> 49:03.037
No, chimney, chimney.
Smoke...

49:03.106 --> 49:05.199
Oh, a house call.
House call!

49:05.275 --> 49:06.674
Oh! House call!

49:06.743 --> 49:08.506
Yeah, well, I thought
it was a house call.

49:08.578 --> 49:10.569
Like a hotel, then it hit
me it was a house. Yeah!

49:10.647 --> 49:12.615
You're terrific.
Absolutely terrific.

49:12.683 --> 49:13.741
All right, beat that.

49:13.817 --> 49:15.011
Okay, guys, listen.
The next one wins, okay?

49:15.085 --> 49:16.712
So let's stay focused.
Let's stay calm.

49:16.787 --> 49:18.812
We can do this. High fives.
Let's go. Come on. Let's go.

49:18.889 --> 49:21.084
Let's get a mind-meld. Let's
try and get a mind-meld, okay?

49:21.158 --> 49:22.591
Here we go. Let's go.
Mind-meld. I heard you!

49:22.659 --> 49:24.126
Don't over-think it. Mind meld. Ready?

49:24.194 --> 49:25.957
I heard you!
Well, just keep it simple.

49:26.029 --> 49:27.121
Shush.

49:27.197 --> 49:29.665
Ready? Wait. Go! Here we
go! We're mind-melding.

49:29.733 --> 49:31.394
Draw faster. It doesn't
have to be beautiful,

49:31.468 --> 49:32.833
just has to be something
we can get. Shoe, shoe...

49:32.903 --> 49:34.632
Shoe! Shoe, shoe, shoe.

49:35.005 --> 49:37.337
Shoeless Joe Jackson. Draw something
different. No one's getting it.

49:37.407 --> 49:39.068
Shoe. What, is that a
smaller shoe? Baby shoe.

49:39.142 --> 49:41.167
Smaller shoe. Baby shoes.
Shoes.

49:41.244 --> 49:42.836
Baby shoes.
Smaller shoe. Gumshoe.

49:42.913 --> 49:44.073
Smaller shoes.
Gumshoe? Gumshoe?

49:44.147 --> 49:46.672
Running Olympics.
Inside the shoe.

49:47.351 --> 49:49.546
Inside a shoe. A bubble...
Lining.

49:49.619 --> 49:51.814
Stop pointing at the shoe. We're
not... No one's guessing shoe.

49:51.888 --> 49:53.446
Stop pointing at the shoe
and draw something different.

49:53.523 --> 49:54.547
Draw something different.
You...

49:54.624 --> 49:57.115
Goddamn it!
No one's guessing shoe!

49:57.194 --> 50:00.322
You drew a big shoe, then a
small shoe, and no one got it.

50:00.397 --> 50:03.662
You gotta draw something different.
Everyone said "shoe" seven times.

50:03.734 --> 50:05.497
It's a sock, asshole.

50:06.703 --> 50:07.897
You call yourself an artist?
Yes!

50:07.971 --> 50:10.599
A three-year-old with a box of crayons
could do a better job than this.

50:10.674 --> 50:13.404
I'm sorry, I don't have the great talent
of standing on top of a big red bus

50:13.477 --> 50:15.672
and pointing out architecture
that other great men have built!

50:15.746 --> 50:16.974
I'm the one who should
be sorry, Brooke.

50:17.047 --> 50:18.776
I shouldn't sit here
and pick on your art. No.

50:18.849 --> 50:20.942
Because you got the
nuts part down, Picasso.

50:21.018 --> 50:22.610
All you have to do is
cut off your frigging ear.

50:22.686 --> 50:23.846
That's Van Gogh,
you idiot!

50:23.920 --> 50:25.854
And your insults are much more
effective when they're accurate.

50:25.922 --> 50:27.048
Don't talk to me about
being goddamn accurate!

50:27.124 --> 50:28.250
I can talk to you
about anything that I want.

50:28.325 --> 50:29.587
'Cause you couldn't even
draw a sock.

50:29.659 --> 50:30.751
You don't do anything right!
You're a lazy...

50:30.827 --> 50:32.055
Everyone said,
"Shoe, shoe, shoe!"

50:32.729 --> 50:36.665
At first, I figured that the
split was just something temporary,

50:36.733 --> 50:39.827
something that you two
would work out and get past,

50:39.903 --> 50:41.495
but after tonight
I think it's pretty clear

50:41.571 --> 50:44.631
that you two genuinely do
not want to get back together.

50:44.741 --> 50:46.606
There's not a shot in hell.
Gary.

50:46.676 --> 50:48.337
I'm just...
I got you.

50:48.979 --> 50:51.675
As your friend
and as your realtor,

50:51.748 --> 50:52.908
I'm not gonna
leave here tonight

50:52.983 --> 50:54.610
until we decide
what to do about this condo,

50:54.684 --> 50:59.018
because this living situation
is obviously not working out.

51:02.259 --> 51:03.419
Gary?

51:07.664 --> 51:10.462
Well, the only logical thing
that I can think of

51:11.034 --> 51:14.003
is for her to move out
of the condo,

51:14.071 --> 51:17.837
and then to pay me some sort
of a penalty as compensation for

51:17.908 --> 51:20.138
the labor that I did all
around the condo. What? What?

51:20.210 --> 51:23.270
What? Pay you compensation
for your labor?

51:23.613 --> 51:26.480
We fixed this place up
together. Are you nuts?

51:26.550 --> 51:28.211
Stop calling me nuts, I
swear to God. I fixed the...

51:28.285 --> 51:29.411
You went around with a sponge,

51:29.486 --> 51:30.976
and you went in the bathroom
and you dotted foofy shit.

51:31.054 --> 51:32.612
That's what you're saying
that I did? There's no...

51:32.689 --> 51:34.213
That was...
That's called aesthetics.

51:34.291 --> 51:36.316
It warmed this place up
so it didn't look like

51:36.393 --> 51:38.623
an army barracks,
which it was about to.

51:38.695 --> 51:40.629
I'll tell you what it's called
in his language, depreciated.

51:40.697 --> 51:42.688
That's what it's called. You
don't even know what that means.

51:42.766 --> 51:45.132
Unless the next buyer happens to
have your same Zulu-voodoo-land taste.

51:45.202 --> 51:46.499
All right. Let me tell
you something else.

51:46.570 --> 51:48.970
It's gonna cost money to
cover up the holes in the wall.

51:49.039 --> 51:52.440
The holes that you drilled in the wall there
to hang up whatever that thing is called.

51:52.509 --> 51:53.567
Oh, please. Gary.

51:53.643 --> 51:54.632
You're gonna have
to cost money to fix that.

51:54.711 --> 51:57.271
What I did, Brooke, has
concrete value to the condo.

51:57.347 --> 51:59.178
I added concrete...
Well, let's just go on record.

51:59.249 --> 52:02.082
We're dealing with facts here.
I did the tiling in the bathroom.

52:02.152 --> 52:03.881
Have you seen...
I did the new track lighting.

52:03.954 --> 52:05.785
That tile is the shittiest
tile job. I did the plumbing!

52:05.856 --> 52:07.289
The plumbing!
That's realty terms.

52:07.357 --> 52:09.120
Okay. Let's talk about your
plumbing. This is his plumbing.

52:09.192 --> 52:10.352
We have two temperatures
in our bathroom.

52:10.427 --> 52:13.157
We get either scalding hot
or we get frostbite.

52:13.230 --> 52:14.720
That's it. That's all we get.
It's my problem

52:14.798 --> 52:16.163
that she doesn't know how
to pace a shower?

52:16.233 --> 52:17.222
Now all of a sudden
that's my fault.

52:17.300 --> 52:18.358
I get a minute
to take a shower.

52:18.435 --> 52:19.663
One minute?
One minute of warmth?

52:19.736 --> 52:21.863
Oh, Jesus. One minute.
That's it. That's correct.

52:21.938 --> 52:24.668
Thank God you're not in charge of
keeping all the clocks in Chicago on time.

52:24.741 --> 52:27.209
This is basic logic. You are out
of your mind. You have lost it.

52:27.277 --> 52:29.074
Let me explain this to you
in plain chapter and verse.

52:29.146 --> 52:33.207
Cheese and rice, you guys are gonna
kill each other. Now, let's just...

52:33.283 --> 52:35.808
Realistically speaking,
neither one of you

52:35.886 --> 52:38.013
can afford this mortgage
on your own, okay?

52:38.088 --> 52:41.717
And that's a shame, because this building
will continue to increase in value.

52:41.791 --> 52:44.055
I get nothing but phone
calls about it, all right?

52:44.127 --> 52:45.719
Waiting for a unit to open up.

52:45.795 --> 52:49.492
So, as your realtor, the last
thing I would suggest is selling.

52:49.566 --> 52:53.093
But as your friend, I just, I
don't see any other solution.

52:53.470 --> 52:55.301
You take your halves,
you go your separate ways,

52:55.372 --> 52:57.363
and you get on
with your lives.

52:59.176 --> 53:03.875
I know that selling is not the easiest
thing, but I do think that it's the best.

53:04.848 --> 53:08.079
And to be honest,
this is a situation

53:08.151 --> 53:11.416
where I would just as soon
not take a commission.

53:14.958 --> 53:18.155
That's great. Thank you. That's
great. Thank you for that.

53:18.228 --> 53:20.025
I wish I didn't have to,
you know,

53:20.096 --> 53:22.963
but company policy says
I cannot waive that.

53:23.767 --> 53:25.894
But I was just... You know,
I'm saying in theory, you know.

53:25.969 --> 53:30.338
In this situation, 'cause we're
friends, I wish I could waive it.

53:30.440 --> 53:31.839
No can do, though.

53:32.142 --> 53:36.169
As soon as you can, I would love
to get a set of keys from you guys.

53:36.246 --> 53:39.147
You just drop them off.
Okay. Great. There they are.

53:39.216 --> 53:41.343
I'll be bringing by
people all week.

53:41.418 --> 53:45.479
You won't even know I'm here. The
good news is, should move quickly.

53:45.922 --> 53:47.116
All right.

53:48.225 --> 53:50.216
Okay to leave you two
alone now?

53:50.493 --> 53:53.951
Got to get back to Jen. Very
excited about the win tonight.

53:55.131 --> 53:56.257
Okay.

54:11.481 --> 54:13.506
Addie, if the condo sells,
I think I'm gonna lose him.

54:13.583 --> 54:15.278
<i>Yeah, but game night
was so light and fun,</i>

54:15.352 --> 54:17.411
<i>I'm really surprised
to be hearing this.</i>

54:17.487 --> 54:19.785
Okay. You know what? That's
not constructive. Really.

54:19.856 --> 54:22.222
I just... Yeah, I need
a new plan, Addie. I don't...

54:25.328 --> 54:26.625
I'm just kidding. It's me.

54:26.696 --> 54:28.857
I'm gonna have to
call you back.

54:30.066 --> 54:33.229
Whenever one of my friends is down,
we all go on, like, happy patrol.

54:33.303 --> 54:35.533
I was actually having
a very serious conversation.

54:35.605 --> 54:36.936
Christopher, do not sing.

54:37.007 --> 54:40.602
<i>If you're happy and you
know it Clap your hands</i>

54:41.745 --> 54:45.078
<i>If you're happy and you
know it Clap your hands</i>

54:45.148 --> 54:47.912
<i>If you're happy and you know
it You're going to smile to...</i>

54:51.021 --> 54:53.182
Pack up your shit and go home.

54:55.292 --> 54:56.782
Okay. You know what?
This is not his fault.

54:56.860 --> 54:59.727
He was just really trying
to cheer me up and it...

55:04.834 --> 55:08.361
Did I or did I not give you
the day off to be sad?

55:08.438 --> 55:10.998
Yes. But I...
Well, today's not that day,

55:11.107 --> 55:14.201
and unfortunately for you,
I can't afford to look weak.

55:14.277 --> 55:15.403
No, please.

55:15.578 --> 55:19.378
You have warned me so many times
and you have yet to fire me.

55:19.582 --> 55:23.416
I think you and I both know that
to find and train somebody new,

55:23.486 --> 55:26.250
it's gonna cost you time,
and it's gonna cost you money,

55:26.323 --> 55:29.451
and I don't think you want
to spend either one of those.

55:30.427 --> 55:33.624
Now, look, I'm just gonna
take a wild guess here,

55:33.697 --> 55:36.962
but you don't become
Marilyn Dean

55:37.934 --> 55:40.061
without knowing
how to handle men.

55:40.637 --> 55:44.368
Okay? Now, just listen
to my problem,

55:44.941 --> 55:48.104
tell me how to fix it, and
then we'll all go back to work.

55:50.547 --> 55:54.039
Okay. What is this problem
so severe

55:54.617 --> 55:58.747
that has caused you to blaspheme
in the synagogue of Marilyn Dean?

55:59.789 --> 56:03.452
Well, it's Gary.
I broke up with him

56:04.361 --> 56:08.957
in hopes that losing me
would make him want to change,

56:09.032 --> 56:11.091
and that's, you know...

56:11.568 --> 56:15.504
And I've just ended up pushing him,
you know, farther and farther away.

56:16.940 --> 56:20.000
That's it?
Yeah.

56:20.877 --> 56:25.814
Honey, this is not surrealism
or cubism, it's paint-by-numbers.

56:27.784 --> 56:31.720
Go see Mischa,
my personal waxer at the spa.

56:31.921 --> 56:34.446
Ask her for the Telly Savalas.

56:35.759 --> 56:37.590
The Telly Savalas.

56:38.194 --> 56:39.991
Compliments of M. Dean.

56:40.764 --> 56:44.928
Then go show Gary
your immaculate canvas

56:45.001 --> 56:48.835
and let him see another man
eager to paint it. Got it?

56:50.273 --> 56:51.535
Got it?
Uh-huh.

56:57.213 --> 56:58.339
Ow!

57:10.460 --> 57:12.121
Who loves you, baby?

57:13.163 --> 57:16.655
<i>Wow, impressive.
Three sharp hands landed.</i>

57:16.733 --> 57:19.896
<i>What an amazing display
of punching technique.</i>

57:19.969 --> 57:22.631
<i>The crowd jumps.
That punch rocked him.</i>

57:22.705 --> 57:25.173
<i>They sense he's on the verge
of hitting the canvas.</i>

57:25.241 --> 57:28.267
<i>The roaring for anticipation
of a knockout.</i>

57:28.344 --> 57:31.040
<i>We are witnessing
a great fight.</i>

57:31.114 --> 57:34.515
<i>He's displaying incredible
rhythm with his hands.</i>

57:35.151 --> 57:39.952
<i>Bulldog terrorizing
his opponent. Down he goes!</i>

57:40.023 --> 57:42.548
<i>Hard punch slams him
to the canvas.</i>

57:48.898 --> 57:52.026
<i>One, two, three,</i>

57:52.101 --> 57:56.765
<i>four, five, six, seven, eight,</i>

57:57.373 --> 58:00.308
<i>Nine, ten. It's over.</i>

58:12.956 --> 58:15.857
Is... Did... Is Brooke here?

58:17.293 --> 58:18.521
I don't know.

58:27.770 --> 58:30.170
Brooke?
I'll be right there.

58:40.984 --> 58:42.576
<i>Cool, baby, cool.</i>

58:51.127 --> 58:53.561
So, how do you and Brooke
know each other?

58:53.630 --> 58:56.793
Well, how don't we know each
other, you know what I mean?

58:57.800 --> 59:01.497
Hi, Paul.
Oh, hey. Wow, you look great.

59:01.571 --> 59:02.560
Thank you.

59:02.639 --> 59:06.040
Are you ready to go?
Yeah. All set.

59:06.643 --> 59:10.272
So, it was great meeting you.
Apple martinis.

59:10.346 --> 59:12.405
All right, come on.
That normally does the trick.

59:12.482 --> 59:14.746
Just ignore him. But just
two. Three, she'll get sloppy.

59:14.817 --> 59:16.011
You'll become a babysitter.

59:16.085 --> 59:19.213
Oh, and fantasy role playing. She's
got a real thing for lifeguards.

59:19.289 --> 59:22.349
Put some zinc oxide on your
nose and she'll lose her mind.

59:22.425 --> 59:23.517
It'll all be over with.

59:26.896 --> 59:29.023
<i>Y'all want me
to stop running?</i>

59:59.729 --> 01:00:01.822
I mean, the most challenging
part of what I do

01:00:01.898 --> 01:00:04.992
is between February
and April 15th.

01:00:05.068 --> 01:00:08.435
That's what we in the biz
like to call crunch time.

01:00:09.672 --> 01:00:11.264
That sounds fascinating.

01:00:11.341 --> 01:00:12.933
Good evening.
Hi.

01:00:13.009 --> 01:00:14.738
Can I start you two off
with something to drink?

01:00:14.811 --> 01:00:19.077
Yeah, you know, we're gonna start with
a couple of apple martinis, please.

01:00:19.649 --> 01:00:23.676
No, you know what? I'm gonna...
I'm just gonna start with a water.

01:00:23.753 --> 01:00:26.153
Well, you can just bring those,
just in case. What was I saying?

01:00:26.222 --> 01:00:27.416
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:30.482
So, you know, it's not like
it's all work and no play.

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:34.296
You know, I mean, after April
15th, that's what we in the biz

01:00:34.364 --> 01:00:36.525
like to call party time.

01:00:37.834 --> 01:00:38.926
Excuse me.

01:00:41.004 --> 01:00:43.598
Oh, I have to get this.
I'm so sorry.

01:00:43.673 --> 01:00:44.731
Hello.

01:00:44.807 --> 01:00:47.241
<i>Okay, is this when I'm
supposed to call? What?</i>

01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:49.778
What do you mean? What?
Where? What happened?

01:00:49.846 --> 01:00:53.407
<i>Okay, that's great.
Wait. What? Oh, all right.</i>

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:55.781
Listen, where... Just
don't move. Where are you?

01:00:55.852 --> 01:00:57.877
<i>I'm sitting in my kitchen.
Sitting? Okay.</i>

01:00:57.954 --> 01:00:59.922
Don't move.

01:00:59.989 --> 01:01:03.925
Don't... I'm gonna be right there,
honey. I'm gonna be right there, okay?

01:01:03.993 --> 01:01:05.790
Is everything okay?
Oh, my gosh.

01:01:05.862 --> 01:01:07.329
That was my best friend.

01:01:07.397 --> 01:01:11.231
She just had an accident and
she... She has this knee thing

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:14.269
and she's just very fragile,
and I have to go. What?

01:01:14.404 --> 01:01:16.804
I can give you a ride.
No. No. That's okay.

01:01:16.873 --> 01:01:19.603
I'm gonna grab a cab, so...
I'm so sorry.

01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:21.200
I like your dress.

01:01:21.978 --> 01:01:26.005
I think he's fascinating. He's
obviously read a lot of books.

01:01:26.082 --> 01:01:27.709
Yeah. Yeah, I bet he has.

01:01:27.784 --> 01:01:31.083
He reads a lot of books because
nobody wants to talk to him.

01:01:31.387 --> 01:01:34.845
He's a friend of Andrew's
who's always been polite.

01:01:34.924 --> 01:01:37.324
It's the best I could do
on such short notice, okay?

01:01:37.393 --> 01:01:39.452
Well, you know what?
Polite is not gonna do it.

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:43.522
We've got to find somebody who
is really gonna make Gary jealous.

01:01:44.701 --> 01:01:45.759
Can I just say something?

01:01:45.835 --> 01:01:47.234
You sound a little jealous,
Gary.

01:01:47.303 --> 01:01:49.203
Why would I be jealous of
some guy with computer skills?

01:01:49.272 --> 01:01:52.833
Let's say he doesn't have computer skills,
but he's got a big old elephant hog on him?

01:01:52.909 --> 01:01:54.638
Would that bother you or
would you be okay with that?

01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:56.110
Not nearly as much as the way
that your mind works.

01:01:56.179 --> 01:01:57.476
My mind works great.

01:01:57.547 --> 01:02:00.812
So, what's this bullshit I hear
about you selling the condo?

01:02:00.983 --> 01:02:02.974
Selling that condo
is ludicrous.

01:02:03.086 --> 01:02:04.610
I was waiting for
when I was gonna get

01:02:04.687 --> 01:02:07.281
the how-Gary-always-
screws-his-life-up speech again.

01:02:07.356 --> 01:02:08.983
This must be the right time.
Look, you tell me,

01:02:09.058 --> 01:02:11.117
you just tell me, tell me. Is
it happening now? Yeah. Okay.

01:02:11.194 --> 01:02:13.788
Tell me how
losing that asset

01:02:13.863 --> 01:02:16.957
is gonna get us
on the river?

01:02:17.033 --> 01:02:20.730
Go ahead, just tell me. Tell me.
Somebody tell me. What is this?

01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:24.203
What is this? What is it? What
is it? Hey! Don't patronize me.

01:02:24.273 --> 01:02:26.264
Helicopters.
Helicopters. Exactly!

01:02:26.342 --> 01:02:28.310
How does losing the asset
give us helicopters?

01:02:28.377 --> 01:02:32.108
Dennis, I'm being totally serious with
you. I don't need this shit right now.

01:02:32.181 --> 01:02:34.274
Hey, you want to cry,
cry to Mom.

01:02:35.051 --> 01:02:36.985
Nobody's crying.
I'm not crying.

01:02:37.053 --> 01:02:39.817
I just don't feel like hearing
it. There's no feelings here.

01:02:39.889 --> 01:02:43.586
This is about money and
business. Fine, you broke up.

01:02:46.496 --> 01:02:48.191
You broke up. Fine.

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:51.256
You know, sad.

01:02:52.468 --> 01:02:56.962
Sad is, instead of putting $1,000
into your mortgage every month,

01:02:57.039 --> 01:03:00.008
you waste it on rent.
That's what sad is.

01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:04.906
Oh, you're broke up. You're
confused, brokenhearted.

01:03:05.181 --> 01:03:08.309
Heartbreak is not
having that money

01:03:08.384 --> 01:03:12.081
as part of your net worth
and then not saving the money,

01:03:12.388 --> 01:03:15.221
so that after taxes
you can invest!

01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:20.491
You know, you're confused.

01:03:22.298 --> 01:03:25.859
Are you finished? Look,
I need the damn tour logs.

01:03:27.937 --> 01:03:28.926
Yeah.

01:03:29.739 --> 01:03:32.333
Well, I really, really
appreciate the heart to heart.

01:03:32.408 --> 01:03:34.774
It was a great talk, Dennis.
Thank you.

01:03:34.944 --> 01:03:38.004
Oh, well, you're behind three months.
You're still behind three months.

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:41.174
And those logs are imperative to
insuring that our books are straight!

01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:43.878
I'll tell you what those logs are.
Those logs are bullshit is what they are!

01:03:43.953 --> 01:03:45.853
You got the receipts. Tally
the goddamn things yourself!

01:03:45.922 --> 01:03:47.048
I do, I do!

01:03:47.123 --> 01:03:50.559
And I don't appreciate it, because
it cuts into my time with my family.

01:03:50.626 --> 01:03:53.595
I could be spending that time with
my family instead of doing your books.

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:55.858
I already do the taxes.
I do the billing.

01:03:55.932 --> 01:03:59.163
I do the hiring, the firing.
I do the maintenance.

01:03:59.235 --> 01:04:02.261
Come on, what do you do?
What is it that you do?

01:04:02.338 --> 01:04:05.136
You do the tours!
I am the talent, Dennis!

01:04:05.575 --> 01:04:08.066
They sign up a month
in advance to see me.

01:04:08.211 --> 01:04:12.511
They'll wait in line for the
next bus to see me! All right?

01:04:13.916 --> 01:04:18.410
So don't drain me with all this
bullshit about the goddamn tour logs!

01:04:32.401 --> 01:04:34.392
<i>How big's your TV?
Oh, shut up!</i>

01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:36.836
How big's your TV, 'cause I wanna
know if you can see what's happening.

01:04:36.906 --> 01:04:38.601
<i>Oh, wow.
You beat a 12-year-old.</i>

01:04:38.674 --> 01:04:41.507
I don't care if you're 12 years old.
You have more time in the day to play.

01:04:41.577 --> 01:04:42.908
I live in the real world,
my man,

01:04:42.979 --> 01:04:45.812
With bills
and responsibilities.

01:04:46.015 --> 01:04:47.482
That's right.

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:51.008
You can't have a handle called Mad Dog
Killer if you complain every time...

01:04:51.087 --> 01:04:53.146
Brooke?
Hi, Mike.

01:04:53.222 --> 01:04:55.019
Hi.
Come on in.

01:04:55.091 --> 01:04:56.285
<i>Hold on, Mom. I'm coming.</i>

01:04:56.359 --> 01:04:57.348
Is your mom
in the room with you?

01:04:57.426 --> 01:04:59.656
'Cause I hope she can't see
what's happening.

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:01.321
I hope she can't see
what's happening.

01:05:01.397 --> 01:05:04.332
I'm gonna be just a few more
seconds. So, just sit down and relax.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.265
Oh, yeah, no problem.

01:05:06.335 --> 01:05:08.633
I'm sorry?
Yeah, why'd you do that?

01:05:08.704 --> 01:05:12.504
You take the fun out of beating you,
because you have an excuse to lose.

01:05:12.575 --> 01:05:13.667
<i>Get a life, dude.</i>

01:05:13.743 --> 01:05:16.211
Do you think it's possible that
your mom won't love you anymore

01:05:16.279 --> 01:05:18.008
if she sees how bad
you're losing in the game.

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.172
<i>Shut up!</i>

01:05:44.373 --> 01:05:45.362
Okay.

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:47.970
All right.

01:05:49.845 --> 01:05:51.972
That's great. You're gonna
stay man-to-man with me.

01:05:52.048 --> 01:05:53.413
What happens
when I make a play?

01:05:53.482 --> 01:05:56.315
Making plays, making plays!
Making plays!

01:05:56.385 --> 01:05:58.717
Well, you know, that's how my
people like to handle their business.

01:05:58.788 --> 01:06:01.279
While your guys are out
partying, mine are running routes.

01:06:01.357 --> 01:06:02.756
Try to make a difference.

01:06:02.825 --> 01:06:05.259
Mike? I'm ready to go.

01:06:07.163 --> 01:06:08.653
Oh, hey,

01:06:10.266 --> 01:06:14.134
do you mind if we finish the game?
We got a real nail-biter going here.

01:06:18.874 --> 01:06:21.570
Yeah, sure. Of course. Great.

01:06:22.845 --> 01:06:24.472
Awesome, all right?

01:06:28.951 --> 01:06:31.078
Touchdown.
Oh, God, is that pretty.

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:34.517
God, is that pretty.
Yeah, I'm a gentleman.

01:06:34.757 --> 01:06:38.056
I like to be humble. I'm old
school. I don't like to talk a lot.

01:06:38.127 --> 01:06:41.528
But at the same time,
am I talented?

01:06:41.964 --> 01:06:43.989
Tell me how you felt about
what just happened there.

01:06:44.066 --> 01:06:46.034
That's him going deep.
That's him going...

01:06:46.102 --> 01:06:48.866
Work ethic. Work ethic.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.774
I could play this game
forever.

01:06:52.842 --> 01:06:54.969
Oh, I could, too. I love it,
yeah. I love it, don't you?

01:06:55.044 --> 01:06:56.409
I mean, it's the kind of thing
where literally

01:06:56.479 --> 01:06:59.209
I play the game and it's like,
four hours go by.

01:07:00.783 --> 01:07:03.980
Fate has me highly skilled
and loaded with talent.

01:07:04.353 --> 01:07:05.479
Oh...

01:07:05.554 --> 01:07:08.216
'Cause I think I'm good enough
to figure out how to beat myself.

01:07:08.290 --> 01:07:09.348
You push yourself.

01:07:09.425 --> 01:07:11.393
You push yourself trying
to achieve the impossible,

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:13.724
because you know
that when that moment comes

01:07:13.796 --> 01:07:18.165
that everything you've done up to that
moment has prepared you for victory!

01:07:18.601 --> 01:07:20.398
I can't take credit
for it, Mike.

01:07:20.469 --> 01:07:23.961
I got to thank these little
digital guys with the big hearts.

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:26.736
Does it feel good to be
a champion? Yeah.

01:07:26.809 --> 01:07:30.142
Yeah, it feels good to
be a champion. Good game.

01:07:30.579 --> 01:07:33.207
Hey, Brooke,
are you ready to go now?

01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:36.912
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure.
Great.

01:07:36.986 --> 01:07:39.079
Hey, Gary, thanks a lot, man.
It was great to meet you.

01:07:39.155 --> 01:07:40.520
Absolutely, man.

01:07:41.657 --> 01:07:44.820
Come on, Mike. I know
a great little martini bar.

01:08:07.716 --> 01:08:08.774
<i>Yo.</i>

01:08:08.851 --> 01:08:10.910
Hey, man, saddle up. It's
time to rope in some talent.

01:08:10.986 --> 01:08:11.975
<i>What's up? What do you got?</i>

01:08:12.054 --> 01:08:14.614
My place. Tonight. Poker.
Call some girls up.

01:08:16.192 --> 01:08:18.956
Your roommate is awesome.

01:08:19.028 --> 01:08:20.256
Mmm.

01:08:20.563 --> 01:08:22.292
Yeah, he's something.

01:08:23.698 --> 01:08:26.759
So, where did you go to law
school? Oh, Northwestern.

01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:29.870
God, Gary's hilarious.

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:32.532
Yeah, he's okay.

01:08:33.075 --> 01:08:35.600
Okay? I mean,
the guy's all time.

01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:39.247
But he's gonna take Chicago
tourism by air, land and sea.

01:08:42.151 --> 01:08:44.210
And he asked me to join
his new bowling team.

01:08:44.286 --> 01:08:46.310
I mean, how cool is that?

01:08:46.388 --> 01:08:47.514
Mmm-hmm.

01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:50.520
You know what? I can't
do this. I'm so sorry.

01:08:50.593 --> 01:08:54.154
Excuse me, would you please pull
over? Can you pull over, please?

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:02.804
Hey, wait.

01:09:04.406 --> 01:09:06.033
Tell Gary to call me.

01:09:08.377 --> 01:09:09.502
<i>Welcome, everyone,</i>

01:09:09.578 --> 01:09:12.877
to the first annual Texas Hold'em
No-Limit Strip Poker Tournament.

01:09:14.116 --> 01:09:17.676
Now, per the e-mail that Lupus sent,
we each have eight articles of clothing.

01:09:17.752 --> 01:09:19.948
Now, if you want to bet, you
take off an article of clothing,

01:09:20.022 --> 01:09:21.113
you put it in the center.

01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:24.488
If you win, you take back the
clothes, you put back on what you bet.

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.653
The extras that other people
bet will stay in front of you,

01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:27.991
much the same as chips would.

01:09:28.063 --> 01:09:29.496
You can go all in
at any point,

01:09:29.564 --> 01:09:32.625
but as I outlined, you must take
off all your clothes to do so.

01:09:32.701 --> 01:09:34.895
The game shall last an hour,
maybe two,

01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:38.770
at which point we will begin
the dance portion of the evening.

01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:41.370
Let's get going here.

01:09:41.443 --> 01:09:42.636
I need to see the blinds.
Small blind. Big blind.

01:09:42.711 --> 01:09:43.837
The blinds are one and one.

01:09:43.912 --> 01:09:45.243
Come on, ladies.
All right.

01:09:45.314 --> 01:09:47.339
Oh, yeah.
Let's get going here.

01:09:48.017 --> 01:09:50.109
Shuffle up and deal.
All right.

01:09:53.087 --> 01:09:54.646
I mean, just because they
were playing video games,

01:09:54.723 --> 01:09:57.248
that doesn't mean
it didn't bother him, right?

01:09:57.326 --> 01:10:00.727
Honestly, Brooke, I wish I could
tell you, but I wasn't there.

01:10:00.930 --> 01:10:02.693
All right, Sally, get the
soap out of your mouth.

01:10:02.765 --> 01:10:04.699
We're gonna save that
for when you're 12.

01:10:04.767 --> 01:10:06.792
Mike was really,
really good-looking.

01:10:06.869 --> 01:10:09.497
I mean, he's a little bit of a
goof, but Gary doesn't know that.

01:10:09.572 --> 01:10:12.063
I mean, for all he knows,
a sophisticated,

01:10:12.141 --> 01:10:14.905
really good-looking guy
took me out on a date tonight.

01:10:14.977 --> 01:10:17.445
I could be in bed with this
guy right now for all he knows.

01:10:17.513 --> 01:10:18.707
You know?

01:10:18.814 --> 01:10:21.715
I'm telling you, if you
saw the look on his face,

01:10:23.185 --> 01:10:24.709
Mike got to him.

01:11:22.511 --> 01:11:23.500
Hello.

01:11:23.612 --> 01:11:26.911
<i>Hey, it's Riggleman.
Great news.</i>

01:12:36.285 --> 01:12:37.718
So, how does this work?

01:12:37.786 --> 01:12:40.380
I'll bring the car around front
and you wrap them up to go?

01:12:40.456 --> 01:12:42.447
Oh, no, no.
We take care of everything.

01:12:42.524 --> 01:12:46.722
We deliver it. We hang it. We check
the light and the sun exposure.

01:12:46.795 --> 01:12:48.524
Oh. Perfect.
Yeah.

01:12:50.032 --> 01:12:52.500
Listen, I don't want to be
too forward,

01:12:53.268 --> 01:12:56.396
but would you like to have
some dinner with me sometime?

01:12:59.942 --> 01:13:02.604
I'm sorry. I have a boyfriend.

01:13:02.711 --> 01:13:04.474
Of course.
So...

01:13:04.546 --> 01:13:07.208
Well, he's a lucky man.
Oh, thank you.

01:13:07.549 --> 01:13:11.747
I guess I will just have to keep it to
home deliveries and gallery purchases.

01:13:13.055 --> 01:13:15.046
Thank you, though. See you.

01:13:15.124 --> 01:13:17.285
Have a good day, Brooke.
You, too.

01:13:25.567 --> 01:13:27.535
Okay, are you
out of your mind?

01:13:27.970 --> 01:13:30.165
Gary's throwing Greek orgies
in your living room

01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:32.332
and you're telling hot rich
guys you have a boyfriend?

01:13:32.408 --> 01:13:35.571
Are you nuts? Hey, look. I'm
not exactly innocent here.

01:13:35.744 --> 01:13:38.338
Brooke, as an outsider with some
perspective, I really think you...

01:13:38.414 --> 01:13:40.279
Christopher, stop. Stop it.
I don't want to hear it.

01:13:40.349 --> 01:13:41.611
This has already gotten
way out of hand.

01:13:41.683 --> 01:13:45.244
I know what I have to do now, all
right? I know what I have to do.

01:14:05.207 --> 01:14:06.299
Hi.

01:14:07.042 --> 01:14:08.031
Hi.

01:14:10.712 --> 01:14:14.113
Did you get my note?
Yeah.

01:14:16.084 --> 01:14:17.381
Two weeks.

01:14:19.054 --> 01:14:20.043
Yep.

01:14:23.258 --> 01:14:25.726
I brought some boxes
from work,

01:14:26.428 --> 01:14:29.522
so, you know, if you need
any just help yourself.

01:14:31.967 --> 01:14:34.197
Great. Thanks.

01:14:38.874 --> 01:14:39.966
Oh.

01:14:40.042 --> 01:14:44.536
Listen, a while ago
I got these tickets

01:14:44.613 --> 01:14:48.845
for the Old 97's tonight, and I
completely forgot about it, so I...

01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:52.344
You know, if you want to go.

01:14:56.225 --> 01:14:58.386
Well, how many tickets
did you get?

01:14:58.994 --> 01:15:00.086
I got two.

01:15:02.231 --> 01:15:04.426
How much do you want for them?

01:15:04.967 --> 01:15:06.867
Oh, no, I'm going. I'm going.

01:15:09.938 --> 01:15:12.304
So, then it would just be
the two of us?

01:15:14.243 --> 01:15:18.145
Well, yes,
and 2,000 other people.

01:15:19.114 --> 01:15:21.309
I mean, it's not a big deal,

01:15:21.383 --> 01:15:24.250
but, you know, look, you know,
I was going to invite Addie,

01:15:24.319 --> 01:15:27.413
but I just figured
I'd gotten them for you, so...

01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:35.792
Sure. Why not?

01:15:37.599 --> 01:15:39.362
Are you sure? I mean,
if you don't want them,

01:15:39.434 --> 01:15:42.232
I can definitely give them to
somebody. No. No, I'll be there.

01:15:42.304 --> 01:15:45.933
That sounds...
It sounds great.

01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:50.906
Okay. All right.
It's at the Riv.

01:15:51.947 --> 01:15:54.643
So, I'll just leave
your ticket at Will Call.

01:15:56.084 --> 01:15:57.551
Good?
Okay.

01:15:57.619 --> 01:15:58.608
Okay.

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:07.851
Yeah, so, there. I'll just
leave that for him. Okay, great.

01:16:07.930 --> 01:16:09.090
Okay, so.
Gary Grobowski?

01:16:09.164 --> 01:16:10.722
Grobowski, yeah.
He should be here in a minute.

01:16:10.799 --> 01:16:13.233
He's really... He's oddly
tall, so. Oh, okay. Great.

01:16:13.302 --> 01:16:15.065
You won't miss him. Thanks.
All right, have a good night.

01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:40.855
Hi. Can I get a beer, please?
Sure.

01:16:40.929 --> 01:16:42.829
Actually, make that two beers.

01:16:49.037 --> 01:16:51.267
It's gonna be $8.

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:53.798
Excuse me. Sorry.

01:17:03.151 --> 01:17:04.880
<i>Hello, everybody!</i>

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:07.982
<i>Good evening, Chicago.
We're the Old 97's.</i>

01:18:59.568 --> 01:19:00.557
Brooke?

01:19:05.407 --> 01:19:07.773
Are you up?
Yeah.

01:19:09.444 --> 01:19:11.935
Are you okay?
I'm fine.

01:19:13.515 --> 01:19:16.780
Are you sure?
What's up? What do you want?

01:19:20.388 --> 01:19:23.721
I just want to say I'm sorry
that I missed the concert,

01:19:24.559 --> 01:19:28.017
and let me know what that ticket
cost, I'll pay you back for it.

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:34.029
Just leave me alone, Gary.

01:19:38.373 --> 01:19:40.398
I planned on going
to the concert.

01:19:40.475 --> 01:19:41.965
It's just, I stopped by
Johnny O's and we...

01:19:42.043 --> 01:19:43.374
It doesn't fucking matter,
okay?

01:19:43.445 --> 01:19:46.107
Would you just leave my room
and shut the door?

01:19:46.581 --> 01:19:48.572
Jesus.
Please.

01:19:52.354 --> 01:19:55.346
I didn't really know that the
concert mattered all that much to you.

01:19:55.423 --> 01:19:56.412
Exactly.

01:19:57.425 --> 01:19:59.325
Hold on a second here.
Let me talk for a second.

01:19:59.394 --> 01:20:00.383
Gary...

01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:03.954
Brooke. You broke up with me.

01:20:07.369 --> 01:20:09.234
Then you have guys
coming over here for dates,

01:20:09.304 --> 01:20:11.465
and all of a sudden you ask
me to go to some concert.

01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:13.201
I mean, I just figured that,
you know.

01:20:13.275 --> 01:20:14.572
Gary.

01:20:19.247 --> 01:20:21.613
I just... I don't know
how we got here.

01:20:26.388 --> 01:20:28.117
Our entire relationship

01:20:28.757 --> 01:20:32.625
I've gone above
and beyond for you, for us.

01:20:34.996 --> 01:20:37.226
And I mean, I've cooked.

01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:40.861
I've picked your shit up
off the floor.

01:20:40.936 --> 01:20:44.463
I've laid your clothes out for
you like you were a four-year-old.

01:20:45.373 --> 01:20:48.467
I support you.
I supported you, your work.

01:20:49.578 --> 01:20:53.571
If we ever had dinner or
anything, I make the plans.

01:20:53.648 --> 01:20:58.415
I take care of everything and I just
don't feel like you appreciate any of it.

01:21:02.023 --> 01:21:04.048
I don't feel
you appreciate me.

01:21:07.596 --> 01:21:12.431
And all I want is to... Is for
you to just show me that you care.

01:21:18.306 --> 01:21:20.467
Why didn't you just
say that to me?

01:21:21.176 --> 01:21:24.737
Gary, I've tried. I've tried.

01:21:25.547 --> 01:21:27.242
Yeah, but never like that.

01:21:28.783 --> 01:21:31.445
You might've said some things that
you meant to imply that, Brooke,

01:21:31.519 --> 01:21:33.248
but I'm not a mind reader.

01:21:35.257 --> 01:21:38.317
I doubt it would matter.
You are who you are.

01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:43.895
Just leave me alone, okay?

01:21:45.867 --> 01:21:47.732
Right now. Just shut my door.

01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:53.398
Listen.

01:21:53.475 --> 01:21:56.000
All right, Gary, just, please.
Just leave the room.

01:21:56.077 --> 01:21:57.101
Listen to me.
Gary, just...

01:21:57.178 --> 01:21:59.646
I don't want to be near you right
now. Listen to me. I just want to...

01:21:59.714 --> 01:22:02.774
Please, just shut the door.
Please.

01:22:16.331 --> 01:22:18.765
I know. Look, I know you feel bad,
but, you know, what are you gonna do?

01:22:18.833 --> 01:22:21.631
I mean, what does she expect, for me to
want to go with the girl who dumped me?

01:22:21.703 --> 01:22:24.433
I don't know. She probably just wanted
you, you know, to show her the respect

01:22:24.506 --> 01:22:26.337
of not standing her up
or some shit, who knows?

01:22:26.408 --> 01:22:28.239
Well, damn it. I should have
just said no in the first place.

01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:29.368
I don't know why I called...

01:22:29.444 --> 01:22:30.468
You know what?
It's her fault she got hurt.

01:22:30.545 --> 01:22:34.538
You shouldn't even feel bad about it.
She should have expected it from you.

01:22:37.319 --> 01:22:39.810
You're a fun guy, okay?
Everybody likes you.

01:22:39.888 --> 01:22:43.380
You're the quickest guy I know.
Anytime we go out, I have a blast.

01:22:43.458 --> 01:22:44.857
All right? But, you know,

01:22:44.926 --> 01:22:47.952
everybody who knows you knows
you're gonna do what you want to do.

01:22:48.029 --> 01:22:52.193
And if it's not what the other person
wants to do, well, that's their problem.

01:22:52.567 --> 01:22:53.795
That's bullshit.
It's not bullshit.

01:22:53.868 --> 01:22:55.597
There's plenty of times I do
shit that I don't want to do.

01:22:55.670 --> 01:22:57.069
That's ridiculous. No.
Like when?

01:22:57.138 --> 01:22:58.230
That's bullshit to say
about me.

01:22:58.306 --> 01:23:01.332
When have we ever done
something you didn't want to do?

01:23:02.644 --> 01:23:05.545
You know, I don't know, off the top
of my head. I don't keep score...

01:23:05.613 --> 01:23:07.843
When's the last time
we went to a Sox game?

01:23:07.916 --> 01:23:09.247
The Sox.

01:23:09.317 --> 01:23:11.808
Not when they're playing
the Cubs, either.

01:23:12.587 --> 01:23:15.613
We always do what you want to do and
she always did what you want to do.

01:23:15.690 --> 01:23:17.089
It's who you are.

01:23:17.158 --> 01:23:19.683
Everybody thinks that
you're their friend, okay?

01:23:19.761 --> 01:23:21.661
But the fact of the matter is
that there's not one person

01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:23.527
that I know that you trust
enough to let close enough

01:23:23.598 --> 01:23:24.622
that they could hurt you.

01:23:24.699 --> 01:23:28.567
And her big problem
is that you really liked her.

01:23:28.636 --> 01:23:31.264
I mean, she is the one girl
you really liked.

01:23:31.373 --> 01:23:33.238
And no matter what she did
and how hard she tried,

01:23:33.308 --> 01:23:35.435
you were never gonna
let your guard down.

01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:37.705
That poor girl
never stood a chance.

01:24:16.317 --> 01:24:17.306
Marilyn?

01:24:20.722 --> 01:24:22.690
Marilyn?
Yeah.

01:24:26.995 --> 01:24:31.329
I'm sorry. I just...

01:24:31.933 --> 01:24:33.093
Oh, just get in here.

01:24:33.168 --> 01:24:35.398
Oh, okay.
I'm sorry, excuse me.

01:24:36.337 --> 01:24:37.770
Marilyn, I just...

01:24:37.839 --> 01:24:41.366
I just wanted to let you know
that today is gonna be my last day.

01:24:43.978 --> 01:24:46.310
I'm gonna be traveling
for a bit.

01:24:55.890 --> 01:24:57.380
Here's a blank check.

01:24:57.459 --> 01:25:01.395
Write down a number, I don't want to
know what it is, and go back to work.

01:25:01.529 --> 01:25:03.895
No, no. It's not about that.

01:25:05.433 --> 01:25:06.923
I can't accept that.

01:25:08.369 --> 01:25:09.393
Brooke.

01:25:10.605 --> 01:25:13.165
Travis, get your gorgeous
tuckus out of here.

01:25:21.749 --> 01:25:24.013
If you make it to Rome,

01:25:24.285 --> 01:25:28.153
search out an establishment
called the Padre Negro.

01:25:28.456 --> 01:25:32.256
Ask for a strapping young
fellow named Alberto.

01:25:33.094 --> 01:25:35.085
Compliments of M. Dean.

01:25:38.166 --> 01:25:41.101
Well, thank you.
I appreciate that.

01:25:41.336 --> 01:25:43.896
Yeah. And, honey,

01:25:45.073 --> 01:25:47.667
take as long as you want,
because when you're done,

01:25:47.742 --> 01:25:50.302
your job will be right here
waiting for you.

01:25:51.412 --> 01:25:55.473
And if you discover a path
that doesn't lead back here...

01:25:56.618 --> 01:25:58.552
Well, I hope you'll text.

01:26:01.789 --> 01:26:03.051
I will.

01:26:13.034 --> 01:26:16.299
And, like I said, the apartment's
a mess, but I'm moving, so...

01:26:16.371 --> 01:26:19.067
It's okay. Relax about
the place. I don't care.

01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:21.540
Okay. This'll just take a second. Okay.

01:26:28.049 --> 01:26:31.678
Hello?
Hey. I'm in here.

01:26:39.127 --> 01:26:41.425
Don't say anything. I...

01:26:42.597 --> 01:26:44.121
How're you doing?

01:26:50.838 --> 01:26:53.363
Could I talk to you in private
for a second?

01:26:56.044 --> 01:26:58.274
You know what? This is
really not a good time,

01:26:58.346 --> 01:27:00.871
and obviously you have
something happening here,

01:27:00.949 --> 01:27:03.349
so we'll just be in... No, no,
I don't have anything going on.

01:27:03.418 --> 01:27:05.716
This is actually for you.

01:27:08.122 --> 01:27:10.454
I'm just gonna wait outside.
No, no. Wait.

01:27:10.525 --> 01:27:12.550
No, no. Really. It's okay.

01:27:15.330 --> 01:27:17.389
I really can't do this
right now.

01:27:17.465 --> 01:27:20.366
Brooke, this whole thing
has been really tough on me

01:27:20.868 --> 01:27:23.803
and I've tried to act like it
hasn't been that tough on me,

01:27:23.871 --> 01:27:26.567
but the first Sunday
after me and you broke up,

01:27:26.674 --> 01:27:28.665
it all kind of really hit me.

01:27:29.210 --> 01:27:30.643
And I think
it partially hit me

01:27:30.712 --> 01:27:34.148
because Sunday was sort of always our
day that we would do stuff together.

01:27:34.215 --> 01:27:37.844
But I didn't have any idea
you still cared so much.

01:27:38.886 --> 01:27:42.049
And, you know, when I saw
you crying the other night,

01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:45.416
that was honestly
the worst moment of my life.

01:27:47.662 --> 01:27:48.686
Gary.

01:27:48.763 --> 01:27:52.130
Let me just try to say some of
these things here. It's just...

01:27:52.634 --> 01:27:53.828
Look,

01:27:55.336 --> 01:27:58.931
I know that I've caused you
a lot of pain.

01:28:00.408 --> 01:28:04.367
And the funny thing is, all I
really want to do is make you happy.

01:28:05.413 --> 01:28:07.313
I just want to make you smile.

01:28:07.382 --> 01:28:10.374
Now, I've had a lot of time to
think about some of the things

01:28:10.451 --> 01:28:13.682
that went on, and I know, Brooke,
that I don't always do the right thing

01:28:13.755 --> 01:28:15.723
or always say
the right things,

01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:18.588
but I am willing to try
to do things differently.

01:28:18.793 --> 01:28:21.284
And I'd be happy to go
take a dance class.

01:28:21.396 --> 01:28:24.957
Well, I would. Honestly. I would
like to go do that. Or go travel.

01:28:25.099 --> 01:28:27.761
I mean, I'd even be willing
to go to the ballet.

01:28:27.835 --> 01:28:32.772
Although I would much rather do the
dance class or take a trip somewhere.

01:28:33.107 --> 01:28:34.768
But I realize
that's not the point.

01:28:34.842 --> 01:28:36.969
I realize that the point
isn't that at all,

01:28:37.045 --> 01:28:41.141
because it's not really about doing
things that you love to do always,

01:28:41.215 --> 01:28:44.810
but it is about doing things
with the person that you love.

01:28:45.687 --> 01:28:47.814
And I love you.

01:28:51.359 --> 01:28:54.260
Gary.
Just give me one second here.

01:28:55.463 --> 01:28:57.328
I've missed you so much.

01:29:00.601 --> 01:29:02.091
I promise you, Brooke,

01:29:02.170 --> 01:29:06.573
I will do whatever it is that I
have to do to never hurt you again.

01:29:07.508 --> 01:29:11.376
I love you and I'm sorry.

01:29:15.083 --> 01:29:17.176
Okay, that's it.
That's all I...

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:20.683
Oh, God.
That's all I wanted to say,

01:29:20.755 --> 01:29:24.316
so you can go ahead now with
anything that you're feeling to say.

01:29:27.829 --> 01:29:29.558
I don't know what to say.

01:29:30.665 --> 01:29:32.860
Just say whatever
you feel inside.

01:29:40.641 --> 01:29:42.905
I don't feel the same way.

01:29:47.315 --> 01:29:49.783
I don't. I just...
I don't know.

01:29:50.852 --> 01:29:52.149
Oh, God.

01:29:54.355 --> 01:29:57.381
I just, I think...
I don't know,

01:29:57.458 --> 01:29:59.653
but I don't think I have

01:30:00.128 --> 01:30:03.757
anything left to give.

01:30:06.367 --> 01:30:07.766
I'm sorry.

01:30:14.909 --> 01:30:16.740
I was hoping for...

01:30:21.282 --> 01:30:22.681
It doesn't matter.

01:30:28.523 --> 01:30:30.718
Oh, this is now
beyond awkward.

01:30:30.792 --> 01:30:33.590
There's some new guy
standing out in the hallway

01:30:33.661 --> 01:30:37.597
and I think I'm gonna go.

01:30:42.537 --> 01:30:43.731
Okay.

01:30:47.442 --> 01:30:48.909
Thank you.

01:30:52.647 --> 01:30:55.377
I made a dinner, and I don't
know if it's any good or not,

01:30:55.450 --> 01:30:57.384
but you're welcome to have it.

01:30:58.719 --> 01:30:59.811
Okay.

01:31:04.692 --> 01:31:07.388
Gary, that's really... That's
not what you think that it is.

01:31:07.462 --> 01:31:08.588
It's okay.

01:31:10.031 --> 01:31:11.931
I'm gonna go take a walk.

01:31:36.357 --> 01:31:38.621
I'm sorry about that.
No.

01:31:38.926 --> 01:31:42.225
I'm sorry I imposed.
No, that's fine. Please.

01:31:43.865 --> 01:31:47.733
So, what do you think?
I think you're right.

01:31:47.802 --> 01:31:50.134
I think it's great.
Good.

01:31:50.838 --> 01:31:52.430
Okay.
Okay.

01:31:52.507 --> 01:31:53.633
So,

01:31:55.409 --> 01:31:58.469
I will have that wrapped up.

01:31:58.546 --> 01:32:01.276
Packed up, sorry,
and delivered.

01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:04.083
Thank you for taking the time
to show it to me, okay?

01:32:04.151 --> 01:32:05.277
Sure.

01:32:05.486 --> 01:32:08.011
Yeah. I'm gonna run.
Okay, I'll walk you out.

01:32:08.089 --> 01:32:10.421
No, no, no.
I can... It's okay.

01:32:24.438 --> 01:32:27.498
So, the thing that I was most
afraid of happening happened

01:32:27.575 --> 01:32:32.103
and I don't regret it at all,
because now she knows how I feel.

01:32:34.415 --> 01:32:37.145
Do you know what I mean?
Yeah.

01:32:37.218 --> 01:32:41.416
I think, what you got to
do now is really think hard,

01:32:42.490 --> 01:32:44.583
because you have
to find somebody

01:32:45.660 --> 01:32:48.128
that can't be traced back
to either of us

01:32:49.397 --> 01:32:51.092
to visit this guy.

01:32:51.532 --> 01:32:53.659
What are you talking about?
I don't...

01:32:53.734 --> 01:32:55.463
The guy who came with her.

01:32:55.536 --> 01:32:57.970
I don't need anything
to happen to the guy.

01:32:58.039 --> 01:32:59.700
But if they could trace him
back to either one of us...

01:32:59.774 --> 01:33:01.901
It's not about him. I don't care
about that. ... it's a problem.

01:33:01.976 --> 01:33:04.570
The guy, he's not a... They're
not dumb. Cops are smart, trust me.

01:33:04.645 --> 01:33:06.579
Okay, but he's not a
problem to me. Right.

01:33:06.647 --> 01:33:08.444
Listen to me.

01:33:08.516 --> 01:33:11.952
Promise me that you're
not gonna do anything.

01:33:12.019 --> 01:33:13.111
I got you.

01:33:13.788 --> 01:33:16.154
It's better if nobody...
You don't know anything.

01:33:16.223 --> 01:33:17.713
What are you talking about?
I'll take care of it.

01:33:17.792 --> 01:33:19.783
I don't want you to take care
of anything. John, do me a favor.

01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:22.886
I'm being serious with you. I
know, I know. Smart. You're smart.

01:33:22.964 --> 01:33:24.295
No, I'm not.
I'm being honest with you.

01:33:24.365 --> 01:33:25.764
I don't want anything to
happen to him. Me, either.

01:33:25.833 --> 01:33:27.892
Promise me you're not gonna have
anyone do anything to this guy.

01:33:27.969 --> 01:33:29.869
But you've gotta tell me exactly
what you're gonna tell them,

01:33:29.937 --> 01:33:31.837
if the cops come to you. Because
if we tell a different story...

01:33:31.906 --> 01:33:33.703
Nothing. Promise me one
thing. We don't care...

01:33:33.774 --> 01:33:35.765
John, I'm gonna go home. I
can't do this. I'm exhausted.

01:33:35.843 --> 01:33:38.175
Right, go home. Just make sure your
neighbors know you're going home.

01:33:38.245 --> 01:33:41.942
Do me a favor. They got phone records.
Make a couple phone calls tonight.

01:33:42.016 --> 01:33:43.745
Especially around 10:00.

01:33:44.652 --> 01:33:47.143
Okay. Please don't
do anything. All right.

01:33:47.221 --> 01:33:48.882
I don't mean it like...
I mean, honestly.

01:33:48.956 --> 01:33:50.321
No, no, I got it.

01:33:54.862 --> 01:33:57.160
For all you know,
nothing's happening.

01:33:57.665 --> 01:33:59.997
I don't want anything to happen. Right.

01:34:00.067 --> 01:34:01.432
Say it louder.

01:35:30.424 --> 01:35:32.517
What are you doing here
so early?

01:35:55.082 --> 01:35:56.106
Hey.

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:02.585
Everything okay with you and...
Yeah, everything's gonna be great.

01:36:02.656 --> 01:36:07.116
I just wanna get my day started,
but I just wanted to say that

01:36:07.962 --> 01:36:10.692
I'm sorry it took
so long for me to...

01:36:12.399 --> 01:36:13.832
I love you, Dennis.

01:36:15.803 --> 01:36:18.033
It's all right. It's okay.

01:36:19.673 --> 01:36:22.540
I'm sorry. I'm gonna go
do the stuff.

01:36:49.136 --> 01:36:51.161
So, that's it
for all my stuff.

01:36:54.275 --> 01:36:58.371
If you want, you could give me your
key and I'll drop it off at Riggleman's.

01:36:58.846 --> 01:37:00.108
All right.

01:37:09.456 --> 01:37:10.650
Thanks.

01:37:11.826 --> 01:37:12.815
Gary.

01:37:13.727 --> 01:37:17.219
You know, there's
a thousand things I...

01:37:18.232 --> 01:37:20.200
I would have done differently.

01:37:22.369 --> 01:37:23.563
Me, too.

01:37:25.606 --> 01:37:30.066
Sort of, actually, when I see this
space, I realize that if we didn't have

01:37:30.144 --> 01:37:33.944
such a big coffee table
and that oversized couch

01:37:35.316 --> 01:37:39.776
a pool table
would have fit nicely.

01:37:39.954 --> 01:37:41.046
Yeah.

01:37:41.889 --> 01:37:46.849
Although the oversized couch did come in
very useful the last couple of weeks, so...

01:37:47.027 --> 01:37:48.688
Yes, it... I guess.

01:37:54.635 --> 01:37:56.000
Have a good trip.

01:37:58.405 --> 01:37:59.702
Thanks.

01:38:09.450 --> 01:38:11.645
<i>Chicago is called
the Second City</i>

01:38:11.719 --> 01:38:14.950
<i>because after the
Great Chicago Fire of 1871,</i>

01:38:15.022 --> 01:38:16.751
<i>Chicago was rebuilt
on its ruins.</i>

01:38:16.824 --> 01:38:20.521
<i>The city came back even bigger and

01:38:20.594 --> 01:38:24.553
<i>So it's not really an insult, it's
more of a badge of honor to be called...</i>

01:38:25.299 --> 01:38:26.789
The Second City!

01:38:27.735 --> 01:38:29.362
<i>Okay. People, you might
be able to get away</i>

01:38:29.436 --> 01:38:31.802

01:38:35.242 --> 01:38:37.107

01:38:37.177 --> 01:38:39.372
<i>Do not make me ask you twice.</i>

01:38:39.847 --> 01:38:42.042
<i>Are you ready to see Chicago?
Yes!</i>

01:38:42.116 --> 01:38:44.311
<i>I said, are you ready
to see Chicago? Yes!</i>

01:38:44.385 --> 01:38:48.685
<i>Are you ready to see Chicago?
Shondra, put this babe in the air.</i>

01:38:48.756 --> 01:38:49.780
<i>Let's go!</i>

01:38:50.257 --> 01:38:52.919
<i>There is a bar downstairs.
Please enjoy yourself.</i>

01:38:52.993 --> 01:38:55.120
<i>I know it's early in the morning,
but it is Chicago in the summer.</i>

01:38:55.195 --> 01:38:56.321
<i>Who are we kidding? It's fine.</i>

01:38:56.397 --> 01:38:58.228
<i>Go get hopped up,
make some bad decisions.</i>

01:38:58.299 --> 01:39:00.460
<i>My jokes get better.
The buildings look bigger.</i>

01:39:20.187 --> 01:39:22.985
It's not so important
that everything is finished.

01:39:23.057 --> 01:39:25.457
It's important that
everything is right.

01:39:25.559 --> 01:39:27.720
Well, what time's
the presentation?

01:39:27.861 --> 01:39:30.625
All right, I'll pick up the rest of
the stuff and I'll see you at 6:45.

01:39:30.698 --> 01:39:32.256
Great. Bye.

01:39:32.733 --> 01:39:33.961
Brooke!

01:39:39.573 --> 01:39:42.371
Hi.
Hi.

01:39:43.978 --> 01:39:45.172
Wow.

01:39:47.214 --> 01:39:50.115
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you.

01:39:50.284 --> 01:39:54.550
I'd give you a hug, but my hands are
kind of full with all the bags here.

01:39:56.957 --> 01:39:59.289
How've you been?
I've been really good.

01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:01.828
How have you been?
I've been good.

01:40:02.429 --> 01:40:03.691
Yeah.

01:40:04.832 --> 01:40:06.697
You look great.
Thank you.

01:40:06.767 --> 01:40:10.066
The hair's a little different.
Looks nice. Yeah? Oh, yeah.

01:40:11.005 --> 01:40:14.600
You've lost some weight. Well,
it's very deceiving, actually.

01:40:14.675 --> 01:40:19.510
I've managed to become thin without
having any real muscle on me whatsoever.

01:40:19.613 --> 01:40:22.878
Very tough thing to accomplish,
by the way. I'm proud of myself.

01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:25.441
Well, you look terrific.
Thanks.

01:40:26.553 --> 01:40:29.954
I heard your trip went really
well. It did. It went really well.

01:40:30.024 --> 01:40:31.616
Oh, good.
It was fun. It was amazing.

01:40:31.692 --> 01:40:34.252
I saw so many amazing places.
It was just...

01:40:34.628 --> 01:40:38.826
But, you know, you do realize
how much you love home.

01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:42.936
It's good to have you back.
Yeah. It's good to be back.

01:40:45.773 --> 01:40:48.799
And the boat. Congratulations
on the boat. Thanks.

01:40:48.909 --> 01:40:51.776
I'm waiting for it to get warm, and
I'm gonna come by and take a ride.

01:40:51.845 --> 01:40:54.678
Well, anytime you want. It'll
be on the house. Come on by.

01:40:54.748 --> 01:40:56.807
Well, I will, then.

01:40:58.252 --> 01:40:59.742
I hope you do.

01:41:01.088 --> 01:41:02.248
Definitely.

01:41:06.293 --> 01:41:09.126
Well, I got to...
I'm going to a meeting, so...

01:41:09.196 --> 01:41:13.997
I got to drop these bags off anyway,
but it's really good to see you, Brooke.

01:41:14.401 --> 01:41:17.029
Really good to see you.
Shouldn't...

01:41:17.838 --> 01:41:19.271
Sorry.
I'm sorry.

01:41:19.339 --> 01:41:22.706
I'm just saying we shouldn't wait
so long the next time before we...

01:41:22.776 --> 01:41:24.141
Yeah.
... catch up.

01:41:24.211 --> 01:41:26.611
We have a lot more to talk about. Yeah.

01:41:27.014 --> 01:41:28.003
So.

01:41:29.349 --> 01:41:30.976
Be good.
Okay.

01:41:31.051 --> 01:41:32.245
Bye.
Bye.
