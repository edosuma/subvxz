Previously
on a very special part one

00:05.567 --> 00:07.833
of a very special
two-part season finale

00:07.833 --> 00:09.800
of Clone High...

00:09.800 --> 00:11.267
Makeover.

00:11.267 --> 00:13.900
You look like an angel.

00:13.900 --> 00:16.633
I can't wait
for some serious dry humping.

00:16.633 --> 00:18.433
I already have a date--

00:18.433 --> 00:20.133
Rock Hudson.

00:20.133 --> 00:22.900
Staaaaag!

00:22.900 --> 00:24.900
Scudworth, we're going
to take the clones away

00:24.900 --> 00:25.933
and terminate you.

00:25.933 --> 00:27.533
Ah! Ah!

00:27.533 --> 00:28.767
Oh, oh!

00:28.767 --> 00:32.200
Will you go
to the prom with me...

00:32.200 --> 00:34.100
[inhales]

00:34.100 --> 00:35.633
Jo-Cle--

00:35.633 --> 00:37.733
(narrator)
Tonight everything
you thought was real

00:37.733 --> 00:39.367
comes down to this.

00:39.367 --> 00:41.433
Old questions
will be answered,

00:41.433 --> 00:43.633
and new answers
will be questioned

00:43.633 --> 00:45.300
on an episode we call...

00:45.300 --> 00:48.067
[people shrieking]

00:48.067 --> 00:49.633
"Changes."

00:49.633 --> 00:52.467
(Abandoned Pools singing)
* Way, way back in the 1980s

00:52.467 --> 00:55.400
* Secret government employees

00:55.400 --> 00:58.300
* Dug up famous
guys and ladies *

00:58.300 --> 01:01.400
* And made amusing
genetic copies *

01:01.400 --> 01:04.200
* Now the clones
are sexy teens now *

01:04.200 --> 01:07.067
* They're gonna make it
if they try *

01:07.067 --> 01:09.933
* Loving, learning,
sharing, judging *

01:09.933 --> 01:16.267
* Time to laugh
and shiver and cry *

01:16.267 --> 01:19.067
* Clone High

01:19.067 --> 01:24.133
* Clone High

01:24.133 --> 01:25.367
[people shrieking]

01:27.067 --> 01:29.467
Will you go to the prom
with me...

01:32.700 --> 01:34.067
Jo-Cle--
[clears throat]

01:34.067 --> 01:35.067
Excuse me.

01:35.067 --> 01:36.233
Got a tickle.

01:36.233 --> 01:38.500
Will you go
to the prom with me?

01:42.200 --> 01:44.900
Jo...king aside,

01:44.900 --> 01:46.500
will you be my prom date...

01:48.400 --> 01:49.733
Cleo?

01:49.733 --> 01:50.867
Yes!

01:50.867 --> 01:52.600
Of course
I'll go with you.

01:52.600 --> 01:54.067
And it doesn't matter
that you gave me

01:54.067 --> 01:55.200
a half-assed prom-posal.

01:57.300 --> 02:00.400
This prom is so going to be
the best night of our lives.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.633
The theme
is totally kick-ass:

02:02.633 --> 02:05.367
A Magical Night
in the Meat Locker.

02:05.367 --> 02:06.900
The gym's closed
for repairs.

02:06.900 --> 02:09.767
Oh, someone wore
black-soled shoes again?

02:09.767 --> 02:11.533
Yes.

02:14.333 --> 02:15.800
[chuckles nervously]

02:20.233 --> 02:21.933
Where--where am I?

02:21.933 --> 02:25.733
Oh, Wesley, I'm afraid
you have amnesia.

02:25.733 --> 02:27.967
Was I doing dishes?

02:27.967 --> 02:29.933
You're the evil principal
of a high school

02:29.933 --> 02:33.600
populated by teenaged clones
of historical figures.

02:33.600 --> 02:35.600
A clone high school?

02:35.600 --> 02:37.433
Oh, what a cute idea!

02:37.433 --> 02:39.900
Anyhoo, TV personality
John Stamos

02:39.900 --> 02:41.733
called to rub it in
how he beat you out

02:41.733 --> 02:44.433
for prom king
when you were in high school.

02:44.433 --> 02:45.700
Stamos!

02:45.700 --> 02:48.167
So I made you over
like a French dandy...

02:48.167 --> 02:49.700
Stamos!

02:49.700 --> 02:52.600
Which inspired you to run
for this year's prom king.

02:52.600 --> 02:55.800
Well, it seems my memory
is now completely restored,

02:55.800 --> 02:58.300
except for whatever happened
moments before I fainted.

03:00.767 --> 03:02.567
We're coming
to collect the clones

03:02.567 --> 03:04.533
and terminate you...

03:04.533 --> 03:06.067
on prom night.

03:08.767 --> 03:11.233
But how important
can that be?

03:11.233 --> 03:15.500
Y-yeah, yeah.

03:15.500 --> 03:17.133
(Abe)
Foster dad,

03:17.133 --> 03:19.533
can I talk to you
about something?

03:19.533 --> 03:21.600
Sure, foster son.
What's on your mind?

03:21.600 --> 03:23.267
Well...

03:23.267 --> 03:27.333
I'm kind of nervous
about...you know.

03:27.333 --> 03:28.333
Oh.

03:28.333 --> 03:31.200
Cleo sort of wants to...

03:31.200 --> 03:33.200
but I just don't know
if I'm ready.

03:33.200 --> 03:34.533
Well, foster son,

03:34.533 --> 03:36.633
over half of high school
students nationwide

03:36.633 --> 03:38.167
have chosen abstinence,

03:38.167 --> 03:39.733
which is a good choice.

03:39.733 --> 03:43.500
But they're not dating
Cleo-friggin'-patra!

03:43.500 --> 03:45.500
Have you seen
that girl's ass?

03:45.500 --> 03:46.900
It's built
like the space shuttle!

03:46.900 --> 03:48.167
Ooh, this could be

03:48.167 --> 03:50.067
your only chance
to drown the slippery otter,

03:50.067 --> 03:52.067
to harpoon
the salty longshoreman,

03:52.067 --> 03:54.067
to verb the adjective noun!

03:56.400 --> 03:58.933
But abstinence
is a good choice as well.

04:02.133 --> 04:03.767
[sighs]

04:03.767 --> 04:08.233
Oh, Carver, van Gogh,
Nostradamus, and...others,

04:08.233 --> 04:09.533
if I hadn't been such a jerk,

04:09.533 --> 04:11.900
I could be dry humping
Marie Curie at prom

04:11.900 --> 04:13.333
instead of going...

04:13.333 --> 04:18.800
staaaaag!

04:18.800 --> 04:21.300
Well, it's not like
any of us have dates.

04:21.300 --> 04:22.400
[snorts]

04:22.400 --> 04:24.867
[gasps]
Gentlemen, check this out!

04:24.867 --> 04:27.467
We'll form a prom posse!

04:30.067 --> 04:31.300
Okay, check this out.

04:31.300 --> 04:33.300
We roll up ten deep
in a double-wide Winnie.

04:33.300 --> 04:35.467
Ten dudes
with matching white tuxes,

04:35.467 --> 04:37.067
tennis shoes for attitude,

04:37.067 --> 04:40.300
and we leave with 100 ladies!

04:40.300 --> 04:41.800
Do the math, gentlemen.

04:43.267 --> 04:46.067
That's ten ladies each.

04:46.067 --> 04:47.567
I mean, who needs
Marie Curie

04:47.567 --> 04:49.200
and her handsome date,
Rock Hudson,

04:49.200 --> 04:52.300
when we can dry hump
whoever we want?

04:52.300 --> 04:55.100
Prom posse! Ow!

04:55.100 --> 04:56.800
(man)
That's Joan.

04:56.800 --> 04:58.567
(man)
By the beard of Zeus.

04:58.567 --> 04:59.800
(woman)
What a fox.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.433
(man)
Is it clichÃ© to say,
"Hubba, hubba"?

05:01.433 --> 05:02.433
[gasps]
[dull thud]

05:02.433 --> 05:04.567
Oof!

05:04.567 --> 05:07.233
My Kennedy sense
is tingling.

05:07.233 --> 05:08.867
Here's how it is.

05:08.867 --> 05:11.200
Inasmuch as I'm very popular
and you're very good-looking,

05:11.200 --> 05:12.867
I'm gonna ask you
to the prom now,

05:12.867 --> 05:14.300
and you will
obviously say yes.

05:14.300 --> 05:15.300
smack!

05:15.300 --> 05:16.600
- No.
- Okay.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.067
I'm just a shy lad,

05:18.067 --> 05:19.767
and I don't know
how to ask this,

05:19.767 --> 05:22.100
but will you go
to the prom with me?

05:22.100 --> 05:23.100
smack!

05:23.100 --> 05:24.333
Ooh!

05:24.333 --> 05:26.233
I'm waiting for someone
special to ask me,

05:26.233 --> 05:27.600
someone more like--

05:27.600 --> 05:28.600
Abe!

05:28.600 --> 05:30.233
Joan, Joan.

05:30.233 --> 05:34.167
I have a very special
prom question to ask you.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.300
Oof!
[dull thud]

05:35.300 --> 05:36.300
[clears throat]

05:36.300 --> 05:37.500
Uh, yes, Abe?

05:37.500 --> 05:40.833
I asked Cleo to the prom,
and she said yes!

05:40.833 --> 05:43.600
I-I just--

05:43.600 --> 05:44.967
How is that a question?

05:44.967 --> 05:48.067
Well, Cleo wants
to have S-E-X on prom night,

05:48.067 --> 05:49.367
but I'm really nervous.

05:49.367 --> 05:50.500
And I need some information

05:50.500 --> 05:52.067
so I can make
an informed decision.

05:52.067 --> 05:54.567
Do girls' parts need
some sort of oil or equipment,

05:54.567 --> 05:56.100
like cotton balls
or wooden dowels?

05:56.100 --> 05:57.400
Ugh!

05:57.400 --> 06:01.133
Why do guys always go
for giggly, vapid sluts?

06:01.133 --> 06:04.500
Hark, I just heard a word
that starts with an S,

06:04.500 --> 06:07.900
ends with an S,
and has a lut inside...

06:07.900 --> 06:09.767
a lut of me!

06:13.100 --> 06:14.100
[laughs]

06:14.100 --> 06:16.900
JFK, you are so funny.

06:16.900 --> 06:19.667
I am so glad
we're going to prom together.

06:19.667 --> 06:21.067
But you said no.

06:21.067 --> 06:22.600
Oh.
[giggles]

06:22.600 --> 06:24.167
As a giggly, vapid slut,

06:24.167 --> 06:26.633
I get so confused.

06:26.633 --> 06:27.767
[giggles]

06:27.767 --> 06:29.467
You and JFK, huh?

06:29.467 --> 06:31.700
[giggles]

06:31.700 --> 06:32.900
That's cool.

06:32.900 --> 06:36.400
I'm so...
psyched for you guys.

06:36.400 --> 06:39.333
[Joan giggling]

06:41.533 --> 06:43.867
Well, I'm off to buy
some condoms.

06:48.967 --> 06:52.400
[hard rock music]

06:52.400 --> 06:55.067
(shadowy figure)
Board of shadowy figures,
fellow conspirators,

06:55.067 --> 06:56.433
and celebrity guests,

06:56.433 --> 06:58.767
our clones shall finally
return home.

06:58.767 --> 07:03.567
And upon their return,
we shall commence phase two.

07:03.567 --> 07:05.233
[laughing wickedly]

07:05.233 --> 07:06.233
Oh.

07:06.233 --> 07:07.667
Did everybody do pee-pees?

07:07.667 --> 07:08.933
I don't want to pull over
every five minutes.

07:08.933 --> 07:11.067
[rapid footsteps]

07:11.067 --> 07:12.833
[toilets flushing]

07:12.833 --> 07:16.233
Let us ride!

07:16.233 --> 07:17.800
What do you think, Toots?

07:17.800 --> 07:19.900
Now, I may be blind,

07:19.900 --> 07:22.067
but I can still feel
when my foster granddaughter

07:22.067 --> 07:23.567
is ready for the prom.

07:23.567 --> 07:25.433
Mm-mm-mm, Joanie, Joanie.
Whoa.

07:25.433 --> 07:27.600
Little bit of acne
there, girl.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.467
[doorbell rings]

07:29.467 --> 07:31.267
Hey, Joan,
you look beaut--

07:31.267 --> 07:32.633
Hey, baby.

07:32.633 --> 07:34.633
Oh, hi, Kennedy.

07:34.633 --> 07:36.567
Want a corsage?

07:36.567 --> 07:39.933
'Cause I got
a delicate flower for you...

07:39.933 --> 07:42.133
in my pants!

07:45.300 --> 07:46.733
[giggles]

07:46.733 --> 07:50.467
Oh, JFK,
you are so funny.

07:50.467 --> 07:51.733
Now let's get
you all together

07:51.733 --> 07:53.367
for a little picture.

07:53.367 --> 07:56.333
Stay away from Abe,
of Arc,

07:56.333 --> 07:58.133
or you'll pay.

07:58.133 --> 07:59.300
Pay what?

08:01.600 --> 08:03.467
Okay, I hadn't thought
that far.

08:04.700 --> 08:06.667
Well, there's
a double feature playing

08:06.667 --> 08:09.100
down at the silent movie
theater.

08:09.100 --> 08:10.900
Where are my keys at?

08:10.900 --> 08:12.633
Brother done lost his keys.

08:12.633 --> 08:13.800
[giggles]

08:13.800 --> 08:15.867
I'll see you
at prom, Abe.

08:15.867 --> 08:17.233
Yeah.

08:17.233 --> 08:19.400
See you at prom.

08:19.400 --> 08:21.067
Have fun at the prom,
Joanie.

08:21.067 --> 08:23.100
[ball bouncing]

08:23.100 --> 08:24.067
[dull thud]

08:26.567 --> 08:28.367
[chuckles]
Hi.

08:28.367 --> 08:29.700
Uh, who are they?

08:29.700 --> 08:31.133
Oh, uh,
they're my other dates,

08:31.133 --> 08:33.733
Catherine the Great
and the Bronte sisters.

08:33.733 --> 08:35.467
What the--

08:35.467 --> 08:36.800
Oh.
[giggles]

08:36.800 --> 08:39.367
Oh, JFK, you're so funny.

08:39.367 --> 08:41.067
[both laughing]

08:41.067 --> 08:42.067
[grumbles]

08:42.067 --> 08:43.633
Yeah.

08:43.633 --> 08:45.267
Gentlemen, check this out!

08:45.267 --> 08:48.533
I got my head stickin' outside
this vehicle's sunroof

08:48.533 --> 08:49.733
as it's driving.

08:49.733 --> 08:52.667
I bet no one's ever
thought of this.

08:52.667 --> 08:54.933
(all)
Best night of our lives!

08:54.933 --> 08:55.867
Ow!

09:01.767 --> 09:06.433
(Gandhi)
Wow, this is the meat locker?

09:06.433 --> 09:08.067
So are you nervous?

09:08.067 --> 09:09.767
Pshh,
About what?

09:09.767 --> 09:12.767
You know, S-E-X.

09:12.767 --> 09:16.733
Abe, I like my humpin'
like I like my martinis...

09:16.733 --> 09:18.367
dry.

09:18.367 --> 09:20.700
Nerves barely even
enter into it.

09:20.700 --> 09:22.100
Right.

09:22.100 --> 09:24.333
I'm definitely not nervous
about sleeping with Joan.

09:24.333 --> 09:25.667
Uh, Cleo?

09:25.667 --> 09:27.567
- Who?
- What?

09:27.567 --> 09:32.067
(shadowy figure)
Seriously, that is the last time
we stop for wee-wees.

09:32.067 --> 09:35.433
If you have to go,
use the ashtray.

09:35.433 --> 09:38.233
[slow rock music playing]

09:38.233 --> 09:40.400
This is so awesome, Abe.

09:40.400 --> 09:42.600
I mean, the winter prom.

09:42.600 --> 09:44.900
This is supposed to be
the best night of our lives,

09:44.900 --> 09:45.900
and it is.

09:45.900 --> 09:47.600
Yeah, Joan looks
great tonight.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.133
Check this out.

09:49.133 --> 09:50.367
Hoo-yo.

09:50.367 --> 09:53.367
[both laughing]

09:53.367 --> 09:56.467
You know, Abe, I'm having
such a magical night

09:56.467 --> 09:58.200
in the meat locker.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.700
And I can't wait to see
the magical meat

10:00.700 --> 10:02.867
in your locker.

10:02.867 --> 10:04.200
Cleo,

10:04.200 --> 10:06.033
our lockers
are back at school and--

10:06.033 --> 10:07.467
[whispering]

10:07.467 --> 10:08.867
[chuckles nervously]

10:08.867 --> 10:11.767
Hey, ladies,
who wants some G. Love?

10:11.767 --> 10:15.033
Hold the Special Sauce.

10:15.033 --> 10:16.033
Ow.

10:17.600 --> 10:19.000
Oh, hi, Marie.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.900
Hi, Gandhi.

10:20.900 --> 10:23.500
So...you having fun?

10:23.500 --> 10:26.533
Sure, best night
of my life, man.

10:26.533 --> 10:28.833
How's your handsome date,
Rock Hudson?

10:28.833 --> 10:32.533
Oh, he's off teaching
Oscar Wilde to play pool.

10:32.533 --> 10:37.867
Mr. B, they're about to announce
the king of the prom.

10:37.867 --> 10:39.900
And I don't need
to remind you,

10:39.900 --> 10:42.733
I've rigged the election.

10:42.733 --> 10:45.300
But I did remind you.

10:45.300 --> 10:46.800
Well, what's done is done.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.000
Mm.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.100
[clears throat]

10:49.100 --> 10:50.967
I have reached a verdict.

10:53.667 --> 10:59.500
Your new Clone High prom king
is Principal...

10:59.500 --> 11:01.300
I hope it's me.
I hope it's me.

11:01.300 --> 11:03.200
Scudw...

11:03.200 --> 11:04.767
I hope it's me.
I hope it's me.

11:04.767 --> 11:06.933
Wait a minute.

11:06.933 --> 11:08.633
Is that John Stamos?

11:08.633 --> 11:10.333
[gasps]
No.

11:10.333 --> 11:11.867
John Stamos?

11:11.867 --> 11:14.800
The hunky, hazel-eyed star
of Full House?

11:14.800 --> 11:15.800
[gasps]

11:15.800 --> 11:17.933
There has been an error.

11:17.933 --> 11:20.667
Stamos is your prom king!

11:20.667 --> 11:23.533
[chuckles]
Whoa, whoa, you guys.

11:23.533 --> 11:24.567
Stop it.

11:24.567 --> 11:25.700
Thank you.

11:25.700 --> 11:26.967
I was just stopping by
to say hi

11:26.967 --> 11:29.533
to my old pal Scudworth, and--
wow, this.

11:29.533 --> 11:31.500
You guys are really too cool.
Really.

11:31.500 --> 11:34.100
Thank you.
[chuckles]

11:34.100 --> 11:36.733
Hey, how's your night?

11:36.733 --> 11:37.733
[giggles]

11:37.733 --> 11:38.733
Oh, Abe.

11:38.733 --> 11:40.067
You're so funny.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.900
I guess that was pretty funny,

11:41.900 --> 11:44.067
askin' about your night.

11:44.067 --> 11:47.533
Joan, you seem so much
more approachable lately.

11:47.533 --> 11:49.900
And it's made me
want to tell you something,

11:49.900 --> 11:51.600
a very special something

11:51.600 --> 11:53.267
that you've probably
been wanting to hear

11:53.267 --> 11:54.467
for some time now.

11:54.467 --> 11:55.733
Really, Abe?

11:55.733 --> 11:58.300
Something you no doubt
pine for so deeply

11:58.300 --> 11:59.767
that my hinting at what it is

11:59.767 --> 12:01.667
only increases your anticipation

12:01.667 --> 12:04.133
and nearly guarantees
your imminent joy.

12:04.133 --> 12:05.933
Oh, boy,
here it comes.

12:05.933 --> 12:07.567
- Joan...
- Yes?

12:07.567 --> 12:09.933
Your date, JFK,

12:09.933 --> 12:11.333
he's a lucky guy tonight.

12:11.333 --> 12:13.167
You know what, Abe?
I am tired of your--

12:13.167 --> 12:14.900
You've--
What? Huh?

12:14.900 --> 12:16.867
Um, I don't--
I don't know what to say.

12:16.867 --> 12:18.933
Don't say anything,
Joan.

12:18.933 --> 12:21.333
Just tell me something.

12:21.333 --> 12:22.633
Do you ever wonder if--

12:22.633 --> 12:26.367
Abe, it's sex o'clock.

12:26.367 --> 12:28.667
It may have sounded
like I said the number six,

12:28.667 --> 12:32.900
but instead I substituted it
with a more suggestive word.

12:32.900 --> 12:34.767
[whispering]
"Sex."

12:34.767 --> 12:37.200
[smooth, sultry music]

12:37.200 --> 12:38.733
[emotional music]

12:38.733 --> 12:39.933
[smooth, sultry music]

12:39.933 --> 12:41.367
[emotional music]

12:41.367 --> 12:45.067
[smooth, sultry music]

12:46.100 --> 12:47.667
Okay.

12:47.667 --> 12:49.400
Let's ride.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.567
[whispering]
Cotton balls.

12:51.567 --> 12:54.267
[laughs weakly]

12:54.267 --> 12:55.533
Oh, Abe.

12:55.533 --> 12:58.567
You're so funny.

12:58.567 --> 12:59.600
[crying]

13:04.433 --> 13:07.433
[soft guitar music]

13:07.433 --> 13:09.567
*

13:09.567 --> 13:12.100
Best night of my life.

13:12.100 --> 13:13.767
Best night of our...

13:13.767 --> 13:15.567
lives.

13:15.567 --> 13:17.733
Best night of my life!

13:20.700 --> 13:22.700
[both slurping]

13:22.700 --> 13:26.100
[moaning]

13:26.100 --> 13:29.433
(man)
* Boy meets girl

13:29.433 --> 13:30.767
It's time.

13:30.767 --> 13:32.333
(man)
* And everyone can tell

13:32.333 --> 13:35.067
* When every second word

13:35.067 --> 13:37.500
* Is your name

13:37.500 --> 13:41.100
* All I know

13:41.100 --> 13:43.133
Oh, Abe.

13:43.133 --> 13:44.533
Oh, Joan.

13:44.533 --> 13:46.933
Oh, Abe--
a minute.

13:46.933 --> 13:49.233
What did you just say?

13:51.433 --> 13:53.500
I don't happen to recall.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.333
You called me Joan?

13:55.333 --> 13:56.667
No, I didn't, Joan.

13:56.667 --> 13:57.833
I'm pretty sure you did.

13:57.833 --> 13:59.500
Joan, don't be crazy!

13:59.500 --> 14:04.900
I just meant that I was
jonesing for you, Joan.

14:04.900 --> 14:05.900
Say my name.

14:05.900 --> 14:07.067
- Say what now?
- Say it!

14:07.067 --> 14:08.767
Sure, no problem.

14:08.767 --> 14:12.433
Jo-Clll--

14:12.433 --> 14:14.233
Jee-Cl--

14:14.233 --> 14:16.967
Jee-Clll-Jee--

14:16.967 --> 14:21.833
(Joan's voice)
Kiss me, Abe.

14:21.833 --> 14:23.767
What the hell
are you doing?

14:23.767 --> 14:27.067
Do you seriously think I'm gonna
go through with this now?

14:27.067 --> 14:29.967
(Joan's voice in slow motion)
Kiss me, Abe.

14:31.267 --> 14:33.067
What could this mean?

14:33.067 --> 14:36.467
You're in love
with Joan, Abe.

14:36.467 --> 14:39.100
[crying]
You're in love with Joan.

14:39.100 --> 14:41.067
Maybe my mouth is broken?

14:41.067 --> 14:42.833
(Joan's voice)
You're in love with Joan.

14:42.833 --> 14:46.167
[gasps]

14:49.300 --> 14:51.633
Shouldn't you be
with your other dates?

14:51.633 --> 14:53.200
Actually, uh,

14:53.200 --> 14:54.867
Catherine the Great
is heaving bile

14:54.867 --> 14:56.800
into the hot dog vat,

14:56.800 --> 15:00.400
and I gave the Bronte sisters
to the Three Stooges.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.067
You know,
I used you, Kennedy.

15:02.067 --> 15:05.367
I used you to try
to make Abe jealous.

15:05.367 --> 15:06.367
Aah!

15:06.367 --> 15:07.633
I'm such a girl.

15:07.633 --> 15:09.200
Exactly.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.900
You're a real
knockout Betty, Joan,

15:11.900 --> 15:13.867
and a better Betty
when you're not faking

15:13.867 --> 15:15.333
being a slutty whore.

15:15.333 --> 15:19.900
You mean you like me
when I'm just me?

15:19.900 --> 15:21.333
Ring-a-ding-ding.

15:21.333 --> 15:23.567
That chowderhead Lincoln
just can't see it

15:23.567 --> 15:25.800
without some bozo makeover.

15:25.800 --> 15:29.100
I tell ya, that guy's head
is so full of chowder,

15:29.100 --> 15:31.267
he should have
a bread bowl for a beard.

15:31.267 --> 15:33.167
[laughs]

15:34.800 --> 15:37.067
Heh.

15:37.067 --> 15:38.267
Okay, okay, all right,

15:38.267 --> 15:39.800
one more
but just one.

15:39.800 --> 15:41.067
[crowd groans]

15:41.067 --> 15:43.400
This one time, uh--
Oh, this is good.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.200
This one time, Saget and I
were down in Mexico

15:45.200 --> 15:47.067
doing some promotion
for Full H,

15:47.067 --> 15:49.667
and Saget decides he wants
to learn to parasail.

15:49.667 --> 15:51.100
Anyway, the problem was,
the Beach Boys

15:51.100 --> 15:53.200
needed me to hit sticks
for a benefit show in Oaxaca--

15:53.200 --> 15:54.400
Stamos!

15:54.400 --> 15:56.433
Cinnamon,
good to see you too, bro.

15:56.433 --> 15:57.900
That crown is mine.

15:57.900 --> 15:59.567
Abe, Abe, relax.

15:59.567 --> 16:00.867
Take the crown.

16:00.867 --> 16:02.600
I got plenty more
of those ponies at home.

16:02.600 --> 16:03.600
(crowd)
Aw.

16:03.600 --> 16:06.167
No, no, it's all right.

16:06.167 --> 16:08.433
I want you to have it!

16:08.433 --> 16:11.567
O-o-o-o-ow!
My eye!

16:11.567 --> 16:15.367
Ow, ow!

16:15.367 --> 16:16.433
[laughs]

16:16.433 --> 16:18.867
Ow.

16:18.867 --> 16:20.567
[laughs]

16:20.567 --> 16:22.500
[laughing maniacally]

16:22.500 --> 16:23.867
Oh, my God.

16:23.867 --> 16:25.367
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

16:25.367 --> 16:27.267
You chose me.

16:27.267 --> 16:31.067
I'm--I'm Scudworth,
king of the prom!

16:31.067 --> 16:33.433
Yee!

16:34.500 --> 16:35.567
Gandhi, Gandhi,

16:35.567 --> 16:37.067
I was about
to have S-E-X with Cleo,

16:37.067 --> 16:39.233
but then her junk looked
like floating Joan heads.

16:39.233 --> 16:40.800
Did the Joan heads
say anything

16:40.800 --> 16:42.767
about wanting to dry hump
ten dudes

16:42.767 --> 16:44.933
and one other dude
one extra time

16:44.933 --> 16:46.533
'cause he's the leader
of the pack?

16:46.533 --> 16:48.533
I think I might be
in love with Joan.

16:48.533 --> 16:50.867
Do you think there's a chance
she returns my feelings?

16:53.133 --> 16:54.433
Abe, I want you.

16:54.433 --> 16:55.533
You want me to what?

16:55.533 --> 16:56.933
Makes me so mad,
I could kiss you.

16:56.933 --> 16:58.300
What was that last part?

16:58.300 --> 17:00.067
- I love yo--
- Shh.

17:00.067 --> 17:01.067
I want you.

17:01.067 --> 17:02.633
I just want you!

17:02.633 --> 17:03.933
Abe?
Abe?

17:03.933 --> 17:04.967
Abe.
Abe.

17:04.967 --> 17:05.967
Abe.
Abe.

17:05.967 --> 17:06.967
Abe.
Abe.

17:06.967 --> 17:08.167
Abe.
Abe.

17:08.167 --> 17:09.200
Abe.
Abe.

17:09.200 --> 17:10.200
Abe.
Abe.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.533
* Ay-ay-Abe

17:11.533 --> 17:13.967
Abe!

17:15.500 --> 17:16.900
What?

17:16.900 --> 17:17.900
slap!

17:17.900 --> 17:18.900
I see.

17:18.900 --> 17:20.067
Wait.

17:20.067 --> 17:21.267
Cleo's in there now,

17:21.267 --> 17:22.300
lonely,

17:22.300 --> 17:23.700
sexually unsatisfied,

17:23.700 --> 17:24.967
and totally naked,

17:24.967 --> 17:27.133
except with Joan heads
covering her junk?

17:27.133 --> 17:28.633
That is the case.

17:32.400 --> 17:35.233
Go away, Gandhi.

17:36.900 --> 17:38.100
Hi, Gandhi.

17:38.100 --> 17:40.433
Ooh, ooh.

17:40.433 --> 17:42.067
[loud crash]

17:45.067 --> 17:49.367
[both laughing]

17:49.367 --> 17:51.433
Oh, Marie,

17:51.433 --> 17:54.667
I'm so sorry...
for everything.

17:54.667 --> 17:55.833
I wasn't thinking.

17:55.833 --> 17:57.133
Oh, Gandhi,

17:57.133 --> 18:00.667
you'll always have
a place in my heart.

18:03.067 --> 18:05.533
Anyway, I hope
this doesn't rub you

18:05.533 --> 18:07.500
the wrong way,

18:07.500 --> 18:12.133
but I'd like to rub you
the right way.

18:12.133 --> 18:13.667
[sighs]

18:13.667 --> 18:15.700
You know what, Marie?

18:15.700 --> 18:17.600
We're so young.

18:17.600 --> 18:19.100
Let's wait.

18:19.100 --> 18:25.100
I guess the driest love of all
is abstinence.

18:25.100 --> 18:26.567
[both gasp]

18:26.567 --> 18:28.733
(shadowy figure)
Assembled students
of Clone High,

18:28.733 --> 18:33.333
your collective asses
now belong to us.

18:33.333 --> 18:36.067
Oh, about that, uh...

18:36.067 --> 18:38.267
I'm gonna take
my vacation time now.

18:38.267 --> 18:39.533
[shrieks]

18:39.533 --> 18:44.167
[hard rock music]

18:44.167 --> 18:46.533
But it's too early.

18:46.533 --> 18:48.100
The clones,
they're not ready.

18:48.100 --> 18:49.233
Wait.

18:51.600 --> 18:53.833
The prom king was just about
to start a--

18:53.833 --> 18:56.200
start a conga line.

18:56.200 --> 18:57.300
[gasps]

18:57.300 --> 18:59.067
Yes, you can't
break up the prom

18:59.067 --> 19:02.367
before the traditional
prom king-led conga line.

19:04.067 --> 19:05.167
