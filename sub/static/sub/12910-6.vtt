'Reverent till the Heavenly Gates,
with incense, candles and wax,

00:29.841 --> 00:31.641
truer, lighter,

00:31.761 --> 00:34.201
take my gold chains
or beat me with 'em,

00:34.321 --> 00:37.481
but you can't undo it,
brother, tell 'em...'

00:45.601 --> 00:47.201
What's wrong?

00:48.281 --> 00:50.281
Those words, hear 'em?

00:51.201 --> 00:53.201
Think I need them?

00:55.401 --> 00:57.601
You're worried about Conte?

00:57.801 --> 01:01.801
You think Salvatore Conte
will be glad to see me?

01:02.441 --> 01:04.441
He's waiting with open arms!

01:07.601 --> 01:10.801
I bet he's forgotten
I set fire to his mother's house.

01:13.001 --> 01:15.001
Sure, I'm worried.

01:17.161 --> 01:19.561
Also because
I'm leaving you here alone.

01:21.001 --> 01:23.001
Don't worry about me,

01:23.201 --> 01:25.201
just think about making a deal
with Conte,

01:25.401 --> 01:28.281
when you're back, we'll take 'em all.

01:32.001 --> 01:33.601
Can I turn it on?

01:33.801 --> 01:36.401
Hurry up or I'll miss my flight.

02:26.881 --> 02:29.081
This way, please.

02:34.401 --> 02:36.001
Wait.

02:37.401 --> 02:39.401
I need the bathroom.

04:10.801 --> 04:12.801
Can I meet Don Salvatore right away?

04:14.001 --> 04:16.201
I'm taking you to the hotel.

04:17.440 --> 04:20.321
- Hotel?
- That's what they told me.

04:32.441 --> 04:36.241
'On Sunday, legislative elections
will be held in Catalonia.

04:36.441 --> 04:38.441
Front-runner
is Javier Lozano lglesias,

04:38.641 --> 04:40.841
who hopes to bolster
his plan for independence.

04:41.041 --> 04:44.241
But Eulalia Cases y Santos
is sure of winning.

04:44.441 --> 04:48.041
5,4 million Catalans are asked
to make a choice.

04:48.241 --> 04:51.641
Polls will be open
from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.'

05:11.481 --> 05:13.081
Nice!

05:13.801 --> 05:15.601
It's all his.

05:17.241 --> 05:20.521
- What do we do now?
- Rest, I'll call you later.

05:52.201 --> 05:54.801
My room no good.

05:55.801 --> 05:58.001
No good, change.

05:59.601 --> 06:02.001
Another room, yes.

06:04.401 --> 06:05.801
Thank you.

06:09.201 --> 06:10.801
Fuck them!

06:29.801 --> 06:31.281
He got here?

06:32.201 --> 06:33.601
Yeah.

06:34.201 --> 06:36.001
I'll tell Don Salvatore.

06:40.601 --> 06:43.401
Okay, change his room.

07:23.601 --> 07:25.201
Who is it?

07:25.401 --> 07:27.001
It's me.

07:29.601 --> 07:31.601
Hide this.

07:38.801 --> 07:41.201
Your phone's off,
I have to talk to you.

07:46.601 --> 07:48.601
Get moving, it's urgent.

07:48.801 --> 07:51.001
- Move!
- I'm comin'.

07:52.681 --> 07:55.281
We got word from our contact.

07:56.201 --> 08:00.801
The money's in and I've decided
you're the only one who can do this.

08:02.001 --> 08:05.801
So, if Ciro makes up with Conte,
we're all set.

08:07.001 --> 08:10.481
- Where's Honduras anyway?
- Near Mexico, Guatemala.

08:11.401 --> 08:13.001
But why me?

08:13.201 --> 08:16.201
This is the beginning,
our name has to be on it.

08:17.401 --> 08:20.801
Gennaro, this thing
is bigger than anything else.

08:21.641 --> 08:26.241
If we pull it off, they'll all
come to us, we'll be the strongest.

08:28.601 --> 08:30.001
And for you too.

08:30.201 --> 08:33.001
They'll finally see who's in charge,

08:33.400 --> 08:36.001
it would be clear you're the boss.

08:40.001 --> 08:41.801
Okay, Mom, I can do it.

08:45.601 --> 08:48.401
My name's Savastano, I can do it,

08:48.601 --> 08:51.081
we'll be bigger than everybody.

08:51.881 --> 08:53.881
Where are you going? Come here!

08:55.201 --> 08:57.601
No one can know.

08:59.201 --> 09:01.801
- And Noemi?
- Say you gotta leave.

09:02.001 --> 09:04.201
But don't say where.

09:04.801 --> 09:09.001
This will work only
if nobody knows anything, hear me?

09:10.201 --> 09:12.401
- Okay.
- Not even Ciro.

09:17.401 --> 09:18.881
Not even Ciro.

10:11.201 --> 10:13.401
- Hello?
- Nothing's on today.

10:14.001 --> 10:16.401
What the fuck's that mean?

10:17.841 --> 10:21.041
- What the fuck do I do?
- I don't know, whatever you like.

10:21.241 --> 10:22.841
See you tomorrow.

10:38.401 --> 10:40.201
Wait, honey!

10:41.401 --> 10:43.201
Honey, wait!

10:43.601 --> 10:45.401
What for?

10:45.801 --> 10:48.801
For me to come back,
then we'll be in charge.

10:49.601 --> 10:52.801
You always promise
but never come through.

10:53.001 --> 10:57.281
You said I'd be a queen and look!
Think that's a palace?

10:57.481 --> 11:00.481
Now I even have to wait... Why?

11:01.201 --> 11:03.201
- Because when I get back...
- "When I get back..."

11:15.401 --> 11:17.201
- You'll be back?
- Yeah.

11:18.201 --> 11:20.001
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:21.601 --> 11:23.601
Then leave me a token.

11:24.601 --> 11:26.201
A token?

11:26.401 --> 11:28.201
A token of love.

11:47.401 --> 11:50.401
I'm better off, I was fed up anyway.

11:50.961 --> 11:54.641
You're a nobody,
they walk all over you.

11:54.841 --> 11:57.921
You're a nobody, just a loser!

13:08.481 --> 13:10.081
The bastards...

13:10.401 --> 13:12.001
Pieces of shit!

13:12.601 --> 13:14.401
Those bastards!

13:19.201 --> 13:21.201
Bastards, bastards...

13:22.601 --> 13:24.201
Bastards!

14:05.441 --> 14:06.441
Who is it?

14:27.161 --> 14:29.841
- What are you saying?
- A person for you.

14:30.801 --> 14:32.601
In the lobby.

14:32.801 --> 14:34.401
I understand.

14:38.681 --> 14:40.361
- Good morning.
- Now's okay?

14:40.561 --> 14:41.961
The car's out front.

14:42.161 --> 14:44.361
I want to thank him
for the great evening.

14:49.721 --> 14:50.721
See that?

14:52.721 --> 14:54.321
Some of it's his.

15:05.201 --> 15:07.801
That's his too, 25 floors.

15:16.401 --> 15:19.881
This is the most important thing,
the casino.

15:22.601 --> 15:24.001
Pull over.

15:24.201 --> 15:25.401
- Why?
- I gotta pee.

15:25.601 --> 15:27.001
Here?

15:27.761 --> 15:30.761
If you don't, I'll pee in the car.

15:38.001 --> 15:42.201
Sightseeing's over,
take me to see Conte, okay?

15:43.601 --> 15:45.001
I have different orders.

15:45.201 --> 15:48.201
I don't give a fuck,
I'm sick of waiting, call him.

15:48.401 --> 15:50.001
Take the phone!

15:50.201 --> 15:52.601
I'll kill you with my own hands,
make it fast!

15:52.801 --> 15:54.401
Call him!

15:56.201 --> 15:57.801
It's me.

15:58.601 --> 16:00.401
We have a problem with the guest.

16:01.801 --> 16:03.601
We're coming.

16:05.201 --> 16:06.601
Good!

16:43.201 --> 16:44.601
You got faith?

16:48.321 --> 16:50.121
It's important,

16:51.161 --> 16:54.561
if you got faith,
you're never alone, never afraid.

17:07.961 --> 17:10.961
Without faith
I'd never have got anywhere.

17:22.401 --> 17:25.401
And I have just one person
to thank for this,

17:26.761 --> 17:29.361
who made me see what faith <i>is...</i>

17:33.401 --> 17:35.081
my mother.

17:51.401 --> 17:53.401
Do you know her?

17:55.681 --> 17:59.281
Sure you do,
even know where she lives.

19:10.001 --> 19:12.001
Like it?

19:16.441 --> 19:20.041
It's nice like this,
can't see or hear anything.

19:22.521 --> 19:25.321
Pardon me, I've been running
around in circles all morning.

19:26.681 --> 19:29.961
- When can we talk?
- You're in a rush?

19:30.161 --> 19:34.161
I just want to make things right,
and then go back home.

19:41.401 --> 19:43.001
You piece of shit,

19:44.001 --> 19:46.201
You even got a gun!

19:46.401 --> 19:48.201
Even a gun!

19:49.081 --> 19:52.681
I know it was you,
I know it was you.

19:53.561 --> 19:55.761
Who set fire to my mom's house?

19:55.961 --> 19:59.561
- It was an order!
- By another piece of shit like you.

20:00.361 --> 20:01.961
And now you gotta die.

20:06.601 --> 20:08.601
Where the fuck are you going?

20:09.201 --> 20:11.001
You bastards, where are you goin'?

20:41.601 --> 20:44.201
We'll buy it all, Gennaro.

20:44.761 --> 20:48.441
100, 200, 300 kilos...
we'll take all they got.

20:49.201 --> 20:52.281
But you set the price,
you gotta be shrewd.

20:52.481 --> 20:55.561
Start at 1.20
but don't go higher than 1.40.

20:57.241 --> 20:59.241
I understand, max is 1.40.

20:59.481 --> 21:00.961
Good,

21:01.161 --> 21:04.961
so we sell it to dealers at 30,

21:05.161 --> 21:08.961
they sell at 50
and we push 'em all out,

21:09.161 --> 21:10.841
no more room for anybody.

21:11.601 --> 21:15.401
When you wrap it up, tell me
and I'll take care of the rest.

21:17.401 --> 21:20.401
- And then?
- Then you stay there.

21:21.401 --> 21:25.401
When the shipment leaves there,
the money leaves here.

21:25.601 --> 21:28.801
When the money gets there,
you come back to Naples.

21:31.241 --> 21:35.841
- Why do I have to wait?
- Because you're their guarantee.

21:36.081 --> 21:39.761
If you're there,
that means the money's coming.

21:42.321 --> 21:43.921
<i>Okay-</i>

21:44.121 --> 21:46.121
This is your contact.

21:47.401 --> 21:51.401
But learn the number by heart,
because this paper's gotta disappear.

21:52.401 --> 21:56.001
Have a good trip
and may the Holy Virgin be with you.

21:56.201 --> 21:58.201
- Bye, Little Baron.
- Bye, Gennaro.

22:01.401 --> 22:03.201
- Lady Imma...
- Goodbye.

22:03.401 --> 22:04.801
Goodbye.

22:13.441 --> 22:14.841
What is it?

22:18.201 --> 22:20.201
Just like your father.

22:24.841 --> 22:27.721
- I gotta learn this number.
- Good.

23:35.801 --> 23:37.201
'EspaÃ±a Mobil,

23:37.401 --> 23:39.601
the number you dialed
is not available,

23:39.801 --> 23:41.601
try again later...'

24:07.401 --> 24:09.401
Someone wants to talk to you.

24:14.401 --> 24:17.801
- Hello?
-'We can talk tonight.

24:18.601 --> 24:21.201
I'll send for you at 10, okay?'

24:23.201 --> 24:25.201
- Okay.
- 'Good man.'

24:59.961 --> 25:01.641
Now we're almost even.

25:03.361 --> 25:05.961
- Almost?
- Yeah.

25:06.361 --> 25:08.641
To be even,
I should make your mother cry too.

25:10.201 --> 25:11.401
I don't have one.

25:19.001 --> 25:20.281
Sit down.

25:30.361 --> 25:32.441
I'd rather stay home at night,

25:33.161 --> 25:35.361
but my money's in it, so I gotta see.

25:35.561 --> 25:36.841
Like it?

25:39.401 --> 25:42.001
I like it,
but there aren't many people.

25:42.201 --> 25:44.281
Because it's early,

25:44.481 --> 25:47.761
in Spain
people still haven't eaten.

25:51.641 --> 25:55.121
Don Salvatore,
we'd like to settle things.

25:55.321 --> 25:56.921
Yeah, sure,

25:57.601 --> 26:01.721
now that the hashish market's all
mine, they want to settle things.

26:07.201 --> 26:10.201
Pietro Savastano
always treated me like trash,

26:10.401 --> 26:12.601
but you'll all be under me.

26:14.601 --> 26:17.681
Things are changing,
there's some fresh air.

26:18.961 --> 26:20.961
And who's this fresh air, you?

26:23.801 --> 26:25.201
Also.

26:25.881 --> 26:28.481
- But especially his son.
- Fatboy?

26:29.201 --> 26:32.401
Nah, his head just
keeps his ears apart.

26:33.601 --> 26:35.601
But he's a good kid

26:37.001 --> 26:38.881
and pays attention to good advice.

26:47.561 --> 26:48.561
<i>MOW.!</i>

26:50.681 --> 26:53.961
I've been trying to call Ciro
since this morning, but no answer,

26:55.201 --> 26:57.001
his phone's off.

26:57.881 --> 26:59.681
What do you want from Ciro?

27:03.601 --> 27:05.401
I wanted to say hello.

27:11.801 --> 27:14.001
- Are you scared?
- No.

27:16.801 --> 27:18.601
Not for me!

27:20.001 --> 27:21.601
For you.

27:24.201 --> 27:27.801
I'm leaving.
Who knows where Ciro is.

27:28.001 --> 27:30.201
There's not just Ciro, you know,

27:30.761 --> 27:33.161
there are lots of people here.

27:33.361 --> 27:36.041
C'mon, go to bed, it's late,

27:36.241 --> 27:38.321
you leave in four hours.

27:41.401 --> 27:42.801
<i>MOW.!</i>

27:46.361 --> 27:48.161
<i>That girl, Noemi...</i>

27:50.001 --> 27:51.601
I left her.

27:53.441 --> 27:55.441
You were right,
she was no good for me.

27:56.481 --> 27:58.681
Good, you did well.

28:00.001 --> 28:01.401
<i>MOW.!</i>

28:03.601 --> 28:05.201
What is it?

28:09.801 --> 28:13.401
- Will you miss me a little?
- Good heavens, Gennaro...

28:14.401 --> 28:16.601
Of course I will.

28:20.401 --> 28:22.601
Can I have a kiss?

28:23.801 --> 28:25.601
You're too big for kisses!

28:33.201 --> 28:35.201
Mom, I already miss you.

28:36.201 --> 28:37.801
Understand?

28:40.001 --> 28:42.081
If anything happens,
I'll come right back,

28:43.201 --> 28:45.001
understand?

28:49.561 --> 28:53.041
Some have gas,
and others have gas stations.

28:54.001 --> 28:57.801
You have gas,
but we've got gas stations.

28:59.801 --> 29:02.401
We should be friends.

29:02.921 --> 29:06.801
Think I'm hurtin'
without your gas stations?

29:07.001 --> 29:09.681
- Somethin' I haven't got?
- Nothing.

29:11.081 --> 29:13.481
But back home,

29:13.721 --> 29:16.401
no one's better than us,

29:16.601 --> 29:18.201
you know that.

29:21.401 --> 29:23.801
Just think about it.

29:27.001 --> 29:28.801
Will you?

29:30.201 --> 29:32.001
I'll think about it,

29:32.801 --> 29:35.001
I'll go pee and think about it.

30:15.601 --> 30:18.001
Eremenko very angry with you.

30:18.921 --> 30:21.001
Your game dangerous.

30:24.881 --> 30:27.361
What? Can't you see I'm busy?

30:27.561 --> 30:31.161
A piece of shit just followed
Don Salvatore into the toilet.

30:33.841 --> 30:36.641
Never come to my house again
and be an asshole.

30:36.881 --> 30:38.881
Don Salvatore, trouble?

30:39.081 --> 30:42.881
This shithead's threatenin' me
in my own house. Where were you?

30:53.001 --> 30:57.401
Come and see, we got sewer rats
here too, Russians.

30:58.801 --> 31:02.201
Tell me, what exactly
should I be careful of?

31:02.401 --> 31:04.201
Eremenko...

31:04.401 --> 31:07.601
Very. Very big and you...

31:09.881 --> 31:10.961
little.

31:12.641 --> 31:16.241
Now I'll show you the difference
between me and you,

31:16.441 --> 31:18.721
so you can tell your master.

31:23.961 --> 31:25.561
Stay still!

31:37.201 --> 31:38.801
Get lost!

31:39.841 --> 31:41.441
Go tell your boss.

31:58.841 --> 32:01.041
These fuckin' Russians...

32:01.801 --> 32:04.201
they're loaded and they're vicious.

32:08.401 --> 32:11.201
And they think
that's enough to give orders.

32:13.201 --> 32:15.201
They think wrong.

32:15.761 --> 32:19.241
It takes this,
they've got a long way to go.

32:27.801 --> 32:29.801
Don Salvatore, pardon <i>me...</i>

32:30.601 --> 32:34.401
My proposal, you still haven't said
what you think.

32:37.001 --> 32:39.681
I still can't see
who's givin' orders in your house.

32:40.241 --> 32:43.321
I can tell you that my word counts.

32:45.321 --> 32:47.521
If we make this agreement now,

32:48.641 --> 32:52.521
you'll have just one problem:
counting our money.

33:09.841 --> 33:11.441
Don Salvatore!

33:12.241 --> 33:13.441
My neck...

33:20.801 --> 33:23.401
- Let's go.
- Hey, you're hurtin' me!

33:35.801 --> 33:38.001
'Worshipped, if a cop kills me,

33:38.201 --> 33:40.401
I get a kick at being hated,

33:40.601 --> 33:43.081
the perversion
of a good kid with a gun.

33:43.281 --> 33:46.481
Each tattoo is blood in a frame

33:46.641 --> 33:49.241
and we'll dance in your face
at the club...'

34:09.201 --> 34:11.001
Genny, be careful!

34:13.360 --> 34:14.761
Be good.

34:25.201 --> 34:27.601
Yes, for Rome is perfect.

34:29.201 --> 34:31.001
But on the first flight.

34:32.041 --> 34:33.041
Thank you.

34:34.801 --> 34:36.801
Fuck 'em all!

34:40.521 --> 34:43.521
We set you up good
and you want to leave?

34:48.041 --> 34:50.041
Wait a minute,

34:50.241 --> 34:53.041
being impulsive is never good.

34:54.601 --> 34:56.201
C'mon down.

35:07.881 --> 35:12.761
They wanted to buy on the north coast
to develop real estate

35:13.001 --> 35:15.201
and to import their drug shipments.

35:15.401 --> 35:18.001
I figured: why leave it to them?

35:18.201 --> 35:20.801
I'll buy it. Fuck the Russians.

35:21.801 --> 35:23.801
But it was a mistake,

35:24.001 --> 35:26.081
we ended up locking horns

35:26.281 --> 35:28.881
and now I'm here
with a crushed vertebra,

35:29.081 --> 35:31.481
wearin' this neck thing like a dog.

35:33.601 --> 35:35.801
I can't wipe them out,

35:36.801 --> 35:38.601
I gotta negotiate.

35:43.601 --> 35:47.201
So I thought:
want to make peace with me?

35:49.241 --> 35:51.641
Do you want my hash?

35:55.601 --> 35:58.601
Then you do the negotiating
with the Russians.

35:59.201 --> 36:04.201
When this thing's over, you and me
will start doing business again.

36:06.041 --> 36:07.841
But it's your deal.

36:08.041 --> 36:10.241
Let's not waste time,

36:10.441 --> 36:12.521
'no' is not an option.

36:14.001 --> 36:17.201
If you want to go home,
see that asshole Eremenko

36:17.841 --> 36:22.641
and tell him we'll split it:
60 for me, 40 for them.

36:22.841 --> 36:25.321
What's this got to do with me?

36:25.521 --> 36:29.201
You're part, because the Russians
are really pissed off

36:30.001 --> 36:33.601
and I can't afford
to lose one of my own men.

36:46.841 --> 36:48.641
Now I see.

36:53.881 --> 36:56.681
- 60 for you, 40 for them.
- Right.

36:57.601 --> 37:00.401
I'd stand a better chance
in middle of the sea.

37:03.921 --> 37:05.521
You underestimate yourself.

37:08.401 --> 37:10.001
Relax,

37:10.801 --> 37:13.401
the kid will come for you later.

37:13.601 --> 37:15.201
Take care, Ciro.

38:09.681 --> 38:11.481
Got paper and pen?

38:12.441 --> 38:14.121
Give it here, c'mon.

38:14.321 --> 38:16.121
Make it fast!

38:16.321 --> 38:17.721
Give it here.

40:33.401 --> 40:34.801
Good evening.

40:38.801 --> 40:40.201
This way.

41:07.241 --> 41:08.521
Vitaly Eremenko.

41:18.201 --> 41:19.601
Talk.

41:28.001 --> 41:30.001
Mr. Conte would like

41:31.121 --> 41:32.601
to settle this thing.

41:36.721 --> 41:38.321
So, he'll leave it?

41:42.801 --> 41:44.201
No.

41:49.881 --> 41:52.081
Then he doesn't want to settle.

41:52.881 --> 41:55.281
We wants to make a deal with you.

42:03.641 --> 42:06.041
Eremenko doesn't share his things.

42:08.401 --> 42:10.801
It depends what he wants to do
with his things.

42:11.841 --> 42:15.241
We've been here for 20 years,
easier if you work with us.

42:18.201 --> 42:20.201
We all win.

42:21.001 --> 42:23.201
It's better to be friends
than fight a war.

42:36.561 --> 42:37.561
What's this?

42:37.761 --> 42:41.361
They're the next
city election winners,

42:41.561 --> 42:43.641
they'll decide who builds what.

42:48.961 --> 42:51.161
Together with the inspectors
on the building commissions,

42:51.361 --> 42:53.761
the public works
licensing officials...

42:53.961 --> 42:57.161
We know them all, we pay them.

43:04.961 --> 43:09.041
With them,
any project's already a go.

43:09.241 --> 43:12.841
Without them,
you can buy all the land you want...

43:13.441 --> 43:15.241
You'll build 10 years later.

43:22.641 --> 43:24.241
50-50.

43:26.601 --> 43:28.201
Our friends here

43:28.881 --> 43:31.081
become yours too.

43:40.081 --> 43:42.081
You like games, huh?

43:48.001 --> 43:50.001
These are just candidates.

43:51.521 --> 43:53.521
No one knows who'll win.

44:00.401 --> 44:03.601
But, it's true, you have
more friends here than us

44:04.401 --> 44:06.401
and friends are important.

44:06.601 --> 44:08.001
Friends.

44:09.001 --> 44:10.601
Friends.

44:17.401 --> 44:20.201
We split... 50-50.

44:38.521 --> 44:41.121
Eremenko likes games too.

44:46.801 --> 44:49.081
Do you know Russian roulette?

44:51.481 --> 44:53.881
But it's an Eremenko variant.

45:06.281 --> 45:10.281
I'm part of the System, if I don't
come back, there's no agreement.

45:31.801 --> 45:35.401
The one who sent you here
knew you might not come back.

45:36.881 --> 45:40.361
You're not very important
for them, Ciro.

45:43.801 --> 45:47.401
Half a chance is better
than no chance.

45:48.881 --> 45:51.361
- 50-50.
- Go!

46:09.401 --> 46:12.201
Watch the light, when it comes <i>on...</i>

46:13.001 --> 46:14.601
shoot

46:44.281 --> 46:45.681
Friends.

47:39.281 --> 47:42.281
- I said 60 for me, 40 for them.
- Salvatore...

47:47.281 --> 47:49.681
But 50-50 is better than nothing.

47:53.561 --> 47:56.361
Now you have to keep your word,

47:56.561 --> 48:00.561
bury the hatchet
and the Moroccan comes to us.

48:04.001 --> 48:06.401
I have a better proposition...

48:08.561 --> 48:10.641
Come work for me
and I'll change your life.

48:13.201 --> 48:15.001
I'm honoured,

48:17.001 --> 48:19.401
but I already have a house.

48:20.281 --> 48:23.081
- And I give the orders in my house.
- Yeah?

48:25.201 --> 48:28.601
Then why did they send you here
to risk dying?

48:31.681 --> 48:33.681
Anyway.

48:34.761 --> 48:36.961
I feel good in my house.

48:42.601 --> 48:45.001
I hope you always feel that way.

49:08.841 --> 49:12.041
- Hello, Counsellor.
- Hello, Lady Imma.

49:12.241 --> 49:15.921
Why this sudden meeting,
has something happened to Pietro?

49:16.121 --> 49:19.401
Your husband is really angry,

49:19.601 --> 49:23.081
Ciro in Spain and Genny
in South America isn't what he said.

49:24.361 --> 49:27.161
Wait a moment, Counsellor,

49:27.361 --> 49:29.161
I forgot something.

49:29.361 --> 49:30.961
Take your time.

49:38.721 --> 49:41.601
What the fuck do you mean,
Gennaro's not here?

49:41.801 --> 49:43.201
He left.

49:43.401 --> 49:45.401
He left? For where?

49:45.601 --> 49:48.801
I don't know, only Lady Imma
and Little Baron do.

49:51.201 --> 49:52.801
Get moving!

49:53.001 --> 49:56.001
- Where to?
- Savastano's house.

50:50.001 --> 50:53.401
- 'Are you okay?'
- 'Let's cut the shit.

50:55.801 --> 50:58.481
Just tell me
what the fuck's going on.'

51:58.521 --> 52:00.201
'What do you mean?'

52:03.001 --> 52:05.401
'I've always been at your side,

52:07.001 --> 52:09.001
now you're gone.

52:11.841 --> 52:14.041
And I'm still here.'
