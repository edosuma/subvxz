00:02.398 --> 00:05.732
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

00:05.836 --> 00:09.033
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:09.139 --> 00:12.667
<i>But where are those
good old-fashioned values</i>

00:12.777 --> 00:15.712
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:15.814 --> 00:19.080
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:19.185 --> 00:22.382
<i>Lucky there's a man who
positively can do</i>

00:22.488 --> 00:23.978
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:24.090 --> 00:25.718
<i>Laugh and cry</i>

00:25.826 --> 00:30.820
<i>He's a family guy</i>

00:35.436 --> 00:36.960
<i>We now return to</i>

00:37.071 --> 00:39.370
Homosexual Gynecologist.

00:39.475 --> 00:41.670
<i>Okay, Mrs. Robinson, let's take a look.</i>

00:41.777 --> 00:42.766
<i>Ew!</i>

00:42.878 --> 00:43.867
<i>It looks like a sad, old man.</i>

00:45.744 --> 00:48.508
Hey, check it out, you guys.
I got a new cell phone that takes pictures.

00:48.614 --> 00:51.412
Look, look, I took a picture of Lois' poo.

00:52.986 --> 00:55.614
She should've handed out cigars
after that one.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.519
That's hilarious.
You should e-mail that to me.

00:57.624 --> 00:59.525
Hey, did you guys see the game last night?

00:59.627 --> 01:02.653
- Oh, yeah.
- That offensive line is outstanding.

01:02.763 --> 01:04.492
Yeah, you should e-mail me that picture.

01:04.599 --> 01:05.965
- Hey, boys.
- What the hell are you guys doing here?

01:07.970 --> 01:10.200
We just decided
to have a little girls' night out.

01:10.306 --> 01:14.607
Yeah. You guys talk about this place
all the time. We figured we'd give it a try.

01:14.711 --> 01:17.202
Bernice, we haven't really been dating
long enough

01:17.314 --> 01:19.840
for you to be hanging out
with my friends' wives.

01:19.984 --> 01:21.713
- Shut up, Cleveland!
- Okay.

01:22.921 --> 01:27.086
Check it out, girls. Jukebox, huh?
Hey, you guys want to dance?

01:27.192 --> 01:29.387
- Yeah, totally.
- Hell, yeah.

01:35.268 --> 01:37.031
Oh, my God, this sucks.

01:37.137 --> 01:39.868
The Clam's the only place we got
to get away from the women.

01:39.974 --> 01:42.966
This is a bigger disaster
than Jack Black's last movie.

01:43.210 --> 01:47.272
<i>We now return
to Jack Black in The Unconventional Butler.</i>

01:47.883 --> 01:49.783
<i>Edgar, could you bring me some tea?</i>

01:49.885 --> 01:53.845
<i>Yeah! Yeah!</i>

01:53.957 --> 01:57.449
<i>Wait a minute. Butlers are supposed to be
fancy and well-mannered.</i>

01:57.560 --> 01:59.961
<i>This guy's screaming
and waving his arms around.</i>

02:00.064 --> 02:03.431
<i>You're an old man.
You don't understand the young people.</i>

02:03.534 --> 02:05.503
<i>You're right. I'll change from now on.</i>

02:08.539 --> 02:11.008
Oh, my God, that was so much fun.

02:11.109 --> 02:14.637
You know, boys,
we just might make this our regular spot.

02:17.665 --> 02:19.531
Peter? Peter?

02:19.635 --> 02:22.900
<i>Yeah, I'm sorry, Joe. I just had
one of my Scrubs fantasy moments.</i>

02:23.005 --> 02:24.598
It's the best show you're not watching.

02:24.708 --> 02:28.769
I hate shows that cut away from the story
for some bullshit.

02:32.855 --> 02:36.586
Fellas, our way of life is being threatened,
and we got to do something about it.

02:36.693 --> 02:39.288
- Couldn't we just ask the women to leave?
- No, no.

02:39.396 --> 02:42.991
I got something way more expensive
and time-consuming in mind.

02:43.367 --> 02:46.997
Well, men,
the Quahog Men's Club is complete.

02:47.105 --> 02:51.167
It took six weeks and cost $8,000,
but it was worth it.

02:51.277 --> 02:54.678
Peter, I wish you'd get rid of this thing.
It's an absolute eyesore.

02:54.780 --> 02:55.747
What do you care, Lois?

02:55.848 --> 02:58.682
You girls got The Clam.
We got the Quahog Men's Club.

02:58.785 --> 03:01.549
- Besides, we're not hurting anybody.
- What are you talking about?

03:01.655 --> 03:04.454
You ripped a whole chunk of wall
out of the house.

03:04.559 --> 03:08.120
What is this?
There's something wrong with the house.

03:08.229 --> 03:09.958
I don't like change!

03:10.298 --> 03:13.598
Peter, you can't just slap together
flimsy structures in the yard.

03:13.702 --> 03:14.828
Why not? Herbert did it.

03:15.237 --> 03:17.536
<i>Y-M-C-A</i>

03:17.641 --> 03:22.340
<i>It's fun to stay at the Y-M-C-A</i>

03:27.718 --> 03:30.585
All right, Peter, this is a tough one.
All right, are you ready for this? Okay.

03:30.688 --> 03:32.623
Would you have sex with Cleveland

03:32.724 --> 03:35.454
if it meant you could have sex
with Angelina Jolie?

03:35.560 --> 03:36.720
Uh...

03:37.497 --> 03:39.624
- Yeah. Yeah, I'd probably do it.
- Hang on, hang on.

03:39.732 --> 03:41.927
Missionary,
and you have to look him in the eye.

03:42.035 --> 03:45.563
No closing your eyes
and pretending it's somebody else.

03:45.673 --> 03:47.937
- I think, still, yes.
- Thank you, Peter.

03:48.042 --> 03:50.705
All right, here's another one.
Who would you rather have sex with?

03:50.812 --> 03:54.873
A very pregnant Gina Gershon,
or Jenny McCarthy after a car accident?

03:54.983 --> 03:58.181
Oh, hey, hang on, hang on. Look,
you know, I know this is a men's club,

03:58.287 --> 04:00.619
but why does it always have to be
about sex?

04:00.723 --> 04:02.782
Okay, look, how about this?
How about this?

04:02.892 --> 04:05.361
Who would you rather start
a small business with?

04:05.462 --> 04:09.364
<i>Janet Reno, after a safari,
or the fat guy from My Name is Earl.</i>

04:09.466 --> 04:11.662
- That still sounds like a sex question.
- It is not.

04:11.769 --> 04:13.634
Well, then what the hell does "safari"
have to do with it?

04:13.738 --> 04:16.832
<i>- What's the guy from Earl's credit rating?
- Six fifty-one.</i>

04:16.940 --> 04:18.875
- That's not bad.
- Better than mine.

04:18.976 --> 04:22.378
Does he have an idea,
or do I have to come up with it myself?

04:22.481 --> 04:24.643
He's got an idea, but it's not quite there.

04:24.751 --> 04:27.618
I'd have to give it to Janet Reno,
'cause I've always had this business plan

04:27.721 --> 04:29.814
for home delivery
of prescription medications,

04:29.923 --> 04:31.516
and that seems like it's more her market.

04:31.625 --> 04:34.492
This is stupid.
I want to talk about vaginas!

04:41.169 --> 04:44.936
Well, I'd say the Men's Club
inaugural ball is a huge success.

04:45.041 --> 04:48.340
Hey, guys, let's play a party game.
Let's go stand over near Brian,

04:48.444 --> 04:51.437
and we'll take a drink
every time he says "bonerific".

04:51.548 --> 04:53.573
- "Bonerific"?
- Yeah, it's his catch phrase.

04:53.684 --> 04:54.673
He says it all the time.

04:54.785 --> 04:55.774
- Yeah, sure. I'm in.
- Okay.

04:55.886 --> 04:56.854
Yeah, let's do it.

04:59.524 --> 05:04.656
- Hey, hey, Brian, how you feeling tonight?
- Good. Having a nice time.

05:04.764 --> 05:08.291
Are you feeling terrific,
or any variation on that word?

05:08.401 --> 05:12.031
Oh, sure. No complaints.
My skin's a little dry.

05:12.139 --> 05:14.039
He's not saying it, Peter.

05:15.876 --> 05:17.845
What?

05:17.945 --> 05:19.970
No. Why would I say that?
It's not even a word.

05:20.081 --> 05:21.776
- What isn't a word?
- "Bonerific."

05:24.286 --> 05:27.847
Didn't I tell you?
You can't keep this guy from saying it.

05:27.956 --> 05:29.719
Boy, great party, huh, Fred?

05:29.826 --> 05:33.387
Yeah. You know, Barn,
I figured I ought to tell you this.

05:33.496 --> 05:35.896
I was walking by your house the other day,

05:35.999 --> 05:39.902
and I poked my head in the window,
and Betty was undressing.

05:40.004 --> 05:42.564
Now, she saw me there,
but she didn't stop.

05:42.673 --> 05:44.301
- What?
- She didn't stop.

05:44.409 --> 05:48.470
I mean, she saw me there, looking at her,
and she kept undressing.

05:48.580 --> 05:52.642
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Are you serious?
- Yeah. I got an erection.

05:53.252 --> 05:55.083
I've got a headache.
Do you have any Anacin?

05:55.188 --> 05:57.851
- Any what? "Anacin"?
- Yeah, Anacin.

05:57.958 --> 06:00.859
- Do they even make Anacin anymore?
- Yeah, it's still around. Why?

06:00.961 --> 06:03.522
No, it just seems like
sort of a '70s medication.

06:03.631 --> 06:05.826
- So you don't have any Anacin?
- No.

06:05.934 --> 06:07.959
God, you're more worthless
than Colin Farrell.

06:08.470 --> 06:12.407
So, you got the wool cap on, huh? Yeah.

06:12.508 --> 06:15.102
Yeah, I guess. You know, whatever.
It's 96 degrees out.

06:15.211 --> 06:18.238
Better put on the old wool cap. Yeah.

06:18.348 --> 06:22.444
Got a lot going on under there,
under the wool cap?

06:23.554 --> 06:25.852
Thinking about your sideburns?

06:25.957 --> 06:28.357
Yeah. No, no, no, no.
You're not a complete jackass, yeah.

06:28.459 --> 06:31.952
Oh, hey, nice T-shirt.
"Phresh", and it's spelled with a "P-H".

06:32.064 --> 06:34.589
Oh, that's fun,
'cause it's usually spelled with an "F".

06:35.367 --> 06:37.529
Yeah. Oh, and you got a little tear
on your pants, there.

06:37.637 --> 06:39.434
Oh, that's on purpose, though, isn't it?

06:39.539 --> 06:43.271
Yeah. Yeah, you're a bad boy.
You're a bad boy.

06:43.377 --> 06:47.939
Society wants your pants to be intact,
but you're just not gonna listen, are you?

06:48.048 --> 06:51.348
My God, this is ridiculous. I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to kill you.

06:54.189 --> 06:57.557
All right, one more pre-party drink,
and then we'll head off to The Clam.

06:57.660 --> 07:00.458
It's cheaper to drink at your house first.

07:00.563 --> 07:03.294
Boy, they sure are making
a lot of noise out there.

07:03.400 --> 07:06.301
Those idiots have done nothing
but hang out in that stupid shed

07:06.403 --> 07:07.597
for the last two days.

07:07.704 --> 07:11.334
- We should crash that party.
- Hey, you know what? Bernice is right.

07:11.442 --> 07:13.501
They're always trying to get away from us.

07:13.611 --> 07:16.911
We should march in there
and remind them that they have wives.

07:17.016 --> 07:21.385
Especially if they have food,
because bar food is so overpriced.

07:21.487 --> 07:23.479
Man, who invited Anne Frank?

07:25.525 --> 07:29.360
Quagmire, tell that story about the girl
with the inside-out anus.

07:29.463 --> 07:31.897
- Oh, you mean Blossom?
- Oh, that's a great story.

07:31.999 --> 07:34.331
All right, so I'm skulking around
the intensive care unit

07:34.435 --> 07:36.199
and all of a sudden
this smoking hot chick...

07:36.305 --> 07:40.799
- Hey, boys. Mind if we join the party?
- Sorry, Lois, no girls allowed.

07:40.909 --> 07:42.070
Oh, come on, Peter.
It'd be good to have some chicks in here.

07:43.718 --> 07:46.243
Quagmire, are you nuts?
This is a men's club.

07:46.354 --> 07:51.156
There's the problem. The ratio be terrible.
It's a total mast-fest in here.

07:51.260 --> 07:52.659
- You know, I kind of agree.
- Yeah, this is sort of lame.

07:54.648 --> 07:57.550
Well, we can fix that.
Come on, girls, let's dance.

08:00.721 --> 08:03.850
Hey, hey, hey, stop it.
You women can't dance in here.

08:03.959 --> 08:06.553
Well, I know two people
who'll take my side on this.

08:06.662 --> 08:09.860
<i>The stuffy parents from Dirty Dancing.
Right, guys?</i>

08:09.966 --> 08:12.799
Sorry, Peter. Even we're getting into it.

08:16.740 --> 08:18.708
What's the matter, Bonnie?
Don't you want to dance?

08:18.809 --> 08:22.541
Oh, it's okay, Joe.
I don't mind sitting here with you.

08:22.647 --> 08:25.878
What I mean is,
I don't want to hold you back.

08:25.984 --> 08:27.383
Don't be silly, honey.

08:27.485 --> 08:30.216
It's just as nice
watching other people have fun.

08:30.323 --> 08:32.291
God, I hate being handicapped.

08:32.390 --> 08:35.589
Sometimes, I feel more useless
than the head of the maid's union.

08:36.096 --> 08:38.121
And what exactly are your demands?

08:38.232 --> 08:42.033
- We need more Lemon Pledge.
- You need more Lemon Pledge?

08:42.135 --> 08:44.400
- Yes.
- We're not responsible for that.

08:44.505 --> 08:46.598
You should just bring it
from your own home.

08:46.708 --> 08:48.175
No.

08:52.348 --> 08:57.981
Hello? Oh, hi, Lois.
Yeah, last night was fun.

08:58.088 --> 09:01.616
Oh, it's okay. I'm used to not dancing.

09:01.726 --> 09:05.992
I mean, I knew what to expect
after, you know, Joe's accident,

09:06.097 --> 09:10.262
and I'm prepared
to live the rest of my life this way.

09:10.369 --> 09:13.668
Poor Bonnie.
She deserves so much better than me.

09:13.772 --> 09:16.037
God, she must regret this marriage.

09:16.142 --> 09:20.169
If only there was some way
for me to walk again.

09:20.280 --> 09:21.976
Wait a minute, what am I saying?

09:22.082 --> 09:25.279
There's nothing wrong with me.
I'm no different than any other guy.

09:25.386 --> 09:29.380
Joe, would you put on your hand shoes
and take out the garbage?

09:31.893 --> 09:33.190
Thank you.

09:35.000 --> 09:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:42.506 --> 09:44.167
Hey, thanks for coming with me, Peter.

09:44.274 --> 09:48.473
It sure would be wonderful
if Dr. Hartman could help me walk again.

09:48.579 --> 09:49.807
I'm sorry, Mayor McCheese,

09:49.914 --> 09:52.542
but I'm not sure
if any cosmetic surgery is even possible.

09:52.650 --> 09:55.085
- Look, if it's a financial issue...
- No, it's not an issue of money.

09:55.187 --> 09:56.916
Your head is a cheeseburger.

09:57.022 --> 09:59.889
There's no blood flow to it.
It's just... It's just dead cow meat.

09:59.992 --> 10:02.894
All right. Well, I appreciate
you giving it to me straight.

10:02.996 --> 10:04.429
All right, then. Have a tasty afternoon.

10:05.632 --> 10:07.361
Ah, there's a smile.

10:07.500 --> 10:11.232
- So, what can I do for you, Mr. Swanson?
- Doc, I can't take it anymore.

10:11.339 --> 10:13.773
I want to walk again.
I'll do whatever it takes.

10:13.874 --> 10:16.776
Well, there is
a highly experimental new procedure.

10:16.878 --> 10:18.846
It's essentially a leg transplant.

10:18.947 --> 10:21.974
If you'd be willing to sign a waiver,
I think I may be able to help you.

10:22.085 --> 10:24.713
You know, when you talk,
you sound a lot like my father-in-law,

10:24.821 --> 10:27.586
- Carter Pewterschmidt.
- Oh, that's funny. He's a patient of mine.

10:27.691 --> 10:30.216
- Here's my urine sample, Doctor.
- Thank you, Mr. Pewterschmidt.

10:30.327 --> 10:32.818
- Hi, Peter.
- You know, Peter says we sound alike.

10:32.930 --> 10:33.919
Really? I don't hear it.

10:34.032 --> 10:35.795
- Actually, I think I do hear it now.
- Really?

10:35.900 --> 10:38.664
Yeah, you know, we've never really had
any extended interaction,

10:38.770 --> 10:41.069
- so I've never noticed it.
- Hey, I think I hear it, too.

10:41.173 --> 10:42.299
Seems lazy, doesn't it?

10:42.408 --> 10:44.069
Well, there's only so many voices
in the world,

10:44.176 --> 10:45.404
some of them are bound to be similar.

10:45.878 --> 10:48.609
Now, Mr. Swanson,
through the magic of digital imaging,

10:48.715 --> 10:52.515
we'll select the legs most suited
to your body from our inventory of donors.

11:01.063 --> 11:03.793
- Hey, what about these?
- Good choice.

11:03.899 --> 11:06.299
These are the only ones we have in stock
that aren't hilarious.

11:06.402 --> 11:09.031
- I'll take them.
- Joe, you are gonna be happier

11:09.139 --> 11:11.733
than bullfrogs on vacation in Ethiopia.

11:12.542 --> 11:13.942
This is fantastic.

11:14.045 --> 11:15.842
This is even better than
they said it was in the brochure.

11:15.946 --> 11:18.710
Oh, yeah. I feel like a pig,
but, come on, we're on vacation.

11:18.816 --> 11:21.308
Exactly. Don't hate yourself.
We're on vacation, right?

11:21.420 --> 11:23.752
Yeah.
I hear Madonna's raising this guy's kid.

11:24.222 --> 11:27.954
Now, just relax, Mr. Swanson,
and let the anesthetic do its job.

11:28.061 --> 11:29.926
- All right, Doc, I trust you.
- Good.

11:30.029 --> 11:31.553
Now, I'll just pop in the how-to video,
and we'll get started.

11:31.664 --> 11:32.631
What?

11:34.302 --> 11:38.705
<i>Hi, I'm Jamie Farr,
and you're about to perform leg surgery.</i>

11:38.807 --> 11:41.333
<i>- First off, what's your name?
- Dr. Hartman.</i>

11:41.443 --> 11:44.276
<i>Great name, but I'm gonna call you '"pal'".</i>

11:44.380 --> 11:45.779
No!

11:50.287 --> 11:54.281
He's been in there an awful long time.
I hope everything's all right.

11:54.392 --> 11:58.328
My Joe's a fighter. He'll come out of this.

11:58.429 --> 12:00.864
Gentlemen, I give you
the new Joe Swanson.

12:08.836 --> 12:10.701
- Well, what do you think?
- Wow!

12:10.805 --> 12:12.830
- You look great, Joe. Holy crap!
- That's fantastic!

12:12.940 --> 12:15.432
They still got that new leg smell.

12:15.544 --> 12:17.569
I put his old legs in a bag,
if you want them.

12:17.679 --> 12:20.012
Oh, great. You know, we'll take 'em home.
We'll give 'em to Brian.

12:20.116 --> 12:23.176
- Come on, Joe. I'll drive you home.
- Are you kidding?

12:23.286 --> 12:26.187
I've got working legs
for the first time in 15 years,

12:26.289 --> 12:28.781
and I'm gonna use them.
I'm walking home.

12:28.893 --> 12:32.260
I'm sorry, Mr. Swanson, hospital rules.
You have to leave in a wheelchair.

12:40.366 --> 12:46.236
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Get some!
Get some! Yeah! Sex! Sex! Sex!

12:47.741 --> 12:52.508
- Oh, Joe, that was amazing.
- I know. I was there.

12:52.613 --> 12:57.608
My God, we haven't done it in so long.
I'd forgotten how big you were.

12:57.719 --> 12:58.913
I was gonna say the same thing to you.

13:03.679 --> 13:06.171
<i>Coming this fall on Fox,
a new reality show,</i>

13:06.283 --> 13:08.945
Who Wants to Marry Corky
from "Life Goes On"?

13:09.052 --> 13:10.815
<i>You won't believe what happened.</i>

13:12.974 --> 13:16.000
- Come on, guys, let's go!
- Go? Where are we going?

13:16.110 --> 13:18.977
Listen, these new legs
have given me my life back.

13:19.080 --> 13:22.312
I want to do all the things I could never do
when I was handicapped.

13:22.417 --> 13:26.013
And you guys are my best friends.
I want you to experience it all with me.

13:26.122 --> 13:27.680
You can count on us, Joe.

13:27.790 --> 13:29.223
Hey, what'd you do
with your old wheelchair?

13:29.325 --> 13:30.417
I gave it away.

13:30.626 --> 13:32.059
Whee!

13:35.933 --> 13:37.332
My tulips! You dick.

13:43.349 --> 13:47.116
Oh, this is great. I feel so alive.
Come on, ladies.

13:47.220 --> 13:50.986
Kick your high heels off and get moving.
You guys are a disgrace.

13:51.091 --> 13:54.289
- Peter, this doesn't seem safe.
- Yeah, I'm afraid I might...

13:59.301 --> 14:03.761
- Wow, thanks, Spider-Man.
- Everybody gets one. Tell him, Peter.

14:03.872 --> 14:06.501
- Apparently, everybody gets one.
- Bingo.

14:11.381 --> 14:14.909
- I don't know about this, Joe.
- There is no fear in this dojo!

14:15.019 --> 14:19.184
- Joe, we don't even know what a dojo is.
- There is no mercy in this dojo!

14:19.290 --> 14:22.589
- Joe, why don't you take it down a notch?
- No mercy!

14:31.570 --> 14:33.664
All right, we're gonna do it once more.

14:35.208 --> 14:38.507
And this time, no mistakes.
One, two, three, four.

14:40.481 --> 14:43.211
<i>Good morning
Good morning</i>

14:43.317 --> 14:44.978
<i>It's great to stay up late</i>

14:45.086 --> 14:48.079
<i>Good morning
Good morning to you</i>

14:49.858 --> 14:53.989
<i>When the band began to play
The stars were shining bright</i>

14:54.097 --> 14:57.965
<i>But now the milkman's on his way
It's too late to say goodnight</i>

14:58.068 --> 14:59.798
<i>So say good morning</i>

14:59.904 --> 15:03.237
<i>Good morning
Sunbeams will soon smile through</i>

15:03.340 --> 15:05.866
<i>Good morning
Good morning to you</i>

15:05.977 --> 15:07.706
<i>Nothing could be grander
than to be in Louisiana</i>

15:07.813 --> 15:09.371
<i>In the morning
In the...</i>

15:09.481 --> 15:11.312
Oh, I'm sorry,
I thought we were still going.

15:13.886 --> 15:16.150
My God, Joe is running us ragged.

15:16.255 --> 15:18.451
Yeah, I haven't been this exhausted
since I had that job

15:18.559 --> 15:21.255
as Jackée Harry's
personal grocery shopper.

15:21.695 --> 15:23.822
A pallet? Am I reading this right?

15:23.931 --> 15:27.265
You need " a pallet
of chocolate-covered pretzels"?

15:27.368 --> 15:32.136
Where the hell am I supposed to...
And what is this? "A drum of grape jam"?

15:32.241 --> 15:33.265
Is that... What is that...

15:33.375 --> 15:36.310
Is that, like, a drum, like, they ship oil in?
Is that...

15:36.412 --> 15:40.042
And look at this one,
"A desk of Cheez-lts."

15:40.150 --> 15:43.176
A desk? Where were you getting
these units of measurement from?

15:43.286 --> 15:46.745
- Mary...
- That is still funny.

15:46.858 --> 15:49.452
Okay. You stay right here, big funny gal.

15:49.560 --> 15:53.122
I'll be right back with
"a hammock of cake."

15:53.465 --> 15:57.492
<i>Yeah, Dave Matthews Live.
I'll burn you a copy. Stay cool.</i>

15:57.603 --> 16:00.437
- Hey, Joe, what you got there?
- Mountain bike.

16:00.540 --> 16:03.566
Joe, I don't know.
I'm still chafed from that power walk.

16:03.676 --> 16:06.976
Both of my inner thighs
look like those big cherry Swedish Fish.

16:07.081 --> 16:10.710
Don't worry. I'm not taking you pansies.
I'm taking my new friends.

16:10.818 --> 16:13.310
This is Parker, Quentin, and Portland.

16:13.421 --> 16:16.447
- Is Portland the black one?
- Portland is the black one.

16:16.558 --> 16:18.618
Joe, what the hell is this?

16:18.728 --> 16:21.720
Well, Peter,
I realized over the last few days

16:21.831 --> 16:26.292
the only reason I hung out with you guys
is that I was crippled and you were lazy.

16:26.403 --> 16:29.372
I decided it's time I got some friends
more suited to my status.

16:29.473 --> 16:30.440
But, Joe, we've been friends for years.

16:32.136 --> 16:36.368
Hey, we all make mistakes.
Come on, dudes, let's go exercise.

16:36.474 --> 16:37.566
- Exercise!
- Yeah!

16:37.675 --> 16:38.665
I'm gonna do sit-ups till I crap myself.

16:40.650 --> 16:43.983
I can't believe it. Joe just dumped us.
He's gone.

16:44.087 --> 16:47.251
And all we've got to remember him by
are his old legs.

16:48.459 --> 16:49.585
Okay, okay.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.902
Peter, I wish you'd go over there
and patch things up with Joe.

16:58.004 --> 16:59.164
Hey, screw him, Lois.

16:59.272 --> 17:02.207
He doesn't need us anymore,
now that he's got his cool, new friends.

17:02.308 --> 17:05.300
I tell you, those legs have turned him
into a complete jerk.

17:05.412 --> 17:08.540
It's like giving a monkey
the keys to an amusement park.

17:08.648 --> 17:10.480
- How is that?
- How is what?

17:10.584 --> 17:14.248
How is it anything like a monkey
having the keys to an amusement park?

17:14.356 --> 17:18.123
I don't know. The hours would be erratic.

17:18.227 --> 17:21.127
Maintenance would probably suffer
to some degree.

17:21.230 --> 17:23.755
The prizes for games of chance
would all be bananas.

17:23.866 --> 17:26.858
Lois, don't call me on this stuff, all right?
Just go with it.

17:26.970 --> 17:29.734
Support me in these moments.
I'm hurt. I lost my buddy.

17:29.840 --> 17:32.833
Well, Peter, there have been
a lot of changes in Joe's life,

17:32.944 --> 17:35.572
and maybe he just needed to move on.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.206
If I were you, I'd look for a new friend.

17:38.317 --> 17:41.878
A kindred spirit,
like Judas found in Pontius Pilate.

17:42.488 --> 17:44.616
You know, sometimes,
I feel like someone should just

17:44.724 --> 17:46.783
- crucify Jesus of Nazareth.
- Crucify Jesus of Nazareth.

17:46.893 --> 17:47.951
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

17:48.061 --> 17:49.824
- Shut up.
- No, you shut up.

17:49.930 --> 17:51.592
- I'm Judas.
- Pontius.

17:51.699 --> 17:53.997
This is so weird,
because just today I was thinking

17:54.101 --> 17:57.333
about how I wanted to find the son of God
and nail him to some wood.

17:57.439 --> 18:01.273
- Well, let's go find him and kick his ass.
- That sounds swell.

18:04.147 --> 18:06.911
<i>I think I'll go for a walk outside now</i>

18:07.016 --> 18:09.644
<i>The summer sun's calling my name</i>

18:12.623 --> 18:14.250
So, do you really think you're suited to be

18:14.358 --> 18:16.792
the fourth guy in our group,
Buzz Killington?

18:16.894 --> 18:19.363
Yeah, I mean, we mainly just sit here
in the booth and crack jokes,

18:19.464 --> 18:21.227
but you're kind of a buzz kill.

18:21.333 --> 18:25.930
Oh, on the contrary.
I've quite a mastery of the humorous yarn.

18:27.139 --> 18:31.440
Do any of you know the tale
of how cornmeal came to be?

18:31.545 --> 18:32.807
- No.
- No.

18:32.913 --> 18:34.380
- Uh-uh. No.
- Neither did the miller

18:34.481 --> 18:37.007
when he left his house that morning.

18:39.087 --> 18:40.952
We got to get Joe back.

18:44.893 --> 18:47.862
Joe, please, can't we talk about this?

18:47.963 --> 18:50.956
There's nothing to talk about.
I've outgrown you, Bonnie.

18:51.067 --> 18:52.694
I need to spread my legs and fly.

18:53.937 --> 18:54.926
Keep the kid.

18:57.340 --> 18:59.570
Joe, what the hell? You're leaving Bonnie?

18:59.676 --> 19:00.734
Out of my way, Peter!

19:00.844 --> 19:03.541
Me and my new friends
are gonna go surf-gliding

19:03.647 --> 19:06.275
and try to somehow work
a mountain bike in there.

19:06.383 --> 19:09.375
You've changed, Joe,
like I did when I went through puberty.

19:09.820 --> 19:12.483
Hey, you guys feel like
playing some baseball?

19:12.591 --> 19:14.684
Excuse me, I'm gonna go masturbate.

19:17.630 --> 19:18.892
And then the bastard
completely blew me off

19:18.998 --> 19:19.965
to hang out with those new douche bags.

19:21.975 --> 19:24.501
- Peter, we got to do something.
- You're right, Cleveland.

19:24.612 --> 19:29.515
Boys, there's only one answer.
We got to re-cripple Joe.

19:29.617 --> 19:32.178
It's the right thing to do,
like taking out Hitler.

19:36.492 --> 19:38.460
See? We had a plan for that all along.

19:41.030 --> 19:43.022
Bye, new awesome friends.

19:44.501 --> 19:48.267
- Bonnie, I forgot my Soloflex.
- Yo, Joe.

19:48.372 --> 19:50.466
What the hell are you doing here, pansy?

19:50.575 --> 19:54.477
- We're gonna break your legs, Joe.
- It's for your own good.

19:54.579 --> 19:56.445
Come on, guys, get him!

20:35.125 --> 20:37.219
All right, then.

20:37.329 --> 20:39.889
Bonnie. What the hell? Put my gun down.

20:39.998 --> 20:42.559
Not until I have my husband back!

20:44.170 --> 20:45.535
My perfect ass!

20:45.638 --> 20:49.097
Oh, I'm sorry, Joe.
I was aiming for your spine.

20:50.377 --> 20:54.279
- Damn it!
- Joe, I'm so sorry. I'm a terrible shot.

20:56.017 --> 20:59.509
For God's sake, just give me the gun.
I'll do it myself.

21:04.360 --> 21:06.760
Boy, we really did a number on each other.

21:06.862 --> 21:10.731
You know, I just want to take
this opportunity to apologize to you guys.

21:10.834 --> 21:16.273
I was acting like a first-class jackass.
I hope that you can forgive me.

21:16.374 --> 21:19.502
Oh, it's just good to have our old Joe back.

21:19.610 --> 21:23.479
And once our injuries heal up,
we can all go for a nice, long walk.

21:23.582 --> 21:25.345
All right! Yeah!

21:25.450 --> 21:26.883
Wait a minute...
