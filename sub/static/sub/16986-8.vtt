[music playing]

00:32.991 --> 00:37.287
- [Grug] Sandy, come to Daddy.
- [growling]

00:37.579 --> 00:38.664
Come on.

00:38.747 --> 00:42.334
Listen to the sweet sing-song
sound of my voice,

00:42.417 --> 00:45.921
never aware that
I'm about to yank you down.

00:46.004 --> 00:46.838
[hissing]

00:46.922 --> 00:49.091
That's what I get for teaching you words.

00:49.174 --> 00:50.884
Well played!
[yelps]

00:51.593 --> 00:54.388
- [grunts]
- [giggling]

00:54.471 --> 00:55.597
[blowing raspberry]

00:57.391 --> 00:59.685
- [groaning]
- [laughing]

00:59.893 --> 01:01.728
You fell right into my little trap.

01:02.771 --> 01:05.274
All right, Ugga,
Sandy is secured, chores are done.

01:05.357 --> 01:07.609
I'm gonna go watch
the winged cheetah races.

01:07.693 --> 01:12.281
Ugh. I will never get the appeal
of watching animals run around in circles.

01:12.364 --> 01:15.867
But Mom, sometimes they crash.
[giggling]

01:15.951 --> 01:18.370
- Hope they crash for you, Dad.
- [pelt tearing]

01:19.454 --> 01:23.125
That's the sound of another chore,
and my heart ripping in two.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.711
- [groaning]
- Afraid so.

01:25.794 --> 01:27.879
Would you mind killing Eep a new pelt?

01:27.963 --> 01:29.798
Sure, sure.

01:29.881 --> 01:32.718
Yeah, I'll just swing by
the hunting fields, then off to...

01:32.801 --> 01:36.930
If you're going to the fields,
can you help me throw out some old fruit?

01:37.014 --> 01:38.348
I kinda let it pile up.

01:39.266 --> 01:42.853
- Uh...
- And after that, my feets need a rubbin'.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.521
Ugh, that is not happening.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.481
Okay, look, if I speed
through those chores,

01:46.565 --> 01:48.567
- there's still a chance I can...
- Oh, I forgot.

01:48.650 --> 01:53.447
We still need water
for Sandy's "ba-a-th."

01:53.530 --> 01:54.990
[grunting, hissing]

01:55.073 --> 01:57.576
Ugh! Now she's learning sounds, too?

01:57.659 --> 01:58.785
But... come on, you guys.

01:58.869 --> 02:00.370
The winged cheetah races are...

02:00.954 --> 02:01.997
Fine.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.791
Before I go, does anyone else
need anything from me?

02:04.875 --> 02:07.127
Maybe my blood, huh?
Anything?

02:07.753 --> 02:09.463
- Huh?
- Hug?

02:10.130 --> 02:11.882
[groans]

02:19.431 --> 02:22.976
Chores, chores, chores!
I never get to do what I want.

02:23.060 --> 02:25.896
Oh, Water Me, I wish you were real.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.899
Then you could do my work
while I took a day off.

02:28.982 --> 02:32.235
[sighing] Now time to drink
your water face. G
