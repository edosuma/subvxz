00:05.820 --> 00:08.555
If there is one
thing that's for sure,

00:08.589 --> 00:11.191
it's that things often get worse

00:11.225 --> 00:12.927
before they get better.

00:13.762 --> 00:15.295
You okay?

00:15.329 --> 00:15.897
Talk to me.

00:16.898 --> 00:18.298
What's happening?

00:19.968 --> 00:21.402
Em, I'm so scared.

00:24.371 --> 00:26.340
It's gonna be okay, okay?

00:28.575 --> 00:29.911
Where are we?

00:44.491 --> 00:46.728
Mom still cooks too
much for the two of us.

00:46.761 --> 00:48.897
Old habits are hard to
break, I guess!

00:49.463 --> 00:51.265
You believe it's a habit?

00:51.298 --> 00:53.534
Maybe, maybe it's just her way

00:53.567 --> 00:55.602
of keeping dad's memories
around.

00:55.636 --> 00:57.806
She doesn't even eat the food.

00:57.839 --> 00:59.774
We have so much left over
after dinner.

01:01.843 --> 01:03.845
Well, how do you hold on
to his memories?

01:05.446 --> 01:08.348
Well, it's kind of silly,
there is this song

01:08.382 --> 01:10.350
he used to sing all the time.

01:11.019 --> 01:12.954
At home, in the car,

01:14.321 --> 01:15.824
anywhere he had
the chance really.

01:16.791 --> 01:18.592
Now when I hear it,

01:18.625 --> 01:20.995
all I hear is his voice
over the singer.

01:21.029 --> 01:22.596
It's like it's his song.

01:22.629 --> 01:23.932
My dad's song.

01:24.431 --> 01:26.233
I forget that
it's by a real band.

01:27.001 --> 01:29.403
Do you two talk about him often?

01:29.436 --> 01:31.840
Not really, sometimes.

01:31.873 --> 01:34.241
Well, she doesn't really like
talking about it.

01:34.843 --> 01:36.643
Why do you think that is?

01:37.578 --> 01:40.380
Because she doesn't
have all of the answers.

01:42.684 --> 01:44.284
To what questions?

01:47.454 --> 01:49.389
Do you think
we'll see Dad again?

01:53.460 --> 01:55.395
She used to be religious.

01:55.429 --> 01:56.965
Pray all the time.

01:56.998 --> 01:58.867
Heaven is what kept
her faith alive.

01:59.500 --> 02:02.302
But now,

02:02.336 --> 02:04.638
I don't know anymore.

02:05.372 --> 02:07.508
May be you two
should talk about it.

02:08.743 --> 02:10.678
She doesn't really like
talking about

02:10.711 --> 02:12.847
what happens after people die.

02:17.451 --> 02:19.586
Sounds like your Mom is here.

02:23.958 --> 02:25.392
Come here.

02:28.096 --> 02:29.596
Be tough, okay?

02:30.631 --> 02:32.934
She needs you now
more than ever.

03:09.570 --> 03:11.538
<i>Do you think
we'll see Dad again?</i>

03:16.978 --> 03:18.478
Do you think
we'll see Dad again?

03:20.849 --> 03:23.051
Oh, we saw him today, honey!

03:28.422 --> 03:31.092
I mean like here, with us.

03:33.527 --> 03:35.730
I certainly like to think so.

03:37.531 --> 03:39.433
You said he was waiting
in a special place.

03:42.003 --> 03:43.403
In heaven.

03:43.437 --> 03:44.839
We'll be a family again.

03:50.945 --> 03:52.379
One day!

04:15.870 --> 04:18.740
My mom once told me,

04:18.773 --> 04:21.475
if you've every felt like
life had no meaning,

04:22.176 --> 04:24.679
that things don't quite add up.

04:25.880 --> 04:28.515
Just stop and take a listen.

04:29.817 --> 04:32.687
There are moments,
buried in silence.

04:49.771 --> 04:51.039
I love you!

05:07.021 --> 05:08.256
Ready to go?

05:25.073 --> 05:26.506
Okay, knock knock.

05:26.540 --> 05:27.275
Who is there?

05:27.308 --> 05:28.710
Interrupting ghost.

05:28.743 --> 05:29.711
- Interrupting...
- Boo!

05:33.580 --> 05:35.883
You told your class
I'm your hero?

05:35.917 --> 05:37.617
I want to be like you, supermom!

05:39.721 --> 05:42.489
I'm no super hero,
that's you!

05:43.791 --> 05:45.193
You're the real hero.

06:11.352 --> 06:13.054
Dr. EVANS: Loss of vision
can be a difficult situation

06:13.087 --> 06:14.621
for her to adapt to.

06:16.991 --> 06:18.793
Well, could her sight
ever return?

06:19.927 --> 06:21.796
I think the vision
that she has now,

06:21.829 --> 06:23.765
is probably as good
as it's gonna get.

06:26.868 --> 06:29.103
Well, can some sort of
procedure be done?

06:31.305 --> 06:34.042
I strongly advise against it.

06:34.075 --> 06:36.210
We don't even know
if any procedure

06:36.244 --> 06:38.312
would have any effect
on her vision at all.

06:41.382 --> 06:44.085
Now Lillian is gonna go
through stages, denial,

06:44.118 --> 06:46.254
anger would be the toughest.

06:47.321 --> 06:50.091
Depression will be terrible
if not dealt with properly.

06:51.993 --> 06:53.861
Have to get her to acceptance.

06:57.965 --> 07:00.001
This isn't fair.

07:00.034 --> 07:01.869
Now Rebecca,
you have to give her hope.

07:04.005 --> 07:06.074
You have to prepare her
for what's coming up.

07:06.908 --> 07:08.676
I have a good friend
that can help.

07:10.144 --> 07:13.081
Mom, mom.

07:16.317 --> 07:18.119
Hello sweet heart,
I'm here.

07:18.886 --> 07:19.720
Aunt Becca?

07:19.754 --> 07:20.922
Yeah.

07:20.955 --> 07:22.290
I'm here kiddo.

07:25.793 --> 07:27.361
I can't open my eyes.

07:29.430 --> 07:30.865
I want to see my mom.

07:30.898 --> 07:31.866
I know.

07:35.736 --> 07:37.004
It'll be okay.

07:39.240 --> 07:40.341
We'll be okay.

08:03.097 --> 08:05.133
What do you remember after?

08:06.033 --> 08:08.369
My mom's voice,

08:08.402 --> 08:10.304
calling for me.

08:12.140 --> 08:13.875
What did you do?

08:14.242 --> 08:16.043
I got out of the car.

08:18.412 --> 08:20.281
Could you see anything?

08:21.749 --> 08:24.252
No, but I could still hear
my mom's voice.

08:26.087 --> 08:27.688
What did she say?

08:29.790 --> 08:31.692
"Come to me, Lilly."

08:34.761 --> 08:36.764
You followed you mom's voice?

08:38.799 --> 08:41.402
Yeah,
and I heard a loud explosion

08:41.434 --> 08:43.938
and that's all I remember.

08:57.251 --> 08:58.419
How was she today?

08:59.220 --> 09:02.190
Well, there was a small
improvement.

09:03.291 --> 09:05.760
Samantha, Lilly she um...

09:06.260 --> 09:07.929
Voices again?

09:11.399 --> 09:14.268
This morning, at the store

09:15.102 --> 09:18.005
she asked if her friend
can come with us.

09:19.974 --> 09:22.877
Hmm, well,
it's normal for children her age

09:22.910 --> 09:25.780
to have imaginary friends.

09:26.514 --> 09:29.383
Umm, considering
her circumstances

09:29.417 --> 09:31.118
it might be healthy for Lilly.

09:34.488 --> 09:35.990
I'm just worried
that she believes

09:36.023 --> 09:37.258
these people are real.

09:38.826 --> 09:41.395
There are many case studies
of children

09:42.830 --> 09:45.333
inventing imaginary friends
to help them cope

09:46.000 --> 09:48.002
with a traumatic experience.

09:49.203 --> 09:50.771
She will grow out of it.

09:56.043 --> 09:58.145
The other day at Kelly's house.

10:01.282 --> 10:03.451
Lilly described
something like she could see it.

10:05.486 --> 10:07.955
She said the voices told her.

10:10.491 --> 10:12.860
It's normal for someone

10:12.893 --> 10:15.896
with Lilly's condition,

10:15.930 --> 10:18.132
to develop heightened hearing.

10:18.165 --> 10:20.301
She could have
overheard a conversation.

10:22.603 --> 10:25.539
It's just how her body

10:25.573 --> 10:28.876
is adapting.

10:28.909 --> 10:30.811
I just don't want
her to believe everything

10:30.845 --> 10:32.980
she hears is true, you know.

10:33.014 --> 10:35.583
That the world is what
these voices are telling her.

10:37.418 --> 10:39.053
Hello?

10:39.086 --> 10:41.555
I mean what if one day

10:41.589 --> 10:43.824
she is crossing the street
and she thinks

10:43.858 --> 10:44.959
it's safe but it's not.

10:44.992 --> 10:47.895
It's just I want her to...

10:47.928 --> 10:49.230
To see?

10:51.065 --> 10:51.999
Yeah.

10:52.466 --> 10:54.568
Rebecca,

10:54.602 --> 10:57.405
Lilly is going through
a very tough time.

10:58.939 --> 11:01.142
These hardships

11:01.175 --> 11:04.078
fall on family members,
too.

11:06.480 --> 11:08.182
Why are you crying?

11:13.054 --> 11:14.922
I made a terrible mistake.

11:16.524 --> 11:18.259
Is that why you're crying?

11:19.226 --> 11:20.328
Yes.

11:21.362 --> 11:23.197
What's your name?

11:23.230 --> 11:24.365
Alison.

11:25.667 --> 11:27.335
Mine is Lilly.

11:27.368 --> 11:29.070
I lost my baby.

11:33.274 --> 11:35.242
I'm a terrible mother.

11:37.912 --> 11:39.246
Can I be your baby?

11:41.582 --> 11:43.417
Can I be your baby?

11:43.451 --> 11:45.386
Take me home with you.

11:47.455 --> 11:48.389
Aunt Becca.

11:48.422 --> 11:49.523
Take me home with you.

11:49.557 --> 11:50.925
Aunt Becca.

11:52.426 --> 11:54.095
Lil, you okay?

11:54.128 --> 11:56.263
She was yelling at me.

11:56.297 --> 11:57.666
Who was yelling at you?

11:57.699 --> 11:59.100
Alison.

12:21.122 --> 12:22.356
Just breathe.

12:23.057 --> 12:23.924
You're okay.

12:24.693 --> 12:25.993
You're okay.

12:29.363 --> 12:30.665
Do you like music?

12:36.604 --> 12:39.573
Lilly, when you hear voices

12:39.607 --> 12:41.108
that make you uncomfortable.

12:41.142 --> 12:42.977
I want you to put these on.

12:43.010 --> 12:45.479
They will make
the bad voices go away.

12:59.226 --> 13:00.561
There you are.

13:03.765 --> 13:05.065
Hi.

13:05.466 --> 13:06.133
Hi.

13:08.502 --> 13:09.370
Today's session?

13:10.104 --> 13:10.938
TED Talk.

13:11.773 --> 13:12.640
Really?

13:12.674 --> 13:13.607
Who is the speaker?

13:13.641 --> 13:15.409
Oh, William Arden.

13:17.211 --> 13:18.012
Uhuh?

13:18.045 --> 13:18.979
Hmm.

13:19.480 --> 13:20.548
I wish.

13:21.415 --> 13:23.584
Your design is brilliant.

13:23.617 --> 13:25.453
You'll be the one
on that stage soon

13:25.486 --> 13:27.388
explaining how
you changed the lives

13:27.421 --> 13:30.057
for so many people
with disabilities.

13:30.558 --> 13:33.093
I am not much of a stage person,

13:33.127 --> 13:35.029
you know that.

13:35.062 --> 13:36.530
And I really hope
they don't drag me up

13:36.564 --> 13:37.998
during the banquet.

13:38.032 --> 13:40.201
Oh, it's only right
that you should speak.

13:43.537 --> 13:45.172
I just feel awkward,

13:45.206 --> 13:47.107
standing there in front
of all those people.

13:47.141 --> 13:48.476
The more that I talk,
the more I feel like

13:48.509 --> 13:49.977
it's just a charity case.

13:50.578 --> 13:52.313
Why do you say that?

13:52.346 --> 13:54.315
Because half of those people
only care about

13:54.348 --> 13:55.684
the profits.

13:55.717 --> 13:58.052
What about the other half
who don't?

14:04.525 --> 14:06.695
I guess they are the ones
who are really listening.

14:33.487 --> 14:35.657
Can you see the lights?

14:35.690 --> 14:37.692
Well, I can make it out
just enough to see

14:37.726 --> 14:39.393
when I need to cross.

14:39.426 --> 14:41.328
Do you want me to push
the button, miss?

14:41.362 --> 14:43.597
Oh, I got it,
thank you though.

15:23.370 --> 15:25.506
Well, excuse me,
can you tell me

15:25.539 --> 15:27.508
where the children's
bedtime books are?

15:28.242 --> 15:30.110
Oh, I'm sorry

15:30.144 --> 15:31.846
I don't actually work here.

15:31.880 --> 15:34.381
Oh no, I thought you did.

15:34.415 --> 15:35.416
I'm so sorry.

15:36.650 --> 15:38.419
I would imagine it's close.

15:38.452 --> 15:41.255
Umm, I'd try a few rows over.

15:43.290 --> 15:44.693
You sure you don't work here?

15:44.726 --> 15:45.526
I'm sure.

15:45.559 --> 15:48.329
Okay, thank you umm...

15:48.362 --> 15:49.430
Lillian.

15:49.463 --> 15:50.765
Lillian.

15:50.799 --> 15:51.733
Jerry Morris.

15:56.470 --> 15:58.873
Uh, by the way

15:58.907 --> 16:00.307
do you have
any suggestions for uh,

16:00.341 --> 16:01.308
a 9-year-old?

16:02.309 --> 16:04.244
Ooh, that's a tough one.

16:05.212 --> 16:08.115
Um, Matilda would be mine.

16:09.050 --> 16:11.753
Okay, I'll have to remember
that title then.

16:12.553 --> 16:14.588
Thank you very much,
you have a great day.

16:14.622 --> 16:15.757
You as well.

16:19.894 --> 16:22.296
Never being able to see again

16:22.329 --> 16:23.698
I thought it was the end.

16:23.732 --> 16:25.432
But it wasn't the end
of the road.

16:25.734 --> 16:27.568
It was just a different path.

16:46.655 --> 16:47.722
Hey there.

16:47.756 --> 16:48.923
Hi.

16:50.725 --> 16:51.960
What's your name?

16:51.993 --> 16:53.160
Lilly.

16:53.862 --> 16:54.796
Lilly?

16:56.263 --> 16:58.767
I'm kind of lost,
need some directions.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.434
Do you think you can help me?

17:00.467 --> 17:01.602
I can try.

17:06.339 --> 17:09.343
I'm looking for
the elementary school nearby.

17:09.376 --> 17:11.211
I have to pick up my niece Lisa.

17:11.244 --> 17:12.413
She is actually about your age.

17:12.445 --> 17:13.815
Do you go to that school?

17:13.848 --> 17:15.884
No, I don't go to school.

17:15.916 --> 17:17.251
I'm taught from home.

17:18.618 --> 17:19.921
That's nice.

17:19.954 --> 17:21.320
Do you think
you can help show me

17:21.355 --> 17:22.790
where the school might be?

17:22.824 --> 17:24.425
I really need to pick her up.

17:25.926 --> 17:27.461
Maybe you can come with me.

17:28.494 --> 17:30.264
You and Lisa could be friends.

17:31.632 --> 17:32.967
Can I help you?

17:34.769 --> 17:36.637
I was just asking
this kind little lady here

17:36.671 --> 17:37.706
for directions.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.675
I haven't seen you
around here before.

17:41.508 --> 17:43.410
I'm just passing through.

17:43.878 --> 17:45.546
I think I can find my way
from here.

17:46.380 --> 17:47.648
Good.

17:59.928 --> 18:02.429
Hey kiddo, why don't we go in?

18:05.466 --> 18:07.035
How about we work on a puzzle?

18:23.584 --> 18:25.754
Well, what happened?

18:29.758 --> 18:32.526
Jerry, some kids have
all the luck in the world.

18:53.715 --> 18:55.382
Lillian Arden?

18:55.415 --> 18:56.650
Can I help you?

18:56.684 --> 18:59.486
I'm Diana Lee,
I have an appointment at 2:00.

18:59.520 --> 19:00.587
You're early.

19:00.621 --> 19:01.622
Well, I take the bus.

19:01.656 --> 19:03.323
You know,
they're never on time.

19:03.357 --> 19:05.626
So uh,
I left little early today.

19:05.660 --> 19:06.761
Is that okay?

19:06.795 --> 19:08.529
Oh, I can certainly
understand that.

19:08.562 --> 19:09.596
Please come in.

19:14.669 --> 19:16.603
Some days are better
than others.

19:19.741 --> 19:22.543
It's just hard to move
forward without him.

19:23.644 --> 19:25.947
It will get easier
as time passes.

19:27.882 --> 19:28.950
Lillian.

19:29.516 --> 19:30.484
Lilly.

19:31.451 --> 19:34.321
Lilly, are you spiritual?

19:36.590 --> 19:39.027
I am open

19:39.060 --> 19:40.862
to the possibility.

19:42.563 --> 19:44.598
Do you know what happens
when people die?

19:45.800 --> 19:47.836
I read that you are a medium.

19:48.970 --> 19:49.938
Was.

19:50.370 --> 19:52.040
Why did you stop?

19:54.441 --> 19:56.678
Tragedies are a part of life.

19:57.644 --> 19:58.847
Gives you character.

20:00.782 --> 20:01.983
Then there is some
that give you hope

20:02.016 --> 20:04.384
in a strange way.

20:05.653 --> 20:07.956
Some that tear you down,

20:07.989 --> 20:09.824
break every bit of your heart,

20:09.858 --> 20:11.558
destroy our soul.

20:12.559 --> 20:15.429
Make you give up on hope,

20:15.964 --> 20:18.398
purpose, on life.

20:20.902 --> 20:23.403
Someone told me

20:23.437 --> 20:25.039
you have to adapt to life.

20:29.110 --> 20:31.913
There is no adapting to this.

20:32.646 --> 20:35.683
I believe you can overcome
anything.

20:39.988 --> 20:41.890
Do you have kids, Lilly?

20:48.963 --> 20:50.064
Hi.

20:50.098 --> 20:51.099
Hey.

20:51.132 --> 20:53.067
Can I walk with you?

20:53.101 --> 20:54.501
Oh, where are you headed?

20:54.534 --> 20:55.569
I'm heading home.

20:55.602 --> 20:57.672
It's just a few blocks that way.

20:57.972 --> 21:00.407
Sure, I could use the company.

21:00.842 --> 21:03.044
My name's Madison,
what's yours?

21:03.077 --> 21:04.812
It's a pleasure
to meet you Madison.

21:04.846 --> 21:05.780
I'm Lilly.

21:07.547 --> 21:09.616
Your parents let you wander off
this far from home?

21:09.650 --> 21:11.518
I was looking for Mr. Wiggy.

21:11.551 --> 21:12.720
Mr. Wiggy?

21:12.754 --> 21:14.656
Yeah, he is my cat.

21:14.689 --> 21:15.957
He's always jumping
out of our window

21:15.990 --> 21:17.191
and disappearing.

21:18.259 --> 21:19.727
Did you find him?

21:19.761 --> 21:21.896
Nah, usually
when I don't find him,

21:21.930 --> 21:23.798
I leave a treat out of my room.

21:23.831 --> 21:25.599
And he always finds
his way home.

21:25.632 --> 21:27.601
Oh well, it's good that he knows
where home is.

21:29.603 --> 21:30.972
Friends of yours?

21:31.005 --> 21:33.908
No, Mr. Wiggy is my only friend.

21:33.942 --> 21:35.877
Oh, he'll find his way home.

21:36.678 --> 21:39.080
Is it hard for you to walk
whenever you can't see?

21:39.747 --> 21:41.849
Oh, depends on the weather.

21:41.883 --> 21:44.152
It can be difficult in the rain.

21:44.185 --> 21:45.619
But most of the time
it's really easy

21:45.653 --> 21:46.955
because of my cane.

21:46.988 --> 21:49.891
Have you ever walked in
to anything before?

21:49.924 --> 21:50.858
When I was younger.

21:50.892 --> 21:51.558
Like what?

21:51.591 --> 21:53.061
Oh, monkey bars.

21:53.094 --> 21:54.963
- Did it hurt?
- Yes.

21:57.564 --> 21:59.734
Well, I hope you don't run
into anymore things

21:59.767 --> 22:01.102
that hurt you.

22:01.135 --> 22:02.870
Well, thank you.

22:02.904 --> 22:04.105
I'll try not to.

22:04.138 --> 22:05.505
This is it for me.

22:05.539 --> 22:07.108
Yeah, this where you live?

22:07.141 --> 22:08.542
Yeah.

22:08.575 --> 22:10.111
Are you new
to the neighborhood?

22:10.144 --> 22:11.645
Kind of.

22:11.679 --> 22:14.514
Well, I walk this way
all the time.

22:15.183 --> 22:16.884
I'll keep an ear out
for Mr. Wiggy.

22:16.918 --> 22:17.986
Thank you.

22:18.019 --> 22:19.887
Thank you
for keeping me company.

22:19.921 --> 22:20.922
I really enjoyed it.

22:20.955 --> 22:22.657
You're welcome.

22:22.690 --> 22:24.225
Alright, good luck
with Mr. Wiggy.

22:30.765 --> 22:33.201
I've seen you,
I've seen you sing Karaoke,

22:33.234 --> 22:33.901
and dude like it's...

22:33.935 --> 22:35.937
Oh my God.

22:36.536 --> 22:38.106
That's the only reason
I only do it once a year.

22:38.139 --> 22:39.207
- I think you're good.
- Oh wait, wait.

22:39.240 --> 22:40.775
You guys, alright,
so what's the verdict?

22:40.808 --> 22:41.476
What happened?

22:41.508 --> 22:43.745
Well, she just put 'em to bed.

22:43.778 --> 22:45.612
That should give Anne
a few hours of rest,

22:45.645 --> 22:46.613
but I should leave.

22:46.646 --> 22:49.283
I feel guilty leaving her alone
with the twins.

22:49.317 --> 22:51.886
You guys need a break
every now and then.

22:51.919 --> 22:54.521
Yeah, next time you stay home
and let Anne come.

22:55.723 --> 22:57.557
Hey it must be tough.

22:58.059 --> 23:00.762
At times it is,
but then I look at their faces.

23:03.097 --> 23:05.700
Bringing something like that
into this world?

23:05.733 --> 23:07.168
No words can describe it.

23:08.236 --> 23:10.071
I can only imagine, man.

23:10.104 --> 23:11.739
Those kids are incredible.

23:11.773 --> 23:12.874
Thanks, bro.

23:12.907 --> 23:13.841
You must feel really proud.

23:13.875 --> 23:14.809
I am.

23:15.510 --> 23:17.611
Next time,
let's do it at my place.

23:17.644 --> 23:18.112
Definitely.

23:18.146 --> 23:19.213
I had a good time.

23:19.247 --> 23:20.248
Let me walk you out.

23:20.281 --> 23:21.315
Alright, see you later.

23:21.349 --> 23:22.817
- See you, bud.
- Have a good night.

23:22.850 --> 23:23.985
Oh, tell Anne I said hi.

23:24.018 --> 23:24.952
I will.

23:33.861 --> 23:35.963
Thanks for coming out, man.

23:35.997 --> 23:37.732
Give Anne and the twins my love.

23:37.765 --> 23:40.668
You know,
they're gonna need friends soon?

23:40.701 --> 23:42.670
Maybe you and Lilly
should start thinking about it.

23:43.871 --> 23:44.872
Actually.

23:48.810 --> 23:50.278
Can you just...

23:50.311 --> 23:52.646
Can we talk about
relationship for a second?

23:52.680 --> 23:54.148
I mean I want to know
about compromise.

23:54.182 --> 23:56.150
Like where does it stand?

23:56.184 --> 23:56.884
Well, first you have to...

23:56.918 --> 23:57.985
- Oh, there he is.
- Okay.

23:58.019 --> 23:58.920
Will, right?

23:58.953 --> 23:59.854
Come on.

23:59.887 --> 24:01.923
- Uh, yes.
- So.

24:01.956 --> 24:03.191
I don't know,
what am I agreeing to?

24:03.224 --> 24:04.025
What happened?

24:04.058 --> 24:06.661
Uh, Emily is giving her

24:06.694 --> 24:08.296
co-worker relationship
advice.

24:08.329 --> 24:09.764
So we are talking
about compromise.

24:09.797 --> 24:11.199
Oh.

24:11.232 --> 24:12.366
You got to have compromise
in a relationship.

24:12.400 --> 24:14.769
It's a give and take
partnership, alright.

24:14.802 --> 24:16.237
Yeah, well in Emily's case,

24:16.270 --> 24:18.739
it's more of a take and take
partnership.

24:18.773 --> 24:20.374
- Oh.
- Oh.

24:21.175 --> 24:24.345
Finding common ground
is a constant task,

24:24.378 --> 24:26.881
but if you're not even
considering sharing

24:26.914 --> 24:29.283
the same shore as your partner

24:29.317 --> 24:31.285
it's never gonna work.

24:31.319 --> 24:32.887
Especially if you are trying
to start a family.

24:33.921 --> 24:36.958
That's the most insightful thing
you've said all night.

24:36.991 --> 24:39.694
I'm ready to share common ground
whenever you are.

24:40.995 --> 24:43.064
Well, I think when you find
the right person,

24:43.097 --> 24:45.933
even a moment away from them
is a moment that's too long.

24:45.967 --> 24:47.335
And you will find
that no amount of time

24:47.368 --> 24:48.903
you get to spend
with that person is ever

24:48.936 --> 24:50.104
gonna be enough.

24:50.138 --> 24:52.340
And that's when you'll realize
how short life really is.

24:54.175 --> 24:55.343
Taking notes?

24:58.980 --> 25:00.348
I do love this house.

25:01.415 --> 25:02.316
Yeah?

25:04.051 --> 25:05.253
I've never seen it.

25:06.821 --> 25:07.889
You dork.

25:09.824 --> 25:11.292
It's so grand though.

25:11.325 --> 25:12.293
Oh.

25:12.994 --> 25:15.296
Well, my parents left me
quite a bit.

25:15.930 --> 25:18.199
I didn't really earn all this.

25:19.267 --> 25:21.903
They wanted to make sure
you were all taken care of.

25:22.570 --> 25:24.438
That's what amazing parents do.

25:25.306 --> 25:26.240
True.

25:27.508 --> 25:29.243
Speaking of parents,

25:29.677 --> 25:31.913
you two have a lot of space
here,

25:31.946 --> 25:34.348
but it's missing something,
you know.

25:35.783 --> 25:36.217
Oh yeah?

25:36.250 --> 25:37.151
What's that?

25:38.052 --> 25:40.154
Come on, Lil,

25:40.188 --> 25:41.856
you two are perfect for it.

25:42.890 --> 25:44.692
I can see it in your eyes, girl.

25:45.393 --> 25:46.994
No, you can't,
I'm wearing glasses.

25:47.028 --> 25:48.462
You know what I mean!

25:49.096 --> 25:51.098
So you're just gonna shove off

25:51.132 --> 25:53.201
the burden of the
next generation on to me, huh?

25:53.234 --> 25:53.968
- Ahan.
- Ahan.

25:55.369 --> 25:56.470
Being a nurse,

25:56.504 --> 25:58.272
you're around babies
all the time.

25:58.639 --> 26:00.441
I can't say that
hasn't rubbed off on you?

26:00.474 --> 26:02.810
Oh, mm-mm.

26:03.711 --> 26:06.047
Honey, ain't no babies
coming out of all this.

26:06.080 --> 26:07.815
Not happening.

26:07.848 --> 26:10.785
Besides I'm more into
the whole Aunt Emily thing.

26:10.818 --> 26:13.087
Come on, you really
don't want kids?

26:14.488 --> 26:16.357
I um,

26:19.260 --> 26:20.795
I can't have kids.

26:21.963 --> 26:23.231
What?

26:23.264 --> 26:25.299
"Low ovarian reserve",
they call it.

26:28.302 --> 26:30.104
When did you find out?

26:30.471 --> 26:31.973
A while back.

26:33.174 --> 26:34.008
Em.

26:34.041 --> 26:35.209
Hey, it's okay.

26:35.243 --> 26:36.310
I'm sorry.

26:36.344 --> 26:38.346
Listen like I said,

26:38.379 --> 26:40.481
Auntie Em is cool with me.

26:43.217 --> 26:44.151
Okay?

26:46.420 --> 26:48.422
Well,

26:48.456 --> 26:50.825
this is gonna be awkward.

26:50.858 --> 26:51.926
Awkward?

26:51.959 --> 26:54.428
Um,

26:54.462 --> 26:57.465
what I'm about to say.

26:57.498 --> 27:00.434
How would you rank
your aunt skills

27:00.468 --> 27:03.404
on a scale of one to ten?

27:03.437 --> 27:04.905
One hundred.

27:07.074 --> 27:07.808
Wait!

27:07.842 --> 27:08.476
What?

27:08.509 --> 27:09.477
Are you kidding me?

27:11.012 --> 27:12.213
Are you serious?

27:12.246 --> 27:13.514
Girl,
don't you kid me like that!

27:14.615 --> 27:15.983
Oh my God!

27:16.017 --> 27:16.584
I'm not kidding.

27:16.617 --> 27:17.818
Oh my God!

27:18.119 --> 27:19.854
We're gonna have a baby!

27:19.887 --> 27:22.556
- Oh, you're gonna have a baby!
- Yeah, I am.

27:26.427 --> 27:28.496
Oh, wow.

27:28.529 --> 27:30.464
You are gonna be
the most amazing aunt.

27:30.498 --> 27:32.199
Oh, this is the best news ever.

27:33.067 --> 27:35.136
Life is perfect.

27:35.169 --> 27:38.005
But I always felt
something was wrong.

27:41.142 --> 27:43.577
You know, have you thought
about yourself lately?

27:43.611 --> 27:45.379
You know,
maybe starting your own family?

27:46.447 --> 27:48.249
I'm the only family Lilly has.

27:48.282 --> 27:50.351
I mean I have to be there
for her.

27:50.384 --> 27:52.520
Yeah, you should be there
for her.

27:52.553 --> 27:53.587
You know,
maybe she needs some siblings

27:53.621 --> 27:54.455
to play with.

27:55.657 --> 27:58.192
With all of Lil's appointments
and needs.

27:59.160 --> 28:01.395
It's impossible to think
about that right now.

28:04.666 --> 28:06.100
Hey, you want to play tag?

28:06.133 --> 28:06.901
Sure.

28:16.410 --> 28:17.311
Closer.

28:24.485 --> 28:25.286
Closer.

28:27.922 --> 28:28.956
Almost there.

28:41.670 --> 28:42.671
Lil!

28:55.249 --> 28:57.451
Lil, how many times
have I told you

28:57.485 --> 28:58.953
not to play near the pool?!

28:58.986 --> 29:00.488
I'm sorry.

29:02.323 --> 29:03.457
Thank you.

29:05.259 --> 29:06.894
Come on let's go get your stuff.

29:52.406 --> 29:55.376
Hey, kiddo,

29:55.409 --> 29:57.144
I've got an idea.

29:57.178 --> 29:58.012
Yeah?

29:58.512 --> 29:59.447
Yeah.

30:02.751 --> 30:04.485
You're gonna learn
how to swim today.

30:05.754 --> 30:07.455
I can't see the water.

30:08.422 --> 30:10.257
You don't have to see it.

30:11.125 --> 30:13.060
You just need to feel it.

30:20.034 --> 30:22.269
Just breathe slowly,

30:22.303 --> 30:24.171
let your body adapt
to the water.

30:24.205 --> 30:25.973
Now move your arms and legs.

30:26.640 --> 30:27.676
I'm floating!

30:27.709 --> 30:30.611
Yeah, you got it!

30:33.481 --> 30:36.317
Oh wait, woah, woah, woah, woah,
don't give up halfway.

30:36.350 --> 30:37.418
Just relax.

30:39.353 --> 30:40.655
There you go.

30:40.689 --> 30:42.056
Who is a little fish?

30:42.423 --> 30:44.659
Come to me, hear my voice.

30:44.693 --> 30:46.160
Come to me, come to me.

30:46.193 --> 30:47.194
You got it, you got it.

30:47.228 --> 30:48.095
You got it.

30:48.529 --> 30:49.597
That's my girl.

30:52.533 --> 30:54.034
Give me your hands.

30:56.437 --> 30:57.304
You feel that?

30:59.206 --> 31:01.609
Feel how the water adapts
to the shape of your hands?

31:02.777 --> 31:04.078
Yeah.

31:06.514 --> 31:08.516
Got to do that with your life.

31:11.753 --> 31:14.221
No matter what hardships
or failures

31:14.255 --> 31:15.322
you might face,

31:16.557 --> 31:19.059
if you adapt to it

31:19.093 --> 31:20.261
you'll overcome it.

31:28.402 --> 31:30.772
Tell me what you remember
about that day?

31:34.743 --> 31:37.044
He loved going to conventions.

31:37.712 --> 31:40.447
Planets, rockets, and space

31:40.481 --> 31:42.116
were his life.

31:44.753 --> 31:46.487
He was gonna be a scientist.

31:50.391 --> 31:52.694
We got off the bus,

31:52.727 --> 31:54.128
and I met an old client.

31:55.296 --> 31:56.798
She wanted a quick reading.

31:58.833 --> 32:01.635
I took my eyes off of him
for just a moment.

32:02.636 --> 32:04.238
Just for a moment.

32:06.675 --> 32:08.242
And then I heard it.

32:10.277 --> 32:11.579
And then I felt it.

32:13.447 --> 32:15.850
And when I turned around there
he was laying on the ground.

32:17.451 --> 32:19.553
You shouldn't blame yourself.

32:21.589 --> 32:23.490
I felt something strong
that day.

32:23.524 --> 32:26.327
Something was warning me
and I didn't wanna go.

32:28.195 --> 32:30.230
But he asked me
and he was begging

32:30.264 --> 32:31.766
"Mommy please..."

32:33.902 --> 32:36.671
Do you feel you could have done
something to prevent it?

32:39.340 --> 32:42.242
I have a gift,

32:42.276 --> 32:43.477
but I ignored the warnings.

32:45.212 --> 32:47.581
I was too busy being a medium
instead of being a mother.

32:48.717 --> 32:50.384
Accidents happen.

32:52.787 --> 32:54.689
I won't ignore
the warnings again.

32:55.924 --> 32:58.425
In situations like this,

32:58.459 --> 33:00.194
you have to forgive yourself.

33:01.395 --> 33:04.298
We've all made mistakes
that we wish

33:04.331 --> 33:05.532
we could take back.

33:06.835 --> 33:07.902
You can hear him.

33:08.803 --> 33:10.304
I'm sorry?

33:10.337 --> 33:12.807
At the bus stop,
you can hear him.

33:14.475 --> 33:15.710
You can hear them.

33:16.845 --> 33:17.746
David can move on.

33:17.779 --> 33:19.380
We could be a family again.

33:19.413 --> 33:21.883
Diana,
you're not making any sense.

33:21.916 --> 33:23.517
You are special.

33:24.218 --> 33:26.387
You can give them
a second chance.

33:28.589 --> 33:30.491
I can't believe it's you.

33:31.258 --> 33:33.962
I mean it must have been fate
that brought us together.

33:33.995 --> 33:35.930
David can live on.

33:35.964 --> 33:37.431
Live on?

33:37.464 --> 33:38.432
In you.

33:40.434 --> 33:43.303
Um, I believe
we are going to need

33:43.337 --> 33:44.839
to cut things short today.

33:44.873 --> 33:47.842
Lilly, listen to me,

33:47.876 --> 33:49.844
David can live on

33:49.878 --> 33:51.211
and you can choose.

33:51.245 --> 33:53.514
Yes, and I choose
for you to leave.

33:53.547 --> 33:55.817
No, you can choose the soul

33:55.850 --> 33:57.752
for your baby.

33:57.786 --> 33:59.854
Look, Diana,
I can get you extra help.

33:59.888 --> 34:01.388
David needs your help.

34:01.422 --> 34:02.857
Diana, calm down.

34:02.891 --> 34:04.826
I know you're upset about David.

34:04.859 --> 34:06.928
Look, you have to choose
before the first heartbeat.

34:06.961 --> 34:09.228
Please, please choose David.

34:09.263 --> 34:09.931
Listen to me.

34:09.964 --> 34:11.297
No, you're not listening to me.

34:11.331 --> 34:12.701
You don't have much time.

34:12.734 --> 34:14.703
I can't help you
if you won't listen to me.

34:14.735 --> 34:17.371
I'm telling you
how you can help me please.

34:17.404 --> 34:18.272
He needs your help!

34:18.304 --> 34:19.774
Diana, just stop.

34:19.808 --> 34:21.574
I want my son back!

34:21.608 --> 34:23.243
Stop, you're hurting me!

34:25.714 --> 34:26.848
I'm sorry.

34:27.648 --> 34:28.549
I'm sorry.

34:31.452 --> 34:33.387
I just wanted to touch him
one more time.

34:36.791 --> 34:37.891
Just go.

35:00.581 --> 35:02.649
That shit is not cool.

35:02.684 --> 35:04.284
That bitch assaulted you.

35:04.318 --> 35:05.419
I'm fine.

35:05.452 --> 35:07.454
She attacked you
in your own house!

35:07.488 --> 35:09.858
Goddammit, Lil,
she's a crazy patient,

35:09.891 --> 35:11.659
you shouldn't see her again.

35:11.693 --> 35:12.961
You're overreacting.

35:12.994 --> 35:13.995
She needs help.

35:14.028 --> 35:15.529
Uh, no.

35:16.497 --> 35:18.532
I could hear it in her voice.

35:19.366 --> 35:20.735
What do you mean?

35:21.870 --> 35:24.438
It was filled with

35:24.471 --> 35:27.075
sadness, desperation.

35:27.108 --> 35:29.543
A mother who would do anything

35:29.576 --> 35:31.445
for her child.

35:31.478 --> 35:33.647
Well, maybe she smacked you
a little harder than you think.

35:34.615 --> 35:37.451
Okay, let's just keep this
between us for right now?

35:39.721 --> 35:42.456
Besides she missed her last
two sessions anyway.

35:42.489 --> 35:43.758
I don't like this, Lil.

35:44.793 --> 35:46.928
I'll tell Will when I'm ready.

35:47.796 --> 35:48.930
I just don't want him to...

35:48.963 --> 35:50.364
Overreact, too?

35:51.065 --> 35:52.000
Yes.

35:53.802 --> 35:56.570
I met Emily at the
park when I was a kid.

35:57.371 --> 35:59.707
She rescued me
from a group of bullies.

36:01.475 --> 36:04.444
I had never met someone so tough

36:04.478 --> 36:06.480
and kind at the same time.

36:07.882 --> 36:10.484
That day she told me

36:10.517 --> 36:12.086
she'd never let anyone
hurt me again.

36:12.120 --> 36:14.588
You always say that
but you're incredibly smart.

36:15.622 --> 36:16.958
That's very nice of you.

36:16.991 --> 36:18.993
No, no, there's no way.

36:22.964 --> 36:25.900
Hey, you guys need a ride?

36:25.934 --> 36:27.869
I don't get into cars
with strangers.

36:27.902 --> 36:29.103
Besides my aunt's on her way.

36:29.137 --> 36:30.004
Cool.

36:30.038 --> 36:30.905
Does she need a ride, too?

36:33.007 --> 36:34.876
She's gonna read
through your intentions.

36:34.909 --> 36:35.977
Intentions?

36:36.010 --> 36:36.978
You know what I mean.

36:37.011 --> 36:37.979
No intentions here.

36:38.012 --> 36:38.847
Your aunt can come along,

36:38.880 --> 36:40.647
we're just doing a group thing
later.

36:40.682 --> 36:42.083
What kind of group thing?

36:42.116 --> 36:43.650
Oh, you know, the usual:

36:43.685 --> 36:46.386
smoke weed, get drunk,
vandalize some property.

36:46.420 --> 36:47.155
Everything
your aunt's gonna love.

36:49.623 --> 36:52.392
Yeah, and canoeing.

36:56.164 --> 36:58.933
You guys look really awkward,
I got to say.

36:58.967 --> 37:00.567
Thanks.

37:04.873 --> 37:06.074
You guys are pretty slow.

37:06.107 --> 37:06.908
Better than you.

37:06.941 --> 37:08.076
Hey, you're doing great.

37:08.109 --> 37:09.043
Thanks, I know.

37:18.887 --> 37:20.855
This thing is
super uncomfortable.

37:25.592 --> 37:27.161
Living dangerously.

37:27.195 --> 37:28.162
Okay.

37:28.930 --> 37:32.033
So when you're not picking
up trash

37:32.066 --> 37:34.635
with strangers,
what do you like to do?

37:34.669 --> 37:37.437
Watch movies, well,
more like listen, I guess.

37:38.572 --> 37:41.475
Alright uh, what's your favorite
<i>Star Wars</i> movie?

37:41.508 --> 37:43.211
Wizard of Oz.

37:43.244 --> 37:44.779
It has nothing to do
with <i>Star Wars.</i>

37:46.781 --> 37:48.983
My mother and I
used to watch it together.

37:50.885 --> 37:53.688
Yeah, this lake really
gives me the creeps.

37:54.621 --> 37:55.924
Why?

37:55.957 --> 37:57.591
I just hear a ton of people
drown in it.

37:57.624 --> 37:59.661
That's why I never come here.

37:59.694 --> 38:01.461
What if I pushed you in.

38:02.596 --> 38:04.165
What if I slapped
the shit out of you.

38:06.200 --> 38:07.735
Can I ask you a question?

38:07.769 --> 38:09.003
Sure.

38:09.304 --> 38:10.838
What's with your headphones?

38:10.872 --> 38:12.040
You wear 'em all the time,

38:12.073 --> 38:13.440
but I've never actually seen
you use 'em.

38:14.508 --> 38:16.476
How long have you been
watching me?

38:16.510 --> 38:17.679
A while.

38:17.712 --> 38:18.445
Stalker.

38:19.613 --> 38:21.983
I prefer admiring from afar,

38:22.016 --> 38:23.017
it's much less creepy.

38:29.623 --> 38:31.159
Oh shit,
guys watch out!

38:32.694 --> 38:33.227
Lilly!

38:33.261 --> 38:34.195
Lilly!

39:03.091 --> 39:04.192
Lilly.

39:18.306 --> 39:20.074
- Oh my God, Jesus, Lil.
- Lil.

39:22.609 --> 39:23.543
You okay?

39:27.148 --> 39:28.049
Are you okay?

39:34.355 --> 39:36.124
EVA, news brief.

39:37.792 --> 39:39.794
<i>Mobile PD are
investigating the death</i>

39:39.827 --> 39:42.629
<i>of an 8-year-old boy downtown
after he was hit</i>

39:42.663 --> 39:43.865
<i>by a city bus.</i>

39:43.898 --> 39:46.067
<i>Investigation is still on going.</i>

39:46.934 --> 39:49.771
<i>City officials say the bus line
will stay open as usual.</i>

39:51.839 --> 39:53.174
Mr. Wiggy.

39:53.207 --> 39:54.909
Mr. Wiggy.

39:55.143 --> 39:56.677
Mr. Wiggy.

39:56.711 --> 39:57.879
Mr. Wiggy.

39:58.746 --> 40:00.081
Where are you, Mr. Wiggy?

40:00.114 --> 40:01.648
Madison, right?

40:01.682 --> 40:03.617
Yeah,
how did you remember?

40:03.650 --> 40:05.686
Oh, let's just say
I'm pretty good

40:05.720 --> 40:06.888
at recognizing voices.

40:08.156 --> 40:10.224
Oh, that's right, you're blind.

40:12.226 --> 40:13.995
That was really rude.

40:14.028 --> 40:15.830
I shouldn't have said that.

40:15.863 --> 40:17.098
I'm sorry.

40:17.131 --> 40:18.598
It's okay.

40:18.632 --> 40:20.600
Did Mr. Wiggy not come back
for his treat?

40:20.634 --> 40:22.837
No, I think a stupid squirrel
ate it

40:22.870 --> 40:24.972
before Mr. Wiggy
could get to it.

40:25.006 --> 40:26.640
Oh, I'm sorry.

40:28.709 --> 40:31.578
I should probably
get going anyways.

40:32.313 --> 40:34.882
Oh, it's a beautiful day today,
isn't it?

40:34.916 --> 40:35.783
Yeah.

40:39.787 --> 40:41.055
Surprised there are no flowers.

40:41.722 --> 40:43.623
Now this is your stop,
right?

40:45.426 --> 40:47.228
Yeah, how did you know that?

40:47.261 --> 40:48.696
Like being...

40:49.797 --> 40:51.699
Do you like have
superpowers or something?

40:53.600 --> 40:55.837
No, I don't have superpowers.

40:56.571 --> 40:57.972
Being blind actually gives me

40:58.005 --> 40:59.606
a pretty good sense
of direction.

40:59.941 --> 41:01.075
It does?

41:02.977 --> 41:05.847
See every step I take
is another small detail

41:05.880 --> 41:08.015
added to the image in my mind
of the world around me.

41:08.816 --> 41:11.185
To others, my world
may seem dark,

41:11.219 --> 41:14.021
but it's actually really bright,
beautiful.

41:15.223 --> 41:17.291
What do you see around you now?

41:17.325 --> 41:19.393
Ooh,

41:19.427 --> 41:22.263
I see a sidewalk
made of yellow bricks.

41:23.798 --> 41:26.633
Trees, grass, green as could be,

41:27.401 --> 41:29.937
surrounded by bright red
flowers.

41:29.971 --> 41:32.406
And standing in front of me

41:32.440 --> 41:35.276
is a beautiful young lady
wearing little red shoes.

41:35.910 --> 41:38.279
Your world sounds amazing.

41:38.312 --> 41:40.748
Mine isn't as awesome as yours.

41:40.781 --> 41:42.917
It's your world,
you make it whatever you want.

41:43.784 --> 41:45.119
My shoes aren't red.

41:45.153 --> 41:46.320
They're old and ugly.

41:46.354 --> 41:48.289
I think the bottom has a hole.

41:48.322 --> 41:50.892
Sometimes I can feel a rock
in my shoe.

41:51.993 --> 41:53.895
It just means you been
on a long journey in life.

41:53.928 --> 41:56.464
Does that mean
you've been on a short one?

41:56.497 --> 41:57.765
What do you mean?

41:57.798 --> 42:00.701
Your shoes are so new
and pretty.

42:00.735 --> 42:02.870
Oh, they were a gift.

42:04.772 --> 42:06.440
Do you want to know a secret?

42:06.674 --> 42:08.709
What secret?

42:08.743 --> 42:10.411
Just because something
is new doesn't make it great.

42:10.878 --> 42:12.880
I miss my old ones.

42:12.914 --> 42:13.881
They fit better.

42:14.382 --> 42:16.250
Mine hurt my feet.

42:16.284 --> 42:17.952
Maybe they're too small.

42:17.985 --> 42:19.287
What size are they?

42:19.887 --> 42:21.389
Two.

42:21.422 --> 42:23.391
Tell your mom next
time you want a size three.

42:23.424 --> 42:25.059
Yes, ma'am.

42:25.626 --> 42:27.295
I should get going,
but I'll keep an ear out

42:27.328 --> 42:28.129
for Mr. Wiggy.

42:28.162 --> 42:28.996
Okay.

42:29.030 --> 42:30.231
Thank you, Ms. Lilly.

42:30.264 --> 42:31.966
Bye for now, Madison.

42:38.239 --> 42:40.441
<i>Wednesday the woman approached
a group of un attended children</i>

42:40.474 --> 42:42.143
<i>in the Cathedral Square
and walked off</i>

42:42.176 --> 42:43.778
<i>with a 5-year-old girl.</i>

42:44.178 --> 42:46.013
<i>Police are asking anyone
with tips or leads</i>

42:46.047 --> 42:48.149
<i>to call 911 immediately.</i>

42:48.182 --> 42:50.084
That's the fourth child
this month.

42:51.052 --> 42:53.154
I mean who would want
to take innocent children?

42:54.088 --> 42:55.723
Sick people.

42:56.457 --> 42:57.892
Here, let me help you with that.

42:57.925 --> 42:59.327
I got it!

43:02.496 --> 43:05.032
We use to do this together
all the time.

43:05.933 --> 43:07.969
I just want to finish something
on my own for once.

43:11.973 --> 43:14.175
I couldn't but feel selfish

43:14.208 --> 43:16.978
for thinking about myself while
Aunt Becca was suffering.

43:19.013 --> 43:21.148
I knew she always thought
about me.

43:22.550 --> 43:24.952
But I wish she had someone
to watch out for her.

43:26.120 --> 43:27.421
Everybody got a license?

43:27.455 --> 43:28.155
Yup.

43:28.189 --> 43:29.523
Right here, sir.

43:29.557 --> 43:31.359
I really hate my photo.

43:31.392 --> 43:33.427
The DMV's cameras are outdated.

43:33.461 --> 43:34.795
So?

43:34.829 --> 43:36.330
You look good.

43:36.364 --> 43:38.266
The cameras just take
bad photos.

43:39.200 --> 43:41.235
Are you hitting on me?

43:43.938 --> 43:45.473
What about you?

43:45.506 --> 43:46.474
I don't have a license.

43:46.507 --> 43:48.209
I can't legally drive.

43:48.242 --> 43:49.277
I just meant an ID.

43:51.946 --> 43:52.880
Are you okay?

43:53.281 --> 43:54.882
Yeah.

43:54.915 --> 43:56.017
I'm just tired of everyone
treating me different.

43:56.951 --> 43:58.319
You are different.

43:58.352 --> 43:59.987
Dude, shut up.

44:00.288 --> 44:01.555
Why do you feel that way?

44:03.190 --> 44:05.926
All you guys have your licenses
and I'm just useless.

44:05.960 --> 44:08.429
Lil, there's a shit load
of people

44:08.462 --> 44:11.299
who can see clear as day
that don't have licenses.

44:11.332 --> 44:13.367
And there's a shit load of 'em
who do,

44:13.401 --> 44:14.502
that can't drive too.

44:14.535 --> 44:16.070
Yeah.

44:16.470 --> 44:19.073
You know what, just because
you can't legally drive,

44:19.106 --> 44:20.508
doesn't mean
you shouldn't learn how to.

44:22.977 --> 44:24.245
Wait, what?

44:27.615 --> 44:28.949
Remember what I told you?

44:28.983 --> 44:29.984
Yeah.

44:30.017 --> 44:31.452
Right gas, left break.

44:31.485 --> 44:32.219
Yeah.

44:32.253 --> 44:34.555
I can't believe
we're doing this.

44:35.623 --> 44:36.524
Are you ready?

44:36.557 --> 44:37.458
Yeah.

45:09.590 --> 45:11.625
Have you lost your goddamn mind?

45:11.660 --> 45:13.494
She could have been
seriously hurt!

45:13.527 --> 45:14.628
I'm sorry.

45:14.663 --> 45:15.664
I just didn't want her
to feel left out.

45:15.697 --> 45:17.131
Aunt Becca, it's okay.

45:17.164 --> 45:17.998
I'm fine.

45:18.032 --> 45:19.600
I made them do it.

45:19.633 --> 45:22.036
I just wanted to go
to a concert.

45:22.069 --> 45:24.271
I expected more common sense
from all of you.

45:25.272 --> 45:27.141
We're really sorry.

45:28.376 --> 45:29.477
Let's go.

45:35.282 --> 45:36.550
I just want to fit in.

45:36.584 --> 45:38.185
Lilly, you're different.

45:38.219 --> 45:39.220
I don't wanna be.

45:44.425 --> 45:46.460
And that's what makes you
one of a kind.

45:54.402 --> 45:55.336
Adapt.

45:58.673 --> 46:00.174
I'm really sorry.

46:01.075 --> 46:02.276
It was stupid.

46:03.644 --> 46:06.313
Yeah,
I just love you, kiddo.

46:07.749 --> 46:08.949
Come here.

46:08.983 --> 46:10.151
I love you.

46:12.520 --> 46:14.488
Don't ever do that again.

46:42.483 --> 46:44.485
Hi there, can I help you?

46:44.518 --> 46:46.220
Um, is Madison home?

46:48.757 --> 46:51.559
Um, there is no one
by that name here.

46:52.326 --> 46:54.995
Oh no,
she told me she lives here.

46:55.029 --> 46:56.230
I walked her home a few times.

46:56.263 --> 46:59.033
You know, that's really odd
because it's uh,

46:59.066 --> 47:01.502
it's just me and my wife
and we don't have any kids.

47:02.069 --> 47:05.039
I tell you what,
why don't you come inside?

47:05.072 --> 47:07.441
And we'll see if we can
sort through this confusion?

47:07.676 --> 47:09.477
Oh, you know that's alright.

47:10.311 --> 47:12.781
I am sure that
I am just mistaking hers

47:12.814 --> 47:14.248
for another home.

47:15.316 --> 47:17.251
We've met, right?

47:17.284 --> 47:17.919
Lillian?

47:17.953 --> 47:19.320
Lillian from the book store.

47:19.353 --> 47:20.254
It's Jerry.

47:23.057 --> 47:25.192
Were you able to find Matilda?

47:25.694 --> 47:26.494
Yeah.

47:26.527 --> 47:27.428
Yeah, I did.

47:29.396 --> 47:31.700
Why a children's book
if you don't have any kids?

47:31.733 --> 47:33.601
Oh well, my niece.

47:36.303 --> 47:37.806
Have a good day.

47:59.360 --> 48:00.327
Who was that?

48:03.397 --> 48:05.099
We need to talk.

48:54.582 --> 48:57.518
So where do you plan on taking
my Lilly tonight?

48:57.551 --> 48:59.286
Nowhere in particular.

48:59.320 --> 49:01.488
Hmm, seems
"nowhere in particular"

49:01.522 --> 49:04.224
isn't a very good place to go
without a plan.

49:04.258 --> 49:05.794
I have a plan.

49:07.662 --> 49:10.164
She gets behind the wheel again,

49:10.197 --> 49:11.532
I have a plan for you, too.

49:12.600 --> 49:13.735
No, ma'am.

49:13.768 --> 49:15.804
Not ever, ever.

49:18.572 --> 49:21.308
Good, have fun you guys.

49:23.678 --> 49:25.312
Uh, be safe.

49:25.346 --> 49:27.581
- Love you.
- Love you.

49:27.615 --> 49:28.917
Don't wait up.

49:28.950 --> 49:31.151
I plan to.

49:33.655 --> 49:36.290
It was hard to tell
if this guy was for real

49:36.323 --> 49:38.626
or if he was a creep.

49:38.660 --> 49:41.562
I think not being able to see
his face told me more

49:41.595 --> 49:44.264
about his heart
than vision ever could.

49:44.298 --> 49:46.467
So where are we going?

49:46.500 --> 49:47.501
Somewhere special.

50:02.483 --> 50:05.386
So uh, we're here.

50:05.820 --> 50:07.454
Where's here?

50:08.389 --> 50:09.858
A place where you make wishes.

50:09.891 --> 50:12.292
Sounds like a fountain.

50:12.326 --> 50:15.429
Yeah,

50:15.462 --> 50:18.232
uh Lilly, you have something
on your face.

50:18.265 --> 50:19.600
Do I?

50:19.633 --> 50:21.402
- Yeah, it's...
- Where?

50:21.435 --> 50:23.637
It's right here.

50:38.285 --> 50:39.453
Aren't you going to throw
a quarter in

50:39.486 --> 50:40.822
and make a wish?

50:41.255 --> 50:43.792
I uh, already got mine.

51:09.416 --> 51:10.819
Aunt Becca, we're back.

51:13.955 --> 51:14.856
Aunt Becca!

51:15.790 --> 51:17.025
Maybe she went to bed.

51:17.058 --> 51:18.559
You kidding?

51:18.592 --> 51:20.695
She won't close her eyes
until she gets a full report.

51:22.831 --> 51:23.765
Aunt Becca.

51:24.631 --> 51:26.533
- Lilly!
- What?

51:26.567 --> 51:27.401
Oh shit.

51:27.434 --> 51:27.902
What?

51:30.872 --> 51:31.538
I gotta call 911.

51:31.572 --> 51:32.841
Aunt Becca!

51:32.874 --> 51:33.775
Aunt Becca!

51:38.645 --> 51:39.748
Aunt Becca!

51:43.617 --> 51:45.385
Aunt Becca!

51:53.995 --> 51:56.831
Oh wow, they really outdid

51:56.865 --> 51:58.066
themselves this time.

51:58.099 --> 51:59.868
They should have,
you deserve it.

52:01.736 --> 52:02.636
Are you okay?

52:03.604 --> 52:04.605
Oh, yeah.

52:04.638 --> 52:06.340
There's my boy!

52:06.373 --> 52:08.042
Ha-ha, here I am.

52:08.542 --> 52:11.378
I'm sorry, Will,
but he's already a few deep.

52:11.411 --> 52:12.080
Already celebrating?

52:12.113 --> 52:13.681
Ooh, yeah.

52:15.382 --> 52:17.351
Why don't I take Miss Lilly
and you two go impress

52:17.384 --> 52:18.920
or whatever it is that you...
that you do.

52:22.389 --> 52:23.557
You see all this?

52:23.590 --> 52:24.926
Yes, I do.

52:25.226 --> 52:26.961
Well, you paid for it.

52:26.995 --> 52:28.428
Thank you for the reminder.

52:28.462 --> 52:30.031
It's coming out
of your paycheck!

52:32.000 --> 52:32.667
Uh, this one?

52:32.700 --> 52:33.433
Mhmm.

52:43.510 --> 52:44.913
Right now.

52:52.887 --> 52:55.824
Oh, oh, thank you.

52:55.857 --> 52:57.591
- He just gave her a flower.
- I need a drink.

52:57.624 --> 52:59.127
Oh, what a gentleman.

52:59.160 --> 53:00.094
Mhmm.

53:02.030 --> 53:04.799
When I first started
Akear, working around the clock,

53:05.632 --> 53:08.468
design after design,
rejection after rejection,

53:09.737 --> 53:11.471
we never gave up.

53:12.406 --> 53:14.042
And it's that drive
that brought this company

53:14.075 --> 53:15.442
to where it is today.

53:17.045 --> 53:19.013
So we can never let the man
who's responsible...

53:19.047 --> 53:20.447
Excuse me.

53:20.480 --> 53:21.515
Yes?

53:21.548 --> 53:23.383
I was just wondering,

53:23.417 --> 53:25.619
do you want a boy or a girl?

53:27.155 --> 53:30.024
I'm sorry,
I don't know what you mean.

53:30.058 --> 53:32.060
Oh, of course you do.

53:32.927 --> 53:34.929
Will you choose the baby?

53:34.963 --> 53:36.396
What are you doing?

53:36.430 --> 53:37.832
You look like a crazy person.

53:37.866 --> 53:39.067
Oh, I was just talking to the...

53:39.100 --> 53:40.702
There's nobody there, Lil.

53:40.735 --> 53:42.603
Oh, I heard a...

53:44.504 --> 53:46.140
Who did you hear?

53:46.174 --> 53:48.743
Some of you never met the man
who is responsible for tonight,

53:48.776 --> 53:49.911
Mr. William Arden.

53:56.483 --> 53:57.785
And I see that same drive
in him.

53:59.586 --> 54:00.655
Come and say few words, William.

54:22.677 --> 54:25.512
This project wouldn't be
where it is today

54:27.048 --> 54:28.816
without the love and inspiration

54:28.850 --> 54:30.685
of my wife, Lilly.

54:32.253 --> 54:35.089
She's taught me to see

54:35.657 --> 54:38.693
the worlds that coexist
amongst people

54:38.726 --> 54:40.728
with and without disabilities.

54:40.762 --> 54:42.764
And I owe you everything.

54:44.132 --> 54:45.166
And Akear will be developing

54:45.199 --> 54:47.101
these new
state-of-the-art buildings

54:47.135 --> 54:49.904
as a main priority for users
with disabilities.

55:15.263 --> 55:16.230
How are you feeling?

55:17.665 --> 55:20.534
Good, just a little exhausted.

55:23.972 --> 55:25.873
The old lady.

55:25.907 --> 55:27.675
It's just my imagination.

56:11.686 --> 56:14.322
You know,

56:14.355 --> 56:17.125
you know that if you ever wanted
to talk about anything,

56:17.959 --> 56:18.926
that I'm here.

56:30.171 --> 56:31.806
I love you.

56:33.307 --> 56:35.642
I love you, too.

58:17.979 --> 58:19.213
- Hey, it's just a dream.
- No.

58:19.247 --> 58:20.181
It's just a dream.

58:20.214 --> 58:21.249
It's just a dream.

58:22.183 --> 58:23.184
It's real.

58:24.852 --> 58:27.054
Hey, it's just a dream,
you're fine.

58:29.056 --> 58:30.224
Everything checks out.

58:30.258 --> 58:32.093
You are as healthy as can be.

58:32.827 --> 58:35.196
The ultrasound hasn't shown
a heartbeat yet.

58:36.964 --> 58:38.399
Is that normal?

58:39.367 --> 58:41.002
Very.

58:41.035 --> 58:42.737
But next time you come in,
it'll be thumping away.

58:43.304 --> 58:44.839
I'm sorry?

58:44.872 --> 58:46.240
The heartbeat.

58:46.274 --> 58:47.975
Your next visit,
I'm almost certain

58:48.009 --> 58:49.343
we'll find a heartbeat.

58:50.945 --> 58:52.780
Thank you doctor.

58:52.813 --> 58:54.682
I'll go ahead
and set up the next appointment.

58:57.084 --> 58:57.818
That'd be great.

58:57.852 --> 58:58.953
Thank you very much.

59:08.162 --> 59:10.831
I hadn't felt so helpless

59:10.865 --> 59:13.000
since the accident.

59:13.034 --> 59:15.903
The idea of losing my aunt

59:17.138 --> 59:18.706
was more than I could bear.

59:19.373 --> 59:20.875
Hey, Aunt Becca.

59:24.078 --> 59:25.012
Lilly!

59:26.847 --> 59:28.015
Hey, kiddo.

59:28.482 --> 59:30.952
Yeah, it's me,
how are you feeling today?

59:33.254 --> 59:34.855
I'm feeling great.

59:36.257 --> 59:39.093
Oh, I wanted to tell you
something.

59:39.894 --> 59:40.728
What's that?

59:42.797 --> 59:44.398
I had a dream about you.

59:45.299 --> 59:46.267
Tell me about your dream.

59:49.303 --> 59:50.404
My dream?

59:54.008 --> 59:55.376
Lilly, do you dream?

59:56.544 --> 59:58.045
Sometimes.

59:58.079 --> 59:59.480
What was yours about?

01:00:05.486 --> 01:00:08.322
I dreamt that they were coming
to take you away from me.

01:00:15.363 --> 01:00:16.230
You remember
when they said

01:00:16.264 --> 01:00:19.033
I wasn't fit to take care
of you anymore.

01:00:20.501 --> 01:00:22.236
I'm not going anywhere.

01:00:22.937 --> 01:00:25.306
They didn't take me then,
and they won't now.

01:00:38.152 --> 01:00:40.187
I'm sorry
I ruined your life.

01:00:43.357 --> 01:00:45.293
I was supposed
to watch over you

01:00:46.894 --> 01:00:48.329
and now you're taking care
of me.

01:00:49.563 --> 01:00:51.299
Don't apologize.

01:00:52.199 --> 01:00:53.868
You taught me to be strong.

01:00:55.202 --> 01:00:57.238
We're family
and we always will be.

01:01:01.442 --> 01:01:03.110
I tried, Lilly.

01:01:05.479 --> 01:01:08.182
I really tried to hold it
together as long as I could.

01:01:09.250 --> 01:01:10.885
And you did.

01:01:12.086 --> 01:01:13.554
We'll get through this.

01:01:28.135 --> 01:01:29.203
Adapt?

01:01:29.236 --> 01:01:30.504
Adapt.

01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:40.548
So,
how many of you guys are giving birth

01:01:40.581 --> 01:01:41.982
for the first time?

01:01:44.652 --> 01:01:46.554
I like to kind
of crowd check the room,

01:01:46.587 --> 01:01:48.122
because we have
a lot of husbands

01:01:48.155 --> 01:01:49.924
who will raise their hands.

01:01:49.957 --> 01:01:52.193
Um, being a new parent,
giving birth for the first time,

01:01:52.226 --> 01:01:54.161
it requires lots of new skills,
lots of things

01:01:54.195 --> 01:01:56.997
that you didn't think you would
ever have to tap in to.

01:01:57.598 --> 01:01:59.500
So Mr. Miracle of giving birth.

01:01:59.533 --> 01:02:01.202
What do you think
one of those skills is?

01:02:05.206 --> 01:02:06.407
Uh, to make another baby?

01:02:09.043 --> 01:02:10.511
Damn,
that's absolutely not the answer.

01:02:10.544 --> 01:02:12.646
The answer is gonna be
team work.

01:02:12.681 --> 01:02:15.516
You guys have to come together,
because at the end of the day,

01:02:15.549 --> 01:02:17.251
you're gonna have
outside pressures,

01:02:17.284 --> 01:02:18.953
you're gonna have
inside pressures,

01:02:18.986 --> 01:02:21.555
sleep deprivation, changings,
feedings, then you got...

01:02:23.557 --> 01:02:26.327
Oh, uh shit,
I totally forgot the gift bag.

01:02:27.228 --> 01:02:28.596
Just wait here, okay,
I'm gonna leave the keys.

01:02:28.629 --> 01:02:30.064
I'm gonna run in and get it.

01:02:54.121 --> 01:02:55.423
Take my baby.

01:02:58.025 --> 01:02:59.293
Take my baby.

01:03:00.762 --> 01:03:03.063
Please take my baby.

01:03:07.669 --> 01:03:09.236
Please take my baby.

01:03:13.007 --> 01:03:14.608
Please take my baby.

01:03:17.779 --> 01:03:19.413
Please take my baby.

01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:27.455
Please take my baby.

01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:33.327
Please take my baby.

01:03:33.895 --> 01:03:36.397
Wow, that lady can talk up
a storm.

01:03:38.466 --> 01:03:39.400
Lilly.

01:03:39.433 --> 01:03:40.334
What are you...
wait.

01:03:40.836 --> 01:03:42.436
What do you want?

01:03:43.237 --> 01:03:44.505
What do you want?

01:03:44.538 --> 01:03:47.107
- Lilly, what are you doing?
- Leave me alone!

01:03:47.141 --> 01:03:47.776
Stop following me.

01:03:47.809 --> 01:03:49.210
Lil, what are you doing?

01:03:49.243 --> 01:03:50.444
- What do you want?
- Wait, I'm right here.

01:03:50.478 --> 01:03:51.713
- Lilly.
- I heard someone.

01:03:51.746 --> 01:03:53.347
No one,
there's no one here.

01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:55.684
- No, I heard someone.
- It's just us, it's just us.

01:03:59.119 --> 01:04:00.020
It's empty.

01:04:00.054 --> 01:04:00.988
It's just us.

01:04:03.057 --> 01:04:04.659
Can we get back in the car?

01:04:05.292 --> 01:04:06.227
Yeah.

01:04:07.729 --> 01:04:09.296
Get back in the car.

01:04:09.698 --> 01:04:10.631
Okay.

01:04:13.267 --> 01:04:14.468
Right here.

01:04:30.484 --> 01:04:33.153
I couldn't explain it,

01:04:33.187 --> 01:04:35.824
but something was coming for me.

01:04:56.610 --> 01:04:58.813
Hey, are you sure you're okay?

01:04:59.446 --> 01:05:00.548
I'm fine.

01:05:05.586 --> 01:05:07.254
I remember those.

01:05:08.455 --> 01:05:09.824
Do they still work?

01:05:09.858 --> 01:05:11.358
I don't know.

01:05:13.594 --> 01:05:15.563
Um, the shoes, those are

01:05:15.596 --> 01:05:18.499
a little big for a newborn,
don't you think?

01:05:18.532 --> 01:05:21.502
Uh yeah, they were a gift

01:05:21.535 --> 01:05:23.872
for this little girl, Madison.

01:05:23.905 --> 01:05:25.774
A gift...
who's Madison?

01:05:25.807 --> 01:05:27.508
I had met her on my walks home.

01:05:27.541 --> 01:05:28.743
She lost her cat.

01:05:30.277 --> 01:05:32.479
Wow, that's really thoughtful.

01:05:32.513 --> 01:05:34.181
Well, I'm sure she'll love them.

01:05:34.214 --> 01:05:36.751
She's a sweet kid.
I felt like we met before.

01:05:36.785 --> 01:05:38.152
We just clicked.

01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:40.855
You do have that way with kids.

01:05:42.590 --> 01:05:44.325
I went by her house today.

01:05:45.626 --> 01:05:46.560
And?

01:05:50.164 --> 01:05:52.366
The man
who lives there says

01:05:52.399 --> 01:05:55.135
he's never heard of Madison.

01:05:57.571 --> 01:05:59.273
Are you sure
it was the right house?

01:05:59.306 --> 01:06:00.608
It's my usual path.

01:06:00.641 --> 01:06:03.410
And we stop at the exact spot
every time,

01:06:03.444 --> 01:06:04.713
I'm sure.

01:06:04.746 --> 01:06:05.847
So in midtown?

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:06.815
Yeah.

01:06:08.449 --> 01:06:09.718
Hmm, I don't know.

01:06:11.185 --> 01:06:13.621
Something doesn't feel right
about Jerry.

01:06:14.521 --> 01:06:15.489
The guy at the house?

01:06:15.522 --> 01:06:16.457
Yeah.

01:06:18.192 --> 01:06:19.159
Well, I don't know,

01:06:19.193 --> 01:06:21.730
I'm sure he was just
as surprised as you were.

01:06:21.763 --> 01:06:23.798
I mean kids tell stories
all the time.

01:06:23.832 --> 01:06:24.833
You know that.

01:06:25.867 --> 01:06:27.869
She had no reason to lie to me.

01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:31.873
Maybe next time

01:06:31.906 --> 01:06:33.742
ask her to invite you
to meet her parents?

01:06:35.877 --> 01:06:37.879
I can tell that
he's lying to me.

01:06:40.648 --> 01:06:42.817
Are we still talking
about Jerry?

01:06:42.851 --> 01:06:43.785
Yeah.

01:06:46.620 --> 01:06:49.423
Lil, you've been acting

01:06:49.456 --> 01:06:51.325
really strange lately.

01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:55.764
I know you're going through
a lot of stress

01:06:55.797 --> 01:06:56.765
with the baby.

01:06:56.798 --> 01:06:59.768
And I don't know,
maybe

01:06:59.801 --> 01:07:01.468
it'd be a good idea to take
a break,

01:07:01.502 --> 01:07:03.437
and talk to someone
for a little bit.

01:07:06.507 --> 01:07:07.709
About what?

01:07:09.844 --> 01:07:12.479
Just some of the things
that you are hearing.

01:07:16.417 --> 01:07:18.352
I'll be my own shrink,
Will.

01:07:18.385 --> 01:07:19.486
I didn't mean it like that,
Lilly.

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:20.454
Mhmm.

01:07:29.396 --> 01:07:31.465
Whatever was happening

01:07:31.498 --> 01:07:32.934
was getting worse.

01:07:32.967 --> 01:07:35.670
I wouldn't wish this on anyone.

01:07:35.704 --> 01:07:36.905
I just don't wanna go.

01:07:36.938 --> 01:07:38.472
It's a once in a life time
thing.

01:07:38.505 --> 01:07:39.606
This dance is stupid.

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:40.809
It's like a celebration.

01:07:40.842 --> 01:07:43.577
There's nothing in my life
I want to celebrate right now!

01:07:43.610 --> 01:07:45.245
I just want to be home
with my aunt.

01:07:45.279 --> 01:07:46.915
You cannot plan your life
around her.

01:07:46.948 --> 01:07:49.583
I don't wanna go home one day
and find her like we did.

01:07:49.616 --> 01:07:50.685
And that is something

01:07:50.719 --> 01:07:52.020
you will always
have to be prepared for.

01:07:52.053 --> 01:07:53.287
You're a dick.

01:07:53.755 --> 01:07:54.756
What are you doing?

01:07:56.523 --> 01:07:57.458
Lilly.

01:08:01.361 --> 01:08:02.296
Ugh.

01:08:11.072 --> 01:08:12.674
Hey, where are you headed?

01:08:17.946 --> 01:08:19.479
Shit!

01:08:19.513 --> 01:08:20.413
Shit, Will.

01:08:21.448 --> 01:08:22.884
What are you thinking?

01:08:29.991 --> 01:08:31.826
Hey, I'm heading that way.

01:08:31.859 --> 01:08:33.327
Wouldn't be a problem.

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:34.328
Thank you.

01:08:35.629 --> 01:08:37.765
Don't get in, he'll hurt you.

01:08:37.799 --> 01:08:38.767
I'm sorry?

01:08:39.834 --> 01:08:41.401
He's a bad man.

01:08:43.569 --> 01:08:44.571
Are you getting in?

01:08:45.404 --> 01:08:46.340
I.

01:08:47.942 --> 01:08:48.877
Hey!

01:08:50.344 --> 01:08:51.278
Hey!

01:09:03.124 --> 01:09:05.591
Hey, I was a dick.

01:09:07.028 --> 01:09:08.830
Hey, I was a bitch.

01:09:17.705 --> 01:09:18.973
So what do we now?

01:09:20.439 --> 01:09:22.576
Can we just sit here
for a moment?

01:09:24.511 --> 01:09:25.078
Sure.

01:09:28.116 --> 01:09:29.984
<i>This
world, you can hear them.</i>

01:09:31.786 --> 01:09:34.555
David can move on with his life,
we could be a family again.

01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:37.591
<i>Diana you
are not making any sense.</i>

01:09:38.591 --> 01:09:40.359
<i>Lilly, you're special.</i>

01:09:41.129 --> 01:09:43.031
<i>You can give them
a second chance.</i>

01:09:45.066 --> 01:09:46.667
<i>I can't believe it's you.</i>

01:09:51.139 --> 01:09:52.674
Who is it?

01:09:52.707 --> 01:09:54.108
It's Diana.

01:10:02.784 --> 01:10:03.685
I won't touch you.

01:10:03.718 --> 01:10:04.886
I promise.

01:10:04.919 --> 01:10:06.587
It's alright, Diana.

01:10:07.021 --> 01:10:07.922
Where have you been?

01:10:09.891 --> 01:10:12.392
I was just so embarrassed
about my actions

01:10:12.426 --> 01:10:14.829
and uh, let's just say

01:10:14.863 --> 01:10:17.765
I've been doing
some soul searching.

01:10:17.799 --> 01:10:19.067
Would you like to come in?

01:10:20.068 --> 01:10:20.902
Yes.

01:10:27.876 --> 01:10:29.610
You don't have to be ashamed.

01:10:31.145 --> 01:10:32.981
You could still hear them,
can't you?

01:10:35.482 --> 01:10:37.118
You don't have much time really.

01:10:38.753 --> 01:10:40.587
What do you mean?

01:10:40.621 --> 01:10:42.522
They've all asked to be
your baby, haven't they?

01:10:43.224 --> 01:10:44.158
Yes.

01:10:46.794 --> 01:10:48.562
May I see your hands?

01:10:55.469 --> 01:10:57.138
You can feel them, can't you?

01:10:59.841 --> 01:11:02.509
You and your baby are special.

01:11:02.542 --> 01:11:05.013
A lifeline
that wasn't meant to exist.

01:11:06.881 --> 01:11:09.751
Because of that, your baby
is the second chance

01:11:09.784 --> 01:11:11.886
for all the ones
that are trapped.

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:12.921
Trapped?

01:11:14.989 --> 01:11:17.025
It's something like limbo.

01:11:19.559 --> 01:11:21.062
This is hard to believe.

01:11:23.865 --> 01:11:26.600
Until its first heartbeat,
you have the power to choose

01:11:28.102 --> 01:11:30.939
the spirit that will be reborn
in your baby.

01:11:31.706 --> 01:11:33.640
What happens
if I don't choose?

01:11:34.608 --> 01:11:36.144
Then they will choose for you.

01:11:37.812 --> 01:11:39.513
I wanted you to pick David,

01:11:42.016 --> 01:11:43.818
but it wasn't my decision
to make.

01:11:44.786 --> 01:11:46.788
It's yours and yours alone.

01:11:57.999 --> 01:11:59.901
Diana, are you alright?

01:11:59.934 --> 01:12:01.269
Something's coming.

01:12:01.302 --> 01:12:02.536
What?

01:12:02.569 --> 01:12:03.537
I don't know.

01:12:03.570 --> 01:12:05.239
I don't know!

01:12:18.252 --> 01:12:20.722
I don't know if destiny exists.

01:12:20.755 --> 01:12:23.590
But you never know how much
a little thing

01:12:23.623 --> 01:12:26.593
like saying hello to
a little girl

01:12:26.626 --> 01:12:28.863
can change the course
of your life.

01:12:28.896 --> 01:12:31.565
On the left
there are two couples.

01:12:31.598 --> 01:12:34.168
And behind them are two people

01:12:34.202 --> 01:12:35.670
sitting on the bench, too.

01:12:35.703 --> 01:12:37.171
They look really bored.

01:12:38.072 --> 01:12:40.574
I love it when you describe
the world around us.

01:12:42.744 --> 01:12:45.179
So, have you thought about

01:12:45.213 --> 01:12:47.281
what you gonna do next fall?

01:12:47.315 --> 01:12:49.884
Yeah, I've applied to
a few schools nearby.

01:12:49.917 --> 01:12:50.985
What about you?

01:12:51.853 --> 01:12:53.755
Well, I like you.

01:12:54.655 --> 01:12:55.723
A lot.

01:12:56.157 --> 01:12:58.259
So I applied to a few schools
nearby, too.

01:12:58.292 --> 01:12:59.927
Stalker.

01:13:01.162 --> 01:13:03.865
The term boyfriend
is much less creepy.

01:13:05.166 --> 01:13:07.035
Hey, I'm gonna get
some snacks.

01:13:07.068 --> 01:13:08.202
Okay.

01:13:24.252 --> 01:13:26.020
What are you looking at?

01:13:28.189 --> 01:13:30.091
I'm not looking at anything,
actually.

01:13:30.557 --> 01:13:32.260
My name's Madison.

01:13:33.261 --> 01:13:34.295
Nice to meet you,
Madison.

01:13:34.328 --> 01:13:35.663
My name's Lilly.

01:13:38.399 --> 01:13:40.600
So are you enjoying
this beautiful day at the park?

01:13:40.634 --> 01:13:41.601
Yeah!

01:13:42.270 --> 01:13:43.671
Do you come here often?

01:13:44.205 --> 01:13:46.340
I used to
when my mom took me,

01:13:46.374 --> 01:13:49.177
but she got sick,
so now I come with my step-dad.

01:13:51.179 --> 01:13:53.714
He only does it,
'cause my mom asks him to.

01:13:53.748 --> 01:13:54.949
He's really mean.

01:13:56.918 --> 01:13:58.219
Well, I hope your mom
gets better soon,

01:13:58.252 --> 01:14:00.088
so she can bring you here
more often.

01:14:00.822 --> 01:14:01.889
Me too.

01:14:05.326 --> 01:14:05.760
What?

01:14:05.793 --> 01:14:07.161
Replaced already?

01:14:08.963 --> 01:14:10.031
Hey?

01:14:10.064 --> 01:14:11.199
Madison.

01:14:11.232 --> 01:14:12.700
Madison, I'm Will.

01:14:12.733 --> 01:14:13.633
You hungry?

01:14:16.337 --> 01:14:17.972
There you are!

01:14:20.775 --> 01:14:22.743
I see you made some new friends.

01:14:22.777 --> 01:14:24.212
I'm Will, sir.

01:14:24.245 --> 01:14:25.346
It's my girlfriend, Lilly.

01:14:25.379 --> 01:14:26.613
Hi.

01:14:26.981 --> 01:14:27.748
Robert.

01:14:27.782 --> 01:14:30.017
It's such a lovely day.

01:14:31.752 --> 01:14:33.087
Madison!

01:14:33.121 --> 01:14:35.022
You know, you're not supposed
to have that.

01:14:35.056 --> 01:14:36.691
It's not good for you.

01:14:42.063 --> 01:14:43.664
We should get going.

01:14:43.698 --> 01:14:45.299
We still have to find your cat.

01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:49.971
Bye, Lilly.

01:14:50.004 --> 01:14:51.105
Bye.

01:14:56.244 --> 01:14:57.778
That guy was weird.

01:15:00.281 --> 01:15:02.049
Danielle wants to bring food.

01:15:03.851 --> 01:15:05.052
I just don't know about that.

01:15:05.086 --> 01:15:06.721
Somebody needs to tell her
she can't cook.

01:15:11.092 --> 01:15:12.894
Hey, you listening?

01:15:16.831 --> 01:15:19.667
Do you ever think about
how a new life is formed?

01:15:20.601 --> 01:15:22.737
I know how a new life is made
is when you have a little

01:15:22.770 --> 01:15:24.939
too much to drink
and a hell of a night.

01:15:24.972 --> 01:15:26.841
I mean in a spiritual way.

01:15:28.142 --> 01:15:30.111
You know that new life
is formed,

01:15:30.144 --> 01:15:33.080
and it has consciousness,
emotions,

01:15:33.114 --> 01:15:35.716
and a soul of its own.

01:15:37.451 --> 01:15:38.386
Yeah?

01:15:39.987 --> 01:15:41.756
Where does the soul come from?

01:15:42.924 --> 01:15:43.858
Mmm.

01:15:46.194 --> 01:15:48.829
I don't know
where it comes from

01:15:48.863 --> 01:15:51.299
or where it goes.

01:15:51.699 --> 01:15:54.001
I do know that there are two
great days

01:15:54.035 --> 01:15:56.204
in a person's life.

01:15:56.237 --> 01:15:59.006
The day we are born
and the day we discover why.

01:16:01.409 --> 01:16:04.245
Wow, that's really deep, Em.

01:16:07.415 --> 01:16:10.151
Well actually, I read this
off this card you got.

01:16:18.492 --> 01:16:21.762
Lilly,

01:16:21.796 --> 01:16:24.398
I wanted to write to you
before I lost my mind.

01:16:25.399 --> 01:16:27.969
Most people will tell you
I lost it years ago.

01:16:29.537 --> 01:16:31.472
I'm so proud of you.

01:16:33.374 --> 01:16:35.343
God knows you've had
more trouble thrown you're way

01:16:35.376 --> 01:16:37.478
than someone twice your age.

01:16:37.511 --> 01:16:39.447
But you never let it
get you down.

01:16:40.948 --> 01:16:43.451
You're a strong young woman.

01:16:43.484 --> 01:16:45.386
And I know
you'll go far in life.

01:16:47.288 --> 01:16:49.824
Never forget
how much I love you.

01:17:06.607 --> 01:17:08.943
Lilly, what are you doing?

01:17:10.578 --> 01:17:13.547
When the doctors first told her
about the tumor,

01:17:13.581 --> 01:17:16.117
they said she wouldn't make it
past six months.

01:17:17.351 --> 01:17:18.953
She made it a whole year.

01:17:20.221 --> 01:17:22.456
She held on to
who I was

01:17:22.490 --> 01:17:24.892
even when everything
in her life faded.

01:17:25.626 --> 01:17:27.862
She was really an amazing woman.

01:17:51.252 --> 01:17:53.287
Lilly, Lilly.

01:17:55.456 --> 01:17:56.257
Lilly.

01:17:56.624 --> 01:17:59.460
Diana, Diana everything okay?

01:17:59.493 --> 01:18:01.962
Last night in my vision,

01:18:01.996 --> 01:18:04.165
I saw the evil that is coming!

01:18:10.171 --> 01:18:12.239
It eats the souls of children.

01:18:13.541 --> 01:18:16.210
And it used to be human.

01:18:16.243 --> 01:18:18.479
But now, it's something else
entirely different.

01:18:20.414 --> 01:18:22.316
And it has a way to come back.

01:18:22.917 --> 01:18:24.018
Come back?

01:18:26.287 --> 01:18:27.455
Through you.

01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:31.125
Through your baby.

01:18:55.717 --> 01:18:57.318
Who is there?

01:19:05.159 --> 01:19:06.594
I said who is there?

01:19:24.044 --> 01:19:26.981
I said who is there?

01:19:50.404 --> 01:19:51.505
Let me in.

01:19:52.573 --> 01:19:53.641
Let me in!

01:19:53.675 --> 01:19:55.677
EVA, call William.

01:19:55.710 --> 01:19:57.445
I cannot make that call
right now.

01:19:57.478 --> 01:19:59.547
EVA, call William!

01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:01.348
I cannot make that call
right now.

01:20:01.382 --> 01:20:03.551
EVA, call 911!

01:20:03.584 --> 01:20:05.519
There is no one
who can help you.

01:20:05.553 --> 01:20:07.188
I want to be your Baby!

01:20:07.823 --> 01:20:09.590
We want to be your baby!

01:20:09.623 --> 01:20:11.091
We want to be your baby!

01:20:13.494 --> 01:20:15.396
Leave me alone.

01:20:15.429 --> 01:20:16.665
Leave me alone!

01:20:17.465 --> 01:20:19.033
Leave me alone!

01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:21.635
Get away from me!

01:20:22.671 --> 01:20:24.305
Leave us alone!

01:20:25.239 --> 01:20:27.241
Please leave us alone.

01:20:28.342 --> 01:20:29.577
Please, please!

01:20:30.311 --> 01:20:31.312
Leave me alone.

01:20:31.345 --> 01:20:32.379
Leave me alone.

01:20:33.748 --> 01:20:35.316
Leave me alone.

01:20:37.618 --> 01:20:39.553
We want to be your baby!

01:21:15.857 --> 01:21:18.827
Well,

01:21:18.860 --> 01:21:21.796
well?

01:21:22.162 --> 01:21:23.430
I'm gonna ask Emily

01:21:23.464 --> 01:21:25.366
if she can stay with you
for a few days.

01:21:26.735 --> 01:21:28.435
What do you see on the video?

01:21:31.205 --> 01:21:33.140
It was just you, Lilly.

01:21:35.109 --> 01:21:36.343
No.

01:21:37.144 --> 01:21:39.179
No,

01:21:39.213 --> 01:21:42.049
that's not possible.

01:21:42.483 --> 01:21:44.051
I can hear them.

01:21:45.219 --> 01:21:47.388
Will, I can feel them.

01:21:47.421 --> 01:21:48.255
All around me.

01:21:48.289 --> 01:21:50.090
The room was full of them!

01:21:50.124 --> 01:21:51.325
Diana said that they would come.

01:21:51.358 --> 01:21:52.560
Who is Diana?

01:21:52.593 --> 01:21:54.628
They want to be our baby!

01:21:54.663 --> 01:21:55.262
Who?

01:21:55.296 --> 01:21:56.230
Them!

01:21:58.900 --> 01:22:01.703
Lilly, you're not making

01:22:01.736 --> 01:22:04.305
any sense, okay?

01:22:06.607 --> 01:22:09.543
I know you're going through
a lot right now with the baby.

01:22:09.577 --> 01:22:12.446
And I can't imagine
how stressful that must be

01:22:12.479 --> 01:22:14.181
and just being disab...

01:22:17.886 --> 01:22:19.219
Being what, Will?

01:22:22.456 --> 01:22:25.459
There's no one in the video,
but you!

01:22:25.492 --> 01:22:27.461
Lilly, if you could just see it
for yourself!

01:22:27.494 --> 01:22:29.129
Wow, thank you,

01:22:29.163 --> 01:22:31.298
no that's a good one, Will!

01:22:36.270 --> 01:22:37.571
I'm sorry.

01:22:45.346 --> 01:22:46.848
I didn't mean it like that.

01:22:51.518 --> 01:22:53.120
Do you believe me?

01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:57.524
Do you believe me?

01:23:01.195 --> 01:23:02.463
I didn't think so.

01:23:05.566 --> 01:23:07.635
We had gone
years without so much

01:23:07.669 --> 01:23:09.804
as raising our voices
to each other.

01:23:10.170 --> 01:23:12.774
An argument like that, it hurt.

01:23:15.744 --> 01:23:17.478
Is coffee okay?

01:23:17.511 --> 01:23:18.747
Uh, yeah.

01:23:24.385 --> 01:23:25.586
How is she?

01:23:28.422 --> 01:23:29.590
She's upstairs.

01:23:29.623 --> 01:23:30.892
She's still upset.

01:23:32.894 --> 01:23:34.595
And how are you holding up?

01:23:36.497 --> 01:23:38.565
I'm gonna press charges on her.

01:23:38.599 --> 01:23:40.200
That must be Diana.

01:23:41.002 --> 01:23:42.771
How do you know about Diana?

01:23:42.804 --> 01:23:44.873
Lil asked me not to say
anything.

01:23:44.906 --> 01:23:46.473
Never mind.

01:23:55.349 --> 01:23:57.786
Lil believes that something

01:23:57.819 --> 01:24:00.187
or someone is coming
for our baby.

01:24:00.989 --> 01:24:03.424
This crazy woman
is preying on her.

01:24:03.457 --> 01:24:04.425
Yeah.

01:24:09.396 --> 01:24:10.431
Where are you going?

01:24:11.365 --> 01:24:12.734
I need to go talk to Phil.

01:24:15.036 --> 01:24:16.403
Thanks for the coffee.

01:24:16.437 --> 01:24:18.605
Can you just stay,
keep an eye on her

01:24:18.639 --> 01:24:19.373
till I get back?

01:24:19.406 --> 01:24:20.441
Yeah.

01:24:20.909 --> 01:24:22.443
Thank you.

01:24:49.838 --> 01:24:51.338
How are you feeling, Lil?

01:24:54.743 --> 01:24:56.376
Diana was right.

01:24:56.410 --> 01:24:58.579
Look, don't you go thinking
crazy shit, too.

01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:01.281
I have to make a choice.

01:25:01.716 --> 01:25:04.418
She's a con-artist
trying to scam you.

01:25:05.153 --> 01:25:07.789
You have to get all of her
nonsense out of your head.

01:25:07.822 --> 01:25:09.891
I don't want to end up
raising something evil.

01:25:11.059 --> 01:25:13.594
Lil, listen to me.

01:25:14.229 --> 01:25:16.965
Your baby won't be anything
but good.

01:25:17.966 --> 01:25:19.667
You're gonna be a great mom.

01:25:19.701 --> 01:25:21.401
A super-mom.

01:25:22.170 --> 01:25:24.806
And I'm gonna be the best aunt
in the world.

01:25:24.839 --> 01:25:26.708
I'm gonna spoil
that little shit.

01:25:33.514 --> 01:25:34.716
I'm exhausted.

01:25:36.483 --> 01:25:38.285
You should go get some rest.

01:25:40.955 --> 01:25:42.589
Alright, I'll be here.

01:25:46.460 --> 01:25:47.528
I love you.

01:25:47.862 --> 01:25:49.563
I love you, too.

01:26:02.376 --> 01:26:04.344
You really think
she's messing with Lilly?

01:26:04.813 --> 01:26:06.446
She has been acting strange

01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:08.549
ever since she started
talking to her, yeah.

01:26:10.484 --> 01:26:12.486
We can charge her for assault.

01:26:12.519 --> 01:26:13.587
I'll have them bring her in.

01:26:15.089 --> 01:26:16.658
Thanks, man.

01:26:56.998 --> 01:26:58.900
Em, did you just say something?

01:27:35.103 --> 01:27:36.070
Where am I?

01:27:36.671 --> 01:27:38.706
How do you know about Madison?

01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:40.474
Who are you?

01:27:40.507 --> 01:27:41.541
Where's Em?

01:27:42.010 --> 01:27:43.177
Someone help!

01:27:43.211 --> 01:27:44.078
Save your breath.

01:27:44.112 --> 01:27:46.613
- Help!
- Save your breath.

01:27:46.647 --> 01:27:48.816
I could put a bullet
into your skull

01:27:49.951 --> 01:27:52.153
and nobody would hear it.

01:27:52.186 --> 01:27:54.621
How do you know about Madison?

01:27:55.823 --> 01:27:56.791
Lilly!

01:27:56.824 --> 01:27:57.792
Em!

01:27:58.092 --> 01:27:59.626
Let us go!

01:27:59.661 --> 01:28:00.795
Help!

01:28:00.828 --> 01:28:02.030
- Someone help!
- Shut her up!

01:28:02.063 --> 01:28:02.931
Shut her up!

01:28:25.652 --> 01:28:26.921
Don't you hurt her!

01:28:26.955 --> 01:28:27.922
Help!

01:28:45.273 --> 01:28:47.574
Can you think of anything else
Lilly might've said

01:28:47.607 --> 01:28:49.243
or mentioned.

01:28:51.578 --> 01:28:54.514
Besides everything with Diana,

01:28:54.548 --> 01:28:56.217
nothing out of the ordinary.

01:29:00.554 --> 01:29:02.724
We're gonna bring 'em home safe.

01:29:02.757 --> 01:29:04.624
I promise, bud.

01:29:07.095 --> 01:29:08.796
All three of 'em.

01:29:16.671 --> 01:29:18.605
<i>Police are still searching
for the two suspects</i>

01:29:18.638 --> 01:29:20.274
<i>Diana Lee
and an unidentified accomplice</i>

01:29:20.308 --> 01:29:21.776
<i>in the abduction of...</i>

01:29:23.911 --> 01:29:26.247
How can you be
so goddamn careless!

01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:28.783
We can still make it look like
it's her fault.

01:29:28.816 --> 01:29:29.984
Oh!

01:29:30.018 --> 01:29:32.020
I've gotta make
some phone calls.

01:29:32.053 --> 01:29:34.689
This is going to look bad
for business.

01:29:37.992 --> 01:29:40.094
Keep an eye on them downstairs.

01:29:51.105 --> 01:29:52.807
I'm sorry to bother you,
Miss?

01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:54.608
Uh, Joan Morris.

01:29:54.641 --> 01:29:56.778
Ms. Morris,
do you mind if we come in?

01:29:56.811 --> 01:29:59.546
Oh, uh yes, please do.

01:29:59.847 --> 01:30:00.915
Thank you.

01:30:03.384 --> 01:30:05.019
The reason we're here

01:30:05.053 --> 01:30:06.788
is because of the two
missing women.

01:30:06.821 --> 01:30:09.123
Oh, I heard about that,
that is such awful news.

01:30:10.324 --> 01:30:11.993
Yeah.

01:30:12.026 --> 01:30:13.795
Um, Is your husband home?

01:30:14.529 --> 01:30:16.596
Uh, he stepped out
to run an errand.

01:30:17.999 --> 01:30:20.634
We were hoping maybe Jerry saw
someone following them?

01:30:21.335 --> 01:30:22.036
Well.

01:30:23.037 --> 01:30:24.705
He said that they stopped by,

01:30:24.739 --> 01:30:27.607
but I'm sorry that was it.

01:30:30.078 --> 01:30:31.913
Joan, you know the neighborhood
pretty well?

01:30:31.946 --> 01:30:32.880
I do.

01:30:34.215 --> 01:30:36.084
Do you know a little girl
named Madison?

01:30:38.953 --> 01:30:40.288
Um, no, it doesn't ring a bell.

01:30:41.689 --> 01:30:43.891
Madison lives
in this neighborhood.

01:30:43.925 --> 01:30:46.127
No, I'm sorry,
I've never seen her.

01:30:49.831 --> 01:30:52.266
Thank you for your time,
Mrs. Morris.

01:30:52.300 --> 01:30:53.768
Will you have Jerry call me
when he gets home?

01:30:53.801 --> 01:30:54.836
Oh, yeah.

01:31:08.749 --> 01:31:11.419
We're gonna find them,
I don't know how, but it...

01:31:11.452 --> 01:31:12.652
We are gonna find them.

01:31:12.687 --> 01:31:13.988
It's gonna be okay.

01:31:15.690 --> 01:31:17.792
The only record
we have of Madison

01:31:17.825 --> 01:31:19.393
is a missing persons report.

01:31:27.101 --> 01:31:29.904
No, this cannot be the Madison
that Lilly

01:31:29.937 --> 01:31:30.972
was talking about.

01:31:31.005 --> 01:31:31.873
You know her?

01:31:33.808 --> 01:31:35.810
I mean yeah,

01:31:35.843 --> 01:31:37.178
but this was a long time ago.

01:31:38.346 --> 01:31:40.148
Like when we were kids.

01:31:40.181 --> 01:31:41.883
This can't be her.

01:31:41.916 --> 01:31:43.351
She was last seen
with her stepfather

01:31:43.384 --> 01:31:46.053
in that neighborhood
before she went missing.

01:31:46.087 --> 01:31:47.889
In the statement,
he left her in the vehicle

01:31:47.922 --> 01:31:49.690
to ask for directions.

01:31:49.724 --> 01:31:51.392
When he returned, she was gone.

01:31:52.827 --> 01:31:54.395
So where is he now?

01:31:54.862 --> 01:31:56.797
He died last year
from an overdose.

01:32:02.370 --> 01:32:04.205
I got to go back to the station.

01:32:04.238 --> 01:32:05.706
Diana just turned herself in.

01:32:06.507 --> 01:32:07.008
I'm coming with you.

01:32:07.041 --> 01:32:08.075
I wanna talk to her.

01:32:08.109 --> 01:32:09.043
No.

01:32:09.076 --> 01:32:10.044
Phil.

01:32:10.077 --> 01:32:11.779
Will, you stay here.

01:32:11.812 --> 01:32:13.214
I'll call you
after I've talked to her.

01:32:14.849 --> 01:32:16.250
And keep us posted.

01:32:18.419 --> 01:32:20.454
Will, you have to let him
do his job.

01:32:25.126 --> 01:32:26.761
Where are you going?

01:32:26.794 --> 01:32:28.963
I just need to get
some fresh air, okay.

01:32:40.141 --> 01:32:40.975
Lil.

01:32:41.008 --> 01:32:42.009
Em.

01:32:42.944 --> 01:32:44.011
You okay?

01:32:46.314 --> 01:32:47.882
How are you holding up?

01:32:48.149 --> 01:32:50.952
I'm so scared.

01:32:57.024 --> 01:32:58.893
We need to be strong,
okay.

01:32:58.926 --> 01:33:00.261
Okay.

01:33:00.294 --> 01:33:01.162
It's gonna be
okay, I promise.

01:33:01.195 --> 01:33:02.230
Okay.

01:33:02.263 --> 01:33:05.066
I'm gonna do everything
in my power.

01:33:05.099 --> 01:33:07.034
Don't let anything happen,
okay?

01:33:09.337 --> 01:33:11.472
- I love you so.
- I love you.

01:33:14.242 --> 01:33:16.110
I knew it,
I knew it, I knew it.

01:33:17.578 --> 01:33:20.381
I knew this Madison thing
was gonna come back to haunt me.

01:33:20.414 --> 01:33:23.150
We should've taken care
of that crackhead dad sooner.

01:33:24.285 --> 01:33:26.187
I hate loose ends.

01:33:27.221 --> 01:33:29.223
No more loose ends.

01:33:29.257 --> 01:33:30.458
Don't you hurt her!

01:33:30.992 --> 01:33:32.827
Please, please don't hurt her!

01:33:33.194 --> 01:33:34.128
She's pregnant.

01:33:35.162 --> 01:33:36.063
Is she?

01:33:38.933 --> 01:33:41.002
I might keep you around
a little longer then.

01:33:42.370 --> 01:33:44.238
Your baby might be
worth something.

01:33:45.506 --> 01:33:47.475
What did you do to Madison?

01:33:47.508 --> 01:33:50.311
I buried that little whore
years ago.

01:33:51.445 --> 01:33:54.215
Right here
where I'm going to bury you.

01:33:54.248 --> 01:33:55.816
No!

01:33:58.085 --> 01:33:59.854
Em, Em!

01:33:59.887 --> 01:34:01.889
We gotta you to move.

01:34:01.922 --> 01:34:03.057
- Good job.
- Okay.

01:34:06.527 --> 01:34:08.162
Oh my God.

01:34:14.201 --> 01:34:15.269
We have to go.

01:34:16.304 --> 01:34:17.938
- Do you hear that?
- What?

01:34:17.972 --> 01:34:19.206
Do you hear?

01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:20.174
What, what?

01:34:20.207 --> 01:34:21.375
Lil, what are you doing?

01:34:31.185 --> 01:34:32.086
Oh my God!

01:34:36.057 --> 01:34:37.091
It's okay.

01:34:39.026 --> 01:34:40.561
It's okay,
we won't hurt you.

01:34:42.263 --> 01:34:43.130
Come.

01:34:43.164 --> 01:34:44.231
Come on.

01:34:44.265 --> 01:34:45.433
Wait, shh.

01:35:35.449 --> 01:35:36.384
Em!

01:35:37.051 --> 01:35:38.586
Dead girl.

01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:41.255
Don't hurt her, don't hurt her.

01:35:43.324 --> 01:35:45.326
Put the gun down,
put the gun down.

01:35:45.359 --> 01:35:46.160
No.

01:35:46.193 --> 01:35:47.528
Please put the gun down.

01:35:49.330 --> 01:35:50.264
No, no!

01:35:52.333 --> 01:35:54.135
Why are you still standing here!

01:35:54.168 --> 01:35:55.269
Bring them back!

01:35:58.639 --> 01:35:59.306
Fuck!

01:36:00.374 --> 01:36:02.677
This is crazy,
there is no way.

01:36:14.054 --> 01:36:15.589
Goddammit!

01:36:23.631 --> 01:36:25.099
The kids are gone.

01:36:25.132 --> 01:36:26.300
I couldn't find them.

01:36:34.508 --> 01:36:35.543
What now?

01:36:39.246 --> 01:36:42.082
Don't be afraid,
I won't let them hurt you.

01:36:42.116 --> 01:36:43.184
We want to be your baby.

01:36:43.217 --> 01:36:44.251
Madison?

01:36:44.753 --> 01:36:46.420
What did you say?

01:36:47.388 --> 01:36:49.156
They were really mean to me.

01:36:49.190 --> 01:36:51.025
They made me play with old men.

01:36:51.693 --> 01:36:54.094
And when I didn't,
they would hurt me.

01:36:54.128 --> 01:36:54.796
Who's talking?

01:36:54.830 --> 01:36:56.130
We want to be your baby.

01:36:56.163 --> 01:36:57.699
I won't let you hurt her!

01:36:58.098 --> 01:36:59.500
Pick me.

01:37:00.067 --> 01:37:01.502
- Pick me.
- You're dead!

01:37:01.535 --> 01:37:02.704
We buried you!

01:37:02.737 --> 01:37:04.405
We want to be your baby.

01:37:16.217 --> 01:37:17.084
Come on, Em.

01:37:20.154 --> 01:37:21.088
Em.

01:37:21.589 --> 01:37:22.623
No.

01:37:22.657 --> 01:37:24.492
No, no, no, Em.

01:37:30.799 --> 01:37:31.700
It's okay.

01:37:34.568 --> 01:37:36.136
Oh Em!

01:37:38.639 --> 01:37:39.774
I love you.

01:37:40.574 --> 01:37:42.109
I love you, too.

01:37:44.178 --> 01:37:45.747
Don't, don't die.

01:37:46.180 --> 01:37:49.116
I told you I'd be the best aunt
in the world.

01:37:49.751 --> 01:37:52.253
No, no.

01:37:52.286 --> 01:37:53.220
No.

01:38:00.528 --> 01:38:03.364
Emily, please,
please wake up.

01:38:04.131 --> 01:38:06.634
Please,

01:38:06.668 --> 01:38:07.535
please.

01:38:12.206 --> 01:38:14.141
Why do you seem so scared?

01:38:14.475 --> 01:38:16.510
All I wanted to do
is play with you.

01:38:18.747 --> 01:38:21.115
Don't be afraid, I love you.

01:38:21.148 --> 01:38:23.517
You're not afraid of the dark,
are you?

01:38:30.257 --> 01:38:31.392
She's inside.

01:38:32.894 --> 01:38:34.228
Madison?

01:38:39.901 --> 01:38:42.236
Okay, this is crazy!

01:38:50.679 --> 01:38:52.446
Please!

01:38:55.684 --> 01:38:58.118
You, what did you bring here?

01:39:01.422 --> 01:39:02.657
Lil!

01:39:03.024 --> 01:39:05.192
I won't let you hurt her.

01:39:16.270 --> 01:39:17.204
Will!

01:39:19.506 --> 01:39:21.308
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

01:39:46.567 --> 01:39:49.536
Please,

01:39:49.570 --> 01:39:50.638
please.

01:39:57.611 --> 01:39:58.847
Over here, over here.

01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:00.949
Come on, come on.

01:40:12.994 --> 01:40:14.461
Leave her alone.

01:40:16.597 --> 01:40:17.431
It's your world.

01:40:17.464 --> 01:40:18.667
You make it your own.

01:40:22.771 --> 01:40:24.371
Will you come home with me,
Madison?

01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:27.241
Yes.

01:40:52.867 --> 01:40:54.301
Madison.

01:41:22.797 --> 01:41:24.899
Things happen sometimes

01:41:24.933 --> 01:41:26.768
that we can't explain.

01:41:27.601 --> 01:41:30.437
Questions that
seem to have no answers.

01:41:31.973 --> 01:41:34.843
Maybe if we look more closely,

01:41:36.376 --> 01:41:38.813
we'll see the small things
that go unnoticed.

01:41:40.447 --> 01:41:41.916
Feel a little stronger.

01:41:43.383 --> 01:41:45.887
Touch the part of life
that hasn't been reached.

01:41:47.488 --> 01:41:49.590
Pursue a little more intently.

01:41:50.992 --> 01:41:53.527
Hear the voices
that are ignored.

01:41:54.863 --> 01:41:57.065
We become to realise

01:41:57.098 --> 01:42:00.034
that life has already answered

01:42:00.068 --> 01:42:01.736
those questions.

01:42:15.349 --> 01:42:17.284
Alright, time to eat, Emma.

01:42:17.852 --> 01:42:19.721
Mommy, who is Madison?

01:42:20.789 --> 01:42:22.824
They keep calling me "Madison".

01:42:22.857 --> 01:42:24.525
Who keeps calling you "Madison"?

01:42:26.627 --> 01:42:28.529
The people standing behind you.

01:42:40.929 --> 01:42:45.929
