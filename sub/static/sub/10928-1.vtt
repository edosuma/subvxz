00:16.583 --> 00:21.624
This story is not based
on any real-life cases.

01:29.208 --> 01:30.249
Last November,

01:30.458 --> 01:33.499
Hong Kong experienced
the latest typhoon arrival ever in a year.

01:34.041 --> 01:34.874
Typhoon Coral

01:35.083 --> 01:37.749
brought over 200mm of rainfall to Hong Kong.

03:20.500 --> 03:21.624
Man... Wake up,

03:21.750 --> 03:22.540
Man... Thieves.

03:24.041 --> 03:26.249
Wake up, Man. Thieves.

03:26.375 --> 03:27.082
Shut up!

04:05.125 --> 04:06.124
Answer your phone.

04:13.625 --> 04:14.624
Van 71 calling.

04:15.125 --> 04:15.874
Van 71 .

04:16.333 --> 04:17.790
Container Port Road South in Kwai Chung,

04:17.916 --> 04:20.374
near street light CC0381 .

04:20.500 --> 04:22.290
There's a TADO (Traffic Accident Damage Only).

04:22.416 --> 04:25.124
Someone's hurt, looks conscious.
Wait for more detail.

04:25.416 --> 04:26.165
Mister, you're hurt.

04:26.291 --> 04:26.915
Do you need an ambulance?

04:27.041 --> 04:29.374
You shut up! I can't understand
Chinese. Piss off!

04:29.458 --> 04:30.457
Get the fuck out of here man!

04:30.583 --> 04:31.582
You are suspected of dangerous
and drunk driving.

04:31.666 --> 04:32.457
Don't touch me, don't touch me.

04:32.541 --> 04:34.624
Shut up. Don't fucking touch me! All right.

04:34.750 --> 04:36.457
Hey, watch your tongue. Quit the foul language.

04:36.583 --> 04:37.374
Show me your ID card.

04:37.500 --> 04:39.040
What ID card? No!

04:39.208 --> 04:40.624
Do I need to carry an ID card?

04:40.750 --> 04:41.290
If you don't show us,

04:41.375 --> 04:41.957
we'll take you to the police station right now.

04:42.083 --> 04:43.124
Do you know who my uncle is?

04:45.041 --> 04:45.374
Sit down!

04:45.500 --> 04:46.082
Shut up.

04:46.791 --> 04:47.707
Calm down.

04:47.875 --> 04:48.540
Sit still there.

04:48.750 --> 04:51.957
Hello? Yeah! Uncle! Yeah, this is Brian.

04:52.166 --> 04:53.874
These dumbass police won't let me go right now.

04:54.666 --> 04:58.957
All right! You! Take the phone!

05:01.333 --> 05:05.374
Hello? This is Emergency Unit
commander M.Y. Shum.

05:05.583 --> 05:06.707
He's suspected of drunk driving.

05:07.500 --> 05:08.582
What's his relationship to you?

05:15.666 --> 05:17.999
Uncle, yeah! Can I go now?

05:18.125 --> 05:21.207
Hello? A man crashed his car
and was suspected of drunk driving.

05:21.833 --> 05:23.374
He said his uncle is a judge.

05:23.500 --> 05:23.915
What? They're mad dogs.

05:24.041 --> 05:24.582
I must go.

05:25.416 --> 05:28.707
I... have to go. Hello?

05:30.291 --> 05:31.082
Arrest him!

05:46.583 --> 05:47.540
Joe

05:54.541 --> 05:57.249
We're cops, not mad dogs.

05:57.666 --> 06:00.707
If you assault cops, I could beat you to death!

06:10.500 --> 06:12.040
Vincent, these are the documents you want.

06:12.250 --> 06:12.957
Thank you.

06:20.875 --> 06:24.290
Lau, Commissioner Tsang's flight
just arrived in Copenhagen.

06:24.708 --> 06:25.790
His mobile is still off.

06:26.375 --> 06:28.165
Headquarters Command Control Centre said,

06:28.291 --> 06:29.249
apart from the Police Public Relations Branch

06:29.625 --> 06:30.540
and Headquarters Command Control Centre,

06:30.666 --> 06:31.999
at least three G4 tactical teams

06:32.125 --> 06:33.249
took action 1 5 minutes ago.

06:33.833 --> 06:34.624
Is it that serious?

06:34.750 --> 06:36.374
There's more.

06:36.708 --> 06:39.165
Twenty minutes ago, Deputy Police
Commissioner Lee as Acting Commissioner

06:39.333 --> 06:41.165
announced a Tier One Response.

06:46.375 --> 06:47.040
Something's up.

06:58.458 --> 06:59.707
Sir

07:00.166 --> 07:00.790
Lau.

07:01.166 --> 07:03.915
The big show tonight is obviously against you.
Watch out.

07:15.833 --> 07:17.374
Save the formality. Time is short.

07:17.666 --> 07:18.707
Albert, let's start.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.624
We called you all back so late

07:22.083 --> 07:23.457
because of two things.

07:23.958 --> 07:26.040
First, an hour and a half ago,

07:26.791 --> 07:28.832
an explosive went off outside
the Broadway Mong Kok cinema.

07:29.416 --> 07:30.749
So far no casualties have been reported.

07:31.541 --> 07:33.582
Second, last night at 23:00,

07:33.708 --> 07:35.040
an Emergency Unit van in New Territories South

07:35.166 --> 07:37.415
hadn't reported to the Command Centre
for 30 minutes.

07:37.708 --> 07:38.707
At 23:1 9,

07:38.916 --> 07:41.415
our report room received
an anonymous phone call.

07:41.875 --> 07:42.582
Leanne

07:43.208 --> 07:45.457
An Emergency Unit van, with five cops,

07:45.583 --> 07:48.332
and all the equipment in the van.
What's it all worth?

07:49.250 --> 07:50.082
Michael

07:51.375 --> 07:52.499
The Emergency Unit
control centre confirmed that

07:52.750 --> 07:55.457
No. NTS 71 is still out of contact.

07:56.250 --> 07:59.665
Regional Command records show
No. 71 was mid-shift.

07:59.791 --> 08:02.457
At 22:44, it had just dealt
with a drunkard causing trouble.

08:02.625 --> 08:04.165
They continued on with work
and then went missing.

08:04.750 --> 08:06.082
Not only the EU van,

08:06.708 --> 08:08.874
but also the phones
of the five officers went dead.

08:09.708 --> 08:11.874
We all know GPS isn't exact.

08:12.833 --> 08:14.040
Besides radio records,

08:14.541 --> 08:15.582
we activated the Major Incident Investigation

08:15.666 --> 08:17.249
and Disaster Support System

08:17.875 --> 08:19.790
and locked down a 20km radius.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.165
New Territories South sent out two EU vans
and patrol cars to follow up.

08:23.375 --> 08:24.249
Up to now...

08:25.625 --> 08:28.249
Lau. Up to this point, what do you think?

08:32.125 --> 08:33.332
Michael's deployment is right.

08:33.707 --> 08:35.457
But I'd call in everyone

08:35.582 --> 08:36.789
related to cases

08:36.916 --> 08:38.457
handled earlier by No. 71

08:38.666 --> 08:39.957
to assist in our investigation.

08:40.082 --> 08:41.957
We've already done what you've just said.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.915
Listen, on the face of it,

08:47.041 --> 08:49.582
the Mong Kok bomb and the hijacked van

08:49.833 --> 08:51.332
can't be random incidents

08:52.125 --> 08:53.665
as they happened around the same time.

08:54.041 --> 08:54.957
23 minutes ago,

08:55.083 --> 08:56.749
I activated the Emergency Response System

08:57.083 --> 08:59.290
and this is the Provisional Command Centre.

08:59.541 --> 09:01.915
To, you're the Director of IT.

09:02.166 --> 09:03.082
I want you to explain

09:03.333 --> 09:04.707
why this happened.

09:08.041 --> 09:11.040
Lee, as the Supervisory Board
and computer section heads aren't here,

09:11.541 --> 09:12.374
let me answer for...

09:12.500 --> 09:14.040
I'm asking about the technical stuff.

09:14.250 --> 09:15.374
Can you give an answer?

09:17.083 --> 09:17.957
To!

09:19.333 --> 09:20.707
Given today's technology and resources,

09:21.250 --> 09:23.165
the hijackers can only block a channel.

09:23.666 --> 09:24.707
Beyond our department,

09:24.875 --> 09:26.957
no one knows what frequency we use.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.624
It's simple.
We'll check with the Broadcasting Authority

09:29.750 --> 09:31.874
to see where TV and radio signals
in New Territories South

09:31.958 --> 09:33.040
had interference.

09:33.166 --> 09:35.332
We can then locate
where the hijacking took place.

09:35.458 --> 09:36.749
Our budget was cut,

09:37.041 --> 09:38.499
and $540 million was spent

09:38.666 --> 09:39.540
over six years for

09:39.791 --> 09:41.165
so-called state-of-the-art technology.

09:42.958 --> 09:44.374
The Commissioner is in Copenhagen right now

09:44.541 --> 09:45.999
boasting about how safe Hong Kong is,

09:46.333 --> 09:47.374
how professional the police is.

09:47.708 --> 09:49.124
How could we imagine this ridiculous system

09:49.250 --> 09:51.624
would let a whole team and

09:51.708 --> 09:52.874
a police van vanish without a trace?

09:53.625 --> 09:55.290
I could draw conclusions now.

09:55.625 --> 09:56.957
Two possibilities.

09:57.208 --> 09:59.124
First, there's a mole in the force.

09:59.500 --> 10:02.874
Second, there's a serious loophole
in our communications system.

10:03.083 --> 10:05.249
It's your department's responsibility, To.

10:06.125 --> 10:07.457
Albert, carry on.

10:07.625 --> 10:08.790
According to the armoury's records,

10:08.958 --> 10:11.707
Van No. 71 was fully loaded.

10:12.125 --> 10:13.124
Five officers were on board.

10:13.583 --> 10:15.457
Driver Johnny Wong, 691 1 ,

10:15.750 --> 10:17.957
plainclothes detective Kelvin Chang, 60625,

10:18.125 --> 10:20.207
Sergeant M.Y. Shum, 48475,

10:20.375 --> 10:22.957
Communicator C.M. Leung, 38543

10:23.375 --> 10:28.707
and Joe Lee, 78633, sitting in the rear seat.

10:31.541 --> 10:33.707
I'm treating this as a terrorist incident.

10:34.333 --> 10:37.999
Considering its gravity,
I've decided to take charge.

10:38.208 --> 10:40.582
The operation code is Cold War.

10:43.250 --> 10:45.707
Listen up, taking police officers hostage

10:45.791 --> 10:47.624
is never tolerated in Hong Kong.

10:47.875 --> 10:48.874
Never!

10:49.916 --> 10:52.707
Lau, my team is ready.

11:01.666 --> 11:02.540
You have to watch To closely.

11:09.583 --> 11:11.165
To make an EU van disappear,

11:12.166 --> 11:13.915
you'd not just block the GPS in the van

11:14.083 --> 11:15.624
and cut all uploads and downloads,

11:16.333 --> 11:17.332
but also kill its radio.

11:18.416 --> 11:20.790
80% of Hong Kong's highways
are equipped with cameras.

11:21.125 --> 11:22.749
Even if they all fail, it doesn't matter.

11:24.458 --> 11:28.540
What's best about the third-generation
communication system is this:

11:29.166 --> 11:31.082
every officer's radio has GPS.

11:31.333 --> 11:34.374
Even if it's turned off,
we can switch it on via central computer.

11:36.791 --> 11:37.749
How come I didn't know that?

11:37.958 --> 11:39.124
It's the Cat. 2 setup.

11:39.666 --> 11:41.540
Not even
the legislature's Finance Committee knows.

11:42.333 --> 11:45.624
You're an admin executive,
so of course you wouldn't know.

11:46.458 --> 11:46.999
In other words,

11:47.083 --> 11:48.874
every policeman is wearing a bug?

11:49.583 --> 11:52.499
Not a bug - a secret weapon!

11:57.583 --> 12:00.040
Listen! The data shows the abducted officers

12:00.166 --> 12:02.749
are being held at the shipyard on
Tam Kon Shan Road in Tsing Yi.

12:03.291 --> 12:04.999
Until now, our EU van

12:05.291 --> 12:07.207
and its weapons are still missing.

12:07.541 --> 12:08.582
We have to speed up.

12:15.375 --> 12:18.540
Because of his son,
Lee has made this whole deployment mess.

12:18.583 --> 12:19.165
Hmm.

12:19.541 --> 12:22.082
Time is so tight and
Criminal Intelligence Bureau isn't involved.

12:23.083 --> 12:24.707
Our men will be put in danger.

12:25.625 --> 12:26.040
Hmm.

12:26.125 --> 12:26.749
Lau.

12:27.708 --> 12:30.207
Do you think there's a mole in the force?

12:30.750 --> 12:31.415
No, I don't.

12:35.416 --> 12:36.999
Maybe there's something wrong
with our communications system.

12:40.375 --> 12:42.124
What's wrong is the operation code name.

13:10.458 --> 13:10.874
Lau.

13:19.166 --> 13:19.790
Lee.

13:19.916 --> 13:20.665
You can get ready to open the window.

13:27.416 --> 13:29.540
Lee, can we talk a while?

13:41.375 --> 13:42.874
I understand Joe is on the hostage list.

13:43.041 --> 13:44.624
But should you let Albert take charge of it?

13:46.583 --> 13:47.707
I just saw the floor plans

13:48.250 --> 13:49.707
they're using are three years old

13:49.750 --> 13:50.624
and don't have Building Department's chop.

13:51.166 --> 13:52.457
Since the position has been located,

13:52.833 --> 13:54.332
shouldn't we plan everything first
before storming in?

13:56.208 --> 13:57.999
Don't go any further. It's dangerous outside.

13:59.041 --> 13:59.540
Albert

14:07.333 --> 14:08.040
Don't worry.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.165
Fellows, this is M.B. Lee speaking.

14:20.416 --> 14:21.374
Listen to my orders.

14:27.416 --> 14:28.082
Go.

14:46.291 --> 14:46.790
(In Urdu) I'm fine. How are you there?

14:46.875 --> 14:48.790
Hey! Put the phone down.

14:48.958 --> 14:51.874
Who are you? What are you here for?

14:52.708 --> 14:53.874
Put the phone down now!

14:54.333 --> 14:55.957
Cops! Get up!

14:57.458 --> 14:58.707
Put it down! Or I'll fucking shoot you.

14:58.875 --> 15:00.249
- Put down your gun.
- Target Lock, Target Lock

15:00.375 --> 15:00.915
Fire!

15:20.666 --> 15:21.249
Freeze!

15:23.291 --> 15:24.624
Stand still. Don't move.

15:26.041 --> 15:26.457
Don't move.

15:27.375 --> 15:28.624
Police! Don't move.

15:56.416 --> 15:58.290
Team C, insert the optical fibres now.

16:07.541 --> 16:09.499
Team C, approaching
the hostages' suspected location.

16:20.083 --> 16:22.957
Sir, we've found lots of mannequins
with radios and bombs.

16:27.625 --> 16:30.957
I'm very confident that

16:31.208 --> 16:34.082
Hong Kong remains the safest Asian city.

16:34.166 --> 16:35.165
This reputation...

17:09.375 --> 17:10.124
Sir.

17:10.500 --> 17:11.332
Open the door

17:11.583 --> 17:12.457
Sorry sir.

17:13.958 --> 17:14.874
Open the door.

17:15.040 --> 17:17.332
We're afraid we can't, sir.

17:18.875 --> 17:21.707
If Albert is with Lee, tell Albert that

17:21.958 --> 17:22.957
I want to see him.

17:42.041 --> 17:46.124
Tier One Response! How dare he?

17:50.958 --> 17:52.249
What can I help you with?

17:57.458 --> 17:58.332
I believe

17:59.333 --> 18:02.957
intelligence is key to a successful operation.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.665
If you can't read any information

18:05.750 --> 18:07.707
because of your rank, just let me know.

18:11.375 --> 18:13.332
I suspect this hijacking case

18:14.791 --> 18:16.415
is somehow linked to M.B. Lee and his son.

18:21.333 --> 18:23.957
I want to see Lee's conduct report
at the executive council meeting

18:24.666 --> 18:25.999
and his background check.

18:31.041 --> 18:32.124
I'll send you a copy

18:32.375 --> 18:33.374
in an hour.

18:33.750 --> 18:34.832
Thank you. Mr Luk.

18:39.791 --> 18:41.290
Trust your own judgment.

18:42.500 --> 18:45.415
Extreme times require extreme measures.

18:46.208 --> 18:47.290
I understand.

18:59.250 --> 19:01.624
(To: Commissioner of Police)

19:17.958 --> 19:18.582
Come in.

19:20.875 --> 19:21.499
Looking for me?

19:22.250 --> 19:22.790
Come in.

19:30.041 --> 19:30.665
Coffee.

19:30.916 --> 19:31.540
Thank you.

19:32.375 --> 19:33.124
Sit down.

19:41.500 --> 19:42.540
Did you get any leads from the questioning?

19:45.291 --> 19:46.457
I passed by the room but wasn't allowed in,

19:47.250 --> 19:48.832
even at my rank.

19:49.875 --> 19:51.582
Those South Asians were just being used.

19:54.458 --> 19:55.624
Secretary Luk just came by.

19:57.250 --> 19:58.582
You should have run into him

19:58.833 --> 20:00.082
if the interrogation finished earlier.

20:12.125 --> 20:13.207
Cut to the chase.

20:14.625 --> 20:16.290
I understand how Lee feels.

20:17.625 --> 20:19.415
But we're the top management
of disciplined forces.

20:19.958 --> 20:21.374
His role as a father
can't override his role as a policeman

20:21.833 --> 20:24.832
when he makes decisions.

20:28.500 --> 20:29.957
I know Secretary Luk thinks highly of you.

20:32.250 --> 20:33.707
He must have made a deal with you.

20:35.458 --> 20:36.165
Yes, he did.

20:36.750 --> 20:37.707
Can you tell me about it?

20:40.416 --> 20:41.582
Just not now.

20:44.416 --> 20:45.082
OK.

20:47.833 --> 20:49.415
What you've just said,

20:49.833 --> 20:51.207
I can't pass it on for you.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.624
Please tell my boss directly.

20:56.791 --> 20:57.707
Just disregard this visit.

21:03.625 --> 21:04.915
In fact, I prefer latte.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.457
An Emergency Unit van, with five cops

21:17.708 --> 21:18.957
and all the equipment in the van.

21:19.791 --> 21:20.665
What's it all worth?

21:22.833 --> 21:25.999
I'll contact you again before 3 pm today.

21:26.166 --> 21:28.415
Ignore him. Don't save us. Don't!

21:37.500 --> 21:38.665
Has the Commissioner been informed?

21:40.541 --> 21:42.624
Have you checked the file's properties?

21:42.750 --> 21:43.374
We tried.

21:44.041 --> 21:45.665
But they've been overwritten.

21:48.291 --> 21:50.915
It's almost 9.
We'd normally issue a press release now.

21:51.833 --> 21:53.540
Lau, if I were you

21:53.666 --> 21:55.415
I'd tell Lee about this video right away.

21:58.750 --> 22:01.124
Lau, 20 minutes ago

22:01.416 --> 22:03.749
a hijacker called 999 once
with an unregistered mobile phone.

22:04.708 --> 22:05.915
He asked if we'd finished the calculation.

22:06.541 --> 22:08.540
I've set up another system
in the conference room

22:08.833 --> 22:09.832
to help your work.

22:11.041 --> 22:12.374
A video from the hijacker.

22:13.750 --> 22:14.332
Yes,

22:14.416 --> 22:16.957
call IT and forensics
to the Commissioner's room.

22:17.666 --> 22:18.457
Now!

22:18.875 --> 22:20.665
An Emergency Unit van, with five cops,

22:21.000 --> 22:22.249
and all the equipment in the van.

22:23.083 --> 22:23.874
What's it all worth?

22:25.666 --> 22:28.457
I'll contact you again before 3 pm today.

22:28.583 --> 22:30.832
Ignore him. Don't save us. Don't!

22:31.166 --> 22:31.749
Lau.

22:31.833 --> 22:33.832
The total sum based
on your estimate is on the last page.

22:33.958 --> 22:35.332
The riddle is about an EU van,

22:35.541 --> 22:37.332
five cops and all the equipment.

22:38.125 --> 22:39.457
It's easy to calculate.

22:39.833 --> 22:41.374
Probably not more than $45 million.

22:42.666 --> 22:45.207
No, it can't be that simple.

22:45.416 --> 22:46.499
There must be something left out.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.749
When it comes to money, everyone wants more.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.124
If this is the answer,
they underrate us too much.

22:52.375 --> 22:54.790
Who are these people?
Daring to pull such a big stunt?

22:56.041 --> 22:57.374
The former Commissioner taught me,

22:57.625 --> 23:00.957
the biggest enemy of the Police Force
is always from inside.

23:01.791 --> 23:03.874
Vincent, I want a list of

23:04.083 --> 23:05.665
all dismissed staff since the handover.

23:06.166 --> 23:07.832
I can think of no more than five people

23:07.916 --> 23:09.790
capable to taking down the Hong Kong police.

23:10.541 --> 23:14.332
What a coincidence.
Part of puzzle is the five cops being held.

23:18.708 --> 23:21.165
May, call the Administration Bureau.

23:21.291 --> 23:22.582
Find out the death compensation
for an officer's family.

23:43.958 --> 23:46.082
Five policemen. Why could it cost so much?

23:46.375 --> 23:48.040
Preparing for the worst.

23:48.916 --> 23:50.457
It's assuming all five of them die.

23:58.375 --> 24:00.832
Lau, the man has been confirmed.

24:01.041 --> 24:03.207
He's the driver, Johnny Wong.
The hijackers are animals!

24:03.375 --> 24:04.040
How is he?

24:05.041 --> 24:06.874
He was found unconscious.

24:07.375 --> 24:09.415
Accident and Emergency
suspected a heart attack.

24:09.875 --> 24:11.790
CCTV captured the van dropping him off.

24:12.250 --> 24:13.457
The van's plates have been confirmed as fake.

24:16.833 --> 24:19.040
They're obviously testing our limits,

24:19.875 --> 24:20.957
especially Lee's.

24:21.833 --> 24:22.582
Attention.

24:23.541 --> 24:25.707
It's been more than 1 0 hours

24:26.625 --> 24:28.749
since our EU van disappeared last night.

24:29.875 --> 24:33.749
Not long ago, the hijackers
left a seriously wounded officer

24:34.458 --> 24:36.082
at a hospital Accident and Emergency entrance.

24:36.875 --> 24:40.832
This action is seriously
provoking the Police Force.

24:41.375 --> 24:43.165
I'll inform the Security Bureau later

24:43.541 --> 24:45.207
and sign the executive directive.

24:45.666 --> 24:48.499
Due to the increasing gravity of the case

24:48.916 --> 24:52.707
I'm now activating Tier Two Response.

24:53.083 --> 24:54.207
All districts' morning duties

24:54.375 --> 24:56.915
will be extended for two hours.

24:57.333 --> 24:59.832
All front-line staff must cancel their leave.

25:00.791 --> 25:04.499
Inform the Marine Police,
the airport and public transport.

25:04.833 --> 25:06.582
I need two-thirds of the Police Force

25:06.708 --> 25:08.790
in the rescue operation.

25:16.458 --> 25:17.540
I want to dismiss Lee from duty.

25:17.666 --> 25:18.499
Impossible.

25:18.916 --> 25:19.665
Why?

25:19.916 --> 25:22.499
If you want to take over from Lee,
according to the structure,

25:23.291 --> 25:24.999
you need to dismiss him as Acting Commissioner.

25:25.750 --> 25:29.624
You need to prove dereliction of duty
or his inability to handle duties

25:29.708 --> 25:30.790
due to health reasons.

25:31.250 --> 25:34.165
And the whole procedure takes about two weeks.

25:34.291 --> 25:38.207
Right. That's the normal procedure,
but not now.

25:39.541 --> 25:41.415
Don't you remember what you told me last night

25:41.875 --> 25:42.874
when I came back to headquarters?

25:43.041 --> 25:45.665
Lee activated Tier One Response 20 minutes ago

25:45.833 --> 25:47.790
in his capacity as Acting Commissioner.

25:47.916 --> 25:48.999
Since last night,

25:49.291 --> 25:51.249
as head of the Police Force,

25:51.416 --> 25:52.499
Lee announced Tier One Response

25:52.833 --> 25:55.415
without consulting management.

25:56.875 --> 25:58.249
He did it simply to

25:58.375 --> 25:59.665
deploy the force easily.

26:00.666 --> 26:04.749
He's already done
the most difficult part for us.

26:10.583 --> 26:12.415
To apply state of emergency laws,

26:14.208 --> 26:16.915
you need at least five votes
from police officer management.

26:17.500 --> 26:18.999
Currently, half of the members
are in Copenhagen.

26:23.458 --> 26:24.582
You don't have five votes.

26:28.166 --> 26:29.207
Albert

26:30.541 --> 26:31.457
Albert Kwong?

26:32.541 --> 26:33.999
He's always been on Lee's side,

26:35.333 --> 26:38.332
but still, he has the highest
academic qualifications in management

26:39.666 --> 26:41.915
and will have a PhD in law in six months.

26:42.375 --> 26:43.540
He understands

26:43.875 --> 26:45.874
the rule of law better than any of us.

26:46.500 --> 26:50.207
I just talked to him. He's hesitating.

27:11.125 --> 27:12.374
Thanks, Albert.

27:13.500 --> 27:15.249
This time it's solely based
on legal-system considerations.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.832
If I discover that you have any trick
in this to harm my boss,

27:20.000 --> 27:21.415
I'll do even worse to you in return.

27:24.833 --> 27:25.999
I won't let you down.

27:27.833 --> 27:28.874
When should we take action?

27:31.250 --> 27:32.040
In three minutes.

27:33.083 --> 27:33.957
Why?

27:34.416 --> 27:36.707
Give Lee some time. He's helping us get votes.

27:40.250 --> 27:40.957
Morning, Mr Lee.

27:41.458 --> 27:42.665
Any breaking news I should follow up?

27:42.833 --> 27:43.874
Take a look at the headlines.

27:43.958 --> 27:44.457
If there's no problem,

27:44.541 --> 27:46.415
I'll send you
the Chinese and English versions.

27:47.333 --> 27:50.624
Article 8b isn't right.
Operation Cold War is still going on.

27:51.125 --> 27:52.790
I don't want to announce
the emergency status to the public.

27:53.916 --> 27:54.749
I don't get it.

27:55.250 --> 27:56.415
I said it clear enough.

27:56.541 --> 27:57.915
Do you need me to repeat it?

27:58.375 --> 27:59.957
You just asked me to censor the news.

28:00.291 --> 28:02.624
Lee. I don't think this is
in the Commissioner's authority.

28:03.166 --> 28:05.457
Wrong. I know the Police Ordinance
better than you.

28:05.791 --> 28:07.207
I absolutely have this authority.

28:08.458 --> 28:10.082
I've served two commissioners before.

28:10.208 --> 28:12.040
Neither of them ever made

28:12.166 --> 28:13.249
such a request for our department.

28:13.375 --> 28:14.999
That's because they didn't know how to.

28:16.500 --> 28:18.040
Listen to my order now.

28:18.166 --> 28:19.624
Without my approval,

28:19.875 --> 28:22.207
don't release articles 8 to 1 0 to the public.

28:22.416 --> 28:23.290
Understand?

28:28.375 --> 28:30.749
The operation is still going on.
I agree to coordinate with you.

28:30.958 --> 28:33.457
But on the state of emergency,
I can't keep it confidential for you

28:33.625 --> 28:35.665
because every Hong Kong citizen
has the right to know

28:35.791 --> 28:37.499
about the safety of where they live.

28:38.375 --> 28:40.582
If you don't withdraw your request, I won't go.

28:42.083 --> 28:44.332
Which is more important?

28:44.833 --> 28:46.540
The public's right to know
or the safety of police officers?

28:46.833 --> 28:49.540
News and safety are separate things.

28:49.791 --> 28:51.499
If you want me to ignore established procedures

28:51.708 --> 28:52.957
and follow your order,

28:53.250 --> 28:55.124
that is rule by an individual,
not rule by law, sir

29:05.208 --> 29:08.832
Phoenix, are you implying
that I'm abusing my duty?

29:10.708 --> 29:11.874
I don't mean that.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.415
Do you know I can suspend
your duty immediately?

29:15.791 --> 29:16.499
I know.

29:16.833 --> 29:19.624
The Commissioner and Acting Commissioner
have such an authority.

29:21.958 --> 29:23.040
What are you here for?

29:23.166 --> 29:24.249
I want to discuss something with you.

29:27.791 --> 29:30.457
Call all detectives with inspector rank
or above to come over.

29:30.625 --> 29:33.082
Have them bring their pistols. All of them.

29:36.291 --> 29:37.290
What's it about?

29:38.375 --> 29:39.082
Lee.

29:39.875 --> 29:41.124
I think it's too much.

29:41.583 --> 29:43.874
That's why you call up
so many constables to suppress me!

29:44.375 --> 29:45.332
I don't mean that.

29:45.458 --> 29:46.749
"I don't mean that"?

29:47.583 --> 29:49.040
You two match each other.

29:50.041 --> 29:51.665
I heard you used to date.

29:52.125 --> 29:53.915
No wonder you spoke the same way.

29:56.958 --> 29:57.749
Lee.

29:58.875 --> 30:00.665
The EU van belongs to New Territories South.

30:01.083 --> 30:03.332
Their head should take charge.

30:03.958 --> 30:04.832
This is headquarters.

30:05.666 --> 30:06.540
You and I have our duties.

30:06.666 --> 30:08.374
Since the handover, the Deputy Commissioners

30:08.500 --> 30:10.165
and even the Assistant Commissioners
shouldn't be directly involved.

30:10.916 --> 30:13.624
In other words,
you also think I'm abusing my power?

30:14.416 --> 30:15.582
I understand how you feel

30:16.375 --> 30:17.582
but I worry that your emotions
affected your judgment.

30:17.666 --> 30:18.415
I'm asking you: Yes or no?

30:18.500 --> 30:19.290
Yes.

30:22.541 --> 30:23.957
Lee. The case is serious.

30:24.083 --> 30:26.415
But objectively speaking,
your reaction is over the top.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.624
Sean Lau. You should know that

30:39.750 --> 30:41.082
I don't need any reason

30:41.750 --> 30:43.165
to suspend you from duty immediately.

30:43.500 --> 30:44.165
I know.

30:45.625 --> 30:47.665
But I have that power too.

30:47.750 --> 30:50.457
With what you just said,
plus these few constables,

30:50.875 --> 30:52.624
it's enough for me to charge
you with insulting your supervisor.

30:54.708 --> 30:57.290
Albert, go out with Lau.

31:00.791 --> 31:01.790
Albert

31:04.958 --> 31:06.040
Take them away.

31:07.666 --> 31:08.082
Sorry, Lau

31:08.208 --> 31:09.082
What are you doing here? Are you crazy?

31:09.208 --> 31:10.374
Put down your gun. Stand at the back.

31:16.583 --> 31:18.665
This has never happened since the handover.

31:19.500 --> 31:21.124
In other countries,

31:21.291 --> 31:22.207
it'd be a coup d'etat.

31:24.458 --> 31:25.874
I'm now the Acting Commissioner.

31:26.291 --> 31:28.499
At 09:06, Sean Lau,

31:29.291 --> 31:30.707
I officially suspend you from duty.

31:34.916 --> 31:36.665
Lee, there are rules in the Police Force.

31:36.750 --> 31:37.665
If a case involves a relative,

31:37.750 --> 31:38.665
one should make a declaration.

31:38.791 --> 31:39.540
I'm not commanding the operation

31:39.625 --> 31:40.332
You obviously failed to do so.

31:40.625 --> 31:41.124
It proved that

31:41.250 --> 31:42.624
your judgment was in question.

31:42.708 --> 31:43.207
It's not a matter of which region
or department.

31:43.291 --> 31:43.957
I question your ability.

31:44.250 --> 31:44.707
Fairly speaking

31:44.791 --> 31:45.832
- you should hand over your power.
- This time the hijackers are exploiting

31:45.916 --> 31:47.082
This'll be best for everyone.

31:47.208 --> 31:47.915
our communication system's loopholes.

31:48.041 --> 31:48.874
- If you disagree,
- It's a terrorist attack.

31:48.958 --> 31:49.999
sorry Deputy Commissioner M.B. Lee.

31:50.125 --> 31:50.665
Don't form any factions in front of me!

31:50.791 --> 31:51.665
I'll temporarily halt your duty

31:51.791 --> 31:52.499
I won't be afraid of you,

31:52.583 --> 31:53.832
under the Public Interest and Safety Ordinance.
even you have Security Bureau support.

31:53.916 --> 31:54.540
Bullshit.

31:55.333 --> 31:56.207
Are you trying to seize power?

31:57.208 --> 31:58.207
Do you have enough votes?

31:58.625 --> 31:59.207
Sir

31:59.333 --> 32:00.082
What is it?

32:02.000 --> 32:03.082
The Commissioner's call.

32:03.208 --> 32:04.874
He's asking for
the chief commander of Cold War.

32:08.041 --> 32:09.082
Is this the Commissioner's idea?

32:19.000 --> 32:19.624
Commissioner Tsang.

32:19.708 --> 32:22.790
Lau, are you in charge of Cold War now?

32:26.166 --> 32:26.749
Yes.

32:27.458 --> 32:28.874
Is Lee around?

32:29.916 --> 32:31.040
He's right here.

32:31.750 --> 32:34.040
Vincent and Albert are around too.

32:34.916 --> 32:35.332
Good.

32:35.458 --> 32:37.124
I'll take the earliest flight back.

32:37.333 --> 32:38.165
Lau , M.B.

32:38.583 --> 32:40.415
don't let the situation get any worse.

32:40.750 --> 32:42.749
Phoenix, keep in contact.

32:43.541 --> 32:45.874
Yes sir, thank you sir.

33:07.916 --> 33:08.624
Attention please.

33:09.666 --> 33:11.582
Acting Commissioner M.B. Lee
just surrendered power

33:11.750 --> 33:13.165
in operation Cold War

33:14.041 --> 33:15.832
for personal and health reasons.

33:16.208 --> 33:18.290
In accordance with
Police Ordinance Chapter 232 Section 1 6

33:19.250 --> 33:21.457
gazette police officers
and at least two deputy commissioners

33:21.583 --> 33:23.707
have concurred that from now on,

33:24.791 --> 33:25.749
at 09:1 2,

33:26.875 --> 33:29.915
Deputy Commissioner Sean Lau
will be Acting Commissioner

33:30.375 --> 33:32.957
and chief commander of operation Cold War. Lau.

33:35.875 --> 33:40.040
Listen, you should all know that we are now

33:41.416 --> 33:43.249
at a disadvantage
in terms of time and situation.

33:44.458 --> 33:47.290
We have to strike a balance
between maintaining Hong Kong safety

33:47.958 --> 33:49.540
and rescuing the hostages.

33:50.416 --> 33:53.582
First, remove all emergency status warnings.

33:54.166 --> 33:56.249
All departments, including PTU,

33:56.791 --> 33:58.665
G4 and SDU,

33:59.541 --> 34:03.290
should resume normal duties.
We can't let the hijackers know

34:04.458 --> 34:07.040
we made such a huge deployment because of them.

34:08.125 --> 34:10.956
Second, considering this could be a long fight,

34:12.166 --> 34:15.290
I now assign Senior Superintendents
Vincent Tsui and Albert Kwong

34:15.750 --> 34:17.123
as deputy commanders of operation Cold War.

34:18.041 --> 34:20.123
Members in the provisional command centre
need to set up a duty roster:

34:20.958 --> 34:25.081
two shifts for the command centre
and three for other departments,

34:25.208 --> 34:27.665
to be in force until the case is closed
or Commissioner Tsang returns.

34:28.750 --> 34:29.623
Get to work!

34:36.333 --> 34:37.040
Hello?

34:37.291 --> 34:38.040
Who are you?

34:38.916 --> 34:40.706
Why is my colleague's mobile in your hands?

34:41.583 --> 34:43.040
Who are you?

34:43.791 --> 34:46.040
My surname is Lau, Sean Lau.

34:46.291 --> 34:48.498
There are three people in the Police Force
with the same name:

34:49.250 --> 34:50.831
one in the Marine Police, one is a constable,

34:50.958 --> 34:52.081
another is the Deputy Commissioner of Police.

34:52.833 --> 34:54.165
I'm the Acting Commissioner.

34:54.708 --> 34:55.623
I'm asking you

34:56.083 --> 34:58.165
why our colleague's phone is in your hands

34:58.333 --> 34:59.665
I called you up.

34:59.833 --> 35:02.082
Watch your manner when you talk to me.

35:02.166 --> 35:03.290
How will you release the hostages?

35:03.625 --> 35:05.457
Don't go to school
if you haven't done your homework.

35:05.875 --> 35:08.249
Remember, your cops are in my hands!

35:08.375 --> 35:10.374
And, you're not Sean Lau.

35:10.833 --> 35:14.207
Tell Sean Lau to answer
my call in three minutes.

35:17.416 --> 35:19.040
The phone signal started from
Ting Kau Bridge northbound

35:19.291 --> 35:21.249
towards Castle Peak Road.
Total duration 28 seconds.

35:21.583 --> 35:22.457
The suspect should be in a vehicle.

35:22.750 --> 35:23.790
Get video footage from Transport Department.

35:25.166 --> 35:26.915
I want his psychoanalysis and risk assessment.

35:27.041 --> 35:28.582
What SIM card is he using? Which mobile phone?

35:28.833 --> 35:29.832
I want all this immediately.

35:29.958 --> 35:30.790
Yes sir

35:31.041 --> 35:32.124
Johnny Wong just died.

35:37.291 --> 35:39.249
May, inform Phoenix

35:40.291 --> 35:41.540
and the welfare section.

35:41.833 --> 35:42.832
Tell them to send people to the hospital.

35:43.708 --> 35:44.332
How much more time?

35:46.208 --> 35:47.207
45 seconds.

36:15.708 --> 36:16.415
Hello?

36:17.083 --> 36:18.290
Commissioner Lau.

36:19.583 --> 36:20.457
How should I call you?

36:21.166 --> 36:23.624
Commissioner, are you well prepared?

36:24.291 --> 36:25.624
$93.2 million.

36:26.125 --> 36:27.374
I can only prepare it in Hong Kong dollars.

36:28.458 --> 36:29.915
Get it ready before 3:30.

36:30.208 --> 36:32.374
I'll tell you how to hand it over.

36:59.791 --> 37:00.582
Albert

37:01.250 --> 37:01.874
Yes?

37:02.125 --> 37:03.624
We shouldn't all stay
and use up our energy here.

37:04.375 --> 37:05.207
You sign off first.

37:06.083 --> 37:06.915
Lau.

37:09.583 --> 37:10.790
Let me go to the vault.

37:23.791 --> 37:26.582
Mr Luk sent this to me.
He wanted me to hand it to you.

37:27.083 --> 37:28.249
He said you know what it is.

37:56.291 --> 37:56.957
Mr Tsui,

38:00.083 --> 38:01.082
I have a few words for you.

38:37.791 --> 38:38.457
Lau.

38:44.208 --> 38:44.874
Hello?

38:45.458 --> 38:47.874
Do you have the cash with you, Commissioner?

38:48.041 --> 38:48.749
Yes.

38:49.375 --> 38:51.457
Let me tell you. Your calculation is wrong.

38:51.583 --> 38:52.957
I can't wait any longer. Listen.

38:53.125 --> 38:56.249
I want $33.33 million in cash.

38:56.458 --> 38:58.165
You have half an hour to prepare it.

38:58.541 --> 38:59.707
Also, don't bother to trace me.

38:59.916 --> 39:01.540
I'm at Chung On Street in Tsuen Wan.

39:05.291 --> 39:05.874
Hurry.

39:15.208 --> 39:17.374
After deducting $33 million,
around $60 million remains.

39:20.500 --> 39:22.457
Lau, just a few words.

39:26.041 --> 39:28.957
The vault's director reminded me
before I left that

39:29.166 --> 39:30.665
in case we don't use the whole sum,

39:31.000 --> 39:32.749
we can return what's unused
to the vault right away.

39:33.083 --> 39:34.290
He doesn't want to get in trouble.

39:36.916 --> 39:37.832
Use a dog van.

39:42.375 --> 39:44.290
Deliver the remaining sum
back to the vault by dog van.

39:44.958 --> 39:45.707
Be careful.

40:00.041 --> 40:01.124
What to do with this Lee guy?

40:01.666 --> 40:03.207
His life is more valuable
than these people together.

40:03.416 --> 40:04.499
Don't let him die.

40:15.291 --> 40:16.249
Change the location now.

40:24.208 --> 40:25.165
The cash is ready.

40:25.291 --> 40:25.957
How to hand it over?

40:26.291 --> 40:27.415
Come alone.

40:27.666 --> 40:28.499
Do you drive?

40:28.625 --> 40:29.207
Yes, I do.

40:38.500 --> 40:39.999
CQ, CQ

40:40.083 --> 40:40.832
Lau,

40:48.958 --> 40:50.374
I have deployed three teams to back you up.

41:17.416 --> 41:18.165
Plate number?

41:18.500 --> 41:20.290
KM 1 605, black

41:20.958 --> 41:21.749
Where are you now?

41:22.291 --> 41:23.499
Leaving the car park.

41:24.250 --> 41:26.832
Go to Arsenal Street,
turn left into Harcourt Road.

41:27.208 --> 41:28.207
Cross the harbour via
the Western Harbour Tunnel.

41:29.708 --> 41:31.249
Copy, Car 1 will wait at
the Western Harbour Tunnel entrance.

41:35.166 --> 41:37.249
Sorry, I've changed my mind.

41:38.041 --> 41:38.957
Get out of the car now.

41:50.583 --> 41:54.874
Commissioner, take the escalator
on your left to the footbridge.

41:55.875 --> 41:57.624
Shall we take a ferry?

42:15.333 --> 42:16.457
IFC is on Lau's left.

42:16.583 --> 42:17.540
Four Seasons Hotel in the front.

42:17.666 --> 42:19.124
Star Ferry Pier on his right.

42:23.208 --> 42:24.832
Vincent, counting on you now.

42:25.250 --> 42:27.624
Car 2 and Car 3, go to the Star Ferry.

42:28.208 --> 42:29.124
Stand by from left and right.

42:33.375 --> 42:35.582
At your pace, you should almost be there.

42:36.541 --> 42:38.207
Tell me what's in front of you.

42:38.375 --> 42:39.582
Pier 7 is in front of me.

42:40.416 --> 42:42.790
Piers 2 to 6 to outlying islands on my left.

42:50.083 --> 42:52.374
Turn left, go to Pier 6.

42:52.750 --> 42:53.874
Take the ferry to Lantau Island.

43:11.458 --> 43:12.540
Turn around.

43:12.958 --> 43:16.415
Take this ferry to Tsim Sha Tsui.

43:18.125 --> 43:19.124
Run Over.

43:20.625 --> 43:22.040
Lau turned round, Lau turned round.

43:22.125 --> 43:22.874
We're all exposed.

43:23.750 --> 43:24.624
Counter-tailing tactic?

43:25.583 --> 43:26.832
Let's take the Western Harbour Tunnel.

43:27.041 --> 43:27.915
Car 1 .

43:28.083 --> 43:29.874
Slow down at the Kowloon exit and wait for me.

44:06.750 --> 44:09.165
When did you last take a ferry,
Commissioner Lau?

44:09.291 --> 44:10.040
You keep talking to me.

44:11.375 --> 44:12.582
Aren't you worried we'll trace you?

44:13.083 --> 44:15.124
Then I'll call you back in five minutes.

44:15.250 --> 44:18.790
Before I go, a reminder for you:

44:19.083 --> 44:22.249
Keep an eye on yourself, not just the others.

44:22.375 --> 44:23.957
Your shoelaces have come untied.

44:44.541 --> 44:46.915
Albert, the phone signal
is very close to Lau's location.

44:50.708 --> 44:51.915
Team across the harbour on standby.

45:05.708 --> 45:06.832
Are you Mr Lau?

45:07.041 --> 45:07.624
Yes.

45:14.041 --> 45:14.707
Hello?

45:14.958 --> 45:17.915
Commissioner Lau. Four minutes behind schedule.

45:19.166 --> 45:19.874
Get in a taxi

45:19.958 --> 45:23.540
and go to the airport. Don't queue for a taxi.

45:26.458 --> 45:28.665
Mister, my shift is over. Take another one.

45:30.125 --> 45:31.540
Police, start the car.

45:44.208 --> 45:45.374
Received Lau's SMS.

45:45.875 --> 45:48.374
Taxi plate number Mother Alpha 8714.

45:48.750 --> 45:51.165
License No. 661 8, Leo Hui.

45:51.500 --> 45:54.082
Hey, wait a while. Coming soon.

45:54.375 --> 45:55.415
I picked up a difficult one.

45:55.500 --> 45:55.999
What can I do?

45:56.166 --> 45:58.749
Set up the mahjong table and wait for me.
Talk later.

46:07.083 --> 46:08.040
Where are you now?

46:09.208 --> 46:11.540
Route 5, West Kowloon Corridor.

46:12.166 --> 46:15.082
Don't go to the airport.
Go up the flyover to Tai Kok Tsui.

46:19.458 --> 46:21.957
Wait, driver. Turn right,
take the flyover to Tai Kok Tsui.

46:22.041 --> 46:24.165
First you said the airport
and now its Tai Kok Tsui.

46:24.375 --> 46:27.874
Sir, Are you having fun?
Can you think clearly first, sir?

46:28.666 --> 46:32.457
I guess both you
and the money bag are equipped with

46:32.583 --> 46:33.790
tracking devices, right?

46:33.916 --> 46:34.832
Have you ever been in the force?

46:35.958 --> 46:38.040
If you had, you would've had a bright future.

46:38.625 --> 46:42.165
I joined in 1 988, have we met before?

46:43.041 --> 46:45.124
I have absolutely no interest in the job.

46:45.791 --> 46:46.957
How are my colleagues with you?

46:48.833 --> 46:52.665
Stop! I said stop the car.

46:55.583 --> 46:56.457
Stop!

46:56.583 --> 46:58.332
Sir, my license can be revoked!

46:58.458 --> 46:59.040
Stop!

47:05.791 --> 47:08.124
Sir, what can I do? We can't stop here.

47:11.916 --> 47:12.582
What do you want?

47:12.833 --> 47:13.957
Look down from the bridge.

47:18.958 --> 47:20.082
You're following me.

47:20.541 --> 47:22.124
Aren't you concerned about your fellows?

47:22.250 --> 47:24.124
Don't you want to save them?

47:24.708 --> 47:28.165
I'll count down from three,
and you'll throw the money down.

47:29.083 --> 47:31.582
Three, two, one!

47:46.541 --> 47:47.540
Police! Freeze!

47:48.208 --> 47:49.165
Put down the money

47:56.166 --> 47:58.582
Vincent! Come up to help me.

48:11.458 --> 48:13.207
How about my taxi, sir?

48:13.333 --> 48:13.915
You just keep silent.

48:14.041 --> 48:14.749
What should I do?

48:17.083 --> 48:17.624
Run!

49:24.916 --> 49:28.874
Ah...My car, Sir! Ah...It hurts!

49:41.958 --> 49:42.582
Vincent

49:49.958 --> 49:54.290
Lack of practice. Less nimble.

49:59.291 --> 50:01.165
Albert, call an ambulance.

50:01.458 --> 50:02.957
Lau, we've been had.

50:03.333 --> 50:04.749
The money in the dog van was taken.

50:06.333 --> 50:07.665
Call an ambulance!

50:11.625 --> 50:12.582
Vincent

50:14.041 --> 50:15.957
Find where Lau is. Send the ambulance.

50:46.375 --> 50:47.040
Yes?

50:52.875 --> 50:53.457
Sir

50:58.958 --> 51:01.582
Sorry sir.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.207
You've worked so hard. Take a rest.

51:06.416 --> 51:07.165
Thank you sir.

51:09.000 --> 51:09.665
Lee.

51:10.416 --> 51:11.124
How is it?

51:11.583 --> 51:13.082
The Organised Crime team
is taking statements from colleagues.

51:14.791 --> 51:17.957
Calm the colleagues first.
It's been a tough day for everyone.

51:21.750 --> 51:22.624
Sir

51:27.375 --> 51:28.374
Sorry sir.

51:32.041 --> 51:34.207
Make a statement after dealing with your wound.

51:36.416 --> 51:38.832
Take a rest. Where's Lau?

51:38.958 --> 51:39.540
Over there.

51:44.375 --> 51:49.165
Vincent?

51:49.958 --> 51:51.374
Tell me!

51:51.458 --> 51:51.999
Mrs Tsui.

51:52.375 --> 51:52.957
Vincent?

51:54.500 --> 51:56.499
Where's Vincent?

51:57.041 --> 51:57.790
Oh...

51:59.208 --> 52:00.457
Vincent!

52:01.166 --> 52:02.082
Oh no.

52:02.416 --> 52:04.415
Bring Vincent to me!

52:16.625 --> 52:17.415
Lau.

52:33.333 --> 52:36.249
The Commissioner's flight
is delayed to tomorrow morning.

52:37.625 --> 52:41.124
Before he got on board,
he only knew there was one commander

52:41.250 --> 52:43.374
for operation Cold War: you.

52:44.625 --> 52:47.749
This key, you'd better return it
to him personally tomorrow.

52:57.958 --> 52:58.832
Sorry.

53:04.250 --> 53:05.457
Today was so strange!

53:06.958 --> 53:10.790
Everyone apologised to me once
I arrived in the hospital.

53:12.750 --> 53:16.457
I can accept their apologies, but not yours.

53:22.666 --> 53:24.415
Luckily, the four missing colleagues are back.

53:25.791 --> 53:27.082
Vincent's case is unfortunate.

53:27.833 --> 53:29.040
But we're not totally defeated.

53:32.125 --> 53:38.290
If I were in charge,
I'd be more radical than you..

54:11.666 --> 54:16.290
Lau.

54:19.750 --> 54:23.207
The vault's director William Ngai
has taken half a month of annual leave

54:23.625 --> 54:24.582
without saying where he'll go.

54:25.166 --> 54:27.040
I'll check with
Immigration Department tomorrow.

54:30.291 --> 54:33.457
It's already 1 o'clock.
How about I drive you home.

54:49.708 --> 54:51.957
Lau, we've arrived.

54:53.041 --> 54:56.207
Go home to sleep. I'll pick you up tomorrow.

55:00.875 --> 55:01.790
Vincent

55:44.791 --> 55:45.665
Excuse me, sir.

55:46.250 --> 55:47.707
I want a confidential briefing.

55:49.166 --> 55:51.957
I received a document this morning
from a sender signed "Informer".

55:53.208 --> 55:55.832
It's a complaint against current
Deputy Police Commissioner Sean Lau,

55:56.125 --> 55:58.749
for allegedly accepting advantages
and perverting the course of justice.

55:58.958 --> 56:00.624
The complaint refers to

56:00.750 --> 56:02.499
the Tai Kok Tsui flyover gunfight
seven days ago.

56:02.583 --> 56:03.874
The trickiest thing about it is that

56:04.416 --> 56:06.457
one of those in the EU van,

56:07.041 --> 56:08.999
was the son of Deputy Commissioner M.B. Lee.

56:09.500 --> 56:11.665
Police ranks of superintendent and above

56:11.750 --> 56:13.374
must all pass integrity checking.

56:13.583 --> 56:15.374
Billy, are you serious?

56:18.083 --> 56:20.165
For a month up to yesterday,

56:20.500 --> 56:23.665
at all the registered banks in Hong Kong,
all the counters

56:23.791 --> 56:25.790
received an amount of tracing paper

56:25.958 --> 56:29.957
totaling $31 9,500.

56:32.041 --> 56:34.582
I don't understand what you mean,

56:36.333 --> 56:37.207
Mr Chan.

56:37.333 --> 56:39.915
What I'm saying is that
we as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority

56:40.458 --> 56:41.749
never thought tracing paper prepared

56:41.958 --> 56:43.665
for law enforcement departments

56:43.750 --> 56:44.332
would be of any use.

56:44.833 --> 56:45.582
You make it sound like the money was lost

56:45.708 --> 56:47.915
because of us, Mr Chan

56:49.166 --> 56:51.082
Wait. Let me say something.

56:52.750 --> 56:55.832
Tracing paper, so-called traceable banknotes,

56:56.708 --> 56:58.915
hasn't worked well in tracking
down criminals at all.

56:59.416 --> 57:03.874
For the Monetary Authority
to prepare such money for us in future,

57:04.833 --> 57:05.957
we'd need to do further re-assessment.

57:08.208 --> 57:09.582
Sir, Independent
Commission Against Corruption officers.

57:09.708 --> 57:10.457
Mr Sean Lau,

57:11.541 --> 57:13.957
I'm ICAC Principal Investigation Officer
Billy Cheung.

57:14.291 --> 57:16.624
We suspect you violated the Prevention
of Bribery Ordinance, section 4.

57:16.750 --> 57:18.165
Please come with
us to assist in investigations.

57:18.416 --> 57:22.207
What do you mean?
Making an arrest at Police Headquarters,

57:22.333 --> 57:23.290
and it's the Deputy Commissioner?

57:29.958 --> 57:32.165
Mr Lau, please co-operate with us.

57:33.583 --> 57:34.665
Don't you know any rules?

57:35.958 --> 57:37.540
The people here are

57:37.625 --> 57:40.124
the top management
maintaining Hong Kong's safety.

57:41.291 --> 57:42.957
If you want to invite Mr Lau to your office,

57:43.708 --> 57:45.957
you must give at least half an hour's notice.

57:46.208 --> 57:49.457
Also, with such a big issue,
did you inform your boss?

57:50.541 --> 57:52.707
Half an hour? No problem.

57:52.875 --> 57:58.165
It's OK.

58:00.625 --> 58:03.290
Lee, I'll go with them.

58:33.833 --> 58:35.707
Sorry, Mr Lau. Kept you waiting so long.

58:37.041 --> 58:38.415
This is my assistant, W.M. Kwok.

58:41.583 --> 58:43.832
Be direct. Let's cut to the chase.

58:44.083 --> 58:44.790
Sure.

58:45.666 --> 58:46.707
We received a complaint against you.

58:47.333 --> 58:49.540
That's why we invited
you here to get more information.

58:49.875 --> 58:52.540
The force has an operation named Cold War.

58:54.041 --> 58:56.124
Judging by your experience and instinct,

58:57.208 --> 58:58.915
how easy would it be

58:59.416 --> 59:00.665
to hijack

59:00.791 --> 59:04.332
an EU van?

59:05.208 --> 59:07.790
Didn't you just say to be direct?

59:08.250 --> 59:10.624
Frankly, given today's advanced technology,

59:11.416 --> 59:15.332
making an EU van vanish is almost impossible.

59:16.041 --> 59:17.290
Unless it's an inside job.

59:19.083 --> 59:23.290
Do you think there's mole
in the Police Force, Mr Lau?

59:24.875 --> 59:26.665
After the Cold War operation,

59:27.333 --> 59:28.957
our Internal Affairs section opened a file

59:30.000 --> 59:32.582
for integrity checking
on each person in the van.

59:33.458 --> 59:37.374
"Before the report is completed,
I have no comment."

59:37.875 --> 59:41.124
Before operation Cold War,
because the Commissioner was out of town,

59:41.250 --> 59:42.540
M.B. Lee was initially

59:42.833 --> 59:44.332
the Acting Commissioner.

59:44.625 --> 59:45.999
But when Cold War went into action,

59:46.125 --> 59:48.999
you took over from him.

59:49.833 --> 59:53.540
That means you weren't originally

59:54.458 --> 59:56.249
the chief commander
of operation Cold War, right?

59:56.375 --> 59:56.957
That's correct.

59:57.083 --> 59:59.290
So may I know what criteria
the Police Force uses

59:59.416 --> 01:00:00.874
to assign the chief commander for an operation?

01:00:01.416 --> 01:00:03.915
And what are the criteria
for changing a chief commander?

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.082
Of course, the role of
Acting Commissioner is very important.

01:00:07.208 --> 01:00:09.082
What's the mechanism for assigning it?

01:00:09.291 --> 01:00:11.832
The answers are all in
the Police Force Ordinance.

01:00:12.833 --> 01:00:15.665
You can download it online
and find out yourself.

01:00:17.333 --> 01:00:19.040
This operation's report is

01:00:19.166 --> 01:00:21.082
very different from previous reports.

01:00:21.166 --> 01:00:22.457
That's why we asked you to come here, Mr Lau.

01:00:24.166 --> 01:00:25.082
Given that there's no record

01:00:25.208 --> 01:00:26.207
about changing the operation commander,

01:00:26.333 --> 01:00:27.457
it's already a big issue!

01:00:30.833 --> 01:00:34.707
Do you know the difference
between a report and a log sheet?

01:00:39.375 --> 01:00:42.582
As the hijackers requested,
the force took the ransom from the vault.

01:00:43.041 --> 01:00:46.165
The hijackers requested a new number
and the total sum wasn't used up.

01:00:46.583 --> 01:00:49.207
Under legal principles,
the remaining money should've been classed

01:00:49.291 --> 01:00:50.540
as evidence and stored in the evidence room.

01:00:50.875 --> 01:00:53.290
But why was it sent back to the vault
on the same day

01:00:53.416 --> 01:00:55.874
with minimum security instead?

01:01:06.791 --> 01:01:08.499
After Mr Lee surrendered his power,

01:01:09.125 --> 01:01:11.582
you wrote a cheque for $93.2 million

01:01:11.833 --> 01:01:15.582
in the name of Acting Police Commissioner.

01:01:17.083 --> 01:01:19.957
Mr Lau, on December 8,

01:01:20.125 --> 01:01:21.540
you were actually

01:01:22.708 --> 01:01:25.207
the most powerful person in Hong Kong

01:01:25.291 --> 01:01:26.165
for two hours that afternoon.

01:01:28.125 --> 01:01:29.249
Your every decision

01:01:29.791 --> 01:01:32.290
could have affected Hong Kong's security.

01:01:33.416 --> 01:01:37.624
Whatever my position is,
I always make the security of citizens

01:01:38.541 --> 01:01:41.040
the top priority in every decision.

01:01:41.666 --> 01:01:42.874
We're both in law enforcement.

01:01:44.291 --> 01:01:46.332
Do you remember one lesson
in the criminology course

01:01:46.791 --> 01:01:48.665
covered Stockholm Syndrome?

01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:51.540
Since you said we're both working
for law enforcement,

01:01:51.958 --> 01:01:54.582
why do you keep beating around the bush?

01:01:54.958 --> 01:01:58.457
Simply tell me what I've done wrong.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.040
Mr Lau, have you seen this document?

01:02:11.791 --> 01:02:12.457
No.

01:02:12.833 --> 01:02:15.332
Regarding this document,
we sent a letter to the Security Bureau.

01:02:15.625 --> 01:02:17.540
But they in turn asked us how we got it.

01:02:17.916 --> 01:02:21.040
We found your fingerprints on this document.

01:02:21.875 --> 01:02:23.165
I need legal advice.

01:02:23.416 --> 01:02:24.665
We got permission from

01:02:24.791 --> 01:02:26.290
the Secretary for Justice to follow

01:02:26.416 --> 01:02:27.249
all your phone calls.

01:02:27.958 --> 01:02:29.415
We have sufficient criminal

01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:30.790
evidence on you.

01:02:32.666 --> 01:02:36.499
Tell me where's the $59 million

01:02:36.583 --> 01:02:37.999
in public money right now.

01:02:38.250 --> 01:02:41.582
Tell me, Mr Lau.

01:02:59.166 --> 01:03:00.874
Do you have a laptop computer in your office?

01:03:03.541 --> 01:03:05.415
You said you have all the evidence.

01:03:06.625 --> 01:03:08.207
Show it to me now!

01:03:10.958 --> 01:03:14.749
If not, I'll give you time to buy a computer.

01:03:19.833 --> 01:03:23.374
Also, can I call my lawyer?

01:03:31.666 --> 01:03:32.290
Speaking.

01:03:32.416 --> 01:03:34.290
If you can talk now, cough once.

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:38.207
[Cough.]

01:03:38.291 --> 01:03:41.457
May, go downstairs
to see Phoenix in the PR section.

01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:42.540
Ask if

01:03:43.041 --> 01:03:44.915
she has looked up the person
I asked her to check.

01:03:45.083 --> 01:03:47.624
Don't do it right now. You know what I mean.

01:03:49.166 --> 01:03:49.790
Yes.

01:03:53.208 --> 01:03:53.957
Mr Ngai.

01:03:54.041 --> 01:03:54.582
Mr Lau.

01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:55.457
Sit down.

01:03:58.666 --> 01:04:00.415
Sorry to ask you to meet
in such a hurry, Mr Ngai.

01:04:02.291 --> 01:04:04.499
I followed the Hong Kong news in Australia too.

01:04:05.250 --> 01:04:07.165
Never thought such
a big incident happened that day.

01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:08.540
Can you do me a favour?

01:04:09.958 --> 01:04:11.499
On December 8,

01:04:12.666 --> 01:04:14.249
did you ask my colleague Mr Tsui...

01:04:14.458 --> 01:04:15.207
Mr Tsui?

01:04:15.416 --> 01:04:16.749
... to return money to the vault

01:04:17.708 --> 01:04:19.165
as soon as possible if it wasn't used up?

01:04:21.583 --> 01:04:22.624
No, I didn't.

01:04:34.416 --> 01:04:37.499
Mr Ngai, if you don't mind,
can my colleague go to your office

01:04:37.708 --> 01:04:40.499
to take a statement from you tomorrow at noon?

01:04:41.166 --> 01:04:41.915
No problem.

01:04:42.958 --> 01:04:43.665
Thank you.

01:05:08.666 --> 01:05:11.582
Nicole speaking. OK.

01:05:12.416 --> 01:05:15.749
Billy, the Kowloon Bay vault's director
William Ngai just died.

01:05:16.083 --> 01:05:16.957
It's a car bomb.

01:05:25.875 --> 01:05:26.707
Looking for me?

01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:32.957
Colleagues are dealing with Vincent's funeral.

01:05:36.666 --> 01:05:37.540
For me?

01:05:41.166 --> 01:05:42.790
He lost a lot of money in the past half year.

01:05:43.041 --> 01:05:46.415
His apartment was mortgaged
to the bank three months ago.

01:06:49.625 --> 01:06:50.915
Did you eat?

01:06:52.875 --> 01:06:54.582
Let me cook noodles for you.

01:07:29.916 --> 01:07:31.165
I went to see Janet this afternoon.

01:07:34.208 --> 01:07:34.915
How is she?

01:07:35.708 --> 01:07:37.915
Vincent still has a lot of things to settle.

01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:39.874
I should go over to help her these days.

01:07:42.250 --> 01:07:43.790
Have you ever been betrayed by your friend?

01:07:48.833 --> 01:07:51.540
Billy, can you tell me
how you got hold of this CD-ROM?

01:07:51.958 --> 01:07:53.249
I can't at the moment.

01:07:53.375 --> 01:07:56.707
The contents are confidential
to the topmost level of the Police Force.

01:07:56.833 --> 01:07:58.749
with the highest confidentiality.

01:07:58.875 --> 01:08:00.457
There's no way a normal informant

01:08:00.583 --> 01:08:01.790
could obtain it.

01:08:02.208 --> 01:08:04.082
If the content inside is true,

01:08:04.416 --> 01:08:06.124
it may be beyond our power
to investigate further.

01:08:06.291 --> 01:08:08.082
But the informer seems familiar
with the police,

01:08:08.208 --> 01:08:10.707
the ICAC and the law.

01:08:10.916 --> 01:08:13.040
We are now the only people

01:08:13.125 --> 01:08:13.790
who can find out
the mastermind behind Cold War.

01:08:13.875 --> 01:08:16.290
We and the informer are in the same boat now.

01:08:16.666 --> 01:08:17.457
We can't return.

01:08:18.791 --> 01:08:20.957
I know you always want to go back
to the accountability bureau, right?

01:08:21.125 --> 01:08:24.082
Billy, I've thought of it.
But this case is too complicated.

01:08:24.207 --> 01:08:25.457
This is the only chance.

01:08:25.875 --> 01:08:28.499
It could be the Watergate of our times.

01:08:30.625 --> 01:08:32.832
OK. I'll give you three days.

01:08:32.957 --> 01:08:33.457
Three days.

01:08:33.582 --> 01:08:34.249
Thank you, sir.

01:08:51.457 --> 01:08:53.207
According to sources,

01:08:53.375 --> 01:08:55.540
Deputy Police Commissioner Sean Lau

01:08:55.625 --> 01:08:58.249
was arrested by the ICAC yesterday morning.

01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:08.499
Hello, I...

01:09:12.166 --> 01:09:12.957
Excuse me.

01:09:13.082 --> 01:09:15.207
If you keep throwing in questions like this,
we won't answer any questions.

01:09:15.291 --> 01:09:16.249
Let the Chinese media go first.

01:09:17.375 --> 01:09:19.665
Mr Luk, is Sean Lau being suspended now?

01:09:19.832 --> 01:09:21.499
He's taking leave for personal reasons.

01:09:21.541 --> 01:09:22.749
The opinion of the Police Force
is very low this year.

01:09:22.875 --> 01:09:24.290
Now the Deputy Police Commissioner
is even arrested by the ICAC.

01:09:24.416 --> 01:09:26.415
Should anyone in the accountability
bureau take responsibility?

01:09:27.207 --> 01:09:27.915
This question,

01:09:27.957 --> 01:09:28.832
Let's discuss it next time.

01:09:28.875 --> 01:09:30.999
Mr Luk, you've not once said in public that

01:09:31.125 --> 01:09:32.915
you support Sean Lau to be
the next Police Commissioner.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:33.707
Did the ICAC operation

01:09:33.791 --> 01:09:35.332
mess up your deployment?

01:09:35.416 --> 01:09:35.790
I...

01:09:35.875 --> 01:09:37.207
Secretary Luk, what do you think about

01:09:37.291 --> 01:09:38.040
a high-ranking police official

01:09:38.166 --> 01:09:39.499
being arrested by the ICAC?

01:09:39.582 --> 01:09:41.374
Do you think Sean Lau is guilty of bribery?

01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:42.790
Do you think you've picked the wrong person?

01:09:42.916 --> 01:09:43.874
Would you take the blame and resign?

01:09:44.041 --> 01:09:45.332
Mr Luk, before taking action,

01:09:45.457 --> 01:09:47.374
did the ICAC inform the Security Bureau?

01:09:55.791 --> 01:09:57.332
I said it clearly:

01:09:57.625 --> 01:09:58.957
One at a time.

01:10:04.708 --> 01:10:07.207
Let me answer your questions all together.

01:10:08.791 --> 01:10:12.040
Deputy Commissioner Mr Lau
wasn't arrested by the ICAC.

01:10:12.458 --> 01:10:14.415
He's taking leave on personal grounds.

01:10:15.916 --> 01:10:18.957
I personally recognise his integrity
and capability very much.

01:10:20.625 --> 01:10:23.040
Another thing I want to clarify again is that

01:10:23.375 --> 01:10:25.707
Hong Kong is an advanced city
under common law jurisdiction.

01:10:26.791 --> 01:10:29.124
The ICAC doesn't need to report to me

01:10:29.208 --> 01:10:30.999
before taking action.

01:10:34.291 --> 01:10:35.457
I understand.

01:10:36.291 --> 01:10:37.624
Even though you're free

01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:39.499
to ask any questions,

01:10:41.208 --> 01:10:43.874
please familiarise yourself with Hong Kong law

01:10:43.958 --> 01:10:46.499
and the spirit of the rule of law
before you ask,

01:10:47.708 --> 01:10:50.707
because this is the core value that made

01:10:51.208 --> 01:10:53.040
Hong Kong an international financial centre

01:10:53.625 --> 01:10:56.540
and Asia's safest city.

01:11:03.208 --> 01:11:04.665
M.B. Lee was a constable.

01:11:04.958 --> 01:11:06.957
Sean Lau rose from admin.

01:11:07.291 --> 01:11:08.832
Lau sir, 44 years old,

01:11:09.541 --> 01:11:12.457
is the youngest Deputy Commissioner
since the handover.

01:11:12.791 --> 01:11:15.040
Lee will be turning 51 next week.

01:11:15.166 --> 01:11:17.665
Commissioner Tsang
will retire in two and a half years.

01:11:17.875 --> 01:11:20.124
But so far, no one knows
who will be the successor,

01:11:20.708 --> 01:11:21.832
even within the force.

01:11:22.416 --> 01:11:23.832
Lee is hawkish and has always been popular

01:11:24.250 --> 01:11:26.749
among front-line officers,

01:11:27.166 --> 01:11:28.499
especially Criminal Investigation Department
detectives.

01:11:28.958 --> 01:11:31.707
He looks like the successor
under normal practice.

01:11:31.916 --> 01:11:34.040
But we were tipped off
by senior government sources that

01:11:35.083 --> 01:11:37.915
their ideal choice is actually Sean Lau.

01:11:38.916 --> 01:11:40.374
Because under his management for four years,

01:11:40.750 --> 01:11:43.249
the force has been revamped very well.

01:11:43.666 --> 01:11:46.207
If no critical mistakes happen
in the force management

01:11:46.333 --> 01:11:47.749
in these few months,

01:11:47.916 --> 01:11:49.457
M.B. Lee would probably be urged to stay

01:11:49.583 --> 01:11:52.165
as Operations Deputy Police Commissioner
and then retire.

01:11:52.375 --> 01:11:53.665
Then Sean Lau could become

01:11:54.708 --> 01:11:56.374
Hong Kong's youngest

01:11:56.541 --> 01:11:58.290
Police Commissioner ever.

01:11:58.375 --> 01:12:00.290
Billy, do you think Lee

01:12:00.375 --> 01:12:02.082
wanted to strike out Sean Lau

01:12:02.250 --> 01:12:03.040
in case Lau would threaten his prospects?

01:12:03.333 --> 01:12:06.707
If you're making assumptions,
you might as well be bold.

01:12:19.375 --> 01:12:21.082
Nicole, call the government laboratory.

01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:30.082
Three days ago, I received critical info

01:12:30.208 --> 01:12:31.332
from the informer.

01:12:31.875 --> 01:12:33.790
Mr Mak has contacted the Police Commissioner

01:12:33.958 --> 01:12:36.457
and they initially believed
the information is reliable.

01:12:36.958 --> 01:12:39.582
Tomorrow, we'll invite
Deputy Police Commissioner M.B. Lee here.

01:12:40.166 --> 01:12:43.040
We heard Lee is far
more sophisticated than Sean Lau.

01:12:43.250 --> 01:12:44.290
We have to be alert.

01:12:47.416 --> 01:12:49.374
Mr Lee, we brought you here so early,

01:12:49.958 --> 01:12:51.749
so hopefully it wouldn't scare you
and your family.

01:12:54.083 --> 01:12:56.624
Can you recall the names in this document?

01:12:57.291 --> 01:12:58.040
No.

01:12:58.166 --> 01:12:58.957
An EU van

01:12:59.166 --> 01:12:59.915
Not including minor players,

01:13:00.208 --> 01:13:02.124
there'd be a mole
who knows the operation details,

01:13:02.666 --> 01:13:04.374
an IT person who set up the whole system,

01:13:04.875 --> 01:13:06.249
your contact person,

01:13:06.833 --> 01:13:09.082
and of course a member in the EU van.

01:13:10.166 --> 01:13:12.207
At least four people were needed

01:13:12.333 --> 01:13:14.165
to extort the Hong Kong Police Force.

01:13:14.416 --> 01:13:15.915
Even if you had an IT person as the fall guy

01:13:16.125 --> 01:13:16.874
and made the lost guns surface,

01:13:17.791 --> 01:13:20.374
the mole and the member
in the EU van would remain unknown.

01:13:21.041 --> 01:13:22.290
I totally don't know what you mean.

01:13:22.833 --> 01:13:26.415
In 1 995, a perfect undercover plan

01:13:26.583 --> 01:13:29.665
successfully broke up a triad gang.

01:13:29.958 --> 01:13:31.082
The head of the Organised Crime bureau then

01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:32.415
was M.B. Lee.

01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:35.874
After the job, due to safety,

01:13:36.375 --> 01:13:38.040
you vouched for the officers to join

01:13:38.125 --> 01:13:40.124
the last batch in the colonial government's
Identity Renewal Programme.

01:13:40.458 --> 01:13:41.915
They were even allowed to change names legally

01:13:42.041 --> 01:13:44.374
and obtained right of abode in South Africa.

01:13:44.958 --> 01:13:47.999
The file number of the program is ND1 57.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.457
You sound more like a cop than an ICAC officer.

01:13:52.916 --> 01:13:54.874
Even the vault's director was killed by you.

01:13:55.416 --> 01:13:58.040
Lots of current and old colleagues
even helped you stage a big show

01:13:58.333 --> 01:14:01.915
to clear Vincent Tsui
and kick out Sean Lau, right?

01:14:02.583 --> 01:14:04.207
You brought me here so early

01:14:06.208 --> 01:14:07.832
just to hear a story you made up.

01:14:08.708 --> 01:14:10.957
If there's nothing more, I have to go.

01:14:12.583 --> 01:14:16.124
Mr Lee, your planning
capability is really strong.

01:14:16.875 --> 01:14:19.790
Sean Lau has an impeccable resume
plus a strong support team,

01:14:20.125 --> 01:14:22.832
but all this was wiped out
by a so-called Cold War operation.

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:25.207
According to records, your father Lee Shu-tang

01:14:25.375 --> 01:14:27.207
was the highest-ranking
Chinese Police Superintendent

01:14:27.416 --> 01:14:29.374
and your son Joe Lee, with a high IQ at 1 92,

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:30.499
graduated with the Silver Whistle Award.

01:14:31.208 --> 01:14:33.582
The Lee family has three honorable generations.

01:14:33.708 --> 01:14:34.665
Congratulations, Mr Lee.

01:14:35.208 --> 01:14:36.874
You must be the next Police Commissioner.

01:14:39.291 --> 01:14:41.207
Your imagination is too much.

01:14:41.541 --> 01:14:42.415
It's nothing to do with imagination.

01:14:43.333 --> 01:14:45.540
Your old colleague Yeung Chi-on
is sitting in the next room.

01:14:46.125 --> 01:14:48.790
Do you want me to bring him here for a reunion?

01:14:54.583 --> 01:14:57.499
Kid, don't trick me.

01:14:58.458 --> 01:15:00.124
I can bet on my life that

01:15:01.166 --> 01:15:03.040
there's no one except your boss
in the next room.

01:15:07.791 --> 01:15:09.540
Just based on such a biased analysis,

01:15:10.125 --> 01:15:12.165
without any logical reasoning,

01:15:12.416 --> 01:15:15.457
you dare to bring in the two
Deputy Police Commissioners for questioning

01:15:15.875 --> 01:15:19.374
and waste their valuable time.
Isn't it exciting?

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:26.290
Seize the hidden mastermind,
smash the big conspiracy in the Police Force.

01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:28.832
Don't you feel proud?

01:15:30.708 --> 01:15:32.124
When you've reached my position,

01:15:32.666 --> 01:15:34.499
you would understand.

01:15:37.708 --> 01:15:41.540
Even the Commissioner
would be amazed by my connections.

01:15:42.375 --> 01:15:43.332
What did you think

01:15:44.041 --> 01:15:46.290
you'd gain from questioning me?

01:15:48.583 --> 01:15:52.290
You assumed that one
of the Deputy Commissioners is the mole.

01:15:53.083 --> 01:15:56.165
Either Sean Lau wanted to take the ransom money

01:15:56.958 --> 01:16:00.040
or I trapped him to get a promotion.

01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:09.040
I've been serving in the force for 30 years,

01:16:09.708 --> 01:16:12.790
have many friends and have enemies too.

01:16:13.791 --> 01:16:15.624
In these 30 years, I learned one thing:

01:16:16.750 --> 01:16:17.832
no matter what organisation,

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:20.249
department or position you're in,

01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:22.082
you first need to learn

01:16:23.166 --> 01:16:25.040
the rules of the game,

01:16:25.708 --> 01:16:28.207
whether they're written or unspoken.

01:16:29.208 --> 01:16:31.915
But many people failed to and died
before they learned them.

01:16:32.458 --> 01:16:33.457
Do you know why?

01:16:34.791 --> 01:16:35.874
Because they try to act smart.

01:16:36.250 --> 01:16:37.124
Second step,

01:16:38.208 --> 01:16:40.957
find the boundary in the game

01:16:42.125 --> 01:16:43.790
and don't

01:16:44.416 --> 01:16:46.457
overstep it.

01:16:47.208 --> 01:16:49.165
Only then can you barely survive.

01:16:51.333 --> 01:16:54.665
Can a city be run without the ICAC

01:16:55.291 --> 01:16:56.749
or without the police?

01:17:00.208 --> 01:17:05.374
Also, you two are still green. Watch out!

01:17:06.541 --> 01:17:10.124
Your boss is not a good person.

01:17:13.083 --> 01:17:13.832
Lee.

01:17:13.958 --> 01:17:14.874
Mak.

01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:16.165
This is the first time

01:17:16.291 --> 01:17:17.540
you've visited us after our relocation.

01:17:17.875 --> 01:17:18.790
Why didn't you tell me you'd dropped by?

01:17:19.333 --> 01:17:21.332
I was invited by the ICAC today

01:17:21.416 --> 01:17:23.332
to help in an investigation.

01:17:24.083 --> 01:17:25.207
According to Hong Kong law,

01:17:25.791 --> 01:17:28.582
the ICAC can detain me for 48 hours

01:17:28.666 --> 01:17:29.832
without complete evidence.

01:17:31.291 --> 01:17:32.874
I decided to stay here for a night.

01:17:33.208 --> 01:17:34.624
I'll give you two days

01:17:35.208 --> 01:17:36.082
and hope you can find

01:17:36.166 --> 01:17:37.582
sufficient evidence by all means

01:17:37.708 --> 01:17:39.374
to allow you to question me again.

01:17:39.708 --> 01:17:40.707
Don't be angry.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.165
You're the Deputy Police Commissioner.

01:17:42.541 --> 01:17:45.249
We just want to help the force
to clean out the black marks.

01:17:45.375 --> 01:17:46.332
Come on. Come over to my office.

01:17:47.208 --> 01:17:48.624
You now know how to play the game, right?

01:18:10.416 --> 01:18:10.874
Mr Lee.

01:18:10.958 --> 01:18:11.957
Mr Lau wants to see you.

01:19:19.666 --> 01:19:20.374
Looking for me?

01:19:27.250 --> 01:19:28.415
Winston Churchill said

01:19:28.833 --> 01:19:30.790
all wars are unnecessary.

01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:33.499
What do you mean?

01:19:40.750 --> 01:19:42.749
The report from
the government laboratory came in.

01:19:42.875 --> 01:19:45.624
It's confirmed that the bomb
in William Ngai's car

01:19:45.708 --> 01:19:46.499
was made with black powder.

01:19:47.125 --> 01:19:49.499
Sulphur, charcoal and potassium nitrate?

01:19:51.958 --> 01:19:53.915
Those are the main ingredients
for black powder.

01:19:54.166 --> 01:19:54.915
Excuse me.

01:19:55.250 --> 01:19:56.207
What is black powder?

01:19:56.583 --> 01:19:58.249
Black powder is a low-level explosive

01:19:58.708 --> 01:20:00.165
used mainly in fireworks.

01:20:00.958 --> 01:20:02.124
Don't take it lightly.

01:20:02.333 --> 01:20:04.290
Within 4,000 square feet,
it can still kill people.

01:20:04.625 --> 01:20:05.665
They wanted to push the blame onto Vincent

01:20:05.791 --> 01:20:07.290
and the vault's director

01:20:08.416 --> 01:20:10.124
with their deaths.

01:20:10.583 --> 01:20:12.332
The hijacking's mastermind is obviously

01:20:13.583 --> 01:20:14.915
from inside the force.

01:20:18.750 --> 01:20:20.082
No matter whether any of us

01:20:20.166 --> 01:20:21.915
continue investigating under Cold War,

01:20:22.958 --> 01:20:24.207
they'd certainly know about it.

01:20:25.875 --> 01:20:28.082
If they don't do anything
more or simply hide away,

01:20:29.083 --> 01:20:33.749
we'll never crack the case.

01:20:34.166 --> 01:20:35.957
Mr Mak, the ICAC is the only

01:20:36.083 --> 01:20:38.415
law enforcement body reporting
directly to the Chief Executive.

01:20:38.583 --> 01:20:39.957
Even the Security Bureau
has no authority over it.

01:20:40.125 --> 01:20:42.332
According to the structure,
the ICAC doesn't need to report to me

01:20:42.416 --> 01:20:43.957
before their operations.

01:20:45.541 --> 01:20:46.957
Trust your own judgment.

01:20:47.375 --> 01:20:49.957
Extreme times require extreme measures.

01:20:50.791 --> 01:20:53.332
I think the informer wants to use the ICAC

01:20:53.458 --> 01:20:54.332
to dig out the criminals.

01:21:00.916 --> 01:21:01.582
Hello?

01:21:02.833 --> 01:21:04.290
Are you the informer?

01:21:04.416 --> 01:21:06.374
If Lau didn't ask us to help,

01:21:06.583 --> 01:21:08.290
he could be the one being kicked out.

01:21:14.083 --> 01:21:18.540
44 buildings in Hong Kong
can release fireworks.

01:21:18.916 --> 01:21:20.915
But only 20 people hold black powder licenses.

01:21:21.333 --> 01:21:22.749
They're responsible for the firework shows.

01:21:23.250 --> 01:21:25.582
We checked all the firework technicians
at these 44 buildings

01:21:26.083 --> 01:21:27.290
and have targeted three of them.

01:21:27.833 --> 01:21:29.749
If we can find the bomber,

01:21:29.833 --> 01:21:31.499
we can then find the hijackers.

01:21:31.875 --> 01:21:33.499
The autopsy report for Johnny Wong said

01:21:34.541 --> 01:21:38.165
his whole body, including hair and nails,

01:21:38.708 --> 01:21:40.957
showed ferric oxide residues,
plus soil from the environment.

01:21:41.208 --> 01:21:42.957
According to statements
from the other four EU van members,

01:21:43.333 --> 01:21:44.874
all said they'd been kept at

01:21:45.625 --> 01:21:46.790
a scrap yard.

01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:49.499
This matched with the report.

01:21:51.625 --> 01:21:53.582
But I still have some reservations.

01:21:54.666 --> 01:21:57.707
Three days ago,
I asked the government laboratory

01:21:58.208 --> 01:22:00.415
to conduct further comparison
for the other four officers' clothing.

01:22:01.083 --> 01:22:02.624
Among the four van officers,

01:22:02.916 --> 01:22:05.790
three of them only had
one type of environmental element,

01:22:06.583 --> 01:22:09.290
but one of them had more than one.

01:22:10.833 --> 01:22:12.040
The only explanation is that

01:22:12.750 --> 01:22:17.874
this person had been
to the same place more than once.

01:22:18.333 --> 01:22:20.165
Do you remember there was a typhoon
in Hong Kong last month?

01:22:20.833 --> 01:22:23.082
Wind and rain diluted the soil.

01:22:26.208 --> 01:22:29.499
Nature became our time witness.

01:22:30.166 --> 01:22:33.249
The more careful a person is,
the more preparation he'd carry out.

01:22:34.916 --> 01:22:37.124
The hijack video
needed to be recorded in advance

01:22:37.666 --> 01:22:40.790
to have enough time to make sure
all the background information

01:22:40.916 --> 01:22:41.957
could be cleared.

01:22:42.625 --> 01:22:46.082
Although he has been very careful,

01:22:48.041 --> 01:22:51.249
the facts are always the most precise.

01:22:54.041 --> 01:22:57.082
According to sources,
when a firework is assembled on a roof,

01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:59.832
it's as dangerous as an explosives depot.

01:23:00.541 --> 01:23:01.707
Be careful, everybody!

01:23:02.125 --> 01:23:04.415
Killing the vault's director

01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:09.249
and leaving traces of black powder:
the clue is too obvious.

01:23:09.375 --> 01:23:10.665
The only logical explanation is that

01:23:10.833 --> 01:23:12.082
the mole

01:23:12.250 --> 01:23:13.790
who hijacked the EU van

01:23:14.375 --> 01:23:16.749
started to clear away witnesses
with outside help.

01:23:16.958 --> 01:23:18.457
He'd rather betray outsiders who helped him,

01:23:18.583 --> 01:23:19.915
and not colleagues inside the force.

01:23:19.916 --> 01:23:20.374
Bun.

01:23:20.458 --> 01:23:21.249
See you in the gondola.

01:23:23.458 --> 01:23:25.707
It's Team B. We've arrived at the south roof.

01:23:33.416 --> 01:23:34.124
Are you Albert Kwong?

01:23:34.291 --> 01:23:34.915
Speaking.

01:23:35.291 --> 01:23:37.040
Remember Chan Bun, who was
at Organised Crime and Triad Bureau?

01:23:39.791 --> 01:23:43.040
I want to be a witness in return
for immunity. I have things to say.

01:23:44.125 --> 01:23:45.582
See me on the roof now.

01:23:46.125 --> 01:23:48.332
OK. Wait for me.

01:23:52.666 --> 01:23:53.874
Michael...Michael

01:24:01.875 --> 01:24:06.665
Michael... Get Michael
and tell him to answer me.

01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:07.374
Yes sir

01:25:12.625 --> 01:25:13.457
Go, go, go.

01:25:52.333 --> 01:25:53.249
I'm Albert.

01:26:11.916 --> 01:26:14.249
Long time, no see. You'd been doing very well,
Superintendent Kwong.

01:26:25.250 --> 01:26:26.207
How long have you been back?

01:26:29.250 --> 01:26:30.582
I only want to know who else is involved.

01:26:30.958 --> 01:26:32.832
I'll only tell you
if the policemen downstairs back off.

01:26:37.333 --> 01:26:40.415
Calm down and put down the gun.

01:26:40.916 --> 01:26:42.332
How many are hurt below us?

01:26:42.833 --> 01:26:43.749
You tell me to put the gun down?

01:26:43.875 --> 01:26:44.582
Michael

01:26:52.875 --> 01:26:54.040
Give me some time.

01:26:55.041 --> 01:26:56.290
I'll be able to settle it.

01:26:56.541 --> 01:26:57.665
I can ensure your safety.

01:27:00.083 --> 01:27:04.332
Why did you betray me?

01:27:08.708 --> 01:27:10.165
Michael, why did you betray me?

01:27:27.958 --> 01:27:28.999
Go to hell!

01:28:04.375 --> 01:28:05.165
Dad.

01:28:05.541 --> 01:28:06.999
It's so late. Why aren't you asleep yet?

01:28:07.541 --> 01:28:08.874
Lau has something for you.

01:28:38.833 --> 01:28:40.249
What an oversight!

01:28:40.583 --> 01:28:41.582
Why?

01:28:49.666 --> 01:28:52.790
Actually, many seniors are on your side.

01:28:53.791 --> 01:28:57.165
Not only me but many people
beyond your imagination.

01:28:57.666 --> 01:28:59.332
They've been helping me all along.

01:28:59.541 --> 01:29:02.207
How about Vincent? Johnny Wong?

01:29:02.958 --> 01:29:05.582
They're policemen too. They have families.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.665
The first day in the academy,
the instructor helped clear my mind.

01:29:09.166 --> 01:29:09.790
He said my work

01:29:09.833 --> 01:29:11.540
would add a degree of danger to my life.

01:29:11.875 --> 01:29:14.249
This is part of the cost of fighting
for our rights and interests.

01:29:14.541 --> 01:29:15.874
I don't see any problem with it.

01:29:20.541 --> 01:29:22.665
Have you forgotten
what I've been teaching you all along?

01:29:23.041 --> 01:29:25.290
I haven't forgotten what you taught me,

01:29:25.833 --> 01:29:26.957
but times have changed.

01:29:27.875 --> 01:29:29.582
No one acknowledges you for helping people.

01:29:30.416 --> 01:29:33.582
If you let other people get promoted,
even God won't help you.

01:29:34.541 --> 01:29:36.082
I never knew you'd already gone so far.

01:29:37.125 --> 01:29:38.540
I want to ask you a question.

01:29:39.583 --> 01:29:41.832
If you were me, what would you do?

01:29:44.250 --> 01:29:45.040
I...

01:29:46.833 --> 01:29:48.499
I won't turn myself in.

01:29:49.083 --> 01:29:50.249
I won't go to jail.

01:29:51.166 --> 01:29:52.332
If I were you,

01:29:55.500 --> 01:29:56.915
I'd let your son go!

01:29:57.041 --> 01:29:57.915
Why are you so confident about it?

01:29:58.833 --> 01:30:00.290
Because I'm your only son.

01:30:26.583 --> 01:30:29.582
Since Sean Lau's in charge,
all he knows is how to reduce expenses

01:30:29.666 --> 01:30:32.499
to make the accounts look nice
and please the bosses.

01:30:32.791 --> 01:30:34.790
You know how low morale is at the front line?

01:30:34.958 --> 01:30:36.790
The present Commissioner is disappointing us.

01:30:37.041 --> 01:30:37.957
I won't let someone like him

01:30:38.083 --> 01:30:39.957
take the Commissioner post again.

01:30:40.833 --> 01:30:41.499
Dad,

01:30:42.208 --> 01:30:43.749
many colleagues support you.

01:30:44.458 --> 01:30:47.207
We'll have hope only if you take the position.

01:30:47.916 --> 01:30:49.457
How many are with you?

01:30:50.708 --> 01:30:51.957
More than you could imagine.

01:30:53.875 --> 01:30:56.374
I've decided, if anything goes wrong,

01:30:56.958 --> 01:30:58.915
I'll sacrifice a few colleagues first.

01:30:59.291 --> 01:31:02.665
In a few days,
I'll let the lost guns and the ransom surface,

01:31:02.958 --> 01:31:04.415
and you're the one who'll solve the case.

01:31:04.583 --> 01:31:06.457
Dad, just one step left.

01:31:07.541 --> 01:31:08.915
I did so much.

01:31:09.208 --> 01:31:10.749
Just the final step for you to take.

01:31:14.666 --> 01:31:20.165
Joe, you'd better answer
my earlier question first.

01:31:31.666 --> 01:31:34.957
If I were you, I wouldn't find so many excuses

01:31:35.083 --> 01:31:36.415
to do so many wrong things.

01:31:46.583 --> 01:31:47.749
I love you, Dad.

01:32:13.041 --> 01:32:14.874
I wanted to see how much he'd changed

01:32:15.208 --> 01:32:16.582
and how much of the old him is left.

01:32:17.625 --> 01:32:20.999
If he didn't pick up the gun,
he would still have hope.

01:32:22.208 --> 01:32:23.957
But he picked up the gun.

01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:26.207
Since then he is no longer my son.

01:32:27.166 --> 01:32:31.665
His future, dead or alive,
has nothing to do with me.

01:33:04.125 --> 01:33:05.540
I've been wrongly tipped off all along.

01:33:06.083 --> 01:33:08.040
How could others say Lee
is far more sophisticated than you?

01:33:08.583 --> 01:33:10.832
Mr Lau, you're incredible!

01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:17.915
Have you ever thought
of joining me in the force?

01:33:21.250 --> 01:33:22.415
Call me.

01:33:44.666 --> 01:33:45.332
Come in.

01:33:47.041 --> 01:33:47.665
Sir

01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:48.415
Sit down.

01:33:56.875 --> 01:33:59.957
Commissioner Tsang, I have a question.

01:34:00.083 --> 01:34:01.332
I know what you're going to ask.

01:34:02.666 --> 01:34:06.040
It's because both Lee
and I have applied for early retirement.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.832
Lau, I can't do much more.

01:34:11.583 --> 01:34:13.540
The future of the Police Force depends on you.

01:34:25.333 --> 01:34:26.165
Lee.

01:34:27.375 --> 01:34:28.207
Sir

01:34:32.250 --> 01:34:35.082
Rule number one: As a superior,

01:34:35.166 --> 01:34:36.957
you never run out to look
for your subordinates.

01:34:37.750 --> 01:34:39.749
Only the opposite should happen.

01:34:39.958 --> 01:34:40.957
Sorry sir

01:34:41.291 --> 01:34:43.040
I should be the one who says that.

01:34:44.958 --> 01:34:46.582
You have no practical operations experience,

01:34:47.375 --> 01:34:49.457
but this became your advantage.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.165
You can look at a case
from a wider perspective.

01:34:52.708 --> 01:34:55.290
Without violating the law or abusing power,

01:34:55.708 --> 01:34:57.124
every department in the force,

01:34:57.625 --> 01:35:00.249
the ICAC and even the Security Bureau

01:35:00.666 --> 01:35:02.207
became your tools to solve the case.

01:35:04.083 --> 01:35:05.749
I doubted your capability all along.

01:35:07.208 --> 01:35:08.624
I was too subjective.

01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:10.749
Thank you, sir.

01:35:11.041 --> 01:35:12.749
But you were wrong on something.

01:35:14.083 --> 01:35:18.540
In World War II, when US President Roosevelt

01:35:18.916 --> 01:35:20.582
asked UK Prime Minister Churchill

01:35:20.666 --> 01:35:22.415
how to describe the war,

01:35:22.583 --> 01:35:23.499
Churchill said

01:35:24.791 --> 01:35:28.540
it was an unnecessary war
that could have been avoided.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.290
He never said all wars are unnecessary.

01:35:32.166 --> 01:35:33.499
The Gathering Storm.

01:35:33.958 --> 01:35:36.207
The last paragraph on the first page.

01:35:36.666 --> 01:35:38.540
I shouldn't have shown off in front of you.

01:36:19.166 --> 01:36:21.832
Operation Cold War was identified
as both a success and a failure

01:36:21.916 --> 01:36:24.457
in government internal review records.

01:36:26.125 --> 01:36:28.082
The records said management
at the Hong Kong police and the ICAC,

01:36:28.125 --> 01:36:30.082
could remain neutral
and they could stick to their positions

01:36:30.125 --> 01:36:32.082
in a crisis threatening
Hong Kong law and order.

01:36:32.083 --> 01:36:34.082
They could uphold the law
while exercising mutual restraint.

01:36:34.083 --> 01:36:35.874
It is an excellent model for cities
following the common law system.

01:36:37.208 --> 01:36:39.582
The review document raised
a number of improvement measures.

01:36:39.625 --> 01:36:41.957
However, after internal assessment
by the government,

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.332
all records are classified as confidential
and cannot be made public

01:36:44.375 --> 01:36:46.749
due to public safety considerations.

01:37:05.208 --> 01:37:06.624
May I know who wants to speak to Mr Lau?

01:37:07.375 --> 01:37:10.582
Please hold on.

01:37:14.708 --> 01:37:15.749
Hello?

01:37:15.916 --> 01:37:18.915
Commissioner Lau, do you still remember me?

01:37:20.791 --> 01:37:21.540
Yes, I remember.

01:37:22.166 --> 01:37:23.957
Your wife is Michelle Chan,
