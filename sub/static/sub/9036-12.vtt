WEBVTT

00:04.072 --> 00:06.607
- THE FORECAST: CLOUDY SKIES
WITH FLURRIES TODAY.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.409
WE CAN EXPECT
UP TO AN INCH OF SNOW

00:08.442 --> 00:10.444
AND A HIGH OF ONLY 30...

00:17.418 --> 00:19.253
- [sighs]

00:20.388 --> 00:21.755
COME ON. DEB!

00:21.789 --> 00:23.424
- WHAT?

00:23.457 --> 00:25.359
- I CAN'T SEE.
I HATE THIS SIDE OF THE BED.

00:25.393 --> 00:27.061
I CAN'T SEE THE TV FROM HERE.

00:27.095 --> 00:29.563
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU PICKED THAT SIDE.

00:29.597 --> 00:33.834
- I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS
GOING TO BE MY SIDE FOR LIFE.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.469
I GOT TO WATCH TV
WITH A BIG FOOT

00:35.503 --> 00:38.339
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN.

00:38.372 --> 00:39.507
COME ON, I'M TRYING
TO GET THE WEATHER.

00:39.540 --> 00:43.544
I CAN ONLY GET
FROM WEDNESDAY OVER.

00:43.577 --> 00:45.179
- DO YOU WANT
TO SWITCH SIDES?

00:45.213 --> 00:46.847
- WHAT, AFTER SEVEN YEARS?

00:46.880 --> 00:49.717
I'LL BE ALL OUT OF WHACK
OVER THERE.

00:49.750 --> 00:53.754
- MAYBE YOU'LL DO BETTER
WITH YOUR NEXT WIFE.

00:53.787 --> 00:56.657
- MY NEXT WIFE
ISN'T GOING TO HAVE FEET.

00:59.427 --> 01:02.363
THAT'S RIGHT.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.232
I'LL BE ABLE TO WATCH THE TV,

01:04.265 --> 01:06.267
AND I'LL NEVER
HAVE TO GO DANCING.

01:13.507 --> 01:14.875
HI, I'M RAY.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.477
I LIVE HERE IN LONG ISLAND

01:16.510 --> 01:18.579
WITH MY WIFE, DEBRA,

01:18.612 --> 01:20.481
MY FIVE-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER,

01:20.514 --> 01:23.217
AND TWIN
ALMOST-TWO-YEAR-OLD BOYS.

01:23.251 --> 01:25.686
MY PARENTS LIVE
ACROSS THE STREET.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.588
THAT'S RIGHT.

01:27.621 --> 01:30.191
THE TRUTH IS,
I'D DO ANYTHING FOR MY FAMILY.

01:33.327 --> 01:35.496
AND DONE.

01:35.529 --> 01:38.232
OH, NO.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.602
DEBRA!

01:41.635 --> 01:43.371
HONEY!

01:43.404 --> 01:46.240
SOMEBODY CALL MY FATHER!

01:46.274 --> 01:48.242
I'M HYPERVENTILATING!

01:54.348 --> 01:56.450
- YEAH, IT'S A CHARITY DRIVE,
LINDA.

01:56.484 --> 01:58.419
HMM-MM, YEAH, WE'LL TAKE
ANYTHING YOU WANT TO GET RID OF.

01:58.452 --> 02:01.422
AH, NO, NOT HIM.

02:01.455 --> 02:03.257
[doorbell rings]

02:03.291 --> 02:05.326
HANG ON. HEY, RAY,
CAN YOU GET THAT PLEASE?

02:05.359 --> 02:06.794
- I'M ALL BOXED IN OVER HERE.

02:06.827 --> 02:10.764
[toy clacking and squeaking]

02:10.798 --> 02:13.667
[doorbell rings]
- COMING.

02:13.701 --> 02:15.269
WHAT ARE THE TWINS DOING?

02:15.303 --> 02:16.237
- THEY'RE PLAYING.
THEY'RE PLAYING.

02:16.270 --> 02:17.605
MICHAEL THINKS HE'S IN A CAR,

02:17.638 --> 02:19.407
AND GEOFFREY JUST THINKS
HE'S IN A BOX.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.141
THE KID'S GOT NO IMAGINATION.

02:23.777 --> 02:25.546
- HEY!
- HEY.

02:25.579 --> 02:26.947
BROUGHT SOME STUFF OVER
FOR THE CHURCH DRIVE.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.250
- OH, GREAT.
- IT'S A LITTLE HEAVY.

02:29.283 --> 02:30.484
- THANKS, ROBERT.
THAT'S SWEET. WHAT IS IT?

02:30.518 --> 02:32.253
- MY WEIGHT SET.

02:34.288 --> 02:35.489
- YOU'RE NOT WORKING OUT
ANYMORE?

02:35.523 --> 02:37.625
- NO, I'M LOSING
SOME OF MY FLEXIBILITY.

02:37.658 --> 02:40.294
HAVING TROUBLE SHAMPOOING.

02:40.328 --> 02:41.829
THAT'S A LOT OF STUFF HERE.

02:41.862 --> 02:42.863
- YEAH.

02:42.896 --> 02:44.532
- A LOT OF UGLY STUFF.

02:44.565 --> 02:46.400
WHO WOULD BUY THIS?

02:46.434 --> 02:48.969
- YOU BOUGHT IT FOR ME.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.838
- OH.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.940
HOW COME YOU NEVER WEAR IT?

02:52.973 --> 02:55.776
- HEY, RAYMOND.
YOU'RE GIVING THIS AWAY?

02:55.809 --> 02:56.944
- WHAT IS IT?

02:56.977 --> 02:59.947
OH, MY GOD.
DEBRA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:59.980 --> 03:01.849
- WHAT?
IT'S JUST AN OLD BASEBALL.

03:01.882 --> 03:03.817
- JUST A BASEBALL?
JUST A BASEBALL.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.953
I'VE HAD THIS THING
FOR 25 YEARS.

03:05.986 --> 03:08.389
THIS IS MY AUTOGRAPHED
MICKEY MANTLE BALL.

03:08.422 --> 03:11.892
- OH, DEBRA.

03:11.925 --> 03:13.361
- SORRY.

03:13.394 --> 03:15.563
I MEAN,
SO MICKEY MANTLE SIGNED IT.

03:15.596 --> 03:17.265
I MEAN--
- "SO?"

03:17.298 --> 03:18.666
"SO."

03:18.699 --> 03:21.535
THIS IS LIKE
HAVING A BIBLE SIGNED BY--

03:21.569 --> 03:24.272
[mumbling]
- YEAH.

03:24.305 --> 03:26.707
IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.942
MY DAD GOT ME THIS
WHEN I WAS TEN.

03:28.976 --> 03:31.612
REMEMBER?
- YEAH, I REMEMBER.

03:31.645 --> 03:34.848
YOU GOT MICKEY MANTLE.
I GOT ART SHAMSKY.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.251
- AND YOU WANTED
ART SHAMSKY.

03:37.285 --> 03:39.353
- HEY, HE HOMERED HIS FIRST
MAJOR LEAGUE AT BAT.

03:39.387 --> 03:42.590
THEN AFTER THAT,
RIGHT INTO THE DUMPER.

03:42.623 --> 03:44.758
- HE COULD STILL BECOME FAMOUS.

03:44.792 --> 03:47.395
- YEAH, IF HE SHOOTS
SOMEONE FAMOUS.

03:47.428 --> 03:49.730
- I HAVEN'T THOUGHT
ABOUT THIS BALL IN YEARS.

03:49.763 --> 03:52.666
[knocking at door]

03:52.700 --> 03:54.435
- HI, RAY.

03:54.468 --> 03:55.803
- HEY.
- MISTLETOE.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.638
- OH.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.473
I'M NOT KISSING YOU, BUDDY.
YOU'RE ALL HANDS.

03:59.507 --> 04:02.310
- YOU USED TO LOVE THAT
ABOUT ME.

04:02.343 --> 04:04.445
WHAT'S WITH ALL THE BOXES?

04:04.478 --> 04:06.714
- OH, UH--

04:06.747 --> 04:08.282
OH, THIS IS MY STUFF.

04:08.316 --> 04:09.683
DEB AND I, UH--

04:09.717 --> 04:11.952
IT AIN'T HAPPENING.

04:11.985 --> 04:14.655
- THAT'S TOO BAD.
- YEAH.

04:14.688 --> 04:17.057
- MIND IF I CALL HER?

04:17.090 --> 04:20.060
- IT'S A CHARITY DRIVE
FOR THE NEEDY, ANDY.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.963
- OH, GREAT.
WHAT CAN I HAVE?

04:22.996 --> 04:27.401
- YEAH, IT'S NOT FOR
THE EMOTIONALLY NEEDY.

04:27.435 --> 04:28.669
- ANDY, I EVER SHOW YOU THAT?

04:28.702 --> 04:29.903
THAT'S MY MICKEY MANTLE.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.505
- WOW!

04:31.539 --> 04:33.341
YOU MET THE MICKELA?

04:33.374 --> 04:35.743
- NO.
NO, MY DAD GOT IT FOR ME.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.044
PRETTY INCREDIBLE, HUH?

04:37.077 --> 04:39.480
- YEAH, IF MICKEY
REALLY SIGNED IT.

04:39.513 --> 04:41.014
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

04:41.048 --> 04:42.916
- DIDN'T YOU SEE THAT THING
ON "60 MINUTES"?

04:42.950 --> 04:45.553
ALL THIS SIGNED STUFF
IS, LIKE, 70% FAKE.

04:45.586 --> 04:48.322
LIKE, BACK THEN, THE TRAINERS
WOULD SIGN ALL THE BALLS.

04:48.356 --> 04:50.324
- YEAH.
YOU KNOW, I SAW THAT.

04:50.358 --> 04:54.061
OH, RAYMOND.
THIS MAY NOT BE REAL.

04:54.094 --> 04:56.497
THAT'S A SHAME.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.101
- YEAH, RIGHT.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.804
DAD GOT THIS FOR ME HIMSELF,
ALL RIGHT?

05:03.837 --> 05:06.039
- MAYBE MORLEY SAFER'S WRONG.

05:06.073 --> 05:10.378
- [chuckling]

05:10.411 --> 05:12.012
HEY, ANDY, WANT TO GO
FOR A SLICE?

05:12.045 --> 05:13.046
- SURE.
YOU IN, RAY?

05:13.080 --> 05:15.349
- NO, NO, GO AHEAD.
YOU GUYS GO.

05:15.383 --> 05:17.685
- ALL RIGHT.
COME ON, PEPPY.

05:17.718 --> 05:18.986
- HEY, LISTEN.

05:19.019 --> 05:20.588
ANDY, CAN I BORROW
THAT MISTLETOE?

05:20.621 --> 05:23.457
I WANT TO BREAK THE ICE
WITH A WOMAN IN HOMICIDE.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.630
- YOU OKAY, RAY?

05:29.663 --> 05:31.832
- WHAT IF THEY'RE RIGHT?
WHAT IF HE DIDN'T SIGN THIS?

05:31.865 --> 05:33.701
- COME ON, RAY.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.536
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER YOU
EVER LOOKING AT THAT BALL.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.605
IT'S BEEN BURIED IN THE CLOSET
SINCE WE MOVED HERE.

05:37.638 --> 05:40.107
- NO, NOT BURIED.
TUCKED AWAY.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.809
YOU DON'T--
YOU DON'T GET IT.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.777
MICKEY MANTLE SIGNED THIS TO ME.

05:43.811 --> 05:45.546
"TO RAY."

05:45.579 --> 05:47.415
RAY.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.483
THEN HE WISHES ME LUCK.

05:49.517 --> 05:54.021
GOOD LUCK.

05:54.054 --> 05:56.023
THEN HE SIGNS IT.

05:56.056 --> 05:57.858
"MICKEY MANTLE."

05:57.891 --> 05:59.827
LOOK AT THAT,
LOOK HOW THE "Y" IN THE "RAY"

05:59.860 --> 06:03.764
IS THE SAME AS THE "Y"
IN THE "MICKEY."

06:03.797 --> 06:05.633
YOU KNOW, FOR ONE MOMENT,

06:05.666 --> 06:07.401
THE GREATEST PLAYER
THAT I EVER SAW

06:07.435 --> 06:10.037
WAS THINKING ABOUT ME.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.672
I KNOW IT SOUNDS STUPID,
BUT THIS GUY--

06:11.705 --> 06:14.742
THIS GUY'S THE REASON
THAT I'M A SPORTSWRITER.

06:14.775 --> 06:16.076
THIS GUY--

06:16.109 --> 06:19.747
THIS GUY'S...
MICKEY MANTLE.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.817
- GEE, THAT'S BEAUTIFUL, RAY.

06:23.851 --> 06:27.655
IT'S VERY PASSIONATE.

06:27.688 --> 06:30.924
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID
TO ME WHEN YOU PROPOSED?

06:30.958 --> 06:33.393
"SO HOW 'BOUT IT?"

06:43.537 --> 06:45.873
- WHY DO YOU INSIST
ON MAKING THIS CAR WRECK

06:45.906 --> 06:49.109
OUR CHRISTMAS TREE EVERY YEAR?

06:49.142 --> 06:51.579
I MEAN, I WANT A REAL TREE.

06:51.612 --> 06:54.047
- AN ARTIFICIAL TREE
SAVES WATER,

06:54.081 --> 06:57.084
SAVES THE FOREST,
AND SAVES THE PLANET.

06:57.117 --> 06:59.787
I'M A CONSERVATIONIST.

06:59.820 --> 07:02.690
- YOU'RE CHEAP.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.091
- ALL RIGHT,
I'M SAVING MONEY.

07:04.124 --> 07:06.594
- OH!
I HATE THIS THING.

07:06.627 --> 07:09.763
- FINE, THEN THERE'LL BE NOTHING
UNDER IT FOR YOU.

07:09.797 --> 07:13.501
- LIKE I NEED ANOTHER
TOTES UMBRELLA.

07:13.534 --> 07:16.169
HEY, RAY DARLING!
- HI.

07:16.203 --> 07:17.905
- MERRY CHRISTMAS!

07:17.938 --> 07:20.741
- HEY, HEY, MERRY CHRISTMAS.
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

07:20.774 --> 07:21.775
OKAY.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.110
OH.

07:23.143 --> 07:24.945
DID ROCKEFELLER CENTER

07:24.978 --> 07:27.180
TURN IT DOWN AGAIN THIS YEAR?

07:27.214 --> 07:29.717
IT'S A SHAME.
HERE, MA.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.118
DEBRA SAYS THANKS
FOR THE CLOTHES.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.886
- WHAT CLOTHES?

07:32.920 --> 07:34.254
- OH, IT'S YOUR JUNK,

07:34.287 --> 07:36.790
LIKE THAT RATTY,
MOTH-EATEN GRAY SWEATER.

07:36.824 --> 07:38.091
- MOTH-EATEN?

07:38.125 --> 07:40.694
MARIE, I LOVE THAT SWEATER.

07:40.728 --> 07:43.163
AND I DON'T WANT TO SEE
ANY WILD-EYED WEIRDO

07:43.196 --> 07:46.567
MARCHING AROUND IN MY CLOTHES!

07:46.600 --> 07:49.036
- WELCOME TO MY WORLD, FRANK.

07:53.807 --> 07:57.745
- HOLIDAYS ARE A VERY
STRESSFUL TIME FOR YOUR MOTHER.

07:57.778 --> 07:59.246
HOW ARE THINGS AT YOUR HOUSE?

07:59.279 --> 08:00.814
- YEAH, WE'RE BUSY.
WE'RE BUSY TOO.

08:00.848 --> 08:02.182
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

08:02.215 --> 08:03.717
WE WERE CLEANING THINGS OUT
THIS MORNING,

08:03.751 --> 08:05.719
AND LOOK WHAT I FOUND.

08:05.753 --> 08:06.920
REMEMBER THIS?

08:06.954 --> 08:10.290
- OH, HEY, LOOK AT THAT.

08:10.323 --> 08:14.027
GOD, I REMEMBER WHEN
I BROUGHT THIS HOME FOR YOU.

08:14.061 --> 08:16.029
WHAT WERE YOU, LIKE, TEN?

08:16.063 --> 08:17.898
YOU RAN ALL AROUND
THE NEIGHBORHOOD

08:17.931 --> 08:20.734
SHOWING IT TO THE OTHER KIDS,
RIGHT?

08:20.768 --> 08:22.202
- YEAH, SO--

08:22.235 --> 08:23.904
SO MICKEY MANTLE
REALLY SIGNED IT?

08:23.937 --> 08:26.807
- WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

08:26.840 --> 08:28.809
- YOU. YOU DID.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.845
- OH.
- WH--

08:34.615 --> 08:36.717
WAIT. MICKEY MANTLE
DIDN'T SIGN THIS BALL?

08:36.750 --> 08:38.018
THIS ISN'T REAL?

08:38.051 --> 08:41.555
- IT'S A REAL BALL.

08:41.589 --> 08:43.691
- I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.626
SO YOU NEVER MET HIM.

08:45.659 --> 08:46.894
- NO.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.765
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

08:51.799 --> 08:55.168
- NO, NOTHING, NOTHING.

08:58.138 --> 09:01.208
- IT LOOKS LIKE I'M
THE ONLY NORMAL ONE HERE.

09:03.176 --> 09:05.345
- HOW COULD MY FATHER DO THIS?

09:05.378 --> 09:08.281
HE KNEW WHAT THAT BALL MEANT
TO ME.

09:08.315 --> 09:10.684
- RAY, I'M SURE
IT WASN'T INTENTIONAL.

09:10.718 --> 09:12.185
HE PROBABLY DIDN'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT IT.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.621
- YEAH, YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.756
HE JUST THOUGHT
IT WAS OKAY TO LIE TO HIS KID.

09:15.789 --> 09:17.691
- LOOK, EVERYBODY DOES THAT
SOMETIMES.

09:17.725 --> 09:19.693
- NO, NO.
I DON'T.

09:19.727 --> 09:21.094
- OH, NO?

09:21.128 --> 09:23.997
WHAT ABOUT, "NO, KIDS,
THAT'S NOT A STORE.

09:24.031 --> 09:27.367
THAT'S A TOY MUSEUM"?

09:27.400 --> 09:29.136
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

09:29.169 --> 09:30.804
- AND MY FAVORITE ONE IS,

09:30.838 --> 09:33.874
"UH, DADDY'S JUST
TEACHING MOMMY HOW TO WRESTLE."

09:37.210 --> 09:39.312
- YEAH,
THAT'S MY FAVORITE ONE TOO.

09:39.346 --> 09:42.049
BUT NO MORE.
NO MORE.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.951
I'M NOT GOING TO LIE TO MY KIDS
ANYMORE.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.185
- YES, YOU WILL, RAY.

09:45.218 --> 09:47.387
- NO, NO, I WILL NOT.
UH-UH.

09:47.420 --> 09:50.157
I'M NOT GOING TO DO TO THEM
WHAT MY FATHER DID TO ME.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.225
FROM NOW ON, ONLY THE TRUTH.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.227
WHEN MY KIDS LOOK BACK AT ME,

09:54.261 --> 09:56.697
I WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO SAY,

09:56.730 --> 09:58.999
"OKAY, I'M ALL SCREWED UP
FROM THAT GUY,

09:59.032 --> 10:01.969
BUT HE DIDN'T LIE."

10:02.002 --> 10:05.205
- WHAT A LOVELY THOUGHT
FOR OUR CHILDREN, RAY.

10:07.407 --> 10:09.777
- CAN I HAVE THIS DOLLY, DADDY?

10:09.810 --> 10:11.278
- NO, NO, HONEY.

10:11.311 --> 10:12.412
WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THESE TOYS

10:12.445 --> 10:14.682
TO OTHER KIDS
FOR CHRISTMAS, OKAY?

10:14.715 --> 10:18.418
- BUT YOU SAID SANTA BRINGS
ALL THE TOYS.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.721
- I SAID SANTA?

10:22.690 --> 10:24.157
- DOESN'T HE, DADDY?

10:34.334 --> 10:37.938
DADDY?

10:37.971 --> 10:39.973
- DADDY?

10:42.042 --> 10:47.314
- WOULD YOU MIND
REPEATING THE QUESTION?

10:47.347 --> 10:50.884
- DOESN'T SANTA BRING
ALL THE TOYS?

10:50.918 --> 10:54.254
- TO BE HONEST--
- DON'T YOU DARE.

10:54.287 --> 10:56.056
- WHAT, DADDY?

10:56.089 --> 10:58.926
- WHO WANTS COOKIES, HUH?

11:00.193 --> 11:02.262
- TELL ME ABOUT SANTA,
DADDY.

11:02.295 --> 11:03.964
- WELL...

11:10.503 --> 11:13.340
THE ANSWER, I THINK, HONEY,

11:13.373 --> 11:16.877
COMES DOWN TO THE BASIC NATURE
OF REALITY.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.081
OKEY-DOKEY?

11:21.114 --> 11:23.984
NO.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.119
HONEY...

11:26.153 --> 11:28.255
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO TELL YOU THIS, BUT--

11:28.288 --> 11:30.223
AH!

11:35.495 --> 11:39.132
- OF COURSE SANTA BRINGS
ALL THE TOYS, HONEY.

11:39.166 --> 11:41.034
WE'RE JUST GOING TO BE
SANTA'S HELPERS

11:41.068 --> 11:43.837
BECAUSE HE HAS SO MUCH TO CARRY
THIS YEAR,

11:43.871 --> 11:47.374
AND HE'S OUT OF SHAPE.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.042
- OH, THAT'S NICE.

11:49.076 --> 11:50.410
- YEAH, SO LISTEN, HONEY,

11:50.443 --> 11:51.745
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO
AND PLAY WITH YOUR TOYS

11:51.779 --> 11:53.313
FROM LAST YEAR,

11:53.346 --> 11:55.248
AND I'M GOING TO HAVE
A NICE LONG TALK WITH YOUR DADDY

11:55.282 --> 11:58.986
ABOUT THE NATURE
OF HIS REALITY, OKAY?

12:04.024 --> 12:07.861
GOD.
- OKAY, HERE WE GO.

12:07.895 --> 12:09.529
- HOW COULD YOU DO THAT
TO HER?

12:09.562 --> 12:10.898
- WHAT?
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.833
- OH, YOU WERE ABOUT TO.

12:12.866 --> 12:14.868
RAY, I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET
WITH YOUR FATHER,

12:14.902 --> 12:19.272
BUT HOW CAN YOU THINK ABOUT
OUTING SANTA?

12:19.306 --> 12:21.341
- WELL, WOULD YOU RATHER
SHE HEARD IT ON THE STREETS?

12:21.374 --> 12:24.878
- OH, PLEASE.

12:24.912 --> 12:27.047
- I'M SORRY
TO HAVE TO DO THIS, DEBRA,

12:27.080 --> 12:28.949
BUT FRANK IS ABSOLUTELY
INSISTING

12:28.982 --> 12:30.918
HE GET
HIS RATTY OLD SWEATER BACK,

12:30.951 --> 12:32.252
WHICH IS PROBABLY
THE BEST THING

12:32.285 --> 12:35.388
THAT EVER HAPPENED
TO THE NEEDY.

12:35.422 --> 12:36.389
- GO, TAKE IT.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.058
- UH-OH.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.292
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

12:39.326 --> 12:40.994
- NOTHING. NOTHING.
NOTHING'S THE MATTER.

12:41.028 --> 12:42.495
- NO, NOTHING AT ALL,

12:42.529 --> 12:44.832
EXCEPT RAY WAS JUST ABOUT
TO TELL ALLY THE TRUTH

12:44.865 --> 12:47.267
ABOUT SANTA CLAUS.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.536
- YOU WHAT?
- OH, I DIDN'T TELL HER.

12:49.569 --> 12:53.540
- MY OWN SON AN ATHEIST?

12:53.573 --> 12:55.442
- I'M NOT AN ATHEIST, MA.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.811
I JUST--I DON'T BELIEVE
IN LYING TO MY KIDS.

12:57.845 --> 12:58.879
- OH, STOP BEING FOOLISH.

12:58.912 --> 13:00.213
NOW, YOU GO RIGHT IN THERE

13:00.247 --> 13:02.149
AND TELL ALLY
ALL ABOUT SANTA CLAUS

13:02.182 --> 13:04.584
AND HIS FLYING REINDEER
AND HIS SLED

13:04.617 --> 13:06.386
AND ALL THE REST
OF THAT MALARKEY.

13:06.419 --> 13:07.888
- I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S
THE RIGHT THING.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.256
- OH, WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

13:09.289 --> 13:10.557
- NOTHING'S THE MATTER.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.292
I'M JUST--
I'M PROTECTING HER.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.527
- OH, PROTECTING HER
FROM WHAT?

13:14.561 --> 13:16.930
WE DIDN'T HAVE
THAT SANTA CLAUS DISCUSSION

13:16.964 --> 13:19.366
UNTIL YOU WERE 14 YEARS OLD.

13:19.399 --> 13:22.102
- YEAH, WELL, I KNEW ABOUT SANTA
WHEN I WAS 8.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.838
WHY'D YOU WAIT
TILL I WAS 14 FOR?

13:24.872 --> 13:28.842
- WELL, YOUR FATHER WANTED TO
COVER SEX AND SANTA ALL AT ONCE,

13:28.876 --> 13:31.411
SORT OF GET IT OVER WITH.

13:31.444 --> 13:33.981
- DON'T THINK THAT HASN'T HAD
REPERCUSSIONS.

13:36.083 --> 13:38.051
- HERE YOU GO, MARIE.
- OH, THANKS, HONEY.

13:38.085 --> 13:41.621
LISTEN, ALLY IS FIVE YEARS OLD,
YOU SCROOGE.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.991
OF COURSE WE LIE.

13:44.024 --> 13:45.292
WE ALL LIE.

13:45.325 --> 13:48.261
THAT'S WHAT HOLDS US ALL
TOGETHER.

13:48.295 --> 13:51.131
SO YOU GO IN
AND LIE TO YOUR DAUGHTER,

13:51.164 --> 13:54.067
AND I'LL GO HOME
AND FEED THE MAN I LOVE.

13:59.907 --> 14:01.308
- RAY, COME ON.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.343
ARE YOU STILL THINKING
ABOUT THAT BASEBALL?

14:03.376 --> 14:04.611
- NO.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.579
NO, I'M THINKING ABOUT
A LOT OF THINGS NOW.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.315
- LIKE WHAT?

14:08.348 --> 14:10.650
- REMEMBER THAT GUY THAT
YOU WENT OUT WITH BEFORE ME,

14:10.683 --> 14:13.053
ERIC BUTTERPANTS?

14:13.086 --> 14:14.521
- [laughs]

14:14.554 --> 14:15.956
- ERIC BUTTERMAN, RAY.

14:15.989 --> 14:18.959
- YEAH, OH,
SO YOU DO REMEMBER HIM.

14:18.992 --> 14:21.194
- YEAH.
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

14:21.228 --> 14:22.529
- YOU ALWAYS SAID TO ME

14:22.562 --> 14:24.431
THAT YOU WERE GLAD
THAT HE BROKE UP WITH YOU

14:24.464 --> 14:26.233
BECAUSE OTHERWISE
YOU WOULD HAVE NEVER MET ME.

14:26.266 --> 14:27.467
- YEAH. SO?

14:27.500 --> 14:29.602
- SO IF HE HAD NEVER
BROKEN UP WITH YOU,

14:29.636 --> 14:31.905
WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN GLADDER?

14:34.374 --> 14:36.476
- YOU ARE REALLY CRAZY.
YOU KNOW THAT?

14:36.509 --> 14:38.611
- NO. NO, NO, NO.
HOW DO I KNOW?

14:38.645 --> 14:41.048
HOW DO I KNOW THAT I'M THE ONE
YOU WANTED TO END UP WITH?

14:41.081 --> 14:44.117
- HERE'S A HINT, RAY:
OUR THREE KIDS.

14:44.151 --> 14:46.386
- YEAH.
YEAH, OUR THREE BLOND KIDS.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.255
- OH.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.490
I THINK THAT'S
THE BASEBALL TALKING.

14:50.523 --> 14:52.025
- HOW CAN I BE SURE
OF ANYTHING?

14:52.059 --> 14:53.226
- SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

14:53.260 --> 14:54.561
YOU DON'T BELIEVE
IN ANYTHING ANYMORE?

14:54.594 --> 14:57.564
- THAT'S RIGHT, UNLESS I SEE IT
WITH MY OWN EYES.

14:57.597 --> 15:00.900
- HO, HO, HO!
MERRY CHRISTMAS!

15:02.235 --> 15:04.137
IS ALLY HERE?

15:04.171 --> 15:05.605
I UNDERSTAND
THERE ARE DOUBTS ABOUT ME

15:05.638 --> 15:07.640
IN THIS HOUSE.

15:07.674 --> 15:10.377
- THERE ARE NOW.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.345
COME ON, ROBERT.
- NO, NO.

15:12.379 --> 15:14.414
YOU HAVE ME MISTAKEN
FOR SOME OTHER PARTY,

15:14.447 --> 15:16.649
FOR I AM
THE JOLLY OLD SAINT NICK.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.451
HO, HO, HO, HO!

15:18.485 --> 15:21.188
MOM TOLD ME WHAT YOU DID.
NICE.

15:22.722 --> 15:24.457
- HEY, ALLY, LOOK,
IT'S SANTA CLAUS.

15:24.491 --> 15:26.126
- OH, GOD.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.128
- SANTA?

15:28.161 --> 15:29.997
- YES, IT IS REALLY I,

15:30.030 --> 15:31.631
AND I CAME TO SEE YOU, ALLY,

15:31.664 --> 15:34.501
BECAUSE I HEARD YOU WERE
A VERY GOOD GIRL THIS YEAR,

15:34.534 --> 15:37.037
AND YOU'RE GOING TO GET
EVERYTHING YOU WANT,

15:37.070 --> 15:40.673
UNLIKE SOME OTHER PEOPLE.

15:40.707 --> 15:43.376
HO, HO, HO, HO, HO.

15:43.410 --> 15:45.412
- ALL RIGHT,
HOLD THE "HO"S, OKAY?

15:45.445 --> 15:46.579
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE, SANTA.

15:46.613 --> 15:50.550
- I'M SORRY.
I'M WITH A CLIENT.

15:50.583 --> 15:52.752
AND YOU MAY CALL ME
MR. CLAUS.

15:52.785 --> 15:55.488
HO, HO, HO, HO!

15:55.522 --> 15:57.690
- WHERE'S ALLY?

15:57.724 --> 15:59.659
HO, HO!

15:59.692 --> 16:02.329
HOLY CRAP!

16:03.796 --> 16:05.332
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

16:05.365 --> 16:07.734
- I'M SANTA CLAUS.
- YOU'RE SANTA?

16:07.767 --> 16:09.436
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
WILL YOU GUYS CUT IT OUT?

16:09.469 --> 16:11.238
COME ON; SHE'S CONFUSED
ENOUGH ALREADY.

16:11.271 --> 16:13.106
- WHAT'S TO BE CONFUSED ABOUT?

16:13.140 --> 16:15.542
I'M THE REAL SANTA.

16:15.575 --> 16:18.345
WHO IS THIS IMPOSTOR?

16:18.378 --> 16:21.248
- WELL, YOU COULDN'T BOTH
BE SANTA.

16:21.281 --> 16:24.651
YOU MUST BE SANTA'S HELPERS.

16:24.684 --> 16:27.754
- RIGHT.
HE'S MY HELPER.

16:27.787 --> 16:30.023
- HEY, HELPER, WHY DON'T YOU
WARM UP THE REINDEER

16:30.057 --> 16:31.624
AND BRING THE SLED AROUND?

16:31.658 --> 16:33.760
- I BET YOU CAN'T EVEN NAME
THE REINDEER.

16:33.793 --> 16:36.296
- WHOA! OH!

16:36.329 --> 16:37.430
RUDOLPH.

16:37.464 --> 16:39.232
UH, DONNER.

16:39.266 --> 16:41.134
BLITZEN.

16:41.168 --> 16:42.769
THOSE ARE THE MAIN ONES.

16:44.804 --> 16:48.075
WE ROTATE THEM
SO THEY WEAR EVENLY.

16:48.108 --> 16:51.278
UH, CUPID.

16:51.311 --> 16:53.646
AJAX.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.783
AND LEFTY.

16:56.816 --> 16:58.718
- AHA!
NOW WE KNOW THE TRUTH.

16:58.751 --> 17:01.221
HO, HO, HO, HO, HO!

17:01.254 --> 17:03.156
- IT'S UNCLE ROBERT.

17:03.190 --> 17:04.791
- NO, NO, LITTLE ONE.

17:04.824 --> 17:06.726
I'VE ONLY ASSUMED THE BODY

17:06.759 --> 17:09.296
OF A LIFE-FORM
THAT YOU WOULD ACCEPT.

17:11.764 --> 17:15.635
- ROBERT, YOU'RE SANTA,
NOT A KLINGON.

17:15.668 --> 17:18.071
- AND THAT'S GRANDPA.

17:18.105 --> 17:20.507
- THAT'S VERY GOOD, ALLY.
THIS IS GRANDPA.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.742
OKAY, GUYS, YOU COULDN'T
FOOL HER, OKAY? COME ON.

17:22.775 --> 17:24.511
- PULLING THE BEARD
OFF SANTA CLAUS.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.379
THE NERVE OF THIS GUY.

17:26.413 --> 17:27.580
- IF YOU WANT TO DO SOME GOOD,

17:27.614 --> 17:31.584
GO WORK THE CORNER
WITH A BUCKET.

17:31.618 --> 17:35.222
- JUST FOR THAT, NO TOYS.

17:37.390 --> 17:38.825
- WHY DID THEY DO THAT?

17:38.858 --> 17:40.560
- OH, HONEY, IT'S JUST BECAUSE

17:40.593 --> 17:43.730
GRANDPA AND UNCLE ROBERT
LOVE YOU SO MUCH,

17:43.763 --> 17:46.533
AND THEY JUST WANT YOU TO HAVE
A WONDERFUL CHRISTMAS.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.468
- OH.

17:50.537 --> 17:52.572
- THAT'S GOOD.
YOU THINK SHE'S BETTER OFF NOW?

17:52.605 --> 17:55.175
- OH, THEY WERE JUST TRYING
TO HELP, RAY.

17:55.208 --> 18:00.580
- YEAH, LET THEM HELP BY PAYING
HER SHRINK BILLS, HUH,

18:00.613 --> 18:02.382
WHEN SHE'S HAVING NIGHTMARES
ABOUT TWO SANTAS

18:02.415 --> 18:04.784
AND A REINDEER NAMED LEFTY.

18:09.222 --> 18:11.291
- HEY, RAY.

18:11.324 --> 18:12.692
- DAD, DO ME A FAVOR

18:12.725 --> 18:15.462
AND DON'T COME OVER AND MAKE UP
STORIES TO ALLY, OKAY?

18:15.495 --> 18:17.464
- COME ON.
I'M A GRANDFATHER.

18:17.497 --> 18:18.765
THAT'S WHAT I DO.

18:18.798 --> 18:21.168
I TELL STORIES.

18:21.201 --> 18:24.437
IT'S IN THE MANUAL.

18:24.471 --> 18:26.706
- LIKE YOU TOLD ME STORIES,
RIGHT, DAD?

18:26.739 --> 18:28.375
- WHAT IS IT?

18:28.408 --> 18:32.145
- YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
THIS THING MEANT TO ME?

18:32.179 --> 18:35.382
- OH, COME ON, RAY.
IT'S ONLY A BALL.

18:35.415 --> 18:37.784
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT, DAD.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:37.817 --> 18:40.119
THAT'S ALL IT IS NOW.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.490
- WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

18:43.523 --> 18:44.824
- DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
IT MEANT TO ME

18:44.857 --> 18:46.459
TO HAVE A MICKEY MANTLE?

18:46.493 --> 18:47.860
AND WHAT DID YOU DO?

18:47.894 --> 18:51.398
YOU BROUGHT HOME A FAKE.

18:51.431 --> 18:55.435
- WHAT--WHAT WAS I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

18:55.468 --> 18:58.271
I DIDN'T KNOW MICKEY MANTLE,

18:58.305 --> 19:00.573
AND YOU WANTED HIS AUTOGRAPH.

19:00.607 --> 19:02.909
SO I WENT BACK FOR FIVE GAMES,

19:02.942 --> 19:05.445
AND I STOOD
BY THE STADIUM DOOR,

19:05.478 --> 19:07.847
AND MANTLE NEVER CAME OUT.

19:07.880 --> 19:10.417
- SO YOU JUST GOT SOME TRAINER
TO SIGN IT.

19:10.450 --> 19:12.352
- NO.

19:13.653 --> 19:16.456
I SIGNED IT MYSELF.

19:18.391 --> 19:19.626
- YOU SIGNED IT?

19:19.659 --> 19:23.663
- YEAH, I KNEW HOW MUCH
YOU WANTED THE THING,

19:23.696 --> 19:27.534
SO I PRACTICED HIS SIGNATURE
OVER AND OVER.

19:27.567 --> 19:31.604
[chuckles]
NOT A BAD JOB, HUH?

19:31.638 --> 19:33.540
YOU KNOW, IF I COULD HAVE
GOTTEN HOLD

19:33.573 --> 19:34.874
OF THE MICK'S CHECKBOOK,

19:34.907 --> 19:38.478
WE'D BE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION
ON A YACHT.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.882
- WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST
TELL ME THE TRUTH?

19:42.915 --> 19:46.319
- AH, I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO BE DISAPPOINTED.

19:48.521 --> 19:49.822
YOU'RE MY KID.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.530
I DON'T BLAME YOU
FOR BEING TICKED OFF.

19:57.564 --> 20:00.500
I'M SORRY I SIGNED IT.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.876
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:09.909 --> 20:12.412
- I WANT IT NOW.

20:25.858 --> 20:28.295
- YOU--YOU--

20:28.328 --> 20:30.797
