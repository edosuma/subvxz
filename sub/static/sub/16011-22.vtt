01:55.480 --> 01:56.720
Good morning!

01:56.760 --> 01:58.840
Hello, I'll take four boxes.

01:58.880 --> 02:00.100
No, six.

02:00.101 --> 02:01.320
Six boxes of chocolate.

02:01.360 --> 02:03.440
- Wow.
- You think you got enough there?

02:03.480 --> 02:04.720
You're right. Better

02:04.721 --> 02:05.960
make that eight. [chuckles]

02:06.000 --> 02:07.560
I had no idea

02:07.561 --> 02:09.120
you were so into fundraising.

02:09.160 --> 02:10.320
It's not the fundraising.

02:10.321 --> 02:11.480
It's the sweet prize

02:11.520 --> 02:13.240
for being the top fundraiser!

02:13.280 --> 02:16.080
A brand new tablet computer.

02:16.120 --> 02:17.520
Ahhhh... the possibilities

02:17.521 --> 02:18.920
are truly endless!

02:18.960 --> 02:20.480
But you know...

02:20.520 --> 02:22.320
ten boxes

02:22.321 --> 02:24.120
would really put me over.

02:24.160 --> 02:25.400
Alright. Dr. Dolores,

02:25.401 --> 02:26.640
I'm joining Vincent's team.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.040
I'll take one box!

02:28.080 --> 02:29.400
Me too.

02:29.440 --> 02:32.440
Ha! You guys are the best.

02:32.480 --> 02:34.020
I'm naming my first

02:34.021 --> 02:35.560
mathematical theory after you.

02:41.600 --> 02:43.960
Isn't that cute.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.180
As if they'll ever

02:45.181 --> 02:46.360
sell more than me.

02:48.760 --> 02:50.160
Okay guys,

02:50.200 --> 02:51.456
- let's sell
- some chocolate tablets!

02:51.480 --> 02:52.880
I mean, bars!

02:54.280 --> 02:55.960
Hey, wanna buy some chocolate?

02:56.000 --> 02:57.280
- Umm... no thanks.

02:57.281 --> 02:58.560
- Chocolate for sale!

02:58.600 --> 03:00.136
- Straight from
- the principal's office!

03:00.160 --> 03:01.600
Get your chocolate here!

03:02.680 --> 03:04.280
Okay guys...

03:04.320 --> 03:05.460
this is what we call

03:05.461 --> 03:06.600
"market saturation."

03:06.640 --> 03:07.760
At least we'll have

03:07.761 --> 03:08.880
plenty of yummy chocolate?

03:10.880 --> 03:12.760
Ugh.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.180
- Tastes like crayons.

03:14.181 --> 03:15.560
- We can't give up, guys.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.296
- We just have to
- get out of our comfort zone!

03:17.320 --> 03:18.800
What do you mean?

03:18.840 --> 03:20.176
- We'll sell door-to-door
- if we have to.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.560
We're going to win this thing.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.480
- For Vincent!
- For Vincent.

03:23.520 --> 03:25.800
For Vincent. I mean, for me!

03:26.680 --> 03:27.720
[tapping]

03:41.280 --> 03:42.760
- Grazie!
- Thanks!

04:16.399 --> 04:17.839
Did we win yet?

04:17.880 --> 04:19.100
Well...

04:19.101 --> 04:20.320
We've done remarkably well.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.200
- I don't see
- how we could possibly lose now!

04:22.240 --> 04:23.680
Thanks again, guys...

04:23.720 --> 04:25.360
- [Violetta] Keep packing
- those boxes!

04:25.400 --> 04:27.080
Still got plenty of room.

04:28.880 --> 04:30.160
Go! Go!

04:31.720 --> 04:33.400
Look at all that chocolate!

04:33.440 --> 04:35.280
What is she, opening a store?

04:35.320 --> 04:36.720
[Violetta] Now Daddy,

04:36.760 --> 04:38.280
- you told everyone
- at your company

04:38.320 --> 04:39.536
- That they have to
- buy my chocolates

04:39.560 --> 04:41.880
Or they're fired, right?

04:41.920 --> 04:43.800
Yay, you're the best daddy ever!

04:45.120 --> 04:47.560
Keep those boxes coming!

04:47.600 --> 04:49.040
Her dad's going to sell them?

04:49.920 --> 04:51.160
Figures.

04:51.200 --> 04:52.720
But that's against the rules!

04:52.760 --> 04:55.240
At least, it should be.

04:55.280 --> 04:56.880
[Paula] So what do we do?

04:56.920 --> 04:58.536
- I saw the camp ground teacher
- near by...

04:58.560 --> 04:59.840
We could tell him?

04:59.880 --> 05:01.080
We could snitch,

05:01.120 --> 05:02.760
but Violetta would just deny it.

05:04.960 --> 05:06.360
Okay, I have a plan.

05:06.361 --> 05:07.760
I need everyone in there

05:07.800 --> 05:09.840
- to come out here,
- in about five minutes, okay?

05:09.880 --> 05:11.736
- All the chocolate sellers
- and the camp ground teacher.

05:11.760 --> 05:12.780
You're going to tell

05:12.781 --> 05:13.800
on Violetta?

05:13.840 --> 05:15.560
[Mia] Not exactly.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.560
- I need you to tell everyone
- that Violetta's...

05:22.120 --> 05:23.700
Okay? Make sure Violetta's dad

05:23.701 --> 05:25.280
doesn't leave until I get back.

05:25.320 --> 05:27.280
I'll be right back!

05:27.320 --> 05:29.000
- Where's she going?
- Don't know.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.360
Let's just do what she asks...

05:30.400 --> 05:31.480
come on!

05:36.480 --> 05:37.560
It's a lot of work,

05:37.561 --> 05:38.640
having two lives.

05:40.080 --> 05:41.240
Hi Mia.

05:41.280 --> 05:42.600
Say your password.

05:42.640 --> 05:44.680
"Under the mask, under the moon,

05:44.720 --> 05:45.880
that's where

05:45.881 --> 05:47.040
what you seek is strewn."

06:00.280 --> 06:03.120
[screams]

06:07.640 --> 06:09.120
Woooooaaa!

06:12.400 --> 06:14.680
Oh. It's dark.

06:20.560 --> 06:22.200
Wow...

06:37.560 --> 06:38.600
[gasps]

06:53.040 --> 06:54.760
- [whispering] Aww.
- They're so cute.

06:54.800 --> 06:57.360
Maybe I'll just let them sleep.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.600
DING DING

06:59.400 --> 07:00.440
Mmm...

07:00.480 --> 07:01.720
who should I call first?

07:02.520 --> 07:03.800
Yuko.

07:43.200 --> 07:44.420
- Mo!

07:44.421 --> 07:45.640
- Aaaagh!

07:45.680 --> 07:47.440
Yuko... what are you doing up?

07:47.480 --> 07:48.736
- We are going out
- on the moonlight,

07:48.760 --> 07:50.480
- Aren't we?
- Uhhh...

07:50.520 --> 07:51.880
[gasps] You didn't forget

07:51.881 --> 07:53.240
about our special night,

07:53.280 --> 07:54.320
did you?

08:02.480 --> 08:05.000
Uhh... is it the full moon?

08:06.040 --> 08:08.200
Gee, I don't know, Yuko.

08:08.240 --> 08:10.120
- [Mo] I'm watching
- the palace guards...

08:10.160 --> 08:12.040
- They'll be running drills
- for hours.

08:12.080 --> 08:13.920
Woa... woa!

08:13.960 --> 08:15.320
What was that?

08:15.360 --> 08:16.600
Nothing. Just a bug.

08:16.601 --> 08:17.840
Come on,

08:17.880 --> 08:19.400
we haven't gone out

08:19.401 --> 08:20.920
in the full moon in so long!

08:22.240 --> 08:24.200
Okay, but just for a little bit.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.460
- Mia!

08:26.461 --> 08:27.720
- Hi Mo!

08:28.960 --> 08:31.200
Hey, where'd my butterfly go?

08:31.240 --> 08:33.880
Oh, was that your butterfly?

08:33.919 --> 08:36.120
- Sorry,
- I thought it was just a bug.

08:36.159 --> 08:37.600
This is a surprise, Mia.

08:39.760 --> 08:41.960
I just love Centopia at night!

08:42.960 --> 08:44.000
Gotcha!

08:44.039 --> 08:45.200
[Mia giggles]

08:45.240 --> 08:46.440
It's beautiful, isn't it?

08:46.480 --> 08:48.000
We were just talking about that.

08:48.040 --> 08:50.840
Yeah. The two of us were.

08:50.880 --> 08:51.880
Flying in the dark's

08:51.881 --> 08:52.881
a bit tricky, though.

08:52.920 --> 08:54.440
You get used to it.

08:54.480 --> 08:56.056
- Hey, maybe
- you should come with us...

08:56.080 --> 08:57.480
You heard her.

08:57.520 --> 08:59.120
- She doesn't like flying
- at night.

08:59.160 --> 09:00.816
- [Mia] I'd do it
- for a piece of the Trumptus.

09:00.840 --> 09:02.680
I've got a new Oracle:

09:02.720 --> 09:05.520
"Under the mask, under the moon,

09:05.560 --> 09:06.820
that's where

09:06.821 --> 09:08.080
what you seek is strewn."

09:08.120 --> 09:09.840
Under the mask...

09:09.880 --> 09:12.080
- I wonder
- if that means Panthea's mask?

09:12.120 --> 09:13.360
What about the moon?

09:13.400 --> 09:15.240
It's coming up, right there...

09:16.320 --> 09:17.400
Wow!

09:28.080 --> 09:29.680
Ugh...

09:29.720 --> 09:32.360
Yeah, that's our moon...

09:32.400 --> 09:34.360
- Let's look
- under Panthea's palace.

09:34.400 --> 09:35.920
"Under the mask" might mean

09:35.921 --> 09:37.440
it's in the canyons near there.

09:37.480 --> 09:39.640
That's dangerous territory.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.520
But they'll all be asleep.

09:41.560 --> 09:43.960
Hey, I've got a great idea.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.300
Why doesn't Mia stay here

09:45.301 --> 09:46.600
and oversee the guards

09:46.640 --> 09:48.440
- while we go
- find the Trumptus piece?!

09:48.480 --> 09:49.720
Huh?

09:49.760 --> 09:50.856
We don't want you to get hurt

09:50.880 --> 09:52.000
flying at night.

09:52.040 --> 09:53.480
Do you mind?

09:53.520 --> 09:55.280
- [Mo] It's really
- not that big of a deal.

09:55.320 --> 09:56.660
I just need somebody to

09:56.661 --> 09:58.000
make sure they don't slack off.

09:58.040 --> 10:00.280
Oh... It's okay.

10:00.320 --> 10:01.920
- I'll do it.
- [Yuko] Great!

10:01.960 --> 10:03.520
Come on, Mo! Our moon...

10:03.560 --> 10:05.480
- I mean,
- the Moon is rising...

10:13.800 --> 10:15.040
Well this isn't

10:15.041 --> 10:16.280
what I had in mind...

10:17.280 --> 10:18.320
[marching steps]

10:50.080 --> 10:51.560
Isn't this fun?

10:51.600 --> 10:53.040
Just you, me,

10:53.041 --> 10:54.480
and the full moon...

11:00.400 --> 11:02.400
I guess it has been a while.

11:06.240 --> 11:08.000
- [Yuko] We're going to
- need some light.

11:08.040 --> 11:09.840
- Come on...
- [giggles]

11:09.880 --> 11:11.520
Where are we going now?

11:11.560 --> 11:13.080
- [Yuko] Somewhere
- we haven't been

11:13.120 --> 11:14.760
In a long time...

11:16.400 --> 11:17.880
There they go.

11:17.920 --> 11:19.360
Hurry, Onchao.

11:19.400 --> 11:20.600
Don't lose them.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.840
- This isn't
- where they said they were going.

11:38.880 --> 11:39.920
[Yuko laughs]

11:42.880 --> 11:43.920
[Yuko laughs]

12:05.000 --> 12:06.040
[Yuko laughs]

12:07.280 --> 12:09.160
[blows]

12:09.200 --> 12:10.720
[laughing] Do you remember

12:10.721 --> 12:12.240
the first time we did this?

12:12.960 --> 12:14.160
[blows]

12:14.200 --> 12:15.400
Of course!

12:15.440 --> 12:17.040
Here's where we wrote our names!

12:19.440 --> 12:20.520
[Yuko] I barely knew

12:20.521 --> 12:21.600
how to write!

12:21.640 --> 12:23.560
I can do it so much better now!

12:30.640 --> 12:32.840
[Yuko] Mo and Yuko.

12:32.880 --> 12:34.760
The perfect team!

12:34.800 --> 12:35.840
[both laugh]

12:37.720 --> 12:39.140
I don't understand.

12:39.141 --> 12:40.560
Were they...

12:40.600 --> 12:42.520
- were they trying
- to get rid of me?

12:49.040 --> 12:50.440
Thanks Onchao!

12:50.480 --> 12:51.520
[neighs]

12:52.800 --> 12:54.200
What was that?

12:56.680 --> 12:58.120
[Mo] We should get going.

12:58.160 --> 12:59.656
- The moon will be pretty high
- by now.

12:59.680 --> 13:00.860
We don't want

13:00.861 --> 13:02.040
to miss our chance.

13:02.080 --> 13:03.920
[Yuko] It's nice to be out

13:03.921 --> 13:05.760
with just us two for once, huh?

13:05.800 --> 13:08.520
Yeah. I gotta admit, it is.

13:13.480 --> 13:14.760
I can't believe it.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.360
I thought...

13:16.400 --> 13:18.240
- I thought the three of us
- were a team.

13:18.280 --> 13:19.360
[neighs]

13:19.400 --> 13:20.840
Sorry, the four of us.

13:20.880 --> 13:22.600
You're part of the team too.

13:22.640 --> 13:24.080
[neighs]

13:24.120 --> 13:26.080
No. Just let them go.

13:26.120 --> 13:27.256
If they don't want me around,

13:27.280 --> 13:29.120
I'm just gonna go home.

13:29.160 --> 13:30.360
[snorts]

13:30.400 --> 13:31.600
I don't know.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.360
This oracle is a tough one.

13:33.400 --> 13:35.080
[neighs]

13:35.120 --> 13:36.300
That's true.

13:36.301 --> 13:37.480
It'd really show them

13:37.520 --> 13:38.560
if we found

13:38.561 --> 13:39.600
the Trumptus piece first.

13:39.640 --> 13:41.120
Some "perfect team" they are

13:41.160 --> 13:42.880
- if the two of us
- beat them to it.

13:42.920 --> 13:44.280
Let's do it!

14:00.520 --> 14:01.640
There could be muncs

14:01.641 --> 14:02.760
anywhere near here,

14:02.800 --> 14:04.240
so keep quiet.

14:10.440 --> 14:11.920
- Mo!
- SHHHH!

14:11.960 --> 14:13.200
What's that?!

14:17.680 --> 14:19.120
- Where?!
- There!

14:19.160 --> 14:20.680
I swear I saw something!

14:20.720 --> 14:22.000
Right down there.

14:22.040 --> 14:24.240
It looked like... A mask!

14:24.280 --> 14:25.800
Just like the Oracle said!

14:25.840 --> 14:27.240
Let's take a look.

14:32.640 --> 14:33.960
[yawns]

14:34.000 --> 14:36.200
I love the smell of vapors

14:36.240 --> 14:38.040
in the moon light!

14:38.080 --> 14:39.920
COME ON YOU LAZY DRAGON,

14:39.960 --> 14:42.200
time for night patrol!

14:45.880 --> 14:47.000
[Onchao snorts]

14:47.001 --> 14:48.121
I don't like it here either.

14:48.160 --> 14:49.280
But we can't let ourselves

14:49.281 --> 14:50.400
be scared.

14:54.040 --> 14:55.920
Can you sense anything?

14:55.960 --> 14:57.000
[snorts]

14:57.040 --> 14:58.840
[distant shrieking]

14:58.880 --> 15:00.176
- Coming out here
- on our own seemed

15:00.200 --> 15:02.040
Like a good idea at the time.

15:02.080 --> 15:04.200
Now... I gotta admit,

15:04.240 --> 15:05.280
I kinda wish

15:05.281 --> 15:06.320
Yuko and Mo were here.

15:09.360 --> 15:10.560
Come on.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.960
It was right here!

15:17.000 --> 15:18.520
Or... over there.

15:18.560 --> 15:20.160
Or maybe there.

15:20.200 --> 15:21.220
We just need the moon

15:21.221 --> 15:22.240
to come out again.

15:22.280 --> 15:24.040
[Yuko] Stupid clouds!

15:24.080 --> 15:25.520
Go block some other moon!

15:25.560 --> 15:27.720
- You were
- probably just seeing things.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.280
No, I wasn't!

15:29.320 --> 15:30.700
If Mia was here,

15:30.701 --> 15:32.080
she'd believe me.

15:32.120 --> 15:33.656
- You'll never find
- the Trumptus piece

15:33.680 --> 15:35.600
If we can't see this "mask".

15:35.640 --> 15:36.840
It could be anywhere.

15:36.880 --> 15:38.680
We can still look for it...

15:39.720 --> 15:40.920
[Yuko] Wait a minute...

15:40.960 --> 15:42.520
Isn't it odd for a tree

15:42.560 --> 15:43.920
to be growing all alone

15:43.921 --> 15:45.280
in this rock pile?

15:45.320 --> 15:46.520
[grunts with effort]

15:46.560 --> 15:47.880
It's pretty cool that a tree

15:47.920 --> 15:49.440
like that can survive out here

15:49.480 --> 15:50.920
in Munculus territory.

15:50.960 --> 15:52.720
- Well...
- it's got to mean something!

15:52.760 --> 15:54.040
So help me look for the trumptus

15:54.041 --> 15:55.320
piece already. [grunts]

15:55.360 --> 15:56.720
Those rocks

15:56.721 --> 15:58.080
don't look very stable.

15:58.120 --> 15:59.340
What? You think pulling

15:59.341 --> 16:00.560
on this little thing

16:00.600 --> 16:01.936
- is going to
- make the whole mountain

16:01.960 --> 16:03.160
Come down on us?

16:11.440 --> 16:12.800
What was that!?

16:17.320 --> 16:18.600
Hmmmmm...

16:18.640 --> 16:21.360
Tonight just got interesting!

16:21.400 --> 16:22.760
Dragon! You stay here

16:22.761 --> 16:24.120
and keep a look out.

16:24.160 --> 16:25.840
I'm going to check up ahead.

16:25.880 --> 16:26.960
HUH!?

16:27.000 --> 16:28.640
[snoring]

16:28.680 --> 16:32.160
Asleep on the job? Fine.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.720
Stay there... lazy lizard.

16:34.760 --> 16:35.960
You just can't find

16:35.961 --> 16:37.160
a good dragon these days...

16:37.200 --> 16:39.080
- if you
- want something done right...

16:39.120 --> 16:41.040
You have to do it yourself.

16:41.080 --> 16:42.120
[blows]

16:43.400 --> 16:45.000
Unnnh!

16:45.040 --> 16:46.800
- These rocks
- aren't going anywhere soon.

16:46.840 --> 16:47.920
[grunts with effort]

16:47.960 --> 16:49.400
This is all my fault.

16:49.440 --> 16:51.000
- How are we going to
- get out of here?

16:51.840 --> 16:52.960
- Mia.
- Mia.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.160
It's weird.

16:57.200 --> 16:58.340
You and I

16:58.341 --> 16:59.480
make such a good team...

16:59.520 --> 17:01.000
but if Mia were here,

17:01.040 --> 17:02.680
- maybe this
- wouldn't have happened.

17:02.720 --> 17:03.880
- Let's call her...
- DING!

17:14.680 --> 17:17.040
Tonight just got

17:17.040 --> 17:19.400
even more interesting!

17:19.440 --> 17:21.359
- I don't get it!
- They were just here!

17:21.400 --> 17:22.800
Where did they go?

17:22.839 --> 17:24.839
Onchao, do you see them?!

17:27.000 --> 17:28.079
DING DING!

17:28.119 --> 17:29.440
Mo.

17:36.240 --> 17:37.840
Why is it doing that?

17:47.880 --> 17:49.720
It's not glowing anymore.

17:49.760 --> 17:51.240
She wouldn't just give up!

17:51.280 --> 17:53.360
[gasps] Mo?! Yuko?!

17:53.400 --> 17:54.880
Can you hear me?!

17:54.920 --> 17:57.200
Shh! Listen!

17:57.240 --> 17:58.640
[Mia] Yuko?! Mo?!

17:58.680 --> 18:00.320
Mia?! It's Mia! Hey Mia!

18:00.360 --> 18:02.160
- We are down here!
- Mia! You've found us!

18:02.200 --> 18:04.280
- [Yuko] Help! Hello!
- [Mo] Mia! We're down here!

18:04.320 --> 18:06.280
[grunts] They're too heavy!

18:11.320 --> 18:13.120
Hey Onchao... Agh!

18:14.000 --> 18:15.200
[screams]

18:15.240 --> 18:17.640
Well, well, well...

18:17.680 --> 18:19.600
I wasted my time trying

18:19.640 --> 18:20.960
to catch

18:20.961 --> 18:22.280
the golden-horned unicorn.

18:22.320 --> 18:23.680
All I really had to do

18:23.681 --> 18:25.040
was sit back

18:25.080 --> 18:27.120
and wait until you

18:27.121 --> 18:29.160
brought it right to me.

18:29.200 --> 18:30.920
Come here...

18:30.960 --> 18:33.120
Gargona won't hurt you...

18:33.160 --> 18:34.400
Leave him alone!

18:34.440 --> 18:36.120
Tsss...

18:36.160 --> 18:37.880
Onchao! Run!

18:44.680 --> 18:48.040
Uuuuuu... aaaaaaaghh!

18:48.080 --> 18:49.240
Uuh...

18:49.280 --> 18:50.520
Ogh!

18:51.240 --> 18:52.280
[groans]

18:56.440 --> 18:58.080
Onchao! That little tree!

18:58.120 --> 18:59.400
You know what to do!

18:59.440 --> 19:00.680
[neighs]

19:08.360 --> 19:10.760
Whoaaa!!!

19:10.800 --> 19:13.720
Maaaah...

19:22.160 --> 19:23.760
[Yuko] Mia!

19:23.800 --> 19:25.440
Are you okay?

19:25.480 --> 19:26.960
You have no idea

19:26.961 --> 19:28.440
how happy we are to see you!

19:28.480 --> 19:29.560
Elf hug!

19:31.800 --> 19:33.600
[Gargona] How touching.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.680
Now get me down from here!

19:35.720 --> 19:37.620
I am General Gargona

19:37.621 --> 19:39.520
of the Munculus army.

19:39.560 --> 19:40.700
At least defeat me

19:40.701 --> 19:41.840
in a dignified way!

19:41.880 --> 19:44.600
[all laugh]

19:44.640 --> 19:45.640
Now if only the moon

19:45.641 --> 19:46.641
would show itself...

19:46.680 --> 19:48.120
I could prove to you

19:48.121 --> 19:49.560
that I wasn't seeing things!

19:49.600 --> 19:50.760
Mhmmm...

19:50.800 --> 19:52.800
Wait, I have an idea...

19:58.560 --> 20:00.560
[blows]

20:03.840 --> 20:05.100
Whoa!

20:05.101 --> 20:06.360
You weren't kidding, Yuko!

20:06.400 --> 20:08.320
"Under the mask, under the moon,

20:08.360 --> 20:10.200
- that's where what you seek
- is strewn."

20:10.240 --> 20:11.920
[neighs]

20:26.360 --> 20:27.480
[Mia] Yeeeah!

20:27.520 --> 20:28.680
I knew it!

20:38.240 --> 20:39.920
Hurry up, you guys.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.640
Mia...

20:47.680 --> 20:49.340
I have a confession to make.

20:49.341 --> 20:51.000
I... I...

20:51.040 --> 20:52.160
Tried to brush me off so you

20:52.161 --> 20:53.280
and Mo could have some time

20:53.320 --> 20:55.536
- with just the two of you,
- then went to a glow worm hollow

20:55.560 --> 20:57.520
- Without me and wrote
- your names on the walls?

20:57.560 --> 20:58.840
You know?

20:58.880 --> 21:00.960
I have a confession too.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.600
I... I...

21:02.640 --> 21:04.176
- Followed us
- and listened to our conversation

21:04.200 --> 21:05.496
- Then tried to find
- the Trumptus piece

21:05.520 --> 21:07.640
Without us so we'd feel bad?

21:07.680 --> 21:09.320
[Mia] You knew?

21:09.360 --> 21:11.440
[giggles] Just figured it out.

21:11.480 --> 21:13.040
We like having you around.

21:13.080 --> 21:14.880
I like being around.

21:14.920 --> 21:16.920
- We make a pretty good team,
- the four of us.

21:16.960 --> 21:18.720
[neighs]

21:18.760 --> 21:20.200
Come on! There's no one

21:20.201 --> 21:21.640
overseeing the palace guards

21:21.680 --> 21:23.600
- and making sure
- they don't fall asleep.

21:23.640 --> 21:24.880
Sure there is.

21:24.920 --> 21:26.360
I took care of it.

21:28.320 --> 21:30.200
[Phuddle] You there! Look smart!

21:30.240 --> 21:31.520
Eyes front!

21:31.560 --> 21:33.000
Get those knees up!

21:33.040 --> 21:34.520
Hut, two three four...

21:34.560 --> 21:36.480
hut, two three four...

21:36.520 --> 21:37.980
[Yuko] Mo, [laughs]

21:37.981 --> 21:39.440
I think you're out of a job...

21:39.480 --> 21:40.920
[Mia and Yuko laugh]

21:40.960 --> 21:42.560
- [Mia] Now,
- if you'll excuse me...

21:42.600 --> 21:44.360
- I have to go surprise
- somebody else...

21:44.400 --> 21:45.760
Bye everyone!

21:45.800 --> 21:47.080
- Bye-bye Mia!

21:47.081 --> 21:48.360
- Bye Mia!

21:48.400 --> 21:50.000
- [Phuddle] Now get
- those knees up!

21:50.040 --> 21:51.360
Actually... Phuddle's not doing

21:51.361 --> 21:52.680
such a bad job!

21:52.720 --> 21:53.760
[laughs] And he's

21:53.761 --> 21:54.800
better looking too!

21:54.840 --> 21:56.000
Yuko!!

21:56.040 --> 21:57.800
[both laugh]

22:01.680 --> 22:03.080
That was different.

22:05.560 --> 22:07.320
- How'd it go?
- I think it worked.

22:07.360 --> 22:08.840
But we're about to find out!

22:19.200 --> 22:20.420
[Mia] Gee, it sure

22:20.421 --> 22:21.640
is generous of Violetta's dad

22:21.680 --> 22:22.780
to drive everyone

22:22.781 --> 22:23.880
to the town square!

22:23.920 --> 22:24.960
What...?!

22:27.800 --> 22:30.056
- Thanks for being so responsible
- to keep an eye on the students

22:30.080 --> 22:31.280
While they're out on the town!

22:32.200 --> 22:33.320
Have fun kids!

22:35.400 --> 22:37.440
Violetta, aren't you joining in?

22:38.800 --> 22:42.000
I'll... Take a cab.

22:47.400 --> 22:48.480
You know guys,

22:48.481 --> 22:49.560
no matter what happens...

22:49.600 --> 22:51.880
I had fun with you today!

22:51.920 --> 22:53.060
But according to my figures

22:53.061 --> 22:54.200
we can't possibly lose!

22:54.240 --> 22:56.240
High five!
