00:00.400 --> 00:01.365
<i>Hi, I'm Chuck.</i>

00:01.400 --> 00:02.800
<i>Here's a few things that
you might need to know.</i>

00:02.835 --> 00:04.200
It was nice knowing you.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.365
Oh, my God. Bryce.

00:09.400 --> 00:10.600
How the hell are you still alive?

00:10.635 --> 00:11.665
It's complicated.

00:11.700 --> 00:13.200
You're still in love with me.

00:14.200 --> 00:16.500
I guess this means we're
not getting back together.

00:17.100 --> 00:18.465
We'll always have Omaha.

00:18.500 --> 00:20.465
what did bryce mean by omaha?

00:20.500 --> 00:22.800
Probably a code. Contact
point of some sort.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.200
<i>Bryce is going deep, Chuck.
No calls home, no messages out.</i>

00:26.300 --> 00:28.700
<i>If Sarah wants to join up
with him, she has to do it now.</i>

00:57.800 --> 00:59.200
What... what is that?

00:59.235 --> 01:00.600
What's that wiggly thing?

01:00.900 --> 01:02.200
What did I even bet on?

01:02.600 --> 01:04.300
Gimel! I win.

01:04.700 --> 01:06.000
- Aw...
- You sure?

01:06.035 --> 01:07.800
Yes. Yes.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.600
Gimel beats high. Pay up, buddy.

01:10.900 --> 01:12.665
I thought high was the best.

01:12.700 --> 01:14.265
Yes, I know you think so, but, Anna,

01:14.300 --> 01:16.065
this is the Parcheesi
of my people, all right?

01:16.100 --> 01:18.400
Don't question my spirituality.
Now hand over the cash.

01:18.435 --> 01:20.300
I apologize...

01:31.900 --> 01:33.900
Decided to take up bird watching?

01:35.200 --> 01:36.600
Just breathing in the view.

01:40.600 --> 01:41.800
I know that grunt.

01:41.900 --> 01:43.500
Yeah, that's the number seven, right?

01:43.535 --> 01:45.100
Skeptical with a side of cynicism.

01:45.135 --> 01:46.700
Just clearing my throat.

01:46.900 --> 01:47.765
Also couldn't help but notice,

01:47.800 --> 01:50.800
Agent Walker's car
isn't in her usual spot.

01:51.400 --> 01:53.565
Oh... I didn't, uh...

01:53.600 --> 01:55.000
It's weird, I didn't even notice.

01:55.035 --> 01:56.400
I didn't even see that, at all.

01:56.900 --> 01:58.300
Fine. Maybe I did.

01:58.500 --> 02:00.865
So, have you talked to Sarah lately?

02:00.900 --> 02:03.900
Agent Walker and I don't do a
lot of fraternizing off hours.

02:04.700 --> 02:06.600
Guess we'll just have to see.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.600
See... See what...
what-what... See what?

02:10.699 --> 02:12.800
See if she's had enough of
the good life here with you.

02:13.400 --> 02:14.565
See if she's hightailed it

02:14.600 --> 02:17.100
to wherever your buddy
Bryce is hiding himself.

02:18.100 --> 02:19.600
Is that, uh, is that an option?

02:19.635 --> 02:21.300
Oh, don't worry.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.000
I hear there's a great
selection of new handlers

02:24.035 --> 02:26.200
in this year's CIA Christmas catalogue.

02:26.400 --> 02:28.100
Are there? Thanks a lot.

02:30.100 --> 02:32.300
She's a liar, not to be trusted.

02:32.335 --> 02:33.500
- What's that?
- Women.

02:33.700 --> 02:35.565
Man, they're so elusive, so unknowable.

02:35.600 --> 02:37.865
Okay, they wrap you in
this wool sweater of lies

02:37.900 --> 02:40.200
and it keeps you warm, but
it makes your neck all itchy.

02:40.235 --> 02:41.967
Who-Who are we talking about exactly?

02:42.002 --> 02:43.700
Anna. And by the way,
never trust a woman

02:43.735 --> 02:45.467
who's name is a palindrome, okay?

02:45.502 --> 02:47.165
Uh, how do you know she's a liar?

02:47.200 --> 02:49.000
I waited outside her house
last night, in the bushes.

02:49.035 --> 02:50.700
I saw her get picked up to go out,

02:50.800 --> 02:53.500
then dropped off exactly three
hours and 24 minutes later.

02:53.535 --> 02:54.800
She's cheating on me.

02:55.200 --> 02:56.565
My Anna Banana is cheating on me.

02:56.600 --> 02:58.400
- In the bushes?
- I brought a sandwich.

02:58.435 --> 02:59.300
Oh...

02:59.600 --> 03:00.865
Listen, she's lying to me, okay?

03:00.900 --> 03:04.200
And a relationship is
built on trust, Chuck.

03:04.600 --> 03:07.000
Sex and trust, am I right?

03:07.600 --> 03:10.865
Yeah, yeah
- two big prerequisites, I guess.

03:10.900 --> 03:14.300
What's cool is you and Sarah
are so pure and simple, you know?

03:14.400 --> 03:17.300
You ever wish you were born
like a dog or a dolphin?

03:17.800 --> 03:19.000
Or Dr. Dre?

03:20.000 --> 03:21.400
Who's cheating on Dre, man?

03:21.435 --> 03:22.500
Chuckster.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.500
Uh, we got an install job
over at Marina Del Rey.

03:25.535 --> 03:27.465
Okay. Well, go with God, fellas.

03:27.500 --> 03:28.965
No, no, no. Big Mike says
you have to come with us,

03:29.000 --> 03:33.400
'cause you know that Jeff's not to be
left unsupervised around the holidays.

03:33.435 --> 03:35.000
Do you want to try my eggnog?

03:35.400 --> 03:36.465
- No.
- I'm sorry, fellas.

03:36.500 --> 03:39.000
Is it okay if you guys go
by yourself, okay? 'Cause...

03:39.200 --> 03:40.065
Anna's cheating on me.

03:40.100 --> 03:42.600
Ouch. Who's the lucky guy?

03:42.800 --> 03:44.465
Maybe it's not another guy.

03:44.500 --> 03:47.100
Okay, let's strap on our life
jackets and hit the Marina.

03:47.200 --> 03:48.500
See, that's why I've sworn off women.

03:49.100 --> 03:50.000
How'd you like to be that guy right now,

03:50.035 --> 03:52.600
all heartbroken over a lady?

03:53.300 --> 03:56.000
Bitches ain't nothing
but tricks and hos.

03:56.035 --> 03:57.200
You said it, bubeleh.

04:33.200 --> 04:35.600
Okay. Well, the system checks
out and everything's on line.

04:35.635 --> 04:36.865
Most onboard functions are

04:36.900 --> 04:39.100
now controllable from
anywhere on the boat.

04:39.135 --> 04:40.100
Nice ship.

04:40.600 --> 04:42.300
<i>It reminds me of the Pacific Princess.</i>

04:42.600 --> 04:44.700
- I'm not familiar.
- Oh, really?

04:44.900 --> 04:46.200
<i>The LoveBoat
- he's referring to The LoveBoat. Shh! Chuck, please!</i>

04:46.235 --> 04:47.165
shh, chuck, please.

04:47.200 --> 04:48.450
You got a head on board?

04:48.485 --> 04:49.665
I've had a lot of eggnog.

04:49.700 --> 04:51.565
Yeah, which you should've
left at home, Jeff.

04:51.600 --> 04:53.800
You know, not every boat you
get on is a booze cruise, buddy.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
The bathroom is not in there.

04:55.035 --> 04:56.017
Nobody downstairs!

04:56.052 --> 04:56.965
No, Jeff, wait...

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
- Hey!
- back, jeff, no.

04:58.035 --> 04:58.867
Whoa!

04:58.902 --> 04:59.665
Jackpot!

04:59.700 --> 05:01.500
Please, get out. Get out!

05:01.535 --> 05:02.665
Go! Go! Go!

05:02.700 --> 05:04.300
Watch this step. Watch the what? Oh.

05:05.100 --> 05:06.065
- What's with all the cash?
- Move.

05:06.100 --> 05:08.200
- Easy, sister...
- I'm not your sister.

05:08.800 --> 05:11.200
They're counting money raised
for Mr. Kirk's aid organization,

05:11.235 --> 05:12.317
from a charity event.

05:12.352 --> 05:13.400
Kirk? As in the captain?

05:13.600 --> 05:15.865
Lon Kirk, the man who owns this boat.

05:15.900 --> 05:17.900
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Lon Kirk
- he's a billionaire.

05:17.935 --> 05:20.200
He owns a country somewhere,
or something, right?

05:20.700 --> 05:21.900
Incoming.

05:23.600 --> 05:24.600
Oh...

05:31.100 --> 05:33.900
Ladies, I'm getting my sea legs.

05:34.000 --> 05:34.865
Okay, Jeff, Lester,

05:34.900 --> 05:37.000
I think, uh, we should go now.

05:37.035 --> 05:38.200
Sir, you dropped this...

05:47.900 --> 05:48.600
They're fake.

05:48.635 --> 05:49.265
Whatever.

05:49.300 --> 05:50.800
So is Cool Whip.

05:50.835 --> 05:52.265
Ahoy hoy.

05:56.085 --> 05:59.800
CHUCK S01E11

06:26.300 --> 06:28.400
<i>The serial numbers that Chuck flashed on</i>

06:28.435 --> 06:30.465
are a strain of counterfeit currency

06:30.500 --> 06:32.500
that Treasury has been
trying to crack for years.

06:32.535 --> 06:34.400
But perhaps we should
wait to debrief you

06:34.435 --> 06:36.517
until Agent Walker arrives.

06:36.552 --> 06:38.600
Yes. Where is Agent Walker?

06:38.700 --> 06:41.400
Uh, ma'am, Agent Walker is currently...

06:41.435 --> 06:42.465
She, uh...

06:42.500 --> 06:45.900
Agent Walker is currently
suffering from a spastic colon,

06:45.935 --> 06:47.700
which acts up on her
from time to time, so...

06:47.735 --> 06:49.500
She has no history of that.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.100
Perhaps we should reschedule when
Agent Walker is feeling better.

06:53.135 --> 06:56.000
I'm fine. I'm sorry I'm late. Carry on.

06:56.200 --> 06:57.200
As we were saying...

06:57.700 --> 07:00.000
Lon Kirk now devotes
most of his time and money

07:00.200 --> 07:01.750
to aid projects, mostly foreign.

07:01.785 --> 07:03.300
And we think he's the source?

07:03.335 --> 07:04.400
Not confirmed.

07:04.500 --> 07:06.900
However, we have intel that
a major counterfeiter is

07:06.935 --> 07:08.567
in Los Angeles trying to acquire

07:08.602 --> 07:10.201
a new set of printing plates.

07:10.236 --> 07:11.800
And how shall we proceed?

07:11.900 --> 07:15.200
As far as Kirk is
concerned, very cautiously.

07:15.235 --> 07:16.165
He's very well connected.

07:16.200 --> 07:18.200
He's hosting a charity event tonight

07:18.235 --> 07:20.117
at the New Constellation Yacht Club.

07:20.152 --> 07:22.000
Sarah and Chuck will go as guests.

07:22.300 --> 07:23.400
Casey as staff.

07:23.435 --> 07:24.500
One question:

07:25.500 --> 07:27.300
Will Chuck and Sarah
be going as a couple?

07:27.500 --> 07:28.800
Unless they have a problem.

07:28.835 --> 07:29.900
No problem.

07:32.700 --> 07:33.600
No problem.

07:33.635 --> 07:34.500
Good luck then.

07:39.900 --> 07:42.000
Hey, hey, Sarah. Wait.

07:42.800 --> 07:43.600
What's up?

07:43.635 --> 07:44.500
Um...

07:45.700 --> 07:46.500
Nothing.

07:47.300 --> 07:47.965
Nothing, really.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.500
Just, you know, good
to, good to see you.

07:51.300 --> 07:53.300
Thought you'd be
halfway to Bryce by now.

07:54.700 --> 07:56.200
Why would you think that?

07:58.400 --> 08:00.200
I don't know, 'cause...

08:01.400 --> 08:03.950
he offers a pretty
exciting life, I guess,

08:03.985 --> 08:06.500
sipping Mai Tai's in
Jakarta, or... or...

08:07.300 --> 08:09.065
assassinating Afghani warlords,

08:09.100 --> 08:11.100
or whatever it is that
you kids do for fun.

08:11.135 --> 08:13.600
I'm here because I have a job to do.

08:15.600 --> 08:16.400
Right.

08:17.400 --> 08:18.800
Right. Of course, the job.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.600
I better, uh, I better
get going as well.

08:22.635 --> 08:23.700
I gotta punch in.

08:25.700 --> 08:26.500
Sarah?

08:26.800 --> 08:27.500
Yeah?

08:35.000 --> 08:37.500
Should we, should we
carpool on our date tonight?

08:38.100 --> 08:39.600
Be at my place at 8:00.

08:51.600 --> 08:53.200
For those of you who are unaware,

08:53.900 --> 08:56.900
this Friday is our annual
Buy More Christmas...

08:56.935 --> 08:57.800
Hup!

09:00.500 --> 09:02.865
<i>...holiday party,</i>

09:02.900 --> 09:05.600
with respect to our Hebrew friends

09:05.635 --> 09:08.300
and whatever else we have here.

09:08.600 --> 09:10.100
So there's no confusion,

09:10.700 --> 09:12.600
I'll go over the ground rules.

09:13.800 --> 09:15.000
Rule number one:

09:16.500 --> 09:20.200
Jeff, no spiking the eggnog.

09:20.700 --> 09:22.400
- Can I bring my own?
- No!

09:22.700 --> 09:25.700
Rule number two: Jeff,
no holding the mistletoe

09:25.735 --> 09:28.000
over the women and copping a feel.

09:28.100 --> 09:29.665
Uh, sir, hopefully,

09:29.700 --> 09:32.100
if Jeff follows rule number one
- which I'm sure...

09:34.000 --> 09:37.800
...he might do
- uh, then rule number two won't apply.

09:38.700 --> 09:39.265
Good point.

09:39.300 --> 09:40.800
Okay, who's bringing eats?

09:41.400 --> 09:43.400
Uh, I'll be making latkes.

09:43.435 --> 09:45.065
What's that?

09:45.100 --> 09:48.700
Um, the traditional Jewish pancake.

09:48.800 --> 09:51.100
- They got 'tater in them?
- Yes.

09:51.135 --> 09:53.400
- They fried?
- They are, sir.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.500
Good. Meeting adjourned!

09:57.100 --> 09:58.700
We got to find out how to make latkes.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.400
Hey, there you are.

10:06.600 --> 10:07.465
You missed the meeting.

10:07.500 --> 10:09.300
Jeff has to stay sober
and he can't grope women.

10:09.335 --> 10:11.500
- I know the drill.
- Okay.

10:13.200 --> 10:14.600
If you don't tell me what's up,

10:15.200 --> 10:17.150
I'm going to tickle you until you pee.

10:17.185 --> 10:19.100
Please... I don't, I don't want...

10:19.135 --> 10:20.200
Cut it out. Stop it.

10:20.500 --> 10:21.400
I know, okay.

10:21.600 --> 10:22.950
You weren't home last night, Anna.

10:22.985 --> 10:24.265
You went out. I was in the bushes

10:24.300 --> 10:26.600
at a stakeout with
my iPod and corn beef.

10:27.300 --> 10:28.800
Yeah, I know, it's a little weird, okay?

10:28.900 --> 10:30.200
But I saw you get picked up.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.000
I'm not an idiot, all right?

10:32.300 --> 10:34.700
At least, not when it comes to this.

10:36.500 --> 10:38.300
I'm sorry, Morgan.

10:38.500 --> 10:40.000
I did lie.

10:40.400 --> 10:41.500
Oh, my God...

10:42.000 --> 10:43.400
I think I'm going to be nauseous.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.600
But I'm not seeing someone else.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.865
Please, I saw you get into
the guy's German luxury sedan.

10:51.900 --> 10:54.500
It's bad enough that you're cheating, but
did it have to be with someone so successful?

10:54.535 --> 10:55.500
Morgan...

10:56.000 --> 10:57.600
my parents are in town.

10:57.635 --> 10:59.200
That was my dad's car.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.200
Wait a minute, I thought
your parents lived in Taiwan.

11:01.235 --> 11:02.965
They do... mostly.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.400
They're just in town with a
bunch of Taiwanese government

11:05.435 --> 11:07.900
muckety-mucks for a
charity thing in L.A.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.500
Well, then, I'd like to
meet your parents, all right?

11:09.535 --> 11:10.800
And I think if you're serious
about this relationship,

11:10.835 --> 11:12.400
you should want me to meet them, too.

11:15.600 --> 11:16.600
Okay.

11:18.400 --> 11:19.400
Okay.

11:22.500 --> 11:23.200
Hey!

11:24.200 --> 11:25.765
Would you stop sneaking
up on me like that?

11:25.800 --> 11:28.200
This is a retail store,
okay, buddy, not Tora Bora.

11:28.235 --> 11:30.400
Oh, Sarah's got you all up in a tizzy.

11:31.100 --> 11:32.600
Flush out your headgear, new guy.

11:32.635 --> 11:33.665
We both know the Intersect

11:33.700 --> 11:35.900
needs as much room up
there as we can get.

11:35.935 --> 11:38.065
Okay, look, nothing is going on, okay?

11:38.100 --> 11:39.800
Better not be. I need
your "A" game tonight.

11:39.835 --> 11:40.900
Stay sharp.

11:42.100 --> 11:43.700
Dude, I think I need your help here.

11:43.735 --> 11:45.300
I think I made a horrible mistake.

11:45.700 --> 11:46.800
What did you swallow this time?

11:46.835 --> 11:48.400
No, no, it's worse. Worse.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.065
Anna's parents are in town, right?

11:50.100 --> 11:51.900
So I tell her, "Hey,
I'd like to meet them. "

11:51.935 --> 11:53.100
So she goes, "Okay. "

11:53.500 --> 11:54.600
Are you kidding me? What was I thinking?

11:54.635 --> 11:56.200
My own parents don't even like me.

11:56.900 --> 11:57.665
We're similar.

11:57.700 --> 11:59.165
Morgan, Morgan, relax, buddy.

11:59.200 --> 12:00.465
It's going to be fine. Just be yourself.

12:00.500 --> 12:03.000
That's what Anna likes,
right? So will her parents.

12:03.600 --> 12:04.065
Yeah.

12:04.100 --> 12:06.700
- Right, you're right; that's what I'm going to do.
- Are you insane?

12:07.100 --> 12:08.400
You can't be yourself.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.700
You have to be better than yourself.

12:10.735 --> 12:12.700
By, like, a factor of ten.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.300
Or eleven.

12:16.500 --> 12:17.400
I got to take it up a notch.

12:17.435 --> 12:18.265
I got to step it up.

12:18.300 --> 12:19.965
- Who should I be?
- Last I checked,

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
there were over, like, six
billion people on the planet.

12:22.035 --> 12:23.500
Pick anyone.

12:23.900 --> 12:24.900
Should be an improvement.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.600
lester, you shut up. morgan,

12:26.635 --> 12:28.165
You, relax.

12:28.200 --> 12:29.400
You're going to be fine.

12:30.100 --> 12:31.200
Be myself.

12:31.500 --> 12:32.200
Rock and roll.

12:32.900 --> 12:34.400
I'm going to make a fool of myself.

12:46.700 --> 12:47.800
It's open!

13:01.900 --> 13:03.500
Not a morning person, I see.

13:04.300 --> 13:05.700
Well, it depends on the morning.

13:06.100 --> 13:07.165
So we're clear on everything?

13:07.200 --> 13:09.900
Eyes and ears on anything
that can trigger a flash.

13:10.200 --> 13:11.900
Our cover is that we're
a couple, you're...

13:11.935 --> 13:13.067
Charles Carmichael.

13:13.102 --> 13:14.200
Yeah, I got it.

13:16.400 --> 13:17.800
It should be pretty fun, right?

13:18.600 --> 13:19.500
It's work.

13:23.100 --> 13:24.700
That's okay. I got it.

13:25.200 --> 13:26.400
Okay, well, uh...

13:26.500 --> 13:27.700
ready to go to work?

13:46.100 --> 13:48.000
If you're expecting me to hit
the tables tonight, I'm gonna need

13:48.035 --> 13:50.500
a no-interest spy loan
or something like that.

13:50.535 --> 13:51.867
You'd be shocked what a government

13:51.902 --> 13:53.165
super-computer pays these days.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.200
The CIA staked us. You have a hundred.

13:55.235 --> 13:57.100
Oh, well, that's ample.

13:57.800 --> 13:59.100
Since when do you drink martinis?

13:59.135 --> 14:00.165
Oh, oh, I don't, no.

14:00.200 --> 14:01.600
But Carmichael loves them.

14:03.800 --> 14:04.900
There he is. Let's go.

14:10.500 --> 14:12.100
Ah! Roulette, eh?

14:12.300 --> 14:14.800
My favorite game aside
from "Call of Duty. "

14:15.200 --> 14:16.200
Chips, please.

14:16.700 --> 14:17.900
100, sir.

14:18.000 --> 14:18.800
Good luck.

14:19.300 --> 14:20.500
Don't lose it.

14:21.400 --> 14:23.700
I don't believe we've
met before. I'm Lon Kirk.

14:23.735 --> 14:25.700
I'm the host of this evening's event.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.300
I know the people of Taiwan
are deeply appreciative

14:28.335 --> 14:30.267
- of your generosity.
- Oh, well, cheers.

14:30.302 --> 14:32.200
The name's Carmichael.
Charles Carmichael.

14:32.235 --> 14:34.500
Pleasure, and your stunning...

14:35.700 --> 14:36.500
...companion?

14:37.600 --> 14:39.200
Sarah Walker. Pleasure.

14:40.100 --> 14:42.500
- May I ask, Mr. Kirk...
- Lon, please.

14:42.535 --> 14:44.465
Lon, I was wondering

14:44.500 --> 14:46.000
how you came to focus your

14:46.035 --> 14:47.465
charitable efforts on Taiwan.

14:47.500 --> 14:49.950
Well, I started doing business there,

14:49.985 --> 14:52.400
and I just fell in
love with the people-

14:52.500 --> 14:55.200
their indefatigable spirit
- and I said to myself...

14:55.235 --> 14:57.417
- Three and nine, please.
- Yes, sir.

14:57.452 --> 14:59.600
I said to myself, "Lon, you can help. "

14:59.635 --> 15:00.900
That's wonderful.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.365
And I always bet on red

15:02.400 --> 15:03.565
because it reminds me of all

15:03.600 --> 15:05.100
the pain and suffering in the world.

15:05.135 --> 15:06.300
How noble.

15:06.500 --> 15:08.400
- Any other
bets? - Mm-hmm!

15:08.435 --> 15:09.600
Mm-hmm.

15:09.800 --> 15:11.700
I'm in. All of it.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.400
"Always bet on black. "

15:16.100 --> 15:17.650
<i>Wesley Snipes, Passenger 57.</i>

15:17.685 --> 15:19.165
Not a great film, granted.

15:19.200 --> 15:20.900
You sure you want to risk it all, sir?

15:21.500 --> 15:22.300
You might want to reconsider.

15:22.335 --> 15:23.300
Doesn't seem prudent.

15:23.335 --> 15:24.400
Prudent?

15:25.400 --> 15:27.200
I mean, here I thought
we were gambling, right?

15:27.235 --> 15:29.000
Plus, if I lose it, it
goes to charity anyway.

15:29.035 --> 15:30.400
So here's to losing, right?

15:30.600 --> 15:31.600
- Cheers.
- Bets are in.

15:31.635 --> 15:33.700
$100,000 on black.

15:35.600 --> 15:36.565
What?! $100,000?

15:36.600 --> 15:37.800
Is that what you just said?

15:38.100 --> 15:40.600
Uh, no, no, no, no, wait,
wait wait- I didn't realize-

15:40.635 --> 15:42.800
it's a normal bet for me, $100,000.

15:42.835 --> 15:44.100
Come on, black.

15:44.500 --> 15:45.600
Black, black, black, black.

15:46.600 --> 15:48.200
Come on, honey, cheer for black.

15:51.100 --> 15:51.900
Three, red.

15:52.800 --> 15:54.000
Do you guys do mulligans in roulette?

15:54.035 --> 15:55.667
Or any kind of a do-over?

15:55.702 --> 15:57.300
Is there, like, a thing...

16:00.600 --> 16:01.700
If you'll excuse me.

16:04.700 --> 16:06.200
Did you really just wink at him?

16:06.235 --> 16:07.700
Did you really just lose $100,000?

16:07.735 --> 16:08.700
Psst.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.165
Kirk is talking to Rashan Chen.

16:19.200 --> 16:21.300
He's the Taiwanese Attaché|to
the Premier, he's dirty.

16:21.335 --> 16:22.600
They're using the charity as a front

16:22.635 --> 16:24.300
to launder counterfeit money.

16:25.100 --> 16:26.700
Okay, something's wrong.
I'm going to go over.

16:26.735 --> 16:28.000
Chuck, you stay at the table.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.000
We'll work on a payment plan later.

16:32.300 --> 16:33.000
Can we.

16:37.100 --> 16:38.400
She's being a little
obvious, don't you think?

16:38.435 --> 16:47.400
Relax, Chuck, she's just doing her job.

16:47.435 --> 16:49.400
So, uh, what did, uh...

16:49.500 --> 16:50.765
what did you and Kirk talk about?

16:50.800 --> 16:53.200
Uh, he invited me to his
yacht tomorrow afternoon.

16:54.400 --> 16:55.800
Okay, what time should I be ready?

16:56.400 --> 16:57.600
No, just me.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.150
Oh, just, just you.

17:01.185 --> 17:02.700
Alone on his yacht.

17:05.900 --> 17:08.300
Kind of disrespectful to your
boyfriend, don't you think?

17:08.335 --> 17:09.665
Chuck, Bryce is not my boyfriend.

17:09.700 --> 17:12.200
And even if he was, he'd
understand this kind of work.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.500
I meant Carmichael...

17:15.500 --> 17:16.300
actually.

17:18.700 --> 17:21.599
But don't worry, Carmichael's
booked up tomorrow anyway.

17:21.700 --> 17:24.599
Very, very busy schedule, so...

17:26.000 --> 17:27.700
good luck and...

17:27.734 --> 17:28.600
good night.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Nice car.

18:23.300 --> 18:24.500
Not just any car.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.600
It's a 1985 Crown Victoria.

18:28.600 --> 18:29.165
But, like a lady,

18:29.200 --> 18:31.300
she doesn't like it when
I talk about her age.

18:31.335 --> 18:33.400
I'm not really a car
guy, so I don't really...

18:33.700 --> 18:34.900
Pretty, pretty shiny, though.

18:34.935 --> 18:36.200
Oh, yeah, she's shiny.

18:36.700 --> 18:38.465
4.6 V8 engine,

18:38.500 --> 18:40.165
hydra glide transmission,

18:40.200 --> 18:42.500
reupholstered the
prisoner containment area.

18:42.600 --> 18:43.865
Even installed a state of the art

18:43.900 --> 18:46.200
GPS tracking system
in the license plate.

18:46.700 --> 18:47.665
Can locate this baby anywhere

18:47.700 --> 18:49.500
in the world in less than a minute.

18:49.900 --> 18:50.565
It's great.

18:50.600 --> 18:52.165
Th-that's really, Casey.

18:52.200 --> 18:53.900
Could buy ten more just
like her with the money

18:53.935 --> 18:55.665
you pissed away on one spin last night.

18:55.700 --> 18:58.100
I knew you weren't going to let
that go. How did I know that?

19:00.000 --> 19:01.365
So what, exactly, is Sarah's

19:01.400 --> 19:03.200
mission on that guy's boat today?

19:06.200 --> 19:07.700
Get close to Lon Kirk.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.200
By any means necessary.

19:11.600 --> 19:12.800
Wait, are...

19:13.500 --> 19:16.400
You're saying she's going
to go down there and flirt

19:16.800 --> 19:18.500
with Lon Kirk alone?

19:19.700 --> 19:23.500
I mean, do you have any idea
what kind of message that gives?

19:24.700 --> 19:27.000
Hmm... and I hear Agent
Walker can be quite the giver.

19:41.400 --> 19:42.800
Do me a favor and keep it up front.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.400
So, Morgan...

19:54.000 --> 19:54.965
you work at Buy More?

19:55.000 --> 19:56.600
Yes, sir. Yes, sir, that's correct.

19:56.635 --> 19:58.167
And Anna will tell you that I got

19:58.202 --> 19:59.700
the old nose to the grindstone.

19:59.800 --> 20:01.100
You know, not literally.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.000
Of course, because that would hurt.

20:03.200 --> 20:06.400
And is that where you see
yourself in say, five years?

20:06.435 --> 20:07.700
That's a tough question.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.000
I could tell you where I don't

20:10.035 --> 20:11.600
want to see myself in five years:

20:12.500 --> 20:14.900
prison, or under house arrest.

20:15.200 --> 20:17.550
Do anything that involves a lot

20:17.585 --> 20:19.900
of chopping, deep knee bends.

20:20.600 --> 20:21.165
No nudity.

20:21.200 --> 20:23.000
Waiter... Cocktail.

20:23.300 --> 20:26.000
Just generally try
to keep my clothes on.

20:26.035 --> 20:27.200
You know, it's...

20:29.200 --> 20:30.400
<i>Are you insane?</i>

20:30.900 --> 20:31.965
You can't be yourself.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.200
You have to be better than yourself.

20:34.235 --> 20:35.600
Are you guys having lobster?

20:35.900 --> 20:37.500
Could you bring back a doggie bag?

20:38.000 --> 20:39.100
All right, take it off, take it off.

20:39.135 --> 20:40.300
Be better. Got to be better.

20:40.335 --> 20:42.100
Where am I from?

20:42.900 --> 20:43.800
Whew... Wow.

20:43.900 --> 20:45.700
Where are any of us really from?

20:45.735 --> 20:47.817
I myself hail from many fathers.

20:47.852 --> 20:49.865
Nietzsche, Sartre, Jor-El...

20:49.900 --> 20:52.000
He's... Encino. He's from Encino.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.400
There I was... there I was,

20:55.500 --> 20:57.600
there... I... was...

20:57.700 --> 20:59.100
in the Congo.

20:59.400 --> 21:01.100
When you guys eat Chinese food

21:01.300 --> 21:03.300
do you get hungry a hour later, too?

21:05.500 --> 21:06.400
There she goes.

21:07.200 --> 21:08.200
You don't mind, do you, babe?

21:08.400 --> 21:10.100
You know who else
famously smoked a pipe?

21:10.500 --> 21:11.700
Boyhood hero of mine.

21:12.100 --> 21:14.000
Yeah, yeah, quite the yachtsman himself.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.600
OnePopeye the Sailor Man.

21:17.100 --> 21:18.200

21:38.700 --> 21:39.165
Hey, Morgan.

21:39.200 --> 21:41.600
Yeah, hey, hey, dude, we got
a possible situation here.

21:41.635 --> 21:43.517
I'm out lunching with Anna's Parents

21:43.552 --> 21:45.400
at some fancy yacht club in the Marina.

21:45.435 --> 21:46.465
Okay, when who do I see,

21:46.500 --> 21:49.100
but someone who resembles the
future Mrs. Chuck Bartowski.

21:49.135 --> 21:51.200
All right, now she's getting lotioned up

21:51.235 --> 21:53.665
by some creepy Richard Branson

21:53.700 --> 21:55.600
<i>meets Willem Dafoe
- lookin' dude, right?</i>

21:55.635 --> 21:58.165
<i>And he is all over her, man.</i>

21:58.200 --> 22:01.400
<i>I mean, he is really greasing
her and working up this lather.</i>

22:01.435 --> 22:04.267
I mean, it's just, it's,
uh, quite a scene over here.

22:04.302 --> 22:07.100
And, um, hey, listen, I got
to go, man, lobster here.

22:19.200 --> 22:20.600
Hey, oh, hey, hey, hey, hey!

22:20.635 --> 22:22.000
Don't shoot. Put the gun down.

22:22.200 --> 22:23.365
You can have the jelly-filled.

22:23.400 --> 22:24.800
What are you doing here, Bartowski?

22:24.900 --> 22:26.400
Thought you might be hungry, you know.

22:26.800 --> 22:28.600
Friend to friend kind of a thing.

22:29.000 --> 22:29.465
Where's Sarah?

22:29.500 --> 22:30.765
Oh, that's it. You think

22:30.800 --> 22:32.265
your girlfriend's stepping out on you.

22:32.300 --> 22:35.100
Agent Walker is fine
and doing her job, see?

22:37.400 --> 22:39.900
Plus, we have a whole team here

22:40.200 --> 22:42.300
to back her up, okay?

22:42.900 --> 22:44.300
So you can beat it, Bartowski.

22:46.100 --> 22:47.200
Oh, my God, they're going down.

22:56.800 --> 22:57.665
chuck, What is it?

22:57.700 --> 23:00.150
They're loading counterfeit
plates onto the boat.

23:00.185 --> 23:02.600
They're hidden in crates
marked as aid medicines.

23:02.635 --> 23:03.300
What?

23:04.000 --> 23:05.300
Yeah, I just flashed on a crate

23:05.335 --> 23:05.965
they just brought onboard.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.900
That's why Kirk just
brought Sarah below deck.

23:07.935 --> 23:09.117
This guy's important, Chuck.

23:09.152 --> 23:10.626
We can't be wrong. You sure?

23:10.661 --> 23:12.100
I just flashed. I'm sure, okay?

23:14.300 --> 23:15.300
This is Casey.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.800
We're going in... Go.

23:24.400 --> 23:25.700
Federal agents. Nobody move!

23:28.900 --> 23:30.000
Excuse me for a moment.

23:36.200 --> 23:37.300
Who are you people?

23:37.600 --> 23:38.165
NSA.

23:38.200 --> 23:40.400
- Stay right there. Let us do our job.
- Your job?

23:40.435 --> 23:42.467
- Do you have any idea who I am?
- Open it.

23:42.502 --> 23:44.500
That crate is a bonded
humanitarian shipment

23:44.535 --> 23:46.665
certified by the United Nations.

23:46.700 --> 23:48.065
It's illegal for any of you to open it.

23:48.100 --> 23:50.200
Oh, I can make some phone calls.
Hope you don't mind waiting.

23:50.235 --> 23:52.100
Oh, I do, so we won't.

23:55.300 --> 23:56.300
Medical supplies.

23:57.300 --> 23:58.600
For the earthquake victims of Taiwan.

23:58.635 --> 24:00.200
I wanted to deliver it myself.

24:00.400 --> 24:01.400
We leave tomorrow.

24:03.300 --> 24:04.065
Now, if I could get

24:04.100 --> 24:05.550
your names and agency affiliations,

24:05.585 --> 24:07.292
I want to make sure that everybody

24:07.327 --> 24:09.263
is properly accounted for when I speak

24:09.298 --> 24:11.200
to your bosses' bosses
later this evening.

24:17.300 --> 24:18.500
Ellie or Awesome home?

24:18.800 --> 24:20.350
No. They're at work.

24:20.385 --> 24:21.865
And hello to you, too.

24:21.900 --> 24:23.100
What the hell happened today?

24:23.900 --> 24:25.100
I
- I don't know. I don't get it.

24:25.135 --> 24:26.200
I had a flash.

24:26.400 --> 24:27.865
Right when I went below deck with Kirk.

24:27.900 --> 24:30.400
- It's pretty convenient timing, I would say.
- What are you talking about?

24:30.435 --> 24:32.400
Just when you thought that I
was getting intimate with Kirk,

24:32.435 --> 24:33.717
you decided to have a flash.

24:33.752 --> 24:34.965
What exactly are you implying?

24:35.000 --> 24:36.700
That I faked the flash?
That I'm a flash faker?

24:36.735 --> 24:38.667
You know, I think we
need to discuss the fact

24:38.702 --> 24:40.600
that you let your emotions
get in the way today.

24:40.800 --> 24:41.900
<i>My emotions?</i>

24:42.300 --> 24:44.965
Things have been a little
off since the incident, Chuck.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.100
Really? And what incident are you
referring to, Agent Walker, huh?

24:48.300 --> 24:49.865
Could it be the incident
where you planted a kiss

24:49.900 --> 24:53.400
on me right before a bomb was
supposed to go off, ending our lives?

24:53.500 --> 24:55.500
That same kiss right before
your boyfriend, Bryce,

24:55.535 --> 24:56.900
came back from the dead, that kiss?

24:56.935 --> 24:58.117
Stop saying kiss. It happened.

24:58.152 --> 24:59.265
Okay? What's done is done.

24:59.300 --> 25:00.900
Can we just not talk about it, please?

25:00.935 --> 25:02.367
Okay, fine. Absolutely, of course.

25:02.402 --> 25:03.701
Just answer me one little thing.

25:03.736 --> 25:04.965
Chuck... Did you kiss me that night

25:05.000 --> 25:06.065
because you thought
we were going to die,

25:06.100 --> 25:08.000
and mine were the most
convenient lips around,

25:08.100 --> 25:09.800
or was it actually about me?

25:12.600 --> 25:14.000
What happened was a mistake.

25:16.100 --> 25:17.300
One I won't make again.

25:38.600 --> 25:41.000
Well, well, well!

25:42.500 --> 25:43.765
Lookin' good, Morgan.

25:43.800 --> 25:45.800
Well, feelin' good, Charles.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.500
And how was, uh, meeting Anna's parents?

25:48.535 --> 25:50.165
Uh, it was... it was fine.

25:50.200 --> 25:52.000
You know, I think it went, uh, okay...

25:55.100 --> 25:56.000
...ish.

25:56.100 --> 25:57.165
Let's just say he wasn't

25:57.200 --> 26:00.000
the Morgan we've all
come to know and love.

26:02.600 --> 26:04.465
- Hey, Captain Steubing!
- Morning, Michael.

26:04.500 --> 26:05.800
You know, I was I thinking
about focusing my energy

26:05.835 --> 26:07.265
on the starboard side
of the store today.

26:07.300 --> 26:09.800
You don't change into some
regulation clothing right now,

26:09.835 --> 26:11.900
I'm gonna kick the
starboard side of your ass.

26:12.800 --> 26:14.065
Why do people hate the rich?

26:14.100 --> 26:15.300
Hey, listen, speaking of starboard,

26:15.700 --> 26:17.500
uh, Anna's parents invited us,

26:17.535 --> 26:19.265
or at least Anna, on a cruise

26:19.300 --> 26:20.800
with some of their
big-shot Taiwanese friends.

26:20.835 --> 26:22.700
You and Sarah should join us.

26:22.800 --> 26:24.365
Supposed to be some
bigwig diplomats there.

26:24.400 --> 26:26.600
You and Sarah should be hanging
out with diplomats, Chuck.

26:27.900 --> 26:29.965
Oh. Or just you.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.400
Right. I'm sorry, dude.

26:31.700 --> 26:33.300
Did you find out that
was Sarah yesterday?

26:33.600 --> 26:34.600
Yeah. Yeah.

26:35.600 --> 26:36.500
Yeah, that wasn't her.

26:37.200 --> 26:41.400
Must have been some other
busty, long-legged blonde.

26:41.500 --> 26:43.000
They're a dime a dozen around here.

26:43.500 --> 26:44.765
Figured it wasn't her, you know?

26:44.800 --> 26:46.500
And to be honest with you,
I wasn't looking at her face.

26:47.500 --> 26:49.200
Well, boat later, huh?

26:49.300 --> 26:50.700
You? Me?

26:50.800 --> 26:52.100
Shrimp cocktail's supposed to be served.

26:52.600 --> 26:53.900
Thanks, buddy, but, uh,

26:54.000 --> 26:55.600
I think I'm going to
stay landlocked tonight.

26:55.635 --> 26:57.900
Oh, well, suit yourself. Ahoy hoy.

26:59.200 --> 27:02.300
<i>Which part of handle Lon Kirk
with caution wasn't clear,</i>

27:02.400 --> 27:03.700
Agents Walker and Casey?

27:03.735 --> 27:05.000
Chuck flashed, General.

27:05.500 --> 27:07.500
Our decision to raid the boat
was based on the information

27:07.535 --> 27:09.000
we received from the Intersect.

27:09.035 --> 27:10.500
Except Chuck was wrong.

27:10.900 --> 27:13.900
We think Kirk must have managed
to hide the plates somehow.

27:14.100 --> 27:14.900
Where?

27:16.900 --> 27:17.265
We don't know.

27:17.300 --> 27:18.600
So, you moved in anyway?

27:19.100 --> 27:20.800
Is there something that
might have caused Chuck

27:20.835 --> 27:22.767
to think those plates
were on Kirk's boat?

27:22.802 --> 27:24.700
Anything that might
have caused his flash?

27:27.000 --> 27:28.300
Not that we're aware of.

27:28.700 --> 27:31.300
I don't want the two of you
anywhere near Kirk from now on.

27:31.600 --> 27:33.200
Both of us? But he doesn't suspect me.

27:33.235 --> 27:34.467
We don't know that,

27:34.502 --> 27:35.665
and we can't risk it.

27:35.700 --> 27:39.400
So until further notice,
consider yourselves benched.

27:43.100 --> 27:44.800
Well, that was a bang-up job, Walker.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.600
All right, I'm going to give you
one last chance to come clean.

27:48.635 --> 27:51.200
Did you or did you not compromise
yourself and the Intersect?

27:59.000 --> 28:02.500
Do you ever just want
to have a normal life?

28:05.200 --> 28:06.200
Have a family?

28:07.300 --> 28:08.300
Children?

28:10.900 --> 28:12.300
The choice we made

28:12.400 --> 28:14.500
to protect something
bigger than ourselves

28:15.600 --> 28:16.800
is the right choice,

28:18.000 --> 28:20.500
hard as that is for you
to remember sometimes.

28:26.800 --> 28:27.900
I'll talk to Chuck.

28:28.700 --> 28:29.565
And if I can't fix this,

28:29.600 --> 28:31.400
then I'm going to ask
for a reassignment.

28:52.500 --> 28:53.200
Oh.

28:55.100 --> 28:57.200
Aha, Gilligan.

28:58.500 --> 28:59.600
Hey there, little buddy.

29:27.700 --> 29:29.300
The plates are on Rashan's boat.

29:30.500 --> 29:31.200
Oh...

29:32.900 --> 29:34.065
This baby's got it all.

29:34.100 --> 29:35.400
You got the four main burners...

29:35.435 --> 29:37.000
Hey, hey, we need to talk.

29:37.200 --> 29:39.100
Later. I'm about to move a Beastmaster.

29:39.135 --> 29:40.200
No. Now.

29:42.200 --> 29:42.800
Fine.

29:43.400 --> 29:44.200
I'll be right back.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.100
This better be good.

29:46.135 --> 29:46.965
Morgan sent me a jpeg

29:47.000 --> 29:48.550
from the Taiwanese attaché's yacht.

29:48.585 --> 29:50.092
Okay? I uploaded it to my computer,

29:50.127 --> 29:51.863
and then I used an XTEL software device

29:51.898 --> 29:53.600
to break down the data
into readable bytes.

29:54.200 --> 29:55.300
English, Bartowski.

29:55.800 --> 29:56.800
I blew up the photo.

29:57.600 --> 29:59.400
The counterfeiting plates
are on Rashan's boat

29:59.435 --> 30:00.865
<i>with Anna and Morgan.</i>

30:00.900 --> 30:02.800
These are the same crates
you flashed on yesterday.

30:02.835 --> 30:03.917
The one's that got us benched.

30:03.952 --> 30:05.000
Did you just hear what I said?

30:05.035 --> 30:06.300
Morgan and Anna are on...

30:09.700 --> 30:10.565
Look, I'm right about this.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.200
The Intersect is right about this.

30:13.000 --> 30:13.900
Orders are orders.

30:18.200 --> 30:19.200
Your wiener, sir.

30:19.500 --> 30:20.800
Excuse me. Look, I need to talk to you.

30:20.835 --> 30:21.765
Chuck, please, not now.

30:21.800 --> 30:24.300
Sarah, these are the same crates
that I flashed on yesterday,

30:24.335 --> 30:25.265
right here on a boat

30:25.300 --> 30:26.465
with the Taiwanese attaché.

30:26.500 --> 30:28.100
The one you saw arguing with Kirk.

30:28.135 --> 30:29.665
He's getting away with the plates.

30:29.700 --> 30:31.850
You think Kirk put the
plates on Rashan's boat?

30:31.885 --> 30:34.000
Yes. Look, I know that
your orders are to stay away

30:34.035 --> 30:35.265
from this, but you have to believe me.

30:35.300 --> 30:37.900
The plates are on that boat,
possibly with Morgan and Anna.

30:38.500 --> 30:39.900
Look, trust me, I wouldn't
even be here right now

30:39.935 --> 30:40.817
if I wasn't 100% sure.

30:40.852 --> 30:41.700
What... What are you...?

30:41.735 --> 30:42.600
Let's go.

30:51.000 --> 30:51.800
Chuck!

30:51.900 --> 30:52.500
Sarah!

30:53.000 --> 30:54.400
casey, what are you doing here?

30:54.600 --> 30:56.300
Someone needs to protect
the Intersect, huh?

30:56.700 --> 30:57.650
Well, that's very thoughtful.

30:57.685 --> 30:58.565
Thank you very much, I guess.

30:58.600 --> 31:00.600
Plus, I didn't want to
miss any gunplay. Come on.

31:06.800 --> 31:07.800
Look, there he is.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.100
There's a GPS missile
tracking device on the ship.

31:22.400 --> 31:23.300
They're going to blow it up.

31:23.335 --> 31:23.965
Kirk's got his money,

31:24.000 --> 31:25.300
and he's going to bury the evidence.

31:25.700 --> 31:27.300
I'm king of the world!

31:28.800 --> 31:30.200
I'm king of the world!

31:33.300 --> 31:34.965
i'm king of the world!

31:35.000 --> 31:36.800
They're loading
something on Kirk's boat.

31:37.200 --> 31:38.950
That's it. That's the missile launcher.

31:38.985 --> 31:40.692
They're going to follow
them out and use it

31:40.727 --> 31:42.400
to take out the
Taiwanese attaché's boat.

31:42.500 --> 31:44.500
- The one with Morgan on it? Little buddy.
- Yeah.

31:44.535 --> 31:45.665
Casey, I'm going to create a diversion.

31:45.700 --> 31:47.600
- I'll get the guards. Chuck...
- Yeah, I know. Stay in the car.

31:47.635 --> 31:48.900
- I get it.
- Not this time.

31:50.300 --> 31:52.400
We've got a GPS tracker on their ship.

31:52.435 --> 31:53.900
The rocket guides itself.

31:54.400 --> 31:55.065
Are the coordinates set?

31:55.100 --> 31:57.300
Yes, sir. I've just
got to pull the trigger.

31:57.400 --> 32:00.000
No. When the time comes,
I'll pull the trigger.

32:00.100 --> 32:01.300
I never liked Rashan anyway.

32:01.335 --> 32:01.865
Sir?

32:01.900 --> 32:03.000
We've got a situation.

32:03.035 --> 32:03.900
Lon?

32:04.700 --> 32:05.400
Lon!

32:06.000 --> 32:06.700
Oh...

32:07.500 --> 32:08.400
Hi.

32:08.700 --> 32:09.765
It's okay, it's okay.

32:09.800 --> 32:13.200
Uh, Lon, uh, I'm so sorry,
but I... I had to talk to you.

32:13.300 --> 32:14.865
Well, uh, that's great, Sarah,

32:14.900 --> 32:16.200
but we're actually about to push off.

32:16.235 --> 32:17.265
I know, I know.

32:17.300 --> 32:20.700
Uh, God, this is...
this is embarrassing,

32:20.735 --> 32:24.065
but, uh, it's just,
since I was here last,

32:24.100 --> 32:26.500
I haven't been able to
stop thinking about you,

32:26.535 --> 32:28.900
and I was just wondering
if maybe we could talk

32:28.935 --> 32:29.900
or...?

32:30.400 --> 32:33.365
Um, uh...

32:33.400 --> 32:36.000
...uh, yeah, okay, we
have a couple minutes.

32:36.500 --> 32:37.900
Well, well, well!

32:38.200 --> 32:40.050
I see how it is, Sarah!

32:40.085 --> 32:41.900
How could you do this?

32:42.200 --> 32:45.200
After everything that I've done for you.

32:45.235 --> 32:47.165
After all that I've given to you.

32:47.200 --> 32:50.100
The house... the house in the Hamptons.

32:50.300 --> 32:51.900
Huh? Or-or, uh...

32:52.100 --> 32:53.165
Or what about the summers

32:53.200 --> 32:56.500
in South Africa, or
the winters in Gstaad?

32:56.535 --> 32:58.100
You don't own me, Charles.

32:58.400 --> 32:59.900
Lon knows how I really feel.

32:59.935 --> 33:00.700
Do you love him?

33:02.700 --> 33:05.100
You know what? I actually
don't have time for this.

33:05.300 --> 33:06.700
Oh, yes, you do.

33:07.500 --> 33:08.600
Shh, shh...

33:08.900 --> 33:10.700
Yeah, I know what you're up to, buddy.

33:10.800 --> 33:12.365
- I know the truth.
- Why don't you just go home?

33:12.400 --> 33:15.500
- Tell me...
- You know what? It is time for you to go.

33:15.700 --> 33:16.400
What was that?

33:21.800 --> 33:23.665
He's in... Sarah... Oh, hey.

33:23.700 --> 33:26.100
No, he's... he went in
the... he went in the...

33:28.400 --> 33:29.400
Get out of the way.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.200
Put the rocket launcher down.

33:32.300 --> 33:34.100
Oh!

33:45.200 --> 33:46.700
Hey, hey, hey.

33:46.900 --> 33:49.600
look, look, look, The rocket
is guided by GPS software.

33:49.635 --> 33:51.000
All software can be reset.

33:52.700 --> 33:53.400
Hurry up.

33:55.800 --> 33:57.100
Great. Bye.

34:03.100 --> 34:03.765
Look at the size...

34:03.800 --> 34:05.465
these things are the size of baby cats.

34:05.500 --> 34:07.265
You're going to be sick if
you don't stop eating those.

34:07.300 --> 34:10.100
Yeah, but look, Mr. Wu, have
you ever seen something so huge?

34:10.135 --> 34:11.199
Please stop that.

34:11.500 --> 34:12.900
This is fant...

34:13.500 --> 34:14.699
Oh, Anna, look, look, look, look, look.

34:14.735 --> 34:16.199
Fireworks.

34:20.900 --> 34:21.800
That's it.

34:23.199 --> 34:24.199
Ooh...

34:25.699 --> 34:26.900
You did it, Chuck.

34:27.699 --> 34:28.764
I can't... I can't...

34:28.800 --> 34:30.100
I can't believe that worked.

34:31.300 --> 34:32.800
Chuck, where's the rocket heading now?

34:32.835 --> 34:34.864
I don't know. I reset it.

34:34.900 --> 34:37.000
You sure reset doesn't
mean return to sender?

34:39.500 --> 34:40.065
Oh, man.

34:40.100 --> 34:41.264
Oh, oh, oh, man. Oh, man.

34:41.300 --> 34:42.665
Enter another target. Away from us.

34:42.699 --> 34:45.900
I need-I need another target
first, with GPS coordinates.

34:49.100 --> 34:50.300
Casey, what about your car?

34:52.400 --> 34:53.764
- No!
- Come on, we're running out of time here!

34:53.800 --> 34:56.000
Just tell me what the GPS
coordinates are for the Crown Vic.

34:56.034 --> 34:58.000
- Tell him, Casey!
- Tell me, Casey!

34:58.500 --> 34:59.900
7-1-4-7-7.

35:04.200 --> 35:06.000
I'm really sorry, buddy. Oh!

35:09.700 --> 35:11.300
I hate this assignment.

35:21.200 --> 35:22.300
I said I was sorry, right?

35:37.300 --> 35:38.700
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, dude.

35:40.500 --> 35:42.700
How did it go with Anna's
family on the yacht?

35:43.100 --> 35:45.200
Fine, until I got seasick and barfed.

35:46.100 --> 35:47.100
Was Anna freaked out?

35:47.500 --> 35:50.600
She rubbed my back mid-puke
and then brought me a warm cloth

35:50.800 --> 35:53.200
to clean the shrimp
blobs out of my beard.

35:53.235 --> 35:55.600
- Hmm.
- She's an amazing woman, dude.

35:55.900 --> 35:57.600
And I am a lucky guy.

35:58.500 --> 36:00.600
Is there any way you can say
that to her, instead of me?

36:00.635 --> 36:02.165
Yeah, I guess I could,

36:02.200 --> 36:04.365
but that would leave me
completely vulnerable.

36:04.400 --> 36:06.650
You know, kind of like a sweet
little puppy laying on his back

36:06.685 --> 36:08.900
waiting for his belly to be
scratched, privates just kind of

36:08.935 --> 36:10.400
dangling out there for everyone to see.

36:12.300 --> 36:14.900
But I can certainly give it a shot.

36:15.300 --> 36:15.800
You know?

36:19.000 --> 36:20.300
Store's closed.

36:20.600 --> 36:21.700
Time to get polluted.

36:24.200 --> 36:25.000
Okay, people.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.000
The official Buy More Christmas...

36:27.035 --> 36:28.000
Hey, now.

36:29.600 --> 36:32.400
Holiday Party is about to commence.

36:32.500 --> 36:35.165
As a reminder, I will accept all gifts-

36:35.200 --> 36:38.400
cash and checks
- in my office or under the tree.

36:38.900 --> 36:42.300
Keep it clean and be
prepared to get down!

37:12.700 --> 37:14.400
I'll be right back.

37:16.200 --> 37:16.965
Hey, uh, listen,

37:17.000 --> 37:18.800
I
- I'm really sorry about the whole...

37:18.835 --> 37:19.765
Killing my car thing?

37:19.800 --> 37:21.700
Yeah, that. Again, sorry.

37:22.300 --> 37:23.700
She was my dream car.

37:25.100 --> 37:26.800
A Crown Victoria was your dream car?

37:27.400 --> 37:28.265
And why wouldn't it be?

37:28.300 --> 37:31.000
Really beautiful lines, I
- I've always found.

37:31.100 --> 37:32.800
I feel terrible about that, okay?

37:32.835 --> 37:34.467
But it is the holidays, right?

37:34.502 --> 37:36.100
Which is a time for forgiveness.

37:37.400 --> 37:38.700
Is there anything I can
do to make it up to you?

37:38.735 --> 37:41.400
Sure. You can buy me a new car.

37:41.700 --> 37:42.300
Ha.

37:44.900 --> 37:46.000
You're totally serious.

37:46.300 --> 37:47.300
I... that's my jam.

37:50.800 --> 37:51.400
Nun.

37:52.100 --> 37:53.300
I do believe that makes me the winner.

37:53.400 --> 37:55.000
I thought Shin beat Nun.

37:55.500 --> 37:56.300
Mm-hmm...

37:56.800 --> 37:58.500
And have you been bar
mitzvah'd, Jeffrey?

37:59.100 --> 38:01.900
- No.

38:02.400 --> 38:03.500
Anna, can I talk to you?

38:07.500 --> 38:08.200
Um...

38:09.500 --> 38:10.100
Uh...

38:10.600 --> 38:12.400
I'm really sorry that
I was kind of a jerk

38:12.435 --> 38:13.465
in front of your parents.

38:13.500 --> 38:15.000
You know, I pretended
to be something I'm not

38:15.300 --> 38:17.100
because I thought...

38:18.500 --> 38:20.000
I thought that you
were embarrassed of me.

38:20.400 --> 38:21.200
Morgan,

38:21.700 --> 38:24.065
I didn't want you to meet my parents

38:24.100 --> 38:28.000
<i>because I'm embarrassed of
who I am in front of them.</i>

38:29.400 --> 38:30.100
What do you mean?

38:30.800 --> 38:32.950
Pretending to be their
obedient little girl,

38:32.985 --> 38:35.100
dressing a certain
way, not being myself.

38:36.300 --> 38:38.000
I didn't want you to see me like that.

38:38.500 --> 38:39.900
I did miss your pretty makeup,

38:40.800 --> 38:43.600
and your inappropriately short skirts.

38:44.200 --> 38:47.000
Not everything's changed, Morgan.

38:48.200 --> 38:49.900
You think the break room door is locked?

38:49.935 --> 38:51.000
Let's find out.

38:51.300 --> 38:53.800
Merry Christmas to all
and to all a good night.

39:04.300 --> 39:05.000
Hi.

39:07.500 --> 39:10.300
I'm glad you... I'm glad you came.

39:12.800 --> 39:13.600
I got you something.

39:19.200 --> 39:22.500
It's a new alarm clock. Merry Christmas.

39:22.700 --> 39:23.600
You shouldn't have.

39:23.635 --> 39:25.100
Ah, come on.

39:25.800 --> 39:27.200
They're on sale in Home Electronics.

39:27.600 --> 39:29.300
Which reminds me, I should
probably scan that thing

39:29.335 --> 39:30.600
before you leave the store with it.

39:33.200 --> 39:35.200
Look, it's also kind of
a... kind of a thank you

39:36.100 --> 39:39.000
for believing me when you
had good reason not to.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.100
Well, it's my job, you know.

39:41.135 --> 39:41.900
It's what I do.

39:42.800 --> 39:44.800
It's the one thing I'm good at.

39:45.800 --> 39:46.500
Really?

39:47.600 --> 39:49.600
'Cause I'm pretty sure you're
good at a lot of things.

39:50.200 --> 39:52.600
Well, as you can see from everything

39:52.635 --> 39:54.100
that happened with Bryce,

39:54.800 --> 39:57.600
I'm not so good at relationships.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.500
I guess that makes two of us.

40:04.600 --> 40:07.200
And then that makes me good at...

40:08.100 --> 40:10.865
pretty much nothing, I suppose.

40:10.900 --> 40:12.700
Chuck, you're good at your job, too.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.600
And not just here, fixing computers.

40:16.300 --> 40:19.950
You know, the one where you
risk your life to save others;

40:19.985 --> 40:23.600
the one that you didn't ask
for but were supposed to have.

40:30.600 --> 40:31.300
Friends?

40:34.300 --> 40:35.300
Yeah. Friends.

40:42.200 --> 40:43.300
Mistletoe.

40:45.200 --> 40:46.900
You'll thank me later, dude.

40:48.100 --> 40:49.500
How about we just dance?

40:50.300 --> 40:50.900
Sure.

40:51.300 --> 40:52.000
Lame.

40:57.600 --> 40:58.300
Casey.

40:58.335 --> 40:59.000
Major.

40:59.400 --> 41:03.700
i am calling to imform you that the baby
version of intersect computer was successful.

41:03.735 --> 41:06.900
this means the new intersect
should be up running soon.

41:07.100 --> 41:08.900
Once the new computer is on line,

41:09.200 --> 41:11.500
it will be time to
take care of Bartowski.

41:13.700 --> 41:14.500
Roger that.

41:14.800 --> 41:18.000
I hope you have not grown
too fond of the subject.

41:18.400 --> 41:20.700
I would hate for you to be compromised.

41:24.300 --> 41:25.900
I understand my orders, General.

41:29.300 --> 41:30.900
Oh, and... John?

41:31.800 --> 41:32.600
Yeah?

41:34.100 --> 41:35.400
Happy Holidays.
