00:49.215 --> 00:51.239
Ah!

01:51.609 --> 01:54.716
I'm Detective William
Murdoch, Toronto Constabulary.

01:54.742 --> 01:58.449
- Joshua Jones.
- You said your son saw the incident?

01:58.491 --> 02:00.028
He said he saw something.

02:00.238 --> 02:02.068
I'm not sure if it's real or not.

02:02.306 --> 02:04.165
He's not right in the head.

02:05.402 --> 02:07.159
What's your name, son?

02:07.192 --> 02:10.258
He doesn't talk much.
Except for nonsense.

02:10.862 --> 02:12.764
Tell me what you saw.

02:13.906 --> 02:16.100
I saw the angel of death.

02:16.540 --> 02:18.196
On horseback.

02:18.937 --> 02:20.956
He ran the man through.

02:21.243 --> 02:24.554
- With a lance.
- Now, Ezekiel...

02:26.245 --> 02:28.774
You saw an angel on horseback?

02:28.899 --> 02:30.682
He had wings.

02:31.031 --> 02:33.352
That's why I knew he was an angel.

02:33.665 --> 02:35.160
What did I tell you?

02:35.481 --> 02:38.311
- It's nothing but nonsense.
- It's the truth.

02:59.469 --> 03:00.980
Higgins, make a move.

03:03.131 --> 03:04.817
- There ya go.
- What are you doing?

03:04.849 --> 03:06.854
- Making a move.
- The knight doesn't move like that.

03:06.870 --> 03:08.330
I've told you a million times.

03:08.358 --> 03:12.190
Two spaces and one left or right,
or one space and two left or right.

03:12.223 --> 03:14.593
Honestly, does this go in one
ear and come out the other?

03:14.668 --> 03:15.797
Fine.

03:16.736 --> 03:19.084
- But that's stupid.
- Well, that's the rules.

03:19.123 --> 03:20.593
Morning, gentlemen.

03:20.643 --> 03:23.946
- Ah, the art of war.
- You play, sir?

03:24.071 --> 03:26.366
I did, but I was never very good.

03:26.919 --> 03:29.308
Really, sir? A man of your intelligence?

03:29.341 --> 03:32.224
Plenty bright enough, Crabtree,
just too bloody impatient.

03:32.721 --> 03:34.772
Now get to work, the pair of you.

03:36.191 --> 03:38.417
Does that mean we can
stop playing, then?

03:39.065 --> 03:40.356
Sure.

03:41.753 --> 03:43.105
Checkmate.

03:44.095 --> 03:46.692
Well, the boy may have
spoken nonsense in the past,

03:46.724 --> 03:48.176
but this is the truth.

03:48.539 --> 03:50.695
The victim was run through with a lance.

03:51.256 --> 03:54.385
I would think this to be
a first, even for you two.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.337
I think you might be right.

03:58.527 --> 04:00.294
Perhaps this may help.

04:00.785 --> 04:03.851
- These were in his jacket pocket.
- What are they?

04:03.976 --> 04:06.128
I don't know. I haven't
looked through them.

04:09.404 --> 04:12.517
- Looks to be Russian.
- So a Russian man

04:12.568 --> 04:15.963
was killed by a winged angel
of death in a field in Markham?

04:16.088 --> 04:17.697
So it would seem.

04:18.945 --> 04:20.879
And there was one more thing.

04:20.906 --> 04:23.262
This was found in the
folds of his clothes.

04:24.305 --> 04:25.681
Thank you.

04:32.724 --> 04:35.625
You've certainly been
drinking a lot of that.

04:36.285 --> 04:38.330
It just eases my stomach.

04:50.555 --> 04:52.499
Just move one of those little fellows.

04:52.571 --> 04:55.153
Yeah, perfect. Thank you, Higgins.

04:55.880 --> 04:57.540
- Detective Watts.
- Yes.

04:57.541 --> 04:59.737
Given your facility with language,

04:59.766 --> 05:02.454
- I was hoping you might assist me with this.
- Of course.

05:02.579 --> 05:04.517
That must be some sort of code.

05:04.536 --> 05:06.194
- Well, it's Russian.
- Russian?

05:06.228 --> 05:08.536
You can tell by the Cyrillic alphabet.

05:08.770 --> 05:09.944
Of course you can.

05:09.950 --> 05:12.012
They appear to be travel documents.

05:12.029 --> 05:14.729
A Russian man, aged 37.

05:14.745 --> 05:17.312
His name is Dimitri Gorkhov.

05:17.379 --> 05:19.799
- Say again?
- Dimitri Gorkhov.

05:20.503 --> 05:22.124
You know who this man is, George?

05:22.180 --> 05:25.064
Do I, sir? He's the 10th best
chess player in the world.

05:25.070 --> 05:26.719
At least according to current rankings.

05:26.736 --> 05:28.469
What would he be doing in Toronto?

05:28.536 --> 05:30.709
Well, he must be here for
the tournament, of course.

05:30.834 --> 05:33.425
Sir, the very best in the
world are all assembling

05:33.442 --> 05:35.594
for a grand exhibition
right here in the city.

05:35.644 --> 05:37.656
It won't affect world rankings, but

05:37.668 --> 05:39.111
it's expected to be a harbinger

05:39.112 --> 05:42.317
- of what's to come at the world championships later in...
- Thank you, George.

05:42.385 --> 05:45.212
- We should go...
- Not so fast, Crabtree.

05:45.492 --> 05:48.823
An event of this magnitude should
be attended by a ranking officer.

05:48.948 --> 05:51.411
- Sir?
- Well, all these foreigners.

05:51.536 --> 05:53.651
There may be a need
for British diplomacy.

05:54.217 --> 05:56.123
Grab your coat and hat, Murdoch.

05:56.766 --> 06:00.208
- Thank you.
- All right, Constable, back to the game.

06:05.021 --> 06:06.436
Russians.

06:09.029 --> 06:11.836
Excuse me, sir, Toronto Constabulary.

06:11.870 --> 06:13.344
What can I do for you?

06:13.730 --> 06:16.362
Do you know a man named Dimitri Gorkhov?

06:17.195 --> 06:19.738
Yes. Where is he?

06:19.863 --> 06:21.409
Drunk again, I'll bet.

06:21.745 --> 06:24.204
- I apologize.
- He's dead.

06:24.260 --> 06:26.088
He was found murdered yesterday.

06:26.831 --> 06:28.424
Oh.

06:28.798 --> 06:30.302
I see.

06:31.389 --> 06:34.459
- This is not good news.
- No.

06:34.718 --> 06:37.262
Do you know who might
want to do this to him?

06:37.955 --> 06:39.811
Someone who is...

06:39.856 --> 06:41.699
desperate to win the tournament.

06:42.433 --> 06:44.021
How was he killed?

06:44.146 --> 06:48.451
A witness reports he was
killed by a knight on horseback.

06:50.759 --> 06:52.548
Do you know what this is?

06:55.371 --> 06:56.714
I have no idea.

06:56.747 --> 06:59.158
You'd be well advised
to tell us the truth.

06:59.379 --> 07:01.688
I said I have no idea.

07:02.012 --> 07:03.979
I'll tell you when we're finished.

07:04.104 --> 07:06.316
- Unhand me.
- Sir.

07:10.795 --> 07:13.186
No need to cause an
international incident.

07:13.247 --> 07:14.689
That bugger knows something.

07:15.433 --> 07:17.283
I would tend to agree.

07:17.842 --> 07:20.586
But I'll wager someone
else here does as well.

07:21.570 --> 07:23.895
British diplomacy, sir.

07:24.163 --> 07:27.521
- Excuse me, Toronto Constabulary.
- Yes?

07:27.852 --> 07:30.065
Would you happen to know what this is?

07:32.251 --> 07:34.644
I have never seen it before.

07:45.539 --> 07:48.367
Oh, I see. You're cheating on me.

07:48.399 --> 07:50.011
Very disappointed, George.

07:50.027 --> 07:52.504
- Miss Bloom. You play?
- My father taught me.

07:52.537 --> 07:55.505
Miss Bloom is by far the finest
player I've ever encountered.

07:55.528 --> 07:57.668
Chess is one of our pastimes.

07:57.685 --> 08:00.133
I didn't think he cared
to share it with others.

08:12.784 --> 08:15.327
Let's see you wiggle
out of that, George.

08:15.937 --> 08:18.391
Not one person said a bloody word.

08:18.516 --> 08:19.995
One of them is involved.

08:20.031 --> 08:23.601
You think one of those chess players
is also a knight in shining armour?

08:23.634 --> 08:25.704
That's nothing but a
young boy's imagination.

08:25.737 --> 08:27.002
I'm not so sure about that, sir.

08:27.026 --> 08:29.161
Regardless, I'd wager that
someone at that tournament

08:29.184 --> 08:32.408
- knows something about this.
- We need a man on the inside.

08:37.875 --> 08:39.111
No.

08:39.160 --> 08:40.770
- No?
- No.

08:40.809 --> 08:43.725
Sir, I wouldn't stand a
chance. These are masters.

08:43.727 --> 08:47.311
- I'm a hobbyist at best.
- What about Miss Bloom?

08:47.436 --> 08:50.206
- It's not exactly that sort of mission, Watts.
- Sir.

08:50.331 --> 08:52.772
Miss Bloom is a very good player.

08:52.946 --> 08:55.900
She is. But the tournament
doesn't allow women.

08:56.025 --> 08:57.648
Which is a shame. I honestly think

08:57.664 --> 08:59.584
she would give any of
them a run for their money.

09:01.510 --> 09:03.576
Perhaps she can play them.

09:03.701 --> 09:05.266
Sir?

09:05.462 --> 09:08.346
She's a woman. She can't.

09:08.385 --> 09:10.112
She may be able to.

09:11.163 --> 09:13.550
With some slight modifications...

09:14.360 --> 09:15.797
Yes.

09:18.190 --> 09:20.625
Right then. We'll leave you to it.

09:28.344 --> 09:30.424
Would you care to walk with me?

09:30.994 --> 09:32.738
What about the Detective?

09:33.352 --> 09:35.186
He's working late.

09:36.203 --> 09:38.907
If you don't mind, there are a few
things I would like to finish up first.

09:38.931 --> 09:40.122
Of course not.

09:40.335 --> 09:42.631
I have to say, you've
been doing an excellent job

09:42.643 --> 09:44.129
since you started here.

09:44.149 --> 09:45.448
Thank you.

09:45.946 --> 09:47.315
Night.

10:03.110 --> 10:04.519
_

10:04.558 --> 10:06.436
_

10:57.327 --> 10:58.847
Four stitches, William.

10:59.686 --> 11:03.185
It always surprises me how you
find newer and newer ways to die.

11:03.235 --> 11:06.465
Well, at least I haven't found
one that's successful yet.

11:06.779 --> 11:09.893
We have a child coming, William.
You need to be more careful.

11:10.245 --> 11:13.191
I was simply trying to walk home.

11:14.438 --> 11:17.529
Imagine my surprise when the
report of a bleeding vagrant

11:17.557 --> 11:19.212
in an alleyway turned out to be you.

11:19.337 --> 11:20.419
What happened?

11:20.475 --> 11:23.381
I was attacked by a knight in armour.

11:23.414 --> 11:25.384
- With wings?
- With wings.

11:25.645 --> 11:29.250
- You're bloody lucky.
- I don't think luck had much to do with it, sir.

11:29.283 --> 11:30.636
If he intended to kill me,

11:30.658 --> 11:32.558
he certainly could
have accomplished that.

11:32.922 --> 11:34.560
He was after that crest.

11:34.685 --> 11:37.365
Which narrows down
the field quite a bit.

11:38.260 --> 11:41.150
The only people who knew I
was in possession of that pin

11:41.183 --> 11:43.035
were attendees at the tournament.

11:43.067 --> 11:45.544
All the more reason to get
Crabtree into that game.

11:46.325 --> 11:48.053
That's my intention.

11:48.718 --> 11:51.575
- Careful. It's very delicate.
- Right.

11:52.078 --> 11:54.756
- Now, Miss Bloom has agreed to this?
- Yes, sir.

11:54.795 --> 11:56.749
She's quite excited about it, in fact.

11:56.791 --> 11:59.446
Especially now, what with
Mr. Gorkhov being slain,

11:59.451 --> 12:01.420
and Master Troubetskoy
taking the reigns.

12:01.452 --> 12:02.844
Troubetskoy?

12:03.101 --> 12:05.913
Yes, sir. He was a Master
before his retirement.

12:06.377 --> 12:07.870
The Russians brought him this time

12:07.903 --> 12:10.161
simply to be an advisor to Mr. Gorkhov,

12:10.195 --> 12:12.130
but since his untimely death,

12:12.409 --> 12:15.265
Master Troubetskoy is
returning to the fray.

12:15.327 --> 12:16.993
It's an honour to play
against him, really.

12:17.015 --> 12:19.111
Miss Bloom has studied
his game for years.

12:20.067 --> 12:22.673
There's more to your Miss
Bloom than meets the eye.

12:22.706 --> 12:24.198
There is indeed, sir.

12:24.443 --> 12:26.844
As if what meets the eye
wasn't enough already.

12:27.584 --> 12:28.797
Indeed.

12:29.010 --> 12:31.111
Right. We need to test the range.

12:31.128 --> 12:32.614
Go stand at the front
of the Station House

12:32.623 --> 12:34.578
- and I'll send transmissions.
- Sir.

12:37.855 --> 12:39.523
Murdoch said this would work?

12:39.648 --> 12:41.052
He's confident it will, sir.

12:41.986 --> 12:44.129
I have to say I am getting
quite excited about this.

12:44.254 --> 12:46.072
Sir, I'll be going head to head

12:46.082 --> 12:48.176
against some of the best
chess players in the world.

12:48.301 --> 12:49.395
Remember, Crabtree,

12:49.409 --> 12:51.531
you're there to find out
about the murder. Nothing more.

12:51.555 --> 12:53.044
Yes. Of course.

12:54.140 --> 12:55.347
William,

12:55.874 --> 12:57.681
I have something for you.

12:58.070 --> 13:00.100
Oh. Does it pertain to the case?

13:00.153 --> 13:01.620
Not in the slightest.

13:02.009 --> 13:04.921
Just a reminder as to why
you need to be more careful.

13:08.521 --> 13:09.929
Listen.

13:14.240 --> 13:16.208
This is going to happen!

13:19.633 --> 13:20.999
I hear a heartbeat.

13:21.032 --> 13:23.560
- Is this going to take all bloody day?
- Sir, no.

13:23.835 --> 13:25.407
I can hear his voice.

13:26.346 --> 13:28.139
It's really fast.

13:28.173 --> 13:30.808
- Is that normal?
- Quite.

13:31.243 --> 13:32.778
You have to remember

13:32.811 --> 13:34.745
it's only the size of a plum.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.865
Our child.

13:37.990 --> 13:41.393
Its little heart beating inside
the womb of the woman I love.

13:42.180 --> 13:44.755
- I couldn't be happier.
- What?

13:45.028 --> 13:46.450
Sir!

13:47.247 --> 13:48.941
- Sir!
- Soon I'm not going to be able

13:48.946 --> 13:50.610
- to hide my condition.
- Sir!

13:50.664 --> 13:52.331
- What?
- So until that point,

13:52.349 --> 13:54.098
I'd like to enjoy the secrecy.

13:54.606 --> 13:56.194
So not a word.

13:57.635 --> 13:59.406
- She's pregnant!
- Who?

13:59.438 --> 14:01.266
- Dr. Ogden.
- Really?

14:01.391 --> 14:04.539
- Sir, there's a heartbeat and everything!
- Give me that.

14:04.542 --> 14:06.059
I mean, you can't hear the heartbeat,

14:06.077 --> 14:08.377
but you can hear them
talking about the heartbeat.

14:08.821 --> 14:11.375
- And he never said anything to you about this?
- Sir, no.

14:11.548 --> 14:14.741
- Well, congratulations are in order.
- No, no, sir.

14:14.759 --> 14:16.573
Dr. Ogden said she
wants to keep it quiet.

14:17.092 --> 14:19.649
- Why the bloody hell would she say that?
- I don't know.

14:19.699 --> 14:20.796
Women.

14:20.922 --> 14:23.544
You can never really tell what's
going on inside their heads, can you?

14:23.561 --> 14:26.264
Oftentimes, sir, more than you
think, sir. In my experience.

14:26.298 --> 14:27.644
In your experience?

14:28.210 --> 14:29.922
- Sir!
- Gentlemen.

14:32.240 --> 14:33.789
Faring well?

14:34.508 --> 14:35.870
I am indeed, George.

14:35.938 --> 14:38.762
- Remember, get plenty of rest.
- Yes.

14:39.574 --> 14:40.768
I shall.

14:41.791 --> 14:43.581
- Cheerio.
- Right.

14:44.119 --> 14:45.865
- Be careful.
- Mind your step.

14:54.832 --> 14:57.304
- Thank you for your assistance, Miss Bloom.
- My pleasure.

14:58.792 --> 15:02.354
Right. The draws for the preliminary
match have been announced.

15:02.397 --> 15:05.105
And as host, Canada can
enter whomever they like.

15:05.988 --> 15:07.426
Who do we play first?

15:07.830 --> 15:10.338
Marcel Monet. The French representative.

15:10.349 --> 15:12.574
Oh. Good. I've played him before.

15:12.863 --> 15:14.791
- Miss Bloom?
- By correspondence.

15:14.916 --> 15:16.648
- We can beat him.
- Right.

15:16.666 --> 15:17.883
Are the three of you ready?

15:18.627 --> 15:20.093
As ready as we'll ever be.

15:20.121 --> 15:21.602
Everything you need is in this case.

15:21.617 --> 15:23.924
I have secured a small
suite just off the hall.

15:23.949 --> 15:27.268
You won't be disturbed.

15:30.291 --> 15:31.558
Detective Murdoch.

15:32.520 --> 15:34.491
What made you think to
take this photograph?

15:34.765 --> 15:36.798
I thought it would be
wise to take inventory

15:36.801 --> 15:38.754
of all the cases I have
been assigned to work on.

15:39.062 --> 15:41.362
For my interest, and for
that of others in the future.

15:41.452 --> 15:42.865
Well, it's a good thing you did.

15:43.094 --> 15:45.891
I've also taken it upon myself
to learn about the crest.

15:46.109 --> 15:47.161
And?

15:47.379 --> 15:49.614
It was the Kingdom of
Poland's coat of arms.

15:50.913 --> 15:51.986
Oh.

15:52.287 --> 15:54.623
- Excellent work, Miss Hart.
- Thank you, sir.

15:54.923 --> 15:56.863
It's my desire to impress you.

15:56.988 --> 15:58.811
I find this work quite fascinating.

16:06.728 --> 16:07.773
Can you hear me?

16:08.392 --> 16:09.408
Can you hear me?

16:09.533 --> 16:11.021
Not too loud!

16:12.502 --> 16:13.922
Now, when Marcel makes a move,

16:13.929 --> 16:16.451
you have to say what it was
out loud, but not too loud,

16:16.469 --> 16:17.560
so I can counter.

16:17.875 --> 16:19.077
Yes, I understand.

16:20.179 --> 16:22.043
Monsieur Crabtree, is it?

16:22.068 --> 16:24.369
Yes. Mr. Monet. Pleasure to meet you.

16:24.372 --> 16:26.899
I must say I recently spent some
time in your wonderful country.

16:26.923 --> 16:28.372
Good for you.

16:28.547 --> 16:30.889
When you lose this match,
perhaps you should go back.

16:31.835 --> 16:33.395
George, don't let him rattle you.

16:34.343 --> 16:36.660
You expect a quick victory then, do you?

16:36.906 --> 16:38.185
We shall see.

16:40.729 --> 16:42.688
Ah, I should have guessed.

16:43.238 --> 16:44.995
Pawn to Queen 4.

16:48.505 --> 16:49.994
Your Knight

16:50.008 --> 16:52.203
to King's Bishop 3.

16:56.681 --> 16:58.382
It is the crest of Poland.

16:58.408 --> 17:00.403
Or rather, the former Poland

17:00.528 --> 17:04.185
before she was carved up
by the Russians and Germans.

17:05.189 --> 17:07.773
Why is an outdated national emblem

17:07.823 --> 17:09.594
the subject of a police inquiry?

17:09.626 --> 17:12.605
It was found on the
person of a murder victim.

17:12.646 --> 17:14.950
- A Pole?
- No, a Russian.

17:15.336 --> 17:16.593
Ah.

17:16.944 --> 17:18.476
That is something.

17:18.828 --> 17:20.372
How did he die?

17:20.404 --> 17:23.752
An eyewitness claims he was
run through with a lance.

17:25.442 --> 17:28.269
I imagine that is not
an everyday occurrence

17:28.278 --> 17:30.749
- in your line of work.
- It is not.

17:30.936 --> 17:34.285
The wielder of the lance
was apparently a knight.

17:34.318 --> 17:37.588
- With wings?
- Yes. How did you know?

17:40.892 --> 17:43.117
These were knights of the Polish nation.

17:43.721 --> 17:44.995
The Husaria.

17:45.325 --> 17:48.332
- The assailant was one of those?
- I doubt it.

17:48.343 --> 17:50.969
The Husaria have not ridden
in nearly two centuries.

17:51.001 --> 17:55.101
So someone was impersonating
a Husarian knight.

17:55.956 --> 17:57.918
Can you fathom any reason

17:57.942 --> 18:00.288
why someone would do
such a thing, Professor?

18:00.780 --> 18:04.215
Well, the Husaria rode to
protect Poland and her honour.

18:04.446 --> 18:07.420
Something we have had precious little of

18:07.442 --> 18:09.520
after we were taken over by Russia.

18:10.181 --> 18:11.846
So, revenge.

18:13.708 --> 18:15.083
I would say...

18:16.011 --> 18:17.462
retribution.

18:39.967 --> 18:44.130
- Perhaps I misjudged you, Mr. Crabtree.
- Really? How's that?

18:44.590 --> 18:46.591
At first I thought you inept,

18:46.636 --> 18:49.319
but you appear almost adept.

18:52.404 --> 18:55.489
Bishop to King Three... zoot alore!

18:55.517 --> 18:58.170
Do you need to speak every move I make?

18:59.899 --> 19:01.373
Helps me think.

19:04.214 --> 19:07.596
- Marcel is a creature of habit.
- Excuse me?

19:07.657 --> 19:09.914
I've played exactly the
same match with him before.

19:09.948 --> 19:11.291
By correspondence.

19:11.638 --> 19:14.467
Queen's Bishop to Queen's Knight Two.

19:14.758 --> 19:17.575
If I'm right, this will
all be over in four moves.

19:19.828 --> 19:21.169
Ezekiel.

19:21.448 --> 19:22.784
I believe you.

19:23.958 --> 19:26.221
I believe you saw what you said you did.

19:26.473 --> 19:29.100
I was attacked by the angel as well.

19:29.767 --> 19:31.325
Then you must be good.

19:31.626 --> 19:32.901
What do you mean?

19:33.605 --> 19:35.333
Because he spared you.

19:36.881 --> 19:39.043
Ezekiel, I wonder if you could help me.

19:40.811 --> 19:44.360
Do you remember anything else
about that day, anything at all?

19:46.718 --> 19:49.354
The angel took something
from the dead man.

19:49.569 --> 19:51.755
- What was it?
- I don't know.

19:52.425 --> 19:54.593
But what would a man have

19:54.625 --> 19:56.757
that an angel would need?

20:04.091 --> 20:07.105
I heard you put Marcel
Monet in his place.

20:07.349 --> 20:09.003
It was a well fought match.

20:09.059 --> 20:11.183
Why is it I have not heard of you?

20:12.406 --> 20:14.268
This is actually my first tournament.

20:14.279 --> 20:15.793
I live in Toronto.

20:15.816 --> 20:18.314
I would have thought
you would be known here.

20:18.879 --> 20:21.118
I'm a bit shy.

20:21.152 --> 20:23.519
Well, you must get over that.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.973
Come, have a drink with us.

20:34.598 --> 20:35.940
What's this?

20:36.516 --> 20:37.863
Vodka.

20:41.490 --> 20:43.106
Come, Mr. Crabtree,

20:43.150 --> 20:45.801
let us offer the
Russian dogs our regrets.

20:45.823 --> 20:47.137
Uh...

20:49.511 --> 20:51.876
I came to offer my condolences

20:51.893 --> 20:54.765
to your fellow countryman, Mr. Gorkhov.

20:56.208 --> 20:57.784
What a tragedy.

21:00.456 --> 21:02.887
It was a most unusual way to die.

21:04.497 --> 21:06.755
You played well today, Mr. Crabtree.

21:06.817 --> 21:08.600
I wish you luck tomorrow.

21:08.633 --> 21:11.574
You are aware you have
drawn Master Troubetskoy?

21:11.652 --> 21:14.948
Yes. I will do what I can.

21:14.955 --> 21:16.671
It will be simple enough task,

21:16.682 --> 21:18.851
he's nothing but old befuddled man.

21:18.879 --> 21:20.717
You watch your tongue.

21:21.623 --> 21:25.549
In fact, it is good thing
Mr. Gorkhov was killed.

21:25.674 --> 21:28.788
It spared him the humiliation of defeat.

21:32.041 --> 21:35.250
All right, gentlemen, that's
enough! There's no need for this!

21:39.437 --> 21:42.272
Your next step will be your last.

21:42.311 --> 21:45.369
Ha, ha, ha! The Szczerbiec.

21:48.437 --> 21:51.375
Does it break your heart
that she's no longer yours?

21:51.409 --> 21:53.506
Are you so sure of that?

22:11.919 --> 22:13.356
Well, uh...

22:16.396 --> 22:18.481
I'll be seeing you all
in the morning, I suppose.

22:24.709 --> 22:26.458
Are you all right, father?

22:30.248 --> 22:32.774
Aha! That's it!

22:32.849 --> 22:36.122
- Sir, that looks like the tattoo.
- It is the Szczerbiec.

22:36.201 --> 22:38.956
- If you say.
- It's the name of the sword.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.286
George, you said you're
playing the Russian Master next?

22:41.303 --> 22:43.791
That's right. And I'm not
sure I fancy our chances.

22:43.802 --> 22:46.197
You need to keep him at the
table as long as you can.

22:46.230 --> 22:49.330
We have to keep eyes on both
the Poles and the Russians.

22:49.380 --> 22:51.180
Right. Sir, one other thing.

22:51.191 --> 22:53.269
The Russians have a couple
of chaps with them who

22:53.297 --> 22:55.198
don't look like they have
much to do with chess.

22:55.220 --> 22:56.819
Mm-hmm. Thank you.

22:57.355 --> 22:59.149
What the hell are you on about, Murdoch?

22:59.188 --> 23:01.413
- The Szczerbiec.
- I know that. But what about it?

23:01.445 --> 23:03.414
It may not be in St. Petersburg.

23:03.539 --> 23:05.417
And why would anyone
give a toss about that?

23:05.450 --> 23:08.680
The Szczerbiec is a coronation
sword of the kingdom of Poland.

23:08.685 --> 23:11.196
It was taken by the
Russians as a spoil of war.

23:11.234 --> 23:14.499
- Still not a toss to be given.
- Sir, there are a number of rumours

23:14.525 --> 23:18.048
that would suggest the Poles furnished
the Russians with an imitation.

23:19.439 --> 23:22.100
- And the real sword?
- Taken to the New World.

23:22.128 --> 23:24.201
To be brought back at the right time.

23:24.838 --> 23:27.269
So I'm to believe that
the sacred sword of Poland

23:27.305 --> 23:30.220
is now residing somewhere in
the heart of Markham, Ontario?

23:30.963 --> 23:32.942
That could very well be the case.

23:40.516 --> 23:42.864
Ridiculous. Utterly ridiculous.

23:42.936 --> 23:46.432
The Russians have the sword. They
took it when they stole our nation.

23:46.447 --> 23:47.822
And the rumours?

23:48.280 --> 23:52.623
Optimistic nonsense. A vain
belief from a destroyed people

23:52.651 --> 23:55.299
that their dignity has not
been completely stripped away.

23:55.333 --> 23:57.302
You seem quite convinced.

23:58.185 --> 23:59.744
I am convinced.

23:59.936 --> 24:01.493
I am a Pole.

24:02.125 --> 24:03.812
I would like nothing
more than to believe

24:03.835 --> 24:06.668
my people still held the Szczerbiec.

24:08.111 --> 24:09.380
But we do not.

24:12.159 --> 24:13.495
So what do you think?

24:14.093 --> 24:17.284
I think the Professor
doth protest too much.

24:17.597 --> 24:19.090
Consider this, sir.

24:19.152 --> 24:22.861
A young boy sees a man dressed
as a Polish Hussar knight

24:22.894 --> 24:25.262
kill another man and
take something from him.

24:25.387 --> 24:27.265
That man is a Russian

24:27.298 --> 24:30.252
whose compatriots have
fought with Polish men,

24:30.275 --> 24:33.472
one of whom wears a Szczerbiec tattoo.

24:33.813 --> 24:36.121
So you think this Russian
found the Szczerbiec,

24:36.140 --> 24:37.942
stole it and then was
killed for his efforts?

24:37.974 --> 24:39.726
- Szczerbiec.
- Sh...

24:40.067 --> 24:41.359
You do, don't ya?

24:41.565 --> 24:43.963
Well, I suppose if I was in
your shoes, and at your age,

24:43.980 --> 24:46.151
I'd indulge in one last
flight of fancy myself.

24:47.569 --> 24:49.950
Let's see how George is getting on.

25:02.558 --> 25:04.082
Mr. Crabtree,

25:04.124 --> 25:07.519
- our patience is waning...
- Yes, I'm thinking.

25:08.043 --> 25:11.299
Your last move was a real doozy. I mean,

25:11.655 --> 25:14.212
Rook to King Four, it's...

25:14.337 --> 25:16.406
I keep going over and over it.

25:16.531 --> 25:18.156
Rook to King Four.

25:18.187 --> 25:20.842
I heard you the first
three times, George.

25:20.967 --> 25:23.994
- Miss Bloom...
- I'm thinking.

25:31.009 --> 25:32.693
King's Bishop

25:32.748 --> 25:35.837
to Kings's Knight Two.

25:39.665 --> 25:41.251
No!

25:41.559 --> 25:43.106
No, King's Bishop

25:43.140 --> 25:45.944
to Queen's Bishop Four.

25:55.353 --> 25:58.158
Had you excited there
for a moment, didn't I?

26:05.496 --> 26:07.073
Doctor Ogden.

26:07.324 --> 26:09.176
Oh, thank you, Miss Hart.

26:09.232 --> 26:13.047
- You seem in fine spirits.
- I am.

26:15.304 --> 26:17.218
Was there something else?

26:17.938 --> 26:20.600
May I ask you a question
of a personal nature?

26:20.725 --> 26:24.115
Of course, although I may not answer.

26:25.260 --> 26:27.828
You are pregnant, are you not?

26:28.986 --> 26:30.640
Well, that is straight to the point.

26:30.765 --> 26:32.524
Why would you say that?

26:32.569 --> 26:35.011
Your demeanour. Your complexion.

26:35.051 --> 26:37.404
I also noticed a slight
change in your figure.

26:37.460 --> 26:40.999
But I suppose most of
all, I sensed your glow.

26:41.372 --> 26:42.899
My glow?

26:43.429 --> 26:46.070
I saw the same in my sister
when she was with child.

26:48.130 --> 26:51.210
Well, Miss Hart, your
observations are correct.

26:51.467 --> 26:54.311
But if possible, I would like
you to keep them to yourself.

26:54.726 --> 26:56.269
You have my word.

27:21.708 --> 27:24.984
Well, that's unexpected.

27:25.029 --> 27:27.068
Pawn to Queen Five.

27:28.096 --> 27:30.293
- George?
- Crabtree?

27:30.690 --> 27:32.910
What are those two doing here?

27:34.417 --> 27:36.213
How are you going on, bugalugs?

27:36.783 --> 27:38.292
I'm trying to think.

27:38.532 --> 27:41.466
That must be quite difficult
considering the distraction.

27:41.488 --> 27:44.961
The simple minded always have
a hard time concentrating.

27:44.994 --> 27:47.632
Ha, ha, ha! Did you hear that, Crabtree?

27:47.757 --> 27:49.739
Did you think I was talking about him?

27:50.438 --> 27:51.735
Oh.

27:55.245 --> 27:56.984
Come on.

28:01.506 --> 28:04.222
- That's curious.
- What's that?

28:04.301 --> 28:06.542
Those two Polish men are leaving.

28:06.855 --> 28:10.221
Why would they leave their
compatriot in the middle of a match?

28:10.432 --> 28:13.053
Obviously they couldn't
handle all the excitement.

28:13.909 --> 28:16.267
- Keep an eye on them.
- Oh, yes.

28:19.007 --> 28:22.014
George, the Russian men you mentioned

28:22.031 --> 28:23.769
with this delegation?

28:24.987 --> 28:26.541
There were.

28:27.049 --> 28:28.933
Where are they?

28:30.286 --> 28:32.509
I'm sorry, my mind was on the match.

28:32.542 --> 28:34.711
Bloody hell, Crabtree. You had one job.

28:34.744 --> 28:37.358
Well, two, actually...

28:53.430 --> 28:56.893
You're only prolonging the
inevitable, Mr. Crabtree.

28:56.960 --> 28:58.972
If you don't mind, Miss,

28:59.002 --> 29:01.761
church isn't over if the
organ's still playing.

29:02.560 --> 29:05.412
- Have you not heard that one?
- No.

29:06.632 --> 29:08.012
Gentlemen.

29:09.471 --> 29:12.299
- Where are they?
- They didn't come back here?

29:12.618 --> 29:15.736
- Do they look like they're back?
- I suppose not.

29:15.861 --> 29:17.487
Did you find anything of use?

29:17.520 --> 29:20.191
- I know they booked passage back home.
- To Poland?

29:20.370 --> 29:22.806
Well, to what once was. Which is curious

29:22.826 --> 29:24.828
considering there is
a revolution going on.

29:25.103 --> 29:27.026
- When are they set to leave?
- Tomorrow.

29:27.065 --> 29:28.546
Anything else?

29:28.809 --> 29:30.632
This is the thing about travel agents.

29:30.699 --> 29:33.376
They not only know where
you are going, but also

29:33.426 --> 29:35.148
where you are coming from.

29:35.176 --> 29:37.601
Excellent. Thank you, Watts.

29:45.215 --> 29:46.516
It doesn't make any sense.

29:46.544 --> 29:48.421
The revolution has got
nothing to do with Poland.

29:48.445 --> 29:50.330
- It's the bloody Bolsheviks.
- Indeed, sir,

29:50.346 --> 29:52.280
but if you are a Polish nationalist,

29:52.323 --> 29:54.991
you can use the chaos to your advantage.

29:55.025 --> 29:57.025
Bring the sword home. Rally the people.

29:57.042 --> 29:58.596
Break apart from Russia.

30:05.694 --> 30:08.349
Well, I guess we know what
George's Russian friends were up to.

30:08.372 --> 30:11.580
Hm. I'd also wager that
if the sword was here,

30:11.608 --> 30:14.311
- then it's long gone.
- I tend to agree.

30:17.513 --> 30:18.723
Sir.

30:21.121 --> 30:22.886
Professor Stanislav.

30:23.127 --> 30:26.391
It seems that the Professor
was less than honest with us.

30:30.394 --> 30:31.623
Ahem.

30:48.432 --> 30:50.617
I think Mr. Crabtree is attempting

30:50.662 --> 30:53.508
to break the Yugoslavian's
record for delay.

30:53.759 --> 30:57.219
Why not? It's the only record
he has a chance to achieve.

30:57.344 --> 31:00.357
All right... I'm almost ready.

31:06.307 --> 31:09.667
Yes, I realize I must make a move.

31:11.117 --> 31:13.737
George,  take your Queen's
Rook and move it to...

31:14.824 --> 31:16.106
George?

31:16.140 --> 31:19.218
And what? What? What? What?

31:20.709 --> 31:24.079
Excuse me. A nervous tick. What, what?

31:25.845 --> 31:27.852
Looks like the professor scarpered.

31:27.884 --> 31:29.472
I don't think so.

31:38.376 --> 31:40.829
Sir, look at this.

31:43.781 --> 31:46.665
It would seem the sword has
more than a symbolic use.

31:46.903 --> 31:49.561
Professor by day, Husaria by night.

32:01.518 --> 32:02.955
Are you, uh,

32:03.150 --> 32:06.231
waiting for my father's
expiration to claim victory?

32:06.235 --> 32:07.660
No, it's just

32:07.693 --> 32:10.980
his last move has left
me with a bit of a puzzle.

32:12.551 --> 32:14.787
Oh my word!

32:14.832 --> 32:18.208
Are you the Mr. George Crabtree

32:18.234 --> 32:20.449
I've heard so much about?

32:21.287 --> 32:23.473
Yes. Yes, I am.

32:23.598 --> 32:25.702
Would you mind terribly

32:26.429 --> 32:28.412
if I gave you a great,

32:28.614 --> 32:29.956
big...

32:30.006 --> 32:32.208
We are in the middle of a game.

32:32.510 --> 32:35.472
- Mr. Crabtree...
- Queen's Rook to Queen's One.

32:35.511 --> 32:37.484
Yes, of course.

32:37.708 --> 32:39.133
Forgive me.

32:39.698 --> 32:41.872
I seem to have garnered some admirers.

32:42.207 --> 32:43.672
All right.

32:48.837 --> 32:51.659
The Poles had hidden the
sword here, in Canada.

32:52.101 --> 32:54.068
And that first Russian tried to steal it

32:54.069 --> 32:55.370
and was killed for his efforts.

32:55.387 --> 32:57.975
Just as Stanislav was
killed trying to protect it.

32:58.008 --> 33:00.815
Well, at least we know
where all the players are.

34:20.574 --> 34:23.375
Let us through. Move.

34:31.581 --> 34:32.902
Where are they?

34:32.936 --> 34:35.690
- What are you talking about?
- Your countrymen.

34:35.757 --> 34:37.132
Where are they?

34:37.791 --> 34:39.770
George. The Russians...

34:39.824 --> 34:42.094
- Watts, the Poles.
- Where are they?

34:45.577 --> 34:47.264
George. Watts.

34:47.320 --> 34:49.585
The most curious thing just occurred.

34:49.619 --> 34:51.155
Spit it out, Watts.

34:51.280 --> 34:54.491
A pair of knights just took off
in pursuit of a gang of Russians.

34:54.525 --> 34:58.080
- Which way?
- Down toward the waterfront. Just minutes ago.

35:00.674 --> 35:03.809
- What do you know about all this?
- We're just here to play chess.

35:03.855 --> 35:06.962
- You mean here to cheat at chess.
- You were doing the same.

35:06.996 --> 35:08.538
Throw them both in jail, Crabtree.

35:08.566 --> 35:10.495
Why? We did nothing wrong!

35:10.541 --> 35:12.769
Tell the owner I've
commandeered this animal.

35:12.820 --> 35:16.861
You there. I need that
bike. Toronto police.

35:46.235 --> 35:48.633
Hurry! Hurry!

35:59.259 --> 36:00.517
Whoa.

36:02.289 --> 36:04.250
That is not yours.

36:04.513 --> 36:07.096
You will die by the blade you covet.

36:07.157 --> 36:09.588
- It is almost poetic.
- Stop right there.

36:09.599 --> 36:12.417
Both of you step back
and drop your weapons now.

36:12.439 --> 36:15.245
- This is not your fight.
- This is still Toronto,

36:15.271 --> 36:16.849
and our laws still apply.

36:16.871 --> 36:19.393
You are under arrest for the
murder of Victor Stanislav.

36:19.409 --> 36:20.835
Stanislav was a murderer!

36:20.844 --> 36:23.880
He boasted to me about
killing Master Golahkov!

36:30.875 --> 36:32.523
Give the sword to me.

36:32.556 --> 36:34.927
It belongs to my country.
It will be returned.

36:34.949 --> 36:38.085
It belongs to us. It
was surrendered to us.

36:38.146 --> 36:39.829
And now we have it back.

36:42.261 --> 36:43.736
Well, this is a new one.

36:43.781 --> 36:45.635
Bloody hell, Murdoch. What's going on?

36:45.827 --> 36:48.599
I'm trying to get these
men to listen to reason.

36:48.622 --> 36:51.786
- I take it they won't?
- This sword belongs to the Kingdom of Poland.

36:51.825 --> 36:53.272
The sword is ours.

36:53.669 --> 36:56.313
And you want to fight
your war on Canadian soil?

36:56.346 --> 36:58.169
I want to bring the
sword back to Poland.

36:58.197 --> 37:01.478
I want my people to rally behind
it and reclaim our country.

37:01.489 --> 37:02.663
All right then.

37:02.993 --> 37:05.552
You want a bloody war. Have one.

37:05.742 --> 37:07.625
But they stole the sword from us!

37:07.653 --> 37:09.700
Killed my countrymen! Arrest them.

37:09.727 --> 37:11.561
And your countryman
killed one of theirs.

37:11.594 --> 37:13.297
As I see it, that's even.

37:13.329 --> 37:15.842
Now, you want that precious
sword, fight for it.

37:16.339 --> 37:18.574
- Kill for it.
- We are in the right.

37:18.601 --> 37:21.319
- Arrest them.
- One of them killed my countryman.

37:21.498 --> 37:24.382
Well, then this is
definitely your battle.

37:24.824 --> 37:26.137
Settle it.

37:40.023 --> 37:42.343
Your country is defeated anyway.

37:43.522 --> 37:46.936
And one day the
Bolsheviks will take yours.

38:11.054 --> 38:12.655
You're free to go.

38:13.242 --> 38:14.758
The Russians?

38:14.791 --> 38:16.547
They are as well,

38:16.596 --> 38:19.396
save for the man who
killed Victor Stanislav.

38:19.429 --> 38:21.011
And the Szczerbiec?

38:21.745 --> 38:24.302
A sword will be sent to St. Petersburg,

38:24.330 --> 38:27.803
one bearing a remarkable
resemblance to the Szczerbiec.

38:28.530 --> 38:30.451
But this one is yours.

38:31.640 --> 38:34.334
How do you know I will not
return to Poland with it?

38:35.100 --> 38:37.613
No one will believe you
possess the true one.

38:37.646 --> 38:39.482
But if they do?

38:41.522 --> 38:43.792
Then you will be
responsible for the deaths

38:43.820 --> 38:45.933
of thousands of your countrymen.

38:48.958 --> 38:50.975
I don't believe you to be that man.

39:07.510 --> 39:09.589
Are you sure you did
the right thing, William?

39:09.714 --> 39:11.299
His ticket hasn't been used.

39:11.333 --> 39:13.583
He's staying in Toronto
for the time being.

39:13.617 --> 39:15.391
He may change his mind.

39:15.619 --> 39:18.873
People always seem willing
to die for useless symbols.

39:18.998 --> 39:20.600
He wasn't willing to kill for it.

39:20.617 --> 39:23.226
I very much doubt he would
want others to die for it.

39:25.390 --> 39:26.663
Julia...

39:26.695 --> 39:28.375
Don't look now, but

39:28.806 --> 39:31.360
everyone is staring at us.

39:36.285 --> 39:38.976
- Do you think they know?
- I haven't told anyone.

39:39.009 --> 39:40.762
Nor have I.

39:41.244 --> 39:45.496
Although Miss Hart did
guess that I was with child.

39:45.927 --> 39:49.318
And the Inspector did counsel
me to get plenty of rest.

39:49.671 --> 39:53.190
He told me to take one
last flight of fancy.

39:53.222 --> 39:55.759
- So they know?
- Did Miss Hart tell them?

39:56.032 --> 39:57.804
I very much doubt it.

39:59.409 --> 40:00.974
The microphone.

40:01.857 --> 40:04.154
We were listening to
the baby's heartbeat.

40:04.187 --> 40:06.335
George must have
overheard our conversation.

40:06.619 --> 40:08.105
I see.

40:09.123 --> 40:12.873
Well, I don't much fancy being
stared at for the next five months.

40:13.192 --> 40:14.645
Julia...

40:15.198 --> 40:16.562
Inspector,

40:16.590 --> 40:18.977
I couldn't help but notice
that you and all of the men

40:19.010 --> 40:20.922
were staring at us both.

40:21.257 --> 40:23.153
Is there something you'd like to ask us?

40:23.186 --> 40:25.410
Uh, no...

40:26.321 --> 40:27.859
Constable Crabtree?

40:27.875 --> 40:30.391
What?

40:31.594 --> 40:33.795
- Higgins?
- No, ma'am.

40:35.857 --> 40:37.366
What about you,

40:37.400 --> 40:39.810
Detective Watts? You seem
like a curious fellow.

40:39.849 --> 40:41.983
Well, there is one thing.

40:42.598 --> 40:44.990
- What is that?
- When's the baby coming?

40:45.012 --> 40:47.119
Bloody hell, Watts.

40:47.142 --> 40:48.657
They wanted to keep it a secret.

40:48.685 --> 40:50.870
How could they do that
when everyone clearly knows

40:50.893 --> 40:53.268
- what's going on here?
- How indeed?

40:53.302 --> 40:55.280
Yes, we are very happy to announce

40:55.318 --> 40:57.448
that we are having a baby.

40:57.627 --> 40:59.583
Well, now that the cat's out of the bag,

40:59.617 --> 41:01.366
congratulations to the pair of ya.

41:01.383 --> 41:04.256
Excellent news, sir! Wonderful.

41:04.709 --> 41:06.324
George.

41:09.784 --> 41:11.701
A busy night ahead, Miss Hart?

41:11.735 --> 41:14.771
Yes. I've been speaking
with my anatomy professor.

41:14.804 --> 41:17.139
He's given me permission
to accelerate my studies.

41:17.172 --> 41:18.945
I could be finished within the month.

41:19.070 --> 41:20.973
Why would you want to do that?

41:21.024 --> 41:23.590
You're so young. Enjoy your life.

41:23.662 --> 41:25.658
I already do, thank you.

41:25.965 --> 41:29.052
But I have to do this if I am
to warrant full consideration.

41:29.085 --> 41:30.787
Full consideration for what?

41:31.505 --> 41:33.466
Well... your job.

41:33.517 --> 41:36.166
I assume you'll be taking
leave after you have your child.

41:36.992 --> 41:39.307
Well, I hadn't thought...

41:39.385 --> 41:41.242
Excuse me for being presumptuous...

41:41.255 --> 41:43.888
Well, I suppose I will
need to take some time.

41:44.751 --> 41:47.188
And, who knows, maybe I'll fall
so in love with the little one

41:47.197 --> 41:48.758
I'll never want to come back.

41:48.771 --> 41:51.190
Well, whatever it is that you
decide, I just want to let you know

41:51.208 --> 41:53.109
that I'm more than
able to take your place.

41:53.694 --> 41:54.745
Well,

41:54.767 --> 41:57.472
you did say you weren't
going to work for me forever.

41:57.508 --> 41:59.949
Yes, I did say that, didn't I?

42:07.014 --> 42:08.074
Good night.

42:09.215 --> 42:10.802
Good night, Miss Hart.

42:18.560 --> 42:20.010
Let us out!

42:20.135 --> 42:22.454
Hey! Let us out!

42:22.517 --> 42:23.787
Miss Troubetskoy,

42:24.243 --> 42:25.687
you and your father

42:25.732 --> 42:27.991
will be released first
thing in the morning.

42:28.648 --> 42:30.054
Until then,

42:30.356 --> 42:32.121
after all that's happened,

42:34.684 --> 42:36.286
it would be my honour

42:36.411 --> 42:38.352
if we could see

42:38.647 --> 42:40.739
the two real masters at play.

42:42.359 --> 42:44.143
Miss Bloom, would you join us?

42:44.908 --> 42:46.605
It would be my honour.

42:46.906 --> 42:49.016
And I will enjoy defeating you.

42:49.624 --> 42:51.567
Already engaging in gamesmanship?

42:51.601 --> 42:53.259
- Just letting you know the truth.
- Oh.

42:53.308 --> 42:56.188
- So you can predict the future.
- It seems readily apparent.

42:56.886 --> 42:59.438
- What colour would you like?
- You choose.

43:09.097 --> 43:10.296
What do you say, sir.

43:10.421 --> 43:12.055
Fancy a nip while we watch?

43:12.088 --> 43:13.461
Poyekhali.

43:21.063 --> 43:22.328
Queen's Gambit.

43:22.734 --> 43:24.814
Did you really think I would accept it?

43:25.909 --> 43:27.193
Queen's Gambit.

43:27.318 --> 43:28.584
You know, Troubetskoy,

43:28.605 --> 43:31.204
whoever decided the queen
