00:19.978 --> 00:21.854
My name's Louden, Louden Swain.

00:22.064 --> 00:24.357
Last week, I turned 18.

00:24.566 --> 00:26.359
I wasn't ready for it.

00:26.568 --> 00:28.861
I haven't done anything yet.

00:29.071 --> 00:31.865
So I made this deal with myself.

00:32.073 --> 00:34.868
This is the year I make my mark.

00:35.077 --> 00:36.369
All right, fellas.

00:36.578 --> 00:38.871
It should be clear to all of us

00:39.081 --> 00:40.373
that we've got the makings

00:40.582 --> 00:42.000
of a championship
squad this year.

00:42.209 --> 00:43.501
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

00:44.711 --> 00:47.088
As most of you know,
once a week,

00:47.297 --> 00:49.090
we have wrestle-offs
for varsity position.

00:49.299 --> 00:51.592
For you new fellows
who just joined us,

00:51.802 --> 00:54.596
it's the fairest
thing in the world.

00:54.805 --> 00:58.934
Any man who can beat the
number-one man at his weight class

00:59.142 --> 01:02.895
gets to wrestle varsity
at that position.

01:03.105 --> 01:04.438
Anyone who wants to challenge

01:04.647 --> 01:07.442
the number-one man
in his weight class,

01:07.651 --> 01:09.319
raise your hand.

01:17.244 --> 01:21.164
Louden, you're already
number one at 190.

01:22.416 --> 01:24.918
I know. I want to
wrestle off for 178.

01:25.127 --> 01:26.628
What's this shit, man?

01:26.837 --> 01:28.129
You dropped to 178?

01:28.338 --> 01:29.630
Stay in your own division.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.383
I ain't giving up my spot.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.885
How did you drop the weight?

01:34.094 --> 01:35.386
Just working out.

01:35.596 --> 01:36.888
Ok. Billy, I want you

01:37.097 --> 01:38.973
to run the skills drill for me.

01:39.182 --> 01:40.975
Louden, I want a word with you.

01:41.184 --> 01:43.978
Ok, guys. Go and
get your headgear

01:44.187 --> 01:46.397
and get paired up, ok?

01:49.401 --> 01:50.944
What's going on?

01:51.153 --> 01:52.445
I want to drop a weight.

01:52.654 --> 01:54.447
Why make life
difficult on yourself?

01:54.656 --> 01:56.449
I'm going to drop
two weights, coach.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.534
I'm serious.
I want to wrestle 168.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.496
Look, it was easy
to drop 12 pounds.

02:01.705 --> 02:04.499
You only had to wring the
water out of your system.

02:04.708 --> 02:07.335
I'm going to wrestle
Shute this year, coach.

02:07.544 --> 02:10.338
Shute? Nobody wants
to wrestle Shute.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.340
Louden, you're out of your mind.

02:12.549 --> 02:15.134
To tell you the truth,
I kind of worry about that.

02:15.344 --> 02:18.138
I'm going to let you wrestle
off against Kuch at 178,

02:18.347 --> 02:20.015
but if he kicks your butt,

02:20.223 --> 02:22.683
I want you to put those
pounds right back on.

02:22.893 --> 02:23.893
All right.

02:24.061 --> 02:26.980
Number-one man,
cross leg single.

02:27.189 --> 02:28.481
All right, on the whistle.

02:28.690 --> 02:29.690
First round.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.032
Come on, Kuch!

02:37.240 --> 02:38.866
Come on, Kuch!

02:53.256 --> 02:55.424
Drive him over!

I can't believe
they actually pay me

05:08.225 --> 05:09.517
to work here.

05:09.726 --> 05:12.186
Neither can I, kid.
What have we got here?

05:12.395 --> 05:14.188
Two lemon pies and a coffee.

05:14.397 --> 05:16.273
I guess I can handle that.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.697
Did you make your big
announcement yet?

05:22.906 --> 05:25.366
I told the coach
I was down to 178.

05:25.575 --> 05:26.867
He pulled me aside.

05:27.077 --> 05:29.704
I told him the whole story.

05:29.913 --> 05:31.289
Did he shit?

05:32.499 --> 05:34.375
Yeah, slightly.

05:34.584 --> 05:37.795
Slightly? You're too much.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.717
Hey, Elmo, you think I'm crazy?

05:42.926 --> 05:45.219
I pretty much have the feeling

05:45.428 --> 05:47.721
that's going to be
the consensus on this.

05:47.931 --> 05:49.057
I don't know.

05:49.266 --> 05:50.558
Is this Shute character

05:50.767 --> 05:52.226
the terror they say he is?

05:52.435 --> 05:53.811
Yeah, he's pretty bad.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.233
Well, in that case,

05:58.441 --> 06:01.235
this might be a move a
reasonable man would avoid.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.320
You could end up
getting crippled.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.157
You think so, huh?

06:10.245 --> 06:11.245
Room service.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.081
Come on in. It's open.

06:21.047 --> 06:22.673
Just put it down.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.773
I'll sign that now.

06:38.982 --> 06:40.274
What is that stuff?

06:40.483 --> 06:43.277
Tai Chi chi... national form
of exercise in China.

06:43.486 --> 06:46.280
I'm going to put your
tip on this, ok?

06:46.489 --> 06:48.282
Can you get a workout that way?

06:48.491 --> 06:51.076
800 million Chinese
can't be wrong.

06:51.286 --> 06:54.580
It's mainly a matter of getting
the mind into the muscles.

06:54.789 --> 06:56.874
I use it when I'm on the road.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.793
It helps me sleep like a baby.

06:59.002 --> 07:00.002
Really?

07:00.086 --> 07:02.296
I'm on a 600-calorie-a-day diet,

07:02.505 --> 07:04.590
working out like a madman.

07:04.799 --> 07:06.959
I'm so wired when I hit the
rack, I can't sleep at all.

07:06.983 --> 07:09.554
I lie there for about six hours

07:09.763 --> 07:11.556
thinking about my life and stuff

07:11.765 --> 07:13.558
before I finally drop off.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.226
My name is Kevin.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.145
Louden. Louden Swain.

07:17.354 --> 07:19.647
Let me show you
how it's done, Louden.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.984
It'll help you sleep.

07:25.028 --> 07:26.487
All right.

07:29.532 --> 07:31.408
Stand there. Face this way.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.411
Just sort of catch me

07:33.620 --> 07:36.331
out of the corner of your eyes.

07:36.539 --> 07:39.124
Ok, now breathe in.

07:39.334 --> 07:40.835
Raise the arms.

07:41.044 --> 07:43.838
Keep the movements slow, fluid.

07:44.047 --> 07:45.339
Breathe out.

07:45.548 --> 07:48.342
Shift your weight to the left.

07:48.551 --> 07:50.344
Step onto the right.

07:50.553 --> 07:53.347
Stack your hands over the knee.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.432
Step back to the left.
Move your arms.

07:55.642 --> 07:56.934
Step back to the left.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.937
Stack your arms the other way.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.605
Step out.

08:07.070 --> 08:09.030
I think I got it now.

08:09.239 --> 08:10.949
I'll try it on my own
when I get a chance.

08:11.157 --> 08:12.950
Do you want to come up later?

08:13.159 --> 08:14.952
No. I don't think so.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.537
I got to get home.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.372
I'm in training.

08:18.581 --> 08:20.541
Training, huh? What sport?

08:20.750 --> 08:21.876
Wrestling.

08:22.085 --> 08:23.085
Wrestling.

08:23.253 --> 08:24.613
I sell sporting goods
for a living.

08:24.637 --> 08:27.464
As a matter of fact,
I carry wrestling shoes.

08:27.674 --> 08:30.551
Just leave the tray by the
door when you're finished.

09:16.222 --> 09:17.598
Hey, Kuch.

09:17.807 --> 09:20.601
You kicked the holy-living
shit out of me today.

09:20.810 --> 09:23.604
I guess I was just
really up for it.

09:23.813 --> 09:25.133
Besides, you weren't
at your best.

09:25.315 --> 09:27.859
Only had the worst off-day
of my whole life.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.611
Like I said.

09:29.819 --> 09:33.531
Shit. I couldn't beat
you on my best day.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.617
You work there, in that hotel?

09:36.826 --> 09:38.285
Yeah, I deliver room service.

09:38.495 --> 09:40.455
Yeah? You get
any pussy that way?

09:42.499 --> 09:43.791
Not yet.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.043
A guy tonight tried to
grab my wad, though.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.544
Kind of actually grabbed it,

09:47.754 --> 09:49.714
if you want to know the truth.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.049
What did you do?

09:51.257 --> 09:53.050
Took off. I was
a little freaked.

09:53.259 --> 09:54.635
Nobody ever tried that before.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.555
Kuch, forget about today.

09:57.764 --> 10:00.641
You'll be wrestling first
in the 178$ before long.

10:00.850 --> 10:01.892
Oh, yeah?

10:02.102 --> 10:03.978
Cut me a clue, man.
How do I do that?

10:04.187 --> 10:06.564
I ain't going to be in
that division too long.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.232
No shit?

10:08.441 --> 10:10.234
This is like a gift.

10:10.443 --> 10:13.988
Hey, Kuch never
forgets a gift, man.

10:14.197 --> 10:15.990
Yo, Louden!

10:16.199 --> 10:19.493
Hey, man, where are
you going to be?

10:19.702 --> 10:21.078
I'm dropping down to 168.

10:21.287 --> 10:23.080
I'm going to take on Shute.

10:23.289 --> 10:24.498
Shute?

10:24.707 --> 10:26.583
Shute's a monster, man.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.503
A genuine teratoid.

10:28.711 --> 10:29.753
Get real.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.757
His father has to
use a live wire

10:32.966 --> 10:34.926
to keep him from
fucking the fireplace.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.845
Yeah, I know about all that.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.846
I'm going to lose the weight

10:39.055 --> 10:40.598
and get down
on the mat with him.

10:40.807 --> 10:41.807
Like, why?

10:41.891 --> 10:43.350
It's now or never.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.353
I'd keep this thing
a big secret.

10:45.562 --> 10:47.355
This isn't the kind of thing

10:47.564 --> 10:49.357
you want everybody
to know about.

10:49.566 --> 10:51.359
I wouldn't want Shute to know.

10:51.568 --> 10:54.612
I told the coach, a guy I
work with, and now you.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.531
It's an honor, man.

10:56.739 --> 10:59.199

11:33.026 --> 11:36.320
Our man at 190
says he's dropping to 168...

11:36.529 --> 11:39.823
Are you ready for this...
To wrestle the Shute.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.826

live to enjoy it.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.123
Thanks.

12:29.292 --> 12:31.372
I loved your article on
interossei and lumbricales...

12:31.396 --> 12:33.461
"those unsung muscles
of a good grip."

12:33.670 --> 12:36.422
I don't know if anyone gives a fuck,

12:39.634 --> 12:41.761
I haven't decided on a subject yet.

12:41.970 --> 12:43.429
Maybe the sternocleidomastoid.

12:43.638 --> 12:44.638
The what?

12:44.806 --> 12:45.806
Oh, yeah!

12:45.974 --> 12:48.476
Hey, why not? Go for it!

12:48.685 --> 12:50.144
Hey, Mr. Tanneran.

12:50.353 --> 12:51.353
Hey, Louden.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.648
You ought to try jumping rope.

12:54.857 --> 12:56.650
It's great for the
cardiovascular system.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.026
Shit.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.325
I'm hearing strange things about you.

13:04.534 --> 13:06.327
It's getting blown
out of proportion.

13:06.536 --> 13:08.329
Come on, man. I'll guard you.

13:08.538 --> 13:10.498
I'm an animal on defense.

13:10.707 --> 13:12.291
All right.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.418
Are you ready, animal? Yaah!

13:16.629 --> 13:18.005
You take one.

13:18.214 --> 13:20.507
Ever hear of Tai Chi?

13:20.717 --> 13:22.009
What's that, a Chinese thing?

13:22.218 --> 13:23.802
Can 800 million people be wrong?

13:24.012 --> 13:25.054
Frequently.

13:28.099 --> 13:29.975
I got to go to wrestling practice.

13:30.184 --> 13:32.686
Otherwise, I'd show you
how to play the game.

13:32.895 --> 13:34.438
Hey, Louden.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.007
Maybe you're overextending
yourself on this Shute challenge.

13:37.031 --> 13:37.775
Definitely.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.611
You have a tendency to do that.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.613
Sometimes, you got to. Remember?

13:42.822 --> 13:44.698
This is one of them times.

13:45.950 --> 13:48.285
Today's the day, Otto.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.120
Keep your hands in front.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.622
Don't straighten your arms.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.624
You got it!

13:53.833 --> 13:55.626
You got it! You got it!

13:55.835 --> 13:57.127
You're dogging it!

13:57.337 --> 13:59.464
You're dogging it, lard ass!

13:59.672 --> 14:01.465
Come on! Come on!

14:01.674 --> 14:03.509
Come on, you wimp!

14:03.718 --> 14:05.010
Come on, you pussy!

14:05.219 --> 14:07.512
Come on, you pussy!

14:07.722 --> 14:09.598
Come on! You're losing it!

14:10.933 --> 14:12.100
You wimp!

14:18.733 --> 14:21.610
All right, fellows,
let's circle up here.

14:31.788 --> 14:33.331
All right.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.832
Columbia high graduated two seniors

14:36.042 --> 14:38.544
from last year's squad.

14:38.753 --> 14:42.089
So we can bet that they're
going to be agile...

14:48.304 --> 14:50.180
Hey, man, what's happening?

14:50.390 --> 14:54.890
Agile, mobile, and hostile this season.

14:55.103 --> 14:56.395
That was a great idea

14:56.604 --> 14:57.896
about keeping everything secret.

14:58.106 --> 14:59.106
I'm sorry.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.692
It was too good
to keep to myself.

15:01.901 --> 15:05.195
I had a talk last night with
the everywhere spirit.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.198
Looks like you talked
with everybody.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.407
With who?

15:08.574 --> 15:09.866
The everywhere spirit.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.076
Kuch!

15:16.207 --> 15:18.209
Now, fellas, if a Columbia wrestler

15:18.418 --> 15:20.711
gets you at a disadvantage

15:20.920 --> 15:23.213
and breaks you down flat,

15:23.423 --> 15:26.300
he'll put this move on you.

15:29.220 --> 15:31.597
This is a trademark
over there at Columbia.

15:31.806 --> 15:32.806
Right, Kuch?

15:32.849 --> 15:33.849
Yep.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.268
Can we see that again, coach?

15:36.477 --> 15:39.271
We all remember how
we counter this, right?

15:39.480 --> 15:40.147
Yeah. Yeah.

15:40.356 --> 15:41.398
All right. Let's pair off

15:41.607 --> 15:44.526
and practice countering this move.

15:50.908 --> 15:53.493
Now, the bottom man is active.

15:55.538 --> 15:57.915
Head back. There you go.

15:58.124 --> 16:01.293
There you go. That's it.

16:01.502 --> 16:03.795
You knew I was half Indian, huh?

16:04.005 --> 16:06.424
Yeah. I figured it was
something like that.

16:06.632 --> 16:08.467
I figured you'd need big medicine

16:08.676 --> 16:09.802
to go after Shute.

16:10.011 --> 16:11.971
So last night, I smoked the pipe,

16:12.180 --> 16:14.891
and I had a session with
the everywhere spirit.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.521
That's when
it was revealed to me

16:20.730 --> 16:22.106
what you're really doing.

16:24.275 --> 16:25.275
Uhh!

16:25.359 --> 16:26.151
Yeah?

16:26.360 --> 16:27.152
Yeah.

16:27.361 --> 16:28.653
What am I really doing?

16:28.863 --> 16:30.155
You're on a vision quest, man.

16:30.364 --> 16:33.241
You're trying to find
your place in the circle.

16:35.620 --> 16:38.664
I just want to
wrestle Shute, ok?

16:38.873 --> 16:40.916
Ok, ok.

16:41.959 --> 16:42.960
What's happening?

16:43.169 --> 16:45.129
He broke my tooth!

16:45.338 --> 16:48.382
You sold me a lemon, asshole.

16:48.591 --> 16:51.176
Hey, look at this.

16:51.385 --> 16:52.677
You got what you deserved.

16:52.887 --> 16:54.805
Let's get back to work now.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.515
What happened?

16:56.724 --> 16:58.392
Ask your old man.

16:58.601 --> 17:00.394
I don't mind a man making money.

17:00.603 --> 17:02.730
I don't want him stealing it.

17:02.939 --> 17:03.981
Get a good eyeful?

17:04.190 --> 17:05.482
You all right?

17:05.691 --> 17:07.858
Yeah. Take her
down to Ferguson's

17:08.069 --> 17:09.862
and buy her a hamburger.

17:10.070 --> 17:11.864
I'll be along in a minute.

17:12.073 --> 17:13.866
What about my car?

17:14.075 --> 17:16.160
I'll take care of it.

17:16.368 --> 17:18.496
Look, folks,
the show's over, ok?

17:24.627 --> 17:27.503
Some people just see
you coming, I guess.

17:27.713 --> 17:30.382
They take one look
at you and say,

17:30.591 --> 17:31.883
"oh, boy. Fresh meat."

17:32.093 --> 17:34.011
Who the hell are you?

17:34.220 --> 17:35.512
Louden. Louden Swain.

17:35.721 --> 17:38.515
My father, he was the
one with the punch.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.517
You're not from
around here, are you?

17:40.726 --> 17:42.185
What, are you kidding me?

17:42.395 --> 17:44.021
Trenton, New Jersey.

17:44.230 --> 17:47.024
Why do you look so funny?

17:47.233 --> 17:48.525
I'm wearing a rubber suit.

17:48.734 --> 17:51.027
I'm a wrestler. I'm
trying to lose weight.

17:51.237 --> 17:52.613
Ok. I got it.

17:59.537 --> 18:01.413
Onions on that?

18:01.622 --> 18:03.040
Yeah. Lots of them.

18:03.249 --> 18:04.541
Anything for you, Louden?

18:04.750 --> 18:06.042
Just ice water, Elsie.

18:06.252 --> 18:07.920
Just ice water.

18:08.129 --> 18:12.049
What are you doing
here from New Jersey?

18:12.258 --> 18:14.551
Going to California.
San Francisco.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.052
I got sick of hitching,

18:16.262 --> 18:19.098
so I put all my money
into the car.

18:19.307 --> 18:20.433
Brilliant.

18:20.641 --> 18:21.933
Who's in San Francisco?

18:22.143 --> 18:23.936
Me... When I get there.

18:24.145 --> 18:26.105
You got a job there?

18:26.314 --> 18:27.634
You don't have to
know everything.

18:27.815 --> 18:29.066
Who the hell are you?

18:29.275 --> 18:31.568
I told you. Louden Swain.

18:31.777 --> 18:33.069
See, I'm just naturally curious.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.739
I'm going to be a
doctor in outer space.

18:35.948 --> 18:39.952
Good. You won't have to
know a thing about me.

18:40.161 --> 18:41.954
I'll be stuck on earth.

18:42.163 --> 18:43.956
I'm 18, by the way...

18:44.165 --> 18:45.958
Draft age, as of three days ago.

18:46.167 --> 18:48.419
I was wondering
how old you were.

18:50.212 --> 18:51.963
21.

18:52.173 --> 18:54.842
I've been 21 since I was 14.

18:56.052 --> 18:57.094
Hey, Larry.

18:57.303 --> 18:59.888
Hi, Elsie, bill.

19:07.104 --> 19:10.107
That's the first time
I've hit a man in anger

19:10.316 --> 19:12.609
since I was Louden's age.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.986
Sorry. I didn't catch your name.

19:15.196 --> 19:15.988
It's Carla.

19:16.197 --> 19:17.489
So, what did they say?

19:17.698 --> 19:19.366
Like, Mr. Edwards, especially.

19:19.575 --> 19:20.993
I've looked for jobs before.

19:21.202 --> 19:22.995
Oh, great. You've been fired.

19:23.204 --> 19:24.496
Shit. I'm sorry.

19:24.705 --> 19:26.498
I didn't want you to lose a job.

19:26.707 --> 19:27.708
Me, neither.

19:27.917 --> 19:30.210
Where are you
going to get another job?

19:30.419 --> 19:33.380
They should've fired that
other guy passing off junk.

19:33.589 --> 19:35.549
Will I get my money back?

19:35.758 --> 19:38.510
Hell, no. They don't
operate that way.

19:38.719 --> 19:41.304
That lemon and 20
bucks was all I had.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.307
Pop, can I talk to you a minute?

19:43.516 --> 19:45.809
Sure. Oh, you mean private?

19:46.018 --> 19:47.018
Yeah.

19:47.061 --> 19:48.228
Excuse us.

19:50.606 --> 19:54.985
Elsie, I'll have two eggs,
toast, and black coffee.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.486
You got it, Larry.

19:56.696 --> 19:59.448
Beating up on guys
makes you hungry.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.997
I'll get another
job. Don't worry.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.874
It's not that. It's her.

20:09.083 --> 20:10.876
She doesn't have
any transportation

20:11.085 --> 20:12.211
or anyplace to stay.

20:12.420 --> 20:15.214
Maybe we could ask her
to stay with us

20:15.423 --> 20:17.591
till you fix the car
or whatever.

20:17.800 --> 20:20.594
This girl's been around
the block a few times.

20:20.803 --> 20:23.096
We don't know a thing about her.

20:23.305 --> 20:24.597
She's from New Jersey.

20:24.807 --> 20:26.683
She's on her way to California.

20:35.025 --> 20:37.902
Just so you realize
she's her own person,

20:38.112 --> 20:39.404
not some puppy we found.

20:39.613 --> 20:40.864
Yeah.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.116
It's just helping someone
who's had bad luck.

20:43.325 --> 20:44.701
That's all I'm saying.

20:55.755 --> 21:00.255
Carla, have you got
a place to stay?

21:00.509 --> 21:03.929
I was planning on leaving
this dump in my own car.

21:04.138 --> 21:06.431
If you want to,
you can stay with us.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.434
Come and go as you please.

21:09.643 --> 21:11.311
You'd do that?

21:14.440 --> 21:15.441
Why?

21:15.649 --> 21:16.941
Where we come from,

21:17.151 --> 21:19.319
people believe in
helping each other.

21:19.528 --> 21:21.947
Don't worry. I can
take care of myself.

21:22.156 --> 21:25.492
You've got a place
if you want it.

21:25.659 --> 21:28.953
What about your wife?
What's she going to say?

21:29.872 --> 21:32.541
She doesn't live
with us anymore.

21:42.593 --> 21:45.470
Not much into decor, are you?

21:45.679 --> 21:48.973
I spend most of the
time in the basement.

21:49.183 --> 21:51.476
I'll make some room
for you in here.

21:51.685 --> 21:53.603
Is this a problem for anybody?

21:53.813 --> 21:54.813
What?

21:54.897 --> 21:56.315
Is this a problem for anybody?

21:56.524 --> 21:57.608
No.

22:01.904 --> 22:04.281
I won those last year.

22:04.490 --> 22:07.784
I was a natural,
first year and all.

22:07.993 --> 22:10.954
I got to the state
quarter-finals,

22:11.163 --> 22:12.956
which everybody said
was pretty amazing

22:13.165 --> 22:14.875
for a first-year wrestler.

22:15.084 --> 22:17.002
See...

22:17.211 --> 22:19.004
The thing is my balance.

22:19.213 --> 22:21.006
It's more important
than strength or speed.

22:21.215 --> 22:23.055
You've got to feel where
the other guy's going.

22:23.217 --> 22:25.010
Then you use his
strength against him,

22:25.219 --> 22:27.012
if you've got perfect balance,

22:27.221 --> 22:28.513
which I do.

22:28.722 --> 22:30.014
I've got kinesthetic awareness.

22:30.224 --> 22:32.392
I always know where my body is

22:32.601 --> 22:34.644
in relation to...

22:41.318 --> 22:42.610
Louden?

22:44.154 --> 22:46.114
She fell asleep.

22:48.158 --> 22:51.161
Let's turn out the light
and let her sleep.

23:03.173 --> 23:05.049
Well, 11:00, kid.

23:05.259 --> 23:08.720
Another day down the
tubes and gone forever.

23:08.929 --> 23:11.056
1...

23:11.265 --> 23:13.058
2...

23:13.267 --> 23:14.309
3-

23:19.523 --> 23:21.149
Elmo...

23:23.027 --> 23:25.946
I'm thinking of becoming
an exobiologist.

23:26.155 --> 23:29.074
I thought you wanted
to become a doctor.

23:29.283 --> 23:31.535
That's the beauty
of it. I can be...

23:31.744 --> 23:34.580
You know, like a
doctor in outer space...

23:34.788 --> 23:37.582
If I get a wrestling scholarship

23:37.791 --> 23:41.836
and if there's enough
money for the rest.

23:48.719 --> 23:51.179
Jesus, it could
give you a headache.

23:57.728 --> 24:01.606
Well... There's
always tomorrow, kid.

24:01.815 --> 24:04.192
That's my motto in life.

24:09.239 --> 24:10.239
Hey, Louden!

24:10.366 --> 24:12.117
Kuch, what are you doing here?

24:12.326 --> 24:14.119
I'm going to pace you, remember?

24:14.328 --> 24:16.288
Help you train for the monster.

24:16.497 --> 24:18.123
Jeez, I forgot. I'm sorry.

24:18.332 --> 24:21.960
What? How could you forget
something like that?

24:22.169 --> 24:24.963
How can you think
about anything else?

24:25.172 --> 24:27.465
Give me a ride home
on your bike.

24:27.675 --> 24:28.967
I'm in a hurry.

24:29.176 --> 24:31.469
Riding a bike
don't burn off weight.

24:31.679 --> 24:33.972
That ain't the way
to beat Shute.

24:34.181 --> 24:35.473
Just for tonight, all right?

24:35.683 --> 24:36.975
We'll make it up tomorrow.

24:37.184 --> 24:38.977
Ok, but you run the risk

24:39.186 --> 24:40.979
of pissing off the spirits, man,

24:41.188 --> 24:43.481
which is not the thing to do.

24:43.691 --> 24:45.067
Nice shoes, man.

25:02.751 --> 25:04.169
See you tomorrow in school.

25:04.378 --> 25:06.046
I could go for a beer.

25:06.255 --> 25:08.340
Oh, my father doesn't let me.

25:08.549 --> 25:10.092
Cup of coffee, then.

25:11.468 --> 25:13.761
All right. A cup of coffee.

25:18.475 --> 25:21.936
We got someone staying
with us, by the way.

25:26.316 --> 25:27.692
I've been asking about Shute.

25:27.901 --> 25:29.193
That son of a bitch

25:29.403 --> 25:31.696
is definitely tougher
than he was last year.

25:31.905 --> 25:33.031
Where'd you hear that?

25:33.240 --> 25:34.532
When he pins a guy now,

25:34.742 --> 25:36.535
his coach has to keep him

25:36.744 --> 25:38.370
from biting
the guy's throat off.

25:38.579 --> 25:39.871
That's what I hear.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.372
How about instant coffee?

25:41.582 --> 25:43.041
Yeah, man. Make it strong.

25:44.251 --> 25:45.752
Oh, hi.

25:45.919 --> 25:46.919
Hi.

25:46.962 --> 25:47.754
Where's pop?

25:47.963 --> 25:48.963
He's asleep.

25:49.089 --> 25:50.840
I thought maybe
you were sleeping

25:51.050 --> 25:53.844
'cause you were sleeping
when I went to work.

25:54.053 --> 25:55.345
Yeah. I was beat.

25:55.554 --> 25:56.846
Mind if I take one?

25:57.056 --> 25:59.767
No. Oh, um, Carla...

25:59.975 --> 26:01.267
This here's Kuch.

26:01.477 --> 26:02.269
Hi.

26:02.478 --> 26:03.270
Hi.

26:03.479 --> 26:04.771
Kuch is like my white name.

26:04.980 --> 26:06.439
My Indian name is swift elk.

26:06.648 --> 26:08.358
I'm half Indian
on my mother's side.

26:08.567 --> 26:09.859
No shit.

26:10.069 --> 26:11.361
Good night, guys.

26:11.570 --> 26:12.570
Good night.

26:12.738 --> 26:13.864
You meatman.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.033
Now I know how you're
losing that weight.

26:17.659 --> 26:20.870
Uh, we're going to
make some coffee

26:21.080 --> 26:22.790
if you'd like to have some.

26:22.998 --> 26:24.541
No, thanks. It'll keep me up.

26:24.750 --> 26:26.126
Can I have a spoon?

26:31.840 --> 26:33.633
Thanks.

26:33.842 --> 26:35.885
Good night.

26:36.095 --> 26:37.888
Who is that girl?

27:03.705 --> 27:05.665
N lunatic fringe ♪

27:08.085 --> 27:10.670
n' I know
you're out there... un'?

27:18.971 --> 27:20.013
Good morning.

27:20.222 --> 27:21.932
You got any garlic salt?

27:22.141 --> 27:24.017
Yeah. Somewhere in there.

27:29.606 --> 27:30.982
Thanks.

27:31.191 --> 27:33.026
You like it like this?

27:33.235 --> 27:36.029
Yeah, I love it like this.

27:36.238 --> 27:40.738
You want to know why I'm
going to San Francisco?

27:41.243 --> 27:42.953
I'm going to be an artist.

27:43.162 --> 27:44.955
Isn't that hilarious?

27:45.164 --> 27:45.956
Me?

27:46.165 --> 27:47.958
What kind of artist?

27:48.167 --> 27:49.459
A good one.

27:49.668 --> 27:50.960
You know, canvas and paint.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.462
That kind of artist.

27:52.671 --> 27:55.465
I guess San Francisco's
the place to do it.

27:55.674 --> 27:56.966
You're absolutely right.

27:57.176 --> 28:00.971
Think of me as a person
who wants to be artist.

28:01.180 --> 28:03.682
I'm not one yet,
but I'm going to be.

28:03.891 --> 28:05.976
I'm glad you told me about this.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.562
Good morning. How did you sleep?

28:08.770 --> 28:09.896
Really good. Sit down.

28:10.105 --> 28:11.231
Breakfast is almost ready.

28:11.440 --> 28:12.566
None for me, thanks.

28:12.733 --> 28:14.568
You don't have to wait on us.

28:14.776 --> 28:15.776
That's all right.

28:15.944 --> 28:17.070
We don't expect it.

28:17.279 --> 28:19.072
We're used to
doing for ourselves.

28:19.281 --> 28:21.574
I just want to contribute.
Do you mind?

28:21.783 --> 28:24.076
Of course not.
Knock yourself out.

28:24.286 --> 28:25.286
Sit down.

28:25.454 --> 28:27.998
I better be getting
off to school.

28:28.207 --> 28:30.500
Get something
in your stomach first.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.001
It's cold out.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.504
It's just that I don't eat much.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.089
Sit down.

28:40.135 --> 28:44.514
So... What ever happened
to the lady of the house?

28:44.723 --> 28:46.015
You mean Louden's mother?

28:46.225 --> 28:49.519
She left not long after
they foreclosed on the farm.

28:49.728 --> 28:52.522
It wasn't what they'd
call a real good year.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.023
Another man was involved.

28:54.233 --> 28:57.027
Why do you always
got to talk about it?

28:57.236 --> 28:59.529
Are you proud of it, or what?

28:59.738 --> 29:01.197
I'm not ashamed of it.

29:01.406 --> 29:02.782
It just happened.

29:09.998 --> 29:12.375
How's it feel, breaking
up with your hand

29:12.584 --> 29:13.876
after all these years?

29:14.086 --> 29:16.379
Live-in gash, right
under your own roof.

29:16.588 --> 29:17.714
God damn Kuch.

29:17.923 --> 29:19.215
Hey, Otto, it's true!

29:19.424 --> 29:21.717
Old Louden's giving
her the big one!

29:21.927 --> 29:24.638
How? I'm not
lending him my cock.

29:24.846 --> 29:27.223
Lend me your nose.
I'll blow up Montana.

29:27.432 --> 29:28.724
I'll give you something to blow.

29:28.934 --> 29:31.895
First you got to
find it, airhead.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.565
Get down!

29:41.947 --> 29:43.156
Come on, asshole!

29:43.365 --> 29:44.491
You're all talk!

29:44.700 --> 29:45.826
Come on, asshole!

29:46.034 --> 29:47.326
Save it for the opponents!

29:47.536 --> 29:48.662
He is the opponent!

29:48.870 --> 29:50.663
I said save it!

29:50.872 --> 29:53.291
You boys got too much energy.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.835
I want to see you both
before practice.

29:56.044 --> 29:57.837
Now go on, get to homeroom.

29:58.046 --> 30:00.423
All right, let's break it up.

30:06.138 --> 30:08.682
I think this is
a big mistake, man.

30:08.890 --> 30:10.182
Why give yourself nightmares?

30:10.392 --> 30:12.102
I already have nightmares.

30:16.315 --> 30:17.941
It could be worse.

30:21.945 --> 30:23.321
Hey, Shute!

30:23.530 --> 30:24.906
Careful, Louden.

30:29.286 --> 30:31.371
Shut e'.!

30:31.580 --> 30:32.789
Yeah?

30:35.167 --> 30:37.043
Do I know you?

30:37.252 --> 30:39.462
Louden Swain, Thompson high.

30:43.467 --> 30:45.552
Think you'll make the weight?

30:45.761 --> 30:47.053
I don't know.

30:47.262 --> 30:49.305
I hope so.

30:52.017 --> 30:53.810
I hope so, too.

31:12.371 --> 31:13.747
Here, eat this, kid.

31:13.955 --> 31:15.581
You're looking too peaked.

31:15.791 --> 31:17.083
What's in it?

31:17.292 --> 31:18.584
Wheat germ mostly,

31:18.794 --> 31:21.922
with a little bit
of lean ground meat.

31:22.130 --> 31:26.425
I don't want you dropping
dead on my kitchen floor.

31:26.635 --> 31:30.430
I kind of miss old Kevin
since he checked out.

31:30.639 --> 31:32.432
He was really weird, man.

31:32.641 --> 31:34.434
He was weird?

31:34.601 --> 31:36.936
Look at how you're
eating that hamburger.

31:37.145 --> 31:39.939
Pick it up and
eat it like a man.

31:40.148 --> 31:41.440
I can't. I'm in love.

31:41.650 --> 31:43.443
With Kevin? Maybe
he'll come back

31:43.652 --> 31:45.945
and take you away from all this.

31:46.154 --> 31:47.446
I'm in love with Carla.

31:47.656 --> 31:48.948
Listen to it... Carla.

31:49.157 --> 31:50.449
I wanted to ask her

31:50.659 --> 31:52.952
to come down to the
Columbia high match,

31:53.161 --> 31:56.956
watch me kick the shit
out of that guy at 178.

31:57.165 --> 31:59.125
I couldn't find the courage.

31:59.334 --> 32:02.045
I don't have the will
to eat, you know?

32:03.422 --> 32:05.298
What the fuck is this?

32:05.507 --> 32:07.800
You mean you don't recognize it?

32:07.968 --> 32:10.220
Wait a minute. This is cooze.

32:10.429 --> 32:11.972
Yeah. I'm thinking
very seriously

32:12.180 --> 32:14.390
of becoming a gynecologist.

32:14.599 --> 32:17.143
A cooze doctor in outer space?
You're crazy.

32:17.352 --> 32:18.644
I want to look inside women,

32:18.854 --> 32:21.147
find the power that
they have over me.

32:21.314 --> 32:23.899
All I used to think about
was wrestling Shute.

32:24.109 --> 32:25.902
Now all I think about ls...

32:26.111 --> 32:27.821
Carla's cooze.

32:29.114 --> 32:30.907
Well, yeah.

32:55.599 --> 32:56.641
Hello, Carla.

32:56.850 --> 32:58.560
I just was getting a shirt.

33:36.181 --> 33:37.557
Great sounds.

33:37.766 --> 33:40.059
You being sarcastic?

33:40.268 --> 33:44.063
No, no. I like
all kinds of music...

33:44.272 --> 33:47.066
Like, in the background
when I'm thinking

33:47.275 --> 33:49.068
or in a mood or something.

33:49.277 --> 33:50.403
It's Vivaldi.

33:50.612 --> 33:51.612
Yeah, Vivaldi.

33:51.780 --> 33:53.072
He's great.

33:53.281 --> 33:56.075
They give me a discount
where I work.

33:56.284 --> 33:57.910
Oh, yeah. How's
that thing going?

33:58.119 --> 33:59.245
All right.

33:59.454 --> 34:02.081
It's only temporary
till I get going again.

34:02.290 --> 34:03.582
It's a job.

34:03.792 --> 34:05.585
I love the room this way.

34:05.794 --> 34:06.920
You don't mind?

34:07.128 --> 34:09.420
No. This is how
a room ought to look...

34:09.630 --> 34:11.424
So you can tell something

34:11.632 --> 34:13.426
about the person
who sleeps there.

34:13.635 --> 34:15.844
Can I see what you're drawing?

34:22.643 --> 34:24.687
Hey, that's me!

34:25.730 --> 34:27.106
That's really fantastic!

34:27.315 --> 34:29.275
Not just 'cause it's me.

34:29.484 --> 34:31.569
It could be anybody, but...

34:31.777 --> 34:33.571
You're an artist already, Carla.

34:33.780 --> 34:35.697
I'm impressed to hell.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.953
You look very nice.

34:41.161 --> 34:43.121
You got a date?

34:43.331 --> 34:45.791
No. The coach from
Washington state

34:46.001 --> 34:47.293
is here in town.

34:47.502 --> 34:50.379
He's going to meet
us at our school.

34:53.257 --> 34:56.135
You know how to work
one of these things?

34:56.344 --> 34:58.137
I'll give it a shot.

34:58.346 --> 35:00.723
I can't get over that drawing.

35:06.104 --> 35:08.481
Is he going to
offer you a scholarship?

35:08.690 --> 35:09.690
Who?

35:09.858 --> 35:10.858
The coach.

35:11.026 --> 35:13.403
No. He just wants to meet us.

35:14.446 --> 35:15.446
There.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.659
Have a good time, ok?

35:19.826 --> 35:21.410
Ok.

35:23.455 --> 35:24.914

Why am I surprised
to see you here?

36:38.613 --> 36:39.905
I don't know.

36:40.115 --> 36:41.908

Tell you what. Help yourself.

No, I couldn't.

Come on. One rib won't kill you.

Just a couple of guys we met.

38:18.213 --> 38:20.506
They look like
a couple of geeks.

38:20.715 --> 38:23.300
Really? The one
with the mustache

38:23.510 --> 38:26.513
was top rider at
Calgary last year.

38:26.721 --> 38:29.014
Still looks like a geek.

38:29.224 --> 38:32.310

38:36.022 --> 38:38.816
No. I'm going to stick
around a while.

38:39.025 --> 38:43.320
This isn't the kind
of place for an artist.

39:24.779 --> 39:27.156
Thanks for the ride. Good night.

Good luck to you.

39:50.597 --> 39:52.390
with eight straight
pins this year,

39:52.599 --> 39:54.601
our defending state champion
at 168 pounds,

39:54.809 --> 39:56.435
Brian Shute.

39:59.063 --> 40:01.857
Shut e'. Shute! Shut e'.
Shut e'.!

40:03.526 --> 40:05.027

40:06.738 --> 40:08.197
Good luck, son.

Huh?

42:11.029 --> 42:12.155
Louden?

42:18.369 --> 42:21.288
This poem mean
anything to you at all?

42:24.208 --> 42:26.376
Yeah, kind of.

42:27.378 --> 42:31.878
I figure the girl
in the poem's about my age.

42:33.051 --> 42:34.177
She's feeling sad

42:34.385 --> 42:36.512
about the leaves
falling from the trees,

42:36.721 --> 42:40.015
and the poet tells her
what she's really sad about

42:40.224 --> 42:43.518
is that she's beginning to
realize she'll die someday, too.

42:43.728 --> 42:45.855
The thing is,
she's already dying.

42:48.399 --> 42:51.276
Is that a good thing to realize,

42:51.486 --> 42:55.615
or would we be better off
not thinking about it?

42:55.823 --> 42:57.115
I don't know.

42:57.325 --> 42:59.952
Nobody likes to think about it.

43:00.161 --> 43:02.788
I don't like to think about it.

43:02.997 --> 43:04.289
But if you don't,

43:04.499 --> 43:05.791
you might go through life

43:06.000 --> 43:08.293
thinking you've got
plenty of time.

43:08.503 --> 43:11.297
You put off the really
important stuff until later,

43:11.506 --> 43:14.800
and before you know it,
there's no more time left,

43:15.009 --> 43:16.719
and you've blown it.

43:17.929 --> 43:19.805
That's not bad, Louden.

43:20.014 --> 43:21.306
Not bad at all.

43:24.018 --> 43:26.145
Oh, by the way,
papers, everybody.

43:26.354 --> 43:28.230
I want to see them tomorrow.

43:41.285 --> 43:42.619
Hey, Swain.

43:42.829 --> 43:45.122
Ok, I'll give it
to you straight.

43:45.331 --> 43:47.374
I think I love you.

43:50.253 --> 43:52.088
Oh, Jesus.

43:53.297 --> 43:54.423
Drink this.

43:56.634 --> 43:58.010
I think you're dehydrated.

43:58.219 --> 43:59.511
Naw, I'm the victim

43:59.720 --> 44:01.513
of a screwed-up
nitrogen balance.

44:01.722 --> 44:04.349
Plus I think I've
contracted priapism.

44:04.559 --> 44:06.352
It might be pathological.

44:06.561 --> 44:09.438
Priapism? What's priapism?

44:09.647 --> 44:10.939
The disease
of constant erection.

44:11.149 --> 44:13.609
I read about it in
my rare diseases book.

44:13.818 --> 44:15.110
Believe me, it's not funny.

44:15.319 --> 44:18.613
The girl of my dreams
lives under my own roof.

44:18.823 --> 44:20.115
I see her every day,

44:20.324 --> 44:23.618
but she thinks I'm a kid,
immature, a dumb jock...

44:23.828 --> 44:26.622
All of which is
more or less true.

44:26.831 --> 44:28.123
I'm dying, Mr. Tanneran,

44:28.332 --> 44:30.625
like that girl in the poem,

44:30.835 --> 44:33.796
only quicker and with a hard-on.

44:36.299 --> 44:37.425
Carla?

44:44.807 --> 44:46.683
Mr. Tanneran, she's wonderful.

44:46.893 --> 44:49.395
She's got all the best
things I like in girls

44:49.604 --> 44:52.648
and all the best things
I like in guys.

44:57.612 --> 44:58.904
Excellent!

44:59.113 --> 45:03.075
Number-one man, arm on elbows.
Fireman. Ready?

45:06.495 --> 45:07.537
Excellent!

45:07.747 --> 45:09.623
That's the way to finish it.

45:13.127 --> 45:15.754
May I help you, young lady?

45:15.963 --> 45:18.423
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

45:18.633 --> 45:20.426
Louden, is that her?

45:20.635 --> 45:22.428
Why are you wasting your time

45:22.637 --> 45:23.929
with a faggot like Louden?

45:24.138 --> 45:26.765
Hey, come out here in the hall.

45:26.974 --> 45:29.226
This place is the pits.

45:29.435 --> 45:32.229
The smell in there
isn't even human.

45:32.438 --> 45:33.564
You ok?

45:33.773 --> 45:34.940
Yeah. Why?

45:35.149 --> 45:36.942
I heard you fainted.

45:37.151 --> 45:39.945
Oh. I had kind of a temporary
nitrogen imbalance,

45:40.154 --> 45:41.947
kind of a sodium
depletion syndrome,

45:42.156 --> 45:43.615
maybe some general
light-headedness,

45:43.783 --> 45:45.451
maybe one or two other things.

45:45.660 --> 45:47.036
Will you live, or what?

45:51.332 --> 45:53.709
I'm just trying
to cut weight, you know,

45:53.918 --> 45:55.711
trying to get down to 168.

45:55.920 --> 45:57.046
I don't get it.

45:57.255 --> 45:59.048
Why do you want to get smaller

45:59.257 --> 46:00.549
and wrestle a small guy?

46:00.758 --> 46:03.552
Why not get bigger and
wrestle a big guy?

46:03.761 --> 46:05.304
Big guys aren't better.

46:05.513 --> 46:08.307
168 happens to be the toughest
division in the state,

46:08.516 --> 46:10.643
maybe in the whole
god damn world.

46:10.851 --> 46:13.144
I don't want to see
you starve yourself.

46:13.354 --> 46:15.481
You're kind of like
a stepbrother.

46:15.690 --> 46:17.775
What do you mean, stepbrother?

46:17.984 --> 46:19.819
What would you call it?

46:20.027 --> 46:23.822
Well, I don't know if I'd
call it a stepbrother.

46:24.031 --> 46:26.825
I don't know how a
stepbrother supposed to feel.

46:27.034 --> 46:28.326
Take care of yourself, ok?

46:28.536 --> 46:30.829
Louden, I want to
see you in my office.

46:31.038 --> 46:32.330
All right.

46:35.918 --> 46:38.295
I do take care of myself.

46:38.504 --> 46:40.923
I'll see you later... At home.

46:50.641 --> 46:52.434
Stepbrother.

47:00.484 --> 47:01.526
No good.

47:01.736 --> 47:03.362
You're at 6% body fat.

47:03.571 --> 47:07.866
Fellas told me you took a
nose dive in the hallway.

47:08.075 --> 47:10.869
I feel fine, coach. Honest.
It was nothing.

47:11.078 --> 47:14.372
Now, I remember the first
time you walked in here

47:14.582 --> 47:16.875
and asked me to let you wrestle.

47:17.084 --> 47:19.377
You still had hay in your hair.

47:19.587 --> 47:21.880
What a surprise
you turned out to be,

47:22.089 --> 47:24.382
darn near going the
distance your first year.

47:24.592 --> 47:25.884
Well, this is your year.

47:26.093 --> 47:28.553
You can be a state
champion this year,

47:28.763 --> 47:31.390
but not at 168.
It's not in the cards.

47:31.599 --> 47:33.892
I don't care about
a state championship.

47:34.101 --> 47:35.894
I just want to wrestle Shute.

47:36.103 --> 47:37.103
Fuck Shute!

47:37.229 --> 47:38.939
Pardon my language.

47:40.191 --> 47:41.567
Three years, undefeated.

47:41.776 --> 47:43.068
Nobody's even come close.

47:43.277 --> 47:45.570
I saw him take
MaClean for a fall

47:45.780 --> 47:47.990
without even working up a sweat.

47:49.700 --> 47:51.576
I didn't want to bring this up,

47:51.786 --> 47:54.079
but if you're looking for
a wrestling scholarship,

47:54.288 --> 47:56.081
this isn't the way to do it.

47:56.290 --> 47:58.417
I'm kind of committed to this.

47:58.626 --> 47:59.918
Well, it's not your decision.

48:00.127 --> 48:02.587
It's mine, and the answer is no.

48:02.797 --> 48:03.589
No?

48:03.798 --> 48:04.798
That's right.

48:04.924 --> 48:06.592
I won't watch you ruin yourself

48:06.801 --> 48:08.093
and bring down this team

48:08.302 --> 48:10.095
for some silly dream of glory.

48:10.304 --> 48:11.596
Now go back to practice.

48:11.806 --> 48:14.433
Make plans to wrestle
at your weight

48:14.642 --> 48:16.018
or not at all.

48:31.742 --> 48:33.952
Hey, dude, we're
sweating ass in here.

48:34.161 --> 48:35.453
Where you been?

48:35.621 --> 48:38.290
If you're on some ego trip,
that's your problem.

48:38.499 --> 48:39.791
You're not a team player.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.127
I got a bulletin for you, Otto...

48:42.336 --> 48:44.129
Wrestling is not a team sport.

48:44.338 --> 48:46.631
When you're fighting
someone faster than you,

48:46.841 --> 48:49.718
there's not much a
team can do for you.

48:58.769 --> 49:01.646
Come on, Louden, you're
never going to make it.

49:01.856 --> 49:03.148
Even Otto can't do that.

I'm working on my article.

51:07.106 --> 51:09.233
What part of the body?

51:09.441 --> 51:10.442
Clitoris.

51:10.651 --> 51:13.111
That's kind of a female
thing, isn't it?

51:13.320 --> 51:15.697
Yeah, but it's homologous
with the male penis.

51:15.906 --> 51:18.783
Are you sure
that's a proper subject

51:18.993 --> 51:20.911
for a school paper?

51:21.120 --> 51:23.205
Pop, this is the 20th century.

51:33.215 --> 51:34.591
I'm speechless.

51:34.800 --> 51:36.593
You've broken
new ground here, Louden.

51:36.802 --> 51:38.595
This is professional stuff.

51:38.804 --> 51:41.598
We are going to drag
this dinky school paper

51:41.807 --> 51:43.809
right into the 20th century.

51:44.018 --> 51:45.602
Where do you get your ideas?

51:45.811 --> 51:48.605
I've been thinking a lot
about that stuff lately.

51:48.814 --> 51:50.982
Oh! We're going to
make history here!

51:51.191 --> 51:54.319
What a blast to
the first amendment.

51:54.528 --> 51:57.322
First, they shut down the press

51:57.531 --> 52:00.158
and imprison the intellectuals.

52:00.367 --> 52:02.660
I loved your piece
on the clitoris.

52:02.870 --> 52:05.664
I showed it to my mother!

52:05.873 --> 52:07.165
Hey, Elmo.

52:07.374 --> 52:09.334
Yeah?

52:09.543 --> 52:12.462
What do you know
about the clitoris?

52:12.671 --> 52:14.839
Well, I don't know what
it looks like exactly,

52:15.049 --> 52:18.844
but I kind of know
where it's at... Sort of.

52:19.053 --> 52:22.347
It's an incredible piece
of equipment, considering.

52:22.514 --> 52:23.932
1...

52:24.975 --> 52:26.434
2...

52:27.478 --> 52:28.937
3-

52:39.156 --> 52:42.534
You think if I
called up Shute...

52:42.743 --> 52:44.035
Tonight,

52:44.203 --> 52:46.538
he'd come down to the hotel

52:46.747 --> 52:50.542
and wrestle me in one
of the banquet rooms?

52:50.751 --> 52:55.046
I don't know if I can
hack it much longer.

52:55.255 --> 52:57.799
You could just forget it.

52:59.009 --> 53:00.385
You don't have to wrestle him.

53:00.594 --> 53:02.637
It ain't written anywhere.

53:26.036 --> 53:28.413
It's my iron. I'm low on iron.

53:28.622 --> 53:30.415
Has this ever happened before?

53:30.624 --> 53:31.750
No, never.

53:31.959 --> 53:33.251
Do me a favor.

53:33.460 --> 53:36.212
Walk home tonight
like a normal person.

53:36.422 --> 53:37.756
I need this now, man.

53:37.965 --> 53:40.258
First, I faint. Now I
can't hold my blood.

53:40.467 --> 53:41.759
You going to tell coach?

53:41.969 --> 53:43.929
No. If you tell him,
I swear I'll kill you.

53:44.138 --> 53:45.430
I wouldn't tell him.

53:45.639 --> 53:48.767
You think I'd tell him
something like that?

53:48.976 --> 53:50.852
I don't tell him nothing.

54:04.575 --> 54:07.536
I don't say nothing
to no one, man.

What do you care
whether I do or not?

55:35.207 --> 55:38.376
Wait a minute. I think I
missed something somewhere.

55:38.585 --> 55:40.378
I heard you fainted in school.

55:40.587 --> 55:42.380
I was worried about you.

55:42.589 --> 55:44.048
We had a nice conversation,

55:44.258 --> 55:46.551
and you act like
I'm an intrusion.

55:46.760 --> 55:48.052
You heard I fainted?

55:48.262 --> 55:49.554
Tanneran told you.

55:49.763 --> 55:52.223
He told you everything I said.

55:52.432 --> 55:54.517
We talked about you.

55:54.726 --> 55:56.018
He says you're very sensitive.

55:56.228 --> 55:57.562
I don't see that in you.

55:57.771 --> 56:00.398
Unless you want to see more
than you bargained for,

56:00.607 --> 56:01.733
you better beat it.

56:01.942 --> 56:03.902
I've seen naked men before.

56:04.111 --> 56:06.404
Yeah, I bet you have.

56:06.613 --> 56:08.156
Would you stop
playing this number?

56:08.365 --> 56:09.657
Just because I'm staying here...

56:09.867 --> 56:11.159
You want me to go?

56:11.368 --> 56:12.577
Do what you want!

56:12.786 --> 56:14.579
What do you want from me?

56:14.788 --> 56:17.248
You're fucking Tanneran!
Why don't you fuck me?

56:17.457 --> 56:20.084
Aah! Son of a bitch!

56:20.294 --> 56:22.921
Don't you ever try that again!

56:23.130 --> 56:25.924
I choose who
I'm going to be with

56:26.133 --> 56:28.593
and what I'm going to do.

56:28.802 --> 56:30.929
I'll never be with
any foulmouthed kid jock

56:31.138 --> 56:34.099
who thinks a stiff cock
is the height of romance.

56:34.308 --> 56:36.435
Part of being a man, asshole,

56:36.643 --> 56:38.561
is knowing what a woman wants

56:38.770 --> 56:39.896
and respecting that.

56:40.105 --> 56:41.397
Part of being a kid

56:41.607 --> 56:43.942
is you could say
something really stupid

56:44.151 --> 56:47.362
and still not get your faced
ripped off for saying it.

56:51.074 --> 56:52.742
How's your nose?

56:52.951 --> 56:55.870
It's all right.
I'm just low on iron.

56:56.079 --> 56:59.457
Yeah, you ought to
eat more spinach.

56:59.666 --> 57:01.542
I'm sorry, ok?

57:10.385 --> 57:12.261
You're a shitty-ass baby!

57:12.471 --> 57:14.764
Whatever you say, dad.

57:14.973 --> 57:17.308
You think that you're hot shit!

57:17.517 --> 57:20.436
You think that you
can wrestle, don't you?

57:20.646 --> 57:21.938
But you can't wrestle!

57:22.147 --> 57:23.606
Whatever you say, dad.

57:23.815 --> 57:26.609
You can't do anything
because you're a bum.

57:26.818 --> 57:28.319
Whatever you say, dad.

57:28.528 --> 57:32.323
You ain't got the balls
to fight an old man?

57:32.532 --> 57:34.825
You ain't got the balls
to fight an old man?

57:35.035 --> 57:37.328
You're just like
your god damn mother!

57:37.537 --> 57:39.413
You god damn punk!

57:47.756 --> 57:51.134
My old lady's already
in a place fur drunks.

57:51.343 --> 57:53.970
They either dry her
out, or she dies.

57:54.179 --> 57:55.513
My, uh, my ma,

57:55.722 --> 57:58.474
she ran off with
a guy who sells glassware...

57:58.684 --> 58:00.477
Bowls, pitchers,
candleholders and shit.

58:00.686 --> 58:01.770
Terrific, huh?

58:01.979 --> 58:05.440
I figure all this is
just the first period.

58:05.649 --> 58:07.692
Pretty soon we'll be
in control of our lives.

58:07.859 --> 58:09.193
What lives, man?

58:09.403 --> 58:11.696
This is my last
wrestling season.

58:11.905 --> 58:13.698
I'll be in the fucking Navy

58:13.907 --> 58:15.033
this time next year.

58:15.242 --> 58:16.368
Come on, Kuch, man.

58:16.576 --> 58:18.869
You're going to be
the first Indian president.

58:19.079 --> 58:20.371
Sure, except for one thing...

58:20.580 --> 58:21.872
I ain't no fucking Indian.

58:22.082 --> 58:24.084
It's just shit I made up.

58:28.630 --> 58:31.090
A lot of people
ain't Indians, Kuch.

58:32.467 --> 58:33.843
Come on, man. Stop crying.

58:34.052 --> 58:35.845
I'm lousy with people who cry.

58:36.054 --> 58:37.054
Who's crying?

58:37.222 --> 58:39.432
Fuck you if you
think I'm crying!

58:48.150 --> 58:50.527
Come on, you guys! You're late!

58:50.736 --> 58:53.029
You think the
everywhere spirit cares

58:53.238 --> 58:54.364
if you're an Indian?

58:54.573 --> 58:56.700
He talks to who he wants to.

It's no biggie, man.

59:22.684 --> 59:27.184
Once... Carla caught me
with my nose in her panties.

59:28.273 --> 59:30.066
She woke up, huh?

59:30.275 --> 59:33.653
They weren't on her
at the time, shitface.

59:35.697 --> 59:39.575
If you get on the mat
with the monster at 168,

59:39.785 --> 59:41.161
we'll call it even.

59:43.705 --> 59:45.581
It's no problem, man.

59:45.791 --> 59:48.877
It's, like, in the stars.

59:50.420 --> 59:51.754
Last year's district champions.

59:51.963 --> 59:55.299
Would you please welcome
the Columbia bulldogs?

01:00:15.237 --> 01:00:17.280
And from the city of Spokane,

01:00:17.489 --> 01:00:20.992
placed third in last year's
state championships,

01:00:21.201 --> 01:00:23.536
the Thompson
high school warriors.

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:32.003
No prisoners!

01:00:32.212 --> 01:00:34.005
No prisoners!

01:00:47.435 --> 01:00:49.228
2, take-down, green.

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:53.608
2, take-down, green.

01:00:55.944 --> 01:00:58.404
Green. Near fall, green.

01:00:59.447 --> 01:01:00.823
And green.

01:01:01.032 --> 01:01:02.408
Near fall, green.

01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:18.466
Come on, Schmoozler!

01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:24.347
Fall!

01:01:24.556 --> 01:01:25.723
Yeah!

01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:30.144
Foley wins by a pin.

01:01:51.499 --> 01:01:52.875
Now wrestling

01:01:53.084 --> 01:01:56.420
for Columbia high school
at 178 pounds,

01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:58.131
Louis Smith.

01:02:01.218 --> 01:02:04.262
For visiting
Thompson high school

01:02:04.471 --> 01:02:06.264
at 178 pounds,

01:02:06.473 --> 01:02:08.016
Louden Swain.

01:02:11.228 --> 01:02:12.520
Shake hands, gentlemen.

01:02:12.729 --> 01:02:13.938
Nice hair, man.

01:02:14.147 --> 01:02:15.314
Real cute, Swain.

01:02:19.903 --> 01:02:22.447
This isn't a street fight.

01:02:22.656 --> 01:02:24.449
This is a wrestling match.

01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:25.950
No more unnecessary roughness.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.292
Drive him down!

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:42.258
2, take-down. 2, red.

01:02:42.467 --> 01:02:45.094
2 points for a take-down

01:02:45.303 --> 01:02:46.804
for Louden Swain.

01:02:52.394 --> 01:02:55.647
1 point, escape,
for Louis Smith.

01:03:05.282 --> 01:03:07.575
Out. 2, take-down, red.

01:03:07.784 --> 01:03:09.118
2!

01:03:09.327 --> 01:03:11.954
2 points for a take-down
for Louden Swain.

01:03:12.163 --> 01:03:13.330
Louden! Louden!

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:14.999
Go, hey, go!

01:03:17.544 --> 01:03:21.506
BOO! BOO! BOO! BOO!

01:03:21.715 --> 01:03:23.758
Caution, green. False start.

01:03:25.218 --> 01:03:27.178
Take your positions.

01:03:27.387 --> 01:03:30.681
Caution on Louis Smith
for false start.

01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:33.684
Hold it, hold it.
My time. My time!

01:03:33.893 --> 01:03:35.477
Ok, let's take a look.

01:03:35.687 --> 01:03:36.979
Coach!

01:03:37.188 --> 01:03:40.107
A medical time-out called
for Louden Swain.

01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:46.781
Got punched?

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:49.283
No. He didn't even hit me.

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:51.785
You don't want to sit this out?

01:03:51.995 --> 01:03:53.705
No way. I'm killing him.

01:03:53.913 --> 01:03:55.205
He's all right.

01:03:55.415 --> 01:03:56.958
Get him, Louden!

01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:14.851
1, green! 1, green!

01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:16.644
No!

01:04:22.275 --> 01:04:23.985
All right!

01:04:24.194 --> 01:04:25.820
2, take-down, red. 2.

01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:27.822
2 points, take-down, Swain.

01:04:29.199 --> 01:04:31.326
Hold it! Hold it, hold it!

01:04:31.534 --> 01:04:33.911
Hold it right here. Coach!

01:04:38.958 --> 01:04:40.834
You'll have to give this one up.

01:04:41.044 --> 01:04:42.920
What? I'm way ahead of him!

01:04:43.129 --> 01:04:44.129
Hey!

01:04:44.297 --> 01:04:45.506
It's over!

01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:47.508
BOO! BOO!

01:04:47.717 --> 01:04:49.844
Get off! It's over!

01:04:50.053 --> 01:04:52.847
Medical default by Louden Swain

01:04:53.056 --> 01:04:54.932
gives Louis Smith the win.

01:05:19.749 --> 01:05:21.125
You didn't win nothing!

01:05:21.334 --> 01:05:22.960
Come on! Right now, assholes!

01:05:23.169 --> 01:05:25.546
I'll wrestle you right now!

01:05:25.755 --> 01:05:27.131
Good match, Dewey.

01:05:40.019 --> 01:05:41.395
You got a problem, man.

01:05:41.604 --> 01:05:43.897
I got a lot of
problems. So what?

01:05:44.107 --> 01:05:45.399
You can't hold your mud.

01:05:45.608 --> 01:05:46.900
You're a bleeder,

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:49.403
and I like to see blood.

01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:50.904
Yeah? How about your own?

01:05:51.114 --> 01:05:53.407
60 seconds on the mat,
you're dog meat.

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:55.326
Forget the mat. I'm ready.

01:05:55.535 --> 01:05:56.327
Louden.

01:05:56.536 --> 01:05:58.287
You'll never be ready for me.

01:05:58.496 --> 01:05:59.788
I'm ready for you now.

01:05:59.998 --> 01:06:01.290
What's holding you back?

01:06:01.499 --> 01:06:03.459
Come on, you guys. Knock it off.

01:06:03.668 --> 01:06:06.003
I'm going to let you
sweat it, wimp.

01:06:12.385 --> 01:06:13.761
Who the hell is that?

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:14.970
Shute.

01:06:15.138 --> 01:06:17.431
He's trying to psych me out.

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:20.434
Yeah, I see what you mean.

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:23.020
I didn't expect to see you here.

01:06:23.229 --> 01:06:25.522
Well, your dad
finally fixed up my car.

01:06:25.732 --> 01:06:27.525
I'll give you a lift home,

01:06:27.734 --> 01:06:30.027
unless you'd rather go
on the bus.

01:06:30.236 --> 01:06:32.529
I think you've got
this Shute guy worried.

01:06:32.739 --> 01:06:34.532
Why else would he be here?

01:06:34.741 --> 01:06:37.118
He's the one who's
sweating it out.

01:06:47.837 --> 01:06:49.213
Aren't you starving?

01:06:49.422 --> 01:06:52.299
Yeah, but I'm used to it by now.

01:06:52.509 --> 01:06:55.303
First time I've ever went
to a wrestling match.

01:06:55.512 --> 01:06:56.804
It wasn't what I expected.

01:06:57.013 --> 01:06:59.807
I guess I expected
some macho violence trip,

01:07:00.016 --> 01:07:02.977
but it was all right, you know?

01:07:03.186 --> 01:07:05.062
Guess I just didn't understand.

01:07:10.610 --> 01:07:11.986
Do you have to go?

01:07:12.195 --> 01:07:14.363
You can be an artist anyplace,

01:07:14.572 --> 01:07:15.864
even here.

01:07:16.074 --> 01:07:17.533
I don't like to think

01:07:17.742 --> 01:07:19.618
about you being someplace else.

01:07:20.828 --> 01:07:22.412
Louden...

01:07:22.622 --> 01:07:26.000
Your dad says you're going to
get a wrestling scholarship.

01:07:26.209 --> 01:07:28.419
He says you've got
a good future.

01:07:28.628 --> 01:07:31.839
That's the first time you
ever called me Louden.

01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:36.176
I want you to know something.

01:07:36.386 --> 01:07:39.180
I don't care if you're
making it with Tanneran.

01:07:39.389 --> 01:07:40.681
It's none of my business.

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:43.934
Tanneran's a great guy,
to tell the truth.

01:07:44.143 --> 01:07:46.019
He could've played
pro basketball.

01:07:46.229 --> 01:07:47.563
If I was a girl,

01:07:47.772 --> 01:07:51.025
I'd probably be making it
for a guy like Tanneran.

01:07:51.234 --> 01:07:53.110
I'm crazy about the guy myself,

01:07:53.319 --> 01:07:54.945
in a normal sort of way.

01:07:55.113 --> 01:07:56.280
You nearly finished?

01:07:56.489 --> 01:07:57.489
Yeah. Why?

01:08:40.366 --> 01:08:42.242
Don't dog it, man.

01:08:42.452 --> 01:08:45.246
Shute does 200 of these things

01:08:45.455 --> 01:08:48.916
with his old man on his back.

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:51.502
Ever see Shute's old man?

01:08:56.215 --> 01:08:57.256
174.

01:08:57.466 --> 01:08:59.260
How are you feeling?

01:08:59.469 --> 01:09:00.761
I feel fine.

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:02.136
Honest.

01:09:02.346 --> 01:09:04.557
It'll happen. It's
bigger than both of us.

01:09:13.066 --> 01:09:14.692
Some detergent.

01:09:17.737 --> 01:09:18.863
Watch.

01:09:21.573 --> 01:09:22.866
Paying attention?

01:09:25.745 --> 01:09:26.787
Ta-da!

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:28.287
Aw.

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:29.540
Shit.

01:09:30.667 --> 01:09:31.667
Shit.

01:09:31.751 --> 01:09:32.960
Oh, god.

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:34.879
Put your head back.

01:09:40.593 --> 01:09:42.970
I think it's stopped now.

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:46.015
I've turned into a real bleeder.

01:09:46.224 --> 01:09:48.975
You've just been
training too hard.

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:52.062
Look at your clothes.
They're hanging off you.

01:09:52.270 --> 01:09:55.148
I want you to take
this weekend off.

01:09:55.358 --> 01:09:56.650
Go visit your grandpa.

01:09:56.859 --> 01:09:58.652
I've been worried
about him anyway.

01:09:58.861 --> 01:10:00.654
I'd love to see him,

01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:02.865
but I can't
start sloughing off now.

01:10:03.074 --> 01:10:04.366
The match is Tuesday,

01:10:04.575 --> 01:10:06.868
and I still got
2 1/2 pounds to go.

01:10:07.078 --> 01:10:08.204
Where's grandpa?

01:10:08.413 --> 01:10:10.706
He's got a little
place in the woods.

01:10:10.915 --> 01:10:12.333
He hasn't been feeling well.

01:10:12.542 --> 01:10:16.170
I'd go myself, but I've
got a job interview.

01:10:16.379 --> 01:10:17.838
I'll go with you.

01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:20.841
I get a kick out of old people.

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:25.179
Well... I could work out
a little up there,

01:10:25.388 --> 01:10:27.264
and then there's always Monday.

01:10:44.657 --> 01:10:46.116
This is my...

01:10:48.077 --> 01:10:49.536
Traveling music tape.

01:10:49.746 --> 01:10:51.372
I listen to it

01:10:51.581 --> 01:10:54.375
and pretend I'm rolling
through a strange town

01:10:54.584 --> 01:10:56.961
on some terrific
rendezvous with destiny.

01:10:58.337 --> 01:10:59.880
You want some tea?

01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:01.381
You come prepared.

01:11:01.591 --> 01:11:03.384
I'm just waiting for the day

01:11:03.593 --> 01:11:05.386
some millionaire
will get a flat.

01:11:05.595 --> 01:11:07.888
I'll change his tire
and pour him tea.

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:09.890
He'll pay my way
through college.

01:11:10.099 --> 01:11:11.892
He'll hit you on the head,

01:11:12.101 --> 01:11:13.393
and you'll wake up

01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:16.897
with an asshole the size
of the Lincoln tunnel.

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:18.899
God.

01:11:19.108 --> 01:11:20.400
What a realist.

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:22.153
I'm depressed.

You know, there's a nice thing

01:12:13.162 --> 01:12:14.955
about working out all the time.

01:12:15.164 --> 01:12:17.708
You have a lot of
nocturnal emissions.

01:12:17.917 --> 01:12:19.710
You mean like wet dreams?

01:12:19.919 --> 01:12:23.047
It's a great way to wake up.

01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:27.175
I always have this one dream,

01:12:27.385 --> 01:12:28.969
and there's this girl...

01:12:29.178 --> 01:12:30.220
What girl?

01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:34.558
I don't know.

01:12:34.767 --> 01:12:35.893
Just some girl.

01:12:36.102 --> 01:12:39.647
This your idea of turning me on?

01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:41.816
No, of course not.

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:46.486
Is it turning you on?

01:12:46.696 --> 01:12:47.738
Maybe.

01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:50.491
Really?

01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:51.992
Maybe not.

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:54.995
Want to know what turns me on?

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:56.914
If you don't mind.

01:12:57.081 --> 01:12:58.082
Hands.

01:12:58.291 --> 01:12:59.583
Really big hands,

01:12:59.792 --> 01:13:02.586
the kind that
when they hold you,

01:13:02.795 --> 01:13:04.505
you really feel held,

01:13:04.714 --> 01:13:07.591
like nothing
can sneak up on you.

01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:14.765
There's a gas station up ahead.

01:13:14.974 --> 01:13:16.183
Right there?

01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:31.615
You still cold?

01:13:31.824 --> 01:13:33.408
Mm-mmm.

01:13:33.618 --> 01:13:35.202
It's beautiful here.

01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:38.038
Yeah, it is.

01:13:42.752 --> 01:13:45.629
Carla, if I tell you
something about myself,

01:13:45.838 --> 01:13:48.131
will you promise not to laugh?

01:13:48.341 --> 01:13:51.385
It might help explain
something about myself.

01:13:51.594 --> 01:13:52.594
Ok.

01:13:52.678 --> 01:13:55.013
Then again, it might not.

01:13:57.058 --> 01:13:58.642
I'm still a virgin.

01:13:58.851 --> 01:14:02.646
I could've done it when
I was in eighth grade.

01:14:02.855 --> 01:14:05.148
Five of us were in
this guy's basement,

01:14:05.358 --> 01:14:06.942
taking turns on his sister,

01:14:07.151 --> 01:14:09.653
who was crazy about
the idea, by the way.

01:14:09.862 --> 01:14:12.239
Her name was Mary Ann.

01:14:13.282 --> 01:14:15.158
I don't know, I...

01:14:15.368 --> 01:14:16.660
I couldn't do it.

01:14:16.869 --> 01:14:18.829
I felt sorry for her.

01:14:19.038 --> 01:14:20.831
I was also scared to death,

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.417
if you got to know the truth.

01:14:27.088 --> 01:14:29.965
I don't know why it's
so embarrassing for me.

01:14:30.174 --> 01:14:32.968
Is it so terrible
for a guy my age

01:14:33.177 --> 01:14:34.595
to still be a virgin?

01:14:34.804 --> 01:14:37.097
Does it make him
a queer or what?

01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:39.599
Of course it doesn't
make you a queer.

01:14:39.809 --> 01:14:41.477
It doesn't make you anything

01:14:41.686 --> 01:14:43.688
except what you are already,

01:14:43.896 --> 01:14:46.940
which isn't half bad,
if you want my opinion.

01:14:49.318 --> 01:14:50.986
Thank you.

01:14:51.195 --> 01:14:52.487
I appreciate that.

01:14:52.697 --> 01:14:54.490
Did you know that
sexual intercourse

01:14:54.699 --> 01:14:57.993
burns up 200 calories
a shot, by the way?

01:14:58.202 --> 01:15:01.288
That's one way to look at it.

01:15:23.644 --> 01:15:25.520
I want to tell you something

01:15:25.730 --> 01:15:28.524
even if it is none
of your damn business.

01:15:28.733 --> 01:15:30.025
I never fucked Tanneran.

01:15:30.234 --> 01:15:32.527
We just like
each other's company.

01:15:32.737 --> 01:15:34.530
I make him laugh.

01:15:34.739 --> 01:15:36.031
He makes me think.

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:37.532
We're like friends...

01:15:37.742 --> 01:15:39.118
Kind to each other.

01:15:42.538 --> 01:15:43.747
Well?

01:15:43.914 --> 01:15:46.249
Nothing. I just find
it hard to believe.

01:15:46.459 --> 01:15:48.752
Yeah, well, that's
what makes you a kid,

01:15:48.961 --> 01:15:51.213
not that you've never been laid.

01:15:51.422 --> 01:15:53.090
Getting laid counts for nothing.

01:15:53.299 --> 01:15:55.092
Sure, if you're a girl.

01:15:55.301 --> 01:15:56.593
If you're a boy,

01:15:56.802 --> 01:15:58.678
it counts for just
about everything.

01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:03.016
Good night, Louden.

01:16:10.191 --> 01:16:11.650
Good night, Carla.

01:16:20.868 --> 01:16:22.327
There's my grandpa.

01:16:30.711 --> 01:16:33.588
They give me these things
at the vets'.

01:16:33.798 --> 01:16:36.091
Spoils of trench warfare.

01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:38.760
They don't seem to
slow you down much.

01:16:38.969 --> 01:16:40.261
Oh, hell, no.

01:16:40.471 --> 01:16:43.599
I can hunt, fish, hike
in the god damn mountains,

01:16:43.808 --> 01:16:45.142
I just take these along.

01:16:45.351 --> 01:16:48.645
Might even feel like
doing some wrestling.

01:16:48.854 --> 01:16:51.147
Find yourself some Indian
woman to wrestle with.

01:16:51.357 --> 01:16:53.567
All's you do is beat me up.

01:16:54.777 --> 01:16:57.821
This is my year to be a hero.

01:16:58.030 --> 01:17:01.408
Pop wants you to live
with us in Spokane.

01:17:01.617 --> 01:17:04.328
Tell your dad
thanks for the offer.

01:17:04.537 --> 01:17:05.829
I told him you wouldn't.

01:17:06.038 --> 01:17:07.164
City's all right

01:17:07.373 --> 01:17:09.500
if you need what it's got there.

01:17:09.708 --> 01:17:11.126
I got everything
I need right he...

01:17:12.336 --> 01:17:15.172
Got my guns, my fishing poles,

01:17:15.381 --> 01:17:16.924
these medihalers to suck on.

01:17:18.634 --> 01:17:22.179
Grandpa, I'm glad I
get your blood in me.

01:17:22.346 --> 01:17:25.557
Don't let it go to your head.

01:17:37.987 --> 01:17:39.863
Your grandpa's a great old guy.

01:17:40.072 --> 01:17:43.867
Bet he was a real animal
when he was younger.

01:17:44.076 --> 01:17:46.953
Pop always says
I take after him.

01:17:48.998 --> 01:17:50.874
I'm going to miss him.

01:17:51.083 --> 01:17:52.876
I'm going to miss everything.

01:17:53.085 --> 01:17:54.878
I already do.

01:17:55.087 --> 01:17:56.880
You have a lifetime left.

01:17:57.089 --> 01:17:59.883
Why waste it missing
what's already gone?

01:18:00.092 --> 01:18:01.885
Does seem morbid, doesn't it?

01:18:02.094 --> 01:18:03.887
I can't help it, though.

01:18:04.096 --> 01:18:06.890
Somebody ought to put me away.

01:18:07.099 --> 01:18:10.894
Just think of all the wonderful
world you haven't seen yet.

01:18:11.103 --> 01:18:14.397
How can I think about
it if I haven't seen it?

01:18:14.607 --> 01:18:16.984
What about wrestling,
college, and stuff?

01:18:18.027 --> 01:18:19.820
What about vision quests...

01:18:23.532 --> 01:18:25.909
And all the girls
you'll make love with?

01:18:26.118 --> 01:18:27.160

I can't remember why
I started all that.

Think. Maybe it'll

01:19:19.797 --> 01:19:21.089
I must've been crazy,

01:19:21.298 --> 01:19:22.674
temporarily insane or something.

Anything. You know that.

01:20:56.393 --> 01:20:57.685
Make the weight.

01:20:57.895 --> 01:21:01.732
Get on the mat
with this Shute guy.

01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:04.692
See it through the way
you always planned to.

01:21:04.902 --> 01:21:07.779
Is that all you want from me?

01:21:14.995 --> 01:21:16.871
Ok, for tomorrow,
read Emerson's essays

01:21:17.081 --> 01:21:19.416
on self-reliance
and the over-soul.

01:21:19.625 --> 01:21:21.918
I want to know
how these ideas apply

01:21:22.127 --> 01:21:23.419
to modern-day Spokane

01:21:23.629 --> 01:21:26.423
and the people who
spend their days here.

01:21:26.632 --> 01:21:27.674
Thank you.

01:21:35.349 --> 01:21:36.725
Mr. Tanneran.

01:21:36.934 --> 01:21:38.310
Hey, Louden.

01:21:39.853 --> 01:21:41.229
Thank you.

01:21:41.438 --> 01:21:42.814
For what?

01:21:44.358 --> 01:21:46.735
For being a terrific teacher.

01:21:46.944 --> 01:21:48.779
Hey, what can I say?

01:21:50.364 --> 01:21:53.241
And not sticking it to Carla

01:21:53.450 --> 01:21:55.743

01:21:55.953 --> 01:21:58.956
See, I just want everybody
to know how I feel,

01:21:59.164 --> 01:22:00.748
in case tomorrow night

01:22:00.958 --> 01:22:04.044
I end up getting mangled and
paralyzed from my eyeballs down.

01:22:06.213 --> 01:22:07.589
You know something, Louden?

01:22:07.798 --> 01:22:09.090
For the first time,

01:22:09.299 --> 01:22:12.552
I'm starting to worry
about that other guy.

01:22:19.476 --> 01:22:21.686
Ok, fellas let's circle it up.

01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:28.359
Ready.

I don't know, coach.

01:25:16.653 --> 01:25:18.029
He'll be here.

01:25:33.587 --> 01:25:35.463
Yeah, who is it?

01:25:35.672 --> 01:25:37.548
Hey, Elmo, it's Louden.

01:25:41.595 --> 01:25:42.971
Hey, come in, kid.

01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:44.472
I'm getting dressed.

01:25:44.681 --> 01:25:46.140
I was at the hotel.

01:25:46.350 --> 01:25:48.977
They told me you
took the night off.

01:25:49.186 --> 01:25:52.480
I thought you were
sick or something.

01:25:52.689 --> 01:25:55.983
Of course I took
the night off, dummy.

01:25:56.193 --> 01:26:00.488
Isn't this the night
you wrestle Shute?

01:26:00.697 --> 01:26:02.990
You took the night off for that?

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:05.994
Yeah. Shaved, got a
haircut and everything.

01:26:06.203 --> 01:26:07.996
You never took a night off

01:26:08.205 --> 01:26:09.998
to see me wrestle before.

01:26:10.207 --> 01:26:12.000
They'll dock you for that.

01:26:12.209 --> 01:26:14.586
Hey, kid, money
ain't everything.

01:26:16.129 --> 01:26:19.006
It's not that big a deal.

01:26:19.216 --> 01:26:21.301
It's six lousy
minutes on the mat.

01:26:23.470 --> 01:26:25.847
You ever hear of Pele?

01:26:26.056 --> 01:26:28.600
Yeah. He's a soccer player.

01:26:29.643 --> 01:26:32.395
A very famous soccer player.

01:26:32.604 --> 01:26:35.356
I was in the room here one day,

01:26:35.565 --> 01:26:38.442
watching the Mexican
channel on TV.

01:26:40.654 --> 01:26:43.114
I don't know nothing about Pele.

01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:49.079
I'm watching what he does
with a ball and his feet.

01:26:49.287 --> 01:26:50.579
Next thing I know,

01:26:50.789 --> 01:26:53.082
he jumps up in the air

01:26:53.291 --> 01:26:55.084
and flips into a somersault

01:26:55.293 --> 01:26:58.838
and kicks the ball in
upside-down and backwards.

01:26:59.881 --> 01:27:03.593
The god damn goalie
never knew what hit him.

01:27:04.553 --> 01:27:08.431
Pele gets excited,
and he rips off his Jersey

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:10.933
and starts running
around the stadium,

01:27:11.143 --> 01:27:13.937
waving it around over his head.

01:27:14.146 --> 01:27:15.856
Everybody's screaming
in Spanish.

01:27:19.568 --> 01:27:22.529
I'm here sitting
alone in my room...

01:27:23.739 --> 01:27:25.907
And I start crying.

01:27:26.908 --> 01:27:29.368
Yeah, that's right.
I start crying...

01:27:32.414 --> 01:27:33.790
Because another human being,

01:27:33.999 --> 01:27:37.293
a species which
I happen to belong to,

01:27:37.502 --> 01:27:39.045
can kick a ball...

01:27:41.423 --> 01:27:43.049
And lift himself...

01:27:44.426 --> 01:27:47.303
And the rest of us
sad-ass human beings

01:27:47.512 --> 01:27:51.140
up to a better place,
if only for a minute.

01:27:54.102 --> 01:27:55.478
Let me tell you, kid.

01:27:55.687 --> 01:27:58.064
It was pretty god damn glorious.

01:27:59.941 --> 01:28:02.401
It ain't the six minutes.

01:28:03.945 --> 01:28:06.906
It's what happens
in that six minutes.

01:28:10.952 --> 01:28:13.829
Anyway, that's why
I'm getting dressed up

01:28:14.039 --> 01:28:17.417
and giving up a night's pay
for this function.

01:28:23.256 --> 01:28:24.674

01:28:24.883 --> 01:28:26.009

01:28:29.805 --> 01:28:31.181

01:28:31.348 --> 01:28:32.515
Step off.

01:28:32.724 --> 01:28:34.183

01:28:34.392 --> 01:28:36.685

01:28:36.895 --> 01:28:38.187

01:28:38.396 --> 01:28:40.439
Step on the scale, please.

01:28:41.316 --> 01:28:44.527
Hey, Kuch, think
he's going to show?

01:28:44.694 --> 01:28:46.112
He'll show.

01:28:47.322 --> 01:28:49.282
Hoover 108-pounder.

01:28:58.124 --> 01:29:00.209
Actual weight, 215 pounds.

01:29:00.418 --> 01:29:02.378
Step off, please.

01:29:03.588 --> 01:29:06.716
Coach, we can't wait any
longer for your 168-pounder.

01:29:06.925 --> 01:29:08.217
This is a tough one.

01:29:08.426 --> 01:29:09.718
Just five more minutes, ref.

01:29:09.928 --> 01:29:11.220
Just five more minutes.

01:29:11.429 --> 01:29:12.555
Come on, ref.

01:29:12.764 --> 01:29:14.891
You'll be getting
a forfeit at 168.

01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:16.100
Brian Shute.

01:29:16.268 --> 01:29:18.061
Step on to accept your forfeit.

01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:19.521
What's the hurry, Shute?

01:29:19.729 --> 01:29:21.230
You afraid he might show?

01:29:21.439 --> 01:29:23.524
The man's all mouth.

01:29:23.733 --> 01:29:26.360
168 pounds even.
Step off, please.

01:29:26.570 --> 01:29:27.737
Cheap win, Shute.

01:29:27.946 --> 01:29:29.030
Cheap win!

01:29:29.239 --> 01:29:31.532
If he had any guts,
he'd be here.

01:29:31.741 --> 01:29:33.075
If you had any...

01:29:33.285 --> 01:29:34.536
Hey, now, look!

01:29:34.744 --> 01:29:35.744
Hold it!

01:29:35.787 --> 01:29:37.079
Hey, he's here!

01:29:37.289 --> 01:29:38.540
All right, Swain!

01:29:38.748 --> 01:29:40.040
This is him, ref.

01:29:40.250 --> 01:29:42.043
This is our 168... Louden Swain.

01:29:42.252 --> 01:29:43.711
Get him on there.

01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:46.797
Thompson 168-pounder,
step on, please.

01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:55.056
You're over, son.

01:29:55.265 --> 01:29:57.058
I'll double-check the scale.

01:29:57.267 --> 01:29:58.268
Damn.

01:30:11.197 --> 01:30:12.656
Think light.

01:30:26.087 --> 01:30:27.463
168 even.

01:30:27.672 --> 01:30:28.923
Whoo! Yeah!

01:30:29.132 --> 01:30:30.758
All right, you made it.

01:30:30.967 --> 01:30:32.093
You made it.

01:30:32.302 --> 01:30:33.678
You did it!

01:30:34.721 --> 01:30:36.681
Yeah, yeah, look out!

01:30:38.224 --> 01:30:40.684
Listen up a second, fellas.

01:30:41.728 --> 01:30:44.105
This is one special night.

01:30:44.314 --> 01:30:46.316
You know it, and I know it.

01:30:46.524 --> 01:30:50.319
Now let's go out there and make
sure hoover high knows it.

01:30:50.528 --> 01:30:51.904
All right? Let's go.

01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:07.628
Nothing's ever going
to be the same again.

01:31:07.837 --> 01:31:08.963
You're out there now.

01:31:09.172 --> 01:31:10.298
I'm aware, Kuch.

01:31:10.507 --> 01:31:13.968
We got to go
for all the answers.

01:31:14.177 --> 01:31:15.469
Vision quest, man.

01:31:15.679 --> 01:31:18.556
I don't even know the questions.

01:31:20.266 --> 01:31:22.226
You don't have to.

01:31:40.286 --> 01:31:41.745
You here alone?

01:31:52.799 --> 01:31:57.261
Good. I was afraid
I'd see 20 bare-ass boys.

01:32:01.808 --> 01:32:04.352
Did you make the weight?

01:32:04.561 --> 01:32:05.895
You just took off.

01:32:06.104 --> 01:32:07.897
You didn't even say goodbye.

01:32:08.106 --> 01:32:10.399
If I hadn't,
you wouldn't even be here.

01:32:10.608 --> 01:32:12.234
You were ready to forget it.

01:32:12.444 --> 01:32:14.904
What should I say, thank you?

01:32:15.113 --> 01:32:17.406
I don't want you
to say anything.

01:32:17.615 --> 01:32:21.410
I just think people should
do what they set out to do.

01:32:21.619 --> 01:32:22.661
Do you?

01:32:25.331 --> 01:32:28.709
Louden, I didn't
mean to hurt you.

01:32:28.918 --> 01:32:31.795
I never wanted to do that.

01:32:39.846 --> 01:32:43.808
I just didn't know
how to say goodbye.

01:32:51.858 --> 01:32:53.317
So goodbye.

01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:55.819
Carla.

01:33:08.374 --> 01:33:10.834
I'd do it all again.

01:33:13.379 --> 01:33:14.838
So would I.

01:33:24.724 --> 01:33:26.100
Hey, Louden.

01:33:26.309 --> 01:33:27.685

Coach, we got a bloody nose here.

You're killing him.

01:40:50.795 --> 01:40:51.921
Shut up, Kuch.

01:40:57.218 --> 01:40:59.595
Have you done everything
you came to do?

01:40:59.804 --> 01:41:01.096
Not yet.

01:41:01.305 --> 01:41:03.598
Then do it.

01:41:03.808 --> 01:41:05.100
You're down 4 points.

01:41:05.309 --> 01:41:07.602
