05:22.200 --> 05:23.840
- The Kasaavin took him.
- Yes.

to their dimension

...if he escaped,
I could track him.

Yes. And there's plenty
here to regulate.

11:49.640 --> 11:51.920
For starters, you don't
have jurisdiction here.

11:51.960 --> 11:55.240
So why you're using
a Class Seven Enforcement Field

11:55.280 --> 11:57.240
around this city
bothers me a lot.

11:57.280 --> 11:58.360
More importantly,

11:58.400 --> 12:00.000
this temporal isolator

12:00.040 --> 12:01.840
is an outlawed piece of kit.

12:01.880 --> 12:04.880
Radiation leakage
and civilian casualties.

12:04.920 --> 12:06.360
Designed to freeze time
but causes

12:06.400 --> 12:07.800
horrific collateral damage

12:07.840 --> 12:08.920
to anything and anyone

12:08.960 --> 12:10.520
that gets in its path.
Horrible thing.

12:10.560 --> 12:12.080
Hey, you're not using
that thing here, pal,

12:12.120 --> 12:15.000
so consider your rhino backside
imperially regulated.

12:15.040 --> 12:16.480
(SNARLS)

12:16.520 --> 12:17.920
It sounded tougher in me head.

12:17.960 --> 12:21.720
Fugitive is highly dangerous.
Precautions must be taken.

12:21.760 --> 12:25.760
Not that weapon, not here.
Humans will die, and you,

12:25.800 --> 12:27.840
Captain, will have racked up
enough violations

12:27.880 --> 12:30.120
to ensure that your troop
never get hired again.

12:30.160 --> 12:31.120
(GROWLS)

12:31.160 --> 12:34.600
Look at you and your platoon
of Judoon near the...

12:35.960 --> 12:36.960
...that lagoon.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.120
More of a canal.

12:38.160 --> 12:39.880
- RYAN: Yeah.
- Where's your pride?

12:39.920 --> 12:41.360
(GROWLS)

12:41.400 --> 12:43.280
Where's your respect
for the rules?

12:43.320 --> 12:45.040
I'm very disappointed in you.

12:45.080 --> 12:46.480
(GRUNTS)

12:46.520 --> 12:48.200
So, we will take over from
here.

12:48.240 --> 12:49.480
Negative!

12:49.520 --> 12:52.160
Mission must be fulfilled
by the contracted troop.

12:52.200 --> 12:55.440
Judoon Engagement Article 163B!

12:55.480 --> 12:57.840
That article...is overridden

12:57.880 --> 12:59.360
by local Earth law...

12:59.400 --> 13:00.400
...12...

13:00.440 --> 13:01.920
(GRUNTS)

13:01.960 --> 13:04.760
...which clearly states
that any potential arrestee

13:04.800 --> 13:07.240
is entitled to arbitration
with a third party.

13:07.280 --> 13:08.800
Isn't that correct,

13:08.840 --> 13:10.600
Liaison Officer Khan?

13:10.640 --> 13:12.960
Absolutely correct. 100%.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.120
Rule 12? Massive.

13:15.160 --> 13:16.960
Imperial regulation.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.440
So you will give us the time
to go in there and arbitrate.

13:20.480 --> 13:22.480
That weapon will not
need to be used.

13:22.520 --> 13:24.160
- Clear?
- (GRUNTS)

13:24.200 --> 13:27.640
Come on! We can sort this,
woman to woman.

13:29.160 --> 13:30.400
Give me ten Earth minutes

13:30.440 --> 13:31.880
and we can have this
resolved for you.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.480
Five minutes.

13:34.520 --> 13:35.640
- Nine.
- Four!

13:35.680 --> 13:37.440
Er, fine. I'll take five.

13:37.480 --> 13:39.240
I hate it when they do that.

13:39.280 --> 13:41.640
We'd best take the lift.
Hang on, where's Graham?

13:41.680 --> 13:43.320
- I don't know.
- Have you lost him?

13:43.360 --> 13:44.440
He's not my responsibility.

13:44.480 --> 13:46.880
He's always a few steps behind.
I've stopped checking.

13:46.920 --> 13:48.040
Four minutes thirty.

13:48.080 --> 13:50.440
We haven't started yet!
Come on.

13:52.560 --> 13:55.280
(GROANS)

14:06.120 --> 14:07.400
(AMERICAN ACCENT) Don't move.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.880
Seriously, not a muscle.

14:09.920 --> 14:11.720
Working on
the movement sensors.

14:11.760 --> 14:14.640
If you even flinch,
it'll set off the laser spikes.

14:14.680 --> 14:17.400
Trust me, they get everywhere.

14:17.440 --> 14:20.320
By the way, lookin' good.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.920
Who is this? What's going on?

14:22.960 --> 14:24.640
Where am I? And where are you?

14:25.920 --> 14:27.800
Neutralised.

14:27.840 --> 14:29.760
Comin' to join you.

14:29.800 --> 14:32.000
You can get excited now.

14:32.040 --> 14:35.160
Ha! You missed me, right?

14:36.320 --> 14:37.680
Ha-ha!

14:43.640 --> 14:45.040
Have we met?

14:46.080 --> 14:48.440
Still cheeky.
Regeneration can't change that.

14:48.480 --> 14:49.800
Gotta say, loving the grey

14:49.840 --> 14:51.120
at the temple.

14:51.160 --> 14:53.720
Kinda distinguished
yet still sexy.

14:54.440 --> 14:56.320
- Oh, come here!
- Whoa!

14:59.040 --> 15:01.320
How you been, Doctor?

15:01.360 --> 15:02.520
Ah.

15:03.640 --> 15:07.640
Pay attention, cos every word
I'm about to say is true.

15:07.680 --> 15:09.920
There's a nasty bunch
of alien police outside.

15:09.960 --> 15:12.960
They're pointing a highly
dangerous cannon at this flat,

15:13.000 --> 15:15.840
and they'll fire it
in about, er, four minutes.

15:15.880 --> 15:18.240
I might be able to stop them,
but I need to understand

15:18.280 --> 15:21.040
exactly why they're here, so
you need to let us in, quick.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.560
Right, tell us everything.

15:25.600 --> 15:27.360
Who are you? We need to leave!

15:27.400 --> 15:29.320
Right into the arms of
intergalactic mercenaries

15:29.360 --> 15:32.600
who seem to think you are
a fugitive from justice.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.400
- They've got it wrong.
- Sure about that?

15:34.440 --> 15:35.960
Yeah! It's mistaken identity.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.400
He works at Bathrooms4U,
for God's sake!

15:38.440 --> 15:41.000
You'd better be telling
the truth, both of you,

15:41.040 --> 15:42.880
otherwise the Judoon
will have you

15:42.920 --> 15:45.680
for harbouring the fugitive,
and their justice is brutal.

15:45.720 --> 15:47.640
I'm not harbouring anyone!

15:47.680 --> 15:50.160
If you're both so innocent,
why are your bags packed?

15:50.200 --> 15:51.800
Yeah, like you're about to
go on the run.

15:51.840 --> 15:53.920
Khan and Sinclair
with the key questions.

15:53.960 --> 15:55.280
Not that you'll get very far,

15:55.320 --> 15:57.720
given the enforcement perimeter
they've just knocked up.

15:57.760 --> 15:59.040
Come on, quick with the truth!

15:59.080 --> 16:01.320
We've got about three minutes,
probably less.

16:01.360 --> 16:03.000
What are you hiding?

16:03.040 --> 16:04.240
Check the flat,

16:04.280 --> 16:05.360
see what's here.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.000
If it isn't these two, it could
be something inside here.

16:07.040 --> 16:08.160
You're not
going through my flat!

16:08.200 --> 16:09.120
Yes, they are.

16:09.160 --> 16:10.560
Have you seen
those things outside?

16:10.600 --> 16:11.960
Yeah, and I've seen
what they do,

16:12.000 --> 16:13.280
and that's why we're running.

16:13.320 --> 16:14.400
- (SONIC WHIRS)
- What are you doing?

16:14.440 --> 16:17.160
- What is that?!
- A device that tells me...

16:20.200 --> 16:23.080
...you're both
completely human.

16:24.240 --> 16:25.880
Please,

16:25.920 --> 16:29.000
I'm trying to save a lot of
lives here, including yours.

16:29.040 --> 16:31.680
If you have any idea why
the Judoon are pursuing you,

16:31.720 --> 16:33.600
you have to tell me right now.

16:38.800 --> 16:41.360
What the...?
What's happening out there?

16:41.400 --> 16:43.080
I guess they want
their ship back.

16:43.120 --> 16:44.320
What, this ain't your ship?

16:44.360 --> 16:45.680
You think I'd choose this look?

16:45.720 --> 16:47.400
Doesn't even have a bar!

16:48.920 --> 16:50.240
A little evasive action.

16:50.280 --> 16:54.000
Hoping these shields
are as good as they say.

16:54.040 --> 16:55.800
A few battles
going on around us...

16:56.800 --> 17:00.440
You're not just kidding me?
You're really not the Doctor?

17:00.480 --> 17:03.320
Oh, no, no. My name's Graham.
I just travel with the Doc.

17:03.360 --> 17:06.760
Ha! Which is why the scoop
read the wrong signal!

17:06.800 --> 17:08.520
Ho-ho, using the old
Quanticum Scoop

17:08.560 --> 17:11.120
I got from a fourple
on Ibiza 13... Whoo!

17:11.160 --> 17:13.240
That was a night!

17:13.280 --> 17:15.480
Actually, that was a month.

17:15.520 --> 17:18.000
Well, look, now you know
who I am, tell me who you are,

17:18.040 --> 17:20.080
why you've kidnapped me
and why you're after the Doc.

17:20.120 --> 17:22.080
I mean, we're in the middle
of something right now.

17:22.120 --> 17:24.440
Captain Jack Harkness
at your service.

17:24.480 --> 17:26.800
Me and the Doc, we go way back.

17:26.840 --> 17:27.880
This is important.

17:27.920 --> 17:31.160
He needs to know the future
of the universe is at stake.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.520
Not he, she.

17:32.560 --> 17:34.800
(LAUGHS)

17:34.840 --> 17:35.920
Oh!

17:37.160 --> 17:38.200
This I gotta see.

17:39.400 --> 17:42.040
Temporal isolator primed,
Captain.

17:42.080 --> 17:44.720
Prepare Final Warning Missile.

17:46.280 --> 17:47.400
Find anything?

17:47.440 --> 17:48.720
A few cash-flow problems,

17:48.760 --> 17:50.800
a collection of old phones
and keys.

17:50.840 --> 17:52.440
I found this in the bedroom.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.640
Hollow compartment
at the back of the wardrobe.

17:54.680 --> 17:55.880
(SONIC WHIRS)

17:55.920 --> 17:57.280
And that...

17:57.320 --> 17:58.680
...is not from Earth.

17:58.720 --> 18:00.200
So where's it from?

18:00.240 --> 18:02.360
- (WHOOSHING)
- (GLASS SHATTERS)

18:02.400 --> 18:04.320
- Oh, my God!
- What was that?!

18:04.360 --> 18:06.280
This came flying
through the window.

18:06.320 --> 18:08.800
Isolation of fugitive
housing unit

18:08.840 --> 18:10.920
in 108 seconds.

18:10.960 --> 18:12.760
Doesn't time fly when you don't
have all the answers?

18:12.800 --> 18:14.960
So, anyone know what this is?

18:15.000 --> 18:16.320
No, I've never seen it before.

18:16.360 --> 18:18.000
Me neither.

18:19.400 --> 18:20.760
We found it hidden
in your bedroom.

18:21.640 --> 18:23.040
You'd better be
telling the truth,

18:23.080 --> 18:24.520
cos there's a lot of
innocent people

18:24.560 --> 18:26.440
that could die if we don't
sort this out quick.

18:26.480 --> 18:27.520
92 seconds.

18:33.120 --> 18:34.640
Give me the box.

18:36.560 --> 18:37.640
82 seconds.

18:37.680 --> 18:39.960
Give me the box.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.680
- Lee? What is that?
- It's nothing.

18:42.720 --> 18:44.520
No, it clearly is something,

18:44.560 --> 18:46.920
cos suddenly you're
all bothered about it,

18:46.960 --> 18:48.600
and I've never seen it
before in my life.

18:50.680 --> 18:51.840
You're in charge, right?

18:51.880 --> 18:53.520
It's a very flat
team structure.

18:53.560 --> 18:56.120
You're the smartest.
I can see it in your eyes.

18:56.160 --> 18:59.280
Use the fire exit out the back.
Take Ruth.

18:59.320 --> 19:01.360
Get her out
and make sure she's OK.

19:01.400 --> 19:02.600
I can take care of this.

19:02.640 --> 19:04.080
What? No, you can't!

19:04.120 --> 19:06.240
What's in the box, Lee?
Who are you really?

19:06.280 --> 19:07.480
It's none of your business.

19:10.560 --> 19:12.720
You've got half of Gloucester
under Judoon lockdown.

19:12.760 --> 19:14.080
I'm making it my business.

19:14.120 --> 19:15.440
45 seconds.

19:15.480 --> 19:17.840
I can deal with this.

19:17.880 --> 19:20.160
Just take Ruth.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.560
40 seconds.

19:21.600 --> 19:23.600
Look, I've...
I've made a mistake.

19:25.080 --> 19:27.160
You're the most important thing
in my life.

19:28.160 --> 19:29.720
I can't let others
lose their lives.

19:29.760 --> 19:31.520
I need to make sure
you're safe.

19:31.560 --> 19:32.440
What do you mean, "a mistake"?

19:32.480 --> 19:34.800
I just need
to talk to them, OK?

19:34.840 --> 19:36.440
But they're space rhinos, Lee.

19:36.480 --> 19:37.600
What are you going to
chat to them about?

19:37.640 --> 19:39.480
- 23 seconds.
- They'll see us

19:39.520 --> 19:40.840
getting out of the fire escape.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.560
- Unless...
- (TOGETHER) Diversion!

19:42.600 --> 19:43.800
Look, you take Ruth.
We'll go out the front

19:43.840 --> 19:45.000
and distract the space feds.

19:45.040 --> 19:46.160
- You think that'll work?
- Come on!

19:46.200 --> 19:47.800
No, cos I'm not going anywhere
without Lee.

19:47.840 --> 19:49.880
I'm a police officer.
I speak their language.

19:49.920 --> 19:51.840
A bit of stalling,
buy time to get them away.

19:51.880 --> 19:54.120
Then we can come inside
with them and be by your side.

19:54.160 --> 19:55.520
I don't need you to be here.

19:55.560 --> 19:56.600
You obviously do,

19:56.640 --> 19:58.440
because there's a cannon
about to fire at your flat.

19:58.480 --> 20:01.800
Time limit exceeded.
Initiating temporal isolation.

20:01.840 --> 20:02.960
We're out of time.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.640
It's the best plan we've got
for keeping this block safe.

20:04.680 --> 20:06.160
Right, be careful.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.560
The Judoon might look dumb,
but they're deadly.

20:08.600 --> 20:10.280
Go to the cathedral.
I'll meet you there.

20:10.320 --> 20:11.560
- OK?
- You better.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.760
Not going to miss
your birthday, am I?

20:13.800 --> 20:15.080
Go, go, go,

20:15.120 --> 20:16.720
before they launch that thing.

20:16.760 --> 20:18.040
...Full documentation
available on request.

20:18.080 --> 20:19.160
See you at the cathedral.

20:19.200 --> 20:21.240
Activate Temporal Blast.

20:21.280 --> 20:23.240
(WHIRRING)

20:23.280 --> 20:24.960
Stop!

20:25.000 --> 20:26.400
Arbitration complete.

20:26.440 --> 20:27.880
Arbitration result?

20:27.920 --> 20:29.480
You can come in now.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.280
So long as you turn that off.

20:31.320 --> 20:34.240

32:04.800 --> 32:07.000
Loved it so much
they wanted to be buried here?

32:07.040 --> 32:08.200
Yep.

32:08.240 --> 32:09.480
- You'd moved away by then.
- Yeah.

32:09.520 --> 32:11.440

the lighthouse?

32:11.480 --> 32:13.080
Yeah, they left it to me.

But I never wanted to
come back here to live, though.

to Gloucester?

Yes.

Hi. Struggling with this.
Can you just...?

37:11.200 --> 37:13.760
No, I can't. Not right now.
No time.

37:13.800 --> 37:16.400
Just stand there
and don't ask questions.

37:16.440 --> 37:19.040
Sorry you got caught up
in all this,

37:19.080 --> 37:21.320
but if Gat is half the
operative she used to be,

37:21.360 --> 37:23.120
she's already figured out
where we are.

37:23.160 --> 37:24.360
And we need to be ready,

37:24.400 --> 37:25.480
and we're not.

- You can't be.
- Yeah? And why's that?

Because I'm The Doctor.

and trousers that don't reach?

No, how did I end up like you?

You don't.

been you, which I haven't.

or you should know me.

38:32.960 --> 38:34.040
Yeah, that's the one.

38:34.080 --> 38:35.920

one day, and now she has.

No, really,
don't point it at me.

41:03.640 --> 41:05.200

you've got a contract,
fair enough. But you?

because she left her job?

41:37.120 --> 41:38.360

Is that what she told you?

41:41.040 --> 41:43.120

44:12.760 --> 44:15.040
Don't take the moral
high ground with me.

44:15.080 --> 44:16.880
Crime has been witnessed.

44:16.920 --> 44:17.880
RUTH: No crime.

44:17.920 --> 44:19.480
- (SNARLS)
- An accident.

44:19.520 --> 44:23.680
And, besides, a Judoonese
Talwak Freighter like this,

44:23.720 --> 44:26.240
moving at 80 million clicks
an hour,

44:26.280 --> 44:28.760
entered interstellar space...

44:28.800 --> 44:30.200
...12 seconds ago.

44:31.320 --> 44:36.520
No-one has jurisdiction
in interstellar space.

44:36.560 --> 44:40.600
So no laws, and no crime.

44:40.640 --> 44:42.440
Isn't that right, Doctor?

44:44.880 --> 44:46.520
Yes.

44:46.560 --> 44:48.680
- (RIFLE BEEPS)
- Recalibrated.

44:48.720 --> 44:50.160
Who wants some?

44:50.200 --> 44:52.400
The Doctor never uses weapons.

44:52.440 --> 44:54.040
I know. Shut up!

44:55.360 --> 44:57.160
We're leaving now.

44:57.200 --> 44:58.920
(GROWLS)

44:58.960 --> 45:03.320
If you know what's good for
you, do not come for me again.

45:03.360 --> 45:05.120
Ever.

45:05.160 --> 45:09.280
Consider your
contract cancelled.

45:09.320 --> 45:10.480
(SNARLS)

45:10.520 --> 45:14.320
JUDOON: Judoon contracts will
always be fulfilled!

45:18.000 --> 45:20.280
Homing in your TARDIS signal.

45:21.520 --> 45:22.960
Can't get too close.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.240
Imagine the temporal
feedback loop.

45:26.800 --> 45:28.480
I'll drop you at the docks
near my flat.

45:28.520 --> 45:30.160
How's that?

45:30.200 --> 45:31.720
You can't be me.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.960
I know what I've done,
I know my own life.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.560
One of us has to be wrong.

45:36.600 --> 45:38.600
(TARDIS THRUMS)

45:40.400 --> 45:42.520
(THUD)

45:44.520 --> 45:46.800
I'd quite like it
if you got off my ship now.

45:49.920 --> 45:50.920
YAZ: There she is!

45:52.160 --> 45:53.680
Doctor! Found you.

45:54.960 --> 45:57.320
RYAN: Hey, what happened?
Where you been?

45:57.360 --> 46:00.320
What happened to Ruth?
The Judoon things are gone.

46:00.360 --> 46:01.720
You're never going to guess
what happened to us.

46:01.760 --> 46:03.480
Captain Jack Harkness
said hello.

46:03.520 --> 46:05.240
What?

46:05.280 --> 46:07.240
GRAHAM: "Beware
the lone Cyberman.

46:07.280 --> 46:10.840
"Do not let it have
what it wants, at all costs."

46:10.880 --> 46:12.080
That's all he said?

46:12.120 --> 46:13.520
RYAN: Yeah, he got interrupted.

46:13.560 --> 46:14.560
YAZ: Who is he, anyway?

46:15.800 --> 46:17.160
An old friend.

46:17.200 --> 46:18.600
I liked him.

46:18.640 --> 46:20.560
Kinda cheesy.

46:20.600 --> 46:22.200
But good cheesy.

46:22.240 --> 46:23.480
That's Jack.

46:24.600 --> 46:26.960
He didn't say any more
about the Cybermen?

46:27.000 --> 46:29.320
Er, he said that
they were fallen empire

46:29.360 --> 46:30.920
and they should stay that way.

46:32.360 --> 46:34.680
What are they, these Cybermen?

46:34.720 --> 46:36.880
They're one of the most
dangerous species

46:36.920 --> 46:39.600
I've ever encountered,
up there with the Daleks.

46:39.640 --> 46:41.960
Oh, I can't wait to meet then,
then.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.400
And they're in our future?

46:43.440 --> 46:45.600
They're always somewhere...

46:46.760 --> 46:48.000
...waiting.

46:48.040 --> 46:51.880
You haven't told us about Lee
and Ruth and the Judoon.

46:51.920 --> 46:53.760
Who was the fugitive?

46:57.480 --> 46:58.560
It was Ruth.

47:00.480 --> 47:02.520
But Ruth was me.

47:02.560 --> 47:03.600
What?

47:04.680 --> 47:06.400
What are you talking about?

47:06.440 --> 47:07.600
How's that possible?

47:07.640 --> 47:11.680
She said she was my past,
but I know my past.

47:11.720 --> 47:13.160
And she's never been me.

47:13.200 --> 47:15.160
I'm sure there's
a simple explanation.

47:16.240 --> 47:19.360
Time is swirling around me.

47:19.400 --> 47:23.160
The Master,
Captain Jack Harkness, Ruth.

47:25.880 --> 47:27.600
Something's coming for me.

47:29.040 --> 47:30.200
I can feel it.

47:30.240 --> 47:31.920
Let it come.

47:31.960 --> 47:33.080
You've got us.

47:33.120 --> 47:34.640
Ryan...

47:35.720 --> 47:39.120
...I've lived for thousands of
years, so long I've lost count.

47:39.160 --> 47:41.760
I've had so many faces.
How long have you been here?

47:43.240 --> 47:44.520
You don't know me.

47:45.800 --> 47:47.160
Not even a little bit.

47:47.200 --> 47:48.480
Don't talk to him like that!

47:48.520 --> 47:50.040
Yeah, I'm not having that.

47:50.080 --> 47:51.960
We do know who you are.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.200
You're the woman
that brought us together,

47:54.240 --> 47:57.160
the woman that saved us
and loads of other people.

48:01.040 --> 48:03.120
You're The Doctor.

48:04.840 --> 48:07.720
Whoever you were in the past
or are in the future,

48:07.760 --> 48:10.120
we know who you are right now.

48:10.160 --> 48:11.360
Right?

48:11.400 --> 48:12.640
Right!

48:12.680 --> 48:14.640
The best person we know.

48:14.680 --> 48:18.040
And whatever is coming
for you, we'll be here.

48:18.080 --> 48:19.320
Cos we're your mates.

48:19.360 --> 48:22.040
Well, not just mates. Family.

48:22.080 --> 48:23.080
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

48:24.760 --> 48:27.120
So, whether you
want to go looking

48:27.160 --> 48:28.600
for whatever trouble's coming,

48:28.640 --> 48:30.240
or whether you want
to wait here

48:30.280 --> 48:31.760
and let it come to you...

48:33.000 --> 48:35.200
...we'll be right here,
by your side,

48:35.240 --> 48:37.520
like it or not, Doctor.

48:37.560 --> 48:39.840
(ALARM BLARES)

48:39.880 --> 48:41.720
What's that?

48:41.760 --> 48:43.120
I know what you're doing -

48:43.160 --> 48:45.040
siding with them,
distracting me.

48:45.080 --> 48:47.360
You're doing this deliberately.

48:47.400 --> 48:48.960
Whoa!

48:49.000 --> 48:52.600
Multiple alerts across
three continents here on Earth.

48:52.640 --> 48:55.200
Can't be connected.
Unless they are.

48:55.240 --> 48:56.240
Quick look?

48:57.920 --> 48:59.680
Quick look.

48:59.720 --> 49:01.560
Let's go.

49:32.560 --> 49:34.560
Need some help over here!

49:34.600 --> 49:37.720
Two identical deaths
on two different continents.

49:37.760 --> 49:40.440
It's even more dangerous
than I thought.

49:40.480 --> 49:41.760
This can't be happening.
