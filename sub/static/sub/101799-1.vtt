WEBVTT

01:07.601 --> 01:09.703
Another day
to live through.

01:09.703 --> 01:11.272
Better get started.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.919
- You know, if you
took the stairs more,

05:18.919 --> 05:20.388
you might catch me next time.

05:22.723 --> 05:23.957
- I don't know if
you're aware of this

05:23.957 --> 05:26.226
but you're in handcuffs
right now, buddy.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.196
- Yeah, but that's not
because you caught me.

05:29.196 --> 05:30.364
Now, you wouldn't
have stood a chance

05:30.364 --> 05:33.200
if that freak
didn't snitch on me.

05:34.568 --> 05:36.637
- You mean the elderly
citizen who restrained you?

05:39.907 --> 05:41.442
- Well, I didn't wanna hurt him.

05:42.309 --> 05:43.176
- Right.

05:59.126 --> 06:00.428
- Hold the door.

06:57.350 --> 07:00.053
- Got an audition to be at.

07:00.053 --> 07:01.622
- See if you can
call the front desk.

07:08.361 --> 07:09.162
Yeah.

07:09.162 --> 07:10.531
- Yeah. Hi.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.700
So the elevator's stuck.

07:12.700 --> 07:13.534
You kiddin' me.

07:13.534 --> 07:15.268
This crap's gettin' old.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.204
- Wait, how often
does this happen?

07:17.204 --> 07:18.706
Look, I'll get
the elevator company

07:18.706 --> 07:21.041
over here just as soon as I can.

07:21.041 --> 07:24.077
Okay. And how
long has this gonna take?

07:24.077 --> 07:25.546
Shouldn't be too long.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.815
Could you be
more specific with the time?

07:27.815 --> 07:29.316
No.

07:29.316 --> 07:30.818
Sorry about this, everyone.

07:30.818 --> 07:33.587
We'll have you out of
there as soon as we can.

07:33.587 --> 07:36.089
- Let me see if there's
anything I can do about this.

07:38.058 --> 07:40.027
1306 to 782.

07:41.562 --> 07:42.496
You guys out?

07:42.496 --> 07:43.697
I'm in front waiting.

07:43.697 --> 07:46.133
- Actually, we're
stuck on the elevator.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.000
Are you serious?

07:47.000 --> 07:49.002
Are you guys alone?

07:49.002 --> 07:50.237
- Negative.

07:50.237 --> 07:52.305
How soon you think you
can have us out of here?

07:52.305 --> 07:54.441
Daniels, I hate
to break it to you,

07:54.441 --> 07:55.909
but I think you're
on elevator patrol

07:55.909 --> 07:57.410
for the afternoon, kid.

07:57.410 --> 07:59.980
I gotta go. I'm getting
a call for a 1016.

08:01.248 --> 08:03.150
- Okay. Stay safe.

08:04.885 --> 08:08.121
- Well, looks like we're not
going anywhere for a while.

08:08.121 --> 08:10.123
We should probably
take these off, yeah?

08:11.291 --> 08:12.526
- So you're new
to the force, huh?

08:14.161 --> 08:14.995
I'm sorry.

08:15.996 --> 08:16.830
I'm Connor.

08:18.365 --> 08:19.432
- Officer Daniels.

08:20.634 --> 08:21.769
- And what's your name?

08:24.071 --> 08:24.972
- Me?
- Yeah.

08:24.972 --> 08:26.273
- Oh, sorry.

08:26.273 --> 08:27.107
Just not you used to
anybody talking to me

08:27.107 --> 08:29.376
while I'm cuffed.

08:29.376 --> 08:30.611
I'm Mason.

08:30.611 --> 08:32.012
- Well, it's nice
to meet you, Mason.

08:32.012 --> 08:32.946
- Sir, let's avoid
touching the perp please.

08:32.946 --> 08:33.781
- Sorry.

08:37.017 --> 08:40.588
Man, they're trying to freeze
us to death in here or what?

08:40.588 --> 08:42.990
- Dude, it's boiling in here.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.224
- You're warm?

08:44.224 --> 08:49.229
- Yeah.

08:58.471 --> 08:59.940
What's happening?

08:59.940 --> 09:01.975
- It's all right. They're
just working on the elevator.

09:01.975 --> 09:03.677
- What are you talking about?

09:03.677 --> 09:04.645
It's not all right.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.315
I'm gonna miss my audition
no thanks to this brat.

09:08.315 --> 09:10.584
Everything was fine
until you got here.

09:10.584 --> 09:12.019
- Sir, lower your voice.

09:12.019 --> 09:13.987
- Do you know what you've done?

09:13.987 --> 09:15.923
This was going to be
my role of a lifetime.

09:15.923 --> 09:17.524
I was going to make it.

09:23.964 --> 09:24.965
Excuse me, everyone.

09:28.335 --> 09:29.970
Connor here.

09:29.970 --> 09:30.971
Hey, Jen.

09:30.971 --> 09:31.772
Hey.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.007
Yeah.

09:34.007 --> 09:36.376
Well, the craziest
thing just happened.

09:36.376 --> 09:38.411
The elevator got stuck.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.913
Yeah.

09:39.913 --> 09:44.618
So unfortunately I don't think
I can get to this audition.

09:46.519 --> 09:48.021
Well, I was wondering,

09:48.021 --> 09:51.358
is there any possibility I
could schedule another one?

09:52.292 --> 09:53.794
No, it's okay.

09:53.794 --> 09:55.462
No, I totally understand.

09:55.462 --> 09:56.697
Okay.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.666
Well, hopefully we'll
be working together

09:58.666 --> 09:59.800
sometime in the future.

10:00.801 --> 10:01.869
Okay.

10:01.869 --> 10:03.070
Thank you so much.

10:03.070 --> 10:04.805
Thank you, I appreciate it.

10:04.805 --> 10:06.139
Talk to you soon.

10:06.139 --> 10:06.974
All right, bye.

10:10.110 --> 10:10.911
C'est la vie.

10:18.385 --> 10:19.619
What's up?

10:19.619 --> 10:21.254
- I think you owe
her an apology.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.326
- I'm sorry, did
I miss something?

10:27.594 --> 10:28.729
- You yelled at her.

10:30.097 --> 10:31.498
- When the lights went out?

10:31.498 --> 10:33.400
You blamed her for
missing your audition.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.268
- It's fine. Can we
just drop it please?

10:37.170 --> 10:39.172
- I don't know what you
guys are talking about.

10:39.172 --> 10:43.076
I mean, I'm gonna miss my
audition, but it's okay.

10:43.076 --> 10:44.344
I mean, it could have
been a huge opportunity

10:44.344 --> 10:46.113
but there'll be plenty more.
- Stop it.

10:46.113 --> 10:47.748
You're freaking her
out. Just apologize.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.249
- I'm not freaked out, okay?

10:54.354 --> 10:55.756
- This is a prank, right?

10:55.756 --> 10:56.589
- I don't know.

10:56.589 --> 10:57.390
You tell me.

10:59.592 --> 11:01.528
- I'm really sorry.

11:01.528 --> 11:03.831
- We're not the ones you
need to apologize to.

11:08.969 --> 11:09.803
- Hey.

11:11.338 --> 11:12.172
Hello?

11:14.107 --> 11:16.143
I'm Connor.
- Yeah, you're Connor.

11:16.143 --> 11:18.411
You said that to
everybody here already.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.381
- Well, what's your name?

11:21.381 --> 11:22.215
- Jacqui.

11:27.087 --> 11:27.921
Okay.

11:35.796 --> 11:36.629
- Jacqui.

11:38.832 --> 11:41.969
I'm really sorry for
whatever happened back there.

11:44.637 --> 11:46.506
I'm seriously really
sorry that I scared you .

11:46.506 --> 11:48.475
- I'm not scared, okay?

11:48.475 --> 11:49.276
It's fine.

11:52.579 --> 11:55.248
- What's up with the backpack?

11:57.584 --> 12:00.821
- So Connor, why don't you
tell us about yourself?

12:00.821 --> 12:02.289
You're an actor?

12:02.289 --> 12:04.524
- Well, aspiring actor, yes.

12:07.828 --> 12:10.530
- Have you suffered any
head trauma recently?

12:10.530 --> 12:11.799
- Huh?

12:11.799 --> 12:12.699
- Did you hit your
head or anything?

12:12.699 --> 12:13.867
- No.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.202
Are you
taking any substances?

12:16.236 --> 12:17.871
- Are you asking
if I take drugs?

12:17.871 --> 12:20.007
- I'm just concerned
about your wellbeing.

12:20.007 --> 12:21.374
- I don't do drugs.

12:35.555 --> 12:36.857
- Dammit, cop.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.325
Just ask him if
you hear something.

12:38.325 --> 12:40.727
- Do you have power
outages here often?

12:40.727 --> 12:42.830
- This is weird,
even for this place.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.268
- So, it's Olivia, right?

12:48.268 --> 12:49.602
I never caught what you do.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.273
- Mechanical engineer.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.708
- So why do you live here?

12:55.708 --> 12:58.946
I heard at career
day that engineering
jobs pay really well.

12:58.946 --> 13:01.581
- Miss, why aren't you
in school right now?

13:03.316 --> 13:04.384
Help!

13:05.452 --> 13:06.286
- Sir.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.120
Help!

13:08.488 --> 13:10.023
- Sir, the elevator's stuck.

13:10.023 --> 13:11.491
I'm a police officer.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.226
What's going on out there?

13:13.226 --> 13:15.228
My girlfriend's
trying to kill me.

13:15.228 --> 13:17.064
- I've been there before.

13:17.064 --> 13:18.698
- Sir, I need you to
get to a safe place.

13:18.698 --> 13:19.532
I'm gonna send-

13:26.039 --> 13:27.107
1306 to dispatch.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.013
Talk to me. Are you all right?

13:39.953 --> 13:40.787
- Shit!

14:00.140 --> 14:01.141
- Dammit, Mason.

14:22.295 --> 14:23.130
- Asthma.

14:24.998 --> 14:27.634
1306 to dispatch.

14:27.634 --> 14:29.802
- I don't have my inhaler.

14:30.904 --> 14:32.572
- Dispatch, where are you?

14:32.572 --> 14:34.374
- I've got this. Just
take care of Connor, okay.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.243
Jacqui, Jacqui, look at me.

14:36.243 --> 14:37.077
Okay.

14:44.284 --> 14:45.118
- Connor.

14:51.191 --> 14:52.659
- Hi officer. I'm Connor.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.829
- Okay, Connor.

14:56.829 --> 14:59.032
I'm gonna have you sit
down right over here, okay?

15:03.270 --> 15:04.271
- What's wrong with her?

15:04.271 --> 15:07.474
- You can do it, slow breaths.

15:11.644 --> 15:13.546
- Hey, you need to get
the fire department

15:13.546 --> 15:15.048
and an ambulance
down here right now.

15:15.048 --> 15:15.882
- Focus on me.

15:17.517 --> 15:19.086
Let it out, slowly.

15:24.324 --> 15:26.393
Okay. Good, deep breaths.

15:27.627 --> 15:28.528
Okay, good.

15:30.630 --> 15:31.464
Hello?

15:33.100 --> 15:33.967
This is dispatch.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.435
Go ahead, 1306.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.869
Over.

15:36.869 --> 15:39.072
- I'm stuck in an elevator
with three civilians and a perp

15:39.072 --> 15:40.740
in an apartment
building on 5th Avenue.

15:40.740 --> 15:42.309
- It's the Palmer apartments.

15:42.309 --> 15:44.111
- It's the Palmer apartments.

15:44.111 --> 15:46.413
I believe we're stuck somewhere
near the fourth floor.

15:46.413 --> 15:48.448
I'm requesting fire,
medical and backup.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.017
This is an emergency.

15:50.017 --> 15:52.285
I heard a violent
altercation in the hallway

15:52.285 --> 15:54.187
and we have a young
female in here

15:54.187 --> 15:56.389
who's suffering from
respiratory problems,

15:56.389 --> 15:59.059
and a young male suffering
from drug withdrawals

15:59.059 --> 16:01.194
or an overdose or something.

16:01.194 --> 16:02.929
Send help, over

16:02.929 --> 16:04.264
10-4, 1306.

16:04.264 --> 16:05.965
Checking on available
units. Over.

16:05.965 --> 16:06.899
- I don't do drugs.

16:06.899 --> 16:08.701
- See? You got through it.

16:08.701 --> 16:09.869
Won't be long now.

16:09.869 --> 16:11.138
Just keep breathing.
Stay with me.

16:11.138 --> 16:12.339
1306, all
available personnel

16:12.339 --> 16:13.973
are currently handling
other emergencies,

16:13.973 --> 16:16.776
but we will send the
first available units.

16:16.776 --> 16:18.878
ETA is two hours. Over.

16:18.878 --> 16:19.712
- Come again?

16:20.613 --> 16:21.848
ETA is two hours.

16:21.848 --> 16:23.416
We're flooded with
calls right now.

16:23.416 --> 16:24.884
Over.
- It's okay.

16:24.884 --> 16:26.753
They always overestimate the
amount of time they need, okay?

16:26.753 --> 16:27.687
It's okay.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.422
Just keep breathing.

16:29.422 --> 16:33.293
Good. Nice, long breaths.

16:33.293 --> 16:35.728
1306.

16:35.728 --> 16:38.831
- Look, I don't know
if it's fast enough.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.967
This girl's asthma is terrible.

16:40.967 --> 16:43.370
There's gotta be
something else we can do.

16:43.370 --> 16:44.604
Some sort of alternative.

16:45.938 --> 16:47.907
Maybe I can get
some outside help.

16:47.907 --> 16:49.342
Negative, 1306.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.010
Hold tight and wait for us.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.446
I understand the situation,
but the safest thing for you

16:53.446 --> 16:56.149
and everyone in there is to
stay right where you are.

16:56.149 --> 16:58.518
Trying to exit or tamper
with that elevator equipment

16:58.518 --> 17:00.653
creates an incredibly
dangerous situation.

17:00.653 --> 17:01.821
Understood?

17:01.821 --> 17:02.655
Over.

17:03.890 --> 17:05.358
- 10-4.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.593
Over.

17:06.593 --> 17:07.527
Hang in
there, officer.

17:07.527 --> 17:08.761
Over and out.

17:11.731 --> 17:13.466
- It's too long, okay?

17:13.466 --> 17:15.135
Her asthma's really, really bad.

17:15.135 --> 17:17.304
And with him acting like that,

17:17.304 --> 17:19.406
we're gonna need her
inhaler really soon.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.741
- Ma'am, I appreciate your
concern and all your help

17:21.741 --> 17:24.544
but there's nothing
else I can do here.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.213
- Yes, there is, sir.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.582
Look, I have personal
experience with this elevator.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.084
I know how it works.

17:31.084 --> 17:32.219
- What?

17:32.219 --> 17:33.286
- It's a long story, okay?

17:33.286 --> 17:34.987
The point is, I can get us help.

17:34.987 --> 17:36.723
All I need to do is
open these doors.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.491
If we're lucky, we'll
be opening on a floor

17:38.491 --> 17:40.427
and we can just walk
right out of here.

17:40.427 --> 17:42.862
- I can't permit any
tampering with the elevator.

17:44.264 --> 17:45.298
- Tampering's a strong word
for what we'd be doing.

17:45.298 --> 17:47.600
We'd just be opening the doors.

17:48.968 --> 17:50.370
- The dispatcher said
it was dangerous, so-

17:50.370 --> 17:51.204
- No, it's not.

17:52.439 --> 17:53.906
I mean, it's...

17:55.074 --> 17:56.709
There's a slight risk
for only you and me.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.145
Nobody else in this room.

17:59.546 --> 18:01.548
I'm willing to take the risk
and I think you are too.

18:03.883 --> 18:05.485
Why did you become a cop?

18:05.485 --> 18:07.053
To enforce some rules
or to help people?

18:07.053 --> 18:08.054
'cause there's a
girl in this room

18:08.054 --> 18:09.156
that needs your help right now.

18:09.156 --> 18:10.257
So what's it gonna be?

18:21.668 --> 18:22.502
- I can't.

18:29.075 --> 18:29.909
Olivia.

18:31.278 --> 18:32.078
I'm sorry.

18:32.945 --> 18:33.880
- Tell that to her.

18:48.528 --> 18:49.896
- Keep it together, loser.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.413
Jacqui, I need to
see your phone.

19:06.413 --> 19:07.680
- Why?

19:07.680 --> 19:08.948
We need to
call your parents.

19:08.948 --> 19:10.283
- You don't have to
call my dad, I'm...

19:10.283 --> 19:12.619
- He needs to know
what's going on here.

19:12.619 --> 19:13.953
Let's do this the easy way.

19:19.859 --> 19:22.028
- Just do what he says, Jacqui.

19:26.132 --> 19:27.033
Thank you.

19:38.978 --> 19:40.980
Hi, this
is Nathan Fields.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.615
Sorry I couldn't take
your call right now

19:42.615 --> 19:44.183
but please leave me a message

19:44.183 --> 19:47.354
and I'll get back to
you as soon as possible.

19:47.354 --> 19:48.821
- Hi, Mr. Fields.

19:48.821 --> 19:51.724
I'm officer Daniels and I'm
here with your daughter, Jacqui.

19:51.724 --> 19:54.627
And she's having some
asthma issues at the moment.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.195
If you can give me a call
back when you get this,

19:56.195 --> 19:57.597
that would be appreciated.

19:57.597 --> 19:58.431
Thank you.

20:04.271 --> 20:05.104
Connor.

20:06.606 --> 20:07.440
- Sorry.

20:32.198 --> 20:33.266
1306.

20:38.170 --> 20:38.971
- Olivia.

20:42.975 --> 20:45.144
All right, so how do we do this?

20:47.314 --> 20:48.281
- Okay.

20:48.281 --> 20:49.649
Well, we're gonna need his help.

20:51.351 --> 20:52.852
Mason?

20:52.852 --> 20:53.820
With what?

20:53.820 --> 20:55.121
- Somebody needs to watch her.

20:55.121 --> 20:56.823
Otherwise her asthma
is gonna get worse.

20:56.823 --> 20:59.392
- Yeah. He's not exactly
the guy for that job.

21:00.393 --> 21:01.628
- Well, we don't exactly have

21:01.628 --> 21:02.895
a more qualified
candidate, do we?

21:08.368 --> 21:09.201
- Mason.

21:10.136 --> 21:10.970
Get over here.

21:14.507 --> 21:16.476
- So how can I
help, John McClain?

21:16.476 --> 21:18.445
- We need you to
sit with Jacqui.

21:18.445 --> 21:20.246
Just talk to her
and keep her calm

21:20.246 --> 21:21.481
while we open these doors.

21:21.481 --> 21:24.216
- Wait, wait, is that
a request or a command?

21:24.216 --> 21:26.853
Pretty sure you can't force
me to babysit against my will.

21:26.853 --> 21:28.321
- Fine.

21:28.321 --> 21:29.322
Then it's a request.

21:30.490 --> 21:32.792
- Oh well, I'd be
happy to help them.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.126
So what do I get in return?

21:36.996 --> 21:38.565
Come on.
- Just tell us what you want.

21:38.565 --> 21:42.735
- Okay, well, for starters,
take these cuffs off.

21:42.735 --> 21:44.303
No.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.105
We can't trust him.
He's dangerous.

21:46.105 --> 21:47.907
Yeah, 'cause I
might steal your wallet.

21:47.907 --> 21:48.741
- Mason, please.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.210
- Okay. Fine.

21:52.244 --> 21:53.279
I'd take some booze.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.749
- What?
- Yeah. Come on.

21:56.749 --> 21:59.151
I saw you sneaking something
in the corner there.

22:02.054 --> 22:03.890
- Okay. Go.

22:05.091 --> 22:06.793
- And don't let her
look at Connor, okay.

22:06.793 --> 22:09.962
Anything you have to do to
keep your mind off the asthma.

22:09.962 --> 22:11.531
- Yeah, I can do that.

22:19.472 --> 22:20.306
Hi.

22:21.908 --> 22:22.942
- One.

22:22.942 --> 22:24.411
Two.

22:24.411 --> 22:25.211
Three.

22:34.454 --> 22:35.422
- Jeez, take it easy.

22:35.422 --> 22:36.989
You're talking my ear off here.

22:39.225 --> 22:41.428
Oh, so what's in the
bag anyway? Can I look?

22:43.896 --> 22:45.632
I'll just take that as a yes.

22:45.632 --> 22:46.433
Ow!

22:46.433 --> 22:47.366
Easy, kid.

22:47.366 --> 22:48.935
- Don't call me a kid, dumb ass.

22:51.638 --> 22:53.105
- Okay.
- Now what.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.475
- Let go on three.

22:55.475 --> 22:56.443
One.

22:56.443 --> 22:57.343
Two.

22:57.343 --> 22:58.144
Three.

23:01.548 --> 23:04.517
- Well, we're not
getting out that way.

23:05.618 --> 23:07.687
- Maybe we don't have to.

23:08.821 --> 23:10.490
Someone could bring
us the inhaler.

23:12.258 --> 23:13.092
- Olivia.

23:15.194 --> 23:16.496
- You come prepared, girl.

23:18.698 --> 23:19.499
- Thanks.

23:20.667 --> 23:22.902
- We need something to
wedge these doors open.

23:24.937 --> 23:26.105
- Well, we got nothing.

23:28.040 --> 23:29.008
- Would this work?

23:32.211 --> 23:33.045
- That'll do it.

23:41.888 --> 23:43.590
- Hey, officer.

23:43.590 --> 23:44.824
- How are you feeling, Connor?

23:44.824 --> 23:46.325
- Pretty good, really?

23:46.325 --> 23:47.827
- You want some water?

23:47.827 --> 23:48.995
- Sure.

23:48.995 --> 23:50.162
Why not?

23:50.162 --> 23:50.997
- Hey, hey.

23:51.898 --> 23:52.999
You can't look at him.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.770
- They're not watching.
- I'm worried about him.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.238
- You'll still get your booze.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.475
Yeah, I heard you guys talking.

24:02.475 --> 24:05.411
You weren't exactly
quiet and oh yeah,

24:05.411 --> 24:07.246
you were like five
feet over there?

24:07.246 --> 24:10.216
- Look, look, that wasn't
about the booze, okay?

24:10.216 --> 24:12.084
That cop, he thinks he can
make me do whatever he wants.

24:12.084 --> 24:13.419
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:13.419 --> 24:14.654
Just shut up about it, okay?

24:14.654 --> 24:15.488
I get it.

24:18.024 --> 24:19.391
Again, on three.

24:19.391 --> 24:20.226
- Let me see him.

24:26.198 --> 24:28.167
I will punch you again.

24:28.167 --> 24:29.001
- Fine.

24:35.808 --> 24:37.644
- Is he gonna be okay?

24:39.378 --> 24:41.447
- Look, you just worry
about yourself, okay?

24:49.956 --> 24:51.624
- Jack, look at me, it's okay.

24:51.624 --> 24:53.192
Hey, guys.

24:54.594 --> 24:55.595
- That's it!

25:03.903 --> 25:05.071
What happened?

25:05.905 --> 25:07.173
- What did you do?

25:07.173 --> 25:09.208
- Man, look cop, there's
something seriously off

25:09.208 --> 25:10.677
with this dude.

25:10.677 --> 25:13.179
Hey look, his eyes were all
screwed up for a second.

25:13.179 --> 25:15.281
When she saw that, her
asthma flared up again.

25:15.281 --> 25:16.883
You gotta do something
about this guy.

25:16.883 --> 25:17.817
- I knew I couldn't trust you.

25:17.817 --> 25:19.318
- And you're not listening.

25:19.318 --> 25:21.087
Some scary shit just
went down here, okay?

25:21.087 --> 25:22.021
You really gotta do-

25:22.021 --> 25:23.723
- Hey, I don't wanna hear it.

25:24.791 --> 25:26.125
- Officer.

25:26.125 --> 25:27.293
He's telling...
- Jacqui, Jacqui.

25:27.293 --> 25:28.227
Don't talk, okay?

25:28.227 --> 25:30.229
Just focus on your breathing.

25:30.229 --> 25:31.063
Okay?

25:34.266 --> 25:35.467
- Hello!

25:35.467 --> 25:36.402
Can anyone hear me?

25:37.637 --> 25:38.537
We're in the elevator.

25:38.537 --> 25:39.371
We need help.

25:46.412 --> 25:47.847
What are you doing?

25:47.847 --> 25:49.916
- I'm recruiting my sister
to get that inhaler.

25:51.150 --> 25:52.451
Ali.
- Liv, I just heard

25:52.451 --> 25:54.186
a bunch of gunshots in the hall.

25:54.186 --> 25:55.655
- Are you okay?

25:55.655 --> 25:57.023
There's something
going on in the hall.

25:57.023 --> 25:58.958
- Sir, sir, we're
in the elevator.

25:58.958 --> 26:00.760
We need help.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.328
- Okay, just lock the door?

26:02.328 --> 26:03.362
I'm gonna be there
as soon as I can.

26:03.362 --> 26:05.297
Everything's gonna be okay.

26:05.297 --> 26:07.199
Listen, there's someone in
here with really bad asthma.

26:07.199 --> 26:08.567
Can you please go
to her apartment

26:08.567 --> 26:09.568
and get her inhaler?

26:10.737 --> 26:11.871
Please.

26:11.871 --> 26:13.740
- Yes. Yes, of course.

26:13.740 --> 26:16.175
- Thank you. Hold on one sec.

26:17.877 --> 26:20.179
- 605, probably on
the kitchen counter.

26:22.181 --> 26:23.650
- Okay. No, no, no.

26:23.650 --> 26:25.051
Don't put your hand in here.
That's how you lose it.

26:25.051 --> 26:27.186
I'm gonna just toss
it to you, okay?

26:27.186 --> 26:29.288
It's apartment 605.

26:29.288 --> 26:32.224
Probably somewhere on the
kitchen counter, okay?

26:32.224 --> 26:33.492
- All right.

26:33.492 --> 26:34.994
I'll be back as fast as I can.

26:36.162 --> 26:38.264
I'm John from 419.

26:38.264 --> 26:39.531
You're Olivia, right?

26:39.531 --> 26:40.599
I think I've seen
you around before.

26:42.869 --> 26:43.870
Got it. Going.

26:46.572 --> 26:47.406
- Thank you.

26:52.011 --> 26:53.179
- Nice work.

26:53.179 --> 26:54.280
Thanks.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.415
- Nice work yourself, officer.

26:56.415 --> 26:57.216
- Lee.

26:58.918 --> 27:00.386
- I don't know any other Lees.

27:01.453 --> 27:03.155
No, I lied.

27:03.155 --> 27:03.990
Lee Harvey Oswald.

27:03.990 --> 27:04.957
- Oh yeah.

27:04.957 --> 27:05.925
- Yeah.
- Harvey.

27:10.797 --> 27:13.399
- Olivia, officer Lee.

27:13.399 --> 27:15.902
- You didn't hold up
your end of the bargain.

27:15.902 --> 27:17.036
We can't give this guy an inch.

27:17.036 --> 27:19.071
- Come on. Let's keep the peace.

27:20.807 --> 27:25.812
- Oh.

27:26.946 --> 27:27.780
Ooh!

27:29.281 --> 27:30.382
- One drink is plenty.

27:31.250 --> 27:32.651
- Oh, come on.

27:32.651 --> 27:35.521
I'll let you hit me with
public intoxication.

27:35.521 --> 27:37.123
- Here, officer.

27:37.123 --> 27:39.125
You need this more
than any of us.

27:39.125 --> 27:40.559
- I'm not off duty till five.

27:42.528 --> 27:43.963
- You're not gonna offer me any?

27:45.732 --> 27:48.000
What? You don't think
I can handle my liquor?

27:48.000 --> 27:49.368
Is that it?
- Calm down.

27:49.368 --> 27:50.837
Nobody's saying that.

27:50.837 --> 27:51.637
You're just feeling a
little under the weather.

27:51.637 --> 27:52.872
So we're just gonna-

27:52.872 --> 27:54.006
- Don't tell me
how I feel, bitch.

28:02.048 --> 28:03.149
- Don't look at him, Jack.

28:07.053 --> 28:08.287
- Well, hello.

28:08.287 --> 28:09.956
- Do you mind if I
touch your forehead?

28:11.257 --> 28:12.558
- Are you the makeup lady?

28:13.726 --> 28:16.395
I'm really excited
for today's scenes,

28:16.395 --> 28:18.164
especially the kissing one.

28:18.164 --> 28:18.998
- Okay.

28:22.101 --> 28:24.003
Okay, you're really warm.

28:24.003 --> 28:27.239
- Jacqui, can you get us
another water bottle for Connor?

28:31.978 --> 28:33.846
- What if I don't
wanna give him any?

28:33.846 --> 28:35.948
- The fever's making
him act like a weirdo.

28:35.948 --> 28:36.883
Water's gonna help.

28:56.468 --> 28:58.170
- 1306 to 782.

28:59.171 --> 29:00.873
Hey, go ahead 1306.

29:00.873 --> 29:02.408
- Matthews.

29:02.408 --> 29:03.943
What happened? I couldn't
get a hold of you earlier.

29:03.943 --> 29:06.112
I was in
radio silence on the 1016.

29:06.112 --> 29:07.814
It's a long story.

29:07.814 --> 29:09.048
Listen, things are crazy.

29:09.048 --> 29:11.150
So I don't got a
lot of time, kid.

29:11.150 --> 29:12.885
- Things are crazy here too.

29:12.885 --> 29:14.186
We've got a girl
with severe asthma

29:14.186 --> 29:16.722
and a guy who's running
an extremely high fever.

29:16.722 --> 29:18.958
And there's been some violent
sounds in the building.

29:18.958 --> 29:21.593
Yeah. Sounds like
the apartments I remember.

29:21.593 --> 29:22.594
Listen Daniels, I gotta run.

29:22.594 --> 29:25.832
I'm on my way to
a 1034 downtown.

29:25.832 --> 29:27.599
- Did you say a 1034?

29:27.599 --> 29:28.567
Yeah,
I just geared up.

29:28.567 --> 29:29.735
I'm heading there now.

29:31.170 --> 29:34.040
- All right, well, take
care of yourself, partner.

29:34.040 --> 29:35.908
Stay
safe. Over and out.

29:39.846 --> 29:41.180
- What's a 1034?

29:42.581 --> 29:43.415
- Rioting.

29:48.454 --> 29:49.288
- Rioting?

29:56.428 --> 29:57.830
- Here.

29:57.830 --> 29:58.664
- Okay.

30:28.294 --> 30:29.395
Help.

30:29.395 --> 30:30.229
- Shut up.

30:31.463 --> 30:33.365
- Where's everyone going?

30:33.365 --> 30:34.766
What's happening?

30:40.639 --> 30:42.108
- Hey.

30:49.248 --> 30:52.118
- Come on.
- He's trying to get her.

31:07.599 --> 31:08.434
- Jacqui.

31:13.405 --> 31:14.907
Come here, look at me.

31:14.907 --> 31:15.707
We're gonna take one of
those deep, slow breaths.

31:15.707 --> 31:16.508
Okay? Look at me.

31:16.508 --> 31:17.476
No. Slow breaths.

31:20.779 --> 31:23.015
Look at me. Can
you please, Jacqui.

31:23.015 --> 31:24.250
Come on, Jacqui.

31:24.250 --> 31:25.952
- Let me in, let
me in, let me in.

31:25.952 --> 31:27.119
- Inhaler.

31:27.119 --> 31:28.720
- Help me in, Olivia.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.322
- John, give me the inhaler now.

31:35.861 --> 31:36.695
Here, Jacqui.

31:46.772 --> 31:47.573
Oh my God.

31:54.113 --> 31:55.081
- Lee.

31:55.081 --> 31:56.949
I'm really, really sorry, Lee.

32:00.286 --> 32:01.954
- Hey dude, hey don't do that.

32:01.954 --> 32:04.090
- Officer, help me in.

32:04.090 --> 32:05.024
- Sir.

32:05.024 --> 32:06.025
I'm ordering you to stop.

32:06.025 --> 32:07.326
You're gonna get
chopped in half.

32:07.326 --> 32:08.827
- Olivia, pull me in please.

32:09.728 --> 32:10.862
They're coming.

32:10.862 --> 32:11.863
- Who's coming?

32:19.605 --> 32:22.174
- Well, pull me in, pull me in.

32:23.875 --> 32:24.776
Pull, pull.

32:44.363 --> 32:46.332
- Boost me up.
- Olivia, no.

32:46.332 --> 32:48.434
We need to close this.
- Mason, boost me.

32:53.339 --> 32:54.906
John.

32:54.906 --> 32:55.774
Are you all right?

32:57.009 --> 32:58.277
What happened to your leg?

33:00.879 --> 33:05.851
John.

33:15.694 --> 33:17.529
I don't see anything.

33:45.391 --> 33:46.558
- What happened to John?

33:46.558 --> 33:47.793
- I don't know.

33:47.793 --> 33:48.760
He's just, his leg
was all bloody.

33:48.760 --> 33:49.828
He just limped away.

33:49.828 --> 33:50.662
- Mom.

33:55.801 --> 33:57.103
I want my mommy.

34:03.175 --> 34:04.110
- She's gonna get in here.

34:04.110 --> 34:05.111
- Everyone, close the door.

34:09.115 --> 34:10.982
- Get her off.

34:10.982 --> 34:11.817
Get her off.

34:13.585 --> 34:14.753
- Stop moving.

34:32.171 --> 34:33.004
- Ali.

34:35.107 --> 34:36.608
Hey.

34:36.608 --> 34:39.645
Olivia, there's a
dead woman in your room.

34:39.645 --> 34:40.779
- What?

34:40.779 --> 34:42.013
I don't know.

34:42.013 --> 34:43.749
I just stepped away
for like two minutes.

34:43.749 --> 34:45.016
She must've come in then.

34:46.152 --> 34:48.053
- Okay. Okay.

34:48.053 --> 34:48.987
You need to call the cops, okay?

34:48.987 --> 34:49.788
Don't leave the apartment.

34:49.788 --> 34:51.190
Just lock the door.

34:51.190 --> 34:53.091
There's something
happening in the building.

34:54.025 --> 34:55.627
What do you mean?

34:55.627 --> 34:57.028
- I don't know.

34:57.028 --> 34:58.164
People are going crazy.

34:58.997 --> 35:00.232
What?

35:00.232 --> 35:01.633
- Just lock the door
and call the cops, okay?

35:01.633 --> 35:02.968
Just don't leave.

35:02.968 --> 35:03.802
Okay. Okay.

35:03.802 --> 35:05.371
- Okay. I love you.

35:05.371 --> 35:06.705
I love you too.

35:06.705 --> 35:07.539
- Okay, bye.

35:16.648 --> 35:18.617
- 1306 to dispatch. Do you copy?

35:22.688 --> 35:24.890
1306 to 782.

35:36.602 --> 35:38.237
- I don't think
he's breathing, man.

35:53.485 --> 35:54.320
- Wait.

35:56.488 --> 35:57.323
Hang on.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.161
Stop.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.130
You don't wanna get what he has.

36:05.130 --> 36:05.964
- That's smart.

36:17.976 --> 36:19.711
- He moved. I just saw him move.

36:19.711 --> 36:20.546
- Are you sure?

36:21.747 --> 36:22.581
- Connor.

36:23.482 --> 36:24.683
Connor, wake up.

36:44.870 --> 36:45.771
Connor, calm down.

36:48.707 --> 36:49.508
Connor, stop.

36:51.777 --> 36:53.245
- Lee.

36:53.245 --> 36:54.813
- Stop moving, that's an order.

36:59.918 --> 37:01.086
- Lee, come on.

37:04.923 --> 37:06.224
- I wanna help you.

37:06.224 --> 37:07.759
Will you let me do that?

37:09.094 --> 37:10.195
Connor, stop.

37:10.195 --> 37:14.700
Please.

37:29.781 --> 37:30.616
- Lee.

39:26.998 --> 39:29.034
- Jacqui, can I use this?

39:47.218 --> 39:49.555
- Hey Jack, you got
anything else in there

39:49.555 --> 39:50.689
that could help us out?

40:06.204 --> 40:08.774
Well, this could come in handy.

40:20.351 --> 40:22.053
- They're not picking up.

40:22.053 --> 40:23.288
- What?

40:23.288 --> 40:24.456
- 911, I've called
like five times.

40:24.456 --> 40:26.024
No one's answering.

40:26.024 --> 40:27.559
- Why wouldn't
they be answering?

40:29.895 --> 40:31.463
- There's a bunch of
weird noises outside.

40:31.463 --> 40:32.831
I don't know what's going on.

41:04.630 --> 41:05.531
- Help me with these doors.

41:05.531 --> 41:06.798
- What are you doing?

41:06.798 --> 41:08.266
- That woman over there
was gonna fit in here.

41:08.266 --> 41:09.467
That means I can squeeze out.

41:09.467 --> 41:10.969
- Yeah, or let all of them in.

41:10.969 --> 41:12.504
- We need to talk
about this first.

41:12.504 --> 41:13.471
- There's nothing to talk about.

41:13.471 --> 41:14.906
It's my sister and I'm going.

41:18.577 --> 41:19.410
Please.

41:24.983 --> 41:25.917
- Idiots.

41:25.917 --> 41:28.353
Wait, I'll get that side.

41:29.821 --> 41:31.790
I have a feeling we're
probably gonna need that gun.

41:33.859 --> 41:35.360
- Jacqui.
- Yup.

41:35.360 --> 41:37.028
- Put this in the door
when they get it open.

41:37.028 --> 41:38.363
Okay.

41:40.866 --> 41:41.700
- Ready?

41:42.701 --> 41:44.235
One.

41:44.235 --> 41:45.737
Two.

41:45.737 --> 41:46.538
Three.

41:48.039 --> 41:49.374
- Okay now, Jack.

41:49.374 --> 41:50.241
- I got it.

41:55.513 --> 41:57.048
- Do you hear that?

42:00.485 --> 42:02.888
- I don't hear anything.
- Sh!

42:17.936 --> 42:19.204
Close the door.

42:30.548 --> 42:31.917
That was John, wasn't it?

42:42.060 --> 42:43.128
- She's okay.

42:44.095 --> 42:44.996
She's okay.

42:46.031 --> 42:47.833
- Backup will be
here any minute.

42:47.833 --> 42:49.300
They'll send a whole
squad to get her.

42:49.300 --> 42:51.202
Wait, what,
that's your plan?

42:51.202 --> 42:52.003
Yeah.

42:53.371 --> 42:55.406
- Look, 911 is not
working, there's rioting.

42:55.406 --> 42:56.875
You can't even get
a hold of anybody.

42:56.875 --> 42:59.010
Things are going south, fast.

42:59.010 --> 43:00.011
- They'll be here.

43:00.011 --> 43:00.946
I'm not giving up on them.

43:00.946 --> 43:02.380
- How long are we gonna wait?

43:02.380 --> 43:03.649
Till her sister dies?

43:05.116 --> 43:06.151
Till the power goes out and
we're stuck in here forever?

43:06.151 --> 43:07.352
Look, I'm a big boy.

43:07.352 --> 43:08.586
I ain't squeezing
outta here, all right?

43:08.586 --> 43:09.855
Look, we need a plan.

43:12.390 --> 43:13.224
- Come on, dad.

43:14.592 --> 43:15.426
- Hey, what about you, MacGyver?

43:15.426 --> 43:16.662
What do you got?

43:16.662 --> 43:17.896
You're an engineer
or something, right?

43:17.896 --> 43:20.699
I mean, how would you
get us out of here?

43:20.699 --> 43:22.701
- If I could get up
to the control room,

43:22.701 --> 43:24.569
I could get this
elevator moving.

43:24.569 --> 43:27.572
- I don't like any plan where
you leave this elevator alone.

43:32.510 --> 43:35.146
Hi, this
is Nathan Fields.

43:37.649 --> 43:38.583
- Matthews.

43:38.583 --> 43:39.985
I'm here, we still need help.

43:39.985 --> 43:42.220
Emergency evacuation.

43:42.220 --> 43:43.054
Over...

43:44.155 --> 43:45.023
Fire...

43:45.023 --> 43:46.391
- Matthews repeat.

44:09.614 --> 44:11.182
Okay.

44:11.182 --> 44:13.118
Let's get you up to
that control room.

44:13.118 --> 44:14.720
- Okay, so how are
we gonna do this?

44:17.789 --> 44:18.623
- It's quiet.

44:21.226 --> 44:22.728
Let's get these doors ready.

44:22.728 --> 44:23.561
Come on.

44:25.596 --> 44:27.632
- I'm about to be up there.

44:27.632 --> 44:28.834
Listen, Olivia.

44:28.834 --> 44:29.901
I hear loud noises
getting going.

44:29.901 --> 44:30.802
They're all angry.

44:32.270 --> 44:34.305
- Okay. You need to hold on
for just a few more minutes.

44:34.305 --> 44:35.540
I'm about to be up there.

44:35.540 --> 44:36.775
- Jacqui.
- Yeah.

44:36.775 --> 44:38.209
- Cover us.
- Really?

44:42.480 --> 44:44.049
- Ready?

44:44.049 --> 44:45.316
- Pull.

44:45.316 --> 44:47.118
There's so
many in the hall.

44:47.118 --> 44:49.855
I can't get out of
here and get past them.

44:49.855 --> 44:50.889
- I'm bringing back up.

44:50.889 --> 44:52.623
- Jack, now.
- Good.

44:52.623 --> 44:55.026
- Just sit tight. I'm
gonna see you really soon.

44:57.662 --> 44:59.030
- Liv, give me your phone.

45:01.199 --> 45:04.635
- Okay, I'm gonna bring the
elevator up to the top floor.

45:04.635 --> 45:06.037
We're gonna take
'em out together.

45:06.037 --> 45:08.539
- Look, I know you're
gonna want to move fast,

45:08.539 --> 45:10.441
but you need to be quiet too.

45:10.441 --> 45:11.709
These things are loud.

45:11.709 --> 45:13.879
If you alert one, you
might alert them all.

45:15.280 --> 45:16.181
- Here.

45:16.181 --> 45:16.982
I set it up.

45:19.084 --> 45:21.152
- You guys really
wanna do a video call.

45:21.152 --> 45:22.687
- It's a good idea.

45:22.687 --> 45:24.790
That's the best way for us
to know what's happening.

45:48.780 --> 45:50.548
- Hey, don't screw this up.

45:50.548 --> 45:51.482
- Boost me.

46:01.392 --> 46:02.227
- Wait.

46:05.163 --> 46:05.997
Take this.

46:13.038 --> 46:15.506
You know how to use it?

46:15.506 --> 46:16.808
- Yeah.

46:16.808 --> 46:18.043
- Good.

46:18.043 --> 46:19.744
There's two extra mags
in the front there.

46:21.146 --> 46:21.980
- Thank you.

46:37.295 --> 46:39.597
- Well, here we go.

46:41.532 --> 46:42.733
- So far, so good.

46:42.733 --> 46:43.869
No sign of 'em.

47:02.387 --> 47:04.455
I don't like this,
it's so quiet.

47:06.858 --> 47:08.359
Anything happening down there?

47:11.096 --> 47:11.997
- No, no, nothing.

47:20.505 --> 47:21.339
- What was that?
- Shut up.

47:21.339 --> 47:22.974
She's trying to listen.

47:22.974 --> 47:23.808
- Sorry.

47:36.922 --> 47:38.189
- What is that?

47:48.399 --> 47:49.334
- Olivia, hide.

48:50.761 --> 48:54.032
Okay, I'm
gonna keep moving.

48:55.500 --> 48:58.003
Here, you guys watch
the stairwell below.

48:58.003 --> 49:00.238
I'm gonna keep an eye
out for anything above.

49:05.876 --> 49:07.445
- Well, your shoes look great.

49:07.445 --> 49:09.614
- Sorry. I can't
hold this while...

49:09.614 --> 49:10.648
Ow!

49:10.648 --> 49:11.482
- Olivia?

49:16.121 --> 49:18.523
- This video call idea sucks.

49:19.524 --> 49:20.758
How do I turn that off?

49:28.266 --> 49:30.101
- Olivia, there's
something up there.

49:32.670 --> 49:33.504
- Go back down.

49:48.986 --> 49:50.288
I don't
hear anything.

50:13.878 --> 50:15.580
- Did you mute it?

50:15.580 --> 50:18.849
- No, they were insanely quiet.

50:18.849 --> 50:21.686
Be careful. They're
headed downstairs.

50:27.125 --> 50:28.526
Looks clear to me.

50:28.526 --> 50:30.128
Damn it, not again.

50:37.268 --> 50:38.103
Okay.

51:05.062 --> 51:06.564
- Well, that's it.

51:22.480 --> 51:24.048
- She just needs a few minutes.

51:50.308 --> 51:51.876
One new message.

51:55.346 --> 51:56.214
Jacqui.

52:01.018 --> 52:04.155
Remember that time we
camped by the lake?

52:04.155 --> 52:08.159
You and mom made that
whole bag of marshmallows?

52:12.797 --> 52:15.032
I was so proud of you, Jacqui.

52:23.674 --> 52:26.277
Your mom would be proud of you.

52:30.047 --> 52:34.285
Listen, you've gotta be
strong for me now, okay?

52:34.285 --> 52:35.286
I love you, Jack.

52:50.468 --> 52:51.669
- Are you okay?

53:04.982 --> 53:06.717
- Do you hear that?

53:06.717 --> 53:07.818
What?

53:09.887 --> 53:10.721
- Listen.

53:18.729 --> 53:20.531
- That sounds like a kid.

53:20.531 --> 53:21.366
- Let me look.

53:32.042 --> 53:33.744
It's a little girl.

53:33.744 --> 53:34.579
Hey.

53:36.681 --> 53:41.619
Come on.

53:41.619 --> 53:42.453
I can fit out here.

53:42.453 --> 53:43.288
I have to go get her.

53:43.288 --> 53:44.121
- No, no.

53:45.756 --> 53:47.091
Now let me look.

53:55.400 --> 53:56.834
- It's too dangerous, Jacqui.

53:58.269 --> 54:00.805
- If I don't go out there,
they're gonna get her.

54:00.805 --> 54:02.907
I'm not asking for
your permission.

54:02.907 --> 54:04.141
- We can't protect
you out there.

54:04.141 --> 54:05.843
- I don't need protecting.

54:05.843 --> 54:07.778
- Right. Look, Olivia
had a real gun.

54:07.778 --> 54:09.414
- You're just assuming that
something bad happened to her.

54:09.414 --> 54:11.749
- She said those things are
on their way down here now.

54:11.749 --> 54:13.818
That girl crying is drawing
them in as we speak.

54:13.818 --> 54:16.521
- Which means that I need
to go get her right now.

54:16.521 --> 54:17.588
- No, no. Don't let
her do this, man.

54:17.588 --> 54:18.823
I got a bad feeling.

54:21.526 --> 54:22.893
- Lee, I need to do this.

54:24.094 --> 54:24.929
Please.

54:31.001 --> 54:36.006
Are you guys just gonna sit
here and listen to this kid die?

54:41.178 --> 54:42.780
- Listen to me.

54:42.780 --> 54:44.915
You're gonna do this as quickly
and quietly as possible.

54:46.484 --> 54:48.285
If she resists, you
clamp her mouth shut

54:48.285 --> 54:49.119
and drag her back here.

54:49.119 --> 54:50.321
Don't be gentle.

54:50.321 --> 54:51.822
You're saving your
life, you understand?

54:51.822 --> 54:52.657
- Yeah.

54:53.558 --> 54:54.759
- Mason, boost her.

54:57.528 --> 54:58.429
- Ready?
- Yeah.

55:07.872 --> 55:08.706
- Good luck.

55:19.350 --> 55:20.284
- Hey, little girl.

55:35.032 --> 55:37.535
Hey, hey, are you all right.

55:37.535 --> 55:39.570
- Lee, Lee, get off.

55:39.570 --> 55:40.505
Hold on.

55:40.505 --> 55:42.172
Let me look at Jacqui's phone.

55:42.172 --> 55:44.675
I think that video auto saved.

55:49.113 --> 55:49.914
- Are you okay?

55:52.282 --> 55:53.117
Hey.

55:57.788 --> 55:59.123
Everything's gonna be okay.

56:02.226 --> 56:03.661
Shit, man. Look, right there.

56:05.195 --> 56:06.697
- Jacqui.

56:06.697 --> 56:07.865
Jacqui, don't.

56:12.903 --> 56:14.705
Olivia, is that you?

56:14.705 --> 56:16.707
Take us back down.
Jacqui's not in here.

56:48.038 --> 56:48.973
- Jack, come on.

57:19.336 --> 57:20.170
- Get Jacqui.

57:30.481 --> 57:31.315
- Come on, Jack.

57:35.886 --> 57:37.588
- Let's go. Come on.
- Stay back.

57:52.036 --> 57:54.939
Okay, you saw what happened
to John after he was bit.

57:54.939 --> 57:57.107
He turned fast, I'll
try to kill you.

58:02.847 --> 58:03.914
- We're not leaving without you.

58:03.914 --> 58:05.449
- No. Okay?

58:05.449 --> 58:07.818
No one else is gonna
die because of me.

58:13.257 --> 58:14.458
- Mason, grab her.

58:15.893 --> 58:17.361
- What?

58:17.361 --> 58:18.596
Put me down.

58:18.596 --> 58:19.730
Do you wanna be the
one that has to do it?

58:19.730 --> 58:20.731
Put me down.

58:28.939 --> 58:29.774
- Come on!

58:58.603 --> 59:00.437
I shouldn't have
let you do that.

59:00.437 --> 59:02.006
- You didn't know.
Lee. You didn't know.

59:02.006 --> 59:05.142
Okay, so we had to
do, okay, so we...

59:24.394 --> 59:26.496
When's mom gonna be back?

59:44.281 --> 59:46.383
Okay, I got it, I got it.

59:52.790 --> 59:53.624
- Well?

59:54.792 --> 59:56.727
- There's three of them
down there at the end.

59:56.727 --> 59:57.662
Pounding on the door.

59:57.662 --> 59:58.863
It's gotta be a stair well.

59:58.863 --> 59:59.697
- Three?

1:00:00.865 --> 1:00:04.001
I guess those came
down to get us.

1:00:04.001 --> 1:00:06.403
- Yeah, well, if we
take them by surprise,

1:00:06.403 --> 1:00:08.305
I think we've got this.

1:00:11.809 --> 1:00:12.643
- Guys.

1:00:30.695 --> 1:00:31.528
- Ali.

1:00:32.997 --> 1:00:33.831
Come on.

1:00:35.165 --> 1:00:36.233
Ali.

1:00:36.233 --> 1:00:37.067
Open up.

1:00:40.738 --> 1:00:41.538
- Oh shit!

1:00:59.656 --> 1:01:01.291
- Get down, get down.

1:01:17.674 --> 1:01:18.508
Here.

1:01:22.146 --> 1:01:23.313
- Where's the other mag?

1:01:23.313 --> 1:01:24.581
- Come on.

1:01:24.581 --> 1:01:25.983
Grabbed the belt,
I had to ditch it.

1:01:25.983 --> 1:01:26.817
I'm sorry.

1:01:30.420 --> 1:01:31.756
- Olivia, hurry.

1:01:36.426 --> 1:01:37.728
- Ali.

1:02:19.136 --> 1:02:19.970
Ali.

1:02:31.715 --> 1:02:32.549
No.

1:02:34.985 --> 1:02:35.820
No.

1:02:41.358 --> 1:02:42.192
Lee.

1:02:43.160 --> 1:02:43.994
- Olivia.

1:02:59.877 --> 1:03:00.610
- Jacqui.

1:03:23.500 --> 1:03:24.701
Come on, kid.

1:03:24.701 --> 1:03:26.703
Your dad wants to
play one of his games.

1:04:46.917 --> 1:04:48.285
- Jack.

1:04:48.285 --> 1:04:49.119
Jack.

1:04:51.855 --> 1:04:52.689
Jack.

1:06:15.972 --> 1:06:16.806
- Olivia.

1:06:20.177 --> 1:06:21.011
Olivia.

1:06:21.011 --> 1:06:21.845
- No.

1:06:22.879 --> 1:06:24.048
- Olivia.
- No.

1:07:11.395 --> 1:07:12.229
- Jacqui.

1:07:19.869 --> 1:07:23.173
- When I do this, you're
gonna shut the door behind me.

1:07:23.173 --> 1:07:24.007
- What?

1:07:27.477 --> 1:07:30.147
- Take care of each other, okay?

1:07:32.516 --> 1:07:34.584
Look after Olivia for me.

1:08:05.982 --> 1:08:07.651
- Come on, man.

1:08:07.651 --> 1:08:08.885
We've got maybe a
couple of minutes

1:08:08.885 --> 1:08:11.488
before they break
that thing down.

1:08:34.478 --> 1:08:36.146
So what's your plan?

1:08:37.381 --> 1:08:38.615
- I don't know.

1:08:40.250 --> 1:08:41.084
- Jacqui?

1:09:03.240 --> 1:09:04.408
- There's a ledge out here.

1:09:04.408 --> 1:09:05.509
We can make it across
the other unit.

1:09:07.110 --> 1:09:07.944
Let's go.

1:09:09.479 --> 1:09:10.314
- Pack that up.

1:09:11.681 --> 1:09:12.516
- Yeah.

1:09:18.888 --> 1:09:19.723
- Olivia.

1:09:21.090 --> 1:09:21.925
I'm sorry,

1:09:24.093 --> 1:09:25.762
but we have to keep moving.

1:09:27.564 --> 1:09:29.233
- I'm not going anywhere.

1:09:29.233 --> 1:09:30.334
I'm staying with her.

1:09:42.779 --> 1:09:44.481
- Set the timer
for three minutes.

1:09:45.882 --> 1:09:48.585
If we're not over there
by then, we're dead.

1:09:48.585 --> 1:09:49.753
Leave without us.

1:09:49.753 --> 1:09:50.687
- What are you
talking about, man?

1:09:50.687 --> 1:09:51.955
- There's no time. Just go.

1:09:51.955 --> 1:09:53.590
- Lee, man. She
doesn't wanna go.

1:09:54.858 --> 1:09:55.692
- I know.

1:09:57.193 --> 1:09:58.595
- Look, if you stay here-

1:09:58.595 --> 1:10:00.697
- I know. I got this.

1:10:00.697 --> 1:10:01.598
Just go, Mason.

1:10:09.239 --> 1:10:10.073
Hey.

1:10:12.276 --> 1:10:13.377
Take care of yourself.

1:10:17.547 --> 1:10:22.552
- I always do.

1:10:29.025 --> 1:10:30.727
- What are you doing?

1:10:30.727 --> 1:10:31.595
Get out.

1:10:34.764 --> 1:10:36.232
- I don't leave until you do.

1:10:39.536 --> 1:10:40.704
- Then you're gonna die.

1:12:59.876 --> 1:13:00.610
- Lee.

1:13:39.583 --> 1:13:41.751
You're still here?

1:13:44.854 --> 1:13:48.024
- You haven't quite
got rid of me yet.

1:13:54.130 --> 1:13:55.398
Let's get the hell outta here.

1:14:01.337 --> 1:14:03.773
- There's stairwells
to the left.

1:14:03.773 --> 1:14:05.108
Let's try for that.

1:14:11.581 --> 1:14:12.415
Back.
