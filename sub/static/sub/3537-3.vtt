WEBVTT

00:00.468 --> 00:03.936
In a brutal slaying that
occurred on a downtown subway.

00:04.337 --> 00:05.838
It was rather
alarming hearing

00:05.840 --> 00:07.339
About the murders
in new york.

00:07.341 --> 00:08.574
You ain't getting itchy?

00:08.576 --> 00:09.441
All of that
is behind me.

00:09.443 --> 00:11.443
You're withholding
information that you
obtained illegally.

00:11.445 --> 00:12.911
You've got to stop
playing dirty harry

00:12.913 --> 00:13.879
And go to the fbi, ryan.

00:13.881 --> 00:14.847
They're your people.

00:17.050 --> 00:18.083
Of carroll
in the past year?

00:18.085 --> 00:18.717
No.

00:18.719 --> 00:19.551
Where is joe carroll?

00:19.553 --> 00:21.453
I haven't seen joe
since the lighthouse.

00:21.455 --> 00:22.388
-Hello?
-Carlos?

00:22.390 --> 00:23.322
Emma, are you
with joe?

00:23.324 --> 00:24.590
Joe's dead.
Where are you?

00:24.592 --> 00:25.624
Who are you with?

00:25.626 --> 00:27.926
Ryan: You're looking
for brothers,
identical twins.

00:27.928 --> 00:29.595
Luke: I bet claire's
death hurt.

00:29.597 --> 00:31.597
It's nice to see you
getting back out there again.

00:31.599 --> 00:33.332
You really have a thing
for blonds.

00:33.334 --> 00:35.634
You're an interesting
man, ryan.

00:35.636 --> 00:37.136
I'll have you home
before you know it.

00:37.138 --> 00:40.072
Aah! He was
in the subway!

00:40.074 --> 00:42.074
Run! Aah!

00:42.076 --> 00:43.642
Unh!

00:45.546 --> 00:48.480
Ryan: I took risks
with your safety.

00:48.482 --> 00:50.582
You saved my life.

00:50.584 --> 00:52.818
What are we watching?

00:52.820 --> 00:54.186
Mandy: He knows.

00:54.188 --> 00:55.788
Aah!

00:55.790 --> 00:57.956
Mandy: Mama's gonna
be home soon.

00:57.958 --> 01:00.592
She's gonna be mad.

01:08.568 --> 01:11.637
Mama's gonna be home
soon, joe.

01:11.639 --> 01:13.272
What are we gonna do?

01:13.274 --> 01:14.606
We can start
by hiding the body, huh?

01:14.608 --> 01:17.543
If we untie him,
we could roll him up
in the carpet

01:17.545 --> 01:20.679
And drag him
to the barn.

01:20.681 --> 01:23.682
Well, you are fast
on your feet.

01:23.684 --> 01:24.716
Judy: I'm home!

01:24.718 --> 01:27.519
What is the reverend's
car doing in the driveway

01:27.521 --> 01:29.955
With the window
smashed out?

01:29.957 --> 01:31.390
[gasps]

01:31.392 --> 01:35.294
It's not what it
looks like, mama.

01:35.296 --> 01:36.495
Actually, mandy,
it's--

01:36.497 --> 01:39.598
It's exactly
what it looks like.

01:47.941 --> 01:51.009
[footsteps,
floorboards creaking]

02:34.487 --> 02:36.722
Hello, ryan.

02:39.659 --> 02:42.694
You can't
kill me, ryan.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.563
Aaigh!

02:47.033 --> 02:50.269
If I die--
heh heh heh--

02:50.271 --> 02:51.603
You die.

02:51.605 --> 02:53.539
Unh!

02:58.311 --> 02:59.878
Ohh!

02:59.880 --> 03:02.014
[exhales]

03:15.662 --> 03:18.230
Mike: Hey, ryan.

03:18.232 --> 03:20.165
We're ready
for you.

03:20.167 --> 03:21.767
Oh, yeah.

03:24.571 --> 03:25.904
[indistinct chatter]

03:25.906 --> 03:27.139
Mendez: Sorry to keep
you waiting.

03:27.141 --> 03:28.607
It's been a long night
for all of us.

03:28.609 --> 03:29.675
Can I get
a coffee, please?

03:29.677 --> 03:31.443
Sure. Get him a coffee.
We got the footage

03:31.445 --> 03:33.145
From last night's benefit.

03:33.147 --> 03:33.645
Mike.

03:33.647 --> 03:35.380
You went in through
the main door.

03:35.382 --> 03:36.748
You have him
on the phone.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.984
I see him there
in the corner.

03:38.986 --> 03:41.987
And that's his twin
standing behind you.

03:41.989 --> 03:44.823
Let's get
their faces out
to the public.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.825
Uh, run it
by phillips.

03:46.827 --> 03:47.659
He's briefing
the mayor.

03:47.661 --> 03:50.796
He'll want to
issue a statement.

03:55.668 --> 03:59.838
Don't overidentify
with the victim,
mr. Hardy.

03:59.840 --> 04:00.806
Excuse me?

04:00.808 --> 04:01.673
I know you care
about her,

04:01.675 --> 04:03.842
But you almost got
that woman killed.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.110
Try to resist.

04:05.112 --> 04:06.545
Here's your
phone back.

04:06.547 --> 04:07.246
Anything?

04:07.248 --> 04:09.648
We found a disposable
phone in a trashcan

04:09.650 --> 04:10.649
4 blocks
from the museum.

04:10.651 --> 04:11.984
Yeah. Well, they're
using burner phones.

04:11.986 --> 04:13.986
They're swapping
them out daily so
they can't be traced.

04:13.988 --> 04:15.020
Well, thank you,
ryan.

04:15.022 --> 04:16.788
We hadn't thought
of that,

04:16.790 --> 04:18.357
But did manage to
create a video trail

04:18.358 --> 04:19.958
Using surveillance
footage

04:19.959 --> 04:21.459
After the subway
massacre.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.795
We followed the 3 suspects
from the station.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.230
The twins outmaneuvered
the cameras,

04:25.232 --> 04:27.566
But carlos led us
47 blocks to his apartment

04:27.568 --> 04:29.868
On avenue d.

04:29.870 --> 04:32.604
[horn honks,
tires squeals]

04:34.774 --> 04:37.109
That must have hurt.

04:37.877 --> 04:40.212
We found your prints
all over the apartment.

04:40.214 --> 04:41.713
Kind of have to
cooperate now,

04:41.715 --> 04:44.249
So why don't you start?

04:44.251 --> 04:46.585
Ok. Truth--

04:46.587 --> 04:48.353
I went looking for carlos,
I found him,

04:48.355 --> 04:50.822
He got away, I chased him,
taxi, splat.

04:50.824 --> 04:51.857
What did you take
form the apartment?

04:51.859 --> 04:53.825
Don't like because
we have the footage.

04:53.827 --> 04:56.595
Duffel bag with some
clothes, toiletries,

04:56.597 --> 04:57.496
A joe carroll mask.

04:57.498 --> 04:58.830
I'll turn it all
in to you.

04:58.832 --> 05:02.234
Obstruction, vigilantism,
contaminating a crime scene,

05:02.236 --> 05:03.769
Tampering with evidence.

05:03.771 --> 05:06.405
Are you arresting me?

05:06.407 --> 05:11.843
No. I'm not.
You're free to go.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.850
Thanks for the coffee.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.852
No problem.

05:25.124 --> 05:27.392
You got a signal
on hardy?

05:27.394 --> 05:28.260
Got him.

05:28.262 --> 05:30.062
He knows you got
a court order and
you're tracking him.

05:30.064 --> 05:34.232
Good. Monitor his
online activity, as well.

05:34.234 --> 05:36.134
[luke groans]

05:36.136 --> 05:37.736
Am I gonna live?

05:41.874 --> 05:45.243
No way. I want to feel
every second of it.

05:45.245 --> 05:46.478
Never been shot before.

05:46.480 --> 05:49.815
Ugh. You've
been grazed.

05:49.817 --> 05:50.716
It counts.

05:50.718 --> 05:51.983
There's a hole
in my shoulder.

05:51.985 --> 05:56.555
It's an official
ryan hardy gunshot wound.

05:56.557 --> 05:57.255
Hell, yeah.

05:57.257 --> 05:59.958
Man on tv: Killer twins.
That's the breaking news

05:59.960 --> 06:01.259
Today as photo images
have been released

06:01.261 --> 06:02.928
Of two additional suspects

06:02.930 --> 06:04.096
In connection
with the series of murders

06:04.098 --> 06:06.231
Terrorizing the city
of new york.

06:06.233 --> 06:07.833
You guys have
been made.

06:07.835 --> 06:08.900
It was inevitable,

06:08.902 --> 06:10.969
But they won't
identify us.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.637
[cell phone ringing]

06:12.639 --> 06:14.139
Man: ...A charity gala
at the stewart russian museum,

06:14.141 --> 06:15.974
Where they brutally stabbed
a male guest.

06:15.976 --> 06:18.810
That victim remains
in the hospital at this hour.

06:18.812 --> 06:21.279
It's emma.
She keeps calling.

06:21.281 --> 06:22.581
Send it
to voicemail.

06:22.583 --> 06:25.150
Take a hint, bitch.

06:27.487 --> 06:28.787
Why don't you
like emma?

06:28.789 --> 06:31.022
Uh, because she's
unlikable.

06:31.024 --> 06:31.957
No one liked her.

06:31.959 --> 06:33.925
It says here she was one
of his first followers.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.261
He trusted her
with his son.
That's huge.

06:36.263 --> 06:38.930
A lot of good
that did.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.268
Call her back.

06:43.270 --> 06:44.803
What?

06:45.405 --> 06:47.105
Mark, what are you
doing?

06:47.107 --> 06:49.441
Having a little fun.

06:49.443 --> 06:50.642
It's not hurting anything,

06:50.644 --> 06:54.179
And it's not like
joe's calling.

06:54.181 --> 06:55.714
Go ahead. Call her.

06:55.716 --> 06:57.816
And say what?

07:06.759 --> 07:10.295
Hannah: If joe
were alive,
we would know.

07:11.798 --> 07:12.964
Would we?

07:12.966 --> 07:14.299
You would.

07:14.301 --> 07:16.201
He would have
contacted you.

07:16.203 --> 07:19.171
You two were tight.

07:19.173 --> 07:21.206
Maybe there was a reason
that he couldn't.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.708
[cell phone ringing]

07:23.710 --> 07:24.743
Hello?

07:24.745 --> 07:25.644
Carlos: It's me.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.746
I've been calling you.
Why did you hang up on me?

07:27.748 --> 07:29.481
Yeah, um, sorry
about that.

07:29.483 --> 07:32.317
What are you doing?
Who are you with?

07:32.319 --> 07:34.052
Why did you ask
about joe?

07:34.054 --> 07:36.054
Look. I can't talk
about it over the phone.

07:36.056 --> 07:36.922
Is joe alive?

07:36.924 --> 07:38.990
Not over the phone.
Meet me in person,

07:38.992 --> 07:40.892
And I'll explain
everything.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.260
Just come alone.

07:42.262 --> 07:43.562
Get a pen and some paper.

07:43.564 --> 07:45.664
I'll give you directions.

07:50.903 --> 07:54.639
Don't worry. I'll--
I'll be careful.

07:56.442 --> 07:57.609
[knock on door]

07:57.611 --> 08:00.412
Miss gray? Ryan hardy
is here to see you.

08:00.414 --> 08:02.948
Please let him in.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.349
We're just downstairs.

08:04.351 --> 08:06.084
Thank you.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.719
It's good
to see you.

08:07.721 --> 08:08.687
How's david?

08:08.689 --> 08:10.055
David's in good spirits.

08:10.057 --> 08:11.923
I was with him
all morning
at the hospital.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.925
They'll release him
tomorrow.

08:13.927 --> 08:16.061
I'm so sorry
for everything.

08:16.063 --> 08:18.029
You keep apologizing.

08:18.031 --> 08:19.798
It's not your fault.

08:19.800 --> 08:23.201
Yeah, it is.

08:23.203 --> 08:25.470
Will the fbi find them?

08:25.472 --> 08:26.371
Eventually.

08:26.373 --> 08:28.874
These are very smart,
organized people.

08:28.876 --> 08:32.143
As insane as they are,
joe carroll's groupies are

08:32.145 --> 08:33.912
Beyond resourceful.

08:33.914 --> 08:38.817
But when they find them,
there will be more.

08:38.818 --> 08:42.120
This is what's become
of our society,

08:42.121 --> 08:45.056
This obsession
with violence,

08:45.058 --> 08:50.262
The need to express it
in its purest form.

08:50.264 --> 08:53.031
I much prefer it in art.

08:55.167 --> 08:58.403
Well, yeah, I just
came by to check on you,

08:58.405 --> 09:01.139
So I should probably
be going.

09:01.141 --> 09:03.141
Will you come back,

09:03.143 --> 09:04.943
Check in
on me again?

09:04.945 --> 09:07.379
Yeah, sure, if you want.

09:08.347 --> 09:12.083
I'm getting used to
having you around.

09:16.656 --> 09:19.324
Judy: The reverend
was a good man.

09:19.326 --> 09:21.760
Mama, he recognized joe
from tv.

09:21.762 --> 09:22.994
We had to do something.

09:22.996 --> 09:25.630
I understand that,

09:25.632 --> 09:27.999
But you didn't have
to kill him.

09:28.001 --> 09:31.136
I don't think you're
seeing the bigger
picture, judy.

09:31.138 --> 09:34.606
I'm sorry.
You killed reverend glen.

09:34.608 --> 09:36.007
What part did I miss?

09:36.009 --> 09:38.543
Would you rather
call the police,

09:38.545 --> 09:40.178
Tell them that
you've been
harboring

09:40.180 --> 09:42.948
A serial killer
for the best part
of a year?

09:42.950 --> 09:44.683
What do you think
they're gonna say
when they learn

09:44.685 --> 09:46.151
That you and I
were pen pals

09:46.153 --> 09:47.719
When I was
in prison?

09:47.721 --> 09:49.621
I was never part
of your cult.

09:49.623 --> 09:52.958
You did write
letters declaring
your love me, yeah,

09:52.960 --> 09:56.828
Saying you could--
you could fix me?

09:56.830 --> 09:59.164
So I came here
for you.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.132
And I did fix you!

10:01.134 --> 10:03.201
For a year.

10:03.203 --> 10:04.502
You were doing so well.

10:04.504 --> 10:07.839
I know, judy.
I know,

10:07.841 --> 10:12.210
But I finally
realized that

10:12.212 --> 10:15.680
Once an alcoholic,
always an alcoholic,

10:15.682 --> 10:17.349
And to live one's
entire life

10:17.351 --> 10:21.152
Without having
a scotch or two
is really...

10:21.154 --> 10:24.022
Not a life
worth living.

10:24.957 --> 10:27.058
What are you gonna do?

10:27.060 --> 10:29.761
Well, come
nightfall, I am
gonna say good-bye

10:29.763 --> 10:32.430
To this little
slice of heaven,

10:32.432 --> 10:35.233
And I am
gonna leave.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.068
Please, joe. Don't.

10:37.070 --> 10:39.604
We can bury
the reverend.

10:39.606 --> 10:42.540
Things can go back
how they were before.

10:42.542 --> 10:44.442
What's gonna happen to us?

10:44.444 --> 10:47.078
Well, if
you're smart,

10:47.080 --> 10:49.180
You'll say nothing.

10:49.182 --> 10:54.786
I would hate it
if anything bad

10:54.788 --> 10:58.556
Were to happen to
either one of you.

11:03.763 --> 11:05.163
[ding]

11:07.700 --> 11:09.668
[creak]

11:42.668 --> 11:44.502
What the hell are you
doing here?

11:44.504 --> 11:45.670
No, ryan.

11:45.672 --> 11:49.274
What the hell are
you doing here?

11:57.149 --> 12:00.151
You pulled your life
together.

12:00.153 --> 12:02.821
You're sober,
healthy.

12:02.823 --> 12:03.655
It was all a lie.

12:03.657 --> 12:05.457
No. It's not
all a lie.

12:05.459 --> 12:07.325
No! This is a lie,

12:07.327 --> 12:08.660
And I hate that I
was right about it,

12:08.662 --> 12:10.462
But you have been
hunting joe's
followers.

12:10.464 --> 12:11.629
You found carlos.

12:11.631 --> 12:14.032
What else do
you know?

12:14.034 --> 12:17.135
And this about joe?

12:17.137 --> 12:19.838
You need to start
talking, ryan.

12:23.609 --> 12:26.344
We know your niece
is involved.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.613
No. Not anymore.
She's clean.

12:28.615 --> 12:31.149
Mike, do not go
after her.

12:31.151 --> 12:32.217
Then you need to
talk to me.

12:32.219 --> 12:33.651
Why do you think
joe is still alive?

12:33.653 --> 12:35.320
Doesn't matter.
You're not gonna
believe me anyway.

12:35.322 --> 12:36.788
I have no proof.
It's just a theory.

12:36.790 --> 12:38.890
It's--it's a lunatic's
conspiracy theory.

12:38.892 --> 12:41.159
All right.
Let me decide that.

12:41.161 --> 12:42.360
When I was doing
research on joe,

12:42.362 --> 12:43.962
I went to England,
I visited the town

12:43.964 --> 12:45.230
That he grew up in,
I talked to the--

12:45.232 --> 12:46.831
Yeah. I read your book.
I know this.

12:46.833 --> 12:48.133
His family's all dead.

12:48.135 --> 12:51.202
I sat in a pub,
mostly I drank,

12:51.204 --> 12:54.172
But I did learn
that his father was
a very promiscuous man,

12:54.174 --> 12:58.209
And there was gossip
that a child was
born from it.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.211
And this child was...

13:00.213 --> 13:03.248
William halston.

13:03.250 --> 13:04.883
Went missing
14 months ago.

13:04.885 --> 13:07.218
I can even place
two of roderick's
militia men

13:07.220 --> 13:08.186
In the same city

13:08.188 --> 13:10.688
At the time when
his disappearance
was first noticed.

13:10.690 --> 13:12.323
And you think
halston's body is
what we found

13:12.325 --> 13:13.558
In the ashes and joe
disappeared somehow?

13:13.560 --> 13:17.061
Same height,
same weight,
same body type.

13:17.063 --> 13:18.329
Plus his
y chromosome

13:18.331 --> 13:19.998
Would be a match
to joey's dna.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.700
Ryan, I personally
pulled the physical dna
from the archive.

13:22.702 --> 13:25.170
The dna that convicted joe,
that put him away,

13:25.172 --> 13:26.404
I tested it myself.

13:26.406 --> 13:27.539
The dna was
in an archive warehouse

13:27.541 --> 13:30.341
In beacon that
was broken into
14 months ago.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.177
Oh, and you think
the dna got switched out.

13:32.179 --> 13:33.244
Look. I know mistakes
were made.

13:33.246 --> 13:36.414
We underestimated that cult
at every single turn,
but what you're suggesting

13:36.416 --> 13:38.783
Would require a level
of detail that I don't
think is possible.

13:38.785 --> 13:40.385
It would need to be
a close match in case

13:40.387 --> 13:43.121
They tested it
against his son's dna,

13:43.123 --> 13:45.223
Which you did.

13:45.225 --> 13:48.593
I know. It's crazy.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.929
So am I.

13:59.705 --> 14:02.540
You have earned
your crazy, ryan.

14:02.542 --> 14:05.577
This is about
something else.

14:05.579 --> 14:08.213
We can't change
what's happened.

14:08.215 --> 14:12.317
What's done is done.

14:12.319 --> 14:15.453
Claire's dead.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.722
Debra's dead,

14:17.724 --> 14:22.927
And so is
joe carroll.

14:22.929 --> 14:25.530
[cell phone ringing]

14:28.033 --> 14:30.401
Weston.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.070
Yeah. I'm on my way.

14:32.072 --> 14:32.971
I got to go.

14:32.973 --> 14:34.105
What--what is it?

14:34.107 --> 14:36.107
Hey. Come on.
I told you what I know.

14:36.109 --> 14:37.408
We found something
on emma hill.

14:37.410 --> 14:40.745
If it proves anything,
I will let you know.

14:40.747 --> 14:42.580
And I'm not gonna tell
mendez about this.

14:42.582 --> 14:44.182
She will lock you up.

14:44.184 --> 14:45.750
I'm taking carlos' bag,

14:45.752 --> 14:47.952
But, ryan, I need to
be able to trust you

14:47.954 --> 14:50.889
From this second forward.

16:01.327 --> 16:04.162
Whoa, whoa, stop!
What are you doing?

16:04.164 --> 16:05.697
That is--that is
no way to say hi.

16:05.699 --> 16:06.531
Where's carlos?

16:06.533 --> 16:08.499
He didn't come.
It's just me.

16:08.501 --> 16:10.335
Who are you?

16:10.337 --> 16:11.436
Don't you recognize me?

16:11.438 --> 16:12.570
My face is all over
the news.

16:12.572 --> 16:13.671
Yes, and you have
a twin brother,

16:13.673 --> 16:15.573
But that doesn't
answer my question.

16:15.575 --> 16:19.243
My name's mark, emma,

16:19.245 --> 16:22.580
And it's really nice
to meet you.

16:25.751 --> 16:26.718
What do you got?

16:26.720 --> 16:28.953
We pulled all the footage
from carlos perez's
apartment building.

16:28.955 --> 16:29.587
Hopkins here
found something.

16:29.589 --> 16:30.421
What is it?

16:30.423 --> 16:33.558
We got this footage
from a pizza place
across the street.

16:33.560 --> 16:36.861
The girl
in the hoodie.

16:36.863 --> 16:37.729
That's emma hill.

16:37.731 --> 16:39.530
Yeah, and that's
not all. Lawrence.

16:39.532 --> 16:40.932
We tracked her
to a train stop.

16:40.934 --> 16:43.201
She went
to jersey.

16:43.203 --> 16:44.435
Got off in
burlington,

16:44.437 --> 16:45.603
And, hopkins,
your turn.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.638
I pick her up
on the fourth block
of petrie and bower.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.540
Wait a second.
Is she entering
that residence?

16:49.542 --> 16:50.708
We just got an address.

16:50.710 --> 16:51.943
Listen. I need
air transport,

16:51.945 --> 16:55.947
Atf, swat,
state police now.

16:55.949 --> 17:00.284
I don't want to
be here without you.

17:00.286 --> 17:02.587
Please don't go.

17:06.058 --> 17:08.826
Sweet pea, I have to go.

17:08.828 --> 17:12.896
It's just I never
knew my dad.

17:12.898 --> 17:17.402
He was some guy my
mama hooked up with.

17:17.404 --> 17:22.140
There's been no one
but you.

17:24.977 --> 17:32.483
You know, I am never
gonna forget you, my love.

17:32.485 --> 17:34.385
Judy: Mandy!

17:35.387 --> 17:38.556
You'll let me and joe
have a word?

17:52.738 --> 17:55.706
So where are you
gonna go?

17:55.708 --> 17:57.308
Not really sure.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.477
Probably best
not to know that.

17:59.479 --> 18:03.781
And if the police
do come sniffing?

18:03.783 --> 18:05.616
Heh heh.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.822
[clicking]

18:15.527 --> 18:17.361
It's empty.

18:17.363 --> 18:19.397

the bullets out.

18:19.399 --> 18:21.499
Really?
You're gonna...

18:21.501 --> 18:23.634
You're gonna try
and kill me?

18:23.636 --> 18:25.002
Before you kill us.

18:25.004 --> 18:28.072
Oh. Aren't you
the smart one, huh?

18:28.074 --> 18:29.240
Aah!

Aah! Aah!

18:33.813 --> 18:36.848
Sadly, judy, I am no
longer in need

18:36.850 --> 18:38.516
Of your utopian
slut palace,

18:38.518 --> 18:45.022
But I think you
for your hospitality
all the same.

18:45.024 --> 18:45.523
[choking]

18:45.525 --> 18:50.428
Mandy: No, joe!
Don't! Joe!

18:50.430 --> 18:52.330
Please.

18:52.332 --> 18:54.932
Please.

18:54.934 --> 18:57.735
[gasping]

18:59.771 --> 19:01.873
Ohh! Aah!

19:02.908 --> 19:04.709
It's ok.

19:07.679 --> 19:08.779
Is joe alive?

19:08.781 --> 19:10.715
According to carlos.

19:10.717 --> 19:12.717
He's actually
seen him?

19:12.719 --> 19:14.085
Yes. So he says.

19:14.087 --> 19:16.454
My--my brother
believes him.

19:16.456 --> 19:19.790
He also said
roderick had plans
to switch joe's dna

19:19.792 --> 19:22.994
So they could
fake his death.

19:24.997 --> 19:28.065
You look angry.

19:28.067 --> 19:29.800
No.

19:29.802 --> 19:32.637
It's just...

19:32.639 --> 19:36.240
Why didn't joe
tell me any of this?

19:36.242 --> 19:38.910
I'm sure he had
his reasons.

19:38.912 --> 19:42.947
Everyone has
their reasons.

19:42.949 --> 19:44.615
So you planned
these murders to try

19:44.617 --> 19:46.217
To lure joe out
of hiding?

19:46.219 --> 19:47.251
That's the idea.

19:47.253 --> 19:49.086
What makes you
think he'll call?

19:49.088 --> 19:51.222
The man's a narcissist.

19:51.224 --> 19:53.624
It's not a judgment.
It's a fact.

19:53.626 --> 19:55.893
I don't think
he can resist.

19:55.895 --> 20:00.798
He'll be too curious.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.600
You called.

20:03.969 --> 20:07.438
How many of joe's followers
live with you?

20:10.309 --> 20:11.676
There are 7 of us.

20:11.678 --> 20:13.244
You're lucky.
They've pretty much

20:13.246 --> 20:16.647
Rounded up
everyone else.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.516
How many are
with you?

20:18.518 --> 20:19.917
You want to find out?

20:19.919 --> 20:22.019
I could take you
to them.

20:22.021 --> 20:24.088
Why would I go
with you?

20:24.090 --> 20:28.092
Because we're gonna
find joe.

20:28.094 --> 20:32.263
Come on. You want to come?
I know you do.

20:33.098 --> 20:34.365
Have you read
the book, yet,

20:34.367 --> 20:38.169
"the havenport tragedy"?

20:38.171 --> 20:38.736
Maybe.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.171
Well, in the book,
you're portrayed

20:40.173 --> 20:44.208
As a risk taker
and impulsive,

20:44.210 --> 20:47.345
So--so do it,
take a risk.

20:56.888 --> 21:01.525
Should I be afraid?

21:01.527 --> 21:03.961
Do you feel fear?

21:03.963 --> 21:05.863
I--I struggle with it.

21:05.865 --> 21:06.664
I can identify it
in others,

21:06.666 --> 21:13.604
But I have a hard time
experiencing it myself.

21:16.875 --> 21:22.513
Ok. I'll go
with you.

Is that hannah?

You can't be here.
I said I'd call.

23:12.759 --> 23:13.824
What about emma?
Did you get her?

23:13.826 --> 23:15.025
What about the twins?

23:15.027 --> 23:16.794
Got everybody
but emma and carlos

23:16.796 --> 23:17.528
And the twins.

23:17.530 --> 23:19.864
Enough. Mr. Hardy,
do you know anything
about this place?

23:19.866 --> 23:20.664
Nope.

23:20.666 --> 23:22.032
Well, then you're
of no use to us,

23:22.034 --> 23:23.834
-And I insist you leave.
-You got it.

23:23.836 --> 23:25.636
As a matter of fact,
from this moment forward,

23:25.638 --> 23:28.172
This entire investigation
is off limits.

23:28.174 --> 23:30.107
That includes lily gray.

23:30.109 --> 23:32.109
You understand me?

23:32.111 --> 23:32.943
All right.

23:32.945 --> 23:36.313
I will arrest you.

23:36.315 --> 23:38.682
Get out of here.

23:54.633 --> 23:56.867
We both know you're
not supposed to be here,

23:56.869 --> 23:59.370
So turn yourself around.

23:59.372 --> 24:01.338
-Hi.
-Hi.

to send mr. Hardy away.

The fbi raided
a follower safe house,

Killed 5 people
and arrested a sixth.

24:17.156 --> 24:20.191
Oh, my god.
Did they get all of them?

24:20.193 --> 24:22.259
They were from
the havenport cult.

24:22.261 --> 24:26.997
The ones from the subway
are still out there.

24:26.999 --> 24:28.098
Oh. Wow.

24:28.100 --> 24:31.001
Hey, listen. I came by
to tell you that

24:31.003 --> 24:33.337
I have to say good-bye
for now.

24:33.339 --> 24:33.904
Why?

24:33.906 --> 24:35.506
I can't be a part
of this anymore.

24:35.508 --> 24:39.477
It's for
your own safety.

24:39.978 --> 24:44.748
Because people you
care about get hurt.

24:44.750 --> 24:50.221
I didn't know
about joe's wife claire.

24:50.223 --> 24:52.389
We move on.

24:52.391 --> 24:56.727
Yeah. We must move on.

24:56.729 --> 24:58.729
Have you?

25:00.265 --> 25:03.901
To tell you the truth,
I'm not sure.

25:03.903 --> 25:06.871
After claire died,

25:06.873 --> 25:10.107
I, uh, lost my mind.

25:10.109 --> 25:11.408
I was living
in the bottle,

25:11.410 --> 25:13.110
My health went south.

25:13.112 --> 25:15.946
I did things--

25:15.948 --> 25:18.148
I did a lot of things
to distract

25:18.150 --> 25:20.584
From the guilt.

25:20.586 --> 25:23.454
That's understandable.

25:24.322 --> 25:27.658
Do you believe things
happen for a reason?

25:27.660 --> 25:34.164
Ehnn. Um, I'm not
so big on fate.

25:34.166 --> 25:36.300
Me neither.

25:36.302 --> 25:39.803
You know, I believe
that our decisions

25:39.805 --> 25:41.805
And our mistakes
define us,

25:41.807 --> 25:46.243
But lately I don't know.

25:47.579 --> 25:52.116
You know...Why was I
on that subway?

25:52.118 --> 25:53.250
I never take it,

25:53.252 --> 25:57.821
But I was in a hurry
to get home, you know? I--

25:57.823 --> 25:58.923
Woman: Sorry to bother you,

25:58.925 --> 26:00.925
But david's buyers
showed up.

26:00.927 --> 26:02.293
Oh. I'll be right down.

26:02.295 --> 26:07.131
Listen. If you're
staying,

26:07.133 --> 26:11.168
Would you like to have
dinner with me later?

26:11.170 --> 26:13.971
Uh, sure.

26:13.973 --> 26:15.639
Ok.

26:17.008 --> 26:19.543
Woman on tv: At least 5
are dead in the shootout.

26:19.545 --> 26:22.146
One person has been
taken into custody.

26:22.148 --> 26:24.481
While their identities
have not yet been released,

26:24.483 --> 26:27.651
The fbi has confirmed
that they are, in fact,

26:27.653 --> 26:32.022
Fugitive members
of joe carroll's havenport cult,

26:32.024 --> 26:33.891
Though the extent
of their involvement

26:33.893 --> 26:36.493
In the recent
new york city attacks

26:36.495 --> 26:38.195
Is still unclear.

26:38.197 --> 26:41.498
Damn! Those fools
got taken out.

26:47.973 --> 26:50.908
[door opens]

26:50.910 --> 26:52.610
Hey.

26:58.383 --> 26:59.550
This is emma.

26:59.552 --> 27:02.186
Emma, this is luke,
giselle,

27:02.188 --> 27:04.221
And you know carlos.

27:04.223 --> 27:06.090
Not really. Hi.

27:06.092 --> 27:07.825
I'm not sure if
bringing her here

27:07.827 --> 27:09.159
Was the smartest
play, bro.

27:09.161 --> 27:11.862
It's ok. She's cool.

27:11.864 --> 27:13.230
Ooh!

27:15.400 --> 27:18.035
Carlos: They do this
french talking thing
all the time.

27:18.037 --> 27:18.902
It drives me crazy.

27:18.904 --> 27:20.237
Why didn't you tell us
joe was alive?

27:20.239 --> 27:24.208
Because I told him
not to.

27:24.210 --> 27:26.610
I didn't know if
we could trust
you people.

27:26.612 --> 27:27.378
Now I guess

27:27.380 --> 27:28.579
It's a moot point.

27:28.581 --> 27:31.215
What do you mean?

27:31.217 --> 27:32.950
Woman on tv:
...But what we do know--

27:32.952 --> 27:35.853
Just to recap--
is that 5 cult members

27:35.855 --> 27:39.390
Were killed today
and a sixth was captured

27:39.392 --> 27:40.924
And taken into custody.

27:40.926 --> 27:44.995
I'd say that date
with my brother just
saved your life.

27:46.331 --> 27:49.633
[grunting]

27:49.635 --> 27:51.101
You're gonna stage
this to make it look

27:51.103 --> 27:53.037
Like the
reverend killed me
and then split,

27:53.039 --> 27:54.304
But nobody's gonna
believe that.

27:54.306 --> 27:56.774
Oh, when they dig around,
I think they'll realize

27:56.776 --> 27:59.309
That the reverend isn't
quite as godly

27:59.311 --> 28:01.311
As he appeared to be.

28:01.313 --> 28:03.914
[tape ripping]

28:06.685 --> 28:09.887
Where's my bloody knife?

28:13.692 --> 28:16.960
Sweetie,
it's right there.

28:19.164 --> 28:21.265
You can do this.

28:28.073 --> 28:30.174
Oh, mandy darling,
the time for this
has passed.

28:30.176 --> 28:31.742
Be a love.
Put the knife down, huh?

28:31.744 --> 28:33.977
No. I don't want to die.

28:33.979 --> 28:35.179
Honey, stab him.

28:35.181 --> 28:37.981
Mandy, stab him!
Stab him, honey!

28:37.983 --> 28:41.518
Stab him, honey!
Do it! Do it!

28:41.520 --> 28:43.187
Do it!

28:43.189 --> 28:46.356
Unh! Aah!

28:46.358 --> 28:47.357
[sobs]

28:47.359 --> 28:51.328
Oh, no! Aah!

28:51.330 --> 28:55.199
No! Aah!

28:55.201 --> 28:57.167
No!

28:57.169 --> 28:58.736
Unh!

29:01.239 --> 29:04.308
I'm sorry, mama,

29:04.310 --> 29:07.044
But I can't let joe go.

29:07.046 --> 29:09.880
Either way, I'm dead, mama.

29:09.882 --> 29:13.350
Living here is death.

29:13.352 --> 29:15.285
Unh!

29:43.915 --> 29:45.816
Fun time's over.

29:45.818 --> 29:49.219
Tell me why we should
keep you around.

29:49.221 --> 29:51.054
Because I was joe's
number two.

29:51.056 --> 29:53.323
He'll come to me.
He barely knows
carlos.

29:53.325 --> 29:55.692
Then why'd he have me
pick him up and not you?

29:55.694 --> 29:56.693
Man's got a point.

29:56.695 --> 29:58.729
Carlos was joe's
errand boy.

29:58.731 --> 30:00.063
I was his
right hand.

30:00.065 --> 30:01.431
I protected his son.
He cares about me.

30:01.433 --> 30:02.766
Carlos means
nothing to him.

30:02.768 --> 30:04.501
See what I mean?
Girl's a bitch.

30:04.503 --> 30:07.371
But my brother
likes her.

30:09.307 --> 30:13.076
And no one
likes you.

30:15.280 --> 30:17.214
Hey, you dick!

30:17.216 --> 30:18.215
He was mine to kill.

30:18.217 --> 30:21.251
Sorry. I'm sorry.
I forgot.

30:21.253 --> 30:23.253
Look. He's
still breathing.

30:23.255 --> 30:25.289
You can finish him off.

30:25.291 --> 30:29.092
Oh, come on. Don't be
like that. Giselle!

30:41.906 --> 30:44.508
[indistinct chatter]

30:48.847 --> 30:50.814
I need you to check
something for me.

30:50.816 --> 30:51.882
You can't be here,
ryan.

30:51.884 --> 30:53.050
I'm trying to be
your friend,

30:53.052 --> 30:54.418
But you're not
helping yourself.

30:54.420 --> 30:55.285
I know, I know.
I'll go,

30:55.287 --> 30:58.488
But I--I need you to
check something for me.

30:58.490 --> 31:00.958
I think I saw something
in the command center.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.426
My ass is
on the line, ryan.

31:02.428 --> 31:03.393
What is it?

31:03.395 --> 31:08.232
Can you show me
the footage from
the subway attack?

31:08.234 --> 31:10.500
Trust me.

31:10.502 --> 31:12.069
I have it
on my skydrive.

31:12.071 --> 31:13.270
What do you
want to see?

31:13.272 --> 31:14.137
Platform footage.

31:14.139 --> 31:15.472
The moment lily
got on the train.

31:15.474 --> 31:18.242
I saw something earlier.
I want to confirm it.

31:18.244 --> 31:22.479
What are you
looking for, ryan?

31:22.481 --> 31:25.082
There. Right there.

31:25.084 --> 31:26.516
What train is that?

31:26.518 --> 31:28.886
Express train. So?

31:30.154 --> 31:31.355
So why didn't she
get on it?

31:31.357 --> 31:34.424
I don't know.
What are you
talking about?

31:34.426 --> 31:36.927
She said she was
in a hurry.

31:37.996 --> 31:39.630
Ryan.

31:42.834 --> 31:45.502
Lily: On this side,
we have an artist.

31:45.504 --> 31:47.804
He is from the camargue.

31:47.806 --> 31:50.107
He is from a place
where there are

31:50.109 --> 31:51.275
Many traditions
about horses,

31:51.277 --> 31:55.712
And obviously,
that is his theme,

31:55.714 --> 31:58.615
And over here,
we have the last painting

31:58.617 --> 32:00.550
Of the collection.

32:00.552 --> 32:05.956
As you can see, we're still
in the world of dreams.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.538
Will you excuse me
for a minute?

32:21.540 --> 32:23.540
Kimmy, would you
just take over here?

32:23.542 --> 32:25.876
-Sure. No problem.
-Thank you.

32:27.745 --> 32:28.912
Hey. What's
going on?

32:28.914 --> 32:30.881
Lily's lying.
She's in on it.

32:30.883 --> 32:33.183
You know, I'm just gonna
grab something.

32:33.185 --> 32:36.553
Mike on radio: 10-0, 10-0.
Lily might be compromised.

32:50.301 --> 32:52.235
Mike: Oh! Damn it!

32:52.237 --> 32:53.437
Agent down!

32:53.439 --> 32:57.541
Lily gray is to be
considered armed
and dangerous.

33:00.812 --> 33:03.080
Where'd she go?

33:10.588 --> 33:12.522
[clatter]

33:12.524 --> 33:15.692
Did you hear that?
I heard something.

a heart attack!

Come on, folks.
Give us some room here.

Move back.

34:03.675 --> 34:06.143
Everybody,
move back.

in both colors.

35:23.621 --> 35:24.688
Hello.

35:24.690 --> 35:25.922
How'd you know?

35:25.924 --> 35:27.224
You said you were
in a hurry,

35:27.226 --> 35:29.726
But you passed up
the express.

35:29.728 --> 35:30.727
I feel like an amateur.

35:30.729 --> 35:33.830
And were just about to
have our first date.

35:33.832 --> 35:34.664
Heh heh. My loss.

35:34.666 --> 35:36.700
Tell me where you are.
We could still grab a bite.

35:36.702 --> 35:39.703
Heh. I'm afraid
you've ruined
our romance, ryan.

35:39.705 --> 35:41.438
I wouldn't call it
a romance.

35:41.440 --> 35:43.874
Oh, don't minimize us.

35:43.876 --> 35:45.742
There was
something there.

35:45.744 --> 35:46.476
I felt it.

35:46.478 --> 35:48.879
Am I the first woman
you've opened up to

35:48.881 --> 35:50.280
Since claire?

35:50.282 --> 35:53.250
I'm honored.

35:53.252 --> 35:55.919
Why go through so much
trouble to get close to me?

35:55.921 --> 35:56.853
You're important to joe,

35:56.855 --> 35:58.555
So you're
important to me.

35:58.557 --> 35:59.589
You were meant to be
my gift to joe.

35:59.591 --> 36:02.425
Now I'll have to
show up empty-handed.

36:02.427 --> 36:05.562
Look. I enjoyed
our time together.

36:05.564 --> 36:06.563
I really did.

36:06.565 --> 36:09.633
I see why joe's
so drawn to you.

to go to new york.

First, huh?

37:44.129 --> 37:46.229
Thanks
for taking me.

I won't
disappoint you.

I worry about
disappointing you.

37:52.804 --> 37:55.805
You won't.

leave this place,

And I can help you.

resourceful.

in you, joe.

be here a while,

You want to ice it.

38:47.192 --> 38:49.125
Good idea.

38:49.127 --> 38:49.993
Yes?

38:49.995 --> 38:53.596
Ok. Ok. I understand.
We are leaving now.

We have to go
now, now, now.

38:57.202 --> 38:58.735
There's no time.
We need to go.

No. We're not
taking her.

Yes, we are!

so sweet.

What the hell
happened?

39:17.055 --> 39:18.888
I vetted her. I did
a full background check.

39:18.890 --> 39:21.057
We did, too.
She's exactly who
she says she is.

39:21.059 --> 39:23.293
The paper trail's
too comprehensive
to be fake.

39:23.295 --> 39:24.994
Well, then how do
we explain the fact

39:24.996 --> 39:26.930
That she just
got up and walked
out of here

39:26.932 --> 39:27.997
Like a trained
assassin?

39:27.999 --> 39:31.267
And you, if you're
holding anything
back on me--

39:31.269 --> 39:33.770
I didn't see it,
all right?

39:33.772 --> 39:35.572
She got by me.

39:35.574 --> 39:36.439
I'm not your enemy,

39:36.441 --> 39:40.744
But I need you to
cooperate with me.

39:40.746 --> 39:44.114
I missed it.
People died.

39:44.116 --> 39:47.417
You don't want me here.

39:47.419 --> 39:50.620
You know.
This is why, mike.

39:50.622 --> 39:52.589
You know.

39:56.861 --> 39:59.462
Can we say a prayer
for mama?

39:59.464 --> 40:01.164
Of course.

40:03.100 --> 40:07.937
Dear lord,
please bless my mom

40:07.939 --> 40:09.839
And reverend glen.

40:09.841 --> 40:12.876
Show them peace
wherever they
may be.

40:12.878 --> 40:19.215
Most important,
please bless joe
for saving me.

40:19.217 --> 40:24.621
And god bless mandy
for having faith in me.

40:24.623 --> 40:27.657
Amen.

40:27.659 --> 40:28.625
Amen.
