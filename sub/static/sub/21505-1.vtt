00:20.988 --> 00:22.522
<i>Can't we just have some fun?</i>

00:22.524 --> 00:25.158
<i>Why does everything
have to be so serious?</i>

00:25.160 --> 00:27.160
<i>Maybe coming here was a mistake.</i>

00:27.162 --> 00:28.661
<i>Don't say that.</i>

00:30.499 --> 00:33.466
<i>Did you see that?</i>

00:33.468 --> 00:35.101
<i>What?</i>

00:35.103 --> 00:37.270
<i>I saw someone
over by the window.</i>

00:38.506 --> 00:40.040
They were looking at us.

00:40.042 --> 00:41.508
Must've been Greg.

00:41.510 --> 00:43.109
I don't think so.

00:45.546 --> 00:46.713
Can you see anything?

00:46.715 --> 00:48.114
No.

00:52.387 --> 00:53.987
What?

00:56.257 --> 00:58.024
I saw someone out there.

00:59.326 --> 01:01.127
They were watching us. I'm going out there.

01:01.129 --> 01:02.529
No.

01:03.097 --> 01:04.931
Jack please, don't.

01:09.203 --> 01:10.737
Thank you, Serena.
Hm-hm.

01:10.739 --> 01:12.572
Are you still at Paradigm?

01:12.574 --> 01:16.042
Uh no, actually I just changed

01:16.044 --> 01:17.477
to Shelley Drucker at ADA.

01:17.479 --> 01:19.279
Oh, he's great.
Hm-hm.

01:19.281 --> 01:20.814
That's a nice step up for you.
Hm-hm.

01:20.816 --> 01:22.215
He's a sweetheart.
Thank you.

01:25.587 --> 01:27.353
Hi Shelley, I'm just calling

01:27.355 --> 01:29.222
to check on what happened
to that Will Smith movie.

01:29.224 --> 01:30.623
<i>Right, they
went with Shaylene Woodley.</i>

01:30.625 --> 01:31.958
Are you kidding?

01:31.960 --> 01:34.794
I mean, I'm never gonna have
a chance with someone like her.

01:34.796 --> 01:36.062
<i>Well that's who
you're gonna be up against</i>

01:36.064 --> 01:37.397
<i>if you want to be
a leading lady,</i>

01:37.399 --> 01:39.466
<i>which brings me
to the horror movie.</i>

01:39.468 --> 01:41.334
I don't know,
a-a slasher movie?

01:41.336 --> 01:42.502
It-it's just not
my kind of thing.

01:42.504 --> 01:43.636
<i>Okay, do me a favor,</i>

01:43.638 --> 01:45.338
<i>watch the short film,
think about it.</i>

03:16.630 --> 03:18.131
You bitch.

03:50.799 --> 03:52.131
No! Bitch!

04:06.214 --> 04:08.514
Alabama Chapman?

04:08.516 --> 04:10.250
That can't be his real name.

04:14.722 --> 04:15.922
Who was the girl?

04:15.924 --> 04:17.890
Hm?
The star.

04:18.524 --> 04:19.591
It doesn't say.

04:19.594 --> 04:21.160
I'm just gonna look her up.

04:23.464 --> 04:25.031
All right, here she is.

04:26.166 --> 04:28.635
Nicole Healy.

04:29.303 --> 04:31.938
She was in six of his movies.

04:32.606 --> 04:33.906
She died.

04:34.341 --> 04:35.808
She was murdered.

04:38.479 --> 04:41.547
She does have
some fan pages, though.

04:49.757 --> 04:51.324
Are you Alabama?

04:51.892 --> 04:53.192
Serena?

04:54.128 --> 04:55.194
You're late.

04:56.363 --> 04:57.697
Yeah.

04:58.465 --> 05:00.767
People are tired
of being lied to.

05:00.769 --> 05:02.635
What they want
is something real.

05:02.637 --> 05:05.672
They'd rather sit at home
and watch YouTube videos

05:05.674 --> 05:06.873
of people falling on their asses

05:06.875 --> 05:09.609
than go to some crap movie
they know is fake.

05:09.611 --> 05:11.010
You know, they get lied to
by the government,

05:11.012 --> 05:12.578
by the news, by their jobs.

05:12.580 --> 05:16.382
What they want is the one thing
they are not being given,

05:16.384 --> 05:17.817
the truth.

05:18.786 --> 05:22.555
I saw one of your short films,
and it looked...

05:23.490 --> 05:25.124
it looked very real to me.

05:25.126 --> 05:27.360
I've been working with the
same crew since I was a kid,

05:27.362 --> 05:29.562
and we all grew up
in North Carolina together.

05:29.564 --> 05:31.664
How many of these shorts
have you done?

05:31.666 --> 05:33.399
17.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.437
We need to make a feature...

05:38.305 --> 05:39.706
and we're ready.

05:40.908 --> 05:43.609
<i>He's smart and
he's really passionate.</i>

05:43.611 --> 05:45.011
<i>Not at all what I expected.</i>

05:45.013 --> 05:46.512
<i>Well, I'll
have them send over a deal.</i>

05:46.514 --> 05:48.414
<i>Serena, this'll be great
for you.</i>

05:48.416 --> 05:50.283
<i>These guys have a million
Twitter followers,</i>

05:50.285 --> 05:52.118
<i>they're financed,
they're paying you.</i>

05:52.120 --> 05:54.220
<i>You're the star.
You'll be great.</i>

05:54.222 --> 05:55.488
<i>The future is yours.</i>

05:55.490 --> 05:56.989
All right, thank you, Shelley.
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

05:56.991 --> 05:58.925
I'll talk to you later.
<i>Okay, bye, babe.</i>

06:00.060 --> 06:02.662
You know, I'm trying
to get excited about this.

06:02.664 --> 06:03.830
You should be.

06:03.832 --> 06:05.498
Yeah?

06:05.500 --> 06:06.666
Four weeks in the woods

06:06.668 --> 06:09.535
surrounded by a bunch
of hot actors and crew?

06:09.537 --> 06:12.705
Well, there's also hot guys
in New York too,

06:12.707 --> 06:15.775
and somehow I manage
to control myself here.

06:15.777 --> 06:16.943
Yeah?

06:18.278 --> 06:19.979
Anyway, that's not
what you're jealous about.

06:19.981 --> 06:21.314
Hmm?

06:21.316 --> 06:23.750
You're just jealous I
got a juicy part in a film.

06:23.752 --> 06:26.619
Oh yeah, probably.

06:35.095 --> 06:37.029
Listen.
Hmm?

06:37.031 --> 06:40.433
Uh, I don't want you
to take this the wrong way,

06:40.435 --> 06:42.802
but I want to do this by myself.

06:44.104 --> 06:45.705
I don't want you to visit me.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.776
Are you serious?

06:49.778 --> 06:51.511
As much as I love you,

06:51.513 --> 06:55.114
with the way things have
been going between us lately...

06:57.184 --> 06:59.919
you're a distraction,
and I need to focus.

06:59.921 --> 07:01.421
You know what, how about this?
Fuck you.

07:01.423 --> 07:03.055
All right?
And just have fun, you know,

07:03.057 --> 07:04.457
fucking all those guys
up there...

07:04.459 --> 07:05.625
Excuse me?
Or whatever you do.

07:05.627 --> 07:07.326
When you did
that summer stock last year,

07:07.328 --> 07:08.928
I stayed out of your way.
Okay.

07:08.930 --> 07:10.096
And who knows who
you were fucking up there.

07:10.098 --> 07:13.032
I was fucking no one and you
could have come, right?

07:13.034 --> 07:14.066
No one told you not to.

07:14.068 --> 07:15.868
I didn't want
to get in your way.

07:15.870 --> 07:17.437
Okay, well I guess
we saw that differently.

07:17.439 --> 07:19.539
Fuck this, I'm gonna stay
at my brother's tonight.

07:19.541 --> 07:23.009
And you know...
call me when you're back.

07:23.011 --> 07:24.143
Whatever, I don't know,

07:24.145 --> 07:26.379
maybe you'll figure
something out by then, okay?

07:48.202 --> 07:49.936
Miss Brooks?

07:53.240 --> 07:54.674
Miss Brooks?

07:54.676 --> 07:55.908
That's me.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.478
Uh, I figured that was you

07:58.480 --> 08:00.446
'cause you look
like a movie star.

08:00.448 --> 08:03.182
I was real excited when I heard
you got the part.

08:03.184 --> 08:05.117
Uh, I seen
your Law and Order episode

08:05.119 --> 08:07.353
like five times.

08:07.355 --> 08:08.688
What's your name?

08:08.690 --> 08:09.856
IBall.

08:09.858 --> 08:11.557
Uh, my-my real name's Raymond,

08:11.559 --> 08:14.227
but uh, everyone calls me IBall,

08:14.229 --> 08:17.697
like iPhone or iMac.

08:17.699 --> 08:19.532
I'm IBall.

08:19.534 --> 08:22.201
Probably on account
of my lazy eye.

08:22.203 --> 08:24.403
But I-I don't mind.

08:24.405 --> 08:26.138
Nice to meet you.

08:26.140 --> 08:27.840
You're the last pickup.

08:27.842 --> 08:29.442
It's a long drive up there.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.946
But you can sit
wherever you want,

08:33.948 --> 08:35.248
you's being the star, and all.

08:35.250 --> 08:37.015
Well
I-I'd be happy to teach you.

08:37.018 --> 08:38.484
Watch your step.

08:38.486 --> 08:40.886
You're doing fine.

08:40.889 --> 08:42.554
Hi, I'm Candice.

08:42.557 --> 08:43.722
Gordon E. Runte.

08:43.725 --> 08:44.924
Serena.

08:44.926 --> 08:48.394
He's from England.
He's Shakespearian trained.

08:48.396 --> 08:49.395
Yes, it's true.

08:49.397 --> 08:52.198
I, um, graduated
from the Royal Academy.

08:52.200 --> 08:54.033
Just finished a touring show
of Hamlet

08:54.035 --> 08:55.234
in which I play the Dane

08:55.236 --> 08:57.803
to a bunch of blue-hairs
from Shropshire.

08:57.805 --> 08:59.672
Looking forward to this,
I can tell you.

08:59.674 --> 09:02.208
Aren't you playing an American
in the film?

09:02.210 --> 09:04.010
Well, fuck yeah.

09:04.012 --> 09:06.312
I play Greg from Kansas City,

09:06.314 --> 09:09.882
a horny little fellow with a
fetish for romantic paperbacks.

09:09.884 --> 09:11.851
I die on page 61.

09:11.853 --> 09:14.687
You don't sound European at all.

09:15.722 --> 09:18.558
You's all are so talented.

09:18.560 --> 09:20.126
Yes we are, IBall.

09:20.128 --> 09:21.527
Yes we are.

09:24.898 --> 09:28.034
This is gonna be
the best movie ever.

09:49.690 --> 09:51.223
<i>I was in a beauty pageant,</i>

09:51.225 --> 09:53.593
and I got seen
by a casting agent,

09:53.595 --> 09:55.528
and he got me
to take acting lessons,

09:55.530 --> 09:59.365
but I started having an affair
with our teacher.

09:59.367 --> 10:01.067
And then
I got a job on a TV pilot,

10:01.069 --> 10:04.036
but the director
wanted to sleep with me.

10:04.038 --> 10:05.338
I think I only got this job

10:05.340 --> 10:06.839
because I agreed
to take my top off.

10:06.841 --> 10:08.074
That's not true.

10:08.076 --> 10:10.343
There's a lot of actresses
who would agree to do that.

10:10.345 --> 10:11.611
Did you?

10:12.579 --> 10:14.046
No.

10:14.048 --> 10:16.449
But I'm just saying that
you must've done something

10:16.451 --> 10:19.485
really great in your audition
to get the part.

10:19.487 --> 10:21.988
It's not just that you're
gonna show your tits.

10:21.990 --> 10:23.489
You're really nice.

10:23.491 --> 10:26.459
You know, I once did
three performances of Macbeth

10:26.461 --> 10:29.595
with nothing but
the cool fog of Glasgow

10:29.597 --> 10:31.797
to cover my little Gordon.

10:31.799 --> 10:34.433
I just don't see why Americans
make such a big fuss over it.

10:34.435 --> 10:36.102
Because we don't
want to be exploited.

10:36.104 --> 10:38.404
Right, Candice?
Right.

10:38.406 --> 10:42.008
But they can't exploit you
if you're doing what you love.

10:42.010 --> 10:44.010
He's right, I guess.

10:44.012 --> 10:46.312
Look, you make up
your own mind about it,

10:46.314 --> 10:48.447
but just because
you signed something

10:48.449 --> 10:50.950
it doesn't mean that you have to do
things that you don't want to do.

10:50.952 --> 10:54.687
I'm-I'm pretty sure
nudity's important to Alabama.

10:54.689 --> 10:56.856
He's a real artist, though.

10:56.858 --> 10:59.358
He-he won't exploit you's.

11:02.664 --> 11:04.363
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>

11:05.365 --> 11:08.000
<i>I really wish you would
pick up your phone.</i>

11:08.002 --> 11:11.704
<i>Look, I hate that we got
into that fight last night.</i>

11:11.706 --> 11:13.706
All right, um... love you.

11:15.409 --> 11:16.709
Hello?

11:21.148 --> 11:23.315
<i>Did you hear that
they cast Blake Stone</i>

11:23.317 --> 11:27.486
I thought he stopped
acting after his breakdown.

11:27.488 --> 11:29.588
Sure uh, I mean I bet he's
been in a ton of stuff

11:29.590 --> 11:30.823
you never saw.

11:30.825 --> 11:32.158
He plays my boyfriend.

11:32.160 --> 11:34.060
Hope he's not an asshole.

11:34.062 --> 11:36.028
What's that mark on your hand?

11:36.030 --> 11:38.197
Oh, that-that-that's our logo.

11:38.199 --> 11:40.933
Everyone on the crew has 'em.

11:40.935 --> 11:43.102
I don't know why it came out
so shitty.

11:43.104 --> 11:45.237
I-I-I thought
it would be better.

11:47.407 --> 11:48.607
I'm just really honored

11:48.609 --> 11:50.843
that they're letting me
work on this.

12:14.802 --> 12:16.569
Serena Brooks, I'm guessing.

12:16.571 --> 12:17.870
Uh, yeah, that's me.

12:17.872 --> 12:19.138
Here let me get that for you.
Oh, thanks.

12:19.140 --> 12:20.506
I'm Walter Sax, I play Harper.

12:20.508 --> 12:22.108
Oh, the bad guy.

12:22.110 --> 12:24.110
That's not for me to judge.

12:24.112 --> 12:26.712
So have you been in many films,
Walter?

12:26.714 --> 12:28.748
Oh, I mean I've known
these guys forever,

12:28.750 --> 12:30.116
so I've been in a lot
of their films.

12:30.118 --> 12:32.318
But I did do a Dunkin' Donuts
commercial down in Nashville.

12:32.320 --> 12:34.820
Hi, I'm Jason.
I'm producing this little epic.

12:34.822 --> 12:36.489
Oh hi, nice to meet you.

12:36.491 --> 12:37.890
You're in cabin number four.

12:37.892 --> 12:39.825
We're using cabins seven,
eight, and nine for shootin'.

12:39.827 --> 12:42.228
There's no cell service up here.

12:42.230 --> 12:45.431
No, but if you need to, IBall
will give you a ride into town.

12:45.433 --> 12:46.966
I can't get the internet
to work, either.

12:46.968 --> 12:49.735
The cable company's coming out
tomorrow to take a look.

12:49.737 --> 12:50.903
How are you going to
make a movie

12:50.905 --> 12:52.605
without a phone or internet?

12:52.607 --> 12:54.473
We're used to roughing it.

12:54.475 --> 12:57.243
We got our grip truck up that
road, that's all we need.

13:19.533 --> 13:21.801
It's all right if
he doesn't want beans.

13:21.803 --> 13:24.470
That's fine.
There's a bean in the green.

13:24.472 --> 13:26.839
Ah, that's just fine.
That's fine.

13:26.841 --> 13:30.176
Oh, hello.
Here you are, sweetheart.

13:30.178 --> 13:33.479
Hi, oh, uh, actually
I don't want that much.

13:33.481 --> 13:37.316
Where I come from we accept
hospitality when it's offered.

13:37.318 --> 13:41.887
Well where I come from its rude
to take more than you can eat.

13:41.889 --> 13:44.023
Well, bless your heart.

13:44.025 --> 13:45.858
You must be Serena.

13:45.860 --> 13:47.593
Is that right?

13:47.595 --> 13:49.195
I'm Molly Beale.

13:49.197 --> 13:52.998
I've been babysitting
some of these little devils

13:53.000 --> 13:55.568
since they were kids. Right?

14:09.683 --> 14:10.382
Hi. Do you...

14:10.384 --> 14:11.517
Listen up!

14:12.152 --> 14:15.187
My people were Ulster Scots,

14:15.189 --> 14:17.156
so it's become a habit of mine

14:17.158 --> 14:18.724
to invoke one of their blessings

14:18.726 --> 14:20.593
at the start of every one
of our films.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.865
<i>Mìle fàilte.</i>

14:25.867 --> 14:27.833
1,000 welcomes.

14:27.835 --> 14:29.668
<i>Mìle fàilte.</i>

14:33.073 --> 14:36.375
Damn, it feels good
to be making a movie again!

14:36.377 --> 14:38.878
And our first feature, no less.

14:39.813 --> 14:43.382
We got some real talent
in this room here.

14:43.384 --> 14:45.684
Serena Brooks.

14:45.686 --> 14:48.687
Blake Stone.

14:48.689 --> 14:52.591
You are all fine
and committed artists,

14:52.593 --> 14:54.460
and we are honored...

14:58.933 --> 15:01.200
Stand back, people!

15:01.202 --> 15:03.369
He had this comin' to him!

15:24.824 --> 15:25.958
Excuse the boys, Serena.

15:26.893 --> 15:29.061
It's just our makeup guys
showin' off.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.531
Fuck, that scared the shit
out of me.

15:34.869 --> 15:35.935
Stone cold shit right there.

15:35.937 --> 15:37.236
<i>Mìle fàilte.</i>

15:37.238 --> 15:40.239
Hell, yeah!
<i>Mìle fàilte!</i>

15:51.785 --> 15:53.252
<i>Maybe just-just a little bit,</i>

15:53.254 --> 15:54.820
and it'll-it'll fall...

15:54.822 --> 15:56.488
All right.
I think.

15:56.490 --> 15:57.489
It's better now That's better.

15:57.491 --> 15:58.424
Yeah.

15:59.025 --> 16:00.592
Is you ready, Miss Brooks?

16:00.594 --> 16:02.227
Okay, she not ready yet.

16:03.296 --> 16:04.730
What you doing there?

16:04.732 --> 16:07.333
Oh um, I brought this from home.

16:07.335 --> 16:09.501
It's cute, right?
It's real cute.

16:09.503 --> 16:13.005
I-I don't know if Alabama's
gonna go for it.

16:13.007 --> 16:15.507
Just let me talk to him
about it.

16:15.509 --> 16:17.109
What do we need for a shot?

16:19.447 --> 16:21.180
Is there a big lighting change
for this?

16:26.119 --> 16:28.687
Hey, everything all right?
You got everything you need?

16:28.689 --> 16:31.423
Uh, yeah, everyone's
been very nice.

16:32.826 --> 16:34.460
Axe the scarf.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.965
Actually I brought this myself.

16:45.038 --> 16:46.805
It's a little much.

16:46.807 --> 16:48.907
We had discussed
that my character

16:48.909 --> 16:52.244
was from around Allentown,
Pennsylvania.

16:52.246 --> 16:55.848
So I did some research
and looked at some photos

16:55.850 --> 16:58.584
and this feels right to me.

17:00.653 --> 17:02.388
I want it to be as real
as you do, okay?

17:02.390 --> 17:04.857
So we can do it your way
and I don't have to wear it

17:04.858 --> 17:07.192
if that's what you want,
but I feel very strongly

17:07.194 --> 17:09.928
that this is the right choice,
if you want it to be real.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.906
You're full of shit.

17:20.907 --> 17:22.340
You didn't look that up.

17:23.410 --> 17:24.877
Had you going though, right?

17:26.480 --> 17:29.381
All right,
whatever she wants from now on.

17:29.383 --> 17:30.549
Okay?

17:31.684 --> 17:34.186
All right, let's get ready
for rehearsal, everybody.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.556
Why does everything
have to be so serious?

17:37.558 --> 17:39.525
Maybe coming up here
was a mistake.

17:39.527 --> 17:41.727
Don't say that, please.

17:43.264 --> 17:45.097
Did you see that?

17:45.099 --> 17:46.031
See what?

17:46.733 --> 17:48.200
I saw someone by the window.

17:48.202 --> 17:49.334
They were looking at us.

17:49.336 --> 17:50.536
That's probably just Greg.

17:50.538 --> 17:52.171
I don't think so.

17:53.740 --> 17:54.740
Can you see anything?

17:54.742 --> 17:55.874
No.

17:57.110 --> 17:58.010
Okay.

18:09.123 --> 18:10.722
There was someone out there.

18:10.724 --> 18:11.890
Are you sure?

18:11.892 --> 18:13.559
They were watching us.

18:14.127 --> 18:15.194
Yeah.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.797
All right, I'll go outside.
What?

18:18.799 --> 18:20.833
No, Jack, don't, please.

18:20.835 --> 18:23.469
It'll be fine.
Just relax.

18:39.219 --> 18:40.486
Jack?

18:45.492 --> 18:46.925
Jack?
Aah!

18:47.928 --> 18:49.928
Jesus!

18:49.930 --> 18:51.730
That is not funny.

18:51.732 --> 18:52.931
I think it's hysterical.

18:52.933 --> 18:54.566
Cut. Excellent.

18:54.568 --> 18:57.336
That was great work, everybody.
Good night.

18:57.338 --> 18:59.104
I'm gonna go talk to Blake.

18:59.839 --> 19:00.639
How was that?

19:01.641 --> 19:03.942
That was as good a first day
as I've ever had.

19:03.944 --> 19:05.544
Wasn't Blake great?

19:05.546 --> 19:07.946
All right, let's wrap it up,
move!

19:10.251 --> 19:13.619
Thank you very much.
That-that was very good, Miss Brooks.

19:13.621 --> 19:14.987
Oh, thank you.

19:14.989 --> 19:17.823
The idea was that
with only one hour's notice

19:17.825 --> 19:20.492
we could put on
any of 13 classics.

19:20.494 --> 19:21.994
I just finished a run of
Merchant of Venice

19:21.996 --> 19:23.996
in San Francisco.

19:23.998 --> 19:25.831
Hm, you were Portia?

19:25.833 --> 19:27.699
For the intent
and purpose of the law

19:27.701 --> 19:29.801
hath full relation
to the penalty,

19:29.803 --> 19:32.171
which here appeareth due
upon the bond.

19:32.173 --> 19:33.739
'Tis very true.

19:33.741 --> 19:36.108
A wise and upright judge.

19:36.110 --> 19:38.777
How much more elder art thou
than thee looks?

19:38.779 --> 19:40.579
Therefor laid bare your bosom.

19:40.581 --> 19:42.214
Aye, his breast.

19:43.116 --> 19:46.185
So says the bond.
Doth it not, noble judge?

19:46.187 --> 19:49.688
"Nearest his heart."
Those are the very words.

19:49.690 --> 19:50.656
It is so.

19:50.658 --> 19:51.990
Are the balance here
to weigh the flesh?

19:51.992 --> 19:55.494
Have by some surgeon, Shylock,
on your charge,

19:55.496 --> 19:58.030
to stop his wounds lest he
do bleed to death.

19:58.032 --> 19:59.464
Maybe we can read some lines

19:59.466 --> 20:01.733
from our scenes
that we have to shoot tomorrow.

20:01.735 --> 20:04.603
Relax Francis, we're bonding.

20:04.605 --> 20:05.904
It's all part of the process.

20:05.906 --> 20:07.606
No, he's worried he
won't remember his lines.

20:07.608 --> 20:09.741
Some of us aren't great
at memorizing lines.

20:09.743 --> 20:12.144
The lines mean nothin'.

20:14.347 --> 20:16.114
Fuckin' lines.

20:18.886 --> 20:20.452
We're out in the woods here.

20:20.454 --> 20:22.621
Rules are different.

20:25.092 --> 20:27.259
One bad choice...

20:30.797 --> 20:32.331
Life is fragile.

20:33.299 --> 20:34.933
You be aware of it.

20:35.602 --> 20:36.868
If you're not...

20:39.138 --> 20:40.706
you're a sittin' duck.

20:42.976 --> 20:44.443
Lines.

20:46.846 --> 20:48.714
Worry about your fucking lives.

20:53.853 --> 20:55.187
What's this?

20:55.189 --> 20:56.622
This is the guy who's gonna fix
our internet.

20:56.624 --> 20:57.889
Fuck that.

20:57.891 --> 20:58.790
Well, we talked about this.

20:58.792 --> 21:02.527
No, we got everything we need
to make this movie right here.

21:02.529 --> 21:04.563
Thanks, but you can go.
No, he can't go, hold on.

21:04.565 --> 21:06.698
He goes or I go.
Don't give me that shit.

21:06.700 --> 21:11.903
Alabama, a lot of people here
have phone calls to make.

21:11.905 --> 21:14.706
Whoa, what the fuck
are you doing?

21:14.708 --> 21:15.974
Yo.

21:18.711 --> 21:19.778
What? Oh my...

21:19.780 --> 21:22.147
Ugh!
Hold up. Don't go.

21:22.149 --> 21:23.615
He just fucking
broke the router.

21:23.617 --> 21:25.150
You don't have another one?

21:25.152 --> 21:26.418
Not in the truck.

21:26.420 --> 21:28.186
Wait, let me explain.

21:28.188 --> 21:29.655
What the hell?

21:29.657 --> 21:32.190
I have a life, Alabama.

21:32.192 --> 21:34.259
I have a relationship back home.

21:34.261 --> 21:35.694
You need to focus.

21:35.696 --> 21:37.162
That is my job.

21:37.164 --> 21:39.831
If you can't trust me
to do my job...

21:39.833 --> 21:41.633
then you need to find
someone else.

21:41.635 --> 21:42.968
I don't trust anybody.

21:42.970 --> 21:45.304
Cell phones, internet, that's
the plague of the movie shoot.

21:45.306 --> 21:47.005
Well my life is important to me.

21:47.007 --> 21:50.575
And is this the most important
thing in your life, this movie?

21:50.577 --> 21:52.978
That is not a fair question.

21:52.980 --> 21:55.781
What's more important, huh?
Your boyfriend?

21:55.783 --> 21:57.683
What, he can't wait three weeks?

21:57.685 --> 21:59.418
Focus on our movie.

22:00.820 --> 22:03.355
It makes a whole world
of difference, trust me.

22:04.857 --> 22:06.224
You'll see.

22:31.885 --> 22:34.252
It's so pretty out here.

22:35.388 --> 22:36.988
I love it up here.

22:38.024 --> 22:41.326
I grew up around here,
just a few towns over.

22:41.328 --> 22:43.695
We used to come up here
on the weekends,

22:43.697 --> 22:45.297
get stoned or drunk,

22:45.299 --> 22:48.300
smoke cigarettes
if that's all we could get.

22:48.302 --> 22:50.302
Maybe go skinny dipping.

22:50.304 --> 22:52.003
I never did anything like that.

22:52.005 --> 22:54.573
My mother would have killed me
if I went skinny dipping.

22:54.575 --> 22:55.874
No you definitely
would have done it

22:55.876 --> 22:58.377
because everybody would have
made fun of you if you didn't.

22:58.379 --> 23:00.812
Everyone made fun of me anyway.

23:10.523 --> 23:13.759
Um, are you sure you know
your way back from here?

23:13.761 --> 23:14.893
Yeah.

23:14.895 --> 23:17.362
We're not that far.
What, you wanna go back?

23:17.364 --> 23:20.799
Uh yeah, it's starting to rain.
You don't mind, do you?

23:20.801 --> 23:23.702
No, we got all weekend.

23:41.154 --> 23:42.454
Saw a cabin up here.

23:42.456 --> 23:45.490
We can sit on the porch
until this passes.

23:45.492 --> 23:46.858
I think it's this way.

24:05.645 --> 24:07.012
Is anyone here?

24:07.747 --> 24:09.481
I don't know.
I doubt it.

24:09.483 --> 24:10.982
These are just weekend cabins.

24:23.996 --> 24:25.897
It looks nice in there.

24:27.266 --> 24:28.600
Looks like we can just go in.

24:28.602 --> 24:30.135
I don't think so.

24:30.137 --> 24:32.504
We'll just go to dry off.
We won't touch anything.

24:39.078 --> 24:40.412
Hello?

24:54.760 --> 24:56.361
Anybody here?

24:59.332 --> 25:01.533
Looks like nobody's here.

25:01.535 --> 25:03.101
There's a dryer in here.

25:03.103 --> 25:06.171
We could dry our clothes...
wait out the storm.

25:06.173 --> 25:08.707
You mean get naked?

25:10.910 --> 25:12.944
Here's a blanket.
You can wrap yourself in that.

25:21.787 --> 25:24.789
If my mother could see me now...

25:37.670 --> 25:39.271
That is better.

25:53.554 --> 25:55.020
What happened?

25:55.022 --> 25:57.622
We gotta get outta here.
There's some weird shit here.

25:57.624 --> 25:59.291
We just gotta go.

26:00.192 --> 26:02.661
Are those fingers?

26:02.663 --> 26:04.763
Ah! Fuck!

26:10.770 --> 26:11.603
Oh, no.

26:15.274 --> 26:16.741
Just run, okay?
I'll catch up.

26:16.743 --> 26:18.109
Run where?!

26:18.111 --> 26:19.511
Go and get help.

26:42.435 --> 26:43.868
Hello?

26:52.144 --> 26:53.845
Who's here?

27:11.764 --> 27:12.998
How was that?

27:13.000 --> 27:15.300
Chloe, that was good work.
Phew.

27:15.302 --> 27:16.901
It's creepy down here.

27:35.688 --> 27:36.588
Hey.

27:37.523 --> 27:39.257
There's someone
I'd like you meet.

27:41.093 --> 27:42.460
Who is it?

27:42.462 --> 27:44.462
Uh...

27:46.832 --> 27:49.968
Mr. Eddie Shipman.
He's our executive producer.

27:49.970 --> 27:51.603
It's because of his,
uh, goodwill

27:51.605 --> 27:54.372
that we're able to make
our pictures, this one included.

27:54.374 --> 27:57.709
So you want me to put on
a pretty face and be nice?

28:02.581 --> 28:06.384
Here she is.
Here is our star.

28:06.386 --> 28:08.620
Look at the way she
lights up a room.

28:08.622 --> 28:10.689
It's like the sun came up,
isn't it?

28:10.691 --> 28:12.323
Hi. Serena Brooks.

28:12.325 --> 28:15.293
Eddie Shipman.
Very happy to meet you.

28:15.295 --> 28:17.529
I must confess,
I'm your number one fan.

28:17.531 --> 28:18.663
Thank you.

28:18.665 --> 28:21.433
Oh and I have a welcoming
present for you as well.

28:21.435 --> 28:23.668
Didn't have to do that.

28:25.372 --> 28:27.672
Oh, wow.

28:27.674 --> 28:30.942
Yes, my family runs a glass
factory in the Pamunkey River.

28:30.944 --> 28:32.944
We make fine tableware.

28:32.946 --> 28:35.380
It's beautiful.
Thank you so much.

28:35.382 --> 28:36.848
Absolutely.

28:36.850 --> 28:39.050
Jason and I, we met in the army
several years ago,

28:39.052 --> 28:40.952
and we bonded over movies,

28:40.954 --> 28:42.921
over horror movies
in particular.

28:42.923 --> 28:44.856
And when he told me
about The Collective...

28:44.858 --> 28:46.725
I was just like
"Sign me up."

28:46.727 --> 28:49.327
Well I'm always a fan of
someone who supports the arts.

28:49.329 --> 28:50.695
Well I haven't
made a dime off of it,

28:50.697 --> 28:52.764
but I wouldn't trade it
for anything.

28:52.766 --> 28:55.433
Now, I love to be involved.

28:55.435 --> 28:57.202
Now when the boys told me
they stepped up

28:57.204 --> 28:58.803
to make a feature,
I was incredibly happy,

28:58.805 --> 29:01.272
and I've been overjoyed
by everything I've seen.

29:01.274 --> 29:02.373
It's all beautiful.

29:02.375 --> 29:04.676
Another beer for you, Mr.
Shipman.

29:07.012 --> 29:09.247
I don't really know why you
keep that halfwit around.

29:09.249 --> 29:12.016
Look at this,
this can's all covered in crud.

29:14.253 --> 29:15.820
I'll get you another one.

29:20.593 --> 29:23.161
Now, I came down here
for a reason.

29:23.163 --> 29:25.530
Alabama is
a brilliant filmmaker,

29:25.532 --> 29:27.465
but his people skills
are lacking.

29:27.467 --> 29:32.070
And Jason is crankier
than a bag of weasels.

29:32.072 --> 29:34.672
If this film goes well
I want you to be excited

29:34.674 --> 29:37.809
about the prospect of working
with us in the future.

29:37.811 --> 29:40.845
I'm gonna be honest,
Mr. Shipman...

29:41.814 --> 29:44.182
I'm having
a really great time here...

29:44.184 --> 29:45.950
but...

29:45.952 --> 29:51.222
I don't want my career
to be a bunch of horror films.

29:54.827 --> 29:56.261
That's just snobbery.

29:57.429 --> 30:00.999
I don't think you will find
film fans or filmmakers

30:01.001 --> 30:03.334
more passionate about
the art of film

30:03.336 --> 30:05.103
than those
that make horror movies.

30:05.105 --> 30:08.907
I guess I just don't share
your passion for the genre.

30:10.242 --> 30:11.576
Shit.

30:12.878 --> 30:17.916
Well, there's time.
There is time to work on you.

30:17.918 --> 30:21.152
And Nicole wasn't exactly crazy
about making horror films

30:21.154 --> 30:22.554
until we started making 'hem.

30:22.556 --> 30:23.988
You knew Nicole?

30:23.990 --> 30:25.423
I financed all her films.

30:25.425 --> 30:27.292
I don't think she had even
seen a horror movie

30:27.294 --> 30:28.660
until we started
working together.

30:28.662 --> 30:32.130
I mean, she was raised Lutheran
and I'm Baptist myself, so...

30:32.132 --> 30:34.098
We were just talking
about Nicole.

30:37.670 --> 30:40.271
I saw that she died.
I'm so sorry.

30:40.273 --> 30:42.774
She was murdered...
We don't talk about that.

30:45.277 --> 30:48.146
I was about to say
it was a tragedy.

30:48.148 --> 30:49.581
We all loved Nicole.

30:52.384 --> 30:55.053
Well she was great in the films
that I saw her in.

30:55.055 --> 30:56.855
I mean, she could've gone out
to LA.

30:56.857 --> 30:58.523
Yeah, she talked about it.

30:58.525 --> 31:00.959
Still it's hard to imagine her
outside of Albemarle County.

31:00.961 --> 31:03.928
Anyway, she didn't really
get the chance.

31:04.997 --> 31:08.700
Uh, A-Alabama, they's calling
for you on set.

31:08.702 --> 31:10.902
I'm coming.
I'm coming too.

31:10.904 --> 31:12.670
It's a closed set.

31:12.672 --> 31:14.272
Not to me.

31:15.241 --> 31:16.541
Lovely to meet you.

31:17.343 --> 31:18.710
Thank you for saying hi...
Yeah.

31:18.712 --> 31:21.112
And think about what I said.

31:21.114 --> 31:22.847
That's a good girl.

31:22.849 --> 31:24.349
I'm coming.

31:26.518 --> 31:29.354
So we're gonna take care
of a few things up here, Chloe.

31:29.356 --> 31:31.289
Just take a couple minutes.

32:55.040 --> 32:56.374
Hello?

32:57.242 --> 32:59.477
Hello?
Action.

32:59.479 --> 33:01.679
Wait, hello?
I-I-I need a minute!

33:01.681 --> 33:04.082
Just one minute!
Action!

33:04.084 --> 33:05.350
No!

33:14.827 --> 33:16.094
What...

33:19.398 --> 33:22.967
What... What's happening?

33:26.271 --> 33:28.272
What are you doing down here?

33:28.274 --> 33:29.941
What?

33:30.576 --> 33:31.943
Who else knows about this?

33:31.945 --> 33:34.879
I don't-I don't... Are-are we-are
we still doing the scene?

33:34.881 --> 33:38.049
We're still doing the scene.
Who else knows about this?

33:38.051 --> 33:39.550
Can we just cut?

33:39.552 --> 33:42.220
I don't understand
what's going on right now.

33:42.222 --> 33:46.958
Oh... I think
you understand everything.

33:46.960 --> 33:49.027
No. I really don't understand
what's going on.

33:49.029 --> 33:51.262
Please tell me.

33:51.264 --> 33:53.231
Please don't.

33:53.233 --> 33:56.601
No. No, no-

33:56.603 --> 33:57.902
Don't worry.

34:08.347 --> 34:10.581
I'll draw you up
with your boyfriend...

34:12.051 --> 34:14.152
and put your eyes together

34:14.154 --> 34:16.987
so you can stare
at each other forever.

34:23.362 --> 34:26.130
What are you's doing down here?

34:26.132 --> 34:27.598
Who else knows about this?

34:27.600 --> 34:29.000
I don't understand.

34:29.002 --> 34:33.204
Oh... I think
you understand everything.

34:33.206 --> 34:35.672
No, no, I really don't
understand what's going on.

34:35.675 --> 34:37.909
Please just tell me.
No, please.

34:37.911 --> 34:39.944
Please don't.

34:39.946 --> 34:43.114
No. No, no!

34:43.116 --> 34:46.951
Now that's just rough,
but it totally works.

34:46.953 --> 34:48.753
It was a good kill.

34:49.621 --> 34:51.889
You see her face
when the knife went in?

34:51.891 --> 34:54.792
That's why we do this.

34:54.793 --> 34:57.161
That was gold.
You can't fake that.

34:58.263 --> 35:00.231
Honestly Al...

35:01.834 --> 35:03.968
that's one of
your best kills yet.

35:06.438 --> 35:08.773
Play it again.
Yes, Sir.

35:08.775 --> 35:11.943
<i>Please don't. No.</i>

35:11.945 --> 35:14.612
Cannot wait to see it all done.

35:14.614 --> 35:16.814
Heh, keep working on Serena.

35:16.816 --> 35:19.317
I want her around
for the next one.

35:19.319 --> 35:21.085
She'll come around.

35:21.087 --> 35:22.653
What choice does she have?

35:22.655 --> 35:24.555
What choice did Nicole have?

35:29.361 --> 35:30.962
Oh and hey, uh,

35:30.964 --> 35:32.463
bring me back a present.

35:32.465 --> 35:34.932
You know how much
I like Barbie dolls.

35:34.934 --> 35:36.367
Don't you fuck it up.

36:20.679 --> 36:24.916
Hey, have you guys seen Chloe?

36:24.918 --> 36:26.884
She finished
shooting her scenes.

36:26.886 --> 36:28.152
The shoot went late last night,

36:28.154 --> 36:31.155
so her and Francis went
straight from set to the train.

36:33.358 --> 36:34.992
I drove 'em.

36:36.295 --> 36:40.464
She's real good in the scenes...
that I saw.

36:41.500 --> 36:42.900
Any chance I
could get a ride to town?

36:42.902 --> 36:45.036
I need to make
a few phone calls.

36:45.038 --> 36:46.771
You'll have to talk
to Alabama about that.

36:46.773 --> 36:48.940
He gave us orders
not to do that.

37:02.487 --> 37:03.955
That smells good.

37:08.860 --> 37:10.127
Can I pour you a cup?

37:12.364 --> 37:14.131
Thanks, I'd love some.

37:23.542 --> 37:28.079
I get these tea leaves
from a friend of mine in China.

37:28.081 --> 37:29.714
He's a private grower.

37:35.387 --> 37:36.887
They're pretty special.

37:38.090 --> 37:40.458
I can't believe they expect us
to go three weeks up here

37:40.460 --> 37:42.460
without a phone call
or an email.

37:45.597 --> 37:47.131
I like the quiet.

37:52.271 --> 37:54.171
You were a child actor?

37:55.274 --> 37:56.240
Look.

37:57.142 --> 37:59.043
I know you're trying
to be nice but...

38:00.345 --> 38:03.347
I don't really like
making friends on set.

38:03.349 --> 38:05.116
It never works out.

38:05.118 --> 38:07.985
I don't mean to sound cold
or anything.

38:07.987 --> 38:09.587
I'm just...

38:11.056 --> 38:12.757
trying to protect myself.

38:16.862 --> 38:18.963
Uh, Mr. Stone.

38:19.831 --> 38:22.199
Uh, they-they need you on set.

38:24.703 --> 38:26.070
Yeah.

38:30.742 --> 38:32.109
Just so you know...

38:33.512 --> 38:35.079
I'll be there for you
on the day.

38:38.050 --> 38:39.550
Mm-hmm.

38:44.456 --> 38:46.624
What is up with that guy?

38:47.759 --> 38:51.295
Yeah, he's an odd character,
that's for sure.

38:53.932 --> 38:55.466
You's actors.

38:56.568 --> 38:59.970
You all have
your idio-synchronicities.

39:02.774 --> 39:04.375
I don't need you
to know where it's going

39:04.377 --> 39:05.676
or why you're doing the things
you're doing.

39:05.678 --> 39:07.178
I want it to be instinctual.

39:07.180 --> 39:09.046
I would never kill anyone
in real life,

39:09.048 --> 39:11.449
so I have to try to imagine
the kinds of things

39:11.451 --> 39:13.884
that would bring my character
to a place where I would.

39:13.886 --> 39:16.887
Okay, I picked you for this part

39:16.889 --> 39:18.956
because I think
that you are a survivor.

39:18.958 --> 39:22.226
Given the opportunity you would
do whatever it took to survive.

39:22.228 --> 39:24.628
You might even relish
the opportunity to prove it.

39:24.630 --> 39:27.465
I think you're confusing
me with my character.

39:27.467 --> 39:29.033
What is this story about?

39:29.735 --> 39:31.369
It's about a bunch of people

39:31.371 --> 39:33.738
who go to the woods
and get killed.

39:33.740 --> 39:35.973
No, it is never about the victims.
Victims die.

39:35.975 --> 39:38.008
They don't even make it through
the whole fucking thing.

39:38.010 --> 39:42.346
The hero is the one who makes
it to the end of the movie.

39:42.348 --> 39:44.315
But it's not even clear
that I do that.

39:44.317 --> 39:46.350
What do people want more than
anything else on this Earth,

39:46.352 --> 39:47.918
more than even sex?

39:49.355 --> 39:50.955
They want to survive.

39:51.890 --> 39:54.125
Haven't you ever
had to defend yourself?

39:58.997 --> 40:01.365
I'm not sure I'm ready
to share that.

40:15.113 --> 40:17.715
Is that Nicole from your films?

40:19.918 --> 40:21.986
Yeah, that's our Nicole.

40:25.390 --> 40:26.557
You remind me of her.

40:27.426 --> 40:28.726
I mean she wasn't
the actor you are,

40:28.728 --> 40:31.729
she wasn't trained
or nothing, but uh...

40:31.731 --> 40:33.697
she was fierce like you.

40:34.299 --> 40:35.866
Always up for a challenge.

40:37.136 --> 40:39.470
In the real world,
she was a high school dropout

40:39.472 --> 40:41.806
who worked at a strip club...

40:43.074 --> 40:47.878
but in our movies...
she was a star.

40:50.449 --> 40:52.016
What's the other one?

40:53.485 --> 40:56.086
"My secret admirer."

40:56.988 --> 40:59.557
That was the last movie
we worked on,

40:59.559 --> 41:01.425
<i>The Secret Admirer.</i>

41:02.928 --> 41:04.829
Died before we could finish it.

41:08.099 --> 41:09.567
You loved her.

41:14.306 --> 41:16.106
I don't like to talk about that.

41:20.946 --> 41:24.014
Cowboy says the-the stuff
is ready for Miss Brooks

41:24.016 --> 41:26.083
to do the mold of her head.

41:28.721 --> 41:31.255
You don't get claustrophobic,
do you?

41:32.491 --> 41:34.158
Is that a warning?

41:35.560 --> 41:37.228
I'm gonna leave some space
under your nose

41:37.230 --> 41:39.163
so you can breathe, but you
won't be able to breathe

41:39.165 --> 41:40.531
out of your mouth.

41:41.800 --> 41:43.067
I've done it a ton of times.

41:43.069 --> 41:44.301
It's fine.

42:21.674 --> 42:24.008
Cowboy, something's wrong.
She needs to stop moving.

42:24.010 --> 42:25.276
Yeah, get her out of there.

42:25.278 --> 42:26.944
Hold still sweetie,
now we're gonna cut you out.

42:26.946 --> 42:30.381
Hold on, all right?
Alabama, it's not set yet.

42:30.383 --> 42:33.417
If we cut her out she's just gonna
have to do it all over again.

42:33.419 --> 42:37.054
Serena, listen,

42:37.056 --> 42:38.422
if I cut you out of there
right now

42:38.424 --> 42:40.257
we're just gonna have
to do this again.

42:40.259 --> 42:42.159
Can you hold on
for just a minute longer?

42:42.161 --> 42:44.328
You were asking me
about Nicole before.

42:44.330 --> 42:45.529
Well, all right.

42:46.164 --> 42:47.865
The first time I met Nicole

42:47.867 --> 42:50.134
was at the Pussy Cat
Topless Bar and Lounge.

42:51.503 --> 42:53.437
I was there with my girlfriend

42:53.439 --> 42:58.342
she just walks right up to me and
starts shaking her wares in my face.

42:58.344 --> 43:01.512
And my girlfriend,
she wasn't such a good sport.

43:01.514 --> 43:04.615
She tossed her Malibu and Coke
in Nicole's face,

43:04.617 --> 43:06.417
and before you could blink,

43:06.419 --> 43:07.885
Nicole, she picked that glass up

43:07.887 --> 43:10.487
and she slammed it down
on the back of her hand.

43:10.489 --> 43:13.557
There was blood everywhere,
it was a fucking shit show.

43:15.260 --> 43:17.027
And that was Nicole Healy.

43:17.896 --> 43:20.297
You know,
she had a snake inside of her

43:20.299 --> 43:23.701
always ready to strike if you
came up on her the wrong way.

43:25.871 --> 43:27.171
All right.

43:27.173 --> 43:29.173
We're gonna
cut you out now, okay?

43:29.175 --> 43:31.575
Have you out in just a second.
You hear that?

43:31.577 --> 43:33.611
Just keep breathin'.
You're doing real nice.

43:33.613 --> 43:36.213
Here we go Serena,
all right, on three, ready?

43:36.215 --> 43:39.450
One, two, and...

43:41.053 --> 43:42.820
There she is.

45:21.920 --> 45:24.488
I'm sorry, can we cut?

45:24.490 --> 45:25.756
Keep rollin'.

45:25.758 --> 45:28.892
I'm just having kind of
a hard time about this.

45:28.894 --> 45:30.127
What's wrong?

45:30.129 --> 45:31.995
Can I talk to you for a minute?

45:36.201 --> 45:37.735
What's wrong, Candice?
That was so great.

45:37.737 --> 45:39.503
Thank you. I'm just-

45:39.505 --> 45:43.073
I'm really uncomfortable about
taking my bra off in this scene.

45:43.075 --> 45:45.275
We talked about this in New York,
you said you were fine with it.

45:45.277 --> 45:47.778
I know, I guess
I thought I could.

45:47.780 --> 45:51.248
You like what I'm doing, right?
I mean, is my acting okay?

45:51.250 --> 45:52.750
Your acting is great.

45:52.752 --> 45:55.219
Then why do I have to
take my bra off?

45:55.221 --> 45:57.955
In this scene
you're taking a shower.

45:57.957 --> 46:02.292
It would be kinda stupid if you
had your bra on in the shower.

46:02.294 --> 46:05.362
Couldn't we shoot
from the shoulders up?

46:05.364 --> 46:07.765
You signed a contract, right?

46:07.767 --> 46:10.567
In the contract it says
you take your bra off.

46:10.569 --> 46:12.469
It explicitly says...
I'm dealing with this.

46:12.471 --> 46:15.072
Maybe if I could speak to my agent
he could straighten this out.

46:15.074 --> 46:17.141
We're set up to shoot now.

46:17.143 --> 46:18.475
Everyone is waiting for you

46:18.477 --> 46:21.812
to do what you told us you
would have no problem doing.

46:23.081 --> 46:24.915
I know, I'm sorry, everyone.

46:24.917 --> 46:25.783
Can I talk to you for a second?

46:25.785 --> 46:27.184
Yeah.

46:50.809 --> 46:52.609
I heard about what you did.

46:54.412 --> 46:57.014
I am so proud of you.

46:57.016 --> 46:58.816
I feel really bad about it.

46:58.818 --> 47:00.918
Everything was going so well
and I screwed it all up.

47:00.920 --> 47:03.453
No, no, no, no, no,
don't say that, okay?

47:03.455 --> 47:06.323
You shouldn't do anything
that you don't want to do.

47:06.325 --> 47:07.758
They all hate me now.

47:08.927 --> 47:11.161
They're just mad
they didn't get their way.

47:11.163 --> 47:12.563
They said they're
gonna drive me into town

47:12.565 --> 47:14.598
so I could call my agent.

47:14.600 --> 47:16.033
That's perfect.

47:16.035 --> 47:17.935
He's the one who should be
dealing with this, not you.

47:17.937 --> 47:20.170
You shouldn't have to
fight with these guys.

47:20.172 --> 47:21.805
You're so good to me.

47:21.807 --> 47:24.241
I hope we can be friends
when we get back to the city.

47:25.343 --> 47:26.877
Definitely.

47:28.413 --> 47:30.714
Yeah, I don't know man.

47:30.716 --> 47:33.517
Hold on, shut the fuck up
for a second.

47:33.519 --> 47:36.153
You said you were gonna give me
a ride into town tonight?

47:36.155 --> 47:38.789
It's getting late.
Oh right.

47:40.758 --> 47:42.125
Here.

47:42.794 --> 47:44.228
Are you serious?

47:44.230 --> 47:46.463
I can't spare anyone right now.

47:46.465 --> 47:48.398
You guys are too much.

50:04.168 --> 50:06.770
Help me!

50:10.309 --> 50:12.175
Help!

50:12.177 --> 50:15.345
Help!
Oh, thank God.

50:15.347 --> 50:16.613
Thank God.

50:17.515 --> 50:18.648
Thank God.

50:18.650 --> 50:20.417
There's someone in the trunk!

50:20.419 --> 50:22.652
Okay Ma'am, calm down,
calm down.

50:22.654 --> 50:23.787
Call an ambulance!

50:23.789 --> 50:26.656
Dispatch, this is unit 114.
Come on.

50:26.658 --> 50:28.658
Looks like we're gonna need
a meat wagon out on highway 34,

50:28.660 --> 50:30.260
two clicks north
of Station Road.

50:30.262 --> 50:31.595
Go.

50:40.905 --> 50:42.005
Holy shit.

50:43.274 --> 50:44.441
Ma'am.

50:44.443 --> 50:46.476
I need you to put your hands
on the roof of the car.

50:46.478 --> 50:47.577
What?

50:47.579 --> 50:50.313
No I'm-I'm just working
on a film shoot.

50:50.315 --> 50:53.316
Ma'am, please put your hands on
the hood of the car right now.

50:53.318 --> 50:54.751
It isn't my car!

50:54.753 --> 50:56.720
I was just driving it
and it broke down!

50:56.722 --> 50:59.990
Put your hands on the car
right now!

51:08.366 --> 51:09.966
Well hey there, cutie!

51:11.069 --> 51:13.103
Looks like you're havin'
a little police trouble.

51:14.672 --> 51:19.076
But you-you didn't think
he was gonna help you, did you?

51:19.078 --> 51:20.343
Police ain't good for nothing.

51:20.345 --> 51:23.213
They're just out
to cut your tail!

51:33.425 --> 51:35.125
Oh, my God.

51:35.127 --> 51:36.593
I heard someone was
having a little problem

51:36.595 --> 51:39.396
doing what they said
they were gonna do.

51:39.398 --> 51:40.964
Let's see if you can
follow my instructions

51:40.966 --> 51:43.233
a little better, huh?

51:45.303 --> 51:47.571
See, I caught your friend there

51:47.573 --> 51:49.706
peekin' on you
when you was in the shower.

51:49.708 --> 51:52.843
And I kept him alive
'cause he's a sicko.

51:52.845 --> 51:54.711
You don't want to end up
like him, do you?

52:00.885 --> 52:04.421
So, why don't you just...

52:04.423 --> 52:06.490
shoot yourself with that...

52:06.492 --> 52:08.758
so I don't have to cut you
with this.

52:10.261 --> 52:12.028
What is it?

52:12.030 --> 52:13.730
My little recipe.

52:15.099 --> 52:17.400
You won't feel a thing.

52:17.402 --> 52:18.902
But this...

52:20.104 --> 52:21.771
Well this, you will.

52:23.307 --> 52:24.441
No!

52:24.443 --> 52:26.343
I'll do it.

52:26.345 --> 52:27.444
Yeah?

52:28.112 --> 52:29.679
Well go on.

52:42.193 --> 52:46.930
You and me gonna be friends
for a long... long time.

53:47.124 --> 53:48.525
Come on.

53:54.031 --> 53:56.833
Let go of me!
Let go of me!

53:56.835 --> 53:58.468
Let go of me!

54:04.843 --> 54:08.278
Soundie! Shit!
You fucking bastards!

54:08.280 --> 54:09.346
Shit.

54:09.348 --> 54:11.381
What the fuck, Walter?

54:13.084 --> 54:14.851
What the fuck man?

54:16.120 --> 54:17.554
What the fuck, indeed.

54:18.589 --> 54:21.391
Who would've thought
that little British guy

54:21.393 --> 54:23.627
could pull off
a stunt like that.

54:23.629 --> 54:25.228
It was a great performance.

54:26.230 --> 54:28.865
He even kept his American accent
the whole time.

54:30.034 --> 54:32.168
He was a real professional.

55:19.984 --> 55:23.386
I've known Soundie
since first grade.

55:24.989 --> 55:27.123
And you too, right Alabama?

55:29.293 --> 55:32.028
Shit, we all knew him...
forever.

55:37.568 --> 55:39.836
You remember
the time the cops...

55:39.838 --> 55:42.505
took our film away and...

55:42.507 --> 55:45.275
Soundie broke into the
station and stole it back?

55:47.478 --> 55:49.512
He was a ballsy little fuck,

55:49.514 --> 55:50.980
that's for sure.

55:54.051 --> 55:55.251
To Soundie.

55:55.886 --> 55:57.654
He died doing what he loved.

56:04.428 --> 56:08.064
I seen him with his dick
in the mouth of one lady,

56:08.066 --> 56:11.701
and his balls in the ass
of another, but...

56:13.104 --> 56:14.738
I never saw him happier
than when he had

56:14.740 --> 56:17.707
a pair of cans on his head
and a boom in his hands.

56:58.015 --> 57:01.284
Hey, hey y'all, uh,

57:01.286 --> 57:02.919
Soundie,

57:02.921 --> 57:04.087
our dear friend and sound man,

57:04.089 --> 57:06.856
he's had to return home
on a family emergency.

57:06.858 --> 57:09.993
How'd he find out
about it, carrier pigeon?

57:12.029 --> 57:12.996
Look.

57:13.731 --> 57:15.432
I know condition's been rough,

57:15.434 --> 57:19.602
but we're making something
real special here.

57:19.604 --> 57:21.638
I thought in honor of Soundie
we would, uh,

57:21.640 --> 57:23.640
show one of our shorts.

57:23.642 --> 57:27.477
We made this in a cold April
down in Sawahanna,

57:27.479 --> 57:29.145
South Carolina.

57:29.147 --> 57:32.982
It stars the great Nicole Healy
in one of her later roles.

57:32.984 --> 57:35.885
Did she refuse
to take her clothes off too?

57:37.955 --> 57:42.058
She was a stripper, so no,
that was never an issue.

57:45.396 --> 57:47.464
There's also a cameo

57:47.466 --> 57:48.298
You all enjoy.
Cutter.

57:48.300 --> 57:51.201
By Soundie.

57:51.203 --> 57:53.102
Woo!
Woo.

57:58.943 --> 58:01.277
You know I didn't
mean nothing by it, right?

58:03.447 --> 58:07.283
Don't get all fucking weepy
on me, I gotta go to work.

58:07.285 --> 58:10.386
I'm not gonna be here
when you get back.

58:10.388 --> 58:12.388
Where the fuck are you gonna go?

58:56.667 --> 58:59.836
Something's changed,
don't you think?

59:01.505 --> 59:04.474
Can you feel it? Everyone's
acting really strange.

59:06.377 --> 59:08.144
We have been
in the woods a while.

59:09.680 --> 59:11.548
Don't you think it's weird
that the actors

59:11.550 --> 59:14.517
just sort of disappear
when they're done shooting?

59:14.519 --> 59:16.886
That's what happens
on film sets.

59:18.055 --> 59:21.624
When you're done
they ship you out

59:21.626 --> 59:26.129
so the producers...
don't have to pay extra days.

59:27.364 --> 59:28.731
Why?

59:28.733 --> 59:30.667
What did you think was going on?

59:31.735 --> 59:33.102
I don't know.

59:35.606 --> 59:37.040
But I'm worried about Candice.

59:37.042 --> 59:40.410
She wouldn't have left
without saying goodbye to me.

59:40.412 --> 59:42.045
Did you talk to her at all?

59:43.914 --> 59:45.281
She left me a note.

59:55.826 --> 59:57.260
You two hooked up?

59:57.728 --> 59:59.062
You didn't know?

01:00:00.798 --> 01:00:03.333
I guess you weren't as close
as you thought.

01:00:04.768 --> 01:00:06.235
I guess not.

01:00:06.237 --> 01:00:08.171
I told you
about these film sets.

01:00:09.473 --> 01:00:10.640
I told you not to get attached.

01:00:10.642 --> 01:00:13.710
I know, I know,
you're protecting yourself.

01:00:18.782 --> 01:00:20.016
She's a grown-up.

01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:23.219
We both knew what we wanted
from each other.

01:00:24.221 --> 01:00:26.990
Contrary to what
you might think of me,

01:00:26.992 --> 01:00:28.858
I'm not an asshole.

01:00:31.095 --> 01:00:32.528
She's a nice girl.

01:00:33.597 --> 01:00:35.565
She's one of these girls
that lives in a bubble,

01:00:35.567 --> 01:00:36.432
in this dream.

01:00:37.534 --> 01:00:39.469
She's like a puppy who's trying
to get at a bone

01:00:39.471 --> 01:00:40.837
and she keeps
getting kicked back.

01:00:40.839 --> 01:00:43.573
But no matter how many times
she gets kicked back...

01:00:43.575 --> 01:00:46.109
she keeps getting up
with this sweet smile...

01:00:47.177 --> 01:00:48.811
and asks for more.

01:00:49.947 --> 01:00:53.049
This world can be tough
on people like that, you know?

01:00:54.351 --> 01:00:55.818
Soundie!

01:00:57.522 --> 01:00:58.688
Soundie!

01:00:58.690 --> 01:00:59.856
Soundie!

01:01:00.524 --> 01:01:01.824
I don't get you.

01:01:01.826 --> 01:01:04.694
If you think
something's weird or bad...

01:01:04.696 --> 01:01:06.229
then why don't you just quit?

01:01:07.464 --> 01:01:08.865
I'm an actress.

01:01:08.867 --> 01:01:10.466
Oh, Jesus.

01:01:11.536 --> 01:01:14.203
The show must go on, right?

01:01:17.441 --> 01:01:19.942
Besides,
I could just be paranoid.

01:01:21.745 --> 01:01:23.246
Yep.

01:02:20.871 --> 01:02:23.439
No! No!

01:02:32.549 --> 01:02:34.650
Fuck.

01:02:34.652 --> 01:02:36.185
Fuckin' shoot me.

01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:38.454
Fuckin' shoot me.

01:02:38.456 --> 01:02:39.822
Hm?

01:02:57.441 --> 01:02:58.708
See?

01:02:59.643 --> 01:03:01.244
It's never about the victim.

01:03:39.449 --> 01:03:42.018
IBall, IBall,

01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:43.486
are you going to town?

01:03:43.488 --> 01:03:47.089
Oh... please, Miss Brooks,

01:03:47.091 --> 01:03:48.991
Jason's thinking of giving me
a promotion

01:03:48.993 --> 01:03:52.195
so I-I can't really risk
fuckin' up like that now.

01:03:52.197 --> 01:03:53.729
I understand.

01:04:36.306 --> 01:04:38.741
Okay.

01:05:39.470 --> 01:05:41.070
I'm worried about them.

01:05:42.206 --> 01:05:43.773
There's one path
leading from the camp

01:05:43.775 --> 01:05:45.708
and this is where it goes.

01:05:46.810 --> 01:05:48.511
And what do you think
happened to 'em?

01:05:49.646 --> 01:05:51.347
Maybe they got lost.

01:05:52.215 --> 01:05:53.749
Cut.

01:05:53.751 --> 01:05:55.985
Serena, that was great.
You're wrapped for the night.

01:05:55.987 --> 01:05:57.787
We just need Blake
for a couple more shots.

01:05:57.789 --> 01:05:59.155
Thanks, everybody.

01:06:01.091 --> 01:06:04.460
Hey, did you know Nicole, IBall?

01:06:04.462 --> 01:06:06.862
I-I knew her a little,
you know,

01:06:06.864 --> 01:06:08.698
just from hanging around
with these guys.

01:06:09.933 --> 01:06:14.637
Did you ever see any of her
last film, <i>The Secret Admirer?</i>

01:06:14.639 --> 01:06:17.173
I-I've seen a few bits of it.

01:06:17.175 --> 01:06:19.008
It looked good, but...

01:06:20.978 --> 01:06:22.345
Well, hey-hey-hey...

01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:23.612
but what?

01:06:27.551 --> 01:06:30.753
Uh, well, uh, Mr. Shipman
wrote the script on that

01:06:30.755 --> 01:06:34.757
and I-I-I don't think Alabama
thought too much of it.

01:06:34.759 --> 01:06:36.826
There was some disagreement
between them

01:06:36.828 --> 01:06:39.862
that I wasn't privy to.

01:06:39.864 --> 01:06:43.666
They still get angry about it
when they get drunk.

01:06:43.668 --> 01:06:46.402
But let's go to your room,
Miss Brooks.

01:06:48.205 --> 01:06:49.672
Oh, I almost forgot, um,

01:06:49.674 --> 01:06:52.341
Alabama says that he
needs Cutter on set.

01:06:53.477 --> 01:06:56.312
Oh, okay.
Uh, uh, I'll go get him.

01:06:57.914 --> 01:06:59.181
Where they at?

01:06:59.183 --> 01:07:00.883
I'll take you.

01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:24.407
Hello?

01:08:15.226 --> 01:08:20.196
Actors are ready.
Alabama, look at me, come on, please.

01:08:20.198 --> 01:08:21.997
Soundie, you're in frame.

01:08:21.999 --> 01:08:23.799
Alabama.

01:08:23.801 --> 01:08:25.100
What's that 150
doing there, Shooter?

01:08:25.103 --> 01:08:28.203
Come on Shooter,
we gotta get this shot.

01:08:28.206 --> 01:08:29.872
Just get that light
out of there.

01:08:29.874 --> 01:08:32.774
<i>Is camera rolling?
Alabama, look at me!</i>

01:08:32.777 --> 01:08:33.843
<i>It's been running.
Look at me.</i>

01:08:33.845 --> 01:08:35.411
<i>Come on, fucker, look at me!</i>

01:08:35.412 --> 01:08:36.745
<i>Soundie, get out of the frame.</i>

01:08:36.747 --> 01:08:39.682
<i>Alabama! I'm sorry!</i>

01:08:39.684 --> 01:08:41.250
Jesus Christ!

01:08:41.252 --> 01:08:43.252
Action.
No I-No.

01:08:43.254 --> 01:08:44.953
Walter don't do-you
come near me with that thing,

01:08:44.956 --> 01:08:46.287
I fucking swear! Fuck off!

01:08:46.290 --> 01:08:47.189
Say the fucking lines!

01:08:47.191 --> 01:08:48.256
Fuck you!

01:08:48.259 --> 01:08:50.626
Say the fucking lines!

01:08:50.627 --> 01:08:53.595
I didn't do anything!
I wouldn't...

01:08:53.598 --> 01:08:56.332
Al, I love you, come on.

01:08:56.334 --> 01:08:58.033
You're breaking my heart.

01:09:01.938 --> 01:09:04.106
<i>Okay, I'll say the lines.</i>

01:09:04.108 --> 01:09:05.341
<i>Get that fucker back to one.</i>

01:09:05.343 --> 01:09:06.841
<i>Get back to one, Walter.</i>

01:09:09.345 --> 01:09:10.546
Action.

01:09:10.548 --> 01:09:13.482
I'll give you anything
if you untie me.

01:09:13.484 --> 01:09:14.683
I already have what I need.

01:09:14.685 --> 01:09:17.685
Not me. Not me for real.

01:09:17.688 --> 01:09:19.587
Oh, I don't want your love.

01:09:23.193 --> 01:09:24.792
I love you, Alabama.

01:09:24.795 --> 01:09:26.495
Sorry I fucked up your film.

01:09:26.497 --> 01:09:27.897
Nicole!

01:09:27.899 --> 01:09:29.665
Shit, fuck no.

01:09:31.068 --> 01:09:32.434
Fuck no.

01:09:32.435 --> 01:09:33.935
No!

01:09:40.810 --> 01:09:42.077
Oh!

01:09:42.946 --> 01:09:44.546
No! No!

01:09:44.549 --> 01:09:46.482
Oh, my God.

01:09:49.252 --> 01:09:50.419
Nicole.

01:10:12.342 --> 01:10:13.609
I want Blake.

01:10:19.049 --> 01:10:21.517
I wan-I want-
I want to see-I want to see...

01:10:45.108 --> 01:10:46.175
Hello?

01:10:50.313 --> 01:10:51.513
Hello?

01:10:53.883 --> 01:10:56.552
Oh, uh, can I help you?
Who are you?

01:10:56.554 --> 01:10:59.088
I'm a friend of Serena Brooks.

01:10:59.090 --> 01:11:00.589
Oh, yeah?

01:11:00.591 --> 01:11:02.925
Yeah, uh, do you know
where I can find her?

01:11:02.927 --> 01:11:06.362
She's on set. She's
shooting up by the lake.

01:11:07.797 --> 01:11:09.131
You her boyfriend?

01:11:10.233 --> 01:11:11.867
That's right.

01:11:11.869 --> 01:11:13.302
Brian?
Uh-huh.

01:11:13.304 --> 01:11:15.671
Yeah, she told me about you.

01:11:15.673 --> 01:11:18.240
Yeah, she uh,
invited me up, so...

01:11:18.242 --> 01:11:20.075
Oh really?

01:11:20.710 --> 01:11:22.845
I wonder how she did that.

01:11:24.147 --> 01:11:25.748
So, um, can I...

01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:27.716
Can I go to where
she's shooting or is-

01:11:27.718 --> 01:11:29.718
Oh you know no
one is allowed on set

01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:31.654
because the director
doesn't like distractions.

01:11:31.656 --> 01:11:32.621
Right.

01:11:32.623 --> 01:11:35.124
But I just made
a fresh pot of coffee.

01:11:35.126 --> 01:11:37.726
Would you like to sit down
and have a cup?

01:11:37.728 --> 01:11:40.429
They'll be done in just
a short while, I'm sure.

01:11:41.898 --> 01:11:45.301
Hey you want to take
a look at this next scene?

01:11:45.303 --> 01:11:46.802
What do you mean?

01:11:46.804 --> 01:11:49.038
Well, have you ever
done a fight scene before?

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:52.308
I've done a few, but uh,
Alabama usually directs that,

01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:54.109
so maybe go
ask him your questions.

01:11:54.111 --> 01:11:55.544
Well, why don't
we just go through

01:11:55.546 --> 01:11:57.212
and see what we
can come up with.

01:11:57.214 --> 01:11:58.280
All right.

01:12:11.461 --> 01:12:14.096
Now I just gotta go out to the
fridge and get some milk, okay?

01:12:14.098 --> 01:12:15.531
Oh, please.
Yeah. Thank you.

01:12:15.533 --> 01:12:16.732
All right.

01:12:21.739 --> 01:12:22.871
Fuck!

01:12:25.875 --> 01:12:27.676
Bless your heart.

01:12:32.115 --> 01:12:33.515
If you're coming up like this,
right,

01:12:33.517 --> 01:12:34.650
and you wanna come...
Like this?

01:12:34.652 --> 01:12:36.485
Yeah, and then you wanna
come down like that...

01:12:36.487 --> 01:12:39.355
All right.
So I can get some separation, right?

01:12:39.357 --> 01:12:41.457
And I'll have you there,

01:12:41.459 --> 01:12:42.758
I figure I'll get a hit in there

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:45.094
and I'll just bring this right
around, how does that work?

01:12:46.831 --> 01:12:49.798
If you bring that knife
that close to me another day,

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:50.966
I'll cut your balls off.

01:12:50.968 --> 01:12:52.501
Yeah, we'll see about that.
What the hell is this?

01:12:52.503 --> 01:12:55.237
Yeah?
We're fine. Cool.

01:12:55.239 --> 01:12:56.839
Trying to get a handle
on this next scene

01:12:56.841 --> 01:12:58.140
and wonder boy Walter over here

01:12:58.142 --> 01:12:59.575
don't know dick
about stage fighting.

01:12:59.577 --> 01:13:01.210
Oh, fuck you, you're just...
Oh, fuck you.

01:13:01.212 --> 01:13:03.679
Walter can handle himself
just fine.

01:13:03.681 --> 01:13:05.414
Look, I know
you're cutting corners

01:13:05.416 --> 01:13:07.649
in order to complete
your picture,

01:13:07.651 --> 01:13:10.085
but I'm noticing a severe lack
of respect

01:13:10.087 --> 01:13:11.787
for the safety of these actors.

01:13:15.091 --> 01:13:16.492
All right.

01:13:17.694 --> 01:13:20.362
Blake, why don't you take 10?

01:13:25.268 --> 01:13:26.635
Cutter?

01:13:26.637 --> 01:13:28.871
What the hell you doing here?

01:13:28.873 --> 01:13:30.906
IBall said you wanted to see me.

01:13:30.908 --> 01:13:33.709
I didn't say...
IBall!

01:13:33.711 --> 01:13:36.278
<i>Action.
Please don't.</i>

01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:37.746
No. No!

01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:44.920
What the fuck, Walter?

01:13:51.561 --> 01:13:52.895
I thought so.

01:13:52.897 --> 01:13:53.929
Uh.

01:13:57.267 --> 01:14:00.502
You won't do anything to me
without Alabama here.

01:14:00.504 --> 01:14:02.638
Try that again and I will.

01:14:04.274 --> 01:14:05.707
He's on his way.

01:14:12.782 --> 01:14:14.416
Alabama ain't gonna be too happy

01:14:14.418 --> 01:14:16.585
when he finds out
you've been watching this.

01:14:17.887 --> 01:14:19.988
Aah! Aah!

01:14:22.358 --> 01:14:24.827
Now I'm gonna have to cut you.

01:14:25.962 --> 01:14:26.995
Hey.

01:14:34.571 --> 01:14:36.705
They're gonna kill us.
We get outta here.

01:14:42.579 --> 01:14:43.712
We gotta find some car keys,

01:14:43.714 --> 01:14:45.848
or some bus keys,
or whatever the fuck.

01:14:45.850 --> 01:14:47.783
They all panicked when you
sent Cutter up to set

01:14:47.785 --> 01:14:49.818
and they're all looking for you
and we're fucked.

01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:50.986
There's nothing here.

01:14:51.989 --> 01:14:53.455
Wait, you came back for me?

01:14:53.457 --> 01:14:55.123
I told you I wasn't an asshole.

01:14:55.125 --> 01:14:57.926
Come on. This way.

01:15:01.965 --> 01:15:03.098
Hey...

01:15:04.501 --> 01:15:07.002
Aren't you supposed to be
on set?

01:15:07.004 --> 01:15:08.537
Uh...

01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:13.108
Hey Blake, don't
fuck around with that.

01:15:13.110 --> 01:15:14.776
Are there blanks in here?

01:15:15.645 --> 01:15:17.145
Are these real shells?

01:15:17.981 --> 01:15:21.149
Why would I put real shells
in there?

01:15:21.151 --> 01:15:22.851
That's what I was wondering.

01:15:24.354 --> 01:15:25.988
I just don't know.
Cowboy...

01:15:32.595 --> 01:15:34.229
Ugh!

01:15:35.064 --> 01:15:37.299
Fuck! Come on!

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:46.008
Don't fucking touch it!

01:15:47.745 --> 01:15:49.011
I-I can't leave you.
Just go!

01:15:49.013 --> 01:15:50.512
Just fucking run!
Okay!

01:15:50.514 --> 01:15:51.880
Shit!

01:15:59.455 --> 01:16:01.857
Shooter, roll it!
Speed.

01:16:02.892 --> 01:16:05.027
I want it tighter on him.

01:16:05.029 --> 01:16:06.528
Walter, are you ready?
I'm ready.

01:16:06.530 --> 01:16:08.363
IBall, get the
fuck outta the shot!

01:16:09.867 --> 01:16:11.700
Action. Go on!

01:16:11.702 --> 01:16:13.702
Stupid fucking hicks.

01:16:13.704 --> 01:16:15.571
Well, it's about goddamn time
one of you pussies

01:16:15.573 --> 01:16:16.939
put up a fight.

01:16:16.941 --> 01:16:20.876
I'll bet you're as shitty at
killing as you are at acting.

01:16:20.878 --> 01:16:23.378
Fuck you.
What sort of fuck are you now?

01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:24.580
Quit fucking around, Walter.

01:16:24.582 --> 01:16:26.281
Get in there and kill him.

01:16:29.052 --> 01:16:30.285
Ah!

01:16:33.457 --> 01:16:35.357
Ah!

01:16:47.237 --> 01:16:49.004
Camera up.
Keep the camera up.

01:16:49.006 --> 01:16:49.972
Keep rolling.

01:17:01.951 --> 01:17:04.987
That's... fucking... acting!

01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:12.327
No...

01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:16.131
Shooter.

01:18:13.022 --> 01:18:14.222
Hello?

01:18:16.459 --> 01:18:17.626
Hello?

01:18:45.555 --> 01:18:46.788
Hello?

01:18:48.491 --> 01:18:49.424
Ow.

01:19:28.731 --> 01:19:30.365
Kill me.

01:19:33.269 --> 01:19:35.704
Kill me.

01:19:39.343 --> 01:19:40.475
Shit!

01:19:40.477 --> 01:19:41.910
Oh, God!

01:19:45.648 --> 01:19:47.449
Miss Brooks!

01:19:48.218 --> 01:19:50.085
You shouldn't be down there!

01:19:51.121 --> 01:19:55.657
IBall, please, please...

01:19:55.659 --> 01:19:58.026
Please, you have to help me.
I need the keys to that truck.

01:19:58.028 --> 01:19:59.661
Those are back in the office.

01:19:59.663 --> 01:20:01.496
Fuck! Fuck!

01:20:01.498 --> 01:20:03.064
Fuck!

01:20:09.405 --> 01:20:11.640
Please... please.

01:20:16.345 --> 01:20:18.079
Take this. You have to run.

01:20:18.081 --> 01:20:19.481
Okay.
If they find out they'll kill me!

01:20:19.483 --> 01:20:21.550
Thank you. Thank you!

01:20:40.436 --> 01:20:41.803
Shit!

01:20:47.643 --> 01:20:50.145
Get those lights on!
She's in there!

01:20:51.747 --> 01:20:53.481
Lights!

01:21:12.935 --> 01:21:15.503
I know you're in there, Serena.

01:21:17.173 --> 01:21:21.476
Come on...
let's work this scene out.

01:21:21.478 --> 01:21:23.278
You won't kill me.

01:21:24.413 --> 01:21:26.982
You won't kill me.
I'm the star of your movie.

01:21:26.984 --> 01:21:29.217
But you have to earn that title,

01:21:29.219 --> 01:21:31.019
just like Nicole did.

01:21:31.021 --> 01:21:32.787
I'm not Nicole.

01:21:35.691 --> 01:21:37.592
I can't kill anyone.

01:21:37.594 --> 01:21:40.295
You'll do what you have to do
to stay alive.

01:21:41.564 --> 01:21:44.332
What kinda hero would you be
if you didn't do that?

01:21:45.801 --> 01:21:48.103
The kind that dies at the end.

01:21:48.105 --> 01:21:50.205
Shit.

01:21:50.207 --> 01:21:52.274
Oh, shit.

01:21:53.409 --> 01:21:56.278
I can't let you
just walk outta there.

01:22:20.837 --> 01:22:23.238
She's got some fight in her!

01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:24.439
Good!

01:22:24.441 --> 01:22:25.573
Don't give up.

01:22:25.575 --> 01:22:28.310
We gotta see this movie
through to the end.

01:22:30.046 --> 01:22:32.714
Now Nicole, she didn't get it
at first either.

01:22:32.716 --> 01:22:36.885
Pretty soon she was down for
everything we threw at her.

01:22:36.887 --> 01:22:39.087
Why did she kill herself
like that?

01:22:40.256 --> 01:22:41.756
Shipman killed her.

01:22:43.259 --> 01:22:44.726
And he was crazy about her.

01:22:45.761 --> 01:22:48.029
She didn't want to have
anything to do with him.

01:22:49.365 --> 01:22:51.099
He was jealous of me.

01:22:51.634 --> 01:22:53.368
It was a big mess.

01:22:55.071 --> 01:22:58.173
Then he wrote
<i>the Secret Admirer.</i>

01:22:58.175 --> 01:22:59.374
It was scene after scene

01:22:59.376 --> 01:23:03.011
of Nicole
just getting beat to hell.

01:23:03.913 --> 01:23:06.181
He wouldn't let up
until he had her.

01:23:07.683 --> 01:23:09.417
And then when he did have her...

01:23:11.187 --> 01:23:12.487
he broke her...

01:23:13.522 --> 01:23:16.458
so she struck back
the only way she knew how.

01:23:18.127 --> 01:23:19.694
She ruined his movie.

01:23:21.031 --> 01:23:22.964
Why'd you let him
get away with that?

01:23:22.966 --> 01:23:26.935
There wasn't much I could
do if I wanted to stay outta jail.

01:23:26.937 --> 01:23:30.672
He owns the police down there.
He owns half the state.

01:23:30.674 --> 01:23:32.374
He's a money man.

01:23:33.476 --> 01:23:35.143
When I couldn't get a film made,

01:23:35.145 --> 01:23:37.679
Shipman made things happen.

01:23:38.481 --> 01:23:40.615
If you make a deal
with the devil,

01:23:40.617 --> 01:23:43.151
then the devil takes your soul!

01:24:31.167 --> 01:24:32.500
Cut!

01:26:46.602 --> 01:26:48.002
Fuck!

01:27:06.922 --> 01:27:08.022
Are you all right Ma'am?

01:27:08.024 --> 01:27:10.425
Uh...
Y-yeah, yeah.

01:27:10.427 --> 01:27:11.759
You can't park here.
Okay.

01:27:11.761 --> 01:27:13.561
Police cars only.
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

01:27:13.563 --> 01:27:15.763
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:27:23.505 --> 01:27:25.406
Would you like some coffee?

01:27:25.408 --> 01:27:27.242
Yeah, thank you.

01:27:27.244 --> 01:27:28.643
You're welcome.

01:28:00.476 --> 01:28:02.010
<i>Serena?</i>

01:28:05.047 --> 01:28:08.449
How are you going to get away
with all of this?

01:28:08.451 --> 01:28:10.718
<i>Who says we're
getting away with anything?</i>

01:28:15.858 --> 01:28:17.392
Then why?

01:28:18.327 --> 01:28:19.694
The movie.

01:28:20.562 --> 01:28:22.363
That's all that matters now.

01:28:23.732 --> 01:28:25.700
Get away with it while we can.

01:28:26.435 --> 01:28:28.336
<i>No one's caught us so far.</i>

01:28:30.139 --> 01:28:32.807
Once they realize
that Blake is missing...

01:28:32.809 --> 01:28:35.243
He'll get more publicity
than he ever got before.

01:28:35.245 --> 01:28:38.513
He's a great actor
and he's great in this.

01:28:38.515 --> 01:28:40.882
<i>You ought to come down
to Yancey County with us.</i>

01:28:40.884 --> 01:28:42.350
<i>We can protect you.</i>

01:28:44.019 --> 01:28:45.987
That your boyfriend's car
you're driving?

01:28:47.691 --> 01:28:50.391
You might want to ditch it
before you head home.

01:29:28.063 --> 01:29:30.832
Thinking I'm gonna take
my chances with the police.

01:29:30.834 --> 01:29:32.266
<i>What are they gonna do?</i>

01:29:32.268 --> 01:29:35.069
<i>Send the FBI to arrest us?
That'll be the day.</i>

01:29:35.071 --> 01:29:39.140
There'd be some killing
on both sides, that's for sure.

01:29:39.142 --> 01:29:41.676
Ain't gonna work out the way
you want it to.

01:29:42.745 --> 01:29:44.645
Might make a pretty good movie.

01:29:45.681 --> 01:29:48.249
<i>Candice won't make it,
that's for sure.</i>

01:29:49.585 --> 01:29:50.852
Candice?

01:29:50.854 --> 01:29:52.754
<i>Shipman has her.</i>

01:29:52.756 --> 01:29:56.758
<i>He's got her drugged up and he's
keeping her locked in his house.</i>

01:29:56.760 --> 01:29:58.826
Look by your TV.

01:30:21.417 --> 01:30:23.451
<i>You wanted to be a star.</i>

01:30:24.453 --> 01:30:26.354
<i>Look at what we did together.</i>

01:30:27.122 --> 01:30:29.190
<i>You know how special that is?</i>

01:30:29.192 --> 01:30:31.959
I know you feel it,
'cause I feel it too.

01:30:32.928 --> 01:30:35.062
<i>You can't turn your back
on that.</i>

01:30:37.666 --> 01:30:40.368
I'm not ending up like Nicole.

01:30:40.370 --> 01:30:42.403
Come down to Yancey County
with us.

01:30:43.338 --> 01:30:45.540
We've got one more scene
we need to shoot.

01:31:05.994 --> 01:31:07.962
The crew came up
to this abandoned camping lodge

01:31:07.964 --> 01:31:10.298
to begin shooting their
latest film, <i>The Collector.</i>

01:31:10.300 --> 01:31:12.600
The last form of communication
was from a cellphone

01:31:12.602 --> 01:31:14.268
of the film's star,
Serena Brooks.

01:31:14.270 --> 01:31:17.271
Now she is missing, along with
everyone else involved with the film.

01:31:23.445 --> 01:31:25.980
Police are asking
anyone with any information

01:31:25.982 --> 01:31:28.449
to contact them.

01:31:29.652 --> 01:31:31.752
What the Sam
Hill's going on here...

01:31:33.222 --> 01:31:34.288
Alabama?

01:31:35.157 --> 01:31:36.791
What the hell are you doing
down here?

01:31:39.729 --> 01:31:41.362
Fuck! Fuck!

01:31:41.364 --> 01:31:43.965
Fuck. Ah! Ah, stop!

01:31:43.967 --> 01:31:46.701
Stop it!
Stop it, damnit, you pig!

01:31:46.703 --> 01:31:48.569
How dare you come
in my fuckin'-

01:31:48.571 --> 01:31:49.704
Fuck.

01:31:49.706 --> 01:31:51.572
God damnit! Ah!

01:31:51.574 --> 01:31:54.976
You fucking pig! You pig! Fuck!

01:31:54.978 --> 01:31:56.944
Fuck you. God damn!

01:31:56.946 --> 01:32:01.249
Ah! Ow! Fuck! Ugh.

01:32:01.917 --> 01:32:03.284
Fuck you!

01:32:06.054 --> 01:32:08.256
You won't make it
outta the goddamned state.

01:32:21.737 --> 01:32:24.372
Come on, honey.
You're gon' wake up now.

01:32:34.516 --> 01:32:35.783
Hey.

01:32:53.869 --> 01:32:56.437
I have a message from Nicole.

01:33:00.509 --> 01:33:01.943
Shipman!

01:33:03.780 --> 01:33:05.846
You think you got a piece of me?

01:33:07.349 --> 01:33:10.217
Shipman,
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you,

01:33:10.219 --> 01:33:13.154
and I'm gonna film
the whole fuckin' thing.

01:33:13.156 --> 01:33:15.222
You fuckin' hear me?

01:33:15.224 --> 01:33:17.391
I'm gonna slice
your fuckin' throat.

01:33:19.995 --> 01:33:21.762
<i>Alabama!</i>

01:33:22.431 --> 01:33:24.732
Alabama, you can't do this.

01:33:24.734 --> 01:33:27.001
<i>Alabama!</i>

01:33:27.003 --> 01:33:30.104
Shipman, I'm gonna fuck you up
for what you did to me.

01:33:30.106 --> 01:33:31.672
You hear me?
You fuckin' hear me?

01:33:31.674 --> 01:33:32.974
Sound.

01:33:34.676 --> 01:33:36.210
Speed.

01:33:39.048 --> 01:33:41.215
Runnin', Shooter?

01:33:41.217 --> 01:33:42.483
Speed.

01:33:43.652 --> 01:33:45.353
<i>Shipman!</i>

01:33:46.923 --> 01:33:49.256
<i>You better remember,
you fuckin' asshole.</i>

01:33:49.258 --> 01:33:50.257
No!

01:33:50.259 --> 01:33:51.158
<i>Fuck you.</i>

01:33:52.305 --> 01:33:58.374
