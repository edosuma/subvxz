00:06.841 --> 00:08.540
- ¶

00:08.542 --> 00:09.908
- [lasers zapping]
- Ah!

00:09.910 --> 00:11.343
- [lasers zapping]
- Ow!

00:11.345 --> 00:13.579
- NORA:
Faster! Faster!

00:13.581 --> 00:14.747
- Barb, it's like
you predicted.

00:14.749 --> 00:17.649
Nora's gone mad
with power.

00:17.651 --> 00:20.586
- No, no, no, she's
helping us stay focused.

00:20.588 --> 00:21.920
Ow!

00:21.922 --> 00:22.521
Thank you.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.923
We're trying to get Cheyanne
to come to our high school.

00:24.925 --> 00:27.926
- Oh, yes, Cheyanne,
the, uh, really famous person

00:27.928 --> 00:30.729
the kids love because
she is a famous...

00:30.731 --> 00:33.399
- Singer.
- ...singer.

00:33.401 --> 00:34.600
- Cheyanne's holding
a contest.

00:34.602 --> 00:36.035
She'll do a live
performance on Chirper

00:36.037 --> 00:38.437
at whichever school sends
her the most chirps.

00:38.439 --> 00:39.905
- Yeah, we gave Billy
a bunch of spaz berries

00:39.907 --> 00:42.541
to get him to chirp faster,
but it didn't go so well.

00:42.543 --> 00:45.144
- BILLY: [zooming]
- Hi, Billy. Bye, Billy.

00:47.681 --> 00:49.081
[gasps]
Time's up!

00:49.083 --> 00:50.783
They're tallying
up the chirps.

00:50.785 --> 00:51.817
- Well, I hope you win.

00:51.819 --> 00:53.452
- Yeah, and so do
two young girls,

00:53.454 --> 00:56.121
who not long ago came up with
a list of dream selfies.

00:56.123 --> 00:59.591
- And those girls...
were us.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.527
Also, those girls,
and those girls,

01:01.529 --> 01:02.561
they're all us.

01:02.563 --> 01:05.064
- We've gotten almost
every selfie on the list.

01:05.066 --> 01:06.698
Duck face with a duck.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.033
Fish face with a fish.

01:08.035 --> 01:10.769
- Selfie at Selfie Mountain.

01:10.771 --> 01:12.704
- She means Mount Rushmore.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.573
There's only one
selfie missing--

01:14.575 --> 01:15.307
the celebrity selfie.

01:15.309 --> 01:17.676
That's why I'm trying
to get Cheyanne here.

01:17.678 --> 01:18.744
- Let's see if we won.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.846
- [gurgling tone]
- What?

01:20.848 --> 01:22.948
My chirps didn't
go through.

01:22.950 --> 01:23.849
- Mine, either.

01:23.851 --> 01:27.419
- Sorry, sometimes my lasers
mess with cellphones.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.088
Well, this has
been fun. Bye!

01:29.090 --> 01:32.191
- Oh, sorry you lost
your contest.

01:32.193 --> 01:34.827
But I do know
two celebrities

01:34.829 --> 01:35.861
who would be
more than happy

01:35.863 --> 01:39.932
to put on their duck faces
for your final selfie.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.669
- Awww...how do
I put this?

01:43.671 --> 01:45.137
No.

01:46.073 --> 01:46.905
So, who did win?

01:46.907 --> 01:49.441
- It says Hiddenville High.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.210
I wish we went
to that school.

01:51.212 --> 01:52.611
- Cherry, we do.

01:52.613 --> 01:53.879
Four million chirps?

01:53.881 --> 01:55.114
How did we get
that many?

01:55.116 --> 01:59.651
- Because of Cheyanne's
future boyfriend.

01:59.653 --> 02:02.754
Harry Styles?
- No, me!

02:02.756 --> 02:05.624
I hacked Chirper and got
us all the votes.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.026
I also hacked
the Thunder monitor.

02:08.028 --> 02:09.528
- FEMALE VOICE:
Alert! Alert!

02:09.530 --> 02:12.598
Max is my master now.

02:12.766 --> 02:14.933
- Once Cheyanne sees me,
she'll fall so hard

02:14.935 --> 02:16.068
that she'll break a tooth,

02:16.070 --> 02:17.469
and then I'll
keep dating her,

02:17.471 --> 02:19.071
even though she
has a weird tooth.

02:19.073 --> 02:21.673
We're gonna have
an amazing life together.

02:21.675 --> 02:26.778
- [romantic classical music]

02:26.780 --> 02:31.116
- Thanks for loving me
and my weird tooth, Max.

02:31.118 --> 02:34.586
- Anything for you,
popstar wife Cheyanne.

02:36.123 --> 02:37.723
Welcome home.

02:37.725 --> 02:40.058
- CHEYANNE:
[screams]

02:42.163 --> 02:44.997
- So, your dream is to marry
your celebrity crush

02:44.999 --> 02:47.933
and live in
your parents' basement?

02:47.935 --> 02:48.667
- No!

02:48.669 --> 02:51.803
We'll spend our summers
in the garage.

02:51.805 --> 02:56.575
- ¶

02:56.577 --> 02:59.611
- Okay, Chloe, our Splat
Castle is complete.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.847
- Time to slay
the nasty dragon!

03:01.849 --> 03:03.815
- I probably should
be telling you

03:03.817 --> 03:05.984
not to play with
your food.

03:05.986 --> 03:08.587
But I kinda wanna
see if the fry knight

03:08.589 --> 03:09.688
saves the pickle princess.

03:09.690 --> 03:15.894
- Oh, my gosh, the Hairwear Pop
Up is coming to Hiddenville!

03:15.896 --> 03:17.829
- The hair what now?

03:17.831 --> 03:19.231
- It's like a temporary
store that sells

03:19.233 --> 03:23.569
hats, headbands and bows--
lots and lots of bows.

03:23.571 --> 03:26.705
- Oh, well, I have been in
the market for a new sun visor.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.740
It blocks the sun
from my face,

03:28.742 --> 03:30.542
but leaves my head
free to breathe!

03:30.544 --> 03:35.180
- Yeah, your last eight
went mysteriously missing.

03:35.749 --> 03:38.984
- Nora, will you help
me buy my first bow?

03:38.986 --> 03:39.651
- [gasps]

03:39.653 --> 03:43.322
I've been waiting your whole
life for you to say that.

03:43.324 --> 03:46.692
- Yay, it's my
bow-mitzvah!

03:47.695 --> 03:50.929
- Now our castle looks
like it needs some ketchup.

03:50.931 --> 03:52.931
I'll go get some.

03:52.933 --> 03:53.765
- Mmm!

03:53.767 --> 03:57.236
- Dad, don't eat
the pickle princess.

03:58.672 --> 04:02.741
- Stace, look, her ketchup
pumping game is flawless.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.843
- And so is her bow game.

04:04.845 --> 04:06.011
- BOTH:
Yas!

04:06.013 --> 04:08.947
- I don't know if you
know I can hear you,

04:08.949 --> 04:10.082
but I can.

04:10.084 --> 04:12.584
- She's throwing shade.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.253
I love her.

04:14.255 --> 04:16.221
- I'm Stacie.
This is Heather.

04:16.223 --> 04:17.923
- I'm Nora and I
know who you are.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.758
You're the girls
who made headbands

04:19.760 --> 04:21.193
and fedoras cool again.

04:21.195 --> 04:22.127
Big fan.

04:22.129 --> 04:23.762
- Wait. Lightbulb!
Brilliant!

04:23.764 --> 04:26.732
We should all go to
the Hairwear Pop Up tomorrow.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.300
- You guys wanna
hang out with me?

04:28.302 --> 04:30.936
- Headbands,
fedoras, bows.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.738
It just makes sense.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.172
- That would be great.

04:34.174 --> 04:37.309
Oh, my gosh, are we
becoming a squad?

04:37.311 --> 04:39.111
- BOTH:
Yas!

04:39.113 --> 04:41.280
- Oh, wait.
I just remembered.

04:41.282 --> 04:45.250
I promised I'd go to
that pop up with my sister.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.186
But maybe I can
bring her along--

04:48.188 --> 04:50.155
- Hold on. Pause.
Full stop.

04:50.157 --> 04:53.058
You wanna hang out
with your little sister?

04:53.060 --> 04:54.192
- Yeah.

04:54.194 --> 04:55.994
- BOTH:
Dislike!

04:55.996 --> 04:59.131
- Nora, hanging with us
is hanging with friends.

04:59.133 --> 05:00.098
Hanging with your
little sister

05:00.100 --> 05:02.000
is just babysitting
for free.

05:02.002 --> 05:04.069
- It's okay. Maybe
she doesn't wanna become

05:04.071 --> 05:06.371
part of a fashion
forward trio.

05:06.373 --> 05:07.205
- No! I do.

05:07.207 --> 05:11.977
I can babysit my sister
whenever, for money, obvi.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.112
- So, is that a yes?

05:14.114 --> 05:15.280
- No.

05:15.282 --> 05:17.249
It's a "Yas!"

05:17.251 --> 05:18.350
- BOTH:
Yas!

05:18.352 --> 05:19.951
- ALL:
[giggling]

05:19.953 --> 05:22.688
- [lively music playing]

05:22.690 --> 05:24.856
- Oh.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.058
Sweet!

05:26.060 --> 05:27.759
You finally wrote
a theme song

05:27.761 --> 05:29.861
to play every time
I enter a room.

05:29.863 --> 05:32.097
- It's not for you.
It's for me.

05:32.099 --> 05:34.800
Now that you're good,
I'm rusty at being evil.

05:34.802 --> 05:37.069
So, I'm following
my other passion.

05:37.071 --> 05:38.837
- I thought you gave
up on space travel

05:38.839 --> 05:41.707
'cause the suit
made you look fat.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.175
- No, music!

05:43.177 --> 05:45.711
I'm gonna be
a world-famous DJ.

05:45.713 --> 05:47.145
- You can't be a DJ.

05:47.147 --> 05:48.146
You have no thumbs.

05:48.148 --> 05:50.982
- You think I need
thumbs to do this?

05:50.984 --> 05:54.720
[record scratching]

05:54.722 --> 05:56.121
- Not bad.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.222
Needs thumbs.

05:57.224 --> 05:59.891
- Why can't you
support me?

05:59.893 --> 06:02.828
- Because I have
bigger things going on.

06:02.830 --> 06:05.764
That reminds me--
it is time.

06:08.302 --> 06:13.038
- Is that your celebrity
crush body spray kit?

06:13.040 --> 06:13.505
- Yep.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.407
Cheyanne's gonna be performing
at my school tomorrow,

06:15.409 --> 06:18.410
and she won't be able to resist
me while I'm wearing...

06:18.412 --> 06:20.011
[imitates spraying]

06:20.013 --> 06:22.180
Beast Musk!

06:23.884 --> 06:24.916
- Cheyanne?

06:24.918 --> 06:27.819
I can make a special
remix of her latest hit.

06:27.821 --> 06:29.921
You could give it
to her in person.

06:29.923 --> 06:30.856
This is my dream!

06:30.858 --> 06:33.258
- But if she listens to
it and doesn't like it,

06:33.260 --> 06:34.025
it could ruin my dream

06:34.027 --> 06:37.429
of marrying her on
a party submarine.

06:37.431 --> 06:40.132
- Please, Max,
I'm begging you.

06:40.134 --> 06:42.167
At least make
it your ringtone.

06:42.169 --> 06:43.735
Maybe she'll hear it.

06:43.737 --> 06:44.903
- Hmmm...

06:44.905 --> 06:46.338
Fine.
- Woo!

06:46.340 --> 06:47.906
- [bottle shatters]

06:47.908 --> 06:50.509
- Whoops, now this
place is gonna be

06:50.511 --> 06:54.146
lousy with lady beasts.

06:54.148 --> 06:58.116
- ¶

06:58.118 --> 06:59.985
- Okay, Cheyanne is
upstairs getting ready

06:59.987 --> 07:01.219
for her performance
tonight.

07:01.221 --> 07:03.054
We get up there,
we get our selfie.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.790
- And I get my steps in--

07:04.792 --> 07:07.325
currently at, uh, three.

07:08.362 --> 07:10.495
- Hi, we were hoping
to meet Cheyanne.

07:10.497 --> 07:11.963
- No.

07:11.965 --> 07:13.198
- Phoebe, allow me.

07:13.200 --> 07:16.034
I speak fluent "bodyguard."

07:16.036 --> 07:19.137
Hey, pepper spray!
- No!

07:21.108 --> 07:22.474
- Hey, why are you
letting them in?

07:22.476 --> 07:24.476
- Because they're
Cheyanne's dancers--

07:24.478 --> 07:28.847
and you two are givin'
off a strong weirdo vibe.

07:28.849 --> 07:30.215
- Now what?
- I don't know.

07:30.217 --> 07:31.883
Trick the security
guard into thinking

07:31.885 --> 07:33.885
that we're Cheyanne's
background dancers,

07:33.887 --> 07:36.321
so she lets us in?
- That would be wrong.

07:36.323 --> 07:39.424
But it would also probably
work, so let's do it.

07:39.426 --> 07:40.158
- Yay!

07:40.160 --> 07:42.828
- Come on, let's
practice our moves.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.129
- Oh, ho, ho.
Let me guess.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.431
You two got rejected
for meeting Cheyanne.

07:46.433 --> 07:48.967
- Okay, for your information,
that is not what happened.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.870
- Yeah, it is.
- A-meh, meh, moo.

07:52.539 --> 07:56.842
- Hey, I'm so sorry
about them.

07:56.844 --> 07:58.543
Anyway, I'm here
to see Cheyanne.

07:58.545 --> 07:59.911
Yeah, I'm the whole reason

07:59.913 --> 08:01.847
the school won
the Chirper contest.

08:01.849 --> 08:04.115
- Oh, you're the reason?
- Yeah.

08:04.117 --> 08:05.383
- No!

08:05.385 --> 08:08.920
- Okay, fine.
I understand.

08:11.058 --> 08:13.291
Nothing can keep
me from my bae!

08:13.293 --> 08:15.560
Oh!
[heavy thud]

08:17.998 --> 08:19.965
Cheyanne and I will
not be inviting you

08:19.967 --> 08:22.133
to our submarine wedding.

08:23.904 --> 08:26.171
- COLOSSO's VOICE: [ringtone]
DJ Colosso!

08:26.173 --> 08:29.341
- ¶ You gotta believe
in what you are ¶

08:29.343 --> 08:31.276
- Oh, why'd I let him
change my ringtone?

08:31.278 --> 08:32.544
This remix is
the worst thing ever.

08:32.546 --> 08:36.014
- That remix
is the best thing ever!

08:36.016 --> 08:37.549
- It's Cheyanne!
Be cool, Max.

08:37.551 --> 08:39.885
Work the Beast Musk.

08:39.887 --> 08:40.886
- Whoever DJ Colosso is,

08:40.888 --> 08:43.355
I've gotta meet him,
like yesterday.

08:43.357 --> 08:45.290
- Well, you're in luck...

08:45.292 --> 08:47.893
because I know
DJ Colosso.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.594
[laughing]

08:49.596 --> 08:53.999
That is me!
[laughing]

08:54.001 --> 08:56.067
- ¶

08:56.069 --> 08:57.135
¶ What you see ¶

08:57.137 --> 08:58.336
¶ Is not what you get ¶

08:58.338 --> 09:02.007
¶ Livin' our lives
with a secret ¶

09:02.009 --> 09:03.475
¶ We fit right in ¶

09:03.477 --> 09:04.910
¶ Bet you never guessed ¶

09:04.912 --> 09:06.444
¶ 'Cause we're
livin' our lives ¶

09:06.446 --> 09:08.179
¶ Just like all the rest ¶

09:08.181 --> 09:10.048
¶ A picture
perfect family ¶

09:10.050 --> 09:11.950
¶ Is what we try to be ¶

09:11.952 --> 09:13.385
¶ Look closer,
you might see ¶

09:13.387 --> 09:14.986
¶ The crazy things we do ¶

09:14.988 --> 09:16.922
¶ This isn't
make believe ¶

09:16.924 --> 09:18.323
¶ It's our reality ¶

09:18.325 --> 09:19.457
¶ Just your average family ¶

09:19.459 --> 09:23.061
¶ Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble ¶

09:23.063 --> 09:27.332
¶ Livin' a double life ¶¶

09:29.937 --> 09:31.269
- Let's get to
the Hairwear Pop Up

09:31.271 --> 09:34.105
before all the cool
sun visors are gone.

09:34.107 --> 09:35.206
- Girls, come on!

09:35.208 --> 09:39.344
Your father wants to pay
full price for half a hat.

09:39.346 --> 09:40.078
- [whooshing]

09:40.080 --> 09:43.315
- Oh, someone looks like
she's ready for her first bow.

09:43.317 --> 09:47.085
- And maybe ready for
her first visor, huh?

09:47.087 --> 09:48.253
- Uh, sure.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.188
[silently]
No.

09:50.691 --> 09:54.259
- Bad news, guys.
I can't go to the pop up.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.927
I have scalp mites.

09:55.929 --> 09:58.597
- Scalp mites? Ewwww!

09:58.599 --> 10:01.099
I mean,
how are you feeling?

10:01.101 --> 10:04.202
- Mostly worried that they're
gonna be at the pop up,

10:04.204 --> 10:06.504
which is why you guys
should get outta here,

10:06.506 --> 10:09.140
and do something else
with the rest of your day.

10:09.142 --> 10:10.508
- But what about
our bows?

10:10.510 --> 10:12.177
- We can get bows
another time.

10:12.179 --> 10:14.079
I'm sure another pop up
will pop up.

10:14.081 --> 10:16.948
That's why they're
called pop ups.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.250
Well, I'll see you guys
in four to six hours

10:19.252 --> 10:22.954
after whatever non-pop up
activity you choose.

10:22.956 --> 10:23.521
- Bye, Nora.

10:23.523 --> 10:26.524
- Ah! She knows we love her.
Let's just go.

10:26.693 --> 10:28.593
- Feel better.
- See ya.

10:28.595 --> 10:30.095
- [door closes]

10:30.097 --> 10:31.696
- I do now.

10:33.667 --> 10:36.701
- ¶

10:36.703 --> 10:38.003
- Hey, Colosso.

10:38.005 --> 10:39.671
- BILLY:
[zooming]

10:39.673 --> 10:40.739
- Hey, Billy.

10:40.741 --> 10:44.109
- Max! Max!
I called you six times.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.277
Any chance Cheyanne
heard my ringtone?

10:46.279 --> 10:49.147
- She sure did.
- And?

10:49.149 --> 10:51.349
- She hated it.

10:51.351 --> 10:52.684
- What?

10:52.686 --> 10:53.284
Great.

10:53.286 --> 10:55.987
Music's the only thing
I love as much as being evil,

10:55.989 --> 10:57.555
and I can't even
do that right.

10:57.557 --> 10:59.424
- Oh, come on, buddy.
It's not true.

10:59.426 --> 11:01.259
You take bad news
really well.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.628
- [sobbing]
No, I don't!

11:03.630 --> 11:05.597
[sobbing]

11:06.733 --> 11:08.733
- Max, you're super judgy.

11:08.735 --> 11:11.302
We're trying to be
Cheyanne's back-up dancers.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.438
Tell us what you think.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.440
- [lively music playing]

11:15.442 --> 11:18.510
- Five, six, seven, eight!

11:18.512 --> 11:20.278
- ¶

11:20.280 --> 11:22.313
- CHERRY:
Woo! Oh!

11:22.315 --> 11:23.348
[groans]

11:23.350 --> 11:27.052
Next time, let's take
it from the bottom.

11:27.054 --> 11:28.420
- Guys, just face it.

11:28.422 --> 11:29.421
You're never
gonna meet Cheyanne.

11:29.423 --> 11:33.224
I, on the other hand,
totally hit it off with her.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.326
- Really?
You met Cheyanne?

11:35.328 --> 11:35.827
- Uh-huh.

11:35.829 --> 11:38.596
She even took my digits.
- [cellphone ringing]

11:38.598 --> 11:40.765
- [gasps]
It's her! She's calling!

11:40.767 --> 11:42.367
Quiet! I'm being cool.

11:42.369 --> 11:46.237
Hey, Cheyanne.
[laughs] S'up?

11:46.239 --> 11:47.238
- Hey!

11:47.240 --> 11:48.373
- He's talking to Cheyanne.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.508
- I have got popstar
problems.

11:50.510 --> 11:53.445
My DJ accidentally
glued his hands together.

11:53.447 --> 11:56.815
- What?
That's so crazy.

11:56.817 --> 11:59.451
[quietly]
I did it.

11:59.453 --> 12:02.620
So, I guess that means
you need a new DJ.

12:02.622 --> 12:03.521
- Exactly.

12:03.523 --> 12:05.056
You already mixed my song,

12:05.058 --> 12:07.125
so, we can just
do that version.

12:07.127 --> 12:08.593
- Oh, no problem.

12:08.595 --> 12:09.728
It's so weird.

12:09.730 --> 12:12.263
It's like the universe
wants us to be together.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.666
[quietly]
I'm the universe.

12:15.602 --> 12:18.636
- Thank you so much.
You're really saving me.

12:18.638 --> 12:20.238
Smooches!
[blows kiss]

12:20.240 --> 12:21.773
- Smooche--
Oh, she hung up.

12:21.775 --> 12:24.442
But you heard her.
We're smoochin'.

12:24.444 --> 12:25.443
- Max, this is perfect.

12:25.445 --> 12:26.811
Now that you're
Cheyanne's DJ,

12:26.813 --> 12:29.247
you could help us
get a selfie with her.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.815
- Yeah, I could do that.

12:30.817 --> 12:31.583
Or I could do this.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.585
¶ Cheyanne and Max
are smoochin' ¶

12:33.587 --> 12:35.520
¶ Cheyanne and Max
are smoochin' ¶

12:35.522 --> 12:37.388
- Phoebe, this is awful.

12:37.390 --> 12:38.590
We're never gonna learn
Cheyanne's moves

12:38.592 --> 12:40.792
in time to pass
as her dancers.

12:40.794 --> 12:42.127
- Cherry, these two girls

12:42.129 --> 12:44.162
started off with
a cellphone and a dream.

12:44.164 --> 12:45.530
We can't let
them down.

12:45.532 --> 12:46.531
- Well, we're about to,

12:46.533 --> 12:48.533
unless you've got
some magic shoes

12:48.535 --> 12:49.334
that can help us dance.

12:49.336 --> 12:51.669
Actually, do you, because
that could really help us.

12:51.671 --> 12:55.540
- No, Cherry, I don't have
any magic dancing shoes.

12:55.542 --> 12:59.144
But I do know an evil master
of fashion who might.

12:59.146 --> 13:02.580
- I could build you
magic dancing shoes.

13:02.582 --> 13:04.382
But I won't!

13:04.384 --> 13:06.184
- I thought you
might say that,

13:06.186 --> 13:08.286
which is why
we brought you...

13:08.288 --> 13:09.788
tiny formalwear.

13:09.790 --> 13:12.857
- Oooh! Ahhhh!

13:12.859 --> 13:14.192
- Where are
the white gloves?

13:14.194 --> 13:17.428
Where's the cummerbund?
You brought me nothing!

13:17.430 --> 13:20.598
- Wow, Max really cares
about DJ'ing nowadays, huh?

13:20.600 --> 13:23.401
- Correction.
I'm the DJ of this lair.

13:23.403 --> 13:26.538
At least, I was until
my dreams got crushed.

13:26.540 --> 13:28.439
- Well, Max is saying
he's the DJ.

13:28.441 --> 13:30.208
He just talked to
Cheyanne about

13:30.210 --> 13:32.277
playing his remix
for her performance.

13:32.279 --> 13:34.445
- He took credit
for my remix?

13:34.447 --> 13:35.280
That liar!

13:35.282 --> 13:38.349
I'm so mad, I'm gonna
destroy this room!

13:38.351 --> 13:40.451
[grunting]

13:40.453 --> 13:44.322
Uh, imagine things
are more torn apart.

13:44.324 --> 13:48.426
- Hey, uh, Colosso, why don't
Cherry and I trash this room

13:48.428 --> 13:52.163
in exchange for you building
us some dance shoes?

13:52.165 --> 13:53.198
- Deal!

13:53.200 --> 13:55.600
- [objects clattering]

13:55.602 --> 13:59.170
- You moron,
that was my shelf.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.939
Ah!

14:02.876 --> 14:04.742
- Blue fedora
or orange fedora?

14:04.744 --> 14:06.611
- Both!
- ALL: Yas!

14:06.613 --> 14:08.713
- Oh, gee, Nora, we
haven't had this much fun

14:08.715 --> 14:11.883
with someone who
isn't us in forevs.

14:11.885 --> 14:15.320
- Aren't you glad you didn't
bring your baby sister?

14:17.257 --> 14:18.656
- Uh-oh.

14:19.226 --> 14:20.892
- Look, Mommy,
there's bows over there.

14:20.894 --> 14:25.897
- Nora, is this adorable
or dead ugly?

14:25.899 --> 14:27.232
Hey, where'd she go?

14:27.234 --> 14:32.337
- I don't know, but I think
that hat's from last season.

14:32.339 --> 14:33.571
- Ew!

14:33.573 --> 14:35.406
- BARB: Chloe,
it is so sweet of you

14:35.408 --> 14:36.307
to risk getting scalp mites,

14:36.309 --> 14:38.376
so you can buy a bow
for you and Nora.

14:38.378 --> 14:41.679
If I see one person scratch,
we are outta here.

14:41.681 --> 14:44.582
- Actually, Barb,
the place looks clear.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.517
Which means
it's visor time!

14:46.519 --> 14:51.623
I'm gonna go find a supervisor
to help me find a super visor.

14:51.625 --> 14:57.795
- Oh, I hate his hats,
but I love his jokes.

14:57.797 --> 15:02.367
- ¶

15:02.369 --> 15:03.034
- Hey, DJ Colosso.

15:03.036 --> 15:04.802
I just wanted to make
sure the turntables

15:04.804 --> 15:06.738
and mixers are up
to your standards.

15:06.740 --> 15:09.674
- [laughing]
Totally turny and mixy.

15:09.676 --> 15:11.743
- Great! Well,
I've gotta get ready.

15:11.745 --> 15:13.244
Big show tonight.

15:13.246 --> 15:16.447
- Do you wanna live
in a basement?

15:16.449 --> 15:19.550
Uh...I mean...uh...

15:19.552 --> 15:21.319
hang out later?

15:21.321 --> 15:23.254
- Uh, cool. It's a date.

15:23.256 --> 15:23.721
- It is?

15:23.723 --> 15:25.957
- As long as you don't
mess up my performance.

15:25.959 --> 15:26.824
- BOTH:
[laugh]

15:26.826 --> 15:29.694
- For real, though, millions
of people will be watching.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.896
Don't blow it!

15:32.766 --> 15:34.032
- I won't.
[laughs]

15:34.034 --> 15:37.568
I just have to figure
out how to fake DJ.

15:37.570 --> 15:40.638
- [feedback screeching]
- Not like that.

15:44.411 --> 15:47.812
- Okay. We'll probably never
see our old clothes again,

15:47.814 --> 15:49.580
but it's okay.

15:49.749 --> 15:51.349
- Tell me about these dancing
Colosso shoes again.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.685
- Okay, he built them to have
beat-absorbing technology,

15:53.687 --> 15:56.988
so, we can follow any
choreography and any song.

15:56.990 --> 15:57.855
Let's do it.

15:57.857 --> 16:00.458
- Excuse us, background
dancers comin' through.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.527
- Stop!
- Oh!

16:02.529 --> 16:04.295
- You don't belong
up there.

16:04.297 --> 16:07.465
- [laughs] Tell that
to our dance moves.

16:07.467 --> 16:10.935
- [lively music playing]
- [electrical zapping]

16:16.843 --> 16:20.011
- You've got five seconds...

16:20.013 --> 16:24.449
to get up there
and share your gift.

16:28.421 --> 16:31.022
- Sorry, girls, but the only
selfie you'll get today

16:31.024 --> 16:36.494
is of me using those shoes
to get revenge on Max.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.930
[evil laughter]

16:41.701 --> 16:44.302
- ¶

16:44.304 --> 16:46.738
- Oh, yes, I'd like to make
a reservation tonight

16:46.740 --> 16:47.872
for me and my girlfriend.

16:47.874 --> 16:50.074
Oh, also, do you know
how to make that

16:50.076 --> 16:52.977
wiki-wiki-wiki sound
on a turntable?

16:52.979 --> 16:54.612
Hello?

16:54.614 --> 16:57.382
- All right, time to
test out these shoes

16:57.384 --> 16:58.583
with a little bunny hop.

16:58.585 --> 17:01.452
- [electrical zapping]
- CHERRY: Whoa! Whoa!

17:01.454 --> 17:02.620
- MAX:
Oh!

17:02.622 --> 17:05.490
Hey! You coulda messed
with my beat match,

17:05.492 --> 17:07.759
or my cross fade or...

17:07.761 --> 17:10.328
other DJ words.

17:10.330 --> 17:12.630
- Cherry, I don't know
why you kicked Max,

17:12.632 --> 17:15.033
but nice job.

17:15.035 --> 17:17.402
All right, stay focused.

17:17.404 --> 17:19.737
Oh, there's Cheyanne.

17:19.739 --> 17:22.607
- Ooh, she's so Cheyanne-y.

17:22.609 --> 17:25.743
- Dancers, bring it in
for the spirit circle.

17:25.745 --> 17:29.881
- You know, um, my spirit
is asking for a selfie.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.349
- So is my spirit.

17:31.351 --> 17:33.618
Ooooh, I need a selfie.

17:33.620 --> 17:37.355
- Hey, Cheyanne, why don't you
like take a selfie with us?

17:37.357 --> 17:38.823
- Sure, give me your phone.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.458
- BOTH:
It's happening!

17:40.460 --> 17:42.060
- So I can turn it off.

17:42.062 --> 17:44.529
- BOTH:
It's not happening.

17:44.531 --> 17:46.497
- This performance
isn't about selfies.

17:46.499 --> 17:49.400
It's about the millions of
fans that'll be watching us.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.936
- Could it be about
selfies afterwards?

17:51.938 --> 17:52.904
- Totally.

17:52.906 --> 17:55.406
- BOTH:
[squealing]

17:55.408 --> 17:57.675
- ¶

17:57.677 --> 18:00.511
- These aren't special
enough for Nora.

18:00.513 --> 18:01.546
- What do you mean, Chloe?

18:01.548 --> 18:02.647
- I wanna get
her the best bow,

18:02.649 --> 18:07.085
'cause she's the best
big sister ever, baby!

18:07.087 --> 18:08.786
- Awww...

18:08.788 --> 18:10.121
- Okay, well, we'll
keep looking

18:10.123 --> 18:14.392
until we find
the perfect bow for Nora.

18:15.095 --> 18:17.428
- There you are.
We found you a bow.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.496
It brings out our eyes,

18:18.498 --> 18:21.099
so when we stand next
to you, we totally pop.

18:21.101 --> 18:22.934
- Love it. Grateful.
New plan.

18:22.936 --> 18:26.404
Let's go to the mall
and buy hair stuff there.

18:26.406 --> 18:27.572
- Is this because
of your family?

18:27.574 --> 18:29.540
Don't worry,
they're clueless.

18:29.542 --> 18:30.708
- What do you
mean clueless?

18:30.710 --> 18:32.643
- It means we saw your family
and your little sister

18:32.645 --> 18:35.079
was all like... [baby talk]
I love my big sister.

18:35.081 --> 18:36.581
She's the best, baby!

18:36.583 --> 18:38.716
- She doesn't
sound like that.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.651
Actually, that was
pretty good.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.086
But she could be
anywhere having fun,

18:42.088 --> 18:43.988
and she chose to come
here for me.

18:43.990 --> 18:45.823
- Well, do you wanna
hang out with us

18:45.825 --> 18:48.726
or your...[baby talk]
baby sister?

18:50.730 --> 18:52.997
- You guys--
- BOTH: Yas!

18:52.999 --> 18:54.432
- --are awful!

18:54.434 --> 18:57.602
And that "Yas!"
thing you're doing is weird.

18:57.604 --> 19:00.905
It's "Yes" with an "e".

19:03.510 --> 19:04.642
- Look, Nora's here.

19:04.644 --> 19:07.612
- Hold on.
Are your scalp mites gone?

19:07.614 --> 19:08.679
- Yeah, I got rid of them

19:08.681 --> 19:10.848
to hang out with
my little sister.

19:10.850 --> 19:12.049
- Awww...

19:12.051 --> 19:14.752
- It's bow-mitzvah time!

19:14.754 --> 19:18.022
- Hey, guys,
I found a visor.

19:18.024 --> 19:18.756
Nora's here!

19:18.758 --> 19:22.226
Keep your mites away
from my visor!

19:24.164 --> 19:27.765
- Okay, we're going live
in three, two...

19:27.767 --> 19:30.935
- COLOSSO's VOICE:
DJ Colosso!

19:30.937 --> 19:35.506
- [lively music playing]

19:35.508 --> 19:36.073
¶ Hey ¶

19:36.075 --> 19:39.877
¶ You gotta believe
in what you are ¶

19:39.879 --> 19:43.881
¶ Get back on your feet
and try again ¶

19:43.883 --> 19:47.919
¶ You've gotta believe
in what you got ¶

19:47.921 --> 19:50.188
¶ Never stop believing ¶

19:50.190 --> 19:51.022
¶ Never stop ¶

19:51.024 --> 19:52.657
¶ Never stop believing ¶

19:52.659 --> 19:56.060
¶ You ooh ooh
are something special ¶

19:56.062 --> 19:58.062
¶ Never forget that ¶

19:58.064 --> 20:01.566
- Time for operation
Pop, Lock and Flop.

20:01.568 --> 20:05.203
- [electrical zapping]
- Ooh! Cherry!

20:05.205 --> 20:05.836
Cherry!

20:05.838 --> 20:07.972
I think there's something
wrong with my shoes.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.574
Maybe we should--whoa!

20:09.576 --> 20:11.008
- What are you doing?

20:11.010 --> 20:13.211
Keep dancing!
We're live!

20:13.213 --> 20:26.090
- ¶

20:26.092 --> 20:28.259
- COLOSSO's VOICE:
DJ Colosso! DJ Colosso!

20:28.261 --> 20:33.965
DJ Colosso! DJ Colosso!
DJ Colosso! DJ Colo--

20:33.967 --> 20:37.768
- You're not a DJ.
You're just a big fake.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.804
- Wait, Cheyanne,
we're supposed to be together,

20:39.806 --> 20:41.706
and live in my
parents' basement.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.574
- Get outta here, stinko.

20:43.576 --> 20:44.242
- What? Pam!

20:44.244 --> 20:47.178
I thought we were
friends! Pam!

20:48.014 --> 20:49.780
- As for you two...
- Hey, Cheyanne,

20:49.782 --> 20:51.682
I know we ruined
your million dollar live video,

20:51.684 --> 20:53.117
but we have this selfie
bucket list--

20:53.119 --> 20:55.886
- Get out of here!
- Okay, we're going!

20:56.723 --> 20:59.557
- ¶

20:59.559 --> 21:02.560
- Colosso, did you have
to make a cabbage patch

21:02.562 --> 21:05.296
through that cabbage patch?

21:05.298 --> 21:06.964
- Nice touch, bro.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.833
- Oh, so we're
bros again, huh?

21:08.835 --> 21:11.702
- Look, I'm sorry for
stealing your beats.

21:11.704 --> 21:14.238
The good news is you
don't need a DJ career,

21:14.240 --> 21:17.174
'cause you're still
an amazing evil mastermind.

21:17.176 --> 21:18.609
- Oh, thanks, Max.

21:18.611 --> 21:19.610
So, you're not mad at me

21:19.612 --> 21:21.045
for ruining your shot
with Cheyanne?

21:21.047 --> 21:24.282
- Of course, I am.
You're the worst.

21:24.284 --> 21:26.584
But I should
actually thank you,

21:26.586 --> 21:27.718
because now millions
of people are enjoying

21:27.720 --> 21:32.156
this video of Phoebe and Cherry
totally humiliating themselves.

21:32.158 --> 21:35.693
- [lively music playing]

21:36.729 --> 21:39.764
- Wait, Cherry, remember when
we were dancing uncontrollably,

21:39.766 --> 21:40.998
we bumped into the camera?

21:41.000 --> 21:42.733
- No, but that's
probably because

21:42.735 --> 21:44.869
I hit my head pretty hard.

21:46.005 --> 21:49.607
- Look at this--
my chin, your forehead,

21:49.609 --> 21:51.909
and way in the back,
a super angry Cheyanne.

21:51.911 --> 21:53.611
What does that
look like to you?

21:53.613 --> 21:56.080
- BOTH:
Celebrity selfie!

21:56.082 --> 21:57.782
- Hey, you did it.

21:57.784 --> 22:00.251
Celebration dance.

22:00.253 --> 22:02.053
- Whoa!

22:02.055 --> 22:03.154
Oh!

22:03.156 --> 22:04.889
Why didn't we take
these shoes off?

22:04.891 --> 22:06.957
- COLOSSO:

22:09.929 --> 22:22.173
