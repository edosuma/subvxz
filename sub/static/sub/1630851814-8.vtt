WEBVTT

00:50.800 --> 00:53.178
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED IN A DYSTOPIAN KOREA

00:53.261 --> 00:56.222
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

01:13.490 --> 01:16.659
Only the system allows
for such complete manipulation.

01:17.535 --> 01:18.912
This is called the system.

01:18.995 --> 01:21.539
And the system is powerless
in front of authority.

01:21.623 --> 01:25.335
It's the authority
that can wrap it around its finger.

02:58.303 --> 03:00.847
In that fire
that claimed my brother's life…

03:14.527 --> 03:16.946
<i>I understood how they scrambled</i>

03:18.031 --> 03:19.240
<i>to save themselves.</i>

03:20.033 --> 03:22.493
<i>They were just humans
acting like one, after all.</i>

03:22.577 --> 03:23.953
<i>It's typical of man.</i>

03:24.746 --> 03:27.665
But there was something
that really surprised me.

03:29.959 --> 03:33.004
Those very bastards came to the hospital.

03:41.012 --> 03:44.098
I honestly could have saved
your brother and his family,

03:44.182 --> 03:45.808
but those flames were just…

03:45.892 --> 03:48.811
Anyway, how did you make it
out of that living hell?

03:48.895 --> 03:51.272
Honestly, it's simply amazing.

03:51.356 --> 03:54.234
Yes, I thought I was going to be
swallowed up by those flames.

03:54.317 --> 03:56.194
The heavens helped us.

03:57.820 --> 03:58.863
As for me…

03:59.530 --> 04:02.450
All I could think about then
was my one and only son

04:03.451 --> 04:06.329
and how I'd never offered him
warm words of affection.

04:13.878 --> 04:17.173
I'm sorry about your brother,
but he will live on in our hearts.

04:18.299 --> 04:21.511
Which is why we should
continue on with his wishes.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.346
Your brother's wealth that he donated…

04:24.055 --> 04:26.557
The Foundation will make sure
every penny goes unwasted.

04:26.641 --> 04:28.726
With love, and with a giving hand.

04:28.810 --> 04:32.772
We should consider this
a second chance at life

04:32.855 --> 04:36.943
and really count our blessings,
being grateful for what we have.

04:37.026 --> 04:38.319
-Of course.
-We should, yes.

04:38.403 --> 04:41.489
We should share more, give more
and be more thankful.

04:41.572 --> 04:43.408
-So trust us.
-Amen.

04:43.491 --> 04:45.702
They say to always put yourself
in others' shoes,

04:45.785 --> 04:47.829
and we know just how you feel.

04:47.912 --> 04:51.165
Why wouldn't we? We were in the same boat
in that fiery chaos.

04:51.249 --> 04:53.918
Actually, we still are in one boat.
This is fate!

04:54.002 --> 04:55.378
Yes, you're absolutely right.

04:56.879 --> 04:59.507
There was no man like
your brother in this world.

04:59.590 --> 05:00.925
He was truly exceptional.

05:01.009 --> 05:02.343
We can't thank him enough.

05:02.427 --> 05:03.720
A remarkable man, he was.

05:04.762 --> 05:07.348
Look at the sun.
It's the perfect day for a picnic.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.686
<i>They meant every word of it,</i>

05:12.562 --> 05:13.980
<i>without an ounce of guilt.</i>

05:26.701 --> 05:29.662
And I just couldn't stand their hypocrisy.

05:30.955 --> 05:32.332
It was revolting.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.711
I bet they're still the same too.

05:36.794 --> 05:38.421
"What have we done wrong?"

05:39.380 --> 05:43.259
"This is a project to revive the economy,
and you're just nitpicking."

05:43.342 --> 05:44.969
"This is a political conspiracy."

05:45.053 --> 05:47.055
"We can't lose our footing."

06:03.071 --> 06:05.740
If there really is a devil in this world,

06:08.284 --> 06:09.327
it's probably…

06:12.246 --> 06:14.457
the have's indulging in self-pity.

06:53.663 --> 06:54.914
You're a mess.

06:56.332 --> 06:57.959
Just think about yourself for now

06:58.960 --> 07:00.628
and nothing else.

07:22.859 --> 07:26.654
Number 70618, Do Young-choon.

07:28.656 --> 07:30.575
Sir, why are you in there?

07:31.242 --> 07:33.202
Get out of there. Sir!

07:33.286 --> 07:34.412
Sir!

07:44.422 --> 07:46.299
-We are
-We are

07:46.382 --> 07:48.384
-the power!
-the power!

07:48.468 --> 07:50.219
-We are
-We are

07:50.303 --> 07:51.762
-the power!
-the power!

07:55.349 --> 07:56.976
<i>He'd use others' sufferings</i>

07:57.768 --> 07:59.604
<i>to achieve his purpose.</i>

08:06.777 --> 08:09.238
<i>That would be the devil
if it exists in this world.</i>

09:53.426 --> 09:56.178
I hear the staff at the SRF
have started to come forward too.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.268
<i>Anything useful so far?</i>

10:02.351 --> 10:04.061
There was one from the accounts team.

10:04.145 --> 10:05.104
<i>Oh, really?</i>

10:05.187 --> 10:08.816
She promised to call us back by yesterday,
but I still haven't heard from her.

10:09.483 --> 10:10.860
<i>Her phone is switched off too.</i>

10:11.694 --> 10:13.613
<i>I'm trying to see what's going on, but…</i>

10:15.031 --> 10:16.240
Let me call you back.

10:20.119 --> 10:23.581
The following are
Chairman Seo's last words

10:24.165 --> 10:25.750
for all of us.

10:30.421 --> 10:34.050
<i>My deepest apologies to our people.</i>

10:34.884 --> 10:36.552
<i>All blame lies with me</i>

10:37.386 --> 10:40.139
<i>and my carelessness
in underestimating the greed of man,</i>

10:40.806 --> 10:44.477
<i>in entrusting my subordinates
with too much authority,</i>

10:45.186 --> 10:48.272
<i>but most of all,
in trusting others too easily.</i>

10:48.981 --> 10:52.151
<i>All these are my mistakes,
which I realize are irreversible.</i>

10:53.653 --> 10:56.322
<i>I have no excuses to offer</i>

10:57.365 --> 10:59.659
<i>to all those
who have put their faith in me.</i>

11:01.369 --> 11:03.704
She's a bigger psycho than I thought.

11:06.290 --> 11:07.500
<i>As for me,</i>

11:08.751 --> 11:12.046
I'll go prepare a message for our people.

11:12.129 --> 11:13.839
While I do, get rid of her.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.133
-Make no mistakes.
-Sure.

11:16.217 --> 11:17.426
Then please excuse me.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.096
-You're not staying for dinner?
-You're off already?

11:20.179 --> 11:22.014
I'll leave the rest to you, gentlemen.

11:22.098 --> 11:23.849
Chairman! We'll trust you on this one!

11:23.933 --> 11:24.975
Good night, sir!

11:42.118 --> 11:44.078
Impressive, Director Jung.

11:44.161 --> 11:46.247
It's not just a year or two
that I served him.

11:47.915 --> 11:50.459
All right, then.

11:51.252 --> 11:52.586
Why should we…

11:53.546 --> 11:57.466
take up your offer
instead of Chairman Seo's?

11:57.550 --> 11:58.592
Let's hear it.

12:00.094 --> 12:02.012
But isn't it obvious?

12:03.055 --> 12:06.183
Chairman Seo is a highly respected person,
which is very rare.

12:06.892 --> 12:09.061
As he just said,

12:09.145 --> 12:11.856
one word from him to the public

12:11.939 --> 12:13.607
will change their sentiment.

12:17.695 --> 12:18.696
And?

12:20.948 --> 12:22.158
So what if

12:22.867 --> 12:26.537
those were his last words
before he took his own life?

12:27.246 --> 12:29.457
Imagine the weight they would carry.

12:30.207 --> 12:34.628
In other words, a dead Chairman Seo
has more value than a live one?

12:35.546 --> 12:37.590
Oh, you're so scary, Director Jung.

12:37.673 --> 12:41.385
I didn't know you could be so ruthless.
Honestly, I'm petrified.

12:41.469 --> 12:44.638
I'm petrified, and I like it.

12:44.722 --> 12:48.559
<i>All these are my mistakes,
which I realize are irreversible.</i>

12:49.351 --> 12:51.812
<i>I have no excuses to offer</i>

12:51.896 --> 12:54.106
<i>to all those
who have put their faith in me.</i>

12:54.190 --> 12:55.524
<i>From now on,</i>

12:56.525 --> 13:00.237
<i>I will directly oversee
all matters of the Foundation</i>

13:00.321 --> 13:03.115
from one to ten,
and assume all responsibilities.

13:04.074 --> 13:05.326
As a first step,

13:06.035 --> 13:08.329
I will weed out Jung Seon-a,

13:08.996 --> 13:11.916
<i>the criminal who laid her hands
on the donations,</i>

13:11.999 --> 13:14.043
and make sure that
she is rightfully punished for her sin.

13:14.710 --> 13:18.672
<i>Wherever she may be hiding…</i>

13:21.050 --> 13:22.384
<i>Jung Seon-a…</i>

13:23.052 --> 13:25.095
<i>the criminal who laid her hands…</i>

13:25.179 --> 13:28.432
<i>Wherever she may be hiding…
As a first step…</i>

13:33.145 --> 13:37.274
<i>My deepest apologies to our people.</i>

13:38.234 --> 13:39.568
All done!

13:40.986 --> 13:45.157
Chairman Seo, who lead a most
respectable life of no shame

13:46.492 --> 13:48.452
chose to bear the cross

13:49.119 --> 13:51.080
in place of our sinning employees,

13:51.163 --> 13:52.873
who are as follows.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.794
It's been revealed that

13:56.877 --> 14:00.172
they are the rebellious forces
who systematically infiltrated into us

14:00.714 --> 14:04.927
and erased all accounts data and fled
after suspicions turned to them.

14:06.095 --> 14:07.638
We will track them down

14:07.721 --> 14:09.348
<i>and make them pay,</i>

14:10.015 --> 14:11.934
<i>wherever they may be hiding…</i>

14:14.562 --> 14:16.564
Just what are they scheming?

14:18.440 --> 14:20.776
These are the people
who tried to reach out to us,

14:20.860 --> 14:22.278
and now they've been made the scapegoat.

14:22.361 --> 14:25.406
Their storyline is,
"We'd made the donations,

14:25.489 --> 14:26.949
but they embezzled the money."

14:27.032 --> 14:29.076
Then we should issue
a statement to refute--

14:29.159 --> 14:30.786
"That's terrible."

14:30.870 --> 14:31.954
"How cruel are they?

14:32.037 --> 14:33.247
And they're heartless."

14:34.123 --> 14:36.292
"How could they when someone's just died?"

14:38.127 --> 14:40.504
This country is extremely
sympathetic toward death.

14:41.630 --> 14:43.340
They'll use all forms of media

14:43.424 --> 14:45.801
to incite the mourning of
Seo Jeong-hak's death.

14:46.635 --> 14:49.763
So that no one dares to
challenge his last words.

14:49.847 --> 14:52.182
Turning crises into opportunities

14:52.266 --> 14:54.560
is how those who move the world operate.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.146
So watch and remember.

14:57.229 --> 15:00.107
<i>Surprisingly, the mastermind</i>

15:00.190 --> 15:04.361
behind those who went dark
after embezzling a huge sum

15:04.445 --> 15:08.490
were the extremists who had
instigated the Gwanghwamun Riot.

15:08.574 --> 15:09.992
But what's more surprising

15:10.075 --> 15:14.496
is that many of them were foreigners
without Korean citizenship!

15:14.580 --> 15:18.042
Perhaps, this is a conspiracy
by the external forces

15:19.209 --> 15:21.462
to try and unsettle our country.

15:21.545 --> 15:25.382
Our authorities have managed to arrest
some of them and started an investigation,

15:25.466 --> 15:28.052
but with a tremendous amount
trickled into their coffers,

15:28.135 --> 15:31.889
we are now in a state of emergency

15:31.972 --> 15:34.391
faced with terrorism and riots
at any time and place.

15:34.475 --> 15:36.393
And who is responsible for all this?

15:37.227 --> 15:40.356
Is it not the responsibility
of the previous government

15:40.439 --> 15:42.316
for their lousy measures against crime?

15:42.399 --> 15:46.820
But I will uproot these forces of evil,

15:46.904 --> 15:49.198
and restore law and order upon this land

15:49.281 --> 15:52.076
so that such tragedy is not repeated

15:52.159 --> 15:54.662
and to build a safe country.

15:55.454 --> 15:57.665
I promise you, with this declaration!

15:58.290 --> 16:00.751
My fellow Koreans,

16:00.834 --> 16:05.130
no longer will there be a Korea
who is weak

16:05.214 --> 16:07.967
and who fails to stand up
to the criminals.

16:08.050 --> 16:12.596
Together with Ms. Jung Seon-a,
our new chairwoman,

16:15.015 --> 16:20.646
we will build safe, and powerful Korea!

16:37.454 --> 16:38.580
Jung Seon-a!

16:44.294 --> 16:45.629
<i>What can we do against them</i>

16:45.713 --> 16:48.298
while adhering to
all principles and procedures?

16:52.177 --> 16:55.097
As I told you,
there is no justice in the real world.

16:55.180 --> 16:56.432
Only a game exists.

16:56.515 --> 16:59.768
A terribly tilted one at that.

17:01.603 --> 17:04.189
I know you're still in shock,
but pull yourself together.

17:05.899 --> 17:07.693
Because it looks like the main round

17:08.569 --> 17:09.653
has just begun.

17:54.490 --> 17:55.449
GANGSTER

18:00.829 --> 18:02.748
-Su-hyeon.
<i>-Hey, Ga-on.</i>

18:03.499 --> 18:04.708
<i>What's the time?</i>

18:04.792 --> 18:06.877
Did you miss me that much?

18:08.170 --> 18:09.713
-Yes.
-What?

18:11.215 --> 18:12.424
Yes.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.427
I miss you, Su-hyeon.

18:27.147 --> 18:30.067
You visited me in the hospital
every single day,

18:30.150 --> 18:32.528
so what's this about missing me?

18:33.278 --> 18:35.948
I said let's have a drink
once you're discharged.

18:36.031 --> 18:37.699
That's welcome any time.

18:37.783 --> 18:40.202
It was really tough staying dry, you know.

18:40.285 --> 18:41.370
It's all on me tonight.

18:42.955 --> 18:45.040
-I like your attitude.
-Right?

18:50.295 --> 18:51.547
It hurts.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.966
-What? Does it still hurt?
-Yes, my injuries.

18:54.049 --> 18:55.801
Oh, your injuries?

18:56.760 --> 18:58.846
Here. Let's go.

19:05.811 --> 19:07.479
-Su-hyeon.
-Yes?

19:07.563 --> 19:09.857
-By the way, didn't you injure your head?
-Shut up.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.275
Yes, ma'am.

19:14.403 --> 19:15.696
It tastes so sweet.

19:15.779 --> 19:17.614
Come on, bottoms up.

19:25.497 --> 19:26.999
So when are you going to tell me?

19:28.834 --> 19:31.795
-Tell you what?
-I know something bad happened.

19:31.879 --> 19:35.048
No, this really is to celebrate
your discharge.

19:36.466 --> 19:37.801
Ga-on.

19:44.391 --> 19:46.977
I just wanted to see you. That's all.

19:49.104 --> 19:50.480
Really…

19:54.985 --> 19:57.654
What? But how could that be?

19:58.363 --> 19:59.948
I saw it with my own two eyes.

20:00.699 --> 20:04.119
How can I ever forget his face?

20:04.203 --> 20:05.954
But how…

20:07.581 --> 20:10.626
But that's not something
the warden's capable of doing,

20:10.709 --> 20:12.211
or the regional commissioner.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.379
It has to be someone much higher up.

20:14.963 --> 20:17.883
Yes, that's what
Kang Yo-han is telling me.

20:18.592 --> 20:20.219
That is true,

20:20.302 --> 20:23.013
and it all fits perfectly…

20:24.389 --> 20:25.766
It just fits so perfectly.

20:25.849 --> 20:27.517
When I'm leading an investigation,

20:27.601 --> 20:30.562
I always doubt the stories
that seem to fit too well.

20:31.438 --> 20:33.357
What could be Kang Yo-han's intention?

20:34.149 --> 20:36.985
From how he knows so much about your past,

20:37.861 --> 20:39.821
and how he took you there

20:39.905 --> 20:42.532
to show you
that perfectly coordinated act…

20:44.534 --> 20:47.329
What if…

20:48.205 --> 20:49.498
all of his actions

20:50.415 --> 20:52.125
have an ulterior motive?

20:53.335 --> 20:57.047
What if he's trying to
shake you up to drag you into this?

21:03.053 --> 21:04.304
You're the bomb, Su-hyeon.

21:05.889 --> 21:07.516
I'll get to the bottom of all this.

21:08.433 --> 21:11.186
I'll find out just
who is responsible for all this.

21:12.354 --> 21:15.107
It will become an official investigation
if you step forward.

21:15.190 --> 21:18.735
But we can't trust your superiors,
nor anyone else out there.

21:18.819 --> 21:21.363
-Still…
-Give me some time.

21:21.989 --> 21:24.157
I'll play along with Kang Yo-han
in the meantime

21:24.241 --> 21:25.701
and look into it some more.

21:26.410 --> 21:27.327
All right?

21:45.679 --> 21:47.139
It's tough, isn't it?

21:53.979 --> 21:55.731
To be honest, I was quite impressed.

21:56.481 --> 21:58.400
I was quite shocked

21:58.483 --> 22:01.278
and impressed
by those who pulled off all this.

22:02.112 --> 22:03.238
Confidence?

22:03.322 --> 22:05.741
I don't think they were even
afraid of getting caught

22:05.824 --> 22:08.327
from how they didn't bother
looking for a similar face.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.080
My mom and dad…

22:14.416 --> 22:18.045
Despite all that had happened to them,

22:18.837 --> 22:20.714
I, their one and only son…

22:22.716 --> 22:24.801
had been totally oblivious to all this.

22:28.138 --> 22:29.347
And it's just so…

22:35.062 --> 22:36.688
Gosh, the music…

24:43.857 --> 24:47.569
Seon-a, good work.

24:50.572 --> 24:51.740
I love you.

25:00.498 --> 25:02.167
You're that proud of yourself?

25:03.668 --> 25:05.045
Of course.

25:05.712 --> 25:09.049
You would know
about how fervently I worked.

25:10.926 --> 25:15.388
I've come all the way till here
from that shitty place.

25:15.472 --> 25:18.600
Sure. I'll give it to you.

25:18.683 --> 25:21.019
You're truly remarkable.

25:24.814 --> 25:25.899
Really?

25:36.159 --> 25:37.535
That's right.

25:37.619 --> 25:40.664
Jung Seon-a is remarkable.

25:42.249 --> 25:44.167
So are you off somewhere?

25:45.835 --> 25:46.920
Yes.

25:48.755 --> 25:50.840
To Young Master.

26:00.517 --> 26:01.685
<i>Breaking news.</i>

26:01.768 --> 26:04.396
<i>President Heo Joong-se
continues to publish measures</i>

26:04.479 --> 26:06.815
<i>to reinforce law and order.</i>

26:06.898 --> 26:10.652
<i>He has also commended
the </i>Live Court Show<i> of…</i>

26:14.572 --> 26:15.782
Stretch your arms out.

26:15.865 --> 26:16.908
Arms out to the side.

26:22.163 --> 26:23.707
These are turbulent times.

26:24.291 --> 26:27.460
Apparently, there were orders
for tight controls from above.

26:28.670 --> 26:30.547
Just what is the world coming to?

26:33.883 --> 26:37.512
I guess Judge Kim has no idea because
he's too busy with more important affairs.

26:38.596 --> 26:40.140
While I've been made a fool.

26:40.223 --> 26:41.766
Judge Oh, you see…

26:41.850 --> 26:43.018
Forget it.

26:48.857 --> 26:51.484
<i>To expand the stronger penal system
first introduced</i>

26:51.568 --> 26:54.487
<i>by the Department of Live Court Show

26:54.571 --> 26:58.158
<i>the current guidelines will be revised

<i>of a support committee to assist and
promote the work of the </i>Live Court Show<i>.</i>

27:03.204 --> 27:04.205
Who is it?

27:09.919 --> 27:11.546
Hello, Young Master.

27:22.474 --> 27:23.808
Are you crazy?

27:24.601 --> 27:26.728
Who are you to just parade in here?

27:26.811 --> 27:27.854
It's nice to meet you.

27:28.646 --> 27:32.692
I'm Jung Seon-a, and I'll also be chairing
the Live Court Show Support Committee.

27:33.777 --> 27:36.404
I look forward to
working with you, Judge Kang.

27:49.667 --> 27:51.795
<i>This is a violation of
judicial independence.</i>

27:51.878 --> 27:54.547
Judges who deliver sentences
weaker than the new guidelines

27:54.631 --> 27:57.592
and who have a high warrant
rejection rate will be punished?

27:57.675 --> 28:00.261
The Blue House wants to
establish social discipline,

28:00.345 --> 28:01.930
so we should cooperate.

28:02.013 --> 28:05.058
Is that the purpose
of the Ministry of Justice?

28:05.141 --> 28:06.768
The nation must come first

28:06.851 --> 28:10.313
for there to be any judicial independence.

28:10.397 --> 28:12.273
For the nation to persist

28:12.357 --> 28:15.735
is why we have judicial independence,
Chief Justice.

28:24.369 --> 28:26.788
<i>Were you not satisfied
with the SRF chairwoman title?</i>

28:27.455 --> 28:28.540
Don't make me laugh.

28:29.207 --> 28:32.210
You are going to support me?

28:33.628 --> 28:34.879
You hurt my feelings.

28:34.963 --> 28:36.631
I really mean this, you know.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.093
You mean this?

28:40.176 --> 28:43.263
Of course. You're my savior, you know.

28:43.346 --> 28:45.181
You mean I stirred up your sheep farm

28:45.265 --> 28:47.350
so you could steal seats?

28:48.059 --> 28:49.144
Is that right?

28:49.227 --> 28:53.064
Well, that's one thing
but that's not all I owe you.

28:54.357 --> 28:56.276
It was at your place

28:57.110 --> 28:59.821
that I saw a beautiful world
for the first time in my life.

28:59.904 --> 29:02.031
Where everything shines so bright.

29:02.657 --> 29:05.201
I worked so hard to go back to it.

29:05.285 --> 29:07.954
Not as a petty thief, but as the owner.

29:09.873 --> 29:13.585
The owner of the world
you kicked me out of.

29:14.294 --> 29:15.837
You haven't changed one bit.

29:16.379 --> 29:20.467
Back then and now,
you're just a starved petty thief.

29:21.384 --> 29:24.429
A petty thief who doesn't even realize

29:24.512 --> 29:25.722
how broken she is.

29:32.228 --> 29:33.605
I…

29:35.565 --> 29:38.026
really find you charming
when you're like this.

29:39.652 --> 29:44.032
When you scoff at me,
curse at me, and hurt me.

29:44.908 --> 29:46.367
It's so thrilling.

29:47.035 --> 29:48.453
That's why I want to…

29:49.370 --> 29:50.914
bully you too.

29:52.207 --> 29:56.878
Scratch you, bite you,
and dig my nails into you…

30:01.925 --> 30:03.927
You still don't know me, do you?

30:04.010 --> 30:06.179
I don't have much patience

30:13.061 --> 30:15.355
and I don't discriminate
between men and women.

30:20.068 --> 30:21.319
I treat them…

30:28.326 --> 30:29.744
the same way.

30:34.415 --> 30:36.501
You're just like me, Young Master.

30:39.212 --> 30:40.505
Is that why you like me?

30:41.798 --> 30:42.924
Yes.

30:44.592 --> 30:46.010
How much do you like me?

30:51.182 --> 30:52.851
I asked how much do you like me?

31:10.076 --> 31:11.661
What do you think you're doing?

31:14.497 --> 31:15.540
Are you all right?

31:17.000 --> 31:18.459
I'm fine.

31:18.543 --> 31:19.794
I owe you my life.

31:21.254 --> 31:22.547
Oh, sure.

31:26.092 --> 31:27.385
Judge Kang, what…

31:29.554 --> 31:30.638
Please excuse me.

31:31.556 --> 31:32.932
I'll see you again.

31:46.863 --> 31:48.364
Damn it.

31:48.448 --> 31:52.035
She'll be chairing some support committee
for the Department of Live Court Show.

31:52.827 --> 31:53.953
Director Jung?

31:57.874 --> 31:59.626
Hello, Director Jung.

31:59.709 --> 32:03.087
Judge Oh! We need to talk.
Just the two of us.

32:08.801 --> 32:10.386
What is this?

32:19.062 --> 32:20.146
Judge Kang.

32:21.314 --> 32:23.107
Am I really part of the judging panel?

32:23.191 --> 32:24.525
What is this about?

32:24.609 --> 32:26.903
The entire country is in chaos
with what you started,

32:26.986 --> 32:29.030
but you still won't tell us anything.

32:29.113 --> 32:31.282
You once said you'd resign
without even giving us a hint

32:31.366 --> 32:33.493
and next you said you'd be receiving
tip-offs from the country.

32:33.576 --> 32:36.162
Then there's that woman. Why is she here?

32:36.245 --> 32:37.789
-Judge Oh.
-No.

32:37.872 --> 32:39.040
Let me finish.

32:42.293 --> 32:45.296
I don't know what you think of me,

32:45.380 --> 32:47.006
but I'm a judge of this country

32:47.090 --> 32:49.050
and a rightful member of
this judging panel.

32:49.133 --> 32:51.636
If this is how you'll be,
you can rule all by yourself.

32:51.719 --> 32:53.096
You've changed, Judge Oh.

32:53.930 --> 32:56.432
"If you'll invite me
to your judging panel,

32:56.516 --> 33:00.103
it'll be my honor,
just sitting by your side."

33:00.186 --> 33:03.022
Isn't that what you'd said?
That's what I remember.

33:03.106 --> 33:04.774
I see you've become quite ambitious.

33:05.441 --> 33:09.237
It sure is something to congratulate,
but may I ask what the impetus was?

33:09.320 --> 33:11.823
I've said all I need to.

33:25.169 --> 33:26.754
So this is your way, is it?

33:26.838 --> 33:29.257
How will you confront those
who move this world

33:29.340 --> 33:31.968
if you'll push out even those
who are beside you?

33:32.051 --> 33:33.386
You'll be left all alone.

33:35.930 --> 33:37.306
Let's come back to that later.

33:39.726 --> 33:40.810
Drop by my place.

33:41.853 --> 33:43.980
Elijah is getting restless.

33:47.775 --> 33:50.945
I'm being completely excluded
from all that's happening!

33:54.574 --> 33:56.784
All of a sudden, Seo Jeong-hak dies,

33:57.618 --> 33:59.495
and next, it's an extremist organization?

33:59.579 --> 34:02.165
Have you managed to identify
those who have been arrested?

34:02.248 --> 34:06.002
The NIS declined sharing any information
claiming it's their purview.

34:06.085 --> 34:07.962
Those bastards.

34:09.380 --> 34:12.175
So they'll only take orders
from the president, will they?

34:16.387 --> 34:19.057
About our team who's collecting
info against Heo Joong-se.

34:19.640 --> 34:20.516
Yes, Minister Cha.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.727
Redirect some of them
to another figure for the time being.

34:22.810 --> 34:24.312
Who, exactly?

34:28.107 --> 34:31.360
Jung Seon-a,
the new chairwoman of the SRF.

34:33.446 --> 34:36.157
It seems our puppet president

34:36.741 --> 34:39.494
has been charmed by a nine-tailed fox.

34:58.346 --> 35:00.264
Can we talk over a cup of coffee?

35:00.348 --> 35:01.557
Sounds good.

35:03.643 --> 35:04.727
Elijah!

35:18.533 --> 35:21.577
You must be curious as to why
I'm not dragging Oh Jin-joo into this,

35:21.661 --> 35:24.622
but the panel is a three-person body.
Two is already a majority.

35:24.705 --> 35:26.958
So you're saying you don't need the rest?

35:27.041 --> 35:28.751
But Judge Oh is a good person.

35:30.503 --> 35:34.048
I don't believe in such fickle things
like goodwill or personal beliefs.

35:37.093 --> 35:41.013
You're only interested in
grudge, rage, and such.

35:41.097 --> 35:42.890
Yes, that's pretty much it.

35:44.684 --> 35:46.310
So from her sponsor to her son,

35:46.394 --> 35:49.647
is that why you've been
tenaciously targeting Cha Gyeong-hui

35:50.982 --> 35:52.066
from the very start?

35:53.234 --> 35:54.527
Because of Elijah?

36:02.368 --> 36:04.495
It's not as simple as you think.

36:06.080 --> 36:08.916
As I told you before,
there's no way around it

36:09.000 --> 36:11.377
if those who dominate the world
have formed one team.

36:12.587 --> 36:15.298
So you start by isolating
the most powerful.

36:15.798 --> 36:17.842
And she happens to be the easiest one too.

36:19.051 --> 36:20.303
Easiest?

36:20.386 --> 36:22.471
Do you know
why Cha Gyeong-hui is so powerful?

36:23.139 --> 36:24.891
Because she has everyone's weaknesses.

36:24.974 --> 36:28.144
I bet many will be happy to see
when she's cornered.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.188
As for me,

36:30.855 --> 36:33.316
I'm very much after everyone's weaknesses

36:33.399 --> 36:35.026
that Cha Gyeong-hui holds.

36:36.736 --> 36:38.863
So you'll press Cha Gyeong-hui even more

36:38.946 --> 36:42.575
until she offers you a deal
with her last card.

36:43.409 --> 36:46.245
If you've understood now,
start from reviewing this.

36:47.496 --> 36:49.498
Candidate cases
for the next <i>Live Court Show</i>.

36:50.166 --> 36:51.292
The show must go on

36:52.043 --> 36:54.170
since our only weapon
is the public's support.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.764
So, about Do Young-choon…

37:06.057 --> 37:07.558
Who is responsible for it?

37:07.642 --> 37:08.559
Well…

37:09.685 --> 37:11.479
I'm still looking into it myself.

37:11.562 --> 37:13.814
Whoever they are,
why do you think they did that?

37:15.024 --> 37:16.442
He's not a political prisoner,

37:16.525 --> 37:19.278
or a card to play
in international negotiations. So why?

37:20.196 --> 37:23.616
If there's no special reason,
usually it's to do with money.

37:24.951 --> 37:28.412
-Money?
-Money is a powerful motive

37:28.496 --> 37:29.622
to just about anyone.

37:39.131 --> 37:41.217
<i>Must you drag Judge Kim Ga-on into this?</i>

37:43.219 --> 37:45.638
-By going to such lengths…
<i>-Whether I like it or not,</i>

37:45.721 --> 37:48.349
I can't have an enemy
right behind my back.

37:51.352 --> 37:54.272
-Either I bring him onto my side…
<i>-Or?</i>

37:54.981 --> 37:57.817
Remove him if he's a risk.

38:06.242 --> 38:07.410
Elijah?

38:09.078 --> 38:10.913
Yes, come in.

38:16.794 --> 38:18.963
Back to ready-to-eat meals
when I'm gone, right?

38:21.507 --> 38:24.844
What were you talking about for so long?

38:24.927 --> 38:27.096
Tedious things. About work.

38:27.930 --> 38:30.349
-May I sit down?
-Sit.

38:31.851 --> 38:36.063
Then again, it can't be fun
with just you two old men.

38:36.147 --> 38:38.566
You're so mean. I'm not that old.

38:39.567 --> 38:40.526
Whatever.

38:41.610 --> 38:43.988
Why haven't you been
coming here these days?

38:45.114 --> 38:46.240
Well…

38:47.491 --> 38:49.618
I just had a lot of things on my mind.

38:52.538 --> 38:55.666
So I've been thinking

38:55.750 --> 38:58.002
about what you told me last time.

38:58.085 --> 39:00.671
-What was it again?
-That scammer.

39:00.755 --> 39:03.507
The one who's responsible
for your parents' death.

39:04.133 --> 39:06.552
Maybe I shouldn't have brought it up.
Don't mind it.

39:06.635 --> 39:08.512
But how can I not?

39:08.596 --> 39:11.015
Didn't you try to die several times
because of him?

39:12.767 --> 39:13.976
Elijah?

39:16.228 --> 39:18.230
-Let's kill him.
-What?

39:18.314 --> 39:20.816
I thought about it many times
and I think that's the best way.

39:20.900 --> 39:22.610
I mean, I just don't understand.

39:22.693 --> 39:26.155
Why should we provide a place to sleep,
clothe him, and feed him

39:26.238 --> 39:27.698
with our taxpayer's money?

39:27.782 --> 39:31.369
I mean, how can you sleep at night?
If I were you, I would be so angry.

39:31.452 --> 39:34.246
Which is why I've been thinking…

39:35.664 --> 39:37.833
I don't think it's all that impossible.

39:37.917 --> 39:40.211
I'll hack the prison system

39:40.294 --> 39:42.380
and find out when he's out of his cell.

39:42.463 --> 39:44.924
We'll use that chance to ambush him, and--

39:45.007 --> 39:47.551
-Elijah.
-Yes?

39:50.137 --> 39:53.599
Thanks for going so far for me.

39:53.682 --> 39:56.060
No, I just…

39:56.143 --> 39:58.813
But really, I'm fine now. Don't mind it.

40:01.107 --> 40:02.983
Oh, are you?

40:03.776 --> 40:05.236
All right, then.

40:08.823 --> 40:10.199
What if…

40:13.494 --> 40:16.497
This is just my absurd imagination.

40:18.124 --> 40:21.710
But what if someone switched
that bastard with someone else?

40:22.753 --> 40:24.004
Some random person, I mean.

40:25.798 --> 40:26.799
What?

40:27.550 --> 40:30.302
You've even been having such
nonsensical thoughts, have you?

40:31.345 --> 40:34.181
Instead of wasting your time like that,

40:34.265 --> 40:37.935
-let's just go kill--
-Right, it's nonsense.

40:38.811 --> 40:39.979
Of course.

40:40.688 --> 40:42.857
Who'd do such a crazy thing like that?

40:44.066 --> 40:45.109
I mean, why bother?

40:45.192 --> 40:46.485
Right?

40:48.446 --> 40:51.073
Unless it's for some absurd purpose
by an absurd person,

40:52.116 --> 40:53.492
why, right?

40:55.411 --> 40:57.705
Forget what I said.

40:57.788 --> 40:59.248
Have a good night, Elijah.

41:01.709 --> 41:02.710
Sweet dreams.

41:08.132 --> 41:09.383
Seriously?

41:24.690 --> 41:26.775
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY
YOON SU-HYEON

41:44.043 --> 41:45.586
What a surprise.

41:45.669 --> 41:48.631
I'd been thinking about you.

41:50.090 --> 41:54.261
Well, coming here
with old men are no help.

41:54.929 --> 41:55.888
That one.

42:02.728 --> 42:04.813
-What do you think?
-It's pretty. It suits you.

42:04.897 --> 42:06.857
Of course, I look good with anything.

42:11.612 --> 42:13.030
What about that one?

42:13.113 --> 42:14.949
I say that's too old…

42:16.075 --> 42:18.619
I mean, that's more for adults.

42:22.998 --> 42:23.999
You think so?

42:26.669 --> 42:31.465
By the way,
has something happened to Ga-on lately?

42:32.508 --> 42:33.592
Ga-on?

42:34.593 --> 42:35.636
Well…

42:37.096 --> 42:38.013
What?

42:38.097 --> 42:41.559
-I thought you're his best friend.
-Are you worried about him?

42:41.642 --> 42:44.186
Worried about him? Why would I be?

42:46.021 --> 42:47.314
I'll take this.

42:48.774 --> 42:51.068
And the one
that this old lady was looking at.

42:51.151 --> 42:52.152
Pardon?

42:52.861 --> 42:54.071
Old lady…

42:54.154 --> 42:57.616
Oh no, I'm fine.

42:57.700 --> 42:59.910
You should pick something.

43:00.744 --> 43:02.663
It's no fun
when I'm the only one shopping.

43:04.081 --> 43:05.332
That's nice, but…

43:07.876 --> 43:09.461
How about we go somewhere else?

43:10.212 --> 43:11.505
Somewhere else?

44:06.894 --> 44:08.145
You like him, don't you?

44:10.439 --> 44:11.482
What, the ice cream?

44:12.274 --> 44:13.192
I know you heard me.

44:14.735 --> 44:15.861
Oh, Ga-on?

44:16.820 --> 44:19.323
Well, I guess I can't deny it.

44:20.157 --> 44:23.452
I asked him out five times
ever since we were in kindergarten.

44:24.036 --> 44:27.081
-Five times?
-Though he rejected me every time.

44:29.500 --> 44:30.626
So why…

44:30.709 --> 44:32.628
Why did I keep asking him out?

44:33.462 --> 44:35.089
You're right. Why did I?

44:36.173 --> 44:39.760
I guess it was his face to begin with.
He was rather cute when he was little.

44:40.844 --> 44:42.054
And?

44:42.137 --> 44:43.222
Well…

44:43.889 --> 44:46.517
-Then he started crying.
-What?

44:48.560 --> 44:51.605
His family went bankrupt big time,

44:52.815 --> 44:54.483
so he had to quit kindergarten too.

44:57.111 --> 44:59.113
So he bawled his eyes out.

45:00.406 --> 45:02.616
But I just hated that.

45:03.951 --> 45:05.828
I just hated seeing him cry

45:07.079 --> 45:08.997
because I couldn't do anything for him.

45:10.624 --> 45:12.459
So before I realized it,

45:13.669 --> 45:14.962
I told him I liked him.

45:17.506 --> 45:18.966
I'm such an idiot, aren't I?

45:21.176 --> 45:23.512
So every time he cried…

45:26.849 --> 45:28.267
I saw Ga-on cry

45:29.685 --> 45:32.020
five times now.

45:46.535 --> 45:50.456
<i>I wonder what clouds of misfortune are
hovering over Ga-on's family</i>

45:52.249 --> 45:54.126
because they'd come one after another

45:55.586 --> 45:56.795
without stopping.

46:05.095 --> 46:06.388
It's getting too late.

46:07.306 --> 46:09.099
-Should we go?
-Su-hyeon!

46:15.397 --> 46:16.690
Wait for me.

46:20.068 --> 46:21.153
Sure, Elijah.

46:30.245 --> 46:31.205
Hey, it's me.

46:32.122 --> 46:34.082
You've covered Joongwon F&B before, right?

46:35.375 --> 46:38.253
Yes, can you look into
their financial history?

46:39.254 --> 46:40.380
All right, thanks.

46:43.759 --> 46:44.676
Ga-on!

46:45.719 --> 46:47.763
Sorry, I'm late.

46:47.846 --> 46:49.932
I know you're a busy man too,
Prosecutor Park.

46:50.015 --> 46:54.061
Come on, of course I should come running
when it's Judge Kim Ga-on,

46:54.144 --> 46:55.812
the bigshot of our class.

46:55.896 --> 46:58.440
-I'm a bigshot?
-Sure, you're a star.

47:00.526 --> 47:02.819
Hey, can I get your autograph?

47:02.903 --> 47:04.154
For my nephew.

47:05.030 --> 47:06.031
Sure.

47:07.449 --> 47:09.034
Well, I have a favor to ask.

47:10.035 --> 47:11.078
What is it?

47:11.161 --> 47:13.747
Well, there's an offender
who's still serving his term.

47:13.830 --> 47:15.207
He did about billions,

47:15.290 --> 47:18.043
and I'm sure the proceeds of crime squad
from then are still at your office.

47:18.126 --> 47:19.670
I know this is a difficult favor,

47:20.754 --> 47:22.714
but could you see
whether they managed to seize anything?

47:22.798 --> 47:26.927
-Is this for the <i>Live Court Show</i>?
-No, this is a personal request.

47:27.719 --> 47:28.887
Please, help me out here.

47:30.347 --> 47:31.807
Sure, all right.

47:32.891 --> 47:36.645
In return,
sign some more autographs for me.

47:37.312 --> 47:38.855
That alone won't do.

47:39.856 --> 47:41.400
Sure, thanks.

47:46.697 --> 47:48.031
Hey, you're home.

47:49.283 --> 47:52.244
-So now you're back for good, are you?
-Not quite.

47:52.995 --> 47:54.580
I need to look after these guys.

47:54.663 --> 47:56.665
You should come home
instead of dropping by.

47:56.748 --> 47:58.083
When will you come back?

47:58.166 --> 48:00.502
There are guys I need to
look after there too.

48:02.963 --> 48:05.799
Look after yourself too, please.

48:05.882 --> 48:06.883
What about me?

48:08.010 --> 48:10.429
What's there to look after?

48:16.310 --> 48:17.519
-Su-hyeon.
-Yes?

48:17.603 --> 48:20.355
-What's on your mind?
-Well, just…

48:22.107 --> 48:23.650
So, Ga-on…

48:23.734 --> 48:25.027
Professor!

48:30.991 --> 48:34.202
-Hello.
-Why are there so many stairs here?

48:34.953 --> 48:36.455
Gosh, my legs.

48:36.538 --> 48:38.749
So what brings you here at this hour?

48:45.464 --> 48:46.715
Did you enjoy it?

48:48.550 --> 48:49.926
Orange juice?

48:50.010 --> 48:52.763
You should have brought soju,
not orange juice!

48:52.846 --> 48:55.891
Of course.
You can't read the atmosphere, can you?

48:58.310 --> 49:01.647
I dropped by after talking to Su-hyeon.
She said you were dropping by.

49:01.730 --> 49:03.857
But you see me
at the Supreme Court every day.

49:03.940 --> 49:05.150
You really didn't have to.

49:06.068 --> 49:09.029
These days,
I don't know what the Supreme Court

49:09.946 --> 49:11.239
exists for anymore.

49:11.323 --> 49:14.826
Today I met with the Chief Justice,
and he was more like some army commander.

49:14.910 --> 49:17.496
He said all the courthouses
need to move in perfect order.

49:17.579 --> 49:21.458
I took the streets in my younger days,
but that wasn't for a country like this.

49:21.541 --> 49:24.127
Police have been given orders
to carry a gun at all times.

49:24.211 --> 49:27.339
I didn't become an officer to
point guns at our citizens.

49:28.965 --> 49:30.926
Police violence is getting worse too.

49:31.009 --> 49:33.387
Just a little noise from a drunkard,
they whip out--

49:33.470 --> 49:35.180
But is that so wrong?

49:36.431 --> 49:37.724
Ga-on.

49:38.934 --> 49:43.230
But it's not normal to have the officers
get beaten up by drunkards every night.

49:43.313 --> 49:44.898
That's not a normal country.

49:44.981 --> 49:48.235
A monster that's been freed from its rein

49:48.318 --> 49:50.570
will not choose to stop.

49:50.654 --> 49:53.115
And it's your department
who aroused that monster.

49:54.533 --> 49:55.784
So what will you do?

49:55.867 --> 49:57.744
I'm going to dismantle your department.

49:58.620 --> 50:00.539
There is no hope in the courthouse.

50:00.622 --> 50:04.334
If a grassroots organization raises
an issue and gets accepted by media

50:04.418 --> 50:07.254
the opposition will demand
an inspection of the administration.

50:07.337 --> 50:08.296
Ga-on.

50:10.507 --> 50:12.050
You hold the key to all this.

50:12.676 --> 50:16.596
I need all that
you've heard and seen to date.

50:17.347 --> 50:19.307
-Is this an order?
-I'm begging you.

50:20.267 --> 50:23.103
And I'm sorry.

50:28.400 --> 50:29.776
I'm to blame for all this.

50:33.905 --> 50:37.075
JUDGE KIM GA-ON

50:50.797 --> 50:53.383
-Yes, hello?
-Can I see you?

51:02.017 --> 51:03.226
So did you look over it?

51:04.978 --> 51:06.271
Look over what?

51:06.354 --> 51:09.274
What I gave you.
The cases for our next trial.

51:10.275 --> 51:11.526
Yes.

51:13.403 --> 51:14.863
You still need time to think, do you?

51:18.950 --> 51:20.535
Why don't you join me later?

51:22.996 --> 51:25.791
-Where are you going this time?
-I've something to show you.

51:37.803 --> 51:39.095
Where are we going?

51:42.182 --> 51:43.725
I asked where we are going.

51:46.978 --> 51:48.021
We're here.

51:49.231 --> 51:51.691
This is a friend of mine
who helps me out with my work,

51:51.775 --> 51:53.360
and this here is Judge Kim Ga-on.

51:54.194 --> 51:55.654
It's nice to meet you.

51:56.947 --> 51:59.699
I see you're the person who's been
doing the research on me.

51:59.783 --> 52:01.493
You're extremely skilled.

52:01.576 --> 52:05.413
I must say the same about you
and your research on Judge Kang Yo-han.

52:05.497 --> 52:08.333
I'm afraid I can't compliment your skills.

52:08.416 --> 52:09.918
They weren't so impressive.

52:10.502 --> 52:13.255
Then I'm sorry
because it's not my field of expertise.

52:14.381 --> 52:16.007
What a friendly atmosphere.

52:16.675 --> 52:18.718
Let's leave the introductions at that.

52:18.802 --> 52:21.388
Is this the person you wanted to show me?

52:23.390 --> 52:25.267
You asked me before

52:25.350 --> 52:28.186
about how to take on those
who control this world.

52:29.104 --> 52:31.356
If I were to explain it to you,
it's to set it up

52:31.439 --> 52:35.068
so that there's no way but to win
even before the game begins.

52:35.151 --> 52:36.528
How is that possible?

52:37.237 --> 52:39.114
Of course it's not easy to do so alone.

52:39.197 --> 52:40.907
That's why I have many others

52:40.991 --> 52:43.952
who help me out from here and there.

52:44.035 --> 52:46.037
You mean you have accomplices?

52:46.121 --> 52:47.455
They should be here soon.

52:51.668 --> 52:52.878
Mr. Go.

53:05.098 --> 53:06.808
<i>I'll meet with his attorney tonight.</i>

53:06.892 --> 53:08.059
President Joo.

53:08.143 --> 53:10.312
<i>So you admit to
professional negligence, do you?</i>

53:10.395 --> 53:11.813
Mr. Go.

53:11.897 --> 53:14.357
But you clearly said five years…

53:18.695 --> 53:20.739
So it wasn't just Jang Ki-hyeon
you'd bribed?

53:20.822 --> 53:23.825
Like I told you,
we need to set it up for a sure win

53:23.909 --> 53:25.577
before the game even begins.

53:26.411 --> 53:29.122
I'm sorry about everything
last time, Judge Kim.

53:30.832 --> 53:33.919
What about Mr. Lee's trial?
That was impossible to manipulate.

53:34.002 --> 53:36.087
You're right.
That would have been a tough one.

53:36.171 --> 53:38.590
But that doesn't mean
we can't start a spark.

53:39.257 --> 53:41.676
-Start a spark?
-It's always hard being the first one.

53:43.303 --> 53:45.931
Our aspiring actress.
She had a great tone.

53:46.014 --> 53:47.682
It's so nice to meet you.

53:47.766 --> 53:50.352
I'm a big fan of yours.
I even joined your fan club!

53:58.526 --> 54:01.821
<i>Hello, Judge Kang! I'm a big fan of yours.</i>

54:01.905 --> 54:03.698
<i>You're truly awesome.</i>

54:03.782 --> 54:05.575
<i>Anyway, that man is a total psycho.</i>

54:05.659 --> 54:07.619
<i>I used to work part-time for
valet service at a department store.</i>

54:07.702 --> 54:09.537
<i>Honestly, I was so frustrated and angry.</i>

54:19.089 --> 54:20.382
I wasn't bad, was I?

54:26.137 --> 54:27.597
Is it really okay to take this?

54:28.682 --> 54:29.891
Good work.

54:31.226 --> 54:32.477
Thank you.

54:51.705 --> 54:55.083
So what we've been doing
was all a show, was it?

54:55.166 --> 54:56.167
Show?

54:58.670 --> 55:00.880
I don't mind you criticizing me,

55:01.423 --> 55:04.300
but don't label our trial as fake.

55:05.176 --> 55:08.763
That's an insult to many out there
who took courage.

55:09.514 --> 55:12.017
We only helped them to step forward.

55:12.100 --> 55:14.936
Without their courage,
this would have been all impossible.

55:17.313 --> 55:18.898
I'm sorry I'm late.

55:18.982 --> 55:20.025
Welcome.

55:24.154 --> 55:27.198
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm Cho Min-sung, from the WAIS.

55:28.867 --> 55:31.369
I tried talking to Chief,
but his reaction was strange.

55:31.453 --> 55:32.787
He immediately got fractious.

55:32.871 --> 55:34.539
<i>Is he the one
who jumped up and down when you said</i>

55:34.622 --> 55:36.750
<i>-you wanted to track Kang Yo-han down?</i>
-Yes.

55:38.877 --> 55:40.962
You're Su-hyeon's boss.

55:41.046 --> 55:44.883
Yes. Su-hyeon may appear
to be fragile, but she's a talent.

55:44.966 --> 55:47.510
Her only fault is that
she's too enthusiastic at times.

55:47.594 --> 55:50.388
Has Judge Kang have been
rewarding you handsomely?

55:51.014 --> 55:51.931
Pardon?

55:52.849 --> 55:57.437
Money sure is a powerful motive
to just about anyone, I see.

55:57.520 --> 56:00.440
Judge Kim, I wouldn't get so smart.

56:00.523 --> 56:02.067
Did I say something wrong?

56:02.150 --> 56:05.653
Do you know why I'm helping Judge Kang?

56:07.238 --> 56:08.490
Why?

56:09.657 --> 56:11.826
In the humidifier sanitizer scandal…

56:13.328 --> 56:14.662
I lost my daughter.

56:16.039 --> 56:18.541
I'd spent my entire life
defending the conglomerates,

56:18.625 --> 56:21.669
so I didn't know what to do
when I was suddenly the victim.

56:23.546 --> 56:25.590
You know
how that case turned out, don't you?

56:25.673 --> 56:27.342
And the punishment that was served.

56:28.426 --> 56:29.469
Attorney Go.

56:30.178 --> 56:32.263
Don't call me an attorney.

56:32.347 --> 56:34.474
I've deceived my client,

56:34.557 --> 56:36.851
and a lawyer no more.

56:36.935 --> 56:38.103
I'm just a criminal.

56:39.062 --> 56:40.605
Once this is all over,

56:40.688 --> 56:43.358
I will gladly accept my punishment
for my sins.

56:46.736 --> 56:49.781
As for this young lady right here,
she was sexually assaulted

56:49.864 --> 56:51.449
while inebriated.

56:51.533 --> 56:55.036
But she simply had to watch her offender
released on probation.

56:57.038 --> 56:58.832
The judges said they'll excuse him,

56:59.499 --> 57:02.627
because he's a med student
with a bright future ahead of him.

57:03.378 --> 57:04.671
Then what about me?

57:05.964 --> 57:09.717
Are they telling me to just bear it
because my future isn't so bright?

57:17.350 --> 57:18.768
As for Detective Cho,

57:19.477 --> 57:23.022
his sister worked
at Serim Department Store.

57:23.106 --> 57:26.526
She'd been the breadwinner for our family,

57:26.609 --> 57:28.611
so she worked so hard
to feed her siblings.

57:29.320 --> 57:32.031
Even until that moment
when cracks appeared on the walls

57:32.115 --> 57:34.742
of the department store,
before they finally gave in.

57:36.077 --> 57:39.205
And what was the sentence
served to the offenders?

58:18.286 --> 58:19.579
Judge Oh.

58:26.503 --> 58:28.713
You're now the chairwoman, right?

58:29.714 --> 58:32.258
I hear you'll be chairing
our support committee too.

58:33.009 --> 58:36.054
Yes, I'm responsible for many things
despite my limited capability.

58:39.933 --> 58:43.561
I'm very much aware that
there were many issues

58:43.645 --> 58:45.271
with our foundation.

58:46.064 --> 58:46.981
Yes.

58:47.065 --> 58:48.733
So let me change that.

58:48.816 --> 58:51.402
I'll break all those collusive links with
politicians and privileged class,

58:51.486 --> 58:53.738
and return to serving the needy.

58:53.821 --> 58:55.156
Back to where we started.

58:56.658 --> 58:59.077
Yes, I'm sure it won't be easy,

58:59.744 --> 59:02.539
but please let me know
if there's anything I can help with.

59:02.622 --> 59:04.249
I'd very much like to help.

59:07.794 --> 59:09.087
So beautiful.

59:10.338 --> 59:13.925
What the public needs right now
is a smile like yours.

59:14.008 --> 59:16.511
When the times are dark, we need hope.

59:16.594 --> 59:19.180
Smiles, tears, and friendliness.

59:20.848 --> 59:24.352
While Judge Kang has
that mysterious charm,

59:26.020 --> 59:28.273
it's as if he lives
in another world, right?

59:31.693 --> 59:32.819
You're right.

59:33.736 --> 59:37.865
Which is why I think
you should step forward a bit more.

59:37.949 --> 59:39.492
Step forward?

59:39.576 --> 59:43.621
Are you content
with just being Judge Kang's background?

59:47.959 --> 59:51.254
Many are concerned about
Judge Kang's actions.

59:51.337 --> 59:52.797
Tampering with the witnesses,

59:52.880 --> 59:55.633
and abusing the media to ask
whether the public supports him.

59:56.509 --> 1:00:00.179
Some have started to ask,
maybe the <i>Live Court Show</i> should be

1:00:00.263 --> 1:00:02.640
entrusted to someone
who's more becoming of a judge.

1:00:18.781 --> 1:00:19.991
Judge Oh?

1:00:22.994 --> 1:00:26.581
Why don't you and I continue to discuss
the operations of the <i>Live Court Show</i>?

1:00:26.664 --> 1:00:30.043
Someone has to keep their
eyes wide open, won't they?

1:00:41.095 --> 1:00:42.847
Something feels missing.

1:00:49.520 --> 1:00:51.731
Oh no, you really can't…

1:00:51.814 --> 1:00:53.316
No, no. This is just a costume.

1:00:57.487 --> 1:00:58.655
A costume.

1:01:01.157 --> 1:01:04.577
You need to stay friendly,
but dominate the entire time

1:01:04.661 --> 1:01:07.622
you're on stage.

1:01:09.332 --> 1:01:11.334
Because charisma is power.

1:01:36.484 --> 1:01:39.070
SU-HYEON

1:01:43.574 --> 1:01:44.867
Hey, Su-hyeon.

1:01:52.083 --> 1:01:54.419
<i>Ga-on. You hold the key to all this.</i>

1:01:54.502 --> 1:01:57.422
<i>I need all that
you've heard and seen to date.</i>

1:02:03.177 --> 1:02:04.178
Hello?

1:02:04.262 --> 1:02:06.514
<i>Ga-on, are you ready to
give me those autographs?</i>

1:02:13.771 --> 1:02:19.277
REPORT ON THE CRIME PROCEEDS
SEIZURE FOR DO YOUNG-CHOON

1:02:23.865 --> 1:02:26.534
REPORT ON THE CRIME PROCEEDS
SEIZURE FOR DO YOUNG-CHOON

1:02:51.601 --> 1:02:54.187
-What is this?
-You knew, didn't you?

1:02:54.270 --> 1:02:56.773
The sudden transfer of Do Young-choon,

1:02:56.856 --> 1:02:59.692
the maintenance of their computer server,

1:02:59.776 --> 1:03:02.111
and the disbanding
of the crime proceeds squad.

1:03:02.195 --> 1:03:04.155
They all fall in the same period.

1:03:04.238 --> 1:03:06.657
The period when, Joongwon F&B,
run by her husband,

1:03:06.741 --> 1:03:08.576
was on the brink of bankruptcy,

1:03:09.368 --> 1:03:11.996
and when Cha Gyeong-hui became
the Minister of Justice.

1:03:12.079 --> 1:03:14.081
That was exactly
when the fraud who took billions

1:03:14.165 --> 1:03:18.085
and who'd managed to stash it away
disappeared into thin air.

1:03:18.169 --> 1:03:20.963
I bet you found out before I did,
so why didn't you tell me?

1:03:21.047 --> 1:03:23.925
Because you'd have doubted me
if you hadn't found out yourself.

1:03:24.008 --> 1:03:26.886
-That I was involved in it.
-Why did you even go there?

1:03:26.969 --> 1:03:29.764
For what reason did you visit him
and find out he was switched

1:03:29.847 --> 1:03:31.432
with someone else?

1:03:31.516 --> 1:03:32.975
You already know why.

1:03:33.059 --> 1:03:36.270
You'd actually meant to
show Do Young-choon

1:03:36.354 --> 1:03:39.857
living comfortably like a king in there
to provoke me, didn't you?

1:03:39.941 --> 1:03:41.734
Isn't that why you'd gone there
to check him out?

1:03:41.818 --> 1:03:44.612
To stir me up
because I always get in your way!

1:03:44.695 --> 1:03:45.822
I wanted you…

1:03:47.782 --> 1:03:49.492
to be on my side.

1:03:50.618 --> 1:03:53.579
If I needed to, I would have gladly
gone to farther lengths,

1:03:53.663 --> 1:03:55.748
be it switching him with someone else.

1:03:56.415 --> 1:03:57.792
That's my way of doing things.

1:03:58.751 --> 1:04:02.588
And that will never change.

1:04:29.615 --> 1:04:31.659
-Ga-on.
-Professor.

1:04:32.493 --> 1:04:35.413
It's rare for you to
call me out like this.

1:04:35.496 --> 1:04:36.622
You punk.

1:04:41.294 --> 1:04:43.045
So you've made up your mind, have you?

1:04:46.924 --> 1:04:48.551
You've added more gray hair.

1:04:50.511 --> 1:04:51.929
Gray hair's no big deal.

1:04:52.013 --> 1:04:54.307
In fact, I'm proud to
still have hair at this age.

1:04:57.768 --> 1:04:59.312
<i>Who's going to build a safe Korea?</i>

1:04:59.395 --> 1:05:02.106
<i>Aren't you going to build a safe Korea?</i>

1:05:02.189 --> 1:05:03.774
<i>It's left to us to build it.</i>

1:05:03.858 --> 1:05:07.236
<i>What, are we just going to
leave it to the police? No, no, no!</i>

1:05:07.320 --> 1:05:08.362
<i>That's not on.</i>

1:05:08.446 --> 1:05:10.823
-I've been watching this all day.
-He's so funny.

1:05:10.907 --> 1:05:13.117
<i>We should clean up
as the owners of this country!</i>

1:05:13.200 --> 1:05:15.786
-Pour me one.
<i>-We should!</i>

1:05:15.870 --> 1:05:17.622
<i>I mean, go out there on the streets.</i>

1:05:17.705 --> 1:05:19.999
<i>It's full of homeless, vagabonds,</i>

1:05:20.082 --> 1:05:23.002
<i>the discontent, and especially foreigners!</i>

1:05:23.085 --> 1:05:26.297
<i>It's the foreigners who are
behind all the atrocious crimes.</i>

1:05:26.380 --> 1:05:27.548
<i>So what should we do?</i>

1:05:27.632 --> 1:05:30.635
<i>We need to clean the streets. Who?</i>

1:05:39.185 --> 1:05:40.227
"We worked hard."

1:05:40.311 --> 1:05:43.564
"Pay us what we're owed.
We worked so hard!"

1:05:43.648 --> 1:05:45.942
Is that all the Korean they can speak?

1:05:46.025 --> 1:05:48.736
Flog those trashy bastards
who are leeching off our country.

1:05:48.819 --> 1:05:50.071
Flog them!

1:05:50.154 --> 1:05:52.031
Our proud citizens!

1:05:52.114 --> 1:05:55.201
Tonight is the night
we become the real owners!

1:05:55.284 --> 1:05:57.328
The real owners of this country. How?

1:05:57.411 --> 1:05:58.496
Like this!

1:05:58.579 --> 1:06:01.040
<i>This madness must be stopped.</i>

1:06:02.208 --> 1:06:04.961
<i>Because rage is contagious.</i>

1:06:05.711 --> 1:06:07.463
But who created it in the first place?

1:06:09.715 --> 1:06:11.300
What?

1:06:11.384 --> 1:06:13.552
This madness and public rage…

1:06:15.763 --> 1:06:17.932
Who was it that created it
in the first place?

1:06:25.856 --> 1:06:27.233
-Su-hyeon.
-Yes?

1:06:27.316 --> 1:06:28.317
Look.

1:06:29.026 --> 1:06:31.028
Look. What do you think?

1:06:31.112 --> 1:06:32.863
I don't know, to be honest.

1:06:32.947 --> 1:06:35.658
What? I think it's nice.

1:06:44.375 --> 1:06:46.127
Elijah, I'm really sorry.

1:06:46.210 --> 1:06:48.879
-Stay here for a bit, all right?
-What?

1:06:50.798 --> 1:06:52.800
Don't ever come out, all right?

1:06:52.883 --> 1:06:54.093
But Su-hyeon!

1:06:54.176 --> 1:06:57.430
Hey, so you worked so hard?

1:06:58.347 --> 1:06:59.724
"Pay us what we're owed?"

1:07:12.445 --> 1:07:13.571
Hands above your heads!

1:07:14.447 --> 1:07:15.614
Put your cameras down.

1:07:17.575 --> 1:07:19.535
<i>You think our people are fools</i>

1:07:19.618 --> 1:07:21.787
that they're raging because
they were instigated by propaganda?

1:07:22.913 --> 1:07:27.084
The start was something else altogether.
It was the bad guys.

1:07:27.877 --> 1:07:31.297
Those bastards who deserve to die
for making the innocent cry blood.

1:07:31.380 --> 1:07:33.924
Was it such a hard request

1:07:34.008 --> 1:07:36.927
asking for them to be rightfully punished?

1:07:38.054 --> 1:07:39.055
Ga-on…

1:07:39.138 --> 1:07:40.598
You should've done a good job.

1:07:41.265 --> 1:07:43.434
If people like you had done a good job

1:07:43.517 --> 1:07:45.895
and as a justice too,

1:07:45.978 --> 1:07:47.605
this wouldn't have happened.

1:07:48.481 --> 1:07:51.484
People with such responsibilities
should have done a better job.

1:08:00.117 --> 1:08:01.118
So…

1:08:04.747 --> 1:08:06.832
you've made your choice, have you?

1:08:06.916 --> 1:08:08.417
It was you

1:08:10.044 --> 1:08:11.754
who forced me to make a choice.

1:08:13.172 --> 1:08:16.175
If there is no justice in this world
but only a game,

1:08:18.010 --> 1:08:21.013
I'd now like to play
the winning game, myself.

1:09:41.218 --> 1:09:42.178
Are you an officer?

1:09:43.888 --> 1:09:45.139
Do you want to shoot me?

1:09:47.057 --> 1:09:48.309
Go on.

1:09:50.853 --> 1:09:52.897
I know you can't.

1:09:52.980 --> 1:09:54.231
Put that down, now.

1:09:55.441 --> 1:09:56.609
Capture it on camera.

1:10:04.700 --> 1:10:06.952
If you're going to shoot, shoot!

1:10:07.036 --> 1:10:09.622
How could an officer point her gun

1:10:09.705 --> 1:10:13.542
at an innocent citizen who's unarmed?
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

1:10:25.429 --> 1:10:26.597
Are you regretting it?

1:10:32.728 --> 1:10:34.146
Let me promise you one thing.

1:10:36.232 --> 1:10:37.566
Your parents' enemy,

1:10:38.651 --> 1:10:40.736
and those bastards who sneaked them out…

1:10:43.030 --> 1:10:44.657
They will pay

1:10:45.699 --> 1:10:46.992
and very dearly too.

1:10:49.370 --> 1:10:51.455
This isn't just for revenge.

1:10:51.538 --> 1:10:52.581
Then what?

1:10:55.042 --> 1:10:58.170
I want to fight against
this distorted world.

1:11:12.268 --> 1:11:16.397
THANK YOU TO PARK HYOUNG-SOO
FOR HIS SPECIAL APPEARANCE

1:11:43.716 --> 1:11:46.885
<i>Instead of those folks like
Heo Joong-se and Cha Gyeong-hui,</i>

1:11:46.969 --> 1:11:49.346
you should be in charge of this country.

1:11:49.430 --> 1:11:50.806
<i>Be the sheepdog, is it?</i>

1:11:50.889 --> 1:11:53.559
<i>-Let's get started.</i>
-They are using us.

1:11:53.642 --> 1:11:54.685
<i>It's time to get them.</i>

1:11:54.768 --> 1:11:58.022
<i>Your enemy,
and those that sneaked him out.</i>

1:11:58.105 --> 1:12:00.983
<i>I ought to breed
a more faithful and loyal organization,</i>
