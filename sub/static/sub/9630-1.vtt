01:22.800 --> 01:24.670
What are you doing?

01:24.720 --> 01:26.470
Is your Spotify working?

01:26.520 --> 01:27.710
Yeah. Why?

01:27.760 --> 01:29.630
I dunno, mine's being retarded.

01:29.680 --> 01:31.550
Alex Freeman probably hacked you.

01:31.600 --> 01:35.600
He did mine and changed every
single playlist to Jason Derulo.

01:35.880 --> 01:37.430
I still haven't forgiven Alex

01:37.480 --> 01:40.070
for changing all my contacts
to Harry Potter characters.

01:40.120 --> 01:42.630
~ What a twat!
~ He put himself as Voldemort.

01:42.680 --> 01:44.790
Oh, please! More like
Neville Longbottom.

01:44.840 --> 01:47.230
My mum was Bellatrix Lestrange.

01:47.280 --> 01:48.870
At least he got that right.

01:48.920 --> 01:50.990
Here, what do we think
of this bronzer?

01:51.040 --> 01:53.230
You look like a Wotsit.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.510
See, this is why I need you.

01:55.560 --> 01:57.350
My mum is now on
Snapchat, by the way.

01:57.400 --> 01:58.430
Urgh! Why?!

01:58.480 --> 02:01.310
I'd like to say she's just
trying to reconnect,

02:01.360 --> 02:03.750
but I actually think she likes it.

02:03.800 --> 02:05.230
What are you doing?

02:05.280 --> 02:07.430
Checking flights to Barca.

02:07.480 --> 02:11.230
Casey! We're going to Outlook!
Why are you fighting this?

02:11.280 --> 02:13.230
Sonar! Barcelona has culture.

02:13.280 --> 02:14.750
Er, Pula has a beach!

02:14.800 --> 02:16.430
Barcelona has a beach,

02:16.480 --> 02:19.670
and plus, if we don't get any more
money, we're not going anywhere.

02:19.720 --> 02:20.910
Casey?

02:20.960 --> 02:22.070
What?

02:22.120 --> 02:23.270
Nathan.

02:23.320 --> 02:24.670
Please don't use the N-word.

02:24.720 --> 02:25.950
You should look.

02:26.000 --> 02:26.990
At what?

02:27.040 --> 02:28.430
His tweet.

02:28.480 --> 02:30.310
I unfollowed him. What does it say?

02:30.360 --> 02:31.670
It's not very nice.

02:31.720 --> 02:33.310
Can you just read it?

02:33.360 --> 02:37.360
"I guess it's no surprise that Casey
Jacobs is on antidepressants.

02:37.880 --> 02:41.880
"I spent one night with
her and it depressed me."

02:48.760 --> 02:52.760
How could he write that?

02:53.280 --> 02:55.630
Are you OK?

02:55.680 --> 02:57.470
How does he know? I
haven't told anyone.

02:57.520 --> 02:58.870
Tamara?

02:58.920 --> 03:00.390
You're the only one I've told.

03:00.440 --> 03:04.440
He was in your room,
did he see your pills?

03:04.760 --> 03:06.950
Casey, I didn't tell anyone.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
Yeah, I know.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.310
Oh, my God, no!

03:14.360 --> 03:15.990
We are doing this!

03:16.040 --> 03:17.830
~ What?
~ You know who!

03:17.880 --> 03:19.630
Oh, no, Megan, just leave it.

03:19.680 --> 03:22.070
What? No way! He owes us.

03:22.120 --> 03:25.110
~ Hey, Alex.
~ Hey. What do you guys want?

03:25.160 --> 03:27.390
Thanks for hacking my friend's
Spotify account.

03:27.440 --> 03:30.390
You think I have nothing better to
do than hack your Spotify accounts?

03:30.440 --> 03:32.110
We KNOW you have nothing
better to do.

03:32.160 --> 03:33.790
Put the porn away. We need your help.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.950
I'm not looking at porn!

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
Have you seen what that dickwad
Nathan Legg has just tweeted?

03:42.000 --> 03:43.550
Oh, peak!

03:43.600 --> 03:44.910
Don't say "peak", Alex

03:44.960 --> 03:48.350
I didn't even know you and
Nathan broke up. Sorry, Casey.

03:48.400 --> 03:49.950
Yeah, don't be, he's a fucktard.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.630
So, what do you want me to do?

03:51.680 --> 03:53.550
~ Hack that motherfucker.
~ Megan...

03:53.600 --> 03:56.350
~ What? Come on, let's do him!
~ Just wait.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.830
Er, I'm not hacking Nathan Legg.

03:57.880 --> 04:01.150
~ Why not?
~ Guess what? He's not going
to kick the shit out of you.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.710
~ How would he know it was you?
~ Yeah, how WOULD he know, genius?

04:03.760 --> 04:06.030
As soon as anyone in school
gets hacked, they blame me!

04:06.080 --> 04:07.390
You should have thought of that

04:07.440 --> 04:09.230
before you hacked
everyone, Voldemort!

04:09.280 --> 04:11.830
All right, fuck you, Megan!
I've hacked, like, two people.

04:11.880 --> 04:15.880
All right, get back to
your porno, then, Useless!

04:16.360 --> 04:18.149
Oh, shit. Jack's here.

04:18.200 --> 04:19.630
Wait, you're going out?

04:19.680 --> 04:21.870
Text me, OK?

04:21.920 --> 04:24.670
OK, but won't Jack mind?

04:24.720 --> 04:26.350
I love you, bitch.

04:26.400 --> 04:30.400
I love you, ho.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
Case?

05:10.520 --> 05:12.350
Case?

05:12.400 --> 05:13.710
Yeah?

05:13.760 --> 05:14.990
What's wrong?

05:15.040 --> 05:16.990
Nothing!

05:17.040 --> 05:20.550
What do you want for dinner?

05:20.600 --> 05:22.190
(For fuck's sake...)

05:22.240 --> 05:26.240
I'm not hungry!

05:26.760 --> 05:28.110
When will you be hungry?!

05:28.160 --> 05:32.160
I DON'T KNOW, OK? CAN YOU
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE?!

05:35.920 --> 05:39.920
Jesus!

06:41.560 --> 06:45.560
We both call each other
bitch, you idiot!

07:10.600 --> 07:14.600
(Nathan's profile?)

07:28.120 --> 07:32.120
Erectile dysfunction makes me bitter.

07:35.680 --> 07:37.910
So bitter,

07:37.960 --> 07:41.960
I vent my limp-dicked anger on women.

07:46.520 --> 07:50.520
Please pray for me
and my pathetic penis.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.350
Nathan.

07:56.400 --> 08:00.400
Kiss.

09:35.520 --> 09:37.750
Shit!

09:37.800 --> 09:41.800
Who the fuck...?

09:55.880 --> 09:59.880
No, we don't!

10:01.520 --> 10:04.870
'Hi, it's Megan. Leave me a message
and I MIGHT get back to you.'

10:04.920 --> 10:07.430
Hey, bitch. Sorry, I
know you're with Jack.

10:07.480 --> 10:08.790
Er, can you give me a call?

10:08.840 --> 10:11.470
I think someone's online as Alex.

10:11.520 --> 10:14.710
Yeah, just call me back.

10:14.760 --> 10:18.760
Fuck off!

10:33.080 --> 10:37.080
Of course.

10:41.320 --> 10:45.320
Whatever!

11:08.440 --> 11:12.440
A fan of what, you freak?

11:38.720 --> 11:42.110
How the fuck...?

11:42.160 --> 11:44.550
I can't stop shopping.
I don't know what it is,

11:44.600 --> 11:46.750
I see it and I literally
am in love with it.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.870
Sometimes I feel like there
are just the odd item

11:48.920 --> 11:50.830
that you can't live without.

11:50.880 --> 11:54.880
I'm a big blazer, kind
of kimono fan...

11:54.960 --> 11:57.990
And you can open and close
them by turning the top.

11:58.040 --> 12:01.550
And you can open and close
them by turning the top.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.990
'This is the perfect neon
I've been looking for.

12:04.040 --> 12:06.030
'I never know what to pick!

12:06.080 --> 12:08.430
'This is the perfect neon
I've been looking for.

12:08.480 --> 12:09.750
'I never know what to pick!'

12:09.800 --> 12:12.550
This is muchos, muchos affordable.
Muchos, muchos affordable

12:12.600 --> 12:16.390
Barg, barg...

13:05.440 --> 13:09.440
Hypocrite.

13:22.200 --> 13:26.200
Without anyone judging us.

13:38.400 --> 13:42.400
No fucking way!

13:45.960 --> 13:49.630
'Hi, it's Megan. Leave me a message
and I MIGHT get back to you.'

13:49.680 --> 13:52.350
Hey, bitch. I'm sorry
I missed your call.

13:52.400 --> 13:55.310
You need to check your Instagram,
some fucker's into Alex's stuff

13:55.360 --> 13:59.360
and mine and now yours. Just call me.

15:30.840 --> 15:32.980
(Fuck, fuck, fuck...)

16:58.480 --> 17:02.480
Casey?

17:03.720 --> 17:05.990
Case?

17:06.040 --> 17:07.869
Yeah?

17:07.920 --> 17:11.790
I'm taking Simon to football.

17:11.839 --> 17:15.839
You all right?

17:19.280 --> 17:23.280
I'm fine!

17:33.480 --> 17:37.480
Are we alone now, Casey?

17:40.320 --> 17:42.630
I know. It's awful...

17:42.680 --> 17:46.550
I sound like a constipated
Stephen Hawking.

17:46.600 --> 17:47.710
What the fuck?

17:47.760 --> 17:51.760
And yes, I can totally hear you too.

17:53.280 --> 17:57.280
Now, sit down, Casey.

18:06.040 --> 18:09.830
What did you do with that photo?

18:09.880 --> 18:12.350
Nothing yet.

18:12.400 --> 18:16.310
Why did you take them, Casey?

18:16.360 --> 18:18.710
Nathan practically begged me to!

18:18.760 --> 18:22.760
And it was just that one.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.430
Now, now, Casey.

18:26.480 --> 18:30.480
Pants on fire, I counted
five, at least.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.870
Nathan, if this is you...

18:36.920 --> 18:40.190
I'll tell everyone what you told
me your mum did on holiday

18:40.240 --> 18:42.470
in Weston-super-Mare!

18:42.520 --> 18:46.520
I could've put that in
the tweet, but I didn't!

18:51.240 --> 18:55.240
What did Nathan's mother do on
holiday in Weston-super-Mare?

18:58.400 --> 19:02.400
Please, Casey. Do you really
think Nathan Legg could do this?

19:06.280 --> 19:09.910
~ What are you doing?
~ Flexing my muscles.

19:09.960 --> 19:13.310
No wait, show me again, show me
again, do it again, do it again.

19:13.360 --> 19:17.030
No, no, its more like...

19:17.080 --> 19:20.670
~ Stop checking me out.
~ She needs to just hurry up and come out.

19:20.720 --> 19:22.670
Seriously, it's getting embarrassing.

19:22.720 --> 19:23.990
It's like a dog on heat.

19:24.040 --> 19:27.950
~ She'll wait till she's at
Uni, then she'll go full dyke.
~ God!

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
Yeah, then we'll be like, "Tamara,
no shit you're gay?" Who knew?

19:32.240 --> 19:34.990
All those times you came over,
just as we happened to be getting

19:35.040 --> 19:39.040
changed, and stared at us half
naked, for like, ever...

19:39.160 --> 19:41.150
We had no idea!

19:41.200 --> 19:44.390
~ Next time she stares at me
I'm going to say something.
~ Well, like what?

19:44.440 --> 19:48.440
Like, Tamara, you're a total
fucking lesbian, deal with it.

19:53.200 --> 19:56.470
What are you doing?

19:56.520 --> 19:59.230
This is Tamara, right?

19:59.280 --> 20:02.750
~ Wait.
~ You said she needs to come out.

20:02.800 --> 20:05.350
Wait, what are you doing?

20:05.400 --> 20:09.400
No, no, no! Please, don't. Stop!

20:11.600 --> 20:14.630
No wait, show me again, show me
again, do it again, do it again.

20:14.680 --> 20:17.830
No, no, no, it's more like...

20:17.880 --> 20:20.510
~ What have you done?
~ Stop checking me out.

20:20.560 --> 20:22.190
That was nothing.

20:22.240 --> 20:24.190
Seriously, It's getting embarrassing.

20:24.240 --> 20:28.240
Now imagine if I did that
with your special selfies?

20:31.560 --> 20:35.560
You know what happens to girls
when those photos get out there?

20:42.400 --> 20:45.990
If you try to shut down...

20:46.040 --> 20:50.030
If you try to switch
off the router...

20:50.080 --> 20:54.080
If you leave the room,
the pictures go online.

20:59.840 --> 21:03.840
What do you want?

21:05.240 --> 21:08.150
Patience, Casey.

21:08.200 --> 21:12.200
First of all, I want you to sit.

21:21.880 --> 21:25.880
Look! Twitter-storm alert.

21:26.800 --> 21:30.800
Oh, God!

21:34.440 --> 21:36.950
Don't be too sad, Casey.

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
You upset ME first!

21:42.840 --> 21:45.790
You lied to me, Casey.

21:45.840 --> 21:48.150
About the door.

21:48.200 --> 21:50.830
It wasn't closed, was it?

21:50.880 --> 21:53.830
You promised.

21:53.880 --> 21:57.880
And you weren't going to eat a
chicken dinner either, were you?

22:03.840 --> 22:07.840
No more lies, Casey.

22:08.960 --> 22:12.960
Only truth.

22:13.760 --> 22:17.760
Say, you promise.

22:20.080 --> 22:21.750
Fine.

22:21.800 --> 22:25.430
Say, you promise.

22:25.480 --> 22:29.480
I promise.

22:34.320 --> 22:36.070
Tell me what you're thinking, Casey.

22:36.120 --> 22:39.310
Hi, its Megan, leave me a message
and I might get back to you.

22:39.360 --> 22:42.110
Tell me what you're thinking, Casey.

22:42.160 --> 22:44.310
I'm thinking about what
my friends will do

22:44.360 --> 22:48.360
when they find out that
my webcam has been hacked

22:48.640 --> 22:52.640
and that it wasn't me that posted
that video about Tamara.

22:52.840 --> 22:55.510
I'm thinking about how
they'll track you down,

22:55.560 --> 22:59.560
find you and fuck you up!

23:05.160 --> 23:08.150
Knock, knock.

23:08.200 --> 23:11.670
~ Knock, knock.
~ Who's there?

23:11.720 --> 23:15.720
You'll never, ever know.

23:18.520 --> 23:22.520
I know you're over 30.

23:23.800 --> 23:26.230
It's the way you speak.

23:26.280 --> 23:28.510
With the BFFs and the lols?

23:28.560 --> 23:32.560
You sound like a parent.

23:33.600 --> 23:37.600
Get that right, did I?

23:37.760 --> 23:40.750
How old are you?

23:40.800 --> 23:44.800
Just tell me one thing
about yourself.

23:45.320 --> 23:49.070
What colour is your hair?

23:49.120 --> 23:51.870
Or are you bald?

23:51.920 --> 23:55.920
That's it, isn't it? I am sorry.
I've heard it can be a really

23:56.160 --> 24:00.160
traumatic time for a middle
aged man losing all his hair.

24:00.400 --> 24:03.910
What makes you think I'm a man?

24:03.960 --> 24:07.030
It's not fair!

24:07.080 --> 24:11.080
You know everything about me
and I know nothing about you.

24:12.120 --> 24:16.120
Pick it up.

24:16.640 --> 24:20.640
Go ahead. Get the phone.

24:31.640 --> 24:35.110
Hey, Casey, does this sound familiar?

24:35.160 --> 24:38.070
Hi, its Megan, leave me a message
and I might get back to you.

24:38.120 --> 24:40.550
I'm thinking about what
my friends will do

24:40.600 --> 24:44.110
when they find out my
webcam has been hacked.

24:44.160 --> 24:46.230
I'm thinking about how
they'll track you down,

24:46.280 --> 24:48.670
find you and fuck you up!

24:48.720 --> 24:52.720
Casey, if I can take
over your computer,

24:53.640 --> 24:56.950
do you really think I'd let you have

24:57.000 --> 24:58.630
a smartphone to play with?

24:58.680 --> 25:01.870
Why are you doing this?!

25:01.920 --> 25:05.920
I told you, I help victims
of cyber bullying.

25:08.280 --> 25:11.350
Really?

25:11.400 --> 25:12.630
Oh, yes.

25:12.680 --> 25:16.680
How the hell is this helping me?

25:23.760 --> 25:27.760
Ouch, that hurts! Soooo funny.

25:28.400 --> 25:32.400
What's so fucking funny?

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
You're not the victim, Casey.

25:41.920 --> 25:44.920
You're the Cyber Bully!

26:01.400 --> 26:04.910
How am I a cyberbully?

26:04.960 --> 26:07.270
Wow, let me see.

26:07.320 --> 26:11.270
So many examples.

26:11.320 --> 26:13.070
'I can't stop shopping.'

26:13.120 --> 26:16.230
'Sometimes I feel like there are
items that you can't live without.'

26:16.280 --> 26:18.070
What? You think THAT
is cyber bullying?

26:18.120 --> 26:21.030
'I don't know what it is, I see it
and I literally am in love with it.'

26:21.080 --> 26:23.670
You're ridiculing people
on the internet.

26:23.720 --> 26:27.070
What would you call it?

26:27.120 --> 26:31.120
These are the sort of girls that
bully ugly and fat kids at school!

26:31.240 --> 26:35.230
And that makes it OK
to bully them online?

26:35.280 --> 26:36.750
It's not bullying!

26:36.800 --> 26:37.950
It's...

26:38.000 --> 26:39.270
It's sarcastic!

26:39.320 --> 26:41.870
What about Mr Soft?

26:41.920 --> 26:43.630
What Nathan? What about him?

26:43.680 --> 26:45.990
Erectile dysfunction?

26:46.040 --> 26:50.040
Can you imagine how much shit
he's going to get for that?

26:59.080 --> 27:03.080
It wasn't him, was it?

27:03.480 --> 27:05.550
You that sent that tweet.

27:05.600 --> 27:09.600
You didn't even stop to question it.

27:16.240 --> 27:19.510
What do you want from me?

27:19.560 --> 27:23.350
Three things...

27:23.400 --> 27:27.400
First, I want you to admit
what you really are.

27:28.080 --> 27:30.110
What.. a bully?

27:30.160 --> 27:34.160
Then I want you to realise
who you have hurt.

27:35.600 --> 27:36.990
Nathan?

27:37.040 --> 27:41.040
And some idiot shoppers?

27:44.720 --> 27:46.630
What, her?

27:50.520 --> 27:53.150
You took her down.

27:53.200 --> 27:54.910
Jennifer Li? No, I didn't.

27:56.880 --> 27:58.910
Oh, God, she is just beyond awful.

28:01.200 --> 28:04.990
~ â™ª Keep burning, keep... â™ª
~ How did you know her?

28:05.040 --> 28:08.910
I told you, she was in the
year above me at school.

28:08.960 --> 28:12.870
You really found her funny, huh?

28:14.600 --> 28:18.600
Chronic Youth, that's
you, right, Casey?

28:18.840 --> 28:22.790
"When singers are too
deluded for X Factor."

28:22.840 --> 28:25.270
Steerpike underscore 84...

28:25.320 --> 28:28.270
"Har har - too shit for X Factor."

28:28.320 --> 28:30.790
Alise underscore Dr1...

28:30.840 --> 28:32.790
"Wat a talentless whore."

28:32.840 --> 28:34.630
Mike2Rite...

28:34.680 --> 28:37.230
"Go drink a bleach cocktail."

28:37.280 --> 28:38.950
Urpaltommy...

28:39.000 --> 28:42.830
"I fucked her and she
gave me chlamydia."

28:42.880 --> 28:44.150
Mike2Rite...

28:44.200 --> 28:47.710
"Just the kind of plastic bitch
who should be destroyed."

28:47.760 --> 28:50.030
I didn't write all this!

28:50.080 --> 28:53.230
But you started it, Casey.

28:53.280 --> 28:57.030
You threw in the grenade and ran.

28:57.080 --> 28:59.670
I just shared what
was already out there.

28:59.720 --> 29:01.950
That's not all you did.

29:02.000 --> 29:06.000
Is it... Moe?

29:07.360 --> 29:10.230
Oh, Come on! Moe Lester?

29:10.280 --> 29:13.710
~ How did she not see..?
~ Read it.

29:13.760 --> 29:15.390
Aloud.

29:15.440 --> 29:17.710
"Jen. My name is Moe Lester.

29:17.760 --> 29:20.150
"I am CEO of Columbia Records.

29:20.200 --> 29:22.990
"Would you be interested
in signing with us?

29:23.040 --> 29:24.990
"Columbia!"

29:25.040 --> 29:27.670
"Hi, Moe. Yes, thanks
for your message.

29:27.720 --> 29:30.230
"I would be super stoked
to sing along with you guys,

29:30.280 --> 29:31.750
"it would be awesome."

29:31.800 --> 29:33.070
Hi Moe.

29:33.120 --> 29:37.120
Yes, I would be super stoked
to sing with you guys.

29:37.280 --> 29:39.110
"Super Stoked," who says that?

29:39.160 --> 29:43.160
'We are putting together
a new girl band.'

29:46.120 --> 29:50.120
Like you never pretended
to be someone you're not.

29:51.240 --> 29:55.230
I do it to help victims
of cyber bullying.

29:55.280 --> 29:57.710
Everyone does it!

29:57.760 --> 30:01.710
Nathan and Stuart Gorton pretended
to be a Russian lap dancer,

30:01.760 --> 30:04.470
flirting with Kyle Harris for weeks!

30:04.520 --> 30:07.430
Kyle was going to meet her in a hotel.
He thought they were in love.

30:07.480 --> 30:09.430
The whole school knew about it!

30:09.480 --> 30:13.110
And you think that's OK?

30:13.160 --> 30:15.870
See, this is how I know you're old,

30:15.920 --> 30:17.590
you don't get it!

30:17.640 --> 30:21.030
Of course I don't think it's
OK, it's fucking nasty.

30:21.080 --> 30:25.070
But it's normal, it happens
and we deal with it.

30:25.120 --> 30:27.750
Like Jennifer did?

30:27.800 --> 30:29.830
Why, what did she do?

30:29.880 --> 30:31.470
You don't know?

30:31.520 --> 30:34.150
No, she moved away

30:34.200 --> 30:35.870
Hi, guys.

30:35.920 --> 30:38.950
This is just a video to say,
I'm sorry the new website

30:39.000 --> 30:41.070
isn't up and running yet.

30:41.120 --> 30:43.870
I know most of you have been following
me for the right reasons,

30:43.920 --> 30:47.270
and I thank you for
your love and support.

30:47.320 --> 30:51.320
Unfortunately, there are some haters
who follow me wherever I go,

30:51.720 --> 30:55.510
who have forced me to change domain
names and make a new website.

30:55.560 --> 30:59.150
I would just like to say that
if you are one of the people

30:59.200 --> 31:01.750
sending pictures of
dead animals to me

31:01.800 --> 31:05.310
there's something wrong with
you and you need help.

31:05.360 --> 31:09.150
For those of you who are looking
forward to my next recording,

31:09.200 --> 31:13.200
I can reveal that I'm working
on some new songs of my own,

31:13.440 --> 31:17.440
and they will be about Autumn because
that's my favourite season.

31:18.480 --> 31:21.230
Oh, apart from Spring.

31:21.280 --> 31:25.280
It's important the haters realise
that expressing creativity

31:25.600 --> 31:28.710
is a fundamental human right...

31:28.760 --> 31:30.790
Why is she doing this to herself?

31:30.840 --> 31:33.710
.. and you shoot me down,
but I won't fall. No hate.

31:33.760 --> 31:35.030
Peace out.

31:35.080 --> 31:39.080
Rule number one, don't
feed the trolls!

31:39.160 --> 31:43.160
And let me guess, they
trolled this video too?

31:45.920 --> 31:49.920
Hello?

31:58.280 --> 32:02.280
Oh, shit!

32:02.760 --> 32:06.760
(Jennifer...)

32:12.480 --> 32:15.630
Jennifer?

32:15.680 --> 32:19.390
I'm sorry.

32:19.440 --> 32:21.670
I'm so sorry I hurt you.

32:21.720 --> 32:25.190
I should have just kept
my stupid mouth shut.

32:25.240 --> 32:29.240
I had no right to judge you.

32:29.680 --> 32:33.680
The truth is...

32:33.760 --> 32:37.760
.. I've always been kind
of jealous of you.

32:38.040 --> 32:42.040
At school you looked so...

32:43.000 --> 32:45.030
.. comfortable...

32:45.080 --> 32:47.750
with yourself.

32:47.800 --> 32:51.800
And then online you
put yourself out there

32:52.600 --> 32:54.990
for everyone to see.

32:55.040 --> 32:58.510
And that's so cool.

32:58.560 --> 33:02.560
I could never do something like that.

33:04.240 --> 33:08.240
I use fake names.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.430
Which makes me a bit of a coward,

33:11.480 --> 33:15.480
I guess...

33:16.160 --> 33:18.150
Touching, Casey.

33:18.200 --> 33:20.870
Almost truthful, even.

33:20.920 --> 33:24.920
But I'm not Jennifer.

33:29.080 --> 33:32.270
What is that?

33:32.320 --> 33:36.320
Girls at Jennifer's new school
dressed up as her for Halloween.

33:42.520 --> 33:46.520
The pictures were sent
to her family members.

33:50.480 --> 33:53.710
These arseholes that did this...

33:53.760 --> 33:56.670
That's fucked up!

33:56.720 --> 33:59.550
But why are you picking on me?

33:59.600 --> 34:03.600
Because you were the first
to troll Jennifer's video.

34:04.880 --> 34:06.990
It started with you.

34:07.040 --> 34:09.230
It would have happened anyway.

34:09.280 --> 34:10.909
Someone else would have done it.

34:10.960 --> 34:12.310
You can't know that.

34:12.360 --> 34:14.190
Yes, I can!

34:14.239 --> 34:16.670
Because if there's
one thing we all know

34:16.719 --> 34:19.830
it's that everything
gets slated online.

34:19.880 --> 34:23.880
Jennifer Li knew that when
she posted her videos.

34:24.480 --> 34:25.989
Didn't you, Jennifer?

34:26.040 --> 34:28.590
I'm not Jennifer.

34:28.639 --> 34:30.989
Yes, you are.

34:31.040 --> 34:32.870
You're Jennifer Li.

34:32.920 --> 34:36.350
Blaming me for all this just
because I was the first person

34:36.400 --> 34:39.429
who posted that video is
just the kind of corny,

34:39.480 --> 34:41.909
sentimental bullshit Jennifer
Li would come up with.

34:41.960 --> 34:45.960
It fits perfectly with that,
"look at me" victim identity.

34:49.000 --> 34:53.000
You know why you get
bullied, Jennifer?

34:53.679 --> 34:57.680
It's because you ask for it.

35:01.160 --> 35:03.190
Wow!

35:03.240 --> 35:04.910
Well done, Casey.

35:04.960 --> 35:08.070
Now you're talking
like your true self.

35:08.120 --> 35:09.310
A bully.

35:09.360 --> 35:13.360
Well, then, I guess we're all
bullies, aren't we, Jennifer?

35:13.760 --> 35:17.750
I am not Jennifer Li.

35:22.160 --> 35:26.160
What is that?

35:26.520 --> 35:28.270
She didn't.

35:28.320 --> 35:30.630
Jennifer thought that
if she posted this

35:30.680 --> 35:34.510
the troll's would leave her alone.

35:34.560 --> 35:37.390
She was wrong.

35:37.440 --> 35:40.470
Steerpike underscore 84...

35:40.520 --> 35:42.230
"Lame effort."

35:42.280 --> 35:44.710

35:44.760 --> 35:46.710
"Attention whoring bitch."

35:46.760 --> 35:48.110
I can read it for myself.

35:48.160 --> 35:50.990
Blaze underscore 7
underscore Blaze...

35:51.040 --> 35:54.150
"Try the other side of the
arm, you'll bleed more."

35:54.200 --> 35:55.710
You don't need to read it out loud.

35:55.760 --> 35:57.630
Would you like to see her last video?

35:57.680 --> 35:59.350
No.

36:13.680 --> 36:17.270
Oh, I've seen these.

36:17.320 --> 36:19.950
They tell their sad story...

36:35.200 --> 36:37.710
Why do they take so long over it?

36:48.000 --> 36:50.590
My parents are divorced,

36:50.640 --> 36:53.590
I didn't subject the world
to my singing voice.

37:19.040 --> 37:23.040
I didn't know that.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.230
I didn't know any of this.

38:27.800 --> 38:29.350
I get it.

38:29.400 --> 38:31.070
It's fucking terrible.

38:41.400 --> 38:44.630
~ I don't need to watch any more.
~ Yes, you do, Casey.

38:44.680 --> 38:47.110
This fucking music...

38:52.400 --> 38:54.190
Look at the screen, Casey.

39:10.840 --> 39:14.350
The abuse went on and on.

39:14.400 --> 39:18.400
It only stopped two weeks ago.

39:20.880 --> 39:24.880
What happened two weeks ago?

39:35.440 --> 39:37.830
Shut the fuck up.

39:37.880 --> 39:41.880
Go on.

40:06.880 --> 40:10.310
I would've heard about it.

40:10.360 --> 40:14.190
Jennifer did not make
the front pages.

40:14.240 --> 40:17.550
Cybersuicides aren't
what they used to be.

40:17.600 --> 40:18.870
You...

40:18.920 --> 40:21.430
You're lying.

40:21.480 --> 40:25.480
I'm surprised you didn't
troll her memorial page.

40:27.440 --> 40:28.990
'Sup, Casey?

40:29.040 --> 40:30.910
Regrets?

40:30.960 --> 40:32.510
B-Bu...

40:32.560 --> 40:34.710
But she-she was unstable -

40:34.760 --> 40:38.760
with her mum and who knows what
else was going on at home?

40:40.680 --> 40:44.190
You were Jennifer Li's first troll.

40:44.240 --> 40:46.270
You have to face up to that.

40:46.320 --> 40:48.350
You can't seriously blame m...

40:48.400 --> 40:52.400
I wonder what your friends will say
when they realise you started this.

40:54.640 --> 40:58.350
Nobody knows Chronic
Youth is you, right?

40:58.400 --> 41:02.070
Not even Megan.

41:02.120 --> 41:06.120
Will she still be your BFF?

41:15.040 --> 41:19.040
I think I know who you are.

41:26.840 --> 41:28.590
I can't...

41:28.640 --> 41:32.640
I can't even imagine what it must
be like to lose someone you love...

41:34.680 --> 41:38.680
.. especially like this.

41:39.400 --> 41:43.230
I've never lost anyone.

41:43.280 --> 41:46.150
My mum...

41:46.200 --> 41:48.540
She doesn't live with us.

41:50.320 --> 41:53.510
Of course, you know that.

41:53.560 --> 41:57.560
You know everything.

41:58.280 --> 42:02.280
She's not well.

42:07.920 --> 42:11.190
I know what it's like...

42:11.240 --> 42:13.750
.. to have a mum...

42:13.800 --> 42:17.270
who's different...

42:17.320 --> 42:21.320
.. and isn't there for you.

42:22.960 --> 42:26.230
I know what it's like to
go to school every day

42:26.280 --> 42:30.280
and pretend there's not
a problem when there is.

42:33.200 --> 42:37.200
And... anxiety? Well...

42:46.360 --> 42:49.830
I...

42:49.880 --> 42:52.230
I am so sorry.

42:52.280 --> 42:56.280
SO sorry for what happened
to your daughter.

42:58.720 --> 43:01.110
And it makes me feel sick

43:01.160 --> 43:05.160
to think that I was one of
those people who hurt her.

43:11.240 --> 43:14.030
Wrong. I am not Jennifer's father

43:14.080 --> 43:16.470
Well, stepmum, or stepsister?

43:16.520 --> 43:18.990
I know that I'd want
to get back at someone

43:19.040 --> 43:21.110
if they ever tried to
hurt my little brother.

43:21.160 --> 43:24.430
I am not Jennifer's sister, brother,

43:24.480 --> 43:27.510
lover, or anyone who knew her.

43:27.560 --> 43:30.510
WELL, WHO ARE YOU, THEN?!

43:30.560 --> 43:34.560
Why are you doing this, you
pathetic fucking loser?!

43:37.600 --> 43:41.600
< I'm back, Case.

43:41.990 --> 43:42.990
< Case?

43:43.040 --> 43:44.840
Careful, Casey.

43:47.760 --> 43:51.590
No daddy, Casey.

43:51.640 --> 43:55.640
You in there?

44:03.680 --> 44:05.710
I'm getting changed.

44:05.760 --> 44:07.230
You going to bed?

44:07.280 --> 44:09.070
What? No.

44:09.120 --> 44:11.790
So what you getting changed for?

44:11.840 --> 44:12.910
Fuck you.

44:12.960 --> 44:14.430
What?!

44:14.480 --> 44:16.950
Nothing! I just...

44:17.000 --> 44:19.030
Can I help you?!

44:19.080 --> 44:21.750
I'm making you something
to eat, come downstairs.

44:21.800 --> 44:23.750
I'll eat later.

44:23.800 --> 44:26.150
Well...

44:26.200 --> 44:28.350
.. just come down anyway.

44:28.400 --> 44:30.600
Barcelona are playing.

44:32.920 --> 44:35.230
What's wrong, Casey?

44:39.080 --> 44:42.230
Can I come in?

44:42.280 --> 44:46.280
No!

44:47.200 --> 44:49.150
I'm fine. Please!

44:49.200 --> 44:51.470
Did you have an argument
with Megan or something?

44:51.520 --> 44:54.920
~ Why would you even say that?
~ I don't know!

44:56.680 --> 45:00.680
How can I know what's going
on if you don't speak to me?

45:02.360 --> 45:05.790
Dad! Just go!

45:05.840 --> 45:07.870
Casey...

45:07.920 --> 45:11.590
No! Dad, please!

45:11.640 --> 45:14.750
What don't you understand
about privacy?!

45:14.800 --> 45:18.550
Can't I just have a minute
to get changed?!

45:18.600 --> 45:22.600
What is wrong with you?!

45:57.800 --> 46:01.800
What is it you want from me?

46:02.800 --> 46:06.800
You want me to admit I'm a bully?

46:07.040 --> 46:10.390
I'm a bully.

46:10.440 --> 46:12.910
You're recording this?

46:12.960 --> 46:14.630
Of course you are.

46:14.680 --> 46:18.680
Make sure you get this.

46:20.840 --> 46:22.430
I...

46:22.480 --> 46:26.480
take responsibility...
for Jennifer Li's suicide.

46:27.960 --> 46:30.470
It was me.

46:30.520 --> 46:31.710
You mean it?

46:31.760 --> 46:32.790
I mean it.

46:32.840 --> 46:34.830
Truth, Casey.

46:34.880 --> 46:36.750
Promise.

46:36.800 --> 46:39.150
Weird.

46:39.200 --> 46:41.350
What's weird?

46:41.400 --> 46:43.150
After all the build-up...

46:43.200 --> 46:47.200
it feels kind of underwhelming.

46:47.760 --> 46:51.760
I think it's because it's insincere.

46:53.720 --> 46:56.510
I believe you'll wait
until I've gone away,

46:56.560 --> 47:00.560
then tell everyone that's some crazy
hacker forced you to confess.

47:03.800 --> 47:07.750
Well, what do you want me to say?

47:07.800 --> 47:09.830
Nothing.

47:09.880 --> 47:13.070
We need action, not words.

47:13.120 --> 47:16.070
What action?

47:16.120 --> 47:20.120
It's time to take your medicine.

47:21.360 --> 47:25.360
I've already had my medication
for today, thank you.

47:27.040 --> 47:30.040
There's going to be a second helping.

47:49.520 --> 47:53.520
'Ask yourself a question, Casey.

47:54.800 --> 47:58.800
'What will life be like
after I've posted this?'

48:02.640 --> 48:05.710
But you said you wouldn't!

48:05.760 --> 48:08.030
'Will it be worth living?'

48:08.080 --> 48:10.790
I've done everything that you asked!

48:10.840 --> 48:13.910
'I asked for three things.

48:13.960 --> 48:17.590
'You've accepted you're a bully.

48:17.640 --> 48:21.630
'You admitted you killed Jennifer Li.

48:21.680 --> 48:24.510
'Now you have to make amends.

48:24.560 --> 48:28.560
'The pills or the pictures.

48:29.320 --> 48:33.320
'Either way, your life is over.'

48:35.960 --> 48:38.830
Fuck you.

48:38.880 --> 48:41.550
'One pill, Casey.'

48:41.600 --> 48:44.510
What?

48:44.560 --> 48:48.560
'All you need to do to stop me from
tweeting this picture is swallow

48:49.520 --> 48:53.520
'one of your little white pills.'

48:57.520 --> 48:58.830
One?

48:58.880 --> 49:02.880
'One pill, one picture.'

49:34.960 --> 49:38.960
'I know what you're thinking, Casey.

49:39.600 --> 49:43.600
'Did you shoot six topless
selfies, or only five?

49:47.320 --> 49:50.710
'To tell you the truth,
in all this excitement,

49:50.760 --> 49:54.760
'I've kind of lost track myself.

49:55.040 --> 49:58.910
'In any case, five or six
pills won't kill you.

49:58.960 --> 50:02.430
'We both know that.

50:02.480 --> 50:04.150
'For this to work,

50:04.200 --> 50:08.200
'we're going to need
some more photographs.'

50:12.080 --> 50:13.350
Leave Megan out of this.

50:13.400 --> 50:15.550
'Take one pill, or it gets tweeted...

50:15.600 --> 50:19.600
'from your account.'

50:22.040 --> 50:26.040
'Time's up.'

50:26.800 --> 50:30.800
No!

50:42.000 --> 50:43.030
'Next.

50:43.080 --> 50:47.080
'Your BFF again.'

50:50.320 --> 50:53.270
'One more pill won't hurt you, Casey.

50:53.320 --> 50:57.320
'But it might spare Megan some hate.

51:01.400 --> 51:03.870
'Time's up.'

51:05.840 --> 51:09.840
'Wow. Bad friend.'

51:13.840 --> 51:17.840
'How about this one?

51:18.600 --> 51:22.600
'It's different when it's you, huh?'

51:36.360 --> 51:40.360
'So, you're happy to pop pills to
save yourself from a slut-shaming.

51:41.800 --> 51:45.800
'But you don't mind ruining
your BFF's life.

51:46.240 --> 51:50.240
'Next.

51:50.880 --> 51:54.880
'One pill.

52:07.680 --> 52:11.680
'Wow. Loyalty!'

52:11.960 --> 52:15.790
Ha-ha. You're funny(!)

52:15.840 --> 52:19.840
'Har. Har. You too.'

52:36.880 --> 52:40.880
Go on. Laugh some more.

52:46.040 --> 52:50.040
I'll give you this one for free,
if you laugh at me again.

52:51.760 --> 52:55.760
'O-M-F-A-O.'

52:56.800 --> 53:00.800
No. Laugh at me properly,
you know, har har.

53:03.160 --> 53:07.160
'Har. Har. Har.'

53:08.920 --> 53:12.920
Slainte.

53:16.800 --> 53:20.800
I wasn't the first, was I?

53:22.320 --> 53:24.470
I wasn't the first person
to comment on Jennifer Li.

53:24.520 --> 53:26.710
'Of course you were, Casey.'

53:26.760 --> 53:29.790
Show me.

53:29.840 --> 53:33.840
Show me, and I'll take five pills.

53:41.120 --> 53:42.910
'Chronic Youth.

53:42.960 --> 53:46.960
'You were the first.'

53:47.920 --> 53:50.830
Yes.

53:53.000 --> 53:57.000
But you were the second.

53:59.640 --> 54:03.350
Steerpike underscore 84.

54:03.400 --> 54:07.190
I can tell it's you
from the way you type.

54:07.240 --> 54:10.670
H-A-R. No-one spells it like that.

54:10.720 --> 54:12.670
'Five pills, Casey.'

54:12.720 --> 54:15.950
You must write like that because it
sounds better in the Hawking voice.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.950
You must have got used
to typing like that.

54:18.000 --> 54:19.670
'You're embarrassing yourself.'

54:19.720 --> 54:22.110
Does that mean I can track
you down now, Steerpike?

54:22.160 --> 54:24.910
'Take the pills, or it all goes up.'

54:24.960 --> 54:26.590
84?

54:26.640 --> 54:28.750
What's that, the year you were born?

54:28.800 --> 54:32.800
~ 'Take the pills.'
~ I'll do you a deal.

54:36.040 --> 54:38.670
You leave me alone,

54:38.720 --> 54:41.310
right now,

54:41.360 --> 54:45.360
and I'll forget about Steerpike 84.

54:47.280 --> 54:51.280
'OMFG! This is the funniest
video I have ever made!'

54:52.840 --> 54:54.750
Really?

54:54.800 --> 54:57.430
How many of these have you made?

54:57.480 --> 55:00.830
How many kids have you bullied
to death? What about Jennifer?

55:00.880 --> 55:03.750
You trolled her more than anyone.
You take responsibility,

55:03.800 --> 55:07.800
you sick twisted fuck!

55:08.920 --> 55:12.920
You want me to overdose?

55:13.200 --> 55:16.270
Here's my suicide note.

55:16.320 --> 55:18.110
They'll find it next to me.

55:18.160 --> 55:22.160
And then they'll come and find you.

55:22.520 --> 55:24.750
'Maybe.

55:24.800 --> 55:28.710
'But you'll be dead.

55:28.760 --> 55:31.350
'I still win.

55:31.400 --> 55:35.400
'Now swallow the fucking pills, or
your pics will be online for ever.'

55:38.440 --> 55:42.440
Megan's on the phone.

55:43.840 --> 55:47.840
Case?

55:56.200 --> 55:59.510
I'm not talking to her.

55:59.560 --> 56:02.590
Look, it's none of my business, Case,

56:02.640 --> 56:06.640
but it sounded like
she'd been crying.

56:10.160 --> 56:14.160
I don't care. Tell
her to stop calling.

56:22.720 --> 56:26.720
'Great job, Casey. Outstanding.

56:28.680 --> 56:31.310
'There's only one way
to end the pain now.'

56:31.360 --> 56:32.750
Case?

56:32.800 --> 56:35.910
'He is really starting to annoy me.'

56:35.960 --> 56:39.960
I told her you didn't want to talk,
and she said to give you a message.

56:43.040 --> 56:44.670
She told me to tell you,

56:44.720 --> 56:48.720
"Whatever is going on,
she knows this isn't you."

56:52.560 --> 56:55.110
All right?

56:55.160 --> 56:59.160
Here endeth the message.

56:59.760 --> 57:03.760
'He interrupts again, Casey, I'm
going to have to take action.

57:11.120 --> 57:14.630
'Casey?'

57:14.680 --> 57:18.670
'No, Casey!

57:18.720 --> 57:20.870
'You stupid, ugly bitch.

57:20.920 --> 57:24.920
'Now you have to start over.

57:32.600 --> 57:36.600
'Where are you going, Casey?

57:39.000 --> 57:40.400
'Casey?'

57:55.760 --> 57:58.230
'Stay where I can see you.'

58:00.000 --> 58:03.310
Need to get rid of this
before it sets in.

58:03.360 --> 58:07.310
There's nothing worse than
a puke smell, don't you think?

58:07.360 --> 58:09.830
'Three seconds, and it all goes up.'

58:09.880 --> 58:13.880
One time, Megan puked all
over her mum's living room.

58:15.280 --> 58:19.280
We were scrubbing that carpet
for hours, and it still stank.

58:21.800 --> 58:23.950
Raspberry vodka puke.

58:24.000 --> 58:25.950
'Three...'

58:26.000 --> 58:30.000
I told her mum it was me, so
she wouldn't get grounded.

58:31.640 --> 58:35.640
'Two...'

58:36.440 --> 58:40.440
She'd do the same for me.

58:40.640 --> 58:44.640
'I'm poting your shit, Casey.'

58:46.120 --> 58:47.390
Poting?

58:47.440 --> 58:48.470
'Posting, bitch.'

58:48.520 --> 58:51.470
You having finger trouble?

58:51.520 --> 58:54.310
Slow down.

58:54.360 --> 58:58.360
Relax.

59:02.600 --> 59:06.600
Go for it.

59:06.680 --> 59:10.110
Post what you like.

59:10.160 --> 59:12.350
'Your life is over.'

59:12.400 --> 59:16.400
Is it?

59:16.720 --> 59:19.750
What are you going to do?

59:19.800 --> 59:22.910
Are you going to come here?

59:22.960 --> 59:25.750
And hack my family?

59:25.800 --> 59:29.800
Hack my best friend?

59:32.280 --> 59:36.270
Which reminds me...

59:36.320 --> 59:40.320
.. I need to call her back.

59:40.680 --> 59:41.870
'Stay with me.

59:41.920 --> 59:45.920
'I'll tell you who I really am.'

59:52.440 --> 59:54.430
Promise?

59:54.480 --> 59:58.480
'Promise.'

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:07.640
I thought you said I'd never know.

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:13.800
I thought you had some super
geek firewall IP rerouter,

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:21.280
and I'd never find out
who you really are.

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:27.150
But you know what?

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:31.200
It doesn't matter.

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:40.240
What are you when I
stop talking to you?

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:46.550
Nothing.

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:50.600
'Case...'

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:10.280
Dad!

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:21.960
Dad!
