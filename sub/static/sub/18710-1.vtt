And everybody knows their place here.

07:09.856 --> 07:15.287
Heroics? - Right, but look at
your grades, you're failing.

07:15.322 --> 07:18.515
You haven't done one
heroic deed all semester.

07:18.555 --> 07:22.636
I'm thinking of changing your
major to something else.

07:23.335 --> 07:25.550
Start with the "V"...

07:25.551 --> 07:31.142

It's honorable and worthy
fairytale profession, Jack.

07:42.495 --> 07:45.695
Please sir, all I ever
wanted to be is a hero.

07:45.855 --> 07:48.075
You want to be a hero?

07:48.175 --> 07:53.175
Everybody wants it Jack,
but few that commit.

07:53.195 --> 07:55.599
I will.

07:55.699 --> 08:00.075
Your making me laugh, Jack.
Stop, your killing me.

08:00.095 --> 08:03.514
I don't think you're up to it.

08:03.614 --> 08:09.994

Jack's father.

08:23.734 --> 08:26.173
I am not like my father.

08:26.273 --> 08:27.332
He failed.

08:27.333 --> 08:31.248
No, he disappeared.
Lost on the heroes quest.

08:31.334 --> 08:34.974
No, Jack. He failed, ran away.

08:37.874 --> 08:42.832
Well, I wont. I work harder.
I'll prove to you, to everybody...

08:43.013 --> 08:46.574
that I'm not a failure.

08:46.614 --> 08:49.134
Really Jack?

08:49.144 --> 08:51.594
Have a good weekend.

08:52.594 --> 08:59.543
Homework is navigation and Hansel and
Gretel try to be better this time.

08:59.653 --> 09:01.974
Don't worry, I have plan.

09:24.683 --> 09:31.482
Sir, if I do a heroic
deed, would you pass me?

09:32.992 --> 09:39.693
I'll need... what?

10:22.621 --> 10:25.421
Heroic Report Card.
Overall Grade: F.

10:26.131 --> 10:28.932
Good morning butcher, baker. Frank.
- Hello.

10:29.142 --> 10:30.962
Sorry, Mayor Lichfield.

10:31.772 --> 10:34.621
You must try to stay focus on
where you going young man.

10:34.622 --> 10:36.171
Exactly my problem.

10:36.281 --> 10:39.001
Good afternoon, Lib-re.

10:39.111 --> 10:41.211
Oh, good afternoon mayor.

10:41.321 --> 10:43.141
I love the new clothes.

10:43.351 --> 10:46.852
Oh, thank you. How kind,
yes it fits like a globe.

10:47.062 --> 10:49.161
oh jelly-good, jelly-good.

10:49.271 --> 10:50.671
OK then.

10:50.881 --> 10:52.701
Mayor Lichfield.
- Yes...

10:52.911 --> 10:55.011
How do you make a sacrifice?

10:55.021 --> 10:58.521
Oh, I love a good riddle. I do know Jack.
Do you read sacrifice?

10:58.531 --> 11:00.350
Its a question.

11:00.360 --> 11:03.861
Oh, you actually asking cause
you wonder my advice, do you?

11:03.871 --> 11:07.671
its a good question Jack and
its a very simple answer.

11:08.081 --> 11:12.581
The way to make a sacrifice
is to take the most precious

11:12.582 --> 11:17.080
thing that you have and give it
away to help someone else.

11:17.290 --> 11:20.311
Really? - Really.
That's all...

11:20.321 --> 11:22.421
That's all to it, young man.

11:22.531 --> 11:24.856
Thank you very much.
- Oh, you're very welcome.

11:24.857 --> 11:27.080
You're very good boy.
Do watch where you going and

11:27.081 --> 11:29.456
excuse me I have to go
but the pipe pipe giving

11:29.457 --> 11:31.830
the recital and I don't
wanna be late, bye-bye.

11:33.940 --> 11:36.041
...we're be late... come, come...

11:37.951 --> 11:40.750
Right, what's the most
precious thing I have.

11:45.660 --> 11:47.580
The old the video game.

11:57.490 --> 12:00.590
That's weird, I don't
remember that being there.

12:30.999 --> 12:33.119
Hello, anyone here?

12:38.529 --> 12:41.089
Hey, hi.. How you doing?
Good to see you.

12:41.090 --> 12:44.049
Bonjour no welcoming, what's up?

12:45.549 --> 12:46.749
Hey.

12:47.459 --> 12:51.659
What can I do for you, how can I help?
What do you want, what do you need?

12:51.769 --> 12:53.869
This is everything I own.

12:56.178 --> 12:58.278
And I'm willing to give it up.

13:00.189 --> 13:04.149
Oh, the old digital bulk-eye, the computer

13:04.150 --> 13:09.008
of wonders the cyber jersey, C.O.W

13:10.508 --> 13:11.708
...the COW.

13:14.318 --> 13:17.339
I'll give you 500 gold pieces for it.

13:18.049 --> 13:19.169
What?

13:20.179 --> 13:21.298
600?

13:21.608 --> 13:23.708
No, its only worth like 50.

13:24.118 --> 13:25.518
Alright, 700?

13:25.528 --> 13:28.128
No, offer me like 10.
- 800?

13:28.238 --> 13:30.238
5.
- 900?

13:30.248 --> 13:32.148
You're going the wrong way.

13:32.258 --> 13:34.378
Final offer, a 1000.

13:34.578 --> 13:37.987
You're not helping.
I mean 2000% profit is not a sacrifice.

13:37.988 --> 13:39.788
And I want to make a sacrifice.

13:40.498 --> 13:43.898
No money, lets just trade.

13:44.099 --> 13:47.224
Wow, I like it.

13:47.459 --> 13:51.121
What about some a iron cane powder?

13:53.122 --> 13:56.333
No, very poisonous or

14:00.533 --> 14:04.245
Do you know?
At midnight last night some girls let

14:04.346 --> 14:06.557

14:06.558 --> 14:10.208
one of a kind, its a collectors
item. It's worth a fortune.

14:10.318 --> 14:11.517
No.

14:14.527 --> 14:19.727
I have a spinning wheel that spin
straw into gold, you'll be rich.

14:19.737 --> 14:20.857
No.

14:21.567 --> 14:25.867
- Hand of Minos, its a little gross.
- No, you don't get it.

14:32.377 --> 14:33.427
Three beans.

14:36.528 --> 14:37.576
Three beans?

14:38.386 --> 14:40.706
Is it a trade or what?

14:40.716 --> 14:44.217
You're gonna give me three
lousy beans for my C.O.W?

14:44.227 --> 14:47.427
- Take it or leave it?
- I'll take it.

14:49.237 --> 14:52.336
What generosity, what sacrifice.

14:52.546 --> 14:56.096
Thank you.
- You're welcome, no problem.

14:56.097 --> 14:59.147
See you another, good to change.

15:04.156 --> 15:05.976
See you around, Jack.

15:12.586 --> 15:15.385
Hey there, Grayson. Whose the good boy?

15:19.396 --> 15:20.516

15:21.926 --> 15:26.826
Hey mom, guess who did a totally
heroic today? - Hey Jack.

15:28.935 --> 15:33.936
Mom, what's wrong?
- Oh nothing. How was your day?

15:35.246 --> 15:38.546
Good.
- Thats good. Good, I'm glad.

15:39.356 --> 15:46.355
- How's yours?
- Well... I got fired.

15:46.665 --> 15:48.985
What? What happened?

15:50.296 --> 15:54.295
Apparently, elves is coming at
night and finishing all our work.

15:55.105 --> 15:58.605
Now the shoe maker wants to cut back
on labor force so he can save money.

15:58.815 --> 16:00.915
Hmpfh, stupid goody goody elf.

16:05.325 --> 16:06.724
That's OK mom.

16:07.134 --> 16:11.235
Things will be better after dinner.
I'm starving, how about you?

16:15.545 --> 16:17.365
We're not starving.

16:22.874 --> 16:24.275
Bread crumbs?

16:24.285 --> 16:27.085
Yeah, a couple of kids
just throw them away.

16:32.094 --> 16:35.094
Bread crumbs? Brilliant plan.

16:35.095 --> 16:38.094
You couldn't ask for
direction, could you?

16:39.104 --> 16:40.224
Man.

16:41.034 --> 16:42.435
Sit down Jack.

16:45.644 --> 16:50.344
Jack, we have to do something
very hard right now.

16:50.554 --> 16:55.054
We're in a tight spot and I need
you to do to make a big sacrifice.

16:55.264 --> 16:56.964
Funny, you just said that.

16:56.974 --> 17:02.674
I want you to sell the C.O.W, Jack.
It is the only thing we have a value.

17:02.684 --> 17:04.834
But, mom.
- With the money we get from that,

17:04.835 --> 17:08.284
we could feed ourself until
I get back on my feet.

17:08.294 --> 17:11.193
Well, here's the thing.
I cant really do that.

17:11.502 --> 17:14.303
I need you to be brave about this.

17:14.313 --> 17:16.414
I would, I really would but mom...

17:16.424 --> 17:18.243
There's no but, Jack.

17:19.154 --> 17:20.973
I don't have it anymore.

17:21.884 --> 17:23.983
You wanna run bribe me again?

17:23.992 --> 17:25.813
I give it away.

17:25.823 --> 17:27.923
What? What were you thinking?

17:27.933 --> 17:30.033
I just trying to be heroic.

17:30.043 --> 17:32.494
Oh, Jack.
I cant go trough this again.

17:32.595 --> 17:36.343
Not after your father.
- I’m not like him, mom.

17:36.453 --> 17:40.173
Oh Jack.
- I'm not.

18:21.082 --> 18:22.202
Hello.

18:25.513 --> 18:27.012
Excuse me.

18:34.022 --> 18:35.422
Of course.

18:37.832 --> 18:40.732
Hey, wait.
What happened to the pawn shop?

18:40.733 --> 18:43.632
I need to get my C.O.W back.

18:43.842 --> 18:48.242
See what's flock's blows in from the

18:48.243 --> 18:52.641
turbulent gale of this life.
- Huh?

18:53.551 --> 18:58.452
Have you drifted from your fated
path, young journey man? - Huh?

18:58.562 --> 19:00.382
Are you lost kid?

19:00.582 --> 19:05.581
No, I'm looking for the pawn shop.
it was right here, earlier today.

19:05.701 --> 19:12.201
Same place, same counter.
Hmph, weird.

19:13.411 --> 19:19.611
Indeed your words are cloudy,
as the highland winter Morse.

19:20.821 --> 19:23.021
What do you talking about?

19:23.031 --> 19:26.281
Look kid, I'm just trying to
give this thing a little color.

19:26.282 --> 19:29.531
Some vocabulary, okay?

19:30.041 --> 19:32.666
You'd think everything else are
sounds like a nursery rhymes?

19:32.667 --> 19:37.741
A thesaurus is not a kind of dinosaurs.
See what I mean?

19:37.751 --> 19:43.350
Oh, okay. Where for all
thus the establishment

19:43.351 --> 19:46.350
of the prefey and trading sale.

19:46.360 --> 19:48.460
What?
- The Pawn shop?

19:49.171 --> 19:53.671
Will you stop with the pawn shop?
There is no pawn shop, get over it.

19:54.481 --> 19:58.180
Great, just great. So hero.

19:59.190 --> 20:03.500
You're a hero? We don't get
many of those stories anymore.

20:03.501 --> 20:07.811
Nowadays its all graphic
novel and the...

20:07.821 --> 20:09.920
manga... manga... manga...

20:11.630 --> 20:15.130
but a real literature with
a real hero, excellent.

20:15.140 --> 20:19.040
So, what's your quest?
- Quest?

20:19.050 --> 20:22.850
Well, every hero needs a quest,
the great and worthy goal?

20:23.060 --> 20:25.680
Well, I don't have one.

20:27.090 --> 20:30.610
No problem, we'll see what's available.

20:34.919 --> 20:37.319
The Golden Flist

20:38.020 --> 20:39.419
Its been done.

20:42.130 --> 20:43.950
Arc of confident?

20:43.960 --> 20:47.459
Ah that reserved for the chap
with the head and the...

20:48.169 --> 20:49.989
Oh, he's great. Yeah.

20:51.299 --> 20:54.099
Atlantis? How long can
you hold your breath?

20:56.209 --> 20:57.330
No, no.

20:59.340 --> 21:04.139
The impossible dream. Do you sing it all?

21:08.749 --> 21:12.249
Well, there is not much
left, I mean there's the...

21:12.558 --> 21:19.059
Wait, ow no I don't think this
was for you, its too difficult.

21:19.769 --> 21:21.169
What is it?

21:21.579 --> 21:26.403
Well, its "Destiny Harp" the
golden harp that's been stolen

21:26.404 --> 21:29.428
and it needs to be return.
Its need a hero with

21:29.429 --> 21:32.579
a little more experience, short
of the sequel quest, really.

21:32.589 --> 21:33.989
I can do it.

21:34.599 --> 21:38.018
Well, I guess its up to you then.

21:57.328 --> 21:58.728
What is this?

21:58.738 --> 22:05.438
Everybody has a story, but only
a few are worthy of being told.

22:15.348 --> 22:17.167
One more thing...

22:19.577 --> 22:21.397
this is for you.

22:23.608 --> 22:25.008
Is this a key?

22:25.718 --> 22:27.538
What is it open?

22:27.548 --> 22:30.597
Well, maybe it'll open
something for you and

22:30.598 --> 22:33.023
you need it maybe a little close

22:33.024 --> 22:36.147
something for you as well one day.

22:36.157 --> 22:38.857
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

22:54.467 --> 23:00.067
Wait a second. This is our family crest.

23:05.477 --> 23:07.297
Why's the door lock?

23:09.106 --> 23:12.206
Hello? Is there anybody there?
Hello.

23:27.216 --> 23:29.316
Jack...

23:29.326 --> 23:31.427
did you get
the C.O.W back?

23:31.437 --> 23:34.936
I tried mom, but the store
changes into the book shop.

23:36.346 --> 23:38.166
And, what's that?

23:38.176 --> 23:41.676
Oh, the store owner give it to me
and he said it was a heroes quest.

23:41.686 --> 23:43.786
Again with the hero stuff.

23:47.496 --> 23:50.546
Your father wasn't a hero Jack.

23:50.547 --> 23:52.996
No matter what you may wanna believe...

23:53.006 --> 23:56.956
he talk all the time
about secret mission,

23:56.957 --> 24:00.905
saving damsel and spooring giants.

24:01.815 --> 24:04.316
But in the end, he just left us.

24:07.526 --> 24:09.626
Didn't you believe any of it?

24:09.736 --> 24:12.235
Well, there is the time...

24:15.945 --> 24:18.165
No, It was just stories.

24:18.875 --> 24:22.676
And he never came home,
that was no fairytale.

24:23.286 --> 24:27.185
We cant eat dreams Jack. I
wish we could but we cant.

24:27.895 --> 24:31.395
Don't worry mom, I'll help
out first thing tomorrow.

24:32.705 --> 24:36.605
Alright sweetheart.
- Good night.

24:48.415 --> 24:50.234
What was I thinking?

26:19.242 --> 26:20.643
What is that?

26:23.253 --> 26:24.653
Who's said that?

26:24.654 --> 26:26.753
Who said who said that?

26:27.063 --> 26:30.063
Who said who said who said that?

26:31.972 --> 26:37.072
It's me. I can talk. I'm a monster.

27:05.482 --> 27:08.382
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

27:08.392 --> 27:09.791
WAKE UP.

27:17.712 --> 27:19.112
Who are you?

27:19.122 --> 27:21.242

27:21.252 --> 27:23.351
Our goose?
- Freaky huh?

27:23.661 --> 27:25.061
You can talk?

27:25.171 --> 27:28.772
I can talk, I can walk, I can sing.

27:28.782 --> 27:32.832
<i>Wont you come home to belly,
wont you come home.</i>

27:32.833 --> 27:36.881
<i>I cry the whole night trough.</i>

27:38.791 --> 27:43.841
Well, I can talk and walk.
You see I... oh sorry.

27:43.842 --> 27:48.391
I ju...
Hey, how do I do that?

27:48.501 --> 27:50.521
What are these things?

27:50.531 --> 27:51.951
Thumbs.

27:51.961 --> 27:54.061
And I can do these with them?

27:55.271 --> 27:58.871
Wow, cool.

27:59.181 --> 28:01.300
What happened to you?

28:02.510 --> 28:06.311
Well, as far as I can see, I ate a bean.

28:10.321 --> 28:15.320
They were magic?
Of course, they were magic.

28:16.730 --> 28:21.531
So, if you're you... and the beans...

28:24.141 --> 28:25.261
Wow.

28:33.170 --> 28:35.270
Hey Jack, where you going?

28:38.781 --> 28:41.080
This maybe the coolest thing ever.

28:57.790 --> 29:01.340
The coolest?
Hello?

29:01.341 --> 29:04.889
Can it talk?
Can it do this?

29:06.399 --> 29:11.600
Hello, my name is tummy thumb
thumb-kins and I'm a principle.

29:11.910 --> 29:13.730
I can turn pages.

29:13.940 --> 29:17.060
Shh...
You hear that?

29:18.469 --> 29:20.689
Sounds like a harp?

29:22.199 --> 29:25.619
A harp? Destiny's harp.

29:26.629 --> 29:28.730
What are you talking about?

29:28.740 --> 29:30.139
Its my quest.

29:38.749 --> 29:43.248
Ah Jack. Wow, wow, Jack. Wow.

29:43.358 --> 29:45.379
What wow? Wow what?

29:45.389 --> 29:48.789
Jack begins climbing the magical beanstalk.

29:56.298 --> 29:58.398
It was right there, I swear it.

30:04.209 --> 30:06.029
Tell me what it says.

30:11.138 --> 30:13.588
Its doing it. Its doing it.

30:13.589 --> 30:16.814
Jack begins climbing
the magical beanstalk,

30:16.815 --> 30:21.438
thus begins his quest
for Destiny's Harp...

30:21.448 --> 30:24.448
Alright Grayson. Come on, let's go.

30:29.358 --> 30:30.758
Up, up there?

30:30.868 --> 30:32.268
Well, yeah.

30:32.578 --> 30:36.378
I... I don't think so.
I'm not good with high...

30:36.479 --> 30:40.078
and I'm not good with quest either.

30:40.088 --> 30:43.788
I have an old war quest injury.

30:43.798 --> 30:46.947
You know what, go up there,
take plenty of pictures,

30:46.948 --> 30:50.497
send me a post card and
give my love for the Harp.

30:50.707 --> 30:54.958
You know what, you're right.
Why don't you stay down there

30:54.959 --> 30:57.608
and look out for
the big bad wolf, okay.

30:57.718 --> 30:58.838
Wolf?

31:01.147 --> 31:04.597
Don't you just love climbing Jack?

31:04.598 --> 31:08.047
Got my helmet, got my rope.
Ha ha.

31:10.157 --> 31:14.157
A beanstalk, this is just what I need.

31:18.467 --> 31:21.487
Hey Grayson. I could see
our house from here.

31:23.097 --> 31:26.616
Oh, that's nice.

31:28.927 --> 31:33.327
Can I go downs there get
some worm on the way.

31:42.236 --> 31:46.137
Jack, would you slow
down a second, please...

32:04.146 --> 32:05.896
Hey.

32:05.897 --> 32:12.446
I can't hold on much longer.
I'm so cold, I have me bumps.

32:13.356 --> 32:17.255
You're a goose, you could always fly.

32:17.665 --> 32:22.266
Oh yes, that's a good idea.
If its were yesterday.

32:22.576 --> 32:25.876
But you could use the thumbs.

32:29.076 --> 32:30.475
What do you say?

32:31.685 --> 32:33.505
I would an output.

32:52.616 --> 32:54.016
What now?

32:54.325 --> 32:57.075
I wanna see if there is
any mention of breakfast.

32:57.176 --> 33:03.425
You know, like some bacon,
fish brown, waffles maybe.

33:04.235 --> 33:06.055
Oh, here its come.

33:06.965 --> 33:12.465
Climbing the beanstalk probability
cold and held many other hardships.

33:14.875 --> 33:17.475
Hardships? That's plural.

33:17.885 --> 33:21.784
Why cant it just be one hardships,
its a bunch of hardships.

33:21.894 --> 33:26.845
Nothing in the book that
says Grayson makes some a

33:26.846 --> 33:31.095
bangle of smears, a cup of
coffee and everything's fine.

33:31.105 --> 33:33.204
How many hardships can it be?

33:36.114 --> 33:38.334
Hey fellas, remember me?

33:43.244 --> 33:44.845
Define irony.

33:46.554 --> 33:49.054
I'll get you for that, Maury.

33:55.964 --> 33:57.364
We've made it.

34:16.873 --> 34:17.994
Let go.

34:18.004 --> 34:22.204
I'm trying but my thumbs
have the mind of their own.

34:22.304 --> 34:24.402
And I think that maybe stupid.

34:24.713 --> 34:26.833
OK, on three. Ready.

34:27.543 --> 34:30.143
One... three.

34:34.152 --> 34:36.373
What happened to two?

34:41.983 --> 34:43.382
Where are we?

34:43.592 --> 34:45.612
now, let me check.

34:47.422 --> 34:53.723
Okay, ah Jack and Grayson.
Grayson?

34:53.724 --> 34:57.523
I'm in the book, I'm the
literary character. he he.

34:57.633 --> 35:04.232
Jack and Grayson find themselves in
the maze Kingdom of the evil giant.

35:04.242 --> 35:07.392
You see, I'm in the...

35:07.393 --> 35:11.443
with the evil...
ooh, crud.

35:14.852 --> 35:16.672
There it is again.

35:17.282 --> 35:20.282
Come on Grayson, let's go.

35:36.792 --> 35:40.591
Come on Grayson. Let's go this way.

35:45.002 --> 35:50.622
Jack. Jaaack. Jack?

36:10.431 --> 36:14.431
Jack? NO-

36:34.441 --> 36:36.541
Excuse me.
- Please all speak up.

36:36.551 --> 36:38.301
Excuse me.

36:38.302 --> 36:42.951
Raise your voice, he's probably deaf.
Scream it out louder.

36:42.961 --> 36:45.760
Just scream it out.
- EXCUSE ME.

36:46.770 --> 36:49.690
Is that Destiny's Harp?

36:54.511 --> 36:57.460
I cant believe you scream
it out on the old man,

36:57.461 --> 36:59.910
you make him cry.
What's the mat... kids.

37:02.020 --> 37:05.020
Sir, I'm sorry I didn't mean to yell.

37:05.030 --> 37:07.981
Its not that, its just you said that word.

37:08.482 --> 37:10.530
You know that word?

37:10.540 --> 37:12.360
Destiny's harp?

37:19.100 --> 37:20.500
Is that it?

37:21.010 --> 37:25.610
No no, this is just a cheap imitation.

37:30.220 --> 37:32.040
This is beautiful.

37:32.350 --> 37:36.449
Well it should be, he's a master craftsman.

37:36.459 --> 37:41.059
See, it made by the
legendary stradaberries.

37:41.269 --> 37:46.370
No, that's not it.
- But its says right here, Stradaberries.

37:46.380 --> 37:49.999
My name is Very Saddius.

37:52.809 --> 37:59.110
Oh, yeah.
Well he's well-known to... I guess.

37:59.120 --> 38:02.539
How I love my Destiny...

38:02.549 --> 38:07.249
Yeah, I love my destiny too.
I only wish I knew what my destiny was.

38:07.259 --> 38:10.009
One minute, I'm a goose.

38:10.010 --> 38:14.058
I was wondering around picking
at worms, everything's great.

38:14.368 --> 38:19.069
Then I wake up and I've got
this face, its hideous...

38:19.579 --> 38:23.879
No, its not that destiny.
Destiny is my granddaughter.

38:24.289 --> 38:26.408
She was always a harp.

38:33.219 --> 38:39.318
She was a beautiful little girl, with the
voice that good make the angles weep.

38:39.828 --> 38:42.978
She was the light of my heart...

38:42.979 --> 38:46.728
until the giant heard her singing...

38:47.838 --> 38:50.859
and wanted the songs for himself.

38:54.468 --> 38:57.068
Oh Giant its evil.

38:58.778 --> 39:02.098
He plunders everything he want.

39:14.508 --> 39:16.928
He took my Destiny...

39:18.337 --> 39:21.457
Sing for me... Sing.

39:21.467 --> 39:22.587
Never.

39:22.597 --> 39:25.398
She was use to sing for the brute.

39:25.508 --> 39:29.882
So he using the last of the stolen poison,

39:29.883 --> 39:33.857
he cast a spell and turn her into

39:33.858 --> 39:36.307
a Golden Harp.

39:42.318 --> 39:48.617
I tried to rescue her so many others
but nobody can defeat the giant.

39:48.627 --> 39:54.527
That's why, I tried to make another
harp to exchange for her.

39:56.336 --> 39:58.937
Ask him one question and
he tells you a story,

39:58.938 --> 40:01.537
it was like a three half an hours long.

40:02.047 --> 40:05.447
Excuse me, ah how's the harp going?

40:09.247 --> 40:10.646
Okay.

40:10.656 --> 40:12.856
So, where is Des...

40:15.066 --> 40:16.887
...the harp now.

40:17.197 --> 40:22.296
The giants has her in the castle,
keeps it under a lock and a key.

40:22.306 --> 40:25.106
Come on, we headed to the castle.

40:25.116 --> 40:31.416
No, no. Don't you understand?
The maze is fill with puzzles and problems.

40:31.426 --> 40:34.226
And the giants knows everybody whose in it.

40:34.236 --> 40:38.536
There are only two kind of
people who attempt this.

40:39.246 --> 40:43.266
A hero or a lunatic.

40:43.476 --> 40:47.875
Don't worry, between the two of us,
I think we got that covered.

40:50.286 --> 40:53.486
We bring her back. I promise.

40:54.387 --> 40:56.207
Come on Grayson...

40:56.496 --> 41:00.495
Come on Grayson.
He's ordered me around, he's stup...

41:10.706 --> 41:11.616

41:23.546 --> 41:27.345
Coming trough.
- Science gone mad, that's what that is.

41:27.355 --> 41:31.855
Pesticide, Herbicide, Growth hormones.

41:31.865 --> 41:33.985
This is nature's fury.

41:33.995 --> 41:36.715
Yeah, or a magic beans.

41:37.125 --> 41:41.775
Oh yeah, obviously nature
fury or magic beans.

41:41.876 --> 41:45.025
I think its nice.

41:45.035 --> 41:48.235
Yeah, either way you know what its means.

41:48.845 --> 41:51.264
Trouble?
- Its couple or less.

41:51.274 --> 41:53.094
Tea?
- Thank you.

41:53.104 --> 41:55.304
Its like a big stick of broccoli.

41:55.314 --> 41:58.515

43:02.043 --> 43:05.593
There's my little song bird.

43:06.695 --> 43:10.243
Don't change your tune for me.

43:10.353 --> 43:13.403
That was a song of hope a moments ago.

If you wanna go back, I understand...

44:49.801 --> 44:50.921
No...

44:53.131 --> 44:54.251
Hey.

44:54.461 --> 44:57.261
What's in limit you change your mind?

44:59.171 --> 45:00.991
Tap a pages 51.

45:07.401 --> 45:09.501
Jack and his best friend Grayson.

45:11.411 --> 45:13.511
Never been a best-friend before.

45:19.620 --> 45:24.621
Okay, well... look likes
the hard part's behind us.

45:25.431 --> 45:26.551
Hey...

45:30.660 --> 45:32.760
Oh crud. This doesn't look good.

45:33.870 --> 45:37.570
The giants thought he might
sends a little welcoming party.

45:37.580 --> 45:43.080
Oh... a party?
I was scared for a minute, but a party.

45:43.090 --> 45:47.290
We'll had some cakes, some ice cream,
they'll make balloon animal.

45:47.300 --> 45:51.300
And maybe we'll sing
karaoke and then go home.

45:54.119 --> 45:56.920
Not really the kind of party had in mind.

45:56.930 --> 46:01.430
I think I'll leave you and your
new friends to get acquaintance.

46:56.139 --> 46:58.238
Oh, that's gotta be painful.

47:01.448 --> 47:03.968
Shut up, get him.

48:10.177 --> 48:12.277
Hey, that's a goose feather.

48:16.287 --> 48:18.107
Twister, uh...

49:06.916 --> 49:10.916
Daddy, you've come home.
- What?

49:13.426 --> 49:16.226

- Err, nothing. Nothing at all.

49:21.936 --> 49:25.236
Wow, that was fantastic.
I mean, you've save us.

49:39.376 --> 49:44.375

49:54.796 --> 49:59.795
I'm a goose, why is that so hard
for people? - This is Grayson.

50:01.105 --> 50:04.705
So, who were those guys anyway?

50:04.715 --> 50:07.565
That?
That was Dobbytok.

50:07.566 --> 50:09.814
The Giant number one
and his brute squad.

50:10.124 --> 50:13.625
You guys must have the giant
pretty worried if he send them.

50:14.235 --> 50:17.735
The giant is worried about us?

50:17.736 --> 50:20.535
Hah, punk better be...

50:21.044 --> 50:25.044
Now he's gonna be mad.
Look, we have to go in fast.

50:25.054 --> 50:27.504
These scariest bubble Meany
will be back with a

50:27.505 --> 50:30.955
greater number and with something
more than just pillows.

50:30.965 --> 50:32.365
Follow me.

50:33.175 --> 50:36.774
Wait, I got a bad feeling about this.

50:37.684 --> 50:43.584
Ah, sorry sister but, we're on
a ultra top secret mission.

50:43.794 --> 50:49.094
Yeah, to get a Destiny's harp.
- How did you know that?

50:49.104 --> 50:51.904
Entire Kingdoms knows, I can help you.

50:52.114 --> 50:56.814
Look, we appreciate your help and all
lad, but we got this under control.

50:56.824 --> 51:01.373
I mean aside
from her dazzling ability with

51:01.374 --> 51:06.124
bedroom furnishing, what
could she really do for us?

51:09.034 --> 51:11.434
This is the magical
kingdom of Taliot which

51:11.435 --> 51:13.833
you ever reach by climbing
a magical beanstalk.

51:13.843 --> 51:17.193
The giant terrorizes this land
for over 30 years, kidnap Destiny,

51:17.194 --> 51:20.544
the daughter of Very Saddius
so he can trump his stone maze

51:20.554 --> 51:24.054
in return of earning his granddaughter
which he turn her into the magical harp

51:24.064 --> 51:27.563
that he keeps lock away in a trump
that can be only open by two keys,

51:27.573 --> 51:29.773
one of it Giant wear
it under his neck and

51:29.774 --> 51:31.973
the second which hanging
in the crystal cave.

51:31.983 --> 51:34.233
Oh and I've been notice
the maze like the back in

51:34.234 --> 51:36.984
my hand and I have the
scar in my right thumb.

51:38.693 --> 51:39.813
Wow.

51:40.723 --> 51:42.123
So?

51:42.124 --> 51:44.323
And a peanut butter jelly sandwiches.

51:44.333 --> 51:47.833
<i>Peanut butter jelly tud...

51:47.843 --> 51:49.503
Okay.

51:49.504 --> 51:51.862

51:53.973 --> 51:58.173
<i>Peanut butter jelly, peanut butter jelly...
Peanut butter jelly with a baseball bat.</i>

51:58.183 --> 52:02.383
<i>Peanut butter jelly, peanut butter jelly...
Peanut butter jelly with a baseball bat.</i>

52:02.393 --> 52:04.392
<i>Peanut butter jelly, peanut butter jelly...
Peanut butter jelly with a baseball bat.</i>

52:04.402 --> 52:08.402
OKAY!
- He takes away my big musical number...

52:21.912 --> 52:23.732
She's amazing huh?

52:24.542 --> 52:30.642
I don't know if I used the term amazing,
I bet might not be the first thing I...

52:30.652 --> 52:35.752
I mean look even on the book
it wouldn't call her amazing.

52:35.762 --> 52:41.361
I mean look here... a-amazing.
Oh... crud...

52:44.071 --> 52:47.572
May I have your attention
please, thank you.

52:47.682 --> 52:51.832
The town counsel has
unanimously decided this...

52:53.333 --> 52:54.695
a beanstalk...

52:54.696 --> 52:57.681
it look
technically green-space.

52:57.691 --> 53:01.391
And maybe a treat to our security
so we'll going to cop it down.

53:02.302 --> 53:05.717
Sir, my son is up there.

53:05.718 --> 53:09.131
If you cop it down, he'll
be trap with no way home.

53:09.141 --> 53:11.241
Your son is up there?
- Yes.

53:11.251 --> 53:13.351
Right here?
- No, he's there.

53:14.061 --> 53:15.881
Oh madam, I'm so sorry.

53:15.891 --> 53:17.991
Thank you.

53:17.992 --> 53:22.791
Hopefully sorry for this, its unbelievably
sacrifice you make on behalf of the town.

53:22.801 --> 53:26.401
You're a good woman. Heroic and brave.

53:27.411 --> 53:29.231
Bring in a lumberjack.

53:29.241 --> 53:33.440
Oh no, you cant do that. Please.
- I just did. I said bring in a lumberjack.

53:33.450 --> 53:35.900
NO, you cant do that.

53:35.901 --> 53:39.451
No, I can do it. I have the order as a
mayor, I would bring the city counsel.

53:39.461 --> 53:42.561
No please don't hug the thing,
there's nothing to see...

53:42.562 --> 53:44.661
bring me a lumberjack.
- No.

53:52.070 --> 53:54.891
Hold. Who goes there?

53:54.901 --> 53:57.421
Us.
- Friend or foe?

53:57.730 --> 53:59.750
Friend.
- Foe?

54:00.060 --> 54:01.460
No, friend.

54:04.270 --> 54:05.670
Go away.

54:09.080 --> 54:12.080
I mean it, beat it, scram, get lost.

54:12.090 --> 54:17.010
Is this the center of the maze?
- No.

54:17.020 --> 54:19.740
Are you sure?
- No.

54:19.950 --> 54:23.099
I get it, its opposite day right?

54:24.200 --> 54:25.849
No.

54:25.859 --> 54:26.909
Haha, I knew it.

54:27.511 --> 54:29.060
He said no.

54:29.570 --> 54:32.770
Which means "yes" right?
- No.

54:33.080 --> 54:37.379
Is everything opposite?
- Not as far as you know.

54:37.989 --> 54:41.889
This is not right Jack, come on.
- No, Wait a second.

54:42.699 --> 54:46.700
We're looking for a Destiny's harp.
- Never heard of it.

54:47.210 --> 54:51.609
Great, that's mean he knows all about it.
- This is silly Jack, come on.

54:51.719 --> 54:55.819
We heard you needed a key to set it free.
- Its pack a lies.

54:56.229 --> 54:58.829
Good, so we goes straight trough the maze.

54:59.230 --> 55:00.929
No.
- Good.

55:00.939 --> 55:04.839
It's not on the other side of the maze.
- Its not.

55:05.049 --> 55:10.249
Yes. - Wait, yes to its not or
its not not on the other side?

55:10.259 --> 55:12.079
- Yes.
- No.
- Right.

55:12.089 --> 55:15.488
- I'm lost.
- You just gotta think backwards.

55:15.998 --> 55:17.818
Or stupid.
- Hey.

55:18.829 --> 55:24.429
You cant get there from here.
- Oh perfect. So how do we do it?

55:24.439 --> 55:27.088
Well, don't keep to the
left and you wont find an

55:27.089 --> 55:29.738
iron door which doesn't
lead to the crystal cave.

55:29.748 --> 55:34.373
Fine, so we stay left and
leads us trough an iron door

55:34.374 --> 55:39.698
that take us to the crystal cave where we
find a key that set us free, right?

55:39.708 --> 55:41.528
Wrong.
- Right.

55:41.538 --> 55:43.358
- Wrong.
- Right.

55:43.368 --> 55:45.188
It's a piece of cake.

55:45.198 --> 55:49.498
Ah, its a piece a cake.
It's easy, its a...

55:49.499 --> 55:53.098
wait a minute, you
said piece of cake?

55:53.208 --> 55:54.908
Piece of cake.

55:55.318 --> 56:03.118
- Are there nasty things on the other side?
- No, not at all. None... none... no.

56:05.227 --> 56:06.627
Oh crud...

56:06.637 --> 56:09.387
Well, you all seems to fail a test.
So, go on.

56:09.388 --> 56:12.138
Find the golden key, enjoy.

56:12.548 --> 56:15.568
Thank you?
- Bite me.

56:16.078 --> 56:21.177
Did you see what he..
he said don't. Its not up...

56:23.187 --> 56:26.287
So long... We have something bananas...

56:29.398 --> 56:33.897
Hey, we gotta go left.
- Its not the way jack. This way.

56:34.207 --> 56:38.907
No no. he said don't go left
and if he said don't go left,

56:38.908 --> 56:42.907
we go left because its opposite day.

56:42.917 --> 56:45.367
I'm sorry, how would you know?

56:45.368 --> 56:50.917
Beside maybe its the totally
honest day or trick the idiot day.

56:50.927 --> 56:53.377
Look Jack, its dangerous in here and

56:53.378 --> 56:56.027
do you really wants to risk
your life to a chicken?

56:56.037 --> 56:57.856
Hey.
- Come on.

57:02.967 --> 57:06.467
No wait, wait.
Here, let's see what the books says.

57:08.077 --> 57:15.376
The trio headed into the maze
uncertain of what lay ahead.

57:16.086 --> 57:18.887
Oh, this is not time for cliffhanger.

57:20.497 --> 57:25.296
Oh, I really don't need that guy right now.

57:25.906 --> 57:29.006
Have a nice day. Not, haha.

57:30.216 --> 57:33.116
Okay, what's with the book?

57:33.126 --> 57:34.525
Its my story.

57:34.936 --> 57:38.056
You have a real story?
- Well, yeah.

57:38.566 --> 57:41.266
It mean its record everything you do?

57:41.267 --> 57:43.966
Everyone you meet and
what they doing stuff?

57:44.776 --> 57:49.175
Oh, follow me. I'm the cute girl,
I'm a little Miss Perfect.

57:49.176 --> 57:53.576
I'll be your best friend,
I'll save you from pillows.

57:53.586 --> 57:58.886
And make everyone puke.
- What is your problem?

57:59.096 --> 58:02.595
I don't have a problem, I'm
perfect, I'm Mr. Perfect.

58:05.305 --> 58:09.656
Here we go, as they travel
the maze, Grayson was

58:09.657 --> 58:14.005
filled with envious thought
and burning with jealousy.

58:14.715 --> 58:18.615
Even though he had eaten the most
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

58:19.025 --> 58:21.825
First of all, I only had three.
- Four.

58:22.135 --> 58:25.634
Alright, four the most but that what
point of view that book taking.

58:26.045 --> 58:30.495
Look, if she's so wonderful,
how come she doesn't

58:30.496 --> 58:34.945
have her own story?
Why she has to be in us?

58:35.255 --> 58:37.355
Maybe she's the bloody sidekick.

58:37.765 --> 58:39.864
I'm the bloody sidekick.

58:40.274 --> 58:42.094
Maybe I'm the hero.

58:42.604 --> 58:46.605
Maybe she's the bad guy in disguise.
- What?

58:46.715 --> 58:49.215
MAYBE SHE'S THE BAD...
- Shh...

58:49.225 --> 58:51.044
I'm not the bad guy.

58:51.054 --> 58:54.004
See, that's what the bad guy
always said and then

58:54.005 --> 58:56.954
they follow it up by
going "I'm really not".

58:56.964 --> 58:59.664
I'M REALLY NOT...
- See...

59:00.675 --> 59:04.674
She could be leading us into a trap.
- What?

59:05.084 --> 59:06.904
I won't leave her.

59:08.514 --> 59:11.814
Okay, we get it Jack.
You're not like

59:11.815 --> 59:15.114
your father and maybe
that's the problem.

59:16.523 --> 59:21.224
You see, every hero has a tragic
flaw that leads him to defeat.

59:21.734 --> 59:25.734
Hamlet was a flippy flop and
Killy had the foot thing and...

59:28.644 --> 59:34.644
You trying so hard not to be your
father that... your gonna fail.

59:35.654 --> 59:37.474
I'm not a failure.

59:38.784 --> 59:40.884
Come on Jillian. Let's go.

59:42.193 --> 59:44.713
I... I didn't... Wait...

59:50.623 --> 59:52.024
<i>Over here...</i>

59:53.434 --> 59:57.133
Did you hear that? What was that?

59:57.143 --> 59:58.263
<i>Jack...</i>

59:58.273 --> 59:59.673
It's nothing.

59:59.683 --> 01:00:01.083
Follow me.

01:00:04.393 --> 01:00:06.213
No, no... We supp...

01:00:08.523 --> 01:00:09.923
<i>This way...</i>

01:00:09.933 --> 01:00:11.333
Hey, wait up.

01:00:13.343 --> 01:00:14.743
What is this?

01:00:18.153 --> 01:00:23.272
<i>JACK...</i>

01:00:24.382 --> 01:00:26.103
<i>JACK...</i>

01:00:30.013 --> 01:00:32.813
Oh crud...
- Let's get out of here.

01:00:35.722 --> 01:00:37.542
Come on, let's go back.

01:00:38.252 --> 01:00:43.653
<i>We have you Jack, join us...</i>

01:00:48.962 --> 01:00:51.862
No, not me...

01:00:57.772 --> 01:01:00.492
Jack, try to get out.

01:01:01.302 --> 01:01:03.122
Its all over us.

01:01:08.032 --> 01:01:09.932
The book.
Throw me the book.

01:01:09.942 --> 01:01:12.041
What?
- Throw me the book.

01:01:12.051 --> 01:01:14.851
If I rip the pages we could start over.

01:01:14.861 --> 01:01:17.862
Jack, you cant...
- The book now...

01:01:20.472 --> 01:01:24.371
Jack, its the clues everything.
- Throw it.

01:01:24.881 --> 01:01:26.301
Got it.

01:01:32.211 --> 01:01:35.232
<i>Jack, over here...</i>

01:01:35.742 --> 01:01:37.461
<i>Jack...</i>

01:01:37.671 --> 01:01:39.271
What'd you do?

01:01:46.281 --> 01:01:49.780
It will be dark soon,
we should camp for the night.

01:01:51.791 --> 01:01:53.191
This way.

01:02:01.301 --> 01:02:03.400
Yeah, like I'm sure that way safe.

01:02:37.110 --> 01:02:39.210
What are you?
- Lumberjacks.

01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:41.039
What you do?
- Chop...

01:02:42.850 --> 01:02:44.950
What are you?
- Lumberjacks.

01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:47.180
What you do?
- Chop...

01:02:47.890 --> 01:02:49.990
What are you?
- Lumberjacks.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.820
What you do?
- Chop...

01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:56.779
Excuse me, hey fellas.
Um, actually I don't chop.

01:02:57.780 --> 01:02:59.630
What?

01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:05.140
I always rather like trees there
barky goodies there leafy fooliets.

01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:09.349
Rather in the middle of something here.
- I never want to be a lumberjack anyway.

01:03:09.559 --> 01:03:12.759
I always wanted to do something
different with my life.

01:03:12.769 --> 01:03:14.869
Oh what did you want to be?

01:03:15.379 --> 01:03:18.180
I wish want to be...
- What? What?

01:03:18.490 --> 01:03:21.289
I wish want to be...
- Say it man...

01:03:21.299 --> 01:03:22.349
A pet store owner.

01:03:23.850 --> 01:03:24.899
What?

01:03:25.009 --> 01:03:31.409
Yes, hug-able dogs, hamsters, little
rabbits and the old witch in blue parrot.

01:03:31.918 --> 01:03:34.619
Would you get rid of him.
- Get rid of him.

01:03:34.729 --> 01:03:37.249
<i>We shall not be move...</i>

01:03:38.350 --> 01:03:40.170
What is it now.

01:03:40.259 --> 01:03:42.659
<i>We shall, we shall not be move...</i>

01:03:42.669 --> 01:03:48.168
<i>We shall... We shall not be move...</i>

01:03:54.079 --> 01:03:59.078
That's it. The iron gate.
Just like the opposite guy didn't say.

01:04:01.088 --> 01:04:03.188
Yeah, good job its in here...

01:04:09.998 --> 01:04:11.818
Its dark, come on...

01:04:12.428 --> 01:04:14.248
Hello?

01:04:15.858 --> 01:04:17.678
Hello, anybody here?

01:04:23.988 --> 01:04:28.288
Its a three inch door.
Who build a three inch door?

01:04:32.298 --> 01:04:39.497
- Grayson, I cant see anything.
- Owh, who turn off the lights?

01:04:39.507 --> 01:04:43.008
Hold on, I saw this once
in a infirmary shop.

01:04:44.018 --> 01:04:46.118
Jillian, are you alright?

01:04:48.827 --> 01:04:51.102
Oh great, two keys.

01:04:51.103 --> 01:04:53.377
It would have to be two
keys that can make

01:04:53.378 --> 01:04:56.453
an easy like have one key there and

01:04:56.454 --> 01:04:59.528
the sign that says "take this key".

01:04:59.738 --> 01:05:04.337
Well, let's see opposite guy
said take the Golden Key.

01:05:04.747 --> 01:05:10.547
So, it's easy. No, its opposite
guy so that's mean its opposite

01:05:10.557 --> 01:05:14.556
therefore we take the silver key
cause he said the golden key

01:05:14.566 --> 01:05:18.567
and we could take that but I guess
that's mean something else.

01:05:19.877 --> 01:05:23.177
You understand?
- Not really.

01:05:25.687 --> 01:05:28.886
But Jillian said take
the Golden Key right?

01:05:28.887 --> 01:05:32.087
Oh yeah, and Jillian's your friend.

01:05:38.797 --> 01:05:39.916
JACK!

01:05:47.026 --> 01:05:48.847
Let's get out of here.

01:05:51.057 --> 01:05:53.156
Oh these are the strong bars.

01:05:53.966 --> 01:05:58.066
Yeah, great friend-men-ship.
Don't worry we'll never get out of here.

01:06:05.475 --> 01:06:12.476
Bee, five four thumbs...
I smell the blood of an Englishman.

01:06:13.286 --> 01:06:14.686
The Giant.

01:06:14.696 --> 01:06:18.895
Well I, technically I'm
not English or a man.

01:06:19.205 --> 01:06:25.506
I'm an frantic Roman and I think I maybe a
quarter Italian on my mother's side.

01:06:31.115 --> 01:06:34.615
Grayson.
- What? Like you never been scared and...

01:06:35.925 --> 01:06:37.745
What have we here.

01:06:44.855 --> 01:06:47.655
Ah, you might wanna rinse that off.

01:06:49.965 --> 01:06:54.485
- Ewwww....
- 14 karats.

01:06:54.695 --> 01:06:57.795
From me? I'm on a low fiber diet.

01:06:59.805 --> 01:07:02.605
I thought you are a guy.
- I am a guy.

01:07:02.615 --> 01:07:06.515
Guys cant lay eggs.
- We'll take agenda.

01:07:06.525 --> 01:07:10.024
Oh, this swan lays an
Golden eggs, Dobbytok.

01:07:10.334 --> 01:07:12.654
I'm a goose, a goose...

01:07:12.664 --> 01:07:14.885
Get him.
- Okay...

01:07:16.295 --> 01:07:17.695
Come here.

01:07:20.305 --> 01:07:21.704
Let him go...

01:07:21.714 --> 01:07:25.214
Did you really think you could beat me?

01:07:25.524 --> 01:07:28.124
Little nobody like you.

01:07:30.034 --> 01:07:32.835
Just who do you think you are? Boy...

01:07:34.344 --> 01:07:38.364
Now... what about you?

01:07:40.574 --> 01:07:43.374
Don't even think about it dog breath.

01:07:43.384 --> 01:07:46.734
Ah, he doesn't know.

01:07:46.735 --> 01:07:50.084
He doesn't know.
He doesn't know.

01:07:51.194 --> 01:07:52.594
Know what?

01:07:56.904 --> 01:08:00.403
Jack, I tried to tell you.

01:08:01.513 --> 01:08:04.313
You brought him here,
just like you promise.

01:08:08.024 --> 01:08:09.424
You set us up.

01:08:10.734 --> 01:08:13.733
I did, but I had a really good reason.

01:08:13.743 --> 01:08:17.743
I really did, just listen to me.
Please, Jack.

01:08:19.053 --> 01:08:21.853
Night night.
- Please, Jack.

01:08:22.063 --> 01:08:23.663
Jack...

01:08:37.073 --> 01:08:38.892
Get in here, Ducky.

01:08:41.803 --> 01:08:43.203
Lock the door.

01:08:45.904 --> 01:08:47.303
Wait...

01:08:52.511 --> 01:08:54.112
I did what you ask.

01:08:54.122 --> 01:08:57.622
We had a deal, you bring me Jack

01:08:57.633 --> 01:08:59.933
and I give you your father.

01:09:04.242 --> 01:09:07.942
And I am a Giant of my word.

01:09:09.152 --> 01:09:10.971
Dobbytok.
- Got it.

01:09:14.383 --> 01:09:16.482
Yes boss.
- Get the father.

01:09:16.492 --> 01:09:19.992
Oh yeah, father. Will do.
Yes, I'll get the father.

01:09:33.902 --> 01:09:35.721
Hello.

01:09:36.032 --> 01:09:37.432
No father.

01:09:41.242 --> 01:09:44.741
Take him, the old fool
escape months ago,

01:09:44.751 --> 01:09:47.852
found the escape route
to the world below.

01:09:47.862 --> 01:09:51.362
He got away but we crush the
other prisoner who help him.

01:09:51.372 --> 01:09:56.571
And guess what?
Now, I have his daughter.

01:09:56.581 --> 01:10:00.881
No, no. Let go of me.
- Take her away.

01:10:00.891 --> 01:10:04.392
We had a deal Giant, you lied.

01:10:04.402 --> 01:10:07.401
You lied to me. Get off me.

01:10:07.511 --> 01:10:10.711
Take her.
- No, you lied.

01:10:11.321 --> 01:10:14.621
Your a liar. Get off me
you big green idiot.

01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:22.641
We have to get rid the
beanstalk from the

01:10:22.651 --> 01:10:24.951
terror over there do
not come down here.

01:10:25.061 --> 01:10:28.661
Chop her out too... Chop... Chop...

01:10:28.671 --> 01:10:31.791
Chop... Chop... Chop...

01:10:44.201 --> 01:10:47.200
Hello, can anybody hear me?

01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:50.430
Hello? Is not used.

01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:14.960
Get off me...

01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:21.870
Get in there.

01:11:23.371 --> 01:11:26.869
Lock the door.
Bye-bye...

01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:49.699
Jack, I...
- Don't...

01:11:52.009 --> 01:11:55.509
but I really wanna explain.
- Just shut up okay.

01:12:02.218 --> 01:12:04.039
Lay another egg.

01:12:10.349 --> 01:12:13.269
LAY ANOTHER EGG.

01:12:14.279 --> 01:12:17.078
Look, maybe it was a one time deal.

01:12:17.088 --> 01:12:23.189
We could try the "Lamaze" method.
You know... encourage and support.

01:12:23.199 --> 01:12:25.299
...encourage and support.

01:12:25.309 --> 01:12:26.709
JUST DO IT!

01:12:36.918 --> 01:12:41.638
Mm, believable. Good.

01:12:50.548 --> 01:12:54.497
Look, Jack...
I really didn't mean for this

01:12:54.498 --> 01:12:58.048
to happen,
if only you knew why.

01:12:58.058 --> 01:13:00.608
If the Giant's lucky,
that's the lucky do.

01:13:01.609 --> 01:13:03.958
I'm not a lucky.

01:13:31.068 --> 01:13:32.887
<i>Once upon a time.</i>

01:13:39.197 --> 01:13:43.047
<i>There was a girl name
Jillian who wanted</i>

01:13:43.048 --> 01:13:46.897
<i>to be the greatest hero of all time.</i>

01:13:48.707 --> 01:13:51.807
<i>But her father was capture
by The evil giant...</i>

01:13:56.617 --> 01:14:00.316
I did whatever I had
to save my father,

01:14:00.317 --> 01:14:04.517
I didn't care how I
did it or who I hurt.

01:14:09.027 --> 01:14:12.926
Then now I see it, there just so much

01:14:12.927 --> 01:14:15.426
more being a hero than
just what you do.

01:14:17.836 --> 01:14:19.656
Its who you are.

01:14:22.267 --> 01:14:23.176
Right.

01:14:25.777 --> 01:14:26.686
Wait...

01:14:28.096 --> 01:14:34.096
No, I rather to be anything in
your story than a hero on my own.

01:14:36.605 --> 01:14:40.106
You've shouldn't done that,
now my story wont be told.

01:14:41.516 --> 01:14:42.916
I failed.

01:14:47.626 --> 01:14:51.125
Jack, a hero only a failure if
you end the story too soon.

01:14:53.035 --> 01:14:55.136
I wanna help you and Very Saddius.

01:14:55.446 --> 01:14:58.946
And I'll go down to the beanstalk
in search of my father.

01:15:01.755 --> 01:15:03.575
What do you say jack?

01:15:07.885 --> 01:15:13.386
Okay, let's do it.
- Okay.

01:15:14.395 --> 01:15:17.595
So, okay.

01:15:17.605 --> 01:15:20.405
We need try to
find a way out of here.

01:15:22.315 --> 01:15:25.815
We need to find something to
pick the lock, okay. - Okay.

01:15:33.825 --> 01:15:36.625
Unbelievable.
- Did you find something?

01:15:39.334 --> 01:15:42.934
Its a family crest.
Do you know it?

01:15:47.045 --> 01:15:48.165
Dad...

01:16:00.074 --> 01:16:02.175
Its mine, my family crest.

01:16:12.784 --> 01:16:15.334
<i>The old fool escape months ago,</i>

01:16:15.335 --> 01:16:17.983
<i>found the escape route to the world below.</i>

01:16:18.293 --> 01:16:21.794
<i>He got away but I crush the
other prisoner who help him.</i>

01:16:21.804 --> 01:16:23.924
<i>...crush the other prisoner who help him.</i>

01:16:33.433 --> 01:16:35.308
Jack...

01:16:37.710 --> 01:16:39.584
I think I know what
happened to your father.

01:16:44.284 --> 01:16:46.033
He really was a hero.

01:16:47.443 --> 01:16:53.644
But, he's gone now
and I'm so sorry...

01:16:54.354 --> 01:16:59.753
I'm really sorry...
- No... No...

01:17:02.263 --> 01:17:03.663
...the giant?

01:17:32.473 --> 01:17:33.872
What's this?

01:17:35.782 --> 01:17:37.882
I can really forgot about that.

01:17:41.292 --> 01:17:45.893
We can use the wire from
these, to pick a lock. - Cool.

01:17:55.002 --> 01:17:58.422
You don't think.
- What?

01:18:02.732 --> 01:18:04.132
Weird...

01:18:24.742 --> 01:18:26.141
Come on.

01:18:26.451 --> 01:18:28.171
Shhh.

01:18:29.681 --> 01:18:31.781
Jack. Jack.

01:18:35.291 --> 01:18:37.112
Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:18:37.122 --> 01:18:39.941
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:18:40.351 --> 01:18:43.851
Look, its locked.

01:18:44.261 --> 01:18:47.061
You better try to get out
while you still can.

01:18:47.971 --> 01:18:49.791
I'm not leaving you.

01:18:49.901 --> 01:18:53.701
Jack, for the last time.
You're not your father.

01:18:55.611 --> 01:18:56.731
I am...

01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:10.441
What?

01:19:12.851 --> 01:19:14.471
Where did you get that?

01:19:14.481 --> 01:19:21.380
That's odd. What did you know,
I guess I really am a bad guy.

01:19:37.290 --> 01:19:40.890
See Jack. I told you she was a bad guy.

01:19:41.599 --> 01:19:44.900
Yeah, I'm the bad guy
with the heart of Gold.

01:19:46.110 --> 01:19:50.310
Well, you might have a heart of gold,
but look at my... - Okay time to go...

01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:57.319
This way. - No, the Giant is over
there, we can get out there.

01:19:57.329 --> 01:20:00.830
But I got to get the harp,
its my quest remember.

01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:03.640
Give me a call tomorrow.
- No. Now.

01:20:05.850 --> 01:20:07.969
That way, that way.

01:20:10.879 --> 01:20:11.999
Jack...

01:20:21.109 --> 01:20:22.929
Shh...
- What?

01:20:24.239 --> 01:20:28.439
No, not you, keep playing.

01:20:30.649 --> 01:20:33.448
I'm gonna get you out of here, okay.

01:20:42.559 --> 01:20:43.959
I got an idea.

01:20:47.668 --> 01:20:51.969
What? Heroes have to eat too right?

01:20:52.679 --> 01:20:56.179
Oh, and we could do the whole silver
branch in the morning.

01:20:56.189 --> 01:20:58.288
Okay.
- Okay.

01:21:24.997 --> 01:21:26.818
Going somewhere?

01:21:30.528 --> 01:21:33.328
Duck.
- I keep telling you, I'm not a...

01:21:35.438 --> 01:21:38.237
Owh, you meant that I should have duck.

01:21:38.247 --> 01:21:41.147
Yeah, yeah. Quick we
need something to throw.

01:21:41.157 --> 01:21:43.458
You're not throwing me then?
- No not you, your eggs.

01:21:43.468 --> 01:21:47.968
I cant just produce an egg, its only
happens when I scared. - Percy... Gravy...

01:21:57.677 --> 01:22:00.298
Bee Five Four Thumb...

01:22:04.407 --> 01:22:07.907
Now it'll be a good time to
run, head to the beanstalk.

01:22:13.817 --> 01:22:15.216
Come on...

01:22:16.226 --> 01:22:17.627
...hurry Jack.

01:22:25.737 --> 01:22:27.137
Come back here.

01:22:30.246 --> 01:22:32.066
Come on, hurry...

01:22:33.977 --> 01:22:37.027
Wait, wait...
Did you tie his boots together?

01:22:37.028 --> 01:22:40.876
Well, I had help... THUMBS...

01:22:45.086 --> 01:22:46.286
Hurry...

01:22:47.596 --> 01:22:49.416
Here, give me your hand.

01:22:51.927 --> 01:22:55.326
Come back, you'll never escape.

01:23:03.136 --> 01:23:06.735
Where'd you go? Its coming.
- Keep going.

01:23:07.845 --> 01:23:09.666
Bring me back my harp.

01:23:16.476 --> 01:23:19.275
Start climbing...
- Hold on, hold on...

01:23:19.285 --> 01:23:20.685
Let's go...

01:23:21.695 --> 01:23:24.115
Jack.

01:23:25.025 --> 01:23:26.846
Hurry, hurry...

01:23:30.256 --> 01:23:32.355
You're okay Grayson?
- Yup...

01:23:33.665 --> 01:23:34.785
Hurry.

01:23:35.895 --> 01:23:39.895
I can hear him.
- Keep going.

01:23:42.206 --> 01:23:43.606
Chop... Chop...

01:23:45.215 --> 01:23:48.015
Jack, they coping the beanstalk down.

01:23:49.325 --> 01:23:55.225
Bee, five, four thumb...
I smell the blood of Englishman...

01:23:55.835 --> 01:23:59.135
Be 'ye life or be 'ye dead...

01:23:59.136 --> 01:24:03.735
I'll crush your bones
to make my bread...

01:24:04.345 --> 01:24:08.845
Oh dear, chop faster...
Chop faster... Go...

01:24:10.154 --> 01:24:12.274
Jack, hurry up.

01:24:19.085 --> 01:24:20.905
Grayson, come on.

01:24:26.314 --> 01:24:31.914
Faster... Get in, chop,chop faster...

01:24:32.024 --> 01:24:33.425
Mom.
- Jack.

01:24:33.435 --> 01:24:36.234
Mom, its me, stop cutting its Jack.

01:24:36.244 --> 01:24:39.744
Jack... - No no, you cant go up
there. It's far too dangerous.

01:24:39.754 --> 01:24:42.554
Hey mister, off with the donkey dunk.

01:25:02.363 --> 01:25:05.463
You okay? Are you alright?

01:25:08.974 --> 01:25:12.094
Mom, mom...
- Jack...

01:25:14.303 --> 01:25:17.803
You're okay, oh I was so worried.
Are you alright?

01:25:17.813 --> 01:25:19.213
I'm fine mom.

01:25:35.523 --> 01:25:36.923
Daddy.

01:25:42.133 --> 01:25:46.333
Well well... Mr. Thatcher junior.

01:25:48.843 --> 01:25:50.943
I'll expect to see you again.

01:25:51.452 --> 01:25:52.572
I know.

01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:58.483
You have anything to show me?
Before I'll give you, your final grade?

01:26:20.792 --> 01:26:22.892
Grandfather... Grandfather...

01:26:26.002 --> 01:26:30.401
Oh my Angel. You're here, your back to me.

01:26:34.112 --> 01:26:37.612
Let me look at you. Oh
you look so beautiful.

01:26:38.422 --> 01:26:44.421
I'm not surprise, I guess the apple
doesn't fall too far from the tree...

01:26:46.231 --> 01:26:47.631
Excuse me...

01:26:55.142 --> 01:26:59.141
Ah ah, you... Lancelot Squarejaw...

01:26:59.651 --> 01:27:04.851
We have a heroes challenger
four times than anyone.

01:27:05.061 --> 01:27:06.882
He still looks good.

01:27:06.892 --> 01:27:11.091
You see my life, was safe by
a true hero Daniel Thatcher.

01:27:11.101 --> 01:27:12.921
Daniel Thatc...?

01:27:13.631 --> 01:27:16.431
He's sacrifice his life for mine...

01:27:16.441 --> 01:27:19.241
but because of the injuries I sustain,

01:27:19.251 --> 01:27:23.751
it was impossible for me to save
Destiny or my own daughter.

01:27:23.761 --> 01:27:30.061
And so I turn for help to the
greatest hero I could find.

01:27:30.571 --> 01:27:31.971
His son.

01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:39.480
Its true, the apple doesn't
fall far from the tree.

01:27:46.191 --> 01:27:52.290
And the... Uh, What's that word
I'm looking for? Start with a...

01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:58.221
"P"... "P"... anyone?

01:27:59.130 --> 01:28:00.250
Prove.

01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:07.460
Maybe you should read this.

01:28:12.269 --> 01:28:14.089
Once upon a time.

01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:21.300
There was a boy named Jack.

01:28:23.210 --> 01:28:28.309
Whose initiative, perseverance, and

01:28:28.310 --> 01:28:33.410
sacrifice made him a true hero.

01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:37.919
And now, with the help of these...

01:28:37.929 --> 01:28:41.329
Oh, what do you call them?
Oh yes... Thumbs.

01:28:41.339 --> 01:28:43.859
Opposable thumbs.

01:28:47.769 --> 01:28:49.870
Ahhemm...

01:28:50.379 --> 01:28:54.579
Please, please, please...

01:29:06.489 --> 01:29:10.046
Hip hip hurray...
Hip hip hurray...

01:29:10.081 --> 01:29:12.099
Hip hip hurray...
