YOU THINK THAT THE
VIDEO PRODUCER --

27:57.719 --> 27:58.807
-VICTOR GRISWOLD!

27:58.938 --> 28:00.200
-RAN YOU OFF POINT DUNE ROAD.

28:00.330 --> 28:01.680
-MATT: YES!
-ON PURPOSE.

28:01.810 --> 28:02.855
-ABSOLUTELY!

28:02.985 --> 28:04.465
-BECAUSE?

28:04.595 --> 28:06.162
-BECAUSE HE'S TOTALLY
OBSESSED WITH JESSIE.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.512
-THEN, WHY IS HE
TRYING TO KILL YOU?

28:08.643 --> 28:09.775
-BECAUSE HE THINKS
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.

28:09.905 --> 28:10.993
-YOU AND JESSIE?

28:11.124 --> 28:12.299
-NO, ME AND HIM!

28:12.429 --> 28:13.648
MITCH, IT'S NOT
THAT COMPLICATED.

28:13.779 --> 28:15.432
THE GUY WOULDN'T
STOP HITTING ON HER,

28:15.563 --> 28:16.956
SO JESSIE THOUGHT
THAT HE'D BACK OFF

28:17.086 --> 28:18.740
IF WE PRETENDED TO BE ENGAGED.

28:19.741 --> 28:21.177
-BUT HE TRIED TO
KILL YOU INSTEAD?

28:21.308 --> 28:22.613
-YES, THE GUY'S CRAZY!

28:22.744 --> 28:24.267
-DID YOU SEE HIM?

28:24.398 --> 28:25.704
I MEAN, DID YOU ACTUALLY
SEE HIM ON THE MOTORCYCLE?

28:25.834 --> 28:26.966
-NO, ALL I SAW WAS
HIS BLACK HELMET.

28:27.096 --> 28:28.315
-CAN YOU IDENTIFY
THE MOTORCYCLE?

28:28.445 --> 28:30.056
-NO, IT WAS TOO FAST.

28:30.186 --> 28:31.318
ALL I SAW WAS A BLUR.

28:31.448 --> 28:32.580
-SO IT COULD HAVE BEEN VICTOR

28:32.711 --> 28:34.234
OR SOME DRUNK WHO LOST CONTROL

28:34.364 --> 28:35.801
AND WAS JUST TOO SCARED TO STOP.

28:35.931 --> 28:37.977
-MITCH, I KNOW IT WAS HIM.

28:38.107 --> 28:39.413
-BUT YOU CAN'T PROVE IT.

28:40.370 --> 28:42.677
LOOK, IF THIS GUY REALLY
IS STALKING JESSIE,

28:42.808 --> 28:45.506
THE BEST WAY TO GET HIM IS
FOR JESSIE TO PRESS CHARGES.

28:45.636 --> 28:47.290
-SHE WON'T.

28:47.421 --> 28:49.292
-AND IT'S YOUR JOB TO MAKE
SURE SHE CHANGES HER MIND.

28:49.423 --> 28:51.077
TAKE CARE OF THAT.

28:51.773 --> 28:52.643
-THANKS.

28:58.040 --> 28:59.694
-I WONDER WHERE EVERYONE IS.

28:59.825 --> 29:01.130
-WELL, ARE YOU EARLY?

29:01.261 --> 29:02.697
-I DON'T THINK SO.

29:06.745 --> 29:09.051
ANYWAY, SUMMER,
THANKS FOR THE RIDE.

29:09.182 --> 29:11.880
MATT'S VERY LUCKY TO HAVE
SOMEBODY SO UNDERSTANDING.

29:12.011 --> 29:13.882
-WELL, YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU TOLD
ME ABOUT THIS VICTOR GUY,

29:14.013 --> 29:15.188
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST HANG OUT

29:15.318 --> 29:16.276
'TIL YOU'RE SURE
EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

29:18.147 --> 29:19.932
-THERE'S OUR
MARINE COORDINATOR.

29:28.854 --> 29:32.466
HI, RANSOM. WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

29:33.119 --> 29:35.295
-NO ONE TOLD YOU? THE SHOOT
WAS CANCELLED FOR TODAY.

29:35.425 --> 29:39.168
-OH, WELL, I WASN'T AT A NUMBER
WHERE I COULD BE REACHED.

-ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T NEED
A RIDE BACK TO THE HOTEL?

29:46.262 --> 29:47.437
-OH, NO, I JUST
NEED TO GATHER UP

29:47.568 --> 29:49.222
SOME THINGS IN THE TRAILER,

29:49.352 --> 29:50.223
THEN I'M GONNA GO LAY ON THE
BEACH AND VEG FOR A WHILE.

29:50.353 --> 29:51.833
-OKAY.

29:51.964 --> 29:55.010
-HEY, SUMMER, GIVE MATT
A KISS GOOD-BYE FOR ME.

29:55.141 --> 29:58.187
-OKAY, I GUESS IT'S
BETTER ME THAN YOU, HUH?

-YOU SPENT THE NIGHT WITH
HIM LAST NIGHT, DIDN'T YOU?

30:44.625 --> 30:46.627
-WHERE I SPEND THE NIGHT
IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE

30:51.240 --> 30:52.938
AND THEN JUST HAVE THEM
TAKEN FROM YOU, ALL RIGHT?

30:54.243 --> 30:55.288
-GET OUT, VICTOR.

30:55.418 --> 30:56.942

BECAUSE NOW HE'S
ABOUT AS FLAT AS ONE.

31:01.337 --> 31:02.861
-WHAT DID YOU DO, VICTOR?

31:04.775 --> 31:07.648
-AS THEY SAY,
TO THE VICTOR GO THE SPOILS.

31:07.778 --> 31:09.780
GIVE ME A LITTLE KISS, JESSIE.
-NO! VICTOR, NO!

31:09.911 --> 31:11.565

TO BE MY FIANCE

31:25.274 --> 31:27.276

-WELL SHE'S, YOU KNOW,
SHE'S CUTE.

31:33.587 --> 31:35.502
MAYBE, MAYBE I
SHOULD BE WITH HER,

31:35.632 --> 31:36.895
AND THEN YOU CAN SEE
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE--

31:37.025 --> 31:38.461

WOULD YOU MIND TERRIBLY
IF I DID IT MYSELF?
