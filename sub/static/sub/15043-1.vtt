ARTHUR 3
WAR OF TWO WORLDS
Subtitles: Maver.ikk

00:50.758 --> 00:52.550
"Remember ..."

00:52.633 --> 00:57.342
"Arthur was a little boy who wanted to
save his grandparents' home."

00:57.425 --> 01:01.508
"He asked the two-millimetre tall Minimoys,
who lived at the bottom of his garden,..."

01:01.592 --> 01:05.758
"...to help him find the mysterious
treasure held by the diabolical Maltazard..."

01:05.883 --> 01:08.050
"...and his son Darcos."

01:08.217 --> 01:11.758
-Hey, hero, let's go!
"Princess Selenia and her little brother Betameche..."

01:11.883 --> 01:14.550
"...joined our
dauntless adventure."

01:14.675 --> 01:19.717
"After many brave exploits and close shaves,
they thwarted Maltazard's plan."

01:19.800 --> 01:23.842
-Father, get me!
"And at last, they recovered the treasure."

01:25.925 --> 01:31.550
-Bravo, my boy.
"Ten Months later, Arthur received a S.O.S"

01:31.633 --> 01:34.967
"He made it back to the Minimoys
as fast as he could."

01:40.133 --> 01:43.133
"With his friend Max and
his flying ladybug..."

01:43.258 --> 01:45.675
"Arthur went to the rescue."

01:46.258 --> 01:49.508
"After freeing Betameche
from the army of Unicorns..."

01:50.341 --> 01:53.591
"...he finally reached
the Minimoy village."

01:54.425 --> 02:00.300
"Only to discover that the call for help, was a trap
set for him by the loathsome, Malthazard."

02:00.508 --> 02:05.300
"Maltazard was determined to take Arthur's place
on the return trip out of the Minimoy's world..."

02:10.300 --> 02:13.675
"...into the human world."

02:14.716 --> 02:21.758
"Now in, bigger and stronger than ever.
How can Arthur, Betameche and Selenia stop him?!"

02:23.550 --> 02:26.591
"At last, you're going to find out."

03:19.341 --> 03:24.800
The Liberators
TODAY

03:46.925 --> 03:49.133
They're so excitable today.

03:49.258 --> 03:53.216
Strange, Spring's long gone.
Hey, what's going on?!

03:53.341 --> 03:56.508
What? That's awful!

03:59.633 --> 04:04.466
Hey, Beautiful, we'll finish this off later!
I have to warn the king!

04:13.675 --> 04:15.591
Come on, taxi!

04:59.633 --> 05:03.800
Did you just knock? -Yes, with my head!
-Geez, why can't you use your hand, like everybody else?

05:03.883 --> 05:07.133
There's no time to explain,
I need to see the King!

05:16.174 --> 05:21.508
Arthur, this can't be a good omen.
Do something to help, will you?.
- I'll try.

05:26.216 --> 05:29.299
Still going, hah?
- Yes.

05:32.424 --> 05:34.508
Hi.
-Hi.

05:34.591 --> 05:39.008
Don't you think you should try to come up with a plan first
before charging off to a new adventure?

05:39.091 --> 05:42.716
We have to catch Evil M's
before he can do any harm. That's the plan!

05:42.799 --> 05:47.049
Evil M is probably seven foot tall by now!
We are two millimeters tall.

05:47.174 --> 05:49.758
Seven feet, two millimeters...
What is the difference?

05:49.841 --> 05:52.591
You don't measure soldiers' bravery
in inches.

05:52.716 --> 05:55.383
You are right, it's measured by the number of people
who turn up at his funeral.

05:55.508 --> 05:59.674
Selenia, you have no idea what seven foot is.
The power of this sword will be useless.

05:59.841 --> 06:03.466
He'll use it to pick his teeth!
-Maybe he will. Maybe I fail,..

06:03.549 --> 06:07.258
...but I'm a princess of royal blood
and I will defend
my kingdom 'till my last breath!

06:08.966 --> 06:12.716
Awesome! Great speeches!
Meantime, the sword is a still in the stone.

06:12.966 --> 06:17.508
Beta, tell me ... -Yes?
It's been a long time since I beat you up,
hasn't it?

06:18.383 --> 06:21.091
No.

06:21.924 --> 06:23.508
Cut it out!

06:23.591 --> 06:27.799
The best plan is definitely not to beat
each other up! - So, what's the best plan,
Mr. Smarty pants!

06:27.883 --> 06:30.966
We have to take a minute and think.
Calmly, ok.

06:31.049 --> 06:35.591
M is very tall and we are very small,
but he's a stranger in a world
that I know very well.

06:35.674 --> 06:39.133
And he will not take long to
raise an army and invade my country.

06:39.258 --> 06:43.466
Now he's so big he can travel faster and farther.
-Now I think that leaves us with only one option!

06:43.549 --> 06:47.716
We have to grow too!
-Bravo, Arthur, the perfect solution!

06:47.841 --> 06:50.966
Maybe you can tell us how you plan
on growing us?

06:51.049 --> 06:53.841
Maybe gobble down a ton selenijske soup
to make a quick gain of...

06:53.966 --> 06:57.258
...one millimeter!
No, but there has to be a solution.

06:57.383 --> 06:59.758
He's right! Is written
in the big book. Page 712...

06:59.841 --> 07:03.341
...where there is no solution, there's no problem.
-Well, little brother, guess what?

07:03.424 --> 07:06.258
There is a problem, and the solution
cannot be found in any book.

07:06.341 --> 07:08.883
In a book! Of course! You're so right!

07:09.008 --> 07:12.466
The solution is not in a book?
It's between two books!
-What?

07:12.549 --> 07:16.299
Listen to me! In Archibald's study,
I saw a vial between two books.

07:16.383 --> 07:20.341
It contained an elixir that makes you go
from Minimoy size to human size!

07:20.466 --> 07:25.591
So, we are not human enough for you!
-No, that's not what I ... Selenia, please!

07:25.674 --> 07:29.466
This is not a time to pick fights!
Adventure is waiting for us!

07:31.591 --> 07:35.549
By the Great Forest! I'll never
get used to that.

08:04.966 --> 08:07.924
Simon, your badge!

08:08.008 --> 08:12.633
Your badge should be 4 fingers
over your left pocket, and no place else.

08:12.758 --> 08:16.258
Sorry, Chief.
Thanks for the tip.

08:26.508 --> 08:31.383
Martin, that was fast.
-"You holler, we are here." That's our motto.
-Yes I know.

08:31.466 --> 08:36.841
And who's that? -He...is my new partner.
Just out of school.

08:37.424 --> 08:41.924
I try to teach him the rudiments of the job.
You know, the 'do's' and 'don't's', the 'in's' and 'out's', the 'how's' and...

08:42.008 --> 08:48.507
... and 'how not to's'!
-Just one month and he's already crawling.
He's a promising recruit.

08:51.632 --> 08:54.091
Simon!

08:54.424 --> 08:58.757
Chief, I lost my badge!
-Find it!!

09:03.841 --> 09:09.674
You know it's my son-in-law that insisted
on calling you. I wouldn't disturb you
for anything so minor.

09:09.841 --> 09:14.216
Hello, Martin. -Mrs. Rose, my pleasure.
-You must be dying of thirst from this heat...

09:14.299 --> 09:18.882
I'll make you some nice, fresh lemonade.
-That will be great, thank you.

09:18.966 --> 09:22.966
What exactly happened?
-Oh, it was nothing, a little too much sun on his head.

09:23.091 --> 09:26.424
When the temperature rises,
the heat makes you see things.

09:26.507 --> 09:28.674
Well, let me talk to him.

09:33.841 --> 09:39.132
Well, then, sir. What...
exactly did we see today?

09:39.341 --> 09:44.382
I saw the devil!
-The devil?

09:48.091 --> 09:50.799
What did this devil look like?

09:50.841 --> 09:57.174
Er... about ten feet tall, with a big hat
and... wings on his back.

09:57.299 --> 10:02.632
Interesting. Skin color? White, black, yellow?
-Green.

10:03.174 --> 10:07.132
With blue tints.
-Any distinguishing features?

10:07.174 --> 10:10.174
Big nose without nostrils.

10:10.424 --> 10:15.257
And holes all over the rest of his body. One
tiny arm, kind of withered,

10:15.382 --> 10:20.216
..compared with the other, which was enormous
with this kind of pincers...

10:20.341 --> 10:25.632
...he used to pick me up and threw me down!
I was so scared I called for my mother!

10:25.716 --> 10:27.757
Armand?

10:27.799 --> 10:31.132
Hello, Martin.
-Ma'am? -Oh, one more thing!

10:31.257 --> 10:33.716
I think he likes marshmallows.

10:33.799 --> 10:36.716
I think I have all I need.
-Ok.

10:36.799 --> 10:40.466
I'm going to write up my report,
and we will be in touch.

10:45.716 --> 10:47.757
Simon!

10:47.799 --> 10:51.216
Archibald, I don't want to alarm you...

10:51.299 --> 10:54.966
...but, the situation might be worse than you think
-Don't worry about it.

10:55.091 --> 10:58.549
I know him ever since he was this high.
I know how to talk with him.

10:58.674 --> 11:02.716
Talking is fine, but in this situation, you may
consider isolating him.

11:02.799 --> 11:06.757
Definitely! Before we can isolate him,
we have to capture him.

11:06.841 --> 11:10.591
We will break the spell and he'll shrink
back to its 3mm height.

11:10.674 --> 11:13.882
All it will soon will be back to
normal. Thank you for stopping by.

11:15.966 --> 11:17.716
Chief ...

11:17.799 --> 11:20.924
...I still can't find my badge.

11:21.632 --> 11:25.424
First thing first,
let's get out of this mad house!

11:39.549 --> 11:44.132
This is so typical of humans!
Just throwing things away without a word of warning!

11:44.216 --> 11:49.216
What is this thing? - It's a Police badge. My parents must have
called the police when they saw I disappeared.

11:49.299 --> 11:52.924
When I disappear
invite my people over to celebrate!

11:53.132 --> 11:56.632
Are you sure that this is the best
way to enter my world?

11:56.757 --> 12:01.674
Watch out! -Yuck, looks like a sward.
-Maybe mud. -Not quite!

12:05.132 --> 12:10.299
Where do they come from? -Three days of rain,
it went up with a mud face
of every bug within a ten-mile radius.

12:10.424 --> 12:13.132
Looking at a million of anything!
-Or anybody.

12:13.257 --> 12:17.090
Look, I think Selenia is right about us as a team.
We'll just end up getting in each other's way?

12:17.132 --> 12:19.799
Hey, I will let you two go ahead.
Good idea, huh?

12:19.882 --> 12:22.174
I have a better one.

12:24.424 --> 12:27.924
Hop on. We'll slide right over them.

12:29.132 --> 12:32.049
All aboard the Bug-Express!

12:36.049 --> 12:40.590
How do you steer this thing? -You don't!
You just lean to one side or the other.

12:40.674 --> 12:43.007
Sure, but which side? -Right?

12:46.090 --> 12:47.799
Left!

12:51.299 --> 12:55.090
What about braking?
-You just wait for the slugs to flatten out .

13:02.840 --> 13:05.257
Ohhh! They are huge this year!

13:05.340 --> 13:10.007
You gotta wonder whether that new factory
is spewing out some wierd stuff!

13:13.424 --> 13:17.590
Hey Chief, in the heat the road
looks like it's warped.

13:17.674 --> 13:20.132
It's like in the desert, a mirage.

13:20.257 --> 13:23.924
Pretty soon, you'll be seeing palm trees.

13:29.299 --> 13:34.757
You're right, I do see a palm tree right there
in the middle of the road! -It's an optical illusion.

13:34.840 --> 13:39.257
It's really that water tower
about a mile down there.

13:40.132 --> 13:43.590
Well, it's a heck of an illusion,
it looks like it's moving.

13:43.674 --> 13:47.507
Just wait a couple of seconds
and your palm tree will completely disappear.

13:49.424 --> 13:56.299
Chief, that's not a plam tree!
-The devil!

14:02.215 --> 14:04.924
You know him?

14:20.674 --> 14:24.590
Evil M has vanished.
-What do you mean 'vanished'?

14:25.049 --> 14:28.257
We searched every inch of the forest.
There's no trace of him.

14:28.340 --> 14:31.965
Couldn't have flown away.
His wings haven't been working for ages.

14:32.049 --> 14:36.424
He will come back. We'll hide
and wait for him. -Hide?

14:36.507 --> 14:40.965
All 8 feet of him? You don't really think
that nobody is going to noti ...

14:50.674 --> 14:55.965
What pipe is right one? -This one is from my room
which is right next to Archibald's study.

14:56.049 --> 14:58.215
Perfect.

14:58.340 --> 15:02.132
We have to climb all the way up.
-Don't worry, we gonna take a bubble?

15:07.049 --> 15:09.049
We would like to take a trip.

15:09.132 --> 15:12.299
Did anybody ever teach you to say 'hello'
when you wake someone up?

15:12.382 --> 15:15.632
'Hello', we would like to take a trip.
-I know it's for a trip!

15:15.715 --> 15:20.715
What other reasons would anyone wake me up?
For my' pleasant' mood and my 'sparkling' conversation?!

15:22.132 --> 15:24.924
Right! At least know where
you're going.

15:25.049 --> 15:29.007
Ya! that pipe there with the red lever.
-Perfect!

15:32.340 --> 15:36.007
Alright! Stay seated, avoid sharp objects
and loud noises.

15:36.090 --> 15:38.965
Got it?! -Ok.
-Flight time is about 5 minutes.

15:39.090 --> 15:41.715
Thank you for using our company
and we hope to see you again...

15:41.799 --> 15:45.007
...in a million years.
-Not exactly great sales strategy.

15:45.132 --> 15:48.882
Listen here! If I chose this backwater outpost,
it wasn't to do business...

15:49.007 --> 15:52.465
...it was to be left alone, not to be
woken up every 5 minutes ...

15:52.590 --> 15:56.048
Somebody made a trip before us?
-Yes, only a few days ago.

15:56.173 --> 15:59.423
Some poor slober was weeping like a willow.
-What did he look like?

15:59.548 --> 16:03.715
Eh... pretty big guy, nasty
arms, nice eyes, but a real blockhead...

16:03.798 --> 16:06.548
Darcos!
-That's the one!

16:08.632 --> 16:13.673
No, please! Open up!
-Have a nice trip!
-Open up! We want to get out!

16:22.132 --> 16:26.923
Well, here we go. You talk about bad luck
and it comes running
-Beta, don't be so superstitious.

16:27.007 --> 16:29.548
Do you think we're going stay
like this for a long time?

16:29.673 --> 16:34.215
Yeah, until someone in this dump
gets the great idea to turn on the water.

16:39.757 --> 16:43.632
Douglas, see who's on the list
today. I need 4 volunteers!

16:49.257 --> 16:53.548
What happened?
-We saw ...a mirage.

16:53.715 --> 16:59.173
And palm trees. -So what?
-Well, it wasn't a mirage.

17:00.007 --> 17:03.257
It wasn't a palm tree.
-What was it then?

17:04.298 --> 17:07.382
It was the devil.
-What?

17:10.589 --> 17:14.339
On top of that, I lost my badge.

17:32.632 --> 17:36.298
Good morning, Mrs.. Springler.
-Good morning, Mrs.. Herman.

17:36.382 --> 17:38.173
How are you doing today?
-Very well indeed.

17:38.298 --> 17:42.715
Now what can I do for you today?
-I need a new tablecloth.
-Oh, please come in!

17:43.132 --> 17:45.340
Let me show you what we've got.

17:45.423 --> 17:50.923
Looking cloth or linen?
Oh, I have got just the thing!

17:51.965 --> 17:55.298
Look, this just came in from France?
-Really?

17:55.382 --> 17:57.632
Yes, Isn't it beautiful?

18:00.923 --> 18:03.965
Good day, Mrs. Springler.

18:38.132 --> 18:39.965
DR Stich
SURGEON

18:43.923 --> 18:47.757
If it's a client I will give them
a 50% discount.

18:53.257 --> 18:58.423
I am sorry, I was expecting
someone else.

19:01.548 --> 19:05.590
How... how can I help you?
I saw your ad.

19:10.298 --> 19:12.465
Nice work.

19:12.965 --> 19:15.006
Oh, thanks you... er.

19:18.673 --> 19:24.131
How can I help you?
-I want my old face back again.

19:24.215 --> 19:27.090
What did you look like before?

19:27.215 --> 19:32.423
I was young, good looking,
a proud and wilful warrior.

19:32.881 --> 19:36.631
Determined to conquer
both lands and hearts.

19:36.756 --> 19:41.173
Now, look at me! I am nothing
but a ghost of my former self.

19:41.298 --> 19:44.173
I have to say you're not exactly...

19:45.381 --> 19:48.048
...easy on the eyes!

19:48.590 --> 19:51.840
Eh, but how did it happen?
-Poisoning.

19:51.965 --> 19:56.381
I have seen some horrible cases in my day,
but nothing compared to this.

19:56.923 --> 20:02.465
I mean in terms of decomposition.
-Who poisoned you? -A woman!

20:03.881 --> 20:06.673
Oh... women can be terrifyingly
merciless sometimes.

20:06.798 --> 20:10.465
Yes, evil especially?

20:10.673 --> 20:13.881
Look, the best thing for you to do
is go home.

20:14.006 --> 20:16.881
Take a few magazines, cut out everything
you like, nose, mouth, ears ...

20:16.965 --> 20:20.881
Then, come back with your clippings
and I'll see what I can do, okay?

20:24.006 --> 20:26.881
I know exactly what I want.

20:27.215 --> 20:31.215
I will cancel all my appontments
and see you right now! Just show me what
you want and I'll do it!

20:31.298 --> 20:35.673
I don't want to be called evil M anymore!

20:36.965 --> 20:41.548
I want to be called M,
'The Magician'!

20:41.631 --> 20:43.548
OK.

20:44.965 --> 20:50.798
Doesn't anyone in your family ever wash?
-Of course, usually the first
into the bathroom is my father.

20:50.923 --> 20:52.715
For a quick shave.

20:52.798 --> 20:56.715
After that, when we're at home,
my mother generally takes a bath.

20:56.798 --> 21:00.298
As for grandma,
she likes to water the flowers!

21:00.840 --> 21:04.090
Why is the faucet always
so hard to turn?

21:04.215 --> 21:07.006
And if mother doesn't really assist us...
grandma will.

21:07.131 --> 21:11.048
Because by this time she is usually in the kitchen
peeling and washing vegetables for lunch.

21:11.131 --> 21:14.298
Hello, Mrs. Springler,
I'm so sorry to bother you.

21:14.340 --> 21:19.006
I was wondering if by any chance that
you see my Arthur somewhere in your fields.

21:19.131 --> 21:23.423
And if grandma doesn't get us out of here,
grandpa certainly will.

21:24.756 --> 21:28.923
So, what you're saying is...
we should get moving ages ago?
-In theory...

21:29.006 --> 21:34.090
Yes! -I knew it... fate! We've just pissed
the Goddess of the forest, now she's getting even.

21:34.173 --> 21:36.965
Stop complaining, Betameche,
could be worse.

21:37.048 --> 21:41.631
Oh, There is worse than being trapped in
bubble in a rotten pipe full of water?

21:41.715 --> 21:44.340
What?

21:49.715 --> 21:53.381
With a bit of luck, the current
will keep him away.

21:59.298 --> 22:00.715
Hi!

22:01.923 --> 22:05.423
This time you won't escape me!

22:06.465 --> 22:09.590
Selenia, what do we do?
-Absolutely nothing.

22:09.673 --> 22:14.173
Look, he's spinning his bubble around
the water. Gradually, he'll drift away.

22:14.881 --> 22:17.506
Ya, ya!
-Let's cheer him on!

22:17.631 --> 22:22.256
Go, go Darcos! -Come on,
Darcos! Just go!

22:22.381 --> 22:27.840
Run faster! Run!
Good boy, Darcos.

22:28.965 --> 22:31.465
Try to do better next time!

22:40.881 --> 22:44.964
Is he allowed to do that?
Selenia, what do we do?

22:45.506 --> 22:49.006
We pray that someone in this
house needs water!

22:55.589 --> 22:59.464
If praying doesn't work,
then what shall we do?

22:59.548 --> 23:04.548
Then we wait for bells to begin
for the final battle!

23:21.464 --> 23:23.006
Hi!

23:23.964 --> 23:25.714
Damn!

23:28.714 --> 23:30.464
Yes?

23:32.089 --> 23:34.089
Sir?

23:35.423 --> 23:39.631
Can I help you?
-Yes, indeed.

23:39.964 --> 23:44.423
I'm terribly sorry to trouble you
so early in the morning.
- That's not a problem.

23:44.506 --> 23:50.339
Are you lost? -Well, yes in a way.
Actually, this is my land a long time ago.

23:50.464 --> 23:55.631
So long ago, in fact, I hardly recognize it.
-I see, you lived here as a boy...

23:55.714 --> 23:59.131
...you've come back for old time sake?
-Exactly!

23:59.256 --> 24:02.631
These vast pastures with
the playground reminds you...

24:02.714 --> 24:06.881
It must have seemed less vast,
now that you've grown so tall? -Yes, indeed.

24:07.048 --> 24:09.339
Much smaller.

24:09.423 --> 24:13.339
Come in, please. It's already hot outside,
you'll feel much better in the shade.

24:13.423 --> 24:18.339
Yes, I do prefer shady places.

24:25.131 --> 24:27.714
Come in, please.

24:35.756 --> 24:38.214
Please take a sit.

24:38.381 --> 24:42.423
I will bring you a glass of chilled lemonade.
-Don't go to any trouble on my account.

24:42.548 --> 24:46.631
A glass of water will be fine.
-Lemonade is a family tradition.

24:46.756 --> 24:51.173
Our grandson loves it.
-Your Grandson? Oh, I adore children.

24:51.548 --> 24:53.673
Where is he?

24:55.673 --> 24:58.173
He's eh.. he's in his room.

25:07.589 --> 25:10.089
Give me your hand.

25:18.423 --> 25:23.839
This is your bedroom? No, this is just
the bathroom where I get washed every morning.

25:24.256 --> 25:27.631
I'd rather stay dirty.
-You generally do anyway, Beta.

25:27.673 --> 25:30.881
Every morning is a battle to get you
under the droplet.
-That's not true!

25:30.964 --> 25:33.589
I'm not afraid of a drop of water!

25:34.589 --> 25:38.256
Hey, Arthur! Are we going to walk for long?
-No.

25:39.214 --> 25:44.798
Oh, my gosh, these cars! Look at this one!
-No. -This is one is great! -No!

25:45.089 --> 25:51.131
I love this one! -No!
-What about this one, huh?
-No, I have got about a dozen of that.

25:51.214 --> 25:55.798
But this one is my favorite.
-What so special about it?

25:56.881 --> 25:59.589
It goes fast!

26:00.339 --> 26:03.548
Hey, you know where you're going?
-Yes.

26:24.506 --> 26:28.589
Now we left the bathroom.
To your left, my desk, to your right, the bed

26:28.672 --> 26:31.131
...and straight ahead, Grand Central Station.

26:33.214 --> 26:36.297
Last stop, everybody out!

26:48.297 --> 26:51.797
Got any more surprises like that
up your sleeve?

26:53.172 --> 26:59.214
Actually, there's one more.
-Better tell me about it now. I hate surprises!

26:59.297 --> 27:04.047
Right, ok. I have a friend called Alfred.
He's a dog.

27:04.131 --> 27:10.756
What is a dog? -It's like a gamos,
but much, much bigger.

27:16.131 --> 27:19.839
Do not worry, he wouldn't
hurt a fly.

27:24.256 --> 27:27.339
Go on Alfred! Scram!
Leave her alone! Move!

27:42.881 --> 27:46.297
Arthur, you're not going to kill the
poor animal, are you? -No, silly.

27:46.381 --> 27:49.214
Just give him something to chase!

28:10.756 --> 28:15.297
Sir, won't be a minute.
The Ice cubes won't come out of the tray.

28:15.381 --> 28:17.964
Hmmm... funny! -Indeed.

28:19.964 --> 28:25.006
Why did you invite that stranger into the house?
-I don't know. The 'voice' probably.

28:25.089 --> 28:29.922
Seem to recognize it, but his face...
- Not a face you can easily forget.

28:30.047 --> 28:34.672
I must be losing my memory with age.
I just can't put a face to that voice.

28:37.714 --> 28:42.172
Dad, Why doesn't the faucet open
when I'm using it? -Because you're turning it
the wrong way, honey? Remember...

28:42.297 --> 28:44.922
Righty-tighty, lefty-loosey.

28:45.006 --> 28:47.964
Put your hands around this pitcher.
-Oh... much better!

28:48.047 --> 28:52.714
Rose, we have a guest in the living room.
Will do me a favor and bring in
the lemonade. I'll get the glass.

28:52.839 --> 28:58.547
Honey, our guest looks a little strange.
Try not to stare.

28:58.631 --> 29:04.172
Oh, you can count on me, Dad. Remember
every Saturday I work as volunteer at the hospital.

29:04.672 --> 29:07.214
That's good.

29:10.047 --> 29:13.672
A nice refreshing lemonade?

29:19.881 --> 29:23.131
Rose? -What was that
horrible scream?

29:23.214 --> 29:26.672
Oh, nothing, it's just my mother.
-Rose!

29:34.297 --> 29:39.922
Honey, honey, it's me!
I'm here! Say something!

29:42.214 --> 29:44.589
I will get a cold cloth.

29:44.672 --> 29:48.047
Is it serious, doctor?
I think she will survive.

29:48.130 --> 29:51.255
Darling, darling,
wake up, we love you!

29:51.339 --> 29:54.339
Come back to us, come back to us!

29:57.505 --> 30:00.755
If the princess would kindly step aboard.

30:00.839 --> 30:02.672
Whatever.

30:10.797 --> 30:14.797
Stand clear off the track,
the train is about to depart.

31:08.672 --> 31:12.547
I love the train? -Isn't it
a great way to travel?
-It's a little bit old-fashion.

31:12.672 --> 31:16.130
but at least we have the time
to admire the view.

31:17.297 --> 31:19.339
Ku-ku.

31:19.422 --> 31:20.839
Arthur!

31:35.464 --> 31:38.005
Ku-ku, again!

31:40.422 --> 31:42.797
Now that hurts!
-Let's get out of here?

31:49.505 --> 31:53.422
Let me deal with this.
-Yes, let's make a deal!

31:56.422 --> 31:58.297
Arthur!

32:06.422 --> 32:08.005
Arthur?

32:09.255 --> 32:11.672
Help me! -Careful! move to your right!

32:22.130 --> 32:25.172
Hasta la vista, baby!

32:34.630 --> 32:38.880
Hey, Darcose, let's make peace.
-Sure!

32:39.005 --> 32:40.839
No, Arthur!

32:41.839 --> 32:43.964
Be careful!

32:44.922 --> 32:47.130
Arthur, watch out!

32:50.047 --> 32:53.505
Beta, do something!
Arthur!

33:00.464 --> 33:03.505
Well done! Arthur, come on!

33:07.339 --> 33:09.422
Don't move, stay here.

33:13.713 --> 33:16.755
Selenia!
-Arthur!

33:20.797 --> 33:25.255
Artur, we do not have the time for this.
-Yes! I mean no!

33:39.380 --> 33:42.172
Let me deal with this!

33:46.297 --> 33:48.005
Arthur!

33:50.213 --> 33:52.838
Be careful!

33:55.255 --> 34:00.172
"Twinkle, twinkle little fish,
I will have you in my..." -Stop!

34:02.255 --> 34:06.713
Selenia! -Arthur!
-... I'll eat you whole! -No!

34:15.130 --> 34:18.130
Guys, we really don't have time for this.

34:22.880 --> 34:25.672
Let's split up!

34:59.422 --> 35:03.172
Darcos, you should turn around.
-Ya, ya, I know that trick!

35:03.255 --> 35:06.838
Darcos there's a tunnel!
-Really? -Trust me.

35:33.213 --> 35:37.505
Another piece! You have to be careful
of glass. They're everywhere.

35:37.797 --> 35:39.963
I made you some coffee.

35:40.088 --> 35:44.422
Lemonade would have been more refreshing,
but ... That's all we've got.

35:44.505 --> 35:48.338
I'll put it over here, on the mantle.
-You are most kind.

35:52.922 --> 35:58.547
May I use the bathroom? -Yes, of course.
It's just past the stairs on the right.

35:58.588 --> 36:00.505
Thank you.

36:06.713 --> 36:10.172
Are you OK? -I am fine, I'm fine!!
-Nothing is broken?

36:10.255 --> 36:13.797
There's nothing left to break!
-Wait, don't move.

36:13.880 --> 36:16.713
There's a shard of glass in your skin.

36:21.172 --> 36:25.713
This must be getting in your way.
Let me remove it.

36:26.755 --> 36:29.213
Enough!

36:36.922 --> 36:38.630
The devil!

36:52.505 --> 36:56.171
Maltazard.
-At your service!

36:56.255 --> 36:59.296
I know that I have heard that voice
somewhere before!

36:59.421 --> 37:02.421
Am I a master of disguise, or what?

37:04.130 --> 37:07.921
You have me fooled. Compared
to others I've seen ...

37:08.046 --> 37:12.088
Amateur! Grab him!

37:55.713 --> 37:59.130
Ah... now where were we?

37:59.255 --> 38:03.880
You're destroying everything in your
path, as usual! -Eh, that's right.

38:04.130 --> 38:09.421
That little "dust-up" has created a certain amount of chaos.
Please forgive me, Daisy.

38:09.755 --> 38:12.171
How did you know my name?

38:12.255 --> 38:15.171
In another life I had
the privilege of watching you cook?

38:15.213 --> 38:19.380
I must admit, I was very impressed. I can't
judge the quality of the meals you'd prepared...

38:19.463 --> 38:24.213
...because my tongue is
completely insensitive.

38:29.546 --> 38:33.921
But the determination and dedication
you'd employed on certain dishes...

38:34.005 --> 38:38.380
...was a source of wonder to me.
That famous chocolate pie come to mind...

38:38.463 --> 38:43.171
...you started over a hundred times until
you wished yours were perfect.

38:43.255 --> 38:47.838
You have been spying on me?
-No, I was just a simple admirer.

38:47.921 --> 38:51.421
Observing you from my
three-millimetre high vantage point.

38:51.505 --> 38:54.046
But things have changed.

38:54.130 --> 38:56.713
I've grown!

39:02.421 --> 39:04.921
Alright, Beta,you stay here
and cover us.

39:05.046 --> 39:07.630
If anything happens, whistle, ok!
-No problemo!

39:07.713 --> 39:11.046
Oh, you know how to whistle now?
-Of course!

39:12.046 --> 39:14.671
Just one whistle will do.

39:14.796 --> 39:17.046
"You know how to whistle now?"

39:19.088 --> 39:21.130
Follow me.

39:30.546 --> 39:34.588
Arth ... ur!
Se ... Lenia! Phoo... phooo...

39:42.338 --> 39:46.755
Come on, Selenia!
-I'm coming, I'm coming!

39:52.880 --> 39:56.130
No, too big!

39:57.005 --> 40:00.255
No, too loud!
Too complicated!

40:00.463 --> 40:02.171
Perfect!

40:12.046 --> 40:13.838
Hi!

40:16.671 --> 40:18.963
This way!

40:23.838 --> 40:28.754
Thank God, it's still here.
We are safe!

40:36.754 --> 40:41.129
Ah, so this is your den.
Your palace. -My God!

40:41.213 --> 40:45.171
It's just like you. Old and dusty
and full of things that have no use.

40:45.254 --> 40:48.046
Daddy, Daddy, it's me!
-On the contrary!...

40:48.088 --> 40:52.379
All these objects are very useful,
my dear Maltazard. -Oh, yeah? -Yes!

40:52.463 --> 40:56.754
The book, for example, is very useful
for feeding your souls.

40:57.421 --> 40:59.504
If you have one.

40:59.588 --> 41:04.004
Daddy, that's me, Daddy!
-Archibald...

41:04.129 --> 41:08.254
..can you hear some kind of noise?
Like a tiny voice.

41:09.713 --> 41:12.254
No.

41:12.838 --> 41:17.171
Hurry, Arthur, they're coming!
-I'm doing the best I can, Selenia!

41:18.046 --> 41:20.129
Oh, no!

41:26.546 --> 41:30.088
After this you came, right?
-Yeah!

41:30.546 --> 41:33.921
Promise you will? Now
leave this house.

41:34.004 --> 41:37.129
How can I be sure you're not playing
a trick on me?

41:37.213 --> 41:40.629
Have I ever gone back on my word?
-No, you haven't.

41:40.713 --> 41:43.879
So, try keeping yours for once.

41:56.629 --> 41:59.421
Oh no, it's a catastrophe!

41:59.504 --> 42:03.129
You scared me? -Would you have
preferred me to whistle to warn you?
-Very funny.

42:03.213 --> 42:06.004
It's not my fault. With emotion,
I couldn't whistle anymore.

42:06.088 --> 42:09.629
Of course you wouldn't know anything
about emotions. -Thoughts? You think you little boys
have monopoly of emotions?

42:09.713 --> 42:13.254
No, it's for anybody who has a heart!  -If I didn't
have a heart, I would have drowned long ago!

42:13.338 --> 42:16.421
And I would have been bigger,
I would have shut your mouth long time ago!

42:16.504 --> 42:20.879
And if Maltazard drink of the content from the vial,
he'll crush us all. Don't you get it?

42:22.463 --> 42:27.421
It's Darcos. We have to get him out of there.
-So that he can massacre us even sooner? -No!

42:27.546 --> 42:31.213
So that he can help us find his father.
Come on, help me.

42:34.129 --> 42:36.754
It's too heavy.
What the heck is it?

42:36.838 --> 42:39.921
Tolstoyesky. Forget it,
it's too heavy. -Wait!

42:40.046 --> 42:42.629
Let me try something.

42:46.046 --> 42:48.546
My friends!

42:48.629 --> 42:51.588
Oops! -Beta! -Sorry!

42:55.254 --> 42:58.463
Sorry about that, Darcos.

42:59.796 --> 43:03.713
Thank you my friends, thank you.
-No problem.

43:10.088 --> 43:12.129
Selenia ...

43:12.379 --> 43:16.004
I know you hate me
and you have every reason to.

43:16.129 --> 43:19.713
My whole life I have tried
to massacre your people.

43:20.546 --> 43:23.713
Now you go and save me.

43:23.754 --> 43:29.213
My whole life I've gone after my father,
and now he abandoned me... again.

43:31.671 --> 43:36.463
Darcos, I think he just didn't see you.
We're tiny you know? -Ya, ya we know!

43:36.546 --> 43:41.212
What's the difference? Big or small,
he never loved me.

43:53.796 --> 43:57.254
You know, it's not always
been easy for me with my dad.

43:57.337 --> 44:01.462
I always feel like he never understands me.
But I think he loves me.

44:01.504 --> 44:05.587
Maybe not how I liked him to, but in
his own way, I'm sure he does.

44:05.671 --> 44:08.129
Really?

44:08.546 --> 44:14.837
Arthur? My God, where is my son?
-Don't worry, I'll take care of him!

44:20.004 --> 44:24.962
Now that you've got what you want?
I'm gonna ask you to leave this house.
- I will!

44:25.046 --> 44:28.129
On one condition.
-Now, that's a surprise.

44:28.212 --> 44:33.046
In a few days I would have gathered
enough slaves to build a magnificent palace.

44:33.129 --> 44:39.129
Every Sunday I want Daisy to bring
me one of her famous chocolate pies.

44:39.212 --> 44:43.254
I thought you have no sense of taste.
And all your senses are rotten. -True.

44:43.504 --> 44:46.546
But I still have my imagination.

44:46.629 --> 44:49.671
Well? -I'll do it.

44:49.754 --> 44:53.504
I will be outside your palace every
Sunday with a chocolate pie. I give you my word.

44:53.587 --> 44:56.337
I can't wait for Sunday!

44:56.421 --> 45:00.629
We have to catch up with them before
he disappears again. -Why does he
always want to be bigger...

45:00.712 --> 45:04.379
...when he's already a hundred times
bigger than a nutball field?
-He didn't take the vial for his own use.

45:04.504 --> 45:06.712
It must be to build an army!
-Army?

45:06.837 --> 45:09.629
How do we fight them when they grow that big?
-I have no idea!

45:09.754 --> 45:12.212
For now, let's try to keep him
in our sight.

45:17.462 --> 45:23.879
Arthur, you know how to fly these things?
-No, but it can't be any more complicated than
flying a ladybug.

45:26.296 --> 45:29.171
Wait, wait friends!

45:31.046 --> 45:35.421
I want to go with you! I know my father,
I could be very useful to you.

45:35.462 --> 45:40.462
I'm afraid you'll take us over the weight limit.
-Don't leave me here, I don't want to be alone!

45:40.546 --> 45:46.171
I'll curl up real small. -Darcos, wait here for us.
I give you my word, we'll come back for you.

45:48.171 --> 45:52.254
Really?
My word of honor as a Princess.

45:52.379 --> 45:54.712
Oh, all right!

46:12.046 --> 46:17.087
No, I don't want to wait here for you!
I want to fight too! I am a warrior!

46:21.296 --> 46:24.587
It can't be more complicated
than driving a mosquito.

46:29.962 --> 46:33.171
I bet that's the last we see of him.
-I hope!

46:33.254 --> 46:35.837
But where is Arthur?

46:47.671 --> 46:52.046
He heading for the forest? -What?
-All we have to do now is follow.

46:57.212 --> 47:00.212
Ah! It just know when to stop. No?

47:46.587 --> 47:49.587
Ah... my brave and proud warriors!

47:49.629 --> 47:53.170
I am here, as promised!

47:54.712 --> 47:58.045
I knew I could count
on you, my loyal soldiers!

47:58.170 --> 48:02.379
The time has come for us
to take revenge!

48:03.754 --> 48:06.837
Place your trust in me
and I'll repay that trust!

48:06.962 --> 48:12.712
Hey, What's he saying?
-Nothing special! The usual "blah, blah,
thank you for coming...

48:12.795 --> 48:16.420
...I am proud of you ... "
-I am proud of you!

48:17.420 --> 48:21.962
But that's enough talk! It's time for
action! Let's get this party started!

48:32.587 --> 48:38.045
Selenia, can you just explain your plan to me?
-There's one person who can produce a similar potion.

48:38.129 --> 48:42.545
Powerful enough to break the spell and
bring you back to original size. -That's wonderful...

48:42.629 --> 48:46.087
...but where does this person live?
-On the other side of the forest.

48:46.129 --> 48:50.045
Alright! so, let's find some transportation.
-Duh... what do you think I'm doing?

48:50.087 --> 48:53.837
Selenia, the only thing you'll attract
with a couple of petals is...

48:57.629 --> 49:00.295
A Bee?
-Yes!

49:05.920 --> 49:09.587
Excuse me.
-Oh, no. -O yes!

49:12.129 --> 49:16.754
Beta, we are not going to fly on a bee.
-Not comfortable enough for you, sir? -It is not that!

49:16.837 --> 49:21.795
You'll see. It's more fun than an airplane!
-It's just that ... I am allergic...

49:23.129 --> 49:27.629
...to bee stings.
-Arthur, hurry! Jump!

49:27.795 --> 49:30.295
Come on, Jump!
-Oh, boy!

49:39.045 --> 49:44.045
Let's see. We have augured
another big one! You can take these as well.

49:44.170 --> 49:47.254
This should be good
right on it!

49:47.545 --> 49:51.754
Thank you, miss. The ambulance will be here
about twenty minutes.

49:56.837 --> 50:00.129
Have I been asleep long?

50:04.837 --> 50:07.295
Let get some fresh air.
-Ok.

50:14.212 --> 50:16.379
Oh, not that!

50:22.129 --> 50:25.545
I think we've been spotted!
-About time too!

50:30.379 --> 50:32.129
Ok, let's go.

50:37.254 --> 50:40.878
My humble respect, Your Majesty.
-Save your breath, she doesn't understand.

50:41.003 --> 50:43.795
Beta, go get the interpreter.
-On the way, boss.

50:47.837 --> 50:52.462
Betameche, what's got into you
waking people up like that?
-We need you to translate.

50:52.503 --> 50:56.670
Oh, I asked for a quiet job, not while I'm
constantly being pestered! -Ya, ya.

50:56.753 --> 51:00.920
Really? You've lots of visitors?
-Nope, you are the first. I hope the last.

51:01.003 --> 51:04.837
Just translate what I have to say and we'll
be out of here before you know it? -It's a deal.

51:06.920 --> 51:12.503
I'm Selenia of Metrodoy, 16th of the
name, and I bow down before your majesty.

51:13.378 --> 51:17.212
She thanks you and asks by what right you
entered the palace without invitations.

51:17.295 --> 51:20.170
The evil M has escaped!

51:21.462 --> 51:24.420
If we do not stop him,
our world will become his.

51:24.503 --> 51:27.587
Our life will become a nightmare.
We must join forces...

51:27.670 --> 51:31.462
...and stop him before it is too late!
-Ya! Well said!

51:33.295 --> 51:38.128
The Queen asks what are you going to bring to the
party of 500 bees armed with poison stingers?

51:38.212 --> 51:41.795
She has a point, you know. Just one sting
and we're dead.

51:43.003 --> 51:48.045
The Queen asks what your tragedy is?
-My tragedy? What tragedy?

51:51.628 --> 51:56.628
Oh, your strategy? My mistake. The Queen
has slightly expiate anybody pointing it out.

51:56.670 --> 52:00.837
Our strategy is simple.
We have here our best knight!

52:00.920 --> 52:05.545
His name is Arthur. He knows
the human world because it is his own!

52:13.420 --> 52:16.003
Step back.

52:19.212 --> 52:22.753
What did he say?
-The young bee says she recognizes Arthur.

52:22.837 --> 52:27.587
He saved her life one day after she was caught in a trap.
The young Prince eased her legs out of the trap one by one.

52:27.670 --> 52:32.503
Blew unto her 'till she can breathe again
and then fly away!

52:34.962 --> 52:39.295
Thank you, thank you.
It was the least I could do.

52:46.587 --> 52:49.503
The Queen asks how she can
reward the young hero.

52:49.587 --> 52:52.753
By giving him the elixir of life!

52:54.962 --> 53:00.670
What's going on? -Know that the elixir of life is
made in the fall, if he makes it now,
then they won't have any for winter.

53:00.753 --> 53:03.753
The people must decide.

53:06.920 --> 53:09.212
She agrees!

53:10.503 --> 53:12.587
We are saved!

53:12.670 --> 53:17.920
We are doomed! I'm telling you there're
thousands of them and much bigger than last year.

53:18.003 --> 53:21.253
Francis, right now
I have a maniac on the loose.

53:21.337 --> 53:26.253
Bugs are not high on the priority list
of things to do. So, go home!

53:27.170 --> 53:29.712
Chief!
-What now?

53:29.795 --> 53:33.962
I think you should see this.

53:38.670 --> 53:40.628
What?!

53:44.712 --> 53:48.795
Oh, my God!
-I told you!

53:49.253 --> 53:51.628
Call for reinforcements!

54:07.587 --> 54:12.670
Hey there. Didn't we say noon?
Noon... right on the dot!

54:12.961 --> 54:16.836
Actually, we sent for a doctor or an ambulance.
-Pardon me? Are we too late?

54:16.961 --> 54:20.586
The boy was being stung?
-No, Why would you think he's been stung?

54:20.670 --> 54:24.420
I called them so there's
no chance of getting stung.

54:24.503 --> 54:28.211
Come on, guys, get the
ladder out! -Alright, Chief!

54:28.670 --> 54:32.670
Every animal  has a role to play
in the chain of life.

54:32.753 --> 54:35.045
Like spokes on a bicycle wheel.

54:35.128 --> 54:40.920
Take one out and you can find yourself
flat on your face.
-Archibald, Arthur is allergic to bees!

54:41.420 --> 54:45.920
One little sting could be fatal.
I know haven't been the world's best father...

54:46.045 --> 54:50.295
But all of this has opened my eyes.
I love my son.

54:50.420 --> 54:55.628
From now on, I'm taking personal
Responsibility? The hive is toast!

54:55.753 --> 55:00.045
Captain, this way. It's bit of a march
to the forest, so chup, chup!

55:00.128 --> 55:03.211
Let's go, let's go!
-This way!

55:06.878 --> 55:11.420
Will she be much longer?
-No, look, the drop's starting to appear!

55:13.628 --> 55:17.545
Amazing!
-She did it!

55:21.128 --> 55:24.586
What was that?
-That is not a good sign!

55:24.878 --> 55:27.545
Alright, let's do this carefully.

55:34.961 --> 55:39.670
Don't you think we should look for Arthur
before we take care of these poor little insects?

55:39.753 --> 55:44.128
No, no, no. Let me remind you that if these 'poor'
little insects attack Arthur, he won't survive!

55:44.211 --> 55:47.378
I know, but we don't even
know where he is.

55:50.961 --> 55:56.170
Oh no, it's my father! He's coming with the firefighters!
-Wow! That's cool!

55:56.503 --> 56:00.920
What is a firefighter? Usually, they put out
fire, but today I think they're going to start one.

56:01.003 --> 56:04.461
Why would they want to burn the hive?
This is the bees' home as much as theirs.

56:04.545 --> 56:08.920
My father must be doing it to protect me.
-To protect you, he's happy to terminate the whole family?

56:08.961 --> 56:11.753
I know it's not right,
but he is worried about me.

56:11.878 --> 56:14.170
I'm allergic to bee sting.
Just one sting could kill me.

56:14.295 --> 56:17.753
So, he thought ... -Hold on!,
You mean you're surrounded by hundreds of bees...

56:17.836 --> 56:21.545
...when a single sting might have killed you?
-We didn't have much choice.

56:21.628 --> 56:24.420
Wow! That's what I call a hero!
-Thanks.

56:24.545 --> 56:28.878
That's what I call an 'idiot'!
A selfish idiot! What would become
of me if I lost now?

56:28.961 --> 56:32.920
I suppose that's your way of
saying you care about me.
-Of course I care about you!

56:33.003 --> 56:35.586
I don't want to finish this adventure
on my own, ok!

56:35.670 --> 56:38.461
Now hurry up and warn your parents
not to massacre us all!

56:38.545 --> 56:43.086
I'll go tell the Queen, "Arthur" is allergic
to her entire family.

56:45.003 --> 56:48.878
Wait, I have an idea! We could
all call out together, "Dad!"

56:48.961 --> 56:53.045
No, no, they won't hear us over
the noise of the bees.
-Yeah, you're right.

56:53.420 --> 56:57.836
They can't hear us,
but maybe they'll see us.

57:03.503 --> 57:07.253
The equipment is brand new,
never been used before.

57:07.378 --> 57:11.253
Well, I'm delighted to attend the
grand premiere.
-Here, Chief.

57:11.336 --> 57:14.253
Everything secured?!
-Yes, Sir!!

57:19.336 --> 57:22.503
You OK, Chief?
-Yeah... you holding on good?!

57:22.586 --> 57:26.086
Not to worry, not to worry.
They're highly trained professionals.

57:27.753 --> 57:31.461
I think I'll help out.
Let me lend a hand!

57:31.503 --> 57:35.836
Thanks, sir.
-He has climbed a ladder before. hasn't he?

57:35.920 --> 57:40.461
No! -You're there yet, Chief?!
-Almost!

57:42.753 --> 57:45.336
You guys holding on?
-We got it!

57:51.711 --> 57:53.169
Honey?

57:53.253 --> 57:55.544
Hurry up, hurry up!

58:00.878 --> 58:03.003
MOM

58:03.044 --> 58:06.044
Your glasses, mom,
your glasses!

58:13.628 --> 58:16.544
IT'S ME

58:17.669 --> 58:19.628
Oh, yes!

58:23.503 --> 58:26.878
Arthur? Arthure, where are you?
-Rose, calm down!

58:26.961 --> 58:29.628
Arthur, Where are you?

58:34.461 --> 58:37.003
Oh, 'IN THE HIVE'!

58:41.086 --> 58:42.753
Oh, no!

58:42.794 --> 58:45.044
Honey?

58:52.253 --> 58:53.878
It worked!

58:56.919 --> 59:00.294
Honey, I'm here, wake up!

59:01.836 --> 59:05.128
Arthur is here!
-Honey, calm down!

59:05.169 --> 59:08.419
He's right here, I'm telling you!
-Ok, ok... where?

59:08.503 --> 59:13.919
In the bee hive! -Yes, right, of course,
in the the bee hive. -Yes!

59:14.378 --> 59:18.294
The bees told me!
-Did they? You speak bee now!

59:18.419 --> 59:24.711
No, no I can't speak it!
But I can read it!

59:25.336 --> 59:32.336
Honey, what are you talking about?
-Armand, I don't know how or why...

59:32.419 --> 59:37.711
But I assure you that our son is in that hive
you're about to destroy!

59:37.794 --> 59:41.003
Do something before
you make a tragic mistake!

59:41.086 --> 59:46.419
You understand me?!
-Yeah, I understand!

59:51.919 --> 59:54.253
Second attempt!

59:55.419 --> 01:00:00.753
Captain? -Yes?
-Perhaps your failure on the first attempt...

01:00:00.836 --> 01:00:07.836
...is a sign!  A sign we should let nature
take its course! After all, nature is like...

01:00:08.669 --> 01:00:14.086
a big wheel, isn't it! You take one spoke out
and the whole thing can come crashing down!

01:00:14.503 --> 01:00:17.753
I'm not here to interfere with
the order of the universe...

01:00:17.836 --> 01:00:21.003
...simply to fulfil a mission
I was given!

01:00:21.128 --> 01:00:24.836
Do you read me? -Yes!
-Captain Bowery?
-Here Chief, it's for you.

01:00:26.336 --> 01:00:30.669
Captain Bowery here, Commander.
-Abandon the operation and get back to town!

01:00:30.753 --> 01:00:34.294
Affirmative, commander.
Unit we're withdrawing!

01:00:34.378 --> 01:00:36.336
Yes, sir!

01:00:36.461 --> 01:00:39.878
What about the bees, sir?
-We will be back later.

01:00:39.961 --> 01:00:42.919
Don't worry, don't come back.
-Thank you.

01:00:45.919 --> 01:00:49.086
Captain, captain what happened?

01:00:49.253 --> 01:00:53.211
Nothing! We had to go away
before we can take care of the hive.

01:00:53.253 --> 01:00:55.878
They need reinforcement in town.

01:01:08.253 --> 01:01:13.002
Selenia are you sure you don't
want to come with me? Nobody is as good with
the sword as you are.

01:01:13.086 --> 01:01:16.836
My father is getting old. Somebody has to
take care of our kingdom.

01:01:16.877 --> 01:01:20.419
And I promised Darcos
that I wouldn't abandon him.
-Oh, yeah, that's true.

01:01:20.502 --> 01:01:25.086
Each to his own world, is that it?
-Yes, but our two worlds need each other.

01:01:25.169 --> 01:01:28.419
They are inseparable.
-Just like us?

01:01:28.711 --> 01:01:31.669
Like us.
Now go on, beat it!

01:01:41.461 --> 01:01:45.502
So, what does it taste like, huh?
-Honey. -Is that all?

01:01:45.586 --> 01:01:49.002
Take care of yourself, Arthur.
The battle you will be facing will be a hard one.

01:01:49.086 --> 01:01:53.169
The hardest thing will be to wait
ten months to see you again, Selenia!

01:01:53.252 --> 01:01:58.461
I'll count every minute that we are apart.
-And I'll count every second.

01:02:07.544 --> 01:02:09.377
Arthur?

01:02:14.294 --> 01:02:16.627
Arthur!

01:02:22.711 --> 01:02:25.627
Arthur, are you okay?

01:02:30.711 --> 01:02:36.211
Crazy how good looking he is as a Minimoy,
and how ugly he is as a human.

01:03:12.377 --> 01:03:13.961
Honey?

01:03:14.086 --> 01:03:19.711
I think it wouldn't be a good idea if
talk to people about your visions.

01:03:19.794 --> 01:03:23.044
What visions?
-Ah, what visions? I don't know!

01:03:23.086 --> 01:03:27.169
Arthur living in a hive, surrounded by
bees that can read and write.

01:03:29.211 --> 01:03:32.419
A giant ant.

01:03:33.044 --> 01:03:38.169
With blue spots I suppose?
-No. It has got a pink one on his head.

01:03:38.961 --> 01:03:43.086
I'll make you some chamomile tea.
That will soothe your nerves.
-Right.

01:03:52.377 --> 01:03:54.252
Hi!

01:03:55.377 --> 01:03:59.211
Have we met?
Go away

01:04:00.211 --> 01:04:03.669
I didn't mean to do that.
I'm sorry.

01:04:03.752 --> 01:04:06.586
That was very clumsy of me.

01:04:13.502 --> 01:04:17.461
There! Now we're even.

01:04:19.211 --> 01:04:21.669
No hard feelings.

01:04:28.627 --> 01:04:30.586
Hi!

01:04:37.627 --> 01:04:43.252
Something tells me
it's right under my nose.

01:04:58.044 --> 01:05:01.210
Hello, Darcos.
-Hello!

01:05:02.127 --> 01:05:04.252
Oh, no!

01:05:17.752 --> 01:05:21.252
Don't worry, I'm not
going to hurt you.

01:05:21.794 --> 01:05:25.960
I just want to know
where Arthur is. Is he ok?

01:05:27.044 --> 01:05:29.544
Now speak up a bit,
I can't hear you now.

01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:32.169
He is OK!

01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:36.460
Sorry, I can't hear a thing
you're saying? Don't move!

01:05:42.585 --> 01:05:44.710
Move closer.

01:05:52.502 --> 01:05:54.627
Hello!

01:05:55.544 --> 01:05:58.210
Can you hear me?!
-Yes, I can hear you.

01:05:58.294 --> 01:06:02.502
It's me, Darcos!
-I know it's you! -Archie?

01:06:03.294 --> 01:06:09.335
What's happening? -Eh... nothing, I was just scanning
the radio for news about Arthur.

01:06:09.419 --> 01:06:13.544
Let me know if you hear anything?
-You will be the first to know.

01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:25.419
Darcos, We're running out of time.
You have to tell me all you know.

01:06:26.127 --> 01:06:27.960
OK!

01:06:33.002 --> 01:06:35.877
Wonderful! Wonderful!

01:06:38.877 --> 01:06:41.252
Wonderful!

01:06:41.377 --> 01:06:46.460
You were lucky. I had a client with a
car just like this but he got hit from behind.

01:06:46.627 --> 01:06:49.294
So, I stole a couple of pieces.

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:53.252
Wonderful! -It's for you!
-Just ..

01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:55.627
Wonderful!

01:06:55.669 --> 01:06:59.544
Do you take cheques? -Sure, cheques, credit cards,
cash. You name it, I'll take it.

01:06:59.627 --> 01:07:01.085
Of course!

01:07:15.627 --> 01:07:19.419
This can't be more complicated
than driving a beetle.

01:07:23.044 --> 01:07:27.169
Oh, I know that sound anywhere.
Music to my ears. -It's a magnificent motor.

01:07:27.294 --> 01:07:32.460
Check out the vibrato, like a Mozart
symphony. -Yes, it's a real pleasure to drive.

01:07:32.544 --> 01:07:35.252
My thought exactly!

01:07:36.419 --> 01:07:38.335
Hey, buddy!

01:07:38.419 --> 01:07:42.502
Arthur, son! You're safe and sound!

01:07:49.085 --> 01:07:54.252
Archibald, let me help. I know my father.
I know his strengths and weaknesses.

01:07:54.335 --> 01:07:58.002
Help me into your world and together
we'll take him down! -Ah, don't worry.

01:07:58.127 --> 01:08:01.294
Arthur is probably on his tail
and I'll be there to lend a hand.

01:08:01.377 --> 01:08:05.752
Archie, with every beat my father probably
has already raised a human-sized army...

01:08:05.835 --> 01:08:11.668
...and is ready to invade the world. Do you
want us to think a boy and his grandfather
are enough to stop him?

01:08:15.793 --> 01:08:18.877
You're probably right.

01:08:21.710 --> 01:08:27.167
But if I bring you into our world,
what proof do I have that you won't side
with your father again?

01:08:27.292 --> 01:08:29.752
And help him terrorize us?

01:08:29.835 --> 01:08:33.377
I did not want to terrorize anyone.
I just wanted to be normal.

01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:35.835
To do normal things,
have a normal life.

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:41.627
All I wanted to do is hang out with my friends.
You know, go to the park, play ball.

01:08:46.667 --> 01:08:48.752
Careful!

01:08:51.502 --> 01:08:56.502
Archie, I have to convince my father
for his sake and for mine.

01:08:56.585 --> 01:09:02.710
The chaos and destructions are self-defeating.
You can't cure pain with more pain.

01:09:19.417 --> 01:09:23.752
You, you kept all the bottles hidden?
-I know your dad.

01:09:25.292 --> 01:09:29.752
From animals,
From animals to plants...

01:09:29.835 --> 01:09:33.877
For plants to Minimoy.
From Minimoja to. .. Bingo!

01:09:35.335 --> 01:09:40.335
You sure this is the right one?
-Only one way to find out.

01:09:47.627 --> 01:09:50.877
Oh, oh, looks like Darcos
is in a tight squeeze.

01:10:00.252 --> 01:10:03.877
And I have a feeling that
Archibald is making a mistake!

01:10:14.168 --> 01:10:17.043
Big mistake!

01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:22.835
Show time!

01:10:25.502 --> 01:10:28.960
My God!
-Never seen anything like this?

01:10:31.252 --> 01:10:36.335
What are they?! -They're giant mosquitoes!
-Giant mosquitoes!

01:10:39.502 --> 01:10:41.668
I've never seen anything like it.

01:10:52.127 --> 01:10:56.960
Douglas? -Yes, Chief? -You're from New York...
think...what creatures are they?

01:10:57.043 --> 01:11:00.543
They are not from New York, Sir!

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:07.460
Careful the boy!

01:11:13.043 --> 01:11:16.377
Get out of there!
It's going to blow!

01:11:17.002 --> 01:11:20.460
Take cover!
Let's get out of here!

01:11:39.043 --> 01:11:41.960
Go ahead, tell me, I want
to know how things work here.

01:11:42.043 --> 01:11:44.251
Who is corrupt?
Who can be trusted?

01:11:44.335 --> 01:11:47.126
Above all, who
controls the reins of business?

01:11:47.210 --> 01:11:51.210
That's me. I'm the mayor
this wonderful town.

01:11:51.293 --> 01:11:54.960
Population 1,500.

01:11:55.085 --> 01:11:58.918
You know, we're not really
about business.

01:11:59.043 --> 01:12:03.085
Our comfort and security
are what matter most.

01:12:03.626 --> 01:12:06.835
Well ... that's about to change.

01:12:16.126 --> 01:12:18.460
Chief look out!

01:12:18.626 --> 01:12:23.168
It's going to explode!
Go! Go!

01:12:50.001 --> 01:12:52.835
Hi.
-Hello.

01:12:53.835 --> 01:12:58.210
I love your hair.
-Really? Thanks.

01:13:00.418 --> 01:13:05.043
Honey, is everything okay?
-I am fine! -Glad to hear it!

01:13:05.876 --> 01:13:07.876
Perfect!
-Come with me!

01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:10.793
Coming Archie! Bye!

01:13:11.126 --> 01:13:14.626
I will let you drive.
I forgot my glasses.

01:13:14.710 --> 01:13:18.876
You think you'll be ok? -It can't be
more complicated than flying a mosquito, Archie.

01:13:19.501 --> 01:13:21.460
Maybe.

01:13:33.293 --> 01:13:35.585
Let's go!

01:13:45.918 --> 01:13:50.043
Tell me when you see the vial
that turns Minimoy into Hercules.

01:13:50.418 --> 01:13:52.668
This is the one we want.

01:13:52.751 --> 01:13:56.001
Baby, fill her up!

01:14:01.876 --> 01:14:06.793
Oh, oh don't die on me now!
-This is the insurance company...

01:14:06.876 --> 01:14:10.960
...that only opens once a week.
Although I think it could be a little busier now.

01:14:11.418 --> 01:14:15.001
And this is the new restaurant
that has just opened.

01:14:15.376 --> 01:14:20.126
M for Maltazard?
-Yes, of course!

01:14:26.793 --> 01:14:29.085
My goodness!

01:14:29.126 --> 01:14:30.543
Oh, no!

01:14:38.585 --> 01:14:40.793
Sorry!

01:14:51.251 --> 01:14:53.085
Get him!

01:15:08.876 --> 01:15:11.043
Here, let's go!

01:16:06.209 --> 01:16:08.043
Put it back!

01:16:18.334 --> 01:16:23.251
Chief, the hole is too small. We will
never make it through! -He's right, Chief!
-Go around you idiots!

01:16:33.043 --> 01:16:35.793
Arthur?
-At your service!

01:16:39.626 --> 01:16:41.668
Grab him!

01:16:54.043 --> 01:16:57.418
Oh, God, if you want to help me,
it's NOW!

01:17:04.751 --> 01:17:06.751
Grab him!

01:17:30.334 --> 01:17:34.918
You are doing just fine. -Thanks.
-Try not to be so tense. Just relax.
-OK.

01:17:35.168 --> 01:17:36.876
Good.

01:17:40.084 --> 01:17:42.334
That's much better!

01:17:54.751 --> 01:17:56.959
Archie ... Archie ...

01:18:44.876 --> 01:18:48.959
From now on, if you don't mind,
I will run the show.

01:18:49.084 --> 01:18:51.376
Grab him!

01:18:54.542 --> 01:18:59.084
I hope we're not too late.
-We'll find out in five minutes! Hurry!

01:19:26.334 --> 01:19:30.084
Mine, what a sorry sight.
Darcos, we have to do something.

01:19:30.167 --> 01:19:32.834
Yeah, ok. How about
we kill 'em all.

01:19:32.917 --> 01:19:37.417
I'm thinking of something a little less
radical. -Oh, Yeah, ok, I'm sorry.

01:19:38.917 --> 01:19:41.251
Thank you, thank you.

01:19:41.626 --> 01:19:46.876
Now that our message has been
fully understood, it's pay-back time!

01:19:47.001 --> 01:19:50.501
This traitor will be the first
to pay!

01:19:50.584 --> 01:19:54.084
His punishment
must be exemplary.

01:19:54.167 --> 01:20:00.126
Proportionate to his insolence!
Without compassion and without pity!

01:20:00.751 --> 01:20:04.334
Release him!

01:20:09.501 --> 01:20:15.001
Release him "immediately"!

01:20:15.667 --> 01:20:19.417
Come on, let me go.
You heard him! -Listen to your Master...

01:20:19.501 --> 01:20:22.876
...if you don't want him to crush you
into dust like you did this city!

01:20:23.001 --> 01:20:26.959
Arthur! -Grandpa! -My boy,
I'm so happy to see you again!

01:20:27.084 --> 01:20:29.501
You arrived just at
the right time.

01:20:31.001 --> 01:20:36.167
Ah, Darcos, how painful it is to be
overwhelmed by both sadness and joy.

01:20:36.209 --> 01:20:40.417
The joy of seeing you again alive and
well after so long.

01:20:40.501 --> 01:20:45.001
And there is the pain. For what is worse,
than to be misunderstood by his own child.

01:20:45.084 --> 01:20:48.376
The child that you abandoned!
Oh, no, Darcos...

01:20:48.459 --> 01:20:52.167
...have never abandoned you.
I looked everywhere for you.

01:20:52.251 --> 01:20:57.209
Under every rock, every shattered
building in our ruin of a kingdom!

01:20:57.251 --> 01:21:01.417
The shame that I carried was I
left my son a tragedy to inherit...

01:21:01.501 --> 01:21:05.459
...instead of a triumph. My son should
have grandeur and power?

01:21:05.542 --> 01:21:09.001
I worked constantly to rebuild
our empire.

01:21:09.084 --> 01:21:12.376
In a secret hope that we will
be reunited one day!

01:21:12.459 --> 01:21:16.084
And being able to hand it over to you!

01:21:16.209 --> 01:21:22.292
To... to me? -I know that you have
suffered greatly but one cuts an
empire out of stone.

01:21:23.001 --> 01:21:26.334
Not the wood of a weeping willow.

01:21:26.376 --> 01:21:30.792
Your suffering in the past
is your strength in the future.

01:21:32.126 --> 01:21:34.709
Really?
-Of course! Look!

01:21:34.792 --> 01:21:39.959
My valiant warriors, allow me to
introduce to you he who, better than I, will...

01:21:40.042 --> 01:21:46.251
...lead you to victory. He has youth,
He has strength. A modern leader for the modern world!

01:21:46.376 --> 01:21:51.667
Please, give a triumphant welcome
to your new supreme commander!

01:22:02.542 --> 01:22:04.542
Poor fool!

01:22:10.167 --> 01:22:14.709
I don't get it. Who is the master?
The one before or the one who just fell?

01:22:14.750 --> 01:22:17.584
Just keep your mouth shut
if you want to get paid.

01:22:22.417 --> 01:22:27.625
Oh, no! You think Maltazard
did all this? -It's his style.

01:22:31.584 --> 01:22:35.917
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
-Ah... my friends...

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.959
I must confess, you were
worthy opponents...

01:22:39.042 --> 01:22:42.709
...but the hour of your defeat has come!
That's life.

01:22:42.792 --> 01:22:49.542
Arthur, the knives at my shins.
Take them now.
-I dreamed of a whole deeper wonderful...

01:22:49.625 --> 01:22:53.959
Arthur, you know what you're doing? -Yes.
-... but you're brave. Your tenace...

01:22:54.042 --> 01:22:59.875
...deserves respect and encourage a more
sober approach and so, you'll die without pain.

01:23:00.625 --> 01:23:06.834
Great news.
-I will even show you my heartfelt admiration
by according you a last wish.

01:23:06.917 --> 01:23:10.959
Which of you wishes to die first?
-Me!

01:23:11.292 --> 01:23:15.959
I prefer to save the best for last.
-Bring me that one!

01:23:17.584 --> 01:23:19.750
Arthur!

01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:27.542
Beta, hurry! Quick!
-OK!

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.709
Do you have anything to say, young Arthur,
before we go our separate ways?

01:23:32.792 --> 01:23:37.375
I shall be seeing you in the depths of hell.
-Be my guest!

01:23:37.459 --> 01:23:39.459
Faster, Beta! Go!

01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:46.125
Now!

01:23:49.584 --> 01:23:52.042
Ready to fire!

01:23:53.542 --> 01:23:55.667
And fire!

01:24:02.084 --> 01:24:06.584
What's happening to me? I'm shrinking, Archie!
What's going on?

01:24:06.709 --> 01:24:11.584
You're not much joy. You'll just
have to forget your dreams of greatness.

01:24:15.959 --> 01:24:19.834
Go back to where you belong!
-No! I don't want to be small again!

01:24:19.917 --> 01:24:22.042
Archibald, I beg you!

01:24:25.542 --> 01:24:27.667
Men, come to me!

01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:41.917
Wow, our liberator.

01:24:52.792 --> 01:24:58.792
Maltazard, don't go! You will be crushed!
-Death is no concern to me! I am a soldier!

01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:02.834
Go, go back, stay!
I will take care of this! Go!

01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:11.834
Take cover, sir!
-Maltazard?

01:25:16.459 --> 01:25:19.500
Maltazard, stop!

01:25:31.334 --> 01:25:35.292
You'll never capture me!
I'm the Evil M!

01:25:35.375 --> 01:25:39.708
Lord of necropolis!
Emperor of the seven Kingdoms?

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.708
Welcome to your new home!

01:25:47.542 --> 01:25:50.667
Good. Good job.

01:25:51.292 --> 01:25:55.333
Connolly, round up the wounded.
Organize first aid!

01:26:03.167 --> 01:26:05.042
Grandpa!

01:26:06.458 --> 01:26:09.417
Grandfather, Darcos?
-Yes?

01:26:15.125 --> 01:26:18.583
Darcose, are you alright?

01:26:19.750 --> 01:26:22.542
I have seen better days.

01:26:22.667 --> 01:26:27.333
You can't stay here,
follow me. -Oh yeah, ok.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Come on.
Close the door.

01:26:33.750 --> 01:26:35.792
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry!

01:26:38.292 --> 01:26:40.792
Come on! -Sorry... oops!

01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:45.542
Calm down!

01:26:47.667 --> 01:26:51.917
You have to lie low for a while,
while I convince them that you're
really a good guy.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.542
Do you really think that?
-Of course.

01:26:55.667 --> 01:26:58.292
You were wonderful!

01:26:58.375 --> 01:27:01.583
And I'm really proud to count you
as my friend.

01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:08.000
Ouch!!! -Oops, Sorry! I did not
mean to hurt you!

01:27:08.083 --> 01:27:11.375
Are you okay? I'm sorry!
-It's OK.

01:27:11.708 --> 01:27:14.917
Put this cape on.
You're not exactly easy on the eyes.

01:27:21.083 --> 01:27:24.417
Maybe you should put a mask on.
I'll find you a helmet.

01:27:31.667 --> 01:27:33.500
This one!

01:27:40.250 --> 01:27:42.583
Wow, so cool!

01:27:43.083 --> 01:27:45.958
Keep quiet.
I'll be right back.

01:27:50.375 --> 01:27:53.125
Sorry.-Quiet!

01:28:10.458 --> 01:28:13.250
Is anyone there?

01:28:19.333 --> 01:28:21.458
Hi.

01:28:22.167 --> 01:28:26.083
Sorry to bother you, sir
but I'm with the Press.

01:28:26.458 --> 01:28:30.500
I'd like to ask you
a few questions. May I?

01:28:33.042 --> 01:28:38.625
Some town people claimed that they
saw the devil in the middle of the town square.

01:28:38.708 --> 01:28:43.917
And suddenly he started to shrink and
until he just vanished. Can you confirm this?

01:28:46.625 --> 01:28:51.000
Do you mind if I film this?
It's a perfect shot!

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:04.167
Terrific! Did you know him?
Yes, my father!

01:29:17.958 --> 01:29:22.000
Arthur? -Daddy!
-Arthur?

01:29:22.708 --> 01:29:27.333
I'll go on and look.
-My son?

01:29:27.708 --> 01:29:30.833
You're safe and sound!
I'm so happy!

01:29:30.958 --> 01:29:33.416
I really hate myself for being
so tough on you.

01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:37.083
I never listen to you.
I never pay any attention to you!

01:29:37.166 --> 01:29:41.750
But it won't happen again, I promise.
-It's okay! -No, no I promise!

01:29:41.875 --> 01:29:45.791
I'll try to prove that I'm worthy.
...of a son like you.

01:29:45.875 --> 01:29:48.708
I am so happy
to see you, Dad.

01:29:50.458 --> 01:29:52.541
Archibald!

01:29:56.208 --> 01:29:59.541
This warms the old man's heart.

01:29:59.750 --> 01:30:01.708
Thank you.

01:30:02.291 --> 01:30:04.250
Dad.

01:30:11.708 --> 01:30:16.166
Isn't it wonderful to see a
family reunited at last? -Ah, Yes.

01:30:16.250 --> 01:30:18.833
Soon, we will be
reunited with ours.

01:30:18.916 --> 01:30:21.625
See you soon, my PRINCE.

01:30:25.416 --> 01:30:27.791
What a story!

01:30:28.375 --> 01:30:32.541
I can't believe it!
Arthur, look at that!

01:30:32.625 --> 01:30:36.291
It cost me a fortune to have it repair,
and now I just have to start over!

01:30:36.375 --> 01:30:39.041
I suppose you think that cars
grow on trees! -Armand...

01:30:39.125 --> 01:30:44.250
...It is just a car! -Just a car?!
This is a Dodge V8! -It's nothing but a pile of junk!

01:30:44.375 --> 01:30:46.583
It's my car!

01:30:52.166 --> 01:30:55.083
A toast!
-A toast!

01:30:56.041 --> 01:30:58.083
Sorry.

01:30:58.166 --> 01:31:01.083
Could you pass my badge?
-Simon!

01:31:01.458 --> 01:31:04.666
Thank you very much. Sorry, Chief.
-And now, dear friends...

01:31:04.791 --> 01:31:08.125
Daisy's famous
chocolate pie.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.500
I'll cut it!

01:31:15.625 --> 01:31:22.250
Darling, don't! -I think It is probably wise
to leave it to your husband. -Archie!

01:31:22.375 --> 01:31:27.666
Let Rose cut the cake.
She's not clumsier than anybody else.

01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:32.083
She just needs our
encouragement and support.

01:31:32.166 --> 01:31:35.500
Isn't that what this adventure
been about, really?

01:31:35.666 --> 01:31:39.291
About trust and helping
each other.

01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:43.666
Rosie, you cut the pie!

01:31:46.458 --> 01:31:52.416
Thanks, Mom. -Darling, that knife
is very sharp. -Daddy, sit down.

01:32:12.041 --> 01:32:15.500
Last piece is for you mom.

01:32:20.125 --> 01:32:24.500
Well done, Mom.
-Excuse me, just a moment.

01:32:33.291 --> 01:32:37.624
I gave you my word I'll bring you
a chocolate pie every Sunday.

01:32:37.708 --> 01:32:40.874
It's Sunday. Here it is.

01:33:06.041 --> 01:33:11.208
Hi, kids.
It's me, Darcos!

01:33:12.708 --> 01:33:19.374
