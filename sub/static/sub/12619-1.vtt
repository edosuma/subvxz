Captioning made possible by
abc family

00:34.267 --> 00:37.336
we're moving somewhere beyond
cell phone service.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.204
Doesn't that bother you?

00:39.239 --> 00:42.041
Ha ha.
It is so beautiful.

00:42.075 --> 00:44.710
What is? The scrub?

00:44.744 --> 00:46.745
Look at all
the blue sky. Ohh!

00:48.548 --> 00:52.651
Woman on radio:
Domino here at ktqt 91.8...

00:52.685 --> 00:54.219
Civilization!

00:54.254 --> 00:57.556
You give us 2 minutes
and we'll give you
the turquoise trail...

00:57.590 --> 00:59.892
Ha ha!

00:59.926 --> 01:03.362
In our top story,
congratulations
to our bison moms.

01:03.396 --> 01:05.364
There are 7 newborn calves

01:05.397 --> 01:08.434
on the dine bikeyah
buffalo preserve.

01:08.468 --> 01:10.202
She's kidding, right?

01:29.255 --> 01:30.989
Now when I was an army brat,

01:31.024 --> 01:32.825
I relocated to weird islands

01:32.859 --> 01:33.926
in the middle of nowhere.

01:33.960 --> 01:36.728
At least here
they speak English.

01:43.803 --> 01:45.137
What did he say?

01:47.307 --> 01:49.675
Ha ha ha!

01:49.709 --> 01:52.578
We have beef jerky,
buffalo jerky,

01:52.612 --> 01:53.812
moose jerky.

01:53.847 --> 01:55.647
We have aloe gel,

01:55.682 --> 01:57.382
aloe shampoo,

01:57.417 --> 01:59.218
aloe conditioner...

02:02.288 --> 02:03.689
Buckwheat hulls,

02:03.723 --> 02:06.325
birch cones, chickweed,

02:06.359 --> 02:07.526
linden leaf,

02:07.560 --> 02:09.595
wild Turkey jerky,

02:09.628 --> 02:11.830
ah, and my favorite,

02:11.865 --> 02:13.765
rabbit jerky.

02:15.568 --> 02:18.470
Welcome to town.

02:18.505 --> 02:20.973
Thank you.
It's nice to be here.

02:21.007 --> 02:23.308
Try some of our fry bread.

02:23.343 --> 02:24.710
Oh, that's ok.

02:26.112 --> 02:28.747
How about some beef jerky?

02:28.781 --> 02:30.716
No, thanks.

02:35.288 --> 02:38.690
Do you have batteries?

02:38.725 --> 02:39.925
Um, that's ok.

02:39.959 --> 02:42.060
We'll get some later
if we need them.

02:57.644 --> 02:58.810
All right.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.145
Look at the view all around.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.446
Don't freak out.
It's a little sloppy.

03:01.481 --> 03:02.915
But I think you're
gonna love this.

03:04.751 --> 03:06.351
Where is it?

03:06.386 --> 03:08.153
Laundry room.

03:09.255 --> 03:10.222
Where?

03:10.256 --> 03:11.690
Uh, other way.

03:11.724 --> 03:13.358
And don't get too excited.

03:16.462 --> 03:17.863
Take a left.

03:26.773 --> 03:29.141
It's weak, but it's wheels.

03:29.175 --> 03:32.344
Uh-uh.
Not in the house.

03:32.378 --> 03:35.280
Uh...

03:35.315 --> 03:36.481
You got him a bike?

03:36.516 --> 03:37.983
Having his bike stolen

03:38.017 --> 03:39.851
and relocating
for my work again,

03:39.886 --> 03:41.720
that's punishment enough.

03:41.754 --> 03:44.022
Working with you at the lab
will be good for him.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.124
Give him a chance to see
what he can do.

03:46.159 --> 03:47.492
You like it? Hmm?

03:47.527 --> 03:49.294
Mm-hmm.

03:59.072 --> 04:02.140
And it's 3-time champion
Josh townsend

04:02.175 --> 04:03.809
going for the record.

04:03.843 --> 04:05.611
He's coming from behind.

04:05.645 --> 04:08.313
He's about to take the lead.

04:08.348 --> 04:10.082
Wait. There she is...

04:10.116 --> 04:11.850
The competition.

04:11.884 --> 04:13.885
Watch the lady
with the straw bag.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.921
She's crafty, she fakes,

04:15.955 --> 04:17.723
but townsend doesn't flinch.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.291
She's changing strategies.

04:19.325 --> 04:21.760
Josh puts in the power,

04:21.793 --> 04:22.861
steps into gear, and pass...

04:22.895 --> 04:24.296
Hello.

04:24.330 --> 04:26.064
The crowd goes wild!

04:26.099 --> 04:28.700
She is history.

04:28.735 --> 04:30.535
But this race is not over yet.

04:30.570 --> 04:31.837
It's just begun.

04:31.871 --> 04:33.111
Note their fierce concentration

04:33.139 --> 04:34.539
as they plot to destroy me.

04:34.574 --> 04:36.775
But wait till they see this.

04:36.809 --> 04:38.910
Oh, yeah. Be afraid.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.145
Be very afraid.

04:40.179 --> 04:41.913
Stop!

04:43.583 --> 04:45.217
Uhh.

04:47.787 --> 04:49.788
Man: You got to be
kidding me.

04:49.822 --> 04:50.789
Jeez.

04:50.823 --> 04:53.258
Wasn't me.

04:55.795 --> 04:56.762
It's beautiful, isn't it?

04:56.796 --> 04:58.797
Mm-hmm.

04:58.831 --> 05:00.065
You're gonna miss it, Josh!

05:00.099 --> 05:01.833
I know!

05:11.044 --> 05:13.211
Mom!

05:13.246 --> 05:14.313
Dad!

05:14.347 --> 05:16.114
Mother: Josh? Uhh!

05:16.149 --> 05:18.684
Who left luggage
in the middle
of the floor?

05:18.718 --> 05:20.319
Father:
Where's the flashlight?

05:20.353 --> 05:21.853
I got it.

05:25.024 --> 05:26.792
Here.

05:30.763 --> 05:32.764
You got batteries?

05:32.799 --> 05:35.467
Father: Ohh.

05:48.381 --> 05:49.915
May there be beauty
in front of me.

05:49.949 --> 05:52.217
May there be beauty behind me.

05:52.251 --> 05:54.386
May there be beauty to my left.

05:54.420 --> 05:56.588
May there be beauty to my right.

05:56.622 --> 06:00.092
May there be beauty
all around me.

06:52.879 --> 06:56.114
There's no riding here.

06:57.583 --> 06:58.583
Why not?

06:58.618 --> 06:59.918
You can't ride off trail.

06:59.952 --> 07:01.853
You're tearing up
the grasslands.

07:01.888 --> 07:03.955
I don't see any grass.

07:03.990 --> 07:05.657
No dirt heads allowed.

07:05.691 --> 07:06.691
What's a dirt head?

07:06.726 --> 07:08.193
A mountain biker who rides

07:08.227 --> 07:09.561
where he's not allowed.

07:09.595 --> 07:10.729
What do they call you?

07:10.763 --> 07:13.131
Hey!

07:13.166 --> 07:14.166
What's going on?

07:14.200 --> 07:15.500
I was just telling this dirt rag

07:15.535 --> 07:16.501
to get lost.

07:16.536 --> 07:17.869
Who you calling dirt?

07:17.904 --> 07:20.539
Welcome. I'm moon

07:20.573 --> 07:22.574
and this is scout,

07:22.608 --> 07:24.176
granddaughter
of abuela rose blackhorse,

07:24.210 --> 07:25.377
because of a dream
her mother had

07:25.411 --> 07:26.711
when she gave birth.

07:26.746 --> 07:28.213
And this is Thomas blackhorse,

07:28.247 --> 07:29.381
grandson of John blackhorse,

07:29.415 --> 07:33.418
a navajo elder who came
from the near water clan

07:33.453 --> 07:34.586
on his mother's side,

07:34.620 --> 07:36.555
born of the edgewater clan

07:36.589 --> 07:38.790
on his father's side.

07:38.825 --> 07:41.927
Um...

07:41.961 --> 07:43.261
I'm Josh.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.197
I'm not interested.

07:45.231 --> 07:46.731
Can we do this now?

07:46.766 --> 07:49.100
Yeah. Let's bring him in.

07:50.236 --> 07:52.471
You think he's friendly?

07:52.505 --> 07:54.372
Can't always tell.

08:03.883 --> 08:05.617
♪ Bom, bom ♪

08:05.651 --> 08:07.452

08:32.477 --> 08:34.179
We tried every song we knew,

08:34.212 --> 08:37.182
but this is the only one
that worked.

09:08.014 --> 09:12.083
Father: My son's
first day of work.

09:14.186 --> 09:15.520
Dad.

09:15.555 --> 09:16.922
Domino: Good Monday...

09:16.956 --> 09:20.058
We're caught here
in a buffalo dispute

09:20.092 --> 09:23.929
between my guest, veterinarian
Seth touch by lightning,

09:23.963 --> 09:25.497
and our caller, Jean.

09:25.531 --> 09:28.833
So, Jean, want to tell
us why you're so mad?

09:28.868 --> 09:30.702
Jean: Yeah. You're not
gonna believe this.

09:30.736 --> 09:32.971
The buffalo charged my truck.

09:33.005 --> 09:35.674
Domino: All right.
Call us

09:35.708 --> 09:37.042
with your thoughts on bison.

09:37.076 --> 09:40.178
Friend or Fender bender?

09:40.212 --> 09:42.347
But first, here goes
the weather report.

09:42.381 --> 09:45.150
There's a high pressure
moving in...

09:51.390 --> 09:53.692
<i>Adios, amigo.</i>

09:55.695 --> 09:58.730
Yeah, just keep on walking, man.

10:04.236 --> 10:05.737
Father: Doesn't
all this blue sky

10:05.771 --> 10:06.705
make you just want to send up

10:06.739 --> 10:09.140
a robotic exploratory spacecraft

10:09.175 --> 10:11.276
just to find out what
it's really all about?

10:12.278 --> 10:13.318
You could get every channel

10:13.346 --> 10:15.480
if you have one of those.

10:15.514 --> 10:17.916
This is very exciting.

10:17.950 --> 10:19.017
How can you tell?

10:19.051 --> 10:20.318
Some of our greatest thinkers

10:20.353 --> 10:22.387
are right here in this facility.

10:22.421 --> 10:23.788
Welcome to new Mexico

10:23.823 --> 10:26.558
astrophysics research center.

10:26.592 --> 10:27.692
Here's
your I.D. Badge.

10:27.727 --> 10:28.893
How you doing, Virgil?

10:28.928 --> 10:31.997
Branded... Nerd.

10:32.031 --> 10:34.099
That's my boy.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.401
Virgil, I want you
to show Josh
exactly what to do.

10:36.435 --> 10:37.769
All right? Gotta go.
Call you later.

10:37.803 --> 10:39.838
All right.

10:39.872 --> 10:42.273
And this area's
for our databases

10:42.308 --> 10:44.976
of abstracts
and technical reports,

10:45.011 --> 10:47.479
citations and documentation,

10:47.513 --> 10:50.048
and texts of technical reports,

10:50.082 --> 10:52.984
and archives and
distribution systems.

10:53.019 --> 10:55.020
Cool, huh?

10:55.054 --> 10:57.055
Dead man walking.

10:57.089 --> 10:59.224
And here's where
you'll be working.

11:01.394 --> 11:03.495
Virgil:
Copy what's on the cart.

11:30.222 --> 11:33.391
We lose our power a lot, too.

11:33.426 --> 11:36.628
But we always get it back.

11:36.662 --> 11:38.863
I'm talking
about the electricity.

11:38.898 --> 11:39.831
Of course.

11:39.865 --> 11:42.067
We have dried corn,
dried corn soup,

11:42.101 --> 11:43.435
dried corn stew,

11:43.469 --> 11:45.937
and dried corn with squash.

11:45.971 --> 11:48.339
Well, I guess I should
have some of each.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.608
All right.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.380
Is this a new cause?
I'm not familiar with it.

11:55.414 --> 11:56.781
For centuries,

11:56.816 --> 11:59.284
our northern
brothers and sisters

11:59.318 --> 12:00.452
have honored the buffalo,

12:00.486 --> 12:01.820
who provided them with food,

12:01.854 --> 12:04.556
shelter, clothing.

12:04.590 --> 12:06.357
Now we're partnering with them

12:06.392 --> 12:08.259
to restore the herds and...

12:11.630 --> 12:12.931
Yes,

12:12.965 --> 12:14.899
we have buffalo,

12:14.934 --> 12:18.036
and we need teenagers
like your son

12:18.070 --> 12:19.838
to help us out.

12:22.975 --> 12:25.877
I'm sorry. I wish
i knew sign language.

12:25.911 --> 12:28.146
My granddaughter scout is sure

12:28.180 --> 12:29.714
your son would enjoy working

12:29.749 --> 12:32.217
with the herd

12:32.251 --> 12:35.453
much more than the lab.

12:58.644 --> 13:00.211
Sorry.

13:00.246 --> 13:01.513
So I'll make the announcement,

13:01.547 --> 13:02.847
then I'll go into
a short interview,

13:02.882 --> 13:05.316
and open up
into q. And a. Ok?

13:06.819 --> 13:09.821
R.S.V.P.?

13:11.157 --> 13:14.926
We've got Kyle
and his wrecking crew here.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.294
These boys want to test
your bravery

13:16.328 --> 13:18.129
on single track, intermediate,

13:18.164 --> 13:19.898
and advanced trail riding.

13:19.932 --> 13:23.134
So ask yourself,
fellow heartbreaking
thrill-seekers,

13:23.169 --> 13:24.602
can you fly?

13:24.637 --> 13:27.071
Friday at red rocks.
Be there.

13:27.106 --> 13:29.240
Yeah. Say something
like that.

13:29.275 --> 13:30.341
So, like,

13:30.376 --> 13:31.910
are we on the air?

13:33.646 --> 13:35.513
Hey, grandpa.

13:35.548 --> 13:36.548
Hmm?

13:36.582 --> 13:38.616
I'll be graduating
in a couple years,

13:38.651 --> 13:42.854
and I need a real job,
a money job.

13:42.888 --> 13:45.089
I could teach you
to be the next survivor.

13:45.124 --> 13:46.090
Ha ha.

13:46.125 --> 13:47.258
I'm just saying...

13:47.293 --> 13:50.061
Oh, look. Ah.

13:50.095 --> 13:51.930
Monardella odoratissima.

13:51.964 --> 13:53.832
That's mountain pennyroyal.

13:53.866 --> 13:56.501
It's good for food seasoning
and deodorant.

13:56.535 --> 13:58.775
You know, you can cure yourself
and your herd of anything

13:58.804 --> 14:00.338
if you know nature.

14:00.372 --> 14:03.107
You can't get
scout's voice back.

14:05.110 --> 14:06.411
Meanwhile, your work's here,

14:06.445 --> 14:07.712
restoring the buffalo

14:07.746 --> 14:10.315
and taking care
of your community.

14:10.349 --> 14:11.816
I know, but...

14:11.851 --> 14:13.751
The tree has to be
rooted in the ground

14:13.786 --> 14:17.555
before it can grow.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.157
How can you stand
the sweat lodge

14:19.191 --> 14:20.458
in the summer?

14:20.492 --> 14:23.261
You don't even have
a ceremony today.

14:23.295 --> 14:25.897
Certainly a place
your grandma can't get at me.

14:30.502 --> 14:31.970
Hey, what's up?

14:32.004 --> 14:33.738
Well, my editor
wants photographs
of my recipes

14:33.772 --> 14:35.006
for his web site

14:35.040 --> 14:36.040
to go with my book.

14:36.075 --> 14:38.810
Hey! How was work?

14:38.844 --> 14:40.345
Cruel and unusual.

14:40.379 --> 14:43.248
Well, I thought you
found it very creative.

14:43.282 --> 14:45.016
I'm stuck in a tiny room,

14:45.050 --> 14:46.985
alone, with no windows.

14:47.019 --> 14:49.621
I think I like page 19

14:49.655 --> 14:51.122
of the zigna space report
the best.

14:51.156 --> 14:53.858
This... Oh, yeah.
This was my favorite.

14:53.893 --> 14:54.993
Yeah.

14:55.027 --> 14:56.527
See?

14:56.562 --> 14:57.896
I only hope the 37
of my new colleagues

14:57.930 --> 15:00.398
will find my son
as photogenic as we do.

15:00.432 --> 15:01.499
How did that get there?

15:01.533 --> 15:02.533
You know, it was not easy

15:02.568 --> 15:04.168
getting you this job.

15:04.203 --> 15:05.637
Making copies?

15:05.671 --> 15:07.372
It's great exposure.

15:07.406 --> 15:08.740
To radioactivity.

15:08.774 --> 15:11.376
I spoke to a nice navajo today.

15:11.410 --> 15:12.610
They need help

15:12.645 --> 15:14.545
at the dine bikeyah
buffalo preserve

15:14.580 --> 15:15.780
where?

15:15.814 --> 15:18.616
The dine bikeyah
buffalo preserve.

15:18.651 --> 15:20.051
Look outside.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.887
Oh, no. I met the guy
who works there
and he was a jerk.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.156
You could ride your bike.

15:36.168 --> 15:38.469
Bro, look who it is.

15:38.504 --> 15:40.271
Is this supposed to be a joke?

15:40.306 --> 15:43.408
A dirt head to work with us?

15:43.442 --> 15:44.909
Sorry.

15:51.517 --> 15:52.550
What'd she say?

15:52.584 --> 15:53.985
You're gonna tear your hands up.

15:54.019 --> 15:55.954
Try these.

15:55.988 --> 15:56.955
Appreciate it.

15:56.989 --> 15:59.724
So, don't do much work, huh?

15:59.758 --> 16:02.026
I had a job at the research
center for, like, a minute.

16:02.061 --> 16:03.194
You gave up a job there

16:03.228 --> 16:04.662
to be here?

16:04.697 --> 16:05.897
Yeah.

16:05.931 --> 16:07.165
You're nuts.

16:07.199 --> 16:10.735
I'd rather be
riding my bike outside,

16:10.769 --> 16:11.936
free.

16:13.238 --> 16:14.706
This isn't free.

16:14.740 --> 16:15.940
I have to work here.

16:25.184 --> 16:28.219
Come on, let's go!

16:31.290 --> 16:32.724
Hey!

16:33.826 --> 16:34.959
Ha ha!

16:39.531 --> 16:41.265
Very funny!

16:41.300 --> 16:43.434
What do you guys do
for an encore?

16:43.469 --> 16:46.704
Dude, it's safe.

16:51.944 --> 16:53.411
Thomas: Buckle up.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.919
This is a fence pull.

17:04.589 --> 17:07.425
Put the wire through here...

17:08.560 --> 17:09.993
Josh: What's
the big deal?

17:10.029 --> 17:11.963
Well, we don't want any buffalo

17:11.997 --> 17:13.297
running around town.

17:13.332 --> 17:15.165
What are they,
man-eaters?

17:15.200 --> 17:17.201
Moon:
Strictly vegans, dude.

17:17.236 --> 17:18.836
But you don't want
to stress them.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.039
I mean, I've seen them
toss a man

17:21.073 --> 17:22.573
and his Burmese mountain dog

17:22.608 --> 17:23.974
way across the field.

17:24.009 --> 17:25.643
I mean, it was gnarly.

17:25.676 --> 17:27.944
What do you guys do
with the buffalo?

17:27.980 --> 17:29.947
I mean, you don't eat them,
you don't wear them.

17:29.982 --> 17:31.416
They don't make good pets.

17:31.450 --> 17:33.151
It's a native thing.

17:33.185 --> 17:35.153
Oh.

17:35.187 --> 17:38.723
So... Where do you guys
go around here?

17:38.757 --> 17:40.258
The caves are pretty cool,

17:40.292 --> 17:42.593
and the community center
has a new pool.

17:42.628 --> 17:44.162
Not what I meant.

17:44.196 --> 17:45.997
Go anywhere you want.

17:46.031 --> 17:47.765
I'll be right back.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.350

What are you singing?

18:32.344 --> 18:33.744
I wasn't singing.

18:33.779 --> 18:34.745
Yeah, you were.

18:34.780 --> 18:37.248
It wasn't me.

18:37.282 --> 18:39.717
You guys
aren't supposed to
be riding here.

18:39.751 --> 18:40.785
What, are you protecting

18:40.819 --> 18:43.321
some endangered toad or lizard

18:43.355 --> 18:44.522
or scrub brush maybe?

18:44.556 --> 18:47.725
This is restricted
tribal land
for the buffalo.

18:47.759 --> 18:48.960
Come on.

18:48.994 --> 18:50.461
They get 11 million acres,

18:50.496 --> 18:52.096
and we can't ride on a few?

18:52.131 --> 18:55.066
You guys can ride
on the fire roads
and the trails.

18:55.100 --> 18:56.033
Ok,

18:56.068 --> 18:57.635
but there are these moon rocks

18:57.669 --> 18:59.270
in the north end here.

18:59.304 --> 19:01.739
You go right over the boulders
and you catch some big air.

19:01.773 --> 19:03.241
Yeah?

19:03.275 --> 19:04.775
Really sick descent.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.511
Check it out.

19:06.545 --> 19:08.913
Moon: Josh!

19:08.947 --> 19:10.882
Where'd you go, dude?

19:10.916 --> 19:12.183
Over here.

19:12.217 --> 19:14.852
Thought maybe the bulls
got you cornered.

19:14.887 --> 19:16.387
I see they did.

19:16.421 --> 19:19.090
Tell your friends to share.

19:20.359 --> 19:21.459
Boys: Let's go!

19:21.493 --> 19:23.528
Come on!
Whoo!

19:23.562 --> 19:24.662
Later!

19:24.696 --> 19:26.797
See ya!

19:26.832 --> 19:28.399
Watch out...

19:41.797 --> 19:43.197
We should get going.

19:43.232 --> 19:45.166
I'll ride back.

19:45.200 --> 19:47.101
We got some weather coming in.

19:47.135 --> 19:49.737
Not a problem for me.

19:49.771 --> 19:51.439
Suit yourself.

19:51.473 --> 19:52.940
You sure?

19:52.975 --> 19:54.041
It could rain.

19:54.076 --> 19:55.376
You heard what he said.

19:55.410 --> 19:56.611
Let's get going.

20:19.468 --> 20:21.936
Ohh.

20:45.427 --> 20:47.995
Father: Are you ok
in there?

21:07.482 --> 21:09.116
Josh: Let's burn it.

21:09.151 --> 21:11.085
We can't do that.

21:11.119 --> 21:12.186
Why not?

21:12.220 --> 21:14.722
Because we want
to preserve, not destroy

21:14.756 --> 21:17.825
our <i> dinetah,</i> our land
that was given to us

21:17.859 --> 21:19.994
by the ancient
holy ones who came

21:20.028 --> 21:22.596
from the sacred 4 mountains.

21:22.631 --> 21:24.765
Moon, you're Danish.

21:24.800 --> 21:26.467
Maybe in this life.

21:26.501 --> 21:28.970
Ok. Ready? 3, 2...

21:29.004 --> 21:30.037
Uhh!

21:30.072 --> 21:31.372
Ha ha!

21:31.406 --> 21:32.673
Nobody lifts on one.

21:32.708 --> 21:33.674
What?

21:33.709 --> 21:34.842
You count up to 3.

21:34.876 --> 21:38.779
No. It's 3, 2, 1, go.

21:38.814 --> 21:40.681
Like a space launch.

21:40.716 --> 21:42.016
They count down.

21:42.050 --> 21:43.851
But people count up.

21:43.885 --> 21:45.052
Not today.

21:46.555 --> 21:47.822
Whatever.

21:47.856 --> 21:48.956
3, 2, 1.

21:48.991 --> 21:50.291
Uhh!
Uhh!

21:59.001 --> 22:02.737
I could use a little O2
right about now.

22:02.771 --> 22:04.905
Put a fork in me, I'm done.

22:04.940 --> 22:07.074
Not yet.

22:15.817 --> 22:18.552
And this, this is
why we're here.

22:18.587 --> 22:20.621
That's cool.

22:37.939 --> 22:39.607
Awesome.

22:41.743 --> 22:42.877
Don't get too attached.

22:42.911 --> 22:45.446
It's mine.

22:45.480 --> 22:47.214
Just bought it.

22:48.450 --> 22:49.917
Sweet ride.

22:49.951 --> 22:52.253
Lighter, stronger,

22:52.287 --> 22:54.989
and a whole lot faster.

22:55.023 --> 22:56.390
Come out and ride.

22:56.425 --> 22:57.792
You're gonna turn into a stiff

22:57.826 --> 22:59.326
working on the res.

22:59.361 --> 23:00.327
It's not that bad.

23:00.362 --> 23:03.130
Taking orders
from chili-pickers
all summer?

23:03.165 --> 23:04.665
Get real!

23:04.699 --> 23:05.900
Grab a bike

23:05.934 --> 23:08.135
and come out and ride with us.

23:08.170 --> 23:09.970
I mean, they're not
that expensive.

23:11.440 --> 23:14.642
So do you have a team
or a club or what?

23:14.709 --> 23:16.177
Just some thrashers like us.

23:16.211 --> 23:18.779
Cross-country
racing,

23:18.814 --> 23:19.880
enduro riding,

23:19.915 --> 23:21.682
free-ride dropping.

23:21.716 --> 23:22.917
What else could you want?

23:22.951 --> 23:25.619
Sounds cool.

23:25.654 --> 23:27.188
Ahem.

23:29.991 --> 23:33.661
Hey, Friday, we're at red rocks.

23:33.695 --> 23:36.363
See you there?

23:37.999 --> 23:39.433
I think it's time

23:39.468 --> 23:42.603
for one of my famous potlucks.

23:53.849 --> 23:55.649
Ah.

23:55.684 --> 23:57.284
Look at this.

23:57.319 --> 23:59.253
Hi.

24:03.158 --> 24:05.326
Mother:
This is beautiful.

24:09.965 --> 24:11.465
Hey.

24:12.567 --> 24:14.335
Hello.

24:14.369 --> 24:16.537
Yummy.
What are these?

24:16.571 --> 24:20.007
These are my dried
blue corn cheese ball
pick-me-ups.

24:20.041 --> 24:22.376
Perfect with lamb kebobs.

24:22.410 --> 24:24.345
Yeah.

24:24.379 --> 24:26.180
You must be a real chef.

24:26.214 --> 24:29.283
Uh, more of a culinary
anthropologist.

24:29.317 --> 24:33.320
Oh. This is
Thomas blackhorse.

24:33.355 --> 24:34.955
Hello, Thomas blackhorse.

24:34.990 --> 24:36.991
What have you got there?

24:37.025 --> 24:40.594
Who knows?

24:40.629 --> 24:43.397
My grandson doesn't
speak navajo.

24:43.431 --> 24:45.366
He doesn't eat navajo food.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.434
He only eats food

24:47.469 --> 24:50.237
that comes out of a box
or in a bag.

24:50.272 --> 24:51.705
You must be Dr. t.

24:51.740 --> 24:53.474
Welcome. I'm moon.

24:53.508 --> 24:56.143
That's a stellar name.
Ha ha!

24:56.178 --> 24:57.578
Stellar.

24:57.612 --> 24:59.914
Uh, which one are you named for?

24:59.948 --> 25:01.415
Io, europa, or titan?

25:01.449 --> 25:03.450
Zappa.

25:03.485 --> 25:04.952
Pardon?

25:04.986 --> 25:05.920
Titan, for sure.

25:05.954 --> 25:07.721
Oh, good. Ha ha!

25:16.765 --> 25:19.333
You can never see
this many stars
in the city.

25:19.367 --> 25:22.403
It's too bright.

25:22.437 --> 25:24.438
This place is so...

25:24.472 --> 25:28.876
Hot, quiet, boring?

25:28.910 --> 25:31.045
Big.

25:31.079 --> 25:33.147
Nothing ever happens here.

25:33.181 --> 25:36.617
Abuela rose isn't
letting you go anywhere.

25:38.553 --> 25:39.887
Is that your mother?

25:39.921 --> 25:41.088
My grandmother.

25:41.122 --> 25:43.490
She's such a navajo.

25:43.525 --> 25:46.393
She wants me to eat and speak

25:46.428 --> 25:47.595
and live navajo.

25:47.629 --> 25:50.364
My father's such a scientist.

25:50.398 --> 25:53.234
He'd love for me to work
in a lab all my life.

25:53.268 --> 25:57.338
John: My grandson and your son
will become good friends

25:57.372 --> 25:59.440
because you and i
have a lot in common.

25:59.474 --> 26:02.343
You work at the research center?

26:02.377 --> 26:04.111
Nope.

26:04.145 --> 26:07.147
Oh. Oh, I'm an
astrophysicist there.

26:07.182 --> 26:10.718
We have the same mission.

26:10.752 --> 26:12.253
We do?

26:12.320 --> 26:16.523
Well... I've actually
begun to shift my focus

26:16.558 --> 26:18.559
to the laws and origins
of the universe

26:18.593 --> 26:21.695
and... and
the evolutionary
process there

26:21.730 --> 26:24.798
so we can
more effectively, um...

26:24.833 --> 26:26.734
Protect our atmosphere

26:26.768 --> 26:28.602
and our planet, well,
you know, our world.

26:28.637 --> 26:31.071
Yeah, me too.

Has she always been this way?

27:24.893 --> 27:26.727
Not always.

27:26.761 --> 27:29.129
I think your parents
are leaving.

27:30.732 --> 27:33.967
Ok. Thanks...

27:34.002 --> 27:36.170
For dinner and everything.

27:45.080 --> 27:48.782
Well, I met a boy named moon,

27:48.817 --> 27:51.218
a girl named domino,
and a medicine man

27:51.252 --> 27:54.388
who says that the navajo
and scientists are
like blood brothers.

27:54.422 --> 27:58.392
Ah, the sign of a great party.

27:58.426 --> 28:00.594
Why don't you take him out
and show him a good time?

28:00.628 --> 28:01.628
Who?

28:01.663 --> 28:03.063
That new boy.

28:03.098 --> 28:05.165
His type doesn't stick around.

28:05.200 --> 28:07.434
Then I guess you don't
have much time.

28:08.937 --> 28:11.839
You can't tell anyone
about this place.

28:11.873 --> 28:12.873
I mean it.

28:12.907 --> 28:14.641
And I'm not kidding.

28:14.676 --> 28:16.977
Don't worry.
I don't know anyone.

28:17.011 --> 28:19.279
And I have no idea where I am.

28:19.314 --> 28:21.081
Just track the trees to water.

28:21.116 --> 28:22.983
If you see a pinyon or Juniper,

28:23.017 --> 28:24.852
you know there's no water.

29:01.723 --> 29:03.824
Whoo!

29:11.132 --> 29:13.667
Ha ha ha!

29:17.272 --> 29:18.672
You can do it!

29:18.706 --> 29:22.176
It's a risk management thing.

29:24.212 --> 29:25.512
What did she say?

29:25.547 --> 29:27.514
Lift your arms, open your heart,

29:27.549 --> 29:28.916
and jump.

29:32.954 --> 29:35.622
You know,
you don't have to do it
if you don't want to.

29:40.528 --> 29:43.063
Don't sweat it, bro.

29:49.971 --> 29:51.738
Whoo!

29:57.745 --> 29:58.946
Ha ha ha!

30:01.783 --> 30:04.084
Whoa!

30:04.118 --> 30:06.720
Whoa!

30:10.458 --> 30:13.393
Yeah!

30:13.428 --> 30:14.528
Yes!

30:26.074 --> 30:29.042
So why is this place
such a secret?

30:29.077 --> 30:31.211
'Cause way back when,

30:31.246 --> 30:33.313
boys came here
to learn how to be men.

30:33.348 --> 30:35.883
They learned how to hunt
and respect animals.

30:35.917 --> 30:36.917
Moon,

30:36.951 --> 30:39.286
your ancients were
probably vikings.

30:41.022 --> 30:43.490
So why do you care
so much about navajo?

30:45.426 --> 30:48.562
'Cause I like that
they had to go through stuff.

30:48.596 --> 30:50.264
The only thing we go
through is school.

30:50.298 --> 30:51.999
They had to go for days
without water

30:52.033 --> 30:55.969
and they'd suck on pebbles
just to survive.

30:57.205 --> 30:58.505
Did they have visions?

30:58.540 --> 31:00.874
No.

31:00.909 --> 31:03.844
I really want
to have a vision.
Of what?

31:03.878 --> 31:06.480
I don't know yet.
It has to come to me first.

31:06.514 --> 31:10.317
What you see is what there is.

31:10.351 --> 31:12.119
I don't believe in that stuff.

31:12.153 --> 31:13.854
I believe in everything.

31:13.888 --> 31:15.656
The navajo have
a lot of stories.

31:15.690 --> 31:17.691
Exactly.
Stories.

31:17.725 --> 31:21.762
Whenever they don't
understand something,
or why nature happens,

31:21.796 --> 31:25.732
they find an animal
or a story to explain it.

31:25.767 --> 31:28.235
You don't really care
about all this navajo
stuff, do you?

31:28.269 --> 31:30.037
No.

31:30.071 --> 31:32.406
Then why do you
get so mad at Kyle
and those guys?

31:33.775 --> 31:36.310
It's my job.

31:38.780 --> 31:41.982
Hsss!
You are fried chicken.

31:48.423 --> 31:50.157
It's an aloe leaf.

31:51.359 --> 31:53.560
I've never seen it
outside the bottle before.

32:13.381 --> 32:14.781
Hey.

32:14.816 --> 32:16.617
Hey, where have you been?

32:16.651 --> 32:19.920
Um, you know,
hiking up mountains,

32:19.954 --> 32:22.489
jumping off cliffs,
diving into waterfalls.

32:22.523 --> 32:23.523
The usual.

32:23.558 --> 32:25.892
Why are you all shiny?

32:25.927 --> 32:27.160
It's aloe for my sunburn.

32:27.195 --> 32:29.630
Who are you and what have
you done with my son?

32:33.001 --> 32:35.002
You know,
i really need a new bike.

32:35.069 --> 32:39.439
Shh, darling.
Don't ruin the moment.

32:56.824 --> 32:58.191
In the back.

32:58.226 --> 33:01.228
Thanks.

33:12.807 --> 33:16.510
I'm going to the...

33:16.544 --> 33:18.145
Red rocks.

33:18.179 --> 33:21.081
Yeah.

33:21.115 --> 33:23.150
Red rocks.

33:38.633 --> 33:40.934
Hey, you made it.

33:45.106 --> 33:46.673
Thanks for the ride.

33:46.708 --> 33:48.508
It isn't a restricted area,
is it?

33:48.543 --> 33:49.609
No.

33:49.644 --> 33:51.111
And it's not sacred?

33:51.145 --> 33:53.914
You're all right.
Be careful.

33:53.948 --> 33:55.115
Be smart.

33:55.149 --> 33:57.050
Ok.

33:57.085 --> 34:00.220
Boy: Whoo-hoo!

34:01.923 --> 34:03.156
Hmm.

34:09.197 --> 34:11.164
This course eats bikes, man.

34:11.199 --> 34:13.065
You sure you can race on that?

34:13.101 --> 34:14.835
Thanks for caring.

34:20.274 --> 34:21.408
Boy: Go!

34:21.442 --> 34:22.609
Second boy:
Look out!

34:22.643 --> 34:24.478
Hey, watch out!

34:29.183 --> 34:31.016
Boy: Whoa!

34:31.052 --> 34:32.219
Second boy: Yeah!

34:34.155 --> 34:35.522
Yeah!

34:40.360 --> 34:41.661
Boy: Stop!

34:43.664 --> 34:45.599
Whoo!

35:40.188 --> 35:41.721
Uhh!

35:45.259 --> 35:47.761
Ow.
That's gotta hurt.

35:50.164 --> 35:52.432
Boy: Pretty bike, man!

35:52.466 --> 35:53.667
Second boy: Eat my dust!

35:53.701 --> 35:55.402
Later!

35:57.605 --> 35:59.272
Ugh!

36:02.743 --> 36:05.478
Guess we'll never know
who's better.

36:05.513 --> 36:06.513
We'll find out.

36:06.547 --> 36:08.915
It's too hot to eat.

36:08.950 --> 36:09.983
Let's swim.

36:10.017 --> 36:11.257
Let's go to the community pool.

36:11.285 --> 36:12.485
No, there's too many locals.

36:12.520 --> 36:16.122
Strong start, dude.

36:16.157 --> 36:19.359
Too bad about the ol' blow out.

36:19.393 --> 36:23.363
Yeah, I bet
that thing handles great
on a paper route.

36:23.397 --> 36:24.297
I'm gone.

36:24.332 --> 36:26.633
Kids, don't try this at home.

36:26.667 --> 36:28.501
You know, that probably
wouldn't have happened

36:28.536 --> 36:29.870
if you would have had
a bike like mine.

36:29.904 --> 36:31.304
Yeah, it's really cool.

36:33.908 --> 36:35.575
Cheating death
one more time, right?

36:35.610 --> 36:39.946
Boy: Man, did you see the way
that loser crashed?

36:39.981 --> 36:41.081
Kyle: All right, later!

36:43.451 --> 36:45.452
I know a great place to swim.

36:45.486 --> 36:47.721
Oh, yeah?

36:56.998 --> 36:59.266
Whoo!

36:59.300 --> 37:01.935
Good.
Take a left.

37:03.971 --> 37:05.672
Kyle: Here we go.
Watch this.

37:05.706 --> 37:07.340
Timber!

37:07.375 --> 37:09.709
Nice!
Right on!

37:15.650 --> 37:17.017
Oh, yeah!

37:17.051 --> 37:20.120
Here we go!
Whoo-hoo!

37:20.154 --> 37:21.855
Boy: Oh, yes!

37:25.092 --> 37:27.460
It's this way.

37:27.495 --> 37:30.864
Hey, I think i hear it.

37:32.300 --> 37:36.369
Boy: Oh, man!
Ha ha ha!

37:36.404 --> 37:37.704
Whoops!

37:37.738 --> 37:38.738
Boy: Ha ha ha!

37:38.773 --> 37:39.806
Kyle: Whoo!

37:39.840 --> 37:42.108
It's good!

37:48.816 --> 37:51.017
Shock and awe.

38:01.662 --> 38:03.697
Whoo!

38:05.066 --> 38:07.734
Whoa!

38:07.768 --> 38:10.370
Yeah!
Ha ha ha!

38:15.576 --> 38:18.478
Come on, lady!
Jump!

38:18.512 --> 38:20.080
I've done it before.

38:20.114 --> 38:21.881
Yeah.
Right.

38:21.916 --> 38:24.617
Don't be weak!

38:30.524 --> 38:32.058
No!

38:35.863 --> 38:37.731
Oh, yeah!

38:37.765 --> 38:39.232
Yeah!

38:39.266 --> 38:40.800
Uhh!

38:44.338 --> 38:46.806
Whoo!
Yeah!

38:49.944 --> 38:52.445
You could have hurt me!

38:52.480 --> 38:54.547
It looked like you needed help.

38:54.582 --> 38:57.250
Yeah!
Whoo!

40:48.529 --> 40:50.063
Get out of here!
What are you doing?!

40:50.097 --> 40:51.798
Adding to the natural beauty.

40:51.832 --> 40:53.666
Stop!
This isn't your land!

40:53.701 --> 40:55.368
Says who?

40:55.402 --> 40:56.669
The navajo.

40:56.704 --> 40:58.872
Oh!
Give me a break.

40:58.906 --> 41:01.541
This is a sacred place.

41:01.575 --> 41:03.476
What are you, afraid of
a couple tortilla makers?

41:03.511 --> 41:06.946
No, I'm not afraid.
I'm just saying...

41:06.981 --> 41:08.314
Stop worrying so much.

41:10.618 --> 41:12.652
We gotta get out of here.
Right now, I mean it.

41:12.686 --> 41:14.387
Who made you chief?

41:33.090 --> 41:34.457
Hey, hey, hey.
Let him sleep.

41:34.492 --> 41:36.259
But I thought
he had to go to work.

41:36.293 --> 41:38.728
He said he wasn't feeling well.

41:38.762 --> 41:39.896
Come on.

41:39.930 --> 41:41.431
All right.

41:54.178 --> 41:56.880
He's not coming.

41:56.914 --> 41:58.314
The guy's a tourist.

41:58.349 --> 41:59.949
Ha ha!

42:01.919 --> 42:05.488
It's way too hot.
I want to be done now.

42:06.657 --> 42:08.224
We have to fix a fence
in the north corner

42:08.259 --> 42:10.326
where the dirt heads
rode over it.

42:10.361 --> 42:12.695
And then, let's go for a swim.

42:12.730 --> 42:14.097
All right.

42:24.675 --> 42:26.609
Moon: This is wrong, man.

42:36.620 --> 42:40.123
All the places in the world,
and he brings them here.

42:40.157 --> 42:41.057
Who?

42:41.091 --> 42:43.259
Josh.
Who do you think?

42:43.294 --> 42:45.595
You don't know it was him.

42:45.629 --> 42:47.630
Well, who else would it be?

42:48.933 --> 42:51.601
Spirits of the 4 winds make
the buffalo trample

42:51.635 --> 42:53.803
their bikes and trucks.

42:53.837 --> 42:57.507
Let the wild animals stomp them
into road kill... wait!

42:57.541 --> 42:59.676
Don't ask the spirits for that.

42:59.710 --> 43:01.244
Thomas: No.

43:01.278 --> 43:03.479
Ask "where's Josh?"

43:12.189 --> 43:15.658
You haven't eaten
anything all day.

43:15.693 --> 43:17.560
I'm not hungry.

43:17.595 --> 43:20.897
You look hungry.

43:20.931 --> 43:24.033
Taste my corn chipotle popovers.

43:24.068 --> 43:26.336
Corn is the symbol
of life, you know.

43:26.370 --> 43:27.770
Stop.

43:27.805 --> 43:30.073
Josh, there's someone here
to see you.

43:33.277 --> 43:34.978
What's up?

43:35.012 --> 43:36.879
You know.

43:36.914 --> 43:39.716
You and your friends
trashed shining steps.

43:39.750 --> 43:41.351
It wasn't me.

43:41.385 --> 43:43.119
Then how'd those guys
know about it?

43:43.153 --> 43:44.654
They tagged the place!

43:44.688 --> 43:46.356
I didn't tag anything.

43:46.390 --> 43:48.324
But you were there.

43:48.359 --> 43:51.394
I tried to stop them.
You know what they're like.

43:51.428 --> 43:53.229
They didn't even listen to me.

43:53.263 --> 43:55.198
That is so weak.

43:55.232 --> 43:56.799
But it's true.

43:56.834 --> 43:59.435
We told you not to tell
anyone about the place,

43:59.470 --> 44:01.437
and then you show those jerks?

44:01.472 --> 44:05.675
I'm telling you,
i tried to stop them.

44:05.709 --> 44:08.144
I assure you,
this will be taken care of.

44:08.178 --> 44:10.747
Immediately.
We are very sorry.

44:10.781 --> 44:11.881
Hmm.

44:13.751 --> 44:18.321
The boys need to find
a balance with nature

44:18.355 --> 44:20.256
to live in <i> hojo.</i>

44:20.290 --> 44:22.191
What's that?

44:22.226 --> 44:23.893
You don't even want to know.

44:25.896 --> 44:27.263
Thank you.

44:36.974 --> 44:38.174
John: There comes a time

44:38.208 --> 44:40.176
when you must go
into the wilderness alone

44:40.210 --> 44:45.148
to discover your true nature.

44:45.182 --> 44:46.215
The time spent alone

44:46.250 --> 44:48.084
will help you find your ground

44:48.118 --> 44:50.687
and determine your place
in the world.

44:50.721 --> 44:52.588
Dim sum.

44:52.623 --> 44:53.790
Embrace the dreams

44:53.824 --> 44:56.025
and the animals
that may visit you.

44:56.060 --> 45:00.963
They will reveal
your strengths, wounds,
and life's purpose.

45:02.266 --> 45:04.834
Josh: Bye, mom.

45:04.868 --> 45:06.002
Bye, dad.

45:06.036 --> 45:07.470
Bye-bye, baby.

45:07.504 --> 45:09.739
See you tomorrow.

45:09.773 --> 45:10.873
Josh: Bye.

45:12.876 --> 45:13.843
I'm leaving now.

45:13.877 --> 45:15.645
Mm.

45:15.679 --> 45:17.313
Ok.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.120
Let him go.

45:27.291 --> 45:30.493
The navajo belief is based
on a harmonious relationship

45:30.527 --> 45:32.895
between our people
and mother earth.

45:32.930 --> 45:35.031
When you're out of balance,
you feel it.

45:38.469 --> 45:41.337
Been a lot of storms lately.

45:41.371 --> 45:42.672
Right.
Right.

45:42.706 --> 45:44.006
Hmm.

45:44.041 --> 45:45.374
You must be clear in your heart

45:45.409 --> 45:47.643
as to what you seek
for yourself,

45:47.678 --> 45:49.479
for your people,

45:49.513 --> 45:51.814
for the people of the world.

45:51.849 --> 45:53.616
Sunrise is a time to pray.

45:53.650 --> 45:56.352
Sunrise is a time to sleep.

45:56.386 --> 45:58.588
It's a good thing you're going.

46:27.718 --> 46:30.887
It's a long time.
I'm gonna need that stuff.

46:30.921 --> 46:33.489
If my blood sugar drops,
i get dizzy.

46:33.524 --> 46:36.759
I get cold and hungry and tired.

46:37.861 --> 46:39.595
You can't take dim sum.

46:52.242 --> 46:54.977
Look after one another.

47:20.704 --> 47:21.838
John: Go to a place

47:21.872 --> 47:24.540
where you can bring forth
what you are

47:24.575 --> 47:26.876
and the way you might be.

47:28.612 --> 47:31.247
Is that a cave up there?

47:31.281 --> 47:34.584
No. It's a hole
in the rock.

47:34.618 --> 47:36.652
Just like home.

47:36.687 --> 47:39.388
We have geological formations,
too, you know.

47:39.423 --> 47:41.390
Ancient sublevel parking lots

47:41.425 --> 47:44.393
and subways
with great acoustics.

47:47.464 --> 47:49.465
You must've climbed up
those a million times, huh?

47:49.499 --> 47:50.900
Not a million.

47:50.934 --> 47:56.038
Well, not a million,
but I mean a lot.

47:56.073 --> 47:57.974
Isn't it a part
of your culture
and stuff?

47:58.008 --> 47:59.408
No.

47:59.443 --> 48:01.210
No what?

48:01.278 --> 48:03.446
No, I didn't come here a lot.

48:03.480 --> 48:06.182
I don't sit around caves
passing peace pipes.

48:09.786 --> 48:12.154
So what is <i> hojo?</i>

48:12.189 --> 48:13.489
Like a vision quest?

48:13.523 --> 48:16.292
Navajo don't do vision quests.

48:16.326 --> 48:19.028
I'm gonna go cool off.

48:33.644 --> 48:35.411
He didn't find my candy bars.

48:35.445 --> 48:37.313
If he didn't want you
to have them,

48:37.347 --> 48:39.582
you wouldn't find them
in your bag.

48:43.220 --> 48:44.186
No.

48:44.221 --> 48:45.955
Go for it.

48:51.728 --> 48:55.031
So this looks like
a good camp site, right?

48:57.401 --> 48:58.634
Look at the tracks.

48:58.669 --> 49:02.271
Animals come here
at night to water.

49:02.306 --> 49:04.640
What kind of animals
are we talking about?

49:04.675 --> 49:05.942
Quail.

49:05.976 --> 49:07.977
They're small.
I could take one
if I had to.

49:08.011 --> 49:09.011
Deer.

49:09.046 --> 49:11.414
They're shy and
they stay away from people.

49:11.448 --> 49:13.282
A bobcat and a cougar?

49:13.317 --> 49:14.884
That's harsh.

49:18.789 --> 49:20.823
Doesn't look like rain.

49:22.192 --> 49:23.993
Does it?

49:26.096 --> 49:27.830
Where are you going?

49:27.864 --> 49:28.965
Up river.

49:28.999 --> 49:31.500
I'm coming with you.

49:31.535 --> 49:32.668
That's your problem.

49:32.703 --> 49:34.603
Stop being a follower.

49:34.638 --> 49:36.706
I'm not a follower.

49:36.740 --> 49:37.773
Yeah, right.

49:37.808 --> 49:40.076
You led those guys
to shining steps.

49:40.110 --> 49:41.544
I said I was sorry.

49:41.578 --> 49:43.646
It doesn't mean anything
if you don't understand

49:43.680 --> 49:45.982
what you did was messed up.

49:46.016 --> 49:47.750
What was i supposed to do?

49:47.784 --> 49:50.886
You're supposed
to stick up for us.

49:50.921 --> 49:52.455
And say what?
Leave, please?

49:52.489 --> 49:54.056
Something like that.

49:54.091 --> 49:57.059
I'm sorry i couldn't stop them.

49:59.029 --> 50:00.196
We trusted you,

50:00.230 --> 50:01.330
and you didn't keep our secret

50:01.365 --> 50:02.765
because you think
it's more important

50:02.799 --> 50:04.233
to hang out with those guys.

50:04.267 --> 50:06.736
I don't know why.
They're jerks.

50:09.306 --> 50:10.539
I said I was sorry.

50:10.574 --> 50:13.609
I'm going up river.
You go down.

50:13.643 --> 50:15.277
We'll meet back here
tomorrow morning at 9:00.

50:15.312 --> 50:17.646
If you're not here, I'm leaving.

50:17.681 --> 50:19.548
You just be here.

50:19.583 --> 50:22.051
Yeah.

50:35.232 --> 50:37.533
John: Be aware of things
within you.

50:37.567 --> 50:41.604
Your anger and your fear
can help you.

51:32.022 --> 51:34.156
Ugh! Ugh!

51:42.766 --> 51:45.367
Rice.
Beans.

51:49.206 --> 51:50.573
Pan.

51:53.877 --> 51:56.011
John: Make a circle
around you

51:56.046 --> 52:00.249
to connect you with all things.

52:04.488 --> 52:07.256
Come on.
Come on.

52:11.161 --> 52:13.429
Come on.

52:55.539 --> 52:57.806
John: The day will come
when people will ask us

52:57.841 --> 53:01.911
to teach them
how to care for the earth.

53:01.945 --> 53:03.913
When that day comes,

53:03.947 --> 53:05.948
we will be ready.

53:20.964 --> 53:24.500
Thomas blackhorse,
you cannot leave.

53:24.534 --> 53:26.235
Our people are hungry.

53:26.269 --> 53:29.104
You must bring the herd
back to our people,

53:29.139 --> 53:32.441
and you will bring
to our people health.

53:32.475 --> 53:35.177
Sorry.
Not my problem.

53:35.212 --> 53:36.645
But it is!

53:36.680 --> 53:38.314
No matter where you travel,

53:38.348 --> 53:40.749
this land is part of you.

53:40.784 --> 53:43.919
It made you who you are

53:43.954 --> 53:46.155
and who you will become.

53:46.189 --> 53:49.858
You must go or...

53:49.893 --> 53:52.328
Or what?

54:05.108 --> 54:06.675
You talk to him.

54:08.345 --> 54:10.346
You can do it, you know.

54:15.485 --> 54:18.954
Why are you out here all alone?

54:22.859 --> 54:25.961
You will never be forgotten.

54:25.996 --> 54:28.097
We will help each other.

54:50.687 --> 54:52.588
Can I have fries with that?

54:55.258 --> 54:57.393
Do you deliver?

55:16.713 --> 55:17.880
Thanks.

55:17.914 --> 55:20.249
Ok. That's it.

55:20.283 --> 55:22.184
This place is way
too whack for me.

55:22.218 --> 55:23.419
I gotta go home.

55:32.295 --> 55:33.696
I... I'm from the city.

55:33.730 --> 55:35.164
I take trains.

55:35.198 --> 55:38.067
I can't fly
without 2 engines
and a fuselage.

55:38.101 --> 55:40.636
You never tried.
We all have bird in us.

55:40.670 --> 55:42.504
Obviously,
some more than others.

55:42.539 --> 55:46.208
What kind of bird spirit
are you going to be?

55:46.242 --> 55:48.410
Ok.

55:48.445 --> 55:50.546
Well...

55:50.580 --> 55:51.513
What are my choices?

55:51.548 --> 55:54.216
Ravens, blue jays, crows.

55:54.250 --> 55:56.118
My family, the hawks.

55:56.152 --> 55:58.520
Mighty, fierce,
and very good-looking.

55:58.555 --> 56:01.190
And there is eagle,
mighty messenger

56:01.224 --> 56:03.859
between up there and down there,

56:03.893 --> 56:05.227
a true leader.

56:05.261 --> 56:08.664
So, what bird spirit are you?

56:08.698 --> 56:11.200
Get back to me
when you find out.

56:49.005 --> 56:51.373
Nothing broken?

56:51.408 --> 56:53.509
The eagle has landed.

57:15.865 --> 57:18.333
Thomas!

57:18.368 --> 57:19.501
Josh!

57:48.097 --> 57:51.066
The wind's bringing
in the storm!

57:51.100 --> 57:52.468
We can make it to the cave!

57:52.502 --> 57:54.503
That's where i's going!

58:00.710 --> 58:03.779
For such an empty place,
it sure is busy.

58:04.981 --> 58:08.951
People really eat that stuff?

58:08.985 --> 58:10.452
It comes in handy.

58:11.354 --> 58:12.988
Here.

58:16.259 --> 58:17.993
If you get a toothache,

58:18.027 --> 58:20.462
chew on an echinacea root.

58:20.497 --> 58:22.364
Ok.

58:22.398 --> 58:26.969
My grandfather has
a remedy for everything.

58:27.003 --> 58:28.203
I had the weirdest dream.

58:28.238 --> 58:29.872
About what?

58:29.906 --> 58:33.008
This talking bird.

58:33.042 --> 58:34.576
And then I flew,

58:34.611 --> 58:36.411
like I was an eagle
or something.

58:36.446 --> 58:38.013
In your dreams.

58:38.047 --> 58:40.182
The navajo love the eagles.

58:40.216 --> 58:42.084
They believe they carry
their hope and dreams

58:42.118 --> 58:43.719
to the spirits.

58:43.753 --> 58:45.487
Cool.

58:46.589 --> 58:48.557
I dreamt about buffalo.

58:48.591 --> 58:49.958
You gotta get out more.

58:49.993 --> 58:52.027
They're invading your brain.

58:52.061 --> 58:54.796
I was a hunter.

58:54.831 --> 58:57.933
It felt so real,
i could feel
the earth shake.

58:57.967 --> 58:59.067
That was the thunder.

58:59.102 --> 59:00.836
Leaked into your dream.

59:00.870 --> 59:02.337
Scout was there.

59:02.372 --> 59:04.206
Ok.

59:04.240 --> 59:06.775
Well, we know the buffalo's
a native thing.

59:08.611 --> 59:09.878
Yeah...

59:09.913 --> 59:12.014
But I'm tired of being navajo.

59:13.016 --> 59:15.651
I wanna be from Brooklyn...

59:15.685 --> 59:17.219
Or Graceland.

59:17.253 --> 59:18.820
Go for it.

59:18.855 --> 59:21.990
Ah, I couldn't leave scout...

59:22.025 --> 59:24.459
Or my grandparents.

59:26.529 --> 59:28.797
My parents left here.

59:28.831 --> 59:30.532
Where'd they go?

59:31.968 --> 59:33.802
They died in a car crash

59:33.836 --> 59:36.204
on their way to Seattle.

59:39.342 --> 59:41.476
I'm sorry.

59:42.845 --> 59:44.813
That's gotta be rough on you.

59:46.716 --> 59:47.783
Yeah.

59:47.817 --> 59:51.086
Been tougher on scout.

59:51.120 --> 59:53.655
That's when she stopped talking.

59:55.325 --> 59:58.660
She hasn't spoken a word since.

59:58.695 --> 59:59.962
What did the doctor say?

01:00:02.231 --> 01:00:03.632
Nothing.

01:00:05.501 --> 01:00:07.369
What a whacked place.

01:00:19.732 --> 01:00:22.367
Dr. townsend: It was
only one night.

01:00:29.409 --> 01:00:32.878
Boys: Whoo!

01:00:32.912 --> 01:00:34.479
Hey, hey, hey!

01:00:34.514 --> 01:00:36.615
Joshie!

01:00:37.717 --> 01:00:39.084
There he is.

01:00:39.118 --> 01:00:41.653
Man, are we glad to see you.

01:00:41.688 --> 01:00:43.188
We were just trying to remember

01:00:43.222 --> 01:00:45.390
where those waterfalls were.

01:00:45.425 --> 01:00:47.426
You guys gotta go clean up
the mess you made.

01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:49.261
No, man, we wanna swim.

01:00:49.295 --> 01:00:50.629
No way.

01:00:50.663 --> 01:00:52.597
Shunting steps
is private property.

01:00:53.533 --> 01:00:54.733
Get over it.

01:00:54.767 --> 01:00:55.767
I'd rather settle it.

01:00:55.802 --> 01:00:58.236
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

01:00:58.271 --> 01:01:00.539
Me and you.
One on one.

01:01:00.573 --> 01:01:02.040
We race.

01:01:02.075 --> 01:01:03.442
Deal.

01:01:03.476 --> 01:01:06.345
I win, we get to ride
where we want,
when we want,

01:01:06.379 --> 01:01:08.413
and you and your tribe back off.

01:01:08.448 --> 01:01:09.648
Won't happen.

01:01:09.682 --> 01:01:11.950
I win, and you guys get lost.

01:01:11.985 --> 01:01:13.285
Turquoise mountain ski resort,

01:01:13.319 --> 01:01:14.319
next Saturday.

01:01:14.354 --> 01:01:16.188
Up and down.
Up and down.

01:01:16.222 --> 01:01:17.956
I'm there.
Guys?

01:01:17.991 --> 01:01:19.358
We gotta push it back a week.

01:01:19.392 --> 01:01:22.260
Wha...
I'm getting
my braces off.

01:01:23.496 --> 01:01:26.298
Fine.
Devil's revenge.

01:01:26.332 --> 01:01:27.299
The trail.

01:01:27.333 --> 01:01:29.468
Bring it on.

01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:02.868
I'm not too early, am I?

01:02:02.902 --> 01:02:04.770
Maybe a little.

01:02:08.107 --> 01:02:10.042
Thomas says you have
a remedy for everything.

01:02:10.977 --> 01:02:12.310
Yeah, pretty much.

01:02:12.345 --> 01:02:15.414
Well, I was wondering
if you had any Indian...

01:02:15.448 --> 01:02:17.916
I mean, navajo herbs
and medicines

01:02:17.950 --> 01:02:21.653
to, uh, you know,
get me into shape.

01:02:21.687 --> 01:02:22.988
Oh.

01:02:23.890 --> 01:02:26.425
Come on.

01:02:26.459 --> 01:02:28.326
What kind of shape
you wanna be in?

01:02:32.231 --> 01:02:33.765
I knew this lakota warrior

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:36.902
who shape-shifted
into a cougar.

01:02:36.936 --> 01:02:39.004
I... i just wanna be ready
for a cross-country,

01:02:39.038 --> 01:02:40.505
downhill mountain bike race.

01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:42.407
Oh.

01:02:42.442 --> 01:02:45.544
You have a good
and true reason
for doing this?

01:02:45.578 --> 01:02:46.812
Uh-huh.

01:02:46.846 --> 01:02:48.246
Huh.

01:02:48.281 --> 01:02:50.982
So, when is this race
gonna take place?

01:02:51.017 --> 01:02:53.318
2 weeks.

01:02:53.352 --> 01:02:55.954
You eaten anything today?

01:02:55.988 --> 01:02:57.322
No.

01:02:59.425 --> 01:03:01.259
Then don't.

01:03:30.256 --> 01:03:32.023
Smells like photosynthesis.

01:03:32.058 --> 01:03:34.493
Good for stamina,
muscles, and joints.

01:03:34.527 --> 01:03:38.830
Bloodletting
and leeching were popular,
too, you know.

01:03:38.865 --> 01:03:40.332
Hmm.

01:03:40.366 --> 01:03:42.434
This is even older, mom.

01:04:01.354 --> 01:04:03.121
Ahem.

01:04:05.558 --> 01:04:07.859
Scout's just wondering
why you're trying
to get all buff.

01:04:07.894 --> 01:04:09.561
No, I'm not.

01:04:09.595 --> 01:04:11.830
No one ever lies to scout.

01:04:21.674 --> 01:04:24.075
I challenged Kyle to a race.

01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:25.777
I win, and they're
out of here
for good.

01:04:25.811 --> 01:04:27.879
Who are you to take this on?

01:04:27.914 --> 01:04:30.015
That's not
a bad question.
I mean...

01:04:30.049 --> 01:04:31.116
And what if you don't win?

01:04:31.150 --> 01:04:32.417
I'll win.

01:04:32.451 --> 01:04:34.753
This is definitely
not a good idea.

01:04:34.787 --> 01:04:36.421
Yes, it is.

01:04:36.455 --> 01:04:38.456
Thomas, you've said it yourself.

01:04:38.491 --> 01:04:40.959
I didn't understand
at the time
how important it is

01:04:40.993 --> 01:04:43.662
to do something
bigger than yourself
for others,

01:04:43.696 --> 01:04:45.830
and it's the only thing
these guys accept.

01:04:45.865 --> 01:04:47.132
I'll race them.

01:04:47.166 --> 01:04:48.466
No offense.

01:04:48.501 --> 01:04:50.368
You're a tourist around here.

01:04:50.403 --> 01:04:51.469
Thomas is right,

01:04:51.504 --> 01:04:53.838
but he should
totally defend the...

01:04:53.873 --> 01:04:55.440
Moon!

01:04:59.312 --> 01:05:01.279
Where is the race?

01:05:01.314 --> 01:05:03.615
Devil's revenge.

01:05:03.649 --> 01:05:05.450
You guys know it?

01:05:06.686 --> 01:05:07.886
Josh: Whoa.

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:10.222
Think i should race.

01:05:11.991 --> 01:05:13.491
I can do this.

01:05:13.526 --> 01:05:16.561
Dude, this is nasty work.

01:05:16.596 --> 01:05:18.463
And, well,

01:05:18.497 --> 01:05:19.898
your bike is kind of weak.

01:05:19.932 --> 01:05:22.634
I can fix it up fine.

01:05:23.769 --> 01:05:25.070
I'll race Kyle.

01:05:25.104 --> 01:05:26.371
I know the terrain.

01:05:26.405 --> 01:05:28.173
I have to race for me

01:05:28.207 --> 01:05:30.008
and for you and for scout

01:05:30.042 --> 01:05:32.544
and for my mistakes.

01:05:32.578 --> 01:05:34.446
Otherwise, what am i doing here?

01:05:38.985 --> 01:05:41.386
Scout thinks you should race.

01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:43.588
You know what's at stake here?

01:05:43.623 --> 01:05:45.790
He's never done this course.

01:05:45.825 --> 01:05:48.260
Kyle will be all over him.

01:05:59.071 --> 01:06:01.473
Thomas:
You'll need this
for good fortune.

01:06:01.507 --> 01:06:04.576
Turquoise heals and attracts

01:06:04.610 --> 01:06:06.278
good friends.

01:06:07.446 --> 01:06:09.714
Just, uh,

01:06:09.749 --> 01:06:12.017
don't start shaving
your legs or anything.

01:06:47.186 --> 01:06:48.353
10!

01:06:52.224 --> 01:06:54.059
20!

01:07:00.766 --> 01:07:02.167
30!

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:10.141
Mmm. That smells so good.

01:07:10.176 --> 01:07:12.911
You're gonna have to
give me the recipe.

01:07:33.032 --> 01:07:35.033
How's it goin'?

01:07:35.067 --> 01:07:36.368
Going well.

01:07:36.402 --> 01:07:38.336
Give it up, dude.

01:07:38.371 --> 01:07:39.304
No.

01:07:39.338 --> 01:07:41.306
Nobody wants a turf war.

01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:42.974
Then beat it.

01:07:43.008 --> 01:07:44.542
Let it go, dude.
You don't have the chops

01:07:44.577 --> 01:07:46.711
or the bike to beat Kyle.

01:07:46.746 --> 01:07:47.912
Yeah, I do.

01:07:59.658 --> 01:08:01.693
What was that, Kyle?

01:08:28.319 --> 01:08:30.455
Hi, Thomas.
Is Josh with you?

01:08:31.991 --> 01:08:34.959
No. He hasn't been
with us all day.

01:08:34.993 --> 01:08:37.395
Hey.

01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:40.432
Have you heard from Josh?

01:08:40.466 --> 01:08:42.300
No. Sorry, Mrs. t.

01:08:42.334 --> 01:08:43.768
Ok, thanks.

01:08:59.084 --> 01:09:01.085
Hello, this is Blaine townsend,

01:09:01.153 --> 01:09:03.020
and I was wondering
if you could help me.

01:09:03.055 --> 01:09:06.090
We interrupt our normally
scheduled programming

01:09:06.125 --> 01:09:09.093
to broadcast a special alert.

01:09:09.127 --> 01:09:11.229
We're looking for Josh townsend,

01:09:11.263 --> 01:09:14.732
5'6", brown hair,

01:09:14.767 --> 01:09:18.703
probably soaking wet by now.

01:09:18.737 --> 01:09:20.004
Plug in, Josh.

01:09:20.038 --> 01:09:21.773
Your mom's looking for you.

01:09:28.046 --> 01:09:29.848
Thomas.

01:09:33.352 --> 01:09:34.586
Hello?

01:09:35.488 --> 01:09:36.888
We're looking for Josh.

01:09:36.921 --> 01:09:39.491
Do you have any idea
where he might be?

01:09:39.524 --> 01:09:42.126
He's been riding
the train tracks lately.

01:09:42.161 --> 01:09:44.895
Don't worry. Trains
don't travel there anymore.

01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:47.465
Well, how... how far out
is that place?

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:49.033
Try the north end of the res,

01:09:49.068 --> 01:09:51.002
and I'll try the arroyo.

01:09:51.036 --> 01:09:52.337
Ok.

01:09:52.371 --> 01:09:53.837
Bye.

01:09:53.872 --> 01:09:55.206
Let's go.

01:10:17.997 --> 01:10:20.532
I... i couldn't get home.

01:10:20.566 --> 01:10:23.067
My bike's out there somewhere.

01:10:23.102 --> 01:10:25.236
Never mind.
Thanks for the ride.

01:10:26.839 --> 01:10:28.339
Pull up your seat belts.

01:10:39.785 --> 01:10:41.085
We can't thank you enough.

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:43.655
Thank you for all your help.

01:10:43.689 --> 01:10:45.490
Well, his bruises will heal,

01:10:45.524 --> 01:10:48.993
but it's his spirit
that needs herba del lobo
extract.

01:10:49.028 --> 01:10:50.828
I'll make sure he gets some.

01:10:50.863 --> 01:10:53.231
We've got
a medical doctor
on the way. Thanks.

01:10:53.265 --> 01:10:55.300
We're covering all of our bases.

01:10:55.334 --> 01:10:57.201
I'm just saying...

01:11:04.476 --> 01:11:06.544
See ya.
Thank you.

01:11:12.384 --> 01:11:14.285
Would you step outside?

01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:17.855
His bruises are going
to heal just fine,

01:11:17.890 --> 01:11:21.593
but has he been
under any kind of pressure

01:11:21.627 --> 01:11:23.761
or stress lately?

01:11:24.797 --> 01:11:26.464
Well, he's still asleep.

01:11:26.498 --> 01:11:28.433
But I can't say it's peaceful.

01:11:28.467 --> 01:11:32.136
He just seems so restless.

01:11:32.171 --> 01:11:35.039
What's he doing
riding his bicycle
in the middle of a storm?

01:11:35.074 --> 01:11:36.808
And why is my son out there

01:11:36.842 --> 01:11:38.543
in the middle of nowhere
riding around?

01:11:38.577 --> 01:11:39.844
What was he thinking?

01:11:39.878 --> 01:11:43.147
He was training
for a competition.

01:11:43.182 --> 01:11:45.583
What?

01:11:45.618 --> 01:11:47.118
Since when does he compete?

01:11:47.152 --> 01:11:49.687
Is there something
i don't know about?

01:11:50.789 --> 01:11:52.190
Thomas?

01:11:52.224 --> 01:11:54.092
He was gonna race
against this kid

01:11:54.126 --> 01:11:58.529
whose gang keeps on
tearing up navajo places
and...

01:11:58.564 --> 01:12:01.432
Josh challenged him
so they'd finally
leave us alone.

01:12:02.568 --> 01:12:04.369
He's a really strong rider.

01:12:35.801 --> 01:12:36.801
Ah-choo!

01:12:39.471 --> 01:12:40.605
Ah-choo!

01:12:40.639 --> 01:12:43.975
All right, step outside
and get some air,
please?

01:12:44.009 --> 01:12:45.843
I'll tell you
if something
changes, ok?

01:12:45.878 --> 01:12:48.079
Ok. Ah-choo!

01:12:54.987 --> 01:12:56.854
Girl, on radio:
All of us here at ktqt

01:12:56.889 --> 01:12:59.824
are wishing Josh townsend
a speedy recovery.

01:12:59.858 --> 01:13:01.192
We're sending over white light

01:13:01.226 --> 01:13:04.696
and a couple of pizzas,
so get better, dude.

01:13:10.436 --> 01:13:11.669
Huh.

01:13:55.647 --> 01:13:57.281
You're looking for something,

01:13:57.316 --> 01:13:59.650
but you don't know what.

01:13:59.685 --> 01:14:01.452
Mmm, no.
No, I'm not.

01:14:01.487 --> 01:14:03.354
Yes, you are.

01:14:03.388 --> 01:14:05.490
I'm just, uh,

01:14:05.524 --> 01:14:06.858
a little lost.

01:14:06.892 --> 01:14:08.793
No, you're not.

01:14:08.827 --> 01:14:10.795
Yes, I am.

01:14:10.829 --> 01:14:12.530
I'm, uh,

01:14:12.564 --> 01:14:15.199
ahem, trying to get
something for my son.

01:14:15.234 --> 01:14:16.434
Get him a bike.

01:14:20.439 --> 01:14:21.639
Excuse me?

01:14:21.673 --> 01:14:22.774
A bicycle.

01:14:22.808 --> 01:14:25.743
Uh, that's a... that's
a brilliant idea,

01:14:25.778 --> 01:14:27.211
but how did you know that?

01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:32.416
I'm sorry. I'm...
I'm a scientist. Uh...

01:14:32.451 --> 01:14:34.685
I measure, calculate.

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:36.387
Things are pretty much
absolute for me,

01:14:36.421 --> 01:14:37.889
and i...

01:14:37.923 --> 01:14:40.925
I don't... i don't
understand you people.

01:14:40.959 --> 01:14:43.060
There's one in the back.

01:14:43.095 --> 01:14:44.762
One... one what?

01:14:44.797 --> 01:14:47.932
One bicycle.
I can let you
have it real cheap.

01:15:05.818 --> 01:15:07.251
Mmm...

01:15:08.987 --> 01:15:10.922
Tight.

01:15:14.259 --> 01:15:16.227
You're awake.

01:15:16.261 --> 01:15:17.628
How are you feeling?

01:15:17.663 --> 01:15:20.164
You have been asleep for 2 days!

01:15:20.199 --> 01:15:21.699
Ohh!

01:15:21.733 --> 01:15:23.000
Hey.

01:15:24.002 --> 01:15:26.537
Ok, let me check your wounds.

01:15:26.572 --> 01:15:28.873
Oh, these are healing nicely.

01:15:28.907 --> 01:15:30.508
I knew that alehoof would work.

01:15:30.542 --> 01:15:32.210
Good morning.

01:15:34.746 --> 01:15:36.514
Awesome bike, dad.

01:15:36.548 --> 01:15:40.051
Well, apparently,
you need one for a race.

01:15:43.522 --> 01:15:44.789
I don't know.

01:15:46.024 --> 01:15:47.291
I do.

01:15:52.497 --> 01:15:53.965
Ok, now, remember,

01:15:53.999 --> 01:15:55.266
distance is a product

01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:56.801
of velocity and trajectory,

01:15:56.835 --> 01:15:58.135
but only up to a certain angle.

01:15:58.170 --> 01:15:59.537
After that, you're just
gonna get the height

01:15:59.571 --> 01:16:00.805
but not the distance.

01:16:00.839 --> 01:16:02.473
So don't go too high.

01:16:02.507 --> 01:16:03.841
That's my boy.
Good.

01:16:03.876 --> 01:16:05.343
Pound it.

01:16:13.886 --> 01:16:16.387
Right over here.
I wanna get
a straight shot of Josh.

01:16:21.593 --> 01:16:23.694
What's goin' on, Dr. t?
Rock on, moon!

01:16:23.729 --> 01:16:24.896
Abuela, John.

01:16:24.930 --> 01:16:26.664
What's up there, moon?

01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:31.269
Are you sure you're
feeling all right?

01:16:31.303 --> 01:16:32.937
I feel fine.

01:16:32.971 --> 01:16:34.171
Are you sure?

01:16:34.206 --> 01:16:35.506
Yeah. Stop asking me.

01:16:36.742 --> 01:16:39.377
Now, remember,
after the second
hairpin turn...

01:16:39.411 --> 01:16:41.379
I know! Stop telling me
that. It drops out.

01:16:41.413 --> 01:16:44.916
I was gonna say
that's when you
start praying, but...

01:16:47.419 --> 01:16:49.820
All right. You guys climb
the fire roads to summit,

01:16:49.855 --> 01:16:52.757
then pick up mine field
back down to devil's revenge.

01:16:52.791 --> 01:16:54.926
First one back here wins.

01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:56.527
You guys ready?

01:16:56.561 --> 01:16:58.596
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:16:58.630 --> 01:17:00.498
Thomas: Shake hands.

01:17:03.235 --> 01:17:05.703
See you soon.

01:17:05.737 --> 01:17:06.871
See you.

01:17:06.905 --> 01:17:09.240
Play nice, and I'll let
you ride on my land.

01:17:09.274 --> 01:17:11.842
Don't worry. We'll find you
some nice trails in Nevada.

01:17:11.877 --> 01:17:13.411
Baby.

01:17:13.445 --> 01:17:15.079
It's starting.

01:17:28.827 --> 01:17:30.494
Who's gonna call it?

01:17:33.131 --> 01:17:34.765
Him.

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.434
Man: Come on,
moon.

01:17:36.468 --> 01:17:38.402
Moon, can you get it
started here?

01:17:39.471 --> 01:17:41.138
Woman:
We're counting on you.

01:17:41.173 --> 01:17:42.807
You can do it, Josh.

01:17:42.841 --> 01:17:44.075
Racers...

01:17:44.109 --> 01:17:45.810
Mount your bikes!

01:17:45.844 --> 01:17:48.079
Already did.

01:17:48.113 --> 01:17:49.747
Can you just raise
and lower your arm, please?

01:17:49.781 --> 01:17:51.749
Got it.

01:17:53.018 --> 01:17:54.285
Ready...

01:17:54.319 --> 01:17:56.687
Set...

01:17:56.722 --> 01:17:57.755
Go!

01:17:57.789 --> 01:18:00.758
Yes! Go! Go,
go, go, Josh!

01:18:00.792 --> 01:18:02.126
Let's go!

01:18:05.564 --> 01:18:07.031
Whoa!

01:18:07.065 --> 01:18:08.733
Ohh!
Oh, come on!

01:18:13.805 --> 01:18:15.673
They're going up now.

01:18:15.707 --> 01:18:17.942
Sources say the heat is on.

01:18:17.976 --> 01:18:19.944
Kyle and Josh are
on a stairway to heaven.

01:18:19.978 --> 01:18:21.612
That's the turquoise ascent,
folks,

01:18:21.646 --> 01:18:24.548
2,000 vertical feet
of leg-burning,

01:18:24.583 --> 01:18:26.884
lung-busting heartbreak.

01:18:30.689 --> 01:18:32.256
Watch up there.

01:18:49.608 --> 01:18:52.076
Go, baby, go, baby, go!

01:18:52.110 --> 01:18:54.211
Oh, yeah!

01:18:55.914 --> 01:18:57.348
Yeah, go!

01:19:04.523 --> 01:19:06.857
Woman: Oh, man.

01:19:40.092 --> 01:19:41.759
Buffalo.

01:19:41.793 --> 01:19:43.961
They're off the preserve.

01:19:43.995 --> 01:19:46.330
Ride!
Right behind you!

01:19:46.364 --> 01:19:47.631
They're at the top!

01:19:50.735 --> 01:19:51.669
Find it!

01:19:51.703 --> 01:19:53.137
Find it.

01:19:56.608 --> 01:19:58.342
Yeah!
Yes, yes!

01:20:11.523 --> 01:20:13.224
Yeah!

01:20:23.068 --> 01:20:26.270
Josh is on his way back down.

01:20:26.304 --> 01:20:27.338
You see him?

01:20:46.057 --> 01:20:47.591
Go, Kyle!

01:20:50.395 --> 01:20:52.463
Oh, they're going
down mine field.

01:20:52.497 --> 01:20:55.966
It's Kyle and Josh
on the mine field
dirt staircase,

01:20:56.001 --> 01:20:59.270
coming down
to terra firma before,

01:20:59.304 --> 01:21:01.138
dare I say it,

01:21:01.173 --> 01:21:02.339
devil's revenge.

01:21:02.374 --> 01:21:04.742
Mountain biking's mother lode.

01:21:08.313 --> 01:21:09.413
No way!

01:21:20.959 --> 01:21:22.860
Yes!
All right!

01:21:39.311 --> 01:21:40.678
Hey!
Whoa!

01:21:40.712 --> 01:21:42.947
Hey, neat jump,
but the trail's that way.

01:21:42.981 --> 01:21:45.583
Yo! Trail!

01:21:45.617 --> 01:21:47.685
What are you doing?

01:21:47.719 --> 01:21:50.087
The buffalo are headed
toward town.

01:21:50.121 --> 01:21:52.389
We have to stop them
before they reach
the Ridge.

01:21:52.424 --> 01:21:53.757
How?

01:21:53.792 --> 01:21:56.393
Josh, what exactly did you see?

01:21:56.428 --> 01:21:57.461
The whole herd,

01:21:57.495 --> 01:21:59.363
going towards turquoise trail.

01:22:00.298 --> 01:22:01.599
Let's go!

01:22:01.633 --> 01:22:04.602
The buffalo are stampeding!

01:22:04.636 --> 01:22:06.537
They're gonna destroy the town!

01:22:13.678 --> 01:22:15.813
Dude, that was awesome!
I mean, did you see me?

01:22:15.847 --> 01:22:18.215
I totally kicked his butt
right out of the chute.

01:22:18.250 --> 01:22:19.316
No, you didn't.

01:22:19.351 --> 01:22:21.685
Whatever. I rule now.

01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:23.721
Didn't you hear?
The herd got out.

01:22:23.755 --> 01:22:25.155
Not my job.

01:22:25.190 --> 01:22:26.557
Those guys need help.

01:22:26.591 --> 01:22:28.559
You don't live there, remember?

01:22:28.593 --> 01:22:30.060
Come on.

01:22:30.095 --> 01:22:31.895
Dude, I'm gonna finish the race.

01:22:57.155 --> 01:22:59.189
We need to lead them
to the western end...

01:22:59.224 --> 01:23:01.091
Over there.

01:23:01.126 --> 01:23:03.027
Don't get too close.

01:23:03.061 --> 01:23:05.062
They want to go where
we want them to go.

01:23:05.096 --> 01:23:07.464
They just need to know
where that is.

01:23:10.435 --> 01:23:11.969
Watch out, ok?

01:23:12.003 --> 01:23:13.704
Yeah. You, too.

01:23:13.738 --> 01:23:15.139
Let's ride!

01:23:32.791 --> 01:23:37.194
Hey, guys, follow me.

01:23:45.670 --> 01:23:47.538

Radio deejay:
Good evening,
turquoise trail,

01:25:39.184 --> 01:25:41.051
and we really mean that.

01:25:41.085 --> 01:25:43.420
You know, things and people
come into our lives

01:25:43.455 --> 01:25:44.988
and we don't always know why

01:25:45.023 --> 01:25:47.157
until we live through
a day like today.

01:25:47.192 --> 01:25:49.092
Yeah! Ha!

01:25:49.127 --> 01:25:51.562
Radio deejay: Now that
the buffalo are back
where they belong

01:25:51.596 --> 01:25:53.931
and our kids are safe
and soaking their knees,

01:25:53.965 --> 01:25:57.100
we want to thank everyone.
You were awesome, guys.

01:25:57.135 --> 01:25:58.302
Sleep tight.

01:26:05.910 --> 01:26:08.111
Yet eh.

01:26:08.146 --> 01:26:09.780
Yet eh.

01:26:09.814 --> 01:26:11.215
Hey, very good, Josh.

01:26:11.249 --> 01:26:14.284
Um... This is
prickly pear salad,

01:26:14.319 --> 01:26:16.520
that's prickly pear salsa,

01:26:16.554 --> 01:26:20.290
and this is
prickly pear surprise.

01:26:20.325 --> 01:26:22.726
Is that rice wild
enough for you?

01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:23.994
Totally neat.

01:26:24.028 --> 01:26:24.995
Mmm.

01:26:25.029 --> 01:26:27.030
Come in, everyone.

01:26:33.304 --> 01:26:36.139
Navajo can reside in the city,

01:26:36.174 --> 01:26:38.075
but we can never
really live there.

01:26:38.109 --> 01:26:41.578
The memories of our
animal brothers and
sisters are within us.

01:26:41.613 --> 01:26:45.115
They wake and stir
when we come to
our holy place,

01:26:45.149 --> 01:26:47.150
our <i> dinetah.</i>

01:26:49.888 --> 01:26:51.855
This belonged to your father.

01:26:51.890 --> 01:26:53.757
He'd be very proud of you.

01:26:53.791 --> 01:26:56.460
The arrowhead
represents courage,

01:26:56.494 --> 01:26:59.796
strength, and survival.

01:26:59.831 --> 01:27:03.834
When you wear this,
you honor our ancestors.

01:27:03.868 --> 01:27:07.938
Their great strength
allowed the denai to
survive.

01:27:07.972 --> 01:27:11.275
Through your veins runs
the blood of a proud people.

01:27:11.309 --> 01:27:16.513
Sometimes these truths
come to us from strangers
who become friends.

01:27:20.418 --> 01:27:25.589
Tonight we thank
and honor Josh townsend

01:27:25.623 --> 01:27:28.926
for uniting so many
to sustain the buffalo.

01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:32.296
You have earned the name
"rides-with-the-wind."

01:27:32.330 --> 01:27:36.800
The two of you have
lived the ideals of
friendship and loyalty

01:27:36.834 --> 01:27:38.535
that bind nations together.

01:27:38.570 --> 01:27:43.540
When every member
fulfills his
responsibility

01:27:43.575 --> 01:27:45.609
as you two have,

01:27:45.643 --> 01:27:47.578
we are all blessed.

01:27:58.456 --> 01:28:00.324
Yo, Thomas blackhorse.

01:28:00.358 --> 01:28:02.593
Yes, Josh
rides-with-the-wind.

01:28:02.627 --> 01:28:05.062
It's a nice place
you've got here.

01:28:05.096 --> 01:28:07.030
Better take care of it.

01:28:07.065 --> 01:28:09.333
We will, right?
