WEBVTT

00:04.999 --> 00:06.465
Oh.

00:07.368 --> 00:09.068
You made coffee.

00:09.103 --> 00:10.536
Mm-hmm.

00:10.571 --> 00:13.472
<i>And</i> you are in my robe.

00:13.507 --> 00:16.008
I stopped walking around
naked about 20 years ago.

00:16.043 --> 00:17.676
And started cross-dressing?

00:21.015 --> 00:23.048
Mm-mm.

00:23.084 --> 00:24.483
Mm.

00:27.455 --> 00:29.254
Work?

00:29.290 --> 00:31.256
Yeah. A body
was found

00:31.292 --> 00:33.992
on parklands
in western Virginia.

00:34.028 --> 00:36.795
It's being brought
back to the lab.

00:38.065 --> 00:39.665
Can I see you later?

00:39.700 --> 00:41.700
Don't be so worried.

00:41.736 --> 00:43.502
I simply like you.

00:43.537 --> 00:45.938
And I
really like this robe.

00:52.747 --> 00:54.780
<i>How do you feel
about cauliflower?</i>

00:54.815 --> 00:56.949
<i>Roasted? Yeah, that's good.
Boiled? Ugh.</i>

00:56.984 --> 00:58.684
That's disgusting.
So, what are you doing

00:58.719 --> 01:00.219
over there?
Oh, meal planning.

01:00.254 --> 01:02.588
I figured, as long as
you're driving me to work,

01:02.623 --> 01:04.590
we might as well use
the time productively.

01:04.625 --> 01:06.959
Or we could listen to sports talk.
On to scheduling.

01:06.994 --> 01:10.195
Hank has a doctor's
appointment on the 12th.

01:10.231 --> 01:12.731
Will he get shots?
Vaccines, yes,

01:12.767 --> 01:14.099
which means
he might be cranky.

01:14.135 --> 01:16.034
One of us should plan
to go in late that day.

01:16.070 --> 01:17.870
Then there's
Christine's field trip.

01:17.905 --> 01:20.572
Permission slip's in the glove
compartment. I can turn it in.

01:20.608 --> 01:22.608
Okay.

01:22.643 --> 01:24.877
Booth, are you looking
at motorcycles?

01:24.912 --> 01:27.379
Yeah, just a few,
you know, for fun.

01:27.414 --> 01:29.782
You are not buying a motorcycle.
You can't just decide that.

01:29.817 --> 01:32.618
I accept the inherent
risks of our jobs.

01:32.653 --> 01:34.620
Why take on
additional ones?

01:34.655 --> 01:36.421
I'd wear a helmet.

01:36.457 --> 01:38.557
Broken clavicle,

01:38.592 --> 01:40.894
<i>shattered pelvis, compound
fractures of the femur...</i>

01:40.918 --> 01:41.928
<i>Okay, I get it.</i>

01:41.929 --> 01:44.730
Well, I'll say one thing
about the victim...

01:44.765 --> 01:46.765
at least he died
with his boots on.

01:46.801 --> 01:49.001
He was bound.
Unclear whether it was

01:49.036 --> 01:51.436
before or after he was killed.
Nuchal crest

01:51.472 --> 01:54.339
and supraorbital margin
confirm male.

01:54.375 --> 01:56.608
Significant texturing
on the sternal rib ends

01:56.644 --> 01:58.510
suggests he was
in his mid-30s.

01:58.546 --> 02:00.245
And... quite a smoker.

02:00.281 --> 02:02.815
Take a look at the discoloration
on the remaining lung tissue.

02:02.850 --> 02:04.783
<i>Staphylinidae</i> maturity

02:04.819 --> 02:07.019
puts time of death
at approximately 26 days ago.

02:07.054 --> 02:08.920
Wow, he was out there for weeks.

02:08.955 --> 02:10.889
And cause of death
is pretty clear:

02:10.925 --> 02:13.325
multiple gunshot wounds
to the torso,

02:13.360 --> 02:16.161
one most likely hitting
the inferior vena cava,

02:16.197 --> 02:17.663
and another,

02:17.698 --> 02:19.698
possibly the liver.
He bled out.

02:19.733 --> 02:21.733
Dr. Hodgins,
will you take a look

02:21.769 --> 02:23.097
at the residue around
these gunshot wounds?

02:23.121 --> 02:24.571
Oh, wow, that looks like

02:24.572 --> 02:27.005
black gunpowder. Yeah.

02:27.041 --> 02:29.508
I mean, I'll run it through
the mass spec to be sure,

02:29.543 --> 02:30.976
but it's rarely used now.

02:31.011 --> 02:33.045
It was more common
in the early 1900s.

02:33.080 --> 02:34.980
There's
an antemortem fracture

02:35.015 --> 02:36.782
on the left mandible.

02:36.817 --> 02:38.616
Remodeling puts it
at about five years ago.

02:38.640 --> 02:39.752
Also, Cam,

02:39.753 --> 02:42.321
I found these hairs on
the victim's clothing.

02:42.356 --> 02:44.089
Based on the width

02:44.124 --> 02:46.225
of the medulla, uh,
it's horsehair.

02:46.260 --> 02:47.860
Plus, I found
leather particulates

02:47.895 --> 02:49.194
on the victim's
forehead.

02:49.230 --> 02:50.863
Let me guess--
cowboy hat?

02:50.898 --> 02:52.431
You said it,
not me.

02:52.466 --> 02:55.334
Angela says
her facial reconstruction

02:55.369 --> 02:57.169
should be finished shortly.

02:57.204 --> 02:59.137
And I've almost completed
the initial evaluation,

02:59.173 --> 03:02.341
so I can write up my notes
for you before I leave.

03:02.376 --> 03:03.775
Leave? Why are you leaving?

03:03.811 --> 03:05.143
Well, Dr. Hodgins

03:05.179 --> 03:07.446
has been requesting

03:07.481 --> 03:09.448
a microplate fluorometer,
and in order to make it work,

03:09.483 --> 03:10.716
I had to make

03:10.751 --> 03:12.251
a few cutbacks, including...

03:12.286 --> 03:13.819
intern hours.
It'll only be

03:13.854 --> 03:15.721
for two weeks, and I will
be eternally grateful.

03:15.756 --> 03:18.257
Well...
I do understand the importance

03:18.292 --> 03:20.425
of functional equipment.
The victim has

03:20.461 --> 03:23.695
pronounced muscle attachments
in the proximal and distal phalanges

03:23.731 --> 03:24.897
on the right index finger.

03:24.932 --> 03:26.365
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

03:26.400 --> 03:27.699
His trigger finger?

03:27.735 --> 03:30.168
His right hand does
show dominance, so yes.

03:30.204 --> 03:31.536
Also, there are signs

03:31.572 --> 03:34.606
of osteoarthritis

03:34.642 --> 03:35.941
in the right shoulder.

03:35.976 --> 03:37.209
Those markers combined

03:37.244 --> 03:38.877
could suggest
heavy firearms use.

03:38.913 --> 03:40.779
Plus,
the jaw injury

03:40.814 --> 03:42.047
Ms. Wick found earlier

03:42.082 --> 03:43.882
could have been the result
of kickback

03:43.918 --> 03:45.851
from a shotgun.
Okay, is there anything

03:45.886 --> 03:47.619
about this guy that
<i>doesn't</i> scream cowboy?

03:47.655 --> 03:49.221
Yeah. How about the fact

03:49.256 --> 03:52.024
that he was an accountant?

03:52.059 --> 03:55.627
Uh, Stanley Belridge, 34.

03:55.663 --> 03:59.064
- He's not exactly a cowboy.
- No.

03:59.099 --> 04:02.534

was killed at the O.K. Corral?

Lived in Baltimore, Maryland.
No family in the vicinity.

04:44.611 --> 04:46.978
Not many friends.
Reported missing

04:47.014 --> 04:49.347

I'm sorry, two weeks ago?

04:49.383 --> 04:51.449
Wait, the guy's been dead
for almost a month--

what's the Baltimore PD saying?
That, uh, missing adults

Dr. Brennan is...

05:08.402 --> 05:10.638
letting
you get a motorcycle?

05:10.639 --> 05:13.624
Do me a favor. Just turn around,
walk out of the office, all right?

05:13.625 --> 05:15.201
Okay. Walking.
Just get out of the office.

05:21.682 --> 05:25.383
Really. Why'd it take you so
long to report him missing?

05:25.419 --> 05:28.620
Well, I-I barely knew the guy.
I figured someone else would.

05:28.655 --> 05:30.255
But no one ever called
the office, so...

05:30.290 --> 05:33.491
Did he have any conflicts
with coworkers, clients?

05:33.527 --> 05:35.293
Well, it's
an accounting firm.

05:35.328 --> 05:37.295
Not an especially dangerous
place to work.

05:37.330 --> 05:39.931
Well, I'm gonna send

to gather up his files, computer.
Oh, hang on. Uh...

05:43.537 --> 05:45.336
we deal with personal
financial data--

05:45.372 --> 05:47.238
it's all very sensitive.

05:47.274 --> 05:48.873
So you'll need a warrant.

05:48.909 --> 05:51.342
So I'll get one.

05:52.646 --> 05:55.013
Soil samples from the
victim's boot treads

05:55.048 --> 05:57.515
do not match soil
samples from the scene.

05:57.551 --> 06:00.051
So we have a body dump.
Yep.

06:00.087 --> 06:02.353
What's all this?
Oh, this is where

06:02.389 --> 06:05.427
the victim was before he died--
the Frontier Games.

06:05.627 --> 06:07.899
It's a weekend-long,
role-playing,

06:07.900 --> 06:09.900
Old-West-style
shooting competition.

06:09.935 --> 06:11.468
Fun! Sign me up.

06:11.503 --> 06:13.837
It's held once a month
on a private campground

06:13.872 --> 06:15.439
owned by Francine

06:15.474 --> 06:17.174
and Luke Nichols.
Hey, check it out.

06:17.209 --> 06:18.475
There's our victim.

06:19.712 --> 06:21.378
Slow Burn Stanley?

06:21.413 --> 06:23.547
Okay, now, that is awesome.

06:23.582 --> 06:25.449
Well, that explains
the horsehair.

06:25.484 --> 06:26.983
What about those guns?

06:27.019 --> 06:28.985
Are they vintage?
Yes, all of them are.

06:29.021 --> 06:30.795
It's part of the rules
of the competition.

06:30.895 --> 06:31.994
Look at the
final score.

06:32.030 --> 06:33.229
Stanley won.

06:33.264 --> 06:34.864
It's a $10,000 prize.

06:34.899 --> 06:37.407
So our motive could be robbery.

06:37.507 --> 06:39.140
Wait a second.
But if the victim died

06:39.175 --> 06:41.542
26 days ago and this event
takes place once a month,

06:41.577 --> 06:43.611
then that should mean...
The next Frontier Games

06:43.646 --> 06:45.679
will be taking place
this weekend.

06:45.715 --> 06:48.015
Why do I have a feeling
Booth already knows this?

06:48.050 --> 06:50.412
<i>Undercover?</i>
Seriously?

06:50.413 --> 06:53.188
Well, the likely suspects
are the participants. Look.

06:53.222 --> 06:54.722
85% of the competitors

06:54.757 --> 06:56.857
are repeat guests...

06:56.893 --> 06:59.026
from all over
the Eastern Seaboard.

06:59.061 --> 07:00.887
Which is exactly why
we have to go undercover.

07:00.888 --> 07:03.122
Because if we don't, we're gonna
have to coordinate branches

07:03.157 --> 07:05.942
in seven different states,
we're never gonna find the suspects...

07:06.042 --> 07:08.075
Oh. You just want
to dress up

07:08.111 --> 07:10.811
and play cowboy for the weekend.
Yeah, well, if I can do that

07:10.847 --> 07:13.347
and solve a crime, why,
who <i> wouldn't</i> want to do that?

07:13.383 --> 07:15.016
Do you have a problem with that?
Definitely not.

07:15.051 --> 07:16.751
In fact, I think that
I should probably go with you.

07:16.786 --> 07:18.753
I haven't been on a horse
in a while, but I would love

07:18.788 --> 07:21.022
to hit the trails.
It's not a dude ranch,

07:21.057 --> 07:23.958
Aubrey, it's a shooting competition.
I can also play

07:23.993 --> 07:26.360
every great cowboy song there is
on my guitar,

07:26.396 --> 07:27.232
and that could be helpful.

07:27.233 --> 07:29.012
How could that
possibly be helpful?

07:29.013 --> 07:31.280
You know what?
Best you just stay here, okay?

07:31.315 --> 07:33.082
I'm afraid I can't
leave the lab.

07:33.117 --> 07:34.850
I don't have an intern
this weekend,

07:34.885 --> 07:37.352
and there's still a great deal
of work to be done

07:37.388 --> 07:40.489
with the remains.
Fine, then I'll do it alone, Wanda.

07:40.524 --> 07:43.492
Oh. Is that something you
guys do, split up like that?

07:43.527 --> 07:45.994
Well...
it's hardly splitting up.

07:46.030 --> 07:47.596
Nah.
And if Agent Booth feels

07:47.631 --> 07:50.065
that is the best way
to solve the case, then...

07:50.101 --> 07:51.867
he should do it.

07:51.902 --> 07:53.035
Giddyap!

07:56.440 --> 07:59.675
I found damage to the neural
arches on at least two

07:59.710 --> 08:01.844
of the victim's
cervical vertebrae...

08:01.879 --> 08:04.413
I thought you were
Dr. Saroyan.

08:04.448 --> 08:05.981
So, what is this I'm hearing

08:06.016 --> 08:08.817
about Booth going undercover
without you?

08:08.853 --> 08:10.819
I'll admit,
I find it a bit strange.

08:10.855 --> 08:14.256
But then again, I find a lot
of Booth's behavior strange

08:14.291 --> 08:17.359
these days.
Meaning what?

08:17.394 --> 08:19.561
Well, first he wanted a Jet Ski.

08:19.597 --> 08:22.364
Now he's looking at motorcycles.
He's only recently

08:22.399 --> 08:25.767
recovered from being shot,
and he wants to...

08:25.803 --> 08:28.437
put his life in danger for...

08:28.472 --> 08:30.772
I don't know what.

08:30.808 --> 08:32.474
Yeah, I think I do.

08:32.510 --> 08:34.743
Excitement.
Basically,

08:34.778 --> 08:36.879
what you're saying is...

08:36.914 --> 08:39.248
our life together
has become routine,

08:39.283 --> 08:42.417
and... Booth needs
to have some fun.

08:42.453 --> 08:46.021
I'm saying that both of you
need to have some fun.

09:31.902 --> 09:33.468
It was good.
Glad to hear it.

09:33.504 --> 09:34.970
You done much
target shooting, Buck?

09:35.005 --> 09:37.940
Oh, a bit. Looks like
Slow Burn Stanley there

09:37.975 --> 09:40.642
is the one to beat.
Oh, well, you're in luck,

09:40.678 --> 09:42.644
because I don't think
he's coming this month.

09:42.680 --> 09:43.979
- Why's that?
- No clue,

09:44.014 --> 09:45.847
but he sure will be missed.

09:47.685 --> 09:49.218
Bit jumpy there, eh, Buck?

09:49.253 --> 09:50.619
Sure you can handle this?

09:50.654 --> 09:53.822
Don't worry about me, Luke--
I can handle myself.

09:53.857 --> 09:56.725
All right.

10:01.899 --> 10:04.533
You busy?
Hey. I was just looking

10:04.568 --> 10:06.001
at some bearberry foliage.

10:06.036 --> 10:07.603
It's all over the
victim's clothing,

10:07.638 --> 10:10.872
suggesting that he fell into
a patch of bushes, so...

10:10.908 --> 10:12.374
What's up?

10:12.409 --> 10:15.043
You're not getting that
microplate fluorometer.

10:15.079 --> 10:17.379
At least not this month.
Wh-Why not?

10:17.414 --> 10:19.481
Cam said...
I convinced Cam

10:19.516 --> 10:21.650
to pay Daisy double-time
to come in

10:21.685 --> 10:22.851
over the weekend.

10:22.886 --> 10:24.052
Brennan had to leave.

10:24.088 --> 10:25.387
Which leads me

10:25.422 --> 10:27.155
to the next item.
Christine and Hank

10:27.191 --> 10:29.157
will be staying with us
over the weekend.

10:29.193 --> 10:30.626
Great!

10:30.661 --> 10:33.488
I mean, Hank sleeps
through the night by now, right?

10:33.489 --> 10:35.464
I don't...
No, I don't think so.

10:35.499 --> 10:37.866
Just consider it practice.
Practice?

10:37.901 --> 10:39.301
For what?

10:39.336 --> 10:41.703
Angela?

10:41.739 --> 10:43.839
♪ ♪

10:45.242 --> 10:46.808
Fellas.

10:48.679 --> 10:51.046
I got room for you!

11:15.608 --> 11:17.975
Allow me
to introduce myself, ma'am.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.509
Marshal Glen Gold Dust.

11:19.545 --> 11:21.712
Hello. I'm Wild Card Wanda.

11:21.747 --> 11:24.281
Quickest draw in all of Bony Ridge.

11:25.484 --> 11:26.924
Something funny
over there, stranger?

11:26.952 --> 11:28.785
Nope.
And you are?

11:28.821 --> 11:30.187
Big River Buck.

11:30.222 --> 11:32.623
Notorious highwayman.
Highwayman, huh?

11:32.658 --> 11:36.159
Guess that makes you and me
natural enemies.

11:36.195 --> 11:38.362
But seriously, it's-it's both
your first times here, right?

11:38.397 --> 11:40.063
I mean, I've been
coming for years, so if ya'll

11:40.099 --> 11:41.365
need anything, just ask me.

11:41.400 --> 11:42.766
Especially you, Wanda.

11:42.801 --> 11:44.835
I could use a root beer.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.670
Well, that is coming right up.

11:46.705 --> 11:48.205
Much obliged.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.007
What are you doing here?
Being unexpected

11:50.042 --> 11:51.708
and exciting.

11:51.744 --> 11:54.044
And solving a murder,
of course.

11:54.079 --> 11:55.812
That's great and all,
but you do realize

11:55.848 --> 11:58.682
that you just introduced
us as strangers.

11:58.717 --> 12:00.584
What are we gonna do now?
We'll figure it out.

12:00.619 --> 12:01.952
There's not much that's

12:01.987 --> 12:04.287
routine about
this situation, is there?

12:04.323 --> 12:05.789
Wild Card Wanda?

12:05.824 --> 12:07.124
Mm-hmm.
Wanda,

12:07.159 --> 12:10.327
uh, Buck,
this here's Sweet Rose Sadie.

12:10.362 --> 12:11.695
Railroad heiress.

12:11.730 --> 12:14.164
- Ma'am.
- Hey, Beau, come on over here.

12:14.199 --> 12:16.033
How you doing? You get
to see your kids this month?

12:16.068 --> 12:17.534
Yeah, I managed
to put a little money together,

12:17.569 --> 12:18.935
pay everything off.

12:18.971 --> 12:21.204
Mm, that is wonderful.
I see we have

12:21.240 --> 12:22.939
some new competition.
Mm-hmm.

12:22.975 --> 12:24.408
I'm Kentucky Loco Beau.

12:24.443 --> 12:25.942
Hey, you guys see
Stan's not here?

12:25.978 --> 12:27.511
Well, I'll miss him.

12:27.546 --> 12:29.713
But I got to say...
God bless you, Stan,

12:29.748 --> 12:31.648
'cause now maybe one of us
has got

12:31.684 --> 12:33.450
a shot at the win.
Hear, hear.

12:33.485 --> 12:35.552
To Slow Burn Stan.

12:35.587 --> 12:37.521
Cheers.

12:37.556 --> 12:40.657
I really appreciate you being
so flexible, Ms. Wick.

12:40.693 --> 12:42.325
It's no problem.

12:42.361 --> 12:44.227
I can use the overtime
for Lance's college fund.

12:44.263 --> 12:46.763
Have you started
extracting the bullets yet?

12:46.799 --> 12:49.066
I was just about to.
There's one embedded

12:49.101 --> 12:50.500
here in the
L4 vertebra.

12:50.536 --> 12:53.870
And another one here,
in the articular facet

12:53.906 --> 12:55.939
of the vertebral tenth rib.

12:55.974 --> 12:58.508
Ms. Wick, can you take a look
at the left ilium?

12:58.544 --> 13:02.045
Is that a nick
or a defect?

13:02.081 --> 13:03.747
It's a nick,
perimortem.

13:03.782 --> 13:06.083
Damage consistent with that
of another gunshot.

13:06.118 --> 13:08.285
Must have been
a through and through.

13:08.320 --> 13:11.254
The exit wound would have been
extremely close to the ilium.

13:11.290 --> 13:12.589
Have Hodgins swab it.

13:12.624 --> 13:14.464
It may provide clues
to the actual murder site.

13:14.493 --> 13:15.859
Hey, I just got

13:15.894 --> 13:17.294
off the phone
with Sebastian Kohl,

13:17.329 --> 13:20.263
who said he left some
stuff on my porch

13:20.299 --> 13:22.499
because he was in the area.

13:22.534 --> 13:24.234
Who's Sebastian?
Uh, shouldn't you

13:24.269 --> 13:26.269
be working?
He's a gorgeous,

13:26.305 --> 13:28.038
smart, very successful
photographer

13:28.073 --> 13:30.440
who does not live
anywhere near me.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.542
However, Cam does.

13:32.578 --> 13:33.877
Which means the
reason that he was

13:33.912 --> 13:35.412
in my area is because
he had just

13:35.447 --> 13:37.447
been in your area.

13:37.483 --> 13:39.316
Are you
seeing someone,

13:39.351 --> 13:41.017
Dr. Saroyan?
No.

13:41.053 --> 13:44.788
I mean, yes.
But it means nothing.

13:44.823 --> 13:47.224
Uh, it means nothing.

13:50.162 --> 13:53.029
All right, now,
this here event is called

13:53.065 --> 13:55.098
the Great Bank Robbery.

13:55.134 --> 13:58.201
First up, Big River Buck.

13:58.237 --> 14:00.437
One pistol, five rounds.
Shooter ready?

14:00.472 --> 14:03.607
Ready, ma'am.
Give the cue, the clock will start.

14:03.642 --> 14:05.375
You're surrounded
by rangers,

14:05.410 --> 14:07.644
you yellow-bellied cowards.

14:14.853 --> 14:18.655
Two out of five targets,
6.25 seconds.

14:22.427 --> 14:24.828
You shot the bank teller
that you were trying to protect.

14:24.863 --> 14:27.898
That penalty's gonna cost you.

14:27.933 --> 14:30.200
Better luck on the next event.
What do you got?

14:30.235 --> 14:31.968
That guy you wanted me
to look into--

14:32.004 --> 14:33.103
uh, Kentucky what's-his-face--

14:33.138 --> 14:34.571
his name's Robert Macintosh,

14:34.606 --> 14:36.606
lives in Pennsylvania.
Recently paid off

14:36.642 --> 14:40.210
$6,000 in delinquent
child support in cash.

14:40.245 --> 14:43.547
There's nothing suspicious
about that.

14:43.582 --> 14:45.749
There's no cell phones in
the communal areas, Buck.

14:45.784 --> 14:47.651
It isn't in the spirit
of the games.

14:47.686 --> 14:49.519
I'm just finishing up.

14:49.555 --> 14:53.156
Next up, Wild Card Wanda.

14:55.961 --> 14:57.394
Shooter ready?

14:57.429 --> 14:59.329
Waiting on
your cue.

14:59.364 --> 15:00.664
You're surrounded
by rangers,

15:00.699 --> 15:03.834
you yellow-bellied coward.

15:09.141 --> 15:12.509
Five out of five targets,
4.8 seconds.

15:14.546 --> 15:16.546
Well, I'll be damned.

15:16.582 --> 15:19.049
I think I'm falling in love.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.918
♪ ♪

15:25.324 --> 15:28.358
Hey. All I'm finding on
the victim's computer

15:28.393 --> 15:30.093
are boring
accounting docs,

15:30.128 --> 15:31.494
so think I'm
gonna figure out

15:31.530 --> 15:33.063
how to rearrange
those car seats.

15:33.098 --> 15:37.100
Yeah, um, Angie, do you
have something to tell me?

15:37.135 --> 15:39.369
Oh... I'm not pregnant.

15:39.404 --> 15:41.638
Wow, you look

15:41.673 --> 15:43.273
way too relieved.
What? No, no,

15:43.308 --> 15:44.608
it's just... Come on, we haven't

15:44.643 --> 15:46.109
really talked about this yet.

15:46.144 --> 15:50.213
But you know I've always
wanted a big family.

15:50.249 --> 15:53.416
I think we need
to think about this.

15:53.452 --> 15:56.286
Okay. I will.
I promise.

15:56.321 --> 15:57.954
Okay.

15:57.990 --> 15:59.621
Let me know if you need help
with the car seats.

15:59.721 --> 16:01.191
Yeah, all four of them.
I'm sor...

16:01.226 --> 16:03.093
Uh, uh, four?
Yeah,

16:03.128 --> 16:05.295
I told Daisy we'd take Lance
for a few hours

16:05.330 --> 16:07.864
so she could go shopping.

16:12.504 --> 16:13.803
There you go.

16:13.839 --> 16:15.472
Thank you.

16:17.075 --> 16:20.443
That was some nice
shooting out there, Wanda.

16:20.479 --> 16:22.078
You know, you made the board.

16:22.114 --> 16:23.880
Oh, thank you.

16:23.916 --> 16:25.181
I noticed your limp.

16:25.217 --> 16:26.783
Are you hurt?
Oh, that.

16:26.818 --> 16:29.452
No, I fell off my horse
about a month ago. Guess it just

16:29.488 --> 16:30.987
didn't heal right.
You should consider

16:31.023 --> 16:33.290
an anterior hip replacement.
I knew it.

16:33.325 --> 16:34.991
You're a doctor
or something, right?

16:35.027 --> 16:37.160
Me? No, I-I'm-I'm...

16:37.195 --> 16:39.129
Oh, you... I get it.

16:39.164 --> 16:41.264
Here, you're Wild Card Wanda,

16:41.300 --> 16:43.166
that's it.

16:47.105 --> 16:48.672
Yeah, uh, so

16:48.707 --> 16:51.041
Aubrey says they got a lead
on an abandoned car

16:51.076 --> 16:53.109
at a bus station
right around here.

16:53.145 --> 16:54.611
Could be our victim.

16:54.646 --> 16:56.346
Hodgins is working on
particulate evidence

16:56.381 --> 16:58.248
from the dump site.

16:58.283 --> 16:59.916
You're not doing
very well, Booth.

16:59.952 --> 17:01.152
You didn't even
make the board.

17:01.186 --> 17:02.585
I'm not even trying.

17:02.621 --> 17:05.288
Right.
Miss Wanda,

17:05.324 --> 17:07.557
would you care to accompany me
to the barbecue?

17:07.592 --> 17:09.459
Why, yes, that
sounds lovely.

17:09.493 --> 17:11.627
Ah.

17:16.300 --> 17:18.134
Techs confirmed the car
that was found at the bus stop

17:18.170 --> 17:20.303
did belong to the victim.
No sign of forced entry

17:20.339 --> 17:22.137
or struggle.
His bags, weapons,

17:22.174 --> 17:24.007
and all other
weekend paraphernalia were

17:24.041 --> 17:25.809
still inside of his trunk.
Abandoned by the killer?

17:25.844 --> 17:27.510
Looks that way.

17:27.546 --> 17:29.579
I'll bring the forensic samples
and all the other contents

17:29.614 --> 17:32.449
by the Jeffersonian once I take
a look. Oh, and get this--

17:32.484 --> 17:35.352
the, uh, prize check
that he won for the $10,000,

17:35.387 --> 17:36.619
it's still inside of his bag.

17:36.655 --> 17:38.922
Mm. There goes
our robbery motive.

17:38.957 --> 17:41.324
We've got some info
about the murder site.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.660
Hodgins found microscopic
splinters of wood

17:43.695 --> 17:45.362
from a Douglas fir inside

17:45.397 --> 17:47.831
the victim's gunshot wounds.
Douglas fir doesn't grow

17:47.866 --> 17:48.932
around those parts of Virginia.

17:48.967 --> 17:50.600
Yeah, the splinters were coated

17:50.635 --> 17:52.602
with phenol formaldehyde resin,

17:52.637 --> 17:56.473
soda ash, organic pigment
and calcium carbonate.

17:56.508 --> 17:58.808
Hodgins said they could be
painted plywood.

17:58.844 --> 18:00.643
I'll give Booth a call,
see what he thinks.

18:00.679 --> 18:01.711
What are you eating?

18:01.747 --> 18:03.179
Oh, ribs,

18:03.215 --> 18:05.882
brisket, corn,
cornbread, slaw.

18:05.917 --> 18:07.517
Fries.
I heard Booth and Brennan

18:07.552 --> 18:09.019
were having a barbecue,
got a little bit jealous.

18:09.054 --> 18:10.253
Uh, yeah, I can tell.

18:10.288 --> 18:11.454
Hey, did Dr. Brennan

18:11.490 --> 18:12.756
say what kind of
barbecue it was--

18:12.791 --> 18:14.591
Kansas City style, Alabama?

18:14.626 --> 18:15.892
Uh, she's a vegetarian,

18:15.927 --> 18:17.761
Aubrey.
I'm guessing something with

18:17.796 --> 18:19.929
a vinegar base, mustardy,
maybe sweet tomato.

18:19.965 --> 18:21.431
I need to call

18:21.466 --> 18:23.066
Dr. Brennan.
Are we done here?

18:23.101 --> 18:24.367
Personal favorite:

18:24.403 --> 18:26.136
Santa Maria style.
I mean,

18:26.171 --> 18:27.737
the magic that happens between

18:27.773 --> 18:29.539
a fire and a piece of tri-tip...

18:31.076 --> 18:33.176
Hello?

18:36.782 --> 18:37.811
Hey. Psst.

18:37.835 --> 18:39.216
I got your text.
You found something?

18:39.217 --> 18:40.950
Extra flats.
Painted plywood.

18:40.986 --> 18:43.486
Surrounded by bearberry plants.
Yeah.

18:43.522 --> 18:46.089
One of the victim's wounds
was a through and through,

18:46.124 --> 18:48.391
meaning if he was shot
against these flats,

18:48.427 --> 18:50.293
the bullet would still be here.

18:50.328 --> 18:52.862
Yeah, but they're riddled with
bullets, so use that, uh, there

18:52.898 --> 18:55.098
magic light of yours so...
see if we can find anything.

18:55.133 --> 18:58.535
Hopefully we'll find one
with human tissue on it.

19:05.677 --> 19:07.577
- We found the murder site.
- Got it?

19:07.612 --> 19:09.079
Yes.
Yes!

19:09.114 --> 19:10.280
What's... Uh, hey, I saw you

19:10.315 --> 19:11.848
at the barbecue
earlier with Glen.

19:11.883 --> 19:13.616
I mean...
I'm sorry, but what are you

19:13.652 --> 19:15.752
trying to do-- you trying
to make me jealous or something?

19:15.787 --> 19:17.087
No, I'm just... I'm behaving

19:17.122 --> 19:19.889
in a non-routine manner.
Yeah, but why?

19:19.925 --> 19:21.324
Because.

19:21.359 --> 19:23.426
Hello. I'm a wild card.

19:23.462 --> 19:25.862
I'm full of fun and surprises.

19:25.897 --> 19:28.331
I'm Wild Card Wanda, baby.

19:33.004 --> 19:34.671
That was Franny.

19:34.706 --> 19:36.239
Why is she following us?

19:38.667 --> 19:41.196
Francine Nichols?
The Frontier Games owner?

19:41.642 --> 19:43.856
Yup. I've been
looking for a motive,

19:43.956 --> 19:45.398
and I think I might have
found something.

19:45.498 --> 19:46.830
This was in
the victim's car.

19:46.866 --> 19:48.699
A book about starting
your own business.

19:48.734 --> 19:50.167
Along with a bunch of

19:50.202 --> 19:52.803
real estate fliers,
all for large, rural properties.

19:52.838 --> 19:55.205
And check out
the notes on them.

19:55.241 --> 19:58.575
"Neighbors might be too close
for gun noise."

19:58.611 --> 20:02.479
"Easy to find from airport
for out-of-towners."

20:02.515 --> 20:04.415
Stanley wanted to start
his own Frontier Games?

20:04.450 --> 20:06.116
That's what
Booth and I are thinking.

20:06.152 --> 20:08.218
Now, Franny comes from money,
so it's not about that.

20:08.254 --> 20:10.554
But Dr. Brennan said she
broke her hip recently.

20:10.589 --> 20:12.456
She couldn't have
done this on her own.

20:12.491 --> 20:15.893
Well, that is where
Beau Macintosh comes in.

20:15.928 --> 20:17.328
You remember that
money that he used

20:17.363 --> 20:19.363
to pay off his child support?
Of course.

20:19.398 --> 20:20.631
I'm tracing it now, but it seems

20:20.666 --> 20:22.466
about the going rate
for an accomplice.

20:25.271 --> 20:26.637
- What...
- Hey, uh, hi.

20:26.672 --> 20:29.807
Oh, um, sorry
we're late.

20:29.842 --> 20:32.076
Christine found
Michael Vincent's face paint,

20:32.111 --> 20:34.044
and we just lost
track of time.

20:34.080 --> 20:36.146
- It's a long story.
- Well, you're just in time.

20:36.182 --> 20:38.982
Agent Aubrey brought over the
contents of the victim's car.

20:39.885 --> 20:41.285
So, Angela--

20:41.320 --> 20:44.655
or should I say
Speedy Bandita?

20:44.690 --> 20:46.957
These look like more of the
victim's work documents.

20:46.992 --> 20:49.560
For you, Toxic Cat Man...
Really?

20:49.595 --> 20:52.162
...this box has the forensic
samples that the FBI techs

20:52.198 --> 20:54.098
removed from
the car.

20:54.133 --> 20:56.300
And, since you're all
here, can you help me

20:56.335 --> 20:58.869
take these guns into
the autopsy room?

21:07.680 --> 21:09.780
Sebastian.

21:09.815 --> 21:11.048
Can you put this...

21:11.083 --> 21:12.216
Yeah.

21:14.120 --> 21:16.420
Well, now that
you're unarmed...

21:16.455 --> 21:18.722
What are you doing here?
I'm on my way to the gallery.

21:18.758 --> 21:21.058
The weather's meant to be lovely
tonight, and I was considering

21:21.093 --> 21:23.227
taking a stroll
around the reflecting pool.

21:23.262 --> 21:24.895
Care to join me?

21:24.930 --> 21:28.031
Oh, I'm not...

21:31.203 --> 21:33.971
I'm having so much fun
with you, Sebastian.

21:34.006 --> 21:36.840
I mean, truly,
this has been a gift.

21:36.876 --> 21:40.177
But a... a walk.

21:40.212 --> 21:42.246
I think I understand.

21:42.281 --> 21:44.748
Sorry.

21:52.191 --> 21:54.992
Is this the victim's
left mandible?

21:55.027 --> 21:57.027
Upon reexamination,
I found perimortem,

21:57.062 --> 21:59.730
interosseous bruising
and subchondral lesions.

21:59.765 --> 22:01.465
Which were obscured by

22:01.500 --> 22:02.900
his antemortem remodeling.

22:02.935 --> 22:04.268
He was punched.

22:04.303 --> 22:05.769
Astute observation, Ms. Wick.

22:05.805 --> 22:07.504
Thank you.

22:07.540 --> 22:10.641
Ask Dr. Hodgins to review
his initial particulate samples.

22:10.676 --> 22:12.009
Consider it done.

22:12.044 --> 22:14.278
Thank you.
Psst. Hey!

22:14.313 --> 22:15.979
Okay, look,
I was right, okay?

22:16.015 --> 22:17.581
Aubrey says
that Franny's the one

22:17.616 --> 22:19.516
that's been giving Beau
all the money.

22:19.552 --> 22:22.820
And Daisy said the victim was
punched before he was shot.

22:22.855 --> 22:24.454
Booth.

22:26.192 --> 22:29.092
I feel so foolish.

22:29.128 --> 22:30.828
Why do you feel so foolish?

22:30.863 --> 22:33.197
All of this, all of it!
Ah.

22:33.232 --> 22:35.966
It's so irrational. I mean,
how could I think that

22:36.001 --> 22:38.202
flirting with another
man and besting you

22:38.237 --> 22:40.571
at a game of skill would
have a positive effect

22:40.606 --> 22:42.139
on our relationship?
Wait a second.

22:42.174 --> 22:43.774
First of all,
if you think I'm worried

22:43.809 --> 22:45.776
about you running off
with some doughy guy

22:45.811 --> 22:47.644
who's dressed in some
U.S. Marshal's outfit

22:47.680 --> 22:49.446
that's way too tight,
you're wrong.

22:49.481 --> 22:52.316
Secondly, besting me?

22:52.351 --> 22:53.817
I'm a trained sniper.

22:53.853 --> 22:55.819
I could win this competition
blindfolded.

22:55.855 --> 22:57.454
The only reason
I'm not doing it is 'cause

22:57.489 --> 22:58.789
I don't want
to raise any eyebrows.

22:58.824 --> 23:00.490
I'm not so sure
about that, Booth.

23:00.526 --> 23:02.593
You're used to cutting-edge weapons.

23:02.628 --> 23:05.796
Cowboy shooting requires a
different sort of finesse.

23:05.831 --> 23:07.866
You really think you can beat me
in this competition?

23:07.890 --> 23:08.399
Oh.

23:08.400 --> 23:10.467
I am beating you, Booth.
Okay, well...

23:10.502 --> 23:11.935
Booth, look.

23:11.971 --> 23:13.503
What?
Look.

23:15.975 --> 23:18.075
You should follow them.
Aren't you gonna come with me?

23:18.110 --> 23:19.843
No, no! We're
together too much.

23:19.879 --> 23:21.144
It's, uh, getting suspicious.

23:21.180 --> 23:22.746
Wait. Oh, I understand
what you want to do.

23:22.781 --> 23:24.047
I see it. I get it.

23:24.083 --> 23:25.816
You want to stay here
and work on your lasso

23:25.851 --> 23:26.850
for the cattle rustling event.

23:26.886 --> 23:28.819
All right, I get it,
I get it.

23:28.854 --> 23:30.387
Well, guess what,
Wild Card Wanda.

23:30.422 --> 23:31.955
You're going down.

23:34.627 --> 23:36.760
They're beautiful,
aren't they?

23:36.795 --> 23:40.364
I've wanted one since I was a kid.
What, the horses?

23:40.399 --> 23:42.900
Franny's always nice enough to
let me ride 'em when I'm here.

23:42.935 --> 23:46.169
Right. Speaking of Franny,
I've been looking for her.

23:46.205 --> 23:47.707
I thought I saw her
somewhere around here.

23:47.731 --> 23:48.873
Check out back.

23:48.874 --> 23:51.475
She's probably
sneaking a cigarette.

23:51.510 --> 23:54.244
Franny smokes?
Don't tell Luke.

23:54.280 --> 23:55.512
He thinks she quit.

23:55.547 --> 23:57.614
He'd kill her if he found out.

23:57.650 --> 23:59.750
Right, right.

24:00.753 --> 24:03.186
I have something for you.

24:03.222 --> 24:05.255
The murder weapon.

24:05.291 --> 24:07.357
A Civil-War-era
Spencer carbine.

24:07.393 --> 24:10.560
We don't even have a
suspect in custody.

24:10.596 --> 24:12.429
Wait a second.

24:12.464 --> 24:13.997
This is the victim's.

24:14.033 --> 24:16.366
Yup. Caliber's a match,
ballistics confirm it.

24:16.402 --> 24:18.936
Do we know who had access to it?
Well,

24:18.971 --> 24:21.738
from what Booth says,
pretty much everyone.

24:21.774 --> 24:23.307
It's a trusting place.

24:23.342 --> 24:25.375
People leave their gun carts
outside, on their porches.

24:25.411 --> 24:26.877
Even someone who
wasn't a contestant

24:26.912 --> 24:29.212
could get on the
property, no problem.

24:34.253 --> 24:35.953
Bones.

24:35.988 --> 24:37.387
Wanda.

24:37.423 --> 24:40.157
All right, Franny
wasn't following us.

24:40.192 --> 24:41.992
How do you know?

24:42.027 --> 24:43.493
Have you been smoking?

24:43.529 --> 24:46.663
Investigating. Oh, look,
I didn't inhale, okay?

24:46.699 --> 24:50.167
Look, my gut is telling me that
Franny and Beau are clean.

24:50.202 --> 24:51.935
Based on evidence,

24:51.971 --> 24:53.770
or some nicotine-fueled flash of insight?
They're friends.

24:53.806 --> 24:55.739
They hang out together.
They're smoking buddies.

24:55.774 --> 24:57.507
What about the rival business?
It wasn't a rival, okay?

24:57.543 --> 24:59.910
She was looking to expand, but
I did find out something else.

24:59.945 --> 25:02.012
What?
Well, they said that

25:02.047 --> 25:03.914
Stan was smoking like
a chimney last month.

25:03.949 --> 25:05.916
You know, like he had
something on his mind.

25:05.951 --> 25:07.150
Did he say what it was?

25:07.186 --> 25:09.019
Well, they said that
it was work-related.

25:09.054 --> 25:11.088
Okay, Big River Buck, you're up.

25:11.123 --> 25:14.057
Watch and learn, Wanda.

25:17.463 --> 25:19.096
Guns ready?
Ready.

25:19.131 --> 25:21.665
- Waiting on your cue.
- You think you can take

25:21.700 --> 25:23.233
my family's cattle, Shorty?

25:23.268 --> 25:25.502
Go ahead and try.

25:47.993 --> 25:51.828
12 out of 12, 20.9 seconds.

25:51.864 --> 25:54.598
Well, I'll be darned, Buck,
you finally kicked it into gear!

25:54.633 --> 25:56.133
Yup.

25:56.168 --> 25:57.834
See that, Wanda?

25:59.772 --> 26:01.371
Wow.

26:01.407 --> 26:03.540
You are the least squinty
of all of us,

26:03.575 --> 26:05.475
and you're literally
sitting in here squinting.

26:05.511 --> 26:07.010
Yeah, it's just weird.

26:07.046 --> 26:09.012
None of the documents
from Stanley's car seem

26:09.048 --> 26:11.248
to be on his hard drive.
That is weird.

26:11.283 --> 26:12.883
I'm gonna run a software
recovery program,

26:12.918 --> 26:14.818
see if maybe some of
them were deleted.

26:14.853 --> 26:16.620
What's on the tray?
Oh, yeah.

26:16.655 --> 26:19.389
So, I found trace amounts of
turpentine on the victim's jaw,

26:19.425 --> 26:21.091
so I've been analyzing
various formulations

26:21.126 --> 26:22.459
to try and find a match,

26:22.494 --> 26:25.195
and I think that I
actually got one there.

26:25.230 --> 26:26.730
"Venice turpentine."

26:26.765 --> 26:29.332
I've used that for-for painting.
Really?

26:29.368 --> 26:32.269
Well, it's primarily used on
horses to repair cracked hooves.

26:32.304 --> 26:34.671
But, yeah, no, it's got,
like, a zillion other uses.

26:34.706 --> 26:37.140
Ooh, hey.

26:37.176 --> 26:38.675
There are the documents.

26:38.710 --> 26:40.844
They were deleted from
the victim's hard drive,

26:40.879 --> 26:42.245
and recently.

26:42.281 --> 26:45.248
How recently?
After he was killed.

26:47.430 --> 26:49.893
Yes, I did delete these
files, but that's it.

26:49.993 --> 26:51.459
I didn't kill the guy.

26:51.494 --> 26:52.925
Well, then, what were you
trying to hide?

26:52.949 --> 26:54.029
Nothing.

26:54.030 --> 26:56.097
I mean, nothing serious.

26:56.132 --> 26:57.799
For Stanley, but for me...

26:57.834 --> 27:00.201
If there is anything that'll
make the flashing red arrow

27:00.237 --> 27:02.503
that says "killer"
stop pointing at your head,

27:02.539 --> 27:04.439
I suggest you spit it out.

27:04.474 --> 27:07.242
Okay. These documents,

27:07.277 --> 27:09.377
the accounts--
they were mine.

27:09.412 --> 27:11.473
I was forcing Stanley
to do my work for me.

27:11.497 --> 27:12.281
Why?

27:12.282 --> 27:13.815
I was trying to finish my novel.

27:13.850 --> 27:15.984
I told Stanley,
if he helped me,

27:16.019 --> 27:18.219
I would recommend
him for a promotion.

27:18.255 --> 27:19.821
But when he disappeared...

27:19.856 --> 27:22.190
Listen, you're gonna
help us out any way you can,

27:22.225 --> 27:25.260
maybe I won't tell your boss about this.
Of course.

27:25.295 --> 27:27.595
Yeah, I'll do anything.
I can't get fired.

27:27.631 --> 27:30.231
Well, not until I'm published,
I mean, and then...

27:34.271 --> 27:36.104
Is that the neurocranium?

27:36.139 --> 27:38.206
I'm still trying
to explain the neck trauma.

27:38.241 --> 27:40.441
The damage may be microscopic.

27:40.477 --> 27:44.312
A large number of microfractures
together could cause

27:44.347 --> 27:45.713
heavy internal bleeding.

27:45.749 --> 27:47.315
Do you think...?

27:47.350 --> 27:49.651
Dr. Brennan,
are you still there?

27:49.686 --> 27:51.452
Oh, I'm here.

27:51.488 --> 27:54.622
I'm just preparing to outshoot
Agent Booth at High Noon.

27:54.658 --> 27:57.725
I suggest you do
a microscopic analysis

27:57.761 --> 28:01.896
of the frontal bone via
cross sections, one cell thick.

28:01.931 --> 28:04.332
I'll get started right away.

28:04.367 --> 28:06.067
Um, go get 'em, Dr. Brennan.

28:06.102 --> 28:08.369
The name's Wild Card Wanda now,
Ms. Wick.

28:08.405 --> 28:11.072
And I will.

28:11.107 --> 28:12.674
<i>Jim Shao says</i>

28:12.709 --> 28:14.609
<i>that all the documents</i>
<i>concern the same company:</i>

28:14.644 --> 28:17.078
a Clementine Construction.
Huh.

28:17.113 --> 28:20.315
Is that one of the clients
he tried to pawn off on Stanley?

28:20.350 --> 28:23.351
Exactly. No idea why the victim
was so interested in it, but

28:23.386 --> 28:25.520
Jim gave us the
tax I.D. number

28:25.555 --> 28:28.489
and the SBA form, so let's see
what we can dig up.

28:28.525 --> 28:31.059
Yeah, okay.

28:38.034 --> 28:40.068
You ever ride a horse, Angela?

28:40.103 --> 28:42.136
Uh... yeah, a couple times.

28:42.172 --> 28:43.838
Oh, beautiful
thing, isn't it?

28:43.873 --> 28:46.474
The communion
between man and beast,

28:46.509 --> 28:47.942
moving together as one

28:47.977 --> 28:50.978
in the fog, thick as a blanket.

28:51.014 --> 28:52.914
The sound of his breath.

28:52.949 --> 28:54.549
Maybe it's yours.

28:54.584 --> 28:57.485
Oh, hey, uh, I think
I got something here.

28:57.520 --> 28:59.620
The Social Security number

28:59.656 --> 29:01.589
on these documents-- it's fake.

29:01.624 --> 29:04.992
The person who founded the
company doesn't actually exist.

29:05.028 --> 29:08.296
Meaning Clementine
Construction is a front.

29:08.331 --> 29:10.398
But for what?

29:14.304 --> 29:16.571
Are you okay
in here, Ms. Wick?

29:16.606 --> 29:17.932
What's all this?

29:17.956 --> 29:19.875
I'm studying the frontal
bone in microslices.

29:19.876 --> 29:23.277
Lots and lots and
lots of microslices.

29:23.313 --> 29:25.413
Huh. Care to elaborate?

29:25.448 --> 29:27.014
I'm looking for trauma
that would explain

29:27.050 --> 29:28.516
the internal hemorrhaging
in the neurocranium.

29:28.551 --> 29:30.551
And I found it.
Boy, did I find it.

29:30.587 --> 29:33.087
Microfractures?
I'm so overwhelmed

29:33.123 --> 29:36.057
by the sheer number that I can't
seem to figure it out.

29:36.092 --> 29:38.626
Ask Angela for help once
she gets back from the FBI.

29:38.661 --> 29:41.929
If she scans in your data, she
might be able to use a program

29:41.965 --> 29:44.132
that could help discern
possible patterns.

29:44.167 --> 29:46.634
That's a great idea. Thank you.

29:47.837 --> 29:51.005
Dr. Saroyan, I
didn't mean to, but

29:51.040 --> 29:54.509
I heard you outside the
bone room earlier with that man.

29:54.544 --> 29:56.444
Oh. Um...

29:56.479 --> 29:59.013
that was private.
I know.

29:59.048 --> 30:02.550
And I know it's absolutely
none of my business,

30:02.585 --> 30:04.919
but I understand how hard it is

30:04.954 --> 30:08.222
to open your heart again...
after a loss.

30:08.258 --> 30:11.292
It takes time, and

30:11.327 --> 30:13.327
it takes courage,

30:13.363 --> 30:15.730
but at some point,
you have to risk it.

30:15.765 --> 30:18.199
If you don't, you just...

30:18.234 --> 30:21.235
shrink a little inside.

30:22.906 --> 30:25.907
Thank you, Daisy.

30:25.942 --> 30:29.177
That means a lot
coming from you.

30:39.622 --> 30:43.424
Nine out of 12, 23.2 seconds.

30:47.297 --> 30:48.596
Seen the scoreboard?

30:48.631 --> 30:50.798
You're tied all the way up
in tenth place.

30:50.834 --> 30:52.266
Tied with whom?

30:52.302 --> 30:53.868
That Buck fella,
believe it or not.

30:53.903 --> 30:57.004
He came out of nowhere
with his last couple of rounds.

30:58.775 --> 31:00.641
All right, Wild Card Wanda,
come on up here, girl.

31:00.677 --> 31:02.443
- You're next.
- Shot pattern

31:02.479 --> 31:03.878
is two sweeps and a loop.

31:03.913 --> 31:05.313
Ready when you are.

31:05.348 --> 31:07.381
I'm coming for you,
you mangy bunch of curs!

31:07.417 --> 31:09.750
And hell's coming with me!

31:28.505 --> 31:32.940
12 out of 12, 18.8 seconds.

31:34.344 --> 31:35.843
Think you can top that?

31:35.879 --> 31:37.712
All right.

31:41.017 --> 31:42.517
I'm coming for you,

31:42.552 --> 31:44.519
you mangy curs, and
hell's coming with me.

32:01.871 --> 32:04.539
12 out of 12, 16.7 seconds.

32:04.574 --> 32:06.440
Unbelievable! I believe

32:06.476 --> 32:08.709
that is the best we've ever seen
here at the Frontier Games.

32:08.745 --> 32:10.444
That's impossible.

32:10.480 --> 32:12.446
He's cheating.

32:12.482 --> 32:14.949
He's not.

32:17.820 --> 32:20.087
<i>Clementine Construction</i>
<i>only had</i>

32:20.123 --> 32:21.923
one client,
and guess who it was.

32:21.958 --> 32:24.125
- Frontier Games, Limited.
- Aha.

32:24.160 --> 32:25.593
I guess now we know why
Stanley was so interested.

32:25.628 --> 32:26.928
Have you talked to Booth yet?

32:26.963 --> 32:28.496
Yeah, he says
he's seen absolutely

32:28.531 --> 32:29.931
no sign of construction
anywhere on the property,

32:29.966 --> 32:31.299
but I'm headed there now.

32:31.334 --> 32:32.867
To the Frontier Games?

32:32.902 --> 32:34.635
Why? I'm sure Booth has
everything under control.

32:34.671 --> 32:36.037
I just... I got a bad feeling.

32:36.072 --> 32:37.872
I think I should be nearby.

32:37.907 --> 32:39.340
Are you sure it's not

32:39.375 --> 32:40.942
because you're a little jealous?

32:40.977 --> 32:42.543
Don't insult me, Dr. Saroyan.

32:42.579 --> 32:44.278
There is something
that we are still missing,

32:44.314 --> 32:46.414
and whatever it is
got Stanley killed.

32:46.449 --> 32:48.182
But I'll admit,

32:48.217 --> 32:51.052
I am wearing a poncho.

33:10.873 --> 33:12.673
Congratulations, Wanda.

33:12.709 --> 33:14.675
Third place.
Thank you.

33:14.711 --> 33:16.377
Yeah. Hey, I got you
a little something

33:16.412 --> 33:18.145
to remember this weekend by.
Oh.

33:18.181 --> 33:19.947
Some of the Old West.

33:19.983 --> 33:22.650
I saw how you were admiring
these when you first arrived.

33:22.685 --> 33:24.885
Painted by High
Card Luke himself.

33:24.921 --> 33:29.290
Oh, that is so thoughtful
of you. Thank you.

33:29.325 --> 33:31.292
You know, I was
thinking, um,

33:31.327 --> 33:33.594
maybe I could
call you sometime.

33:33.630 --> 33:35.363
Before you answer,

33:35.398 --> 33:37.431
I'm gonna get us some drinks.
I'll be right back.

33:42.271 --> 33:45.406
Hey, everyone. Uh, Franny
and I want to thank you all

33:45.441 --> 33:47.775
for joining us this weekend.
And now I'd like y'all

33:47.810 --> 33:50.244
to pick a partner
for this very special song.

33:50.279 --> 33:51.712
It's my husband's
favorite.

33:51.748 --> 33:54.015
And just because I can't
dance so good these days

33:54.050 --> 33:55.716
doesn't mean
you shouldn't. All right?

34:06.562 --> 34:08.696
All these paintings,
Luke did them.

34:08.731 --> 34:11.732
Well, that's great.
Well, whoever punched the victim

34:11.768 --> 34:13.701
had turpentine on his hands.

34:13.735 --> 34:15.770
Turpentine
can be used

34:15.804 --> 34:17.804
as a glazing medium
for oil paint.

34:17.840 --> 34:19.806
Wait a second. This song...

34:19.842 --> 34:22.409
It's "My Darling,
Clementine."

34:22.445 --> 34:23.710
That's it.
Clementine Construction

34:23.746 --> 34:25.045
is Luke, you understand?

34:25.081 --> 34:26.781
He was embezzling money
from his wife.

34:26.815 --> 34:29.083
Stanley must have figured it
out, threatened to expose him,

34:29.118 --> 34:30.451
Luke killed him. Let's go.

34:30.485 --> 34:32.453
Uh, we make a great team,
don't we?

34:32.487 --> 34:34.688
Still think you could take me
at target shooting?

34:34.724 --> 34:37.558
Well, with practice.
Booth, do you still think

34:37.592 --> 34:40.327
that our life together is routine?
Come on.

34:40.362 --> 34:42.429
Why would you think that?
I would never think that.

34:42.465 --> 34:43.931
Why else do you want
a motorcycle?

34:43.966 --> 34:45.966
Why do birds fly, Bones?
Because it's cool.

34:46.002 --> 34:48.436
That's not why birds fly.
Come here, you.

34:49.371 --> 34:50.571
Oh.

34:50.606 --> 34:52.139
Oh!

34:52.175 --> 34:54.909
There is a code
among cowboys, Buck!

34:54.944 --> 34:56.944
Now, I-I told you
from the start, dang it,

34:56.978 --> 34:58.446
I-I had my eyes set on Wanda.

34:58.481 --> 34:59.947
Calm down.

34:59.982 --> 35:01.415
It's not what you think.

35:01.451 --> 35:03.350
I don't need to think.
I have eyes.

35:03.386 --> 35:04.852
And I have free will,
which means

35:04.887 --> 35:06.687
you can't actually fight
over me.

35:06.723 --> 35:09.023
That's right. So just take
a step back there, Marshal.

35:09.058 --> 35:10.391
Oh, you just made
a mistake.

35:10.426 --> 35:12.059
Whoa, watch out.

35:12.095 --> 35:13.360
Uh-oh. Look out!

35:21.437 --> 35:23.037
Oh, nice one!

35:25.007 --> 35:26.640
Hey. Thanks, Bones.

35:26.676 --> 35:28.809
Aubrey, what are you doing here?
Isn't it obvious?

35:28.845 --> 35:30.511
I'm your posse!

35:38.821 --> 35:40.421
That's it!

35:40.456 --> 35:42.790
We got a
zero-tolerance policy

35:42.825 --> 35:44.725
here on fighting! I'm sorry,

35:44.761 --> 35:47.695
but, Glen, Buck,
you're both disqualified.

35:47.730 --> 35:49.764
I don't think so.
There's a new sheriff in town,

35:49.799 --> 35:51.332
and his name
is Special Agent Seeley Booth.

35:51.367 --> 35:52.833
And you're under arrest
for the murder of

35:52.869 --> 35:55.069
- Stanley Belridge.
- And I'm not Wanda.

35:55.104 --> 35:56.637
I'm Dr. Temperance Brennan.

35:56.672 --> 35:58.539
I'm also the mother
of his children.

35:58.574 --> 36:00.007
That's right.
Sorry.

36:04.847 --> 36:07.314
Does this mean that I won?

36:14.755 --> 36:17.519
Stanley figured out that you
were stealing money from Franny.

36:17.619 --> 36:19.352
You waited until you knew
that he was alone,

36:19.387 --> 36:20.920
you took his gun,
and you killed him.

36:20.956 --> 36:22.522
No, I didn't kill Stanley.

36:22.557 --> 36:24.123
I hit him. That's all.

36:24.159 --> 36:25.692
And he accused me
of some nonsense.

36:25.727 --> 36:27.527
I told him that he was
no longer welcome here.

36:27.562 --> 36:28.628
Is it true?

36:28.663 --> 36:30.363
Have you been
stealing from me?

36:32.067 --> 36:34.200
Your wife asked you
a question.

36:35.203 --> 36:37.537
I'm gonna need a lawyer.

36:43.211 --> 36:45.612
This is the victim's frontal bone.
And every single one

36:45.647 --> 36:49.182
of these spots is a microfracture?
Yeah, there are thousands.

36:49.217 --> 36:50.850
At first glance,
they appear random,

36:50.885 --> 36:52.819
but upon analysis...

36:52.854 --> 36:55.088
You can see
that they're actually arranged

36:55.123 --> 36:57.757
along overlapping lines,
each line measuring

36:57.792 --> 37:00.693
approximately five
to six centimeters in length.

37:00.729 --> 37:02.328
Meaning that the victim
was hit repeatedly in

37:02.364 --> 37:04.097
- the forehead by something.
- What about boots?

37:04.132 --> 37:06.466
Kicked in the head
with square-toed cowboy boots?

37:06.501 --> 37:08.134
Yeah. I mean, if they
were steel inside,

37:08.169 --> 37:10.536
it could definitely cause
this kind of damage.

37:10.572 --> 37:12.005
Not that a pair
of cowboy boots

37:12.040 --> 37:14.040
is gonna narrow
our suspect pool.

37:15.510 --> 37:17.343
Folks, please just...

37:17.379 --> 37:19.579
You need to get some ice on it.
I don't need ice.

37:19.614 --> 37:21.347
Booth, listen to me.
He didn't even hit me. It was...

37:21.383 --> 37:24.317
Will you look
at this?

37:24.352 --> 37:26.486
Whoa. Whoa, whoa,
whoa. Well,

37:26.521 --> 37:28.988
Francine's pretty torn up.
I don't know if she's got it

37:29.024 --> 37:30.723
in her to press charges.
We need more

37:30.759 --> 37:32.191
physical evidence.
What...

37:32.227 --> 37:33.192
what are you doing?

37:33.228 --> 37:34.627
I just thought I'd do

37:34.663 --> 37:36.496
a quick check of the perimeter.

37:36.531 --> 37:38.297
Right. For what? Come on.

37:38.333 --> 37:41.034
You're just looking for an
excuse to ride there, Ponyboy.

37:41.069 --> 37:43.436
Yeah, well, I figured while I'm here.
That text was from the lab.

37:43.471 --> 37:46.706
It seems our victim was struck
on the forehead

37:46.741 --> 37:49.809
by a heavy object 2,047 times.

37:49.844 --> 37:52.278
Okay, w-wait a second.
How is that even possible?

37:52.313 --> 37:53.913
I don't know.

37:55.216 --> 37:56.716
It was a horse.
Hmm?

37:56.751 --> 37:58.951
Booth, it was a horse. See?

37:58.987 --> 38:00.553
Stirrups-- heavy steel,

38:00.588 --> 38:02.321
wrapped with leather.
The victim

38:02.357 --> 38:05.858
wasn't moved to the dump site by car.
He was flung over

38:05.894 --> 38:07.994
the back of the horse.
That also explains

38:08.029 --> 38:10.029
the rope around the feet
and the neck trauma.

38:10.065 --> 38:13.533
The victim was draped facedown,
and then his

38:13.568 --> 38:17.770
neck and feet were tied together
around the horse's belly

38:17.806 --> 38:19.739
to secure him.
So, with every step,

38:19.774 --> 38:23.342
the victim's head was
pulled down by the rope

38:23.378 --> 38:26.479
and then slammed into
the stirrups? Ouch.

38:26.514 --> 38:29.382
Oh, here. Blood.

38:29.417 --> 38:30.950
We got him.

38:30.985 --> 38:32.018
Except there's one problem.

38:32.053 --> 38:33.119
This isn't Luke's saddle.

38:33.154 --> 38:34.387
It's Franny's saddle.

38:34.422 --> 38:36.222
But Franny can't
even ride.

38:38.159 --> 38:40.293
I think I know
what happened.

38:41.996 --> 38:43.996
<i>Look, we know</i>

38:44.032 --> 38:45.965
that you purchased a small ranch
in North Carolina.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.501
We also know that you purchased
a four-year-old American Paint,

38:48.536 --> 38:49.969
purebred horse.

38:50.004 --> 38:52.004
Yeah. So?
Both were paid for

38:52.040 --> 38:55.742
in cash, in amounts
remarkably similar

38:55.777 --> 38:58.644
to withdrawals made
from the bank account

38:58.680 --> 39:00.313
of Clementine Construction.

39:00.348 --> 39:02.615
Luke Nichols gave you the money,
didn't he?

39:02.650 --> 39:04.383
You two were having an affair.

39:04.419 --> 39:06.619
He loves me.
He only stayed with Franny

39:06.654 --> 39:08.354
'cause he didn't want
to hurt her.

39:08.389 --> 39:10.423
Also because she's rich.
Stanley knew.

39:10.458 --> 39:12.091
He threatened to tell Franny.

39:12.127 --> 39:14.160
And you weren't gonna let
that happen, were you?

39:14.195 --> 39:16.195
You didn't want Stanley
taking away the one thing

39:16.231 --> 39:17.930
that you wanted in life.

39:17.966 --> 39:19.265
Your horse.

39:22.003 --> 39:23.836
You killed Stanley.

39:30.979 --> 39:32.879
Promise me
you'll find her a good home.

39:32.914 --> 39:34.380
It'll be a lot nicer

39:34.415 --> 39:36.849
than jail, that's for sure.

39:44.125 --> 39:46.225
Hi.
Hi.

39:46.261 --> 39:47.727
I was just putting
some stuff away.

39:47.762 --> 39:49.061
I'll be ready in a second.

39:49.097 --> 39:51.164
I'm not, Angela.

39:53.735 --> 39:56.335
I-I'm not ready.

39:58.239 --> 40:00.239
Oh.

40:00.275 --> 40:01.674
Hey, here.

40:01.709 --> 40:04.410
Just sit with me
for a second.

40:08.183 --> 40:10.316
This is about us.

40:10.351 --> 40:12.185
What does that mean?

40:13.421 --> 40:15.655
I love us.

40:15.690 --> 40:17.523
So much.

40:17.559 --> 40:19.192
The three of us.

40:19.227 --> 40:22.695
We're like... a tight
little cocoon of love.

40:22.730 --> 40:25.031
Well, doesn't more kids
mean more love?

40:25.066 --> 40:27.700
Yes. Yeah. But the...

40:27.735 --> 40:29.902
a-a division starts to happen.

40:29.938 --> 40:31.838
It's a natural one.
It's a good one,

40:31.873 --> 40:35.675
where there are the parents
and there are the kids.

40:35.710 --> 40:39.312
And right now,
you know, it's-it's

40:39.347 --> 40:42.415
just you, me
and Michael Vincent,

40:42.450 --> 40:44.250
and we're just...

40:44.285 --> 40:46.118
us.

40:46.154 --> 40:49.622
And I don't...
I don't know

40:49.657 --> 40:54.060
if I'm ready yet to make room
for anyone else.

40:55.196 --> 40:56.929
I'm so sorry,
Angela.

40:56.965 --> 40:58.698
I just...

40:58.733 --> 41:01.901
I-I wanted to be honest.

41:06.741 --> 41:08.541
Hi.

41:10.078 --> 41:11.944
Hey.

41:13.481 --> 41:15.781
You want to take a walk?

41:18.620 --> 41:20.720
Yeah.

41:29.530 --> 41:31.130
<i>Hey, Bones,</i>

41:31.165 --> 41:33.532
you know what doesn't
get enough praise around here?

41:33.568 --> 41:35.134
Routine.

41:35.169 --> 41:37.169
You're making fun of me.
No, I'm not. Come on.

41:37.205 --> 41:40.306
Bath, lotion,
story, snuggles.

41:40.341 --> 41:41.908
I love it. I love routine.

41:41.943 --> 41:44.076
I'm glad.
Good.

41:44.112 --> 41:46.078
Mm-hmm.

41:46.114 --> 41:47.446
I have something for you.

41:47.482 --> 41:49.348
Something for me? Wow.
Mm-hmm.

41:49.384 --> 41:50.816
Close your eyes.
Closing eyes.

41:50.852 --> 41:52.485
It's a surprise.
You're gonna love it.

41:52.520 --> 41:54.754
Gonna love it. Okay, here we go.
Something you want.

41:54.789 --> 41:57.056
Tell me when.

41:57.091 --> 41:58.925
Okay. Tell me when I should open 'em up.
Okay. This is good.

41:58.960 --> 42:01.160
This is good. Hold on, wait.
Okay, I'm waiting.

42:01.195 --> 42:03.829
This is good... Now.
Now?

42:03.865 --> 42:05.798
Uh-huh.

42:05.833 --> 42:07.066
What's that?

42:07.101 --> 42:08.134
It's a motorcycle.

42:08.169 --> 42:09.635
No, it's not.
Yes, it is.

42:09.671 --> 42:10.937
It has a motor, and...

42:10.972 --> 42:13.472
uh, "cycle,"
from the Latin <i> cyclus,</i>

42:13.508 --> 42:16.075
or circle, can be applied to any

42:16.110 --> 42:18.778
wheeled vehicle.
You can't be serious.

42:18.813 --> 42:20.313
Yes, I... Booth,

42:20.348 --> 42:23.816
I got you a helmet, too.
See? Very cool.

42:23.851 --> 42:26.152
Listen, Bones, I...
This is... this is just...

42:26.187 --> 42:30.423
I-I mean, I really appreciate
this kind gesture and all.

42:30.458 --> 42:33.626
I mean, it's very thoughtful,
but, you know what?

42:33.661 --> 42:36.462
There's no way in hell
I am riding this

42:36.497 --> 42:38.297
or wearing that.

42:38.333 --> 42:39.598
Are you sure?
Yes,

42:39.634 --> 42:41.567
I am sure.
Well, maybe

42:41.602 --> 42:43.202
I'll keep it for myself,
you know? I mean,

42:43.237 --> 42:45.171
I did win the contest.
I deserve something special.

42:45.206 --> 42:47.540
You didn't win the contest.
I did.

42:47.575 --> 42:48.841
You were disqualified, Booth.

42:48.876 --> 42:50.409
You want to win
on a technicality?

42:50.445 --> 42:52.211
Rules are rules, Booth.
You gotta be kidding me.

42:52.246 --> 42:54.647
How do I look?
Like someone who came in third place.

42:54.682 --> 42:56.649
First place.
Okay, I'm gonna... Yeah.

42:56.684 --> 42:58.651
I don't know how to get the...
Don't crash!

42:58.686 --> 43:00.353
