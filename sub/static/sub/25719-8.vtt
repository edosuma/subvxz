WEBVTT

00:02.959 --> 00:05.222
I can't believe
no one showed.

00:05.266 --> 00:06.832
I figured there'd be
at least a few old lovers

00:06.876 --> 00:08.182
here to see her off.

00:08.225 --> 00:10.097
That's the thing
about a funeral.

00:10.140 --> 00:12.273
You only go so people
can see you came.

00:12.316 --> 00:14.362
No witnesses,
no obligation.

00:14.405 --> 00:17.452
Still, not one person?
VALERIE: I'd be upset.

00:17.495 --> 00:19.062
You'd be dead.

00:19.106 --> 00:20.846
It's hopeful
you think that matters.

00:20.890 --> 00:23.066
-Maybe she's the last one left
and the important people

00:23.110 --> 00:24.589
in her life are already gone.

00:24.633 --> 00:26.330
-Waiting for her
in crystal hell

00:26.374 --> 00:28.767
with their
flaming muumuus and sage.

00:28.811 --> 00:31.640
Shall we pay our respects?

00:31.683 --> 00:33.990
-Or we could leave
and go get tacos.

00:36.993 --> 00:39.865
Fine, respects first,
then tacos.

00:45.958 --> 00:47.525
Or falafel.

00:54.576 --> 00:56.752
I wonder what she
was thinking when she went.

00:56.795 --> 00:58.623
-Maybe about how her children
were gonna come see her

00:58.667 --> 01:00.277
and then never did.

01:00.321 --> 01:01.931
Can you not?

01:01.974 --> 01:03.846
Just saying.

01:03.889 --> 01:05.674
She's probably gonna hold that
over us for the rest of time,

01:05.717 --> 01:07.632
like a really boring remake
of "The Grudge"

01:07.676 --> 01:10.200
starring
Sarah Michelle Gellar.

01:10.244 --> 01:13.116
-Whatever happened
to Sarah Michelle Gellar?

01:13.160 --> 01:15.423
-You know, I don't know,
but I really like her.

01:15.466 --> 01:16.989
It's a shame we don't
see more of her.

01:18.948 --> 01:22.343
-Darlings,
so good of you to come.

01:22.386 --> 01:25.607
I was worried it would just
be me all alone with her.

01:25.650 --> 01:28.479
It's a mother's worst fear.
-Hi, Mom.

01:30.481 --> 01:33.615
How does she look

01:33.658 --> 01:36.357
 It's always so hard to tell.

01:36.400 --> 01:39.142
But I'm sure her spirit
is overjoyed that you came.

01:39.186 --> 01:42.493
Couldn't have been easy,
dying alone in that house.

01:42.537 --> 01:44.887
But I suppose that's
how she chose to live.

01:44.930 --> 01:49.109
There's a symmetry in that.
Life's poetic stanza.

01:51.502 --> 01:53.330
Did someone say
we're getting falafel?

01:53.374 --> 01:54.505
Oh, fuck yeah.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.074

02:12.567 --> 02:15.178
Oh.
What you doing, sweetheart?

02:19.226 --> 02:21.053
-Hi.
-Hey.

02:21.097 --> 02:24.970
-Hi, Care Bear.
-Hi, Mommy.

02:25.014 --> 02:27.190
Oh.
RAE: How you doing?

02:27.234 --> 02:28.931
I'm okay.

02:28.974 --> 02:31.107
-Do you want me to change
my flight to next week?

02:31.151 --> 02:32.587
-No.
-'Cause I can.

02:32.630 --> 02:34.197
Whatever you need.
-Nope, you gotta go.

02:34.241 --> 02:35.720
They can't make
that movie without you.

02:35.764 --> 02:37.766
-Yeah, they--they can.
Seriously.

02:37.809 --> 02:40.725
-Rae, I'm good.
If anything, I'm relieved.

02:40.769 --> 02:42.640
-You sure?
-Yeah.

02:42.684 --> 02:44.512
A small part of me believed
she'd made a Faustian bargain

02:44.555 --> 02:46.949
and would live forever.
-Her soul's safe.

02:46.992 --> 02:48.646
I wouldn't go that far.

02:49.473 --> 02:51.519
-Hey, I gotta be
at the airport super early

02:51.562 --> 02:53.303
tomorrow morning, and I was
wondering if I could just

02:53.347 --> 02:55.523
bring Carrie back tonight
and put her down.

02:55.566 --> 02:57.525
-Great, yeah.
-Okay.

02:59.527 --> 03:01.181
-Do you wanna stay
for breakfast?

03:49.881 --> 03:53.058
-It's a dinosaur!
-It is a dinosaur.

03:53.102 --> 03:55.409
-He used to be the breakfast
king, your dad.

03:55.452 --> 03:58.150
He made the best waffles
on the planet.

03:58.194 --> 03:59.848
And then he sold out.

03:59.891 --> 04:02.416
-I adjusted my identity
for the amusement of my child,

04:02.459 --> 04:03.982
thank you very much.
-He sold out big-time.

04:04.026 --> 04:05.288
Hmm.

04:05.332 --> 04:06.376
-Hey, uh, the realtor's
checking in.

04:06.420 --> 04:08.160
Did you call her?
-I will.

04:08.204 --> 04:09.684
Dude.

04:09.727 --> 04:10.815
-There's no shortage
of housing in Texas.

04:10.859 --> 04:12.339
I'm unconcerned.

04:12.382 --> 04:14.123
-Okay, well, you're not
sleeping on my couch.

04:14.166 --> 04:16.212
-Jeff said I could.
-He definitely did not.

04:16.255 --> 04:17.344
-Oh, come on.
Too soon?

04:17.387 --> 04:20.129
Just call her, please.

04:20.172 --> 04:22.958
Hey, what's up with you?

04:23.001 --> 04:24.655
You don't like my pancakes
either?

04:26.309 --> 04:28.703
-I had the dream again.
-Oy.

04:28.746 --> 04:30.226
It's a lot, right?

04:30.270 --> 04:32.054
Funeral dream
same day as a funeral?

04:32.097 --> 04:34.230
-Eh, I've had so many
dreams about Dad,

04:34.274 --> 04:37.146
my subconscious has basically
given up on generating story.

04:37.189 --> 04:38.800
-We were especially bad
in this one.

04:38.843 --> 04:40.454
Huh.

04:40.497 --> 04:42.412
-And one day, it's gonna be me
in that coffin,

04:42.456 --> 04:45.328
and I don't think I want people
cracking jokes at my expense.

04:45.372 --> 04:46.808
-I don't like
where this is headed.

04:46.851 --> 04:49.506
-Can we just try
to be respectful today?

04:49.550 --> 04:51.813
It's kind of the last big one.

04:51.856 --> 04:54.381
-I'll put on a suit.
-Thank you.

05:00.387 --> 05:02.302
Hey, Valerie.
-Hi, Leon.

05:02.345 --> 05:03.607
Hey, bud.

05:14.923 --> 05:18.709
-This is nice.
-Yeah, well attended.

05:18.753 --> 05:21.451
-Your mother
was a wonderful woman.

05:21.495 --> 05:23.975
-Oh, thank you.
That's very kind of you to say.

05:24.019 --> 05:25.542
So full of love.

05:25.586 --> 05:27.631
-I'm gonna choose
to remember her that way.

05:27.675 --> 05:32.375
-We made love on occasion.
-Oh, that's good.

05:32.419 --> 05:34.769
-It was.
It was very good.

05:34.812 --> 05:36.727
Well, I'm going
to join my husband.

05:36.771 --> 05:38.642
Mm-hmm.
-Wonderful service.

05:38.686 --> 05:41.384
The bagels were a nice touch.

05:41.428 --> 05:43.995
But one of the toasters
is broken.

05:44.039 --> 05:45.649
-Okay.
-Noted.

05:48.652 --> 05:51.351
-Don't.
-I didn't say anything.

05:51.394 --> 05:53.440
-You either.
-No, not a peep.

05:53.483 --> 05:55.093
-Everyone.
-Hmm?

05:55.137 --> 05:58.140
-Take a crystal.
These were her favorite.

05:58.183 --> 06:01.796
Good for digestion
and blood pressure.

06:01.839 --> 06:05.016
Bring them home.
Cherish them.

06:05.060 --> 06:06.583
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

06:06.627 --> 06:08.629
Goddess bless.

06:10.021 --> 06:11.545
-One of the toasters
is broken?

06:13.808 --> 06:16.854
Oh, my God.

06:23.600 --> 06:24.993
Alex, no.

06:25.036 --> 06:26.298
Oh, my God,
are people looking?

06:26.342 --> 06:28.344
No. Yes.
ALEX: Okay.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.911
-Everyone's looking.
-Okay, come on.

06:29.954 --> 06:31.391
-Shh.
-Come on, get it together.

06:31.434 --> 06:33.436
-Is somebody gonna
say something?

06:39.442 --> 06:41.401
Okay. Okay.
-Oh, no, this is so bad.

06:41.444 --> 06:43.490
We have to--

06:43.533 --> 06:45.100
-My face hurts.
-We're just--

06:45.143 --> 06:46.449
We're just gonna go--
Shut up. We're going to--

06:46.493 --> 06:48.146
We have to go up
to the body.

06:48.190 --> 06:49.844
-Okay, bring your crystal.
-This is gonna stop.

07:13.911 --> 07:15.870
Hi, Grandma.

07:15.913 --> 07:18.002
We had some
good times together.

07:18.046 --> 07:21.528
And if there's a party
after this one,

07:21.571 --> 07:24.008
I'm sure you'll be
the life of it.

07:24.052 --> 07:27.098
Sorry, I hope that
wasn't weird.

07:28.578 --> 07:31.363
Bye, Mom.

07:31.407 --> 07:33.844
You'll always be with us,
no matter where we are,

07:33.888 --> 07:35.890
what we do.

07:35.933 --> 07:38.806
She bound us.

07:38.849 --> 07:40.460
So thank you for that.

07:42.766 --> 07:45.247
Bon voyage.

07:45.290 --> 07:47.554
See you on the other side.

07:50.644 --> 07:53.124
Excuse me.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.781
Shall we?

08:11.186 --> 08:12.927
-Please don't take her to,
like, Canada

08:12.970 --> 08:15.625
and change your number.

08:15.669 --> 08:18.541
-You'd find me.
-I would.

08:18.585 --> 08:20.282
Don't worry.

08:20.325 --> 08:22.589
Be with you in Austin
before you know it.

08:27.245 --> 08:28.986
-Are you guys
doing anything tonight?

08:33.687 --> 08:35.602
-You know, I don't want
to question your instincts,

08:35.645 --> 08:40.258
but even for you,
this feels a bit much.

08:40.302 --> 08:42.739
-What better way to celebrate
Mom's life than by having sex

08:42.783 --> 08:45.176
with people we barely know?

08:45.220 --> 08:49.006
Well, is this about Rae?
-Nope.

08:49.050 --> 08:50.834
-'Cause it's okay if it is.
-It's not.

08:50.878 --> 08:53.750
-All right.
-Rae and I will be fine.

08:53.794 --> 08:56.405
'Cause that's what
we have to be.

08:56.448 --> 08:58.494
Now, can we just go out
and have a good time?

08:58.538 --> 09:00.844
-When is the last time
you were on a proper date?

09:00.888 --> 09:02.977
Define proper.

09:03.020 --> 09:04.413
I hope you still got it.

09:05.849 --> 09:08.156
-Oh, I still got it.
Do you still got it?

09:08.199 --> 09:10.245
Oh, I never lost it.

09:10.288 --> 09:13.291
-You totally epically lost it
for a period of multiple years.

09:13.335 --> 09:14.858
-Well, I got it back.
-Mm-hmm.

09:14.902 --> 09:16.643
-Asshole.

09:16.686 --> 09:19.515
Okay, bye-bye.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.343
-She's already down,
so it should be smooth sailing.

09:21.386 --> 09:22.910
Okay.

09:22.953 --> 09:25.303
-But if she wakes up,
read her a bedtime story.

09:25.347 --> 09:27.741
Okay.
-It's important.

09:27.784 --> 09:29.525
Her brain is a rapidly
developing sponge.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.092
I'm trying to fill it
with wonder and imagination

09:31.135 --> 09:33.094
and love for the arts,
so don't forget that--

09:33.137 --> 09:35.618
-Alex.
-Sorry.

09:35.662 --> 09:37.402
Thank you for babysitting.
-Go on.

09:37.446 --> 09:39.448
-Love you.
-Love you too.

09:39.491 --> 09:40.667
Bye.

09:44.409 --> 09:48.805
-Uh, well...

09:48.849 --> 09:50.894
-We're orphans now.
-That's true.

09:50.938 --> 09:52.635
-Mmm.

09:54.028 --> 09:55.638
-I guess if we were
in a book,

09:55.682 --> 09:59.033
we'd be starting some
crazy adventure, right?

09:59.076 --> 10:00.600
Like--I don't know--

10:00.643 --> 10:04.560
facing an evil governess...
or Voldemort.

10:04.604 --> 10:05.953
That'd be cool.

10:05.996 --> 10:07.519
-Book orphans
have it really rough.

10:07.563 --> 10:09.304
I guess real orphans do too.

10:11.088 --> 10:12.568
-I wonder what
our adventure will be.

10:12.612 --> 10:16.964
-Hmm.
I'm gonna miss this.

10:17.007 --> 10:20.010
Me too.

10:20.054 --> 10:22.709
Okay, so what's the plan?

10:22.752 --> 10:24.232
What do you mean

10:24.275 --> 10:25.407
-What if one of our dates
is really good

10:25.450 --> 10:27.322
and the other one sucks?

10:27.365 --> 10:28.932
Is it every man for himself,
or is it no person left behind?

10:28.976 --> 10:30.673
I mean, what is--

10:30.717 --> 10:32.457
-Well, I don't know which
military policy applies

10:32.501 --> 10:34.764
to this situation,
so how about we play it by ear?

10:34.808 --> 10:36.070
Okay.

10:36.113 --> 10:38.376
So who are these people,
anyway?

10:38.420 --> 10:40.161
Thank you for asking.

10:40.204 --> 10:45.296
Mine is Taylor.
35, works in private equity.

10:45.340 --> 10:48.517
Scroll forward, please.
Yours is Michael.

10:48.560 --> 10:51.738
47, nutritionist.

10:51.781 --> 10:54.479
-Handsome devil.
-Nutritionist.

10:54.523 --> 10:56.046
-All right.
Where are they?

10:56.090 --> 10:57.265
'Cause we should make sure
to sit where we

10:57.308 --> 10:59.310
can see each other.

11:04.185 --> 11:05.273
-I don't think
that's gonna be an issue.

11:05.316 --> 11:06.709
-No.
-After you.

11:06.753 --> 11:09.669
-Okay.
Have fun.

11:18.939 --> 11:20.462
-Hi.
-Hey.

11:22.551 --> 11:25.293
-How was it?
-It was nice.

11:25.336 --> 11:27.121
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

11:27.164 --> 11:29.427
Any good outfits?

11:29.471 --> 11:32.430
-Uh, there were some
interpretive dancers.

11:32.474 --> 11:35.259
-Ooh.
-It's good to see you.

11:35.303 --> 11:37.000
You too.

11:40.874 --> 11:45.356
-"Sometimes it feels impossible
that I could ever do

11:45.400 --> 11:49.665
anything that's great at all
until I talk to you."

12:00.807 --> 12:04.549
-Her room is so cute.
-Oh, yeah.

12:04.593 --> 12:07.814
It's not quite the same
as when I lived here.

12:07.857 --> 12:10.860
I wish I'd known you then.

12:10.904 --> 12:13.863
I was an angsty little loner.

12:13.907 --> 12:15.909
A lot of attitude
and no friends.

12:15.952 --> 12:18.259
-You?
-I know.

12:19.782 --> 12:24.656
-And now this place
is going away.

12:24.700 --> 12:30.184
And it's like once they change
the locks and repaint,

12:30.227 --> 12:33.056
that part of me
disappears forever.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.146
You wish.

12:39.846 --> 12:43.893
Sorry I've been
existing in the digital space.

12:43.937 --> 12:48.376
But with Alex leaving
and the funeral, you know.

12:48.419 --> 12:49.856
Mm-hmm.

12:49.899 --> 12:53.294
-It's nice to finally
see you in person.

12:53.337 --> 12:54.556
It's okay.

12:54.599 --> 12:56.776
I mean,
I figured you were busy.

12:56.819 --> 13:00.083
-Well, I'm unemployed,
living in my mom's house.

13:00.127 --> 13:02.694
It's a nonstop thrill ride.

13:06.046 --> 13:08.788
So what do you wanna
do tonight?

13:08.831 --> 13:12.226
-I wanna crank the hot tub
up to 103 degrees and soak.

13:12.269 --> 13:15.142
But I realize you might
be more comfortable

13:15.185 --> 13:18.319
doing clothed activities.

13:18.362 --> 13:20.887
I could soak.

13:20.930 --> 13:22.366
You know, in all honesty--

13:22.410 --> 13:25.717
and this is gonna sound
really terrible,

13:25.761 --> 13:28.503
but I'm kind of
in the dating sweet spot,

13:28.546 --> 13:32.942
and what I mean is,
I'm 45, I'm divorced,

13:32.986 --> 13:34.683
my kid is grown up.

13:34.726 --> 13:36.685
If I wanna have a relationship,
I can do that.

13:36.728 --> 13:40.254
If I--if it's just sex, say,
there's options there.

13:40.297 --> 13:42.473
If I wanna be alone, eh,
that's okay too.

13:42.517 --> 13:44.606
That sounds pretty ideal.

13:44.649 --> 13:47.609
-It is, and it took me
a very long time to realize

13:47.652 --> 13:51.613
that you can just--you can just
ask for what you want.

13:51.656 --> 13:54.790
I used to be so afraid
of being alone.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.705
Thought I had this
blinking sign over my head

13:56.748 --> 13:58.838
that just said,
"She's alone, she's alone."

14:00.448 --> 14:02.363
-And the truth is,
I think people are just

14:02.406 --> 14:05.409
way too concerned about their
own signs to even notice yours.

14:05.453 --> 14:07.890
-So you didn't see my sign?
-No.

14:07.934 --> 14:09.979
-It's pink neon,
and it's blinking,

14:10.023 --> 14:12.416
"Stop sweating, stop sweating."

14:14.462 --> 14:15.898
Were you close to her?

14:15.942 --> 14:17.160
-Well, she left me
as an infant

14:17.204 --> 14:18.727
to go on tour with Queen,

14:18.770 --> 14:20.860
so if that tells you anything.
-Queen?

14:20.903 --> 14:23.471
-I know, it's weird.
My mom was weird.

14:23.514 --> 14:25.821
Who goes on tour with Queen?

14:25.865 --> 14:27.170
-I don't know.
In the '70s, I bet lots

14:27.214 --> 14:28.737
of people went on tour
with Queen.

14:28.780 --> 14:30.521
-You sure it wasn't, like,
Kiss or AC/DC?

14:30.565 --> 14:32.349
'Cause that I would understand.

14:32.393 --> 14:33.829
-Pretty sure I know which band
my mom was touring with

14:33.873 --> 14:35.439
in my infancy.

14:35.483 --> 14:36.832
-You're pretty sure
of something that happened

14:36.876 --> 14:39.226
in your infancy?
-We could Google it.

14:39.269 --> 14:41.489
Should we Google it?
-No, of course not.

14:41.532 --> 14:44.405
Sorry, Queen's great.
-They're fine.

14:44.448 --> 14:46.146
Do you have any pictures?

14:46.189 --> 14:48.670
I'd bet there are
some fun pictures.

14:48.713 --> 14:52.239
-No, she didn't
take any pictures.

14:52.282 --> 14:53.849
Okay.

14:55.329 --> 14:57.374
-You really don't believe me.
-I believe you.

14:57.418 --> 14:59.159
-No, you don't,
and I don't have any pictures,

14:59.202 --> 15:01.030
so now it seems like
I'm the crazy one.

15:01.074 --> 15:03.337
-Did I seem like the crazy one
before you didn't have

15:03.380 --> 15:06.644
any pictures of your mom's
groupie tour?

15:06.688 --> 15:08.298
-Will you excuse me
for a second?

15:22.704 --> 15:24.619
I stopped seeing Estelle.

15:24.662 --> 15:26.664
No names, please.

15:30.016 --> 15:32.844
What happened?

15:32.888 --> 15:36.848
-We just ran out of things
to talk about.

15:36.892 --> 15:40.374
-Yeah, well, there are only
so many topics.

15:47.555 --> 15:50.514
Have you been going out

15:50.558 --> 15:54.388
-Yeah.
-No.

15:54.431 --> 15:58.087
See, I had this ex-girlfriend,
and she's been pretty hard

15:58.131 --> 15:59.523
to measure up to.

16:08.706 --> 16:12.275
-I think I'm done
seeing other people.

16:14.538 --> 16:16.758
-Okay.
-Okay?

16:16.801 --> 16:19.587
-Yeah.
Okay.

16:19.630 --> 16:22.982
 What?

16:23.025 --> 16:24.548
Never mind.

16:24.592 --> 16:26.898
-Was there something else
you wanted to say?

16:26.942 --> 16:28.291
Nope.

16:28.335 --> 16:30.293
-Kind of feels like
there might be.

16:30.337 --> 16:32.643
-You're really enjoying this,
aren't you?

16:32.687 --> 16:35.951
-Do you want me
to be your girlfriend?

16:35.995 --> 16:39.650
-No.
-Are you sure?

16:39.694 --> 16:42.610
Maybe.

17:01.063 --> 17:04.848
-Hey, how is he?
-Uh, I like him.

17:04.893 --> 17:07.722
He's educated and funny
and has great skin.

17:07.765 --> 17:09.157
-Nutritionist.
-Yeah.

17:09.202 --> 17:11.073
What's wrong?
You seem very agitated.

17:11.117 --> 17:12.596
-Mine doesn't believe me
that Mom went on tour with Queen

17:12.640 --> 17:14.119
when I was born.

17:14.163 --> 17:15.730
-What do you mean
she doesn't believe it?

17:15.772 --> 17:17.384
-She thinks that Queen
is an unlikely band.

17:17.426 --> 17:19.342
-Yeah, well, everything
about Mom was unlikely.

17:19.386 --> 17:21.040
I know, exactly.

17:21.083 --> 17:22.519
I was willing to put up
with this private equity

17:22.563 --> 17:24.781
money fetish thing,
but I don't know.

17:24.826 --> 17:26.784
This seems like
a bridge too far.

17:26.828 --> 17:28.221
Seriously?

17:28.263 --> 17:29.744
This is where
we're drawing the line?

17:29.787 --> 17:31.267
-Yeah, it feels combative.
-Who cares?

17:31.311 --> 17:32.312
'Cause you're never
gonna see her again.

17:32.355 --> 17:33.835
You're moving.

17:33.878 --> 17:35.097
-She might visit Austin
and have to choose

17:35.141 --> 17:36.533
between me and a cheesy hotel.

17:36.577 --> 17:38.274
I could be her mistake
of convenience.

17:38.318 --> 17:39.710
-Mm, that's probably
gonna happen.

17:39.754 --> 17:40.798
-Austin is--
-Oh, God, not again.

17:40.842 --> 17:42.061
What?

17:42.104 --> 17:43.845
Hi.

17:43.888 --> 17:45.542
What's all this?

17:45.586 --> 17:48.284
-Um, this is probably
gonna sound a little weird,

17:48.328 --> 17:49.764
but, um--

17:49.807 --> 17:51.418
-She's my sister
and my best friend.

17:51.461 --> 17:52.984
And I don't think you're crazy.

17:53.028 --> 17:54.812
I just want you to believe me
about Queen.

17:54.856 --> 17:57.163
-This is why you keep glancing
at the table next to us?

17:57.206 --> 17:58.642
Yeah.

17:58.686 --> 18:01.036
If her date sucks,
I might need to step in.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.995
And given his level of fitness,
probably get my ass kicked.

18:04.039 --> 18:05.954
Yeah.
-Does he suck?

18:05.997 --> 18:08.130
Great.

18:08.174 --> 18:10.001
Can we all sit together
like normal people

18:10.045 --> 18:12.003
instead of hiding out
by the bathroom?

18:12.047 --> 18:15.224
-Absolutely.
-Sure, sounds good.

18:15.268 --> 18:17.357
Thank you.

18:18.749 --> 18:20.490
-Never mind.
I like her.

18:54.002 --> 18:58.006
And just complain

18:58.049 --> 19:02.532
You had your time

19:02.576 --> 19:06.493
You've yet to have

19:10.845 --> 19:13.195
Thank you.

19:55.368 --> 19:59.633
-Holy shit, you're alive.
-It's good to see you too.

19:59.676 --> 20:01.591
-Are you here to burn
this place down?

20:01.635 --> 20:03.027
Do you need any help?
I can help you.

20:03.071 --> 20:04.768
-No, actually.
Way more pathetic.

20:04.812 --> 20:07.771
I've come to beg at the altar
of unemployment.

20:07.815 --> 20:10.078
-Gross, don't do that.
-No, oh, God, no. It's fine.

20:10.121 --> 20:13.081
My pride is swallowed
and digested.

20:13.124 --> 20:14.778
-No, I mean,
this place is over.

20:14.822 --> 20:16.998
It's an exodus.
Pharaoh's lost control.

20:17.041 --> 20:20.001
-Shit.
God, I was ready to grovel.

20:20.044 --> 20:21.655
-Oh, you should come
work with me.

20:21.698 --> 20:23.309
I'm gonna go to the new
restaurant on Hyperion,

20:23.352 --> 20:25.572
and they're looking
for young people to exploit.

20:25.615 --> 20:27.487
-Seriously?
-Yeah, I could put a word in.

20:27.530 --> 20:30.925
It's the least I could do after
setting you up with Camilla.

20:30.968 --> 20:32.492
Yeah, you did do that.

20:32.535 --> 20:35.582
-But you can't walk out
mid-shift.

20:35.625 --> 20:39.281
And you have to get better
at hanging out, you bad friend.

20:39.325 --> 20:43.329
-I'll be better.
-You'd better be better.

20:43.372 --> 20:45.940
How's bow girl?
-She's off the bows.

20:45.983 --> 20:47.333
-Oh, thank God.
-Yeah.

20:47.376 --> 20:49.465
-Good.
It's good to see you.

20:49.509 --> 20:50.858
-Yeah.
-I gotta go.

20:50.901 --> 20:52.512
Ooh, one more week
of this shit.

20:52.555 --> 20:54.949
Let my people go.

21:07.918 --> 21:11.226
-This is not a baby-to-dog
replacement situation.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.097
I promise.

21:13.141 --> 21:17.537
But he's a year and a half old,
and he's black,

21:17.580 --> 21:19.669
and those dogs
don't get adopted,

21:19.713 --> 21:21.976
and it's so messed up
that racism extends to dogs,

21:22.019 --> 21:24.326
but that's the world
we live in.

21:24.370 --> 21:26.937
And he's so cute,

21:26.981 --> 21:29.288
and I think we'll love him.

21:29.331 --> 21:30.811
But I'll take him back

21:30.854 --> 21:32.247
if you don't want him.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.553
It's fine.

21:33.596 --> 21:37.513
I just want you to be happy.

21:40.081 --> 21:41.561
Okay?

21:46.043 --> 21:48.785
What's his name?

21:48.829 --> 21:50.744
Whatever we want it to be.

22:08.718 --> 22:10.894
-Mother.
-Daughter.

22:10.938 --> 22:13.375
-Living the dream, huh?
-Yes.

22:15.246 --> 22:17.336
Wanna know a secret

22:17.379 --> 22:18.902
-I've had a steady buzz
since noon.

22:20.469 --> 22:21.992
I'm so happy for you.

22:22.036 --> 22:23.211
Cheers.
-Cheers.

22:25.648 --> 22:30.218
Mm, hey, what is that?

22:30.261 --> 22:31.959
-My couch.
Do you like it?

22:32.002 --> 22:33.700
I got it on Craigslist.

22:33.743 --> 22:37.225
-I like that you have
a white couch in a wine store,

22:37.268 --> 22:39.967
you badass.
-I know, 'cause you know me.

22:40.010 --> 22:41.882
I live on the fucking edge.

22:43.492 --> 22:45.233
Hey, do you have plans
for dinner?

22:45.276 --> 22:47.322
Oh, I'm going to Alex's.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.411
-What a jerk.
He didn't ask me.

22:49.455 --> 22:51.500
-Well, I think
he's a little distracted.

22:51.544 --> 22:52.980
Mm.

22:57.463 --> 22:59.508
What

22:59.552 --> 23:02.859
-Nothing.
You just seem good.

23:04.295 --> 23:07.168
So do you.

23:07.211 --> 23:08.474
Yeah.

23:16.264 --> 23:18.701
Hey, is that you?
VALERIE: Yep.

23:18.745 --> 23:21.487
-So I got, uh, enchiladas.
-Ooh.

23:21.530 --> 23:24.054
-Carnitas, al pastor,
lenguas, suizas, mole.

23:24.098 --> 23:25.491
The whole enchilada family.

23:25.534 --> 23:28.537
-Oh, fuck yes!
-Right?

23:28.581 --> 23:29.843
Brilliant.

23:29.886 --> 23:31.932
-How great was
the other night?

23:31.975 --> 23:34.717
-God, it was so good.
-I know.

23:34.761 --> 23:36.327
-Nutritionist.
-Right?

23:36.371 --> 23:38.068
-Yeah.
-And that private equity lady,

23:38.112 --> 23:39.505
surprisingly unselfish
in bed.

23:39.548 --> 23:41.202
Oh, well, cheers.

23:41.245 --> 23:43.987
-I imagine you'll want these.
-Mm-hmm.

23:44.031 --> 23:45.859
-We gotta do it more often.
-Mm, yeah, mm-hmm.

23:45.902 --> 23:47.426
-We could hit
every karaoke bar

23:47.469 --> 23:50.037
in a ten-mile radius,
you know?

23:50.080 --> 23:51.821
Have you ever done K-Town?
I wanna do K-Town.

23:51.865 --> 23:54.345
I hear great things
about K-Town.

23:54.389 --> 23:55.608
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, never better.

23:55.651 --> 23:57.131
Okay.

23:57.174 --> 24:00.047
-So, um, I think I'm gonna
stay here in LA.

24:00.090 --> 24:02.484
Which sounds crazy, I know,
but it'll actually work out well

24:02.528 --> 24:04.486
for both of us.
You can move back in.

24:04.530 --> 24:06.183
Save money for the store.

24:06.227 --> 24:07.881
I can commute to Austin
when I have to.

24:07.924 --> 24:10.274
Carrie can split time.
Maybe do summers here.

24:10.318 --> 24:12.233
It'll be great.
-You're serious?

24:12.276 --> 24:14.017
-Yeah, people do it
all the time.

24:14.061 --> 24:16.019
I mean, my friends are here.
My work's here.

24:16.063 --> 24:19.109
-You work from home.
-And you, you're here.

24:19.153 --> 24:21.547
Who else am I gonna
laugh with at funerals

24:21.590 --> 24:24.419
or scheme with
outside of bathrooms?

24:24.463 --> 24:26.508
I mean, we're orphans now,
right?

24:26.552 --> 24:28.423
And orphans don't--
don't just leave each other.

24:28.467 --> 24:29.816
That manuscript would get
rejected out of hand.

24:29.859 --> 24:31.339
Alex--

24:31.382 --> 24:33.210
-I don't wanna go
somewhere you're not.

24:33.254 --> 24:34.516
I don't wanna start over.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.823
-Alex, you're not
starting over.

24:36.866 --> 24:38.912
Okay?
You're just--you're not.

24:38.955 --> 24:42.393
You've got Carrie.
You've got Rae.

24:42.437 --> 24:44.483
You've got your family.

24:46.572 --> 24:48.530
And Austin is so close.

24:48.574 --> 24:52.142
I'm, like--I'm so close,
and I can come visit you.

24:52.186 --> 24:55.450
And we can go line dancing.
-You're a terrible dancer.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.931
-So teach me.
-I'm afraid, Val.

24:57.974 --> 25:00.455
I'm afraid, and I'm sad.

25:00.499 --> 25:03.110
It's the end of something
I never wanna end.

25:03.153 --> 25:05.199
Alex.

25:07.114 --> 25:08.811
But it's not the end.

25:27.961 --> 25:29.571
-Okay?
-Okay.

25:29.615 --> 25:31.051
It's not the end.

25:39.929 --> 25:42.497
Oh, fuck.

25:48.590 --> 25:50.287
-Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

25:50.331 --> 25:51.985
-Okay, okay,
right behind you.

26:04.824 --> 26:07.217
-For you.
-I don't want this.

26:07.261 --> 26:09.480
-Yes, you do.
I already set it up.

26:09.524 --> 26:12.658
And, uh, I put a mix on it.
You ready, monkey?

26:12.701 --> 26:13.659
-Yes.
-Yeah.

26:13.702 --> 26:14.660
Okay.

26:14.703 --> 26:16.662
Hey, listen.

26:18.925 --> 26:20.622
You take care of him for me,
okay?

26:20.666 --> 26:22.668
Okay.

26:22.711 --> 26:24.060
Here they come.

26:24.104 --> 26:26.454
-Sorry, sorry.
-Sorry.

26:26.497 --> 26:27.586
We're here. Hi!

26:27.629 --> 26:29.936
-Hi.
-Hi.

26:31.981 --> 26:35.376
-Better late than never.
-Get a waffle iron.

26:35.419 --> 26:37.552
-I will.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.293
I'll see you soon.
LAURA: Mm.

26:45.995 --> 26:48.432
-Call you as soon as I get in.
-Please don't.

26:51.392 --> 26:54.003
-We named our dog Alex.
After you.

26:55.701 --> 26:58.747
-Well, I'm honored.
And slightly offended.

27:00.575 --> 27:02.055
Please come visit me.

27:03.447 --> 27:05.841
Okay, we gotta go.

27:07.887 --> 27:11.194
Come on.
Let's go.

27:27.863 --> 27:29.952
-Well, fuck.
-Yeah.

27:47.796 --> 27:49.189
You ready?

27:50.712 --> 27:51.974
Yeah.

28:16.912 --> 28:19.915
-Are you excited?
-Yes.

28:22.396 --> 28:23.789
Me too.

28:39.848 --> 28:41.807
-So...
-Hmm?

28:41.850 --> 28:45.201
Austin, huh?

28:45.245 --> 28:48.117
Hmm, okay.
-Okay.

28:48.161 --> 28:50.641
-Should we have some music?
-Yeah.

28:50.685 --> 28:53.079
Yes.

30:08.632 --> 30:10.112
Ova.

30:10.156 --> 30:11.853
Play Alex's mix.
