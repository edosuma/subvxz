00:01.704 --> 00:02.703
Previously on The Secret Life
of the American Teenager...

00:02.705 --> 00:04.471
Is your mother coming over?

00:04.507 --> 00:05.607
It's time for her to go.

00:05.641 --> 00:07.742
Amy is going to summer school in New York?

00:07.777 --> 00:10.378
You can make the decision as
to where you're gonna live.

00:10.413 --> 00:11.613
Don't forget, I'm paying for it.

00:11.647 --> 00:14.315
So you and some woman

00:14.350 --> 00:15.817
picked out a place for you and me?

00:15.851 --> 00:18.520
I might be interested in buying out
your share of the furniture store.

00:18.554 --> 00:19.688
I want a clean break.

00:19.722 --> 00:20.689
I don't want to be tangled
up with you anymore.

00:20.723 --> 00:23.358
I just want to know where we stand.

00:23.392 --> 00:24.392
Goodnight and goodbye.

00:24.427 --> 00:26.728
I hope we can still be...

00:26.762 --> 00:29.497
I can make you forget
all about Amy Juergens.

00:29.532 --> 00:31.299
Don't go back there.

00:31.333 --> 00:33.435
I want to marry you and I want
to sleep with you right now.

00:33.469 --> 00:34.769
Maybe I'm anxious about
getting married because

00:34.804 --> 00:36.604
I'm nervous about sleeping with you again.

00:36.639 --> 00:39.474
I want to get married
the day after I graduate.

00:39.508 --> 00:42.410
Thank you, Kathleen, for
inviting me to stay here

00:42.445 --> 00:44.612
and for allowing me to be
a part of your new life.

00:44.647 --> 00:46.347
I can't talk to my mother about this.

00:46.382 --> 00:48.416
- I can't tell her I slept with Jack.
- We'll get together.

00:48.451 --> 00:50.485
I think we should ask Amy
if she wants to join us.

00:50.519 --> 00:51.553
Oh. Hi, Anne.

00:51.587 --> 00:52.787
Hi.

00:52.822 --> 00:54.723
I couldn't tell you why I
didn't want to be with you.

00:54.757 --> 00:56.591
Hey, it's me. Ginger.

00:56.625 --> 00:57.726
I knew you'd call me, toots.

01:00.563 --> 01:02.564
I don't even want to graduate,

01:02.598 --> 01:04.232
I don't want to go to college,

01:04.266 --> 01:06.568
at least not any college around here.

01:06.602 --> 01:09.437
And what's wrong with
the colleges around here?

01:09.472 --> 01:11.372
It's not exactly easy
to get into the college

01:11.407 --> 01:13.374
where Ricky and Jack and I go to, you know.

01:13.409 --> 01:15.343
It's a very good school.

01:15.377 --> 01:18.680
It's not exactly Harvard. I can't
believe Grant got into Harvard.

01:18.714 --> 01:20.381
Grace, you just have to get over that,

01:20.416 --> 01:22.283
you got into a half-dozen
schools, just pick one.

01:22.318 --> 01:23.518
Yeah, but as soon as I pick one,

01:23.552 --> 01:24.552
Jack's just going to make
plans to follow me there,

01:24.587 --> 01:26.387
like a puppy or something.

01:26.422 --> 01:28.423
Um, you love Jack.

01:28.457 --> 01:31.493
Remember all those months
of crying in the hospital...

01:31.527 --> 01:35.563
Please, just wake up Jack, wake up,

01:35.598 --> 01:37.665
I'll do anything if you'll just wake up.

01:38.612 --> 01:39.612
I never said that.

01:39.647 --> 01:40.780
Yeah, you did. Yeah, you did.

01:40.815 --> 01:42.515
Don't make me feel like a bad person

01:42.550 --> 01:43.683
just because I don't want to be obligated

01:43.717 --> 01:45.318
to some guy right out of high school.

01:45.352 --> 01:46.419
Some guy?

01:46.453 --> 01:48.655
You've known this guy for four years.

01:48.689 --> 01:50.356
Doesn't mean I have to marry him.

01:50.391 --> 01:51.624
Uh, you're wearing an engagement ring.

01:51.659 --> 01:53.693
So what! You're wearing a wedding
ring and you're not even married.

01:53.727 --> 01:55.328
Hey. Calm down.

01:55.362 --> 01:56.696
Oh, come on.

01:56.730 --> 01:58.398
You don't want to get
married any more than we do

01:58.432 --> 02:00.466
and you're wearing an engagement ring too.

02:00.501 --> 02:01.634
I want to get married.

02:01.669 --> 02:04.470
I just don't want to get
married and go to New York.

02:04.505 --> 02:05.605
Well, I do.

02:07.408 --> 02:09.741
I do. I want to get married
and I'm going to get married,

02:09.776 --> 02:12.545
and I am leaving right after
that and going to New York.

02:12.580 --> 02:14.681
- Well, that's not married.
- Yes, it is.

02:14.715 --> 02:16.416
No sex is not married.

02:16.450 --> 02:18.418
Especially when you're
living across the country

02:18.452 --> 02:21.354
from your husband and kid and going
to school with your old boyfriend.

02:21.388 --> 02:22.622
Oh, I'm not even going to see Ben.

02:22.656 --> 02:24.691
Oh, please. Ben is going to see you.

02:24.725 --> 02:26.326
Okay. Well, Ben's feelings for me

02:26.360 --> 02:28.328
have nothing to do with
my feelings for Ricky.

02:28.362 --> 02:32.365
Ben's a good guy. Maybe in the
end, you'll end up with him.

02:32.399 --> 02:34.634
- Why? So you can have Ricky back?
- I'm engaged.

02:34.668 --> 02:37.370
Okay. Well, you're not getting
married so you're not really engaged.

02:37.404 --> 02:38.371
I slept with him.

02:39.773 --> 02:41.608
I slept with Jack because I somehow thought

02:41.642 --> 02:43.476
that would delay our getting married.

02:43.510 --> 02:44.711
How?

02:44.745 --> 02:46.679
I don't know, I just... I figured
that's all he really wants,

02:46.714 --> 02:49.349
so if I give him that then
maybe he'd just lose interest.

02:49.383 --> 02:52.418
Not unless he's really
not having a good time.

02:52.453 --> 02:53.519
Oh, he's having a good time.

02:53.554 --> 02:54.787
Okay, please, you know how I feel

02:54.822 --> 02:57.390
about talking about guys
and how they are in bed.

02:57.424 --> 02:59.392
- I don't want to hear it.
- They talk about us.

02:59.426 --> 03:01.394
Ricky does not talk about me.

03:02.529 --> 03:04.564
Yeah, what happened to him?

03:04.598 --> 03:08.501
He used to be hot, now
he's just so... so blah.

03:09.370 --> 03:10.470
Why do you say that?

03:10.504 --> 03:12.605
Because he used to stand up for himself.

03:12.640 --> 03:16.342
Now he just, you know, rolls over.

03:16.377 --> 03:18.578
He's giving you everything you
want, Amy, and in doing that,

03:18.612 --> 03:20.546
he's kind of lost his edge,

03:20.581 --> 03:22.548
he's not the bad boy anymore,

03:22.583 --> 03:25.752
he's just Old Man Ricky.

03:25.786 --> 03:28.388
Same thing with Jack.

03:28.422 --> 03:29.722
Neither of them have any guts anymore.

03:29.757 --> 03:30.757
Oh, you're so right.

03:30.791 --> 03:33.326
- No she's not.
- Yeah, she is.

03:33.360 --> 03:34.360
I mean when they were the bad boys,

03:34.395 --> 03:36.296
we liked them so much better.

03:36.330 --> 03:38.665
And when I was the good
girl, I liked me better.

03:38.699 --> 03:40.466
This is so screwed up.

03:40.501 --> 03:42.302
I cannot seem to figure
out a way to get out of it.

03:42.336 --> 03:44.337
You just have to tell him that
you don't want to get married.

03:45.439 --> 03:47.373
What? I want to get married.

03:47.408 --> 03:49.475
- No, you don't.
- Neither do you.

04:01.588 --> 04:04.290
- Hey Dad.
- I like that, your calling me "Dad."

04:04.325 --> 04:05.658
Me too.

04:05.693 --> 04:06.626
So I guess you're
confident that all is well.

04:06.660 --> 04:08.361
Yeah.

04:08.395 --> 04:10.563
The three stooges look like
they're cooking up something to me.

04:10.597 --> 04:13.333
Don't worry about it, they
all just like to complain.

04:13.367 --> 04:14.767
Adrian will go to New York with Omar,

04:14.802 --> 04:17.370
Grace is going to go to school
with Jack and she'll marry him

04:17.404 --> 04:19.305
and Amy is going to marry me
and go to school in New York

04:19.339 --> 04:21.406
and we're all going to
live happily ever after.

04:21.442 --> 04:23.476
Yeah, we'll see about that.

04:26.827 --> 04:41.758
- synced and corrected by chamallow -

04:45.666 --> 04:48.534
So, wedding day, do we
have some sort of schedule?

04:49.436 --> 04:50.770
Yes. Yes, yes.

04:50.804 --> 04:54.407
So, Jack's dad said five o'clock,

04:54.441 --> 04:55.575
if that's okay with everyone.

04:55.609 --> 04:58.311
You know what, if everyone
comes over here afterwards,

04:58.345 --> 04:59.345
we'll never get rid of them,

04:59.380 --> 05:02.615
so what I'm thinking is,

05:02.649 --> 05:05.385
why don't we have, like, a cocktail party,

05:05.419 --> 05:07.353
without the cocktails, beforehand,

05:07.388 --> 05:09.322
and then we'll go to the
church, and say our vows

05:09.356 --> 05:10.723
and then we can come home alone, just us.

05:10.758 --> 05:13.559
And we'll let John stay with my
Dad and Kathleen or something.

05:13.594 --> 05:15.428
Whatever you want, Amy.

05:15.462 --> 05:16.662
Well, it should be what you want too.

05:16.697 --> 05:19.332
I just want to be married to you.

05:19.366 --> 05:22.268
I know, and I want to
be married to you, but

05:22.302 --> 05:24.504
I want the day to be for the
two of us, what we both want.

05:24.538 --> 05:26.406
The party beforehand sounds perfect.

05:27.641 --> 05:30.510
I'll get John up and dressed

05:30.544 --> 05:32.345
and I can drop him off, if you want.

05:32.379 --> 05:33.746
I'm working this morning.

05:33.781 --> 05:35.415
Leo's stopping by,

05:35.449 --> 05:37.417
he said he had an offer
that might help us both out,

05:37.451 --> 05:40.520
so I'm hoping that means more hours
for me or a raise or something.

05:40.554 --> 05:41.654
That'd be great,

05:41.688 --> 05:42.755
but he's already helped us out

05:42.790 --> 05:46.325
more than either of our families, so...

05:46.360 --> 05:48.728
I don't know, should we
accept any more help from him?

05:48.762 --> 05:50.763
I don't know what it is
that he's offering yet,

05:50.798 --> 05:52.598
I've been looking for
ways to earn more money

05:52.633 --> 05:53.766
and he's made it pretty clear

05:53.801 --> 05:55.568
that he wants me to stay
with this business, so...

05:55.602 --> 05:57.637
I hope it's more of a
business thing than just help.

05:57.671 --> 05:59.372
And you don't have any classes today?

05:59.406 --> 06:00.473
This afternoon.

06:00.507 --> 06:03.276
Then next week I have finals, then

06:03.310 --> 06:04.644
I'm finished with the
first year of college.

06:06.280 --> 06:07.547
One down and three to go.

06:07.581 --> 06:09.382
The time will go fast, Amy.

06:09.416 --> 06:11.350
We'll be okay with you in I in New York.

06:11.385 --> 06:13.553
It's not going to be easy,
but it's just a few years

06:13.587 --> 06:15.555
and we have the rest of our lives together.

06:17.458 --> 06:18.424
Yeah.

06:23.430 --> 06:24.630
I don't know if you realize but

06:24.665 --> 06:26.365
summer school starts the same day

06:26.400 --> 06:28.301
that band camp started four years ago.

06:35.609 --> 06:36.609
Perfect.

06:42.649 --> 06:44.283
Hey!

06:46.320 --> 06:48.454
Oh. Geez. Sorry.

06:51.692 --> 06:55.428
So when were you going to tell me?

06:55.462 --> 06:58.331
- Tell you what?
- That you broke up with Kathy.

06:58.365 --> 06:59.398
I didn't break up with her,

06:59.433 --> 07:01.400
we're just taking a break.

07:01.435 --> 07:03.569
The difference being?

07:03.604 --> 07:05.571
We're friends and we
don't want to be serious,

07:05.606 --> 07:07.306
so before things get serious,

07:07.341 --> 07:09.308
we're going to take a
break and see other people.

07:09.343 --> 07:13.212
What other people? That girl
you were talking to on the phone

07:13.247 --> 07:14.614
at one o'clock this morning?

07:14.648 --> 07:16.382
Yeah. Her.

07:16.416 --> 07:18.651
- Her name is Layla.
- I don't like her.

07:18.685 --> 07:20.620
Why not?

07:20.654 --> 07:24.290
Because she was on the
phone with you at one o'clock

07:24.324 --> 07:26.292
when you have school today.

07:26.326 --> 07:27.493
She is at your school, right?

07:27.528 --> 07:28.594
Yes.

07:28.629 --> 07:30.396
Are you having sex with her?

07:30.430 --> 07:31.697
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

07:31.732 --> 07:33.432
Are you having sex with her?

07:33.467 --> 07:35.401
I was thinking about it, all right?

07:35.435 --> 07:38.437
I don't know if it is all right.

07:38.439 --> 07:42.441
Are you sure you're ready to
have this kind of relationship?

07:42.476 --> 07:44.577
I've been ready for a while now.

07:44.611 --> 07:47.613
I wasn't asking you if everything
is functioning properly,

07:47.648 --> 07:50.550
I'm asking you if you're ready to be

07:50.584 --> 07:53.386
that intimately involved
with a young woman.

07:53.420 --> 07:54.453
Yes.

07:54.488 --> 07:56.289
Then why not Kathy?

07:56.323 --> 07:58.391
Because she had a baby,

07:58.425 --> 08:02.261
she doesn't want to have sex
in high school, ever again.

08:02.296 --> 08:06.432
So because she doesn't want to have sex,

08:06.466 --> 08:08.301
you don't want to be her boyfriend?

08:08.335 --> 08:11.370
Um, well, it's not just that, it's that

08:11.405 --> 08:14.407
Layla does want to have sex
so I want to be her boyfriend.

08:14.441 --> 08:17.510
You are too young to have sex.

08:17.544 --> 08:21.447
High school is too young to have sex,

08:21.481 --> 08:23.449
but I guess if you're going to have sex,

08:23.483 --> 08:24.483
you're gonna have sex.

08:24.518 --> 08:26.352
- Do you have condoms?
- No.

08:26.386 --> 08:27.620
I'm too embarrassed to buy them,

08:27.654 --> 08:29.188
she said she'd get them.

08:29.223 --> 08:30.523
You're too embarrassed to buy condoms,

08:30.557 --> 08:32.325
but not too embarrassed to have sex

08:32.359 --> 08:34.293
with someone you hardly know.

08:34.328 --> 08:35.595
I think it's easier that way,

08:35.629 --> 08:38.364
to have sex with someone
you don't know that ll.

08:38.398 --> 08:40.566
I mean, if it were Kathy, I'd
be kind of worried about her,

08:40.601 --> 08:46.305
but with Layla, I don't
know, it's almost anonymous.

08:46.340 --> 08:47.373
She says I should try it,

08:47.407 --> 08:48.507
it's not that serious, it's fun.

08:48.542 --> 08:50.276
Unless you get her pregnant,

08:50.310 --> 08:54.480
- or you get an STI or...
- STI?

08:54.514 --> 08:56.582
Sexually transmitted infection?

08:57.584 --> 08:59.418
Oh. Yeah.

09:01.555 --> 09:04.490
But a condom should
take care of that, right?

09:04.524 --> 09:07.493
Well there are things that
can be transmitted orally.

09:07.527 --> 09:10.196
All right, I hope we are near
the end of our discussion.

09:10.230 --> 09:11.464
Embarrassed again?

09:11.498 --> 09:12.531
Just say what you want to say.

09:15.202 --> 09:17.536
Don't have sex.

09:17.571 --> 09:20.473
And if you do have sex, use a condom,

09:20.507 --> 09:22.275
make sure that she's on the pill,

09:22.309 --> 09:24.410
but despite the condoms and pills,

09:24.444 --> 09:28.281
it still isn't safe because
you can get your heart broken.

09:28.315 --> 09:30.349
My heart really has very
little to do with it.

09:31.418 --> 09:33.352
I don't doubt that.

09:33.387 --> 09:37.189
So as long as you're safe,

09:37.224 --> 09:40.493
and as long as you have her
parents' permission, then...

09:40.527 --> 09:43.229
Permission? I'm not going
to ask their permission.

09:43.263 --> 09:44.530
Why would I ask their permission?

09:46.433 --> 09:47.566
All right.

09:51.204 --> 09:56.375
I could call her parents and ask them

09:56.410 --> 09:58.311
if you don't want to ask them.

10:06.245 --> 10:07.845
- Hey.
- Hey!

10:07.879 --> 10:08.879
You got something to eat,

10:08.914 --> 10:09.947
like something I can take with me?

10:09.982 --> 10:11.148
I have to get to school.

10:12.884 --> 10:14.151
Are you and Jack having sex again?

10:16.021 --> 10:17.855
What!

10:17.889 --> 10:19.890
What are you talking about? Why
would you ask me something like that?

10:19.925 --> 10:21.892
Because there seems to be a open,

10:21.927 --> 10:23.861
empty condom wrapper on your skirt.

10:25.998 --> 10:29.267
Ew! How did that get
there? That is so gross!

10:29.301 --> 10:30.968
Where did that come from?

10:31.003 --> 10:33.237
Oh, my God! I must've sat
on an empty condom wrapper!

10:33.272 --> 10:35.006
- Grace.
- That is disgusting.

10:35.040 --> 10:36.274
Do you have any gloves
so I can get rid of it?

10:36.308 --> 10:38.909
It's just a wrapper, and my guess is,

10:38.944 --> 10:41.078
that you were the one
who used the contents.

10:41.113 --> 10:42.113
I did not.

10:45.217 --> 10:47.285
Jack did.

10:47.319 --> 10:49.987
Grace! I thought you decided you were
going to wait until you got married.

10:50.022 --> 10:52.323
Yeah, yeah, I was going to wait

10:52.357 --> 10:54.158
because I thought Jack
would get tired of waiting

10:54.192 --> 10:56.093
and just go marry someone else.

10:56.128 --> 10:58.195
But instead you slept with Jack?

10:58.230 --> 11:00.231
Yeah. I slept with him.

11:00.265 --> 11:02.133
But I take it, you
don't want to marry Jack,

11:02.167 --> 11:03.868
you want him to marry someone else.

11:03.902 --> 11:07.305
I love him. It's just... he's so needy.

11:07.339 --> 11:09.907
And so irritating.

11:09.941 --> 11:10.975
I wish I'd just stayed with Grant.

11:11.009 --> 11:12.109
He's going to Harvard.

11:12.144 --> 11:15.246
- So you slept with Jack?
- I just said I did.

11:15.280 --> 11:17.315
Good morning.

11:17.349 --> 11:19.950
- She's sleeping with Jack.
- Mom!

11:19.985 --> 11:22.887
Well, at least you're using protection.

11:22.921 --> 11:25.323
Would you throw that away, or do
you want to go to school like that?

11:28.160 --> 11:30.161
She doesn't want to marry Jack.

11:30.195 --> 11:32.096
All right then, don't marry Jack.

11:32.130 --> 11:34.198
But she said yes, she's
wearing an engagement ring.

11:34.232 --> 11:35.966
And she's having sex with him.

11:36.001 --> 11:37.234
Doesn't mean she has to marry him

11:37.269 --> 11:39.036
- if she doesn't want to marry him.
- Thank you.

11:39.071 --> 11:41.906
Then she should tell him
instead of trying to...

11:41.940 --> 11:43.207
What are you trying to do, Grace?

11:43.241 --> 11:44.909
I'm trying to slow things down.

11:44.943 --> 11:46.243
I don't want to get
married out of high school,

11:46.278 --> 11:48.079
I don't even want to get
married out of college,

11:48.113 --> 11:50.214
I want to get married when I
always said I wanted to get married,

11:50.248 --> 11:51.916
when I get out of medical school.

11:51.950 --> 11:53.951
Sounds like a plan to me.
All right, I'll be going now.

11:53.985 --> 11:55.086
Wait, George, you're a guy,

11:55.120 --> 11:57.088
tell her that she needs
to tell Jack her plans.

11:57.122 --> 11:58.322
It's not fair to him,

11:58.357 --> 12:00.024
to take the ring, and to have sex

12:00.058 --> 12:01.959
and have no intention of getting married.

12:01.993 --> 12:03.160
That's usually a guy move.

12:03.195 --> 12:04.261
Mom, he's just been through so much,

12:04.296 --> 12:06.997
I can't tell him, I can't.

12:09.868 --> 12:11.168
Maybe you could tell him.

12:11.203 --> 12:13.137
Oh, no. No, I can't tell him.

12:13.171 --> 12:14.238
Sure you could, I mean,

12:14.272 --> 12:16.006
maybe he doesn't even want to get married.

12:16.041 --> 12:17.208
I mean maybe he feels rushed into it too.

12:17.242 --> 12:18.242
And maybe now that we're having sex,

12:18.276 --> 12:19.977
maybe that's enough for him.

12:20.011 --> 12:21.912
And maybe he just wants to have
sex with you the rest of his life.

12:21.947 --> 12:24.148
I don't know. But that's
between you and Jack.

12:24.182 --> 12:26.117
But you're so funny, and
you're so good with people,

12:26.151 --> 12:28.119
and can't you just help me
out, please, I'm begging you.

12:28.153 --> 12:29.954
Grace, really, the most I can do is

12:29.988 --> 12:31.222
offer to give the two of you a free dinner,

12:31.256 --> 12:32.890
I can't get in the middle of this.

12:32.924 --> 12:34.191
No, please, stepfather George,

12:34.226 --> 12:36.827
- please get in the middle of this.
- I can't.

12:36.862 --> 12:38.129
Grace, you're an adult now,

12:38.163 --> 12:39.864
you need to tell your fiance

12:39.898 --> 12:41.866
that you don't want to
get married right now.

12:41.900 --> 12:43.234
And if you've told other
people how you feel,

12:43.268 --> 12:46.837
then you need to tell Jack before
one of those people tells him.

12:46.872 --> 12:48.205
At least you can have
that much respect for him.

12:49.040 --> 12:50.975
All right.

12:51.009 --> 12:52.877
Thanks a lot for your help.

13:01.253 --> 13:04.021
She called me "stepfather."
I think we're making progress.

13:09.227 --> 13:12.863
- Hey Jack, did you just get home?
- Yeah.

13:12.898 --> 13:14.131
How are things going with Grace?

13:14.166 --> 13:15.866
Uh, better than expected.

13:15.901 --> 13:17.201
Okay.

13:17.235 --> 13:19.203
All right, just got to pick up some books,

13:19.237 --> 13:22.106
I'm finishing up some classes in the next
couple of weeks so I can cash these in.

13:22.140 --> 13:23.841
When you say "better than expected,"

13:23.875 --> 13:25.009
what did you mean by that?

13:25.043 --> 13:26.977
It means I love her more than ever, Dad.

13:27.012 --> 13:28.846
I see.

13:28.880 --> 13:32.983
It's just, I somehow got the impression
that it meant you and Grace are

13:33.018 --> 13:34.151
- involved physically.
- That too.

13:35.187 --> 13:37.121
Is that how this engagement came about?

13:37.155 --> 13:38.989
You agreed to marry Grace if she would...

13:39.024 --> 13:42.159
No, no. That was her
idea, completely her idea.

13:42.194 --> 13:43.961
Was it a good idea?

13:43.995 --> 13:46.163
I'm all healed. I don't think
I'm going to hurt anything.

13:46.198 --> 13:47.965
Your mother thinks that...

13:47.999 --> 13:50.167
maybe you jumped into
this a little too quickly.

13:50.202 --> 13:52.203
Maybe you should have taken
a little more time to recover

13:52.237 --> 13:55.272
before you made any big
decisions like getting married.

13:55.307 --> 13:57.942
Not that we don't love
Grace, we love Grace.

13:57.976 --> 13:59.276
I don't think Mom loves Grace.

13:59.311 --> 14:00.344
No, she loves her.

14:00.378 --> 14:02.913
She always thought Madison
would be a better choice.

14:02.948 --> 14:04.215
Well, there are lots and
lots of choices out there

14:04.249 --> 14:05.249
that you haven't even met.

14:05.283 --> 14:07.017
I don't want to meet anyone,

14:07.052 --> 14:09.153
I'm not interested in meeting anyone.

14:09.187 --> 14:12.223
I want Grace and I've got Grace.

14:12.257 --> 14:13.924
I gotta go, Dad, I've got class.

14:13.959 --> 14:14.925
Okay.

14:18.029 --> 14:19.196
Why are you saying all this now?

14:20.932 --> 14:23.033
No reason.

14:23.068 --> 14:26.036
It's just that your mother
wanted me to talk to you about

14:26.071 --> 14:28.038
your sudden decision to get married.

14:28.073 --> 14:30.207
Although I don't think it was so sudden,

14:30.242 --> 14:31.275
she just got the impression

14:31.309 --> 14:34.278
that you and Grace had
become close again and

14:34.312 --> 14:37.882
she wanted you to know,
we both wanted you to know,

14:37.916 --> 14:40.017
that if you had rushed into anything,

14:40.051 --> 14:42.052
that you could always change your mind.

14:42.087 --> 14:44.922
Dad, after all Grace did
for me when I was recovering,

14:44.956 --> 14:48.058
how could you and Mom even think that
there would be someone else for me?

14:48.093 --> 14:50.160
She's the one, Dad. Grace is it.

14:50.195 --> 14:51.929
And I can't wait to be married to her,

14:51.963 --> 14:55.032
whether it's next week,
next month or next year.

14:55.066 --> 14:57.067
I'm going to be with
Grace the rest of my life.

14:57.102 --> 14:58.302
Okay.

14:58.336 --> 15:00.271
Just so you're sure
about what you're doing.

15:00.305 --> 15:01.972
Hey, maybe it's your mom and me

15:02.007 --> 15:03.908
who are having second thoughts.

15:03.942 --> 15:06.010
You seem 100% certain
you're doing the right thing.

15:06.044 --> 15:08.078
- I am. Bye, Dad.
- See you.

15:14.886 --> 15:16.320
You're right, they're sleeping together.

15:16.354 --> 15:20.090
Told you, I could tell from
the look on his face he's happy,

15:20.125 --> 15:22.059
and not in a way I like him to be happy.

15:22.093 --> 15:23.861
Still, we should just let him be happy.

15:23.895 --> 15:26.997
No! His happiness is based on a lie.

15:27.032 --> 15:28.899
He thinks she loves him.

15:28.934 --> 15:29.967
She was going to break up with him!

15:30.001 --> 15:31.302
She doesn't love him, not at all.

15:31.336 --> 15:34.171
She accepted his proposal, they're engaged!

15:34.205 --> 15:36.307
They're all hot for each other.

15:36.341 --> 15:38.275
What makes you think she doesn't love him?

15:38.310 --> 15:41.178
Because I don't love her!

15:41.212 --> 15:43.113
I just didn't want her to
break things off with him,

15:43.148 --> 15:44.915
I didn't want her to marry him.

15:45.951 --> 15:46.984
I like Madison!

15:47.018 --> 15:48.185
It's not up to us, dear.

15:48.219 --> 15:49.320
Jack loves who he loves.

15:49.354 --> 15:51.188
I'm not so sure.

15:51.222 --> 15:53.223
Hey, do me a favor, drop it.

15:58.906 --> 16:02.776
I'm leaving. All right?

16:03.878 --> 16:05.712
I'll see you when you get back!

16:05.746 --> 16:09.549
Adrian, do you have a minute before you go?

16:10.685 --> 16:11.885
I need to talk to you.

16:13.654 --> 16:15.989
Uh, yeah. I have a minute.

16:16.023 --> 16:17.957
But what do you want to talk to me about

16:17.992 --> 16:19.993
that you couldn't have
talked to me about last night?

16:20.027 --> 16:22.529
Last night, we weren't
doing too much talking.

16:23.698 --> 16:25.699
I know. It was nice.

16:29.537 --> 16:30.503
What's wrong?

16:30.938 --> 16:32.505
Why don't we sit down?

16:32.540 --> 16:33.907
Because I don't want to sit down.

16:33.941 --> 16:36.543
If I sit down, I might hear
something I don't want to hear.

16:37.912 --> 16:39.946
Are you cheating on me or something?

16:39.980 --> 16:42.549
No. I'm not cheating on you.

16:42.583 --> 16:45.618
And I would never cheat on you. But...

16:45.653 --> 16:48.722
I've been thinking about
us and about New York

16:48.756 --> 16:51.758
and about everything and...

16:53.561 --> 16:55.829
there's just no easy
way to say this Adrian.

16:56.964 --> 16:58.698
I'm not sure that I want to be in New York

16:58.733 --> 17:00.500
and have my fiancée living here.

17:01.736 --> 17:03.503
Oh.

17:03.537 --> 17:08.641
So you're not going to New York?

17:08.675 --> 17:09.943
Because you should go to New York.

17:09.977 --> 17:11.711
You have to go to New York.

17:11.746 --> 17:13.512
This is one of those
opportunities of a lifetime.

17:13.547 --> 17:17.717
I know. And I have to
go, I want to go. But...

17:20.688 --> 17:22.655
I don't think I want to be engaged.

17:24.724 --> 17:26.626
I want the ring back,

17:26.660 --> 17:28.895
and if it works out so
that you love me so much

17:28.929 --> 17:29.963
that you want to be with me

17:29.997 --> 17:31.564
more than you want to live here by yourself

17:31.599 --> 17:33.733
and go to school, then

17:33.768 --> 17:34.968
we'll get married and live in New York.

17:37.738 --> 17:38.905
What?

17:38.939 --> 17:41.641
I don't want to be engaged
and living in New York alone.

17:41.675 --> 17:45.578
- I don't want that.
- But that's how it is.

17:45.613 --> 17:49.682
You are engaged and you'll
be living in New York.

17:49.717 --> 17:53.887
Adrian, I love you, I really do.

17:53.921 --> 17:55.955
Let's just agree to go our
separate ways this summer

17:55.990 --> 17:57.857
and see how that feels.

17:57.892 --> 17:59.759
You know, why don't we just go ahead

17:59.794 --> 18:03.863
and do what we said we'd do this
summer and see how that feels, okay?

18:03.898 --> 18:07.634
I'll go to school here and you'll
fly back and forth from New York

18:07.668 --> 18:09.569
and sometimes I'll go there with you.

18:09.603 --> 18:10.904
What's wrong with that plan?

18:10.938 --> 18:12.572
It's not what I want.

18:12.606 --> 18:16.576
Yeah, well... it's what I want.

18:16.610 --> 18:18.611
It is! It's what I want!

18:18.646 --> 18:19.913
I don't think it's really what you want,

18:19.947 --> 18:22.515
you've got one foot in the
relationship and one foot out,

18:22.550 --> 18:25.485
which leaves you in total conflict, so

18:26.821 --> 18:29.689
I'm going to ask you for the ring back

18:29.723 --> 18:30.857
and we can stay in touch with each other

18:30.891 --> 18:32.659
or we can take a break for a few months

18:32.693 --> 18:34.828
and see how we feel at
the end of the summer.

18:36.597 --> 18:38.832
It belongs to my family.

18:38.866 --> 18:40.600
If I had bought it for you brand new,

18:40.634 --> 18:43.770
I'd just give it to you, but

18:43.804 --> 18:46.873
- I want it back.
- Why didn't you tell me this last night?

18:48.709 --> 18:51.845
You had sex with me knowing you
were going to break up with me.

18:51.879 --> 18:53.513
You've been having sex with me

18:53.547 --> 18:54.948
when you don't want to marry
me. What's the difference?

18:54.982 --> 18:56.916
There's a big difference!

18:58.886 --> 19:02.589
Okay, there's a big difference.

19:02.623 --> 19:04.657
I wasn't sure I could do this,

19:04.692 --> 19:06.793
but I woke up this morning

19:06.827 --> 19:08.628
and felt I wanted to do this,

19:09.530 --> 19:10.830
so I'm doing this.

19:19.507 --> 19:20.840
I'm sorry, Adrian,

19:20.875 --> 19:22.709
but I'm just not feeling it.

19:22.743 --> 19:24.677
I'm not feeling that you love
me and want to be with me,

19:24.712 --> 19:26.479
and I deserve better than that.

19:26.514 --> 19:28.515
And you deserve better than
to be obligated to a man

19:28.549 --> 19:29.883
that you don't really love.

19:46.634 --> 19:47.834
Wait, wait...

19:50.905 --> 19:52.739
what are you doing, Adrian?

19:52.773 --> 19:55.842
You trying to use sex to
get something you don't want?

19:55.876 --> 19:57.577
I don't know.

19:57.611 --> 19:58.711
I have to go.

19:58.746 --> 20:00.780
I have to get to the airport,

20:00.814 --> 20:02.949
and you have to get to class.

20:11.659 --> 20:12.792
Bye, Adrian.

20:29.743 --> 20:30.810
Hi, Ricky.

20:32.680 --> 20:33.746
Hi.

20:36.717 --> 20:37.884
Hi.

20:37.918 --> 20:39.586
Hi.

20:39.620 --> 20:41.788
So, you're back.

20:41.822 --> 20:46.526
I am. I didn't want to just
run into you at the bookstore,

20:46.560 --> 20:49.762
after that stupid letter I sent you.

20:49.797 --> 20:51.931
I can't believe I did
that. How embarrassing.

20:51.966 --> 20:53.600
Proclaiming my love to you in a note

20:53.634 --> 20:55.735
like some middle school girl.

20:55.769 --> 20:59.806
Oh my God, I can't believe
I told you all that stuff.

20:59.840 --> 21:03.610
Okay. Well, did you mean what you said?

21:03.644 --> 21:05.612
Yeah, I did,

21:05.646 --> 21:08.681
but it was stupid, it
was a stupid thing to do.

21:08.716 --> 21:12.619
You didn't need to know how I felt and...

21:15.556 --> 21:17.690
I heard that you and
Amy are getting married

21:17.725 --> 21:19.459
the day after she graduates.

21:20.728 --> 21:23.630
Congratulations. And, um,

21:23.664 --> 21:26.799
- I'll see you at school, I guess.
- Okay. Thanks.

21:26.834 --> 21:29.636
And, uh, that's Leo
Boykewich so, I have to go.

21:29.670 --> 21:30.903
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

21:30.938 --> 21:33.873
This is Clementine. Clementine,
this is Leo Boykewich.

21:33.907 --> 21:36.843
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

21:36.877 --> 21:39.479
Well, I got to go, and, um...

21:40.481 --> 21:41.514
Bye, Ricky.

21:41.548 --> 21:42.882
- See you at school.
- Yeah.

21:50.791 --> 21:53.559
So that was Clementine.

21:53.594 --> 21:55.495
Yeah. She took the semester off

21:55.529 --> 21:56.629
and she just got back into town.

21:56.664 --> 21:57.930
She just stopped in to say hello.

21:57.965 --> 21:59.599
You don't have to explain anything to me.

21:59.633 --> 22:02.568
I didn't know she was coming,
it was a complete surprise.

22:02.603 --> 22:04.704
- Whatever.
- She heard Amy and I are getting married,

22:04.738 --> 22:06.606
she just wanted to say congratulations

22:06.640 --> 22:08.541
and all that. She's an old friend.

22:08.575 --> 22:10.677
If you keep talking about her, I'm going
to think you have some interest in her

22:10.711 --> 22:12.745
other than friendship.

22:12.780 --> 22:14.514
I want to talk to you about something

22:14.548 --> 22:16.649
before I talk to Ben and Amy about it.

22:16.684 --> 22:19.519
I have a place for them to live.

22:19.553 --> 22:21.487
Them? The two of them?

22:21.522 --> 22:24.457
I own property around the
butcher shop in New York,

22:24.491 --> 22:26.559
I paid a family member to
renovate the building for me

22:26.593 --> 22:28.428
and I let him live in it

22:28.462 --> 22:30.496
while he was doing the construction.

22:30.531 --> 22:35.435
Well, the construction took about three
years longer than it was supposed to take,

22:35.469 --> 22:38.404
but now I've got myself a three
family building in Hell's Kitchen,

22:38.439 --> 22:41.574
which isn't too far away from where
Ben and Amy are going to school.

22:41.608 --> 22:44.544
I thought I'd offer her
the basement apartment

22:44.578 --> 22:47.580
and Ben the top floor
apartment for four years.

22:47.614 --> 22:50.817
They've got four years to live
there and graduate from school.

22:50.851 --> 22:54.454
I figure if the two of them
are going to get together,

22:54.488 --> 22:55.521
they're going to get together

22:55.556 --> 22:57.690
whether they're a floor
apart or miles apart.

22:57.725 --> 23:00.460
Do you mind if I ask you
why you'd do this for Amy?

23:00.494 --> 23:03.730
It's near the butcher shop, and the
apartment is bigger than this one.

23:03.764 --> 23:06.566
And if you want to move to New York,

23:06.600 --> 23:08.668
there's room for you and John,

23:08.702 --> 23:11.704
and all three of you can live
there together comfortably,

23:11.739 --> 23:14.607
and you can still work
at Boykewich Butchers.

23:14.641 --> 23:17.477
I don't want to lose you from the
company, I've told you that before.

23:17.511 --> 23:19.746
But, what if I don't want to go to New York

23:19.780 --> 23:22.815
and work at the butcher shop,
what if I want to stay here?

23:22.850 --> 23:24.817
What I want is to get married

23:24.852 --> 23:26.519
and have Amy go to school in New York

23:26.553 --> 23:28.454
and have her come back here.

23:28.489 --> 23:29.689
Then Amy can have a safe
place to live in New York,

23:29.723 --> 23:31.591
and she'll be right under Uncle Eddie

23:31.625 --> 23:32.825
and he could keep an eye on her.

23:32.860 --> 23:34.861
And Ben.

23:34.895 --> 23:37.730
All I do is provide opportunity.

23:37.765 --> 23:40.733
What people do with that
opportunity is totally up to them.

23:40.768 --> 23:43.770
Thanks Leo. If that's what Amy wants to do,

23:43.804 --> 23:45.805
then that's a very generous offer.

23:50.930 --> 23:51.963
I don't know what I'm doing.

23:51.998 --> 23:53.064
You have to go to college.

23:53.099 --> 23:55.100
No, I don't. College isn't for everyone.

23:55.134 --> 23:57.769
It's for you! You want
to go, you know you do.

23:57.803 --> 23:59.804
Yeah, but if Henry wants
to go to the Philippines

23:59.839 --> 24:01.139
and work in a hotel for a year,

24:01.173 --> 24:04.776
then good for you, Henry,
that's life experience. Booyah!

24:04.810 --> 24:06.244
Yeah. Booyah!

24:06.279 --> 24:08.013
And it's money.

24:08.047 --> 24:09.814
And then after a year, if
I want to go to college,

24:09.849 --> 24:11.216
I'll have the money to go to college.

24:11.250 --> 24:13.051
If you don't go next year, you won't go.

24:13.085 --> 24:15.053
What are you getting so upset about?

24:15.087 --> 24:16.988
It's not like you and I were
going off to college together.

24:17.023 --> 24:18.990
We could have, you didn't even apply.

24:19.025 --> 24:20.959
I applied to some colleges,

24:20.993 --> 24:22.961
just not to the colleges you're going to.

24:22.995 --> 24:26.197
Right. I did not apply to the
University of the Philippine Partiers.

24:29.268 --> 24:31.836
I think Alice is still in love with you.

24:31.871 --> 24:33.071
No kidding.

24:33.105 --> 24:35.106
She's trying to get me to
sleep with her one last time.

24:35.141 --> 24:37.175
Are you going to do that?

24:37.209 --> 24:38.977
- No.
- Why not?

24:39.011 --> 24:41.079
Because I'm going to go
have fun in the Philippines

24:41.113 --> 24:44.115
and I don't want to feel guilty
about it or be thinking about Alice.

24:44.150 --> 24:48.086
I'm going to enjoy this next year
and I'm going to make a lot of money.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.021
How many pesos equal a dollar?

24:50.056 --> 24:53.058
Huh? The currency is pesos there, right?

24:53.092 --> 24:56.094
Henry, we've been friends since
the third grade. You're lying.

24:56.128 --> 24:58.997
You're not going to the Philippines
to work at a hotel, what are you up to?

25:01.200 --> 25:02.801
I'm not telling you.

25:07.006 --> 25:10.742
So did you figure out the
housing situation in New York?

25:10.776 --> 25:12.777
I'll tell you what I figured out.

25:12.812 --> 25:16.181
I figured out that Ricky loves me and
he's going to do everything possible

25:16.215 --> 25:18.183
to give me everything that I want.

25:18.217 --> 25:20.852
But you, you're not like that.

25:20.886 --> 25:24.723
Which means, I could never be in love
with you and I would never marry you,

25:24.757 --> 25:26.791
even if there was no Ricky.

25:26.826 --> 25:29.994
So Ben, don't waste your time
going to Hudson University.

25:30.029 --> 25:33.765
Go somewhere else. Because
this is never going to happen.

25:33.799 --> 25:36.768
And I want my husband to be
comfortable with my living in New York

25:36.802 --> 25:37.869
while I'm away from him.

25:37.903 --> 25:39.704
He's not your husband yet.

25:39.739 --> 25:42.006
And, you know, I don't think you
should get everything you want.

25:42.041 --> 25:44.843
I mean, after all, you always
wanted Ricky and then you got him,

25:44.877 --> 25:47.112
and I suspect you don't want him.

25:47.146 --> 25:48.947
And that's why I'm going to New York.

25:48.981 --> 25:50.882
But you don't have to say anything.

25:50.916 --> 25:53.718
How you really feel about getting
married can be our little secret.

25:57.790 --> 25:59.023
Hi, Sis.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.892
Oh, yeah, I keep forgetting.

26:00.926 --> 26:01.960
How's Ben?

26:01.994 --> 26:03.094
He's so annoying.

26:03.129 --> 26:04.829
He just said I'm only going to New York

26:04.864 --> 26:06.698
because I don't really
want to be married to Ricky.

26:06.732 --> 26:08.967
- He knows?
- No, he doesn't know anything.

26:09.001 --> 26:11.803
And I was just venting when I
was talking to you and Adrian.

26:11.837 --> 26:14.739
I'm going to marry Ricky,
I want to marry Ricky.

26:16.742 --> 26:18.176
I can't walk away from
a wedding a second time.

26:25.151 --> 26:28.820
Hey, Ethan, you left your
phone charger at my house.

26:28.854 --> 26:30.789
- Here.
- That's not mine.

26:30.823 --> 26:34.826
Oh, well, I thought it was, it's not
mine, it's not my Grandmother's...

26:34.860 --> 26:36.861
- Maybe it's Brian's.
- No. It's not.

26:36.896 --> 26:38.730
Are you sure that's even
it's a phone charger?

26:38.764 --> 26:41.032
Oh no,  maybe it's not. Maybe it's, like,

26:42.168 --> 26:44.836
for a tablet or something, sorry.

26:44.870 --> 26:45.837
That's okay.

26:47.973 --> 26:51.009
Okay, well, it was nice seeing you.

26:51.043 --> 26:53.044
Yeah, nice seeing you.

26:55.848 --> 26:58.082
So... how was it?

26:58.117 --> 26:59.784
How was what?

26:59.819 --> 27:00.952
Sex.

27:00.986 --> 27:03.121
Oh, we haven't done anything yet.

27:03.923 --> 27:05.924
Oh, well,

27:05.958 --> 27:09.828
if you do and it doesn't turn
out so well, then call me.

27:09.862 --> 27:12.831
I would call you if I don't
like having sex with Layla?

27:12.865 --> 27:16.134
You can. I mean, I don't think
you really care about her,

27:16.168 --> 27:19.904
and meaningless sex is meaningless, so...

27:21.907 --> 27:24.108
you're a really
thoughtful, intelligent guy,

27:24.143 --> 27:25.777
so you probably won't like it,

27:25.811 --> 27:28.112
and even if you do, you'll get bored.

27:28.147 --> 27:31.015
So, yeah, call me.

27:31.050 --> 27:33.651
I completely understand
that you just want to try it.

27:33.686 --> 27:34.953
So try it.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.822
And then we can go back to
being boyfriend and girlfriend?

27:37.857 --> 27:39.858
After I've had sex with another girl?

27:39.892 --> 27:44.729
No, no, no, no. We can be
friends, we can always be friends.

27:45.731 --> 27:46.998
I have a boyfriend.

27:54.773 --> 27:58.943
You know, it doesn't really serve you
to talk about another girl that way.

27:58.978 --> 28:01.746
Kathy's really nice. And
she's been through a hard time.

28:01.780 --> 28:04.716
By her own choosing, she
didn't have to get pregnant.

28:04.750 --> 28:06.084
And hey, who says that's the only guy

28:06.118 --> 28:07.819
she had sex with,

28:07.853 --> 28:09.988
maybe she put the baby up for
adoption because she didn't know

28:10.022 --> 28:11.723
who the father is.

28:11.757 --> 28:14.025
Wow. That's a really rotten thing to say.

28:14.059 --> 28:15.827
I heard it from her two best friends.

28:15.861 --> 28:17.128
And you're telling me because...

28:17.162 --> 28:19.764
Because you practically called me a slut.

28:19.798 --> 28:21.733
And if there's a slut here, she's the slut.

28:21.767 --> 28:23.868
I didn't call you anything,

28:23.959 --> 28:27.094
I was just trying to tell you
that Kathy really likes Ethan,

28:27.128 --> 28:28.896
and he really liked her

28:28.930 --> 28:30.864
until you came along, so if
you don't really care about him,

28:30.899 --> 28:34.001
then don't break them up.

28:34.035 --> 28:35.970
They're broken up, all right?

28:52.988 --> 28:56.824
I can't believe Henry screwed
up our senior year, which I guess

28:56.858 --> 28:59.760
isn't as bad as him screwing up his life.

28:59.794 --> 29:03.063
Because his life and my life
should have been our lives.

29:03.098 --> 29:06.767
We should be together, forever and always.

29:06.801 --> 29:10.804
He was the first guy I slept with
and the only guy I want to sleep with.

29:10.839 --> 29:13.941
I don't want anyone else. Ever.

29:13.975 --> 29:17.945
Alice, sometimes you just have to let go.

29:17.979 --> 29:20.848
What! You're going to give me
a lecture on letting go? You!

29:20.882 --> 29:23.751
You, who are about to follow
a woman who doesn't love you

29:23.785 --> 29:27.054
all the way across the country to New
York when she's about to get married?

29:27.088 --> 29:30.991
Well, sure, it sounds crazy
when you put it like that. But...

29:31.026 --> 29:34.995
She's not about to get married,
I'm sure she isn't. I know her.

29:35.030 --> 29:40.134
And I've waited four years to
get her, and I'm going to get her.

29:40.168 --> 29:43.070
Stop it! Just stop it!

29:43.104 --> 29:47.875
No, I'm going to finish it. And
you know why? Because she loves me.

29:47.909 --> 29:51.011
I know she loves me. That's
why she hasn't married Ricky.

29:51.046 --> 29:53.814
They could go get
married any time, any day,

29:53.848 --> 29:56.717
but they haven't and it's because
she's not in love with him,

29:56.751 --> 29:59.086
and it's not because she wants
to be independent, it's because...

30:00.855 --> 30:03.190
She still holds out hope too that someday,

30:03.224 --> 30:05.125
she and I can find our
way back to each other.

30:06.127 --> 30:07.895
Ben, you need help.

30:07.929 --> 30:08.896
No, I don't.

30:09.931 --> 30:11.865
I know this, Alice.

30:13.768 --> 30:14.868
I know it for a fact.

30:16.071 --> 30:17.838
You didn't.

30:17.872 --> 30:21.742
I did.  I hacked her
computer. She has an E-diary.

30:21.776 --> 30:23.043
I've been dying to tell someone.

30:38.933 --> 30:40.768
Hey, Adrian.

30:43.872 --> 30:44.972
You look like hell.

30:45.006 --> 30:46.573
I feel like hell.

30:46.608 --> 30:47.708
Did something happen?

30:47.742 --> 30:50.577
Yeah. Yeah. Something happened.

30:50.612 --> 30:53.680
Did somebody hurt you? Because if someone
hurt you, I'll get the campus police.

30:53.715 --> 30:54.748
Or...

30:54.783 --> 30:55.916
something.

30:55.950 --> 30:58.986
- I'm just getting better or...
- No one hurt me.

30:59.020 --> 31:00.721
Okay?

31:00.755 --> 31:02.856
No one hurts me. Ever.

31:03.858 --> 31:05.626
Unfortunately, uh,

31:07.028 --> 31:08.662
I had to hurt someone.

31:11.966 --> 31:13.934
I had to break things off with Omar.

31:13.968 --> 31:15.035
Oh.

31:15.069 --> 31:16.570
I'm serious.

31:16.604 --> 31:17.671
It's over.

31:17.705 --> 31:18.772
All right.

31:21.810 --> 31:22.776
I gave him the ring back.

31:24.712 --> 31:26.814
- What happened?
- I just had to be honest.

31:28.650 --> 31:30.050
'Cause that's who I am.

31:31.786 --> 31:33.620
I'm an honest person.

31:33.655 --> 31:37.991
And an honest person doesn't get married

31:38.026 --> 31:40.828
when they know it isn't right.

31:40.862 --> 31:46.633
Omar has this wonderful
job opportunity in New York,

31:46.668 --> 31:49.770
and he begged me to go to New York but

31:50.839 --> 31:52.739
I love this school.

31:52.774 --> 31:55.008
I want to finish school
before I get married.

31:55.043 --> 31:58.011
I want to start a career
before I get married.

32:00.048 --> 32:02.916
I can't go to New York.

32:02.951 --> 32:06.720
I don't want to go to New
York. I have to finish school.

32:06.754 --> 32:08.755
Why can't you do that in New York?

32:08.790 --> 32:10.824
They've got, like,
bunches of schools there.

32:10.859 --> 32:12.860
You know it's a myth that long distance

32:12.894 --> 32:16.029
relationships don't work. That was
before computers and cell phones and...

32:16.064 --> 32:18.031
- You can make it work.
- Look guys,

32:18.066 --> 32:20.868
I don't want you to be
surprised, like Omar.

32:20.902 --> 32:25.973
I mean, we had a perfectly
nice night last night and, uh...

32:27.709 --> 32:28.675
then,

32:30.678 --> 32:32.679
I knew when I got up
this morning, I just...

32:34.849 --> 32:35.816
I had to do it.

32:37.585 --> 32:38.952
I had to break up with him.

32:41.923 --> 32:44.725
And Grace and Amy are
going to break up with you.

32:44.759 --> 32:47.728
We're friends, right? I mean, more than

32:47.762 --> 32:52.799
Grace and Amy and I are friends.
We're friends. We slept together.

32:55.003 --> 32:56.703
Jack, Grace is just having

32:56.738 --> 32:59.006
sex with you, hoping
that will buy her time.

33:00.642 --> 33:01.842
Enough time to break up with you.

33:02.911 --> 33:04.611
She doesn't want to get married.

33:04.646 --> 33:06.013
She doesn't want you
following her to school either.

33:07.782 --> 33:11.752
She wants to go off to college by herself.

33:13.821 --> 33:15.889
She doesn't even want to
think about getting married

33:15.924 --> 33:17.791
until she graduates from medical school.

33:20.061 --> 33:25.599
She sees herself marrying a
really smart doctor or something.

33:26.968 --> 33:29.803
- She doesn't picture herself married to an athlete.
- Adrian!

33:29.837 --> 33:30.871
That's enough.

33:30.905 --> 33:31.972
It's true.

33:33.608 --> 33:35.609
Just like Amy doesn't want to marry you.

33:35.643 --> 33:36.777
She loves you.

33:36.811 --> 33:37.844
She just doesn't want to marry you.

33:40.615 --> 33:42.950
You...

33:42.984 --> 33:45.752
you're just John's father.

33:45.787 --> 33:46.853
That's all.

33:46.888 --> 33:48.822
She needs you to take care of John

33:48.856 --> 33:50.590
so she can have the life that
she's always wanted to have.

33:53.027 --> 33:58.732
I'm... I'm not... I'm not trying
to be mean here, they told me this.

33:58.766 --> 34:00.567
And eventually they're
going to tell you this.

34:01.636 --> 34:03.103
Or they're not.

34:03.137 --> 34:07.541
Which would be even worse, because
you two would be married to them and

34:07.575 --> 34:08.742
they don't want to be married to you.

34:10.645 --> 34:11.610
They just don't want to tell you that.

34:13.047 --> 34:14.915
And now they don't have to.

34:23.690 --> 34:25.559
He broke up with you, didn't he?

34:27.728 --> 34:28.962
What?

34:28.996 --> 34:32.899
Adrian, I've known you for years,

34:32.934 --> 34:35.902
and if you're miserable, you want
everyone else in the world to be miserable

34:35.937 --> 34:38.905
and you don't care how you
achieve that, just as long

34:38.940 --> 34:42.576
as other people don't have the
love that you've always wanted.

34:42.610 --> 34:45.645
So, as your friend,

34:45.679 --> 34:48.614
let me tell you, this was a
really despicable thing to do,

34:48.649 --> 34:51.618
to say these things to Jack and
me, whether or not they're true.

34:51.652 --> 34:53.987
'Cause sometimes people say things
to other people that they don't mean.

34:54.022 --> 34:58.658
Sometimes people just need to say terrible
things out loud, they need to vent.

34:58.693 --> 35:00.961
But the safe place to
do that is in therapy.

35:02.030 --> 35:03.930
So why don't

35:03.965 --> 35:07.601
you go get some help and stop
hurting people around you.

35:07.635 --> 35:10.003
And then, maybe someone can love you.

35:18.946 --> 35:20.714
Sorry.

35:20.748 --> 35:21.882
Hi. Again.

35:24.585 --> 35:26.853
Look Clementine, about that letter...

35:26.888 --> 35:29.790
Oh, please, we don't have to
talk about that again, do we?

35:29.824 --> 35:32.626
I don't want to embarrass you,
especially after you were so willing

35:32.660 --> 35:34.928
to be vulnerable, but...

35:34.962 --> 35:37.631
it's never gonna happen between us.

35:37.665 --> 35:40.634
Even if things don't work out
with Amy, even if she breaks

35:40.668 --> 35:45.539
up with me and we don't get married,
it's never going to happen between us.

35:47.008 --> 35:49.609
I have a lot of fond memories of you too,

35:50.845 --> 35:52.813
but if Amy Juergens doesn't marry me,

35:52.847 --> 35:54.848
it's going to take me a
lifetime to get over it.

35:54.882 --> 35:57.851
And I'll be satisfied just
being the best dad I can be.

35:57.885 --> 36:00.554
So, friends?

36:00.922 --> 36:01.888
Yeah.

36:12.633 --> 36:13.667
So...

36:14.702 --> 36:15.735
you're back.

36:15.770 --> 36:17.938
Yeah, I'm back.

36:19.707 --> 36:21.908
Don't believe what he just said.

36:21.943 --> 36:25.745
If Amy Juergens doesn't marry him...
if she doesn't marry him before she goes

36:25.780 --> 36:29.783
off to New York, he'll come
running to you, believe me.

36:42.812 --> 36:43.879
George?

36:52.922 --> 36:53.955
I thought I saw you.

36:53.990 --> 36:55.857
Oh, I thought I heard something.

36:55.892 --> 36:57.826
Like your name?

36:57.860 --> 37:00.195
Oh, I dropped something, I
was down on the floor, I, uh,

37:00.229 --> 37:02.063
I think Grace was looking for you.

37:02.098 --> 37:03.932
She thought you were
coming over for dinner.

37:03.966 --> 37:07.068
Yeah, I kind of got hung up
at school. Talking to Adrian.

37:07.103 --> 37:09.070
Oh?

37:09.105 --> 37:13.875
Nothing like that. She, uh, she told me
something I'm having a little trouble with.

37:13.910 --> 37:15.043
You know if you have
a problem with someone,

37:15.077 --> 37:16.177
you should speak directly
with that someone,

37:16.212 --> 37:18.013
not with someone else.

37:18.047 --> 37:21.149
Adrian said that Grace doesn't love
me, she doesn't want to marry me

37:21.183 --> 37:23.151
and she wants to go off
to school by herself.

37:23.185 --> 37:25.053
Really?

37:25.087 --> 37:27.822
Yeah, which I find hard to believe
since we're sleeping together again.

37:27.857 --> 37:29.324
Should I know that?

37:29.358 --> 37:31.259
She's my stepdaughter, you know, which
is pretty much just like my daughter.

37:31.294 --> 37:35.196
Come on man, I need some advice
here and I can't talk to my mom

37:35.231 --> 37:36.998
and dad because I don't
think they like Grace.

37:37.033 --> 37:38.133
- Why not?
- I don't think they've

37:38.167 --> 37:40.001
ever thought that she
cares that much about me.

37:40.036 --> 37:41.136
- No?
- No.

37:41.170 --> 37:43.838
Well, maybe she does, maybe she doesn't.

37:43.873 --> 37:45.173
Maybe some days she does
and some days she doesn't.

37:45.207 --> 37:47.809
Women. They're moody. They're
one mood after another.

37:47.843 --> 37:49.911
Do you think she doesn't love me?

37:49.946 --> 37:54.182
I think she loves you, Jack. I just don't
know she's ready to get married right now.

37:54.216 --> 37:56.184
But I don't know. I don't know anything.

37:56.218 --> 37:57.953
Maybe she doesn't even know. I mean,

37:57.987 --> 37:59.187
the end of high school
is a very stressful time.

37:59.221 --> 38:01.222
You're facing the unknown or something.

38:01.257 --> 38:03.892
All right, well, I guess, I should
go out there and talk to her,

38:03.926 --> 38:07.195
even though I don't wanna
really hear what she has to say.

38:07.229 --> 38:10.932
I don't know Jack, I think you
should hear whatever she has to say.

38:10.967 --> 38:13.134
Okay, well, thanks. For nothing.

38:24.080 --> 38:26.815
Hey!

38:26.849 --> 38:31.186
I saved you some dinner. It's over
there on the stove. Where were you?

38:31.220 --> 38:32.854
Uh, talking to Adrian.

38:32.888 --> 38:34.155
- Oh, at school?
- Yeah.

38:35.257 --> 38:37.892
Look, if you don't love me and

38:37.927 --> 38:41.162
you don't want to marry me and you
want to go off to school on your own,

38:41.197 --> 38:42.163
you should tell me.

38:45.001 --> 38:47.802
That's what Adrian said that you said.

38:47.837 --> 38:50.205
Jack, that's just a ridiculous lie.

38:50.239 --> 38:53.942
That's just a horrible,
horrible, mean, vicious lie!

38:53.976 --> 38:56.077
That's what she said. Why would
she make up something like that?

38:56.112 --> 38:58.947
- Yeah, why would she?
- Did she and Omar break up or something?

38:58.981 --> 39:00.915
Yeah, she broke up with him.

39:00.950 --> 39:02.784
- Adrian broke up with Omar.
- Yeah.

39:03.953 --> 39:05.987
Oh, I get it.

39:06.022 --> 39:07.088
She's still in love with me.

39:08.024 --> 39:10.125
She's in love with you?

39:10.159 --> 39:11.993
Yes, I never should have kissed her.
I'm telling you, she's in love with me.

39:12.028 --> 39:13.862
And she broke up with Omar and now she's

39:13.896 --> 39:15.864
trying to break us up because
she's still in love with me!

39:15.898 --> 39:17.098
Well, she must be in love with Amy too,

39:17.133 --> 39:19.034
because she told Ricky that
Amy's not in love with him

39:19.068 --> 39:20.835
and she doesn't want to marry him.

39:22.004 --> 39:24.105
Excuse me, I just want to text...

39:24.874 --> 39:26.174
Tom.

39:26.208 --> 39:29.978
I was in the middle of
texting Tom when you came in.

39:30.012 --> 39:32.080
Just one second.

39:42.224 --> 39:43.258
What's going on?

39:43.292 --> 39:46.061
Um, oh, just...

39:46.095 --> 39:48.129
nothing, there's just this really...

39:48.164 --> 39:50.832
you know, this ad for shoes.

39:50.866 --> 39:52.067
It's just unbelievable sale.

39:52.101 --> 39:54.069
Must be. You dropped your book.

39:55.104 --> 39:57.138
Yeah.

39:57.173 --> 39:59.240
Yeah, I mean, I mean, it's really a sale.

39:59.275 --> 40:01.876
Hey, do you want some like,
uh, dessert or anything?

40:01.911 --> 40:03.878
Like some ice cream or something?

40:03.913 --> 40:04.979
I think we have some ice cream.

40:05.014 --> 40:06.815
Yeah, but I don't really
want anything to eat.

40:06.849 --> 40:07.916
I think I'm going to go to bed soon.

40:07.950 --> 40:09.250
I've got that final tomorrow.

40:09.285 --> 40:11.152
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We
should just go to bed then.

40:11.187 --> 40:13.221
Yeah. We should.

40:13.255 --> 40:14.989
If you don't need to study.

40:15.024 --> 40:17.158
No, I studied, I'm ready.

40:19.862 --> 40:21.830
Um...

40:21.864 --> 40:25.200
did anything else happen at school
today, other than Clementine coming back?

40:25.234 --> 40:28.803
Nope, nothing that I think would
interest you, just school stuff.

40:28.838 --> 40:32.774
All right, thanks again for
telling me about Clementine.

40:32.808 --> 40:35.777
I think it's really important for
us to be honest with each other.

40:35.811 --> 40:38.880
Yeah, especially with us getting
married and your going away to school.

40:38.914 --> 40:39.914
Yeah.

40:39.949 --> 40:40.949
I love you.

40:40.983 --> 40:42.083
I love you too.

40:42.118 --> 40:46.755
Oh, geez, I did forget
something. Something big.

40:46.789 --> 40:47.956
- What?
- I can't believe

40:47.990 --> 40:50.058
I didn't tell you. Leo came by.

40:50.092 --> 40:52.761
Oh, oh, gosh, yeah, that's right, uh,

40:52.795 --> 40:54.896
- did you get a raise or something?
- No.

40:54.930 --> 40:57.999
He actually came by to tell me something
that he wanted me to discuss with you,

40:58.033 --> 40:59.901
something for you.

40:59.935 --> 41:01.836
Oh, really? What's that?

41:01.871 --> 41:03.037
He has a building in New York,

41:03.072 --> 41:05.073
a three family building.

41:05.107 --> 41:08.209
He's going to offer Ben the top floor
apartment and he's going to offer you

41:08.244 --> 41:10.945
the basement apartment, for four years.

41:10.980 --> 41:12.914
It's big enough for the three of us

41:12.948 --> 41:16.050
if we decide we don't like being apart
and John and I want to move to New York.

41:16.085 --> 41:18.820
Ricky, what? That's crazy.

41:18.854 --> 41:21.055
I don't want to live in the
same building as Ben Boykewich.

41:21.090 --> 41:22.924
I'm not worried about
it, I think it's fine,

41:22.958 --> 41:26.861
I'm not concerned about you and
Ben and it's a free apartment.

41:26.896 --> 41:30.265
It's a safe place for you and you'll have
people you know nearby if you need help,

41:30.299 --> 41:32.167
Leo's got family right there.

41:32.201 --> 41:34.803
I don't know, there's
got to be another way.

41:34.837 --> 41:40.108
I don't know another way, and you
want to be there, so what the heck?

41:40.142 --> 41:42.877
I don't know. Maybe Leo is
just trying to break us up.

41:42.912 --> 41:44.813
I don't think Leo is that kind of guy.

41:44.847 --> 41:48.149
I think he's just offering you an
opportunity and you should take it.

41:48.184 --> 41:50.118
I don't think there's
any other alternative.

41:50.152 --> 41:52.821
Well, my mom had offered her help but,

41:52.855 --> 41:56.124
then again, there's always strings attached
when she or my dad offer their help.

41:59.161 --> 42:03.097
So you really don't think
it would be a problem?

42:03.132 --> 42:05.200
I don't think it would be a problem.

42:05.234 --> 42:07.001
You're going to be my wife.
