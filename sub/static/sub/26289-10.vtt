00:01.566 --> 00:03.612
It's time to take a stand
withThe Gifted.

00:03.655 --> 00:06.310
-People need something
to believe in.
-Ahh!

00:06.354 --> 00:08.138
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.182 --> 00:10.271

andLethal Weapon.

00:13.230 --> 00:15.972
-Hey, partner.
-Only on Fox.

00:17.321 --> 00:20.194
LAUREN: You wouldn't recognize
Andy. He's different.

00:20.237 --> 00:21.238
CAITLIN:
I just can't let go

00:21.282 --> 00:23.284
of the idea that we can get
through to him.

00:23.327 --> 00:24.285
LAUREN:
You still don't get it.

00:24.328 --> 00:26.635
Andy doesn't want to be saved.

00:28.158 --> 00:30.465
People are getting busted
because of what we did.

00:30.508 --> 00:33.250
All right, if we don't hit
the Inner Circle right now,

00:33.294 --> 00:34.251
the Underground, it's over.

00:34.295 --> 00:37.037
Why don't you go enjoy
your lonely crusade

00:37.080 --> 00:39.213
while I fix the mess
that you made?

00:39.256 --> 00:41.171
-Just give her to me.
-How are you gonna
keep her safe?

00:41.215 --> 00:43.304
I'll figure it out.
That's what parents do.

00:43.347 --> 00:44.609
Look, I didn't
come here to fight.

00:44.653 --> 00:46.959
I came to let you say goodbye.

00:47.003 --> 00:49.049
TWIST: Reeva already
tracked me down once.

00:49.092 --> 00:50.746
We have to take care of her.

00:50.789 --> 00:53.618
Rebecca, don't!

00:55.316 --> 00:56.795
THUNDERBIRD:
It's the Purifiers.

00:56.839 --> 00:58.667
I'll hold them off. Go!

00:58.710 --> 01:00.190
Go, now!

01:08.198 --> 01:10.200
Gotcha.

01:15.423 --> 01:17.033
Four, corner pocket.

01:21.907 --> 01:23.866
It's all over but the crying.

01:23.909 --> 01:25.389
Okay.

01:25.433 --> 01:28.218
♪ Working
while they're sleeping♪

01:28.262 --> 01:29.698
♪ Now you know
I'm ready to fly♪

01:31.308 --> 01:32.657
Nice.

01:33.789 --> 01:35.834
Except, uh, it turns out

01:35.878 --> 01:38.968
that the cue ball
in pay tables is magnetic.

01:39.011 --> 01:40.535
-That's how the table knows
to give it back to you

01:40.578 --> 01:42.189
when you scratch.

01:43.364 --> 01:45.366
Magnetic ball...

01:53.330 --> 01:55.376
...means I always win.

01:55.419 --> 01:56.899
ECLIPSE:
What did I tell you, man?

01:56.942 --> 01:58.901
Never ever play pool with Lorna.

02:00.207 --> 02:02.687
You two been playing a lot?

02:02.731 --> 02:04.167
Uh, I don't know.

02:04.211 --> 02:05.995
-Some.
-Yeah?

02:06.038 --> 02:07.388
Got anything
you want to tell me?

02:07.431 --> 02:10.434
-About what?
-What do you...
what do you mean?

02:10.478 --> 02:11.348
THUNDERBIRD: You know
I can hear your heartbeats

02:11.392 --> 02:13.307
get faster when
you're around each other, right?

02:14.743 --> 02:17.398
-Well, maybe we find
each other annoying.
-I also heard

02:17.441 --> 02:18.747
what you guys whispered to
each other when I was at the bar

02:18.790 --> 02:20.314
-buying the beers.
-Oh, wow.

02:20.357 --> 02:23.404
-Wow.
-All right, uh...

02:23.447 --> 02:24.970
It's your fault, John.

02:25.014 --> 02:26.233
-Okay?

02:26.276 --> 02:27.277
I was against recruiting him
for the Underground.

02:27.321 --> 02:28.670
You insisted.

02:28.713 --> 02:30.454
-I felt sorry for him.
-Oh, wow.

02:30.498 --> 02:32.500
-You felt sorry for me?
I had money back then.

02:32.543 --> 02:34.284
-And I had clean clothes,
hot showers.
-Mmm.

02:34.328 --> 02:37.157
It was... it was awful.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.028
-Mmm.
-Yeah.

02:39.071 --> 02:41.639
-All right.
-I am sorry.

02:41.683 --> 02:43.424
-We should've told you, man.
-It's fine.

02:43.467 --> 02:45.904
Even if I wanted to,
I don't think I'm strong enough

02:45.948 --> 02:47.471
to keep the two of you apart.

02:47.515 --> 02:49.778
But I want you
to remember something here.

02:49.821 --> 02:51.301
What we're doing right now

02:51.345 --> 02:54.783
with the Underground
is dangerous.

02:54.826 --> 02:57.307
The day will come
when our lives are on the line.

02:57.351 --> 03:00.354
And on that day
we can't afford secrets.

03:00.397 --> 03:03.487
We need to be able
to depend on each other 100%.

03:05.576 --> 03:07.752
1,000%.

03:09.450 --> 03:10.886
Always.

03:10.929 --> 03:12.409
♪ Yeah, it's all right♪

03:12.453 --> 03:15.151
To us.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.848
-♪ On the open road.♪
-Yeah.

04:07.682 --> 04:10.946
Andy. What are you doing here?

04:13.035 --> 04:15.690
-Is this where you live?
-Yeah.

04:15.733 --> 04:17.518
What's going on?

04:17.561 --> 04:19.694
I... I just came to talk.

04:19.737 --> 04:20.999
You attacked me.

04:21.043 --> 04:24.002
Hey, can we not go there now?

04:24.046 --> 04:28.920
This place, whatever it is,
the... the dreams...

04:28.964 --> 04:31.445
Can we just talk
like we used to?

04:32.881 --> 04:34.448
Nothing's like it used to be.

04:34.491 --> 04:36.711
-I know, but...
-You made a choice.

04:36.754 --> 04:38.452
Yeah, and I believe

04:38.495 --> 04:40.236
in what we're doing.
It's just...

04:40.280 --> 04:42.369
it's hard sometimes.

04:42.412 --> 04:45.894
You know, I-I've...
I've lost a lot.

04:45.937 --> 04:48.331
You want me
to make you feel better

04:48.375 --> 04:49.811
about joining the Inner Circle?

04:49.854 --> 04:52.466
No, you... you don't understand.

04:52.509 --> 04:54.424
We're actually building
something special,

04:54.468 --> 04:56.426
a-and they've made me
so much stronger

04:56.470 --> 04:58.080
than I used to be.
The things I can do...

04:58.123 --> 05:00.343
If it's so great,

05:00.387 --> 05:01.562
why do you seem so sad?

05:01.605 --> 05:04.956
-I'm not...
-Yes, you are. I can feel it.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.438
Why do you have to be like this,
huh? Why can't we just talk?

05:08.482 --> 05:10.527
You want your family back?

05:10.571 --> 05:12.573
Come home.

05:12.616 --> 05:14.879
You know I can't do that.

05:14.923 --> 05:17.404
Well, then, I guess
there's nothing to talk about.

05:17.447 --> 05:19.493
Just listen to me!

05:24.236 --> 05:25.499
Another dream?

05:25.542 --> 05:28.371
-Yeah.
-What was this one?

05:28.415 --> 05:32.332
It was Andy.
He came to the apartment,

05:32.375 --> 05:33.724
wanted to talk.

05:33.768 --> 05:35.030
He seems really hurt.

05:35.073 --> 05:36.771
Sad inside.

05:38.425 --> 05:40.252
If he's really that unhappy,

05:40.296 --> 05:41.732
maybe he's having
second thoughts.

05:41.776 --> 05:44.431
I don't know, Mom.
I-I don't think so.

05:44.474 --> 05:46.607
Well, at least
he's reaching out.

05:46.650 --> 05:49.610
He mostly just seems lost.

05:51.220 --> 05:53.614
He's wanting to drag me
into the darkness with him.

05:55.659 --> 05:59.707
If what Madeline said is true,
if your connection with Andy

05:59.750 --> 06:02.362
builds when you use
your powers together,

06:02.405 --> 06:05.365
these dreams could be
his path out of that darkness.

06:05.408 --> 06:07.018
You have to be stronger
than him, Lauren.

06:07.062 --> 06:08.716
I'm trying.

06:08.759 --> 06:10.413
We know.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.333
It's-it's Marcos.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.683
I thought he said to wait
to call him till we got back.

06:19.727 --> 06:21.424
He did.

06:21.468 --> 06:23.861
Hey.

06:23.905 --> 06:26.298
What? When?

06:28.736 --> 06:30.781
All right.
We're on our way back.

06:33.741 --> 06:35.699
It's the Purifiers.

06:35.743 --> 06:37.440
They've captured John.

06:43.968 --> 06:45.840
ECLIPSE:
Here's the situation.

06:45.883 --> 06:47.668
We've called everyone
in the Underground

06:47.711 --> 06:50.540
who's still picking up
and asked if they can find John.

06:50.584 --> 06:52.281
I even reached out
to the Morlocks,

06:52.324 --> 06:53.630
and no one knows anything.

06:53.674 --> 06:55.197
So that's it? There's no one?

06:55.240 --> 06:57.329
ECLIPSE:
Well, not quite.

06:57.373 --> 06:59.680
We have him.

07:01.333 --> 07:04.032
Maybe we can use him
to reach out to Lorna

07:04.075 --> 07:06.208
-for help.
-Are you joking?

07:06.251 --> 07:08.863
You're gonna ask
the Inner Circle for help?

07:08.906 --> 07:10.081
What else can we do, Lauren?

07:10.125 --> 07:12.040
How about anything else?

07:12.083 --> 07:14.434
They sent an assassin
to the clinic.

07:14.477 --> 07:16.479
They're the reason
we're in this disaster.

07:16.523 --> 07:18.394
I hate this more than anyone,
but they have resources.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.831
Maybe we can trade him
for information. I...

07:20.875 --> 07:23.573
I know we're desperate,
but they can't be trusted.

07:23.617 --> 07:25.662
-Not even for a second.
-Look, none of us trust them,

07:25.706 --> 07:27.534
but under the circumstance,

07:27.577 --> 07:29.361
they're our only hope
of getting John back.

07:33.278 --> 07:37.108
Look, Lorna cared for John once,

07:37.152 --> 07:41.548
and I have to believe
that part of her still does.

07:41.591 --> 07:44.725
What do you think, Clarice?

07:44.768 --> 07:45.639
Your call.

07:47.684 --> 07:51.819
The idea of depending on Lorna
makes my skin crawl.

07:51.862 --> 07:56.084
But this might be
John's only chance.

07:59.827 --> 08:03.744
And over 6,000 criminal mutants have escaped.

08:03.787 --> 08:06.094
People are asking:
what's the endgame here?

08:06.137 --> 08:10.141
There is no endgame other than senseless slaughter.

08:10.185 --> 08:11.708
-How can they lie like that?
-RYAN: This is a nightmare.

08:11.752 --> 08:13.188
Most of those people
were innocent.

08:13.231 --> 08:15.886
You expect balanced reporting
from that guy?

08:15.930 --> 08:19.499
His entire career is built
on stirring up mutant haters.

08:19.542 --> 08:22.763
Yeah, but people are gonna be
watching that and believing it.

08:22.806 --> 08:24.982
I mean, we're-we're fighting
for innocent mutants.

08:25.026 --> 08:28.682
Andy, weknow.
Isn't that what's important?

08:28.725 --> 08:31.772
These mutants are convicted
murderers and rapists,

08:31.815 --> 08:32.990
and they're on the loose
in our neighborhoods.

08:33.034 --> 08:34.862
After everything we sacrificed.

08:34.905 --> 08:36.777
RYAN: That's the time
when regular citizens step up.

08:36.820 --> 08:38.779
We should make them
tell the truth.

08:38.822 --> 08:40.781
-RYAN: That's the American way.

08:40.824 --> 08:43.610
It's the only way.

08:43.653 --> 08:45.699
What is it?

08:45.742 --> 08:49.354
I, uh, I think it's Fade.
Why's he calling me?

08:49.398 --> 08:50.834
Hello.

08:50.878 --> 08:52.575
-Lorna, I need your help.
-Uh-uh-uh-uh.

08:52.619 --> 08:54.751
-Fade?
-ECLIPSE: It's me.

08:54.795 --> 08:55.709
We need to talk.

08:55.752 --> 08:58.712
What? Marcos?
What's going on?

08:58.755 --> 09:00.104
ECLIPSE:
Oh, nobody told you?

09:00.148 --> 09:02.846
Fade was sent to kill someone
we were talking to.

09:02.890 --> 09:04.718
Didn't quite pull off
the getaway.

09:04.761 --> 09:07.416
You want him back?
Meet me

09:07.459 --> 09:09.287
at the old mall parking lot.

09:09.331 --> 09:11.942
Off 17th. 10:00. Alone.

09:20.429 --> 09:21.996
-Comfortable?
-Mm.

09:22.039 --> 09:23.824
Cool.

09:23.867 --> 09:26.783
-I'm coming with you.
-What? W... Hey.

09:26.827 --> 09:29.003
What-what? No, no, no. No, no.
I told Lorna it'd just be

09:29.046 --> 09:30.570
-me and her.
-What am I supposed to do?

09:30.613 --> 09:32.789
Just sit back and wait?
Come on, part of the reason why

09:32.833 --> 09:35.226
-John's in this mess
is because of me.
-That isn't true.

09:35.270 --> 09:37.925
Yeah, it is. I'm the one
that yelled at him and bailed.

09:37.968 --> 09:39.317
You know,
I should have been there

09:39.361 --> 09:40.841
-when the Purifiers showed up.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.

09:40.884 --> 09:42.625
Hey, look, Clarice,
this is not your fault.

09:42.669 --> 09:44.888
The question is
whether we can trust Lorna.

09:44.932 --> 09:47.021
And if we can,
I have to be the one

09:47.064 --> 09:49.023
that looks her in the eye
and convinces her to help us.

09:49.066 --> 09:51.765
-And if we can't?
-Then I'm walking into a trap,

09:51.808 --> 09:54.071
and you're John's only chance.

09:56.813 --> 09:58.772
Don't screw this up.

09:58.815 --> 10:00.600
Never.

10:22.883 --> 10:24.972
Looking for your lost assassin?

10:25.015 --> 10:26.713
Ah, don't worry.

10:26.756 --> 10:28.192
-He's in here.

10:28.236 --> 10:30.238
Marcos, I swear I had no idea.

10:30.281 --> 10:32.588
I need to talk to you
about something.

10:32.632 --> 10:35.460
Look, if this is about Dawn,
I can't, okay? It's...

10:35.504 --> 10:37.898
-it's too painful.
-It's not that, no.

10:38.942 --> 10:41.075
Then what is it?

10:41.118 --> 10:43.425
It's John.
He's been kidnapped.

10:43.468 --> 10:46.602
What? What? Who-who...

10:46.646 --> 10:47.908
The Purifiers took him.
We don't know where.

10:47.951 --> 10:49.518
And we thought your friends

10:49.561 --> 10:51.520
might be able
to help us find him.

10:51.563 --> 10:54.305
Come on, Marcos, what makes you
think that they can find him?

10:54.349 --> 10:55.742
They tracked me down in a diner.

10:55.785 --> 10:57.004
Okay, yeah,
but this is different.

10:57.047 --> 10:59.136
-I can't just...
-I'm just asking you to try.

11:01.008 --> 11:03.227
Look, we're running out of time
here. John'll never crack.

11:03.271 --> 11:05.447
He's gonna make the Purifiers
kill him.

11:06.883 --> 11:09.756
Years ago we made a promise,

11:09.799 --> 11:12.106
Lorna, that we'd be there
for him when the day came.

11:14.282 --> 11:15.762
You have to remember that.

11:27.382 --> 11:28.905
PURIFIER:
All right, here we go.

11:30.733 --> 11:32.474
Watch him now.

11:32.517 --> 11:33.823
Get up.

11:36.086 --> 11:38.567
Now.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.792
John Proudstar...

11:45.835 --> 11:48.882
aka Thunderbird.

11:48.925 --> 11:51.885
It's nice to finally
meet you, man.

11:51.928 --> 11:53.800
We got a lot to talk about.

12:01.764 --> 12:03.157
How you feeling?

12:03.200 --> 12:05.899
Like I got hit by a truck.

12:14.777 --> 12:16.518
All right, so what now?

12:16.561 --> 12:18.215
Kill me?

12:20.696 --> 12:22.742
Torture me?

12:24.918 --> 12:26.789
You know, I have been
hunting you

12:26.833 --> 12:28.617
a better part
of three years now.

12:28.660 --> 12:31.054
At Sentinel Services,
I read your file so many times,

12:31.098 --> 12:33.317
the damn thing is...

12:33.361 --> 12:35.972
burned into my brain.

12:36.016 --> 12:38.932
Two tours in Afghanistan
with the Marine Mutant Corps.

12:38.975 --> 12:40.237
Five Medals of Bravery.

12:42.457 --> 12:44.459
You bled for this country.

12:46.156 --> 12:48.855
Thing is,
there's a new war going on

12:48.898 --> 12:50.857
and you ended up
on the wrong side of it.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.989
So I am here

12:53.033 --> 12:55.862
to offer you a chance
to save your soul.

12:55.905 --> 12:58.778
My soul is doing fine, thanks.

12:58.821 --> 13:00.388
JACE:
Is it?

13:00.431 --> 13:02.869
The last time I checked, we got
people dying in the streets.

13:02.912 --> 13:05.654
-We got mutant terrorists...
-Terrorists?

13:05.697 --> 13:07.134
We're fighting for our freedom.

13:07.177 --> 13:09.179
What you're doing
is ripping this country apart,

13:09.223 --> 13:11.399
and that won't end until

13:11.442 --> 13:12.661
the Mutant Underground
is destroyed.

13:12.704 --> 13:13.880
I will never tell you anything

13:13.923 --> 13:15.882
about the Mutant Underground.

13:15.925 --> 13:19.059
WILSON: Looks like we have
a difference of opinion.

13:19.102 --> 13:20.582
'Cause I think you will.

13:26.153 --> 13:28.024
After three years,
don't you think maybe it's time

13:28.068 --> 13:30.592
you stop and you ask yourself...

13:30.635 --> 13:32.899
what you're doing?

13:32.942 --> 13:33.943
Huh?

13:33.987 --> 13:35.292
Running around
with a hate group?

13:37.033 --> 13:39.906
Maybe I'm not the one
whose soul needs saving.

13:41.385 --> 13:43.953
I'm not the one
that killed 37 people

13:43.997 --> 13:45.999
in Creed Financial, people
whose children will grow...

13:46.042 --> 13:47.478
We didn't kill those people.

13:47.522 --> 13:50.003
-We had nothing to do with that.
-JACE: All right.

13:50.046 --> 13:52.048
You're not ready
to tell the truth.

13:52.092 --> 13:55.399
I'll give you a chance
to think it over.

13:58.011 --> 13:59.621
As I recall,
you have some sort of...

13:59.664 --> 14:01.057
super hearing, right?

14:05.105 --> 14:07.107
-Here's a little thinking music.

14:14.244 --> 14:16.203
♪ Black out the light,
just another fix♪

14:16.246 --> 14:18.074
♪ Into another life
with a single prick♪

14:18.118 --> 14:19.380
♪ You give everything...♪

14:19.423 --> 14:21.469
It's like mutants didn't get
the truth gene.

14:21.512 --> 14:24.080
Uh, he'll open up.
It's early days.

14:24.124 --> 14:26.343
Just got to break him down.

14:26.387 --> 14:29.390
With all due respect, I think
it's time we stop babying him.

14:29.433 --> 14:32.132
Sure, he's super strong,
but everybody bleeds.

14:32.175 --> 14:33.437
Let's use the power tools.

14:33.481 --> 14:34.917
We want him cooperating,

14:34.961 --> 14:36.353
-not screaming his head off.
-Well, it seems

14:36.397 --> 14:38.355
-to me he could do both.
-No.

14:39.748 --> 14:42.142
It might take
a little bit, but...

14:42.185 --> 14:44.057
but we'll get
what we're looking for.

14:51.847 --> 14:54.502
Is this, uh... roof taken,

14:54.545 --> 14:56.678
or should I find
some other place

14:56.721 --> 14:58.941
to be anxious and miserable?

14:58.985 --> 15:00.508
There's room for two.

15:09.256 --> 15:12.085
I know you hate Marcos going
to the Inner Circle.

15:12.128 --> 15:15.915
It's one of my least
favorite ideas ever.

15:15.958 --> 15:19.048
But if anyone can find John,
it's them.

15:19.092 --> 15:23.183
You know, they've got
their own... Death Star.

15:25.315 --> 15:27.883
That's what I'm worried about.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.102
You're worried about that?

15:29.145 --> 15:31.234
I mean, don't you think
that we can just...?

15:31.278 --> 15:32.453
Yes, we do.

15:32.496 --> 15:34.629
Where does it stop?

15:34.672 --> 15:37.110
Their money, their power--

15:37.153 --> 15:39.242
it's the answer to everything.

15:39.286 --> 15:42.115
That's how they got Andy.

15:43.899 --> 15:46.597
That's why
I'm never gonna get him back.

15:46.641 --> 15:49.165
I hate everything
that they stand for,

15:49.209 --> 15:51.037
but do you really think
that your principles are worth

15:51.080 --> 15:52.864
-more than John's life?
-No... of course not.

15:52.908 --> 15:54.127
I'm just...

15:54.170 --> 15:55.911
I know.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.000
We will go back to battling
the Inner Circle later,

15:58.044 --> 16:00.568
but first...

16:00.611 --> 16:03.223
we just need to get John home.

16:13.276 --> 16:15.235
Hey.

16:15.278 --> 16:16.976
Anything on John?

16:20.196 --> 16:21.415
Yes.

16:21.458 --> 16:22.982
-I asked Sage

16:23.025 --> 16:26.420
to look into recent Purifier
activity, anything unusual.

16:26.463 --> 16:29.031
-She found this.
-What is it?

16:29.075 --> 16:30.554
It's a compound in Virginia.

16:30.598 --> 16:33.601
No activity until about an hour
after John's capture,

16:33.644 --> 16:35.298
and then this convoy shows up.

16:35.342 --> 16:36.647
He's in that building,

16:36.691 --> 16:38.649
but I've studied
the satellite photos.

16:38.693 --> 16:41.261
The place is a fortress. There's
no way they'll make it in.

16:41.304 --> 16:43.524
So what are we waiting for?
We got to help him.

16:43.567 --> 16:45.613
Andy, we can't.

16:45.656 --> 16:47.267
We're not part
of the Underground.

16:47.310 --> 16:51.314
So what? You said yourself
that they can't do it alone.

16:51.358 --> 16:53.229
How many times have we tried
to tell them

16:53.273 --> 16:54.883
that we're doing
something good here?

16:54.926 --> 16:56.493
Now we can show them.

16:56.537 --> 16:59.322
-Reeva won't like it.
-Won't like what--

16:59.366 --> 17:01.455
stopping mutant-haters
from killing mutants?

17:01.498 --> 17:03.848
That doesn't make any sense.
That's why we're here.

17:03.892 --> 17:08.070
When Sentinel Services was after
my family, John got us away.

17:08.114 --> 17:10.159
When you were in prison,
he got you out.

17:10.203 --> 17:13.075
He was there for us.

17:26.697 --> 17:29.048
You all right there?

17:29.091 --> 17:31.441
Yeah, just, uh...

17:31.485 --> 17:33.313
I-I had a dream
about this place.

17:33.356 --> 17:35.141
It's weird being here.

17:35.184 --> 17:37.230
Before we go up there,

17:37.273 --> 17:40.146
you have to remember
that today is about saving John.

17:40.189 --> 17:41.886
That's all.

17:41.930 --> 17:45.281
Yeah, but... I want to show them
what we're doing,

17:45.325 --> 17:46.891
-make them understand.
-Uh...

17:46.935 --> 17:48.763
I'm just trying to keep you
from getting hurt, Andy.

17:48.806 --> 17:52.506
When Marcos came to see Dawn,
do you have any idea how much

17:52.549 --> 17:54.377
I wanted
to see eye to eye with him?

17:54.421 --> 17:56.075
We love each other.
We always will.

17:56.118 --> 17:59.165
But... we will never

17:59.208 --> 18:01.210
agree on what we believe.

18:02.820 --> 18:05.040
Just... don't expect too much.

18:08.522 --> 18:10.611
BLINK:
This was supposed to be

18:10.654 --> 18:12.308
about finding John,

18:12.352 --> 18:13.918
and now you're just
letting her come over?

18:13.962 --> 18:15.572
It's not like
I printed up an invitation.

18:15.616 --> 18:17.313
-I just got a message.
-CAITLIN: Uh, okay.

18:17.357 --> 18:18.880
Sh-She'll be here soon.

18:18.923 --> 18:20.969
We all just need
to be on the s...

18:44.210 --> 18:46.037
-Oh, my... Andy.

18:47.952 --> 18:50.738
Oh, it's you.

18:50.781 --> 18:52.218
Yeah.

18:52.261 --> 18:54.350
Oh, my gosh, look at you.

18:54.394 --> 18:56.700
-Come on. Let him in.

18:56.744 --> 18:58.441
Let him in.

18:58.485 --> 19:00.443
How much you've grown.

19:00.487 --> 19:02.228
You look so different.
Come here.

19:02.271 --> 19:05.231
-It's been a while.

19:05.274 --> 19:07.755
-Your hair.
-Oh, come in. Come on.

19:09.844 --> 19:11.367
Hmm.

19:11.411 --> 19:15.154
I can't believe
you're here, in real life.

19:15.197 --> 19:18.026
Yeah, uh, it seemed crazy

19:18.069 --> 19:20.159
to let you guys go
after John alone, so...

19:20.202 --> 19:22.683
-So you found him?
-Yeah, we found him.

19:22.726 --> 19:24.511
If you think
that I'm gonna let the triplets

19:24.554 --> 19:26.034
or your lovely boss
anywhere near...

19:26.077 --> 19:28.993
Don't worry.
Just us today.

19:29.037 --> 19:31.257
So, all of a sudden,

19:31.300 --> 19:33.476
we're just a team again,
just like that?

19:33.520 --> 19:36.305
ANDY: The Purifiers are keeping
John a few hours away.

19:36.349 --> 19:38.786
We can just give you the address
if you want. I mean,

19:38.829 --> 19:40.309
if you want us to leave.

19:40.353 --> 19:42.659
-No.
-Don't be ridiculous.

19:42.703 --> 19:45.184
Clarice,

19:45.227 --> 19:47.403
we've seen what John's
up against.

19:47.447 --> 19:49.666
You're gonna need
all the help you can get.

19:52.843 --> 19:55.281
ANDY: Fully customized, armored,
top-of-the-line.

19:55.324 --> 19:56.847
They have four doors,
and they drive.

19:56.891 --> 19:58.458
They're cars, Andy.

19:58.501 --> 19:59.633
Not just cars.

19:59.676 --> 20:02.244
We've got guns
and equipment, too.

20:05.291 --> 20:08.859
POLARIS: And we brought everyone
flak jackets.

20:08.903 --> 20:10.992
Bulletproof.

20:11.035 --> 20:13.603
I remember when you used
to buy me ties for Christmas.

20:13.647 --> 20:16.084
-We're so glad you're here.

20:16.127 --> 20:17.477
Thank you.

20:22.612 --> 20:25.311
JACE: Where's the Underground
hitting next?

20:25.354 --> 20:28.096
We're not hittinganywhere.

20:28.139 --> 20:29.445
WILSON:
I'm telling you, Turner,

20:29.489 --> 20:30.533
we're being too delicate
with this guy.

20:30.577 --> 20:32.796
I've seen your
little videos, John.

20:32.840 --> 20:34.798
The Mutant Uprising.

20:34.842 --> 20:36.017
If you don't give me
something...

20:36.060 --> 20:37.453
I'm telling you the truth.

20:37.497 --> 20:39.455
We had nothing
to do with those attacks.

20:39.499 --> 20:41.457
We've been trying to stop 'em.

20:41.501 --> 20:45.505
Oh, right. Mutants fighting
each other to save humans.

20:45.548 --> 20:48.595
Seriously, Turner,
this is comedy gold.

20:48.638 --> 20:50.597
We smuggle mutants
across the border!

20:50.640 --> 20:53.687
We don't make hostage videos
and slaughter innocent people!

20:53.730 --> 20:55.515
Well, maybe
you're getting desperate.

20:56.907 --> 20:59.997
Maybe after
the Atlanta disaster,

21:00.041 --> 21:02.130
you realized
the walls were closing in.

21:03.392 --> 21:05.220
Wouldn't be

21:05.264 --> 21:06.700
the first time a terrorist group
took it up a notch

21:06.743 --> 21:08.136
when things got bad.

21:08.179 --> 21:09.703
You stopped saving mutant lives,

21:09.746 --> 21:11.357
started ending human ones.

21:20.496 --> 21:22.455
It's the Inner Circle.

21:22.498 --> 21:24.326
What?

21:24.370 --> 21:27.155
The group attacking those places

21:27.198 --> 21:29.723
is called the Inner Circle.

21:32.160 --> 21:35.250
The Inner Circle?

21:35.294 --> 21:36.599
I've never heard of it.

21:36.643 --> 21:38.601
Yeah, no one has.

21:38.645 --> 21:41.909
Anyone who looks into them--
they wind up dead.

21:41.952 --> 21:43.389
-Really?
-Yeah.

21:43.432 --> 21:45.434
You know, 'cause I've been
studying the attack,

21:45.478 --> 21:47.436
and word is,
there was a kid there,

21:47.480 --> 21:49.743
mutant kid with kinetic powers.

21:49.786 --> 21:53.137
There was also a woman
that could control metal.

21:53.181 --> 21:54.922
That sound like anybody
you know?

21:54.965 --> 21:58.404
Maybe Lorna Dane
and Andrew Strucker?

22:00.623 --> 22:02.930
Yeah.

22:02.973 --> 22:05.280
So the attack
that you say has nothing to do

22:05.324 --> 22:07.108
with the Mutant Underground
somehow involves

22:07.151 --> 22:09.719
two major members
of the Mutant Underground.

22:11.591 --> 22:13.680
If you're gonna try
to lie your way through this,

22:13.723 --> 22:15.508
you're gonna have
to do a much better job.

22:15.551 --> 22:17.466
I'm not lying.

22:18.467 --> 22:20.426
All right.

22:20.469 --> 22:22.558
Guess the only other question
I have for you is:

22:22.602 --> 22:24.212
are you ready to rock?

22:28.216 --> 22:30.349
I'm telling you the truth!

22:33.482 --> 22:35.571
-♪ Fall to disgrace♪

22:35.615 --> 22:38.313
♪ Now you're dead and gone!♪

22:40.489 --> 22:42.752
♪ You caught me
with my eyes closed♪

22:42.796 --> 22:44.885
♪ Baby, I was dreaming of you♪

22:44.928 --> 22:46.843
♪ I was dreaming of you♪

22:46.887 --> 22:50.499
♪ Oh, oh, you caught me
with my eyes closed♪

22:50.543 --> 22:52.893
♪ Baby, I was thinking
of you...♪

22:52.936 --> 22:56.113
-What are you doing?
-You like that song?

22:56.157 --> 22:58.725
No, but it's better
than silence.

23:03.033 --> 23:05.471
Did you get the picture of Dawn?

23:05.514 --> 23:06.602
Yeah.

23:06.646 --> 23:08.952
Thanks.

23:08.996 --> 23:10.650
If you didn't want me to come...

23:10.693 --> 23:12.216
-You're already here, okay,
so can we just...?
-Stop.

23:12.260 --> 23:14.610
Both of you.
We're about to take on

23:14.654 --> 23:16.830
a compound full
of mutant-hating hicks,

23:16.873 --> 23:19.354
and you two can't even
ride in a freakin' car together.

23:19.398 --> 23:20.660
-Clarice...
-Sorry.

23:24.228 --> 23:27.014
John's all alone right now
and he needs us.

23:27.057 --> 23:30.191
I think you could
set aside your issues

23:30.234 --> 23:32.411
for a few hours.

23:33.673 --> 23:36.458
Yeah, I guess we can fake it.

23:36.502 --> 23:38.460
Till we're done.

23:38.504 --> 23:41.681
Then you can go
right back to hating me.

23:41.724 --> 23:43.509
Deal.

23:43.552 --> 23:45.641
Thank you.

23:52.561 --> 23:55.651
I can't believe you're driving.

23:55.695 --> 23:58.393
You really missed out

23:58.437 --> 24:00.395
on me teaching you
in our old minivan.

24:00.439 --> 24:01.396
Yeah.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.658
We got a bunch of cars.

24:02.702 --> 24:04.181
Took a couple crushed bumpers,

24:04.225 --> 24:07.054
but I got the hang of it.

24:07.097 --> 24:08.664
You know, a lot of things
have changed

24:08.708 --> 24:11.624
since we all left Atlanta.
We'vechanged.

24:11.667 --> 24:13.843
Yeah? How so?

24:13.887 --> 24:15.192
REED:
I never really understood

24:15.236 --> 24:18.152
how it felt for you
to have powers,

24:18.195 --> 24:20.589
what that was like.

24:20.633 --> 24:22.896
But when you left...

24:22.939 --> 24:25.681
my X-Gene started to manifest.

24:26.813 --> 24:30.033
Wait, what?
You have powers?

24:30.077 --> 24:31.774
Lauren, why didn't you
tell me this?

24:31.818 --> 24:34.255
You mean in our dreams?

24:34.298 --> 24:36.692
Sorry, didn't come up.

24:37.693 --> 24:40.566
Well, that's crazy, Dad,
but it's cool.

24:40.609 --> 24:41.871
Welcome to the club.

24:41.915 --> 24:43.917
Yeah, I wish it was like that.

24:43.960 --> 24:45.919
What do you mean?

24:45.962 --> 24:47.486
What are your powers?

24:47.529 --> 24:48.704
REED:
I was, um...

24:48.748 --> 24:50.750
I was destroying things.

24:50.793 --> 24:53.230
My abilities
had been suppressed for so long

24:53.274 --> 24:54.928
that when they came out...

24:54.971 --> 24:58.584
-they were out of control.
-But we found some medication.

24:58.627 --> 25:00.716
It seems to be working for now.

25:00.760 --> 25:03.545
-For now?
-REED: Anyway, the point is,

25:03.589 --> 25:06.200
I know what you've
been going through.

25:08.594 --> 25:10.291
Look...

25:10.334 --> 25:12.336
Andy, we've all grown.

25:12.380 --> 25:14.382
We should be together
as a family.

25:14.425 --> 25:18.647
-If you would just come back...
-Mom, please don't ask me that.

25:30.616 --> 25:32.313
♪ Hey! Hey!♪

25:32.356 --> 25:34.620
♪ Hey! Hey! Hey!♪

25:41.670 --> 25:43.150
Aw...

25:43.193 --> 25:45.239
where's your friend?

25:45.282 --> 25:48.808
The truth is,
he's outside thinking of...

25:48.851 --> 25:51.462
interesting things to do
with power tools.

25:51.506 --> 25:53.856
Which is why you need
to believe me

25:53.900 --> 25:57.381
when I say
this is your last chance.

25:57.425 --> 25:59.601
You got to give me something.

26:02.822 --> 26:04.650
Wow.

26:06.782 --> 26:08.567
All right.

26:10.090 --> 26:11.787
You know,
I'll-I'll give you this:

26:11.831 --> 26:15.225
you were right about me.

26:15.269 --> 26:17.880
These last few years...

26:17.924 --> 26:21.623
have been pretty rough.

26:21.667 --> 26:25.584
I lost my kid, I lost my wife,
I lost my job...

26:25.627 --> 26:27.237
Everything.

26:27.281 --> 26:30.023
I lost everything that I had.

26:30.066 --> 26:32.416
All for the cause.

26:32.460 --> 26:35.376
A lot like you, I guess.

26:35.419 --> 26:36.725
No.

26:36.769 --> 26:39.206
I didn't trade everything
for hate.

26:39.249 --> 26:40.773
Well, you can call it
what you want,

26:40.816 --> 26:42.035
but you believe in
what you believe in.

26:42.078 --> 26:44.559
So do I.
And we're both paying for it.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.692
I mean, look at you--
your network's falling apart,

26:46.735 --> 26:48.389
your friends are beginning
to doubt you.

26:48.432 --> 26:51.087
It's lonely trying
to save the world, huh?

26:51.131 --> 26:53.829
Trying to protect it

26:53.873 --> 26:56.440
from people
that don't want to be protected.

27:00.706 --> 27:02.708
Why won't you help me

27:02.751 --> 27:05.058
stop people from dying
out there?

27:05.101 --> 27:06.668
I told you,
you're after the wrong people.

27:06.712 --> 27:08.496
You should be after
the Inner Circle.

27:08.539 --> 27:10.629
And I told you that
I know that you're lying.

27:10.672 --> 27:12.848
Andy Strucker and Lorna Dane
were at that bank.

27:12.892 --> 27:14.502
How do you explain that?

27:15.895 --> 27:17.244
What, they left
the Mutant Underground?

27:18.724 --> 27:20.508
Is that it?

27:24.817 --> 27:27.123
Okay, wait a minute.

27:28.864 --> 27:30.736
Did Lorna Dane and Andy Strucker

27:30.779 --> 27:32.781
make some new friends?

27:37.481 --> 27:38.831
Look...

27:38.874 --> 27:40.833
they made their choice.

27:40.876 --> 27:43.009
They joined the Inner Circle.

27:43.052 --> 27:45.446
We're trying to stop 'em.

27:46.752 --> 27:48.884
So they just...
they turned their back

27:48.928 --> 27:50.930
on the dream of the X-Men, huh?

27:52.540 --> 27:55.456
How the hell did that happen?

27:58.894 --> 28:01.114
Because I couldn't
make 'em believe.

28:02.855 --> 28:04.857
'Cause I failed.

28:10.993 --> 28:12.516
ECLIPSE: I hate to say this,
but this looks even worse

28:12.560 --> 28:14.214
than in the satellite photos.

28:14.257 --> 28:16.433
BLINK: Well, we didn't even know
where John was this morning.

28:16.477 --> 28:17.957
Let's just hurry up
and get over there.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.872
I used to deal with places
like this as a prosecutor.

28:19.915 --> 28:21.961
They can't afford
mutant protection systems,

28:22.004 --> 28:25.529
so they just plan
for any range of mutant attacks.

28:25.573 --> 28:28.750
Besides the armed guards
and the fence being electrified,

28:28.794 --> 28:29.795
it looks like
there's a minefield

28:29.838 --> 28:31.492
on the other side of the lake.

28:31.535 --> 28:33.015
Well, lucky
I can bend space-time.

28:33.059 --> 28:34.190
I can just portal us
past the minefield.

28:34.234 --> 28:35.757
Yeah, and pop out and get shot.

28:35.801 --> 28:36.932
There's an army over there.

28:36.976 --> 28:38.281
Lorna can handle
the bullets, right?

28:38.325 --> 28:40.240
-Mm-hmm.
-Well, there's a lot of bullets

28:40.283 --> 28:41.415
coming from a lot
of different places.

28:41.458 --> 28:43.373
There's a couple dozen
Purifiers in there.

28:43.417 --> 28:44.766
Then keep them busy
someplace else.

28:44.810 --> 28:46.333
We can't just give up on this.

28:46.376 --> 28:49.989
No one's saying that, all right?

28:50.032 --> 28:51.947
Lorna, you think we could attack
the other side of the compound

28:51.991 --> 28:53.819
-as a distraction?
-We could do that.

28:53.862 --> 28:56.082
Great.

28:56.125 --> 28:57.561
Andy, Lauren, come with me,

28:57.605 --> 28:58.780
help find John?

28:58.824 --> 29:00.303
Yep. Lauren?

29:01.609 --> 29:03.916
Yeah.

29:03.959 --> 29:04.917
CAITLIN:
We'll drive the cars around,

29:04.960 --> 29:06.092
keep them out of sight.

29:06.135 --> 29:07.571
We'll meet back here.

29:07.615 --> 29:09.660
Guys, you be careful, okay?

29:17.190 --> 29:18.713
JACE:
Inner Circle thing--

29:18.757 --> 29:20.367
I think it could be
something big.

29:20.410 --> 29:22.021
Could be.
Or-or it could be

29:22.064 --> 29:23.762
he's just trying to make us
chase our tails.

29:23.805 --> 29:26.068
All I know is if Lorna Dane
and Andrew Strucker left

29:26.112 --> 29:29.855
the Mutant Underground... a lot
of things start to line up.

29:37.471 --> 29:39.386
There's the back door.

29:39.429 --> 29:41.344
It's crawling with Purifiers.

29:41.388 --> 29:43.042
Hope Clarice
can find something better.

29:46.175 --> 29:48.787
Hey, you've been quiet.

29:50.005 --> 29:51.964
It's weird.

29:52.007 --> 29:54.096
Having you here in person.

29:54.140 --> 29:57.099
You're not happy about it?

29:57.143 --> 29:59.406
I just...

29:59.449 --> 30:01.408
don't believe it.

30:02.713 --> 30:04.193
You're talking to Mom and Dad

30:04.237 --> 30:06.195
like everything's so great
at the Inner Circle.

30:06.239 --> 30:08.415
But, Andy...

30:08.458 --> 30:10.069
I know.

30:10.112 --> 30:12.288
You're the one
that wanted to talk to me

30:12.332 --> 30:14.029
in that dream last night.

30:14.073 --> 30:15.857
Yeah, I was a little lonely.

30:15.901 --> 30:17.511
The Inner Circle's
still doing important stuff...

30:17.554 --> 30:19.339
Important stuff?

30:19.382 --> 30:21.907
How about that girl you broke
out of the mental hospital?

30:24.039 --> 30:25.998
She killed those people
at the bank, didn't she?

30:27.651 --> 30:29.610
It was a mistake.

30:29.653 --> 30:31.742
She lost control.

30:31.786 --> 30:34.397
You don't do something
that evil by accident.

30:34.441 --> 30:37.183
You don't know anything
about Rebecca.

30:37.226 --> 30:40.186
Her own parents turned her in
to Sentinel Services.

30:40.229 --> 30:42.884
They tortured her for years.

30:44.712 --> 30:47.106
And they broke her.

30:48.716 --> 30:52.241
We're fighting the people
who made her that way.

30:54.896 --> 30:56.855
So no more Rebeccas have to die.

30:58.117 --> 30:59.988
She died?

31:02.251 --> 31:03.992
How?

31:04.036 --> 31:06.473
No. I don't want
to talk about it.

31:07.778 --> 31:10.259
This spot's as good as it gets.

31:10.303 --> 31:12.696
Seriously?

31:14.089 --> 31:16.309
There are a dozen guys
guarding that door.

31:16.352 --> 31:19.051
Well, let's just hope that
Lorna and Marcos do their job.

31:19.094 --> 31:20.966
You guys ready?

31:25.579 --> 31:27.537
Let's start the fireworks.

31:31.846 --> 31:33.761
Okay, we're set.

31:36.459 --> 31:38.070
Where did you get that?

31:38.113 --> 31:40.072
-I made it.
-What?

31:40.115 --> 31:42.944
Remember the medallion
I got from my birth father?

31:42.988 --> 31:45.164
-Yeah, of course.
-Turned it into this.

31:45.207 --> 31:47.470
-Oh.
-You always said

31:47.514 --> 31:50.473
I should make peace
with my past, and I did.

31:50.517 --> 31:53.041
I like it.

31:53.085 --> 31:55.130
It looks badass.

31:55.174 --> 31:58.177
Keeps the hair out of my eyes.

31:58.220 --> 32:00.527
-You ready?
-Oh, electric fences,

32:00.570 --> 32:02.181
plastic explosives--
what's not to like?

32:02.224 --> 32:04.487
Let's make an entrance.

32:19.720 --> 32:21.156
-Over there!

32:21.200 --> 32:23.637
Well, that got their attention.

32:23.680 --> 32:24.812
Nothing we can't handle.

32:26.379 --> 32:28.163
PURIFIER:
What's that?!

32:32.602 --> 32:34.517
BLINK: It's working.
They're drawing the guards away.

32:43.265 --> 32:45.137
Little help?
There's more coming!

32:48.879 --> 32:51.491
PURIFIER:
Watch out!

33:07.333 --> 33:09.770
-What's going on?
-Couple muties going
straight through the minefield.

33:09.813 --> 33:11.598
-What?
-One ripped the fence open.

33:11.641 --> 33:14.122
The other's got
some kind of lasers.

33:14.166 --> 33:15.994
Let me see. Where?

33:19.867 --> 33:22.043
Son of a bitch.

33:24.872 --> 33:27.353
Son of a bitch!

33:33.924 --> 33:36.188
You think this is a game?

33:36.231 --> 33:38.886
I'm out there telling 'em
not to cut you to pieces...

33:38.929 --> 33:40.105
What are you talking about?

33:40.148 --> 33:42.063
You said Lorna Dane left
the Mutant Underground.

33:42.107 --> 33:44.065
-She did.
-Then why the hell
is she attacking our compound

33:44.109 --> 33:46.241
right now with Marcos Diaz?!

33:51.116 --> 33:53.031
You thought you could play me.

33:53.074 --> 33:54.293
You thought
you could play me.

33:56.338 --> 33:57.818
Hey. All right, hey.

33:57.861 --> 33:58.819
Never again.

33:58.862 --> 34:00.299
Come on.

34:06.087 --> 34:09.047
You people took everything
from me!

34:09.090 --> 34:12.224
You took everything from me!

34:13.312 --> 34:15.270
You people took my daughter.

34:15.314 --> 34:17.490
The mutants are through
the perimeter. Turner!

34:19.405 --> 34:20.928
What are you doing?

34:20.971 --> 34:22.234
You said you wanted
to keep him alive.

34:25.367 --> 34:27.891
I changed my mind.

34:38.946 --> 34:40.774
Hey!

34:43.820 --> 34:46.214
WOMAN:
They're inside!

34:52.264 --> 34:54.353
They're inside!

34:56.877 --> 34:58.096
Clarice!

35:04.319 --> 35:06.234
What the...?

35:06.278 --> 35:08.062
How'd that...?

35:08.106 --> 35:09.281
It's complicated.

35:09.324 --> 35:11.152
I'll explain later.

35:14.242 --> 35:16.853
-Jace, I know you're angry,

35:16.897 --> 35:17.941
but the mutants
are on their way.

35:17.985 --> 35:19.943
We got to get out
through the back now.

35:19.987 --> 35:22.076
I want you to know something.

35:22.120 --> 35:25.384
I'm gonna hunt down every
single one of your friends,

35:25.427 --> 35:26.950
and they're all gonna die.

35:35.872 --> 35:37.352
Okay, we got to go.

35:37.396 --> 35:40.790
We got to go.
No, no, no! We got to go! Now!

35:54.413 --> 35:56.806
Hey, handsome.

35:56.850 --> 35:58.156
You ready to go home?

35:58.199 --> 36:00.114
Yeah.

36:00.158 --> 36:02.160
Yeah.

36:24.225 --> 36:25.922
They're coming.
They've got John.

36:25.966 --> 36:26.923
John, hang in there.

36:26.967 --> 36:28.751
-We're almost there.

36:38.326 --> 36:40.328
You trying to kill my sister?!

36:42.069 --> 36:43.810
Shoot her in the back?!
You coward!

36:47.161 --> 36:49.207
What's he doing?

36:49.250 --> 36:50.599
LAUREN:
Andy, it's okay. Let it go.

36:50.643 --> 36:52.297
-Where do you think
you're going, man?

36:52.340 --> 36:53.863
LAUREN:
Andy, stop.

36:53.907 --> 36:56.823
- No!

36:58.390 --> 36:59.608
No, please.

36:59.652 --> 37:00.870
You're not so tough now,
are you?

37:00.914 --> 37:03.482
LAUREN:
Stop! Let him go!

37:03.525 --> 37:04.526
I'm okay.

37:08.487 --> 37:09.966
-No, no, no.
No, don't kill me, man.
-LAUREN: Andy.

37:10.010 --> 37:12.491
Stop it! Andy.

37:12.534 --> 37:15.407
Andy! Andy, come on!

37:15.450 --> 37:16.799
Let's go!

37:28.246 --> 37:29.986
-All right.

37:30.030 --> 37:31.466
-Come on.
-We did it. We made it out.

37:31.510 --> 37:33.903
Did you see that?

37:35.078 --> 37:36.906
That's what he gets for...

37:36.950 --> 37:38.473
messing with...

37:38.517 --> 37:39.474
ECLIPSE:
Let's go!

37:57.927 --> 37:58.928
Hey.

38:00.365 --> 38:02.323
Ted.

38:06.327 --> 38:07.415
Oh, my God.

38:07.459 --> 38:08.851
No, no. Don't try to move.

38:09.896 --> 38:11.811
What happened out there?

38:11.854 --> 38:13.160
They got away.

38:14.509 --> 38:15.510
How bad is it?

38:15.554 --> 38:17.643
Couple dead.
Probably two dozen hurt.

38:17.686 --> 38:20.646
You don't even want to know
what they did to Kyle.

38:20.689 --> 38:23.910
It's nothing compared
to what we're gonna do to them.

38:26.478 --> 38:28.871
This looks awful.

38:28.915 --> 38:31.134
One more shot
could've killed you.

38:32.179 --> 38:33.267
Sorry.

38:36.139 --> 38:38.620
Andy and Lorna...

38:38.664 --> 38:39.665
how?

38:41.667 --> 38:42.668
It's a long story.

38:46.672 --> 38:48.413
John, I'm s...

38:48.456 --> 38:50.589
I'm so sorry I wasn't there
when you got captured.

38:50.632 --> 38:51.546
-I should've...
-Clarice,

38:51.590 --> 38:53.113
hey.

38:54.201 --> 38:56.159
You saved me.

39:07.562 --> 39:09.564
-Hey, Andy, can we talk to you?

39:09.608 --> 39:11.740
ANDY:
There's nothing to talk about.

39:11.784 --> 39:14.482
I saw how you looked at me.

39:16.397 --> 39:17.572
CAITLIN:
I know you're upset,

39:17.616 --> 39:20.662
but... we love you.

39:20.706 --> 39:22.534
All of this time,
we have been trying

39:22.577 --> 39:25.014
to find you,
fighting to bring you home.

39:25.058 --> 39:26.799
You really think
that I'm just gonna abandon

39:26.842 --> 39:28.148
everything I believe in,

39:28.191 --> 39:29.410
everything I worked for?

39:29.454 --> 39:31.760
I-I know you think you're-you're
doing the right thing,

39:31.804 --> 39:34.067
that you're working
for some greater cause...

39:34.110 --> 39:35.808
Yeah. I'm not leaving
the Inner Circle.

39:35.851 --> 39:36.939
Andy...

39:37.853 --> 39:39.638
...we're just worried about you.

39:39.681 --> 39:41.204
That Purifier was trying

39:41.248 --> 39:43.337
to murder Lauren.
Do you know what him

39:43.381 --> 39:45.644
and his friends want to do
to mutants like us?

39:45.687 --> 39:46.471
They're monsters.

39:46.514 --> 39:47.428
Can you hear yourself?

39:47.472 --> 39:48.821
-I know that...
-No!

39:48.864 --> 39:50.257
Y-You don't know anything, okay?

39:50.300 --> 39:51.693
You don't get it.

39:51.737 --> 39:53.042
There's only one thing to do
to people like that,

39:53.086 --> 39:54.479
and it's wipe them out!

39:54.522 --> 39:56.394
End them!

39:56.437 --> 39:58.221
We can't afford to have them
running around, having

39:58.265 --> 40:00.049
more kids,
spreading their poison.

40:00.093 --> 40:01.573
LAUREN:
Andy,

40:01.616 --> 40:03.575
you don't believe that.

40:03.618 --> 40:05.577
You think you're better than me.

40:06.621 --> 40:09.145
I'm just doing
what has to be done.

40:09.189 --> 40:12.105
So I don't want to hear anything
from any of you.

40:12.148 --> 40:14.150
Andy. Andy!

40:16.631 --> 40:19.068
The only way
we're getting him back...

40:20.679 --> 40:23.333
...is if we destroy
the Inner Circle.

40:25.684 --> 40:27.860
I know.

40:35.607 --> 40:37.435
That was close.

40:37.478 --> 40:38.479
Yep.

40:43.876 --> 40:45.834
I should go.

40:45.878 --> 40:47.401
Yeah.

40:47.445 --> 40:48.707
Yeah, okay, then.

40:48.750 --> 40:51.231
Now we can, uh...
we can stop faking it.

40:51.274 --> 40:52.667
Yeah.

40:52.711 --> 40:54.626
Back to hating each other.

40:54.669 --> 40:56.454
Mm-hmm.

41:12.295 --> 41:14.863
