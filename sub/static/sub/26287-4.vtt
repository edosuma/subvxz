11:17.330 --> 11:18.750
I mean, it’s complete fiction.

11:18.750 --> 11:20.790
This is ridiculous.
His footprints

11:31.080 --> 11:33.910
You say overwhelming.
I give you the theory

11:33.910 --> 11:36.450
that the killer was
actually... a woman

11:36.450 --> 11:38.410
who wanted
vengeance on men

of the original victims

12:16.560 --> 12:19.190
was the district attorney

McGregor.

12:19.190 --> 12:21.440
He made the case
more high-profile.

And, before you ask,

12:23.020 --> 12:24.690
the answer is no.

12:24.690 --> 12:27.900
There was no rush to judgment.

14:48.940 --> 14:49.350
We never released

14:49.350 --> 14:52.940
that info to the public--
which raises questions,

like: How did
the killer know that?

What are we gonna tell

Nothing. Why?

as the evidence you brought me.

All of which pointed to Harrison
being guilty, and it still does.

other theories out there.

theory. Mm.
Yeah, grooming theory.

15:35.730 --> 15:37.940
Excuse me?
I mean, it’s
very possible

15:37.940 --> 15:39.100
that from
behind bars,

15:39.100 --> 15:41.100
Harrison is grooming someone

15:41.100 --> 15:41.940
to kill on his behalf.

15:41.940 --> 15:44.940
I mean, it’s not unheard
of with serial killers.
Yeah, and anyone

15:44.940 --> 15:47.850

the right one.

18:01.310 --> 18:03.600

of guarding Dan Harrison?

And the question

18:06.560 --> 18:08.440
Is he innocent?

18:08.440 --> 18:10.480
Well, Dan Harrison
should be free.

18:10.480 --> 18:14.650
Because he was
wrongfully convicted, right?

18:14.650 --> 18:17.230
Because he is misunderstood.

18:17.900 --> 18:18.350
Uh...

18:18.350 --> 18:20.730
because he’s innocent, yes?

Dan Harrison

18:25.310 --> 18:30.060
That womanizers deserve
to be punished.

18:30.060 --> 18:30.980
Uh...

18:30.980 --> 18:34.560

18:36.060 --> 18:39.690
Willing to do
what society was not.

who was the girlfriend of
the copycat killer’s victim,

18:55.690 --> 18:59.480

over there at East Side High?

Hey, Jacob?

20:17.270 --> 20:19.100
If you don’t mind
running out.

20:19.100 --> 20:20.980

20:20.980 --> 20:22.690

20:22.690 --> 20:25.900

20:25.900 --> 20:27.270
If you need to go
out or something,

20:27.270 --> 20:29.440
you just leave me here
and that’s fine.

You go ahead,
you take your time.
Okay.

20:31.940 --> 20:36.190

Oh, my God,

20:41.600 --> 20:44.690
I have just found
what appears very much to be

20:44.690 --> 20:48.650
a set of...
of blood-soaked gloves.

20:51.190 --> 20:55.980
That’s gonna be considered
People’s Exhibit A.

20:58.440 --> 21:02.190

I’ll go the back way.

21:06.150 --> 21:06.480
No, no. Please.

21:06.480 --> 21:09.940
I have... I have a wife who’s
about to maybe get out of jail.

21:09.940 --> 21:12.350
Please, could we just talk...
Freeze!

21:12.350 --> 21:13.480
Drop it!

21:13.480 --> 21:13.900
Hey.

21:13.900 --> 21:15.730
Come on, Jacob,
drop the knife.

21:15.730 --> 21:17.270
No one has to get hurt.

21:17.270 --> 21:18.980
Dan Harrison is a hero.

21:18.980 --> 21:23.480
He understands
Tell your listeners that.
Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah.

21:23.480 --> 21:24.480
Okay.

21:24.480 --> 21:27.100
Why don’t we both put
our weapons down together?

21:27.100 --> 21:30.650
Or-or maybe even just
he puts down his weapon.

21:33.150 --> 21:35.770
♪ ♪

21:41.310 --> 21:43.310
It’s okay, Leo.
We got him.

21:43.310 --> 21:45.100
It’s not okay.

21:45.100 --> 21:48.270
:
I wasn’t recording.

21:48.270 --> 21:49.650
Now I’m recording.

21:49.650 --> 21:52.560
Would you guys mind doing
one more of those?

21:52.980 --> 21:54.770
At that moment,
I knew that I was to become

21:54.770 --> 21:56.350
the killer’s next victim.

21:56.350 --> 21:59.310
And the last thing
that any podcaster wants...

21:59.310 --> 22:01.690
is to become part
of the narrative.

22:01.690 --> 22:05.650
Well, sources say Dan
Harrison groomed Jacob Porter

22:05.650 --> 22:06.900
to kill as he killed.

22:06.900 --> 22:08.560
Do you still claim
Dan is innocent?

22:08.560 --> 22:12.400
There are a lot of questions
that need to be answered,

22:12.400 --> 22:14.020
and my expert defense team

22:14.020 --> 22:15.480
will not rest until they are.

22:15.480 --> 22:18.560
Thank you. I’m...
And I’d also like to point out

22:18.560 --> 22:20.900
that this podcast
is brought to you

22:20.900 --> 22:23.600
by Marty’s Muffins.
Make it Marty’s Muffins,

22:23.600 --> 22:24.350
or make it nothin’.

22:24.350 --> 22:26.100
Marty’s Muffins,
the muffin of truth.

22:26.100 --> 22:30.810
Enter "Getz" in the box,
and you...
Marty’s Muffins?

22:33.230 --> 22:37.900
Are you part of
Leo’s defense team?

22:37.900 --> 22:41.480
I am Leo’s defense team.

22:41.480 --> 22:43.310
Honey, listen,

22:43.310 --> 22:46.190
he asked me for a favor,
and I’m just...

22:46.190 --> 22:47.520
I’m just looking over
some files.

22:47.520 --> 22:51.980
You know, his whole mission was
to prove me wrong and vilify me.

22:51.980 --> 22:53.060
Why would you help him do that?

22:53.060 --> 22:54.850
I don’t think
that was his mission.

22:54.850 --> 22:56.730
And even if it was,
it isn’t mine.

22:56.730 --> 23:00.100
Someone was gonna take
another look at your case,

23:00.100 --> 23:01.690
Roger, and for good reason.

23:01.690 --> 23:02.520
It didn’t have to be

23:02.520 --> 23:05.230
the lawyer that I
share a bed with.

23:05.230 --> 23:06.690
Well, better her than someone

23:06.690 --> 23:10.230
who doesn’t have
your best interests at heart.
Oh, well, lucky me.

23:10.230 --> 23:12.230
Yes. Lucky you.

23:12.230 --> 23:14.650
I am a damn good
defense attorney.

23:14.650 --> 23:15.480
How that... What?
And I can tell

23:15.480 --> 23:20.440
even a preliminary look
at Dan Harrison’s case files

23:20.440 --> 23:22.190
that he had a bad one.

23:22.190 --> 23:24.400
It doesn’t matter
who his lawyer was.

23:24.400 --> 23:27.230
Everyone knew he was guilty.
Okay, Roger,

23:27.230 --> 23:29.230
he says he had an alibi
for one of the murders.

23:29.230 --> 23:32.400
His attorney
didn’t even follow up.

23:32.400 --> 23:33.480
No case is perfect.

23:33.480 --> 23:36.690
You can always look
back and poke holes.

23:37.060 --> 23:40.190
Maybe you should try it.

24:00.400 --> 24:02.400
RAFI:Don’t come looking
for Hanni again.

24:02.400 --> 24:05.310
I don’t want him involved
in this anymore.
Okay.

24:05.310 --> 24:06.150
Look, I totally get it.

24:06.150 --> 24:09.690
But the intel’s he’s been able
to get has been very valuable.

24:09.690 --> 24:13.190
Valuable to you.
And to you and your brother.

24:13.190 --> 24:16.560
The information
he can provide...

24:16.560 --> 24:18.100
you guys can
leverage this thing.

24:18.100 --> 24:19.850
You don’t like to listen,
do you?

24:19.850 --> 24:22.770
I know you want
out of here, Rafi.

24:22.770 --> 24:24.980
Go to college,
maybe even the U.S.

24:24.980 --> 24:26.900
I can talk to my people,

24:26.900 --> 24:30.400
get you visas,
resettlement allowance.

24:30.400 --> 24:33.310
That’s a pretty
damn good trade.

24:36.190 --> 24:38.770
There’s a hard drive
we’re looking for.

24:38.770 --> 24:40.230
A lot of lives are at stake.

24:40.230 --> 24:43.690
Maybe Hanni can get a location.
We’re not interested.

24:43.690 --> 24:46.600
I know you’re scared, okay?

24:46.600 --> 24:49.730
I know I’m asking a lot of him.

24:49.730 --> 24:50.600
But you have to know

24:50.600 --> 24:54.810
that I would never let
anything happen to Hanni.

24:54.810 --> 24:56.480
I promise.

24:56.900 --> 24:58.400
Think about it.

24:58.400 --> 25:02.230
You guys would love California.

25:06.810 --> 25:09.020
MURTAUGH:Look at them.

25:09.020 --> 25:11.480
These are your victims, Dan.

25:11.480 --> 25:13.650
This guy was a district attorney

25:13.650 --> 25:16.770
that you murdered in cold blood
last Thursday night.
No, no.

25:16.770 --> 25:21.150
I wasn’t even in town
Thursday night, I swear.

25:21.150 --> 25:23.150
Hey.
Hey.

25:23.150 --> 25:24.770
What are you doing here?

25:24.770 --> 25:27.350
Just putting this case to bed.

25:27.350 --> 25:30.270
I mean, it was already in bed,
but it got up.

25:30.270 --> 25:33.520
Had a bad dream.
Now it’s back.

25:33.520 --> 25:34.400
Closed. Shut.

25:34.400 --> 25:37.150
Cool. That’s what I
thought you were doing.

25:37.150 --> 25:37.940
I mean,

25:37.940 --> 25:41.100
we had him on multiple murders.

25:41.100 --> 25:42.520
DNA evidence. Eyewitnesses.

25:42.520 --> 25:45.150
The jury took
all but a half hour to convict.

25:45.150 --> 25:49.520
I mean, so if there’s anything
to this alibi claim

25:49.520 --> 25:53.480
that Trish keeps talking about,
then it would’ve came up.

25:53.480 --> 25:55.440
We followed every lead.

25:55.440 --> 25:57.310
I know we did.

25:57.310 --> 25:58.190
I think we did.

25:58.190 --> 26:00.650
Did we? Did...
What do you think?

26:00.650 --> 26:03.350
Roger, you’re a
great detective.

26:03.350 --> 26:04.230
Question I’d be asking

26:04.230 --> 26:07.480
is why are you torturing
yourself over this one?

26:08.850 --> 26:11.350
What if I was wrong?

26:11.350 --> 26:14.400
What if I made a mistake?

26:14.980 --> 26:16.270
What kind?

26:16.270 --> 26:18.020
’Cause there’s only two.

26:18.020 --> 26:20.770
Mistakes you have to live with

26:20.770 --> 26:22.350
and mistakes you can fix.

26:22.350 --> 26:27.480
If it’s one of those, consider
yourself lucky and fix it.

26:29.770 --> 26:32.690
That’s a good plan.

26:35.650 --> 26:37.150
ROGER JR.:Hey, Mom.

26:37.150 --> 26:38.400
Tangy

26:38.400 --> 26:40.100

26:42.020 --> 26:43.600
♪ You don’t want to come... ♪

26:43.600 --> 26:44.480
It’s good, right?

26:44.480 --> 26:47.520
Very good. Thank you, baby.
Okay, good.

26:48.190 --> 26:51.440
You’re excited
about this, aren’t you?
Yeah.

26:51.440 --> 26:55.440
Anything you want?
Anything you need?

26:55.440 --> 26:59.520
Um... Dad’s support
would be great.

26:59.520 --> 27:01.770
I will see what I can do.

27:01.770 --> 27:04.150
Okay? Yeah.
LEO:
Ding-dong.Shabbat shalom.

27:04.150 --> 27:05.270
In the kitchen!

27:05.270 --> 27:08.440
I brought
some muffin refreshment

27:08.440 --> 27:10.440
for my cocounsel.

27:10.440 --> 27:14.560
We are not cocounsel.
Yes, we are.

27:14.560 --> 27:15.020
The dream team.

27:15.020 --> 27:17.190
I’m the face,
you’re the brains.
Hmm.

27:17.190 --> 27:18.270
What is that amazing smell?

27:18.270 --> 27:20.270
It’s, um...
Wait, wait.

27:20.270 --> 27:22.060
Don’t tell me.

27:22.060 --> 27:24.850
I get hints of...

27:24.850 --> 27:26.270
asparagus
No.

27:26.270 --> 27:29.270
And a whisper of...
Don’t.

27:29.270 --> 27:30.600
A whisper of sausage.

27:30.600 --> 27:32.060
ROGER JR.: It’s
floral undertones.

27:32.060 --> 27:34.060
Oh. Well...
Try that.

27:34.060 --> 27:37.060
Tell me what you think.

27:37.350 --> 27:38.440
Oh, so hot!

27:38.440 --> 27:39.190
It’s very good, though.

27:39.190 --> 27:40.690
ROGER JR.: You
should tell my dad.
I will do that.

27:40.690 --> 27:42.520
Come on.
That is a life-changing
cup of joe.

27:42.520 --> 27:44.520
RJ.
This is what I’m trying to do.

27:44.520 --> 27:46.100
Excuse us for a second.
LEO:
Oh.

27:46.100 --> 27:47.850
Okay. Want to see
something I learned

27:47.850 --> 27:49.400
in the French part of Canada?

27:49.400 --> 27:52.480
Bonjour. Okay, so, innocent?

27:52.480 --> 27:54.770
Don’t tell me.

27:54.770 --> 27:57.730
Tell me. Don’t tell me.

27:59.060 --> 28:00.310
Tell me.
Okay, Leo.

28:00.310 --> 28:02.600
Mm-hmm.
After poring over the files,

28:02.600 --> 28:05.560
there are some
glaring mistakes.
Mm-hmm.

28:05.560 --> 28:06.900
Like the alibi.
Yes.

28:06.900 --> 28:09.230
Okay. Visiting his
sister in Arizona?

28:09.230 --> 28:11.310
She’s dead.
I can’t prove it.

28:11.310 --> 28:14.230
What about the witness
to the McGregor crime scene?
Okay.

28:14.230 --> 28:16.350
He was a vagrant.
Nobody could find him.

28:16.350 --> 28:19.020
But I got a pretty good episode
out of it

28:19.020 --> 28:22.520
because he said he saw somebody
put on giant shoes

28:22.520 --> 28:25.980
like a clown and go
traipsing through the blood

28:25.980 --> 28:27.810
and then take off in a North
Valley Sanitation truck.

28:27.810 --> 28:32.350
I called that one
"Red Nose, Red Herring."

28:32.350 --> 28:35.100
Dan Harrison wears
a size 15 shoe.

28:35.100 --> 28:38.270
Well, why would somebody
put on Dan’s shoes unless...

28:38.270 --> 28:40.560
They were trying to frame him.

28:41.690 --> 28:45.400
I think I’m having indigestion.

28:47.770 --> 28:48.440
AVERY:
Roger.

28:48.440 --> 28:51.100
What is so big you needed
to call me in on a Saturday?

28:51.100 --> 28:53.690
I think I need to recuse myself
from this case.

28:53.690 --> 28:54.400
What are you talking about?

28:54.400 --> 28:57.980
I spent the night
looking over Harrison’s alibi

28:57.980 --> 28:59.020
for the McGregor murder.
And?

28:59.020 --> 29:02.480
I got a record
from a-a car rental company.

29:02.480 --> 29:03.980
It appears
that he was in Arizona

29:03.980 --> 29:06.690
on the night of the murder.

29:07.440 --> 29:09.270
Or at least his license was.

29:09.270 --> 29:12.060
Okay, so we reopen the case.

29:12.060 --> 29:13.400
I messed up.

29:13.400 --> 29:16.350
I mean, I’ll face
whatever disciplinary action

29:16.350 --> 29:17.850
is appropriate.

29:17.850 --> 29:18.600
I mean, that’s only right.

29:18.600 --> 29:20.810
What’s right
is having my best detective

29:20.810 --> 29:21.270
working this case.

29:21.270 --> 29:24.020
I don’t think Turner’s
gonna feel the same way.

29:24.020 --> 29:27.230
You go tell the ADA you have
my full and unwavering support.

29:27.230 --> 29:30.850
Narrowed down the McGregor
murders to two main suspects.

29:30.850 --> 29:31.810
How do you have
suspects already?

29:31.810 --> 29:34.190
Well, I was thinking that if
Harrison didn’t kill McGregor,

29:34.190 --> 29:36.310
then maybe it was somebody
he was prosecuting at the time.

29:36.310 --> 29:39.980
That’s a good idea.
You have any leads?

29:39.980 --> 29:41.020
Yeah.

29:41.020 --> 29:42.150
The Orasco brothers

29:42.150 --> 29:43.810
were facing
racketeering charges,

29:43.810 --> 29:47.600
and the Van Nuys
exotic pet smuggling ring.

29:47.600 --> 29:48.600
Ooh.

29:48.600 --> 29:49.560
Was there a zebra?

29:49.560 --> 29:51.440
What about weasels?

29:51.440 --> 29:52.310
Gentlemen.

29:52.310 --> 29:54.100
Rog. Cappy. Magic Mike.

29:54.100 --> 29:55.600
I’ll sit.
Okay, Roger.

29:55.600 --> 29:58.100
I am sorry. I know you
don’t want to hear this,

29:58.100 --> 30:00.020
but we have a lead.

30:00.020 --> 30:01.900
And I might have

30:01.900 --> 30:02.690
an innocent client.

30:02.690 --> 30:05.520
I know.
I never wanted this for us.

30:05.520 --> 30:06.400
A vagrant

30:06.400 --> 30:07.560
in the McGregor murder

30:07.560 --> 30:08.850
says he saw someone tamper

30:08.850 --> 30:10.190
with the crime scene
and take off

30:10.190 --> 30:12.020
in a North Valley Sanitation
truck.

30:12.020 --> 30:13.150
North Valley.
TRISH:
Mm-hmm.

30:13.150 --> 30:15.150
That’s the Orasco Brothers’
company.

30:15.150 --> 30:16.600
Well, bring them in.

30:16.600 --> 30:18.560
Come with me.
And I’ll talk to Turner.

30:18.560 --> 30:20.440
What do I do?
I

30:20.440 --> 30:23.480
You file an appeal,
Leo. Let’s go.

30:23.480 --> 30:25.810
Hey.
Yeah.

30:25.810 --> 30:28.350
I made a mistake.

30:28.350 --> 30:30.310
Thanks for pushing me.

30:30.520 --> 30:31.400
I’ll always push you.

30:31.400 --> 30:35.560
That’s when you know
I have your back, hmm?

30:42.520 --> 30:45.100
AVERY: LAPD. Hands in the air.
Against the wall.

30:45.100 --> 30:46.850
Everybody up.

30:50.520 --> 30:54.900
Let’s clean them out.
Hold on. Leave him.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.560
AVERY:
What you got?

31:03.560 --> 31:05.900
Unclear.

31:16.560 --> 31:17.350
Cole?

31:17.350 --> 31:21.020
Just as I suspected.

31:22.980 --> 31:23.980
Jelly doughnut.

31:23.980 --> 31:25.810
J... Jelly doughnut?

31:25.810 --> 31:27.520
Or cream-filled.

31:28.770 --> 31:29.850
You were eating it

31:29.850 --> 31:31.940
before we got here.

31:31.940 --> 31:32.900
Then you realized,

31:32.900 --> 31:36.060
"Oh, boy. It’s the coppers.

31:36.060 --> 31:39.900
I got to hide some stuff fast."

31:44.980 --> 31:46.230
Huh.

31:46.230 --> 31:46.900
Why don’t you open that up

31:46.900 --> 31:50.480
and show us where you stashed
the rest of the doughnuts?

31:52.230 --> 31:55.060
MURTAUGH:I appreciate
you coming in on a weekend.

31:55.060 --> 31:56.270
But it’s important.

31:56.270 --> 31:58.020
No problem.
What’s your big news?

31:58.020 --> 32:01.770
I was wrong about Dan Harrison.
He didn’t commit the murders.

32:01.770 --> 32:04.400
Killer’s still out there.

32:04.400 --> 32:06.560
Come on. That’s ridiculous.

32:06.560 --> 32:09.020
This case is closed.
I’m afraid not.

32:09.020 --> 32:09.520
There’s evidence

32:09.520 --> 32:12.810
that Harrison had an alibi
for the McGregor murder.

32:12.810 --> 32:16.440
So, you know, we have to look
into other suspects.

32:16.440 --> 32:17.600
I’m sorry.
I screwed up.

32:17.600 --> 32:21.310
You know, Murtaugh, I was afraid
you were gonna say this.

32:21.560 --> 32:24.310
You know what I think
your problem is?

32:24.310 --> 32:27.480
You’re just too good a cop.

32:27.480 --> 32:32.980
Detective Murtaugh,
meet the Orasco brothers.

32:36.600 --> 32:37.520
AVERY:Anything good in there?

32:37.520 --> 32:38.690
Well, these guys
were into all kinds

32:38.690 --> 32:41.190
of illegal activity--
extortion, bribery.

32:41.190 --> 32:42.310
I mean, this ledger
shows payments

32:42.310 --> 32:43.810
to some high-up
government officials.

32:43.810 --> 32:47.400
Everything just went away
with McGregor’s death?

32:48.650 --> 32:49.900
Unless... Wait.

32:49.900 --> 32:52.150
Mike Turner’s in here.
He took over the case

32:52.150 --> 32:54.230
from McGregor
and dropped all the charges.

32:54.230 --> 32:55.690
Murtaugh’s with him right now.

32:55.690 --> 32:56.560
Move! Let’s move.

32:56.560 --> 32:59.480
MURTAUGH:So you killed all those people,

32:59.480 --> 33:00.900
and framed Dan Harrison, and

33:00.900 --> 33:03.310
I put away an innocent
man for ten years?

33:03.310 --> 33:04.600
Oh, Harrison was
a real-deal psycho.

33:04.600 --> 33:06.850
He killed three people,
probably would’ve killed more.

33:06.850 --> 33:09.270
So you just tacked on
McGregor’s murder,

33:09.270 --> 33:11.900
made it look like one
of Harrison’s victims?

33:11.900 --> 33:14.400
Turner’s idea.
Worked, too.

33:19.020 --> 33:20.940
So you just
shoot me, huh?

33:20.940 --> 33:21.770
Nah. You’re beloved.

33:21.770 --> 33:23.690
LAPD won’t rest until
they find the killer.

33:23.690 --> 33:25.690
Ah, it’s much easier
if you off yourself.

33:25.690 --> 33:27.020
Nobody’s gonna buy that.
No?

33:27.020 --> 33:29.770
Depressed cop who couldn’t
hack it as captain,

33:29.770 --> 33:32.560
scorned by a public
that thought he was corrupt

33:32.560 --> 33:34.850
and responsible
for framing a man.

33:34.850 --> 33:37.810
You jump off the
courthouse rooftop?

33:37.810 --> 33:39.850
There’s a kind
of symmetry to it.

33:39.850 --> 33:41.940
You want to do the honors,
Murtaugh?

33:41.940 --> 33:42.900
Why don’t you come get me?

33:42.900 --> 33:44.730
Oh. That’s why
I have these guys.

33:44.730 --> 33:46.770
Don’t get my hands messy.

33:50.100 --> 33:52.940
LAPD! Hands
in the air!

34:00.020 --> 34:01.520
Oh!

34:03.770 --> 34:06.270
Cover me! Rog, hold on!

34:07.850 --> 34:09.770
Grab the rope!

34:16.060 --> 34:19.810
(Murtaugh yells,
rope squeaks)

34:21.600 --> 34:24.600
Hold on, Rog! I got you!

34:24.600 --> 34:27.020
Oh! Oh. Oh.

34:33.480 --> 34:37.810
I need Fire and Rescue on the
west side of the building now!

34:42.060 --> 34:45.310
I can’t hold on!

34:45.940 --> 34:48.150
I’m gonna get you through this.

34:48.150 --> 34:49.690
Just talk to me.

34:49.690 --> 34:50.480
About what?!

34:50.480 --> 34:52.600
I don’t know. Anything.

34:52.600 --> 34:55.190
Where would you rather be
than here?

34:55.190 --> 34:56.020
I don’t know. Home?!

34:56.020 --> 34:58.690
That’s not very exotic.
Well, forgive me

34:58.690 --> 35:00.020
for not being so exciting.

35:00.020 --> 35:01.270
I think I’m gonna die!

35:01.270 --> 35:03.810
All the more reason
for you fantasize.

35:10.650 --> 35:11.770
You ever been to Borneo?

35:11.770 --> 35:12.520
No. Where’s that?

35:12.520 --> 35:15.940
Just a hop, skip
and jump from the Philippines.

35:15.940 --> 35:16.810
Rainforests.

35:16.810 --> 35:21.650
The most beautiful beaches
you’ve ever seen.

35:21.650 --> 35:24.400
Sparkling blue water.

35:24.400 --> 35:26.100
We should go.

35:26.100 --> 35:29.020
Yeah. Sure, whatever.

35:40.980 --> 35:43.100
Turner, hands in the air!

35:43.690 --> 35:44.900
Okay, don’t shoot!

35:44.900 --> 35:47.400
FIREMAN:
Let’s move!
Go! Go! Go!

35:47.400 --> 35:48.270
(rope creaking,
groans, mumbles)

35:48.270 --> 35:52.850
Cole, let go, or we’re
both gonna go over!

35:52.850 --> 35:54.650
Sorry, Roger.

35:54.650 --> 35:56.400
I made a commitment to take you

35:56.400 --> 35:57.980
to Borneo...

35:57.980 --> 35:59.560
...and I intend to keep it.

35:59.560 --> 36:01.730
(Murtaugh yells,
Cole grunts)

36:06.900 --> 36:09.060
Let’s go!
Come on!

36:09.400 --> 36:10.770
Move it!
Yeah, set it up!

36:18.190 --> 36:20.100
I’m never
leaving my house again.

36:20.100 --> 36:23.310
Hey, guys, can I
try that again?
No.

36:24.060 --> 36:26.810
MURTAUGH:
Leo, not everything belongs
on a podcast.

36:26.810 --> 36:28.020
I almost died.

36:28.020 --> 36:29.900
Come on,
just-just one interview

36:29.900 --> 36:32.980
to seal your legacy
as the hero

36:32.980 --> 36:35.230
of this macabre tale.

36:35.230 --> 36:38.730
Leo, I just did my job.

36:39.060 --> 36:40.690
And there you have it.

36:40.690 --> 36:43.270
He just... did...
his job,

36:43.270 --> 36:44.270
the same way
that we did

36:44.270 --> 36:46.310
our job, clearing a man
of one of the four

36:46.310 --> 36:48.650
of the murders
of which he had been accused.

36:48.650 --> 36:50.690
And there he is.
Oh, hey, Magic Mike.

36:50.690 --> 36:52.730
Hey, Cole, Cole, I hear

36:52.730 --> 36:55.150
that you are ex-CIA.

36:55.150 --> 36:57.560
You must have a lot of
stories to tell, huh?

36:57.560 --> 36:59.900
Hard pass.
Oh, come on!

36:59.900 --> 37:01.650
Let me tell your story.

37:01.650 --> 37:04.020
The world needs a
good guy to root for.

37:04.020 --> 37:07.400
How do you know
I’m not a bad guy?

37:13.190 --> 37:15.060
MURTAUGH:
So you think

37:15.060 --> 37:16.770
you’re one of the bad guys, huh?

37:16.770 --> 37:21.650
No, I just didn’t want
to star in his podcast.

37:22.150 --> 37:25.440
Yeah. You want to get
those checked out, huh?

37:25.440 --> 37:27.650
No, I already did.
It’s... not a big deal.

37:27.650 --> 37:30.150
It’s just a little rope burn.
Thank you.

37:30.150 --> 37:32.190
Chips?

37:32.190 --> 37:33.650
Yes, please.

37:33.650 --> 37:35.730
Why-why don’t you
let me, uh...?

37:35.730 --> 37:38.560
Yeah. Do you mind?
Yeah.

37:40.650 --> 37:43.690
So, are we gonna
do this thing or what?

37:43.690 --> 37:44.480
Hmm?

37:44.480 --> 37:46.560
Borneo.
There’s a red-eye tonight.

37:46.560 --> 37:48.350
We can be there in two days.

37:48.350 --> 37:50.690
You’re wrong.

37:50.690 --> 37:51.600
No, I’m not.

37:51.600 --> 37:53.690
I’ve been there
a bunch of times.

37:53.690 --> 37:55.270
We can even use miles.

37:55.270 --> 37:56.520
Not that.

37:56.520 --> 37:58.440
You’re one of the
good guys, Cole,

37:58.440 --> 38:02.310
whether you want to
believe it or not.

38:19.230 --> 38:23.940
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
let me help you out.

38:25.520 --> 38:26.440
Whew!

38:26.440 --> 38:28.230
So I guess this is it.

38:28.230 --> 38:28.730
Mom told me

38:28.730 --> 38:31.940
she’s gonna take me
to the airport, so...

38:32.650 --> 38:33.980
Hey, listen, man,

38:33.980 --> 38:37.060
you know I don’t like
to admit stuff like this,

38:37.060 --> 38:38.520
but you were right.

38:38.520 --> 38:41.440
I’ve had my share of mistakes.

38:41.440 --> 38:42.230
You? No.

38:42.230 --> 38:45.810
I’m still not convinced about
this whole Costa Rica thing.

38:45.810 --> 38:47.730
It feels a bit impulsive to me.

38:47.730 --> 38:49.560
I mean, where...
where are you gonna eat?

38:49.560 --> 38:50.310
Hmm

38:50.310 --> 38:53.230
Well, I’m gonna stay on a farm
with some of my friends, and

38:53.230 --> 38:57.810
I don’t know what I’m gonna eat,
but I promise, I won’t starve.

39:02.440 --> 39:04.480
Did you just slip
me some cash?

39:04.480 --> 39:05.560
Yeah, some walk-around money.

39:05.560 --> 39:09.150
Maybe get yourself
a meal off the farm.

39:09.150 --> 39:11.480
Thanks, Dad.

39:11.480 --> 39:13.400
And call. A lot.

39:13.400 --> 39:16.100
Not text message, you know?

39:16.100 --> 39:18.520
Like real verbal communication.

39:18.520 --> 39:21.940
You got it? Okay.
Got it.

39:22.100 --> 39:26.650
And, um, about what
I said the other day...

39:26.900 --> 39:31.020
It’s just you al... you always
know what you wanted to do,

39:31.020 --> 39:34.190
and I-I don’t, so...

39:34.190 --> 39:37.230
I got to go look for it.

39:43.810 --> 39:44.560
Come on, Ma.

39:44.560 --> 39:46.560
No, you promised
you wouldn’t cry.

39:46.560 --> 39:48.060
And I’m not.

39:50.600 --> 39:53.850
All right, take these
to the car, okay?
All right.

39:53.850 --> 39:57.480
You need help?
I got it.

39:57.480 --> 39:59.600
I love you.

40:01.440 --> 40:02.900
I’m proud of him.

40:02.900 --> 40:05.350
He should see more
of the world than me.

40:05.350 --> 40:09.190
Baby, you’re an L.A.
police detective.

40:09.190 --> 40:13.440
You see more in one day than
most people do in a lifetime.

40:16.980 --> 40:20.230
Mom, Dad,
I don’t think I can go.

40:21.060 --> 40:24.480
Uh...
Okay. Well, you know,
just stay here.

40:24.480 --> 40:27.350
I mean, there’s plenty of coffee
right here in Los Angeles.

40:27.350 --> 40:28.980
Mm-hmm. Mm.
No, that’s not it.

40:28.980 --> 40:30.650
Passport expired last week.

40:30.650 --> 40:32.400
TRISH:
What?

40:32.400 --> 40:35.020
Yup. Last week.

40:35.020 --> 40:36.900
Hmm.

40:37.480 --> 40:40.400
No, I... No, I-I get it.
I get it.

40:40.400 --> 40:41.310
No. No, I feel you judging.

40:41.310 --> 40:42.650
I get it.
No, I made...
We abs...

40:42.650 --> 40:45.190
We didn’t say anything.
I made a mistake!
