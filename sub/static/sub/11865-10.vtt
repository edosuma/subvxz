01:07.541 --> 01:08.783
When I was a kid,

01:08.834 --> 01:11.902
my parents would tell me to
hold on to things tightly--

01:12.018 --> 01:14.426
a kite, a
balloon, whatever--

01:14.802 --> 01:16.157
to not let go...

01:16.752 --> 01:19.854
but I was scared that
if I held on too tightly

01:20.097 --> 01:22.497
to something or to someone,

01:22.945 --> 01:24.734
I'd be carried away.

01:26.112 --> 01:28.759
Except I'm the one always
telling people it's over,

01:28.826 --> 01:29.921
time to move on.

01:30.336 --> 01:32.271
That's what grim reapers do.

01:33.821 --> 01:38.308
And now I'm crouching in the bushes
outside a bullshit country club,

01:38.352 --> 01:41.035
hoping to get a look at
the boy I can't let go of.

01:41.368 --> 01:42.382
What the fuck?

01:43.466 --> 01:44.520
He disappeared.

01:44.899 --> 01:45.866
He didn't call.

01:46.286 --> 01:47.664
It was my first time.

01:48.605 --> 01:49.856
What an asshole.

01:50.148 --> 01:53.588
Really, all I wanted to do was
tell somebody what had happened,

01:53.643 --> 01:55.318
tell them what I had become.

01:55.501 --> 01:56.569
I'm a stalker.

01:57.044 --> 01:58.448
I had a stalker once.

01:58.551 --> 01:59.861
Yeah, he was a sweet boy.

01:59.928 --> 02:01.301
He'd leave me
wildflowers--

02:01.445 --> 02:03.731
dead wildflowers and little sparrows.

02:03.820 --> 02:06.159
Doesn't anyone want to
know why I'm a stalker?

02:06.200 --> 02:08.818
- How'd you get rid of him?
- I stabbed him with garden shears.

02:08.878 --> 02:09.673
Did you kill him?

02:09.729 --> 02:11.552
No, I stabbed him right here.

02:11.634 --> 02:14.947
Whoo. I would have stalked you,
Daisy. I would have stalked you.

02:15.045 --> 02:16.463
What is it that you're doing now?

02:16.523 --> 02:19.704
Please, come on. I'm not
stalking you. I'm persistent.

02:19.761 --> 02:22.273
Well, I'm stalking someone
now. Who wants to guess why?

02:22.346 --> 02:23.386
What would you like, sweetie?

02:23.999 --> 02:24.814
Revenge.

02:24.898 --> 02:26.566
We're out of that.
Anything else look good?

02:26.617 --> 02:27.824
Oatmeal with raisins.

02:29.511 --> 02:31.082
Why are you stalking somebody?

02:31.144 --> 02:33.351
Why would you be stalking anyone at all?

02:33.406 --> 02:34.754
Oh, shit, it's Johnny Law.

02:34.801 --> 02:38.608
I'm not exactly stalking anyone. I'm...

02:38.702 --> 02:39.408
You're what?

02:39.520 --> 02:40.288
I'm just...

02:40.437 --> 02:41.113
Spit it out.

02:42.276 --> 02:44.380
- I'm having oatmeal.
- With raisins.

02:44.600 --> 02:46.879
Well. I'm glad we got that settled.

02:47.136 --> 02:49.500
How did that thing with that
Trip bloke work out, George?

02:49.578 --> 02:51.656
We slept together, and
then he blew me off.

02:51.729 --> 02:52.661
Not my type.

02:52.764 --> 02:53.920
Yeah, he's alive.

02:56.468 --> 02:57.867
Is that Rube's datebook?

02:57.934 --> 03:00.439
Why have you got his books?
Are you carrying them now, Roxy?

03:00.491 --> 03:02.783
Can't believe this. Does he
let you clean his erasers?

03:02.898 --> 03:03.931
Rube isn't here.

03:04.406 --> 03:06.280
And you're substitute teacher?

03:06.399 --> 03:09.863
He can't just leave and
not tell me. Fucking men.

03:09.954 --> 03:11.937
Calm down. He'll be back.

03:11.975 --> 03:13.194
I don't think you should get to be Rube.

03:13.270 --> 03:14.500
I think I should get to be Rube.

03:14.551 --> 03:18.463
Mason, I will shoot you where
you better pray it grows back.

03:20.995 --> 03:22.160
There you go, Roxy.

03:24.378 --> 03:25.893
Here are your reap reports.

03:26.464 --> 03:29.416
Just a brief description
of what happened,

03:29.544 --> 03:30.737
how the person died,

03:30.808 --> 03:32.156
and how the reap went down.

03:32.213 --> 03:33.784
Fill it out. Turn it back in.

03:33.866 --> 03:36.012
Yeah, I don't do paperwork.

03:36.433 --> 03:38.869
- You can't write?
- I can write fine.

03:38.924 --> 03:41.373
Oh, well, you're an actress,
so I didn't want to assume.

03:41.424 --> 03:44.830
- Seriously, where is Rube?
- Personal business, peanut.

03:44.871 --> 03:46.029
Don't call me that.

03:46.269 --> 03:49.321
He can't just not call and disappear.

03:51.087 --> 03:51.962
Here's your oatmeal.

03:52.190 --> 03:53.694
I don't need oatmeal...

03:54.164 --> 03:55.286
or raisins,

03:55.752 --> 03:57.000
or anybody.

04:04.083 --> 04:06.376
You two got anything you want to say?

04:07.536 --> 04:08.291
Me.

04:09.266 --> 04:10.571
I didn't get a post-it.

04:10.735 --> 04:12.600
That's because you're
going to help George.

04:12.651 --> 04:13.700
You two do the reap,

04:13.960 --> 04:15.144
you fill out the form,

04:15.283 --> 04:17.423
and then you come back
to me for debriefing.

04:18.394 --> 04:20.613
You got some thing you
want to say, blondie?

04:20.678 --> 04:23.818
No, but those dress blues do
wonderful things for your eyes, Roxy.

04:23.880 --> 04:26.675
I just... love a woman in a uniform.

04:27.082 --> 04:28.212
What you trying to say?

04:28.426 --> 04:30.661
I'm just a sucker for authority figures.

04:32.689 --> 04:35.406
You two got secrets?
I don't like secrets.

04:35.707 --> 04:36.829
I don't have secrets.

04:38.346 --> 04:39.518
I have no secrets.

04:39.747 --> 04:40.568
Okay.

04:41.520 --> 04:42.413
Where's Rube?

04:44.049 --> 04:45.397
He has secrets.

05:04.675 --> 05:05.900
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:06.135 --> 05:07.349
- You need some help?
- I do.

05:07.528 --> 05:08.680
Got to take a number, dude.

05:12.994 --> 05:14.605
Well, who got the first one?

05:14.896 --> 05:16.540
I don't know. I wasn't here on friday.

05:19.741 --> 05:23.099
Well, I need information about a
woman who lived here a while back.

05:24.216 --> 05:27.832
Marriage licenses,
deeds, death certificates,

05:27.893 --> 05:29.357
that sort of thing.

05:29.458 --> 05:30.140
Sorry, man.

05:30.842 --> 05:33.485
Mrs.  Jacobs does records.
I'm vehicle registration.

05:34.389 --> 05:37.007
She's not here, so you got to come back.

05:37.151 --> 05:38.655
Wednesday is records.

05:38.738 --> 05:40.002
What's your name, son?

05:40.643 --> 05:41.407
J oey.

05:41.499 --> 05:43.726
You know what people say
about kids these days, Joey.

05:44.411 --> 05:47.623
Ah, they say you're all a bunch
of self-obsessed, lazy numbnuts

05:47.673 --> 05:50.404
who have lost the capacity
to think for themselves.

05:50.823 --> 05:51.975
Well, it's not true.

05:52.963 --> 05:54.490
Oh, I'll kick their asses for saying so.

05:54.724 --> 05:55.856
Good for you, Joey.

05:57.191 --> 05:58.129
Here's my number.

06:00.045 --> 06:03.803
Now how about restoring a dude's faith
in America's youth and helping me out?

06:04.372 --> 06:06.261
Anything for America, dude.

06:07.318 --> 06:09.339
You're a good kid and
fine citizen, Joey.

06:09.990 --> 06:10.860
Knock yourself out.

06:10.947 --> 06:13.107
Uh, just don't tell mrs. Jacobs, because

06:13.173 --> 06:14.126
she will fuck me up.

06:14.198 --> 06:15.934
Oh, that's not a
problem. Where do we go?

06:16.773 --> 06:18.295
Well, this is, like, it.

06:18.981 --> 06:20.159
We went digital last year.

06:35.738 --> 06:37.179
Oh, sorry about that.

06:40.306 --> 06:42.053
Listen, sweetie.
Tonight's with your dad,

06:42.110 --> 06:43.879
so you're going to need
to pack your overnight.

06:44.431 --> 06:45.327
I'm packed.

06:45.696 --> 06:48.178
Neatly, or did you just
throw everything in there?

06:48.716 --> 06:49.506
Neatly.

06:50.841 --> 06:53.291
Langenstein's is delivering
over some groceries,

06:53.479 --> 06:57.079
so please, try to be nice.

06:57.161 --> 06:58.875
Why are we getting groceries delivered?

06:59.021 --> 07:00.960
Well, because it makes my life easier.

07:01.805 --> 07:04.493
Gail recommended him.
Everyone's using him.

07:07.242 --> 07:09.122
Hello. Oh, my god.

07:09.259 --> 07:10.139
Joy lass?

07:10.750 --> 07:11.442
Yes.

07:11.650 --> 07:13.265
I'm Vince from Langenstein's.

07:13.401 --> 07:15.194
Guaranteed to bring
it on time, every time.

07:19.508 --> 07:21.601
- Hey, little lady.
- Hi.

07:23.988 --> 07:27.367
- So that'll be 73 on the nose.
- Oh, right. Okay.

07:28.363 --> 07:33.675
Um... oh, god. I forgot
to go to the f-ing A.T.M.

07:33.829 --> 07:35.704
- Mom. - I
said "f"-ing.

07:36.141 --> 07:38.409
Um, you know what? I have
some more money upstairs,

07:38.463 --> 07:40.075
so I'll just run and get it.

07:46.769 --> 07:48.043
You like pop tarts?

07:48.951 --> 07:50.639
- Yep.
- Yeah, me too.

07:55.013 --> 07:56.243
What's your name?

07:57.000 --> 07:57.988
Reggie.

07:58.544 --> 07:59.381
You married?

08:00.681 --> 08:03.057
Well, I bet the boys at
school have big crushes on you.

08:03.263 --> 08:05.111
Just one, but he's a geek.

08:05.194 --> 08:06.464
I remember when I was your age,

08:06.827 --> 08:08.465
I used to totally be afraid of girls.

08:08.951 --> 08:10.349
Now I'm not afraid of anythinng.

08:10.825 --> 08:13.760
- Everyone's afraid of something.
- Not me.

08:14.623 --> 08:18.450
- My sister's dead.
- Okay.

08:18.647 --> 08:21.846
You can ask my mom if you don't
believe me. She died last year.

08:22.926 --> 08:26.131
- How did she die?
- She was murdered.

08:26.214 --> 08:29.111
- Seriously?
- In the living room.

08:29.735 --> 08:31.472
They never found who did it.

08:32.226 --> 08:34.985
Okay... here we go.

08:35.942 --> 08:40.028
72, and it's a miracle, five more.

08:40.383 --> 08:41.207
Thanks.

08:41.323 --> 08:43.577
Boy, this was so easy.

08:43.717 --> 08:46.383
I guess we'll be seeing
you next week, hmm, Reggie?

08:47.374 --> 08:48.974
Actually, this is not my route.

08:49.081 --> 08:51.232
I'm filling in for
Davey. You'll like him.

08:52.269 --> 08:55.047
- Oh, okay.
- Bye.

09:02.222 --> 09:04.484
There's never a cop
around when you need one.

09:05.463 --> 09:06.917
And by the same logic,

09:06.972 --> 09:10.266
when a girl finally  has one
secret truly worth sharing,

09:10.817 --> 09:14.039
there's never a single
person around to listen.

09:15.903 --> 09:17.461
God! Get a room.

09:20.294 --> 09:21.122
Yuck.

09:23.180 --> 09:25.202
- What's up, Crystal?
- Nothing.

09:25.744 --> 09:27.752
It's like mating season around here.

09:27.882 --> 09:30.732
Are we, like, the only two
in this office who are single?

09:31.595 --> 09:34.687
I mean, I don't mean to assume.

09:34.804 --> 09:37.564
Do you have a boyfriend, Crystal?

09:45.977 --> 09:48.143
Okay. Nice talking to you.

09:48.554 --> 09:49.459
You too.

09:49.744 --> 09:51.200
I couldn't tell Delores.

09:51.596 --> 09:53.464
That would be like telling a parent,

09:53.673 --> 09:56.510
and there are some lines
you just don't cross.

09:57.734 --> 09:59.279
I have to tell you something.

09:59.377 --> 10:00.068
Let  me guess.

10:00.401 --> 10:02.757
You have a doctor's appointment
and have to leave early again.

10:02.824 --> 10:03.382
No.

10:03.556 --> 10:06.076
Millie, this is really getting
to be a pain in the keister.

10:06.142 --> 10:08.882
No, what I was
going to tell you--

10:10.895 --> 10:13.324
Do you ever get the
feeling that we're, like,

10:13.385 --> 10:15.743
the only two people
here that are single?

10:16.042 --> 10:19.532
Millie, you say that
as if it's a bad thing.

10:19.764 --> 10:22.693
I have an active online profile,

10:22.759 --> 10:26.040
and not a day goes by that I don't
receive an e-mail about you know what.

10:26.097 --> 10:26.942
Don't ask.

10:27.044 --> 10:27.612
What?

10:27.680 --> 10:28.484
You know.

10:28.973 --> 10:30.353
No, I don't know.

10:30.445 --> 10:32.442
Men want one thing, millie.

10:34.121 --> 10:36.694
I've just received an e-mail
of a sexually explicit nature.

10:36.750 --> 10:37.710
Don't look.

10:37.816 --> 10:38.705
Really?

10:42.334 --> 10:45.647
Oh, he wants to meet
Murray. That's sweet.

10:45.781 --> 10:48.392
That's not sweet,
Millie. It's provocative.

10:48.446 --> 10:49.350
I don't get it.

10:49.417 --> 10:50.707
Oh, come on.

10:50.871 --> 10:53.656
He wants to... pet my cat.

10:55.779 --> 10:58.470
Maybe he just wants to meet Murray.

10:59.163 --> 11:01.787
My goodness, you are young.

11:02.129 --> 11:06.157
Anyway, I'm meeting a new e-friend
this evening at the ren fair,

11:06.248 --> 11:10.201
and  maybe you think watching jousting
all night doesn't mean anything.

11:10.258 --> 11:13.531
I'm telling you, men have one thing
and one thing only on the brain.

11:13.703 --> 11:14.524
Jousting?

11:14.620 --> 11:16.685
They're primal creatures,

11:16.751 --> 11:18.951
these--
these men.

11:19.040 --> 11:20.714
They're awful, aren't they?

11:20.812 --> 11:22.984
But they're cute, and they can't cook,

11:23.065 --> 11:24.821
and we just can't help ourselves.

11:24.911 --> 11:26.107
I got to go.

11:26.203 --> 11:28.461
Oh, I'm sorry, Millie. You wanted
to tell me something. What was it?

11:28.555 --> 11:30.112
I have a doctor's appointment.

11:34.157 --> 11:37.381
No, that's what time the
pilates class is, Clancy.

11:38.630 --> 11:41.704
I'm getting in shape
for myself, all right?

11:42.246 --> 11:43.931
Look, can you pick her up early or not?

11:45.268 --> 11:46.022
Thank you.

11:48.560 --> 11:49.467
Pilates?

11:50.535 --> 11:51.341
Yeah.

11:51.720 --> 11:53.757
It's an exercise class.

11:53.830 --> 11:54.935
I know what it is.

11:55.144 --> 11:57.541
- Lily Nolan does it.
- She's 11.

11:57.669 --> 12:00.352
- You don't do pilates.
- Okay, you're right. I lied.

12:01.357 --> 12:03.456
- I have a date.
- No way.

12:04.052 --> 12:07.430
Yeah, that's right.
Your mother has a date.

12:07.699 --> 12:11.581
- With Vince?
- The delivery guy? Oh, no.

12:12.409 --> 12:14.609
Does it bother you that I have a date?

12:15.422 --> 12:17.329
Because... you know...

12:19.612 --> 12:24.123
the thing is, honey... I mean,
as much as I love to be alone,

12:24.607 --> 12:27.512
and  as much as I love being your mom,

12:27.718 --> 12:28.890
well, there's
just a part of me--

12:28.962 --> 12:30.380
Dad's girlfriend dumped him.

12:30.447 --> 12:32.290
- Really?
- Dumped him.

12:32.340 --> 12:34.042
- Did he tell you that?
- Yep.

12:35.660 --> 12:37.370
Don't tell your dad about my date.

12:37.836 --> 12:40.847
So if he asks, should I just lie?

12:41.848 --> 12:43.291
Like a rug.

12:46.799 --> 12:48.872
Most people know that death's coming,

12:48.949 --> 12:52.037
and most people refrain
from seeking it out.

12:52.153 --> 12:54.044
Some people are different.

12:54.105 --> 12:58.882
Friendos, we gather today so
that yours truly, Icarus Jones,

12:58.994 --> 13:01.945
can demonstrate that it is
better to take the sick risk

13:02.053 --> 13:06.480
than to suffer that wasting illness
other people call "getting by."

13:09.420 --> 13:13.102
Some people have no comprehension
that death can be so close.

13:13.850 --> 13:15.913
And now I have a little message

13:15.969 --> 13:18.499
for any grim reapers out
there in the audience.

13:18.555 --> 13:22.969
I realize it must be so
frustrating going home empty-handed.

13:23.092 --> 13:27.333
- This is some weird shit.
- True words, georgie. True words.

13:27.399 --> 13:29.948
Seriously. You cannot
mess around with death,

13:30.100 --> 13:31.843
and if death is here today,

13:31.910 --> 13:35.187
then I have something really
personal I want to express to him.

13:35.412 --> 13:36.231
Or her.

13:36.519 --> 13:37.307
Let me see.

13:39.087 --> 13:42.324
Death, you can kiss my sweet ass!

13:44.076 --> 13:46.179
Is that-- is
that for us?

13:46.817 --> 13:48.363
I believe it is.

13:48.619 --> 13:50.093
That's really impolite.

14:04.350 --> 14:05.671
Let's do this shit!

14:19.506 --> 14:20.433
Wake up, man.

14:21.080 --> 14:22.289
We just won the lottery.

14:43.770 --> 14:45.754
Yes. Oh, yes!

14:45.900 --> 14:47.023
That was sick!

14:47.146 --> 14:50.298
50-foot freefall, all vertical. Oww!

14:51.241 --> 14:53.969
You're dead. You
realize that, don't you?

14:54.106 --> 14:55.851
Yeah, it had to happen sooner or later.

14:56.548 --> 14:57.998
Don't you care?

14:58.133 --> 15:03.072
Sure. It's all transition.
What happens next?

15:03.376 --> 15:05.442
No! You don't get it.

15:05.786 --> 15:07.809
You're fucking dead, and you know what?

15:07.871 --> 15:11.152
It doesn't take anything special
to jump off a fucking building.

15:11.214 --> 15:12.413
Whoa, easy...

15:12.522 --> 15:16.335
Don't "whoa, easy" me! You
were alive, and now you're dead.

15:16.417 --> 15:21.507
No more jumping or diving or kissing
or partying or dating or whatever.

15:21.585 --> 15:23.252
What the fuck is your problem?

15:36.851 --> 15:37.713
What's this?

15:38.528 --> 15:39.572
It's national, man.

15:40.110 --> 15:42.205
We're tied in to the
whole national database.

15:42.459 --> 15:44.795
Boom, instant information.

15:45.130 --> 15:47.387
I don't want national.
I want here, this town.

15:48.932 --> 15:52.035
But this is like... more.

15:54.430 --> 15:56.071
I don't envy you, Joey.

15:56.911 --> 16:01.263
You live in a world with 12,000
menus and not a thing you can eat.

16:01.668 --> 16:04.874
Hey, I get that.

16:06.665 --> 16:08.397
I really hope you do.

16:09.144 --> 16:13.199
Dude. I mean, there's always
the boxes in the basement.

16:15.437 --> 16:16.932
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

16:17.681 --> 16:18.398
Come on.

16:25.153 --> 16:28.941
Hey. So... we'll stop
by Mandarin King tonight,

16:28.985 --> 16:32.053
and for breakfast I got
those toaster things you like.

16:32.126 --> 16:34.880
We had Kung Pao chicken last
night, so try to avoid chinese.

16:34.987 --> 16:36.505
But she likes chinese
food. Don't you, sweetheart?

16:36.780 --> 16:37.600
It's fine.

16:38.275 --> 16:39.596
You like chinese.

16:41.776 --> 16:43.677
Hey, is that that Shalimar I bought you?

16:43.770 --> 16:46.305
Nope, it's the Chanel I bought me.

16:48.542 --> 16:53.483
So your mom seems to be
in good spirits. Terrific.

16:55.636 --> 16:56.423
Yeah.

16:57.319 --> 17:01.666
Jeez, you guys have so much
food in the house, I'm jealous.

17:01.871 --> 17:05.067
We had this guy deliver
groceries this morning, Vince.

17:05.481 --> 17:06.276
Vince?

17:06.377 --> 17:08.869
And it was expensive,
like 80 bucks for nothing.

17:09.040 --> 17:13.137
Yeah, that's not like your
mother to throw away money.

17:19.442 --> 17:21.877
So... how are you, Joy?

17:22.299 --> 17:23.146
I'm great.

17:23.803 --> 17:26.280
So I hear you've been getting
your, uh... groceries delivered.

17:26.696 --> 17:29.178
Yeah, just thought we'd
try something different.

17:29.393 --> 17:31.141
- Good for you.
- What does that mean?

17:31.392 --> 17:33.195
Whatever makesn you
happy, and if it's...

17:34.033 --> 17:37.106
Vince the grocery boy, good for you.

17:38.227 --> 17:40.645
- How's Charlotte?
- She's good.

17:40.711 --> 17:41.848
Big plans for the weekend?

17:42.759 --> 17:43.707
Nothing special.

17:44.285 --> 17:47.071
Already settling in to
a routine, I guess, hmm?

17:47.511 --> 17:49.427
That's how it is with
long-term relationships.

17:49.601 --> 17:50.333
Yep.

17:51.615 --> 17:53.114
Good for you.

17:56.915 --> 17:58.347
I'll go get your bag, sweetheart.

18:00.292 --> 18:01.737
Did you tell your mother
about Charlotte and me?

18:02.386 --> 18:03.032
No.

18:03.864 --> 18:05.335
You know I don't like lying, Reggie.

18:06.259 --> 18:07.452
Okay. I told her.

18:07.933 --> 18:09.325
So what's your mom up to these days?

18:09.414 --> 18:10.461
Pilates.

18:20.490 --> 18:23.269
Reggie's got a human development
assignment due monday.

18:29.679 --> 18:30.868
Clancy.

18:36.529 --> 18:37.724
Marvin Gaye.

18:37.914 --> 18:39.148
Due monday.

18:44.181 --> 18:45.027
Hello.

18:46.072 --> 18:50.080
Well, get somebody else. Bill,
it's not like I'm-- I'm...

18:50.470 --> 18:52.052
Of course. I understand.

18:54.293 --> 18:56.456
I can be there in an hour.

19:00.586 --> 19:02.289
You're unbelievable.

19:02.523 --> 19:05.171
Department meeting. It came
completely out of the blue.

19:05.274 --> 19:06.917
Don't do this, Clancy.

19:07.375 --> 19:08.629
I can pick her up in the morning.

19:08.695 --> 19:11.818
- Your phone didn't ring.
- It was on vibrate.

19:12.642 --> 19:16.529
Reggie, your father has
an unexpected conflict.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.258
So you'll be staying with me tonight.

19:20.042 --> 19:21.041
Sorry, honey.

19:27.408 --> 19:28.992
I want to live with grandma.

19:42.054 --> 19:44.810
Linda, I got those flaming
sambucas racked and ready.

19:44.933 --> 19:47.719
Hi. I'll be with you in a sec,
hon. I gotta get these out.

19:48.907 --> 19:51.621
Like booze isn't
dangerous enough by itself.

19:51.707 --> 19:55.323
Here's a thought. Let's light the booze
on fire and hand it to drunk people.

19:55.602 --> 19:56.920
Recipe for disaster?

19:56.997 --> 19:58.446
That's just what I was thinking.

19:58.675 --> 20:01.046
Listen, my friends are
getting ready to go to a club.

20:01.166 --> 20:02.978
- They want to go dancing--
- I don't want to go dancing.

20:03.055 --> 20:04.786
I was thinking you
don't want to go dancing.

20:04.889 --> 20:06.608
-  I was hoping instead--
- You can't buy me a drink.

20:06.660 --> 20:07.669
I can't finish a sentence.

20:09.621 --> 20:11.069
Finish your sentence.

20:11.140 --> 20:12.755
I was hoping I could buy you a drink.

20:13.670 --> 20:15.790
- You're not a good listener.
- I heard you.

20:15.994 --> 20:17.806
I thought you might
have changed your mind.

20:18.306 --> 20:20.182
No, but thank you.

20:20.576 --> 20:21.806
The pleasure's all mine.

20:24.661 --> 20:25.575
Who is that?

20:25.657 --> 20:26.921
His name is Ray Summers,

20:26.972 --> 20:29.084
and that is the first time I
ever saw a woman say no to him.

20:29.229 --> 20:30.358
Good for you.

20:30.737 --> 20:31.515
Good for me.

20:32.865 --> 20:36.686
I'm looking for a mr. or mrs. B. Briggs.

20:36.814 --> 20:39.012
Oh, you mean buddy.
See those two cowboys?

20:39.253 --> 20:41.224
The guy who wins is Buddy Briggs.

20:42.281 --> 20:46.176
Who's next? Better bring a sack
lunch and your daddy's shoes.

20:46.253 --> 20:47.388
This is a man's game.

20:49.859 --> 20:51.491
Now we're talking.

20:51.703 --> 20:53.534
Hell, I'm in the mood for some pain.

20:53.595 --> 20:55.280
Looks like you're gonna
get your wish, Buddy.

20:56.953 --> 20:58.040
Hey, pretty girl.

20:58.357 --> 21:00.089
What'll you give me if
I take this guy down?

21:13.457 --> 21:14.473
Damn.

21:15.114 --> 21:17.211
Show them a little
country, now, you hear?

21:18.562 --> 21:19.782
You're going down, boy.

21:45.623 --> 21:46.690
You all right there, Buddy?

21:47.646 --> 21:49.097
I feel a little warm, is all.

21:51.256 --> 21:52.339
What the...

21:57.275 --> 22:00.644
That guy's on fire.
Seven ball, side pocket.

22:01.884 --> 22:03.490
Dang, I burned up.

22:03.627 --> 22:05.734
Spontaneous human combustion.

22:05.878 --> 22:07.470
I always thought that was a myth.

22:11.152 --> 22:12.811
So are you going on your date?

22:12.965 --> 22:15.679
Hmm. Thanks to your father, no.

22:16.112 --> 22:18.342
Why is this guy still coming over?

22:18.736 --> 22:22.693
Well, because it's-- it's more
polite to say no in person.

22:22.886 --> 22:27.522
- You just want to see him.
- Reggie, I'm being polite.

22:28.025 --> 22:29.920
When was the last time you had a date?

22:31.315 --> 22:32.511
20 years ago.

22:32.582 --> 22:34.959
You haven't kissed anyone
but dad in 20 years?

22:36.752 --> 22:37.728
Yeah.

22:37.861 --> 22:39.259
Do you think you forgot how?

22:40.207 --> 22:42.843
I really don't think they've
changed it all that much.

22:42.894 --> 22:44.212
Hurry, upstairs. Scoot, scoot.

22:45.832 --> 22:47.975
Maybe you should practice
on your arm, like this...

22:48.194 --> 22:49.571
Upstairs now.

22:54.332 --> 22:57.873
Hi, Joy. My god, you look great.

22:57.939 --> 23:00.039
Oh, thank you, Angelo.

23:02.033 --> 23:03.654
So this is Beatrice Lane.

23:04.725 --> 23:05.811
As advertised.

23:08.329 --> 23:09.757
This is going to sound terrible.

23:10.366 --> 23:14.448
I-I really-- I really
wanted to do this evening,

23:14.504 --> 23:17.778
but I thought my ex was
going to take Reggie.

23:17.843 --> 23:19.893
But I just found out that he can't.

23:20.027 --> 23:22.390
Oh, that's not a problem.
Let's just bring her along.

23:22.478 --> 23:23.163
Yes!

23:24.135 --> 23:25.058
Reggie.

23:25.692 --> 23:26.651
Hi, Reggie.

23:27.292 --> 23:28.700
I'm Angelo. You remember me?

23:29.191 --> 23:31.443
You owned the apartment we looked at.

23:31.532 --> 23:32.288
Yeah.

23:33.112 --> 23:35.002
You have any plans for
this evening, Reggie?

23:36.732 --> 23:38.134
Well, you do now.

23:39.909 --> 23:40.625
Cool.

23:40.934 --> 23:42.136
Well, let's go.

23:43.035 --> 23:43.758
I'm changing.

23:49.548 --> 23:51.209
This, Joseph, is a system.

23:52.013 --> 23:54.255
Everything in its place, laid out.

23:55.035 --> 23:57.221
You can touch it. You can see it.

23:57.871 --> 24:00.451
Sure, but no internet porn.

24:02.349 --> 24:04.840
Someone ever tell you that
stuff'll make you go blind?

24:05.254 --> 24:06.427
Acceptable risk.

24:07.852 --> 24:11.585
Hey, here's a birth certificate
for a Rose Sofer. That help?

24:11.786 --> 24:12.760
Lucy's daughter.

24:34.135 --> 24:35.998
Let's make a pile for
this one right here, huh?

24:37.479 --> 24:42.754
Man, this shit is old... like, 80 years.

24:43.143 --> 24:45.703
Fucking... indians
still roaming the plains.

24:47.890 --> 24:49.544
You smoke a lot of marijuana, Joey?

24:49.958 --> 24:51.356
Not till after work.

24:54.078 --> 24:57.449
You'd think someone burning to a crisp
would have thinned out the crowd a little.

24:57.743 --> 24:59.350
Just by one, I'm afraid.

24:59.734 --> 25:02.830
- I wasn't talking to you.
- But you desperately want to.

25:02.892 --> 25:04.515
Want to let me buy you a drink or not?

25:04.581 --> 25:06.594
- You do what you want to do.
- Noted.

25:07.141 --> 25:07.956
Macy?

25:08.684 --> 25:09.949
I'll have one more. Thanks.

25:11.695 --> 25:14.398
So, what, people around here
just don't care that a man died?

25:14.806 --> 25:15.960
You're still here.

25:16.158 --> 25:17.558
Death doesn't scare me.

25:17.971 --> 25:19.018
Noted.

25:20.671 --> 25:21.843
You want a drink, sweetheart?

25:21.905 --> 25:24.071
- A shot of tequila.
- What kind?

25:24.133 --> 25:25.961
Whatever's the most
expensive. He's buying.

25:28.668 --> 25:29.822
So, what's your name?

25:29.893 --> 25:31.091
That's a little personal.

25:31.246 --> 25:32.536
I-- I really think
you should back off.

25:33.008 --> 25:34.135
Funny boy.

25:35.506 --> 25:36.755
I know it's Ray.

25:36.827 --> 25:39.377
- Then why did you ask?
- Just making conversation.

25:39.592 --> 25:41.747
I think we've moved
past that little number.

25:41.804 --> 25:43.423
I don't think we have.

25:43.755 --> 25:47.334
Okay. Then why don't
we start with your name,

25:47.386 --> 25:48.564
and we'll go on from there.

25:49.045 --> 25:51.021
That's a little personal,
but thanks for the cocktail.

25:53.874 --> 25:54.985
I want her.

25:55.851 --> 25:56.957
Whoever she is.

26:00.676 --> 26:06.072
Hey, barkeep, dos cervezas, por
favor, then dos more. Gracias.

26:06.138 --> 26:09.731
Georgie, some vague notion of
immortality not withstanding,

26:09.773 --> 26:11.335
that is not a proper way to drive a car,

26:11.387 --> 26:13.666
and I swear to god, I hope
one of these beers is mine.

26:13.763 --> 26:15.119
- No.
- You made it.

26:15.518 --> 26:18.135
Thank god. She is in
such a bloody bad mood.

26:18.540 --> 26:19.630
You finishing that?

26:22.325 --> 26:24.352
What's that smell? It
smells like Buffalo Wings.

26:24.439 --> 26:28.121
- Yeah, that's Buddy. He got burned.
- Good. One less man in the world.

26:29.101 --> 26:31.152
- Excuse me.
- Ugh.

26:31.673 --> 26:34.966
- Hi. I'm Ray.
- Fuck you, ray.

26:35.035 --> 26:36.186
Nice spending time with you guys.

26:36.272 --> 26:37.559
Ray, this
is Mason--

26:37.902 --> 26:40.210
Mason, Ray--
and George.

26:40.278 --> 26:41.480
Curious George.

26:41.572 --> 26:43.999
So, Daisy, what's going on? I
thought it was just the three of us.

26:44.215 --> 26:46.934
- Daisy?
- Daisy Adair.

26:48.720 --> 26:50.483
So, what do you do, Ray?

26:50.553 --> 26:52.346
I'm a television producer, George.

26:52.556 --> 26:54.537
- So you're rich?
- Comfortable.

26:54.614 --> 26:57.012
- I suppose you're charming.
- $Tolerable.

26:57.088 --> 27:00.083
And women just fall
the fuck all over you.

27:00.145 --> 27:01.942
Not you, I suspect.

27:02.014 --> 27:04.433
- Georgia, you're being impolite.
- No, no, it's okay.

27:04.494 --> 27:05.967
Everybody likes me eventually.

27:06.049 --> 27:08.261
- Okay, Daisy, I need a word with you.
- I don't think so.

27:09.019 --> 27:10.652
So, what's your deal, asshole?

27:11.089 --> 27:13.971
Oh, I'm just happy to make
a new friend, Daisy here.

27:14.038 --> 27:16.659
- Daisy, really, a word.
- Really, not now.

27:16.720 --> 27:18.358
Ray. Is it ray?

27:18.456 --> 27:19.598
Ray. Ray, hey.

27:19.654 --> 27:21.739
So has daisy told
you of her extensive--

27:21.781 --> 27:24.382
some might say intimate--
knowledge of Errol Flynn?

27:24.749 --> 27:26.854
Oh, yeah? I love those old movies.

27:27.338 --> 27:28.211
Excuse us.

27:31.242 --> 27:32.513
Your fly's undone.

27:34.274 --> 27:35.410
What are you doing?

27:35.872 --> 27:36.741
I told you.

27:37.408 --> 27:38.632
I'm worried about George.

27:39.547 --> 27:41.381
She's been acting really odd.

27:41.735 --> 27:43.394
You just saw it back there, didn't you?

27:43.461 --> 27:45.632
She's got a crush on
a boy. She'll be fine.

27:45.688 --> 27:47.035
You don't fucking understand.

27:47.095 --> 27:50.824
Earlier, it was shouting, it was
mayhem, it was chaos, all right?

27:50.886 --> 27:52.252
George is a big girl,

27:52.376 --> 27:53.871
and even if she's not a big girl,

27:54.578 --> 27:55.428
she's a dead girl.

27:55.494 --> 27:56.692
She's going to be okay,

27:57.445 --> 27:58.279
and in case you haven't noticed,

27:58.332 --> 28:00.304
I'm kind of in the middle
of something, so excuse me--

28:00.491 --> 28:02.856
- Just fucking wait.
- What is it, Mason?

28:03.111 --> 28:03.840
All right.

28:03.887 --> 28:08.998
I've always found your
stories charmingly naughty.

28:09.059 --> 28:11.076
The legendary blowjobs of yore.

28:11.277 --> 28:15.634
They were all quite romantic
in their fashion, you know?

28:16.528 --> 28:17.569
Thank you.

28:18.747 --> 28:21.179
I've never actually seen
you with another man.

28:22.121 --> 28:23.513
I'm not with him.

28:29.276 --> 28:31.544
I'm sorry. I have to check my rouge.

28:34.280 --> 28:38.062
Well, Mason, I guess it's time for
you to get pretty well shitfaced.

28:39.616 --> 28:42.834
All you have to do is just pull
on it a little bit, like that,

28:42.886 --> 28:45.636
and it turns. Good. Good.

28:45.686 --> 28:49.480
If you want it to turn faster,
you just punch out into the air.

28:49.526 --> 28:51.560
Just a little. Just a little. Good.

28:51.617 --> 28:53.163
Oh! No!

28:54.561 --> 28:56.255
I'm terrible at this.

28:56.498 --> 28:58.779
Just takes practice. You go launch it.

29:00.315 --> 29:03.113
- You having fun?
- Yeah. Yeah.

29:03.501 --> 29:05.462
Not exactly what I'd hoped for, but...

29:06.048 --> 29:07.132
What did you want?

29:07.592 --> 29:09.676
Well, you know, that
we'd have a little dinner,

29:09.775 --> 29:11.725
maybe a couple of glasses of wine,

29:12.002 --> 29:14.121
some awkward conversation,

29:14.208 --> 29:15.473
and then I attack you.

29:18.109 --> 29:20.666
- Okay, well, that's
good to know. - Mm-hmm.

29:22.217 --> 29:25.965
All right, Reggie, toss
it up in the air! Nice.

29:26.333 --> 29:28.470
Okay. I'm ready. My turn.

29:28.569 --> 29:29.823
- Ready?
- Show me what to do.

29:30.655 --> 29:31.897
All right, now.

29:32.072 --> 29:32.971
Good.

29:33.507 --> 29:34.567
Hold on.

29:34.874 --> 29:36.448
Don't let go, okay?

29:37.251 --> 29:38.532
I can't control it.

29:38.781 --> 29:39.704
Just don't let go.

29:39.802 --> 29:41.393
That's the thing about kites.

29:41.686 --> 29:45.291
You have to hold on tight so
they can fight against the wind...

29:45.378 --> 29:47.504
That's it, georgia.
That's good. Hang on.

29:47.631 --> 29:49.004
It's pulling too hard

29:49.126 --> 29:50.223
Don't let go, George.

29:50.417 --> 29:52.095
Because the second you let go,

29:52.930 --> 29:54.970
all the life goes out of them.

29:57.304 --> 29:58.266
Shit.

30:02.177 --> 30:03.628
So, what's that about?

30:04.698 --> 30:06.399
Probably you.

30:07.972 --> 30:10.310
I find your friend Daisy
painfully attractive.

30:10.497 --> 30:11.415
Take a number.

30:12.276 --> 30:13.173
How do you know her?

30:13.296 --> 30:15.242
That's none of your fucking business.

30:15.364 --> 30:17.059
You're an angry little
thing, aren't you?

30:18.257 --> 30:19.747
You call me a "little thing" again,

30:19.838 --> 30:22.713
and I'll put this fucking dart
right between your twinkling eyes.

30:22.882 --> 30:24.479
- Another tequila?
- Please.

30:28.578 --> 30:30.768
Are you the
love-'em-and-leave-'em type?

30:31.193 --> 30:34.137
- I've done that.
- What is up with that?

30:34.367 --> 30:35.596
What's the matter, George?

30:36.256 --> 30:39.688
- Some boy not nice to you?
- No, I'm good.

30:39.829 --> 30:42.192
I'll bet you are. Macy. Two more.

30:43.733 --> 30:46.805
Okay, George, five reasons men are scum

30:47.040 --> 30:48.772
and women let us get away with it.

30:49.013 --> 30:51.808
One, we only want one
thing, no exceptions.

30:52.103 --> 30:54.916
Two, we fall in love with you
before we can have that thing,

30:54.973 --> 30:56.596
and then fall back
out once we've had it,

30:56.657 --> 30:58.947
whereas women, conversely,
fall in love afterwards.

30:59.280 --> 31:03.406
Three, we will lie, cheat, steal,
or murder in order to get that thing.

31:03.468 --> 31:05.112
Why am I sugar-coating
this? You're a big girl.

31:05.167 --> 31:06.295
In order to fuck you.

31:06.613 --> 31:10.242
Four, we freely admit to numbers one
through three, and women don't care,

31:10.370 --> 31:12.562
and the number five
reason why men are scum

31:12.608 --> 31:13.923
and women let us
get away with it--

31:14.169 --> 31:15.866
you can't live without us.

31:16.224 --> 31:17.673
Here's to your bullshit, Ray.

31:25.066 --> 31:26.259
Fucking men.

31:27.310 --> 31:28.717
What do you think his surprise is?

31:29.003 --> 31:30.376
I have no idea.

31:30.775 --> 31:32.209
Okay, Reggie. Time for bed.

31:32.921 --> 31:36.364
- It's 7:00.
- Exactly. Time for bed.

31:36.430 --> 31:37.742
You're going to try and kiss him.

31:38.055 --> 31:40.602
What is this obsession with kissing?

31:40.715 --> 31:41.631
I'm 11.

31:42.032 --> 31:44.607
Okay, you two. Close your eyes.

31:44.762 --> 31:47.434
Oh, I know what this is.

31:47.614 --> 31:49.200
Of course, you do.

31:52.553 --> 31:54.132
That's so good.

31:54.306 --> 31:55.350
Did you do that?

31:55.931 --> 31:58.864
I did two of them. This one's for you.

31:59.119 --> 32:00.487
It looks just like her.

32:01.736 --> 32:02.596
Sad.

32:03.974 --> 32:05.340
Say good night, Reggie.

32:08.004 --> 32:08.930
Good night.

32:09.122 --> 32:11.035
And thank you for the kite-flying.

32:11.564 --> 32:13.401
And thank you for the kite-flying.

32:13.482 --> 32:14.358
You're welcome.

32:15.922 --> 32:18.328
She likes you, and she
doesn't like anybody.

32:18.665 --> 32:20.098
She seemed to have a good time.

32:20.559 --> 32:21.523
Me too.

32:23.022 --> 32:23.877
I'm glad.

32:24.191 --> 32:25.321
Do you like R & B?

32:26.119 --> 32:30.484
Always been a jazz man, myself,
but I'd probably better go.

32:36.138 --> 32:38.010
And that is how you pay my rent.

32:38.927 --> 32:40.969
- You're good, Mason.
- Yes.

32:41.040 --> 32:43.996
- Go again?
- Of course... Ray.

32:44.318 --> 32:46.040
Just feels so good in
my hand, this money.

32:46.091 --> 32:49.009
I don't know why. But I
love taking it from you, Ray.

32:50.392 --> 32:53.085
- Oh, come on.
- You got a bet on this?

32:53.999 --> 32:56.788
My dad used to say, "never
bet on anything that can talk.

32:57.330 --> 33:00.209
If it can talk, it can be bought."

33:03.752 --> 33:05.079
So what about Daisy?

33:05.348 --> 33:06.594
What about Daisy?

33:07.159 --> 33:08.917
You've obviously got feelings for her.

33:10.100 --> 33:12.995
If you want me to step
off, now's your moment.

33:13.051 --> 33:15.288
No, of course not. Me and
daisy are just friends.

33:15.339 --> 33:17.653
She's a lovely girl, but
no. Just friends, all right?

33:18.954 --> 33:22.498
Hey. We've got next.

33:23.767 --> 33:26.502
Take a walk, junior. There's
plenty of tables available.

33:26.553 --> 33:27.772
Yeah, yeah, yeah. What he said.

33:27.835 --> 33:32.555
Well, I like this table, so if
you wouldn't mind fucking off...

33:33.197 --> 33:34.101
Excuse me.

33:34.410 --> 33:35.944
Is it three against two, is it?

33:36.017 --> 33:37.020
Because I'll have you know,

33:37.091 --> 33:39.858
I've had my ass kicked  by bigger
cocksuckers than you, all right?

33:39.924 --> 33:40.923
Whoa, Mason.

33:42.413 --> 33:43.671
We don't want any trouble.

33:44.775 --> 33:47.139
These folks have next,
we'll get out of your way.

33:49.736 --> 33:51.931
Don't tell me to fuck off.

33:52.155 --> 33:53.938
I tell people to fuck off.

33:54.865 --> 33:56.546
Now, fuck off.

34:01.204 --> 34:02.163
Your break.

34:07.105 --> 34:09.889
Death isn't like holding on to a kite...

34:09.995 --> 34:11.119
or a boy...

34:11.726 --> 34:13.315
or most anything else,

34:13.929 --> 34:17.039
because sometimes, even
if you want to let go,

34:17.254 --> 34:18.810
it won't let you.

34:22.342 --> 34:23.639
This is the last one, dude.

34:25.072 --> 34:26.235
What do you got there?

34:26.947 --> 34:28.175
Death certificate.

34:28.626 --> 34:29.435
Whose?

34:30.516 --> 34:31.303
The mother.

34:31.871 --> 34:33.819
Well, everyone's got to die, right?

34:34.789 --> 34:36.451
Yeah, that's right.

34:36.523 --> 34:37.469
You're going to love this.

34:37.547 --> 34:38.995
This one's got the
daughter's name on it.

34:40.623 --> 34:41.418
Sorry.

34:47.405 --> 34:48.422
Dude...

34:52.021 --> 34:53.723
This guy looks just like you.

34:57.299 --> 34:58.383
Can I see it?

35:02.424 --> 35:04.435
Huh. Souvenir.

35:05.833 --> 35:08.179
I want to do a duet.
Something country/western.

35:08.393 --> 35:09.761
Fuck that, Daisy.

35:09.960 --> 35:12.454
I'm not going to sing
some hillbilly bullshit.

35:12.520 --> 35:14.969
If we're going to go
hillbilly, I want to fight.

35:15.266 --> 35:17.873
Georgia, he works for television,
he's gorgeous, and he wants me,

35:17.924 --> 35:20.709
so unless you really do want a
fight, you're singing with me.

35:22.675 --> 35:23.791
This isn't on.

35:24.037 --> 35:24.877
Hello.

35:25.337 --> 35:27.253
Daisy, I'm really not up for this.

35:27.325 --> 35:29.905
Uh, excuse me, hi.
Testing. This isn't on.

35:29.990 --> 35:30.996
I'm not singing.

35:31.695 --> 35:34.836
Relax, have fun. Men like
girls who can have fun.

35:34.898 --> 35:36.266
Is that what men like?

35:36.425 --> 35:38.447
Yeah. You know what? You
really need to get laid.

35:38.509 --> 35:40.347
Oh, well, for your information, Daisy...

35:40.397 --> 35:42.102
I lost my virginity.

35:49.867 --> 35:56.604
Yes, that's what done happened
to me and he don't even call

35:57.214 --> 35:58.944
Who wrote that? Janis joplin?

35:59.264 --> 36:01.612
No, he don't not at all

36:03.217 --> 36:06.682
why won't he pick up the
phone and just call me?

36:07.216 --> 36:08.094
Boo!

36:08.565 --> 36:09.468
Screw this.

36:12.627 --> 36:13.754
Gee, thank you.

36:19.442 --> 36:20.605
Bloody hell.

36:26.358 --> 36:29.524
- I'm guessing you're
an actress. - Uh-huh.

36:30.759 --> 36:32.587
And I produce a TV show.

36:33.983 --> 36:37.622
And you're going to put me on it
and make my career, blah blah blah.

36:37.684 --> 36:38.583
I've heard it all.

36:41.314 --> 36:46.142
You know, Daisy, you want to be the
world-weary ingenue, you go for it.

36:46.324 --> 36:48.058
I'm sure you play her very well.

36:48.682 --> 36:51.579
It's just not very
interesting, you know?

36:51.740 --> 36:53.930
At least, not to me.

36:56.099 --> 36:58.948
Well, you're interesting to me.

37:04.370 --> 37:06.243
You want to go somewhere with me?

37:11.730 --> 37:12.952
I really do.

37:19.053 --> 37:21.504
George, will you slow
down? I can't keep up.

37:21.876 --> 37:26.602
They mock me. Couples mock me.

37:26.663 --> 37:28.233
Yeah, me too, darling.

37:28.299 --> 37:29.523
I'm such an idiot.

37:29.569 --> 37:31.863
You know, I don't remember the
first time I ever did it. I don't.

37:31.945 --> 37:34.019
I was drinking, a lot, and I woke up,

37:34.244 --> 37:36.134
and my mates told me I was a man now,

37:36.206 --> 37:37.849
and I don't remember a bloody thing.

37:38.806 --> 37:40.523
At least you were still alive.

37:40.625 --> 37:41.926
Well, not for much longer.

37:42.335 --> 37:46.242
So anyway, now Mason is
going to show little Georgie

37:46.298 --> 37:48.884
a few of the finer
points of stress relief

37:49.012 --> 37:50.749
through petty vandalism.

37:50.917 --> 37:55.223
Oh, yes, we will egg Trip's
fucking mansion, but first...

37:57.042 --> 38:00.498
you see, the pleasure comes from
being a shadow in the night, silent,

38:01.048 --> 38:04.860
until they arrive back at
their smug little establishment,

38:04.921 --> 38:06.525
only to
find a big--

38:07.567 --> 38:08.465
George!

38:08.931 --> 38:09.854
Georgie,
I--

38:11.513 --> 38:13.530
I don't think I've explained
to you properly the, uh...

38:13.632 --> 38:16.603
the finer details of the "shadow
in the night" philosophy, george.

38:16.695 --> 38:20.198
See, uh, now is a good
time to run away. Georgie...

38:28.924 --> 38:30.438
Hello, officer.

38:31.283 --> 38:32.450
Evening, ma'am.

38:36.238 --> 38:37.566
Beat, beat, mutilate!

38:37.653 --> 38:38.785
Crush, crush, kill!

38:38.876 --> 38:41.460
Yank out their organs and
throw 'em on the grill!

38:41.554 --> 38:42.599
Whoo!

38:43.798 --> 38:47.711
- Settle down, ladies.
- Sorry. We're so sorry.

38:48.544 --> 38:50.275
- Ready?
- Okay!

38:50.541 --> 38:52.359
We eat salad, we stay fit!

38:52.442 --> 38:54.234
Not like your team. You eat...

38:54.276 --> 38:55.590
shift to the left, shift to the right,

38:55.688 --> 38:57.685
stand up, sit down, fight, fight, fight!

38:57.787 --> 38:58.729
Whoo!

38:58.975 --> 39:00.680
What are you guys in for?

39:00.936 --> 39:02.808
Grand theft pom-pom?

39:02.918 --> 39:04.398
Try assault and battery.

39:04.608 --> 39:06.718
Their mascot tried to
fuck with our mascot.

39:07.117 --> 39:09.139
You got to draw the line somewhere.

39:10.200 --> 39:11.507
Is that a frog?

39:12.782 --> 39:15.361
A frog? It's a sea turtle.

39:16.052 --> 39:17.241
Sea turtles...

39:17.825 --> 39:18.330
Snap!

39:20.260 --> 39:22.254
Roxy. Finally.

39:23.905 --> 39:26.477
- What did you do?
- I broke a window.

39:27.423 --> 39:29.100
A really big window.

39:29.238 --> 39:33.784
- Is this about a boy?
- I guess. I don't know.

39:34.174 --> 39:37.790
You know, George, men
have made me act crazy too.

39:37.862 --> 39:40.632
I mean, if you haven't bought a
gun or a pick-ax at some point,

39:40.694 --> 39:42.292
it isn't a real relationship.

39:42.362 --> 39:46.101
Thank you, Roxy. So here's
what I'm going to do.

39:46.440 --> 39:48.790
Thank god. Unlock this thing.

39:50.242 --> 39:51.656
Your one phone call.

39:54.229 --> 39:57.473
- I don't understand.
- Sure you do.

39:58.313 --> 39:59.640
You want to be a girl

39:59.842 --> 40:01.346
or you want to be a woman?

40:01.426 --> 40:02.359
You choose.

40:06.391 --> 40:08.717
If you're young
and not so innocent--

40:08.758 --> 40:11.385
I mean, if it's your
first time in the slammer--

40:11.598 --> 40:13.040
you call your mom.

40:13.145 --> 40:15.098
She knows exactly what to say.

40:28.828 --> 40:30.296
Your daughter's upstairs.

40:31.540 --> 40:32.796
I know.

40:34.265 --> 40:34.998
Who's this?

40:37.443 --> 40:39.749
Oh, that's... that's my other daughter.

40:39.905 --> 40:42.812
I should have seen that.
She's pretty, like her mother.

40:43.764 --> 40:44.880
Thank you.

40:46.937 --> 40:47.917
What's her name?

40:49.786 --> 40:50.846
Georgia.

40:52.428 --> 40:55.203
So, uh... so what are we doing?

40:55.270 --> 40:56.933
Are we kissing some more?

41:08.010 --> 41:10.555
I think I should probably go.

41:13.054 --> 41:14.049
Okay.

41:21.294 --> 41:22.922
I had a really great time, Joy.

41:23.961 --> 41:25.176
Me too.

41:25.817 --> 41:27.064
And I like kissing you.

41:29.137 --> 41:29.967
It's just..

41:30.203 --> 41:32.562
I'm just not comfortable with
your daughter being so close.

41:32.949 --> 41:33.649
Yeah.

41:38.278 --> 41:40.628
You're a really good man, Angelo.

41:41.991 --> 41:45.222
You're so careful with people.

41:46.280 --> 41:48.719
You don't have to be so careful with me.

41:59.498 --> 42:00.830
I'll call you.

42:02.628 --> 42:03.389
Okay.

42:31.759 --> 42:34.969
Oh, god, I thought you were
never going to get here.

42:35.856 --> 42:37.095
What are you wearing?

42:37.207 --> 42:39.367
One of us was enjoying
the company of a man

42:39.424 --> 42:42.532
while watching a little
jousting this evening, Millie.

42:42.600 --> 42:43.601
What happened?

42:44.528 --> 42:46.722
I disturbed the peace.

42:49.038 --> 42:51.591
Bye, Becky, Becky, Shasta.

42:52.760 --> 42:54.432
It'll be a few minutes
for the paper, ma'am.

42:54.535 --> 42:57.351
Make sure I get a 1035 on
this, will you, officer?

43:02.165 --> 43:03.625
Millie, Millie, Millie.

43:04.160 --> 43:06.398
I'm sorry I screwed up your date.

43:06.497 --> 43:08.673
Oh, it's okay.

43:09.118 --> 43:12.616
There's no future for a man
who can't hold his grog, Millie.

43:14.572 --> 43:16.066
This your first time?

43:16.517 --> 43:19.789
Yes, and the asshole never even called.

43:21.263 --> 43:24.158
You were talking about
jail, weren't you?

43:24.244 --> 43:26.908
Millie, sweetheart,
it's an unwritten law.

43:26.963 --> 43:29.610
They never call when
it's your first time.

43:29.683 --> 43:31.275
Well, it stinks.

43:31.352 --> 43:33.636
That's what first times are for,

43:33.759 --> 43:35.775
and next time, it won't be your first.

43:36.540 --> 43:39.115
And that's what being
alive is all about.

43:41.251 --> 43:43.119
Yeah, I know.

43:43.999 --> 43:46.252
Losing your virginity is supposed to be

43:46.304 --> 43:49.100
one of the steps towards
being really alive.

43:49.408 --> 43:53.964
For me, it was one of the ways I
finally realized that it was over.

43:58.652 --> 44:00.893
You can't un-do what you've done.

44:05.411 --> 44:07.473
Some things you can't change.

44:07.624 --> 44:10.975
You can't un-spill water,
even if you want to.

44:12.726 --> 44:15.281
Some choices you can learn to live with,

44:15.354 --> 44:17.766
right through to the
clear light of morning.

44:19.762 --> 44:22.373
They say coming clean
is good for the soul,

44:22.435 --> 44:24.289
that it puts things in perspective.

44:28.027 --> 44:31.381
You can get a sense of your
place in the order of things...

44:34.981 --> 44:38.492
a sense of who you really
are and what's important.

44:45.798 --> 44:47.638
This is my perspective.

44:50.399 --> 44:52.693
I am a grim reaper.

44:52.845 --> 44:54.117
I take souls.

44:54.910 --> 44:56.666
I do not go to prom.

44:57.305 --> 45:00.226
I do not live happily ever after.

45:01.628 --> 45:03.754
This is who I am.

45:04.396 --> 45:06.529
Anyone got a problem with that?
