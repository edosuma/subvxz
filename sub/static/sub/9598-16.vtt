Thanks for stoppin'.

01:04.367 --> 01:05.534
I hope you know about engines,

[Grunts]

01:57.954 --> 01:59.388
That's my mine.

01:59.422 --> 02:01.356
I would not put your mail
in my mouth.

02:01.391 --> 02:04.860
By the way, bad idea
letting the mailbox overflow.

02:04.894 --> 02:09.131
It tells a burglar that you're
on vacation, even when you're not.

02:09.164 --> 02:12.701
- What's with the catalogues?
- I don't know.

02:12.735 --> 02:14.870
A few weeks ago,
they started arriving in droves.

02:14.904 --> 02:17.039
I was on one of those
"no junk mail" lists,

02:17.073 --> 02:19.775
but apparently I have been dropped.

02:20.209 --> 02:23.445
"A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

02:23.479 --> 02:26.648
to explore the ecosystem
of the Galубpagos Islands."

02:26.683 --> 02:30.819
Oh, the only island your father
ever took me to was Castle Island,

02:30.853 --> 02:34.723
- and that was for the submarine races.
- Well, technically,

02:34.757 --> 02:36.525
Castle Island hasn't really been
a Harbor Island

02:36.559 --> 02:39.594
since it was connected to Boston
proper with landfill in the 1800s.

02:39.629 --> 02:42.664
So I can't see you could watch
submarine races.

02:42.699 --> 02:44.900
That was the point.

02:44.934 --> 02:47.669
[Makes kissing noises]

02:47.704 --> 02:48.904
Gross, Ma.

02:48.938 --> 02:50.572
[Laughs]

02:50.606 --> 02:53.542
Anyway, I would like to go to
the Galубpagos islands.

02:53.576 --> 02:57.879
Swim with the turtles
and march with the penguins,

02:57.914 --> 03:00.916
whatever people do in the Galубpagos.

03:00.950 --> 03:02.184
All right, Mom, you let us know

03:02.185 --> 03:05.821
- how that works out for you...
- Oh, my!

03:05.855 --> 03:07.556
- Mm.
- Angela: Wow.

03:07.590 --> 03:10.792
Okay, those are beautiful.
Where did they come from?

03:10.827 --> 03:14.763
I don't know.
And they're not in my size.

03:14.797 --> 03:17.833
Chez Katia.

03:17.867 --> 03:22.037
Chez Katia? That's strange.
I haven't shopped there in ages.

03:22.071 --> 03:26.208
Mn-mh. Sounds like a
variation of the bait

03:26.242 --> 03:27.843
and switch ploy.
You know?

03:27.877 --> 03:31.446
Chez Katia is
a very reputable boutique.

03:31.481 --> 03:33.982
Yes, and Chez Katia sends you
a beautiful pair of shoes

03:34.017 --> 03:37.686
in the wrong size. You love
them, so you will go to Chez Katia

03:37.720 --> 03:39.721
and you will buy the right size.

03:39.756 --> 03:41.823
But while you're there,
mademoiselle...

03:41.858 --> 03:43.992
<i>[Imitates French accent]
maybe you could buy all ze shoes</i>

03:44.027 --> 03:46.061
<i>and give us all ze money.</i>

03:46.095 --> 03:47.629
[Laughs]

03:47.663 --> 03:50.232
Well, if it is a ploy,
it's going to work,

03:50.266 --> 03:51.867
'cause I'm gonna stop
and exchange them

03:51.901 --> 03:53.802

[Whispering] You know what?

03:58.708 --> 03:59.908
A couple of hours isn't gonna
make a difference.

03:59.942 --> 04:01.243
<i>[Lowered voice] Yeah.</i>

04:01.277 --> 04:03.678
Besides, those shoes

Not exactly the convivial

04:43.052 --> 04:45.987
Well, a very good morning
to you, Sergeant Korsak.

04:46.022 --> 04:49.291
Yes, it is a good morning.
Not so much for him.

04:49.325 --> 04:52.294
Yeah. Good point.
This is Todd Reynolds. 32.

04:52.328 --> 04:54.763
Night shift freight
manager at Rapid Courier.

04:54.797 --> 04:56.932
Reported missing by his wife
early this morning

04:56.966 --> 04:59.067
when she woke up and realized
he didn't make it home

04:59.102 --> 05:00.635
from his shift.
[camera shutter clicking]

05:00.670 --> 05:02.070
- Did someone move him?
- Not that I know of.

05:02.105 --> 05:03.672
He was dead when the cops found him.

05:03.706 --> 05:06.641
Road's pretty isolated.
Is this on his way home?

05:06.676 --> 05:08.543
Yeah. It's a straight shot
from where he works.

05:08.578 --> 05:13.048
No body damage to the car.
No skid marks or brake marks.

05:13.082 --> 05:15.550
Exterior's immaculate.
There's no sign of an accident.

05:15.585 --> 05:18.954
Well, it's parked pretty straight,

05:18.988 --> 05:22.157
telling us that he probably
wasn't forced off the road.

05:22.191 --> 05:24.793
Laptop and grocery bag
in the front seat.

05:24.827 --> 05:29.970
Well, that bag takes up the
entire backseat, so he was alone.

05:31.601 --> 05:34.136
Clothes are neatly folded,
so nobody's rifled through it.

05:34.170 --> 05:38.907
- And there's 40 bucks in his wallet.
- So it's not a robbery.

05:38.941 --> 05:41.109
And keys are in the ignition.

[Engine starts]

[Turns off engine]

05:44.013 --> 05:46.148
No.

05:46.182 --> 05:49.151
Well, everything seems to be in order.
What made him stop?

05:49.185 --> 05:50.619
Maybe he met someone.

05:50.653 --> 05:55.223
- Could be a sexual liaison gone awry.
- Do you think so, Mr. Holmes?

05:55.258 --> 05:57.759
Kiki suggested that I expand
my vocabulary

05:57.793 --> 06:00.262
- and not use cop talk all the time.
- Oh.

06:00.296 --> 06:04.199
It's a nice isolated spot
for a drug transaction.

06:04.233 --> 06:07.702
Maybe he was flagged down and then
beaten to death when he helped.

06:07.737 --> 06:09.271
Maura, did you find anything?

06:09.305 --> 06:12.207
<i>Well, the time of death was
approximately eight hours ago.</i>

06:12.241 --> 06:14.176
<i>There's significant blunt force trauma</i>

06:14.210 --> 06:16.912
confined to the area of
the head and the face.

06:16.946 --> 06:18.346
Defensive injuries?

06:18.381 --> 06:20.248
Can't be sure until after the autopsy.

06:20.283 --> 06:22.384
But if no one moved him,

06:22.418 --> 06:24.619
the only explanation
for that blood spatter

06:24.654 --> 06:26.087
is that the first blows didn't kill him.

06:26.122 --> 06:28.190
And the small drops here
indicate that the victim was

06:28.224 --> 06:30.292
low to the ground and moving forward.

06:30.326 --> 06:33.328
- Jane: He was crawling.
- And they increase in size here.

06:33.362 --> 06:34.930
He was trying to get to his feet.

06:34.964 --> 06:37.832
<i>Maura: Then the assailant
struck him again.</i>

06:37.867 --> 06:39.167
That looks like blood.

06:39.202 --> 06:40.969
Hey, can we get a picture of this?

06:41.003 --> 06:43.388
[Camera shutter clicks]
It's unlikely that our victim

06:43.389 --> 06:45.974
reached for a handkerchief while
he was being beaten to death.

06:46.008 --> 06:48.743
Well...

06:48.778 --> 06:52.045
maybe we caught a break,
and it belongs to our killer.

07:01.988 --> 07:03.589
Wife's name is Florence.

07:03.623 --> 07:06.725
Division detectives had already
notified her when I arrived.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.428
- She say anything?
- I haven't talked to her

07:09.462 --> 07:12.319
except to get permission
to search the office.

07:13.233 --> 07:16.669
- They have a son.
- How old?

07:16.703 --> 07:20.239
- 10.
- All right, thanks.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.743
Mrs. Reynolds?

07:25.578 --> 07:29.248
My name is Detective Jane Rizzoli.

07:29.282 --> 07:33.419
- I'm so sorry for your loss.
- I-I feel like if I...

07:33.453 --> 07:35.721
[voice breaking] stay here
and keep watching Logan,

07:35.755 --> 07:37.556
Todd will come home.

07:37.591 --> 07:38.657
[Sniffles]

07:40.327 --> 07:42.428

I don't know, 
but I will do my best to find out.

07:46.866 --> 07:51.804
- Can I ask you a couple questions?
- Okay.

07:51.838 --> 07:53.505
[Breathes deeply]

07:53.540 --> 07:56.108
Um, what time did Todd
normally get home from work?

07:56.142 --> 07:59.378
Around 2:00.
Sometimes a little later

07:59.412 --> 08:00.746
if he's hungry and he stops
for something to eat.

08:00.780 --> 08:04.350
- Was he meeting someone after work?
- Who would he be meeting?

08:05.352 --> 08:06.852
I-I-I don't understand.

08:06.886 --> 08:08.587
[Sighs]

08:08.622 --> 08:10.623
Do you know if Todd had
a drug problem?

08:10.657 --> 08:13.259
[Laughs]

08:13.293 --> 08:15.661
No, detective.

08:15.695 --> 08:20.332
Todd didn't use drugs.
He barely drank.

08:22.636 --> 08:27.806
- And no, he wasn't having an affair.
- How do you know for sure?

08:27.841 --> 08:32.443
I lost my job this year.
The bills started to pile up.

08:32.479 --> 08:34.413
Todd changed shifts
for the extra hours,

08:34.447 --> 08:37.750
<i>but every free moment he had,
he spent with us.</i>

08:37.784 --> 08:40.719
<i>There wasn't room in his day
for someone else.</i>

08:42.222 --> 08:44.723
What was his relationship like
with your son?

08:48.228 --> 08:52.865
They were in separable.
Peas in a pod.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.570
Do you mind if I ask him
a couple questions?

09:01.374 --> 09:02.775
[Whispers] Okay.

09:02.809 --> 09:05.844
- Sure.
- [Whispers] Thank you.

09:12.985 --> 09:14.687
Hey, Logan.

09:16.923 --> 09:19.858
My name is Jane Rizzoli.
I'm a detective.

09:19.893 --> 09:24.463
And I'm really sorry about
what happened to your dad.

09:29.803 --> 09:32.338
You ever seen one of those
up close before?

09:34.674 --> 09:38.044
You know why I have it?

09:38.378 --> 09:41.413
<i>- So people will know you're the police.
- That's right.</i>

09:41.448 --> 09:46.285
And it also reminds me
that I have a job to do,

09:46.319 --> 09:49.822
and that job is to help people
when bad things happen to them.

09:49.856 --> 09:53.695
- You understand?
- Yes.

09:55.595 --> 10:00.332
What helps me do my job
is if people talk to me.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.035
People like you.

10:06.573 --> 10:08.640
Is there anything you wanna tell me?

10:11.644 --> 10:14.947
I could really use your help, Logan.

10:20.687 --> 10:23.021
A man came here two days ago.

10:23.056 --> 10:26.291
Dad looked through the peephole
and sent me to my room.

10:26.326 --> 10:28.727
He say why you 
had to go to your room?

10:28.762 --> 10:32.965
- Dad wanted to talk in private.
- Can you tell me what they said?

10:35.068 --> 10:38.837
- Will you tell my mother?
- Not if I don't need to, no.

10:40.840 --> 10:45.978
- My dad didn't want her to know.
- Think he'd want me to know?

10:48.715 --> 10:50.949
The man came in
and was yelling a lot.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.919
Dad told him to be quiet
because I was in the other room.

10:53.953 --> 10:57.456
- The man kept yelling.
- And what did you do?

10:58.858 --> 11:00.559
I got scared and put
a pillow over my ears

11:00.593 --> 11:02.461
so I wouldn't hear the yelling anymore.

11:04.330 --> 11:07.633
But... But the man got madder.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.501
Dad said he was calling the police.

11:09.536 --> 11:14.339
- Did he call the police?
- No.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.408
The man left.

11:16.443 --> 11:19.478
I heard the door slam,
then it was quiet.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.981
You did a really good job
remembering all that.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.884
Thank you.

11:25.919 --> 11:27.586
Is there a reason

11:27.620 --> 11:29.721
that your father didn't want
your mother to know?

11:29.756 --> 11:33.491
- He said it would just make her worry.
- Mm. Right.

11:34.594 --> 11:36.628
Did you happen to get a look
at the guy at the door?

11:37.897 --> 11:41.099
No. I didn't.

11:41.134 --> 11:44.056
But I'll never forget his voice.

11:53.112 --> 11:54.713
<i>[Door closes] Hi.</i>

11:54.747 --> 11:58.851
Todd's son might be able to
identify his killer by his voice.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.819
Mm. There's a recent study
that shows

12:00.854 --> 12:03.622
that the ability to recognize
a voice diminishes with time.

12:03.656 --> 12:05.691
Almost 70% in less than 2 weeks.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.693
Well, then we should find
whoever did this quickly.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.628
Please, no dawdling, doctor.

12:09.662 --> 12:11.029
I don't know the meaning of the word.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.631
Well, of course I know
the meaning of the word.

12:12.665 --> 12:15.100
- I just meant that...
- Yeah, I got it. Yeah. Mm-hmm.

12:15.134 --> 12:18.537
- What's up, Chang?
- I have a preliminary toxicology report.

12:18.571 --> 12:21.406
Uh, the initial
toxicology screen was negative.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.609
And my physical examination
showed no evidence

12:23.643 --> 12:25.744
of any past substance abuse.

12:25.778 --> 12:27.679
So he wasn't making a
drug deal last night.

12:27.714 --> 12:29.014
Sexual assault?

12:29.048 --> 12:30.949
No indications of any recent
sexual activity.

12:30.984 --> 12:32.885
Hmm. Okay, what about
the handkerchief?

12:32.919 --> 12:34.853
Oh, we just started processing
the victim's clothing

12:34.888 --> 12:37.623
for trace evidence.
The handkerchief's up next.

12:37.657 --> 12:39.525
Uh, what about the murder weapon?

12:39.559 --> 12:43.829
Well, the initial strike was to
the front of the skull. Here.

12:43.863 --> 12:48.100
Mnh. Yes.
I'm thinking a piece of rebar.

12:49.536 --> 12:52.471
He was struck again
along the jawline near the neck,

12:52.505 --> 12:54.907
but as I expected, it was not fatal.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.475
Which is what we saw
at the crime scene.

12:56.509 --> 12:59.044
So the killer thought he was done.
Todd moved.

12:59.078 --> 13:01.113
He hit him again...

13:01.147 --> 13:04.716
probably with an iron pipe.

13:06.119 --> 13:09.688
This strike fractured the skull,
resulting in death.

13:09.722 --> 13:11.557
Yes, I hear you loud and clear.

13:11.591 --> 13:15.994
The murder weapon was long
and fat and soft.

13:18.998 --> 13:22.868
Fine. Fine.
The weapon was likely a metal rod,

13:22.902 --> 13:24.570
less than a half an inch thick.

13:27.907 --> 13:29.908
[Exhales sharply]
Yes, it could've been a tire iron

13:29.943 --> 13:32.477
or a piece of rebar or a steel pipe

13:32.512 --> 13:35.147
or about a thousand other
metal instrumentalities.

13:35.181 --> 13:37.583
Thank you.
Defensive wounds?

13:37.617 --> 13:40.786
No defensive wounds, Jane.
This attack was unexpected.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.187
So either he didn't see it coming,

13:42.221 --> 13:44.590
or he knew his killer
and wasn't afraid of him.

13:44.624 --> 13:47.593
- Or her.
- Do you think it was a jilted lover?

13:47.627 --> 13:52.030
- That's not what I said.
- [quietly] You kind of did.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.666
<i>Thanks, Chang.</i>

13:54.701 --> 13:57.035
I-I said that.
I didn't think you said that.

13:57.070 --> 14:01.940
You said something totally different
that implied something else.

14:04.711 --> 14:05.911
<i>Korsak: I spoke
with Todd's coworkers.</i>

14:05.945 --> 14:08.480
He was, by all accounts, a decent guy.

14:08.514 --> 14:11.717
Polite, considerate, and respectful.

14:11.751 --> 14:15.020
We confirmed he left at the end
of his shift at 2:00 A.M.

14:15.054 --> 14:16.555
Then he went to the all day market.

14:16.589 --> 14:21.226
He bought yogurt and a candy bar.
Receipt says 2:20 A.M.

14:21.260 --> 14:22.894
It's only a few minutes from the store

14:22.929 --> 14:25.530
to where we found his car and his body.

14:25.565 --> 14:28.834
And there's no evidence yet of any...
extramarital philandering.

14:31.004 --> 14:34.006
- Give it to me.
- But it's a gift from Kiki.

14:34.040 --> 14:38.010
And you can have it back when
you're promoted to lieutenant.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.879
Right now I need you to
speak like a real cop.

14:40.913 --> 14:43.582
As I was saying, if this guy
was screwing around,

14:43.616 --> 14:45.584
it'd be difficult to hide it
in this electronic age.

14:45.618 --> 14:47.819
<i>If there was an affair, it'll turn up.</i>

14:47.854 --> 14:50.656
I also put our M.O. into N.C.I.C.

14:50.690 --> 14:52.791
on the off chance that
this was a thrill kill,

14:52.825 --> 14:56.228
- somebody's done this before.
- Oh, god, I hope not.

14:56.262 --> 14:58.063
Some random, side of the road nutbag

14:58.097 --> 14:59.765
would really slow down
our investigation.

14:59.799 --> 15:01.600
If you use the thesaurus,

15:01.634 --> 15:03.872
you could come up with
a nicer word than "nutbag."

15:09.342 --> 15:13.078
"Nutholder."

15:13.112 --> 15:16.148
Financials show their credit
cards maxed out months ago.

15:16.182 --> 15:18.817
All the charges look like
household expenses.

15:18.851 --> 15:22.554
So if he's having an affair,
he's not charging it.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.623
They took out a second
mortgage six months ago.

15:24.657 --> 15:25.924
That money's gone.

15:25.958 --> 15:27.259
But there were
two large cash deposits

15:27.293 --> 15:29.327
into their checking account a month ago.

15:29.362 --> 15:30.962
Nobody's giving him a third mortgage.

15:30.997 --> 15:32.030
Do we know where
that money came from?

15:32.065 --> 15:34.326
- No place that files paperwork.
- Well, every neighborhood has

15:34.327 --> 15:36.001
the guy you go to
when the banks turn you down.

15:36.035 --> 15:37.736
Can you check around for a loan shark?

15:37.770 --> 15:39.838
<i>- Mm-Hmm.
- It's like you said.</i>

15:39.872 --> 15:42.574
It's hard to hide anything in
this electronic day and age...

15:42.608 --> 15:44.743
like maybe someone
who was incarcerated

15:44.777 --> 15:48.780
in a penal colony for usury.

15:50.016 --> 15:53.719
Mmm.
Delicious.

15:58.091 --> 16:00.325
Thank you, Shauna.
See you soon.

16:00.359 --> 16:02.027
May I help you?

16:02.061 --> 16:04.096
Yes. These shoes seem to have
been sent to me by accident.

16:04.130 --> 16:07.599
Oh, my goodness. I'm so sorry.
These were for Dr. Isles.

16:07.633 --> 16:10.368
- I understand, expect I ...
- I don't understand why these went out.

16:10.403 --> 16:13.071
They were supposed to be held
here with all her other selections.

16:13.106 --> 16:15.874
All of her other selections?

16:19.011 --> 16:24.816
- Oh. Is that...
- It is. Dr. Isles has incredible taste.

16:24.851 --> 16:26.151
I like to think so.
[chuckles]

16:26.185 --> 16:27.786
Do you know her?

16:29.789 --> 16:31.656
No, I don't.

16:31.691 --> 16:34.292
But I look forward to meeting her.

16:34.327 --> 16:37.295
- Do you have this in my size?
- We do.

16:40.933 --> 16:44.369
<i> Man: Come see me at 4:00.
 Don't make me come find you.</i>

16:44.403 --> 16:47.072
Loan-sharking has gotten a lot
easier in the age of voice mail.

16:47.106 --> 16:50.976
Yeah. No more chasing deadbeat
clients down dark alleys.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.844
Come on, guys.

16:52.879 --> 16:56.347
Do I look like someone who
chases people down dark alleys?

16:58.351 --> 17:01.086
All right,
in the interest of keeping

17:01.120 --> 17:03.989
a good relationship
with the cops, I'll cooperate.

17:05.691 --> 17:09.728
Todd owed me money.
About $15,000.

17:09.762 --> 17:12.164
What does that add up to
with the vig, Chris?

17:12.198 --> 17:16.434
It's not like that. I lend
money to people the banks won't.

17:16.469 --> 17:18.837
A gangster with a heart of gold.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.138
You don't put money on the street
without a collection plan.

17:21.174 --> 17:23.275
That's true. It's very true.

17:23.309 --> 17:26.178
But there's a big difference
between scaring someone

17:26.212 --> 17:27.746
and killing them.

17:29.182 --> 17:32.717
- Dead people don't pay their debts.
- Where were you last night?

17:32.752 --> 17:36.221
At home with my wife.
[Knock on door]

17:42.128 --> 17:44.162
Read it. Out loud.

17:46.032 --> 17:49.134
In the interest of keeping a
good relationship with the cops.

17:57.910 --> 18:01.379
"No, I'm not going to shut up

18:01.414 --> 18:04.382
and I'm not forgiving anything."

18:04.417 --> 18:07.018
Would you read the last line
louder, please?

18:07.053 --> 18:10.789
<i> I'm not forgiving anything.</i>

18:12.758 --> 18:15.026
You recognize his voice, Logan?

18:18.798 --> 18:23.268
Hey.

18:23.302 --> 18:26.338
We have to do this the right way.
Okay?

18:26.372 --> 18:29.040
<i>We have to make sure
it's the truth.</i>

18:30.443 --> 18:32.077
[Sighs]

18:32.111 --> 18:34.913
- It's not him.
- [Whispers] Okay.

18:43.192 --> 18:47.495
And the saleswoman loves her
and she has interesting taste.

18:47.529 --> 18:48.896
I mean, take this dress,
for instance.

18:48.931 --> 18:51.766
I might never have chosen it
because of the flare.

18:51.800 --> 18:53.901
Well, I think you should
cancel your credit cards

18:53.936 --> 18:55.636
and report this to the police,

18:55.671 --> 18:57.071
which should be easy given
this building is full of them.

18:57.106 --> 18:58.840
Not yet.
[Sighs deeply]

18:58.874 --> 19:01.042
You know, I have been interested
in the imposter phenomenon

19:01.076 --> 19:03.044
since that paper by Clance and Imes.

19:03.078 --> 19:04.979
It's fascinating
how it manifests itself

19:05.013 --> 19:06.714
in high achieving women.

19:06.749 --> 19:08.282
Well, I think the imposter
has an interest

19:08.317 --> 19:09.984
in your high credit limit.

19:10.018 --> 19:11.619
And more than likely, she is convinced

19:11.653 --> 19:13.821
that she is not worthy
of her accomplishments.

19:13.856 --> 19:16.090
But I am not sure why
she'd want to be me.

19:16.125 --> 19:18.893
- To steal your money.
- Well, of course I know that,

19:18.927 --> 19:21.796
but I do have a chance
to observe her up close.

19:21.830 --> 19:24.766
Wait, what do you mean you have
a chance to observe her up close?

19:24.800 --> 19:26.200
You're not thinking of doing
something crazy, are you?

19:26.235 --> 19:27.835
Well, she made a reservation
on my credit card

19:27.870 --> 19:29.637
for the Newbury for tomorrow.

19:29.671 --> 19:33.541
- Dr. Isles, I... [sighs]
- I'm only going to observe her.

19:33.575 --> 19:34.909
I'm gonna listen in
on her conversations

19:34.943 --> 19:36.944
and see what makes her tick.

19:36.979 --> 19:39.547
- Now take a look at this.
- Hmm?

19:39.581 --> 19:42.850
There's blood spatter on the grille
of Todd's car, but not on the hood.

19:42.885 --> 19:45.820
Well, the void could be
from the killer's body.

19:45.854 --> 19:48.956
Did you tell Detective Rizzoli
about this identify thief?

19:48.991 --> 19:52.226
Oh. No, not yet.
Because once I tell her,

19:52.261 --> 19:53.828
she's gonna get all
detective-y... [sighs]

19:53.862 --> 19:55.563
and then I won't be able
to observe the imposter

19:55.597 --> 19:58.332
- in its natural habitat.
- She's not a gorilla in the Congo.

19:58.367 --> 20:01.235
I mean, that actually sounds safer
than what you're talking about.

20:01.270 --> 20:02.970
I promise not to make contact.

20:03.005 --> 20:05.273
[Scoffs]
Besides, I'm bringing backup.

20:05.307 --> 20:07.792
Now let's go take a look at Todd's car.

20:15.384 --> 20:18.953
Chris Alexander's wife said
he was with her all night long.

20:18.987 --> 20:21.722
I don't necessarily believe her,
but I believe Logan Reynolds.

20:21.757 --> 20:22.990
Uh-huh.

20:23.025 --> 20:24.225
- Sergeant Korsak?
- Yeah?

20:24.259 --> 20:27.061
A Detective Guthrie from Camden.

20:27.095 --> 20:28.763
- Maine?
- Yes, sir. Maine.

20:28.797 --> 20:32.733
- He called about your N.C.I.C. request.
- What's he got for us?

20:32.768 --> 20:33.768
All he said was he'll be
traveling down here tomorrow,

20:33.802 --> 20:35.136
wants to come by.

20:36.939 --> 20:38.272
I hope this isn't someone using a case

20:38.307 --> 20:40.675
to get some good Italian
food in the big city.

20:40.709 --> 20:43.744
I have traveled for less.

20:43.779 --> 20:46.781
[Car engine idling]

20:50.018 --> 20:51.786
Hello.

20:51.820 --> 20:54.956
There is blood spatter
on the underside the hood.

20:54.990 --> 20:57.291
Which means Todd was attacked

20:57.326 --> 20:59.060
while he was checking the engine.

20:59.094 --> 21:00.361
Why would he do that?
The car started at the crime scene.

21:00.395 --> 21:01.963
Yes, and when we found

21:01.997 --> 21:03.664
that all systems were
in perfect working order,

21:03.699 --> 21:05.066
I developed a theory.

21:10.706 --> 21:13.007
Are you going to share that theory?

21:13.041 --> 21:16.210
In a moment. I'm waiting.

21:19.381 --> 21:21.949
This is not the dress
you wore to work this morning.

21:21.984 --> 21:24.952
[Engine sputtering] That is an interesting
story that I'm sure Dr. Isles ...

21:24.987 --> 21:28.624
Would be very happy
to share my theory with you.

21:40.469 --> 21:42.270
This is my theory.

21:42.304 --> 21:46.173
The suction from the fuel pump
pulled the sock over the filter.

21:46.208 --> 21:48.376
Which blocked the gas to
the engine and stalled the car.

21:48.410 --> 21:49.877
Exactly.

21:50.512 --> 21:53.014
So Todd's car was sabotaged.

21:59.821 --> 22:02.223
Well, it could've been put
in his tank when he was at work

22:02.257 --> 22:03.991
or when he stopped at the store.

22:04.026 --> 22:06.460
Either way, all the killer
had to do was follow him home

22:06.495 --> 22:08.930
- and wait for the car to stall out.
- That's right.

22:08.964 --> 22:10.331
I'm gonna have Nina pull up
security videos

22:10.365 --> 22:12.700
from Todd's work and the store.

22:12.734 --> 22:14.702
Maybe we can get a look
at whoever did it.

22:14.736 --> 22:16.947
- Okay.
- We have any idea on motive?

22:16.982 --> 22:20.074
- No, nothing yet.
- Oh. [Sighs]

22:20.108 --> 22:24.078
Come on, the Black Bears haven't
won a conference title since 2004.

22:24.112 --> 22:26.714
Hey, they took B.C., B.U.,
and U.N.H. last season.

22:26.748 --> 22:28.182
Their time is coming.

22:28.216 --> 22:30.184
Yeah, but they still gotta
get past Northeastern.

22:30.218 --> 22:34.188
Detective Rizzoli, this is the
detective from Camden, Maine.

22:34.222 --> 22:35.890
- Mike Guthrie.
- Right. Yeah.

22:35.924 --> 22:37.358
Thanks for coming.
I'm Jane Rizzoli.

22:37.392 --> 22:39.587
What do you got for us?

22:40.162 --> 22:44.732
- Who the hell gave you my evidence?
- It's not. It's mine.

22:44.766 --> 22:47.085
We're hunting the same killer.

22:54.540 --> 22:56.575
My first case as a detective.

22:56.609 --> 22:59.544
Ruth Simons, late 60s,
was found beaten to death

22:59.579 --> 23:01.146
on the side of a pretty desolate road.

23:01.180 --> 23:03.181
Aren't all roads in Maine desolate?

23:03.215 --> 23:05.016
[Chuckles] Only the ones
that go through the towns.

23:05.051 --> 23:06.585
[Chuckles]

23:06.619 --> 23:09.321
Looked like she pulled over,
got out, and was attacked.

23:09.355 --> 23:12.390
- Robbery?
- No. We ruled it out at the crime scene.

23:12.425 --> 23:13.592
Her pocketbook, money...

23:13.626 --> 23:15.360
hell, even her groceries
weren't touched.

23:15.394 --> 23:18.930
- Where'd she do her shopping?
- All day market.

23:18.965 --> 23:21.600
That's the same chain
that's in our case.

23:21.634 --> 23:23.418
[Sighs deeply] Didn't
make sense that she'd

23:23.419 --> 23:25.203
stop in such a remote
place, so I kept looking...

23:25.237 --> 23:28.707
Till I found this in the gas tank.

23:30.109 --> 23:31.343
Random nutholder?

23:31.377 --> 23:33.244
- Yep.
- Our crime lab guys

23:33.279 --> 23:35.380
took a look at the sock
and the handkerchief.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.482
They came up empty on any D.N.A.

23:37.516 --> 23:41.119
I know this might
be asking a lot, but...

23:41.153 --> 23:44.222
your crime lab is way more
advanced than ours. So...

23:44.256 --> 23:48.159
- Could you get them to retest this stuff?
- Uh, yeah.

23:48.194 --> 23:49.594
Frankie, can you take this stuff
down to the crime lab?

23:49.629 --> 23:51.262
Maybe they can get started on it?

23:51.297 --> 23:53.298
- Sure thing.
- Thank you.

23:57.069 --> 23:59.704
This is the most optimistic
I've been in two years.

23:59.739 --> 24:02.507
Before I head back to the hotel,
I just wanted to say thank you.

24:02.541 --> 24:06.144
Yeah. You're welcome.
And thank you.

24:08.547 --> 24:12.517
Did the handkerchief in your case
have a "V" cut into one side?

24:12.551 --> 24:14.452
I don't know. 
But our criminalists are the best.

24:14.487 --> 24:16.488
If it's there, they'll find it.

24:16.522 --> 24:19.057
[Yawns] Man, I've been driving
like a madman for hours.

24:19.091 --> 24:20.392
I need coffee.
[Elevator bell dings]

24:20.426 --> 24:22.694
The Division One Cafщ
is on the first floor.

24:22.728 --> 24:26.464
Coffee's not good,
but it's cheap and it's hot.

24:32.805 --> 24:35.106
Oh, my god.
I've heard of this place,

24:35.141 --> 24:38.410
but I never thought I'd
actually eat here. [Chuckles]

24:38.444 --> 24:42.347
This is so much better than going
to the Galубpagos Islands.

24:42.381 --> 24:45.316
Well, I'm not sure that's true,
but I'm glad you're here.

24:45.351 --> 24:49.287
Hello.
Has Dr. Isles arrived yet?

24:49.321 --> 24:51.723
Are you part of her group?

24:53.592 --> 24:54.793
Aren't we lucky?

24:54.827 --> 24:56.795
[Chuckles]
Everyone's at the bar.

25:02.101 --> 25:03.802
[Laughter]

25:03.836 --> 25:05.570
[Whispering] That's her.

25:05.604 --> 25:07.439
Of course she's in <i>couture.</i>

25:09.642 --> 25:12.177
Oh! No, no.
I need you as my cover.

25:12.211 --> 25:14.212
Oh. Okay.

25:14.246 --> 25:16.214
I wanna document her on a video.

25:16.248 --> 25:17.782
[Sighs deeply]

25:17.817 --> 25:20.185
[Women laugh]

25:20.219 --> 25:23.722
- Well, I guess she's funny.
- I'm funny.

25:23.756 --> 25:27.358
Of course you are, Maura.
Why don't we call Jane now?

25:27.393 --> 25:28.727
No. No.

25:28.761 --> 25:30.195
Then my observations
of the imposter phenomenon

25:30.229 --> 25:35.734
would be incomplete. Just...
let me get a little bit closer.

25:35.768 --> 25:37.602
Okay, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa.

25:37.636 --> 25:40.538
Didn't you say
that the imposter phenomenon

25:40.573 --> 25:44.642
manifests itself
in high-achieving women?

25:44.677 --> 25:46.077
- Yes.
- Okay.

25:46.112 --> 25:48.146
That is no high-achieving woman.

25:48.180 --> 25:49.547
That's some con artist

25:49.582 --> 25:53.151
who happened to have
your credit card number.

25:53.185 --> 25:56.087
<i>[Whispers] Sit.</i>

25:56.122 --> 25:58.323
<i>Sit.</i>

25:58.357 --> 26:00.558
[Exhales deeply]

26:00.593 --> 26:02.093
[Exhales deeply]

26:02.128 --> 26:04.462
This field trip
is not just to observe

26:04.497 --> 26:08.366
- the imposter phenomenon.
- What?

26:08.400 --> 26:09.501
[Sighs deeply]

26:09.535 --> 26:11.569
Well, what else is it?

26:11.604 --> 26:13.805
When I saw her selections
at the boutique,

26:13.839 --> 26:16.341
I-I reviewed my credit card statement.

26:16.375 --> 26:20.545
She made a spa and yoga combo
I never would've thought of.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.147
She's here at the Newbury,

26:22.181 --> 26:25.116
a place I've always wanted to go
and I never have.

26:25.151 --> 26:30.622
- She is living my life better than I am.
- Maura, she's a paper doll.

26:30.656 --> 26:34.826
<i>She hung a beautiful dress on herself,</i>

26:34.860 --> 26:36.694
she added a fabulous pair of shoes,

26:36.729 --> 26:39.464
but none of it makes her you.

26:39.498 --> 26:43.535
She's not smarter or better
than you, Maura.

26:43.569 --> 26:48.773
You've earned the respect and the
love from all the people in your life.

26:50.709 --> 26:53.778
What's better than that?
[Sighs]

26:53.813 --> 26:56.614
Thank you.
Thank you, Angela.

26:56.649 --> 26:57.916
<i>Aah!</i>

26:57.950 --> 27:00.218
<i>Help!
Someone, please help me!</i>

27:00.252 --> 27:01.586
Woman: Oh, god!
[Guests murmuring]

27:01.620 --> 27:03.555
Call 9-1-1. I'm a doctor.

27:03.589 --> 27:05.290
<i>Man: We need your help.</i>

27:05.324 --> 27:07.692
Okay, let's get him down
to the ground. Move him gently.

27:09.929 --> 27:15.200
- It's the emergency medical service.
- This is Dr. Maura isles.

27:15.234 --> 27:17.468
I've got an adult male,
approximately 65 years old,

27:17.503 --> 27:20.338
in sudden cardiac arrest.
I'm initiating C.P.R.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.542
[mouths word]
[cell phone beeps]

27:35.120 --> 27:39.290
I understand why Guthrie's
so desperate for help.

27:39.325 --> 27:41.860
He's got nothing.
Feels like we got nothing!

27:41.894 --> 27:44.229
Well, we didn't get anything
from the security video.

27:44.263 --> 27:46.514
I'll check with all day
market, see if any of

27:46.515 --> 27:48.766
their employees transferred
from Maine to Boston.

27:48.801 --> 27:50.668
Maybe the store is
the common denominator.

27:50.703 --> 27:52.503
Okay.

27:54.773 --> 27:58.977
Oh, hello. How was your
field trip with my mother?

27:59.011 --> 28:02.580
- Are the gorillas all right?
- Susie confessed to me

28:02.615 --> 28:04.782
that she told you about
my identity theft.

28:04.817 --> 28:07.886
- Yes, she did.
- What's this?

28:07.920 --> 28:10.255
This is your incident report,
ready for you to sign.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.491
Maura, why didn't you tell me
about this?

28:13.525 --> 28:16.227
I just wanted to see who she was,

28:16.262 --> 28:19.764
maybe learn something
about myself before you...

28:19.798 --> 28:22.367
Got all detective-y?

28:22.401 --> 28:24.736
I just knew you would not
approve of my field trip.

28:24.770 --> 28:26.471
I do not approve,

28:26.505 --> 28:27.906
and not just because I'm a cop,
because I'm your friend.

28:27.940 --> 28:30.875
- What you did could've been dangerous.
- I took your mother.

28:30.910 --> 28:33.170
Which is dangerous in it's own way.

28:33.879 --> 28:36.781
Did you get a look
at this fake Dr. Isles?

28:36.815 --> 28:40.285
No. I was too busy being
the real Dr. Isles.

28:44.523 --> 28:47.474
Aren't you concerned about
cross contamination?

28:48.560 --> 28:50.295
It's just they're both
on the same table, and ...

28:50.329 --> 28:52.964
Oh, no, I already swabbed both
the handkerchiefs for D.N.A.

28:52.998 --> 28:55.867
This is just the comparison examination.

28:55.901 --> 28:57.368
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

28:57.403 --> 29:00.838
- So are they the same?
- Uh, well, I can tell you that

29:00.873 --> 29:04.309
<i>the Boston handkerchief does not
have a notch cut in its side.</i>

29:04.343 --> 29:07.578
Even I can see that.

29:07.613 --> 29:09.747
What about the material?
Is that the same?

29:09.782 --> 29:14.419
Well, the maine handkerchief is
made up of 100% cotton fibers.

29:14.453 --> 29:15.954
- Uh-huh.
- The same as ours.

29:15.988 --> 29:20.959
Uh, the thread count is 160.
It's a pretty low-end hanky.

29:20.993 --> 29:23.561
But I don't see any evidence
of organic materials

29:23.595 --> 29:26.464
or discoloration that would
indicate the presence of blood.

29:26.498 --> 29:27.999
Now that being said...

29:29.935 --> 29:34.405
- I've removed a small sample...
- Yeah.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.307
to examine for the
presence of saliva ...

29:36.342 --> 29:37.809
[Fire alarm blaring, bell ringing]

29:37.843 --> 29:39.777
Ohh. 
What the hell's going on?

29:39.812 --> 29:40.979
[Sprinklers hiss]

29:41.013 --> 29:42.747
- Ah! Okay!
- Oh, no! Frankie!

29:42.781 --> 29:44.882
- Got it! Yeah!
- Oh, my god.

29:44.917 --> 29:46.551
Oh, no.

29:46.585 --> 29:47.952
[Blaring and ringing continues]

29:47.987 --> 29:50.588
[Groans]

29:58.528 --> 30:01.496
Susie: We did our best to try
to protect the evidence,

30:01.531 --> 30:05.534
- but there was just so much water.
- Does water destroy D.N.A.?

30:05.568 --> 30:08.937
- No. Worse. It washes it away.
- So you're telling me

30:08.972 --> 30:10.572
that everything the water
touched is contaminated?

30:10.607 --> 30:13.159
Even if there was D.N.A.
on this, we wouldn't be able

30:13.160 --> 30:15.711
to prove that is didn't wash
onto it from somewhere else.

30:15.745 --> 30:17.512
I-I'd hate to be the one
to tell Guthrie that

30:17.547 --> 30:19.615
two years of his work went
down the drain ... literally.

30:21.217 --> 30:24.219
- Oh, wow.
- Larry, what happened?

30:24.254 --> 30:27.055
- There was a fire in the men's room.
- In the men's room?

30:27.090 --> 30:30.058
Small trash can fire.
Somebody sneaking a cigarette.

30:30.093 --> 30:36.565
System extinguished it in 15 seconds.
I'm so sorry, Dr. Isles.

30:38.234 --> 30:41.270
I mean, what kinda idiot smokes
a cigarette in the bathroom?

30:41.304 --> 30:44.573
That's a really good question, Larry.

30:49.345 --> 30:53.582
I can't believe some dumb-ass threw
a lit cigarette in the trash can.

30:54.784 --> 30:57.586
They didn't. Look at this.
Nobody smoked this cigarette.

30:57.620 --> 31:00.856
They just used it to start the fire.

31:02.825 --> 31:06.929
There has been a development
in the evidence.

31:06.963 --> 31:10.832
- You were able to find something?
- Not exactly. Um...

31:10.867 --> 31:13.302
I'm sure you've noticed all the
commotion going on out there.

31:13.336 --> 31:14.970
Yeah. I thought that was
a fire alarm test.

31:15.004 --> 31:18.674
- Didn't seem to last 10 seconds.
- 15 seconds exactly.

31:18.708 --> 31:22.978
Um, there was a small fire
in the men's room downstairs.

31:23.012 --> 31:24.179
Oh. I hope no one was hurt.

31:24.213 --> 31:27.749
No. No, no one was hurt.
Um...

31:27.784 --> 31:31.687
but the alarms did set off
the sprinklers in the lab

31:31.721 --> 31:33.288
while we were testing
both handkerchiefs.

31:33.323 --> 31:36.158
[Sighs deeply]

31:36.192 --> 31:39.027
The evidence is ruined.
[Sighs deeply]

31:39.062 --> 31:41.063
I can't believe this.
Damn it.

31:41.097 --> 31:43.999
This whole case has been
one roadblock after another.

31:44.033 --> 31:46.935
- I am so sorry.
- I guess it's time I went back to maine.

31:46.970 --> 31:48.603
Maybe it's time
to put this case behind me.

31:48.638 --> 31:51.907
- I understand, but ...
- Ooh! What the hell?!

31:51.941 --> 31:55.043
- I-I-I am so sorry.
- What's wrong with you?

31:55.078 --> 31:56.712
- What's wrong with your whole department?
- I know.

31:56.746 --> 31:59.648
I, um...please, at least
let me pay to get those cleaned.

31:59.682 --> 32:01.149
It ... It's the least I can do.

32:01.184 --> 32:02.951
You think that's gonna
make right what you've done?

32:02.986 --> 32:07.155
It doesn't.
It doesn't fix anything.

32:07.190 --> 32:09.057
<i> Please, at least let me pay
to get those cleaned.</i>

32:09.092 --> 32:10.892
<i>It ... it's the least I can do.</i>

32:10.927 --> 32:12.394
<i> You think that's gonna
make right what you've done?</i>

32:12.428 --> 32:16.098
<i> It doesn't.
It doesn't fix anything.</i>

32:16.132 --> 32:18.700
[Exhales deeply]

32:18.735 --> 32:20.202
That's him.

32:25.708 --> 32:27.042
<i>Hey.</i>

32:27.076 --> 32:28.643
Logan just I.D.ed Guthrie's voice

32:28.678 --> 32:30.078
as the guy he heard arguing
with his father.

32:30.113 --> 32:31.847
Now that's not enough
to put him away, but...

32:31.881 --> 32:34.950
Well, I just found the connection
between Todd and Mike Guthrie.

32:34.984 --> 32:37.819
They went to summer camp
together 25 years ago.

32:37.854 --> 32:39.421
So Todd shows up on his porch
yelling and screaming

32:39.455 --> 32:41.990
'cause he lost a badminton game
25 years ago?

32:42.025 --> 32:43.392
There was a reunion two weeks ago.

32:43.426 --> 32:45.193
I tracked down one of
the campers who was there.

32:45.228 --> 32:48.797
Apparently that summer, Guthrie
was teased by his cabinmates.

32:48.831 --> 32:50.932
Well, everybody gets teased at camp.

32:50.967 --> 32:54.002
Yeah, but Guthrie was a bed wetter.

32:54.037 --> 32:56.238
This guy said the teasing
was pretty vicious.

32:56.272 --> 32:58.607
Then let me guess ...
Todd Reynolds was

32:58.608 --> 33:01.176
- the leader of the pack.
- You got it.

33:01.210 --> 33:02.310
Guthrie was so miserable that
he had to call his stepfather

33:02.345 --> 33:03.712
to come take him home.

33:03.746 --> 33:06.415
When the stepfather got there,
he decided to teach Guthrie a lesson.

33:06.449 --> 33:08.984
He spanked the poor kid
in front of the entire camp.

33:09.018 --> 33:11.086
- What?!
- After something like that?

33:11.120 --> 33:13.188
It's possible
Guthrie reorganized his life

33:13.222 --> 33:15.857
so that he could never
be humiliated again.

33:15.892 --> 33:18.093
[Grunts] And you and I both
know cops who got the badge

33:18.127 --> 33:19.961
just so nobody could
push them around anymore.

33:19.996 --> 33:21.263
[Blows air]
More than a few.

33:21.297 --> 33:24.099
So what? The ...
The reunion set him off?

33:24.133 --> 33:26.968
Maura said a guy like Guthrie,

33:27.003 --> 33:28.937
"someone who was humiliated
and left powerless

33:28.971 --> 33:32.808
by an abusive stepfather
would have repressed his anger."

33:32.842 --> 33:35.744
Until the reunion triggers an explosion.

33:35.778 --> 33:38.780
So why not fight right there?
Why wait two weeks?

33:38.815 --> 33:41.850
Guthrie didn't go.
But at the reunion, Todd told my guy

33:41.884 --> 33:43.785
that he felt guilty about the teasings,

33:43.820 --> 33:45.087
said he wanted to make things right.

33:45.121 --> 33:48.156
Well, maybe he reached out to
Guthrie, and that's what lit the fuse.

33:48.191 --> 33:50.892
If that's so, we need to track
down all these cabinmates.

33:50.927 --> 33:53.128
If he's been repressing anger
for 25 years,

33:53.162 --> 33:54.763
he may be just getting started.

34:06.490 --> 34:08.976
I located Guthrie's
other four cabin buddies

34:08.976 --> 34:10.060
from camp 25 years ago.

34:10.094 --> 34:13.429
Braintree, Marshfield,
Wareham, and New Bedford.

34:13.464 --> 34:15.598
How about Frankie?
Is he still trailing Guthrie?

34:15.632 --> 34:17.000
As far as I know.

34:17.034 --> 34:18.601
I'm tracking Frankie's
cell phone G.P.S. signal.

34:18.636 --> 34:20.704
That's him there.
Going North of the city.

34:20.737 --> 34:23.739
Yeah, you're right, and all the other
cabin buddies live South of the city.

34:23.774 --> 34:25.475
You think Guthrie's going
back home to Maine?

34:25.509 --> 34:26.710
Could be.
Maybe all he wanted to do

34:26.744 --> 34:28.445
was destroy the evidence against him.

34:28.478 --> 34:29.879
They're getting off the highway.

34:29.914 --> 34:31.915
Get Frankie on the phone, would you?

34:33.851 --> 34:36.518
No service.
Must be in a dead zone.

34:36.554 --> 34:38.788
Where the hell is he going?

34:38.822 --> 34:40.422
You know, when I ran
Todd's phone records,

34:40.458 --> 34:42.359
there was a phone call
to a number North of Boston.

34:42.393 --> 34:43.659
Who was it to?

34:43.694 --> 34:45.829
Dana Slowey,
2012 Trent Avenue, Revere.

34:45.862 --> 34:47.664
Any calls between Slowey and Guthrie?

34:47.697 --> 34:50.833
Quite a few calls between them,
mostly from Dana to Guthrie.

34:50.868 --> 34:53.503
The last one was minutes after
Todd called Dana.

34:53.536 --> 34:58.575
Wow. 13 domestic assault
and battery charges.

34:58.609 --> 35:00.677
Three claims of child endangerment.

35:00.711 --> 35:04.047
Lost his driver's license after
his fifth drunk driving conviction.

35:04.081 --> 35:07.751
- This guy's a beauty.
- Do you think we found the stepfather?

35:07.785 --> 35:10.387
Given the story I heard about
the stepfather showing up at camp

35:10.421 --> 35:12.455
and making the kid's life worse,

35:12.490 --> 35:14.557
I'm guessing
that's Guthrie's stepfather.

35:14.592 --> 35:17.060
I guess Guthrie finally realized

35:17.094 --> 35:20.430
killing the other campers wasn't
gonna solve his real problem.

35:21.832 --> 35:23.829
I'm gonna call Jane
and have her meet me at the car.

35:23.864 --> 35:26.860
If you get through to Frankie,
bring him up to speed, would you?

35:38.682 --> 35:40.950
[Cell phone rings]

35:40.985 --> 35:44.754
- It's Frankie. Yeah?
- He's been sitting here for 45 minutes.

35:44.789 --> 35:46.656
<i>- Any idea why he's waiting?
- Jane: No, but keep your eyes peeled.</i>

35:46.690 --> 35:49.092
<i>The stepfather lives two blocks away.</i>

35:49.126 --> 35:50.994
Shouldn't we
take him down now, then?

35:51.028 --> 35:52.495
All right, you got three kids
coming through.

35:52.530 --> 35:54.097
You wait till they get past
to make a move.

35:54.131 --> 35:56.199
I can't believe we didn't check
this guy's story.

35:56.233 --> 35:57.734
It wouldn't have done much good.

35:57.768 --> 35:59.702
I mean, Guthrie just added
a few phony details

35:59.737 --> 36:01.438
to one of his own cases.

36:01.472 --> 36:03.039
Besides, when's the last time
someone checked on us

36:03.073 --> 36:04.908
when we went into another jurisdiction?

36:04.942 --> 36:06.876
- Never.
- If that much.

36:12.950 --> 36:14.884
He's moving across the street.

36:17.054 --> 36:19.088
Shit. He was waiting on the bus.
Let's go and take him.

36:19.123 --> 36:20.256
[Tires peal]

36:24.528 --> 36:26.729
Freeze!

36:26.764 --> 36:29.098
[Brakes screech]

36:29.133 --> 36:31.100
Put it down, Mike!

36:31.135 --> 36:32.869
Hey, you know what?
Don't worry about it.

36:32.903 --> 36:36.773
He hasn't got the balls to shoot me.
Kid's always been a pussy.

36:36.807 --> 36:38.508
I am not a pussy.
I'm a cop!

36:38.542 --> 36:41.711
You're a cop? [Chuckles]
In Maine.

36:41.745 --> 36:43.913
Who's gonna hurt you there, huh?
A big moose?

36:43.948 --> 36:46.883
- Shut up!
- Oh, please don't shoot me, Mikey.

36:46.917 --> 36:48.651
<i>You think I'm scared of you?</i>

36:50.588 --> 36:51.888
Go ahead. Shoot him, Mike.

36:55.526 --> 36:57.594
Hey, come on.
You friggin' crazy?

36:57.628 --> 37:01.200
Yeah. Shoot him.

37:01.765 --> 37:04.534
He deserves it.

37:06.103 --> 37:08.638
[Holsters gun]
You were just mad at Todd.

37:08.672 --> 37:12.930
But this guy?
This guy deserves it. Shoot him.

37:13.878 --> 37:15.044
Korsak, Frankie ...
they won't say a thing.

37:15.079 --> 37:16.546
- Not me.
- Dana: Hey, come on.

37:18.182 --> 37:19.849
Knock it off.

37:19.884 --> 37:24.474
He did nothing but bully
and hurt you your entire life.

37:25.589 --> 37:29.259
Anybody would understand
if you did it. Okay?

37:30.961 --> 37:32.929
I'd understand.

37:32.963 --> 37:35.064
[Voice breaks]
Why couldn't I kill him?

37:35.099 --> 37:37.567
[Handcuffs click]
What'd I tell ya?

37:37.601 --> 37:39.936
He's a pussy. You let a girl
take a gun from you?

37:39.970 --> 37:42.510
Man, shut up or I'll shoot you myself!

37:42.545 --> 37:43.630
Frankie: Let's go.

37:43.665 --> 37:45.837
- You wouldn't say anything, right?
- Not a word.

37:54.018 --> 37:56.185
<i>It was right after I told him</i>

37:56.220 --> 38:01.558
that you caught the man who...
killed Todd.

38:01.592 --> 38:06.696
He said he had a question for you.
He won't tell em what it is.

38:06.730 --> 38:11.568
- He ... He said it was personal.
- It's okay.

38:11.602 --> 38:14.922
Thank you, by the way, for...

38:16.040 --> 38:18.474
You're welcome.

38:21.278 --> 38:23.146
[Sighs deeply]

38:24.682 --> 38:25.949
Hey, bud.

38:27.251 --> 38:29.385
Your mom said you have
a question for me.

38:34.158 --> 38:36.826
Is this yours?

38:36.860 --> 38:40.730
No. It belonged to a friend of mine.

38:42.070 --> 38:44.148
Does he play with it?

38:46.770 --> 38:49.272
Not anymore.

38:52.276 --> 38:54.344
[Sighs]

38:54.378 --> 38:58.114
If I'd told my mom about
the man coming to our house,

38:58.148 --> 39:00.958
would my dad be alive today?

39:05.322 --> 39:08.257
Listen to me.

39:08.292 --> 39:12.762
Nothing you did caused
your father's death. Okay?

39:12.796 --> 39:16.099
And there is nothing you could've
done that would've stopped it.

39:16.133 --> 39:20.303
But you did help us find
the man who did it.

39:20.337 --> 39:22.839
And I know that your father
would be very...

39:22.873 --> 39:24.907
[Whispers] very proud of you
for that.

39:34.151 --> 39:36.739
<i>[Singsongy] Hello?</i>

39:36.774 --> 39:38.755
Hey.
[Door closes]

39:40.090 --> 39:42.959
- Ta-da!
- What's this?

39:42.993 --> 39:47.363
This is the paperwork
on the phony Dr. Isles.

39:47.398 --> 39:49.666
She was arrested
earlier this evening.

39:49.700 --> 39:51.067
Oh, where was she?
At the spa?

39:51.101 --> 39:55.027
No, don't tell me.
She was at <i>La Manage.</i>

39:55.372 --> 39:57.006
She was actually, uh,

39:57.041 --> 40:01.377
trying to pass a stolen credit
card at Darlene's Wig shop.

40:01.412 --> 40:03.146
Um, believe it or not,

40:03.180 --> 40:07.350
she has a lengthy record of
scams and stolen I.D.s. so...

40:07.384 --> 40:10.637
I'm so sorry that I
romanticized her and probably

40:10.638 --> 40:13.890
cost some other unfortunate
person more misery.

40:13.924 --> 40:15.725
But how did you even know
who she was?

40:15.759 --> 40:19.862
- I never saw her face.
- Well, actually, uh...

40:19.897 --> 40:23.232
taking my mother as backup
was a really good idea.

40:23.267 --> 40:24.834
You know that
she wasn't gonna

40:24.868 --> 40:26.969
let this woman get away
with it scot-free. So...

40:27.004 --> 40:29.238
I actually can't believe
that she figured out

40:29.273 --> 40:30.907
how to use the camera on her phone.

40:30.941 --> 40:32.442
[Chuckles] Your mother is
very resourceful.

40:32.476 --> 40:35.912
Yes, she is.
And that picture made the case.

40:35.946 --> 40:39.415
The detectives were able to charge her
with a much more serious felony.

40:39.450 --> 40:41.818
Well, what's more serious than
identity theft? [Sets down papers]

40:41.852 --> 40:45.996
Making the chief medical examiner
question her life's work?

40:47.825 --> 40:51.928
Well, I think it's
just a shame that this woman

40:51.962 --> 40:54.464
can't use her powers for good.

40:54.498 --> 40:57.433
What, her powers to steal
other people's lives?

40:57.468 --> 40:59.068
No, not that.

40:59.103 --> 41:02.305
You know, her gift for
accessorizing, for juxtaposition.

41:02.339 --> 41:05.108
That spa and yoga combo
was brilliant.

41:05.142 --> 41:07.276
It was brilliant.

41:07.311 --> 41:09.045
You could be brilliant, too,
if you'd just become

41:09.079 --> 41:11.273
a ne'er-do-well con woman.

41:12.867 --> 41:16.143
- What's that?
- My imposter ordered some

41:16.317 --> 41:18.987
fine French wine
that she never picked up.

41:19.341 --> 41:21.822
Well, wasn't she either gift
that keeps on giving? {*}

41:22.414 --> 41:24.941
Yay. Alright, 
but I would like to chef's

41:24.942 --> 41:27.469
depose this wine with a pizza.

41:27.632 --> 41:30.791
Well actually, it'd be more
accurate to accessorize.

41:31.423 --> 41:33.619
Stop crackin' me. 
Eat the pizza! [laughs]

41:33.769 --> 41:38.040
Here... what if I'll give you
the pizza-earrings?
