Yes. So all I need now is the right
piece of wood to carve it from!

-Like this?
-No.

06:13.479 --> 06:17.120
I need wood from the same tree
I made the others from

so they'll fit together. But don't worry.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.120
We can find that wood pile easily

Hmm. Can't remember where we left it.

08:07.599 --> 08:11.479
It's gotta be in this
vroom-vroom pile somewhere...

08:11.880 --> 08:14.919
Oh. There! Found it!

08:15.080 --> 08:17.919
Oh, no! It got wrecked
in your vroom-vroom pile.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.200

08:20.359 --> 08:22.640
we'll never find our way back to Sasha's!

08:22.840 --> 08:24.919
And those cookies made me really thirsty.

08:25.239 --> 08:28.039
I don't have any water, do you?

08:29.599 --> 08:32.319
We're doomed!

08:32.640 --> 08:34.720
Maybe not, Ollie. Look!

08:34.880 --> 08:37.799
We've got a snowball maker
and a hairdryer!

08:37.959 --> 08:39.360
Maybe a forest animal

08:39.520 --> 08:42.039
would trade us some maps
and water for them?

08:44.240 --> 08:46.240
Oh, who am I kidding, Ollie?

08:46.760 --> 08:49.360
I should've put all this stuff
away back at the apartment

08:49.520 --> 08:52.240
like you wanted me to. Then
I wouldn't have wrecked the map

08:52.400 --> 08:57.480
with this pile of piñatas
and toothpaste and world maps.

08:57.680 --> 08:59.680

-It's OK, Moon.

then my explorer canteen
full of water should be, too!
