00:05.339 --> 00:07.672
(tires screech)

00:07.674 --> 00:10.775
(sirens wailing)

00:15.481 --> 00:17.314
(tires screech)

00:19.618 --> 00:22.351
(tires screech)

00:24.621 --> 00:26.387
(sirens wailing)

00:26.389 --> 00:28.689
(tires screech)

00:30.059 --> 00:33.326
Driver! Out of your vehicle now!

00:33.328 --> 00:35.528
I said out
of the vehicle!

00:39.700 --> 00:42.734
(car alarms wailing)

01:20.273 --> 01:23.340
Nothing rachel said
was true, was it?

01:24.276 --> 01:25.275
No.

01:25.277 --> 01:27.110
Her name even rachel?

01:29.581 --> 01:31.647
So what happens now?

01:31.649 --> 01:33.649
You go
to jail.

01:33.651 --> 01:35.717
Sam:
Let's go, loverboy.

01:44.760 --> 01:47.326
Keep it
movin'.

01:49.596 --> 01:51.295
He's all yours.

01:51.297 --> 01:54.531
Everything I said
to you, I meant it.

01:54.533 --> 01:57.534
Everything
was real.

01:57.536 --> 01:59.235
Not for me.

02:03.607 --> 02:05.340
You good?

02:05.342 --> 02:07.709
I'm great.

02:07.711 --> 02:10.812
Mmm. Man fell hard
for you.

02:10.814 --> 02:13.614
The man was also funding
domestic terrorism.

02:13.616 --> 02:16.350
And plus, you know what,
the-the whole billionaire thing,

02:16.352 --> 02:19.186
Kind of
getting old.
Mmm. I'm sure.

02:19.188 --> 02:21.121
You know, perfect
clothes, perfect car,

02:21.123 --> 02:22.655
Perfect food.
It's like, "ugh.

02:22.657 --> 02:24.657
Too much."
deeks:
Amen to that.

02:24.659 --> 02:26.125
I like things with flaws.

02:26.127 --> 02:27.626
Yeah, well,
that's no secret.

02:27.628 --> 02:28.827
Easy, tiger.

02:28.829 --> 02:30.762
(chuckles)
we've been grinding

02:30.764 --> 02:32.430
On this case
for two days straight.

02:32.432 --> 02:35.433
Time for some chow
and some shut-eye.

02:35.435 --> 02:36.634
Amen to that.

02:36.636 --> 02:38.636
Best idea ever.
Mmm.

02:38.638 --> 02:41.138
All right.
Well, I think I have to get
out of this dress.

02:41.140 --> 02:42.572
It makes me
nervous to wear it.

02:42.574 --> 02:44.740
He spent $3,000 on this dress.

02:44.742 --> 02:47.743
What? It sounds
like you're saying "$3,000."

02:47.745 --> 02:49.678
Mm-hmm. It's a balmain.

02:49.680 --> 02:51.479
You got to pay
to play, baby.

02:51.481 --> 02:53.614
We should take it to melrose,
hock it for a hundo.

02:53.616 --> 02:55.349
Ha, ha. Then you
can explain to hetty

02:55.351 --> 02:56.883
Why it never showed up
in wardrobe.

03:05.492 --> 03:07.558
(grunts, panting)

03:12.731 --> 03:13.930
(grunts)

03:13.932 --> 03:15.398
(moans)
whoa!

03:15.400 --> 03:16.298
Beale!

03:16.300 --> 03:17.632
Hey.

03:17.634 --> 03:19.767
I'm fine. I'm fine.

03:19.769 --> 03:20.834
What are you doing?

03:20.836 --> 03:24.737
Just, uh...
Practicing my training.

03:24.739 --> 03:26.839
Training? Training for what?

03:26.841 --> 03:28.841
I've been...
I've been doing jujitsu

03:28.843 --> 03:30.709
For the past, uh, month over

03:30.711 --> 03:32.711
At copper
academy.
Really?

03:32.713 --> 03:35.580
Wow. That's very impressive.

03:35.582 --> 03:37.848
Yeah. Well, I figured my firearm
training's coming along.

03:37.850 --> 03:41.318
Maybe it's time
for a little... Unarmed combat.

03:41.320 --> 03:44.954
All right. Well, let's see
your defense for this chokehold.

03:44.956 --> 03:47.222
(choking)
safe word. Safe word.

03:47.224 --> 03:49.224
Pretty sure you just say "tap."

03:49.226 --> 03:51.693
Oh. Yeah.

03:51.695 --> 03:53.828
Um, nell, I have a confession
to make.

03:53.830 --> 03:55.863
What's that?
I haven't
really...

03:55.865 --> 03:58.498
Learned any jujitsu yet.

03:58.500 --> 04:01.434
I thought you said you've been
training for over a month.
I have.

04:01.436 --> 04:03.769
And?
And, um,

04:03.771 --> 04:06.838
I haven't actually made it
to the class part yet.

04:06.840 --> 04:08.506
What do you mean?

04:08.508 --> 04:10.508
Um, I usually have to...

04:10.510 --> 04:13.677
Take a breather and lie down
during the warm-up.

04:13.679 --> 04:15.311
The warm-up?
Yeah.

04:15.313 --> 04:17.613
You may call it a warm-up.

04:17.614 --> 04:19.914
I call it navy seal hell week
crammed into 20 minutes.

04:19.917 --> 04:21.850
Oh, beale, it's not that bad.

04:21.852 --> 04:23.251
Not if
you're some

04:23.253 --> 04:26.587
Ripped, eight-pack,
adonis-looking stud.

04:26.589 --> 04:28.922
Okay.
How do you know it's not so bad?

04:28.924 --> 04:31.691
I just...

04:31.693 --> 04:34.060
Nell?

04:34.061 --> 04:36.428
I dated one of the instructors
over there.

04:36.431 --> 04:37.897
Huh.

04:37.899 --> 04:42.234
Look, it's been a long night.
Hetty's giving us the day.

04:42.236 --> 04:44.336
How 'bout we go get
some breakfast

04:44.337 --> 04:46.437
And talk
about literally anything else.

04:46.440 --> 04:47.972
Great.

04:47.974 --> 04:50.908
Let's go.
Great.

04:51.877 --> 04:53.877
So, this guy,

04:53.879 --> 04:56.479
Was he, like,
a full-on instructor or...
(groans)

04:57.782 --> 05:00.949
This açaí bowl, really good,
man. You should've gotten one.

05:00.951 --> 05:03.618
Easy.

05:03.619 --> 05:06.286
I'm already drinking
this baby food smoothie for you.

05:07.690 --> 05:08.955
What do you have
against açaí?

05:08.957 --> 05:11.958
It's the superfood
of the amazon.

05:11.960 --> 05:14.961
You don't think it's strange
that two years ago

05:14.963 --> 05:16.829
You'd never even heard
of açaí?

05:16.831 --> 05:18.730
Now you're slurping it down
every chance you get.

05:18.732 --> 05:20.732
I don't do that.
I don't slurp.

05:20.734 --> 05:24.635
I don't trust it. It's too new.

05:24.637 --> 05:27.638
You don't trust a fruit?
It's just the latest
l.A. Food craze, that's all.

05:27.640 --> 05:29.506
Today it's some mystery berry
from the amazon.

05:29.508 --> 05:31.508
Tomorrow we'll be eating...
Shower mold

05:31.510 --> 05:33.743
Because it's high in omega-3s.
It's ridiculous.

05:33.745 --> 05:35.745
Actually,
the new açaí

05:35.747 --> 05:38.748
Is a cactus fruit.
It's called pitaya.

05:38.750 --> 05:39.749
Pi-tay-a.
Pi-tay-a?

05:39.751 --> 05:41.016
Pi-tay-a.
Pit-ay-a.

05:41.018 --> 05:42.584
All right. Now you're
just making stuff up.

05:42.586 --> 05:44.385
That's ridiculous.
No... Hey!

05:44.387 --> 05:47.988
Hey!
Whoa,
man.

05:47.990 --> 05:51.992
(phone ringing)

05:51.994 --> 05:55.829
Man:
Morning, agent callen,

05:55.831 --> 05:58.398
Agent hanna.
Who's this?

05:58.400 --> 06:00.666
I'm glad you had
a nutritious breakfast.

06:00.668 --> 06:03.468
Vitamins, minerals.

06:03.470 --> 06:05.636
Healthy energy
for the day ahead.

06:05.638 --> 06:08.338
(indistinct chatter)

06:09.908 --> 06:11.908
It's been fun talking
to you, pal,

06:11.910 --> 06:13.910
But this conversation's
over...
Pressing that button,

06:13.912 --> 06:15.645
Agent callen,
will be like killing

06:15.647 --> 06:17.747
Those 20 people by yourself.

06:17.749 --> 06:19.815
20 people?

06:19.817 --> 06:22.350
Yes, agent hanna, 20 people.
I'm... You know, give or take.

06:22.352 --> 06:25.386
(chuckles) but what's a life
or two either way, right?

06:25.388 --> 06:28.655
Uh-huh.
This is some kind of a game?

06:28.657 --> 06:30.323
A game is played for pleasure.

06:30.325 --> 06:32.058
A game doesn't have
a determined outcome.

06:32.060 --> 06:33.726
Either side can win in a game.

06:33.728 --> 06:35.928
Games have their place.
But this...

06:35.930 --> 06:40.032
Whatever this is, boys,
it ain't a game.

06:40.034 --> 06:43.468
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.
Feetsies stay planted.

06:43.470 --> 06:47.939
If you hit send on that text,
agent hanna, the 20 people die.

06:47.941 --> 06:51.943
I want you two to throw
your earwigs and your phones

06:51.945 --> 06:55.012
Down that storm drain to
the right behind that planter.

06:55.014 --> 06:57.481
Now.

06:57.483 --> 06:59.483
You got ten seconds.

06:59.485 --> 07:02.686
Nine, eight,

07:02.688 --> 07:05.088
Seven, six,

07:05.090 --> 07:06.956
Five...

07:06.958 --> 07:08.757
What's keeping you?

07:08.759 --> 07:10.492
Four...

07:10.494 --> 07:12.694
Good choice.
(splashing)

07:12.696 --> 07:15.396
Now, I think I know the answer
to this but indulge me.

07:15.398 --> 07:17.998
Are you two willing
to trade your lives

07:18.000 --> 07:20.033
For those of 20 strangers?

07:20.035 --> 07:21.567
Yes.

07:21.569 --> 07:24.436
No wavering. No hesitation.

07:24.438 --> 07:26.104
How do we save them?

07:26.106 --> 07:27.905
Do you guys have a theme song?

07:27.907 --> 07:32.509
I mean, you should, 'cause this
is all really very heroic stuff.

07:32.511 --> 07:35.044
You got one minute
to save 20 people.

07:36.113 --> 07:37.779
It's a bomb.

07:37.781 --> 07:39.046
You're right about that.

07:39.048 --> 07:42.783
50 seconds.
Where is it?

07:42.785 --> 07:44.451
How many more times do you think

07:44.453 --> 07:45.952
That boy's gonna bounce
that basketball

07:45.954 --> 07:47.053
Before he dies?

07:49.057 --> 07:51.057
The bus stop.
Federal agents! There's a bomb!

07:51.059 --> 07:52.625
Clear the way! Get out
clear the bus stop!
Get out of here!

07:52.627 --> 07:53.626
Of the way!
There's a bomb, everybody!
Move, move,

07:53.628 --> 07:54.860
Move, move!
Go, go, go!

07:54.862 --> 07:56.795
Mama, what's happening?
What's happening?

07:56.797 --> 07:59.030
Sweetheart, come
with me. Right now.

07:59.032 --> 08:00.164
Just come
with me now.
Okay.

08:00.166 --> 08:01.865
Sam, the boy!

08:01.867 --> 08:04.033
I got him.

08:04.035 --> 08:05.134
(indistinct shouting)

08:06.103 --> 08:08.403
Three, two,

08:08.405 --> 08:09.971
One!

08:10.940 --> 08:12.439
(screaming)

08:14.943 --> 08:16.809
(car alarms wailing)

08:16.811 --> 08:19.812
You okay?
You okay?

08:19.814 --> 08:21.880
(phone ringing)
(indistinct shouting)

08:26.686 --> 08:28.152
Man:
Wow.

08:28.154 --> 08:31.455
Smart money said you'd lose
at least four of 'em.

08:31.457 --> 08:34.191
Color me impressed.
(sirens wailing in distance)

08:34.193 --> 08:37.594
Now it's time to get to work,
boys.

08:50.074 --> 08:52.874
So, I have this feeling
that I'm going to regret

08:52.876 --> 08:55.142
Letting you pick the breakfast
place this morning, but...
Something's wrong.

08:55.144 --> 08:58.478
I don't like this.
What's up? No little kid
monster cereal on the menu?

08:58.480 --> 09:00.480
Callen and sam's
phones went offline.

09:00.482 --> 09:03.483
Let me see that.
And no signal from
their earwigs either.

09:03.485 --> 09:06.586
Hmm. Maybe they're in an
underground parking structure.

09:06.588 --> 09:08.187
No. There's none near
their last known location.

09:08.189 --> 09:10.789
Why would they
ditch their comms?
Hmm.

09:10.791 --> 09:12.657
And at exactly
the same time.

09:12.659 --> 09:14.725
Come on.
Let's check it out.

09:15.961 --> 09:18.828
(sizzling)

09:23.234 --> 09:25.234
(whistles)
I will not lie--

09:25.236 --> 09:27.769
That dress is a work of art,

09:27.771 --> 09:31.239
But it is not even in
the same league as this t-shirt.

09:31.241 --> 09:33.608
Well, yeah, and that t-shirt
is actually much more,

09:33.610 --> 09:35.076
Uh...
Much more what?

09:35.078 --> 09:37.078
Much more you.
Aw, thank you.

09:37.080 --> 09:39.647
You ready for this?
Mm-hmm.

09:40.583 --> 09:43.250
Breakfast... Is served.

09:43.252 --> 09:45.252
I know it's not brunch
at the soho house,

09:45.254 --> 09:47.988
But it's gonna have to do.

09:47.990 --> 09:50.123
Don't tick... Don't tickle me.
Please don't tickle me.
Please don't tickle me.

09:51.259 --> 09:52.258
Mmm.
Get in there.

09:52.260 --> 09:53.759
Okay. Oh, thank you.

09:53.761 --> 09:57.762
Ah, I love your frittatas.
They are the best.

09:59.499 --> 10:01.565
Okay.

10:06.104 --> 10:09.572
Mmm. Just
perfect.

10:09.574 --> 10:11.640
Yeah.

10:16.680 --> 10:20.214
You're not still thinking
about my undercover op, are you?
No.

10:20.216 --> 10:23.150
Well, no, maybe. A little.

10:23.152 --> 10:25.585
Guy's a douche.

10:25.587 --> 10:26.586
Now he's a
douche in jail.

10:26.588 --> 10:27.787
I don't care about him.

10:27.789 --> 10:29.121
Well, good.
'cause you shouldn't.

10:29.123 --> 10:30.655
I was actually just thinking
about the fact

10:30.657 --> 10:33.124
That you spent the last week
in a world where...

10:33.126 --> 10:35.059
Money was no object.

10:35.061 --> 10:37.661
You know me.
I could care less

10:37.663 --> 10:39.663
About money, whether it be cars
or clothes or watches.

10:39.665 --> 10:41.531
I don't...
It doesn't matter to me.

10:41.533 --> 10:43.666
But?
(sighs)

10:43.668 --> 10:46.669
But, um...

10:46.671 --> 10:49.004
I don't know.
Sometimes I think,

10:49.006 --> 10:52.207
You know, maybe I want
to get those things for you.

10:52.209 --> 10:54.209
And,
listen,

10:54.211 --> 10:56.544
I-I love my job.
You know how much I love my job.

10:56.546 --> 10:59.013
But I realized this week
that I...

10:59.015 --> 11:02.082
I'm-I'm never gonna have
that kind of money.

11:03.051 --> 11:05.317
I'm here.

11:05.319 --> 11:06.819
With you.

11:06.820 --> 11:08.320
Yeah, no.
I know that you're here with me.

11:08.322 --> 11:11.156
I'm just saying that, you know,
and then...
And then

11:11.158 --> 11:12.757
Nothing.

11:12.759 --> 11:14.625
I've dated guys with money,
deeks.

11:14.627 --> 11:16.760
Lots of money. Like plane money.

11:16.762 --> 11:18.928
Plane money?
Like a cessna or like a...
It doesn't

11:18.930 --> 11:20.963
Matter.

11:20.965 --> 11:22.831
This is all
I've ever wanted,

11:22.833 --> 11:24.966
Deeks. Even before I met you,

11:24.968 --> 11:28.336
This is exactly how I wanted
to feel.

11:31.074 --> 11:33.741
I don't care
where I have breakfast.

11:33.743 --> 11:35.843
As long as you're there.

11:37.112 --> 11:39.178
Come here.

11:44.951 --> 11:46.684
What?

11:47.653 --> 11:49.953
I love that t-shirt.

11:49.955 --> 11:52.622
Me, too.

11:52.624 --> 11:55.324
(chuckles)

11:55.326 --> 11:57.659
(phones vibrating, ringing)

11:57.661 --> 11:59.127
I'm not gonna look
at that.

11:59.129 --> 12:01.796
Oh, I think
you should.

12:01.798 --> 12:04.131
Son of a...
Can you grab me some shoes?

12:04.133 --> 12:08.368
I'll put these
in the car.
Yeah. Mmm.

12:08.370 --> 12:12.038
And I quote: "take the day,
relax, because you earned it."

12:12.040 --> 12:14.040
What's going on?
Nothing good.

12:14.042 --> 12:16.175
This is
from an hour ago.

12:16.177 --> 12:18.243
(indistinct shouting)

12:20.380 --> 12:22.780
Okay.
What's...

12:22.782 --> 12:25.115
Wait for it.

12:31.889 --> 12:34.022
Oh. Are callen
and sam okay?
Where are they?

12:34.024 --> 12:36.357
Yes. And we don't know.

12:36.359 --> 12:37.958
Callen and sam
both ditched their comms

12:37.960 --> 12:39.693
Around the time
of the explosion.

12:39.695 --> 12:41.728
How did they know the bus stop
was gonna blow up?

12:41.730 --> 12:44.664
I found some additional footage
from before the explosion.

12:44.666 --> 12:47.133
I can push in a little bit more.

12:47.135 --> 12:50.102
Bike messenger drops a phone
on their table, rides off.

12:50.104 --> 12:51.103
Granger:
Person on the phone

12:51.105 --> 12:53.038
Orchestrated the whole thing.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.239
Any leads on the caller?

12:54.241 --> 12:55.707
Mm. Not yet.
We're tracking

12:55.709 --> 12:57.041
Cell activity
at the time of the call,

12:57.043 --> 12:58.709
But it looks like the phone
that was delivered

12:58.711 --> 13:01.178
To callen and sam
actually has a scrambler on it.

13:01.180 --> 13:03.297
Eric:
I'm also checking
into ongoing threats

13:03.298 --> 13:05.415
And past cases.
It's all still fluid.
But we got lucky

13:05.417 --> 13:09.118
With the bike messenger.
Yeah. A traffic cam
picked him up a block away.

13:09.120 --> 13:10.652
Got a hit on facial rec.

13:10.654 --> 13:13.287
His name is john baxter, 28,
from playa del rey.

13:13.289 --> 13:15.222
Nell:
The messenger company
john works for uses

13:15.224 --> 13:17.174
Gps to track their bikes.

13:17.175 --> 13:19.125
John rode north after
the explosion, then holed up.

13:19.127 --> 13:20.793
I sent the address
to your phones.

13:20.795 --> 13:23.128
Go pick him up
and find out who hired him.

13:23.130 --> 13:25.730
Done. And with pleasure.

13:28.034 --> 13:31.702
Our comms are down. So by
now ops knows what's up.

13:31.704 --> 13:33.904
Joelle, my family,
everyone's on lockdown.

13:33.906 --> 13:36.239
This could be somebody
we put away. This could be

13:36.241 --> 13:37.907
Somebody
we're investigating now.

13:37.909 --> 13:40.709
Could be someone who's not
even on the radar yet.

13:40.711 --> 13:42.444
The list of people who
wouldn't mind seeing us dead

13:42.446 --> 13:43.978
Is long and
distinguished.

13:43.980 --> 13:46.180
Let's narrow it down.
What do we know about this guy?

13:46.182 --> 13:48.182
He's a control freak.

13:48.184 --> 13:52.186
He wants to run the show.
He wants us to feel helpless.

13:52.188 --> 13:54.721
Wants to put us in
a no-win situation

13:54.723 --> 13:56.322
Where we die so others won't.

13:56.324 --> 13:57.723
No, that would
make us heroes.

13:57.725 --> 13:59.458
He wants us to die failing
to save people.

13:59.460 --> 14:01.793
(phone ringing)
(sighs)

14:04.731 --> 14:07.732
We left our car
and walked out here. Why?

14:07.734 --> 14:09.467
Man:
I needed to make sure
you weren't being tracked

14:09.469 --> 14:11.001
By your team.

14:11.003 --> 14:13.737
We dumped our comms
like you asked.

14:13.739 --> 14:15.805
And I'm supposed to just trust
that your superiors

14:15.807 --> 14:17.940
Didn't inject you
with-with a lojack?

14:17.942 --> 14:20.142
You have our
attention. Now what?

14:20.144 --> 14:22.210
Straight to the chase.

14:22.212 --> 14:24.478
No dinner, no dancing.

14:24.480 --> 14:28.215
Ah, I feel cheap.

14:28.217 --> 14:30.283
Today's plan's simple:
You do what I say

14:30.285 --> 14:32.018
Or I blow something else up.

14:32.020 --> 14:33.886
Yeah? Where's this bomb
going off?

14:33.888 --> 14:35.888
If I told you that, cutie pie,

14:35.890 --> 14:38.490
What would I do to fill
the rest of my day?

14:38.492 --> 14:40.492
We're gonna find you.

14:40.494 --> 14:42.861
That shouldn't be too hard.

14:42.863 --> 14:44.796
Why's that?

14:44.797 --> 14:46.730
'cause I'm gonna tell you
where to meet me.

14:46.733 --> 14:49.834
Shocking turn of events,
wouldn't you say?

14:49.836 --> 14:50.968
Where?

14:50.970 --> 14:53.170
You know that park off
of culver?

14:53.172 --> 14:54.971
Off culver?

14:54.973 --> 14:56.772
Yeah.

14:56.774 --> 14:59.841
Then you know it's 2.2 miles
from where you stand.

14:59.843 --> 15:02.844
Shorter if you don't abide
by property laws.

15:02.846 --> 15:05.346
You two have 20 minutes
to run there

15:05.348 --> 15:07.081
Or something else blows up.

15:07.083 --> 15:10.084
And this time it'll be
a lot bigger than a bus stop.

15:10.086 --> 15:11.819
Ticktock, boys.

15:11.821 --> 15:14.822
Ticktock.

15:20.762 --> 15:22.762
Yeah. Okay.
Thank you so much.

15:22.764 --> 15:24.964
So, the messenger company
didn't know anything

15:24.966 --> 15:26.432
About a delivery
to sam and callen.

15:26.434 --> 15:28.834
In fact, baxter wasn't
even scheduled to work today.

15:28.836 --> 15:30.902
The bike stopped here, so...

15:30.904 --> 15:33.371
And yet no bike.

15:33.373 --> 15:34.905
Well, it's got
to be somewhere.

15:34.907 --> 15:37.474
Yeah. Maybe.

15:48.420 --> 15:51.854
Well, looks like he ditched
the bike and took off.

15:52.990 --> 15:55.056
Deeks.

16:02.064 --> 16:05.131
Apparently the caller
doesn't like loose ends.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.276
(children chattering)

16:25.383 --> 16:28.083
Now I see why he didn't tell us
to dump our guns.

16:28.085 --> 16:30.418
He's got civilians
everywhere.

16:30.420 --> 16:32.887
He knows we won't
engage him.

16:32.889 --> 16:35.556
Okay, so where's this guy?

16:35.558 --> 16:37.457
Sam:
He's smart.

16:38.426 --> 16:41.460
And maybe
a little crazy.

16:41.462 --> 16:45.197
Sam:
On the swings.
You got to be kidding me.

16:54.908 --> 16:59.477
2.2 miles through l.A. In...

16:59.479 --> 17:02.279
19 minutes.

17:02.281 --> 17:04.214
I appreciate the effort.

17:04.216 --> 17:06.082
Would have been a shame not
to be able to look at y'all

17:06.084 --> 17:07.883
In the eyes.

17:07.885 --> 17:09.484
That's close enough.

17:10.453 --> 17:12.453
Nice location.

17:12.455 --> 17:14.588
Well protected.

17:14.590 --> 17:17.457
I could've gone for the whole
"meet me on a rooftop" thing.

17:17.459 --> 17:19.459
Search you, hope my guys

17:19.461 --> 17:22.228
Don't miss your backup weapons.

17:22.230 --> 17:24.096
Or we come to a park,

17:24.098 --> 17:26.331
Get some sun,

17:26.333 --> 17:28.933
Have some fun.

17:28.935 --> 17:30.567
Don't worry about them.

17:30.569 --> 17:33.503
You keep your
guns put away,

17:33.505 --> 17:35.137
So do they.

17:35.139 --> 17:37.539
You try and take me out,

17:37.541 --> 17:40.575
Their crossfire turns this park
into breaking news.

17:40.577 --> 17:42.577
Who are you?

17:42.579 --> 17:44.979
What did we do to you?

17:44.981 --> 17:47.114
You're running out of time.

17:47.116 --> 17:48.648
Where's the bomb?

17:49.617 --> 17:51.450
You have to earn that one.

17:51.452 --> 17:52.984
And how do we do that?

17:52.986 --> 17:56.453
See that pickup
parked on the street?

17:57.656 --> 18:00.023
Take it to 547 hill street.

18:00.025 --> 18:02.358
There's
an underground parking lot.

18:02.360 --> 18:03.525
What are we doing there?

18:03.527 --> 18:06.528
All in due time, agent hanna.

18:06.530 --> 18:08.596
But you know
what you're not gonna do--

18:08.598 --> 18:10.931
You're not gonna contact
your team. Mm-mm.

18:10.933 --> 18:14.034
You do that,
I blow up the target.

18:14.036 --> 18:16.903
You don't follow the orders,

18:16.905 --> 18:18.571
I blow up the target.

18:18.573 --> 18:20.506
We understand each other?

18:20.508 --> 18:23.041
Yeah.

18:23.043 --> 18:25.443
You got 20 minutes.

18:29.482 --> 18:31.548
(chuckles)

18:35.654 --> 18:37.520
I've been running searches
on callen and sam

18:37.522 --> 18:40.122
Across the entire city,
but after the explosion,

18:40.124 --> 18:41.923
It's like they disappeared.

18:41.925 --> 18:44.926
The caller's keeping them away
from surveillance cameras.

18:44.928 --> 18:47.561
Okay. So...

18:47.563 --> 18:51.097
We know that the bus stop
explosion happened here

18:51.099 --> 18:53.499
And then they went
northeast.
And that they haven't shown up

18:53.501 --> 18:55.601
On any surveillance
cameras after that.

18:55.603 --> 18:57.469
Either they're in an
area with a private

18:57.471 --> 18:59.537
Closed circuit
surveillance system...

18:59.539 --> 19:01.338
Or they're in a place
that doesn't have

19:01.340 --> 19:04.574
Any surveillance cameras.
Mm-hmm. Places
like this.

19:06.144 --> 19:08.144
I know that
neighborhood.

19:08.146 --> 19:09.445
Why send them here?

19:09.447 --> 19:12.114
Yeah.
There's no commercial buildings.

19:12.116 --> 19:14.116
No place where
people congregate.

19:14.118 --> 19:16.384
Nothing that would
be a viable target.

19:16.386 --> 19:18.052
Unless...

19:18.054 --> 19:19.520
Check this out.

19:19.522 --> 19:21.021
Yeah.

19:22.124 --> 19:23.590
Yeah. In the middle
of this neighborhood,

19:23.592 --> 19:25.491
There's a
public park.

19:25.493 --> 19:27.159
Hmm. Any cameras
in the park?

19:27.161 --> 19:29.628
Mmm. Yeah. One.

19:29.630 --> 19:31.630
It's for security
on the maintenance shed.

19:31.632 --> 19:34.633
Rewinding.

19:34.635 --> 19:35.967
Did you
see that?

19:35.969 --> 19:37.335
Yeah.

19:38.304 --> 19:40.704
Callen
and sam.

19:40.706 --> 19:43.306
I'll call kensi and deeks.

19:43.308 --> 19:45.374
Great. Thank you.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.710
Deeks: Two guys...

19:48.712 --> 19:50.645
Okay, thank you.

19:50.647 --> 19:52.580
Hey.
Hey.

19:52.582 --> 19:55.583
So, one of the moms
over there said she saw
callen and sam speaking

19:55.585 --> 19:57.384
To a guy on the swings.
By the swings?

19:57.386 --> 20:00.653
No, no. On the swings.
As in... Swinging.

20:00.655 --> 20:02.054
All right.

20:02.056 --> 20:03.688
Not much of a description

20:03.690 --> 20:04.755
But she did say that
it was a white male,

20:04.757 --> 20:06.423
Light-colored
jacket and jeans.

20:06.425 --> 20:08.091
That is fantastic.
That narrows it down

20:08.093 --> 20:10.193
To half of los angeles.
Precisely.

20:11.162 --> 20:13.695
Got to be honest,
this guy was thinking.

20:13.697 --> 20:15.697
Even if sam and callen
could get a shot off,

20:15.699 --> 20:17.498
They're not gonna take it.
There's too many kids.

20:17.500 --> 20:19.266
Yeah, but they still would have
tried to take him down.

20:19.268 --> 20:20.400
Which means if they didn't,

20:20.402 --> 20:21.401
He probably
had backup.

20:21.403 --> 20:23.236
Or another target
wired to blow.

20:23.238 --> 20:24.954
Maybe eric was able
to track them from here.

20:24.955 --> 20:26.671
Hey, so out of curiosity,
what do you think
of this neighborhood?

20:26.674 --> 20:29.107
It's fine.
'cause there's
this house

20:29.109 --> 20:31.375
For sale around the corner.
Could be perfect for...
Uh, perfect for what?

20:31.377 --> 20:33.176
I don't think you and I need
to be thinking about buying

20:33.178 --> 20:35.178
Something right now.
No, no, no, no, no.
Perfect for flipping.

20:35.180 --> 20:37.580
It's a house to flip.
What do you know
about flipping a house?

20:37.582 --> 20:39.715
A lot. I got a season pass
to<i> flip or flop.</i>

20:39.717 --> 20:40.782
(laughs)
seriously?

20:40.784 --> 20:42.383
No, I've studied
all their moves.

20:42.385 --> 20:44.118
Pretty much,
you always make a profit.

20:44.120 --> 20:45.152
That's 'cause they're pros.
That's what they do
for a living.

20:45.154 --> 20:46.937
Yeah, but I've
watched 30 episodes.

20:46.938 --> 20:48.721
I've taken copious notes.
I have the money in my savings.

20:48.724 --> 20:51.124
Now is the time, baby.
We got to make a move now.
Whoa, whoa.

20:51.126 --> 20:53.593
It's an op... Opportunity...
Come here. Come here, come here.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

20:53.595 --> 20:55.461
If you want to use your savings

20:55.463 --> 20:57.129
To flip a house, I'm all for it.

20:57.131 --> 21:01.199
I will support you. But if this
is about getting rich

21:01.201 --> 21:04.035
Or some primal need
to lavish me with jewels,

21:04.037 --> 21:05.703
I don't want to be a part of it.

21:05.705 --> 21:07.171
Lavish you with jewels?
Yes.

21:07.173 --> 21:08.772
Not everything's got
to be about you.

21:08.774 --> 21:10.641
I just want
to flip houses.

21:10.642 --> 21:12.509
I just want to make that money.
I want to get that paper.

21:12.511 --> 21:14.444
Okay.
Baby, so what do you think, huh?

21:14.446 --> 21:16.312
Pooling together our money?

21:16.314 --> 21:18.781
Flipping a house, you and I?
It would be a...

21:18.783 --> 21:20.449
A terrible idea.

21:20.451 --> 21:22.784
If by "terrible," you mean
"amazing" and you're in.

21:22.786 --> 21:26.053
I'm glad we talked about this.
I really feel better.

21:27.089 --> 21:28.822
Callen:<i> I know this guy's</i>
<i> got eyes on us,</i>

21:28.824 --> 21:31.558
But I haven't seen
a tail yet.

21:31.560 --> 21:33.593
The way this guy talks,

21:33.595 --> 21:35.828
The things he says, g--

21:35.830 --> 21:38.664
I don't like him.

21:38.666 --> 21:40.666
Well, I don't think
he'll be liking any

21:40.668 --> 21:43.201
Of your instagram pics
anytime soon.

22:01.787 --> 22:05.221
Callen:
Smart move.

22:05.223 --> 22:07.356
Hope eric doesn't
miss that.

22:35.385 --> 22:37.418
Storage building in
the jewelry district?

22:37.420 --> 22:40.387
Doesn't seem like the kind
of place he'd put the bomb.

22:40.389 --> 22:41.788
This guy wants a spectacle,

22:41.790 --> 22:43.656
And high visibility,
a lot of victims.

22:43.658 --> 22:45.758
This.. This isn't right.

22:45.760 --> 22:47.826
(phone ringing)

22:47.828 --> 22:51.362
Man:
You boys make it
to the parking structure?

22:51.364 --> 22:53.564
Yeah, we're here.

22:53.566 --> 22:55.165
What next?

22:55.167 --> 22:57.901
There's an import-export company
in this building.

22:57.903 --> 23:01.638
They just came into possession
of $11 million in diamonds.

23:01.640 --> 23:04.641
And you're going
to get those for me.

23:04.643 --> 23:06.643
This is about
dollars for you?

23:06.645 --> 23:08.645
And a little entertainment.

23:08.647 --> 23:10.279
Who knows what's gonna happen.

23:10.281 --> 23:12.547
You succeed,
I'm $11 million richer,

23:12.549 --> 23:16.617
And you stop a bomb from killing
thousands of people.

23:16.619 --> 23:18.151
You fail, you're just a couple

23:18.153 --> 23:20.586
Of federal agents
turned thieves.

23:20.588 --> 23:22.754
So, how are we supposed
to get the diamonds?

23:22.756 --> 23:25.289
You have your choice
of cutting torches

23:25.291 --> 23:27.858
In the back of the truck.

23:27.860 --> 23:31.761
Use them
to enter the steel access door.

23:31.763 --> 23:33.763
Enter the hallway.

23:33.765 --> 23:35.464
There'll be two
security guards.

23:35.466 --> 23:36.932
They're there to assist you.

23:36.934 --> 23:38.767
Do we have
to breach a safe?

23:38.769 --> 23:41.503
You have 20 minutes
to secure the diamonds.

23:41.505 --> 23:43.771
He hung up.

23:44.740 --> 23:47.507
He asked if we were here yet.

23:48.810 --> 23:52.278
He doesn't have eyes
or ears down here.

23:53.247 --> 23:55.614
Either way, he's
gonna blow the bomb.

23:55.616 --> 23:57.449
But he's not gonna do anything
until he finds out

23:57.451 --> 23:58.650
If we can deliver
these diamonds.

23:58.652 --> 24:00.918
(clicking)

24:00.920 --> 24:02.920
Watch your eyes.

24:02.922 --> 24:05.188
(whooshing and hissing)

24:09.260 --> 24:11.260
You found them?
Yeah.

24:11.262 --> 24:12.961
(beeping)

24:12.963 --> 24:14.862
Mta footage of the light
rail tracks downtown.

24:14.864 --> 24:17.464
That's callen and sam
in the pickup.

24:17.466 --> 24:20.500
Deeks:
They knew that making a right
across empty tracks on red

24:20.502 --> 24:21.985
Wouldn't draw
any attention.

24:21.986 --> 24:23.469
It didn't look suspicious if
anybody was watching, but...

24:23.471 --> 24:24.903
But it would trigger
the mta cameras to record.

24:24.905 --> 24:26.437
It's a good move.

24:26.439 --> 24:28.772
It's a<i> great</i> move.

24:28.774 --> 24:29.906
(computer chirps)

24:29.908 --> 24:32.275
Acetylene torches,
a drill, tools.

24:32.277 --> 24:34.877
Everything you need
to break open a steel door.

24:34.879 --> 24:37.880
Or a safe.

24:37.882 --> 24:39.481
Let's find those guards.

24:41.818 --> 24:43.517
Hey!
Callen:
Hey, guys.

24:43.519 --> 24:45.252
No one's supposed
to be back here.

24:45.254 --> 24:47.254
Put your hands up.

24:47.256 --> 24:48.822
You're not expecting
us, are you?

24:48.824 --> 24:50.423
Get out your cuffs.

24:51.826 --> 24:54.993
(grunting)

24:54.995 --> 24:58.329
(grunts)

24:58.331 --> 25:00.664
(grunting)

25:06.538 --> 25:08.671
There'll be two
security guards.

25:08.673 --> 25:11.306
They are there to assist you.

25:11.308 --> 25:14.008
I really don't like this guy.

25:23.552 --> 25:25.785
(phone ringing)

25:25.787 --> 25:27.753
Sam?

25:27.755 --> 25:30.622
(phone continues ringing)

25:30.624 --> 25:31.956
(phone beeps on)

25:31.958 --> 25:33.924
Yeah?
(caller chuckles)

25:33.926 --> 25:37.027
I figured it was 50-50
whether you'd answer the phone.

25:37.029 --> 25:39.729
I guess the rent-a-cops
trigger fingers weren't as itchy

25:39.731 --> 25:41.797
As I was expecting.

25:41.799 --> 25:43.331
Those rent-a-cops
are doing their job.

25:43.333 --> 25:44.632
This is a legit business.

25:44.634 --> 25:46.266
Right-o.

25:46.268 --> 25:48.468
So take the keys off
one of the guards.

25:48.470 --> 25:50.803
Open the secured room
at the end of the hall.

25:50.805 --> 25:52.704
That's where the safe is.

25:52.706 --> 25:56.641
We'll need time
to open a safe.

25:56.643 --> 25:58.827
And you're gonna have it.

25:58.828 --> 26:01.012
Just meet me at the
main street plaza in 45 minutes

26:01.014 --> 26:03.014
With the diamonds.

26:03.016 --> 26:05.282
(click, phone beeps off)

26:07.486 --> 26:09.686
What do you got, beale?

26:09.688 --> 26:10.853
I backtracked the movements

26:10.855 --> 26:12.754
Of the pickup truck
throughout the day.

26:12.756 --> 26:14.956
This is the guy
who drove the truck to the park

26:14.958 --> 26:17.325
Where callen
and sam picked it up.

26:17.326 --> 26:19.693
Got an id on him?
No, there's never a
clean shot of his face.

26:19.696 --> 26:20.594
What about
the building
behind it?

26:20.596 --> 26:21.828
It's an auto repair shop.

26:21.830 --> 26:23.429
I sent the address
to your phones.

26:23.431 --> 26:24.563
All right, we'll
go check it out.

26:24.565 --> 26:25.764
Before you do that,

26:25.766 --> 26:27.065
You're gonna
want to see this.

26:27.067 --> 26:29.067
So, no surveillance camera
in the park

26:29.069 --> 26:30.835
Picked up an image
of the caller,

26:30.837 --> 26:33.504
But that doesn't necessarily
mean he wasn't photographed.

26:33.506 --> 26:35.606
So, I used geotracking

26:35.608 --> 26:37.441
To scan through various
social media platforms.

26:37.443 --> 26:38.775
I looked for photos

26:38.777 --> 26:40.510
That were taken
at the same time

26:40.512 --> 26:42.512
Callen and sam
were in the park, and...

26:42.514 --> 26:44.013
I found this.

26:44.015 --> 26:45.914
Tell me that guy's
in the system.
Yup.

26:45.916 --> 26:47.415
Got a hit on facial rec.

26:47.417 --> 26:49.049
His name is chad brunson.

26:49.051 --> 26:51.584
Chad brunson?
That doesn't ring a bell.

26:51.586 --> 26:53.919
Nell:
What about his brother--
tyler brunson?

26:53.921 --> 26:56.755
That's the guy who used the

26:56.757 --> 26:59.457
<i> Uss watertown</i> to smuggle the
drug krokodil into the country.

26:59.459 --> 27:01.659
He was working with that
scumbag paul angelo.

27:01.661 --> 27:02.893
Yeah, angelo outed

27:02.895 --> 27:04.794
Callen and sam
as federal agents

27:04.796 --> 27:06.796
While they were posing
as high-end dealers.

27:06.798 --> 27:08.531
We took tyler brunson down
at the marina.

27:08.533 --> 27:09.965
Brunson raised
his gun on sam.

27:09.967 --> 27:12.801
And that is never
a good thing to do.

27:12.803 --> 27:14.035
Granger:
It's all about revenge.

27:14.037 --> 27:15.903
Eric
hey, it says here
that in '92,

27:15.905 --> 27:17.738
A high school principal was
having, um,

27:17.740 --> 27:20.774
"disciplinary issues"
with younger brother tyler.

27:20.776 --> 27:23.843
Principal was found dead--
beaten to death in his office.

27:23.845 --> 27:26.679
And the evidence pointed
to chad brunson?

27:26.681 --> 27:27.946
No evidence needed.

27:27.948 --> 27:30.748
Chad called it in,
told them he did it himself.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.049
Police never found him.

27:32.051 --> 27:33.717
He was off the grid till 2013

27:33.719 --> 27:35.819
When he became a person
of interest

27:35.821 --> 27:37.453
In a double homicide in bali.

27:37.455 --> 27:39.788
Guess he disappeared before
the locals could pick him up.

27:39.790 --> 27:43.391
(computer chirping)
guys, I got callen and sam.

27:43.393 --> 27:44.658
They're on a security camera

27:44.660 --> 27:46.359
At a parking structure
on hill street, downtown.

27:46.361 --> 27:48.077
Deeks:
That's the jewelry district.

27:48.078 --> 27:49.794
Lot of steel doors and cases
for that cutting torch.

27:49.797 --> 27:51.664
Locate callen and sam.

27:51.665 --> 27:53.532
If you can get close to them
without being spotted, do it.

27:53.534 --> 27:54.933
Copy that.
What about the
auto repair shop?

27:54.935 --> 27:56.935
Granger:
I'll check it out.
You gonna do that alone?

27:56.937 --> 27:59.971
I could, uh,
get my, um...

28:00.773 --> 28:02.038
Oh.

28:02.040 --> 28:03.806
I got nell.

28:03.808 --> 28:06.909
And I'll get my things.

28:06.911 --> 28:08.977
All right.

28:09.913 --> 28:11.979
I'll hold down the fort.

28:12.748 --> 28:14.814
That's the pickup.

28:24.058 --> 28:26.091
Easy.

28:26.093 --> 28:27.425
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

28:27.427 --> 28:28.592
You know what they say

28:28.594 --> 28:29.759
About sneaking up on a guy?

28:29.761 --> 28:30.760
No.

28:30.762 --> 28:32.895
I don't, either.

28:32.897 --> 28:34.730
Nice.
Callen:
Good to see you two.

28:34.732 --> 28:36.682
Yeah.

28:36.683 --> 28:38.633
Sam is working on a safe inside,
but we need to stay out here.

28:38.635 --> 28:40.901
I don't think this guy has eyes
or ears inside this garage.

28:40.903 --> 28:43.570
All right, we got a name
for you-- chad brunson.

28:43.572 --> 28:44.604
Brunson?

28:44.606 --> 28:46.439
Brother of
tyler brunson.

28:46.441 --> 28:48.841
Brother's keeper.

28:48.843 --> 28:50.776
This is a straight
revenge play.

28:50.778 --> 28:51.943
Oh, yeah.

28:51.945 --> 28:53.811
Someone gave us up.

28:53.813 --> 28:55.579
Gave him our names.

28:55.581 --> 28:57.647
That's gonna have to be
a problem for another day.

28:57.649 --> 28:59.015
For now,
what do you need from us?

28:59.017 --> 29:00.783
Follow us when we leave.

29:00.785 --> 29:02.818
We're have to bring
these diamonds to brunson

29:02.820 --> 29:04.653
In exchange
for the location of a bomb.

29:04.655 --> 29:06.888
All right, we'll alert the bomb
squad, have them ready to move.

29:06.890 --> 29:08.789
Brought you a comms,
new tracker.

29:08.791 --> 29:10.657
Should be easy
to keep tabs on him.

29:10.659 --> 29:12.959
I don't think he's gonna let
these diamonds out of his sight.

29:12.961 --> 29:15.027
We got your six up there.

29:28.041 --> 29:30.107
Open it.
Yup.

29:32.811 --> 29:34.744
(click)
got it.

29:35.713 --> 29:37.779
Got it?
Ready.

29:47.823 --> 29:50.223
Clear!

29:50.225 --> 29:52.491
Clear.

30:03.636 --> 30:05.636
If you have
a question, ask it.

30:05.638 --> 30:09.006
Cool.

30:09.008 --> 30:11.174
I, uh... I didn't know

30:11.176 --> 30:14.677
If this was more
of a mr. Miyagi, daniel-san,

30:14.679 --> 30:17.112
Don't-ask-any-questions
kind of thing, or...

30:17.114 --> 30:19.114
You know.

30:19.116 --> 30:22.617
Somebody shoot me in the head.

30:22.619 --> 30:25.853
Sorry.

30:25.855 --> 30:28.055
So, what's your question?

30:28.057 --> 30:31.725
Well, we breached the space,
and it's empty.

30:31.727 --> 30:34.060
So, what's the first thing
you look for?

30:34.062 --> 30:36.629
Anomalies.

30:36.631 --> 30:39.898
Anomalies. Right.

30:39.900 --> 30:41.766
Yeah, this is an
auto repair shop.

30:41.768 --> 30:43.200
What's here that
shouldn't be?

30:43.202 --> 30:45.001
What isn't here
that should be?
Mm-hmm.

30:45.003 --> 30:47.169
No cars, no trucks,
no motorcycles.

30:47.171 --> 30:49.237
No customers.

30:53.009 --> 30:54.641
I think they were
working on something

30:54.643 --> 30:56.876
That was parked right
here-- something big,

30:56.878 --> 30:58.944
Judging by those tires.

31:00.914 --> 31:03.781
Probably a cargo truck.
Mm.

31:03.783 --> 31:06.917
Eric said he couldn't find
a surveillance camera angle

31:06.919 --> 31:08.885
On the front of the building.

31:08.887 --> 31:11.087
So, if they drove a cargo truck
out of here,

31:11.089 --> 31:13.089
We would have no way
to identify it.

31:13.091 --> 31:14.723
No way to track it.

31:14.725 --> 31:18.093
Well, we might be
able to identify it.

31:18.095 --> 31:20.095
Okay.

31:20.097 --> 31:22.097
Companies use this material

31:22.099 --> 31:25.633
To put logos on cars and trucks.

31:25.635 --> 31:28.068
Give me a hand here.
Yeah.

31:39.146 --> 31:41.279
Now, if this is
what they were doing

31:41.281 --> 31:43.014
To that cargo truck...

31:43.016 --> 31:45.116
Maybe we<i> can</i> identify
and track it.

31:45.118 --> 31:47.785
Exactly.

31:47.787 --> 31:50.720
Miyagi ain't got
nothin' on you.

31:51.956 --> 31:54.022
Sir.

31:58.128 --> 32:00.194
(torch hissing)

32:19.247 --> 32:21.580
Are we good?

32:23.216 --> 32:25.216
Got 'em.

32:25.218 --> 32:27.284
Let's do it.

32:29.755 --> 32:32.222
Hey.

32:32.224 --> 32:34.591
Courtesy of
kensi and deeks.

32:35.260 --> 32:38.361
And they didn't even
come in and say hello.

32:42.834 --> 32:44.633
All righty, it's on.

32:44.635 --> 32:46.968
Oh, by the way,
want to know who this guy is?

32:56.245 --> 32:57.310
"rosecrans

32:57.312 --> 32:59.779
Catering."
call it in.
Yeah.

32:59.781 --> 33:01.347
Eric:
Hello?

33:01.349 --> 33:03.266
Beale?

33:03.267 --> 33:05.184
We're looking
for a large cargo van or truck

33:05.186 --> 33:08.620
With "rosecrans
catering" on the side.

33:08.622 --> 33:11.389
(crowd chatter)

33:16.962 --> 33:18.962
Let me hold that.

33:18.964 --> 33:20.964
Where's the bomb?

33:20.966 --> 33:23.199
Diamonds first.

33:30.107 --> 33:32.173
(clinking)

33:34.877 --> 33:36.676
Don't you want
to check the stones?

33:36.678 --> 33:39.311
Nah. Wasn't really
about the diamonds.

33:39.313 --> 33:41.179
Nice bonus, though.

33:41.181 --> 33:45.349
My name's chad brunson.

33:45.351 --> 33:47.417
That mean anything to you?
Callen:
Brunson.

33:49.354 --> 33:51.721
You related to
tyler brunson?

33:51.723 --> 33:55.124
I was...
Until your team killed him.

33:55.126 --> 33:57.126
Sam:
Our team didn't

33:57.128 --> 33:59.128
Shoot him.

33:59.130 --> 34:01.230
I did.

34:05.336 --> 34:08.070
Why don't you let him go,
tell him where the bomb is?

34:08.072 --> 34:09.938
You can have me.

34:09.940 --> 34:11.339
I'm who you want.

34:13.409 --> 34:15.409
Nah.

34:15.411 --> 34:17.444
It's a nice offer, but, uh...

34:17.446 --> 34:19.446
I'll stick with my plan.

34:19.448 --> 34:22.749
Who wants to go get blown up?

34:22.751 --> 34:26.252
Guys, lapd just issued an apb
on two men

34:26.254 --> 34:28.053
Matching your description.

34:28.055 --> 34:29.354
Where is the bomb?

34:29.356 --> 34:32.390
The exact location
and the delivery method--

34:32.392 --> 34:35.726
You know, I'm not going to say.
Uh, you got to find that out.

34:35.728 --> 34:36.793
That wasn't the deal.

34:36.795 --> 34:39.462
Yeah. It<i> was</i> the deal.

34:39.464 --> 34:43.365
You run around town
for my amusement and my profit,

34:43.367 --> 34:46.301
And I tell you that...

34:46.303 --> 34:49.203
The convention center's
gonna blow up.

34:50.906 --> 34:53.706
It's a big place,
lot of people to move.

34:53.708 --> 34:55.407
Chop, chop.

34:55.409 --> 34:57.342
How long do we have?

34:57.344 --> 35:00.144
You got enough for me to make it
to my front row seat

35:00.146 --> 35:02.846
So I can watch you get blown up
with the rest of them.

35:02.848 --> 35:06.015
Oh, and, um, just
to make things interesting,

35:06.017 --> 35:09.084
I phoned in the diamond robbery
to the l.A.P.D.

35:09.086 --> 35:11.920
They're looking
for you two gentlemen.

35:11.922 --> 35:13.488
(garbled radio transmission)

35:13.490 --> 35:15.823
Yeah, I think
I got our suspects.

35:15.825 --> 35:17.391
Lapd!

35:17.393 --> 35:19.493
Stay where you are!

35:24.432 --> 35:28.801
Did lapd detain callen and sam?

35:28.803 --> 35:32.437
No, they made it to the pickup
truck, but lapd is in pursuit.

35:32.439 --> 35:35.339
Brunson?
Uh, he got into a car
with two others.

35:35.341 --> 35:36.873
And kensi and deeks?

35:36.875 --> 35:39.942
Covering callen and sam
at a distance.

35:39.944 --> 35:43.378
(computer beeps)
hetty, rosecrans catering
is the official caterer

35:43.380 --> 35:44.379
Of the convention center.

35:44.381 --> 35:46.114
That's

35:46.116 --> 35:47.915
How brunson is
getting the bomb

35:47.917 --> 35:51.385
Into the center.

35:51.387 --> 35:54.054
Hetty, there's a huge car show
going on there today.

35:54.056 --> 35:56.289
There are thousands of people
inside the center.

35:56.291 --> 35:57.823
Of course there are.

35:59.760 --> 36:02.260
(tires squeaking)

36:02.262 --> 36:04.028
Kensi:
There they are.

36:04.030 --> 36:06.030
(tires squealing)

36:06.032 --> 36:08.266
(distant sirens)

36:08.267 --> 36:10.501
Kensi:
Callen, sam, got eyes on you
and holding position.

36:10.503 --> 36:12.369
(sirens blaring)

36:13.171 --> 36:15.437
(sirens blaring)

36:15.439 --> 36:18.406
(tires squealing)

36:18.408 --> 36:22.109
Driver, out of your vehicle now!

36:22.111 --> 36:23.376
I said, out of the vehicle!

36:27.482 --> 36:31.116
(explosion)

36:31.118 --> 36:33.151
(car alarms sounding)
callen, sam, you okay?

36:33.153 --> 36:35.453
We're good.

36:35.455 --> 36:37.955
We're just east
of the south corner.

36:37.957 --> 36:39.990
You located that bomb yet?
Deeks:
Yeah.

36:39.992 --> 36:42.125
He's sending it to the arena
inside of a catering truck.

36:42.127 --> 36:45.061
Well...

36:45.063 --> 36:46.896
(sighs)

36:46.898 --> 36:49.365
Let's find that truck.

36:58.842 --> 37:01.909
(tires squealing,
engine revving)

37:01.911 --> 37:03.911
Callen:
Eric, has

37:03.913 --> 37:06.346
Convention center security or
lapd started the evacuation?

37:06.348 --> 37:07.814
It's in progress now.

37:07.816 --> 37:09.849
Is the catering truck
still on flower street?

37:09.851 --> 37:11.317
He turned onto venice.

37:11.319 --> 37:13.085
Take the right up ahead.

37:13.087 --> 37:14.553
You're running parallel
to the truck.

37:14.555 --> 37:16.087
He's approaching

37:16.089 --> 37:17.154
The convention center now.

37:17.156 --> 37:19.156
Kensi, don't let
that truck

37:19.158 --> 37:21.892
Get anywhere near
the convention center.

37:21.894 --> 37:23.877
I got this, hetty.

37:23.878 --> 37:25.861
Man (over p.A.): Please leave
the convention center

37:25.864 --> 37:28.064
Calmly and immediately.
Please locate your nearest exit.

37:28.066 --> 37:30.299
(loud crowd chatter)

37:37.274 --> 37:40.508
(tires squealing)

37:40.510 --> 37:43.377
Hands up! Put 'em up right now!

37:43.379 --> 37:45.112
Put your hands up
and leave 'em up.

37:45.114 --> 37:47.213
Look at me.

37:49.884 --> 37:51.516
(grunts)
leave 'em up!

37:51.518 --> 37:53.584
Don't!
(grunts)

37:57.289 --> 37:59.922
Clear!

37:59.924 --> 38:01.990
Detonator secured.

38:06.096 --> 38:09.564
Ammonium nitrate,

38:09.566 --> 38:12.165
Diesel fuel
wrapped in tovex.

38:15.603 --> 38:17.936
Big boom,
but it's easy to disarm.

38:17.938 --> 38:19.437
There's a timer.
(beeping)

38:19.439 --> 38:21.605
It's a failsafe.
We got less than two minutes.

38:21.607 --> 38:23.306
(beeping)

38:23.308 --> 38:24.974
Guys, I got movement
on the tracker.

38:24.976 --> 38:27.042
Brunson is closing in
on your position

38:27.044 --> 38:29.878
From the north fast.

38:29.880 --> 38:31.579
You good?
Just buy me
a few seconds.

38:33.015 --> 38:34.481
That's them.

38:34.483 --> 38:37.083
(engine revving)

38:38.386 --> 38:40.386
(tires squealing)

38:48.295 --> 38:49.394
(grunts)

38:59.105 --> 39:00.070
(grunts)

39:00.072 --> 39:01.971
(panting)

39:01.973 --> 39:04.473
(grunting)

39:04.475 --> 39:07.108
Bomb's disarmed!

39:12.214 --> 39:15.215
(chad groaning)

39:15.217 --> 39:17.217
(groaning)

39:17.219 --> 39:19.219
(panting)

39:19.221 --> 39:21.454
Okay, okay.

39:21.456 --> 39:23.456
You got me.

39:23.458 --> 39:27.126
Checkmate
and all of that.

39:27.128 --> 39:30.329
Now for sure you got a question
to ask me, don't you?

39:30.331 --> 39:33.632
Aah! (groaning)

39:33.634 --> 39:36.134
You want to know...

39:36.136 --> 39:38.136
Who gave me the names
of the federal agents

39:38.138 --> 39:40.271
That shot my little brother.

39:40.273 --> 39:41.672
(laughs)

39:41.674 --> 39:44.441
You guys
don't got a clue.

39:44.443 --> 39:47.076
One of your own...

39:47.078 --> 39:49.978
Is gonna burn you down
from the inside.

39:49.980 --> 39:52.080
Show us your other
hand, brunson.

39:52.082 --> 39:54.148
(coughing)

39:54.150 --> 39:56.617
(grunts)

39:56.619 --> 39:58.685
(exhales)

40:14.536 --> 40:16.536
What?

40:16.538 --> 40:18.538
Uh, nothing.

40:18.540 --> 40:21.007
I'm done, so...

40:21.009 --> 40:22.575
I guess have a good night.

40:22.577 --> 40:24.009
(laughs)

40:24.011 --> 40:26.077
You, too.

40:32.718 --> 40:37.020
Uh... Thank you,
assistant director, for

40:37.022 --> 40:38.354
Letting me tag along today.

40:38.356 --> 40:41.390
I just hope I didn't get
in the way, or anything.

40:41.392 --> 40:43.024
Sir.

40:43.026 --> 40:45.159
Don't do that.

40:45.161 --> 40:46.693
Excuse me?

40:50.098 --> 40:52.731
I didn't let you
tag along today.

40:52.733 --> 40:56.534
I brought you with me
because I needed backup,

40:56.536 --> 40:58.369
And you have
field experience.

40:58.371 --> 41:01.638
Okay.

41:01.640 --> 41:04.207
Never belittle yourself
or your accomplishments.

41:04.209 --> 41:06.175
You deserve the respect
you've gotten.

41:07.778 --> 41:10.612
You've earned it.

41:15.051 --> 41:18.452
(phone ringing)

41:22.090 --> 41:24.090
Deeks:
At this point, why even

41:24.092 --> 41:25.458
Go to bed, you know?

41:25.460 --> 41:27.092
I feel like if I just
keep moving, I'll be fine.

41:27.094 --> 41:29.294
Ooh, I have a good idea.
Let's go grab burgers, huh?

41:29.296 --> 41:31.062
Double-double,
animal style. My treat.

41:31.064 --> 41:32.614
Who's with me?

41:32.615 --> 41:34.165
You know they make animal-style
fries, too?
Of course I do.

41:34.167 --> 41:35.332
Nell, what do you think?

41:35.334 --> 41:37.033
A little dooble,
doo-ble in your future?

41:37.035 --> 41:40.336
I think that sounds fun.
Kensi:
Awesome.

41:40.338 --> 41:41.637
You okay?

41:41.639 --> 41:43.372
Yeah.

41:43.374 --> 41:45.240
You sure?

41:45.242 --> 41:47.308
Hey, how about we grab eric
on the way out?

41:47.310 --> 41:48.575
That's a fantastic idea.

41:48.577 --> 41:50.043
It gives us an opportunity

41:50.044 --> 41:51.510
To talk to him about our
house-flipping business.
No!

41:51.513 --> 41:53.046
No, deeks!
What?

41:53.047 --> 41:54.580
No, this is not<i> our</i> business,
and I am not letting you

41:54.582 --> 41:56.048
Pillage my savings
for this.

41:56.050 --> 41:57.700
Oh, that's a shame because

41:57.701 --> 41:59.351
My house-flipping business is
gonna take the world by storm.

41:59.353 --> 42:01.119
(grunts)
all right?
It's gonna be a tv show.

42:01.121 --> 42:02.620
Me and monte
take over the world.

42:02.622 --> 42:05.489
That's all he said?

42:05.491 --> 42:07.757
Yeah.

42:07.759 --> 42:09.759
The mere fact

42:09.761 --> 42:13.763
That chad brunson got the names

42:13.765 --> 42:17.099
Of the team members
responsible for taking down

42:17.101 --> 42:18.800
His brother--

42:18.802 --> 42:20.601
It's troubling.

42:20.603 --> 42:22.536
Well, if that information
came from inside ncis,

42:22.538 --> 42:24.271
It's more than
just troubling.

42:24.273 --> 42:26.172
Oh, of course, I agree.
Granger:
There's a good chance

42:26.174 --> 42:28.774
The mole we apprehended last
year gave up this information

42:28.776 --> 42:30.475
Before we got him.

42:30.477 --> 42:32.210
And we still don't know
who he was working for?

42:32.212 --> 42:33.644
We don't.

42:33.646 --> 42:35.145
Callen:
What about paul angelo,

42:35.147 --> 42:37.280
The guy that gave us up
to tyler brunson?

42:37.282 --> 42:39.081
I'll speak to him.

42:40.184 --> 42:42.184
We want to be there
when you...

42:42.186 --> 42:44.719
I'm handling paul angelo.

42:44.721 --> 42:46.721
Why don't you

42:46.723 --> 42:48.723
Go home and get some rest?

42:48.725 --> 42:50.658
Take Monday off.

42:50.660 --> 42:52.359
You've earned it.

42:52.361 --> 42:53.860
Today is Monday, hetty.

42:53.862 --> 42:55.161
Oh.

42:56.731 --> 42:58.697
Hetty:
<i>Then I'll see you two tomorrow.</i>
