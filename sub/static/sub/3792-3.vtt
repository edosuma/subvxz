01:09.941 --> 01:11.550
- You find anything?
- Nothing.

01:11.650 --> 01:13.319
Your brother's turned
into a health nut.

01:13.357 --> 01:16.020
All he's got are whole grains
and a bottle of flaxseed oil.

01:16.781 --> 01:18.807
You want to do a couple
of colon-cleansing shots?

01:18.950 --> 01:19.950
No, let's just order in.

01:20.450 --> 01:22.593
From where? I don't even know
what zip code we're in.

01:22.728 --> 01:24.348
Are you feeling a little displaced?

01:24.450 --> 01:26.750
- Very.
- We'll get a new home soon, I promise.

01:26.911 --> 01:29.998
Yeah, thanks. That makes me almost feel
good enough to eat some of this shit.

01:30.108 --> 01:32.050
What is psyllium husk anyway?

01:32.216 --> 01:33.239
Morning.

01:33.624 --> 01:34.750
Morning, How'd you sleep?

01:35.125 --> 01:36.340
Oh, fine I'm sure.

01:36.437 --> 01:39.639
Someone got all cozy on the couch while
I was stucksleeping on the air mattress.

01:39.774 --> 01:42.020
Yeah, it was real cozy listening
to you snore all night.

01:42.174 --> 01:44.701
And please tell me I didn't catch
you whacking it at 4:00 a. m.

01:45.174 --> 01:48.149
Fuck, I got to get some privacy.
You got to get people to see this movie.

01:48.243 --> 01:50.095
- E doesn't think so.
- Oh boy, here we go.

01:50.178 --> 01:53.063
E thought <I>Rocky IV</I> sucked
when it came out. What does he know?

01:53.139 --> 01:55.068
E, I'm telling you,
you're just too close to it.

01:55.250 --> 01:57.250
- <I>Medellin</I> is a great film.
- It will be.

01:57.832 --> 01:59.279
Will be? You have a change of heart?

01:59.350 --> 02:02.000
I thought all night. There's
greatness in it. It's just too long.

02:02.050 --> 02:03.764
I got some ideas
on how to cut some stuff.

02:03.860 --> 02:05.904
I think we can cut
the crooked customs cop sequence

02:05.982 --> 02:07.236
in half for starters though,no?

02:07.350 --> 02:09.021
Yeah, it was a little long.

02:09.750 --> 02:11.274
Call Walsh.
Run your ideas by him.

02:11.376 --> 02:13.306
I'm gonna go down there,
talk to him in person.

02:13.350 --> 02:15.225
But be positive.
you know how sensitive he is.

02:15.350 --> 02:16.450
No, is he really?

02:16.845 --> 02:19.411
Namaste, campers.
rise and shine.

02:19.893 --> 02:21.012
Campers are up, Johnny.

02:21.150 --> 02:24.249
And we're dying for some unhealthy eats,
so please tell us you got something.

02:24.351 --> 02:26.280
Fried egg sandwiches
from the bagel broker.

02:26.400 --> 02:27.460
- Nice.
- Yes!

02:27.572 --> 02:29.694
Not the kind of garbage
I like to put in my body,

02:29.750 --> 02:30.769
but you know my motto...

02:30.865 --> 02:32.852
"When you have guests,
give them what they want."

02:32.950 --> 02:34.649
You're running
the regular b&b over here.

02:34.765 --> 02:36.752
We appreciate you putting us up, Johnny.

02:37.022 --> 02:38.102
Right, guys?

02:39.062 --> 02:40.856
No need to thank me, fellas.

02:41.014 --> 02:44.216
To house my kid brother and his friends
gives me nothing but pure joy.

02:44.645 --> 02:46.864
Or as they say in yiddish, nachas.

02:47.188 --> 02:49.889
Besides,god has already
rewarded me for my good deeds.

02:50.150 --> 02:52.323
Oh yeah? What did he do?
Un-recede your hairline?

02:52.651 --> 02:53.660
No, dickhead.

02:53.737 --> 02:55.608
What he did was finally
answer an old prayer

02:55.744 --> 02:58.811
- and deliver Donna Deveny to me.
- Who's Donna Deveny?

02:59.012 --> 03:02.735
Only one of the finest pieces of
party-girl ass this town has ever known.

03:03.139 --> 03:05.493
I used to kick it
with her back in my whiskey-bar days,

03:05.608 --> 03:07.050
but never officially closed it.

03:07.674 --> 03:09.498
I've been dreaming
of fucking her ever since.

03:09.633 --> 03:11.979
- When are you seeing her?
- Today, bro. And Turtle,

03:13.050 --> 03:14.810
- She's got a friend.
- What kind of friend

03:15.284 --> 03:18.160
- A hot one with a house in Malibu.
- Really?

03:18.314 --> 03:22.250
Precisely the kind of girls we want
to be friends with come June and July.

03:22.350 --> 03:24.280
What, no girl for me and E?

03:25.982 --> 03:26.985
I got Walsh today.

03:27.062 --> 03:29.512
I'll let you and Turtle battle
it out for the friend though.

03:29.798 --> 03:31.150
What? it's only fair, right?

03:33.061 --> 03:35.260
You wonder why
I'm whacking off late at night.

03:37.390 --> 03:38.585
Hey, I just want you to know

03:38.663 --> 03:40.844
I appreciate you guys
not leaving me home alone today.

03:41.150 --> 03:43.950
And don't worry,
I'm going to be invisible.

03:44.278 --> 03:45.552
You won't even know I'm there.

03:46.150 --> 03:49.678
That's great, but just in case
you wind up not being so invisible,

03:49.988 --> 03:52.323
could you try and at least
take Drama's girl and not mine?

03:52.450 --> 03:53.829
Go fuck yourself, Turtle.

03:54.042 --> 03:56.150
You wouldn't even have a girl
to get taken by Vince

03:56.250 --> 03:58.250
- if it wasn't for me.
- Life sucks.

03:58.347 --> 04:00.199
It's gonna be okay, Turtle. I promise.

04:03.536 --> 04:05.273
Oh, shit. Look at this one.

04:08.150 --> 04:09.517
Hey, Vince. What are you up to?

04:09.933 --> 04:13.193
Not much, just being a fifth wheel
on my boys' double date.

04:13.450 --> 04:15.352
- That sounds awful.
- Doesn't it?

04:15.512 --> 04:17.510
I'm gonna go hang out
at my friend's beach house.

04:17.637 --> 04:18.774
Do you want to come?

04:19.050 --> 04:20.750
Yes, I think I do.

04:21.550 --> 04:22.556
Excuse me.

04:23.002 --> 04:24.050
You mind, Turtle?

04:25.050 --> 04:26.749
No.
I told you it would be all right.

04:35.250 --> 04:37.350
I would give my nuts
to be that guy for one day.

04:38.008 --> 04:40.015
Well, if you had no nuts,
what would be the use?

04:41.350 --> 04:44.150
Or would you then be hoping
that you had Vince's nuts?

04:46.350 --> 04:47.450
What, no comeback?

04:47.631 --> 04:49.522
You're too dumb to even respond to.

04:54.871 --> 04:56.607
- Buenos dias.
- What up, dog?

04:57.231 --> 04:58.909
Your English is getting better, juan.

04:59.394 --> 05:00.550
Oh, what's this?

05:01.268 --> 05:04.278
The trailer Billy had me cut together
for next year's american film market.

05:06.053 --> 05:07.307
Behind the greed,

05:08.717 --> 05:10.048
behind the legend...

05:12.382 --> 05:13.501
Was the man.

05:17.956 --> 05:19.450
- Wow, this looks great.
- Yeah.

05:20.208 --> 05:21.964
- If only the movie looked so good.
- What?

05:23.250 --> 05:24.950
- What?
- Nothing. I didn't say nothing.

05:25.750 --> 05:26.939
There he is,

05:27.050 --> 05:30.273
fresh from the dry cleaners!
My one and only favorite suit.

05:30.450 --> 05:32.943
- How are you doing, Billy?
- Come here, E, give me some love.

05:34.744 --> 05:36.075
What do you think of the trailer?

05:36.163 --> 05:37.841
What little I saw of it looks amazing.

05:38.290 --> 05:39.756
It looks even better on replay.

05:40.116 --> 05:42.050
Take this home
and finger yourself to it, suit.

05:42.150 --> 05:43.249
For your eyes only.

05:43.250 --> 05:46.150
Consider it a little gift
for your kind words last night.

05:46.664 --> 05:48.381
I know we haven't always seen
eye to eye,

05:48.458 --> 05:50.249
but your support
for my vision of this film,

05:50.309 --> 05:52.007
for allowing me
to make it the right way,

05:52.102 --> 05:53.954
has taught me that artists
and capitalist pigs

05:54.012 --> 05:55.711
might be able
to work together after all.

05:55.923 --> 05:57.962
I'm making very little money
for a capitalist pig.

05:58.078 --> 05:59.351
I didn't say you're good at it.

05:59.982 --> 06:01.314
Seriously, through all this shit,

06:01.333 --> 06:03.436
all that matters is that
we went off to war together

06:03.513 --> 06:04.921
and came home with our limbs intact

06:04.979 --> 06:06.870
and a fucking masterpiece
in the can, right?

06:07.250 --> 06:08.550
- Right.
- Want a beer?

06:08.729 --> 06:09.752
Sure.

06:12.250 --> 06:13.649
I did have a few thoughts though.

06:15.235 --> 06:16.249
Thoughts?

06:16.250 --> 06:17.917
Some ideas
I wanted to talk to you about.

06:17.956 --> 06:18.987
You mean like notes?

06:19.572 --> 06:22.650
No, just some small changes I thought
might help make the film play better.

06:22.741 --> 06:24.949
Last night you said that you loved it.
You were lying?

06:24.950 --> 06:25.950
No, I think it's great.

06:26.595 --> 06:27.598
But?

06:27.850 --> 06:29.925
- But I think it needs work.
- Fuck what you think,

06:30.072 --> 06:32.690
Because I love it and Vinnie loved it,
and I know he ain't lying.

06:32.748 --> 06:34.715
And the Cannes people
are going to love it too.

06:34.792 --> 06:36.530
- Cannes? Who's going to Cannes?
- We are.

06:36.588 --> 06:38.941
I fedexed a print off
to the selection committee last week.

06:39.018 --> 06:40.491
I'm just waiting to hear if we're in.

06:41.482 --> 06:43.450
I thought we agreed
to wait for Sundance.

06:43.550 --> 06:45.298
Fuck the dance.
Been there done that.

06:45.350 --> 06:49.005
I'm going to Cannes and coming home with
a Palme d'Or and a Cote d'Azure tan.

06:49.311 --> 06:51.549
Yesterday you were scared
to death to show us the film.

06:51.626 --> 06:54.103
Now it's ready for the Cannes
without changing a single frame?

06:54.141 --> 06:55.749
You're not as smart as the frogs, suit.

06:55.841 --> 06:57.050
I know they're understand.

06:57.370 --> 06:58.449
This is not your decision.

06:58.572 --> 07:00.810
Yes it fucking is.
I have final cut. You agreed to it.

07:00.868 --> 07:03.649
Which means that I agreed
not to listen to a word you fucking say.

07:03.650 --> 07:05.822
So no notes, not from you,
not ever.

07:06.155 --> 07:08.933
Now, excuse me, I'm gonna go do some
pranayama breathing exercises

07:09.050 --> 07:10.853
and try to forget
this visit ever happened.

07:17.750 --> 07:18.830
Your friend lives here?

07:19.141 --> 07:20.821
Actually, he's a family friend.

07:21.199 --> 07:23.550
But he lets me come use
his private beach whenever I want.

07:23.650 --> 07:26.050
- Oh, nice for you.
- Yeah, he's a great guy.

07:26.526 --> 07:29.532
And he's incredibly cool,
so don't get all charmed by him

07:29.601 --> 07:31.449
and forget that you came here
to hang with me.

07:31.450 --> 07:32.669
How cool could he be?

07:33.277 --> 07:34.750
Do you think Dennis Hopper's cool?

07:35.595 --> 07:36.786
Your friend is dennis hopper?

07:36.820 --> 07:38.877
Yeah, my dad's been his lawyer for,
like, 20 years.

07:38.911 --> 07:40.050
I love Dennis Hopper.

07:41.949 --> 07:44.091
I'm also excited to hang out
with you of course.

07:47.250 --> 07:48.250
You should be.

07:53.433 --> 07:54.450
Yo, E.

07:54.811 --> 07:56.250
I'm at Dennis Hopper's house.

07:56.550 --> 07:58.974
Yeah, well enjoy it now, Vince,
because we got big problems.

07:58.991 --> 08:00.054
What are you talking about?

08:00.089 --> 08:02.403
Walsh submitted the movie
to Cannes without telling us.

08:02.704 --> 08:04.521
Cannes?
What happened to Sundance?

08:04.750 --> 08:08.150
I don't know,he wants a Palme d'Or
or whatever the fuck it's called.

08:09.216 --> 08:10.249
Cannes could be fun.

08:10.250 --> 08:12.549
The movie's not gonna get into Cannes.
It's not ready.

08:12.550 --> 08:14.038
Did you tell Billy what you thought?

08:14.093 --> 08:17.008
I tried to give him my notes.
He basically told me to go fuck myself.

08:17.162 --> 08:18.516
I told you not to upset him.

08:18.687 --> 08:20.676
Upset him?
I'm the one who's upset.

08:20.816 --> 08:22.085
We had the guy for his vision.

08:22.153 --> 08:23.949
What do u say
we just let him do his thing?

08:23.950 --> 08:26.432
The French have
the biggest mouths in the world.

08:26.483 --> 08:28.112
If this movie gets rejected from Cannes,

08:28.197 --> 08:30.190
the whole world is gonna
know the movie sucks.

08:30.241 --> 08:32.280
It doesn't suck.
Would you stop saying that?

08:33.083 --> 08:34.113
Sammy.

08:34.868 --> 08:35.879
Sweetheart.

08:36.030 --> 08:37.765
- I got to go.
- And aquaman.

08:38.565 --> 08:40.535
It's Dennis Hopper, E! I got to go!

08:40.770 --> 08:42.107
Vince, don't hang up on me.

08:43.451 --> 08:44.464
Fuck.

08:44.550 --> 08:46.649
- Hi, how are you, Dennis?
- Hey, great to meet you.

08:46.734 --> 08:47.950
Come on in, come on in.

08:50.711 --> 08:51.980
How does my breath smell?

08:53.150 --> 08:54.349
Like Arnold's ass.

08:54.509 --> 08:55.983
Don't do that shit again.

08:56.205 --> 08:57.799
Don't make me insecure right now.

08:57.950 --> 08:59.869
God made you that way.
Don't blame me.

09:00.144 --> 09:01.550
Ring the doorbell, asshole.

09:05.150 --> 09:06.150
You got gum?

09:06.450 --> 09:09.104
Gum ain't gonna help what you got.
You need a stomach specialist.

09:11.850 --> 09:13.150
Well, hello.

09:15.104 --> 09:18.121
Mom, there's some guys here to see you.

09:24.050 --> 09:26.803
Mom? Just how old
are these broads, Drama?

09:27.094 --> 09:28.750
Don't be an ageist, Turtle.

09:29.397 --> 09:32.929
Besides, rumor had it your girl
gave the best rim job in L.A.

09:33.064 --> 09:35.550
Trust me, you play
your cards right, by 4:00

09:35.744 --> 09:38.450
you'll be sitting
on her face like a bidet.

09:39.350 --> 09:40.919
Hey, Johnny.

09:41.039 --> 09:43.953
Hey, gorgeous, how are you?

09:47.186 --> 09:50.409
Turtle, say hello to the one
and only love of my 20s,

09:50.550 --> 09:52.650
- Miss Donna Deveney?
- Oh, Johnny,

09:52.750 --> 09:54.150
you're still as sweet as ever.

09:56.250 --> 09:57.850
Hey, Turtle.
How's it hanging?

09:58.250 --> 10:00.104
You know, it's hanging.

10:00.292 --> 10:03.823
Hey, margery, get out here,
you fat whore! The boys are here!

10:03.978 --> 10:06.395
Calm your horses, you fat whore!

10:06.543 --> 10:07.898
We always call each other that.

10:08.050 --> 10:09.250
Hey, boys!

10:12.348 --> 10:13.548
You remember Johnny, right?

10:13.650 --> 10:16.590
Sure I do, from the old days.
You sold me coke at bar one.

10:17.685 --> 10:19.502
You must have me mistaken.
I never sold blow.

10:19.570 --> 10:22.466
Maybe I just blew you. Who can remember?
The '90s are such a blur.

10:24.129 --> 10:26.015
This is his friend Turtle.
He's cute, huh?

10:26.888 --> 10:29.253
What do you guys say
we take a couple shots before lunch?

10:29.750 --> 10:31.156
Get a little loose.

10:31.257 --> 10:33.966
Are you kidding?
Loose is our middle name. Right, Turtle?

10:34.069 --> 10:35.097
Let's go.

10:35.417 --> 10:36.446
Let's go.

10:37.633 --> 10:39.250
That's the best rim job in L.A.?

10:39.403 --> 10:41.450
Yeah, just ask Chuck Sheen.

10:44.120 --> 10:48.071
Yes, E, I would say being rejected
by Cannes before we have a distributor

10:48.219 --> 10:49.607
would be a disaster...

10:49.750 --> 10:52.850
One in a series of disasters
orchestrated by you

10:53.050 --> 10:54.850
since you took the reins
of Vince's career.

10:55.050 --> 10:57.025
- So what can we do, Ari?
- Well, let's see.

10:57.150 --> 10:58.656
A, I could give you a hug

10:58.742 --> 11:01.348
and say it's okay that
you destroyed your best friend's career.

11:01.416 --> 11:03.693
Or B, I could have you come in here

11:03.813 --> 11:06.049
and write
on the dry erase-board 500 times,

11:06.352 --> 11:08.246
"I destroyed my best friend's career."

11:08.366 --> 11:09.498
I'd go with b.

11:09.635 --> 11:11.819
- Ari, there's genius in this movie.
- is there?

11:11.939 --> 11:14.449
Walsh won't change a fucking thing.
I got to get rid of him.

11:14.636 --> 11:16.007
Rid of him?
That's your boy.

11:16.227 --> 11:18.950
You gave him final cut
even though I begged you not to.

11:19.296 --> 11:22.210
<I>Now you're going to have to
live with it or kill him.</I>

11:22.350 --> 11:24.550
Actually, that's a good idea.
why don't you kill him,

11:24.650 --> 11:26.050
then kill yourself?

11:26.250 --> 11:28.650
Could you imagine the outpouring
of love and sympathy

11:28.750 --> 11:30.050
when Vince loses both of you?

11:30.550 --> 11:32.373
I can have him back
on top in three months.

11:32.450 --> 11:33.749
You owe him that much.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.049
All right, look.
The only way to get rid of Walsh

11:37.154 --> 11:40.550
is to sell the movie to someone
who won't release his cut

11:40.738 --> 11:43.667
but no one could sell a shitty movie.
Well, maybe I could.

11:43.735 --> 11:46.530
But no one could sell a shitty movie
no one's seen a fucking frame of.

11:46.599 --> 11:48.107
What about a great trailer?

11:48.350 --> 11:49.750
Could you sell a great trailer?

11:50.607 --> 11:51.721
How great?

11:51.979 --> 11:53.705
- Great house.
- Oh, thanks.

11:54.650 --> 11:56.524
I'm sure you have a few just like it.

11:57.179 --> 11:59.950
No actually,
right now I'm sort of homeless.

12:01.850 --> 12:04.382
Well, there's no better way
to find out who you are

12:04.550 --> 12:07.082
and what you're made out
of than living in the great outdoors.

12:07.133 --> 12:11.250
I did 16 months in a cave on <I>Apocalypse</I>,

12:11.350 --> 12:13.076
and let me just tell you that

12:14.190 --> 12:17.344
God is the finest
decorator I've ever had.

12:19.621 --> 12:21.353
So what's the scor guys?

12:21.950 --> 12:23.149
Still 0-0.

12:23.244 --> 12:25.661
We call it nil-nil, chucky, in soccer.

12:27.050 --> 12:28.498
You follow soccer, Aquaman?

12:28.692 --> 12:31.298
- Not really.
- Oh, great sport.

12:31.366 --> 12:35.565
Pele turned me on to it back in the day
when we were chasing honeys together.

12:36.350 --> 12:37.530
The great thing is,

12:37.650 --> 12:40.457
no american bookie knows
shit about handicapping.

12:40.652 --> 12:43.669
We've got a million bucks
riding on Manchester United.

12:44.549 --> 12:46.850
You want a part of the bet?
You can ve 100k of mine.

12:47.136 --> 12:50.350
It makes watching the game
a lot more interesting and

12:50.750 --> 12:51.762
it's a lock.

12:51.850 --> 12:54.064
Actually, I was gonna take
Vince down to the beach.

12:54.280 --> 12:56.649
If you would rather
lay on the beach with the girls

12:56.650 --> 12:59.050
than gamble with the men,
I guess that's okay.

12:59.250 --> 13:00.369
You know, maybe we can

13:00.970 --> 13:03.669
hang with the guys for a little bit,
if that's all right with you.

13:04.050 --> 13:06.250
Besides, we do have
all night together, don't we?

13:07.650 --> 13:09.714
Is that your way of saying
you'll make it up to me?

13:10.284 --> 13:11.350
I'll certainly try.

13:12.150 --> 13:13.960
All right, let's watch the game.

13:14.413 --> 13:15.449
I'm in.

13:15.546 --> 13:17.706
Now that's the spirit
that I'm talking about.

13:17.826 --> 13:19.438
Now if somebody would get their ass up

13:19.558 --> 13:22.009
and give our super friend
here a couple of seats...

13:23.050 --> 13:24.083
There you go.

13:24.621 --> 13:25.669
Thank you.

13:25.926 --> 13:26.937
All right.

13:37.529 --> 13:39.175
I love latin men in uniform.

13:39.350 --> 13:41.765
- See? Gay joe public.
- I resent that.

13:41.850 --> 13:43.385
Who cares what the movie looks like?

13:43.470 --> 13:46.779
- Good trailer, sexy cast, boom!
- So what do you think?

13:46.950 --> 13:48.949
I think I can sell it.
I can sell it for a lot.

13:49.110 --> 13:50.773
- To who?
- Harvey.

13:50.950 --> 13:52.904
He's been tracking
this thing since day one.

13:53.153 --> 13:55.056
- He hates us.
- He's a businessman,

13:55.150 --> 13:58.849
not your prom date who still holds a
grudge 'cause you didn't fuck her right.

13:58.850 --> 14:01.263
We'll be fine. We'll go in there
with our hat in our hands.

14:01.450 --> 14:03.613
Vince will show him
his $50-million smile.

14:03.850 --> 14:04.881
Harvey will bite.

14:05.550 --> 14:07.679
- I don't think Vince is gonna wanna go.
- Why not?

14:07.850 --> 14:09.960
He and I kind of have
different views on the movie.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.890
- Different how?
- Well, he likes it.

14:13.550 --> 14:14.617
He likes it?

14:14.891 --> 14:16.160
Vince likes the movie?

14:16.526 --> 14:18.775
- Then why the fuck are you here?
- Because he's wrong.

14:18.850 --> 14:21.565
I don't know if he's brainwashed or
scared to not back his director,

14:21.599 --> 14:22.618
but he's wrong.

14:22.669 --> 14:24.795
- Did you talk to him about this?
- I spoke to him.

14:24.907 --> 14:26.750
- He hung up on me.
- He hung up on you?

14:27.250 --> 14:29.230
Well, I'm hanging up on you in person.

14:29.298 --> 14:31.513
Let me explain something you.
I have two philosophies:

14:31.582 --> 14:32.949
A, my client is always right,

14:33.000 --> 14:37.458
b, his manager is always
an overpaid useless pain in the ass.

14:37.578 --> 14:39.497
Yeah, my two philosophies
one, you're a dick,

14:39.532 --> 14:42.310
and two, when you realize I'm right,
you're gonna know you're a dick.

14:42.362 --> 14:44.049
Forget it,
I'll take care of this myself.

14:44.219 --> 14:45.847
I'll see you later.
Bye, Lloyd.

14:46.973 --> 14:51.019
Jeez, there was such positive energy
in this room just a few moments ago.

14:56.087 --> 14:58.150
Turtle, you remind me
of one of my son's friends.

14:58.950 --> 15:00.589
Yeah, I got a familiar face.

15:01.153 --> 15:03.107
Well, it's not your face
I'm interested in.

15:03.312 --> 15:04.546
Why don't you walk ahead of me

15:04.650 --> 15:07.350
so I can see what kind
of junk you got in your trunk?

15:08.553 --> 15:10.255
Actually,
my mother always taught me

15:10.324 --> 15:12.038
it's impolite
to walk in front of a woman.

15:12.946 --> 15:15.174
We got a shy one here, Donna!

15:15.350 --> 15:17.613
Well, he's a Turtle.
He'll come out of his shell.

15:17.763 --> 15:20.149
- Good one, Donna.
- I'll tell you what, Turtle,

15:20.376 --> 15:23.359
you can check out my heinie for now
and show me yours later.

15:27.181 --> 15:29.750
You are in for one wild afternoon, pal.

15:32.650 --> 15:34.759
So when you say
I have no money, Marvin,

15:34.950 --> 15:36.117
what do you really mean?

15:36.323 --> 15:38.140
I mean you are busted, Vince.

15:38.650 --> 15:40.285
Your balance is zero.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.115
<I>You're living off of your
american express card, got it?</I>

15:44.971 --> 15:46.823
What the fuck does "hmm" mean?

15:47.614 --> 15:49.277
Hey, want to take a walk?

15:49.594 --> 15:51.051
Just one moment please.

15:52.153 --> 15:53.150
Thank you.

15:54.650 --> 15:57.573
All right, don't tell Eric,
because I don't want him nagging me,

15:58.350 --> 16:00.273
but I may need you
to stake me 100 grand.

16:00.397 --> 16:01.750
100 grand? For what?

16:02.155 --> 16:04.060
I kind of went in
on a bet with Dennis Hopper

16:04.112 --> 16:05.603
on Manchester United
and we're down.

16:05.713 --> 16:08.148
Are you out of your mind?
What do you know about soccer?

16:08.326 --> 16:09.783
Get the fuck out of there!

16:09.835 --> 16:11.772
I already placed the bet,
I can't just walk out.

16:11.806 --> 16:14.258
Bullshit!
You put one foot in front of the other

16:14.350 --> 16:15.450
<I>and move them.</I>

16:15.482 --> 16:17.749
Hold on. I'm getting a call
that may make me some money.

16:18.275 --> 16:19.320
Hey, Ari, what's up?

16:19.350 --> 16:21.906
Do you know that your man broke out
of the oompa loompa factory

16:22.009 --> 16:23.209
and is up to no good?

16:23.243 --> 16:24.529
What do you mean?

16:27.850 --> 16:29.250
Hi, Eric Murphy for Harvey.

16:30.220 --> 16:32.434
You can have a seat.
I'll let him know you're here.

16:38.942 --> 16:40.777
Did you tell Ari the movie sucked?

16:40.813 --> 16:41.825
Yeah, I did.

16:41.950 --> 16:43.700
I'm having a hard enough day as it is.

16:43.717 --> 16:45.809
I thought we agreed
you weren't gonna be negative.

16:45.877 --> 16:48.177
I didn't agree to anything, all right?
You hung up on me.

16:48.212 --> 16:49.737
I'm not being negative but realistic.

16:49.823 --> 16:52.412
- The movie needs work.
- Since when did you become a filmmaker?

16:52.463 --> 16:54.483
- What's that mean?
- It means you're new to this.

16:54.508 --> 16:57.449
You don't know what to look for in
a first cut, much less how to fix one.

16:57.450 --> 16:58.912
So my opinion doesn't count?

16:59.282 --> 17:00.876
When you were managing your restaurant,

17:00.927 --> 17:03.444
what did you think when a customer
told you how to do your job?

17:03.512 --> 17:05.972
Oh, please. You did not
just seriously just fucking say that.

17:06.022 --> 17:08.646
I'm the producer of this movie.
I deserve to be heard.

17:08.698 --> 17:11.252
Is that what this is about? Your ego?
You're not feeling heard?

17:11.349 --> 17:13.111
Fuck you.
I put my own money into this.

17:13.162 --> 17:14.946
Yeah, and now what?
You're panicking.

17:15.259 --> 17:17.470
I'll buy you out right now
if you don't believe in it.

17:17.505 --> 17:18.722
You're broke, big shot.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.232
I got something in the works.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.492
Eric, harvey will see you now.

17:25.483 --> 17:26.849
Yeah, me too.

17:27.450 --> 17:28.951
E, don't hang up on me.

17:29.539 --> 17:31.629
- Are you ready?
- Yes, how are you today?

17:31.714 --> 17:33.545
- I'm okay. How are you?
- Nice to meet you.

17:34.745 --> 17:36.586
Check out how long my tongue is.

17:38.557 --> 17:40.031
We might have a record holding here.

17:40.346 --> 17:42.780
Well, it's good for those
hard-to-reach places.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.548
Well if anyone's got
hard-to-reach places, it's Turtle.

17:46.533 --> 17:47.699
He's kidding me.

17:48.150 --> 17:49.888
Oh, too bad.

17:50.050 --> 17:52.350
What do you guys say
we get out of here and go fuck?

17:52.732 --> 17:54.720
I say "check please!"

17:54.950 --> 17:56.650
- What...
- I'm gonna go freshen up.

17:57.009 --> 17:58.650
- Okay.
- I'll go with you.

18:00.683 --> 18:03.357
I'm out of here, Drama. There's no way
I'm fucking that old lady.

18:03.520 --> 18:06.234
How would you like it if someone
talked about your mother like that?

18:06.320 --> 18:08.308
If my mother was out
chasing guys half her age

18:08.450 --> 18:10.250
or two-thirds her age,
she'd deserve it.

18:10.570 --> 18:12.388
Look, you can't bail on me.
I need you here.

18:12.450 --> 18:15.350
The only way I'm gonna get donna alone
is if you keep margery busy.

18:15.611 --> 18:18.877
Get her a deck of cards and some friends
to play mahjong with because I'm gone.

18:18.963 --> 18:21.850
Come on! 16 years I've been dying
to bang this broad.

18:22.150 --> 18:23.250
Take one for the team,

18:23.350 --> 18:26.450
like I did for you that time you set me
up with a girl with the club foot.

18:26.636 --> 18:28.950
At least that girl was
a nine from the ankles up.

18:29.197 --> 18:31.950
Come on,Turtle, don't leave.
I'm begging you, please.

18:32.950 --> 18:34.940
Fine, all right,
but you owe me for life.

18:35.026 --> 18:36.689
Yes, I owe you for life.

18:41.105 --> 18:42.956
Are we still gonna split
this down the middle?

18:46.950 --> 18:49.042
Our last meeting
at Sundance was unpleasant.

18:49.250 --> 18:50.785
Yeah, a little bit.

18:50.921 --> 18:52.950
Well, I tend to get
overexcited sometimes.

18:55.403 --> 18:56.551
You did fuck me though.

18:56.993 --> 18:58.330
And I have to apologize for that.

18:58.382 --> 19:00.662
Yeah, no, you really fucked me.
I thought we had a deal.

19:00.750 --> 19:02.773
- Again, I'm sorry.
- I fuck people.

19:03.449 --> 19:06.123
- I don't like getting fucked.
- No one does.

19:06.543 --> 19:07.623
You're not trying

19:08.647 --> 19:09.850
to fuck me again here?

19:09.950 --> 19:11.686
No no.
no no no.

19:12.350 --> 19:15.150
Because I've been following <I>Medellin</I>

19:15.750 --> 19:16.750
for a long time

19:16.850 --> 19:19.838
and I've heard some not such great
things from inside sources.

19:19.915 --> 19:21.955
I don't know what inside source
you have, but...

19:22.075 --> 19:24.440
You'll never know.
That's why they call them inside source.

19:24.550 --> 19:26.033
I know there's a great movie in here.

19:26.136 --> 19:27.696
I was there.
I know what we shot

19:27.850 --> 19:29.549
but this guy Walsh needs to be recut.

19:29.701 --> 19:32.513
I know you're the guy that can bring
the brilliance out of this movie.

19:32.850 --> 19:33.950
I want you to look at this.

19:34.050 --> 19:36.180
You'll get a better idea
of what we're talking about.

19:36.250 --> 19:37.756
You wanna get rid of your director?

19:38.450 --> 19:40.240
- I do.
- My kind of producer.

19:43.550 --> 19:45.050
Put that up on the big screen.

19:45.450 --> 19:46.869
We'll look at it together now.

19:50.204 --> 19:52.330
We're looking good, Aquaman.
we're looking good.

19:52.446 --> 19:54.949
I don't know. We're down by one
with less than a minute to go.

19:54.950 --> 19:56.949
Yeah, but we got
a penalty kick coming up.

19:57.182 --> 19:59.513
Man u's got the best
penalty kickers in the game.

19:59.668 --> 20:01.690
- Best in the game.
- We're going into overtime.

20:01.850 --> 20:04.566
Trust me, I am never wrong.
am I ever wrong, guys?

20:04.696 --> 20:07.096
Never wrong.
Not about soccer.

20:07.350 --> 20:09.494
- Not about movies.
- Not about financial services.

20:09.597 --> 20:12.350
Okay, now shut the fuck up.
everybody quiet. Here it comes.

20:16.556 --> 20:19.450
- Fuck!
- Oh man, he guessed right.

20:23.650 --> 20:27.050
Well, it's only money,
right, Aquaman?

20:27.851 --> 20:29.017
Yeah, Dennis,

20:29.550 --> 20:31.779
about that.
When are you gonna need the money?

20:31.850 --> 20:33.249
Because I didn't bring any cash...

20:33.379 --> 20:34.630
What's with all the noise?

20:34.950 --> 20:36.199
You guys woke me up.

20:36.450 --> 20:38.831
Manchester just fucking lost.

20:39.773 --> 20:41.145
- They did?
- Yeah.

20:41.350 --> 20:43.490
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah, shit's right.

20:43.576 --> 20:44.793
No, Dennis.

20:45.350 --> 20:46.950
I forgot to call in the bets.

20:47.320 --> 20:48.349
Really?

20:48.448 --> 20:50.749
Then I guess we all just caught
a lucky break!

20:55.171 --> 20:58.206
So you want to take a walk down
to the beach now, Vince?

20:58.343 --> 21:00.811
I would love to take
a walk down to the beach.

21:01.650 --> 21:04.080
Hey, Aquaman,
Brazil is playing next.

21:04.629 --> 21:06.874
They are a lock.
Now are you in?

21:08.650 --> 21:09.650
Definitely.

21:10.050 --> 21:11.650
All right, that's my man.

21:12.746 --> 21:16.020
Lordy lordy,
she hasn't aged an inch.

21:16.250 --> 21:17.450
Hey, boys.

21:19.450 --> 21:21.644
You know there's no way
I can do this, right, Drama?

21:22.270 --> 21:24.150
Yeah, I get it, Turtle.
you don't have to.

21:24.450 --> 21:27.050
Just sit there and hold your dick
and don't fuck it up for me.

21:28.009 --> 21:29.294
All right.

21:29.950 --> 21:31.850
Oh yeah, you sexy thing.

21:36.958 --> 21:38.226
Actually, Johnny,

21:38.328 --> 21:41.378
Margery and I were talking,
and we thought we'd mix things up a bit.

21:41.550 --> 21:43.289
Mix things up a bit how?

21:46.150 --> 21:48.356
I thought I reminded you
of your son's friend.

21:48.647 --> 21:50.601
Yeah, the one I always
wanted to fuck.

21:51.281 --> 21:52.464
You got to be shitting me.

21:52.536 --> 21:54.549
I'm sorry, Johnny.
you know I like my boys young.

21:54.550 --> 21:56.050
And you just aren't so anymore.

21:56.697 --> 21:57.950
Oh, let them go, honey.

22:00.367 --> 22:02.450
You're in for the best afternoon

22:03.233 --> 22:04.399
of your life!

22:08.950 --> 22:10.571
We have almost the same blood.

22:11.750 --> 22:13.050
How did my life go so wrong?

22:13.984 --> 22:16.050
Genetic mutations can be so cruel.

22:21.650 --> 22:23.253
- This is Sam.
- Hey Sam.

22:23.850 --> 22:25.934
- When you get a second, can we talk?
- Sure.

22:26.131 --> 22:27.366
Thanks.

22:28.634 --> 22:30.126
I think I'm in trouble.

22:31.350 --> 22:32.396
I'll be right back.

22:32.499 --> 22:34.213
So. How was the day, boys?

22:34.350 --> 22:36.749
Well, Drama's got
the cleanest asshole in America

22:36.903 --> 22:39.183
and I learned that
passion begins after 40.

22:39.421 --> 22:41.839
- So I'd say it was a pretty good day.
- It sounds like it.

22:42.250 --> 22:43.350
Yo, what's up?

22:45.086 --> 22:46.346
Can you guys give us a minute?

22:46.950 --> 22:48.924
- It's my house, E.
- Johnny.

22:49.600 --> 22:50.729
Yeah, sure, bro.

22:50.861 --> 22:53.415
Yeah, who knows? Maybe I'll even
take a girl from you this time.

22:53.449 --> 22:55.627
- because I am on a hot streak.
- Shut up.

22:55.936 --> 22:58.532
Yeah, this ain't a house.
It's a condo and it ain't a big one.

23:00.050 --> 23:01.100
So you're mad at me?

23:01.250 --> 23:03.512
- You called me pizza boy.
- No, I didn't.

23:03.650 --> 23:05.833
Yeah, you did.
You called me pizza boy just like Ari.

23:06.450 --> 23:09.017
I was pissed.
I was down 100 grand on a soccer game.

23:09.250 --> 23:11.393
- What?
- Yeah, don't worry. I got it all back.

23:11.743 --> 23:14.822
- And I won $100,000 on Brazil.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

23:14.950 --> 23:15.984
No,

23:16.150 --> 23:18.363
Come on.
You wanna hit the palm for lobbies?

23:19.750 --> 23:21.550
Come on, it's a good day.

23:21.750 --> 23:23.950
- No it's not. I'm pissed.
- I'm sorry.

23:24.350 --> 23:25.949
You know what?
Don't give me that shit.

23:25.950 --> 23:28.549
You know, you tell me
I'm not a filmmaker, and that's fine.

23:28.550 --> 23:30.458
But you know what?
I found the script.

23:30.550 --> 23:32.864
You didn't and Ari didn't.
I picked the director.

23:33.150 --> 23:35.277
And I got somebody to buy this movie

23:35.337 --> 23:37.250
and bail us out
of our financial problems.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.650
- What do you mean?
- I brought it to Harvey.

23:40.226 --> 23:43.050
He wants it, Vince.
I got him to make us an offer.

23:43.403 --> 23:45.863
$25 million.
It takes final cut away from Billy.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.378
It's what's best for us
and it's what's best for the movie.

23:48.463 --> 23:49.698
- You got an offer?
- Yeah.

23:49.783 --> 23:51.138
And if we get rejected from Cannes

23:51.189 --> 23:53.724
and that goes public we may
never get an offer like that again.

23:53.758 --> 23:55.108
You got an offer off a trailer?

23:57.838 --> 23:59.346
That is amazing.

23:59.746 --> 24:01.450
Yeah, I can spin some dough, huh?

24:01.700 --> 24:02.750
Look, E,

24:03.209 --> 24:04.946
I know you're doing
what you think is best,

24:05.049 --> 24:06.709
and I was wrong
about what I said today.

24:06.950 --> 24:09.656
And I do appreciate how much
you really have done. I really do.

24:10.250 --> 24:12.050
But is it possible you're wrong too?

24:12.450 --> 24:13.709
- How?
- About the movie.

24:13.859 --> 24:16.121
Maybe you really are too close.
Is that possible?

24:17.150 --> 24:20.150
Maybe, but I'd like to be protected
in case we don't get into Cannes.

24:20.470 --> 24:21.739
We did get into Cannes.

24:22.186 --> 24:23.197
What?

24:23.250 --> 24:25.906
The movie got into Cannes.
I just talked to Walsh an hour ago.

24:26.250 --> 24:28.771
- I don't believe it.
- Well, believe it, because you made...

24:28.874 --> 24:30.606
We made a great film.

24:30.750 --> 24:33.339
A film I don't think we should
sell until we get to the festival.

24:33.407 --> 24:34.513
We got into Cannes?

24:34.880 --> 24:36.250
Maybe you should watch it again.

24:36.583 --> 24:37.650
Maybe.
