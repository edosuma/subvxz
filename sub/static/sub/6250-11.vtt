Well, I heard
there’s an 80-foot-tall

00:11.804 --> 00:15.547
Uh-huh.

No, numb-nuts.

And after 15 years,
they still remember him.

01:06.484 --> 01:08.349
They named their lab

Well, you were incorrect.

01:11.197 --> 01:13.233
Is there

Yes.

is the light visible?

something about refraction.

that the angle of incidence...

07:16.186 --> 07:19.178
These weren’t cremated. The bones would be
drier and the ﬂesh would
be completely gone.

07:19.273 --> 07:23.232
Meaning that the burn was hotter than
a wood fire and cooler than a crematorium.

07:23.319 --> 07:26.777
- That’s a thousand-degree range.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.451

11:11.380 --> 11:13.291
Mad skills, babe.

11:14.842 --> 11:17.333
The landlord said
that Cal Warren
worked crazy hours.

11:17.427 --> 11:19.338
You know,
he kept to himself.

11:19.429 --> 11:21.340
Every time the landlord
asked him,

11:21.431 --> 11:24.013
you know, what he did
fora iii/mg he always
dodged the question.

11:24.142 --> 11:28.101
Maybe he liked his privacy.
What? So much that he pays
his rent In cash?

11:29.147 --> 11:31.399
I don’t know, Bones.
Something is weird.

11:31.525 --> 11:33.516
It’s not right.

11:33.610 --> 11:37.068
No photographs.
Not even a bill.

11:38.115 --> 11:40.197
So did you persuade Cam
to fire Max?

11:40.284 --> 11:43.526
What? You think my dad
should be allowed to work
at theJeffersonian?

11:43.620 --> 11:46.111

11:46.206 --> 11:49.323

Hmm. It’s an RF.

12:15.944 --> 12:19.732
And that would be—
Basically, it’s
a super—fancy key card.

12:19.823 --> 12:21.734
You wave the card
in front ofthe reader,

12:21.825 --> 12:24.362

and the door opens.

12:24.453 --> 12:26.660
Any way to figure out
what door it opens?

12:26.747 --> 12:30.660
Well, ifthe info
on the card isn’t
too heavily encrypted.

12:30.751 --> 12:33.868
I heard you tried
to get Hod gins interested
in doing an experiment.

Welcome to the Woodbury School,
Agent Booth.
Hi. How are you?

13:19.675 --> 13:21.961
What’s with
all the security?
It’s precautionary.

13:22.052 --> 13:26.466
Our student body includes

How old is your child?

13:28.558 --> 13:30.549
Parker? Oh, he’s seven.

13:30.686 --> 13:32.927
Has he been evaluated?
He doesjust fine.

13:33.021 --> 13:36.104
Well, most

an educational consultant.

13:36.233 --> 13:39.100
I mean, it’s not a requirement,
of course, but—
Mr. Donnegan,

13:39.236 --> 13:43.229
I think you got this all wrong.
I know it seems crazy,
but given the demand,

13:43.323 --> 13:46.486
we can only accept
the most qualified
applicants.

13:46.576 --> 13:49.033
Oh, Parker’s a great kid.

13:49.121 --> 13:51.578
The problem is keeping him
that way, isn’t it?

13:51.665 --> 13:55.078
Sixty-eight percent
of our students matriculate
to Ivy League universities,

13:55.168 --> 13:58.660

of our electron microscope
or AP. classes.

He offered Cal 2,500 a week.

That’s very good pa y
for a babysitter.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.891

to check out a new horse.

the King children
up for a ride.

- A ride?
- I’m a pilot.

19:48.813 --> 19:52.681
Cal got sick, and
well, the boys thought
that was hilarious.

19:52.776 --> 19:56.769
You wouldn’t happen to know how
Cal Warren got a prescription
for painkillers from you?

19:56.863 --> 19:58.728
Oh. Isn’t that obvious?

19:58.823 --> 20:03.783
That’s why he brought Royce K/ng
to me to be stitched up—

20:03.870 --> 20:06.452
to steal my prescription pad.

20:07.665 --> 20:09.280
Right. I have no further questions.

20:09.376 --> 20:11.287
So, you know,
thanks for coming in.

20:11.378 --> 20:13.994
I just feel stupid
for not being able to put
the face with the name.

20:14.130 --> 20:17.588
I’m so sorry
for wasting your time.
No worries. Have a nice day.

20:19.969 --> 20:22.221
Hey. So you know
that thing where
you insist...

20:22.305 --> 20:24.591
that all information
goes through you?

20:24.682 --> 20:26.889
Yes, and I’m afraid
I’m immovable on the subject.

20:26.976 --> 20:29.809
And you send out little e-mails
summarizing the case so far?

20:29.896 --> 20:32.478
Yes. Plus, I check
those e-mails to see
ifthey’ve been opened.

20:32.607 --> 20:34.472
That’s a very good system.
[Beeps]

20:34.609 --> 20:36.565
Thank you.
Because ifyou weren’t
checking,

20:36.653 --> 20:38.564
I probably never
would’ve read the e-mail...

20:38.655 --> 20:40.566
that said Booth questioned
a flying dermatologist.

20:40.657 --> 20:43.023
I hope you’re not trying
to get some free lotion.

20:43.118 --> 20:45.450
I ran the accelerant samples
through the 6C. mass spec.

20:45.578 --> 20:49.241
There were traces
of tetraethyl lead.
Have we changed the subject?

20:49.332 --> 20:51.744
No. Because ifyou
hadn’t been so anal
about the e-mails,

20:51.835 --> 20:53.700
I never would’ve known
that I discovered
something...

20:53.837 --> 20:58.297
that wasn’t merely interesting,
but vital to the investigation.
Which is tetraethyl lead?

20:58.383 --> 21:01.250
Tetraethyl lead was a common
anti-knock additive
in gasoline...

21:01.344 --> 21:04.131
that went out
with catalytic converters
and unleaded gas.

21:04.264 --> 21:07.051
Does the ﬂying dermatologist
drive a vintage car?
Maybe.

21:07.142 --> 21:09.474
But for sure, the flying
dermatologist flies a plane.

21:09.561 --> 21:11.222
Aviation gas?

21:11.312 --> 21:14.475
The victim’s remains were
incinerated by aviation gas.

21:14.566 --> 21:16.477
I’ll let Booth know.
[Beeping]

21:16.568 --> 21:19.059
Hopefully she hasn’t flown
the coop while you were
getting to the point.

21:20.155 --> 21:22.362
I wasjust trying to be nice.

21:28.329 --> 21:30.240
- You lied to me.
- Yes.

21:30.331 --> 21:32.583
I wrote Cal
a prescription
for painkillers.

21:32.667 --> 21:34.623
/ shou/dn ’t ha ve.

21:34.711 --> 21:36.952
- That’s the truth.
- Well, not this time, Doc.

21:37.046 --> 21:39.298
Now that I know that
you’re a world-class liar,

21:39.382 --> 21:43.045
I camejust a little bit more
prepared this time.

21:43.136 --> 21:44.751
Take a look at those there.

21:44.888 --> 21:46.970
My flight logs.
Mm-hmm.

21:47.098 --> 21:49.180
For the past year.
Yeah. Hmm.

21:49.267 --> 21:51.849
Oh, lookee there.
This one here.

21:51.936 --> 21:53.767
Right here.

21:53.855 --> 21:56.517
Yes. I took Cal
flying a few times.

21:56.608 --> 21:58.724
Mm-hmm. Without the kids?

21:58.818 --> 22:01.104
This one here is my a vorite—

22:01.196 --> 22:03.232
this particular flight
to New York.

22:05.658 --> 22:08.274
You were gone
the whole weekend.

22:11.831 --> 22:13.822
All right.

22:13.917 --> 22:15.999
All right. I’ll tell you
what you want to know.

22:16.085 --> 22:19.498
No. My husband didn’t know
I was having an affair
with the Kings’ manny.

22:19.589 --> 22:22.626
Would I have killed Cal
to prevent him
from finding out?

22:22.717 --> 22:26.335
No. I would not.

22:26.429 --> 22:30.923
Why? Because my husband
doesn’t give a damn
who I boff.

22:32.227 --> 22:34.434
Do I know anyone else
who might wish Cal ill?

22:34.521 --> 22:37.513
Yes. Richard King.

22:37.607 --> 22:40.895
Don’t stop. This— This is great.
Keep going.

22:40.985 --> 22:43.601
Cal told me to sell a stock.

22:43.696 --> 22:47.405
He said he had some
insider knowledge that
this company was in trouble.

22:47.492 --> 22:49.483
I took the tip,
made a killing.

22:49.577 --> 22:51.784
That’s when I flew him
to New York
to say thank you.

22:51.871 --> 22:56.035
And he said,
“You’re welcome”—
all weekend.

22:56.125 --> 22:59.458
[Chuckles ] What does this
have to do with Richard King?

23:01.130 --> 23:03.462
It was Richard King’s
company.

23:11.683 --> 23:14.891
How’s that look, Max?
Good. It looks good.

23:14.978 --> 23:16.934
I never thought
I’d be doing
another experiment.

23:17.021 --> 23:18.932
Dad, what are you
doing in here?

23:19.023 --> 23:20.934
Max had a great idea
for an experiment.

23:21.025 --> 23:23.402
Dad, you said you
wouldn’t touch evidence.

23:23.486 --> 23:26.649
Uh, he’s been very careful
not to touch the evidence,
Dr. Brennan.

23:26.739 --> 23:29.321
You know, your old man—
he reminded me why
/ got In to science.

23:29.409 --> 23:33.493
- To catch murderers?
- No. To figure stuffout
in amusing ways.

23:33.580 --> 23:36.663
The bones were incmerated
by a Wat/on fuel

23:36.749 --> 23:39.456
Theyjust need to know
how strong the wind was.
Basic.

23:39.544 --> 23:41.660
So figure out how big
a wind blew the bones.

23:41.754 --> 23:45.918
- Check the weather charts.
- [ Max] Basic. That’s very basic.

23:46.009 --> 23:48.842
But this is the same
wind tunnel you helped me
build for the science fair.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.668
Yeah.
A basic wind tunnel, honey.

23:50.763 --> 23:52.754
You won first pr/ze.

23:52.849 --> 23:55.761
I made casts that weigh
the same as the bones
we found in that tree.

23:55.893 --> 24:00.227
[Hodgins] Now we put the skull
cast into the wind tunnel,
[Power Humming]

24:00.315 --> 24:02.977
since that was the largest
artifact on the tree.

24:04.152 --> 24:06.564
I didn’t touch anything.
[Beeping]

24:06.654 --> 24:11.068
The bone begins to move
at wind speeds of
42 miles per hour.

24:11.159 --> 24:14.196
Not enough net force to
achieve aerodynamic lift.
[Wind Whooshing]

24:14.287 --> 24:17.871
But crank it to 69—

24:21.252 --> 24:24.836
- [Giggles]
- I checked
the National Weather Service.

24:24.922 --> 24:26.708
There were windstorms
In that area last week

24:26.799 --> 24:30.758
A strong nor’easter
hit 71 miles per hour
late last Tuesday.

24:30.845 --> 24:34.133
That gives us a 48-hour wmdow
for Calvin Warren ’s murder.

24:34.223 --> 24:37.215
But we still don’t know where he was killed
or where the body was dumped.

24:37.310 --> 24:39.767
- Wait a minute. I can figure that out.
- Dad, you’re fired.

24:39.854 --> 24:44.723
- What?
- The National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration.

24:44.859 --> 24:46.599
NOAA tracks
surface conditions.
Yeah.

24:46.694 --> 24:48.855
So we can calculate where
the bones started out,

24:48.946 --> 24:50.857
if we can plot
approximate mass...

24:50.948 --> 24:52.939
and reverse the path
ofthat nor’easter wind.

24:53.034 --> 24:56.822
The hea vier rema/ns will 507/ be
near the or/g/na/ dump site.

24:56.913 --> 25:00.701
- You see? I’m helping.
- Oh, most definitely
is helping.

25:00.792 --> 25:02.748
I’m sorry, Dad,
but you’re fired.

25:02.835 --> 25:04.826
You took part
in a forensic experiment.

25:04.921 --> 25:06.832
You said you wouldn’t,
but you did!

25:06.923 --> 25:10.086
- So now you’re fired.
- Dr. Brennan, he didn’t
touch any ofthe evidence.

25:10.176 --> 25:12.417
It’s okay, kid.

25:12.512 --> 25:14.503
Never mind.

25:18.810 --> 25:22.428
[Boy]
Nice assist, Nick
Now cage h/m out, quick

25:22.522 --> 25:25.889
[ Boy #2 ]
He ’5 open.
Pass it! Pass it!

25:25.983 --> 25:28.144
Hi, Alexa.
How are you?

25:28.236 --> 25:31.399
Shouldn’t you be, like,
studying algebra or Chinese
or solving the world’s problems?

25:31.489 --> 25:34.652
I’m cheering for Royce.
He’s the goalie.

25:34.742 --> 25:37.279
[Man]
60! Go!

25:37.370 --> 25:39.577
I watch football.
It’s a better sport.
It’s American.

25:39.664 --> 25:41.871
Lacrosse was invented
by the American Indian.

25:41.958 --> 25:43.949
You can’t get much
more American than that.

25:45.837 --> 25:48.829
- Hi.
- Oh, God. What now?

25:48.923 --> 25:50.788
Well, I’mjust thinking about
this whole insider trading thing.

25:50.883 --> 25:54.091
- I told you everything.
- I’m thinking, Cal, you know,
gives you a tip on a stock.

25:54.178 --> 25:57.466
You sell it. You make two,
three million dollars, and
it raises questions in my mind.

25:57.557 --> 26:02.096
Ho w did Richard King
ﬁnd out that Cal spilled
Insider kno w/edge?

26:02.186 --> 26:04.973
- That’s right, Bones.
- I don’t know.

26:05.064 --> 26:08.431
Well, where were you
between last Sunday
and Tuesday night?

26:08.526 --> 26:11.893
- Who is she?
- Don’t getjealous, Doc.
Just answer the question.

26:11.988 --> 26:17.073
I was in San Antonio doing
skin grafts on a firefighter
with third-degree burns.

26:17.160 --> 26:19.867
- You’ve got your own plane.
- You had time to fly back.

26:19.954 --> 26:23.117
You really want me to believe
that Richard King killed Cal?

26:23.207 --> 26:26.040
Cal Warren’s remains
were incinerated
with aviation gas.

26:26.127 --> 26:28.743
- I didn’t kill Cal.
- You know what?
She lies a lot.

26:28.838 --> 26:31.580
- I don’t think she can help it at all.
- This is my lawyer’s card.

26:31.716 --> 26:33.627
Hmm.
She’s decided
not to cooperate.

26:33.718 --> 26:37.506
No, I’ve decided to watch
my son play lacrosse.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.088
Okay Here’s the surface weather
for Tuesday night,

26:41.100 --> 26:43.512
Okay Here’s the surface weather
for Tuesday night,

26:43.603 --> 26:46.390
when that nor’easter blew
the bones into that tree.

26:46.481 --> 26:49.939
Now that red “X”—
that’s the tree.

26:50.067 --> 26:52.524
Mm-hmm.
The bones must’ve
traveled...

26:52.612 --> 26:55.979
along this vector.

26:56.073 --> 26:59.031
Now given the duration
of the gusts
and the terra/n obstacles,

26:59.118 --> 27:02.281
liftoffmust’ve happened
somewhere between here...

27:02.371 --> 27:04.327
and here.

27:04.415 --> 27:08.374
That’s on the edge of
Queen Anne’s and Kent County.

27:08.503 --> 27:11.370
Good job.
Excellent experiment.
Don’t thank me.

27:11.464 --> 27:13.204
Thank Max Brennan.

27:20.139 --> 27:22.596
How’s it going there, Max?

27:22.683 --> 27:24.594
It’s the last day
with my kids this afternoon.

27:24.727 --> 27:27.309
I’m toast.
Cam fired you?

27:27.396 --> 27:29.648
No, no.
Tempe fired me.

27:29.732 --> 27:31.848
And don’t tell me
she hasn’t got
the authority,

27:31.943 --> 27:34.355
because believe me,
I feel fired.

27:34.445 --> 27:36.982
Oh. Sorry, Max.

27:37.114 --> 27:40.481
Can I ask you
a question?
Sure.

27:40.576 --> 27:44.194
You— Are you, uh—
Are you sleeping
with my daughter?

27:44.288 --> 27:46.995
- No.
- Why? Are you gay?

27:47.083 --> 27:49.119
[Snickers]
No.

27:49.210 --> 27:51.997
Is she not attractive enough?
Bones is beautiful.

27:52.088 --> 27:55.797
Is it because of me? Because
I killed one man? And we both
know he deserved it.

27:55.883 --> 27:58.295
All right,just cut it out, Max.
All right, I’ll talk to her.

27:58.386 --> 28:01.594
Probably not gonna get anywhere with her,
but I’ll talk to her.

28:01.681 --> 28:04.218
You’re a good man.

28:04.308 --> 28:06.219
And I want that for her.

28:06.310 --> 28:10.474
And now I gotta go
blow up some soda
for some kids.

28:16.028 --> 28:18.440
[Brennan]
Okay, according
to the calculations,

28:18.531 --> 28:22.774
the bones must’ve started out
from somewhere in this vicinity.

28:22.869 --> 28:26.202
- [Siren Blares]
- You know something, Bones?
It’s tough being a father.

28:26.289 --> 28:28.200
Parker will be fine.

28:28.291 --> 28:30.282
Peer groups and random
environmental factors...

28:30.376 --> 28:32.458
are far more important
than family.

28:32.587 --> 28:35.249
How is that
a good thing?
[Man] Over here.

28:35.339 --> 28:38.502
Agent Booth, over here.

28:41.637 --> 28:46.051
- This must’ve been where
the body was burned
- You think?

28:46.142 --> 28:50.055
Femur, pelvis, sternum.

28:50.146 --> 28:52.808
Gunshot trauma
to the sternal angle.

28:52.899 --> 28:56.266
The buckshot embedded
in the anterior surface
indicates...

28:56.360 --> 28:58.851
that the murder weapon
was a 12-gauge shotgun.

29:01.365 --> 29:03.617
Butlthought
Cal was strangled.
He was—

29:03.743 --> 29:06.200
Strangled, shot
and set on fire.
Whoa.

29:06.287 --> 29:09.370
Someone wanted to make sure
he didn’t get home.

29:09.457 --> 29:13.200
Hey, Bones.
Look at that family crest.

29:13.294 --> 29:17.628
Looks like that someone came
from the Kings’ country home.

29:28.392 --> 29:31.759
[Booth] Mr. King,
we’d like to ask you a few
questions about your nanny

29:31.854 --> 29:34.846
I really don’t see
how I can help you, Agent Booth.

29:34.982 --> 29:38.816
My wife deals with the staﬁf
Do you own
a 12-gauge shotgun?

29:38.903 --> 29:42.521
Yeah. Several.
You’re welcome to examine them.

29:42.615 --> 29:47.234
Two months ago, Cal gave
an investor insider knowledge
about your company.

29:47.328 --> 29:49.910
- I didn’t know that.
- And ifyou had known?

29:49.997 --> 29:53.489
- I suppose I would have
tried to fire him.
- Tried?

29:53.626 --> 29:55.912
Well, I don’t think that
Elsbeth would have allowed it.
Why?

29:56.003 --> 29:59.541
- Was she having
an affair with him?
- Oh, Bones— Good one.

29:59.632 --> 30:02.965
- You two need to learn focus.
- Excuse me?

30:03.094 --> 30:04.300
Focus
Focus

30:04.387 --> 30:06.127
Either accuse me
of killing Cal...

30:06.222 --> 30:09.089
because he betrayed business secrets
or because he had sex with my wife.

30:09.183 --> 30:12.016
And then once you’ve chosen,
then contact my lawyers.

30:12.103 --> 30:14.139
I’d go with the business motive.

30:14.230 --> 30:16.767
I’m very happily married.

30:21.904 --> 30:23.940
[Whistles]
Okay, that guy’s
one cool customer.

30:24.073 --> 30:28.112
Ooh. Cool, like a—
like a murderer?
No. I don’t know, okay?

30:28.202 --> 30:30.158
Ijust don’t see him
losing his temper...

30:30.246 --> 30:32.828
or taking on some
Special Forces vet.
That’s all.

30:32.915 --> 30:36.908
All right, do you think that dog
comes with a saddle, huh?

30:40.339 --> 30:42.455
Follow me, Bones,
will ya, for a second?

30:46.762 --> 30:49.424
What’s going on?
What are you doing?

30:49.515 --> 30:51.301
Ahh.

30:52.852 --> 30:55.468
Are you gonna urinate in the gas tank
as an act ofvandalism?

30:55.563 --> 30:57.474
Are you kidding me, Bones?

30:57.565 --> 31:00.898
I would never do something like that
to this fine Italian automobile.

31:01.944 --> 31:04.026
Beautiful car.
It’s Italian, Bones.

31:04.113 --> 31:07.276
Just remember that.
Italians make
the best automobiles.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.575
Yeah, there it is.

31:13.622 --> 31:16.238
Okay, Bones.
Give me, uh, one
ofyour little Baggies.

31:16.375 --> 31:18.240
I didn’t bring evidence bags.
Thanks, Bones.
Appreciate it.

31:18.377 --> 31:20.208
You come prepared.
We’re not at a crime scene.

31:20.337 --> 31:22.293
Why would I bring evidence bags?
You always have
evidence bags.

31:24.842 --> 31:28.300
I’ve, um—
/’ve decided I’m gonna
leave the jeffersonian.

31:28.429 --> 31:30.715
Why?
Uh, because
I fired him.

31:30.806 --> 31:34.344
- You can do that?
- Oh, yeah. Believe me, she can do it.

31:34.435 --> 31:37.677
Well, it’s all about proximity
to forensic ewdence.

31:37.772 --> 31:40.514
Uh, don’t take any offense,
but that’s a lot ofcrap.

31:40.608 --> 31:43.315
It’s about a proximity
to me. Right?

31:45.696 --> 31:47.607
Well, in my opinion,

31:47.698 --> 31:50.440
it isn’t your father’s presence
that’s causing you anxiety.

31:50.534 --> 31:53.116
It’s the memory of his absence.

31:53.204 --> 31:57.072
I can understand quantum mechanics,
but I can’t understand you.

31:57.166 --> 32:00.704
Well, make it easy.
/’m lea wng the jeffersonian.

32:00.795 --> 32:02.831
You are?

32:05.007 --> 32:07.965
But I’m staying with you.
What? Oh— In my house?

32:08.052 --> 32:09.917
No. No, no.

32:10.054 --> 32:14.388
Wait, is that an offer?
No. Would you—
Would you want me to offer?

32:14.475 --> 32:16.807
No, no.
But thanks for the offer.

32:16.894 --> 32:18.725
No. It wasn’t an offer.
It wasjust a question.

32:18.813 --> 32:21.395
He isn’t saying
he’s literally staying with you.

32:21.482 --> 32:23.723
He’s promising
never to abandon you again.

32:28.155 --> 32:30.988
I’m sorry, but ifit wasn’t
for that evidence thing, I’d—

32:31.117 --> 32:33.779
I’d let you keep yourjob.
That’s simply not true.

32:33.869 --> 32:35.905
Hey, it’s all right.

32:36.831 --> 32:39.618
We’re good.

32:39.708 --> 32:42.415
Uhh! Nothing I say
has any impact.

32:42.503 --> 32:44.835
Uh, I should get back to work.

32:44.922 --> 32:47.208
Geez.

32:50.511 --> 32:52.752
Did she leave
any money?

32:59.061 --> 33:01.894
About the fractured hyoid.
Yes?

33:01.981 --> 33:05.189
I wasjust remembering
about a tapeworm.

33:05.276 --> 33:07.107
I’m gonna need more than that.

33:07.194 --> 33:11.062
There was a tapeworm in the line,
the one that went to the beer keg.

33:11.157 --> 33:14.820
I was working as a barback a couple years ago.
There’s no flow from the tap line.

33:14.910 --> 33:18.323
- First assumption— Kink in the line, right?
- What else could it be?

33:18.414 --> 33:21.702
There was a tapeworm in
the line, eight inches long.

33:21.792 --> 33:24.204
- I learned something from that.
- Drink bottled beer?

33:24.295 --> 33:28.459
The tap don’t flow,
you assume the line’s got a kink.

33:28.549 --> 33:30.631
A guy’s hyoid
is broken,

33:30.718 --> 33:32.629
you assume he died
from getting strangled.

33:32.720 --> 33:36.338
You found a tapeworm?
I mean metaphorically.

33:36.432 --> 33:39.094
Yeah, but I don’t know
if it’s a tapeworm.
I need Dr. Brennan.

33:39.185 --> 33:41.551
Dr. Saroyan?

33:41.645 --> 33:44.432
I am so your most
valuable player.

33:44.523 --> 33:47.356
Now this is the profile
of the accelerant we found
on the bones.

33:47.484 --> 33:51.727
Aviation gas.
And this is the profile of
the gas we took off Booth’s tie.

33:53.157 --> 33:55.273
Richard King’s car
runs on “av” gas?

33:55.367 --> 33:58.154
He could’ve siphoned it
out of his own car
to burn Cal Warren’s remains.

33:58.245 --> 34:02.705
- And what is this anomaly?
- C6H807.

34:02.833 --> 34:05.575
Citric acid?
it’s my considered belief.

34:05.669 --> 34:08.160
that Agent Booth spilled
orangejuice on his tie.
[laughs]

34:08.255 --> 34:10.496
I look forward to seeing him
explain that to a jury.

34:10.591 --> 34:12.502
Booth, it’s Carn.

34:12.593 --> 34:17.337
I think you’re gonna want to get yourself
a warrant to arrest Richard King.

34:17.431 --> 34:20.298
Fractures on
the transverse
processes of the C2—

34:20.392 --> 34:22.678
both sides
and the spinous process.

34:22.770 --> 34:24.510
And check out
the occipital protuberance.

34:24.647 --> 34:28.856
Oh, yes.
Maybe this will help Booth
keep Richard King in detention.

34:28.943 --> 34:32.561
Cal wasn’t strangled postmortem.
He was dragged.

34:32.655 --> 34:36.147
Strangulation is the kink.
Dragging is the tapeworm.

34:36.242 --> 34:38.403
The pattern of marks
is e ven/y spaced

34:38.494 --> 34:42.658
- as if it were from a series
of connected prongs.
- What would do that?

34:42.748 --> 34:46.582
- A choke chain.
- Richard King’s
a big strong guy.

34:46.669 --> 34:49.251
I don’t see him dragging
a dead body around
on a choke chain.

34:49.338 --> 34:51.670
That’s because he didn’t.

34:51.757 --> 34:54.590
The angle ofthe fracture
is 18 degrees.

34:54.677 --> 34:56.588
Assuming a standard
four-foot leash,

34:56.679 --> 34:59.341
whoever dragged
the victim is at most 5’5”.

34:59.431 --> 35:01.046
Elsbeth King.

35:10.025 --> 35:11.890
So, you sure you
don’t want your attorney
present, Mrs. King?

35:12.027 --> 35:15.770
Let’sjust
get this over with.
Okay. Sounds good to me.

35:15.864 --> 35:18.071
Here’s, uh, what I’m thinking.

35:18.158 --> 35:21.696
I’m thinking
that your country home
is less than a mile...

35:21.787 --> 35:24.244
from the spot where
Cal’s body was burned.

35:24.331 --> 35:28.119
You had access to the shotgun,
the aviation gas.

35:28.210 --> 35:30.747
You know how many people
work for us, Agent Booth?

35:30.838 --> 35:32.749
Every single
one of them had access.

35:32.840 --> 35:35.627
Yeah, but I don’t think
any ofthem really would have
cared ifthey found out...

35:35.718 --> 35:39.882
that Cal Warren
was trying to destroy
your husband’s company.

35:43.183 --> 35:45.799
Hmm.

35:45.894 --> 35:48.431
You have a nice life.

35:48.522 --> 35:52.561
I’m sure you got really angry
when you found out
that it was all going away.

35:52.651 --> 35:54.687
Hmm.

35:54.778 --> 35:57.315
Hmm?

35:57.406 --> 36:00.898
You don’t understand.
It wasn’t about the money.

36:02.286 --> 36:04.572
I had to protect my family.

36:08.125 --> 36:12.994
- What do you th/nk?
- In my professional opinion,
she didn’t whack him.

36:13.088 --> 36:15.249
What? Come on.
Cal betrayed them.

36:15.341 --> 36:17.707
Come on, Sweets.
For once, you were right.

36:17.843 --> 36:19.925
Embrace the wind,
my friend.
I’m sorry.

36:20.012 --> 36:23.345
But it’s Kinesics 101.
You know, you pushed
all the right buttons.

36:23.432 --> 36:26.799
But instead of her ego defense system
triggering a stress response state,

36:26.894 --> 36:29.351
she went straight
to a tacit confession.
Right.

36:29.438 --> 36:31.724
Which means she did it.

36:31.815 --> 36:33.726
No. It means she didn’t do it,

36:33.817 --> 36:36.103
but she wants you
to believe that she did.

36:36.195 --> 36:39.938
- Why would she want to do that?
- ’Cause she’s covering for someone.

36:40.032 --> 36:43.616
The only honest thing that she sa/d
was that she had to protect her lam/7y.

36:43.702 --> 36:46.660
- So we’re back to square one.
- Sort of.

36:46.747 --> 36:49.079
[Exhales]
Geez.

36:50.959 --> 36:54.543
Sweets, let me ask you
someth/ng. Uh—

36:54.630 --> 36:57.042
I mean, you’re a smart guy.
You went to private school, right?

36:57.132 --> 37:00.465
Yeah. With perfect attendance
through sixth grade,
might I add.

37:00.552 --> 37:02.838
Yeah, that’s great. Um—

37:02.930 --> 37:04.841
You don’t think
that I’m a lousy dad...

37:04.932 --> 37:07.344
for not sending my son
to private school, huh?

37:07.434 --> 37:12.303
No. But you’d be a lousy father
ifyou didn’t torture yourselfabout it.

37:12.398 --> 37:14.764
[ Cell Phone Beep/ng ]

37:14.858 --> 37:17.395
Thanks.

37:17.486 --> 37:19.602
Oh, hold on. Booth.

37:19.696 --> 37:23.234
I reviewed the placement
ofthe shotgun pellet wounds.

37:23.325 --> 37:26.237
The trajectory indicates
that whoever shot Cal...

37:26.328 --> 37:28.740
was significantly shorter
than Mrs. King.

37:28.831 --> 37:30.742
I don’t think
she did it.

37:30.874 --> 37:33.490
Right. Thanks.
[Beeps]

37:44.680 --> 37:48.889
You see, we got a court order
for your cellphone
and your laptop.

37:48.976 --> 37:52.434
You know, nothing
you text or I.M.
is really private.

37:52.563 --> 37:54.724
I knew that.
[Booth]
Real/y?

37:54.815 --> 37:56.806
Because, you know,
we checked your text messages,

37:56.900 --> 38:00.484
and we found one
from a couple weeks ago
that’s a little weird.

38:00.571 --> 38:03.529
This one is from
the night that
Cal was k/l/ed.

38:03.615 --> 38:06.072
“Br/n g it o ver no w.
Parents both gone. ”

38:06.160 --> 38:08.697
- Stop this, Richard.
- No. I want to hear it.

38:08.787 --> 38:12.029
it turns out that Alexa here
had a project due
on Ancient Greece.

38:12.124 --> 38:14.866
Mmm. You spent three days
complaining about it.

38:14.960 --> 38:18.123
- Why didn’t you just do it?
- I didn’t want to. It was stupid.

38:18.213 --> 38:20.169
Stupid? Oh.

38:20.257 --> 38:22.418
How about this one?
“‘De’ manny will do it.

38:22.509 --> 38:24.921
He can’t say no.
He works for me.”

38:25.012 --> 38:26.843
But Cal rea/[v
did say no, didn ’t he?

38:26.930 --> 38:30.093
Because you paid
a hundred bucks to
somebody else to do it for you.

38:30.184 --> 38:33.768
Someone by the name
of Dakota Shearcroft?

38:33.854 --> 38:37.096
[Richard] Oh, my God
[Booth] Yeah. / think
it’s a stupid name too.

38:37.191 --> 38:39.398
So what happened?
Did Cal catch you?

38:39.485 --> 38:41.441
He threatened
to tell the school.

38:41.528 --> 38:47.148
- Why wouldn’t he have told us?
- Cal said you wouldn’t
do anything. You never do.

38:47.242 --> 38:50.029
- He said I had to learn a lesson.
- What kind of lesson?

38:50.120 --> 38:53.078
They would’ve kicked me
out of school. Zero tolerance.

38:55.375 --> 38:57.752
My friends
are at that school.

38:59.171 --> 39:02.254
I got the gun out ofthe garage,
and I shot him.

39:04.927 --> 39:07.293
Mom came home and saw.

39:11.934 --> 39:14.596
I drove the body
to the country house,

39:14.686 --> 39:17.348
took it Into the woods
and burned it.

39:23.111 --> 39:26.399
She’s my daughter.
I had to protect her.

39:26.490 --> 39:30.108
No. You did what you always do—
make eve/yth/ng bad go away.

39:30.202 --> 39:34.320
/t’s counterproductive to raise children
In a world without consequences.

39:34.414 --> 39:37.156
Well, it looks like little Alexa here
is gonna have to come face to face...

39:37.251 --> 39:40.209
with some pretty nasty
consequences.

39:40.295 --> 39:44.459
But not the kind of consequences
you’re gonna have to face, Mrs. King.

39:55.519 --> 39:55.678
Okay, Parker, this is called
the candy mint soda experiment.

39:55.686 --> 39:58.849
Okay, Parker, this is called
the candy mint soda experiment.

39:58.939 --> 40:01.055
You can do this
for your dad at home.

So Mom copped to conspiracy
to avoid trial.

40:04.069 --> 40:05.934
She’ll spend some time
in prison.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.811
How much?
Not enough.

40:07.906 --> 40:09.862
In my opinion, she ruined
that little girl’s life.

Mm-hmm.
Well, Caroline should
charge her as an adult.

40:23.964 --> 40:26.171
She’s 11 years old, Bones.

40:26.258 --> 40:28.089
Yeah, well, she’s
old enough to speak Chinese.

40:28.176 --> 40:30.087
Uh, they don’t take that
into account.

40:30.178 --> 40:33.341
I tell ya, man, when that little girl
killed Cal Warren,

40:33.432 --> 40:36.048
she killed the best father she had.

40:36.184 --> 40:38.891
Well, sometimes it’s hard to
appreciate what you’ve got.
Mmm.

40:39.021 --> 40:40.932
You put the mints
in the tube.
Okay.

40:41.023 --> 40:43.890
[Booth ] 1 00k at him. Parker’s
never l/ked science before.

40:43.984 --> 40:46.316
[Brennan]
So are you still th/nk/ng
ofsending him to Woodbury?

40:46.403 --> 40:48.439
I torched the application.

40:48.530 --> 40:51.442

to be said for middle class.
