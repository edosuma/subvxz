WEBVTT

00:02.892 --> 00:06.330
Hmm. Okay, this day
is officially too boring.

00:06.373 --> 00:08.898
Look on the bright side,
Cricket.

00:08.941 --> 00:11.596
Perhaps learning to cope
with the mind-numbing tedium

00:11.640 --> 00:15.382
of our own existence could be
its own form of entertainment.

00:15.426 --> 00:18.298
Nah. We need something
wild and exciting.

00:18.342 --> 00:20.518
Something...

00:20.562 --> 00:22.433
Something unexpected!

00:22.476 --> 00:24.391
- [both] Mama!
- Kids, what if I told you

00:24.435 --> 00:28.352
your mama has a special
surprisewaiting for you right outside?

00:28.395 --> 00:29.919
I'd be tantalizedand intrigued.

00:29.962 --> 00:31.703
Yeah, Mom surprise.

00:31.747 --> 00:33.575
Wait, this isn't
one of those surprises

00:33.618 --> 00:36.229
like how Dad tricks me
into doing chores, right?

00:36.273 --> 00:37.642
[Bill]Cricket, I've got a big surprise

00:37.666 --> 00:39.066
waiting for you
in the laundry room.

00:39.102 --> 00:40.582
Hmm.

00:40.625 --> 00:43.410
Oh, this is way better
than laundry, kiddos.

00:43.454 --> 00:46.675
Introducing your very own
dirt bike.

00:46.718 --> 00:48.285
[both gasp]

00:51.549 --> 00:54.291
It's-- It's-- It's so beautiful.

00:54.334 --> 00:55.921
Built her from some spare parts
in the shop.

00:55.945 --> 00:58.643
She can haul,
if I do say so myself.

00:58.687 --> 01:01.298
Oh, my. Well, aren't you
quite the steed.

01:01.341 --> 01:05.389
I shall tame her, and we shall
be as horse and rider.

01:05.432 --> 01:06.869
Thank you, Mommy.

01:06.912 --> 01:08.368
Hey, everybody.
Finished baking cookies--

01:08.392 --> 01:10.089
[gasps]
No!

01:10.133 --> 01:11.395
Hey, Bill.

01:11.438 --> 01:13.658
You got the kids a dirt bike?

01:13.702 --> 01:15.268
So...

01:15.312 --> 01:17.357
- This thing safe?
- Of course.

01:17.401 --> 01:19.272
I rode these things all the timeas a kid,

01:19.316 --> 01:20.752
and look how I turned out.

01:20.796 --> 01:22.711
- Hmm.
- Bill? Hurtful.

01:22.754 --> 01:24.408
Hey, kidding.

01:24.451 --> 01:26.410
You kids'll be carefulon that thing, right?

01:26.453 --> 01:28.281
Absolutely, Papa--

01:28.325 --> 01:29.935
[cackling]

01:31.937 --> 01:34.374
Cricket, for Pete's sake, slow down!

01:34.418 --> 01:36.420
Cricket's never
slowing down again.

01:36.463 --> 01:38.378
If only there
was something to jump!

01:39.336 --> 01:40.598
Whee!

01:40.642 --> 01:41.991
Whoa.

01:42.034 --> 01:44.428
- Yeah!
- Son, look out!

01:44.471 --> 01:45.647
Huh?

01:47.823 --> 01:50.042
- [cooing]
- [cawing]

01:50.086 --> 01:51.653
[both laughing]

01:51.696 --> 01:53.176
[wind gusts]

01:53.219 --> 01:54.394
[laughing]

01:55.526 --> 01:57.223
[crows cawing]

01:58.790 --> 02:00.270
We're dead.

02:00.313 --> 02:01.314
[screaming]

02:02.838 --> 02:04.317
Gotcha.

02:04.361 --> 02:06.624
[truck horn blaring]

02:06.668 --> 02:09.235
That could have been me.

02:09.279 --> 02:10.454
Cricket! You okay?

02:10.497 --> 02:11.760
I-I-I don't know.

02:11.803 --> 02:13.762
My bones ain't broke.

02:13.805 --> 02:15.241
But the bike sure is.

02:15.285 --> 02:17.504
Nothing a little fixingcan't fix.

02:17.548 --> 02:18.854
- Aah!
- Cricket, it's okay.

02:18.897 --> 02:20.246
It's just a backfire.

02:20.290 --> 02:21.291
I ain't riding anymore.

02:21.334 --> 02:22.771
You can't make me.

02:22.814 --> 02:24.207
I ain't making you do nothing.

02:24.250 --> 02:25.730
Wait. Something's wrong.

02:25.774 --> 02:27.210
It's like my brain's
trying to think

02:27.253 --> 02:29.255
before doing things.

02:29.299 --> 02:31.780
- I've gone insane!
- [Tilly] No, dear brother.

02:31.823 --> 02:35.479
You're finally
experiencingthe fragility of life.

02:35.522 --> 02:37.307
Like that of the humble egg.

02:37.350 --> 02:38.830
- May I?
- [clucks]

02:38.874 --> 02:41.485
We are but delicate
shell and yolk.

02:41.528 --> 02:44.314
All it takes is one slip
or mistake, and...

02:46.011 --> 02:47.883
- Tilly, quit wasting food.
- Aah!

02:47.926 --> 02:50.146
My whole life I've been
running around acting crazy,

02:50.189 --> 02:52.888
having no clue I was such
a fragile little egg!

02:52.931 --> 02:54.716
- [whimpers]
- Uh, Nance? A little help?

02:54.759 --> 02:56.326
Calm down, Cricket.

02:56.369 --> 02:58.371
You just need to bea bit safer, is all.

02:58.415 --> 03:00.330
I'm going to gofix up the bike.

03:00.373 --> 03:02.636
When you're ready to hop
back on, just give me a holler.

03:02.680 --> 03:04.987
But I don't know how to be safe.

03:05.030 --> 03:06.815
And it's not like I know
some lame,

03:06.858 --> 03:10.166
boring, old, safety-loving
expert who can teach me.

03:10.209 --> 03:12.472
Sun's strong today.

03:12.516 --> 03:14.736
Did everyone put on
their sunscreen?

03:14.779 --> 03:17.216
Bingo-bango.
Father! Father!

03:17.260 --> 03:18.672
I can't believe I'm actually
saying this,

03:18.696 --> 03:21.917
but can you teach me
your ways of safety?

03:21.960 --> 03:23.440
Yes.

03:23.483 --> 03:25.747
Yes, I can.

03:25.790 --> 03:27.357
All right, Cricket.

03:27.400 --> 03:29.925
The secret to staying safe
is threat assessment.

03:29.968 --> 03:31.796
Assess threats.
Got it.

03:31.840 --> 03:33.755
And there's no better way
to assess threats

03:33.798 --> 03:35.800
than the uh-oh technique.

03:35.844 --> 03:37.976
I am intrigued.
Please continue.

03:38.020 --> 03:40.762
The uh-oh technique
is my own personal system

03:40.805 --> 03:42.938
for identifying danger.

03:42.981 --> 03:44.461
Allow me to demonstrate.

03:44.504 --> 03:46.593
Uh-oh, some rusty nails.

03:46.637 --> 03:48.726
Uh-oh neutralized.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.728
Very interesting.

03:50.772 --> 03:53.513
Uh-oh, Miss Brenda's looking
mighty mean today.

03:53.557 --> 03:55.428
Better set up a perimeter
so no one gets kicked

03:55.472 --> 03:57.866
by her powerful haunches.

03:57.909 --> 04:01.130
Don't get kicked?
Okay, that's a lot to take in.

04:01.173 --> 04:02.411
Just steer clear
of the "uh-ohs,"

04:02.435 --> 04:03.915
and you won't get uh-ohs
of your own.

04:03.959 --> 04:05.787
- Now you give it a try.
- All right.

04:05.830 --> 04:08.528
First step:
assess threats.

04:08.572 --> 04:09.834
Hmm.

04:09.878 --> 04:11.618
[dog whimpers]

04:11.662 --> 04:14.012
Dog is uh-oh?

04:15.622 --> 04:17.320
Hmm.

04:17.363 --> 04:19.104
Rake is uh-oh?

04:19.148 --> 04:21.063
Correct.
Someone could step on that

04:21.106 --> 04:22.499
and get bonked in the nogging.

04:22.542 --> 04:24.414
Now you're thinking safe.

04:24.457 --> 04:25.502
[laughs]

04:25.545 --> 04:26.938
Uh-oh! A bee!

04:26.982 --> 04:29.114
Somebody could get stung
by that bee.

04:29.158 --> 04:31.638
Wow! Two for two.

04:31.682 --> 04:33.640
And then, after they get stung
in the face,

04:33.684 --> 04:37.209
they could stumble
uncontrollably,

04:37.253 --> 04:39.429
crashing into the apple tree.

04:39.472 --> 04:40.560
- Uh-oh!
- Yeah.

04:40.604 --> 04:42.606
I guess that could happen.

04:42.649 --> 04:44.738
And then the apples,
they will fall,

04:44.782 --> 04:48.220
pelting my delicate shell
one after the other,

04:48.264 --> 04:50.962
till I crack open like the
fragile little egg that I am.

04:51.006 --> 04:52.834
Aah! Uh-oh.

04:52.877 --> 04:54.183
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh!

04:54.226 --> 04:55.401
[gasps]

04:55.445 --> 04:57.186
[coos]

04:57.229 --> 04:59.536
That pigeon could peck my shell
till my yolk drips out.

04:59.579 --> 05:01.103
Uh-oh! Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

05:01.146 --> 05:02.495
[gasps]

05:02.539 --> 05:03.757
These blades of grass

05:03.801 --> 05:05.934
could slice me right open!
Ow!

05:05.977 --> 05:08.284
Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Uh-oh!

05:08.327 --> 05:10.895
Cricket?
Hey there, buddy.

05:10.939 --> 05:13.071
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
- Seeing a lot of uh-oh's, huh?

05:13.115 --> 05:15.552
The outside is full of danger.
Got to get inside.

05:15.595 --> 05:17.554
Sir, I suggest you do the same!

05:17.597 --> 05:18.903
[screams]

05:18.947 --> 05:20.905
Uh-oh.

05:20.949 --> 05:24.126
[Nancy]
And tighten the swing arm.
And we're done.

05:24.169 --> 05:26.650
Phew. Too bad Cricket
doesn't want to try again.

05:26.693 --> 05:28.913
How about you, Till?
Think you're ready for a ride?

05:28.957 --> 05:30.436
Oh, I'm ready, Mama.

05:30.480 --> 05:32.482
But the question is,
is Geraldine?

05:32.525 --> 05:33.918
Geral-whomst?

05:33.962 --> 05:35.833
That's what I've decided
to name the bike.

05:35.877 --> 05:37.661
Before we ride,

05:37.704 --> 05:39.489
we have to connect
with each other as equals.

05:39.532 --> 05:42.535
Trust is the foundation between
a rider and her steed.

05:42.579 --> 05:45.712
Allow me to soothe your soul
with a calming melody.

05:45.756 --> 05:47.540
[ululates]

05:48.977 --> 05:50.500
Well, while you're busy bonding,

05:50.543 --> 05:52.806
I think I'll check inon your brother.

05:52.850 --> 05:54.199
Sug? You in here?

05:57.333 --> 05:59.074
[sizzling]

05:59.117 --> 06:00.640
Uh, Cricket?

06:00.684 --> 06:02.686
[bubble wrap popping]

06:02.729 --> 06:03.774
Hello, Mother.

06:03.817 --> 06:05.515
Hey, kiddo.

06:05.558 --> 06:07.169
So, what's all this?

06:07.212 --> 06:09.432
Just taking a few
safety precautions.

06:09.475 --> 06:11.497
Did you know the most
common place people get injured

06:11.521 --> 06:13.523
is in their own home?

06:13.566 --> 06:15.457
We've been living in
a death trap this whole time.

06:15.481 --> 06:18.397
No telling how many uh-ohs
could happen.

06:18.441 --> 06:20.660
Uh-ohs? That doesn't sound like
a Cricket thing.

06:20.704 --> 06:23.707
- Sounds more like a...
- [floorboards creak]

06:23.750 --> 06:25.013
Bill.

06:25.056 --> 06:26.579
Did you teach him this?

06:28.190 --> 06:29.452
Maybe.

06:29.495 --> 06:30.540
Listen, Cricket,

06:30.583 --> 06:32.368
I wanted you to be safe,

06:32.411 --> 06:34.065
but I wasn't expecting
this much zeal.

06:34.109 --> 06:35.545
Oh, typical Bill.

06:35.588 --> 06:37.155
Of course you wouldn't
understand.

06:37.199 --> 06:38.591
What's that supposed to mean?

06:38.635 --> 06:40.158
Well, no offense Dad,

06:40.202 --> 06:41.570
but we all know
you don't take safety

06:41.594 --> 06:43.161
as seriously as you should.

06:43.205 --> 06:45.468
- Excuse me?
- I'm so safety-minded,

06:45.511 --> 06:47.600
I invented these things
to protect my feet.

06:47.644 --> 06:49.776
I call them hard socks.

06:49.820 --> 06:53.215
Cricket, those already exist.
They're called shoes.

06:53.258 --> 06:55.217
Well, well, Mr. Know-It-All.

06:55.260 --> 06:56.958
Okay Cricket, that's enough.

06:57.001 --> 06:58.742
Listen, I finished
fixing up the bike.

06:58.785 --> 07:00.744
Maybe you should hop on
and try again.

07:00.787 --> 07:02.615
Prove there's nothing
to be scared of.

07:02.659 --> 07:04.313
[cackles]

07:04.356 --> 07:05.967
Aw, you're cute.

07:06.010 --> 07:08.012
Little baby Crickey
is never going to do anything

07:08.056 --> 07:09.796
needlessly reckless again.

07:09.840 --> 07:11.450
This is the new life I choose,
Mother.

07:11.494 --> 07:13.322
Being a safe bubble-wrapped boy.

07:13.365 --> 07:16.760
Well, off to find some more
industrial-grade bubble wrap

07:16.803 --> 07:18.414
to use on the rest of the house.

07:18.457 --> 07:19.937
Bill, a word.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.417
Okay, we broke our son.

07:21.460 --> 07:23.288
What are we going to do
to fix this?

07:23.332 --> 07:25.527
Now hold on, Nance. I know
he's going a little overboard,

07:25.551 --> 07:28.119
but isn't it a good thing that
he's being a bit extra careful?

07:28.163 --> 07:29.512
I don't know.

07:29.555 --> 07:31.427
[Cricket]
Oh, hey, Dad?

07:31.470 --> 07:33.622
FYI, I'm getting rid of all
the dangerous objects we have,

07:33.646 --> 07:34.797
so all your farm tools
had to go.

07:34.821 --> 07:36.345
- You're welcome.
- What?

07:36.388 --> 07:37.999
[truck beeping]

07:39.565 --> 07:41.828
Yeesh. What should we...?

07:41.872 --> 07:43.439
- Get the boy.
- Right.

07:43.482 --> 07:45.832
- Cricket!
- [bubble wrap popping]

07:45.876 --> 07:47.182
I can't believe I'm saying this,

07:47.225 --> 07:49.967
but please go back
to being a reckless kid.

07:50.011 --> 07:52.361
We just want
our old Cricket back.

07:52.404 --> 07:54.276
No! I'll never go back
to the way I was.

07:54.319 --> 07:56.060
Turtle maneuver.

07:56.104 --> 07:59.063
Cricket, we're just trying
to help you.

07:59.107 --> 08:00.673
I can't believe this.

08:00.717 --> 08:02.588
My own family is now a threat
to my safety.

08:02.632 --> 08:03.763
Well, uh-oh to you.

08:03.807 --> 08:05.765
Uh-oh to you all.

08:05.809 --> 08:07.506
Well, if that's the wayyou feel.

08:07.550 --> 08:09.247
[Tilly]
Mama!

08:09.291 --> 08:13.121
Sweet Geraldine and Ihave
forged an unbreakable bond.

08:13.164 --> 08:15.819
We are now ready to ride.

08:15.862 --> 08:17.516
That's my girl.

08:17.560 --> 08:19.190
Hey, bud, your sister and I
are going to go riding.

08:19.214 --> 08:20.954
Sure would love
to have you come along.

08:20.998 --> 08:23.914
Wait, how can they still
be going riding?

08:23.957 --> 08:25.524
It's too dangerous.

08:25.568 --> 08:27.483
Don't they know
they could get hurt?

08:27.526 --> 08:28.745
Uh-oh!

08:28.788 --> 08:30.921
Tilly, get off that thing! Oh!

08:30.964 --> 08:33.445
- Got your helmet on, hon?
- Right here, Mama.

08:33.489 --> 08:36.057
- Safety roll.
- Cricket? What are you doing?

08:36.100 --> 08:38.363
- I'm saving you.
- Well, stop it.

08:38.407 --> 08:39.973
You're going to spook Geraldine.

08:40.017 --> 08:41.279
Geraldine's dangerous.

08:41.323 --> 08:42.802
- [Tilly] Whoa!
- [Nancy] Cricket!

08:42.846 --> 08:43.890
Geraldine!

08:43.934 --> 08:45.718
[screaming]

08:45.762 --> 08:47.677
My bubble wrap armor
is caught in the throttle.

08:47.720 --> 08:49.307
Maybe if I just yank it
real hard, like th--

08:49.331 --> 08:51.115
- [engine revs]
- Aah!

08:51.159 --> 08:53.552
I just made it worse!

08:53.596 --> 08:54.814
Cricket, grab my hand!

08:56.251 --> 08:57.948
- [both exclaiming]
- Cricket!

08:57.991 --> 09:00.385
Just take off that bubble wrap
and control the bike!

09:00.429 --> 09:01.778
It isn't safe.

09:01.821 --> 09:03.693
Cricket, life isn't
some death trap!

09:03.736 --> 09:04.998
[gasps]

09:05.042 --> 09:07.305
Oh, no, not another one.

09:07.349 --> 09:09.002
We got to finish this bridge.

09:09.046 --> 09:11.135
Well, I guess there's only
one thing left to do.

09:11.179 --> 09:12.832
Emergency turtle maneuver!

09:12.876 --> 09:15.618
Look, honey,
you can't just hidefrom the world.

09:15.661 --> 09:17.750
See, life is like, well,
a dirt bike.

09:17.794 --> 09:19.361
Yeah, it can be dangerous,

09:19.404 --> 09:21.319
but you're safer steering
than turtling.

09:21.363 --> 09:23.582
So face your fears
and take control of your life.

09:23.626 --> 09:25.323
[whimpers]

09:25.367 --> 09:28.021
[grunts]

09:28.065 --> 09:30.676
Yeah, that's my boy.
Chew that plastic.

09:31.938 --> 09:33.723
Uh, okay,

09:33.766 --> 09:35.116
you're really getting in there.

09:37.379 --> 09:39.729
I'm free!

09:39.772 --> 09:41.296
Oh, no! A child! Aah!

09:41.339 --> 09:43.733
Aah! Oh, Cricket Green.

09:43.776 --> 09:45.648
Take control.

09:45.691 --> 09:47.389
[tires squeal]

09:47.432 --> 09:48.825
Good job, kid!

09:48.868 --> 09:51.175
[loud crash, explosion]

09:51.219 --> 09:52.872
[laughs]

09:52.916 --> 09:55.179
I'm doing it!
I'm really doing it!

09:55.223 --> 09:56.441
[gasps]

09:58.617 --> 10:00.967
Hmm. Face your fears.

10:01.968 --> 10:03.840
Yeah!

10:06.277 --> 10:07.931
Hooray.

10:07.974 --> 10:10.586
Nice jump, sug. How you feel?

10:10.629 --> 10:13.893
I... I feel alive.

10:13.937 --> 10:15.243
See, hon?

10:15.286 --> 10:16.698
You just needed
to find some balance.

10:16.722 --> 10:18.289
[explosion]

10:18.333 --> 10:22.293
Or maybe you just
shouldn'thave a dirt bike.

10:22.337 --> 10:23.947
[Cricket]
Agreed.

10:23.990 --> 10:25.011
Okay, kiddo, let's get you home.

10:25.035 --> 10:27.820
Hey, Mom, can we pop a wheelie?

10:27.864 --> 10:29.735
Glad to have you back, Cricket.

10:29.779 --> 10:31.172
