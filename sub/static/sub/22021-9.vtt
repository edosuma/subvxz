WEBVTT

00:01.210 --> 00:02.826
Previously on "Designated Survivor”...

00:02.961 --> 00:06.704
No, I've been posted full time to the
British Embassy, effective immediately.

00:07.799 --> 00:08.960
[laughs]

00:09.092 --> 00:11.470
Did you take a vacation on St. Lucia?

00:11.595 --> 00:15.463
Every year, my daughter
and I take one trip together.

00:15.599 --> 00:17.181
This year, it was St. Lucia.

00:17.309 --> 00:19.801
"You're being subpoenaed
by John Foerstel"? For what?

00:19.937 --> 00:22.099
Foerstel's found
a St. Lucian bank account

00:22.231 --> 00:26.020
set up by Eric Little six months ago...
in my name.

00:26.151 --> 00:27.528
I'm being set up.

00:27.653 --> 00:29.269
Where are we at
with Little's murder investigation?

00:29.404 --> 00:30.656
[Kendra] No developments
on that front, sir.

00:30.781 --> 00:33.398
Have you been able to tie Eric Little
to Patrick Lloyd yet?

00:33.534 --> 00:35.491
There is no evidence
that connects the two.

00:35.619 --> 00:37.201
You're the greatest thing
since sliced bread.

00:37.329 --> 00:40.447
And bread is great, fundamentally great,
like water.

00:40.582 --> 00:42.323
Or air. Or you.

00:44.294 --> 00:45.830
Good evening, Officer. Is there a problem?

00:45.963 --> 00:48.580
-Step out of the vehicle, sir.
-The charges were dismissed.

00:48.715 --> 00:50.968
But my duty to inform
the President wasn't.

00:52.094 --> 00:54.836
<i>3 Got a box full of letters &</i>

00:56.139 --> 00:58.392

J Being directed at me [

01:22.165 --> 01:23.200
[Kendra] Three-letter Day.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.665
Every month, the White House receives
10,000 letters asking for help.

01:25.794 --> 01:27.876
The President chooses
three of those letters to answer.

01:28.005 --> 01:29.211
And how does that involve us?

01:29.339 --> 01:31.421
The senior staff investigates the requests
and advises the President.

01:31.550 --> 01:32.506
-That's exciting.
-Yeah.

01:32.634 --> 01:34.545
A three-letter Day
can be a red-letter day.

01:34.678 --> 01:36.043
-[Lyor] I'm not doing this.
-For some.

01:36.179 --> 01:38.671
| don't even like letters.
| don't read them. I don't write them.

01:38.807 --> 01:41.469
-Whose asinine idea was this, anyway?
-[Emily] The President's.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.092
-I'm in.
-Attaboy.

01:43.228 --> 01:45.606
-Three-letter Day, amigo.
-[Lyor] Oh, somebody please shoot me.

01:45.731 --> 01:47.313
-Hey.
-[Emily] Hi.

01:48.317 --> 01:50.684
Today is not just simply symbolic.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.059
It matters, because today,

01:52.195 --> 01:54.027
we are gonna truly
show the electorate

01:54.156 --> 01:56.818
by trying to answer some of
their more specific requests.

01:56.950 --> 02:00.739
Aaron and Emily, this letter was written
by the widow of Daniel Goff,

02:00.871 --> 02:02.111
Sergeant First Class.

02:02.247 --> 02:04.955
She would like to know why her husband
was denied the Medal of Honor

02:05.083 --> 02:08.326
for his ultimate sacrifice and bravery
during Operation Enduring Freedom.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.452
-On it, sir.
-Absolutely.

02:09.588 --> 02:10.874
Thank you.

02:11.006 --> 02:14.044
Seth and Lyor,
you're gonna help Mr. Adamson

02:14.176 --> 02:15.917
figure out what's killing his bees.

02:16.053 --> 02:17.919
-Bees?
-Yes, bees.

02:18.055 --> 02:19.545
They're an indicator species, Seth.

02:19.681 --> 02:21.922
They pollinate over 80% of our crops.

02:22.059 --> 02:25.268
They die, plants die,
and man will shortly follow.

02:25.395 --> 02:27.727
Soitis in our interest to do
whatever we can

02:27.856 --> 02:29.813
to figure out what the hell
is killing his bees.

02:29.941 --> 02:32.194
Thank you, sir.
This is a solemn honor.

02:32.319 --> 02:33.559
I'm sure you'll do great.

02:36.031 --> 02:37.613
-Jackpot.
-Snake eyes.

02:37.741 --> 02:41.951
Kendra, this is a request for a pardon
in a federal death penalty case.

02:42.079 --> 02:44.992
There hasn't been a federal execution
since 2003.

02:45.123 --> 02:48.457
He's scheduled to die by lethal injection
this Friday in Petersburg.

02:48.585 --> 02:51.452
An anonymous letter postmarked
Winter Haven, Florida,

02:51.588 --> 02:53.625
<i>seeking clemency
for Chandler Dem”?</i>

02:53.757 --> 02:58.297
He was a pharmacist convicted
of killing a DEA agent in 2001.

02:58.428 --> 03:03.844
This writer says that Dern appealed
his sentence but not his conviction.

03:03.975 --> 03:06.683
That's the part that caught my eye.
Strange, right?

03:06.812 --> 03:08.302
Unheard of, sir, given the stakes.

03:08.438 --> 03:11.180
I'm not inclined to impose my judgment
over that of a jury,

03:11.316 --> 03:13.648
but if you were to find anything
to indicate manifest injustice,

03:13.777 --> 03:15.984
-I would want to know.
-I'll get cracking.

03:16.113 --> 03:18.445
-You've got 72 hours.
-Understood.

03:18.573 --> 03:20.029
Sir, we have another issue.

03:20.158 --> 03:22.365
There's been a development
in regards to your wife's subpoena.

03:22.494 --> 03:23.780
We should talk.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.988
Foerstel's offering
to seal the proceedings?

03:27.124 --> 03:30.082
With one huge condition. That you don't
move to quash your subpoena.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.998
So, an inducement;
secrecy in exchange for cooperation.

03:33.130 --> 03:34.336
[Tom] Wait a second.

03:34.464 --> 03:37.297
If Alex appears and her answers lead
to an indictment, that will go public.

03:37.426 --> 03:39.292
It's a calculated risk, sir.

03:39.428 --> 03:41.294
What are the odds
that you can get this tossed?

03:41.430 --> 03:42.511
It's a coin flip, ma'am.

03:42.639 --> 03:45.176
The conspiracy case against you
is wildly circumstantial

03:45.308 --> 03:46.810
with one exception.

03:46.935 --> 03:49.097
The existence of the account
in St. Lucia in your name

03:49.229 --> 03:50.685
that Eric Little opened is damning.

03:50.814 --> 03:53.181
And unless Hannah Wells
can find the banker who set it up,

03:53.316 --> 03:55.023
we cannot clear you.

03:59.364 --> 04:01.321
The banker is the only person
who can prove

04:01.450 --> 04:04.283
that the First Lady's St. Lucia account
is a Lloyd set-up.

04:04.411 --> 04:06.448
-They'll never give you his name.
-We'll see.

04:06.580 --> 04:09.072
-I can be very persuasive.
-[cellphone beeps]

04:09.207 --> 04:12.495
Hello. I'm Miss Sloane.
I'm here to see Mr. Brewer?

04:12.627 --> 04:14.538
You would like to open
an account in St. Lucia?

04:14.671 --> 04:16.332
-Yes.
-On someone else's behalf?

04:16.464 --> 04:17.546
Yes.

04:17.673 --> 04:19.880
That is an unusual third-party service
we do not offer.

04:20.010 --> 04:23.719
| have it from a trusted friend
that one of your officers

04:23.847 --> 04:25.554
-does, in fact, offer the service.
-Is that so?

04:25.682 --> 04:27.889
If you could just put me
in touch with the right person,

04:28.018 --> 04:29.725
I'd be happy to pay a premium.

04:29.853 --> 04:31.560
I'm sorry, but we are unable to help you.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.554
If you could just give me
the name of the officer--

04:33.690 --> 04:35.272
That will be all, Miss Sloane.
Have a good day.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.730
[whispering indistinctly]

04:54.711 --> 04:55.621
Oh! Ah!

04:55.754 --> 04:58.746
Now, you shouldn't play with guns
if you don't know how to use them.

04:58.882 --> 05:00.589
-Me? I know how to use them.
-[gun cocks]

05:00.717 --> 05:04.130
Now, would you like to give me
the name of that bank officer?

05:05.013 --> 05:07.345
Quashing this thing is gonna
come down to the judge of the day.

05:07.474 --> 05:08.430
Yes, sir.

05:08.558 --> 05:11.471
And the optics of giving the First Lady
a pass could weigh heavily on them.

05:11.603 --> 05:14.061
What should weigh heavily on them
is that this is a damn set-up.

05:14.189 --> 05:16.226
-Alex.
-We're moving to quash, Tom.

05:18.527 --> 05:21.110
Kendra, could you give us a moment,
please? We need to discuss this.

05:21.238 --> 05:23.275
-Yes, sir.
-Thank you.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.282
This witch hunt has been
going on for months.

05:27.410 --> 05:28.821
| know.

05:28.954 --> 05:30.820
| don't want to give Foerstel
any more oxygen.

05:30.956 --> 05:32.742
Every procedural maneuver,
every stratagem;

05:32.874 --> 05:36.412
-we'll avail ourselves of all of it.
-That's only putting off the inevitable.

05:36.545 --> 05:37.626
Foerstel's not gonna back down

05:37.754 --> 05:39.586
just because you quote
the Federal Rules of Procedure.

05:39.714 --> 05:41.330
It's our only viable tactic, Tom.

05:41.466 --> 05:44.299
It's what we've been doing so far,
playing defense.

05:44.427 --> 05:46.589
And look where it's gotten us.
Closer to the precipice.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.177
Well, then, let's step back.

05:48.306 --> 05:49.341
Alex.

05:49.474 --> 05:50.930
You are a fighter.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.801
That's one of the many things
| love about you.

05:53.937 --> 05:54.927
But we're not fighting this.

05:55.063 --> 05:57.145
We're hiding, pretending like
it's gonna blow over.

05:57.274 --> 06:00.266
Well, it's not. This storm has been
coming at us for a while.

06:00.402 --> 06:03.269
We tried to outrun it, but we couldn't.
So we take a different tact.

06:03.405 --> 06:05.772
We dig in. We fight this thing.

06:07.158 --> 06:09.570
[theme music]

06:19.588 --> 06:21.829
| roll over this morning
and you're not there.

06:21.965 --> 06:25.048
-That can really give a guy a complex.
-Well, you needed your beauty sleep.

06:25.176 --> 06:27.383
Well, I'm saying I could've helped you
track down the banker

06:27.512 --> 06:28.752
who helped frame the First Lady.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.846
And I'm saying
it wasn't a two-man job.

06:30.974 --> 06:33.056
You, Hannah Wells, are a lone wolf.

06:33.184 --> 06:35.892
Who hunted down
the banker's name.

06:36.021 --> 06:37.352
Touché.

06:38.023 --> 06:39.809
Anything on our rogue banker?

06:39.941 --> 06:44.731
TSA confirms Alfonso Lang flew from
Hewanorra to Dulles four days ago.

06:44.863 --> 06:46.149
Does he have a sheet?

06:46.281 --> 06:48.568
A lot of raps for money laundering,
all of which he's beaten.

06:48.700 --> 06:52.034
-Otherwise he'd be on the no-fly list.
-You got a 4-1-1 on his location?

06:52.162 --> 06:53.869
Nothing past a contact
at Interpol telling me

06:53.997 --> 06:57.206
he meets with clients in the District
pretty regularly to set up tax scams.

06:57.334 --> 07:00.247
Well, I'll contact the Embassy to see
if he's on one of their watch lists

07:00.378 --> 07:02.494
and tripped a wire.
St. Lucia's a British protectorate.

07:02.631 --> 07:03.917
Actually, St. Lucia
is a sovereign nation.

07:04.049 --> 07:06.256
-Part of the Commonwealth.
-Well done, Charles.

07:06.384 --> 07:07.499
You should go on Jeopardy!

07:07.636 --> 07:08.717
And you should...

07:09.763 --> 07:11.379
...go on it too.

07:11.514 --> 07:14.131
-[cellphone rings]
-[Hannah] Hey, Kendra.

07:15.644 --> 07:17.851
Yeah, of course. I'll be right there.

07:17.979 --> 07:20.812
The White House Counsel
needs help with an urgent matter.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.932
No problem. I'll call you
as soon as I find anything.

07:23.068 --> 07:25.651
All right. Play nice, boys.

07:30.325 --> 07:32.908
[man speaking indistinctly over P.A.]

07:33.036 --> 07:34.572
[door lock buzzes]

07:36.373 --> 07:37.909
No, I don't know who sent it.

07:38.041 --> 07:39.998
But every word's true. I'm innocent.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.412
We reviewed your file.

07:41.544 --> 07:45.913
You were convicted of murdering
a DEA agent named Carl Marley in 2001.

07:46.049 --> 07:47.289
A Ketamine sting gone bad.

07:47.425 --> 07:50.918
The prosecutor convinced the jury that
your pharmacy was in financial trouble.

07:51.054 --> 07:53.295
And that I was trying to sell Ketamine
on the black market

07:53.431 --> 07:54.887
when I never even jaywalked.

07:55.016 --> 07:57.474
Marley's body was found
in a park near your store.

07:57.602 --> 07:59.684
Shot in the face with a gun
that was never located.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.680
Traces of his blood were found
the next day on your storage room floor.

08:02.816 --> 08:06.104
20 people were in that room every day.
Anyone could've dragged it in.

08:06.236 --> 08:08.819
What about your trial lawyer, Mr. Dern?
Can we talk to him?

08:08.947 --> 08:11.439
No. He died three years ago.

08:11.741 --> 08:13.903
But he was pretty worthless
when he was alive.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.697
And how much money
did you have left after the trial?

08:16.830 --> 08:19.071
As it turned out...

08:19.457 --> 08:21.744
just enough to appeal the sentence.

08:21.876 --> 08:26.461
Mr. Dern, this was a highly
circumstantial case.

08:26.965 --> 08:28.876
Your lawyer did a bad job.

08:29.801 --> 08:31.587
We're going to look into this for you.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.131
That's great.

08:33.888 --> 08:36.140
But I believe
I've exhausted my appeals.

08:36.265 --> 08:38.633
It wouldn't be an appeal.
It would be a commutation.

08:38.768 --> 08:41.601
And if the President were to grant that,
| wouldn't have words.

08:41.730 --> 08:44.973
But I've been waiting for justice
for a long time, and it's never come.

08:45.108 --> 08:47.440
Hope is a dangerous thing.

08:48.611 --> 08:52.229
| don't want to die a coward praying
for a reprieve that's never coming.

08:52.741 --> 08:55.073
That's not a legacy
| want for my children.

08:55.201 --> 08:57.943
Then don't pray. Prepare.

08:58.079 --> 08:59.911
And let us do our thing.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.997
<i>Chandler Dem
has two master's degrees.</i>

09:02.125 --> 09:05.993
Does it make any sense to you
that a lawyer, even a... a crooked one,

09:06.129 --> 09:08.871
could convince him that
it was a good idea not to appeal?

09:09.007 --> 09:11.840
-Not even a little bit.
-He's got a son in Gaithersburg.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.754
Let's see what he has to say.

09:14.304 --> 09:16.011
Frank, thank you for talking to us.

09:16.139 --> 09:18.005
I'm thrilled that you're looking
into my father's sentence.

09:18.141 --> 09:20.508
Do you really think there's a chance
the President might step in?

09:20.643 --> 09:23.351
-It depends on our investigation.
-How can I help?

09:23.480 --> 09:26.689
Can you think of any reason why your
father wouldn't be forthcoming with us?

09:26.816 --> 09:28.398
What did he tell you?

09:28.526 --> 09:31.689
Oh, it's not what he told us.
It's what we're asking you to tell us.

09:31.821 --> 09:34.279
You know what's interesting, Frank?
You're very devoted to your father.

09:34.407 --> 09:37.650
Visitor logs at the prison say that
you're in there twice a week to see him.

09:37.786 --> 09:40.244
But your younger sister Tracy
hasn't been to see him in 16 years,

09:40.371 --> 09:42.203
and we're wondering why.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.991
My mom died when I was 6.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.165
| was 17 when they took him away and...

09:50.173 --> 09:51.629
| got through it.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.749
| set up a successful
auto-repair business.

09:53.885 --> 09:55.421
Tracy, she wasn't so lucky.

09:55.553 --> 09:58.170
But my dad, he to--

09:59.015 --> 10:01.052
He told us to always put family first.

10:01.184 --> 10:02.891
I'm-1'm not talking about Tracy.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.886
All right, we don't have time for games.
Your father's life is on the line.

10:07.398 --> 10:11.187
My sister, she's always had
problems with drugs.

10:11.319 --> 10:14.232
Back in the day, she was hanging out
with some pretty bad people,

10:14.364 --> 10:16.071
and I think that my father was afraid

10:16.199 --> 10:18.691
that his investigation
would somehow implicate her.

10:18.827 --> 10:21.489
Were those people used as a defense
in your father's trial?

10:21.621 --> 10:23.123
No, my dad wouldn't allow that.

10:23.248 --> 10:24.613
-Where can we find your sister?
-No.

10:24.749 --> 10:27.036
If he knew that I told you any of this,
he would disown me.

10:27.168 --> 10:29.785
Frank, your father
is about to be put to death.

10:29.921 --> 10:31.662
| don't think disowning you
is the issue here.

10:36.386 --> 10:38.297
[Emily] Your husband was
very handsome, Mrs. Goff.

10:38.429 --> 10:40.136
Thank you.

10:40.265 --> 10:41.721
Daniel was my everything.

10:42.392 --> 10:44.258
[Aaron] The President was moved
by your letter, ma'am.

10:44.394 --> 10:45.930
We wonder if you could tell us more.

10:46.062 --> 10:50.181
Daniel was sent to Kandahar
in 2013 to battle ISIL.

10:50.316 --> 10:52.478
Part of the international
peacekeeping force.

10:52.610 --> 10:56.604
Yes. And one of the first
American casualties.

10:56.739 --> 11:00.073
At his funeral, one of his soldiers,
Corporal Mankiewicz,

11:00.201 --> 11:03.739
told me Daniel single-handedly
kept the insurgents at bay

11:03.872 --> 11:05.613
until help could arrive.

11:05.748 --> 11:08.786
He stopped them from overrunning
the American position.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.125
Sounds like conspicuous bravery.

11:11.254 --> 11:16.249
| think so. But I wrote
his C.0O. Colonel Baines.

11:16.384 --> 11:17.966
And he ignored me.

11:19.971 --> 11:21.052
Uh...

11:22.098 --> 11:25.181
12 letters over the past 4 years,

11:25.310 --> 11:26.892
and he didn't answer one.

11:27.020 --> 11:30.479
Daniel once told me
Special Forces was like family.

11:30.607 --> 11:32.769
But this is not how you treat family.

11:35.278 --> 11:38.441
Our son Danny Jr. is 7 now,

11:39.657 --> 11:41.648
asking about his father.

11:42.952 --> 11:45.990
| would like to be able to tell him
his dad was a war hero

11:46.122 --> 11:48.739
and not just some stranger
who died 10,000 miles away.

11:52.337 --> 11:55.295
Ma'am, on behalf of the President,
we promise to look into this.

11:56.257 --> 11:57.759
Thank you.

11:59.344 --> 12:00.755
[keyboard clacking]

12:01.846 --> 12:04.508
Sergeant Goff's unit
was ambushed in Kandahar.

12:04.641 --> 12:08.259
Mortars. RPGs. Machine guns.
They were pinned down for hours.

12:08.394 --> 12:09.680
Took a lot of casualties.

12:09.812 --> 12:12.349
Sounds like you deserve a medal for even
coming through that, Colonel Baines.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.439
| agree. But Goff wasn't there.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.190
Where was he?

12:16.319 --> 12:18.310
He was doing recon
in the Kabul Dwarza district.

12:18.446 --> 12:21.234
It's a click away. That's where
the |IED took him out.

12:21.366 --> 12:23.027
Did you explain this
to Sergeant Goff's widow?

12:23.159 --> 12:24.741
Repeatedly. But she kept writing.

12:24.869 --> 12:27.657
She's not the first widow that wants
recognition for her husband,

12:27.789 --> 12:29.120
but facts are facts.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.411
After some time,
| had to stop responding.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.374
Were there any other witnesses
to this firefight?

12:33.503 --> 12:34.493
Just Corporal Mankiewicz.

12:34.629 --> 12:37.496
He's the one that put the idea
of a medal in her ear.

12:40.551 --> 12:42.087
So where's Corporal Mankiewicz now?

12:42.220 --> 12:45.258
[Aaron] He's dead, sir. He committed
suicide a year after leaving the service.

12:45.390 --> 12:48.724
Well, according to this,
he was the only potential witness left.

12:48.851 --> 12:50.057
So I guess that's that, then.

12:51.354 --> 12:53.061
Mike, is there something
you want to add?

12:53.189 --> 12:56.102
-It's not appropriate, sir.
-It is if I'm asking.

12:56.234 --> 12:58.316
It's just... that was Goff's unit.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.731
It doesn't make sense he'd be
a click away from his men

13:00.863 --> 13:03.150
if they were expecting hostiles,
which they would've been.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.149
So you think Colonel Baines is mistaken.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.617
In my opinion, sir.

13:07.745 --> 13:09.247
[sighs]

13:09.372 --> 13:10.908
Mike served six years Special Forces.

13:11.040 --> 13:14.908
If he doesn't think something's adding up,
something's not adding up.

13:15.044 --> 13:16.375
-Dig deeper, Aaron.
-Yes, sir.

13:16.504 --> 13:18.791
-Emily, can I borrow you?
-Of course, sir.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.755
They've been banging the drum
on this all week.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.044
Yeah, the media's picked it up,

13:22.176 --> 13:24.554
which is why Foerstel is trying
to induce Alex to testify now.

13:24.679 --> 13:27.671
He knows the heat's turning up. He's
trying to take advantage of the timing.

13:27.807 --> 13:31.266
| got a message from his office today.
He has an update for us

13:31.394 --> 13:33.226
on the Cincinnati area
police abuse investigation.

13:33.354 --> 13:36.096
-Why? That's been dormant for months.
-I know. The timing's odd.

13:36.232 --> 13:39.975
No, it's not. He wants to talk
off the record about my wife's subpoena.

13:40.111 --> 13:42.068
That's why he contacted you
instead of Kendra.

13:42.196 --> 13:44.779
-Do you want me to take the meeting?
-Yes.

13:44.907 --> 13:47.160
The second he talks about Icarus,
walk away.

13:47.285 --> 13:49.777
| don't want this office to even have
the slightest appearance

13:49.912 --> 13:52.620
-of trying to obstruct this investigation.
-Understood.

13:52.749 --> 13:53.910
Thank you.

13:58.379 --> 13:59.756
Mr. Director.

13:59.881 --> 14:01.087
Thank you for meeting me.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.468
| understand you have an update
on the Cincinnati investigation?

14:03.593 --> 14:04.674
Yes.

14:04.802 --> 14:08.261
My considered opinion is
there may have been wrongdoing.

14:08.890 --> 14:10.676
Serious wrongdoing.

14:10.808 --> 14:15.177
And our opinion is that the facts to date
don't remotely support that conclusion.

14:15.313 --> 14:18.271
It's a provisional opinion, which is why
the investigation has to continue.

14:18.399 --> 14:21.141
Despite the fact that you're chasing what
any objective observer would describe

14:21.277 --> 14:23.314
as innuendo, wild conspiracy theories.

14:23.446 --> 14:25.938
All investigations chase those things
until they disclose the truth.

14:26.074 --> 14:29.612
Or turn up nothing. Meanwhile, damage
is done to those you're investigating.

14:29.744 --> 14:31.109
Damage that may be irreparable.

14:31.245 --> 14:33.156
If the subjects of this
investigation are innocent,

14:33.289 --> 14:34.950
-there won't be any damage.
-[scoffs]

14:35.083 --> 14:36.994
We both know that's not true,
Mr. Director.

14:37.126 --> 14:40.585
Reputations can be harmed.
Institutions eroded.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.454
That's not my concern.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.957
Is that what you want me
to tell the President?

14:47.261 --> 14:50.219
Tell him Cincinnati is not personal.

14:50.348 --> 14:52.965
It's professional. And that I owe
a duty to the American people

14:53.101 --> 14:56.469
to follow this to the end of the line.
No matter what.

15:05.655 --> 15:08.238
Foerstel wanted to meet with me
to underscore he wouldn't stand down.

15:08.366 --> 15:10.733
-[Tom] Didn't think he would.
-[Lyor] And here's why.

15:10.868 --> 15:12.859
The media is covering
the Icarus investigation now,

15:12.995 --> 15:16.204
which means he's staking his
professional credibility on the outcome.

15:16.332 --> 15:17.993
Not a problem
if you're a career civil servant.

15:18.126 --> 15:20.083
-Which he is.
-But not for long.

15:20.211 --> 15:21.701
| played a hunch, sir.

15:21.838 --> 15:23.875
| reached out to a source
in Albany, where he's from,

15:24.006 --> 15:26.589
and it turns out, he formed
an exploratory committee

15:26.717 --> 15:29.630
for a 2018 New York Senate run,
right when the Icarus investigation began.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.220
And that's not all. He has a secret PAC
in the works, too.

15:32.348 --> 15:34.055
They've already raised
half a million dollars.

15:34.183 --> 15:36.220
And he's doing it all
on the back of the investigation.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.309
We know how much
you respect process, sir,

15:38.438 --> 15:41.601
so we are recommending that you appoint
a special prosecutor to investigate.

15:41.732 --> 15:43.598
-A special prosecutor?
-[Lyor] Yes, sir.

15:43.734 --> 15:45.145
It doesn't end the Icarus investigation.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.894
It simply removes Foerstel
from the equation.

15:47.029 --> 15:49.236
Which we believe is in the best interest
of the White House

15:49.365 --> 15:52.448
-now that he may have ulterior motives.
-Ambition is not an ulterior motive.

15:52.577 --> 15:55.239
It's a by-product of the work
that gets done in this town,

15:55.371 --> 15:57.328
and no one's immune.
Present company included.

15:57.457 --> 16:00.245
-Sir--
-With regards to a special prosecutor,

16:00.376 --> 16:02.583
history tells me that
they're runaway trains.

16:02.712 --> 16:05.249
One investigation turns into another,
et cetera, et cetera.

16:05.381 --> 16:06.587
Way too risky.

16:06.716 --> 16:09.299
It's the lesser of the two evils, sir.
A risk we can manage.

16:09.427 --> 16:12.340
Emily, I get it.
I'll take it under advisement.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.430
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Mr. President.

16:19.562 --> 16:21.974
[indistinct conversations]

16:26.569 --> 16:28.810
Hey. So, Three-Letter Day, huh?

16:28.946 --> 16:30.857
-Yeah, Three-Letter Day.
-Wait. Hang on.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.606
Um... can I talk to you?

16:32.742 --> 16:33.948
-I-I've got a thing. I...
-Look.

16:34.076 --> 16:35.817
Um, |-I actually have a thing, too, okay?

16:35.953 --> 16:38.820
It's called walking on egg shells,
which is what I feel like I've been doing

16:38.956 --> 16:40.333
the last couple days.

16:40.458 --> 16:43.200
I'm just wondering if you told
the President that I got arrested

16:43.336 --> 16:44.451
for covering up my brother's drugs

16:44.587 --> 16:47.625
and what that means for me,
because I'm kind of also obsessed

16:47.757 --> 16:49.464
with this other thing
called job security.

16:49.592 --> 16:51.754
It's an evolving situation.

16:52.428 --> 16:53.839
Evolving. Got it.

16:54.597 --> 16:55.803
Yeah.

16:55.932 --> 16:57.548
Okay, that's also a thing.

16:57.683 --> 16:58.935
Ah.

17:01.938 --> 17:04.646
Interesting fact. A colony rears
several queens at once.

17:04.773 --> 17:08.392
The first queen that hatches stings
the others to death in their cells.

17:08.528 --> 17:12.192
If two emerge at once,
they fight until one is killed.

17:12.323 --> 17:13.779
It's just like an election, Seth.

17:17.828 --> 17:19.535
[Eddie] I didn't set out
to be an apiarist.

17:19.664 --> 17:22.781
It began as a hobby. And then
before I knew it, I had three colonies.

17:22.916 --> 17:23.998
Hmm.

17:24.126 --> 17:26.413
-Their upkeep must take a lot of time.
-Well, yes.

17:26.546 --> 17:29.629
But I now harvest $4,000 a month
worth of honey from my hives.

17:29.757 --> 17:32.374
That's excellent.
So, uh, how can we help?

17:32.510 --> 17:34.592
Eddie thinks the FAA
is killing our bees.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.212
Really? How?

17:37.348 --> 17:40.386
Well, that new Air Route
Surveillance Radar facility,

17:40.518 --> 17:43.180
it opened around
the time of the die-off.

17:43.312 --> 17:45.599
Bees navigate using magnetic fields.

17:45.731 --> 17:48.393
| think the radar is disrupting that.

17:48.526 --> 17:51.359
-Are they flying into trees?
-[Lyor] No, Seth.

17:51.487 --> 17:54.900
They're insects, not imbeciles.
They use a solar compass to navigate.

17:55.032 --> 17:57.524
Disrupt that, you compromise
their spatial memory.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.409
[sighing]
They can't find their food.

18:00.538 --> 18:02.529
You must be a fellow melittologist.

18:02.665 --> 18:05.578
| dabble. So you've spoken
with the A.R.S.R.?

18:05.710 --> 18:07.872
Yes. I told them that
two of my three colonies

18:08.004 --> 18:10.792
had been completely wiped out,
but they ignored me.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.631
And that's why I wrote
the President a letter.

18:13.759 --> 18:16.717
-Eddie's very proactive.
-Well, so is the White House.

18:16.846 --> 18:18.883
We really didn't mean to put you
to all this trouble.

18:19.015 --> 18:20.631
Oh, no, no. The trouble will be the FAA's.

18:20.766 --> 18:23.178
Tell apis cerana to stand by.
Help's on the way.

18:24.687 --> 18:27.224
Uh, we'll, uh, be in touch.

18:29.025 --> 18:30.936
[laughs]

18:32.194 --> 18:34.902
[Lyor] Interesting fact.
Bees never sleep.

18:35.031 --> 18:35.987
| don't care.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.072
They're the only insect
that produces food for humans.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.407
- I still don't care.
-Oh.

18:40.536 --> 18:42.118
You've been stung, haven't you?

18:42.246 --> 18:44.783
Hey, Ms. Slater.
Seth Wright. This is Lyor Boone.

18:44.915 --> 18:46.076
Thank you so much for coming.

18:46.208 --> 18:47.619
On behalf of the FAA,

18:47.752 --> 18:49.584
we're thrilled the President
has an interest in aviation.

18:49.712 --> 18:51.749
Oh, he doesn't.
His interest is in bees.

18:51.881 --> 18:53.042
Oh, God.

18:53.174 --> 18:56.257
-Not that Eddie guy again.
-You remember him?

18:56.385 --> 18:59.753
As the Administrator of the A.R.S.R.,
| have a hard time forgetting someone

18:59.889 --> 19:02.096
| nearly had to get
a restraining order against.

19:02.224 --> 19:04.090
The letters, the calls, the pickets.

19:04.226 --> 19:07.093
-All of which you ignored.
-No, we didn't.

19:07.229 --> 19:11.723
We tried to reach an amicable settlement,
but the problem resolved itself.

19:11.859 --> 19:13.190
At least I thought it did.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.435
-Who told you that?
-Helen Adamson.

19:18.115 --> 19:19.071
His wife.

19:23.412 --> 19:24.948
[Hannah] That's her.
Chandler's daughter.

19:25.081 --> 19:29.325
Ms. Dern. I'm Hannah Wells, FBI.

19:29.460 --> 19:31.417
This is Kendra Daynes,
the White House Counsel.

19:31.545 --> 19:33.707
-I left you a few messages.
- have nothing to say to you.

19:33.839 --> 19:37.127
It's about your dad.
You remember him, don't you?

19:37.802 --> 19:39.509
Winter Haven.
You spend a lot of time there?

19:39.637 --> 19:42.220
-Please leave me alone.
-Did you write to us about your dad?

19:42.348 --> 19:45.466
-No.
-Tracy, we work for the White House.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.763
If your dad is innocent, we can save him.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.681
If you know something
that could help us prove--

19:49.814 --> 19:52.476
| don't. Now, please. Just let me go.

19:57.738 --> 19:59.354
[engine starts]

20:00.825 --> 20:02.816
She couldn't even look us in the eye.

20:02.952 --> 20:04.818
Could be a guilty conscience.

20:04.954 --> 20:06.194
But let's play it out. Okay?

20:06.330 --> 20:07.991
She's a strung-out teen
back in the day.

20:08.124 --> 20:10.866
Somehow got mixed up
in the Ketamine buy, the agent's death.

20:11.001 --> 20:13.709
Her dad takes the fall for her.
When he's looking at his last meal,

20:13.838 --> 20:15.704
she finally caves.
Writes a letter to save his life.

20:15.840 --> 20:18.582
I'll find out if she has a rap sheet,
any prior drug convictions.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.335
Okay. I have to meet Agent Rennett
about the First Lady's case.

20:21.470 --> 20:23.507
-See you in the White House in an hour?
-Will do.

20:23.639 --> 20:25.801
-Call you as soon as I hear something.
-Okay.

20:26.976 --> 20:29.013
-Hey.
-You've been scarce.

20:29.812 --> 20:33.350
-Yeah, it's Three-Letter Day.
-Is that some sort of postal holiday?

20:33.482 --> 20:37.100
No, it's... What do we have
on the banker?

20:37.236 --> 20:39.978
Our Mr. Lang has dual citizenship.
St. Lucia and the U.K.

20:40.114 --> 20:41.730
Multiple passports.

20:41.866 --> 20:43.732
He landed here
using his St. Lucia passport.

20:43.868 --> 20:46.610
Used his British one to pass
into Canada a few days ago.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.283
He's exploiting multiple identities
so we can't catch him in real time.

20:49.415 --> 20:51.873
Good way to stay one step ahead
of the banking regulators.

20:52.001 --> 20:54.208
By the time our systems update,
he could be in Kathmandu.

20:54.336 --> 20:55.417
We have to find him.

20:55.546 --> 20:57.878
He is the First Lady's last hope
to avoid the FBI inquiry.

20:58.007 --> 20:59.714
-[cellphone rings]
-Yeah?

20:59.842 --> 21:01.583
Alfonso Lang has a condo in Georgetown

21:01.719 --> 21:03.630
he leases through
a closely held corporation

21:03.763 --> 21:05.720
called Montserrat Alliance.

21:05.848 --> 21:07.759
-I'm texting you the address.
-Chuck, we don't even know

21:07.892 --> 21:10.554
-that he's in the country.
-I do. I can trace a purchase

21:10.686 --> 21:12.268
to a company credit card 90 minutes ago.

21:12.396 --> 21:15.479
-A massage parlor in Dupont.
-Thanks, Chuck.

21:15.608 --> 21:18.441
Lang's local.
Chuck is texting us the deets.

21:18.569 --> 21:21.402
If we can get Lang to confess
that he was working at Lloyd's behest

21:21.530 --> 21:24.397
to make it look like the First Lady
was getting a payola from Icarus,

21:24.533 --> 21:26.149
-we can clear her name.
-Great.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.026
I'm gonna hit the loo.
I'll see you in a second.

21:37.004 --> 21:39.041
[tires squeal]

21:39.882 --> 21:42.965
[engine revs]

21:44.261 --> 21:45.922
[panting]

21:54.647 --> 21:56.103
You got a partial plate?

21:56.232 --> 21:57.393
First three letters.
Chuck's running it.

21:57.525 --> 22:00.517
-There's a lesson here, you know?
-What's that?

22:00.653 --> 22:03.145
You shouldn't beat up bankers
without me, especially bankers

22:03.280 --> 22:05.612
-that want to frame the First Lady.
-Yeah?

22:05.741 --> 22:08.108
You think you could've gotten
out of the way of that car?

22:08.244 --> 22:11.157
Nope. I would've shot the guy
before he got in it.

22:13.457 --> 22:14.788
Mr. Lang?

22:14.917 --> 22:16.453
Hannah Wells. FBI.

22:16.585 --> 22:18.542
[television chatter]

22:18.671 --> 22:20.332
TV's on.

22:21.131 --> 22:22.872
You sure it's not someone
calling for help?

22:23.008 --> 22:25.170
Exigent circumstances.
No need for a warrant.

22:25.302 --> 22:27.088
You really have been here too long.

22:28.597 --> 22:30.133
I've been here longer.

22:34.937 --> 22:36.769
Hello?

22:37.606 --> 22:38.516
Mr. Lang?

22:42.278 --> 22:45.145
[microwave beeping]

22:45.281 --> 22:46.942
We just missed him.

22:48.450 --> 22:50.282
Someone tipped him off.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.986
[Aaron] Colonel Baines, we have
more questions about Kandahar.

22:53.122 --> 22:55.363
Those are the GPS coordinates
of Sergeant Goff's phone

22:55.499 --> 22:57.240
during the battle in which he was killed.

22:57.376 --> 23:00.164
[Emily] You know what's interesting
about these coordinates, Colonel?

23:00.296 --> 23:02.503
They put Sergeant Goff
smack in the middle of the battle,

23:02.631 --> 23:05.214
-not a click away doing recon.
-That's the information I had.

23:05.342 --> 23:07.333
Well, let me show you
the information we have.

23:07.469 --> 23:09.847
This is a divorce filing.

23:09.972 --> 23:13.556
Your divorce filing, and it lists
adultery as the grounds.

23:13.684 --> 23:15.721
An affair your wife had
with Sergeant Goff.

23:15.853 --> 23:19.062
Filing a false report
is a court-martial offense.

23:19.189 --> 23:22.181
Dishonorable discharge, prison time.
But I don't need to tell you that.

23:22.318 --> 23:23.774
No, you don't.

23:23.903 --> 23:26.144
So you are going to amend your statement
of Sergeant Goff's conduct

23:26.280 --> 23:27.691
and you'll include a recommendation

23:27.823 --> 23:30.064
that he be posthumously
awarded the Medal of Honor.

23:32.995 --> 23:34.030
Okay.

23:35.831 --> 23:37.617
I'll do that.

23:37.750 --> 23:40.708
-Thank you.
-And I won't leave out any of it;

23:40.836 --> 23:42.952
not how he betrayed my trust,

23:43.088 --> 23:44.704
or seduced my wife,

23:44.840 --> 23:47.298
or ruined my marriage, or any of it.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.087
And his grieving widow
can frame my statement

23:49.219 --> 23:50.550
right next to his Medal of Honor.

23:55.392 --> 23:59.056
So both of you disagree
with regards to Sergeant Goff?

23:59.188 --> 24:00.223
Yes.

24:00.356 --> 24:02.893
We both agree he should be recognized
for his valor.

24:03.025 --> 24:05.232
Yeah, but medals are
for the living, not the dead.

24:05.361 --> 24:06.317
They provide comfort.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.402
And if we award this medal
to Sergeant Goff,

24:08.530 --> 24:10.737
his wife will also learn
about his infidelity.

24:10.866 --> 24:13.654
And I disagree. These inquiries
have a narrow focus:

24:13.786 --> 24:15.902
to determine the facts
on the battlefield.

24:16.038 --> 24:18.245
-Which deserve commendation.
-Yes.

24:18.374 --> 24:21.241
Once you start factoring extraneous
personal circumstances into the mix--

24:21.377 --> 24:23.744
A medal is about extraneous
personal circumstances,

24:23.879 --> 24:25.665
what it will mean to the next of kin.

24:25.798 --> 24:28.415
| think the greatest gift we can give
the next of kin is the truth.

24:31.387 --> 24:35.426
| would like to meet with Mrs. Goff
and her son here in the Oval Office.

24:35.557 --> 24:37.139
Absolutely.

24:38.227 --> 24:40.059
Sir, may I address another matter?

24:40.187 --> 24:42.929
Sure. What is it?

24:43.065 --> 24:45.306
I'm here championing
for transparency.

24:45.442 --> 24:47.433
And I'm ashamed to admit
that I haven't been

24:47.569 --> 24:50.903
as transparent with you as I should have
been regarding a personnel issue.

24:51.949 --> 24:53.735
I'm listening.

24:54.326 --> 24:55.612
[exhales deeply]

24:55.744 --> 24:58.611
A few days ago,
Seth was arrested and charged with--

24:58.747 --> 25:00.488
| already know about it.

25:01.500 --> 25:02.706
You do?

25:02.835 --> 25:04.451
The District of Columbia D.A.

25:04.586 --> 25:06.293
He's a friend of mine.
We play cards together.

25:06.422 --> 25:08.413
He told me as soon
as I got back from Kabul.

25:09.758 --> 25:12.045
| am sorry we didn't have
this conversation sooner.

25:12.177 --> 25:14.214
So am I.

25:14.346 --> 25:16.804
But the point is,
we're having it now.

25:16.932 --> 25:19.014
| know that the White House
is like a family,

25:19.143 --> 25:21.475
and I can't even imagine
how difficult it is for you sometimes

25:21.603 --> 25:24.095
-in the trenches with everyone.
-Yes, sir.

25:24.231 --> 25:25.813
But the truth is, you work for me,

25:25.941 --> 25:28.308
and I can't do my job
when I'm kept in the dark.

25:29.194 --> 25:32.858
| rely on you to counsel me
through these kinds of matters.

25:33.615 --> 25:35.026
Understood.

25:35.492 --> 25:37.153
Having said that...

25:42.666 --> 25:44.782
What do you think
| should do about Seth?

25:50.132 --> 25:50.917
[sighs]

25:51.050 --> 25:53.792
[bees buzzing]

25:56.138 --> 25:59.221
[Lyor] Look at them.
So innocent, so vulnerable.

25:59.349 --> 26:00.965
[Seth] They're bees, Lyor.

26:01.351 --> 26:02.933
Wait, Lyor. Hold on.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.769
She accused Helen Adamson.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.353
Justice must be done, Seth.

26:06.482 --> 26:07.893
Hey, wait, wait, wait. Lyor.

26:08.025 --> 26:10.187
-Lyor, relax.
-I am relaxed.

26:10.319 --> 26:13.687
Relaxed as someone about to confront
a woman over apicide can be.

26:13.822 --> 26:14.937
[doorbell rings]

26:15.074 --> 26:16.530
-That's not a word.
-Yes, it is.

26:16.658 --> 26:18.695
-We don't know she killed the bees.
-Yes, we do.

26:18.827 --> 26:21.660
-And you have to stop ringing the bell.
-No, I don't.

26:22.331 --> 26:24.993
Sorry. Just got out of the shower.

26:25.125 --> 26:26.536
Ma'am, we need to talk.

26:26.668 --> 26:28.796
Oh, okay. Eddie stepped out.

26:28.921 --> 26:30.707
-Just the three of us, then.
-No, that's okay.

26:30.839 --> 26:32.625
We can come back at a more
convenient time. Thank you.

26:32.758 --> 26:35.216
-No, I'll just be a minute. Come on in.
-Great.

26:37.513 --> 26:38.469
So, just make yourselves comfortable

26:38.597 --> 26:40.383
and I'll be right back down
after I change.

26:40.516 --> 26:42.848
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

26:47.231 --> 26:49.893
What are you doing? Hey!

26:52.027 --> 26:53.438
You realize this gives me
more evidence

26:53.570 --> 26:55.231
for your involuntary
commitment application.

26:55.364 --> 26:56.900
She killed the bees, Seth.

26:57.032 --> 26:58.568
-Thousands of them.
-No, she didn't.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.441
-The FAA did.
-Wrong.

27:00.577 --> 27:02.568
Two of the three colonies
collapsed completely.

27:02.704 --> 27:04.115
The third seems to be fine,

27:04.248 --> 27:06.330
which means that while the radar
may have weakened them,

27:06.458 --> 27:08.745
she applied the coup de grace.

27:12.381 --> 27:13.416
And this was it.

27:17.427 --> 27:20.260
Helen Adamson is the colony
collapse disorder.

27:20.389 --> 27:23.302
Okay, Animal Planet, you want
to slow down and take me through it?

27:23.433 --> 27:26.095
This is royal jelly, Seth, a massive
amount. You take too much

27:26.228 --> 27:28.595
from the hive, the queen stops laying.
The larvae starts dying.

27:28.730 --> 27:31.017
-Why would she kill the bees?
-[scoffs] Jealousy.

27:31.150 --> 27:33.687
Have you seen the house? It's a shrine
to bees. A glorious shrine.

27:33.819 --> 27:35.981
She gets rid of the bees,
she gets her husband back?

27:36.113 --> 27:39.401
Yes, except he's going to leave
when he learns she's a serial killer.

27:39.533 --> 27:40.864
Whoa. He's not learning
anything, okay?

27:40.993 --> 27:42.859
Our remit is to save the bees,
not wreck their marriage.

27:42.995 --> 27:45.453
Oh, no, we're going to save the bees
by wrecking the marriage.

27:45.581 --> 27:47.163
No, no, no, listen.
| have a plan, okay?

27:47.291 --> 27:49.783
It will save your precious little bees
and the federal government

27:49.918 --> 27:51.454
from an alienation of affection lawsuit.

27:51.587 --> 27:54.249
Now sit down, shut up,
and let me explain.

27:57.593 --> 27:59.834
Why do they call it the Oval Office?

27:59.970 --> 28:02.302
Because it's shaped like an oval.

28:02.431 --> 28:04.047
What's an oval?

28:04.183 --> 28:06.515
Sort of like a circle, but squished.

28:08.437 --> 28:10.144
-Is there a triangle office?
-[chuckles]

28:10.272 --> 28:13.014
-Danny, that's enough questions.
-No, it's fine.

28:13.150 --> 28:16.438
No, there isn't, but it would be
really cool if there was.

28:16.570 --> 28:18.106
Why don't we have a seat?

28:22.201 --> 28:25.865
Mrs. Goff, I am very sorry,
but I am not gonna be able

28:25.996 --> 28:28.112
to present your husband with the medal.

28:28.957 --> 28:31.119
Our investigation was inconclusive.

28:31.627 --> 28:33.368
<i>Memories fade, witnesses disappear,</i>

28:33.503 --> 28:37.497
and obviously there's a very high
standard of proof for this sort of thing.

28:38.967 --> 28:40.549
| understand, sir.

28:40.677 --> 28:42.008
| asked you both here today

28:42.137 --> 28:45.505
because I wanted to present you
with this from me.

28:48.644 --> 28:50.726
And I wanted to talk to you, Danny,

28:51.480 --> 28:53.221
about your father.

28:55.651 --> 28:56.482
Okay.

28:56.610 --> 28:59.398
| want you to know
how brave he was.

29:01.156 --> 29:04.365
And that there are people alive today
because of what your father did.

29:04.493 --> 29:05.699
That's what made him a hero.

29:07.829 --> 29:09.695
My dad was brave.

29:11.333 --> 29:12.744
Yes, he was.

29:13.669 --> 29:15.080
Very.

29:15.212 --> 29:17.749
And if anyone asks you
how you know that,

29:18.799 --> 29:21.666
| want you to tell them that the
President of the United States told you.

29:27.182 --> 29:28.593
Thank you.

29:29.559 --> 29:31.220
No.

29:31.353 --> 29:32.764
Thank you.

29:34.564 --> 29:38.057
We're pleased to report that the FAA
has agreed to redirect its radio waves

29:38.193 --> 29:40.901
so that your colonies are
no longer affected, Mr. Adamson.

29:41.029 --> 29:42.235
-Really?
-[Lyor] Yes.

29:42.364 --> 29:44.981
So we anticipate a resurgence
in your bee population.

29:45.117 --> 29:47.028
A robust resurgence.

29:47.160 --> 29:49.868
See, Helen?
| told you President Kirkman cared.

29:49.997 --> 29:52.614
Oh, actually, the person you should be
thanking is your wife.

29:52.749 --> 29:54.911
She's the one who brought
the FAA to heel.

29:55.043 --> 29:56.249
| don't know what to say.

29:56.378 --> 29:59.370
-Well, we'll let you say it in private.
-No, wait.

30:01.341 --> 30:04.925
I'm ashamed of my behavior.

30:05.053 --> 30:07.465
I've repaid my wife's devotion
with treachery,

30:07.597 --> 30:09.929
and I want to confess it
in front of everyone here.

30:10.058 --> 30:10.889
Eddie?

30:11.018 --> 30:12.759
-We should go, Lyor.
-Shh.

30:12.894 --> 30:13.929
[Eddie] Your roses?

30:14.062 --> 30:15.769
-The ones the deer ate?
-[Helen] What about them?

30:15.897 --> 30:17.604
It wasn't the deer.

30:17.733 --> 30:20.600
-I... I poisoned them.
-What?!

30:20.736 --> 30:22.693
-Now, Lyor.
-You're being rude, Seth.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.482
This man wants to unburden himself.

30:24.614 --> 30:26.992
They were drawing them away
from better food sources.

30:27.117 --> 30:29.950
| was desperate.
Oh, God, I... I am so sorry.

30:30.078 --> 30:31.284
[Helen] I'm sorry, too.

30:31.413 --> 30:32.995
That I didn't Kill
more of those parasites.

30:33.123 --> 30:35.660
-You killed my bees?
-Not enough of them, you bastard.

30:35.792 --> 30:37.123
[Eddie] You murderer!
[Helen] You're the murderer!

30:37.252 --> 30:39.118
-Now we can go.
[Eddie] My mother was right about you.

30:39.254 --> 30:40.494
[Helen] Speaking of
someone I want to kill.

30:40.630 --> 30:41.961
[Eddie] Don't you dare mention her name.

30:42.090 --> 30:43.956
[Helen] I should've married Lance
Burlington when I had the chance.

30:44.092 --> 30:45.423
[Eddie] Lance? Please!

30:50.474 --> 30:52.431
Wait, someone tried to run you down?

30:52.559 --> 30:55.221
It's an occupational hazard.
I'm fine. Talk to me.

30:55.354 --> 30:56.970
| checked Tracy in the system.
No record.

30:57.105 --> 30:59.483
But I got a hit from another Dern,
her brother Frank.

30:59.608 --> 31:02.316
-What's his collar for?
-Drug conviction in 2001.

31:02.444 --> 31:04.651
Six months after
his dad's conviction.

31:04.780 --> 31:06.487
Misdemeanor possession
of - get this -

31:06.615 --> 31:07.525
Ketamine.

31:07.657 --> 31:09.739
Which was a rare designer drug
back in 2001.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.825
Meaning if Chandler Dern
was trying to cover for someone,

31:11.953 --> 31:13.614
it wasn't his daughter.

31:13.747 --> 31:16.114
-Keep each other posted.
-Right. Deal.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.912
Is the President going to pardon me?

31:19.044 --> 31:22.503
-Not unless you tell the truth.
-I've been telling the truth for 16 years.

31:22.631 --> 31:25.498
-I'm innocent.
- Ibelieve you.

31:25.634 --> 31:28.171
And I also believe you know who's not.

31:28.303 --> 31:30.795
This is the arrest record
for your son Frank.

31:32.391 --> 31:34.007
What does that have to do
with anything?

31:34.142 --> 31:35.644
We both know
what happened that night.

31:35.769 --> 31:38.682
Your son tried to buy Ketamine.
It went wrong.

31:38.814 --> 31:41.021
-He killed Carl Marley.
-That's a lie.

31:41.149 --> 31:42.605
And you took the fall.

31:42.734 --> 31:44.270
And you made your daughter
keep the secret.

31:44.403 --> 31:46.019
And it destroyed her.

31:46.154 --> 31:48.191
But she kept faith with you.

31:49.408 --> 31:52.776
Until she couldn't anymore because
she didn't want to watch her father die.

31:52.911 --> 31:56.449
If you think I'm gonna give up my son,
you must not have children.

31:56.581 --> 31:58.959
Sir, you've been tried
and convicted for this crime.

31:59.084 --> 32:01.872
No prosecutor on Earth will try
to charge Frank for this now,

32:02.003 --> 32:03.869
let alone try to convince a jury
to convict him.

32:04.005 --> 32:05.291
But the world will know.

32:05.424 --> 32:09.042
Mr. Dern, if you want
the President to pardon you,

32:09.177 --> 32:12.215
he needs to hear the truth
from your lips.

32:14.599 --> 32:18.263
| regret the damage done to Tracy
more than anything.

32:18.395 --> 32:22.639
And I would gladly die
if it would make her whole again.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.356
But I can't help her now.

32:25.694 --> 32:28.402
| can help Frank.

32:28.530 --> 32:29.486
He has a life,

32:29.614 --> 32:33.573
and I will sacrifice mine
so that he can keep his. Guard!

32:35.245 --> 32:37.236
[door lock buzzes]

32:40.208 --> 32:40.993
-[knocks on door]
-Hey.

32:41.126 --> 32:43.242
-Hey, uh, I'm busy, Seth.
-This will just take a second.

32:43.378 --> 32:44.618
| just wanted to let you know

32:44.754 --> 32:46.461
that I've decided to offer
the President my resignation.

32:46.590 --> 32:48.080
What?

32:48.216 --> 32:50.503
I've been skulking around here
the last two days, Emily.

32:50.635 --> 32:54.094
| know he knows I've been arrested.
| can see it in the way he looks at me.

32:54.222 --> 32:56.680
| can hear it in his tone.
He put me on bee patrol.

32:56.808 --> 33:00.426
-He cares about bees.
-Bee patrol with Lyor.

33:01.730 --> 33:02.640
Yeah.

33:02.772 --> 33:05.855
I'm in the doghouse, Em,
and I don't know how to get out.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.816
So I figure I'll offer him
my resignation.

33:07.944 --> 33:09.855
If he accepts,
| know I'm good, and if not--

33:09.988 --> 33:12.571
-He's not gonna accept it.
-How do you know that?

33:15.952 --> 33:18.660
Because I told him to fire you.

33:18.788 --> 33:20.244
And he declined.

33:22.542 --> 33:24.658
-I had to be objective, Seth.
-No, I know.

33:24.794 --> 33:26.626
And an objective Emily
would view your behavior

33:26.755 --> 33:28.291
as disloyal to this place.

33:28.423 --> 33:32.007
You compromised the one person
you can't compromise,

33:32.135 --> 33:34.513
-and you did it willingly.
-I know.

33:34.638 --> 33:35.628
[sighs]

33:36.806 --> 33:38.592
And you compromised me.

33:40.268 --> 33:41.474
And I've...

33:41.603 --> 33:45.847
I've looked at this every which way
since it's gone down.

33:45.982 --> 33:48.940
| mean, I've reconsidered every option.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.814
And here's where I come out.

33:53.615 --> 33:55.447
| would do it again

33:55.951 --> 33:58.818
because Michael's my brother,
and I protect my family.

33:59.412 --> 34:00.823
| know.

34:01.456 --> 34:04.039
And that's exactly
why he won't fire you.

34:04.793 --> 34:08.536
But you get one "get out of jail free"
card with him, and you just used it.

34:10.130 --> 34:11.667
So what now?

34:12.592 --> 34:14.128
Come here.

34:23.186 --> 34:25.928
Now go forth and sin no more.

34:26.063 --> 34:27.179
Thanks.

34:27.315 --> 34:29.976
For what? Trying to get you fired?

34:30.819 --> 34:32.856
For always doing the right thing.

34:37.033 --> 34:40.492
[sighs]
The right thing to do.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.411
[sighs]

34:43.540 --> 34:46.373
Sometimes it seems impossible
to even know what that is anymore.

34:46.501 --> 34:47.786
Yes, sir.

34:47.918 --> 34:49.956
Your case summary
makes it perfectly clear

34:50.088 --> 34:51.704
that Mr. Dern covered for his son.

34:53.882 --> 34:56.716
In his mind, trying to protect his family.

34:56.844 --> 34:58.586
However misguided,

34:59.514 --> 35:01.801
| don't think anyone
deserves to die for that.

35:01.933 --> 35:03.890
| agree, sir.

35:04.019 --> 35:06.386
But the fact remains
there's a dead federal agent

35:06.521 --> 35:08.262
whose murderer
is walking the streets

35:08.398 --> 35:10.435
because Mr. Dern chose
to obstruct justice.

35:10.567 --> 35:12.524
And he has to pay for that.

35:16.156 --> 35:18.523
But not with his life.

35:18.783 --> 35:20.239
So you're commuting his sentence.

35:20.368 --> 35:21.529
Yes, but not his conviction.

35:21.661 --> 35:25.495
He will spend his life in prison
unless he chooses to tell the truth.

35:25.624 --> 35:26.705
[phone beeps]

35:26.833 --> 35:30.121
Can you please patch me through
to the penitentiary? Thank you.

35:33.882 --> 35:36.419
[Chuck] The car that nearly hit you
was a silver sedan,

35:36.551 --> 35:38.417
<i>Maryland plates that start with SKA.</i>

35:38.553 --> 35:40.385
| was able to narrow it to 19 people.

35:40.513 --> 35:43.050
Did you cross-reference this list
with connections to Alfonso Lang?

35:43.183 --> 35:44.344
Yeah. Nothing.

35:44.476 --> 35:46.342
What about the Federal Bank of St. Lucia?

35:46.478 --> 35:48.936
Ran that search too. Nada.
I'll run a deeper search.

35:49.064 --> 35:51.305
Look for even tangential contacts
between these people and Icarus,

35:51.441 --> 35:53.978
Patrick Lloyd. 19 cars is a lot of cars.

35:54.110 --> 35:56.101
Yeah, it's a lot of cars.

35:56.237 --> 35:58.103
But the person who tried to take me out

35:58.239 --> 36:01.152
would want to make sure
that this car wasn't traced back to them.

36:01.868 --> 36:04.530
You know what's interesting
about this list?

36:04.663 --> 36:07.451
One of the cars on it was in an accident
three days ago.

36:11.795 --> 36:13.627
-Where are you going?
- I got a hunch.

36:13.755 --> 36:16.122
And if I'm right,
I'll know who tried to kill me.

36:20.762 --> 36:22.753
[Frank] That's good work, boys.
See you tomorrow.

36:25.767 --> 36:27.007
Agent Wells.

36:27.143 --> 36:29.134
| assume you heard about
your father's commutation.

36:29.270 --> 36:31.523
| did. Thank you for all your work.

36:31.648 --> 36:34.015
-It's, um, it's been a great relief.
-I'm sure it is.

36:34.150 --> 36:37.768
It would be a terrible thing to watch him
die for a murder you committed.

36:40.281 --> 36:43.319
- Don't know what you're talking about.
-Drop the act, Frank.

36:43.451 --> 36:45.317
We both know you're never
going to answer for it,

36:45.453 --> 36:46.705
but you will answer for something.

36:46.830 --> 36:47.865
You're making a big mistake.

36:47.997 --> 36:51.331
No, you did, when you used one of the cars
that your shop was repairing

36:51.459 --> 36:53.166
to try and kill me.

36:53.294 --> 36:56.912
We know you were driving the car, Frank.
Your office manager saw you get into it.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.550
-She's mistaken.
-Put your hands up.

36:58.675 --> 36:59.961
On the car. Now!

37:01.136 --> 37:03.002
Saving your dad meant
that I would ruin your reputation,

37:03.138 --> 37:05.049
so you tried to run me down.
Well, guess what.

37:05.181 --> 37:09.140
It's been 16 years, but you're finally
going to jail, you son of a bitch.

37:16.985 --> 37:17.895
[knock on door]

37:18.027 --> 37:19.984
[Ava] Mr. President,
| have the First Lady for you.

37:20.113 --> 37:21.274
Thank you, Ava.

37:21.406 --> 37:23.738
Hey. I was just heading up
to the Residence.

37:23.867 --> 37:25.403
| know. This couldn't wait.

37:25.535 --> 37:27.867
-You need to fire John Foerstel.
-Why?

37:27.996 --> 37:30.829
Because he is using his office
to create headlines for himself.

37:30.957 --> 37:34.075
He is purposely muddying the waters
for potential political gain.

37:34.210 --> 37:35.951
He's betraying his oath of office, Tom.

37:36.087 --> 37:37.919
-That is why.
-Alex, it's not that easy.

37:38.047 --> 37:41.381
Yes, it is. Patrick Lloyd has been dead
for two months,

37:41.509 --> 37:43.170
and we are still
being haunted by him.

37:43.303 --> 37:46.591
The fabricated bank account,
the... the conspiracy with Icarus

37:46.723 --> 37:48.213
that doesn't even exist.

37:48.349 --> 37:50.602
-None of this is real.
- I know.

37:50.727 --> 37:53.094
Why are you letting us
get dragged down by an investigation

37:53.229 --> 37:54.936
when you can do
something about it?

37:55.064 --> 37:57.772
My staff wants me to appoint
a Special Prosecutor.

37:57.901 --> 38:00.734
You want me to fire Foerstel.
All of you are missing the point.

38:00.862 --> 38:02.523
What is the point, Tom?

38:02.655 --> 38:04.646
The point is that your mother
committed a federal crime.

38:04.783 --> 38:05.989
-Oh!
-30 years ago maybe,

38:06.117 --> 38:07.949
but she committed a crime,
and there are consequences,

38:08.077 --> 38:10.330
and I can't just change the rules
because it suits us.

38:10.455 --> 38:13.413
John Foerstel is preparing
to run for Senate.

38:13.541 --> 38:16.329
-He is not playing by the rules.
-Yes, he is, damn it!

38:16.461 --> 38:19.954
And he's doing his job.
Maybe not the way we want him to.

38:20.089 --> 38:23.252
But I can't fire him for that.
And if I did, who would I be?

38:24.552 --> 38:26.134
My husband.

38:31.392 --> 38:32.723
Wow.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.894
| can't believe you just said that.

38:38.066 --> 38:39.602
You're questioning
my commitment as a husband

38:39.734 --> 38:41.441
because I won't interfere
in an investigation

38:41.569 --> 38:44.436
where we've done
absolutely nothing wrong?

38:44.572 --> 38:46.483
You're a hell of a lawyer, Alex.

38:46.616 --> 38:48.573
But you are a lousy defendant.

38:53.122 --> 38:57.616

Uh-oh.

-Yep.

-Burning the midnight oil, Chuck?
-[Chuck] Yeah. Listen. I got something.

39:27.699 --> 39:29.861
| ran Lang's cellphone. You were right.

39:29.993 --> 39:33.406
Somebody called him right before
you got to his condo. From a burner.

39:33.538 --> 39:35.575
-Do we know who it was?
-No.

39:35.707 --> 39:38.495
But I triangulated the signal
based on the cellphone towers.

<i>The call came from Fourth and H.
222 p.m.</i>

39:45.300 --> 39:47.132

I'll meet you there.

39:48.136 --> 39:50.002
[Chuck] Hannah? Are you there?

39:50.138 --> 39:51.799
Yeah.

39:52.515 --> 39:54.176
Thanks, Chuck.
I'll talk to you soon.

39:56.477 --> 39:59.310
[Damian] Hey, what's it gonna be?
Work or pleasure?

40:03.985 --> 40:05.475
Pleasure.
