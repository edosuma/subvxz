01:30.240 --> 01:31.707
Mama.

01:34.320 --> 01:37.221
Too close, he finds him a bore.

01:38.440 --> 01:40.146
Smiling distance.

01:43.160 --> 01:45.185
5 minute warning.

01:46.640 --> 01:47.820
Nurse Appleyard!

01:47.920 --> 01:50.900
- I've got to go Rosie, I'm late for John.
- Millie, please.

01:55.200 --> 01:58.351
It's Mr Donaldson,
I don't know what's happening.

02:03.760 --> 02:07.380
Get Dr Stroud, he'll be on his way out
heading for the Masons Arms on Praed Street.

02:07.480 --> 02:09.061
And wear that.

02:09.880 --> 02:11.586
Run, Rosie.

02:12.040 --> 02:14.144
Signor De Gasperi.

02:14.280 --> 02:19.500
In drinking to your health
and that of the whole Italian nation

02:19.600 --> 02:22.120
I am mindful that the first people

02:22.220 --> 02:27.308
to conquer these islands in 43 AD

02:27.408 --> 02:29.340
we British have long memories, you know

02:29.440 --> 02:31.510
were the Romans.

02:31.680 --> 02:36.260
Men from your country
built a better way of law and order.

02:36.360 --> 02:39.830
A land free from barbarism.

02:40.200 --> 02:42.820
And gave us hot baths.

02:42.920 --> 02:47.460
Which, throughout my long
and not uneventful life

02:47.560 --> 02:52.580
I have, as my wife would confirm,
partaken twice a day.

03:05.160 --> 03:06.582
Thank you.

03:07.160 --> 03:09.389
I'm sorry you missed John.

03:09.640 --> 03:13.383
He'll see more than enough of me
when we're married.

03:14.400 --> 03:16.660
I dunno what I'm gonna do
when you're in Australia.

03:16.760 --> 03:18.705
Well, I've not gone yet.

03:19.680 --> 03:21.625
I just panicked in there.

03:22.880 --> 03:24.711
Don't blame yourself.

03:25.880 --> 03:27.950
We did everything we could.

03:29.240 --> 03:31.390
Everyone has their time.

03:34.120 --> 03:39.780
We who have lived
through two terrible wars

03:39.880 --> 03:45.307
and now live in the precarious days
of the hydrogen bomb

03:45.920 --> 03:51.980
understand the need to build
a lasting peace between nations.

03:52.080 --> 03:57.700
Therefore, at the Bermuda conference
this summer, I will seek American support

03:57.800 --> 04:00.780
for my personal approach to secure peace

04:00.880 --> 04:04.429
with the new leaders of Soviet Russia

04:05.240 --> 04:07.344
in this, in, in these...

04:07.560 --> 04:08.900
Po...

04:09.000 --> 04:10.467
Our po...

04:10.680 --> 04:12.420
In uh, post...

04:14.960 --> 04:17.827
Post-Stalin days.

04:18.399 --> 04:22.019
And in the spirit of peace,
I give you Signor De Gasperi

04:22.120 --> 04:24.100
and the nation of Italy.

04:24.200 --> 04:27.431
Signor De Gasperi and the nation of Italy.

04:31.240 --> 04:32.483
Ladies and gentlemen,

04:32.583 --> 04:36.836
the Prime Minister invites you
to retire to the state drawing room.

04:39.360 --> 04:42.180
- Prime Minister, are you alright?
- What?

04:42.280 --> 04:43.660
Glass of water, perhaps.

04:43.760 --> 04:47.309
- Would you excuse me for just one moment?
- Yes.

04:49.440 --> 04:51.340
Was I laplump? Was I la...

04:51.440 --> 04:53.260
- Were you what, sir?
- The sp, spe...

04:53.360 --> 04:55.908
The speech went very well, sir.

04:57.640 --> 04:59.027
Are you alright?

04:59.640 --> 05:02.108
- Darling?
- Uh, yes, darling?

05:02.240 --> 05:04.071
Would you excuse me a moment?

05:08.600 --> 05:11.460
- Christopher, don't let the waiters in.
- Of course.

05:11.560 --> 05:15.587
Winston, do you think
you're able to stand up?

05:16.720 --> 05:19.700
- He needs an ambulance, Mama.
- He needs his doctor.

05:19.800 --> 05:24.271
Get Lord Moran, Jock, make our excuses
to the Italians and clear the house.

05:24.640 --> 05:26.551
What Italians?

05:26.800 --> 05:31.225
Just hold my hand, Winston, hmm?
Just hold my hand.

05:36.400 --> 05:39.460
Would you give his apologies to De Gasperi
and get them to leave.

05:39.560 --> 05:41.107
Of course.

05:41.800 --> 05:45.782
- Rab.
- Jock, what's going on?

05:46.080 --> 05:47.940
We've got the Americans on the phone, Rab

05:48.040 --> 05:49.860
and we could do with
clearing the house, actually.

05:49.960 --> 05:51.791
Would you give Christopher a hand?

05:53.000 --> 05:54.501
Thanks.

07:05.480 --> 07:07.300
- Lord Moran.
- Jock.

07:07.400 --> 07:10.221
We've been trying you all night, Charles.
Where the hell have you been?

07:10.360 --> 07:14.103
Sussex. Just got your message
half an hour ago, what's happened?

07:24.760 --> 07:26.671
Lord Moran, Prime Minister.

07:33.840 --> 07:35.227
Good morning, Winston.

07:36.680 --> 07:38.140
How are you feeling?

07:38.240 --> 07:41.027
I was thinking about Bermuda.

07:43.240 --> 07:47.426
Let's get you just sitting down, shall we?

07:49.520 --> 07:53.380
- Where exactly is it?
- Not my subject, I'm afraid.

07:53.480 --> 07:55.903
Just sitting, sitting on the edge.

07:56.160 --> 07:59.106
On the edge, that it.
Good, good, gently.

07:59.480 --> 08:02.260
- How are you feeling?
- Good, good.

08:02.360 --> 08:05.940
Now, Winston, could you,
could you just grasp my fingers here?

08:06.040 --> 08:07.020
Just here.

08:07.120 --> 08:10.820
And with this hand,
with your left, that's good.

08:10.920 --> 08:14.220
- Where are my cufflinks?
- You're wearing them, Winston.

08:14.320 --> 08:15.662
Ah.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.940
I'm sure it's just tiredness.

08:20.040 --> 08:23.980
He's exhausted, Mary. He's 78.

08:24.080 --> 08:27.026
And being Foreign Secretary as well
while Eden's ill.

08:28.600 --> 08:31.380
- What's his first appointment?
- Cabinet at 11.

08:31.480 --> 08:32.947
Cancel it.

08:33.159 --> 08:36.345
I think we should wait
for Lord Moran's report.

08:39.039 --> 08:43.299
- Could you raise both arms for me?
- If I must.

08:43.400 --> 08:46.300
Raise them both, gently, good.

08:46.400 --> 08:49.949
Both arms, Winston, both arms.

08:50.760 --> 08:53.388
Both, yes, good.

08:53.560 --> 08:56.791
Good. That's fine, now, just relax,
just drop. Now...

08:57.480 --> 08:59.860
Do you remember a few years back

08:59.960 --> 09:03.828
you found it difficult
to squeeze the paint out of the tubes?

09:04.720 --> 09:09.270
- The Monte Carlo clutch, yes.
- Well, this could be the same.

09:09.920 --> 09:11.421
Well, just give me a pill.

09:11.840 --> 09:14.740
You put in up in Monte Carlo
with your red pills.

09:14.840 --> 09:18.150
Yes, well, I'll give you something, but...

09:18.960 --> 09:24.102
then you must rest up
'til we find out what's going on.

09:55.560 --> 10:00.270
Very nice. I like to be serenaded
when I'm working.

10:01.560 --> 10:05.980
Now the brain is a very delicate
and complicated thing.

10:06.080 --> 10:07.580
Billions of connections.

10:07.680 --> 10:09.380
Billions!

10:09.480 --> 10:13.427
- Very precise, is that a medical term?
- No, behave.

10:14.160 --> 10:20.269
If my brain's got billions of connections,
then quite a few will still be working.

10:21.760 --> 10:26.740
I've only ever needed half a dozen
to take a cabinet meeting.

10:29.080 --> 10:31.548
What did the Americans want last night?

10:32.040 --> 10:33.746
Nothing serious.

10:33.960 --> 10:37.340
Eisenhower wanted to go through
the social arrangements.

10:37.440 --> 10:39.780
A little bird tells me Moran is here.

10:39.880 --> 10:42.860
Yes. Just routine.

10:47.320 --> 10:52.100
He's an old man, Chris.
We love him, but it's time he stood aside.

10:52.200 --> 10:55.740
Let Eden take the strain,
for his own good, as well as the party's.

10:55.840 --> 10:58.100
But Anthony's in no shape
to take over at the moment, is he?

10:58.200 --> 11:00.862
He's in America,
getting his gall bladder fixed.

11:01.960 --> 11:03.580
Your man's sicker than Winston.

11:03.680 --> 11:05.740
He'll be alright after
he's been under the knife.

11:05.840 --> 11:08.786
- And when is that?
- Tonight.

11:20.800 --> 11:24.700
- Is the Bermuda conference first?
- Fourth, Prime Minister.

11:24.800 --> 11:29.460
Korea first, then German elections,
then commercial television.

11:29.560 --> 11:32.984
- Stay close.
- Let's let them in.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.786
Is it another stroke?

11:44.040 --> 11:46.060
That's what I suspect.

11:46.160 --> 11:50.620
Now, he needs complete rest,
so this Bermuda trip next week is perfect.

11:50.720 --> 11:53.460
Three weeks at sea, no distractions.

11:53.560 --> 11:57.348
- I'll go and see him.
- I'm afraid he's taking cabinet.

11:58.120 --> 12:00.507
- You let him take cabinet?
- I couldn't stop him.

12:00.607 --> 12:02.980
He's your patient, Charles!
It's your job to stop him.

12:03.080 --> 12:05.025
There was nothing I could do.

12:05.640 --> 12:08.347
There was just one other thing.

12:08.880 --> 12:10.461
He was singing.

12:10.920 --> 12:12.420
- Singing?
- Yeah.

12:12.520 --> 12:14.670
"I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles".

12:17.800 --> 12:19.611
The thing to stress in Bermuda,
Prime Minister,

12:19.711 --> 12:22.406
is that your approach
will not be seen as unilateral.

12:22.520 --> 12:25.700
If they see is as a personal crusade
by yourself, they'll block it.

12:25.800 --> 12:29.260
But it has to presented
as a united diplomatic effort.

12:29.360 --> 12:31.669
Obviously. What's next?

12:34.400 --> 12:36.940
- They are onto Bermuda now.
- That's more than halfway through.

12:37.040 --> 12:38.660
Seems to be going smoothly
as far as we can tell.

12:38.760 --> 12:40.140
What's he got for the rest of the day?

12:40.240 --> 12:43.980
We've cancelled the German trade lunch,
so Prime Minister's questions at 2

12:44.080 --> 12:46.820
- which we hope he'll be alright for.
- What if he isn't?

12:46.920 --> 12:49.787
What if he starts singing
in front of the whole house?

12:50.480 --> 12:54.109
Charles is recommending
complete rest, so...

12:54.320 --> 12:57.983
I'm taking him away today
to where he'll be properly looked after.

12:59.120 --> 13:01.580
I suppose we could say he's gone
to Chequers early to prepare for the summit.

13:01.680 --> 13:02.660
No.

13:02.760 --> 13:06.981
You can't get away from anything there,
I'm taking him home.

13:23.200 --> 13:24.861
Chartwell?

13:26.640 --> 13:29.980
Millie, there's a policeman
from the special branch with Dr Strand.

13:30.080 --> 13:33.504
- They want to see you.
- Me?

13:59.880 --> 14:01.222
Where are we going?

15:02.640 --> 15:06.622
Priorities on my desk
and the rest over there.

15:09.360 --> 15:12.943
Hello? We've arrived.
Start putting the calls through.

15:41.160 --> 15:42.380
Who are you?

15:42.480 --> 15:44.220
Er, Nurse Appleyard.

15:44.320 --> 15:46.231
Ah, yes.

15:46.680 --> 15:50.343
Follow me.
We haven't much time I'm afraid.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.746
Oh, thank you.

16:03.560 --> 16:06.500
This is her ladyship's bedroom
and is strictly off limits

16:06.600 --> 16:08.940
as is the library and the office beyond.

16:09.040 --> 16:11.020
His studio's at the back where he paints

16:11.120 --> 16:13.668
but I don't imagine he'll be
doing much of that this weekend.

16:16.400 --> 16:17.660
Where who paints?

16:17.760 --> 16:19.860
- You signed the Act?
- I don't know.

16:19.960 --> 16:22.340
I signed something.
Those men wouldn't speak to me.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.140
You signed the Official Secrets Act

16:24.240 --> 16:27.060
which means that any discussion
of this assignment anywhere, ever

16:27.160 --> 16:29.981
will be severely punished.
Do you understand?

16:33.920 --> 16:36.468
Bedroom and study are through here.

16:52.480 --> 16:54.820
- Do you want to see his bedroom?
- Excuse me, Mr er...

16:54.920 --> 16:56.831
- Colville.
- Colville.

16:57.680 --> 16:59.102
Who lives here?

16:59.720 --> 17:01.260
The Prime Minister.

17:01.360 --> 17:03.146
He'll be here within the hour.

17:17.119 --> 17:21.864
The Prime Minister has had a mild stroke.
You're here to look after him for a few days.

17:22.160 --> 17:23.582
Why me?

17:24.000 --> 17:26.423
I've been asking myself
the same question, Miss Appleyard.

17:27.480 --> 17:28.822
Wait.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.500
I can't nurse him in here, it's too small.

17:31.600 --> 17:34.140
I need to be able to get round
both sides of the bed.

17:34.240 --> 17:36.663
I want the bed moved
into this bigger room.

18:08.960 --> 18:11.060
Oh, God! Charles!

18:11.160 --> 18:12.786
- Darling?
- Support his head, Clemmy.

18:12.960 --> 18:13.820
- That's it, good.
- Darling.

18:13.920 --> 18:16.343
Drive on quickly as you can, Sergeant,
we're almost there.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.106
Any minute now.

18:22.640 --> 18:24.551
You're gonna think I'm a bit daft.

18:25.760 --> 18:27.102
What?

18:29.000 --> 18:30.865
Will he mind I didn't vote for him?

18:38.840 --> 18:40.705
- Nurse, quickly.
- Oh, take his weight.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.420
Arm under his shoulder.

18:42.520 --> 18:44.863
- Sergeant. There.
- Yep.

18:45.760 --> 18:47.260
Mind his arm.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.827
Gently with him.

18:57.240 --> 18:59.310
I'll take his head.

19:00.360 --> 19:02.589
Get his feet.

19:03.040 --> 19:04.621
And round.

19:05.840 --> 19:08.183
Thank you gentlemen, some privacy please.

19:18.840 --> 19:20.671
- How bad is it?
- Shh.

19:22.360 --> 19:24.380
- Charles.
- Heart is struggling.

19:24.480 --> 19:27.108
Circulation is very poor.

19:32.280 --> 19:34.748
He may not last the weekend.

20:34.960 --> 20:37.349
Jock, will you give me a hand
with the boxes?

20:38.960 --> 20:40.541
How is he?

20:41.200 --> 20:44.140
- What?
- He, um... they had a difficult journey.

20:44.240 --> 20:45.980
I'm so sorry, Mary.

20:46.360 --> 20:49.067
- Have you told anybody?
- Nobody.

21:14.360 --> 21:17.101
Why has his bed been moved in here?

21:19.120 --> 21:21.941
It's easier for us to attend to him.

21:24.160 --> 21:25.991
What happened, Charles?

21:26.480 --> 21:30.666
I suspect he has had a more severe stroke.

21:34.360 --> 21:36.350
And will he be alright?

21:37.600 --> 21:39.261
Tell me the truth.

21:40.640 --> 21:43.795
If he regains consciousness at all

21:43.895 --> 21:48.619
he may suffer paralysis and brain damage

21:49.760 --> 21:52.786
and there is also the risk
of heart failure.

21:59.720 --> 22:01.426
Oh, Papa...

22:08.920 --> 22:10.980
The Prime Minister wasn't
in the house this afternoon

22:11.080 --> 22:13.300
because he is preparing
for his voyage to Bermuda, Stephen.

22:13.400 --> 22:16.740
No, no, Lord Moran's
visit to Downing Street

22:16.840 --> 22:19.740
was a routine check-up
before such a long journey.

22:19.840 --> 22:23.900
Soames. Christopher Soames.
I don't know, I'll have to ask Mr Colville.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.380
Thank you, Steve, one minute please.

22:25.480 --> 22:28.700
Downing Street want to confirm
the travel arrangements to Bermuda.

22:28.800 --> 22:31.746
He'll get back to you. Later on.

22:32.240 --> 22:34.180
We need to let the Americans know first
he isn't making Bermuda.

22:34.280 --> 22:36.660
The minute you do that,
everyone will know he's sick.

22:36.760 --> 22:38.785
Moran thinks he's dying.

22:38.920 --> 22:40.148
What?

22:42.360 --> 22:44.942
We have to decide what we're
going to tell the press.

23:04.080 --> 23:05.581
Mama.

23:16.120 --> 23:18.463
Well, you've seen him?

23:20.120 --> 23:21.428
Yes.

23:30.720 --> 23:33.348
I want us all together, here.

23:33.520 --> 23:36.421
I don't want the family
reading about it in the papers.

23:38.200 --> 23:40.190
I'll telephone the others now.

23:58.320 --> 23:59.580
Hello, Express?

23:59.680 --> 24:01.989
Lord Beaverbrook's office, please.

24:02.440 --> 24:05.660
I don't care, the Prime Minister wants
to speak to him, just put him through.

24:05.760 --> 24:08.500
This is the Prime Minister's
parliamentary private secretary.

24:08.600 --> 24:10.226
Which theatre?

24:10.800 --> 24:12.940
The Savoy.
No, I'll do it myself, thank you.

24:13.040 --> 24:14.780
Jock, which telephone can I use?

24:14.880 --> 24:16.060
Er, you can use one of mine.

24:16.160 --> 24:19.660
The message reads: "Urgent, the Prime
Minister requires your immediate presence

24:19.760 --> 24:20.820
tonight at Chartwell."

24:20.920 --> 24:22.020
Pimlico, double 3, double 2.

24:22.120 --> 24:24.224
That's it. Thank you.

24:27.320 --> 24:31.347
Piccadilly 8000 please.
The Savoy concierge.

24:31.520 --> 24:34.751
Diana? It's Mary.

24:45.400 --> 24:48.949
- What are you doing?
- His left side is very weak.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.548
I feel that working the muscles might...

24:53.280 --> 24:57.910
encourage better blood flow
and maybe improve his chances of recovery.

24:59.240 --> 25:02.061
At the very least,
it must be comforting to be touched.

25:18.640 --> 25:20.027
Christopher.

25:23.680 --> 25:26.581
- "Operation Hope Not."
- His funeral.

25:31.480 --> 25:32.500
What's this?

25:32.600 --> 25:34.860
The only precedent
was the Duke of Wellington's.

25:34.960 --> 25:38.191
It was the Queen's personal suggestion
that we base it on that.

25:39.640 --> 25:41.551
Was the name your idea?

25:42.640 --> 25:44.027
Afraid so.

25:49.280 --> 25:51.225
Lords of the press.

25:53.280 --> 25:57.068
We'll see them in the studio,
we don't want Lady Churchill disturbed.

25:58.880 --> 26:00.666
Look at them.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.461
Who?

26:03.000 --> 26:04.547
The cronies.

26:04.840 --> 26:07.946
Gathering at the deathbed of their leader.

26:09.280 --> 26:11.987
Thank you. I'll sit with him now.

26:12.440 --> 26:14.146
I won't go far.

26:21.760 --> 26:24.620
I got your cloak-and-dagger summons, Jock

26:24.720 --> 26:27.220
and I thought either Winston's
been a Communist spy all along

26:27.320 --> 26:29.180
or he's dying. Which is it?

26:29.280 --> 26:32.431
My lords, if you'd like to step this way
we can use the studio.

26:50.520 --> 26:52.385
I'll just be a moment.

26:57.000 --> 27:00.583
I live in fear of being given
one of his paintings as a gift.

27:07.640 --> 27:09.780
Is Winston joining us?

27:09.880 --> 27:11.267
No.

27:45.120 --> 27:49.180
If Winston is dying, we'll have to pull
the morning editions, I need a telephone.

27:49.280 --> 27:51.860
Max, please, at the moment
we don't know anything for sure.

27:51.960 --> 27:52.820
We know enough.

27:52.920 --> 27:55.500
I'm asking, we are asking, that you wait.

27:55.600 --> 27:57.540
- We think that's what he'd want.
- To gag us.

27:57.640 --> 28:00.140
Only until the situation is clearer.

28:00.240 --> 28:03.940
It is impossible to make a proper
diagnosis until he comes round.

28:04.040 --> 28:05.780
And what if The Mirror sniffs something?

28:05.880 --> 28:09.380
They'd be only too happy to report
a headless government in crisis.

28:09.480 --> 28:12.020
That's why you're here,
to make sure that doesn't happen.

28:12.120 --> 28:13.524
What about Eden?

28:13.624 --> 28:16.327
- Do we know how his operation went?
- I've got a man at the hospital.

28:16.427 --> 28:20.460
So have I but without Winston
and with Eden out of the running

28:20.800 --> 28:21.660
you've got no-one.

28:21.760 --> 28:25.380
Maybe a caretaker government for 6 months,
under Lord Salisbury?

28:25.480 --> 28:26.867
Are you serious?

28:27.320 --> 28:28.740
He'd have a general election in a week.

28:28.840 --> 28:31.547
This is why the party
needs more time, Max.

28:44.440 --> 28:47.102
Nurse! Nurse!

28:47.960 --> 28:50.303
Nurse, he's choking!

28:53.920 --> 28:55.910
He's swallowed his tongue.

29:01.960 --> 29:03.621
Take a breath.

29:07.960 --> 29:09.666
Right, let's get him up.

29:13.240 --> 29:14.548
There you go.

29:16.080 --> 29:17.220
What about the cabinet?

29:17.320 --> 29:19.500
- Rab will inform them in the morning.
- And parliament?

29:19.600 --> 29:21.886
- No plans to tell them.
- This is bullshit.

29:21.986 --> 29:25.982
I know the constitution's not written down,
but you're trampling all over it.

29:26.880 --> 29:28.940
Lord Moran, the Prime Minister's
regaining consciousness.

29:29.040 --> 29:30.427
Would you excuse me gentlemen?

29:31.320 --> 29:32.820
- Find out about Eden.
- Hmm.

29:32.920 --> 29:35.149
I'm going to see Winston.

29:51.520 --> 29:53.306
Latin, Winston?

29:53.760 --> 29:59.664
To show my mind hasn't gone.

30:00.120 --> 30:02.702
That's the last thing that will pack up.

30:04.520 --> 30:07.591
Shall we just step outside?

30:09.280 --> 30:11.270
No.

30:17.360 --> 30:20.545
I... I want...

30:21.120 --> 30:24.863
to know the truth.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.831
Your heart is very weak

30:31.000 --> 30:34.504
and there's a loss of sensation
on the left side.

30:34.840 --> 30:38.184
You're vulnerable to further strokes.

30:38.600 --> 30:39.942
Tell me.

30:40.280 --> 30:44.023
Am I dying, Charles?

30:46.200 --> 30:47.701
I don't know.

30:50.880 --> 30:52.506
Max.

30:53.160 --> 30:54.547
Max.

30:54.840 --> 30:56.705
Yes, my friend.

30:58.880 --> 31:00.740
How's Anthony?

31:00.840 --> 31:03.388
We're finding that out now, Winston.

31:03.840 --> 31:05.751
Give me time.

31:06.600 --> 31:08.181
Give me time.

31:09.560 --> 31:12.222
Please, for me.

31:13.840 --> 31:17.071
- I'll talk to the others.
- Thank you.

31:19.880 --> 31:21.347
How is he?

31:21.640 --> 31:25.300
Conscious, but very weak.

31:25.400 --> 31:31.540
His speech was hard to understand,
but his meaning was as clear as ever.

31:31.640 --> 31:32.540
How's Eden?

31:32.640 --> 31:35.660
There's no question of his returning
to public life before the autumn.

31:35.760 --> 31:39.580
So, we'll need to keep quiet
about this for longer than a few days.

31:39.680 --> 31:41.940
Maybe the whole summer
if Winston hangs on.

31:42.040 --> 31:47.620
Ministries will still need decisions from the
Prime Minister. How will we handle that?

31:47.720 --> 31:49.300
Rab will hold the fort with the cabinet.

31:49.400 --> 31:53.905
As for decisions, Christopher and I know
what we wants, I think we can make it work.

31:54.080 --> 31:56.540
He was going on holiday
after Bermuda anyway

31:56.640 --> 31:58.740
so if he pulls through, he can carry on.

31:58.840 --> 32:00.900
And no-one will be any the wiser.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.020
And do what exactly?

32:02.120 --> 32:05.620
Drag himself back to Westminster
half-paralysed, slurring his words?

32:05.720 --> 32:08.780
If he regains enough strength, Clemmy,
I know he still hopes

32:08.880 --> 32:10.380
to lead the way
to the end of the Cold War.

32:10.480 --> 32:11.580
What about his family?

32:11.680 --> 32:15.423
We don't want a man crippled with illness
who's worked himself to death.

32:15.960 --> 32:18.180
Don't you think we deserve
some time with him?

32:18.280 --> 32:20.420
- Clemmy...
- No.

32:20.520 --> 32:23.300
You've kept him propped up
on pills for years, Charles.

32:23.400 --> 32:28.380
If you have any love for him,
if any of you do, you would get him to stop.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.460
You would let him come home to his family.

32:30.560 --> 32:33.860
Winston has two families,
one at Westminster...

32:33.960 --> 32:36.740
He has one family, Max.

32:36.840 --> 32:39.260
He's given enough, we both have.

32:39.360 --> 32:41.140
We'll keep this quiet, one day at a time.

32:41.240 --> 32:45.820
I think we all want the same thing here,
just time for him to recover

32:45.920 --> 32:48.502
so he can make up his own mind.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.911
Don't you agree?

32:54.120 --> 32:56.100
A toast, to Winston...

32:56.200 --> 32:58.580
- To Winston
- ...and our country.

32:58.680 --> 33:00.341
Our country.

33:08.760 --> 33:11.388
What's your name?

33:12.800 --> 33:14.300
Nurse Appleyard, sir.

33:14.400 --> 33:19.542
No, not your rank. Your name.

33:22.480 --> 33:23.788
Millie.

33:27.440 --> 33:28.941
Minnie?

33:35.800 --> 33:38.029
- We'll talk in the morning.
- Fine, fine.

33:40.640 --> 33:43.142
Running the world on our own, then?

33:43.960 --> 33:45.950
So it would seem.

33:49.920 --> 33:51.500
Do you have family?

33:51.600 --> 33:53.306
Me Mum and Dad.

33:54.280 --> 33:57.101
And my fiancée.

33:57.360 --> 33:58.940
Although he's not family yet.

33:59.040 --> 34:00.746
What's his name?

34:01.000 --> 34:02.422
John.

34:03.880 --> 34:05.142
Well...

34:06.760 --> 34:09.945
this is our family.

34:12.199 --> 34:13.542
Diana...

34:14.280 --> 34:15.746
Sarah...

34:16.280 --> 34:17.179
Randolph.

34:17.280 --> 34:18.380
And that's Mrs Soames.

34:18.480 --> 34:21.505
No, Mary wasn't born then.

34:27.719 --> 34:31.746
- When are you getting married?
- We're going to emigrate to Australia.

34:32.400 --> 34:35.900
He's going in a few weeks and
then I'll join him. We plan to marry there.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.228
And start your family?

34:39.480 --> 34:40.788
In time.

35:16.360 --> 35:18.700
Will someone help me
with this silly thing, it's stuck.

35:18.800 --> 35:20.301
Diana?

35:24.400 --> 35:25.867
Thank you.

35:27.160 --> 35:28.547
How is he?

35:30.320 --> 35:31.940
He's much better today, actually.

35:32.040 --> 35:34.340
I thought Sarah was
supposed to be on that train.

35:34.440 --> 35:36.660
She missed it, I'm afraid,
we're going to have to wait for her.

35:36.760 --> 35:38.260
Where's Duncan?

35:38.360 --> 35:40.100
He's away, of course.

35:40.200 --> 35:44.022
I tried to telephone him first thing, but
he wasn't where he said he would be, and...

35:46.360 --> 35:50.140
I was thinking, on the train,
should I have brought the children?

35:50.240 --> 35:51.260
Better not.

35:51.360 --> 35:53.340
I've been keeping
Nicholas and Emma out of the way.

35:53.440 --> 35:56.546
Well, I did think about it.

36:26.800 --> 36:28.700
- I'll take it.
- They shall think you're moving in.

36:28.800 --> 36:31.620
I only just got back from Los Angeles,
I haven't had time to unpack.

36:31.720 --> 36:34.620
I thought you'd both stay
with Christopher and me down at the farm.

36:34.720 --> 36:37.461
I can't do that,
I've got to get back for the children.

36:38.760 --> 36:40.944
Oh, I'm dreading this.

36:49.680 --> 36:51.227
Thanks.

36:52.040 --> 36:55.589
- Hello, Mrs Pearson.
- Shh! Mama's sleeping.

36:55.960 --> 36:57.621
I'll let her know you're here.

37:09.680 --> 37:11.020
Jock.

37:11.120 --> 37:14.100
The spider emerges from his lair.

37:15.120 --> 37:16.380
Diana.

37:16.480 --> 37:17.583
Sarah.

37:21.520 --> 37:23.465
Do spiders have lairs?

37:25.160 --> 37:28.580
Let's just neaten you up a bit, shall we?
Make you presentable.

37:29.720 --> 37:31.267
Oh, here they are.

37:33.840 --> 37:35.580
He's expecting you.

37:37.560 --> 37:39.061
Papa.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.422
Papa...

37:42.640 --> 37:44.471
It's Diana.

37:44.880 --> 37:46.660
Puppy kitten...

37:46.760 --> 37:48.671
Puppy kitten, yes.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.581
And the mule is here, too.

37:51.240 --> 37:52.340
Hello, Papa.

37:52.440 --> 37:55.147
She only flew in from
America two days ago.

37:58.440 --> 37:59.980
Children...

38:00.080 --> 38:01.300
Children, no.

38:01.400 --> 38:04.020
...aren't here?

38:04.120 --> 38:07.100
No, I didn't bring the children.

38:07.440 --> 38:09.740
It's only me. I thought
the children would be too much.

38:09.840 --> 38:12.422
He wants to hold your hand.

38:31.480 --> 38:35.109
We all hope to see you
up and about soon, Papa.

38:35.640 --> 38:38.100
Amer...

38:38.200 --> 38:41.020
Americ...

38:41.120 --> 38:45.260
America? Oh, America was a great success.

38:45.360 --> 38:49.180
Your husband?

38:49.280 --> 38:54.740
Tony, oh, uh, Tony's doing okay,
he's directing television now.

38:54.840 --> 38:55.980
Ah.

38:57.680 --> 38:59.220
Ah, not a good time.

38:59.320 --> 39:00.700
No, it's not.

39:00.800 --> 39:06.943
I want to see him.

39:07.520 --> 39:10.620
Come on, Diana.
We'll come back soon, Papa.

39:10.720 --> 39:13.826
- We've only just arrived.
- Well, he wants to work.

39:16.480 --> 39:18.061
See you later.

39:26.320 --> 39:29.780
Well, it's past 12 and I need a drink.
What are you doing?

39:29.880 --> 39:33.300
Making breakfast for Mama,
she was up all night. How is he?

39:33.400 --> 39:35.340
He looked terrible and sounded worse.

39:35.440 --> 39:38.820
Ooh, olives. Who wants a dirty martini?

39:38.920 --> 39:40.220
- Yes, please.
- Ice?

39:40.320 --> 39:42.780
- Try the dining room.
- It's here.

39:42.880 --> 39:44.870
I've got the jug.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.300
- Is Randolph coming?
- This afternoon.

39:46.400 --> 39:49.060
I heard a very funny story about Randolph.

39:49.160 --> 39:52.220
Sarah Macmillan had some
guests for the weekend and suddenly

39:52.320 --> 39:53.780
one of them comes in and whispers

39:53.880 --> 39:58.220
' Randolph Churchill's in the hall' so,
they all peer round the door to have a look

39:58.320 --> 40:02.780
anyway, he's driven up, drunk as a skunk,
thought the house was an hotel

40:02.880 --> 40:06.740
marched in and ordered a gin
from one of Sarah's guests.

40:06.840 --> 40:08.540
- Who's this?
- Randolph at the Macmillans'.

40:08.640 --> 40:10.580
- He thought it was an hotel.
- What happened?

40:10.680 --> 40:14.980
Oh, he sat in the hall, drank it,
left a tip and drove off.

40:16.240 --> 40:18.420
Why didn't anybody say anything?

40:18.520 --> 40:20.863
- They're all petrified of him.
- I'm petrified of him.

40:21.560 --> 40:23.266
Just like the old man.

40:26.480 --> 40:28.584
I dread what life's
going to be like without him.

40:29.200 --> 40:30.986
To Papa.

40:32.240 --> 40:33.901
To Papa.

40:44.280 --> 40:45.747
Mama?

40:46.600 --> 40:47.820
Room service.

40:47.920 --> 40:49.626
Darling Mama.

40:50.280 --> 40:52.191
Darlings...

40:59.120 --> 41:01.748
- Is Randolph here?
- No, not yet.

41:01.880 --> 41:04.100
- When did you get back?
- Two days ago.

41:04.200 --> 41:05.860
You must be exhausted, darling.

41:05.960 --> 41:09.543
She missed the early train,
so she can't be that exhausted.

41:10.600 --> 41:12.220
How's your father this morning?

41:12.320 --> 41:14.860
He seemed more interested
in seeing Christopher than us.

41:14.960 --> 41:17.980
- It was frightening last night.
- Why, what happened?

41:18.080 --> 41:20.389
- That nurse saved his life.
- No, no.

41:20.600 --> 41:22.900
He just had a little trouble
breathing, that's all.

41:23.000 --> 41:26.740
I don't know what Christopher's doing,
Duncan doesn't even know that Papa's ill.

41:26.840 --> 41:28.980
He was told with the cabinet this morning.

41:29.080 --> 41:31.780
But it's important that we
keep this to ourselves.

41:31.880 --> 41:33.180
What about the papers?

41:33.280 --> 41:35.623
Your father spoke to Max last night.

41:35.920 --> 41:38.660
- Don't get crumbs on the bed, darling.
- Oh, sorry.

41:38.760 --> 41:40.860
Oh, I love Mrs Lace's marmalade.

41:40.960 --> 41:44.100
I want best behaviour, everyone.

41:44.200 --> 41:47.544
Your father must not be upset,
not when he's like this.

41:47.800 --> 41:52.620
I will have no raised voices
in this house, understand?

41:54.120 --> 41:58.020
I gave a professional medical opinion,
not a party press release

41:58.120 --> 42:00.622
that you can fiddle with
like some groggy little...

42:01.960 --> 42:04.900
- That is what?
- The disturbance of the cerebral circulation

42:05.000 --> 42:08.140
- that was the phrase I used.
- It was felt to be too strong, politically.

42:08.240 --> 42:10.424
Felt by who? By you?

42:10.640 --> 42:12.260
Politicians.

42:12.360 --> 42:16.860
"The Prime Minister has had no respite for
a long time and is need of complete rest."

42:16.960 --> 42:20.300
Well, it's piffle! It's no news that
the Prime Minister has been overdoing it.

42:20.400 --> 42:22.100
He's been overdoing it his entire life!

42:22.200 --> 42:26.386
If you want the Daily Mirror to smell
a rat, well, here's the cheese!

42:28.040 --> 42:28.780
Is that funny?

42:28.880 --> 42:31.620
Such a silly thing to say.

42:31.720 --> 42:33.346
Cheese?

42:33.800 --> 42:36.580
This is what Butler and Salisbury
wanted to put out.

42:36.680 --> 42:41.549
Well, I disassociate myself completely.
It misrepresents my professional opinion.

42:41.800 --> 42:42.700
Where are you going?

42:42.800 --> 42:44.506
Fresh air.

42:49.120 --> 42:51.260
This is from President Eisenhower.

42:51.360 --> 42:53.980
"Dear Winston,
I'm deeply distressed to hear

42:54.080 --> 42:57.060
your physicians have advised you
to lighten your duties

42:57.160 --> 43:01.180
I look upon this as a temporary deferment
of our meeting in Bermuda."

43:01.280 --> 43:02.180
Ah.

43:02.280 --> 43:05.511
"Your health is of great importance
to the world."

43:10.000 --> 43:11.342
Millie.

43:13.880 --> 43:15.381
What do you mean?

43:16.120 --> 43:17.985
Eisenhower.

43:18.560 --> 43:21.060
Eisenhower.

43:21.160 --> 43:24.061
Ike, he never wanted the conference.

43:24.720 --> 43:28.900
He doesn't believe that we can
talk our way to peace with the Russians.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.626
Say it again.

43:31.120 --> 43:35.180
Eisenhower.

43:35.280 --> 43:36.667
And again.

43:37.600 --> 43:41.582
Eisenhower.

43:53.080 --> 43:55.100
Leave that, we haven't finished.

43:55.200 --> 43:57.031
Oh, I'm sorry.

43:57.160 --> 43:59.822
I don't imagine you'd like one of these.

44:00.200 --> 44:02.740
- No, thank you.
- What's your name?

44:02.840 --> 44:04.580
Nurse Appleyard.

44:05.120 --> 44:07.065
What's he calling you?

44:08.000 --> 44:09.700
- Millie.
- Millie.

44:09.800 --> 44:13.110
Yes, I suppose you're in love with him.

44:13.320 --> 44:19.224
This house is normally crawling with Millies,
all busy with their little fantasies.

44:20.280 --> 44:22.942
- I should take this to him.
- I'm sorry.

44:23.160 --> 44:24.420
Don't be embarrassed.

44:24.520 --> 44:27.387
I'm not. But I should take this to him.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.500
Did you ever think of getting divorced?

44:34.600 --> 44:36.840
That's quite a question
to ask your mother.

44:36.940 --> 44:38.583
Sorry.

44:38.680 --> 44:41.387
I did think of not marrying him.

44:42.480 --> 44:44.580
When I finally accepted his proposal

44:44.680 --> 44:47.900
he promised he'd keep it a secret
until I'd told my mother.

44:48.000 --> 44:51.822
Within 5 minutes,
he told his whole family.

44:52.280 --> 44:57.308
I realised then that it was
always going to be all about him.

44:58.040 --> 45:01.510
And it's Wardle to Hassett
on the fifth ball of this over.

45:05.560 --> 45:10.543
Easily pushed out towards the Pavilion End.
And the umpire's signalling a four.

45:10.680 --> 45:13.620
For those of you who've just joined us
in this second test here at Lords

45:13.720 --> 45:16.427
the sun is shining on a capacity crowd...

45:17.160 --> 45:18.627
Hello?

45:19.520 --> 45:21.067
Hello?

45:22.120 --> 45:23.826
Hello?

45:24.160 --> 45:25.627
Randolph.

45:26.280 --> 45:27.180
Good of you to come.

45:27.280 --> 45:29.942
Why are you thanking me
for turning up to my father's deathbed?

45:30.360 --> 45:31.700
How's Eden?

45:31.800 --> 45:33.940
- It's touch and go.
- Well, why don't I know about this?

45:34.040 --> 45:36.020
Why doesn't the party know
the two pillars of government are down?

45:36.120 --> 45:39.500
- The situation is being handled.
- Bugger is it, it's being sat on.

45:39.600 --> 45:42.182
By greasy little
margarine-eaters like you.

45:42.920 --> 45:46.344
- Why is the house so silent?
- Your family are in the garden.

45:47.840 --> 45:49.944
Okay, you can go now.
Enjoy the cricket.

45:50.960 --> 45:54.380
Hello, Randolph. Your father's very tired,
I've just been with him.

45:54.480 --> 45:57.347
Could you wait
until he's slept a little...? No.

46:06.080 --> 46:08.100
Sir, he's too tired
to see anyone at the moment.

46:08.200 --> 46:11.226
- I'd like to be alone with him now, please.
- He needs to rest.

46:11.400 --> 46:13.390
You don't know who I am, do you?

46:14.120 --> 46:17.988
I don't care if you're the Queen of Sheba,
you're not going to disturb my patient.

46:22.440 --> 46:25.671
I'll sit. I shan't say a word.

46:40.280 --> 46:42.703
Has he been asking after me?

46:46.160 --> 46:47.866
Are you Randolph?

46:49.320 --> 46:50.901
Yes, he has.

47:01.640 --> 47:03.180
Marriage is like a garden.

47:03.280 --> 47:05.420
You have to work it through the winter

47:05.520 --> 47:09.340
or you don't get that gorgeous month
of rhododendrons in May.

47:09.440 --> 47:12.864
Or three weeks of... well.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.900
I trust you're appreciating the metaphor.

47:15.000 --> 47:18.260
I've sometimes felt more married to him
than I have to either of my husbands.

47:18.360 --> 47:20.862
- That's silly.
- No, it's not.

47:21.040 --> 47:24.350
There is no hiding from the world
who my father is.

47:25.280 --> 47:28.100
- So when did you get down?
- About an hour or so ago.

47:28.200 --> 47:29.622
He seems quiet peaceful.

47:30.520 --> 47:32.820
Colville was being preposterous as always.

47:32.920 --> 47:35.104
Why? He's just doing his job.

47:35.600 --> 47:37.431
It was simpler when we were children.

47:37.680 --> 47:40.460
But the minute we had our own ideas,
our own lives

47:40.560 --> 47:42.900
and we stopped worshipping him,
everything changed.

47:43.000 --> 47:46.635
- He loves you, he loves all of you.
- No, he loves you because he needs you,

47:46.735 --> 47:49.294
I don't know how much
he needs the rest of us.

47:50.600 --> 47:51.862
Sarah...

48:26.960 --> 48:31.220
- So, where did you stay there?
- Nicholas took that time...

48:31.320 --> 48:34.700
The Beverly Hills Carlton Hotel,
oh, Diana it's just marvellous.

48:34.800 --> 48:38.660
It had these hourglass pools,
parties every night.

48:38.760 --> 48:40.540
- Oh, darling, you must come.
- I'd love to.

48:40.640 --> 48:42.500
What are you two wittering on about?

48:42.600 --> 48:44.670
- You, Randolph.
- Are you?

48:51.560 --> 48:52.820
- I'm only asking.
- Charles has been there.

48:52.920 --> 48:55.460
He's been more than that,
Christopher's only trying to help.

48:55.560 --> 48:57.180
I'm only asking, I'm only asking.

48:57.280 --> 48:58.620
Thank you, Mrs Lacey.

48:58.720 --> 49:02.620
Mrs Lacey has gone to great trouble
in the last two days.

49:02.720 --> 49:04.460
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

49:04.560 --> 49:06.620
Well done for doing your job.

49:06.720 --> 49:09.302
Do you have to be so rude, Randolph?

49:16.720 --> 49:19.700
I think it'll be easier
for everyone if he dies.

49:21.800 --> 49:26.266
Well, Sarah can go off and marry any old
low-life she likes it'll be easier for you,

49:26.366 --> 49:29.300
you can move out of Downing Street
you can sell this place, which you hate.

49:29.400 --> 49:32.900
- And you bugger off to the south of France.
- That's a wicked thing to say about your father.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.940
I love my father, it was a wicked thing
to say about you. Get it right, dear.

49:36.040 --> 49:40.180
All the opportunities he's given you, all
the times he's helped to campaign for you!

49:40.280 --> 49:43.624
Not that you needed any help
losing elections, Randolph.

49:45.320 --> 49:49.460
And I suppose cos you've appeared in a
couple of films that no-one's even heard of

49:49.560 --> 49:51.100
that makes you an authority on success.

49:51.200 --> 49:53.540
Sarah received
very good notices for her...

49:53.640 --> 49:57.540
Well, we've all seen the notices
of Sarah in America, drunk in the street...

49:57.640 --> 49:58.420
Be quiet, Randolph.

49:58.520 --> 50:00.260
Brings disgrace on Papa.

50:00.360 --> 50:02.540
My mistakes reflect on me, not on Papa.

50:02.640 --> 50:06.460
You really are thick.
Everything we do reflects on him.

50:06.560 --> 50:09.188
Everything he does
reflects on us, we are...

50:09.520 --> 50:13.229
We're moons to the big planet,
we're one being.

50:13.800 --> 50:17.509
And now with him sick in there,
sick and dying

50:18.320 --> 50:20.026
with him near the end...

50:22.200 --> 50:24.702
with him near the end,
with him near the...

50:31.000 --> 50:35.061
I promised myself I would not cry
in front of you people.

50:36.200 --> 50:38.065
That's enough drink, Randolph.

50:39.440 --> 50:41.940
I'd really like to see you
try and stop me.

50:42.040 --> 50:44.140
- I know you would.
- You never stopped him drinking, did you?

50:44.240 --> 50:45.980
No, you just sit by.

50:46.080 --> 50:47.860
You sit by, that's what you do.

50:47.960 --> 50:51.180
And you watch the disasters unfold
like the lives of these two intellectuals.

50:51.280 --> 50:53.540
- Don't be so foul to Mama.
- Oh, Mrs Soames, shut up, Mrs Soames!

50:53.640 --> 50:54.420
And then you have the audacity to say...

50:58.440 --> 51:01.500
Randolph, please, none of this
is Mama's fault, you can't blame her

51:01.600 --> 51:03.180
- Isn't it?
- Oh, Diana, don't.

51:03.280 --> 51:08.100
Because she could have mothered us,
only she was too buy mothering Papa.

51:08.200 --> 51:09.820
He was her surrogate baby.

51:09.920 --> 51:12.548
And how is your psychoanalyst, Diana?

51:13.480 --> 51:15.220
- May I go and visit him?
- Not now, my darling.

51:15.320 --> 51:18.820
Look, here's the proof.
Have you seen the photographs of them?

51:18.920 --> 51:23.300
This one and this one and oh, this one.

51:23.400 --> 51:26.980
The adoring gaze, almost every picture

51:27.080 --> 51:31.220
but, it's the way a mother
looks at her child.

51:31.320 --> 51:32.580
- Sit down, Diana.
- No.

51:38.440 --> 51:40.460
- ...children, who we marry...
- You see what you've done?

51:40.560 --> 51:42.500
Sarah's marriage to Vic you dismissed.

51:42.600 --> 51:46.741
You called him a...
"a ridiculous little tinkerbell of a man."

51:46.960 --> 51:52.227
That was the man she wanted to spend
her life with! Who cares what you think?

51:54.280 --> 51:56.340
I don't even know
what "tinkerbell of a man" means.

51:56.440 --> 51:58.020
It means he's a fairy you half-wit.

51:58.120 --> 52:00.940
That's what she said
about the man you loved, Sarah.

52:01.040 --> 52:02.740
- Actually, it was Papa who said that.
- No!

52:08.520 --> 52:10.700
Well done for remembering something.

52:10.800 --> 52:13.980
I remember all of it Randolph,
every bit of it and so do you.

52:14.080 --> 52:17.380
Every bit of criticism,
every look of disappointment...

52:17.480 --> 52:20.140
I remember every single day.

52:20.240 --> 52:24.187
- Diana, this is not the time.
- Then when is the time, Sarah?

52:25.120 --> 52:26.507
When?

52:27.760 --> 52:31.740
I've been trying to say
these things for years now

52:31.840 --> 52:33.540
but nobody ever listens to me

52:33.640 --> 52:36.620
I don't care what you say about me,
I really don't

52:36.720 --> 52:41.430
but your father is lying next door
very sick, very sick.

52:41.640 --> 52:44.380
- Have some respect for him.
- She's just defending her baby again now.

52:44.480 --> 52:46.900
And what about everyone else
in this house?

52:47.000 --> 52:48.540
Do you want them to hear all this?

52:48.640 --> 52:50.660
Ooh, I wouldn't worry about them,
they'll love a bit of excitement

52:50.760 --> 52:52.940
they can scribble it in their diaries.

52:53.040 --> 52:54.900
Will you stop fiddling around, Mary.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.660
- They know not to keep diaries.
- Of course they...!

52:57.760 --> 52:58.540
Open your eyes!

53:00.280 --> 53:01.980
We need to stop this.

53:02.080 --> 53:04.180
I'll go and find Sergeant Murray.

53:04.280 --> 53:06.430
- I think you should leave.
- I know you do.

53:06.680 --> 53:09.900
- Jock will get you a...
- I don't need Jock to get me a bloody taxi!

53:10.000 --> 53:11.911
I think you do.

53:42.760 --> 53:44.540
Ooh, there's quite an audience here.

53:44.640 --> 53:46.100
Sarah, you can come and do your Desdemona.

53:46.200 --> 53:49.260
Randolph, please keep your voice down,
your father is sleeping in the...

53:49.360 --> 53:51.860
- I know where he is!
- Randolph.

53:51.960 --> 53:55.066
If you're going back to London,
let me drive.

53:55.840 --> 53:58.547
Tell Papa I love him.

54:00.680 --> 54:02.466
He knows you do.

54:05.320 --> 54:07.310
He'll kill himself
if he drives in that state.

54:07.720 --> 54:09.860
- Are you alright Mama?
- Mmm.

54:09.960 --> 54:11.700
Go after them.

54:22.800 --> 54:25.340
Randolph, let me take you back.

54:25.440 --> 54:26.540
Get a taxi.

54:26.640 --> 54:29.420
Come on darling. Come on, don't be silly.

54:29.520 --> 54:30.180
Get off, get off.

54:30.280 --> 54:32.066
- Jock.
- Don't let him drive.

54:32.280 --> 54:33.220
Get out of the way!

54:33.320 --> 54:35.504
This is ridiculous!

54:36.880 --> 54:37.820
Randolph...

54:37.920 --> 54:39.626
Out of the way!

54:40.240 --> 54:43.186
- Get that gate!
- Randolph!

54:46.080 --> 54:48.860
Open the gate, open the bloody gate!

54:48.960 --> 54:51.861
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

54:52.480 --> 54:53.740
Get out of the bloody way!

54:53.840 --> 54:56.229
Come on, darling, come on.

55:03.920 --> 55:05.421
- Have you got him?
- That's it, sir.

55:11.800 --> 55:13.347
Yes.

55:52.760 --> 55:54.625
Do you think he heard anything?

55:54.840 --> 55:58.105
I don't think so.
Nurse said he slept through.

55:59.920 --> 56:02.548
They are who they are.

56:03.440 --> 56:06.340
What's the phrase?
"There's a price to pay for greatness

56:06.440 --> 56:09.466
but the great seldom pay it themselves."

56:10.840 --> 56:14.140
- How are you bearing up?
- I wish people would stop asking me that.

56:14.240 --> 56:18.980
Are you hungry? Mrs Lacey's summer pudding
has been shamefully neglected.

56:19.080 --> 56:24.302
I think it was Napoleon who said that there
are three different kinds of courage.

56:24.600 --> 56:25.340
Did he now?

56:25.440 --> 56:29.342
Yes he did and I'm going to tell you
what he thought was the greatest.

56:29.600 --> 56:33.180
He called it the 3-in-the-morning courage.

56:33.280 --> 56:36.465
When everything is dark and cold

56:36.600 --> 56:39.068
and all seems lost.

56:40.200 --> 56:45.069
Winston says Napoleon taught him the
dangers of fighting on more than one front.

56:47.240 --> 56:49.549
A lesson I don't seem to have learned.

56:50.560 --> 56:52.391
You know what he says?

56:52.600 --> 56:53.828
KBO.

56:54.600 --> 56:57.500
"Keep Buggering On".
His answer to everything.

56:57.600 --> 57:00.500
- What else is there?
- Does it never occur to you

57:00.600 --> 57:04.700
that there ought to be something other
than buggering on?

57:04.800 --> 57:07.348
None of us would be here without him.

57:08.000 --> 57:11.887
- And he wouldn't be here without you.
- He'd be here whatever.

57:11.987 --> 57:15.826
No, trust me,
he's only flesh and a little bone.

57:16.480 --> 57:19.984
You're his rock, he knows that.

57:20.920 --> 57:22.421
He always has.

57:30.760 --> 57:32.227
"He stood

57:32.600 --> 57:36.946
and heard the steeples
sprinkle the quarters on the morning town.

57:37.760 --> 57:40.180
One, two, three, four

57:40.280 --> 57:44.227
to marketplace and people,
it tossed them down.

57:44.840 --> 57:45.820
Strapped..."

57:45.920 --> 57:49.503
"Noosed, nighing his hour

57:49.800 --> 57:54.021
he stood and counted them, cursed his luck

57:54.200 --> 57:57.271
and then the clock collected in the tower

57:57.520 --> 57:59.863
its strength, and struck."

58:03.160 --> 58:04.946
Brain still works.

58:05.440 --> 58:09.183
I learnt it at school,
but I'm not sure I could do that now.

58:21.000 --> 58:25.061
The box on the desk, my cigars.

58:26.400 --> 58:28.231
I'm not gonna do that.

58:28.400 --> 58:29.980
I don't want a debate.

58:30.080 --> 58:31.980
Good, cos you're not gonna get one.

58:32.080 --> 58:34.548
Get Colville, would you.

58:34.680 --> 58:36.060
Not if you're gonna ask him for a cigar.

58:36.160 --> 58:39.580
Get my secretary. I'm the Prime Minister.

58:39.680 --> 58:42.660
I need to know what's happened.

58:49.320 --> 58:51.060
- Mr Colville.
- Yes.

58:51.160 --> 58:54.664
The Prime Minister is awake,
he wants to speak to you.

58:56.400 --> 58:57.708
Oh.

58:58.280 --> 58:59.542
Thank you.

59:04.560 --> 59:06.180
Prime Minister.

59:06.280 --> 59:09.260
- How are you feeling?
- Get me a cigar, would you?

59:10.880 --> 59:12.506
Of course, sir.

59:17.160 --> 59:19.300
It's very good to see you awake, sir.

59:19.400 --> 59:20.901
Indeed.

59:28.440 --> 59:33.662
Have you, have you rescheduled Bermuda?

59:34.320 --> 59:36.663
- November.
- Ah, good.

59:37.080 --> 59:38.866
Mmm.

59:39.520 --> 59:42.140
But that's after Margate, sir.

59:42.240 --> 59:44.265
Good, that's good.

59:44.400 --> 59:47.301
We need to start work on the speech.

59:47.640 --> 59:50.507
- Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure.

59:50.840 --> 59:53.866
- Get me a whiskey, will you?
- Yes, Prime Minister.

59:56.640 --> 59:59.740
Ah, Millie, pass me the ashtray would you?

59:59.840 --> 01:00:03.100
He's not seriously thinking
of going to party conference?

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.907
According to Jock, he's already
drafting the speech for it.

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:10.831
If he is well enough to attend,
it'll be a good time for him to step aside.

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:14.460
How is Anthony? Is he fit to take over?

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:16.020
He's building up his strength.

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:17.580
He very much wants to.

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.900
- And there's been nothing in the press?
- Not a peep.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.391
As far as the public is concerned,
Winston is taking a well-earned rest.

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:28.020
Mary, can the children
come up from the farm today?

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:29.507
Of course, Mama.

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:34.187
I want Chartwell to feel like
a family home again.

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:39.345
Somewhere to catch him when he realises
he won't be going back to Downing Street.

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:44.827
What I care about now is peace above all.

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:47.185
A time of peace.

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:53.340
"What I care about now is peace above all,
a time of peace."

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:57.069
- Do we have to do this again?
- Yes, we do.

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:04.311
I've lived a life like a man
who has pursued peace.

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:07.380
- Have you got that?
- Yes, you're a man who's pursued peace.

01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:10.028
Like a ferret does a rabbit.

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:16.780
You're looking at me
as if that's not very good.

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:18.347
Well, it's not.

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:28.669
Mrs J Arthur Rank, please.

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:30.791
Yes, it's Mrs Christopher Soames.

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:34.620
Arthur! Hello, yes, it's Mary Soames.

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:37.180
Arthur, my parents were wondering,
would it be possible for you

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:39.942
to send a film down to Chartwell,
like you used to?

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.100
That Hamilton Woman?

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:43.940
No, we've seen that
with him a thousand times.

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:46.190
Do you have anything more recent, Arthur?

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:50.821
"My lords, ladies and gentlemen

01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:55.587
I am sure you will be relieved

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:58.660
by the news from British Guiana."

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.340
I can't hear you.

01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:01.420
What?

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:03.700
The Tory party are
a bunch of deaf old folk.

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:06.580
If I can't hear you,
they haven't got a chance.

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:08.100
- I'm sure...
- What?

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:09.826
I'm sure!

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:11.627
Oh, bugger!

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:13.900
Lost my place now.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.501
Where was I?

01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:17.507
Just start again.

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:21.106
"My lords, ladies and gentlemen..."

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:30.620
I can't squeeze it, I can't!

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:32.900
Why can't I use my right hand?

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.100
Don't shout at me.

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:36.220
I'll shout if I bloody well want to!

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:39.420
If you rely on your right side
to walk and pick things up

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:42.020
then your left side will never recover.

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:44.260
You'll walk like a listing ship.

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:46.140
"A lisping shit"?

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:49.340
A listing ship! Wash your ears out
and your mouth, too.

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:53.342
- Are you this nasty at St. Mary's?
- Yes, I am.

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.020
That was good.

01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:02.300
Imagined it was you I was hurling.

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:07.220
I tried to imagine it was Herman Goering,
but that didn't make me angry enough.

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:09.185
Well, it was your best yet.

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:24.262
Millie...

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:30.140
You must be careful about
pushing Sir Winston too fast.

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:32.980
Oh, it's not me pushing, ma'am, it's him.

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:36.780
He wakes up every morning with a plan,
he calls it "action this day".

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.780
Yes, he would.

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:42.429
He's a remarkable man, Lady Churchill.
That's why he's making progress.

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:49.143
He is brave, yes, but this is
not a cavalry charge or a desert.

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:52.944
This is age itself he's up against.

01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:56.901
He needs hope.

01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:59.266
I've seen it before.

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:01.950
Hope is what makes the difference.

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:06.667
Millie...

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.141
my husband's ambition runs people over

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.380
and it comes at a cost.

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:18.028
Often to those closest to him.

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:22.780
If he fails and gets low, as only he can

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:26.907
it will not be you who has to pick him up.

01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:30.506
You'll be in Australia
with your young man.

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:34.582
Yes, ma'am.

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:41.620
- He must be missing you.
- Oh, John?

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:44.660
No, he's happy, he's on his way.

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:46.180
And when do you follow?

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:50.182
In a month. Although I won't go,
not if Sir Winston needs me.

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:53.304
You must be excited.

01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:58.300
Well, it's John that's pushed it, really.
He says it's full of opportunity.

01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:01.380
Well, there is opportunity there.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.387
For him.

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:07.620
But I like my job.

01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:09.940
I'm proud of the NHS and...

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:13.862
not sure I want to be stuck on the other
side of the world, being just a wife.

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:18.425
I'm sorry, it's...

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:21.311
It's hard to explain.

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:25.263
But the closer it gets to going,
the more I think...

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:29.664
I don't know why
I'm putting his dreams before mine.

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:16.623
You can get that bloody thing
out of here right now!

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.869
I could always carry you.

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:30.511
Grandpapa, grandpapa, grandpapa!

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:46.870
Well done, well done, sir!

01:06:56.320 --> 01:07:01.660
Winston, Nicholas and Emma
have been making biscuits all afternoon.

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:03.591
How delicious!

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.260
Did you make them yourself?

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:06.861
Yes.

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:11.300
- Who put all the sugar in?
- I did.

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:13.660
You did? Good man.

01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:16.260
- And who cracked the eggs?
- Me.

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:17.460
Wow!

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:20.984
Mrs Lacey, you're out of a job.

01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:24.622
Come on, if you could all take your seats.

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:27.620
- Oh, God.
- Let me help.

01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:29.860
I hope we're not watching
Wuthering Heights.

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:31.109
No.

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:33.749
Alright everyone, lights out.

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:37.821
Where's Millie?

01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:40.748
Jock, can you see where she is?

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:43.780
What's this one about, then?

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:46.300
It's about an old clock
which keeps breaking down.

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:47.740
Is it called Winston?

01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:52.180
Miss Appleyard.

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:54.260
The Prime Minister's asking
for you downstairs.

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:55.460
Is something wrong?

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:57.983
No, he wants you to watch the film
with the family.

01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:01.944
You can stop working for a moment.

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:04.585
You're one to talk.

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:16.782
- Oh...
- Sorry, darling.

01:08:17.319 --> 01:08:19.390
Is it really serious?

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:30.426
Do you think you can fix it?

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:33.740
I don't know, I can try. It'll take hours.

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:36.308
Ambrose, Ambrose wait a minute!

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:03.625
Good night, Lady Churchill.

01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:42.067
Oh, God...

01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:44.582
What happened?

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:47.140
I need to go to London!

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:50.460
Sir, please, sir, you need
to go back to bed now!

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:57.420
...don't do yourself! I need to go to London,
I need to go, I need to see, to see it...

01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:59.221
Just let me help you.

01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:09.070
Was I, was I talking rubbish then?

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:10.907
A bit.

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:17.310
There is no need to tell my wife.

01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:22.581
Nor that defeatist quack of mine.

01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:31.021
Growing old is not for cowards.

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:35.340
It's certainly not.

01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:40.585
Such a strange thing to happen
to a little boy.

01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:49.948
Have you nursed many people
at the end, Minnie?

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:53.622
Yes, I have.

01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:59.068
What scares me is
getting to the end before I finish.

01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:05.100
L'Attaque. What's that one?

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:06.100
That's my colonel.

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:08.460
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is, I've got two

01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:10.824
and it beats your captain.

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:13.500
Just keep it still.

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:14.908
L'Attaque.

01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:17.900
It's a bomb, so bye bye.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.660
What's next, Jock?

01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:21.900
Next is a report on
the safety of helicopters.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.780
Not safe, that's obvious.

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:25.900
- That's what the report's addressing.
- Hmm.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.740
- Use your left.
- No.

01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:29.020
L'Attaque.

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:30.860
- That's just a scout.
- Better, Winston.

01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:32.666
Bye bye.

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:37.940
I will leave a precis of the report
in the box overnight.

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:39.621
Thank you, Jock.

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:43.620
There's no point in rushing succession
with Eden ill.

01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:47.780
If that's the case, then you'll have
no choice but to continue.

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:49.460
Quite right.

01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:52.540
Circumstances may well convince me

01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:55.541
of my indispensability.

01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:57.780
L'Attaque!

01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:00.701
That's a bomb, bye bye.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.343
- Morning, Rab.
- Jock.

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:07.380
How was Greece? I see you got a tan.

01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:10.301
It's difficult being in Eden's company
and not getting a tan.

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:14.026
- When's he due back in England?
- A week or so.

01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:17.660
- Ooh!
- Ah!

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:20.831
Outmanoeuvred by a 5-year-old!

01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:29.460
- No, use your left hand.
- Use your left.

01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:30.902
Left hand, Papa.

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:40.780
That was a silly shot, grandpa.

01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:41.820
Be quiet.

01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:43.980
Will Winston be well enough for Margate?

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:46.105
The party wants a public coronation.

01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:48.420
"The King is dead, long live the King",
you know, that sort of thing.

01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:51.421
But he's not dead,
he's making good progress.

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.580
Some days he's stronger
than others, of course.

01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:56.911
He doesn't have to dance and sing,
just pass on the crown.

01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:00.950
And there's his pride, Rab, he doesn't
want to be seen in a wheelchair.

01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:03.900
Foul ball, Nicholas, take the shot again.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.501
That's not fair!

01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:09.980
Ah, here's the real enemy, Nicholas.

01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:12.787
I hope you don't think of me
as an enemy, Prime Minister.

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:17.350
I don't think of you at all, Rab.

01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:20.940
How's my Foreign Secretary?

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.260
- Fighting fit.
- Jolly good.

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:29.420
I expect you were disappointed
not to find me ranting in a storm

01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:32.387
like King Lear with a lisp.

01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:35.460
All I wish is that your health
improves quickly, Prime Minister.

01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:37.391
I wish that too.

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:38.900
Pick up the ball, Nicholas.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.867
Nicholas, why don't you let grandpa do it?

01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:43.588
What?

01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:46.110
Oh, alright...

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:52.220
- Prime Minister...
- No, no, no, no, please!

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:54.390
Just let him try.

01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:57.108
Get his stick.

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:01.820
Back.

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:03.262
Now...

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:20.302
Look at that, lovely.

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:25.785
Emma's turn now.

01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:28.027
Very sad.

01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:33.460
I want you to stop this pretence
that you can go on forever.

01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:35.900
I have one more task, Clemmy.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.180
Oh, Winston!

01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:40.060
There's always one more thing.

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:44.780
I can try to make those terrible bombs
obsolete before I die.

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:49.066
Everyone else has gone,
I'm the only one left.

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:52.340
Can't my last victory be one of peace?

01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:54.820
It's time to stop.

01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:58.420
- My darling Clemmy...
- Don't "darling" me.

01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:01.260
I want time with you
while you're still you.

01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:02.740
While I'm still me.

01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:05.460
The children need time with you.

01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:08.060
They're not children anymore.

01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:10.503
They are desperate for you.

01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:15.900
I begged you to retire after the war.
You only stopped because they voted you out.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.540
The people didn't understand.

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:22.900
The people were exhausted!
So was I, and I am now.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.661
Clemmy...

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:45.261
Clemmy...

01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:52.470
You asked me once
who was in the photograph by his bed.

01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:54.507
The little girl.

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:05.065
Her name was Marigold.

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:10.510
It's Marigold's song he's been singing.

01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:18.067
Diana taught her the words
and she was so proud of remembering them.

01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:25.509
She died just before her third birthday.

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:29.789
She'd had a cold all summer.

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:34.502
What child doesn't have
a summer cold, Millie?

01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:36.502
But...

01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:41.223
it wasn't cold, it was septicaemia.

01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:45.590
And I wasn't there.

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:49.744
They were at the seaside
with their governess.

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:53.543
By the time we got to her...

01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:58.550
It was too late to do anything.

01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:06.987
Winston and I sat
with her for... two days.

01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:11.265
Neither of us slept.

01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:18.344
We sang nursery rhymes with her
and told her stories.

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:21.661
He'd never had the time
to tell her stories before.

01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:26.380
At the end...

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:31.510
she asked me to sing that song.

01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:34.262
And I did.

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:38.106
But she stopped me.

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:43.542
She was tired, she said.

01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:49.790
Then... she asked me
to finish it in the morning.

01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:02.345
But that was it.

01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:12.470
Her last breath is in that song.

01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:21.701
We never talk about it.

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:29.064
We never talk about her.

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:27.181
Do you like Henley?

01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:34.270
He was Stephenson's model
for Long John Silver.

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:37.662
- I bet you didn't know that.
- I did.

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:40.902
He was my father's favourite poet.

01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:43.426
What does your father do?

01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:46.063
He was a shop steward at the pits.

01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:51.588
And he was no fan of yours, not since
you sent the army in on the Welsh miners.

01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:56.146
Well, at least he's got
good taste in poets.

01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:58.905
This one's his favourite.

01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:03.910
He wrote it just before
having his leg cut off.

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:07.943
It's about hope.

01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:12.388
"Out of the night that covers me"

01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:17.263
"black as a pit from pole to pole"

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:20.307
"I thank whatever Gods may be"

01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:23.830
"for my unconquerable soul."

01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:31.830
Millie... I need some hope.

01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:36.628
Good, that's good, well done.

01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:40.300
And another, not too fast, you're fine.

01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:43.062
Just keep your weight on me.

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:45.981
There you go.

01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:49.741
Winston?

01:21:57.600 --> 01:21:58.828
Good.

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:05.667
Good.

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:11.790
I'm going to take my hands away now.

01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:32.380
Dickens used to walk from his home in Kent
to London almost every week.

01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:34.460
- Did you know that?
- No.

01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:37.062
I did, my dad told me that.

01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:42.420
Her father's a sort
of literary trade unionist.

01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:44.749
- If such a thing is possi... oh!
- Oh!

01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:47.060
Are you alright?

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:49.220
Yes, I am.

01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:51.663
- Does it hurt?
- No.

01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:54.231
- Let's try slowly.
- Alright.

01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:56.464
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

01:22:57.880 --> 01:23:00.064
Here, lean on the stick, that's right.

01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:03.221
Okay, one, two, three, and...

01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:07.311
- Let's get the wheelchair.
- No wheelchair!

01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:13.910
I'm not being carried into the party
conference looking like a bloody maharajah.

01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:18.660
What was Winston's mood like
when you were last with him?

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:21.308
Winstonian, as you would expect.

01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:23.620
But physically,
he knows he can't carry on.

01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:26.980
I mean, he can barely get out of his
wheelchair and pick up a croquet ball.

01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:28.860
I think he'll be relieved.

01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:30.980
You'll have to be firm with him.

01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:32.627
Of course.

01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:35.702
We've waited long enough, Anthony.

01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:38.268
Here you go.

01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:40.060
Jock, bring me an unfinished canvas.

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:42.980
I want Anthony to think
I've been doing this all afternoon.

01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:45.220
Where shall I hide the wheelchair?

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:47.260
Put it right here, next to me.

01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:49.220
Get rid of that chair.

01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:51.231
Thank you.

01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:55.380
I didn't know you painted so much.

01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:58.142
My great distraction, Millie.

01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:02.780
Did you know that Turner
painted better the worse his eyes got?

01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:05.109
So there's hope for you yet.

01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:07.700
They're here.

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:09.347
Good luck.

01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:14.980
- Rab.
- Jock.

01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:16.581
Hello, Anthony.

01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:18.543
After you.

01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:30.060
Good afternoon, Prime Minister.

01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:31.940
Anthony, my boy

01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:36.590
thank you for driving down, come take a seat.
Make yourself comfortable.

01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:38.426
Come on.

01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:42.620
It lifts my heart to see you
out and about again, Anthony.

01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:44.949
Thank you, Winston.

01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:47.540
We were very concerned.

01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:50.020
Well, we were concerned about you

01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:54.140
and it's encouraging to see you
not confined to bed anymore.

01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:57.107
July and August
can't have been easy for you.

01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:02.660
I did not enjoy July, but in August,
I believe we beat the Australians.

01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:04.780
By eight wickets, I hear.

01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:09.590
For the first time in years,
the Ashes will remain at home.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.467
Like you?

01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:16.260
- We should talk about Margate.
- Well, yes, of course.

01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:22.663
Now, I'll understand if, due to your
grave illness, you wish to step down.

01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:26.820
Margate might be a good time
to make the announcement.

01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:29.700
If that's what you're thinking of doing.

01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:31.540
Winston, that's not
what I was thinking of doing.

01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:35.064
Oh, well, as you were then,
Anthony, you and I.

01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:40.420
PM and Foreign Secretary, the best team.

01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:43.660
So in other words, Winston,
you got me all the way down to Kent

01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:46.100
to tell me you wish to continue?

01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:48.828
Beautiful countryside, isn't it?

01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:51.180
He has no intention of resigning at all.

01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:54.380
He even asked if I was going to resign
at Margate because of my own health.

01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:56.620
Did he stand while you were with him?

01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:58.540
- No.
- Well, then.

01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:02.064
What Winston intends to do
is no longer important.

01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:33.622
I thought Anthony
was looking well, if a bit thin.

01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:40.983
Clemmy, if I'm wrong
and I can't get through Margate

01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:43.545
then I'm all yours.

01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:46.224
That's my promise.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:51.886
If I fall, there's nowhere I want to fall

01:26:51.986 --> 01:26:54.989
except in your arms.

01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:58.660
You've made promises
to me before, darling.

01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:01.547
I... I know, but...

01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:03.705
And broken them.

01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:06.906
But not anymore.

01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:14.345
Margate, then.

01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:33.380
Jock, are all three suitcases in the car?

01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:37.871
Yes they are. We need to get going,
Lady Churchill, it's two hours to Margate.

01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:41.748
Come in.

01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:52.029
Sir, did you climb the stairs?

01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:54.660
Don't fuss.

01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:58.662
I know, I know it's part of being a nurse.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.583
Tell me, when are you sailing?

01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:14.140
Er, on Friday. I've got two days
in Yorkshire with my mum and dad.

01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:17.391
Oh, yes, take a brolly.

01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:27.349
I couldn't have got through this
without you, Millie.

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:34.105
I've written in it.

01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:40.302
"I thank whatever Gods may be

01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:44.306
for your unconquerable soul."

01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:49.941
Thank you.

01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:52.991
I will treasure it.

01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:04.666
Well, I hope this very gloomy looking
young man knows how to treasure you.

01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:08.022
He does.

01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:14.227
I hope so.

01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:18.780
Thank you, Mrs Lacey.

01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:23.420
I say with great pleasure that I hope
not to see you again in a long time.

01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:27.420
Come on! I don't know why
you're saying such grand farewells.

01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:29.909
You could be back here next week!

01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:58.500
- Do you like the slogan?
- Is it one of yours?

01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:00.940
He suggested "Keep Buggering On",
Lady Churchill

01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:03.020
but I toned it down when I passed it on.

01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:07.820
Rab suggests you might deliver your speech
sitting on a high stool.

01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:13.142
I'm addressing the Tory party, not singing
"White Christmas" in a cocktail bar!

01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:15.182
Onward!

01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:38.222
Last month, we did not have
quite so big a surplus in our balance...

01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:43.749
but in fact, things were a little better
than I had anticipated.

01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:46.299
Because this is the time of year

01:30:46.399 --> 01:30:50.383
when we purchase our main products
on the dollar market.

01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:55.300
Tobacco, which might be
of some interest to some of you.

01:30:57.200 --> 01:31:00.988
It's certainly of interest
to me, the exchequer.

01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:47.740
And there is conversation
therefore, between...

01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:50.627
- Where will you be sitting?
- Close.

01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:52.901
Thank you.

01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:56.540
Come on everyone, off you go.

01:31:56.640 --> 01:31:58.301
Good luck, Papa.

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:00.347
Thank you.

01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:02.860
Good luck, Winston.

01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:05.827
Oh, switch that off, will you?

01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:20.743
I told them to put some flowers in here
to brighten it up a bit.

01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:23.866
Asked for these especially.

01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:27.227
Marigolds.

01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:30.903
Yes.

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:40.587
I love you.

01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:50.750
Face them down, Winston.

01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:55.389
I can face anything with you.

01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:58.148
The Tories, Russians

01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:00.870
even death itself.

01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:06.822
Come on.

01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:19.260
Working together,
achieving these new settlements

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:22.067
for public finances,
for our financial services

01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:25.220
and for fairness in Europe
will help us secure...

01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:26.540
- How are you feeling?
- Good, good.

01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:28.187
...for us all.

01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:33.620
I thought I might just
sum up what I feel...

01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:38.191
No-one expects a long speech, if you feel you
can't get through it, just cut to the end.

01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:42.620
...and I look forward over
the coming years to working with you

01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:43.940
to make that happen.

01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:47.860
Do you mind?

01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:49.461
Of course.

01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:55.540
And so I have great pleasure
in welcoming to conference

01:33:55.640 --> 01:33:59.980
the Prime Minister, and leader
of the Conservative and Unionist Party

01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:01.700
Sir Winston Churchill.

01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:39.866
My lords, ladies and gentlemen...

01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:02.784
had the United States
taken before the First World War,

01:35:02.884 --> 01:35:05.340
or between the wars

01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:11.504
the same interest
and made the same sacrifices

01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:15.949
then there might never have
been a first war

01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:21.431
and there would certainly
never have been a second.

01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:23.688
With her mighty aid,

01:35:23.788 --> 01:35:29.180
I have a sure hope,
there will not be a third.

01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:37.900
I'm sure you would be
relieved by the new...

01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:41.702
By the...

01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:47.391
By the news from British Guiana.

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:14.860
I don't often do that.

01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:18.429
Well, not at conference anyway.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:42.061
One word personally about myself.

01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:49.667
If I stay on for the time being,
bearing the burden at my age

01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:54.780
it is not because of
love of power or office.

01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:57.860
I've had an ample share of both.

01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:01.214
If I stay, it is because

01:37:01.314 --> 01:37:05.013
I have a feeling that I may,

01:37:05.113 --> 01:37:07.340
through things that have happened

01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:12.150
have an influence on
what I care about above all else

01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:19.660
the building of a sure and lasting peace.

01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:53.780
Let us then go forward together

01:37:53.880 --> 01:38:00.740
with courage and composure,
with resolution and good faith

01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:04.506
to the end which all desire.
