WEBVTT

00:00.710 --> 00:03.170
Previously on Mom...
How you doing over there?

00:03.170 --> 00:04.960
I'm good. Really good.

00:04.960 --> 00:06.340
You have a lot to be proud of.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.630
Damn right.
Georgetown Law School

00:08.630 --> 00:10.510
on a full scholarship.

00:10.510 --> 00:12.090
Phew.

00:12.090 --> 00:14.090
Every mom dreams of the day
when they drop

00:14.090 --> 00:17.640
their 42-year-old daughter off
at the airport to go to school.

00:17.640 --> 00:19.640
Why are you being
such a grouchy, grumpy,

00:19.640 --> 00:22.020
grocery-store-cake-buying
sourpuss?

00:22.020 --> 00:24.150
My doctor told me

00:24.150 --> 00:26.560
that I have something wrong
with my heart.

00:29.570 --> 00:31.320
You got plans for Saturday?

00:31.320 --> 00:32.950
I'm gonna get my tires rotated.

00:32.950 --> 00:35.660
Yeah, you are.

00:35.660 --> 00:37.620
You can make anything dirty.

00:37.620 --> 00:40.250
Yeah, I can.

00:40.250 --> 00:43.410
I'm also gonna devote
part of my day to mocking you

00:43.410 --> 00:45.630
for forgetting
our wedding anniversary.

00:45.630 --> 00:48.420
Oh, my God, it's Saturday?

00:48.420 --> 00:50.090
We made it to a year.

00:50.090 --> 00:51.800
Damn it! I owe Wendy
a hundred bucks.

00:51.800 --> 00:53.380
You bet against us?

00:53.380 --> 00:55.260
Yeah, 'cause I figured
if we got divorced,

00:55.260 --> 00:57.890
at least I'd have a hundred
bucks to jump-start my new life.

00:58.890 --> 01:00.270
Are we gonna do gifts?

01:00.270 --> 01:02.180
We...
Let me tell you why we're not.

01:02.180 --> 01:03.850
This one sets the bar,
then every year

01:03.850 --> 01:05.100
it's got to be a little better,
and eventually

01:05.100 --> 01:06.690
it just spins out of control.

01:06.690 --> 01:08.980
Did you know
that on the 50th anniversary,

01:08.980 --> 01:11.230
people give
each other actual gold?

01:11.230 --> 01:14.030
I don't need to be shopping
for gold at 110.

01:14.030 --> 01:15.530
But let's at least do a card.

01:15.530 --> 01:17.320
Really? A card?

01:17.320 --> 01:20.120
Yeah, well, i-if we don't
do that, we're just roommates.

01:20.120 --> 01:22.700
No, we're not.
We're gonna have sex.

01:23.710 --> 01:25.500
That's true. Sex is our card.

01:26.500 --> 01:28.710
And you can lick the envelope.

01:28.710 --> 01:30.920
Where are you going?
Nowhere, I just felt like

01:30.920 --> 01:34.220
you should be watching
my ass as I said that.

01:34.220 --> 01:36.130
Where's your wallet?
I need a hundred bucks.

01:39.260 --> 01:42.310
Marjorie, alcoholic.
ALL: Hi, Marjorie.

01:42.310 --> 01:45.140
As you know, I just had
a stent put into my heart

01:45.140 --> 01:48.520
and I'm feeling pretty great,
but it got me thinking

01:48.520 --> 01:51.980
that I need to put
more carpe into my diem.

01:51.980 --> 01:53.990
So...

01:53.990 --> 01:57.450
I invited my friend Gary
to come visit.

01:58.450 --> 01:59.990
We bumped into each other

01:59.990 --> 02:03.040
at a sober convention in Chicago
a few months ago

02:03.040 --> 02:05.290
and we've been
texting ever since.

02:05.290 --> 02:07.120
What happened to Wayne?

02:07.120 --> 02:08.540
He's still in the picture.

02:08.540 --> 02:11.500
It's like an episode
of Riverdale.

02:11.500 --> 02:15.840
Normally I take things
very slow, but why?

02:15.840 --> 02:19.220
I like him, he likes me,
I have new moles every week,

02:19.220 --> 02:21.390
let's light this candle.

02:21.390 --> 02:23.010
Thanks.

02:23.010 --> 02:25.480
Are moles really
that dangerous?

02:25.480 --> 02:27.850
Oh, yeah, they should
just call them cancer dots.

02:27.850 --> 02:31.020
Bonnie, alcoholic.
ALL: Hi, Bonnie.

02:31.020 --> 02:32.820
If you're wondering
if this program works,

02:32.820 --> 02:35.650
I just want to say I have been
married for a whole year.

02:35.650 --> 02:38.610
Oh, my God,
I won a hundred bucks.

02:38.610 --> 02:41.410
Oh, my God, I'm covered
in cancer dots.

02:42.870 --> 02:44.910
♪ ♪

02:54.670 --> 02:56.340
I hate it when we sit
at the tables.

02:56.340 --> 02:57.670
The chairs are
all wibbly-wobbly.

02:57.670 --> 02:59.260
(wood creaking)

02:59.260 --> 03:01.760
We need the extra room.
Marjorie's bringing Gary.

03:01.760 --> 03:05.310
She's so excited, I had to give
my opinion on three nightgowns.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.810
There's three kinds of flannel?

03:06.810 --> 03:08.270
Only one was flannel.

03:08.270 --> 03:10.060
One was, I think, burlap.
(Jill laughs)

03:10.060 --> 03:14.400
And there was a racy one
with a neckline down to here.

03:14.400 --> 03:16.190
(laughter)

03:16.190 --> 03:18.440
Hi, ladies.
ALL: Hey.

03:18.440 --> 03:20.110
This is Gary.

03:20.110 --> 03:21.610
Hi, Gary.
Hi, Gary.

03:21.610 --> 03:23.870
MARJORIE: Wendy, Bonnie,
Tammy and Jill.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.370
Hi. Great to put some faces
with the names.

03:26.370 --> 03:27.580
How was your flight?

03:28.580 --> 03:29.830
Pilot was flying a little low

03:29.830 --> 03:31.830
for my taste, but I'm here.

03:31.830 --> 03:34.790
(laughs)
Oh, Gary.

03:34.790 --> 03:36.630
That was, that was funny?

03:36.630 --> 03:38.880
Maybe he's doing something
to her under the table.

03:40.420 --> 03:41.840
So, Tammy,
you're the handyman, right?

03:41.840 --> 03:43.260
How's that going?

03:43.260 --> 03:44.720
Going great.
I'm actually about to buy

03:44.720 --> 03:46.010
my first truck.

03:46.010 --> 03:49.390
Really? In this economy?

03:49.390 --> 03:52.390
If it were me, I'd
give it six months.

03:52.390 --> 03:53.940
Hmm. Thanks, Gary.

03:53.940 --> 03:55.730
I mean, you know,
you get in too deep,

03:55.730 --> 03:58.730
and before you know it,
you're living in that truck.

03:59.730 --> 04:01.900
I said, "Thanks, Gary."

04:01.900 --> 04:04.410
Ooh, you're the one with the
phone permanently attached.

04:05.950 --> 04:08.950
Oh, I don't mean to be rude,
I'm just making a quick donation

04:08.950 --> 04:11.160
to a charity
for underprivileged girls.

04:11.160 --> 04:14.080
They had an ad on Instagram
that got me right in the feels.

04:14.080 --> 04:16.790
If it were me,
I wouldn't go online.

04:16.790 --> 04:19.670
Yeah, it's too risky.
Just write a check.

04:19.670 --> 04:20.880
If there's one thing
I'm good at,

04:20.880 --> 04:22.670
it's spending money online.

04:22.670 --> 04:24.550
No, I'm not a robot.

04:24.550 --> 04:26.260
Traffic light,
traffic light, traffic light.

04:28.180 --> 04:31.020
Why are you wearing a sweater?

04:31.020 --> 04:33.730
News flash,
you live in California.

04:33.730 --> 04:34.980
(laughs)

04:35.980 --> 04:37.730
I'm chilly.

04:37.730 --> 04:40.150
Gary, have you ever thought
of being a life coach?

04:40.150 --> 04:41.610
Nah, I don't like
sticking my nose

04:41.610 --> 04:43.490
in other people's business.

04:45.280 --> 04:46.660
You ready to order?

04:46.660 --> 04:48.700
Yes, I'll have
a grilled cheese.

04:48.700 --> 04:50.330
With your bum ticker?

04:50.330 --> 04:52.700
If it was me,
I'd get the Greek salad.

04:52.700 --> 04:55.620
(laughs):
Oh, Gary.

04:55.620 --> 04:57.500
Greek salad.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.590
It's sweet the way
you look out for me.

04:59.590 --> 05:01.210
(phone chimes)

05:01.210 --> 05:03.050
Oh, my God.
What?

05:03.050 --> 05:06.130
$50,000? I only meant
to donate $500.

05:06.130 --> 05:09.510
Wouldn't have happened
with a check. Patty melt?

05:12.810 --> 05:15.190
Hey, Bobbi, Jill Kendall
is here to say hello.

05:16.190 --> 05:17.440
Oh, my goodness.

05:17.440 --> 05:20.190
It is such a pleasure
to meet you.

05:20.190 --> 05:22.030
You're my hero.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.490
Oh!
(laughs)
Please, sit down.

05:24.490 --> 05:26.780
Uh, sorry I didn't
make an appointment.

05:26.780 --> 05:28.870
Oh, are you kidding?
You gave $50,000.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.490
You can come at 2:00
in the morning if you want.

05:30.490 --> 05:31.870
About that...

05:31.870 --> 05:33.660
You have no idea
how much your money

05:33.660 --> 05:35.460
is gonna help these girls.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.120
This is the largest donation
the Inspired Girl Project

05:38.120 --> 05:39.920
has ever received.

05:39.920 --> 05:43.340
About that, um, I made
a little, tiny boo-boo error.

05:43.340 --> 05:47.590
Um, I meant to donate $500,
but I forgot the decimal point.

05:47.590 --> 05:49.220
Silly me.

05:49.220 --> 05:52.970
Um, so, if you could just
shoot me back $49,500,

05:52.970 --> 05:55.140
I would be so appreciative.

05:55.140 --> 05:57.100
You're asking
for your money back?

05:57.100 --> 05:58.940
No, not the money
I intended to give,

05:58.940 --> 06:01.650
just the money I did
not intend to give.

06:01.650 --> 06:03.780
Um, the $500 is all yours.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.820
Don't spend it all in one place.

06:05.820 --> 06:06.950
(laughs)

06:06.950 --> 06:09.530
Or do. This place.

06:09.530 --> 06:11.530
Okay.

06:11.530 --> 06:14.450
$500 is very generous

06:14.450 --> 06:16.370
and we can do
a lot with it.

06:16.370 --> 06:18.580
Sorry to interrupt,
but the girls would like

06:18.580 --> 06:20.500
to perform a song to thank
Miss Kendall for her donation.

06:20.500 --> 06:22.420
No song.
Yeah, no song.

06:24.420 --> 06:26.260
(TV playing indistinctly)

06:26.260 --> 06:28.220
What do you think
they're gonna do, Bonnie?

06:28.220 --> 06:30.640
Think they're gonna love it or
think they're gonna list it?

06:32.260 --> 06:34.220
If it was me, I'd list it.

06:34.220 --> 06:35.970
Oh, my God. "If it was me."

06:35.970 --> 06:37.600
I'm turning into Gary.

06:38.600 --> 06:40.020
Stop pretending
to be asleep.

06:40.020 --> 06:41.860
Well, then, go home.

06:41.860 --> 06:44.440
No. Home is where
the Gary is.

06:44.440 --> 06:46.280
Oh, he's not that bad.

06:46.280 --> 06:48.950
You've had one lunch with him.
I've had three days.

06:48.950 --> 06:50.950
Did you know
I open my mail wrong?

06:50.950 --> 06:52.370
"You're supposed to do it
on the end so you don't

06:52.370 --> 06:54.620
accidentally rip a check."

06:54.620 --> 06:55.990
That's not bad advice.

06:55.990 --> 06:57.620
Yeah, but I didn't say to him,

06:57.620 --> 06:59.910
"Hey, Gary, any thoughts
on how I open my mail?"

06:59.910 --> 07:02.000
I'm telling you, you wouldn't
last five minutes with the guy.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.840
Challenge accepted. Adam and I
are having dinner with them

07:03.840 --> 07:04.840
on Saturday.

07:04.840 --> 07:06.590
Oh, God, why?

07:06.590 --> 07:08.800
Because she's my friend,
and she's a million years old

07:08.800 --> 07:10.430
and she found herself
a million-year-old fella

07:10.430 --> 07:11.890
who's into her.

07:11.890 --> 07:13.090
I think that's worthy
of my support.

07:13.090 --> 07:14.930
Well, speaking of support,

07:14.930 --> 07:16.770
Gary's gonna have a few
thoughts on that bra of yours.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.770
Nothing creepy, just
advice about materials.

07:22.650 --> 07:24.520
So are Bonnie and I
just gonna share you

07:24.520 --> 07:27.150
like divorced parents
until Gary leaves?
(laughs softly)

07:27.150 --> 07:29.240
Honestly, the more I try
to be nice to him,

07:29.240 --> 07:31.490
the more I want
to a little bit murder him.

07:31.490 --> 07:33.740
Mm-hmm.
Aw, that girl's adorable.

07:33.740 --> 07:37.160
Is this the charity
you took $49,500 from?

07:37.160 --> 07:40.710
I prefer to see the glass
as $500 full.

07:40.710 --> 07:43.330
I'm just teasing.
500 bucks is a lot.

07:43.330 --> 07:45.000
(gasps) It gets them
two new computers

07:45.000 --> 07:46.420
for their science lab.

07:46.420 --> 07:48.300
And look, a thousand
dollar donation

07:48.300 --> 07:51.220
gets 20 girls
after-school tutoring.

07:51.220 --> 07:53.390
It feels so good to share
with the less fortunate

07:53.390 --> 07:55.260
instead of always thinking
about me, me, me.

07:55.260 --> 07:56.470
(chuckles)

07:56.470 --> 07:57.890
Hey, I didn't get a mug.

07:57.890 --> 08:00.180
$500 is mug level.
Where's my mug?

08:00.180 --> 08:03.810
Oh. "The Inspired Girl
Project provides programs,

08:03.810 --> 08:06.520
"resources and mentors
to at-risk girls

08:06.520 --> 08:08.900
so they can grow into
empowered women."

08:08.900 --> 08:11.610
Fine, I'll let the mug go.

08:11.610 --> 08:14.530
You know, a lot of these girls
are in the foster system.

08:14.530 --> 08:16.700
Man, this would've been
a game changer for me.

08:16.700 --> 08:18.620
Music camp?
(scoffs)

08:18.620 --> 08:20.580
I'd be a professional
flutist by now.

08:20.580 --> 08:22.290
Flautist.

08:22.290 --> 08:24.580
Well, whatever, I'd be
rolling in flautist money.

08:24.580 --> 08:26.920
Then I could make a
donation to this charity

08:26.920 --> 08:29.750
and I'd actually
let them keep it.

08:29.750 --> 08:31.210
(mouths)

08:34.050 --> 08:37.220
Mmm. My fish is delicious.
How's your dinner?

08:37.220 --> 08:40.680
I don't know, I can barely
find it, it's so dark in here.

08:40.680 --> 08:42.140
Oh, there it is.

08:44.020 --> 08:45.600
So, what do you do, Gary?

08:45.600 --> 08:49.190
I was a middle school
vice principal 38 years.

08:49.190 --> 08:52.240
When he retired, they named
a snack bar after him.

08:54.280 --> 08:56.780
What is going on
with your steak?

08:56.780 --> 08:59.580
You ordered medium rare.
It looks like a shingle.

09:00.580 --> 09:01.750
It's fine.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.710
Waiter, waiter.
Gary,

09:03.710 --> 09:05.080
he says it's okay.

09:05.080 --> 09:06.750
Well, I am not letting him
eat that.

09:06.750 --> 09:08.000
Is there a problem?

09:08.000 --> 09:09.500
Well, you tell me.

09:09.500 --> 09:10.960
My friend's steak
here is so overdone

09:10.960 --> 09:12.920
I could play hockey with it.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.840
Gary was a goalie.

09:14.840 --> 09:16.840
I'm sorry, sir.
We'll make another.

09:16.840 --> 09:18.550
It'll only be 20 minutes.

09:18.550 --> 09:20.930
20 minutes for medium rare?

09:20.930 --> 09:24.020
You know, if it
was me, I'd try 12.

09:24.020 --> 09:26.390
So Adam's just gonna
sit here while we eat?

09:26.390 --> 09:29.360
I'm fine.
I'll take another Scotch.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.980
There's so few times
I wish I could join you.

09:30.980 --> 09:32.190
This is one of them.

09:32.190 --> 09:34.440
(laughs)
Happy anniversary.

09:35.450 --> 09:37.160
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What'd you just say?

09:37.160 --> 09:38.360
Anniversary?

09:38.360 --> 09:39.620
Yeah.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.580
I did not realize it was today.

09:41.580 --> 09:43.620
Congratulations.

09:43.620 --> 09:44.950
How long you been married?

09:44.950 --> 09:46.160
One year.

09:46.160 --> 09:47.790
And you're spending it with us?

09:49.540 --> 09:53.090
You know, my first anniversary,
I took my wife to Hawaii.

09:53.090 --> 09:55.510
Breakfast buffet every day.

09:56.510 --> 09:58.220
We didn't want
to make it a thing.

09:58.220 --> 10:00.890
Well, I am making it a thing.

10:00.890 --> 10:03.180
Everybody.

10:03.180 --> 10:04.470
A toast.

10:04.470 --> 10:07.270
Happy anniversary
to Bonnie, and...

10:07.270 --> 10:08.690
what was it?

10:08.690 --> 10:10.770
Adam.
It's hard to remember

10:10.770 --> 10:13.270
'cause it was
the first name ever.

10:18.070 --> 10:19.610
We had a great time!

10:19.610 --> 10:21.160
Let's do it again!

10:21.160 --> 10:22.780
They can still see us,
so if you're gonna

10:22.780 --> 10:24.950
say something negative,
just do it with a smile.

10:24.950 --> 10:28.540
He's my least favorite person
on the planet.

10:28.540 --> 10:30.710
Just had a chance
to run him over.

10:30.710 --> 10:34.500
Didn't take it.
If it was me,
I would have done it.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.880
The nerve of that guy,
telling me white chocolate

10:36.880 --> 10:38.550
isn't real chocolate.

10:38.550 --> 10:40.930
Get off my jock, Willy Wonka.

10:40.930 --> 10:43.470
Bonnie, he told me how
to operate my wheelchair.

10:43.470 --> 10:45.640
(scoffs)
Okay, okay.

10:45.640 --> 10:47.350
Gary is her new boyfriend.

10:47.350 --> 10:48.980
We've got to stop
bad-mouthing him.

10:48.980 --> 10:50.350
You're right.
You're right.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.560
No more. We're done.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.610
(laughing):
Oh, oh, oh.

10:54.610 --> 10:56.530
We didn't talk about what
he said to the valet.

10:56.530 --> 10:59.780
"You should organize your keys
alphabetically by car name."

10:59.780 --> 11:01.820
As if he doesn't know how
to organize keys.

11:01.820 --> 11:04.410
The guy's entire life is keys.

11:04.410 --> 11:07.040
(both laughing)

11:07.040 --> 11:09.830
Ah, I wish Gary was here
so he could tell us

11:09.830 --> 11:11.290
how to do that better.

11:11.290 --> 11:13.670
Why'd you bring him up?

11:13.670 --> 11:16.420
I could have gone again.

11:16.420 --> 11:18.760
I'm gonna say something
to Marjorie.

11:18.760 --> 11:20.680
She deserves more
than that guy.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.140
Please don't do that.
Why not?

11:23.140 --> 11:25.050
She might pick him over you.

11:25.050 --> 11:26.600
I'm not asking her to pick.

11:26.600 --> 11:28.980
She might feel like
she has to.

11:28.980 --> 11:30.850
You don't know what
you're talking about.

11:30.850 --> 11:32.400
(laughs):
Yeah, I do.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.310
It's why I'm not friends
with Mitch anymore.

11:34.310 --> 11:35.980
What?
(sighs)

11:35.980 --> 11:38.320
He is not a big
Bonnie Plunkett fan.

11:38.320 --> 11:40.400
He went off about you
one day, so...

11:40.400 --> 11:42.030
I ended our friendship.

11:42.030 --> 11:45.030
That lying sack of dirt
doesn't like me?

11:45.030 --> 11:47.370
The point is I choose you.

11:47.370 --> 11:49.290
And you tell me this
on our anniversary?

11:49.290 --> 11:51.160
The point is I choose you.

11:51.160 --> 11:52.670
What, exactly,
did he say about me?

11:52.670 --> 11:55.250
The point is I choose you.

11:55.250 --> 11:58.550
What did he say?

11:58.550 --> 12:02.090
He said you're loud,
opinionated and stubborn.

12:02.090 --> 12:05.390
That's fair.

12:10.640 --> 12:12.060
Hey, Jilly-Jill.

12:12.060 --> 12:14.850
Hey, Shawn, what you got
for me today?

12:14.850 --> 12:16.270
So many good things.

12:16.270 --> 12:17.650
Start at the feet
and work our way up?

12:17.650 --> 12:19.690
That's how my boyfriend does it.

12:19.690 --> 12:22.400
I know these don't look
comfortable, and they're not,

12:22.400 --> 12:24.610
but how gorgeous are they?

12:24.610 --> 12:26.200
Meghan Markle just wore them
to a Mommy and Me,

12:26.200 --> 12:27.620
and now you can't
find them anywhere.

12:27.620 --> 12:29.410
Love. How much?

12:29.410 --> 12:31.200
Enough to pay for
computer coding classes

12:31.200 --> 12:32.790
for 30 at-risk girls.

12:32.790 --> 12:35.460
I'm sorry, what'd you just say?

12:35.460 --> 12:36.670
$1,500.

12:36.670 --> 12:38.460
Right. Of course.

12:38.460 --> 12:41.170
Imagine them with these pants.

12:41.170 --> 12:43.130
They're handmade
Italian leather,

12:43.130 --> 12:45.840
and they could send
100 girls to science camp,

12:45.840 --> 12:47.760
which would basically
change the world.

12:47.760 --> 12:49.970
(quietly):
What is happening?

12:49.970 --> 12:51.140
Excuse me?

12:51.140 --> 12:52.600
Uh, nothing.

12:52.600 --> 12:56.190
What about this little
slice of heaven?

12:56.190 --> 12:57.980
Hmm!

12:57.980 --> 12:59.690
It's actually on sale
for 500 hot school lunches,

12:59.690 --> 13:01.730
like the one your friend
Tammy never had.

13:01.730 --> 13:04.610
Oh, my God, I'm in hell.

13:04.610 --> 13:06.410
You're right.
I hate it, too.

13:06.410 --> 13:09.620
What if I told you
your bag came in?

13:09.620 --> 13:11.290
Wait, the bag?

13:11.290 --> 13:12.950
The bag.

13:12.950 --> 13:15.750
(gasps)
Oh, my God, yes! Okay.

13:15.750 --> 13:17.830
Go ahead, ring me up.
Walk away.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.840
Oh, Bonnie.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.590
Glad you're here.

13:28.590 --> 13:30.180
Oh, hey.

13:31.970 --> 13:34.140
Now that you've spent
some time with Gary,

13:34.140 --> 13:35.480
what do you think?

13:35.480 --> 13:38.440
I've got to be honest.

13:38.440 --> 13:40.770
He is amazing.

13:40.770 --> 13:43.400
Good. That means a lot to me,

13:43.400 --> 13:45.240
'cause I'm one smitten kitten.

13:45.240 --> 13:48.610
Aw, I bet you're gonna miss him
when he goes back to Chicago.

13:48.610 --> 13:50.240
I know I will.

13:50.240 --> 13:53.950
Can you keep a secret?
Not really, no.

13:53.950 --> 13:56.000
A few more visits
like this one

13:56.000 --> 13:58.580
and I might let Gary
pack me up in his suitcase

13:58.580 --> 14:00.000
and take me to
the Windy City.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.210
Whoa, that's a little fast.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.300
Well, I'm not getting
any younger.

14:05.300 --> 14:07.010
You know, Victor and I,

14:07.010 --> 14:09.430
we used to talk about
going to Paris.

14:09.430 --> 14:11.180
And I thought it would
be too expensive,

14:11.180 --> 14:13.010
so we put it off
and we put it off,

14:13.010 --> 14:14.770
and he died.

14:14.770 --> 14:16.180
Life is short.

14:16.180 --> 14:18.520
I'm sure it'll feel longer
with Gary.

14:20.350 --> 14:23.980
Oh, wow, that's
a snazzy pocketbook.

14:23.980 --> 14:25.570
Yep, very special.

14:25.570 --> 14:28.860
Only five of 'em in the world,
blah, blah, blah.

14:28.860 --> 14:30.320
What's wrong, sweetie?

14:30.320 --> 14:31.990
Yeah. Normally when you
get a new purse,

14:31.990 --> 14:34.330
you hold it up
like The Lion King.

14:34.330 --> 14:36.750
I know. A bag like this
usually gives me a buzz

14:36.750 --> 14:38.370
for three to six
business days,

14:38.370 --> 14:39.750
but I feel nothing.

14:39.750 --> 14:42.920
I look at it, nothing.
Touch it, nothing.

14:42.920 --> 14:44.590
Nothing.

14:44.590 --> 14:46.630
Maybe you should have
bought something with batteries.

14:48.930 --> 14:51.050
(laughing)
What?

14:51.050 --> 14:54.680
Gary just sent me the
funniest Far Side cartoon,

14:54.680 --> 14:56.770
where the cats are
smarter than humans.

14:56.770 --> 14:59.560
Oh, Gary...
Oh, Gary...

15:01.270 --> 15:02.980
(movie playing indistinctly)

15:02.980 --> 15:06.730
Hey, Jill, what do you got
in that candy basket?

15:07.740 --> 15:11.110
Oh, there's Mars Bars,
Nestle Crunch, Twix,

15:11.110 --> 15:14.530
Red Vines, KitKat, Reese's
Peanut Butter Cups and M&Ms.

15:14.530 --> 15:16.120
No Good & Plenty?

15:16.120 --> 15:20.370
No, just the seven
I mentioned.

15:20.370 --> 15:22.210
I'll pass.

15:22.210 --> 15:23.710
You like Twix.

15:23.710 --> 15:26.380
Not for a movie.

15:26.380 --> 15:29.260
Who brings a man to
ladies movie night?

15:29.260 --> 15:31.430
I mean, it's Beaches,
for God's sake.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.890
And if he doesn't sob
when Barbara Hershey dies,

15:33.890 --> 15:36.010
I swear to God...

15:36.010 --> 15:38.180
Shh!

15:38.180 --> 15:40.810
Did I just get shushed
in my own damn screening room?

15:40.810 --> 15:43.020
Oh, he's big on the shushing.

15:43.020 --> 15:44.940
He probably shushes Marjorie
during sex.

15:44.940 --> 15:46.150
(chuckles)

15:46.150 --> 15:48.150
He does not.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.780
Hey, birds in the back row,

15:52.780 --> 15:55.280
if it was me, I'd go
to another room.

15:57.330 --> 15:59.950
It's a big house.
Plenty of choices.

15:59.950 --> 16:02.000
Unlike your candy selection.

16:12.840 --> 16:14.390
Between you and me,

16:14.390 --> 16:15.970
I do have Good & Plentys
in the pantry,

16:15.970 --> 16:18.890
but I am not getting
on a step stool for that man.

16:18.890 --> 16:21.680
Wow. You know,
this really is gorgeous.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.520
Yeah, who cares?

16:23.520 --> 16:24.980
What?

16:24.980 --> 16:27.570
I hope you know you
ruined shopping for me.

16:27.570 --> 16:29.860
I used to love spending money
on myself.

16:29.860 --> 16:32.030
Now all I can see is
a bunch of little Tammys

16:32.030 --> 16:34.490
getting screwed out of
opportunities they deserve.

16:34.490 --> 16:36.990
Wow, look at you, caring more
about other people

16:36.990 --> 16:38.580
than about how you look.

16:38.580 --> 16:40.700
Oh, now, that can't be true.

16:40.700 --> 16:43.040
All right.

16:43.040 --> 16:44.870
Which one makes you happier?

16:48.750 --> 16:50.800
Think faster,
the purse is heavy.

16:50.800 --> 16:53.800
Empowered little girls,

16:53.800 --> 16:57.430
or a dead cow
with a scarf on it.

16:57.430 --> 16:58.850
Damn it!

17:00.810 --> 17:02.640
We had to get out of there.

17:02.640 --> 17:06.850
Gary and Marjorie are
sucking face.

17:06.850 --> 17:08.860
Okay, I have to ask.

17:08.860 --> 17:10.360
What does she like
about that man?

17:10.360 --> 17:11.780
I can't figure it out,

17:11.780 --> 17:14.200
and I find the good
in everybody.

17:16.410 --> 17:19.240
I'm an alcoholic.
My name is Gary.

17:19.240 --> 17:21.120
ALL:
Hi, Gary.

17:21.120 --> 17:23.790
I see you do the one aisle
down the middle.

17:23.790 --> 17:26.330
I mean, if it was me,
I'd do two aisles.

17:26.330 --> 17:28.960
You know, more end seats.

17:28.960 --> 17:31.460
Or do folks not have
to pee in Napa?

17:31.460 --> 17:33.090
(laughing)

17:33.090 --> 17:37.510
My sobriety date is
April 10, 1995.

17:37.510 --> 17:39.890
My wife was pregnant
with our son,

17:39.890 --> 17:42.180
and, uh, you know,
she'd had it with me.

17:42.180 --> 17:45.270
She threw me out,
and I thought, um,

17:45.270 --> 17:49.190
great, I get to drink
the way I want.

17:52.230 --> 17:57.780
And that is the scariest thought
I ever had in my life.

17:57.780 --> 18:00.280
I realized that I was...

18:00.280 --> 18:02.830
picking alcohol over my family.

18:04.700 --> 18:09.790
So I ended up in a meeting,
and I've been sober ever since.

18:13.550 --> 18:18.510
And my son is 25 years old now,
and, uh...

18:18.510 --> 18:20.970
he's struggling with
his own addiction.

18:23.640 --> 18:27.520
It's brought me to my knees.

18:29.310 --> 18:31.310
I mean, the other day
I was at a meeting,

18:31.310 --> 18:35.230
and, uh, you know, I hadn't
heard from him in-in months.

18:35.230 --> 18:37.450
I was spinning.

18:37.450 --> 18:40.490
You know,
I-I could just picture him

18:40.490 --> 18:44.160
overdosing somewhere, alone.

18:47.370 --> 18:50.370
And, uh, my buddy came up to me,
and he, uh...

18:50.370 --> 18:54.750
he pointed to this-this shaky
newcomer across the room.

18:54.750 --> 18:57.840
He was a young guy,
and he said to me,

18:57.840 --> 19:02.510
"You know,
that's somebody's son, too.

19:02.510 --> 19:07.020
Why don't you see if
he wants a cup of coffee."

19:07.020 --> 19:09.850
Now I get to sponsor that kid.

19:09.850 --> 19:14.360
And he's doing great.

19:14.360 --> 19:17.530
Maybe someday a guy will

19:17.530 --> 19:20.990
get my son a cup of coffee.

19:24.450 --> 19:26.870
You know, I used to drink
because

19:26.870 --> 19:29.790
I didn't know what was
gonna happen.

19:29.790 --> 19:33.920
And now I stay sober
for that same reason.

19:43.300 --> 19:45.390
And are we absolutely sure that
the number on this check

19:45.390 --> 19:48.560
is the number you want to give?
Sure am.

19:48.560 --> 19:52.270
Then brace yourself
'cause I'm coming in.

19:52.770 --> 19:55.110
This place is amazing!

19:55.110 --> 19:58.020
An 11-year-old just programmed
a robot to scratch my back,

19:58.020 --> 19:59.860
and now I'm headed
to the kitchen garden

19:59.860 --> 20:02.650
to learn how to plant bok choy.
Come on!

20:02.650 --> 20:05.740
Ah, looks like you got a new
little girl in your program.

20:05.740 --> 20:07.910
Do you do music here?
We do.

20:07.910 --> 20:10.910
You should probably
hide the flutes.
