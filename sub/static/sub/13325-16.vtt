00:00.001 --> 00:04.603
I can't do a job interview
right now. My head's not
in the right place.

00:04.605 --> 00:07.439
I should be in jail,
not lacey.

00:07.441 --> 00:10.709
Lacey was on probation.
She should've known better
than to be shoplifting.

00:10.711 --> 00:14.313
"I should've put
the marshmallows
in my clothes."

00:14.315 --> 00:18.550
I watched her put her hands
in her dress and I tried
to say "stop,"

00:18.552 --> 00:22.021
And then the only sound
that came out was "oh-hh."

00:22.023 --> 00:24.723
You can't sit around
thinking about lacey.

00:24.725 --> 00:27.459
You gotta move forward.
The best way to do that
is to get a job.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.762
It's what lacey
would want you to do...

00:29.764 --> 00:32.631
If she ever thought about
anybody other than herself.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.666
Why would kate
even hire me?

00:34.668 --> 00:38.037
Because you have all
the qualifications to make
a great receptionist.

00:38.039 --> 00:40.439
You can talk,
you can push buttons,

00:40.441 --> 00:43.675
You're a carbon-based
life form.

00:43.677 --> 00:46.812
But what if kate and I
don't get along?

00:46.814 --> 00:48.781
Look, you have a history
of seeking out women

00:48.783 --> 00:51.150
Who are cold, domineering,
and borderline abusive.

00:51.152 --> 00:52.751
You're gonna love her.

00:52.753 --> 00:55.788
So you think
she'll yell at me?

00:55.790 --> 00:57.589
I don't see why not.

00:59.726 --> 01:02.161
Hey, come on.
I got a lot of
work to do.

01:04.697 --> 01:07.199
Fix your hair.
This is a job interview.

01:08.468 --> 01:10.803
I like her.

01:10.805 --> 01:13.072
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

01:16.509 --> 01:19.411
So, nolan,
tell me about
yourself.

01:19.413 --> 01:22.781
Well, I think my resume
speaks for itself.

01:24.117 --> 01:26.251
From '98 to '98,

01:26.253 --> 01:27.653
I worked at taco bell.

01:27.655 --> 01:31.623
And then from
'98 to '98,

01:31.625 --> 01:33.292
I worked at jiffy lube.

01:33.294 --> 01:35.294
<i>Uh...</i>

01:35.296 --> 01:38.330
- And then in '98, uh...
- Can I see that for a minute?

01:42.836 --> 01:45.204
But I still have
14 more years to go.

01:45.206 --> 01:47.439
On your resume or to tell us
what's left in '98?

01:49.509 --> 01:51.877
Would you mind waiting
in the reception area
while kate and I talk?

01:55.482 --> 01:57.449
Oh. I should tell you.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.751
I do suffer
from migraines,

01:59.753 --> 02:03.155
So there'll be days that
the office has to be
pitch-black.

02:06.860 --> 02:10.362
So what's it gonna take
to land this guy?

02:10.364 --> 02:13.465
I know, I know.
He's a mess, but hire him
and I'll owe ya.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.200
Okay.
What do I get?

02:15.202 --> 02:17.669
How does an entire night of
passionate lovemaking sound?

02:17.671 --> 02:21.140
- Exhausting.
- Then give him the job
or that's what you'll get.

02:22.342 --> 02:24.910
Uh-uh. You're gonna
have to do better.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.845
This guy's like
a human rescue dog.

02:26.847 --> 02:29.581
He's cute and he's sweet,
but soon as I leave,

02:29.583 --> 02:31.617
He'll whine
and pee on the couch.

02:31.619 --> 02:33.352
Okay, how 'bout this?

02:33.354 --> 02:36.455
I give you my credit card
and you go crazy at
agent provocateur.

02:36.457 --> 02:39.158
Ooh, can I get
the fishnet bodysuit
with the horsehair whip?

02:40.560 --> 02:42.661
- You can if you hire nolan.
- Fine.

02:45.465 --> 02:47.533
You know the whip
isn't for show.

02:51.304 --> 02:54.640
After four hours
of trying to lead
this woman to fashion sanity,

02:54.642 --> 02:56.909
She picks out the pink
leopard-skin coat.

02:56.911 --> 02:58.944
I thought,
"she has to be
a hooker."

02:58.946 --> 03:02.548
Patrick, you really gotta work
on being less judgmental.

03:02.550 --> 03:04.850
Just because she has
a bold fashion sense

03:04.852 --> 03:06.251
Doesn't mean
she's a prostitute.

03:06.253 --> 03:09.188
She offered to pay me
with her mouth.

03:09.190 --> 03:12.391
Well, that <i>does</i> mean
she's a prostitute.

03:12.393 --> 03:16.361
That reminds me,
how's lacey doing
in the hoosegow?

03:16.363 --> 03:19.298
I talked to her last night.
She's having a hard time
in jail.

03:19.300 --> 03:20.766
And, big surprise,

03:20.768 --> 03:22.868
She's getting into it
with some of the other inmates.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.804
So I've arranged to do
an anger management session
at the jail.

03:25.806 --> 03:29.408
Might wanna consider
wearing some protection
over your, eh,

03:29.410 --> 03:31.276
Private parts.

03:31.278 --> 03:34.780
Otherwise,
those cats will be
scratching at your post.

03:35.982 --> 03:39.284
Well, thanks for that
homespun wisdom.

03:39.286 --> 03:41.587
So, nolan.
How do you like
working for kate?

03:41.589 --> 03:43.488
I've never been
so fulfilled.

03:43.490 --> 03:45.991
I made some coffee,
did some filing,

03:45.993 --> 03:48.827
Saw some crazy
half-naked pictures of her,

03:48.829 --> 03:52.998
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's this about pictures?

03:53.000 --> 03:55.901
That was my bad.

03:55.903 --> 03:58.337
I opened up her
outgoing mail by mistake

03:58.339 --> 03:59.771
And a lingerie photo
fell out.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.873
With a lot of shaking...

04:01.875 --> 04:05.010
A bunch of other photos
fell out by mistake, too.

04:05.012 --> 04:08.447
How can you not
tell the difference
between outgoing

04:08.449 --> 04:09.982
And incoming mail?

04:09.984 --> 04:12.284
When you're facing
the desk,

04:12.286 --> 04:15.354
The outgoing is on the right,
but then when you're sitting
behind the desk,

04:15.356 --> 04:16.922
It switches to the left.

04:16.924 --> 04:19.258
It's like stairs.

04:19.260 --> 04:21.026
Are they going up?
Are they going down?

04:21.028 --> 04:22.728
Who knows?

04:23.930 --> 04:25.998
All right. I'll see
everybody next week.

04:29.035 --> 04:31.003
Nolan, can I talk
to you for a minute?

04:31.005 --> 04:33.038
- Is everything okay?
- Everything's fine.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.807
Everything's fine.
It's just there's
a lot of stress

04:35.809 --> 04:38.477
In a new job
and it can affect
one's memory.

04:38.479 --> 04:40.646
So I thought we'd do
some quick memory exercises

04:40.648 --> 04:42.981
- And make sure
everything's okay.
- Okay.

04:42.983 --> 04:45.017
Completely off
the top of my head

04:45.019 --> 04:46.918
And unrelated
to anything,

04:46.920 --> 04:49.621
Can you remember

04:49.623 --> 04:53.325
Where dr. Wales
was sending those
naked pictures of herself?

04:53.327 --> 04:56.028
Oh, man.
I don't know.

04:56.030 --> 04:58.530
Work must be really
stressing me out.

04:58.532 --> 05:00.565
Think, nolan, think.

05:00.567 --> 05:03.802
All I can tell you
is what she was wearing.

05:03.804 --> 05:06.571
It was black
and see-through.

05:06.573 --> 05:08.907
Her boyfriend bart's
a lucky guy.

05:08.909 --> 05:11.910
Bart?
Who's bart?

05:11.912 --> 05:14.546
I don't know.
She wrote it on the picture,

05:14.548 --> 05:17.316
"bart, for your eyes only.
Katie."

05:17.318 --> 05:19.418
Katie?
Since she was
eight years old,

05:19.420 --> 05:21.920
Her nickname's
been dr. Wales.

05:21.922 --> 05:25.657
- Is it bad I saw those?
- I wouldn't tell dr. Wales

05:25.659 --> 05:28.060
And I certainly wouldn't
tell her that you told me.

05:28.062 --> 05:32.931
Based on the pictures
of her crawling around
on the mirror,

05:32.933 --> 05:35.600
I don't think
she embarrasses easily.

05:35.602 --> 05:38.704
Yeah, she is
a confident woman.

05:38.706 --> 05:41.773
Who drinks milk
out of a saucer
like a cat.

05:45.511 --> 05:48.013
Hi, everybody.
I'm charlie goodson.

05:48.015 --> 05:50.749
I am an
anger management
therapist.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.918
There's been
some issues on
this cellblock,

05:52.920 --> 05:54.820
So dr. Cynthia thought
it'd be a good idea

05:54.822 --> 05:57.956
If I sat in for her
while she recovered
from her injuries.

05:59.092 --> 06:00.592
Oh, and she wanted me
to tell you guys,

06:00.594 --> 06:02.661
"that was not cool
at all."

06:02.663 --> 06:06.131
You know, you look like
you keep it real nice
down there.

06:07.533 --> 06:10.001
Yeah, bet you're bigger than
your wrists would indicate.

06:11.604 --> 06:13.372
Let's keep it
professional,
ladies.

06:13.374 --> 06:16.742
But, yes, my wrists
are misleadingly slim.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.845
Now, I know some of you
might be wondering,

06:19.847 --> 06:23.148
"can a man
relate to women's
anger issues?"

06:23.150 --> 06:24.983
<i>Well, the truth is,</i>

06:24.985 --> 06:26.952
Most men
have female traits.

06:26.954 --> 06:29.554
Just as I'm sure
most of you have...

06:29.556 --> 06:31.823
Female traits.

06:33.459 --> 06:35.694
It says here there was
an incident recently.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.095
And as an
unbiased observer

06:37.097 --> 06:38.930
Who doesn't know
anybody here...

06:43.436 --> 06:46.571
I think I can
mediate objectively.
Ahem.

06:46.573 --> 06:49.875
Now, I understand
it's easy for men
to voice their anger

06:49.877 --> 06:52.577
And women are taught
sometimes to withhold
their anger--

06:52.579 --> 06:54.646
I'ma gut this ho
like a puppy.

06:55.815 --> 06:57.783
Actually, I believe
the expression is

06:57.785 --> 07:00.619
"gut this ho
like a trout."

07:00.621 --> 07:04.689
She always talks like that.
Yesterday, she said she was
gonna stab me in the face.

07:04.691 --> 07:08.593
Not true. She said,
"you got a face that
was good for stabbing."

07:08.595 --> 07:11.596
- It was a compliment.
- Ladies, ladies.

07:11.598 --> 07:14.766
Donna certainly seems
to have a big problem
with lacey,

07:14.768 --> 07:16.835
- But let's hear it
from her directly.
- All right.

07:16.837 --> 07:19.638
Curry spice over here
is trying to steal
my girlfriend.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.907
I am not, bitch.
I just gave her
a makeover.

07:21.909 --> 07:25.210
- Yeah, makeover, my ass.
- I would, but I don't have
that kind of time.

07:25.212 --> 07:27.112
Women:
Hey-yy!

07:27.114 --> 07:30.682
Sounds to me
like kim and donna
are in a relationship

07:30.684 --> 07:33.919
And donna is experiencing
jealousy over lacey
giving kim a makeover.

07:33.921 --> 07:35.854
I just wanted
to feel pretty.

07:35.856 --> 07:38.690
And you totally are.
You look crazy hot.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.625
- Hey!
- Easy, donna.
Easy, donna.

07:40.627 --> 07:44.596
There's no way she
could've possibly
meant that.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.631
You got the nerve
to come in here

07:46.633 --> 07:48.567
With your fancy
education

07:48.569 --> 07:51.136
And your belt
and your shoelaces.

07:52.638 --> 07:54.806
What do you know about
what goes on in here?

07:54.808 --> 07:57.542
Yeah, you don't know
nothing about jealousy.

07:57.544 --> 08:00.078
Oh, I know jealousy.
Believe me.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.713
I'll share
a little.

08:01.715 --> 08:04.549
Recently I found out
that my girlfriend

08:04.551 --> 08:07.686
Was sending some
suggestive pictures
to another man.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.855
I'm struggling with
jealousy as well,

08:09.857 --> 08:11.690
But I've got it
under control.

08:11.692 --> 08:13.825
Mm-hmm.
If you got everything
so under control,

08:13.827 --> 08:16.862
Why is your lady
sending naked pictures
to another man?

08:16.864 --> 08:18.797
We have an arrangement.
We see other people.

08:18.799 --> 08:21.566
( scoffs )
pss-shew, I wouldn't
lick that stamp.

08:21.568 --> 08:22.868
Somebody else
been licking it.

08:22.870 --> 08:26.705
- Am I right?
- ( women yell )

08:26.707 --> 08:29.975
No, no, no.
Ours is not really
a traditional relationship.

08:29.977 --> 08:32.711
Yeah, it's a relationship
built on lies.

08:32.713 --> 08:35.013
It's a little more
sophisticated than that.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.915
We have a noncommittal,
purely physical,

08:36.917 --> 08:40.118
Friendly, but not
emotional arrangement...

08:40.120 --> 08:42.754
Built on lies.

08:42.756 --> 08:45.123
Look, donna.
I didn't mean to
humiliate you

08:45.125 --> 08:48.560
The way this woman
is obviously humiliating
charlie.

08:48.562 --> 08:50.762
All right.

08:50.764 --> 08:52.764
I won't stab you
in the face.

08:54.133 --> 08:56.101
Thanks.

08:56.103 --> 08:59.671
Think maybe you could
give me a makeover, too?

08:59.673 --> 09:02.574
That depends--
is that really just a trick

09:02.576 --> 09:04.109
So you can stab me
in the face?

09:06.178 --> 09:07.712
Kinda.

09:10.783 --> 09:12.817
A dream analysis
is tricky,

09:12.819 --> 09:15.787
But the flat tires
could represent
your frustration

09:15.789 --> 09:18.290
With the slow progress
of your ongoing
anger issues

09:18.292 --> 09:21.293
And the scary
hermaphrodite

09:21.295 --> 09:24.796
Might relate to when
you were at the women's prison

09:24.798 --> 09:27.832
And you saw
the scary hermaphrodite.

09:29.669 --> 09:32.671
You see, that's why
you've got the phd.

09:32.673 --> 09:35.340
Well, I gotta go, charlie.
My 4:00 will be here
any minute.

09:35.342 --> 09:38.877
- Kate, before I go, can I
ask you a quick question?
- Mm-hmm.

09:38.879 --> 09:41.746
- Our arrangement
hasn't changed, right?
- What arrangement?

09:41.748 --> 09:44.950
You know, if one of us
is seeing somebody,
they tell the other.

09:44.952 --> 09:47.953
Are you trying to tell me
you're seeing somebody?

09:47.955 --> 09:50.121
No, no.
<i>I'm</i> not.

09:50.123 --> 09:53.758
Well, <i>o-kay.</i>

09:53.760 --> 09:55.193
See ya later.

09:57.330 --> 10:00.865
- So our arrangement
is the same.
- Yes.

10:00.867 --> 10:03.902
'cause if I was seeing
somebody, you'd be
the first to know.

10:03.904 --> 10:08.239
Obviously, I'd be the first
and then the girl, of course,

10:08.241 --> 10:11.610
She'd be in on it, too,
but then you.

10:11.612 --> 10:14.212
Well, I got the bronze.
Hey, at least I medaled.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.814
Goodbye, charlie.

10:21.287 --> 10:23.688
Nolan,
remember the guy

10:23.690 --> 10:25.790
That kate sent
those pictures to
the other day?

10:25.792 --> 10:28.126
I sure do.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.829
Hey, my memory's back.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.797
Guess I'm not
so stressed anymore.

10:32.799 --> 10:36.901
Great. I need you
to go in kate's phone
and get me his address.

10:36.903 --> 10:38.770
Oh, I'm sorry, charlie.

10:38.772 --> 10:40.105
I like kate,
I like this job,

10:40.107 --> 10:41.973
And if I go through her phone,
she'll fire me.

10:41.975 --> 10:45.076
Okay. I didn't want
to have to tell
anybody this,

10:45.078 --> 10:47.245
But I'm throwing
a surprise party for her

10:47.247 --> 10:50.215
And it just
wouldn't be the same
without good old...

10:50.217 --> 10:52.751
That bart guy.

10:52.753 --> 10:53.952
Where you gonna have it?

10:53.954 --> 10:56.121
At a bowling alley.

10:56.123 --> 10:58.156
So you'll get me
that address?

10:58.158 --> 11:00.158
But kate hates bowling.
We gotta find another place.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.193
Fine. You get me that address
and I'll find another place.

11:02.195 --> 11:05.830
You know what's good?
A batting cage.

11:05.832 --> 11:08.933
- Perfect. We'll have
the party at a batting cage.
- Or disneyland.

11:08.935 --> 11:12.003
Just get me
the address, okay?

11:12.005 --> 11:16.007
Fine. You know,
it doesn't seem like you put
a lot of thought into this.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.110
Remember,
don't tell kate anything.

11:19.112 --> 11:22.113
Well, there's nothing to tell
because of your poor planning.

11:24.784 --> 11:26.351
<i>( knocks on door )</i>

11:32.224 --> 11:33.958
- Hey, nolan.
- Hey.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.460
You get that guy's name
and address I asked for?

11:35.462 --> 11:39.164
Yeah. I got it
out of her phone when
she went to the bathroom.

11:39.166 --> 11:42.267
Oh, that is great.
I really appreciate this.

11:42.269 --> 11:44.335
See ya later.

11:46.305 --> 11:48.940
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

11:48.942 --> 11:51.076
It's just, uh...

11:51.078 --> 11:53.144
I haven't got
my invitation yet.

11:54.280 --> 11:57.182
- Invitation?
- To the surprise party.

11:57.184 --> 11:59.350
I virtually
planned the thing.

11:59.352 --> 12:02.187
Oh.

12:02.189 --> 12:04.055
Turns out her buddy bart
told her about it.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.390
Ruined the whole thing.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.358
Then why do you need
his address?

12:07.360 --> 12:09.994
Well, someone's gotta
write him an angry letter.

12:12.098 --> 12:14.733
No, sam.
I'm not buying you
another pair of boots.

12:14.735 --> 12:17.168
You got one pair
at my house and
two pair here.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.204
Yeah, but if you guys
hadn't gotten divorced,

12:19.206 --> 12:21.106
Then all of my boots
would be at one house

12:21.108 --> 12:23.208
And this wouldn't
even be a problem.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.210
Don't you guys
even feel guilty
about that?

12:25.212 --> 12:27.078
Sam, your mom and I
were doing fine.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.180
It was your boot habit
that tore us apart.

12:30.783 --> 12:33.118
Okay.
Different approach.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.352
Sincerity.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.888
It would really mean
a lot to me

12:36.890 --> 12:38.356
If you guys bought me
these boots.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.959
Different approach.
Sarcasm.

12:40.961 --> 12:44.195
Yeah, sure. You'll have
those boots any day now.

12:44.197 --> 12:46.865
Final approach.
Lying.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.333
Love you.

12:53.405 --> 12:55.106
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.242
Can I ask you something?

12:57.244 --> 13:00.278
All that time
that I cheated on you,

13:00.280 --> 13:03.114
Did you ever get the urge
to confront any of the women?

13:03.116 --> 13:05.917
What?
You cheated on me?

13:07.286 --> 13:09.554
Seriously,
I know it's
a weird question,

13:09.556 --> 13:11.189
But do you think
you would've gotten some

13:11.191 --> 13:13.124
Sense of satisfaction
from it?

13:13.126 --> 13:14.993
For all I know,

13:14.995 --> 13:17.228
I've met a bunch of 'em
and didn't even know it.

13:17.230 --> 13:20.498
I mean, at the movies,
at the grocery store,

13:20.500 --> 13:24.102
At the homewrecking skank
convention.

13:24.104 --> 13:27.205
You know, every year,
I say I'm gonna go.

13:27.207 --> 13:28.807
( sighs )

13:28.809 --> 13:31.342
And every year,
I don't.

13:31.344 --> 13:34.913
I thought about it,
but then I realized

13:34.915 --> 13:37.282
It's not gonna make me
feel any better

13:37.284 --> 13:39.551
To confront them
face-to-face.

13:39.553 --> 13:43.254
And showing up on
some stranger's doorstep
just makes you pathetic.

13:43.256 --> 13:45.323
Yeah,
you're probably right.

13:54.066 --> 13:55.834
Hi. Can I help you?

13:55.836 --> 13:57.902
Wow, look at
the wrists on you.

14:00.005 --> 14:02.106
Look, I don't exactly
know why I'm here.

14:02.108 --> 14:04.609
I just felt like
we had to meet.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.444
Obviously,
kate means a lot
to both of us.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.146
Who?

14:08.148 --> 14:11.015
Kate. Kate wales.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.951
Katie.

14:12.953 --> 14:16.020
Oh, the girl
in the pictures.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.555
She got it going on.

14:19.325 --> 14:20.859
Hey, bart,
show some respect.

14:20.861 --> 14:23.161
Oh, you're here to see bart.
I'm his nurse.

14:23.163 --> 14:24.629
His nurse?

14:24.631 --> 14:27.999
Yeah. Come on in.

14:28.001 --> 14:30.301
I still enjoyed
the naked pictures,
though.

14:30.303 --> 14:33.004
I get it, I get it.
You're a nurse, but
you're straight.

14:34.273 --> 14:36.207
<i>( machine beeping )</i>

14:39.345 --> 14:41.512
Bart, somebody's here
to see you.

14:43.582 --> 14:46.584
Wow. You're bart?

14:46.586 --> 14:49.254
Computerized voice:
<i>Are you here to fix</i>
<i>the keyboard?</i>

14:49.256 --> 14:53.291
<i>The va-va-va-vee</i>
<i>is sticking.</i>

14:53.293 --> 14:55.226
No, no.
No, I'm not.

14:55.228 --> 14:58.229
I'm charlie goodson.
I'm a friend of kate wales.

14:58.231 --> 15:01.332
<i>Oh, so what</i>
<i>can I do for you?</i>

15:01.334 --> 15:04.369
Look, I'm sorry
to barge in like this.

15:04.371 --> 15:07.472
Truth is, I'm involved
with kate and I care
about her very much.

15:07.474 --> 15:10.141
Are you and kate
in a relationship?

15:10.143 --> 15:12.677
<i>A relationship</i>
<i>with kate?</i>

15:12.679 --> 15:16.180
<i>Sarcastic ha.</i>
<i>Sarcastic ha.</i>

15:16.182 --> 15:18.149
<i>Sigh.</i>

15:18.151 --> 15:19.517
So you're not?

15:19.519 --> 15:21.319
<i>We were once,</i>

15:21.321 --> 15:23.588
<i>But as soon as</i>
<i>it got serious,</i>

15:23.590 --> 15:25.556
<i>She broke up</i>
<i>with me.</i>

15:25.558 --> 15:27.025
So she ended it, huh?

15:27.027 --> 15:30.561
<i>Yes, and it hit me</i>
<i>like a ton of bricks,</i>

15:30.563 --> 15:34.365
<i>As did the actual</i>
<i>ton of bricks</i>

15:34.367 --> 15:36.301
<i>That hit me a week later</i>

15:36.303 --> 15:39.337
<i>On a construction site.</i>

15:39.339 --> 15:42.240
Oh, so that's how
you ended up in the--

15:42.242 --> 15:44.175
Dumb question.

15:44.177 --> 15:46.311
<i>It's all right.</i>

15:46.313 --> 15:49.147
<i>I still have</i>
<i>a fulfilling life.</i>

15:49.149 --> 15:53.084
<i>Sarcastic ha.</i>
<i>Sarcastic ha.</i>

15:53.086 --> 15:54.552
Look, again,
I'm sorry to bother you.

15:54.554 --> 15:57.388
I just-- I found out kate
was sending you pictures.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.390
Kate and I are
in a relationship.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.392
Well, it's not really
a relationship. It's--

16:01.394 --> 16:03.361
<i>And it never</i>
<i>will be.</i>

16:03.363 --> 16:05.330
You'll never
get more than that.

16:05.332 --> 16:08.733
<i>She's a cold one,</i>
<i>that kate.</i>

16:08.735 --> 16:11.002
She is kind of robotic

16:11.004 --> 16:14.205
And hearing it in
that voice really
drives it home.

16:14.207 --> 16:16.674
<i>It would be</i>
<i>intolerable</i>

16:16.676 --> 16:19.143
If she didn't have
such a sweet

16:19.145 --> 16:21.512
<i>Va-va-va-va--</i>

16:21.514 --> 16:23.548
<i>Heart.</i>

16:26.418 --> 16:28.019
Yeah, I feel your pain.

16:28.021 --> 16:30.555
<i>Stop bragging.</i>

16:30.557 --> 16:32.490
Okay.
I'm gonna get
going now.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.225
Is there anything
I can do for you?

16:34.227 --> 16:35.326
<i>Yes.</i>

16:35.328 --> 16:37.562
<i>Can you pull out</i>
<i>that plug?</i>

16:37.564 --> 16:40.698
<i>The grey one.</i>
<i>It goes to the lamp.</i>

16:40.700 --> 16:42.734
Sure.

16:44.737 --> 16:48.106
Hey, this is the plug
to your life support machine.
You want me to kill you?

16:48.108 --> 16:51.542
<i>If it's not</i>
<i>too much trouble.</i>

16:52.478 --> 16:54.412
I'm sorry.
I can't do that.

16:54.414 --> 16:56.147
<i>Never mind,</i>

16:56.149 --> 16:58.282
<i>But could you help me</i>

16:58.284 --> 17:01.219
<i>With my medication</i>
<i>before you go?</i>

17:01.221 --> 17:03.621
Turn it up to 10.

17:05.424 --> 17:06.791
It's on one now.
Wait.

17:06.793 --> 17:08.659
That'll kill you, too.

17:10.729 --> 17:14.032
How 'bout
I turn it up
to three

17:14.034 --> 17:15.666
And just get you
really high?

17:15.668 --> 17:17.802
<i>Sold.</i>

17:22.041 --> 17:26.144
- Morning, nolan.
- Oh, hey, dr. Wales.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.312
When you borrowed
my phone

17:28.314 --> 17:30.048
To make a call,

17:30.050 --> 17:32.383
Did you do
anything else with it?

17:32.385 --> 17:33.651
No.

17:35.320 --> 17:38.523
I'm going to give you
one more chance to
tell me the truth

17:38.525 --> 17:40.558
Before I show you
the video

17:40.560 --> 17:43.361
You accidently took
when you were on my phone.

17:44.296 --> 17:47.331
You're bluffing.
Nobody's that stupid.

17:49.301 --> 17:52.203
Oh, no.
This isn't the address book.

17:53.372 --> 17:55.373
What were you doing
in my address book, nolan?

17:55.375 --> 17:57.241
I'm sorry.

17:57.243 --> 18:00.311
It's just that
charlie needed that
bart guy's address.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.280
( scoffs )
son of a bitch.

18:02.282 --> 18:04.816
I can't tell you any more
because of the party.

18:04.818 --> 18:07.385
Damn it, nolan!

18:07.387 --> 18:10.455
It's supposed
to be a surprise--
damn it, nolan!

18:11.857 --> 18:14.692
Kate, please,
act like you don't know.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.527
There is
no party, nolan.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.863
Perfect.
Thanks.

18:21.166 --> 18:22.633
<i>( knocks on door )</i>

18:28.574 --> 18:31.309
Oh, hey.
If this is a booty call,
I can't right now.

18:31.311 --> 18:34.645
- Sam will be home soon.
- How dare you!

18:34.647 --> 18:37.415
Fine, I'll send 'em
to the movies for
a few hours.

18:37.417 --> 18:40.618
I can't believe you
violated my privacy
like this!

18:40.620 --> 18:42.386
And what kind of
a therapist

18:42.388 --> 18:44.589
Would use their patient
to spy on somebody?

18:44.591 --> 18:47.358
I don't know.
An unconventional one.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.694
A maverick,
if you will.

18:49.696 --> 18:52.563
My relationship with bart
is none of your business.

18:52.565 --> 18:55.500
Nothing is. You don't
share anything with me.
I tell you everything.

18:55.502 --> 18:58.336
My innermost thoughts,
my feelings, everything
that's happened to me.

18:58.338 --> 19:01.439
Because I'm your therapist,
you dumbass.

19:01.441 --> 19:03.574
I just don't understand why
you had to keep it a secret.

19:03.576 --> 19:06.444
I mean, okay. You dated
the guy, he had this
terrible accident,

19:06.446 --> 19:09.380
And now you're doing this
sweet thing for him--

19:09.382 --> 19:10.915
Wait a minute...

19:10.917 --> 19:12.650
I know why you didn't
want me to know.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.786
- Why?
- Because it's sweet.

19:15.788 --> 19:18.156
( chuckles )
you are sweet.

19:18.158 --> 19:21.425
- I am not.
- Yes, you are.

19:21.427 --> 19:24.295
You're a big, soft pile
of sentimental goo and you
don't want me to know it.

19:24.297 --> 19:25.830
That is absolutely
not true.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.599
Just because I do
something decent
for a guy

19:28.601 --> 19:32.270
Who happened to fall
in love with me and have
his whole world cave in

19:32.272 --> 19:33.538
Does not make me
an emotional pile--

19:33.540 --> 19:35.573
What are you doing?

19:35.575 --> 19:37.341
Trying to comfort you.

19:38.510 --> 19:41.445
I have to go
rip nolan a new one.

19:41.447 --> 19:43.781
Must be hard since
you're such a softie.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.216
Shut up!

19:45.218 --> 19:47.451
It is so cute
when you try to act
tough now.

19:47.453 --> 19:49.353
Oh, I hate you!
I am leaving!

19:53.792 --> 19:55.393
If you need a hug,
I'm here.

19:57.896 --> 20:00.264
Now you're sweet
and off-balance.

20:04.703 --> 20:08.306
Everywhere I look,
there's relax the back
stores.

20:08.308 --> 20:09.907
Relax the front.

20:09.909 --> 20:12.410
Now, that's
a business model.

20:12.412 --> 20:14.478
It's actually
the oldest business model.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.380
Weren't you there
for the grand opening?

20:17.950 --> 20:21.285
Lacey just pulled up.
Everybody get ready.

20:21.287 --> 20:23.921
Now, I wanna surprise her,
so don't tell her I got a job.

20:23.923 --> 20:26.757
( cell phone chimes )

20:26.759 --> 20:29.994
Okay, don't tell her
I lost my job.

20:29.996 --> 20:33.598
- I'm out!
- Oh, there she is.

20:33.600 --> 20:36.367
Everything is
so much different now.

20:36.369 --> 20:38.469
The clothes,
the music...

20:38.471 --> 20:41.906
- No, it's just
a really boring bar.
- Oh, thank god.

20:41.908 --> 20:44.275
I wanna let you know,
the whole time you
were inside,

20:44.277 --> 20:46.310
- I was faithful.
- Oh.

20:46.312 --> 20:48.980
Yeah, well, I was...

20:48.982 --> 20:50.648
I missed you, too.
( giggles )
