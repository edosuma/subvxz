03:51.865 --> 03:55.867
M-A-P-P-L-E-T-H-O-R-P-E.

03:55.869 --> 03:57.736
I did that job last week.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.739
The piano move.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.774
Well, I was just wondering
if you have any...

04:02.776 --> 04:05.811
Okay, well, I'm available
anytime over the summer.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.779
Okay, thank you.

04:21.728 --> 04:23.028
Thank you.

04:25.699 --> 04:27.833
That's not enough.

04:27.835 --> 04:30.469
Yeah. I mean, I thought since
there's only two hours left,

04:30.471 --> 04:32.804
you might do me a favor.

04:33.974 --> 04:35.607
Come back when
you have more.

04:35.609 --> 04:36.908
Please.

04:39.713 --> 04:42.581
And he's allowed me
to go up to the mountain.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.884
And I've looked over.

04:45.886 --> 04:50.389
And I have seen
the Promised Land.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.476
I need your help.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.348
- Sure.
- I'm Patti.

05:16.350 --> 05:17.984
Just pretend you're
my boyfriend, all right?

05:17.985 --> 05:19.851
- Hey.
- Thank you so much for lunch,

05:19.853 --> 05:22.454
but I found
who I've been looking for.

05:22.456 --> 05:24.389
- I just want to talk.
- Bye.

05:24.391 --> 05:25.924
This poem is great.

05:25.926 --> 05:28.427
I mean, it's great.

05:28.429 --> 05:29.795
Yeah?

05:29.797 --> 05:31.797
What else do you do?

05:31.799 --> 05:33.598
- I draw.
- Oh.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.834
Paint.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.837
- You gay?
- No. Why?

05:38.839 --> 05:40.672
Do I seem like I am?

05:40.674 --> 05:43.408
No. Not really.

05:43.410 --> 05:45.110
Where do you live?

05:45.112 --> 05:47.112
I'm sort of in
between places right now.

05:47.114 --> 05:49.014
- Yeah, me too.
- Oh, yeah?

05:49.016 --> 05:51.350
I have a place to crash though,
in Brooklyn.

05:51.352 --> 05:54.753
It's just a shitty room.
It's somewhere, you know?

05:57.057 --> 06:00.058
So, she did
that in... in pen.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.127
It's better in pen.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.463
Wow.

06:04.465 --> 06:06.732
Yeah, this is some
crazy shit.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.768
Really? Wow. Thanks.

06:13.941 --> 06:16.842
You get this good
going to Pratt, huh?

06:16.844 --> 06:19.111
Pratt was just a way
out of Floral Park

06:19.113 --> 06:22.147
because it was my dad's
Alma mater.

06:22.149 --> 06:24.649
I've been drawing
my whole life.

06:24.651 --> 06:25.984
Yeah? He an artist too?

06:25.986 --> 06:28.720
My dad?
No, he's an engineer.

06:28.722 --> 06:31.456
He takes pictures,
but he's no artist.

06:35.796 --> 06:39.030
Well, uh, I guess I got
to get going.

06:39.032 --> 06:40.699
What? Where?

06:40.701 --> 06:42.701
You know...

06:42.703 --> 06:45.704
No. Stop. Don't go.
You got a bed.

06:45.706 --> 06:48.774
Look, I'll take the couch.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.008
Don't go.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.177
Okay.

06:52.179 --> 06:54.980
Thanks.
It's been rough.

06:54.982 --> 06:57.015
But I'll make it.
I've been through worse.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.619
Had a feeling
the moment I saw you.

07:02.489 --> 07:03.855
Like Mutt and Jeff,
you know?

07:03.857 --> 07:06.758
Ricky and Lucy?

07:08.662 --> 07:10.162
I'm fascinating,
I know.

07:10.164 --> 07:12.931
Boy...

07:12.933 --> 07:15.033
What are you going to do
with this, huh?

07:16.937 --> 07:20.539
"What will become of the world
when no trace of you remains?"

07:24.878 --> 07:27.779
I think there'll be
some traces.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.117
How was your day?

07:32.119 --> 07:33.885
Good.

07:38.792 --> 07:43.094
So, I'm channeling
Duchamp tonight.

07:43.096 --> 07:46.031
That's so different.
That's terrific. Yeah.

07:46.033 --> 07:47.232
Yeah?

07:48.635 --> 07:49.968
Thank you.

07:54.708 --> 07:57.242
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

08:07.621 --> 08:09.221
Yeah.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.134
But I wonder
if they'd get it.

09:29.136 --> 09:30.735
Who?

09:30.737 --> 09:32.804
Everyone.

09:32.806 --> 09:35.674
Everyone else.
Everyone who's not us.

09:35.676 --> 09:38.310
I don't think they see the world
like we do.

09:40.013 --> 09:42.180
Our world knows me.
I don't give a shit.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.582
Our world.

09:43.584 --> 09:44.950
Yeah.

09:44.952 --> 09:47.252
Nobody lives there
but us, right?

09:47.254 --> 09:48.753
Right.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.322
You like it, yeah?

09:52.626 --> 09:54.192
I told my parents
we got married

09:54.194 --> 09:56.895
in a strawberry field
in California.

09:56.897 --> 09:58.663
What?

09:58.665 --> 10:00.632
Why'd you do that?

10:02.202 --> 10:03.969
It's a beautiful picture.

10:12.646 --> 10:15.880
Don't ever leave me, Patti.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.820
"Joe leaves his job
as a dishwasher

10:21.822 --> 10:23.355
and takes a bus
to New York City."

10:23.357 --> 10:25.256
That's you.

10:25.258 --> 10:27.926
"Where he meets the sickly,
streetwise Ratso."

10:27.928 --> 10:29.928
That's me.

10:29.930 --> 10:32.864
"They eventually become friends,
companions and soul mates,

10:32.866 --> 10:34.933
and help each other survive
in the big city."

10:34.935 --> 10:36.635
Hey, it sounds like us.

10:36.637 --> 10:38.770
What do you say, Joe?
Let's go.

10:38.772 --> 10:42.407
Patti, don't eat like an animal.
That's disgusting.

10:42.409 --> 10:45.043
- All right, shepherd boy.
- I know, but...

10:45.045 --> 10:47.846
You're sitting there
straight out of Holy Land.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.347
Give me the cookie.
It's my day.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.182
You've eaten, like,
the whole of it.

10:51.184 --> 10:52.884
All right, you have
the sweet tooth anyway.

10:52.886 --> 10:54.252
I'm just hungry.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.391
I need a favor.

10:59.393 --> 11:01.826
- Okay.
- Give me your hand.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.995
Aw, come on.
Seriously?

11:03.997 --> 11:05.730
Yeah. Come on.

11:05.732 --> 11:07.032
Aw, you got to be kidding.

11:07.034 --> 11:08.833
No, look.

11:08.835 --> 11:10.436
You'll see when you meet
my mom and my dad.

11:10.437 --> 11:13.071
It's just, if they don't
think we're married...

11:13.073 --> 11:14.973
officially...

11:16.143 --> 11:17.909
it'll just be,
you know...

11:17.911 --> 11:19.278
- Here, I got you.
- They're Catholic.

11:19.279 --> 11:21.279
Like, really Catholic.

11:22.716 --> 11:24.716
I'm your family now.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.053
Yeah.

11:28.055 --> 11:30.289
Bless us, O Lord, for these
gifts we are about to receive

11:30.290 --> 11:33.925
from thy bounty, through Christ,
our Lord, amen.

11:33.927 --> 11:35.927
Amen.

11:47.240 --> 11:50.809
It's so nice to finally
meet you, Patricia.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.210
Can I get you
anything else?

11:52.212 --> 11:53.778
No, thank you,
Mrs. Mapplethorpe.

11:53.780 --> 11:56.047
And please,
call me Patti.

11:56.049 --> 12:01.219
All right, so, tell us
the story of your union.

12:03.457 --> 12:04.956
I mean...

12:06.760 --> 12:09.194
when and where
did you two get married?

12:09.196 --> 12:10.395
Thank you.

12:10.397 --> 12:13.965
Oh, we met in California, Mom.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.767
Right after college.

12:15.769 --> 12:18.002
After you dropped out
of Pratt, right?

12:18.004 --> 12:20.839
Yeah, right after that.

12:20.841 --> 12:23.208
Big waste of time and money.

12:23.210 --> 12:24.876
Edward, eat your beans.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.813
So, what do you do Patricia...
Patti?

12:28.815 --> 12:30.248
I'm an artist.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.183
Like Robert.

12:33.887 --> 12:35.820
Have you thought
about children?

12:35.822 --> 12:38.156
Children, Joan?

12:38.158 --> 12:40.191
These two can barely
take care of themselves.

12:40.193 --> 12:42.994
Actually, we take pretty good
care of each other...

12:42.996 --> 12:44.329
Dad.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.272
Thank you very much.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.341
- Really lovely to meet you.
- Bye, Dad.

12:56.343 --> 12:58.276
Why do we even bother?

12:58.278 --> 13:00.445
He's going to end up a deadbeat,
looking like a girl.

13:05.018 --> 13:07.085
You should tell them
to fuck themselves.

13:07.087 --> 13:08.453
Yeah.

13:09.456 --> 13:10.955
They're my family.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.461
Aw, baby.

14:27.868 --> 14:30.201
Okay, five dollars.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.036
- Yeah, this is good.
- Take that.

14:38.612 --> 14:40.345
Is that okay?

14:41.514 --> 14:43.548
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Stop! Stop!

17:03.423 --> 17:05.223
My name is Patti Smith,

17:05.224 --> 17:07.191
and I'm here
with Robert Mapplethorpe.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.160
- Uh-huh.
- You may not know us yet,

17:09.162 --> 17:11.362
but we're going to be
big stars one day.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.598
Only today we don't
have any money.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.200
But...

17:16.202 --> 17:17.635
take a look for yourself.

17:26.613 --> 17:28.311
Take it all.
For collateral.

17:30.216 --> 17:33.051
Okay. Okay.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.521
Rent's generally due
first of the month.

17:36.523 --> 17:39.590
And I'm going to hold on
to these until you can make it.

17:44.330 --> 17:46.397
Mr. Bard, you will not
regret this.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.166
You got a room?

17:49.836 --> 17:51.369
Thank you.

17:54.507 --> 17:57.141
Thank you, Mr. Bard.

- Hmm?

18:25.872 --> 18:27.672
I think I'm going to try
and sell these

18:27.674 --> 18:29.841
so we can get
our work back faster.

18:29.843 --> 18:33.511
I want to try to do
something around, like a cloth.

18:33.513 --> 18:36.380
Yeah. Okay.
Got to go to work.

18:36.382 --> 18:38.216

18:47.560 --> 18:49.393
Can I get my work back, please?

18:49.395 --> 18:51.262
- Hey, Robert!
- What? Hey!

18:51.264 --> 18:52.463
You coming by?

18:52.465 --> 18:53.898
Yeah. Five.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.800
- Cool.
- Excellent.

18:58.671 --> 19:00.905
- Hey, Robert.
- Digging the necklace.

19:00.907 --> 19:02.607
Nice.

19:02.609 --> 19:05.276
- You look cool, man.
- Peace, man.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.286
Oh, hello.

19:16.589 --> 19:17.788
Hey.

19:17.790 --> 19:19.557
What do you think?

19:19.559 --> 19:21.526
Whose is it?

19:21.528 --> 19:24.162
It's as if Steichen and Munch
had a prodigal daughter.

19:24.164 --> 19:25.563
Ja?

19:25.565 --> 19:27.465
It's one of mine.

19:28.434 --> 19:29.734
I think it's cool.

19:30.703 --> 19:31.936
I'm Sandy Daley.

19:33.339 --> 19:34.572
I'm Robert Mapplethorpe.

19:34.574 --> 19:35.806
Oh.

19:35.808 --> 19:37.909
You're our newest patient, huh?

19:37.911 --> 19:41.946
This is actually a photograph
of me and a former lover.

19:41.948 --> 19:44.649
Inspired by Bellocq.

19:44.651 --> 19:46.551
You know Bellocq?

19:46.553 --> 19:49.187
He was one of the first
great masters.

19:49.189 --> 19:50.621
Wow, that's great.

19:50.623 --> 19:53.224
I love that.

19:53.226 --> 19:55.193
So is that.

19:55.195 --> 19:57.328
He scratched out the face.
I've done that.

19:57.330 --> 19:58.796
You do that?

19:58.798 --> 20:00.298
Yeah.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.599
I'd like to see it.

20:03.269 --> 20:05.369
Yeah, I got some right here.
This one.

20:08.474 --> 20:10.741
- I mean, you know,
it's not...

20:10.743 --> 20:12.577
Oh, yes. I see.

20:12.579 --> 20:14.212
That's better.

20:14.214 --> 20:15.746
This is potent imagery.

20:15.748 --> 20:17.448
Thanks.

20:17.450 --> 20:19.483
You really should take
your own pictures.

20:19.485 --> 20:21.285
Why don't you?

20:21.287 --> 20:22.987
Printing. Re-printing.
The dark room.

20:22.989 --> 20:25.523
It takes so much time.

20:25.525 --> 20:29.293
And I can't be just Mapplethorpe
the photographer, you know?

20:30.530 --> 20:32.797
I want magic.
Majesty.

20:34.267 --> 20:36.567
I want to be a modern
Michelangelo.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.903
And you think if Michelangelo
had a camera,

20:38.905 --> 20:40.705
he wouldn't have used it?

20:48.014 --> 20:49.547
Wow.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.549
Pull that out,

20:51.551 --> 20:53.517
and it's ready to go.

20:53.519 --> 20:55.853
- That's the focus?
- Mm-hmm.

20:55.855 --> 20:57.421
And remember,

20:57.423 --> 20:58.956
it's always about
the light.

20:58.958 --> 21:01.425
Whether you paint it
or shoot it,

21:01.427 --> 21:04.395
you have to find it
or make it.

21:04.397 --> 21:05.696
And that takes talent.

21:08.268 --> 21:09.800
Can I take a picture
of your flowers?

21:09.802 --> 21:11.469
Yes, you can.

21:11.471 --> 21:13.704
- Please.
- All right.

21:26.352 --> 21:28.986
Take the bloody picture.

21:35.595 --> 21:37.795
Voilà.

21:38.831 --> 21:40.965
There you go.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.600
Keep it for a while.

21:42.602 --> 21:44.802
You sure?

21:45.838 --> 21:47.738
Cross your legs.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.507
That's good.

21:49.509 --> 21:51.842
Look at me.
Okay, now you lean on him.

21:52.745 --> 21:54.679
Yeah, nice.

21:54.681 --> 21:56.414
Think your worst thought.

21:58.318 --> 22:01.519
Stand there.
Hold back.

22:27.980 --> 22:29.914
- Thank you, Patti.
- Mm-hmm.

22:29.916 --> 22:32.583
So, look, I made 27 bucks.
I sold three necklaces.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.352
- All right.
- But I kind of want

22:34.354 --> 22:36.387
to keep this one,
because it's cool.

22:36.389 --> 22:38.689
Yeah.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.891
Robert Mapplethorpe,
for all your voodoo needs.

22:40.893 --> 22:42.860
Yeah, well, do me a favor
and cast a spell

22:42.862 --> 22:45.429
on Tinkerbelle over there
who can't stop staring at me.

22:45.431 --> 22:48.132
She loves you.

22:48.134 --> 22:50.000
I love you.

22:50.002 --> 22:52.636
Good, because you're
stuck with me.

22:54.741 --> 22:56.073
Robert. Patti.

22:56.075 --> 22:58.642
- This is David Croland.
- Hey.

22:58.644 --> 23:02.513
Bobby, you never
come see me.

23:02.515 --> 23:05.383
You and Patti-Cake are so...

23:05.385 --> 23:07.752
Siamese.

23:07.754 --> 23:09.954
You're such a Robert hog.

23:09.956 --> 23:12.923
That's me,
just a little piggy.

23:12.925 --> 23:15.726
I adore it.

23:15.728 --> 23:18.129
It's violent.

23:18.131 --> 23:19.797
It's handmade.

23:19.799 --> 23:22.633
- Thank you.
- Truly.

23:22.635 --> 23:24.702
Can you make one for me?

23:24.704 --> 23:26.837
Yeah, if you have
a craving.

23:35.815 --> 23:37.782
Shit.

23:43.122 --> 23:46.424
Can I wear these
or are they fucking art?

23:54.967 --> 23:56.934
Bye.

23:56.936 --> 23:59.136
Have fun with your family.

25:00.566 --> 25:02.166
Yeah?

25:02.168 --> 25:04.535
It's David. Anybody home?

25:07.974 --> 25:09.607
What's that?

25:10.776 --> 25:12.209

25:12.211 --> 25:14.111

25:18.718 --> 25:20.718

25:20.720 --> 25:22.887

26:18.110 --> 26:19.311

26:19.312 --> 26:20.911

26:22.214 --> 26:23.614

No.

I don't want to.

28:52.064 --> 28:53.797
Get away from me.
Get away from me. No.

28:53.799 --> 28:55.433
- Goddamn it. Get away from me.
- Robert...

28:55.434 --> 28:57.367
Get away from me!
You're the fucking devil.

28:57.369 --> 28:59.103

I don't want this.

No, it's just...

29:23.229 --> 29:25.195
beauty and the devil.

29:25.197 --> 29:29.099
Beauty and the devil are
sort of the same thing to me.

29:30.536 --> 29:33.003
And he's always
been with me.

29:33.005 --> 29:34.404
Like, always.

29:34.406 --> 29:37.508
I guess in church
I found God.

29:37.510 --> 29:40.778
And then when Sandy
gave me the Polaroid,

29:40.780 --> 29:43.147
it led me straight
to the devil.

29:43.149 --> 29:46.817
And now, suddenly,
I'm fucking him.

29:46.819 --> 29:49.520
I'm fucking the devil.

29:49.522 --> 29:52.356
I guess you could say I have
a certain Catholic aesthetic.

29:53.526 --> 29:55.159
Yeah.

29:55.161 --> 29:57.294
Let's explore
that ass-thetic.

29:57.296 --> 29:59.396
Oh, no, fuck.
Patti...

29:59.398 --> 30:01.265
Patti's...
Patti's on her way back.

30:01.267 --> 30:02.499
Patti's coming here.

30:02.501 --> 30:04.301
Patti's not blind, babe.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.303
Surely she knows
that she's got a slippery Jim.

30:06.305 --> 30:08.305
No, she knows nothing, okay?

30:08.307 --> 30:10.340
And that's how
it's going to stay.

30:12.878 --> 30:14.178
Okay.

30:16.081 --> 30:18.115
- Sure.
- What?

30:19.485 --> 30:21.318
David, what...
You're not leaving.

30:21.320 --> 30:24.087
David. Oh, come on.

30:24.089 --> 30:27.357
I don't mind you playing
everyone for a fool, okay?

30:27.359 --> 30:30.093
But you want a boyfriend,
and a girlfriend,

30:30.095 --> 30:31.562
and...

30:31.564 --> 30:33.463
I want you.

30:36.402 --> 30:38.969
You decide.

30:38.971 --> 30:40.304
David.

30:40.306 --> 30:42.039
Don't leave.

30:42.041 --> 30:43.561
You're going to leave me
when I'm high?

31:48.641 --> 31:50.240
Come on!

32:05.424 --> 32:08.492
Look, I find myself
wanting to touch them.

32:10.162 --> 32:13.397
And, uh, take...
Take pictures of them.

32:15.267 --> 32:18.101
You can't take
enough pictures of me.

32:20.439 --> 32:22.506
You're the best.
Silky.

32:22.508 --> 32:24.341
I love taking pictures of you,
of course.

32:24.343 --> 32:26.343
But, it's just...

32:26.345 --> 32:29.379
I can't...
I can't stop myself.

32:34.653 --> 32:37.120
Guess I always knew.
I just...

32:37.122 --> 32:39.323
didn't want to.

32:43.362 --> 32:44.728
Yeah.

32:46.065 --> 32:48.465
Nothing's going to change.

32:48.467 --> 32:51.201
I'm not... I'm not...
I'm not leaving us.

32:53.539 --> 32:55.105
Ever.

33:02.381 --> 33:04.314
What are you doing?

33:04.316 --> 33:05.749
Hey.

33:05.751 --> 33:07.584
Hey, Patti,
what are you doing?

33:07.586 --> 33:09.453
You can't leave.
This is... this is our world.

33:09.455 --> 33:12.022
What about Mutt and Jeff,
and Ricky and Lucy?

33:12.024 --> 33:13.490
Ratso and Joe.
What are you doing?

33:13.492 --> 33:15.492
- I'm not leaving that.
- Patti, please.

33:15.494 --> 33:17.694
Stop. Stop.

33:17.696 --> 33:19.363
Stop.

33:19.365 --> 33:21.264
No, you can't leave...

33:21.266 --> 33:23.700
I'm not leaving the fucking
solar system, Robert.

33:23.702 --> 33:25.569
You are the fucking
solar system!

33:25.571 --> 33:27.504
This is the solar system.
You can't leave.

33:27.506 --> 33:29.673
Yes, I can.
Just get a grip.

33:29.675 --> 33:32.476
Please, no...
But you don't...

33:32.478 --> 33:34.177
Patti...

33:35.381 --> 33:37.214
If you leave me, then...

33:39.618 --> 33:41.251
I'll become gay.

33:42.554 --> 33:44.254
- I will.
- Well, so be it.

33:44.256 --> 33:46.623
But I got to take care
of myself, okay?

33:50.429 --> 33:52.029
Don't go.

33:55.034 --> 33:56.700
Don't go.

33:56.702 --> 33:58.802
Don't leave me here.
Don't.

34:03.442 --> 34:05.542
Don't go. Don't go.
Don't go.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.544
- My heart hurts too.
- No...

34:08.714 --> 34:10.213
Patti.

34:11.350 --> 34:13.617
Patti. Patti!

34:26.130 --> 34:27.731
I don't think so.

34:27.733 --> 34:29.632
- No.
- Okay.

34:31.235 --> 34:33.136
Yeah, well,
thank you for your time.

34:35.706 --> 34:37.340
Robert Mapplethorpe.

34:39.511 --> 34:41.110
- No.
- Okay.

34:41.112 --> 34:42.612
Thank you for your time.

34:42.614 --> 34:44.681
Mr. Liu, this is
Robert Mapplethorpe.

34:47.386 --> 34:49.418
What are you trying to say?

34:49.420 --> 34:51.621
It's visual art.
It speaks for itself.

34:51.623 --> 34:53.824
I can't sell these,
I'm afraid.

34:53.826 --> 34:55.458
- Why?
- I can't even show them.

34:55.460 --> 34:57.094
- Time to go.
- What do you mean?

34:57.096 --> 34:58.862
These people
are the gatekeepers?

34:58.864 --> 35:01.098
- Look what's on your walls.
- Okay, let's go.

35:01.100 --> 35:02.766
Is that moving?
Does that provoke you?

35:02.768 --> 35:04.701
- Does that make you think?
- Mr. Mapplethorpe...

35:04.703 --> 35:06.436
- Okay.
- They're keeping us out.

35:06.438 --> 35:08.338
There's no keeping you out,
Robert.

35:08.340 --> 35:10.307
- You're on the threshold.
- But they can't see.

35:13.245 --> 35:15.512
- See you on Tuesday.
- Thank you.

35:18.417 --> 35:19.783
Switch sides.

35:19.785 --> 35:22.419
Stop. Move around.
This side.

35:22.421 --> 35:24.421
Hold that.

35:27.159 --> 35:29.626
More? Thank you.

35:29.628 --> 35:33.730
<i>♪ I was smiling hard ♪</i>

35:34.900 --> 35:38.168
<i>♪ But I was lying ♪</i>

35:40.339 --> 35:44.508
<i>♪ Then you sailed along ♪</i>

35:44.510 --> 35:47.177
Well, it's about
bloody time.

35:55.687 --> 35:57.621
Thank you for your time.

35:57.623 --> 35:59.690
Thank you for your attention.
I really appreciate it.

35:59.691 --> 36:01.691
I'm sorry,
it just doesn't...

36:01.693 --> 36:03.927
You've got shit on the wall
and you don't give a fuck.

36:03.929 --> 36:05.729
- Why do you bring me to these?
- Robert...

36:05.731 --> 36:07.230
I can't even...

36:09.935 --> 36:12.769
David Croland, on your knees,
right where I left you.

36:12.771 --> 36:14.871
Sam. Love.

36:14.873 --> 36:16.573
What are you
getting up to?

36:16.575 --> 36:18.308
I'm good.

36:18.310 --> 36:20.877
Just 19th century, mostly.
Some Sufism.

36:20.879 --> 36:24.915
So, who was the sumptuous storm
cloud that just ran out of here?

36:24.917 --> 36:27.617
That's Robert,
the shy pornographer.

36:27.619 --> 36:29.619
A handful.

36:29.621 --> 36:32.756
He raging because galleries
won't take on his cock photos.

36:32.758 --> 36:33.957
Go figure.

36:33.959 --> 36:35.458
Really?

36:39.731 --> 36:40.931
Really?

36:40.933 --> 36:43.400
Uh-oh.

36:43.402 --> 36:44.935
Where is he?

36:44.937 --> 36:46.570
I'll get you
a phone number.

36:46.572 --> 36:48.405
Good.

36:51.810 --> 36:54.244
Hi, is this the shy
pornographer?

36:54.246 --> 36:55.745
Uh, that depends.

36:55.747 --> 36:57.414
Who's asking?

36:57.416 --> 36:59.216
I'm a collector.

36:59.218 --> 37:00.584
My friend David
told me about you.

37:00.586 --> 37:02.319
Oh, really?

37:02.321 --> 37:04.788
So, is the sailor
accepting visitors?

37:04.790 --> 37:06.623
Yeah, he is.

37:06.625 --> 37:08.358
Come aboard.

37:08.360 --> 37:09.593
Good. Good.

37:09.595 --> 37:11.628
Where should we meet?

37:11.630 --> 37:14.464
Uh, how about my studio?

37:15.767 --> 37:17.534
33 West 11th.

37:17.536 --> 37:20.303
Yeah, which is at
33 West 11th.

37:20.305 --> 37:21.938
Great. When's good for you?

37:21.940 --> 37:25.909
Friday afternoon, say,
like 3:00.

37:25.911 --> 37:27.310
Okay.

37:27.312 --> 37:29.312
I will see you then.

37:30.415 --> 37:32.249
Pretty cool.

37:32.251 --> 37:33.985
- It's all happening, Robert.
- Fucking insane.

37:33.986 --> 37:36.019
I'm going to call Maxine
at her studio.

37:36.021 --> 37:37.988
It's all happening.

37:37.990 --> 37:39.856
Really?

37:42.728 --> 37:44.261
Hello?

38:03.382 --> 38:04.848
Oh. Hey.

38:04.850 --> 38:06.416
Oh, hi.

38:06.418 --> 38:08.652
I'm Sam. Sam Wagstaff.

38:08.654 --> 38:10.420
I'm Robert.

38:10.422 --> 38:11.855
Nice to meet you.

38:11.857 --> 38:13.423
Thank you.
Nice to meet you, too.

38:14.626 --> 38:16.293
It kind of flows this way.

38:17.929 --> 38:20.797
- Are these your drawings?
- Yeah, they're all mine.

38:27.539 --> 38:29.606
I like the music.

38:34.880 --> 38:36.946
So, I started
with the drawings,

38:36.948 --> 38:39.649
but actually now I'm more
interested in the Polaroids.

38:47.492 --> 38:49.993
This is you.

38:49.995 --> 38:51.428
Yeah.

38:51.430 --> 38:52.729
Good subject.

38:58.070 --> 38:59.936
You know all these people?

38:59.938 --> 39:01.504
I do.

39:07.446 --> 39:10.347
They must trust you.

39:10.349 --> 39:11.715
They do.

39:12.684 --> 39:14.684
Good.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.853
Good.

39:16.855 --> 39:19.422
It's fantastic.

39:20.125 --> 39:21.524
Thank you.

39:21.526 --> 39:22.892
You're welcome.

39:22.894 --> 39:24.661
It's good to meet you.

39:24.663 --> 39:26.663
- Thank you for stopping by.
- Yeah.

39:26.665 --> 39:28.365
Let me show you out.

39:28.367 --> 39:30.367
Okay.

39:38.977 --> 39:41.644
You know, you don't really
have to escort me

39:41.646 --> 39:43.012
back down to the street.

39:44.583 --> 39:46.116
It's okay.
I have somewhere to be.

39:48.820 --> 39:50.019
Really?

39:51.423 --> 39:52.789
No.

40:06.405 --> 40:08.004
Thank you.

40:10.742 --> 40:12.509
You're welcome.

40:18.884 --> 40:20.784
So...

40:20.786 --> 40:23.119
it's time you know
the truth.

40:24.890 --> 40:27.157
I have a lot of lovers.

40:30.195 --> 40:31.795
That's okay.

40:31.797 --> 40:34.597
I'd like you to meet
some of them.

40:35.734 --> 40:38.101
Your lovers?

40:38.103 --> 40:39.869
I mean these.

40:45.043 --> 40:46.810
Beautiful, huh?

40:48.113 --> 40:49.612
The Flandrin.

40:49.614 --> 40:51.114
There you are.

40:51.116 --> 40:52.515
- Wow, I like that.
- Yeah?

40:52.517 --> 40:54.184
The Met wants a loan.

40:54.186 --> 40:56.052
I like the shape.

40:57.756 --> 41:01.791
This photograph here,
by Von Gloeden.

41:01.793 --> 41:03.726
It's a replica of the painting
from 1840.

41:03.728 --> 41:05.128
Wow.

41:05.130 --> 41:07.864
It's one of the few photographs
I own.

41:09.601 --> 41:11.134
How old are you?

41:11.136 --> 41:12.702
I'm 50.

41:14.506 --> 41:16.239
That too old for you?

41:16.241 --> 41:18.808
- No. It's good.
- Yeah?

41:19.878 --> 41:21.644
Yeah.

41:21.646 --> 41:24.047
I'll never know
what it's like to be 50.

41:25.617 --> 41:27.650
How are you so sure
about that?

41:29.488 --> 41:31.855
- I just know.
- Yeah?

41:33.191 --> 41:35.758
Are you scared of dying?

41:35.760 --> 41:37.961
Only before I'm famous.

41:39.598 --> 41:42.765
Well, then,
you better get to work.

41:42.767 --> 41:45.535
So much to do,
so little time.

41:45.537 --> 41:47.270
- Come on.
- Oh, no, let's stay in bed.

41:47.272 --> 41:48.905
- Get up. Come on.
- Please. Please.

41:48.907 --> 41:50.240
- I'll take you to the Met.
- No.

41:50.242 --> 41:52.742
- Let's go. Let's go.
- No.

41:54.546 --> 41:57.614
This place was built
on my family's land.

41:57.616 --> 42:00.049
Wow. I love it here.

42:03.054 --> 42:04.521
This is for you.

42:04.523 --> 42:06.122
Thank you.

42:07.759 --> 42:10.560
- So, are you ready?
- Yeah, I think so.

42:10.562 --> 42:12.061
Now I believe that these are

42:12.063 --> 42:14.163
some of the oldest photographs
in existence.

42:14.165 --> 42:15.999
- Nadar, right?
- Yeah.

42:16.001 --> 42:18.134
Yeah, my friend
Sandy told me about him.

42:18.136 --> 42:20.236
Beautiful portraits.

42:20.238 --> 42:22.539
- My God, is that...?
- Look at that.

42:22.541 --> 42:24.040
Is that Sarah Bernhardt?

42:24.042 --> 42:25.608
Yes, it is.

42:25.610 --> 42:27.810
She looks fantastic.

42:27.812 --> 42:30.146
I can't believe
it's not a painting.

42:30.148 --> 42:31.681
You know?

42:31.683 --> 42:34.150
And there she is,
forever.

42:35.954 --> 42:38.187
- Do you collect any?
- No. They're not valuable.

42:38.189 --> 42:40.990
Well, you should.
I think they will be.

42:40.992 --> 42:43.192
No, I think these will be up
on the main floor

42:43.194 --> 42:46.663
with Rodin, Michelangelo,

42:46.665 --> 42:48.631
Mapplethorpe.

42:55.173 --> 42:56.873
Holy shit.

42:56.875 --> 42:58.074
These are gorgeous.

42:58.076 --> 42:59.709
Look at that.

42:59.711 --> 43:01.277
I know. I love that one.

43:01.279 --> 43:03.313
No one's blacks
are blacker than yours.

43:03.315 --> 43:04.948
I swear to God.

43:06.217 --> 43:08.851
Wow, so many new men.

43:08.853 --> 43:12.155
You've become a bit
of a collector yourself.

43:12.157 --> 43:13.957
Should I be concerned?

43:13.959 --> 43:15.592
No.

43:15.594 --> 43:17.360
They're my work.
You're my love.

43:18.930 --> 43:21.064
Well, since you put it
that way.

43:22.767 --> 43:25.335
For you,
my birthday boy.

43:25.337 --> 43:27.370
Apollo 8 used it
to capture the moon.

43:27.372 --> 43:30.273
I thought it's good enough
for my monkey to tell his story

43:30.275 --> 43:31.874
- here on the ground.
- No.

43:31.876 --> 43:33.610
No.

43:33.612 --> 43:35.912
Sammy.

43:35.914 --> 43:37.146
Oh, wow.

43:38.617 --> 43:40.650
- God.
- Oh, one more thing.

43:41.353 --> 43:42.752
Keys.

43:42.754 --> 43:44.787
Your new live-in studio.

43:44.789 --> 43:46.956
What?

43:48.860 --> 43:50.393
Come here.

43:55.300 --> 43:58.368
You're the nicest person
I ever met.

43:59.771 --> 44:01.938
I don't know about that.

44:22.427 --> 44:25.828
Your work is so raw.

44:31.336 --> 44:34.671
I thought maybe I could
shoot some covers for you.

44:44.115 --> 44:45.848
Well...

44:45.850 --> 44:49.285
Sam certainly likes
to keep me on my toes.

44:49.287 --> 44:50.920
Yeah.

44:50.922 --> 44:52.288
These are, uh...

44:52.290 --> 44:54.090
these are quite something.

44:59.297 --> 45:02.732
Okay, forget it.

45:02.734 --> 45:04.233
Excuse me?

45:04.235 --> 45:06.235
If you knew what
you were looking at,

45:06.237 --> 45:09.272
then you wouldn't act like
such a fucking art-snob fag.

45:09.274 --> 45:12.942
Mr. Mapplethorpe, I know exactly
what I am looking at.

45:12.944 --> 45:15.978
And I am a fucking
art-snob fag.

45:15.980 --> 45:17.714
Yeah, I know.

45:18.717 --> 45:19.882
And I do want them.

45:19.884 --> 45:22.051
Yeah? How much?

45:22.053 --> 45:23.953
- A lot.
- No.

45:23.955 --> 45:26.022
How much are you going
to charge to buy them?

45:26.024 --> 45:28.191
A lot.

46:01.426 --> 46:03.526
Little brother.

46:03.528 --> 46:05.428
Hey.

46:09.868 --> 46:11.234
So...

46:11.236 --> 46:13.002
I, um...

46:14.539 --> 46:17.473
I snuck into the city
because I have to...

46:19.177 --> 46:22.945
I have to write a paper
on my hero, and...

46:22.947 --> 46:25.014
I want to write it
about you.

46:25.917 --> 46:27.350
Me?

46:27.352 --> 46:29.018
And I want to study
photography,

46:29.020 --> 46:32.555
but Dad's trying
to talk me out of it.

46:34.425 --> 46:35.825
Okay.

46:35.827 --> 46:37.193
It's cool I'm your hero.

46:37.195 --> 46:39.228
You can write about these.

46:39.230 --> 46:41.264
Yeah, that.
Open it.

46:45.937 --> 46:48.437
- Are your hands clean?
- They're clean.

47:09.961 --> 47:11.327
Wow.

47:12.263 --> 47:13.563
Yeah.

47:18.603 --> 47:20.970
It's pretty cool.

47:20.972 --> 47:24.006
Yeah, it's my friend's fist
up my friend's ass.

47:35.486 --> 47:37.153
- Wow.
- Yeah.

47:38.122 --> 47:39.355
Yeah.

47:39.357 --> 47:41.490
Do me a favor.

47:45.129 --> 47:47.563
Don't tell Mom and Dad about
anything you've seen here today.

47:47.565 --> 47:49.298
Of course.

47:49.300 --> 47:51.000
And can you give them this,
please?

47:51.002 --> 47:52.401
Of course.

47:52.403 --> 47:55.104
And let yourself out, okay?

47:55.106 --> 47:56.472
Okay.

48:00.345 --> 48:01.911
Bye.

48:02.614 --> 48:04.480
Okay, bye.

48:12.156 --> 48:14.290
Okay, bye.

48:14.292 --> 48:16.092
Chin up.

48:16.094 --> 48:18.127
I want you to look
directly at the camera.

48:18.129 --> 48:19.328
Perfect.

48:21.232 --> 48:23.966
That's going to make a beautiful
portrait, thank you.

48:33.945 --> 48:37.480
These photographs
are exquisite.

48:37.482 --> 48:39.682
- Yes, they are.
- Precise.

48:39.684 --> 48:41.317
Uniquely scintillating.

48:41.319 --> 48:42.618
Thank you.

48:44.188 --> 48:47.323
But I can't put
little Jesse McBride,

48:47.325 --> 48:49.492
Philip Glass
and Arnold Schwarzenegger

48:49.494 --> 48:51.460
next to cocks and chains.

48:51.462 --> 48:54.497
I'd have to pass out Valium
at the door.

48:54.499 --> 48:57.033
Show all of my work
or none of it.

48:57.035 --> 48:59.568
I want to.
You're brilliant.

48:59.570 --> 49:03.539
You're the Jekyll and Hyde
of photography.

49:03.541 --> 49:06.275
But the public won't be able
to handle it all at once, dear.

49:06.277 --> 49:08.210
My clients are only
just beginning to grasp

49:08.212 --> 49:10.279
- that photography is art.
- Yeah, um...

49:10.281 --> 49:13.649
see, Holly, Robert doesn't have
a lot of patience for...

49:13.651 --> 49:15.217
- For anything.
- Yeah...

49:18.189 --> 49:21.357
I have an idea
of how Jekyll and Hyde

49:21.359 --> 49:23.960
can both have their debuts
simultaneously.

49:23.962 --> 49:26.228
I'll call you.
You're going to love it.

49:26.230 --> 49:27.530
- Can't wait.
- Yeah.

49:34.238 --> 49:35.538
That's brilliant.

49:38.076 --> 49:40.076
Solomon.

49:40.078 --> 49:41.477
Kitchen.

49:41.479 --> 49:43.179
Very clever.

49:44.649 --> 49:46.549
I'll get it out
to the right people.

49:46.551 --> 49:48.084
Get back to work.

49:48.086 --> 49:49.986
Thanks, Sammy.

49:57.996 --> 49:59.762
- Wow.
- And here we are.

49:59.764 --> 50:02.465
- This is your doing.
- Yeah, a little bit.

50:02.467 --> 50:04.300
You look very smart.

50:04.302 --> 50:07.269
- Okay, go meet the people.
- I love people.

50:09.607 --> 50:11.407
Yeah, I just
always found them

50:11.409 --> 50:14.210
so beautiful to photograph,
actually.

50:14.212 --> 50:16.245
And I want to show you
who you remind me of.

50:16.247 --> 50:18.147
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Excuse me.

50:18.149 --> 50:19.783
- How are you, by the way?
- These are great.

50:19.784 --> 50:22.118
- This is Nick, obviously.
- Oh, wow.

50:22.120 --> 50:25.021
I'm sorry, excuse me.
Larry and Bobby kissing.

50:25.023 --> 50:27.423
And I thought
he was a bit like you.

50:29.027 --> 50:31.427
He's a dealer.
Of art, not drugs.

50:31.429 --> 50:33.496
Oh, come and see Arnold.

50:33.498 --> 50:35.197
Hello.

50:35.199 --> 50:37.199
Oh, you decided
to go with flowers.

50:37.201 --> 50:39.668
Well, you know,
easing the public into it

50:39.670 --> 50:41.203
is an art in itself,
apparently.

50:41.205 --> 50:42.738
Hey!

50:42.740 --> 50:44.473
So I thought,
sell the public my flowers

50:44.475 --> 50:46.275
and then they can hang them
on their walls

50:46.277 --> 50:48.277
without realizing what
they're embracing.

50:48.279 --> 50:50.613
- Are you thrilled?
- Are you coming to the kitchen?

50:50.615 --> 50:52.281
I am, yes!

50:52.283 --> 50:53.550
I want to see your true
masterpieces.

50:53.551 --> 50:54.784
One day they'll be here too.

50:54.786 --> 50:56.552
Mwah.

50:56.554 --> 50:58.287
Thank you.

50:58.289 --> 50:59.622
So, sales?

50:59.624 --> 51:01.190
One.

51:01.192 --> 51:04.794
But he had
to leave it here.

51:04.796 --> 51:06.195
Why's that?

51:06.197 --> 51:08.831
Wife. Kids.

51:08.833 --> 51:10.633
- Hamptons.
- Naturally.

51:12.770 --> 51:15.271
I appreciate your time.
Bye.

51:15.273 --> 51:16.772
- Hey, guys.
- So?

51:16.774 --> 51:18.407
Did you meet the people?

51:18.409 --> 51:20.810
Yeah. I think so.

51:20.812 --> 51:23.612
Leo, Lord Warwick,
Peggy G.

51:23.614 --> 51:25.181
Any other musts?

51:25.183 --> 51:26.715
Great. I don't think so.

51:26.717 --> 51:28.617
As a matter of fact,
let's hightail it.

51:28.619 --> 51:30.352
Shall we?

51:30.354 --> 51:31.721
Another group of admirers
awaits you.

51:31.722 --> 51:33.522
- Okay, thank you.
- Bye, darling.

51:33.524 --> 51:35.191
- I appreciate everything.
- Sure.

51:35.193 --> 51:37.126
- Sell more pictures.
- I will.

51:39.230 --> 51:41.097
Oh, my God.

51:41.099 --> 51:43.099
Touch of leather, Sammy.

51:43.101 --> 51:45.134
A touch of leather, baby.

51:45.136 --> 51:47.336
Well, I guess there's
a first time for everything.

51:51.776 --> 51:53.642
- We're here. We're here.
- Okay, okay.

52:13.264 --> 52:15.197
God almighty,
do you like it?

52:15.199 --> 52:17.233
Do you have any money
to buy anything?

52:17.235 --> 52:18.868
You probably do.

52:21.606 --> 52:23.506
Oh, hi. Wow. Look at you.

52:23.508 --> 52:25.241
Hey!

52:29.881 --> 52:31.647
Oh, look.
Love you. Thank you.

52:44.762 --> 52:46.462
What's on your
mind, monkey?

52:46.464 --> 52:48.364
Patti's moving to Detroit.

52:48.366 --> 52:49.832
Why?

52:49.834 --> 52:51.400
Get married and have children.

52:51.402 --> 52:52.801
Don't worry, monkey.

52:52.803 --> 52:54.603
New York is Patti's
piss factory.

52:54.605 --> 52:56.505
She'll snap out of it.

52:56.507 --> 52:58.440
You know, the first man
I ever fell in love with

52:58.442 --> 53:01.577
served on my ship
during the invasion of Normandy.

53:01.579 --> 53:04.313
I was an officer.
He was a sailor.

53:04.315 --> 53:06.448
Oh, my God,
he was beautiful.

53:06.450 --> 53:08.484
Just like you.

53:10.254 --> 53:12.321
You do know I love you?

53:16.527 --> 53:17.960
I do.

53:19.564 --> 53:22.231
And I love my old thing.

53:22.233 --> 53:23.799
And I always will.

53:36.247 --> 53:37.813
This is Princess Margaret.

53:37.815 --> 53:39.515
She's a friend from Mustique.

53:39.517 --> 53:41.750
How'd you afford
that trip?

53:41.752 --> 53:44.687
A magazine sent me.

53:44.689 --> 53:47.656
This is David Hockney.

53:47.658 --> 53:49.525
- Hockney?
- Yeah, he's a cool guy.

53:49.527 --> 53:51.527
A British artist.

53:51.529 --> 53:54.997
And Princess Devovo.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.734
A princess? From where?

53:58.736 --> 54:01.470
I don't know.

54:01.472 --> 54:03.806
I mean, she doesn't do much
apart from be a princess.

54:05.443 --> 54:07.409
But she takes a good photograph,
I thought.

54:07.411 --> 54:08.877
It's pretty.

54:08.879 --> 54:11.447
Anyway, you guys
must be starving.

54:11.449 --> 54:12.748
Shall we get
something to eat?

54:12.750 --> 54:14.450
Sure.

54:14.452 --> 54:15.918
Yeah. I know a good place,
actually.

54:15.920 --> 54:17.419
It's not far.

54:21.492 --> 54:23.959
You don't print
the pictures yourself?

54:23.961 --> 54:25.494
No.

54:25.496 --> 54:27.029
Never.

54:28.599 --> 54:29.965
But that's photography.

54:29.967 --> 54:31.634
How can you let
someone else

54:31.636 --> 54:33.402
carry out the most
important part?

54:33.404 --> 54:34.938
Well, that's one element
of photography.

54:34.939 --> 54:36.739
Photography is more
than one element.

54:36.741 --> 54:38.874
It's about light.
It's about composition.

54:38.876 --> 54:42.444
It's about the personality
of the subject.

54:44.382 --> 54:45.848
And I'm an artist.

54:47.752 --> 54:50.052
I would've been a painter,
but the camera was invented.

54:50.054 --> 54:51.754
Thank God.

54:51.756 --> 54:53.689
I just think life moves
too fast now

54:53.691 --> 54:56.725
to spend weeks painting it.

54:59.030 --> 55:01.330
Well, you're not
a real photographer

55:01.332 --> 55:02.731
until you know
the technical end.

55:02.733 --> 55:04.033
Period.

55:05.803 --> 55:08.404
Richard divorced
that Oriental girl.

55:08.406 --> 55:09.972
Harry, how do you
say her name?

55:09.974 --> 55:12.007
What does it matter?

55:13.944 --> 55:16.612
I had to quit
the bowling league.

55:16.614 --> 55:17.813
Oh, that's a shame.

55:17.815 --> 55:20.049
I just get too tired.

55:20.051 --> 55:22.718
That's too bad.
Your mother was good.

55:22.720 --> 55:23.720
Mm-hmm.

55:27.825 --> 55:30.559
I liked your show.

55:30.561 --> 55:32.428
Thank you.

55:34.365 --> 55:35.764
I like my flowers.

55:36.867 --> 55:38.634
They're beautiful.

56:25.750 --> 56:27.483
Okay. Fine.

56:27.485 --> 56:29.051
Do you want that?

56:29.053 --> 56:31.920
Go steady, now.

56:31.922 --> 56:34.556
What are you staring at?
You don't like it?

56:34.558 --> 56:37.092
Uh, I don't know, Robert.

56:37.094 --> 56:38.894
It doesn't really
look like me.

56:38.896 --> 56:40.963
It's not your look I'm taking.
It's you.

56:40.965 --> 56:43.098
You're dirty. It's hot.
Look at that.

56:43.100 --> 56:45.134
Whatever you say, man.

56:45.136 --> 56:48.070
All these art snobs
think they're so cutting edge.

56:48.072 --> 56:49.805
I take out my portfolio

56:49.807 --> 56:51.774
and I show them the bullwhip
up my ass.

56:51.776 --> 56:54.476
If they blink
or they look away,

56:54.478 --> 56:56.512
then they just
can't handle it,

56:56.514 --> 56:59.014
because they're not so fucking
cutting edge after all.

57:00.751 --> 57:03.085
- You know?
- You got that right.

57:03.087 --> 57:06.021
I call it, "Playing chicken
with the avant-garde."

57:06.023 --> 57:07.856
It's my favorite pastime.

57:07.858 --> 57:09.892
It's a game
the whole family can play.

57:09.894 --> 57:12.961
You're making me laugh so hard
I got to pee.

57:15.065 --> 57:17.666
Take a piss here
and I'll take pictures of you.

57:17.668 --> 57:19.868
Actually, put your cock
in that champagne glass.

57:19.870 --> 57:21.437
Wait.

57:23.007 --> 57:25.107
Hold that.

57:27.111 --> 57:29.845
You know, McNenny, people think
that you just deal me flowers.

57:30.781 --> 57:32.181
Good boy.

57:32.183 --> 57:34.183
Wait, wait, wait.

57:34.185 --> 57:35.918
Hold on.

57:41.158 --> 57:42.991
Yeah, let's take
some more pictures.

57:42.993 --> 57:45.227
- All right.
- Take off your clothes, guys.

57:48.165 --> 57:49.665
<i>♪ Try it out ♪</i>

58:00.211 --> 58:02.110
You up, superstar?

58:02.112 --> 58:03.946
I just got a call
from the New York Times.

58:03.948 --> 58:08.817
They want a quote from me
about the dual shows.

58:15.593 --> 58:16.859
Sammy's here.

58:16.861 --> 58:18.594
Hey.

58:18.596 --> 58:21.029
Come join us, Sammy.
Come play.

58:21.031 --> 58:23.198
It's a little
sex and magic.

58:30.241 --> 58:31.840
Sammy.

58:31.842 --> 58:33.675
Are you mad? Sam...

58:33.677 --> 58:35.210
Sammy.

58:35.212 --> 58:38.247
Come on, you know, this is...
This is...

58:39.783 --> 58:42.618
this is just how I live.

58:44.054 --> 58:45.888
But it doesn't mean
that I don't...

58:45.890 --> 58:47.523
I don't love you.

58:49.793 --> 58:52.127
Yeah, I love you too, monkey.

58:58.102 --> 59:00.602
Jesus, I wanted
to taste this life.

59:05.843 --> 59:08.210
But I'm full, Robert.

59:10.281 --> 59:11.880
And you should be too.

59:11.882 --> 59:14.249
Sammy, Sammy...

59:14.251 --> 59:16.818
Here.

59:22.026 --> 59:23.825
We'll talk.

01:00:53.784 --> 01:00:55.117
Patti.

01:00:55.119 --> 01:00:56.718
It's Robert.

01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.286
Pick up the phone,
please.

01:00:58.288 --> 01:01:00.689
I'm not going to wreck
your perfect life.

01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:05.394
Okay. Call me back.

01:01:05.396 --> 01:01:06.995
Call me back.

01:01:08.132 --> 01:01:10.132
Call me right fucking back.

01:01:15.773 --> 01:01:17.839
Call me fucking back.

01:01:43.367 --> 01:01:44.966
Hey, excuse me.

01:01:44.968 --> 01:01:47.135
My name is
Robert Mapplethorpe.

01:01:47.137 --> 01:01:48.837
I'm a photographer.

01:01:48.839 --> 01:01:51.106
I'd love to take
your photograph.

01:01:53.477 --> 01:01:55.377
You have the most
striking look.

01:01:55.379 --> 01:01:57.979
I wondered if you'd ever
thought about modeling.

01:01:57.981 --> 01:01:59.414
Modeling?

01:01:59.416 --> 01:02:01.416
- Mm-hmm.
- Man, you walking...

01:02:01.418 --> 01:02:03.185
You scared the shit
out of me.

01:02:03.187 --> 01:02:04.853
You look so fantastic.

01:02:04.855 --> 01:02:08.490
I could help you
make a portfolio.

01:02:08.492 --> 01:02:10.058
And when do you want
to do that?

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:12.160
- Now. Right now?
- Right now?

01:02:12.162 --> 01:02:14.129
Yeah.

01:02:14.131 --> 01:02:15.731
Um...

01:02:18.502 --> 01:02:20.235
I mean...

01:02:20.237 --> 01:02:21.737
all right.

01:02:23.073 --> 01:02:24.506
Wonderful.
What's your name?

01:02:24.508 --> 01:02:25.974
- Milton.
- Milton?

01:02:25.976 --> 01:02:27.242
Yeah. You said Robert, right?

01:02:27.244 --> 01:02:28.877
That's me, yeah.

01:02:37.154 --> 01:02:39.187
That's perfect.
Eyes down.

01:02:41.492 --> 01:02:43.158
Okay.

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:45.460
How about you take off
those pants?

01:02:46.797 --> 01:02:48.797
I can't be doing that,

01:02:48.799 --> 01:02:50.365
out of respect
to my family.

01:02:51.869 --> 01:02:53.335
Can I at least see it?

01:03:00.544 --> 01:03:02.811
That's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

01:03:02.813 --> 01:03:05.547
What if I promise never to show
your cock and your face

01:03:05.549 --> 01:03:07.382
in the same frame?

01:03:07.384 --> 01:03:09.451
Uh...

01:03:19.196 --> 01:03:20.962
Yeah, that's okay.

01:03:22.232 --> 01:03:24.266
Wait there. Just...

01:03:25.369 --> 01:03:27.369
put your right leg out.

01:03:28.839 --> 01:03:30.872
Turn your body
to your right.

01:03:32.142 --> 01:03:33.441
Stop.

01:03:35.445 --> 01:03:37.145
I think I'm in love.

01:03:37.147 --> 01:03:38.947
- I got to go.
- No.

01:03:40.450 --> 01:03:42.150
You're perfect.

01:03:50.594 --> 01:03:52.894
I'm going to take care of you.

01:03:58.268 --> 01:04:00.902
Robert? Ed's here.

01:04:00.904 --> 01:04:02.571
Coming.

01:04:02.573 --> 01:04:04.840
The meeting your mother
wanted me to set up.

01:04:04.842 --> 01:04:06.274
He's here.

01:04:14.852 --> 01:04:17.118
You want me
to look at this?

01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:23.892
Thank you.

01:04:24.862 --> 01:04:26.161
Sit down.

01:04:35.505 --> 01:04:37.372
Of course, I'm...

01:04:37.374 --> 01:04:40.008
I'm still learning, but...

01:04:41.345 --> 01:04:44.246
some of them are good,
right?

01:04:46.450 --> 01:04:48.416
They're all good.

01:04:49.653 --> 01:04:51.386
Just, look, I don't...

01:04:51.388 --> 01:04:54.055
I don't particularly want
my kid brother

01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:55.991
working for me.

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:58.994
But Dad kicked me

01:04:58.996 --> 01:05:01.363
out for wanting to take pictures
for a living.

01:05:01.365 --> 01:05:03.265
Like you.

01:05:03.267 --> 01:05:05.533
- So...
- Dad. Dad.

01:05:07.037 --> 01:05:08.236
Dad.

01:05:08.238 --> 01:05:10.572
Look, Edward,

01:05:10.574 --> 01:05:13.041
only when you cut him off

01:05:13.043 --> 01:05:15.677
are you going to be able to make
the steps that you need to make

01:05:15.679 --> 01:05:18.513
to do something great
with your life.

01:05:18.515 --> 01:05:22.350
I barely even know you, so...

01:05:22.352 --> 01:05:24.085
maybe.

01:05:24.087 --> 01:05:26.187
I don't want any connection
to our family.

01:05:26.189 --> 01:05:28.156
You know, you just...

01:05:28.158 --> 01:05:30.926
you got to leave all of that
stuff out of here, okay?

01:05:32.396 --> 01:05:34.095
Of course.

01:05:34.097 --> 01:05:36.331
- Do you understand that?
- I understand.

01:05:37.367 --> 01:05:38.934
Okay.

01:05:39.636 --> 01:05:41.036
All right.

01:05:41.038 --> 01:05:42.637
Yeah?

01:05:42.639 --> 01:05:44.973
What time's
the next shoot?

01:05:44.975 --> 01:05:46.474
Twelve o'clock, Robert.

01:05:46.476 --> 01:05:48.443
What time is it now?

01:05:48.445 --> 01:05:50.345
Just after 11:00.

01:05:52.215 --> 01:05:54.449
Want to do some cocaine?

01:05:57.654 --> 01:05:59.487
Straight from God.

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:04.659
Come on.

01:06:10.968 --> 01:06:12.233
There you go.

01:06:20.677 --> 01:06:22.978
Okay, let's see.

01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:24.579
Oh, yeah. I love it.

01:06:26.149 --> 01:06:29.417
Yeah, this one.
Burn it a little.

01:06:29.419 --> 01:06:31.152
I don't know, man.

01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:32.621
It's brilliant,
don't you think?

01:06:32.622 --> 01:06:34.622
Aw, come on.

01:06:34.624 --> 01:06:37.359
Yeah, the only thing you need to
know is where the darkroom is.

01:06:37.361 --> 01:06:41.029
You come in, get the film,
go print, and you go home.

01:06:41.031 --> 01:06:42.998
Okay?

01:06:44.568 --> 01:06:46.067
Crop it.

01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:47.369
Take off his head.

01:06:47.371 --> 01:06:48.770
It's stronger without it.

01:07:27.044 --> 01:07:28.343
Move.

01:07:35.719 --> 01:07:38.386
Curator.
Can you define it?

01:07:40.524 --> 01:07:44.592
A guy who chooses art pieces
for other folks to check out.

01:07:44.594 --> 01:07:47.195
Ugh! Where's Edward?

01:07:47.197 --> 01:07:49.130
Ed.

01:07:49.132 --> 01:07:51.499
I think we need to get
your English teacher to focus

01:07:51.501 --> 01:07:53.368
on the language
of the arts.

01:07:53.370 --> 01:07:55.437
This isn't... I don't know
what's going on here.

01:07:55.439 --> 01:07:57.572
I can't... you know,
it's this thing here.

01:07:57.574 --> 01:07:59.107
Here we are.
Look at you.

01:08:00.177 --> 01:08:01.576
You look so innocent.

01:08:01.578 --> 01:08:03.311
You're my beautiful
black boy.

01:08:05.816 --> 01:08:07.382
I'm going to put it
back in.

01:08:09.119 --> 01:08:11.152
You're going
to do great.

01:08:13.723 --> 01:08:15.390
Bingo.

01:08:28.738 --> 01:08:30.238
Yeah.

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:32.506
Yeah.

01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:34.809
Yeah. Playboy.

01:08:39.416 --> 01:08:41.850
Yeah. Yeah.

01:08:41.852 --> 01:08:44.551
Can I stick my finger
in your ass?

01:08:44.554 --> 01:08:45.752
Who's a good boy?

01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:58.899
Wrap it over your shoulders.
Like that.

01:08:58.902 --> 01:09:00.502
Yeah.

01:09:01.837 --> 01:09:03.604
Uh...

01:09:03.607 --> 01:09:06.674
I just... I don't know.
I can't see the frame.

01:09:08.578 --> 01:09:10.211
I can't see
the fucking frame.

01:09:11.413 --> 01:09:13.281
Sorry, Lisa.
Just give me...

01:09:13.283 --> 01:09:15.483
I just need a moment.

01:09:27.831 --> 01:09:29.796
Chin up.

01:09:29.799 --> 01:09:32.300
Tense.

01:10:19.583 --> 01:10:21.449
No time for this.

01:10:28.825 --> 01:10:30.658
It's so empty in here.

01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:32.994
Why? Why?

01:10:32.996 --> 01:10:36.297
Why did you sell your
photography collection, Sammy?

01:10:36.299 --> 01:10:38.900
Sentimentality is
the kiss of death in art.

01:10:38.902 --> 01:10:40.735
You know that.

01:10:40.737 --> 01:10:42.403
It's too much stuff.

01:10:42.405 --> 01:10:44.472
Let somebody else
take care of it.

01:10:44.474 --> 01:10:47.242
Besides, I'm really
enjoying this.

01:10:47.244 --> 01:10:48.676
I can shine
these spots away.

01:10:49.713 --> 01:10:51.379
Gives me a little hope.

01:10:54.017 --> 01:10:55.683
Only $500.

01:10:55.685 --> 01:10:57.719
For everything.
All these pieces.

01:10:57.721 --> 01:10:59.787
It's unbelievable.

01:10:59.789 --> 01:11:01.856
I bet you this
is the next big thing.

01:11:11.268 --> 01:11:13.568
I've got it, by the way.

01:11:18.308 --> 01:11:20.708
- How do you know?
- I know.

01:11:20.710 --> 01:11:22.577
I'm just waiting
for the test results.

01:11:22.579 --> 01:11:24.812
- That doesn't mean that you...
- Oh, Robert. Robert.

01:11:24.814 --> 01:11:27.715
I wake up every night
covered in sweat.

01:11:27.717 --> 01:11:30.018
Well, so open
your fucking window.

01:11:33.757 --> 01:11:35.423
It has arrived.

01:11:37.594 --> 01:11:38.793
Have you been tested?

01:11:38.795 --> 01:11:40.428
No.

01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:42.030
Monkey, please.

01:11:42.032 --> 01:11:43.798
I won't.

01:12:00.450 --> 01:12:05.086
Your photos are quickly becoming
a gallery of the dead.

01:12:14.931 --> 01:12:16.864
Hey.

01:12:16.866 --> 01:12:18.966
What... what are you...

01:12:18.968 --> 01:12:20.768
What are you doing?
What...

01:12:20.770 --> 01:12:22.503
Milton, what's wrong?

01:12:24.874 --> 01:12:27.442
Whoa, whoa, take it ea...
What are you doing?

01:12:27.444 --> 01:12:29.677
Milton, stop it.
Stop it.

01:12:29.679 --> 01:12:31.779
What are you doing?
I love you.

01:12:31.781 --> 01:12:33.681
Love me?

01:12:33.683 --> 01:12:35.917
- Yeah.
- You don't love me.

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:39.754
You don't love anyone.
You love yourself.

01:12:39.756 --> 01:12:42.090
And how you make people
do shit.

01:12:43.126 --> 01:12:44.926
You make me do shit.

01:12:44.928 --> 01:12:47.462
Read crap I don't get.

01:12:47.464 --> 01:12:48.663
Take it easy.

01:12:48.665 --> 01:12:51.366
And you call me nigger in bed.

01:12:51.368 --> 01:12:53.501
Milton, come on,
that's just a tease.

01:12:53.503 --> 01:12:54.936
It's not meant
as an insult.

01:12:54.938 --> 01:12:56.804
I thought...
I thought you liked...

01:12:56.806 --> 01:12:58.973
Poor nigger who poses
like a nude piece a black meat

01:12:58.975 --> 01:13:00.842
for his pansy boyfriend.

01:13:00.844 --> 01:13:03.077
- Fuck you!
- Whoa, take it easy.

01:13:05.115 --> 01:13:07.715
Okay, Milton, I was trying
to enlighten you.

01:13:07.717 --> 01:13:10.118
To celebrate you.
To celebrate your strength.

01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:12.487
To celebrate your beautiful
black flesh.

01:13:12.489 --> 01:13:15.490
I'm not one of your white boy,
stuck-up sculptures.

01:13:15.492 --> 01:13:17.425
And I sure enough
ain't nobody's nigger.

01:13:17.427 --> 01:13:18.860
All right. Milton...

01:13:19.829 --> 01:13:21.429
Milton.

01:13:21.431 --> 01:13:22.698
Milton, you have been
the subject

01:13:22.699 --> 01:13:24.098
of some of my best work.

01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:25.933
You are the star.

01:13:25.935 --> 01:13:27.869
- Milton.
- You took pictures of my dick

01:13:27.871 --> 01:13:29.070
sticking out of my pants.

01:13:29.072 --> 01:13:30.605
Because it's gorgeous.

01:13:32.709 --> 01:13:34.041
Milton...

01:13:35.945 --> 01:13:38.546
You picked the wrong poor
black boy for your collection.

01:13:38.548 --> 01:13:40.715
Don't go.

01:13:40.717 --> 01:13:42.650
Where are you
going to go?

01:13:44.687 --> 01:13:46.521
Come on, I need you.

01:13:46.523 --> 01:13:48.990
- You got everything you need.
- No.

01:13:51.928 --> 01:13:54.595
- I need money.
- No, Milton. Please.

01:14:00.804 --> 01:14:03.104
Well, you know
where it is.

01:14:03.106 --> 01:14:04.806
Don't...

01:14:09.479 --> 01:14:11.579
Look, let's talk.

01:14:13.883 --> 01:14:15.450
Milton.

01:14:16.152 --> 01:14:17.652
Milton.

01:14:21.024 --> 01:14:22.957
Fuck.

01:14:32.735 --> 01:14:34.068
What do you guys think?

01:14:35.138 --> 01:14:37.138
That one.

01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:38.773
Yeah, that's amazing, Sam.

01:14:38.775 --> 01:14:40.975
Really.

01:14:40.977 --> 01:14:43.578
Another $25,000.

01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:45.580
My biggest sale yet.

01:14:51.154 --> 01:14:53.020
Dead man walking.

01:14:54.891 --> 01:14:57.758
Who knew my stock would rise
with every pound I lose?

01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:59.760
What are... what are these
doing here?

01:14:59.762 --> 01:15:02.230
I thought you might
take a look at them.

01:15:02.232 --> 01:15:04.232
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:15:04.234 --> 01:15:08.035
Why? You don't need my opinion.
You've got my moves down.

01:15:08.037 --> 01:15:09.804
Hey, that's not
what I'm trying to do.

01:15:09.806 --> 01:15:13.207
Plus, you're
the technical expert.

01:15:13.209 --> 01:15:16.110
Yeah, but, I...

01:15:16.112 --> 01:15:19.747
I want your opinion
about the art.

01:15:21.518 --> 01:15:22.850
Because?

01:15:22.852 --> 01:15:25.553
Because you're my brother,

01:15:25.555 --> 01:15:28.956
and because, well, you're better
at this than I am.

01:15:28.958 --> 01:15:31.125
Yeah, well, you know,
I actually have no idea

01:15:31.127 --> 01:15:32.960
how my pictures
look so good.

01:15:32.962 --> 01:15:35.997
It's not something
I can just pass on to you.

01:15:35.999 --> 01:15:38.866
Well, can you at least tell me
which ones you like the best?

01:15:38.868 --> 01:15:40.601
Why?

01:15:40.603 --> 01:15:42.070
I have to pick one
for the group show.

01:15:42.071 --> 01:15:44.138
Next month.

01:15:45.074 --> 01:15:46.674
What?

01:15:48.311 --> 01:15:49.911
The one you're in, too.

01:16:02.892 --> 01:16:06.093
So if we're going
to continue working together,

01:16:06.095 --> 01:16:08.095
you got to change
your last name.

01:16:08.097 --> 01:16:11.666
I have made
Mapplethorpe a name

01:16:11.668 --> 01:16:14.035
through my hard work
over the years.

01:16:14.037 --> 01:16:17.038
I mean, it just...

01:16:18.041 --> 01:16:20.174
here, how about...

01:16:20.176 --> 01:16:23.044
Mom's maiden name.

01:16:23.046 --> 01:16:24.812
Maxey.

01:16:24.814 --> 01:16:26.047
Yeah. Look at that.

01:16:26.049 --> 01:16:28.149
It sounds sexy.

01:16:28.151 --> 01:16:30.284
Use it.

01:16:32.989 --> 01:16:34.789
Look, I'm sorry, Edward.

01:16:34.791 --> 01:16:37.058
I feel like I've done
a lot for you.

01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:38.893
But I've got
to draw the line.

01:16:38.895 --> 01:16:41.796
You can't just keep
riding on my coattails.

01:16:41.798 --> 01:16:46.601
This batch here needs
your technical expertise.

01:16:46.603 --> 01:16:48.002
I'm going out.

01:16:49.739 --> 01:16:51.273
You can't keep
doing this, Robert.

01:16:51.274 --> 01:16:52.873
Doing what?

01:16:52.875 --> 01:16:54.909
Don't you care
about spreading it?

01:16:54.911 --> 01:16:58.379
Well, you know,
that's up to them, not me.

01:16:58.381 --> 01:17:00.848
I can't cheat death,

01:17:00.850 --> 01:17:02.683
but I can cheat life,
which I won't.

01:17:02.685 --> 01:17:05.186
- Robert...
- We're born and die alone.

01:17:05.188 --> 01:17:06.887
- Robert, you're not alone.

01:17:06.889 --> 01:17:08.623
Spend our lives
pretending we're not.

01:17:08.625 --> 01:17:10.024
If I have to change
the way I live,

01:17:10.026 --> 01:17:13.127
then I'd rather not at all,
okay?

01:17:13.129 --> 01:17:14.962
Hey, I'm just paying my dues.

01:17:14.964 --> 01:17:16.664
He's not letting
any of us off easy.

01:17:16.666 --> 01:17:20.034
Technical expertise, Edward.

01:17:20.036 --> 01:17:21.802
Robert!

01:17:32.281 --> 01:17:34.048
Look at them.
They're just superior.

01:17:34.050 --> 01:17:36.117
Smooth, you know?
Muscular shoulders.

01:17:36.119 --> 01:17:38.653
Mm-mm-mm.

01:17:38.655 --> 01:17:39.954
Cock.

01:17:43.993 --> 01:17:45.726
Excuse me.

01:17:56.673 --> 01:17:58.172
Thanks.

01:17:58.174 --> 01:17:59.674
Let's see.

01:17:59.676 --> 01:18:01.175
Take a shot.

01:18:08.751 --> 01:18:10.751
I'm not that great at this.

01:18:14.457 --> 01:18:16.023
Hey.

01:18:16.025 --> 01:18:17.458
Come on, let's go.

01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:19.293
- Where?
- My place.

01:18:19.295 --> 01:18:21.362
Let's go.

01:18:22.965 --> 01:18:25.166
Hug your
knees closer to you.

01:18:25.168 --> 01:18:27.301
A bit tighter.

01:18:27.303 --> 01:18:28.903
Hug them more.

01:18:28.905 --> 01:18:30.771
That's good.
Now hold that.

01:18:32.375 --> 01:18:34.208
Perfect.

01:18:46.789 --> 01:18:48.255
Chin up.
Thank you. Stop.

01:18:50.093 --> 01:18:52.393
Got it. Thank you.
Well done.

01:18:54.897 --> 01:18:56.497
Thank you.

01:18:56.499 --> 01:18:58.099
Jesus Christ.

01:18:58.101 --> 01:18:59.333
I mean, thank God
that is over.

01:18:59.335 --> 01:19:02.136
So, I'm going to go out.

01:19:02.138 --> 01:19:03.971
But I can drop you
at the hotel

01:19:03.973 --> 01:19:06.373
and then I'll meet you
at the airport in the morning.

01:19:06.375 --> 01:19:08.976
I'm not coming, Robert.

01:19:08.978 --> 01:19:11.011
What, you don't
need a ride?

01:19:11.013 --> 01:19:12.847
No, I mean, I'm not coming
to New York.

01:19:12.849 --> 01:19:16.517
I've thought about it a lot,
and I need to...

01:19:16.519 --> 01:19:19.954
I need to have my own career,
Robert.

01:19:21.357 --> 01:19:23.991
So I'm heading down
to Los Angeles.

01:19:26.496 --> 01:19:28.095
All right, what?

01:19:29.766 --> 01:19:32.032
You're my assistant.
That's your career.

01:19:33.436 --> 01:19:35.503
You owe me.
I gave you a life.

01:19:35.505 --> 01:19:37.071
No, I don't owe you.

01:19:37.073 --> 01:19:38.939
I've given you
everything I have.

01:19:38.941 --> 01:19:40.542
- Oh, well thank you.
- Robert, I have this much.

01:19:40.543 --> 01:19:42.943
This much.

01:19:42.945 --> 01:19:44.812
I need to start
my own life

01:19:44.814 --> 01:19:46.180
as Edward Maxey.

01:19:46.182 --> 01:19:48.149
- Yeah.
- Hmm?

01:19:48.151 --> 01:19:50.518
- Edward Maxey.
- Well, good luck with that.

01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:52.453
Whatever delusions
of grandeur you have,

01:19:52.455 --> 01:19:55.422
you're an assistant.

01:19:56.793 --> 01:19:58.092
Get in the car.

01:20:33.262 --> 01:20:35.362
Come here.

01:20:45.408 --> 01:20:49.376
I've had three great loves
in my life.

01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:52.580
My mom.

01:20:53.850 --> 01:20:55.282
Art.

01:20:57.353 --> 01:20:59.019
And you.

01:21:04.861 --> 01:21:06.227
I hope not in that order.

01:21:21.410 --> 01:21:23.310
And now for your update

01:21:23.312 --> 01:21:25.279
on Things About Town.

01:21:25.281 --> 01:21:28.048
Mapplethorpe Mania
has arrived in New York

01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:31.518
in the form of a retrospective
exhibition that opens July 28th

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:33.954
at the Whitney Museum
of American Art.

01:21:33.956 --> 01:21:35.489
Oh.

01:21:37.894 --> 01:21:39.627
Bravo, Martin.

01:21:39.629 --> 01:21:44.365
These are the deepest blacks
I have ever seen.

01:21:44.367 --> 01:21:46.433
Someone came by yesterday

01:21:46.435 --> 01:21:48.335
and they thought these two
were paintings.

01:21:48.337 --> 01:21:50.037
I know.
Well, that's the idea.

01:21:50.039 --> 01:21:51.906
And your canvas
seals the deal.

01:21:51.908 --> 01:21:53.540
You're going to be famous
for this.

01:21:53.542 --> 01:21:56.343
They are the holy grail
of platinum printing.

01:21:56.345 --> 01:22:00.581
Now, let's wrap
Thomas and Dovanna

01:22:00.583 --> 01:22:03.250
in white silk.

01:22:03.252 --> 01:22:04.652
Regal, you know?

01:22:04.654 --> 01:22:06.921
So everybody
knows to worship.

01:22:06.923 --> 01:22:12.526
And let's wrap Donald
in rich red silk.

01:22:14.931 --> 01:22:16.630
And we got to have a cock
in the show.

01:22:16.632 --> 01:22:20.334
I mean, people will be expecting
some cock.

01:22:26.976 --> 01:22:29.476
Thank you.
Thank you, Martin.

01:22:29.478 --> 01:22:31.979
Amazing work.
I mean, look.

01:22:33.416 --> 01:22:35.349
Can you make your legs into a V?

01:22:39.989 --> 01:22:41.588
Yeah. Hold that.

01:22:41.590 --> 01:22:44.091
Okay, could you just
dip your neck.

01:22:45.227 --> 01:22:46.560
Hold.

01:22:47.697 --> 01:22:50.464
Maybe try putting your arms

01:22:50.466 --> 01:22:53.233
straight out
in front of you.

01:22:53.235 --> 01:22:54.601
Perfect. Hold that.

01:22:57.373 --> 01:22:59.540
Ha! It's my baby brother.

01:22:59.542 --> 01:23:02.309
We're just photographing
this beautiful bronze sculpture.

01:23:02.311 --> 01:23:04.345
Robert, I thought
about what you said.

01:23:04.347 --> 01:23:06.180
Oh, Edward, meet Javier.

01:23:06.182 --> 01:23:07.748
He's my new assistant.

01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:09.717
He was just a Spanish
street urchin,

01:23:09.719 --> 01:23:12.186
but he's very ambitious,
and he's learning fast.

01:23:12.188 --> 01:23:14.321
- Hi.
- Mucho gusto.

01:23:14.323 --> 01:23:16.357
Oh, yeah, he doesn't speak
much English.

01:23:16.359 --> 01:23:18.092
But he's got a dictionary,

01:23:18.094 --> 01:23:19.761
so it shouldn't take you long
to train him.

01:23:19.762 --> 01:23:21.662
You know what, Ken?
Let's...

01:23:21.664 --> 01:23:24.665
Can I photograph you
by the dining room, please?

01:24:00.136 --> 01:24:02.169
Okay, can you make sure
you put this

01:24:02.171 --> 01:24:04.071
with the whole
Wasting series.

01:24:08.210 --> 01:24:10.377
It'll be valuable
when I'm gone.

01:24:41.577 --> 01:24:43.510
Oh, my...

01:24:43.512 --> 01:24:45.112
Father Stack.

01:24:46.215 --> 01:24:47.714
Robert.

01:24:47.716 --> 01:24:49.583
You're a long way
from Floral Park.

01:24:49.585 --> 01:24:51.185
I'm glad to see you.

01:24:53.155 --> 01:24:55.189
Do they speak to you?

01:24:57.293 --> 01:24:59.326
Well...

01:24:59.328 --> 01:25:02.696
it's a battle between
good and evil.

01:25:02.698 --> 01:25:06.400
Are you here for my confession,
Father?

01:25:06.402 --> 01:25:08.302
No.

01:25:08.304 --> 01:25:10.337
Your mother
asked me to come.

01:25:10.339 --> 01:25:12.272
She's worried about you.

01:25:12.274 --> 01:25:13.574
How is she?

01:25:14.777 --> 01:25:16.844
Not very well.

01:25:16.846 --> 01:25:19.613
Her emphysema
has really worsened.

01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:23.317
Sit down. Please.

01:25:28.891 --> 01:25:30.624
Robert...

01:25:32.428 --> 01:25:34.761
do you believe in God?

01:25:34.763 --> 01:25:36.396
No.

01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:39.633
What gives you solace?

01:25:41.770 --> 01:25:43.370
Beauty.

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:46.907
Perfection.

01:25:46.909 --> 01:25:49.910
Knowing that I've captured
those things in my work.

01:25:52.481 --> 01:25:55.349
Knowing that my work
will outlive me.

01:25:55.351 --> 01:25:58.752
It'll still be there
when I'm gone.

01:26:02.525 --> 01:26:04.825
And you have...

01:26:06.362 --> 01:26:07.728
Thank you.

01:26:10.266 --> 01:26:12.232
That's what I see.

01:26:12.234 --> 01:26:14.902
Even that which we deem obscene,

01:26:14.904 --> 01:26:18.605
you make look more beautiful
than I thought possible.

01:26:20.342 --> 01:26:23.510
I wonder what it's like
to be your subject.

01:26:23.512 --> 01:26:25.245
My subject?

01:26:29.919 --> 01:26:31.852
I remember my first
communion with you.

01:26:31.854 --> 01:26:33.820
- Can you remember that?
- I remember that.

01:26:33.822 --> 01:26:35.856
- Yes.
- Oh, perfect.

01:26:35.858 --> 01:26:37.925
- Thank you, Father.
- You're a rascal.

01:26:37.927 --> 01:26:39.660
I remember that.

01:26:39.662 --> 01:26:41.962
Did I blink? Sorry.

01:26:41.964 --> 01:26:44.731
Oh, you look absolutely
heavenly, Father.

01:26:44.733 --> 01:26:47.267
And if you could just
look off to my left, please.

01:26:47.269 --> 01:26:48.735
Just a touch.

01:26:48.737 --> 01:26:50.404
The devil is in all of us,
Father.

01:26:50.406 --> 01:26:52.306
I wonder where he is in you.

01:26:54.877 --> 01:26:57.211
I think we got it.

01:27:01.850 --> 01:27:03.817
Robert! I love you!

01:27:12.294 --> 01:27:13.994
Thank you
for coming.

01:27:25.407 --> 01:27:28.809
The first time I came
to this museum,

01:27:28.811 --> 01:27:32.446
they wouldn't let me in
because I didn't have a buck.

01:27:32.448 --> 01:27:35.749
But I always remember
these lights.

01:27:35.751 --> 01:27:37.384
- Robert.
- Hello.

01:27:37.386 --> 01:27:38.952
I'm curating
the ICA exhibition,

01:27:38.954 --> 01:27:41.421
and I wanted
to follow up with you

01:27:41.423 --> 01:27:43.557
on my idea of a traveling
exhibition of your work.

01:27:43.559 --> 01:27:45.392
- Oh.
- So, the entire range

01:27:45.394 --> 01:27:48.395
of your work would
be represented at once.

01:27:48.397 --> 01:27:50.631
Finally.

01:27:50.633 --> 01:27:52.666
From your most
hard-core imagery,

01:27:52.668 --> 01:27:54.301
to the most delicate flowers.

01:27:54.303 --> 01:27:55.736
They are delicate,
but not sweet.

01:27:55.738 --> 01:27:57.704
They're New York flowers.

01:28:00.276 --> 01:28:02.342
They have a black edge to them.

01:28:03.579 --> 01:28:05.045
So we'll open
in Philadelphia,

01:28:05.047 --> 01:28:06.913
and then it'll be Chicago,

01:28:06.915 --> 01:28:09.316
Washington, D.C.,
and finally, Cincinnati.

01:28:09.318 --> 01:28:12.319
Cincinnati.
Poor Cincinnati.

01:28:12.321 --> 01:28:15.722
Impossible to spell,
and starts with the word "Cin."

01:28:17.593 --> 01:28:19.993
Well, that sounds, yeah,
very interesting.

01:28:19.995 --> 01:28:21.762
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:28:21.764 --> 01:28:23.497
- I'll be in touch with you.
- All right.

01:28:26.702 --> 01:28:28.068
Have I met her?

01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:30.337
Hmm.

01:28:30.339 --> 01:28:31.738
Thought so.

01:28:33.809 --> 01:28:37.711
Oh, what I would give
for a hot dog.

01:28:37.713 --> 01:28:39.780
Oh, Robert, I don't know
if that's a good idea.

01:28:39.782 --> 01:28:41.548
Come on.
Like the old days.

01:28:41.550 --> 01:28:43.070
You haven't eaten solid food
in months.

01:28:49.091 --> 01:28:51.625
Roman, would you mind
stopping the car, please?

01:28:51.627 --> 01:28:53.894
No. Yeah, I got it.

01:28:53.896 --> 01:28:55.529
I'm all right.

01:28:56.532 --> 01:28:58.465
It's all right.

01:28:58.467 --> 01:28:59.800
I'm all right.
I'm all right.

01:28:59.802 --> 01:29:01.501
You got it?

01:29:05.774 --> 01:29:06.973
- Got it?
- I got it.

01:29:06.975 --> 01:29:08.508
Okay.

01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:10.644
Do you got it?

01:29:12.848 --> 01:29:14.681
I'm all right.
I'm all right.

01:29:16.051 --> 01:29:17.484
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

01:29:17.486 --> 01:29:18.952
- All right.
- Thanks.

01:29:38.707 --> 01:29:40.440
Hot dog.

01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:46.146
- You got it?
- Yeah.

01:29:50.018 --> 01:29:51.485
Mm.

01:29:51.487 --> 01:29:52.953
Don't crash

01:30:00.462 --> 01:30:01.895
So good.

01:30:33.829 --> 01:30:35.128
Hey, Angel.

01:30:36.765 --> 01:30:38.598
Hey.

01:30:41.937 --> 01:30:44.171
Come on, Soakie.

01:30:44.173 --> 01:30:47.207
It's okay.
It's going to be okay.

01:30:49.044 --> 01:30:50.811
What is that?

01:30:52.648 --> 01:30:55.482
It appeared when my son
was born.

01:30:55.484 --> 01:30:58.084
Oh.

01:30:58.086 --> 01:31:00.654
You're getting old.

01:31:00.656 --> 01:31:04.124
I told my parents,
remember, we...

01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:07.027
we got married in a...

01:31:08.530 --> 01:31:10.864
in a strawberry field
in California.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.934
- And we were.
- Yeah.

01:31:15.871 --> 01:31:18.472
Anything you dreamed
was real.

01:31:52.274 --> 01:31:54.040
Oh.

01:31:54.042 --> 01:31:55.809
Those are ugly.

01:31:55.811 --> 01:31:57.644
You can toss them.

01:31:57.646 --> 01:31:59.746
Don't you want to know
who they're from first?

01:31:59.748 --> 01:32:01.248
Not really.

01:32:02.518 --> 01:32:05.185
Okay, it says...

01:32:05.187 --> 01:32:07.053
I thought Mom was sick? No?

01:32:07.055 --> 01:32:08.655
She is.

01:32:08.657 --> 01:32:10.257
What, do you think Dad
sent these?

01:32:10.259 --> 01:32:11.791
He must have.

01:32:11.793 --> 01:32:13.660
Want to keep them?

01:32:13.662 --> 01:32:16.263
Yeah. It's like the nicest thing
he's ever done for me.

01:32:19.201 --> 01:32:20.934
Thank you.

01:32:26.608 --> 01:32:30.210
Who knew Dad had such
terrible taste in flowers?

01:32:31.613 --> 01:32:32.913
Right?

01:32:35.617 --> 01:32:37.217
Where do you want them?

01:32:37.219 --> 01:32:39.219
Sorry for the mix-up.

01:32:39.221 --> 01:32:42.088
The flowers are for the patient
across the hall.

01:32:42.090 --> 01:32:43.757
I'm sorry.

01:33:12.621 --> 01:33:15.789
Hey. Hey.

01:33:28.604 --> 01:33:30.971
Edward, I'm scared.

01:33:30.973 --> 01:33:32.839
I know.

01:33:38.981 --> 01:33:41.281
How was the show?

01:33:42.751 --> 01:33:44.684
It was good.

01:33:44.686 --> 01:33:47.253
Did you sell anything?

01:33:47.255 --> 01:33:49.723
A few.

01:33:49.725 --> 01:33:51.324
See?

01:33:51.326 --> 01:33:53.326
Told you, you don't need
to be a Mapplethorpe.

01:33:55.864 --> 01:33:58.131
You can make it on your own,
right?

01:33:58.133 --> 01:34:00.033
Sure.

01:34:00.035 --> 01:34:02.235
Can I see your work?

01:34:02.237 --> 01:34:04.371
Okay. All right.

01:34:06.308 --> 01:34:07.941
I think...

01:34:09.177 --> 01:34:12.812
you'll really
appreciate this.

01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:50.950
Sammy.

01:34:51.953 --> 01:34:54.020
Sam.

01:35:29.391 --> 01:35:30.857
