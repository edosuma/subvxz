WEBVTT

00:48.173 --> 00:50.129
Joe: Don't tell me
about my visa.

00:50.259 --> 00:51.840
My wife is stuck
in that hellhole,

00:51.927 --> 00:53.588
and I am getting on that plane.

01:00.519 --> 01:01.804
Emily: It's bad, Joe.

01:02.187 --> 01:03.597
They're evacuating the villages.

01:03.689 --> 01:05.600
The roads are washed out.

01:05.691 --> 01:07.556
We're hearing gunfire now.

01:07.651 --> 01:08.766
Can you...

01:08.860 --> 01:10.270
Can you get to calamar?

01:11.738 --> 01:14.901
Can you get across the
border to Colombia?

01:15.742 --> 01:16.982
They're putting us on a bus.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.658
I don't know where
they're taking us.

01:21.164 --> 01:22.495
Joe?

01:23.333 --> 01:24.368
Joe?

01:24.960 --> 01:26.871
Emily? Em...

02:19.222 --> 02:22.760
Woman: Emily darrow
was not just a doctor

02:22.851 --> 02:24.887
and a credit to
the medical profession,

02:25.771 --> 02:29.355
she was a healer and a credit
to the human race.

02:30.651 --> 02:33.393
Those who knew her
were changed by her,

02:33.612 --> 02:35.603
inspired by her commitment

02:35.697 --> 02:38.734
to give literally
everything of herself,

02:38.825 --> 02:41.692
which is why we're
gathered here today

02:41.787 --> 02:44.779
to celebrate this unique life,

02:45.832 --> 02:49.745
not so much taken from us
as given to us.

02:51.088 --> 02:53.124
From her colleagues
at the university,

02:54.132 --> 02:57.875
to her young patients
here in Chicago memorial's

02:57.969 --> 02:59.755
pediatric oncology ward,

03:01.598 --> 03:03.134
she will be sorely missed.

03:05.769 --> 03:09.057
Joe: We're told in medical school that
the face of an emergency room doctor

03:09.147 --> 03:11.058
is the last thing
a lot of people will ever see.

03:12.609 --> 03:13.849
I tried to keep that in mind

03:13.944 --> 03:16.026
when I see those frightened
eyes staring out at me.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.146
But I don't know what Emily saw,

03:20.575 --> 03:22.657
what image she took with her.

03:22.744 --> 03:25.531
If there was a compassionate
face,

03:25.622 --> 03:27.487
or if she died
in a world of chaos.

03:28.792 --> 03:31.955
And that I don't know this
haunts me.

03:33.422 --> 03:35.162
Soldier: The divers saw
inside, senor.

03:35.757 --> 03:37.418
There's no one alive.

03:37.509 --> 03:40.421
Joe: Then where is she?
Where's her body?

03:40.512 --> 03:42.423
We are searching the
shoreline and jungle now,

03:42.514 --> 03:44.880
but the bus is under
ten feet of water.

03:44.975 --> 03:47.307
The river runs at 17
miles an hour, senor.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.680
There is nothing you can do.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.307
Por favor, go home.

03:53.316 --> 03:54.647
I'm not going anywhere.

03:56.319 --> 03:57.604
Not till this 1s over.

03:58.947 --> 04:00.938
I assure you, senor,

04:01.032 --> 04:02.032
it's over.

04:28.643 --> 04:31.289
Doctor 1: No vitals, no pulse. Doctor
2: Put him in er 3 on the left.

04:31.313 --> 04:33.645
What are you doing here? I was paged.
What do we have?

04:33.732 --> 04:35.501
Wasn't this morning your
wife's memorial service?

04:35.525 --> 04:37.061
There's nothing
I can do for her, okay,

04:37.152 --> 04:39.380
except keep anyone from joining her.
Now, what do we have?

04:39.404 --> 04:41.360
Six car pile-up, 11 injuries,

04:41.448 --> 04:43.301
four went over to county
and six are coming here.

04:43.325 --> 04:45.052
All right. Let's go.
Paramedic: Watch your back!

04:45.076 --> 04:46.596
All right. Stay with me.
How extensive?

04:46.620 --> 04:49.111
Third degree, 40%, maybe 50.
Tube him?

04:49.206 --> 04:50.821
Airway's crushed,
couldn't do a trach.

04:50.916 --> 04:52.076
Pronounce him.

04:52.167 --> 04:53.452
Nurse: Hit the windshield.

04:53.543 --> 04:55.124
All right,
that's a blowout fracture.

04:55.212 --> 04:57.203
Geta C.T., find out
what else he's got.

04:57.547 --> 05:00.004
What's this?
O.D. Attempted suicide.

05:01.426 --> 05:02.586
All right. Give her to Simon.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.596
I'm interested in people
who want to live tonight.

05:05.347 --> 05:07.633
Joe: What's her term?
She hit the steering wheel.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.134
How pregnant? Anybody know?

05:09.226 --> 05:10.841
She looks no more than
six months to me.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.624
Well, she's souring,
let's get it out.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.143
At six months?

05:14.231 --> 05:15.831
It might have a chance,
but not in there.

05:16.233 --> 05:17.233
Look at her color.

05:17.943 --> 05:19.023
It's still got a heartbeat.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.192
Let's get it out of there.

05:20.403 --> 05:21.563
This requires a consultation.

05:21.905 --> 05:24.265
Yeah, and let's order out for
pizza while we're at it. Move.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.780
There's a procedure in place

05:25.867 --> 05:27.357
for terminating
a pregnancy, Joe.

05:27.452 --> 05:28.638
I'm not terminating a pregnancy,

05:28.662 --> 05:29.697
I'm delivering a baby.

05:30.288 --> 05:31.619
Get prenatal down here, now!

05:41.675 --> 05:42.755
It was the right call.

05:43.468 --> 05:45.379
Delivering a technically
unviable fetus

05:45.470 --> 05:48.678
by cesarean section without consultation
or permission of the mother...

05:48.765 --> 05:51.006
Who was dead. Not officially.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.391
The baby's alive, Hugh.

05:56.147 --> 05:57.478
I'm concerned, Joe.

05:57.566 --> 05:58.897
So is the rest of the staff.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.065
You refused to treat
a suicide today.

06:01.820 --> 06:03.151
I passed her on to Simon.

06:03.238 --> 06:05.149
As though she were
unworthy of you.

06:07.826 --> 06:09.532
Can we discuss this tomorrow?

06:10.787 --> 06:12.368
Since Emily's death,

06:12.455 --> 06:13.975
you have been working
around the clock.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.702
Twenty-four hour shifts,
I'm told. Seven days a week.

06:17.586 --> 06:18.826
Think I'm losing my edge?

06:18.920 --> 06:20.523
Just the opposite.
It's getting too sharp.

06:20.547 --> 06:22.187
You're starting to
cut people around here.

06:23.008 --> 06:24.623
You need time off.

06:26.011 --> 06:27.126
You need to grieve.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.137
I need to grieve? Mmm-hmm.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.688
I am serious, Joe.

06:42.360 --> 06:43.520
Take that time off.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.457
Was it you who reported me?

07:02.088 --> 07:03.294
Passing on the suicide?

07:09.596 --> 07:10.881
How's she doing?

07:11.598 --> 07:13.930
She's waiting for a bed
on the psych ward.

07:50.261 --> 07:51.671
Why did you do this to me?

07:52.722 --> 07:54.007
Do what to you?

07:56.351 --> 07:57.591
Bring me back.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.055
Where were you going?

08:01.898 --> 08:02.978
Someplace better.

08:04.025 --> 08:06.732
Is that right?
I'll do it again, too.

08:08.238 --> 08:09.353
It's all I want now.

08:11.282 --> 08:13.147
Well, unfortunately,
your heart disagrees.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.697
It's waged quite
a battle tonight.

08:20.667 --> 08:21.873
No one knows my heart.

08:26.589 --> 08:27.989
Maybe that's why
it's still beating.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.216
To give somebody a chance to.

08:38.058 --> 08:39.515
Let me tell you about that

08:39.602 --> 08:41.183
better place you think
you're going to.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.930
You better be damn sure
it's there.

08:46.818 --> 08:49.480
Because as crappy as this
place is, it's all there is.

08:51.948 --> 08:55.031
So go ahead, be my guest.

08:56.411 --> 08:57.680
But when you
never wake up again,

08:57.704 --> 08:59.410
don't say I didn't warn you.

09:05.837 --> 09:06.837
Hi, father.

09:07.672 --> 09:08.832
Time for a rebuttal?

09:14.054 --> 09:17.763
"And on her footfall
in the rustle of leaves,

09:18.558 --> 09:19.889
"the whisper on the wind,

09:20.769 --> 09:23.511
"she speaks from a place
beyond mortal pain."

09:24.314 --> 09:26.350
Hey, look who's here. Joel

09:26.441 --> 09:28.272
hey, you. Nice timing.

09:28.359 --> 09:29.712
You're just in time
to finish a toast.

09:29.736 --> 09:30.896
Here, pour him a beer.

09:30.987 --> 09:33.194
Linda, can we have
another one, please?

09:33.281 --> 09:35.272
Hey, Joe, Rachel in heaven,
remember that poem?

09:35.366 --> 09:37.903
Third year lit class. Remember?

09:37.994 --> 09:40.076
Yeah. To Emily.

09:40.163 --> 09:41.994
To Emily. Emily.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.491
How are things at the hospital?

09:47.921 --> 09:49.957
You know, I don't why we
try so hard to save them

09:50.048 --> 09:52.039
if they've got such
a wonderful place to go.

09:52.133 --> 09:55.296
Like Rachel in heaven.

09:55.386 --> 09:57.672
Well, that's where Emily is.
You can bet on that.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.444
If anyone deserved to
go there, it was her.

09:59.474 --> 10:02.307
Hear, hear. She was the best of us.
The best of us.

10:02.393 --> 10:04.205
I don't know what the hell
she saw in you, though.

10:04.229 --> 10:06.349
Lord knows I've tried for
years to talk her out of it.

10:09.192 --> 10:10.398
She was the best of us.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.651
And I have no idea
what she saw in me.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.444
She saw the second-best of us.

10:15.532 --> 10:16.863
You guys were a great team.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.481
She was the heart,
you were the mind.

10:18.576 --> 10:20.282
Together you were unbeatable.

10:31.631 --> 10:32.746
Where are you, Joe?

10:35.635 --> 10:36.635
Nowhere.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.139
I'm gonna go.

10:40.223 --> 10:41.884
No, come on. You just got here.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.244
Please, stay.
Like you said, Eric,

10:43.268 --> 10:44.599
I'm a mind without a heart.

10:45.228 --> 10:47.219
Joe, come on. Joe, that's not...

10:47.313 --> 10:48.473
Don't leave, Joe.

10:50.692 --> 10:53.104
That is not what I meant.
I know you didn't.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.148
But you were right on, buddy.

10:57.115 --> 10:59.197
And I love you anyway.
All of you.

11:00.952 --> 11:02.158
Thank you for coming today.

11:04.122 --> 11:05.122
See ya.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.517
Hey, doc.

11:27.395 --> 11:28.976
Hey, Miriam.

11:29.063 --> 11:30.803
Sorry I missed the service.

11:30.899 --> 11:32.935
I didn't want to cough
all over everybody.

11:33.610 --> 11:35.817
Was it nice? I guess.

11:38.281 --> 11:39.396
I couldn't handle it.

11:40.575 --> 11:43.157
Well, then you're not going
to do too good with this.

11:44.245 --> 11:45.781
They needed somebody
to sign for it.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.512
I didn't want to leave
it out in the rain.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.574
It's a toy company in Texas.

11:51.961 --> 11:53.481
That'll teach her
to shop the Internet.

11:54.505 --> 11:55.620
Yeah, that'll teach her.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.291
You'd think a professor of law

11:59.385 --> 12:00.945
could be more precise
with her language.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.253
It's all right.
Have a good night.

12:06.601 --> 12:09.809
Hey, I saw through the kitchen
window big bird didn't eat again.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.136
Should he go back to the vet?

12:11.773 --> 12:13.980
The vet said big bird
will outlive us all.

12:32.752 --> 12:33.958
Hey, Joe, it's hal.

12:34.045 --> 12:36.502
I forgot to tell you we're
going to the whitewater trail.

12:36.589 --> 12:37.669
Eric: You got to come, Joe.

12:37.715 --> 12:39.193
Flora: Don't leave me alone
with these guys.

12:39.217 --> 12:41.424
Hal: I sent you a packet, okay.

12:41.511 --> 12:42.991
Eric: See you, buddy.
Flora: Love you.

12:43.721 --> 12:44.756
Sound good, big bird?

12:46.933 --> 12:49.265
I'm gonna go rafting
with my old college chums.

12:54.399 --> 12:55.399
Nice to see you, too.

13:41.070 --> 13:43.277
Joe: Why is that funny?

13:43.364 --> 13:45.480
Emily: I just don't
picture you with a beak.

13:46.242 --> 13:50.155
Joe: Then, just imagine soaring
around with me up there. Flying.

13:50.246 --> 13:52.658
Emily: If you do, you're
on your own. Why?

13:52.749 --> 13:54.410
Because eagles
eat bunny rabbits.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.207
I'm a vegetarian.
In your next life, too?

13:57.295 --> 13:59.502
Yes.

13:59.589 --> 14:01.191
You mean, if you've got
a chance to come back,

14:01.215 --> 14:02.535
you'd want to be
earthbound again?

14:04.218 --> 14:05.503
No.

14:05.595 --> 14:07.335
I'll fly around with you
up there.

14:11.684 --> 14:12.719
Yeah, but...

14:17.065 --> 14:18.521
How are we gonna...

14:19.067 --> 14:20.682
You know...

14:22.945 --> 14:24.606
We'll just have to do
enough of that

14:24.697 --> 14:27.905
in this lifetime to make
up for the next ten.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.831
Emily: I'm going
because I have to, Joe.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.338
Because it's who I am,
who we are.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.337
What we dedicated our lives to.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.134
For god sakes, Emily,
you're pregnant.

15:30.555 --> 15:33.262
We addressed this, Joe,
when we first met.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.720
That we'd pack our kids
on our backs if we had to.

15:36.894 --> 15:39.180
To show them what was important,
to teach them our values.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.934
It was naive, Emily,
all right? It was naive.

15:45.194 --> 15:46.525
Our values?

15:53.244 --> 15:54.450
I'm needed there, Joe.

15:55.746 --> 15:56.826
And I'm going...

15:59.667 --> 16:01.077
Whether you choose to or not.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.634
Charlie: So this thing
was a paperweight?

16:32.658 --> 16:33.658
Joe: Yes.

16:33.743 --> 16:35.623
It was a present I gave her
for Valentine's day.

16:36.537 --> 16:39.779
It's got to weigh half a pound and
it was squarely, I mean squarely

16:39.874 --> 16:41.830
on the bedside table
when I went to sleep.

16:42.919 --> 16:43.999
So, what are you saying?

16:46.380 --> 16:47.495
I don't know.

16:48.174 --> 16:49.664
Nothing I guess. Just that...

16:51.177 --> 16:52.792
Dragonflies were
sort of her thing.

16:52.887 --> 16:54.548
Like a personal totem.

16:55.556 --> 16:57.217
How Indians have buffalo heads,

16:57.308 --> 16:58.764
or tiger heads, or hawks.

16:58.851 --> 17:01.183
Hers was a dragonfly.

17:02.563 --> 17:04.269
She even had this
small birthmark

17:04.357 --> 17:06.117
on her shoulder that
kind of looked like one.

17:06.150 --> 17:08.266
She said her grandfather
had one, too,

17:08.861 --> 17:11.227
on his... on his butt.

17:12.573 --> 17:14.655
It's called familial hemangioma.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.817
I once skunked an entire
graduating class

17:17.912 --> 17:19.527
by putting it on a final exam.

17:22.666 --> 17:25.374
When she was alive, I had to
scour for anything I could find

17:25.461 --> 17:27.497
with a dragonfly on it
to buy her a present.

17:28.673 --> 17:29.673
Now...

17:30.466 --> 17:31.706
Now I see them everywhere.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.134
There was one...

17:35.221 --> 17:37.502
There was one bouncing against
my office window yesterday.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.173
A real one.

17:40.268 --> 17:41.633
Last night a package arrived.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.263
She bought over the
Internet a mobile,

17:43.354 --> 17:45.970
to put on the baby's
crib, of dragonflies.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.141
And then this thing last
night with the paperweight.

17:52.029 --> 17:53.109
You know what I think?

17:54.073 --> 17:56.780
I think you are literally going
buggy living in that house.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.741
Yeah, you should move.

17:59.829 --> 18:01.473
You're rummaging around
in an empty nursery,

18:01.497 --> 18:03.112
you're living with
a talking parrot

18:03.207 --> 18:04.447
who won't even speak to you.

18:04.542 --> 18:06.078
He never would.

18:06.168 --> 18:07.248
He never liked me.

18:08.212 --> 18:09.372
He only talked to Emily.

18:11.382 --> 18:14.102
She even taught it to announce her
arrival when she came in the door.

18:16.804 --> 18:19.511
Honey. Honey, I'm home.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.760
You ought to sell that thing, Joe.
Get rid of it.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.551
I'm stuck with it.

18:26.022 --> 18:27.683
I promised her
I'd keep it forever,

18:27.773 --> 18:29.751
and I'd put a provision
in my will that if anything

18:29.775 --> 18:32.232
ever happened to me, someone I
trusted would take care of it.

18:34.238 --> 18:35.238
Would you?

18:36.449 --> 18:37.985
Would you?

18:38.075 --> 18:40.407
Oh, no. It's your promise,
buddy. It's not mine.

18:43.998 --> 18:45.909
I need to live up to
my promises to her.

18:47.835 --> 18:49.200
That's one thing I need to do.

18:49.295 --> 18:50.580
Okay, fine.

18:54.216 --> 18:56.753
Just one, but I'm taking care
of that one myself starting...

18:58.387 --> 18:59.593
Today.

19:00.264 --> 19:01.845
Hi, Joe. Hugh.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.295
I was kind of hoping you'd take
our conversation seriously.

19:05.728 --> 19:07.559
I did. I convinced Joe

19:07.647 --> 19:09.847
to take a couple of months off
with all that's happened.

19:10.608 --> 19:11.643
Right, Joe?

19:11.734 --> 19:15.477
I promised Emily I'd look in on her kids
on the oncology ward while she was gone.

19:15.571 --> 19:16.571
I never did.

19:17.490 --> 19:18.850
I thought this might be
a good day.

19:19.700 --> 19:22.282
After six months? On oncology?

19:23.245 --> 19:24.389
I'm not sure how many are left,

19:24.413 --> 19:25.823
but if it's for Emily, fine.

19:30.294 --> 19:31.294
Asshole.

19:32.213 --> 19:33.293
You should get away, Joe.

19:34.298 --> 19:35.663
Isn't there someplace
you can go?

19:41.222 --> 19:43.178
Woman over pa:
Dr. bond to radiology, please.

19:43.265 --> 19:44.971
Dr. bond to radiology.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.914
Dr. ritz, report to second
floor nurse's station.

20:14.964 --> 20:17.455
Dr. ritz, report to second
floor nurse's station.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.440
Dr. mace, please call the O.R.

20:37.486 --> 20:39.522
Dr. mace, please call the O.R.

21:08.559 --> 21:09.799
Boy: Joe!

21:28.621 --> 21:29.621
Joe!

21:48.808 --> 21:50.048
Joe!

21:54.355 --> 21:55.561
Joe!

21:56.398 --> 21:57.763
Joe, can't you hear me?

21:58.609 --> 21:59.689
Joe!

22:00.402 --> 22:01.402
Joe!

22:08.160 --> 22:09.320
All right, hold cpr.

22:09.411 --> 22:11.139
Nurse: I'm getting nothing.
Doctor: Continue it.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.744
Shock him in 30.
Let me in there.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.743
Come on, Jeffrey, hang in there.
Keep it going.

22:14.834 --> 22:17.450
Clear! Still nothing.

22:17.545 --> 22:19.331
Charging to 60. Shock him!

22:19.421 --> 22:20.501
Clear!

22:22.258 --> 22:23.668
Nothing. Go again.

22:23.759 --> 22:25.420
He's not responding.
I said, again.

22:25.511 --> 22:26.511
There's no pulse at all.

22:26.595 --> 22:27.697
He's not coming back this time.

22:27.721 --> 22:29.006
Damn it! Do it again!

22:29.890 --> 22:30.890
Clear!

22:37.815 --> 22:39.021
He's gone.

23:06.719 --> 23:09.051
He's got a rhythm.
He's back! Jump on it!

23:09.263 --> 23:11.379
He's coming back!
Yes, Jeffrey, yes!

23:11.473 --> 23:13.885
Do you need to be here?
Put that O2 mask on.

23:13.976 --> 23:16.217
Clear the room, please.
Give me an E.K.G.

23:16.312 --> 23:17.893
Doctor, his hand is moving.

23:17.980 --> 23:19.207
Doctor: Don't let him
pull out that I.V.

23:19.231 --> 23:21.062
Jeffrey, can you hear me?

23:24.153 --> 23:25.473
I just came around,
what happened?

23:26.989 --> 23:28.445
They're stabilizing him.

23:28.532 --> 23:31.114
He flatlined, and then
his heart started again.

23:32.536 --> 23:33.742
That's our Jeffrey.

23:33.829 --> 23:35.932
His heart's stopped more times
than anyone in the history

23:35.956 --> 23:37.366
of medical science, I think.

23:38.334 --> 23:39.978
He'll come out of there
with all kinds of stories

23:40.002 --> 23:42.038
about who he met in the
tunnel and what they said.

23:59.063 --> 24:01.054
Hi, I'm Dr. darrow
from emergency.

24:01.148 --> 24:02.888
I know who you are.

24:02.983 --> 24:05.725
The hospital administrator
heard that you got in the way

24:05.819 --> 24:07.275
in icu yesterday

24:07.363 --> 24:10.571
and asked to be notified
if you came back here again.

24:11.367 --> 24:13.733
The boy who was being
resuscitated last night...

24:14.912 --> 24:16.322
Jeffrey... reardon.

24:17.331 --> 24:19.697
Right. Is he still on the floor?

24:19.792 --> 24:22.499
Mmm-hmm. He was one
of your wife's favorites.

24:24.088 --> 24:26.688
Actually, that's why I'm here. I
promised I'd look in on her kids,

24:26.715 --> 24:28.956
but there don't
seem to be many left.

24:33.555 --> 24:35.450
It would be great if you could
give me a little help,

24:35.474 --> 24:39.308
maybe not put in that call
to the hospital administrator.

24:41.397 --> 24:43.103
Between you and me, doctor,

24:43.190 --> 24:46.682
the hospital administrator is...
How do I put it?

24:47.903 --> 24:49.143
I use the word asshole.

24:51.323 --> 24:52.733
That about captures it.

24:54.493 --> 24:55.949
315.

24:56.036 --> 24:58.368
He's a real trip.
You'll love him.

24:58.455 --> 24:59.615
Thanks.

25:09.591 --> 25:10.922
Hello. Hi.

25:12.177 --> 25:13.792
How's he doing? Great.

25:17.558 --> 25:19.219
Nice. What is it?

25:21.145 --> 25:23.010
I couldn't say. Guess.

25:25.107 --> 25:26.107
All right.

25:29.236 --> 25:30.646
Crucifix made of jell-o.

25:32.865 --> 25:35.402
Man, you're good. He's good.

25:35.492 --> 25:38.052
He hasn't stopped drawing them
since he got out of icu yesterday.

25:42.207 --> 25:43.697
So what is it?

25:43.792 --> 25:45.874
I don't know.
That's why I'm asking.

25:46.795 --> 25:48.075
I just woke up
thinking about it.

25:48.839 --> 25:51.000
I happened to be in the
icu yesterday, Jeffery.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.415
I know. I saw you in there.

25:54.136 --> 25:55.296
You saw me in there?

25:56.263 --> 25:59.300
Yeah. You came in through the back
of the room standing over my bed.

26:04.313 --> 26:05.678
You saw me
come over to your bed?

26:06.815 --> 26:08.521
Pretty sure it was you.

26:08.609 --> 26:09.649
But the tie was different.

26:09.735 --> 26:10.815
Jeffrey...

26:12.821 --> 26:14.482
Could I ask...

26:14.573 --> 26:16.780
We're not encouraged
to discuss these things.

26:17.951 --> 26:20.067
There was a nun on the ward
interviewing kids

26:20.162 --> 26:21.823
who had near-death experiences.

26:21.914 --> 26:24.451
Sister Madeline
from chaplain services.

26:25.125 --> 26:26.895
Stirred up all kinds of
trouble for the hospital

26:26.919 --> 26:29.285
when some of it appeared
on a TV tabloid show.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.412
She never even talked to me.

26:31.507 --> 26:33.964
And I've got the best near-death
experiences of anyone.

26:36.220 --> 26:39.178
I'm allowed a coffee break
if there's a doctor with him.

26:40.390 --> 26:43.177
In spite of hospital policy, I think
they need to talk to about it.

26:45.896 --> 26:47.602
You're scheduled for
a cat scan, Jeffery.

26:47.689 --> 26:48.689
Don't go without me.

26:59.409 --> 27:01.650
So what are we talking
about here, Jeffrey?

27:01.745 --> 27:02.905
What we shouldn't.

27:05.207 --> 27:07.744
In the icu yesterday,
when I approached your bed,

27:09.169 --> 27:11.535
it seemed to me you were pretty...
I was flatlined.

27:12.214 --> 27:13.454
Exactly.

27:14.258 --> 27:16.214
So how could you
look up and see me?

27:16.301 --> 27:17.586
I couldn't.

27:18.011 --> 27:19.467
But you said... l looked down.

27:21.140 --> 27:22.755
You looked down?

27:22.850 --> 27:24.135
From the ceiling.

27:24.226 --> 27:25.546
That's where I was
when I saw you.

27:31.483 --> 27:32.723
Okay.

27:34.153 --> 27:35.359
You don't believe me?

27:36.238 --> 27:37.569
Should I?

27:38.532 --> 27:40.614
Ever see that little bald spot
on top of your head?

27:44.079 --> 27:45.785
Bend down here.

27:45.873 --> 27:46.953
Come on, bend down here.

27:49.710 --> 27:52.201
Yeah, that was you.

27:56.008 --> 27:57.498
Jeffrey, do you know my name?

27:59.136 --> 28:00.342
You look like...

28:01.638 --> 28:02.844
A William to me.

28:03.974 --> 28:05.555
I'm a Joe.

28:05.642 --> 28:06.642
Does it ring a bell?

28:10.105 --> 28:11.105
Emily's Joe?

28:14.318 --> 28:15.649
Joe darrow.

28:18.822 --> 28:20.278
I saw her yesterday, too.

28:21.617 --> 28:23.357
What do you mean, Jeffery,
you saw her?

28:25.078 --> 28:26.443
She was there.

28:28.207 --> 28:29.367
Where?

28:30.626 --> 28:31.626
All around me.

28:34.963 --> 28:36.373
Inside the rainbow.

28:37.799 --> 28:38.799
The mist.

28:39.801 --> 28:41.007
I was falling.

28:41.678 --> 28:42.758
Falling through it

28:44.806 --> 28:46.091
until she caught me

28:47.059 --> 28:48.720
and brought me back up.

28:50.604 --> 28:51.764
She kind of flew me.

28:53.065 --> 28:54.430
She flew me out

28:57.861 --> 28:59.101
so I could come back

29:01.615 --> 29:03.105
and tell somebody something.

29:04.368 --> 29:05.483
Tell what, Jeffrey?

29:07.329 --> 29:08.694
To who?

29:11.500 --> 29:12.831
Joe.

29:15.128 --> 29:16.834
Tell me what, Jeffery?

29:18.924 --> 29:20.039
Tell Joe what?

29:22.511 --> 29:24.001
It was loud in the rainbow,

29:25.013 --> 29:26.219
like thunder in there.

29:27.224 --> 29:28.430
Tell me what, Jeffery?

29:29.643 --> 29:30.849
I don't know.

29:31.478 --> 29:32.763
You were calling my name.

29:33.981 --> 29:34.981
Joe.

29:36.817 --> 29:37.932
Joe.

29:39.319 --> 29:40.900
Joe, can't you hear me?

29:42.072 --> 29:43.403
Joe! All right.

29:44.032 --> 29:45.738
Joe! Joel Jeffrey.

29:45.826 --> 29:47.782
Slow down. Whoa.

29:48.245 --> 29:49.325
Whoa.

29:50.080 --> 29:52.321
Look at my eyes.
Look at my eyes.

29:53.208 --> 29:54.448
Just breathe.

29:55.210 --> 29:56.495
Just breathe a little bit, okay?

29:57.963 --> 29:58.998
What happened?

30:00.424 --> 30:02.335
I'm fine. We were...

30:02.426 --> 30:04.291
He wanted to know what
happened yesterday.

30:05.262 --> 30:07.423
His heart stopped again. I know.

30:08.557 --> 30:09.557
I was there, actually.

30:09.641 --> 30:12.883
He wanted to know what
happened while it was stopped.

30:12.978 --> 30:15.811
Oh. He's telling one of
his tall tales again,

30:15.897 --> 30:17.012
trying togeton TV.

30:17.691 --> 30:19.210
I'm gonna give him
a dust mop next time

30:19.234 --> 30:21.114
so he can sweep the ceiling
while he's up there.

30:21.987 --> 30:23.318
My daddy don't believe me.

30:24.573 --> 30:25.938
He do the bald spot on you?

30:32.205 --> 30:35.322
It don't work on everybody,
just us bald guys.

30:36.585 --> 30:37.950
Yeah, he got me
with that one, too.

30:41.590 --> 30:42.870
You had me going there, Jeffery.

30:43.633 --> 30:45.248
It was the truth.

30:45.344 --> 30:46.459
You don't believe me?

30:52.100 --> 30:54.933
What if I do remember
what she wants to tell you?

30:56.355 --> 30:57.515
Then would you believe me?

30:58.523 --> 30:59.729
Do you remember it?

31:00.817 --> 31:02.523
If you come back I might.

31:02.611 --> 31:04.491
Jeffrey's father: Of what
who wants to tell him?

31:04.571 --> 31:06.152
Jeffrey: His wife.

31:06.239 --> 31:07.729
She wants me
to tell him something.

31:09.076 --> 31:11.738
Probably take out the trash.

31:56.790 --> 32:00.282
He even had me believing he saw
my bald spot from the ceiling,

32:00.377 --> 32:02.288
until I saw a mirror
behind my head.

32:02.379 --> 32:04.961
Neil: We can thank mom for
those genes. Right, dad?

32:05.048 --> 32:07.928
I hate to burst your bubble, Joe, but
I can see your bald spot from here.

32:09.386 --> 32:10.592
I think bald is sexy.

32:11.513 --> 32:12.844
Really? Yes.

32:12.931 --> 32:14.451
I have a parrot that
might turn you on.

32:15.475 --> 32:17.716
Are you still living with
that messy thing, Joe?

32:18.562 --> 32:21.053
We're working on our relationship.
Is it a talking parrot?

32:22.399 --> 32:24.105
A listening parrot.

32:24.192 --> 32:25.602
A bird after my own heart.

32:25.694 --> 32:27.184
That's what I do for a living.

32:27.279 --> 32:28.564
Listen. Really?

32:29.781 --> 32:31.737
Gwyn's a grief counselor, Joe.

32:31.825 --> 32:34.385
That's why I thought it might be
a good idea for you two to meet.

32:38.081 --> 32:39.161
Is that right?

32:40.167 --> 32:41.853
In fact, I've heard
a lot of clients talk about

32:41.877 --> 32:43.868
the near-death experiences
of their loved ones.

32:43.962 --> 32:46.578
How they wake up talking about
being in a dark tunnel,

32:46.673 --> 32:47.753
moving toward the light.

32:48.633 --> 32:49.748
What's your thought on it?

32:51.011 --> 32:52.751
I'm just your parrot, Joe.

32:52.846 --> 32:54.006
Just listening.

32:55.348 --> 32:57.508
I can tell you as an eye
surgeon, it's all very simple.

32:58.101 --> 32:59.501
The tunnel is literal
tunnel vision.

33:00.479 --> 33:03.199
And the white light is the gradual
bleaching-out of the optic screen.

33:03.273 --> 33:05.710
As it grows bigger, it would seem
like you are moving toward it.

33:05.734 --> 33:07.770
How do you explain
their ability to recall

33:07.861 --> 33:09.421
what everyone said
around their deathbed

33:09.446 --> 33:10.936
after they were declared dead?

33:11.031 --> 33:13.113
To describe what the
doctors were wearing

33:13.200 --> 33:15.065
down to the patterns
on their ties?

33:15.911 --> 33:17.431
Phillip: It's the way
we measure death.

33:18.079 --> 33:21.697
Obviously the brain is still
functioning on some subliminal level,

33:22.459 --> 33:25.326
soaking up all the last bits of
what's left to hear and see.

33:26.838 --> 33:29.150
That's what you get for having
dinner with a family of doctors.

33:29.174 --> 33:31.174
No discussion about floating
around on the ceiling.

33:31.259 --> 33:33.295
No tunnel, no bright lights.

33:33.386 --> 33:35.626
Next thing they're gonna tell
us, there's no tooth fairy.

33:39.601 --> 33:42.092
Funny thing is, I thought I
heard him calling out for me.

33:43.438 --> 33:44.598
This kid.

33:45.148 --> 33:46.263
I heard his voice

33:47.150 --> 33:48.150
calling, "Joe."

33:49.152 --> 33:52.610
When I introduced myself to him,
he asked me if I was Emily's Joe.

33:54.908 --> 33:57.024
He said that Emily
was trying to reach me.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.839
Do you believe she's
trying to reach you, Joe?

34:05.627 --> 34:07.913
No, counselor, I don't.

34:12.926 --> 34:14.462
I can give you an hour for free.

34:19.808 --> 34:21.014
Bye, Joe.

34:21.101 --> 34:22.762
You want me to package
up dessert for you?

34:22.851 --> 34:24.433
Sorry. Use your phone?

34:31.777 --> 34:32.813
Excuse me.

34:39.953 --> 34:41.614
I am kind of busy
at the moment, yeah.

34:43.706 --> 34:46.027
Well, isn't there anyone else
who can cover for me tonight?

34:46.835 --> 34:48.554
All right, I understand.
I'll be right over.

34:52.424 --> 34:53.960
I'm sorry.
I'd really like to stay...

34:54.050 --> 34:56.041
No, you wouldn't.
It's too threatening.

34:56.928 --> 34:58.418
It's about unresolved issues

34:58.513 --> 34:59.873
you're not ready
to deal with, yet.

35:00.849 --> 35:03.181
Guilt, anger toward
our loved ones.

35:03.810 --> 35:05.892
That's why
we conjure up spirits,

35:05.979 --> 35:07.844
from the virgin Mary
to our dearly departed,

35:07.939 --> 35:09.895
because we need to talk to them,

35:09.983 --> 35:12.520
not the other way around.

35:18.867 --> 35:20.949
You asked if I thought she
was trying to contact me

35:21.036 --> 35:23.493
and I never answered.
Let me answer now.

35:24.414 --> 35:26.621
She was my ultimate partner,

35:26.708 --> 35:29.745
my best friend and lover,
and I miss her beyond belief.

35:30.879 --> 35:34.212
I also know I'm never going
to see her again,

35:34.299 --> 35:35.914
not ever.

35:36.009 --> 35:38.404
I'm just beginning to understand
what that means so intensely

35:38.428 --> 35:41.010
that I sometimes wish I didn't
have to wake up anymore.

35:41.973 --> 35:43.653
The last thing I need
is someone telling me

35:43.725 --> 35:45.590
what to feel or how to feel.

35:46.686 --> 35:48.677
Anger? Yeah.

35:48.772 --> 35:50.888
Guilt? You bet.

35:50.982 --> 35:52.847
But I don't need you
crawling up my ass

35:52.942 --> 35:55.183
with a flashlight
to tell me about it.

35:55.278 --> 35:57.360
Keep going, Joe.
This is what you need.

35:58.948 --> 36:00.268
I'll drop you a check
in the mail.

36:27.811 --> 36:28.811
Hi.

36:30.897 --> 36:31.897
Hey.

36:33.066 --> 36:34.272
What's your name?

36:34.693 --> 36:35.693
Ben.

36:36.444 --> 36:37.559
I'm Joe, Ben.

36:38.947 --> 36:39.947
I know.

36:43.535 --> 36:44.820
I was just admiring
your artwork.

36:45.954 --> 36:47.069
What is it?

36:48.707 --> 36:50.322
She said you should go there.

36:51.501 --> 36:52.707
I'm sorry?

36:53.795 --> 36:55.251
The lady.

36:55.338 --> 36:57.294
The lady in the picture
down the hall.

36:58.341 --> 37:01.003
She said you'd
be coming to see me.

37:04.139 --> 37:05.219
The nurse?

37:06.099 --> 37:08.260
They said she was a doctor here.

37:12.188 --> 37:13.268
What doctor?

37:15.024 --> 37:16.514
She wants you to go there.

37:17.652 --> 37:18.858
Go where?

37:29.456 --> 37:30.992
I'm not...

37:31.082 --> 37:32.572
I'm not sure what you mean, Ben.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.413
Go where?

37:36.296 --> 37:37.502
I dreamed of her.

37:38.423 --> 37:40.505
In the ambulance
when I came here.

37:41.760 --> 37:45.252
Then I saw her picture
in the hall.

37:46.848 --> 37:48.304
You know, the lady doctor

37:49.392 --> 37:51.007
in the picture
of the easter party

37:54.189 --> 37:55.850
are you talking about
Dr. darrow?

37:59.027 --> 38:00.267
She died, I guess.

38:04.574 --> 38:05.859
And you dreamed of her?

38:11.289 --> 38:12.745
She wants you to go there.

38:17.086 --> 38:18.496
Go where, Ben?

38:20.340 --> 38:21.500
The rainbow.

38:24.719 --> 38:25.834
That's a rainbow?

38:30.183 --> 38:31.298
This is a rainbow?

38:42.403 --> 38:43.768
Have we met before, Ben?

38:46.741 --> 38:47.776
I don't know.

38:50.578 --> 38:51.909
How do you know who I am?

38:54.624 --> 38:56.205
She showed me your face.

39:02.382 --> 39:03.963
A picture?

39:06.636 --> 39:07.876
In my mind.

39:09.806 --> 39:11.137
She said

39:11.933 --> 39:14.925
I have to come back
to tell you to go there.

39:19.274 --> 39:20.434
To arainbow?

39:24.696 --> 39:25.696
Yes.

39:29.659 --> 39:32.150
How would I...
How would I do that, Ben?

39:50.138 --> 39:52.504
Christine. The boy in 312.

39:52.599 --> 39:53.634
Ben? Yes.

39:53.725 --> 39:54.885
Did he know my wife?

39:56.185 --> 39:59.177
I don't think so. I think he
just came in two weeks ago.

39:59.856 --> 40:01.392
Yeah, on the third, in a coma.

40:01.482 --> 40:03.723
Septic shock. Why, Joe?

40:08.281 --> 40:09.281
Nothing.

40:11.326 --> 40:12.532
Joe: Miriam.

40:13.578 --> 40:15.660
The first kid, he calls my name.

40:15.747 --> 40:19.490
I follow him into the
icu, where he flatlines.

40:19.584 --> 40:20.824
Right? Dies.

40:20.919 --> 40:22.910
Then when he's resuscitated,
he says he saw me

40:23.004 --> 40:25.040
while he's floating
around the ceiling.

40:25.131 --> 40:27.463
And that Emily,
whom he met in a rainbow,

40:27.550 --> 40:29.836
sent him back
to tell me something.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.338
Tell you what?

40:32.388 --> 40:33.548
He doesn't remember.

40:34.515 --> 40:36.847
But the next kid does.
You want jelly?

40:36.935 --> 40:39.392
I got two kinds?
Are you taking me seriously?

40:39.479 --> 40:42.312
Yes. Is strawberry okay?
What does it matter?

40:42.398 --> 40:45.014
Do you hear
what I'm telling you?

40:45.109 --> 40:47.896
I'm just trying to focus
on something real here, Joe.

40:48.154 --> 40:49.985
And you think this isn't?

40:50.073 --> 40:51.358
Doesn't sound it, so far.

40:55.411 --> 40:56.617
Listen to me, Joe.

41:00.375 --> 41:03.913
After Hannah died,
I saw her everywhere.

41:05.421 --> 41:07.207
She told me I'd know
she was watching over me

41:07.298 --> 41:09.129
if I saw a Daisy growing
out of the ground

41:09.217 --> 41:10.957
with all the petals missing
except one.

41:11.636 --> 41:13.843
We used to play she-loves-me,
she-loves-me-not.

41:14.722 --> 41:18.806
And one day, I saw an entire
field of one-petal daisies.

41:19.769 --> 41:22.181
Well, there you go.
How do you explain that?

41:23.106 --> 41:24.767
I was delusional.

41:24.857 --> 41:25.892
Well, I'm not, okay?

41:26.693 --> 41:28.649
I had these conversations!

41:28.736 --> 41:30.943
Wait, aren't you the guy that
doesn't believe in heaven?

41:31.030 --> 41:33.271
This isn't heaven.
This is rainbows.

41:34.367 --> 41:35.652
On.

41:35.743 --> 41:39.076
And she wants you to join her
inside a rainbow?

41:40.581 --> 41:42.287
According to these kids,
that's accurate.

41:43.334 --> 41:45.416
Well, according to me,
they're putting you on.

41:46.337 --> 41:47.702
So you think they're lying?

41:47.797 --> 41:48.877
I'm a lawyer, Joe!

41:48.965 --> 41:50.546
Nothing is real
without evidence.

41:51.634 --> 41:55.593
Have you personally had any experience
with Emily since her death?

41:55.888 --> 41:57.344
And if so,
has it been documented?

41:58.057 --> 41:59.697
You know the answer.
Of course I haven't.

41:59.726 --> 42:00.726
And why haven't you?

42:00.810 --> 42:03.051
Because I haven't gone
halfway to heaven,

42:03.146 --> 42:05.228
and she has no way
of reaching me!

42:19.996 --> 42:21.702
It does sound nuts, doesn't it?

42:23.249 --> 42:25.661
Well, I wouldn't employ you in
my hospital if I heard that.

42:27.128 --> 42:28.868
And if I were you,
I'd stay away from there.

42:30.131 --> 42:31.871
Isn't there somewhere
you can go?

42:34.677 --> 42:36.258
I could go on a whitewater trip.

42:37.430 --> 42:39.295
Just what I've always
wanted to see...

42:41.142 --> 42:42.302
Whitewater.

42:42.393 --> 42:43.678
I'll take care of big bird.

42:44.145 --> 42:45.180
Get out of here.

42:46.355 --> 42:48.141
Go see whitewater.

42:48.608 --> 42:50.144
And get your head straight.

43:35.238 --> 43:36.569
Want to see?

43:40.076 --> 43:41.782
They were the last thing
she sent us.

43:59.345 --> 44:00.345
Hmm...

44:02.473 --> 44:04.634
Sorry to break it to you, pal,

44:07.061 --> 44:08.517
but she was cheating on you.

44:48.144 --> 44:49.759
It's just a bug, big bird.

44:51.647 --> 44:53.012
Attracted to the light.

44:54.817 --> 44:56.102
Let's not get crazy here.

45:37.693 --> 45:39.524
Big bird: Honey, I'm home.

45:44.242 --> 45:45.948
Honey, I'm home.

46:49.724 --> 46:50.724
Big bird!

46:56.856 --> 46:58.016
Big bird, no!

47:43.736 --> 47:44.771
Miriam: Hello?

47:44.862 --> 47:46.318
Joe: Miriam. Miriam: Joe?

47:46.405 --> 47:47.861
Miriam, listen to me.

47:47.948 --> 47:49.438
The bird, it's sick.

47:49.575 --> 47:52.487
I had to leave il. I'm on
my way to the hospital.

47:52.578 --> 47:53.693
Are you okay?

47:53.788 --> 47:55.619
Actually, I'm not.

47:55.706 --> 47:56.821
I feel...

47:59.126 --> 48:00.662
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

48:01.587 --> 48:02.622
What can I do?

48:03.339 --> 48:05.751
It was acting like it used to
when she'd come home.

48:07.218 --> 48:08.628
I felt like she was there.

48:09.970 --> 48:11.210
In the house.

48:12.139 --> 48:13.345
Jesus, Joe.

48:14.558 --> 48:16.094
I don't know what to do about...

48:16.185 --> 48:17.265
The bird?

48:17.853 --> 48:19.059
I'll take care of it.

48:19.688 --> 48:21.679
I'll wake up the vet
if I have to.

48:22.817 --> 48:24.808
You just hang in there.

48:24.902 --> 48:25.937
Okay?

48:26.028 --> 48:27.143
All right, thanks.

48:32.493 --> 48:33.528
Is Jeffrey awake?

48:33.619 --> 48:35.555
Oncology nurse: Not a good idea right now.
Is he in his room?

48:35.579 --> 48:38.412
Visiting hours aren't until
10:00, Joe.

48:38.499 --> 48:39.784
Joel!

48:42.503 --> 48:43.583
Joe.

48:54.640 --> 48:55.755
Joe,

48:55.850 --> 48:57.828
there was some talk around here
I think you should know about.

48:57.852 --> 48:58.852
Where is he?

48:59.645 --> 49:02.307
Jeffrey? He's downstairs
getting blood work, can I...

49:02.398 --> 49:03.763
His nurse, is she with him?

49:03.858 --> 49:05.210
Would you just listen
to me for a minute?

49:05.234 --> 49:06.849
She said there was a nun
on the ward

49:07.319 --> 49:09.526
interviewing kids
about near-death experiences.

49:10.030 --> 49:12.237
Sister Madeline.
Do you know where she is?

49:12.408 --> 49:14.023
She's no longer
employed here, Joe.

49:15.661 --> 49:16.741
And do you know why?

49:17.121 --> 49:18.486
Because she overstepped
her bounds.

49:19.415 --> 49:21.030
Where is she employed?

49:22.126 --> 49:23.991
Would chaplain services know?

49:24.086 --> 49:25.566
Could you leave us
alone for a minute?

49:33.762 --> 49:35.753
What are you doing, Joe?

49:35.848 --> 49:37.429
You know what I'm doing.

49:37.516 --> 49:38.785
All right. You gave
me permission.

49:38.809 --> 49:41.391
To look in on Emily's kids.
That was two days ago.

49:41.479 --> 49:42.873
And from what ll've heard,
you haven't left since.

49:42.897 --> 49:44.683
I told you. I promised
my wife...

49:44.773 --> 49:45.808
That you'd upset them?

49:46.734 --> 49:49.020
Jeffrey's cardiologist
saw the readout on his EKG

49:49.111 --> 49:51.773
from 2:30 yesterday afternoon
and he was damned upset

49:51.864 --> 49:54.651
that your visit put him
under that kind of stress.

49:55.451 --> 49:56.782
What is going on, Joe?

50:08.631 --> 50:10.371
He will outlive us all.

50:11.258 --> 50:13.123
I tried to clean up
some of the mess in there.

50:13.761 --> 50:15.672
Overturned lamp, broken vase.

50:16.931 --> 50:18.387
You didn't have to do all that.

50:18.766 --> 50:20.302
I didn't do "all that."

50:21.018 --> 50:23.725
I left some of it
to discuss with you.

50:28.067 --> 50:30.729
That weird picture you told
me the kids were drawing,

50:31.612 --> 50:33.022
the wiggly cross?

50:38.577 --> 50:39.862
Is it the kids drawing it, Joe

50:40.746 --> 50:42.282
oris it you?

50:46.919 --> 50:49.160
'Cause if you did this,
you need some help.

50:52.758 --> 50:54.214
It's all over the windows, too.

51:05.437 --> 51:06.722
Watch the bird for me, will you?

51:40.180 --> 51:41.260
Excuse me.

51:42.766 --> 51:44.506
Excuse me, I'm looking
for sister Madeline.

51:44.602 --> 51:46.718
Is that...
May I ask what this is about?

51:47.396 --> 51:48.681
It's personal. Is that her?

51:48.772 --> 51:50.732
You'll have to call the
office for an appointment.

51:51.400 --> 51:52.606
Excuse Mel sir.

51:52.985 --> 51:54.691
Sister Madeline! Sir!

51:54.778 --> 51:56.860
Sister Madeline, could
I speak to you?

51:57.114 --> 51:59.196
Sir! Please!

51:59.283 --> 52:00.648
Sister Madeline!

52:02.202 --> 52:03.612
Please, are you...

52:04.872 --> 52:07.284
Please, are you sister Madeline?

52:10.044 --> 52:12.456
I know. I tried to call.
I'm sorry. Chaplain...

52:12.546 --> 52:14.537
Chaplain services
only gave me an address.

52:14.673 --> 52:15.753
He'll call the police.

52:16.717 --> 52:19.504
Please. Just five minutes!

52:19.762 --> 52:21.548
You people have done
enough damage.

52:21.972 --> 52:24.679
You don't understand! You don't!

52:24.850 --> 52:27.262
No more journalists.
No more interviews.

52:27.603 --> 52:29.093
I'm not a journalist. I'm a...

52:29.855 --> 52:30.855
I'm a doctor.

52:32.066 --> 52:33.101
Head of...

52:33.192 --> 52:36.605
I'm head of emergency services
at Chicago memorial hospital.

52:37.446 --> 52:38.446
Joe darrow.

52:41.784 --> 52:44.321
Emily's Joe? Yes.

52:48.082 --> 52:49.882
That's why
I need to talk to you.

52:49.958 --> 52:52.244
I need to know about your work.

52:54.672 --> 52:57.004
I've called the police.
I'd advise you to leave.

52:57.091 --> 52:59.002
It's all right.
He's not a journalist.

52:59.093 --> 53:00.458
He's still trespassing.

53:00.552 --> 53:03.419
I'm sorry. We agreed to
hire sister Madeline

53:03.514 --> 53:05.241
with the understanding
that her presence here

53:05.265 --> 53:06.545
wouldn't cause any disturbances.

53:07.476 --> 53:09.762
Sister.

53:17.945 --> 53:20.106
The police respond quickly.
I'd advise you to leave.

53:39.925 --> 53:41.836
Do you have business
at the school, sir?

53:42.928 --> 53:45.135
I beg your pardon?
Step over, please.

54:33.854 --> 54:36.311
Sister Madeline:
And I realized that in an age

54:36.398 --> 54:38.810
when no one believes
in miracles anymore,

54:38.901 --> 54:42.109
I was witnessing
miracles every day.

54:43.405 --> 54:45.691
And the pediatric oncology ward

54:45.783 --> 54:49.196
was the perfect laboratory
to study it,

54:49.286 --> 54:50.742
the near-death experience.

54:51.789 --> 54:56.158
Being kids, they were
more open to what happens

54:56.251 --> 54:57.286
on the other side.

54:58.712 --> 55:01.454
You're convinced it's not
just in their minds?

55:03.050 --> 55:04.586
Justin their minds?

55:06.970 --> 55:10.258
What we're experiencing right
now could be just in your mind.

55:12.267 --> 55:13.507
You're a doctor

55:13.602 --> 55:15.934
because you dreamed
of being one, right?

55:17.481 --> 55:21.895
You imagined that for yourself.

55:23.862 --> 55:26.023
If we can create this world

55:26.114 --> 55:28.901
with what we imagine,
why not the next?

55:30.911 --> 55:32.867
So you're saying belief...

55:32.955 --> 55:34.491
Gets us there.

55:35.916 --> 55:37.406
Did Emily believe?

55:39.670 --> 55:40.955
Because I think she got there.

55:42.798 --> 55:45.005
I believe she's
trying to contact me.

55:46.969 --> 55:49.381
Two kids have seen her.

55:49.471 --> 55:52.338
One was flatlined,
another in a coma.

55:52.891 --> 55:54.222
In the tunnel?

55:54.726 --> 55:55.966
In a rainbow,

55:56.895 --> 55:59.056
trying to tell me something,
something urgent.

56:00.315 --> 56:02.101
But I don't know what.

56:02.985 --> 56:04.850
And the, they...

56:05.279 --> 56:07.941
They draw this after they...

56:08.615 --> 56:09.946
After they've seen her.

56:10.534 --> 56:12.149
Have you ever seen this before?

56:13.745 --> 56:15.076
No.

56:25.841 --> 56:27.297
I don't know.

56:28.844 --> 56:30.550
Am...

56:31.221 --> 56:32.427
Am I just going nuts?

56:35.058 --> 56:37.640
As nuts as Christopher Columbus,

56:37.728 --> 56:40.265
thinking there was
another side to the earth.

56:43.525 --> 56:45.811
Talk to an anesthesiologist,
they'll tell you.

56:46.695 --> 56:49.903
There are a hundred steps
on the ladder of consciousness

56:49.990 --> 56:54.029
between being fully alert
and being dead.

56:55.370 --> 56:56.610
To put a patient under,

56:56.705 --> 56:59.868
they bring them down
only to the tenth rung.

57:01.126 --> 57:05.620
Beneath that is a
descending gray scale

57:05.714 --> 57:10.003
like the depths of an ocean
no one has explored.

57:11.470 --> 57:13.426
You see, in those depths,

57:13.513 --> 57:16.550
those murky depths,
she's finding them.

57:16.642 --> 57:18.178
The children.

57:18.268 --> 57:19.508
They're her conduit,

57:19.603 --> 57:21.059
because she knew

57:21.146 --> 57:23.353
you'd find your way to them.

57:25.025 --> 57:26.435
Stay close to them.

57:27.152 --> 57:29.063
Be with them
when they slip away,

57:29.154 --> 57:32.112
so you can be with them
when they first awaken,

57:32.199 --> 57:33.939
before the details fade.

57:35.786 --> 57:37.742
One of them

57:37.829 --> 57:40.821
will come back with the answer.

58:44.271 --> 58:46.853
Paramedic 1: Careful, careful.
Paramedic 2: Watch your back.

58:47.107 --> 58:48.438
Release form? I'll get it.

58:48.525 --> 58:49.640
Thank you. Thank you.

58:49.776 --> 58:51.858
We're taking him to 215.
Where is it?

58:51.945 --> 58:53.981
Paramedic 1: Down on the right.

58:54.281 --> 58:56.442
Keep it pumping. Right here.

58:56.575 --> 58:58.495
Hook him to the ventilator.
I'll get the monitor.

58:58.535 --> 59:01.415
This is Jeanette in nephrology, I need
to speak to Dr. Dickinson, please.

59:02.831 --> 59:05.243
Dr. darrow!
Yes, it is an emergency.

59:05.959 --> 59:07.745
No, I can't hold.
Keep me on the line.

59:08.795 --> 59:11.036
Dr. Dickinson, we've got
a healthy kidney up here.

59:11.631 --> 59:13.747
Just Dr. darrow. Joe.

59:15.635 --> 59:17.967
Yeah. Joe, I'm on my way
over to harvest a kidney

59:18.055 --> 59:19.841
and I want you to
protect it for me.

59:20.599 --> 59:21.599
Tell me what to do.

59:21.975 --> 59:25.138
All right, they're coming in for other
organs, but that kidney is mine.

59:25.520 --> 59:27.226
I want that made clear
in case anybody

59:27.314 --> 59:29.145
choppers in and tries
to grab it.

59:29.775 --> 59:30.815
Stay on top of his vitals.

59:30.859 --> 59:32.587
Don't leave the room,
and hold off the vultures.

59:32.611 --> 59:34.297
I don't want anybody cutting
until I get there.

59:34.321 --> 59:36.778
Consider it done. Put Jeanette
back on the phone, buddy.

59:36.865 --> 59:38.105
I'm ten minutes away.

59:38.200 --> 59:39.315
Jeanette.

59:40.535 --> 59:41.775
Yes, sir?

59:55.342 --> 59:57.583
Dr. Dickinson? Darrow.

59:58.762 --> 01:00:00.627
They told me not to leave him,

01:00:00.722 --> 01:00:02.882
but I've got to get this
monitor over to the recipient.

01:00:03.892 --> 01:00:05.223
I'll keep watch in here.

01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:07.972
Ventilator's set at 16.

01:00:08.063 --> 01:00:09.644
That ought to keep
the organs fresh.

01:01:23.305 --> 01:01:24.590
Patient: Joe.

01:01:33.148 --> 01:01:34.148
Joe.

01:01:56.213 --> 01:01:58.795
Emily: Come closer.

01:02:01.676 --> 01:02:02.676
Dear god.

01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:06.032
Man: We're from lakeview,
what room's the donor in?

01:02:06.056 --> 01:02:08.342
Woman: Room 215, first double
doors on your right.

01:02:08.433 --> 01:02:10.553
Man: Call air support and
tell them we'll be right up.

01:02:19.653 --> 01:02:20.893
We're from lakeview in Lansing.

01:02:20.946 --> 01:02:22.906
We have a heart recipient
prepped and ready to go.

01:02:23.073 --> 01:02:24.483
You're not supposed
to be in here.

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:25.734
Are you Dickinson?

01:02:25.825 --> 01:02:27.861
Get out. Just get out, please.

01:02:27.953 --> 01:02:29.238
Take it easy, doctor.

01:02:29.329 --> 01:02:31.866
Get them out of here. Get everyone...
No, no, it's okay, Joe.

01:02:31.957 --> 01:02:33.559
Dickinson... Dickinson's
in the parking structure.

01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:35.770
I just spoke to him. He said, "let's
move them both into surgery."

01:02:35.794 --> 01:02:37.159
Let's go. Wait!

01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:39.210
Okay? Hey, Joe, it's all right.

01:02:39.297 --> 01:02:40.833
Joe: It's not all right.

01:02:41.091 --> 01:02:42.627
He's not ready to be moved.

01:02:43.551 --> 01:02:45.792
What are we waiting for?
Come on, move him out.

01:02:46.554 --> 01:02:47.885
Charlie, wait a sec. What?

01:02:48.056 --> 01:02:49.262
This man's not dead.

01:02:49.808 --> 01:02:51.548
The brain scan jumped. I saw it.

01:02:52.102 --> 01:02:53.717
I saw it on the monitor.

01:02:53.853 --> 01:02:55.639
Come on, Joe,
it's flat as a pancake.

01:02:55.772 --> 01:02:57.728
Come on!
Let's move him out of here.

01:02:59.567 --> 01:03:00.773
Charlie, listen.

01:03:04.114 --> 01:03:06.776
Charlie, something's going on.
Don't do this yet.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.800
Don't kill this man. Joe, get ahold
of yourself. This man is dead.

01:03:10.912 --> 01:03:12.152
He spoke to me. Joe, please.

01:03:12.247 --> 01:03:14.238
I'm telling you.
Joe, this man cannot speak.

01:03:14.332 --> 01:03:16.744
It was Emily! It was her voice.

01:03:16.835 --> 01:03:18.575
I am not crazy! You back off.

01:03:18.712 --> 01:03:20.327
Don't talk like this.
You gotta...

01:03:20.964 --> 01:03:23.046
You got to listen to me.
Just a sec.

01:03:23.174 --> 01:03:25.256
Charlie, just hold off
for one minute.

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:27.591
Leave me alone with him.
This is nuts, Joe.

01:03:27.679 --> 01:03:28.964
Come on, get him inside!

01:03:29.055 --> 01:03:30.966
Hey! Hey! Easy! Easy!

01:03:31.057 --> 01:03:33.013
Back off, man!
Charlie: Get inside!

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:35.391
Man: Somebody get security!

01:03:35.603 --> 01:03:37.935
Get him out of here!
For god's sake, Joe!

01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:39.934
Charlie! Get security, will you!

01:03:40.025 --> 01:03:42.858
Charlie, one fucking minute!
Get him out here!

01:03:42.986 --> 01:03:44.317
Grab his hand! Woman: Joe!

01:03:45.196 --> 01:03:47.027
We need security
in two south, right away.

01:03:47.115 --> 01:03:49.106
Joe: Please listen to me!

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:14.176
Joe: Thanks for coming down.

01:04:18.396 --> 01:04:20.728
You posted bail? First offense.

01:04:20.815 --> 01:04:22.351
I got it waived.

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:25.229
I also spoke to the hospital
administrator who's willing to

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:28.278
drop all charges if you agree
to take a lengthy sabbatical.

01:04:29.407 --> 01:04:30.647
I'll bet.

01:04:30.742 --> 01:04:33.279
He said you claimed a brain-dead
organ donor spoke to you.

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:34.370
Is that true?

01:04:35.288 --> 01:04:36.288
No.

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:37.991
Good.

01:04:39.084 --> 01:04:40.119
It was Emily.

01:04:43.004 --> 01:04:44.164
Speaking through him.

01:04:46.466 --> 01:04:48.486
You know, I could almost
understand it with the kids,

01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:50.000
because they all knew her.

01:04:50.095 --> 01:04:51.489
Of course they're going
to dream about her,

01:04:51.513 --> 01:04:53.049
she was key to their survival.

01:04:53.348 --> 01:04:56.465
Okay, then how about the kid who
never even laid eyes on her?

01:04:56.643 --> 01:04:59.885
What kid? The kid I told
you about in the kitchen.

01:04:59.979 --> 01:05:02.470
The first time he ever met her
was in a coma, Miriam, remember?

01:05:02.941 --> 01:05:04.806
I've got his admission
records to prove it.

01:05:05.652 --> 01:05:08.064
That's evidence, right?
Isn't that what you wanted?

01:05:09.781 --> 01:05:12.113
She's trying to reach me
and she's becoming desperate.

01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:16.152
Why? Why desperate, Joe?

01:05:20.667 --> 01:05:22.532
Oh, you don't think
she's still alive?

01:05:22.919 --> 01:05:24.188
If a kid could see her
in a coma,

01:05:24.212 --> 01:05:27.579
then why couldn't she be trying
to communicate from one?

01:05:27.674 --> 01:05:29.539
There were no survivors!

01:05:29.634 --> 01:05:32.626
The venezuelan government searched
the jungle for almost a month.

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:34.756
And never found her! Exactly.

01:05:34.848 --> 01:05:36.213
And that's why
we're here tonight.

01:05:36.307 --> 01:05:39.140
Because you never saw her
body and never got closure.

01:05:43.523 --> 01:05:44.638
Emily's dead, Joe.

01:05:46.609 --> 01:05:47.815
That's what this is all about.

01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:50.067
Your refusal to accept that.

01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:53.438
Look, I understand it.

01:05:54.242 --> 01:05:57.109
If I hadn't seen Hannah's body, I
wouldn't have believed it either.

01:05:57.745 --> 01:06:00.327
I'd still be waiting for her to
come home, just like you are.

01:06:02.292 --> 01:06:04.499
You have to end this, Joe.

01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:07.626
You've got to do the hard stuff.

01:06:07.714 --> 01:06:10.205
Like I did. Like everyone does.

01:06:11.092 --> 01:06:14.926
You got to clean out the
closets, empty the drawers,

01:06:15.013 --> 01:06:17.129
and take down the
vacancy sign that says,

01:06:17.223 --> 01:06:18.963
"Emily's ghost is welcome here,"

01:06:19.058 --> 01:06:21.219
and get on with your life
without her.

01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:32.394
All right.

01:06:38.036 --> 01:06:39.367
What about that rafting trip?

01:06:41.623 --> 01:06:42.954
What do you mean? What about it?

01:06:43.082 --> 01:06:45.073
Well, anything to get
your mind off of this.

01:06:46.503 --> 01:06:47.709
So you think I should go?

01:06:48.296 --> 01:06:49.296
Maybe I'll go with you.

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:52.292
Huh? I'm mean with a paddle.

01:06:54.802 --> 01:06:56.383
The river's up
this time of year.

01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:59.842
It's gone from a two-point
difficulty to a five.

01:07:00.308 --> 01:07:02.640
I want us all to go home,
and go over our river maps.

01:07:03.102 --> 01:07:06.094
Note the hazard points,
the portages, the waterfalls.

01:07:06.231 --> 01:07:09.064
Check out these safari pants.
It says to pack light.

01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:11.482
I'm just bringing my phone.
I'm bringing my camera.

01:07:11.778 --> 01:07:13.380
It better be disposable,
because it's likely

01:07:13.404 --> 01:07:16.521
that everything's gonna go in the drink.
Speaking of drink...

01:07:17.283 --> 01:07:18.989
Here's to adventure. Yeah. Yeah.

01:07:19.077 --> 01:07:20.077
Adventure.

01:07:37.887 --> 01:07:39.343
Joe: What do you think?

01:07:40.807 --> 01:07:42.798
I think it's an idea
whose time has come.

01:07:43.851 --> 01:07:46.217
No, I mean,
do you think it'll sell?

01:07:47.522 --> 01:07:49.478
The agent said it needed
a paint job.

01:07:49.566 --> 01:07:51.397
Oh! Get what you can
and get out.

01:07:52.235 --> 01:07:53.475
Leave the memories behind.

01:07:54.153 --> 01:07:55.313
You didn't after Hannah died.

01:07:55.947 --> 01:07:59.030
Yeah, but I didn't have corpses
playing ventriloquist with me either.

01:08:01.744 --> 01:08:02.950
I'm gonna miss you, Joe.

01:08:05.456 --> 01:08:07.071
I'm gonna miss your waffles.

01:08:10.753 --> 01:08:12.960
Would you show it for me
if I'm gone for a week?

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:15.546
I'm taking that whitewater trip.

01:08:16.009 --> 01:08:17.009
With pleasure.

01:08:18.469 --> 01:08:20.229
It's good to see you
joining the world again.

01:12:57.206 --> 01:13:00.664
Hal over phone: Hello? Hal, reading the
map of the river, there's a symbol.

01:13:01.252 --> 01:13:03.618
Two wavery lines
that crisscross in the middle.

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:06.455
Hal: Waterfalls. Put a big
red circle around those.

01:13:06.549 --> 01:13:07.834
We'll have to portage there.

01:13:07.925 --> 01:13:09.290
They're too high
this time of year.

01:13:12.471 --> 01:13:13.471
Joe?

01:13:46.172 --> 01:13:47.628
A rainbow.

01:14:10.905 --> 01:14:12.896
You are the doctor? Yes.

01:14:19.664 --> 01:14:22.781
Is my pilot here?
That is me. Victor.

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:29.625
I take your bags. You've
been flying long, Victor?

01:14:31.175 --> 01:14:32.881
Don't worry, I know how.

01:14:33.177 --> 01:14:34.462
You have a license
though, right?

01:14:35.221 --> 01:14:36.882
Si, pretty much.

01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:44.677
Juanajuapa.

01:14:45.731 --> 01:14:47.062
Juanajuapa. You've been there?

01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:49.060
Si, juanajuapa.

01:14:50.778 --> 01:14:51.778
This is it, right?

01:14:54.657 --> 01:14:55.657
With the waterfall?

01:14:57.243 --> 01:14:59.780
I don't know. I've only
been there in the dry season.

01:15:04.041 --> 01:15:05.326
Joe: Is my interpreter here?

01:15:05.418 --> 01:15:07.830
The yanomami speak
a little Spanish.

01:15:08.295 --> 01:15:09.876
I speak a little guaharibo.

01:15:10.673 --> 01:15:12.254
You talk to them through me.

01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:14.548
Okay, we go.

01:15:26.188 --> 01:15:28.679
Is that your girlfriend
in the picture?

01:15:30.526 --> 01:15:31.526
It's my wife.

01:15:32.945 --> 01:15:33.980
Used to be.

01:15:36.907 --> 01:15:38.272
You come to get her back?

01:15:42.163 --> 01:15:43.653
In a way, I guess.

01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:58.501
There was an accident
here last spring.

01:15:59.055 --> 01:16:02.047
A bus that washed away
on the road.

01:16:03.934 --> 01:16:05.620
The red cross?
Yes, that's right.

01:16:05.644 --> 01:16:08.761
You can probably see it now
that the river's not so high.

01:16:09.190 --> 01:16:11.101
It's just up ahead.
It's on the way.

01:16:15.404 --> 01:16:17.486
Victor: The rock slide
took more than just a bus.

01:16:17.865 --> 01:16:21.028
It isolated an entire tribe
from the outside world.

01:16:21.786 --> 01:16:24.027
Can you see it? Down there?

01:16:28.793 --> 01:16:29.908
Nobody lived.

01:16:31.212 --> 01:16:33.544
The yanomami are still wearing
some of their clothing.

01:16:35.132 --> 01:16:37.168
That's juanajuapa up ahead.

01:16:38.928 --> 01:16:41.260
Some of the bodies
washed out of the bus,

01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:43.637
down the river and right
into the village.

01:17:07.123 --> 01:17:08.613
Victor:
The guides we are meeting,

01:17:08.707 --> 01:17:10.948
they work with all the tribes
in the area.

01:17:12.711 --> 01:17:15.043
Did I mention they
don't like outsiders?

01:17:22.263 --> 01:17:24.299
It's a good thing
you have me with you.

01:18:06.432 --> 01:18:09.344
He says he cannot
take you to the village.

01:18:10.269 --> 01:18:11.304
But for a price,

01:18:13.147 --> 01:18:14.427
he can take you to their graves.

01:20:35.039 --> 01:20:36.154
Victor: Senor?

01:20:37.041 --> 01:20:38.041
Yeah?

01:20:38.125 --> 01:20:39.535
Senor.

01:20:40.502 --> 01:20:41.787
We should go.

01:20:48.385 --> 01:20:49.500
They, uh...

01:20:51.388 --> 01:20:53.424
They wouldn't know,
would they, which, uh,

01:20:55.142 --> 01:20:56.632
body was buried where?

01:20:59.813 --> 01:21:03.055
If the weather gets any worse,

01:21:03.150 --> 01:21:04.150
we don't get out of here.

01:21:05.569 --> 01:21:07.184
And that's no good for nobody.

01:21:34.515 --> 01:21:35.515
Senores.

01:21:37.184 --> 01:21:38.299
Senores.

01:21:39.061 --> 01:21:40.301
My wife...

01:21:40.396 --> 01:21:41.681
Su esposa.

01:21:41.772 --> 01:21:42.978
Mi esposa.

01:21:43.649 --> 01:21:44.729
Red cross.

01:21:47.194 --> 01:21:48.229
Where?

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:49.730
Donde? Donde?

01:21:50.197 --> 01:21:52.233
Does anybody know where?

01:21:54.535 --> 01:21:55.991
Which one?

01:21:59.415 --> 01:22:00.415
What?

01:22:01.083 --> 01:22:02.083
What are they saying?

01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:03.949
They say they know her.

01:22:13.887 --> 01:22:15.567
What's he saying now?
What's he saying now?

01:22:16.014 --> 01:22:20.633
He says he wants to take you to the village
and he says no, you need permission.

01:22:22.229 --> 01:22:24.015
What's he saying? What
the hell is he saying?

01:22:24.314 --> 01:22:25.599
I don't know!

01:22:46.628 --> 01:22:47.628
Senor!

01:22:49.256 --> 01:22:50.871
Senor, you cannot go into
the village!

01:22:51.341 --> 01:22:53.081
Victor: It is forbidden! Senor!

01:22:56.722 --> 01:22:57.722
Senor!

01:22:58.098 --> 01:22:59.258
Senor, stop!

01:23:12.446 --> 01:23:13.811
Senor.

01:23:14.573 --> 01:23:16.484
We can return
with government people,

01:23:16.575 --> 01:23:18.657
but you must come back
with me, now!

01:23:25.167 --> 01:23:27.078
I said now, senor!

01:23:30.506 --> 01:23:32.292
Victor: No, no, no.

01:26:19.841 --> 01:26:21.547
Ben: She wants you
to go there, Joe.

01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:22.987
Miriam: Join her. Jeffrey: Joe!

01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:24.922
Emily: Joe? Jeffrey:
Joe, can't you hear me?

01:26:26.515 --> 01:26:27.846
Emily: Joe!

01:26:29.142 --> 01:26:32.305
Sister Madeline: A hundred steps
on the ladder of consciousness.

01:26:35.774 --> 01:26:37.639
Miriam: No survivors.
Joe: Where's her body?

01:26:37.734 --> 01:26:39.014
Miriam: Think she's still alive?

01:26:39.653 --> 01:26:41.234
Joe: Emily! Emily: Joe!

01:26:41.405 --> 01:26:42.815
Listen to me!

01:29:59.769 --> 01:30:02.135
You are one crazy son of a bitch.
You know that?

01:30:02.522 --> 01:30:03.802
You're lucky to be alive, senor.

01:30:03.857 --> 01:30:04.857
You were not breathing.

01:30:04.941 --> 01:30:06.397
It's been over an hour. Get up.

01:30:08.028 --> 01:30:10.064
We will cross
the river downstream.

01:30:10.530 --> 01:30:13.397
With a little bit of luck, we can get
to the airstrip before nightfall.

01:30:13.950 --> 01:30:16.111
Vamanos. She lived through
the bus accident.

01:30:24.794 --> 01:30:26.074
Joe: She made it to the village.

01:30:28.924 --> 01:30:30.539
You cannot go to the village!

01:30:30.634 --> 01:30:33.421
Stop! I cannot go back
without you.

01:30:33.511 --> 01:30:34.671
They'll take away my license!

01:30:36.097 --> 01:30:37.097
Victor: Stop, senor!

01:31:00.497 --> 01:31:01.907
Senor!

01:31:02.666 --> 01:31:04.748
Senor, stop! Don't do this!

01:31:28.858 --> 01:31:30.268
Senor!

01:31:34.072 --> 01:31:36.859
The man said
we must have permission.

01:31:39.661 --> 01:31:40.741
I've got permission.

01:31:42.288 --> 01:31:43.744
No one's keeping me
out of there.

01:32:34.632 --> 01:32:35.917
Please.

01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:38.091
My wife.

01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:40.220
Did you know her?

01:32:41.973 --> 01:32:43.429
Mi esposa.

01:32:46.019 --> 01:32:47.134
Did you know her?

01:32:52.776 --> 01:32:54.016
Mi esposa.

01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:01.360
Doctore.

01:33:06.706 --> 01:33:08.992
Doctore. Mi esposa.

01:33:13.088 --> 01:33:14.578
Mi esposa.

01:33:17.175 --> 01:33:18.915
The waterfall.

01:33:19.761 --> 01:33:21.046
She was here.

01:33:44.744 --> 01:33:45.824
Come here.

01:33:57.006 --> 01:33:59.713
She says they knew her alive.

01:34:01.136 --> 01:34:02.672
She came to help them

01:34:05.014 --> 01:34:07.380
until the river
brought her back.

01:34:09.018 --> 01:34:10.098
Dying.

01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:26.566
They could not save her body,

01:34:27.787 --> 01:34:29.402
but they saved her soul.

01:36:20.650 --> 01:36:22.311
Jenuall.

01:36:24.904 --> 01:36:26.519
Jenuall.

01:36:30.285 --> 01:36:32.116
She said, "dragonfly."

01:36:58.855 --> 01:37:00.641
Joe: I don't know if Emily
ever saw her,

01:37:01.357 --> 01:37:03.518
at least while she was of
mind and body.

01:37:05.069 --> 01:37:08.357
And I don't know how the baby
survived premature,

01:37:09.324 --> 01:37:11.736
so small and fragile
in the middle of a jungle.

01:37:14.787 --> 01:37:18.905
What I do know is that Emily made sure
our child found her way into my arms.

01:37:21.210 --> 01:37:24.623
What she taught me in life,
she taught me in death.

01:37:26.507 --> 01:37:29.089
To trust. To have faith.

01:37:31.971 --> 01:37:33.711
Because, as a friend
of mine once said,

01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:38.512
"it's belief that
gets us there.â
