I'm sorry for taking so long.

07:00.200 --> 07:01.167
Not at all.

07:01.840 --> 07:03.604
Take them 3 times a day.

07:03.760 --> 07:05.091
Or she'll have seizure again.

07:08.720 --> 07:11.371
Will you be okay?

07:12.200 --> 07:14.776
I know you're moving
for your sake,

07:14.800 --> 07:19.601
it'd be better
if she stays with us.

Upstairs.
Upstairs.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.046
Mother?

09:11.280 --> 09:14.363
Do you remember anything?

10:44.760 --> 10:46.125
Granny!

10:48.960 --> 10:50.246
Granny?

10:53.200 --> 10:55.176
Sis, you're here.

10:55.200 --> 10:57.696
Your sister is in heaven.

10:57.720 --> 11:00.041

you'll be late for school!

11:00.160 --> 11:02.049
Okay!
Come up!

11:04.480 --> 11:07.245
Sis, do you hear that?

11:11.640 --> 11:15.565
That's not him, he's dead.

11:18.640 --> 11:22.611
Mom said when you hear
dead people's voices,

11:23.120 --> 11:25.441
it is nearby.

11:26.520 --> 11:27.521
“It?”

11:29.880 --> 11:30.881
<i>Soon-ja...</i>

Hee-yeon-yeon!

12:50.480 --> 12:51.720
Honey?

13:05.040 --> 13:07.416
Honey, I think I saw
Jun-suh earlier.

13:07.440 --> 13:11.126
Remember his sneakers?
He was wearing them.

13:12.040 --> 13:14.168
Did you take your meds?

13:15.800 --> 13:17.165
Jun-suhs here!

13:17.360 --> 13:20.125
How?
He disappeared in Seoul.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.936
He could be here
looking for your father.

13:22.960 --> 13:24.883
He lived here!

13:27.720 --> 13:29.051
Hee-yeon.
Honey!

13:29.280 --> 13:32.856
Can't we look for him again?

13:32.880 --> 13:34.370
It's already been 5 years.

13:34.480 --> 13:37.484
You promised me.
Then just forget him?!

13:37.640 --> 13:40.296
Wipe him from memory?
Cops are looking into it.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.288
You know that's bullshit!

13:42.600 --> 13:44.011
You know that!

13:44.480 --> 13:47.484
We ended up like this
because of them!

13:57.840 --> 14:01.526
And Jun-hee?
What about our daughter?

14:02.120 --> 14:04.407
Leave her alone again?

14:04.760 --> 14:07.809
Without dad,
no one can look after her.

14:08.480 --> 14:11.643
I'll go to the station soon,

14:12.000 --> 14:14.480
and ask them to
continue the search.

14:19.120 --> 14:23.728
<i>Please find our son Jun-sub</i>

15:12.480 --> 15:14.369
Do you need help?

15:21.640 --> 15:24.325
It's our puppy.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.322
You mistook Mong for Ttotti?
<i>Please find Ttotti</i>

15:30.320 --> 15:33.642
Ttotti will know that
you're looking for him,

15:33.880 --> 15:36.247
and that you still remember him.

15:39.040 --> 15:43.841
So don't give up
and keep looking.

15:44.520 --> 15:45.931
Okay?

16:05.520 --> 16:06.567

19:02.880 --> 19:03.961
You sure you saw it?

19:04.400 --> 19:07.563
It was really there.
I'm sure.

19:10.320 --> 19:11.560
Look.

19:12.800 --> 19:14.848
There's nothing here, you see?

19:16.160 --> 19:17.571
It was there.

19:18.320 --> 19:20.004
You didn't see what it was?

19:20.320 --> 19:22.721
No, I didn't.

23:58.160 --> 23:59.082
It's alright.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.496
Excuse me,

Could you tell me what happened?

24:21.600 --> 24:22.249
What?

24:22.480 --> 24:25.802
You want us to repeat
our statement?

24:26.680 --> 24:27.567
Yes, ma'am.

24:29.560 --> 24:32.245
How many times do we
have to repeat that?

24:32.800 --> 24:34.165
Is this how you work?

24:35.120 --> 24:36.616
I think there's been...

24:36.640 --> 24:38.642
What about the girl?
Did you find her?

24:39.400 --> 24:41.296
What girl are you referring to?

24:41.320 --> 24:43.721
I said there was a girl
around here.

24:43.840 --> 24:45.126
There was a girl?

24:45.560 --> 24:48.166

Yes.

26:59.040 --> 27:01.088
Most are missing cases.

27:04.240 --> 27:07.961
They all said people who went
missing said similar things.

35:33.960 --> 35:35.416
You're so excited.

35:35.440 --> 35:37.124
Yeah, I am.

35:38.200 --> 35:40.965
It's not your first time
feeding him, though.

35:41.280 --> 35:43.521
I'll feed him everyday!

35:56.600 --> 35:57.761
Jun-suh?

36:03.640 --> 36:05.802
Dad, can I give him more?

36:07.040 --> 36:08.201
Sure.

36:13.600 --> 36:16.604
Dad, he waggles his tail
when I mention 'treats.'

36:27.280 --> 36:28.520
Are you Mr. Choi Jung-su?

36:29.080 --> 36:29.729
What?

36:30.040 --> 36:31.644
Please sit down.

36:33.280 --> 36:35.408
Sorry for asking you
to come so late.

36:35.560 --> 36:38.564
Do you own Sonata 4268202?

36:39.520 --> 36:42.603
Your vehicle was found
near the Mt. Dang.

36:44.720 --> 36:46.006
Take a look.

36:51.160 --> 36:52.161
My vision is...

36:52.440 --> 36:54.283
Is this your car?

36:54.680 --> 36:56.256
Yes, it is.

36:56.280 --> 36:58.886
How do you know
Ms. Yoon Min-ji?

36:59.800 --> 37:03.247
She was found inside
a closed down cave.

37:04.280 --> 37:05.805
She was found dead.

37:09.920 --> 37:12.082
When did you last see Yoon?

37:12.240 --> 37:14.368
How do you know her?

37:17.800 --> 37:18.961
Mr. Choi?

37:20.240 --> 37:21.526
Sir?

37:26.200 --> 37:29.807
<i>Honey, help me.</i>

37:29.960 --> 37:31.056
<i>Help me!</i>

37:31.080 --> 37:33.208
<i>Come to me, I'm in the cave...</i>

38:31.640 --> 38:32.880
Don't go...

38:33.760 --> 38:35.364
Please...

39:11.640 --> 39:13.404
Snap out of it!

40:20.040 --> 40:21.201
Honey...

40:24.240 --> 40:27.847
<i>Honey, help me...</i>

40:44.840 --> 40:46.490
<i>Help me!</i>

41:20.760 --> 41:22.285
Soon-ja.

41:22.880 --> 41:24.211
<i>It's me, your brother.</i>

41:33.920 --> 41:35.336
Jun-hee, let's go.

41:35.360 --> 41:36.964
I'll be right there!

41:38.840 --> 41:40.968
About that girl...

41:41.160 --> 41:43.003
Girl? Jun-hee?

41:43.160 --> 41:45.016
Not Jun-hee, the kid.

41:45.040 --> 41:46.769
Yeah, Jun-hee.

41:47.120 --> 41:48.724
Her name is also Jun-hee?

41:49.040 --> 41:50.485
Isn't it weird?

41:51.040 --> 41:53.327
Her voice is the same too.

41:53.480 --> 41:56.211
All kids sound similar.

41:58.160 --> 41:59.605
Did you call the police?

42:00.000 --> 42:01.206
Police?

42:01.560 --> 42:02.891
You didn't report?

42:04.400 --> 42:06.607
No, not yet.
Really?

42:08.000 --> 42:11.004
Take her to the station
right away.

42:12.840 --> 42:15.047
Why, something wrong?

42:15.800 --> 42:19.016
No, but she should be stable...

42:19.040 --> 42:20.804
What are you talking about?

42:21.280 --> 42:23.886
Imagine her parents,
they must be worried sick.

42:25.240 --> 42:27.163
We shouldn't do that.

42:29.160 --> 42:30.366
Dad!

42:31.840 --> 42:35.016
Get her to the station,
we can't keep her.

42:35.040 --> 42:36.176
Okay.

42:36.200 --> 42:37.361
Let's go, dad.

42:38.040 --> 42:39.121
Do it today, okay?

42:41.120 --> 42:44.124
Soon-ja, It's me.

42:44.280 --> 42:47.568
<i>Come here, Pm right here.</i>

42:47.920 --> 42:50.651
We can go home now.
Let's go home.

42:50.920 --> 42:53.016
<i>It's been hard,
we can be together.</i>

42:53.040 --> 42:56.136
<i>Let's go home,
Soon-ja.</i>

42:56.160 --> 42:57.924
<i>This is our home.
Come here.</i>

43:04.800 --> 43:06.290
Jun-hee?

43:30.680 --> 43:32.330
Jun-hee?

43:33.160 --> 43:34.764
Jun-hee?

43:36.160 --> 43:37.616
Are you sleeping?

43:37.640 --> 43:39.244
<i>Are you sleeping?</i>

44:19.760 --> 44:20.807
Jun-heel

44:21.080 --> 44:23.367
What are you doing here?

44:23.800 --> 44:26.644
<i>Come out, come here.</i>

44:29.440 --> 44:32.683
Jun-hee, why were you
hiding in here?

44:33.800 --> 44:35.404
You can tell me.

44:35.640 --> 44:36.607
What's wrong?

44:39.480 --> 44:40.288
Mother!

44:40.480 --> 44:42.801
Mother, stop!

44:53.920 --> 44:55.968
Get away!
Jun-hee, run!

45:08.080 --> 45:09.161
It's not him!

45:11.520 --> 45:12.760
Not my brother...

45:14.480 --> 45:15.447
It's not him!

45:15.680 --> 45:17.170
Please stop!

45:18.040 --> 45:19.041
Mother!

45:21.720 --> 45:23.927
It's not him...

45:24.320 --> 45:26.322
Let's go home...

45:26.640 --> 45:29.120
It's not him,
sis, let's go home.

45:58.280 --> 45:59.566
Jun-hee.

46:06.520 --> 46:08.761
Jun-hee, come here.

46:25.400 --> 46:26.561
It's okay.

46:28.080 --> 46:30.162
You can trust me.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.525
Don't be scared.

46:34.200 --> 46:35.440
Trust me.

47:03.040 --> 47:04.883
Mom...

47:05.840 --> 47:07.080
I know...

47:09.160 --> 47:10.969
It's been hard.

47:12.760 --> 47:14.603
How hard was it,

47:16.400 --> 47:18.528
being away from home?

47:20.360 --> 47:21.885
I know, baby.

47:23.640 --> 47:25.290
I'm sorry.

47:25.640 --> 47:28.769
Mommy's sorry, I really am...

47:39.320 --> 47:40.731
Let's go.

48:06.040 --> 48:07.246
It's not him...

48:07.880 --> 48:08.767
Mom.

48:09.240 --> 48:10.810
Did you do this?

48:29.720 --> 48:32.200
She threw away her pills.

48:33.560 --> 48:35.801
I should've checked.

48:44.920 --> 48:47.207
This is it for mom.

48:48.680 --> 48:51.411
We can't take care of her
on our own.

48:52.880 --> 48:54.803
Let's move her
to the senior home.

48:55.040 --> 48:56.769
I called So-Jung already.

48:57.640 --> 48:59.563
I'll do better.

48:59.880 --> 49:00.802
Hee-yeon.

49:00.960 --> 49:04.362
You know very well,
she's our last hope.

49:06.640 --> 49:07.527
Honey...

49:08.240 --> 49:10.208
You still believe that?

49:10.960 --> 49:12.200
Mom!

49:16.800 --> 49:18.643
Why are you still up?

49:18.840 --> 49:21.411
I can't sleep.
Is that so?

49:22.280 --> 49:23.725
Let's go back to your room.

49:23.960 --> 49:27.009
I'll stay with you
until you fall asleep.

49:28.400 --> 49:30.164
Dad, good night.

49:48.120 --> 49:49.485
Mom.

49:53.560 --> 49:55.483
Who's Jun-suh?

49:57.480 --> 49:59.562
Where did you hear that name?

49:59.880 --> 50:02.042
You called him out.

50:03.360 --> 50:05.362
In your sleep.

50:20.080 --> 50:22.845
<i>He's Jun-hee's brother.</i>

50:23.600 --> 50:25.170
My brother?

50:29.480 --> 50:30.561
Yes, your brother.

50:31.160 --> 50:33.561
Where is he now?

50:37.640 --> 50:38.971
Well...

50:40.520 --> 50:42.443
Where could he be?

50:54.880 --> 50:56.450
You don't know?

50:57.320 --> 50:58.526
No.

51:00.640 --> 51:05.567
Granny might know,
but she can't talk.

51:05.840 --> 51:07.126
Why?

51:08.320 --> 51:10.527
<i>Granny's</i>

51:10.960 --> 51:13.122
<i>head hurts.</i>

51:14.600 --> 51:17.080
<i>So she can? Remember Well.</i>

51:38.120 --> 51:40.202
What are you doing?

51:43.200 --> 51:44.804
What's going on?!

51:45.760 --> 51:47.762
And you?
Me?

51:47.920 --> 51:49.445
With that kid!

51:49.840 --> 51:51.001
Jun-hee?

51:51.240 --> 51:53.004
Like hell she's Jun-hee.

51:53.360 --> 51:55.362
What do you mean?

51:55.600 --> 51:58.524
Forget it, take her to
the station tomorrow.

51:58.840 --> 52:01.207
That's not the problem!

52:01.800 --> 52:03.776
Don't you know
what happened today?

52:03.800 --> 52:06.531
That's why I want mom
in senior home!

52:07.280 --> 52:08.725
You alone can't do this!

52:09.000 --> 52:10.968
Can you handle our baby too?

52:13.680 --> 52:15.808
Why's everything so easy to you?

52:15.920 --> 52:16.523
What?

52:16.880 --> 52:19.565
Send Jun-hee away,
and mother too.

52:19.920 --> 52:21.888
Just ship them off
and that's it?

52:22.920 --> 52:23.896
But that's...

52:23.920 --> 52:25.331
Do you ever
think about Jun-suh?

52:25.880 --> 52:29.362
Your son,
our son Jun-suh!

52:35.120 --> 52:39.205
When I look at that girl,
I'm reminded of him.

52:40.280 --> 52:43.376
He could be out there
needing someones help.

52:43.400 --> 52:44.526
Hee-yeon-yeon!

52:44.640 --> 52:46.449
I can't give up on him!

52:46.840 --> 52:49.207
I'm gonna keep
searching for him!

52:50.840 --> 52:52.444
I can't,

52:52.840 --> 52:56.242
I can't give up on him.
No, I won't.

52:57.480 --> 52:59.608
Stay here alone if you want!

53:00.120 --> 53:02.407
I'm going to look after mother!

53:02.560 --> 53:05.006
And call the detectives again!

53:05.360 --> 53:07.736
I'm going back to Seoul,

53:07.760 --> 53:09.967
Mom... and put up
the flyers again...

53:10.680 --> 53:13.001
He's out there!

53:13.240 --> 53:14.480
Stop it.

53:15.040 --> 53:16.451
Please stop!

53:16.640 --> 53:20.531
Honey, that's enough!
Just stop it already!

53:31.760 --> 53:33.250
Hee-yeon.

53:34.680 --> 53:36.284
Our boy...

53:37.240 --> 53:39.402
He's...

53:40.040 --> 53:41.849
Our son...

53:44.360 --> 53:46.283
He's dead.

53:53.040 --> 53:55.281
We have to believe that.

53:56.760 --> 54:00.287
Let him go,
we can't go on like this.

54:01.880 --> 54:03.530
Let our boy go.

54:41.880 --> 54:43.484
Soon-ja.

54:46.280 --> 54:48.806
Soon-ja, come here.

54:50.120 --> 54:51.531
<i>Pm right here.</i>

54:51.720 --> 54:53.051
My brother is dead.

54:53.360 --> 54:56.364
<i>What do you mean?
I'm still alive.</i>

54:57.200 --> 54:58.056
I'm here.

54:58.080 --> 55:00.496
Sis!
Come to me.

55:00.520 --> 55:03.364
That's not our brother,
let's go home, sis!

55:03.560 --> 55:05.642
Let's go home!

55:09.680 --> 55:11.125
<i>This is our home.</i>

55:14.520 --> 55:17.524
<i>I'm with our brother.</i>
Sis!

55:17.840 --> 55:19.330
I missed you...

55:19.600 --> 55:23.002
Sis, I missed you so much!

55:23.120 --> 55:26.736
<i>I know It's tough there.
I missed you!</i>

55:26.760 --> 55:27.761
Come over.

55:27.920 --> 55:29.936
<i>Soon-ja, this is our home.</i>

55:29.960 --> 55:33.646
Sis! Sis!

55:34.840 --> 55:38.936
Soon-ja, come here.
What took you so long'?

55:38.960 --> 55:41.930
<i>Soon-ja, come.</i>

55:42.680 --> 55:45.411
<i>Soon-ja, Soon-jar'</i>

55:46.720 --> 55:50.725
Take me with you,
I want to be with you...

55:59.640 --> 56:00.926
<i>Granny!</i>

56:02.280 --> 56:03.088
Mother?

56:03.480 --> 56:04.845
Granny!

56:05.760 --> 56:06.886
Mom!

57:10.680 --> 57:13.126
Do you know where granny went?

57:33.280 --> 57:36.523
I can't reach
my husband all day.

57:37.000 --> 57:41.767
I think something happened
while looking for mother.

57:43.200 --> 57:47.808
I think this town is strange.

57:48.280 --> 57:49.247
How come?

57:49.480 --> 57:51.687
Not just mother and him,

57:51.960 --> 57:55.248
there were those 2 kids
looking for a dog,

57:56.040 --> 58:00.576
and Jun-hee, I think
her parents lost her here.

58:00.600 --> 58:01.886
What girl?

58:02.480 --> 58:06.201
Remember that girl I mentioned'?
The one I asked you to search'?

58:06.560 --> 58:07.336
Yes.

58:07.360 --> 58:11.888
That night I found her here,
and we kept her for a bit.

58:12.080 --> 58:14.367
Can you run her
through the database?

58:14.560 --> 58:15.561
Yes, sir.

58:16.160 --> 58:19.369
Ma'am, can I speak to that girl?

58:24.000 --> 58:25.411
Jun-hee?

58:27.680 --> 58:28.936
She was right here.

58:28.960 --> 58:30.200
Jun-hee?

58:34.680 --> 58:35.920
Jun-hee?

58:36.560 --> 58:37.527
Mom.

58:38.040 --> 58:40.281
Jun-heel

58:41.760 --> 58:44.001
Did you see Jun-hee?

58:44.280 --> 58:45.691
Jun-hee, the little girl.

58:45.880 --> 58:50.727
No girls named 'Jun-hee'
are reported missing recently.

58:51.640 --> 58:52.926
What's her physical description?

58:54.640 --> 58:57.484
A bit smaller than my child,

58:57.720 --> 58:59.848
with a bob cut.

59:00.160 --> 59:02.208
She was wearing a pink dress.

59:11.640 --> 59:13.483
Don't worry, ma'am.

59:13.600 --> 59:15.762
We'll do our best to find him.

59:16.040 --> 59:18.566
I'm new here, so I wasn't aware,

59:19.440 --> 59:23.445
but there have been a lot of
missing persons cases here.

59:23.960 --> 59:28.363
And there were a few
statements about the girl.

59:34.640 --> 59:36.244
Yes, it's her.

59:39.520 --> 59:40.521
What is it?

59:41.200 --> 59:44.576
It's not a recent case,
it's from the '80s.

59:44.600 --> 59:46.807
That can't be.

59:50.000 --> 59:51.729
Jun-heel

59:53.080 --> 59:54.525
Jun-heel

59:57.400 --> 59:59.289
<i>Who's the little girl?
Don't know.</i>

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:06.402
<i>Any mention of her?
Not to me.</i>

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.162
Jun-heel

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:14.044
Jun-heel

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:16.846
<i>She asked him to come to her.</i>

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:22.288
Jun-heel

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.764
<i>It's called the Mi. Jang tiger.</i>

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:54.526
<i>A local folktale ghost.</i>

01:00:56.240 --> 01:01:01.280
<i>It mimics human voice
and bewitches people.</i>

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:08.122
<i>There were a few shamans here
who served the tiger.</i>

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:15.644
<i>That shaman also served it
when he moved here.</i>

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:22.123
<i>He was a nobody,</i>

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:26.684
<i>but it all changed once
he started serving it.</i>

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:30.608
<i>He was chosen by the tiger.</i>

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:03.845
Honey! Help!

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:06.129
Honey!

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:09.410
Come here!
Please help!

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.047
It's a ghost!

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:14.283
Honey...

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:19.610
Honey!

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.404
Honey?

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:26.961
Honey! Honey!

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:31.165
<i>The shaman had a daughter,
who had a great aura.</i>

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:34.802
<i>Enduring her father's abuse,</i>

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:38.647
<i>she waited for her mom
to come back.</i>

01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:41.523
Did you miss me?

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:43.844
I told you I'd come back soon.

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:48.521
I'll be with you forever.

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.404
Mom...

01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:56.205
Mom...

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:14.485
<i>The tiger slowly began
taking the shaman's soul.</i>

01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:22.246
<i>But it wasn't satisfied.</i>

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:26.047
<i>It wanted pure
and stronger energy.</i>

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:52.367
<i>The two of them disappeared.</i>

01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:56.401
<i>Probably became
servants of the tiger.</i>

01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:02.370
<i>That's when people
started disappearing.</i>

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:05.803
<i>Sacrificed to the tiger,
most likely.</i>

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:10.488
The girl had stronger energy.

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:17.247
When she breaks the chi,
the shaman will appear.

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:23.361
If you see the girl,
you'll see the shaman soon.

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:29.204
But she's...

01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:32.566
Don't trust her, ever.

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:35.042
They'll use everything
at their disposal.

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:38.729
Guilt, anger, or even longing,

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:42.284
they'll exploit
your vulnerability.

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:48.886
How are your eyes?

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:49.963
What?

01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:54.529
As chi weakens,
your vision will dim.

01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:59.609
Hang this at home.

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:03.166
It'll ward them off temporarily.

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:22.407
Leave at once.

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:25.967
The longer you stay,
the more dangerous it?! get.

01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:36.761
Jun-heel Jun-heel

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:46.731
Mom?

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:51.688
Mom, my eyes are weird.

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:57.205
Mom?

01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:00.685
Jun-hee, come here,
we have to leave!

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:10.807
Mom?

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:14.527
Baby, come to me, come here!

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:31.970
Sweetie, stay there for a bit.

01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:34.282
It's dangerous outside.

01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:37.563
I'll be right there!

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:52.128
Jun-heel

01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:53.726
Jun-heel

01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:58.248
Jun-heel Sweetie!

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:12.360
Jun-hee.

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:16.609
Are you there?

01:08:20.359 --> 01:08:21.441
Jun-hee.

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:38.282
Jun-hee, come here.

01:08:40.319 --> 01:08:42.845
Come on out.

01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:45.649
We have to get out of here.

01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:57.161
Jun-hee, come here.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.240
It's alright.

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:06.290
You can trust me.

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:17.441
Look at my eyes.

01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:20.926
Don't be scared.

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:27.241
Jun-hee, trust me.

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:31.724
Let's go, okay?

01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:46.568
Jun-heel Sweetie!

01:09:47.279 --> 01:09:48.611
Jun-hee...

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:03.961
Jun-hee...

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:08.444
Jun-heel Jun-heel

01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:12.361
Honey...

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:35.566
Jun-heel

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:39.402
Mom, Jun-hee saved me...

01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:50.166
<i>Anyway to save
those who disappeared?</i>

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:53.731
<i>The cave is a turf of the tiger.</i>

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:57.369
<i>The child is the only one
who knows the way.</i>

01:10:58.440 --> 01:10:59.566
Kiddo.

01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:02.730
What's your name?

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:07.085
Be honest with me.

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:09.444
Are you really Jun-hee?

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.240
Jun-hee.

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:25.287
Do you know where
my husband and granny are?

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:30.123
Did they go to the cave?

01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:38.646
If we go there,
can you take me to them?

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.687
What is it?

01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:47.164
Because of dad?

01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:01.283
Mom, will you protect me?

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:05.165
You'll never leave me?

01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:37.090
<i>What's your favorite fairy tale'?</i>

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:38.926
Sun and Moon.

01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:41.482
Right, Sun and Moon.

01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:46.926
You're gonna become
Sun and Moon.

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:52.161
<i>A tiger will mimic me to
eat you from outside the</i> door.

01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:54.610
<i>What did the Sun ask?</i>

01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:57.361
“Show me your hand.”

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:04.731
<i>So should you believe it
because you hear my voice?</i>

01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:07.727
No.
Good.

01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:11.251
Don't trust anyone, got it?

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:16.005
If...

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:17.616
Detective Kim

01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:24.364
<i>If I'm not here tomorrow,
call this police man.</i>

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:13.364
Mom...

01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:16.446
<i>You shouldn't? Make any sound.</i>

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:18.802
<i>Don't ever reply</i>

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:21.926
to any voice.

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:13.085
<i>Who is it?</i>

01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:16.526
<i>Hee-yeon</i>

01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:20.009
<i>Is that you'?</i>

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:22.368
<i>Hello? Is someone there?</i>

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:26.443
<i>I can? See,
can you help?</i>

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:27.496
<i>Mom?</i>

01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:30.410
<i>I followed mom here
and got lost.</i>

01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:32.848
<i>I don't know where I am...</i>

01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:34.176
<i>Jun-bee?!</i>

01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:35.008
<i>Is that you?!</i>

01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:37.441
<i>Mom...
ls your mom there?</i>

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:38.776
<i>Hee-yeon, is that you?</i>

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:41.016
<i>I don't know Where I am.
I can? See anything!</i>

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:42.336
Hee-yeon.

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:45.842
<i>I fell down,
now I can? See!</i>

01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:48.616
<i>Don't listen to that voice!</i>

01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:50.324
<i>It could be that girl!</i>

01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:54.296
<i>Don't believe her,
I followed her here.</i>

01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:55.776
Hee-yeon, can you hear me?

01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:57.211
Mom!

01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:02.003
<i>There's a weird men here!</i>

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:04.402
<i>He's coming at me!</i>

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:09.889
Jun-heel Jun-heel

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:19.521
Jun-hee?

01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:21.926
Jun-hee?

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.126
Mom!

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:15.771
Mom!

01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:19.763
Mom!

01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:34.409
Honey, why're you hiding?
Come out.

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:43.411
Hee-yeon.

01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:00.841
<i>It's your fault, you did this!</i>

01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:02.650
<i>Why do you blame my mother?</i>

01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:04.096
<i>You're his mom!</i>

01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:07.249
<i>Why do you</i> blame me
<i>for Jun-sub?</i>

01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:09.085
<i>It's your fault!?</i>

01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:12.131
<i>He disappeared because of you!</i>

01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:14.176
<i>What'll you do'?!</i>

01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:16.416
<i>I'm here
What'll! You do?!</i>

01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:19.489
Mom, come here.

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:35.723
Our son... <i>He's dead.</i>

01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:37.763
<i>We have to believe that.</i>

01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:41.809
<i>I'm so sorry, Jun-sun
I really am.</i>

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:43.571
So sorry...

01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:00.724
Honey, I'm right here.

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:03.851
<i>Come here, come to me.</i>

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:08.250
I know you're tired.

01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:11.291
Let's get some rest.

01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:15.163
You did all you could.

01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:18.886
Come to me.

01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:34.888
Hee-yeon! Move!

01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:27.762
Are you okay?
I'm fine.

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:35.250
Look up, there should be a hole.

01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:37.520
Can you get up there?

01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:39.896
I fell from there.

01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:40.887
What about you?

01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:42.849
Not me, I can't see at all.

01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:44.525
You have to get out.

01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:48.489
Go and get help.

01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:52.408
Hurry, get going.
I got it.

01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:55.405
Be careful!

01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:14.930
Hee-yeon, you okay?

01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:17.441
Yeah!

01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:42.531
<i>Def. Kim</i>

It's Det. Kim!
Detective! Help!

01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:49.567

Ma'am!

01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:08.806
Are you okay, ma'am?

01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:16.925
Honey! Hee-yeon!

01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:19.007
Hee-yeon.

01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:20.606
Are you okay?

01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:26.761
Ma'am! Wait for me!

01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:28.611
I'm coming down!

01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:34.322
Hee-yeon!

01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:37.729
Honey, over here!

01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:43.251
Over here!

01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:58.806
Come here! Come here!

01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:00.525
Come!

01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:14.322
Mom! Dad!

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:16.166
Hee-yeon, let's move!

01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:18.200
Mom!

01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:20.921
Jun-hee...

01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:23.285
Is it that kid?

01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:25.962
Hee-yeon, don't believe her!

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:28.284
You can't trust her!

01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:31.366
Hee-yeon-yeon!

01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:33.289
Let's go! Please!

01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:34.925
Hee-yeon-yeon!

01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:42.441
Mom, don't go...

01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:48.771
Jun-hee.

01:24:58.280 --> 01:24:59.770
Mom...

01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:11.800
<i>Come with me.</i>

01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:21.646
Mom!

01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:27.005
You said you'd protect me!

01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:28.645
Mom!

01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:30.496
