00:12.760 --> 00:14.700
Wait!

00:14.800 --> 00:16.800
Stop!

00:18.360 --> 00:20.460
-Wait!
-It's done.

00:20.560 --> 00:22.560
You're not leaving me!

00:40.960 --> 00:44.300
I don't care what my father
thinks! I only care about you.

00:44.400 --> 00:46.460
-You don't have a choice.
-I will follow you...

00:46.560 --> 00:48.780
..to the ends of the Earth
if I have to.

00:48.880 --> 00:51.780
-I will leave everything.
-You can't say that!

00:51.880 --> 00:53.180
This is your life.
This is who you are.

00:53.280 --> 00:56.540
-Don't tell me who I am!
-"Don't tell me who I am."

00:56.640 --> 00:58.780
-Everyone, my entire life...

00:58.880 --> 01:00.620
..has told me what to do
and who I'm allowed to love.

01:00.720 --> 01:04.420
I have nothing!
Don't you understand?

01:04.520 --> 01:07.840
That's you, remember?
You're on TV.

01:12.680 --> 01:14.060
Why are you laughing?

01:14.160 --> 01:16.540
Because maybe we really
are like two swans.

01:16.640 --> 01:20.420
When one leaves, the other dies
of a broken heart.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.800
Alfie.

01:35.200 --> 01:37.420
Thank God.

01:37.520 --> 01:38.820
There you are.

01:38.920 --> 01:40.180
She came to our place.

01:40.280 --> 01:42.420
Thanks, mate, you're a champion.
Thanks for bringing her back.

01:42.520 --> 01:45.460
-I better go, Ray.
-It's pouring out there.

01:45.560 --> 01:47.260
Too wild. Stay here -
I'll drop you back.

01:47.360 --> 01:51.160
No, it's fine. I'll run fast.
Bye, Mrs Reed.

02:06.800 --> 02:08.800
Alfie!

04:14.440 --> 04:16.340
What are you.... Idiot!

04:16.440 --> 04:19.440
You can't run down the road
naked, mate!

04:26.120 --> 04:28.120
Oh, well.

04:32.200 --> 04:34.140
Hey!

04:34.240 --> 04:36.240
You little shit!

05:29.720 --> 05:31.720
G'day, mate.

05:32.960 --> 05:35.120
How's it going?

05:41.640 --> 05:43.640
Thanks for the jacket.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.800
Mum's the word, eh?

06:47.040 --> 06:49.040
Hey!

06:52.280 --> 06:54.280
Hey kid! Beat it!

06:57.800 --> 06:59.800
-Hey!

07:28.720 --> 07:31.380
Yeah, we did order it
on the 16th.

07:31.480 --> 07:33.920
No, it's not here.

07:35.880 --> 07:39.340
Yeah, well, we've been waiting.
It's really frustrating.

07:39.440 --> 07:43.020
We still don't
have any oranges.

07:43.120 --> 07:44.620
OK, appreciate it.

07:44.720 --> 07:47.540
-Hi, Ray.
-Margot. How is she?

07:47.640 --> 07:49.660
She's good.

07:49.760 --> 07:53.820
And I'm a nurse - a medical
professional, not a waitress.

07:53.920 --> 07:56.100
-She showered yet, Shane?
-Yes, Ray.

07:56.200 --> 07:58.200
We bathe her every day.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.480
Knock, knock.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.600
Margot, where's Gwen?

08:12.720 --> 08:14.540
Edward, I thought.

08:14.640 --> 08:16.540
Edward!

08:16.640 --> 08:18.900
I thought you were different,
Edward,

08:19.000 --> 08:24.060
but you are just like every
other man I've ever known.

08:24.160 --> 08:28.380
Like every other man I've known
but you're...

08:28.480 --> 08:31.760
But you're just like
every other...

08:37.920 --> 08:40.640
Baby! Oh, hello.

08:42.040 --> 08:43.860
Oh, shit! Oh, my God!

08:43.960 --> 08:45.140
-Stop! That's my baby!
-Stop!

08:45.240 --> 08:47.060
-That's my baby!
-For God's sake!

08:47.160 --> 08:48.580
What the hell
is wrong with you?!

08:48.680 --> 08:50.740
-Are you insane?
-Hey, stop. Stop, stop.

08:50.840 --> 08:52.780
-What is wrong with her?
-Gwen, it's all OK.

08:52.880 --> 08:55.020
-Calm down.
-Don't tell me to calm down!

08:55.120 --> 08:57.460
-She has an illness.
-I don't care, it's a child!

08:57.560 --> 08:59.380
Come on, I know. We're going.

08:59.480 --> 09:01.340
Oh, God,
it's Gwendolyn Reed.

09:01.440 --> 09:03.820
Come with me.
We'll go and get warm, eh?

09:03.920 --> 09:06.220
-I just want to go home.
-We're going home now.

09:06.320 --> 09:08.420
We'll go home
and put on a cuppa, eh?

09:08.520 --> 09:09.860
Who are you?

09:09.960 --> 09:12.400
I'm a very good friend
of your father's.

09:15.280 --> 09:17.860
Much happier in here.
-This isn't my home.

09:17.960 --> 09:20.020
No, Gwen, we're just going to
visit some friends...

09:20.120 --> 09:23.460
You lied to me.
You said we were going home.

09:23.560 --> 09:26.420
-Gwen! Thank goodness.
-I don't belong in this place.

09:26.520 --> 09:28.860
-What is this place?
-I'll bring in a cuppa...

09:28.960 --> 09:31.060
-No, no, stop it. No, stop it!
-We'll give you something to...

09:31.160 --> 09:33.660
-No, no, no, no!
-You'll be fine.

09:33.760 --> 09:36.780
No, let go of me! No, no, no!

09:36.880 --> 09:39.220
-It's alright. It's OK.
-No! No!

09:39.320 --> 09:42.220
-No, stop it! Stop it, no!
-It's alright.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.260
No, no, no, no, no!

09:44.360 --> 09:46.880
-Let me go! Let me go!

10:29.760 --> 10:31.760
Mmm.

10:32.760 --> 10:34.760
Mmm!

10:42.480 --> 10:44.640
Mmm.

10:46.720 --> 10:48.740
-Oh!
-These are so good.

10:48.840 --> 10:51.260
These are...so, so good.

10:51.360 --> 10:53.260
You could do a bit
more in terms of selection

10:53.360 --> 10:55.140
but when they're this bloody
good, why the hell not?

10:55.240 --> 10:57.260
OK, you need to leave.

10:57.360 --> 10:59.460
-You made these.
-Yeah.

10:59.560 --> 11:01.500
-They're spectacular.
-Thank you.

11:01.600 --> 11:02.740
-They are exceptional.
-Um...

11:02.840 --> 11:05.340
They're not that hard to make,
actually.

11:05.440 --> 11:07.440
I don't believe that.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.260
Listen to me.

11:10.360 --> 11:12.360
There is beauty here.

11:14.240 --> 11:17.220
There is real beauty here.

11:17.320 --> 11:18.820
There's a...

11:18.920 --> 11:20.980
..a love...

11:21.080 --> 11:23.080
..in this chicken pie.

11:25.080 --> 11:27.340
I feel like I can...

11:27.440 --> 11:30.240
..I can taste your heart.

11:31.360 --> 11:33.360
Oh, Jesus.

11:50.040 --> 11:52.040
Ow!

11:59.440 --> 12:02.140
Oh!

12:02.240 --> 12:04.660
Wait.

12:04.760 --> 12:06.660
Who are you?

12:06.760 --> 12:08.660
I'm Sam.

12:08.760 --> 12:11.240
Just Sam.

12:37.560 --> 12:39.560
Honey?

12:51.920 --> 12:53.920
My sweet girl.

12:55.160 --> 12:57.160
My beautiful girl.

12:58.080 --> 13:00.080
Hey?

13:04.800 --> 13:08.180
She could have eaten something
from the garden. I don't know.

13:08.280 --> 13:13.060
15. Arthritis everywhere,
almost blind.

13:13.160 --> 13:17.160
No, that won't... that won't do.
You need to come here today.

13:18.360 --> 13:21.500
No, she won't last that long.

13:24.240 --> 13:26.520
Don't worry, that won't work.

13:28.320 --> 13:30.560
Thanks.

13:40.160 --> 13:42.940
Max?

13:43.040 --> 13:45.040
Max?

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Max?

14:13.720 --> 14:15.720
Max?

14:19.200 --> 14:20.740
Hey.

14:20.840 --> 14:23.580
Who the hell
did you think I was?

14:23.680 --> 14:26.420
Thief. Mormons.

14:26.520 --> 14:28.300
Nearly shat myself.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.400
Mate!

14:31.960 --> 14:34.180
I need a favour.

14:34.280 --> 14:36.880
You're holding it.

14:43.400 --> 14:46.260
I'll get her
and bring her outside.

14:46.360 --> 14:48.360
Honey!

14:52.440 --> 14:55.880
Girl! Where are you?
Come on, girl.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.240
Honey?

15:04.320 --> 15:07.260
Don't know where she is.

15:07.360 --> 15:09.360
We done here?

15:10.240 --> 15:12.240
Guess so.

15:33.760 --> 15:38.100
Oh, my God, I'm awful!

15:38.200 --> 15:42.560
Oh! I've never done
anything like this.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
What?

15:47.880 --> 15:49.260
What is it? Are you...

15:49.360 --> 15:51.620
-Are you hurt?
-No.

15:51.720 --> 15:53.340
No, it's...

15:53.440 --> 15:55.420
It's just...

15:55.520 --> 15:57.500
..the ecstasy of us.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.940
-You're messing with me.
-No, hey.

16:00.040 --> 16:02.180
Hey, hey, Karen. Karen.

16:02.280 --> 16:03.780
That was...

16:03.880 --> 16:06.900
I am not Karen.
I'm her sister Tina.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.700
Karen died.

16:08.800 --> 16:12.000
-How'd she die?
-In the flood. She...

16:13.520 --> 16:15.220
She was one of the five.

16:15.320 --> 16:17.520
-Oh, that... that sucks.
-Yep.

16:22.160 --> 16:24.200
Look what I found.

16:25.520 --> 16:28.680
Ahh! Who's this?

16:31.800 --> 16:33.660
That's...

16:33.760 --> 16:35.460
..no-one.

16:56.720 --> 16:58.620
You have to go.

17:08.960 --> 17:11.960
I was... doing Zumba.

17:33.360 --> 17:35.360
Hey!

17:39.400 --> 17:41.140
Come on, come on.

17:41.240 --> 17:44.180
Alright, come on. Move up, girl.

17:44.280 --> 17:48.120
Keep going. Keep going.

19:10.640 --> 19:12.920
Those pricks.

19:42.200 --> 19:46.840
It's OK. Here I am.

19:56.800 --> 19:59.220
Isaac.

19:59.320 --> 20:02.940
Oh, I'm so relieved
to see you here.

20:03.040 --> 20:06.480
We could both use the comfort,
couldn't we?

20:07.880 --> 20:10.500
So much life ahead of you

20:10.600 --> 20:12.500
and so intelligent,

20:12.600 --> 20:15.520
even with
your challenging upbringing.

20:17.200 --> 20:19.380
But you must be asking why.

20:19.480 --> 20:24.420
Why would He bring
this devastation on us?

20:24.520 --> 20:29.820
You losing your mother,
me losing my beautiful brother.

20:29.920 --> 20:32.000
But I know why.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.640
He chose the very best angels.

20:37.760 --> 20:40.700
Let's pray to God for that.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.800
God can go to hell.

20:45.720 --> 20:47.820
Isaac...

20:47.920 --> 20:50.040
Oh, Isaac!

20:55.840 --> 20:58.020
Look what I found -

20:58.120 --> 21:01.540
a box of memories tucked
up the back of the cupboard.

21:01.640 --> 21:04.160
So we didn't lose everything.

21:05.400 --> 21:07.520
And look at this.

21:09.760 --> 21:11.980
Look.

21:12.080 --> 21:14.860
From your first big role -
River Swan.

21:14.960 --> 21:17.400
Do you remember how beautiful
you were in that?

21:18.480 --> 21:20.620
Everyone loved you.

21:20.720 --> 21:22.720
Should we hang it here?

21:24.840 --> 21:28.180
Let's have a look
through these, hey?

21:28.280 --> 21:30.380
What have we got here?

21:30.480 --> 21:32.160
Hey?

21:34.080 --> 21:36.080
Let's see.

21:36.760 --> 21:38.660
There's...

21:38.760 --> 21:42.100
Here's your mum and your dad
on a big ship,

21:42.200 --> 21:44.180
and that's you.

21:49.680 --> 21:52.660
Oh, and this is you blowing them
away with your talent

21:52.760 --> 21:54.820
when you were still at school -
look at you.

21:54.920 --> 21:57.160
Hey

22:01.000 --> 22:02.860
And then...

22:02.960 --> 22:04.820
And then who's that

22:04.920 --> 22:06.380
Not bitter old Max?

22:06.480 --> 22:09.360
Jeez, the years
haven't been kind to him.

22:11.400 --> 22:12.860
Oh!

22:12.960 --> 22:15.380
And here we are in Melbourne.

22:15.480 --> 22:19.940
And that's me.
Didn't look too bad then, did I?

22:20.040 --> 22:23.180
-My star man.
-Yes!

22:23.280 --> 22:25.840
Your star man, and here I am.

22:29.680 --> 22:32.220
Alfie.

22:32.320 --> 22:34.780
Alfie?

22:34.880 --> 22:38.080
When's Alfie coming?

22:40.080 --> 22:42.080
He can't come today.

22:50.160 --> 22:53.420
And there's...
Here's one of us when we...

22:53.520 --> 22:57.020
-No, no, no, no, no, no.
-..when we first met.

22:57.120 --> 22:58.580
-No, no.
-OK.

22:58.680 --> 23:00.380
-No.
-Look, maybe tomorrow.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.060
-No.
-We'll look at more tomorrow.

23:02.160 --> 23:04.160
No, no.

23:28.760 --> 23:32.380
Hello? This is Max McKinnon.

23:32.480 --> 23:33.900
Mm-hm.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.900
Yeah. Um...

23:37.000 --> 23:40.240
What's your best price
for 51 head?

23:43.680 --> 23:45.940
Yeah.

23:46.040 --> 23:48.480
All solid, beautiful stock.

23:51.640 --> 23:53.640
OK.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.220
I know how unfair this is.

24:18.320 --> 24:21.580
With early-onset Alzheimer's,
the decline is much more rapid.

24:21.680 --> 24:24.180
Her adult memories
are the first to go.

24:24.280 --> 24:26.700
The reality is,
we're semi-secure.

24:26.800 --> 24:29.260
She needs high care.

24:29.360 --> 24:31.940
But if her early memories
are all that she has,

24:32.040 --> 24:33.820
then why move her?

24:33.920 --> 24:36.500
I mean, she knows this town.
That's why we came back.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.340
That other place
is an hour away.

24:38.440 --> 24:40.580
If she suddenly needs me,
I gotta be able...

24:40.680 --> 24:42.660
This has to be
what's best for her.

24:42.760 --> 24:44.300
Margot...

24:44.400 --> 24:46.260
..I am what's best for her.

24:46.360 --> 24:48.360
I'm what's best.

24:50.160 --> 24:52.860
I'll get someone in to help,
hey?

24:52.960 --> 24:54.860
I'll pay. You just tell me
what she needs.

24:54.960 --> 24:57.100
Ray, it's not about money.

24:57.200 --> 25:00.940
Look at us.
This place is not for her.

25:01.040 --> 25:04.180
And you need to take care
of yourself for a change.

25:04.280 --> 25:07.840
Go on holiday. Get away
from this town for a bit.

26:38.360 --> 26:41.460
Vivian!

26:41.560 --> 26:43.640
Vivian.

26:45.800 --> 26:47.380
Loris.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.100
What a surprise to see you.

26:49.200 --> 26:51.260
Yeah, well, there's still
a lot to get ready, Vivian,

26:51.360 --> 26:53.420
and I can see
you're still at it.

26:53.520 --> 26:55.860
-Final touches, that's all.
-May I?

26:55.960 --> 26:59.220
30 tonight.

26:59.320 --> 27:02.340
Excuse me,
I really need to see it to...

27:02.440 --> 27:04.540
..well, quite frankly,
to approve it.

27:04.640 --> 27:05.620
No, you really don't.

27:05.720 --> 27:08.020
The council gave me
full artistic licence.

27:08.120 --> 27:09.780
Oh, now I'm even more concerned.

27:09.880 --> 27:11.500
Everybody's on tenterhooks

27:11.600 --> 27:14.740
and we need something delicate,
something...

27:14.840 --> 27:16.540
..something respectful.

27:16.640 --> 27:18.860
-Hey, Isaac.
-Isaac!

27:18.960 --> 27:21.500
Stop! What are you bloody doing?

27:21.600 --> 27:23.780
She is not deceased.
She is missing.

27:23.880 --> 27:26.860
Isaac, please stop. Stop.

27:26.960 --> 27:29.500
How long has it been

27:29.600 --> 27:31.100
Because it's...

27:31.200 --> 27:35.400
Because this needs to stop
for your own sake.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.540
Isaac.

27:42.640 --> 27:44.640
Please.

27:45.240 --> 27:47.240
Isaac!

29:11.920 --> 29:15.320
Look who it is, eh?
Mr Happy Snaps.

29:20.120 --> 29:22.220
-Cool hideout.
-What are you doing here?

29:22.320 --> 29:25.500
I used to come down
to this river as a kid.

29:25.600 --> 29:29.520
My dad used to take me
camping and fishing.

29:33.240 --> 29:35.240
I'm Sam.

29:35.640 --> 29:37.940
I'm a visitor.

29:38.040 --> 29:41.460
You really are the town spy,
huh? I love it.

29:41.560 --> 29:43.560
It's creepy.

29:46.680 --> 29:49.140
So, like...

29:49.240 --> 29:50.540
..what's wrong with ya?

29:50.640 --> 29:54.020
-What do you mean?
-I mean, like, mentally.

29:54.120 --> 29:58.100
Mentally I have 160 IQ, which is
inherited from my mother

29:58.200 --> 30:01.260
and possibly
my sperm donor father.

30:01.360 --> 30:02.500
Really?

30:02.600 --> 30:04.660
So your mum doesn't have a man?

30:04.760 --> 30:06.980
No, a wife.

30:07.080 --> 30:08.540
My other mum.

30:08.640 --> 30:11.140
You got two mums, eh?
Wow, that's...

30:11.240 --> 30:13.500
Well, you know, you see that
sort of thing a lot nowadays.

30:13.600 --> 30:16.420
It's very common.
Very common.

30:16.520 --> 30:18.740
I will admit that in my youth it
would have raised an eyebrow or two,

30:18.840 --> 30:19.620
myself included.

30:19.720 --> 30:21.500
But now that I'm older,
I think you know,

30:21.600 --> 30:23.580
what do I care if two sheilas
want to munch carpet?

30:23.680 --> 30:25.680
Who wouldn't, eh?

30:28.520 --> 30:31.220
What do you do round here
for fun

30:31.320 --> 30:34.320
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

30:35.360 --> 30:37.360
You like cars?

30:40.680 --> 30:43.700
Alright. Here we are -
Uncle Charlie's.

30:43.800 --> 30:46.400
He said I could borrow his car
anytime I liked.

30:47.880 --> 30:49.880
We're old mates.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Leave your bike.

30:56.240 --> 30:58.940
Shouldn't we ask him?

30:59.040 --> 31:01.820
Yeah, nah. I don't want
to bother him.

31:01.920 --> 31:06.700
-He's got the big C, so...
-Is it pancreatic?

31:06.800 --> 31:08.820
-What?
-The big C is cancer.

31:08.920 --> 31:11.500
So if it's pancreatic,
the mortality rate is 94%

31:11.600 --> 31:12.540
over a five-year period.

31:12.640 --> 31:14.900
-Yeah, nah. It's not that one.
-Is he a smoker?

31:15.000 --> 31:16.740
-If so, the risk...
-No, mate, he doesn't smoke.

31:16.840 --> 31:18.780
Look, I need you to stay here.

31:18.880 --> 31:20.980
And if you see anything,

31:21.080 --> 31:22.300
you let me know.

31:22.400 --> 31:24.400
OK.

31:27.120 --> 31:30.820
The national anthem of Mexico.

31:55.360 --> 31:57.360
Ah.

32:50.520 --> 32:52.560
Come on, Zacky.
Chop-chop, let's go.

32:55.360 --> 32:57.580
Hey, look -
there's Uncle Charlie.

32:57.680 --> 33:00.020
Yep. Uncle Charlie's
taking a nap.

33:01.800 --> 33:03.840
What about my bike?

33:17.680 --> 33:19.140
Hey what about your bike?

33:19.240 --> 33:21.560
I don't want my bike.
That's a girl's bike.

33:34.280 --> 33:35.780
Ahh.

33:35.880 --> 33:37.880
Now, that...

33:38.880 --> 33:40.880
That's a good tipple.

33:44.120 --> 33:47.980
-It's a blend, actually.
-Hey?

33:48.080 --> 33:52.820
It says "Scotch" but it's made
in Tasmania, not Scotland.

33:52.920 --> 33:55.120
So technically this is a fraud.

33:56.320 --> 33:59.040
Maybe you should just try it.

34:03.560 --> 34:05.700
Mate.

34:07.840 --> 34:09.840
That'll put some hairs
on your nuts.

34:11.960 --> 34:14.700
How old are you, anyway - 12.

34:14.800 --> 34:16.460
Right. Well, I'm twenty...

34:16.560 --> 34:18.560
..six.

34:28.480 --> 34:30.140
What, you want one?

34:30.240 --> 34:32.520
No, thanks. Those will kill you.

34:34.120 --> 34:36.440
Yeah, I used to think that too.

34:38.600 --> 34:40.800
But you know what I learned?

34:42.520 --> 34:45.120
There are no consequences.

34:46.920 --> 34:49.340
Good or bad -
doesn't matter what you do.

34:49.440 --> 34:51.440
There's no karma.

34:52.040 --> 34:54.120
No giant lightning bolt.

34:55.240 --> 34:57.240
There's zip.

34:59.480 --> 35:01.480
You can do...

35:02.200 --> 35:03.980
..anything you want.

35:04.080 --> 35:06.460
No. That's not true.

35:06.560 --> 35:09.940
My mother was a nurse.
She was always helping people.

35:10.040 --> 35:11.940
Now she's missing.

35:12.040 --> 35:13.580
Missing

35:13.680 --> 35:16.680
Missing, as in
not found since the flood.

35:20.120 --> 35:22.060
Mate, the flood was, like,
a year ago.

35:22.160 --> 35:24.460
She's alive.

35:24.560 --> 35:26.740
The odds are stacked against
you, that's all I'm saying.

35:26.840 --> 35:29.680
-She's alive. I know it.
-Alright.

35:30.960 --> 35:32.960
I believe you.

35:34.640 --> 35:37.880
Vivian's constructed
a monument to her death.

35:41.080 --> 35:43.080
Who's Vivian?

35:44.160 --> 35:46.340
A year ago today,

35:46.440 --> 35:50.460
tragedy struck with no warning,

35:50.560 --> 35:54.300
no-one to blame.

35:54.400 --> 35:58.180
But we've all had to battle
our grief and rage

35:58.280 --> 36:01.200
over "Why us?"

36:02.480 --> 36:07.420
Life sometimes gives us
unexplained tragedies,

36:07.520 --> 36:11.860
but also miracles.

36:11.960 --> 36:16.060
And the healing power
of this community

36:16.160 --> 36:18.940
is one such miracle.

36:19.040 --> 36:21.580
And now I would like to
introduce

36:21.680 --> 36:25.700
our cherished local artist,
Vivian North,

36:25.800 --> 36:30.200
to unveil her special memorial.

36:31.240 --> 36:33.620
Which I have yet to see.

36:33.720 --> 36:34.900
Vivian.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.580
Hello there.
Thank you, Loris.

36:42.680 --> 36:45.740
Well, my challenge
was to create a piece

36:45.840 --> 36:48.340
to remind us all,

36:48.440 --> 36:50.540
despite what we've all lost,

36:50.640 --> 36:52.640
that although those...

36:53.720 --> 36:56.920
..missing mightn't be here...

36:57.920 --> 37:00.420
..they will always be with us,

37:00.520 --> 37:02.180
keeping us strong.

37:02.280 --> 37:05.160
That is why I was inspired by
a dove and an eagle.

37:06.400 --> 37:08.460
Or, as we could all call it,

37:08.560 --> 37:10.720
our 'deagle'.

37:19.360 --> 37:21.500
It looks like a bloody demon!

37:21.600 --> 37:23.660
Thank you, Viv.

37:23.760 --> 37:25.620
I'm Pat Nemaric,

37:25.720 --> 37:28.660
the mayor
of this beautiful town.

37:28.760 --> 37:32.780
And if you could all
now please...

37:32.880 --> 37:36.460
..to remember
our five family members

37:36.560 --> 37:38.900
taken from us.

37:39.000 --> 37:43.020
Father Brett Adelstone, age 65.

37:44.520 --> 37:49.080
Ranjeet Korrapati, 91.

37:50.480 --> 37:54.680
Annie Langlan, 44.

37:56.880 --> 38:00.240
Karen Riley, 32.

38:02.080 --> 38:04.380
And Alfie Thomas,

38:04.480 --> 38:06.840
aged only 11.

38:13.280 --> 38:15.360
Stay back! Stay back!

38:31.120 --> 38:33.940
Do you see it?
It's still there.

38:34.040 --> 38:37.220
I can definitely see something.

38:37.320 --> 38:39.140
Well, you'll know
when you see it.

38:39.240 --> 38:41.020
Oh, God.

38:41.120 --> 38:42.660
Oh, my God, it's...

38:42.760 --> 38:44.780
-It's fireflies!
-That's it.

38:44.880 --> 38:47.620
Pleiades, 420 light-years away.

38:47.720 --> 38:49.340
Wow, it's beautiful.

38:49.440 --> 38:52.020
-Imagine when we're in Mullan.
-What do you mean?

38:52.120 --> 38:55.820
Well, you know, all that
open space, open sky.

38:55.920 --> 38:58.480
We are in Mullan, Gwen.

39:02.360 --> 39:04.060
I knew that. We...

39:04.160 --> 39:06.220
We're in Mullan.
We are in Mullan now.

39:06.320 --> 39:09.340
-We're in Mull...
-Yeah. You're just tired.

39:09.440 --> 39:11.800
-Forgot.

39:13.640 --> 39:15.820
We came here...

39:15.920 --> 39:17.860
Last year, in the summer.

39:17.960 --> 39:20.020
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

39:20.120 --> 39:22.540
-I knew that, I knew that.
-Yeah.

39:22.640 --> 39:25.320
-I knew that.
-That's why I'm here!

39:26.600 --> 39:28.600
I forgot.

40:03.160 --> 40:05.160
Knock, knock.

40:08.880 --> 40:10.880
Gwen?

41:12.440 --> 41:14.940
Yeah, a lot of farmers
selling up.

41:15.040 --> 41:18.060
Too bloody hard.

41:18.160 --> 41:20.100
Least it's good
for the price of beef, hey?

41:20.200 --> 41:23.360
Hey! Not that one!

41:26.520 --> 41:28.460
She's pregnant.

41:28.560 --> 41:30.560
Not for sale.

41:33.040 --> 41:35.040
Come on, girl.

41:35.960 --> 41:37.960
Come on.

41:40.320 --> 41:42.560
Alright, don't worry.
Yeah, yeah.

42:57.920 --> 43:00.000
What the hell?

43:13.760 --> 43:15.760
That's about right.

43:18.720 --> 43:23.000
Get out of the car now.
Put your hands on your head.

43:25.600 --> 43:27.020
-Is there a problem?
-Yeah.

43:27.120 --> 43:29.500
Your little nudie run
down Main Street the other day,

43:29.600 --> 43:31.020
the stolen vehicle here

43:31.120 --> 43:32.820
and its owner
you left for dead, mate.

43:32.920 --> 43:34.340
I'd say we do have a problem.

43:34.440 --> 43:37.100
-Fair enough.
-Put your hands on the bonnet.

43:37.200 --> 43:39.520
Put your hands on the bonnet!

43:50.240 --> 43:52.640
Spread your legs.

43:57.440 --> 43:59.560
What was that, mate?

44:01.120 --> 44:02.900
That's just embarrassing,
isn't it?

44:19.880 --> 44:23.100
I really don't...
I don't feel too good, eh.

44:23.200 --> 44:24.420
Yeah?

44:24.520 --> 44:27.560
Well, you'll have the night to
perk up, then. Won't you, mate?

44:32.680 --> 44:34.720
No wonder your missus wanted it.

44:36.520 --> 44:39.180
-What'd you say?
-Oh, yeah.

44:39.280 --> 44:42.020
She was ready to erupt.

44:42.120 --> 44:44.520
Sweeter than
one of her custard tarts.

44:48.320 --> 44:50.480
Really?

44:51.960 --> 44:53.960
Is that all you got?

45:49.560 --> 45:51.340
Gwen, love.

45:51.440 --> 45:54.020
Gwen.

45:54.120 --> 45:56.060
It's Ray.

45:56.160 --> 45:58.520
Your star man.

45:59.640 --> 46:02.120
I've got something for you.

46:03.320 --> 46:06.060
It's a medicine.

46:06.160 --> 46:08.160
Make you feel better.

46:12.920 --> 46:14.920
There you go.

46:17.400 --> 46:20.080
It's OK.

46:24.440 --> 46:26.440
That's good.

46:28.240 --> 46:30.400
That's good.

47:50.360 --> 47:52.920
Gwen? Good morning.

47:54.960 --> 47:57.200
Gwen?

48:58.560 --> 49:00.300
Hello?

49:00.400 --> 49:02.740
Margot.

49:02.840 --> 49:04.840
When?

49:17.440 --> 49:19.440
Oh...

49:23.640 --> 49:25.640
Oh.

49:26.800 --> 49:28.800
Fuck!
