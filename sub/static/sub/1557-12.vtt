00:12.946 --> 00:15.280
Phil, honey!

00:15.348 --> 00:16.782
Phil!

00:16.850 --> 00:18.550
Hey, check it out.

00:18.618 --> 00:20.519
Grandpa sent us another
postcard from his RV trip.

00:20.587 --> 00:21.820
"Mount Rushmore?

00:21.888 --> 00:24.356
I wish the tour guide
would have rushed more."

00:24.424 --> 00:25.691
Phil, we have got to do something

00:25.759 --> 00:26.859
about Amber and Ronnie's boat.

00:26.926 --> 00:28.193
That thing is making it impossible

00:28.261 --> 00:30.796
to park in our driveway,
and it's an eyesore.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.131
On the other hand, they're our neighbors

00:32.198 --> 00:33.298
and we have to see them everyday.

00:33.366 --> 00:34.967
I worry about... rocking the boat.

00:35.034 --> 00:36.535
You know you can do better.

00:36.603 --> 00:37.870
Keeping me honest. I love it.

00:37.937 --> 00:40.205
Yeah, the boat is trashy.

00:40.273 --> 00:42.541
Living next to it doesn't
feel "on brand" for me.

00:42.609 --> 00:45.010
You know, with sea levels
rising at their current rate,

00:45.078 --> 00:46.812
we should be glad we live near a boat.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.481
Okay, so, that's three
for "get rid of the boat."

00:49.549 --> 00:50.482
- Luke?
- Count me out.

00:50.550 --> 00:51.550
This isn't a police state.

00:51.618 --> 00:53.786
That boat isn't hurting anyone.

00:54.153 --> 00:56.455
Here's all you need to
know about that boat.

00:56.653 --> 00:59.321
One... Tammy LaFontaine sunbathes on it.

00:59.389 --> 01:04.393
Two... my eyeballs like looking
at Tammy LaFontaine sunbathing.

01:04.459 --> 01:05.627
Don't make me the bad guy here.

01:05.695 --> 01:07.863
You know that obnoxious
thing annoys you, too.

01:07.931 --> 01:09.531
Yeah, it does, but we
need to finesse this...

01:09.599 --> 01:10.532
be nice about it.

01:10.600 --> 01:11.667
The last thing we need

01:11.734 --> 01:13.268
is some huge feud with our crazy neighbors.

01:13.336 --> 01:15.103
- Movie idea.
- I'll put on the list.

01:15.171 --> 01:17.205
- Comedy or drama?
- Depends on casting.

01:17.273 --> 01:18.874
There's got to be some kind
of regulation about this.

01:18.942 --> 01:21.043
- I'm gonna call the city.
- That's a terrible idea.

01:21.110 --> 01:22.377
No, a terrible idea

01:22.445 --> 01:25.380
is a movie about a guy
who can fax himself places.

01:25.448 --> 01:28.050
'Cause you haven't heard the
title... "Just the fax man."

01:28.117 --> 01:29.384
Yeah.

01:29.452 --> 01:32.020
That water can't hit us soon enough.

01:46.549 --> 01:47.816
Mitchell: Hey, where have you guys been?

01:47.884 --> 01:49.651
Both: The San Vicente
branch of the public library,

01:49.719 --> 01:50.752
and then ice cream.

01:50.920 --> 01:53.422
That was a weirdly specific answer.

01:53.489 --> 01:55.324
Well, everything is normal.

01:55.391 --> 01:56.625
Usually when everything is normal,

01:56.693 --> 01:58.327
people don't respond in
perfectly rehearsed unison.

01:58.394 --> 02:00.128
Now who's being weirdly specific.

02:00.196 --> 02:02.130
Well, if you went to the library,

02:02.198 --> 02:03.198
why don't you have any books?

02:03.266 --> 02:04.232
We read there.

02:04.300 --> 02:05.467
I read "Clifford: The Big Red Dog."

02:05.535 --> 02:07.402
And I read Richard
Chamberlain's autobiography.

02:07.470 --> 02:09.571
Did you know he did Hamlet in London?

02:09.639 --> 02:11.606
Yes, I remember you telling me about that

02:11.674 --> 02:13.909
at the San Vicente branch
of the public library.

02:13.976 --> 02:15.577
Okay, well, why don't you go
clean your room now, sweetie?

02:15.645 --> 02:18.280
- Great idea.
- Lily, don't forget your backpack.

02:18.347 --> 02:20.148
Whoa, what's this?

02:20.216 --> 02:22.551
- Um...
- Cam, clown supplies?

02:22.618 --> 02:23.785
Yeah, those are mine.

02:23.853 --> 02:25.554
We just had to pick them
up from the dry cleaner.

02:25.621 --> 02:26.822
Also mine.

02:26.889 --> 02:30.959
My gosh, they must have
shrunk them in the wash!

02:31.027 --> 02:32.994
Did they wash them 40,000 times?

02:33.062 --> 02:34.095
Okay, look.

02:34.163 --> 02:36.198
It's no big deal, but I took Lily

02:36.265 --> 02:38.366
to a junior clown college this morning.

02:38.434 --> 02:40.302
Are you serious? Behind my back?

02:40.369 --> 02:41.636
Yes, because I knew you wouldn't approve.

02:41.704 --> 02:42.871
What was I supposed to do?

02:42.939 --> 02:44.673
Not take her because you know how I feel

02:44.740 --> 02:45.974
about all this mumbo jumbo.

02:46.042 --> 02:47.108
Hey!

02:47.176 --> 02:49.344
Mumbo Jumbo was like a father to me.

02:49.412 --> 02:52.080
I have been very up front with you.

02:52.148 --> 02:55.984
You knew going in that I wanted
to raise our child as a clown.

02:56.052 --> 02:58.353
Yes, but then I finally
realized that you weren't joking

02:58.421 --> 02:59.854
and we agreed that we would wait

02:59.922 --> 03:01.890
until she was old enough
to decide for herself.

03:01.958 --> 03:03.525
You do stuff with her all the time,

03:03.592 --> 03:05.427
and you don't ask me for my permission.

03:05.494 --> 03:06.661
Just last week,

03:06.729 --> 03:08.496
you took her to the
doctor without even asking!

03:08.564 --> 03:10.198
'Cause she had an ear infection!

03:10.266 --> 03:11.966
Let's say we're even!

03:14.270 --> 03:15.737
Gloria: Bravo!

03:15.805 --> 03:18.073
You ate all of your blueberries!

03:18.140 --> 03:19.541
That gets applause?

03:19.608 --> 03:21.810
I just finished the Friday
crossword puzzle and nothing.

03:21.877 --> 03:23.978
I guess everyone knows
Herbert Hoover's middle name.

03:24.046 --> 03:25.146
Look what I got...

03:25.214 --> 03:28.450
a throne for our little king.

03:28.517 --> 03:30.118
Do we have to put the
toilet on the counter?

03:30.186 --> 03:31.553
I take my afternoon coffee here.

03:31.620 --> 03:33.388
Let's fix one problem at a time.

03:33.455 --> 03:35.190
I've decided to potty-train Joe.

03:35.257 --> 03:36.758
No, too soon.

03:36.825 --> 03:38.259
It's too soon for a Pearl Harbor joke,

03:38.327 --> 03:39.761
perfect time for this.

03:39.828 --> 03:41.563
I don't want to rush him.

03:41.630 --> 03:44.198
Too much pressure and
he will get traumatized.

03:44.266 --> 03:46.868
He's grown up drinking from
a breast bigger than his head.

03:46.936 --> 03:48.770
I don't think he scares easy.

03:48.837 --> 03:50.772
The kid's ready, plus, if I'm being honest,

03:50.839 --> 03:52.607
I'm tired of buying diapers.

03:53.175 --> 03:55.710
Excuse me, where do you keep the diapers?

03:55.778 --> 03:57.645
Right over here, sir.

04:02.618 --> 04:04.319
You trying to be funny?

04:04.386 --> 04:06.854
We have larger sizes.

04:08.323 --> 04:09.357
He's gonna do great.

04:09.425 --> 04:10.458
Why wouldn't he?

04:10.526 --> 04:12.393
There's no one better than Joe, right?

04:12.461 --> 04:13.728
<i>I'm better than Joe.</i>

04:13.796 --> 04:16.564
At his age, I was counting
to 10 in three languages.

04:16.632 --> 04:19.966
The bar is so low for that kid,
except when they play limbo.

04:20.035 --> 04:22.770
They hold it up so high
anybody can get under it.

04:22.838 --> 04:25.039
Hey.

04:25.107 --> 04:26.140
I didn't see you there.

04:27.176 --> 04:28.410
Really?

04:28.477 --> 04:30.078
So, is that your creepy twin brother

04:30.146 --> 04:31.179
who's been staring at me

04:31.247 --> 04:32.747
from the window for the last week?

04:32.815 --> 04:35.984
I could lie and say "yes."

04:36.051 --> 04:37.986
You could pretend you weren't flattered,

04:38.053 --> 04:39.788
but why not just cut to the chase?

04:39.855 --> 04:41.189
And what would that be?

04:41.257 --> 04:45.093
Um... I could maybe
touch something of yours?

04:45.161 --> 04:47.428
Sure, and I could maybe
kick something of yours.

04:47.496 --> 04:49.063
I like this tension.

04:49.131 --> 04:51.166
Very "will they, when will they?"

04:51.233 --> 04:52.567
Go back to your room, little boy.

04:52.635 --> 04:54.302
Got it. I'll see you from there.

04:55.671 --> 04:56.838
Once we approach them with this,

04:56.906 --> 04:58.072
it's gonna be awfully hard for me to log in

04:58.140 --> 04:59.908
with my anonymous call to the city.

04:59.975 --> 05:01.876
You're not gonna have to report anyone.

05:01.944 --> 05:03.177
Call me David Copperfield,

05:03.245 --> 05:05.313
'cause I'm about to make a boat disappear.

05:05.381 --> 05:08.449
Hey, neighbors. I made
you some banana bread.

05:08.517 --> 05:10.251
- Hey!
- I love banana bread.

05:10.319 --> 05:12.820
We have this at our dispensary,
except we got weed in it.

05:12.888 --> 05:15.256
Ooh, but we could give this
one to our kids as a trick.

05:16.458 --> 05:18.326
This boat is really something.

05:18.394 --> 05:19.627
You know what we call her?

05:19.695 --> 05:21.929
- "Jackpot"!
- 'Cause you sell pot.

05:21.997 --> 05:24.699
Holy cow, we never thought of that.

05:24.767 --> 05:26.200
This is the best day of my life!

05:27.495 --> 05:29.630
Permission to come
aboard and check her out?

05:29.697 --> 05:31.098
Yeah!

05:31.165 --> 05:33.233
That is, if you're talking
about my boat and not my wife.

05:33.301 --> 05:36.003
Ooh, yeah, you can't climb aboard me.

05:36.070 --> 05:37.337
Well, not in the driveway, anyway.

05:37.405 --> 05:40.207
- This is so great.
- Claire: Yeah.

05:40.274 --> 05:41.541
Did you do something new with your hair?

05:41.609 --> 05:43.410
- Did you get a new wig- or something?
- Mnh-mnh.

05:43.478 --> 05:46.813
Sweet boat like this
belongs in the water, am I right?

05:46.881 --> 05:48.915
Well, you know, people who
put their boat in the water,

05:48.983 --> 05:50.217
they only use it on the weekend.

05:50.284 --> 05:52.085
We get to use this baby every day.

05:52.153 --> 05:53.220
Can you imagine

05:53.287 --> 05:55.622
visiting this boat every day in the marina?

05:55.690 --> 05:56.890
You spend a bunch of money on something,

05:56.958 --> 05:58.024
you want people to see it.

05:58.092 --> 05:59.626
That's why I wear low-cut tops.

05:59.694 --> 06:02.062
Yeah! Listen up.

06:02.130 --> 06:03.396
I just got to be honest.

06:03.464 --> 06:04.865
We're having a hard
time with the boat here.

06:06.521 --> 06:08.389
<i>What, you don't like Jackpot?</i>

06:08.457 --> 06:10.925
It's gigantic and makes it pretty tough

06:10.992 --> 06:12.860
to park in our driveway.

06:12.928 --> 06:15.729
<i>Well, that's because you open
your doors onto our driveway,</i>

06:15.797 --> 06:17.465
<i>where we keep our boat.</i>

06:17.532 --> 06:20.901
Yes, and, according to city regulations,

06:20.969 --> 06:22.369
it shouldn't even be here.

06:22.437 --> 06:24.171
"Regulations." Hear that?

06:24.239 --> 06:25.639
Look, we really do want
to keep this friendly.

06:25.707 --> 06:27.441
And it's been here for three weeks.

06:27.509 --> 06:29.743
- Yeah, and it's beautiful.
- And it's tacky.

06:29.811 --> 06:31.478
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:31.546 --> 06:32.546
- Settle down!
- Hey, that is uncool!

06:32.614 --> 06:34.815
There are four aces on the side of it.

06:34.883 --> 06:35.983
You know what?

06:36.051 --> 06:37.518
We're gonna have to ask you to disembark.

06:37.585 --> 06:39.320
That's boat for "get off."

06:39.387 --> 06:42.589
Yeah, there's no room up
here for an uptight buzzkill.

06:42.657 --> 06:43.924
Don't call her a buzzkill.

06:43.992 --> 06:45.259
That's right. There's a lot
of people who think I'm fun.

06:45.327 --> 06:46.894
You complain about fireworks Friday,

06:46.962 --> 06:49.663
you complain when my son
plays his kick-ass drum set,

06:49.731 --> 06:51.365
you bought curtains
for your bedroom window.

06:51.433 --> 06:53.767
What have we ever done to you?

06:53.835 --> 06:55.736
I think you just answered
your own question.

06:55.804 --> 06:56.904
All right, you know what?

06:56.971 --> 06:58.439
Here, take your buzz-free banana bread

06:58.506 --> 07:00.174
- and go back to your precious driveway.
- With pleasure.

07:00.241 --> 07:02.142
By the way, Claire, earlier,
I was just being nice.

07:02.210 --> 07:03.911
<i>I do not like your new wig.</i>

07:03.978 --> 07:06.213
Hey, what you don't like is her real hair!

07:06.281 --> 07:07.881
- Phil!
- Not the color.

07:07.949 --> 07:09.016
Hey, Phil!

07:10.819 --> 07:12.286
Still think we need to be nice?

07:12.353 --> 07:14.254
No. It's time for more drastic measures.

07:14.322 --> 07:17.624
No one insults... my banana bread.

07:25.993 --> 07:28.394
Mitchell. F... Fiz... no! No!

07:28.462 --> 07:30.162
What have I said about
you sneaking up on me?

07:30.230 --> 07:31.397
I could have been shaving.

07:31.465 --> 07:32.498
This could have been a Sweeney Todd moment.

07:32.566 --> 07:35.534
Because of me, clowning is in Lily's blood.

07:35.602 --> 07:36.183
Adopted.

07:36.184 --> 07:38.184
But she's a natural, and
we're gonna prove it to you.

07:38.205 --> 07:42.253
If she doesn't make you laugh,
she'll quit clowning forever.

07:42.261 --> 07:42.475
Come on.

07:42.542 --> 07:44.543
Please.

07:44.611 --> 07:48.280
I present to you the
Asian for any occasion,

07:48.348 --> 07:50.883
the clown that will invert that frown,

07:50.951 --> 07:54.386
the dynamic duo of Fizbo and...

07:54.454 --> 07:57.089
Lizbo!

07:57.157 --> 07:58.224
Are you not hearing that?

07:58.291 --> 08:00.025
We're working on the name.

08:00.093 --> 08:01.026
Ha!

08:01.094 --> 08:01.994
Ho!

08:02.062 --> 08:04.597
No, Fizbo dropped his hat.

08:04.664 --> 08:07.032
Where did it go, Lizbo?

08:07.100 --> 08:08.167
It's right there.

08:08.234 --> 08:09.802
There it is!

08:11.171 --> 08:12.471
Do, do-do-do-do, do, do, do.

08:12.539 --> 08:14.606
No, Fizbo! No!

08:14.674 --> 08:17.476
What? I'm just putting
my hat back on, Lizbo.

08:17.544 --> 08:19.645
My

08:19.713 --> 08:21.880
Confetti... I hope Fizbo
knows how to vacuum.

08:21.948 --> 08:24.950
Who turned out the lights?!

08:25.018 --> 08:26.718
You're just spreading it around.

08:30.623 --> 08:33.058
Mitchell: I tried to
be supportive for Lily.

08:33.126 --> 08:35.961
I really did, but I wanted to kill myself.

08:45.357 --> 08:47.291
That's not part of the routine.

08:48.760 --> 08:50.361
Wah, wah!

08:51.496 --> 08:53.764
She's a natural. Do it again.

08:58.679 --> 09:00.113
Okay, here we go. Nothing to it.

09:02.332 --> 09:03.599
Make it rain.

09:05.066 --> 09:06.333
Yeah, I... I get it.

09:06.400 --> 09:08.135
You... you can't pee with
another guy looking at you.

09:08.202 --> 09:09.603
Not a bad thing, by the way.

09:12.206 --> 09:15.375
Son of a gun, his middle name was Clark.

09:15.843 --> 09:17.611
- Jay!
- May we have some privacy, please?

09:17.678 --> 09:18.879
For what?

09:18.946 --> 09:21.781
So that Joe can keep chewing
on the electrical cord?

09:23.534 --> 09:25.402
O... we're... we're
not clapping for this?

09:25.535 --> 09:28.070
I told you that he was
not ready, and when he is,

09:28.137 --> 09:30.338
why don't you let his
mother take care of it?

09:30.406 --> 09:32.474
You know, I raised two
fully functional children.

09:32.542 --> 09:34.176
You have two kids that I don't know about?

09:34.243 --> 09:37.579
Please, just let Joe
go on his own schedule.

09:37.647 --> 09:40.615
Manny learned to potty-train
when he was 2 1/2.

09:41.552 --> 09:43.453
You told me it was 13 months.

09:43.521 --> 09:45.288
I may have exaggerated a little bit.

09:45.356 --> 09:47.557
2 1/2 isn't advanced at all.

09:47.875 --> 09:49.442
What else did you exaggerate?

09:49.510 --> 09:51.411
Did I really like Shakespeare when I was 3?

09:51.478 --> 09:53.246
Not so much Shakespeare as jello.

09:53.314 --> 09:55.114
Was my first word really "latte"?

09:55.182 --> 09:56.883
Not so much "latte" as "jello."

09:56.950 --> 09:58.651
My God. I'm normal.

09:58.719 --> 10:00.920
Trust me, kid, no one's
saying that about you.

10:00.988 --> 10:02.588
Why did you tell me all those things?

10:02.656 --> 10:03.756
To give you confidence.

10:03.824 --> 10:05.024
You needed it because you were having

10:05.092 --> 10:07.160
so much trouble learning how to read.

10:07.227 --> 10:08.528
This makes no sense.

10:08.595 --> 10:10.496
Yes, that what you always used to say.

10:14.516 --> 10:16.250
Aah!

10:16.318 --> 10:18.385
Wah, wah!

10:20.222 --> 10:21.489
Cameron: I wasn't deterred.

10:21.557 --> 10:23.925
I knew Lily had what it
took to be a great clown.

10:23.992 --> 10:25.560
I mean...

10:25.627 --> 10:27.461
she just needed to find her persona,

10:27.529 --> 10:31.666
and that process can be
painful, especially for me.

10:36.939 --> 10:38.973
Lily!

10:39.041 --> 10:40.942
Wah, wah!

10:43.178 --> 10:45.580
♪ Ba-da, ba, ba, ba, ba-ba... ♪

10:49.254 --> 10:51.455
Wah, wah!

10:54.145 --> 10:54.911
Good morning, neighbors.

10:55.238 --> 10:56.939
Beautiful day?

10:57.006 --> 10:59.174
Don't even try to sweet-talk us.

10:59.242 --> 11:01.143
This tacky boat ain't going anywhere.

11:02.478 --> 11:03.478
Hey, what's that?

11:03.546 --> 11:06.882
I don't know. What could it be?

11:11.287 --> 11:12.788
Phil is not a vindictive guy.

11:12.855 --> 11:14.523
He still listens to Milli Vanilli.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.124
It's a scandal I can dance to.

11:16.192 --> 11:18.293
But Ronnie and Amber
don't deserve Nice Phil.

11:18.361 --> 11:20.662
They dissed my woman, so
I called in the big guns.

11:20.730 --> 11:22.631
You are so sexy right now.

11:22.699 --> 11:25.667
- Girl, you know it's true.
- There it goes.

11:30.869 --> 11:32.069
Is that my son or am I looking

11:32.289 --> 11:34.042
in the world's most flattering mirror?

11:34.158 --> 11:36.326
That's funny and uplifting!

11:36.393 --> 11:37.427
- It is!
- Hi.

11:37.495 --> 11:39.778
Thanks for coming so fast.

11:39.789 --> 11:40.886
Where were you when we called?

11:40.899 --> 11:42.466
Who knows? It all looks the same.

11:42.534 --> 11:43.935
Either Arizona or New Mexico.

11:44.002 --> 11:45.236
Or maybe even regular Mexico.

11:45.304 --> 11:47.705
Thanks for coming, fellas.

11:47.773 --> 11:49.640
- Hey, guys.
- Grandpa!

11:49.708 --> 11:52.109
There's my little girls. How are you?

11:52.177 --> 11:53.377
Aww.

11:53.445 --> 11:54.645
What the hell is this?

11:54.713 --> 11:55.946
We see your driveway boat

11:56.014 --> 11:59.517
and raise you a convoy of retirees.

11:59.584 --> 12:01.285
I want to have three
more of your babies.

12:02.407 --> 12:04.241
How was your road trip?

12:04.309 --> 12:06.176
The highlight came in Branson, Missouri,

12:06.244 --> 12:09.613
when Victor rear-ended
Yakov Smirnoff's S.U.V.

12:09.681 --> 12:13.584
The exchange of information
was hilarious, but frustrating.

12:13.651 --> 12:15.419
I don't understand
anything that's happening.

12:15.487 --> 12:16.720
"In my country,

12:16.788 --> 12:18.822
car has insurance for me."

12:18.890 --> 12:20.324
That sort of thing.

12:20.391 --> 12:21.425
Just laugh.

12:21.492 --> 12:22.793
One day, we'll treasure these moments.

12:24.225 --> 12:25.626
I guess you guys convinced us.

12:25.693 --> 12:26.960
It's awesome having

12:27.028 --> 12:28.795
giant recreational
vehicles in your front yard.

12:29.998 --> 12:31.632
We see what you two are doing.

12:31.699 --> 12:32.966
You're gonna see a whole lot more,

12:33.034 --> 12:36.403
'cause these old guys like
to do tai chi in shorty robes.

12:36.471 --> 12:38.839
This ain't gonna work. I
like hanging with old people.

12:38.907 --> 12:40.340
Makes me feel in-shape.

12:40.408 --> 12:42.776
<i>They can't sleep and they can't hear.</i>

12:42.844 --> 12:44.911
They're gonna be blasting
talk radio all night long.

12:44.979 --> 12:47.848
When I get drunk, I snore real loud,

12:47.915 --> 12:49.850
so I won't hear a thing.

12:50.734 --> 12:51.901
We just wanted to give you a taste

12:51.969 --> 12:53.970
of what it's like to
have you for a neighbor.

12:54.038 --> 12:56.573
I love how close together
all our mouths are.

12:56.640 --> 12:57.974
Okay.

12:58.042 --> 12:59.742
Hey, dad, what's the...

12:59.810 --> 13:01.945
what's the plot of that
Rita Hayworth movie?

13:02.012 --> 13:03.580
My friends here were wondering.

13:03.647 --> 13:05.848
That's my cue. Time to help
my boy get rid of a boat.

13:05.916 --> 13:08.484
"Lady from Shanghai"?

13:08.552 --> 13:09.619
That's the one.

13:09.687 --> 13:11.554
I... I can't remember all the details.

13:11.622 --> 13:13.723
Pretty sure there was a horse in that movie.

13:13.791 --> 13:15.491
Or was it a baby?

13:15.559 --> 13:17.760
Funny thing... none of it was in Shanghai.

13:17.828 --> 13:20.029
Or was all of it in Shanghai?

13:20.097 --> 13:22.298
Anyway, where was I? Right.

13:22.366 --> 13:24.400
So, either the horse or this baby...

13:27.113 --> 13:28.072
Hey.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.602
I'm just putting these in the car.

13:29.821 --> 13:31.463
I help underprivileged kids lift weights.

13:31.682 --> 13:32.554
You can't even drive yet.

13:33.435 --> 13:35.618
Okay, you know my secret. What's yours?

13:36.384 --> 13:37.696
Do you honestly think
any of this is gonna work?

13:38.571 --> 13:41.739
I don't know what I'm doing.

13:41.807 --> 13:44.976
I... I have no clue what
to say when I'm around you,

13:45.044 --> 13:47.111
but I think about you all the time.

13:49.481 --> 13:52.984
Fine. Here's my secret.

13:54.353 --> 13:56.854
I put all these walls up and act tough,

13:56.922 --> 14:00.558
but... I've never really
been with a boy before.

14:00.626 --> 14:01.626
Really?

14:01.693 --> 14:03.394
Because I've never been with a girl.

14:03.462 --> 14:05.530
My God. Pathetic.

14:05.597 --> 14:07.298
Run home to your mommy, you little bitch.

14:13.423 --> 14:13.974
Is Lizbo in here?

14:14.190 --> 14:14.847
I think she's in our room.

14:15.442 --> 14:16.615
Cam.

14:17.644 --> 14:18.945
You know, you wouldn't be in this position

14:19.012 --> 14:20.146
if you hadn't gone behind my back.

14:20.214 --> 14:23.516
I wouldn't be in this position if I had...

14:24.284 --> 14:26.853
- ... a supportive husband.
- Okay.

14:26.920 --> 14:28.854
Really, I would love to
hear how this is my fault.

14:28.922 --> 14:31.190
Yesterday, Lily performed
her heart out for you.

14:31.258 --> 14:33.326
She was so excited to
do that broom routine,

14:33.393 --> 14:34.627
and you gave her nothing.

14:34.695 --> 14:36.896
So she got desperate,

14:36.964 --> 14:38.597
and she resorted to mean-spirited gags.

14:38.665 --> 14:40.199
And then all of a sudden, guess what.

14:40.267 --> 14:41.834
You're Mister McGiggles!

14:41.902 --> 14:43.135
Is he like an uncle to you?

14:44.137 --> 14:46.672
You know what hurt the
most is that my husband

14:46.740 --> 14:50.076
turned our daughter against
something that I love.

14:53.847 --> 14:56.215
Guys, we appreciate all your help,

14:56.283 --> 14:57.716
but you probably shouldn't be up there.

14:57.784 --> 14:58.851
I don't mind.

14:58.919 --> 14:59.952
Whoa!

15:00.020 --> 15:01.387
Is that weed I smell?

15:01.455 --> 15:03.155
Wait, you gave them pot?

15:03.223 --> 15:04.924
No, I run a legitimate business.

15:04.991 --> 15:06.225
I'm not gonna risk it for that.

15:06.293 --> 15:07.560
- They brought their own.
- Dad?

15:07.627 --> 15:10.029
- Not me, son.
- It's me and Victor.

15:10.096 --> 15:13.198
Makes my arthritis feel better.

15:13.266 --> 15:15.367
And I'm in remission... from being lame.

15:15.435 --> 15:17.503
Ronnie: Here's your beer, Frank.

15:17.571 --> 15:18.637
- Thank you, Ronnie.
- Right on.

15:18.705 --> 15:20.072
Here you go, guys. Pigs in a blanket.

15:20.140 --> 15:22.041
Thank you, darling.

15:22.108 --> 15:23.175
What are you guys doing?!

15:23.243 --> 15:24.843
You're supposed to be annoying them.

15:24.911 --> 15:26.345
These guys could never annoy me. What?

15:26.413 --> 15:28.414
Ronnie!

15:29.883 --> 15:32.251
Sorry, son, it turns out
Ronnie's a fellow army man.

15:32.318 --> 15:34.586
Plus, at our age, it's tough

15:34.654 --> 15:36.822
not to like someone who
pays attention to us.

15:36.890 --> 15:38.157
Unbelievable.

15:38.224 --> 15:40.993
I should have known better.
My dad's too loveable.

15:41.060 --> 15:43.162
It's always been his biggest flaw.

15:43.229 --> 15:45.164
Hey, smells like a party!

15:45.231 --> 15:47.232
- Back inside.
- Okay, then.

15:57.484 --> 15:59.890
♪ Take your body down to the potty ♪

16:00.109 --> 16:02.411
♪ to have some fun and go number one ♪

16:05.911 --> 16:07.311
What is this filth?

16:07.379 --> 16:10.014
I tried everything... videos,
books, parenting websites.

16:10.082 --> 16:11.982
I even tried to make a game out of it.

16:12.050 --> 16:14.251
Nothing could get that
kid to use the toilet.

16:14.319 --> 16:18.589
By the way, do not search
"peeing games" on the Internet.

16:18.657 --> 16:21.225
Okay, Joe, what's it gonna
be? I'm a wealthy man.

16:21.293 --> 16:22.359
Just give me a number.

16:22.427 --> 16:23.494
Seven.

16:23.562 --> 16:25.162
I just found out that's how old I was

16:25.230 --> 16:26.931
when I learned to tie my shoes.

16:26.998 --> 16:28.566
Not 2, like I was told.

16:28.633 --> 16:31.035
Okay, please, Manny.

16:31.102 --> 16:33.003
I might have exaggerated a little bit,

16:33.071 --> 16:35.139
but I do that all the time.

16:35.207 --> 16:37.508
Columbia actually is a very normal place.

16:37.576 --> 16:39.443
My accomplishments are all lies.

16:39.511 --> 16:42.046
I can only deal with one
traumatized child at a time.

16:42.113 --> 16:45.616
Please, Jay, let that
poor baby off the toilet.

16:45.684 --> 16:46.817
Okay, new plan...

16:46.885 --> 16:49.219
we leave him on the
throne till he conks out,

16:49.287 --> 16:51.789
then we dunk his hand in
a bowl of warm water...

16:52.413 --> 16:53.514
That's crazy.

16:53.581 --> 16:56.116
You know that you can't rush these things.

16:56.184 --> 16:59.219
You did it before with
Claire and with Mitch.

16:59.287 --> 17:00.988
I don't think he did, mom.

17:01.055 --> 17:02.623
Yes, he did, right?

17:02.690 --> 17:05.893
Well, I was a little busy
building a closet empire.

17:05.960 --> 17:08.328
And racquetball was pretty big back then.

17:08.396 --> 17:10.430
Maybe that's why this
is so important to you.

17:10.498 --> 17:12.499
You missed so many
milestones in their lives,

17:12.567 --> 17:14.434
you don't want to miss them with Joe.

17:14.502 --> 17:16.369
This is your second chance.

17:16.436 --> 17:18.872
But don't worry, Jay.
He knows you love him.

17:18.940 --> 17:21.942
I'd like him to remember
that I'm there for him.

17:23.566 --> 17:24.744
I mean, who knows if
I'll get another chance.

17:25.181 --> 17:26.385
I know. You won't.

17:27.587 --> 17:28.900
And he won't have to remember you

17:29.121 --> 17:30.982
because you're always going to be here.

17:31.197 --> 17:32.403
Aah. Forget it.

17:32.665 --> 17:34.066
Come on. Let's give it a rest.

17:34.133 --> 17:36.101
The poor kid... all that
pressure I put on him.

17:36.169 --> 17:38.170
Especially his bladder.

17:38.237 --> 17:40.272
You've probably got a gallon
of apple juice in there, buddy.

17:40.339 --> 17:42.274
Did you see that?

17:42.341 --> 17:44.443
Did you see how you understood Jay?

17:44.510 --> 17:46.845
That's what makes you so special.

17:46.913 --> 17:50.148
Anyone can learn how to
walk or pee in a potty.

17:50.216 --> 17:52.918
You're the most sensitive
and insightful person

17:52.985 --> 17:55.787
I have ever known, and
you have always been.

17:55.855 --> 17:57.489
Come here, papi.

17:57.557 --> 17:58.456
He's peeing!

17:58.524 --> 18:00.859
- He's peeing!
- My little genius!

18:00.927 --> 18:02.160
I knew you could do it, buddy!

18:02.228 --> 18:03.728
Ay, Jay, he's not done.

18:03.796 --> 18:05.530
Aw, hell. It's all over me.

18:05.598 --> 18:07.132
Would you take him?

18:12.388 --> 18:12.934
Lily!

18:13.151 --> 18:14.137
- It's you.
- Okay.

18:14.780 --> 18:15.436
Come here.
Come on.

18:15.542 --> 18:16.367
Let's have a little talk.

18:16.584 --> 18:19.317
All right, I know that I have been laughing

18:19.537 --> 18:20.958
at some of the stuff that
you've been doing to daddy,

18:21.068 --> 18:21.944
but I shouldn't have.

18:22.470 --> 18:24.176
I know that you love this,
but I don't want you to be

18:24.504 --> 18:25.816
the type of clown that hurts people.

18:26.037 --> 18:27.785
I don't do that to make you laugh.

18:28.004 --> 18:30.737
You don't? Well, then why do you do it?

18:32.818 --> 18:34.565
I hate it. I don't want to be a clown.

18:34.898 --> 18:36.643
- It's so weird.
- Are you serious?

18:37.083 --> 18:38.065
The jokes aren't funny

18:38.286 --> 18:41.567
and everybody's all, "honk,
honk, ooga, wah, wah."

18:41.783 --> 18:43.973
Lily, I love you so much. My gosh.

18:44.304 --> 18:45.941
W... w... why didn't you just tell him?

18:46.354 --> 18:47.991
I didn't want to hurt his feelings.

18:48.210 --> 18:49.521
So I figured if I was a bad clown,

18:49.741 --> 18:50.617
he'd want me to stop.

18:50.947 --> 18:52.414
Honey, you don't
have to worry about that.

18:52.482 --> 18:53.482
He'll understand.

18:53.550 --> 18:54.683
You don't have to do what daddy does.

18:54.751 --> 18:56.151
You just need to tell him the truth.

18:56.219 --> 18:58.620
- Tell me the truth about what?
- Nothing!

18:58.688 --> 19:00.088
No, Lily, it's it's okay.

19:01.791 --> 19:04.860
I'm sorry, daddy, but I think
I want to stop being a clown.

19:06.729 --> 19:09.598
But why? Y... you loved it.

19:09.666 --> 19:12.167
Because...

19:12.235 --> 19:14.803
because I'll never be as good as Fizbo.

19:14.871 --> 19:18.540
He's just so funny and special and magical.

19:18.608 --> 19:21.309
Sweetie... well, listen.

19:21.377 --> 19:25.514
<i>Fizbo is very special.</i>

19:25.581 --> 19:28.884
But you shouldn't expect to
be as good as he is right away.

19:28.951 --> 19:30.652
It's too much pressure.

19:30.720 --> 19:31.920
Aww!

19:31.988 --> 19:34.723
Maybe I'll try again when I'm older.

19:36.289 --> 19:38.145
Coming up with a lie
like that in the moment...

19:38.475 --> 19:39.456
that girl is no clown.

19:40.657 --> 19:41.314
She's gonna be a lawyer.

19:45.397 --> 19:47.062
Hey, neighbor.

19:47.281 --> 19:47.721
Hey.

19:47.937 --> 19:49.688
Just wanted to say I had a really good time

19:50.126 --> 19:50.783
hanging with your dad last night.

19:51.218 --> 19:51.984
You don't need to rub it in.

19:52.204 --> 19:54.063
I heard it all night... you
guys singing "Chantilly lace."

19:54.389 --> 19:55.595
No, I'm serious.

19:56.252 --> 19:57.124
We had a long talk.

19:57.456 --> 19:59.206
Your dad and his buddies,
they're good people.

20:00.304 --> 20:01.283
They played the whole army card.

20:02.158 --> 20:04.783
And, well, I'm gonna do the honorable thing

20:05.222 --> 20:05.985
and, move the boat.

20:07.624 --> 20:08.925
Really?

20:08.992 --> 20:11.060
Yeah, my brother says I
can keep it in his driveway.

20:11.128 --> 20:12.028
He hates his neighbor.

20:12.095 --> 20:13.696
I think your dad's right.

20:13.764 --> 20:15.665
We should start being
better to one another.

20:15.732 --> 20:17.600
I couldn't agree more. I think you'll see,

20:17.668 --> 20:18.834
once you get to know us,
we're good people, too...

20:23.607 --> 20:24.607
- There's no smoke.
- I know.

20:24.675 --> 20:26.475
Okay, folks.

20:26.543 --> 20:27.943
Who owns the boat?

20:28.011 --> 20:30.646
He... that would be
me. Why? Is there a problem?

20:30.714 --> 20:31.781
Technically, you can't store it here,

20:31.848 --> 20:33.449
and some crazy lady keeps calling.

20:33.517 --> 20:37.219
Hi, Officer. What's going on out here?

20:37.287 --> 20:39.021
Wait, you guys narc'd on us!

20:39.089 --> 20:41.290
No, I brought you banana bread! It was her!

20:41.358 --> 20:42.925
Now who's the narc?

20:42.993 --> 20:44.260
Claire, that's pretty uncool.

20:44.327 --> 20:46.262
Super uncool! You guys are lame!

20:46.329 --> 20:48.697
I'm also gonna have to write up these RVs.

20:50.100 --> 20:54.170
I'm holding. I'm making a walk for it.

21:01.896 --> 21:04.131
This again?

21:04.198 --> 21:05.966
Don't even think about coming over here.

21:09.170 --> 21:10.971
Hey.

21:11.039 --> 21:12.406
I'm serious.

21:16.444 --> 21:17.644
You did it!

21:17.712 --> 21:18.912
My God.

21:18.980 --> 21:20.847
That was the hardest thing
I've ever done in my life.

21:20.915 --> 21:22.983
Just do it a few more times,
and she'll be begging you

21:23.051 --> 21:25.652
to kiss her right in the science museum...

21:25.720 --> 21:29.055
Or... or what... whatever her fantasy is.
