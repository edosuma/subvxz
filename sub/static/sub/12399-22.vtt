00:41.986 --> 00:44.254
Saying your good-byes?

00:44.256 --> 00:46.223
More like good riddance.

00:46.225 --> 00:51.094
My trip to Washington
was very fruitful.

00:51.096 --> 00:54.380
The president came through.
We're getting our pardons.

00:54.382 --> 00:55.398
Should have them
by week's end.

00:55.400 --> 00:56.816
She kept to her word.

00:56.818 --> 00:59.569
That's because
she's afraid of us.

00:59.571 --> 01:02.405
She knows what we know,
what we could do to her.

01:02.407 --> 01:03.773
She's one of the only people
in the world

01:03.775 --> 01:04.775
who knows about Division.

01:04.775 --> 01:07.360
She should be afraid.

01:07.362 --> 01:11.948
Nikita, is there something
you want to say?

01:11.950 --> 01:14.751
Now's not the time
to do anything rash, Nikita,

01:14.753 --> 01:17.570
or I may have to do
something rash in return,

01:17.572 --> 01:20.123
like push the trigger
to activate the nanotoxin

01:20.125 --> 01:23.960
in Michael's blood.

01:23.962 --> 01:25.912
I just can't believe
the end is in sight.

01:25.914 --> 01:27.747
Yeah.

01:27.749 --> 01:30.066
There were plenty of times
I didn't think we'd make it.

01:30.068 --> 01:33.520
So you're okay
with letting go

01:33.522 --> 01:35.305
of pursuing Amanda?

01:35.307 --> 01:37.857
Michael convinced me
to move on.

01:37.859 --> 01:39.109
Yeah.

01:39.111 --> 01:42.595
Now, that is
what I call true love.

01:49.787 --> 01:51.321
What did you want
to show me?

01:51.323 --> 01:52.989
Remember when Nikki
went hunting for Amanda

01:52.991 --> 01:54.274
in that aqueduct?

01:54.276 --> 01:55.742
You mean
when your comms went out?

01:55.744 --> 01:56.876
Yeah, see, uh,

01:56.878 --> 01:58.712
my comms
don't just go out.

01:58.714 --> 02:00.163
Not like that.

02:00.165 --> 02:02.415
I ran some tests.

02:02.417 --> 02:04.084
There's nothing wrong
with the tech.

02:04.086 --> 02:05.502
Well, maybe Shadownet's
not up to snuff yet.

02:05.504 --> 02:06.953
Shadownet's got plenty
of snuff.

02:06.955 --> 02:08.922
It's got snuff coming out
of its ears.

02:08.924 --> 02:13.643
No, I did some digging--

02:13.645 --> 02:17.097
there was a jamming field
dropped over the entire area.

02:17.099 --> 02:18.315
Jamming field?

02:18.317 --> 02:19.733
Last time we saw one of those,
it was--

02:19.735 --> 02:22.185
Amanda.

02:22.187 --> 02:25.021
She used it in Colombia
when you guys went after Ramon.

02:25.023 --> 02:26.573
I checked.

02:26.575 --> 02:29.025
It's the same
power signature.

02:29.027 --> 02:31.111
Why would Amanda
jam that aqueduct?

02:31.113 --> 02:33.246
She didn't want us
to hear something,

02:33.248 --> 02:36.166
or someone.

02:36.168 --> 02:37.834
Nikita said there was no one
down there, just her.

02:37.836 --> 02:39.119
Yeah, see,
that's the other thing.

02:39.121 --> 02:42.922
Nikki was out of contact
for 22 minutes.

02:42.924 --> 02:44.507
That's a long time
to be wandering

02:44.509 --> 02:48.211
around a supposedly
empty aqueduct.

02:48.213 --> 02:49.763
You saying she lied?

02:49.765 --> 02:51.131
If the power signature fits--

02:51.133 --> 02:52.849
look, Mikey,
we still don't know

02:52.851 --> 02:55.969
what Amanda did to her
in that chair.

02:55.971 --> 02:57.003
We've seen this before,

02:57.005 --> 02:59.172
the lies,
the cover ups.

02:59.174 --> 03:03.893
It's Alex
all over again.

03:03.895 --> 03:05.695
Where is she?

03:05.697 --> 03:06.830
I need more time.

03:06.832 --> 03:08.565
My conditions
were clear.

03:08.567 --> 03:10.500
I gave you 24 hours
to kill the president.

03:10.502 --> 03:12.018
I need--
I need tactical plans.

03:12.020 --> 03:13.486
I need mission support.
I need a team.

03:13.488 --> 03:15.572
No.
No help from anyone.

03:15.574 --> 03:17.574
You tell anyone,
and Michael is dead

03:17.576 --> 03:19.192
before you finish
the sentence.

03:19.194 --> 03:21.077
Listen to me,
you bitch--

03:21.079 --> 03:23.913
- This is not a negotiation.
- I--

03:23.915 --> 03:25.582
They say
every good plan allows

03:25.584 --> 03:28.001
for some unpredictability,

03:28.003 --> 03:29.052
but I confess,

03:29.054 --> 03:30.503
I fail
to see the need

03:30.505 --> 03:32.172
to enlist
as volatile an element

03:32.174 --> 03:35.675
as Nikita.

03:36.844 --> 03:39.262
The group
wants the president dead.

03:39.264 --> 03:40.764
I want Nikita
branded a killer

03:40.766 --> 03:42.098
for the whole world
to see.

03:42.100 --> 03:45.185
Our interests
dovetail perfectly.

03:45.187 --> 03:47.070
Trust me,

03:47.072 --> 03:50.723
this is how we all get
what we want.

03:54.228 --> 03:56.162
Ryan, you really need
to see this.

03:56.164 --> 03:58.081
This is Dr. Tolcher.

03:58.083 --> 04:00.066
The scientist
who developed the poison?

04:00.068 --> 04:02.702
Not just a poison.
A nanotoxin.

04:02.704 --> 04:05.622
Microscopic particles
that lie dormant in your blood

04:05.624 --> 04:08.958
until someone triggers them
to release a toxin.

04:08.960 --> 04:12.245
Scientifically,
it's an incredible achievement.

04:12.247 --> 04:13.713
What's your interest?

04:13.715 --> 04:16.599
This guy was experimenting
on human subjects.

04:16.601 --> 04:18.284
Where did they
come from?

04:18.286 --> 04:21.421
Vagrants, orphans,
untraceables--

04:21.423 --> 04:23.022
In other words,
human trafficking.

04:23.024 --> 04:26.476
How does a guy like this
get hooked into that world?

04:26.478 --> 04:27.927
How does he
get mixed up

04:27.929 --> 04:29.946
with some shadowy
global organization

04:29.948 --> 04:32.232
that trades
in innocent lives?

04:34.886 --> 04:36.319
This is medical.

04:36.321 --> 04:39.072
Yeah, Sonya,
is Nikita down there with you?

04:39.074 --> 04:40.957
- No.
- Has anyone seen her?

04:40.959 --> 04:42.258
Uh, she was in Ops.

04:42.260 --> 04:43.293
Well, she's not here
anymore.

04:43.295 --> 04:45.128
Why?
What's wrong?

04:45.130 --> 04:48.998
We think Nikki's been
acting weird.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.333
Like Amanda weird.

04:51.336 --> 04:52.919
Hang on.

04:52.921 --> 04:55.755
Someone just started
the car lift.

04:55.757 --> 04:58.925
She's headed up top.

05:15.326 --> 05:17.277
Where are you going?

05:19.864 --> 05:21.080
To take care
of a few things.

05:21.082 --> 05:22.198
I'm in a rush.

05:22.200 --> 05:25.835
Is that
what it feels like?

05:25.837 --> 05:27.320
Like what you have to do
is so important

05:27.322 --> 05:29.589
that it just can't wait?

05:29.591 --> 05:31.007
- Michael--
- It's not real.

05:31.009 --> 05:32.292
Amanda has gotten
into your head,

05:32.294 --> 05:34.961
just like she did
with Alex.

05:34.963 --> 05:37.347
That's not it.

05:37.349 --> 05:40.833
Nikita--

05:40.835 --> 05:43.553
Nikita,
put the gun down.

05:43.555 --> 05:44.721
Think about
what you're doing.

05:44.723 --> 05:46.105
This is--

05:46.107 --> 05:48.441
this is Amanda.
We've seen this before.

05:48.443 --> 05:49.809
Yes, we have.

05:52.697 --> 05:55.398
I'm sorry, Michael.
I can't help it.

05:55.400 --> 05:59.702
She's in my head.
I can't shut her out.

05:59.704 --> 06:01.187
I don't want to hurt you,
but I will.

06:01.189 --> 06:02.288
Nikita,
you can fight this.

06:02.290 --> 06:03.523
Let me help you.

06:03.525 --> 06:05.658
There's so much
I want to say.

06:05.660 --> 06:06.793
Not now.

06:06.795 --> 06:08.161
Not until we can
be alone together.

06:08.163 --> 06:10.380
I wish I knew
when that will be.

06:27.680 --> 06:31.680

06:39.937 --> 06:41.804
Sorry, Michael.

06:41.806 --> 06:43.122
I can't help it.
She's in my head.

06:43.124 --> 06:44.690
I can't shut her out.

06:44.692 --> 06:46.258
I don't want to hurt you,
but I will.

06:46.260 --> 06:48.060
Nikita,
you can fight this.

06:48.062 --> 06:49.278
Let me help you.

06:49.280 --> 06:51.063
Something's not right.

06:51.065 --> 06:53.065
What Amanda does
isn't possession.

06:53.067 --> 06:54.233
When I did the things
that I did,

06:54.235 --> 06:55.284
my actions felt natural,

06:55.286 --> 06:56.936
the result
of my own choices.

06:56.938 --> 06:58.738
I wasn't aware
that I was being manipulated.

06:58.740 --> 06:59.940
So you're saying
this isn't one

06:59.941 --> 07:01.106
of Amanda's Jedi mind tricks?

07:01.108 --> 07:02.792
I don't think so.

07:02.794 --> 07:04.477
Nikita's doing this
on her own?

07:04.479 --> 07:07.497
Doing what?
And why the act?

07:07.499 --> 07:09.499
To send us a message.

07:22.012 --> 07:23.896
Susan?

07:23.898 --> 07:25.398
Janet Malcolm.

07:25.400 --> 07:26.682
President Spencer's
personal aide.

07:26.684 --> 07:28.801
We met in Toronto
during the G20.

07:28.803 --> 07:31.254
I arranged for you
to get into the gala.

07:31.256 --> 07:32.738
Yes, of course.
How are you?

07:32.740 --> 07:34.273
- Good.
- It's good to see you.

07:34.275 --> 07:35.758
You too.
Well, what are you doing here?

07:35.760 --> 07:36.859
I'm teaching a seminar
at Georgetown.

07:36.861 --> 07:38.444
Oh.

07:38.446 --> 07:41.414
The press department
was looking for you in Toronto.

07:41.416 --> 07:43.916
Yeah, they wanted
to do a little media package

07:43.918 --> 07:46.369
on your close relationship
with the president,

07:46.371 --> 07:49.172
get you talking
about her impact on your life.

07:49.174 --> 07:52.208
She has had an impact.

07:52.210 --> 07:55.461
Janet,
I'm glad I ran into you.

07:55.463 --> 07:58.931
I need
to ask you something.

07:58.933 --> 08:02.668
I need to get on the President's
calendar today.

08:02.670 --> 08:04.336
- Today?
- I know it's short notice,

08:04.338 --> 08:06.005
but I have something
very important

08:06.007 --> 08:08.007
I need to speak with her about.
Well, I'm sorry,

08:08.009 --> 08:10.309
but no one gets on the
President's calendar that fast.

08:10.311 --> 08:13.012
I mean, not unless
World War III is breaking out.

08:13.014 --> 08:16.399
And plus, the Secret Service
would still have to pre-screen--

08:17.651 --> 08:19.368
I'm sorry.
I really am.

08:19.370 --> 08:22.705
But I'm not asking.

08:22.707 --> 08:25.041
She said there were things
she wanted to say,

08:25.043 --> 08:26.709
but we had to...

08:26.711 --> 08:31.297
"Wait until we can
be alone together."

08:32.216 --> 08:35.001
"Wait until we can
be alone."

08:35.003 --> 08:36.702
Maybe she knew we were
watching her on security cams?

08:36.703 --> 08:38.837
Or maybe
Amanda was listening.

08:38.840 --> 08:40.172
When Amanda forced me
to be her mole,

08:40.174 --> 08:41.557
I couldn't
tell any of you,

08:41.558 --> 08:44.227
because I knew
that she was monitoring me.

08:44.229 --> 08:46.879
That's why Nikki
was acting so squirrelly.

08:46.881 --> 08:49.515
Nikita was trying
to tell us she's been bugged.

08:49.517 --> 08:50.900
Tolcher's
subcutaneous comm.

08:50.902 --> 08:53.152
Amanda could have
implanted one in Nikita.

08:53.154 --> 08:55.071
Birkhoff, can you reverse
engineer the chip in Tolcher?

08:55.073 --> 08:56.606
Isolate the frequency
Amanda's using?

08:56.608 --> 08:57.940
We might be able
to use that to--

08:57.942 --> 08:59.558
To track the comm
that's in Nikki.

08:59.560 --> 09:00.943
Yeah, I think so.

09:00.945 --> 09:03.496
You want to go
play operation?

09:12.256 --> 09:13.506
Call in,

09:13.508 --> 09:15.174
tell them
you'll be out sick,

09:15.176 --> 09:18.243
and get me
on the President's schedule.

09:18.245 --> 09:19.679
I don't have the authority
to do that.

09:19.681 --> 09:21.764
Janet, I found you.

09:21.766 --> 09:24.750
I can easily track
where your home is,

09:24.752 --> 09:26.769
your family.

09:38.932 --> 09:41.484
Tracy.
Could you do me a favor?

09:41.486 --> 09:44.153
I forgot to put someone
on the schedule.

09:44.155 --> 09:47.907
Uh, a Susan Mason.

09:49.626 --> 09:51.610
Okay, I got a lock
on the frequency.

09:51.612 --> 09:53.129
It's coming from D.C.

09:53.131 --> 09:54.246
She's in Washington?

09:54.248 --> 09:56.549
I just checked
the armory.

09:56.551 --> 09:58.217
In addition to her Glock,
she took a silencer,

09:58.219 --> 10:00.553
a PSG-1 sniper rifle
and scope,

10:00.555 --> 10:01.771
plus match grade ammo.

10:01.773 --> 10:05.808
That's a kill mission kit.

10:05.810 --> 10:09.628
She told me Spencer
should be afraid of her.

10:09.630 --> 10:10.980
She was trying
to warn me.

10:10.982 --> 10:13.465
Warn you of what?

10:13.467 --> 10:16.352
She's going to try
and kill the President.

10:18.855 --> 10:21.640
Look, I'm not going
to hurt you, all right?

10:21.642 --> 10:23.308
A construction crew will be here
in a few hours.

10:23.310 --> 10:25.978
They'll find you.
You'll be fine.

10:25.980 --> 10:28.414
You try to get by Secret
Service without clearance,

10:28.416 --> 10:30.416
and they will
shoot you.

10:30.418 --> 10:32.702
If I fail,
there'll be no reason to live.

10:37.507 --> 10:40.376
Amanda, the president is
inside the White House all day.

10:40.378 --> 10:42.345
No chance to sniper
from long range.

10:42.347 --> 10:43.996
But I did get an appointment
to see her.

10:43.998 --> 10:46.132
I knew
you'd find a way.

10:46.134 --> 10:47.666
I still have to get
past White House security.

10:47.668 --> 10:49.668
I told you
I needed a team for this.

10:49.670 --> 10:51.670
Not that you would know anything
about needing friends.

10:51.672 --> 10:53.556
Oh, I know all about
how valuable

10:53.558 --> 10:55.641
having the right friends
can be.

10:57.477 --> 10:59.895
Get me Stirling.

11:10.040 --> 11:11.974
Nikki,
I'm talking to you

11:11.976 --> 11:14.193
through your car's
onboard navigation system.

11:14.195 --> 11:15.694
- Birkhoff?
- No time to explain.

11:15.696 --> 11:17.580
We have
a very short window.

11:17.582 --> 11:19.165
Win
window for what?

11:25.589 --> 11:28.207
Alex.

11:28.209 --> 11:30.042
You have
to get out of here now.

11:30.044 --> 11:32.561
Nikita--

11:32.563 --> 11:33.979
Let me go.

11:33.981 --> 11:35.231
You don't know
what you're doing.

11:35.233 --> 11:36.381
We know
about Amanda's bug.

11:36.383 --> 11:37.650
Birkhoff's jamming it.

11:37.652 --> 11:38.984
No.

11:38.986 --> 11:40.385
You can't.
She'll know.

11:40.387 --> 11:42.387
No, it's disguised
as interference.

11:42.389 --> 11:44.023
She'll think you went
through a tunnel or something.

11:44.025 --> 11:45.825
As long as we don't
cut her out for too long.

11:45.827 --> 11:48.244
Just long enough to stop you
from killing the President.

11:52.282 --> 11:55.117
We know.
We got your message.

12:03.226 --> 12:06.929
I've lost
Nikita's signal.

12:06.931 --> 12:09.131
If you can't clear it up
in a few seconds,

12:09.133 --> 12:11.600
let me know.

12:13.437 --> 12:14.470
We know Amanda didn't
alter your brain,

12:14.472 --> 12:15.754
so what did she do
to you?

12:15.756 --> 12:17.473
She didn't do anything
to me.

12:17.475 --> 12:19.391
She did something
to you.

12:27.484 --> 12:29.118
The nanotoxin is embedded

12:29.120 --> 12:34.707
in the carbon fiber bone
of your new hand.

12:34.709 --> 12:36.459
If I don't
fulfill her mission,

12:36.461 --> 12:38.377
she won't
give me the antidote.

12:42.716 --> 12:47.336
I kill the President,
or you die, Michael.

12:47.338 --> 12:48.504
I have to go.
Amanda's going--

12:48.506 --> 12:49.805
There's no way

12:49.807 --> 12:51.307
I'm letting you
go through with this.

12:51.309 --> 12:52.624
What happens to you if you do?
I'd rather--

12:52.626 --> 12:53.843
You'd rather die?

12:53.845 --> 12:57.296
That's why I didn't tell you.

12:57.298 --> 12:59.982
- You can't just--
- What choice do I have?

12:59.984 --> 13:02.151
Why did you
give us clues

13:02.153 --> 13:04.854
if you didn't want us
to stop you?

13:04.856 --> 13:07.239
Because if I have
to go through with this,

13:07.241 --> 13:10.493
I wanted you
to know why.

13:10.495 --> 13:12.945
What if there's
another way?

13:12.947 --> 13:14.697
We take the nanotoxin
out of play.

13:14.699 --> 13:16.916
We know
there's an antidote.

13:16.918 --> 13:19.251
No, we already used
the last dose on Maryam Hasan.

13:19.253 --> 13:20.703
Okay,
so we find more.

13:20.705 --> 13:22.654
In the research,
we found another scientist.

13:22.656 --> 13:23.956
His name is Kang.

13:23.958 --> 13:25.490
If anything,
it looks like

13:25.492 --> 13:27.092
Tolcher was working heavily
from his theories.

13:27.094 --> 13:31.764
He may be able
to make more antidote.

13:31.766 --> 13:33.665
I can't go.
Amanda's watching.

13:33.667 --> 13:35.050
We can.

13:35.052 --> 13:37.019
Stick to your plan
so she doesn't suspect.

13:37.021 --> 13:38.554
We'll go
find the antidote.

13:38.556 --> 13:40.856
I can buy you
some time.

13:40.858 --> 13:42.024
Nikita--

13:42.026 --> 13:44.676
Michael,
if you want to save me,

13:44.678 --> 13:46.862
save yourself.

13:56.715 --> 13:58.254
How do we know
Dr. Kang isn't working

13:58.255 --> 13:59.954
for the Shop too?
We don't.

14:00.480 --> 14:02.096
Part of me hopes
he's dirty.

14:02.098 --> 14:05.200
At least
I could punch someone.

14:05.202 --> 14:07.318
Alex, look.

14:07.320 --> 14:08.987
If this goes bad,

14:08.989 --> 14:11.039
I'm worried about
what it'll do to Nikita.

14:11.041 --> 14:12.790
Make her understand
that her family,

14:12.792 --> 14:13.958
the one
that she's built,

14:13.960 --> 14:15.443
is there for her.

14:15.445 --> 14:17.996
She started this journey
by herself.

14:17.998 --> 14:20.582
I need to know
she will not end it alone.

14:20.584 --> 14:23.835
She won't.

14:23.837 --> 14:25.587
I promise.

14:25.589 --> 14:28.006
Excuse me.
You can't be here.

14:28.008 --> 14:29.290
Dr. Kang, CIA.

14:29.292 --> 14:31.959
We need a moment
of your time.

14:56.535 --> 14:58.503
I'm here on Commander
Evan Danforth's orders.

14:58.505 --> 15:01.372
You have anything
about this?

15:03.158 --> 15:04.208
This is Blue 1.

15:04.210 --> 15:05.710
We have an unsub
in the tunnels

15:05.712 --> 15:09.013
and are investigating.

15:09.015 --> 15:10.265
Lock it down.

15:12.385 --> 15:15.119
This is...

15:15.121 --> 15:16.504
This is outrageous.

15:16.506 --> 15:17.989
So you recognize
what Tolcher was doing?

15:17.991 --> 15:20.358
He took my nanoparticle
drug delivery system

15:20.360 --> 15:22.393
and weaponized it.

15:22.395 --> 15:23.728
How did he get this?

15:23.730 --> 15:25.280
The people
he's working with

15:25.282 --> 15:27.482
have eyes everywhere.

15:27.484 --> 15:29.200
So someone's spying
on my lab?

15:29.202 --> 15:30.518
Possibly.

15:30.520 --> 15:31.653
More importantly,
is there a way

15:31.655 --> 15:33.187
to counter the nanotoxin?

15:33.189 --> 15:35.490
I don't know.
Maybe.

15:35.492 --> 15:38.042
Nanocells are designed
to mimic human tissue,

15:38.044 --> 15:39.627
so they can't survive
without a live host

15:39.629 --> 15:41.079
for more than 20 minutes.

15:41.081 --> 15:42.330
Doctor, yes or no?

15:42.332 --> 15:43.881
Yes.
Yes, if I had

15:43.883 --> 15:46.467
a live, infected subject
to work with.

15:49.838 --> 15:51.673
Well,
you've got one.

15:57.146 --> 15:59.263
These tunnels
are classified.

15:59.265 --> 16:00.898
How did you get access?

16:00.900 --> 16:04.152
I'm a covert operative
for Commander Evan Danforth.

16:04.154 --> 16:05.886
He told me to use them.

16:05.888 --> 16:07.405
Commander Danforth
is dead.

16:07.407 --> 16:08.489
I know.

16:08.491 --> 16:09.641
But my mission
is still active.

16:09.643 --> 16:11.159
I couldn't risk
being seen

16:11.161 --> 16:12.893
going through
a public route.

16:12.895 --> 16:16.664
I have very important intel
for the President.

16:16.666 --> 16:18.249
Regarding what?

16:18.251 --> 16:21.569
For her ears only.

16:24.206 --> 16:26.624
We'll check out
your story.

16:29.461 --> 16:30.762
I'm going
to need supplies.

16:30.764 --> 16:32.046
We have a lab
ready to go.

16:32.048 --> 16:33.648
Why can't I just
work here?

16:33.650 --> 16:36.300
Security could
be an issue.

16:53.068 --> 16:54.285
Well done.

16:54.287 --> 16:56.204
So Dr. Tolcher
had you infect Kang

16:56.206 --> 16:57.321
with the nanotoxin?

16:57.323 --> 16:58.623
Yes, sir.

16:58.625 --> 16:59.957
A failsafe
in case Kang ever discovered

16:59.959 --> 17:02.727
that we had been
hacking his research.

17:02.729 --> 17:04.944
Excellent foresight.

17:04.946 --> 17:08.165
Let's, um--let's keep this
between us, shall we?

17:08.167 --> 17:09.834
Amanda might feel compelled
to do something rash

17:09.836 --> 17:11.285
in response
to this action,

17:11.287 --> 17:12.587
which wouldn't be prudent
for anybody.

17:12.589 --> 17:13.887
Of course.

17:18.176 --> 17:20.678
- Come with us.
- Where are we going?

17:25.901 --> 17:27.468
Uncuff her.

17:30.606 --> 17:31.806
Return to your posts.

17:31.808 --> 17:32.857
Sir, we really
should stay with--

17:32.859 --> 17:34.726
I said, dismissed.

17:51.510 --> 17:52.593
I've cleared agents
from the blue sector

17:52.595 --> 17:53.945
for the next ten minutes.

17:53.947 --> 17:56.848
I can get you as far
as the Oval Office.

17:56.850 --> 17:59.784
You'll need this.

17:59.786 --> 18:01.886
How much
did Amanda pay you

18:01.888 --> 18:04.472
to betray your country?
I don't work for Amanda.

18:04.474 --> 18:05.873
But the people
I do work for

18:05.875 --> 18:07.191
want to make sure
she gets what she needs,

18:07.193 --> 18:08.409
and this has nothing
to do with money.

18:08.411 --> 18:10.177
Then why are you
doing this?

18:13.732 --> 18:17.568
Be a good girl
and take the gun.

18:22.541 --> 18:24.375
I told you, Nikita,

18:24.377 --> 18:26.327
I know all about
how valuable it is

18:26.329 --> 18:28.079
to have the right friends.

18:28.081 --> 18:30.030
Then why not have him
do the job?

18:30.032 --> 18:31.499
Do you really need
to ask?

18:31.501 --> 18:33.217
You're the one
who has to suffer,

18:33.219 --> 18:35.803
so you're the one who has
to take the fall for this.

18:35.805 --> 18:38.205
Now, no more excuses
or unforeseen problems,

18:38.207 --> 18:40.541
because I've thought
of everything.

18:45.230 --> 18:48.432
Birkhoff, do you have a read
on Nikita's position?

18:48.434 --> 18:50.768
Just give me a sec.

18:50.770 --> 18:52.320
If I'm not careful,
Amanda's going to figure out

18:52.322 --> 18:54.322
she's on a party line.

18:54.324 --> 18:55.740
You find the Doc?

18:55.742 --> 18:58.359
He's dead.
Where is she?

19:02.998 --> 19:04.832
- Just outside the oval.
- Can you patch me in to Nikita

19:04.834 --> 19:06.083
over Amanda's comm

19:06.085 --> 19:07.368
without Amanda hearing?
Are you nuts?

19:07.370 --> 19:09.253
If Nikita's signal
drops out now,

19:09.255 --> 19:11.071
Amanda's definitely
going to know something's up.

19:11.073 --> 19:13.090
I just need a few seconds.
Can you do it?

19:13.092 --> 19:15.676
- Technically, yes--
- Then do it.

19:27.422 --> 19:29.607
Single shot to the head.

19:29.609 --> 19:31.592
Make it count.

19:39.818 --> 19:42.486
Ms. Mason,
you can go in now.

19:42.488 --> 19:44.822
Thank you.

19:51.630 --> 19:52.997
What are you doing here,

19:52.999 --> 19:55.399
and how the hell
did you get on my schedule?

19:59.755 --> 20:01.255
There's something
I have to do.

20:01.257 --> 20:02.840
I've settled everything
with Fletcher.

20:02.842 --> 20:05.009
You have no more obligation
to me or the government.

20:05.011 --> 20:08.846
This is
about saving someone.

20:08.848 --> 20:10.130
Have you ever had
to decide

20:10.132 --> 20:13.234
between two
impossible choices?

20:13.236 --> 20:16.470
Of course.

20:16.472 --> 20:19.023
But if you step back,
you'll usually see

20:19.025 --> 20:21.576
that one is more important
than the other.

20:21.578 --> 20:25.363
Nikita,
can you hear me?

20:25.365 --> 20:27.365
- Michael?
- What?

20:27.367 --> 20:30.117
It's okay.
Amanda can't hear us.

20:30.119 --> 20:32.536
Do you have
the antidote?

20:32.538 --> 20:34.422
Have you
lost your mind?

20:34.424 --> 20:36.457
Okay, look, I-I don't
have a lot of time, so--

20:36.459 --> 20:40.928
Michael, do you
have the antidote?

20:40.930 --> 20:42.680
Tell her.

20:42.682 --> 20:46.183
We don't have it.

20:46.185 --> 20:49.670
Yes.
We have it.

20:49.672 --> 20:51.772
The threat's
been neutralized.

20:51.774 --> 20:54.008
You can abort.

20:54.010 --> 20:57.612
Oh, thank God.

20:57.614 --> 20:59.614
I love you.

21:00.816 --> 21:03.451
I love you, too.

21:07.823 --> 21:10.007
There's something
you need to know.

21:10.009 --> 21:11.525
There are people
trying to kill you.

21:11.527 --> 21:13.494
A lot of people
are trying to kill me.

21:13.496 --> 21:15.413
I'm the President
of the United States.

21:15.415 --> 21:19.216
I'm talking
about your inner circle.

21:19.218 --> 21:22.369
One of your Secret Service
gave me this to kill you,

21:22.371 --> 21:26.140
to take you out.

21:26.142 --> 21:27.508
That's from my security?

21:27.510 --> 21:28.726
Yes, it is.

21:28.728 --> 21:30.811
I know who,
but there could be more.

21:37.069 --> 21:40.521
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

21:40.523 --> 21:41.906
Do you know
what you have to do?

21:41.908 --> 21:45.860
I know exactly
what I have to do.

21:58.090 --> 21:59.290
Got a gun.

21:59.292 --> 22:00.374
Secure the exits.
Secure them now.

22:00.376 --> 22:01.625
We need a medic.

22:01.627 --> 22:02.677
Down.
I said, down.

22:02.679 --> 22:03.761
Get trauma down here now.

22:03.763 --> 22:06.180
Eagle is down.
Eagle is down.

22:06.182 --> 22:07.748
Eagle is down.

22:07.750 --> 22:10.250
I told you...

22:10.252 --> 22:12.019
I've thought
of everything.

22:19.389 --> 22:20.688
- Eagle is down.
- Lock down castle.

22:20.689 --> 22:22.014
Alert the M.U.
Eagle is down.

22:22.015 --> 22:23.264
We need a trauma unit.

22:23.266 --> 22:24.565
Get the Vice President
to the bunker.

22:24.567 --> 22:25.650
Initiate priority
security protocol.

22:25.652 --> 22:27.051
Get her secure
off site.

22:27.053 --> 22:29.604
Use the tunnels.
No eyes. Go. Go.

22:30.006 --> 22:32.890
Please tell me
that didn't just happen.

22:32.892 --> 22:35.292
It happened.
It--it really happened.

22:35.294 --> 22:38.295
The President is dead.

22:39.481 --> 22:41.766
And somehow,
Amanda was responsible for it.

22:41.768 --> 22:42.817
This was all a trap
to frame Nikita.

22:42.819 --> 22:44.351
It was a contingency.

22:44.353 --> 22:46.053
Amanda made sure
Nikita would go down

22:46.055 --> 22:47.488
for the assassination

22:47.490 --> 22:49.039
even if Nikita couldn't
pull the trigger.

22:49.041 --> 22:50.641
The game was rigged
all along.

22:50.643 --> 22:52.777
But how?

22:52.779 --> 22:55.012
Could she have gotten
in Spencer's head?

22:55.014 --> 22:56.947
Somehow gotten her
in her chair?

22:56.949 --> 22:58.416
Oh, how would she gain
that kind of access?

22:58.418 --> 23:00.201
And if she did,
why not kill the President then?

23:00.203 --> 23:01.685
Guys, this is the Shop
we're talking about.

23:01.687 --> 23:02.986
It's got to be
some kind of--

23:02.988 --> 23:04.288
Hey, hey.
None of this matters.

23:04.290 --> 23:06.040
What matters is
we have to save Nikita.

23:06.042 --> 23:07.875
The Secret Service is going
to be all over her by now.

23:07.877 --> 23:09.159
That's if they haven't
already dropped her

23:09.161 --> 23:12.012
in the deepest hole
they got.

23:14.766 --> 23:16.383
Hey.
Where are you going?

23:16.385 --> 23:17.852
Getting her out.

23:17.854 --> 23:19.937
- Michael, you're at risk--
- Screw that.

23:19.939 --> 23:21.856
Look, Michael,
we will rescue Nikita,

23:21.858 --> 23:24.058
but you can't do anything
if you're dead.

23:24.060 --> 23:26.060
I'm dead already.
Kang is gone,

23:26.062 --> 23:29.363
as is any chance
of me getting an antidote.

23:29.365 --> 23:31.031
And I'll be damned
if I stand around

23:31.033 --> 23:32.533
while Nikita's
in trouble.

23:32.535 --> 23:34.518
Wait,
you're not dead yet.

23:34.520 --> 23:35.986
Look, I've been thinking,
Kang said

23:35.988 --> 23:38.856
that the nanocells react
just like living tissue.

23:38.858 --> 23:41.024
They die
when the host body dies.

23:43.678 --> 23:46.213
So?

23:46.215 --> 23:51.252
So what
if the host body dies?

23:51.254 --> 23:52.970
I get it.

23:52.972 --> 23:55.706
We kill Mikey,
we kill the nanocells.

23:55.708 --> 23:59.093
Then we revive him.

23:59.095 --> 24:03.631
It's what Amanda did to me
to deactivate my kill chip.

24:03.633 --> 24:06.433
We don't have
that time.

24:06.435 --> 24:09.270
You remember
what Nikita said?

24:09.272 --> 24:12.423
To save her,
you have to save yourself.

24:17.279 --> 24:18.612
What's that?

24:18.614 --> 24:20.030
It's to lower
your body temperature.

24:20.032 --> 24:21.332
We have to stop your heart
for 20 minutes.

24:21.334 --> 24:22.366
That's how long
Kang said it takes

24:22.368 --> 24:24.001
to kill the nanocells.

24:24.003 --> 24:25.503
The only way
to prevent brain damage

24:25.505 --> 24:27.237
is to induce hypothermia.

24:27.239 --> 24:29.423
Preventing brain damage
would be good.

24:34.262 --> 24:35.596
You're trying
to figure out

24:35.598 --> 24:37.965
why I did it this way,
aren't you?

24:37.967 --> 24:40.801
See, my associates
needed the President dead,

24:40.803 --> 24:44.087
but they also needed
a specific narrative.

24:44.089 --> 24:47.858
So I gave them an assassin
with an axe to grind.

24:47.860 --> 24:51.529
From now
until the end of history,

24:51.531 --> 24:55.065
every man, woman, and child
will know your name.

24:55.067 --> 25:00.404
Booth, Oswald...Nikita.

25:01.239 --> 25:02.823
You know, it's funny,

25:02.825 --> 25:05.626
I'm the only one
who hasn't gone through this.

25:05.628 --> 25:08.162
All of you have already
done this resurrection thing.

25:08.164 --> 25:11.582
Well, it's about time
you joined the club.

25:11.584 --> 25:13.551
Your story's not going
to hold up.

25:13.553 --> 25:15.152
You're right.

25:15.154 --> 25:18.022
Your testimony
could confuse matters,

25:18.024 --> 25:20.090
which is why I can't
allow you to speak

25:20.092 --> 25:22.343
to anyone, ever.

25:22.345 --> 25:24.061
Stand down.

25:24.063 --> 25:25.128
There's been a change
in orders.

25:25.130 --> 25:26.797
Sir?

25:26.799 --> 25:28.232
Return to castle.
The suspect's coming with me.

25:28.234 --> 25:29.516
No, stop.
Don't listen to him.

25:29.518 --> 25:31.435
Sir, the protocol
is very clear.

25:31.437 --> 25:32.770
We're changing
the protocol.

25:32.772 --> 25:34.638
Now turn her over.
That's an order.

25:34.640 --> 25:36.307
He's working with the people
who killed the President.

25:36.309 --> 25:37.575
Agent, you've lost control
of your prisoner.

25:37.577 --> 25:38.642
Will you shut her--

25:40.696 --> 25:42.580
Up?

25:42.582 --> 25:43.747
This is Stirling.

25:43.749 --> 25:45.366
I have control
of the situation.

25:45.368 --> 25:47.001
All agents stand down.
All agents down.

25:47.003 --> 25:48.452
Wait a minute.
He's on Amanda's frequency.

25:48.454 --> 25:50.537
I might be able
to overload the relay.

25:50.539 --> 25:51.622
Make it look
like she got loose

25:51.624 --> 25:53.007
and killed the others,

25:53.009 --> 25:54.658
but not before
they fatally shot her first.

26:13.895 --> 26:17.014
Thanks, Birkhoff.

26:19.734 --> 26:22.453
Listen, whatever you guys
are going to do, do it fast,

26:22.455 --> 26:25.122
because Amanda is definitely
going to be on to us now.

26:29.327 --> 26:31.194
Welcome to Division.

26:37.219 --> 26:38.802
Start the clock.

26:45.810 --> 26:48.028
Stirling, report in.

26:49.781 --> 26:51.815
Stirling.

26:53.018 --> 26:54.985
Birkhoff.

26:56.387 --> 27:00.274
Send the kill signal,
and trigger the nanotoxin now.

27:00.276 --> 27:01.558
Birkhoff, how is he?

27:01.560 --> 27:03.577
Uh, he's--he's dead,

27:03.579 --> 27:05.245
but, uh,
not the way you think.

27:05.247 --> 27:07.064
We had to flatline him
to kill the nanotoxin.

27:07.066 --> 27:08.916
What?
What about the antidote?

27:08.918 --> 27:11.168
They, uh,
they never got it.

27:11.170 --> 27:13.070
It's okay, though.
Alex is on top of it.

27:13.072 --> 27:14.455
20 minutes, and they're going
to bring him back.

27:14.457 --> 27:16.507
I'm on my way.
Birkhoff, listen to me.

27:16.509 --> 27:17.958
Don't let him die.
Do you understand?

27:17.960 --> 27:20.678
Don't you dare
let him die.

27:24.265 --> 27:28.018
We sent out a signal
but never got a valid response.

27:28.020 --> 27:29.953
The nanotoxin
was never activated.

27:35.727 --> 27:37.111
There's a group
of gentlemen

27:37.113 --> 27:39.763
I hired for quite a bit
of money recently.

27:39.765 --> 27:42.783
Former employees, actually.
They're on standby.

27:42.785 --> 27:45.169
I'd like you to tell them
it's time to go to work.

27:45.171 --> 27:46.453
What orders
shall I give them?

27:46.455 --> 27:48.772
Tell them to return
to Division

27:48.774 --> 27:52.526
and wipe everyone out.

27:58.821 --> 28:01.906
One, two, three,
four, five.

28:01.908 --> 28:04.125
150.

28:04.877 --> 28:06.127
Clear.

28:09.748 --> 28:12.550
Adrenaline.

28:12.552 --> 28:16.504
200.

28:16.506 --> 28:18.473
Clear.

28:20.042 --> 28:23.428
There.

28:23.430 --> 28:24.762
Damn it!

28:24.764 --> 28:27.014
One, two, three--

28:38.811 --> 28:42.080
Guys, we have
multiple hostiles incoming.

28:42.082 --> 28:43.564
They are well-armed.

28:43.566 --> 28:44.866
Judging
from their cover formation,

28:44.868 --> 28:46.734
they're well-trained.
Damn it.

28:46.736 --> 28:48.870
Come on, Michael.
Michael, come on!

28:55.177 --> 28:56.761
Son of a--

28:56.763 --> 28:58.629
Nikki, I've gotta go.
We're under attack.

28:58.631 --> 29:00.264
It's the rest
of the Dirty 30s.

29:00.266 --> 29:01.549
If you've got any power-ups
left for that car,

29:01.551 --> 29:03.217
now's the time
to use them.

29:03.219 --> 29:05.136
Everybody, we've got bad guys
on the way down.

29:05.138 --> 29:06.687
You guys go.

29:06.689 --> 29:08.306
I'll stay with Michael.

29:08.308 --> 29:12.810
One, two, three--

29:16.982 --> 29:19.066
- Who are they?
- I caught a couple faces.

29:19.068 --> 29:20.234
Trevor, Morgan, Allenby--

29:20.236 --> 29:21.619
Dirty 30s
are attacking us?

29:21.621 --> 29:23.404
Amanda.
She's got Shop money now.

29:23.406 --> 29:24.772
She can afford them.

29:24.774 --> 29:26.073
Let's get them away
from medical.

29:50.682 --> 29:52.266
Fall back!

30:21.096 --> 30:23.097
How you like me now?

30:23.099 --> 30:24.665
Clear!

30:32.057 --> 30:33.474
I'm out.

30:33.476 --> 30:34.942
Me too.

30:37.029 --> 30:40.531
I got three rounds.

30:40.533 --> 30:43.985
Make them count.

30:43.987 --> 30:46.237
Draw them up top.

30:46.239 --> 30:48.656
We'll flank 'em.

30:48.658 --> 30:51.993
I got something
I want to say.

30:51.995 --> 30:54.362
I never liked you guys.

30:56.531 --> 31:00.501
Well, then,
you got nothing to lose.

32:44.156 --> 32:46.023
We'll be fine.
Go.

32:46.025 --> 32:47.858
Go.

32:55.868 --> 32:57.451
He's been down
for so long.

32:57.453 --> 32:59.036
I don't know
if his body's strong enough.

32:59.038 --> 33:00.504
All right.
Okay.

33:00.506 --> 33:05.325
He's strong enough.
Come on, Michael.

33:05.327 --> 33:06.761
Give him the adrenaline.
Now.

33:11.133 --> 33:14.301
Michael.
Michael.

33:14.303 --> 33:16.670
Do you remember
when I told you

33:16.672 --> 33:19.640
that you were the strongest
person I'd ever met?

33:24.679 --> 33:27.281
We were standing
in the snow.

33:27.283 --> 33:30.701
We'd just gotten Kasim,

33:30.703 --> 33:34.155
and you told me
about the life he took from you.

33:34.157 --> 33:36.123
And I thought,

33:36.125 --> 33:40.661
how could anyone
survive that?

33:40.663 --> 33:41.796
You did.

33:41.798 --> 33:43.998
You did.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.083
And then you saved me, too.

33:46.085 --> 33:54.325
♪

33:57.345 --> 33:59.313
Michael, you pulled me
out of the darkness

33:59.315 --> 34:01.182
when there was no other way.

34:01.184 --> 34:06.437
And I need you to be strong
for me right now.

34:06.439 --> 34:10.524
If you want to save me...

34:10.525 --> 34:13.527
Save yourself.

34:13.529 --> 34:15.967
Please.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.199
Please.

34:52.900 --> 34:55.034
All of you
went through that?

35:01.109 --> 35:09.383
♪

36:38.620 --> 36:39.870
As the nation continues

36:39.872 --> 36:42.056
to mourn
President Spencer's death,

36:42.057 --> 36:43.640
the country's
law enforcement agencies

36:43.642 --> 36:46.810
have launched
the largest manhunt in history

36:46.812 --> 36:49.062
as they begin the search
for the assassin.

36:49.064 --> 36:51.982
The Secret Service has released
the following description.

36:51.984 --> 36:55.352
Female, dark hair,
roughly 5'7".

36:55.354 --> 36:57.637
They've also
released an image,

36:57.639 --> 37:00.490
taken from security camera
footage within the White House.

37:00.492 --> 37:03.109
The image is grainy,
but take a close look.

37:03.111 --> 37:05.945
If you have any information
regarding this person,

37:05.947 --> 37:08.832
you are asked
to contact local authorities.

37:08.834 --> 37:10.116
We're going
to clear your name.

37:10.118 --> 37:11.918
No question.
They got nothing.

37:11.920 --> 37:13.986
That could be Bigfoot.

37:13.988 --> 37:15.689
They'll find
a better image.

37:15.691 --> 37:17.323
We'll expose the truth
before that happens.

37:17.325 --> 37:19.125
The problem will be
getting people to believe it.

37:19.127 --> 37:21.127
I know the truth,
and I can hardly believe it.

37:21.129 --> 37:22.712
That's why we need
to get to the bottom

37:22.714 --> 37:24.163
of what's really
going on...

37:24.165 --> 37:25.932
Find out why Amanda
and the group

37:25.934 --> 37:27.384
wanted the President dead,

37:27.386 --> 37:29.686
how they made her
commit suicide.

37:29.688 --> 37:33.356
Those answers are what's going
to clear Nikita's name.

37:33.358 --> 37:35.692
We'll need somewhere
to work from.

37:35.694 --> 37:37.727
Do you think maybe you could
convince your hacker buddies

37:37.729 --> 37:39.896
to let us use this place
for a while?

37:39.898 --> 37:41.364
We're going
to need a safehouse,

37:41.366 --> 37:44.901
since we lost
those presidential pardons.

37:44.903 --> 37:49.205
I'm putting you all
in the line of fire.

37:49.207 --> 37:51.023
We can handle it.

37:51.025 --> 37:52.625
No.
This will be heat

37:52.627 --> 37:54.377
like we've never seen before.

37:54.379 --> 37:56.413
Bring it on.

37:56.415 --> 37:59.799
Nikita,
we can beat this.

37:59.801 --> 38:01.718
I was ready to die today,

38:01.720 --> 38:05.088
but you and Alex and everyone
refused to let that happen.

38:07.174 --> 38:09.275
You remember
when Amanda tried to teach us

38:09.277 --> 38:13.763
that our loved ones
were a liability?

38:13.765 --> 38:17.383
Well, it's a good thing
you've got more than one.

38:28.612 --> 38:30.163
Okay.

38:35.753 --> 38:38.121
Till death do us part,
right?

38:50.551 --> 38:51.885
A toast

38:51.887 --> 38:55.305
to a successful beginning.

38:57.090 --> 38:58.808
Nikita's still alive.

38:58.810 --> 39:00.360
We tend not
to view these things

39:00.362 --> 39:03.062
as zero-sum games.

39:03.064 --> 39:04.948
What needed
to happen happened.

39:04.950 --> 39:06.649
The President is dead.

39:06.651 --> 39:08.768
At least,
to the outside world.

39:16.076 --> 39:17.327
You should know
that I am worthless

39:17.329 --> 39:18.945
as a hostage.

39:18.947 --> 39:23.500
The United States will not
negotiate with terrorists.

39:23.502 --> 39:25.284
Typical of an American

39:25.286 --> 39:28.121
to think she's being held
as some type of leverage.

39:28.123 --> 39:29.756
It is understandable.

39:29.758 --> 39:32.008
Grabbing her, as you did,
at the G20,

39:32.010 --> 39:35.294
she probably suspects
some foreign enemy.

39:35.296 --> 39:37.347
It could all come
crashing down

39:37.349 --> 39:38.731
because of Nikita.

39:38.733 --> 39:41.133
We could release
a clearer image,

39:41.135 --> 39:42.986
make sure people know
who they're chasing.

39:42.988 --> 39:45.772
No, meddling now would
raise too many questions.

39:45.774 --> 39:48.158
Remember,
we are the Invisible Hand.

39:48.160 --> 39:51.694
Nikita has a habit
of chopping off hands.

39:51.696 --> 39:55.865
Then we shall
grow another.

39:55.867 --> 39:57.283
These are all
Shop facilities.

39:57.285 --> 39:59.335
- Yup.
- A lot of these locations

39:59.337 --> 40:02.322
correspond to known hubs
for human trafficking.

40:04.758 --> 40:07.177
Maryam Hasan offered me
a position at the U.N.

40:07.179 --> 40:10.380
to work on the global
trafficking problem.

40:10.382 --> 40:12.549
If I took it,
I'd have the influence and cover

40:12.551 --> 40:14.717
to get us
into a lot of these places.

40:14.719 --> 40:16.352
You want
to be a diplomat?

40:16.354 --> 40:18.221
It'd be a chance

40:18.223 --> 40:21.891
for Alexandra Udinov
to do some good.

40:21.893 --> 40:23.175
Make the name
into something

40:23.177 --> 40:24.444
that I could finally
be proud of.

40:24.446 --> 40:25.678
And it'll help us

40:25.680 --> 40:27.230
nail the people
working with Amanda

40:27.232 --> 40:31.901
and get us closer
to clearing Nikita's name.

40:31.903 --> 40:36.355
That's not a bad strategy.

40:36.357 --> 40:38.524
Nikita?

40:41.045 --> 40:44.130
She was right here.

40:54.592 --> 40:55.875
Come on, Nikita.

40:55.877 --> 40:57.710
Answer your damn phone.

41:06.020 --> 41:09.405
Answer, damn it.

41:09.407 --> 41:13.393
Answer your phone.
