WEBVTT

00:27.583 --> 00:28.416
Good morning.

00:29.333 --> 00:30.166
Morning.

00:33.458 --> 00:34.291
What?

00:35.833 --> 00:37.041
It's pretty strange

00:37.791 --> 00:39.291
waking up here with you.

00:39.375 --> 00:40.875
Is that good or bad?

00:45.875 --> 00:47.041
Not bad at all.

00:49.125 --> 00:52.375
Nice having you here.
I could almost get used to it.

00:54.750 --> 00:56.458
Yeah, almost.

01:00.708 --> 01:04.875
-Maybe you should talk to Vanessa first.
-I will. Okay? I promise.

01:06.333 --> 01:07.833
Want some breakfast?

01:09.166 --> 01:10.750
Thanks, but I have to go.

01:13.125 --> 01:16.833
Okay, you probably need
to go home before the show.

01:19.041 --> 01:20.833
It'll turn out good, trust me.

01:24.250 --> 01:27.250
Be right back.
I'll just get us something to drink.

01:41.458 --> 01:44.250
<i>Hey, Lisi. I sent the video.</i>

01:46.083 --> 01:48.541
<i>I wanted to say</i>
<i>I've only known you for a short time,</i>

01:48.625 --> 01:51.916
<i>but in that short time,</i>
<i>you've become a really good friend.</i>

01:52.000 --> 01:53.041
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:53.541 --> 01:55.458
<i>We have to celebrate that, okay?</i>

02:17.833 --> 02:22.916
HANS, I AM SO SORRY. I REALLY

02:55.166 --> 02:56.375
Are you coming back?

02:56.458 --> 02:59.666
<i>Sweetie, we're still waiting</i>
<i>for the drinking water.</i>

02:59.750 --> 03:01.333
<i>The kids need me here.</i>

03:01.416 --> 03:02.833
Of course, I understand.

03:03.458 --> 03:04.625
<i>And how are you?</i>

03:04.708 --> 03:05.625
Me?

03:06.375 --> 03:07.291
I'm good.

03:10.125 --> 03:11.041
Very good.

03:11.125 --> 03:13.875
<i>-Glad to hear that.</i>
-I'm at the hotel in Kitz.

03:14.375 --> 03:15.791
<i>That was his pride and joy.</i>

03:15.875 --> 03:17.791
It feels weird here without him.

03:17.875 --> 03:21.708
<i>Kosh, I'm afraid I need to go.</i>
<i>Take care of yourself, okay?</i>

03:21.791 --> 03:22.708
Yeah.

03:22.791 --> 03:24.000
I will.

03:24.083 --> 03:25.916
<i>I'll be in touch. I promise.</i>

03:26.000 --> 03:27.500
Okay, see you.

03:27.583 --> 03:28.666
<i>Bye.</i>

03:28.750 --> 03:29.708
Bye, Mom.

03:45.250 --> 03:46.083
Hey.

03:46.166 --> 03:49.250
<i>Koshi, I've been trying</i>
<i>to call you all night.</i>

03:49.750 --> 03:50.791
<i>I need you.</i>

03:52.583 --> 03:54.250
My mom will be so happy

03:54.333 --> 03:56.625
that we can use your dress after all.

03:57.250 --> 03:58.125
Here.

04:03.916 --> 04:07.500
-Promise me that Vanessa won't have it on.
-Of course.

04:10.208 --> 04:12.041
I need to be able to trust you.

04:13.041 --> 04:14.041
I promise.

04:14.708 --> 04:15.666
Good.

04:16.708 --> 04:17.666
Wait.

04:26.708 --> 04:27.541
For London.

04:31.625 --> 04:32.458
Thank you.

04:46.416 --> 04:48.208
-Morning.
-Morning.

04:49.041 --> 04:50.958
By the way, Lisi came by last night

04:51.041 --> 04:53.666
and dropped off her dress
for the fashion show.

04:53.750 --> 04:55.083
She says hello.

04:55.625 --> 04:58.333
Great. Where's Vanessa, by the way?

04:59.958 --> 05:01.250
At home, I think.

05:01.333 --> 05:03.500
So it was someone else
who spent the night?

05:06.291 --> 05:07.541
Are you spying on me?

05:07.625 --> 05:09.791
I'm not spying. I live here.

05:09.875 --> 05:11.333
It's none of your business.

05:11.416 --> 05:13.291
It is when it affects my work.

05:18.208 --> 05:20.166
I took Conny's offer, by the way.

05:22.166 --> 05:24.666
-Really?
-I'm starting next semester.

05:29.125 --> 05:32.208
See? Sleeping with Conny
paid off after all.

05:39.083 --> 05:42.500
Just so we're clear,
Conny's been my lover for three years.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.083
If I sleep with him,
it's because I enjoy it.

05:49.291 --> 05:51.333
And that's none of <i>your </i>business.

06:01.208 --> 06:02.125
Mr. Ziervogel.

06:04.083 --> 06:05.375
Is everything all right?

06:17.541 --> 06:21.333
-How well did you know my father?
-I knew him somewhat.

06:23.500 --> 06:24.833
What was he like?

06:25.833 --> 06:27.625
A very impressive man.

06:29.250 --> 06:30.875
And not exactly uncomplicated.

06:30.958 --> 06:34.000
Are we at all

06:35.500 --> 06:36.541
similar?

06:38.375 --> 06:41.625
Don't take this the wrong way.
I held him in very high regard.

06:42.708 --> 06:46.083
But I thought certain people
had to be protected from him,

06:48.125 --> 06:51.541
whereas I think
you need to be protected from yourself.

06:52.625 --> 06:53.458
Why?

06:54.541 --> 06:56.458
You're a sensitive guy.

06:56.541 --> 06:57.833
You're generous.

06:58.458 --> 06:59.750
You like people.

07:03.041 --> 07:05.625
Now you just have
to learn to like yourself too.

07:20.250 --> 07:21.166
-Hey.
-Hey.

07:24.583 --> 07:25.916
Are you all right?

07:27.583 --> 07:28.750
I'm fine.

07:35.750 --> 07:36.875
Did something happen?

07:38.625 --> 07:39.458
It was nothing.

07:43.041 --> 07:44.416
It doesn't look like nothing.

07:51.416 --> 07:52.458
Just tell me.

07:56.125 --> 07:58.083
I got into a fight with my parents.

08:01.125 --> 08:02.000
And with Kosh.

08:03.125 --> 08:04.625
He treated me like shit.

08:05.541 --> 08:09.333
I totally opened up to him,
and he just laughed at me, Lisi.

08:10.041 --> 08:11.333
He laughed at you?

08:12.958 --> 08:14.500
He was just toying with me.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.250
Just like Vanessa did to Joseph.

08:17.750 --> 08:20.291
I'm just his plaything, his farmer boy.

08:21.958 --> 08:24.500
Now that he has it,
he doesn't want it anymore.

08:26.625 --> 08:27.458
I think

08:29.291 --> 08:31.416
he just doesn't like himself.

08:33.416 --> 08:35.875
And feels overwhelmed
when someone opens up to him.

08:35.958 --> 08:37.708
Why are you taking Kosh's side?

08:37.791 --> 08:39.000
I'm not.

08:40.208 --> 08:41.208
It's…

08:41.291 --> 08:44.375
Getting involved with someone
is good for you.

08:45.625 --> 08:46.916
Even if it hurts.

08:58.791 --> 09:00.291
What's going on with you?

09:01.333 --> 09:02.750
What do you mean?

09:02.833 --> 09:04.625
That's enough waiting, Lisi.

09:05.125 --> 09:06.333
Just post the video.

09:07.416 --> 09:08.250
I'll do it.

09:27.958 --> 09:29.958
<i>Who secures your livelihoods?</i>

09:31.416 --> 09:32.791
<i>You hypocritical pigs--</i>

09:33.791 --> 09:35.791
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

10:03.125 --> 10:06.000
-What's wrong?
-This damned thing's acting up again.

10:07.333 --> 10:09.708
-Should I take a look?
-It's no use.

10:09.791 --> 10:13.041
-We need to call someone.
-Mom, please wait.

10:15.958 --> 10:17.333
Why didn't you tell me?

10:22.083 --> 10:24.166
It was all so tricky with your dad.

10:26.833 --> 10:29.541
And Ludwig asked me out, spoiled me.

10:30.583 --> 10:32.375
He promised me the world.

10:33.625 --> 10:35.125
This was all new to me.

10:36.541 --> 10:37.541
And then,

10:39.083 --> 10:40.708
once the slope was his,

10:41.916 --> 10:43.625
it was suddenly over for us.

10:44.916 --> 10:46.916
Do you know how ashamed I felt?

10:48.291 --> 10:50.000
-And still feel.
-Mom, please.

10:56.583 --> 10:58.375
<i>This is my sister, Lisi.</i>

10:59.583 --> 11:01.916
<i>She's sewing my new jersey. Right?</i>

11:02.000 --> 11:04.541
<i>-You'd love that.</i>
<i>-I'm just kidding.</i>

11:04.625 --> 11:07.541
<i>She's our artist.</i>
<i>She'll be the next Valerie Westwood.</i>

11:07.625 --> 11:08.541
No time for that.

11:08.625 --> 11:10.708
<i>-Vivienne Westwood.</i>
<i>-Sorry.</i>

11:10.791 --> 11:12.416
We still need a solution.

11:12.958 --> 11:16.875
-You take an interest in him once a year.
-Of course, you accuse me of that.

11:17.791 --> 11:19.750
Afterward, he's always totally rattled.

11:19.833 --> 11:22.666
A few honest words here and there
are good for him.

11:22.750 --> 11:23.916
Here and there?

11:24.000 --> 11:27.291
I'm always here. Always! And I provide.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.833
Maybe that's the problem.

11:29.916 --> 11:30.791
Excuse me?

11:30.875 --> 11:33.708
It's no wonder the boy isn't independent!

11:34.583 --> 11:37.041
So it's my fault
he didn't get into university?

11:37.125 --> 11:38.166
Did I get that right?

11:38.250 --> 11:39.375
So now you send him

11:39.458 --> 11:41.958
to your great design guru's
private school.

11:42.041 --> 11:44.041
I'm trying to open doors for him.

11:44.125 --> 11:46.833
How's Dominik going
to get his self-confidence?

11:47.375 --> 11:49.208
If you open every door for him?

11:49.291 --> 11:51.708
But at least I care about him.

11:51.791 --> 11:54.458
And I don't care about our son,
is that it?

11:55.250 --> 11:58.416
I'm just saying,
I never took any shortcuts in life.

11:58.500 --> 11:59.708
Yeah, I know.

11:59.791 --> 12:01.625
You had it real hard.

12:02.791 --> 12:06.458
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a show to prepare.

12:18.666 --> 12:19.666
Wait, Hans.

12:20.666 --> 12:22.791
Sit with me for a minute, will you?

12:35.750 --> 12:38.458
You see, when your mom and I got married,

12:38.541 --> 12:41.208
it was more of a practical decision.

12:41.291 --> 12:43.250
Less of a decision based on love.

12:44.583 --> 12:45.916
On her part, at least.

12:49.208 --> 12:52.000
And when that thing
with Ziervogel happened…

12:52.500 --> 12:55.791
Of course, it hurt like hell.

12:55.875 --> 12:57.375
I can tell you that much.

12:58.416 --> 13:00.500
But I was there for her

13:00.583 --> 13:02.166
because I loved her.

13:02.916 --> 13:06.250
And I think it opened your mom's eyes.

13:06.333 --> 13:08.500
Because without that, most likely,

13:09.333 --> 13:12.375
she would have never truly seen me,
you know?

13:14.833 --> 13:15.750
You know, Hans,

13:17.375 --> 13:19.375
there are no certainties in love.

13:21.500 --> 13:24.458
You just have to try it out.

13:25.375 --> 13:28.875
Even if it knocks you on your ass.

13:39.250 --> 13:40.958
Chardonnay for breakfast?

13:42.750 --> 13:43.583
Nice.

13:46.541 --> 13:48.541
Why aren't you answering your phone?

13:50.541 --> 13:52.416
I was busy, sorry.

13:56.708 --> 13:58.208
Dominik's cheating on me.

13:59.750 --> 14:00.583
Nessa.

14:01.583 --> 14:02.708
Another glass!

14:04.458 --> 14:05.500
With Lisi.

14:05.583 --> 14:07.333
That little bitch.

14:08.833 --> 14:09.791
Are you sure?

14:11.916 --> 14:15.833
At first, I thought he'd found out
about Joseph and me after all.

14:15.916 --> 14:18.708
And he was getting revenge,
but I don't think he knows.

14:18.791 --> 14:19.750
Joseph?

14:20.875 --> 14:22.083
Lisi's brother?

14:22.708 --> 14:24.041
Yeah, we had a thing.

14:25.125 --> 14:25.958
Really?

14:28.041 --> 14:28.875
Crazy.

14:31.916 --> 14:34.333
Why does everyone hate me, Kosh?

14:37.125 --> 14:38.583
I don't hate you.

14:39.333 --> 14:40.458
Not you.

14:42.333 --> 14:43.166
No, thanks.

14:45.125 --> 14:46.250
Come on.

14:46.333 --> 14:47.500
Drink with me.

14:48.458 --> 14:49.750
I don't drink anymore.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.958
-Since when? Yesterday?
-Yeah, since yesterday.

14:54.958 --> 14:58.125
Can you make an exception?
Don't leave me hanging.

14:59.916 --> 15:01.041
But I am here.

15:01.125 --> 15:02.000
Yes, I know.

15:03.250 --> 15:07.375
But right now I need fun Kosh,
not sober Kosh.

15:08.958 --> 15:11.375
-Do you at least have some blow on you?
-No!

15:11.458 --> 15:13.166
Can you call Wirsing, please?

15:15.041 --> 15:16.083
Don't you get it?

15:16.166 --> 15:17.625
I get it, Kosh!

15:17.708 --> 15:20.541
I think it's great
that you're clean and whatnot,

15:20.625 --> 15:22.500
but I really need you now.

15:22.583 --> 15:25.958
First, you worry about me and my drug use
and end our friendship.

15:26.041 --> 15:27.833
Now you want me to call Wirsing?

15:27.916 --> 15:31.333
-Do you realize what you're doing?
-Please don't yell at me now.

15:33.250 --> 15:35.333
You want to know why everyone hates you?

15:36.333 --> 15:39.500
Since I've been here,
you haven't asked how I'm doing once.

15:53.750 --> 15:55.083
KOSH
I'M SORRY!

15:57.583 --> 15:59.416
REALLY SORRY!

15:59.500 --> 16:01.833
HAVE TO GO TO THIS FASHION SHOW.
WANNA COME TOO?

16:01.916 --> 16:04.083
PLEASE. I WANT TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

16:20.625 --> 16:21.916
Card or wristband?

16:22.000 --> 16:24.791
-My friends are already inside.
-No wristband, no entry.

16:24.875 --> 16:27.833
-I should be on the list for Ziervogel.
-He's with me.

16:30.833 --> 16:32.291
-Okay.
-That works.

16:32.375 --> 16:33.333
Enjoy the show.

16:34.750 --> 16:36.750
Cool! What brings you here?

16:36.833 --> 16:38.916
Me? I could ask you the same thing.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.666
What's going on with you?

16:40.750 --> 16:42.833
-I'll tell you later.
-Hansi, hello!

16:44.625 --> 16:47.291
Hey, Kosh. Have you seen Vanessa anywhere?

16:48.041 --> 16:50.916
She's probably mad at you
after the whole Lisi thing.

16:51.541 --> 16:52.541
What do you mean?

16:53.708 --> 16:54.583
Lisi,

16:55.166 --> 16:56.833
I underestimated you.

16:57.708 --> 16:58.916
Dominik, can we talk?

17:10.416 --> 17:11.791
Hey, you came.

17:11.875 --> 17:12.875
I, well…

17:14.791 --> 17:18.541
-What's going on with Lisi and Dominik?
-Didn't she tell you?

17:19.625 --> 17:22.250
-What's Kosh talking about?
-I have no idea!

17:22.916 --> 17:25.708
-I'll go and talk to Vanessa. I--
-Please don't.

17:26.291 --> 17:29.041
-I should've done that long ago.
-I'll do it when I find her.

17:30.625 --> 17:36.041
DOMINIK
WHERE ARE YOU? CAN WE PLEASE TALK?

17:36.125 --> 17:38.250
You can fuck off once and for all.

17:43.375 --> 17:44.583
Vanessa, darling.

17:45.833 --> 17:46.666
Are you ready?

17:48.958 --> 17:50.416
Is something wrong, sweetie?

17:51.375 --> 17:52.541
I'm not your sweetie.

17:54.041 --> 17:55.708
Fine, then you're not.

17:56.666 --> 17:58.791
But get going, we're about to start.

17:58.875 --> 18:02.250
Why do you think you can just come in
and tell me what to do?

18:02.333 --> 18:04.250
Because that's my job, Vanessa.

18:04.875 --> 18:08.666
-If I were you, I'd be glad about that.
-I'm sick of all of this shit.

18:09.416 --> 18:10.666
You can all go to hell.

18:10.750 --> 18:13.208
We need to talk then. But after the show.

18:13.875 --> 18:16.791
As long as your contract is in effect,
you'll do as I say.

18:16.875 --> 18:19.583
That's why you'll go out
there now and deliver.

18:20.208 --> 18:21.041
Please.

18:57.333 --> 18:59.791
You and Dominik? Why didn't you tell me?

18:59.875 --> 19:02.250
-I wanted to tell you, really.
-But what?

19:02.333 --> 19:04.791
Lisi, your dress
will be a highlight today.

19:05.458 --> 19:08.333
So happy we get to present it.
I hope you are too.

19:08.416 --> 19:10.916
-Thank you for the opportunity.
-Of course.

19:12.291 --> 19:14.000
I see. That's your angle.

19:14.875 --> 19:18.333
That's why the video isn't up yet.
You want to build your career.

19:19.125 --> 19:21.666
That's total bullshit, and you know it.

19:21.750 --> 19:22.833
No, I don't.

19:23.416 --> 19:24.291
Sorry.

19:30.333 --> 19:31.875
Hans, where are you going?

19:32.375 --> 19:34.583
-Home.
-You just got here.

19:35.416 --> 19:37.458
-I just don't belong here.
-Stay.

19:38.083 --> 19:39.333
Now, all of a sudden?

19:43.333 --> 19:44.291
I'm sorry.

19:48.916 --> 19:52.458
You opened up to me, and I hurt you.
You didn't deserve that.

19:53.750 --> 19:54.958
No, I didn't.

19:57.083 --> 19:59.083
I don't know what's up with me either.

19:59.750 --> 20:03.750
I was just thinking, "Why am I doing this?
Why am I such an asshole?"

20:04.416 --> 20:06.916
And then,
"How could you love an asshole like me?

20:07.000 --> 20:09.041
You'd have to be an asshole too."

20:09.833 --> 20:10.666
Thanks.

20:12.250 --> 20:14.041
No, you're not an asshole.

20:15.083 --> 20:16.458
The opposite, actually.

20:16.541 --> 20:20.083
You're the first person
who makes me feel at home.

20:26.666 --> 20:29.750
-Let's get out of here.
-Please. This place isn't me.

20:29.833 --> 20:31.416
I mean <i>really </i>get out of here.

20:32.500 --> 20:34.916
Just you and me.
We'll hop on the next plane.

20:36.458 --> 20:37.416
I can't do that.

20:38.750 --> 20:41.750
Tomorrow we'll look for a temp
to do your work.

20:43.250 --> 20:46.666
I'm buying your freedom. Hans unchained.

21:24.500 --> 21:25.416
Lisi.

21:26.208 --> 21:27.041
Excuse me.

21:27.750 --> 21:31.625
Vanessa's in the dressing room,
but I'll definitely talk to her afterward.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.583
Until then, you'll give interviews.

21:33.666 --> 21:36.500
They'll all want to know
who designed that amazing dress.

21:39.583 --> 21:40.416
Hey.

21:41.625 --> 21:42.958
It'll be all right.

21:49.208 --> 21:50.458
Dear guests,

21:50.958 --> 21:54.416
I'm absolutely delighted
that so many of you could make it.

21:54.500 --> 21:58.250
Under the slogan "Fashion for Future,"
we've put together a high-end show

21:58.333 --> 22:02.541
of prestigious
and upcoming designers for you.

22:02.625 --> 22:05.083
All pieces can be purchased afterward.

22:05.166 --> 22:08.458
100% of the proceeds
will go to environmental protection,

22:08.541 --> 22:11.875
so our beautiful Alps
can remain sustainable.

23:10.916 --> 23:14.375
-Was that really necessary?
-I could ask you the same thing.

23:14.458 --> 23:17.125
Okay, then let's discuss this like adults.

23:17.916 --> 23:19.583
Suddenly, we're adults now?

23:19.666 --> 23:23.916
You're the one acting like a child
because I'm the one building a career.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.250
What? You think
the whole world revolves around you!

23:27.333 --> 23:30.708
You don't give a shit about others
as long as you get what you want.

23:31.208 --> 23:32.958
You wanna bang the ski instructor?

23:33.916 --> 23:35.541
You just do it. Of course.

23:36.083 --> 23:38.000
I'm not as dumb as you think I am.

23:38.500 --> 23:41.208
So you have to bang his sister?
So we're even?

23:41.291 --> 23:42.916
You cheated on me first!

23:43.416 --> 23:45.541
Maybe you have something to do with that?

23:45.625 --> 23:48.208
So now it's my fault
that you cheated on me?

23:48.708 --> 23:50.916
I made a mistake, but I fought for us!

23:51.000 --> 23:55.208
Yeah, after he died!
That's when it became a mistake to you!

23:57.041 --> 23:57.875
Lisi.

23:58.833 --> 24:00.875
Great, now we're all here.

24:03.041 --> 24:04.125
I trusted you.

24:04.708 --> 24:09.250
-I thought you were like your brother.
-You don't get to talk about him.

24:10.166 --> 24:11.541
You just used him.

24:11.625 --> 24:14.166
You have no idea what went on between us.

24:14.250 --> 24:15.833
Neither of you.

24:15.916 --> 24:17.291
I loved him.

24:17.875 --> 24:21.541
You just toyed with him.
And now he's dead because of you.

24:21.625 --> 24:23.500
What the fuck are you talking about?

24:23.583 --> 24:25.291
You know what I'm talking about.

24:26.541 --> 24:29.416
And you'll be sorry.
I can promise you that.

24:35.375 --> 24:37.250
-You two deserve each other!
-Lisi!

24:37.333 --> 24:38.541
Just leave me alone!

25:06.291 --> 25:08.416
Hey, Lisi. How was the fashion show?

25:23.500 --> 25:24.666
INSULT OR ART?

Dominik, I'm really worried about Vanessa.
Have you talked to her?

27:19.666 --> 27:22.458
-That video is everywhere.
-What video?

28:29.833 --> 28:35.625
I NEED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING IMPORTANT.
IT'S ABOUT YOUR BROTHER…

29:01.958 --> 29:02.791
Hey!

29:06.916 --> 29:09.875
Too scared to get out of your bougie car?

29:09.958 --> 29:11.958
-Yeah!
-Hey.

29:13.791 --> 29:15.958
Dude, that's her boyfriend?

29:16.041 --> 29:19.666
-For real?
-Get out, man! Come out!

29:19.750 --> 29:21.250
Come on out!

29:24.833 --> 29:27.041
Come on, get out!

29:27.125 --> 29:28.583
Come on, get out!

29:32.083 --> 29:34.166
Not so brave now, are you? Get out!

29:54.416 --> 29:55.833
He's scared to death!

30:34.000 --> 30:35.666
I know you were behind it.

30:55.791 --> 30:56.791
Shit!

30:57.625 --> 30:58.708
Dude!

30:59.291 --> 31:01.291
Hey, Vanessa! Let us in!

31:05.375 --> 31:06.666
Come on. Climb over.

31:11.625 --> 31:15.458
When you said before
that Joseph's death was my fault

31:15.541 --> 31:17.458
and that I'd regret it all,

31:18.041 --> 31:19.833
a light bulb went off.

31:22.750 --> 31:24.458
You were behind it all.

31:26.333 --> 31:27.333
The flowers,

31:28.083 --> 31:29.125
the Burgtheater,

31:29.208 --> 31:30.291
the video.

31:31.333 --> 31:33.291
You want revenge or some shit.

31:33.375 --> 31:35.583
What did you want to tell me about Joseph?

31:36.166 --> 31:37.083
Nothing.

31:37.916 --> 31:39.666
I just wanted you to come

31:39.750 --> 31:42.833
so that I could look you
straight in your lying face.

31:44.125 --> 31:46.250
I have no idea why you think this,

31:46.333 --> 31:48.666
but I had nothing to do with his death.

31:49.625 --> 31:51.250
You just don't get it, do you?

31:52.250 --> 31:55.333
You've never thought
your actions had consequences.

31:55.416 --> 31:57.041
What are you talking about?

31:59.291 --> 32:01.000
I read the messages.

32:02.583 --> 32:04.708
And he called me. That night.

32:05.833 --> 32:08.041
You drove Joseph to his death.

32:08.125 --> 32:11.375
You destroyed my family,
and you just don't care at all.

32:11.875 --> 32:13.125
What are you talking about?

32:14.041 --> 32:15.083
This video

32:16.166 --> 32:17.625
destroyed my life.

32:18.291 --> 32:19.125
Yeah.

32:21.500 --> 32:22.583
And you know what?

32:24.500 --> 32:26.041
I'd do it all over again.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.291
I have no idea what fantasies

32:34.375 --> 32:37.250
you've cooked up
in that deranged brain of yours.

32:39.041 --> 32:40.416
But at least…

32:43.916 --> 32:45.666
I have your confession now.

32:46.458 --> 32:47.833
I will end you.

32:47.916 --> 32:49.541
-Give me the phone.
-No.

32:49.625 --> 32:50.916
-Give me the phone.
-No.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.708
Give me the fucking phone.

33:02.208 --> 33:03.250
Vanessa!

33:04.625 --> 33:05.916
Vanessa, let me in!

33:08.333 --> 33:10.125
Come on out!

33:11.000 --> 33:12.666
Your friends are here!

33:15.041 --> 33:18.041
Hey, Vanessa! Fuck you, bitch!

33:19.541 --> 33:20.916
Come on out!

33:21.416 --> 33:23.208
Come on, don't be shy!

33:24.500 --> 33:25.416
We've had enough!

33:25.500 --> 33:28.291
If you don't like it here,
go back to Munich!

33:29.916 --> 33:31.750
Shit. Fuck!

33:31.833 --> 33:33.208
-Fire.
-What are we gonna do?

33:35.291 --> 33:37.166
-Fuck, what now?
-I don't know.

33:37.250 --> 33:40.458
-Let's get out of here.
-Come on!

33:46.875 --> 33:49.458
I'll tell the police
and my dad's lawyer everything.

33:49.541 --> 33:52.583
-Yeah. No one will believe you.
-Yes, they will.

33:52.666 --> 33:54.750
They'll trace your email address.

33:54.833 --> 33:56.333
Give me the phone!

34:05.375 --> 34:06.666
Out!

34:09.791 --> 34:10.666
Shit!

34:14.125 --> 34:15.625
To the stairs!

34:18.750 --> 34:20.875
-Hey, ready for your weekend?
-Hey.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.166
That's Vanessa's chalet, isn't it?

34:33.250 --> 34:35.583
Shit. I have to go to the fire station.

34:38.125 --> 34:39.375
Shit.

34:43.916 --> 34:45.250
To the balcony, quick!

35:24.166 --> 35:25.250
Vanessa?

35:26.750 --> 35:27.875
Vanessa?

35:38.083 --> 35:39.541
-Lisi!
-Dominik.

35:41.250 --> 35:42.166
-Lisi!
-Vanessa!

35:42.791 --> 35:44.791
-Do you hear me?
-Vanessa, where are you?

35:44.875 --> 35:48.416
Lisi! Jump, damn it!
Jump. You need to get out of there.

35:48.500 --> 35:51.541
I'll catch you, okay? Just go slow.

35:52.916 --> 35:54.000
Be careful.

35:55.166 --> 35:56.666
Come on, I got you.

35:59.041 --> 36:01.875
Come on, Lisi! Go!

36:05.791 --> 36:06.833
Vanessa!

36:07.375 --> 36:08.541
Vanessa!

36:08.625 --> 36:11.125
Hey, where's Vanessa? Is she still inside?

36:11.208 --> 36:13.333
She was right behind me the whole time.

36:13.416 --> 36:14.833
-Vanessa!
-I'm going back in.

36:14.916 --> 36:17.208
-No! You can't.
-I have to. Vanessa!

36:17.875 --> 36:19.250
-Vanessa!
-Lisi, don't.

36:25.791 --> 36:26.958
Vanessa!

36:37.666 --> 36:39.666
FIRE DEPARTMENT

36:40.458 --> 36:42.333
Let's go, guys! This way!

36:42.416 --> 36:44.416
We can't block this access point.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.166
Everyone this way!

36:48.208 --> 36:50.208
Is anyone in there?

36:50.291 --> 36:51.291
Nessa.
