01:50.190 --> 01:52.323
How'd a water stain get there?

01:52.624 --> 01:55.726
It rained maybe twice
this last year.

01:57.263 --> 01:59.230
It's like everything's
papier-mÃ¢ché.

02:02.802 --> 02:04.936
Stop thinking.

02:06.471 --> 02:08.271
I don't like being on a ledge.

02:08.573 --> 02:11.475
Nobody gets rich
on their own money.

02:12.711 --> 02:14.712
I never really knew
what to do with it.

02:15.914 --> 02:18.282
Money.

02:20.118 --> 02:21.919
<i>I see that about myself.</i>

02:25.556 --> 02:28.926
You always said
you want lots of land.

02:29.093 --> 02:31.228
Yes,

02:31.562 --> 02:33.596
but you need children
to leave it to.

02:35.300 --> 02:37.467
It's never really yours.

02:37.768 --> 02:38.936
You don't take it with you.

02:39.270 --> 02:41.638
<i>You don't take
anything with you.</i>

02:41.939 --> 02:45.308
Just yourself,
whatever that was.

02:45.643 --> 02:49.479
I've worked my whole
life, same as you.

02:49.847 --> 02:53.149
And not being poor is
better than the opposite.

02:58.788 --> 03:00.823
My old man back in Chicago,

03:01.124 --> 03:03.960
when I was a kid...

03:04.361 --> 03:07.263
he used to lock me in the basement
when he'd go on a bender.

03:09.132 --> 03:10.666
Usually last the night.

03:10.934 --> 03:12.902
Let me out the next day.

03:13.270 --> 03:15.436
Thought he was keeping
me safe, I guess.

03:17.340 --> 03:19.941
This one time, I was six...

03:21.477 --> 03:23.678
he puts me down there

03:23.880 --> 03:26.381
and I wake up

03:26.615 --> 03:29.184
and it's locked.

03:29.451 --> 03:31.552
It had happened before.

03:33.021 --> 03:36.624
Anyways, I guess
he ended up arrested.

03:36.825 --> 03:37.825
I guess.

03:38.026 --> 03:39.527
God, baby.

03:39.795 --> 03:42.096
Well...

03:42.330 --> 03:44.331
by the second morning...

03:46.167 --> 03:47.734
I was out of food.

03:49.504 --> 03:53.007
The third day,
the lightbulb burned out.

03:55.010 --> 03:56.643
Pitch-black in there.

03:58.846 --> 04:00.881
That's when the rats
started coming out.

04:03.018 --> 04:04.750
I dozed off and...

04:06.520 --> 04:10.056
I felt the thing, you know,
nibbling my finger.

04:16.329 --> 04:18.231
I woke up.

04:18.531 --> 04:21.065
It was, you know,
chewing my finger.

04:23.702 --> 04:25.904
What did you do?

04:26.205 --> 04:28.873
I grabbed it in the dark
with my hands

04:29.108 --> 04:30.875
and I started smashing it.

04:32.745 --> 04:34.913
And I just kept smashing it...

04:36.950 --> 04:39.450
till it was nothing
but goo in my hands.

04:47.859 --> 04:49.726
Two more days I was in there...

04:51.363 --> 04:52.863
in the dark...

04:55.199 --> 04:57.067
till my dad comes home.

05:09.113 --> 05:12.448
Sometimes I wonder how many
things you have like that...

05:15.385 --> 05:17.419
that I don't know about.

05:18.588 --> 05:20.755
Ever since, I wondered

05:21.057 --> 05:23.292
what if he never comes home?

05:28.131 --> 05:29.498
What if I'm...

05:31.934 --> 05:35.036
still in that basement

05:35.237 --> 05:36.738
in the dark?

05:45.947 --> 05:47.515
What if I died there?

05:56.825 --> 05:58.326
That's what that reminds me of.

05:58.494 --> 06:00.161
<i>What?</i>

06:03.164 --> 06:04.864
That water stain.

06:07.668 --> 06:11.438
Something's trying
to tell me that

06:11.672 --> 06:13.673
it's all papier-mÃ¢ché.

06:15.609 --> 06:17.610
Something's telling me
to wake up.

06:19.846 --> 06:21.480
Like...

06:25.885 --> 06:27.520
like I'm not real.

06:29.722 --> 06:31.657
<i>Like I'm only dreaming.</i>

06:35.828 --> 06:39.031
TOD between 4:00 and 9:00 AM
morning of the 26th.

06:39.298 --> 06:42.000
Tox shows Xanax, alcohol,

06:42.334 --> 06:45.037
also had gonorrhea,
for what it's worth.

06:45.337 --> 06:46.939
Hydrochloric acid on his eyes.

06:47.306 --> 06:49.441
Burn pattern tells us
he was on his back.

06:49.742 --> 06:51.076
Lack of spray around
the orbital cavity

06:51.310 --> 06:52.444
indicates precision.

06:52.744 --> 06:55.213
Some kind of glass
eyedropper, maybe.

06:55.514 --> 06:57.014
He's our body.

06:57.449 --> 06:59.850
I don't see that changing, so
why don't you all fill me in?

07:00.186 --> 07:02.353
Victim is a key figure
in a state's investigation.

07:02.754 --> 07:04.489
- What state investigation?
<i>- Newly formed.</i>

07:04.790 --> 07:06.391
We're looking into
various allegations

07:06.659 --> 07:08.092
made against Vinci
in the papers.

07:08.627 --> 07:11.962
Vinci detectives have been on Caspere
as a missing person for two days.

07:12.330 --> 07:14.665
We have the man's house
which was burglarized.

07:14.933 --> 07:16.133
<i>You want to shut us out,</i>

07:16.501 --> 07:18.435
<i>we'll continue our
investigation autonomously.</i>

07:18.870 --> 07:21.772
In Vinci, so everybody can keep
their little corners to themselves,

07:22.140 --> 07:25.042
but, ladies and gentlemen,
PD is solving this case.

07:25.476 --> 07:29.346
I understand Ventura. How does
the state have any claim here?

07:29.647 --> 07:32.482
Our officer found the body.

07:32.983 --> 07:35.519
<i>This could get you out from under, Woodrugh.
That actress bullshit.</i>

07:35.853 --> 07:37.287
You'd be detailed
as a state's investigator.

07:37.722 --> 07:40.324
<i>The Caspere homicide
is your public investigation.</i>

07:40.725 --> 07:42.759
<i>Looking into Vinci PD</i>
<i>is your confidential mandate.</i>

07:43.060 --> 07:45.361
Gathering intel
for a grand jury.

07:45.796 --> 07:48.331
This probe is very important
to the governor's office.

07:48.565 --> 07:50.200
Say this goes your way.

07:50.567 --> 07:52.535
How's it play for my boy
here once the dust settles?

07:52.803 --> 07:54.804
Everything shakes out,

07:55.172 --> 07:57.540
you'll be offered a chance
to remain investigator.

07:57.875 --> 07:59.775
In line for a state
detective shield.

08:00.076 --> 08:02.645
<i>We can wipe away</i>
<i>all that admin hassle.</i>

08:02.879 --> 08:06.148
When this is over,

08:06.483 --> 08:09.385
can I just go back
to being on the bike?

08:09.819 --> 08:12.455
<i>You can see abrasions
on his wrists and ankles,</i>

08:12.689 --> 08:14.590
lividity on his torso.

08:14.858 --> 08:17.325
He was bound upside down.

08:17.560 --> 08:19.795
<i>Or close to it.</i>

08:20.196 --> 08:22.131
<i>Attorney general's
office has concerns</i>

08:22.498 --> 08:24.466
about obfuscation
on the part of Vinci PD.

08:24.934 --> 08:27.335
<i>Detective Bezzerides, you'll
be primary commander of the detail.</i>

08:27.703 --> 08:29.872
Secondary is gonna be
a Vinci guy, Velcoro.

08:30.206 --> 08:32.407
Your DB was into
a lot of LA County money.

08:32.775 --> 08:35.610
His house was broken into,
so you're going to Vinci.

08:35.943 --> 08:37.979
Vinci detective with you,
word is he's bent.

08:38.347 --> 08:40.715
Work him. Leverage
something to turn him.

08:41.082 --> 08:42.817
We'll have a full state
probe up inside a week.

08:43.184 --> 08:45.553
Caspere's death is a window
into everything.

08:45.854 --> 08:47.756
And what is everything exactly?

08:48.090 --> 08:49.690
You know anything
about the city of Vinci?

08:54.963 --> 08:58.632
<i>It started out as a
vice haven early 1900s.</i>

08:58.934 --> 09:01.269
<i>Went industrial in the '20s.</i>

09:01.636 --> 09:04.405
<i>Pushed out residents</i>
<i>from manufacturing zones.</i>

09:06.908 --> 09:09.042
<i>Worse air polluter</i>
<i>in the state.</i>

09:09.477 --> 09:13.814
<i>Annually emits or processes 27
million pounds of toxic waste.</i>

09:18.052 --> 09:19.953
<i>Reds tries
to stop my grandfather</i>

09:20.221 --> 09:22.122
<i>from industrial rezoning.</i>

09:22.323 --> 09:25.225
<i>Same thing.</i>

09:25.659 --> 09:28.728
<i>Geldof's been after us since
we won the last EPA suit.</i>

09:29.063 --> 09:31.898
It's about money,
Detective Velcoro.

09:32.266 --> 09:33.099
<i>Caspere was
one of the architects</i>

09:33.467 --> 09:34.500
<i>of the community</i>
<i>renewal initiative.</i>

09:34.836 --> 09:36.903
Passing legislature,
our city gets to keep

09:37.271 --> 09:40.840
75% of its county tax
revenue for eight years.

09:41.174 --> 09:42.908
- And what's that worth?
- <i>About $900 million.</i>

09:43.243 --> 09:44.610
Being kept from
the county general fund.

09:44.945 --> 09:46.078
<i>Hell, Ernst, it's our money.</i>

09:46.480 --> 09:49.449
Vinci's a goddamn success story
in a depressed economy.

09:49.950 --> 09:51.984
<i>State's gonna use the homicide
to dig into whatever they can, Ray.</i>

09:52.419 --> 09:55.254
Wherever the Caspere case goes,
we need you running point.

09:55.655 --> 09:58.324
Control the sprawl. Control
the flow of information.

09:58.658 --> 10:01.327
Dixon is secondary to you
staging out of Vinci.

10:01.828 --> 10:05.597
<i>You'll be working under a Ventura
detective commanding the task force.</i>

10:08.601 --> 10:10.069
That clear to you, Detective?

10:10.370 --> 10:12.738
10-4, Lieutenant.
Just one question.

10:13.038 --> 10:15.374
Am I supposed
to solve this or not?

10:19.144 --> 10:21.413
Just no surprises,
Detective Velcoro.

10:21.714 --> 10:24.349
Ray accepts dualities
must be effected

10:24.617 --> 10:28.253
<i>to serve public interests.</i>

10:28.453 --> 10:30.121
I really do.

10:32.191 --> 10:34.092
<i>- Bound?</i>
<i>- Vinyl fabric.</i>

10:34.493 --> 10:36.627
You can see the edge of the
buckle's imprint on both wrists.

10:36.828 --> 10:38.196
Tape residue.

10:38.563 --> 10:41.132
Pelvic wounds are from a
12-gauge at point-blank range.

10:41.466 --> 10:43.567
<i>Some kind</i>
<i>of Super-X heavy load.</i>

10:44.002 --> 10:46.737
<i>Came after the eye stuff.</i>
<i>Official COD is heart attack.</i>

10:47.038 --> 10:48.972
- <i>Trauma-induced.</i>
<i>- A coup de grace.</i>

10:49.340 --> 10:50.641
<i>Lividity
indicates he was placed</i>

10:50.975 --> 10:52.276
<i>in upright position</i>
<i>after death.</i>

10:52.577 --> 10:53.611
<i>Spent a few hours that way.</i>

10:53.912 --> 10:56.246
Nothing under his nails,
no prints.

10:56.481 --> 10:59.249
No trace at all?

11:07.491 --> 11:10.394
His eyes? What the fuck kind
of modus operandi is that?

11:10.694 --> 11:11.795
Doc said it was
hydrochloric acid.

11:12.063 --> 11:14.731
And a shotgun blast happened.

11:15.066 --> 11:17.567
Torture. Somebody wanted
to know something.

11:17.868 --> 11:18.668
Yeah, his house was tossed.

11:18.903 --> 11:21.538
Somebody's making a move.

11:21.839 --> 11:24.474
What?
What does that mean?

11:24.708 --> 11:26.108
You knew Caspere?

11:26.410 --> 11:28.478
There's deals
being done upstate.

11:28.846 --> 11:31.714
- A lot of money moving around.
- <i>What deals?</i>

11:32.182 --> 11:34.951
- You pull my string? Is that how this works?
- <i>Jesus, Frank.</i>

11:35.285 --> 11:36.718
The more I know, the better
I can deal with this.

11:36.954 --> 11:37.987
This is what you deal with.

11:38.388 --> 11:40.489
Caspere was important to
this thing I have going on.

11:40.757 --> 11:42.224
I've got to clean it up now.

11:42.592 --> 11:44.994
So you beat the bushes
until you figure it out.

11:45.395 --> 11:46.895
You ain't no sheriff's brownie.
You're a detective.

11:47.197 --> 11:48.864
Who's your best informant?

11:49.066 --> 11:50.298
Are you serious?

11:51.734 --> 11:52.935
Fucking hell, Raymond.

12:07.483 --> 12:10.352
<i>Leave!</i>

12:10.552 --> 12:11.252
<i>Leave!</i>

12:11.454 --> 12:13.588
<i>Danger!</i>

12:18.094 --> 12:20.428
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
Fuck me.

12:43.651 --> 12:46.553
<i>So good to see you.</i>

12:46.821 --> 12:48.655
Why don't you visit me more?

12:48.923 --> 12:51.058
Just busy.
The job.

12:51.426 --> 12:54.361
The job. We haven't
had dinner in ages.

12:54.662 --> 12:56.162
That's why I brought
you this, Ma.

12:56.497 --> 12:57.864
Don't give me that Ma shit.

12:58.198 --> 12:59.866
It's too late for us
to start all that now.

13:00.167 --> 13:02.268
Well, you ought
to eat something.

13:03.838 --> 13:05.171
Oh, I don't touch bread.

13:05.472 --> 13:07.306
Peel that skin off
for me, Paulie.

13:10.044 --> 13:12.111
So strong.

13:14.781 --> 13:17.517
I saw your old prom date
the other day.

13:17.717 --> 13:19.385
She got fat.

13:19.619 --> 13:20.753
I remember her.

13:21.055 --> 13:22.855
Couldn't wait to have
somebody's baby.

13:23.157 --> 13:26.159
She was nice.
She was nice to me.

13:28.162 --> 13:31.063
All the girls are nice
to you, Paulie.

13:31.364 --> 13:33.498
You haven't figured
that out by now?

13:37.671 --> 13:39.137
Want to stay tonight?

13:39.405 --> 13:40.773
We can watch a Clint movie.

13:41.041 --> 13:43.576
You can have your old room.

13:43.843 --> 13:45.544
I'm working on something.

13:45.878 --> 13:48.780
- Just came to see--
- Who is she, you scamp?

13:48.981 --> 13:51.616
You rake.

13:51.984 --> 13:54.252
You got hound's blood
just like your daddy.

13:54.554 --> 13:56.688
I'm not gonna
be around for a while.

13:57.022 --> 13:59.091
I've got to work
around LA and the coast.

14:01.060 --> 14:03.861
- Special detail.
- Mm.

14:04.162 --> 14:06.864
Then stay.
We can play cards.

14:07.165 --> 14:08.833
You can have your old room.

14:13.238 --> 14:15.106
You been getting any more shifts
at the restaurant lately?

14:18.043 --> 14:19.843
Not with my carpal tunnel.

14:20.112 --> 14:22.279
I'd lose my state check anyway.

14:22.680 --> 14:24.915
I thought Bill was letting
you work off the books.

14:25.283 --> 14:28.385
Oh, Bill? Don't talk to me
about that motherfucker.

14:32.190 --> 14:33.591
<i>Are you gonna give yourself up...</i>

14:33.858 --> 14:35.892
...or do this
the hard way?

14:36.227 --> 14:37.828
<i>There ain't no easy with me.</i>

14:38.062 --> 14:39.162
<i>You know that.</i>

14:39.463 --> 14:42.232
Damn. I so hate making a mess.

14:42.533 --> 14:44.134
A lot of paperwork, you know.

14:44.368 --> 14:46.103
It messes with you.

14:46.437 --> 14:49.239
<i>Screw you.</i>
<i>I did my time in prison.</i>

15:21.604 --> 15:23.873
We're listing contents
against insurance audits.

15:24.107 --> 15:25.774
See what was stolen.

15:27.977 --> 15:31.180
Well, somebody was looking for something.
Would explain the torture.

15:31.514 --> 15:34.283
Maybe. Guy really thought
about fucking a lot.

15:46.662 --> 15:48.296
Do you mind?

15:53.102 --> 15:54.769
Psychiatrist appointments.

15:55.004 --> 15:56.437
He was seeing a shrink.

15:56.839 --> 15:58.673
<i>We need to call every
appointment in that calendar.</i>

15:59.040 --> 16:02.510
Should check all those circled
dates against his GPS.

16:02.811 --> 16:05.479
<i>Yeah.</i>

16:11.653 --> 16:14.822
You pull off that e-cig.
Not a lot of people do.

16:15.156 --> 16:16.757
This place gets
a day-to-day influx

16:16.991 --> 16:19.126
of 70,000 people, right?

16:19.360 --> 16:20.660
Where do they live?

16:21.029 --> 16:23.563
I tried one once. It felt
like it was smoking me.

16:25.466 --> 16:27.300
A real cigarette wouldn't
make you feel like that.

16:30.071 --> 16:32.071
Maybe it was just
a little too close

16:32.406 --> 16:35.308
to sucking a robot's dick.
I don't know.

16:51.892 --> 16:53.592
Caspere was my
bank on this thing.

16:53.894 --> 16:55.494
My disposal company
set this up.

16:55.829 --> 16:57.496
Chemical runoff.
We took the risk.

16:57.931 --> 17:00.266
And that risk afforded you the
chance to buy into the corridor.

17:00.600 --> 17:02.468
But I'm telling you,
that buy was never made.

17:02.836 --> 17:05.371
Caspere had me down for 12
parcels below Monterey.

17:05.771 --> 17:08.339
Frank, I can only account for
what purchases Caspere completed.

17:08.708 --> 17:10.842
- Are you saying that I--
- Mr. McCandless,

17:11.243 --> 17:14.212
Mr. Caspere had effectively
sold Mr. Semyon the land

17:14.580 --> 17:16.348
<i>while acting as a
short-term holding company.</i>

17:16.750 --> 17:19.885
All we're trying to do is
ensure the deal for our parcel

17:20.219 --> 17:21.853
goes through despite
Caspere's tragedy.

17:22.221 --> 17:24.055
If you got this transaction
legally documented,

17:24.423 --> 17:26.290
- it shouldn't be hard.
- You know we have issues.

17:26.759 --> 17:28.827
If we had a fucking paper trail,
we'd be doing this through banks.

17:29.228 --> 17:31.429
Well, otherwise I'd say you're
in the unenviable position

17:31.730 --> 17:33.131
of being owed money
by a dead man.

17:33.432 --> 17:35.133
That's $5 million of my money.

17:35.467 --> 17:37.101
<i>Hold it, we were</i>
<i>given to understand</i>

17:37.436 --> 17:39.069
that our partnership
was with Catalast.

17:39.438 --> 17:41.172
Had Mr. Caspere made payment,
it would have been.

17:41.640 --> 17:44.208
And your name would have been added to the
corporate charter for the development.

17:44.543 --> 17:46.377
- But he didn't.
- How do I know that?

17:46.645 --> 17:48.279
We're not gangsters, Frank.

17:48.547 --> 17:50.348
<i>This is unacceptable.</i>

17:50.749 --> 17:52.950
Since Caspere's remaining
interests have been voided,

17:53.318 --> 17:55.286
I can provide you the
same parcel, same price.

17:55.553 --> 17:57.788
- Seven million.
- The same?

17:57.989 --> 17:59.023
We were quoted 10.

17:59.224 --> 18:00.324
Not by me.

18:05.063 --> 18:07.064
Motherfuck.

18:07.265 --> 18:08.933
Motherfuck me.

18:10.668 --> 18:14.170
We sold off our Vinci assets
to put in with Caspere and...

18:17.308 --> 18:18.342
I went liquid for this deal.

18:18.743 --> 18:20.577
What can I tell you, Frank?
It sounds like Mr. Caspere

18:20.911 --> 18:22.412
was playing fast and loose
with your capital.

18:22.680 --> 18:24.381
I can offer you
the buy-in again,

18:24.649 --> 18:26.182
but it sounds
like you're short.

18:26.416 --> 18:27.683
I can get it back.

18:28.018 --> 18:30.419
Find another stake,
it'd be worth your while.

18:30.620 --> 18:32.288
Excuse me.

18:37.828 --> 18:39.996
Shit.
Seven he says?

18:40.331 --> 18:42.098
Seven's the same
as 10 to me at this point.

18:42.333 --> 18:44.266
Can't round off zero.

18:55.044 --> 18:57.380
Am I diminished?

18:57.681 --> 18:59.514
Is that my message
to the goddamn--

19:03.519 --> 19:06.088
My business partner
takes my money,

19:06.356 --> 19:08.823
gets tortured and murdered,

19:09.025 --> 19:11.326
and what?

19:11.727 --> 19:14.396
I'm waiting on this Velcoro
burnout to make like Rockford?

19:17.299 --> 19:19.868
Get everybody.

19:20.202 --> 19:23.471
Stan, Ivar, his cousins,
our Glendale people.

19:23.839 --> 19:25.640
Fucking Blake, wherever
the fuck he's been.

19:26.008 --> 19:27.742
Frank, we can look
at your remaining assets.

19:28.043 --> 19:30.478
I don't have
any fucking assets.

19:30.846 --> 19:33.314
The house and the poker room
were double mortgaged.

19:36.351 --> 19:38.052
This was fucking everything.

19:38.387 --> 19:41.122
That's what you meant.
Frank, why did you--

19:41.390 --> 19:43.557
Leave it.
I'll get it back.

19:45.827 --> 19:47.395
Every dime.

19:49.263 --> 19:52.999
That was maybe a month ago.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.802
September.

19:55.202 --> 19:57.638
Celebrated breaking ground
on the Red Line extension

19:58.039 --> 20:02.476
and the imminent production
of a major Hollywood movie.

20:02.844 --> 20:06.146
Big news for the city.
And Ben had a hand--

20:06.580 --> 20:09.316
Could you tell us anything about
Mr. Caspere's demeanor at the party?

20:09.583 --> 20:12.385
Was he with someone?
A date?

20:15.622 --> 20:18.425
A woman he had been seeing.

20:20.127 --> 20:22.728
I think.

20:23.029 --> 20:25.331
Can't quite recall her name.

20:25.699 --> 20:30.035
- Ernst?
- A Miss Tascha, I believe, sir.

20:30.437 --> 20:32.972
He see a lot of girls? Enough
you wouldn't know her name?

20:33.306 --> 20:36.576
I believe Ben maintained
an active social life.

20:36.910 --> 20:40.712
<i>We didn't often</i>
<i>cross paths that way.</i>

20:40.981 --> 20:43.715
We only met over business.

20:44.117 --> 20:46.418
You wouldn't have any
pictures from the party, sir,

20:46.619 --> 20:48.620
by any chance?

20:48.955 --> 20:51.256
Something to help us
identify the girl.

20:56.228 --> 20:57.696
Mr. Caspere was dedicated
to his community.

20:57.964 --> 21:00.665
A community of 95 residents.

21:01.066 --> 21:04.068
He didn't seem distressed
by anything last you saw him?

21:04.336 --> 21:07.005
No, just the usual headaches.

21:08.574 --> 21:10.842
County can't forgive
our independence.

21:11.143 --> 21:13.144
And you didn't talk to him much

21:13.445 --> 21:14.778
outside of business
get-togethers?

21:15.080 --> 21:17.848
And cabinet meetings
occasionally.

21:18.017 --> 21:20.118
Well...

21:20.452 --> 21:22.086
thank you, Your Honor.
That'll do us.

21:22.587 --> 21:25.256
Do you recall what time Mr. Caspere
left your house night of the party?

21:25.590 --> 21:28.659
I believe around 11:00,
maybe 12:00.

21:29.093 --> 21:31.194
- Around the time things broke up.
- With Miss Tascha?

21:31.462 --> 21:33.363
Thank you, Your Honor.

21:33.632 --> 21:35.132
Thank you, Detective.

21:35.500 --> 21:38.301
I'd like to see this solved
as soon as possible.

21:44.375 --> 21:46.643
<i>Got his bank
records, phone calls.</i>

21:47.011 --> 21:48.412
<i>Don't know if he had</i>
<i>any of the lines, though.</i>

21:48.812 --> 21:50.447
Starting to think he must
have kept other accounts.

21:50.781 --> 21:53.950
Hey, kid, just save it
for the debrief.

21:54.185 --> 21:55.952
Why are you here?

21:56.287 --> 21:57.854
You're not even
an investigator, right?

21:59.557 --> 22:01.758
Special detail.
State owns the case.

22:02.192 --> 22:05.227
Found his lawyer, too. Had to
hump all over LA for this shit.

22:05.529 --> 22:08.297
Oh, and this one fag
at the bank

22:08.566 --> 22:10.700
tried, like, hitting on me.

22:10.968 --> 22:12.301
Almost clocked the guy.

22:12.570 --> 22:14.170
Yeah?
Why would you do that?

22:15.706 --> 22:16.973
Hey, no trouble here, stud.

22:17.307 --> 22:19.175
Just leave me
out of it, all right?

22:41.097 --> 22:42.497
His insurance had these forms.

22:42.832 --> 22:45.166
Items likely stolen
from Caspere's place,

22:45.434 --> 22:47.035
we can put out
pawn sheets on them.

22:48.905 --> 22:49.905
What'd you guys get?

22:50.272 --> 22:53.741
The young man here,
he got a dynamite anecdote.

22:56.579 --> 22:57.878
Last withdrawal
was five days ago.

22:58.180 --> 22:59.747
<i>Nothing jumps except this.</i>

23:00.082 --> 23:02.950
Once a month,
$4,000 cash withdrawal.

23:08.389 --> 23:10.591
Let me see this.

23:15.964 --> 23:17.732
The withdrawals seem
to come around the time

23:18.066 --> 23:19.600
of these blank days
in his calendar.

23:21.770 --> 23:23.604
- Did you get his GPS?
- Yeah.

23:26.207 --> 23:27.774
Here.

23:29.710 --> 23:31.178
There's nothing on those dates.

23:31.579 --> 23:34.348
Car didn't go anywhere. Says
his Mercedes was a lease.

23:34.749 --> 23:37.484
- Well, that makes sense.
- Not city. Catalast Group.

23:37.785 --> 23:38.952
Why'd Catalast lease him a car?

23:44.091 --> 23:45.825
Maybe somebody
should call them.

23:54.434 --> 23:55.969
You tight with him?

23:56.270 --> 23:57.703
I'm not tight with anybody.

24:01.575 --> 24:04.410
Can I pick up here tomorrow?

24:05.512 --> 24:06.779
Sure.

24:23.797 --> 24:25.630
I gotta go.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.841
- What?
- These coordinates.

24:37.042 --> 24:38.343
They're up north.

24:38.644 --> 24:41.346
Monterey County,
Fresno, Gilroy.

24:41.614 --> 24:43.348
A lot of them on weekends.

24:56.161 --> 24:58.429
Hey.

24:58.630 --> 24:59.997
Where's Chad?

25:03.801 --> 25:05.902
He's not coming.

25:06.070 --> 25:08.305
What? Why?

25:08.640 --> 25:11.041
You're gonna ask me why? Really?

25:11.243 --> 25:12.409
You fucking prick.

25:12.677 --> 25:14.010
What, that thing at the school?

25:14.379 --> 25:16.012
I apologized to Chad and
it's between me and him.

25:16.381 --> 25:18.048
That's not the end of the
story and you know it.

25:18.516 --> 25:20.516
- How's that? - The police said that
someone beat up Wit Conroy.

25:20.918 --> 25:23.720
Said it had something to do
with a schoolyard altercation.

25:24.055 --> 25:25.088
Well, I don't know
anything about that,

25:25.489 --> 25:27.824
but sometimes a good beating
provokes personal growth.

25:28.192 --> 25:30.060
It's not like you know
any other way, right?

25:30.261 --> 25:32.695
God damn it.

25:33.064 --> 25:35.898
Chad gets anxious when
he has to be around you.

25:36.199 --> 25:38.100
Do you get that?
Do you even see it?

25:38.369 --> 25:40.503
That's bullshit.
I-- we talk,

25:40.904 --> 25:43.506
we build models, we write
letters, I got him this recorder.

25:43.840 --> 25:44.840
And how many times
has he written you back?

25:45.208 --> 25:47.443
He needs me, all right,
even if he doesn't know it.

25:47.844 --> 25:49.712
And if he gets anxious, it's
probably because he knows

25:50.113 --> 25:51.614
he's gonna have to listen to his
mom talk shit about his dad.

25:51.882 --> 25:55.384
Yeah.
You're bad, Ray.

25:55.618 --> 25:56.952
You're a bad person.

25:57.287 --> 26:00.222
- And you're bad for my son.
- Don't say that.

26:00.423 --> 26:03.159
You know me.

26:03.393 --> 26:06.395
We had something and--

26:06.797 --> 26:08.664
What I done for you, things
started to slip away from me--

26:08.964 --> 26:10.098
No, you didn't
do that for me, Ray.

26:10.433 --> 26:12.701
Don't you dare say
that you did that for me.

26:13.035 --> 26:14.202
I had a right
by any natural law.

26:14.404 --> 26:15.970
I had a right.

26:23.045 --> 26:24.946
I came to tell you
this in person.

26:25.214 --> 26:27.015
Richard didn't want me to.

26:27.416 --> 26:29.083
I'm getting an emergency
writ for supervised visits.

26:29.285 --> 26:31.652
What? No.

26:31.954 --> 26:34.388
We're petitioning
for sole custody.

26:34.556 --> 26:36.424
What?

26:36.591 --> 26:37.692
No, why?

26:37.960 --> 26:40.161
Because this can't go on.

26:40.329 --> 26:42.530
It can't.

26:42.798 --> 26:44.932
I mean, look at yourself.

26:45.266 --> 26:47.635
You will not-- no.
Please, please, don't.

26:47.969 --> 26:50.571
You used to have
something, a decency.

26:50.839 --> 26:53.207
You were good at being decent

26:53.475 --> 26:55.576
until something happened.

26:55.977 --> 26:58.378
<i>You were fine as long</i>
<i>as everything else was fine.</i>

26:58.847 --> 27:01.748
But then something happened and you
weren't strong enough to stay decent.

27:02.116 --> 27:03.650
- And now--
- You won't get away with it.

27:04.085 --> 27:06.820
I will burn this entire fucking
city to the ground first.

27:09.290 --> 27:11.225
I'll petition for a
paternity test, too, Ray.

27:11.625 --> 27:14.294
- If you make me.
- Don't. Please. Please, don't.

27:14.528 --> 27:16.463
Don't do that, please.

27:16.797 --> 27:19.265
God damn it, look,
he's-- he's all I--

27:19.533 --> 27:21.000
all right, I'm a piece of shit,

27:21.369 --> 27:23.302
but that boy is all I have
in my entire shitty life.

27:23.504 --> 27:25.705
No, babe.

27:26.006 --> 27:28.441
Then don't you know
he deserves better?

28:08.915 --> 28:11.482
Oh, fuck.
Son of a bitch.

28:11.884 --> 28:14.286
Some asshole just rear-ended my car.
Look, you mother-- ah!

28:16.755 --> 28:18.589
Fuck.

28:18.857 --> 28:22.092
Son of--

28:22.260 --> 28:23.928
Oh, fuck.

28:26.364 --> 28:29.066
Next time, we put you in trunk.

28:37.542 --> 28:39.943
Oh, fuck!

28:40.244 --> 28:42.779
Jesus, buddy.
What was that about?

28:43.080 --> 28:45.381
Oh, God, thank you.
Fuckin' me--

28:47.251 --> 28:48.718
Why would somebody come
after you like that, guy?

28:49.019 --> 28:50.386
I mean, that was crazy, right?

28:50.688 --> 28:52.655
I don't know.
They just--

28:52.957 --> 28:54.257
What did you do
to piss somebody off?

28:54.624 --> 28:56.259
- Can you think of anything?
- What does that mean?

28:56.626 --> 28:58.027
I don't know what that means.
I'm asking you.

28:58.429 --> 29:00.896
What you might have did to get
guys like that after you.

29:01.131 --> 29:03.032
Wait, do I know you?

29:03.434 --> 29:05.368
I've never seen you before,
but I saw the whole thing.

29:05.735 --> 29:07.403
And I wish we could
figure out what you did.

29:07.871 --> 29:10.272
Like some kind of behavior that guys
like that would have issue with.

29:10.574 --> 29:12.508
Like mouthed off
or made a gesture

29:12.809 --> 29:14.710
or you run a book
in Vinci sweatshops.

29:14.978 --> 29:17.045
What?
Is that what this is?

29:17.447 --> 29:20.148
Is what what what is? Is
that what you think this is?

29:20.584 --> 29:23.786
It just seems to me like you
pissed off some serious people.

29:24.087 --> 29:27.222
Maybe you ought
to take more care.

29:27.457 --> 29:28.890
Just a thought, pal.

29:48.644 --> 29:51.513
Velcoro and Bezzerides to see Dr. Pitlor.
We called ahead.

30:16.370 --> 30:17.604
You do surgeries here?

30:17.805 --> 30:19.272
Only cosmetic.

30:19.674 --> 30:21.775
The clinic employs a small
group of medical professionals

30:22.043 --> 30:23.977
who cover a variety
of services.

30:27.114 --> 30:28.615
This is quite a shock.

30:30.217 --> 30:32.618
Anything he might have
told you that indicated

30:32.853 --> 30:35.221
trouble, enemies?

30:37.191 --> 30:41.194
The reputation of this clinic rests
on its discretion, Officers.

30:41.395 --> 30:43.696
Confidentiality.

30:43.964 --> 30:46.132
Your patient was murdered.

30:46.367 --> 30:48.000
He's got no living family.

30:53.406 --> 30:55.641
Somebody burned out
his eyes with acid, Doc.

31:04.350 --> 31:08.853
Well, of course
I am willing to help.

31:09.155 --> 31:10.755
I would hope I can, at least.

31:11.057 --> 31:12.624
What were you treating him for?

31:12.925 --> 31:16.061
A number of things.
Neuroses, anxiety,

31:16.329 --> 31:18.897
a painful past like many.

31:20.400 --> 31:21.432
Guilt.

31:21.667 --> 31:22.968
Guilt over what?

31:23.268 --> 31:25.637
Ben had a weakness
for young women.

31:25.938 --> 31:28.139
Paying for them,
more specifically.

31:28.507 --> 31:31.076
He frequented escorts,
although it ignited in him

31:31.376 --> 31:33.211
tremendous shame
and self-loathing,

31:33.545 --> 31:37.348
which resulted in further
damaging tendencies.

31:39.351 --> 31:41.352
- Old cycles.
- How long had he been seeing you?

31:42.921 --> 31:43.854
About three years.

31:44.256 --> 31:46.724
Was he making any
progress, his therapy?

31:46.958 --> 31:47.925
I like to think so.

31:48.227 --> 31:49.594
His relapses were less frequent

31:50.028 --> 31:52.096
and he didn't compound them
with further damaging behavior.

31:52.464 --> 31:54.999
His habit, did he ever
mention any girls by name?

31:55.299 --> 31:57.701
Favorite service?
Favorite girl?

31:58.136 --> 32:01.138
No, not that I recall, but I'd be
willing to go back over my notes.

32:01.472 --> 32:04.975
What about the name Tascha?
He ever mention her?

32:06.711 --> 32:09.479
Did he ever mention violence?
Trouble with a girl, a pimp?

32:09.881 --> 32:13.283
He was sexually obsessed,
but he was not aggressive.

32:13.484 --> 32:16.886
More... passive.

32:20.057 --> 32:23.593
That's about as detailed as I'll
get airing Ben's personal issues.

32:25.729 --> 32:27.997
This was helpful.
Thank you.

32:31.135 --> 32:34.403
Your ID said
Antigone Bezzerides.

32:34.805 --> 32:38.207
Are you related to Elliot
Bezzerides by any chance?

32:38.608 --> 32:40.877
- You know him?
- I used to a bit a long time ago.

32:41.244 --> 32:42.945
I did some social theory
with the Good People.

32:43.246 --> 32:45.347
He had a daughter, I remember.

32:46.650 --> 32:47.849
Good Lord, was that you?

32:48.117 --> 32:50.452
I left all that behind.

32:50.687 --> 32:52.421
It was a fucked-up place.

32:52.755 --> 32:55.224
Well, all kinds
of secrets in the world.

32:55.458 --> 32:57.092
All kinds of truth.

32:57.460 --> 32:59.961
Five kids living there
when I was growing up.

33:00.296 --> 33:02.230
Two are in jail now,
two committed suicide.

33:02.498 --> 33:03.899
How's that for social theory?

33:04.266 --> 33:07.169
- And the fifth?
- She became a detective.

33:26.888 --> 33:29.890
<i>To curb public
speculation in this homicide,</i>

33:30.292 --> 33:32.493
<i>it's become necessary</i>
<i>to announce that our offices</i>

33:32.961 --> 33:35.462
<i>are conducting a criminal probe
into the incorporated city</i>

33:35.697 --> 33:38.099
of Vinci in LA County.

33:38.533 --> 33:40.634
<i>This investigation is long overdue.</i>

33:40.869 --> 33:43.137
<i>And we ask all state</i>

33:43.471 --> 33:46.140
<i>and city officials</i>
<i>to cooperate...</i>

33:46.474 --> 33:48.843
Attorney general
just announced a shakedown.

33:53.514 --> 33:54.881
You're not supposed
to bring that here.

33:55.082 --> 33:57.718
It's short 10.

33:58.018 --> 34:00.420
When you took over
from Gene Slattery,

34:00.655 --> 34:02.055
we established terms.

34:02.357 --> 34:05.024
Short wasn't part of it, Frank.

34:05.326 --> 34:06.659
I'm pulling
some stuff together.

34:06.894 --> 34:08.261
Adding revenue streams.

34:08.527 --> 34:09.562
I just need a couple of weeks.

34:09.929 --> 34:12.165
I sold the rent farms
and waste disposal business

34:12.532 --> 34:14.134
to pull together the corridor money.
You know that.

34:14.434 --> 34:15.969
You still owe
the poker room kickback.

34:16.270 --> 34:18.071
Sell some of that land
if you need to.

34:18.405 --> 34:20.706
Caspere died with
my money in his pocket.

34:21.074 --> 34:25.244
I've had outside interest
re: the poker room.

34:25.545 --> 34:27.313
Think they can turn
a higher gross.

34:27.614 --> 34:30.149
- <i>Higher vig.</i>
<i>- What outside interest?</i>

34:30.449 --> 34:33.351
Just so you know,
it's a seller's market.

34:35.889 --> 34:38.724
You seriously gonna
bust my balls over 10 Gs?

34:39.092 --> 34:41.393
I kept this place tight
as a drum six years.

34:41.795 --> 34:44.830
<i>Who squashed the undocumented
workers alliance?</i>

34:45.063 --> 34:46.130
That hit and run?

34:46.431 --> 34:48.000
Your son's face
was so coke-dusted

34:48.234 --> 34:49.434
he looked like a clown.

34:49.702 --> 34:51.969
Tony, yeah.

34:54.306 --> 34:56.641
My son, I fear,

34:56.909 --> 34:59.611
is losing his fucking mind.

34:59.878 --> 35:02.514
Like his departed mother.

35:02.815 --> 35:06.518
Some people can't handle
the deep trip.

35:06.786 --> 35:08.787
<i>I fear he is a destroyer.</i>

35:09.254 --> 35:12.423
<i>In my day, you understand, it was
about consciousness expansion,</i>

35:12.657 --> 35:15.126
tracing the unseen web.

35:15.427 --> 35:18.429
Children are a disappointment.

35:18.663 --> 35:21.299
Remain unfettered, Frank.

35:23.168 --> 35:24.802
They closer on
who killed Caspere?

35:28.673 --> 35:31.408
Catalast is taking over
his action.

35:31.643 --> 35:33.677
Everything's happening.

35:34.111 --> 35:37.214
My farkakte offspring I will
set up with a club in Oakland.

35:37.515 --> 35:39.650
Let him be
a boy prince elsewhere.

35:39.984 --> 35:42.152
Whoever killed Caspere,
they have my money.

35:42.520 --> 35:44.621
- How's that?
- <i>The holding company is empty.</i>

35:45.089 --> 35:47.958
The land was never purchased and
I'm fucked out of my life's work.

35:48.292 --> 35:50.393
Now I need a direction
to turn, Austin.

35:50.694 --> 35:52.829
Or I may just start
pulling down walls.

35:55.299 --> 35:58.168
That doesn't sound like
a smart play, <i>gever.</i>

35:58.435 --> 36:00.603
Innuendo is nobody's friend.

36:01.105 --> 36:04.306
You're not worried whoever did Caspere
might be part of something bigger?

36:04.708 --> 36:07.076
Muscling in on the corridor,
secret handshakes and whatnot.

36:07.478 --> 36:10.613
Ben had his own charity
and what punched his ticket

36:10.947 --> 36:13.949
could have come from
some personal pocket.

36:16.219 --> 36:19.355
Nobody muscles me, Frank.

36:19.689 --> 36:22.091
<i>State attorney</i>
<i>will get his piece,</i>

36:22.458 --> 36:24.826
Caspere will get closed,
the world will turn

36:25.061 --> 36:27.062
uncaring of our struggles.

36:32.502 --> 36:36.304
They close Caspere,
I want a tip.

36:36.672 --> 36:38.473
I want time alone
with the guy that did it.

36:41.511 --> 36:43.978
You are industrious, Frank.

36:44.313 --> 36:46.548
I want to see you
make it through this.

36:48.250 --> 36:49.684
Who wants to move
on the poker room?

36:50.019 --> 36:52.320
Kickback's an extra
15 next week, Frank.

36:52.554 --> 36:54.355
22.50 the week after.

36:54.656 --> 36:56.490
You don't come through then,

36:56.825 --> 36:58.927
<i>I have to entertain</i>
<i>other interests.</i>

36:59.161 --> 37:00.929
It's business.

37:02.064 --> 37:03.431
Sure.

37:16.678 --> 37:19.146
Now this is making
some sense, right?

37:19.414 --> 37:20.848
It explains his home decor.

37:21.282 --> 37:24.151
Nine to one the cash withdrawal
every month was a hooker blowout.

37:24.518 --> 37:26.619
Guy's regularly in touch
with criminal elements.

37:28.957 --> 37:31.091
Pimps,

37:31.426 --> 37:32.725
they break in,
tortured him somewhere.

37:33.061 --> 37:34.428
Probably trying
to get access to assets.

37:34.728 --> 37:36.496
I think it's more
twisted than that.

37:36.864 --> 37:38.565
What was done to him,
that shit in his house.

37:38.933 --> 37:41.400
He's into a lot of stuff
we're just scratching.

37:41.802 --> 37:45.304
Well, we can have Woodrugh
work prosts, escort services.

37:45.573 --> 37:46.940
He'd be smooth for that.

37:49.209 --> 37:50.643
Sure.

37:54.548 --> 37:57.183
You know that expression
about flies and honey?

37:57.550 --> 38:00.119
Mmm. The fuck do I want
with a bunch of flies?

38:00.487 --> 38:02.154
Well, you don't have flies,
you can't fly-fish.

38:16.469 --> 38:18.303
What is this fucking place?

38:19.639 --> 38:21.707
Suburban flight,

38:22.074 --> 38:24.576
heavy manufacturing
moves inland or overseas,

38:24.777 --> 38:26.411
plants close.

38:26.746 --> 38:28.413
Except here, a bunch
of good capitalists

38:28.748 --> 38:30.348
ran in for cheap leases,
tax incentives,

38:30.682 --> 38:33.318
<i>immigrant labor,</i>
<i>sweatshop economics.</i>

38:33.619 --> 38:34.652
You don't have
a problem with that?

38:35.021 --> 38:38.755
No, my strong suspicion is
we get the world we deserve.

38:43.361 --> 38:45.662
Why are you here?
This place?

38:47.265 --> 38:50.434
I did time in the LA Sheriff's.

38:50.668 --> 38:52.869
I just needed better pay.

38:53.103 --> 38:55.906
Regular hours.

38:56.106 --> 38:58.474
I had a son.

39:03.380 --> 39:04.915
They told you
about me, I'm sure.

39:05.282 --> 39:07.551
Yeah, bosses said
you're a solid investigator.

39:07.952 --> 39:11.120
I know you wouldn't think it,
but I don't bullshit.

39:11.388 --> 39:12.621
What would you say if you did?

39:12.989 --> 39:14.424
Can I tell you what you
may or may not have heard,

39:14.824 --> 39:16.959
but almost definitely will
hear about my busted marriage?

39:17.361 --> 39:19.662
Rumors have me killing this
piece of filth hurt my wife.

39:19.996 --> 39:21.764
Same rumors put me in hock
to a Southland mob.

39:22.166 --> 39:23.466
And if you know who to ask,
you might hear I like to wet

39:23.800 --> 39:25.034
now and then from a
number of bad habits.

39:25.335 --> 39:26.969
- Any of that true?
- Oh, yeah.

39:27.236 --> 39:29.872
- Which parts?
- Bad habits.

39:32.141 --> 39:33.576
Never lost one yet.

39:35.344 --> 39:36.679
You?

39:37.047 --> 39:39.715
Oh, I don't distinguish
between good and bad habits.

39:41.150 --> 39:42.250
What's with all the knives?

39:42.651 --> 39:44.619
Could you do this job
if everyone you encountered

39:44.887 --> 39:47.355
could physically overpower you?

39:47.656 --> 39:48.890
I mean, forget police work.

39:49.258 --> 39:51.126
No man could walk around
like that without going nuts.

39:51.427 --> 39:53.528
So they're equalizers.
Makes sense.

39:53.896 --> 39:56.098
<i>No, I'd still wear them</i>
<i>if I wasn't on the job.</i>

39:56.399 --> 39:58.733
Fundamental difference
between the sexes

39:59.167 --> 40:02.403
is that one of them can kill the
other with their bare hands.

40:02.705 --> 40:04.872
Man of any size
lays hands on me,

40:05.207 --> 40:06.774
he's gonna bleed out
in under a minute.

40:08.844 --> 40:11.613
Well, just so you know,
I support feminism.

40:11.914 --> 40:14.548
Mostly by having
body image issues.

40:21.356 --> 40:23.857
What's that thing
Pitlor mentioned?

40:24.126 --> 40:25.826
Your dad, the Good People?

40:26.194 --> 40:29.896
It was this, like,
commune around Guerneville

40:30.132 --> 40:32.032
in the late '70s, '80s.

40:32.233 --> 40:34.501
Hippie shit.

40:34.802 --> 40:36.603
You had to look out
for yourself, huh?

40:45.146 --> 40:46.947
That's you.

41:03.597 --> 41:07.599
Look, I'm trying to effect
transparency between us.

41:07.834 --> 41:09.434
The reason being...

41:11.838 --> 41:13.372
I don't know if you know this,

41:13.640 --> 41:16.508
but us, the investigation,

41:16.810 --> 41:18.410
I don't think
it's supposed to work.

41:18.611 --> 41:20.412
Why is that?

41:20.747 --> 41:22.113
<i>State attorney's investigation.</i>

41:22.482 --> 41:25.350
They must have tapped you.
You know, the kid, too.

41:25.785 --> 41:27.786
Why wouldn't they have a team of
state grand jury investigators

41:28.154 --> 41:30.322
working Vinci instead
of just you and the kid?

41:30.690 --> 41:33.525
Why wouldn't the SA do a
full-court press on this?

41:36.962 --> 41:39.964
You want honest?

41:40.299 --> 41:42.667
Tell me, how
compromised are you?

41:52.845 --> 41:55.846
Anyways, good night.

42:30.648 --> 42:33.250
What is that?
Why didn't you tell me?

42:35.519 --> 42:37.721
- What the fuck?
- <i>Hmm?</i>

42:37.722 --> 42:38.722
_

42:41.359 --> 42:43.426
'Cause that right there is a
bunch of unbridled horseshit.

42:43.694 --> 42:46.129
<i>You read about the girl.</i>

42:46.396 --> 42:47.730
Goes to jail
for one more fuckup,

42:48.065 --> 42:51.067
tries to say I did something wrong.
That's it.

42:51.334 --> 42:52.701
Then why didn't you tell me?

42:53.036 --> 42:54.436
'Cause I don't want
to think about it.

42:54.738 --> 42:56.239
- Are you gonna lose your job?
- No.

42:56.606 --> 42:58.241
I got a new assignment
through the state attorney.

42:58.541 --> 43:00.309
I'm gonna be a detective after.

43:00.610 --> 43:02.578
Listen, this paper
talks about you

43:02.912 --> 43:04.380
being in this Black
Mountain Security thing.

43:04.748 --> 43:07.949
I told you, I don't
talk about the desert.

43:08.351 --> 43:10.786
But this Black Mountain Security,
they did things, bad--

43:22.265 --> 43:24.699
So that's it?
You're just taking off?

43:24.967 --> 43:26.902
Come on, I just told you.

43:27.236 --> 43:29.771
I got to go to LA
to work for a while.

43:30.106 --> 43:32.674
Special detail.
Special investigator.

43:33.042 --> 43:34.742
- That's it.
- God, you smell like a bar rag.

43:35.110 --> 43:37.645
They say vodka don't smell,
but that's bullshit.

43:37.946 --> 43:39.714
You smell just like my uncle.

43:40.048 --> 43:41.616
I'm just going
down south a while.

43:41.883 --> 43:44.319
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>
<i>- That's it.</i>

43:44.653 --> 43:46.887
- <i>And your apartment?</i>
<i>- Still there, Em.</i>

43:50.258 --> 43:52.392
What are you doing?

43:57.332 --> 44:00.434
I can't do this anymore.
I tried.

44:04.239 --> 44:06.307
It's work.

44:06.574 --> 44:08.542
It's a good thing, Em.

44:08.676 --> 44:11.345
No.

44:11.579 --> 44:13.747
You barely talk.

44:14.148 --> 44:16.115
I don't know your family.
You don't want to know mine.

44:16.417 --> 44:17.651
- Who are you?
- Oh, fuck off.

44:17.952 --> 44:19.353
Who the fuck
am I supposed to be?

44:19.754 --> 44:21.521
- I don't know who you're supposed to be.
- <i>Jesus Christ.</i>

44:21.756 --> 44:24.290
Yeah, fuck off.
Go.

44:24.658 --> 44:27.827
God, whatever happened
to you, I can't fix it.

44:29.429 --> 44:30.830
There's nothing wrong with me.

44:33.367 --> 44:35.434
I'll call you this weekend.

44:35.802 --> 44:38.537
Don't. I don't want to
hear from you, Paul.

44:38.839 --> 44:40.873
You can't give me
more than this.

44:41.140 --> 44:43.442
You're not--
you're not right.

44:43.810 --> 44:47.012
Sometimes I'm with you
and I can tell that...

44:49.850 --> 44:51.316
Fuck it.

44:51.518 --> 44:52.685
I gotta go.

44:52.886 --> 44:54.620
Don't come back.

44:54.855 --> 44:57.990
It's on you, not me.

44:59.325 --> 45:00.993
I can't see you again, Paul.

45:01.227 --> 45:03.028
You hurt me seeing you.

45:05.965 --> 45:08.133
You're doing this.

45:08.401 --> 45:10.969
This isn't me doing this.

45:11.170 --> 45:12.871
This isn't me.

46:17.435 --> 46:19.469
Surprised you're visiting
this pit you stuck me with.

46:19.736 --> 46:22.572
It's hard work up in here.

46:22.940 --> 46:25.875
I gotta say, being back
in here, I don't miss it.

46:26.209 --> 46:27.409
Seems like a headache
looking back.

46:27.711 --> 46:28.744
Fucking right it's a headache.

46:29.045 --> 46:32.348
Vendors, purchase
orders, licenses.

46:32.749 --> 46:35.050
Every one of these bitches
think this is "Pretty Woman."

46:38.321 --> 46:40.389
I need to know if any
of your girls knew a guy

46:40.623 --> 46:42.257
liked young trim.

46:42.558 --> 46:45.827
Maybe, like, a few months ago.

46:46.096 --> 46:49.064
He booked a date at his place.

46:50.100 --> 46:52.801
In Vinci?
The big house?

46:54.269 --> 46:57.238
No, this place small.
In Hollywood.

46:57.439 --> 46:58.607
Took-over home.

46:58.908 --> 46:59.808
You remember where it was?

47:00.075 --> 47:02.811
Go ahead, girl, speak.

47:05.815 --> 47:07.348
I write them down.

47:07.650 --> 47:10.451
Danny says you pay
attention to streets,

47:10.685 --> 47:11.986
always know where you are.

47:14.356 --> 47:17.625
This guy, he do anything scary?

47:17.959 --> 47:19.527
Anything might have
pissed somebody off?

47:19.761 --> 47:21.429
No.
He kind of...

47:21.630 --> 47:23.898
weak, you say?

47:24.133 --> 47:26.667
Just want to watch.

47:26.968 --> 47:28.468
Write it down
where you met him.

47:33.642 --> 47:36.577
I hope this goodwill does not go
unnoticed on your end, Frank.

47:36.845 --> 47:39.112
Everybody needs friends, see?

47:45.653 --> 47:47.921
<i>This is Hollywood
Division Vice Squad.</i>

47:48.389 --> 47:50.690
<i>Please leave your message after the
beep and we'll get back to you.</i>

47:51.059 --> 47:53.160
<i>This is Detective Bezzerides</i>

47:53.461 --> 47:56.296
with state police detail 93009.

47:56.730 --> 47:58.819
I was hoping to speak
with a vice detective--

47:59.633 --> 48:02.035
<i>If you are satisfied
with your message, press one.</i>

48:16.190 --> 48:21.737

49:10.101 --> 49:12.335
- Yeah. <i>- Yo, you remember</i>
<i>that missing girl?</i>

49:12.603 --> 49:13.870
I talked to her old roommate.

49:14.238 --> 49:16.172
Said Vera last called her
a couple months ago.

49:16.540 --> 49:18.074
Asked if anybody'd
come around looking for her.

49:18.575 --> 49:22.445
<i>I checked her phone records and a
call came from a Guerneville address.</i>

49:22.713 --> 49:23.813
How's it going down there?

49:24.115 --> 49:25.515
<i>It's a pain in the ass,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

49:25.750 --> 49:27.216
<i>Not much so far.</i>

49:27.584 --> 49:29.718
<i>It's-- might be a
hooker job, some pimp.</i>

49:30.053 --> 49:32.821
Let me let you go.
Catch up tomorrow?

49:32.989 --> 49:34.457
<i>Sure.</i>

49:34.625 --> 49:36.125

Place he brought girls.

51:04.746 --> 51:07.347
- You check it out?
- No, I don't want to go near it.

51:07.748 --> 51:10.483
And my people ain't exactly
proficient in evidence handling.

51:10.817 --> 51:12.218
<i>Figured you'd go in as police,</i>

51:12.653 --> 51:14.120

Grab anything that pushed towards
Caspere's dealing with land purchases.

51:17.524 --> 51:19.259
Yeah, what's going
on with that?

51:19.660 --> 51:22.027
Money. Place is about to
be worth a whole lot more.

51:22.328 --> 51:25.164
- This is Hollywood.
- So?

51:25.498 --> 51:29.001
Listen, I've been
wanting to ask you,

51:29.269 --> 51:30.702
things shake out like I expect,

51:31.071 --> 51:35.574
this time next year,
might be Chief of PD-- Vinci.

51:35.776 --> 51:37.476
How'd that be?

51:37.744 --> 51:40.078
Chief? I don't
want that, Frank.

51:40.513 --> 51:42.481
Did I ask you if you want that?
What's up with you, huh?

51:42.782 --> 51:44.716
I'm lining stuff up
for you here.

51:45.017 --> 51:46.652
That job pays 300K a year.

51:47.019 --> 51:49.788
You could hire a hell of a
family lawyer for that.

51:50.055 --> 51:53.525
That right there.

51:55.761 --> 52:00.564
You-- you remember
how we got together?

52:00.866 --> 52:02.133
I remember you dumping a body.

52:02.434 --> 52:06.171
The reasons for all
this, all that,

52:06.438 --> 52:08.606
might not exist for me anymore.

52:08.774 --> 52:11.375
You see?

52:11.643 --> 52:14.444
I got no reason
to keep at this.

52:14.779 --> 52:17.414
Meaning you'd consider
life in prison, what,

52:17.615 --> 52:18.748
a positive?

52:19.050 --> 52:20.483
No, I ain't saying that either.

52:20.885 --> 52:22.986
What, you have other options
here I'm not privy to?

52:23.288 --> 52:25.923
Everybody's got the one option,

52:26.157 --> 52:27.991
you want it bad enough.

52:29.493 --> 52:30.694
You used to be a hard man.

52:30.994 --> 52:33.262
- I'm tired.
- Then get some sleep.

52:33.564 --> 52:36.599
After you check the place out.

52:36.801 --> 52:38.768
Get back to me.

52:38.969 --> 52:40.637
And, Ray...

52:44.408 --> 52:46.342
I don't want to hear
you talk like that again.

53:00.123 --> 53:01.757
You want another beer, Ray?

53:02.024 --> 53:05.494
No, I-- I gotta
take off, I guess.

53:05.762 --> 53:08.230
He's keeping you busy.

53:08.431 --> 53:10.098
Yes, ma'am.

53:19.441 --> 53:21.209
You ought to take some time.

53:21.377 --> 53:23.278
A vacation.

53:23.612 --> 53:25.247
Have you ever been
to San Miguel de Allende?

53:25.514 --> 53:27.215
- No.
- That's where I'm from.

53:27.516 --> 53:32.020
Mountains, waterfalls,
this plaza.

53:32.321 --> 53:34.555
Well, that sounds really nice.

53:34.857 --> 53:37.525
Maybe I could show it
to you sometime.

53:37.893 --> 53:41.228
I think the only way I get
a vacation is if I croak.

53:41.530 --> 53:43.163
You should get
another job, then.

53:43.465 --> 53:45.366
It's too late
for that, darlin'.

53:47.503 --> 53:49.036
