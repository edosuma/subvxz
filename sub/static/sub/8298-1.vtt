00:27.607 --> 00:30.565
Growing up in the streets ain 't no joke.

00:31.367 --> 00:33.085
There's crazy crime...

00:34.047 --> 00:35.526
...drugs...

00:35.687 --> 00:37.598
...and mad violence.

00:37.767 --> 00:39.359
Yeah, the streets is tough.

00:39.527 --> 00:42.963
But there ain 't no streets tougher
than mine. The streets of...

00:44.327 --> 00:45.919
...Malibu.

00:47.647 --> 00:50.036
It's hardcore up in the 'Bu, y'all.

00:50.207 --> 00:52.323
It's just part of the everyday struggle.

00:52.487 --> 00:55.081
Things go down here
people should never see.

00:55.207 --> 00:57.357
We got bag ladies...

00:57.967 --> 01:00.037
...big ballers...

01:00.407 --> 01:02.602
...everybody strapped with a 9.

01:05.167 --> 01:07.840
This is my ghetto. The mall.

01:08.007 --> 01:11.044
Most of the time the police
won 't even come through.

01:11.207 --> 01:13.482
We got all sorts of sets up in here.

01:13.647 --> 01:15.797
We got the beach boys...

01:17.007 --> 01:20.886
...the ACCs:
the Abused Children of Celebrities...

01:21.047 --> 01:23.083
...and this is my crew.

01:24.007 --> 01:27.397
That's my boy Mocha.
That brother straight-up crazy.

01:27.567 --> 01:29.797
He did time in public school!

01:30.767 --> 01:34.680
That there is Hadji.
He's the Beast from the Middle East.

01:35.287 --> 01:38.438
And that's Monster.
She had a big chip on her shoulder...

01:38.607 --> 01:40.165
...till she ate it.

01:44.847 --> 01:47.998
Hey, that's me! B-Rad G.

01:48.487 --> 01:50.796
I run things around here.

01:50.967 --> 01:53.561
Now, sometimes bustas
be disrespecting.

01:53.687 --> 01:57.566
And you can 't punk out,
no matter what the devil may bring.

01:57.727 --> 02:01.959
Hey, yo, fool! We about to have some
hardcore drama go down right about now!

02:02.127 --> 02:03.276
That's right!

02:03.687 --> 02:07.362
This our mall.
Always has been, always will be.

02:07.847 --> 02:09.598
Mr. Amerislani.

02:09.767 --> 02:14.397
Our clerk accidentally gave you
the wrong aromatherapy candles.

02:14.967 --> 02:16.559
Here you go!

02:19.247 --> 02:22.159
- You validate parking?
- Of course, sir.

02:23.447 --> 02:26.723
That's what I'm talking about!
We get ours!

02:29.207 --> 02:30.640
That's my crib.

02:30.807 --> 02:33.765
It ain 't much, but it's all I got.

02:35.007 --> 02:36.406
If you elect me governor...

02:36.567 --> 02:38.717
That's my pops, Bill Gluckman.

02:39.447 --> 02:41.677
He getting his campaign on.

02:42.087 --> 02:45.159
I got mad love for the man,
but he's old-school.

02:45.327 --> 02:49.286
He needs to bring his word to the street.
That's where I come in.

02:49.447 --> 02:50.482
You see, friends...

02:51.287 --> 02:53.755
...California is my family.

02:57.447 --> 03:01.679
And speaking of family,
I want to introduce my wife, Bess.

03:02.647 --> 03:05.115
And my daughter, little Brenda.

03:06.007 --> 03:08.237
- Where's your son Brad?
- Yes, sir, where is he?

03:10.447 --> 03:14.326
Thank you for your questions.
Unfortunately, we are out of time today.

03:26.487 --> 03:30.082
Yo, what's up, y'all?
This is B-Rad G, kicking it from 'Bu.

03:30.727 --> 03:32.285
Represizzent!

03:33.087 --> 03:35.282
Hi, Pops, it's me! B-Rad!

03:35.607 --> 03:36.596
Hi, Brad.

03:36.767 --> 03:38.758
We all gathered here
On this special occasion

03:38.927 --> 03:41.236
To listen to my pops
He's your west-coast liaison

03:41.407 --> 03:43.682
A down-ass candidate
So easy to pick

03:43.847 --> 03:45.678
Hear his chat
Or I'm going to get sick

03:45.847 --> 03:47.997
It's the wild, wild west
Up here in these streets

03:48.167 --> 03:50.476
And I'm a cowboy pimp
When I get between the sheets

03:50.647 --> 03:52.877
I got the sallies with the
Biggest heinies in my stable

03:53.047 --> 03:55.277
I want to ride 'em, boy
But sometimes I'm not able

03:55.447 --> 03:57.642
I kiss them on the neck
I kiss them on the mouth

03:57.807 --> 04:00.162
I move downtown
Till I go...

04:00.327 --> 04:02.841
Show's over! That's it. Show's over!

04:05.247 --> 04:08.523
See that?
I know how to get the party started!

04:08.687 --> 04:10.882
And I know my pop was loving it.

04:11.047 --> 04:12.162
It's a disaster!

04:12.327 --> 04:15.319
The Times and the Chronicle
will run it as a big joke.

04:15.487 --> 04:17.921
- Thank God!
- How did this happen?

04:18.087 --> 04:20.805
I have no idea.
I didn't even know he was in town!

04:20.966 --> 04:24.642
We can't keep tabs on this kid?
Can anybody tell me where he is?

04:24.807 --> 04:26.399
That was off the hinges!

04:26.567 --> 04:29.559
I just got you another million votes
right there!

04:31.287 --> 04:33.118
What you doing here, son?

04:35.567 --> 04:38.479
I knew I had to show up
in order for you to blow up!

04:38.647 --> 04:41.719
So I called up Captain Tony,
he fired up the Lear jizzy...

04:41.887 --> 04:44.162
...and boo-yah! I'm in the hizzy.

04:44.327 --> 04:46.761
I'll be on the campaign trizzy too. 24/7.

04:46.927 --> 04:49.282
You know, kissing babies and whatnot.

04:49.447 --> 04:51.358
Pound it.

04:52.807 --> 04:55.526
Yeah, all good. Tom, you down,
you gots...

04:55.687 --> 04:58.838
Okay, dude.
I'll let you all do your campaign thing.

05:01.167 --> 05:02.725
Oh, Bill...

05:04.327 --> 05:05.965
You need to shut this down.

05:06.127 --> 05:09.563
Tell your son that he cannot be
in your campaign, period.

05:09.727 --> 05:13.845
Wait a minute. I love his enthusiasm.
It's a little misguided, but...

05:14.007 --> 05:17.522
Isn't there something he can do
for the campaign where he can't hurt us?

05:17.687 --> 05:19.006
No.

05:19.967 --> 05:21.878
- Phones?
- No.

05:22.887 --> 05:24.639
Stuffing envelopes? Making signs?

05:26.727 --> 05:27.842
Signs.

05:28.687 --> 05:30.757
In Bill Gluckman's administration...

05:30.927 --> 05:33.566
...women are going to have
better health care.

05:36.767 --> 05:39.520
Women are going to have better daycare!

05:41.367 --> 05:43.756
And women will have better jobs!

05:44.967 --> 05:49.279
In fact, after today,
my campaign has a new slogan:

06:00.927 --> 06:03.395
"Bill Gluckman is down with
the bitches and the ho's"?

06:03.567 --> 06:06.877
It was supposed to have read
"Women are first with Gluckman."

06:07.047 --> 06:09.686
No, no. That's old-school, Pops.

06:09.847 --> 06:12.441
You need to keep your pimp hand strong.

06:15.967 --> 06:17.400
So, Bradley...

06:17.567 --> 06:19.683
Yo, why you keep calling me that?

06:20.167 --> 06:22.476
Well, that's your name, isn't it?

06:22.647 --> 06:24.763
It's my slave name, all right?

06:25.607 --> 06:27.598
I told you like 50 times!

06:27.767 --> 06:29.086
Okay.

06:29.647 --> 06:31.365
B-Rad.

06:32.007 --> 06:33.486
What's up?

06:33.647 --> 06:36.764
What are your goals, B-Rad?
What do you want out of life?

06:36.927 --> 06:39.361
To be the biggest rapper there ever was.

06:39.647 --> 06:42.400
You see, doc, I got something to say...

06:42.567 --> 06:44.876
...and I need the world to hear it.

06:45.047 --> 06:47.038
I'm a "lyrisologist."

06:47.207 --> 06:48.640
I can rap about anything.

06:48.967 --> 06:50.798
Shrink-shrink
Blinkety-blink

06:50.967 --> 06:52.320
Tryin ' to make me think

06:52.487 --> 06:53.761
Want to go to my sink

06:53.927 --> 06:55.883
And vomit
Clean it up with Comet

06:57.607 --> 06:58.926
Earth is my plah-net

07:01.367 --> 07:04.757
See? I'm the shiznit! I'll buy y'all cars.

07:07.527 --> 07:08.801
I see.

07:09.407 --> 07:12.285
When did you first start feeling
like you were this...

07:13.287 --> 07:14.640
...shiznit?

07:14.807 --> 07:18.561
Dang, way back in the day.

07:18.727 --> 07:22.959
I had these beats in my head
since I was a little shorty.

07:38.087 --> 07:41.045
From then on in, it was hip-hop 24/7.

07:42.367 --> 07:45.757
As I was growing up, my parents
and me couldn 't communicate.

07:45.927 --> 07:47.883
They were always on different channels.

07:48.047 --> 07:51.005
Finish those vegetables, Bradley.
They smell good.

07:51.167 --> 07:52.964
You won 't be excused until you do.

07:53.767 --> 07:55.166
Forget y'all!

07:55.327 --> 07:56.680
That's it, mister...

08:02.207 --> 08:06.086
What I'm sensing, Brad...

08:06.247 --> 08:07.726
...is that...

08:08.527 --> 08:10.836
...your parents weren't always
there for you.

08:11.007 --> 08:12.998
- No.
- That's ridiculous.

08:13.167 --> 08:15.203
What about your bar mitzvah?

08:18.407 --> 08:23.117
What's the theme of your bar mitzvah?
Star Wars? Baseball? Superheroes?

08:23.287 --> 08:26.324
- It's O.P.P., bitch!
- What?

08:39.126 --> 08:40.480
Bess.

08:41.447 --> 08:43.244
I think you want to share.

08:44.246 --> 08:47.319
B-Rad, you're a wonderful son.
It's just that...

08:48.607 --> 08:49.926
Well...

08:52.287 --> 08:55.518
Bess, let's not beat around the bush.
Brad...

08:55.687 --> 08:59.362
...your behavior has become
an embarrassment to the family.

08:59.527 --> 09:00.880
Don't be hating.

09:01.047 --> 09:03.322
And I can't have you
on the campaign anymore.

09:04.727 --> 09:07.924
What? That's how it is?
You done it now!

09:08.087 --> 09:10.396
Y'all opened up big a can of tough love!

09:15.207 --> 09:18.199
- What can we do, doctor?
- I don't know.

09:19.927 --> 09:23.522
This is the most advanced case
of "gangsta-phrenia" I've ever seen.

09:23.847 --> 09:26.361
Three colors for our country.
Where's the red?

09:26.807 --> 09:28.763
Bill! Hey, Bill.

09:28.927 --> 09:30.997
- How'd it go with Dr. Feldman?
- Great.

09:31.167 --> 09:34.000
If he sees Brad five times a week
for the next three or four years...

09:34.167 --> 09:36.078
...we should see some real improvement.

09:36.247 --> 09:39.717
But, sir, the election is eight weeks away.

09:39.887 --> 09:41.479
- Right, good point.
- It's okay.

09:41.647 --> 09:44.241
We've been brainstorming
some different approaches...

09:44.407 --> 09:47.365
...and we might have something solid.
- Well, I'm all ears.

09:47.527 --> 09:50.280
- Go!
- Okay, sir.

09:50.447 --> 09:53.644
Brad acts ghetto, right?

09:53.807 --> 09:56.082
But he's never been east
of Beverly Hills.

09:56.247 --> 09:58.886
But what if we give him
a little dose of reality?

09:59.047 --> 10:01.242
Let him get a firsthand look
at the ghetto.

10:01.407 --> 10:03.875
- You mean have Brad actually go there?
- Exactly.

10:04.047 --> 10:07.357
- Well, now, that sounds dangerous.
- No! Perfectly safe.

10:08.167 --> 10:11.159
- How's it work?
- We hire actors to play gangstas.

10:11.327 --> 10:15.684
Right. They will carjack Brad
and take him on a tour around the 'hood.

10:15.847 --> 10:18.441
Give him a taste of what
the thug life is really like.

10:18.567 --> 10:21.559
- It might just scare the black out of him.
- Excuse me?

10:23.647 --> 10:26.036
Hey, don't you have something to do?

10:28.327 --> 10:29.646
Enough of the P.C.

10:29.807 --> 10:33.516
Fact is, unless we do something now,
Brad is going to cost us this election.

10:33.687 --> 10:35.120
Who would play the gangsters?

10:35.287 --> 10:37.596
Remember the anti-crime spot
we shot a month ago?

10:37.767 --> 10:41.157
- We've got that queued up.
- Yes, we do. Over here, please.

10:42.407 --> 10:46.878
For too long, street violence
has torn Californians apart.

10:47.047 --> 10:50.119
Bill Gluckman wants
to put our divisions behind us.

10:50.287 --> 10:52.881
Hey, instead of thinking
about what set you're from...

10:53.047 --> 10:55.686
...or what crew you're rolling with...

10:55.847 --> 10:57.883
...why don 't you both be brothers?

10:58.047 --> 10:59.036
What do you say?

10:59.207 --> 11:00.686
Your hair looks great.

11:02.127 --> 11:04.004
I ain't never thought of it like that.

11:04.167 --> 11:05.805
Shake hands.

11:09.007 --> 11:10.486
You see?

11:10.647 --> 11:13.115
California is my family.

11:20.407 --> 11:25.401
If we all work together as a family,
there's no telling how high we can go.

11:26.327 --> 11:29.922
See, that's beautiful.
These are the guys we're talking about.

11:30.647 --> 11:32.877
All right, let me get this straight.

11:33.047 --> 11:36.722
You want us to scare this kid
into acting like a little white boy again?

11:36.887 --> 11:38.798
If you don't think you can handle it...

11:38.967 --> 11:40.764
Of course we can handle it.

11:40.927 --> 11:44.602
- I'm from Juilliard, for chrissake.
- I'm from the Pasadena Playhouse.

11:45.687 --> 11:47.040
Good.

11:47.687 --> 11:50.042
I have some background information
on our dear boy Brad.

11:50.207 --> 11:51.196
Materials.

11:53.287 --> 11:55.323
Mali-bootay?

11:55.487 --> 11:57.921
Yes, he considers himself
a rapper of sorts.

11:59.527 --> 12:02.883
- Frigging A.
- The story is your basic kidnapping.

12:03.047 --> 12:05.322
By kidnapping, you mean
we hold him for ransom?

12:05.487 --> 12:07.125
Good question.

12:07.567 --> 12:08.556
Right.

12:09.527 --> 12:15.602
When you see him start to get ghetto
and do his whole black thing... Yes, that.

12:15.767 --> 12:17.246
I want it to piss you off.

12:17.407 --> 12:21.480
Tour him around the 'hood,
around the ghetto, if you will...

12:21.647 --> 12:25.083
...and show him what it's really like.
- In the ghetto?

12:25.247 --> 12:27.238
Pays 15 grand apiece, son.

12:27.527 --> 12:29.119
- We're in.
- Good.

12:29.287 --> 12:31.357
- Now, on the flip side...
- Flip it.

12:31.527 --> 12:36.043
If you two screw up and a single hair
is touched on Brad's overprivileged head...

12:36.207 --> 12:40.325
...I will see to it personally
that you two do some serious time.

12:40.487 --> 12:43.365
- Are we clear?
- Oh, we are Cristal.

12:44.767 --> 12:45.995
I like that.

12:51.487 --> 12:52.806
Mr. Gibbons.

12:53.567 --> 12:55.205
What about the money?

12:56.807 --> 12:58.718
We have 5 up front...

12:58.887 --> 13:01.685
...and 25 when you return him to us...

13:01.847 --> 13:02.882
...white.

13:03.607 --> 13:05.279
As the driven snow.

13:05.967 --> 13:09.642
- Pleasure doing business, gentlemen.
- Let me get that for you, sir.

13:10.127 --> 13:13.358
I'll call you. Or better yet, I'll holler.

13:13.847 --> 13:16.122
- We'll holler back!
- Holler back, player.

13:16.287 --> 13:18.482
Thank you. All right.

13:20.007 --> 13:22.601
Congratulations, buddy!
We just booked another gig!

13:22.727 --> 13:25.241
Not so fast, this is dangerous stuff.

13:25.407 --> 13:28.240
- This is the ghetto. We could get shot!
- Come on, man.

13:28.407 --> 13:31.205
We can handle ourselves. Right?

13:32.407 --> 13:36.286
This will be the ultimate acting challenge.

13:37.807 --> 13:40.162
- You know what really chaps my ass?
- What?

13:40.527 --> 13:43.678
After all of our years
of training and studying...

13:43.847 --> 13:46.566
...they continue to give us parts
that are gangbangers.

13:46.727 --> 13:51.357
Just once I'd like to play someone
who speaks with proper grammar...

13:51.527 --> 13:55.805
...and doesn't wear those Timberlands
with the laces undone, it's so sloppy.

13:55.967 --> 13:59.118
It beats getting dunked on
by Bill Gluckman!

13:59.287 --> 14:01.926
Do we even know anybody
that lives in the ghetto?

14:04.687 --> 14:06.279
My cousin.

14:06.727 --> 14:07.921
Shondra.

14:09.047 --> 14:13.279
That's the stupidest thing I ever heard.
I got better things to do with my time.

14:13.447 --> 14:16.598
Like what? Work at Wiener On A Bun?
Come on!

14:16.767 --> 14:20.157
Really, you're always talking about
improving yourself.

14:20.327 --> 14:23.205
- Here's your chance!
- I am improving myself, fool!

14:23.367 --> 14:26.803
I broke up with no-good, gangbanging
Tec, I'm going to beauty school...

14:26.967 --> 14:29.242
...and then I'm gonna hook up
my own salon.

14:29.407 --> 14:32.001
How about hooking a brother up
with a Pepsi and fries?

14:32.167 --> 14:33.566
Shut up, stupid.

14:33.727 --> 14:35.046
- PJ.
- What?

14:35.207 --> 14:36.276
You need to do this.

14:36.447 --> 14:38.915
You need to walk away
from this minimum-wage crap...

14:39.087 --> 14:41.920
...take these earnings
and start that beauty parlor.

14:43.767 --> 14:46.964
- What you paying?
- Business. We're in business.

14:47.967 --> 14:50.162
- A grand.
- We're paying a grand.

14:50.327 --> 14:53.524
- Make it trey and we on.
- Three thousand dollars?!

14:53.887 --> 14:55.923
Or you can kiss my ass.

14:56.967 --> 14:58.719
- Deal.
- Hey, hey.

14:58.887 --> 15:01.196
Deal. Now what about those fries?

15:11.527 --> 15:13.165
Thank you.

15:13.607 --> 15:15.757
- Hey, Gladys?
- Yeah, baby?

15:16.087 --> 15:19.045
You ever feel like you don't belong?

15:19.207 --> 15:20.526
All the time.

15:20.687 --> 15:24.600
Most folk only feel comfortable
around folk that's the same as them.

15:24.767 --> 15:26.837
They get around folk that's different...

15:27.007 --> 15:31.478
...get all scared and angry,
want to keep them down.

15:32.647 --> 15:34.683
What do you do about it?

15:34.847 --> 15:38.681
Nothing to do but keep it real
and be proud of who you are.

15:40.047 --> 15:41.719
Gladys?

15:42.847 --> 15:45.361
When they gonna leave our people alone?

15:45.527 --> 15:47.722
I don't know, baby.

15:48.407 --> 15:50.398
I just don't know.

15:51.207 --> 15:53.243
Now eat your greens before they get cold.

15:55.367 --> 15:58.916
"Whack: Weak, of poor quality.

15:59.087 --> 16:01.123
Bad. Whack."

16:02.447 --> 16:05.120
Your alma mater is whack.

16:07.007 --> 16:10.397
"Dis: To disrespect, to embarrass."

16:13.127 --> 16:15.960
- Bring it on, baby.
- We are strapped now, brother!

16:16.127 --> 16:18.038
Set these bad boys down.

16:18.487 --> 16:20.284
This is exactly what we ordered?

16:20.447 --> 16:24.235
Yeah, man. They got the Glocks,
the Tec-9s, the Uzis.

16:24.407 --> 16:26.921
- Freeze, sucker!
- That's convincing, brother!

16:27.087 --> 16:28.361
Look, they're fake.

16:28.807 --> 16:31.480
What the hell is that?
What's going on with your hair?

16:31.647 --> 16:33.478
Yeah, check it out, man, my hair.

16:33.647 --> 16:36.878
- Shondra just did it for me.
- Yeah, I see that.

16:37.047 --> 16:38.799
- You hate it.
- No, I don't hate it.

16:38.967 --> 16:42.357
I thought my character
was gonna have the cornrows.

16:42.527 --> 16:44.961
- That's all.
- Okay, I see what it is.

16:45.127 --> 16:48.358
You're just jealous
because you didn't think of it first.

16:48.527 --> 16:51.997
Frigging A, I'm not jealous, all right.
I'm an actor and I would've...

16:52.167 --> 16:54.237
You're frigging whack...

16:54.407 --> 16:55.840
...and don't dis me!

16:59.367 --> 17:02.439
- Got the gangster gear, my dog.
- Okay, cool.

17:10.646 --> 17:12.683
- What is so funny?
- The wig!

17:15.406 --> 17:17.557
I didn't know it was Halloween!

17:17.727 --> 17:21.117
While you're out,
could you bring me back some candy?

17:23.727 --> 17:24.762
Whatever, dude!

17:24.926 --> 17:27.680
Give me your ride, punk,
or I will dust your ass.

17:28.687 --> 17:31.884
- Nope. Not convincing.
- Damn it!

17:32.047 --> 17:34.003
Find your core character, Sean.

17:34.167 --> 17:36.635
You are an oppressed black man...

17:36.807 --> 17:39.605
...from the ghetto.
- I'm having trouble finding this one.

17:40.967 --> 17:43.561
- Think Tupac.
- All right. Let me try it again.

17:43.727 --> 17:45.399
I see it. Action!

17:45.567 --> 17:48.081
Give me your ride, punk,
or I will dust your ass!

17:48.247 --> 17:50.556
Add a "bitch" and I think you got it!

17:50.727 --> 17:53.844
Give me your ride, punk, or
I will dust your ass, bitch!

17:54.007 --> 17:56.077
- Bitch! Click it!
- Bitch!

17:56.247 --> 17:58.715
- Turn around and do it again!
- Bitch!

18:21.407 --> 18:23.841
Hey, yo, my name is B-Rad
Not Robbie Van Winkle

18:24.007 --> 18:25.440

18:25.607 --> 18:28.565

18:28.727 --> 18:31.195

18:31.367 --> 18:34.120
I'll take my money and I'm gonna...

18:34.567 --> 18:36.956
Yo, fool! What, nucka, what?

18:38.567 --> 18:39.602

19:24.887 --> 19:27.162

19:46.527 --> 19:49.041
I ain't seen you around here before.

19:49.207 --> 19:51.118
Where you reside?

19:51.287 --> 19:53.437

19:53.607 --> 19:55.643

19:56.207 --> 19:57.925

19:58.087 --> 20:02.638
Right. I guess it's pretty hardcore
up in here.

20:03.727 --> 20:05.683
Represent!

20:07.527 --> 20:10.121
Was that you dropping rhymes

20:10.247 --> 20:13.603
You heard me?
Hell, yeah. I'm a rhymer on time.

20:13.767 --> 20:15.439

20:23.207 --> 20:25.437

20:25.607 --> 20:28.883
I sent it to Dre,
but he ain't got back to me yet.

20:29.567 --> 20:33.765
That sound like Dre-Dre.
I'll holla at him about it, all right, boo?

20:34.647 --> 20:36.000

20:55.287 --> 20:58.404
You do got it going on

20:58.567 --> 21:01.161
I was on my way to go see him.
You wanna roll with me?

21:01.327 --> 21:04.399

21:04.567 --> 21:06.842

22:38.367 --> 22:39.686

You know what I'm about to do now?

25:26.727 --> 25:29.036
- I'm about to call your daddy.
- Call your daddy.

25:29.207 --> 25:34.520
You better hope your daddy home too.
If he ain't, you gonna be one dusted trick!

25:34.687 --> 25:37.406
Now get your ass on the bed, whitey!

25:43.047 --> 25:45.436
- Did you buy my rage?
- No. You're indicating.

25:45.607 --> 25:47.677
- Indicating?
- Yes, indicating.

25:47.847 --> 25:50.964
Excuse me?
I have never indicated in my life.

25:51.127 --> 25:53.482
Would you two fools just shut the hell up?

25:53.647 --> 25:55.239
She's right. Shut up.

25:55.927 --> 25:58.157
Thank you, Shondra. Whatever!

25:58.607 --> 26:00.643
All right, put this down. You're on.

26:00.807 --> 26:03.446
- Go, girlfriend. Do your thing.
- Give me this.

26:04.887 --> 26:06.639
Hey, Shondra.

26:06.807 --> 26:08.399
If you have to...

26:09.447 --> 26:11.324
...show a little ass.

26:11.487 --> 26:12.761
Shut up.

26:18.927 --> 26:21.122
- You all right in here?
- Oh, yeah.

26:21.287 --> 26:26.236
I just been kidnapped, carjacked
and hands tied behind my back.

26:26.407 --> 26:28.637
But other than that, it's all good.

26:29.447 --> 26:32.803
Look, I'm sorry about all that.
That wasn't really my idea.

26:36.487 --> 26:38.284
I thought you liked me.

26:39.447 --> 26:42.962
- I do!
- Then how come you set me up?

26:44.367 --> 26:48.246
I had to. They threatened to kill me
if I didn't play along.

26:49.167 --> 26:50.839
- For real?
- Yeah.

26:51.007 --> 26:54.397
- They straight-up killers out there!
- For real?

26:55.127 --> 26:58.085
Let me school you on something.
Help us both stay alive.

26:58.247 --> 27:00.841
- Okay.
- The one thing they hate...

27:00.967 --> 27:04.357
...more than anything
that really makes them crazy...

27:05.087 --> 27:08.238
...is posers.
- Me too, girl. I feel you.

27:08.967 --> 27:12.323
- I'm talking about you.
- Me? I ain't a poser. Shoot.

27:12.487 --> 27:16.480
- I got a Ph.D., a Poser-Hater Degree.
- Come on, quit fronting.

27:16.647 --> 27:17.921
I ain't fronting.

27:18.087 --> 27:22.239
- This is my sizzal. For rizzal, my nizzal.
- Stop it!

27:22.407 --> 27:25.444
You stop it right now
and you listen to me.

27:25.607 --> 27:28.565
If you just be yourself,
a nice little white boy...

27:28.727 --> 27:32.163
...I can convince them to let you go.
- But I'm being myself!

27:32.327 --> 27:34.602
I ams who I says I ams.

27:34.767 --> 27:38.203
Damn! Why won't anybody believe me?

27:42.767 --> 27:45.281
- Well?
- Maybe you should show him your ass.

27:50.247 --> 27:53.364
I thought that would have worked.
Weird.

27:53.927 --> 27:56.361
All right, what's next?

27:56.527 --> 27:58.404
- How about number three?
- Perfect.

27:58.567 --> 28:01.081
We're gonna take it
to an entirely different level.

28:01.247 --> 28:02.521
- I got it.
- What?

28:02.687 --> 28:07.044
I'm gonna walk in there and be crazy.
I'll be ghettofied, buckwild.

28:07.207 --> 28:10.563
You tell me, "Stick to the plan, man.
Stick to the plan. " Got it?

28:11.207 --> 28:14.085
- Wake up, snowflake!
- Yeah!

28:14.247 --> 28:16.397
- We called your dad!
- What did he say?

28:16.567 --> 28:19.001
He said he'd think about it.

28:19.167 --> 28:21.283
He don't want your ass home right now.

28:21.447 --> 28:25.486
- I can't say that I blame him.
- Hell, no. Not the knife, dog!

28:26.207 --> 28:27.196
Now come on!

28:27.367 --> 28:29.756
- What you doing?
- Teach this white girl a lesson!

28:29.927 --> 28:32.316
Bloodbath, we said
we would stick to the plan!

28:32.487 --> 28:36.162
- Bloodbath, stick with the plan.
- Tree, the plan done changed!

28:36.327 --> 28:37.760
Wannabe say he down.

28:37.927 --> 28:40.999
I'm gonna show him just how
un-down he is!

28:41.167 --> 28:43.203
- I gotta cut him!
- No, you can't cut him!

28:43.367 --> 28:44.800
- I gotta.
- You don't gotta.

28:44.967 --> 28:46.195
We can't get our money!

28:46.367 --> 28:48.323
- I thought you said to cut him!
- No...

28:48.487 --> 28:50.876
- Okay, just the white meat.
- Move! Let me cut him!

28:51.047 --> 28:52.639
Don't kill him though, Bloodbath!

29:10.247 --> 29:12.363
All right, now, Malibu.

29:12.527 --> 29:17.317
I want you to go up in there.
You go get me six 40s of O.E.

29:17.487 --> 29:19.637
- And a fifth of Henny.
- Yeah.

29:19.807 --> 29:22.401
- Anything else, dog?
- No, playa, I'm cool.

29:22.567 --> 29:23.795
Right on. Right on.

29:23.967 --> 29:25.559
I'd like some Pringles.

29:26.087 --> 29:28.601
This ain't no picnic, bitch!

29:28.767 --> 29:32.965
I'm sorry. Y'all got some ducats?
Because since you stole my...

29:33.127 --> 29:34.116
Man!

29:34.407 --> 29:38.036
You about to go up in there
and give them Koreans your ends?

29:38.207 --> 29:40.801
- Hell, no!
- You jack that shit, fool!

29:40.967 --> 29:45.245
And if the Asiatic give you any static,
hit the fool with this right here.

29:45.407 --> 29:47.363
- Look at the little busta.
- Little busta.

29:47.527 --> 29:49.245
- Can't even swing a gat.
- Shoot.

29:49.407 --> 29:51.841
- Talking about "he down."
- But...

29:52.007 --> 29:54.441
- You use that or I'm gonna use it on you!
- Okay.

29:54.607 --> 29:56.325
And if you try to get away?

29:56.487 --> 29:59.638
I'm gonna let you taste a piece
of my blue steel. You feel me?

29:59.807 --> 30:00.922
Okay. All right.

30:01.087 --> 30:02.805
- Go on, get out!
- Okay.

30:03.207 --> 30:04.640
Go!

30:11.767 --> 30:13.439
Hey, white boy.

30:20.327 --> 30:24.923
- "This ain't no picnic, bitch"? Wow!
- Thank you. I loved the blue steel line.

30:25.087 --> 30:26.076
Convincing.

30:38.527 --> 30:41.758
- I really can't believe that!
- Those improv classes are paying off.

30:41.927 --> 30:46.682
When you said, "This is no picnic, bitch,"
I screamed on the inside like one.

30:46.847 --> 30:48.166
- For real?
- Yeah, I said:

30:55.687 --> 30:57.757
I'm thirsty, I gotta tell you.

30:57.927 --> 31:01.966
And, boy, do I love Olde English.
It really helps quench my thirst.

31:20.607 --> 31:22.404
Can I help you?

31:29.807 --> 31:34.676
No, I'm gonna help myself to this O.E.
and anything else I want up in here, bitch!

31:45.767 --> 31:47.598
Can I help you?

31:53.607 --> 31:57.600
- Y'all never been robbed?
- Sure. Last week was 54 time.

31:57.767 --> 32:00.440
But they were cool.
No gun to head, never scream.

32:00.607 --> 32:03.360
- You know, good people.
- Cool.

32:03.607 --> 32:07.919
So, dude,
how much did you pay the guy?

32:08.087 --> 32:09.520
What are you talking about?

32:09.687 --> 32:13.123
- When you set this thing up yesterday.
- I thought you set it up.

32:14.527 --> 32:15.846
You mean...?

32:16.647 --> 32:18.842
Dude, the owner doesn't know
this is fake?

32:21.127 --> 32:23.436
$ 16.47.

32:27.207 --> 32:31.405
- Go in and save him! He could get shot!
- I'm not going in there! You go in there!

32:31.567 --> 32:32.886
His frigging life
is at stake!

32:40.327 --> 32:41.919
My emergency stash!

32:42.407 --> 32:45.604
I'm glad you got cash, because
if you had tried to jack me, fool...

32:45.767 --> 32:48.645
...I was gonna have
to lay you out with this!

32:48.807 --> 32:50.718
And with this.

32:51.807 --> 32:53.763
And with that.

32:57.287 --> 32:59.198
Keep the change.

32:59.367 --> 33:02.245
- Do me this one favor.
- You are the driver. I am the shooter!

33:02.407 --> 33:04.159
- I'm scared of Koreans!
- You...

33:04.327 --> 33:06.682
Thank you. Thank you very much!
Come again!

33:07.847 --> 33:10.441
What I'm about to do right now,
I know it sounds whack...

33:10.607 --> 33:13.963
...but it's just a joke, okay?
So please don't shoot me?

33:16.247 --> 33:20.399
Yeah, that's right, fool! Next time
I'll bust a cap in your punk ass, bitch!

33:20.687 --> 33:24.157
Yeah, you lucky I don't burn you down!
Hell, yeah! Hell, yeah!

33:24.327 --> 33:27.000
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- You actually did it?

33:27.167 --> 33:31.285
Let's roll! Hell, yeah! He didn't do
nothing! He straight-up trick.

33:31.447 --> 33:36.043
What's up with this? If you jacked it,
how come you got a receipt?

33:37.807 --> 33:39.081
I stole that too.

33:41.087 --> 33:43.396
What's on tap for tomorrow?

33:43.567 --> 33:48.163
We have the 11:00 with Greenpeace,
then drinks with the offshore oil lobby.

33:48.487 --> 33:53.436
- How's the Brad project going?
- Smooth. He's in South Central.

33:54.407 --> 33:59.037
- God, is he okay?
- Oh, he's in excellent hands.

33:59.687 --> 34:02.485
All right. I'm sick of playing
game with you, snowflake!

34:02.647 --> 34:07.118
I'm gonna give you five seconds to be real
or I'm gonna beat that ass to the curb!

34:07.287 --> 34:10.404
- What you mean be real?
- You know what I mean. Be white!

34:10.567 --> 34:11.920
- Five.
- Don't do it, Bloodbath!

34:12.087 --> 34:13.600
- Four.
- Don't do it, Bloodbath!

34:13.766 --> 34:14.916
- Three.
- He gonna do it!

34:15.087 --> 34:16.645
- Two.
- Kill him! Kill him!

34:16.806 --> 34:18.603
Okay, all right!

34:19.407 --> 34:22.319
Okay, fellas, look,
I'm really sorry, okay?

34:22.487 --> 34:26.799
I don't mean to offend you, you know.
I don't mean to front or act like a thug.

34:26.967 --> 34:28.366
I'm sorry.

34:36.487 --> 34:38.876
- You buying that?
- I don't know. I can't tell.

34:39.927 --> 34:40.916
Me neither.

34:42.007 --> 34:43.645
Let's give him the test.

34:46.726 --> 34:49.719
How you doing, white boy?
You cool?

34:49.887 --> 34:52.117
Great. Fine.

34:52.286 --> 34:54.197
Terrific popcorn.

35:11.207 --> 35:16.361
Run, bitch, run!
He gonna kill you!

35:20.887 --> 35:22.559
I ain't lying. I ain't lying.

35:22.727 --> 35:26.037
Sorry, y'all, but this is who I am.
I'm just a rapper, straight up.

35:26.687 --> 35:30.396
- Wigga, please!
- No, for real. I can rap about anything.

35:30.567 --> 35:32.205
You think you got skills?

35:32.647 --> 35:35.115
- We gonna see about that.
- Oh, hell, yeah.

35:35.287 --> 35:37.596
Bloodbath and Tree
They be beatin ' on me

35:37.767 --> 35:40.645
But if they listen to my song
Then we'd all get along

35:40.807 --> 35:43.526
I may be Jewish
But I got a nice schlong

35:44.367 --> 35:46.358
Hey, man.
I had it up to here with you.

35:46.527 --> 35:49.200
You better check yourself
before you wreck yourself.

35:49.367 --> 35:51.483
- This ain't Malibu.
- Represent.

35:51.647 --> 35:55.083
Oh, yeah. We gonna see what you
represent now, fool. We at the club!

35:55.847 --> 35:59.123
Snoop, Dre, Cube, all them.
They came in through here.

35:59.287 --> 36:01.881
Got something to prove
to yourself? Do it in there.

36:02.567 --> 36:04.637
Get in there, fool!
Go on up in there!

36:06.927 --> 36:10.681
- Think this is gonna do it, dude.
- Oh, we're about to get paid!

36:33.247 --> 36:34.999
What's cracking?

36:35.927 --> 36:37.645
Hey, dog.

36:38.367 --> 36:43.043
- Yeah, how you feeling now, Malibu?
- Like I'm home.

36:43.207 --> 36:46.643
Get your ass in there then, fool.
Go!

36:55.967 --> 36:58.561
Come on.
Let me get through here, man.

36:59.927 --> 37:01.918
- Yo.
- Man, I told you I didn't have...

37:03.767 --> 37:04.756
What's happening?

37:05.007 --> 37:07.805
Look, our homey...
You wanna get a young Dre next, man?

37:07.967 --> 37:10.162
Hell, no.
You hear what he's saying?

37:10.327 --> 37:13.080
Meet my boy, Ben Franklin.

37:14.527 --> 37:17.803
- What's his name?
- B-Rad from Malibu, player.

37:17.967 --> 37:20.083
B-Rad from Mal...?
You trying to get me shot?

37:20.327 --> 37:23.478
Hey, you met Ben Franklin's
twin brother?

37:26.847 --> 37:28.565
Cutter, playa.

37:28.727 --> 37:33.437
We're gonna bring him up. Go play with
each other. Come back in five minutes.

37:33.927 --> 37:37.363
- Playa...

37:37.527 --> 37:38.676
Get jiggy with it!

37:42.167 --> 37:44.078
Hey, miss. Where you been?

37:46.407 --> 37:47.840
Oh, Shondra!

37:49.127 --> 37:51.357
- I been busy, Tec.
- You been getting busy?

37:52.647 --> 37:53.921
None of your damn business.

37:54.127 --> 37:57.437
Okay, okay, I'm cool. I understand.
Just tell me who it is.

37:57.767 --> 38:00.565
All you need to know
is that it ain't your black ass.

38:00.807 --> 38:03.241
See, this that shit.
Think you're better than me.

38:03.527 --> 38:06.519
All you is is a chickenhead
and that's all you ever gonna be.

38:07.647 --> 38:10.081
Hey, girl. What's up?

38:10.247 --> 38:13.523
- You all right?
- I'm fine, but you the finest!

38:13.687 --> 38:17.123
She the truth too, dude. I'm telling you,
once Mothra gets set up, boy...

38:17.607 --> 38:20.883
- You hitting this?
- No. Now let me go!

38:21.047 --> 38:25.882
Hey, dude, didn't your mama ever tell you
how to treat a lady? That's not nice.

38:26.047 --> 38:27.241
Oh, so you know my moms?

38:27.407 --> 38:30.604
No, but she wouldn't appreciate you
grabbing a woman like that.

38:30.767 --> 38:32.041
What would your mom prefer?

38:32.207 --> 38:34.562
You know, just talk to them
and be nice to them.

38:34.727 --> 38:36.240
Know what my mom would do?

38:36.407 --> 38:39.126
My mom would tell you to
mind your own damn business!

38:39.287 --> 38:40.481
Don't!

38:40.647 --> 38:43.320
- Don't be hating.
- Tec, don't! Stop it!

38:48.887 --> 38:51.685
Y'all gonna be real sorry,
the both of you.

38:55.167 --> 38:58.000
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

38:58.167 --> 39:01.477
- Who was that?
- Old history.

39:02.527 --> 39:04.279
You know what?
Come on.

39:04.647 --> 39:05.716
He strong.

39:10.607 --> 39:12.643
- Excuse me.
- Where we going?

39:12.807 --> 39:15.640
Just shut up.
Move, please?

39:15.807 --> 39:17.365
You gotta get out of here.

39:17.527 --> 39:20.485
- You letting me go?
- I'm not having your blood on my hands.

39:20.647 --> 39:22.638
It's the red Honda by the door.
Just go.

39:22.807 --> 39:26.243
All the way from Malibu, B-Rad.
Give it up for B-Rad.

39:26.407 --> 39:29.046
Straight out of Malibu.
B-Rad, come on up. B-Rad.

39:29.207 --> 39:32.119
- Go!
- I can't.

39:32.287 --> 39:33.925
- Why?
- Shondra...

39:34.087 --> 39:36.920
...anybody can rap
at the Malibu County Fair.

39:37.087 --> 39:41.126
This is my chance, my one shot.
I gotta prove myself.

39:47.207 --> 39:49.721
This is gonna be
like an episode of Oz.

39:50.767 --> 39:52.644
Yeah, excuse me.

39:52.807 --> 39:56.482
Yeah, I'm just gonna go on stage,
do my rhyme thing.

39:58.607 --> 40:01.280
They kind of pack them
in tight here.

40:01.447 --> 40:04.484
- Get up there. Do your thing.
- Yeah, get up there, fool!

40:04.647 --> 40:06.160
Oh, hell, no!
No, hell, no.

40:06.887 --> 40:09.276
Him? No! Hell, no.

40:10.087 --> 40:13.079
- Do you all have a locker?
- Man, come on. You a rapper?

40:13.247 --> 40:14.236
Yeah, straight up.

40:14.607 --> 40:16.837
I didn't know Dairy Queen
had a rap label.

40:17.007 --> 40:20.079

So your mama got drunk
And fell asleep in the zoo

41:21.847 --> 41:23.883
With a zebra and a monkey
And came up with you

41:24.047 --> 41:26.641
When the doctor said push
She released her pelvis

41:26.807 --> 41:29.162
Oh, shit, now I'm battling
The hip-hop Elvis

41:29.327 --> 41:31.921

Hey, yo, I may be white
But inside, my soul is black as night

42:29.127 --> 42:30.879
And I don 't wanna fight
A 'ight

42:31.047 --> 42:32.526
I'd rather go fly a kite

42:32.807 --> 42:34.399
Or go on a low-carb diet

42:34.567 --> 42:36.159
That means no more pasta

42:36.447 --> 42:39.996
Y'all rappers is too slow
And I'm kinda faster

42:40.167 --> 42:42.397

Hardcore nigga

43:26.687 --> 43:30.236
It's Black History Month.
You out your rabbit-ass mind?

43:30.847 --> 43:34.362
What is this?
Is this some sort of rap initiation?

43:34.527 --> 43:36.563
This is not how they
do it on American Idol.

43:45.607 --> 43:47.006
Come on.

43:50.607 --> 43:52.325
Don't be hating.

43:55.527 --> 43:59.202
Yo, all y'all rappers out there!

43:59.367 --> 44:02.086

44:02.247 --> 44:04.920
Look, y'all. Y'all had

44:05.087 --> 44:07.555
Yeah, because B-Rad G's

44:07.727 --> 44:12.278
Yo, I ain't laughed that hard
in a long, long time. For real.

44:12.807 --> 44:16.163
Hey, yo, player. Your pops called,
and you know what he said?

44:16.327 --> 44:17.316
He ain't paying.

44:17.487 --> 44:20.206
He just wants you to stay
in the 'hood with the brothers.

44:20.367 --> 44:22.881
You know, since you so
down and all.

44:23.047 --> 44:25.277
I guess we gonna have
to smoke your punk ass.

44:25.447 --> 44:27.483
What you think about that?

44:29.047 --> 44:31.197
I don't care no more.

44:31.567 --> 44:33.922
I got nothing to live for.

44:34.647 --> 44:36.763
Go ahead, smoke me.

44:42.927 --> 44:44.076
Dude.

44:44.247 --> 44:46.238
You believe what they

44:46.407 --> 44:49.365
That's right. You getting played, homey.
Straight out, dog.

44:49.687 --> 44:52.485
- Excuse me?
- I said you getting played, dog.

44:52.967 --> 44:57.040
Little white boy up there hitting your lady.
She digging it, loving what's going on.

44:57.207 --> 45:00.802
You know what I was kind of thinking
to myself? Maybe I'd go next.

45:00.967 --> 45:03.686
- You want next?
- Let a homeboy get some action.

45:07.527 --> 45:09.358
Hey, homes! What's up?

45:09.527 --> 45:11.518
- Not here, Tec.
- What you wanna do?

45:11.687 --> 45:14.281
I wanna bag me a white boy,
that's what I wanna do.

45:22.207 --> 45:24.801
Hey, you okay?

45:27.687 --> 45:29.678
You know,
it's not as bad as it seems.

45:29.967 --> 45:34.165
It's worse. Everybody's right.
My rhymes is weak.

45:34.327 --> 45:35.999
You just need a little work.

45:36.207 --> 45:39.165
I should've run when you
gave me the chance.

45:39.327 --> 45:44.162
No, you were right. I respect you
for getting up there. You got mad heart.

45:44.327 --> 45:48.400
But you heard them laughing.
I ain't nothing but a busta.

45:48.567 --> 45:50.876
They just don't understand you.

45:51.047 --> 45:55.359
None of them know how
hardcore it is up in Malibu.

45:56.287 --> 45:58.721
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

45:58.887 --> 46:02.880
With the traffic...

46:03.567 --> 46:06.559
...and the sharks.
Y'all got sharks.

46:06.727 --> 46:10.037
And when the public be all up
on your private beach?

46:10.207 --> 46:12.880
Right. Right.

46:14.007 --> 46:17.158
You just gotta stick with it
and be yourself.

46:17.327 --> 46:19.841
Don't let anybody tell you
who you are.

46:21.127 --> 46:23.197
You all right, B-Rad.

46:23.847 --> 46:25.280
Shondra?

46:27.567 --> 46:32.482
You know when I was saying earlier,
in the car, about being a player and all?

46:32.887 --> 46:34.843
I was just fooling.

46:36.647 --> 46:39.002
I ain't never been with
a real black girl before.

46:39.167 --> 46:41.283
- For real?
- Well, except on the Internet.

46:43.847 --> 46:47.044
You the finest girl I ever seen
in my whole life.

46:48.607 --> 46:50.404
And I was wondering...

46:51.047 --> 46:53.925
...since they're gonna
ice me in the morning...

46:54.087 --> 46:56.476
...could I, like,
kind of, maybe...

46:57.967 --> 46:59.559
...hopefully...

47:00.287 --> 47:02.164
...kiss you?

47:04.927 --> 47:06.883
You so pretty.

47:07.487 --> 47:09.205
Thank you.

47:21.007 --> 47:22.565
Oh, you real pretty!

47:28.327 --> 47:32.718
Damn, fool! I said kiss! I offered you
a snack, not the whole kitchen!

47:34.447 --> 47:37.120
My bad! My bad!

47:39.167 --> 47:40.805
My bad.

47:43.167 --> 47:46.398
Oh, hell, no! Hell, no!
Get your ass up!

47:46.567 --> 47:48.637
Get your big ass up!
Move!

47:48.807 --> 47:53.278
All right, that's it. This game is whack.
I want my money. Then y'all can get out.

47:53.447 --> 47:56.166
Hey, Shondra,
but we're not done yet.

47:56.327 --> 47:58.318
And you ain't never
gonna be done.

47:58.487 --> 48:02.560
Did it ever occur to you clowns
this might be the way he really is?

48:02.727 --> 48:04.285
No.

48:04.447 --> 48:07.519
Whatever. Look, I did what you asked.
I want my money.

48:07.687 --> 48:11.805
You fail to realize that putting together
this operation has been quite expensive.

48:11.967 --> 48:13.923
Bling bling!

48:14.087 --> 48:15.839
Excuse me?

48:16.007 --> 48:19.079
- I might not have all the money right now.
- Are you playing me?

48:20.207 --> 48:24.803
Y'all better get my money or I'm going
in there and I'm gonna tell him what's up.

48:42.407 --> 48:43.806
Hey, dog.

48:46.087 --> 48:47.725
Down here, dog.

48:51.167 --> 48:52.680

48:52.847 --> 48:56.157

ain't got nothing on me.

48:56.327 --> 48:58.921
Yo, I'm Ronnie Rizzat,
represizzent.

49:00.527 --> 49:01.516
Hey, Ronnie.

49:01.687 --> 49:04.565
- Why you down, dog?
- I'm a failure.

49:04.727 --> 49:06.718
No, it ain't like that, fool.

49:06.887 --> 49:10.675
You need to stop listening to all them
perpetrators and just be yourself.

49:10.847 --> 49:13.805
- For real?
- For rizzeal. Pound it.

49:17.007 --> 49:18.838
Hold up.

49:19.007 --> 49:23.046
You saying if I put my mind to it,
I can be whatever I wanna be?

49:23.207 --> 49:26.005
- Damn straight.

49:26.167 --> 49:28.601
...I can achieve true happiness?
- Word.

49:28.767 --> 49:32.646
And if I work hard, I can be
the biggest rapper there ever was?

49:32.807 --> 49:34.843
Rapper? Hell, no.
You stink.

49:35.647 --> 49:36.636
Don't be hating.

49:36.847 --> 49:39.839
I'd rather eat garbage than listen
to your tired-ass rhymes.

49:41.047 --> 49:44.084
Now look here, man. I'm up
out of here. I gotta go see my lady.

49:44.247 --> 49:46.078
She's a breeder rat at PetCo.

49:46.247 --> 49:49.239
And please believe it. It's all
gonna work out for the best.

49:49.727 --> 49:51.524
Oh, shiznit!

50:10.887 --> 50:14.243
He totally bought it.
The carjack going into the kidnapping.

50:14.407 --> 50:18.241
And we staged a beautiful liquor store
robbery. You should have been there.

50:18.407 --> 50:19.635
Unfortunately...

50:19.807 --> 50:21.604
...he still seems to be posing...

50:21.767 --> 50:26.283
...so we've taken it upon ourselves
to plan a drive-by shooting next.

50:26.447 --> 50:28.642
Mr. Gluckman will be very happy.

50:28.807 --> 50:30.957
It's gonna take more money
than we projected.

50:31.127 --> 50:33.482
We were wondering if
you could give us an advance...

50:33.647 --> 50:34.716
No, no, no, no, no.

50:34.887 --> 50:39.642
You'll get the rest of your money when
Richie Cunningham walks in my door.

50:39.807 --> 50:42.401
- Right. I do under...
- Good.

50:43.967 --> 50:45.958
Mr. Gibbons? Hello?

50:46.327 --> 50:47.726
Damn!

50:48.167 --> 50:50.886
They been playing me all along!

50:51.567 --> 50:53.683
I knew my rhymes was dope!

50:54.087 --> 50:57.159
I knew the 'hood
couldn't be this bad.

50:57.567 --> 50:59.683
How could they do that?

51:00.287 --> 51:01.606
How could she do that?

51:01.767 --> 51:04.565
All right.
The damn fools wanna play?

51:05.367 --> 51:07.039
Then let's play!

51:10.767 --> 51:12.485
What the hell?!

51:14.767 --> 51:16.723
- What the hell are you doing?
- Listen up!

51:17.087 --> 51:18.679
B-Rad G's in the hizzy.

51:18.847 --> 51:22.078
And things are gonna start
changing around here for shizzy.

51:22.247 --> 51:23.999
Do something!

51:24.687 --> 51:28.646
You better shut your mouth, fool! Get
back in that room before I beat your ass.

51:29.607 --> 51:32.485
You feeling froggy?
Then leap.

51:35.087 --> 51:38.238
- Anybody else wanna step?
- No.

51:39.047 --> 51:41.356
- What the hell got into you?
- Shut up, ho!

51:42.887 --> 51:44.286
Ho?!

51:44.447 --> 51:47.200
- Who you calling a ho, ho?
- You, ho!

51:47.607 --> 51:51.646
The same ho that gave up that weak-ass
kiss five minutes ago in the bedroom.

51:51.807 --> 51:53.559
- Really?
- Shondra.

51:53.727 --> 51:55.957
I told you she liked white boys.

51:56.407 --> 52:01.276
- Who do you think you are?
- I'm B-Rad G from 'Bu. Represent.

52:01.447 --> 52:05.565
What y'all didn't realize is, I was
trying to put my mobbing days behind me.

52:05.927 --> 52:08.600
But rolling with y'all
done re-awoke my inner killer.

52:08.767 --> 52:11.520
So let's start dropping bodies!

52:15.327 --> 52:19.764
- Don't stand there! Come on, girl, help us!
- You created that monster. Deal with it!

52:22.287 --> 52:25.279
- Hey, where you going, man?
- I need to take a drive.

52:25.447 --> 52:29.406
- Where you fixing to drive to?
- I think today's a good day to die.

52:31.167 --> 52:33.522
Why you talking crazy, man?
Just be cool. Hey!

52:33.687 --> 52:35.723
I might as well go out

52:35.887 --> 52:38.276
My daddy don't love me,

52:38.447 --> 52:41.917
...I ain't down enough for y'all.
- No, you're down. Isn't he down, PJ?

52:43.127 --> 52:46.597
- Tree, ain't he down?
- Yeah, he down as they come, fool!

52:47.367 --> 52:50.882
- Oh, my God!
- It's a jack!

52:51.047 --> 52:52.719
Get out the car, white boy!

52:53.927 --> 52:56.122
Oh, you that weak fuck

52:57.487 --> 52:59.478
Get your behind

52:59.647 --> 53:01.763
- Got something for me?
- Hell, yeah.

53:01.927 --> 53:04.202
- You ready to die?
- Ain't that a "co-inky-dink."

53:04.367 --> 53:06.756
I was just talking
to my two homeys about that.

53:06.927 --> 53:08.918
- Shut up and move. Move him!
- All right.

53:09.087 --> 53:12.796
But y'all should change up your style
because this jackings is getting tired.

53:12.967 --> 53:17.916
Hey, yo, Bloodbath, if there's one scratch
on my ride, I'm gonna eat your children!

53:18.087 --> 53:20.726
- Shotgun!
- Yo, Deuce, shut him up.

53:21.127 --> 53:22.242
Jesus.

53:22.407 --> 53:25.046
8 Ball, what should we do
with Bloodbath and his friend?

53:25.207 --> 53:27.641
- Nothing.
- I said shotgun.

53:27.807 --> 53:28.956
Know what shotgun means?

53:29.127 --> 53:32.802
Shotgun means I ride in the front.
You better hope I don't piss in your trunk.

53:32.967 --> 53:34.400
Shut up.

53:35.927 --> 53:39.124
Allow me to clear this up for you,
my dogs. My name isn't Bloodbath...

53:39.287 --> 53:41.403
...it's Sean James,
and I'm just an actor...

53:41.567 --> 53:45.276
- Is Shondra hitting that white boy?
- I don't think anyone's hitting anybody.

53:45.447 --> 53:49.076
- She's just in on the scam we have going.
- What you talking about, scams?

53:50.247 --> 53:53.523
Hey, player, we were just hired
to kidnap Bill Gluckman's son, man.

53:53.687 --> 53:56.759
- That's all we was doing.
- Is that that dude running for governor?

53:57.127 --> 53:58.879
- You know him?
- Hell, yeah.

53:59.047 --> 54:01.436
- Down with the bitches and ho's.
- I'm voting for him.

54:01.607 --> 54:03.882
You think we ignorant
because we live in the 'hood?

54:04.047 --> 54:06.083
I didn't say that.

54:06.567 --> 54:10.401
- Man, we would never say that, brother!
- Silence!

54:11.527 --> 54:15.042
Yo, we got Gluckman's son.
Gotta be worth more alive than dead.

54:15.207 --> 54:16.640
- What you think?
- Gotta be.

54:17.207 --> 54:19.198
Grab Fatback. I got Milk Dud.

54:19.367 --> 54:21.278
- Let's roll.
- I'm soft.

54:21.607 --> 54:24.326
The polls say that since Brad
has been out of the picture...

54:24.487 --> 54:26.159
...we have gone up six points.

54:26.327 --> 54:28.477
Yeah, but we're still dead
in the urban demos.

54:28.647 --> 54:30.558
- Gays too.
- We can't win without them.

54:31.047 --> 54:32.560
- Mr. Gibbons?
- Yeah.

54:32.727 --> 54:34.797
I have a Sean on the phone
for you, sir.

54:39.047 --> 54:41.038
Check it out, homes.
Is that him or what?

54:41.207 --> 54:42.959
Yeah, that's Tec
from the l-9s, homes.

54:43.287 --> 54:47.439
Call Cyco. Tell him to bring it all down.
We're gonna have ourself a party tonight.

54:47.887 --> 54:52.085
Mr. Gibbons, we have a real
serious problem here.

54:52.647 --> 54:56.003
- I told you no more money.
- Yes, I realize you said that, but this is...

54:56.167 --> 54:59.045
- We're in really big troub...
- Listen, fool.

54:59.207 --> 55:03.359
Gluckman's boy's been kidnapped
for real, along with your punk-ass friends.

55:03.527 --> 55:05.085
Kidnapped?

55:05.247 --> 55:09.763
If Mr. Governor wants to see his punk
bitch baby boy alive again...

55:09.927 --> 55:12.236
...I want 500 grand
by tomorrow midnight.

55:14.047 --> 55:15.605
How do I know this is real?

55:15.847 --> 55:19.760
What, you think your actors is this good?
Say something!

55:20.647 --> 55:22.399
Please help us.

55:22.967 --> 55:24.764
I am...

55:24.927 --> 55:26.406
...so...

55:27.527 --> 55:29.199
...scared!

55:29.367 --> 55:32.040
Please help us.

55:33.127 --> 55:35.721
- Well?
- Okay. I'm convinced.

55:35.967 --> 55:39.437
- Get my money.
- Fine. I can arrange that, but...

55:39.607 --> 55:41.563
You got 10 minutes.

55:42.527 --> 55:44.165
- Now what?
- We wait.

55:45.287 --> 55:48.085
- What?!
- They want 500 grand or they'll kill him.

55:48.247 --> 55:50.556
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- Oh, come on! Oh, no!

55:50.727 --> 55:52.558
- Oh, my God.
- We're going to jail.

55:52.727 --> 55:55.400
Wait, slow down. Don't panic.

55:55.567 --> 55:57.922
- It was your idea!
- That was idiotic!

55:58.087 --> 56:02.478
Don't panic. Just let me
think this through here.

56:02.647 --> 56:04.239
You're as guilty as any of us.

56:06.567 --> 56:10.526
Now, we may just have
a very interesting opportunity here.

56:10.687 --> 56:13.440
- Where are you going with this?
- The negatives are obvious.

56:13.607 --> 56:16.440
Yeah! Bill drops out of the race,
emotional distress.

56:16.607 --> 56:18.882
I can handle Bill.
What are the positives?

56:19.087 --> 56:21.237
Well, there are just so many.

56:21.407 --> 56:23.682
- No more Brad problem.
- Right.

56:24.807 --> 56:25.796
Right, I like that!

56:25.967 --> 56:29.516
With a dead son, sympathy could spike us
in the female and gay demos.

56:29.687 --> 56:31.040
Wait, I've got the image!

56:31.207 --> 56:33.277
Bill weeping...

56:33.447 --> 56:37.360
...over Brad's open casket.

56:37.527 --> 56:39.518
After grieving,
he goes on the offensive.

56:39.687 --> 56:40.881
- His war on crime!
- Drugs!

56:41.047 --> 56:42.196
- Gangs!
- It's what's hot!

56:42.367 --> 56:44.881
- Oh, that's great!
- It's just what we needed!

56:47.167 --> 56:49.920
- Get over there, man.
- Hold me!

56:50.087 --> 56:51.486
- Who this?
- No deal.

56:51.847 --> 56:54.805
- Say what?
- Bill Gluckman won't deal with criminals.

56:55.047 --> 56:56.958
That's it.
His punk ass is dead.

56:57.127 --> 56:59.846
You do what you have to do.
We'll do what we have to do.

57:00.247 --> 57:01.646
There you go.

57:04.647 --> 57:07.798
That was cold.
Yo, take off the tape.

57:08.807 --> 57:11.765
Goddamn, that hurts
like a motherfick!

57:11.927 --> 57:14.236
I'm gonna have to teach
you all some manners!

57:14.407 --> 57:15.999
Your daddy ain't paying.

57:16.167 --> 57:18.556
- Tell me something I don't know.
- What?

57:18.887 --> 57:22.197
You heard me, you half-stepping,
moist-ass bitch!

57:22.367 --> 57:26.042
- Excuse me?
- You gonna do it like that?

57:26.567 --> 57:29.559
- All right, then. Bring it.
- It's been brought.

57:29.727 --> 57:32.560
Okay, then. That gat's real, right?

57:32.727 --> 57:37.596
So then do it. Put crackerjack
out his misery. Come on, y'all.

57:37.767 --> 57:40.281
- I'll do it myself. Pull the trigger!
- Get him!

57:40.447 --> 57:42.802
This fool is crazy!
I cannot deal with this shit.

57:47.207 --> 57:48.401
Oh, damn!

57:50.207 --> 57:53.119
- Nice. Yeah, this is good.
- Get your ass down, fool!

58:00.927 --> 58:02.883
Y'all take this seriously!

58:03.047 --> 58:05.117
- I love you, Sean.
- I love you too.

58:05.287 --> 58:07.437
Lay down some cover, fool!

58:08.767 --> 58:10.962
We can't!
They too strapped!

58:11.367 --> 58:13.437
"We can't!
they too strapped!"

58:13.847 --> 58:16.441
- What we gonna do?
- "What we gonna do?"

58:18.207 --> 58:22.564
Punks. Give me them gats.
Y'all are serious crazy.

58:22.727 --> 58:25.321
Y'all wanna play?
Then let's play.

58:31.807 --> 58:33.445
Y'all know who you dealing with?

58:33.607 --> 58:36.440
I'm Malibu's most wanted, y'all!

58:36.607 --> 58:40.725
King Kong ain't got
nothing on me!

58:49.607 --> 58:53.282
Damn. These special effects
is the bomb.

58:53.847 --> 58:55.041
- Let's go!
- Let's dip!

58:55.207 --> 58:56.640
Let's go!

59:11.207 --> 59:13.163
It's safe now, y'all.

59:13.327 --> 59:14.555
Hey, yo, that was ill.

59:14.727 --> 59:18.402
And y'all punk asses ain't do nothing.
All that buffness for no reason.

59:18.727 --> 59:20.206
That's him.

59:20.367 --> 59:22.085
Get over here.

59:23.127 --> 59:26.005
- Where you learn that from?
- Grand Theft Auto 3.

59:26.247 --> 59:29.444
- Word? Can I borrow that?
- You got a PlayStation 2?

59:29.767 --> 59:33.123
- No, I got GameCast.
- GameCast?

59:33.287 --> 59:35.437
There's GameCube and Dreamcast.
Which you got?

59:35.607 --> 59:38.405
I said I got GameCast, man.
Damn! I can't afford it!

59:38.567 --> 59:40.637
My bad. I'm just trying to help you out.

59:54.847 --> 59:56.644
I'm gonna holler at you.

59:56.807 --> 59:58.923
- My wigga.
- Hey, what up, my nizzle?

59:59.087 --> 01:00:03.160
What's up, baby? How you doing, man?
I got something for you.

01:00:03.327 --> 01:00:05.124
That's yours, B.

01:00:05.447 --> 01:00:07.517
- Oh, for real?
- Yeah.

01:00:08.167 --> 01:00:10.078
Yo, you shouldn't have.

01:00:10.887 --> 01:00:12.957
Serious moment. Bring it in, y'all.

01:00:13.127 --> 01:00:17.086
Welcome to the Nines, baby.
Only way out now is in a box.

01:00:17.927 --> 01:00:20.316
- In a box?
- In a box.

01:00:21.367 --> 01:00:24.325
Oh, in a box. Right.

01:00:39.527 --> 01:00:41.438
Good evening, I'm Hal Fishman.

01:00:41.607 --> 01:00:44.644
We open tonight
with a Channel 5 News exclusive.

01:00:44.807 --> 01:00:47.526
A security camera
captured incredible footage...

01:00:47.687 --> 01:00:52.841
...of gang violence tonight as it
flared on the streets of South Central.

01:00:53.007 --> 01:00:57.956
This hardcore gangster,
believed to be the notorious White Kong...

01:00:58.127 --> 01:01:00.925
...ringleader of a South Central
street gang...

01:01:01.087 --> 01:01:06.480
...fired his weapons with wanton
disregard for life or personal property.

01:01:06.647 --> 01:01:09.798
If you have any information
on the whereabouts of this man...

01:01:09.967 --> 01:01:14.722
...call our KTLA hotline
at 800- 1-SNITCH.

01:01:14.887 --> 01:01:20.200
Oh, my God!

01:01:24.087 --> 01:01:27.921
Yo, that is some hardcore shnizit.

01:01:28.447 --> 01:01:30.039
Damn, Moch, what are we gonna do?

01:01:30.767 --> 01:01:33.440
We're gonna bounce back
to our respective cribs...

01:01:33.607 --> 01:01:37.361
...jack our mom and dad's biggest gats,
jet to South Central and save his ass.

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:38.846
- Word.
- Word.

01:01:39.567 --> 01:01:43.082
Hey, Bradley's been involved
in a gang shooting.

01:01:43.247 --> 01:01:46.080
What?
No, it couldn't be. No.

01:01:46.247 --> 01:01:49.045
His face is all over the news.
I think I'd know my own son.

01:01:49.367 --> 01:01:51.961
All right, well, I'm sure
there's a logical explanation.

01:01:52.087 --> 01:01:53.998
Get some sleep
and let me take care of it.

01:01:54.167 --> 01:01:57.125
Sleep? He's shooting the hell
out of South Central. Let's go get him.

01:01:57.287 --> 01:02:00.882
No! Bill, you have a debate
tomorrow in Sacramento.

01:02:01.047 --> 01:02:03.163
The hell with the debate.

01:02:03.327 --> 01:02:05.682
Cancel that and you can kiss
this campaign goodbye.

01:02:05.847 --> 01:02:08.884
Shove the debate up your ass.
I'm not gonna lose my son over this.

01:02:09.047 --> 01:02:11.163
Listen, I understand you're upset...

01:02:11.327 --> 01:02:16.117
...but for once in your life will you think
outside the box? For once?

01:02:16.287 --> 01:02:18.960
This whole thing, this whole Brad thing
with the gangs...

01:02:19.127 --> 01:02:21.083
...we can spin it.
Make it into a positive.

01:02:21.247 --> 01:02:23.477
- Positive?
- lf he's arrested or injured...

01:02:23.647 --> 01:02:25.558
...we can spin it
so you're the victim.

01:02:25.727 --> 01:02:29.356
- "Crime reaches everyone" kind of thing.
- Are you trying to get votes out of this?

01:02:29.527 --> 01:02:31.802
I'm trying to win
and you don't seem to care!

01:02:31.967 --> 01:02:35.039
- I'm his father!
- Since when?

01:02:38.647 --> 01:02:41.320
Since right now.

01:02:42.527 --> 01:02:44.802
And you're fired.

01:02:55.527 --> 01:02:59.520
We need to brainstorm
on how I get my job back.

01:03:06.407 --> 01:03:07.726
Hello, this is OnStar.

01:03:07.887 --> 01:03:13.245
I'm looking for a location
of the license number D-SHIZNIT.

01:03:13.407 --> 01:03:16.797
That vehicle is at the corner
of McKinley and 82nd Street, sir.

01:03:29.927 --> 01:03:32.122
What are you supposed to be?
Robo-bitch?

01:03:34.087 --> 01:03:36.681
All right, Monster, what are you packing?

01:03:37.447 --> 01:03:39.199
- This.
- What is that?

01:03:39.367 --> 01:03:41.835
My pop's spear gat, from the yacht.

01:03:42.007 --> 01:03:44.316
What is he hunting, Flipper?

01:03:46.167 --> 01:03:48.317
Think you so bad.

01:03:48.487 --> 01:03:50.478
- What you got?
- Never mind.

01:03:50.647 --> 01:03:54.606
- Come on, let's see it.
- All right, chill. Chill.

01:03:57.367 --> 01:04:00.598
- Is that a freaking musket?
- Yeah, it's a freaking musket.

01:04:00.767 --> 01:04:03.361
Shut up! Shut up, you damn posers!

01:04:04.647 --> 01:04:09.437
- Hadji, how about you?
- I couldn't get much, yo. Just this.

01:04:11.047 --> 01:04:12.924
Oh, my God.

01:04:15.287 --> 01:04:19.838
- Dang! Where'd you get all that?
- Christmas present from Uncle Ahmet.

01:04:22.487 --> 01:04:24.159
Mercedes-Benz, may I help you?

01:04:24.327 --> 01:04:29.481
Hell, yes, chickenhead! I need
a location on license plate D-SHIZNIT.

01:04:30.087 --> 01:04:33.557
That car is on the corner
of McKinley and 82nd Street.

01:04:57.487 --> 01:04:59.796
- Where's he going?
- Are they making a sandwich?

01:05:05.087 --> 01:05:07.442
He's the mayonnaise
between the wheat bread.

01:05:07.607 --> 01:05:09.882
Go, Brad! Get some black ass!

01:05:10.967 --> 01:05:12.719
Get some black ass.

01:05:22.367 --> 01:05:26.326
- Where's B-Rad at?
- I haven't seen a thing. Haven't seen him.

01:05:26.487 --> 01:05:30.241
- Shondra? A little help, please?
- Sit your monkey ass down. Don't move.

01:05:31.287 --> 01:05:33.881
What you know about this?
What you know about that?

01:05:34.047 --> 01:05:36.880
- You want some of this crotch?
- Yeah, he does.

01:05:37.367 --> 01:05:39.039
Get it, girl.

01:05:39.207 --> 01:05:42.916
You know what?
You know, I just tested positive...

01:05:43.327 --> 01:05:46.285
...for G-A-M-E.

01:05:46.447 --> 01:05:49.996
- All right, gangsta.
- Come on, girl. Let's do this.

01:05:50.167 --> 01:05:51.805
- Okay.
- We gonna show you something.

01:05:51.967 --> 01:05:55.039
- Wait till you see what we're gonna do.
- I ain't mad at nothing.

01:05:55.207 --> 01:05:57.641
- I wanna learn.
- You wanna learn?

01:05:57.807 --> 01:06:01.766
I like that.
I'm ready for the chocolate love.

01:06:02.407 --> 01:06:04.841
- Shondra?
- Yeah, it's Shondra...

01:06:05.007 --> 01:06:07.282
...but I guess I wasn't
good enough for you.

01:06:07.447 --> 01:06:10.280
- What?
- You had to get two more.

01:06:10.447 --> 01:06:11.960
- No, she didn't.
- Yes, she did.

01:06:12.127 --> 01:06:16.279
This no-good, deadbeat, weak-ass
white boy won't take care of little Malik.

01:06:16.447 --> 01:06:19.519
- Malik?
- Or Taquayzsha.

01:06:19.687 --> 01:06:21.917
- Taquayzsha?
- Or Nahojay.

01:06:22.087 --> 01:06:24.601
- Naho-who?
- Oh, no, now that's trifling.

01:06:24.767 --> 01:06:26.883
- Let's get out of here.
- Thank you, girl.

01:06:27.047 --> 01:06:29.925
No problem, ladies. Okay, bye-bye.

01:06:30.087 --> 01:06:33.204
Damn. Why you throwing salt
on my G-A-M-E?

01:06:33.367 --> 01:06:36.643
I am saving your lily-white ass.
Now come on.

01:06:36.807 --> 01:06:39.401
I ain't going nowhere.
I'm a l-9 now.

01:06:40.047 --> 01:06:41.878
Peep my tat.

01:06:42.207 --> 01:06:45.597
- Listen, fool...
- No, you listen. I know what you done.

01:06:45.767 --> 01:06:49.680
How this whole thing is fake.
The stickup, the kidnap, the whole nizzy.

01:06:51.287 --> 01:06:54.962
- Damn.
- No, you damn. Why you play me?

01:06:55.127 --> 01:06:58.881
- For the money.
- Money? What you need money for?

01:06:59.047 --> 01:07:03.598
Look, fool, this may sound stupid to you,
but not everybody has money.

01:07:03.767 --> 01:07:06.235
And for the people who don't,
money is important.

01:07:06.407 --> 01:07:08.716
You're probably still flipping me
and whatnot.

01:07:08.887 --> 01:07:12.323
Damn it, B-Rad, this is real.
Tec and his crew are real.

01:07:12.487 --> 01:07:14.000
Oh, really?

01:07:14.167 --> 01:07:17.762
Well, then if Tec is real,
then this gat must be real.

01:07:17.927 --> 01:07:21.920
And if this gat is real,
then the bullets in it have got to be real.

01:07:22.087 --> 01:07:25.602
And seeing how my foot is real,
this would really hurt.

01:07:27.007 --> 01:07:30.443
See that? I just shot my foot.

01:07:32.967 --> 01:07:35.356
And it's real!

01:07:35.527 --> 01:07:41.079
Oh, my God, this whole thing is real!
I just shot my foot.

01:07:41.247 --> 01:07:43.841
I just shot my foot.
I just shot my foot.

01:07:44.007 --> 01:07:46.805
Sit. Stop hopping around, fool.
Goodness.

01:07:46.967 --> 01:07:50.323
- Oh, God. Oh, Shondra, I'm dying!
- This cap barely grazed you.

01:07:50.487 --> 01:07:53.285
- I can't live!
- Lucky you such a weak-ass shot.

01:07:53.447 --> 01:07:57.281
- Then it's real. This whole thing is real!
- Stop moving.

01:07:57.767 --> 01:08:01.237
- Hey, who doing all that popping up...
- Oh, God.

01:08:01.967 --> 01:08:04.765
Hey, what the hell?
Hey, what up, cuz?

01:08:04.927 --> 01:08:10.524
Hey, Tec! My road dog, yeah.
Just the man I want to see.

01:08:11.167 --> 01:08:13.442
- You know Shondra.
- What's going on, Shondra?

01:08:13.607 --> 01:08:16.484
- Tec, I swear, it is not what it looks like.
- Don't lie to me.

01:08:16.647 --> 01:08:18.956
That was my line
and it always was what it looked like.

01:08:19.247 --> 01:08:22.683
- What's going on with your boyfriend?
- I'd love to kick it with you...

01:08:22.846 --> 01:08:25.486
...and run this thizzang,
but I got business back in Bu...

01:08:25.647 --> 01:08:28.115
...something with Dre-Dre.
So if you don't mind...

01:08:28.287 --> 01:08:30.118
I do mind!

01:08:30.447 --> 01:08:34.406
Wait, Tec, let me explain.
Because I don't belong here.

01:08:34.647 --> 01:08:37.444
What, you done forgot already, fool?
I done told you.

01:08:37.607 --> 01:08:41.759
There's only one way out of the l-9s.
And your E-ticket's in this here chamber.

01:08:42.167 --> 01:08:44.761
There it is. Did you see
how committed he was?

01:08:44.926 --> 01:08:47.520
That's the rage I was talking about.

01:08:47.687 --> 01:08:50.962
Tec, please don't be hating.

01:08:52.006 --> 01:08:54.600
I won't let you do it, Tec.

01:08:54.886 --> 01:08:57.276
Fine. Then I'll just do
the both of you, then.

01:09:11.687 --> 01:09:14.326
Damn, fool! You just hit my house!

01:09:14.487 --> 01:09:16.398
- Brad?
- Pops?

01:09:16.567 --> 01:09:18.080
It's Mr. Gluckman.

01:09:18.247 --> 01:09:19.600
Brad, you okay?

01:09:19.767 --> 01:09:22.645
Not really. And unless you
seriously strapped...

01:09:22.807 --> 01:09:25.719
...you about to not really be okay too.

01:09:29.287 --> 01:09:32.962
- Hi. Bill Gluckman, running for governor.
- We know who you are, fool.

01:09:33.287 --> 01:09:36.323
This dude thinks we ignorant
just because we live down here.

01:09:36.487 --> 01:09:39.684
- You better recognize.
- Well, I recognize.

01:09:39.846 --> 01:09:45.638
You know, I recognize that street violence
is tearing Californians apart.

01:09:45.807 --> 01:09:48.765
And, fellas, California is my family.

01:09:49.926 --> 01:09:51.599
Oh, and here's a thought.

01:09:51.767 --> 01:09:56.318
Instead of thinking about what set we're
from, what crew you're rolling with...

01:09:57.367 --> 01:10:00.803
...why can't we just be brothers?
What do you say?

01:10:02.727 --> 01:10:05.241
I guess I never thought of it
like that before.

01:10:05.407 --> 01:10:07.159
- You see that?
- Please.

01:10:07.527 --> 01:10:09.757
What do we say, brothers?

01:10:11.687 --> 01:10:13.882
Get your ass out of here.

01:10:19.847 --> 01:10:22.680
Don't anybody know
where the goddamn driveway is?!

01:10:30.567 --> 01:10:31.682
Hadji?

01:10:31.847 --> 01:10:34.441
Y'all better step,
or I'm gonna have to waste y'all.

01:10:34.567 --> 01:10:38.355
- Yeah, drop your gats!
- No, drop your gats!

01:10:39.847 --> 01:10:44.841
Hold up, y'all! Before anybody
ices anybody, I got something to say.

01:10:45.767 --> 01:10:48.804
You really weren't gonna
pay my ransom?

01:10:49.247 --> 01:10:53.957
Oh, I didn't know anything about that.
You gotta believe me.

01:10:54.127 --> 01:10:57.164
- That was not part of the plan.
- What was the plan?

01:10:57.327 --> 01:10:59.363
Send me down here
to scare me white?

01:10:59.527 --> 01:11:03.281
I know, it was stupid. I tried everything,
I didn't know how to deal with you.

01:11:03.447 --> 01:11:05.642
That's because you don't know me...

01:11:05.807 --> 01:11:08.321
...and you never cared to find out.

01:11:08.647 --> 01:11:13.118
Listen, I made a lot of mistakes.
I know that. I'm not proud of myself.

01:11:14.407 --> 01:11:16.443
I wasn't there for you.

01:11:16.807 --> 01:11:20.163
I can't change that,
but I always loved you.

01:11:20.927 --> 01:11:26.001
And I still do. And if you say that this
is who you really are, I believe you.

01:11:26.167 --> 01:11:29.523
And I accept you.
And from here on in...

01:11:30.807 --> 01:11:33.526
...I promise to be a real father to you.

01:11:34.167 --> 01:11:37.955
- Talk is cheap. Prove it.
- Well, I'm here, ain't I?

01:11:45.767 --> 01:11:49.726
All right, Pops. We cool.

01:11:54.567 --> 01:11:56.125
Much love.

01:12:04.287 --> 01:12:07.199
I wish I could talk to my pops like that.

01:12:07.767 --> 01:12:09.359
No doubt.

01:12:09.767 --> 01:12:11.962
I'm gonna call that nigga right now.

01:12:12.127 --> 01:12:14.721
Would you get your emotional
gangsta ass together?

01:12:14.847 --> 01:12:18.203
We got business to handle.
Let's smoke these fools!

01:12:21.407 --> 01:12:25.844
Tec, before we all smoke each other,
can I say one little more thing?

01:12:26.207 --> 01:12:30.246
- What you got to say this time?
- Kick it freestyle, Moch.

01:12:31.887 --> 01:12:33.115
What, what, what

01:12:33.287 --> 01:12:35.198
Yo, I said what's up
With all this fightin '

01:12:35.367 --> 01:12:37.278
We should be unitin '
Egos need deflatin '

01:12:37.447 --> 01:12:38.800
Gangstas, please quit hatin '

01:12:38.967 --> 01:12:41.197
- Stop.
- We ain 't hens, we come out the coop

01:12:41.367 --> 01:12:43.961
- Sometimes I get backed up, I gotta poop
- Stop. Stop it!

01:12:45.447 --> 01:12:48.917
You say one more line
and I'm gonna have to smoke myself!

01:12:49.647 --> 01:12:51.205
All right.

01:12:51.487 --> 01:12:54.081
But all these gats got to go.

01:12:55.967 --> 01:12:58.083
I'm serious, Tec.

01:12:58.247 --> 01:13:00.477
Ain't no more gats.

01:13:01.247 --> 01:13:05.206
B-Rad's right. All this hating is whack.

01:13:19.927 --> 01:13:21.565
Run!

01:13:53.207 --> 01:13:55.801
No, listen to me.
You really not listening to me.

01:13:55.967 --> 01:13:58.356
If this ain't rebuilt
by the time Moms get back...

01:13:58.527 --> 01:14:00.995
...it's on you.
You gonna get the punishment.

01:14:01.167 --> 01:14:05.285
You gonna laugh at me. You gonna
play me?! You know who you playing?

01:14:05.447 --> 01:14:08.166
I have two witnesses
who were at the scene of the explosion.

01:14:08.327 --> 01:14:11.558
- Can you tell us what happened?
- Oh, yeah, it was crazy, yo.

01:14:11.727 --> 01:14:14.366
All these crazy fools came over
strapped with they 9s.

01:14:14.527 --> 01:14:17.485
I was just, like, telling the brothers,
"Let's talk about this.

01:14:17.647 --> 01:14:21.037
Let's talk this out.
Can't we all just get along?

01:14:21.207 --> 01:14:24.756
Let's find our common ground."
I was trying to keep the peace.

01:14:24.927 --> 01:14:29.443
Really, the explosion
was just a metaphor.

01:14:29.607 --> 01:14:33.282
A metaphor for anger within our hearts.

01:14:33.447 --> 01:14:37.759
- Because the white man...
- Okay, thank you, Bloodbath and Tree.

01:14:38.407 --> 01:14:40.318
All this mayhem is rumored
to have been caused...

01:14:40.487 --> 01:14:44.480
...by the mysterious White Kong,
who is still at large.

01:14:44.647 --> 01:14:48.720
This is Soon-Yee Baxter Hernandez
reporting from South Central.

01:14:49.287 --> 01:14:50.720
- Sorry, sir.
- Damn.

01:14:50.887 --> 01:14:52.479
Are you all right?

01:14:52.847 --> 01:14:55.520
You mean, besides the fact
that I just been harpooned?

01:14:57.087 --> 01:14:59.885
Yeah. No.

01:15:00.807 --> 01:15:03.196
- I'm confused.
- About what?

01:15:03.367 --> 01:15:06.245
I don't know what was real
and what wasn't.

01:15:14.247 --> 01:15:17.876
Well, I definitely could use
a little bit more of that reality.

01:15:26.647 --> 01:15:29.241
What's up? I thought the kitchen
was open for business.

01:15:29.407 --> 01:15:33.366
It is open, but you don't put your hands
in a sista's hair. Damn, fool.

01:15:33.527 --> 01:15:35.040
My bad.

01:15:35.527 --> 01:15:37.165
Here you go, boo.

01:15:37.327 --> 01:15:39.363
All right, here we go.

01:15:39.847 --> 01:15:43.886
Shondra's Salon is now
officially open for business.

01:15:44.047 --> 01:15:46.163
- The chickens be out the coop.
- Enjoy, ladies.

01:15:46.327 --> 01:15:51.685
Damn. She got in a fight with
a hair dryer. And the hair dryer won.

01:15:53.767 --> 01:15:55.519
Hold up, girl.

01:15:56.327 --> 01:15:58.079
I just wanna thank you.

01:15:58.247 --> 01:16:01.239
You the only person that accepted me
for who I really am.

01:16:01.407 --> 01:16:03.284
I appreciate that.

01:16:03.607 --> 01:16:07.043
You also kidnapped me, carjacked me
and tried to scare me white.

01:16:07.207 --> 01:16:09.118
I'm gonna let that one go.

01:16:10.287 --> 01:16:13.484
- Come here, boo.
- Come on.

01:16:14.167 --> 01:16:19.400
- My own little White Kong.
- That's right, White Kong.

01:16:20.847 --> 01:16:24.237
It's official: Bill Gluckman
is California 's next governor.

01:16:24.407 --> 01:16:26.398
Let's go live to the big celebration.

01:16:27.487 --> 01:16:32.959
Here he is, right here, y'all.
The man of the hour! Bill Gluckman, y'all!

01:16:33.127 --> 01:16:35.118
Go Gluck yourself!

01:16:45.527 --> 01:16:48.325
Great. We're gonna take it
to a whole new level.

01:16:52.127 --> 01:16:55.005
He became Black Superhero.

01:17:01.527 --> 01:17:02.562
Hello.

01:17:02.727 --> 01:17:04.638
What the f* *k was that?

01:17:05.807 --> 01:17:08.799
Yeah, you got something to represent?

01:17:21.167 --> 01:17:23.442
- Oh, my God.

01:17:23.607 --> 01:17:25.837
- You think I'm playing with you?
- Yeah, you playing.

01:17:26.007 --> 01:17:26.996
Open the door!

01:17:27.167 --> 01:17:30.125
Hey, yo, dog, you know

01:17:31.047 --> 01:17:33.880
Hey, yo, dog,

01:17:38.927 --> 01:17:42.715
You think I'm cute?

01:17:43.047 --> 01:17:46.005
- Look at me, black.

01:17:47.567 --> 01:17:50.001
Hey, yo, dog,

01:17:51.567 --> 01:17:54.445
Hey, yo, dog,

01:18:21.567 --> 01:18:23.444
Get your ass in there.

01:18:23.767 --> 01:18:25.120
Okay.

01:18:25.607 --> 01:18:27.404
Coming from Malibu
B-Rad is a Jew

01:18:27.567 --> 01:18:29.603
But I like him anyhoo
Because that's how we do

01:18:29.767 --> 01:18:32.884
