09:27.700 --> 09:28.689
Mr. Shane: YEAH. JUST DON'T

09:28.700 --> 09:29.689
TELL MY GIRLFRIEND.

09:29.700 --> 09:33.363
[BOTH LAUGH]

09:33.370 --> 09:34.359
WHAT'S THAT?

09:34.370 --> 09:35.394
Christian: BLEACHING CREAM.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.833
TWICE A DAY FOR A WEEK.

09:36.840 --> 09:37.829
IT OUGHT TO TAKE CARE OF ANY

09:37.840 --> 09:41.936
REDNESS THAT REMAINS.

09:41.940 --> 09:43.146
Mr. Shane: SO, BY MY HONEYMOON,

09:43.150 --> 09:46.039
NO SIGN OF THE SCAR.

09:46.050 --> 09:47.711
Christian: OR YOUR MONEY BACK.

ACCORDING TO THE PAPER, THERE

10:06.270 --> 10:09.364

10:09.370 --> 10:10.359

10:10.370 --> 10:11.359
Matt: I MEAN WHO COULD IDENTIFY

10:11.370 --> 10:16.307
US.

10:18.680 --> 10:19.669
Matt: WE HAVE TO GO TO THE

10:19.680 --> 10:20.840
HOSPITAL AND FIND OUT WHAT SHE

10:20.850 --> 10:22.738
KNOWS.

10:22.750 --> 10:23.739

10:23.750 --> 10:25.012
THE SOYBEAN OIL IMPLANT.

10:25.020 --> 10:26.715
IT'S LIGHTER THAN THE SALINE.

Megan: THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M

10:27.790 --> 10:31.920
LOOKING FOR, SOMETHING LIGHTER.

10:31.930 --> 10:33.921

10:49.850 --> 10:51.306
I WANNA GET THE IMPLANTS.

10:51.310 --> 10:52.299
Sean: THE DOOR'S CLOSED.

10:52.310 --> 10:53.311
WE DON'T HAVE TO PRETEND.

11:32.220 --> 11:35.781
Matt: UH...WE'RE FRIENDS.

11:35.790 --> 11:36.825
Kate: HOW DID YOU AND CARA MEET,

11:36.830 --> 11:38.149

CLUB?

11:41.500 --> 11:44.162
Kate: REALLY.

11:44.170 --> 11:46.229
CARA FOUNDED THAT CLUB.

11:46.230 --> 11:47.231
I THOUGHT SHE COULDN'T FIND

11:47.240 --> 11:53.509
ANYBODY ELSE TO JOIN.

11:53.510 --> 12:00.109
Matt: HAS SHE, UH...WOKEN UP?

12:00.120 --> 12:02.884
Kate: NOT SINCE THE ACCIDENT.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.949
SHE'S NOT RESPONDING.

12:04.950 --> 12:06.247
THE DOCTORS SAY ON A COMA SCALE

12:06.250 --> 12:08.389
SHE'S A 6.

12:08.390 --> 12:10.085
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT THE

12:10.090 --> 12:11.079
DOCTORS SAY IT'S ALMOST A

12:11.090 --> 12:12.819
BLESSING.

12:12.830 --> 12:14.092
SHE'S BREATHING ON HER OWN,

12:14.100 --> 12:18.992
AND...SHE'S NOT IN ANY PAIN.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.264
Matt: SHE'S NOT ANY MEDICATION?

12:21.270 --> 12:22.259
Kate: NO. THAT'S AGAINST OUR

12:22.270 --> 12:24.158
BELIEFS.

12:24.170 --> 12:26.434
WE'RE CHRISTIAN SCIENTISTS.

12:26.440 --> 12:27.577
DIDN'T CARA TELL YOU THAT AT

12:27.580 --> 12:29.138
YOUR PRAYER CLUB MEETING?

12:29.140 --> 12:33.918
Matt: YES, UM...SO THIS WOULD BE

12:33.920 --> 12:36.548
WHAT SHE'D WANT.

12:36.550 --> 12:38.188
Kate: SOMETIMES SHE STRUGGLES

12:38.190 --> 12:40.317
WITH HER FAITH, AS I DID WHEN I

12:40.320 --> 12:43.084
WAS HER AGE.

12:43.090 --> 12:45.081
THE ACNE, YOU KNOW? [CHUCKLES]

12:45.090 --> 12:46.421
SHE WANTED TO TRY THE PROACT IV,

12:46.430 --> 12:48.421
BUT WE COULDN'T DO THAT.

12:48.430 --> 12:49.419
AND I WOULD TELL HER,

12:49.430 --> 12:51.489
SWEETHEART, THE LIGHT IN YOU IS

12:51.500 --> 12:53.968
SO BRIGHT.

12:53.970 --> 12:55.335
THAT LIGHT WILL ONE DAY BRING

12:55.340 --> 12:58.434
SOMEONE INTO YOUR LIFE THAT WILL

12:58.440 --> 13:03.605
LIKE YOU FOR WHO YOU REALLY ARE.

13:03.610 --> 13:06.875
AND IN YOU WALK.

13:06.880 --> 13:12.284
GOD BLESS YOU, MATT.

13:12.290 --> 13:16.920
Matt: HOW BADLY WAS SHE HURT?

13:16.930 --> 13:18.158
Kate: THERE ARE 14 BONES IN THE

13:18.160 --> 13:19.525
HUMAN FACE.

13:19.530 --> 13:21.122
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

13:21.130 --> 13:23.121
ACCORDING TO THE DOCTORS, SHE

13:23.130 --> 13:24.495
BROKE 10.

13:24.500 --> 13:25.592
WHEN THEY FOUND HER IN THE

13:25.600 --> 13:27.864
DITCH, HER FACE WAS SO SWOLLEN

13:27.870 --> 13:30.532
THAT...IT DIDN'T EVEN LOOK LIKE

13:30.540 --> 13:36.433
A PERSON.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.908
SHE WILL GET BETTER.

13:38.910 --> 13:43.847
I KNOW IT.

13:48.060 --> 13:52.997
Kate: WILL YOU PRAY WITH ME?

13:59.270 --> 14:01.363
[KATE BREATHES DEEPLY]

14:01.370 --> 14:02.632

14:07.110 --> 14:09.533
IT'S SUCH A BLESSING.

14:09.540 --> 14:11.246
PLEASE HELP CARA TO HEAL IN THE

14:11.250 --> 14:15.368
MANNER THAT YOU SEE FIT.

14:15.380 --> 14:17.416
[CRYING]

14:17.420 --> 14:22.653
AND, FATHER...

14:22.660 --> 14:23.979
PLEASE HELP THEM FIND THE

14:23.990 --> 14:28.927
MONSTER WHO DID THIS TO HER.

14:36.940 --> 14:38.237
Grace: MRS. O'HARA, AFTER

14:38.240 --> 14:39.537
LOOKING AT YOUR CHART I HAVE TO

14:39.540 --> 14:41.474
SAY I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.107
YOU DECIDED NOT TO HAVE BREAST

14:43.110 --> 14:44.338
RECONSTRUCTION DURING YOUR

14:44.350 --> 14:45.339
SURGERY.

14:45.350 --> 14:46.942
YOU THEN CAME IN FOR A

14:46.950 --> 14:48.372
CONSULTATION AND AGAIN DECIDED

14:48.380 --> 14:49.984
AGAINST IMPLANTS.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.309
NOW YOU SUDDENLY WANT THEM.

14:51.320 --> 14:52.389
HAS SOMETHING IN YOUR LIFE

14:52.390 --> 14:54.119
CHANGED RECENTLY THAT'S LED YOU

14:54.120 --> 14:57.328
TO THIS DECISION?

14:57.330 --> 14:58.729
Sean: I AGREE THAT THE IMPLANTS

14:58.730 --> 15:00.948
AREN'T NECESSARY.

15:00.960 --> 15:02.222
Grace: SO YOU'RE AGAINST THE

15:02.230 --> 15:03.219
SURGERY, THEN?

15:03.230 --> 15:04.219
Sean: WELL, NO. IT'S

15:04.230 --> 15:05.424
MRS. O'HARA'S CHOICE.

15:05.430 --> 15:06.465
IT'S HER BODY.

15:06.470 --> 15:08.529
I THINK, AND I'VE TOLD HER THIS,

15:08.540 --> 15:10.030
THAT SHE LOOKS SPECTACULAR WITH

15:10.040 --> 15:14.500
OR WITHOUT BREASTS.

15:14.510 --> 15:15.499
Megan: NO ONE'S EVER SAID THAT

15:15.510 --> 15:17.603
TO ME BEFORE.

15:17.610 --> 15:21.478
Grace: NOT EVEN YOUR HUSBAND?

15:21.480 --> 15:22.674
Megan: JIM WASN'T VERY

15:22.680 --> 15:24.489
COMMUNICATIVE.

15:24.490 --> 15:25.479
Grace: UNLIKE THE PERSON YOU'RE

15:25.490 --> 15:27.549
SEEING NOW?

15:27.560 --> 15:28.549
Megan: I DIDN'T SAY I WAS

15:28.560 --> 15:29.618
SEEING ANYONE.

15:29.620 --> 15:31.588
Grace: OH. I'M SORRY. IJUST

15:31.590 --> 15:33.228
JUMPED TO THE NEW PARTNER, NEW

15:33.230 --> 15:35.050
SET OF PRESSURES THEORY.

15:35.060 --> 15:36.288
FOR MANY WOMEN, BREASTS ARE THE

15:36.300 --> 15:39.724
ROOT PLACE OF SEXUAL CONFIDENCE.

15:39.730 --> 15:41.436
Megan: THAT'S RIGHT.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.431
I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT.

15:47.680 --> 15:52.003
Megan: I AM DATING SOMEONE.

15:52.010 --> 15:56.049
NO, IT'S MORE THAN THAT. I'M...

15:56.050 --> 15:58.610
I'M IN LOVE WITH HIM.

15:58.620 --> 16:00.019
IT'S THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS

16:00.020 --> 16:03.319
I FELT THIS ALIVE, AND AFTER THE

16:03.330 --> 16:06.026
CHEMO AND THE PAIN AND THE...

16:06.030 --> 16:09.022
LIVING DEATH, I WANT TO EMBRACE

16:09.030 --> 16:10.361
THESE FEELINGS WITH EVERY OUNCE

16:10.370 --> 16:12.167
OF MY BEING.

16:19.370 --> 16:22.373
Megan: I WANNA MAKE LOVE TO HIM

16:22.380 --> 16:25.804
WITH THE LIGHTS ON...WITHOUT

16:25.810 --> 16:27.471
WORRYING ABOUT RACING TO A LAMP

16:27.480 --> 16:30.779
BECAUSE I'M SELF-CONSCIOUS.

16:30.790 --> 16:33.111
I DON'T WANT TO EDIT ONE MINUTE

16:33.120 --> 16:35.350
OF MY LIFE.

16:35.360 --> 16:40.195
Sean: DON'T DO IT FOR HIM.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.224
Megan: NO, I'M DOING IT FOR

16:41.230 --> 16:43.425
ME, SEAN.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.129
Grace: HE'S HAVING AN AFFAIR

16:48.140 --> 16:49.129
WITH HER.

16:49.140 --> 16:50.129
Christian: WHY WOULD YOU ASSUME

16:50.140 --> 16:51.129
THAT?

16:51.140 --> 16:52.129
Grace: BECAUSE OF THEIR

16:52.140 --> 16:53.129
INTERACTION--SHE ADMITTED IN

16:53.140 --> 16:54.129
THE ROOM THAT SHE WAS IN LOVE

16:54.140 --> 16:55.129
WITH HIM.

16:55.140 --> 16:56.129
Christian: SEAN'S NOT THE

16:56.140 --> 16:57.141
CHEATING KIND.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.139
Grace: THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY

16:58.150 --> 17:00.141
TRUE--70°/o OF ALL MEN CHEAT.

17:00.150 --> 17:02.710
THE STATISTICS ARE ASTOUNDING.

17:02.720 --> 17:03.709
NO, I'M DISTURBED BY THIS.

17:03.720 --> 17:05.210
A PLASTIC SURGEON GIVING HIS

17:05.220 --> 17:06.380
MISTRESS IMPLANTS SO THAT SHE

17:06.390 --> 17:07.812
CAN BE MORE SEXUALLY UNINHIBITED

17:07.820 --> 17:08.809
WITH HIM.

17:08.820 --> 17:10.458
DON'T YOU FIND THAT UNSETTLING?

17:10.460 --> 17:11.449
WAIT A MINUTE.

17:11.460 --> 17:12.688
WHO AM I TALKING WITH?

17:12.690 --> 17:15.352
OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T.

17:15.360 --> 17:17.191
SHE'S BEEN THROUGH CANCER, NOW

17:17.200 --> 17:18.428
A SEPARATION.

17:18.430 --> 17:19.419
I DON'T KNOW. THIS PATIENT JUST

17:19.430 --> 17:20.431
SEEMS SO FRAGILE TO ME.

17:20.440 --> 17:21.429
I DON'T WANT HER MAKING A RASH

17:21.440 --> 17:22.429
DECISION FOR THE WRONG REASONS.

17:22.440 --> 17:23.429
Christian: YOU WANT ME TO TALK

17:23.440 --> 17:24.429
TO HIM?

17:24.440 --> 17:25.429
Grace: NO. IF I MAKE AN

17:25.440 --> 17:26.429
ACCUSATION THAT'S UNFOUNDED, HE

17:26.440 --> 17:27.429
COULD FIRE ME.

17:27.440 --> 17:30.603
BUT MAYBE YOU COULD FEEL IT OUT.

17:30.610 --> 17:31.599
WHEN HE TALKS TO YOU ABOUT

17:31.610 --> 17:33.146
DEVON GRECO, CASUALLY MENTION

17:33.150 --> 17:34.617
THE IMPLANTS AND SEE IF YOU

17:34.620 --> 17:35.609
SENSE ANYTHING.

17:35.620 --> 17:36.712
Christian: WHOA, KILLER, BACK

17:36.720 --> 17:38.119
UP--WHY WOULD SEAN TALK TO ME

17:38.120 --> 17:39.109
ABOUT DEVON GRECO?

17:39.120 --> 17:40.109
I BOUNCED HER CASE OVER TO

17:40.120 --> 17:41.189
HARGROVE.

17:41.190 --> 17:42.179
Grace: SHE WAS VERY UPSET BY

17:42.190 --> 17:43.179
YOUR NONCHALANCE.

17:43.190 --> 17:44.384
SHE ASKED IF THERE WAS ANOTHER

17:44.390 --> 17:45.584
DOCTOR HERE SHE COULD SPEAK TO,

17:45.590 --> 17:46.659
SO I MADE AN APPOINTMENT FOR

17:46.660 --> 17:48.696
SEAN TO SEE HER ON FRIDAY.

17:48.700 --> 17:50.520
LOOK, I'M GONNA HEAD TO LUNCH.

17:50.530 --> 17:51.519
THANKS FOR LISTENING TO ME

17:51.530 --> 17:53.669
ABOUT MEGAN O'HARA, BUT,

17:53.670 --> 17:55.535
PLEASE, DON'T TELL HIM WE HAD

17:55.540 --> 17:57.462
THIS CONVERSATION.

17:57.470 --> 18:01.201
Christian: OF COURSE NOT.

18:01.210 --> 18:02.199
Sean: HOW DARE YOU TELL MY

18:02.210 --> 18:03.302
PARTNER THAT I'M HAVING AN

18:03.310 --> 18:04.743
AFFAIR WITH A PATIENT!

18:04.750 --> 18:06.206
Grace: I CAN'T BELIEVE I WAS SO

18:06.210 --> 18:08.349
STUPID AS TO THINK I COULD TRUST

18:08.350 --> 18:09.544
YOU WITH EVEN A MOMENT OF

18:09.550 --> 18:10.539
VU LN ERABILITY.

18:10.550 --> 18:11.539
YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE.

18:11.550 --> 18:12.539
Christian: AND YOU'RE AN

18:12.550 --> 18:13.756
ARROGANT LITTLE Ph.D. IN A PRADA

18:13.760 --> 18:14.886
KNOCKOFF SKIRT WHO SHOULDN'T BE

18:14.890 --> 18:16.619
SPREADING LIES ABOUT MY PARTNER

18:16.620 --> 18:18.485
OR ACCUSING ME OF BEING RUDE TO

18:18.490 --> 18:19.627
A CONSULT AND THEN TRYING TO

18:19.630 --> 18:21.495
BYPASS MY EXECUTIVE DECISIONS.

18:21.500 --> 18:22.489
Sean: WHO ELSE DID YOU UNLOAD

18:22.500 --> 18:23.865
ON, DR. SANTIAGO?

18:23.870 --> 18:25.792
THE NURSES? THE JANITOR?!

18:25.800 --> 18:26.926
IF I DISCOVER YOU WEAKENED THE

18:26.930 --> 18:28.192
MORALE OF THIS OFFICE WITH YOUR

18:28.200 --> 18:29.667
UNFOUNDED MALICIOUS GOSSIP--

18:29.670 --> 18:30.762
Grace: WHAT, SEAN? YOU'LL FIRE

18:30.770 --> 18:31.759
ME?

18:31.770 --> 18:32.759
ARE MY ACCUSATIONS THAT

18:32.770 --> 18:33.771
UNFOUNDED?

18:33.780 --> 18:34.769
Sean: YOU MIND YOUR OWN GODDAMN

18:34.780 --> 18:35.769
BUSINESS!

18:35.780 --> 18:36.769
Grace: THIS IS MY BUSINESS!

18:36.780 --> 18:38.543
THIS PATIENT IS MY BUSINESS!

18:38.550 --> 18:39.778
YOU HAVE PUT ME IN A DIFFICULT

18:39.780 --> 18:41.179
SITUATION, AND THIS IS NOT THE

18:41.180 --> 18:46.618
FIRST TIME YOU'VE DONE IT.

18:46.620 --> 18:48.656
Sean: LET'S TAKE A BREAK.

18:48.660 --> 18:49.752

18:55.530 --> 18:57.418
Sean: I'M NOT HAVING AN AFFAIR!

18:57.430 --> 18:58.522
Christian: I BELIEVE YOU, SEAN.

18:58.530 --> 18:59.519
Grace: I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

18:59.530 --> 19:00.531
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU BECAUSE I

19:00.540 --> 19:01.529
KNOW YOUR MARRIAGE IS IN

19:01.540 --> 19:02.529
TROUBLE.

19:02.540 --> 19:03.529
YOU TOLD ME THAT RIGHT BEFORE

19:03.540 --> 19:04.734
YOUR HAND CREPT UP MY THIGH

19:04.740 --> 19:08.870

19:09.880 --> 19:11.404

19:11.410 --> 19:13.640

19:13.650 --> 19:14.947
WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?

19:14.950 --> 19:16.247
Sean: THE DAY BEFORE I HIRED

19:16.250 --> 19:16.909
HER.

19:16.920 --> 19:17.841
Christian: AND DID YOU HIRE HER

19:17.850 --> 19:18.885
BECAUSE YOU WERE AFRAID SHE'D

19:18.890 --> 19:20.289
SUE?

19:20.290 --> 19:21.552
Grace: LAWSUITS USUALLY HAPPEN

19:21.560 --> 19:23.221
WHEN PEOPLE ARE FIRED AFTER

19:23.230 --> 19:24.424
THEY SLEEP WITH THE BOSS.

19:24.430 --> 19:25.419
Christian: IS THAT A THREAT?

19:25.430 --> 19:27.421
Sean: WAIT. YOU SLEPT WITH

19:27.430 --> 19:31.298
GRACE?

19:31.300 --> 19:32.426
Grace: IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

19:32.430 --> 19:33.431
Sean: GOD DAMN IT, ARE YOU OUT

19:33.440 --> 19:34.429

19:34.440 --> 19:35.429

19:38.670 --> 19:43.607

19:47.750 --> 19:52.585
Sean: JUST FOR TODAY.

19:52.590 --> 19:53.579
Christian: I DON'T WANT HER

19:53.590 --> 19:54.955
HERE, SEAN.

19:54.960 --> 19:55.949
SHE'S A TROUBLEMAKER, AND HER

19:55.960 --> 19:56.949
SHOES ARE CHEAP.

19:56.960 --> 19:57.984
Sean: SHUT UP, CHRISTIAN.

19:57.990 --> 20:00.823
SHUT UP AND LET ME THINK.

20:00.830 --> 20:02.388
IF JULIA EVEN SUSPECTED FOR A

20:02.400 --> 20:03.799
SECOND I WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR,

20:03.800 --> 20:04.789
THAT WOULD BE IT.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.028
SHE'D FILE FOR DIVORCE, SHE'D

20:06.030 --> 20:07.588
TAKE THE KIDS AWAY FROM ME.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.534
I CAN'T RISK THAT.

20:09.540 --> 20:11.428
THAT'S WHY I WOULD NEVER HAVE

20:11.440 --> 20:16.400
AN AFFAIR.

20:16.410 --> 20:17.399
Christian: GIVE MEGAN O'HARA

20:17.410 --> 20:18.968

20:18.980 --> 20:21.346

20:21.350 --> 20:23.511
Sean: I CAN'T DO THAT NOW, AFTER

20:23.520 --> 20:25.010
GRACE'S RIDICULOUS ACCUSATION.

20:25.020 --> 20:26.009
Christian: IT WOULD LOOK

20:26.020 --> 20:27.009
SUSPICIOUS IF YOU DIDN'T DO THE

20:27.020 --> 20:28.009
OPERATION.

20:28.020 --> 20:29.487
GRACE IS OBVIOUSLY DELUDED,

20:29.490 --> 20:31.629
ABOUT YOU, ABOUT ME.

20:39.030 --> 20:40.019

20:40.030 --> 20:41.668
MORE PRO BONO WORK.

20:41.670 --> 20:42.659
Sean: WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?

20:42.670 --> 20:43.659
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW

20:43.670 --> 20:45.638
THIS GIRL?

20:45.640 --> 20:46.766
Matt: I KNOW HER.

20:46.770 --> 20:48.579
I DON'T KNOW HER WELL.

20:52.580 --> 20:53.569
Matt: I VISITED HER IN THE

20:53.580 --> 20:56.845
HOSPITAL.

20:56.850 --> 20:58.078
THAT STORY YOU READ REALLY GOT

20:58.090 --> 21:01.582
TO ME.

21:01.590 --> 21:06.380
SOMEBODY RUINED HER LIFE, DAD.

21:06.390 --> 21:07.755
HER MOTHER'S THIS FANATICAL

21:07.760 --> 21:08.920
RELIGIOUS PERSON WHO DOESN'T

21:08.930 --> 21:09.919
BELIEVE IN MEDICINE.

21:09.930 --> 21:11.090
Sean: MATT, THE LINE THAT

21:11.100 --> 21:12.624
DIVIDES CHURCH AND STATE

21:12.630 --> 21:13.790
SOMETIMES ALSO APPLIES TO

21:13.800 --> 21:15.392
MEDICINE AND THE PATIENT.

21:15.400 --> 21:16.799
YOU AND I MIGHT NOT AGREE WITH

21:16.800 --> 21:17.801
HER MOTHER'S BELIEFS--

21:17.810 --> 21:18.959
Matt: NO. WHEN THE BANDAGES COME

21:18.970 --> 21:20.506
OFF, SHE IS GONNA LOOK LIKE A

21:20.510 --> 21:25.800
MONSTER.

21:25.810 --> 21:28.608
I CAN'T HELP HER.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.941

22:12.130 --> 22:13.119
THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO STOOD

22:13.130 --> 22:14.119

22:14.130 --> 22:15.688

22:15.700 --> 22:17.497
I WANT MY ACCUSERS TO KNOW THEY

22:17.500 --> 22:19.889
ARE FORGIVEN, NOT JUST BY ME,

22:19.900 --> 22:22.437
BUT BY GOD.

22:22.440 --> 22:23.464
AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR ALL OF US

22:23.470 --> 22:24.732
TO PUT THIS BEHIND US AND TO

22:30.610 --> 22:32.475

22:32.480 --> 22:33.469
THEY ARE THE MOST IN NEED OF

24:00.970 --> 24:02.995
2 HOURS MAX.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.730
SHE'S BEEN UNDER FOR 3 HOURS.

24:05.740 --> 24:06.729
WE SHOULD CLOSE.

24:06.740 --> 24:07.775
DOES THE INFRA-MAMMARY FALL TOO

24:07.780 --> 24:09.736

24:09.740 --> 24:10.741
IT'S TOO LOW.

24:10.750 --> 24:11.739
I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE HIGHER.

24:11.750 --> 24:12.876

24:12.880 --> 24:13.869
Nurse: WHY?

24:13.880 --> 24:14.869

24:14.880 --> 24:16.677
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

24:23.660 --> 24:25.878

24:25.890 --> 24:26.879
ARE YOU SURE IT WAS HIM ON THE

24:41.640 --> 24:42.629
WE HAVE TURNED AWAY FROM YOUR

WHEN A MAN COMMITS ANY WRONG

24:44.780 --> 24:45.769
TOWARD A FELLOW MAN, THUS

24:45.780 --> 24:46.804

24:50.320 --> 24:51.309
YOU THINK THEY SERVE KOSHER FOOD

24:51.320 --> 24:52.309

24:52.320 --> 24:53.309
Henry: JAIL? W-WHY--WHY WOULD

24:53.320 --> 24:54.309
WE GO TO JAIL IF WE TURN

24:54.320 --> 24:55.309
OURSELVES IN?

24:55.320 --> 24:56.309
Matt: WE HAD MARIJUANA IN THE

24:58.330 --> 24:59.319
THAT.

24:59.330 --> 25:03.994
Matt: THEY'LL FIGURE IT OUT!

25:04.000 --> 25:06.161
WE DIDN'T KILL HER.

25:06.170 --> 25:07.262
THIS COULD ALL GO AWAY IF WE

25:07.270 --> 25:09.795

25:19.350 --> 25:20.817

25:42.840 --> 25:43.829
DON'T TRUST US WITH THEIR

25:48.940 --> 25:50.805

25:50.810 --> 25:51.947
IF A POLICE RECORD KEEPS YOU OUT

25:51.950 --> 25:52.939

26:23.140 --> 26:25.847

39:43.540 --> 39:46.873
I'VE DRANK.

39:46.880 --> 39:49.212
I'VE DONE DRUGS.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.176
I'VE FORNICATED WITH WOMEN AND

39:51.180 --> 39:54.718
DISCARDED THEM LIKE TRASH.

39:54.720 --> 39:56.950
I'VE LOST MY SOUL.

40:00.160 --> 40:04.028
THE BOYS YOU RAPED WILL BE

40:04.030 --> 40:04.962
SAYING THE SAME THING IN 20

40:04.970 --> 40:06.062
YEARS.

DID YOU KNOW THAT?

40:15.910 --> 40:17.639
Shannon: I KNOW THAT AS A PARENT

40:17.640 --> 40:19.904
OF ONE OF MY ACCUSERS, IT'S HARD

40:19.910 --> 40:21.241
TO LOOK AT YOUR OWN CHILD AND

40:21.250 --> 40:23.775
ACCEPT HIS LYING.

40:23.780 --> 40:25.816
CHILDREN MAKE UP STORIES.

40:25.820 --> 40:28.550
Christan: I'M NOT A PARENT.

40:28.560 --> 40:30.778
I'M YOUR PLASTIC SURGEON,

40:43.540 --> 40:44.905
Shannon: I'VE STOPPED.

40:44.910 --> 40:48.209
I WAS SICK, AND I'VE STOPPED.

40:48.210 --> 40:49.507
I HAVEN'T TOUCHED ANYONE IN 2

40:49.510 --> 40:50.499

40:50.510 --> 40:51.909
Christan: IS THIS A CONFESSION,

40:51.910 --> 40:53.275
FATHER?

Shannon: I'VE REPENTED IN MY OWN

40:55.220 --> 40:59.088
WAY.

40:59.090 --> 41:00.546
GOD DOESN'T JUDGE.

41:00.550 --> 41:01.687

41:01.690 --> 41:04.113
Christan: ARE YOU READY TO MAKE

41:04.120 --> 41:06.953
A CON FESSION, FATHER?

41:06.960 --> 41:08.222
Shannon: I HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT.

41:08.230 --> 41:09.697
I'VE DONE BETTER.

41:14.230 --> 41:16.266
WHEN DOES IT STOP?

41:16.270 --> 41:18.067
Christan: ARE YOU READY TO MAKE

41:18.070 --> 41:20.038
A CON FESSION, FATHER?

41:34.020 --> 41:35.009
Shannon: ARGHHH...

41:35.020 --> 41:37.250
Christan: MAKE YOUR CONFESSION.

41:37.260 --> 41:38.625
YOU CALL THE POLICE AND MAKE

41:38.630 --> 41:39.881
YOUR CONFESSION, OR I WILL LEAVE

41:39.890 --> 41:41.221

41:41.230 --> 41:44.688

41:44.700 --> 41:46.565
Shannon: I CAN'T.

41:46.570 --> 41:48.663
I'M AFRAID.

41:48.670 --> 41:49.659
IF I GO TO PRISON, THEY'LL KILL

41:49.670 --> 41:50.261
ME.

41:50.270 --> 41:51.567
Christan: DID YOU REALLY THINK

41:51.570 --> 41:52.867
YOU'D GET AWAY WITH IT?

41:52.870 --> 41:54.007
Shannon: THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY.

41:54.010 --> 41:56.638
AFTER ALL, AREN'T YOU IN THE

41:56.640 --> 41:59.609
BUSINESS OF LIES?

[SCREAMS]

42:02.750 --> 42:06.015

42:08.890 --> 42:12.758
BUT WHEN I SEE THE BOYS...

42:12.760 --> 42:14.250
I FEEL THINGS.

42:18.630 --> 42:23.761
OH...GOD!

42:23.770 --> 42:25.101
FORGIVE ME.

42:29.040 --> 42:30.837
I WANT THEM.

42:36.120 --> 42:38.918
Christan: I HAVE PICTURES.

42:38.920 --> 42:41.081
YOU WANT REDEMPTION?

42:41.090 --> 42:43.183
TURN YOURSELF IN.

42:43.190 --> 42:44.782
EITHER WAY, YOU'RE GOIN' TO

42:44.790 --> 42:45.779
JAIL.

42:45.790 --> 42:47.985
WHETHER YOU GO TO HELL IS UP TO

42:47.990 --> 42:48.593
YOU.

43:11.080 --> 43:12.286
Shannon: ALL RIGHT.

43:48.720 --> 43:49.948

43:49.960 --> 43:51.382
DONE?

43:51.390 --> 43:52.926
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

43:57.130 --> 43:59.826
Christan: I CAN'T DO IT, SEAN.

43:59.830 --> 44:01.263
Sean: YOU CAN'T DO WHAT?

44:01.270 --> 44:04.728
Christan: I'VE BEEN PRAYING...

44:04.740 --> 44:08.062
TO FORGIVE, BUT I CAN'T DO IT.

44:11.140 --> 44:12.175
Sean: THE AUTHORITIES WILL DEAL

44:12.180 --> 44:13.738
WITH HIM NOW.

44:13.750 --> 44:15.274
Christan: NOT HIM.

44:18.020 --> 44:19.942
ME.

44:26.760 --> 44:28.819
Sean: WHAT DID YOU DO?

44:36.170 --> 44:39.162
Christan: I LET HIM TOUCH ME.

44:39.170 --> 44:43.903
FOR YEARS, I LET HIM TOUCH ME.

44:43.910 --> 44:46.743
Sean: WHO?

44:46.750 --> 44:48.445
Christan: MR. TROY.

44:48.450 --> 44:51.749
YOUR FOSTER FATHER?

44:51.750 --> 44:53.149
HE'S DEAD, AND I THOUGHT

44:53.150 --> 44:54.185
THAT WOULD END IT,

44:54.190 --> 44:56.351
BUT IT DIDN'T.

45:00.190 --> 45:02.055
Sean: CHRISTIAN, YOU WERE JUST A

45:02.060 --> 45:05.928
BOY.

45:05.930 --> 45:09.229
IF HE ABUSED YOU...

45:09.240 --> 45:12.300
IT WAS HIS FAULT.

45:12.310 --> 45:16.929
HE HAD THE POWER.

45:16.940 --> 45:18.942
HE'S THE ONE.

45:21.210 --> 45:22.768
Christan: I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING

45:22.780 --> 45:25.988
WHEN HE TOOK ME IN.

45:25.990 --> 45:29.915
I WANTED TO BE...SOMEBODY.

45:35.960 --> 45:37.097
HE SAID HE'D GIVE ME MONEY

45:37.100 --> 45:42.367
IF I LET HIM TOUCH ME.

45:42.370 --> 45:43.894
AND I DID.

45:47.240 --> 45:48.969
I BOUGHT THINGS.

I SOLD MYSELF.

OH...

45:58.120 --> 46:00.384
OH, GOD...

46:00.390 --> 46:02.915
I SOLD MYSELF.
