Fly.

00:25.100 --> 00:27.000
Fly.

00:27.001 --> 00:33.308
You're beautiful, are you?
Yes, you are.

00:33.309 --> 00:34.308
That's my boy.

00:34.309 --> 00:41.308
Is that smile?
Is it?

00:41.309 --> 00:49.310
Oh, you're the most precious infant in the world.

01:18.300 --> 01:23.300
- Hauled it on the beach, walking by.
- Did you?

01:25.301 --> 01:27.802
- Yeah. Been many years in the family.
- How long have you had it?

01:27.803 --> 01:30.304
Since I was five.

01:30.305 --> 01:32.306
It's amazing.

01:32.307 --> 01:35.999
You're joking!

01:36.000 --> 01:45.308
In my land said, they do a beautiful dance - fertility dance. And they had babies.

02:01.309 --> 02:05.310
Here you go.
I was told to keep it warm.

02:05.311 --> 02:09.312
Well, we should have the results in a couple of weeks.

02:09.312 --> 02:16.314
Brilliant.

03:06.319 --> 03:11.320
Hi.

03:11.321 --> 03:12.322
Sorry, my husband is not here. He's...

03:12.323 --> 03:15.324
Trying to rebuild this, eh?

03:15.325 --> 03:22.326
Are you one of his students?

03:34.327 --> 03:35.337
Think I have the right look, eh?

03:35.338 --> 03:39.337
- Oh, you're Nick! Hi.
_ So I exist.

03:39.338 --> 03:43.699
Yeah, I know, of course. I just wasn't expecting you, I'm Dawn.

03:43.700 --> 03:45.899
Just hought I'd drop by.

03:45.900 --> 03:48.899
I will let him know.

03:48.900 --> 03:49.989
Hey, let's make it a surprise.

03:49.990 --> 03:52.937
Oh no, I think I should.

03:52.938 --> 03:55.937
Oh, go on then.

03:55.938 --> 04:01.338
Thanks.

04:05.948 --> 04:11.848
Oh. No, he's gone into a class. Do you want to...bring your stuff in? Come in.

04:27.858 --> 04:32.767
- It's a bit of a bomb site.
- I feel like I'm home

04:32.768 --> 04:39.299
I'll take down my things, shall I?

04:39.300 --> 04:43.667
We had no idea you were coming.

04:43.668 --> 04:52.368
We're not really set up for guests yet.

05:07.300 --> 05:10.567
Oh, don't bring her too close to a hen hatch. She's not trained yet.

05:10.568 --> 05:14.467
She's a reject dog. She was abandoned by her owners.

05:14.468 --> 05:17.467
Reject...

05:17.468 --> 05:24.000
You wanna put up some darn there.

05:24.468 --> 05:30.368
Hi!

05:31.868 --> 05:38.368
Bloody fucking hell.

05:49.168 --> 05:51.367
Been on a sunbed, then?

05:51.368 --> 05:53.567
I tried to call.

05:53.568 --> 05:57.868
- How the fuck did you know I'd be here?
- Dog returns to its shit.

06:00.268 --> 06:06.267
He's not very refined.

06:06.268 --> 06:08.467
So what do you think?

06:08.468 --> 06:12.367
- It's lovely.
- Yeah.
- It's lovely.

06:12.368 --> 06:18.467
- It'll be beautiful.
- Beautiful, yeah.

06:18.468 --> 06:24.868
Got all you want then?

06:50.768 --> 06:57.368
This is from my family.

07:26.268 --> 07:30.367
It must be hard out there.

07:30.368 --> 07:37.368
You must miss home.

07:40.768 --> 07:42.667
Oh, fuck those glasses.

07:42.668 --> 07:48.267
I know they're here somewhere. We haven't really had the time to...

07:48.268 --> 07:52.368
- Shame I was away.
- It was kind of low-key.

07:51.368 --> 07:55.767
- It was only a register office.
- How did he behave?

07:55.768 --> 08:00.268
- Oh well. He wasn't found shagging one of my braidmaids in the toilet, were you?
- Get back to the chopping, missus.

08:00.768 --> 08:03.767
- She's changed you.
- Huh?
- You got all posh.

08:03.768 --> 08:09.368
- Marriage is a constant process of negotiation.
- Yeah. We're signing our chains.

08:11.668 --> 08:16.368
- How's Sam?
- Grand. She's-she's grand.

08:16.668 --> 08:22.368
- And the kid?
- Dylan? Yeah, he - he's a bundle of fun.

08:23.468 --> 08:25.567
Not mine; by previous.

08:25.568 --> 08:29.868
- God, how do they cope with all the coming and going?
- They don't.

08:35.668 --> 08:38.567
Thank you.

08:38.568 --> 08:44.567
- Well, cheers.
- Cheers.

08:44.568 --> 08:49.268
- So you didn't buy the farm, then?
- Ah, it's a wreck.

09:28.568 --> 09:34.768
- Tell me.
- Your brother is a joke, huh? Why haven't we seen him?

09:34.968 --> 09:41.567
- He's been in the army.
- And?

09:41.568 --> 09:49.168
- He pushed our Mum down the stairs when he was a teenager.
- Oh my God. Why?

09:50.668 --> 09:57.868
- Well, she could be a bit... a bit verbal.
- Still.

10:01.568 --> 10:08.768
I burned my Mum with the curling tongs when I was sixteen.
And it wasn't entirely an accident.

10:08.868 --> 10:12.467
She took me to a psychiatrist.

10:12.468 --> 10:20.868
Yeah, well. Our Mum ended up it the hospital.

11:09.468 --> 11:15.268
David!

11:40.668 --> 11:47.567
- You hungry?
- I'm starving, just don't know what...
- Yeah?

11:47.568 --> 11:53.000
- Eggs. Orange. Something to...
- All right, then.

11:54.568 --> 12:03.168
You wanna take that back to bed, yeah?

12:30.568 --> 12:36.368
What?

13:11.368 --> 13:16.000
- I want a baby.
- Be patient.

13:27.568 --> 13:30.867
- What's this all about?

13:30.868 --> 13:35.267
- You buggered it in you sleep.
- You were sleepwalking.

13:35.268 --> 13:40.550
- Oh shit. Shit, I haven't done that for a while.
- What, buggering lettuce?

13:41.468 --> 13:42.999
Oh, thanks.

13:43.000 --> 13:48.000
- Maybe it's because you haven't be able to relax.
- Maybe. I don't feel relaxed.
- Yeah, don't relax too much.

13:50.468 --> 14:00.450
- When we were little, David and his mates - they made me a little obstacle course.
- How do you know? You were asleep! Dawn, what you have to do is talk really quietly...
- ...so I sleepwalked into the pond.

14:05.668 --> 14:08.267
Grab some breakfast.

14:08.268 --> 14:15.650
I'm all right here, thanks.

14:51.568 --> 14:55.667
- I don't know whether we should've gotten that grime...

14:55.668 --> 14:59.867
- Carefully we put a life in it.

14:59.868 --> 15:04.450
David! David! David! You...

15:04.868 --> 15:09.350
I can't believe you did that! It's not funny! It's not funny....

15:50.468 --> 15:57.350
- So how long is it since you've been back home?
- Well, about six years since I've been back in these parts.

16:01.368 --> 16:04.567
How come you and David haven't been in touch?

16:04.568 --> 16:13.550
Davy was making his way in London; and he got kind of lost, didn't he?

16:21.868 --> 16:27.900
Oh I love this sound. God. Fucking hell! Hello, mate!
-Fuck me!

16:28.168 --> 16:32.867
- Back from the dead, eh?
- I can fucking sort you out, mate, I'm bigger now.

16:32.868 --> 16:35.367
Now, you watch out for this one, Dawn.

16:35.368 --> 16:43.350
- So you look after it for Sharon's dad now?
- Married her. He's dead, thank Christ

16:45.568 --> 16:49.367
Don't tell her I told you that, eh, Dawn?

16:49.368 --> 16:54.767
- You want one of them?
- No, I'm good, thanks.

16:54.768 --> 16:57.567
Thank you.

16:57.568 --> 17:01.667
Here you go. Thanks. All right, Miss Grate?

17:01.668 --> 17:04.666
These are for you.

17:04.667 --> 17:08.849
What? It's not bad. I'll tell you about being bad.

17:08.968 --> 17:17.250
Number two, The Hastings. Cathy Histen hang herself;
nobody found her for a week'cause nobody gave a fuck about Cathy Histen.

17:18.568 --> 17:27.849
Number 3, The Hastings. Jacky Gross - beat his wife for twenty years.
But he wasn't a bad boy because he did all the football scores on the radio
when he was driving buses.

17:28.568 --> 17:32.667
Oh goody, old Forge! That's come up in a world.

17:32.668 --> 17:37.550
They used to have all cobwebby windows and have,
like, a horses hoof, right down there.

17:39.668 --> 17:45.567
He was having sex with his daughter. He was.
Everybody knew about it.

17:45.568 --> 17:49.650
Homely. Haha,Homely.

17:49.868 --> 17:56.750
She had three kids and she drawn herself and the two of them in the quarry pond.
Don't know what happened to third, poor little sod.

18:04.768 --> 18:09.250
- I met an evil spirit in this church, aye, when I was seven.
- You did not.
- I did.

18:09.768 --> 18:15.567
Made me what I am. That and the army.

18:15.568 --> 18:22.350
That will ward them off - the spirits.
Sweet to the sweet.

18:22.568 --> 18:23.767
Go on.

18:23.768 --> 18:29.550
Have a good day.

18:32.668 --> 18:41.650
We all know the first line, OK? So when I count to one, two, three,
I want you all to come in together.
I want the front line and the back line to come in together, OK?

18:45.768 --> 18:51.650
Tell me.

18:55.768 --> 19:03.050
He's so full-on, he's funny.

19:03.768 --> 19:07.767
You tell me.

19:07.768 --> 19:11.767
- One of my students is cutting herself.
- How do you know?

19:11.768 --> 19:17.450
She told me. This is a shame, she's a bright kid.

19:19.668 --> 19:26.150
- You have to report it.
- I don't want to get her into trouble. With her family I mean.

19:26.568 --> 19:33.150
- You have to tell someone, David, it's a law.
- Yeah. Social services. Bit of a mixed bag.

19:36.368 --> 19:42.350
She trusts me.

20:00.568 --> 20:05.550
- I can't believe he hasn't brought you here.
- We did pass by once. When did David leave?

20:05.768 --> 20:09.867
- When he was seventeen.  God, it's a wreck.
- So which one was yours?

20:09.868 --> 20:17.250
The one just around the front.

20:17.768 --> 20:24.450
- How often have you dreamt about it?
- I've dreamt about it, all right. Watch out.

20:25.768 --> 20:30.000
I left some old tobacco just here.

20:31.568 --> 20:38.667
- Just look at that, oh my God, it's been there since I was fifteen.
- Aw, you can tell.

20:38.668 --> 20:46.450
- So what was it like, you and David down the farm?
- Mixed bag.

20:49.668 --> 20:56.550
My grandpa, he had these big shire horses, they were fucking huge!
But really gentle. Yeah.

21:02.268 --> 21:12.550
- Yeah. Thanks for...um....for looking after us. Appreciate it. Obliged.
- No worries.

21:39.568 --> 21:45.650
- Hey, stranger!
- Wow! Fancy that! How are you doing?

21:45.768 --> 21:50.450
- Hey, Dawn.
- Hi! You okay?
- Yeah. Hi, Miss Hedges!

21:51.368 --> 21:55.450
- Say, you won any medals yet?
- Yeah, the Purple Heart.

21:55.768 --> 22:01.550
I just gotta....

22:02.768 --> 22:08.450
- They spit in the food.
- I'm sure they don't.
- You'll see.

22:09.768 --> 22:17.450
- So how were they? When you were teaching them. The Johnson boys!
- Flamey brats.

22:18.568 --> 22:27.450
Poor little chaps. Sometimes you can't help them even if you want to.

22:28.468 --> 22:37.450
Their father beat them. Flack-fleck-giddley-geck.
Not that you could see anything.

22:40.568 --> 22:49.150
- David never told me.
- Where is he? I like clever boys!

23:13.368 --> 23:18.350
- But you have been torturing her.
- What?! I - she used to torture us!

23:18.568 --> 23:21.667
- Poor old pretty, she hasn't got any kids to look after her.
- Oh that's what kids are for!

23:21.668 --> 23:24.767
- Remember Mister Dixon?
- Sure!

23:24.768 --> 23:30.150
- He used to beat the crap out of us - well,the lads, that is.
- Of you, you mean.
- Yeah, because I took it up for Davy.

23:30.568 --> 23:33.767
- Oh, come on.
- What did you do to him?

23:33.768 --> 23:39.450
He was just always the one there when everyone else turned and run;
it was always him standing like: "What?! It wasn't me! It wasn't me! I didn't do it!"

23:39.768 --> 23:41.667
'Till he sent you away.

23:41.668 --> 23:45.750
He had his pale impostor.

23:46.768 --> 23:50.767
- Ten years ago, Dawn.
- Oh, give or take.

23:50.768 --> 23:55.450
Far from the prying eyes of the state.
Banged his head against the wall.

23:55.768 --> 23:58.767
Yeah, that's why I work looking after the troubled kids.

23:58.768 --> 24:05.750
That's why I joined the fucking army.

24:08.468 --> 24:17.450
- Hey, remember that time you held my head in the water trough? I tell you, I almost choked.
- No!
- Yeah.

24:18.768 --> 24:21.767
- Where was David?
- I remember that.
- I don't know, elsewhere.

24:21.768 --> 24:23.767
You nicked my girlfriend.

24:23.768 --> 24:28.650
- I? Nicked your girlfriend - I was thirteen, how could I nick your girlfriend?!
- You looked at her.

24:32.768 --> 24:41.450
- That day, I was dancing around my handbag, and someone all scrawny, little scruffy...
- Me?
- Feller comes up to me. Aye, you - Nick -

24:42.768 --> 24:50.450
...starts giving it the big-in coming on and the Mister Trustworthy here,
older lad, comes up and saves me.

24:52.768 --> 24:54.767
You know they forced me to do that?

24:54.768 --> 25:01.567
You Johnson boys! Oh, demand and the struggle.

25:01.568 --> 25:03.999
Yeah, well, that's all over now.

25:04.000 --> 25:09.450
Marriage is just so restful, isn't it, Dawn?
You don't have to choose anymore.

25:10.768 --> 25:15.450
- Hello.
- Well, if you didn't laugh, you'd cry, eh?

25:16.268 --> 25:22.250
Miss Hedges told me about your dad. That he beat you.

25:22.468 --> 25:26.767
Who is that, Dad? He used to fuck us up the ass, eh?

25:26.768 --> 25:28.767
He's too much.

25:28.768 --> 25:30.999
- Well, you wanted him to stay.
- Did I?!

25:31.000 --> 25:38.450
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Listen, not here, Dawn. All right,mate, can I have one more gin and tonic, please?

25:41.268 --> 25:46.850
- Oh God!
- Shhh, come in.

25:50.000 --> 25:55.450
- What are you doing?
- Come on!
- You go on!
- No, I can't, cause Gary won't have that.

25:58.768 --> 26:02.767
Blimey, love!

26:02.768 --> 26:07.467
Here.

26:07.468 --> 26:15.450
Be careful, don't rip it.

26:18.568 --> 26:23.767
Lent me this, Davy boy!

26:23.768 --> 26:27.467
Come on, guys, move out of the way.

26:27.468 --> 26:39.450
...Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bide.
But come you back when summer's in the meadow...
- Shoking!

26:39.768 --> 26:46.450
...Or all the valley's hushed and white with snow...

26:46.868 --> 26:53.450
...And be up here in sunshine or in shadow...
- Wah-wah!

26:53.768 --> 27:01.450
...Oh Davy boy, oh Davy boy, I love you so.

27:05.568 --> 27:11.450
Hateful!

27:28.768 --> 27:32.767
- Dave, I hear someone in there.
- Hmm?

27:32.768 --> 27:35.367
Think there's someone in there.

27:35.368 --> 27:42.450
- There is! There is, David, look! Look!
- All right, all right.
- David, somebody in here! There's somebody in there, Dave, look!

27:44.768 --> 27:48.567
Nick?

27:48.568 --> 27:54.450
- It's over, mate, I was in there! When....when he got out of tank, he was all on fire, Dave! He was burning!!!
- Nick?

27:54.878 --> 28:09.000
I pulled him away, I tried to save him, I was saying: Where's the fire brigade? Where are they?
But it was... there was nobody there! I tried to put it down, I jumped on top of him, like that.
But it went through, I couldn't save him!

28:09.368 --> 28:10.767
- You all right.
- Look!

28:10.768 --> 28:19.650
- Look at me, look....
- Look, no!
- It's all right. It's all right-look at me.

28:49.768 --> 28:58.450
Don't. I've done enough.

29:00.768 --> 29:03.767
Is he all right?

29:03.768 --> 29:10.000
Poor Nick.

29:16.768 --> 29:20.567
Why didn't you tell me about your dad?

29:20.568 --> 29:32.450
Because I don't want to think about it.
Because.... because he was full of hate, self hate. Because I hate him.

29:35.868 --> 29:47.450
- Why did we come here?
- Because I wanna do some good in the place that my dad was a tosser.

29:47.768 --> 29:49.999
- Do you really like the country side?
- You are the one with the chickens.

29:50.000 --> 29:53.567
- David....
- I love you.

29:53.568 --> 29:56.767
Why has he come back?

29:56.768 --> 30:04.550
- I used to hold him. That's all, I mean, you saw!
- Hold me like that.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.999
He needs help.

30:36.000 --> 30:40.250
You can't help Nick; can't save him.

30:53.168 --> 30:59.550
Hello?

31:01.268 --> 31:10.550
Nick. Have you thought about talking to someone? You know - about your experiences.

31:11.068 --> 31:17.150
- We think you need professional help.
- We?!

31:17.368 --> 31:34.150
- There's no shame in going off on one, you know; I can talk to someone. We all need help.
- You may do.

31:32.000 --> 31:54.250
And you.

31:43.668 --> 31:54.550
...I opened the door and I was suddenly in the ruined city;
it looked as it....as it... was bombed.
The ground was hot ash with dead bodys scattered everywhere...

31:54.468 --> 32:05.150
Take a break, have a look at it; if it's one body, is this  a "body" without the "S"?
And if it's plural, you put "ies" in  there, now that makes "the bodies";
but that's brilliant, you've done that really, really well. Try to read down from there.

32:06.000 --> 32:10.150
...The building... the buildings were all smashed to pieces....

32:26.768 --> 32:33.467
So what do you know about professional help?

32:33.468 --> 32:40.750
I was mugged, in London. David went in, that's how we met. I had some counselling after that.

32:42.768 --> 32:49.550
- Oh. Well, he likes a barney.
- Really?
- I have not seen him fight except that one time.

32:55.268 --> 33:01.550
- What was it like? Really?
- Better than sex.

33:06.268 --> 33:26.550
Um...it's....um....it's like there's one of me out there, fighting
and one of me here, um....and I can't ....quite...make the two of them to....um....

33:28.568 --> 33:35.550
I know

33:36.768 --> 33:42.767
I can't have one record, see, that's.... that's the trouble.

33:42.768 --> 33:51.550
-Should I get the bowl?
- Yeah. And put some towel on that.

34:07.768 --> 34:12.550
OK. Can we just do guys, 'course the beginning... actually I just wanna hear them first of all.

34:49.568 --> 34:52.766
- Dawn! All right?
- Yeah.

34:52.768 --> 35:00.550
- You walking?
- Yeah!

35:01.468 --> 35:06.550
- So how you finding it?
- Well...it's a big old church.

35:06.768 --> 35:09.567
- It's beautiful.
- It is.

35:09.568 --> 35:15.267
- Those angels are famous.
- Really?
- Yeah.

35:15.268 --> 35:17.767
Churches make me feel sad somehow.

35:17.768 --> 35:25.550
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.
- Why?

36:12.268 --> 36:16.550
....Wait for me to come and save you, do you remember?!

36:18.368 --> 36:29.550
- You've frightened me earlier.
- Sorry. He gets to me sometimes.

36:37.168 --> 36:44.467
I hardly know you, do I?

36:44.468 --> 36:47.267
- We're trying for a baby.
- Nice.

36:47.268 --> 36:53.550
- Yeah well, it's taking it's sweet time.
- Nick one. I'll do it for you.

36:55.368 --> 37:00.350
- I was stolen, well - adopted.
- Really?

37:01.268 --> 37:05.467
Well that worked out well, as far as I can see.

37:05.468 --> 37:13.550
They're dead now. They were older. I miss them. Like you never really...

37:22.768 --> 37:31.550
I had to shut up; my mistake. In the bar. I couldn't see.

37:32.768 --> 37:41.550
- David!
- How did you know we were here?

37:41.768 --> 37:50.550
- You've seen enough?
- It's a wreck, innit?

38:35.568 --> 38:45.000
- Nick. Nick. Nick! It's all right. It's all right, it's all right, it's all right. It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right.
- Nick!

38:45.768 --> 38:52.000
It's all right, it's all right, Nick.

39:24.368 --> 39:27.367
What's happened?

39:27.368 --> 39:31.550
That was wide open. He must've left it open in his sleep.

39:33.468 --> 39:38.467
You did that!

39:38.468 --> 39:40.767
Why would I open the hen hatch?

39:40.768 --> 39:47.350
This is just like when you killed your rabbit!
He left the hatch opened in the middle of the night, let the dogs out, all in his sleep, when he was a kid!

39:47.768 --> 39:52.550
- You did that, you opened the hatch door and you blamed it on me, you killed it!
- You bed-wetter!

39:54.168 --> 40:00.267
- You little shit!
- Stop it!

40:00.268 --> 40:11.250
Dawn. Dawn. Dawn! Dawn!!! Dawn!!!

40:46.268 --> 40:48.767
You Johnson boys.

40:48.768 --> 40:55.550
...Come on, Judy!...
- Bring them here.

41:10.468 --> 41:13.167
Should we get rid of him?

41:13.168 --> 41:17.550
- Where to?
- He's got mates. What about his ex?

41:27.668 --> 41:34.150
David...Did you let the dog into the hen hatch?

41:35.268 --> 41:43.150
Sorry. I was only joking.

41:52.768 --> 41:59.550
Can you stand, please?

42:43.000 --> 42:49.267
You awake now?!!

42:49.268 --> 42:54.550
- Dave, I'm sorry. Dave! I'm sorry.Dave!
- Don't.
- Dave!

42:56.268 --> 43:07.550
Don't! Get up. Get up!
You want it, do you? Do you? You want it!

43:23.668 --> 43:30.550
I'll pay for that.

43:36.268 --> 43:44.000
Why did you leave me that house?

43:53.568 --> 44:00.150
Sorry about last night.

44:31.268 --> 44:36.550
- That looks good. You mind if I have a slice of that?
- You made it, you cut it.

44:37.268 --> 44:45.350
- Who wears the trousers in that house?
- She does.

44:50.268 --> 44:56.550
- Hey, do you think we should go away in the end of term?
- Yeah, we could.

44:58.168 --> 45:02.550
We got a house in Spain. Come there to us.

45:02.768 --> 45:08.467
- It's an idea.
- I'll come to Spain.

45:08.468 --> 45:17.550
Yeah, it's a shame you're leaving, Nick. We'll have farewell party on Saturday.
I'm gonna lauch it in the house. We'll have got a hell of the barbecue.

45:18.268 --> 45:25.550
- Oh. Gonna miss you, Nick.
- Know when your time's up.

45:42.268 --> 45:55.350
Yeah, Gary wants another kid. I just feel too young and I love all that, you know,
having a laugh and just be able to have drink. Yeah 'cause my Mum's not gonna be around forever.

45:55.468 --> 46:05.550
And she can handle one, but having....to have two, I don't know.
And I don't want my tits sagging to the ground.

46:05.868 --> 46:09.467
- Oh and here's the biggest one of them all.
- Biggest one of whom all, who's that?

46:09.468 --> 46:17.350
- Kids!
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah, you.

47:41.268 --> 47:46.550
Going to battle. With bloody flak jacket.

47:54.268 --> 47:58.550
- I wish you were coming to hear me.
- Sod's law.

48:00.768 --> 48:05.767
No.

48:05.768 --> 48:08.467
- No!
- Bit funeral, huh?
- Yeah.

48:08.468 --> 48:14.250
- What about this one?
- No!
- Dazzler, Bobbie dazzler.
- No, none of them. You're lovely as you are.

49:38.268 --> 49:39.867
Where was Sharon tonight?

49:39.868 --> 49:46.550
- Not her thing. David?
- PTA.

49:48.768 --> 49:59.550
- Thank you. Oh, sorry.
- It's all right. OK?

50:02.668 --> 50:07.667
- No!
- Stupid. Sorry.

50:07.668 --> 50:13.550
- It's all right. Thanks for walking me home.
- Dawn!

50:33.468 --> 50:41.550
...some food, eh? I think we need a wash, don't you, eh? I think you need a wash, don't you?...

50:41.868 --> 50:46.550
It's a hard thing being a teacher but it's ever harder being pupil.

50:54.868 --> 51:01.550
- It's not  a closed book by any means.
In the first instance, you need to come back here for a second test to make sure it isn't just a blip.
- It's not a blip.

51:02.468 --> 51:05.467
I'm sorry?

51:05.468 --> 51:20.550
It's a... it's... it's not a blip, um... I... I had a previous girlfriend who was...trying for a baby and....

51:45.468 --> 51:49.467
Stop crying.

51:49.468 --> 51:53.467
It's my fault, stop crying.

51:53.468 --> 51:55.667
Why didn't you just say?

51:55.668 --> 52:01.550
You kept pushing it, your little project, I mean, why couldn't we just waited for a couple of years?!

52:04.468 --> 52:08.967
- I was afraid it was me!
- Well it's me, you happy now?

52:08.968 --> 52:12.467
Christ!!!

52:12.468 --> 52:14.467
Could've guessed

52:14.468 --> 52:16.767
I'm gonna walk home.

52:16.768 --> 52:21.550
Dawn, please. Please don't leave me. I wouldn't be much without you, I...Ow!

53:42.868 --> 53:47.867
Hello?

53:47.868 --> 53:52.867
Dawn!

53:52.868 --> 53:54.999
Hello?

53:55.000 --> 54:02.550
It's Gary.

56:06.000 --> 56:12.550
Oh God. I'm so, so sorry!

56:28.868 --> 56:32.567
- I'll take the dog for a walk.
- Go on, then.

56:32.568 --> 56:37.550
Come on, Judy. Yeah and thanks for making the bed.

56:43.868 --> 56:51.550
Less of the chatter, please. Right. Make sure you get into a line.
Thomas, Ann, will you stop talking, please. Thank you.

56:51.868 --> 56:58.550
Nadir and Sinead, will you please be quiet! You've got to do this in a week and none of you prepared, OK?
So you should start paying attention.

57:47.468 --> 57:52.550
David. I want to get through this.

57:54.568 --> 57:59.550
- We can have everything, we have whole life.
- Yeah, but you really want the child.

58:00.468 --> 58:04.867
How do you know what I want?

58:04.868 --> 58:12.550
If it was years, then we should go to the doctor.You lied about how long we've been trying.

58:12.868 --> 58:19.550
You lied.

58:19.868 --> 58:22.867
Oh God, I'm so ashamed.

58:22.868 --> 58:28.550
David, David...I love you.

58:30.868 --> 58:38.550
I want you to be happy.

59:11.868 --> 59:21.550
- David.
- You go. I don't wanna. You go, Dawn.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:05.000
I'm awake.

01:00:05.468 --> 01:00:13.450
I was just admiring....

01:00:18.668 --> 01:00:24.850
Nick.

01:00:54.468 --> 01:01:00.850
- Hi!
- Hi, how're you doing? Hello little one, how are you? Come here!

01:01:32.268 --> 01:01:35.867
She's sad, that's all. She can't have kids.

01:01:35.868 --> 01:01:42.667
- What?!
- Yeah. David told me.

01:01:42.668 --> 01:01:47.550
Ah, Dawn. Oh. I'm sorry.

01:01:52.668 --> 01:01:59.850
It's him who can't.

01:02:00.268 --> 01:02:09.550
- Oh, come on. I'm sorry, eh?
- It's all right.
- I'm sorry.

01:02:26.668 --> 01:02:34.850
Hello? I know, it's Sunday. We're trying to help you daughter, so...

01:02:36.668 --> 01:02:47.850
So you're leaving fourteen, going back? Say hello to the Taliban.
Blow bit few more talibs, eh?

01:02:49.268 --> 01:02:52.667
Here, catch.

01:02:52.668 --> 01:02:57.850
- Oh God!
- Is she allright?
- Come here, show me. Show me. Somebody get me some ice.

01:02:59.668 --> 01:03:04.667
- She allright?
- Yeah, she's fine.

01:03:04.668 --> 01:03:08.850
...A hot coal on me, David, you should get this fucking nut...

01:03:35.368 --> 01:03:42.550
- All right, Dawn? Need some help?
- Thank you.
- Who you gonna fuck next, then?

01:03:46.468 --> 01:03:50.550
- You all right, darling? Do you want some help?
- Yes please.

01:03:51.268 --> 01:04:01.250
David! David. Give us a ball. Watch this. Hey, soldier boy! Catch!

01:04:01.568 --> 01:04:08.667
He used to pay me to beat you up, did you know that?
What? What you can do?

01:04:08.668 --> 01:04:18.550
- Stop it!
- Remember when you did this to me, eh? Do you remember when you did this to me?!

01:04:19.468 --> 01:04:24.267
Baby, come here.

01:04:24.268 --> 01:04:29.567
I fucked your wife.

01:04:29.568 --> 01:04:34.250
- Gary! Gary,please.
- Get off me.

01:04:34.568 --> 01:04:44.550
- Don't look at me like that, Dawn. I'm the saint one! He pushed our Mum down stairs!
- Nicki.
- Fuck me!

01:04:45.268 --> 01:04:49.550
All the more, then. Gave her something to think about.

01:04:49.868 --> 01:04:55.550
David! David!!! No! David!!!

01:06:36.568 --> 01:06:45.550
Oh yeah, sure, we'll be in... that's fine, thank you.

01:06:51.568 --> 01:06:54.467
He's gone AWOL.

01:06:54.468 --> 01:06:58.367
- Did he tell you he was gonna run away?
- No.

01:06:58.368 --> 01:07:02.550
- Has he been in touch, David?
- No.

01:07:05.268 --> 01:07:19.550
- He dropped by this summer but we weren't that close since our parents died.
- Well. We....
- We think he might have mental health problems.

01:07:37.568 --> 01:07:46.267
- You think he will come back?
- How should I know?

01:07:46.268 --> 01:07:51.550
- You would tell me.
- He'll come to you.

01:07:56.368 --> 01:08:04.550
Why did you lie to me about him pushing your Mum down the stairs?

01:08:05.568 --> 01:08:12.550
She was hurting him. I was protecting him.

01:09:35.868 --> 01:09:41.550
Missed you. Yeah, I did, I missed you.

01:09:46.768 --> 01:09:54.550
No, don't go. Don't go, don't go.
Don't go, don't go. Please don't go.

01:09:55.268 --> 01:10:03.550
All right, I stink.
I went to London but I couldn't... hack it.

01:10:04.368 --> 01:10:16.550
Do you want a biscuit? Eh? Go on. Go on, have one.
They come from a back of the service station.

01:10:19.168 --> 01:10:32.550
I've let all my mates down. I just can't....sleep. I just can't.

01:10:34.568 --> 01:10:41.550
- How is Davy?
- I have to know...about you two.

01:10:42.368 --> 01:10:46.550
Well..he loves me.

01:10:53.368 --> 01:11:13.550
Dave looked after me, yeah?.. 'cause of Dad... but he, kind of.. owned me.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:27.550
- That's not love.
- He fucks you but he loves ME!
- He hates you!

01:11:30.368 --> 01:11:40.550
- You have to go. I'll bring you money.
- Where could I go?!
- If you love him, you'll leave us!

01:11:58.568 --> 01:12:02.867
- Where are you going?
- To choir.

01:12:02.868 --> 01:12:09.950
I'll drop you if you like.

01:13:01.468 --> 01:13:07.550
Nick?

01:14:27.168 --> 01:14:31.650
Where were you? I was worried about you.

01:14:31.868 --> 01:14:38.550
- Where is he? Where is he?
- Dawn?

01:14:59.368 --> 01:15:05.550
- She will need a good bed rest. We'll keep her for now.
- Thank you.

01:15:21.368 --> 01:15:28.550
Dawn... They say the baby is safe.

01:15:49.368 --> 01:15:56.767
I didn't want to hurt you.

01:15:56.768 --> 01:16:06.550
I want this child. I want you to be happy.

01:16:17.468 --> 01:16:28.550
- Nick came back. I saw him.
- I know. I know.

01:17:28.368 --> 01:17:34.367
- Hello!
- Hi!

01:17:34.368 --> 01:17:42.550
Is that little Ben? Hello, hello. Oh, he's lovely.

01:17:42.768 --> 01:17:47.550
- You must be proud.
- Yeah.
