that this is private.

every morning and read the whole paper

00:37.612 --> 00:39.679

00:39.781 --> 00:40.780

00:40.882 --> 00:43.049
I'd just grow some fucking weed.

Okay, turn around.

Um, I can't reach. I can't reach.

01:02.404 --> 01:04.203

01:10.178 --> 01:13.713
Thank you.

01:13.815 --> 01:15.882
How can I ever repay
you for saving my life?

01:17.652 --> 01:19.452
We... we've never been in the park.

01:19.554 --> 01:21.688
I mean... we would love a tour.

01:21.790 --> 01:23.223
- It's beautiful.
- Love. One love.

01:23.325 --> 01:25.291
Ooh, absolutely not.

Wait, what?

01:26.561 --> 01:28.995
We just saved your life.

01:29.097 --> 01:31.397
- That's how you worded it.
- You just said that.

01:31.432 --> 01:33.233
You have to have a key to come in.

01:33.335 --> 01:34.834
You have one.

And now that I have the day off,

02:40.435 --> 02:42.135

Again, I do not think
that's appropriate, Ilana.

03:52.941 --> 03:55.108
But he's my new boyfriend.

03:55.210 --> 03:56.976
I met him at the gym, he's a paramedic.

not a relationship type."

04:00.415 --> 04:02.615
"Uh, am I? 'Cause I'm in one now."

04:02.717 --> 04:04.817
I haven't had my ears
candled in a while,

04:04.920 --> 04:09.155
but it sounded to me like
he gave you multiples.

04:09.257 --> 04:11.457
Okay, were you listening to us have sex?

04:11.559 --> 04:14.427
Yeah. Just listening.

04:16.164 --> 04:18.998

04:19.100 --> 04:20.099

04:20.201 --> 04:22.135
But he is really good at sex.

04:22.237 --> 04:25.405
But I also think that's really about me

04:25.507 --> 04:27.173
knowing my body.

04:27.275 --> 04:28.608
Yeah, I've noticed that too

05:11.453 --> 05:12.785
I call 'em "ballerina feet."

05:12.887 --> 05:15.259
Just shave the sides off a
little and slap on some color.

10:53.622 --> 10:56.123
That's the one football game I watched.

10:56.225 --> 10:57.954
God, you're cute as shit.

10:57.989 --> 10:59.319
Oh, thanks.

10:59.354 --> 11:00.594
You wanna smash later?

11:00.696 --> 11:03.397
Um, uh, no.

11:03.499 --> 11:05.799
Thank you for the
polite invite, I guess.

11:05.901 --> 11:09.236
But I'm actually seeing someone.

11:09.338 --> 11:12.106
Waste of two minutes.

11:12.208 --> 11:13.741
You okay? You want me to cut a bitch?

11:13.843 --> 11:15.609
No, it's all right.

11:15.711 --> 11:17.678
But that's, like, the third
dude that's hit on me tonight.

11:17.780 --> 11:18.779
Mmm, not surprised.

11:18.881 --> 11:20.013
That's what happens when you're taken.

11:20.116 --> 11:24.084
Everybody can smell your pheromones
spraying off your mons pubis.

11:24.186 --> 11:28.722
Gotta make my day off count. Work
hard, play hard, baby. Hold up.

11:30.226 --> 11:31.529
Jesus, I'm getting there.

11:31.564 --> 11:32.926
Thanks very much.

11:33.028 --> 11:34.995
Ow! Jesus!

11:35.097 --> 11:36.029
I'm really sorry.

11:36.132 --> 11:38.532
It was just the tips.

11:38.634 --> 11:40.234
Ilana, those are dangerous.

11:40.336 --> 11:41.335
Oh, but they do come in handy.

11:45.007 --> 11:46.907
Mmm, thanks. Oh!

11:47.212 --> 11:49.395
_

11:50.880 --> 11:52.546
All right, the service
in here is terrible.

11:52.648 --> 11:54.072
Swear to God, train
service and cell service

11:54.107 --> 11:56.363
has been terrible since
we became a fascist state.

11:56.398 --> 11:58.452
You know what? I'm gonna see if
I can get service in another room.

11:58.554 --> 12:00.593
You know what? I'm gonna
work my death drops.

12:00.628 --> 12:01.835
Yes.

12:06.462 --> 12:10.097
Ah, that's great, okay.

12:19.875 --> 12:21.008
Jesus!

12:21.110 --> 12:23.510
No, I'm so sorry. I
just... I heard you crying.

12:23.612 --> 12:26.046
Uh, are you okay?

12:26.148 --> 12:29.950
Um...

12:31.787 --> 12:34.421
Yeah, I'm sorry.

12:34.523 --> 12:37.357
Sorry, I don't usually...
I just was getting service.

12:37.459 --> 12:39.726
I'm kind of having a tough time.

12:41.497 --> 12:44.031
Well, actually, my husband and I...

12:44.133 --> 12:45.766
are having a tough time.

12:45.868 --> 12:47.935
And I really...

12:48.037 --> 12:49.636
I really don't know what to do.

12:49.738 --> 12:52.039
Relationships are
tough, take it from me.

12:53.242 --> 12:54.975
How long have you guys been together?

12:55.077 --> 12:57.144
Show me just one. I'll show you both.

12:57.246 --> 12:58.745
- I'll show you right now...
- Ilana, what's good?

12:58.848 --> 12:59.980
- Damien!
- Hey, hey, what's up?

13:00.082 --> 13:01.248
How are you? Good to see you.

13:01.350 --> 13:02.550
- You too.
- Yeah.

13:02.552 --> 13:04.551
- What are you doing here?
- What're you talking about?

13:04.653 --> 13:06.787
It's my party. I invited you.

13:06.889 --> 13:08.522
- Yes.
- Yeah.

13:08.624 --> 13:09.790
- Right.
- Right, yeah.

13:09.892 --> 13:11.625
Wait, does that mean that

13:11.727 --> 13:14.061
Lincoln's here?

13:27.576 --> 13:28.842
Hold on one second.

13:28.944 --> 13:31.044
- I'm just gonna grab this.
- Okay.

13:31.146 --> 13:32.846
I'll come back for you.

13:32.948 --> 13:34.781
I shouldn't have invited her.

13:36.652 --> 13:38.919
- Well, hello.
- Hey.

13:39.021 --> 13:40.654
Ilana. Ilana Wexler.

13:40.756 --> 13:42.155
Yeah, I... I know.

13:42.258 --> 13:43.657
How are you? You look great.

13:43.759 --> 13:46.860
You look good too. You
look like a video girl.

13:46.962 --> 13:48.061
Woman.

13:48.163 --> 13:51.064
- Video gi... You look good.
- Thanks.

13:51.166 --> 13:52.232
Oh, hey.

13:53.402 --> 13:54.401
Steph, this is Ilana.

13:54.503 --> 13:56.570
Ilana, this is my girlfriend, Steph.

13:56.672 --> 13:59.840
Oh...

13:59.942 --> 14:00.974
No...

14:02.111 --> 14:04.311
♪ Oh, no, oh, no ♪

14:05.447 --> 14:06.947
♪ Oh, no... ♪

14:07.049 --> 14:08.715
Oh!

14:08.817 --> 14:10.484
Catch up with you later.

14:14.988 --> 14:17.722
Abbi, I just saw Lincoln
and then I met his girlfriend

14:17.825 --> 14:20.225
and I shit myself from
a sphincter-quivering,

14:20.327 --> 14:22.627
pelvic-floor-loosening,
socially lethal combination

14:22.729 --> 14:25.030
of cheese, champagne, and cocaine.

14:25.132 --> 14:27.999
I need some working fingers
in the bathroom pronto

14:28.102 --> 14:30.135
before I Edward Scissors-ass my ass.

14:30.237 --> 14:31.803
You owe me a doo doo favor, bitch!

14:36.477 --> 14:37.576
<i>Hey, this is Abbi.</i>

14:37.678 --> 14:40.011
<i>I'm sorry I can't answer the phone,
probably with my boyfriend, Mike.</i>

14:40.114 --> 14:41.780
<i>We're in a relationship.
We're probably...</i>

14:41.882 --> 14:43.248
Okay.

14:43.350 --> 14:46.017
Thanks for nothing.

14:47.921 --> 14:49.321
In use!

14:49.423 --> 14:51.823
Ilana, it's me.

14:53.127 --> 14:54.359
Oh, hey.

14:54.461 --> 14:56.027
Hey, did you shit your leotard?

14:56.130 --> 14:57.329
No.

15:04.938 --> 15:06.472
How'd you know?

15:06.507 --> 15:07.772
I know that face anywhere.

15:07.875 --> 15:10.075
That face is saying,
"I'm shitting my leotard."

15:10.177 --> 15:11.209
Mmm.

15:11.311 --> 15:13.211
Also, it really smells
like shit in here.

15:13.798 --> 15:14.913
It's just distinct.

15:15.015 --> 15:17.649
- That's a big... clue.
- It's just a smell.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.317
It smells how it's supposed to smell.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.386
Well, thank you so much.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.755
I do appreciate you checking in,

15:23.857 --> 15:27.826
but your services are
not, um, needed here.

15:27.928 --> 15:30.395
So thank you for, um...

15:30.497 --> 15:33.231
Ow.

15:39.072 --> 15:40.639
Yeah, I guess I could use a hand.

15:40.741 --> 15:43.241
Like I said, I'm open to
the idea of circumcision.

15:43.343 --> 15:44.648
- Okay.
- You know, Damien,

15:44.683 --> 15:47.445
I just love the full
sensitivity to my penis.

15:47.548 --> 15:49.080
- Of course.
- An orgasm for me

15:49.183 --> 15:51.483
is like a full-body
experience, you know?

15:51.585 --> 15:52.484
- Really?
- Yeah!

15:52.586 --> 15:55.020
It's like my body fills up with fire
and then I just jump into a glacier...

15:55.122 --> 15:56.655
that's broken up just for me.

15:56.757 --> 15:59.191
That's how a normal
orgasm feels for you?

15:59.293 --> 16:00.392
So sorry.

16:00.494 --> 16:02.060
Maybe there is a language barrier.

16:02.162 --> 16:03.328
Silly Jaimé!

16:03.430 --> 16:05.130
It's like the world
crumbles beneath my feet

16:05.232 --> 16:07.399
and when I open my eyes
the universe is reborn.

16:07.501 --> 16:08.466
You know what I mean?

16:08.569 --> 16:09.935
- Kinda.
- Yeah?

16:10.037 --> 16:11.469
Yeah. Uh...

16:11.572 --> 16:13.672
When I orgasm it's... It's kinda like...

16:13.774 --> 16:17.776
Okay, you know the
little basketball hoops

16:17.878 --> 16:19.919
that are in the kiddie
pool for the kids?

16:19.954 --> 16:21.980
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so I'm dunking on it.

16:22.082 --> 16:24.883
Pow! Slam dunk! Wet.

16:24.985 --> 16:26.585
And it feels great.

16:29.790 --> 16:31.756
I mean, we started going out in college.

16:31.858 --> 16:35.126
And we just started going in
different directions, you know?

16:35.229 --> 16:37.762
It's been, like, three
months since we had sex

16:37.864 --> 16:39.322
and even then, it wasn't good.

16:39.357 --> 16:41.366
I just tried to have
sex with him right now,

16:41.468 --> 16:43.756
and he pretended he was
asleep. It is 9:00 PM!

16:43.805 --> 16:45.036
Relationships are complicated.

16:45.138 --> 16:46.071
I mean, I know.

16:46.173 --> 16:49.574
It's about communication and
listening to each other's energies.

16:49.676 --> 16:52.143
Tell him what you want.
Tell him what you need.

16:52.246 --> 16:55.347
That's what Mike and
I do, and we're great.

16:55.449 --> 16:57.382
Wow, you are right.

16:57.484 --> 17:00.218
You just... really get relationships.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.525
I know.

17:01.666 --> 17:03.892
So how long have you two been together?

17:03.927 --> 17:05.190
We've been together...

17:05.291 --> 17:08.393
uh, six long...

17:08.494 --> 17:11.762
long... days.

17:11.865 --> 17:14.299
Wait, what?

17:16.502 --> 17:18.803
Well, okay.

17:18.905 --> 17:21.940
Well... it... but our connection
is like super powerful.

17:22.041 --> 17:25.510
Um, it's like we've known each other
for, like, three months, four months.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.416
- Like, it's...
- What's his middle name?

17:28.626 --> 17:29.681
Berto?

17:29.783 --> 17:30.749
Where's he from?

17:30.851 --> 17:32.083
From Ohio.

17:32.185 --> 17:34.474
Or is it Iowa? Somewhere...

17:34.619 --> 17:36.855
Oh, my God. You're
not in a relationship,

17:36.957 --> 17:39.658
you're literally
sleeping with a stranger.

17:39.760 --> 17:42.060
You won't even know for, like,
years, if you even get that far.

17:42.162 --> 17:43.461
And even then, he could end up being

17:43.563 --> 17:46.249
a completely different person
than the guy he is right now.

17:47.565 --> 17:49.934
You're such a fucking idiot.

17:50.037 --> 17:52.937
- I'm sorry. Oh, my God!
- Okay.

17:53.040 --> 17:56.474
Oh, my God. Thank you.
I really needed that.

17:56.576 --> 17:59.277
You moron. Six days!

17:59.379 --> 18:00.578
Okay.

18:00.681 --> 18:03.048
It's not that funny.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.484
This zipper's stuck,
we're gonna have to rip it.

18:06.586 --> 18:09.421
- I know.
- Perfect.

18:12.826 --> 18:13.792
Yeah!

18:16.363 --> 18:17.962
Whoa, those things look dangerous.

18:18.065 --> 18:19.594
It's 'cause I'm rich now.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.199
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

18:21.301 --> 18:24.669
Got a dope waiting job and
I'm making serious bank.

18:24.771 --> 18:27.772
I'm... much more mature
than when you last saw me.

18:27.874 --> 18:30.475
- It looks like it.
- Yes.

18:30.577 --> 18:33.111
Could you close your eyes?

18:33.213 --> 18:34.979
All right. Closed.

18:37.918 --> 18:40.952
Well, Steph seems really nice.

18:41.054 --> 18:42.454
She is.

18:42.556 --> 18:45.123
Yeah, she seems cool and...

18:45.225 --> 18:48.526
pretty and I hope you guys are, um,

18:48.628 --> 18:50.161
making each other orgasm a lot.

18:50.263 --> 18:52.931
Uh, you know, Ilana,
me and you, we had...

18:53.033 --> 18:54.632
We had our own thing going and...

18:54.667 --> 18:56.768
and that was fun but now, I'm...

18:56.870 --> 18:58.702
I'm getting what I want and I'm happy

18:58.764 --> 19:00.805
and I hope you're
getting what you want too.

19:00.907 --> 19:03.007
Yeah.

19:03.110 --> 19:05.043
Oh, you can open your eyes now.

19:05.145 --> 19:06.811
What were you doing
while they were closed?

19:06.913 --> 19:10.081
I'm gonna need to buy Damien
a bottle of wine or something.

19:10.183 --> 19:12.283
Sorry you had to see me like this.

19:12.386 --> 19:14.419
You're lucky you got out
when you did, brother.

19:14.521 --> 19:17.155
I am a rich, disgusting monster.

19:19.559 --> 19:20.992
It's okay.

19:21.094 --> 19:22.827
You should probably just take a shower.

19:22.929 --> 19:27.031
Yeah, what I just did when you
closed your eyes made it worse.

19:27.134 --> 19:31.369
Much, much, much worse.
It became a medical issue.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.507
There's only one Ilana Wexler.

19:41.615 --> 19:43.348
Okay, just let me get this out.

19:43.450 --> 19:47.085
Um, someone recently told me that
I'm not a relationship person,

19:47.187 --> 19:49.687
so I think I just dove
into this too fast.

19:49.790 --> 19:52.757
I think I just need some time
to really figure myself out.

19:52.859 --> 19:56.060
I just wanna make sure you
know it's me and not you.

19:56.163 --> 19:59.464
Oh, well, yeah. It's only been six days.

19:59.566 --> 20:01.499
I didn't realize we
were being exclusive.

20:01.601 --> 20:02.767
What?

20:02.869 --> 20:05.937
Well, I've been sleeping
with a couple people.

20:06.039 --> 20:09.140
Okay, well, I guess
there's nothing more to say

20:09.242 --> 20:11.158
unless you have something to say.

20:11.295 --> 20:12.544
I lost the heartbeat!

20:15.315 --> 20:17.982
Oh...

20:18.084 --> 20:19.851
How'd it go?

20:19.953 --> 20:21.586
I... I let him down easy.

20:21.688 --> 20:22.787
Yeah, it was tough.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.649
- Good girl.
- Yeah.

20:27.222 --> 20:29.188
Okay, baby. Here we go.

20:29.290 --> 20:31.457
- Ow! Ow!
- Hey!

20:31.559 --> 20:33.659
You know, I wanted last
night to be so perfect.

20:33.762 --> 20:36.696
But I can't stuff my
tips into my empty heart.

20:36.798 --> 20:39.465
- Ow!
- Ay! Ay! Ay!

20:39.567 --> 20:41.334
- I'm so sorry.
- God!

20:41.436 --> 20:43.603
And now I have to lose these tips.

20:43.705 --> 20:45.772
It's like they're leaving
office all over again.

20:45.874 --> 20:46.973
I know.

20:47.075 --> 20:49.308
I think it is time for
me to lose my tip too.

20:49.410 --> 20:51.210
- I'm so sorry, Jaimé.
- It's okay.

20:51.312 --> 20:53.246
- Ow!
- I'm so sorry.

20:53.348 --> 20:54.466
It's okay.

20:54.482 --> 20:57.150
I'm so sorry too. It's a tough call.

20:59.488 --> 21:03.356
I don't have, um, a
like... a tip metaphor

21:03.458 --> 21:05.694
- for me, personally, for today.
- It's okay.

21:05.758 --> 21:08.227
But I did realize,
you know, maybe I'm not
