lying around, probably.

01:26.936 --> 01:27.687

01:52.712 --> 01:55.415

01:56.916 --> 01:59.669
i cleared my calendar right through
the end of the year

01:59.669 --> 02:02.672
and a good chunk of the next.

02:02.672 --> 02:06.059
bill, these old gifts
aren't for lenore,are they?

02:06.476 --> 02:07.977

02:17.270 --> 02:18.605
[sniffing]

02:18.605 --> 02:21.524
well, it's very unlikely
that, uh...

02:22.025 --> 02:22.826
[crying]

02:22.826 --> 02:24.828
well, i--i guess you never know.

02:25.328 --> 02:26.830

rudy beeker, yes-v.p.

02:35.622 --> 02:38.291
all this talk about
people makes me...

02:38.291 --> 02:40.293
you know what it
makes me think about?

02:40.293 --> 02:41.794
break-ups.

02:41.794 --> 02:44.097
you ever think about
that dead boyfriend of yours?

02:44.097 --> 02:45.265
well--

02:45.265 --> 02:47.634
i wonder if you'll
ever find someone again.

02:47.634 --> 02:51.387
i mean, most people just get one relationship
in this life.

02:51.387 --> 02:53.890
luanne, honey,can you help me serve
at the party?

02:53.890 --> 02:56.392

03:12.292 --> 03:14.577
marie. yeah,she was cute.

03:14.577 --> 03:16.579

about something else, huh?

03:16.579 --> 03:17.914
oh, yeah, sure.

03:17.914 --> 03:19.832
remember bob cecil, peggy?

03:19.832 --> 03:22.168
you went to a basketball game
together.

03:22.585 --> 03:23.469
you liked him.

03:23.970 --> 03:26.339
well, that was 10th grade.
no, i didn't.

03:26.339 --> 03:28.841
yeah, you did.
but he didn't like you.

03:32.845 --> 03:34.847
uh, shouldn't you
be doing this?

03:34.847 --> 03:36.349
he likes serving.

03:36.849 --> 03:38.351
oh, after last night,
it is a miracle

03:38.851 --> 03:40.353
i have my appetite
back at all.

03:40.353 --> 03:42.855
i just don't see why bill must ruin
all of our dinners

03:43.356 --> 03:44.857
personally,i can live without him.

03:44.857 --> 03:45.825
me, too.

03:45.825 --> 03:48.328
peggy, a little more
than 20 years ago,

03:48.328 --> 03:51.831
i set arlen high's
single-season rushing record.

03:51.831 --> 03:53.833
sure, i had legs
like a jackrabbit,

03:53.833 --> 03:55.835
but bill dauterive
blocked for me.

03:55.835 --> 03:58.338
and the running back
who forgets his front line

03:58.338 --> 04:00.840
that's the man i wouldn't want
to have to dinner.

04:00.840 --> 04:03.876
shame on you.
shame on you both.

04:08.097 --> 04:09.933
(bill)

04:14.520 --> 04:18.524
so, uh, were they all out
of dogs there, bill?

04:18.524 --> 04:21.728
no, no, iguanas are
very trendy these days

04:21.728 --> 04:26.733
you see them in cigar bars
with movie stars.

04:26.733 --> 04:29.736
come on.come on, lenore.

04:29.736 --> 04:31.404
you've named it lenore?

04:31.404 --> 04:33.906
well, yeah, i--i thought
it looked like a lenore.

04:33.906 --> 04:36.409
i think he's just not
very hungry right now.

04:36.409 --> 04:38.411
i mean, with so many
new people.

04:41.547 --> 04:44.467
uh, oh, should i leave?

04:44.467 --> 04:45.468
thank you.

04:53.810 --> 04:56.312
(bill)
don't worry. it's dead

04:56.562 --> 04:57.730
[all gasping]

05:00.733 --> 05:03.736
i cannot eat another meal with bill
at our dinner table.

05:03.736 --> 05:06.272
why? bill seemed
a lot happier tonight.

05:06.773 --> 05:09.409
honey, that iguana
is a cry for help.

05:09.409 --> 05:12.362
a hissing,disease-ridden cry
for help.

05:13.579 --> 05:14.998
luanne, knock!

05:14.998 --> 05:15.999
i had a bad dream.

05:16.499 --> 05:17.917
[gasps]
bill.

05:17.917 --> 05:19.752
i dreamt that lenore came back
and stole lenore.

05:20.203 --> 05:22.005
and then lenore
drove off with lenore,

05:22.005 --> 05:23.923
and i ran down the street
after them

05:23.923 --> 05:26.709
and i yelled,
"lenore! lenore!"

05:26.709 --> 05:28.711
and then my teeth
fell out.

05:28.711 --> 05:30.213
peggy, you were there.

05:30.213 --> 05:31.964
can i sleep
in your living room?

05:31.964 --> 05:32.965
[sighing]

05:32.965 --> 05:34.300
yes, bill.

05:37.303 --> 05:38.304
i'm giving you
24 hours

05:38.805 --> 05:41.107
to get me out
of that man's dreams.

05:42.892 --> 05:44.143
shall we?

05:44.143 --> 05:45.144
[sighing]

05:45.645 --> 05:46.446
no.

05:46.446 --> 05:48.114
[iguana hissing]
you need a minute?

05:48.448 --> 05:49.949
uh, bill,

05:49.949 --> 05:53.703
i want to have dinner tonight,
just the family.

05:53.703 --> 05:56.039
you don't want me
coming to dinner?

05:56.039 --> 05:58.041
why don't you
just take the night

05:58.041 --> 06:00.043
to practice
being happy, ok?

06:00.043 --> 06:02.045
yeah, ok,that's fine.no problem.

06:02.045 --> 06:05.164
i--i like eating alone
. i--i prefer it, even.

06:05.164 --> 06:07.667
no offense to your family

06:07.667 --> 06:09.669
oh, it is
just so wonderful.

06:10.169 --> 06:11.921

06:30.690 --> 06:32.191
[hank chuckles]

06:32.191 --> 06:34.777
and then the clint eastwood character
would say:

06:35.278 --> 06:37.780
"that propane tank is empty."

06:37.780 --> 06:39.499
wouldn't that
be a good movie?

06:39.499 --> 06:42.502
good? that would be
a great movie.

06:42.502 --> 06:44.921
and would you
direct it, uncle hank?

06:44.921 --> 06:48.040
yeah, me maybe,
or your aunt peggy.

06:48.040 --> 06:50.543

07:33.052 --> 07:36.422
you know who i feel
sorriest for in all this?

07:36.422 --> 07:38.925
bill. we need to find him
a psychiatrist.

07:39.425 --> 07:41.928
he's just suicidal,
peggy, he's not crazy.

07:41.928 --> 07:43.930
we've just gotta
watch him constantly

07:43.930 --> 07:45.431
until he snaps out of it.

07:45.431 --> 07:47.934
i don't think bill
is gonna snap out of it.

07:47.934 --> 07:49.435
there's nothing
we can do

07:49.435 --> 07:51.270
but sit back and watch
the bloodbath.

07:51.270 --> 07:53.239
no, he's our friend.

07:53.239 --> 07:54.740
now, dale, you make your own hours,

07:55.241 --> 07:56.242
so you take the day shift.

08:02.748 --> 08:03.749
we're trying to
do something here.

08:04.250 --> 08:04.750
[sighs]

08:07.703 --> 08:09.088
so, uh...

08:09.088 --> 08:10.339
huh.

08:10.339 --> 08:12.592
this shouldn't be here.

08:13.092 --> 08:15.094
so, uh,maybe you ought to
get to bed

08:15.595 --> 08:16.929
and try to sleep
this thing off.

08:16.929 --> 08:18.764
all i do is sleep.

08:18.764 --> 08:21.267
i guess i'm just getting
in practice, huh,

08:21.267 --> 08:22.602

08:22.935 --> 08:23.886
[exclaiming]

08:24.387 --> 08:26.189
come on, bill.
how about a beer?

08:26.556 --> 08:28.057
beer's a depressant, hank.

08:28.474 --> 08:29.775
don't go blaming the beer.

08:40.903 --> 08:41.904
[sighing]

08:41.904 --> 08:43.405
it's electric, bill.

08:43.405 --> 08:46.409
yeah, but it's still
getting pretty hot.

08:46.909 --> 08:47.793

fancy one?

09:03.309 --> 09:05.561
i like the way silk feels
on my skin.

09:05.845 --> 09:08.180
silk is for pantyhose, bill.

09:08.180 --> 09:11.684
they're all i got.

11:31.791 --> 11:35.294
this morning bill tried to drown himself
in the toilet.

11:35.795 --> 11:37.713
so do you think you could find him
a date?

11:37.713 --> 11:41.217
uh, i would have to invite a woman
over for dinner

11:41.217 --> 11:43.969
and, of course,never tell her
that bill would be here.

11:43.969 --> 11:45.805
thanks, peggy.

11:45.805 --> 11:47.473
[crickets chirping]

11:51.894 --> 11:53.896
they won't
let me have a knife.

11:53.896 --> 11:56.399
i'm in the middle
of killing myself.

11:56.399 --> 11:58.684
do you like iguanas,
mrs. tobis?

12:00.269 --> 12:01.604
you lied to me, peggy.

12:02.021 --> 12:05.024
mr. dauterive is a collector
of exotic reptilia

12:05.024 --> 12:06.325
you collect
throw pillows.

12:06.692 --> 12:08.694
i have some pillow
s on my couch,

12:08.694 --> 12:10.496
but that doesn't
make me insane.

12:10.780 --> 12:12.782
and in answer
to your question,

12:13.282 --> 12:17.703
i find iguanas to be filthy,
repulsive creatures.

12:17.703 --> 12:20.005
why, i think we all could use
a bath.

12:20.339 --> 12:21.207
[gasps]

12:25.377 --> 12:27.880
well, when it's your own.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.381
you are a gross man.

12:29.765 --> 12:30.216
sheila!

12:30.216 --> 12:31.434
marry me.

12:31.434 --> 12:32.184
bill.

12:32.685 --> 12:33.519
oh, this is so exciting.

12:33.853 --> 12:34.854
i just want my coat.

12:34.854 --> 12:37.389
for the love of god,
get me my coat.

12:37.389 --> 12:38.891
allow me.

12:40.726 --> 12:41.894
[both gasp]

12:42.061 --> 12:44.864

12:50.236 --> 12:51.904
[bill moans]

12:52.404 --> 12:54.406
sheila,i should tell you
right now,

12:54.406 --> 12:56.292
i have already given him
your number.

13:06.552 --> 13:07.803
[grunting]

13:08.087 --> 13:08.804
dale.

13:08.804 --> 13:10.840
he would have
wanted me to have it.

13:10.840 --> 13:12.725
he's still alive.

13:12.725 --> 13:15.060
nitpicking ain't
gonna bring him back.

13:15.928 --> 13:18.564
[sobbing]

13:18.564 --> 13:22.485
help me. hank, help me.
help me look for lenore.

13:22.485 --> 13:27.239
bill, can't you see that this whole lenore thing is your problem?

13:27.239 --> 13:29.742
the iguana,these presents
, this old tree.

13:29.742 --> 13:31.110
get rid of this stuff.

13:31.110 --> 13:34.363
no. no, i couldn't.
i couldn't.

13:34.363 --> 13:36.165
see, when--when
she comes back--

13:36.532 --> 13:38.617
she's never coming back.
it's so obvious.

13:39.118 --> 13:41.036
she doesn't want
this stupid stocking.

13:41.036 --> 13:41.787
no!

13:42.872 --> 13:44.757
or whatever's in this box.

13:45.124 --> 13:46.258
no.

13:48.844 --> 13:50.346
or this.

13:50.346 --> 13:51.130
[whimpers]

13:51.547 --> 13:52.681
or this.

13:52.681 --> 13:53.549
no.

13:54.433 --> 13:55.351
there.

13:55.351 --> 13:56.352
[gasps]

13:56.852 --> 13:58.354
[sighs]

13:58.354 --> 13:59.355
you feel ok?

14:02.358 --> 14:03.726
i don't feel anything.

14:03.726 --> 14:05.978
great, i knew
you'd snap out of this.

14:07.863 --> 14:09.698
uh, sure you're ok?

14:10.115 --> 14:10.983
yes.

14:10.983 --> 14:12.484
good.

14:12.484 --> 14:14.486
now i can tell you,

14:14.486 --> 14:16.322
you were acting
pretty weird there.

14:16.789 --> 14:17.990
yes.

14:17.990 --> 14:20.376
ok, then.
i'll see you tomorrow.

14:27.249 --> 14:30.469
i was really hard on him
but it was all for the best.

14:30.469 --> 14:33.472
can you imagine if he'd shown up
at our party with lenore?

14:33.472 --> 14:35.224
well, are you sure he's ok?

14:35.641 --> 14:36.892
i asked him twice.

14:37.893 --> 14:39.395
well, there's
that lizard.

14:48.938 --> 14:50.940
hey. hey, who are you?

14:50.940 --> 14:53.158
?
what are you doing
in bill's backyard

14:53.158 --> 14:57.029
[feminine voice]
hank, don't you
recognize me?

14:57.496 --> 14:59.448
i'm lenore.

14:59.448 --> 15:00.833
what is going on?

15:01.283 --> 15:04.920
well, i'm just washing a dress
for your big party, silly.

15:09.875 --> 15:11.710
bill, take off
the dress.

15:12.127 --> 15:15.130
why do you keep
calling me bill?

15:15.130 --> 15:17.933
my name is lenore, silly.

15:17.933 --> 15:21.887
i've come back
because i love bill so much

15:21.887 --> 15:23.889
and i really missed him.

15:23.889 --> 15:25.391
no, uh-uh,
this is too much.

15:25.391 --> 15:27.393
,
in high school,
you blocked for me

15:27.393 --> 15:28.894
but i did my job, too.

15:28.894 --> 15:30.396
i ran through the hole

15:30.396 --> 15:32.898
setting arlen high's
single-season rushing record,

15:33.399 --> 15:34.400
as you recall.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.201
and now here i am
blocking for you,

15:36.201 --> 15:37.536
but you're not even trying.

15:37.903 --> 15:39.905
i don't even know what kind of game
you're playing.

15:39.905 --> 15:42.908
maybe some kind
of crazy tennis.

15:42.908 --> 15:47.329
hank, ok, then.
nice visiting with you.

15:47.329 --> 15:49.048
see you at the party.

15:49.048 --> 15:51.550
no. no,you stay away
from my party.

15:51.550 --> 15:53.886
no party.you got that?

15:54.219 --> 15:55.971
i'm already invited,
so there.

15:57.256 --> 15:58.757
oh, hello.

15:58.757 --> 16:01.560
do you gentlemen think you could spare
a beer for a lady?

16:01.977 --> 16:03.729
come on,you know you're bill.

16:04.229 --> 16:07.232
no, no,i don't know that.
i'm--i'm lenore.

16:07.650 --> 16:11.570
well, if you're lenore
, then where's bill, huh?

16:11.570 --> 16:13.572
uh, bill's in the house.

16:13.572 --> 16:14.573
[giggles]

16:14.573 --> 16:16.158
you want me to go get him?

16:16.158 --> 16:18.160
i'm skeptical
that you could,

16:18.160 --> 16:20.162
yet intrigued
that you may.

16:23.165 --> 16:28.003
bill's been acting a little weird lately,
don't you think?

16:30.005 --> 16:31.090
maybe it's me.

16:31.590 --> 16:33.092
uh, bill's busy.

16:33.092 --> 16:34.093
[clears throat]

16:34.093 --> 16:36.595
i needed a wrap.
it's chilly.

16:41.600 --> 16:42.601
yup.

16:42.601 --> 16:45.604
all right,
that's it.

16:45.604 --> 16:47.439
(peggy)
honey, you're peeling
in anger.

16:47.439 --> 16:49.274
you should be able
to get more than one french fry

16:49.775 --> 16:50.609
out of a whole idaho.

16:51.060 --> 16:52.561
yeah, maybe i am angry.

16:53.062 --> 16:56.065
i used my vacation days
bathing the son of a bitch,

16:56.065 --> 16:58.400
and he threatens
to crash my christmas party.

16:58.400 --> 17:00.819
he's not being
an ingrate on purpose.

17:00.819 --> 17:04.823
the only way that bill could get lenore
back was to become her.

17:04.823 --> 17:06.325
mmm-hmm.
i wouldn't be surprised

17:06.825 --> 17:08.327
if there was some
psychological basis to it.

17:08.827 --> 17:12.247
well, i don't know anything
about psychology

17:12.748 --> 17:16.752
but it sounds to me
like mr. dauterive needs closure.

17:16.752 --> 17:19.253
he needs to realize
that lenore's never coming back,

17:19.253 --> 17:21.757
and he needs to just move on
with his life.

17:22.257 --> 17:24.009
it's the same thing
buckley's angel told me.

17:24.009 --> 17:25.978
buckley's angel is the only on
e making sense.

17:26.478 --> 17:27.479
[gasps]

17:27.479 --> 17:29.481
how about i invite the real lenore
to the party

17:29.982 --> 17:32.317
and just settle this thing
once and for all?

17:32.317 --> 17:33.819
oh, i hope it works,

17:33.819 --> 17:36.321
but if they show up in the same dress,

17:36.321 --> 17:37.773
it'll be a disaster.

17:40.242 --> 17:42.745
??[country music playing]

17:45.330 --> 17:47.699
listen, hank,
we got all our clients here.

17:47.699 --> 17:48.700
big fish, little fish.

17:49.201 --> 17:50.702
so, if you see some little fish
cornering me,

17:51.203 --> 17:52.704
it's your job
to pull me out.

17:52.704 --> 17:54.206
we should treat all our clients

17:54.206 --> 17:56.208
like big fish,
mr. strickland

17:56.208 --> 17:58.010
yeah. good, good.
save that for the little fish.

17:59.711 --> 18:01.213

mr. and mrs. dauterive?

18:11.440 --> 18:12.274
why, thanks.

18:12.691 --> 18:14.443
what the hell's
going on here, hank?

18:14.443 --> 18:18.280

this is some kind of mistake.

oh, honey,
but you have to come by.

18:48.894 --> 18:52.014
ok, how about i
hand bill the phone?

18:52.014 --> 18:54.516
it would really help...

18:54.516 --> 18:58.020
well, if you could
just tell him you send your love...

18:59.521 --> 19:02.024
yeah, sure.
no, i understand.

we fight during the night.

we can work stuff out.

20:31.363 --> 20:32.864
i'm a good husband.

i would have called.

that's all?

20:44.259 --> 20:49.097
that's why you left?
it's simple as that?

20:49.097 --> 20:51.099
you didn't even
have the courtesy

20:51.600 --> 20:54.102
to send me
a dear john letter?

20:54.603 --> 20:58.106
well, i tell you what,
i consider that rude.

right now.
