00:24.722 --> 00:27.624
<i>Okay, ace at zero-one.
You're past that.</i>

00:27.626 --> 00:30.259
<i>Copy that, Gold Leader.
Heading your way now.</i>

00:32.298 --> 00:33.766
<i>Copy. Start your run.</i>

00:40.205 --> 00:43.374
<i>Freelancer.
Move to East. Second building.</i>

00:43.376 --> 00:45.809
<i>Last confirmation,
five minutes ago. 0300.</i>

00:45.811 --> 00:49.312
<i>Going inside. We are a go.</i>

00:49.314 --> 00:51.818
<i>GPS confirms location.
Target inside.</i>

00:55.388 --> 00:58.221
<i>Leave that C4. Stat.</i>

00:58.223 --> 01:00.356
<i>C4, ready!</i>

01:00.358 --> 01:02.728
<i>It's live. Stand back.</i>

01:05.964 --> 01:07.663
<i>Let's go.</i>

01:07.665 --> 01:10.367
<i>Stay on the lookout.
And keep your weapons close.</i>

01:10.369 --> 01:13.236
<i>He could be anywhere inside.</i>

01:13.238 --> 01:15.305
<i>Mission control,
he doesn't seem to be here.</i>

01:15.307 --> 01:17.475
<i>Keep looking.
We have to find him.</i>

01:17.477 --> 01:19.109
<i>Check everywhere.</i>

01:19.111 --> 01:21.748
- <i>Over here.</i>
- <i>He's in here. By the gate.</i>

01:25.983 --> 01:28.451
- <i>There's no way in!</i>
- <i>It's locked.</i>

01:28.453 --> 01:30.087
<i>Open it. Just open it.</i>

01:30.089 --> 01:31.353
<i>Copy.</i>

01:31.355 --> 01:33.255
<i>Hey! That's us.</i>

01:33.257 --> 01:34.825
<i>He knew we were coming!</i>

01:34.827 --> 01:37.429
<i>Charging in like a dog?</i>

01:43.736 --> 01:45.903
<i>Typical Americans.</i>

01:45.905 --> 01:47.770
<i>Zolotov...</i>

01:47.772 --> 01:49.775
<i>But you are already too late.</i>

01:52.777 --> 01:55.377
<i>Gold leader,
are you seeing this?</i>

01:55.379 --> 01:58.081
<i>Copy, ace zero-one!
There's something wrong with my bird, too.</i>

01:58.083 --> 02:00.150
<i>I'm going to push back
on over to Winston and, uh...</i>

02:00.152 --> 02:03.453
<i>Agh!
My bird is unresponsive!</i>

02:03.455 --> 02:05.555
<i>Rivers, get control!</i>

02:05.557 --> 02:07.558
<i>What is Nikto Virus?</i>

02:07.560 --> 02:10.158
<i>Shit!
This bird is flying itself!</i>

02:10.161 --> 02:13.029
<i>Two-zero-niner, mayday!
Mayday! Bailout! Eject, eject!</i>

02:13.031 --> 02:16.701
<i>It's not working!
I repeat, eject is not working!</i>

02:20.005 --> 02:22.041
<i>How did he know?</i>

02:59.378 --> 03:00.409
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:00.411 --> 03:01.410
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

03:01.412 --> 03:03.146
Yeah.

03:03.148 --> 03:04.517
Hello. Welcome aboard.

03:06.118 --> 03:07.384
- Hey. How are you?
- Good. How are you?

03:07.386 --> 03:08.721
Good.

03:11.457 --> 03:13.289
Hi. Welcome aboard, guys.

03:13.291 --> 03:14.626
- How you doing?
- Great.

03:23.201 --> 03:24.870
Hi. Welcome aboard.

03:28.474 --> 03:30.142
Hi. Welcome aboard.

03:38.951 --> 03:39.886
Welcome aboard.

03:40.820 --> 03:42.188
Hi. Welcome aboard.

04:20.059 --> 04:22.692
<i>LaGuardia Tower

04:22.694 --> 04:24.261
<i>fly straight out
to advised runway,</i>

04:24.263 --> 04:26.963
<i>23 Left, you are cleared
for takeoff.</i>

04:26.965 --> 04:28.699
Roger that, LaGuardia Tower.

04:28.701 --> 04:31.168
Circle Star 117,
turning at our discretion

04:31.170 --> 04:33.269
to 23 Left,
cleared for takeoff.

04:33.271 --> 04:35.004
Welcome aboard
and thank you for flying

04:35.006 --> 04:36.406
with Circle Star Airlines.

04:36.408 --> 04:38.774
Our first priority
on every flight is safety,

04:38.776 --> 04:39.942
so before we take off,
I'll be giving

04:39.944 --> 04:42.177
a brief safety presentation.

04:42.179 --> 04:43.913
Please make sure that
all carry-on items

04:43.915 --> 04:46.283
are correctly stowed
in an overhead bin...

04:46.285 --> 04:47.350
Hey!

04:47.352 --> 04:48.752
All smaller items
under the seat...

04:48.754 --> 04:50.454
You take it easy
with that foot, man?

04:50.456 --> 04:52.523
Yeah. Sorry.

04:52.525 --> 04:55.091
- Thanks.
- Yeah!

04:55.093 --> 04:57.394
...responsibilities
of emergency exit seating

04:57.396 --> 05:00.196
on your information card
located in your seat pocket.

05:00.198 --> 05:02.132
As we prepare to leave the gate,
please make sure

05:02.134 --> 05:03.432
your seatbelt
is securely fastened.

05:03.434 --> 05:05.369
It's fine, babe.

05:05.371 --> 05:08.004
The flight attendant will
take care of it in a second.

05:08.006 --> 05:10.874
Total disregard
for the rules.

05:10.876 --> 05:12.175
Man, I can't
stand people like that.

05:12.177 --> 05:13.910
Oh, I know.

05:13.912 --> 05:16.011
I hope that my mom
is going to like you.

05:16.013 --> 05:17.213
You're both sticklers
for the rules.

05:17.215 --> 05:18.814
Yeah?
Hopefully, hopefully.

05:19.951 --> 05:21.386
- You know I'm ticklish.
- I know.

05:25.157 --> 05:27.156
On behalf of everyone
at Circle Star Airlines,

05:27.158 --> 05:28.824
I'd like to thank
for paying attention.

05:28.826 --> 05:31.060
Now sit back, relax
and enjoy the flight

05:31.062 --> 05:32.764
and thank you for flying
with Circle Star.

05:36.768 --> 05:38.567
Sir?
Please stow away your tablet.

05:38.569 --> 05:41.737
Sure, no problem.
Just trying to get this through.

05:41.739 --> 05:43.939
Sir? Please.

05:43.941 --> 05:46.946
Just give me one second, please.
I'm almost there.

05:48.347 --> 05:50.112
Got it.

05:50.114 --> 05:52.218
- Can I?
- No. Allow me.

06:04.595 --> 06:06.031
- Thanks.
- Mm-hm.

06:19.944 --> 06:21.810
Yulia, the plane leaves
in three hours.

06:21.812 --> 06:23.014
Hurry up!

06:29.054 --> 06:31.924
You got something
you'd like to say to me?

06:34.025 --> 06:35.759
I told you and your brother
when you started

06:35.761 --> 06:37.192
that this wasn't an easy job,

06:37.194 --> 06:39.731
and you have to move fast
or you're out.

07:10.127 --> 07:11.229
Quickly!

07:21.941 --> 07:25.175
<i>Delta Romeo Foxtrot 66.
No taxi clearance.</i>

07:25.177 --> 07:27.143
<i>Cut engines and
wait for instruction.</i>

07:27.145 --> 07:29.882
<i>66! No clearance!
Cut your engines!</i>

07:31.350 --> 07:32.783
Clear the runway.

07:32.785 --> 07:34.485
We're experiencing
a malfunction.

07:34.487 --> 07:36.451
Unable to disengage the engines.

07:36.453 --> 07:37.887
<i>Negative, 66.</i>

07:37.889 --> 07:40.557
<i>Charlie Sierra 117
maintains priority.</i>

07:40.559 --> 07:43.026
<i>No clearance on 25 left beta.</i>

07:43.028 --> 07:44.864
<i>Hold and
wait for instructions.</i>

07:57.442 --> 07:58.975
Whoa, whoa!
What are they doing?

07:58.977 --> 08:00.244
Hey, they're coming right us!

08:00.246 --> 08:01.845
There's not enough
time to stop.

08:01.847 --> 08:03.245
ATC, quick!

08:03.247 --> 08:05.882
Tower! Charlie Sierra 117
on 25 left delta.

08:05.884 --> 08:07.117
Bogey on collision course!

08:07.119 --> 08:09.088
Requesting immediate
instruction!

08:40.818 --> 08:42.186
All right, we're going up!

08:42.188 --> 08:43.823
Tower!

08:57.135 --> 08:59.004
Up, up, up, up, up, up!

09:06.645 --> 09:08.213
Turn left, turn left, turn left!

09:22.995 --> 09:25.128
Nice and easy.
Easy. Easy.

09:25.130 --> 09:26.196
Check the pressure!
Check the pressure!

09:26.198 --> 09:27.333
Check the pressure!

09:40.078 --> 09:42.711
- What the hell...
- Captain! Captain!

09:42.713 --> 09:44.047
I got it! I got it!
Tight to the right!

09:44.049 --> 09:45.384
To the right!

09:50.454 --> 09:52.288
Easy, Mack. Easy.

09:52.290 --> 09:54.360
- Easy. Easy, easy.
- Whoa!

10:01.665 --> 10:03.566
Mack, you good? Mack?

10:03.568 --> 10:04.868
What were they thinking?

10:04.870 --> 10:07.669
Man, we could have been killed!
They came right at us!

10:07.671 --> 10:08.803
I know.

10:08.805 --> 10:10.673
<i>Code Red! Code Red! 99.</i>

10:10.675 --> 10:14.177
<i>Terrorist hijacking
on Delta Romeo Foxtrot 66.</i>

10:14.179 --> 10:15.512
<i>All aircraft grounded.</i>

10:15.514 --> 10:17.547
<i>Divert course to
the nearest airport.</i>

10:17.549 --> 10:18.981
<i>Stand by.</i>

10:18.983 --> 10:20.182
They're routing us to Linden.

10:20.184 --> 10:21.618
All right.
Well, all right.

10:21.620 --> 10:23.586
LaGuardia must be
absolute chaos right now.

10:23.588 --> 10:25.956
You bet your ass.

10:25.958 --> 10:28.591
They must be
locking it down by now.

10:28.593 --> 10:29.759
Are you good?

10:29.761 --> 10:31.794
Yeah.

10:31.796 --> 10:33.598
Good.

10:37.868 --> 10:39.969
Stage Two is ready.

10:39.971 --> 10:42.675
Wonderful. Call Zolotov.

10:53.886 --> 10:54.917
<i>Da?</i>

10:54.919 --> 10:57.256
Stage One is complete.

11:03.828 --> 11:05.130
For the family.

11:09.468 --> 11:10.468
Never forgotten.

11:19.910 --> 11:21.112
Sir?

11:23.449 --> 11:25.315
Pinto?

11:25.317 --> 11:26.749
What's wrong?

11:26.751 --> 11:29.318
There's been a hijacking.

11:29.320 --> 11:31.389
An airliner
out of LaGuardia.

11:33.958 --> 11:35.124
Walk with me, son.

11:35.126 --> 11:36.927
Yes, sir.

11:36.929 --> 11:39.062
What kind of plane?
Where was it headed?

11:39.064 --> 11:40.730
How many onboard?

11:40.732 --> 11:43.099
Well, that's the good news,
if you want to call it that.

11:43.101 --> 11:45.735
It was an empty
Descartes Airlines airliner

11:45.737 --> 11:46.969
hijacked off the runway.

11:46.971 --> 11:48.370
Then let's shoot
the sucker down!

11:48.372 --> 11:51.207
I need jets in
the air immediately.

11:51.209 --> 11:52.708
Sir, our fleet is still
crippled by the virus

11:52.710 --> 11:54.744
that attacked last night,
the Nikto Virus.

11:54.746 --> 11:56.346
What's the status there?

11:56.348 --> 11:58.748
We have three teams from cyber
working around the clock.

11:58.750 --> 12:00.148
It doesn't affect
passenger airliners,

12:00.150 --> 12:01.951
but the jets are O.O.C.

12:01.953 --> 12:03.653
Not good enough!

12:03.655 --> 12:07.590
I need the problem fixed,
and jets in the air A.S.A.P.

12:07.592 --> 12:10.092
In the meantime,
surface-to-air missiles.

12:10.094 --> 12:13.462
Get me SAMs
targeting that plane.

12:13.464 --> 12:15.097
The virus seems to
have affected anything

12:15.099 --> 12:16.932
with a computer-aided
assisted targeting.

12:16.934 --> 12:18.134
They're rendered useless.

12:18.136 --> 12:19.434
It's like the computers

12:19.436 --> 12:21.037
are eating themselves
from the inside.

12:21.039 --> 12:22.538
How is that even possible?

12:22.540 --> 12:24.373
I mean, our analysts have
never seen anything like it.

12:24.375 --> 12:25.774
The computers should
not be vulnerable

12:25.776 --> 12:27.545
to something like this.

12:32.717 --> 12:35.985
Get me all the data
on the hijacked plane.

12:35.987 --> 12:38.620
General, so nice
of you to join us.

12:38.622 --> 12:39.722
Dr. Liu!

12:39.724 --> 12:42.491
I shouldn't be surprised
to see you.

12:42.493 --> 12:44.461
You're a little over-dressed
for the occasion.

12:44.463 --> 12:46.596
I was pulled
from a wedding.

12:46.598 --> 12:49.499
The president
has asked for my help.

12:49.501 --> 12:53.402
Flight data is backed up
on the Pentagon servers weekly.

12:53.404 --> 12:56.742
The next upload
is tonight at midnight.

12:58.743 --> 13:01.576
If we can't devise
an antivirus,

13:01.578 --> 13:05.548
it will corrupt thousands of
terabytes of intelligence data.

13:05.550 --> 13:08.186
Thank you for lending
your expertise.

13:18.296 --> 13:20.163
What is it?

13:20.165 --> 13:22.097
Ivan Zolotov.

13:22.099 --> 13:25.536
He's claiming responsibility
for the hijacking.

13:30.040 --> 13:31.039
You know him?

13:31.041 --> 13:32.642
By reputation.

13:32.644 --> 13:37.179
He's the leader of Nikto,
an expert on programming.

13:37.181 --> 13:40.115
Years ago, he created DDS1

13:40.117 --> 13:42.952
and took down integral
servers for weeks.

13:42.954 --> 13:45.053
When it finally came out online,

13:45.055 --> 13:48.224
thousands of corporate bank
accounts had been emptied.

13:48.226 --> 13:50.493
- Can we track him?
- Yes.

13:50.495 --> 13:53.062
Send as many
trace route requests

13:53.064 --> 13:55.530
as your servers can handle.

13:55.532 --> 13:58.067
With enough time and data,
I think we'll be able

13:58.069 --> 14:00.202
to pinpoint his location.

14:00.204 --> 14:01.870
You know his world.

14:01.872 --> 14:03.373
General, Zolotov is calling.

14:03.375 --> 14:04.841
I'll take the lead!

14:04.843 --> 14:06.545
Main screen!

14:08.979 --> 14:12.414
<i>Hello, there.
And with whom am I speaking?</i>

14:12.416 --> 14:14.015
Doctor May Li Liu.

14:14.017 --> 14:18.120
<i>Doc, it's a pleasure
to make your acquaintance.</i>

14:18.122 --> 14:20.322
<i>I have followed
your work for years,</i>

14:20.324 --> 14:22.591
<i>and I see a common thread.</i>

14:22.593 --> 14:25.128
<i>We have both used
computer science</i>

14:25.130 --> 14:27.499
<i>in our pursuit of justice.</i>

14:29.166 --> 14:30.499
I see.

14:30.501 --> 14:32.601
<i>I believe in a better world.</i>

14:32.603 --> 14:35.871
<i>Have you heard about
19th century philosopher,</i>

14:35.873 --> 14:38.374
<i>Mikhail Bakunin?</i>

14:38.376 --> 14:40.846
The Russian anarchist?

14:42.747 --> 14:46.115
<i>"We must spread our principles</i>

14:46.117 --> 14:48.118
<i>"not with words,
but with deeds.</i>

14:48.120 --> 14:51.986
<i>"For this, the most popular...
most potent...</i>

14:51.988 --> 14:55.224
<i>and the most irresistible
form of propaganda..."</i>

14:55.226 --> 14:56.993
Then why are we talking?

14:56.995 --> 15:02.030
<i>I like you, doctor...
cutting straight to the core!</i>

15:02.032 --> 15:04.734
<i>So here it is.</i>

15:04.736 --> 15:09.304
<i>We are going to cut off the
head of the American military,</i>

15:09.306 --> 15:11.407
<i>kill everyone in the Pentagon,</i>

15:11.409 --> 15:13.509
<i>kill everyone in Congress,</i>

15:13.511 --> 15:16.144
<i>kill everyone
in the White House.</i>

15:16.146 --> 15:18.047
Find the other planes we lost
when the virus struck.

15:18.049 --> 15:19.414
Yes, sir.

15:19.416 --> 15:20.850
<i>There is only
one hijacked plane.</i>

15:20.852 --> 15:25.087
And so, terror.
That's your goal?

15:25.089 --> 15:26.992
Destruction
for its own sake?

15:28.660 --> 15:32.494
I know you're not
some lunatic, Mr. Zolotov.

15:32.496 --> 15:35.063
What are your demands?

15:35.065 --> 15:36.865
<i>My demands...</i>

15:36.867 --> 15:41.637
<i>I demand America disengage from
its international positions.</i>

15:41.639 --> 15:45.575
That's hundreds and
thousands of troops!

15:45.577 --> 15:47.811
The logistics
are infeasible.

15:47.813 --> 15:51.750
Not to mention the treaties
that it would violate!

15:53.718 --> 15:56.118
<i>Start with southern Ukraine.</i>

15:56.120 --> 15:59.120
<i>If your military hasn't started
moving in the next 60 minutes,</i>

15:59.122 --> 16:01.291
<i>we will fly the plane</i>

16:01.293 --> 16:04.896
<i>into Calvert Cliffs
Nuclear Power Plant.</i>

16:07.431 --> 16:09.999
That's just outside of DC!

16:10.001 --> 16:12.634
All right.

16:12.636 --> 16:14.272
We'll do our best.

16:15.939 --> 16:17.876
<i>60 minutes.</i>

16:27.618 --> 16:29.652
Are you really
recalling the troops?

16:29.654 --> 16:31.586
No, we're
not going to withdraw.

16:31.588 --> 16:33.789
It bought us some time.

16:33.791 --> 16:36.091
We have an hour.

16:36.093 --> 16:39.698
Contact Calvert Cliffs and
begin containment procedures.

16:41.199 --> 16:44.767
I think I found a signal,
but I don't trust the location.

16:44.769 --> 16:47.637
Everything's been encrypted
and rerouted

16:47.639 --> 16:50.740
and encrypted again,
over and over.

16:50.742 --> 16:54.610
Eastern Europe? Ukraine?
Where is he?

16:54.612 --> 16:56.678
I mean, there still might
be more encryption, but...

16:56.680 --> 17:00.448
Go to the Level Eight,
and on the SPAC computer.

17:00.450 --> 17:01.716
I'll use my clearance code.

17:01.718 --> 17:03.286
- All right.
- Let me know... That's it?

17:03.288 --> 17:05.490
Yes, go ahead.

17:11.395 --> 17:13.095
This cannot be right!

17:13.097 --> 17:15.262
Australia?

17:15.265 --> 17:16.464
Something's off.

17:16.467 --> 17:18.933
We cannot engage
with some decoy.

17:18.935 --> 17:21.403
There were anomalies
in his video, you saw them.

17:21.405 --> 17:23.107
The creases...

17:28.279 --> 17:30.382
Just outside Baltimore!

17:33.184 --> 17:34.749
Send in the Special Ops now!

17:34.751 --> 17:37.753
And keep checking that signal!

17:37.755 --> 17:39.454
Okay.

17:39.456 --> 17:42.357
No jets, no guided
surface-to-air missiles!

17:42.359 --> 17:45.394
What's available?

17:45.396 --> 17:47.529
We need to take that plane out!

17:47.531 --> 17:49.932
Uh, shoulder launchers, drones,

17:49.934 --> 17:53.036
small airplanes,
commercial airliners.

17:53.038 --> 17:56.775
Get me a list of planes with
a similar trajectory, quickly!

17:59.543 --> 18:01.143
How many?

18:01.145 --> 18:04.047
Well, there are 11 planes of
similar size within a few miles.

18:04.049 --> 18:06.715
How many of those
have air marshals?

18:06.717 --> 18:09.050
We need presence onboard
to keep the peace.

18:09.052 --> 18:13.890
Just one, Circle Star
Airlines, Flight 117.

18:13.892 --> 18:16.291
Ray Rollins has served
on over 500 flights.

18:16.293 --> 18:18.394
He trained in cyber and combat.

18:18.396 --> 18:19.796
And the pilot?

18:19.798 --> 18:22.032
Tom Elliott,
26 years on the job.

18:23.534 --> 18:25.667
And the Air Force,
for a decade before that.

18:25.669 --> 18:27.202
He's a Persian Gulf
war veteran.

18:27.204 --> 18:29.404
I still don't like it.
Still don't like it.

18:29.406 --> 18:32.107
We can't risk civilians!

18:32.109 --> 18:33.675
Okay, okay, look.

18:33.677 --> 18:37.579
We'll commandeer 30 commercial
planes out of Reagan Airport.

18:37.581 --> 18:41.817
Give 'em fighter pilots.
No civilians at risk.

18:41.819 --> 18:44.121
Okay, checking logistics.
One second.

18:47.858 --> 18:50.660
At the Descartes'
current speed, no.

18:50.662 --> 18:52.528
We wouldn't have time
to get fighter pilots

18:52.530 --> 18:55.330
to and through the airport
and in their fueled aircraft.

18:55.332 --> 18:56.865
It won't work.

18:56.867 --> 18:59.102
Check all airports between
New York and D.C.,

18:59.104 --> 19:00.172
not just Reagan.

19:03.607 --> 19:06.375
Negative. No time.

19:06.377 --> 19:10.846
Get shoulder launchers
stationed outside Trenton.

19:10.848 --> 19:15.220
We'll force it low enough
and blast it out of the sky.

19:16.687 --> 19:18.621
Patch me through
to Captain Elliott.

19:18.623 --> 19:19.857
Patching.

19:23.860 --> 19:25.594
Setting course for Linden.

19:25.596 --> 19:28.130
All systems functional.

19:28.132 --> 19:31.034
<i>Captain Elliott
of Circle Star Airlines,</i>

19:31.036 --> 19:34.005
Flight 117?

19:35.906 --> 19:37.605
Government line.
That's restricted.

19:37.607 --> 19:39.644
This is General Hayes
at the Pentagon.

19:42.547 --> 19:44.079
Captain Elliott speaking.

19:44.081 --> 19:45.448
<i>Listen closely.</i>

19:45.450 --> 19:50.619
<i>A plane has been hijacked
out of LaGuardia.</i>

19:51.722 --> 19:53.321
Yes, sir. We, uh...

19:53.323 --> 19:55.391
We damn near hit it.
What the hell's going on?

19:55.393 --> 19:57.125
Damage report?

19:57.127 --> 20:00.296
We're all good.
All systems are clear.

20:00.298 --> 20:03.132
We are headed to landing.

20:03.134 --> 20:06.501
We should touch down in about...
a couple of minutes or so.

20:06.503 --> 20:09.707
Belay that order,
and maintain course.

20:11.308 --> 20:15.077
Sir, ATC has instructed
us to land. I'm not...

20:15.079 --> 20:16.811
The hijacked plane is
headed towards

20:16.813 --> 20:18.948
Calvert Cliffs
Nuclear Power Plant

20:18.950 --> 20:20.449
just outside Washington, D.C.

20:20.451 --> 20:23.855
<i>You've got one hour
to bring it down.</i>

20:26.257 --> 20:27.259
Nuclear...

20:29.661 --> 20:32.761
I gotta think.
Oh, my God.

20:32.763 --> 20:34.864
Sir, have you deployed
jets yet to intercept?

20:34.866 --> 20:35.865
I don't hear any chatter.

20:35.867 --> 20:37.333
<i>Negative, Captain.</i>

20:37.335 --> 20:39.567
A malfunction in the software.

20:39.569 --> 20:42.204
No jets.

20:42.206 --> 20:46.409
Captain, you have the necessary
military experience,

20:46.411 --> 20:48.111
<i>and have the only
active Air Marshall</i>

20:48.113 --> 20:50.878
<i>in the vicinity
aboard your flight.</i>

20:50.880 --> 20:54.749
<i>You're piloting the only
plane to have a chance.</i>

20:54.751 --> 20:57.519
Look, we'll have a unit
with shoulder launchers

20:57.521 --> 20:59.255
stationed right outside Trenton.

20:59.257 --> 21:02.156
You force that plane below
5,000 feet

21:02.158 --> 21:03.960
and we'll
shoot it out of the sky.

21:03.962 --> 21:07.730
And if you miss
and hit us instead?

21:07.732 --> 21:10.265
You force that plane
below 5,000 feet,

21:10.267 --> 21:13.068
get out of there,
and we'll do the rest.

21:13.070 --> 21:15.773
General, the SAMS unit
is getting into position.

21:28.519 --> 21:31.220
Sir, I think I can do it.

21:31.222 --> 21:34.123
But I'm gonna need to get
both the crew

21:34.125 --> 21:36.358
and the passengers
on the same page.

21:36.360 --> 21:39.494
If it is not unanimous,
I will not do it.

21:39.496 --> 21:42.832
I repeat, I will not do it
if it's not gonna be unanimous.

21:42.834 --> 21:45.300
Let me know when
you've reached a decision.

21:45.302 --> 21:47.736
My people will monitor
the channel.

21:47.738 --> 21:50.073
<i>They'll alert me if necessary.
Out.</i>

21:50.075 --> 21:51.309
Copy.

21:57.882 --> 22:00.916
- All right.
- What do you think about this?

22:00.918 --> 22:02.852
Flying right into harm's way?

22:02.854 --> 22:05.220
I think we're the only
damn plane up here,

22:05.222 --> 22:08.356
and we don't have
much of a choice.

22:08.358 --> 22:09.394
We're it.

22:12.062 --> 22:13.397
I'll go alert the crew.

22:17.401 --> 22:18.933
All right.

22:18.935 --> 22:22.840
Then I'll have the general
speak to the passengers.

22:35.286 --> 22:36.285
Selena?

22:36.287 --> 22:37.119
God!

22:37.121 --> 22:38.788
What's going on, Mack?

22:38.790 --> 22:41.057
The Pentagon's asked us to help
take out the hijacked aircraft.

22:41.059 --> 22:42.392
But...

22:42.394 --> 22:43.692
All right, look, look, look.

22:43.694 --> 22:45.528
If we can force it
below 5,000 feet,

22:45.530 --> 22:47.128
they'll shoot it out of the sky.

22:47.130 --> 22:49.531
That doesn't sound...

22:49.533 --> 22:50.668
Is that safe?

22:52.903 --> 22:55.837
There's a risk, but it's doable.

22:55.839 --> 22:59.040
And you think
this is a good idea?

22:59.042 --> 23:00.411
Well...

23:04.581 --> 23:06.083
I stand
by Captain Elliott.

23:09.220 --> 23:11.987
Okay.
Do what you think is right.

23:11.989 --> 23:13.221
Can you ask
the rest of the crew?

23:13.223 --> 23:15.191
Then we'll talk
to the passengers.

23:15.193 --> 23:16.360
Mm-hm.

23:17.928 --> 23:20.064
Mary, Sarah, the Pentagon
has contacted us.

23:21.999 --> 23:24.933
The plane we barely missed on
take off is hijacked

23:24.935 --> 23:26.801
and headed for Calvert Cliffs.

23:26.803 --> 23:28.202
<i>They need our help
to bring it down</i>

23:28.204 --> 23:31.240
<i>and Captain wants
our consent first.</i>

23:31.242 --> 23:32.976
Okay. Thanks.

23:36.180 --> 23:39.284
We're in, as long
as the passengers consent.

23:40.684 --> 23:41.985
Thank you.

23:56.768 --> 23:59.434
Selena has consent from
the cabin crew.

23:59.436 --> 24:02.973
We just have to get it
from the passengers now.

24:03.840 --> 24:07.212
All right, all right.

24:09.078 --> 24:11.346
Captain Elliott
to General Hayes.

24:11.348 --> 24:14.149
Yes, Captain?

24:14.151 --> 24:17.252
All the crew are in agreement
with the plan.

24:17.254 --> 24:18.487
Acknowledged.

24:18.489 --> 24:21.056
And the passengers?

24:21.058 --> 24:24.492
I thought you'd be
best to talk to them.

24:24.494 --> 24:29.832
It's going to be almost
impossible to get the consensus.

24:29.834 --> 24:31.266
Put me through.

24:31.268 --> 24:32.470
Stand by.

24:40.109 --> 24:42.576
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

24:42.578 --> 24:46.115
<i>We've just been contacted
by the Pentagon</i>

24:46.117 --> 24:47.817
<i>on a secure
government channel.</i>

24:47.819 --> 24:51.886
I need you to please listen
carefully.

24:51.888 --> 24:53.655
Pentagon?

24:53.657 --> 24:56.258
I don't know.

24:56.260 --> 24:57.558
<i>Today...</i>

24:57.560 --> 25:02.765
A plane was hijacked
out of LaGuardia Airport.

25:02.767 --> 25:04.900
They plan to crash the plane

25:04.902 --> 25:07.303
into Calvert Cliffs
Nuclear Power Plant

25:07.305 --> 25:09.808
just outside Washington, D.C.

25:11.642 --> 25:16.578
<i>The nuclear fallout
would be tremendous</i>

25:16.580 --> 25:18.747
and millions of lives lost.

25:18.749 --> 25:21.016
Millions?

25:21.018 --> 25:22.517
He's gonna ask us to help.

25:22.519 --> 25:26.221
<i>The organization
claiming responsibility</i>

25:26.223 --> 25:31.192
has neutralized
our defense system,

25:31.194 --> 25:35.931
our jets, missiles,
everything.

25:35.933 --> 25:38.297
<i>I've reviewed the data.</i>

25:38.299 --> 25:39.968
Between the two of them,
Captain Elliott

25:39.970 --> 25:42.304
and Air Marshal Rollins
have more experience

25:42.306 --> 25:44.839
than any other duo
in proximity.

25:44.841 --> 25:46.441
It's not even close.

25:46.443 --> 25:50.645
This flight has the best chance
ever to save millions of lives.

25:50.647 --> 25:54.516
<i>It's imperative that Flight 117
forces the tracked plane</i>

25:54.518 --> 25:57.419
<i>under 5000 feet,
where our ground forces</i>

25:57.421 --> 25:59.186
<i>will be able to neutralize
the aircraft.</i>

25:59.188 --> 26:01.623
Now there are risks,
the possibility of injury

26:01.625 --> 26:04.058
<i>and even death
for all on board is high.</i>

26:04.060 --> 26:06.228
There are few moments...

26:06.230 --> 26:11.297
decisions in a person's life

26:11.299 --> 26:14.001
that can change everything.

26:14.003 --> 26:16.273
And this is one
of those moments.

26:20.543 --> 26:26.315
We have one hour
to stop the terrorists

26:26.317 --> 26:28.450
from destroying Washington, D.C.

26:28.452 --> 26:31.886
<i>So search your conscience,
listen to your heart,</i>

26:31.888 --> 26:34.155
<i>and decide if you are willing
to take this chance</i>

26:34.157 --> 26:36.557
<i>for yourself
and for your loved ones.</i>

26:36.559 --> 26:38.292
<i>You are the last hope
for millions</i>

26:38.294 --> 26:40.596
<i>of your brothers and sisters
on the ground.</i>

26:40.598 --> 26:42.397
<i>Thank you.</i>

26:42.399 --> 26:44.499
What? What does he mean,
stop terrorists?

26:44.501 --> 26:47.538
What can we even do?
No way! Sorry!

26:49.107 --> 26:50.905
- Logan?
- We got to.

26:50.907 --> 26:52.540
Logan. Come on.

26:52.542 --> 26:53.776
We have to do it.

26:53.778 --> 26:54.876
Not gonna happen!

26:54.878 --> 26:56.111
We have to, man!

26:56.113 --> 26:57.378
- Logan...
- It's not gonna happen!

26:57.380 --> 26:58.614
Terrorists have
hijacked the plane?

26:58.616 --> 27:00.182
- Yeah!
- We're all gonna die!

27:00.184 --> 27:01.383
Please, settle down.

27:01.385 --> 27:02.852
- Please, settle down.
- No, okay?

27:02.854 --> 27:05.056
Ah, shit.
We're losing 'em.

27:09.725 --> 27:11.859
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

27:11.861 --> 27:15.431
<i>Please just be calm and listen
to what I'm about to say.</i>

27:15.433 --> 27:18.200
<i>I understand that
you're scared,</i>

27:18.202 --> 27:19.800
you're confused, I get it!

27:19.802 --> 27:22.003
<i>I'm there with you.</i>

27:22.005 --> 27:24.640
<i>We all got to be
on the same page.</i>

27:24.642 --> 27:27.009
All's we need to do

27:27.011 --> 27:30.311
is just to force
that plane under 5,000 feet.

27:30.313 --> 27:33.347
I know it sounds crazy,
but you gotta trust me.

27:33.349 --> 27:35.083
<i>However, what
we're gonna do first</i>

27:35.085 --> 27:37.188
<i>is we're going to take a vote.</i>

27:39.357 --> 27:42.723
If it's not unanimous,
we won't do it.

27:44.161 --> 27:45.994
She said settle down!

27:45.996 --> 27:50.566
Ray Rollins,
United States Air Marshal,

27:50.568 --> 27:53.269
Badge number 12623,

27:53.271 --> 27:55.403
former United States Air Force,

27:55.405 --> 27:57.205
served eight years overseas.

27:57.207 --> 27:59.040
I'm telling you this
so that you know

27:59.042 --> 28:01.476
I know what I'm talking
about here.

28:01.478 --> 28:04.113
Now the General just came on
and gave us all the details.

28:04.115 --> 28:05.346
We all have them.

28:05.348 --> 28:07.650
A hijacked plane
is making its way

28:07.652 --> 28:10.853
towards the nuclear power
plant in Washington, D.C.

28:10.855 --> 28:13.888
That's Congress.
That's the Pentagon.

28:13.890 --> 28:15.624
That's the White House, okay?

28:15.626 --> 28:17.893
That's thousands,
maybe millions,

28:17.895 --> 28:19.761
of civilians dead...

28:19.763 --> 28:22.199
unless we stop 'em.

28:23.100 --> 28:24.767
But what about us with children?

28:24.769 --> 28:26.501
What about all
the children onboard?

28:26.503 --> 28:27.935
Shouldn't they have
a chance to live?

28:27.937 --> 28:29.637
To live? Ma'am.

28:29.639 --> 28:32.708
No one said anything
about a suicide mission, okay?

28:32.710 --> 28:34.308
We all want to live,

28:34.310 --> 28:36.711
but think of all the children,

28:36.713 --> 28:39.948
all the families,
that we could save.

28:39.950 --> 28:41.650
Do you have a family?

28:41.652 --> 28:44.720
If you did, you wouldn't
ask us to do this.

28:44.722 --> 28:47.689
Look, I got a newborn
waiting at home for me

28:47.691 --> 28:49.290
in Alexandria, okay?

28:49.292 --> 28:51.460
Now, she'd be inside
the blast radius.

28:51.462 --> 28:53.962
You better believe
I know the stakes here.

28:53.964 --> 28:57.699
Grandma, sit down.

28:57.701 --> 28:59.367
I want you to be safe.

28:59.369 --> 29:01.436
But what about dad?

29:01.438 --> 29:03.404
What about the highway
story when he pulled over

29:03.406 --> 29:06.040
and yanked some guy
out of a burning car?

29:06.042 --> 29:08.076
Noah, this is life or death.

29:08.078 --> 29:11.113
Exactly.
That's why we have to do it.

29:11.115 --> 29:13.315
We have to at least try.

29:13.317 --> 29:14.519
We have to honor his memory.

29:17.088 --> 29:18.790
You have so much
of him in you.

29:24.261 --> 29:27.229
Okay, how about
we take that vote now?

29:27.231 --> 29:29.265
Now it's gonna be
a blind vote,

29:29.267 --> 29:30.765
so that you can all
vote however you want

29:30.767 --> 29:32.634
and I'm gonna stay out it
and count

29:32.636 --> 29:37.439
so it's truly all your vote,
and it has to be unanimous.

29:37.441 --> 29:39.210
If it's not unanimous,
it's a no-go.

29:40.010 --> 29:41.212
You ready?

29:42.879 --> 29:43.848
Close your eyes.

29:45.383 --> 29:48.119
All those in favor,
raise your hand.

29:55.326 --> 29:56.527
Okay, put 'em down.

29:58.861 --> 30:01.098
Now all those opposed.

30:04.534 --> 30:08.837
Okay, put 'em down.

30:08.839 --> 30:11.408
Well, we had a
single no-vote, so...

30:14.478 --> 30:17.479
Are you kidding me?
I mean, we got lives at risk.

30:17.481 --> 30:21.083
Maybe the person who
voted no could explain why.

30:21.085 --> 30:22.616
Yeah, we deserve an explanation.

30:22.618 --> 30:25.086
Okay, everyone stop!
I did it, all right?

30:25.088 --> 30:26.654
I voted no.

30:26.656 --> 30:27.923
And don't wanna fight anyone
about it either, okay?

30:27.925 --> 30:29.324
I just want...

30:29.326 --> 30:31.292
Oh, you just want millions
of people to die!

30:31.294 --> 30:32.760
- No one told...
- Yes, you do!

30:32.762 --> 30:33.863
Hey!

30:33.865 --> 30:35.530
Give him a chance
to say his piece.

30:35.532 --> 30:37.900
Can we just talk about
this for one second?

30:37.902 --> 30:40.067
How many planes are in the sky?

30:40.069 --> 30:42.670
A few thousand.
So why us?

30:42.672 --> 30:43.972
Am I the only person on
this plane

30:43.974 --> 30:44.972
that thinks that
this is crazy?

30:46.376 --> 30:47.409
How do you guys think
that this plan ends

30:47.411 --> 30:48.676
if we're not successful?

30:48.678 --> 30:50.645
They say that we're
not gonna...

30:50.647 --> 30:53.350
but I don't see any other way
that we're gonna make an impact.

30:56.520 --> 31:00.955
Okay, fair points.
Let's go through 'em one by one.

31:00.957 --> 31:02.691
How many planes are
in the air right now?

31:02.693 --> 31:05.426
Well, on the East Coast,
probably about 1,000.

31:05.428 --> 31:07.429
That was, until
they told us all to land.

31:07.431 --> 31:09.230
And out of those that are left,

31:09.232 --> 31:11.866
how many have enough
fuel to get to D.C.?

31:11.868 --> 31:12.834
Maybe a few hundred?

31:12.836 --> 31:16.605
Exactly! A few hundred?
So why us?

31:16.607 --> 31:20.275
Because you got a pilot
with military experience

31:20.277 --> 31:21.942
who thinks he can stop 'em.

31:21.944 --> 31:24.581
And I have top level training
in cyber and combat.

31:28.719 --> 31:30.419
I just spoke with the other
cabin crew.

31:30.421 --> 31:33.421
The rest of the passengers
are in agreement.

31:33.423 --> 31:36.825
So that just leaves us.

31:36.827 --> 31:39.161
It's just that...

31:39.163 --> 31:40.229
What?

31:40.231 --> 31:42.497
I don't want us to die!

31:42.499 --> 31:45.366
Look, we're all afraid.

31:45.368 --> 31:46.870
Look around at this cabin.

31:48.605 --> 31:50.238
We're all scared,

31:50.240 --> 31:52.906
but I believe that, together,

31:52.908 --> 31:54.978
we can figure out a way
to save millions of lives.

32:03.953 --> 32:06.087
Okay, I'm in.

32:06.089 --> 32:07.425
Okay.

32:13.930 --> 32:14.865
We're doing it.

32:16.265 --> 32:17.500
We're doing it.

32:23.339 --> 32:24.640
We're a go.

32:24.642 --> 32:26.642
All passengers give
consent, Captain.

32:26.644 --> 32:28.511
It's a go, Captain.

32:34.184 --> 32:36.451
All right.

32:36.453 --> 32:38.388
Set a course
for the rogue airplane.

32:39.255 --> 32:40.321
Setting course, sir.

32:40.323 --> 32:41.725
Son of a bitch.

32:45.495 --> 32:47.261
Captain Elliott, General Hayes.

32:47.263 --> 32:48.596
Yes, Captain?

32:48.598 --> 32:50.766
We now have consent from
all crew and passengers,

32:50.768 --> 32:53.535
and will attempt to force
the hijacked plane within range

32:53.537 --> 32:56.704
of your missiles.

32:56.706 --> 32:58.972
We've set a course to intercept.

32:58.974 --> 33:00.511
God speed.

33:03.180 --> 33:06.448
It will work.

33:06.450 --> 33:08.316
I'm cutting all
communications to cabin.

33:08.318 --> 33:10.117
<i>Repeat, I'm cutting
all communications to cabin.</i>

33:10.119 --> 33:13.387
We're only able to mobilize
one launcher due to

33:13.389 --> 33:16.057
the Nikto virus, captain.

33:16.059 --> 33:18.226
We'll have to make this count.
Good luck.

33:18.228 --> 33:19.597
Over and out.

33:20.864 --> 33:22.730
- Okay, then.
- First things first.

33:22.732 --> 33:25.297
We need to go full throttle
to catch up with them.

33:25.299 --> 33:28.673
Stand by. We're gonna
go in three, two and... go.

33:35.212 --> 33:36.747
All right.

33:38.615 --> 33:39.714
So what's the plan?

33:39.716 --> 33:41.048
Once we get close enough to 'em,

33:41.050 --> 33:42.750
we're gonna approach
from the top.

33:42.752 --> 33:44.653
I know this might be
a little bit before your time,

33:44.655 --> 33:46.855
but are you familiar
with the vortices

33:46.857 --> 33:48.490
crash landings in the '90s?

33:48.492 --> 33:50.224
Sure. A bunch of planes
went down because they...

33:50.226 --> 33:51.859
- Crashed them down.
- ...flew too close together.

33:51.861 --> 33:53.729
And now there are
safety regulations in place

33:53.731 --> 33:55.329
to prevent that from happening.

33:55.331 --> 33:58.900
You betcha, but now we're gonna
use it to our advantage.

33:58.902 --> 34:04.071
You see, each wing generates
a stream of cooling air...

34:04.073 --> 34:05.906
a wake vortex.

34:05.908 --> 34:08.708
So a plane this size
could generate

34:08.710 --> 34:10.578
three to four hundred
mile-per-hour winds,

34:10.580 --> 34:13.781
so if you're flying into it,
it's like you're flying through

34:13.783 --> 34:17.150
a 300-mile per hour wind...
can you go with this now?

34:17.152 --> 34:18.386
That could be tough.

34:18.388 --> 34:20.853
To say the least.

34:20.856 --> 34:24.792
So, if we get in front,
and manage to stay above them,

34:24.793 --> 34:26.661
the force of our wake
will be too strong.

34:26.664 --> 34:28.228
They'll be forced to descend.

34:28.231 --> 34:29.466
Bingo.

34:32.202 --> 34:33.699
Okay.

34:33.702 --> 34:35.672
- Few minutes now.
- Here we go.

34:39.574 --> 34:41.243
What is that?

34:41.245 --> 34:42.243
An airliner?

34:42.245 --> 34:43.911
What are they doing?

34:43.914 --> 34:46.783
I don't know, but we will
not stick around to find out.

34:50.652 --> 34:52.089
Disengaging autopilot.

35:15.144 --> 35:16.944
Ladies and gentlemen, this
is your captain speaking.

35:16.946 --> 35:20.682
We are going to engage
with Descartes.

35:20.684 --> 35:22.250
You may experience
some turbulence,

35:22.252 --> 35:25.620
<i>please keep your seatbelt
fastened at all times.</i>

35:25.622 --> 35:26.924
Thank you.

35:51.281 --> 35:52.680
Well done, Captain!

35:52.682 --> 35:54.517
It ain't over yet.

35:58.455 --> 36:00.124
You good?

36:02.325 --> 36:04.461
- Thank you.
- We're fine now.

36:05.528 --> 36:08.328
We're gonna be okay, okay?

36:08.330 --> 36:10.200
Okay.
Here we go.

36:20.544 --> 36:22.946
Avoid them!

36:26.850 --> 36:28.649
Yulia!

36:28.651 --> 36:30.718
- Descend!
- I'm trying!

36:30.720 --> 36:32.822
We are stuck in their wake!

36:37.361 --> 36:38.727
It's working, Captain!

36:38.729 --> 36:40.194
- Not fast enough!
- They're descending!

36:40.196 --> 36:42.098
Not fast enough,
we gotta get sharper!

36:47.203 --> 36:49.039
- Oh!
- Hold on, baby.

36:54.211 --> 36:56.981
Missile team awaiting
the order, General.

37:00.249 --> 37:02.683
Shit! Turn!

37:02.685 --> 37:05.856
I'm trying!
We are descending too fast!

37:07.024 --> 37:08.122
Captain Elliott!

37:08.124 --> 37:09.591
The Descartes has
falling into range!

37:09.593 --> 37:10.861
Get out of there!

37:11.729 --> 37:13.895
Here we go.

37:13.897 --> 37:15.232
We're climbing up. Ready?

37:28.879 --> 37:31.446
Yulia, I've got it.

37:31.448 --> 37:32.982
Finally.

37:34.383 --> 37:37.053
Number one, fire.

38:09.952 --> 38:12.720
Doctor, the team
outside of Trenton

38:12.722 --> 38:14.158
is reporting unsuccessful.

38:15.859 --> 38:18.359
We have to get our
people out of the city!

38:18.361 --> 38:21.062
Agreed.

38:21.064 --> 38:24.033
Evacuate Washington... now.

38:35.379 --> 38:36.678
Guys?

38:36.680 --> 38:37.879
Guys, look!

38:37.881 --> 38:39.649
They're flying away!

38:48.591 --> 38:50.394
That isn't right.

38:53.964 --> 38:55.095
Can I get you anything?

38:55.097 --> 38:56.730
I need to talk to the Captain.

38:56.732 --> 38:58.000
I'm headed up to the cockpit.

38:58.002 --> 38:58.966
Hey...

38:58.968 --> 39:00.600
It didn't work, did it?

39:00.602 --> 39:01.805
No.

39:03.073 --> 39:05.673
Logan Baker,
New York Fire Department.

39:05.675 --> 39:08.810
Right now, the best thing you
can do is return to your seat

39:08.812 --> 39:11.145
and fasten your seatbelt.

39:11.147 --> 39:12.316
Okay.

39:15.017 --> 39:16.752
Just keep everyone calm.
I'll be right back.

39:16.754 --> 39:17.988
Okay.

39:19.089 --> 39:21.392
Okay, can I get anyone anything?

39:25.461 --> 39:26.894
- Gentlemen?
- Rollins.

39:26.896 --> 39:28.095
The Descartes is still
in the air.

39:28.097 --> 39:29.663
The missile didn't hit it.

39:29.665 --> 39:31.832
I know we've been on
a few flights together before,

39:31.834 --> 39:33.968
but nothing quite like this.

39:33.970 --> 39:36.004
I saw the Descartes
divert course.

39:36.006 --> 39:37.673
You have any more ideas?

39:37.675 --> 39:40.408
None that won't
kill us right away.

39:40.410 --> 39:43.477
Whaddya got?

39:43.479 --> 39:45.613
It's been a few years,
but back in training,

39:45.615 --> 39:49.149
they taught us a way to
synchronize navigation systems.

39:49.151 --> 39:51.551
We could literally
take control of another plane

39:51.553 --> 39:52.886
and land them in tandem.

39:52.888 --> 39:54.488
Rollins...

39:54.490 --> 39:56.825
Listen, listen, it's gotta be
on the same software.

39:56.827 --> 39:58.792
But we're flying the same plane,
just different companies.

39:58.794 --> 40:00.962
It's worth a shot.

40:00.964 --> 40:02.330
Give it a try.

40:02.332 --> 40:03.932
Okay.

40:03.934 --> 40:05.267
Mind if I...

40:05.269 --> 40:06.533
Yeah.

40:06.535 --> 40:08.438
I'll call the General.

40:11.408 --> 40:13.110
Okay.

40:16.046 --> 40:17.879
General Hayes,
this is Captain Elliott.

40:17.881 --> 40:19.948
Yes, Captain?

40:19.950 --> 40:21.915
<i>We know that the missile
missed its target.</i>

40:21.917 --> 40:24.919
Ray Rollins is attempting to sync
the plane's navigation systems.

40:24.921 --> 40:29.357
<i>We may be able to land
the Descartes remotely.</i>

40:29.359 --> 40:31.892
<i>Acknowledged, Captain.
Keep me informed on progress.</i>

40:31.894 --> 40:33.194
<i>Over and out.</i>

40:33.196 --> 40:35.763
Now if I can just
assign them

40:35.765 --> 40:38.202
our navigation signature...

40:40.136 --> 40:41.435
Error?

40:41.437 --> 40:45.105
Let's try it again.
Come on, Rollins.

40:45.107 --> 40:48.879
If I can assign them a new
call sign, that might work.

40:53.048 --> 40:54.749
All right! We just need
to match signatures.

40:54.751 --> 40:56.651
Can you call ATC?

40:56.653 --> 40:59.854
Yeah.
Copy that, copy that.

40:59.856 --> 41:02.957
Tower, Charlie, Zero, 117.

41:02.959 --> 41:04.725
<i>117, go ahead.</i>

41:04.727 --> 41:06.194
You're on, you're on, go.

41:06.196 --> 41:09.763
Tower, protocol niner-niner
golf November omega.

41:09.765 --> 41:12.433
Clearance 12623.

41:12.435 --> 41:16.837
Romeo tango foxtrot 001.

41:16.839 --> 41:18.638
Roger, activation code

41:18.640 --> 41:23.312
MLGB1328.

41:30.354 --> 41:33.390
There!
We are synchronized.

41:43.966 --> 41:44.966
What's happened?

41:44.968 --> 41:46.234
I lose control!

41:46.236 --> 41:47.569
What do you mean,
you lost control?

41:47.571 --> 41:49.504
To the Americans?

41:49.506 --> 41:51.404
I don't know.
I was flying fine!

41:51.406 --> 41:52.906
Just like that,
I have no control!

41:52.908 --> 41:55.944
- You got it?
- Try it.

41:55.946 --> 41:57.080
All right.
Hang tight.

42:23.372 --> 42:24.372
Rollins...

42:25.607 --> 42:27.674
I don't understand.
Is this a malfunction?

42:27.676 --> 42:29.276
It can't be malfunction.

42:29.278 --> 42:31.511
I've never seen malfunction
like this in my life!

42:31.513 --> 42:32.915
Then what?

42:36.153 --> 42:38.752
Feels like maybe... Zolotov.

42:38.754 --> 42:40.354
No. It couldn't be.

42:40.356 --> 42:42.589
It has to be the Americans.

42:42.591 --> 42:43.993
Has to be that airliner.

42:45.394 --> 42:48.529
I can't believe it. It worked!

42:48.531 --> 42:49.633
Sure looks like it.

42:51.167 --> 42:53.334
Mack, you tell them
the news for me?

42:53.336 --> 42:55.972
Yeah.

42:57.140 --> 42:59.640
We need more data
computer terminals!

42:59.642 --> 43:04.845
Brute force, that's all we have
and we're running out of time.

43:04.847 --> 43:06.680
General Hayes,
this is Captain Elliott.

43:06.682 --> 43:08.049
Yes, Captain?

43:08.051 --> 43:10.250
We patched through.
We are now synced in.

43:10.252 --> 43:14.589
We're remotely
controlling the other plane.

43:14.591 --> 43:15.723
Acknowledged!

43:15.725 --> 43:17.125
Get those planes on the ground

43:17.127 --> 43:18.825
before they figure
out a work-around.

43:18.827 --> 43:20.861
Well done, Captain.

43:20.863 --> 43:22.629
Copy that, copy that.

43:22.631 --> 43:24.999
We are now looking for
a place to land two planes.

43:25.001 --> 43:27.968
Mack, Mack...

43:27.970 --> 43:28.970
What do we got, Mack?

43:28.972 --> 43:30.203
All yours now.

43:30.205 --> 43:31.772
Get me a place
to land pretty quickly.

43:31.774 --> 43:32.807
- Uh-huh.
- Yes, Captain.

43:32.809 --> 43:34.174
Shall I start with airports?

43:34.176 --> 43:35.676
No, we don't have time
for airports.

43:35.678 --> 43:39.279
We need interstates, highways,
farmland, anything.

43:39.281 --> 43:40.381
We do not have time.

43:40.383 --> 43:41.383
All right, all right, all right.

43:41.385 --> 43:43.185
Um, let me see, let me see.

43:44.955 --> 43:46.254
We got some farmland
right up ahead.

43:46.256 --> 43:47.958
All right, that'll work.

43:52.694 --> 43:54.562
General Hayes,
we've synced navigation systems

43:54.564 --> 43:55.796
with the Descartes.

43:55.798 --> 43:58.265
All right, we're going
to land both planes now.

43:58.267 --> 43:59.936
Sending coordinates.

44:09.178 --> 44:11.645
Dispatch first responders now!

44:11.647 --> 44:14.281
Make sure law enforcement
seizes the hijackers

44:14.283 --> 44:15.649
personally at once.

44:15.651 --> 44:17.987
They need to be
analyzed immediately.

44:33.336 --> 44:36.473
We're coming in to land?
How did they get control?

44:37.707 --> 44:40.274
<i>All assets deployed
to location.</i>

44:40.276 --> 44:42.642
<i>Good luck bringing
that plane down. Out.</i>

44:42.644 --> 44:44.011
Thank you, General.

44:44.013 --> 44:45.479
Mack, would you please talk
to the passengers for me?

44:45.481 --> 44:47.117
I have got to focus on this.

44:49.051 --> 44:51.218
<i>Attention, passengers.
This is First Officer Mack.</i>

44:51.220 --> 44:53.587
<i>And we are going to land
the two planes.</i>

44:53.589 --> 44:55.890
<i>So I'm going to need you all
to stow all your belongings</i>

44:55.892 --> 44:57.227
and fasten your seatbelts.

45:08.071 --> 45:10.107
Looks like we're
landing on a farm!

45:13.843 --> 45:16.276
Viktor, do something!

45:16.278 --> 45:18.279
Yulia, get control of yourself!

45:18.281 --> 45:20.080
Our sacrifices will
be for nothing!

45:20.082 --> 45:22.883
We must do something!

45:22.885 --> 45:25.720
Cut the power!
Anything.

45:25.722 --> 45:26.689
We can't cut power!

45:28.057 --> 45:30.526
We will reboot the plane
in mid air.

45:37.767 --> 45:39.232
What's going on?

45:39.234 --> 45:41.269
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

45:41.271 --> 45:42.406
We've lost sync!

45:44.606 --> 45:46.908
Oh God, we're locked
in a nose dive.

45:46.910 --> 45:50.410
It'll take about 60 seconds
before we can reboot the plane.

45:50.412 --> 45:52.748
Keep your nerve, Viktor.

45:59.488 --> 46:02.626
Hey! They're dropping
out of the sky?

46:04.193 --> 46:05.461
What happened?

46:08.698 --> 46:09.562
They're gone!

46:09.564 --> 46:10.899
What do you mean, they're gone?

46:10.901 --> 46:12.435
I mean, their signal, it's gone!

46:15.705 --> 46:17.607
30 seconds.

46:26.115 --> 46:28.683
Wait. We were just hooked up
to the navigation system!

46:28.685 --> 46:30.584
So that means that
they cut the power!

46:30.586 --> 46:31.819
They killed the whole system!

46:31.821 --> 46:35.055
Shit.
All right, well... hang on.

46:35.057 --> 46:37.760
Just stand by.

46:42.064 --> 46:43.200
Shit.

46:49.939 --> 46:51.971
Viktor, reboot!

46:51.973 --> 46:53.073
Rebooting.

46:53.075 --> 46:54.778
We don't have much time.

46:56.946 --> 47:00.247
It's not working.

47:00.249 --> 47:04.218
It needs to cycle again
before the next attempt.

47:04.220 --> 47:06.687
If we can't take back control,

47:06.689 --> 47:09.790
this all would have
been for nothing.

47:09.792 --> 47:11.424
No, the sync is off.
We're pulling up.

47:11.426 --> 47:12.426
What? Captain, no!
Come on!

47:12.428 --> 47:13.928
We're so close!

47:13.930 --> 47:15.432
If we don't pull up
right now, we will crash.

47:16.798 --> 47:18.598
Let me just see if
I can resync the system.

47:18.600 --> 47:20.466
- You better work quick, Rollins.
- I'm trying.

47:20.468 --> 47:22.271
- Come on.
- You got 10 seconds.

47:25.006 --> 47:27.309
Now!

47:30.113 --> 47:32.613
We have power. We have power!

47:32.615 --> 47:34.082
Pull up!

47:34.084 --> 47:36.783
Pulling up.

48:05.013 --> 48:06.582
Pulling up, pulling up!

48:13.122 --> 48:15.022
Damn it!

48:15.024 --> 48:16.723
It's not pulling up on the menu.

48:16.725 --> 48:18.292
It's like the plane's
not even there.

48:18.294 --> 48:20.627
Come on, Ray. Think!

48:20.629 --> 48:23.497
Okay, the nav software
is triggered upon takeoff.

48:23.499 --> 48:24.631
You have five seconds!

48:24.633 --> 48:25.899
- So-so-so...
- Come on, time!

48:25.901 --> 48:27.500
They recycled!

48:27.502 --> 48:29.035
If they rebooted the software,

48:29.037 --> 48:30.904
the computer doesn't think
the plane ever took off.

48:30.906 --> 48:32.973
And if they never took off,
then it can't be in the air.

48:32.975 --> 48:34.142
Exactly.

48:34.144 --> 48:35.843
Any other ideas?

48:35.845 --> 48:38.279
Anything at all?

48:38.281 --> 48:39.549
I don't.

48:40.950 --> 48:42.216
All right, well, why don't
you go back to the cabin

48:42.218 --> 48:43.917
and keep the passengers calm.

48:43.919 --> 48:46.419
If the plane shows back up on
the monitor, we'll let you know.

48:46.421 --> 48:48.557
- All right?
- Gonna call the Pentagon.

48:50.559 --> 48:52.058
- We got it.
- Gentlemen.

48:52.060 --> 48:54.231
We got it, we got it.
We're good, we're good.

49:03.305 --> 49:05.171
They're getting away again!

49:05.173 --> 49:06.842
I don't see 'em.

49:13.450 --> 49:14.881
What is it?

49:14.883 --> 49:16.283
What'd you try?

49:16.285 --> 49:17.419
Didn't work.

49:18.521 --> 49:19.955
So what's the plan?

49:22.057 --> 49:23.425
We're brainstorming.

49:25.528 --> 49:27.828
Where do you
think we're flying at?

49:27.830 --> 49:31.198
10,000 feet?

49:31.200 --> 49:33.901
Yeah.
I think about 10,000 feet.

49:33.903 --> 49:35.067
That seems right.

49:35.069 --> 49:36.203
Now just hear me out.

49:36.205 --> 49:37.440
I skydived out of...

49:39.475 --> 49:42.176
dozens of planes
as a teenager.

49:42.178 --> 49:45.245
I'm gonna skydive onto
that hijacked airliner.

49:46.881 --> 49:48.883
I'm gonna find a way and
I'm gonna kill those hijackers.

49:48.885 --> 49:49.984
You got me, Marshal?

49:49.986 --> 49:52.618
Look, Logan.
I appreciate your bravery.

49:52.620 --> 49:54.453
But even if you were
somehow miraculously able

49:54.455 --> 49:56.256
to land on that plane,

49:56.258 --> 49:58.591
there's no way you'd survive
the impact of the fall, okay?

49:58.593 --> 50:00.664
You'd be like a cannonball
falling from the sky.

50:02.231 --> 50:05.332
Wouldn't a cannonball take
out a passenger airliner?

50:05.334 --> 50:07.734
There's millions of
lives at stake.

50:07.736 --> 50:09.604
I'm willing to make that
ultimate sacrifice, guys.

50:09.606 --> 50:11.104
- Logan...
- Are you?

50:11.106 --> 50:13.073
We are not going to let you
jump out of the plane

50:13.075 --> 50:15.109
on a suicide mission!

50:15.111 --> 50:19.613
Even if you survive the landing,
how are you going to get inside?

50:19.615 --> 50:22.348
Well, he brings up
an excellent idea.

50:22.350 --> 50:24.384
Cannonballs sink ships.

50:24.386 --> 50:27.287
If you're in the 1800s.

50:27.289 --> 50:28.756
This is a dumb idea.

50:28.758 --> 50:29.823
Hey, look.

50:29.825 --> 50:31.292
If we're gonna take
out this plane,

50:31.294 --> 50:33.430
we need to start thinking
outside the box, okay?

50:35.564 --> 50:37.464
Now everyone's seen
a bird, right?

50:37.466 --> 50:39.433
They're small,
lightweight and fluffy.

50:39.435 --> 50:42.703
Feathers, they've been known
to take out airplanes.

50:42.705 --> 50:46.573
If we had something heavy
or something more solid,

50:46.575 --> 50:48.341
we could do some
really serious damage.

50:48.343 --> 50:50.477
You're right.

50:50.479 --> 50:53.781
So let's just use our cannons
to launch cannonballs at them.

50:53.783 --> 50:55.515
You're not hearing me.

50:55.517 --> 50:57.750
We don't need a cannon if
we're using gravitational forces

50:57.752 --> 50:59.486
to propel our projectiles.

50:59.488 --> 51:02.990
What you're saying is, if we get
something like a dumb missile,

51:02.992 --> 51:04.926
something without
explosives, right?

51:04.928 --> 51:05.959
Right.

51:05.961 --> 51:07.394
So what do we have on
this plane

51:07.396 --> 51:09.899
that we could use as
a projectile?

51:12.135 --> 51:13.834
I have an idea.

51:13.836 --> 51:15.134
What is it?

51:15.136 --> 51:17.671
Well, it's sort of a joke
among flight attendants

51:17.673 --> 51:20.573
that the service trolleys
are dangerous weapons.

51:20.575 --> 51:21.607
Service trolleys.

51:21.609 --> 51:23.676
The beverage carts.

51:23.678 --> 51:26.412
- Yeah, that's it!
- Yeah.

51:26.414 --> 51:27.413
That just might work.

51:27.415 --> 51:29.116
Yeah? Shall I get them?

51:29.118 --> 51:30.484
Hold on! Hold on!

51:30.486 --> 51:32.218
Are you kidding me?

51:32.220 --> 51:36.522
We'll all be sucked out the door
or die from the pressure.

51:36.524 --> 51:38.959
Will the door even open?

51:38.961 --> 51:43.663
Look, both planes are now
well under 10,000 feet.

51:43.665 --> 51:45.868
It's possible,
I've done it before.

51:49.171 --> 51:51.772
Okay. We have three carts
on the plane.

51:51.774 --> 51:54.073
Great.
Load 'em as heavy as you can.

51:54.075 --> 51:55.709
I'm gonna go let
the pilot know

51:55.711 --> 51:57.178
that he needs to fly
right over the Descartes.

51:57.180 --> 51:59.649
- Right.
- Great idea!

52:55.403 --> 52:57.504
The pilots are on board.
Just talked through the phone.

52:57.506 --> 52:58.641
- Okay.
- Okay.

53:00.176 --> 53:02.375
He's going to make the call,
but it's gonna be loud.

53:02.377 --> 53:04.511
So he's going to radio you
through the phone.

53:04.513 --> 53:06.216
I'm gonna go on your mark.

53:07.515 --> 53:09.049
I talked to the pilots.

53:09.051 --> 53:10.584
Captain Elliott said he's gonna
make an announcement

53:10.586 --> 53:14.055
as soon as
he's in position. 'Kay?

53:14.057 --> 53:17.260
We've descended enough.
The cabin pressure's stabilized.

53:18.260 --> 53:20.394
Copy that.

53:20.396 --> 53:24.730
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please remain in your seats</i>

53:24.732 --> 53:26.700
<i>keep your
seatbelt fastened...</i>

53:26.702 --> 53:32.074
as we prepare to open
the emergency exit door momentarily.

53:39.048 --> 53:42.183
They're coming back
around again.

53:42.185 --> 53:45.519
We've rebooted,
they can't sync with us.

53:45.521 --> 53:47.821
Mr. Rollins, we're in position.

53:47.823 --> 53:49.723
Hold on, everybody!

53:49.725 --> 53:51.591
The pressure of the entire plane
is about to change,

53:51.593 --> 53:53.060
so we need to be careful!

53:53.062 --> 53:54.895
If you don't need to be here,

53:54.897 --> 53:56.930
I want you to move to the back
section of the plane now!

53:56.932 --> 53:59.366
I'm gonna go help!

53:59.368 --> 54:01.571
Noah, stay!

54:02.972 --> 54:04.437
Fine.

54:04.439 --> 54:06.575
We're come too far
to fail the mission.

54:15.984 --> 54:16.984
Ready?

54:16.986 --> 54:18.252
- Ready, Ray.
- Uh-huh.

54:18.254 --> 54:19.789
Here we go.

54:29.298 --> 54:31.698
I'm not gonna have to worry
about you trying to jump, am I?

54:31.700 --> 54:34.000
No, sir!
I like this idea a lot better.

54:34.002 --> 54:35.201
- Let's go!
- Right!

54:35.203 --> 54:36.573
Let's go!

54:42.444 --> 54:44.144
Cart number one is in position!

54:44.146 --> 54:48.314
All right, we're gonna drop
in three, two, one, drop it!

54:48.316 --> 54:49.751
Go!

54:57.459 --> 54:58.761
Damn it!

55:01.564 --> 55:03.129
We were close?

55:03.131 --> 55:06.265
We can't miss again!
Second cart.

55:06.267 --> 55:07.336
Come on!

55:08.836 --> 55:10.205
Aim for the engine!

55:12.341 --> 55:13.741
Deploying cart number two!

55:13.743 --> 55:15.575
Okay.

55:15.577 --> 55:18.377
Now we go in three, two, one...

55:18.379 --> 55:19.915
- <i>Drop it!</i>
- And go!

55:29.258 --> 55:30.323
Hit!

55:34.430 --> 55:35.962
What was that?

55:35.964 --> 55:39.299
The left engine
has been damaged!

55:39.301 --> 55:41.069
What caused it?

55:43.606 --> 55:45.975
Reroute the power
to compensate.

55:51.446 --> 55:53.946
Left engine's up.

55:53.948 --> 55:56.616
Back at 50% and speed

55:56.618 --> 56:00.720
approaching 300
kilometers per hour.

56:00.722 --> 56:02.589
Well done, Viktor.

56:02.591 --> 56:04.058
I'll give it to them.

56:04.060 --> 56:06.696
They may be weak,
but they're trying.

56:07.796 --> 56:09.162
I think if we can
get the trolley

56:09.164 --> 56:10.564
to punch a hole
through their wing

56:10.566 --> 56:12.301
we might be able to
take 'em out completely!

56:14.836 --> 56:16.271
Okay, third cart!

56:17.406 --> 56:19.908
This is our last cart.
Make it count.

56:21.042 --> 56:23.178
Let's go, guys.
Come on!

56:29.051 --> 56:30.383
Okay.

56:30.385 --> 56:33.720
We're gonna go at three,
two, one, drop it!

56:33.722 --> 56:34.857
Go!

56:42.196 --> 56:43.196
We did it!

56:45.167 --> 56:46.235
We did it!

56:52.642 --> 56:54.174
Yulia!

56:54.176 --> 56:55.508
Viktor!

56:55.510 --> 56:57.511
We can't make it!
We can't make it!

57:16.265 --> 57:17.433
Get over here!

57:19.568 --> 57:21.468
Good job, everybody!

57:21.470 --> 57:22.839
Good job!

57:25.073 --> 57:28.908
We're going down.

57:28.910 --> 57:31.877
Yulia, this could be
the end for us.

57:31.879 --> 57:34.647
You can do it!
What would Zolotov say?

57:34.649 --> 57:36.116
Everyone has to play their part

57:36.118 --> 57:38.618
and your part is to fly
this plane right now.

57:38.620 --> 57:39.955
Get control!

57:41.557 --> 57:43.189
I will get control.

57:43.191 --> 57:46.359
I will get control...
for the family!

57:46.361 --> 57:48.062
For the family!

57:48.064 --> 57:49.863
- Never forgotten!
- Never forgotten!

57:49.865 --> 57:51.466
Never!

58:13.988 --> 58:15.022
<i>General Hayes?</i>

58:15.024 --> 58:16.689
Yes, Captain?

58:16.691 --> 58:18.591
<i>General, we dropped service
carts onto the Descartes</i>

58:18.593 --> 58:20.560
<i>and punched a hole
in their left wing.</i>

58:20.562 --> 58:24.631
<i>I saw them lose altitude fast.
I think it worked.</i>

58:24.633 --> 58:25.799
Yeah!

58:25.801 --> 58:27.133
Okay, good work, everyone!

58:27.135 --> 58:28.535
What do you say we
get back to our seats

58:28.537 --> 58:30.502
and fasten our seatbelts?

58:30.504 --> 58:31.504
Come here.

58:31.506 --> 58:33.040
My God.

58:33.042 --> 58:35.174
I still can't believe
that that worked.

58:35.176 --> 58:37.377
Come on. Let's get back
to our seat, babe.

58:37.379 --> 58:38.347
We did it.

58:40.582 --> 58:43.116
Come on, babe. I just need to
grab something from my bag.

58:43.118 --> 58:45.519
What could you possibly need
from your bag right now?

58:45.521 --> 58:47.120
I got to get something.

58:47.122 --> 58:48.254
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, this is
your captain speaking.</i>

58:48.256 --> 58:49.522
<i>The Descartes is dropping.</i>

58:49.524 --> 58:51.524
I repeat, the Descartes
is dropping.

58:51.526 --> 58:54.461
<i>Once we have confirmation
of the crashing,</i>

58:54.463 --> 58:55.662
<i>we'll get you on the ground.</i>

58:57.665 --> 58:59.368
Thank God.

59:00.468 --> 59:02.403
Great job, everyone!

59:02.405 --> 59:04.671
But we should wait for
the official confirmation.

59:04.673 --> 59:06.638
I think you saw what I did.

59:06.640 --> 59:10.343
I mean, that's confirmation
enough, right, guys?

59:10.345 --> 59:11.745
Yeah.

59:11.747 --> 59:13.316
Yeah, well, I'll wait for
the official word myself.

59:37.640 --> 59:40.109
Wait 'til the guys hear
about this one!

59:41.477 --> 59:43.776
Babe... I love you.

59:43.778 --> 59:44.778
I love you, too.

59:44.780 --> 59:46.515
Come on.

59:49.051 --> 59:51.285
I knew we were gonna wait
to get married...

59:51.287 --> 59:53.986
But I don't think there's
a better time than now.

59:55.457 --> 59:59.526
We... we saved millions
of peoples' lives.

01:00:00.696 --> 01:00:04.330
- And... Elizabeth Cartwright?
- Babe, come on.

01:00:04.332 --> 01:00:05.401
Will you?

01:00:06.767 --> 01:00:08.000
Oh, no.

01:00:08.002 --> 01:00:10.238
Guys? Guys!

01:00:11.973 --> 01:00:13.473
They're back!

01:00:13.475 --> 01:00:15.111
Look, look.

01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:20.312
That thing went right
through the wing!

01:00:20.314 --> 01:00:22.117
How are they still in the air?

01:00:27.321 --> 01:00:29.221
Ladies and gentlemen,
as you may have seen,

01:00:29.223 --> 01:00:31.790
the Descartes is still
on course for D.C.

01:00:31.792 --> 01:00:33.359
We have 20 minutes.

01:00:33.361 --> 01:00:36.062
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.

01:00:36.064 --> 01:00:37.397
How are they
still in the air?

01:00:37.399 --> 01:00:40.200
Not to be the bearer of
more bad news, guys.

01:00:40.202 --> 01:00:41.868
But if we keep going,
there's probably not gonna

01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:44.604
be enough time for us to get
away from the nuclear blast!

01:00:44.606 --> 01:00:46.140
What? Oh, my God.

01:00:46.142 --> 01:00:47.774
It's too dangerous
for us to keep going!

01:00:47.776 --> 01:00:49.144
Oh, my God.

01:00:56.151 --> 01:00:59.151
People, stay calm, okay?

01:00:59.153 --> 01:01:01.289
I'll be right back.

01:01:08.363 --> 01:01:09.830
- Captain?
- I don't know.

01:01:09.832 --> 01:01:11.365
- Captain?
- I don't know, I don't know.

01:01:11.367 --> 01:01:12.698
I don't know either.

01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:14.700
We must have missed
the control leakage!

01:01:14.702 --> 01:01:16.236
Call the General, sir.

01:01:16.238 --> 01:01:17.870
- Yeah, the...
- Hang on.

01:01:17.872 --> 01:01:21.508
Shit! Shit!

01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:24.213
Open channel!
Open channel!

01:01:26.948 --> 01:01:30.383
General Hayes, this is
Captain Elliott speaking.

01:01:30.385 --> 01:01:32.488
Captain! What's the status?

01:01:34.222 --> 01:01:40.060
The status is the projectile
gambit was unsuccessful.

01:01:40.062 --> 01:01:42.662
It made impact, but not
enough to bring it down.

01:01:42.664 --> 01:01:44.698
You need to get your
people out of there.

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:46.366
Go to Massachusetts.

01:01:46.368 --> 01:01:49.836
We have a team in place
waiting to minimize the effect

01:01:49.838 --> 01:01:51.837
of the nuclear fallout.

01:01:51.839 --> 01:01:53.372
Sit tight.

01:01:53.374 --> 01:01:55.077
I have another idea.

01:01:57.511 --> 01:01:58.611
Collision.

01:01:58.613 --> 01:02:00.946
The Descartes
has a damaged wing.

01:02:00.948 --> 01:02:02.448
It won't handle the impact.

01:02:02.450 --> 01:02:05.819
<i>I won't let you fly
a suicide mission!</i>

01:02:05.821 --> 01:02:08.520
Sir, no one's saying suicide.
Listen. Just hear me out.

01:02:08.522 --> 01:02:11.258
I'm not talking kamikaze.
Just trust me on this.

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:13.192
<i>Captain!</i>

01:02:13.194 --> 01:02:17.462
<i>Sir, look,
I am absolutely sure</i>

01:02:17.464 --> 01:02:21.634
<i>that I can collide without
making a crash, okay?</i>

01:02:21.636 --> 01:02:25.004
As big as this damn bird,
all's we do is just nudge her.

01:02:25.006 --> 01:02:26.305
Just nudge her just a tad,

01:02:26.307 --> 01:02:28.774
but she will go down,
I guarantee it.

01:02:28.776 --> 01:02:31.276
Sir, they have a damaged engine
and a damaged wing

01:02:31.278 --> 01:02:33.312
<i>and who knows what else?</i>

01:02:33.314 --> 01:02:34.848
<i>They're not at full strength.</i>

01:02:34.850 --> 01:02:37.917
What's the status of
the anti-virus?

01:02:37.919 --> 01:02:40.386
We have 98 terminals dedicated

01:02:40.388 --> 01:02:42.455
to brute forcing
the permissions.

01:02:42.457 --> 01:02:44.756
But haven't succeeded.

01:02:44.758 --> 01:02:50.497
I'm trying.
It could be hours, maybe days.

01:02:50.499 --> 01:02:51.734
Sorry.

01:02:53.334 --> 01:02:55.636
You can do this successfully?

01:02:55.638 --> 01:02:57.540
Yes. Yes, sir.
Yes, I can.

01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:03.712
Don't make me regret this.

01:03:04.946 --> 01:03:06.115
God speed.

01:03:08.749 --> 01:03:09.751
Over and out.

01:03:15.857 --> 01:03:19.292
- Rollins?
- Sir?

01:03:19.294 --> 01:03:21.261
You're gonna
want to head back.

01:03:21.263 --> 01:03:22.565
It's gonna get rough.

01:03:27.035 --> 01:03:28.370
Good luck.

01:03:40.883 --> 01:03:42.482
Okay.

01:03:42.484 --> 01:03:45.785
Sorry about earlier, putting
you on the spot and all?

01:03:45.787 --> 01:03:47.789
I mean, I was gonna wait 'til
we got to your parents, but...

01:03:50.725 --> 01:03:52.825
I don't know
much in this world.

01:03:52.827 --> 01:03:54.129
But I do know I love you.

01:03:55.296 --> 01:03:56.895
I love you, too.

01:03:56.897 --> 01:04:00.332
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.</i>

01:04:00.334 --> 01:04:01.767
<i>We're running
out of time and options.</i>

01:04:01.769 --> 01:04:04.770
<i>At this point,
the only option that we have</i>

01:04:04.772 --> 01:04:06.541
is to collide with
the other plane.

01:04:08.542 --> 01:04:11.310
<i>I'm not talking kamikaze.</i>

01:04:11.312 --> 01:04:12.345
<i>It's just not
gonna be a suicide.</i>

01:04:12.347 --> 01:04:14.180
Trust me on this.

01:04:14.182 --> 01:04:17.850
It's more of a slight nudge
that we will be doing.

01:04:17.852 --> 01:04:20.520
Trust me.

01:04:20.522 --> 01:04:23.557
<i>What I need you to do
right now is stay calm.</i>

01:04:23.559 --> 01:04:26.794
Return to your seat,
fasten your seatbelt.

01:04:28.263 --> 01:04:29.565
We're gonna get through this.

01:04:39.874 --> 01:04:43.646
We're gonna go in
three, two, one.

01:04:48.816 --> 01:04:52.854
♪ O'er the land
of the free ♪

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:03.763
As we suspected, here
they come for another round.

01:05:03.765 --> 01:05:05.233
Predictable.

01:05:06.734 --> 01:05:08.937
There. I see it.

01:05:21.816 --> 01:05:23.450
What are you doing?

01:05:23.452 --> 01:05:25.185
Don't let them get close!

01:05:25.187 --> 01:05:27.053
Well, we've taken
too much damage!

01:05:27.055 --> 01:05:28.654
I cannot outfly it!

01:05:28.656 --> 01:05:32.560
Perhaps if we drop,
I can buy us a little time.

01:05:36.564 --> 01:05:37.964
This better work.

01:05:37.966 --> 01:05:38.999
It'll work, it'll work.

01:05:39.001 --> 01:05:40.100
There's that turbulence.

01:05:40.102 --> 01:05:41.870
Yeah, it's only gonna get worse.

01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:52.178
The plane sounds like
it's ripping apart!

01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:53.745
I'm gonna be sick!

01:05:53.747 --> 01:05:55.314
I've never felt turbulence
like this!

01:05:55.316 --> 01:05:56.651
Here we go.

01:06:00.222 --> 01:06:01.624
Brace for impact!

01:06:14.102 --> 01:06:15.968
Hold on.

01:06:29.084 --> 01:06:30.519
Ah!

01:06:39.294 --> 01:06:41.461
You got it!

01:06:41.463 --> 01:06:43.029
I think it's his arm!

01:06:43.031 --> 01:06:45.165
- I think it's his arm!
- Ow, my arm!

01:06:48.336 --> 01:06:51.004
It's broken!
It's broken!

01:06:51.006 --> 01:06:52.971
I'm an ER nurse back in L.A.!
Can I take a look at it?

01:06:52.973 --> 01:06:56.042
I won't be able to
climb for months!

01:06:56.044 --> 01:06:57.676
Okay. It seems like
a relatively clean break.

01:06:57.678 --> 01:06:58.877
But I can splint
a clean break.

01:06:58.879 --> 01:07:00.879
- Logan...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:07:00.881 --> 01:07:02.582
Oh, God!

01:07:02.584 --> 01:07:04.651
Can you get your tie off
with your other arm?

01:07:04.653 --> 01:07:05.718
Ah!

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:09.189
Hey, hey.
It's okay. All right.

01:07:09.191 --> 01:07:11.426
I'll just get around.
Gonna wrap it around.

01:07:13.461 --> 01:07:14.828
Here we go.
It's not perfect, but,

01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:18.598
it should hold up until
we get on the ground.

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:20.602
- Thank you.
- Just hold still.

01:07:27.274 --> 01:07:29.341
We've taken more damage.

01:07:29.343 --> 01:07:33.046
But we're still on course
for Calvert Cliffs.

01:07:33.048 --> 01:07:36.082
The Descartes is still
in the air.

01:07:36.084 --> 01:07:37.316
What about Zolotov's
signal locator?

01:07:37.318 --> 01:07:38.850
Status?

01:07:38.852 --> 01:07:41.053
The task force has arrived
at Zolotov's signal.

01:07:41.055 --> 01:07:42.724
They're requesting
the go-ahead.

01:07:44.059 --> 01:07:47.493
Any anomalies?
Reason for suspicion?

01:07:47.495 --> 01:07:48.794
Negative.

01:07:48.796 --> 01:07:50.430
General?

01:07:50.432 --> 01:07:53.098
Give them the green light.

01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:54.567
Acknowledged.

01:07:54.569 --> 01:07:57.270
Tell them to take every
single hard drive they see.

01:07:57.272 --> 01:07:59.872
If brute force won't work,
it's critical

01:07:59.874 --> 01:08:02.274
that we find the source code
to this virus.

01:08:02.276 --> 01:08:03.875
Yes, ma'am.

01:08:03.877 --> 01:08:06.414
Just how confident are you that
Zolotov is in that building?

01:08:08.450 --> 01:08:10.950
I can say
that's where his signal

01:08:10.952 --> 01:08:14.589
is being transmitted
with 93% certainty.

01:08:16.756 --> 01:08:19.291
Tell the soldiers
to watch out for an ambush.

01:08:19.292 --> 01:08:21.428
Something smells fishy.

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:23.228
Tread carefully.

01:08:23.229 --> 01:08:24.599
Yes, sir.

01:09:08.408 --> 01:09:10.843
He knew we were coming.

01:09:10.845 --> 01:09:12.846
Get General Hayes
on the horn now.

01:09:54.254 --> 01:09:56.656
Skydive.

01:09:56.658 --> 01:09:58.256
Guys, look.

01:09:58.258 --> 01:10:02.696
The emergency exit door was
blown off during the collision.

01:10:02.698 --> 01:10:04.930
I can skydive down into it.

01:10:04.932 --> 01:10:05.934
No.

01:10:08.971 --> 01:10:11.670
No, no, no.
We already talked about this.

01:10:11.672 --> 01:10:12.904
That's almost certain death.

01:10:12.906 --> 01:10:14.607
Ray, what's the difference

01:10:14.609 --> 01:10:16.643
if I die here or I die over
there, huh?

01:10:16.645 --> 01:10:18.510
You're not jumping!

01:10:18.512 --> 01:10:20.045
I don't see any other choice.

01:10:20.047 --> 01:10:22.616
Well, can we all just
think for a minute?

01:10:22.618 --> 01:10:24.384
Yeah.

01:10:24.386 --> 01:10:26.484
What about rope?

01:10:26.486 --> 01:10:27.756
What rope?

01:10:28.789 --> 01:10:30.624
I have my rock climbing gear.

01:10:30.626 --> 01:10:33.095
We can lower him down
into the open door.

01:10:37.498 --> 01:10:39.733
That could work.
Tie me up.

01:10:39.735 --> 01:10:41.134
Okay, if we're gonna do this,
we need to go.

01:10:41.136 --> 01:10:42.635
Ma'am, if you don't
want to watch,

01:10:42.637 --> 01:10:44.002
you can sit
in the back of the plane.

01:10:44.004 --> 01:10:46.938
That's not what
I'm trying to argue!

01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:49.776
Is this happening
no matter what I say?

01:10:49.778 --> 01:10:51.844
I think so.

01:10:51.846 --> 01:10:53.380
But I'd feel
a hell of a lot better

01:10:53.382 --> 01:10:54.750
with you here with me, okay?

01:10:56.784 --> 01:10:58.718
- Okay?
- Yeah, I know.

01:10:58.720 --> 01:10:59.785
But let me help.

01:10:59.787 --> 01:11:01.955
Just walk me through it.

01:11:01.957 --> 01:11:03.156
I used to tie knots
in Girl Scouts.

01:11:03.158 --> 01:11:04.657
Okay.

01:11:04.659 --> 01:11:06.626
- I'm gonna go tell the pilots.
- Okay.

01:11:06.628 --> 01:11:08.697
Something tells me they're
gonna need some convincing!

01:11:12.232 --> 01:11:13.599
Captain!

01:11:13.601 --> 01:11:15.367
Ray, what do you got?
We've only got 10 minutes.

01:11:15.369 --> 01:11:17.569
That collision blew
the emergency door right off.

01:11:17.571 --> 01:11:19.237
There's a hole in the Descartes!

01:11:19.239 --> 01:11:23.341
Now we wanna lower a passenger,
a fireman, down on a rope, okay?

01:11:23.343 --> 01:11:25.178
We just need you to position
the plane, sir,

01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:26.845
so he could crawl through the
opening and retake the aircraft.

01:11:26.847 --> 01:11:28.413
Ray, you have got
to be kidding me!

01:11:28.415 --> 01:11:30.116
I thought we were threading
a needle before!

01:11:30.118 --> 01:11:32.018
Wait. They've taken
more damage than we have.

01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:34.623
Look, this is our last shot.
We have to take it.

01:11:35.556 --> 01:11:38.124
Sir?

01:11:38.126 --> 01:11:39.061
Captain?

01:11:43.097 --> 01:11:44.196
The left door?

01:11:44.198 --> 01:11:45.663
Yes, sir.

01:11:45.665 --> 01:11:47.133
All right.

01:11:47.135 --> 01:11:48.800
We'll let you know
when we're in position.

01:11:48.802 --> 01:11:50.335
Pull that one tight.

01:11:50.337 --> 01:11:52.103
Yeah, okay. Got it!

01:11:52.105 --> 01:11:55.508
Like that. Good, good.
Should be good.

01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:57.713
- Okay.
- Should be good.

01:11:58.712 --> 01:12:00.181
- We're good?
- Yeah.

01:12:02.717 --> 01:12:04.050
Should be good.

01:12:04.052 --> 01:12:05.852
Did I hear
we're good to go?

01:12:05.854 --> 01:12:06.852
Pilots ready?

01:12:06.854 --> 01:12:08.323
They're in position.

01:12:15.863 --> 01:12:17.697
Babe, if I don't make it...

01:12:17.699 --> 01:12:19.465
Don't talk like that.

01:12:19.467 --> 01:12:23.368
Hey, look at me, look at me.
I love you, okay?

01:12:23.370 --> 01:12:25.804
I know.
I love you, too.

01:12:25.806 --> 01:12:27.173
And, yes!

01:12:27.175 --> 01:12:28.474
Yes to what?

01:12:28.476 --> 01:12:30.009
I didn't give you an answer
to your proposal.

01:12:30.011 --> 01:12:31.243
Yes, of course,
I will marry you.

01:12:31.245 --> 01:12:33.846
- Yeah?
- Yes.

01:12:33.848 --> 01:12:35.447
Guys, guys, hey.

01:12:35.449 --> 01:12:36.648
Sorry to interrupt,
but we're running out of time.

01:12:36.650 --> 01:12:38.818
One more for good luck?

01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:40.486
There's a lifetime
where those came from.

01:12:40.488 --> 01:12:42.721
Hopefully, a long time.

01:12:42.723 --> 01:12:44.059
You ready, Logan?

01:12:46.061 --> 01:12:47.626
Okay.

01:12:47.628 --> 01:12:50.130
Now look, there's no telling how
many hijackers are over there.

01:12:50.132 --> 01:12:51.630
You're gonna have
to assume that

01:12:51.632 --> 01:12:53.433
you're gonna be outnumbered
in a fight, okay?

01:12:53.435 --> 01:12:54.966
Okay.

01:12:54.968 --> 01:12:56.602
At a big time disadvantage,
you're gonna take this.

01:12:56.604 --> 01:12:57.972
You know how to use it?

01:12:59.074 --> 01:13:00.139
Secure that before the jump.

01:13:00.141 --> 01:13:02.308
You won't want to drop it.

01:13:02.310 --> 01:13:03.378
Thanks, Ray.

01:13:13.253 --> 01:13:15.955
- You ready?
- I'm ready!

01:13:15.957 --> 01:13:17.355
Turn around slowly!

01:13:17.357 --> 01:13:18.291
Step over the rope!

01:13:18.293 --> 01:13:20.059
Nice and easy!
Nice and easy!

01:13:20.061 --> 01:13:21.430
Watch your step!
Secure the rope!

01:13:26.467 --> 01:13:28.600
Liz?

01:13:28.602 --> 01:13:29.937
I'll see you on the ground.

01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:40.815
More slack!

01:13:47.556 --> 01:13:49.257
Slow! Slow!

01:13:51.758 --> 01:13:53.328
Come on!

01:14:15.083 --> 01:14:16.948
We need more weight, right?

01:14:16.950 --> 01:14:18.684
Do you know what you're doing?

01:14:18.686 --> 01:14:20.786
What's it look like I'm doing?

01:14:20.788 --> 01:14:22.891
All right.

01:14:26.461 --> 01:14:27.395
Okay.

01:14:29.329 --> 01:14:32.363
All right.
Will, I need your good hand!

01:14:32.365 --> 01:14:34.502
Pull this rope up!
Pick it up!

01:14:37.437 --> 01:14:39.807
Come on!

01:14:41.409 --> 01:14:42.444
Oh!

01:14:46.882 --> 01:14:48.383
Logan!

01:14:56.089 --> 01:14:57.258
Oh my God, they made it!

01:15:01.227 --> 01:15:03.431
- Hold on!
- Cut the rope!

01:15:09.037 --> 01:15:10.806
Hand me my gun.

01:15:12.039 --> 01:15:13.207
Come on, let's go.

01:15:20.914 --> 01:15:22.082
Call Zolotov!

01:15:35.829 --> 01:15:37.431
Viktor, they're on the plane.

01:15:44.806 --> 01:15:46.908
Rock the plane.

01:15:54.781 --> 01:15:56.349
Ray! You all right?

01:15:56.351 --> 01:15:57.385
Yeah!

01:16:09.364 --> 01:16:11.764
She cut me!

01:16:11.766 --> 01:16:13.435
Oh, yeah, that looks deep.

01:16:15.570 --> 01:16:20.175
This will lock collision course
with the power plant.

01:16:21.909 --> 01:16:23.111
Oh!

01:16:31.686 --> 01:16:32.952
Ray, you all right?

01:16:32.954 --> 01:16:34.289
Ray?

01:16:37.624 --> 01:16:39.657
Shoot him!

01:16:39.659 --> 01:16:40.725
Ray! Ray!

01:16:40.727 --> 01:16:42.694
- For family!
- Shoot this guy!

01:16:42.696 --> 01:16:43.998
Shoot this...

01:16:46.833 --> 01:16:48.535
Jesus Christ!

01:16:51.739 --> 01:16:52.938
Are you okay?

01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:54.005
I'll be fine.

01:16:54.007 --> 01:16:55.941
Let's land this plane.

01:16:55.943 --> 01:16:57.212
- Right.
- Come on

01:16:58.946 --> 01:17:00.147
Ah, she cut me.

01:17:07.821 --> 01:17:09.123
We're clear.

01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:11.322
Ever been in one of these?

01:17:11.324 --> 01:17:12.260
Yep.

01:17:13.494 --> 01:17:16.062
I've got to take control
of this aircraft.

01:17:16.064 --> 01:17:17.298
Get this bird on the ground.

01:17:18.365 --> 01:17:19.564
Okay.

01:17:19.566 --> 01:17:20.935
Whoa.

01:17:25.972 --> 01:17:27.372
I'm locked out!

01:17:27.374 --> 01:17:28.840
What do you mean,
you're locked out?

01:17:28.842 --> 01:17:31.010
I mean, the controls!
They're unresponsive!

01:17:31.012 --> 01:17:33.045
Try the radio.

01:17:33.047 --> 01:17:34.813
Go ahead.
Give it a shot.

01:17:34.815 --> 01:17:37.316
Huh?

01:17:37.318 --> 01:17:39.018
The com seems
to be unaffected.

01:17:40.355 --> 01:17:42.487
They forgot to lock the com!

01:17:42.489 --> 01:17:46.358
Here, hold on.
That's the emergency channel.

01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:48.728
Mayday! Mayday!
Is anyone out there?

01:17:48.730 --> 01:17:50.295
Over!

01:17:50.297 --> 01:17:51.496
Mayday! Mayday!
Is anyone out there?

01:17:51.498 --> 01:17:52.331
Over!

01:17:52.333 --> 01:17:56.068
Logan, is that you?

01:17:56.070 --> 01:17:59.071
Yeah. We made it.

01:17:59.073 --> 01:18:01.040
- You're alive?
- Yeah.

01:18:01.042 --> 01:18:02.677
I need to talk to Liz.
It's urgent.

01:18:04.779 --> 01:18:06.247
Yeah, stand by.

01:18:09.551 --> 01:18:11.649
<i>Liz?</i>

01:18:11.651 --> 01:18:15.187
Just wanna tell you
I love you so much.

01:18:15.189 --> 01:18:16.589
I'm sorry.

01:18:16.591 --> 01:18:17.590
Logan?

01:18:17.592 --> 01:18:18.727
I'm so sorry.

01:18:22.029 --> 01:18:23.461
What Logan's trying
to say is that

01:18:23.463 --> 01:18:25.197
we don't have control
of the aircraft.

01:18:25.199 --> 01:18:27.765
<i>We are completely
locked out of navigation.</i>

01:18:27.767 --> 01:18:29.434
As far as I can tell,

01:18:29.436 --> 01:18:32.339
it's headed directly for the
nuclear power plant. Over.

01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:37.343
We're within minutes of D.C.!

01:18:37.345 --> 01:18:38.810
There has to be something
that we can do!

01:18:38.812 --> 01:18:40.879
There has to be
something that we can do!

01:18:40.881 --> 01:18:42.281
It's over!

01:18:42.283 --> 01:18:43.549
All right, Ray.
I got you, I got you.

01:18:43.551 --> 01:18:47.385
Have you tried
cutting the autopilot?

01:18:47.387 --> 01:18:49.020
Yes, sir.
It won't disengage.

01:18:49.022 --> 01:18:50.389
All right.

01:18:50.391 --> 01:18:53.158
Well, have you tried
setting a new course?

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:54.328
I can't, sir.
It won't let me in.

01:18:56.396 --> 01:18:58.230
What if we cut the main power?

01:18:58.232 --> 01:18:59.831
We keep the auxiliary power,

01:18:59.833 --> 01:19:02.600
but we cut the main power
and the autopilot with it.

01:19:02.602 --> 01:19:04.736
<i>What good is that
gonna do, sir?</i>

01:19:04.738 --> 01:19:06.706
We still won't
have control of the plane.

01:19:06.708 --> 01:19:08.240
Yeah, we'd have to hope
that we don't stay locked out

01:19:08.242 --> 01:19:09.809
when the system reboots.

01:19:09.811 --> 01:19:11.643
But if we cut the main power,

01:19:11.645 --> 01:19:14.379
that will kill the engine
and the autopilot with it.

01:19:14.381 --> 01:19:16.715
which will cause a change
in the flight path.

01:19:16.717 --> 01:19:18.117
<i>You're right.</i>

01:19:18.119 --> 01:19:20.318
The autopilot doesn't descend
in a linear trajectory.

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:22.721
It's going to descend
gradually either way.

01:19:22.723 --> 01:19:24.157
<i>If you cut the power,</i>

01:19:24.159 --> 01:19:25.157
you're gonna miss
the nuclear power plant.

01:19:25.159 --> 01:19:26.158
Good call.

01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:27.326
Yeah.

01:19:27.328 --> 01:19:28.594
That must be what
the Russians did

01:19:28.596 --> 01:19:30.328
when we synced
the navigation system.

01:19:30.330 --> 01:19:32.630
Hey, look. Whatever is
locking you out, all right,

01:19:32.632 --> 01:19:35.300
it's hooked to that same
navigation system, right?

01:19:35.302 --> 01:19:36.602
Dead stick it!

01:19:36.604 --> 01:19:38.270
Ray, buddy,
you got three minutes.

01:19:38.272 --> 01:19:39.538
If you don't get
in three minutes,

01:19:39.540 --> 01:19:41.005
we'll have to bump
your trajectory.

01:19:41.007 --> 01:19:43.075
It ain't gonna look good
for the rest of us.

01:19:43.077 --> 01:19:44.579
Do you copy that?

01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:48.846
Cut the damn power, Ray.

01:19:48.848 --> 01:19:49.784
Cut it.

01:19:52.086 --> 01:19:54.452
Copy you.
Cutting power now.

01:19:54.454 --> 01:19:56.721
See you guys on the ground.

01:19:58.158 --> 01:19:59.526
Seatbelts.

01:20:05.033 --> 01:20:09.635
All right, cutting the power
in three, two, one,

01:20:09.637 --> 01:20:10.772
cutting power!

01:20:35.163 --> 01:20:38.429
<i>General Hayes, know that
Ray Rollins and a fire fighter</i>

01:20:38.431 --> 01:20:39.798
<i>have taken the Descartes plane,</i>

01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:42.233
<i>but it's locked
on a collision course.</i>

01:20:42.235 --> 01:20:43.872
<i>They're cutting
the power to divert.</i>

01:20:45.906 --> 01:20:48.640
For what it's worth,

01:20:48.642 --> 01:20:52.010
sure was nice
meeting you today.

01:20:52.012 --> 01:20:56.182
You might be one of the bravest
men I've ever met in my life.

01:20:56.184 --> 01:20:58.317
Thanks, Ray.

01:20:58.319 --> 01:21:00.155
You know, that means
a lot coming from you.

01:21:01.521 --> 01:21:04.790
And, hey, if we get out of this,

01:21:04.792 --> 01:21:07.126
you're the best man
at my wedding.

01:21:07.128 --> 01:21:09.898
I don't know how I'll explain
that to my brother.

01:21:11.833 --> 01:21:12.934
Deal.

01:21:18.806 --> 01:21:21.273
- We got light.
- Are we back now?

01:21:21.275 --> 01:21:22.544
I think so.

01:21:26.646 --> 01:21:28.382
Nothing!

01:21:30.117 --> 01:21:31.282
- Pull up!
- I'm trying!

01:21:31.284 --> 01:21:32.885
Come on.

01:21:32.887 --> 01:21:35.720
We're not all the way back yet!
We're just gliding!

01:21:35.722 --> 01:21:36.757
Come on!

01:21:40.794 --> 01:21:43.027
Oh, my God.

01:21:43.029 --> 01:21:44.462
Hold onto your seat!

01:21:44.464 --> 01:21:45.632
- Hold on!
- Brace for impact!

01:21:51.939 --> 01:21:53.208
Hold on!

01:22:02.917 --> 01:22:04.252
We made it!

01:22:06.954 --> 01:22:08.386
Woo!

01:22:08.388 --> 01:22:11.857
The rogue Descartes airliner
is on the ground!

01:22:11.859 --> 01:22:15.094
Well done, everyone.
Great job!

01:22:15.096 --> 01:22:17.094
We're clear!

01:22:17.096 --> 01:22:18.363
Call Liz.

01:22:18.365 --> 01:22:19.865
Okay.

01:22:19.867 --> 01:22:22.367
Needs to know to start
looking for wedding dresses.

01:22:22.369 --> 01:22:24.103
Copy you.

01:22:24.105 --> 01:22:25.740
There you go.
Give it a shot.

01:22:27.441 --> 01:22:31.042
Descartes Airlines airliner
to Flight 117!

01:22:31.044 --> 01:22:34.580
Descartes Airlines airliner
to Flight 117!

01:22:34.582 --> 01:22:37.349
Logan!
Logan, Logan, is that you?

01:22:37.351 --> 01:22:38.850
<i>We made it!</i>

01:22:38.852 --> 01:22:41.353
You crazy son of a bitch.
you're still alive?

01:22:41.355 --> 01:22:42.821
We gotta get the hell
off this plane.

01:22:43.757 --> 01:22:45.491
We'll catch you on the ground.

01:22:45.493 --> 01:22:46.925
I'll see you on the ground!
I'll see you on the ground!

01:22:46.927 --> 01:22:47.862
Holy cow.

01:22:54.135 --> 01:22:55.867
Let's get off this bird.

01:22:55.869 --> 01:22:56.870
Let's go!

01:23:05.779 --> 01:23:07.979
- It's a miracle.
- Woo!

01:23:07.981 --> 01:23:11.183
Yeah!
Son of a bitch, he's alive!

01:23:12.453 --> 01:23:15.353
- It's a miracle!
- Yes.

01:23:15.355 --> 01:23:16.690
That crazy son of a bitch.

01:23:18.225 --> 01:23:21.727
Ladies and gentlemen, this
is your captain speaking.

01:23:21.729 --> 01:23:23.728
<i>May I be the first
to inform you</i>

01:23:23.730 --> 01:23:26.965
<i>that the rogue
Descartes Airlines airliner</i>

01:23:26.967 --> 01:23:28.800
<i>has landed safely.</i>

01:23:35.709 --> 01:23:37.975
- Yes. They did it!
- They did it!

01:23:37.977 --> 01:23:39.411
We did it.

01:23:39.413 --> 01:23:41.080
We did it.

01:23:41.082 --> 01:23:43.348
Congratulations.

01:23:43.350 --> 01:23:44.485
We did it!

01:23:46.387 --> 01:23:48.589
- Yes!
- It's okay!

01:23:51.123 --> 01:23:52.726
I'm just so happy!

01:23:53.794 --> 01:23:55.794
They did it!

01:23:55.796 --> 01:23:56.731
Oh my God.

01:23:59.199 --> 01:24:01.769
I can't wait 'til
we get on the ground.

01:24:09.176 --> 01:24:10.242
What is that?

01:24:10.244 --> 01:24:13.813
What? What?

01:24:13.815 --> 01:24:15.947
Look.

01:24:15.949 --> 01:24:18.216
Incoming transmission
from unidentified aircraft!

01:24:18.218 --> 01:24:19.651
What is that?

01:24:19.653 --> 01:24:22.353
Just answer it.
Just answer.

01:24:22.355 --> 01:24:26.124
Circle Star 117, Sierra Delta
to unidentified aircraft.

01:24:26.126 --> 01:24:27.729
Please identify yourself.

01:24:30.029 --> 01:24:32.197
<i>You know who I am.</i>

01:24:32.199 --> 01:24:34.001
I'm the shadow in a darkness.

01:24:37.870 --> 01:24:40.438
General, it's Zolotov's jet.

01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:41.608
Acknowledged.

01:24:44.979 --> 01:24:48.147
We've come too far
to lose it all to this madman.

01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:52.218
No. No, I don't think so.

01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:53.786
We're heading his way.

01:24:53.788 --> 01:24:56.086
We're gonna need
one more stroke of luck.

01:24:56.088 --> 01:24:57.624
We got it.

01:25:48.309 --> 01:25:49.608
Hang tight!

01:25:51.445 --> 01:25:53.444
Hang on!
This bird's going down!

01:26:17.436 --> 01:26:21.740
Ohh! Ahh.

01:26:21.742 --> 01:26:23.811
Congratulations, Captain.

01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:29.313
So happy!

01:26:29.315 --> 01:26:31.282
Oh, thank God.

01:26:31.284 --> 01:26:33.153
Whoo!

01:26:35.821 --> 01:26:37.792
- We made it!
- Oh, my God!

01:26:38.726 --> 01:26:40.125
We made it.

01:26:40.127 --> 01:26:42.960
Oh, your dad would be
so proud of you now.

01:26:42.962 --> 01:26:43.996
You think?

01:26:43.998 --> 01:26:45.330
And so am I.

01:26:45.332 --> 01:26:46.901
Thanks.

01:26:48.601 --> 01:26:49.836
We made it.

01:26:50.803 --> 01:26:52.638
Let's get off this plane!

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:54.141
- Let's go!
- Come on.

01:26:59.645 --> 01:27:01.815
Come on, Noah, let's go.

01:27:30.304 --> 01:27:35.304
