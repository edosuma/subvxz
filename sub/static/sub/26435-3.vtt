and help me with one small part
of the deal...

35:14.120 --> 35:16.953
we can have a life
like you can't imagine.

35:26.320 --> 35:29.278
Whatever this is, I can't do it.

35:29.360 --> 35:32.671
I have to tell Rick.

35:32.760 --> 35:35.229
You can't choose me?

35:35.360 --> 35:37.271
Instead?

35:43.160 --> 35:45.674
Not like this.

35:48.560 --> 35:51.871
And all this time...

35:52.000 --> 35:54.719
I thought you were a B.

35:54.800 --> 35:56.757
Unh!

36:03.320 --> 36:06.073
[Branch snaps]

36:06.160 --> 36:09.516
[Walker growling]

36:34.360 --> 36:38.593
[Growling continues]

36:42.160 --> 36:44.720
[Grunts]

36:51.320 --> 36:53.311
Drop it! Don't.

36:53.400 --> 36:56.313
Solid advice.

36:56.440 --> 36:58.351
You should take it.

36:58.440 --> 37:01.796
No way you get me
before I open her up.

37:02.920 --> 37:06.390
Ain't that right, boss lady?

37:06.480 --> 37:07.754
You killed the others?

37:07.840 --> 37:10.514
Huh? Is that What you think?

37:10.600 --> 37:12.989
Shit, man, you got no damn clue.

37:13.080 --> 37:14.559
We're not killing anybody.

37:14.640 --> 37:16.995
Unless we have to.

37:17.080 --> 37:18.354
This?

37:18.440 --> 37:20.272
This is about the guns.

37:20.360 --> 37:24.035
And seeing as how
we're being hunted and all,

37:24.120 --> 37:26.157
maybe it won't come
as a big bombshell

37:26.240 --> 37:29.153
that we're vamoosing
out of your little pet project.

37:29.240 --> 37:31.993
We don't need a babysitter.

37:32.080 --> 37:36.153
We just need a little protection
for our trip home.

37:36.240 --> 37:38.516
It doesn't have to be this way.

37:38.600 --> 37:39.795
Talk time is up.

37:39.880 --> 37:41.200
Toss D.J. your gun.

37:41.320 --> 37:43.152
We'll let you walk,

37:43.280 --> 37:45.669
and we'll be on our merry way.

37:48.280 --> 37:50.794
You know, over and over,

37:50.880 --> 37:53.394
I heard you yapping about
how every life counts,

37:53.480 --> 37:55.039
and, man, I got to tell you,

37:55.120 --> 37:57.236
I'm right there with you.

37:57.320 --> 38:00.392
But if you don't give up that gun...

38:00.480 --> 38:03.040
her life ain't gonna count for shit

38:03.120 --> 38:04.758
for too much longer.

38:04.840 --> 38:07.480
You do this...

38:07.560 --> 38:09.915
there's no going back.

38:12.480 --> 38:16.235
Everything we're doing, it ends.

38:16.320 --> 38:17.833
Ended with Justin.

38:17.920 --> 38:20.116
There's no going back from that.

38:20.200 --> 38:23.113
Not for us.

38:26.720 --> 38:29.075
It's over.

38:35.320 --> 38:37.834
It's over.

38:40.880 --> 38:44.032
[Grunts] Aah!

38:44.120 --> 38:47.078
Down. Now.

38:51.760 --> 38:54.070
Keep pressure on it.

38:54.160 --> 38:56.436
-[Groans]
- We'll get to camp, fix you up.

38:56.560 --> 38:58.551
[Breathing heavily]

38:58.640 --> 39:01.996
Why not just take me out?

39:02.080 --> 39:05.516
'Cause every life counts.

39:11.080 --> 39:13.549
[Footsteps approaching]

39:22.960 --> 39:25.918
So, how do you know about this place?

39:26.000 --> 39:28.913
I think it's where they lived before.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.559
It's what I'd do.

39:34.360 --> 39:36.715
<i>H9'!-</i>

39:42.200 --> 39:45.272
Woman: Beg.

39:47.800 --> 39:51.794
Beg, like you made them beg.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.911
Drop it!

39:56.000 --> 39:58.230
Bea.

39:58.320 --> 40:01.358
It's okay.

40:05.040 --> 40:08.556
You took out Justin with that thing?

40:08.640 --> 40:10.916
He killed my husband.

40:16.120 --> 40:19.317
Arat: Daryl, please.

40:19.400 --> 40:22.756
Daryl: They got a reason?

40:22.840 --> 40:25.480
We've all done things.

40:28.040 --> 40:29.838
People will find out.

40:29.920 --> 40:31.831
She's the last one.

40:31.920 --> 40:33.957
After this, it's over.

40:34.040 --> 40:36.111
Maybe for you.

40:36.200 --> 40:38.396
But it won't be.

40:38.480 --> 40:41.438
With something like this, it keeps going.

40:43.080 --> 40:45.993
This was our home.

40:46.080 --> 40:48.549
My mother and my grandmother

40:48.640 --> 40:51.996
found this place for the group.

40:52.080 --> 40:55.038
There were so many of us then.

40:55.120 --> 40:58.795
Men and women...

40:58.880 --> 41:01.076
kids.

41:02.480 --> 41:06.189
My mom and I built a garden.

41:06.280 --> 41:10.399
Me and my brother
used to play right here.

41:10.480 --> 41:12.869
But then the Saviors came.

41:14.880 --> 41:19.113
And Simon wanted what we had.

41:20.520 --> 41:24.673
He gave us our final warning.

41:27.480 --> 41:29.198
Afterward, we ran.

41:29.280 --> 41:31.430
And we tried to forget.

41:33.320 --> 41:37.279
But, then, your people came
and asked us to fight.

41:37.360 --> 41:40.591
We did because we couldn't forget.

41:42.200 --> 41:43.793
After Rick ended it,

41:43.880 --> 41:48.113
we went along because
we didn't think we had a choice.

41:50.120 --> 41:52.794
Until you hung Gregory.

41:52.880 --> 41:56.032
That's when we knew.

41:56.120 --> 41:59.272
Rick's rules aren't the only rules.

41:59.360 --> 42:01.431
You showed us the way.

42:01.520 --> 42:04.273
It was time.

42:04.360 --> 42:07.273
You did this...

42:07.360 --> 42:10.113
because of me?

42:11.240 --> 42:13.675
[Crying] They murdered...

42:13.800 --> 42:14.915
my mother.

42:15.000 --> 42:20.678
She shot my brother right here.

42:20.760 --> 42:24.754
And they took everything
because they could.

42:27.960 --> 42:29.871
[Crying] Please.

42:29.960 --> 42:31.598
It's not like that anymore, okay?

42:31.680 --> 42:33.671
I'm-- I'm one of you now.

42:33.760 --> 42:35.478
Did you do it?

42:35.560 --> 42:39.076
Simon would've killed me, too!

42:39.200 --> 42:42.830
Cyndie: You asked me to beg for his life!

42:42.920 --> 42:47.471
He was crying, and you smiled!

42:47.560 --> 42:50.473
I told you I loved him.

42:50.560 --> 42:52.756
I needed him!

42:52.880 --> 42:56.157
He was only 11 years old.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.629
And what did you say?

42:58.760 --> 43:02.230
L-I don't remember.

43:02.320 --> 43:04.550
-[Sniffles]
- Say it!

43:04.640 --> 43:08.156
Please!

43:08.240 --> 43:10.709
What did you say?

43:12.320 --> 43:14.914
[Sniffles]

43:15.000 --> 43:17.435
"No exceptions."

43:30.240 --> 43:33.551
Oh, no. Daryl, Maggie!

43:33.640 --> 43:35.950
Daryl, you can't do this!

43:36.040 --> 43:37.872
I've changed!

43:37.960 --> 43:39.792
[crying]

44:14.880 --> 44:18.191
Right after, we agreed we'd wait.

44:18.280 --> 44:21.272
Yeah, we did.

44:21.360 --> 44:24.079
Cyndie said I showed them the way.

44:26.880 --> 44:29.440
She did the same thing for me.

44:36.520 --> 44:38.750
We gave Rick's way a chance.

44:40.960 --> 44:43.634
It's time to see Negan.

44:45.680 --> 44:47.830
All right.
