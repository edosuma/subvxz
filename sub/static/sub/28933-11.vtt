10:57.569 --> 10:59.746
but we're tracing
dental records.

10:59.789 --> 11:03.271
Uh, the decomp has helped us
narrow down time of death.

11:03.314 --> 11:06.753
Sonny, covered in a gray,
waxy substance

11:06.796 --> 11:09.016
known as adipose...

11:09.059 --> 11:10.452
Has been in the pond
the longest.

11:10.495 --> 11:11.627
Roughly five or six months.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.020
While Connie,

11:13.063 --> 11:15.022
with the heavy skin slippage,

11:15.065 --> 11:17.764
mm, maybe two or three months.

11:17.807 --> 11:21.202
And the extremely bloated
Michael,

11:21.245 --> 11:22.856
just a few weeks.

11:22.899 --> 11:25.249
We need to get a forensic artist
to start building digital facial

11:25.293 --> 11:26.598
reconstructions.
Once we know

11:26.642 --> 11:28.513
who they are,
we can establish motive.

11:28.557 --> 11:29.906
[phone buzzes]Oh, excuse me.

11:39.916 --> 11:41.701
Are you familiar with Hamlet?

11:41.744 --> 11:43.659
You can do the speech,

11:43.703 --> 11:44.834
but you're not touching
these heads.

11:46.793 --> 11:50.492
DNA from the fresh
victim's hair...
Fredo.

11:50.535 --> 11:52.146
...resulted in a hit

11:52.189 --> 11:54.017
off the criminal
DNA database. He...

11:54.061 --> 11:55.671
Fredo.

11:55.715 --> 11:59.022
...was a 26-year-old member of
the Slaughter Boys street gang.

11:59.066 --> 12:01.590
Victor Owens. Long rap
sheet. Numerous arrests

12:01.633 --> 12:03.331
with gang leader Barry Starr,

12:03.374 --> 12:04.593
who just happened to finish

12:04.636 --> 12:05.681
a recent jail sentence.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.944
Tell me more, tell me more.

12:07.988 --> 12:09.816
LIZZIE:
Okay, Sandy.

12:09.859 --> 12:11.556
Let's get out of here.
Bye, Doug.

12:14.516 --> 12:16.561
[exhales]
Dude was...

12:16.605 --> 12:19.042
he was like a brother to me.

12:19.086 --> 12:21.610
I wouldn't be here talking
to you otherwise.

12:21.653 --> 12:24.482
After everything
we went through,

12:24.526 --> 12:27.529
he still got clapped.

12:27.572 --> 12:28.573
So Victor left the gang.

12:28.617 --> 12:30.097
Maybe one of your
pals did this,

12:30.140 --> 12:31.359
to send a message?

12:31.402 --> 12:33.274
We don't decapitate.

12:33.317 --> 12:35.624
Nice to know
you draw the line somewhere.

12:37.582 --> 12:39.759
Anything else
you can tell us?

12:39.802 --> 12:41.586
After Victor
went straight,

12:41.630 --> 12:43.719
he did rehab,
hopped apartments,

12:43.763 --> 12:46.635
got a job at some medical place.

12:46.678 --> 12:49.551
He was going around
bragging about

12:49.594 --> 12:51.379
being involved in something big.

12:51.422 --> 12:54.164
We're gonna need the name
of that medical place.

12:54.208 --> 12:56.427
Stay close, Mr. Starr,

12:56.471 --> 12:58.647
and let me know if
you hear anything.

13:00.823 --> 13:03.347
Barry's been connected to
some pretty horrendous crimes.

13:03.391 --> 13:05.262
I'm not inclined
to buy a word he said.

13:05.306 --> 13:06.873
Don't stereotype,
Detective.

13:06.916 --> 13:09.353
Just because he's a gang leader
doesn't mean he's a fabulist.

13:09.397 --> 13:10.920
I'm so sorry
to offend you

13:10.964 --> 13:13.357
and the National Association
of Gang Leaders.

13:13.401 --> 13:15.011
His pupils were dilated.

13:15.055 --> 13:17.361
What do you make of that,
behaviorally speaking?

13:17.405 --> 13:20.625
Well, uh, behaviorally speaking,
I... [stammers]

13:20.669 --> 13:22.018
[sighs]

13:22.062 --> 13:23.541
I had trouble seeing him.

13:23.585 --> 13:24.542
Reading him?

13:24.586 --> 13:25.979
[sighs]
Seeing him.

13:26.022 --> 13:26.980
Uh, my vision's off.

13:27.023 --> 13:29.678
Blurry, at times.

13:29.721 --> 13:33.073
I may have been exposed
to a nerve agent.

13:34.117 --> 13:36.903
You m-may have? What?

13:36.946 --> 13:38.513
It has nothing to
do with our work.

13:38.556 --> 13:40.080
Is Julian involved?

13:40.123 --> 13:41.995
Julian is fine.
Which means

13:42.038 --> 13:43.866
I will probably be fine.

13:43.910 --> 13:45.912
Does Andy know?
About your vision?

13:45.955 --> 13:47.435
Not yet. I-I want
to make sure first.

13:47.478 --> 13:48.871
You know how he feels
about my CIA past.

13:48.915 --> 13:51.482
Dylan, you have
to see a doctor.

13:51.526 --> 13:54.659
I have, I have. And
she has scheduled an MRI.

13:55.704 --> 13:56.705
Okay.

13:56.748 --> 13:59.447
If this continues, if I...

13:59.490 --> 14:03.712
can't study people's
behavior, I...

14:03.755 --> 14:06.410
I don't know how I can
keep doing my job.

14:07.847 --> 14:11.241
I don't know how I
can keep being me.

14:21.469 --> 14:23.906
Excuse me. Uh, we're
looking for Victor Owens.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.865
We're not sure what
department he works in.

14:25.908 --> 14:28.650
Uh, Victor with a "V"?

14:28.693 --> 14:30.652
Yes.

14:30.695 --> 14:32.349
Okay, uh,

14:32.393 --> 14:34.569
Victor Owens.

14:34.612 --> 14:36.136
Nobody by that name
in the system.

14:36.179 --> 14:39.443
Hmm. "No body" is right.

14:39.487 --> 14:40.662
[chuckles wryly]

14:40.705 --> 14:43.491
So I guess the gang leader
was lying to us.

14:43.534 --> 14:44.753
You're looking for Victor?

14:44.796 --> 14:46.624
Victor doesn't work here.

14:46.668 --> 14:48.626
That's why
we don't stereotype.

14:48.670 --> 14:50.541
He's a custodian
at the Conklin Institute.

14:50.585 --> 14:54.415
The research center for
advanced cognitive neuroscience?

14:54.458 --> 14:57.157
Yes, it's upstairs.
I'm Dr. Wells.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.942
Victor isn't
in any trouble, I hope.

14:59.986 --> 15:02.162
No. Uh, who's in
charge up there?

15:02.205 --> 15:04.686
Dr. Martin Portman.

15:04.729 --> 15:06.862
Dr. Martin Portman
is a pioneer in brain studies.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.777
He's at the forefront
of novel treatments

15:08.820 --> 15:10.257
for neurological diseases.

15:10.300 --> 15:12.085
Do I smell peppermint?

15:12.128 --> 15:14.609
You don't deserve
Martin Portman.

15:14.652 --> 15:15.784
It's definitely peppermint.

15:15.827 --> 15:16.785
[sniffing]

15:16.828 --> 15:18.439
Yes, yes. Well,
certain scents,

15:18.482 --> 15:20.702
uh, invigorate the mind,
promote concentration,

15:20.745 --> 15:21.877
and stimulate
clear thinking.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.661
They probably pump it
through the vents.

15:23.705 --> 15:25.315
I knew it.

15:30.668 --> 15:31.887
Sorry to interrupt.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.759
Detective Needham and Dr...

15:34.803 --> 15:36.979
Reinhart. Dr. Wells
said to expect you.

15:37.023 --> 15:39.808
Dr. Portman, it is a pleasure.

15:39.851 --> 15:40.983
My wife, Allyson,

15:41.027 --> 15:42.202
a research associate.

15:42.245 --> 15:43.812
So nice to meet you.You, too.

15:43.855 --> 15:45.901
Oh, sorry about the sweat.
[chuckles]

15:45.945 --> 15:48.034
We've included me
in the control group

15:48.077 --> 15:50.645
for a mobility/productivity
study.

15:50.688 --> 15:53.213
And now we can't enter
this session's data due

15:53.256 --> 15:54.431
to the interruption.

15:54.475 --> 15:56.042
We hate to stand in
the way of science,

15:56.085 --> 15:59.045
but we're investigating the
murder of a man who worked here.

15:59.088 --> 16:00.437
Victor Owens.

16:00.481 --> 16:01.786
ALLYSON:
Victor's dead?

16:01.830 --> 16:04.006
Oh, he was so young.

16:04.050 --> 16:05.181
Which one's Victor?

16:05.225 --> 16:07.096
With the, um...

16:07.140 --> 16:09.751
What do you call
those ink markings? Tattoos.

16:09.794 --> 16:12.841
Was he murdered
at the institute?

16:12.884 --> 16:14.669
The institute's
name is safe.

16:14.712 --> 16:16.192
How long had Victor
been working here?

16:16.236 --> 16:18.542
About eight months.

16:18.586 --> 16:21.719
Uh, Dr. Wells, who works with
a hospital outreach board

16:21.763 --> 16:24.679
set up to employ vets
and parolees, hired him.

16:24.722 --> 16:26.855
So you knew
about Victor's criminal record?

16:26.898 --> 16:28.596
Oh, he told us
about the gang stuff,

16:28.639 --> 16:30.728
that he was looking
for a way out.

16:30.772 --> 16:32.208
Do you have an issue
with Victor,

16:32.252 --> 16:33.731
Doctor?

16:35.516 --> 16:37.648
He seemed responsible.

16:37.692 --> 16:39.650
But the past few months,

16:39.694 --> 16:41.391
he started showing up late.

16:41.435 --> 16:44.090
And, well, some drugs--

16:44.133 --> 16:45.613
uh, fentanyl,
codeine--

16:45.656 --> 16:46.701
had recently
gone missing

16:46.744 --> 16:48.746
from the supply cabinet.

16:48.790 --> 16:49.617
Did you confront him?

16:49.660 --> 16:51.532
I didn't have any proof.

16:51.575 --> 16:53.882
Any indication
of using? Dealing?

16:53.925 --> 16:56.885
Based on his recent behavior,
I wouldn't be surprised.

16:56.928 --> 16:58.713
MARTIN:
We'd like to help,

16:58.756 --> 17:00.758
but we have actual work to do.

17:00.802 --> 17:04.371
Perhaps the personnel office
might be of some assistance.

17:14.729 --> 17:16.078
Facial reconstructions

17:16.122 --> 17:17.862
of the three other heads
found in the pond.

17:17.906 --> 17:19.864
Mm, already?Preliminary.

17:19.908 --> 17:22.041
The forensic artist built
the decomposed portions

17:22.084 --> 17:23.259
of each face digitally,

17:23.303 --> 17:25.566
based on measurements
of bone structure.

17:25.609 --> 17:26.610
One Caucasian woman,

17:26.654 --> 17:28.047
two men. One
black, one...

17:28.090 --> 17:29.613
hard to tell.
All different ages.

17:29.657 --> 17:31.354
And no apparent type
or connection.

17:31.398 --> 17:33.182
You think
they could do one of me?

17:33.226 --> 17:35.576
I'd like to see what I'd look
like with a more prominent brow.

17:35.619 --> 17:36.968
Dylan.
Ha!

17:37.012 --> 17:38.448
Zack,

17:38.492 --> 17:40.450
can you make sure
these are shared citywide

17:40.494 --> 17:41.930
and run through
recognition databases?

17:41.973 --> 17:42.844
I'll start with
missing persons.

17:42.887 --> 17:43.845
Great. Thank you.

17:43.888 --> 17:44.976
HARRIS:
Here's something.

17:45.020 --> 17:46.543
The lab report indicates
trace amounts

17:46.587 --> 17:48.980
of a new, near-infrared,
voltage-sensitive dye

17:49.024 --> 17:50.417
inside all four heads.

17:51.461 --> 17:52.810
The dye is typically
used to observe

17:52.854 --> 17:54.421
electrical activity of neurons
inside the brain.

17:54.464 --> 17:57.511
For treating
neurological diseases?Yeah, that's right.

17:57.554 --> 17:58.773
Thank you.

17:58.816 --> 18:00.253
This can't be a coincidence.

18:00.296 --> 18:03.386
I wonder if they use this dye
at Conklin Institute.

18:04.387 --> 18:05.345
What are you doing?

18:05.388 --> 18:07.173
I'm rescheduling my MRI.

18:07.216 --> 18:08.609
You're not getting
out of it.

18:08.652 --> 18:10.132
I'm not getting out of it--
I'm postponing it.

18:10.176 --> 18:11.612
Let me get this straight.

18:11.655 --> 18:13.962
You're preaching to me
about taking time off work,

18:14.005 --> 18:16.051
and you can't even make
an MRI a priority?

18:16.095 --> 18:17.879
It's not the same thing.

18:17.922 --> 18:19.881
I know! Your hang-ups
are so superior.

18:19.924 --> 18:21.361
Mine pale in comparison.

18:21.404 --> 18:22.536
You can't see what I mean

18:22.579 --> 18:23.798
because you're being
too defensive.

18:23.841 --> 18:25.539
And you can't see, period.

18:25.582 --> 18:27.454
When is it?3:15.

18:27.497 --> 18:28.933
Great. After our
visit to Conklin,

18:28.977 --> 18:30.239
I'll take you
there myself,

18:30.283 --> 18:32.763
'cause you definitely
shouldn't be driving.

18:32.807 --> 18:34.983
You mentioned
some drugs went missing.

18:35.026 --> 18:36.811
Are your dyes
kept under lock and key?

18:36.854 --> 18:40.728
No. No, the contrast agent
that we use is...

18:41.772 --> 18:43.426
It's a common dye...

18:44.471 --> 18:46.777
Manganese-based.

18:46.821 --> 18:50.433
You'll find it at any
neurological research institute.

18:50.477 --> 18:52.435
What kind of research

18:52.479 --> 18:55.308
is the Conklin Institute
currently doing?

18:55.351 --> 18:58.006
Oh, I could send you
e-mail summaries

18:58.049 --> 19:01.314
of all of the trials
that we have going on.

19:01.357 --> 19:04.317
But most current studies
are centered around Alzheimer's.

19:04.360 --> 19:06.623
It's become
our primary focus since...

19:08.538 --> 19:11.759
...uh, well,
maybe a month or so?

19:11.802 --> 19:13.326
Allyson, pardon my asking,

19:13.369 --> 19:15.850
but have you been diagnosed
with early-onset Alzheimer's?

19:16.894 --> 19:18.679
Is that why Martin

19:18.722 --> 19:21.682
has made this area of research
his primary focus?

19:22.900 --> 19:25.033
What gave it away?

19:25.076 --> 19:26.774
Well, the Post-its

19:26.817 --> 19:29.080
on your desk reminding you
to do simple tasks.

19:29.124 --> 19:31.692
Exercise may help cognition

19:31.735 --> 19:33.868
and delay progression
of the disease.

19:33.911 --> 19:36.958
And... difficulty finding words.

19:37.001 --> 19:40.309
Oh, you're very observant.

19:40.353 --> 19:43.007
I still am, on good days.

19:43.051 --> 19:45.575
Although making an omelet

19:45.619 --> 19:47.882
or trying to remember
when to get off the subway

19:47.925 --> 19:50.058
isn't always so simple.

19:50.101 --> 19:52.539
I'm sorry.

19:52.582 --> 19:56.586
I can't imagine how scary
that diagnosis must be.

19:59.067 --> 20:01.896
It is scary.

20:03.158 --> 20:05.769
But it's...

20:05.813 --> 20:09.164
it's also made me realize
how precious life is. I...

20:09.208 --> 20:11.906
I want to live
every day

20:11.949 --> 20:15.736
to its fullest while I
still have my mental faculties.

20:15.779 --> 20:20.567
I'm trying to make as many new
memories as I can while I can.

20:20.610 --> 20:21.872
WELLS:
Knock, knock.

20:21.916 --> 20:23.265
LIZZIE:

Dr. Portman's focus was
a comprehensive study

21:20.191 --> 21:22.324
of brain functions
and disease.

21:22.368 --> 21:24.152
But around six months ago,
Alzheimer's research

21:24.195 --> 21:26.720
became his rabbit hole.So that lines up

21:26.763 --> 21:30.071
with when the first head
was dropped in the pond.

21:30.114 --> 21:33.030
So he was funneling all
the money given to the institute

21:33.074 --> 21:34.858
into his sudden focus
on Alzheimer's?

21:34.902 --> 21:36.643
Why is that suspicious?

21:36.686 --> 21:39.123

32:24.290 --> 32:25.900
When I spoke to Allyson,

32:25.944 --> 32:28.033
she talked about
how precious life is,

32:28.076 --> 32:31.079
and how she wanted to make more
memories while she still could.

32:31.123 --> 32:33.647
That does not sound to me
like a killer.

32:33.690 --> 32:36.171
I can't make sense of why,

32:36.215 --> 32:38.086
if Martin was doing
this research

32:38.130 --> 32:40.175
to save his wife's life,

32:40.219 --> 32:43.309
he would put her at risk
by involving her.

32:43.352 --> 32:44.614
If only we could ID
the other heads,

32:44.658 --> 32:47.313
we could build a profile
of the real killer.

32:47.356 --> 32:49.097
Or a match off
the facial reconstructions

32:49.141 --> 32:51.099
with the missing persons
databases.

32:51.143 --> 32:53.580
If only we knew someone

32:53.623 --> 32:56.061
who had more
advanced technology.

33:00.021 --> 33:02.719
JULIAN:
Tammy Hayes. 48.

33:02.763 --> 33:05.157
Any connection
with the Portmans?

33:05.200 --> 33:07.855
JULIAN:
She didn't have Alzheimer's,

33:07.898 --> 33:10.205
and was never a patient
at the Conklin Institute.

33:10.249 --> 33:13.774
However...

33:13.817 --> 33:16.385
she did have stage four
lung cancer and was a patient

33:16.429 --> 33:19.040
in the critical care unit
of the same hospital.

33:19.084 --> 33:20.999
There was a brief lawsuit
against the hospital.

33:21.042 --> 33:23.001
It was settled.

33:23.044 --> 33:26.395
Seems Tammy signed her body off
to research.

33:26.439 --> 33:28.441
A relative signed
the settlement papers

33:28.484 --> 33:30.486
after her death.

33:32.488 --> 33:35.709
Aunt Tammy stopped treatment
about three months ago.

33:35.752 --> 33:37.015
She checked herself
out of the clinic

33:37.058 --> 33:38.755
so she could die at
home and in peace.

33:38.799 --> 33:41.062
Did she talk to you about
leaving her body to science?

33:41.106 --> 33:44.326
I only found out later when I
was trying to handle her burial.

33:44.370 --> 33:45.632
Were you two close?

33:45.675 --> 33:46.633
Not particularly.

33:46.676 --> 33:49.853
But she was very religious,

33:49.897 --> 33:50.941
which is another reason why
I was surprised

33:50.985 --> 33:52.421
to find out
she wanted to do this.

33:52.465 --> 33:55.076
Did you talk to anyone
about how she made her decision?

33:55.120 --> 33:56.643
I tried,

33:56.686 --> 33:58.819
because maybe she wasn't
in the best state of mind

33:58.862 --> 34:00.864
when she agreed to die.

34:00.908 --> 34:02.431
Maybe someone
had talked her into it.

34:02.475 --> 34:04.738
But the willed donor department
had a signed release.

34:05.826 --> 34:07.088
And anyway, at that point,

34:07.132 --> 34:08.698
there was no body left to bury.

34:08.742 --> 34:11.136
Aunt Tammy had already been
chopped up and brokered off

34:11.179 --> 34:12.833
to science.Oh.

34:12.876 --> 34:14.835
Do you remember
who you dealt with?

34:14.878 --> 34:17.925
Who was in charge?Yeah, it was this
really nice guy...

34:17.968 --> 34:19.840
Dr. Wells.

34:21.885 --> 34:24.062
If Wells was brokering
the bodies...

34:24.105 --> 34:25.802
Explains why we
couldn't find them.

34:25.846 --> 34:28.240
Maybe Victor was helping him
dispose of the heads.

34:28.283 --> 34:29.719
That gang leader did say

34:29.763 --> 34:32.070
that Victor had
some big stuff going on.

34:32.113 --> 34:34.724
And the data Julian found
on Allyson's laptop--

34:34.768 --> 34:36.813
Wells could have planted
it there to frame her.

34:36.857 --> 34:38.815
Leading us to think
it was her Alzheimer's

34:38.859 --> 34:40.208
that made her forget
to delete it.

34:40.252 --> 34:42.732
[sighs] Dr. Wells may have

34:42.776 --> 34:45.779
a more extreme God complex
than Portman.

34:45.822 --> 34:47.998
Rules are for mere mortals.

34:48.042 --> 34:50.131
A severe lack
of empathy for others.

34:50.175 --> 34:51.741
He wouldn't even
see them as human,

34:51.785 --> 34:54.135
just subjects
for his radical research.[phone buzzes]

34:54.179 --> 34:55.832
[groans]

34:55.876 --> 34:57.573
They ID'd the
other two victims.

34:57.617 --> 34:59.662
One had coronary
artery disease;

34:59.706 --> 35:01.708
the other, fulminant
hepatic failure.

35:01.751 --> 35:03.579
Both terminal.And both...

35:03.623 --> 35:05.973
at the same hospital.[Dylan sighs]

35:18.028 --> 35:20.030
Dr. Wells?

35:44.142 --> 35:46.100
Is that a showerhead?

35:46.144 --> 35:48.189
DYLAN:
Not unusual

35:48.233 --> 35:52.628
in a lab, but sure helpful if
you're dismembering bodies.

36:13.127 --> 36:14.824
Wow!

36:14.868 --> 36:16.870
Is that a guillotine?

36:16.913 --> 36:19.960
A quick, painless
and easy method

36:20.003 --> 36:22.223
to kill
your terminally ill patients

36:22.267 --> 36:25.444
and record their brain activity.

36:30.100 --> 36:31.624
Can I help you?
DYLAN:
Dr. Wells.

36:31.667 --> 36:33.103
As a matter of fact, yes.

36:37.934 --> 36:39.414
We'd like to talk with you about
murdering Victor Owens, Tammy...

36:39.458 --> 36:41.155
Murdering?

36:41.199 --> 36:42.417
I didn't murder anyone.

36:42.461 --> 36:44.680
Those people were already dying.

36:44.724 --> 36:47.727
Each one of them
signed up for it, okay?

36:47.770 --> 36:49.381
They knew my research
had the potential

36:49.424 --> 36:51.252
to change the world
for the better.

36:51.296 --> 36:55.169
Oh, so a win-win.

36:55.213 --> 36:57.563
Except for the dead people.

36:57.606 --> 37:01.088
Oh. This isn't about winning.

37:01.131 --> 37:03.395
My research
can help fight diseases

37:03.438 --> 37:06.572
that shatter people's lives
and their families.

37:06.615 --> 37:09.270
I can save millions of people.

37:09.314 --> 37:10.619
Sometimes you got to break
a few eggs?

37:10.663 --> 37:12.621
Eggs were already broken.

37:12.665 --> 37:15.145
These people were already dying.

37:15.189 --> 37:16.582
Victor wasn't.

37:16.625 --> 37:18.366
Victor was killing himself
with a fentanyl addiction.

37:18.410 --> 37:20.020
It was only a matter of time.

37:20.063 --> 37:21.587
A man with a checkered past
working with you

37:21.630 --> 37:22.849
made the perfect cover.

37:22.892 --> 37:25.112
But his drug use
was making him a liability.

37:25.155 --> 37:27.854
You couldn't risk him talking,
so you killed him.

37:27.897 --> 37:31.727
Detective,
how many people can truly say

37:31.771 --> 37:33.947
that their lives had meaning?

37:33.990 --> 37:36.515
Each one of my subjects

37:36.558 --> 37:39.518
died knowing, at the end,

37:39.561 --> 37:41.259
their lives mattered.

37:41.302 --> 37:43.261
DYLAN: Yes, I'm sure
that's what you told them.

37:43.304 --> 37:44.653
But did you also spell out

37:44.697 --> 37:46.742
that the experimental procedure
they signed up for

37:46.786 --> 37:48.527
was to be beheaded alive?

37:48.570 --> 37:49.876
[chuckles]:
Wow.

37:49.919 --> 37:51.791
You're so... principled

37:51.834 --> 37:54.750
and humane and sanctimonious.

37:54.794 --> 37:56.709
But, uh, let me
ask you a question.

37:56.752 --> 37:58.363
How will you sleep at night

37:58.406 --> 38:02.280
knowing these few precious eggs
you keep unbroken

38:02.323 --> 38:03.846
will crush millions of others?

38:03.890 --> 38:06.545
Their uncured diseases,

38:06.588 --> 38:08.111
their pain,

38:08.155 --> 38:11.201
their deaths will be
on your head, not mine.No.

38:11.245 --> 38:13.769
Quadruple homicide
will be on your head.

38:13.813 --> 38:15.641
Oh, people die every day.

38:15.684 --> 38:16.816
Murderers kill every day.

38:16.859 --> 38:18.557
You'rethe murderers!

38:18.600 --> 38:20.820
You're the ones
who should be locked up, not me!

38:20.863 --> 38:24.737
You do not get to decide
whose lives do and don't matter.

38:24.780 --> 38:26.782
You're under arrest for murder.

38:54.419 --> 38:57.509
Well, well, well.

38:57.552 --> 38:59.511
It's good to see you, Julian.

39:01.817 --> 39:06.082
I'd put out my hand,
but would you shake it?

39:10.130 --> 39:12.001
Shall we get to work?

39:12.045 --> 39:14.917
Let's do that.

39:14.961 --> 39:18.747
And, uh, let me say
how sorry I am about Maya.

39:20.793 --> 39:22.708
If you had anything to do
with her death,

39:22.751 --> 39:24.100
I will kill you.

39:24.144 --> 39:26.146
[chuckles]

39:27.539 --> 39:30.280
Nice to see you haven't changed.

39:30.324 --> 39:32.326
Shall we?

39:38.680 --> 39:41.379
And you call me the minute
you get your results, right?

39:41.422 --> 39:43.729
Um, the MRI got interrupted,

39:43.772 --> 39:46.993
so I'm going back in tomorrow
to do it again.

39:47.036 --> 39:48.647
But I have
a good feeling about it.

39:48.690 --> 39:51.867
Suddenly I'm... seeing clearly.

39:51.911 --> 39:53.956
Any idea what happened?Mm-hmm.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.437
The release of adrenaline
and norepinephrine

39:56.481 --> 39:58.439
from the medulla
of my adrenal glands.

39:58.483 --> 39:59.788
[chuckles]

39:59.832 --> 40:01.311
Acute stress disorder,

40:01.355 --> 40:03.052
also known
as fight-or-flight response.

40:03.096 --> 40:05.925
What was the threat?Not what.

40:05.968 --> 40:07.361
Who.

40:07.405 --> 40:08.754
It's a long story.

40:08.797 --> 40:10.277
I'll tell you about it
when you get back.

40:10.320 --> 40:11.887
Okay.

40:11.931 --> 40:14.237
What did you choose?
Fight or flight?

40:15.456 --> 40:17.415
[laughs]

40:17.458 --> 40:19.765
When I was in the CIA,

40:19.808 --> 40:21.331
we were wired
not to think about death.

40:21.375 --> 40:23.290
We just did our job.

40:23.333 --> 40:27.381
Then I met Andy,
and he thought about it for me.

40:27.425 --> 40:30.515
Now, with our baby on the way,

40:30.558 --> 40:34.388
being here,
staying around matters.

40:35.520 --> 40:37.522
Really, for the first time.

40:38.784 --> 40:41.830
I'm very glad to hear that.

40:41.874 --> 40:44.398
And I'm very glad
you're doing this.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.313
What made you change your mind?

40:48.358 --> 40:51.361
If Allyson can find a way
to make more memories,

40:51.405 --> 40:54.364
I should be able to, as well.

40:54.408 --> 40:56.758
I mean, if your life
flashed before your eyes,

40:56.802 --> 40:57.890
it would take an hour.

40:57.933 --> 40:59.805
Mine would last
the length of a yawn.

40:59.848 --> 41:01.502
I'm proud of you.

41:01.546 --> 41:02.895
I'm gonna miss you.

41:02.938 --> 41:04.853
Oh, please.
I'm gonna be gone two weeks.

41:04.897 --> 41:06.768
You'll forget I'm gone
before lunch.

41:06.812 --> 41:08.901
Nothing of the sort.

41:08.944 --> 41:11.077
I'll be here when you get back.

41:11.120 --> 41:12.774
I know.

41:15.777 --> 41:18.214
Take good care of him.

41:18.258 --> 41:20.216
I will. You know what they say,

41:20.260 --> 41:23.219
nothing prepares you for
parenthood like having a dog.

41:23.263 --> 41:27.441
And Andy and I are gonna
spoil you rotten, Gary.

41:27.485 --> 41:29.443
Take good care of her.

41:29.487 --> 41:32.402
Oh, I will.

41:33.403 --> 41:35.405
Thank you.

41:37.407 --> 41:39.801
Where are you going?

41:39.845 --> 41:42.151
Nowhere in particular.

41:42.195 --> 41:44.937
I've always wanted
to travel across country,

41:44.980 --> 41:47.896
and I realized,
what have I been waiting for?

41:47.940 --> 41:50.812
How very unexpected of you,
Detective Needham.

41:50.856 --> 41:52.901
Just going where the road

41:52.945 --> 41:56.949
and your 170-horsepower
machine takes me.

41:56.992 --> 41:58.254
Except one stop.

41:58.298 --> 42:01.301
Uh, there's an MMA match
in Vegas on Saturday.

42:01.344 --> 42:03.956
I may pop in there.

42:03.999 --> 42:06.045
Good-bye, handsome.

42:06.088 --> 42:08.264
Bye, Lizzie.

42:08.308 --> 42:09.962
Oh, you-you were talking
to Gary.

42:10.005 --> 42:12.704
Well, that's embarrassing.[engine starts]

42:20.494 --> 42:22.452
So...

42:22.496 --> 42:24.498
what do you feel like doing?

42:25.499 --> 42:27.501
Come on.

42:31.766 --> 42:33.725
Do you have any
upcoming appointments

42:33.768 --> 42:36.031
I should know about, Gary?
