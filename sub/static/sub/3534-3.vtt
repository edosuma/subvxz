WEBVTT

00:10.745 --> 00:13.211
This is
fucking epic.

00:13.245 --> 00:18.280
I never thought I'd be in Myrtle
Beach with Kenny Fucking Powers.

00:18.314 --> 00:22.016
Oh...

00:24.020 --> 00:26.755
Oh, uh, why don't...
Hey, why don't you help unpack the boxes?

00:26.789 --> 00:28.790
I'm gonna go look for Kenny, okay?

00:28.825 --> 00:31.959
Okay. Okay. Love you. Love you.

00:35.563 --> 00:37.297
Whoa!

00:43.534 --> 00:47.035
Kenny! I fuckin'
made it!

00:47.069 --> 00:48.503
You shredded!

00:48.537 --> 00:51.804
Surf's motherfuckin' up, nigga!

00:51.838 --> 00:53.371
Let's take it down a notch, Stevie.

00:53.406 --> 00:55.539
There's lots of pussy at the beach!

00:55.573 --> 00:57.275
Yeah, dawg, that's how I do.

00:57.309 --> 00:58.743
Excuse me.

00:58.777 --> 01:01.211
Yeah. I fuckin'
made it, dude.

01:01.245 --> 01:03.213
Hey, will you hit me
with my towel real quick?

01:05.516 --> 01:06.950
Oh, hello, sir.

01:06.984 --> 01:09.351
Yep. I put Toby in that hole, so
no one would try to kidnap him.

01:09.385 --> 01:10.552
That's smart.

01:10.587 --> 01:12.420
Parenting skills.

01:12.454 --> 01:15.256
I don't know if, uh, you've been working
out or what, but your body's lookin' good!

01:15.290 --> 01:17.057
Yeah, it is. It's
these waves, dawg.

01:17.091 --> 01:18.724
It tightens everything up in the core.

01:20.960 --> 01:22.893
Oh, nice, man. You see me fuckin'
dominate that wave there, Powers!

01:22.928 --> 01:24.660
Straight owning it, Shane!
Uh, you know it!

01:24.695 --> 01:26.195
<i>Top Gun,</i> dawg, I'm Tom Cruise.
That's right...

01:26.229 --> 01:28.363
I'm Tom Cruise...
Who's, who's this...person?

01:28.398 --> 01:30.964
Who am I? Well, I'm the guy
who's about to whip your ass

01:30.999 --> 01:32.932
for gettin' my truck shot with
a cannonball, motherfucker...

01:32.966 --> 01:35.767
Uh-oh, oh, oh, oh!
-  Oh...

01:35.802 --> 01:38.001
- Oh! Oh-ho! He boned you!
- We got, we got...

01:38.036 --> 01:39.470
Uh, I'm just fuckin' with you, man.

01:39.504 --> 01:40.738
This is Shane.
That's right.

01:40.772 --> 01:42.205
He's my best friend. Yeah.

01:42.239 --> 01:43.807
- Best friends? Really?
- Yeah.

01:43.841 --> 01:45.008
It's really
good meetin' ya.

01:45.043 --> 01:46.375
Oh!

01:46.410 --> 01:47.743
Burned him twice!
Twice!

01:50.413 --> 01:51.914
He's at the beach, motherfucker!

01:51.948 --> 01:54.248
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- He's in the ocean!

01:59.953 --> 02:02.154
I'm gonna need you two to
hit the ground running, okay?

02:02.188 --> 02:05.357
We're gonna have to unfortunately
convert the dojo into Toby's room.

02:05.391 --> 02:07.658
I'm gonna need you to
baby-proof this bitch up,

02:07.692 --> 02:09.727
stash all the weapons,
make it kid-friendly.

02:09.761 --> 02:13.262
You two will use my computer research
lab as your sleeping chambers.

02:13.297 --> 02:14.696
There a bed for each of you.

02:14.730 --> 02:17.165
Separate beds.
Got it.

02:17.199 --> 02:19.033
So, my bedroom is at
the end of the hall.

02:19.067 --> 02:20.668
But that is strictly
off-limits, all right?

02:20.702 --> 02:22.303
In fact, I think I need
you to go get a deadbolt.

02:22.337 --> 02:24.170
Because I'm gonna lock that shit up.
Are we clear?

02:24.205 --> 02:27.573
Yes, crystal clear.
Um, and now, uh...

02:27.608 --> 02:30.476
Um... No, never...

02:30.511 --> 02:32.444
What the fuck are
you two whispering about?

02:32.478 --> 02:37.247
Okay. In order to avoid some of the behavioral
issues that have occurred in the past...

02:37.282 --> 02:42.751
Uh, Maria thought it would be a good
idea if I lay down some ground rules.

02:42.786 --> 02:44.152
You gotta be fuckin' kidding me!

02:44.186 --> 02:46.487
No, I'm, I'm not kidding, uh...

02:46.521 --> 02:49.255
"Rules for new
relationship with Kenny Powers."

02:49.290 --> 02:51.491
Hmm!
"It is important...

02:51.525 --> 02:56.061
"For us to share a mutual respect
for one another." Hmm...

02:56.095 --> 02:59.330
"It's not healthy for me
to put you on a pedestal.

02:59.364 --> 03:01.030
"Or put you above me.

03:01.065 --> 03:04.834
"Or think about how
a world without you...

03:04.869 --> 03:08.204
"Wouldn't even be
a world worth living in."

03:08.238 --> 03:09.605
What, are you about to cry?

03:09.639 --> 03:11.140
No. No, no, no, no.

03:11.174 --> 03:13.075
Okay...

03:13.110 --> 03:14.610
"I will also no longer...

03:14.644 --> 03:18.879
"I will also no longer be able to
loan you large sums of money."

03:18.914 --> 03:21.248
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What
about in case of emergency?

03:21.283 --> 03:22.482
No. No, no, no, no.

03:22.516 --> 03:24.651
Well, in the case of an...emergency?
Stevie, no.

03:24.686 --> 03:27.453
Like, what if I was at a store and I found
a hot-ass, fuckin' shirt I was gonna wear?

03:27.488 --> 03:31.123
I think that might qualify, because you'd
probably look good as hell in that shirt.

03:31.157 --> 03:32.558
Hmm, Maria.

03:32.592 --> 03:38.430
And finally, "We must,
by law, have the...

03:38.464 --> 03:45.000
"Most coolest and amazing shit, awesome
time in Myrtle fucking Beach."

03:45.035 --> 03:48.936
"And party
like the fuck!"

03:48.971 --> 03:51.672
"Sincerely,
Stevie Janowski."

03:51.706 --> 03:54.642
Hmm. All right. Well...

03:54.676 --> 03:57.944
There are a shit ton of fun things to
do in Myrtle Beach, that's for sure.

03:57.979 --> 04:00.079
Let's not forget about Toby, okay?

04:00.113 --> 04:02.014
I mean, you guys are parents now.

04:02.048 --> 04:04.916
And with parenthood,
comes certain sacrifices.

04:04.951 --> 04:07.886
A white baby needs
care, basically, 24/7.

04:07.920 --> 04:09.320
Got it!

04:09.354 --> 04:12.323
Uh, he a very handsome baby. Daddy.

04:12.356 --> 04:14.591
Oh,
yeah, he is a handsome baby.

04:14.625 --> 04:17.259
Look who's stringing together sentences, huh?
Miss Rules over here.

04:17.293 --> 04:20.663
I got a pretty fuckin'
dope life here in Myrtle Beach.

04:20.697 --> 04:25.064
I'm not gonna let some handsome,
hot-as-fuck, little child ruin it.

04:25.099 --> 04:28.801
You got that, Toby? Look how cute he is.
I fuckin' hate him.

04:28.836 --> 04:32.137
The Feeling of Winning Big Time, Dude.

04:32.171 --> 04:34.372
<i>Once upon a time,</i>
<i>I believed in destiny.</i>

04:34.406 --> 04:38.175
<i>But now I say F that B.
Everything I have in this life, I earn myself.</i>

04:38.209 --> 04:40.211
<i>There's no cosmic luck</i>
<i>deciding shit for us.</i>

04:40.245 --> 04:43.680
<i>My wealth, my fame, my World
Series pennant, I earned myself.</i>

04:43.715 --> 04:46.049
<i>The one thing I didn't earn
myself was when I caught crabs.</i>

04:46.083 --> 04:48.118
<i>I think I got those from</i>
<i>sleeping at a Red Roof Inn.</i>

04:48.152 --> 04:49.953
I'm like, "I ain't
got no cash, though."

04:49.987 --> 04:52.555
She goes, "Well, how about you let me
give you a hand job, and it'll be on me."

04:52.589 --> 04:54.290
I was like, "Yes, ma'am." Hmm.
Oh...nice!

04:54.325 --> 04:56.424
Celebrity! Celebrity. Yeah. Celebrity.

04:56.459 --> 04:58.993
What the fuck are you Satan
worshippers lookin' at over here?

04:59.027 --> 05:00.728
Texas is here, man.

05:00.762 --> 05:03.129
Six-foot-three,
215 pounds...

05:03.164 --> 05:04.697
Texas.

05:04.731 --> 05:06.466
The son of a bitch has barely
got peach fuzz over his pecker.

05:06.500 --> 05:08.467
Nobody
else knows about him.

05:08.501 --> 05:11.103
And he ain't got nowhere else to play.
Something's in his DNA...

05:11.137 --> 05:13.471
A
little help with the ball, please?

05:14.372 --> 05:15.839
It's me.
Who's that?

05:15.873 --> 05:17.540
Just kidding.
Psyche your mind.

05:17.575 --> 05:18.909
Psyche your
mind again, it's me.

05:18.943 --> 05:21.477
Oh, it ain't "La Flame
Fucking Blanca."

05:21.511 --> 05:23.179
Yeah!

05:23.214 --> 05:24.680
Straight up from the Southside.
<i>Que pasa, Kenny Powers?</i>

05:24.714 --> 05:25.848
How you
doin', golden boy?

05:25.882 --> 05:27.249
I'm just golden, baby,
you said the word.

05:27.284 --> 05:28.750
Mmm-hmm. Meanwhile, you're down here...

05:28.784 --> 05:31.719
Squirtin' fire like
a dragon's pussy. Ha!

05:31.754 --> 05:34.254
You bet your ass I am.
Don't you think Te-xas...

05:34.289 --> 05:36.522
Ain't nibbling at your
<i>huevos,</i> either, hoss.

05:36.557 --> 05:38.058
I can feel 'em. I fuckin'
come home sometimes,

05:38.092 --> 05:40.159
and feel like maybe one of 'em
had a little bite out of it.

05:40.194 --> 05:41.460
You know
who it is.

05:41.494 --> 05:44.995
That's you, takin' a bite!

05:45.030 --> 05:46.930
That's right. How you
doin', Roy? You been good?

05:46.965 --> 05:48.699
I'm sorry, what's your name? Shane.

05:48.733 --> 05:49.999
Hey, Shane.
It's your boy, Shane.

05:50.033 --> 05:51.200
This is Shane. He's...

05:51.234 --> 05:52.835
Shane catch your balls?
How you been, man?

05:52.869 --> 05:54.636
- Yeah, Sh... Shane's the catcher
on the team. - Yeah?

05:54.670 --> 05:56.271
How you doin'? You good?
You good? All right, I'm good, Shane.

05:56.305 --> 05:58.138
Yeah? I'm good.
You give, give me a second here to talk.

05:58.172 --> 05:59.639
To my man Kenny Powers.
You still driving that Blazer?

05:59.674 --> 06:01.241
- Just a s...second...
- So, Kenny...

06:01.275 --> 06:02.841
Like I said, things are
lookin' real good for you...

06:02.875 --> 06:04.876
Uh-huh? Okay. Out here on the mound.

06:04.911 --> 06:07.845
Uh, that's not the reason that
I'm here today. All right?

06:07.879 --> 06:09.914
Have a look on the mound.

06:12.116 --> 06:14.215
Who the fuck
is this idiot?

06:14.250 --> 06:19.519
He's from Russia. First name
Ivan, last name, Dochenko.

06:19.554 --> 06:20.787
Asian dude?

06:24.757 --> 06:26.724
Wholly cracklin' shit!

06:26.759 --> 06:29.760
He's already thrown 80 balls today.
Did we clock in at what?

06:29.794 --> 06:31.227
102.

06:31.262 --> 06:32.929
1-0-2.

06:32.963 --> 06:34.864
Where the hell did you
say you found this kid?

06:34.899 --> 06:38.634
The Russians were prepping him to be their
stud on the mound, coming to the new Olympics.

06:38.669 --> 06:41.803
But baseball got voted out of
the games, and we got him.

06:41.837 --> 06:44.905
And with 102, I'd say he's
some kind of fuckin' prodigy.

06:44.939 --> 06:48.608
Big deal. This fuckin' Russian
asswipe can throw 102 at practice,

06:48.642 --> 06:50.977
but can homeboy do that shit in
the heat of a game? That's right.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.911
You don't throw 102 in practice.

06:52.946 --> 06:55.347
Because what's the point?
It's fuckin' practice.

06:55.381 --> 06:56.847
Take a walk with me, Kenny.

06:56.882 --> 06:57.982
Get your head out of your ass!

06:58.016 --> 07:00.017
Come on, Skip, it's practice.

07:01.353 --> 07:03.120
Whoo! Lookin'
good, Ivan!

07:03.154 --> 07:07.389
Step off the mound a minute, and take a break.
I want you to meet somebody.

07:07.423 --> 07:10.391
Ivan Dochenko, Kenny Powers.

07:10.425 --> 07:12.025
Hello. I've never
heard of you before.

07:12.060 --> 07:14.026
I grew
up watching you, as a boy.

07:14.060 --> 07:16.462
Don't try to date me,
brother. I ain't that old.

07:16.497 --> 07:21.166
I'm dyin' to know, how much better
is America than, uh, Russian place?

07:21.201 --> 07:23.568
By "Russian place," do you
mean Russia the nation?

07:23.602 --> 07:25.236
Yeah.

07:25.270 --> 07:29.206
America's good, you know? It's like, it's
like Russia in many ways, I feel like.

07:29.240 --> 07:30.940
You should come and visit sometime.

07:30.974 --> 07:32.608
Why would I want to
go to Russia? They're...

07:32.642 --> 07:34.943
Obviously have been enemies of
America for the longest time.

07:34.977 --> 07:36.311
Why would I go visit?
Not for many years.

07:36.345 --> 07:39.646
That's all over now. That
ended back in the '80s almost.

07:39.681 --> 07:42.482
So you think. But the people
in charge don't think that.

07:42.517 --> 07:44.885
You think there's still
conflict between...

07:44.919 --> 07:48.221
Do I think? I know.
Whatever. Tomato, tomato.

07:48.255 --> 07:49.522
Which one?

07:50.823 --> 07:52.123
What, what is he talking about?

07:52.158 --> 07:53.992
You said, "Tomato, tomato."
I don't know what does...

07:54.026 --> 07:55.225
I think we got a
little language barrier.

07:55.260 --> 07:56.360
What the fuck is going on here?

07:56.394 --> 07:58.329
This, this is what you want me to do?

07:58.363 --> 08:00.330
Just so I can sit here and play word games
with this motherfucker. Yakov Smirnoff?

08:00.364 --> 08:01.531
His prose is good.
We got a language barrier.

08:01.565 --> 08:02.799
I need a little patience
from you, all right?

08:02.833 --> 08:04.366
Hey. Hop up there and stay loose. Yes.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.035
Keep throwin' the ball.
Yeah, throw ball.

08:06.069 --> 08:08.035
Kenny, take a walk with me.
Let's go. Let's go talk a minute.

08:08.070 --> 08:11.506
Good to meet you. You're
face is...is big. I like it.

08:11.540 --> 08:13.574
So, what do you
think of the kid?

08:13.609 --> 08:15.810
I don't know, Roy. It seems
like he has a big ego.

08:15.844 --> 08:19.712
And if there's one thing I've learned, uh, there
is no room for egos and shit in baseball.

08:19.747 --> 08:22.347
That's exactly what I wanna
talk to you about, Kenny.

08:23.483 --> 08:25.917
Kenny, I want you to be his mentor.

08:25.951 --> 08:28.553
I want you to take that
kid under your wing.

08:28.587 --> 08:31.621
I want you to show him how
a Big Leaguer does things.

08:31.656 --> 08:35.191
You tryin' to turn me into
motherfuckin' Mr. Miyagi?

08:35.225 --> 08:37.792
Mr. Miyagi was a
bad motherfucker.

08:37.827 --> 08:40.128
Well, Mr. Miyagi was fucking
four feet tall and Chinese.

08:40.163 --> 08:41.895
Man, I'm not trying to
do that, I'm trying to...

08:41.929 --> 08:43.397
You've never let me down yet, Kenny.

08:43.431 --> 08:45.099
You've been a consummate professional.

08:45.133 --> 08:48.834
Well, Roy, you're asking
a whole lot of me here.

08:48.869 --> 08:50.869
I know I am.

08:50.903 --> 08:53.837
It's only because I know
you can handle it, hoss.

08:53.871 --> 08:55.972
Love ya, baby.

08:56.007 --> 08:58.540
Fucker.

08:59.976 --> 09:03.478
Whenever I've experienced
major obstacles in my life,

09:03.512 --> 09:05.446
I can usually depend on the power

09:05.481 --> 09:08.148
of a beautiful woman's
love to help me conquer.

09:08.182 --> 09:12.418
If the time comes, and I call
upon you to believe in me...

09:13.420 --> 09:15.354
Will you do it?

09:15.388 --> 09:17.222
Do what?

09:17.257 --> 09:20.925
Will you be the woman, that would come
to a very important game of mine...

09:20.960 --> 09:26.096
In the moment of crisis, rise,
stand, look me dead in the eyes,

09:26.130 --> 09:28.564
and give me the confidence
I need to prevail?

09:29.600 --> 09:33.936
I mean, I guess...
If I'm free.

09:33.970 --> 09:37.204
Okay. Yeah. All right, well,
cool. I'll take that. Sure.

09:37.238 --> 09:39.606
Cool. Well, thank you for believing
in me in all your heart, it...

09:39.641 --> 09:42.675
You're welcome.
It, it's whatever.

09:42.710 --> 09:45.911
In other news, looks like I'm
stuck with the kid for a spell.

09:45.945 --> 09:47.445
Ew, that sucks.

09:47.480 --> 09:49.480
You think I want to fuckin'
hang out with my fuckin' son?

09:49.514 --> 09:51.248
Hell no! I'd much rather
be doing cocaine,

09:51.283 --> 09:54.317
and watching the <i>Saw</i> movies on
DVD in your dorm room with ya.

09:54.351 --> 09:56.186
Well, then what are you gonna do?

09:56.220 --> 09:58.053
Kind of hard to say at this point.

09:58.088 --> 10:01.523
His bitch of a mom dumped
his ass on me, stone cold.

10:01.557 --> 10:03.258
Yeah, and guess what else?

10:03.292 --> 10:06.027
She also tried to seduce me,
put, put me into drugs, and

10:06.061 --> 10:09.397
put alcohol down my throat, and
tried to have me have sex to her.

10:09.432 --> 10:10.664
Did you?

10:10.699 --> 10:12.266
Well, you know, I'd never lie to you.

10:12.300 --> 10:14.634
So, did you have sex with her?

10:14.668 --> 10:17.136
Uh-uh. Nope.

10:17.170 --> 10:18.737
Because what we have is solid gold.

10:18.771 --> 10:21.473
Why am I gonna ruin that on some
old, worn-out pussy that...

10:21.507 --> 10:23.007
Popped a kid out
a year ago? No.

10:23.041 --> 10:24.876
I trust you.

10:24.910 --> 10:26.211
I trust you, too.

10:28.000 --> 10:34.074

11:08.275 --> 11:09.742
Whoo! Look
at him go, huh?

11:09.777 --> 11:12.279
That a boy!
Go on and get it!

11:12.313 --> 11:14.046
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

11:14.080 --> 11:15.547
What are you doin' out here?
Why aren't you swimming?

11:15.581 --> 11:17.582
I had tubes in my ears as a kid.

11:17.616 --> 11:18.883
So...
Oh, I gotcha.

11:18.917 --> 11:20.584
Surprise, surprise.

11:20.619 --> 11:22.952
Dude loves
ridin' some wave, Huck.

11:22.986 --> 11:25.620
Cutting him up like he
a fucking Ginsu knife!

11:25.654 --> 11:29.557
Kenny's good at everything that has to
do with water. Swimming, Jet Ski...

11:29.591 --> 11:31.325
No, I know, Steve, I know.

11:31.360 --> 11:33.627
- Oh, you do?
- Yeah, I do.

11:33.661 --> 11:35.295
Yeah, I know
a lot about Kenny.

11:35.330 --> 11:37.197
- Really?
- Yeah, I get him.

11:37.231 --> 11:40.766
Yeah. In fact, the only thing
I don't get about him...

11:40.800 --> 11:43.400
Is how the fuck you
factor into the situation.

11:43.435 --> 11:47.403
What? No... My
role is essential.

11:47.437 --> 11:49.905
Who do you think got
him where he is today?

11:49.940 --> 11:54.075
I knew that man when he was
a dumb, fucking teacher.

11:54.109 --> 11:56.209
Oh, no kidding?
When he lived in Mexico.

11:56.244 --> 11:57.878
I knew him in high school!

11:57.912 --> 11:59.479
Well, yeah, I know about
you in high school.

11:59.513 --> 12:02.015
I think I have an
understanding of Kenny,

12:02.049 --> 12:04.283
over a long range
of years. I...

12:04.317 --> 12:06.685
Okay, well, then where you've been
this last year, speaking of years?

12:06.720 --> 12:09.454
This dude's at a very important
time in his deal right now.

12:09.489 --> 12:11.489
And he can't be getting
distracted, okay?

12:11.523 --> 12:15.525
Last thing he needs is some fuckin'
bitch-ass, little boy toy,

12:15.560 --> 12:17.761
goddamn, hanger-on like
you getting in his way.

12:17.796 --> 12:19.262
Don't get in his way!

12:20.931 --> 12:22.798
I'm not gonna get in his way.
You... Good.

12:22.832 --> 12:24.565
You don't get in his way, then. Hey!

12:24.599 --> 12:26.667
You have nothin' to worry about.
I got my eye on the ball,

12:26.701 --> 12:29.502
just like a catcher's supposed to do.

12:29.536 --> 12:32.370
Well, I got my eye on balls as well.
Oh, no kiddin'.

12:32.404 --> 12:34.272
Yeah, all the balls.
Yeah.

12:34.306 --> 12:35.973
Multiple balls.

12:36.008 --> 12:38.074
Because that's what assistants do.

12:38.108 --> 12:40.476
Good luck watchin'
all them balls, Steve.

12:40.511 --> 12:43.078
I'll watch as many as I want to.
Yeah, good luck with it.

12:43.112 --> 12:45.280
What's up, K.P.?

12:47.650 --> 12:52.787
<i>The trident... Poseidon, the god
of the ocean's, weapon of choice.</i>

12:52.821 --> 12:56.423
<i>Ancient mermen used to use this
weapon in battle to fight against</i>

12:56.457 --> 12:59.659
<i>the crustacean armies and all the
shrimps and jellyfish in the sea.</i>

12:59.693 --> 13:03.762
I often come out here to this
abandoned cement factory,

13:03.796 --> 13:07.398
to harness its power,
learn its secrets,

13:07.432 --> 13:09.900
think about life,
think about the game.

13:09.935 --> 13:12.335
They're the same thing, you know?

13:12.370 --> 13:14.203
Heads up.

13:14.238 --> 13:16.038
Nice hands.

13:16.072 --> 13:18.073
Now, listen to what I have to say.

13:18.107 --> 13:22.042
I'm about to teach you some things
that can't be taught, Ivan.

13:22.076 --> 13:24.343
Do you see the yonder peaks
of this ancient building?

13:24.377 --> 13:25.444
Do you mean the roof?

13:25.478 --> 13:26.812
- Yes.
- Yeah.

13:26.846 --> 13:29.647
I need you to scale this and
find your way to the peak.

13:29.681 --> 13:32.849
No, I can't. That
is impossible, I can't do it.

13:32.883 --> 13:34.551
You won't climb up that thing?

13:34.585 --> 13:36.685
I ca, can't. It's
too, too tall.

13:36.720 --> 13:37.720
Fine.

13:37.754 --> 13:38.988
Do you see there?

13:39.023 --> 13:41.790
That weird dark, cavernous
area that's kind of scary?

13:41.824 --> 13:47.028
In order to become a man, and on the team, you
have to crawl into there and murder a rat.

13:47.063 --> 13:49.797
Everyone on the
team has done this before.

13:49.831 --> 13:51.699
No.

13:51.733 --> 13:53.967
How am I supposed to mentor you if you're
not gonna do any of the exercises,

13:54.001 --> 13:57.136
or, or transitions that
I've thought up...of?

13:57.170 --> 13:59.038
Give me something else, man, I can't...
All right, fine.

13:59.073 --> 14:04.510
How about you just...at a brisk pace run
up that ramp and take your shirt off?

14:04.544 --> 14:06.277
Why would I...why should
I take my shirt off?

14:06.311 --> 14:08.146
Just because. Why
wouldn't you do that?

14:08.180 --> 14:10.414
This is... I'm tryin' to teach you fuckin'
lessons that can't be taught here.

14:10.448 --> 14:12.816
You think fuckin' Luke Skywalker
would've learned anything from Yoda,

14:12.851 --> 14:15.985
if he would've kept saying, "No," every
time he fuckin' asked him to do something?

14:16.020 --> 14:17.053
Luke Skywalker?

14:17.088 --> 14:19.955
From fucking <i>Star Wars,</i> dawg!

14:19.989 --> 14:23.190
You know what? Fuck this.
Obviously, you don't want to fuckin' learn.

14:25.060 --> 14:27.526
You're sending me a
mixed signal, you know?

14:27.561 --> 14:29.728
Don't try to outsmart me, mister.

14:29.763 --> 14:31.262
I'm a fucking writer!

14:31.296 --> 14:32.764
Yeah, and I'm deejay, bro.

14:32.798 --> 14:34.431
All right, fine.

14:34.465 --> 14:37.667
You think you can fucking fly solo, you
could do this on your own? Go for it.

14:37.702 --> 14:41.170
Good. I don't need lessons
from fucking has-been.

14:42.838 --> 14:45.240
- What'd you just say?
- You heard what I said, bro.

14:45.274 --> 14:46.508
No, I didn't hear what you just said.

14:46.542 --> 14:47.908
I called you a
fuckin' has-been.

14:47.943 --> 14:49.477
A has-been?
Yes.

14:49.511 --> 14:52.345
And I'm gonna assume that there was
something lost in translation.

14:52.379 --> 14:57.683
In Russia, a has-been is someone who
once was great, but is now shit.

14:57.717 --> 15:00.718
That's exactly the same thing
it means in America as well.

15:00.753 --> 15:02.921
That's why I said it.

15:02.955 --> 15:04.689
You better fucking think again, bro.

15:04.723 --> 15:07.025
I'm the most famous person
the Mermen has on the team.

15:07.059 --> 15:08.159
The next one up to the Majors.

15:08.193 --> 15:09.727
We shall see about that, my friend.

15:09.761 --> 15:11.529
You're seeing about it right now!

15:11.563 --> 15:13.497
I'm the fuckin' team leader.
I'm the franchise star player.

15:13.531 --> 15:14.932
You see it, saw it, sawn it!

15:14.966 --> 15:16.732
You're fuckin' done. You're blind now.
I just won the argument.

15:16.767 --> 15:18.201
And let me tell you something.

15:18.235 --> 15:20.869
I hope you pitch better
than your mouth works.

15:20.904 --> 15:27.241
Because for me, my mouth is
not as good as my arm, right?

15:27.276 --> 15:28.842
Fuckin' through your face and dead.

15:28.876 --> 15:30.577
Yeah, if I had the gun, I'm like...

15:30.611 --> 15:32.412
Pfft! Fuckin' gun's
ch...chopped in half,

15:32.446 --> 15:34.780
electricity comes in, into your face.
Oh, two guns.

15:34.814 --> 15:37.082
And that one's done, too. Inside of you.

15:37.116 --> 15:38.750
And now you're a fuckin' puppet.

15:38.784 --> 15:40.885
I can bounce this around, you're
a goddamn puppet. You are.

15:40.920 --> 15:42.319
Smash your fucking face in!

15:42.353 --> 15:45.522
You are like baby. So, I wish you...

15:45.555 --> 15:49.158
Nothing but the best of luck.
Because you're going to need it.

15:49.192 --> 15:51.393
Pssh, don't try to fuckin'
wish me good luck.

15:52.695 --> 15:56.130
Fuck! What the f...

15:56.165 --> 15:59.032
Let's go. Hey, man, don't fuck around.
Don't fuck around, man!

15:59.066 --> 16:01.234
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

16:01.268 --> 16:05.738
You're my fucking ride!
Fuck you, motherfucker!

16:11.876 --> 16:15.110
Andrea?

16:15.144 --> 16:17.078
Is this Andrea's classroom?

16:17.113 --> 16:20.614
Andrea? Is this Andrea's
classroom? There you are.

16:20.648 --> 16:22.049
Sir, it's a closed session.

16:22.083 --> 16:23.717
Eat shit, fucker.

16:23.751 --> 16:27.188
Andrea, you made a promise
to me, and now unfortunately,

16:27.222 --> 16:29.189
I have to collect upon that promise.

16:29.223 --> 16:31.424
Are you ready to believe in me?

16:35.796 --> 16:37.095
No?

16:37.129 --> 16:39.330
I'm in class right now.

16:43.668 --> 16:46.769
I'm slowly realizing
this. Uh...

16:46.804 --> 16:49.738
Don't whisper. Don't, nobody
needs to be whispering, okay?

16:49.772 --> 16:51.373
This is serious.

16:51.407 --> 16:53.574
We're, we're talking about
our relationship here.

16:53.608 --> 16:56.110
Can we talk about this later?

16:56.145 --> 16:57.244
Okay, cool.

16:57.278 --> 16:59.179
Well, I'm probably just freakin' out.

16:59.213 --> 17:01.580
I got a lot of emotional baggage and shit
that I've been dealing with lately so...

17:01.614 --> 17:05.017
I'm not some needy, old dude rushing
into a classroom, asking for confidence.

17:05.050 --> 17:08.353
That's
not me. That's not me.

17:08.387 --> 17:10.820
I'm gonna go to the game
now, guys. I'm gonna be fine.

17:10.855 --> 17:14.458
Nobody worry about me. I got
this shit fuckin' cinched.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.660
All right...

17:16.694 --> 17:19.762
That, that's, that's it. You, you sure you
don't want to come right now, just to...

17:19.797 --> 17:22.498
Just...you're busy.
You guys are...okay.

17:28.771 --> 17:31.706
What the fuck is this
<i>Romper Room</i> bullshit?

17:31.740 --> 17:34.342
Stevie!
Steven!

17:34.376 --> 17:36.209
Oh, Kenny, I didn't hear you come in.

17:36.243 --> 17:38.411
I need you to explain
this. What is this?

17:38.445 --> 17:40.479
Well, this is
retro-baby chic.

17:40.513 --> 17:44.148
I modeled this after a spread I saw
in the latest <i>Southern Living.</i>

17:44.182 --> 17:46.583
Do you like it?
Let me think about that for a second.

17:46.618 --> 17:48.384
No, I fuckin' hate it!

17:48.418 --> 17:50.953
Tear it down.
Start over! Restart!

17:50.987 --> 17:56.056
Okay, right now is one of those times
where I'm feeling a little disrespected.

17:56.090 --> 17:59.159
I mean, first I come down here and you're
running around with some other guy,

17:59.194 --> 18:01.093
and calling him your best friend.

18:01.128 --> 18:03.695
And now you want me to
redo all this hard work?

18:03.730 --> 18:05.796
I just feel, hmm...

18:05.831 --> 18:10.834
Like my feelings, uh...
aren't being taken into consideration.

18:10.869 --> 18:14.937
I'm sorry, Stevie, that I am not taking
your feelings into consideration.

18:14.972 --> 18:17.873
Thank you. I'm sorry that
you decorated the room shittily.

18:17.908 --> 18:19.942
I'm sorry Shane
is my best friend.

18:19.976 --> 18:25.013
And most importantly, I'm sorry that I
just broke this silly fucking lamp!

18:27.082 --> 18:29.582
Because my whole goddamn reign of
power's being challenged here, Stevie!

18:29.616 --> 18:33.919
I don't want my dojo to look like the place
the Cabbage Patch Kids come to fuck.

18:33.953 --> 18:37.389
Now this Russian's here and he
might almost be as good as me.

18:37.423 --> 18:40.024
It makes me nervous.

18:40.058 --> 18:42.226
I've never heard you say
you were nervous before.

18:42.260 --> 18:45.028
Well, it's because I've never
been nervous before, Stevie.

18:45.063 --> 18:46.528
Does Shane know?

18:46.563 --> 18:48.564
Of course not! I'm not tryin' to
look like a bitch in front of Shane.

18:48.598 --> 18:52.433
He's my best friend.
He's not someone I say things to.

18:52.468 --> 18:56.636
Okay. Okay.

18:58.139 --> 18:59.605
You know, Kenny,

18:59.639 --> 19:02.307
back in high school I used to
watch you walk through the halls.

19:02.341 --> 19:06.177
And I'd say, "There goes the coolest,
cockiest kid in the world."

19:06.211 --> 19:08.912
But you're no longer
a kid anymore, Kenny.

19:08.946 --> 19:11.014
You're a man.

19:11.048 --> 19:17.585
And I guess all that coolness and
cockiness has, uh...transformed.

19:17.619 --> 19:25.558
But it's transformed...into
something far, more, powerful.

19:25.592 --> 19:28.827
Battle Hardened Confidence!

19:28.861 --> 19:33.464
Now I have seen you face
adversity with April,

19:33.498 --> 19:38.001
your career, marketing, and Mecans.

19:38.035 --> 19:42.237
And you. You always
emerge victorious.

19:42.272 --> 19:48.176
I didn't just come down to Myrtle for
adventure and possibly cheating on my wife.

19:48.210 --> 19:51.611
No. I came
down here...

19:51.645 --> 19:55.814
To be...
inspired.

20:00.018 --> 20:02.219
I gotta admit, Stevie.

20:02.253 --> 20:04.388
I didn't think you had what
it takes to deliver a

20:04.422 --> 20:06.922
heartwarming, inspirational speech.

20:06.957 --> 20:08.357
Thank you.

20:08.391 --> 20:11.926
Because of your words,
I'm now ready to destroy.

20:11.961 --> 20:13.562
You need to fucking destroy now.

20:13.596 --> 20:16.731
I'm sorry for hurting your feelings, and
destroying that fucking dumbass lamp.

20:16.765 --> 20:18.865
Fuck my feelings, and fuck that lamp!

20:18.900 --> 20:22.636
You need to get to the fucking
stadium, and destroy!

20:22.670 --> 20:26.471
<i>The switch-hitting Jansen
stands in here, two on, top of the ninth.</i>

20:26.505 --> 20:28.172
<i>The stretch, the</i>
<i>pitch...swung on,</i>

20:28.206 --> 20:30.341
<i>- and lined to right field, base hit.
- Aw!</i>

20:30.375 --> 20:32.942
<i>Jorasco gets it in quickly...
Aw, come on!</i>

20:32.976 --> 20:34.343
Time!

20:43.184 --> 20:46.151
Powers, you're in.

20:52.691 --> 20:54.925
Welcome to America, baby dick.

21:01.431 --> 21:03.799
<i>So, the call has indeed
gone to the bullpen.</i>

21:03.833 --> 21:05.767
<i>There will be</i> <i>a pitching change.</i>

21:05.801 --> 21:08.869
<i>It is six-to-one, Mermen,</i>
<i>top of the ninth.</i>

21:13.240 --> 21:15.707
<i>And it's Kenny Powers!</i>

21:15.742 --> 21:19.344
<i>The big right-hander coming in</i>
<i>to shut the door once again.</i>

21:23.415 --> 21:26.015
<i>And now,</i>
<i>pitching for the Mermen...</i>

21:26.050 --> 21:30.752
<i>Kenny Powers!</i>

21:30.787 --> 21:33.122
All right
now, here we go.

21:33.156 --> 21:36.290
You ready to show this Russian motherfucker
how we do this shit in the States?

21:36.325 --> 21:37.458
You're goddamn right.

21:37.493 --> 21:39.225
Well, show me what you got, Goose.

21:39.260 --> 21:41.561
I told you, I'm Tom Cruise.

21:41.595 --> 21:43.295
I'm gonna let you think
you are, but you're not.

21:43.329 --> 21:45.397
Guess what? I am Tom Cruise.
You're not.

21:45.431 --> 21:47.064
Tom Cruise.
Strike this motherfucker out.

21:47.098 --> 21:49.166
Tom Cruise. Thanks, Goose. No.

21:49.201 --> 21:50.901
I'm out of earshot.

21:57.539 --> 21:59.906
Go ahead and strike this pussy out.

21:59.941 --> 22:01.909
I was
talking to you.

22:06.180 --> 22:07.879
Here we go.

22:20.192 --> 22:22.125
Strike one!
 Yeah!

22:22.160 --> 22:24.061
Fuck yeah!

22:35.405 --> 22:37.239
Strike two!

22:42.343 --> 22:46.379
Hey, that ain't distracting you, is it?
Huh? You're gonna be all right.

22:46.414 --> 22:51.550
Kenny! Kenny!
Kenny! Kenny! Kenny! Kenny!

22:51.584 --> 22:54.118
Kenny! Kenny! Kenny!

23:20.238 --> 23:24.040
Aw! Get the
fuck out of here!

23:26.844 --> 23:28.610
God damn it.

23:45.626 --> 23:46.893
Fuck.

23:56.635 --> 23:58.536
Here he comes.
I'm sure he doesn't know...

23:58.570 --> 24:01.404
He just gonna come up here, and probably just
give you a little chit-chat. That's all.

24:01.438 --> 24:04.641
Powers, thank you, but we won't be needing
your services the rest of the evening.

24:04.675 --> 24:06.608
Damn it! You've got to
be fucking kidding me!

24:06.643 --> 24:08.043
One fucking hit.
Are you serious?

24:08.078 --> 24:09.711
You've been preoccupied
all goddamn week...

24:09.745 --> 24:12.246
Pulling your dick, messing
around, monkey-shining.

24:12.281 --> 24:14.314
I'm gonna give the new guy a chance.

24:14.348 --> 24:15.581
The new guy?

24:15.616 --> 24:17.316
Hey, don't fuckin' sass me, okay?

24:17.351 --> 24:19.184
Texas is here. You're gonna
squat fuck me in front of them?

24:19.218 --> 24:21.953
I don't have to fight with you guys.
Get off the fuckin' mound.

24:21.988 --> 24:23.220
Dick.
Move it...

24:23.255 --> 24:28.858
Fuckin' piece of shit.
Fuckin' racist cocksucking...

24:28.893 --> 24:31.527
Send in
the fuckin' commie!

24:31.561 --> 24:33.596
Ignorant choices!

24:45.272 --> 24:48.874
We'll see. We'll see how
the fuckin' Russian fares.

24:53.245 --> 24:54.745
Here we go, Ivan!

24:54.780 --> 24:56.779
Come on, Ivan.

24:56.814 --> 24:58.181
Darnell, what the fuck?

25:30.038 --> 25:31.238
Whoa!

25:37.444 --> 25:38.911
Yeah!

25:45.184 --> 25:46.584
Goddamn!

25:52.158 --> 25:54.593
<i>Da! Da!</i>

25:57.062 --> 25:59.996
One fucking game, man.
One fucking game, okay? Who cares?

26:00.030 --> 26:02.398
Don't let that commie prick rattle you!
Not for one second, you hear me?

26:02.433 --> 26:04.733
This is too much, I'm just getting
thrown a bunch of things at once.

26:04.768 --> 26:07.502
April, this fucking kid is here,
this fuckin' Russian person!

26:07.536 --> 26:09.704
Uh, it's just too much, it's too much, man!
Uh! Hey! Hey!

26:09.739 --> 26:11.205
Hey! You look at me!

26:11.240 --> 26:12.672
You look me right here in the
fuckin' eyes, Kenny, you hear me?

26:12.707 --> 26:14.441
Stop being a goddamn pussy.

26:14.475 --> 26:18.409
<i>You're fuckin' famous and
shit, and no one, no one can stop us.</i>

26:18.444 --> 26:20.744
Never say
die. Okay?

26:20.778 --> 26:22.345
Whoo!

26:22.380 --> 26:25.414
Hell, yeah! There you go! Stand up!
Stand up, and yell it in my face!

26:25.448 --> 26:27.549
Never say die!
Say it!

26:27.583 --> 26:29.650
Never say die!

26:29.684 --> 26:31.384
- Famous as shit!
- Never fucking die!

26:31.419 --> 26:33.652
Never say die!

26:33.687 --> 26:34.853
Never die!

26:34.888 --> 26:37.054
Goddamn it, that's fuckin' right!

26:37.088 --> 26:40.223
Now, how's about I cut us a couple more monster
rails for us young fuckin' bloods, huh?

26:40.258 --> 26:42.091
- Oh, I fuckin' like that.
- All right.

26:42.125 --> 26:44.493
I'm gonna change this fuckin' shitty
song for somethin' more coke worthy!

26:44.527 --> 26:46.527
Fuck yeah! Fuck this shit! Whoo!

26:46.561 --> 26:49.496
That's what I'm talkin' about.
Talkin' about dope beads, fat lines, and tight friends.

26:49.531 --> 26:52.200
We are fuckin' celebrities, yo!

26:52.234 --> 26:54.101
Mmm-hmm. Whoo!

26:54.135 --> 26:56.303
Well, I don't even know who
half these fuckin' bands even are.

26:56.338 --> 26:59.840
Yeah, I know, baby, I went crazy on Limewire
in the early days, that's what that was...

26:59.874 --> 27:02.875
Oh, shit! I fuckin' love this song.
