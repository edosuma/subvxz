45:22.470 --> 45:25.007
For example, what is love?

45:26.224 --> 45:28.385
Is it something
we are born with?

45:28.517 --> 45:30.428
Or can it be learned?

45:34.357 --> 45:36.894
Panties down, not off.

45:40.446 --> 45:42.528
And what about
the darker feelings?

45:42.657 --> 45:45.069
Fear? Anger? Violence?

45:45.201 --> 45:48.034
Human consciousness
is not complete without them.

45:53.376 --> 45:57.210
And memory.
Ours are subjective, fallible.

45:58.214 --> 46:00.956
But how do you teach
a computer to forget?

46:03.552 --> 46:05.838
Or to dream?

46:05.972 --> 46:07.928
Itâ€™s something our minds
need to do.

46:09.433 --> 46:12.596
Would a conscious synth
have to be able to dream?

46:12.728 --> 46:14.639
To have nightmares?

46:20.236 --> 46:23.478
Of course not.
Theyâ€™re just machines.
