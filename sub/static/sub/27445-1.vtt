-and so many murders.

18:54.394 --> 18:57.353
Okay, guys. We just have time
for one more question.

Yes, I have a question. Um...

19:07.537 --> 19:09.539
how much did
your first camera cost?

19:12.020 --> 19:14.370
Interesting story.

19:14.414 --> 19:17.373
I actually got it from...

19:31.518 --> 19:35.130
The reporter who asked you
that question was me?

19:39.308 --> 19:40.570

23:03.599 --> 23:07.995
What? We have
the best love story

23:08.038 --> 23:12.521
