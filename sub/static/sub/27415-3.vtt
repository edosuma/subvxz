WEBVTT

00:20.800 --> 00:25.620
OK, that's enough, I think.
I'll just take that up to there.

00:25.720 --> 00:29.480
Alright. Let's get you
all nice and dry, OK?

00:30.920 --> 00:34.620
Relax, Farida. It's nothing
I haven't seen before.

00:34.720 --> 00:37.220
You're definitely not my type.

00:37.320 --> 00:38.900
I've got it. I've got it.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.660
OK.

00:40.760 --> 00:43.300
Oops-a-daisy.

00:43.400 --> 00:48.140
Ohhh, there we go.

00:48.240 --> 00:52.800
OK.
Some low-hanging fruit there.

00:54.520 --> 00:56.680
Is this all you've got?

00:57.800 --> 01:00.780
It's all so sad.

01:00.880 --> 01:06.020
I think we need to work on
your fashion a little bit.

01:06.120 --> 01:08.900
Yeah. So I hear your son's
coming to visit.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.160
That's exciting, isn't it?

02:57.080 --> 02:59.080
She's dying.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
I can feel it.

03:03.800 --> 03:05.800
I can feel it too.

03:07.640 --> 03:11.780
No, no, no, no, no, no, this
can't be it, this can't be it.

03:11.880 --> 03:13.460
There needs to be another one.

03:13.560 --> 03:16.900
There needs to be more,
you need to find me another one.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.940
Ray, you need to go and find me
another one.

03:19.040 --> 03:20.820
You need to find me
another one!

03:20.920 --> 03:22.620
-Hey, hey!
-FIND ME ANOTHER ONE!

03:22.720 --> 03:25.260
OK, OK, hey, come here,
come here, come here, come here!

03:25.360 --> 03:27.100
Just... It's OK.

03:27.200 --> 03:31.800
I'll be back. I'll fix this.
Just don't leave the house.

03:33.400 --> 03:35.400
Don't leave the house.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.800
Shit!

04:44.120 --> 04:46.320
Ray. How can I help you?

04:49.840 --> 04:52.240
Ray, whatever's the matter?

04:53.880 --> 04:57.700
I'm sorry, Loris.
Where did he die - Brett?

04:57.800 --> 05:01.580
After the flood, where was
his body found

05:01.680 --> 05:03.460
-That's... No, I...
-Or outside?

05:03.560 --> 05:05.740
I'm not going to discuss this
with you.

05:05.840 --> 05:08.320
For goodness sake,
what have you lost?

05:09.360 --> 05:11.300
Ray!

05:11.400 --> 05:14.580
This is absurd!
What are you looking for?

05:14.680 --> 05:16.420
Where was your brother found,
Loris?

05:16.520 --> 05:19.060
I know how awful this sounds
but where was he found?

05:19.160 --> 05:23.260
He was trying to save the church
but I don't know where he died.

05:23.360 --> 05:26.060
And I don't think you should be
asking me these questions.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.160
It's insulting.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.660
I guess I was mistaken.

05:31.760 --> 05:33.760
I'm sorry.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.560
The Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost, amen.

05:56.160 --> 06:01.580
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

06:01.680 --> 06:03.680
Yeah, really?

06:06.280 --> 06:08.900
And what did you do, old man?

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
I...

06:11.760 --> 06:13.700
..miss him, Father.

06:17.480 --> 06:18.780
I miss him.

06:27.520 --> 06:31.040
This acquaintance of yours,
mate, um, Sam.

06:32.480 --> 06:35.420
What exactly did you two
get up to together,

06:35.520 --> 06:37.380
besides stealing cars?

06:37.480 --> 06:40.740
We shared a bottle of Scotch.

06:40.840 --> 06:44.600
-Scotch?
-Whisky, actually.

06:47.600 --> 06:49.920
Did he ever attempt anything...

06:51.200 --> 06:53.460
..inappropriate with you?

06:53.560 --> 06:55.980
He let me drive
Uncle Charlie's car.

06:56.080 --> 06:57.540
He let you drive
his uncle's car?

06:57.640 --> 06:59.220
Mm.

06:59.320 --> 07:02.360
There's no uncle.
Uncle Charlie's a lie.

07:03.960 --> 07:06.820
Look, mate, this is
a very unstable person

07:06.920 --> 07:08.700
that we're talking about, OK,

07:08.800 --> 07:11.340
who is connected to
a seriously dangerous criminal.

07:11.440 --> 07:13.580
Connected how?

07:13.680 --> 07:15.900
Connected... Just connected.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.180
You mean like a thoracopagus?

07:18.280 --> 07:21.020
-A... A what?
-Conjoined twins.

07:21.120 --> 07:23.340
In order for that, they'd need
to be the same age...

07:23.440 --> 07:24.860
Isaac, I'm being serious, mate.

07:24.960 --> 07:26.960
You need to tell me where he is.

07:28.760 --> 07:32.600
Never rat on your mates,
specially not to cops.

07:34.560 --> 07:36.560
Did Sam teach you that?

08:44.240 --> 08:46.540
That whole thing about you
drinking whisky.

08:46.640 --> 08:49.300
That was a joke, right?

08:49.400 --> 08:51.820
-Because you never lie.
-No.

08:51.920 --> 08:53.860
-But you do.
-Excuse me?

08:53.960 --> 08:56.300
You said she was only going to
the shops, but she wasn't.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.920
What

09:01.760 --> 09:03.780
Hi, Viv.

09:03.880 --> 09:05.880
Huh?

09:09.280 --> 09:11.280
No way.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Where are you going?

11:39.520 --> 11:42.880
Shame your career sort of
fizzled out, eh?

11:47.480 --> 11:51.620
I guess people
just...forgot about you.

11:51.720 --> 11:54.480
Fuck you.

12:00.560 --> 12:02.560
So long, Gwendolyn Reed.

12:05.800 --> 12:10.000
Like they say in Hollywood,
growing old's a bitch.

12:19.720 --> 12:22.700
-Wait, Sam, Sam!
-Ohhhh!

12:22.800 --> 12:25.620
Look what I found in Vivian's
room. Mum's mobile phone bill.

12:25.720 --> 12:27.580
Kid, just leave it alone,
already. Jesus!

12:27.680 --> 12:30.460
36 she got a call
from the hospital.

12:30.560 --> 12:31.940
It's 42 kilometres away.

12:32.040 --> 12:33.500
Mate, your mum's dead, alright?

12:33.600 --> 12:36.300
-Why would you say that?
-Just... Listen.

12:36.400 --> 12:39.620
Stay the fuck away.

12:39.720 --> 12:41.780
I'm not who you think I am.

12:41.880 --> 12:44.160
You don't scare me.

14:12.360 --> 14:14.360
Max.

14:23.240 --> 14:25.260
What is this?

14:25.360 --> 14:27.300
What are you?

14:27.400 --> 14:29.460
I'm me.

14:29.560 --> 14:31.960
I've never felt more me.

14:33.600 --> 14:36.100
Oh, Max.

14:36.200 --> 14:39.620
We loved each other once.

14:39.720 --> 14:43.000
-We can love each other again.
-No, no, no, no, no. No.

14:44.840 --> 14:46.840
Tell me...

14:48.520 --> 14:50.520
..how is this possible?

15:01.400 --> 15:03.400
Here.

15:04.680 --> 15:06.840
Trust me.

15:10.720 --> 15:12.720
Trust me.

15:33.720 --> 15:36.900
It's OK.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.120
Everything's gonna be OK.

15:55.800 --> 15:58.340
You stole from me.

15:58.440 --> 16:04.500
I...borrowed and I will pay you
back the...$40.

16:04.600 --> 16:06.600
-$65.
-$65.

16:08.120 --> 16:09.140
I promise.

16:09.240 --> 16:11.780
Oh, my God.

16:11.880 --> 16:13.580
Please tell me
you are not a junkie.

16:13.680 --> 16:15.880
Hey, I got you this.

16:16.960 --> 16:19.000
The number eight.

16:21.960 --> 16:24.740
Oh. Infinity.

16:24.840 --> 16:28.960
It means "without limits".

16:32.920 --> 16:36.320
So, your sister Karen.

16:37.440 --> 16:38.940
Where did she die?

16:39.040 --> 16:40.860
What?

16:40.960 --> 16:42.960
Your sister.

16:43.840 --> 16:46.460
Karen.

16:46.560 --> 16:47.700
Where did she die?

16:47.800 --> 16:49.380
What sort of sick question
is that?

16:49.480 --> 16:51.520
I just want to get to know you
better.

16:53.160 --> 16:56.180
Do you ever go visit her?

16:56.280 --> 16:59.560
Where she drowned, I mean,
specifically, the exact spot?

17:00.720 --> 17:02.020
Have you been drinking?

17:02.120 --> 17:03.900
Closure.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.780
Right?

17:05.880 --> 17:07.780
Closure.
That's what people need.

17:07.880 --> 17:10.980
That's what you need.

17:11.080 --> 17:15.000
And I can help you find closure.

17:16.360 --> 17:17.740
Tina.

17:17.840 --> 17:20.500
The river
on the other side of town.

17:20.600 --> 17:22.620
That's what I told everybody
but...

17:22.720 --> 17:23.940
But...?

17:24.040 --> 17:25.980
You're going to think
I'm the biggest loser

17:26.080 --> 17:29.740
-for staying with him.
-What?

17:29.840 --> 17:30.940
For staying with who?

17:31.040 --> 17:32.900
-My husband.
-Your husband?

17:33.000 --> 17:35.320
What's your husband
got to do with this?

17:36.400 --> 17:38.420
Tina.

17:38.520 --> 17:40.180
Tina, where?

17:40.280 --> 17:43.120
Where

17:49.600 --> 17:51.600
Gwen?

17:52.600 --> 17:54.600
Gwen?

17:55.480 --> 17:57.480
Gwen?

18:05.080 --> 18:07.080
Max?

18:09.280 --> 18:11.280
Max?

18:13.280 --> 18:15.180
Max?

18:15.280 --> 18:17.280
Gwen?

18:51.840 --> 18:53.840
Ray.

18:57.480 --> 18:59.520
Max?

19:04.240 --> 19:05.420
What are you doing?

19:05.520 --> 19:07.880
She's staying here with me.

19:12.960 --> 19:14.100
We're going right now.

19:14.200 --> 19:16.660
Didn't you hear me?

19:16.760 --> 19:18.580
She's not herself,
you can see that.

19:18.680 --> 19:21.980
-Of course she's herself.
-Ray, please, you have to go.

19:22.080 --> 19:23.620
-We're going now.
-Stop!

19:23.720 --> 19:25.100
-You're coming with me.
-No!

19:25.200 --> 19:28.220
I can't explain it
but you need to go.

19:28.320 --> 19:30.220
-I just need you to...
-You're coming home.

19:30.320 --> 19:33.220
No, Ray, I'm not.

19:33.320 --> 19:35.340
Please.

19:35.440 --> 19:38.420
Please, you have to go.

19:38.520 --> 19:41.520
I'm coming back.

19:42.760 --> 19:44.760
I'm coming back.

21:17.400 --> 21:19.020
Ray.

21:19.120 --> 21:23.340
Something very strange
is going on.

21:23.440 --> 21:27.100
Sarge, Brydon does have a son
and his name is Sam.

21:27.200 --> 21:28.420
But he's dead.

21:28.520 --> 21:31.300
So what I'm thinking is that
it's not a father/son job,

21:31.400 --> 21:32.980
but a grandfather/grandson job.

21:33.080 --> 21:34.580
Dave, now's not a good time.

21:34.680 --> 21:36.460
Senior Constable
David Griffiths.

21:36.560 --> 21:39.380
-Er, yeah.
-Detective Han Zhen. Homicide.

21:39.480 --> 21:41.640
You and I have a lot
to talk about.

21:45.080 --> 21:47.080
It's just up here.

21:51.400 --> 21:53.860
Oh, my God. Are you OK?

21:53.960 --> 21:56.020
-We're really close.
-Good.

21:56.120 --> 21:58.280
It's a little abandoned.

22:00.320 --> 22:02.660
I don't come here anymore.

22:02.760 --> 22:04.820
It's where my husband
was fucking my sister

22:04.920 --> 22:07.740
on the morning of the flood.

22:07.840 --> 22:10.320
Your husband was fucking
your sister?

22:25.320 --> 22:28.720
-Oh, my God!

22:30.840 --> 22:33.020
What... What are you doing?

22:33.120 --> 22:34.900
I'm just...
I'm looking for proof

22:35.000 --> 22:37.140
of your husband
and sister's affair,

22:37.240 --> 22:38.940
of their filthy, lying,
dirty sex,

22:39.040 --> 22:40.900
of your whore of a sister.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.660
She wasn't a whore,
she was divorced,

22:42.760 --> 22:45.500
she couldn't help herself.
All the boys in school...

22:45.600 --> 22:46.900
This isn't good for you, OK...

22:47.000 --> 22:48.900
..they went to her
except for Griffo...

22:49.000 --> 22:51.060
-This is sick!
-I know.

22:51.160 --> 22:54.260
No, you're sick,
letting her do that to you.

22:54.360 --> 22:56.980
Look, I know, I know,
I know she's dead,

22:57.080 --> 22:59.060
but unless you let yourself
hate her,

22:59.160 --> 23:02.500
then you're gonna die too, OK?
Say it with me.

23:02.600 --> 23:04.140
"Fuck Karen."

23:04.240 --> 23:06.660
Come on, say it with me.
"Fuck Karen."

23:06.760 --> 23:08.020
No, I can't say it.

23:08.120 --> 23:09.780
-"Fuck Karen."
-I can't.

23:09.880 --> 23:12.100
Come on, you've got to
let it out there.

23:12.200 --> 23:14.020
Come on, you've got to
let it out, unleash it,

23:14.120 --> 23:16.100
let me hear you,
you've got to let it out!

23:16.200 --> 23:18.180
-Fuck Karen!
-Fuck Karen!

23:18.280 --> 23:19.940
-Fuck Karen.
-Fuck Karen!

23:20.040 --> 23:23.100
FUCK KAREN! FUCK HER!

23:23.200 --> 23:24.860
-That's right. Fuck Karen.
-Fuck her!

23:24.960 --> 23:27.500
FUCK! FUCK KAREN!

23:27.600 --> 23:29.180
-Fuck Karen.
-Fuck her.

23:29.280 --> 23:30.980
Fuck Karen!

23:31.080 --> 23:34.060
Fuck you, Karen!

23:34.160 --> 23:36.380
Fuck Karen.
-TINA: Fuck Karen!

23:36.480 --> 23:37.980
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

23:38.080 --> 23:41.180
We should fucking...
We should burn it down.

23:41.280 --> 23:44.060
I just need you
to calm down just a little, OK?

23:44.160 --> 23:47.460
-OK.
-Count to ten. One...

23:47.560 --> 23:51.500
-Two, three, four...
-Five...

23:51.600 --> 23:53.660
-Fuck you, Karen.
-Fuck you, Karen, to the bush.

23:53.760 --> 23:56.060
-Fuck you, Karen, to the bush.
-Fuck you, Karen, to the bush.

23:56.160 --> 23:58.160
Fuck you, Karen!

24:59.480 --> 25:01.700
You gave me this album
for my 18th birthday.

25:01.800 --> 25:04.820
-Do you remember that?
-Of course I remember.

25:04.920 --> 25:08.140
That was the first time
that we did it.

25:08.240 --> 25:10.180
In the milking shed.

25:10.280 --> 25:13.100
Oh, Gwen, you're gonna ruin me.

25:13.200 --> 25:15.940
-Hey, our song!
-What?

25:16.040 --> 25:18.560
Your song. Remember?

25:19.640 --> 25:21.640
Where is it?

25:31.760 --> 25:36.040
Ohhh! You little beauty!

25:45.640 --> 25:47.980
-Wow!
-Remember this?

25:48.080 --> 25:50.420
Yeah, of course.
You still have it.

25:50.520 --> 25:53.160
Yeah. My four chords.

25:54.680 --> 25:57.380
Your
farewell song.

25:57.480 --> 26:00.220
-Farewell?
-Little Wings.

26:00.320 --> 26:01.780
Ah.

26:01.880 --> 26:04.020
I was so proud of you.

26:04.120 --> 26:07.180
The start of you
chasing your dreams.

26:07.280 --> 26:09.980
Going off to the big smoke.

26:10.080 --> 26:12.080
The rest of the world.

26:12.880 --> 26:16.320
It was the best
and the worst time.

27:03.600 --> 27:08.000
I thought it was her.
It sounded like her.

27:10.240 --> 27:12.440
It looked like her.

27:14.320 --> 27:16.320
Bugger me.

27:17.640 --> 27:19.640
Do you mind if I...?

27:20.840 --> 27:22.840
No, go ahead.

27:32.280 --> 27:34.280
No.

27:35.640 --> 27:40.500
So Gwen's young again
and she's with Max Mckinnon?

27:40.600 --> 27:43.140
And he's young too.

27:43.240 --> 27:44.900
But it didn't work on you?

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
Obviously.

27:47.680 --> 27:50.260
Bugger me.

27:50.360 --> 27:53.780
Whatever she's doing, whoever
she's with, it's my fault.

27:53.880 --> 27:56.700
I gave it to her.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.760
She needs this, Viv. It's
brought her back to life again.

28:05.360 --> 28:08.100
Yes, I know it was
Brydon's prints that came back

28:08.200 --> 28:10.180
but I didn't arrest him.

28:10.280 --> 28:13.120
-The bloke I locked up...
-Jack Meoff?

28:16.960 --> 28:19.860
I know how it sounds, I do,

28:19.960 --> 28:23.140
but how else
am I meant to explain this?

28:23.240 --> 28:24.580
I was the only one here.

28:24.680 --> 28:27.300
You are aware that your CCTV
wasn't operational?

28:27.400 --> 28:28.940
It hasn't worked
since the flood.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.580
This is Mullan,
it's not the CIA.

28:30.680 --> 28:32.140
You know what I think, David?

28:32.240 --> 28:35.940
I think you've had
a really tough year.

28:36.040 --> 28:38.040
Yeah.

28:39.200 --> 28:41.200
Yeah, it's been a nightmare.

28:42.800 --> 28:47.380
My wife lost her sister. It's
been very difficult at home.

28:47.480 --> 28:50.420
Suspension for stealing
from a crime scene.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.940
Working under the influence
of an illicit substance.

28:53.040 --> 28:56.020
Oh, no, that...
That didn't happen.

28:56.120 --> 28:58.120
It's in your record.

28:59.280 --> 29:01.220
OK, well, it happened.

29:01.320 --> 29:04.900
See, maybe Brydon offered you
a way out,

29:05.000 --> 29:08.080
a way out of this town,
this job.

29:09.200 --> 29:11.200
It'd be very hard to resist.

29:12.280 --> 29:15.260
Are you saying he tried
to pay me off?

29:15.360 --> 29:19.380
Ah! Ah-ah-ah!

29:31.200 --> 29:33.400
That was so primal.

29:37.120 --> 29:39.760
Thank you, Sam.

29:43.280 --> 29:45.280
Isaac.

29:46.200 --> 29:47.660
Tina.

29:47.760 --> 29:49.980
I promised I'd help him.

29:50.080 --> 29:52.120
Where are you going?

29:53.880 --> 29:56.040
I've got to find him.

29:57.240 --> 29:59.660
OK, bye.

29:59.760 --> 30:02.500
The
national anthem of Brazil.

30:32.480 --> 30:35.020
Hey, kid!

30:35.120 --> 30:37.400
Oi! Hey, kid!

30:48.600 --> 30:50.960
Ohhh, shit!

31:21.800 --> 31:23.940
What's wrong

31:24.040 --> 31:27.780
Thank you so much, ma'am,
that's very kind.

31:27.880 --> 31:29.980
Do you need a lift

31:30.080 --> 31:32.300
I think I've done me Achilles.

31:32.400 --> 31:33.940
Oh, yeah.

31:34.040 --> 31:35.860
Argh!

31:35.960 --> 31:37.580
-I appreciate it.
-OK.

31:40.080 --> 31:41.820
Thank you so much. Truly.

31:41.920 --> 31:45.080
-I really appreciate it.

31:50.640 --> 31:52.640
Hey, hey!

31:57.160 --> 31:59.500
Hey! Hey!

32:18.560 --> 32:20.560
Just put her over there.

32:23.520 --> 32:25.860
Can you just back her up?

32:25.960 --> 32:28.700
I want her right in the corner.
Yep, that's it.

32:28.800 --> 32:32.580
And then... No...
Back and then come to me.

32:32.680 --> 32:35.100
Yes. Now back.

32:35.200 --> 32:36.860
You've driven a car,
haven't you?

32:36.960 --> 32:38.980
Yes.
-OK, now back her up.

32:39.080 --> 32:41.020
-This way?
-That way, yes.

32:41.120 --> 32:42.980
And then just all the way back.

32:43.080 --> 32:46.020
I'm just gonna lift you up
on three, OK?

32:46.120 --> 32:48.300
One, two, three. OK.

32:48.400 --> 32:52.160
Oh, what have you been eating?
You stink, Reggie.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.880
OK, help me out, Reggie,
help me out, please.

33:04.760 --> 33:06.020
Feet up, please.

33:06.120 --> 33:08.120
Feet down.

33:16.720 --> 33:18.720
And we're off.

34:13.200 --> 34:15.280
This is real, isn't it?

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
I'm not dead?

34:25.480 --> 34:27.520
Max, I saw you.

34:28.840 --> 34:31.900
That morning in your shed.
Do you remember?

34:32.000 --> 34:34.480
-With your gun.
-Don't spoil it.

34:38.520 --> 34:40.640
Was it really that bad?

35:01.560 --> 35:03.560
I should have never let you go.

35:06.800 --> 35:08.840
I should've followed you.

35:10.640 --> 35:12.800
Stood up to your parents.

35:22.480 --> 35:25.220
Max, promise me.

35:25.320 --> 35:29.420
Promise me that you'll never,
ever try it again.

35:29.520 --> 35:31.500
I'll never.

35:31.600 --> 35:33.600
I'll never.

35:35.480 --> 35:37.520
You saved me.

35:39.480 --> 35:41.480
Look at us now.

35:45.080 --> 35:47.520
Maybe this is bloody heaven.

36:13.640 --> 36:16.500
Tonight, the manhunt
continues for Tommy Brydon,

36:16.600 --> 36:18.380
lead suspect
in last week's murder

36:18.480 --> 36:19.660
of a Melbourne crime boss.

36:19.760 --> 36:22.620
Brydon, aged 68,
first served time

36:22.720 --> 36:24.700
for burglary
and aggravated assault.

36:24.800 --> 36:25.580
He was last sighted

36:25.680 --> 36:28.160
in the western district town
of Mullan.

36:30.640 --> 36:34.320
-Police are asking anyone...

36:42.480 --> 36:45.580
You say you spent the night
in the office, Dave?

36:45.680 --> 36:47.100
That's right.

36:47.200 --> 36:51.500
Because of tension at home?

36:51.600 --> 36:53.620
Yes.

36:53.720 --> 36:56.580
What sort of tension, Dave?

36:56.680 --> 36:59.740
I told you, mate. It's personal.

36:59.840 --> 37:02.180
-Was it financial?
-No.

37:02.280 --> 37:05.380
-Were you fighting over money?
-No!

37:05.480 --> 37:08.340
-And then you woke up here.
-Yes, Rhonda woke me up.

37:08.440 --> 37:10.380
I've told you that
a million times, mate.

37:10.480 --> 37:11.700
I woke up,

37:11.800 --> 37:13.820
the bloke in the cell that I locked
up the night before was gone

37:13.920 --> 37:16.900
and in his place was
a naked derro, OK?

37:17.000 --> 37:19.860
That's all I know. What else
do you want me to say?

37:19.960 --> 37:22.580
That somehow the kid
just turned into the old man?

37:22.680 --> 37:25.860
What, that he had
a rough night's sleep,

37:25.960 --> 37:27.580
that he aged?

37:27.680 --> 37:29.720
That he's the same person?

37:31.000 --> 37:34.020
Well, Ethical Standards
will have to...

37:34.120 --> 37:35.420
Sorry to interrupt.

37:35.520 --> 37:37.660
We've got an MVA
out in the Old Mullan Road.

37:37.760 --> 37:40.080
-Griffo?
-Gladly.

38:02.200 --> 38:04.020
Oh, shit!
-I can't open the door!

38:04.120 --> 38:06.500
Oh, shit! Kid!

38:06.600 --> 38:08.600
KID!

38:09.600 --> 38:10.980
ISAAC!

38:13.840 --> 38:16.540
Isaac! Hey! Hey!

38:16.640 --> 38:18.300
-Kid!

38:18.400 --> 38:22.260
Oh, shit! Come on! Come on!

38:24.760 --> 38:26.700
Oh, shit.

38:32.160 --> 38:33.780
Oh, shit!

38:33.880 --> 38:36.860
Come on!

38:36.960 --> 38:39.900
Zacky, I've got you.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.500
Isaac. Isaac. It's OK.

38:43.600 --> 38:46.680
It's OK. Hey, Isaac.

38:49.720 --> 38:50.940
Oh, shit.

38:51.040 --> 38:52.940
Isaac. Isaac!

38:55.880 --> 38:57.880
Tommy!

38:59.720 --> 39:02.820
Tommy!

39:02.920 --> 39:04.920
Shit!

39:07.080 --> 39:10.380
Isaac! Mate, can you hear me?

39:10.480 --> 39:12.480
You right, mate?

41:18.040 --> 41:20.340
Gwen?

41:20.440 --> 41:22.440
Gwen!

41:35.200 --> 41:37.200
Max?

42:37.000 --> 42:38.220
Gwen?

42:38.320 --> 42:40.300
Stay in the house.
I'll deal with this.

42:40.400 --> 42:43.060
-Get out of the way.
-She's made her decision, Ray!

42:43.160 --> 42:45.460
I don't want to hurt you.

42:45.560 --> 42:48.980
Listen, Max, I don't know
where she got them,

42:49.080 --> 42:52.820
but when it wears off,
she is going to need me.

42:52.920 --> 42:54.920
What?

42:55.840 --> 42:59.820
She didn't tell you?
It doesn't last.

42:59.920 --> 43:01.420
-That's not right.
-It is.

43:01.520 --> 43:04.500
No, it's not 'cause this was
meant for us

43:04.600 --> 43:06.960
and the kid we were gonna have.

43:09.640 --> 43:11.640
You didn't know.

43:13.400 --> 43:15.400
Oh, Ray.

43:16.400 --> 43:19.240
Her parents made us
get rid of it.

43:20.400 --> 43:23.460
So this is our redemption.

43:23.560 --> 43:26.260
That's what this is, Ray.

43:26.360 --> 43:28.360
Redemption.

43:32.760 --> 43:35.000
Leave us alone, Ray.

44:05.680 --> 44:07.720
Is it true it doesn't last?

44:11.640 --> 44:13.640
Gwen?

44:24.600 --> 44:26.600
Why didn't you tell me?

44:43.040 --> 44:45.580
What's gonna happen?

44:45.680 --> 44:47.980
Gwen?

44:48.080 --> 44:50.760
It's gonna be fine.

44:52.400 --> 44:54.920
Don't worry about it.

44:57.160 --> 44:59.160
Trust me.

45:16.520 --> 45:18.560
I hope your husband
took the hint.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.600
Last thing you want
is your past coming round.

45:26.400 --> 45:28.520
Don't talk about Ray like that.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.440
Don't ever talk about Ray again.

46:02.240 --> 46:05.600
You throw like a pussy!

46:08.600 --> 46:11.380
-Whoo!
-Oh, shit!

46:11.480 --> 46:13.600
Yeah!

46:16.040 --> 46:18.380
Please don't do that.

46:21.160 --> 46:24.100
I told you to stop! Leave.

46:24.200 --> 46:27.120
Stop. Leave.

46:28.120 --> 46:30.340
Don't you hear me?

46:30.440 --> 46:32.380
Can't you hear my voice?

46:32.480 --> 46:35.340
This is my home.
My property.

46:35.440 --> 46:38.060
Those are my things.

46:38.160 --> 46:40.180
Crazy bitch!

46:40.280 --> 46:42.340
What did you call me?

46:42.440 --> 46:45.680
Whoever taught you to talk to
a woman like that?

46:53.880 --> 46:55.880
Psycho. Let's go.
