00:55.850 --> 00:58.957
<i> Hey, it's guy Carter.</i>

00:58.959 --> 01:02.294
<i>I just...</i>
<i>I just wanted to touch base</i>

01:04.030 --> 01:06.331
and let you know
that it was...

01:06.333 --> 01:08.967
It was amazing
meeting you last week.

01:08.969 --> 01:13.405
I felt really good
about it and umm...

01:13.407 --> 01:16.175
I hope you did too.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.976
So...

01:17.978 --> 01:21.380
I look forward
to talking to you soon.

01:21.382 --> 01:24.516
Okay, bye.

01:31.992 --> 01:35.260
Hey there,
it's guy Carter again.

01:35.262 --> 01:37.663
Just wondering
if there's any news.

01:37.665 --> 01:41.033
You said I'd hear by Monday
at the latest and...

01:41.035 --> 01:43.168
It's now Friday.

01:43.170 --> 01:46.171
I don't mean
to keep bugging you,

01:46.173 --> 01:49.741
but you basically said
i had the job.

01:49.743 --> 01:53.479
Hey, hi, I just...
I was thinking,

01:53.481 --> 01:57.249
if it's easier for you
to text or to e-mail,

01:57.251 --> 01:59.151
that's totally cool.

01:59.153 --> 02:02.988
Hey, it's guy Carter.
It's guy Carter, again.

02:02.990 --> 02:04.990
Oh, it's guy Carter.

02:04.992 --> 02:07.793
I don't want you to lose out
on getting me.

02:07.795 --> 02:11.630
I'm still at the same number.

02:11.632 --> 02:14.967
<i>Recording has been paused</i>
<i>due to silence.</i>

02:14.969 --> 02:17.202
Guy:
<i> Okay, now I'm pissed.</i>

02:17.204 --> 02:19.838
<i> How do you not call</i>
<i> someone back</i>

02:19.840 --> 02:21.073
who interviewed
three times

02:21.075 --> 02:23.208
and who you said
was a shoe-in?

02:23.210 --> 02:25.177
How do you not
hire someone

02:25.179 --> 02:27.179
who you said
had the best book
you'd ever seen?

02:27.181 --> 02:28.814
I deserve this job.

02:28.816 --> 02:33.652
I can only assume
the reason you're not
calling me back

02:33.654 --> 02:35.888
is because you're
too busy...

02:35.890 --> 02:38.223
Chomping on huge dicks.

02:38.225 --> 02:41.326
It's just a big dick
breakfast over there.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.962
Dick omelets
and dick pancakes.

02:43.964 --> 02:45.697
Scrambled dick.
Dick Benedict.

02:45.699 --> 02:49.001
All you can eat dick.
Would you like another mimosa
with your dick?

02:49.003 --> 02:50.235
There's a dick
carving station.

02:50.237 --> 02:52.704
You're just grabbing
as much dick.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.907
Oh no, that's okay,
I'm fine with my dick.

02:54.909 --> 02:57.242
Your plate is filled
with dick

02:57.244 --> 02:59.545
and then your mouth
is filled.

03:01.448 --> 03:03.515
In fact, it's
so full of dick,

03:03.517 --> 03:06.952
that I can't pick up the phone
and make a simple--

03:06.954 --> 03:09.154
man on the phone:
<i> Guy. Rob veckmann.</i>

03:09.156 --> 03:10.856
<i>The reason</i>
<i>I didn't call you</i>

03:10.858 --> 03:13.358
<i> is because my wife's been</i>
<i> plowing my business partner.</i>

03:13.360 --> 03:16.562
<i> They took over the company</i>
<i> and fired me.</i>

03:16.564 --> 03:18.463
Oh, man.

03:18.465 --> 03:23.202
Oh, that's...
Wow! I had no idea.

03:23.204 --> 03:27.539
Rob: <i> Yeah, there's a lot</i>
<i> you don't know. Dick.</i>

03:27.541 --> 03:30.842
Rob? Rob?

03:45.124 --> 03:47.659
Anne: You alright
in here, chief?

03:48.995 --> 03:50.996
How long have you been
standing there?

03:50.998 --> 03:53.365
Long enough to hear
the dick buffet.

03:55.702 --> 03:58.003
Guy...

03:58.005 --> 03:59.838
You're making
yourself crazy.

04:04.344 --> 04:06.878
How's the crib
coming along?

04:08.314 --> 04:11.283
It's getting there.

04:11.285 --> 04:13.318
You know, not assembling
that thing

04:13.320 --> 04:16.255
isn't gonna stop her
from coming out of me.

04:16.257 --> 04:18.624
Why would I want
to stop her?

04:18.625 --> 04:22.928
Although, I mean,
i guess I wouldn't be
totally upset

04:22.930 --> 04:25.330
if she held off
another eight months.

04:25.332 --> 04:28.300
That's funny. I was thinking
if she came sooner,

04:28.302 --> 04:30.535
like say, before Tuesday,

04:30.537 --> 04:33.038
we'd still have
health insurance
to cover it.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.543
What is that supposed
to mean?

04:38.545 --> 04:40.112
Umm...

04:40.114 --> 04:42.514
Well, pretty much
what it sounds like.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.616
Wait? Are you--
you're serious.

04:44.618 --> 04:47.552
Anne? How are you just
telling me this now?

04:47.554 --> 04:49.354
I don't... you were
so stressed out

04:49.356 --> 04:51.456
I didn't wanna
make it worse.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.992
It looked like
the resource thing
was happening,

04:53.994 --> 04:55.427
so I didn't mention it.

04:55.429 --> 04:58.363
But now,
I'm mentioning it.

04:58.365 --> 05:02.134
They have to give you
some sort of grace period,
right?

05:02.136 --> 05:05.003
They did.
It ends Tuesday.

05:07.840 --> 05:10.309
I mean, I assumed you'd
be working by now.

05:10.311 --> 05:13.445
Yeah. Well, we dropped
the ball on that one.

05:13.447 --> 05:16.214
I'm sorry, "we"?
Meaning me?

05:16.216 --> 05:17.749
You quit your job.

05:17.751 --> 05:20.419
Because we got pregnant.

05:23.189 --> 05:25.357
I can't talk about this
right now.

05:25.359 --> 05:27.693
I'm gonna make tea.

05:29.495 --> 05:31.029
Anne...

06:14.575 --> 06:17.609
Anne: Here.

06:17.611 --> 06:18.610
What is this?

06:18.612 --> 06:20.312
Anne: I found it
on craigslist.

06:20.314 --> 06:22.681
It's the only thing
remotely realistic.

06:22.683 --> 06:24.149
Now if you studied
dental hygiene,

06:24.151 --> 06:27.452
that would really open up
our options.

06:32.191 --> 06:34.025
You want me to be
a delivery guy?

06:34.027 --> 06:37.396
I want you to be
anything if it pays
the insurance by Tuesday.

06:37.398 --> 06:39.598
That will buy us
another month,

06:39.600 --> 06:41.266
unless of course
you want me to call
my parents

06:41.268 --> 06:42.934
and ask for more money
again.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.369
It is an option.

06:44.371 --> 06:47.472
No. No, it is not
an option, Anne.

06:47.474 --> 06:49.374
I don't wanna go into labor
and find out the "repo man"

06:49.376 --> 06:50.742
towed my car
out of the driveway.

06:50.744 --> 06:53.078
There's no such thing
as the "repo man."

06:53.080 --> 06:54.679
Of course there is.

06:54.681 --> 06:56.715
Have you ever seen
a repo man...

06:56.717 --> 06:58.717
Not counting
the Emilio estevez
movie?

06:58.719 --> 07:03.155
Guy, I'm not gonna argue
the existence of repo men

07:03.157 --> 07:04.289
because they're real.

07:04.291 --> 07:06.258
What do they come with,
a tow truck

07:06.260 --> 07:08.059
or a fleet of unicorns?

07:08.061 --> 07:09.528
My half-brother's mom Sandy,

07:09.530 --> 07:11.396
said that she had
her car taken

07:11.398 --> 07:13.365
and I believe it was
by a repo man, okay?

07:13.367 --> 07:17.335
What? They are not...
I might throw up on you.

07:17.337 --> 07:18.870
Guy: You're not gonna
throw up on me.

07:18.872 --> 07:20.505
A little bit.

07:20.507 --> 07:24.843
Why don't you go lie down
and I'll bring you something?
Okay?

07:24.845 --> 07:29.014
Go! Go lay down,
I'll bring you something.

07:31.217 --> 07:33.084
Anne: They're real.

07:37.256 --> 07:39.858
Guy: Here you go.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.960
For your tummy.

07:52.138 --> 07:55.307
Sorry for being
such a baby.

07:55.309 --> 07:57.742
I know you're frustrated.

08:00.948 --> 08:02.614
It's just so stupid.

08:02.616 --> 08:05.450
I'm supposed to have
my ducks in a row by now.

08:05.452 --> 08:08.887
Maybe it's okay to not
have your ducks in a row.

08:08.889 --> 08:11.957
It's not okay.
Ducks have to be
in a row.

08:11.959 --> 08:16.695
Have you ever seen ducks?
They're sorta crazy.

08:16.697 --> 08:21.633
They like to run around,
do shit.

08:21.635 --> 08:25.604
No, I don't...
Not my ducks.

08:25.606 --> 08:28.607
My ducks are different
than your ducks.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.475
Mine are not running
around and crazy.

08:30.477 --> 08:32.744
They have an objective,
they have a plan.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.578
They wanna get
somewhere in life.

08:34.581 --> 08:37.082
Then they're like
walking in a line,

08:37.083 --> 08:39.384
otherwise known
as a row.

08:39.385 --> 08:41.352
Honey, oww.

08:41.355 --> 08:43.421
Then call the number.

08:53.834 --> 08:54.833
Man:
<i> Word up?</i>

08:54.835 --> 08:56.501
Oh. Hey. Um...

08:56.503 --> 08:59.271
I'm calling
about your ad.

08:59.273 --> 09:00.672
Man:
<i> You got a car?</i>

09:00.674 --> 09:03.708
Guy: Yes.
Man: <i> Does it run?</i>

09:03.710 --> 09:06.978
Yes.
Man: <i> Meet me at fat burger</i>
<i>in west Hollywood.</i>

09:06.980 --> 09:09.548
Umm... okay.

09:09.550 --> 09:11.550
Oh, a question...

09:11.552 --> 09:13.285
This may be
a little premature,

09:13.287 --> 09:15.487
but are there benefits?

09:15.489 --> 09:17.789
Man: <i> Plenty.</i>

09:17.791 --> 09:22.193
<i> P, l, e, n, t, y,</i>
<i> my man.</i>

09:58.431 --> 10:01.099
<i>My bad.</i>

10:04.670 --> 10:07.806
<i> Yeah. Um-hm.</i>
<i> What he do?</i>

10:12.378 --> 10:16.381
Scraping the guardrail
doesn't necessarily mean
he was wasted.

10:16.383 --> 10:19.718
Oh.
You got me there.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.754
Okay, yeah, no.
I'll tell him,

10:22.756 --> 10:25.790
"no more shootin' up
in the car."

10:25.792 --> 10:29.694
But, fret not, I got a buddy
that will drive you.

10:29.696 --> 10:33.431
Um-hm.
About six foot.

10:33.433 --> 10:36.534
Serious, clean.
Like a cop.

10:36.536 --> 10:39.938
No, he's not a real cop.

10:39.940 --> 10:42.574
I can promise you
he will not hit on you.

10:42.576 --> 10:46.645
How do I know?
'Cause he's gay.

10:48.414 --> 10:50.015
Gay as fuck.

10:50.017 --> 10:52.050
Real gay.

10:52.052 --> 10:54.386
No, he got a sweet ride.

10:54.388 --> 10:56.488
A Volvo.

10:56.490 --> 10:58.256
Yeah, yeah.

10:58.258 --> 11:01.292
Don't get pissy with me.
I'm trying to hook you up.

11:01.294 --> 11:03.461
Sit.

11:03.463 --> 11:05.463
Okay, bye.

11:05.465 --> 11:07.832
You o negative?

11:07.834 --> 11:09.300
No, I'm...

11:09.302 --> 11:12.370
I'm not talking to you.
Uh-huh.

11:12.372 --> 11:14.072
Right.
Are you o negative?

11:14.074 --> 11:16.908
No, I'm--
I'm not talkin' to you.
Hold up.

11:16.910 --> 11:20.078
All right,
i love you too. Bye.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.479
You the one just called?

11:21.481 --> 11:24.315
Yeah, I'm guy.

11:26.118 --> 11:29.087
I'm zoley. Congratulations.
You're hired.

11:30.690 --> 11:35.026
Okay... well,
what am I gonna be driving?

11:35.795 --> 11:38.063
Pizzas?
Dry cleaning? What?

11:38.065 --> 11:42.267
Girls. The first one's
named Nikki.

11:42.269 --> 11:43.435
Huh.

11:44.870 --> 11:47.539
You didn't mention that
in your ad.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.607
It's all above board,
man.

11:49.609 --> 11:51.376
You're not doin'
anything illegal,

11:51.378 --> 11:52.377
you're just drivin'
a car.

11:52.379 --> 11:55.480
Pickin' up, droppin' off.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.482
Easy as cake.

11:59.518 --> 12:01.486
What are the benefits?

12:02.655 --> 12:04.389
Well, you play
your cards right,

12:04.391 --> 12:05.890
there can be
all kinds of benefits.

12:05.892 --> 12:09.194
Know what I'm sayin'?

12:13.132 --> 12:14.966
Guy, you about this life,
or what?

12:14.968 --> 12:19.170
No, no no no...
I'm... yes... I'm...

12:19.172 --> 12:20.638
I'm about this life.

12:20.640 --> 12:23.708
Okay, all right.
Mm-hmm. Okay, sweet.

12:23.710 --> 12:26.578
Here's where she's at.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.880
Oh, whoa. Now?
You want me to start now?

12:28.882 --> 12:32.317
Right now, yes.
Nikki is waitin'.

12:32.319 --> 12:34.753
And Nikki do not
like to wait.

13:11.056 --> 13:13.691
Hi. I'm guy.

13:13.693 --> 13:16.594
Guy, with the sweet
ride, guy?

13:16.596 --> 13:19.597
That'd be me.

13:19.599 --> 13:22.600
Call me Nikki,
Nikki winters.

13:22.602 --> 13:24.969
And next time,
don't be late.

13:37.316 --> 13:40.385
So where are we going?

13:40.387 --> 13:42.320
Bel-air.

13:50.729 --> 13:54.165
Female voice on GPS:
<i> Please proceed</i>
<i> to the highlighted route.</i>

13:54.167 --> 13:56.234
Want music?

13:56.236 --> 13:58.570
Smooth jazz is good.

13:58.572 --> 14:00.872
Not what i
would've guessed.

14:00.874 --> 14:02.740
Nikki:
My life's hectic enough.

14:02.742 --> 14:04.709
I don't need
my music to be.

14:14.120 --> 14:16.321
You realize,
we're still late.

14:16.323 --> 14:19.858
Yeah... I got a ticket
going through a yellow.

14:19.860 --> 14:22.594
So now I just stop.

14:32.938 --> 14:36.040
So about this client,
I've been with him before.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.876
He's a doctor.
Pretty basic.

14:37.878 --> 14:39.177
Just walk me to the door,

14:39.179 --> 14:41.613
and let him know you'll be
outside in the car.

14:41.615 --> 14:44.983
I thought the job
was just dropping off
and picking up?

14:44.985 --> 14:46.718
"The job" is being
my driver.

14:46.720 --> 14:49.587
That's a ride
and protection.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.823
You carry a weapon?

14:51.825 --> 14:55.593
Me? A weapon?
No, I do not carry
a weapon.

14:55.595 --> 14:56.995
What about karate?
You know karate?

14:56.997 --> 15:00.164
I have zero skills
in the lethal arts.

15:00.166 --> 15:03.067
I'm an architect.
I know how to draw.

15:03.069 --> 15:06.304
Never mind, I got my own
protection right here.

15:07.907 --> 15:12.510
Great. I'll let you handle
that part of the operation.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.178
And what about you?

15:14.180 --> 15:18.082
How did you get
into this line
of work?

15:19.652 --> 15:22.153
Well, it's not exactly
an everyday job.

15:22.155 --> 15:24.822
Well, that depends where
you spend every day.

15:24.824 --> 15:26.157
I grew up
in the valley.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.859
Every girl I know
did a porno

15:27.861 --> 15:28.960
by the time
she was eighteen.

15:28.962 --> 15:30.695
Or at least
a stripping gig.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.263
But you're still doing it.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.998
Nikki: Yeah,
'cause I'm good at it.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.867
I don't get
what the big deal is.

15:35.869 --> 15:39.337
Nobody asks a carpenter
why they became a carpenter.

15:41.707 --> 15:43.308
Fair enough.

16:23.949 --> 16:25.783
Hello, stranger.

16:25.785 --> 16:28.019
It's been too long.

16:28.021 --> 16:31.289
My driver.
Great house.

16:31.291 --> 16:32.457
Paul Williams?

16:32.459 --> 16:34.125
Paul Williams, right?

16:34.127 --> 16:37.362
He's a pioneer
of the California
regency movement.

16:37.364 --> 16:39.197
Really great designer.

16:39.199 --> 16:40.898
Designed a lot
in the fifties,

16:40.900 --> 16:42.367
which is when
it looks this house
is from.

16:42.369 --> 16:44.135
He's black, incidentally,
which doesn't really--

16:44.137 --> 16:47.405
I'm sorry.
Do I care about anything
you're saying right now?

16:47.407 --> 16:49.107
Nikki:
No, you don't.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.242
Don't you have
somewhere to go?

16:51.244 --> 16:52.777
Yes. He does.

16:52.779 --> 16:54.278
He'll be in the car.
Right, guy?

16:54.280 --> 16:57.849
Right, of course.
I'll be in the car.

16:57.851 --> 17:00.585
Nikki:
See you in an hour.

17:26.845 --> 17:29.113
Fuck this.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.426
Anne:
<i> Baby?</i>

17:41.428 --> 17:42.994
So guess what?

17:42.996 --> 17:44.662
<i> I'm not driving pizzas.</i>

17:44.664 --> 17:46.197
What are you driving?

17:46.199 --> 17:48.666
Guy: Hookers.
Anne: <i> Shut up.</i>

17:48.668 --> 17:50.201
I'm serious.

17:50.203 --> 17:52.670
<i> I picked up this lady</i>
<i> called Nikki winters.</i>

17:52.672 --> 17:55.239
You're fibbing me.
I fib you not.

17:55.241 --> 17:57.275
<i> You know that's not</i>
<i> her real name, right?</i>

17:57.277 --> 18:00.311
No way.
<i>Oh my, god. What was she like?</i>

18:00.313 --> 18:02.713
Was she hot?
Did she have an amazing body?

18:02.715 --> 18:05.316
<i> Did she look</i>
<i> like Julia Roberts</i>
<i> in "pretty woman"?</i>

18:05.318 --> 18:08.386
No. This was not
a happy hooker.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.054
This lady was mean.

18:10.056 --> 18:12.857
Mean?
Can you blame her?

18:12.859 --> 18:16.027
I guess not.
<i>So where is she now?</i>

18:16.029 --> 18:17.862
At some doctor's house.

18:17.864 --> 18:20.498
<i>And you're just like sitting</i>
<i>out in the driveway</i>
<i>or something?</i>

18:20.500 --> 18:22.100
No, I left.

18:22.102 --> 18:23.601
<i> What do you mean</i>
<i> you left?</i>

18:23.603 --> 18:25.937
You just ditched her?

18:25.939 --> 18:28.473
Babe, this guy,
he totally insulted me.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.308
I told him his house
was a Paul Williams,

18:30.310 --> 18:32.477
and he looked at me
like I was an idiot.

18:32.479 --> 18:35.213
<i> I mean, hello, I have</i>
<i> a master's in architecture</i>
<i> from Yale,</i>

18:35.215 --> 18:36.981
I think I know what
I'm talking about.

18:36.983 --> 18:39.917
<i> Guy, what if something</i>
<i> happens to her?</i>

18:39.919 --> 18:43.321
Like what?
<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>was he creepy?</i>

18:43.323 --> 18:46.557
He hired a hooker
to come to his mansion
in the daytime.

18:46.559 --> 18:47.825
Of course he was creepy.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.260
Plus, he's like a doctor.

18:49.262 --> 18:51.963
They're the worst
kind of psychos.

18:51.965 --> 18:54.465
He's her regular.
I'm sure it's fine.

18:54.467 --> 18:57.435
<i> You don't know that.</i>
<i> You have to go back.</i>

18:57.437 --> 19:00.838
Anne, you're crazy talking.
I'm almost home.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.541
<i>If something happens,</i>
<i>you'll never forgive</i>
<i>yourself!</i>

19:03.543 --> 19:08.746
<i> Go back now!</i>
<i> This is someone's daughter</i>
<i> we're talking about.</i>

19:21.860 --> 19:23.828
Oh! Sorry.

19:24.963 --> 19:27.231
Okay, I see you.

19:27.233 --> 19:29.901
I got... all right!
One sec.

19:29.903 --> 19:33.004
I just gotta u-turn.

19:33.006 --> 19:35.540
Man in car:
<i>Man, move it!</i>

19:35.542 --> 19:37.441
Man in car:
<i>Jesus!</i>

20:17.016 --> 20:18.749
Word up?

20:18.751 --> 20:20.952
<i> Hey, it's guy.</i>

20:20.954 --> 20:22.119
Yeah, you with Nikki?

20:22.121 --> 20:23.621
She's in a house
with a client.

20:23.623 --> 20:25.990
Said she'd be out
twenty minutes ago,

20:25.992 --> 20:26.991
<i> but she's not.</i>

20:26.993 --> 20:29.060
Nikki's never late.

20:29.062 --> 20:31.729
Hold on,
I'll try her cell.

20:35.934 --> 20:38.569
Zoley:
<i> She's not pickin' up.</i>

20:38.571 --> 20:41.038
Damn, that's all I need
is another Nikki problem.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.974
She's, like, fifty percent
of my business.

20:42.976 --> 20:44.542
I lose her, then I'm out
on the street.

20:44.544 --> 20:47.111
Spoken like a true pimp.
<i>Spoken like a true white boy.</i>

20:47.113 --> 20:48.913
There are no more pimps.

20:48.915 --> 20:51.182
Pimps got killed
by craigslist.

20:51.184 --> 20:52.717
I'm a dispatcher.

20:52.719 --> 20:55.086
<i> I work for Nikki,</i>
<i> not the other way around.</i>

20:55.088 --> 20:57.655
She needs a ride,
she calls me.

20:57.657 --> 21:00.258
If you screw this up,
then she's not gonna
call me.

21:00.260 --> 21:03.828
Okay, so what do I do?
Zoley: <i> Lemme think. Lemme think.</i>

21:03.830 --> 21:05.363
You got a gun?
Guy: What? No.

21:05.365 --> 21:07.365
Why does everyone keep
asking if I have a gun?

21:07.367 --> 21:10.635
Calm down, it's
an honest question.

21:10.637 --> 21:12.970
You know karate?
I am an architect!

21:12.972 --> 21:14.538
Zoley:
<i> Architects can</i>
<i> know karate.</i>

21:14.540 --> 21:16.941
Well, I don't!

21:16.943 --> 21:18.576
You gonna have
to go in, man.

21:18.578 --> 21:21.545
<i> Pretend you're not wearing</i>
<i> a pink shirt and go in!</i>

22:40.926 --> 22:42.593
Shit!

22:59.444 --> 23:02.480
Doctor:
<i> That's right.</i>

23:02.482 --> 23:05.649
<i> Go ahead,</i>
<i> struggle all you want.</i>

23:11.657 --> 23:13.324
<i> You're not</i>
<i> getting out of this.</i>

23:13.326 --> 23:15.559
<i> You're never</i>
<i> getting out of this.</i>

23:16.928 --> 23:20.998
<i> Helpless right now, huh?</i>
<i> Pretty vulnerable.</i>

23:21.000 --> 23:22.967
Ah, there we go.

23:24.803 --> 23:26.270
That's too tight.

23:26.272 --> 23:28.539
Nikki:
Hmm-mm.

23:30.308 --> 23:32.076
Hmm-mm.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.778
Huh?

23:37.984 --> 23:40.050
Guy:
Oh shit! Oh, oh!

23:40.052 --> 23:41.652
Shit, shit,
shit, shit.

23:41.654 --> 23:43.320
Okay. Here we go.
Here we go.

23:43.322 --> 23:44.622
I'm here. I'm here.
I'm sorry.

23:44.624 --> 23:47.191
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

23:47.193 --> 23:49.627
What do you mean?
He was torturing you.

23:49.629 --> 23:52.263
That was role play,
you dumbass.
What?

23:52.265 --> 23:55.366
I was teaching him
how to tie bondage knots.

23:55.368 --> 23:58.469
He pays extra
if I let him wear
the dog mask.

23:58.471 --> 24:01.839
Or at least, he was gonna.
Just untie me, okay?

24:01.841 --> 24:03.474
Uh... Jesus. How?

24:03.476 --> 24:05.509
How do you...
Oh, my god!

24:05.511 --> 24:07.411
Is this guy a fucking
eagle scout?

24:07.413 --> 24:09.580
Hold on. I took
sailing camp one summer

24:09.582 --> 24:11.682
and I think this is a...
What do you call this knot?

24:11.684 --> 24:13.417
Are you fucking
kidding me?
Sorry.

24:13.419 --> 24:14.685
Let me, okay, hold on.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.720
It's like
a spaghetti factory.

24:16.722 --> 24:18.189
I don't even know
where to begin.

24:18.191 --> 24:20.124
Under.
Under what?

24:20.126 --> 24:21.792
Under, over.
Under.

24:21.794 --> 24:23.327
Under, over, yeah.

24:23.329 --> 24:24.595
Pretty simple.
Yeah.

24:24.597 --> 24:26.263
I think I got it,
i think I got it!

24:26.265 --> 24:27.665
Got it, got it,
got it, got it,
got it.

24:27.667 --> 24:29.233
Got it.
Is that good?
Is that good?

24:29.235 --> 24:31.902
Okay. Phew!
Yes!

24:34.105 --> 24:36.674
Yeah, that's it.
I knew it!

24:36.676 --> 24:37.875
I knew it.

24:37.877 --> 24:40.144
Idiot!
Oww!

24:40.146 --> 24:41.345
Guy: Shit!

24:41.347 --> 24:44.014
Nikki:
<i>Here, put this in a case.</i>

24:46.017 --> 24:49.954
Jesus! What the hell
is wrong with you people?

24:51.990 --> 24:54.558
Does this go
a certain way?

24:54.560 --> 24:57.228
Now look, I still
gotta get paid,

24:57.230 --> 24:59.330
but I'm gonna give you
half price.

25:00.933 --> 25:03.334
Oh, and good work today.

25:03.336 --> 25:05.035
Oww! Fuck!

25:05.037 --> 25:07.805
Guy, come on.
Sorry. Yeah.

25:08.573 --> 25:11.742
Got it.
Got it. Got it.

25:11.744 --> 25:14.245
Nikki: <i> Guy, come on!</i>
Fucking got it!

25:14.247 --> 25:15.546
Son of a...

25:15.548 --> 25:18.883
Nikki: I can't fucking
believe this.

25:41.506 --> 25:43.307
You think this
was my fault?

25:43.309 --> 25:46.510
Whose fault was it?
You said an hour!

25:46.512 --> 25:48.379
Yeah, well, he was stuck
on the bachmann hitch.

25:48.381 --> 25:49.847
That's a really hard knot.

25:49.849 --> 25:51.448
The rabbit has to go
around the tree three times

25:51.450 --> 25:53.083
before he goes
down the hole.

25:53.085 --> 25:55.119
You know what,
if I'm gonna be late,
i usually text

25:55.121 --> 25:57.454
but you said you were
sticking to the driving

25:57.456 --> 25:58.856
and I was handling
the protection,

25:58.858 --> 26:00.457
which there was
no need for,

26:00.459 --> 26:02.192
until you decided
there was.

26:02.194 --> 26:05.029
I cannot believe
that this is my life
right now.

26:05.031 --> 26:09.633
We committed a crime, Nikki.
An actual crime.

26:09.635 --> 26:11.902
I broke and entered.
I assaulted.

26:11.904 --> 26:15.806
What if he's dead?
What if I just murdered
a doctor?

26:15.808 --> 26:19.076
Don't flatter yourself.
It's a bump on the head
at best.

26:19.078 --> 26:20.778
What if he calls
the cops?

26:20.780 --> 26:23.747
Trust me, the doc
is not gonna tell anyone
about this.

26:23.749 --> 26:25.683
Besides him,
I'm the only one
that knows

26:25.685 --> 26:28.085
about your retarded
heroics.

26:28.087 --> 26:29.420
Suffice to say,

26:29.422 --> 26:30.821
I'm not payin'
your percentage
on that stop.

26:30.823 --> 26:33.924
My percentage?
You get 20% of the take.

26:33.926 --> 26:33.924
What "take"?

26:33.926 --> 26:37.361
Everything we make,
you get 20% of.

26:37.363 --> 26:39.196
How do you
not know this?

26:39.198 --> 26:40.798
I don't know,
i guess...

26:40.800 --> 26:41.865
Everything happened
so fast,

26:41.867 --> 26:43.667
I forgot to ask
about the money.

26:43.669 --> 26:46.937
Never forget
to ask about the money.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.606
How much, exactly,
are we talking about?

26:48.608 --> 26:51.775
Saturday night,
a couple of stops...

26:51.777 --> 26:53.377
Plus the two girls
we're picking up

26:53.379 --> 26:54.945
for the bachelor party...

26:54.947 --> 26:58.616
All in, you could walk away
with a grand, maybe two.

26:58.618 --> 27:00.985
Two...
Two thousand...
Dollars?

27:00.987 --> 27:00.985
$2,000?

27:00.987 --> 27:04.521
Just to be clear,
I'm not doin' you
any favors.

27:04.523 --> 27:06.690
You're gonna earn it.

27:33.218 --> 27:34.652
Nikki:
Grab my bag.

27:37.022 --> 27:37.021
Ladies, shake a leg.

27:37.023 --> 27:40.391
Hey, make yourself at home,
why don't you?

27:40.393 --> 27:42.192
I always do.
Where's jaxi?

27:42.194 --> 27:44.328
Gettin' dolled up.

27:44.330 --> 27:45.462
Who's he?

27:45.464 --> 27:48.632
Hi, I'm guy.
I'm new.

27:48.634 --> 27:51.301
Nick, what the eff?

27:55.840 --> 27:58.042
Most people do that
in the shower.

27:58.044 --> 27:59.810
I'm not most people.

27:59.812 --> 28:01.879
This is a huge night.
We can't be breaking in
a new dude.

28:01.881 --> 28:05.449
Zip it, okay?
He's got a sweet ride.
A Volvo.

28:08.153 --> 28:09.987
This him?
Nikki: Uh-huh.

28:09.989 --> 28:12.656
Hi. I'm guy.

28:12.658 --> 28:14.058
He don't look like
no driver.

28:14.060 --> 28:16.560
Look, we have a party
in the penthouse at the teal.

28:16.562 --> 28:17.761
We need a guy
who's on point.

28:17.763 --> 28:20.064
He's up for it, okay?

28:20.066 --> 28:24.368
To prove it,
he's gonna wash
the hardware.

28:26.539 --> 28:29.773
Nikki: <i> Right, guy?</i>
Jaxi: Oh shit!

28:29.775 --> 28:32.076
That'll be fun.
They've been cooking.

28:32.078 --> 28:34.645
Guy: Is it-- oh!
Jaxi: Scrub-a-dub-dub.

28:34.647 --> 28:36.980
Fallon:
<i> It's leaking.</i>

28:36.982 --> 28:40.250
Fallon: <i> Yeah.</i>
Guy: You're kidding, right?

28:40.252 --> 28:43.253
The den mother don't kid.
Fallon: <i> No. Go, go!</i>

28:43.255 --> 28:44.655
Get it done, son.
Okay.

28:44.657 --> 28:46.290
Chop, chop.

28:46.292 --> 28:48.325
Mine's the purple one.
Have fun.

28:48.327 --> 28:50.694
It's dirty.

28:52.231 --> 28:55.265
Oh! Eww!

28:57.036 --> 28:58.802
Oh god!

29:40.045 --> 29:41.745
Eww. What the...

29:50.156 --> 29:52.089
Guy: <i> Hon.</i>
Baby, why you call me?

29:52.091 --> 29:53.991
What happened
with the lady
and the doctor?

29:53.993 --> 29:55.893
Guy:
<i> No, she's...</i>
<i> She's fine.</i>

29:55.895 --> 30:00.364
I picked her up
and now we're at this house
in the valley

30:00.366 --> 30:01.899
<i> with two other girls--</i>

30:01.901 --> 30:04.268
wait.
Two other hookers?

30:04.270 --> 30:06.170
Looks that way, yeah.

30:06.172 --> 30:09.206
Anne: <i> So you're</i>
<i> with three hookers now?</i>

30:09.208 --> 30:10.774
Yes.
<i> Uh-huh.</i>

30:10.776 --> 30:14.511
It's just you,
and three hookers,

30:14.513 --> 30:16.480
<i> at a house in the valley?</i>

30:16.482 --> 30:20.017
Uh... yeah,
but I'm about to drive them

30:20.019 --> 30:22.986
to a party,
where there'll be
a bunch of guys.

30:22.988 --> 30:26.857
Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

30:26.859 --> 30:28.358
Guy: <i> What do you want</i>
<i> me to say?</i>

30:28.360 --> 30:29.893
<i> I mean, you're the reason</i>
<i> I'm here at all.</i>

30:29.895 --> 30:31.929
<i> Remember,</i>
<i> "somebody's daughter?"</i>

30:31.931 --> 30:33.463
Yeah, well it seems
like everyone's

30:33.465 --> 30:34.998
safe and sound now.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.900
A few hours ago,
you wanted me to do
anything

30:36.902 --> 30:38.235
to keep our insurance!

30:38.237 --> 30:39.903
<i> Yeah, well baby,</i>
<i> a few hours ago,</i>

30:39.905 --> 30:41.705
<i> there weren't half a dozen</i>
<i> silicone tits</i>

30:41.707 --> 30:43.473
<i> staring you in the face.</i>

30:43.475 --> 30:47.211
Yeah, that's not quite
what's staring me in the face
right now.

30:47.213 --> 30:49.112
You still alive in there?

30:49.114 --> 30:50.747
Nikki: <i> Hey, you're just</i>
<i>supposed to be washing those.</i>

30:50.749 --> 30:52.115
<i> Don't give yourself cpr.</i>

30:52.117 --> 30:53.417
<i> We're gonna be tardy</i>
<i> to the party.</i>

30:53.419 --> 30:55.352
Guy:
<i> Okay. All right.</i>

30:55.354 --> 30:57.354
Babe. I have to go,
okay?

30:57.356 --> 31:00.557
I gotta clean
the hardware.

31:00.559 --> 31:01.625
<i> I'll talk to you</i>
<i> in a little bit.</i>

31:01.627 --> 31:03.460
<i> I love you, okay? Bye.</i>

31:11.135 --> 31:12.870
Hardware?

31:12.872 --> 31:16.206
Okay.
Good to go.

31:16.208 --> 31:17.808
You missed a spot.

31:17.810 --> 31:20.777
What, I scrubbed
with antibacterial.

31:20.779 --> 31:24.081
On your face.

31:24.083 --> 31:25.716
Oh, god.

31:25.718 --> 31:29.219
Ugh, get it off.
Is there...? Can I...?

31:29.221 --> 31:33.223
Come here.
Don't be such a wuss.
It's just lube.

31:33.225 --> 31:34.324
Eww.

31:34.326 --> 31:35.792
Okay, let's go.

31:35.794 --> 31:38.028
Fallon:
Bye, Nicky Hilton.

31:38.030 --> 31:41.198
Jaxi: I call shotgun.
Fallon: No, bitch,
i got shotgun.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.200
Bye, Nicky Hilton.

32:24.743 --> 32:26.944
Fallon: Woohoo!

32:26.946 --> 32:28.045
Breath mints, anyone?

32:28.047 --> 32:30.514
Jaxi: Nuh-uh,
put that shit away.

32:30.516 --> 32:31.782
What is your problem?

32:31.784 --> 32:32.883
I'm not doin'
another party

32:32.885 --> 32:34.551
with you about to be
poppin' those.

32:34.553 --> 32:36.119
And why the hell not?

32:36.121 --> 32:38.455
Last time you ate my pussy,
you had one in your mouth,

32:38.457 --> 32:40.590
I was numb for a week.

32:40.592 --> 32:42.059
Numb, but minty fresh.

32:42.061 --> 32:44.361
Bitch.
I am always minty fresh.
I'd like you fucking--

32:44.363 --> 32:47.698
hey, our driver
doesn't want to hear
your gory details.

32:47.700 --> 32:49.766
Oh, no,
don't mind me.

32:49.768 --> 32:52.069
Fallon:
We won't.

32:55.406 --> 32:58.075
Uh, that's...

32:58.077 --> 33:00.577
That's an open container
right there.

33:00.579 --> 33:02.079
Yeah, sure is.

33:02.081 --> 33:04.681
How else do you
get the liquid out, huh?

33:04.683 --> 33:06.350
Yeah, well...

33:06.352 --> 33:08.552
I don't really think
that's a good idea

33:08.554 --> 33:09.820
to have in the car.

33:09.822 --> 33:13.123
Right?
I mean, lots of cops.

33:13.125 --> 33:15.325
What's with this guy?

33:15.327 --> 33:17.995
Tell me he's not for real?
Please tell me.

33:17.997 --> 33:19.629
I'm sorry, but...

33:19.631 --> 33:22.733
Do you want us
to buckle our seat belts
back here too, grandpa?

33:22.735 --> 33:23.834
'Cause we can.

33:23.836 --> 33:25.802
You know what?
Go easy on him.

33:25.804 --> 33:29.740
He's sensitive...
I mean, being a gay
and all.

33:29.742 --> 33:31.708
Oh, you like boys?

33:31.710 --> 33:34.144
Oh my god,
that's so cute!

33:34.146 --> 33:35.979
We never had
a homo driver before.

33:35.981 --> 33:39.750
No wonder he took so long
washing the dildos.

33:39.752 --> 33:42.786
Ooh, ain't she
got your number!

33:44.423 --> 33:47.391
Nikki: We're open-minded.
Jaxi: Yeah, always.

34:34.572 --> 34:37.074
Ah, yeah,
my brothers!

34:37.076 --> 34:40.744
Da ladies are
in da house!

34:42.681 --> 34:44.181
Yo, you the pimp?

34:44.183 --> 34:46.416
You don't gotta front, bro.
I know what's up.

34:46.418 --> 34:46.416
You got that gat?

34:46.418 --> 34:50.920
You're the third person
to ask me that tonight
and I...

34:50.922 --> 34:53.356
You know what,
you don't wanna know,
actually.

34:53.358 --> 34:55.891
Man:
Oh, I bet he knows karate.

34:55.893 --> 34:57.928
What's up, bro?
I'm Dan, the best man.

34:57.930 --> 34:59.262
Hey, best man Dan.

34:59.264 --> 35:00.664
I think we spoke
on the phone.

35:00.666 --> 35:02.799
All the stuff in the rider,
is in the room,

35:02.801 --> 35:04.968
including the tabasco.

35:04.970 --> 35:06.970
Cool, let us get ready.

35:06.972 --> 35:08.738
Hey, boys.

35:08.740 --> 35:10.774
Look, I need these guys
to have the night
of their lives,

35:10.776 --> 35:13.443
I mean, I went all out
and got them custom hats
and everything.

35:13.445 --> 35:17.514
Umm... in terms of extras
after the show,

35:17.516 --> 35:19.749
how does that work?

35:19.751 --> 35:21.451
Uh...

35:21.453 --> 35:24.821
Look-- you know what?
We can discuss that I'm sure.

35:24.823 --> 35:26.923
Awesome, dude.
Awesome.

35:26.925 --> 35:28.792
Just say the word.
Okay.

35:32.798 --> 35:34.998
Everyone take
your dicks out.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.134
Whoa! Guy?

35:37.136 --> 35:40.737
Guy fucking Carter!
In the flesh.

35:40.739 --> 35:44.407
Yah!
What the fuck?

35:44.409 --> 35:46.176
Devon.
Yeah, man.

35:46.178 --> 35:48.812
How long has it been,
hustler?

35:48.814 --> 35:52.082
Uh...
I guess grad school.

35:52.084 --> 35:55.685
Wow! That is like
a lifetime ago.

35:55.687 --> 35:58.655
You heard I made partner

35:58.657 --> 36:00.790
at pivot point?

36:00.792 --> 36:03.326
No, wow.
You made partner.

36:03.328 --> 36:06.830
Wow, that's...
Congratulations.
That's amazing.

36:06.832 --> 36:08.565
It's rad.

36:08.567 --> 36:12.035
Me, of all people,
designing cell phones.

36:12.037 --> 36:14.504
Here's the secret.
Just keep makin' 'em thinner.

36:14.506 --> 36:17.641
They'll keep makin'
my pockets fatter.

36:17.643 --> 36:19.109
What about you, man?

36:19.111 --> 36:21.278
How's it shakin'
with old guy Carter?

36:21.280 --> 36:24.814
Oh... you know,
it's good.

36:24.816 --> 36:29.619
Yeah, man.
It's good. I'm solid.

36:31.722 --> 36:33.523
Jaxi: Hey, driver.
Fallon: Hey.

36:33.525 --> 36:37.027
Nikki: Guy, get in here.
Pour yourself a drink.

36:37.029 --> 36:38.562
Sucks when the civilians
spot you.

36:38.564 --> 36:40.530
Jaxi:
That never used to happen.

36:40.532 --> 36:42.399
Now it's like I can't even
go to a grocery store

36:42.401 --> 36:44.267
without some Jack-hole
being like,

36:44.269 --> 36:45.535
"weren't you
in such and such?"

36:45.537 --> 36:48.004
Used to be if you took
a really nasty job--

36:48.006 --> 36:49.739
like when you did
<i>black cock down?</i>

36:49.741 --> 36:53.109
Fallon: And you did
<i>weapons of ass destruction?</i>

36:53.111 --> 36:54.778
You know, the only way
someone would see it

36:54.780 --> 36:57.080
was if they went
to an equally nasty
video store,

36:57.082 --> 36:58.515
paid actual money,

36:58.517 --> 37:00.283
<i>watched it in a vcr,</i>
<i>returned it</i>

37:00.285 --> 37:01.551
<i>and never gave it</i>
<i>another thought.</i>

37:01.553 --> 37:03.453
Not only is everything
fucking free now,

37:03.455 --> 37:06.156
they watch it over
and over and over.

37:06.158 --> 37:08.091
You guys done
with the grass-is-greener
shit?

37:08.093 --> 37:09.759
We gotta bring guy
up to speed.

37:09.761 --> 37:12.062
You ready
for your fifteen minutes,
big daddy?

37:12.064 --> 37:15.398
Uh...
I'm not sure I follow.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.901
They think
you're a pimp, right?

37:17.903 --> 37:21.438
I thought there
were no more pimps
because of craigslist?

37:21.440 --> 37:24.774
There aren't.
But those fools out there
don't know that.

37:24.776 --> 37:25.976
So run with it.

37:25.978 --> 37:27.410
Act like
you're Willie dynamite,

37:27.412 --> 37:28.945
been beating chicks
down for years.

37:28.947 --> 37:31.448
That way they feel sorry
for us and they tip harder.

37:31.450 --> 37:33.883
How many ones
you got?

37:33.885 --> 37:35.352
A hundred.

37:35.354 --> 37:36.886
Here's what
we're gonna do.

37:36.888 --> 37:38.955
Sell 'em,
collect 'em again,
sell 'em again.

37:38.957 --> 37:40.957
If they're not sticky
by night's end,

37:40.959 --> 37:42.759
you didn't turn
'em around enough.

37:42.761 --> 37:45.228
And collect the panties,
'cause they'll steal 'em
and that shit's costly.

37:45.230 --> 37:49.532
Amen.
The most important thing,
learn your script.

37:51.035 --> 37:52.669
What, I have
to read this?

37:52.671 --> 37:55.772
Nikki: <i> You have to perform it.</i>
<i>You're a pimp, remember?</i>

37:55.774 --> 37:58.742
You gotta bring out
that big boss, Mac daddy,

37:58.744 --> 38:00.844
fur-coat-wearin'
motherfucker

38:00.846 --> 38:02.379
that I know is in you.

38:02.381 --> 38:03.880
Jaxi:
Bring it out, boo-boo.

38:03.882 --> 38:05.382
Okay, no.

38:05.384 --> 38:06.583
Fallon: What?
Jaxi: No?

38:06.585 --> 38:07.584
Guy: No, no, no, no,

38:07.586 --> 38:09.252
I...

38:09.254 --> 38:10.253
I can't do this.

38:10.255 --> 38:11.688
Fallon:
Are you kidding?

38:11.690 --> 38:13.456
I can't do this.

38:13.458 --> 38:16.993
There are people
out there that I...

38:16.995 --> 38:18.628
I'm sorry.

38:18.630 --> 38:21.998
I thought I was gonna
be delivering pizzas
tonight.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.533
Honestly.

38:23.535 --> 38:25.735
I'm in way over
my head here.

38:25.737 --> 38:28.071
I... I...

38:28.073 --> 38:31.775
This...

38:31.777 --> 38:34.044
I understand, guy.

38:34.046 --> 38:35.779
What?

38:37.048 --> 38:40.650
You do?
Yeah, 'cause it's...

38:40.652 --> 38:43.620
Thank you.
We get it.

38:43.622 --> 38:45.155
Thank you.

38:45.157 --> 38:48.358
Because this...
Is just not me.

38:48.360 --> 38:52.028
But, I'll pay for your cab,
it's only fair.

38:52.030 --> 38:53.596
Nikki:
We got it, guy.

38:53.598 --> 38:56.599
One thing, though.
You got a long drive.

38:56.601 --> 38:59.903
Might wanna visit
the little boys room,
first.

38:59.905 --> 39:02.572
Smart thinking.

39:02.574 --> 39:05.575
I do kind of have to go.
So, excuse me.

39:07.178 --> 39:09.679
Mm mm mm.

39:09.681 --> 39:13.216
Who said,
"don't break a guy
in on a Saturday night?"

39:13.218 --> 39:14.517
Who said it?

39:14.519 --> 39:16.953
Get your gear on
and shut your faces.

39:22.460 --> 39:25.795
Oh, sorry,
it's all yours.

39:26.864 --> 39:30.133
I'm not here
for the bathroom.

39:30.135 --> 39:34.137
So, you goin' home
to your boyfriend?

39:34.139 --> 39:35.505
Huh?

39:35.507 --> 39:37.607
You're still gay, right?

39:37.609 --> 39:41.911
Oh, yeah.
I'm gay. See?

39:41.913 --> 39:44.881
Pink shirt. I'm gay.

39:46.250 --> 39:47.817
So...

39:49.120 --> 39:53.022
You don't like it
when I do this?

39:53.024 --> 39:56.126
Um... not really.

39:57.461 --> 39:59.462
Or this...?

40:01.031 --> 40:02.732
No.

40:05.169 --> 40:07.837
Or this?

40:07.839 --> 40:09.038
Umm...

40:12.677 --> 40:15.445
Homos don't pop boners
when girls touch them.

40:15.447 --> 40:18.014
You know who does?
Husbands.

40:19.683 --> 40:22.185
Look, can I have
my phone, please?

40:22.187 --> 40:25.288
Is this
your "boyfriend"?

40:25.290 --> 40:28.158
That's Anne.
That is my wife.

40:28.160 --> 40:31.694
I wonder what Anne
would think of this?

40:31.696 --> 40:36.433
Let's see, contacts.
Anne Carter.

40:36.435 --> 40:38.168
"Attaching file"...

40:38.170 --> 40:40.270
Okay, Nikki...
Nikki...

40:40.272 --> 40:42.472
Please... please.

40:42.474 --> 40:45.008
She's 37 weeks pregnant.

40:45.010 --> 40:46.643
She's very
fragile right now.

40:46.645 --> 40:49.512
She will not understand this,
not in a million years.

40:49.514 --> 40:51.648
I'm sure she wouldn't.
I wouldn't.

40:51.650 --> 40:53.149
I mean, nobody likes
a cheater.

40:53.151 --> 40:56.920
Okay, please,
Anne will leave me.

40:56.922 --> 40:59.322
She will leave me,
okay?

40:59.324 --> 41:03.059
You don't understand
the stress we're under,

41:03.061 --> 41:04.227
both of us out of work.

41:04.229 --> 41:06.529
Oh, cry me a river,
Volvo guy.

41:06.531 --> 41:07.931
Yeah, things sound
really desperate,

41:07.933 --> 41:10.200
with you turning your back
on an easy grand.

41:10.202 --> 41:13.169
I... I told you,

41:13.171 --> 41:15.472
I can't do this job.

41:15.474 --> 41:18.374
It's too much for me.

41:18.376 --> 41:21.411
Everything's just...

41:21.413 --> 41:26.382
It's too much for me.

41:26.384 --> 41:28.785
I got two words
for you, mister:

41:28.787 --> 41:31.554
Buck the hell up.

41:31.556 --> 41:33.756
Now, I'm gonna
keep hold of this.

41:33.758 --> 41:35.458
And you're gonna
learn these...

41:35.460 --> 41:36.993
And get
your non-gay-ass

41:36.995 --> 41:39.295
into that room
and you're gonna
do your job.

41:39.297 --> 41:40.697
Okay?

41:50.641 --> 41:53.209
He was un-cool with it.
Now he's cool with it.

41:53.211 --> 41:56.546
Let's go, let's go.
Lets' go.

41:56.548 --> 42:00.183
Bring them out!
Bring them out!

42:00.185 --> 42:02.485
Bring them out!
Bring them out!

42:02.487 --> 42:05.822
Bring them out!

42:09.994 --> 42:11.194
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

42:11.196 --> 42:13.162
Guy: <i> All right. Shit.</i>

42:13.164 --> 42:14.330
Man: <i> That shirt is so pink.</i>

42:14.332 --> 42:17.066
Hi.

42:17.068 --> 42:19.869
Hello. Hi.
Okay, okay.

42:19.871 --> 42:22.338
Sit down.
Man: <i> Come on, get on with it.</i>

42:22.340 --> 42:24.507
You want me to bring
the ladies out...

42:24.509 --> 42:27.076
We gotta learn
a few basic rules.

42:28.780 --> 42:30.613
Bullshit!

42:32.850 --> 42:36.586
First and foremost,
no kissing the ladies
on the mouth.

42:36.588 --> 42:38.087
They don't like it.

42:40.725 --> 42:42.725
It's alright, it's...
Man: <i> Can I kiss you?</i>

42:42.727 --> 42:46.296
That's what it says.
Second rule...

42:46.298 --> 42:47.697
Man:
<i> Take off your top!</i>

42:47.699 --> 42:49.766
No fingers
in any holes.

42:52.704 --> 42:53.937
That's a deal breaker.

42:53.939 --> 42:57.740
That also goes
for remote controls.

42:57.742 --> 43:02.045
Cheese doodles.
Action figures.
Action figures?

43:02.047 --> 43:03.947
Man:
<i> Is my dick</i>
<i> an action figure?</i>

43:03.949 --> 43:08.284
Anything other
than a sanctioned toy
goes in the holes,

43:08.286 --> 43:09.285
show's over.

43:12.424 --> 43:14.591
One last thing.

43:14.593 --> 43:17.160
You want a hot show,
you're gonna have to tip.

43:17.162 --> 43:18.695
Man:
I'll show you my tip.

43:18.697 --> 43:22.332
I'll be selling
ones all night, all right?

43:22.334 --> 43:24.400
So, anyone?

43:28.239 --> 43:29.572
Man:
<i> Fuck yeah!</i>

43:29.574 --> 43:31.307
Guy: <i> Put your hands together</i>

43:31.309 --> 43:33.443
<i> for the owner</i>
<i> and founder</i>

43:33.445 --> 43:37.013
of "bad gurls"
party services,

43:37.015 --> 43:38.214
miss Nikki winters

43:38.216 --> 43:41.250
and her bffs
jaxi and fallon!

43:45.924 --> 43:47.657
Take it off!

43:49.994 --> 43:51.828
Yeah!

44:14.452 --> 44:17.920
Man: <i> Work that!</i>
<i> Shake it out right!</i>

44:47.551 --> 44:50.219
Good work, guy.
You get your phone back.

44:51.822 --> 44:53.356
Thanks.

44:54.525 --> 44:56.759
Jaxi:
You like that, daddy?

44:56.761 --> 45:01.030
There you go.
Um-hmm. Yeah.

45:01.032 --> 45:02.632
I'll take that.

45:02.634 --> 45:06.769
Hey, bullshit on that shit!

45:06.771 --> 45:09.505
Your chick just
lifted all my ones!

45:09.507 --> 45:12.542
That's fuckin'
unacceptable.

45:12.544 --> 45:13.776
That's how you run
your business, bro?

45:13.778 --> 45:15.478
No, no, no!
I'm sorry.

45:15.480 --> 45:17.013
I'll get your ones back.

45:17.015 --> 45:18.915
Watch and learn.

45:18.917 --> 45:21.050
Oh yeah! Oh!

45:40.604 --> 45:42.505
Jaxi:
Make it rain, baby!

45:42.507 --> 45:44.340
Hi, daddy!

45:47.512 --> 45:51.581
Jaxi:
<i> You like that?</i>
<i> Give me more.</i>

45:51.583 --> 45:53.382
Hello?
Jaxi: <i> I'll keep giving you more.</i>

45:53.384 --> 45:57.487
Anne. Hold on,
hold on.

46:03.393 --> 46:05.795
Hon. Everything okay?

46:08.465 --> 46:12.201
What? Wait. Now?

46:12.203 --> 46:15.772
That's impossible.
You're still three weeks away.

46:17.341 --> 46:21.210
This is what marriage
is gonna feel like.

46:24.081 --> 46:27.083
Holy Christ. Okay.
Well, uh...

46:27.085 --> 46:30.887
What should we do?
What do you want me to do?

46:34.191 --> 46:36.359
Okay, I'll be there.

46:41.499 --> 46:42.832
Ow! Hey, it really hurts.

46:42.834 --> 46:45.034
Nikki:
It's supposed to.

46:45.036 --> 46:47.703
Guy:
Nikki, Nikki, Nikki,
i gotta talk to you.

46:47.705 --> 46:49.138
I'm kinda in the middle
of something.

46:49.140 --> 46:52.608
Guy:
It's an emergency. Please?

46:52.610 --> 46:54.043
Nikki:
Go to town.

46:54.045 --> 46:56.712
Man:
<i> His ass is bleeding, dude!</i>

46:56.714 --> 46:58.714
It actually really hurts.

46:58.716 --> 47:00.650
Nikki:
What's the problem?

47:00.652 --> 47:02.118
I gotta go.

47:02.120 --> 47:03.820
Haven't we been through
this already tonight?

47:03.822 --> 47:06.589
This is different.
I'm having a family crisis.

47:06.591 --> 47:09.258
Yeah, well,
you leave, I'm having
a financial crisis, okay?

47:09.260 --> 47:11.294
Party games are up next.
You really wanna
miss all the fun?

47:11.296 --> 47:13.763
No, no, but--
yeah, we're gonna put licorice
up our pussies,

47:13.765 --> 47:14.964
and they're gonna
eat it out.

47:14.966 --> 47:16.499
Then we pour Tequila shots
in our pussies

47:16.501 --> 47:17.900
and they drink it out.

47:17.902 --> 47:19.635
Oh, then we put whipped cream
in our pussies

47:19.637 --> 47:21.037
and they lick--

47:21.039 --> 47:22.772
I get it, I get it.
Lots of stuff going into the...

47:22.774 --> 47:25.174
Fallon: <i> That's what we do.</i>
Guy: ...Pussies.

47:25.176 --> 47:26.843
Yeah, I need you here
to cut the deals,

47:26.845 --> 47:27.910
keep the supplies coming

47:27.912 --> 47:29.378
Tequila, candy,
whipped cream...

47:29.380 --> 47:32.548
Nikki,
my wife just called.

47:32.550 --> 47:34.650
She's having the baby.

47:34.652 --> 47:37.320
Are you fucking with me?

47:37.322 --> 47:38.621
I wish I were.

47:38.623 --> 47:40.923
Fine.
Go have your damn infant.

47:40.925 --> 47:42.859
Just don't expect
to get paid.

47:42.861 --> 47:43.860
Jaxi:
<i> 'Cause you didn't</i>
<i> do shit!</i>

47:43.862 --> 47:46.629
I don't.
It's... I don't.

47:46.631 --> 47:48.931
Bye, loser.

47:50.067 --> 47:52.034
Jaxi:
I thought he was gay.

48:16.994 --> 48:18.594
Sorry.

48:20.197 --> 48:22.265
Hi. Maternity?

48:25.102 --> 48:26.402
Sorry.

48:27.704 --> 48:30.172
Hi. What's happening?

48:30.174 --> 48:32.008
Baby,
this is doctor Siegel.

48:32.010 --> 48:33.609
This is my husband, guy.

48:33.611 --> 48:35.978
Hi. Is it coming out?

48:35.980 --> 48:38.614
Uh... it is,
but not today.

48:38.616 --> 48:41.183
He says
I'm not even dilated.

48:41.185 --> 48:43.185
But okay--
what about the pain?

48:43.187 --> 48:45.821
Well, your wife was
experiencing false labor.

48:45.823 --> 48:48.257
Which is not uncommon
during the first pregnancy.

48:48.259 --> 48:49.759
Could be brought on
by anything really.

48:49.761 --> 48:51.460
Dehydration, stress...

48:51.462 --> 48:54.664
We started a saline drip
just to kind of settle
things down.

48:54.666 --> 48:56.666
I'm already
feeling better.

48:56.668 --> 48:59.235
Oh, thank god.

49:01.238 --> 49:05.775
Oh, thank god.
I cannot have this kid yet.

49:05.777 --> 49:08.044
Well, she is coming out
sooner or later.

49:08.046 --> 49:09.879
I'm gonna go make a note
in your chart.

49:09.881 --> 49:11.647
I'll be back in a bit
to take that drip out.

49:11.649 --> 49:13.683
Anne:
<i> Thank you.</i>

49:17.354 --> 49:19.055
You know, it really hurts
my feelings

49:19.057 --> 49:20.990
when you say things
like that.

49:20.992 --> 49:22.358
Oh.

49:22.360 --> 49:25.895
I don't mean to upset you.
I'm just...

49:25.897 --> 49:27.196
I'm just being honest.

49:27.198 --> 49:29.065
I'm not ready.

49:29.067 --> 49:32.935
<i> What if I just suck</i>
<i> at being a dad? Really.</i>

49:32.937 --> 49:35.871
What if I'm
a bad provider,

49:35.873 --> 49:38.207
financially and emotionally?

49:38.209 --> 49:39.875
I mean,
think about it, Annie.

49:39.877 --> 49:42.945
We are bringing
an actual human,

49:42.947 --> 49:46.515
a real human life
into this world.

49:46.517 --> 49:48.417
She's gonna be a person.

49:48.419 --> 49:52.288
And everything that
she is and is going to be

49:52.290 --> 49:52.288
depends upon us.

49:52.290 --> 49:55.791
<i> What made us think</i>
<i> we could do that?</i>

49:55.793 --> 49:58.627
<i> What if we're not</i>
<i> up to the job?</i>

49:58.629 --> 50:02.198
I just spent two hours
with three women whose parents

50:02.200 --> 50:04.967
clearly did something wrong
because there's no way

50:04.969 --> 50:07.069
a well-adjusted person

50:07.071 --> 50:09.071
would stick licorice rope
up their-

50:09.073 --> 50:11.340
licorice rope?
I love licorice rope.

50:11.342 --> 50:15.911
Yeah, me too.
I was just saying
how I wish I had some.

50:15.913 --> 50:18.347
Can't help ya there,
but you're lucky

50:18.349 --> 50:20.049
you got a doctor
with a sweet tooth.

50:20.051 --> 50:22.418
Would you care
for a fruit burst?

50:22.420 --> 50:24.587
No, thank you.

50:25.822 --> 50:27.757
Baby, what if you're
right?

50:27.759 --> 50:29.959
What if she hates us?

50:29.961 --> 50:32.294
Why wouldn't she?
I hate my parents.

50:32.296 --> 50:34.163
You do not hate
your parents.

50:34.165 --> 50:37.833
Well, I do.
I mean, I don't totally
love my parents.

50:37.835 --> 50:40.636
I wouldn't choose
to hang out with them.

50:40.638 --> 50:42.004
What if she feels
about me

50:42.006 --> 50:44.340
the way that I feel
about my mom?

50:44.342 --> 50:46.042
Oh, my god.

50:46.044 --> 50:48.044
I'd kill myself.

50:48.046 --> 50:50.046
Sign here, and here...

50:50.048 --> 50:51.947
Pay that much now,

50:51.949 --> 50:54.583
and then mail this form
into the insurance

50:54.585 --> 50:56.152
to get
your reimbursement.

50:56.154 --> 50:59.188
If we still have
insurance by then.

50:59.190 --> 51:00.456
Man.

51:00.458 --> 51:04.427
That's about how much
Nikki said I'd make tonight.

51:04.429 --> 51:06.228
What, the hookers?

51:06.230 --> 51:10.199
Yeah, there was a lotta money
flying around.

51:10.201 --> 51:14.904
But I'm done.
Thank you.

51:14.906 --> 51:17.907
Come on. Let's get you
home and into bed.

51:17.909 --> 51:20.109
You should probably
come with me.

51:20.111 --> 51:23.012
No, I don't want
to leave my car here.
I'll drive.

51:23.014 --> 51:24.013
Are you sure?
I'll meet you there.

51:24.015 --> 51:25.681
You sure? You sure?

51:25.683 --> 51:26.749
I love you.
I love you.

51:26.751 --> 51:29.385
All right,
I'll meet you at home.

51:34.391 --> 51:36.926
Ma'am, is there
a water fountain
around here?

51:36.928 --> 51:38.627
Right around the corner
to the right.

51:38.629 --> 51:40.329
Thank you.

51:55.946 --> 51:57.379
You?

51:58.882 --> 52:00.616
You.

52:12.162 --> 52:15.197
Orderly: Doctor?
Doctor kurtz?

52:15.199 --> 52:16.298
Yes.

52:16.300 --> 52:18.868
Is he...?
Is that a patient?

52:18.870 --> 52:22.771
Hey... code grey!
Code grey!

52:22.773 --> 52:24.807
Oh shit.

52:27.545 --> 52:31.881
Woman on pa system:
<i> Dr. grey, Dr. grey.</i>
<i> North wing.</i>

52:31.883 --> 52:35.451
<i> Dr. grey, Dr. grey.</i>
<i> North wing.</i>

53:10.220 --> 53:14.390
Guy: Oh jeez!
Kurtz: Shh.

53:16.326 --> 53:17.960
I just filled this syringe

53:17.962 --> 53:19.862
with 1.1 milliliters
of anectine.

53:19.864 --> 53:23.065
Enough to paralyze you
for several hours.

53:23.067 --> 53:26.535
It's a very disagreeable
experience.

53:26.537 --> 53:30.406
Whatta you say
we go look up Nikki, huh?

53:30.408 --> 53:31.874
Okay.

53:31.876 --> 53:33.342
Come on.

53:38.348 --> 53:40.816
What are you planning
on doing to her?

53:42.519 --> 53:44.553
I don't know yet.

53:44.555 --> 53:47.556
You're really starting
to sound like a creepy doctor,
you know that?

53:47.558 --> 53:51.594
Yeah. You know what?
Just keep driving.

53:51.596 --> 53:53.963
What happened
wasn't her fault.

53:53.965 --> 53:55.698
It was mine.

53:55.700 --> 53:58.334
I'm new to this.
I thought she was
being tortured.

53:58.336 --> 53:59.768
I pay extra for that.

53:59.770 --> 54:01.337
I know that now,

54:01.339 --> 54:03.305
but I think you can appreciate
the misunderstanding.

54:03.307 --> 54:06.875
I mean,
if you heard what I heard...
It sounded pretty extreme.

54:08.912 --> 54:10.512
Obviously,
you have issues.

54:10.514 --> 54:12.748
Maybe you should
consider therapy?

54:12.750 --> 54:15.584
Or you might want to rethink
the missionary position.

54:15.586 --> 54:17.019
It still works.

54:17.021 --> 54:19.188
Rather well,
as a matter of fact.

54:19.190 --> 54:21.790
And it leaves s lot
less room for confusion.

54:21.792 --> 54:23.859
Shut the fuck up.

54:26.096 --> 54:29.031
I don't think you realize
how lucky you are.

54:29.033 --> 54:30.466
You're a doctor.

54:30.468 --> 54:32.935
You're getting to do,
what I imagine,

54:32.937 --> 54:33.936
you've always wanted
to do--

54:33.938 --> 54:35.237
and getting
paid for it.

54:35.239 --> 54:36.672
Do you know
how rare that is?

54:36.674 --> 54:38.240
Most people work
their whole lives

54:38.242 --> 54:39.908
and never get
that chance.

54:39.910 --> 54:41.277
You go in there
half-cocked,

54:41.279 --> 54:42.911
you're throwing it
all away.

54:42.913 --> 54:44.947
Your medical license?
Gone.

54:44.949 --> 54:46.982
And for what?

54:46.984 --> 54:50.619
Go! Go! Go!

54:50.621 --> 54:53.522
Another thing, doctor,
i googled your house.

54:53.524 --> 54:55.624
It is a Paul Williams.
1953.

54:55.626 --> 54:59.428
Preservation boards
go crazy for him

54:59.430 --> 55:01.497
because he was black,
working in an all-white
hierarchy.

55:01.499 --> 55:03.565
Guy: You could get
landmark status.

55:03.567 --> 55:05.334
Are you
fucking kidding me?

55:05.336 --> 55:08.003
Guy:
Nikki. Shit.

55:08.005 --> 55:10.105
Guy: Nikki, don't move.

55:10.107 --> 55:12.841
Doctor, please don't.

55:12.843 --> 55:16.412
Listen to me,
think about it.
Think about all of it.

55:16.414 --> 55:17.813
You get landmark status.

55:17.815 --> 55:23.018
Which, on your house,
means no property taxes!

55:23.020 --> 55:25.187
That's huge
cash savings.

55:33.129 --> 55:34.463
Holy shit!

55:34.465 --> 55:36.498
Why the fuck did
you bring him here?

55:36.500 --> 55:38.767
What? I...

55:38.769 --> 55:40.202
Did you not just see...?

55:40.204 --> 55:42.137
He kidnapped me!

55:42.139 --> 55:46.675
Dr. fucking strangelove
works at our hospital.

55:46.677 --> 55:49.511
He was hell bent
on getting revenge
or something.

55:49.513 --> 55:51.213
Nikki: <i> I guess he's</i>
<i> shit outta luck.</i>

55:51.215 --> 55:53.048
Guy:
Yeah, it looks that way.

55:53.050 --> 55:55.184
I hope to fuck
he's not dead.

55:55.186 --> 55:57.920
No, he's just paralyzed
for a couple of hours.

55:57.922 --> 56:00.989
It's a...

56:00.991 --> 56:03.459
Thing. It's a neck...
Whatever.

56:03.461 --> 56:06.161
Awesome. So what's
the deal with your baby?

56:06.163 --> 56:08.197
False alarm.

56:08.199 --> 56:11.734
Well, since you're here,
want your old job back?

56:16.272 --> 56:19.608
Come on, doc.
I got you.

56:22.178 --> 56:24.179
Look what the cat
dragged in.

56:24.181 --> 56:26.648
Hey! Now the party's
gonna get really crazy!

56:26.650 --> 56:30.052
Pull up a bottle, "driver."
We're in the home stretch.

56:31.621 --> 56:34.590
Hey, can you
hook that for me, love?

56:34.592 --> 56:37.025
Oh, yeah.

56:37.027 --> 56:39.461
That's not one
of the regular kiss
guys, is it?

56:39.463 --> 56:42.331
No, it's Eric carr.
He's the best.

56:42.333 --> 56:44.466
He replaced Peter criss
on the drums.

56:44.468 --> 56:47.102
Guy: <i> Good to know.</i>
Yeah, he's a fox.

56:47.104 --> 56:49.538
How can you tell?
He's got paint
all over his face.

56:49.540 --> 56:51.240
No, I mean, literally.

56:51.242 --> 56:53.909
He's a fox, like,
that's his character.

56:53.911 --> 56:55.411
Her mom
slept with him once.

56:55.413 --> 56:57.346
That's fallon's
big claim to fame,

56:57.348 --> 56:59.748
she could have been
the kiss drummer's daughter.

56:59.750 --> 57:03.085
Nikki: Okay, this is it.
The big finale.

57:03.087 --> 57:06.789
We're lookin'
to get five bills.
It's up to you.

57:06.791 --> 57:10.993
At this point,
there's pretty much nothing
that'll shock me.

57:10.995 --> 57:12.795
Except this.

57:12.797 --> 57:16.698
We're looking
to get every single
mother fuckin' dollar.

57:16.700 --> 57:19.835
Fallon: Yeah.
Work it down to the bone.

57:21.639 --> 57:23.539
I'm ticklish.
Balls out.

57:24.407 --> 57:25.941
Man:
This guy?

57:25.943 --> 57:28.310
All right, everybody.

57:28.312 --> 57:30.078
Guy:
Alright, alright.

57:32.650 --> 57:36.418
Listen, this is the moment
you've all been waiting for.

57:40.623 --> 57:44.026
It's time
for the girl-on-girl...

57:44.028 --> 57:48.263
On-girl sex show.

57:48.265 --> 57:49.398
Now, now listen,

57:49.400 --> 57:53.669
this is one hot, sick show.

57:53.671 --> 57:57.539
Everything you see
is real.

57:57.541 --> 58:00.409
I'm serious. Everything.
One hundred percent.

58:00.411 --> 58:02.711
None of it is fake.
Listen, listen...

58:05.583 --> 58:08.517
All right, all right.
Stop it!

58:08.519 --> 58:10.752
Guy: You want proof?
Man: <i> Bullshit!</i>

58:10.754 --> 58:14.523
Our girl fallon,
she's gonna prove it.

58:14.525 --> 58:18.427
There's no way to fake
what she's about to do.

58:18.429 --> 58:21.763
Guy:
Okay, it is the real deal.

58:21.765 --> 58:25.133
Now I don't wanna ruin
the surprise

58:25.135 --> 58:27.669
but suffice to say,

58:27.671 --> 58:30.739
you might not
wanna sit too close.

58:34.578 --> 58:36.979
I need to see the money.
Help me out.

58:36.981 --> 58:39.581
'Cause I can't--
we can't go forward
without the money!

58:39.583 --> 58:42.117
So what do you say?
How about some money?

58:46.423 --> 58:47.956
You guys are very smart.

58:47.958 --> 58:49.458
'Cause you just bought
yourself a memory

58:49.460 --> 58:53.795
that you will
never ever forget. Boom.

58:58.369 --> 59:00.669
What I tell you?

59:02.238 --> 59:04.740
Woo!

01:00:12.942 --> 01:00:15.344
Anne: <i> Where'd you go?</i>
<i> I thought you were</i>
<i> right behind me?</i>

01:00:15.346 --> 01:00:17.813
Guy: I got sidelined.
Anne: <i> By what?</i>

01:00:17.815 --> 01:00:19.781
It's a long story,
try not to be mad,

01:00:19.783 --> 01:00:22.651
but, I'm back at the hotel.

01:00:22.653 --> 01:00:24.753
Now you've got me
thinking about this baby.

01:00:24.755 --> 01:00:27.589
What if I hate her?
What if she's ugly?

01:00:27.591 --> 01:00:30.258
What if she has one
of those giant raspberry
birthmarks

01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:32.027
on her face and I can't
bond with her

01:00:32.029 --> 01:00:33.795
because I can't
even look at her?

01:00:33.797 --> 01:00:35.430
<i> What if I hate her</i>
<i> because she's beautiful,</i>

01:00:35.432 --> 01:00:37.566
more beautiful than I am?

01:00:37.568 --> 01:00:40.002
And I get super jealous
of her and resentful

01:00:40.004 --> 01:00:42.471
<i> and competitive because</i>
<i> she has six pack abs...</i>

01:00:42.473 --> 01:00:43.972
Nikki:
<i>Guy, come on.</i>

01:00:43.974 --> 01:00:45.774
While I bust my ass
at crossfit every week

01:00:45.776 --> 01:00:47.843
and still have this weird
an inner tube around my waist?

01:00:47.845 --> 01:00:52.314
Oh, my god, guy,
i feel the postpartum
already setting in.

01:00:52.316 --> 01:00:54.082
<i> Does California have a law</i>

01:00:54.084 --> 01:00:55.684
<i> where you can drop off</i>
<i> a baby at a fire station--</i>

01:00:55.686 --> 01:00:58.820
babe, babe, babe, babe.
You're spinning.

01:00:58.822 --> 01:01:01.490
I know! That's why I need
you to come home right now!

01:01:01.492 --> 01:01:04.760
The party isn't over yet.

01:01:04.762 --> 01:01:07.229
We need to clean up
and get these girls home.

01:01:07.231 --> 01:01:09.264
<i> Look, just try to relax.</i>

01:01:09.266 --> 01:01:14.002
Try to lay down.
Lay down and make
some chamomile tea.

01:01:14.004 --> 01:01:15.170
Guy: <i> Just calm--</i>

01:01:15.172 --> 01:01:17.005
Anne: I can't calm down!

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:19.074
You know why,
because I don't
have a "me"

01:01:19.076 --> 01:01:21.643
to calm me down
like I do for you!

01:01:21.645 --> 01:01:23.712
The one time
i need a "me,"

01:01:23.714 --> 01:01:24.980
<i>you're not here!</i>

01:01:24.982 --> 01:01:27.816
Babe? Babe?

01:01:44.701 --> 01:01:45.767
Fallon:
<i> Oh, yeah!</i>

01:01:45.769 --> 01:01:48.770
<i> Go! Go! Go!</i>

01:01:53.076 --> 01:01:56.144
Crowd:
Oh!

01:01:57.246 --> 01:01:59.981
Oh, my god!
That's so wrong!

01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:13.128
Go clean yourself up.

01:02:13.130 --> 01:02:14.796
What is that stuff?

01:02:14.798 --> 01:02:17.766
Nobody knows.
But you should clean it off.

01:02:20.337 --> 01:02:23.238
I think I'm in love.

01:02:37.386 --> 01:02:39.354
Oh, shit.

01:02:53.469 --> 01:02:55.237
We got robbed.

01:02:55.239 --> 01:02:57.272
Robbed?

01:02:57.274 --> 01:02:58.406
As in, someone came in here

01:02:58.408 --> 01:03:00.208
and snaked all our cash.

01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:01.843
Wait, are you sure?

01:03:01.845 --> 01:03:05.413
This was full.
Now it's not.

01:03:05.415 --> 01:03:06.982
Who would do something
like that?

01:03:06.984 --> 01:03:09.184
One of those
limp dick fuck boys.

01:03:09.186 --> 01:03:10.852
You killed yourselves
for that money!

01:03:10.854 --> 01:03:13.288
I wouldn't go
that far, but, yeah,

01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:14.623
it took some effort.

01:03:14.625 --> 01:03:16.391
Hold on, wait.

01:03:16.393 --> 01:03:20.061
Maybe-- maybe--
maybe it like just fell out
or something.

01:03:20.063 --> 01:03:20.061
It didn't.

01:03:20.063 --> 01:03:25.300
Well, we should at least
have look around for it,
don't you think?

01:03:25.302 --> 01:03:29.704
I agree.
Let's look for it.

01:03:29.706 --> 01:03:33.575
Fallon: Mother fuckers!
Jaxi: Yeah, somebody's
about to get fucked up.

01:03:33.577 --> 01:03:35.644
It's not under here.

01:03:35.646 --> 01:03:37.279
Wait! Ladies.

01:03:42.084 --> 01:03:43.752
Hey, party's
goin' great, man.

01:03:43.754 --> 01:03:45.687
That show
was a mind fuck.
Yeah, sure was.

01:03:45.689 --> 01:03:48.690
We gotta talk about
that thing we were talkin'
about. The extras?

01:03:48.692 --> 01:03:51.159
Yeah, that's not
happening right now.

01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:52.561
What the fuck?

01:03:52.563 --> 01:03:53.895
You said we'd get extras.

01:03:53.897 --> 01:03:55.363
You gave me your word.

01:03:55.365 --> 01:03:57.499
We got robbed,
motherfucker.

01:03:57.501 --> 01:03:59.668
Either you make up
the difference

01:03:59.670 --> 01:04:01.636
or we don't let
anyone outta here.

01:04:01.638 --> 01:04:02.871
You're high.

01:04:02.873 --> 01:04:04.306
None of these guys
would rob you.

01:04:04.308 --> 01:04:05.807
They're all agents.

01:04:05.809 --> 01:04:08.276
Suit yourselves.

01:04:08.278 --> 01:04:10.812
Ladies, lock the doors.

01:04:10.814 --> 01:04:13.582
This is ridiculous.
I'm calling security.

01:04:13.584 --> 01:04:14.749
No, you ain't.

01:04:14.751 --> 01:04:16.551
Uh-oh.
Shit just got real.

01:04:16.553 --> 01:04:18.753
Wha-- Nikki, whoa.
Nikki...

01:04:18.755 --> 01:04:20.488
You never
mentioned guns.

01:04:20.490 --> 01:04:22.324
I thought we
were gonna talk.

01:04:22.326 --> 01:04:23.925
We are gonna talk.

01:04:23.927 --> 01:04:25.727
This helps them listen.

01:04:25.729 --> 01:04:28.964
Okay, people.
We got a situation here.

01:04:28.966 --> 01:04:31.800
One of you boners
stole my money.

01:04:31.802 --> 01:04:34.636
Nobody is leaving
this fucking hotel

01:04:34.638 --> 01:04:36.137
until I get it back.

01:04:36.139 --> 01:04:40.442
I want all of you cunts
on the carpet.

01:04:40.444 --> 01:04:42.110
Now!

01:04:42.112 --> 01:04:46.147
Jaxi:
<i> Yeah, who's taking their</i>
<i> dicks out now, bitch?</i>

01:04:46.149 --> 01:04:48.149
He gets a pass.

01:04:49.819 --> 01:04:51.119
You can take whatever I got.

01:04:51.121 --> 01:04:52.787
Take my wallet.
Take anything.

01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:55.857
I don't want your wallet, prick.
I want my money.

01:04:55.859 --> 01:04:57.259
The money I earned.

01:04:57.261 --> 01:04:58.894
Fallon:
Yeah, the money we earned.

01:04:58.896 --> 01:05:00.729
Nikki:
Guy, check 'em.

01:05:00.731 --> 01:05:02.497
Check 'em.

01:05:03.499 --> 01:05:04.766
Aren't you two cozy.

01:05:04.768 --> 01:05:04.766
Fucking guys spooning.

01:05:04.768 --> 01:05:09.070
Jaxi: <i> This one's clean.</i>
Fallon: <i> This guy's clean.</i>

01:05:13.442 --> 01:05:14.843
Clean. Move!

01:05:14.845 --> 01:05:18.647
Guy: Clean here.
Fallon: Ooh, library card.

01:05:18.649 --> 01:05:20.882
Guy: Clean.
Fallon: Munch some carpet!

01:05:20.884 --> 01:05:23.685
I touched his penis.
Sorry. Clean.

01:05:23.687 --> 01:05:26.121
Jaxi: <i> Clean.</i>
Nikki: <i> Check his pants.</i>

01:05:27.056 --> 01:05:29.124
Help!
Congratulations, dude.

01:05:29.126 --> 01:05:31.293
Man: Thank you.
Guy: Sorry. Clean.

01:05:31.295 --> 01:05:33.061
What about him?

01:05:33.063 --> 01:05:34.796
Hey, you don't
have to worry about me.

01:05:34.798 --> 01:05:36.631
I mean,
you know I'm cool.

01:05:36.633 --> 01:05:39.434
Jaxi: <i> Clean.</i>
Fallon: <i> Clean.</i>

01:05:46.042 --> 01:05:48.610
Hey, man.
I got laid off six months ago.

01:05:48.612 --> 01:05:51.346
I had to do it.
I'll split it with you.

01:05:51.348 --> 01:05:53.815
Nikki: <i> I know one of you</i>
<i> boners stole this shit!</i>

01:05:53.817 --> 01:05:56.985
Come on, man,
help out a bro.

01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:11.199
It's this one.

01:06:11.201 --> 01:06:12.834
You dick!

01:06:12.836 --> 01:06:15.537
We got a runner!
Get him!

01:06:23.981 --> 01:06:26.481
Fallon:
Go! Go! Go!

01:06:26.483 --> 01:06:28.750
Move your ass, guy.

01:06:28.752 --> 01:06:30.552
Jaxi:
Elevator's not coming, bitch!

01:06:30.554 --> 01:06:33.021
Fallon:
Get over here, fucker!

01:06:34.523 --> 01:06:37.058
Stop right there!

01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:38.493
Jaxi:
<i>Please jump.</i>

01:06:38.495 --> 01:06:39.794
Hey...

01:06:39.796 --> 01:06:41.062
Make my fucking night.

01:06:41.064 --> 01:06:42.831
Oh, I was just messin'
with you guys.

01:06:42.833 --> 01:06:45.233
I was totally
gonna give it back.

01:06:46.736 --> 01:06:48.470
You idiot.

01:06:51.607 --> 01:06:54.409
It's right here.
Every cent.

01:06:54.411 --> 01:06:55.744
Frisk his ass.

01:06:55.746 --> 01:06:57.779
That's just...
Hey.

01:06:57.781 --> 01:06:59.781
Homeboy is
doughy as fuck.

01:06:59.783 --> 01:07:01.750
Look here.
I forgot about that. Sorry.

01:07:03.219 --> 01:07:05.920
Okay, I told you,
i was gonna give it back.

01:07:05.922 --> 01:07:07.155
I was just
bustin' your balls.

01:07:07.157 --> 01:07:09.257
Turn around
and get on your knees.

01:07:09.259 --> 01:07:12.394
What?
On your knees, fuck-tard!

01:07:12.396 --> 01:07:14.262
Jaxi:
You like to play games, right?

01:07:14.264 --> 01:07:16.631
What're you gonna do, guy?
Someone's about
to get fucked up.

01:07:16.633 --> 01:07:18.767
Guy, buddy, please, please,
don't let them hurt me, please.

01:07:18.769 --> 01:07:20.168
I'm so sorry!

01:07:20.170 --> 01:07:24.139
I'm so, so, so, so sorry!
Please...

01:07:24.141 --> 01:07:25.807
Guy: Nikki, Nikki...
Hey, listen.

01:07:25.809 --> 01:07:28.176
Ladies...
Piss on this fucker.

01:07:28.178 --> 01:07:30.278
Devon: What?
Fallon: Hell yeah!

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:32.447
Nikki, hold on,
that's just plain gross.

01:07:32.449 --> 01:07:37.085
You cannot pee-pee on me!
Guy, don't let them do this!

01:07:37.087 --> 01:07:39.421
Honey, my bladder's
about to burst.

01:07:39.423 --> 01:07:41.156
Nikki: Do you wanna
go first, or should I?

01:07:41.158 --> 01:07:42.924
You filthy bitches!

01:07:42.926 --> 01:07:46.361
No, don't don't don't!
Seriously, stop. Don't...

01:07:46.363 --> 01:07:48.063
Yeah, pee on him.

01:07:48.065 --> 01:07:50.632
Devon:
Oh god, stop. No!

01:07:50.634 --> 01:07:52.400
Nikki:
Rainbow kiss!

01:07:58.208 --> 01:08:00.108
Devon:
It's in my mouth!

01:08:00.110 --> 01:08:02.410
Fallon, what the fuck
are you doing?

01:08:02.412 --> 01:08:03.578
You said pee on him.

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:05.580
He's blindfolded.

01:08:05.582 --> 01:08:07.649
He can't tell
the difference!

01:08:07.651 --> 01:08:09.050
Well,
i really had to go.

01:08:09.052 --> 01:08:12.287
Devon:
You nasty, filthy bitches!

01:08:12.289 --> 01:08:16.390
Wait. Why does she get
to pee on him and I don't?

01:08:16.393 --> 01:08:18.760
Fallon: Give it back to me,
motherfucker!

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:19.961
Jaxi:
Bitch!

01:08:19.962 --> 01:08:21.830
Jaxi:
Smells like asparagus.

01:08:23.599 --> 01:08:25.300
Hey, man.

01:08:26.969 --> 01:08:30.505
Good thing she didn't
have to poop, huh?

01:08:32.608 --> 01:08:34.309
What?

01:08:51.594 --> 01:08:53.495
Having fun yet?

01:08:55.363 --> 01:08:58.700
Is this what every
Saturday night is like?

01:08:58.702 --> 01:09:00.902
Pretty much.

01:09:00.904 --> 01:09:02.804
How do you survive?

01:09:05.174 --> 01:09:07.175
Smooth jazz helps.

01:09:09.178 --> 01:09:11.946
I think I might need
something stronger.

01:09:11.948 --> 01:09:14.381
Smooth metal.

01:09:15.216 --> 01:09:17.952
Why are you
such a stress case?

01:09:17.953 --> 01:09:21.322
Oh, I don't know.

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:23.158
Because I'm about
to have a kid.

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:25.560
I don't have a career.

01:09:25.562 --> 01:09:28.095
Your kid doesn't
need you to have a career.

01:09:28.098 --> 01:09:30.598
Really?
What does she need?

01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:35.803
For you to basically
do what you've been
doing tonight with us.

01:09:35.805 --> 01:09:40.207
Okay, I think you and I have
very different philosophies

01:09:40.210 --> 01:09:42.810
on how to raise kids.

01:09:42.812 --> 01:09:44.212
I don't know.

01:09:44.214 --> 01:09:47.582
No, I think it boils down
to a ride and protection.

01:09:47.584 --> 01:09:49.917
Sure you can throw in
washing their stuff

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:51.152
and picking up after them,

01:09:51.154 --> 01:09:53.555
which, incidentally,
you also did tonight.

01:09:53.557 --> 01:09:56.958
But mostly,

01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:59.527
kids just need a ride
and protection.

01:09:59.529 --> 01:10:02.630
It doesn't matter
if you drive a Porsche
or a Pontiac.

01:10:02.632 --> 01:10:05.900
As long as the kid knows
that you're gonna be there
on time

01:10:05.902 --> 01:10:07.202
and they're
gonna be safe,

01:10:07.204 --> 01:10:08.870
it's a job done.

01:10:12.041 --> 01:10:14.909
We both know
you can do that.

01:10:14.911 --> 01:10:18.713
You can do that
like a champ.

01:10:18.715 --> 01:10:20.848
Now, look...

01:10:20.850 --> 01:10:22.850
Now before we clear out
of the room,

01:10:22.852 --> 01:10:25.553
do an idiot check.
Come on.

01:10:39.168 --> 01:10:42.303
Hey, ladies, hold up.

01:10:43.339 --> 01:10:46.407
I've got
something of yours.

01:10:46.409 --> 01:10:48.576
Oh my god,
these are my favorites.

01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:50.812
Someone was supposed
to collect all the panties.

01:10:50.814 --> 01:10:53.248
Man:
They were under the couch.

01:10:53.250 --> 01:10:57.151
I'm just glad I was able
to get 'em back to you.

01:10:57.153 --> 01:10:58.920
Well, thanks.

01:11:01.290 --> 01:11:04.826
Man: It really was
a dynamite show.

01:11:04.828 --> 01:11:06.094
I'd also like to say

01:11:06.096 --> 01:11:08.997
I'm sorry for what
happened back there.

01:11:08.999 --> 01:11:10.131
Some guys...

01:11:10.133 --> 01:11:11.232
They just don't
say a lot

01:11:11.234 --> 01:11:14.035
for the male gender,
now do they?

01:11:14.037 --> 01:11:16.137
Yeah, well, if it wasn't
for the male gender,

01:11:16.139 --> 01:11:18.172
we wouldn't have jobs.

01:11:18.174 --> 01:11:21.276
True, which leads me
to my next point.

01:11:21.278 --> 01:11:22.910
Now, I know you said
you guys were done...

01:11:22.912 --> 01:11:24.545
Here we go.

01:11:24.547 --> 01:11:26.347
Dude, go home.

01:11:26.349 --> 01:11:28.616
Bust a load off
in your sink.

01:11:28.618 --> 01:11:32.020
I got two hundies burnin'
a hole in my pocket.

01:11:32.022 --> 01:11:33.888
My truck is
right in the corner,

01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:37.058
so, what do ya say?

01:11:42.931 --> 01:11:45.233
What the hell.
Awesome.

01:11:45.235 --> 01:11:49.070
This will just take
a few seconds, no offense.

01:11:49.072 --> 01:11:50.371
Come on.

01:11:50.373 --> 01:11:52.740
Some taken.
But... yeah. Shall we?

01:11:56.045 --> 01:11:59.147
My cousin made
over a million bucks
selling vitamins.

01:11:59.149 --> 01:12:00.548
Fallon:
Maybe coke vitamins.

01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:03.051
No, bitch.
Real fucking vitamins.

01:12:03.053 --> 01:12:04.552
Nu-uh.
Yeah-huh.

01:12:04.554 --> 01:12:06.854
Fallon: Okay, that was
so black-ish of you.

01:12:06.856 --> 01:12:09.490
Jaxi: <i> Bitch, I am black.</i>
<i> Stop fucking playing</i>
<i> with me like that, fallon.</i>

01:12:09.492 --> 01:12:14.395
So is she gonna go all
the way with that guy,
right over there?

01:12:14.397 --> 01:12:16.764
Jaxi:
What're you, 12?

01:12:16.766 --> 01:12:17.899
I'm just sayin'.

01:12:17.901 --> 01:12:20.201
Oh, he's worried.

01:12:20.203 --> 01:12:21.903
You worried
about her, pops?

01:12:21.905 --> 01:12:25.973
Well, when you
actually think about it,
it is worrisome.

01:12:25.975 --> 01:12:28.209
Jaxi: <i> Okay, here's</i>
<i> what they don't teach you</i>

01:12:28.211 --> 01:12:29.944
<i> when you buy a ticket</i>
<i> at the door.</i>

01:12:29.946 --> 01:12:31.446
Pros, do the
absolute minimum.

01:12:31.448 --> 01:12:33.981
That means, we dance
a little, talk dirty...

01:12:33.983 --> 01:12:36.451
Finger ourselves.
Maybe a hand job.

01:12:36.453 --> 01:12:39.654
If he can get it up,
which, more than likely,
he can't.

01:12:39.656 --> 01:12:42.957
Exactly. These guys
are so full of vodka
and whatnot,

01:12:42.959 --> 01:12:44.992
it's mostly babysitting.

01:12:44.994 --> 01:12:47.095
That's why
they call it a trick.

01:12:47.097 --> 01:12:50.331
Professionals,
rarely, if ever,

01:12:50.333 --> 01:12:52.166
give up the cookie.

01:12:52.168 --> 01:12:55.203
No fucking way.
Oh, my god, this cannot
be fucking happening.

01:12:55.205 --> 01:12:57.839
What's not happening?
Fallon: The guy from the party.
He's busting Nikki!

01:12:57.841 --> 01:13:00.108
He's a fucking cop,
we gotta get out of here.

01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:01.309
Yeah, yeah.
Guy, drive!

01:13:01.311 --> 01:13:02.677
What about Nikki?

01:13:02.679 --> 01:13:04.145
Nikki's going to jail
right now,

01:13:04.147 --> 01:13:05.713
which is not where
we're goin',

01:13:05.715 --> 01:13:07.982
so you need to drive
this fucking car

01:13:07.984 --> 01:13:09.417
before I do it for you.

01:13:09.419 --> 01:13:11.552
We can't leave.
What 'cause of Nikki?

01:13:11.554 --> 01:13:15.022
Fucking drive the car!
Back the fuck up!

01:13:15.024 --> 01:13:17.458
Fallon:
Let's go!

01:13:19.328 --> 01:13:22.029
Jaxi: <i> What the fuck?</i>
Fallon: <i> What're you doin'?</i>

01:13:22.031 --> 01:13:22.029
Fallon:
Come on, dude.

01:13:22.031 --> 01:13:25.433
Jaxi: <i> What the fuck?</i>
Fallon: <i> Why are you stopping?</i>

01:13:25.435 --> 01:13:27.168
Jaxi: <i> What are you doing?</i>
Fallon: <i> Keep going!</i>

01:13:27.170 --> 01:13:29.203
Jaxi: <i> Drive forward!</i>
<i>What the fuck?</i>

01:13:29.205 --> 01:13:31.506
Fallon:
<i> Press the fucking pedal!</i>

01:13:35.478 --> 01:13:37.845
Man:
Whoa, hey!

01:13:37.847 --> 01:13:38.946
Go! Go! Go!

01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:42.850
Hey!

01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:50.391
Fuck!
You did not just do that!

01:13:50.393 --> 01:13:52.193
What the fuck,
Tokyo drift?

01:13:52.195 --> 01:13:53.761
I don't see 'em
in the back.

01:13:53.763 --> 01:13:56.230
Jaxi: That's because
there's nobody behind us.

01:13:56.232 --> 01:13:58.766
Tokyo drift,
you did it!

01:14:06.842 --> 01:14:08.109
Oh, fuck!

01:14:08.111 --> 01:14:10.044
Ah...
Is everyone okay?

01:14:10.046 --> 01:14:11.279
Not really.

01:14:11.281 --> 01:14:12.847
What happened?

01:14:12.849 --> 01:14:14.315
We're fucked.

01:14:14.317 --> 01:14:16.417
Fallon: Oh my god, you guys,
jail fucking sucks.

01:14:16.419 --> 01:14:19.754
Jaxi: But on a Saturday night,
jail sucks donkey dick.

01:14:19.756 --> 01:14:23.057
Hold on. Stop it.
No one's going to jail.

01:14:23.059 --> 01:14:25.426
Guy.
Unless you can fly...

01:14:25.428 --> 01:14:28.229
Come on, come on.
Let's go!

01:14:33.202 --> 01:14:34.535
All right.
Guys, come on.

01:14:34.537 --> 01:14:36.237
Nikki:
Even if you leave the car,

01:14:36.239 --> 01:14:37.638
they're still gonna
arrest you at home.

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:40.107
But they're not
gonna arrest you.
Come on!

01:14:40.109 --> 01:14:43.144
Jaxi:
Down the alley. Go!

01:14:50.452 --> 01:14:53.221
Officer: <i> Adam 12 to dispatch</i>
<i>of the 29th alleyway</i>
<i>of 3rd and 4th...</i>

01:14:53.223 --> 01:14:54.889
<i> We're requesting</i>
<i> additional units, over.</i>

01:14:54.891 --> 01:14:56.424
Officer 2:
Let's head 'em off
at temple.

01:14:56.426 --> 01:14:58.526
Let's move, let's move

01:15:10.038 --> 01:15:13.941
jaxi: Come on!
Hey, wait for the white people!

01:15:17.513 --> 01:15:19.080
Jaxi:
Oh, watch out for that.

01:15:22.284 --> 01:15:24.051
Hey, hey, hey!

01:15:55.150 --> 01:15:56.617
Nikki:
We lost them.

01:15:56.619 --> 01:15:59.186
Jaxi: Who are the baddest
bitches on the planet?

01:15:59.188 --> 01:16:02.023
We are!
Nobody's fucking
with us!

01:16:03.492 --> 01:16:06.594
I'd hug you right now...
If I had arms.

01:16:08.697 --> 01:16:10.865
I guess I got
a little carried away.

01:16:10.867 --> 01:16:12.900
Just a teeny tiny.

01:16:15.538 --> 01:16:17.438
Hey, do you have
a Bobby pin?

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:19.674
Sparkly or regular?

01:16:19.676 --> 01:16:21.409
Fallon!

01:16:21.411 --> 01:16:23.244
Jeez.
Give it here.

01:16:24.913 --> 01:16:27.114
Jaxi:
<i> Wake your ass up, ho.</i>

01:16:27.116 --> 01:16:28.549
Fallon:
<i> Huh?</i>

01:16:28.551 --> 01:16:30.985
This is my souvenir.

01:16:30.987 --> 01:16:33.487
Wait. Aren't you
forgetting something?

01:16:33.489 --> 01:16:35.556
Oh yeah. My money.

01:16:35.558 --> 01:16:39.026
For such a bad night,
it was actually
pretty good.

01:16:40.629 --> 01:16:42.997
We have guy
to thank for this.

01:16:42.999 --> 01:16:46.300
You rocked harder
than Eric carr.

01:16:46.302 --> 01:16:48.235
The fox.

01:16:48.237 --> 01:16:50.304
You're
a stand-up guy, guy.

01:16:50.306 --> 01:16:52.039
Hey, you too. Well...

01:16:52.041 --> 01:16:53.741
I get it.

01:16:53.743 --> 01:16:55.643
I gotta get
this one to bed.

01:16:55.645 --> 01:16:57.845
Bye, guys.

01:16:59.314 --> 01:17:01.816
Guy, you can
drive me any time.

01:17:01.818 --> 01:17:04.585
As soon as I get
out of jail.

01:17:04.587 --> 01:17:06.487
Fallon:
Ahh, hold me.

01:17:08.591 --> 01:17:11.959
You're taking
the dog out.

01:17:18.634 --> 01:17:20.635
Nikki:
Can you wait a bit?

01:17:20.637 --> 01:17:22.970
Guy: It'll just be a sec,
i gotta take her bags up.

01:17:22.972 --> 01:17:25.606
Nikki: Well, actually,
it might be more than a sec.

01:17:25.608 --> 01:17:27.708
I wanna show you
something.

01:17:27.710 --> 01:17:30.845
After all you've done,
you deserve a reward.

01:17:39.354 --> 01:17:41.622
Can I get you a drink?

01:17:41.624 --> 01:17:44.258
Ahh...
No, thank you, I'm good.

01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:46.293
I'll be right back.

01:17:55.904 --> 01:17:57.772
Guy:
Wow.

01:17:57.774 --> 01:18:02.276
This is an impressive
amount of tea pots here.

01:18:02.278 --> 01:18:05.746
Nikki: <i> Thanks. Yeah,</i>
<i>I've been collecting 'em</i>
<i>forever.</i>

01:18:05.748 --> 01:18:08.516
<i> They're mostly vintage.</i>

01:18:08.518 --> 01:18:10.017
<i> I'm really into animal ones.</i>

01:18:10.019 --> 01:18:12.953
<i> I've gotten some</i>
<i> sick deals on ebay.</i>

01:18:14.289 --> 01:18:18.926
<i> See that elephant one</i>
<i> with the pink flower?</i>

01:18:18.928 --> 01:18:21.295
<i> Guess how much</i>
<i> I paid for that?</i>

01:18:21.297 --> 01:18:24.331
Uh, fifteen dollars?

01:18:24.333 --> 01:18:27.034
Ninety-nine cents.
Plus shipping.

01:18:27.036 --> 01:18:29.503
You can't beat that
with a stick.

01:18:29.505 --> 01:18:33.941
Wow. No, that is a sick deal.

01:18:34.943 --> 01:18:39.246
Wow, yeah...
Your place is...

01:18:39.248 --> 01:18:41.449
Very tastefully done.

01:18:47.889 --> 01:18:51.225
I'm glad you're
noticing these things.

01:18:51.227 --> 01:18:54.895
It's good, considering
why I brought you here.

01:19:00.736 --> 01:19:03.838
I want to show you
something.

01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:07.041
Something very personal.

01:19:15.317 --> 01:19:18.486
Nikki:
It's mine, that land.

01:19:18.488 --> 01:19:22.189
The only thing
it's missing is a house.

01:19:23.191 --> 01:19:25.793
A tasteful house.

01:19:29.331 --> 01:19:33.534
You realize,
building a house
from the ground up

01:19:33.536 --> 01:19:36.237
is incredibly expensive.

01:19:36.239 --> 01:19:40.407
I mean, it could be hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

01:19:40.409 --> 01:19:43.110
Guy, what do you
know about me?

01:19:44.146 --> 01:19:45.346
Not much.

01:19:45.348 --> 01:19:47.515
What's one thing
you do know?

01:19:50.118 --> 01:19:51.552
You like money?

01:19:51.554 --> 01:19:54.922
And do you think I spend it,
or save it?

01:19:57.659 --> 01:19:59.126
Save it?

01:19:59.128 --> 01:20:02.530
And if I've been
saving for eleven years,

01:20:02.532 --> 01:20:04.498
how much
do you think I have?

01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:06.167
A lot?

01:20:06.169 --> 01:20:08.569
Try a fuck of a lot.

01:20:10.005 --> 01:20:12.807
So when can I see
those drawings?

01:20:14.242 --> 01:20:16.577
Next week. Definitely.

01:20:16.579 --> 01:20:18.746
I expect a friends
and family discount.

01:20:18.748 --> 01:20:21.282
Yeah, without a doubt.

01:20:22.584 --> 01:20:24.885
Let me give you
my lawyer's details.

01:20:24.887 --> 01:20:27.888
Have your wife call
as soon as the police
arrest you.

01:20:27.890 --> 01:20:30.124
Tell her
Patricia referred you.

01:20:30.126 --> 01:20:33.260
That's your real name?
Patricia?

01:20:33.262 --> 01:20:35.062
Patricia cornbluth.

01:20:35.064 --> 01:20:38.999
Now beat it.
I need my beauty sleep.

01:20:39.001 --> 01:20:42.403
Thank you.
Patricia...

01:20:43.438 --> 01:20:45.039
Guy:
<i>Cornbluth.</i>

01:20:48.476 --> 01:20:50.010
Nikki:
Oh, and, guy?

01:20:50.012 --> 01:20:52.780
When you come back
with those drawings...

01:20:52.782 --> 01:20:55.616
These will be
waiting for you.

01:20:55.618 --> 01:20:59.086
I can't wait.

01:21:42.163 --> 01:21:44.231
You came back.

01:21:44.233 --> 01:21:46.967
Anne...

01:21:46.969 --> 01:21:50.838
I am so sorry
that I got us
into this mess,

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:53.040
but Nikki...

01:21:53.042 --> 01:21:57.745
She has this lawyer
who will handle
the entire thing,

01:21:57.747 --> 01:22:01.382
and she might not charge us,
as a favor to Nikki.

01:22:01.384 --> 01:22:04.752
I think if
i go peacefully,

01:22:04.754 --> 01:22:08.555
maybe they won't
come down too hard on me.

01:22:08.557 --> 01:22:10.791
What are you
talking about?

01:22:10.793 --> 01:22:14.561
Weren't... they here?
The police?

01:22:15.664 --> 01:22:17.298
No.

01:22:19.401 --> 01:22:21.068
Did they call?

01:22:21.070 --> 01:22:23.037
No, guy, no police
have come or called.

01:22:23.039 --> 01:22:25.439
What the hell
is going on?

01:22:31.012 --> 01:22:34.815
Maybe I dreamt
the whole thing.

01:22:34.817 --> 01:22:37.251
Anne: <i> Are you</i>
<i> in some kind of trouble?</i>

01:22:40.388 --> 01:22:41.989
Maybe not.

01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:49.129
I'm glad you're back.

01:22:49.131 --> 01:22:52.967
I didn't think
you were coming back
after my mini meltdown.

01:22:55.837 --> 01:22:58.973
You're allowed
to have a meltdown.

01:22:58.975 --> 01:23:02.276
Of course
i was coming back.

01:23:02.278 --> 01:23:05.079
How else was I gonna be
able to give you this?

01:23:07.482 --> 01:23:09.650
What did you have to do
to get all this?

01:23:09.652 --> 01:23:11.385
You don't wanna know.

01:23:11.387 --> 01:23:12.686
Actually, I do.

01:23:14.723 --> 01:23:18.892
Okay.
I'll tell you everything.

01:23:18.894 --> 01:23:22.196
Because...
Because the police

01:23:22.198 --> 01:23:26.433
are probably going
to come here and take me away.

01:23:26.435 --> 01:23:29.103
So, umm...
What?

01:23:29.105 --> 01:23:32.172
But I want you
to know that...

01:23:36.044 --> 01:23:39.780
I don't care anymore
about ducks being in a row.

01:23:41.282 --> 01:23:43.017
I don't.

01:23:43.019 --> 01:23:45.419
Ducks be damned.

01:23:45.421 --> 01:23:49.089
As long as I have you
and our daughter...

01:23:50.225 --> 01:23:52.526
Ducks can go
fuck themselves.

01:23:52.528 --> 01:23:55.896
I don't think that
would be a good idea.

01:23:55.898 --> 01:23:59.033
Then there'd just be
more to take care of.

01:24:00.502 --> 01:24:03.971
Is that...
Is that a siren?

01:24:03.973 --> 01:24:07.207
No. That is
the John Lennon mobile

01:24:07.209 --> 01:24:08.709
I attached to the crib.

01:24:10.045 --> 01:24:12.780
I assembled it myself...

01:24:12.782 --> 01:24:15.549
And a few other things.

01:25:00.462 --> 01:25:03.764
Isn't this that Volvo
we were lookin' for.

01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:11.205
It is that Volvo
we were lookin' for.

01:25:11.207 --> 01:25:15.342
Motherfucker's behind
on like, six payments.

01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:19.780
Let's go repo that shit.

01:25:19.782 --> 01:25:21.715
Yeah.
Yeah.
