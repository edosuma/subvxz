03:19.700 --> 03:23.403
George Atwood, Sir, from
"The Times" of London.

03:23.938 --> 03:26.372
I looked in at the shop.
They said I'd find you here.

03:29.243 --> 03:31.244
There was another Atwood at your newspaper.

03:31.246 --> 03:33.346
Yes, my Father.

03:33.348 --> 03:34.948
And to his last breath he
told anyone who'd listen

03:34.950 --> 03:36.749
about the "grand old man of golf."

03:49.797 --> 03:52.232
I see you're still looking
after the course.

03:52.234 --> 03:54.500
Do you, uh, do you ever get out to play?

03:54.502 --> 03:56.603
Aye.

03:56.605 --> 03:58.271
I can barely hit it out my own shadow.

03:58.273 --> 04:01.574
That's the modest old Tom
my Father wrote about.

04:03.510 --> 04:06.012
You are the founder of
the open championship.

04:06.014 --> 04:07.814
Four-time winner of the challenge belt.

04:07.816 --> 04:11.484
Why, if not for you, what would
have become of the game of golf?

04:11.486 --> 04:12.484
Listen.

04:12.486 --> 04:15.521
I don't know what kind of article
you've come here to write...

04:16.357 --> 04:18.690
But if it's about the
"Grand old Man of Golf,"

04:18.692 --> 04:20.860
- then you can think again.
- I'm sorry, I...

04:20.862 --> 04:22.662
There's only one story you'll get from me.

04:27.301 --> 04:29.369
<i>A story about a boy</i>

04:29.371 --> 04:32.438
<i>who carried a cut down Golf Club
I made for him, everywhere.</i>

04:33.440 --> 04:35.808
<i>A boy who thought he could
beat every golfer in Scotland.</i>

04:36.510 --> 04:38.845
<i>A boy who slept like a paving stone.</i>

04:38.847 --> 04:40.480
Tommy.

04:41.448 --> 04:42.582
Tommy!

04:46.587 --> 04:47.820
Up!

04:48.756 --> 04:50.657
Far and sure, son.

04:51.659 --> 04:53.426
Far and sure.

05:25.693 --> 05:27.393
There's far for you.

05:36.603 --> 05:39.005
Downward strike, son. Sharp as you can.

05:46.046 --> 05:47.847
Nice shot. Come on.

05:54.621 --> 05:56.656
Tom Morris. Master Greenkeeper.

05:58.792 --> 06:01.594
That young lad of yours
is growing like a weed.

06:01.596 --> 06:03.796
He'll make a fine caddy one day.

06:03.798 --> 06:05.365
Thank you, Sir.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.138
I'd putt that.

06:22.516 --> 06:24.016
Gambler's spirit.

06:24.018 --> 06:25.918
Duly noted.

06:41.869 --> 06:43.870
Good game, son. Well played.

06:43.872 --> 06:46.873
- Come now, Tom.
- You've got work to do.

06:46.875 --> 06:48.808
Get the scorecards.

06:48.810 --> 06:50.410
Come on, Lang Dan.

06:57.985 --> 07:00.820
You'll be giving the captain a
lesson after these men come in.

07:05.827 --> 07:08.428
Give me my club, Lang Dan.

07:18.472 --> 07:20.039
Play away, Sir.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.821
Direction-wise...

07:34.823 --> 07:37.457
Perfect drive, Sir.

08:13.895 --> 08:20.766
Jamie, if I can't read your writing, how
do you expect your schoolmaster to?

08:20.768 --> 08:22.568
I can read it.

08:22.570 --> 08:25.037
Tell us about the train that
goes under the ground, Tommy.

08:26.174 --> 08:29.609
A wonder of the world it is, Jackie.

08:29.611 --> 08:32.178
10,000 men dug a tunnel under London.

08:32.179 --> 08:35.014
500 men lost their lives.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.716
And down in this tunnel,

08:36.717 --> 08:38.183
right under everyone's feet,

08:38.186 --> 08:41.854
a thousand lanterns light
the way for a train

08:41.856 --> 08:44.891
that goes as fast as a cannonball!

08:44.893 --> 08:45.925
- Come on!
- Ah!

08:45.927 --> 08:47.193
Choo-choo!

08:49.197 --> 08:52.765
Thomas Morris junior, put the
child down before you injure him.

08:53.634 --> 08:57.036
You're to help your brother with his
schooling and set a Christian example.

08:57.038 --> 08:59.105
You're not to be gallivanting about.

08:59.806 --> 09:00.973
Yes, mum.

09:00.975 --> 09:02.808
Back to your lessons now.

09:12.052 --> 09:15.054
There shall be no fun in
this house, children.

09:43.717 --> 09:46.786
Lovely to see you this fine day, Mrs.
Morris.

09:46.788 --> 09:50.089
It would be no fit sabbath
without your sermon to guide us.

09:50.091 --> 09:53.025
Oh, your children are a testament

09:53.027 --> 09:54.627
to the standards you've set, Madam.

10:02.636 --> 10:04.303
That was Beethoven.

10:04.305 --> 10:07.106
I remember my first piano
lesson like it was yesterday.

10:07.108 --> 10:10.042
I've also had singing lessons
since I was five years old.

10:10.044 --> 10:12.278
Straight away, the teacher
said I had perfect pitch.

10:13.347 --> 10:15.214
Do you know what that is, Tommy?

10:15.216 --> 10:16.816
Perfect pitch?

10:29.096 --> 10:31.330
That was a crap shot.

10:31.332 --> 10:33.633
- You've already had your crap shot.
- Clearly you can have more...

10:33.635 --> 10:34.934
And that was your last one two shots ago.

10:34.936 --> 10:37.770
- What took you so long?
- Oh, I was kidnapped.

10:37.772 --> 10:40.072
Tortured with Beethoven and cake.

10:40.074 --> 10:43.042
Did you pray for us in church today, Tommy?

10:43.044 --> 10:46.045
Indeed I did not. Two of
you are past salvation.

10:46.047 --> 10:47.813
Oh, here, speaking of sin.

10:47.815 --> 10:50.216
Davie enjoyed a fine romance last night.

10:50.218 --> 10:53.019
- Aye, or so he claims.
- Hey, there's no claiming about it.

10:53.021 --> 10:56.188
Her name was prudence.
Thankfully she had none.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.058
A rut iron.

10:59.060 --> 11:00.960
It's a good club for killing snakes.

11:00.962 --> 11:03.763
Found a better use for it.

11:03.765 --> 11:06.065
Pick your coins up, boys,
they'll be mine presently.

11:06.933 --> 11:08.334
- Yeah?
- Huh?

11:08.969 --> 11:11.203
- Aye.
- I won that round, Jamie.

11:11.205 --> 11:14.373
Not a chance, man.

11:15.409 --> 11:17.109
Are you daft?

11:17.878 --> 11:20.179
That's no rut iron shot.
You need a Mashie.

11:21.314 --> 11:23.015
Not anymore you don't.

11:40.133 --> 11:43.436
- Whoa, wait, what did I just see?
- All right, it hit a rock.

11:43.438 --> 11:46.472
- Penny says I can do it again.
- Yeah, all right, I'll take that wager.

11:46.474 --> 11:48.307
Aye, so will I.

12:00.754 --> 12:02.888
Right, what was that?

12:03.824 --> 12:06.726
This can do more than just
pick balls out ruts, boys.

12:06.728 --> 12:09.161
You bring the club down hard
on the back of the ball

12:09.163 --> 12:12.398
and it'll spin like a top, front to back.

12:12.400 --> 12:14.266
I call it backspin.

12:14.268 --> 12:15.868
Pay up.

12:15.870 --> 12:16.936
Come on.

12:23.510 --> 12:26.178
Her ladyship inquires as to
the hour of your return.

12:27.047 --> 12:28.514
Day is over when the war is won.

12:28.516 --> 12:30.816
'S at war with the gorse bushes, Tommy.

12:30.818 --> 12:33.419
Oh, aye. And the dunes no doubt,

12:33.421 --> 12:36.856
and the rain and the goats and the rabbits.

12:36.858 --> 12:39.458
- I fear I'm outnumbered.
- Yeah, Dad, I was thinking...

12:40.794 --> 12:43.028
You got a teeing ground
at the first hole, right?

12:43.030 --> 12:45.865
Well, why don't we put
one next to every green?

12:45.867 --> 12:47.399
The way you've got it now
we've got Golfers out there

12:47.401 --> 12:49.168
tearing our Greens up every day.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.471
Eh, it's not a bad idea.

12:53.173 --> 12:56.175
But who am I to fiddle
with a 500-year-old game?

12:56.177 --> 12:57.910
There are 13 rules to golf.

12:57.912 --> 13:01.046
The first one, you must tee the ball...

13:01.048 --> 13:04.283
Within a club length of the hole.
Even I know that.

13:04.285 --> 13:08.487
- And rules written 100 years ago.
- Aye, and you'll not be changing them.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.249
Leave the rules of golf to
the steering committee.

13:15.229 --> 13:18.130
Men of the Morris persuasion,
good day to you.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.467
Well, afternoon, captain.

13:22.569 --> 13:24.103
Niblick's as good as new.

13:24.105 --> 13:25.938
Ah, good, good.

13:27.340 --> 13:28.407
Hmm.

13:28.409 --> 13:33.379
I trust you'll be, uh, caddying for
me at the spring meeting, Tom?

13:33.381 --> 13:36.048
It would be a pleasure, Sir, but, uh,

13:36.050 --> 13:38.984
Colonel Fairlie's already
arranged for my services.

13:40.187 --> 13:42.021
Oh, I see.

13:42.023 --> 13:44.223
Well, perhaps, young Tommy
could do the honors.

13:44.225 --> 13:46.091
That's a very generous offer, Sir.

13:48.028 --> 13:50.229
I don't know, Sir.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.103
<i>Well, Tom...</i>

13:58.105 --> 14:01.974
I've been considering betting
on you for the match next week.

14:01.976 --> 14:04.543
But your last outing against Willie park...

14:05.512 --> 14:07.613
You cost me 60 pounds.

14:08.448 --> 14:09.915
Sorry, Sir.

14:11.218 --> 14:13.552
Well, it's not the money I'm worried about.

14:13.554 --> 14:17.056
It's, uh, it's my reputation...

14:17.058 --> 14:19.258
My standing in the eyes of the town.

14:19.260 --> 14:20.459
Understand, Sir.

14:20.461 --> 14:25.497
And your putting, god knows,
it's worse than my own.

14:26.132 --> 14:29.368
Perhaps you might like to let
your sons make the gutties

14:29.370 --> 14:33.038
and you get out and practice.

14:33.506 --> 14:34.640
Thank you, Sir.

14:36.343 --> 14:37.610
Practice.

14:41.515 --> 14:46.318
That man is a captain in the club.
How could you insult him?

14:46.320 --> 14:48.888
Why'd you let him talk
to you like that, Dad?

14:48.890 --> 14:50.422
Because he has every right to.

14:50.424 --> 14:52.424
I work for him and the other gentlemen.

14:52.426 --> 14:54.460
Yeah, you do, but I don't.

14:54.462 --> 14:58.330
A caddy's son you are
and a caddy you'll be.

14:58.332 --> 15:00.966
- Yeah, we'll see.
- What else would you be doing?

15:00.968 --> 15:02.935
Well, I'll be a golfer.

15:02.937 --> 15:05.404
Aye, a golf professional?

15:06.406 --> 15:09.275
Who gives lessons? Who makes golf balls?

15:09.277 --> 15:10.575
Who makes Golf Clubs?

15:10.577 --> 15:13.045
Who caddies for gentlemen and
treats them with respect?

15:13.047 --> 15:15.114
No, that's yourself you're
talking about, Dad.

15:19.519 --> 15:22.454
And have you thought about how
you're going to make a living, boy?

16:01.394 --> 16:04.263
Twelve... 13...

16:04.731 --> 16:07.266
The lad's ready.

16:07.268 --> 16:09.001
Why is he not your playing partner?

16:09.003 --> 16:11.170
He's just 15, Sir.

16:12.272 --> 16:14.640
We've been betting on
you for years now, Tom.

16:16.276 --> 16:20.145
And when you've won, we put a
pretty penny in your pocket.

16:20.147 --> 16:22.348
And I'm grateful to you and
to the other gentlemen.

16:24.517 --> 16:28.120
But in all fairness to us, Tom,

16:28.122 --> 16:31.023
your performance has fallen off.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.359
What you say, Sir, is...

16:34.361 --> 16:35.661
It's a hard reckoning.

16:37.230 --> 16:38.530
And a fair one.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.200
Look here,

16:41.202 --> 16:42.668
your backers want to win,

16:42.670 --> 16:45.604
you have debts, your lad's ready.

16:45.606 --> 16:48.340
In one stroke you solve the problem.

16:49.676 --> 16:52.411
I thank you for your
good counsel, Mr. Kinloch.

16:54.414 --> 16:56.715
- If I may?
- Of course. You have work to do.

16:58.551 --> 16:59.752
Tom?

17:01.421 --> 17:04.690
A man's got to use every club he has.

17:04.692 --> 17:08.060
Twenty for the winner.

17:09.396 --> 17:10.762
A Sterling debut, lad.

17:11.798 --> 17:15.200
Two Thomas Morris' are
certainly better than one.

17:15.202 --> 17:16.435
Thank you, Sir.

17:17.940 --> 17:19.138
Don't worry, Willie.

17:19.140 --> 17:22.407
I'm sure the park brothers will
live to fight another day.

17:22.410 --> 17:24.276
Beginner's luck I call it.

17:24.278 --> 17:26.444
Your pup's still got his milk teeth.

17:26.446 --> 17:28.714
We can always go round again
if you thought it was luck.

17:28.716 --> 17:30.516
I'll see you in Musselburgh, laddie.

17:30.518 --> 17:31.916
The capital of golf.

17:31.918 --> 17:34.620
Aye, pride in one's town.
It's a fine thing, Willie.

17:34.622 --> 17:36.388
It's a fine thing. Come on, son.

17:39.592 --> 17:42.194
So says the man who's won his last open.

17:42.196 --> 17:44.263
Here.

17:44.265 --> 17:46.365
Five pounds?

17:46.367 --> 17:49.501
- Is that all you're giving me?
- Be still. That's your share.

17:49.503 --> 17:51.570
Now get in there, and don't be
telling your mother your winnings.

17:51.572 --> 17:52.638
Give.

18:17.564 --> 18:19.865
Did you see that? Hole-in-one.

18:22.102 --> 18:24.103
Come on! Whoo-hoo!

18:27.774 --> 18:30.676
Just try your arms by your
side there, young Mr. Morris.

18:33.113 --> 18:34.780
Best just hold it, then.

18:39.352 --> 18:41.186
And hold still.

19:13.821 --> 19:15.754
Well done, Tommy.

19:16.422 --> 19:18.390
Congratulations. Well done.

19:18.392 --> 19:19.825
Thank you. Give me a drink.

19:19.827 --> 19:21.493
Come on.

19:23.396 --> 19:25.264
Congratulations are in order.

19:25.266 --> 19:27.232
George Atwood of "the times" of London.

19:27.234 --> 19:30.536
London, really?
Nice to meet you, George.

19:30.538 --> 19:33.605
No one's ever won the
open by such a margin.

19:33.607 --> 19:36.508
David Strath finished
second 12 strokes behind.

19:36.510 --> 19:39.344
Truth is, I let my friend win.
I'm a nobleman at heart.

19:39.346 --> 19:41.547
Oh, aye, but a commoner on the links, too.

19:41.549 --> 19:44.249
And what will you play for now, Tommy?

19:44.851 --> 19:46.952
Money, glory...

19:47.620 --> 19:49.721
Fun.

19:52.592 --> 19:54.593
It's been eight years,

19:54.595 --> 19:57.396
since Colonel Fairlie and
the Earl of Eglinton

19:57.398 --> 20:00.432
asked me to organize the
first open championships.

20:00.434 --> 20:02.234
The Prestwick Club

20:02.236 --> 20:04.603
donated a fine Moroccan leather belt

20:04.605 --> 20:06.305
as a trophy.

20:06.307 --> 20:08.941
And we declared first champion

20:08.943 --> 20:11.243
would hold that belt for one year

20:11.245 --> 20:12.778
before passing it on to his successor.

20:12.780 --> 20:14.947
We also declared that should any man

20:14.949 --> 20:17.482
win that belt three years in a row,

20:17.484 --> 20:20.552
that man would keep that
belt in perpetuity.

20:20.554 --> 20:22.754
A bit of trickery, that was.

20:22.756 --> 20:24.690
After all, who could do such a thing?

20:24.692 --> 20:27.793
Not you, Tom Morris. Two wins
in a row was your limit.

20:30.930 --> 20:33.732
Aye, aye. Aye it was, it was.

20:34.634 --> 20:37.502
I am very, very proud to say

20:37.504 --> 20:40.239
that the ultimate winner of this prize,

20:40.241 --> 20:42.608
of that belt...

20:42.610 --> 20:45.244
Is my very own son,

20:45.246 --> 20:47.279
Thomas Morris, junior.

21:11.704 --> 21:15.340
Well... the game is catching on in England.

21:15.775 --> 21:18.010
We have a fine course in Liverpool now.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.345
In Devonshire, westward ho has adopted

21:20.347 --> 21:22.681
the St. Andrew standard of 18 holes.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.784
And Blackheath...

21:25.786 --> 21:27.719
My home club...

21:27.721 --> 21:29.588
Is prepared to take the lead.

21:30.490 --> 21:32.357
We want to be the center

21:32.359 --> 21:33.759
of golf in England.

21:34.527 --> 21:36.895
Perhaps in all the empire.

21:37.864 --> 21:40.866
- Will there be anything else, Sir?
- Thank you, no.

21:40.868 --> 21:43.769
Do you know that your serving port
to the champion golfer of Scotland?

21:44.771 --> 21:46.270
Oh, just Scotland?

21:46.272 --> 21:49.975
Aye, well, it's the only place with
Golfers of any account, eh, Major?

21:49.977 --> 21:52.611
I hear they play the game in England now,

21:52.613 --> 21:54.613
Liverpool, Devonshire.

21:54.615 --> 21:56.682
That'll be all, miss.

22:00.453 --> 22:01.953
I'm prepared...

22:02.755 --> 22:05.390
To offer you a position.

22:06.559 --> 22:07.793
Position?

22:10.496 --> 22:12.564
Tell me this, Tommy...

22:13.333 --> 22:14.633
What's your future here?

22:15.668 --> 22:16.968
Work in your Father's shop?

22:16.970 --> 22:19.705
And one day, rest his soul,

22:19.707 --> 22:21.773
it's your shop.

22:22.775 --> 22:24.509
My work, Major,

22:24.511 --> 22:27.079
is emptying the pockets of crack
Golfers and their backers.

22:27.081 --> 22:28.347
That's all.

22:28.349 --> 22:29.614
- In Scotland?
- Yeah.

22:30.483 --> 22:32.451
And for every pound here...

22:33.720 --> 22:36.455
It'll be 100 pounds backing you in England.

22:37.523 --> 22:40.392
As the Professional Golfer at Blackheath...

22:40.394 --> 22:42.894
You will be a wealthy man.

22:56.542 --> 22:57.876
Oh, Davie, Davie, watch it!

23:02.983 --> 23:05.684
- Davie, come on. No, no, no.
- Aw, just...

23:05.686 --> 23:08.019
How's your Father gonna manage without you?

23:08.021 --> 23:10.956
He'll have to make more
putts that's for sure.

23:12.125 --> 23:14.693
Who will be partnering him
in his money matches?

23:14.695 --> 23:16.828
No, don't you be angling
for an opportunity.

23:16.830 --> 23:18.797
Eh, I'm just saying.

23:18.799 --> 23:21.800
I think I should make a steady
playing partner for old Tom.

23:21.802 --> 23:23.535
Davie, come on.

23:23.537 --> 23:26.671
Our boy's just about to go
away and conquer England here.

23:26.673 --> 23:28.874
- He is.
- Mm-hmm.

23:28.876 --> 23:30.041
He's going to England.

24:11.851 --> 24:13.885
I can smell the alcohol from here.

24:16.622 --> 24:18.757
May have had a pint...

24:18.759 --> 24:20.025
Or two.

24:21.994 --> 24:24.129
And where will you be keeping your belt?

24:24.797 --> 24:26.865
What do you mean?

24:26.867 --> 24:29.801
Did you accept Major Molesworth offer?

24:31.571 --> 24:34.039
Did you seriously think there
would be golf business

24:34.041 --> 24:36.107
in St. Andrews that I wouldn't know about?

24:37.477 --> 24:39.778
You had scallops and
steak for your luncheon.

24:39.780 --> 24:41.260
And you didn't even finish your plate.

24:45.151 --> 24:48.019
They've got grand plans at Blackheath, Dad.

24:48.021 --> 24:50.989
My Father was a Handloom Weaver.

24:51.891 --> 24:53.725
There was nine of us in two rooms.

24:53.727 --> 24:59.164
I barely had a whisker in my face when
I was apprentice to a golf ball maker.

24:59.166 --> 25:01.867
I worked 16 hours a day and
sent pennies home every month.

25:01.869 --> 25:03.768
- I know this.
- My Father...

25:05.137 --> 25:07.973
He earned less money in a year...

25:07.975 --> 25:11.142
Than you and I made in one match last week.

25:12.011 --> 25:14.880
I'll be sending money home,
Dad, just like you did.

25:14.882 --> 25:17.883
- I will.
- You work for your Father, Tommy.

25:17.885 --> 25:20.685
Working for another man, that's
an altogether different matter.

25:21.554 --> 25:23.855
What do you know of Molesworth? Hmm?

25:23.857 --> 25:25.724
What do you know of England?

25:26.926 --> 25:29.027
I know it'll pay me twice your salary.

25:32.565 --> 25:34.199
You think of nothing but yourself.

25:37.104 --> 25:39.738
I don't want to spend my days

25:39.740 --> 25:42.207
on my knees teeing up

25:42.209 --> 25:44.876
gentlemen who despise me

25:44.878 --> 25:47.279
who-who think they're better
than me, can you not see that?

25:47.281 --> 25:48.914
What do you think you'll
be doing at Blackheath?

25:48.916 --> 25:51.316
Making my own way!

26:05.932 --> 26:08.633
I would have lost more
than I would have won

26:08.635 --> 26:11.836
without you as my playing
partner these last few years.

26:15.875 --> 26:17.709
I could lose this house.

26:21.747 --> 26:23.748
Your place is here.

26:39.434 --> 26:40.333
Tom!

26:40.334 --> 26:43.301
Tom, the Weaver's son.

26:43.303 --> 26:45.704
Takes three putts and our Willie takes one.

26:45.706 --> 26:47.639
Tom, Tom the Weaver's son.

26:47.641 --> 26:49.374
Takes three putts and our Willie takes one.

26:50.109 --> 26:51.843
Aye, you're in Musselburgh now, old Tom.

26:51.845 --> 26:53.945
No place to tarry over a four-foot putt.

27:04.991 --> 27:07.292
Park brothers, one up.

27:27.114 --> 27:29.648
I'll give you boys a chance
to double your bets.

27:32.051 --> 27:35.387
'Cause we're giving Saint
Andrews a thrashing today.

28:01.347 --> 28:03.982
Tommy Morris.

28:03.984 --> 28:05.450
Go back to fire.

29:01.407 --> 29:04.008
Hey, I saw that.

29:04.010 --> 29:05.910
Put it back, you dog.

29:05.912 --> 29:07.846
I'll play it where lays.

29:07.848 --> 29:09.781
Why don't you hit it off
that one's forehead?

29:09.783 --> 29:11.249
Now, now, Kirky.

29:11.251 --> 29:13.818
We'll forgive them their trespasses.

29:13.820 --> 29:15.487
Here, Dad.

29:19.792 --> 29:21.292
Stand back. Let the man play.

29:21.294 --> 29:23.762
Bugger off, champion golfer of shite.

29:23.764 --> 29:25.997
He's trying to play a shot, you idiot!

29:31.337 --> 29:32.537
Tommy!

29:43.783 --> 29:45.083
Two Whiskeys, please.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.521
They're laughing at us.

29:49.523 --> 29:51.823
What did you expect,
cheers wherever you go?

29:52.825 --> 29:54.993
Musselburgh is Willie park's town.
How much?

29:54.995 --> 29:56.294
- A tuppence, please, Sir.
- Thank you.

29:56.296 --> 29:58.196
Thanks.

29:59.514 --> 30:00.833
This is unprecedented.

30:00.834 --> 30:06.271
The St. Andrews gentlemen will
lose their wages if you concede.

30:07.573 --> 30:09.240
Are you conceding the match?

30:09.242 --> 30:11.476
There will be no match
if we're not in it, Sir.

30:11.478 --> 30:14.078
That's not for you to say, Tom Morris.

30:21.053 --> 30:23.822
Go on.

30:32.565 --> 30:34.032
Come on!

30:50.216 --> 30:51.950
This is no golf.

30:55.287 --> 30:59.023
James, time for a pint?

30:59.025 --> 31:01.226
Aye, all right. That's ready to go.

31:03.495 --> 31:05.563
Is this a Thomas Morris, Jr. Original?

31:05.565 --> 31:07.398
Oh, no, that's one of Jamie's.

31:07.400 --> 31:09.434
These hands have far more
important work to do.

31:09.436 --> 31:11.269
What like breaking noses in Musselburgh?

31:11.271 --> 31:14.305
Only a couple. Walked away, though.

31:14.307 --> 31:15.907
"This is no golf."

31:15.909 --> 31:18.376
- Who took home the money?
- Well, not us.

31:18.378 --> 31:21.045
For all I know, the gentlemen
feathered their beds with it.

31:21.047 --> 31:22.614
So, what, you suggesting
I got the first pint?

31:22.616 --> 31:24.215
For starters, aye.

31:30.589 --> 31:33.291
You've got Mr. Campbell's
foursome in half an hour.

31:33.293 --> 31:35.460
He expects you to bring his new putter.

31:35.462 --> 31:36.527
I will.

31:38.664 --> 31:41.032
Does the Englishman's offer still stand?

31:41.034 --> 31:42.634
That's not the point.

31:42.636 --> 31:45.103
The point is, I should've
just gone without a word.

31:45.105 --> 31:47.338
Instead, I listened to my Dad again.

31:47.340 --> 31:49.073
Why do I keep doing that?

31:49.075 --> 31:51.142
Now I'm bound to just stay here
doing the same work as him

31:51.144 --> 31:52.543
on the same bloody patch of ground.

31:52.545 --> 31:54.412
I'm a shackled, man.

32:00.152 --> 32:02.253
See, when I have a son, right,

32:02.255 --> 32:04.656
I'm not gonna tie him down and
tell him what to do all the time.

32:04.658 --> 32:06.557
No, I'll let him choose his own path.

32:09.161 --> 32:11.963
You see, if he wants to be a
golfer, than he can be a golfer.

32:11.965 --> 32:14.265
But if he wants to sail to the orient,

32:14.267 --> 32:16.501
then Bon Voyage.

32:21.240 --> 32:23.141
Lift that pint without me.

32:31.583 --> 32:32.984
Hi, Tommy.

33:00.079 --> 33:01.479
What happened to you?

33:02.748 --> 33:04.415
Golf's a lot rougher than you think.

33:04.417 --> 33:07.051
I don't think about golf at all.

33:08.287 --> 33:09.988
You think about me?

33:11.256 --> 33:13.658
Listen to Mr. champion of Scotland.

33:13.660 --> 33:17.462
Oh, no, just a Greenkeeper's
son stands before you.

33:17.464 --> 33:20.131
Well, you're standing in my way.

33:23.302 --> 33:25.103
So, um...

33:25.105 --> 33:27.038
So, what time do you finish your work?

33:27.673 --> 33:29.574
How old are you, Tommy Morris?

33:29.576 --> 33:31.476
How old do you think I am?

33:32.678 --> 33:35.513
I'm 28 years old.

33:35.515 --> 33:37.548
Best find yourself a school girl.

33:42.521 --> 33:44.655
Do you know what I love most about golfing?

33:45.624 --> 33:48.559
No, there are times when
you've no hope of a shot,

33:48.561 --> 33:51.496
you've got no chance, it's
impossible, but you try it anyway.

33:52.364 --> 33:55.066
You put everything that
you've got into that shot.

33:55.068 --> 33:57.201
And then you just...

33:57.203 --> 33:58.636
You just see where it goes.

34:06.612 --> 34:08.713
Margaret's a lovely name.

34:08.715 --> 34:10.447
Meg, they call me.

34:11.516 --> 34:14.085
Can I walk you home,
Margaret-called-Meg?

34:14.087 --> 34:17.355
Short walk that would be. I
live just above the restaurant.

34:17.822 --> 34:19.757
Ah, Tommy.

34:20.759 --> 34:23.194
Do us proud in Perth next week.

34:23.196 --> 34:25.096
We're counting on a tidy profit.

34:25.098 --> 34:28.232
We know you can't lose as a single player.

34:28.234 --> 34:30.234
No disrespect to your Father.

34:31.170 --> 34:33.404
It's good to hear how
much you do respect him.

34:34.672 --> 34:36.239
Gentlemen.

34:42.447 --> 34:45.716
So, gentlemen pay you to play golf?

34:45.717 --> 34:48.186
After a fashion, yeah.

34:48.587 --> 34:50.554
They put the stakes up for a match.

34:50.556 --> 34:52.290
Hundreds of pounds, like.

34:52.292 --> 34:54.592
And gentlemen in every town back a golfer.

34:55.494 --> 34:57.161
When I win...

34:57.163 --> 34:59.330
My backers take the winnings,

34:59.332 --> 35:01.766
and they pay me as they choose,
there's no say in it, really.

35:03.168 --> 35:05.136
Hundreds of pounds?

35:05.138 --> 35:06.604
Oh, yeah.

35:11.844 --> 35:13.311
What's your fancy?

35:15.647 --> 35:18.149
These chocolates have come
all the way from Belgium.

35:18.151 --> 35:20.885
Of course you'd be talking up the
ones with the highest price.

35:20.887 --> 35:22.453
We'll take a dozen.

35:25.390 --> 35:27.325
Here you go, Ma'am.

35:27.327 --> 35:29.260
Sir.

35:33.732 --> 35:35.867
Well, she sounds a fiery one.

35:35.869 --> 35:37.168
No.

35:38.437 --> 35:40.538
I'm in love, boys.

35:40.540 --> 35:41.839
You're what?

35:41.841 --> 35:43.474
I'm telling you...

35:46.245 --> 35:48.379
I believe there's a cure for that.

35:48.714 --> 35:49.780
Come on.

35:55.521 --> 35:56.587
Stop making shit up.

36:03.829 --> 36:05.596
- All right?
- Aye.

36:10.235 --> 36:12.236
Hello, Davie.

36:12.238 --> 36:14.539
This way, lads,
I've what you're wanting.

36:14.541 --> 36:16.674
One of you waits.

36:16.676 --> 36:18.743
I run a respectable house.

36:18.745 --> 36:20.611
No.

36:20.613 --> 36:23.748
I would like to pay my
respects, please, Mrs.

36:24.316 --> 36:25.383
Aye.

36:25.884 --> 36:27.351
Why not?

36:34.927 --> 36:36.494
Won't be long now.

36:40.866 --> 36:43.634
Suit yourself.

38:44.857 --> 38:46.524
Go on, girl.

38:46.992 --> 38:48.792
You should be out there
with the rest of them.

38:49.861 --> 38:51.829
Thank you, Mr. Riggs.

38:51.831 --> 38:53.431
Not so fast.

39:34.906 --> 39:36.841
Can I see that club?

39:36.843 --> 39:39.443
Aye. He's a clever one, my player.

39:39.445 --> 39:40.743
These scratches, mate,

39:40.745 --> 39:43.114
they pull the water away so the
ball does the slippy slide.

39:46.551 --> 39:48.753
Well, you've got it won now, Mr. Kidd.

39:48.755 --> 39:50.454
I'll not catch you unless you drown.

39:50.456 --> 39:52.456
Ah, fortune was on my side today.

39:52.458 --> 39:54.525
No, you outplayed me, Tom.

39:54.527 --> 39:55.893
Well played.

40:04.770 --> 40:06.137
Ladies and gentlemen,

40:06.139 --> 40:09.840
the winner of the 1873 open championship,

40:09.842 --> 40:12.543
Mr. Tom Kidd.

40:29.694 --> 40:31.629
Jamie, come on, get up.

40:31.631 --> 40:33.697
Get the gloves.

40:37.135 --> 40:38.636
You stick them on, right.

40:39.504 --> 40:40.905
Right, outside, everyone.

40:59.524 --> 41:01.158
- Okay?
- Yeah.

41:01.160 --> 41:02.460
Right.

41:03.962 --> 41:06.063
You're getting far too
heavy to carry, Jackie.

41:08.533 --> 41:09.700
Happy Hogmanay.

41:11.637 --> 41:12.703
Ready?

41:12.705 --> 41:13.838
Run! I'll race you!

41:15.107 --> 41:17.675
Fine work we did on that chariot, Dad.

41:17.677 --> 41:20.110
No, I won't take credit for that, son.
It was all your idea.

41:25.884 --> 41:27.218
Sorry I'm late.

41:27.220 --> 41:29.487
It's all right.

41:31.490 --> 41:32.690
Happy new year.

42:06.925 --> 42:08.659
What will I win for sinking this?

42:08.661 --> 42:11.529
To the winner, a fine plump goose.

42:12.163 --> 42:13.731
A goose?

42:17.068 --> 42:18.936
What's the prize for second place?

42:18.938 --> 42:20.571
Bottle of Whisky.

42:25.277 --> 42:28.112
Oh, bugger.

42:39.758 --> 42:40.925
There you go, son.

42:44.764 --> 42:46.163
There we go, there we go, there...

42:46.165 --> 42:47.831
Right. Oh, oh...

42:47.833 --> 42:49.166
I... oh.

42:49.868 --> 42:51.702
There you go, Kirky.

42:52.637 --> 42:54.138
The dregs of my defeat.

42:56.107 --> 42:58.342
A toast to the house of Morris.

43:00.079 --> 43:02.913
It's my honor to caddy for
the finest Caddie master

43:02.915 --> 43:04.114
the old game will ever see.

43:04.116 --> 43:06.350
No man can fashion a better Golf Club.

43:06.352 --> 43:08.652
No other could have tamed these links

43:08.654 --> 43:11.055
and made our home course
the Jewel of Scotland.

43:11.057 --> 43:13.257
And none but old Tom can claim to be

43:13.259 --> 43:15.826
the Father of the greatest
golfer of them all,

43:15.828 --> 43:16.894
Tommy Morris!

43:16.896 --> 43:18.028
Tommy!

43:30.308 --> 43:31.742
Shh, here they come.

43:32.677 --> 43:35.279
Lizzie, I can't believe
you brought us here.

43:35.281 --> 43:37.948
Meg needs to know your
darkest secrets, Tommy.

43:40.051 --> 43:42.953
Tommy, how lovely.

43:42.955 --> 43:45.289
Yes, a lovely spot for the
girl to come fetch her brother

43:45.291 --> 43:47.257
- when Father's going to tan his hide.

43:47.259 --> 43:49.393
Always the wicked one were you?

43:49.395 --> 43:52.162
He'd sit by this tree thinking
no one would find him.

43:52.164 --> 43:53.964
Aye, you know, your Tommy
was the only one of us

43:53.966 --> 43:56.100
ever tried to climb clean to the top.

43:56.102 --> 43:57.301
Right little monkey he was.

44:03.274 --> 44:04.842
Get off. What is that?

44:04.844 --> 44:06.276
What is that? What is that?

44:06.278 --> 44:09.146
What do you mean? It's a monkey.
It's a monkey.

44:10.315 --> 44:12.750
Such Bonny Stitchwork.

44:13.184 --> 44:15.119
I'm hopeless with a needle.

44:15.121 --> 44:16.387
Ten thumbs.

44:16.389 --> 44:17.988
I'll teach you lace-making.

44:17.990 --> 44:19.790
- You made that?
- Aye.

44:19.792 --> 44:21.759
A gentleman's wife in
Edinburgh gave me work.

44:23.762 --> 44:26.482
Has Tommy told you about the plot
he's hatched for the money matches?

44:27.298 --> 44:29.166
If there's plotting afoot, I'm in.

44:29.934 --> 44:32.002
Why are we giving all the
riches to the rich, Davie?

44:32.004 --> 44:33.203
It makes no sense.

44:34.406 --> 44:36.774
The rich have riches.

44:36.776 --> 44:38.442
It's nothing to do with us.

44:38.444 --> 44:41.045
Yeah, but it does if they're
betting on you and me.

44:41.047 --> 44:42.379
Perhaps this can wait.

44:42.381 --> 44:46.050
Some matters are best left... Unannounced.

44:49.020 --> 44:50.954
I'm starving. Is there any more food?

44:50.956 --> 44:52.823
Here take that.

44:52.825 --> 44:54.058
Do you want some?

44:56.728 --> 44:58.362
<i>The post is here, Sir.</i>

44:58.364 --> 44:59.362
<i>Good.</i>

44:59.364 --> 45:02.032
<i>And Thomas Morris to see you, Sir.</i>

45:02.034 --> 45:03.767
<i>Which one?</i>

45:03.769 --> 45:05.402
<i>Thomas junior.</i>

45:05.404 --> 45:07.137
<i>He state his business?</i>

45:07.906 --> 45:09.740
<i>All he would say is</i>

45:09.742 --> 45:11.308
<i>"the rights of man."</i>

45:11.310 --> 45:13.711
<i>- Very well. Send him in.
- Sir.</i>

45:34.032 --> 45:36.734
Never seen a man play chess alone before.

45:37.969 --> 45:39.470
My opponent is a Cambridge don.

45:39.472 --> 45:41.505
He's a brilliant tactician.

45:42.207 --> 45:43.941
We play by mail, you see.

45:45.110 --> 45:46.877
With this morning's post,

45:46.879 --> 45:48.479
he lost a pawn.

45:49.514 --> 45:52.049
And he's about to lose another.

45:56.488 --> 45:58.822
What brings you to see me, young man?

45:58.824 --> 46:01.024
I wanna discuss the stakes
for the match tomorrow.

46:02.193 --> 46:04.361
Oh, I might have guessed.

46:05.330 --> 46:09.233
A young man's fancy turns
to thoughts of love...

46:09.235 --> 46:10.934
And money.

46:11.336 --> 46:14.071
We've always been very
generous with you, Tommy.

46:14.906 --> 46:16.774
More so than with your Father,

46:16.776 --> 46:18.008
as a matter of fact.

46:19.144 --> 46:21.178
But then you've always been...

46:21.180 --> 46:23.247
More valuable to us in some ways.

46:23.915 --> 46:26.350
My view of my value differs
from yours, captain.

46:27.018 --> 46:29.920
You see, Davie and I are the
ones playing the match.

46:30.421 --> 46:32.556
So we should be the ones
collecting on the stakes.

46:32.558 --> 46:35.559
Well, don't be ridiculous.

46:35.561 --> 46:37.828
It's time for a new arrangement, Sir.

46:37.830 --> 46:39.329
An arrangement?

46:41.065 --> 46:44.168
You are not my business partner.

46:44.170 --> 46:47.437
You have your role, and
we reward you for it.

46:47.439 --> 46:50.207
Just as we do with your
Father and the rest.

46:50.209 --> 46:52.376
If you want me to play
in the match tomorrow,

46:52.378 --> 46:55.212
then the money comes to me
before we begin, all of it.

46:55.214 --> 46:58.882
I'll take my fair share and
I'll give the rest back to you.

46:58.884 --> 47:01.418
Otherwise you can find
yourself another player.

47:03.822 --> 47:06.089
Your station in life was set

47:06.091 --> 47:08.492
before you were born, young Morris.

47:08.494 --> 47:11.361
Now, you've done well for
yourself, I'll Grant you that.

47:11.363 --> 47:14.198
But never think

47:14.200 --> 47:17.234
that putting on a gentleman's
suit makes you a gentleman.

47:17.236 --> 47:19.169
You come to my home

47:19.171 --> 47:22.105
with these outrageous demands.

47:22.907 --> 47:25.876
In your Father's time that would
have earned you a lashing.

47:25.878 --> 47:30.180
Be grateful. You prosper
thanks to men like me.

47:46.064 --> 47:48.498
The sheer nerve of the man.

47:48.500 --> 47:52.302
Next he'll expect to be
a member of the club.

47:54.038 --> 47:56.874
Greenkeeper's son acting as our equal.

47:57.475 --> 47:59.376
God forbid I should live to see it.

48:03.481 --> 48:05.148
Right, you're certain are you?

48:05.617 --> 48:07.251
- Yes.
- Right, then.

48:07.253 --> 48:08.919
Why don't you just wait right here?

48:09.356 --> 48:10.255
Yeah.

48:10.256 --> 48:13.457
- Yeah, that would make more sense.
- Right.

48:18.930 --> 48:19.997
Tommy.

48:20.398 --> 48:22.132
Thomas! Thomas.

48:23.268 --> 48:25.402
- Thomas Morris!
- Tommy.

48:26.938 --> 48:29.573
Tommy, you know I can't let you in here.

48:30.308 --> 48:32.242
Just pretend you never saw me, Bertie.

48:33.111 --> 48:34.611
You must leave at once!

48:35.213 --> 48:37.948
Right you are, Sir. Due at
the tee any minute now.

48:38.650 --> 48:42.085
Gentlemen, 'tis a grand
day for golf, is it not?

48:42.087 --> 48:43.654
This is too much!

48:44.522 --> 48:48.225
The clubhouse is for members,
Tommy, as you well know!

48:48.227 --> 48:50.427
Well, I'll not be long, captain.

49:21.993 --> 49:24.027
You will leave now.

49:26.264 --> 49:28.098
Give you a good show, gents.

49:44.649 --> 49:48.418
Davie Strath plays a
Stymie like an old woman.

49:48.420 --> 49:51.221
Golf champion Tommy Morris.

49:51.223 --> 49:52.990
He'd have blocked my
ball, too, if he could.

49:59.664 --> 50:02.132
No, you're all right, Tommy,
you can pick that up.

50:03.601 --> 50:05.736
- Such a gentleman.
- I know.

50:09.108 --> 50:10.640
I'm sorry, you want me to take this?

50:10.642 --> 50:12.109
Of course.

50:18.116 --> 50:20.017
The hole is halved.

50:20.019 --> 50:21.718
Davie Strath is two up.

50:39.570 --> 50:42.272
Say your prayers, young Tommy.

50:42.274 --> 50:45.075
My man's lying two. He's got you beat.

50:48.813 --> 50:51.248
I wish that fool would shut his yap.

50:51.250 --> 50:53.690
If all the fools fell silent,
this would be a very quiet town.

51:05.129 --> 51:07.431
Brilliant!

51:19.477 --> 51:21.278
And that's the gentleman's fair share.

51:26.284 --> 51:28.351
Fine thank you from Davie and I, gents.

51:29.153 --> 51:31.354
He bested me today, but I think
we gave you a good show.

51:34.192 --> 51:37.094
You're a hero, Tommy Morris, to this town.

51:38.196 --> 51:41.131
But a gentleman... You'll never be.

51:42.500 --> 51:44.401
Aye, well, times change, captain.

51:47.371 --> 51:48.805
Times change.

51:53.611 --> 51:55.245
Which one, which one, which one?

51:55.247 --> 51:57.581
- That one, please.
- Okay.

52:01.519 --> 52:03.320
Tommy Morris?

52:03.322 --> 52:06.490
Congratulations. I saw you play.
You were spectacular out there.

52:06.492 --> 52:07.891
Thanks very much. Thank you, thank you.

52:07.893 --> 52:09.693
- Did you come up last week?
- Yeah...

52:12.630 --> 52:13.897
I just wanted to say good luck.

52:13.899 --> 52:16.666
Well, thank you very much. Thanks.

52:44.596 --> 52:48.765
You shouldn't be wasting your
winnings on fancy dresses.

52:48.767 --> 52:50.433
What should I waste it on, then?

52:51.502 --> 52:52.602
Cake.

52:53.638 --> 52:54.838
Good idea.

52:56.541 --> 52:57.774
- Oh, sorry.
- Sorry.

52:58.843 --> 52:59.910
Milady.

53:10.688 --> 53:12.856
Old Mrs. Fraser wouldn't recognize me now.

53:14.725 --> 53:16.560
Oh, the lady that you worked for.

53:16.562 --> 53:17.794
Aye, lace-making.

53:19.630 --> 53:22.399
She slapped me once for
wearing a ribbon in my hair.

53:25.504 --> 53:29.206
If she saw you now, she'd
kill you outright.

53:37.281 --> 53:39.216
Why are you doing all this for me, Tommy?

53:41.385 --> 53:42.986
What do you mean? Because I want to.

53:42.988 --> 53:45.255
Because we're having fun, aren't we?

53:45.957 --> 53:48.391
That can lead to trouble for a woman.

53:49.560 --> 53:51.861
You're not like any woman I've ever met.

53:51.863 --> 53:53.663
You're only 22.

53:53.665 --> 53:54.931
I'm 23.

53:54.933 --> 53:56.233
Ah, well.

54:03.341 --> 54:04.941
What do you think of love, Margaret?

54:10.381 --> 54:11.815
Uh, I...

54:13.017 --> 54:15.485
Don't put much store by it.

54:32.570 --> 54:33.637
We're here.

54:53.291 --> 54:54.591
Address the ball, Tommy.

54:56.060 --> 54:58.495
Hold still, please.

55:02.566 --> 55:05.402
So will you be talking to Willie
park for your article, Mr. Atwood?

55:05.404 --> 55:07.070
In fact I'm not.

55:07.072 --> 55:09.339
Not Willie, not Tom Kidd,

55:09.341 --> 55:10.940
nor the other leading professionals.

55:12.743 --> 55:15.779
<i>No one in London cares a whit for
any golfer not named Thomas Morris.</i>

55:15.781 --> 55:16.979
<i>As well they shouldn't.</i>

55:16.981 --> 55:19.883
<i>And is it the old ancient history
of golf that they're after?</i>

55:20.618 --> 55:22.852
<i>Which case you should
probably speak to my Father.</i>

55:24.388 --> 55:26.089
<i>And my story's about the founding Father</i>

55:26.091 --> 55:27.991
<i>and son of the modern game.</i>

55:27.993 --> 55:31.628
<i>That makes a grander tale than
either Father and son alone.</i>

55:32.396 --> 55:34.064
<i>Let me ask you, Tom.</i>

55:34.066 --> 55:37.334
<i>Do you believe your son
inherited his talents from you,</i>

55:37.336 --> 55:39.803
<i>or did you teach him all he knows of golf?</i>

55:39.805 --> 55:42.038
I've taught him everything he knows.

55:43.341 --> 55:46.343
- But not everything that I know.

55:46.911 --> 55:48.578
Hold still.

55:55.453 --> 55:57.721
It's a mother's right to know these things.

55:58.622 --> 56:00.423
Surely you understand.

56:37.795 --> 56:39.796
Tommy, you can't beat him.

56:39.798 --> 56:41.765
He shoots it a mile.

56:41.767 --> 56:44.634
Be still, Jamie. I'll have him beat yet.

56:45.469 --> 56:47.036
It's not always about length.

56:47.038 --> 56:48.671
Sometimes it's accuracy.

56:50.141 --> 56:52.642
Here, I'll double our side bet.

56:53.177 --> 56:54.944
Gambling with a wild man.

56:54.946 --> 56:56.579
Aye, double it.

57:33.552 --> 57:36.753
Mum..

57:37.855 --> 57:39.022
Tommy gave me his winnings.

57:40.224 --> 57:42.892
It's no great honor beating
Robin hood, Jamie.

57:42.894 --> 57:44.160
Here, Dad.

57:48.065 --> 57:49.599
A golf quiver.

57:50.701 --> 57:52.702
Jamie, leave us.

57:52.704 --> 57:54.202
Go see what your sister's wanting.

57:54.204 --> 57:56.706
And most of that money will go
into the collection on Sunday.

57:56.708 --> 57:57.974
On your way.

57:59.210 --> 58:00.477
Aye, Father.

58:01.912 --> 58:03.646
Of course we'd make ours bigger

58:03.648 --> 58:05.915
for more clubs, like, but...

58:05.917 --> 58:07.183
Caddies would love you for it, Dad.

58:07.185 --> 58:08.685
What do you think?

58:08.687 --> 58:10.753
Your mother's been to Whitburn, Tommy.

58:12.523 --> 58:13.823
What's this about?

58:13.825 --> 58:17.827
That woman you're squiring
for the whole town to see.

58:18.529 --> 58:20.797
Do you know the first
thing about her Tommy?

58:20.799 --> 58:22.799
- Besides what you're wanting from her?
- Nancy.

58:22.801 --> 58:24.534
A Fornacatrix!

58:24.969 --> 58:27.270
This drinnen woman parading around!

58:27.272 --> 58:29.873
Named and shamed in her own church!

58:29.875 --> 58:32.642
I don't listen to church gossip, mum.

58:33.544 --> 58:34.944
'Tis not gossip.

58:36.180 --> 58:37.579
Your Margaret Drinnen,

58:37.581 --> 58:40.583
the scullery maid you've
pinned your heart to...

58:44.788 --> 58:47.023
Her minister showed me the ledger.

58:47.925 --> 58:50.293
She had a bastard child five years ago.

58:50.295 --> 58:52.929
All Whitburn knows what she is!

58:59.770 --> 59:02.572
You'll not see that woman again.

59:33.237 --> 59:35.038
- Meg?
- Tommy?

59:39.009 --> 59:40.243
Tommy.

59:43.113 --> 59:45.014
I don't care.

01:00:13.777 --> 01:00:16.279
Are you scared, Tommy? I'd be scared.

01:00:16.947 --> 01:00:18.681
Not a whit, Jackie boy.

01:00:18.683 --> 01:00:21.317
Not a whit. Come on.

01:00:34.632 --> 01:00:36.366
They're a family of princes.

01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:42.739
Without the king and queen, I see.

01:00:45.776 --> 01:00:49.212
"Give ear to my words, O lord,
consider my meditation.

01:00:50.014 --> 01:00:53.883
Harken unto the voice of my cry
for unto thee I will pray.

01:00:55.119 --> 01:00:58.054
My voice shalt thou hear in the morning.

01:00:58.056 --> 01:01:02.025
<i>O lord, in the morning will I
direct my prayer unto thee,</i>

01:01:02.027 --> 01:01:03.359
<i>and will look up."</i>

01:01:15.806 --> 01:01:17.106
For luck.

01:01:17.108 --> 01:01:19.375
Oh, you're all the luck I need.

01:01:26.884 --> 01:01:28.451
Dearly beloved,

01:01:28.453 --> 01:01:31.154
we're gathered here in the sight of god

01:01:31.156 --> 01:01:33.790
to join this man and
woman in holy matrimony.

01:01:34.458 --> 01:01:37.894
Marriage is ordained for the
procreation of children...

01:01:38.362 --> 01:01:42.131
To be brought up in the fear
and nurture of the lord.

01:01:42.133 --> 01:01:44.934
Will thou have this woman as thy wife?

01:01:44.936 --> 01:01:47.470
Will thy love, honor and keep her

01:01:47.472 --> 01:01:49.170
in sickness and in health

01:01:49.172 --> 01:01:52.709
forsaking all others, so
long as you both shall live?

01:01:52.711 --> 01:01:54.343
I will.

01:01:54.345 --> 01:01:56.446
And, Margaret,

01:01:56.448 --> 01:01:58.948
wilt thou have this man as thy husband?

01:01:58.950 --> 01:02:01.484
Will thy love, honor, and keep him

01:02:01.486 --> 01:02:03.286
in sickness and in health

01:02:03.288 --> 01:02:06.923
forsaking all others so long
as you both shall live?

01:02:06.925 --> 01:02:08.124
I will.

01:02:19.236 --> 01:02:21.971
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

01:02:21.973 --> 01:02:23.339
You may kiss the bride.

01:02:33.383 --> 01:02:34.450
Tommy!

01:02:39.289 --> 01:02:41.090
The last train leaves Carnoustie at seven.

01:02:41.092 --> 01:02:43.459
- Lizzie will be here to look in on you.

01:02:43.461 --> 01:02:47.764
I'm lucky to see her an hour a day
now that she has her new friend.

01:02:48.298 --> 01:02:49.899
And that woman.

01:02:50.534 --> 01:02:52.235
She's our daughter-in-law.

01:02:53.337 --> 01:02:56.139
Tommy loves her, Nancy. So must we.

01:03:07.117 --> 01:03:10.787
I'll not sell my home
to a mere golf player.

01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:12.355
I understand, Mr. Urquhart.

01:03:12.357 --> 01:03:15.224
But, you know, he's not
a "mere golf player."

01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:18.394
His name is known from London to Calcutta.

01:03:18.396 --> 01:03:19.394
Aye.

01:03:19.396 --> 01:03:23.432
'Tis the name of the head of the
caddies at the golf course.

01:03:23.434 --> 01:03:26.102
'Tis the name of a golf shop.

01:03:26.104 --> 01:03:29.172
- You are speaking of his Father.
- One and the same.

01:03:29.174 --> 01:03:30.840
I understand.

01:03:35.345 --> 01:03:36.979
Have you not heard me, man?

01:03:36.981 --> 01:03:40.216
This may be worthy of your attention.

01:03:54.064 --> 01:03:56.432
We'll put a putting green
on the rise over there.

01:03:56.434 --> 01:03:58.534
It's good to keep the golfer
looking toward heaven.

01:03:58.536 --> 01:04:02.205
A bunker here for the over-ambitious.

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:06.175
Wise men like yourselves will
make a prudent shot to here,

01:04:06.177 --> 01:04:08.978
then it's one, two shots to the hole.

01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:10.179
- You got that, son?
- Aye.

01:04:10.181 --> 01:04:11.480
Okay.

01:04:12.149 --> 01:04:13.583
And does young Tommy Morris

01:04:13.585 --> 01:04:16.052
design golf courses?

01:04:16.054 --> 01:04:18.387
Tommy's no interest in
designing courses, Sir.

01:04:18.389 --> 01:04:20.489
He's only interested in conquering them.

01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:28.197
Gentlemen and ladies on
such a convivial afternoon.

01:04:28.199 --> 01:04:31.500
Mr. Reginald white will represent
Blackheath in this contest.

01:04:31.502 --> 01:04:35.538
And representing St. Andrews, the
champion golfer of Scotland,

01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:37.173
Tom Morris, junior.

01:04:49.319 --> 01:04:51.587
I never saw so many bonny Lasses.

01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:53.522
How long can we stay in London?

01:04:54.658 --> 01:04:57.493
Oh, not long. I'll have
this boy beat in no time.

01:04:59.663 --> 01:05:01.530
All the best, Sir, aye.

01:05:21.385 --> 01:05:24.120
My lady Margaret.

01:05:24.122 --> 01:05:26.222
She knows we're to start at half eight.

01:05:26.224 --> 01:05:28.224
Aye, well, we've got all night.

01:05:28.226 --> 01:05:29.325
Hmm?

01:05:29.327 --> 01:05:31.160
And then we can have our night.

01:05:32.362 --> 01:05:34.297
Don't paw at me, Tommy.

01:05:34.299 --> 01:05:36.499
I'll not have my appearance ruined as well.

01:05:41.406 --> 01:05:44.006
Well... here we go.

01:05:46.977 --> 01:05:49.145
Hello. Come in, come in, come in.

01:05:49.147 --> 01:05:50.546
Happy Hogmanay.

01:05:50.548 --> 01:05:51.948
Go straight through,
go straight through.

01:05:51.950 --> 01:05:54.150
- Happy Hogmanay, Tommy.
- You, too. I know.

01:05:54.152 --> 01:05:55.584
All right, boys. Happy Hogmanay.

01:05:55.586 --> 01:05:56.384
Go on.

01:05:56.686 --> 01:05:57.720
- Straight through.
- Happy Hogmanay.

01:05:57.722 --> 01:05:58.988
Good to see you.

01:05:58.990 --> 01:06:00.256
Happy Hogmanay.

01:06:00.258 --> 01:06:02.692
Look at this house.

01:06:02.694 --> 01:06:05.027
- Happy Hogmanay, son.
- Thank you for coming, Dad.

01:06:06.463 --> 01:06:08.397
Nancy sends her best.

01:06:08.399 --> 01:06:10.166
This weather's awful hard on her.

01:06:10.168 --> 01:06:13.035
She'll not be dining with us
this evening, I'm afraid.

01:06:15.472 --> 01:06:17.239
I'm sorry to hear it.

01:06:46.737 --> 01:06:49.438
Do you know I left St. Andrews
after you spoke to my mum?

01:06:51.742 --> 01:06:53.009
No?

01:06:53.343 --> 01:06:54.543
Well, I did.

01:06:55.379 --> 01:06:57.046
I give up my job.

01:06:57.048 --> 01:06:58.748
A good job it was.

01:06:59.316 --> 01:07:03.019
I had no place to go. I
went back to Whitburn.

01:07:05.088 --> 01:07:07.556
Your Tommy came looking for me.

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:12.695
Young men look for things.

01:07:12.697 --> 01:07:14.497
I'm not a thing!

01:07:15.165 --> 01:07:17.299
I'm your son's wife.

01:07:17.301 --> 01:07:20.236
I'm Mrs. Thomas Morris just as you are,

01:07:20.238 --> 01:07:22.038
and I'll thank you to remember it.

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:24.774
I was his mother before you were his wife.

01:07:24.776 --> 01:07:27.109
Yes! You brought him into this world!

01:07:27.111 --> 01:07:28.209
Hallelujah! You raised...

01:07:28.211 --> 01:07:30.112
You have no right to speak to me like this!

01:07:30.114 --> 01:07:32.148
I have the same rights as any wife.

01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:33.783
But none of a mother!

01:07:47.364 --> 01:07:49.165
It was a girl.

01:07:51.668 --> 01:07:53.402
Did they tell you?

01:07:56.339 --> 01:07:58.140
My child...

01:08:01.611 --> 01:08:03.479
There was very little life in her.

01:08:05.248 --> 01:08:07.650
She lasted three short weeks.

01:08:12.689 --> 01:08:15.391
And many a day I wish her fate was my own.

01:08:24.634 --> 01:08:26.335
Tommy chose me.

01:08:27.571 --> 01:08:28.770
Do you understand?

01:08:30.573 --> 01:08:33.609
You might think otherwise, plenty do.

01:08:35.779 --> 01:08:37.846
I know what people think of me.

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:42.818
I'll not be running off again.

01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:15.184
I don't know why you load yourself with
that much gravy and then not eat it.

01:09:15.185 --> 01:09:17.752
I find that very wasteful.

01:09:45.881 --> 01:09:47.850
It's a lovely holiday you've made.

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:51.787
Thank you.

01:09:52.756 --> 01:09:54.623
We'll have many more.

01:09:56.193 --> 01:09:57.526
Yes...

01:09:58.528 --> 01:09:59.728
We will.

01:10:11.274 --> 01:10:12.708
Davie and I have been thinking.

01:10:14.311 --> 01:10:16.212
We stage our own matches.

01:10:16.846 --> 01:10:19.582
That way we can play any
course, in any town.

01:10:19.584 --> 01:10:22.551
And if they haven't a pair of
crack Golfers to play against us,

01:10:22.553 --> 01:10:24.486
we play singles, me versus Tommy.

01:10:24.488 --> 01:10:26.755
- Just like we did for the gentlemen.
- Aye, exactly.

01:10:27.557 --> 01:10:30.426
So let's just say we start at Prestwick.

01:10:30.428 --> 01:10:31.493
We take their money.

01:10:31.495 --> 01:10:34.230
Aye, obviously.

01:10:34.232 --> 01:10:36.665
And then off we go on tour.

01:10:36.667 --> 01:10:40.269
Perth, Musselburgh, north Berwick.

01:10:40.271 --> 01:10:43.772
In a month, we've made our way
as far down as Newcastle,

01:10:43.774 --> 01:10:47.276
Hoylake, even Blackheath.

01:10:47.677 --> 01:10:50.412
Then we just come back off our
tour with pockets full of pounds.

01:10:50.414 --> 01:10:52.281
Buccaneers with golf sticks.

01:10:53.483 --> 01:10:56.485
- I'll drink to that.
- Aye, to the buccaneers.

01:10:56.487 --> 01:10:59.888
- To the buccaneers.
- Buccaneers.

01:11:02.892 --> 01:11:04.760
"Golf-o-mania" they're calling it.

01:11:04.762 --> 01:11:07.596
At Blackheath, they even held a
tournament for lady Golfers.

01:11:07.598 --> 01:11:09.398
Don't their bosoms get in the way?

01:11:09.766 --> 01:11:12.534
Well, judging by their
scores, perhaps they do.

01:11:13.570 --> 01:11:15.437
I should like to meet the
one who came in last.

01:11:16.273 --> 01:11:18.340
Well, perhaps she might
need a new Caddie, Davie.

01:11:18.342 --> 01:11:19.742
Yeah, perhaps she does.

01:11:19.744 --> 01:11:22.511
Have you heard Major
Molesworth's latest claim?

01:11:22.513 --> 01:11:24.747
He's declared that he and his
son can beat any two men

01:11:24.749 --> 01:11:26.515
willing to take them on.

01:11:26.517 --> 01:11:28.317
This man's mad.

01:11:28.319 --> 01:11:31.620
Um, there's a method to his
madness, or so it seems.

01:11:31.622 --> 01:11:34.590
He's set on making Blackheath a
show place to rival St. Andrews.

01:11:34.592 --> 01:11:36.458
George, did you really come
all the way from London

01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:38.294
just to talk about this Englishman?

01:11:38.296 --> 01:11:39.494
Not at all.

01:11:39.496 --> 01:11:42.531
I came to talk with the two
Golfers I hear cannot be beat.

01:11:42.533 --> 01:11:44.566
That's more like it.

01:11:45.835 --> 01:11:47.303
What are you knitting there?

01:11:54.078 --> 01:11:56.945
Secret-keeper.

01:11:57.681 --> 01:11:59.448
How far gone are ya?

01:11:59.749 --> 01:12:01.717
About three months, I reckon.

01:12:02.986 --> 01:12:05.854
- Who else knows?
- Only Tommy.

01:12:08.024 --> 01:12:10.059
Now you.

01:12:14.699 --> 01:12:16.432
You think your mum will like me better now?

01:12:21.104 --> 01:12:22.905
Come on. Come on, Davie, come on!

01:12:25.409 --> 01:12:26.508
Come on.

01:12:32.949 --> 01:12:35.851
Come on!

01:12:44.861 --> 01:12:47.863
<i>Plain country minister...</i>

01:12:48.932 --> 01:12:51.033
Stands humbly before you.

01:12:51.035 --> 01:12:54.470
A minister who knows the role

01:12:54.472 --> 01:12:56.805
he is to play in god's world.

01:12:58.608 --> 01:13:00.843
And I ask... do you?

01:13:00.845 --> 01:13:03.379
Acceptance of one's destiny.

01:13:04.647 --> 01:13:07.850
Humility before god and man.

01:13:07.852 --> 01:13:10.452
Did not our lord

01:13:10.454 --> 01:13:13.655
renounce all possessions seeking
only to follow the path

01:13:13.657 --> 01:13:16.058
his Father set before him?

01:13:16.593 --> 01:13:18.127
Not for him

01:13:18.129 --> 01:13:20.462
to grasp at worldly advancement.

01:13:20.464 --> 01:13:22.798
Yet some among us do grasp.

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:26.101
Some think to rise above their station.

01:13:27.404 --> 01:13:29.004
Seeking glory.

01:13:29.706 --> 01:13:31.407
Seeking status.

01:13:31.875 --> 01:13:34.576
I'll not listen to this.

01:13:34.578 --> 01:13:35.778
Come, Meg.

01:13:49.893 --> 01:13:53.762
Worldly desires cannot change the plans

01:13:53.764 --> 01:13:56.432
our lord has for us!

01:14:01.871 --> 01:14:04.940
It's the north Berwick town
council that's invited us.

01:14:04.942 --> 01:14:06.608
Put up 1,000 pounds.

01:14:06.610 --> 01:14:09.912
The town council? But they don't
have a player in the match.

01:14:09.914 --> 01:14:10.712
No.

01:14:10.714 --> 01:14:12.981
But they reckon people are
gonna come from all over,

01:14:12.983 --> 01:14:14.783
you know, holiday-makers

01:14:14.785 --> 01:14:16.783
just to watch the great Tommy Morris

01:14:16.785 --> 01:14:19.822
and capable Davie Strath beat
the tar out the park brothers.

01:14:24.195 --> 01:14:25.094
You're joking?

01:14:25.095 --> 01:14:28.997
Yeah, Archie Croyle threw
me out last night, he did.

01:14:28.999 --> 01:14:30.997
And you know I'm his best customer, so...

01:14:30.999 --> 01:14:33.202
Well, the cross keys pub's no
place for a respectable man.

01:14:34.037 --> 01:14:35.604
Look...

01:14:35.606 --> 01:14:37.206
Doctor says it's broke.

01:14:37.208 --> 01:14:40.108
- I won't lift a club for a month.
- Oh, Davie.

01:14:40.110 --> 01:14:42.478
Davie, they're never
gonna put the match off.

01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:44.780
Well, they'll have to, won't they?

01:14:44.782 --> 01:14:45.914
Sally.

01:14:47.050 --> 01:14:48.250
Come, David.

01:14:50.687 --> 01:14:51.753
Yeah.

01:15:07.704 --> 01:15:10.172
He hasn't won a money match in a dog's age.

01:15:12.242 --> 01:15:14.543
I'd be better off playing with Jamie.

01:15:14.545 --> 01:15:16.745
You did right, my love.

01:15:18.815 --> 01:15:22.050
The way he putts, though, you'd
think he'd had his eyes closed.

01:15:24.787 --> 01:15:27.556
He's so proud to be your Father, Tommy.

01:15:29.025 --> 01:15:30.626
Being there with you.

01:15:30.628 --> 01:15:34.630
How many more chances is he gonna
have to be your golf partner?

01:15:37.066 --> 01:15:38.600
Don't wanna leave you, though.

01:15:40.036 --> 01:15:41.303
Don't be daft.

01:15:41.305 --> 01:15:45.841
Lizzie will be here fussing over me.
The girl practically lives here.

01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:48.176
Go with your Dad.

01:15:48.878 --> 01:15:50.012
And win.

01:15:51.748 --> 01:15:53.248
If you say so.

01:15:55.919 --> 01:15:57.920
Your mother is a very clever woman.

01:15:59.022 --> 01:16:00.822
So I suggest you stay here as well.

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:04.693
"Grand match in north Berwick."

01:16:05.029 --> 01:16:09.264
"All eyes turn to the links for
the upcoming match between Willie

01:16:09.266 --> 01:16:11.266
and Mungo park of Musselburgh

01:16:11.268 --> 01:16:14.570
- and the Morrises of St.
- Andrews."

01:16:14.572 --> 01:16:17.806
"Unprecedented sums ride upon the outcome.

01:16:17.808 --> 01:16:20.008
The park brothers are...

01:16:20.010 --> 01:16:21.777
Favored to prevail"?

01:16:21.779 --> 01:16:23.219
- What?
- What a load of shite.

01:16:26.064 --> 01:16:27.083
Don't worry, Dad.

01:16:27.084 --> 01:16:31.153
Just give those putts a good
spanking and we'll be all right.

01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:36.959
Now each side is to play a single ball

01:16:36.961 --> 01:16:38.660
alternating shots.

01:16:40.196 --> 01:16:42.297
Park brothers have the honor.

01:16:42.299 --> 01:16:44.299
Play away, gentlemen.

01:16:45.335 --> 01:16:46.969
Come on, Willie.

01:16:47.804 --> 01:16:50.072
Come on, Willie.

01:17:17.934 --> 01:17:19.067
Go, Tommy.

01:17:22.372 --> 01:17:23.639
Come on, Tommy.

01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:02.844
Straight in the hole, Mungo.

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:12.054
Don't worry, brother.

01:18:12.922 --> 01:18:15.023
We know who's holding their putter.

01:18:23.266 --> 01:18:25.033
It's our day, Dad! Come on!

01:18:26.069 --> 01:18:28.203
Morrises are one up.

01:18:39.015 --> 01:18:41.283
Here it is.

01:18:48.057 --> 01:18:50.125
We can do it in two, son.
Just get it near the green.

01:18:50.127 --> 01:18:51.827
No, I can get it from here, Dad.

01:19:09.979 --> 01:19:11.246
Give me the chipper.

01:19:47.150 --> 01:19:49.251
Sure you got your line
right there, old Tom?

01:19:50.887 --> 01:19:53.255
Looks a wee bit off to me.

01:20:14.411 --> 01:20:16.845
Here, stop this! Stop this!

01:20:16.847 --> 01:20:19.014
Stop this at once!

01:20:20.850 --> 01:20:24.286
Play is suspended until
order can be restored!

01:20:24.288 --> 01:20:26.021
Stop it! Do you hear me?!

01:20:26.023 --> 01:20:28.256
Stop it right now. Andy?

01:20:28.258 --> 01:20:29.991
- Yes, Sir?
- Get a rope right away.

01:20:29.993 --> 01:20:31.159
- We'll rope them in.
- Yes, Sir.

01:20:31.161 --> 01:20:32.360
Now, that's enough of that.

01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:37.399
Thomas Morris?

01:20:38.467 --> 01:20:39.968
Thomas Morris?

01:20:42.538 --> 01:20:43.839
Aye, son.

01:20:48.244 --> 01:20:49.477
Telegram, Sir.

01:21:14.971 --> 01:21:16.872
Excuse me, Sir. I got the rope, Sir.

01:21:16.874 --> 01:21:19.040
Oh, that's my man. That's
exactly what I'm after.

01:21:22.078 --> 01:21:23.144
Golfers!

01:21:24.013 --> 01:21:25.280
Follow me!

01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:29.150
Tommy.

01:21:52.575 --> 01:21:54.342
Well done, Mungo!

01:21:54.344 --> 01:21:57.579
- Yes!
- Park brothers one up.

01:22:23.005 --> 01:22:25.240
The match is all-square

01:22:25.242 --> 01:22:27.475
with one hole to play.

01:22:59.675 --> 01:23:01.176
Come on!

01:23:40.349 --> 01:23:42.217
I hereby declare...

01:23:43.219 --> 01:23:45.186
That the Morrises of St. Andrews

01:23:45.188 --> 01:23:47.222
have beaten the parks of Musselburgh

01:23:47.224 --> 01:23:49.557
by one hole at the last.

01:23:51.260 --> 01:23:53.795
When's the next train back to St. Andrews?
I have to get back now.

01:23:53.797 --> 01:23:57.032
The next train's at four o'clock.
You'd be better off taking the boat.

01:23:57.034 --> 01:23:59.434
It'll take hours off your journey.
I'll get Lewis to take you.

01:23:59.436 --> 01:24:00.434
- Lewis!
- Aye.

01:24:00.436 --> 01:24:02.570
Would you take young Tommy
and Tom up to St. Andrews?

01:24:02.572 --> 01:24:05.540
- He has to get back.
- Aye, the boat's ready to go.

01:24:05.542 --> 01:24:07.175
Come on. Thank you.

01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:14.249
Tom Morris, I have your winnings here, Sir.

01:24:14.251 --> 01:24:15.750
- Thank you.
- Many congratulations

01:24:15.752 --> 01:24:17.585
on your victory today.

01:24:20.523 --> 01:24:23.124
Cold water.

01:24:27.630 --> 01:24:29.464
Lift your leg.

01:24:32.468 --> 01:24:35.070
That's a girl.

01:24:37.073 --> 01:24:38.273
That's it.

01:24:54.090 --> 01:24:56.191
Why did you not give it to me?

01:24:57.159 --> 01:24:59.227
We only had three holes left to play.

01:24:59.229 --> 01:25:01.362
But it was sent to me, not you.

01:25:02.431 --> 01:25:04.232
You have no business keeping it from me.

01:25:04.234 --> 01:25:06.701
I didn't want to burden you with it.

01:25:07.570 --> 01:25:10.171
, I'm not a child anymore.

01:25:10.173 --> 01:25:12.674
Can you not see that?
I'm a married man now.

01:25:12.676 --> 01:25:14.542
You can't just keep
making decisions for me.

01:25:14.544 --> 01:25:16.711
I don't need you to do that anymore.

01:25:18.514 --> 01:25:20.281
We had to finish the match.

01:25:20.850 --> 01:25:22.283
No, we didn't.

01:25:22.651 --> 01:25:24.619
No we didn't, Dad. No.

01:25:24.621 --> 01:25:27.322
There is no shame to forfeit
if you can't play on.

01:25:27.324 --> 01:25:28.422
Did you not tell me that?

01:25:28.424 --> 01:25:30.158
Is that not one of the many golden rules

01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:31.593
that you drummed into me since I was a boy?

01:25:31.595 --> 01:25:33.461
- We were winning.
- Nah.

01:25:33.463 --> 01:25:37.132
No you were having a good game, Dad, and
you don't have many of them anymore.

01:25:39.135 --> 01:25:41.302
Golf is your god, Dad, it's not mine.

01:25:51.714 --> 01:25:54.415
I shall need towels and ice water.

01:26:05.628 --> 01:26:07.595
You'll need to keep her temperature down.

01:26:11.934 --> 01:26:13.401
Shh.

01:26:21.944 --> 01:26:24.679
- He'll be here soon, lass.
- Where is he?

01:26:25.714 --> 01:26:29.250
I've never known Tommy Morris to be late.

01:26:29.852 --> 01:26:31.051
He's coming soon.

01:26:31.053 --> 01:26:33.488
We sent him a telegram.
He'll be on the next train.

01:26:33.490 --> 01:26:35.557
Can you get Tommy for me?

01:26:39.828 --> 01:26:41.496
Please, get Tommy.

01:26:43.899 --> 01:26:45.400
That's a good lass.

01:26:46.635 --> 01:26:47.835
Is he here?

01:26:49.872 --> 01:26:52.674
Ladies, you must leave the room.

01:26:54.743 --> 01:26:55.810
Now.

01:26:57.947 --> 01:26:59.847
Lizzie, we must do as he asks.

01:27:01.884 --> 01:27:02.951
Tommy?

01:27:03.519 --> 01:27:04.752
Tommy!

01:27:05.521 --> 01:27:07.322
Tommy!

01:27:41.457 --> 01:27:43.324
<i>Margaret?</i>

01:27:43.326 --> 01:27:45.827
<i>Margaret?!</i>

01:27:47.630 --> 01:27:49.297
It was a boy, Tommy.

01:27:49.299 --> 01:27:50.798
Your Margaret put up a Valiant effort.

01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:52.567
God rest her soul,

01:27:52.569 --> 01:27:53.968
and the child's.

01:28:01.310 --> 01:28:03.745
Margaret.

01:28:04.980 --> 01:28:06.381
Margaret.

01:28:12.788 --> 01:28:15.757
Margaret. Margaret. Margaret.

01:28:19.862 --> 01:28:21.596
Margaret.

01:28:23.666 --> 01:28:25.900
No, Margaret.

01:31:32.654 --> 01:31:33.721
Come on!

01:31:39.127 --> 01:31:40.828
Lie!

01:31:40.830 --> 01:31:42.530
Lie down!

01:31:42.898 --> 01:31:44.565
Lie down!

01:32:15.297 --> 01:32:16.998
You out for a walk?

01:32:19.902 --> 01:32:21.769
Just what you need to
build up your strength.

01:32:23.171 --> 01:32:24.272
So they say.

01:32:29.578 --> 01:32:31.746
Have you heard the noise
the Englishman's making?

01:32:31.748 --> 01:32:34.215
Aye. Old Molesworth's at it again.

01:32:34.217 --> 01:32:36.651
He's putting his son up against
all the best professionals.

01:32:37.219 --> 01:32:39.620
He makes sure he gets
plenty of strokes going in.

01:32:39.622 --> 01:32:41.923
Willie park spotted him four shots

01:32:41.925 --> 01:32:44.058
and then Willie lost.

01:32:44.060 --> 01:32:47.094
Molesworth's handicapping that
boy like a pony in a race.

01:32:48.897 --> 01:32:51.098
Now he's issued an official challenge.

01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:53.067
It's in all the newspapers.

01:32:54.036 --> 01:32:56.904
They've got the crackpot idea
the laddie can beat you, Tommy.

01:33:12.857 --> 01:33:14.056
If young Arthur here

01:33:14.057 --> 01:33:19.226
was to play the illustrious Tommy
Morris on his home links, no less,

01:33:19.228 --> 01:33:21.929
well... in all fairness...

01:33:21.931 --> 01:33:25.933
Four strokes... Not be sufficient.

01:33:26.702 --> 01:33:29.904
Now, Major, as I'm sure you can understand,

01:33:29.906 --> 01:33:32.840
there are other elements to consider.

01:33:32.842 --> 01:33:35.977
Circumstances that can
affect a man's abilities.

01:33:36.878 --> 01:33:39.046
Arthur here took four
strokes off Willie park.

01:33:39.048 --> 01:33:40.748
Look what happened to him.

01:33:40.750 --> 01:33:42.350
Ah, yes, but...

01:33:42.352 --> 01:33:45.820
Let's not forget we're discussing

01:33:45.822 --> 01:33:48.723
a plucky amateur in competition with

01:33:48.725 --> 01:33:51.025
a four-time open champion.

01:33:51.027 --> 01:33:52.693
A spectacle.

01:33:52.695 --> 01:33:54.962
It will be a match to
remember for years to come.

01:33:57.366 --> 01:33:58.966
Will you play, Tommy?

01:33:58.968 --> 01:34:01.068
We'd all go out to see you win.

01:34:01.070 --> 01:34:02.937
Thank you for your thoughts, miss.

01:34:02.939 --> 01:34:04.739
- Sir.
- That'll be all.

01:34:06.375 --> 01:34:07.642
Women.

01:34:19.888 --> 01:34:23.391
- I'll play.
- Ha! A toast.

01:34:31.033 --> 01:34:33.367
Tommy! Come on, you're late, man. Come on.

01:34:34.269 --> 01:34:35.436
Tommy!

01:34:43.211 --> 01:34:44.779
Tommy, wake up, lad.

01:34:46.114 --> 01:34:47.214
Can't see him.

01:34:51.154 --> 01:34:52.720
- Davie.
- What?

01:34:56.324 --> 01:34:57.825
Tommy, come on.

01:34:57.827 --> 01:34:59.360
Tommy, come on, lad. Up you get.

01:34:59.362 --> 01:35:01.128
Come on. Help get him up. Come on.

01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:03.297
Up you get, Tommy. Come on.

01:35:03.299 --> 01:35:05.032
Come on, lad.

01:35:05.034 --> 01:35:06.901
- Up you go.
- Tommy.

01:35:06.903 --> 01:35:08.069
Come on.

01:35:08.071 --> 01:35:10.004
Eh, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.

01:35:11.339 --> 01:35:12.973
Tommy! Tommy, Tommy.

01:35:13.241 --> 01:35:14.442
There you go.

01:35:14.444 --> 01:35:16.210
Tommy, there you are, boy.

01:35:17.245 --> 01:35:18.446
Where's my clubs?

01:35:19.214 --> 01:35:20.381
All right.

01:35:25.454 --> 01:35:27.755
- Get that down you.
- No, I'm fine, Davie.

01:35:27.757 --> 01:35:29.423
- Yeah, go on.
- No, I'm fine.

01:35:31.793 --> 01:35:33.360
- Are you all right, Tommy?
- Aye.

01:35:34.763 --> 01:35:35.830
Yeah?

01:35:36.098 --> 01:35:37.398
Good morning.

01:35:39.067 --> 01:35:41.402
This is the last day of our contest.

01:35:41.404 --> 01:35:44.972
Mr. Arthur Molesworth leads by one hole

01:35:44.974 --> 01:35:47.341
with these 18 left to play.

01:35:47.343 --> 01:35:50.945
Mr. Molesworth has the honor. Play away.

01:36:43.198 --> 01:36:44.932
He swings like a Lassie.

01:36:45.901 --> 01:36:49.303
I tried talking to that fancy
britches Caddie of his.

01:36:49.305 --> 01:36:51.338
Looked at me like I was a red Indian.

01:36:54.810 --> 01:36:58.145
What's he carrying ten clubs for?
No man needs more than seven.

01:37:00.015 --> 01:37:02.082
Davie, how's our boy fairing?

01:37:02.084 --> 01:37:03.884
We're one up.

01:37:03.886 --> 01:37:06.053
Oh, one up.

01:37:06.955 --> 01:37:08.022
Here.

01:37:53.335 --> 01:37:55.269
Course is unplayable.

01:37:55.271 --> 01:37:58.205
Match is suspended until
conditions improve.

01:37:59.274 --> 01:38:01.075
You're in my way.

01:38:03.511 --> 01:38:05.145
Look, Tommy, maybe your Dad's right.

01:38:05.147 --> 01:38:07.181
Let's just go inside and
sit by the fire, eh?

01:38:08.216 --> 01:38:10.216
Wouldn't be like you to
stop a match now, would it?

01:38:11.086 --> 01:38:13.621
Take heed, all.

01:38:14.489 --> 01:38:17.224
If a player retires from the course,

01:38:17.226 --> 01:38:18.926
he forfeits the match.

01:38:18.928 --> 01:38:20.561
I'm the keeper of these links.

01:38:21.930 --> 01:38:24.031
And I say the weather wins.
Play is suspended.

01:38:31.473 --> 01:38:33.507
The wager stands.

01:38:40.382 --> 01:38:41.982
Molesworth one up.

01:39:21.056 --> 01:39:22.323
Here, son.

01:39:23.058 --> 01:39:24.124
Son.

01:39:24.492 --> 01:39:25.693
This will warm your hands.

01:39:33.401 --> 01:39:34.702
Thank you.

01:40:21.217 --> 01:40:22.683
Oh, no, no. Not now, not now.

01:40:24.519 --> 01:40:25.786
Tommy.

01:40:26.788 --> 01:40:28.255
Tommy.

01:40:29.491 --> 01:40:31.358
Tommy.

01:40:33.496 --> 01:40:36.630
It's all right, Tommy. Come on, Tommy.

01:40:44.739 --> 01:40:46.740
Not too late for a side bet, Charles.

01:40:46.742 --> 01:40:50.110
Oh, you're the bold man now, are you?

01:40:50.112 --> 01:40:53.180
- Now the ride has turned.
- Oh, come on, be a sport.

01:40:53.648 --> 01:40:56.050
There's nothing better than
all-square on the last hole.

01:40:57.052 --> 01:40:58.585
Winning is better.

01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:07.494
I would suggest, uh...

01:41:07.496 --> 01:41:08.796
Stymie him.

01:41:16.371 --> 01:41:18.272
Come on.

01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:20.107
Coward.

01:42:27.208 --> 01:42:29.810
Did you see the look on
the English goose, Tommy?

01:42:29.812 --> 01:42:30.910
You plucked him good.

01:42:30.912 --> 01:42:33.347
Aye, that last shot could
be your best one ever.

01:42:33.349 --> 01:42:35.716
By the best golfer ever.

01:42:35.718 --> 01:42:38.418
Tommy, Major Molesworth's come to see you.

01:42:44.559 --> 01:42:47.227
I must apologize for the hour.

01:42:47.795 --> 01:42:50.397
I've brought a gift for the champion.

01:42:50.399 --> 01:42:51.465
Thank you.

01:42:52.901 --> 01:42:54.434
Was...

01:42:56.237 --> 01:42:57.671
A match for the ages.

01:42:59.374 --> 01:43:00.941
A brave victory.

01:43:00.943 --> 01:43:02.709
For your next winter battle.

01:43:08.483 --> 01:43:09.816
I'll show you out, Sir.

01:43:23.632 --> 01:43:26.433
- Don't touch it. It's Tommy's.
- I'm not hurting it.

01:43:26.435 --> 01:43:28.368
It's late. You two, bed.

01:43:43.685 --> 01:43:46.453
You surprised us with your
final shot today, son.

01:43:47.288 --> 01:43:48.855
A rut iron on the putting green.

01:43:49.657 --> 01:43:52.359
You'll have every golfer
in Scotland trying it,

01:43:52.361 --> 01:43:53.827
destroying my Greens.

01:43:55.964 --> 01:43:57.731
Maybe we'll...

01:43:57.733 --> 01:43:59.266
Make a new iron club.

01:44:00.401 --> 01:44:01.868
A for the green.

01:44:03.638 --> 01:44:05.772
With a flat bottom so you...

01:44:05.774 --> 01:44:08.475
Lift the ball without tearing the turf.

01:44:17.752 --> 01:44:19.253
I'm here, son.

01:44:20.021 --> 01:44:21.622
I forgive you, Dad.

01:45:32.794 --> 01:45:34.761
They say he died of a broken heart.

01:45:36.431 --> 01:45:39.499
I leave that kind of talk to those
with a fanciful turn of mind.

01:45:40.868 --> 01:45:44.071
Poets. Fortune tellers. Your like.

01:45:48.643 --> 01:45:50.977
I'm the last one, Mr. Atwood.

01:45:54.415 --> 01:45:56.683
You see how strong he is?

01:45:59.087 --> 01:46:01.788
Could hit the ball further than anybody.

01:46:01.790 --> 01:46:04.991
No mean feat given the
cudgels we made back then.

01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:10.797
It's a handsome memorial.

01:46:12.066 --> 01:46:13.900
And an honor to you as well.

01:46:17.605 --> 01:46:19.673
Hmm...

01:46:27.482 --> 01:46:29.783
<i>The truth is he was better than I.</i>

01:46:30.651 --> 01:46:32.419
<i>He was better than all of us.</i>
