11:24.392 --> 11:27.144
has started to jack
his little ding-a-ling.

11:27.228 --> 11:29.730
And your mama has found
his stained jockeys

11:29.814 --> 11:31.065
in some very odd places.

11:31.065 --> 11:33.275
Mm-hmm,
I think he's embarrassed.

11:34.693 --> 11:36.070
I--I don't understand.

11:36.070 --> 11:39.240
What's confusing?
He's blasting come everywhere.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.367
And your mom found
his damn undergarments

11:41.367 --> 11:42.576
hidden every which way
but loose.

11:42.660 --> 11:45.621
She found a pair
of his crusty child chones

11:45.621 --> 11:47.039
in the living room bible.
- Mm.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.249
And then found another pair

11:48.249 --> 11:49.417
stuffed in the back
of the freezer

11:49.417 --> 11:50.584
where the Dreamsicles are.

11:50.668 --> 11:51.794
I had two of those yesterday.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.671
We all enjoy the Dreamsicles.

11:53.671 --> 11:55.131
The little dude is up
in his room

11:55.131 --> 11:57.091
fuckin' blasting shit
behind his headboard.

11:57.091 --> 11:59.468
Sitting there blasting one
underneath his little kid desk.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.346
your mom and I
are not comfortable

12:02.430 --> 12:04.473
talking about come
with your baby brother.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.183
- Mm-hmm.
- Load-blow convos

12:06.267 --> 12:07.643
are more appropriate,
we believe,

12:07.643 --> 12:09.145
coming from an older sibling

12:09.145 --> 12:10.980
as opposed to mommies
and daddies.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.773
What am I supposed to say?

12:12.857 --> 12:13.983
I don't know.

12:13.983 --> 12:16.110
Tell him to knock it off.

12:16.110 --> 12:18.237
Tell him to put it
in a damn napkin and flush it

12:18.237 --> 12:19.613
like a normal person.
- Yes.

12:19.697 --> 12:21.490
Don't be field micing
this shit around the house.

12:21.574 --> 12:22.491
It's disrespectful.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.785
Okay.
I--I--I'll...feel it out.

12:24.869 --> 12:26.495
Try to bring it up organically.

12:26.579 --> 12:27.955
- Thank you.
- Of course.

12:27.955 --> 12:29.123
I got faith in you.

12:29.123 --> 12:30.499
- Yeah.
- Okay.

12:30.583 --> 12:31.584
Bye, guys.
- Hey, hey!

12:31.584 --> 12:33.586
- Hey.
- Fucking love you, homie.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.171
- Love you too.
- And I was just playing

12:35.171 --> 12:37.131
when I said that Granddaddy Roy

12:37.131 --> 12:38.507
pooped and peed
all over the floors.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.301
- Okay.
- He didn't do that.

12:40.301 --> 12:41.719
Just the master bedroom.

12:41.719 --> 12:43.512
I'll probably just move
into the guest bedroom

12:43.596 --> 12:44.972
knowing that about the master.

12:44.972 --> 12:46.599
- Yep, whatever you want.
- Okay.

all I do is I open my mouth

13:47.910 --> 13:49.370
and I let God do the rest.

13:49.370 --> 13:51.247
That's wonderful, Judy.

13:51.247 --> 13:52.873
That's the very best thing
to do.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.042
The book of Matthew...

13:56.377 --> 13:59.505
Tells of nation
rising against nation,

13:59.505 --> 14:00.923
kingdom against kingdom.

14:00.923 --> 14:03.926
A time of famines,
pestilence, and earthquakes.

14:03.926 --> 14:05.094
Sound familiar?

14:05.094 --> 14:07.596
In such scary, uncertain times,

14:07.680 --> 14:11.433
come diseases, financial ruin,
political turmoil.

14:11.517 --> 14:14.353
That's right, folks...
the works.

14:14.353 --> 14:17.648
Knowing that we could reach God...

14:17.648 --> 14:19.400
and he will answer.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.986
That's what we need right now!

14:21.986 --> 14:23.362
Amen.

14:23.362 --> 14:24.613
Well, hold on.
Wait a second, Daddy.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.991
Are you saying
people need Jesus's love

14:26.991 --> 14:28.117
now more than ever?

14:28.117 --> 14:29.326
Duh, my brother!

14:29.410 --> 14:31.870
We always need Jesus's love.

14:31.954 --> 14:34.248
But especially now.

14:34.248 --> 14:37.960
We do need Jesus' love
now more than ever.

14:37.960 --> 14:41.880
We are introducing
a streaming platform

14:41.964 --> 14:44.633
where you can access
Christian programming

14:44.717 --> 14:49.555
24/7 unlimited
whenever you need it.

14:49.555 --> 14:53.267
We call this service GODD,

14:53.267 --> 14:56.312
Gemstone on Digital Demand!

14:56.312 --> 14:57.813
Whoo!

14:57.813 --> 14:59.607
With the launch
of G-O-Double D,

14:59.607 --> 15:02.109
the Gemstones
have officially entered

15:02.109 --> 15:04.028
the streaming wars.

15:04.028 --> 15:09.116
Available on smart TVs, Roku,
Android, and Apple devices.

15:09.116 --> 15:11.368
Son, you speaking robot?

15:11.452 --> 15:13.954
Can we get that in English

15:14.038 --> 15:15.372
for us older folks?

15:15.456 --> 15:17.625
Uh, Daddy,
I think what he's trying to say

15:17.625 --> 15:19.710
is you can watch it
just about anywhere.

15:19.710 --> 15:23.088
And it is time to finally
stop the constant flood

15:23.172 --> 15:25.716
of filth and propaganda
coming out of Hollywood.

15:25.716 --> 15:27.051
If they're gonna fill

15:27.051 --> 15:29.803
the airwaves 24/7
with that garbage,

15:29.887 --> 15:31.221
we gonna do the same thing.
- Mm-hmm.

15:31.305 --> 15:33.849
That calls for a celebration!

15:33.849 --> 15:36.143
Who wants to sing and rejoice?

15:36.143 --> 15:38.020
Streaming services.

on rolls here.

17:10.571 --> 17:12.030
Stick to the salad bar.

17:12.114 --> 17:15.409
Don't forget, we are
swimming laps after lunch,

17:15.409 --> 17:17.661
so eat light.

17:17.745 --> 17:20.956
We nourish our bodies
for His love.

17:23.417 --> 17:25.502
Cool.
- So cool.

17:26.879 --> 17:27.921
Excuse me, sir?

17:28.005 --> 17:29.089
What's up?

17:29.173 --> 17:31.008
Dismissed.

17:31.633 --> 17:33.677
Will you be dining
with the men and I?

17:33.761 --> 17:35.679
Of course not, Keefe.

17:35.763 --> 17:37.931
I'll be above you,
upstairs with the family.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.311
Shall I join you?

17:42.311 --> 17:44.480
Oh, not appropriate.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.690
Upstairs church lunch is only
for the family.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.275
See you upstairs, Kelvin.

17:49.818 --> 17:52.780
And... Daddy's
closest work acquaintances.

17:52.780 --> 17:53.822
That's okay.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.241
Hey,
do not take this personal.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.410
No matter
how many disciples we gather,

17:58.494 --> 18:00.537
you're still my number one.

18:00.621 --> 18:02.289
All right?
All right?

18:02.289 --> 18:04.374
Oh, let me tickle
them titty meats.

18:04.458 --> 18:06.502
See you inside.

18:06.502 --> 18:09.797
He said my--you--
I'll see you...inside.

18:11.173 --> 18:13.592
He tried to kill himself?

18:13.592 --> 18:15.177
Oh, that is horrible.

18:15.177 --> 18:17.262
I just can't believe there was
nothing you could do about it.

18:17.346 --> 18:18.305
I mean,
you couldn't just tell him

18:18.305 --> 18:19.723
that the Butterfields
were staying in?

18:19.807 --> 18:20.766
Nothing I could do.

18:20.766 --> 18:23.060
Damage had already been done.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.353
He made his bed.

18:24.353 --> 18:26.188
It sounds like a lot
of people made their way

18:26.188 --> 18:27.356
into his bed.

18:27.356 --> 18:29.316
Oh, ha-ha, Martin.

18:29.316 --> 18:31.235
That fucking reporter ruined
their whole life.

18:31.235 --> 18:32.486
Like, blew up their whole deal.

18:32.486 --> 18:33.821
I feel really sad for them.

18:33.821 --> 18:35.948
Don't let it distract you.

18:35.948 --> 18:38.116
I wanna make sure
everybody is here

18:38.200 --> 18:40.911
for the missionary seminar
next week.

18:40.911 --> 18:42.538
Well, Amber and myself

18:42.538 --> 18:44.122
will unfortunately
have to take a rain check.

18:44.206 --> 18:45.457
We have been invited

18:45.541 --> 18:47.501
to a formal sit-down
with the Lissons.

18:47.501 --> 18:48.752
The Lissons?

18:48.836 --> 18:50.546
The gorgeous preaching couple
from Texas?

18:50.546 --> 18:53.048
- Yeah.
- What for?

18:53.048 --> 18:54.424
What do you mean, "What for?"

18:54.508 --> 18:57.010
They're a successful
power Christian couple.

18:57.094 --> 18:58.887
As are my wife and I.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.681
Who knows what the hell
we can cook up together.

19:00.681 --> 19:02.850
Well, it's just weird
that they invited you

19:02.850 --> 19:03.934
and not anybody else.

19:03.934 --> 19:05.227
- Thank you.
- I mean, there's a lot

19:05.227 --> 19:06.770
of successful people
in this family.

19:06.854 --> 19:07.896
That's all I'm saying.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.857
If the Lissons
wanna open up a Gold's Gym,

19:09.857 --> 19:10.858
I'll tell 'em
to give you a call.

19:12.276 --> 19:13.819
I imagine we were invited

19:13.819 --> 19:17.990
'cause they probably realized,
as Daddy's faculties are...

19:17.990 --> 19:21.201
waning and he starts
getting older and tired-er--

19:21.285 --> 19:23.537
no offense, Daddy--
that Amber and myself

19:23.537 --> 19:25.539
are the logical next leaders.

19:25.539 --> 19:27.791
Y'all are not the only
married people in this family.

19:27.875 --> 19:31.169
Me and BJ are
also strongly betrothed

19:31.253 --> 19:32.880
and also crushing it.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.798
Not a real family.

19:34.882 --> 19:36.592
No kids.
- Ooh, ooh!

19:36.592 --> 19:38.010
Slam. I like that one.
- Mm-hmm.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.595
I don't got time for kids

19:39.595 --> 19:42.764
'cause I'm trying to keep
this fresh physique fine.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.933
I'm not trying to be
all loose and stretched out

19:45.017 --> 19:46.643
like Amber's
played-out pastrami.

19:46.727 --> 19:47.811
Could you please pass
the mustard?

19:47.895 --> 19:49.187
Hey, do not talk
about my wife's vagina

19:49.271 --> 19:50.272
at church lunch, do you hear me?

19:50.272 --> 19:52.065
It's okay, baby.
She's just jealous.

19:52.149 --> 19:53.192
Oh, please.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.027
Because her wedding
wasn't even real.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.236
God.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.529
That was cold.

19:57.613 --> 19:59.406
Not letting Daddy
walk you down the aisle.

19:59.406 --> 20:01.408
There was not a aisle, dummy!

20:01.408 --> 20:04.453
I don't know how many fucking
times I need to say that.

20:04.453 --> 20:06.788
It was just, like,
a area by rides, okay?

20:06.872 --> 20:07.915
Daddy knows.

20:07.915 --> 20:09.750
Disney World was a thing.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.919
It was BJ's dream wedding
destination.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.795
So we did it Nike style, dog.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.297
We just did it, okay?

20:15.297 --> 20:16.465
That's how we roll.

20:16.465 --> 20:17.758
We're seat-of-our-pants.

20:17.758 --> 20:19.092
We're fun kids.

20:19.176 --> 20:21.470
We're whim babies, so...

20:21.470 --> 20:22.971
We meant no disrespect, Daddy.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.306
Ugh, Daddy.

20:24.306 --> 20:26.308
I just wanna know
who officiated the wedding.

20:26.308 --> 20:28.143
Was it Donald or was it Goofy?

20:28.143 --> 20:29.811
- Oh!
- Ooh, slice.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.313
That was a good one.

20:31.313 --> 20:33.106
It was Prince Eric,
for your information.

20:33.190 --> 20:34.107
- Thank you.
- Prince Eric?

20:34.191 --> 20:35.150
Who the fuck is that?

20:35.150 --> 20:36.777
The boy
from "The Little Mermaid."

20:36.777 --> 20:38.946
The hottest guy
in the entire Disney catalog.

20:38.946 --> 20:40.948
Ariel's boyfriend,
you fucking bitches.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.282
- Oh, God.
- Oh, Lord.

20:42.366 --> 20:43.617
Y'all went down to Disney World,

20:43.617 --> 20:45.160
didn't invite any family
to come to your wedding,

20:45.160 --> 20:47.496
and you didn't even get
a legacy character to marry you.

20:47.496 --> 20:49.289
What legacy character
were we supposed to go for

20:49.373 --> 20:50.958
that's better than Prince Eric?
- Oh, I don't know.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.376
How 'bout Mickey Mouse?

20:52.376 --> 20:53.794
Man, fuck Mickey!

20:53.794 --> 20:55.003
Enough!

20:55.087 --> 20:56.838
Judy, I don't want to discuss

20:56.922 --> 20:58.006
the mermaid wedding.
- Yes, sir.

20:58.090 --> 21:01.009
Jesse, I'm not going anywhere.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.971
So there's no need to start
working on who's taking over.

21:03.971 --> 21:05.847
Okay, I'm just saying,
you know, at your age...

21:05.931 --> 21:07.474
it's probably never too early
to think about the future.

21:07.474 --> 21:09.643
You know, I mean, you could be
sitting here being fine

21:09.643 --> 21:11.436
one minute, doing church lunch
and ministering,

21:11.520 --> 21:12.896
and the next minute you can't
even wipe your own shits.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.648
Then the whole entire church
goes down to the caboodles

21:14.648 --> 21:16.149
because nobody knows
who's gonna run it.

21:16.233 --> 21:17.484
That--that--that's
where I'm coming from.

21:17.484 --> 21:19.653
Well, I appreciate
your concern.

21:19.653 --> 21:21.488
But like I said...

21:21.488 --> 21:23.782
I'm not going anywhere.

Hey, uh, Lyle,
I think God is ready to talk.

24:17.122 --> 24:19.082
What do you think?

24:19.166 --> 24:21.126
I think so too, Lindy.

24:21.126 --> 24:25.755
Question is,
are you all ready to Lisson?

24:28.592 --> 24:29.676
That's good.

24:29.676 --> 24:31.052
Do you want it?

24:31.136 --> 24:32.804
Yeah!

24:32.888 --> 24:34.556
- Who wants it?
- Do you want the power

24:34.556 --> 24:36.266
of the Holy Spirit in you?

24:37.726 --> 24:39.352
Can't hear you now.
What, what did you say now?

24:40.896 --> 24:45.233
Well, then all you got to do
is take it.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.360
Take it!

24:49.029 --> 24:51.281
Yeah, you felt that, right?
- I know I did.

24:51.281 --> 24:53.241
You want
the Holy Spirit right now?

24:54.451 --> 24:55.869
Oh, yes.

24:55.869 --> 24:57.454
Yeah, this is awesome.

24:57.454 --> 24:59.956
Is this what you want?

25:00.040 --> 25:01.374
It's what I want.

25:01.458 --> 25:03.418
Now, you, right there!

25:03.418 --> 25:04.920
Take it!

25:04.920 --> 25:06.671
Oh.

25:06.755 --> 25:09.549
Take it, take it,
take it, take it!

25:09.633 --> 25:12.761
Take it, take it, take it!

25:21.770 --> 25:23.897
Don't mind if I do.
Mm.

25:23.897 --> 25:26.733
Look, I just wanna thank y'all
for inviting our family out here

25:26.733 --> 25:27.901
for this little hang sesh.

25:27.901 --> 25:30.237
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, Gemstones rule the east.

25:30.237 --> 25:31.738
Lissons rule the west.

25:31.738 --> 25:34.574
Why has it taken us this long
to combine forces

25:34.658 --> 25:36.826
and see what God can do
with this synergy?

25:36.910 --> 25:38.536
Y'all like beach vacations?

25:38.620 --> 25:40.914
Live for 'em.
Waves and sunbeams.

25:40.914 --> 25:43.583
Yes, well, how would you like
to take a vacation

25:43.667 --> 25:46.836
at the beach with Jesus Christ?

25:46.920 --> 25:49.798
I would love
to go there with Him.

25:49.798 --> 25:52.217
Okay, well that's good news
'cause we got plans

25:52.217 --> 25:54.302
to construct a temple
of sun and sand

25:54.386 --> 25:56.888
in honor of our love for Christ.

25:56.972 --> 26:00.475
We're calling this place
Zion's Landing.

26:00.475 --> 26:01.893
It's a Christian
time-share resort

26:01.977 --> 26:03.270
on the sunny beaches of Florida.

26:03.270 --> 26:04.980
Whoo!
Sounds too good to be true.

26:04.980 --> 26:06.648
Well, pulling something
like Zion's Landing off

26:06.648 --> 26:08.024
ain't gonna be easy now.

26:08.108 --> 26:10.902
Lindy and I said we got
to align ourselves

26:10.986 --> 26:12.279
with the biggest and the best.

26:12.279 --> 26:14.114
I mean, only pure thoroughbreds.

26:14.114 --> 26:16.449
Whew, well, I appreciate you
seeing the Gemstones

26:16.533 --> 26:17.492
as thoroughbreds.

26:17.492 --> 26:19.202
That's exactly how
we see y'all too.

26:19.286 --> 26:20.495
- We do.
- Powerful...

26:20.495 --> 26:22.122
Christian horses-type folks.

26:22.122 --> 26:24.582
I mean,
we have waited a long time--

26:24.666 --> 26:25.709
- Oh, yeah.
- To get the power from Lyle's

26:25.709 --> 26:26.876
mama and daddy.
- Mm-hmm.

26:26.960 --> 26:28.837
Now that we have it...

26:28.837 --> 26:31.589
we're gonna do so many
wonderful things in His name.

26:31.673 --> 26:32.841
- Mm-hmm.
- That is so amazing that you

26:32.841 --> 26:34.592
say that because we're about
to get the reigns

26:34.676 --> 26:35.927
from Jesse's daddy.

26:36.011 --> 26:38.388
And we wanna do things
just like this.

26:38.388 --> 26:40.348
Well, pop the champagne.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.183
That is wonderful news.
- Yes.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.728
When's your daddy planning
on stepping down?

26:44.728 --> 26:46.187
- Well, he did--
- He didn't--

26:47.439 --> 26:48.648
- We're--
- He hasn't really--

26:48.732 --> 26:49.816
- We're getting him there.
- He's--he hasn't

26:49.816 --> 26:51.943
really admitted
that the time has come.

26:52.027 --> 26:53.653
Yet.
- We're getting him there.

26:53.737 --> 26:54.779
- Close.
- Mm-hmm.

26:54.863 --> 26:55.947
Real close.

26:56.031 --> 26:57.449
Lyle's parents
were the same way.

26:57.449 --> 27:00.160
- Mm-hmm.
- Same generation as Eli.

27:00.160 --> 27:01.328
Boomers.

27:01.328 --> 27:02.829
- Mm.
- Most selfish generation

27:02.829 --> 27:03.830
to ever live.

27:03.830 --> 27:05.081
Ooh, you said it, girl.

27:05.165 --> 27:06.333
They won't
get the hell out of the way

27:06.333 --> 27:08.043
even when it's God's plan.

27:08.043 --> 27:10.211
Okay, let's be real
with one another here.

27:10.295 --> 27:11.212
Parents suck.

27:13.757 --> 27:15.091
- Yeah.
- Couldn't agree more.

27:15.175 --> 27:16.384
Parents do suck.

27:16.468 --> 27:17.552
Siblings too.

27:17.552 --> 27:18.720
My sister tried to pop off

27:18.720 --> 27:20.138
when Daddy had his stroke.

27:20.138 --> 27:21.806
Trying to act like
she was running things.

27:21.890 --> 27:23.391
- Just 'cause she's a nurse.
- Yeah.

27:23.475 --> 27:26.019
I told my sister nuh-uh.

27:26.019 --> 27:29.022
Showed force,
chased her ass out.

27:29.022 --> 27:32.150
Got my daddy's ass
into assisted living.

27:32.150 --> 27:33.693
See, this is the kinda stories
I need to hear.

27:33.777 --> 27:35.445
- Yeah.
- You gotta marginalize

27:35.445 --> 27:36.696
your siblings.
- Mm-hmm.

27:36.780 --> 27:40.241
Firstborns lead the way
when parents trip.

27:40.325 --> 27:41.368
Period.

27:41.368 --> 27:42.702
- Firstborns.
- Both of you?

27:42.786 --> 27:44.120
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

27:44.204 --> 27:45.538
- Both of us.
- No.

27:45.622 --> 27:46.539
Firstborns.

27:48.083 --> 27:49.793
I knew it,
I knew it, I knew it.

27:49.793 --> 27:50.960
I knew I liked them.

27:51.044 --> 27:53.463
- Mm-hmm.
- Can we count on your support?

27:53.463 --> 27:56.424
Lissons and Gemstones making
Christian tourism history?

27:59.803 --> 28:00.929
Praise be.

28:03.390 --> 28:05.433
- Oh!
- I'll tell you what,

28:05.517 --> 28:08.978
you got mine and my wife's,
uh, total support.

28:09.062 --> 28:10.230
- Mm-hmm.
- Now technically,

28:10.230 --> 28:13.316
we are gonna have to run this
past my daddy.

28:13.400 --> 28:15.402
Let's bring him on down
to the project site.

28:15.402 --> 28:17.237
- Yeah.
- Ol' Lyle can kiss

28:17.237 --> 28:19.406
a parent's ass
like nobody's business.

28:19.406 --> 28:22.534
I will butter Eli's balls
and toss in a side of biscuits.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.244
He could use
some ball-buttering.

28:25.954 --> 28:27.288
We'll get his approval.

28:30.667 --> 28:37.674
<i>♪ ♪</i>

28:44.597 --> 28:46.516
So we're gonna cut
all this down.

28:46.516 --> 28:48.435
Wipe this maritime forest
right out.

28:48.435 --> 28:49.727
- Oh.
- Uh-huh.

28:49.811 --> 28:51.938
There is a small issue
with the sea turtles.

28:51.938 --> 28:53.773
Apparently this is a sanctuary.

28:53.857 --> 28:55.442
They don't like bright lights
or whatever.

28:55.442 --> 28:56.734
That's just people
being silly.

28:56.818 --> 28:57.777
We'll get past that.
- Ow!

28:57.861 --> 28:58.862
They'll get past that, Daddy.

28:58.862 --> 29:01.281
So we gonna put three towers
up here.

29:01.281 --> 29:04.409
And between 'em is where
we'll have our splash zone,

29:04.409 --> 29:06.494
adult pool, hot tubs.

29:06.578 --> 29:07.954
- It's here?
- Yeah.

29:07.954 --> 29:09.664
Okay, so the hot tubs are near
where the elephants

29:09.664 --> 29:11.207
hose down Noah's ark?
- That's right.

29:11.291 --> 29:12.459
God, that's smart.

29:12.459 --> 29:17.505
And a performance stage
on the flotilla.

29:17.589 --> 29:21.801
Imagine preaching
with that incredible backdrop.

29:21.885 --> 29:24.429
That ain't it sad it ain't
a painting, brother.

29:24.429 --> 29:25.972
No, that is no Thomas Kinkade,
Daddy.

29:25.972 --> 29:27.474
That's the real deal
right there.

29:27.474 --> 29:28.683
Mm-hmm.

29:28.683 --> 29:30.143
God is speaking to us
in these waves.

29:30.143 --> 29:31.603
This is his miracle.

29:31.603 --> 29:32.896
Mm-hmm, that's right, Amber.

29:32.896 --> 29:34.647
God's miracle.
- Smells.

29:34.731 --> 29:37.484
Lot of Christians would love
to visit a place like this.

29:37.484 --> 29:38.818
Especially if it's all-inclusive,

29:38.902 --> 29:41.154
top-notch restaurants,
and a kid's club.

29:41.154 --> 29:42.822
Come on now.

29:42.906 --> 29:44.699
Hang on,
there's kids allowed here?

29:44.699 --> 29:45.992
Yeah, duh.
Of course.

29:45.992 --> 29:48.536
I'm not coming then,
because that is an ultimate

29:48.620 --> 29:50.330
and immediate vibe-killer.

29:50.330 --> 29:52.081
Makes it seem dirty and cheap.

29:52.165 --> 29:53.500
I don't know about that.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.502
Kids mean bacteria.
No thanks.

29:55.502 --> 29:57.003
