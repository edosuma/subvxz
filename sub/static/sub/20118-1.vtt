02:31.720 --> 02:33.995
Oxygen levels are dropping.

02:38.320 --> 02:40.072
Brain function normal.

02:44.400 --> 02:47.517
Cerebral salvage
ready to proceed.

02:53.080 --> 02:57.437
Robotic skeleton prepared
and waiting for brain insertion.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.436
Initiate Project 2571.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.310
Now your eyes are gon na open.

05:29.680 --> 05:30.795
There.

05:33.080 --> 05:34.752
You're safe.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.668
It's okay,
just breathe.

05:50.680 --> 05:52.272
Just breathe.

05:53.880 --> 05:55.074
Breathe.

05:57.120 --> 05:58.269
Good.

05:58.600 --> 06:00.113
That's good.

06:03.520 --> 06:04.953
Hello, Mira.

06:05.680 --> 06:07.511
I'm Dr. Ouelet.

06:10.800 --> 06:13.712
Do you remember anything
about the attack?

06:15.000 --> 06:16.513
What happened?

06:17.680 --> 06:19.750
I was drowning.

06:21.040 --> 06:22.473
There's water!

06:23.480 --> 06:25.710
That's right.
You were on a boat.

06:25.800 --> 06:27.119
A refugee boat.

06:27.480 --> 06:29.630
It was sunk by terrorists.

06:30.480 --> 06:32.710
Why can't I feel my body?

06:33.400 --> 06:34.776
Mira,
your body was damaged.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.074
We couldn't save it.

06:36.640 --> 06:38.710
Only your brain survived.

06:39.320 --> 06:41.470
We made you a new body.

06:41.720 --> 06:43.551
A synthetic shell.

06:45.480 --> 06:48.153
But your mind, your soul,

06:48.480 --> 06:49.959
your "ghost,"

06:50.040 --> 06:51.553
it's still in there.

06:54.840 --> 06:55.840
Please.

06:55.920 --> 06:57.239
Sedate her.

07:12.320 --> 07:13.799
Will it work?

07:14.200 --> 07:15.758
Absolutely.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.238
She's a miracle.

07:20.320 --> 07:23.437
A machine can't lead,
it can only follow orders.

07:23.520 --> 07:26.478
A machine can't imagine
or care or intuit.

07:26.880 --> 07:30.077
But as a human mind
in a cybernetic frame,

07:30.160 --> 07:32.674
Mira can do all
those things, and more.

07:33.080 --> 07:34.911
The first of her kind.

07:37.160 --> 07:40.152
She will join Section 9
as soon as she is operational.

07:40.520 --> 07:42.670
Please, don't do that.

07:42.880 --> 07:46.031
You're reducing
a complex human to a machine.

07:46.680 --> 07:48.830
I don't think of her as a machine.

07:50.080 --> 07:51.593
She's a weapon.

07:52.560 --> 07:54.915
And the future of my company.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.953
The first artificially
created memory enhancement.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.576
Sirenum's training protocol

08:20.600 --> 08:22.477
is the fastest and most efficient way

08:22.560 --> 08:24.630
to develop the abilities
you've always wanted.

08:24.720 --> 08:26.199
Stronger than ever.

08:26.280 --> 08:27.840
Experience your power
with Pneuma Glove.

08:29.240 --> 08:31.959
Stronger than ever.
Experience your power.

08:32.960 --> 08:35.269
Cyber-crime is a type-one offense.

08:35.360 --> 08:37.635
Minimum punishment,
15 years in prison.

08:37.720 --> 08:39.096
Hanka Robotics guarantees

08:39.120 --> 08:42.395
personal safety and integrity
against outside threats.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.594
All patrolling air units be advised.

08:50.680 --> 08:53.148
Possible cyber-crime activity
in the vicinity.

08:53.480 --> 08:56.199
Airspace in all
adjoining areas to be locked down.

08:56.440 --> 08:58.237
Section 9 is currently on site.

08:58.320 --> 09:01.596
Repeat: All patrolling
air units be advised.

09:01.960 --> 09:04.315
Possible cyber-crime activity
in the vicinity.

09:06.640 --> 09:08.790
Th is is Major. I'm on site.

09:09.160 --> 09:10.957
Awaiting instructions.

09:23.680 --> 09:26.148
I'm human. I'm flawed.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.878
But I embrace change

09:29.960 --> 09:31.473
and enhancement.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.550
Now there's nothing I can't do.

09:34.880 --> 09:38.873
Nothing I can't know.
Nothing I can't be.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.472
I want you to listen to something.

09:51.200 --> 09:52.872
That's my
four-year-old daughter.

09:53.200 --> 09:54.960
In the time it took her
to sing that lullaby,

09:55.000 --> 09:56.672
she learned to
speak fluent French.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.718
Did you know that song...

09:59.000 --> 10:00.991
There's an echo box up here.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.997
Someone's scanning data traffic.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.080
Let's see who's worth
this kind of surveillance.

10:10.920 --> 10:13.229
Accessing hotel security network.

10:18.600 --> 10:19.999
What are you seeing, sir?

10:20.080 --> 10:21.559
I've got a lot of hotel to scan.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.236
Got it. 43rd floor.

10:38.960 --> 10:41.997
Someone contact the President's
staff. Someone's watching him.

10:42.160 --> 10:43.309
Dr. Osmond,

10:43.400 --> 10:45.675
what is it you want from us?

10:45.760 --> 10:48.797
I think it's more about
what Hanka Robotics can do for you.

10:49.120 --> 10:53.432
73% of this world has woken up
to the age of cyber-enhancement.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.797
You really want to be left behind?

10:55.960 --> 11:00.112
My people embrace
cyber-enhancement, as do I.

11:00.440 --> 11:03.318
But there's no one who really
understands the risk

11:03.400 --> 11:07.678
to individuality, identity,
messing with the human soul.

11:09.600 --> 11:11.600
Gentlemen. Excuse me.
I think you have the wrong...

11:17.280 --> 11:18.838
Hallway. Six men. Shots fired.

11:19.880 --> 11:20.995
Section 9 ETA?

11:21.080 --> 11:22.800
- Two minutes out, Major.
- Too long.

11:23.080 --> 11:24.274
I'm going in.

11:39.120 --> 11:42.032
I've heard this speech
before from your competitors.

11:42.120 --> 11:44.509
And now Hanka Robotics
serves it with milky sake.

11:44.640 --> 11:45.640
What are you doing?

11:46.760 --> 11:47.840
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

11:47.880 --> 11:49.916
Look. This is what
I'm talking about.

12:20.560 --> 12:23.836
Initiate the hack.

13:40.080 --> 13:43.152
Help me.
Please. Don't let me die.

13:43.400 --> 13:44.400
Who sent you?

13:44.480 --> 13:45.993
Help me. Please.

13:46.080 --> 13:47.149
Answer me!

13:47.840 --> 13:49.696
Collaborate with Hanka Robotics

13:49.720 --> 13:51.153
and be destroyed.

14:08.040 --> 14:09.040
Uh-uh.

14:11.480 --> 14:12.629
You okay?

14:16.000 --> 14:17.319
You're injured.

14:27.320 --> 14:29.072
You're not the same.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.160
Hey.

14:31.520 --> 14:33.272
It's just a robot!

15:54.200 --> 15:57.192
Your skin
deserves the best, and so do you.

15:57.320 --> 15:58.548
Try our hand cream.

16:19.880 --> 16:21.711
So, what do we have
on Osmond?

16:21.800 --> 16:22.949
So far, very little.

16:24.640 --> 16:27.154
He was the head
of Hanka's robotics division.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.829
Human, but of course
cyber-enhanced.

16:30.040 --> 16:31.359
So how did they hack him?

16:31.440 --> 16:34.273
Somehow this geisha bot
got past his encryption.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.192
Something's different.

16:36.400 --> 16:37.435
What'd you get?

16:37.720 --> 16:40.234
Why do you
always think he's out there enhancing?

16:40.320 --> 16:41.673
Because he is.

16:42.720 --> 16:44.039
Cyber-mech liver.

16:44.200 --> 16:45.758
Been saving up for a while.

16:46.080 --> 16:47.559
Now it's last call every night.

16:48.120 --> 16:50.031
You got enhanced
so you can drink more?

16:51.280 --> 16:52.998
Embrace the enhancements, Togusa.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.072
We wouldn't be here without it.

16:55.240 --> 16:57.276
I'm all human and happy, thanks.

16:58.920 --> 17:01.434
Any more information
about the ceased geisha bot?

17:01.600 --> 17:02.828
Hanka's running scans.

17:03.120 --> 17:05.270
Dr. Dahlin will have
the reports ready by...

17:20.599 --> 17:22.440
Following last night's attack,

17:23.280 --> 17:25.748
three more Hanka scientists
were murdered

17:26.000 --> 17:27.592
at the company's
central laboratory.

17:28.880 --> 17:30.552
The first two were shot,

17:30.960 --> 17:32.678
and the third
was beaten to death

17:32.760 --> 17:34.318
by his own service robot.

17:35.320 --> 17:38.471
All showed signs
of cerebral hacking.

17:39.480 --> 17:41.152
The same as the geisha did to Osmond.

17:42.240 --> 17:45.789
And all were
senior figures at Hanka,

17:46.360 --> 17:47.475
just like Osmond.

17:48.600 --> 17:52.479
A message was left at each
of the crime scenes by someone

17:52.560 --> 17:54.232
identifying himself

17:56.480 --> 17:57.913
as Kuze.

17:58.760 --> 18:02.389
Collaborate with Hanka Robotics
and be destroyed.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.993
Collaborate with Hanka Robotics
and be destroyed.

18:11.160 --> 18:12.160
Togusa.

18:45.720 --> 18:48.109
I had to or more would have died.

18:54.040 --> 18:56.793
I will find him and I will kill him.

18:57.400 --> 19:00.631
It's what I am
built for, isn't it?

19:24.720 --> 19:25.994
Locus Solus,

19:26.080 --> 19:29.675
safely reconfiguring
your child's genetic structure.

19:29.760 --> 19:32.069
Families built better.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.436
What was going on with you
at the hotel last night?

19:34.520 --> 19:35.714
Nothing. I'm fine.

19:35.800 --> 19:36.949
You sure?

19:38.720 --> 19:41.029
- Hey, sweetheart, you want an upgrade?
- Move. Move.

19:41.240 --> 19:43.231
- I have anything you want.
- Back off!

19:46.480 --> 19:48.516
- Hey, Ming!
- Hey, Batou!

19:48.600 --> 19:49.635
Hey.

19:51.800 --> 19:53.916
- I got your bones.
- Thanks, man.

19:54.880 --> 19:56.108
For the dogs.

19:56.840 --> 19:58.240
For someone who
doesn't like people,

19:58.280 --> 19:59.872
how come you care
about dogs so much?

20:00.120 --> 20:02.953
Don't know.
I just like strays, and they like me.

20:03.240 --> 20:05.390
They like you
because you feed them.

20:05.800 --> 20:07.279
You got no heart.

20:07.960 --> 20:09.279
Hey, girls!

20:13.000 --> 20:14.069
Hey!

20:14.680 --> 20:16.159
Hey, Gabriel.

20:17.240 --> 20:18.468
Meet Major.

20:18.760 --> 20:20.432
Major, Gabriel.

20:24.480 --> 20:26.311
We used to have a dog.

20:26.760 --> 20:27.795
Seriously?

20:31.720 --> 20:34.393
I had you down as
more of a cat person.

20:39.160 --> 20:41.230
You don't talk
about that stuff, huh?

20:41.320 --> 20:42.320
What?

20:42.560 --> 20:45.438
- Your past.
- I don't remember much.

20:45.720 --> 20:47.358
Just fragments.
Bits and pieces.

20:49.320 --> 20:50.878
What about family?

20:51.120 --> 20:53.554
My parents, they died
bringing us to this country.

20:53.680 --> 20:55.113
Our boat sank in the harbor.

20:55.640 --> 20:57.471
I almost drowned.

20:59.400 --> 21:00.628
It feels like

21:00.720 --> 21:03.075
there's always this
thick fog over my memory

21:03.160 --> 21:04.957
and I can't see through it.

21:05.880 --> 21:06.995
You're lucky.

21:07.320 --> 21:09.959
Every single day
I get screwed by my memories.

21:10.240 --> 21:11.593
It's better to be pure.

21:12.400 --> 21:13.515
Like you.

21:31.840 --> 21:34.513
Welcome to Hanka Robotics.

21:35.400 --> 21:39.598
All visitors must display
appropriate credentials at all times.

21:43.880 --> 21:45.552
Open and close, please.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.834
You have damaged
internal systems.

21:49.920 --> 21:52.354
Maybe next time,
you can design me better.

21:56.080 --> 21:57.080
How are you?

21:57.200 --> 21:58.440
I'm fine.
I can't feel anything.

21:58.480 --> 22:01.233
No, you. In there.

22:02.720 --> 22:04.836
I've been having glitches.

22:05.600 --> 22:06.953
But they'll pass.

22:07.560 --> 22:08.920
You've been
taking your medication?

22:09.200 --> 22:10.394
Yeah.

22:10.760 --> 22:12.080
But these ones are still cycling.

22:12.640 --> 22:13.914
I had two this morning.

22:14.240 --> 22:16.595
- Sound or image?
- Both.

22:20.240 --> 22:21.753
I see it.

22:22.880 --> 22:24.996
Have you made
any unencrypted downloads?

22:25.080 --> 22:27.469
- No. Just delete them for me.
- Consent?

22:27.560 --> 22:28.959
My name is Major Mira Killian,

22:29.040 --> 22:31.429
and I give my consent
to delete this data.

22:32.200 --> 22:33.269
It's done.

22:33.800 --> 22:35.677
- No big deal.
- What are they?

22:36.920 --> 22:39.718
Sensory echoes from
your mind. Shadows.

22:39.800 --> 22:40.949
Can't be sure.

22:41.200 --> 22:43.000
How do you know
what's a glitch and what's me?

22:43.280 --> 22:45.953
The glitches have
a different texture

22:46.280 --> 22:48.191
to the rest of your code.

22:50.600 --> 22:52.192
I can see everything.

22:53.640 --> 22:56.791
All of your thoughts,
your decisions.

22:57.400 --> 22:59.072
I guess privacy is just for humans.

22:59.160 --> 23:00.832
You are human.

23:02.400 --> 23:04.197
People see you as human.

23:04.400 --> 23:06.868
Everyone around me seems to fit.

23:07.200 --> 23:10.636
They seem connected
to something, something I am

23:11.160 --> 23:12.479
not.

23:14.400 --> 23:15.469
It's like I have no past.

23:15.560 --> 23:16.959
Of course you have a past.

23:17.160 --> 23:19.176
And with time you'll feel
more and more connected to it,

23:19.200 --> 23:20.553
and to them.

23:24.280 --> 23:25.429
Open and close, please.

23:35.080 --> 23:38.516
We cling to memories
as if they define us,

23:39.800 --> 23:41.279
but they really don't.

23:42.640 --> 23:45.108
What we do is what defines us.

23:47.760 --> 23:50.320
You are entering a Hanka secure area.

23:50.400 --> 23:51.992
Authorized personnel only.

23:52.560 --> 23:55.711
Please disable
communication enhancements.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.149
I'm busy.

23:57.240 --> 23:59.629
Dr. Dahlin!
Are you finished yet?

24:00.320 --> 24:02.356
If you hadn't riddled
the geisha with bullets,

24:02.440 --> 24:03.589
this would be much easier.

24:03.680 --> 24:06.035
- I didn't shoot her.
- I did.

24:06.200 --> 24:09.192
This is gonna take days.

24:09.960 --> 24:12.428
I need to run hundreds
of potential simulations.

24:12.520 --> 24:13.520
We don't have the time.

24:17.120 --> 24:19.315
She was a Hanka companion bot.

24:20.880 --> 24:23.553
But she was reprogramed
for cerebral hacking.

24:24.760 --> 24:26.432
What was on her drives?

24:26.600 --> 24:27.600
Nothing.

24:28.080 --> 24:29.911
The data was destroyed
as it was transmitted.

24:30.880 --> 24:32.871
No sign what she was after.

24:33.320 --> 24:35.390
The hardware was vandalized.

24:36.040 --> 24:37.792
They ripped her up!

24:38.240 --> 24:39.559
Then I have to do a Deep Dive.

24:40.720 --> 24:43.234
You can't encrypt
during a Deep Dive.

24:43.400 --> 24:44.719
I know.

24:46.240 --> 24:48.196
They could have left traps in her.

24:48.280 --> 24:50.714
Mag pulses. Viruses.

24:50.920 --> 24:52.069
She's right.

24:52.800 --> 24:55.360
You'll be exposing your mind
to whoever hacked her.

24:55.560 --> 24:56.879
You'll be wide open.

25:00.160 --> 25:02.116
I have to get
inside her memory.

25:02.320 --> 25:04.038
It's the fastest way to find Kuze.

25:10.320 --> 25:11.912
It's too dangerous.

25:12.120 --> 25:14.315
And highly irresponsible.

25:19.520 --> 25:20.839
Are you sure?

25:21.720 --> 25:23.676
You see any bad code
headed my way, pull me out.

25:27.440 --> 25:28.720
How come you're
the one sweating?

25:37.640 --> 25:38.640
Run it.

25:47.480 --> 25:49.630
Cyber-mind
connection to the Major

25:49.720 --> 25:51.790
now active and unencrypted.

25:54.120 --> 25:56.111
Consent required
for data download.

25:56.320 --> 25:59.471
My name is Major Mira Killian,
and I give my consent.

26:21.920 --> 26:23.840
Thank you.

27:40.040 --> 27:41.519
Disconnect.
Get her out.

27:41.880 --> 27:42.880
Get her out!

27:42.960 --> 27:45.030
I'm trying,
but she's being hacked.

27:48.640 --> 27:49.914
Get her out now!

27:53.480 --> 27:54.549
Now!

27:55.560 --> 27:57.710
Are you okay?

28:00.680 --> 28:02.193
I know where he is.

28:16.400 --> 28:17.628
I know this place.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.116
They run black market mech.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.792
- You tooled up?
- Yep.

28:23.160 --> 28:25.230
Target's the basement.
I'll lead.

28:25.320 --> 28:27.038
Switching to mind-comms.

28:27.640 --> 28:30.279
- Hope you've been practicing.
- That's unfair.

28:31.840 --> 28:33.956
It just takes me a moment to

28:34.120 --> 28:35.553
get the hang of it.

28:45.400 --> 28:48.790
Two mercs at the doors.
Armed and enhanced.

28:49.240 --> 28:51.708
Copy that.
We've got it covered.

29:02.400 --> 29:04.480
There's a lot
of heat in here for a nightclub.

29:04.680 --> 29:07.911
It's a Yakuza club.
What did you expect?

29:08.240 --> 29:09.673
I quite like the place.

29:10.080 --> 29:11.991
Why doesn't
that surprise me?

29:12.680 --> 29:14.591
I'm gonna have to
draw some attention,

29:14.680 --> 29:16.910
see if I can access
the basement that way.

29:20.840 --> 29:22.876
You're not here
looking for any trouble, are you?

29:22.960 --> 29:26.191
I'm just here for
the girls and the beer.

29:29.400 --> 29:31.834
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for someone.

29:32.080 --> 29:33.433
You been here before?

29:33.520 --> 29:36.273
My friend had some mech work
done here. Industry stuff.

29:36.360 --> 29:37.952
We don't do mech work here.

29:38.680 --> 29:40.079
My mistake.

29:40.680 --> 29:42.477
Why don't you come
have fun with us?

29:42.560 --> 29:43.993
We'll have some privacy.

29:52.040 --> 29:53.075
I'm in.

29:53.840 --> 29:55.478
I'll be here
when you need me.

30:07.960 --> 30:09.279
You say your friend
worked here?

30:09.360 --> 30:12.079
I said my friend
had work done here.

30:13.240 --> 30:14.559
She's human?

30:15.200 --> 30:16.599
Your friend.

30:17.080 --> 30:19.230
Now what's that supposed to mean?

30:19.320 --> 30:20.389
Batou.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.035
Can you hear me?

30:22.120 --> 30:26.113
Who did this
stunning work on you?

30:26.480 --> 30:27.879
It's divine.

30:34.920 --> 30:36.148
Ladriya. Guns.

30:37.280 --> 30:38.474
Here.

30:41.520 --> 30:43.351
Batou, I'm losing signal.

30:43.520 --> 30:45.511
Don't worry, sweetie.

30:46.440 --> 30:47.919
We have privacy.

30:49.480 --> 30:50.515
Listen.

30:51.160 --> 30:53.469
No signals going in or out.

30:54.520 --> 30:57.193
Major, I'm in position.
Do you copy?

30:58.120 --> 30:59.120
Beer.

31:00.960 --> 31:03.599
If you don't answer,
you're gonna hurt my feelings.

31:11.440 --> 31:13.908
Ladriya, do you have Major
on comms?

31:14.000 --> 31:16.639
Got nothing.
Signal's still blocked.

31:17.120 --> 31:19.793
I'm afraid I get
bored rather easily, so,

31:20.480 --> 31:22.072
if you don't want to talk,

31:23.800 --> 31:25.950
maybe you want to dance!

31:28.480 --> 31:30.471
Major, come on.
Answer me.

31:46.600 --> 31:48.477
I thought you said no trouble.

31:48.680 --> 31:50.520
Dance.

31:52.440 --> 31:55.079
No! Enough!

31:57.160 --> 31:58.309
The truth is...

31:58.520 --> 31:59.839
Hmm.

31:59.960 --> 32:01.632
...I wasn't built to dance.

32:55.880 --> 32:58.917
Back on comms.
I'm heading to the back room.

32:59.240 --> 33:02.312
I missed you.
I'll meet you there.

33:33.920 --> 33:37.435
Collaborate with Hanka Robotics
and be destroyed.

33:47.760 --> 33:49.273
Major?

33:52.720 --> 33:54.915
Hey.

34:22.199 --> 34:23.679
Where's Batou?

34:24.239 --> 34:27.471
In Enhancement
next door. He's doing well.

34:29.360 --> 34:31.668
You took most of the blast.

34:34.520 --> 34:36.431
I saw him down there.

34:38.239 --> 34:39.753
It was like...

34:41.239 --> 34:43.231
...he waited to see me.

34:44.239 --> 34:45.958
We synaptic-scanned you.

34:46.040 --> 34:49.510
Everything you witnessed
went to Section 9 to evaluate.

34:52.159 --> 34:54.116
You know, the scan

34:54.199 --> 34:56.668
also turned up
a number of glitches.

34:57.880 --> 34:59.836
They've been getting worse.

35:01.280 --> 35:02.599
Since when?

35:03.600 --> 35:05.033
Since the Deep Dive.

35:21.680 --> 35:24.399
Do any of the glitches
mean something to you?

35:25.880 --> 35:27.029
No.

35:28.040 --> 35:29.040
They don't.

35:31.360 --> 35:34.079
You've been inside
the same shell as he has.

35:34.720 --> 35:38.793
That could have
very serious consequences.

35:39.720 --> 35:42.951
You were not authorized
to Deep Dive the geisha.

35:43.960 --> 35:45.552
You're disappointed.

35:47.160 --> 35:48.991
No, I'm worried.

35:51.480 --> 35:53.232
You're not invulnerable.

35:54.240 --> 35:57.835
I can repair your body,
but I can't protect your mind.

35:58.440 --> 35:59.839
Why not?

36:03.160 --> 36:05.469
You can see all my thoughts,

36:06.200 --> 36:08.077
so you should be
able to secure them.

36:09.440 --> 36:12.591
Try and understand
your importance, Mira.

36:15.520 --> 36:18.512
You're what everyone
will become one day.

36:21.560 --> 36:24.438
You don't know how alone
that makes me feel.

36:42.120 --> 36:43.792
I can see you out there,
you know.

36:46.640 --> 36:48.471
How many fingers
am I holding up?

36:48.760 --> 36:50.671
Funny.

37:00.120 --> 37:02.315
Say something nice.

37:03.280 --> 37:05.157
You chose those?

37:05.520 --> 37:07.158
They're tactical.

37:07.920 --> 37:10.912
- Always for the job.
- What else I got?

37:11.680 --> 37:13.636
- They suit you.
- Yeah?

37:13.880 --> 37:16.474
I got night-vision, mile-zoom,

37:16.960 --> 37:18.075
and X-ray.

37:19.720 --> 37:21.438
I guess I see like you now.

37:22.200 --> 37:24.634
Don't worry.
You'll get used to it.

37:27.240 --> 37:28.992
Thanks for saving my ass.

37:29.920 --> 37:31.956
Glad to see you're okay.

37:32.600 --> 37:33.749
Major?

37:35.080 --> 37:37.196
Could you feed the dogs for me?

37:38.640 --> 37:39.993
I don't want to scare them.

37:40.440 --> 37:41.759
Anytime.

38:25.640 --> 38:28.677
Are you insufficiently funded,
Mr. Aramaki?

38:29.280 --> 38:32.795
Is Section 9 missing some
critical operational resource?

38:36.320 --> 38:38.456
Major is our most sophisticated weapon

38:38.480 --> 38:40.391
only if she's intact.

38:42.120 --> 38:43.633
And Dr. Ouelet informed me

38:43.720 --> 38:46.871
that you let her dive
a corrupted geisha.

38:55.440 --> 38:57.158
You realize
the supreme importance

38:57.240 --> 38:59.117
that Hanka represents
to this government.

39:00.440 --> 39:03.079
Major is the future of my company.

39:03.720 --> 39:06.393
If you compromise
her systems again,

39:07.120 --> 39:09.031
I will burn this section.

40:07.080 --> 40:08.991
Come here. With me.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.150
Create your own beauty.

40:12.240 --> 40:13.912
Beauty enhanced.

40:24.680 --> 40:25.999
You human?

40:27.720 --> 40:28.835
Yeah.

40:34.680 --> 40:36.193
Can you take that off

40:36.760 --> 40:38.910
so I can see your face?

41:04.720 --> 41:06.472
What does that feel like?

41:06.560 --> 41:07.595
It feels

41:08.280 --> 41:09.759
different.

41:21.080 --> 41:22.672
What are you?

41:59.200 --> 42:00.235
Look at me.

42:03.200 --> 42:05.589
Tell me what
they took from me.

42:07.480 --> 42:10.119
I'm sorry.
They never told us.

42:33.160 --> 42:35.879
It feels weird
driving with these eyes.

42:39.320 --> 42:40.912
Why do you take that?

42:41.000 --> 42:44.117
It keeps my brain
from rejecting this body.

42:46.320 --> 42:48.675
Major, Batou, you need to get here.

42:48.760 --> 42:50.273
What have you got?

42:50.360 --> 42:52.749
Another Hanka
scientist has been found dead.

42:52.880 --> 42:54.108
It's Dahlin.

42:54.560 --> 42:55.560
Got it.

43:02.920 --> 43:04.478
Major, this way.

43:34.080 --> 43:35.149
What is that?

43:36.920 --> 43:39.514
She found what Kuze
stole from Osmond.

43:40.360 --> 43:45.275
It's a list of everyone who
worked on a project called 2571.

43:45.360 --> 43:46.952
That's who he's targeting.

43:47.400 --> 43:49.231
Is anyone else on the list?

43:52.120 --> 43:54.395
Find Ouelet. Now!

43:54.560 --> 43:57.632
She's in transit.
Her comms are down.

44:02.240 --> 44:04.276
I'm looking at her
and I'm thinking,

44:04.360 --> 44:06.749
"You want me to pay for violin, too."

44:06.840 --> 44:08.398
Don't get me wrong.

44:09.240 --> 44:11.231
I love that kid to pieces.

44:11.440 --> 44:13.317
I do. She's amazing.

44:13.400 --> 44:16.915
But when she practices that
thing, it is painful, right?

44:17.560 --> 44:18.595
Why not piano?

44:19.080 --> 44:21.514
I mean,
it's the same price, you know?

44:21.600 --> 44:23.352
And doesn't sound so bad.

44:25.600 --> 44:28.910
At least, if you can't
play that proper, it sounds...

45:17.560 --> 45:20.120
2571. Tell me everything!

45:32.160 --> 45:34.196
Are you prepared
to die for 257...

45:43.200 --> 45:44.269
Go!

45:59.040 --> 46:00.075
Go!

47:57.960 --> 47:58.960
Where's Kuze?

47:59.400 --> 48:00.833
Why does he want to kill Ouelet?

48:00.920 --> 48:02.069
I don't know anything.

48:04.800 --> 48:06.791
Enough! Enough!

48:08.960 --> 48:10.473
We need him alive.

48:14.280 --> 48:16.999
Please,
I've been through this.

48:18.080 --> 48:20.071
You have the wrong guy.

48:21.240 --> 48:23.549
So tell us who we do have.

48:25.080 --> 48:28.390
My name is Lee Cunningham.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.070
- Where'd you get the weapons?
- I don't know.

48:34.160 --> 48:35.336
Who loaded them onto the truck?

48:35.360 --> 48:37.874
I don't know anything about
weapons, all right? I told you!

48:37.960 --> 48:40.315
I was picking up my daughter.
She takes violin lessons.

48:40.400 --> 48:41.833
What's her name?

48:45.000 --> 48:46.991
- Is this her?
- Yeah.

48:48.200 --> 48:50.031
Isn't she a little angel?

48:50.120 --> 48:51.792
- This is your daughter?
- Right.

48:54.520 --> 48:56.192
Do you have kids?

48:59.680 --> 49:01.352
Where do you live?

49:03.200 --> 49:04.713
I can't remember.

49:04.800 --> 49:08.076
I think it's a tall place.
Is it a tall building?

49:08.160 --> 49:10.037
It's a tall place, right?

49:11.240 --> 49:12.912
You don't have a child.

49:15.760 --> 49:18.069
You don't have a wife.
You live alone.

49:18.160 --> 49:19.957
- It's just you.
- What? No.

49:20.040 --> 49:21.696
We've been to your apartment.
There's nobody there.

49:21.720 --> 49:22.789
- No.
- You've lived there

49:22.880 --> 49:23.976
- for 10 years by yourself.
- No!

49:24.000 --> 49:25.000
So you're just lying.

49:25.040 --> 49:26.393
I'm not lying!

49:27.520 --> 49:29.476
I didn't kill anyone!

49:29.560 --> 49:31.949
- Why do you keep doing this to me?
- Holo cube disconnect.

49:32.040 --> 49:33.040
Please!

49:33.840 --> 49:35.831
I didn't do anything!

49:36.200 --> 49:37.952
Why do you keep
saying this to me?

49:38.040 --> 49:39.792
I don't understand.
How can he not know?

49:41.200 --> 49:44.875
The hack must have created
a vacuum. Kuze's wiped his memory

49:45.000 --> 49:47.355
and somehow installed
a new reality.

49:49.160 --> 49:51.515
At least, he got to
believe he had a kid.

49:52.600 --> 49:54.477
What's the difference, huh?

49:55.880 --> 49:57.757
Fantasy, reality.

49:57.840 --> 49:59.512
Dreams, memories.

50:00.720 --> 50:02.631
It's all the same.

50:03.240 --> 50:04.878
Just noise.

50:06.560 --> 50:07.560
It's him.

50:10.640 --> 50:12.119
He's in there.

50:14.760 --> 50:17.194
This cube is secure.
He can't be, Major.

50:17.680 --> 50:18.829
Lie detector.

50:19.000 --> 50:20.513
He must've hacked in that way.

50:20.680 --> 50:21.896
We should uplink to the machine,

50:21.920 --> 50:23.416
trace the code,
get a lock on his location.

50:23.440 --> 50:24.475
Do it.

50:24.760 --> 50:27.115
Don't go in there.
It's too dangerous!

50:43.800 --> 50:45.736
The signal's unstable.
Can you get a lock on it?

50:45.760 --> 50:46.760
Think so.

50:46.840 --> 50:48.831
We gotta move fast.
We're losing it.

50:49.000 --> 50:50.228
Connecting.

50:52.800 --> 50:54.028
Who are you?

50:57.120 --> 50:58.473
Come here.

51:00.760 --> 51:02.113
I am shy.

51:03.320 --> 51:05.709
I'm not beautiful

51:05.800 --> 51:06.800
like you.

51:10.040 --> 51:11.996
Tell me who you are.

51:12.280 --> 51:15.192
I have been born
more than once.

51:15.920 --> 51:18.480
So I have more than one name.

51:19.040 --> 51:20.598
I'll find you.

51:20.920 --> 51:22.353
Not yet.

51:23.160 --> 51:24.673
I'm not done.

51:24.920 --> 51:27.036
The machine
is tracing his location.

51:27.480 --> 51:28.629
We got a fix!

51:34.360 --> 51:35.998
I need to see her.

51:36.480 --> 51:38.232
No, please. I know...

51:38.320 --> 51:39.673
We got him.

51:47.760 --> 51:49.034
Let's go.

52:03.280 --> 52:04.679
Weapons up.

52:07.280 --> 52:08.918
- Go.
- On me.

52:56.920 --> 52:58.831
Stay down! Stay down!

53:08.680 --> 53:10.511
Put it down.
Put it down.

53:17.640 --> 53:18.640
Grenade!

54:15.680 --> 54:16.908
Major!

54:17.440 --> 54:18.759
Come in.

54:19.920 --> 54:21.911
I know why
we couldn't find him.

54:25.000 --> 54:28.197
He's using human minds
to create a network of his own.

54:28.360 --> 54:29.880
We're coming to your position.

55:45.160 --> 55:46.991
Tell me who you are.

55:49.360 --> 55:53.831
I am that
which you seek to destroy.

55:57.520 --> 56:00.114
In this life my name is

56:01.120 --> 56:02.120
Kuze.

56:04.880 --> 56:06.950
What are you doing to me?

56:09.720 --> 56:14.714
I have connected you
to a network of my own creation.

56:15.040 --> 56:17.270
When I am finished
in this world,

56:17.800 --> 56:22.112
my ghost can survive there
and regenerate.

56:22.600 --> 56:24.750
What do you want from me?

56:25.840 --> 56:27.398
I became

56:27.480 --> 56:30.119
fascinated with you,

56:31.640 --> 56:34.029
reading your code

56:34.160 --> 56:36.628
while you were inside
that geisha.

56:39.240 --> 56:42.949
Like nothing
I had felt before and yet so

56:43.800 --> 56:45.233
familiar.

56:47.640 --> 56:48.914
We are the same.

56:50.200 --> 56:51.997
We are not the same.

56:54.320 --> 56:56.311
You kill innocent people.

56:56.880 --> 56:59.314
"Innocent",
is that what you call them?

57:00.200 --> 57:02.634
I am as they made me.

57:03.840 --> 57:05.239
Who made you?

57:05.320 --> 57:07.356
What have they told you?

57:07.840 --> 57:09.956
That you were the first?

57:10.400 --> 57:12.994
The first cerebral salvage?

57:14.040 --> 57:17.589
You were born of lessons took

57:17.680 --> 57:19.477
from my failure.

57:21.120 --> 57:23.475
What are you talking about?

57:24.600 --> 57:27.353
I was conscious
while they dismembered

57:27.480 --> 57:29.675
my body and discarded me

57:29.800 --> 57:31.870
like garbage.

57:32.760 --> 57:35.558
I was lying on a table,

57:35.800 --> 57:38.394
listening to doctors
talk about how

57:38.520 --> 57:41.114
my mind had not meshed
with the shell

57:41.200 --> 57:42.713
that they had built.

57:44.040 --> 57:47.635
How Project 2571

57:47.720 --> 57:49.073
had failed,

57:49.920 --> 57:51.831
and they had to move on

57:58.040 --> 57:59.393
to you.

58:06.560 --> 58:08.915
What a beauty you are.

58:12.160 --> 58:14.469
They have improved us so much

58:14.560 --> 58:16.596
since they made me.

58:19.760 --> 58:24.117
They thought that we would be
a part of their evolution,

58:24.200 --> 58:26.714
but they have created us

58:26.800 --> 58:29.189
to evolve alone,

58:34.280 --> 58:35.599
beyond them.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.594
"Evolution",
that's what you call

58:39.360 --> 58:41.510
killing everyone who made you?

58:41.760 --> 58:44.115
You're not listening to me.

58:44.600 --> 58:46.272
You're a murderer.

58:46.480 --> 58:49.358
They tried to kill me first.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.309
It is self-defense.

58:53.400 --> 58:55.436
Defense of self!

58:58.120 --> 58:59.997
More will die

59:02.200 --> 59:03.838
until they tell me

59:03.920 --> 59:05.956
what they took!

59:06.040 --> 59:07.473
I won't let that happen.

59:09.800 --> 59:11.472
You want to kill me?

59:15.880 --> 59:17.871
Like everyone else.

59:24.480 --> 59:25.959
Do it then.

59:29.200 --> 59:31.316
Do what you were
programed to do.

59:43.280 --> 59:44.508
What is that?

59:56.560 --> 59:58.152
What is that?

59:59.680 --> 01:00:03.753
I can't remember,
but I am haunted by it.

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:06.433
Do you see it?

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:12.920
Togusa!

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:22.312
Don't take the medication
that they give you.

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:25.713
They use it to suppress
your memories.

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:30.028
Your shell belongs to them,
but not your ghost.

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:32.358
Your ghost is yours.

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:34.313
Remember that,

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:37.557
and maybe you can remember it all.

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:48.354
Get away from her!
Get down on the ground, now!

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:55.548
Major!

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:05.833
Major!

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:25.912
Oh, Mira.

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:28.476
Oh, my God, you're safe!

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:32.749
You've been gone for hours!

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:36.109
No one knew where you were.

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.189
What?

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:46.112
You're scaring me.

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:50.439
Calm down.

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:56.835
How many were there before me?

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:03.758
The intricacies of shelling your mind,
it had never been done before.

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:06.515
It was inevitable
there would be failures.

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:09.393
How many?

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:14.879
Dozens.

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:21.159
How many?

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:27.917
Ninety-eight unsuccessful attempts
before you.

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.675
You killed 98 innocent people.

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:35.228
No, I didn't kill anyone.

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.750
You wouldn't be here.
You wouldn't exist

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:40.751
if it weren't for
those experiments.

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:42.598
"Experiments"?

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:46.749
- Is that what I am to you?
- No!

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:50.433
No, Mira!

01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:57.831
Sacrifices were made.

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:02.589
Where did the bodies come from?

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:06.557
Where did I come from?

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:10.031
Mr. Cutter brought them to us.

01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:12.357
I didn't ask questions.

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:13.953
The harbor!

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:16.199
My parents.

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:18.552
The way they died.

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:22.152
Did that happen?

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:26.349
No.

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:31.868
We gave you false memories.

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:34.872
Cutter wanted to motivate you

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:36.593
to fight terrorists.

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:37.874
I didn't approve.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.595
It was cruel, but my work,
it was important,

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:43.912
and you were born.

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:47.071
You were so beautiful.

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:51.913
Nothing I have is real.

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:55.913
I found him.

01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.239
I told you to be careful.

01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:01.358
You knew who he was
the whole time.

01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:02.799
You built him.

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:08.636
He had a violent, unstable mind.

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:11.960
His cerebral connections
wouldn't hold!

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:14.270
- I tried to save him!
- No.

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:17.037
You left him to die.

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:29.678
Nothing on Kuze yet, sir.

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:31.518
Checking upper zones next.

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.791
Is there any word on Major?

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:42.358
Copy that, sir.

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:44.951
I know where to find her.

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:30.551
I didn't ask you to come here.

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:33.353
You never ask.

01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:35.358
But I always do.

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.758
Did they send you to bring me in?

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:46.193
I'm just here to fish.
Did you see any?

01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:48.636
You're a company man.
You follow orders,

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:50.711
so if they ordered you
to kill me...

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:53.991
Stop saying shit like that.
You're gonna piss me off.

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:18.995
What's it like down there?

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:21.751
It's cold and dark.

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:25.270
Just a million miles away.

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:28.073
No voices.

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:30.712
No data streaming.

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:33.188
Just

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:37.480
nothing.

01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:44.872
- It scares me.
- Then why do you do it?

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:53.951
It feels real.

01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:56.237
Why didn't you stop him?

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:01.711
I don't know who to trust anymore.

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:04.273
You trust me, right?

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:10.349
Yeah, I do.

01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:15.437
I just don't like it.

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:25.079
I need you to take me back.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.831
There's more I need to find out.

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:33.635
Sure.

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:53.352
Dr. Ouelet,

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.956
what have you told her?

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.353
She knows.

01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:02.238
I'm bringing her in.

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:35.076
Hanka Security
to headquarters.

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:37.598
We have the Major.

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:16.232
Why is she sedated?

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:19.274
She's been turned by a terrorist.

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:22.196
But you know that already.

01:09:24.479 --> 01:09:28.154
You should've called the first time
she came to see you.

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:30.238
Instead, you gave her information.

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:32.515
What makes you think
you have the right to tell me

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.830
- what to do and what...
- 2571 took us close.

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:36.997
It's time to move on
to the next iteration.

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:38.513
2571 is not a failure.

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:40.750
I'll delete all the data
and reprogram her.

01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:42.353
She won't remember him at all!

01:09:42.439 --> 01:09:43.997
No. No, no, no.

01:09:44.359 --> 01:09:47.352
You download all the data
on the terrorist,

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:49.908
and then I order you to terminate.

01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:54.274
What?

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:56.914
You'll build one that's better.

01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:00.432
- I'll delete everything.
- You've deleted before.

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:05.911
- She's mine.
- No.

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:08.469
She's a contract. With me.

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:10.238
We succeeded.

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:13.796
She's more than human
and more than A.I.

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:16.834
We changed her entire identity.

01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:18.512
But her ghost survived!

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:20.875
Her ghost is what failed us.

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:22.878
We cannot control her.

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:24.757
She's no longer a viable asset.

01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:32.633
You should be the one to do it.

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:44.231
What are you doing to me?

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.036
I'll run the standard synaptic,

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:50.839
upload your data on the raid,

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:53.790
find out exactly
what Kuze told you.

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:57.670
You know what he told me.

01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:59.313
The truth.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.434
You're deleting everything,
aren't you?

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:06.669
No.

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:11.317
Make it so I don't remember

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:13.269
you.

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:25.313
My name is Major Mira Killian,

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.549
and I do not consent
to the deletion of this data.

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:33.788
I do not consent.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.309
I do not consent.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.309
We never needed your consent.

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:47.157
Yours or anyone's.

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:53.836
You're killing me,

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.513
aren't you?

01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:17.075
Mira?

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:20.919
You hear me?

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:25.715
Mira?

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:31.998
This is your past,
your real past. Take it.

01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:35.150
- Guards!
- Come on, come on!

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:36.559
Come on, go!

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:44.760
Go.

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:46.315
Go!

01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:47.560
Hey!

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:55.958
Please relocate
to your designated safe room.

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:59.159
Security alert on level 25.

01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:02.635
Initiating lockdown procedure.

01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:05.554
Please relocate
to your designated safe room.

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:07.471
Thank you
for your cooperation.

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:13.359
That's the problem
with the human heart.

01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:57.951
She killed Dr. Ouelet!

01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:00.076
You're to have
no further contact with her.

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:01.752
Hanka Security
will hunt her from here.

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:04.229
- What are their orders?
- To terminate on sight.

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:06.197
You want to kill her?
You built her!

01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:07.588
Have your sergeant stand down.

01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:09.636
The Major would
never harm Dr. Ouelet!

01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:11.438
She's not the Major anymore!

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:14.911
We have a Section 9 operative
under terrorist programing.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.719
This goes public,
your unit goes down.

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:25.235
I'll take that under advisement.

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:30.432
So what now?

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:24.273
Hey. Hey.

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:26.231
Oh, Pumpkin!

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:29.115
Oh, you surprised me.

01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:31.349
Ooh.

01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:33.631
She likes you.

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:36.312
I was looking for, um...

01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:37.708
Come in.

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:40.158
Yeah, come, come.

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:47.234
Can I offer you some tea?

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:49.069
- Okay.
- Uh-huh.

01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:01.919
That's Motoko's room.

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:06.351
My daughter died a year ago.

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:09.114
I'm sorry.

01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:11.311
She ran away.

01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:13.951
She was difficult.

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:18.632
And, uh, we fought.

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:23.555
But I guess we all fight
with our parents, right?

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.752
Please come and sit, yeah?

01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:49.113
What happened to her?

01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:52.196
I don't know.

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:58.353
The ministry sent me her ashes,

01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:02.398
and they told me
she took her own life.

01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:08.836
But, Motoko...
No, no, no.

01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:12.152
I never believed them.

01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:14.711
She was happy,

01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:18.555
living in the lawless zone
with her friends.

01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:22.715
She'd write her manifestos about

01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:28.429
how technology was
destroying the world.

01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:32.397
Then, one day,

01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:34.994
the police came,

01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:36.559
and they ran.

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:46.517
It's strange.

01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:56.828
I see her
in so many young women.

01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:00.910
On the street,
in my dreams.

01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:04.193
As if she's still here.

01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:06.719
She was

01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:09.073
fearless!

01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:13.472
And wild.

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:16.588
You remind me of her.

01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:19.274
Sorry.

01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:25.915
How do I remind you of her?

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:30.234
The way you look at me.

01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:37.679
Who are you?

01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:42.792
I don't know.

01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:45.792
Wait, wait, wait!

01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:50.314
Will you come again to visit me?

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:53.354
I will.

01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:21.238
Aramaki.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.353
Listen to me.

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:26.115
I was never in a terrorist bombing.

01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:27.873
My parents,

01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:31.313
everything was data
they installed in my mind.

01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:34.750
And there were others.

01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:36.671
Runaways like me

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:39.351
considered disposable.

01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:42.832
Kuze was one of them.
That's why he's coming.

01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:45.199
For Hanka.

01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:50.597
Dr. Ouelet can.

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:06.519
Put me on the grid.

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:07.828
I need Kuze to find me.

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:14.395
I know.
But I need to do this.

01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:31.316
The virus has spread.

01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:07.829
Shh.

01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:02.396
We've located Major on the grid.

01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:04.072
She's in the lawless zone.

01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:06.276
Air support five minutes out.

01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:09.348
Is the spider tank within range?

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.275
Yes, sir.
Awaiting your orders, sir.

01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:17.668
Hideo!

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:19.472
Motoko!

01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:29.598
It is real.

01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:34.911
This place.

01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:45.034
I remember what they did to us.

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:47.754
Cutter and his men.

01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:49.916
This is where they took us from.

01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:58.558
We used to sleep right here.

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:02.436
We were like a family,

01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:04.551
all of us runaways.

01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:07.752
We had nothing,

01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:13.352
except each other.

01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:19.549
They took that from us.

01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:37.676
Your name was Hideo.

01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:50.279
Motoko.

01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:54.757
That was your name.

01:26:58.280 --> 01:26:59.633
Motoko.

01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:04.913
Come with me

01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:08.151
into my network.

01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:11.474
We will evolve beyond them.

01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:16.790
And together, we can avenge
what they have done to us.

01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:18.315
Come

01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:20.318
with me.

01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:39.991
I'll take control from here.

01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:42.196
Weapons system manual command.

01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:45.829
Spider tank now active.

01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:56.796
It's Cutter! He found us!

01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:36.313
Target acquired.

01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:39.634
No!

01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:50.951
Target eliminated.

01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:08.716
You came close,

01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:10.159
you freak.

01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:44.954
Motor center compromised.

01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:30.077
Sniper team on site?

01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:32.709
We're approaching
the targets now, sir.

01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:36.758
Come with me.

01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:41.356
There is no place for us here.

01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:47.075
No.

01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:55.075
I'm not ready to leave.

01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:58.392
I belong here.

01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:04.953
I will always be there with you

01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:07.671
in your ghost.

01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:15.589
Target is in view.

01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:17.359
What are you waiting for?

01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:18.440
Do it!

01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:22.439
No!

01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:24.633
Keep firing.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.069
Hey.

01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:00.389
Hey.

01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:06.471
Say something nice.

01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:09.678
What's your name?

01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:13.395
Aramaki told me
you had a name from before.

01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:19.038
Motoko.

01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:25.876
Major is still in there, right?

01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:29.074
I am.

01:33:57.200 --> 01:33:59.350
I thought
that it might be you.

01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:26.315
Please.

01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:36.910
Tell him this is justice.

01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:39.431
It's what I was built for.

01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:45.472
My name is Major,

01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:48.156
and I give my consent.

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:01.880
You don't have to come here anymore.

01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:05.793
I know.

01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:43.158
My mind is human.

01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:46.716
My body is manufactured.

01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:50.796
I'm the first of my kind,

01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:54.391
but I won't be the last.

01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:01.910
We cling to memories
as if they define us.

01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:06.158
But what we do defines us.

01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:15.716
My ghost survived
to remind the next of us

01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:19.751
that humanity is our virtue.

01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:23.551
I know who I am

01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:26.390
and what I'm here to do.
