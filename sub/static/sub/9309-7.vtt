No.

01:27.151 --> 01:28.067

01:29.737 --> 01:32.187
No, mom.

<i>En garde.</i>

01:35.993 --> 01:37.576
You do know I carry a gun.

01:37.611 --> 01:39.111
- Aha!
- Don't touch! Don't.

01:39.163 --> 01:41.530
- Come on. Give me your jacket.
- Stop it.

01:41.582 --> 01:44.833
Hey, you two, knock it off.
Somebody's gonna get hurt.

01:44.869 --> 01:46.585
She started it.

01:46.620 --> 01:50.089
Well, she can't go to work
with whatever that is all over her.

01:50.124 --> 01:52.458
I was gonna shake it off
once I got to the office.

01:52.510 --> 01:53.542
Give it here.

01:53.594 --> 01:55.794

- Come on.

[growls]

02:01.018 --> 02:02.968
Okay, what is that?

02:03.020 --> 02:07.022
Looks like low-grade foam rubber,

02:07.057 --> 02:08.890
the kind used in
inexpensive throw pillows,

02:08.893 --> 02:11.026

02:11.061 --> 02:12.778
It's from my couch.

02:14.899 --> 02:16.732
What?
The duct tape came loose.

02:16.734 --> 02:19.902
- Duct tape?
- Yeah. Greeks use windex.

02:19.904 --> 02:22.487
Rizzolis use duct tape.

02:22.907 --> 02:25.173
It has a hole in it.

02:25.743 --> 02:27.626
Do you have anything to eat?

02:27.661 --> 02:30.662
Why does your couch have a hole
in it covered with duct tape?

02:30.714 --> 02:32.631
And how have I not noticed it?

02:32.666 --> 02:36.635
Because I... cover it with a pillow.

02:38.139 --> 02:39.805
Joe Friday did it.
[scoffs]

02:39.840 --> 02:41.890
I'm lucky that Korsak found her owners

02:41.926 --> 02:45.594
- before she ate the entire couch.
- Don't blame Addie.

02:45.596 --> 02:46.979
It's not her fault
that your couch tastes

02:47.014 --> 02:49.982
like Frank and beans.
[laughs]

02:50.017 --> 02:52.734
My couch doesn't taste like Frank ...

02:52.770 --> 02:54.653
Wait a minute. How do you
know that Joe Friday's owner

02:54.688 --> 02:57.272
- has changed her name to Addie?
- I skype with her family.

02:59.577 --> 03:03.495
You skype... with her family?

03:03.531 --> 03:06.615
Her real name was Addie
before she got lost.

03:06.667 --> 03:08.951
<i>Okay, I think the more
important question here is</i>

03:08.953 --> 03:11.203
why haven't you replaced your couch?

03:11.255 --> 03:14.923
- The dog's been gone over a year.
- I like my couch. What is this?

03:14.959 --> 03:17.926
Your couch has a hole in it
covered with duct tape.

03:17.962 --> 03:19.962
It's an African horned cucumber.

03:19.964 --> 03:21.630
- Can you eat it?
- Of course.

03:21.682 --> 03:23.682
Tastes like a banana.
You need a new one.

03:23.717 --> 03:25.801
- Do you have one?
- A new couch?

03:25.853 --> 03:27.636
No. A banana...
[cellphone vibrating]

03:27.638 --> 03:30.222

04:03.757 --> 04:05.591
Think of it as a health issue.

04:08.178 --> 04:10.929

Aah! Right now I'm worried
about catching malaria.

04:16.185 --> 04:18.838
Oh, don't be.
There hasn't been an outbreak

04:18.839 --> 04:21.773
of locally contracted malaria
since 1931,

04:21.825 --> 04:23.609
although there have
been recent outbreaks

04:23.661 --> 04:25.193
of equine encephalitis.

04:27.865 --> 04:30.032
But ... you really
aren't human, are you?

04:30.034 --> 04:32.834
Well, some people have a genetic

04:32.870 --> 04:34.369
I don't.

04:42.880 --> 04:44.296

[chuckles]

04:46.884 --> 04:48.300
[scoffs]
What do we got?

04:48.352 --> 04:51.970
White female. Probably a teenager.

04:52.022 --> 04:55.974
- We got a name?
- No backpack. No pocketbook. No I.D.

04:56.026 --> 04:58.644
But her clothes are new, so
I don't think she's homeless.

04:58.696 --> 05:00.862
This isn't a body dump.

05:00.898 --> 05:02.948
Crate was camouflaged
so it would blend in.

05:02.983 --> 05:05.901
No sign of a struggle.
No blood spatter in the immediate area.

05:05.903 --> 05:07.402
And there are no drag marks,

05:07.404 --> 05:09.905
so she was carried here,
but not in the cage.

05:09.957 --> 05:11.239
[sighs]

05:11.241 --> 05:12.908
Maybe she was attacked

Well, there are signs of lividity
but lack of rigor mortis.

05:21.919 --> 05:23.418
I'd say less than five hours ago.

05:23.420 --> 05:26.888
No obvious signs of injury or trauma
that would account for death.

05:26.924 --> 05:28.256

<i>Okay. I'll do a DNA test

05:31.178 --> 05:33.011

that belongs to the killer

- And human testing.
- ...I saw a UFO.

Well, I-I blurted.

06:17.391 --> 06:19.274
Yeah, I blurt sometimes.
It's a problem.

06:19.309 --> 06:20.543
- Hm.
- Hey, you want to,

06:20.544 --> 06:23.145
uh, talk about the case?
[computer beeps]

06:23.147 --> 06:24.446

- X-rays?

07:05.989 --> 07:08.523
Oh, just a few options
for your new couch color.

07:09.827 --> 07:12.360
My favorite couch color? Huh...
Let me think.

07:12.413 --> 07:14.329
The lavender.

07:14.364 --> 07:17.199
No, no, no. Wait. Wait. Wait.
The cranberry.

07:18.285 --> 07:20.202
Or the color of the couch I have now.

07:20.204 --> 07:22.231
I'm trying to be a good friend.

07:22.840 --> 07:28.126
Yes, I know. But my couch
is like an old, good friend,

07:28.178 --> 07:30.545
and I wouldn't trade an old, good friend

07:30.547 --> 07:35.350
for a... new, old, good friend.

07:35.385 --> 07:37.185
Okay, you have a birthday coming up.

07:37.221 --> 07:39.137
Wouldn't it be nice to just
get something you really want?

07:39.189 --> 07:41.899
I really want a cause of death.

07:42.392 --> 07:44.359
[sighs]

07:48.565 --> 07:51.450
- Uh-huh.
- What? What are you looking at?

07:51.485 --> 07:55.153
Osteopenia.
It's a loss of calcium in the bones.

07:55.205 --> 07:58.039
Well, she's a little
young for that, isn't she?

07:58.075 --> 08:01.209
In a person of her age,
it typically results from anorexia.

08:01.245 --> 08:04.412
- Well, that's not what killed her.
- No, it didn't.

08:04.465 --> 08:07.282
But I also found this...

08:07.386 --> 08:10.085
a puncture wound from
a small-gauge needle.

08:10.137 --> 08:12.921
So she was injected
with a fatal overdose.

08:12.923 --> 08:17.142
Well, given the lack of
restraint marks or bruising,

08:17.177 --> 08:19.227
I'd say we're looking
at a fast-acting drug

08:19.263 --> 08:21.596
that could be administered
intramuscularly.

08:21.598 --> 08:25.433
So, she was drugged,
carried back to the cage.

08:25.486 --> 08:28.520
There's no indication of
rape or other sexual assault.

08:28.572 --> 08:32.524
What about the hair and blood
that we found inside the cage?

08:32.576 --> 08:36.278
It was animal blood.
We're processing it for DNA now.

08:36.280 --> 08:37.529
The hair fibers, however,

08:37.581 --> 08:40.999
came from a raccoon,
a dog, and a squirrel.

08:41.034 --> 08:43.284
Is there any way to tell what
order they went into the cage?

08:43.287 --> 08:45.120
Several samples overlapped.

08:45.122 --> 08:48.006
I think the squirrel came
first, then the raccoon.

08:48.041 --> 08:50.876
- The dog was last.
- A bigger animal each time.

08:50.928 --> 08:54.513
He was practicing...
getting ready for a human.

09:08.989 --> 09:10.989

09:13.210 --> 09:15.160

through a day like this?

09:15.212 --> 09:17.579
Right now they're on autopilot.

09:17.631 --> 09:20.832
The worst day is coming ...
the day the shock wears off

09:20.884 --> 09:24.336
and they know their
little girl is really gone.

09:24.338 --> 09:26.338
What did you learn from Sheila's school?

09:26.340 --> 09:29.841
Well, the guidance counselor says Sheila
was an all-around good kid ...

09:29.893 --> 09:32.677
top of her class academically,
no disciplinary issues.

09:32.729 --> 09:34.763
She was a mentor to
the incoming freshmen

09:34.815 --> 09:36.932
and a peer counselor
for the younger girls.

09:36.984 --> 09:39.360
Maura found evidence of
anorexia. Mom and pop said

09:39.361 --> 09:41.736
she was treated for it
starting in her freshman year.

09:41.772 --> 09:43.688
And it sounds like she
was paying it forward.

09:43.740 --> 09:45.190
What about boyfriend issues?

09:45.242 --> 09:46.992
From what the guidance
counselor told me,

09:47.027 --> 09:48.660
these kids don't really date.

09:48.695 --> 09:51.029
They do things as a group,
kind of all hang out together.

09:51.031 --> 09:53.164
- You believe that?
- I do.

09:53.200 --> 09:56.091
Well, maybe one of them knows about
Sheila's movements that morning.

09:56.126 --> 09:58.370
Two girlfriends walked with
her as far as the bus stop.

09:58.372 --> 10:01.206
Then they got on the
40 bus to Forest Hills,

10:01.258 --> 10:04.092
and Sheila took her usual route
along the walking path to her school.

10:04.127 --> 10:07.045
So now we know why she was in the woods.

10:07.097 --> 10:09.848
Doesn't explain what she
was doing in a damn cage.

10:09.883 --> 10:13.768
Well, Nina submitted the case to vicap
for crimes with similar M.O.s.

10:13.804 --> 10:15.623
Maybe we'll get lucky.

10:16.640 --> 10:18.838

don't you go home and rest?

10:28.201 --> 10:29.868
[sighs]
Can't.

10:29.903 --> 10:32.287
[groans]
Not until I find something,

10:32.322 --> 10:35.290
anything, that will
move this case forward.

10:36.376 --> 10:40.795
Well, I have a preliminary tox screen.

10:40.831 --> 10:43.415
- For real? [sighs]
- Mm-hmm.

10:45.252 --> 10:48.053
Negative for heroin,
cocaine, and marijuana.

10:48.088 --> 10:52.390
Great. That leaves only
7 million other drugs

10:52.426 --> 10:55.393
- that could have been given to her.
- On the bright side,

10:55.429 --> 10:57.228
the full report should
be ready tomorrow.

10:57.264 --> 10:58.730
[sighs]
Okay.

11:00.067 --> 11:02.767
Don't you just love this color?

11:05.105 --> 11:07.355
Yes.
I love it.

11:07.407 --> 11:09.441
It looks fantastic...

11:09.443 --> 11:11.375
on you...

11:12.112 --> 11:15.947
not a couch.
[sighs]

11:15.999 --> 11:17.415
Well, I love it.

11:22.923 --> 11:25.290
Hey.
Your text said you had some info

11:25.292 --> 11:26.458
on the company who made the cage?

11:26.460 --> 11:28.760
- Galen containment vessels.
- Ah.

11:28.795 --> 11:30.895
<i>They manufacture a wide range of
animal cages... [computer beeps]</i>

11:30.931 --> 11:33.181
...from mice and rats
to larger wildlife ...

11:33.216 --> 11:35.050
wolves, coyotes, dogs, primates.

11:35.102 --> 11:37.135
They supply over two dozen vendors...

11:37.137 --> 11:39.404
<i>[computer beeps] ...who, in
turn, sell them to laboratories,</i>

11:39.439 --> 11:44.225
game wardens, and, believe it or not,
pig farmers.

11:46.046 --> 11:48.730
You know, I-I don't believe
in any of that stuff.

11:48.782 --> 11:52.951
- Pig farming?
- [chuckling] No.

11:52.986 --> 11:54.402
Not pig farming. I don't
care about pig farming.

11:54.454 --> 11:56.204
I'm talking about UFOs.

11:56.239 --> 11:59.207
I-I don't believe in
it or care about it.

11:59.242 --> 12:01.826
You know... I was just a kid.

12:01.878 --> 12:04.295
- It's stupid.
- Really?

12:04.331 --> 12:07.165
Yeah.
I mean, it was my imagination.

12:07.167 --> 12:09.751
It was probably a
blimp or a frisbee or...

12:12.472 --> 12:14.973
All right, let me know when
the list of vendors comes up.

12:15.008 --> 12:18.143
But they're right... over there.

12:20.263 --> 12:22.841
[sighs]
[silent chuckle]

12:22.876 --> 12:25.850
[horns honking]

12:25.852 --> 12:29.263
- Man: She's right in here.
- Oh, thank you.

12:29.940 --> 12:33.191
- Maura.
- Kevin Foley. [chuckles]

12:33.243 --> 12:36.194
Please come in.
Thank you.

12:36.196 --> 12:39.330
- Hello.
- Hi. [both chuckle]

12:39.366 --> 12:41.199
I-I'm ... I'm sorry to
drop in without calling.

12:41.201 --> 12:43.334
Not at all. 
It's really nice to see you.

12:43.370 --> 12:45.837
I was just making some coffee.
Would you like to join me?

12:45.872 --> 12:47.539
Oh, uh, no, no, uh...

12:47.541 --> 12:50.875
- Uh, thank you. [chuckles]
- Please.

12:50.927 --> 12:52.961
Chief medical examiner.

12:53.013 --> 12:55.930
So... interdisciplinary.
[laughs]

12:55.966 --> 12:57.382
I could never do what you do.

12:57.384 --> 12:59.434
[chuckling] Oh. You've
always been very modest.

12:59.469 --> 13:01.886
I read the Journal of
clinical psychiatry,

13:01.938 --> 13:04.939
and your innovations and applications

13:04.975 --> 13:07.392
on narrative therapy
are very impressive.

13:08.478 --> 13:10.945
Thank you.
[chuckles]

13:16.369 --> 13:20.155
- So, what brings you by?
- I was reading the Boston dispatch.

13:20.207 --> 13:21.956
I-I know it's available online,

13:21.992 --> 13:24.492
uh, but I just can't let
go of the physical paper.

13:24.544 --> 13:26.911
Oh, I know how you feel. 
[chuckles]

13:27.998 --> 13:29.297
Th-there was a, um ...

13:29.332 --> 13:32.723
a photo of you at the scene of a murder.

13:33.470 --> 13:35.086
Um...

13:38.508 --> 13:40.744
Kevin?

13:40.844 --> 13:43.261
The photo ... it ...
it ... it made me, um...

13:45.265 --> 13:49.517
I wanted to...
Well, I wanted to ask you ...

13:53.440 --> 13:54.989
<i>Oh, that poor girl.</i>

13:55.025 --> 13:57.408
She wasn't assaulted
in any way, was she?

13:59.162 --> 14:01.529
I can't discuss an open
investigation with you.

14:01.581 --> 14:03.248
Yes, of course.
Of course not.

14:03.283 --> 14:05.283
C-Could you tell me if, um...

14:06.920 --> 14:10.769
- do you have a suspect?
- Why do you want to know?

14:13.627 --> 14:17.045
Kevin, if you know anything ...

14:17.097 --> 14:18.880
I've made a terrible mistake
by coming here like this.

14:18.932 --> 14:20.298
- I ...
- No, not at all.

14:20.300 --> 14:22.600
I-I can't do this.
I'm sorry.

14:22.636 --> 14:24.219
<i>I-I-It was lovely to ...
to see you, Maura.</i>

14:24.271 --> 14:26.187
[sighs]

14:34.364 --> 14:35.897
Okay, Maura, thanks.

14:36.950 --> 14:41.486
- What's up? [cellphone beeps]
- Get this ...

14:41.538 --> 14:43.454
a friend of Maura's from med
school just dropped in on her ...

14:43.490 --> 14:44.656
guy she hasn't seen in a decade ...

14:44.658 --> 14:47.325
a psychiatrist named Dr. Kevin Foley.

14:47.327 --> 14:49.327
I have a feeling it
wasn't a social visit.

14:49.329 --> 14:50.912
No. She said he was real nervous.

14:50.964 --> 14:53.381
Then he started asking questions
about Sheila MacIntyre.

14:53.416 --> 14:56.417
Then he asked if she was assaulted
and if we had a suspect.

14:56.469 --> 14:58.336
<i>He has information about our case,</i>

14:58.338 --> 15:00.922
but he can't violate
doctor/patient confidentiality.

15:00.974 --> 15:04.309
No, but he would have known
that before he left the office.

15:04.344 --> 15:06.431
Then why bother coming?

15:08.014 --> 15:11.149
Maybe he's not asking
because of a client.

15:11.184 --> 15:13.351
Maybe it's 'cause he's
never killed anyone before

15:13.353 --> 15:15.320
and now he's nervous,
so he decides to trick

15:15.355 --> 15:18.456
an old friend into telling him
if he's about to get caught.

15:28.825 --> 15:29.941
[horn honks]

15:30.994 --> 15:33.578
[grunts]

15:33.613 --> 15:35.447
Dr. Foley? 
[car door closes]

15:35.449 --> 15:38.450
Detective Jane Rizzoli ...
Boston homicide.

15:38.452 --> 15:40.285
Dr. Isles told you about my visit.

15:40.337 --> 15:42.704
[sighs]
I have nothing to say.

15:42.756 --> 15:44.873
Well, then, why'd you go see her?

15:46.093 --> 15:48.543
Even if I wanted to, I can't help you.

15:48.595 --> 15:51.546
Listen, clearly something is
on your conscience, all right?

15:51.598 --> 15:55.467
- Please talk to me.
- I can't. Please leave me alone.

15:56.720 --> 15:57.936
Did you kill Sheila MacIntyre?

15:57.971 --> 15:59.721
[chuckling]
Me?

16:01.475 --> 16:03.558
- No, of course not.
- No?

16:03.610 --> 16:06.728
Your little animal study at BCU
giving you a taste for killing things?

16:06.780 --> 16:08.780
What? No, you can't ...
[stammers]

16:08.815 --> 16:10.448
None of those animals were ever hurt.

16:10.484 --> 16:13.884
It was a study on the
effects of companion animals.

16:14.488 --> 16:16.654
I could never hurt that girl.

16:17.707 --> 16:19.791
But you know who did, don't you?

16:23.497 --> 16:26.965
She was 16 years old, and
she was stuffed into a cage.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.934
That's a pretty horrible
way to die, don't you think?

16:31.505 --> 16:32.971
Look, if you didn't want to help,

16:33.006 --> 16:35.673
you wouldn't have gone to Maura, okay?

16:35.675 --> 16:37.342
I can promise you

16:37.344 --> 16:39.644
Sheila MacIntyre will not
be the last person to die.

16:41.148 --> 16:43.681
I need to get to my office.

16:44.935 --> 16:48.594
You need to do the right thing, doctor.

16:58.081 --> 17:01.499
So, Foley was telling the truth
about his animal studies at BCU.

17:01.535 --> 17:04.786
So the killer must be
one of Foley's patients.

17:04.838 --> 17:06.753
He wants to tell us, but he can't.

17:06.790 --> 17:09.040
<i>I hate to state the obvious,
but no judge is gonna give us</i>

17:09.092 --> 17:11.125
a warrant to go digging through
Foley's patients' records.

17:11.178 --> 17:12.926
And the surveillance
won't help us, either.

17:12.963 --> 17:14.378
<i>Too many other
businesses in the building</i>

17:14.431 --> 17:16.513
to be sure who's going in to see Foley.

17:16.550 --> 17:18.849
[groans]
You guys aren't helping.

17:21.104 --> 17:23.555
Okay, the tox report
says she was administered

17:23.607 --> 17:25.690
a fatal dose of
tiletamine and zolazepam.

17:25.724 --> 17:27.976
Those are euthanizing
agents used by veterinarians.

17:30.146 --> 17:31.946
Wait a minute. 
We can do an end run.

17:31.982 --> 17:35.483
If you check with the D.E.A.,
see who has access to those drugs,

17:35.535 --> 17:37.785
I can subpoena Foley's billing records

17:37.821 --> 17:39.487
to the insurance companies.

17:39.539 --> 17:40.989
Then Frankie can cross-reference

17:41.041 --> 17:42.707
the names we get from the
D.E.A. with the billing records.

17:42.742 --> 17:45.960
Yeah. And if Foley is treating
anyone on the D.E.A. list,

17:45.996 --> 17:47.912
that might be enough for
a judge to sign a warrant.

17:47.914 --> 17:49.581
<i>Frankie: I'll get on it</i>

17:49.583 --> 17:51.749
[sighs] Right after
I cancel the plans I had

17:51.801 --> 17:55.837
- for the rest of my life.
- We need a new angle on this.

17:59.426 --> 18:01.426
A full profile is impossible.

18:01.478 --> 18:04.095
- There's only one data point.
- No, there's two.

18:04.147 --> 18:07.599
He killed someone, and he's
probably one of Foley's patients.

18:07.601 --> 18:10.314
- Still.
- Maura, please.

18:10.362 --> 18:12.687
Anything that you got is
more than what I've got.

18:12.739 --> 18:15.573
The subject is a male.
He's an immature killer.

18:15.609 --> 18:17.775
So Sheila was probably his first kill.

18:17.827 --> 18:20.111
Yes.
He's intelligent and organized.

18:20.113 --> 18:22.780
He obtained a cage. 
He picked a hiding spot.

18:22.832 --> 18:25.867
He acquired the drugs
necessary to carry out his plan,

18:25.919 --> 18:28.753
and he selected a victim.

18:28.788 --> 18:30.788
Does the cage suggest some sort of need

18:30.790 --> 18:34.092
- for domination or something?
- No. I think it's for the ritual.

18:34.127 --> 18:36.127
The drugs he used have a side effect.

18:36.129 --> 18:37.795
When animals are injected with it,

18:37.797 --> 18:39.964
their eyes have to be taped
shut or they stay open.

18:39.966 --> 18:41.883
It's not a cage. 
It's a holding pen.

18:41.935 --> 18:44.135
He just stood there and watched
the life drain out of her eyes.

18:44.187 --> 18:48.139
- Quite possibly.
- No wonder Foley got the heebie-jeebies.

18:48.191 --> 18:51.476
- That's really all I can say.
- You sure?

18:51.528 --> 18:53.645
- Yes.
- Really? Nothing?

18:53.647 --> 18:56.030
You don't want to, like, ask
me something about a couch,

18:56.066 --> 18:59.484
maybe pitch a color or a texture or...

18:59.486 --> 19:01.569
curly something? 
[cellphone vibrating]

19:01.621 --> 19:04.238
- [chuckling] No.
- Hey, Mom. What's up?

19:05.492 --> 19:08.493
Yeah, okay. I'll be right there.

19:08.545 --> 19:09.627
[cellphone beeps]

19:09.663 --> 19:11.045
See you later.

19:15.669 --> 19:16.801
[indistinct conversations]

19:16.836 --> 19:17.969
[mid-tempo music plays]

19:20.924 --> 19:22.173
Hi, Mom. What's up?

19:22.175 --> 19:26.144
Hi. I was worried about you.
You need to eat something.

19:26.179 --> 19:28.513
And these are your favorites.

19:31.768 --> 19:36.505
These are not my favorite.
These are not even napkins.

19:36.506 --> 19:39.741
They're fabric swatch...
Ma [scoffs]

19:39.776 --> 19:41.109
I can't believe you called
me in to do this right now.

19:41.161 --> 19:43.695
Come on. Maura wants to
do something nice for you.

19:43.697 --> 19:46.080
Fine. Uh...

19:46.116 --> 19:47.532
I've made a decision.

19:49.002 --> 19:52.704
Toasted walnut pearl?

19:52.706 --> 19:55.206
- Corinthian coral?
- I like my couch.

19:55.258 --> 19:57.959
That's my decision, okay?

19:58.011 --> 20:01.212
I don't want a gift
couch with obligations.

20:01.214 --> 20:05.633
Maura's not giving you a gift
with obligations attached to it.

20:05.685 --> 20:07.635
[cellphone beeps]
Really?

20:07.687 --> 20:09.220
- Are you calling her?
- Of course.

20:09.272 --> 20:11.723
- Maura: Hi, Jane.
- Hey.

20:11.725 --> 20:13.725
<i>Um, question ...</i>

20:13.727 --> 20:17.812
What would you do if I
dropped a piece of pizza

20:17.864 --> 20:20.732
on this gift couch
you were gonna give me?

20:20.734 --> 20:23.868
Well, that's not even a challenge.
I'd take a bit of baking soda.

20:23.903 --> 20:25.319
I would sprinkle it on the stain.

20:25.372 --> 20:28.239
<i>I'd make sure the stain
was completely covered.</i>

20:28.291 --> 20:30.575
<i>Then you allow the baking
soda to absorb the grease</i>

20:30.627 --> 20:33.127
from the upholstery
for 15 to 20 minutes.

20:33.163 --> 20:38.332
Okay, that's 15 to 20 too long.
I have a three-step process.

20:38.385 --> 20:40.885
I would pick up the pizza,
I would eat the pizza,

20:40.920 --> 20:43.137
and then I would dab the
spot with a paper towel.

20:43.173 --> 20:45.256
But that's unsanitary.

20:45.308 --> 20:49.205
Especially if you drop
food on a regular basis.

20:49.312 --> 20:52.730
<i>I like my couch.</i>

20:52.766 --> 20:54.899
No new couch.
[cellphone vibrates]

20:54.934 --> 20:56.901
I got to go.
[cellphone beeps]

20:56.936 --> 20:58.603
Rizzoli.

20:58.655 --> 21:02.857
Uh, yes, Dr. Foley.
3:15 would be fine.

21:02.909 --> 21:05.777
Thank you.
[cellphone beeps]

21:07.080 --> 21:09.513
These are all disgusting.

21:15.171 --> 21:18.206
We don't want to disturb Dr. Foley
if he's with a client,

21:18.258 --> 21:19.924
but he did ask us to be here at 3:15.

21:21.127 --> 21:24.070
I don't see anything
entered into his calendar for

21:24.071 --> 21:27.014
this afternoon, but sometimes
doctors forget to enter

21:27.050 --> 21:29.801
<i>their last-minute appointments.</i>

21:34.641 --> 21:36.190
Dr. Foley?

21:38.895 --> 21:42.647
Hmm. That's odd.
If the red light is on,

21:42.649 --> 21:43.948
he should be in there with a client.

21:45.068 --> 21:48.402
Um, would you mind stepping
over here for a second, please?

21:51.324 --> 21:54.242
Dr. Foley?

21:55.328 --> 21:56.661
[door opens]

22:07.056 --> 22:08.673
He's dead.

22:08.675 --> 22:10.341
[thump, creak]

22:27.160 --> 22:29.694
Please don't hurt me.

22:41.044 --> 22:43.794
[police radio chatter,
camera shutter clicking]

22:43.830 --> 22:45.263
He tell you what happened?

22:45.298 --> 22:46.998
No. All I got was his
name ... Daniel o'Neill ...

22:47.033 --> 22:49.800
his age ... 16 years ...
and a request to call his parents.

22:49.836 --> 22:51.719
Paramedics clear him for travel?

22:51.754 --> 22:54.839
Yeah. Couple of uniforms
are taking him down to H.Q.

22:54.891 --> 22:57.008
Foley told us to be here at 3:15 ...

22:57.010 --> 23:00.177
- while Daniel was still here.
- Wanted us to get a look at the kid,

23:00.179 --> 23:02.063
see if we could figure out
his connection to the murder?

23:02.098 --> 23:04.954
He had to have told
Daniel that we were coming.

23:05.985 --> 23:07.184
I bet he wanted Daniel
to turn himself in.

23:07.186 --> 23:09.448
Well, that didn't work out as planned.

23:09.656 --> 23:11.822
[alarm blaring]

23:11.858 --> 23:13.157
[blaring stops]
Panic button.

23:13.192 --> 23:14.942
You can hear that all
the way down the hall.

23:14.994 --> 23:16.744
Well, it only works
if you can get to it.

23:16.779 --> 23:19.489
The blood spatter on
his clothes places Daniel

23:19.490 --> 23:22.199
directly in front of Dr.
Foley when he was stabbed.

23:22.252 --> 23:24.785
- So, Daniel killed him.
- I can't say that.

23:24.837 --> 23:25.836
Did you ever play "Clue"?

23:26.839 --> 23:28.789
Two people in a room. 
One person's dead.

23:28.841 --> 23:30.841
The other person's covered
in blood. Who's the murderer?

23:30.877 --> 23:32.543
Well, I think it's the person

23:32.545 --> 23:34.345
that left their fingerprints
on the murder weapon.

23:40.270 --> 23:42.937
You know, about that UFO stuff ...

23:42.972 --> 23:45.056
I'm not surprised you saw
a UFO when you were a kid.

23:45.108 --> 23:47.558
You're not? Why?

23:47.610 --> 23:49.860
<i>Nina: There have been 13
recorded UFO sightings in Boston</i>

23:49.896 --> 23:51.112
in the last two years alone.

23:51.147 --> 23:52.697
- I don't know.
- I'm telling you.

23:52.732 --> 23:53.898
What? You don't know what?

23:54.984 --> 23:56.867
I was just asking
Frankie if the restaurant

23:56.903 --> 23:59.704
at the top of the Prudential Center
really turns around.

23:59.739 --> 24:02.957
It doesn't.
What do we know about Daniel?

24:02.992 --> 24:04.959
Uh, he's been homeschooled
since the 5th grade,

24:04.994 --> 24:07.745
but he finished in the top
1% of his high-school class

24:07.747 --> 24:09.714
on the district's standardized tests.

24:09.749 --> 24:14.173
- When did he start seeing Dr. Foley?
- About six months ago.

24:14.304 --> 24:17.805
- All right, call me if you get anything else.
- Sure thing.

24:17.840 --> 24:21.592
Oh.
Prints on the letter opener are Daniel's.

24:21.594 --> 24:23.943
Let's see what he has to say about that.

24:24.981 --> 24:26.764
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

24:26.816 --> 24:28.733
<i>I never should have let you
talk me into taking him there.</i>

24:28.768 --> 24:30.101
<i>You went along with it. 
You knew ...</i>

24:30.153 --> 24:31.602
<i>There is absolutely
nothing wrong with him.</i>

24:31.604 --> 24:33.691
<i>Boys will be boys.
[door opens]</i>

24:36.075 --> 24:40.695
Mr. and Mrs. o'Neill,
I'm Detective Jane Rizzoli. [sighs]

24:40.747 --> 24:42.747
Obviously, we understand
how hard this is

24:42.782 --> 24:44.365
for all of you, Daniel especially.

24:47.286 --> 24:49.286
I don't want to talk about it.

24:49.288 --> 24:51.872
I can understand that,
but I think it's important

24:51.924 --> 24:53.841
that you tell us what happened today.

24:53.876 --> 24:56.177
Anything to tie this kid
to the MacIntyre murder?

24:56.212 --> 24:58.846
Not yet, Ernie.
But we've got plenty of evidence

24:58.881 --> 25:00.297
that makes him good for Foley's murder,

25:00.350 --> 25:02.133
including his fingerprints
on the murder weapon.

25:02.185 --> 25:04.802
<i>Mrs. o'Neill: I don't know
what you expect him to say.</i>

25:04.804 --> 25:06.303
The truth.

25:06.356 --> 25:08.055
<i>Mr. o'Neill: Witnessing
something like he did ...</i>

25:08.107 --> 25:10.564
he's supposed to get over that?

25:11.361 --> 25:15.704
Daniel, why don't you tell your
parents what really happened today.

25:15.739 --> 25:18.032
<i>What the hell are you talking about?
What are you saying?</i>

25:19.118 --> 25:21.652
The physical evidence proves

25:21.704 --> 25:26.209
that it was Daniel
who stabbed Dr. Foley.

25:33.249 --> 25:34.799
Daniel, what were you

25:34.834 --> 25:36.967
<i>and Dr. Foley talking about recently?</i>

25:38.004 --> 25:39.387
I don't know.

25:40.973 --> 25:42.173
Stuff.

25:43.226 --> 25:45.092
Why were you
in Dr. Foley's office today?

25:47.847 --> 25:49.346
Just a regular appointment.

25:49.399 --> 25:52.155
Your regular appointments
are on Thursdays.

25:52.268 --> 25:53.434
Yeah.

25:56.189 --> 26:01.325
- He... He asked me to come in.
- Did he say why?

26:04.363 --> 26:06.330
[sobs quietly]

26:06.365 --> 26:07.865
Daniel.

26:15.291 --> 26:17.958
Why were you
in Dr. Foley's office today?

26:23.049 --> 26:28.769
He was molesting me, and I
was gonna tell. [sniffles]

26:31.441 --> 26:32.890
He's lying.

26:32.942 --> 26:34.859
- You got any proof of that?
- No.

26:34.894 --> 26:36.227
Look, I'm not saying Daniel
didn't kill Dr. Foley,

26:36.229 --> 26:39.947
but look at him.
Right now, a jury is gonna see that kid,

26:39.982 --> 26:43.489
a kid who was defending himself
against a sexual predator. [door opens]

26:45.037 --> 26:47.375
He's not going forward with this.

26:48.074 --> 26:50.040
That little shit
killed Sheila MacIntyre.

26:50.076 --> 26:52.409
- I know it.
- But you can't prove it.

26:52.411 --> 26:55.162
No, but Dr. Foley could.
And he was gonna turn him over to us.

26:55.214 --> 26:56.497
Get a subpoena for his records.

26:56.549 --> 26:58.382
Nothing that kid says
to his psychiatrist

26:58.417 --> 27:00.251
will see the light
of day in a courtroom.

27:00.253 --> 27:03.254
No, but he just opened that door for us
by accusing Foley of molesting him.

27:03.256 --> 27:07.104
That might work.
You should have gone to law school.

27:07.139 --> 27:09.661
- We can hold him?
- Yes, when the records tie him

27:09.662 --> 27:10.761
to the MacIntyre girl's murder.

27:10.813 --> 27:12.930
Until then, Foley's
death is self-defense.

27:12.932 --> 27:16.867
Daniel o'Neill gets
released to his parents.

27:17.570 --> 27:20.521
[door opens]

27:21.440 --> 27:22.490
[door closes]

27:44.897 --> 27:48.215
Six months of therapy ...
there's not a single note

27:48.250 --> 27:51.051
about murder, violence,
or anger towards women.

27:51.086 --> 27:52.919
What the hell was Dr. Foley
so worried about?

27:52.971 --> 27:54.488
<i>[stammers]
Maura: I got your message.</i>

27:54.523 --> 27:57.090
- What do you need?
- Pretzels.

27:59.261 --> 28:02.345
- From your vending machine.
- [chuckles] I...

28:02.397 --> 28:03.563
Well, you didn't say ...

28:03.599 --> 28:07.517
- D-Do you really want pretzels?
- No. I really want to know

28:07.569 --> 28:10.103
why Daniel o'Neill's
therapy file is so unhelpful.

28:10.105 --> 28:12.606
- Well, you knew Dr. Foley.
- A long time ago.

28:12.608 --> 28:16.943
Okay, well, did he have some
weird note-taking system, then?

28:16.995 --> 28:20.363
I mean, we've looked
for audio files, iclouds,

28:20.415 --> 28:22.332
receipts for off-site storage.

28:22.367 --> 28:25.335
- These are session notes.
- Yes.

28:25.370 --> 28:27.876
So, where are Daniel's narratives?

28:28.624 --> 28:32.209
- Narratives?
- Foley practiced narrative therapy.

28:32.261 --> 28:34.377
The client writes or
talks about his life

28:34.429 --> 28:36.630
as it is or as he wishes it would be.

28:36.632 --> 28:40.183
So, I would expect to see at
least one of those in the file.

28:40.219 --> 28:42.636
Well, we didn't get anything
like that from Mrs. Lewis.

28:42.688 --> 28:45.272
She didn't strike me as someone
who would misplace files.

28:45.307 --> 28:47.524
No.

28:47.559 --> 28:49.142
Daniel took them.

28:50.445 --> 28:52.145
Well, they weren't on
him after the murder.

28:52.147 --> 28:55.448
- I searched all of his clothes.
- They weren't in Dr. Foley's desk.

28:56.785 --> 28:58.652
What if he put them in
the other patients' files?

28:58.704 --> 29:01.154
He knows we can't get in there.
That's client confidentiality.

29:01.156 --> 29:04.457
I'll see if I can convince Mrs. Lewis
to look through everything.

29:06.161 --> 29:07.494
Interesting.

29:07.546 --> 29:09.996
Daniel's only real
passion was volunteering

29:09.998 --> 29:12.215
at the Composer Hill animal shelter.

29:12.251 --> 29:14.334
That's a perfect place
for him to have access

29:14.386 --> 29:15.585
to the drugs and the cage.

29:17.172 --> 29:19.335
I think I need to adopt a new dog.

29:23.011 --> 29:24.561
I've complied with the subpoena.

29:24.596 --> 29:26.763
You have everything in
the o'Neill boy's file.

29:26.815 --> 29:30.016
I know, but it appears as though
some pages might be missing ...

29:30.068 --> 29:32.269
- the narratives?
- I'm sorry, sergeant.

29:32.321 --> 29:34.404
I don't know anything about that.

29:34.439 --> 29:38.158
Well, what if they were
accidentally misfiled by Dr. Foley?

29:38.193 --> 29:40.327
Or intentionally misfiled
by Daniel o'Neill?

29:40.362 --> 29:44.364
- That would be highly unlikely.
- But what if he did...

29:44.366 --> 29:46.700
<i>and all those files were
lost when they were sent</i>

29:46.752 --> 29:50.170
<i>to the new doctors taking over
all of Dr. Foley's patients?</i>

29:50.205 --> 29:53.173
And I know you want everything
to be in order when it goes.

29:53.208 --> 29:56.593
Sergeant, I don't think this
is a good time to do this ...

29:56.628 --> 29:59.212
We think Daniel o'Neill
murdered this girl.

29:59.214 --> 30:01.631
She was 16 years old.

30:02.718 --> 30:05.719
Poor child.

30:08.640 --> 30:11.858
She looks familiar.

30:17.399 --> 30:19.449
I certainly wouldn't
want any of these files

30:19.484 --> 30:21.568
to leave here incomplete.

30:21.570 --> 30:25.818
Take a seat.
This may take a while.

30:35.217 --> 30:37.217
[keyboard keys clacking]

30:44.142 --> 30:45.592
You needed to see me?

30:45.644 --> 30:47.761
- Holy shit!
- What?

30:47.763 --> 30:50.263
- Why would you do that?
- Do what?

30:50.265 --> 30:53.400
- Sneak in here like some kind of ninja.
- Oh, that wasn't sneaking.

30:53.435 --> 30:56.319
Watch this. Ninja.

30:56.355 --> 31:00.299
- [singsong voice] I am a ninja!
- Okay, okay, now I'm afraid

31:00.300 --> 31:01.775
- you're gonna fall.
- No. I'm okay.

31:01.777 --> 31:03.410
Nice "wounded goose," though.

31:03.445 --> 31:04.527
- It was pretty good.
- Mm-hmm.

31:04.579 --> 31:05.745
[keyboard keys clacking]

31:05.781 --> 31:07.414
[chuckles]
So, did you need to see me?

31:07.449 --> 31:08.698
- Yes.
- Okay.

31:08.750 --> 31:11.584
- Uh, wait a sec.
- What do you got there?

31:13.622 --> 31:16.589
For me?
What's the occasion?

31:16.625 --> 31:19.626
No occasion. I saw it,
and I thought of you.

31:20.679 --> 31:22.462
All right.

31:23.598 --> 31:24.631
[gasps]

31:26.601 --> 31:28.435
This is beautiful.

31:32.140 --> 31:34.273
Wait. Am I being punked?

31:36.478 --> 31:41.531
- What is ... the keys to my spaceship?
- Nope. Just for the roof.

31:41.566 --> 31:44.784
You can put the telescope up there ...
you know, keep an eye out.

31:44.820 --> 31:48.488
Worst case, you get to see a
beautiful moon every now and then.

31:54.713 --> 31:56.329
Do you believe there's life up there?

31:57.416 --> 32:01.167
I believe that anything is possible.

32:01.219 --> 32:03.169
[chuckles]

32:12.347 --> 32:15.732
[keys jingle]

32:16.768 --> 32:19.769
[bicycle bell ringing]

32:24.776 --> 32:27.744
- What are you doing here, Daniel?
- I'm out for a ride.

32:27.779 --> 32:30.330
<i>I'm not doing anything.</i>

32:30.365 --> 32:32.248
I-I know where you've been today.

32:32.284 --> 32:34.334
My friends at the shelter told me

32:34.369 --> 32:36.419
some bitch cop was
around asking about me.

32:36.455 --> 32:41.624
Yeah, they miss you there.
Nobody could figure out why you quit.

32:41.676 --> 32:43.510
<i>They said you were so
good with the animals...</i>

32:44.546 --> 32:47.881
...so ready to be there with
them at their final moment.

32:47.883 --> 32:50.283
But we know why you quit, don't we?

32:51.720 --> 32:55.388
They don't kill dogs there anymore.
There's no thrills for you.

32:55.390 --> 32:58.975
Why are you picking on me, Jane?
I'm just a kid.

32:59.027 --> 33:02.529
I'm gonna make sure you
never hurt anybody ever again.

33:02.564 --> 33:03.688
Oh.

33:04.837 --> 33:07.060
Good luck with that.

33:08.286 --> 33:10.620
[bicycle bell ringing]

33:23.881 --> 33:26.148
[footsteps approach]

33:26.150 --> 33:27.717
There were 15 Daniel o'Neill narratives

33:27.752 --> 33:30.253
<i>all stuck in with other patients' files.</i>

33:31.322 --> 33:34.190
So...
we're looking for

33:34.225 --> 33:35.825
the serial killer/psychopath
checklist, huh?

33:35.860 --> 33:39.662
- Fire, torture.
- Voyeurism, antisocial behavior.

33:39.714 --> 33:42.298
I wonder how long it
took his mother to realize

33:42.333 --> 33:44.500
there was something
really wrong with him.

33:44.552 --> 33:47.720
Well, for most parents, I think there's

33:47.755 --> 33:49.672
<i>a significant degree of
denial that has to be overcome,</i>

33:49.674 --> 33:53.843
as well as the guilt about having
your child be such a person.

33:53.895 --> 33:55.177
I can't imagine.

33:56.230 --> 33:57.346
Oh.

33:59.233 --> 34:00.733
"Fire is alive.

34:00.768 --> 34:04.353
I love to watch it
breathe, jump around, dance.

34:04.389 --> 34:08.440
It consumes everything that
falls into it, that I put into it.

34:08.493 --> 34:11.243
It ripples and twists like
it's trying to escape."

34:17.668 --> 34:20.109
He did it.

34:21.873 --> 34:25.373
"I'll take her to the woods.
There's a quiet place I know.

34:25.426 --> 34:29.512
She can rest there safe
and secure, untouched.

34:29.547 --> 34:32.465
I want to help her sleep.
I know how to do that.

34:32.516 --> 34:34.766
I'll watch over her until
I'm sure she's gone."

34:34.802 --> 34:36.768
All the elements of Sheila's murder ...

34:36.804 --> 34:41.223
cage in the woods,
lack of sexual assault, drugs.

34:41.225 --> 34:44.025
This must be the narrative
that made Foley come to see me.

34:46.531 --> 34:49.532
The narratives aren't enough
to charge o'Neill with Sheila's murder.

34:49.567 --> 34:52.568
A lawyer will just claim
he was coerced to write these stories.

34:52.570 --> 34:54.904
Yeah. Without Dr. Foley to
give us therapeutic context,

34:54.906 --> 34:56.539
they're useless in court.

34:56.574 --> 34:58.658
We might be able to use them
for a competence hearing.

34:58.710 --> 35:01.253
Well, between the narratives
and the session notes and what I

35:01.254 --> 35:03.796
learned at the animal clinic, it
might be enough to get him committed.

35:03.831 --> 35:05.798
He's a minor ... and smart.

35:05.833 --> 35:07.967
When he turns 18, how
much do you want to bet

35:08.002 --> 35:09.919
he convinces everyone that he's cured?

35:09.971 --> 35:11.420
God, I wish you could have seen

35:11.472 --> 35:13.255
his smug little face
in the parking garage.

35:13.307 --> 35:15.007
Foley diagnosed him as a
high-functioning narcissist.

35:15.059 --> 35:17.676
He thinks he's smarter than we are.

35:20.398 --> 35:23.003
Well, he's not.

35:23.985 --> 35:25.267
- Hey, detective.
- Woman: Hmm?

35:25.319 --> 35:27.693
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- [elevator bell dings] Sure.

35:29.657 --> 35:33.442
[dog barking]

35:33.444 --> 35:35.611
<i>Jane: You knew that there
was a problem with Daniel</i>

35:35.663 --> 35:37.029
<i>for quite some time.</i>

35:37.081 --> 35:39.365
Was that why you sent
him to see Dr. Foley?

35:48.960 --> 35:52.628
[clears throat]
Um...

35:52.630 --> 35:56.932
You know, sending him to see
Dr. Foley is the best thing

35:56.968 --> 35:59.552
that you could have done for him.

35:59.604 --> 36:01.303
You knew that he had hurt someone,

36:01.355 --> 36:03.689
and I can imagine that
was very difficult for you.

36:14.452 --> 36:16.402
Please help us.

36:16.454 --> 36:19.030
Mrs. o'Neill, you can have Daniel
committed to a psychiatric hospital,

36:19.031 --> 36:23.075
where he will never, ever be
able to hurt anyone else again.

36:25.580 --> 36:30.332
Please.
I know this is difficult.

36:32.503 --> 36:33.803
Please help us.

36:47.935 --> 36:50.903
Okay.
I'll help you.

36:50.938 --> 36:52.438
Okay.

36:54.942 --> 36:58.861
Let's go.
Um...

36:58.863 --> 37:00.446
we need to go to my office.

37:00.498 --> 37:02.364
I have some paperwork to do,

37:02.416 --> 37:04.533
and then we'll go straight
to the D.A.'s office, okay?

37:04.535 --> 37:06.001
Here you go.

37:07.955 --> 37:09.705
Thank you.

37:19.433 --> 37:22.549
[crying]

37:23.938 --> 37:25.387
Okay.

37:28.559 --> 37:30.059
Mrs. o'Neill, I-I'm so sorry.

37:30.061 --> 37:31.944
I left the paperwork upstairs, okay?

37:31.979 --> 37:34.697
Just ... Just lock the door,
and I'll be right back, okay?

37:34.732 --> 37:35.815
Damn it.

37:36.868 --> 37:38.200
[sobbing quietly]

37:43.074 --> 37:45.074
<i>Daniel: Hi, Mom!</i>

37:45.076 --> 37:48.077
Open the door, Mom, please.
[door handle rattling]

37:48.079 --> 37:50.963
I just want to talk to you for a minute.

37:50.998 --> 37:52.915
[sobbing continues]

37:57.138 --> 37:58.721
[lock clicks]

37:59.757 --> 38:00.723
Hey!

38:02.894 --> 38:04.623
You move, you die.

38:04.846 --> 38:07.096
Please. I'm ... I'm just a kid.

38:07.098 --> 38:10.299
So was Sheila MacIntyre.

38:11.769 --> 38:13.435
[syringe clatters]

38:14.822 --> 38:16.906
[handcuffs clicking]

38:18.776 --> 38:21.610
[telephone rings]

38:21.612 --> 38:24.830
Korsak: Yes. Thank you.

38:24.866 --> 38:26.198
[receiver clicks]
Mrs. Lewis was right.

38:26.250 --> 38:28.000
Sheila MacIntyre was familiar.

38:28.035 --> 38:29.618
She was a patient of another doctor

38:29.670 --> 38:31.837
in Foley's medical suite
with a Thursday appointment.

38:31.873 --> 38:35.090
- How did we miss that?
- We didn't.

38:35.126 --> 38:36.625
That doctor moved his
practice four months ago.

38:36.677 --> 38:38.127
That's why Mrs. Lewis
recognized the photograph

38:38.129 --> 38:39.962
but didn't remember her name.

38:39.964 --> 38:42.097
So, Sheila spent two months
in a waiting room with Daniel.

38:42.133 --> 38:44.600
She probably told him
everything about herself.

38:46.938 --> 38:48.470
Why did he pick her?

38:49.523 --> 38:52.141
Because she fit in the cage.
[sighs]

38:52.193 --> 38:53.142
[elevator bell dings]

38:53.194 --> 38:54.894
Well, the lab confirmed ...

38:54.946 --> 38:57.646
it was tiletamine and
zolazepam in Daniel's syringe.

38:57.648 --> 38:59.481
We also found traces
of blood on the needle.

38:59.483 --> 39:02.568
It's being processed for
a DNA match to Sheila MacIntyre.

39:02.620 --> 39:04.486
Oh, Ernie in the D.A.'s
office is gonna love this case.

39:04.538 --> 39:05.788
It's all wrapped up with a bow on top.

39:05.823 --> 39:07.990
Speaking of gift-wrapped ...

39:08.042 --> 39:09.575
Jane, I have a little surprise for you.

39:10.795 --> 39:13.662
- You didn't.
- I did.

39:13.664 --> 39:16.582
Granted, I had to oil a few
hands and tug a few lines...

39:16.634 --> 39:19.322
No.
She means she grease

39:19.323 --> 39:21.053
a few palms and pull a few strings.

39:21.088 --> 39:22.838
...but your new,
plain-old-brown,

39:22.890 --> 39:25.758
no-holes, scotchgarded couch
is being delivered tonight.

39:26.844 --> 39:28.928
But I don't want a new couch.

39:28.980 --> 39:30.562
Well, it's too late.
It's already on its way.

39:30.598 --> 39:31.931
[cellphone vibrating]
So, happy early birthday.

39:31.983 --> 39:35.985
Thank you. [cellphone beeps]
Rizzoli.

39:38.572 --> 39:42.191
What?
Okay, uh...

39:42.243 --> 39:45.077
Yeah, I'm ... I'm on my way.

39:45.112 --> 39:50.249
Uh, I got to go.
Um, my apartment building is on fire.

40:00.177 --> 40:02.211
<i>- Maura: Angela.
- Angela: Where's Jane?</i>

40:02.263 --> 40:04.680
She ran out before we did.
She's got to be here by now.

40:04.715 --> 40:07.850
<i>- Jane?! Oh. Jane!
- Frankie: Ma, be careful.</i>

40:07.885 --> 40:08.851
[siren wailing]

40:08.886 --> 40:13.222
<i>What? Oh, Jane.</i>

40:13.274 --> 40:14.690
Angela: Ohh, honey. I'm so sorry.

40:14.725 --> 40:16.058
[police radio chatter]

40:21.816 --> 40:23.465
I'm really sorry, detective.

40:24.151 --> 40:27.780
- How bad?
- It's a total loss.

40:30.157 --> 40:33.709
<i>Man: Coming through.
Any of you guys know a Rizzoli?</i>

40:33.744 --> 40:35.744
<i>- All: Yep.
- Yeah.</i>

40:35.746 --> 40:38.080
We couldn't get the truck
down the street. [sighs]

40:41.585 --> 40:42.751
[sighs]

40:50.261 --> 40:54.813
- Really?
- You're welcome?

40:54.849 --> 40:57.182
[laughter]

40:57.234 --> 40:58.767
Whew!

40:58.769 --> 41:00.152
<i>- Sorry.
- All right.</i>

41:00.187 --> 41:03.188
<i>- Korsak: [laughing] I'm sorry.
- Frankie: It's a nice couch.</i>

41:03.240 --> 41:05.274
<i>- I'm sorry.
- That's a fine-looking couch.</i>

41:05.326 --> 41:08.027
<i>- Yeah, look at this. It's beautiful.
- The fabric is amazing.</i>

41:08.079 --> 41:09.912
All righty.

41:09.947 --> 41:12.455
[laughter]

41:13.084 --> 41:16.785
<i>Whoo-hoo!
[laughter]</i>

41:16.821 --> 41:19.545
<i>Jane: Yeah, I can sleep on it
right here.</i>
