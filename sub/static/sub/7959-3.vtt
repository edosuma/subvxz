00:12.775 --> 00:15.580
And winds...

00:15.628 --> 00:17.120
Let's not forget about those grace notes

00:17.121 --> 00:19.152
in the second bar of the diminuendo, okay?

00:19.200 --> 00:20.710
Let's keep them.

00:20.758 --> 00:24.282
We need them for that sense
of yearning, of sadness, okay?

00:24.330 --> 00:25.649
So it's not like...

00:25.697 --> 00:28.142
No, no, it's more like...

00:28.190 --> 00:29.221
You know? We... we... we...

00:29.269 --> 00:30.635
Just keep them there, okay?

00:30.683 --> 00:33.728
Ready, and...

00:35.741 --> 00:37.539
Okay.

00:37.587 --> 00:38.882
That's very funny. Okay.

00:38.930 --> 00:41.111
I'm laughing with you on this one, okay.

00:41.159 --> 00:43.029
Let's... let's... let's
get back to work, okay?

00:43.077 --> 00:45.570
Ready, and...

00:49.142 --> 00:51.444
Okay. Okay, that was the second time,

00:51.492 --> 00:53.266
and it is not funny, the joke,

00:53.314 --> 00:55.314
the second time because
it's, like, over explained.

00:58.660 --> 01:00.961
Guys, what's happening?

01:01.009 --> 01:02.735
No, I'm not laughing anymore. Look.

01:02.783 --> 01:04.461
Look. I'm not laughing, okay?

01:04.509 --> 01:05.612
Let's get back to work, okay?

01:05.660 --> 01:06.930
Come on.

01:06.978 --> 01:08.656
Guys, this is in really bad taste.

01:08.704 --> 01:11.701
I mean I'm... Wha...

01:11.749 --> 01:15.057
Warren Boyd, what are you doing?

01:15.105 --> 01:16.505
Get back to your seat, Warren Boyd.

01:21.338 --> 01:22.561
Warren Boyd.

01:27.955 --> 01:29.321
Good morning...

01:29.369 --> 01:30.448
Good morning.

01:30.496 --> 01:32.462
...my new friend.

01:34.547 --> 01:37.448
I love the gray in your beard.

01:37.496 --> 01:41.596
Mm. It's the march of the time, you know?

01:41.643 --> 01:44.544
It's sexy.

01:44.592 --> 01:46.750
And your skin.

01:46.798 --> 01:48.380
What about my skin?

01:48.428 --> 01:51.065
It's like a goat skin pouch

01:51.113 --> 01:53.151
where I can keep all my little jewels.

01:53.199 --> 01:55.500
Okay...

01:55.548 --> 01:57.945
Hold it. Hold that thought.

02:01.901 --> 02:03.171
Gloria?

02:03.219 --> 02:04.490
Rodrigo, what's going on there?

02:04.538 --> 02:05.880
Hey. It's early even for your standards.

02:05.928 --> 02:06.959
I got a call this morning from

02:07.007 --> 02:08.205
the manager of your building.

02:08.253 --> 02:10.363
Are you throwing some kind of an orgy?

02:10.411 --> 02:11.658
Orgy? No.

02:11.706 --> 02:12.833
She's really very upset.

02:12.881 --> 02:15.134
No. No. No, it's not an orgy.

02:15.182 --> 02:18.754
It's not a... it's like
a... no, it's like a...

02:18.802 --> 02:20.576
Like a bacchanal, you
know? Like in a plaza, yeah.

02:20.624 --> 02:22.014
- You're throwing a bacchanal?
- Yeah.

02:22.062 --> 02:23.405
They're very loud.

02:23.453 --> 02:25.730
- I... hold on one second.
- Hold one second.

02:25.778 --> 02:27.768
One second, Gloria. Hey, Mr. Hamburg.

02:27.816 --> 02:29.014
Hey, how are you? You okay?

02:29.062 --> 02:30.429
Not so great, Mr. DeSouza.

02:30.477 --> 02:31.460
It's a little loud.

02:31.508 --> 02:33.449
Loud? I will tell them to quiet down, yes?

02:33.497 --> 02:35.295
Changes will be made. Changes will be made.

02:35.343 --> 02:37.117
I'm afraid changes have already been made.

02:37.165 --> 02:39.131
- Rodrigo...
- Gloria?

02:39.179 --> 02:41.097
Hey, do you want to join our drum circle?

02:41.145 --> 02:43.326
I don't really have time for circles.

02:43.374 --> 02:44.765
Who doesn't have time for circles?

02:44.813 --> 02:46.874
You're gonna have to find
another place to live.

02:46.922 --> 02:48.577
Oh, wait.

02:48.624 --> 02:50.285
Mr. Hamburg is telling
me that I have to go.

02:50.286 --> 02:52.196
- I have to go. Okay. Okay.
- Go... where are you going?

02:52.244 --> 02:54.138
- We all have to go!
- Everybody, we have to go!

02:54.186 --> 02:55.265
It doesn't have to be this minute.

02:55.313 --> 02:57.734
- Nobody is listening to me.
- Gloria...

02:57.782 --> 03:00.057
- I mean this is a sign, right?
- What do you mean it's a sign?

03:00.058 --> 03:02.289
- I have to go.
- Where are you gonna go?

03:02.337 --> 03:04.447
I don't know. I don't know.

03:06.293 --> 03:07.371
I don't know.

03:09.457 --> 03:10.608
Whoa.

03:10.656 --> 03:12.216
11:00 a.m. and you're drinking already?

03:12.262 --> 03:13.796
It's not hooch. It's distilled water.

03:13.844 --> 03:14.995
You should have some.

03:15.043 --> 03:17.153
Hydration is the best thing for jet lag.

03:17.200 --> 03:18.615
You've been home for a week.

03:18.663 --> 03:20.389
Do not shame him.

03:20.437 --> 03:22.077
I think I'm gonna fall asleep right here.

03:22.091 --> 03:24.464
Oh, no. That's not happening.
Get up. Come on. Get up!

03:24.512 --> 03:26.526
It's so comfortable on the
table. Pillow was so nice...

03:26.574 --> 03:28.708
Just walk it off.

03:28.756 --> 03:30.050
- I'm so tired.
- On your feet.

03:30.098 --> 03:31.704
Please, let me just sleep.

03:31.752 --> 03:34.030
Elizabeth, there's a couch
right here; it's not nice.

03:34.078 --> 03:35.228
I'll be up in a little bit.

03:35.276 --> 03:37.170
Come on. No, no.

03:37.218 --> 03:39.232
Remember when we went scuba diving?

03:39.280 --> 03:40.910
Remember when you ran out of air?

03:40.958 --> 03:42.876
- Yes.
- Do you remember what we did?

03:42.924 --> 03:44.386
We buddy breathed.

03:44.434 --> 03:45.561
That's right.

03:45.609 --> 03:47.023
All the way to the surface.

03:50.691 --> 03:53.040
Okay. You're right. I can do this.

03:53.088 --> 03:55.438
- I can stay up today...
- Mm-hmm.

03:55.486 --> 03:57.403
Go to bed early, get
a great night's sleep...

03:57.451 --> 03:59.154
- Perfect.
- Wake up refreshed tomorrow.

03:59.201 --> 04:00.304
Shoot the Ferndale.

04:00.352 --> 04:01.815
What are you doing at the Ferndale?

04:01.862 --> 04:03.157
Shooting it for my podcast.

04:03.205 --> 04:04.619
Oh, cool. Can I come?

04:04.667 --> 04:06.513
The place is like a
famous musician's building.

04:06.561 --> 04:09.462
That's a great idea. Can Hailey and I come?

04:09.510 --> 04:11.979
Typically, I'm kind of a
one-man band, but I mean yeah.

04:12.027 --> 04:13.777
Maybe it'd be nice to have you guys there.

04:13.825 --> 04:16.149
Thank you. Oh, my God.
This is amazing news.

04:16.197 --> 04:17.517
Thank you so much! Wow.

04:17.565 --> 04:19.245
What? Your test results come back negative?

04:19.267 --> 04:20.442
No. That was yesterday.

04:20.490 --> 04:22.072
That was my agent. I got it.

04:22.120 --> 04:23.247
I booked Danse Haus.

04:23.294 --> 04:24.469
- What?
- It's mine, yeah.

04:24.517 --> 04:26.315
Wait, what? You're gonna be on Danse Haus?

04:26.363 --> 04:28.425
- Yeah, dude. Yes.
- No way.

04:28.473 --> 04:29.863
That's awesome.

04:29.911 --> 04:31.086
Wait, why is there high-fiving?

04:31.134 --> 04:32.764
What is Danse... what is Danse Haus?

04:32.812 --> 04:34.730
- It's a dance reality show.
- It's the best.

04:34.778 --> 04:36.216
I love Danse Haus.

04:36.264 --> 04:37.582
You like reality TV?

04:37.630 --> 04:38.661
I like Danse Haus.

04:38.709 --> 04:40.267
Alex, when do you leave?

04:40.315 --> 04:42.857
Uh, I don't know.

04:42.905 --> 04:44.726
Soon. Very soon.

04:44.774 --> 04:46.932
Have you seen my white tights?

04:46.980 --> 04:50.504
I feel like last time I saw
them, they were in your room.

04:50.552 --> 04:52.374
I wore them, and I stretched them out.

04:52.422 --> 04:53.764
- I'm really sorry.
- Not again.

04:53.812 --> 04:55.802
Oh, God.

04:55.850 --> 04:58.535
I want to throw you a going away party.

04:58.583 --> 04:59.949
Yeah. I don't know.

04:59.997 --> 05:01.771
The thing is, like, if
I say yes to this gig,

05:01.819 --> 05:03.499
I have to leave for L.A., like, right now.

05:03.521 --> 05:04.840
What do you mean "if"?

05:04.888 --> 05:07.141
Well, I mean there's some factors involved.

05:07.189 --> 05:08.628
Like, what kind of factors?

05:08.676 --> 05:10.474
Like, it's a three-month
commitment, Hailey.

05:10.522 --> 05:12.751
I know. You told me.

05:12.799 --> 05:14.981
Yeah. I just talked to the producers,

05:15.029 --> 05:16.389
and they said that if I take this,

05:16.419 --> 05:18.121
I can't have any contact
with the outside world,

05:18.169 --> 05:21.333
so... I can't...

05:21.381 --> 05:25.936
talk to my parents or friends or see you.

05:25.984 --> 05:29.508
Well, that's really lame, but
I think that you should do it.

05:29.556 --> 05:31.858
This is a really good opportunity for you.

05:34.687 --> 05:35.693
You do?

05:35.741 --> 05:39.937
I do.

05:39.985 --> 05:43.197
Cool. Well, then pack my bags.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.872
Okay. So on the pension vesting,

05:47.920 --> 05:49.310
they came back at seven years.

05:49.358 --> 05:50.509
It's always been five years.

05:50.557 --> 05:51.779
Well, there could be some wiggle room.

05:51.827 --> 05:53.074
No, no. We're not wiggling.

05:53.122 --> 05:54.345
We'll go back hard with five.

05:54.392 --> 05:55.807
I don't think we should come on too strong.

05:55.855 --> 05:57.988
The game is chess, not checkers.

05:58.036 --> 05:59.043
You gotta be aggressive.

05:59.091 --> 06:00.458
Oh, I can be aggressive.

06:00.506 --> 06:01.824
Can you?

06:01.872 --> 06:03.814
Cat fight in E minor.

06:03.862 --> 06:05.612
Seriously, Warren?

06:05.660 --> 06:07.218
Oh, shit.

06:07.266 --> 06:09.233
You know, I think I forgot one
of my folders up in the room.

06:09.234 --> 06:10.766
- Take five.
- Hey, don't worry.

06:10.814 --> 06:13.163
We're good at taking five.

06:13.211 --> 06:14.913
Waiter.

06:14.961 --> 06:16.640
- Hey, where are you going?
- To the bathroom.

06:16.687 --> 06:18.342
That okay with you?

06:18.390 --> 06:19.612
I'll take another Old-Fashioned.

06:19.660 --> 06:21.410
- Bob?
- What's in that again?

06:21.458 --> 06:23.784
Whiskey, crushed sugar, dash of bitters.

06:23.831 --> 06:24.838
Do you want one?

06:24.886 --> 06:27.619
Nah. I'm bitter enough.

06:30.160 --> 06:32.294
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:32.342 --> 06:34.332
So we haven't talked about
what happened the other day.

06:34.380 --> 06:36.106
- I mean, what you said to me.
- Right, right.

06:36.154 --> 06:37.634
- I apologize. That was...
- Thank you.

06:37.640 --> 06:38.743
'Cause I think this negotiation's

06:38.791 --> 06:40.517
too important to mess up.

06:40.565 --> 06:41.946
No, you're right, and it's
not gonna happen again,

06:41.947 --> 06:43.034
- I promise.
- Good.

06:43.082 --> 06:45.455
Even if I do think you're
fucking hot as hell.

06:47.000 --> 06:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:57.226 --> 06:59.623
Oh, you should go first. I'll follow.

06:59.671 --> 07:01.254
Okay.

07:06.672 --> 07:10.004
Hey. Tinkle, tinkle, little star.

07:10.052 --> 07:11.586
Jesus, Bob. What are you, five?

07:11.634 --> 07:14.343
Okay, so... where were we?

07:14.391 --> 07:16.740
Where's your folder?

07:16.788 --> 07:18.107
Uh, you know,

07:18.155 --> 07:21.847
I must have left my brain
up in the room as well.

07:21.894 --> 07:25.251
- Be right back.
- Take two on taking five.

07:25.299 --> 07:26.929
It is beautiful, Gloria.

07:26.977 --> 07:28.775
Thank you so much for
letting me stay at your place.

07:28.823 --> 07:30.645
Oh, please, do you know
how many women would kill

07:30.693 --> 07:32.802
to have you as their roommate?

07:32.850 --> 07:34.265
And your assistant

07:34.313 --> 07:35.991
can pick up the rest
of your things tomorrow.

07:36.039 --> 07:38.748
Oh, no. But this is it.

07:38.796 --> 07:40.450
That's it? That's all you have?

07:40.498 --> 07:41.744
That's all I need.

07:41.792 --> 07:43.422
Well, for today, yes.

07:43.470 --> 07:46.179
But tomorrow, you may want
more than a roller bag.

07:46.227 --> 07:48.097
But what could I possibly want?

07:48.145 --> 07:51.573
I don't know. A home of your own?

07:53.227 --> 07:55.169
So I'm gonna hop in the shower,

07:55.217 --> 07:57.207
but maybe we can order some takeout.

07:57.255 --> 07:58.286
Yes. Hop, hop.

07:58.334 --> 08:00.515
Hop the takeout, yes.

08:00.563 --> 08:04.567
Just make yourself at home!
Mi townhouse es su townhouse.

08:04.615 --> 08:05.837
Gracias.

08:05.885 --> 08:08.115
Minus the drum circles, of course.

Gloria, what have you been hiding?

09:37.175 --> 09:39.093
What do you mean? Nothing.

09:39.141 --> 09:40.675
Your voice, so beautiful.

09:40.723 --> 09:42.281
Oh, you're too kind.

09:42.329 --> 09:43.384
No. No "kind," no.

09:43.432 --> 09:45.446
You should be performing
in front of an audience.

09:45.494 --> 09:46.692
Oh, well. I used to.

09:46.740 --> 09:49.138
- Gloria Antoinette.
- Gloria Antoinette?

09:49.186 --> 09:52.302
My late husband thought it unbecoming.

09:52.350 --> 09:53.836
Oh, who cares?

09:53.884 --> 09:55.970
He's late.

09:56.018 --> 09:58.847
I have always dreamed of
singing in public again.

09:58.895 --> 10:00.045
Well, you should.

10:00.093 --> 10:01.508
Why don't you?

10:01.556 --> 10:03.282
- I couldn't.
- Why not?

10:03.330 --> 10:07.573
Because I'm surrounded by
the most brilliant musicians

10:07.621 --> 10:09.227
in the world.

10:09.275 --> 10:12.104
I'm not an artist like you people are.

10:12.152 --> 10:14.621
I'm just an amateur.

10:14.669 --> 10:15.988
"Amateur."

10:16.035 --> 10:19.464
You say that as if it was
a dirty word or something,

10:19.512 --> 10:24.162
but "amateur" comes from
the Latin word "amare,"

10:24.210 --> 10:26.943
which means love, love.

10:26.991 --> 10:28.382
To do things for the love of it.

10:29.868 --> 10:31.594
I see you found my lotions.

10:31.642 --> 10:32.865
Soothing, right?

10:32.913 --> 10:34.974
Beyond. Yeah.

10:35.022 --> 10:38.211
Do you think that my skin
is like a goat skin's pouch?

10:38.259 --> 10:41.471
No. Who said that?

10:41.519 --> 10:45.882
Yeah. Mm. Mm.

10:45.930 --> 10:51.899
Gloria, we are notes in this
beautiful concert of existence.

10:51.947 --> 10:57.006
If we don't play ourselves, nobody will.

10:57.054 --> 11:02.951
I want to hear Gloria
Antoinette sing again in public.

11:02.999 --> 11:04.437
A big audience, eh?

11:07.482 --> 11:09.424
À demain.

11:18.869 --> 11:21.530
Hi. This is B Sharp,

11:21.578 --> 11:24.191
a musical podcast where
classical music is our forte.

11:24.239 --> 11:27.523
I am Bradford Sharp. I stand
now at the Ferndale home

11:27.571 --> 11:30.041
for artists, erect... line?

11:30.089 --> 11:33.277
Erected in 1932 as part of FDR's New Deal.

11:33.325 --> 11:37.736
Erected in 1932 as part of FDR's New Deal,

11:37.784 --> 11:39.102
this building was a home

11:39.150 --> 11:41.955
for musicians, thespians,
and artists of all...

11:42.003 --> 11:44.952
1934. Actually, 1932,

11:45.000 --> 11:48.955
and the reason I remember
that is because it was in 1932

11:49.003 --> 11:51.640
that FDR repealed the Provision Act.

11:51.688 --> 11:53.510
We didn't have to go
to speakeasies anymore,

11:53.558 --> 11:55.260
and knock on the door
and say, "Joe sent me."

11:55.308 --> 11:58.161
Wow. Thank you.

11:58.209 --> 12:00.415
Sir, if you're who I think you are,

12:00.463 --> 12:01.973
and I'm pretty sure you are,

12:02.021 --> 12:03.651
it's an honor. You are...

12:03.699 --> 12:05.952
Marcello Gallitelli, the famous oboist.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.966
Well, Toscanini liked me.

12:08.014 --> 12:09.237
Klemperer liked me.

12:09.285 --> 12:10.771
Furtwängler liked me.

12:10.819 --> 12:12.545
I'm Bradford Sharp.

12:12.593 --> 12:14.463
- This is Ms. Elizabeth Campbell.
- Hi.

12:14.511 --> 12:16.031
How do you do? My pleasure to meet you.

12:16.045 --> 12:17.939
I'm Hailey. It's wonderful to meet you.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.761
Hailey plays oboe for
the New York Symphony.

12:19.809 --> 12:21.295
Well, I'm just a sub for now, but...

12:21.343 --> 12:22.503
Substitute? But not for long.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.532
You look like a first oboist to me.

12:24.580 --> 12:26.521
- Wow.
- Why don't we go up to my place

12:26.569 --> 12:29.206
because I think it's time
to mix a few cocktails,

12:29.254 --> 12:32.179
- don't you think so?
- Yes, yes.

12:32.227 --> 12:33.306
Yes, yes.

12:33.354 --> 12:35.487
Hailey, tell me. Do you know that joke,

12:35.535 --> 12:38.196
"How does an oboist make $1 million?"

12:38.244 --> 12:40.378
Start with $2 million?

12:40.426 --> 12:41.792
Oh!

12:41.840 --> 12:45.556
If you could have lunch with any musician

12:45.604 --> 12:48.912
or composer of classical
music in all of history,

12:48.960 --> 12:51.022
who would it be?

12:51.070 --> 12:54.570
I suppose it would be with Puccini.

12:54.618 --> 12:59.293
"Un bel di" from "Madame
Butterfly" by Puccini. Yeah.

12:59.341 --> 13:02.793
That has a very, very difficult
oboe solo in the very beginning.

13:02.841 --> 13:04.471
Hailey, do you ever play that opera?

13:04.519 --> 13:05.837
No, but I would love to.

13:05.885 --> 13:08.786
It reminds me of Marcel Tabuteau.

13:08.834 --> 13:11.231
Hot shot first prize conservatory winner.

13:11.279 --> 13:13.653
He joined the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra.

13:13.701 --> 13:15.546
And Toscanini was the conductor.

13:15.594 --> 13:21.036
Toscanini was, in my opinion,
the essence of a conductor.

13:21.084 --> 13:22.714
Many players, brass players,

13:22.762 --> 13:24.105
and woodwind players, like oboes,

13:24.153 --> 13:25.927
and they had to modify
their way of playing,

13:25.975 --> 13:28.276
way of thinking, in order
to satisfy his demands.

13:28.324 --> 13:29.810
What do you think of Mozart?

13:29.858 --> 13:33.646
Ah, Mozart, for me, was a
supreme genius of all-time.

13:33.694 --> 13:37.338
He was a kind of composer who
could be playing pool with you,

13:37.386 --> 13:39.112
and between shots, he
would sit at the table

13:39.160 --> 13:42.277
and write some more of a
symphony or string quartet.

13:42.324 --> 13:44.938
He was once invited to a very swank party,

13:44.985 --> 13:46.184
and he came to the party.

13:46.232 --> 13:47.575
He hadn't shaved in three or four days,

13:47.623 --> 13:49.780
and his wig was askew,

13:49.828 --> 13:52.393
and he had been drinking.

13:52.441 --> 13:54.958
The nobility regarded him with horror.

13:55.006 --> 13:59.226
He turned around, and he said...

13:59.273 --> 14:00.664
Which means, "Anyone who doesn't like me

14:00.712 --> 14:02.198
can kiss my ass," and he walked out.

14:02.246 --> 14:04.739
This is... I'm in heaven.

14:04.787 --> 14:06.513
Thank you so much. Wow.

14:06.561 --> 14:09.318
Mr. Gallitelli, I've never
seen my boyfriend this happy.

14:09.366 --> 14:10.469
- I'm jealous.
- No.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.291
You have nothing to be jealous about.

14:12.339 --> 14:13.921
And you, what are you staring at?

14:13.969 --> 14:16.534
Why don't you pick one of those up?

14:16.582 --> 14:18.116
Yes, that's... you see,

14:18.164 --> 14:19.723
the one you have in your
hands right now, that's the one

14:19.771 --> 14:22.288
I use for all baroque
music like Bach and Handel

14:22.336 --> 14:23.606
and Mozart and Haydn.

14:23.654 --> 14:26.603
Now, the other one is for everything else.

14:26.651 --> 14:28.497
Hailey, why don't you
play something for me?

14:28.545 --> 14:30.894
Oh, no, Mr. Gallitelli, I can't do that.

14:30.942 --> 14:32.428
- Oh, yes, you can.
- Yes.

14:32.476 --> 14:33.651
You must play something.

14:33.699 --> 14:35.569
Don't be so timid because, my dear,

14:35.617 --> 14:37.103
you'll never be a first oboist.

14:37.151 --> 14:40.363
A first oboist has to be
an extrovert, a showoff.

14:40.411 --> 14:42.281
You've got to be a prima donna.

14:42.329 --> 14:44.199
I want to hear you sing. Sing!

14:44.247 --> 14:45.829
Okay.

14:45.877 --> 14:47.747
Something lyrical.

15:19.823 --> 15:22.077
Brava, brava. That was beautiful.

15:22.125 --> 15:24.714
My dear, I can assure you that you're going

15:24.762 --> 15:26.248
- to have a career.
- Thank you.

15:26.296 --> 15:28.496
And you played so well that
I think you deserve a drink.

15:28.502 --> 15:29.964
I think we all deserve a drink, don't you?

15:30.012 --> 15:32.313
My dearly beloved, we are gathered here

15:32.361 --> 15:34.663
to witness the bond of holy matrimony

15:34.711 --> 15:39.002
of Mr. Vodka...

15:40.872 --> 15:44.228
And Ms. Vermouth.

15:44.276 --> 15:47.824
But only... only a small
drop for Ms. Vermouth.

15:49.718 --> 15:51.780
I love it here.

15:51.827 --> 15:53.314
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

15:53.362 --> 15:55.543
I'm fine. Yeah.

15:55.591 --> 15:58.108
All right. Hit me.

15:58.156 --> 16:01.369
It's not just one thing.

16:01.417 --> 16:03.550
Alex is leaving.

16:03.598 --> 16:05.204
Things are crazy at work,

16:06.379 --> 16:08.513
and being here is...

16:12.229 --> 16:14.434
I think I'm gonna get a place of my own.

16:14.482 --> 16:17.023
- What?
- I don't know.

16:17.071 --> 16:20.092
You and Bradford are so happy.

16:20.140 --> 16:21.458
You should be able to be at home

16:21.506 --> 16:24.599
without the sound of oboe scales

16:24.647 --> 16:27.907
just constantly going on in the background.

16:29.130 --> 16:31.072
You almost fell into a volcano.

16:31.119 --> 16:32.870
Twice.

16:32.917 --> 16:34.644
Well, maybe I should too.

16:37.041 --> 16:38.168
Yeah.

16:38.216 --> 16:40.349
Ladies, where are our drinks?

16:40.397 --> 16:41.764
Coming!

16:41.811 --> 16:43.418
To be continued.

17:00.127 --> 17:03.747
Please accept our deepest condolences

17:03.795 --> 17:07.127
for this incredible loss
which is all the greater now

17:07.175 --> 17:08.374
because we will never hear

17:08.422 --> 17:09.740
the maestro's beautiful interpretation

17:09.788 --> 17:14.463
of Beethoven's Fifth
as our guest conductor.

17:14.511 --> 17:15.853
Include a lot of roses, Michelle,

17:15.901 --> 17:16.980
in the message, please.

17:17.028 --> 17:18.323
A lot of... Maestro! Yes?

17:18.371 --> 17:20.121
I think I've got some good news.

17:20.169 --> 17:21.295
Sikorsky is in?

17:21.343 --> 17:23.213
Oh, no, no. He's booked at La Scala.

17:23.261 --> 17:24.604
And Graham?

17:24.652 --> 17:27.001
- Yes, he's already committed.
- Graham?

17:27.049 --> 17:31.867
To a sanitarium near Geneva,
but don't fret... pun intended...

17:31.915 --> 17:33.306
I have found somebody.

17:33.354 --> 17:35.224
- Who?
- Lennox.

17:35.272 --> 17:36.878
Rehearsal in five. Rehearsal in five.

17:36.926 --> 17:40.426
Oh. That's an interesting idea.

17:40.474 --> 17:42.991
Yeah. People say that he's
got a little bit of talent.

17:43.039 --> 17:44.190
Oh, no. He's a prodigy.

17:44.238 --> 17:45.652
He'll definitely... I mean,

17:45.700 --> 17:48.505
they say that he can
conduct all night long.

17:48.553 --> 17:50.183
Maybe. Maybe,

17:50.231 --> 17:54.330
but does that make him ready to...

17:54.378 --> 17:57.519
Maestro, can he conduct
the New York Symphony?

17:57.567 --> 17:59.437
- Is he ready?
- Funny you should say that.

17:59.485 --> 18:03.920
That's exactly what the board
said before they hired you.

18:03.967 --> 18:05.166
Your decision, Maestro.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.173
Maestro!

18:13.221 --> 18:16.242
What the hell's going on?

18:16.290 --> 18:17.800
I couldn't help myself.

18:17.848 --> 18:19.766
I mean what do you do when
you see a Ferrari idling

18:19.814 --> 18:23.122
with the keys in it, hey?
I was gonna bring it back.

18:23.170 --> 18:24.968
Maestro, meet Lennox.

18:25.016 --> 18:27.150
The pleasure is all mine.

18:27.197 --> 18:28.660
I'm still pinching myself.

18:28.708 --> 18:31.129
Never in my wildest did I
think I'd be hanging with two

18:31.177 --> 18:32.999
of my idols from the older generation.

18:33.047 --> 18:35.252
We are delighted to have you with us.

18:35.300 --> 18:39.016
And you know, I had a few
goes at the fifth myself.

18:39.064 --> 18:40.239
Yes, of course.

18:40.287 --> 18:41.653
It's the definitive version.

18:41.701 --> 18:43.427
I did it as well to some acclaim.

18:43.475 --> 18:44.578
- Oh, you did it?
- A few years ago.

18:44.626 --> 18:46.352
Yeah. I know. I know. I saw it.

18:46.400 --> 18:49.061
The way you brought the piccolos
in in the fourth movement...

18:49.109 --> 18:51.434
so simple, in a good way.

18:51.482 --> 18:53.760
- You were there?
- Well, I was ten at the time,

18:53.808 --> 18:55.726
but I saw it online.

18:55.773 --> 18:57.188
Wicked respectful.

18:57.236 --> 18:58.435
Respectful?

18:58.482 --> 18:59.849
- Wicked respectful.
- Yes.

18:59.897 --> 19:01.407
Listen, why don't we get together later on?

19:01.455 --> 19:02.846
Maybe we could have a... the three of us,

19:02.894 --> 19:04.644
and have a boy's night out or something?

19:04.691 --> 19:07.760
I'd love to but I've got custody tonight.

19:07.808 --> 19:09.294
Yeah.

19:09.342 --> 19:11.092
Her name's Allegra Non Troppo.

19:11.140 --> 19:13.202
Allegra, hey.

19:14.688 --> 19:17.229
I love the acoustics in here!

19:17.277 --> 19:19.387
I don't think she likes you much, mate.

19:20.897 --> 19:23.534
Producers can't stop
us from texting, right?

19:23.582 --> 19:25.093
Yeah.

19:25.141 --> 19:27.394
I got you something.

19:29.983 --> 19:31.685
New white tights!

19:31.733 --> 19:33.675
- Cool, cool. Thanks.
- Sorry about that, yeah.

19:33.723 --> 19:35.089
Yeah. Look.

19:35.137 --> 19:36.816
It's three months. It's gonna be fine.

19:36.863 --> 19:40.220
- Just stop it!
- Stop what?

19:40.268 --> 19:41.850
Like, trying to manage my feelings.

19:41.898 --> 19:44.655
Just please stop the bullshit
and be honest for once.

19:44.703 --> 19:46.309
You're happy I'm going.

19:46.357 --> 19:48.011
What are you talking about?

19:48.059 --> 19:49.977
You didn't even try to seem sad.

19:50.025 --> 19:52.590
That's because I'm not
an actor playing a role.

19:52.638 --> 19:54.412
- I'm your girlfriend.
- Yeah, exactly.

19:54.460 --> 19:56.737
That's why you should be more ambivalent.

19:56.785 --> 19:58.391
Okay. That's just weird.

19:58.439 --> 20:01.316
What? No. Actually it's normal
to, like, want the person

20:01.364 --> 20:03.162
that you're supposedly
in a relationship with

20:03.210 --> 20:04.888
to be upset when you're
going away for months.

20:04.936 --> 20:07.237
Listen. Do you know what?
Please, can you try to care

20:07.285 --> 20:10.186
about something a little bit
more than your oboe, okay?

20:10.234 --> 20:11.936
Alex, hold on!

20:11.984 --> 20:14.142
Stop!

20:14.190 --> 20:15.556
What?

20:15.604 --> 20:18.553
So that's it? You're just gonna walk away?

20:18.601 --> 20:22.484
Well, what do you want me to do?

20:22.532 --> 20:23.995
See that?

20:24.043 --> 20:26.584
That's the problem right there.

20:31.642 --> 20:33.176
- Come on, Bobby!
- Let's go!

20:33.224 --> 20:34.783
Come on, Bob. Let's go, let's go!

20:34.831 --> 20:36.005
Boo!

20:36.053 --> 20:38.762
- Whoo!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

20:39.913 --> 20:41.279
Oh, boo!

20:41.327 --> 20:42.598
Whoo!

20:42.646 --> 20:44.755
Oh, don't jazz hands me, you motherfuckers.

20:44.803 --> 20:47.201
Drop your socks and grab your jocks.

20:47.249 --> 20:49.286
Babe Ruthless is up!

20:49.334 --> 20:51.396
- Wait for a good one!
- All right!

20:51.444 --> 20:52.834
Hey. Watch it, sister.

20:52.882 --> 20:54.369
Stop trying to give me the brushback.

20:54.417 --> 20:56.454
Well, tell your tits to stop
crowding the plate, then.

20:56.502 --> 20:57.629
Can't help it.

20:57.677 --> 20:59.091
Don't you talk about her tits.

20:59.139 --> 21:00.819
- Let's go, baby.
- Are you ready, pitcher?

21:02.280 --> 21:03.718
Wait for a good one!

21:03.766 --> 21:06.020
- Wait for a good one!
- What are you talking about?

21:06.068 --> 21:07.194
Oh, Jesus.

21:07.242 --> 21:09.783
Ball!

21:09.831 --> 21:10.766
Maestro?

21:12.205 --> 21:13.691
"Hai Lai," hey. What are you doing here?

21:13.739 --> 21:15.321
Are you spying on us?

21:15.369 --> 21:17.359
No. I told them not to do softball,

21:17.407 --> 21:18.927
and look at them. They're softballing.

21:18.965 --> 21:21.123
Well, why don't you just
go in there and stop us?

21:21.171 --> 21:22.561
I wanted to. That was why I came for,

21:22.609 --> 21:24.444
but then I saw the game, it got good,

21:24.445 --> 21:25.965
and I got conflicted.

21:26.013 --> 21:27.667
- Ball!
- I don't know why I'm worrying.

21:27.715 --> 21:29.441
You couldn't hit water
if it fell out of a boat.

21:29.489 --> 21:32.486
Well, you couldn't hit a
high C if it fell from D!

21:33.709 --> 21:35.027
- So how's the practicing?
- Practicing

21:35.075 --> 21:36.633
is going really well.

21:36.681 --> 21:37.952
Good.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.822
I'm glad you're not getting distracted

21:39.870 --> 21:43.394
by... social distractions.

21:43.442 --> 21:45.647
Like donor events?

21:45.695 --> 21:47.949
I thought you said that
the falcon must take wing.

21:47.997 --> 21:50.202
- "Falcon"?
- I'm the falcon.

21:50.250 --> 21:51.736
What are you talking about?

21:51.784 --> 21:54.254
I'm pretty sure that you
know what I'm talking about.

21:54.302 --> 21:55.860
What are you talking about?

21:55.908 --> 21:59.120
"Hai Lai," I'm talking
about what I'm talking about.

21:59.168 --> 22:00.654
I don't think you are

22:00.702 --> 22:04.826
because we never talk about
what we're talking about.

22:06.552 --> 22:08.733
- Sorry.
- Fucker!

22:08.781 --> 22:11.418
Oh, shit. Aah!

22:14.343 --> 22:15.470
No, Hai Lai, Hai Lai!

22:15.518 --> 22:17.771
One sec!

22:17.819 --> 22:20.816
- What did you hurt? What hurts?
- Oh, God! My finger!

22:20.864 --> 22:23.117
On a scale of one to ten,
how's it feel when I do this?

22:23.165 --> 22:24.604
- One.
- That's not so bad.

22:24.652 --> 22:26.857
Because it's the wrong finger, you idiot.

22:26.905 --> 22:28.463
- It's this one.
- Oh, my God.

22:28.511 --> 22:30.357
Oh, my fucking God, Betty.

22:30.405 --> 22:32.874
I hope you got your
passport in order, Rutledge,

22:32.922 --> 22:35.176
because it looks like you'll
be the one going to Mexico.

22:35.224 --> 22:37.453
Dee Dee. Get Dee Dee.
Give me something, Dee Dee.

22:37.501 --> 22:39.515
I got some oxy and some Vicodin.

22:39.563 --> 22:41.289
There you go.

22:41.337 --> 22:42.871
There you go. There you go.
