        Cheers <i>is filmed</i>

         (phone rings)          

00:09.342 --> 00:11.777
        Cheers.                 

00:11.811 --> 00:14.580
Uh, hang on a second,           
I'll check.                     

00:16.716 --> 00:18.884
    Yeah, the refrigerator's    
            running.            

00:18.918 --> 00:21.320
     Thank you for asking.      

00:23.590 --> 00:25.157
             What?              

00:25.191 --> 00:26.158
        (chuckles)              

00:26.192 --> 00:28.394
How could it possibly get away? 

00:30.096 --> 00:33.699
No, a refrigerator doesn't have 
     the power of movement.     

00:35.301 --> 00:38.070
  Well, yeah, sure, I get it,   
            but see,            

00:38.138 --> 00:42.041
running-- the way you're using  
it-- c-can only mean working.   

00:42.075 --> 00:44.076
         See, it's a--          
  it's what we call a homonym.  

00:46.079 --> 00:48.547
I'm sorry, too.

00:54.521 --> 00:56.889
              Well, you tried to
            explain the joke.   

00:56.923 --> 00:58.991
      That's the problem.

02:12.999 --> 02:14.299
      Hey, uh, Dr. Crane,       

02:14.334 --> 02:16.335
          after you're done with
      that paper, can I have it?

02:16.369 --> 02:18.070
Well, actually, I planned       
      on saving it, Woody.      

02:18.104 --> 02:19.138
  See, there's an article here  

02:19.172 --> 02:20.739
    on the ins and out          
    of buying diamonds          

02:20.774 --> 02:22.775
    and I was thinking          
of buying Lilith a brooch.      

02:22.809 --> 02:26.078
      Oh, okay, uh... see, I was
     wanting to clip the coupons

02:26.112 --> 02:28.147
    'cause I'm trying to make   
         it to my next paycheck,

02:28.181 --> 02:29.715
        but, uh, I don't want   
          to cut up your article

02:29.749 --> 02:32.885
                    on jewels   
                and diamonds.   

02:32.919 --> 02:35.054
Here's the paper,               
Woody.                          

02:35.088 --> 02:36.822
You know, Lilith and I          
are actually making             

02:36.856 --> 02:38.757
some economic concessions       
as well.                        

02:38.792 --> 02:41.527
 Well, for instance, I decided  
    not to buy that new BMW.    

02:41.561 --> 02:42.561
                        Really? 

02:42.595 --> 02:43.629
That's right.                   

02:43.663 --> 02:45.364
            So, uh,             
what are the coupons for?       

02:45.398 --> 02:48.200
                         Food.  

02:48.234 --> 02:50.069
         You know what?         

02:50.103 --> 02:51.637
 I'm going to stop talking now. 

02:53.306 --> 02:55.674
Top of the morning to you.      

02:57.344 --> 02:59.778
         So, uh, how do you like
          my outfit there, Norm?

02:59.813 --> 03:00.779
                          Cliff,

03:00.814 --> 03:02.314
    you're my friend.           

03:02.349 --> 03:05.651
I haven't judged you in the past
and I'm not going to start now. 

03:05.685 --> 03:07.986
                 Hey, uh, listen
                  up, everybody.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.321
        I've got an announcement
                to make here.   

03:09.356 --> 03:12.925
 Yours truly has been selected  
 by the USPS for a reenactment  

03:12.959 --> 03:16.795
of the first mail delivery down 
the venerable Boston Post Road. 

03:16.830 --> 03:18.931
     Yeah, I'm going to be,     
    uh, riding a horse          

03:18.965 --> 03:21.834
        on the last leg         
from Hingham to the Central P.O.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.069
          (chuckling):          
  Yeah, that's why I'm dressed  
        this way.               

03:24.104 --> 03:25.771
        What way?               

03:25.805 --> 03:30.476
      Oh, you know, this,       
this crazy looking outfit.      

03:30.510 --> 03:33.512
          Boy, are you          
     splitting hairs today.     

03:33.580 --> 03:35.381
             Cliffie, Cliff, you
             can't ride a horse.

03:35.415 --> 03:36.615
                You're afraid   
                      of horses.

03:36.649 --> 03:37.850
        How do you know?        

03:37.917 --> 03:39.284
            I know you're afraid
         of that little carousel

03:39.386 --> 03:42.621
                     in front of
                     the market.

03:42.655 --> 03:44.623
That was                        
a safety concern, Norm.         

03:44.657 --> 03:45.758
                 Is that why you
                 were screaming,

03:45.792 --> 03:48.560
              "Stop, stop, we're
              all going to die"?

03:48.595 --> 03:50.963
I was concerned                 
about the kids, Norm.           

03:50.997 --> 03:52.598
Is that so wrong?               

03:53.700 --> 03:56.135
  Boy, Cliff, I am so jealous.  

03:56.169 --> 03:57.703
     I used to love horses.     

03:57.771 --> 03:59.004
You know,                       
when I was a little girl,       

03:59.039 --> 04:02.041
every weekend                   
I would ride my pony,           

04:02.108 --> 04:04.510
 an-an-and I would feed my pony 
          sugar cubes           

04:04.544 --> 04:07.179
  and little bits of chocolate  
    and, and Snickers.          

04:07.213 --> 04:08.380
     They really like that.     

04:08.448 --> 04:11.350
And sometimes I would give      
my pony some Snickers,          

04:11.384 --> 04:14.019
      and then I would eat      
         some Snickers.         

04:14.054 --> 04:17.022
      And then other times      
I would eat all the sugar cubes 

04:17.057 --> 04:19.458
    and the chocolate           
        and the Snickers        

04:19.492 --> 04:22.394
before I ever got               
to the stable.                  

04:22.429 --> 04:24.530
    And then one time           
  my riding instructor told me  

04:24.564 --> 04:27.032
I couldn't ride my pony anymore.

04:28.535 --> 04:29.935
Why, Miss Howe?                 

04:30.036 --> 04:34.373
            Well, he said that I
             had... outgrown it.

04:36.042 --> 04:38.077
            I don't want to talk
             about this anymore.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.312
                          CLIFF:
        Well, I hope you'll all,
            uh, tune in tonight.

04:40.347 --> 04:42.414
Uh, the, uh, local news         

04:42.449 --> 04:43.949
is going to show                
my triumphant ride              

04:43.983 --> 04:45.150
to the post office.             

04:45.185 --> 04:46.385
                    (chuckling):
         Yeah, it's a big moment

04:46.419 --> 04:48.020
    for me.                     

04:48.054 --> 04:50.456
Yeah, it's, it's a high point   
of my career.                   

04:50.490 --> 04:53.692
No, it's a high point           
of my entire life.              

04:56.429 --> 04:58.397
Hey, why's Cliffie dressed      
like that?                      

04:58.431 --> 05:01.533
                      I forget. 

05:01.568 --> 05:04.470
         (sing-songy):          
             Sa-am.             

05:04.504 --> 05:06.238
              What are you doing
                down here, Hill?

05:06.272 --> 05:09.108
                Hair Club For   
                    Men meeting?

05:09.142 --> 05:12.411
Oh, I didn't see you            
down there, Miss Tortelli.      

05:12.445 --> 05:13.679
Although frankly you do...      

05:13.713 --> 05:14.680
    (sniffs)                    

05:14.714 --> 05:17.216
...announce your presence.      

05:17.250 --> 05:19.551
                    So, have you
              decided what color

05:19.586 --> 05:22.187
             you're going to dye
        your head for Easter?   

05:22.222 --> 05:25.457
Why don't you just scuttle      
under the office door           

05:25.492 --> 05:26.825
and get Sam?                    

05:26.860 --> 05:29.828
            Sam, Hill's here!   

05:29.863 --> 05:31.663
Don't tell me.                  

05:31.698 --> 05:33.232
Pizza for lunch?                

05:34.901 --> 05:36.301
        Hi, John.               

05:36.336 --> 05:37.336
        What's up?              

05:37.370 --> 05:38.737
Sa-am, we have a problem.       

05:38.838 --> 05:39.805
                    You know,   

05:39.839 --> 05:41.106
    I got to be honest          
        with you, John.         

05:41.141 --> 05:43.442
        The way you pronounce   
         my name really bugs me.

05:43.476 --> 05:45.110
How would you like me           
to pronounce it?                

05:45.145 --> 05:47.212
                  Sam, just Sam.

05:47.247 --> 05:48.247
                You try it.     

05:48.281 --> 05:50.582
         Sa-am...               

05:50.617 --> 05:53.652
                      All right,
                     John, uh...

05:53.687 --> 05:56.488
  what would you say if you were
  going to order a ham sandwich?

05:56.556 --> 05:59.124
     I don't eat ha-am.         

05:59.159 --> 06:00.926
                    Never mind. 

06:00.960 --> 06:02.895
                     What, what 
                do you want?    

06:02.929 --> 06:05.964
My busboy informs me            
that the Dumpsters are full.    

06:05.999 --> 06:07.499
                Our Dumpsters   
                    are full.   

06:07.534 --> 06:08.634
                      What's the
                    big problem?

06:08.668 --> 06:09.601
              Aha!              

06:09.669 --> 06:11.136
  They are not <i>our</i> Dumpsters.   

06:11.171 --> 06:13.005
     They are <i>my</i> Dumpsters.     

06:13.039 --> 06:14.740
If that's confusing,            

06:14.774 --> 06:16.542
perhaps I'll have               
a likeness of your face         

06:16.576 --> 06:20.045
painted on the Dumpster with    
a bold line drawn through it.   

06:20.113 --> 06:24.817
In fact, I'll do that anyway... 
    just for a giggle.          

06:24.851 --> 06:27.186
Perhaps                         
I'll have buttons made up.      

06:27.253 --> 06:29.154
I'll make it a whole thing.     

06:29.222 --> 06:32.658
Hey, Hill, you can't order us   
around like that.               

06:32.692 --> 06:34.893
Sammy can do anything he wants  
with his trash.                 

06:34.928 --> 06:37.996
        Yes, I see today he's   
      dressed it up in an apron.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.701
I guess you know all about      
dressing up, huh, Hill?         

06:45.905 --> 06:47.873
                Sam, if any more
                  of your refuse

06:47.907 --> 06:50.175
is deposited in my Dumpsters,   
          I'll have them emptied

06:50.210 --> 06:51.443
in the center                   
of this bar,                    

06:51.478 --> 06:52.878
and if it happens               
again,                          

06:52.912 --> 06:55.647
    I'll do something           
  your customers will notice.   

06:59.452 --> 07:01.420
    Can you believe that guy?   

07:01.454 --> 07:04.323
            Him and his niggling
     little nit-picking details.

07:04.357 --> 07:05.357
    I mean, who cares           

07:05.392 --> 07:06.859
if I stick stuff                
in his Dumpster?                

07:06.893 --> 07:08.027
                    Actually,   
                          Sammy,

07:08.061 --> 07:09.428
             you know, Dumpsters
        are kind of expensive   

07:09.562 --> 07:11.397
          to maintain and empty.

07:11.464 --> 07:14.066
He's been kind of generous to   
let you use them for so long.   

07:14.100 --> 07:16.435
            After all, the guy's
             running a business.

07:16.503 --> 07:18.237
Good point, Norm, good point.   

07:18.338 --> 07:20.973
Speaking of business,           

07:21.007 --> 07:24.243
w-w-what do you think           
we ought to do about, uh,       

07:24.277 --> 07:26.345
    your bar tab here, hmm?     

07:28.014 --> 07:30.482
            We could throw it   
            in <i>our</i> Dumpsters.   

07:38.992 --> 07:41.560
Hey, Miss Howe, Mr. Hill put    
a lock on the Dumpster.         

07:41.594 --> 07:43.228
What should I do with this?     

07:43.263 --> 07:44.630
            Well, just set it   
                 down someplace.

07:44.764 --> 07:46.699
         All right.             

07:49.669 --> 07:52.404
  Cliffie, you want to, uh, pass
     me the sports page, please?

07:52.439 --> 07:54.506
Mr. Peterson,                   
that's just a bag of garbage    

07:54.541 --> 07:55.974
you're talking to.              

07:56.042 --> 07:58.243
          Come here, Woody.     

07:58.278 --> 07:59.645
             Maybe if we all cut
              Cliff a little bit

07:59.713 --> 08:01.914
        of slack, he wouldn't be
        such a "bag of garbage,"

08:01.948 --> 08:03.882
          as you put it, okay?  

08:07.287 --> 08:08.420
                  Do you believe
                    that guy?   

08:08.455 --> 08:11.123
    He stuck a padlock          
    on our Dumpsters.           

08:11.191 --> 08:12.391
 You know, just once, just once 

08:12.425 --> 08:15.494
I would like to do something    
to really stick it to him.      

08:15.562 --> 08:16.862
                Sammy, forget   
                    about it.   

08:16.896 --> 08:18.997
                    You'll never
                  beat that guy.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.766
Hmm, you're right.              

08:20.800 --> 08:22.034
Who am I kidding?               

08:22.068 --> 08:23.268
I'm no match                    
for that guy.                   

08:23.303 --> 08:24.737
He's too evil.                  

08:26.806 --> 08:29.041
What am I thinking? Wha...?!    

08:29.075 --> 08:30.976
All this time,                  
there's somebody in this bar    

08:31.011 --> 08:33.979
who's so mean, so nasty,        
so full of hate                 

08:34.014 --> 08:36.448
that they could take on Hill    
in one second.                  

08:36.482 --> 08:39.183
    Well, I don't know, Sam,    
  I'm kind of busy right now.   

08:40.687 --> 08:43.087
What about Carla?               
She can be pretty mean.         

08:43.123 --> 08:45.557
  Good idea, Woody, good idea.  

08:45.592 --> 08:47.459
    Carla, come here,           
      I got a job for you.      

08:47.494 --> 08:49.194
Yeah, what do you want me to do?

08:49.229 --> 08:50.996
                I want you to   
                get even for me.

08:51.031 --> 08:54.266
     I want you to take all your
meanness, all your nastiness,   

08:54.300 --> 08:55.668
                     and unleash
                it on that...   

08:55.702 --> 09:00.172
            knobby-headed weasel
                John Allen Hill.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.274
You want                        
I should make him cry?          

09:02.308 --> 09:03.242
                        Yeah.   

09:04.277 --> 09:06.979
                 That's perfect.

09:07.013 --> 09:09.348
                  Yeah, make the
                 little man cry.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.382
     Yeah!                      

09:10.417 --> 09:12.584
Consider it done.               

09:12.619 --> 09:14.653
 Yeah, right, now, how are you  
     going to make him cry?     

09:14.688 --> 09:17.556
        You don't think         
    I can make somebody cry?    

09:17.624 --> 09:19.391
     No, actually, I don't.     

09:23.196 --> 09:25.964
Maybe you're right.             

09:28.535 --> 09:30.636
    Uh, say, Rebecca.           

09:30.670 --> 09:32.037
                Mm-hmm?         
When you were                   

09:32.072 --> 09:35.507
a little girl, why <i>did</i> you      
stop riding that pony?          

09:37.510 --> 09:40.913
    Was it because              
    you got too fat?            

09:40.980 --> 09:44.183
Just too damned fat?            

09:44.217 --> 09:48.687
So damned fat you broke         
the back of a horse?            

09:50.890 --> 09:51.857
What's the matter, Becks?       

09:51.891 --> 09:54.360
Your eyes seem a little shiny.  

09:54.394 --> 09:56.462
    (quavering): It's just an   
        allergy or something.   

09:57.997 --> 10:01.166
                      (sobbing):
            If anybody needs me,
        I'll be in my office.   

10:09.376 --> 10:11.777
        You know, I really like 
            Cheetos, but, uh... 

10:11.811 --> 10:13.345
Orange fingers?                 

10:15.782 --> 10:17.549
    I hate that, too.           

10:17.584 --> 10:20.052
At home I use a great big spoon.

10:20.086 --> 10:21.987
         I'll try that.         

10:24.724 --> 10:26.692
          What's this?          

10:26.726 --> 10:28.494
    Oh, that's a flier          
that Mr. Clavin wanted me       

10:28.528 --> 10:30.195
to pass around to the customers.

10:30.230 --> 10:31.730
Well, why didn't you?           

10:31.765 --> 10:33.599
      Because it's a flier      
that Mr. Clavin wanted me       

10:33.633 --> 10:35.501
to pass around to the customers.

10:35.535 --> 10:38.170
    We've had trouble           
      in that area before.      

10:38.204 --> 10:39.338
                "Tune in tonight

10:39.372 --> 10:42.074

            Hey, it's right now.

10:50.750 --> 10:51.917
                  Let's tune in.

10:51.951 --> 10:53.752
 Oh, this is a great            
 <i>Barnaby Jones,</i> though.         

10:53.787 --> 10:55.921
 This is the one where he goes  
    undercover as a swinger     

10:55.955 --> 10:58.023
    to solve a jewel heist.     

10:58.058 --> 10:59.291
                Well, we'll, uh,
            flip back and forth.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.360
     All right.                 

11:01.394 --> 11:03.762
        ANNOUNCER:              
     The crowd here at the      
 Central Post Office is waiting 

11:03.797 --> 11:06.065
    for letter carrier          
        Clifford Clavin,        

11:06.099 --> 11:08.934
    who we understand           
is an award-winning equestrian. 

11:11.071 --> 11:13.038
        Mr. Clavin seems        
    to be running late          

11:13.073 --> 11:15.808
      and his whereabouts       
     are currently unknown.     

11:15.842 --> 11:16.942
        In other news...        

11:16.976 --> 11:19.011
Ooh, I hope everything's okay   
with Cliffie.                   

11:19.045 --> 11:21.313
So, uh, Barnaby's a swinger?    
                Ha, wait till   

11:21.348 --> 11:25.417
you see him. He wears           
hip-huggers, gold               
chains, platform shoes.         

11:25.452 --> 11:29.855
        (phone ringing)         

11:29.889 --> 11:31.890
    Cheers.                     

11:31.925 --> 11:33.792
Oh, yeah, hang on,              
just a second.                  

11:33.827 --> 11:35.427
Hey, Mr. Peterson,              
it's Mr. Clavin.                

11:38.498 --> 11:39.999
    Cliffie, where are you?     

11:40.033 --> 11:42.468
      I don't know, Norm,       
 somewhere in the combat zone.  

11:42.502 --> 11:44.770
Naked! Naked! Naked!            

11:44.804 --> 11:46.605
              Hey, Norm, you got
             to come and get me.

11:46.639 --> 11:48.207
    This horse has got          
    a mind of its own.          

11:48.308 --> 11:49.975
(horn honks, horse neighs)      
             Whoa!              

11:50.010 --> 11:51.844
        (tires screech)         

11:52.912 --> 11:55.814
  Man... Cliffie's in trouble.  

11:55.849 --> 11:57.983
I better go look for him.       

11:58.018 --> 12:01.286
    Shoot, they never           
      rerun this episode.       

12:02.756 --> 12:04.523
    I don't think I've seen     
    the ending of this one.     

12:04.591 --> 12:06.658
         The jewels are         
      in the dog's collar.      

12:06.693 --> 12:08.627
      Oh. Thank you, Phil.      

12:10.630 --> 12:11.930
 Gee, Carla, you were up there  
        with Hill               

12:11.965 --> 12:13.032
  a long time. What happened?   

12:13.066 --> 12:14.867
                 I don't want to
                  talk about it.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.101
            Hey, what did you   
                     say to him?

12:16.136 --> 12:18.170
      Just shut up and get      
out of my way, you stupid,      

12:18.204 --> 12:20.239
     dirt-eating farm boy!      

12:22.342 --> 12:25.177
      Ouch! I'd hate to be      
 on the receiving end of that.  

12:30.917 --> 12:33.318
            (sighs)             

12:33.353 --> 12:34.720
    What is going on?           

12:34.854 --> 12:37.089
In this bar?                    
I don't ask.                    

12:38.591 --> 12:40.526
            (grunts)            

12:42.062 --> 12:43.796
  Now, apparently you're upset  
        over something.         

12:45.899 --> 12:47.499
            (grunts)            

12:47.534 --> 12:50.903
Or not, I don't know            
you that well.                  

12:50.937 --> 12:52.871
  Carla, now just, just relax   
      and try to breathe.       

12:52.906 --> 12:53.939
      Just breathe.             

12:53.973 --> 12:55.941
         (deep breaths)         

12:57.811 --> 13:00.145
All right, now is it            
out of your system?             

13:00.180 --> 13:02.581
All right,                      
now talk to us.                 

13:02.615 --> 13:04.183
        (screams)               
                      No, Carla!

13:04.217 --> 13:06.151
          Carla!                
        (grunting)              

13:07.420 --> 13:09.555
                 Carla, what has
                gotten into you?

13:09.589 --> 13:12.191
         First of all,          
      you have to promise       

13:12.225 --> 13:13.926
to never repeat this to anybody.

13:13.993 --> 13:15.761
                        I swear.
That goes without saying.       

13:15.795 --> 13:19.698
Okay. I just did a really,      
really, really bad thing.       

13:19.733 --> 13:21.567
 When I was up there with Hill, 

13:21.601 --> 13:23.302
          I just kind           
        of lost control.        

13:23.370 --> 13:25.404
                        (gasps):
      You didn't break something
      really expensive, did you?

13:25.438 --> 13:26.472
        Oh, no, worse than that.

13:26.506 --> 13:28.007
Did you hurt him?               
                    Worse.      

13:28.041 --> 13:30.075
Oh, no, did he have             
a heart attack?                 
                      No, worse.

13:30.110 --> 13:31.276
                 Oh, he's dead?!

13:31.311 --> 13:33.245
         Oh, you guys!          
    You don't get it!           

13:33.279 --> 13:35.180
    I didn't kill him.          

13:35.215 --> 13:36.849
    I slept with him.           

13:36.883 --> 13:38.784
             Yikes.             

13:49.496 --> 13:51.263
     You had sex with Hill?     

13:52.899 --> 13:55.134
        John Allen Hill?        

13:55.168 --> 13:57.469
Upstairs John Allen Hill?       

13:57.504 --> 13:59.638
                It was so crazy.

13:59.673 --> 14:01.306
    I marched into his office   

14:01.341 --> 14:04.209
    and I started calling him   
              bald and wrinkled.

14:04.244 --> 14:07.012
          And he started calling
              me short and ugly.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.682
        And before I knew it,   
            our clothes were off

14:09.716 --> 14:11.283
                     and we were
            insulting each other

14:11.317 --> 14:13.352
     against the filing cabinet.

14:15.155 --> 14:17.489
    But Carla, I mean he is,    
        he's a...               

14:17.524 --> 14:18.991
    You know what I call him?   

14:19.059 --> 14:21.427
          The Bullet.           

14:25.031 --> 14:28.734
      Carla, I, I believe       
  I understand what happened.   

14:28.768 --> 14:30.202
     You two have a classic     

14:30.236 --> 14:32.471
      attraction/repulsion      
         relationship.          

14:32.505 --> 14:34.773
  It's really a fairly common   
          phenomenon.           

14:34.841 --> 14:37.209
People who are constantly       
    at odds with one another    

14:37.243 --> 14:40.713
     very often have rivers     
 of passion raging between them 

14:40.780 --> 14:42.815
until one day                   
the banks overflow              

14:42.849 --> 14:45.818
     in a torrent of unthinking,
        unreasonable emotion.   

14:45.852 --> 14:49.822
Plus the guy's practically      
        a contortionist.        

14:53.560 --> 14:57.329
I can't believe I did this.     

14:57.364 --> 14:58.664
I betrayed Sam.                 

14:58.698 --> 15:00.065
I went up there                 

15:00.200 --> 15:02.601
  to take on his worst enemy,   

15:02.635 --> 15:04.970
     and I ended up having      
    a nooner with him.          

15:10.944 --> 15:14.713
     Oh, I just hope Sammy      
  doesn't find out about this.  

15:14.781 --> 15:16.682
                      Oh, Carla,
                    you're going

15:16.750 --> 15:18.283
                 to have to face
            Sam sooner or later.

15:18.318 --> 15:19.651
         He's bound to find out.

15:19.686 --> 15:20.853
Yeah, Lilith's right.           

15:20.887 --> 15:23.188
  Yeah, I guess you're right.   

15:24.524 --> 15:27.659
     Okay. Well, I'll just      
    catch Sam tonight           

15:27.694 --> 15:30.662
when nobody else is around      
  and I'll tell him the truth.  

15:32.198 --> 15:34.433
I'll tell him that what happened
 with Hill was a one-time thing 

15:34.467 --> 15:36.335
 and it'll never happen again.  

15:36.369 --> 15:37.903
                    Unless...   

15:37.937 --> 15:40.139
         I accidentally         
    catch a glimpse of those    

15:40.173 --> 15:42.441
wiry, bantam legs of his.       

15:51.685 --> 15:53.052
      Evening, everybody.       

15:53.086 --> 15:54.253
              ALL:              
             Norm!              

15:54.287 --> 15:55.320
          Hey, Mr. P.           

15:55.355 --> 15:56.789
      How goes the search       
        for Mr. Clavin?         

15:56.823 --> 15:58.724
Not as well as the search       
    for Mr. Doughnut.           

15:59.893 --> 16:01.660
            I found him every   
            couple of blocks.   

16:02.896 --> 16:04.830
    (sighs)                     

16:04.864 --> 16:06.031
Poor Mr. Clavin.                

16:06.066 --> 16:07.466
Who knows what                  
happened to him.                

16:07.500 --> 16:09.034
      I'm kind of worried       
    about him, really.          

16:09.069 --> 16:10.469
Why don't you give me the phone?

16:10.503 --> 16:12.771
        I'll check the hospitals
      or something, shouldn't I?

16:12.806 --> 16:15.140
            Uh, Mass General?   

16:15.175 --> 16:16.575
Hey, Normie, I got dish.        

16:16.609 --> 16:18.444
             I'll call you back.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.446
It's about Carla                
and that Hill upstairs.         

16:20.480 --> 16:21.547
        Yeah? Spill it. What?   

16:21.581 --> 16:24.049
     (whispers)                 

16:24.084 --> 16:25.551
                Eeww!           

16:25.585 --> 16:26.785
    Frasier, Frasier,           

16:26.820 --> 16:28.153
did you hear about              
Carla and Hill?                 

16:28.188 --> 16:30.222
          Did I hear?           
  Who do you think told Paul?   

16:31.991 --> 16:33.992
            Wow, Carla and Hill.

16:34.027 --> 16:35.627
                I saw it coming.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.696
You didn't have                 
to be Kreskin.                  

16:39.833 --> 16:42.267
Frasier, I cannot believe       
that you revealed               

16:42.302 --> 16:44.870
what is essentially             
a professional confidence.      

16:44.904 --> 16:46.772
          Sweetheart,           
    did she pay you a dime?     

16:46.806 --> 16:48.707
        No.                     

16:48.742 --> 16:50.476
     Then why are we having     
        this discussion?        

16:52.312 --> 16:53.879
What's everybody talking about? 

16:53.913 --> 16:56.515
        Woody, when, uh,        
      Carla went upstairs       

16:56.549 --> 16:58.350
     to, to see Hill today,     
        she, uh...              

16:58.418 --> 17:00.719
well, they...                   

17:00.754 --> 17:02.688
did the deed,                   
you know what I mean?           

17:02.756 --> 17:05.156
            I'm not following   
                 you, Dr. Crane.

17:05.191 --> 17:07.092
Carla and Hill,                 

17:07.127 --> 17:09.194
they rocked                     
each other's world.             

17:10.763 --> 17:12.064
They thumped.                   

17:12.098 --> 17:13.932
                     What?      

17:13.967 --> 17:15.667
    They had sex.               

17:15.702 --> 17:17.435
Carla and Hill had sex.         

17:17.470 --> 17:18.837
      What?                     

17:18.972 --> 17:19.938
         Come on, Sam.          

17:19.973 --> 17:21.473
    Even I got it that time.    

17:22.909 --> 17:24.576
             Carla?             

17:26.246 --> 17:28.146
                     Wh...      

17:28.181 --> 17:29.882
     Are you all happy now?     

17:29.916 --> 17:32.618
         Your gossiping         
      and rumor-mongering       

17:32.652 --> 17:34.353
is resulting                    
in a possible rift              

17:34.387 --> 17:36.121
between Carla and Sam.          

17:36.156 --> 17:37.222
Rather than allow her           

17:37.290 --> 17:39.158
the time and space              
to open up to Sam               

17:39.192 --> 17:41.260
     in her own good time,      
you all have been behaving      

17:41.294 --> 17:42.861
  like a gaggle of fishwives.   

17:42.929 --> 17:44.563
                  Well, hey, you
            blabbed first, girl.

17:46.666 --> 17:49.668
      Sammy, I don't know       
    what to tell you.           

17:51.671 --> 17:55.140
I guess... all the insults      
and the venom,                  

17:55.175 --> 17:56.742
and the blood hatred just       

17:56.810 --> 17:58.143
kind of turned us on.           

17:58.244 --> 18:00.779
      It's the old story.       

18:02.482 --> 18:04.216
            Guess so.           

18:04.250 --> 18:06.919
Oh, Sammy, I let you down.      

18:06.953 --> 18:08.721
    I slept with the enemy.     

18:09.856 --> 18:10.989
Please forgive me.              

18:11.024 --> 18:12.057
Please don't be angry.          

18:12.092 --> 18:13.592
              No, I'm not angry.

18:13.626 --> 18:17.496
          It's just... well, the
             way I see it, uh...

18:17.530 --> 18:18.831
    you let down the whole team.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.868
            It's like, you know,
            bottom of the ninth,

18:22.902 --> 18:25.471
    one out, runner on first,   

18:25.505 --> 18:26.939
            you're up at bat.   

18:27.007 --> 18:29.274
        Coach tells you to bunt.

18:29.309 --> 18:32.144
    Team expects you to bunt,   

18:32.178 --> 18:34.580
             the runner on first
            expects you to bunt,

18:34.614 --> 18:36.915
        fans expect you to bunt.

18:36.950 --> 18:38.951
    But instead of bunting...   

18:38.985 --> 18:42.621
you sleep with John Allen Hill! 

18:42.655 --> 18:44.456
         No! No!                
                    Hey!        

18:44.524 --> 18:45.758
         Take it easy!          

18:45.792 --> 18:47.593
 You're supposed to forgive me. 

18:47.627 --> 18:48.694
How can I forgive you?!         

18:48.728 --> 18:51.563
You slept with that             
evil, little dwarf!             

18:51.598 --> 18:54.767
     Is it my fault the guy     
    is such a turn-on?          

18:54.834 --> 18:56.502
Oh, stop-- oh, yuck,            
yuck! Oh, God!                  

18:56.536 --> 18:57.936
            Stop it! Stop!      

18:57.971 --> 18:59.438
I have never once               
said anything                   

18:59.472 --> 19:00.973
about anyone you have           
ever slept with!                

19:01.007 --> 19:02.841
                      Oh, right!
              What about Diane?!

19:02.876 --> 19:04.309
            Every morning you   
             threatened to stick

19:04.344 --> 19:06.378
        a hand grenade in her   
         mouth and pull the pin!

19:06.413 --> 19:07.446
                  You hated her!

19:07.480 --> 19:09.915
     I disapproved of her.      

19:09.949 --> 19:12.217
      Oh, come on, Carla,       
         you hated her!         

19:12.252 --> 19:13.252
    You hate everyone!          

19:13.286 --> 19:14.486
        That's not fair!        

19:14.621 --> 19:15.888
        Oh, right!              
      I'm sorry, I forgot.      

19:15.922 --> 19:18.323
         You don't hate         
        John Allen Hill!        

19:20.493 --> 19:21.627
        That's it!              

19:21.661 --> 19:23.996
That's it, thanks a lot         
for your forgiveness!           

19:24.030 --> 19:25.364
        I'm out of here!        

19:26.466 --> 19:28.467
        (groaning)              

19:30.103 --> 19:31.036
Oh, dear.                       
        (faucet running)        

19:31.071 --> 19:32.471
              Sam.              

19:32.505 --> 19:33.639
         What, Woody?!          

19:33.773 --> 19:35.307
You're angry, aren't you?       

19:35.342 --> 19:37.943
          Yeah! I am!           

19:37.977 --> 19:40.112
                You're hurt.    
                You're down.    

19:40.146 --> 19:41.313
    You're confused, aren't you?

19:41.381 --> 19:43.982
    Yeah. Yeah, I am.           

19:44.017 --> 19:45.651
            Yeah. I was, too,   

19:45.685 --> 19:47.453
                  the first time
            I made this mistake.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.322
                  Just remember,
                  the men's room

19:50.357 --> 19:52.291
              is the second door
                    on the left.

19:57.997 --> 19:59.231
        Hey, everybody.         

19:59.265 --> 20:00.532
             PAUL:              
Hey, Cliffie, you're back.      

20:00.567 --> 20:01.900
            You deliver that    
        letter all right?       

20:02.035 --> 20:03.168
 Yeah, it took a little doing.  

20:03.203 --> 20:05.270
But I, uh, finally delivered it.

20:05.305 --> 20:07.072
    It was three hours late.    

20:07.107 --> 20:08.874
          You know, but it turns
              out, that the, uh,

20:08.908 --> 20:10.843
             original letter was
    three weeks late, so, uh,   

20:10.877 --> 20:13.379
             I was able to shave
              a little time off.

20:15.382 --> 20:16.615
            Where's Norm, Woods?

20:16.649 --> 20:18.017
He's out looking for you.       

20:18.051 --> 20:19.418
                    Oh, boy.    
        (TV switches on)        

20:19.452 --> 20:21.286
          All right, I guess I'd
             better go find him.

20:21.321 --> 20:22.654
      (channels switching)      

20:22.689 --> 20:24.123
        Hey, look, it's         
      that <i>Cannon</i> episode       

20:24.157 --> 20:26.125
          where he dresses up as
     a pimp to save the runaway.

20:28.895 --> 20:29.995
Norm's a big boy.               

20:30.030 --> 20:31.397
He can take care                
of himself.                     

20:34.167 --> 20:37.403
Naked! Naked! Naked!            

20:37.437 --> 20:39.138
             Excuse me, I'm, uh,
            looking for a guy   

20:39.172 --> 20:42.007
        wearing a funny costume,
                 riding a horse.

20:42.042 --> 20:43.909
Try the place two doors down.   

20:43.943 --> 20:44.877
                      Okay.     

20:46.146 --> 20:47.813
             Freak.             

20:47.847 --> 20:50.315
      Naked! Naked! Naked!      

20:50.350 --> 20:51.316
        (doorbell rings)        

20:51.351 --> 20:52.718
                          CARLA:
                         Coming.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.687
            Coming.             

20:56.256 --> 20:57.222
        Who is it?              

20:57.257 --> 20:59.258
                            Sam.

21:01.795 --> 21:03.462
          Hey.                  
                        Hey.    

21:04.531 --> 21:05.964
            How're you doing?   

21:07.534 --> 21:08.834
                  Fine, and you?

21:08.868 --> 21:10.769
      Fine.                     

21:10.804 --> 21:12.971
So, uh, where are the kids?     

21:13.006 --> 21:14.039
    How should I know?          

21:14.074 --> 21:16.141
        It's only 1:30.         

21:20.213 --> 21:23.048
I, uh... I came                 
to apologize.                   

21:24.250 --> 21:25.584
        I blew up.              

21:25.618 --> 21:27.486
  You know, you've got to know  
    I didn't mean any           

21:27.520 --> 21:29.254
of that stuff.                  
It's just...                    

21:29.289 --> 21:30.889
    ah, that Hill guy, man.     

21:30.924 --> 21:33.525
        Something about him just
             makes me act crazy.

21:35.762 --> 21:37.162
Nah, forget it.                 

21:37.197 --> 21:38.263
I forgive you.                  

21:38.298 --> 21:39.965
I know you didn't               
mean that stuff.                

21:40.000 --> 21:41.834
                    Oh, honey...

21:41.868 --> 21:43.602
I just hope you can forgive me. 

21:43.636 --> 21:45.337
      Oh, of course I can.      
    Come on, you don't think    

21:45.372 --> 21:47.206
    I'd let that stuff          
get in between us, do you?      

21:47.240 --> 21:48.374
          You're my best friend.

21:48.408 --> 21:51.110
Oh, Sammy, you're               
my best friend, too.            

21:52.746 --> 21:54.146
      Oh, I know what it's like.

21:54.180 --> 21:57.282
     It's probably just...      
  one of those things, right?   

21:57.317 --> 22:00.019
    Exactly, it was just one    
        of those things.        
                        Yeah.   

22:00.053 --> 22:01.286
              I've been thinking
                     about this.

22:01.321 --> 22:02.554
              I'll tell you what
                I'm going to do.

22:02.589 --> 22:04.289
    Tomorrow morning,           
      I'm going to go up,       

22:04.324 --> 22:06.225
I'm gonna talk to Hill          
calmly, you know,               

22:06.259 --> 22:08.794
and ask him nicely, maybe I     
could use the Dumpster          

22:08.828 --> 22:10.129
until I can buy                 
one for myself.                 

22:10.163 --> 22:12.398
I swear to God I'll do it       
    bright and early.           

22:12.432 --> 22:14.800
Well, not too early, Sam.       

22:20.006 --> 22:22.808
I have a feeling I may          
be in a little late.            

22:24.377 --> 22:28.447
            Okay, so it was just
            two of those things.
