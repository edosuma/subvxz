WEBVTT

00:00.799 --> 00:04.411
I want every single person
we took from that damned Gulch.

00:07.458 --> 00:08.981
I found this
in Cameron's hand.

00:09.025 --> 00:10.461
from the pattern, I think,
it's from the grip

00:10.504 --> 00:12.332
on the knife handle.

00:12.376 --> 00:14.813
Everything I've done,
I've done so that we could all

00:14.856 --> 00:18.338
be back together, and it doesn't
work if it's not all of us.

00:18.382 --> 00:20.210
Dakota is welcome.

00:20.253 --> 00:24.518
I can't stay here. If I do,
I'm not gonna last long.

00:24.562 --> 00:25.954
You can't just leave.

00:25.998 --> 00:29.436
I don't wanna leave.
I don't wanna run anymore.

00:31.699 --> 00:35.529
<i>I wouldn't do that if I were you, John.</i>

00:35.573 --> 00:37.401
<i>It'll do you no good.</i>

00:37.444 --> 00:39.838
<i>The mayor has policemen downstairs</i>

00:39.881 --> 00:41.622
<i>with instructions
to remove</i>

00:41.666 --> 00:44.843
<i>all marks of identification you may have on your person.</i>

00:44.886 --> 00:48.107
<i>You'll be buried
in Potter's Field,</i>

00:48.151 --> 00:50.196
<i>and you will have accomplished nothing.</i>

00:51.980 --> 00:54.287
<i>I've taken care
of that.</i>

00:54.331 --> 00:57.334
<i>I've already mailed
a copy of this letter</i>

00:57.377 --> 00:58.465
<i>to Mr. Connell.</i>

01:01.164 --> 01:04.515
<i>John, why don't you forget this foolishness?</i>

01:04.558 --> 01:06.560
<i>Stop right where you are,
Mr. Norton,</i>

01:06.604 --> 01:08.954
<i>if you don't want
to go overboard with me.</i>

01:08.997 --> 01:12.305
<i>I'm glad
you gentlemen are here.</i>

01:12.349 --> 01:15.134
<i>You've killed the John Doe movement, alright,</i>

01:15.178 --> 01:19.356
<i>but you're going to see it born
all over again.</i>

01:19.399 --> 01:23.925
<i>John! John!</i>

01:33.326 --> 01:35.937
<i>We'll start all over again,
just you and I.</i>

01:35.981 --> 01:37.330
<i>It isn't too late.</i>

01:37.374 --> 01:39.637
<i>The John Doe movement
isn't dead yet.</i>

01:39.680 --> 01:41.160
<i>See, John!</i>

01:41.204 --> 01:42.683
<i>It isn't dead,
or they wouldn't be here!</i>

01:42.727 --> 01:44.337
<i>It's alive in them.</i>

01:44.381 --> 01:46.339
<i>They kept it alive
by being afraid of it.</i>

01:46.383 --> 01:48.341
<i>That's why
they came up here.</i>

01:48.385 --> 01:49.821
<i>Oh, darling.</i>

01:49.864 --> 01:51.562
<i>Sure, it should have been
killed before.</i>

01:51.605 --> 01:52.824
<i>It was dishonest.</i>

01:52.867 --> 01:54.565
<i>But we can
start clean now.</i>

01:54.608 --> 01:57.176
<i>Just you and I.
It'll grow again, John.</i>

01:57.220 --> 01:58.699
<i>It'll grow big.</i>

01:58.743 --> 02:00.962
<i>And it'll be strong
because it'll be honest.</i>

02:01.006 --> 02:05.271
<i>Oh, darling,
if it's worth dying for,</i>

02:05.315 --> 02:07.012
<i>it's worth living for.</i>

02:07.055 --> 02:08.361
<i>Oh, please, John!</i>

02:12.060 --> 02:15.194
<i>Oh, please, God, help me.</i>

02:39.523 --> 02:42.221
I'm sorry.

04:38.903 --> 04:41.253
Hey!

04:52.960 --> 04:55.702
Snuck up on me.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.593
Hey, I don't want no trouble.

05:17.855 --> 05:21.337
But if it's trouble <i>you</i> want,
I got something for you.

05:50.670 --> 05:51.715
Ohh!

05:51.758 --> 05:53.107
John.
Dakota?

05:54.457 --> 05:56.372
What -- What in the hell
are you doing here?

05:56.415 --> 06:00.419
Uh, I'm -- I'm running
from my sister.

06:00.463 --> 06:01.768
You?

06:01.812 --> 06:04.771
Well, I guess you could say
the same thing.

06:04.815 --> 06:08.601
You the one that corralledthose passed on the bridge?

06:08.645 --> 06:10.821
No, uh...

06:10.864 --> 06:12.779
He did.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.915
Ah.

06:20.091 --> 06:21.658
Hey, John.

06:23.616 --> 06:26.097
Well,
I'll be damned.

06:26.140 --> 06:27.838
How'd you find us?
I didn't.

06:27.881 --> 06:29.056
The passed
on the bridge,

06:29.100 --> 06:30.275
they kept washing upnear my cabin,

06:30.318 --> 06:32.233
and, well,this river has a way

06:32.277 --> 06:34.453
of bringing people
back to life.

06:34.497 --> 06:37.064
But I gotta say, buddy,you've looked better.

06:37.108 --> 06:38.588
Mm-hmm.

06:38.631 --> 06:42.243
Getting across the bridge,
putting the barricade up,

06:42.287 --> 06:44.463
trapping the dead,
his wound had opened up.

06:44.507 --> 06:46.726
But I patched it up
as best as I could.

06:46.770 --> 06:48.685
Good job.

06:50.513 --> 06:52.689
We heard the shot at the Gulch
that night.

06:52.732 --> 06:54.168
We didn't think
you made it, man.

06:54.212 --> 06:55.822
Neither did I.

06:55.866 --> 06:57.476
How'd you survive?

06:57.520 --> 06:59.913
Had some help.
Who from?

06:59.957 --> 07:01.915
That night?
I don't know.

07:01.959 --> 07:04.657
I came to,
I was already patched up,

07:04.701 --> 07:06.311
but they'd moved on.

07:06.354 --> 07:09.706
Somebody else helped me out
a while later.

07:09.749 --> 07:14.493
But now I'm gonna have to
add her to the list.

07:14.537 --> 07:15.842
It wasn't hard.

07:15.886 --> 07:17.496
Somebody stocked
the shelves

07:17.540 --> 07:19.019
with everything
I needed, so...

07:19.063 --> 07:20.325
Yeah.

07:20.368 --> 07:23.676
It's good to see you,
John.

07:23.720 --> 07:26.592
I feel like
I'm looking at a ghost.

07:26.636 --> 07:28.376
Oh, you are.

07:28.420 --> 07:30.814
How'd you wind up
with that big herd on your tail?

07:30.857 --> 07:33.686
Virginia set her rangers
on us.

07:33.730 --> 07:36.515
We were trying to outrun them
with Alicia and Charlie,

07:36.559 --> 07:38.648
but we hit the herd,
got separated.

07:38.691 --> 07:40.563
We should
start looking for them.

07:40.606 --> 07:42.826
She's right. We should
get back on the road and
get ourselves there.

07:42.869 --> 07:44.262
Just hang on,
hang on.

07:44.305 --> 07:46.090
You're not going anywhere,
at least not like that.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.918
Where are you
trying to go?

07:47.961 --> 07:49.920
He's got a place
that he's building.

07:49.963 --> 07:51.791
One that's safe.
Shh.

07:53.401 --> 07:55.316
Hide that stuff.
Clean it up.

07:55.360 --> 07:56.883
Come on, Morgan.

08:03.760 --> 08:06.066
Dakota!

08:06.110 --> 08:08.329
Dakota.

08:21.778 --> 08:23.127
Anybody home?

09:22.447 --> 09:23.753
Hill, you copy?

09:26.843 --> 09:28.801
You are not
gonna believe this.

09:28.845 --> 09:30.020
Do it.

09:30.063 --> 09:31.935
Hey, Hill.

09:31.978 --> 09:34.764
Ranger Dorie?
I think he's been here.

09:34.807 --> 09:36.026
Now.

09:36.069 --> 09:38.463
Marcus.
Do you copy?

09:38.506 --> 09:40.378
I didn't catch that.

09:42.598 --> 09:44.600
Damn walkie.

09:45.992 --> 09:48.429
Standby.
I'm coming for higher ground.

10:05.882 --> 10:10.843
He's gone.

10:13.150 --> 10:15.500
You should have
shot him.

10:15.543 --> 10:17.067
I didn't need to.

10:17.110 --> 10:19.765
These times,
John.

10:22.507 --> 10:26.642
They make us men
we tried so hard not to be.

10:26.685 --> 10:28.252
Let's get out of here.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.689
We'll be safer
at my cabin.

10:39.132 --> 10:41.700
How'd you learn
to cook like this?

10:41.744 --> 10:44.268
Well, I spent every summer
out here when I was a kid.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.270
When in Rome.

10:46.313 --> 10:49.055
Well,
that's no good.

10:50.970 --> 10:55.061
Place we're going
is built on a dry riverbed.

10:55.105 --> 10:57.716
Water nearby,
plenty of fish.

10:57.760 --> 10:59.283
Be nice
to have somebody out there

10:59.326 --> 11:01.894
who knows
how to cook 'em.

11:01.938 --> 11:03.243
Come on.

11:03.287 --> 11:05.898
June can cook 'em
just as good as me.

11:05.942 --> 11:08.901
Better, maybe.

11:11.861 --> 11:13.906
How long
you been out here?

11:13.950 --> 11:15.908
Couple of weeks.

11:15.952 --> 11:18.084
And where's June?

11:18.128 --> 11:19.651
Why is she
not with you?

11:21.305 --> 11:23.699
It's not
worth talking about.

11:23.742 --> 11:25.265
Oh, it's not?

11:25.309 --> 11:27.311
Where is this place
you're settling?

11:29.400 --> 11:31.315
Alright.

11:31.358 --> 11:34.100
40 miles north.

11:35.362 --> 11:38.104
That's a ways to go
on foot.

11:39.192 --> 11:42.282
Probably got enough gas
in the truck to get you there.

11:42.326 --> 11:44.371
I was hoping
you would come.

11:44.415 --> 11:45.764
What we're doing,

11:45.808 --> 11:47.766
we could use somebody
with your skills.

11:47.810 --> 11:50.203
My skills?
What might those be?

11:50.247 --> 11:52.771
Plan is shifting because
we can't make a clean trade,

11:52.815 --> 11:55.078
but Virginia's still gonna want
her sister back.

11:56.688 --> 11:59.343
What, so you --
You want to use me as bait?

11:59.386 --> 12:01.388
Yeah.
But you don't worry.

12:01.432 --> 12:04.000
I'm not gonna let her
get to you.

12:05.001 --> 12:06.480
Hey.

12:11.442 --> 12:13.792
Do it like this,
it means a fight.

12:13.836 --> 12:15.011
That's why you need me.

12:15.054 --> 12:17.143
Well, things will be
different, though.

12:17.187 --> 12:18.449
We're gonna be set up
to win.

12:18.492 --> 12:19.972
We'll be fighting
on our own turf

12:20.016 --> 12:21.539
and on our own terms.

12:23.628 --> 12:25.499
God, John,
it's for our family.

12:25.543 --> 12:27.240
What's this?

12:29.242 --> 12:31.592
Nothing.

12:32.811 --> 12:34.639
Looks like blood.

12:34.682 --> 12:37.207
It's off
a knife handle.

12:37.250 --> 12:39.600
What knife?

12:39.644 --> 12:42.516
The one
that killed Cameron.

12:42.560 --> 12:44.431
The ranger?

12:44.475 --> 12:46.216
The one
that Janis was with?

12:46.259 --> 12:48.392
I thought
if I could find the rest of it,

12:48.435 --> 12:50.786
it would lead me
to whoever killed him.

12:50.829 --> 12:52.439
I couldn't.

12:52.483 --> 12:54.615
Why do you
still have it, then?

12:57.401 --> 12:58.968
You're doing it again.

12:59.011 --> 13:00.578
What?

13:00.621 --> 13:01.927
What you told me about before,
when you were a cop,

13:01.971 --> 13:05.452
how you hid yourself away
from the world up here.

13:05.496 --> 13:07.324
Well,
it's different this time.

13:07.367 --> 13:08.673
Why's that?

13:08.716 --> 13:10.283
Morgan? You there?

13:10.327 --> 13:12.459
We got something
we need to discuss.

13:12.503 --> 13:14.853
Don't. Don't.
Rangers are nearby.

13:14.897 --> 13:16.420
They might figure out
where we are.

13:16.463 --> 13:17.943
John's right.
Don't.

13:17.987 --> 13:19.466
She's just
trying to scare you.

13:19.510 --> 13:21.033
Morgan? It's me.

13:21.077 --> 13:22.208
Aw, hell.

13:22.252 --> 13:23.427
Sorry, I have to.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.908
Morgan!

13:28.258 --> 13:29.868
Yes, I'm here.

13:29.912 --> 13:33.785
I thought
that might do the trick.

13:33.829 --> 13:35.482
Grace,
are you okay?

13:35.526 --> 13:36.875
Is the baby okay?

13:36.919 --> 13:39.051
I'm okay, Morgan.

13:39.095 --> 13:41.097
So is the baby.

13:41.140 --> 13:43.969
I think this little one's
about seven months now.

13:44.013 --> 13:47.190
I thought
you were dead, Morgan.

13:47.233 --> 13:49.714
We all did.

13:49.757 --> 13:51.063
Hey.

13:51.107 --> 13:53.109
You hear that,
Morgan?

13:53.152 --> 13:55.676
Grace is fine,
but that'll change real quick

13:55.720 --> 13:57.243
if anything happens
to my sister.

13:57.287 --> 13:58.854
Call the rangers off.

13:58.897 --> 14:00.725
They're gonna get
everybody killed,

14:00.768 --> 14:01.944
including your sister.

14:03.728 --> 14:05.904
Oh, my rangers
will find you.

14:05.948 --> 14:09.560
In the meantime, I know
you'll keep my sister safe

14:09.603 --> 14:11.127
'cause if anything
happens to her,

14:11.170 --> 14:14.739
it's not just Grace and
her little chick who are dead.

14:14.782 --> 14:18.047
It's the whole
damn coop.

14:22.529 --> 14:25.054
We'll talk soon.

14:29.145 --> 14:31.147
We need
to get out of here now.

14:31.190 --> 14:33.540
We need
to draw Virginia to us

14:33.584 --> 14:36.239
before she does something
to them.

14:36.282 --> 14:38.458
Last time you locked yourself
away up here,

14:38.502 --> 14:39.720
June washed up.

14:39.764 --> 14:41.157
Today,
it was us.

14:41.200 --> 14:43.072
If that's not the universe
telling you to come back,

14:43.115 --> 14:44.464
I don't know
what is.

14:44.508 --> 14:45.857
Yeah.

14:45.901 --> 14:48.555
I just...

14:48.599 --> 14:51.776
I don't care
to kill anyone.

14:51.819 --> 14:55.127
Yeah, you called me a ghost,
and I am.

14:55.171 --> 14:58.783
'Cause all I'm here for
is to free our people,

14:58.826 --> 15:02.134
give that baby a chance
at a next world,

15:02.178 --> 15:04.310
one where,
I don't know,

15:04.354 --> 15:06.530
all life might actually
be precious.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.401
I think we can do
it, John.

15:08.445 --> 15:11.578
I think it's not gonna be
the way that we want it,

15:11.622 --> 15:12.971
but we can end it.

15:13.015 --> 15:15.495
Alright.

15:17.584 --> 15:20.152
I-I ain't right.

15:20.196 --> 15:22.894
I just ain't.

15:22.938 --> 15:24.330
I'm sorry.

15:24.374 --> 15:26.289
I can't do it.

15:28.030 --> 15:31.381
But I will help you
cross that bridge.

15:31.424 --> 15:33.818
It's the only
way north.

15:33.861 --> 15:35.472
We gotta pack up.

15:45.395 --> 15:47.005
This is all I got.

15:47.049 --> 15:49.747
Is that gonna be enough
to kill all the chompers?

15:49.790 --> 15:51.792
Your guess
is as good as mine.

15:51.836 --> 15:54.360
But there's only one way
to find out.

15:57.059 --> 15:59.017
Down!

16:06.372 --> 16:08.505
Morgan!
I'll pull him down!

16:13.640 --> 16:16.382
Dakota!
You know how to drive?

16:16.426 --> 16:18.950
Turn this thing around.

16:20.604 --> 16:23.520
Ah!

16:26.218 --> 16:27.654
Something's wrong
with the car.

16:27.698 --> 16:29.439
I think the bullet
may have hit the engine.

16:29.482 --> 16:31.049
Try again!

16:51.678 --> 16:54.768
Morgan?

16:54.812 --> 16:56.857
Geez.

16:56.901 --> 16:58.163
Morgan?

16:58.207 --> 17:00.078
You alright?

17:00.122 --> 17:02.341
Yeah.

17:35.113 --> 17:37.202
Sorry, John.

17:37.246 --> 17:38.508
Sorry?

17:38.551 --> 17:40.423
What do you got
to be sorry for?

17:40.466 --> 17:43.339
You're the one got dragged
through the woods by your neck.

17:43.382 --> 17:46.864
Yeah, I've been racking up
a whole lot of miles lately.

17:46.907 --> 17:48.257
You almost got killed.

17:48.300 --> 17:49.910
I didn't, though,
'cause you stopped him.

17:49.954 --> 17:51.869
Well, it shouldn't have
come to that.

17:51.912 --> 17:54.480
I should have taken my shot
when I had it back at Bill's.

17:54.524 --> 17:56.917
You didn't take it
'cause you didn't have to.

17:58.005 --> 18:00.138
You know
that's why I need you, right?

18:00.182 --> 18:01.748
Help keep us
from becoming like Ginny.

18:01.792 --> 18:02.967
You know that,
right?

18:03.010 --> 18:05.012
That's not
the only reason.

18:06.188 --> 18:09.452
Got all the gas out.

18:09.495 --> 18:12.672
That's about
all it's good for now.

18:12.716 --> 18:14.544
We're gonna need
another car.

18:14.587 --> 18:17.329
We could get back in a canoe,
head upstream,

18:17.373 --> 18:19.505
find another vehicle
back by Bill's.

18:19.549 --> 18:21.377
I can't risk it,

18:21.420 --> 18:23.379
not with all those rangers
out there looking for us.

18:23.422 --> 18:26.469
And there might be more
once he doesn't check in.

18:26.512 --> 18:28.949
Right.

18:33.432 --> 18:35.130
What about that one?

18:36.392 --> 18:37.741
That?

18:37.784 --> 18:40.004
That's just been collecting rust
since I was a kid.

18:50.580 --> 18:52.625
Where'd this come from?

18:52.669 --> 18:54.540
Well,
it belonged to my dad.

18:54.584 --> 18:57.891
We were gonna fix it up together
once upon a while.

18:57.935 --> 18:59.328
Hmm.

18:59.371 --> 19:00.981
You know, I've spent
more than my fair share of time

19:01.025 --> 19:02.766
in one garage
or another

19:02.809 --> 19:05.856
making cars in much worse shape
than this run again.

19:05.899 --> 19:09.642
We're gonna need a battery
and a distributor cap,

19:09.686 --> 19:12.515
but I think
I can get this going.

19:13.646 --> 19:15.605
It's not too late.

19:15.648 --> 19:17.041
What's that?

19:17.084 --> 19:21.219
Ah, just something
my daddy used to say.

19:21.263 --> 19:26.224
It's not to late
to learn something,

19:26.268 --> 19:29.749
to do the right thing,
fix a mistake,

19:29.793 --> 19:33.188
and apparently, get an old
Chevy truck running again.

19:34.276 --> 19:38.236
Well, there's some wrecked cars
one cabin over.

19:38.280 --> 19:41.587
Lot less likely of running
into rangers over there.

19:41.631 --> 19:42.849
You should go
with John.

19:42.893 --> 19:44.416
No,
I can handle it.

19:44.460 --> 19:46.897
Any other rangers show up,
I'm not sure that I can.

19:46.940 --> 19:48.377
They get ahold
of Dakota,

19:48.420 --> 19:50.901
everybody else is gonna be
in real trouble.

19:50.944 --> 19:55.384
Alright, well,
let's go.

19:58.604 --> 20:01.346
You get those guns
when you were a cop?

20:01.390 --> 20:04.219
No, they belonged
to my pop.

20:06.308 --> 20:09.224
And he gave you
the guns?

20:09.267 --> 20:13.837
Well, he sent them to me
that same summer

20:13.880 --> 20:19.408
we were supposed to
fix up the Chevy.

20:21.061 --> 20:23.281
Why didn't he
bring them to you?

20:23.325 --> 20:27.590
Well,
he never showed up.

20:27.633 --> 20:33.291
Moved to a cabin on his own
up north,

20:33.335 --> 20:36.425
away from everybody.

20:36.468 --> 20:40.211
Me and my mama included.

20:42.344 --> 20:46.435
I got the occasional
birthday or Christmas card.

20:48.175 --> 20:50.395
A phone call
every once in a blue moon.

20:50.439 --> 20:53.746
But I never
saw him again.

20:56.836 --> 20:58.055
Ah.

20:58.098 --> 21:00.057
Here, hold that.

21:00.100 --> 21:01.798
Yeah.

21:01.841 --> 21:04.757
Thank you.

21:04.801 --> 21:07.194
Why did he leave?

21:07.238 --> 21:10.502
Did he kill someone,
just like you did?

21:10.546 --> 21:12.722
No.

21:12.765 --> 21:15.072
What was it,
then?

21:16.160 --> 21:19.076
Well,
he did the wrong thing,

21:19.119 --> 21:21.470
but for
the right reasons.

21:22.993 --> 21:25.604
If that makes sense.

21:27.258 --> 21:30.957
Kind of seems like
he was punishing himself.

21:31.001 --> 21:34.309
Yeah, maybe.

21:34.352 --> 21:36.485
Just like you.

21:36.528 --> 21:39.923
Morgan was right,
isn't he?

21:39.966 --> 21:42.360
That's why you're here.

21:43.579 --> 21:44.971
Come on.

21:45.015 --> 21:46.669
There's one more thing
we got to get while we're here.

21:46.712 --> 21:50.281
Know-it-all.

21:51.587 --> 21:53.589
Hey, you know what happened
with Janis?

21:53.632 --> 21:55.982
You don't have to feel bad
about that kind of thing.

21:56.026 --> 21:58.202
It's -- It's just
how life is now.

21:58.245 --> 22:00.813
People -- People kill,
people die.

22:00.857 --> 22:03.338
It still
should mean something.

22:03.381 --> 22:05.252
Why?

22:06.341 --> 22:08.560
Well, if it don't mean nothing
when you die,

22:08.604 --> 22:11.171
then it must not have meant much
when you were alive, either.

22:11.215 --> 22:12.390
So?

22:12.434 --> 22:16.176
Boy, I'm glad
Morgan's taking you

22:16.220 --> 22:18.570
to that place
he's building.
Why's that?

22:18.614 --> 22:20.790
'Cause you're starting to sound
an awful lot like your sister.

22:20.833 --> 22:22.095
Now stand back.

22:22.139 --> 22:23.358
Hey!

22:24.924 --> 22:28.188
Anybody home?

22:35.065 --> 22:36.806
Alright.

22:37.894 --> 22:40.200
There's nothing in there
that we need for the truck.

22:41.288 --> 22:42.551
Who said we're here
for the truck?

22:44.291 --> 22:46.990
What do you need a door for
if you're coming with us?

22:47.033 --> 22:49.427
'Cause he's not
coming with us.

22:49.471 --> 22:53.257
-Are you, John?
-What you doing here?

22:54.476 --> 22:57.000
I found these.

22:59.611 --> 23:02.440
There's only so many words
you can spell out with those.

23:02.484 --> 23:05.965
These are not meantfor you.
I know
who they're meant for.

23:08.098 --> 23:11.536
Look,
I was gonna tell you

23:11.580 --> 23:13.233
after we cleared
the bridge.

23:13.277 --> 23:15.453
I'll keep my word.
I'll get you across.

23:15.497 --> 23:17.368
But then
I'm coming back here after.

23:17.412 --> 23:19.457
'Cause of what you had to do
to Marcus?

23:19.501 --> 23:22.112
No, not 'cause
I had to kill him.

23:22.155 --> 23:24.984
It's because
I didn't kill him before.

23:25.028 --> 23:26.986
Damn it!

23:28.988 --> 23:32.252
I don't know why...

23:32.296 --> 23:35.995
I'm not meant
to live in this world.

23:36.039 --> 23:38.302
If I'd have just
kept my nose out of it

23:38.345 --> 23:39.782
when Cameron was killed,

23:39.825 --> 23:41.479
Janis would still
be alive.

23:41.523 --> 23:44.264
If I'd have shot Marcus
when I had the chance,

23:44.308 --> 23:45.701
you wouldn't have
nearly died.

23:45.744 --> 23:47.485
Hiding away in that cabin
ain't the answer.

23:47.529 --> 23:49.661
Best one
I can think of.

23:50.836 --> 23:52.272
You went
looking for a door

23:52.316 --> 23:53.491
to shut yourself away
from the world,

23:53.535 --> 23:54.666
and you found us.

23:54.710 --> 23:56.886
Does that not
tell you anything?

23:56.929 --> 23:58.235
You're like that guy

23:58.278 --> 23:59.584
who walked
halfway across the country

23:59.628 --> 24:01.499
to get away from
the people he cares about most

24:01.543 --> 24:04.110
and found himself sitting across
from your campfire.

24:04.154 --> 24:06.635
And because
I found you,

24:06.678 --> 24:10.465
I found everybody
I think of as family right now.

24:10.508 --> 24:11.683
I found Grace.

24:11.727 --> 24:13.119
And that
wouldn't have happened

24:13.163 --> 24:14.686
if you hadn't insisted

24:14.730 --> 24:16.427
that I sleep in the bed
of your truck that night.

24:16.471 --> 24:18.298
You gave me
that family, man.

24:18.342 --> 24:21.519
You gotta help me
get them back.

24:22.955 --> 24:26.306
The best way I can think of
to do that

24:26.350 --> 24:28.831
is get you
across that bridge

24:28.874 --> 24:31.398
and then
stay out your way.

24:31.442 --> 24:33.357
That door
is not gonna keep us away.

24:33.400 --> 24:35.315
Not me, not June.

24:35.359 --> 24:37.666
This door
ain't for keeping people out.

24:37.709 --> 24:39.624
What the hell's it for,
then?

24:39.668 --> 24:42.279
It's to keep the passed
from getting at me

24:42.322 --> 24:44.324
after I do
what I need to do.

24:46.588 --> 24:49.504
I just want it to be over,
Morgan.

25:17.532 --> 25:19.272
Got the truck running.

25:19.316 --> 25:20.926
That's good.

25:30.632 --> 25:32.764
Wasn't that long ago
I was in something like

25:32.808 --> 25:34.331
the place
that you are now, John.

25:39.641 --> 25:42.818
Uh, every time
I work myself up to it,

25:42.861 --> 25:45.168
one of the passed
washes up,

25:45.211 --> 25:46.604
steals my nerve.

25:46.648 --> 25:49.607
That's 'cause
it's not your time.

25:49.651 --> 25:52.741
This is not
how you should go out.

25:52.784 --> 25:54.917
Here.

25:56.571 --> 25:59.051
Night at the Gulch...

26:01.488 --> 26:04.622
...whoever saved me,
they left me that.

26:04.666 --> 26:07.233
Made me realize
what I had to fight for.

26:07.277 --> 26:08.408
That place
you're building?

26:08.452 --> 26:10.802
Yeah, and that
it wouldn't mean anything

26:10.846 --> 26:12.369
if it wasn't
all of us.

26:12.412 --> 26:14.545
But if I was gonna
get everybody there,

26:14.589 --> 26:17.548
I had to...

26:20.812 --> 26:24.033
I had to
make a change.

26:24.076 --> 26:28.515
Or I would lose,
well, all of you.

26:29.647 --> 26:31.649
You know
you're not your dad, right?

26:31.693 --> 26:33.477
I know that.
And that
you don't have to

26:33.520 --> 26:35.392
make the same mistakes
that he made,

26:35.435 --> 26:39.004
that you can
come with us.

26:39.048 --> 26:41.441
I found my way
to keep going.

26:41.485 --> 26:44.270
I think
maybe you could find yours.

26:44.314 --> 26:45.837
Well...

26:47.622 --> 26:49.667
Wouldn't count on it.

26:51.234 --> 26:53.671
We better get up there.

26:53.715 --> 26:55.978
The passed must be building up
on the bridge.

27:00.330 --> 27:03.333
You know, we might need
these doors after all.

27:15.737 --> 27:16.868
Alright.

27:16.912 --> 27:18.522
We'll clear the passed
from up there.

27:18.565 --> 27:20.872
Keep them from getting tangled
in the wheels.

27:20.916 --> 27:22.874
Provided you can
get us across.

27:24.397 --> 27:26.008
Uh, my daddy used to let me
drive his six speed

27:26.051 --> 27:28.880
in the church parking lot
on Sunday afternoons, so I...

27:28.924 --> 27:31.535
It didn't usually get
this crowded.

27:31.578 --> 27:34.146
Okay.
Well, I'll talk you through it.

27:34.190 --> 27:36.496
Here.
In case things get bumpy.

28:00.782 --> 28:03.045
Ready?

28:03.088 --> 28:05.700
Ready.

28:12.141 --> 28:13.751
Come up.

28:18.364 --> 28:20.323
Now!

28:29.288 --> 28:30.812
That's it.

28:34.424 --> 28:36.034
Steady, steady, steady.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.872
Here they come!

29:00.667 --> 29:02.495
Keep going!

29:17.206 --> 29:19.208
Second gear!

29:20.339 --> 29:22.037
Alright. I'm sorry.

29:22.080 --> 29:25.780
Just pretend it's one of those
Sunday drives, okay?

29:25.823 --> 29:28.217
You got it.

29:32.177 --> 29:34.179
You okay?
Yeah.

29:34.223 --> 29:36.791
Yeah, I'm fine.

29:42.927 --> 29:45.234
Hey.

29:45.277 --> 29:47.236
Hey, guys, what's going on?

29:54.069 --> 29:56.419
Alright.
Put it in first.

29:56.462 --> 29:58.203
Then give it the gas.

29:58.247 --> 30:00.553
You'll clear it.

30:25.230 --> 30:26.666
Punch it.

30:38.722 --> 30:41.507
Something's wrong
with the engine!

30:41.551 --> 30:43.901
The alternator.

30:43.945 --> 30:45.120
I'll go.

30:45.163 --> 30:47.209
No,
you're in no shape.

30:47.252 --> 30:48.688
You're in no shape.

31:01.963 --> 31:03.921
I'll tell you when.

31:19.284 --> 31:20.938
No! Get off!

31:25.334 --> 31:26.944
John!

31:26.988 --> 31:28.467
Lean back!

31:35.561 --> 31:37.215
Nice shot!

31:42.351 --> 31:45.745
Okay.

31:45.789 --> 31:47.312
Try now.

32:04.808 --> 32:06.244
Get down!

32:12.598 --> 32:14.513
John, hold on!

32:48.243 --> 32:50.636
God, John.

32:50.680 --> 32:53.465
That is
some ugly mustard.

32:53.509 --> 32:55.380
Ha!

32:55.424 --> 32:59.036
Yes, it is.

33:12.832 --> 33:15.879
I found something
when I was working on the truck.

33:15.922 --> 33:17.185
Thought you might
want it.

33:19.274 --> 33:21.363
That's you,
isn't it?

33:21.406 --> 33:22.755
And your dad?

33:22.799 --> 33:25.193
You know...

33:29.414 --> 33:34.071
I spent more of my life
than I care to admit

33:34.115 --> 33:38.902
wondering why he never showed up
that summer.

33:38.945 --> 33:42.732
Now I think
I'm starting to get it.

33:44.951 --> 33:47.215
I ain't
coming with you, Morgan.

33:47.258 --> 33:48.868
You know you're stuck.

33:48.912 --> 33:51.088
Making the same mistakes
you made before,

33:51.132 --> 33:52.916
and they're the same mistakes
that he made.

33:52.959 --> 33:56.485
Man, it's like --
It's like a loop.

33:59.096 --> 34:00.750
What you doing?

34:00.793 --> 34:03.970
Virginia,
can you hear me?

34:04.014 --> 34:05.842
I repeat, Virginia,
can you hear me?

34:05.885 --> 34:07.104
What's your plan,
Morgan?

34:07.148 --> 34:08.714
I copy, Morgan.

34:08.758 --> 34:10.107
You finally ready
to talk?

34:10.151 --> 34:12.283
Yeah, yeah, I am,
but not like this.

34:12.327 --> 34:13.980
I want
to meet in person.

34:17.549 --> 34:21.553
So, there's a general store off
-of old route 185.
-No! No! Morgan!

34:21.597 --> 34:22.815
It's called Bill's.
Stop!

34:22.859 --> 34:24.121
And a couple miles
down river --

34:24.165 --> 34:26.906
Get off of me --
there is a cabin.

34:26.950 --> 34:29.083
Lemme guess.
Ranger Dorie's?

34:29.126 --> 34:31.911
Yeah, Marcus told us about
his terrible taste in movies.

34:33.478 --> 34:36.481
I'll be waiting there
for you.

34:36.525 --> 34:39.093
We'll see you soon,
Morgan.

34:42.008 --> 34:44.446
Now you can't go back.

34:44.489 --> 34:46.926
Morgan,
you had no right!

34:46.970 --> 34:49.146
That was not
your choice to make!

34:49.190 --> 34:50.756
Just like
it wasn't yours

34:50.800 --> 34:52.454
to chase me down that road
when I had my busted leg,

34:52.497 --> 34:55.152
but you did it
all the same.

34:55.196 --> 34:58.199
And I'm alive right now
because you did.

35:01.202 --> 35:03.508
Shit, John,
hate me if you like,

35:03.552 --> 35:06.163
but I'll be damned
if I'm gonna stand by

35:06.207 --> 35:09.427
and let my best friend try
and kill himself.

35:27.837 --> 35:30.796
I'm gonna try
and get a signal,

35:30.840 --> 35:33.321
hear where
Virginia's at.

35:34.844 --> 35:38.543
Don't wanna cross paths with her
on the way outta here.

35:42.417 --> 35:46.116
You're gonna have to
talk to him eventually.

35:47.857 --> 35:49.206
Well,
looks like the clip

35:49.250 --> 35:51.382
that was holding
the wire in place fell off.

35:51.426 --> 35:52.818
Probably why
she stalled.

35:52.862 --> 35:54.820
We'll have to make sure
she's fixed up

35:54.864 --> 35:56.561
before you two
hit the road.

35:56.605 --> 35:58.084
It's a little red clip.

35:58.128 --> 36:01.349
I'll take this side.
You take that side.

36:12.534 --> 36:14.797
Hey.

36:14.840 --> 36:16.625
Thanks.

36:16.668 --> 36:17.800
Nah,
thank you.

36:17.843 --> 36:19.758
What are you
thanking me for?

36:19.802 --> 36:22.761
Well,
letting me drive.

36:22.805 --> 36:25.416
Trusting me with this.

36:25.460 --> 36:27.244
Not making me
feel like

36:27.288 --> 36:31.379
I had to be locked behind
Lawton's walls all the time.

36:33.685 --> 36:36.035
You should come
with us.

36:36.079 --> 36:38.908
No, that wouldn't be
a good idea.

36:38.951 --> 36:41.258
I think
it <i>would</i> be a good idea.

36:41.302 --> 36:44.043
I really like
being around you.

36:44.087 --> 36:45.871
Well...

36:45.915 --> 36:47.960
You can't go back
to your cabin.

36:48.004 --> 36:49.179
Sure, I can.

36:49.223 --> 36:51.877
Well, my sister's
gonna be there soon.

36:51.921 --> 36:56.012
If Morgan leads her to whatever
place he's building up,

36:56.055 --> 36:59.276
that's gonna get real messy
real quick.

37:00.538 --> 37:03.106
People we care about
could end up dead.

37:03.149 --> 37:06.283
If I'm waiting for her,
I can end this.

37:06.327 --> 37:08.024
You can't
do that alone.

37:08.067 --> 37:09.678
She won't
be expecting me.

37:09.721 --> 37:11.680
Well,
she would.

37:11.723 --> 37:13.072
She is.

37:13.116 --> 37:15.858
I mean, she's gonna have rangers
with her.

37:15.901 --> 37:18.469
So what,
even if you get her,

37:18.513 --> 37:20.297
then they're just
gonna kill you.

37:20.341 --> 37:23.300
Well, then my death
will mean something.

37:24.649 --> 37:27.086
As it should.

37:30.264 --> 37:31.482
Hey, John.

37:31.526 --> 37:33.267
I found it.

37:35.704 --> 37:38.097
Dakota!

37:41.666 --> 37:42.928
It's okay.

37:42.972 --> 37:44.321
I got it.

37:45.844 --> 37:48.325
What is it?
I got it.

37:48.369 --> 37:50.371
What are you hiding?

37:56.290 --> 37:58.379
Where'd you get this?

38:00.555 --> 38:01.947
-Where'd you get this?!
-It's not what it looks like,
okay?

38:01.991 --> 38:03.340
I just --
I-I-I found it.

38:03.384 --> 38:05.299
Don't you lie to me!

38:09.346 --> 38:11.696
Oh, my God.

38:11.740 --> 38:14.351
You killed Cameron,
didn't you?

38:14.395 --> 38:18.094
Virginia was covering
for you.

38:19.748 --> 38:21.140
I didn't know

38:21.184 --> 38:22.664
that she was
gonna kill Janis.

38:25.188 --> 38:27.321
Why'd you push me
to investigate?

38:27.364 --> 38:30.149
I knew that Ginny
wouldn't let it get back to me.

38:30.193 --> 38:32.151
And I thought
if it seemed like --

38:32.195 --> 38:33.936
if it seemed like
she was hiding something

38:33.979 --> 38:35.372
or trying
to protect somebody,

38:35.416 --> 38:38.332
that, you know,
people would start to doubt her.

38:38.375 --> 38:40.159
What did you
kill him for?

38:42.031 --> 38:43.902
What did you
-kill him for?!
-He figured out

38:43.946 --> 38:46.557
the way that I was sneaking in
and out of Lawton,

38:46.601 --> 38:47.906
and he told Ginny.

38:47.950 --> 38:50.692
He took away
the one way that I had

38:50.735 --> 38:52.389
to get out of Lawton.

38:52.433 --> 38:55.000
And you thought he deserved
to die for that?

38:55.044 --> 38:56.524
That's what you thought?

38:58.047 --> 38:59.527
It's no different.

38:59.570 --> 39:02.530
It's no different
than what everyone else is doing

39:02.573 --> 39:04.314
to get
what they want!

39:04.358 --> 39:06.403
It's what
my sister does.

39:06.447 --> 39:08.797
It's what
all of her rangers do.

39:08.840 --> 39:10.799
You don't understand.

39:10.842 --> 39:12.844
No.
No, I don't.

39:12.888 --> 39:15.630
You don't understand.
It's just how things are now.

39:15.673 --> 39:21.200
I can't.

39:21.244 --> 39:23.768
I can't let you
ruin this for me.

39:23.812 --> 39:25.422
Alright.
Listen to me.

39:25.466 --> 39:27.642
-I can't have youtelling people.
-Listen to me, Dakota.

39:27.685 --> 39:29.557
I am -- I'm not
gonna tell anyone.

39:29.600 --> 39:31.080
Alright, look.

39:31.123 --> 39:33.430
Lookit -- Look here.
Alright?

39:33.474 --> 39:36.172
I'm not
gonna hurt you.

39:36.215 --> 39:38.435
Look.

39:38.479 --> 39:39.741
Okay?

39:41.395 --> 39:42.570
You're lying.

39:44.049 --> 39:46.617
I know
you've been through a lot.

39:46.661 --> 39:50.012
I get why
you wouldn't believe me.

39:50.055 --> 39:53.189
Just give me a chance
to show you.

39:53.232 --> 39:54.538
Why?

39:54.582 --> 39:56.018
Because we can
get past this.

39:56.061 --> 39:57.367
I can help you.

39:57.411 --> 40:00.762
Morgan said I need
a reason to live.

40:00.805 --> 40:01.850
To keep going.

40:01.893 --> 40:03.547
Maybe that's you.

40:03.591 --> 40:05.157
That would have meaning.
Right?

40:05.201 --> 40:07.421
So just
put the gun down.

40:07.464 --> 40:10.032
You don't want to shoot
me. You don't want to
do that to yourself.

40:10.075 --> 40:11.642
You -- You don't want to live
with that.

40:11.686 --> 40:12.817
That's not what I want.

40:27.702 --> 40:29.834
I'm sorry.

40:34.535 --> 40:37.451
It doesn't always have to
mean something, John.

Dakota?

43:10.212 --> 43:11.779
Hey.

43:13.476 --> 43:16.000
What did you do?

43:18.089 --> 43:22.137
I didn't want to do it.

43:22.180 --> 43:24.661
But I had to do it.

43:24.705 --> 43:26.837
John.

43:28.796 --> 43:30.798
Where is he?

43:33.496 --> 43:35.280
Floating down river,

43:35.324 --> 43:38.414
with a bullet
in his chest.

43:47.336 --> 43:49.860
It was your knife.

43:49.904 --> 43:52.689
You killed
that ranger.

44:02.481 --> 44:04.875
You're gonna take me
to the place you're building.

44:04.919 --> 44:09.750
You're gonna let me be a part of
it like you were before.

44:15.581 --> 44:18.280
You're not
gonna hurt me.

44:18.323 --> 44:19.803
I wouldn't be
so sure.

44:19.847 --> 44:22.327
I am the reason
you are alive!

44:22.371 --> 44:25.330
I saved you
at the Gulch.

44:25.374 --> 44:27.637
That is not
what happened.
It is.

44:27.681 --> 44:30.727
Ginny --
she left you to die.

44:30.771 --> 44:34.426
Dragged yourself
up to the church.

44:34.470 --> 44:37.038
The dead
followed you.

44:37.081 --> 44:40.694
They were on top of you,
about to eat you.

44:40.737 --> 44:42.652
But I was there.

44:42.696 --> 44:44.306
I killed them.

44:44.349 --> 44:45.873
That's not possible.

44:45.916 --> 44:47.526
It is.

44:47.570 --> 44:52.575
I followed Ginny
and the rangers to the Gulch

44:52.618 --> 44:55.752
'cause I wanted to see her
go down.

44:55.796 --> 44:56.971
And, I mean, even though
that didn't happen,

44:57.014 --> 44:59.321
I mean,
it's a good thing, right?

44:59.364 --> 45:02.541
'Cause I stitched you up,
stopped you from bleeding.

45:02.585 --> 45:04.152
I gave you antibiotics.

45:04.195 --> 45:05.544
I gave you painkillers.

45:05.588 --> 45:07.590
I-I left you
food and supplies.

45:07.633 --> 45:09.548
Okay, stop.
No more lies.

45:09.592 --> 45:11.420
No,
you don't know me!

45:11.463 --> 45:14.205
But I've heard
your message.

45:14.249 --> 45:16.555
You need
to do the same.

45:16.599 --> 45:19.515
"You still have things
left to do."

45:22.039 --> 45:23.171
I wrote it.

45:23.214 --> 45:25.129
I wrote that note.

45:25.173 --> 45:27.218
I left it for you.

45:27.262 --> 45:28.872
And I was right to

45:28.916 --> 45:32.615
because that thing
that you have to do,

45:32.658 --> 45:35.139
you're gonna
have to do it now.

45:35.183 --> 45:37.098
And what is that?

45:42.190 --> 45:44.758
Kill my sister.

45:47.064 --> 45:50.415
You're not breathing
because you have

45:50.459 --> 45:54.028
some silly, little paradise
that you have to build.

45:54.071 --> 45:55.638
You are breathing

45:55.681 --> 46:00.208
because you are the only
person left that can end her!

46:00.251 --> 46:01.687
Hey.

46:01.731 --> 46:03.951
That's not
what this is about.

46:03.994 --> 46:07.345
It is.

46:07.389 --> 46:14.222
And it is the only reason
that you are still here!

46:29.498 --> 46:32.457
Someone cleaned
the place out.

46:32.501 --> 46:35.504
Where the hell
are they?

46:37.071 --> 46:38.507
June,
where are they?

46:38.550 --> 46:39.943
I don't know.
I don't know!

46:39.987 --> 46:41.466
You sure about that?

46:41.510 --> 46:44.208
I am sick
Virginia?

46:45.514 --> 46:47.037
Morgan,
you're late.

46:47.081 --> 46:48.386
It's John.

46:48.430 --> 46:49.823
He's been hurt.
You need to help him.

46:49.866 --> 46:51.476
It was your sister.
She did it to him.

46:51.520 --> 46:52.869
Morgan,
where is he?

46:54.088 --> 46:55.393
Where's my sister?

46:55.437 --> 46:57.482
He's heading your way.

46:57.526 --> 46:58.570
He's coming down river.

46:58.614 --> 46:59.876
I'm trying to get to him,

46:59.920 --> 47:02.574
but if I can't find him first,
please help him.

47:02.618 --> 47:03.837
Then we talk.

47:03.880 --> 47:06.535
You heard Morgan.
Go find Ranger Dorie.

47:15.109 --> 47:16.197
Well...

47:16.240 --> 47:18.242
This is it.

47:18.286 --> 47:20.723
Yeah, it's what we rebuilt
so far,

47:20.766 --> 47:23.857
but it's a start.

47:23.900 --> 47:26.076
Where's Morgan?

47:26.120 --> 47:27.730
We got separated.

47:27.773 --> 47:30.124
Al? Dwight? Do you copy?

47:32.343 --> 47:33.518
Go for Dwight.

47:33.562 --> 47:35.564
Start getting
the dam wall ready.

47:35.607 --> 47:37.827
We may end up bringing
this fight with Virginia

47:37.871 --> 47:39.568
to our own doorstep.

47:40.438 --> 47:41.918
Copy, Morgan.

47:41.962 --> 47:44.312
And, Dwight,
maybe reach out to Sherry.

47:44.355 --> 47:48.229
'Cause we're gonna need
all the firepower we can get.

47:53.799 --> 47:56.280
You need to send more rangers
to look for him.

47:56.324 --> 47:57.934
I already have.

47:57.978 --> 47:59.457
Radio Morgan.

47:59.501 --> 48:01.155
I need to know what happened
if I'm going to help.

48:01.198 --> 48:02.460
Damn it!

48:06.769 --> 48:08.249
Hill, what's going on
down there?

48:08.292 --> 48:10.468
What do you have?

48:14.342 --> 48:17.954
John!
