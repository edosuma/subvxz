00:02.134 --> 00:04.125
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:04.303 --> 00:07.534
For over a century,
I have lived in secret, until now.

00:07.773 --> 00:10.003
I know the risk, but I have to know her.

00:10.175 --> 00:11.369
What are you?

00:11.543 --> 00:14.011
- I'm a vampire.
- You said you don't kill to survive.

00:14.179 --> 00:15.544
Animal blood keeps me alive.

00:15.714 --> 00:17.978
- But not as strong as Damon.
- Hello, brother.

00:18.150 --> 00:20.311
- Damon.
- Stefan finally fessed up.

00:20.486 --> 00:21.851
Stay away from me.

00:22.021 --> 00:24.353
That necklace contains an herb
called vervain.

00:24.523 --> 00:27.686
- It protects you from being compelled.
- I will keep your secret.

00:27.860 --> 00:29.828
But I can't be with you, Stefan.

00:30.329 --> 00:32.593
- What is that?
- A very important crystal.

00:32.798 --> 00:36.165
- Are you psychic or clairvoyant?
- Technically, Grams says I'm a witch.

00:36.335 --> 00:40.567
There was a time when this town
was very much aware of vampires.

00:40.806 --> 00:43.274
- Five bodies all drained of blood?
- They've come back.

00:45.444 --> 00:47.071
You just don't wanna die, do you?

00:47.312 --> 00:48.540
She's transitioning.

00:48.747 --> 00:49.873
- Into what?
- A vampire.

00:50.082 --> 00:52.710
- I don't know what's wrong with her.
- She'll be fine.

00:53.419 --> 00:55.080
- We'll all be fine.
- Vicki.

00:55.320 --> 00:58.483
I'll make sure that she does not hurt
anybody, Elena. I promise you.

00:59.124 --> 01:00.989
- All right, later, man.
- See you, bro.

01:34.660 --> 01:37.254
- Hi, Ty.
- Whoa.

01:37.429 --> 01:39.090
Vicki?

01:40.165 --> 01:42.463
- Everyone's looking for you.
- I know.

01:43.268 --> 01:44.326
What's wrong, Vick?

01:44.503 --> 01:46.266
- I'm so cold.
- You on drugs?

01:46.472 --> 01:48.872
- Everyone thinks you're off on a bender.
- I wish.

01:49.074 --> 01:52.043
What happened in those woods?
Those kids that were killed.

01:52.211 --> 01:53.678
What did you see?

01:57.883 --> 02:01.284
- I'm so scared.
- Come here.

02:01.453 --> 02:02.715
It's okay. I'll take you home.

02:04.756 --> 02:06.883
- I can't control it.
- Control what?

02:07.092 --> 02:10.151
I am so hungry, Ty.

02:11.630 --> 02:13.097
And it won't go away.

02:13.298 --> 02:15.323
What are you on?
What drugs did you take?

02:16.435 --> 02:20.030
I want it. I'm so hungry, Ty.

02:20.205 --> 02:23.504
Okay, look, I'll get you something to eat.
Just sit back. Let's just get you home.

02:24.877 --> 02:26.674
Vicki. What is wrong with you?

02:26.912 --> 02:28.402
Vick. Unh.

02:29.982 --> 02:31.279
Vicki, no!

02:32.684 --> 02:35.414
Let go of me! Unh!

02:38.290 --> 02:40.121
What's going on? What's wrong with her?

02:40.292 --> 02:41.987
- You don't talk.
- Screw you, dude.

02:42.194 --> 02:44.958
- "Dude"? Really? "Dude"?
- Damon, don't.

02:45.130 --> 02:47.496
Oh, come on.
Who's gonna miss this idiot?

02:49.168 --> 02:50.635
Don't you hurt him.

02:53.038 --> 02:56.064
Forget what you saw here tonight.
None of us were here.

03:44.289 --> 03:46.917
- Sorry.
- Oh, no, it's cool. I'm done.

03:47.626 --> 03:49.423
You're up early. Where are you going?

03:49.595 --> 03:52.359
Police station. They're organizing
a search party for Vicki.

03:52.531 --> 03:56.433
- Wait. Shouldn't you be going to school?
- You're kidding me, right?

03:56.602 --> 03:57.864
You shouldn't skip school.

03:58.036 --> 04:01.028
If they find her, we'll know.
That's what cell phones are for.

04:01.206 --> 04:04.004
Yeah, your lips keep moving.
I don't know why.

04:20.625 --> 04:23.151
- Yeah
- Matty?

04:23.328 --> 04:24.989
Vicki, where are you? Are you okay?

04:25.163 --> 04:27.256
- I'm okay.
- Tell me where you are.

04:27.432 --> 04:29.263
- I'll come get you.
- No, Matty.

04:29.468 --> 04:31.663
I just need some time
to figure things out.

04:33.171 --> 04:35.605
Just know that I'm okay, okay?
Please don't worry about me.

04:42.281 --> 04:45.250
I don't understand why I have to stay.
Why can't I go home?

04:45.450 --> 04:49.250
Because you're changing, Vicki,
and it's not something you wanna do alone.

04:49.421 --> 04:53.949
There's nothing about that Logan guy
I killed in here. Not a word.

04:54.693 --> 04:57.321
- Someone's covering it up.
- What is that?

04:58.063 --> 04:59.997
This is a very special, very old compass.

05:00.165 --> 05:02.759
What was Logan Fell doing with it?
Aren't you curious?

05:02.934 --> 05:06.028
Well, if you're so worried
that somebody's onto you, leave town.

05:06.204 --> 05:07.603
We should all be worried.

05:07.773 --> 05:10.970
Hey, I'm hungry.
Do you have anything to eat?

05:14.846 --> 05:16.279
Here.

05:18.083 --> 05:20.142
- What is it?
- It's what you're craving.

05:20.319 --> 05:22.184
Heh. Don't lie to the girl.

05:22.354 --> 05:25.187
It's so not what you're craving,
but it'll do in a pinch.

05:25.390 --> 05:27.051
- What is it
- Yeah, what is it?

05:27.225 --> 05:29.693
Is it skunk? St. Bernard? Bambi?

05:29.895 --> 05:32.022
- Go on, give it a try.
- She's new.

05:32.197 --> 05:34.688
She needs people blood.
She can't sustain on that stuff.

05:34.866 --> 05:37.164
- Mm, yeah, why can't I have people blood?
- Yeah.

05:37.336 --> 05:40.134
Because it's wrong
to prey on innocent people, Vicki.

05:40.305 --> 05:42.967
You don't have to kill to feed.
Find someone tasty...

05:43.141 --> 05:45.006
...and then erase their memory.
It's so easy.

05:46.378 --> 05:48.903
There's no guarantee
that you can control yourself, okay?

05:49.114 --> 05:51.742
It takes years to learn that.
You could kill somebody.

05:51.917 --> 05:55.751
You have to carry that with you for
the rest of your life, which is eternity.

05:55.921 --> 06:00.551
Don't listen to him. He walks
on a moral plane way out of our eyeline.

06:00.726 --> 06:03.490
I say snatch, eat, erase.

06:03.695 --> 06:06.664
Hey, look at me.
We choose our own path.

06:06.832 --> 06:09.824
Our values and our actions,
they define who we are.

06:10.001 --> 06:12.731
Okay, Count Deepak.

06:15.073 --> 06:17.667
- I am out of here.
- Yum.

06:19.211 --> 06:20.872
Can I have some more?

06:40.232 --> 06:42.757
- Is Stefan here?
- Yep.

06:42.968 --> 06:44.026
Where is he?

06:44.202 --> 06:47.467
And good morning to you,
Little Miss I'm-on-a-Mission.

06:48.039 --> 06:52.066
How can you be so arrogant and glib
after everything that you've done?

06:52.277 --> 06:57.044
And how can you be so brave and stupid
to call a vampire arrogant and glib?

06:57.249 --> 06:59.774
- Lf you wanted me dead, I'd be dead.
- Yes, you would.

06:59.985 --> 07:01.953
- But I'm not.
- Yet.

07:03.789 --> 07:05.723
- Where is Stefan?
- He's upstairs.

07:06.391 --> 07:09.883
Singing "The Rain in Spain."
Knock yourself out.

07:22.841 --> 07:23.865
Stefan?

07:26.144 --> 07:28.704
- Stefan
- Yes?

07:31.416 --> 07:34.351
- Where is Vicki?
- She's upstairs.

07:37.956 --> 07:39.389
What happens now?

07:39.558 --> 07:42.152
My brother is searching for her
with the rest of the town.

07:42.327 --> 07:44.352
- What do I tell him?
- I'm working with her.

07:44.529 --> 07:47.965
It's gonna take time. She's
a very volatile and impulsive personality.

07:48.133 --> 07:51.762
She's a drug user. That's gonna play
a part in how she responds to this.

07:51.970 --> 07:54.029
So she's a vampire with issues?

07:54.806 --> 07:58.435
What am I supposed to do? Because I am
lying to everyone that I care about.

07:58.610 --> 08:01.272
- What's gonna happen to her?
- I'm gonna keep her here...

08:01.446 --> 08:05.109
...until I know that she's safe.
How long is that?

08:07.519 --> 08:10.352
- We can talk about that later.
- Hey.

08:10.822 --> 08:16.158
- Vicki. How are you?
- How am I? You're kidding, right?

08:22.300 --> 08:25.633
Was our family burned in the witch trials?

08:26.037 --> 08:31.134
No, the girls that were persecuted
in Salem were entirely innocent.

08:31.309 --> 08:34.142
You have to have more than ignorance
to trap a real witch.

08:34.312 --> 08:37.008
Well, how did we end up in Mystic Falls?

08:37.182 --> 08:42.142
Our family fled Salem in 1692
and relocated here.

08:42.320 --> 08:46.848
Our ancestors lived in secrecy
for over a hundred years.

08:47.025 --> 08:48.549
It's important that we still do.

08:48.793 --> 08:50.886
Grams, everybody knows you're a witch.

08:51.096 --> 08:54.429
They also know it's absurd. Can't be true.

08:54.599 --> 08:58.558
I'm just a kooky lady
that teaches occult at the university.

08:58.737 --> 09:01.035
No one really believes.

09:01.206 --> 09:02.730
They just poke fun.

09:02.908 --> 09:04.398
And let them.

09:04.576 --> 09:06.043
Don't let them know the truth.

09:07.546 --> 09:09.070
Where is the witchcraft?

09:09.247 --> 09:12.512
I mean, you've been talking history
for two days.

09:12.684 --> 09:16.347
- I wanna get to the fun part.
- It's not meant to be fun.

09:16.521 --> 09:18.580
It's real and it's serious.

09:18.823 --> 09:22.554
And you must understand it
before you practice it.

09:25.564 --> 09:27.828
Aren't you late for school?

09:36.541 --> 09:39.408
- Thanks for the update.
- Yes, sir.

09:46.785 --> 09:49.253
We never should've trusted that Logan...

09:49.421 --> 09:52.117
...weasel with the watch.
- How many are we dealing with?

09:52.290 --> 09:55.282
The coroner thinks one.
The wound radius and the jaw pattern...

09:55.460 --> 09:58.452
Are we in danger? If it found the watch,
then it knows we know.

09:58.630 --> 10:01.565
And could it come after us?
And should I even be saying "it"?

10:01.733 --> 10:04.725
- Is it a he or a she?
- Lf it has any historical knowledge of...

10:04.903 --> 10:09.169
...the town, it'll know where the watch
came from. Yes, we could be in danger.

10:09.374 --> 10:11.365
- So, what do we do?
- Just keep it quiet.

10:11.576 --> 10:13.635
We can't have the entire town
aware of this.

10:13.812 --> 10:16.781
We have to find it before it finds us.

10:26.491 --> 10:30.291
Hey, man. I heard they're
putting together a search party for Vicki.

10:30.462 --> 10:32.828
She just called. She's okay.

10:32.998 --> 10:36.331
Good. That's great. I figured you
must've been going out of your mind.

10:36.501 --> 10:37.798
Little bit, yeah.

10:37.969 --> 10:42.030
I was just gonna offer, you know,
if there's anything I could do.

10:42.207 --> 10:43.640
I appreciate it.

10:43.842 --> 10:46.811
I have got your costume. It's all here.

10:50.181 --> 10:52.342
- Seriously?
- Ahh, come on.

10:52.517 --> 10:55.145
Can someone please be excited
that it's Halloween?

10:55.320 --> 10:56.651
I just wanna have fun.

10:56.821 --> 11:02.020
You know, just some silly,
fluffy, Damon-free fun.

11:02.193 --> 11:05.959
- Isn't this the one you got from Damon?
- Yep. Wear it, toss it. I don't care.

11:06.131 --> 11:10.397
I want it gone. Have you seen Elena?
Do we know what she's wearing?

11:10.568 --> 11:14.834
I was with Grams all weekend. I haven't
talked to her. Maybe she's with Stefan.

11:15.006 --> 11:18.066
- Riding to his castle on his white horse?
- Oh, don't be bitter.

11:18.243 --> 11:20.473
- It provokes wrinkles.
- Heh.

11:22.847 --> 11:25.315
Coffee is our friend. It's the caffeine.

11:25.483 --> 11:28.077
It circulates through our veins
and warms our bodies...

11:28.253 --> 11:30.813
...so we're not so cold to the touch.

11:31.089 --> 11:33.250
Well, what if I wanna drink human blood?

11:33.458 --> 11:35.392
You have to learn to live with that urge.

11:35.560 --> 11:37.721
Fight it on a daily basis,
one day at a time.

11:37.896 --> 11:40.524
Oh, God. Don't start
with that whole 12 Steps thing.

11:40.699 --> 11:44.066
School counselor has been down that road.
It doesn't work for me.

11:44.235 --> 11:49.172
- It can work. It's your choice, Vicki.
- So you've never tasted human blood?

11:53.878 --> 11:55.903
- Not in a long time.
- How long?

11:57.082 --> 11:58.276
Years and years.

11:59.617 --> 12:02.347
I'm not proud of my past behavior.

12:03.755 --> 12:07.213
Does this sketchy feeling ever go away?
It's like I have a massive hangover.

12:07.425 --> 12:08.915
This daylight thing is a bitch.

12:09.127 --> 12:12.619
Ugh. I need more blood.
Where's your bathroom? I have to pee.

12:12.797 --> 12:15.493
Why do I have to pee?
I thought I was dead.

12:20.305 --> 12:21.567
I'm gonna, uh...

12:21.740 --> 12:23.230
I'm gonna get her some more.

12:24.609 --> 12:27.442
Right. I'll be quick.

12:40.058 --> 12:43.255
False alarm.
My body's feeling really funky.

12:43.428 --> 12:46.056
It's a good funk, but it's weird.

12:46.231 --> 12:47.357
Hmm.

12:48.733 --> 12:50.667
- Who are you calling?
- Jeremy.

12:50.902 --> 12:54.099
- Vicki, you can't see Jeremy anymore.
- Oh, come on.

12:54.272 --> 12:57.571
- I'm gonna see whoever I wanna see.
- Even though you could hurt him?

12:57.742 --> 13:00.609
- I would never hurt Jeremy.
- I know you think that.

13:00.779 --> 13:02.804
But I can't take that risk.

13:02.981 --> 13:05.472
- You're gonna have to let Jeremy go.
- Oh, really?

13:05.683 --> 13:09.119
And how long have you been preparing
the you're-not-good-enough speech?

13:09.287 --> 13:11.255
I assume it predates the vampire thing.

13:11.422 --> 13:15.916
All I'm saying is Jeremy
is not getting involved in any of this.

13:16.127 --> 13:19.187
- I mean it, Vicki.
- Or what?

13:22.200 --> 13:25.465
Let's get one thing straight,
you perky little bitch.

13:25.670 --> 13:27.695
You had my brother whipped
for 15 years.

13:27.872 --> 13:30.363
Fifteen years. And then you dumped him.

13:30.575 --> 13:35.103
When I look at you, that is all I see.
Just so you know.

13:35.280 --> 13:37.805
And I'm gonna see Jeremy
whenever I wanna see Jeremy.

13:37.982 --> 13:40.644
I have some fun new toys to play with...

13:40.819 --> 13:45.153
...and I won't think twice
about ripping your little head off.

13:45.323 --> 13:46.517
You got it?

13:58.636 --> 14:00.831
- She threatened me.
- She's on edge.

14:01.005 --> 14:04.031
Imagine every sense in your body
operating at super-speed.

14:04.209 --> 14:06.302
I mean, she's uncomfortable
in her own skin.

14:06.477 --> 14:09.640
- When you throw in her other issues...
- How long before it settles?

14:09.814 --> 14:12.146
- Hours? Days? Weeks?
- There's no rulebook.

14:12.317 --> 14:14.512
Well, how long
before you learned to control it?

14:14.686 --> 14:18.122
A while. I didn't have anybody
helping me. I had to do it on my own.

14:18.323 --> 14:22.316
The thing is, it's hard to resist certain
people, especially when you're new.

14:22.493 --> 14:26.429
Love, lust, anger, desire.

14:26.631 --> 14:31.330
- Hunger.
- What does that mean?

14:31.536 --> 14:34.767
It means Jeremy can't see her.
She might not be able to resist him.

14:34.939 --> 14:38.238
- And she could hurt him.
- Or worse.

14:38.443 --> 14:40.707
I'm not gonna let anybody get hurt.

14:41.679 --> 14:44.773
- I need to get going.
- Elena.

14:45.016 --> 14:48.918
Please, Stefan,
there's only so much I can take.

14:58.897 --> 15:00.660
What are you doing?

15:01.199 --> 15:04.464
Just contemplating
the next hundred years.

15:05.403 --> 15:06.665
Hmm.

15:10.575 --> 15:12.304
Why did you do it?

15:12.543 --> 15:14.272
I was...

15:14.979 --> 15:16.606
...bored.

15:18.483 --> 15:20.974
You did this to me out of boredom?

15:21.185 --> 15:23.915
It's one of the pitfalls of eternity.

15:27.225 --> 15:30.422
I'm bored. All I can think about is blood.
I just want some blood.

15:30.595 --> 15:32.995
I can't think about anything else.
What is that about?

15:33.164 --> 15:35.223
Ha, ha. That'll ease up.

15:35.400 --> 15:37.129
You've just been cooped up all day.

15:37.936 --> 15:40.268
- Let's go.
- Where?

15:40.438 --> 15:43.771
Well, your life was pathetic.
Your afterlife doesn't have to be.

15:50.014 --> 15:52.482
- What are you doing?
- She's been cooped up all day.

15:52.650 --> 15:54.140
- She's not Anne Frank.
- No, no.

15:54.352 --> 15:58.345
- Hey, hey. Now's not the time for this.
- Lf you're gonna teach her, teach her.

15:58.523 --> 16:01.151
- Show her what it's all about.
- She could hurt someone.

16:01.326 --> 16:05.490
I'm not taking her to Disneyland.
We're going to the front yard.

16:05.663 --> 16:07.221
Come on.

16:12.236 --> 16:13.999
Bad idea, Damon.

16:14.172 --> 16:16.640
She's a vampire, Stefan.
She should know the perks.

16:16.808 --> 16:18.332
Like what?

16:19.477 --> 16:20.501
Like...

16:23.281 --> 16:25.772
Whoa. How did you do that?

16:31.255 --> 16:35.248
Come on, Vicki. Live a little.
No pun intended.

16:50.775 --> 16:53.369
Uh... Tsk.

16:53.544 --> 16:54.875
My bad.

17:20.538 --> 17:23.439
- Matt
- Vicki?

17:23.674 --> 17:24.902
Is that you?

17:25.443 --> 17:27.172
Hey.

17:27.345 --> 17:28.436
Get in here.

17:32.617 --> 17:33.948
In a minute. L...

17:35.186 --> 17:37.882
Please come inside. I've been worried.

17:43.094 --> 17:44.857
Thank God you're okay.

17:45.029 --> 17:46.826
I'm fine.

17:52.904 --> 17:56.738
- Where were you, Vick?
- It's no big deal. Drop it already.

17:56.908 --> 17:59.103
Three people were murdered
in the woods.

17:59.277 --> 18:02.246
The cops were looking for you.
They wanna question you.

18:02.413 --> 18:05.109
- They know where I live.
- Everyone was worried about you.

18:05.283 --> 18:07.376
I'm back now. Just let it go.

18:08.219 --> 18:11.711
Are you kidding? I had a freaking
search party out looking for you...

18:11.889 --> 18:16.292
...while you were off on your crazy
drug trip, and you want me to let it go?

18:18.763 --> 18:21.254
- My head hurts.
- You think?

18:28.306 --> 18:30.365
- What are you doing here
- Is Vicki home?

18:30.575 --> 18:31.803
- Yeah.
- Can I see her?

18:31.976 --> 18:34.604
- I don't want him in here.
- Did he do something to you?

18:34.779 --> 18:38.442
- No. I just don't want him in here.
- Let me come in so I can explain myself.

18:38.616 --> 18:43.076
I don't know what's going on, but I think
you should leave. Right now, Stefan.

18:48.960 --> 18:52.760
You gotta call me, Vick. I don't get it.
What's going on with you? Just...

18:52.930 --> 18:54.659
Just call me, please.

18:58.469 --> 19:00.027
Hey.

19:00.671 --> 19:02.969
So, um, do you wanna hang out tonight?

19:03.141 --> 19:06.338
We could go to the Halloween thing
at school. Could be fun.

19:08.179 --> 19:11.012
Cool. Sure. Sounds fun. Can't wait.

19:11.182 --> 19:14.777
I know you're upset about Vicki.
I heard she called Matt.

19:14.952 --> 19:17.352
But you can't be with her.
She needs to get better.

19:17.522 --> 19:19.854
The best thing you can do for her
is let her go.

19:20.024 --> 19:22.049
What does that even mean, "let her go"?

19:22.226 --> 19:25.662
Oh, okay, sure. Since we're such experts
on letting people go, right?

19:25.830 --> 19:30.028
I know you may not see it,
but trust me, Jer, it's for the best.

19:33.504 --> 19:35.995
For months after Mom and Dad died,
I felt like crap.

19:36.174 --> 19:39.143
Like nothing-really-even-mattered crap.

19:39.343 --> 19:43.143
All of a sudden, I get these moments,
and things started to feel a bit better.

19:43.314 --> 19:45.805
And Vicki
was in every single one of them.

19:46.717 --> 19:50.050
So you may not see it, but trust me...

19:50.221 --> 19:53.384
...keeping me away from her
is not for the best.

20:48.279 --> 20:50.747
Cider for the ladies?
It's a Lockwood special.

20:50.915 --> 20:53.748
Oh, no way. Last year,
I was hung-over until Thanksgiving.

20:53.918 --> 20:54.942
Lightweight.

20:55.152 --> 20:58.553
I am going to drink until someone
is hot enough to make out with.

20:59.056 --> 21:00.614
Sounds like a plan.

21:02.126 --> 21:05.755
- How many martinis have you had?
- Ugh, don't start with me.

21:05.930 --> 21:07.056
Can we go now?

21:07.265 --> 21:09.790
- We're late for the party. Let's go.
- So go ahead.

21:09.967 --> 21:12.299
I'd like to finish my drink.

21:34.325 --> 21:36.122
Let me guess.

21:36.560 --> 21:38.323
- Daisy Buchanan.
- Ha, ha.

21:38.496 --> 21:42.296
- I love a good Gatsby look.
- I've met you before.

21:42.466 --> 21:46.334
- Aren't you Caroline Forbes' boyfriend?
- Ah, she had a schoolgirl crush on me, but...

21:46.504 --> 21:49.940
It was cute,
but I had to let her down easy.

21:50.441 --> 21:53.103
- It's Damon, right?
- Oh, you remember.

21:53.311 --> 21:55.711
Oh, you have a face that's hard to forget.

21:56.447 --> 21:58.779
What's your last name, Damon?

21:59.116 --> 22:01.050
- Salvatore.
- Salvatore?

22:01.218 --> 22:02.242
Mm-hm.

22:02.420 --> 22:04.650
- Are you any relation to Zach?
- Zach's my uncle.

22:07.124 --> 22:09.319
How do you know Zach?

22:12.163 --> 22:14.028
Are you okay?

22:14.231 --> 22:16.961
Yeah. I think
there's something in my eye.

22:17.134 --> 22:21.400
Well, I know Zach
from the Founder's Council.

22:21.639 --> 22:25.700
You know, the Salvatores
were one of this town's original settlers.

22:25.876 --> 22:29.812
Yes, they were.
I wasn't aware that Zach was a member.

22:30.014 --> 22:33.040
I recently moved back home
and haven't really had a chance...

22:33.217 --> 22:36.653
...to meet many of his friends.
- Will you tell him to return my calls?

22:36.821 --> 22:41.121
- I've left several messages.
- Zach went out of town for a bit.

22:43.561 --> 22:45.495
But if it's about the vervain...

22:46.364 --> 22:49.663
- You know about the vervain?
- Well, I'm a Salvatore.

22:49.834 --> 22:51.825
- Of course I do.
- Of course.

22:53.704 --> 22:55.535
Cheers.

23:01.779 --> 23:03.508
Well, watch out.

23:07.785 --> 23:09.685
- Aah!
- Aah!

23:17.294 --> 23:19.091
You went with last year's costume too.

23:19.296 --> 23:21.526
I didn't know I was coming
till an hour ago.

23:21.732 --> 23:22.858
Me neither.

23:28.539 --> 23:31.235
And you're going as...

23:31.409 --> 23:32.933
...you?

23:36.313 --> 23:38.941
He's not talking to me right now.
We got into a fight.

23:39.116 --> 23:41.277
I got into it with Vick too
when she got home.

23:41.452 --> 23:44.751
I'm trying not to smother her, but part of
me didn't wanna let her out of my sight.

23:44.922 --> 23:46.822
- She's here?
- Yeah. You can't miss her.

23:46.991 --> 23:49.221
She's a vampire.

23:49.393 --> 23:51.588
- Where did Jeremy go?
- Elena, what's the matter?

23:51.762 --> 23:53.491
I gotta find him.

24:24.962 --> 24:26.122
You're following me now?

24:26.330 --> 24:28.821
You didn't really give me
much of a choice.

24:30.935 --> 24:33.165
- Let me out of here.
- You shouldn't be here.

24:33.370 --> 24:36.635
Crowds like this, it makes it even harder
for you to keep yourself under control.

24:36.841 --> 24:38.035
- I'm fine.
- Really?

24:38.209 --> 24:39.301
- Mm-hm.
- No headache?

24:39.477 --> 24:41.172
Your stomach's not screaming at you?

24:41.345 --> 24:43.540
You're not feeling lightheaded or cranky...

24:43.747 --> 24:47.513
...like if someone looks at you the wrong
way, you could rip their head off?

24:47.685 --> 24:50.381
Do you wanna know what that's called?
It's called hunger.

24:50.554 --> 24:53.546
And it's only gonna get worse
and worse every minute...

24:53.757 --> 24:57.193
...that you pretend
like it's not controlling you.

24:59.063 --> 25:00.257
So you need vervain?

25:00.431 --> 25:04.197
Yes. My husband and I only have left
what his parents left him.

25:04.368 --> 25:08.532
And Zach had promised
that he could supply us with more.

25:08.706 --> 25:12.233
Well, I talk to him all the time.
So why don't I just ask him?

25:12.810 --> 25:14.437
- Hmm.
- Mm.

25:16.981 --> 25:20.348
How much do you need?
I mean, how many people do you think?

25:20.518 --> 25:23.248
- Well, there's our children, of course.
- Of course.

25:23.420 --> 25:29.552
Ha, ha. And friends, family,
and everyone on the council.

25:31.862 --> 25:33.659
The council?

25:34.331 --> 25:36.060
- Zach knows how many.
- Mm.

25:36.233 --> 25:38.531
You know what? I am so late.

25:38.702 --> 25:42.536
My husband is not going
to be happy with me.

25:42.706 --> 25:47.040
Well, are you happy with your husband?

25:47.912 --> 25:50.676
- You're flirting with me.
- You flirted with me first.

25:50.881 --> 25:52.007
True.

25:53.617 --> 25:56.711
Let me escort you to the school.
It's not safe out there alone.

25:56.887 --> 25:58.855
- Mm.
- I mean, I've seen 10 vampires tonight.

26:00.658 --> 26:02.592
Well, if only the real ones
were as easy to find.

26:02.760 --> 26:06.696
- How's that search going?
- Oh, well, we had the Founder's Party.

26:06.864 --> 26:11.631
And anyone who arrived during the day
was eliminated as a suspect.

26:11.802 --> 26:15.033
- Oh.
- And all the rest were just dead ends, so...

26:15.205 --> 26:16.797
- Hmm. Mm.
- Hmm.

26:16.974 --> 26:19.465
- I gotta go.
- Okay.

26:25.115 --> 26:26.776
- Thank God.
- What's the matter?

26:26.951 --> 26:30.478
- I lost track of Jeremy. I was worried.
- What's going on?

26:30.654 --> 26:34.420
- Hey. Everything's fine.
- I told you to quit bothering me.

26:34.625 --> 26:37.423
- No, Vicki, don't do this.
- Matt, he won't leave me alone.

26:37.962 --> 26:39.953
- You need to back off.
- Matt, it's okay.

26:40.130 --> 26:42.428
No, it's not okay.
What the hell is your problem?

26:44.501 --> 26:47.402
Stefan. She's gone.

26:50.774 --> 26:52.571
I'm trying to help her.

27:08.225 --> 27:09.658
Whoa!

27:10.294 --> 27:13.957
- Vick, you scared the hell out of me.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

27:16.033 --> 27:17.500
Come on.

27:17.668 --> 27:19.397
Okay.

27:31.315 --> 27:34.648
So where'd Caroline run off to?

27:34.818 --> 27:37.309
Do yourself a favor
and don't ask me about Caroline.

27:37.488 --> 27:41.356
- Oh, Bonnie. So loyal.
- Just stay away from her.

27:44.161 --> 27:45.651
Where'd you get that?

27:46.930 --> 27:48.659
- From a friend.
- Caroline.

27:49.466 --> 27:51.730
- You know that's mine, don't you?
- Not anymore.

27:51.969 --> 27:53.402
Funny.

27:54.772 --> 27:56.569
- I'd like it back.
- I'm not giving it to you.

27:56.807 --> 27:59.139
I'll give it to Caroline.
She can give it to you.

27:59.309 --> 28:01.709
Or I could just take it right now.

28:46.623 --> 28:47.749
Jeremy.

28:52.362 --> 28:53.920
I was so worried about you.

28:54.098 --> 28:58.194
I'm fine now. But I gotta leave.

28:58.368 --> 29:00.598
What? Where?

29:01.138 --> 29:04.198
I gotta get out of here, Jer.
I can't live at home with Matt.

29:04.374 --> 29:06.706
- He just doesn't get it.
- No, you can't.

29:06.877 --> 29:09.243
You can't just leave.

29:10.380 --> 29:12.405
Come with me.

29:18.555 --> 29:21.820
If you come with me,
we can be together forever.

29:24.161 --> 29:25.753
Okay.

29:25.929 --> 29:27.419
Yeah.

29:40.010 --> 29:41.034
Ow.

29:44.615 --> 29:47.584
Taking that costume a little too far?

29:50.687 --> 29:52.052
- I know.
- So cool.

29:52.222 --> 29:53.314
Man, that was awesome.

29:55.659 --> 29:57.786
What? What is it?

30:05.836 --> 30:07.565
Vicki?

30:11.175 --> 30:14.201
Vicki. Vicki, what the hell?

30:15.212 --> 30:17.271
Oh, my God. Vicki.

30:17.447 --> 30:19.312
Vicki, no! Stop! Vicki!

30:19.783 --> 30:21.478
No! Aah!

30:23.320 --> 30:25.151
Vicki, no!

30:30.227 --> 30:32.491
No!

30:40.304 --> 30:41.328
Vicki.

30:48.212 --> 30:50.544
Go. Get inside.

30:50.714 --> 30:52.477
Go!

31:27.384 --> 31:29.249
Vicki!

31:31.221 --> 31:33.587
Vicki. Vicki!

31:34.057 --> 31:35.115
Vicki!

31:38.195 --> 31:40.891
Vicki. Vicki.

31:43.233 --> 31:44.666
Vicki!

31:55.579 --> 31:57.774
Get him out of here.

32:03.787 --> 32:06.483
- What?
- I need your help.

32:27.344 --> 32:30.711
- What happened to you?
- I did something. I don't know.

32:30.914 --> 32:32.211
It came from my necklace.

32:33.016 --> 32:34.745
Where'd you get that?

32:34.918 --> 32:38.354
It's part of my costume.
It's a piece of junk.

32:38.855 --> 32:40.322
That piece of junk belonged...

32:40.490 --> 32:43.323
...to one of the most powerful witches
of our family.

32:43.493 --> 32:45.961
Let me show you.

32:51.835 --> 32:54.929
There she is. Emily Bennett.

32:55.672 --> 32:58.505
Your great-great-great-great-grandmother.

33:02.112 --> 33:05.138
And there's your necklace.

33:13.357 --> 33:16.451
You should go. I got this.

33:17.828 --> 33:21.457
You did this. This is your fault.

33:21.665 --> 33:24.532
You confuse me
for someone with remorse.

33:29.873 --> 33:33.274
None of this matters to me. None of it.

33:34.411 --> 33:37.574
People die around you.
How could it not matter?

33:37.814 --> 33:40.282
It matters, and you know it.

33:50.594 --> 33:51.891
Mm.

33:55.232 --> 33:57.097
You need to leave.

33:57.501 --> 34:03.201
Your wounds are bleeding,
and you need to leave.

34:26.596 --> 34:29.429
Elena. Hey, have you seen...?

34:29.599 --> 34:31.533
- Whoa. What happened?
- Nothing.

34:31.701 --> 34:34.362
Some idiot with some fake blood got me.

34:34.538 --> 34:37.063
- I'm gonna go home and shower.
- I can't find Vicki.

34:37.574 --> 34:39.701
She totally bailed on me.

34:42.379 --> 34:44.438
I don't know where she is.

34:46.983 --> 34:51.476
Is this what I'm in for?
A lifetime of worrying about her?

34:54.091 --> 34:56.422
You're a good brother, Matt.

34:57.461 --> 34:58.758
Yeah.

34:58.929 --> 35:00.590
Maybe she went home.

35:02.365 --> 35:04.356
Maybe.

35:05.735 --> 35:07.635
Okay.

35:46.610 --> 35:48.339
Where is he?

35:50.013 --> 35:51.037
Inside.

36:13.436 --> 36:16.371
Do you understand
what happened tonight?

36:17.140 --> 36:18.971
No.

36:19.543 --> 36:21.170
I don't understand.

36:21.344 --> 36:27.249
I mean, I know what I saw,
but I don't understand.

36:28.318 --> 36:32.652
- She was going to kill me.
- Now she's dead. Vicki's dead.

36:33.723 --> 36:38.558
- I'm so sorry, Jer. I'm...
- Just make it stop. It hurts.

36:38.762 --> 36:41.390
Shh. It's okay. It's okay.

36:42.165 --> 36:45.692
Why does everybody have to die on me?

36:46.469 --> 36:49.029
Oh, my God. Come here.

37:45.161 --> 37:46.458
Are you okay?

37:52.769 --> 37:54.794
I wanted to help her.

37:58.842 --> 38:01.003
But instead, uh...

38:06.349 --> 38:10.251
- How's he doing?
- He's a mess.

38:10.420 --> 38:12.445
I don't want him
going through this again.

38:12.622 --> 38:14.647
He's just a kid.

38:14.824 --> 38:18.658
Elena, what can I do? L...
What can I do to help? I'll do anything.

38:19.696 --> 38:21.493
Can you make him forget?

38:22.766 --> 38:26.463
- Elena...
- Stefan, please.

38:26.636 --> 38:28.968
I don't know how he'll ever get past this.

38:29.139 --> 38:31.334
I want him to forget
everything that happened.

38:31.508 --> 38:34.807
If I did it, there's no guarantee
that it would work...

38:34.978 --> 38:39.176
...because of who I am,
because of how I live.

38:39.349 --> 38:44.218
- I don't have the ability to do it right.
- I can do it.

38:46.723 --> 38:48.850
If this is what you want...

38:53.129 --> 38:54.994
...l'll do it.

39:01.371 --> 39:03.703
It's what I want.

39:06.609 --> 39:08.008
What do you want him to know?

39:14.851 --> 39:20.187
I want you to tell him
that Vicki left town...

39:20.357 --> 39:22.222
...and she's not coming back.

39:22.892 --> 39:26.692
That he shouldn't look for her
or worry about her.

39:27.397 --> 39:30.889
He's gonna miss her,
but he knows it's for the best.

39:50.720 --> 39:54.281
Part of me wishes that I could forget too.

39:54.958 --> 39:57.392
Forget meeting you...

39:57.560 --> 40:01.894
...finding out what you are,
and everything that's happened since.

40:02.665 --> 40:05.031
If that's what you want.

40:06.936 --> 40:10.428
Yes. It is.

40:12.776 --> 40:17.475
Because I don't want it to be like this.

40:18.615 --> 40:21.675
I don't wanna feel like this.

40:25.688 --> 40:27.918
But I can't.

40:29.058 --> 40:31.993
With everything that's happened...

40:32.695 --> 40:35.425
...I can't lose the way I feel about you.

40:48.511 --> 40:50.138
It's done.
