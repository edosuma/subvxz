WEBVTT

00:32.717 --> 00:35.565
You ever fart and sneeze
at the same time?

00:35.597 --> 00:38.053
You ever barf up something
you know you didn't eat?

00:38.094 --> 00:41.224
I got sick one time
and barfed a whole shrimp.

00:41.261 --> 00:42.504
I mean, I know I chewed it.

00:42.541 --> 00:43.751
I got a better one.

00:43.789 --> 00:46.025
Once, I barfed so hard

00:46.061 --> 00:48.133
that I pulled a string bean
out of my nose.

00:49.932 --> 00:51.361
That was gross.

00:51.404 --> 00:52.746
Oh, that's so slimy.

00:53.901 --> 00:56.715
You know when you just
wake up, and you're sick,

00:56.748 --> 00:58.536
and you're just waiting
to suck it down.

00:58.571 --> 01:01.092
Aw, man you could hawk one
of those ten feet, easy.

01:01.132 --> 01:03.466
No, no, no... it's better
to blow them out your nose.

01:03.500 --> 01:05.387
No, no, it's better to suck.

01:05.420 --> 01:07.460
Now, those are not
the best loogies.

01:07.500 --> 01:09.125
My cousin hawked a loogie

01:09.164 --> 01:10.952
from the top of the
Empire State Building.

01:10.988 --> 01:12.875
Hit a lady in the head.
Killed her.

01:12.908 --> 01:13.955
He's in prison now.

01:13.995 --> 01:15.750
In prison for snot.

01:16.874 --> 01:17.889
Boom, boom.

01:20.138 --> 01:21.698
Okay, you guys, come on.

01:21.803 --> 01:23.363
We place here
in the time capsule...

01:23.403 --> 01:24.929
The sacred shoe box.

01:24.971 --> 01:29.826
Okay, in the sacred shoe box,

01:29.867 --> 01:33.346
the things we do not understand,

01:33.385 --> 01:36.549
to be opened again when all
the mysteries of the universe

01:36.586 --> 01:38.975
have been revealed to us.

01:39.049 --> 01:40.872
Who's first? Kevin.

01:45.226 --> 01:51.870
I found it in my mom's secret
drawer, in this plastic box.

01:57.224 --> 01:58.718
I know what this is.

01:58.761 --> 02:01.248
It goes in the bottom of
the bathtub to stop the drain.

02:01.289 --> 02:02.718
No, it doesn't.
It's a diaphragm.

02:02.761 --> 02:05.061
It prevents the passage
of sperm into the uterus...

02:05.096 --> 02:06.340
in girls.

02:06.375 --> 02:07.717
How do you know that?

02:07.816 --> 02:09.987
I saw it on Nightline.

02:10.024 --> 02:11.136
I'm telling you, Frank,

02:11.175 --> 02:12.998
it goes in the bottom
of the bathtub.

02:13.032 --> 02:15.399
I think it's
a travel drinking cup.

02:15.432 --> 02:17.537
She'll never miss it.

02:17.576 --> 02:19.965
Wait, don't drink out of it
until we know what it is.

02:20.007 --> 02:21.861
Yeah.

02:21.895 --> 02:23.356
Brad.

02:26.663 --> 02:30.111
I found it in my sister's room.

02:30.151 --> 02:33.500
I believe it's
some kind of weapon.

02:35.911 --> 02:38.050
A picture of my dead mother.

02:38.087 --> 02:39.777
How come you're
putting it in the box?

02:39.813 --> 02:42.683
Because I don't know why
my dad keeps all of her pictures

02:42.726 --> 02:46.021
hidden in the attic, and tells
me she looked like Grace Kelley.

02:47.430 --> 02:48.706
Who's Grace Kelley?

02:48.742 --> 02:50.913
Oh, she was a very famous clown.

02:50.981 --> 02:52.574
She was a princess.

02:52.614 --> 02:55.962
And, also...

02:56.005 --> 02:58.525
I don't know what
it's like to have a mother.

02:58.629 --> 03:00.603
We could tell you.

03:00.645 --> 03:04.387
You can't tell somebody
something like that.

03:12.644 --> 03:14.204
Have you ever noticed
that girls don't fart?

03:14.244 --> 03:15.389
My mom farts.

03:16.420 --> 03:17.827
Looks like a boob.

03:17.859 --> 03:21.788
Yeah.
Make them fly around.

03:24.835 --> 03:26.362
My boob's bigger than yours.

03:26.403 --> 03:28.291
Let's see if you can
catch my boob.

03:28.388 --> 03:31.136
You've got, like,
a mosquito bite boob, Frank.

03:31.171 --> 03:32.578
Why don't girls spit?

03:32.610 --> 03:34.552
They're hiding
something from us.

03:34.595 --> 03:36.602
The rules have changed.

03:36.643 --> 03:37.756
Gotcha.

03:37.795 --> 03:39.704
It's a battle of the sexes...

03:39.747 --> 03:44.089
and believe me,
we are way behind.

04:41.630 --> 04:43.092
Shit!

04:43.167 --> 04:45.655
I can't dance.

04:57.374 --> 04:58.487
You see this, Frank?

04:58.526 --> 04:59.933
This little seedling

04:59.965 --> 05:02.835
represents an entire species
of marsh grass.

05:05.342 --> 05:07.382
If it lives,
the wetlands will survive,

05:07.422 --> 05:09.788
Mortlake turtle can return
to its natural habitat,

05:09.821 --> 05:11.282
and birds like the glossy ibis

05:11.325 --> 05:13.333
won't lose another
precious nesting place.

05:13.373 --> 05:16.242
Dad, if you don't get dressed,
we'll be late for school.

05:21.276 --> 05:24.244
Hey, hey, look at this.

05:25.883 --> 05:26.831
You won a prize.

05:26.875 --> 05:28.915
Yeah.

05:31.291 --> 05:32.501
What is that?

05:33.914 --> 05:35.125
Homework.

05:35.163 --> 05:37.530
They're assigning Cosmopolitan
as homework?

05:37.563 --> 05:39.450
No, they assigned this,

05:39.483 --> 05:40.824
but I'm getting nowhere with it.

05:40.859 --> 05:42.549
You can't relate that
to the real world.

05:42.649 --> 05:43.860
Like how?

05:43.898 --> 05:47.029
Like, was Mom a virgin
when you married her?

05:47.066 --> 05:48.659
What are you studying, religion?

05:48.698 --> 05:49.625
Sex.

05:49.658 --> 05:51.000
Are you going to tell me
about Mom or not?

05:51.034 --> 05:52.660
No.

05:52.698 --> 05:54.705
Boy, that's good coffee.
Fresh brewed?

05:54.746 --> 05:55.923
Instant.

05:55.993 --> 05:57.749
Now, how 'bout
if you love someone?

05:57.786 --> 05:59.476
Do you have to have sex
with them?

05:59.513 --> 06:00.658
This can't be instant.

06:00.697 --> 06:02.071
We ran out of beans.

06:02.104 --> 06:03.152
And if you kiss a girl,

06:03.193 --> 06:04.655
what base is that,

06:04.697 --> 06:06.933
and where's the birth canal?

06:06.969 --> 06:08.049
I have a chart.

06:08.089 --> 06:10.325
You never have to have sex
if you don't want to,

06:10.425 --> 06:12.432
kissing a girl's first base,
the birth canal's right there,

06:12.473 --> 06:13.487
and you shouldn't have sex

06:13.529 --> 06:15.122
unless you're in love
and probably married.

06:15.161 --> 06:16.087
Why not?

06:16.120 --> 06:17.494
I don't remember...
it has something to do

06:17.528 --> 06:20.397
with not wanting to have babies
with people you don't know.

06:20.439 --> 06:21.934
It says in this magazine

06:21.976 --> 06:24.180
that there's a spot on
a woman you can touch

06:24.216 --> 06:26.104
to drive her completely insane.

06:27.864 --> 06:30.450
I don't think
the magazine's a good idea.

06:30.488 --> 06:33.357
And in my experience,
there is no such place.

06:33.399 --> 06:34.326
Dad.

06:34.359 --> 06:35.537
What?

06:35.575 --> 06:39.699
When I grow up, do I have
to have hair all over my body?

06:39.735 --> 06:41.972
You saw your sister
naked in the shower?

06:42.007 --> 06:43.152
Sort of.

06:43.191 --> 06:45.646
I was hiding
in the laundry basket.

06:45.687 --> 06:47.214
Hey, Stacey.

06:47.255 --> 06:49.327
Hi, Brad.

06:49.366 --> 06:51.438
I saw you in
the drug store yesterday.

06:51.478 --> 06:53.300
You were buying Juicy Fruit gum.

06:53.334 --> 06:54.740
Are you going to
the dance Saturday?

06:54.774 --> 06:56.846
It's a '50s sock hop,
you know.

06:56.886 --> 06:58.741
I'm thinking of going
to the dance.

06:59.862 --> 07:01.836
Can I wear
your jacket today, Brad?

07:03.637 --> 07:05.361
Oh, come on,
what do you want for it?

07:11.925 --> 07:14.772
I want to take you
to the closet...

07:14.805 --> 07:16.331
No way!

07:16.373 --> 07:18.161
You are so bad.

07:19.989 --> 07:21.004
What'd you say to her?

07:21.045 --> 07:23.215
I told her what I wanted.

07:23.252 --> 07:24.528
I don't think
she's that kind of girl.

07:24.564 --> 07:25.512
She's a girl, Frank.

07:25.556 --> 07:27.444
All girls are
that kind of girl.

07:27.476 --> 07:29.931
She didn't used to be a girl.

07:30.004 --> 07:31.859
Hey, guys.

07:31.956 --> 07:35.251
What are we looking at?

07:47.795 --> 07:49.136
What's that?

07:52.627 --> 07:55.049
I think it's an elbow.

07:55.091 --> 07:57.741
What's it doing
with that other elbow?

08:01.522 --> 08:03.083
Doesn't look like anything

08:03.122 --> 08:05.261
I ever want to do,
that's for sure.

08:07.186 --> 08:09.325
Will you stop cleaning?
Why do you do that?

08:09.362 --> 08:11.981
My dad demands complete
order and sanitation.

08:14.769 --> 08:17.868
I know a place where the girls
are naked all the time,

08:17.969 --> 08:23.435
where guys can see naked girls
all they want, 24 hours a day

08:23.473 --> 08:27.248
for anyone with guts
and a hundred bucks.

08:27.281 --> 08:29.070
I don't believe
such a place exists.

08:29.105 --> 08:31.308
Where is this?
What are you talking about?

08:31.408 --> 08:33.383
The city.

08:33.424 --> 08:35.311
We're not allowed
to go to the city.

08:35.344 --> 08:36.717
In the city
there are no rules.

08:36.751 --> 08:38.345
Everything is possible,

08:38.384 --> 08:40.839
and everything is available
for a price.

08:40.945 --> 08:43.465
Lucky for us,
our needs are small.

08:43.504 --> 08:45.871
What are our needs?

08:45.904 --> 08:50.572
To see a woman naked.

09:29.357 --> 09:30.950
Let me see the money.

09:30.989 --> 09:32.069
Come on, let me see the money.

09:32.109 --> 09:33.484
The money.

09:33.517 --> 09:35.175
Let me see the money.

09:35.213 --> 09:36.325
The money.

09:48.716 --> 09:50.342
Keep it moving.

09:50.380 --> 09:52.420
Come on, come on,
give me the money.

09:52.460 --> 09:53.572
All right, come on.

09:53.611 --> 09:54.723
Keep it running smoothly.

09:54.763 --> 09:56.170
Looks beautiful on you.

09:56.203 --> 09:57.764
Give me the money.
Thank you.

09:57.803 --> 09:59.559
That sure is a lot
of milk money.

09:59.595 --> 10:00.523
Kevin, some things

10:00.555 --> 10:02.660
are more important
than milk, all right?

10:02.699 --> 10:05.798
Well, what do you need
all this money for, anyway?

10:05.835 --> 10:07.079
Oh, we're going
to buy a pros...

10:08.235 --> 10:09.413
...thetic leg.

10:09.451 --> 10:10.792
For his dog.

10:10.826 --> 10:12.681
His dog lost his leg.

10:25.675 --> 10:26.819
So, what'd you tell your dad?

10:26.857 --> 10:28.319
I said I was eating
at Kevin's house.

10:28.361 --> 10:29.703
I said I was eating
at Brad's house.

10:29.737 --> 10:31.810
I said I was eating
at Frank's house.

10:31.849 --> 10:33.158
Whoo, yeah!

10:33.225 --> 10:34.687
You think the city's big.

10:34.729 --> 10:35.711
It's huge!

10:35.753 --> 10:37.892
And lots of naked ladies.

10:39.273 --> 10:41.728
If I had my own naked lady,
I'd never leave my room.

10:41.833 --> 10:44.483
If you had your own naked lady,
I'd never leave your room.

10:44.521 --> 10:46.146
So, hold on...
do you got the money?

10:46.185 --> 10:48.192
We got everything!

10:48.232 --> 10:50.403
Whoo!

11:21.478 --> 11:23.366
Oh, no.

11:30.054 --> 11:32.258
I want to go back.

11:42.693 --> 11:44.581
Hey, the footpath's for virgins.

11:44.613 --> 11:46.107
We are virgins!

11:46.150 --> 11:47.808
Hey, not for long.

11:47.845 --> 11:49.984
If you guys get killed,
I'm going home.

11:56.996 --> 11:58.458
Beautiful.

12:06.117 --> 12:07.971
Oh, my God.

12:08.003 --> 12:09.018
Do you believe this?

12:09.092 --> 12:10.237
This woman

12:10.275 --> 12:12.097
gave birth to her own head,

12:12.132 --> 12:14.750
and it sang to her.

12:14.787 --> 12:19.228
- Wow.
- Wow.

12:20.835 --> 12:22.591
Hey, Cash, where you going?

12:24.547 --> 12:26.172
You don't ask me that.

12:26.211 --> 12:27.836
Never ask me that!

12:27.874 --> 12:30.296
Okay, I'm sorry.
I just forgot for a second.

12:35.074 --> 12:37.146
Guys, come here.

13:09.153 --> 13:11.356
This is going to be
tougher than we thought.

13:11.393 --> 13:13.848
How do we tell a prostitute
from everybody else?

13:13.889 --> 13:16.310
Yeah, how do we know
we're not asking a ballerina,

13:16.352 --> 13:19.035
or a lawyer, or a math teacher
to take off her clothes?

13:19.072 --> 13:21.144
We just got
to go for it.

13:21.184 --> 13:23.453
Frank, I think
I need to see the money.

13:24.832 --> 13:26.654
Excuse me, miss,
do you have a minute?

13:29.376 --> 13:30.620
Uh, ma'am?

13:30.656 --> 13:31.865
Get out of my way.

13:38.527 --> 13:39.454
Excuse me.

13:39.487 --> 13:40.414
Yes?

13:40.447 --> 13:42.389
Are you a prostitute?

13:42.431 --> 13:43.511
What?

13:43.551 --> 13:46.366
Will you take your clothes off
for $103.62?

13:50.814 --> 13:53.018
Thanks, Kevin.

13:53.054 --> 13:54.941
What? What'd I do?

14:02.206 --> 14:03.994
- You all right?
- No.

14:04.030 --> 14:05.971
Guys...

14:07.645 --> 14:09.369
You guys need some help?

14:09.405 --> 14:10.649
Are you talking to us?

14:10.686 --> 14:11.613
Yeah.

14:11.646 --> 14:13.020
We want to see a naked lady.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.428
How much money you got?

14:14.461 --> 14:17.363
$103.62.

14:17.405 --> 14:18.867
Really?

14:18.909 --> 14:21.396
That'll do it.
Come on.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.915
Right through here.
Come on, come on, come on.

14:42.683 --> 14:43.959
Where?

14:46.459 --> 14:48.663
There are naked women in here?

14:54.650 --> 14:56.755
Guys, you got to trust me.

14:56.794 --> 14:58.867
Why should we trust you?

14:58.906 --> 15:00.695
Because I got a gun.

15:07.418 --> 15:10.615
Okay, open up, big boy.

15:15.161 --> 15:16.502
Okay, backpacks.

15:16.537 --> 15:18.097
Come on, do it.
Do it now!

15:19.737 --> 15:22.126
I'm full, I'm full.

15:22.169 --> 15:23.893
He's got a gun.

15:23.929 --> 15:25.423
Get down, get down.

15:25.465 --> 15:26.774
Stay down.

15:26.809 --> 15:28.215
Stay.

15:30.808 --> 15:31.856
Stay.

15:36.440 --> 15:37.684
You okay?

15:37.720 --> 15:39.509
Yeah.

15:43.576 --> 15:44.786
Get us out of here!

15:47.384 --> 15:48.790
Hey! Hey, wait a minute!

15:48.823 --> 15:50.547
Wait a minute!
Son of a bitch!

15:51.959 --> 15:53.169
I want my money!

15:53.207 --> 15:55.662
Oh, goddamn it!

16:00.568 --> 16:01.581
You all right?

16:01.622 --> 16:02.800
Yeah.

16:07.382 --> 16:10.099
How am I going to get home?

16:10.134 --> 16:12.370
I'm going to get in such trouble
for this.

16:12.406 --> 16:14.773
Us, too.

16:14.806 --> 16:15.821
Shit.

16:15.862 --> 16:18.130
Well, I'm out of here.

16:18.165 --> 16:19.441
You better go.

16:36.532 --> 16:38.921
Do you need any help, ma'am?

16:38.965 --> 16:40.491
Ma'am?

16:40.533 --> 16:42.736
No, thanks.

16:42.772 --> 16:44.877
You sure you don't need
something?

16:44.916 --> 16:47.916
I need 100 bucks,
or I'm going to get smacked.

16:47.957 --> 16:49.964
You got that?

16:50.068 --> 16:51.628
Yes, I do.

16:51.667 --> 16:54.220
You can have it.
You saved my life.

16:55.347 --> 16:57.551
What are you doing
with all that money?

16:57.587 --> 16:59.791
We wanted to see
a naked lady.

16:59.828 --> 17:01.202
Oh, God.

17:01.235 --> 17:02.163
You know what?

17:02.195 --> 17:04.170
Why don't you take
that money and go home,

17:04.211 --> 17:05.488
before you get hurt, okay?

17:05.522 --> 17:07.498
I... I wish I could, but...

17:07.539 --> 17:12.045
it means a lot to my friends,
and we just want a look.

17:14.290 --> 17:15.883
How much looking?

17:15.954 --> 17:17.929
As much as money can buy.

17:19.154 --> 17:21.325
Okay.

17:24.945 --> 17:26.155
Thank you.

17:27.377 --> 17:29.744
Okay, pull your shirts up
over your heads.

17:33.041 --> 17:34.797
You first.

17:34.833 --> 17:36.872
Show me yours,
and I'll show you mine.

17:36.913 --> 17:38.374
Our what?

17:38.416 --> 17:39.977
Armpits, come on.

17:40.017 --> 17:42.187
Come on.

17:48.432 --> 17:50.853
Okay, you're not hairy enough
to be dangerous.

17:53.744 --> 17:55.086
We're not hairy at all.

17:55.120 --> 17:57.007
So, what's your name, lady?

17:57.040 --> 17:58.284
V.

17:58.319 --> 17:59.977
Like the letter?

18:00.015 --> 18:02.666
What's it stand for?

18:02.703 --> 18:03.750
What's your name?

18:03.791 --> 18:05.001
Kevin.

18:05.038 --> 18:06.282
I'm Frank.

18:06.319 --> 18:07.333
Brad.

18:35.117 --> 18:36.546
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

18:40.845 --> 18:43.267
Oh, God.

18:44.653 --> 18:46.409
Come on, come in.

18:49.868 --> 18:51.297
Excuse me.

19:02.188 --> 19:03.649
What do we do now?

19:03.691 --> 19:05.153
Just ask her to...
you know.

19:05.196 --> 19:06.886
You kids see a lot of hookers?

19:06.922 --> 19:10.403
No, this is our first one.

19:10.443 --> 19:12.166
Why do you have

19:12.203 --> 19:13.763
a picture of Grace Kelley?

19:13.803 --> 19:15.079
'Cause I'd like to be like her:

19:15.115 --> 19:16.489
Marry a prince
and never get old.

19:16.522 --> 19:19.239
When you take your clothes off
for money, do you get cold?

19:19.275 --> 19:20.933
Depends on the room.

19:20.970 --> 19:23.425
I have this dream
that I'm naked at school,

19:23.530 --> 19:26.312
and I have to get home
without anyone seeing me.

19:26.410 --> 19:28.133
I have that dream, too.

19:28.170 --> 19:29.992
Last time I had that dream,

19:30.026 --> 19:32.327
there was an alligator
chasing me.

19:32.362 --> 19:33.671
You ever get that one?

19:33.706 --> 19:34.633
Nope.

19:34.666 --> 19:35.909
Do you ever watch cartoons?

19:36.010 --> 19:36.708
Yes.

19:36.746 --> 19:37.640
Are you married?

19:38.666 --> 19:40.869
Boy, you ask a lot of questions.

19:40.905 --> 19:42.978
The meter's ticking.

19:44.841 --> 19:46.630
She's on the bed.
She's on the bed!

19:46.665 --> 19:48.225
Now, how do you
want to do this:

19:48.265 --> 19:49.574
standing up or on the bed?

19:49.609 --> 19:50.624
I'll stand.

19:50.665 --> 19:52.836
I meant me, not you.

19:54.345 --> 19:55.458
- On the bed.
- On the bed.

19:55.497 --> 19:56.423
On the bed.

19:56.456 --> 19:57.765
Bed.

19:57.799 --> 20:00.221
Okay. Come here.

20:08.359 --> 20:10.247
Do you want the lights
on or off?

20:16.263 --> 20:17.790
Is she naked yet?

20:17.831 --> 20:19.653
Don't start until I can see.

20:19.687 --> 20:22.174
You turned off the lights.
We can't see.

20:24.135 --> 20:25.247
All set?

20:42.598 --> 20:43.711
What's the matter?

20:43.750 --> 20:46.083
- I can't do it.
- I want to be a gentleman.

20:46.117 --> 20:49.433
Doesn't a gentleman bring enough
for everybody?

20:51.941 --> 20:55.618
This is the greatest moment
of my life.

20:58.341 --> 21:01.723
Okay, that's it. Time's up.

21:01.765 --> 21:04.131
Any questions?

21:05.988 --> 21:07.581
After sex, you smoke.

21:07.620 --> 21:08.766
It's a rule.

21:08.804 --> 21:11.422
Anybody have any matches?

21:12.836 --> 21:14.843
- No.
- No.

21:16.228 --> 21:18.748
I feel it now. We're different.

21:18.788 --> 21:20.412
How?

21:20.515 --> 21:22.784
We're men.

21:24.451 --> 21:27.680
Yeah.
Men without bikes.

21:29.571 --> 21:31.393
Oh, boy.

21:45.954 --> 21:49.216
Waltzer, Waltzer, look,
don't worry.

21:49.250 --> 21:51.487
Your cut's waiting for you,
that's right.

21:52.929 --> 21:54.555
Relax. Relax.

21:54.593 --> 21:56.666
Look, I tell you what...

21:58.145 --> 21:59.072
Right.

21:59.105 --> 22:01.625
Look, if you don't get all
of your dough,

22:01.665 --> 22:02.713
feel free to kill me.

22:10.400 --> 22:13.270
What do I look like, huh?

22:13.312 --> 22:15.865
A Laundromat?

22:15.904 --> 22:17.726
A slot machine?

22:19.040 --> 22:20.218
'Cause I am not a slot machine.

22:20.256 --> 22:21.598
You are a slot machine.

22:21.632 --> 22:23.575
Step right up here, folks,
there's a winner every minute.

22:23.616 --> 22:25.525
Sorry.

22:27.296 --> 22:28.757
Oh, what,
I... I hurt your feelings?

22:28.799 --> 22:29.727
No.

22:29.759 --> 22:31.036
No, and you want to know why?

22:31.071 --> 22:33.460
'Cause you don't got
no feelings.

22:33.503 --> 22:34.431
Yes, I do.

22:34.463 --> 22:37.147
I'm a person,
and I have feelings.

22:37.215 --> 22:39.637
Oh, ho, you're a person now.

22:41.855 --> 22:43.959
Hey, she's not a person,
is she, Betty?

22:43.998 --> 22:46.300
Yeah, she sort of is.

22:46.334 --> 22:47.512
Nobody's talking to you.

22:49.022 --> 22:50.745
You know what
the test is, baby?

22:50.782 --> 22:51.928
If you were a person,

22:51.966 --> 22:53.788
you could do
whatever you want...

22:54.782 --> 22:56.026
and you can't,

22:56.062 --> 22:58.615
'cause you do whatever
I tell you to do,

22:58.654 --> 22:59.962
isn't that right, Betty?

22:59.997 --> 23:02.233
Yeah.

23:02.269 --> 23:05.116
I, on the other hand,
am a person.

23:05.149 --> 23:06.491
I do what I want.
I take what I want.

23:06.525 --> 23:08.380
I don't have to answer
to nobody.

23:08.413 --> 23:10.236
Everybody answers to somebody.

23:10.269 --> 23:11.546
You answer to Waltzer,

23:11.581 --> 23:13.556
Waltzer answers
to Jerry the Pope.

23:13.661 --> 23:15.963
Oh, oh, you think so, huh?

23:15.998 --> 23:17.404
Yeah.

23:17.468 --> 23:19.475
Waltzer steals from Jerry,
I steal from Waltzer.

23:19.516 --> 23:20.978
They think that this
is their turf,

23:21.020 --> 23:22.002
but they're wrong.

23:22.044 --> 23:23.059
This all belongs to me.

23:23.100 --> 23:24.115
I'm the man.

23:24.220 --> 23:26.937
Yeah... you're the man, Cash.

23:26.972 --> 23:28.859
Yeah, that's right.

23:33.435 --> 23:36.217
Yeah, and the man's got
to go out.

23:37.787 --> 23:41.715
Don't neither of yous two move
until I get back.

23:47.163 --> 23:49.912
I am a person.
I'm a human being.

23:49.947 --> 23:51.059
Yeah.

24:06.553 --> 24:09.270
Tell the asshole
I'm borrowing his car.

24:09.305 --> 24:10.996
Hey, you can't do that, V.

24:11.033 --> 24:13.106
Oh, yes, I can.

24:20.666 --> 24:23.665
Didn't your mothers tell you
not to play in the rain?

24:49.432 --> 24:50.894
Bye. Thanks.

24:50.936 --> 24:51.863
Thank you.

24:51.896 --> 24:55.191
See you guys.

25:02.167 --> 25:03.444
This is where you live?

25:03.479 --> 25:05.967
Yep. The yellow house
over there.

25:06.007 --> 25:08.146
Do you like it?

25:08.182 --> 25:11.313
Yeah, it's okay.

25:25.846 --> 25:27.504
It was nice meeting you.

25:27.541 --> 25:29.364
Likewise.

25:29.398 --> 25:31.536
You're a very well-behaved
young man, you know.

25:31.572 --> 25:32.717
Thanks.

25:32.757 --> 25:35.244
All right.

25:35.285 --> 25:36.746
Veronica.

25:37.717 --> 25:39.789
Virginia?

25:39.829 --> 25:41.258
West Virginia?

25:41.365 --> 25:43.951
Good-bye.

25:48.308 --> 25:50.250
I never really looked,
you know.

25:50.292 --> 25:51.721
I didn't see anything.

26:13.618 --> 26:15.626
That was funny.

26:17.747 --> 26:20.648
Dad!

26:20.689 --> 26:23.210
Hey!

26:23.250 --> 26:26.566
Looks like TV.

26:46.385 --> 26:48.873
Can I use your phone?

26:51.025 --> 26:53.130
The phone's over here.

26:53.233 --> 26:54.639
Where are your parents?

26:54.672 --> 26:55.850
I only have one.

26:55.888 --> 26:56.968
A father.

26:57.072 --> 26:58.217
He's in the Tonapiya
Wetlands.

26:58.256 --> 26:59.434
What's that?

26:59.472 --> 27:01.709
Well, this was all once
the Tonapiya Wetlands.

27:01.744 --> 27:04.526
He's trying to save
the last five acres,

27:04.560 --> 27:05.804
but he won't.

27:05.840 --> 27:06.768
Why?

27:06.800 --> 27:08.327
No money.

27:08.368 --> 27:10.953
He teaches science by day,
and, I don't know,

27:10.991 --> 27:13.064
tries to save the wetlands
by night.

27:13.103 --> 27:15.078
I admire him,
but I pity him, too.

27:15.119 --> 27:16.646
You pity him?

27:16.687 --> 27:19.436
Well, yeah,
his goals aren't realistic.

27:20.654 --> 27:22.215
That's him.

27:22.255 --> 27:23.629
Wait a minute...

27:23.663 --> 27:25.321
maybe he shouldn't find me here,
you know?

27:25.359 --> 27:28.805
Why not?
He's seen grown-ups before.

27:28.846 --> 27:30.089
Hey, Dad.

27:30.126 --> 27:31.719
Hey, Frank.

27:33.262 --> 27:34.374
Dad, look.

27:34.414 --> 27:35.690
Over there.

27:35.726 --> 27:37.133
It's a girl.

27:37.166 --> 27:39.687
I know.

27:39.726 --> 27:41.798
What do you say?

27:41.838 --> 27:42.950
Thank you?

27:42.990 --> 27:44.037
To her, to her.

27:46.509 --> 27:48.614
Dad, this is V.

27:48.653 --> 27:51.402
V, this is Dad.

27:52.621 --> 27:53.799
Hello.

27:53.837 --> 27:58.442
Hello... Dad.

28:06.604 --> 28:08.360
What's she doing here?

28:08.396 --> 28:09.574
Her car broke down.

28:09.611 --> 28:10.986
Yeah, but who is she?

28:11.020 --> 28:12.646
She's, uh...

28:12.684 --> 28:14.440
she's Brad's new math tutor.

28:14.476 --> 28:17.258
She gave me a ride home
from his house,

28:17.291 --> 28:19.592
and then her car
wouldn't start.

28:26.379 --> 28:27.590
You know what it is?

28:27.627 --> 28:29.350
Well, it's not the starter.

28:30.699 --> 28:31.626
Tom.

28:31.659 --> 28:32.586
Larry.

28:32.619 --> 28:33.546
Wow.

28:33.579 --> 28:35.912
So, Frank was telling me
what you do.

28:35.946 --> 28:37.058
Really?

28:37.098 --> 28:39.553
Yeah. Do you enjoy it?

28:39.594 --> 28:41.536
Enjoy it?

28:42.826 --> 28:44.102
Sometimes.

28:44.138 --> 28:45.796
Yeah, you get to move around,

28:45.834 --> 28:47.809
change of scenery,
meet new people.

28:47.850 --> 28:48.832
Well...

28:48.874 --> 28:50.335
I never thought of it
that way.

28:50.378 --> 28:52.068
You seem like
a real people person.

28:52.105 --> 28:53.250
Oh.

28:53.289 --> 28:54.882
Outgoing. Not like me.

28:54.921 --> 28:57.572
No?

28:57.609 --> 28:58.918
Thanks.

28:58.953 --> 29:01.539
I bet you're really good at it.

29:02.953 --> 29:04.961
Well, there's only one way
to find out.

29:05.001 --> 29:07.967
Boy, am I glad
to hear you say that...

29:08.008 --> 29:13.224
because it's the one subject
he's having trouble with.

29:13.256 --> 29:15.264
You think you could fit him in?

29:15.304 --> 29:16.449
"Him?"

29:16.488 --> 29:18.398
Frank.

29:18.440 --> 29:21.287
Frank? Are you kidding?

29:21.320 --> 29:22.694
At his age?

29:22.728 --> 29:23.742
Well, I'm afraid

29:23.784 --> 29:24.960
if he doesn't learn it now,

29:24.999 --> 29:26.013
he's never going to.

29:26.055 --> 29:27.581
You know, I would
teach him myself,

29:27.623 --> 29:28.867
but I'm way out of practice.

29:28.903 --> 29:30.015
Ah!

29:30.055 --> 29:32.706
Oh. Um...

29:32.743 --> 29:35.012
You know, you should
never have to practice.

29:35.047 --> 29:37.021
Well, that's easy
for you to say.

29:37.063 --> 29:38.438
You're a professional.

29:38.471 --> 29:39.813
But for us laymen,

29:39.847 --> 29:42.333
if you don't use it,
you lose it.

29:42.374 --> 29:44.610
Well, how long has it been,

29:44.646 --> 29:47.296
you know, since you... used it?

29:47.334 --> 29:51.228
Oh... I use it a little bit
every day, you know...

29:51.270 --> 29:52.415
the bank,
the grocery store...

29:52.454 --> 29:53.382
but it, you know...

29:53.414 --> 29:56.098
It's probably been
a good ten, 15 years

29:56.134 --> 29:58.686
since I was any good at it,
you know.

29:58.725 --> 30:00.830
It doesn't come up that often.

30:04.261 --> 30:06.432
Maybe it's the neighborhood.

30:07.589 --> 30:08.669
Tom.

30:08.709 --> 30:09.821
- Larry.
- Wow.

30:11.525 --> 30:13.565
Well, it's not the battery.

30:16.676 --> 30:19.326
In the morning, I'll check
the fuel line for you,

30:19.364 --> 30:20.706
the alternator, the pump.

30:20.740 --> 30:21.885
You know, it could be

30:21.924 --> 30:23.550
your plugs are worn down.

30:23.588 --> 30:26.207
I'll replace them for you
in the morning.

30:26.244 --> 30:27.706
In the meantime, uh...

30:27.748 --> 30:29.406
could I give you
a ride home?

30:29.444 --> 30:31.680
Um, no, I can walk.

30:37.411 --> 30:39.102
So, what do you think?

30:40.707 --> 30:42.617
Can you help him?

30:42.659 --> 30:45.376
I'd much rather
do something for you.

30:45.411 --> 30:47.800
Well, what could you do for me?

30:47.844 --> 30:50.144
Well, it seems
like you've forgotten

30:50.178 --> 30:51.639
just about everything.

30:51.683 --> 30:55.806
Well, I remember the basics...
but it's...

30:55.906 --> 30:57.467
I'm not concerned about myself.

30:57.506 --> 30:58.684
It's Frank I'm worried about.

30:58.786 --> 31:01.055
You know, it's just not
that important to me anymore.

31:03.459 --> 31:05.879
Poor man.

31:49.536 --> 31:51.161
Look at that woman.

31:51.200 --> 31:52.345
Oh, my God.

31:52.383 --> 31:54.106
Her top is so low.

31:54.143 --> 31:57.175
And her skirt is so high.

31:57.278 --> 31:58.936
That is bad.

31:58.975 --> 32:02.804
It is.
It's very, very bad.

32:06.559 --> 32:08.926
Are you, uh...

32:08.958 --> 32:10.584
what I think you are?

32:10.622 --> 32:13.010
Well, I'm not
the public health nurse.

32:13.053 --> 32:14.711
Would you... like some company?

32:14.749 --> 32:15.763
Yes, I would.

32:15.806 --> 32:16.886
Hi.

32:16.925 --> 32:18.005
Hi, Andy.

32:18.045 --> 32:19.255
Hi, boss.

32:19.294 --> 32:20.341
Hi.

32:20.381 --> 32:22.269
Did you hear that?

32:22.301 --> 32:23.479
That was bad.

32:23.517 --> 32:25.819
That was very, very bad.

32:27.517 --> 32:28.596
Want a date?

32:30.780 --> 32:32.341
I don't think
that's going to work.

32:32.381 --> 32:33.941
That's Reverend Whitehead.

32:33.980 --> 32:36.020
God doesn't let him do that.

32:36.061 --> 32:37.522
Got you an ice cream.

32:37.564 --> 32:39.320
Being on the job
probably makes you hungry.

32:39.356 --> 32:40.283
Thanks.

32:40.316 --> 32:41.243
What are you doing here?

32:41.276 --> 32:42.203
Looking for you.

32:42.236 --> 32:43.796
Where are you going
to sleep tonight?

32:43.837 --> 32:46.902
In a hotel, if you'll get lost
and let me make some money.

32:46.939 --> 32:49.590
I... I don't think
you should be doing this.

32:49.627 --> 32:52.148
What are you,
some kind of child missionary?

32:52.187 --> 32:53.463
Sort of.

32:53.500 --> 32:56.183
I did have an idea
about the sleeping thing.

32:57.628 --> 32:59.056
Hi, Frank.

32:59.100 --> 33:00.660
She spoke to me.

33:00.699 --> 33:03.797
I speak to her,
but she never speaks to me.

33:03.834 --> 33:06.649
Hey, Frank, going to the dance?

33:06.683 --> 33:08.952
I... I can't dance.

33:08.986 --> 33:10.448
Me, neither.

33:10.490 --> 33:13.752
Aren't you going to introduce us
to your friend, Frank?

33:18.234 --> 33:19.662
I'm Frank's father's sister,
Aunt V,

33:19.706 --> 33:21.331
and Frank and I are
very, very close,

33:21.370 --> 33:22.384
aren't we, Frank?

33:23.993 --> 33:25.400
We've got to be going now.

33:25.433 --> 33:26.742
See you later.

33:30.041 --> 33:32.375
Look at the way she walks.

33:32.409 --> 33:33.685
That is bad.

33:33.721 --> 33:36.535
That is very, very bad.

33:48.761 --> 33:50.005
Are you running away?

33:50.040 --> 33:52.047
No. What are you doing?

33:52.089 --> 33:54.771
I'm organizing the fund-raiser.

33:54.807 --> 33:55.952
Again?

33:55.992 --> 33:57.552
There's only two more weeks

33:57.591 --> 33:59.926
before they bulldoze
my five acres.

33:59.991 --> 34:01.900
Who will you invite?

34:03.543 --> 34:05.169
I don't know.

34:07.191 --> 34:08.533
Thanks, pal.

34:10.327 --> 34:12.268
Frank.

34:12.311 --> 34:13.521
You know G?

34:13.559 --> 34:14.735
G?

34:14.775 --> 34:16.400
The math tutor.

34:16.438 --> 34:18.161
Yeah.

34:18.263 --> 34:20.303
She's a Grace Kelly, isn't she?

34:20.342 --> 34:22.960
Yeah.

34:54.068 --> 34:57.003
Light, reading material...

34:57.043 --> 34:58.222
Hey.

34:58.260 --> 35:00.169
dinner with everything...

35:02.260 --> 35:04.813
Oh, great. Thanks.

35:04.852 --> 35:06.739
Pajamas.

35:06.772 --> 35:08.016
Okay.

35:08.084 --> 35:09.578
Turn around.

35:09.619 --> 35:11.146
Why?

35:11.187 --> 35:12.202
Because I'm going
to change,

35:12.243 --> 35:13.585
and you don't have
any more money.

35:13.619 --> 35:16.269
This is sweet.

35:16.307 --> 35:17.616
It was my mom's.

35:17.650 --> 35:19.854
Isn't she going
to miss it?

35:19.891 --> 35:21.265
She died before I was born.

35:21.298 --> 35:22.825
I don't think that's possible.

35:22.866 --> 35:26.958
She died exactly when
I was born, to the minute.

35:26.994 --> 35:28.172
Oh, I'm sorry.

35:28.210 --> 35:30.250
You can
turn around now.

35:35.250 --> 35:36.460
What's this?

35:36.497 --> 35:38.602
Did some rich guy
give it to you?

35:38.642 --> 35:40.430
Is it worth a million bucks?

35:40.466 --> 35:41.676
No.

35:41.714 --> 35:44.561
Oh, did your mom give it to you,
and then she died,

35:44.593 --> 35:46.982
and that's all you have
to remember her by?

35:47.026 --> 35:49.446
No. I stole it.

35:49.488 --> 35:51.855
Oh.

35:51.889 --> 35:53.580
Too bad it's empty.

35:53.616 --> 35:56.911
Too bad you don't have a guy
to put in your locket.

35:56.977 --> 35:59.366
A guy with a house,
a job, a car,

35:59.409 --> 36:01.449
credit cards...

36:01.489 --> 36:02.601
and a son.

36:02.641 --> 36:04.975
Yeah, I know
what you're trying to do,

36:05.009 --> 36:06.633
and it's not going to work.

36:06.672 --> 36:08.428
Well, what am I trying to do?

36:08.464 --> 36:10.700
You want me to go out
with your dad.

36:10.736 --> 36:11.980
No, I don't.

36:12.015 --> 36:13.193
That's good.

36:13.231 --> 36:15.271
I want you to marry my dad.

36:17.040 --> 36:18.250
Let me explain.

36:18.287 --> 36:21.102
I never mix business
with pleasure.

36:21.136 --> 36:22.729
I'm not talking about pleasure.

36:22.767 --> 36:24.709
I'm talking
about you marrying my dad.

36:24.750 --> 36:28.525
But people like your dad
don't marry women like me.

36:28.623 --> 36:32.813
Well... I told him what you did,
and he didn't mind.

36:32.847 --> 36:34.221
I told the truth.

36:34.255 --> 36:36.556
Really?

36:38.286 --> 36:39.660
I don't know.

36:39.693 --> 36:41.832
I think the truth
kind of gets you in trouble.

36:43.597 --> 36:44.841
You know what
you should do?

36:44.942 --> 36:47.724
Find your dad one of those
nice women that we saw in town.

36:47.758 --> 36:49.285
Nice women don't understand him.

36:49.326 --> 36:50.602
I don't even understand him.

36:50.702 --> 36:53.004
He spends all of his time
wading around in mud,

36:53.037 --> 36:54.412
cataloging plants.

36:56.685 --> 37:00.132
Good night. Use the can
if you need anything.

37:00.173 --> 37:01.929
Can?

37:10.668 --> 37:13.034
Looks like a boob.

37:20.619 --> 37:22.724
Hello, V?

37:22.764 --> 37:24.193
V.

37:24.267 --> 37:27.912
V, this is Frank.

37:27.947 --> 37:30.630
From the can.

37:30.667 --> 37:31.911
This is V.

37:33.450 --> 37:36.134
My dad thinks you look
like Grace Kelly.

37:36.171 --> 37:38.081
Good night.

37:41.355 --> 37:43.744
Good night, Frank.

38:15.753 --> 38:18.338
I'm telling you, she slept
in the tree house last night.

38:18.377 --> 38:19.718
You're so full of shit.

38:19.753 --> 38:20.766
Oh, my God... a "C."

38:20.872 --> 38:22.465
My dad is going
to kill me.

38:22.504 --> 38:23.748
What's wrong with a "C"?

38:23.784 --> 38:25.540
Her car broke down
in front of my house.

38:25.576 --> 38:26.525
She had to stay.

38:26.600 --> 38:27.494
She's there right now.

38:27.560 --> 38:28.989
She's going
to tell on us, I know.

38:29.031 --> 38:29.959
She's not there.

38:29.991 --> 38:31.333
I bet you a zillion
billion dollars

38:31.400 --> 38:32.448
that you are full of shit.

38:32.488 --> 38:33.415
You're on.

38:33.448 --> 38:34.375
Name your price.

38:34.408 --> 38:36.164
Your leather jacket.

38:38.087 --> 38:41.021
Oh, thank God... a "D."

38:41.063 --> 38:42.851
- What?
- Oh, no, no.

38:42.887 --> 38:44.643
I'd rather bet
a zillion billion dollars.

38:44.679 --> 38:47.974
Look, if she's not at my house
after school,

38:48.007 --> 38:50.146
I'll be your slave for life.

38:50.183 --> 38:52.223
These are
excellent terms, Brad.

38:52.263 --> 38:53.604
You're toast.

38:57.318 --> 38:58.911
Oh, no.

39:00.262 --> 39:01.788
He got an "F".

39:51.779 --> 39:55.292
Your understanding of
the female reproductive cycle

39:55.331 --> 39:57.240
is simply not satisfactory.

39:57.283 --> 39:59.487
I'm giving you a second chance

39:59.523 --> 40:02.042
by assigning an
oral presentation.

40:02.082 --> 40:05.279
Oral... as in from the mouth?

40:05.314 --> 40:06.689
That's exactly right.

40:06.722 --> 40:09.089
An oral presentation
on the material

40:09.122 --> 40:13.115
with footnotes and visual aids,
due by the end of the week.

40:14.786 --> 40:17.206
What kind of visual aids?

40:17.249 --> 40:18.176
<i>Well, Suzanne,</i>

40:18.209 --> 40:20.118
<i>trash day
in the red light district</i>

40:20.161 --> 40:23.260
<i>took on new meaning today
as one unlucky local resident</i>

40:23.297 --> 40:24.955
<i>made a grisly discovery.</i>

40:24.993 --> 40:28.571
<i>He found sitting innocently
among the trash cans at the curb</i>

40:28.609 --> 40:31.195
<i>the dead body
of an unidentified white male.</i>

40:31.233 --> 40:33.502
<i>The body,
when examined by paramedics,</i>

40:33.537 --> 40:37.562
<i>showed signs of what police are
calling ritualistic mutilation.</i>

40:37.600 --> 40:39.837
Oh, my God.

40:39.904 --> 40:41.726
Oh, my God.

40:41.760 --> 40:43.582
<i>...or release
the name of the victim.</i>

40:43.616 --> 40:47.511
<i>But speculation on the street
is that the killing was related</i>

40:47.616 --> 40:49.754
<i>to drug running and prostitution.</i>

40:49.792 --> 40:50.773
<i>Millionaire importer</i>

40:50.815 --> 40:52.571
<i>and reputed mob boss
Jerry the Pope</i>

40:52.607 --> 40:54.168
<i>denied allegations that moneys</i>

40:54.207 --> 40:55.898
<i>from local prostitution operations</i>

40:55.935 --> 40:58.139
<i>were being funneled
through his corporation.</i>

41:00.223 --> 41:02.557
Hello.

41:02.591 --> 41:03.573
Betty, it's V.

41:03.615 --> 41:04.695
I'm just watching the news.

41:04.735 --> 41:05.663
What happened?

41:05.695 --> 41:09.077
Um... Cash stole from Waltzer,

41:09.118 --> 41:11.900
so Waltzer cut his heart out.

41:13.631 --> 41:15.736
Guess he wasn't a person
after all.

41:15.774 --> 41:18.457
V, Cash said that

41:18.494 --> 41:20.217
you took the money.

41:21.598 --> 41:23.159
That's not true.

41:23.198 --> 41:26.393
I, I believe you, but...

41:26.429 --> 41:30.520
you got to tell Waltzer
in person.

41:35.421 --> 41:36.763
Um...

41:36.797 --> 41:39.252
Tell me where you are,

41:39.293 --> 41:40.951
and I'll come to you.

41:42.781 --> 41:45.202
V?

41:53.020 --> 41:54.646
Got to...

41:54.748 --> 41:56.407
Oh, shit.

42:05.564 --> 42:07.571
Got to get out of here. Okay.

42:12.955 --> 42:14.863
Oh!

42:40.057 --> 42:41.715
Excuse me.

42:41.753 --> 42:42.833
Sorry, excuse me.

42:42.873 --> 42:43.986
Thank you.

42:44.025 --> 42:45.748
Who do I need to find?

42:45.786 --> 42:47.127
What am I doing?

42:47.161 --> 42:48.883
Uh, Dad. Dad.

42:48.920 --> 42:50.960
Find Dad.

43:06.711 --> 43:07.726
Um, excuse me.

43:07.767 --> 43:08.715
I'm looking

43:08.759 --> 43:09.687
for Frank's father.

43:09.719 --> 43:11.607
He's a teacher here.

43:11.639 --> 43:13.941
Oh, what's his goddamn name?

43:13.976 --> 43:15.088
His name is, um...

43:15.127 --> 43:16.883
Tom.

43:16.919 --> 43:19.308
Tom, that's his name.

43:43.830 --> 43:45.804
...the edges on the sedge.

43:45.846 --> 43:47.372
That's one of the ways
you can tell...

43:47.414 --> 43:48.493
sedges have edges.

43:48.534 --> 43:50.541
Now, if you look at
the composition of this soil

43:50.581 --> 43:52.720
closely under a microscope,
you could see traces of

43:52.757 --> 43:54.698
thousands and thousands
of years of evolution.

43:54.741 --> 43:55.788
Thanks, Mr. Wheeler.

43:55.828 --> 43:56.777
You're welcome, Nate.

43:56.821 --> 43:57.933
Mr. Wheeler.

43:57.973 --> 43:58.987
Is this toad flax?

43:59.028 --> 44:00.239
No, that's Impatiens capensis.

44:00.276 --> 44:01.683
That's also known
as touch-me-not.

44:01.717 --> 44:03.375
You guys,
I found a touch-me-not.

44:03.412 --> 44:04.939
Untouched, unspoiled,

44:04.980 --> 44:07.631
here in the middle
of suburban uniformity,

44:07.668 --> 44:12.621
you can find...
a tiny wilderness.

44:12.659 --> 44:13.587
Dad.

44:13.619 --> 44:14.830
Brian, don't be an idiot.

44:14.867 --> 44:16.907
Hey, Dad...

44:19.283 --> 44:20.712
I need to talk to you

44:20.756 --> 44:21.683
for a second.

44:21.716 --> 44:23.504
I didn't know

44:23.540 --> 44:25.001
he had a daughter.

44:25.043 --> 44:26.985
I need you to fix my car.

44:27.028 --> 44:28.849
I was planning on
fixing that after school.

44:28.882 --> 44:29.831
I can't wait that long.

44:29.874 --> 44:30.921
I mean, I need to leave town.

44:31.026 --> 44:32.553
I've got to get out
of here right now.

44:32.594 --> 44:33.804
Tell me about it, lady.

44:33.874 --> 44:35.303
We all want
to get out of here.

44:35.346 --> 44:39.340
Are you late for an appointment
with a client?

44:41.714 --> 44:44.713
Are you a religious fanatic
or something?

44:44.754 --> 44:47.950
No. Why?

44:47.986 --> 44:49.033
Oh...

44:49.073 --> 44:51.310
'cause you're just
the most understanding man

44:51.345 --> 44:52.774
I've ever met.

44:52.817 --> 44:54.443
Thank you.

44:58.098 --> 44:59.723
Wow, look at this place.

44:59.762 --> 45:00.689
What is this?

45:00.722 --> 45:03.339
This is the...
Tanapaya Wet Lands.

45:03.376 --> 45:05.067
What's left of it.

45:05.104 --> 45:07.625
This is the place that
you're trying to save?

45:09.009 --> 45:10.667
It's so beautiful.

45:10.704 --> 45:12.460
You think so?

45:12.497 --> 45:13.544
Yeah.

45:13.584 --> 45:15.559
Why would anybody
want to ruin this?

45:15.600 --> 45:17.640
Well...

45:17.680 --> 45:20.396
Look...

45:20.432 --> 45:22.220
A glossy ibis.

45:25.328 --> 45:29.386
I watch a lot of
documentaries on TV.

45:33.520 --> 45:36.748
You know, maybe I
don't have to leave.

45:36.782 --> 45:42.729
I mean, it's so safe here and
nobody knows about this place.

45:42.767 --> 45:46.280
Except you and me.

45:46.318 --> 45:50.344
Just you and me.

45:50.383 --> 45:52.389
And the 20 of us.

45:54.093 --> 45:56.100
I'll be home by 4:00.

45:56.142 --> 45:57.930
I could fix your car then.

45:57.966 --> 45:59.373
Okay.

45:59.405 --> 46:00.780
Can you manage on foot?

46:00.813 --> 46:03.017
Yeah, I have this, this, um...

46:03.053 --> 46:05.355
I have this old bike here.

46:05.390 --> 46:08.139
Hey, hey, that's my bike.

46:09.260 --> 46:10.438
Oh...

46:13.036 --> 46:14.891
Bye.

46:20.173 --> 46:22.595
It's her car. It's her car.

46:25.420 --> 46:27.722
What are you doing?!

46:27.756 --> 46:29.829
I'm taking a bath.

46:29.868 --> 46:32.039
Why?

46:32.077 --> 46:33.670
Well, because my boss
had his heart ripped out,

46:33.708 --> 46:36.458
and some very bad people
are looking for me,

46:36.492 --> 46:38.248
so I'm staying for a while.

46:38.285 --> 46:39.976
I've seen The Brady Bunch,

46:40.013 --> 46:42.500
nothing bad ever happens
to you people.

46:42.539 --> 46:44.579
I told you.

46:44.619 --> 46:46.408
You got to get rid of her,
she'll tell our parents.

46:46.443 --> 46:47.523
If my dad finds out,
I am dead.

46:47.563 --> 46:48.840
They don't even know
I lost my bike.

46:48.875 --> 46:49.824
You guys, relax.

46:49.867 --> 46:50.816
She's not going to tell.

46:50.860 --> 46:51.787
She's my friend.

46:51.820 --> 46:53.249
She's going to marry my dad.

46:53.292 --> 46:54.786
Marry her? Marry her?

46:54.860 --> 46:55.972
He can't marry her.

46:56.012 --> 46:58.052
No one can marry her,
'cause when people get married

46:58.092 --> 46:59.203
they tell everything.

46:59.243 --> 47:00.584
She'll tell, she'll tell.

47:00.619 --> 47:01.567
They all tell.

47:01.611 --> 47:03.334
Kevin, listen to me.

47:03.370 --> 47:06.185
If she tells,
we'll all say it's Frank.

47:08.426 --> 47:09.408
Fine.

47:10.986 --> 47:11.935
Brad.

47:13.226 --> 47:15.266
You're wearing my jacket.

47:17.482 --> 47:20.199
I thought we bet
a billion zillion dollars.

47:23.977 --> 47:25.406
We need to get
a few things straight.

47:27.178 --> 47:29.992
Dad won't be home
till 4:00... relax.

47:30.026 --> 47:31.008
Look, here's the deal.

47:31.049 --> 47:32.423
You can stay in my tree fort

47:32.456 --> 47:35.042
and you can play in the house
only when Dad's at work.

47:35.144 --> 47:36.093
No smoking,

47:36.137 --> 47:38.657
no swearing, and no
letting Dad know

47:38.697 --> 47:40.104
you're staying here.

47:40.136 --> 47:42.405
And don't take
your clothes off for money.

47:43.561 --> 47:45.950
Anything else?

47:48.457 --> 47:51.456
Yeah, I need some help
with my homework.

47:51.496 --> 47:54.812
What's the subject?

47:54.855 --> 47:57.125
How long do you want me to wait?

47:57.192 --> 47:58.752
Until you're more mature, Frank.

47:58.791 --> 48:00.963
A sexual relationship
with a woman

48:01.032 --> 48:03.137
is a very, very precious thing.

48:03.175 --> 48:04.997
I was talking about dinner.

48:05.032 --> 48:05.979
It's getting cold.

48:06.023 --> 48:09.318
Oh... I knew that.

48:10.983 --> 48:12.030
You ready?

48:12.070 --> 48:12.998
Yeah.

48:13.030 --> 48:15.900
Ready, set, go.

48:42.853 --> 48:43.867
Ah, beat you.

48:49.860 --> 48:52.129
Who was a faster eater,
you or Mom?

48:54.308 --> 48:56.096
We never raced.

48:57.443 --> 48:59.745
What kind of microwave
dinners did she like?

48:59.780 --> 49:01.602
We cooked real food.

49:01.635 --> 49:04.024
You miss real food?

49:04.067 --> 49:06.523
How can I?
I've never eaten it.

49:22.947 --> 49:25.216
All right, everybody,
I want you to sit down.

49:25.251 --> 49:26.712
Okay, come on.

49:26.755 --> 49:29.339
Let's get started. Time.

49:29.377 --> 49:30.654
Sit down.

49:38.050 --> 49:40.701
Do you believe he comes
to school with it on?

49:42.466 --> 49:45.465
Frank, are you ready
to begin your report?

49:46.657 --> 49:48.828
No, not yet.

49:51.169 --> 49:52.794
Owen Meany Junior High.

49:52.833 --> 49:54.971
Just a moment.

49:58.241 --> 49:59.255
Miss Fetch,

49:59.297 --> 50:01.239
please report to the office.

50:01.281 --> 50:03.003
You have a phone call.

50:03.040 --> 50:04.501
All right.

50:04.544 --> 50:06.518
Frank, don't do anything
until I get back.

50:06.559 --> 50:08.086
Of course.

50:16.607 --> 50:18.647
Let's get started.

50:18.687 --> 50:19.701
On what?

50:19.742 --> 50:21.684
Started on what?

50:44.382 --> 50:45.462
Hello.

50:50.174 --> 50:52.214
Hello? Hello?

50:54.141 --> 50:56.051
The line is dead.

50:56.093 --> 50:58.776
This.. is a woman.

51:00.605 --> 51:02.612
These... are her breasts.

51:03.741 --> 51:05.814
They serve an important

51:05.853 --> 51:08.820
biological function
in child-rearing

51:08.861 --> 51:11.926
as both a food source,
and headrests.

51:13.884 --> 51:18.041
Size and shape of breasts
may vary

51:18.076 --> 51:20.443
from person to person,
but number

51:20.476 --> 51:23.258
is constant: one, two.

51:25.852 --> 51:28.273
Please?

51:45.850 --> 51:46.777
Children!

51:46.810 --> 51:48.697
- Who wants me to go on?
- Children!

51:48.730 --> 51:49.810
Unlock this door.

51:51.162 --> 51:53.017
Now, I didn't want to do this,

51:53.082 --> 51:55.057
but it's part of the assignment.

51:55.098 --> 51:59.222
These... are the ovaries.

52:07.897 --> 52:09.326
That's where the eggs are.

52:09.433 --> 52:10.927
Eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs...

52:10.969 --> 52:13.173
Eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs,
eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs.

52:13.241 --> 52:16.056
Each ovary is connected
to its very own Fallopian tube,

52:16.089 --> 52:17.201
- which swings...
- Frank!

52:19.128 --> 52:21.102
...which swings down
sort of like this,

52:21.144 --> 52:22.322
like a little freeway.

52:22.360 --> 52:23.821
I want this door open now!

52:23.864 --> 52:24.879
Leading to...

52:24.920 --> 52:27.408
the uterus...
about this size baby motel.

52:28.888 --> 52:30.132
Just roughly... here.

52:31.160 --> 52:32.337
What?

52:32.376 --> 52:33.041
It tickles.

52:33.080 --> 52:33.842
Oh, sorry.

52:33.879 --> 52:35.918
Where was I?

52:35.959 --> 52:37.715
The uterus.

52:37.751 --> 52:38.896
Excuse me?

52:38.935 --> 52:40.276
"This size baby motel."

52:40.311 --> 52:41.740
Oh, right, right.

52:41.783 --> 52:44.849
Which brings us to...
intercourse.

52:46.231 --> 52:47.987
May I have a volunteer
from the class?

53:05.653 --> 53:07.954
Here's something;
what do you think?

53:09.301 --> 53:11.243
Okay, how about this one?

53:11.284 --> 53:12.462
This is nice.

53:12.500 --> 53:13.842
I don't know.

53:13.876 --> 53:18.797
I, I don't think that I,
I should wear her clothes.

53:18.836 --> 53:19.949
V?

53:19.988 --> 53:21.036
Yeah.

53:21.077 --> 53:22.222
Is it true

53:22.324 --> 53:24.396
there's a place
on a woman you can touch

53:24.435 --> 53:26.028
to make her
completely insane?

53:27.859 --> 53:29.801
Where did you hear that?

53:29.843 --> 53:31.698
A magazine.

53:31.732 --> 53:34.798
Um, well...

53:34.835 --> 53:37.257
Don't count on it.

53:37.300 --> 53:39.088
Okay.

53:43.091 --> 53:45.000
How about this one?

53:45.042 --> 53:46.286
Like it?

54:10.546 --> 54:12.782
You know what I like about you?

54:12.818 --> 54:15.500
Every time I think of you,
you appear.

54:20.849 --> 54:23.216
Listen, if you're not
rushing off to see a client...

54:23.248 --> 54:25.004
No.

54:25.041 --> 54:27.146
Not in this dress.

54:29.745 --> 54:31.271
Maybe we could have dinner
together.

54:31.344 --> 54:32.718
- Yes.
- Really?

54:32.752 --> 54:34.857
Yes. Yes.

54:36.336 --> 54:38.124
Okay.

54:38.160 --> 54:39.720
I'm just going to change, okay?

54:39.759 --> 54:40.839
Yeah.

54:40.879 --> 54:41.992
- Vicki?
- No.

54:42.031 --> 54:43.493
- Valerie?
- No.

54:43.536 --> 54:44.518
Virginia?

54:45.615 --> 54:46.760
West Virginia.

54:58.415 --> 54:59.658
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

54:59.695 --> 55:01.670
He's changing right now.

55:01.711 --> 55:02.888
I saw.

55:02.958 --> 55:04.518
He's ironing like crazy.

55:05.837 --> 55:07.364
What are you all dolled up for?

55:07.406 --> 55:08.485
I'm not.

55:08.526 --> 55:09.606
Are you coming with us?

55:09.646 --> 55:13.126
Gross! I have my own life,
thank you very much.

55:15.373 --> 55:17.413
Is that cologne
that you're wearing?

55:17.453 --> 55:18.533
No.

55:18.574 --> 55:19.850
Are you going on a date?

55:19.886 --> 55:22.340
Nah. Just practicing.

55:22.381 --> 55:23.396
What?

55:23.437 --> 55:25.160
Being cool,
in case I run into Stacy.

55:25.197 --> 55:26.604
Oh.

55:26.636 --> 55:28.807
Do you have something
to give her?

55:28.877 --> 55:30.186
Is that a rule?

55:31.500 --> 55:33.867
No, but it should be.

55:33.901 --> 55:37.196
I mean, girls and gifts...
it's kind of the same word.

55:37.229 --> 55:38.406
Here, give her this.

55:38.444 --> 55:39.491
I can't take this.

55:39.531 --> 55:41.222
Why not?

55:41.291 --> 55:43.331
I'm not giving this to anyone.

55:43.371 --> 55:45.313
I'll keep it with me always.

55:45.356 --> 55:46.697
Yeah?

55:46.732 --> 55:48.641
Thanks.

55:48.684 --> 55:50.593
You're welcome.

55:54.251 --> 55:57.480
I never had time to be lonely.

55:57.514 --> 55:59.587
You know, I had Frank
to take care of,

55:59.627 --> 56:01.766
and I guess I buried myself
in my work.

56:01.802 --> 56:05.380
Other than Frank, the wetlands
mean everything to me.

56:05.419 --> 56:06.913
Yeah.

56:08.682 --> 56:11.715
Oh, look, honey,
it's Frank's dad.

56:11.753 --> 56:13.641
I wonder who that woman is.

56:13.673 --> 56:15.495
She's a hooker.

56:17.161 --> 56:18.306
Honey...!

56:18.346 --> 56:20.801
I can't believe
I'm saying all this to you.

56:20.842 --> 56:21.889
Why?

56:21.930 --> 56:23.588
I'm normally not like this.

56:23.626 --> 56:25.633
I'm not at ease with new people.

56:25.674 --> 56:27.103
No? Neither am I.

56:27.146 --> 56:28.257
- Really?
- Yeah,

56:28.361 --> 56:30.565
and in my line of work,
that's a problem.

56:30.600 --> 56:32.226
Well, how
do you deal with it?

56:32.265 --> 56:33.759
Well, let's see.

56:33.801 --> 56:36.135
When I'm with someone new,

56:36.169 --> 56:39.714
I pretend like
I'm with someone that I love,

56:39.817 --> 56:42.534
and that helps me
get through it.

56:42.569 --> 56:44.161
Oh...!

56:45.863 --> 56:49.660
I don't think I've ever met
a more dedicated teacher.

56:51.400 --> 56:55.229
I don't think anyone's ever
looked at what I do that way.

56:55.272 --> 56:56.548
Well, why not?

56:56.584 --> 57:00.358
Just because you don't do it
in the classroom?

57:00.392 --> 57:02.660
You know, you're an amazing man.

57:08.103 --> 57:13.602
Right now... with me...

57:13.639 --> 57:14.752
What?

57:14.791 --> 57:15.871
Were you pretending?

57:15.911 --> 57:16.926
Pretending?

57:16.967 --> 57:19.584
That you're with someone else?

57:19.622 --> 57:21.116
Someone you love?

57:21.158 --> 57:25.249
No. I don't have to pretend
anything with you.

57:25.286 --> 57:29.115
Holly, isn't that
your little friend's dad?

57:29.157 --> 57:30.499
Yeah.

57:30.534 --> 57:31.744
I wonder who he's with?

57:31.782 --> 57:34.303
It's his sister.

57:34.342 --> 57:40.386
I, I feel a-a strong,
almost mammalian pull

57:40.421 --> 57:41.632
towards you.

57:43.173 --> 57:46.751
You mean like how the moon
pulls the tides?

57:46.788 --> 57:50.137
Yes. Yes, just like that.

57:50.181 --> 57:53.725
Are you sure you don't mean
his sister-in-law?

57:53.763 --> 57:56.065
No. It's his sister.

57:56.100 --> 57:57.725
Oh, well, I think that's sweet.

57:57.764 --> 57:59.869
They must be
a very affectionate family.

57:59.908 --> 58:01.915
You two could learn something
from them

58:01.956 --> 58:04.127
about just how close
a brother and sister

58:04.164 --> 58:06.074
can be.

58:06.116 --> 58:09.344
No one's ever said anything
like that to me before.

58:09.379 --> 58:10.361
Say it again.

58:10.403 --> 58:11.385
What?

58:11.427 --> 58:12.507
The mammal word.

58:12.547 --> 58:14.402
Mammalian.

58:14.435 --> 58:15.449
Yes, that's it.

58:16.643 --> 58:19.098
What does that mean?

58:19.139 --> 58:20.699
Mammals are
warm-blooded creatures.

58:20.739 --> 58:22.878
Warm?

58:22.914 --> 58:23.994
Very warm.

58:24.035 --> 58:25.081
Yes?

58:26.274 --> 58:27.648
Yes.

58:27.682 --> 58:30.103
Very, very warm?

58:40.034 --> 58:43.295
There's no way I'm doing that.

58:45.921 --> 58:48.823
- We should go.
- We should go.

58:48.865 --> 58:51.385
Um... where?

58:51.425 --> 58:54.207
Well, uh...
we're going to be late.

58:54.241 --> 58:55.964
Oh. Okay.

58:56.001 --> 58:57.408
We have reservations.

58:57.441 --> 58:58.901
Yeah.

59:05.440 --> 59:06.455
Tom.

59:06.496 --> 59:07.478
Judy.

59:07.520 --> 59:09.408
Hi.

59:09.472 --> 59:10.879
Kevin.

59:10.912 --> 59:12.122
V.

59:12.160 --> 59:14.070
You know this woman, son?

59:14.112 --> 59:15.736
Not as well as we know

59:15.775 --> 59:17.531
each other, Mr. Smith.

59:19.263 --> 59:22.558
You... know her, Father?

59:22.591 --> 59:24.184
Uh, no... no, no, no, no.

59:24.223 --> 59:27.736
No, you must be confusing me
with someone else.

59:27.775 --> 59:30.710
No, I may have the name wrong,
but I never forget a face.

59:30.751 --> 59:32.343
My name is V, like the letter.

59:32.382 --> 59:34.040
Your husband and I did business

59:34.078 --> 59:35.420
together once.

59:35.454 --> 59:38.138
Oh, yes, yes... of course.

59:38.174 --> 59:40.695
Yes, I'm sorry,
of course, yes.

59:40.734 --> 59:43.800
Uh, V is a, um...
a dance instructor.

59:43.838 --> 59:45.627
She, she taught me how to dance.

59:45.662 --> 59:47.931
Dance? You teach dance
and you tutor math?

59:47.966 --> 59:49.110
Isn't that wonderful?

59:49.149 --> 59:51.702
We should all go out dancing
together sometime.

59:51.741 --> 59:53.464
Oh, yes, let's do it soon.

59:53.501 --> 59:55.922
Maybe V could teach us
a couple of things.

59:55.965 --> 59:57.045
Uh, she can't.

59:57.085 --> 59:59.060
Um... she's retired.

59:59.101 --> 01:00:00.149
Listen,

01:00:00.189 --> 01:00:01.596
it was really nice to see you,

01:00:01.629 --> 01:00:03.058
but we've really got
to get going.

01:00:03.101 --> 01:00:04.824
Good to see you.

01:00:04.861 --> 01:00:06.519
Okay, bye-bye.

01:00:06.556 --> 01:00:09.905
Huh. It's a small...

01:00:09.948 --> 01:00:12.599
V.

01:00:12.636 --> 01:00:14.392
V.

01:00:19.196 --> 01:00:21.912
Stop it.
What are you doing?

01:00:21.948 --> 01:00:23.158
You said you fixed it.

01:00:23.195 --> 01:00:24.406
What's wrong with you?

01:00:24.444 --> 01:00:27.030
I thought things were different,
but I was wrong.

01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:28.693
- What happened?
- I have to go.

01:00:28.732 --> 01:00:29.812
I don't understand.

01:00:29.852 --> 01:00:31.739
I know...
that's why I have to go!

01:00:31.772 --> 01:00:32.982
Well, let me take you.

01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:35.638
Do you even know where I live?

01:00:35.675 --> 01:00:37.137
No, I don't; I have no idea.

01:00:37.179 --> 01:00:39.382
Do you want to see where I live?

01:00:39.418 --> 01:00:40.564
- Yeah.
- Follow me.

01:00:48.666 --> 01:00:51.569
Why are we climbing this tree?

01:00:58.330 --> 01:01:00.021
What, may I ask,
are you doing

01:01:00.058 --> 01:01:01.749
living in my son's tree house?

01:01:01.785 --> 01:01:04.720
Take off your pants;
then I'll tell you.

01:01:04.762 --> 01:01:06.322
Why do I have
to take off my pants?

01:01:06.362 --> 01:01:07.344
Because in my experience,

01:01:07.386 --> 01:01:09.688
men are better listeners
when they're not wearing pants,

01:01:09.721 --> 01:01:11.445
and I have something personal
to tell you,

01:01:11.482 --> 01:01:13.204
and I don't want you
to be able to get away.

01:01:13.241 --> 01:01:14.997
Okay.

01:01:15.032 --> 01:01:16.723
Fine.

01:01:16.761 --> 01:01:18.517
I'm taking off my pants.

01:01:18.553 --> 01:01:20.015
This better be good.

01:01:20.057 --> 01:01:22.708
Nobody's ever treated me
the way you treat me.

01:01:22.777 --> 01:01:23.987
How am I treating you?

01:01:24.024 --> 01:01:25.399
Like a person.

01:01:25.432 --> 01:01:27.320
How does everybody else
treat you?

01:01:27.352 --> 01:01:29.653
Like a hooker.

01:01:29.687 --> 01:01:31.957
W... W-W-Why would they do that?

01:01:31.992 --> 01:01:34.447
Because I am a hooker.

01:01:38.008 --> 01:01:40.594
W... What do you mean by that,
exactly?

01:01:40.632 --> 01:01:42.542
Frank told me he told you.

01:01:42.584 --> 01:01:43.729
What?

01:01:43.768 --> 01:01:44.978
I'm a prostitute.

01:01:45.016 --> 01:01:46.640
Men pay me
to have sex with them.

01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:48.849
Well, then, what, may I ask,
are you doing

01:01:48.887 --> 01:01:50.610
teaching math
to seventh graders?!

01:01:50.646 --> 01:01:52.272
I don't teach math.

01:01:52.310 --> 01:01:54.415
No, no, Frank told me
you were a math tutor.

01:01:54.455 --> 01:01:56.724
Well, he told me
that he told you I was a hooker,

01:01:56.758 --> 01:01:57.969
and that you didn't care.

01:01:58.007 --> 01:01:59.251
My son bought me a hooker?

01:01:59.286 --> 01:02:00.334
Give me back my pants.

01:02:00.375 --> 01:02:02.959
No, he didn't buy me for you!

01:02:03.029 --> 01:02:04.436
Oh, what a relief.

01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:05.844
He just wants me to marry you.

01:02:05.878 --> 01:02:07.536
You said I looked
like Grace Kelly.

01:02:07.573 --> 01:02:09.908
Who told you that?

01:02:09.941 --> 01:02:11.796
Frank. He probably lied
about that, too.

01:02:11.830 --> 01:02:15.441
No, he didn't. I...

01:02:15.542 --> 01:02:18.542
I did say that.

01:02:18.581 --> 01:02:20.173
You know,
I thought you were different.

01:02:20.213 --> 01:02:21.489
I thought
you were understanding.

01:02:21.525 --> 01:02:22.604
I am understanding.

01:02:22.645 --> 01:02:23.627
Boy, am I understanding.

01:02:23.669 --> 01:02:25.774
That would explain why
you looked at me that way.

01:02:25.812 --> 01:02:27.219
I looked at you that way

01:02:27.253 --> 01:02:29.228
because you looked at me
that way.

01:02:29.269 --> 01:02:30.283
What way?!

01:02:30.325 --> 01:02:32.332
Like I was somebody.

01:02:32.372 --> 01:02:33.387
Well, you are somebody.

01:02:33.429 --> 01:02:34.444
We're both somebodies.

01:02:34.485 --> 01:02:35.467
Let me out of here.

01:02:35.508 --> 01:02:36.784
How do you open this thing?

01:02:36.819 --> 01:02:38.608
I'm an adult somebody teacher,

01:02:38.643 --> 01:02:40.716
and you're
an adult somebody hooker

01:02:40.756 --> 01:02:42.414
that I'm supposed to marry.

01:02:46.579 --> 01:02:47.528
You should've told me.

01:02:47.572 --> 01:02:48.499
I tried to.

01:02:48.532 --> 01:02:49.710
You should've tried harder.

01:02:49.748 --> 01:02:50.795
Look, Dad, you always say

01:02:50.836 --> 01:02:52.526
it's not what you do,
it's who you are.

01:02:52.563 --> 01:02:53.773
But there's
a vast difference

01:02:53.843 --> 01:02:55.370
between being a math tutor...
Dad! Dad!

01:02:55.410 --> 01:02:56.523
There was no "but."

01:02:56.563 --> 01:02:57.905
I know you're trying
to help me.

01:02:57.938 --> 01:02:59.247
Ah, Dad, she's the right woman.

01:02:59.283 --> 01:03:00.625
Well, what's so right about her?

01:03:05.491 --> 01:03:07.051
I took a test in this magazine.

01:03:07.090 --> 01:03:08.978
"Are you Your Mate's
Perfect Woman?"

01:03:09.010 --> 01:03:10.187
She scores a 98

01:03:10.226 --> 01:03:13.183
out of a possible 100,
losing one point

01:03:13.471 --> 01:03:14.416
because she's a total stranger,

01:03:14.703 --> 01:03:16.127
and the other 'cause
your entire relationship

01:03:16.215 --> 01:03:17.174
is based on a lie.

01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:18.577
What, you only lose one point
for that?

01:03:18.610 --> 01:03:20.333
It says it's not very important.

01:03:20.369 --> 01:03:21.831
What could possibly be
more important?

01:03:21.874 --> 01:03:23.151
She's a grown-up, she has a job,

01:03:23.186 --> 01:03:24.909
she's independent,
she's good with money,

01:03:24.946 --> 01:03:27.498
she's funny, she
doesn't swear anymore...

01:03:27.537 --> 01:03:28.879
I talked to her about that...

01:03:28.912 --> 01:03:31.247
she watches cartoons,
and she likes ice cream,

01:03:31.281 --> 01:03:32.907
and she fits into Mom's clothes.

01:03:32.945 --> 01:03:35.945
I knew that dress
looked familiar.

01:03:35.984 --> 01:03:38.832
And she likes you, Dad...
that's the best part!

01:03:38.929 --> 01:03:41.230
Where did you learn
to be like this?

01:03:41.265 --> 01:03:42.726
From you.

01:04:07.887 --> 01:04:12.426
So...

01:04:12.462 --> 01:04:13.772
what does the magazine say?

01:04:13.807 --> 01:04:15.563
I mean, what am I supposed
to do now?

01:04:15.599 --> 01:04:17.801
Call her.

01:04:17.838 --> 01:04:20.140
On what?

01:04:28.558 --> 01:04:29.638
V?

01:04:31.694 --> 01:04:32.806
V?

01:04:35.917 --> 01:04:38.088
She's not picking up.

01:04:39.277 --> 01:04:40.619
V?!

01:04:43.181 --> 01:04:44.522
Oh!

01:04:44.557 --> 01:04:46.793
Geez!

01:04:55.596 --> 01:04:57.484
V, don't go.

01:04:57.516 --> 01:04:59.971
I thought that you were
my friend,

01:05:00.012 --> 01:05:02.313
but you're not...
you're a liar.

01:05:09.995 --> 01:05:10.923
Wait a minute.

01:05:10.955 --> 01:05:11.883
I want to talk to you.

01:05:11.915 --> 01:05:12.843
Stay away from me.

01:05:12.875 --> 01:05:14.217
I'm the one who should be angry.

01:05:14.251 --> 01:05:15.330
I'm the one who was deceived.

01:05:15.371 --> 01:05:16.451
I am not angry.

01:05:16.491 --> 01:05:18.433
I just want to get
out of here.

01:05:18.475 --> 01:05:20.133
I don't like the suburbs.

01:05:20.171 --> 01:05:22.375
Car doesn't work.

01:05:22.411 --> 01:05:23.337
Keep it.

01:05:23.370 --> 01:05:24.647
It isn't mine anyway.

01:06:11.528 --> 01:06:14.211
Diaphragm.

01:06:17.831 --> 01:06:20.581
It's a locket.

01:06:20.615 --> 01:06:23.517
Somebody's empty locket.

01:06:23.559 --> 01:06:26.429
That's kind of sad.

01:06:27.431 --> 01:06:29.187
It's my locket.

01:06:29.224 --> 01:06:31.262
I gave it to him.

01:06:31.302 --> 01:06:34.084
He said he would keep it
forever.

01:06:41.958 --> 01:06:44.892
It's a picture of his mom.

01:06:49.509 --> 01:06:52.738
I didn't even know he had this.

01:06:53.733 --> 01:06:57.988
She didn't look at all
like Grace Kelly.

01:06:58.022 --> 01:07:00.989
Neither do I, for that matter.

01:07:01.029 --> 01:07:03.516
You do to me.

01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:16.446
I don't want to have sex
with you, you know.

01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:21.532
I don't want to have sex
with you, either.

01:07:23.491 --> 01:07:27.746
I never really thought that she
looked like Grace Kelly.

01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:32.864
It was just the quality
that she had... a feeling.

01:07:32.899 --> 01:07:35.899
And then it became a game
with Frank and me...

01:07:35.939 --> 01:07:38.972
who did and didn't have that...
this quality.

01:07:39.010 --> 01:07:42.807
It was so hard for me
to talk about her.

01:07:44.898 --> 01:07:49.306
It was the only way I could let
Frank know... about her.

01:07:50.306 --> 01:07:52.063
Tell me how you met.

01:07:52.162 --> 01:07:54.943
We knew each other
in high school, and...

01:07:54.977 --> 01:07:57.497
actually,
it was junior high school.

01:07:57.538 --> 01:08:01.247
I remember the first time
I saw her.

01:08:02.241 --> 01:08:04.412
Yeah?

01:08:05.857 --> 01:08:07.613
She was leaning
on the kitchen counter

01:08:07.649 --> 01:08:09.951
talking on the telephone.

01:08:12.512 --> 01:08:14.716
We were at a dance.

01:08:14.752 --> 01:08:16.956
A dance?

01:08:16.992 --> 01:08:19.992
I never went to a dance.

01:08:20.032 --> 01:08:22.879
Why not?

01:08:22.912 --> 01:08:26.076
'Cause I left home
when I was 14.

01:08:27.071 --> 01:08:30.268
I missed my whole life.

01:08:42.975 --> 01:08:47.349
If I'm the first, you know,
this might hurt a bit.

01:08:48.350 --> 01:08:50.554
You trying to be funny?

01:08:50.590 --> 01:08:54.234
I'm not talking about sex.

01:08:54.270 --> 01:08:57.532
What are you talking about?

01:08:57.566 --> 01:09:00.020
I want to make love with you.

01:09:28.381 --> 01:09:31.130
Eve, Eve...

01:09:31.163 --> 01:09:33.531
Eve's my middle name.

01:09:33.564 --> 01:09:35.221
And, I...

01:09:35.259 --> 01:09:39.602
I changed it because it
just sounded too Biblical,

01:09:39.644 --> 01:09:43.256
so I took off the Es.

01:09:46.523 --> 01:09:48.759
This hurts.

01:10:28.409 --> 01:10:30.296
Damn it!

01:10:42.937 --> 01:10:45.075
Yes, hello.

01:10:45.113 --> 01:10:49.553
Did you have somebody
in mind, sir?

01:10:49.592 --> 01:10:51.153
I have someone in mind.

01:10:51.192 --> 01:10:52.174
Her name is V.

01:10:52.216 --> 01:10:53.296
V?

01:10:53.336 --> 01:10:56.336
We don't know where she-she is.

01:10:56.377 --> 01:10:58.743
That's bullshit!

01:10:58.775 --> 01:11:00.302
That's bullshit.

01:11:00.343 --> 01:11:02.253
Oh, I saw her tonight,
in Middleton.

01:11:02.296 --> 01:11:03.637
You saw her in Middleton?

01:11:03.671 --> 01:11:04.751
Middleton?

01:11:04.791 --> 01:11:05.936
What address?

01:11:08.152 --> 01:11:10.519
He-he hung up.

01:11:10.584 --> 01:11:11.631
Of course.

01:11:11.671 --> 01:11:12.751
He hung up.

01:11:12.791 --> 01:11:14.514
Well, she shouldn't be
too hard to find.

01:11:43.574 --> 01:11:46.029
Good morning, Frank.
Good morning, Frank.

01:11:46.133 --> 01:11:47.628
Did I miss something?

01:11:47.670 --> 01:11:48.749
You sure did.

01:11:48.788 --> 01:11:50.162
V and I have been
in the wetlands

01:11:50.197 --> 01:11:51.473
collecting samples since dawn.

01:11:51.509 --> 01:11:53.069
Excuse me,
I have to get something

01:11:53.109 --> 01:11:54.538
out of the garbage.

01:12:05.204 --> 01:12:07.790
You looking for this?

01:12:10.675 --> 01:12:12.683
I'm sorry I lied.

01:12:12.724 --> 01:12:15.658
But you said the truth
gets you in trouble.

01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:17.423
Yeah.

01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:18.921
Are you staying?

01:12:18.963 --> 01:12:20.786
For a while.

01:12:20.819 --> 01:12:22.444
As my mom?

01:12:22.515 --> 01:12:25.198
No, not as your mom.

01:12:25.234 --> 01:12:26.893
Well, then, as what?

01:12:26.931 --> 01:12:31.666
Um... as a friend of the family.

01:12:31.698 --> 01:12:33.521
That'll do.

01:12:33.554 --> 01:12:35.725
Good. Come on.

01:12:35.763 --> 01:12:38.151
There's just one more thing.

01:12:45.202 --> 01:12:48.202
Okay, now, I want you
to just watch my feet,

01:12:48.242 --> 01:12:50.959
and listen to the music, okay?

01:12:54.098 --> 01:12:55.024
See?

01:12:55.057 --> 01:12:56.464
Now, you try.

01:12:56.496 --> 01:12:58.831
Move your feet.

01:12:59.824 --> 01:13:01.613
I said move your feet, Frank.

01:13:01.648 --> 01:13:04.070
I am moving my feet.

01:13:04.113 --> 01:13:05.575
Okay.

01:13:05.617 --> 01:13:07.504
New deal.

01:13:07.537 --> 01:13:09.260
Um...

01:13:09.297 --> 01:13:12.263
Don't move your feet, okay?

01:13:12.303 --> 01:13:14.856
Just sort of sway your hips
from side to side.

01:13:14.896 --> 01:13:16.554
I don't want to move my hips...

01:13:16.592 --> 01:13:17.486
that's how it all starts.

01:13:17.519 --> 01:13:18.447
What?

01:13:18.479 --> 01:13:19.657
Sex.

01:13:19.695 --> 01:13:21.124
I've decided
it's an evil scheme.

01:13:21.168 --> 01:13:22.990
Well, what can you do
with your body?

01:13:23.023 --> 01:13:24.878
I mean, something
where you have to...

01:13:24.912 --> 01:13:27.846
touch somebody else
and move at the same time.

01:13:29.807 --> 01:13:31.781
I... I can thumb wrestle.

01:13:31.823 --> 01:13:33.066
Okay.
That's good.

01:13:33.103 --> 01:13:34.826
All right, that's a start.

01:13:34.863 --> 01:13:36.935
Better watch out...
I'm pretty good.

01:13:36.975 --> 01:13:39.430
One, two, three, four.

01:13:39.471 --> 01:13:41.064
Now we start the thumb war.

01:13:50.414 --> 01:13:51.396
Got you.

01:13:51.438 --> 01:13:52.299
- No, you didn't.
- Got you.

01:13:59.054 --> 01:14:00.330
Come on.

01:14:00.366 --> 01:14:02.307
Yeah!

01:14:04.685 --> 01:14:05.994
Frank?

01:14:07.276 --> 01:14:08.072
Frank.

01:14:08.109 --> 01:14:09.036
Yeah?

01:14:09.069 --> 01:14:10.563
You're dancing.

01:14:10.605 --> 01:14:13.223
You're dancing, dude.

01:14:17.709 --> 01:14:18.635
Good morning.

01:14:18.668 --> 01:14:20.075
Good morning.

01:14:20.107 --> 01:14:21.155
Nice day, isn't it?

01:14:30.284 --> 01:14:32.553
Sour cream and onion.

01:14:32.587 --> 01:14:33.994
Popsicles?

01:14:34.028 --> 01:14:35.587
Sure.

01:14:35.627 --> 01:14:36.706
Pretzels?

01:14:36.747 --> 01:14:38.154
Yeah.

01:14:38.187 --> 01:14:40.097
Oh, Fluff.

01:14:42.059 --> 01:14:43.946
Hi. How are you?

01:14:43.979 --> 01:14:45.288
Great.

01:15:02.890 --> 01:15:04.003
Excuse me, ma'am.

01:15:04.042 --> 01:15:05.733
Have you seen this woman?

01:15:05.770 --> 01:15:06.817
It's important.

01:15:09.289 --> 01:15:11.460
Well, take your time.
I've got all day.

01:15:11.497 --> 01:15:12.445
No...

01:15:12.489 --> 01:15:14.213
I can't say as I have.

01:15:14.249 --> 01:15:16.136
Sorry.

01:15:23.017 --> 01:15:24.926
I beg your pardon...

01:15:24.969 --> 01:15:27.903
Mom? Can I have
the new Cosmo, please?

01:15:29.256 --> 01:15:31.590
My mom... she's the greatest.

01:15:46.854 --> 01:15:48.131
Where are we going so fast?

01:15:48.166 --> 01:15:49.094
You're going home.

01:15:49.126 --> 01:15:51.068
I'm taking the fastest
way out of here.

01:15:51.111 --> 01:15:52.736
But he didn't even
recognize you.

01:15:52.775 --> 01:15:55.011
For all he knows,
you're a million miles away.

01:15:55.047 --> 01:15:56.956
He doesn't know my dad
can't fix cars.

01:15:56.999 --> 01:15:59.333
I'm not staying, Frank.

01:16:04.934 --> 01:16:06.756
So, this is what it's like.

01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:08.000
What do you mean?

01:16:08.038 --> 01:16:10.623
To have a mom.

01:16:19.237 --> 01:16:21.147
You look cool, Frank.

01:16:21.189 --> 01:16:23.360
You look very, very cool.

01:16:24.581 --> 01:16:27.647
And tonight,
Stacy's going to think

01:16:27.685 --> 01:16:29.856
you look very cool, too.

01:16:29.925 --> 01:16:32.128
V, don't go.

01:18:22.302 --> 01:18:23.895
It's going to be fun.
Come on.

01:18:27.902 --> 01:18:29.789
Oh, shit!

01:18:29.821 --> 01:18:31.709
Frank! V!

01:18:31.805 --> 01:18:35.002
Frank! V!

01:18:35.037 --> 01:18:37.404
I found out what's wrong
with the car!

01:18:37.437 --> 01:18:39.193
Frank!

01:18:39.229 --> 01:18:41.334
Frank? V?

01:18:42.781 --> 01:18:43.893
Frank?

01:18:43.933 --> 01:18:47.380
Where is everybody?

01:20:33.464 --> 01:20:35.024
What happened to you?

01:20:35.063 --> 01:20:37.518
I stopped washing...
completely.

01:20:40.792 --> 01:20:42.002
You smell.

01:20:42.039 --> 01:20:44.340
I will no longer be
my father's dupe.

01:20:44.375 --> 01:20:46.382
You don't look so good yourself.

01:20:46.422 --> 01:20:47.404
What's up?

01:20:47.446 --> 01:20:48.875
Lots of things.

01:20:48.918 --> 01:20:51.285
I mean, Stacy loves Brad,

01:20:51.318 --> 01:20:52.878
which makes me feel
like I can't breathe.

01:20:55.158 --> 01:20:56.881
It'd be different
if V were here.

01:20:56.918 --> 01:21:00.397
Really?

01:21:00.437 --> 01:21:01.779
Think so, huh?

01:21:01.814 --> 01:21:04.115
And what would you do
if V were here?

01:21:04.149 --> 01:21:06.353
I'd ask her to dance.

01:21:06.389 --> 01:21:09.171
Prove it.

01:21:26.068 --> 01:21:28.140
Frank.

01:21:28.244 --> 01:21:30.732
Couldn't leave
without saying good-bye.

01:21:30.772 --> 01:21:32.365
Would you like to dance?

01:21:32.404 --> 01:21:33.832
I thought you didn't know how.

01:21:33.907 --> 01:21:35.314
I don't.

01:21:35.348 --> 01:21:37.584
Well, what do you do at a dance
if you can't dance?

01:21:38.803 --> 01:21:40.363
I thumb wrestle.

01:21:47.699 --> 01:21:49.073
- Look, sweetie.
- Huh?

01:21:49.107 --> 01:21:50.731
It's your dance instructor.

01:21:50.771 --> 01:21:51.818
Oh...

01:22:00.594 --> 01:22:02.155
Oh, yes!

01:22:19.601 --> 01:22:21.740
She's very good, isn't she?

01:22:21.778 --> 01:22:23.882
Yes. Yes.

01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:26.822
Oh, yes.

01:22:33.713 --> 01:22:35.371
He can dance.

01:22:35.408 --> 01:22:38.791
He can dance really well.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.047
She's a math tutor.

01:22:43.087 --> 01:22:45.226
Can she solve
multivariable equations?

01:22:45.263 --> 01:22:47.402
What are the odds of finding
another woman with that body

01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:49.709
and those skills?

01:23:23.886 --> 01:23:25.544
Here comes my jacket.

01:23:25.581 --> 01:23:27.174
I think he likes you.

01:23:27.214 --> 01:23:28.643
Think he does?

01:23:28.686 --> 01:23:31.947
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:34.850
Would you like this?

01:23:43.437 --> 01:23:45.095
Would you like to dance?

01:23:58.059 --> 01:23:59.815
Did I miss something?

01:24:15.434 --> 01:24:18.663
Mine.

01:24:23.594 --> 01:24:24.641
Wait right here.

01:24:24.681 --> 01:24:26.786
- Wait, wait, Robert.
- Don't move.

01:24:26.826 --> 01:24:29.543
What are you, what are you
going to do?

01:24:29.577 --> 01:24:33.571
I'm going to the sock hop...
whatever that is.

01:24:33.610 --> 01:24:37.222
I have something important
to tell you.

01:24:37.257 --> 01:24:41.315
You don't want me to leave?

01:24:41.352 --> 01:24:44.352
Right, I don't want you
to leave, but...

01:24:44.393 --> 01:24:46.302
there's something else, too.

01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:49.825
You've got a lot of nerve

01:24:49.865 --> 01:24:51.937
bringing a slut like this
into our school.

01:25:02.696 --> 01:25:04.419
You turned my son into a pig.

01:25:05.992 --> 01:25:06.919
Yeah, but he's a...

01:25:06.952 --> 01:25:07.879
...happy

01:25:07.912 --> 01:25:08.839
...pig.

01:25:08.872 --> 01:25:10.759
There are children here.

01:25:10.792 --> 01:25:13.474
There are children here!

01:25:13.511 --> 01:25:16.064
Fight, fight, fight...

01:25:19.494 --> 01:25:21.731
I'm happy to see you, V.

01:25:22.759 --> 01:25:24.831
Yeah. It's a real gun.

01:25:24.871 --> 01:25:25.798
Hey! Hey-hey-hey.

01:25:25.831 --> 01:25:27.391
Come on, come on.

01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:28.739
I'd ask you to dance, but...

01:25:28.774 --> 01:25:31.141
seems you got the last geezer
in a bit of trouble.

01:25:39.782 --> 01:25:42.116
You thought you could take
my money and get away with it?

01:25:42.150 --> 01:25:43.938
Well, my little bluebird,
you thought wrong.

01:25:43.974 --> 01:25:45.249
You know I wouldn't steal
from you, Waltzer.

01:25:45.285 --> 01:25:46.233
Oh?

01:25:51.589 --> 01:25:52.571
Waltzer...

01:25:52.613 --> 01:25:53.823
You think I'm stupid,
is that it?

01:25:53.861 --> 01:25:55.071
- No.
- I know the whole story.

01:25:55.108 --> 01:25:56.221
Cash steals from me.

01:25:56.261 --> 01:25:58.847
He hides $250,000
in the gas tank of his car.

01:25:58.885 --> 01:25:59.867
I hated Cash.

01:25:59.908 --> 01:26:01.151
You stole his car,
and then it's my money

01:26:01.188 --> 01:26:02.365
that's paying
for your nice little life

01:26:02.468 --> 01:26:03.777
- in the suburbs.
- No, I wouldn't do that.

01:26:03.812 --> 01:26:04.859
I wouldn't do
anything like that.

01:26:04.900 --> 01:26:05.980
Oh, yeah?

01:26:06.019 --> 01:26:07.001
- Give me your best shot.
- Really?

01:26:07.044 --> 01:26:08.091
- Give me your best shot.
- Yeah?

01:26:13.732 --> 01:26:15.707
Now, here's the best part.

01:26:15.748 --> 01:26:18.114
Are you listening?
Get this, Cloth Ears.

01:26:18.146 --> 01:26:19.969
One: I kill Cash,
I kill you...

01:26:20.003 --> 01:26:21.345
I get my money back.

01:26:21.378 --> 01:26:22.306
All right?

01:26:22.338 --> 01:26:23.582
I love happy endings.

01:26:23.619 --> 01:26:24.928
Wait a minute...
there's money in the car?

01:26:24.963 --> 01:26:27.484
"Wait a minute...
there's money in the..."

01:26:27.523 --> 01:26:29.083
It's still there.

01:26:37.634 --> 01:26:38.844
Come on, come on!

01:26:38.882 --> 01:26:39.896
What? What?

01:26:39.938 --> 01:26:41.050
Hey, Mister,
I know a shortcut.

01:26:41.089 --> 01:26:42.017
Fire?

01:26:42.049 --> 01:26:44.221
I don't like fire!

01:26:44.258 --> 01:26:46.811
Come on, this way,
over here, come on!

01:26:46.849 --> 01:26:48.093
Thanks, Sonny Jim.

01:26:48.130 --> 01:26:50.912
Oh, my God...
it's a closet.

01:26:50.946 --> 01:26:52.057
Yes!

01:26:52.096 --> 01:26:54.136
I don't like closets!

01:26:54.177 --> 01:26:56.413
It's dark in here!

01:27:01.057 --> 01:27:01.983
Come on!

01:27:01.121 --> 01:27:02.910
Come on!

01:27:08.928 --> 01:27:10.422
- There it is... let's go!
- Okay.

01:27:13.055 --> 01:27:15.422
Little bastards.

01:27:15.456 --> 01:27:17.212
Who's driving?

01:27:18.528 --> 01:27:21.277
Frank! Frank, you let me drive.

01:27:21.312 --> 01:27:23.581
Let's go!

01:27:24.830 --> 01:27:26.041
Yes!

01:27:26.079 --> 01:27:27.573
There's no bloody fire!

01:27:27.614 --> 01:27:29.076
Get out the bloody way!

01:27:29.118 --> 01:27:30.296
There's no fire...

01:27:36.254 --> 01:27:38.077
Get out... come on,
get out the bloody way.

01:27:38.110 --> 01:27:39.059
Get out of the way!

01:27:42.238 --> 01:27:45.271
What the bloody hell
happened, huh?!

01:27:45.310 --> 01:27:48.823
Well... some very small
person took the car,

01:27:48.862 --> 01:27:50.902
but I broke a nail, which is...

01:27:50.941 --> 01:27:51.890
Broke a nail?

01:27:51.934 --> 01:27:53.559
I'll break your bloody neck.

01:27:53.598 --> 01:27:54.710
Get in there.

01:27:54.749 --> 01:27:56.342
You're not even worth
the price of a bullet.

01:27:56.382 --> 01:27:57.691
Oh, yes, I am.

01:27:57.725 --> 01:27:59.219
Oh, no, you're not!

01:27:59.261 --> 01:28:00.854
Oh, yes, I am.

01:28:02.972 --> 01:28:03.921
You're not.

01:28:03.965 --> 01:28:04.913
Am, too!

01:28:04.957 --> 01:28:05.905
Not!

01:28:05.948 --> 01:28:06.897
Am, too!

01:28:06.941 --> 01:28:08.283
Shut up! You're not!

01:28:11.452 --> 01:28:12.499
Slow down!

01:28:12.541 --> 01:28:13.523
I can't reach
the pedals

01:28:13.565 --> 01:28:14.938
and steer at the same time!

01:28:14.972 --> 01:28:16.182
I've got some major
cruise control

01:28:16.220 --> 01:28:17.048
going here!

01:28:17.084 --> 01:28:18.906
All right, you steer,
I'll do pedals.

01:28:18.939 --> 01:28:19.867
Good idea!

01:28:19.899 --> 01:28:21.722
No, bad idea.
Let me drive!

01:28:21.756 --> 01:28:23.927
You can't drive from
the back seat... it's illegal!

01:28:23.964 --> 01:28:25.044
Look out, look out!

01:28:29.499 --> 01:28:30.961
Oh, oh...

01:28:31.003 --> 01:28:32.246
This is the sidewalk!

01:28:32.282 --> 01:28:33.624
Sidewalk?

01:28:35.610 --> 01:28:36.690
Oh, people!

01:28:42.491 --> 01:28:43.603
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

01:28:43.642 --> 01:28:44.984
That was part of the car!

01:28:45.019 --> 01:28:46.131
Brake! Brake!

01:28:46.170 --> 01:28:47.545
Gas!

01:28:48.570 --> 01:28:49.999
Brake.

01:28:50.042 --> 01:28:51.765
Gas! Gas... he's coming!

01:28:53.593 --> 01:28:56.081
Oh, my God! Jesus!

01:28:57.081 --> 01:28:58.423
Here comes the pimp-mobile.

01:28:58.458 --> 01:28:59.221
Brake!

01:28:59.257 --> 01:29:00.719
Gas, gas!

01:29:12.313 --> 01:29:14.036
All right!
I see it, I see it!

01:29:20.953 --> 01:29:22.512
Wait, left!

01:29:22.552 --> 01:29:24.374
Um, um, um, um...

01:29:24.407 --> 01:29:25.487
- Right!
- No, left!

01:29:28.568 --> 01:29:29.014
Left!

01:29:31.127 --> 01:29:33.615
You know that thing on the car...
well, it's gone.

01:29:33.655 --> 01:29:35.216
Do we need it?

01:29:37.336 --> 01:29:38.961
Let me drive!

01:29:40.247 --> 01:29:41.708
You broke the car!

01:29:41.751 --> 01:29:42.481
Go right!

01:29:44.118 --> 01:29:45.679
You lost the steering wheel?

01:29:46.998 --> 01:29:48.405
Who's smoking?

01:29:48.439 --> 01:29:49.617
It's the car!

01:29:55.830 --> 01:29:58.034
That mad, frigging tart!

01:29:59.925 --> 01:30:01.681
Sounds like a train.

01:30:01.718 --> 01:30:03.212
I think it is a train.

01:30:03.254 --> 01:30:04.978
Well, what's it doing?

01:30:06.486 --> 01:30:07.501
Oh, nothing.

01:30:07.542 --> 01:30:08.720
Oh, my God!

01:30:10.293 --> 01:30:11.537
Brake! We'll never make it!

01:30:11.574 --> 01:30:13.842
No, go, go!

01:30:13.876 --> 01:30:15.087
We'll make it! Faster!

01:30:15.125 --> 01:30:16.074
Brake!

01:30:16.117 --> 01:30:17.546
Make up your minds!

01:30:20.181 --> 01:30:21.643
All right, all right!

01:30:22.709 --> 01:30:23.603
Brake!

01:30:23.637 --> 01:30:24.619
Gas!

01:30:26.196 --> 01:30:27.440
Oh, my God!

01:30:37.524 --> 01:30:38.451
What happened?

01:30:38.484 --> 01:30:39.247
Fire!

01:30:39.283 --> 01:30:40.047
She's going to blow!

01:30:40.755 --> 01:30:41.868
It's a fire. Get out!

01:30:41.908 --> 01:30:43.283
Get out!

01:30:45.555 --> 01:30:46.864
You big jerk!

01:30:46.899 --> 01:30:48.273
You could have killed me.

01:30:49.811 --> 01:30:51.567
Jesus...

01:30:51.603 --> 01:30:53.196
She's going to blow!

01:30:55.571 --> 01:30:56.651
Get away!

01:30:56.691 --> 01:30:57.519
Come on, get out, Frank.

01:30:57.555 --> 01:31:00.370
Pull, pull!
Get him out!

01:31:00.402 --> 01:31:01.166
Get him out of here!

01:31:01.203 --> 01:31:03.275
Get him out!

01:31:21.233 --> 01:31:24.746
They're children, you big dope!

01:31:35.601 --> 01:31:38.731
Oh, God... they blew up

01:31:38.768 --> 01:31:40.840
my bloody money!

01:31:42.512 --> 01:31:44.006
When I find her

01:31:44.048 --> 01:31:46.863
I'm going to rip her face off
and put it in a jar.

01:31:46.896 --> 01:31:48.106
Get in the car!

01:31:48.144 --> 01:31:49.355
Shut up.

01:31:49.392 --> 01:31:51.465
Just get in there!

01:31:51.504 --> 01:31:54.350
Oh, she's gone,
Waltzer, she's gone.

01:31:54.383 --> 01:31:57.285
Oh, shut up.
Cork your bloody beak.

01:32:10.606 --> 01:32:11.719
Frank!

01:32:11.758 --> 01:32:12.805
Dad, Dad!

01:32:12.846 --> 01:32:14.253
Oh!

01:32:18.862 --> 01:32:19.844
You okay?

01:32:19.886 --> 01:32:21.096
Yeah.

01:32:21.134 --> 01:32:22.247
We blew up the car.

01:32:24.782 --> 01:32:26.668
You boys all right?

01:32:26.701 --> 01:32:28.359
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:32:28.397 --> 01:32:30.601
Was V with you?

01:32:30.637 --> 01:32:31.814
Well, yeah, she was with us.

01:32:31.853 --> 01:32:32.780
Did she get out?

01:32:32.813 --> 01:32:34.219
Well, yeah, she got out,
and then...

01:32:34.253 --> 01:32:35.463
I don't know what happened.

01:32:35.501 --> 01:32:36.515
Well, where is she?

01:32:36.621 --> 01:32:37.701
Where is she?

01:32:37.741 --> 01:32:38.756
Dad!

01:32:38.797 --> 01:32:41.480
Dad, she's gone.

01:32:47.724 --> 01:32:50.091
She's gone, Dad.

01:33:25.770 --> 01:33:27.330
This way.

01:33:27.370 --> 01:33:28.581
Thank you.

01:33:38.313 --> 01:33:40.200
I want out.

01:33:50.568 --> 01:33:53.983
You'd be taking money
out of my pocket.

01:33:54.024 --> 01:33:57.058
Waltzer's taken out a lot more
than I ever put in.

01:33:57.096 --> 01:34:00.641
I'm saving you a fortune, Jerry.

01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:03.069
I mean, let me go, please.

01:34:08.199 --> 01:34:09.628
Good-bye, my child.

01:34:09.671 --> 01:34:11.711
Thank you.

01:34:14.919 --> 01:34:18.148
What about Waltzer?

01:34:18.183 --> 01:34:21.925
After today,
Waltzer doesn't exist anymore.

01:36:10.176 --> 01:36:12.249
Oh, my God!

01:36:13.792 --> 01:36:16.061
Oh, my God!

01:36:42.398 --> 01:36:43.740
Nice chains, Mr. Wheeler.

01:36:43.774 --> 01:36:45.465
My dad's in therapy,
Mr. Wheeler.

01:36:45.502 --> 01:36:46.451
Thanks.

01:36:46.494 --> 01:36:47.836
Dad, please, you lost.

01:36:47.934 --> 01:36:49.973
You chained yourself
to the truck two days ago,

01:36:50.014 --> 01:36:51.770
and the local paper
didn't even show up.

01:36:51.806 --> 01:36:55.122
Tom, you unchain yourself,
nobody's pressing charges.

01:36:55.165 --> 01:36:56.375
Please, Dad.

01:36:56.413 --> 01:36:59.097
We have to cut you free,
you're going to jail.

01:36:59.133 --> 01:37:00.180
Dad!

01:37:00.221 --> 01:37:04.312
When this place goes,
a part of me goes with it...

01:37:04.349 --> 01:37:07.928
a part of all of us.

01:37:08.029 --> 01:37:11.127
I'll go to jail.

01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:16.722
Okay, we're ready to go.

01:37:16.764 --> 01:37:19.764
Tom, you're under arrest.

01:37:19.804 --> 01:37:20.786
Dad!

01:37:20.828 --> 01:37:22.202
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:37:22.236 --> 01:37:24.146
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

01:37:24.188 --> 01:37:26.043
in a court of law.

01:37:27.899 --> 01:37:29.873
If you so desire and
cannot afford one,

01:37:29.916 --> 01:37:31.858
an attorney will be
appointed for you

01:37:31.899 --> 01:37:33.175
without charge
before questioning.

01:37:33.211 --> 01:37:34.705
Do you understand
each of these rights?

01:37:34.747 --> 01:37:35.576
Forget it, Charlie.

01:37:35.611 --> 01:37:36.539
He's got the right to do

01:37:36.571 --> 01:37:38.906
any damn thing he pleases.

01:37:38.939 --> 01:37:40.597
What's going on here?

01:37:45.466 --> 01:37:47.059
What is that?

01:37:47.098 --> 01:37:48.985
A deed.

01:37:49.018 --> 01:37:53.807
It's a deed to the wetlands
in my name.

01:37:53.850 --> 01:37:55.279
What...

01:37:55.322 --> 01:37:59.348
Somebody bought the Tonapaya
Wetlands in my name.

01:37:59.386 --> 01:38:00.530
Who did this?

01:38:01.561 --> 01:38:04.179
She did it.

01:38:05.529 --> 01:38:06.577
V!

01:38:06.617 --> 01:38:09.300
Oh, V!

01:38:11.705 --> 01:38:13.134
Tom, I'm happy for you.

01:38:13.177 --> 01:38:15.894
All right, boys,
let's pack it in and go home.

01:38:15.929 --> 01:38:16.944
You go home, Tiny.

01:38:21.688 --> 01:38:24.470
Does this mean you're staying?

01:38:25.945 --> 01:38:27.767
Come on,
I have to talk to your dad.

01:38:30.008 --> 01:38:31.088
Oh, wow.

01:38:31.128 --> 01:38:33.299
This is so cool.

01:38:33.368 --> 01:38:37.142
Well, you guys take care
of yourselves.

01:38:37.175 --> 01:38:38.768
Yeah, yeah.

01:38:38.807 --> 01:38:40.149
Yeah, yeah.

01:38:46.712 --> 01:38:48.021
It was your money, you know.

01:38:48.055 --> 01:38:49.713
You should've
spent it on yourself.

01:38:49.751 --> 01:38:51.790
I did. I bought a few things.

01:38:53.175 --> 01:38:55.062
This was for you and me.

01:38:55.095 --> 01:38:57.615
Glossy ibis has to have a home.

01:38:57.654 --> 01:38:59.542
Thanks.

01:39:01.622 --> 01:39:04.175
Tell me I'm worth waiting for.

01:39:04.214 --> 01:39:07.061
You're worth much more
than that.

01:39:25.492 --> 01:39:27.183
Well, where are you going?

01:39:27.220 --> 01:39:28.846
How will we find you?

01:39:28.884 --> 01:39:32.016
You know that ice cream parlor?

01:39:32.052 --> 01:39:32.980
Yeah.

01:39:33.012 --> 01:39:35.434
You know, the one where
you first kissed me?

01:39:35.476 --> 01:39:37.265
Yeah.

01:39:37.300 --> 01:39:39.755
I bought it.

01:39:41.203 --> 01:39:42.545
You're staying here?

01:39:42.580 --> 01:39:43.562
Uh-huh.

01:39:43.603 --> 01:39:44.813
Here?

01:39:44.851 --> 01:39:47.218
You know what?

01:39:47.251 --> 01:39:51.244
There is a place you can touch
a woman that'll drive her crazy.

01:39:51.283 --> 01:39:52.657
Where?

01:39:54.067 --> 01:39:55.922
Her heart.

01:40:05.554 --> 01:40:06.983
See you.

01:40:17.873 --> 01:40:19.531
I have a hair.

01:40:22.673 --> 01:40:24.495
I have a hair!
