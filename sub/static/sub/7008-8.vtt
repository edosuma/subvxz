00:04.270 --> 00:05.738
Welcome to <i>Tool
Time on location.</i>

00:05.805 --> 00:07.805
Today we're coming to you
from Hernando's Junkyard.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.875
Thank you, Heidi.

00:09.943 --> 00:14.446
Well, right now I'm standing next
to a pile of old, useless debris.

00:14.513 --> 00:17.783
And of course there's the rest
of the stuff in the junkyard.

00:17.851 --> 00:20.385
Now, most of us will probably
go through our entire lives

00:20.453 --> 00:22.821
without ever visiting
an auto-salvage yard.

00:22.889 --> 00:24.589
I, for one, as a
child spent hours

00:24.657 --> 00:25.937
frolicking through this junkyard

00:25.992 --> 00:27.893
next to all these old,
rusted hulks.

00:27.961 --> 00:30.763
The noxious chemicals,
the pools of Freon and oil.

00:32.398 --> 00:34.299
That explains so much.

00:34.367 --> 00:35.700
But not anymore.

00:35.769 --> 00:37.941
The revered junkyard's no longer
a hip, happening place to be.

00:37.971 --> 00:40.172
Kids today have malls to go to.

00:40.240 --> 00:42.241
Do you suppose they
call it a junkyard

00:42.308 --> 00:44.380
because this is where the Chinese
people keep their old vessels?

00:44.410 --> 00:47.479
"That one's got a big hole in it!
Move it to the back!"

00:47.546 --> 00:49.047
I don't think so, Tim.

00:49.115 --> 00:51.221
And to guide us through this
boulevard of broken dreams is

00:51.251 --> 00:54.086
the owner of Hernando's, Larry.

00:54.154 --> 00:56.221
- Larry, how're you doing?
- Hey, Tool Man.

00:56.289 --> 00:58.056
- Where's Hernando?
- Hey, Al.

00:58.124 --> 00:59.992
Oh, he went to that great
junkyard in the sky.

01:00.059 --> 01:02.727
- Years ago.
- Yeah. Actually,

01:02.796 --> 01:04.495
Hernando's ashes,

01:04.563 --> 01:07.132
they're in the ashtray of that
Metropolitan right there.

01:07.200 --> 01:09.134
It was a great service,
very emotional.

01:09.202 --> 01:11.369
Put him in there butt-first.

01:12.806 --> 01:13.843
When I was a kid,
remember that dog

01:13.873 --> 01:15.307
that used to bother me
all the time?

01:15.374 --> 01:16.846
- You're talking about Snuggles?
- Snuggles, yeah.

01:16.876 --> 01:19.311
- Oh, yeah. He's still here.
- That's impossible.

01:19.378 --> 01:22.815
In dog years he'd be, well, old.

01:22.882 --> 01:27.252
He's right over here.
Look for yourself.

01:27.320 --> 01:30.722
He likes the shade of this Hudson here.
I don't know why.

01:30.790 --> 01:33.692
What do you say,
Snuggles? Remember me?

01:39.232 --> 01:41.400
I haven't seen him
move like that in years.

01:41.467 --> 01:43.202
He must really hate you.

01:43.269 --> 01:47.573
He's probably still miffed since I
told him he had to stop dating my leg.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.441
Moving along.

01:49.509 --> 01:52.344
Now, you're probably wondering
how anybody could find anything

01:52.412 --> 01:53.979
in a junkyard.

01:54.047 --> 01:56.018
Well, you know, these days pretty
much everything is computerized.

01:56.048 --> 01:59.150
Of course, that's the only
computer I need, you know?

01:59.218 --> 02:01.620
A place for everything,
and everything in its place.

02:01.754 --> 02:03.655
All right, Mr. Organization.

02:03.722 --> 02:06.891
How about this?
A 1967 Dodge Slant Six.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.592
Starter motor.

02:10.630 --> 02:13.665
There you go. Slant Six.

02:13.733 --> 02:15.700
There's your starter
right there.

02:15.768 --> 02:18.403
You have to try just a little
bit harder to stump old Larry.

02:18.538 --> 02:19.809
All right, Larry.
How about this?

02:19.839 --> 02:24.209
A thermostat cover
to a Bonneville. A 428.

02:24.277 --> 02:27.880
How about right here on the
end of the old bathroom key?

02:27.947 --> 02:30.615
- That's just freaky.
- No, that's just lucky.

02:30.617 --> 02:32.617
Oh, yeah. And your
career is built on,

02:32.685 --> 02:34.987
like, talent and skill, right?

02:35.054 --> 02:37.422
Moving on, Larry.

02:37.490 --> 02:39.725
All right, now it's time to
take a look at the big daddy

02:39.792 --> 02:41.760
of junkyard equipment.

02:41.827 --> 02:43.895
Car crusher.

02:43.963 --> 02:45.635
All right, Larry. Why don't you tell
our crowd something about this?

02:45.665 --> 02:48.700
I'll be glad to, Tim. This
portable car crusher is powered by

02:48.768 --> 02:51.436
a 120-horsepower Detroit Diesel.

02:51.504 --> 02:54.573
It will crush a two-ton
car down to 12 inches.

02:54.641 --> 02:56.207
And my guess is,

02:56.276 --> 02:59.745
these are the gallant road warriors
awaiting their final fate.

02:59.812 --> 03:03.848
Ah. Sweet Galaxie,
noble Skylark.

03:03.916 --> 03:06.351
And look at this,
a Corvair convertible.

03:06.419 --> 03:08.654
My first car was a Corvair.

03:08.721 --> 03:10.421
Just like this.
Same color, actually.

03:10.489 --> 03:12.490
Even the same Western
Michigan parking sticker

03:12.558 --> 03:14.492
on the windshield.

03:14.560 --> 03:16.694
Wait a minute.

03:16.762 --> 03:19.597
I think this is my car.
When did this come in?

03:19.665 --> 03:21.299
It came in about a year ago.

03:21.367 --> 03:23.101
It's been picked pretty clean.

03:24.136 --> 03:26.037
No kidding.

03:26.105 --> 03:29.574
- I should've never sold this car.
- Tim, we're still rolling.

03:31.511 --> 03:33.545
Well, she's here
if you want her.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.481
For now.

03:38.000 --> 03:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:32.338 --> 04:33.805
Week four.

04:33.873 --> 04:38.209
The everyday existence
of a typical suburban family.

04:38.277 --> 04:41.145
This is good. This is good.
You can get me studying.

04:41.213 --> 04:45.016
A middle-aged mom goes back to
school to recapture her youth.

04:49.522 --> 04:51.556
Pathetic? You be the judge.

04:53.860 --> 04:55.560
You want pathetic?

04:55.628 --> 04:56.999
Why don't you take some
shots of a 14-year-old

04:57.029 --> 04:59.197
who never gets an allowance?

05:00.866 --> 05:01.866
And cut.

05:03.970 --> 05:06.738
Hello! Hello! How was
soccer practice?

05:06.806 --> 05:08.873
Great. Great. I have
something for you.

05:08.941 --> 05:12.677
Stinky soccer clothes you
should be laundering yourself?

05:12.745 --> 05:14.045
Ah, no. A hug.

05:16.048 --> 05:18.282
I'll take that. Oh, I've
got something for you.

05:18.350 --> 05:21.052
This is the application for the
University of Pennsylvania.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.721
Oh, cool. Cool.

05:22.788 --> 05:24.961
You know, a lot of guys on the
team are sending in video resumes

05:24.991 --> 05:26.925
along with their applications.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.063
You mean like soccer highlights?

05:28.093 --> 05:30.061
Yeah. And talking
about themselves.

05:30.129 --> 05:33.035
If I did one, it would be a chance to
show those colleges "Brad, the guy."

05:33.065 --> 05:34.866
I'm sure they're waiting
by their mailboxes.

05:36.702 --> 05:39.170
Anyways,

05:39.238 --> 05:40.738
I'd love to do
a video but I heard

05:40.806 --> 05:43.041
these guys charge,
like, a thousand bucks.

05:43.109 --> 05:45.229
Well, you know, I know somebody
that's really talented

05:45.278 --> 05:47.845
who could do it
for considerably less.

05:47.914 --> 05:50.248
You've gotta be kidding! Mark?

05:50.316 --> 05:52.721
You already got the camera. You
could do the editing at school.

05:52.751 --> 05:55.153
- We'll pay for the tape.
- Well,

05:55.221 --> 05:59.090
doing an interesting video about Brad
would be a real tough challenge.

06:00.893 --> 06:02.498
Yeah and me getting through
without killing you

06:02.528 --> 06:05.163
would be an even tougher
challenge, wouldn't it?

06:05.231 --> 06:08.300
This is great! Teamwork!

06:08.367 --> 06:12.270
All right. Well, let's go upstairs
and discuss my hair options.

06:14.907 --> 06:16.174
Hi, there.

06:16.242 --> 06:17.342
Oh, hi. Hi.

06:19.845 --> 06:21.946
You smell good.
Where have you been?

06:22.014 --> 06:24.882
The junkyard.

06:24.950 --> 06:27.485
On the way home, I picked you
up something real special.

06:27.553 --> 06:28.887
You did?

06:32.124 --> 06:34.826
"The Gabor Sisters
Beauty Sampler."

06:37.496 --> 06:40.031
Well, this is so thoughtful.

06:40.099 --> 06:42.100
You're not getting another car.

06:43.769 --> 06:45.070
Well, it's not really a car car.

06:45.137 --> 06:46.871
It's more of a shell of a car.

06:46.939 --> 06:49.908
You know, I want to buy it from
the junkyard. $165, come on!

06:49.975 --> 06:52.048
And eventually it'll become my
next project. What do you think?

06:52.078 --> 06:55.847
Until then that hunk of junk just
sits, what? Out in the front yard?

06:55.915 --> 06:57.435
- Actually, in the driveway.
- Oh, man!

06:57.482 --> 06:59.889
Just for a couple of months till I
find a place to store it. You know?

06:59.919 --> 07:03.421
It'll start snowing soon.
You won't even see it.

07:03.488 --> 07:06.724
And then once the snow melts, then
we have a rusted hunk of junk.

07:06.792 --> 07:09.561
It's already
a rusted hunk of junk.

07:09.628 --> 07:12.297
But this is, get this,
my first car.

07:12.364 --> 07:14.203
Your first car, your third
car, your 20-third car...

07:14.233 --> 07:15.866
No, no, no.
You don't understand.

07:15.934 --> 07:18.769
This is the first car I ever owned.
It's that old Corvair.

07:18.837 --> 07:21.005
Honey, you don't have the
time to work on this car.

07:21.073 --> 07:23.112
And we don't have the space to
store it until you have the time.

07:23.142 --> 07:24.542
We certainly
don't have the money.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.478
I mean, it'll cost
a fortune to restore it.

07:26.545 --> 07:28.784
And we gotta save that money
for the kids' college funds.

07:28.814 --> 07:31.716
Okay, okay. I understand all that.
But this is fate.

07:31.783 --> 07:33.023
I mean, what are the odds of me

07:33.085 --> 07:35.220
crossing paths
with my old Corvair?

07:35.287 --> 07:38.656
Better than the odds of me
letting you bring it home.

07:45.063 --> 07:47.098
Hey, Mark. Maybe I
used too much mousse.

07:52.204 --> 07:54.072
You look like a pineapple.

07:55.708 --> 07:57.175
Let me see your script.

07:57.242 --> 07:59.448
I don't have a script. I figured
I was just gonna wing it.

07:59.478 --> 08:02.047
Won't the Ivy League love that?

08:02.114 --> 08:04.649
Look, I just don't want my video
looking like everybody else's.

08:04.717 --> 08:06.718
- All right, you ready?
- Yeah.

08:06.786 --> 08:09.187
And action.

08:09.255 --> 08:12.390
Yo, yo, yo, what's up?
I'm Brad, I'm bad.

08:14.893 --> 08:17.929
This is my pad.

08:17.997 --> 08:21.099
This is where I kick back when I'm
not kicking in all those goals.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.368
Oh, oh, look at
who just walked in.

08:24.903 --> 08:27.872
Folks, this is the
number-one lady in my life.

08:27.940 --> 08:29.807
Hey, Mom, say hi.

08:29.875 --> 08:31.743
Hi.

08:31.810 --> 08:34.111
No matter how many goals I
score or how many tests I ace,

08:34.179 --> 08:36.615
I always make time
for my main mom.

08:39.217 --> 08:42.953
No, honey, no. You're
laying it on real thick.

08:43.020 --> 08:44.955
What am I supposed to say?

08:45.023 --> 08:47.358
Hi, my name is Brad.
I really love to play soccer.

08:47.426 --> 08:49.093
And I'd love to come play
for your school.

08:49.161 --> 08:51.562
- That's better.
- Hey, hey, hey.

08:51.630 --> 08:53.464
I'm Tim Taylor. I'm Brad's dad.

08:53.532 --> 08:55.333
I just found my first car today.

08:57.503 --> 08:59.137
I'd like to keep it
but somebody,

08:59.205 --> 09:01.506
I won't mention names,
won't let me.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.308
Cut.

09:09.315 --> 09:10.715
Hey, Wilson.

09:10.783 --> 09:13.084
Well, top o' the morning
to you, Taylor lass.

09:13.152 --> 09:14.619
What are you doing there?

09:14.687 --> 09:17.889
Oh, some friends of mine from
Ireland are getting married.

09:17.957 --> 09:19.991
I'm building
them a wedding arch.

09:20.059 --> 09:21.626
It's really beautiful.

09:21.693 --> 09:23.161
Well, thank you very much.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.029
So, how are things
over in Taylorville?

09:25.197 --> 09:26.864
Ah, well,

09:26.932 --> 09:31.369
for starters, Tim got me a
Gabor Sisters Beauty Sampler.

09:31.437 --> 09:33.037
Ah, he bought another car, huh?

09:35.174 --> 09:36.641
He's pushing for it.

09:36.708 --> 09:38.977
He found a shell
in the junkyard.

09:39.045 --> 09:41.050
And he doesn't have the time
or the money to spend on it.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.251
And we have no place
to store it.

09:42.281 --> 09:43.585
But just because
it's his first car,

09:43.615 --> 09:45.183
he thinks it's this
really big deal...

09:45.251 --> 09:46.823
Now, wait... Whoa, whoa,
whoa, just a second.

09:46.853 --> 09:48.586
Tim found his first car?

09:48.654 --> 09:50.192
Apparently, you think
it's a big deal, too?

09:50.222 --> 09:52.056
I would kill for my first car.

09:52.124 --> 09:54.359
You know, it was
a little Morris Minor.

09:54.426 --> 09:56.661
I'll never forget it.
Gosh, I miss it!

09:56.729 --> 09:59.497
- You keep a picture of it in your wallet?
- Hmm.

09:59.565 --> 10:01.866
What is the deal with men
and their first cars?

10:02.134 --> 10:05.603
Well, Jill, sometimes in our
society, a young man's self-image is

10:05.670 --> 10:07.838
defined by his first automobile.

10:07.940 --> 10:10.608
No. You're saying that men define
who they are as human beings

10:10.676 --> 10:12.043
by four wheels and an engine?

10:12.111 --> 10:14.145
Don't you think
that's kind of shallow?

10:14.213 --> 10:15.947
No, I don't think so.

10:16.014 --> 10:18.049
No, of course, you don't.
You're one of them.

10:19.618 --> 10:23.588
No. The first car represents
freedom and independence.

10:23.656 --> 10:28.659
I tell you, there's nothing more
exhilarating for a young man

10:28.727 --> 10:32.096
than getting behind the wheel of
the car, revving up that engine,

10:32.164 --> 10:34.899
racing off to
his first Mozart festival.

10:37.903 --> 10:40.939
Well, maybe that's just me.

10:41.006 --> 10:43.641
I don't get it. I just...
I guess it's just because

10:43.709 --> 10:46.410
I was never emotionally
attached to a car.

10:46.478 --> 10:49.047
Well, Jill, have you ever
had any rite of passage

10:49.115 --> 10:51.816
that showed your independence?

10:51.884 --> 10:55.820
Yeah. When I moved out of my parents'
house and got my own apartment.

10:55.888 --> 10:56.954
It was so cute.

10:58.724 --> 11:02.827
I had these Doobie Brothers posters
plastered all over the walls.

11:02.895 --> 11:06.197
And this waterbed that would
slosh whenever I was...

11:08.767 --> 11:10.635
Did I mention
the Doobie Brothers posters?

11:10.702 --> 11:13.737
Ah, yes, yes. Yes, you did.

11:13.805 --> 11:18.776
So, you're saying that to Tim, this is
way more than a rusted hunk of metal.

11:18.844 --> 11:22.714
Yes. Just think of it as your
apartment, without the sloshing.

11:27.152 --> 11:29.692
So, if you're looking for a star
forward who's got all the right moves

11:29.722 --> 11:31.890
on and off the field,
you gotta think Brad.

11:31.957 --> 11:33.892
All right? You got two choices.

11:33.959 --> 11:36.527
I could play for you,
or I could play against you.

11:36.595 --> 11:38.629
Either way,
I'll see you this fall.

11:38.698 --> 11:41.499
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.

11:47.939 --> 11:50.374
Tim, I was thinking about this
thing with the first car.

11:50.442 --> 11:52.614
I've been thinking about it all day.
That's why I'm cooking dinner

11:52.644 --> 11:54.283
to keep my mind off it.
Just keep cooking,

11:54.313 --> 11:55.951
- cutting, cooking, cutting, cooking...
- You can have the car.

11:55.981 --> 11:57.315
That's how bad
it's gotten to me.

11:57.382 --> 12:00.684
I swear I just heard you say,
"You could have the car."

12:00.752 --> 12:04.656
- Cut and cook. Cut and cook...
- I did.

12:04.723 --> 12:08.926
Now, don't toy with me.
I'm in a very delicate condition.

12:08.994 --> 12:11.562
You can have the car. Wilson
said that he'd store it.

12:11.630 --> 12:12.930
I can have the car?

12:12.998 --> 12:13.998
You can have the car.

12:14.032 --> 12:16.534
- Say it again.
- You can have the car.

12:16.602 --> 12:18.503
God bless those Gabor sisters!

12:22.741 --> 12:24.475
Hey, Larry!

12:24.543 --> 12:26.544
I've come to get the car!

12:26.612 --> 12:28.646
Oh, uh...

12:30.883 --> 12:32.321
Look, Snuggles, I'm
just here to get my car

12:32.351 --> 12:34.319
and then I'm gonna
take off, okay?

12:37.356 --> 12:39.390
Look! Poodle!

12:40.892 --> 12:43.027
Look there.

12:44.263 --> 12:46.597
Wait a minute! Larry!

12:56.475 --> 12:58.876
I'm gonna hold you personally
responsible for this!

13:05.083 --> 13:06.917
Well, hi, honey.
Did you get your car?

13:06.985 --> 13:10.388
Yeah. I got there just in time to see
it turned into a big, steel tortilla.

13:10.455 --> 13:12.122
Oh, my God!

13:12.124 --> 13:13.857
And on the way home
I realized I'm an idiot.

13:13.925 --> 13:15.759
Do you want to know
why I'm an idiot?

13:15.827 --> 13:18.229
Because you listened to me
and you didn't get the car?

13:18.297 --> 13:20.498
If only it were that simple.

13:21.500 --> 13:22.866
All the way home in the car,

13:22.934 --> 13:24.306
I was trying to figure out
a way to blame you.

13:24.336 --> 13:25.769
Truth is, it's my fault.

13:25.837 --> 13:28.043
I should never have sold that
Corvair in the first place.

13:28.073 --> 13:31.041
You can't blame yourself for
selling a car 25 years ago.

13:31.109 --> 13:33.944
Oh, watch me.

13:34.012 --> 13:36.847
So what if it had 130,000
well-earned miles on it?

13:36.915 --> 13:39.020
So what if the defroster never
worked in the wintertime?

13:39.050 --> 13:43.187
So what if the muffler sounded like Al's
mom after a whole day of Beano? Huh?

13:43.255 --> 13:44.622
Honey, you want
a nice cup of tea?

13:44.690 --> 13:46.156
A cup of tea's not gonna cut it!

13:46.225 --> 13:47.558
Bratwurst?

13:50.862 --> 13:53.213
You know the sad irony,
the cruel irony here?

13:53.244 --> 13:55.129
The car crusher?

13:55.167 --> 13:56.834
- It was a Binford.
- Oh.

13:58.570 --> 13:59.837
Hey, Dad, you get the car?

13:59.905 --> 14:01.109
I'm an idiot.
You want to know why?

14:01.139 --> 14:02.973
No. No need to explain.

14:05.977 --> 14:08.379
Your dad's car got
crunched at the junkyard

14:08.447 --> 14:11.081
and it's all my fault. I wish
there was something I could do.

14:11.149 --> 14:14.485
We could try to find him
an old Corvair frame.

14:14.553 --> 14:16.287
That's a great idea.

14:16.355 --> 14:17.888
I could check all the junkyards,

14:17.956 --> 14:19.457
go through his
old car magazines.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.258
Yeah. You could even
check the Internet.

14:21.327 --> 14:23.294
You could help me.

14:23.362 --> 14:26.263
Why would I help you?

14:26.265 --> 14:29.167
Because, Brad, no matter
how many goals you score,

14:29.234 --> 14:31.635
no matter how many
tests you ace,

14:31.703 --> 14:34.438
you've always got time
for your main mom.

14:39.411 --> 14:40.983
Brad, do you think that
your father would notice

14:41.013 --> 14:42.947
if the Corvair was a '67?

14:43.015 --> 14:46.250
Mom, Dad would notice if the
dipstick was the wrong color.

14:46.351 --> 14:47.885
No, thanks. Bye.

14:49.020 --> 14:50.321
Well,

14:50.389 --> 14:53.291
that was the last junkyard.
So much for that good idea.

14:53.358 --> 14:55.626
Hey, Mom, check out
the <i>Corvair Club Magazine.</i>

14:55.694 --> 14:58.596
There's a guy selling a '66
Corvair just like Dad's.

14:58.664 --> 14:59.964
Let me see here.

15:01.399 --> 15:03.138
Well, you know what?
Maybe I should call him.

15:03.168 --> 15:05.803
He might have a lead on a frame.

15:05.871 --> 15:08.439
Yeah. It says he's the
president of the Corvair Club.

15:08.507 --> 15:10.975
If anyone's gonna know,
it's gonna be him.

15:11.042 --> 15:13.311
Hello. Is this Gunther Frank?

15:14.913 --> 15:17.949
Oh, sorry. Gunther Frank?

15:21.320 --> 15:23.154
Uh...

15:23.221 --> 15:28.492
Gunther, I saw your car in the <i>Corvair
Club Magazine.</i> And I was wondering...

15:28.560 --> 15:31.128
Yes, yes, it's <i>wunderbar.</i>

15:32.364 --> 15:34.832
It's very, very <i>wunderbar.</i> Yeah.

15:34.899 --> 15:37.001
No, no, I'm not
looking for that car.

15:37.069 --> 15:39.670
I'm looking for that car,
only a junker.

15:41.073 --> 15:42.940
You do?

15:43.008 --> 15:47.645
Oh, great! Okay. Well, where
would we go to meet you?

15:47.713 --> 15:50.314
Yeah, yeah. We'll be
right over there.

15:50.382 --> 15:54.952
<i>Auf Wiedersehen</i> to you,
too, Gunther.

15:55.020 --> 15:57.822
Here at Binford, we're not just tool
people. Darn it, we're educators!

15:57.890 --> 16:01.392
That's right. Each week Tim
teaches you what not to do.

16:05.731 --> 16:08.065
After a recent automotive
loss in my life,

16:08.132 --> 16:10.934
I convinced Binford to start a
program that will educate kids,

16:11.002 --> 16:12.803
and save cars at the same time.

16:12.871 --> 16:16.173
Our aim is to get the kids off the street
and into the garage restoring cars.

16:16.241 --> 16:19.209
Now, Binford will supply the
tools and the work space,

16:19.277 --> 16:21.512
but we need you to
supply the vehicle.

16:21.580 --> 16:23.481
Now where are we
gonna get those cars?

16:23.548 --> 16:25.282
Hmm.

16:25.350 --> 16:26.517
Welcome to...

16:29.988 --> 16:32.523
That's right. Today we've got
some pictures of junkyard cars

16:32.591 --> 16:35.693
that you can save from a
crushing, cruel fate.

16:35.761 --> 16:38.529
Now some of these pictures might be
a bit graphic for the youngsters

16:38.597 --> 16:40.097
so, hide them now.

16:46.572 --> 16:48.639
Anyway, first up we have

16:48.707 --> 16:53.644
a 1972 Mercury Comet
for only $340.

16:53.712 --> 16:57.414
The body's actually held up
pretty well, unlike some of us.

16:58.516 --> 16:59.955
Little bit of work,
she's back to new.

16:59.985 --> 17:01.085
Does she deserve to die?

17:01.152 --> 17:02.720
I don't think so.

17:02.788 --> 17:04.521
So, come on, people.
Pick up those phones

17:04.589 --> 17:07.724
and call 1-600-Z-CARZ-4-U.

17:09.060 --> 17:11.194
Operators are standing by.

17:13.799 --> 17:15.465
- Adopt A Car.
- Adopt A Car.

17:15.532 --> 17:19.502
Okay. Now, our second item up to
sponsor is a 1963 Chevrolet Impala.

17:19.570 --> 17:21.777
It needs wheels, tires, running gear.
Pretty much everything.

17:21.807 --> 17:25.076
Action figure sold separately.

17:25.143 --> 17:28.378
Sponsor this for $200 and you can
turn this into a kid's first car.

17:28.446 --> 17:30.814
And he can fill it
with his own memories, huh?

17:30.882 --> 17:33.717
Call now, will you? $200.
Sponsor this car.

17:36.288 --> 17:40.625
I can't hear the phones ringing.
Hello?

17:40.692 --> 17:43.994
All right, you call right
now, lunch with the Tool Man.

17:47.533 --> 17:50.134
All right, all right.
Lunch with Heidi.

17:55.640 --> 17:57.074
Why won't the garage door open?

17:57.142 --> 17:58.642
Well, I don't know.

17:58.710 --> 18:01.212
I tell you not to lock that.
Then I can't pull the car in.

18:01.279 --> 18:03.648
Well, why don't you
check it out?

18:09.755 --> 18:12.023
- What do you think?
- What is it?

18:14.760 --> 18:17.261
It's a 1966 Corvair Corsa,

18:17.329 --> 18:19.663
four on the floor, 140 horses.

18:21.399 --> 18:23.901
You brought my car back
from the grave! Hallelujah!

18:25.337 --> 18:27.638
- It's not your car.
- I know that.

18:27.706 --> 18:29.673
This is beautiful.
What's it doing in the garage?

18:29.742 --> 18:31.442
- I bought it.
- You what?

18:31.509 --> 18:33.244
I was just gonna buy a frame.

18:33.311 --> 18:37.115
But the guy gave me such a good
deal, I couldn't resist it.

18:37.182 --> 18:39.383
- What did you pay for this?
- Nothing.

18:39.451 --> 18:40.618
What?

18:40.685 --> 18:42.686
I traded my Healey for it.

18:47.525 --> 18:51.028
You traded your fully-restored
Austin-Healey just so I could have this?

18:51.096 --> 18:52.596
Yeah, I did.

18:52.664 --> 18:54.799
You got freaking ripped off.

19:02.107 --> 19:04.408
Why? What do you mean?

19:04.476 --> 19:07.511
As much as I love Corvairs, a
Healey's worth a lot more than this.

19:07.579 --> 19:11.014
Oh, I like this car.
The whole family fits in it.

19:11.082 --> 19:14.051
It has an electrical system
that actually works.

19:16.354 --> 19:18.522
Is this Gunther's car?

19:18.590 --> 19:21.759
You know Gunther?

19:21.826 --> 19:24.394
Everybody knows Gunther.
He's the chairman of the Corvair Club.

19:24.462 --> 19:26.730
Well, wait. I don't get it.
Do you like it or not?

19:26.798 --> 19:30.467
I love this. I love this. This is the
nicest thing you've ever done for me.

19:30.535 --> 19:32.641
But we've gotta take it back and
get the Healey back, you know?

19:32.671 --> 19:34.905
- I can't accept this.
- Why not?

19:36.274 --> 19:37.908
Well, I wanted
my Corvair back. Not his.

19:37.976 --> 19:39.944
Well, it's practically the same.

19:40.011 --> 19:41.382
Well, it's not
really about the car.

19:41.412 --> 19:43.047
It's about what
it represented to me.

19:43.114 --> 19:45.219
When I bought the Corvair, all my
V8 buddies thought it was, like,

19:45.249 --> 19:47.618
the biggest geek mobile.
But I loved it.

19:47.686 --> 19:49.587
- The reason I...
- Well,

19:49.654 --> 19:52.189
your sense of self was defined
by your first set of wheels.

19:52.256 --> 19:53.557
Exactly. I mean, on the surface,

19:53.625 --> 19:55.196
Corvairs seemed like they
were the geek mobile,

19:55.226 --> 19:57.761
but under the surface,
they were, like, cutting edge.

19:57.829 --> 19:59.997
- But I still want to take it back.
- Okay.

20:00.065 --> 20:01.505
Tomorrow we'll do that.
But right now

20:01.566 --> 20:03.533
let's take an imaginary trip
in my old Corvair.

20:03.602 --> 20:04.902
Ooh. Okay.

20:04.970 --> 20:06.203
Okay.

20:06.270 --> 20:08.405
All right, shut your eyes.

20:08.473 --> 20:10.307
Tell me what your mind sees.

20:10.374 --> 20:13.744
Oh, it's nothing I see,
it's what I smell.

20:13.812 --> 20:15.512
Your Hai Karate.

20:17.115 --> 20:20.517
- Christmas gift from Aunt Barb.
- Mmm-hmm.

20:20.519 --> 20:22.720
Went to a drive-in
movie off campus.

20:22.788 --> 20:25.323
Double feature. <i>Omen.</i>

20:25.390 --> 20:26.390
<i>Exorcist.</i>

20:26.458 --> 20:27.558
Oh, yeah!

20:29.794 --> 20:32.062
Your mother shops at Penney's!

20:34.433 --> 20:36.467
- You were so freaked out.
- Me?

20:36.535 --> 20:40.070
You were the one that had your
head buried in my chest all night.

20:42.040 --> 20:45.542
That wasn't 'cause
I was freaked out.

20:45.610 --> 20:49.847
I knew that. You did the same thing
when we saw <i>The Sound of Music.</i>

20:49.914 --> 20:52.717
The hills were alive.

20:52.784 --> 20:56.086
I don't know about alive.
But they were a lot higher then.

20:57.755 --> 20:59.828
Didn't we go to that Doobie
Brothers concert in this car?

20:59.858 --> 21:01.525
- Yes.
- Yeah.

21:01.593 --> 21:03.164
And then we went back
to your place and...

21:03.194 --> 21:04.528
Sloshed.

21:18.009 --> 21:20.277
<i>Hello. My name is Brad.
I really love to play soccer.</i>

21:20.345 --> 21:23.147
<i>And I'd love to come play
for your school.</i>

21:24.549 --> 21:27.718
Hey, that was great.

21:27.785 --> 21:29.252
I don't get it.

21:29.321 --> 21:31.388
You only used one line
of dialog I gave you.

21:31.456 --> 21:33.724
What happened to
all my great interviews?

21:33.758 --> 21:35.459
I burned them.

21:36.294 --> 21:38.095
'Cause I care.

21:38.163 --> 21:41.665
Mark, I think that thing was great.
It really was a good job.

21:41.733 --> 21:43.968
How about this?
You come behind the scenes of <i>Tool Time</i>

21:44.036 --> 21:47.138
and do a brilliant documentary
on dear old Dad.

21:47.205 --> 21:49.639
Dad, I'm an artist,
not a magician.

21:53.645 --> 21:55.580
We're educators!

21:55.647 --> 21:57.682
Yeah! Yeah!

22:08.926 --> 22:11.595
Right now let's take an imaginary
trip in my old Corvair.

22:11.662 --> 22:13.597
Oh, if you can
open it, you mean?
