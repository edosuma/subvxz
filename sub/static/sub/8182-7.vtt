00:07.156 --> 00:08.723
A- BUB-BUB-BUB-BUB!

00:08.790 --> 00:10.424
YOU HAVE A SEAT,
YOUNG LADY.

00:10.492 --> 00:13.028
TODAY, I AM TAKING
CARE OF BREAKFAST.

00:13.095 --> 00:14.495
WHATEVER YOU'RE IN THE
MOOD FOR, YOU JUST NAME IT.

00:14.563 --> 00:15.763
OH! OK.

00:15.831 --> 00:18.833
UM, HOW ABOUT A SHORT STACK OF PANCAKES?

00:19.619 --> 00:21.536
OK, I'M MAKING EGGS.

00:21.603 --> 00:23.805
OK. I'LL HAVE 2,
SUNNY SIDE UP.

00:25.224 --> 00:26.191
ALREADY SCRAMBLED.

00:26.259 --> 00:27.608
PERFECT! PERFECT.

00:28.811 --> 00:32.345
WHOOP. GOT A LITTLE
SHELL IN THERE.

00:32.414 --> 00:34.132

00:43.375 --> 00:45.110
TAKE IT TO THE EDGE

00:45.177 --> 00:47.445
I GOT IT.

00:47.512 --> 00:48.179
DAMMIT!

00:49.431 --> 00:51.967
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
TAKE IT TO THE EDGE.

00:52.034 --> 00:53.701
NOT GONNA WORK

00:53.769 --> 00:54.802
I GOT IT.
I GOT-WHOOP!

00:54.871 --> 00:56.304
I GOT A HAIR

00:57.706 --> 00:59.473
TAKE IT TO THE EDGE.

00:59.541 --> 01:02.744
TAKE THE HAIR
TO THE EDGE.

01:02.812 --> 01:04.045
I GOT IT.

01:04.113 --> 01:06.131
WE'RE ALL GOOD.

01:06.199 --> 01:08.900
WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT?

01:08.968 --> 01:11.303
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M JUST
GONNA GRAB SOMETHING AT WORK.

01:11.370 --> 01:13.004
COME ON!

01:13.072 --> 01:15.740
WHATEVER IT IS, THE
HEAT'LL KILL IT. JUST STAY!

01:53.929 --> 01:54.863
HEY, ARTHUR.

01:54.930 --> 01:55.997
HEY.

01:56.064 --> 01:57.799
UM, IS CARRIE HOME?

01:57.867 --> 01:59.734
NOPE, THEY'RE OUT
WITH FRIENDS.

01:59.802 --> 02:01.920
I JUST FINISHED
WATCHING TV IN THEIR BED.

02:01.987 --> 02:03.154
MUM'S THE WORD.

02:03.222 --> 02:05.874
SHE SAID SHE HAD A
BOOK ON RÉSUMÉ WRITING

02:05.941 --> 02:06.875
THAT SHE
WOULD LOAN ME.

02:06.942 --> 02:08.508
I- I GOTTA
FIND A NEW JOB.

02:08.577 --> 02:10.979
MY UNEMPLOYMENT RUNS
OUT IN, LIKE, A WEEK.

02:11.045 --> 02:14.215
AH, YES, NO MORE SUCKING
ON THE TAXPAYER'S TEAT!

02:15.584 --> 02:18.153
RIGHT. WOULD-WOULD YOU HAPPEN
TO KNOW WHERE THAT BOOK IS?

02:18.220 --> 02:21.355
SPENCER, HOW-TO BOOKS
ARE A WASTE OF TIME.

02:21.423 --> 02:24.125
I CAN TEACH YOU EVERYTHING
YOU NEED TO KNOW.

02:24.193 --> 02:26.978
UH-HUH. UM, ARTHUR,
I THINK I'D RATHER

02:27.046 --> 02:30.782
LEARN FROM SOMEONE WHO'S
BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT...

02:30.849 --> 02:31.783
ANYTHING.

02:32.985 --> 02:34.702
TOUCHÉ. IT'S TRUE.

02:34.770 --> 02:37.171
I'VE NEVER HELD
A JOB VERY LONG,

02:37.239 --> 02:40.241
BUT I'VE LANDED MYSELF
OVER 74 OF THEM-

02:40.309 --> 02:41.576
ONE AS A WOMAN!

02:42.578 --> 02:44.479
YEAH, I'M GONNA KEEP
LOOKING FOR THAT BOOK.

02:44.546 --> 02:46.914
LOOK, SPENCER. ALL DAY
LONG, I SIT IN THAT BASEMENT

02:46.983 --> 02:49.317
DOING THE WORD JUMBLES
AND PRAYING FOR DEATH.

02:49.385 --> 02:51.219
IF I COULD HELP
SOMEONE ELSE SUCCEED,

02:51.287 --> 02:53.154
I'D BE ACCOMPLISHING
SOMETHING.

02:53.856 --> 02:56.741
LET ME LIVE
THROUGH YOU, HUH?

02:57.509 --> 03:00.327
I- ALL RIGHT,
WHAT DO WE DO?

03:00.395 --> 03:02.097
COME DOWNSTAIRS.

03:02.248 --> 03:03.615
WE'LL PLAY
SOME TRUST GAMES

03:03.683 --> 03:05.950
AND TAKE IT
FROM THERE.

03:06.018 --> 03:07.668
COME ON-
LET'S GO, BABY.

03:09.938 --> 03:12.239
I'M GLAD WE DID
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

03:12.307 --> 03:14.509
NAH, THAT'S THE LAST
MAGIC SHOW I GO TO.

03:14.576 --> 03:17.379
I DON'T NEED TO PICK
A CARD OR SEE A BUNNY.

03:17.446 --> 03:18.646
THOSE METAL HOOPS-

03:18.714 --> 03:20.081
THEY CAN KEEP 'EM
TOGETHER, TAKE 'EM APART-

03:20.148 --> 03:21.248
I- I-I DON'T CARE!

03:21.316 --> 03:23.385
WELL, I THOUGHT
HE WAS AMAZING.

03:23.452 --> 03:24.836
MAN, YOU'RE JUST UPSET
'CAUSE HE SAID HE NEEDED

03:24.904 --> 03:26.621
A BIGGER SAW
TO CUT YOU IN HALF.

03:28.357 --> 03:30.925
IF A MAGICIAN
NEEDS TO BE HURTFUL,

03:30.993 --> 03:32.227
HE'S NOT VERY GOOD.

03:33.595 --> 03:34.896
ALL RIGHT, NEXT WEEKEND
WE'LL DO SOMETHING

03:34.964 --> 03:36.397
THAT'S A LITTLE
MORE YOUR SPEED.

03:36.465 --> 03:38.600
ACTUALLY, WE GOT
PLANS NEXT WEEKEND.

03:38.667 --> 03:40.602
NO, WE DON'T.
YEAH, WE DO.

03:40.669 --> 03:41.802
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
I WAS GONNA WAIT,

03:41.870 --> 03:43.338
BUT I'VE HAD
SOMETHING POKING ME

03:43.406 --> 03:44.772
IN THE POCKET
ALL NIGHT LONG.

03:47.859 --> 03:50.528
YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA KEEP
THAT GOING TILL NEXT WEEKEND?

03:51.396 --> 03:52.880
YOU KNOW WHAT
THESE ARE?

03:52.948 --> 03:53.781
WE GOT IT?

03:53.849 --> 03:54.849
I JUST SIGNED
THE PAPERS TODAY.

03:54.917 --> 03:55.883
OH!

03:55.951 --> 03:57.769
WHA...? WHA-WHAT'S GOING ON?

03:57.837 --> 03:59.203
WE GOT A VACATION HOME.

04:00.856 --> 04:01.923
WHAT?

04:01.990 --> 04:03.091
CAN YOU
BELIEVE IT?

04:03.158 --> 04:06.194
I CANNOT BELIEVE IT!

04:06.262 --> 04:08.063
I FORGOT
THE SAUCERS.

04:09.331 --> 04:10.231
SO WHERE IS IT?

04:10.299 --> 04:11.432
IT'S, LIKE, 2 HOURS
OUTSIDE OF THE CITY,

04:11.500 --> 04:12.851
RIGHT ON THIS LITTLE LAKE.

04:12.918 --> 04:13.901
YOU GUYS ARE
GONNA LOVE IT.

04:13.969 --> 04:15.436
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
HEY-LET'S CELEBRATE

04:15.504 --> 04:17.137
WITH SOME CAKE!

04:17.204 --> 04:19.990
OH, MY GOD, I'M SO
HAPPY. THIS IS FANTASTIC.

04:20.058 --> 04:22.209
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

04:22.277 --> 04:24.612
DON'T TELL ME
WE'RE OUT OF CAKE.

04:24.680 --> 04:25.747
NO!

04:25.814 --> 04:26.748
THEN WHAT IS IT?

04:26.815 --> 04:28.883
WHAT IS IT?

04:28.950 --> 04:31.452
HOW CAN YOU SAY,
"WHAT IS IT?"

04:33.188 --> 04:34.088
WHOM IS IT?

04:35.657 --> 04:38.809
DOUG, THEY BOUGHT
A VACATION HOUSE.

04:38.877 --> 04:40.378
A VACATION HOUSE!

04:40.446 --> 04:43.130
I GET IT.
OK, YOU'RE SAD

04:43.198 --> 04:43.982
'CAUSE YOUR FRIENDS
ARE HAPPY.

04:44.133 --> 04:45.200
COME HERE,
SOMEONE NEEDS A HUG!

04:45.267 --> 04:46.734
NO. NO!
I UNDERSTAND.

04:46.802 --> 04:48.035
LISTEN TO ME, MAN.

04:48.103 --> 04:50.354
I MEAN, HOW COME WE CAN'T
AFFORD A VACATION HOUSE?

04:50.422 --> 04:51.789
YOU MAKE JUST AS MUCH
MONEY AS DEACON DOES

04:51.857 --> 04:53.324
AND SHE DOESN'T
WORK AT ALL!

04:53.392 --> 04:55.676
MAYBE THEIR
RICH UNCLE DIED.

04:55.744 --> 04:57.411
I DIDN'T KNOW
THEY HAVE A RICH UNCLE.

04:57.479 --> 04:59.446
I DON'T THINK THEY DO. OH, COME ON!

04:59.514 --> 05:02.450
LOOK, MAYBE THEY GOT
SOME SORT OF SETTLEMENT.

05:02.517 --> 05:05.453
OH, LIKE FROM
A MALPRACTICE SUIT.

05:05.520 --> 05:07.621
A BOTCHED SURGERY MAYBE?

05:07.689 --> 05:09.641
YES, YES.

05:12.428 --> 05:13.978
OH, YEAH,
LOOK AT THAT.

05:14.045 --> 05:17.031
KELLY'S BOOBS
DO NOT LOOK RIGHT.

05:18.634 --> 05:20.701
EH, HER BOOBS ARE AS
GOOD AS YOURS OR MINE.

05:23.172 --> 05:24.322
H- HEY.

05:24.390 --> 05:25.457
HOW MANY PEOPLE DOES
IT TAKE TO CUT A CAKE,

05:25.524 --> 05:27.191
AM I RIGHT? WE'LL BE
RIGHT IN, ALL RIGHT.

05:27.259 --> 05:29.144
YOU JUST SLAP
A SMILE ON YOUR FACE

05:29.211 --> 05:31.312
AND YOU PRETEND YOU LIKE IT WHEN
GOOD THINGS HAPPEN TO OTHER PEOPLE.

05:31.380 --> 05:32.546
ALL RIGHT?
THEY'RE WAITING.

05:32.614 --> 05:34.915
NO, I CAN'T. JUST MAKE
AN EXCUSE OR SOMETHING.

05:34.983 --> 05:36.334
I- I HAVE
TO GET INTO BED.

05:36.402 --> 05:38.135
CARRIE. LOOK.

05:38.203 --> 05:40.505
THEY MAY HAVE A VACATION HOME ON A LAKE,

05:40.573 --> 05:42.073
BUT WE GOT SOMETHING MUCH BETTER.

05:42.140 --> 05:43.174
WHAT?

05:43.242 --> 05:45.577
WE GOT THIS.

05:52.100 --> 05:55.170
ALL RIGHT. YOU DONE
WITH THAT RÉSUMÉ YET?

05:55.237 --> 05:56.571
I WANT TO BE AT THE POOL BY 4:00.

05:56.639 --> 05:57.539
YEAH, HERE.

05:57.606 --> 05:59.307
TAKE A LOOK.

05:59.375 --> 06:01.509
"NAME-
SPENCE OLCHIN."

06:01.577 --> 06:03.477
NOT LOVING IT.

06:03.545 --> 06:05.196
MY NAME?

06:05.264 --> 06:07.382
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF "CLARK GABLE"?

06:07.449 --> 06:09.183
I- WHAT?

06:09.251 --> 06:12.053
"CLARK GABLE" WILL
GET YOU IN DOORS.

06:12.121 --> 06:13.188
IT'S AN ICEBREAKER-

06:13.255 --> 06:16.557
"OH, MY GOODNESS! YOUR
NAME IS CLARK GABLE!

06:16.625 --> 06:18.526
YOU'RE HIRED!"

06:18.593 --> 06:21.579
I- I'M GONNA STICK
WITH SPENCE OLCHIN.

06:21.647 --> 06:23.197
IT'S YOUR FUNERAL.

06:23.265 --> 06:26.234
NOW, WHAT DID YOU PUT
UNDER SPECIAL SKILLS?

06:26.301 --> 06:29.270
OH, UM-
"TYPE 60 WORDS A MINUTE."

06:29.338 --> 06:32.507
UH, "FAMILIAR WITH EXCEL AND
POWERPOINT COMPUTER PROGRAMS."

06:32.575 --> 06:35.476
UH, "SPEAK SPANISH
AND, UH, CERTIFIED C.P.R."

06:35.544 --> 06:36.710
MM-HMM.

06:36.778 --> 06:40.748
AND ARE YOU APPLYING FOR
A JOB AT A BOREDOM FACTORY?

06:40.815 --> 06:42.350
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

06:42.418 --> 06:45.019
NOTHING. YOU'RE BRUTAL ON PAPER.

06:45.087 --> 06:47.788
ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE...

06:47.856 --> 06:48.856
MOCK INTERVIEW.

06:48.924 --> 06:50.391
OK. ALL RIGHT.

06:50.459 --> 06:52.626
ALL RIGHT,
MR. OLCHIN.

06:54.879 --> 06:56.947
TELL ME WHY YOU THINK YOU WOULD BE

06:57.015 --> 06:58.949
AN ASSET
TO THIS COMPANY.

06:59.017 --> 07:03.270
UH, WELL, DURING MY TENURE WITH
THE METROPOLITAN TRANSIT AUTHORITY,

07:03.338 --> 07:05.005
I LEARNED
TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE,

07:05.073 --> 07:07.508
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S
GIVEN ME THE ABILI-

07:14.533 --> 07:15.800
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:15.868 --> 07:18.536
GIVING YOU A TASTE
OF THE REAL WORLD.

07:20.305 --> 07:22.490
NOW STOP WORRYING
ABOUT MY HAND

07:22.558 --> 07:25.025
AND TELL ME WHERE
YOU SEE YOURSELF

07:25.093 --> 07:26.728
IN 5 YEARS.

07:26.795 --> 07:29.497
WELL, IN 5 YEAR,
I- OH, GOD...

07:34.419 --> 07:36.521
<i>SO, WE'RE SO LOOKING
FORWARD TO HAVING YOU GUYS</i>

07:36.589 --> 07:37.789
COME UP TO THE HOUSE
ON SATURDAY.

07:37.857 --> 07:39.691
I MEAN, THE WEATHER'S
SUPPOSED TO BE GREAT.

07:39.758 --> 07:41.275
I GOTTA BE HONEST.
UNLESS THE WEATHER

07:41.343 --> 07:43.511
AFFECTS
THE CABLE RECEPTION,

07:43.579 --> 07:45.279
IT'S ALL THE SAME TO ME.

07:45.347 --> 07:46.080
NAH, REALLY, MAN,

07:46.231 --> 07:47.631
IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT WORLD UP THERE.

07:47.700 --> 07:49.433
AND WE FOUND THIS AWESOME RESTAURANT.

07:49.501 --> 07:50.717
IT'S A CONVERTED BARN.

07:50.785 --> 07:53.721
MMM-DON'T YOU JUST LOVE IT
WHEN YOU FIND THINGS?

07:53.789 --> 07:55.689
LIKE, YOU EVER JUST
WALK DOWN THE STREET

07:55.758 --> 07:57.925
AND FIND, LIKE,
A BIG BAG OF MONEY?

07:57.993 --> 07:59.143
NEVER HAPPENED TO YOU?

08:00.312 --> 08:01.445
DOES THAT EVER
HAPPEN TO ANYONE?

08:01.513 --> 08:03.181
I DON'T KNOW.

08:03.249 --> 08:04.632
DOES IT?

08:06.985 --> 08:09.703
SO, UH, HOW'S
YOUR RICH UNCLE DOING?

08:09.771 --> 08:11.973
I DON'T HAVE
A RICH UNCLE.

08:13.409 --> 08:15.276
ANYMORE...

08:16.378 --> 08:18.279
'SCUSE ME.

08:18.347 --> 08:20.214
HELLO?
OH, HEY, DENISE.

08:20.282 --> 08:22.049
IS EVERYTHING
OK WITH THE KIDS?

08:22.117 --> 08:23.768
OK-OH...

08:23.835 --> 08:26.270
LISTEN, WE'LL BE HOME
IN 10 MINUTES.

08:26.337 --> 08:27.805
MAJOR HAS ANOTHER
EAR INFECTION.

08:27.873 --> 08:29.324
OH, NO.
MM.

08:29.391 --> 08:30.458
UH, YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD GET THE CHECK.

08:30.526 --> 08:32.159
OH, NO, NO, NO,
WE GOT IT, WE GOT IT.

08:32.227 --> 08:33.844
GET OUT OF HERE-GO.
GO, TAKE CARE OF IT.

08:33.912 --> 08:34.645
THANKS, MAN. ALL RIGHT. THANKS, GUYS.

08:34.712 --> 08:35.730
LATER, GUYS.

08:35.798 --> 08:36.897
JEEZ.

08:39.668 --> 08:41.869
HOPE MAJOR'S OK.

08:41.936 --> 08:43.102
HUH.

08:44.406 --> 08:45.606
WHAT?

08:45.674 --> 08:47.274
YOU SEE WHAT
JUST HAPPENED HERE?

08:47.342 --> 08:48.976
WE'RE PICKING UP THE CHECK.

08:50.712 --> 08:52.013
I THINK THAT
HAPPENS A LOT.

08:52.080 --> 08:53.831
CARRIE,
THEIR KID IS SICK.

08:53.899 --> 08:55.149
WAS HE?

08:55.217 --> 08:57.117
I MEAN, DID WE ACTUALLY HEAR
THE OTHER END OF THE PHONE CALL?

08:57.185 --> 08:58.419
NO, WE DID NOT.

08:58.486 --> 09:00.621
HOW DO WE KNOW THERE'S EVEN
A "DENISE, THE BABYSITTER"?

09:00.689 --> 09:02.857
I MET HER-SHE'S HOT.

09:05.427 --> 09:07.661
AND IT'S NOT JUST
ABOUT PAYING FOR DINNER.

09:07.729 --> 09:09.396
I MEAN, KELLY NEVER
HAS HER WALLET.

09:09.464 --> 09:11.432
I'M ALWAYS BUYING HER
GUM AND MAGAZINES

09:11.499 --> 09:13.468
AND SHE SAYS,
"I'LL CATCH YOU NEXT TIME."

09:13.535 --> 09:16.136
WELL, SHE AIN'T
CAUGHT ME YET.

09:16.204 --> 09:17.572
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT.

09:17.639 --> 09:20.174
YOU KNOW, WHEN DEACON AND I
WENT TO JIMMY'S BACHELOR PARTY,

09:20.242 --> 09:21.576
GUESS WHO LAID OUT THE
MONEY FOR THE STRIPPER

09:21.643 --> 09:24.412
TO DO ALL
THE EXTRA STUFF-ME.

18:35.246 --> 18:36.614
WELL, I DON'T NEED
YOUR WHOLE LIFE STORY.

18:39.751 --> 18:42.753
AND ANYWAY, WE CAN
SAVE IF WE WANTED TO.

18:43.872 --> 18:45.973
THEN...
WHY DIDN'T WE?

18:48.009 --> 18:50.027
WHY DIDN'T WE?

18:50.094 --> 18:52.196
YOU'RE ASKING ME,
"WHY DIDN'T WE?"

18:52.263 --> 18:54.114
ARE YOU SAYING
IT'S MY FAULT?

18:54.182 --> 18:55.832
UH, EXCUSE ME,
BUT I'M NOT THE ONE

18:55.900 --> 18:58.702
<i>WHO INVESTS MY PAYCHECK
IN WHITE CASTLE EVERY NIGHT.</i>

19:00.938 --> 19:03.022
HEY, FIRST OF ALL, I
ALMOST ALWAYS HAVE A COUPON,

19:03.090 --> 19:04.441
WHICH IS MORE THAN YOU
CAN SAY WHEN YOU GO BUY

19:04.509 --> 19:06.843
YOUR FANCY
HALSTON DRESSES!

19:06.911 --> 19:09.846
OK, I DON'T HAVE
ANY HALSTON DRESSES, IDIOT.

19:09.914 --> 19:11.965
IT'S NOT 1979.

19:13.735 --> 19:14.868
I'M GONNA BE
IN THE CAR!

19:14.936 --> 19:18.138
WAIT, I SAW YOU PACKING
SOME PRETTY FANCY CLOTHES

19:18.205 --> 19:19.840
WITH SOME FRUITY LABELS,
AND THAT SPELLS CASH!

19:19.907 --> 19:22.308
<i>YEAH, YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW HOW TO SPELL CASH!</i>

19:24.045 --> 19:27.414
SO WE EVER GONNA TELL THEM
ABOUT THE, UH, BAD BOOB JOB?

19:27.482 --> 19:30.200
UH, HELL NO! WE TAKE THAT TO THE GRAVE!

19:33.170 --> 19:35.439
I MEAN... THEY'RE LOOKING
A LOT BETTER, RIGHT?

19:35.507 --> 19:37.107
OH, YEAH.

19:54.292 --> 19:55.459
MR. GABLE.

19:55.527 --> 19:57.261
WE CHECKED
YOUR RÉSUMÉ.

19:57.328 --> 19:59.829
NONE OF YOUR REFERENCES
HAVE EVER HEARD OF YOU,

19:59.897 --> 20:01.798
AND THAT SOCIAL SECURITY
NUMBER YOU GAVE US

20:01.866 --> 20:03.800
IS THE GAMBLERS
ANONYMOUS HOTLINE.

20:05.170 --> 20:06.703
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO ASK YOU TO LEAVE.

20:06.771 --> 20:08.021
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

20:21.569 --> 20:26.039
SO TELL ME ABOUT YOUR NEW JOB, BIG GUY.

20:28.326 --> 20:30.261
NICE TRY, SPANKY.

20:30.328 --> 20:31.928
I ALREADY GOT FIRED.
