I don't know,

09:01.908 --> 09:03.808

Left her a bunch of messages,

into isolation

09:05.645 --> 09:06.978

Well, now that we have Gray

It'll be 24 hours until we
have a full DNA analysis.

09:16.956 --> 09:18.890
But I spoke to the lab,
and, uh, they're gonna get us

09:18.925 --> 09:21.292
prelim results as soon as they can.
Does it strike you

09:21.327 --> 09:24.162
as odd? The blood? I mean,

09:24.197 --> 09:26.297
Madison Gray's entire M.O.
has been to get

09:26.332 --> 09:27.765
other people to kill for her.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.667
And now she gets
her own hands dirty?

09:29.702 --> 09:31.936
Maybe it's because
her circumstances changed.

09:31.971 --> 09:33.605
As a fugitive, she may
have felt that using

09:33.640 --> 09:35.340
a proxy posed too great a risk.

09:35.375 --> 09:38.076
Yeah, but then she turns
herself in. I don't...

09:38.111 --> 09:39.978
It doesn't make any sense to me.

09:40.013 --> 09:42.013
Where are we at
with the alias?

09:42.048 --> 09:44.682
Kono's working on that.
Seems that Lauren Parker

09:44.717 --> 09:47.085
established residence in a town
called Eagle, Wisconsin,

09:47.120 --> 09:48.019
four months ago.

09:48.055 --> 09:49.921
Right around the time
Gray disappeared.

09:49.956 --> 09:51.856
Mm-hmm. She got herself
a driver's license,

09:51.891 --> 09:52.924
even took out a credit card.

09:52.959 --> 09:55.927
Now, according to, uh,
"Parker's" travel records,

09:55.962 --> 09:58.796
Gray really did arrive on Oahu
two days ago.

09:58.831 --> 10:00.231
We're still trying to figure out
where she's been

10:00.266 --> 10:01.633
since she got here.

10:01.668 --> 10:02.934
Why Wisconsin?

10:02.969 --> 10:05.136
Well, she was trying to lay low.

10:05.171 --> 10:07.972
Eagle only has
about 2,000 residents.

10:08.007 --> 10:09.974
Practically zero chance
that she would be recognized.

10:10.009 --> 10:11.843
There's thousands
of towns like that.

10:11.878 --> 10:14.312
Why'd she choose this one?
Why Eagle?

10:14.347 --> 10:17.181
Every move this woman makes
has a purpose.

10:17.216 --> 10:19.050
Mm.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.654
Looks like they're done
in there.

10:24.991 --> 10:25.957
MAN:
Gentlemen,

10:25.992 --> 10:28.359
I just finished my
evaluation of Ms. Parker.

10:28.394 --> 10:30.028
Doctor, Lauren Parker

10:30.063 --> 10:32.030
is an alias
established by our suspect,

10:32.065 --> 10:33.965
Dr. Madison Gray,
about four months ago.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.167
We're still trying to figure out
for what purpose.

10:36.202 --> 10:38.036
There may be no
criminal purpose.

10:38.071 --> 10:39.404
As far as I can tell,

10:39.439 --> 10:41.339
the woman you have
in custody is suffering

10:41.374 --> 10:43.274
from Dissociative
Identity Disorder,

10:43.309 --> 10:46.978
a condition where multiple
personalities coexist,

10:47.013 --> 10:49.080
each unaware of the actions
of the others.

10:49.115 --> 10:51.049
You do know who she is, right?

10:51.084 --> 10:53.451
Madison Gray is a highly
intelligent serial killer

10:53.486 --> 10:55.386
whose M.O.
is to manipulate people.

10:55.421 --> 10:57.121
And you're implying
that she's manipulating me,

10:57.156 --> 10:59.057
that she's faking her condition?

10:59.092 --> 11:02.126
Doctor, with all due respect,
if anyone can pull it off,

11:02.161 --> 11:03.995
it's her.

11:04.030 --> 11:06.264
Well, I... I certainly
can't rule that out.

11:06.299 --> 11:10.001
But I have researched D.I.D.
extensively.

11:10.036 --> 11:12.904
Studied many patients
who experience it.

11:12.939 --> 11:14.439
And in my professional opinion,

11:14.474 --> 11:17.909
the person in there genuinely
believes she is Lauren Parker,

11:17.944 --> 11:20.745
a tourist from Eagle, Wisconsin.

11:20.780 --> 11:22.880
Thank you very much
for your time today, Doctor.

11:22.915 --> 11:24.082
We'll be in touch.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.387
I guess if that's the case,
she won't have any problem

11:29.422 --> 11:32.056
passing a polygraph.

11:32.091 --> 11:35.059
I'm going to ask some questions.

11:35.094 --> 11:39.797
Please respond truthfully
to the best of your ability.

11:39.832 --> 11:42.066
Okay.

11:42.101 --> 11:43.835
Where are we right now?

11:43.870 --> 11:46.104
In a police station.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.740
Where is that
police station located?

11:50.076 --> 11:51.242
Honolulu.

11:51.277 --> 11:53.111
Or, or did you mean H-Hawaii?

11:53.146 --> 11:54.212
Either is fine.

11:54.247 --> 11:57.248
What is your name?

11:57.283 --> 11:58.850
GRAY:
Lauren Parker.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.151
TECHNICIAN:
Ms. Parker,

12:00.186 --> 12:01.152
have you ever gone

12:01.187 --> 12:03.187
by the name Madison Gray?
No.

12:03.222 --> 12:05.456
TECHNICIAN:
Have you ever worked

12:05.491 --> 12:06.858
as a psychiatrist

12:06.893 --> 12:08.760
for the Hawaii Police Department?
No.

12:08.795 --> 12:10.394
Have you ever
willfully committed

12:10.429 --> 12:12.864
a criminal act?
No.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.298
TECHNICIAN:
Have you ever conspired

12:14.333 --> 12:15.433
to commit murder?

12:15.468 --> 12:17.469
(exhales)
God, no.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.842
DANNY:<i> All right,</i>
<i>so she passed the polygraph.</i>

12:24.877 --> 12:25.943
She's a sociopath,
we knew that.

12:25.978 --> 12:27.545
Why did she turn herself in?

12:27.580 --> 12:29.547
Well, she probably got
tired of running.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.182
She's got to know
it's got to be either us

12:31.217 --> 12:33.351
or some other agency's gonna
catch up with her.

12:33.386 --> 12:35.119
It's only a matter of time.

12:35.154 --> 12:38.422
So she comes in on her own terms
and invents this, uh,

12:38.457 --> 12:40.358
dissociative psychobabble,
whatever it is,

12:40.393 --> 12:42.059
and that paves the way
for an insanity defense.

12:42.094 --> 12:43.260
Makes sense.

12:43.295 --> 12:45.797
We may not be buying this whole
multiple personality act,

12:45.832 --> 12:47.098
but a jury might.

12:47.133 --> 12:48.232
No. I don't buy that.

12:48.267 --> 12:50.902
Because it's still,
it's a huge risk.

12:50.937 --> 12:53.137
And if this risk didn't pay off,
she would spend

12:53.172 --> 12:55.439
the rest of her life
incarcerated in an asylum.

12:55.474 --> 12:58.242
No, no. I don't think
that's the reason she came back.

12:58.277 --> 13:01.212
You know what? I think
she wants something from us.

13:01.247 --> 13:03.981
I think she wants something
from you, specifically.

13:04.016 --> 13:05.283
I think she misses you.

13:05.318 --> 13:07.385
Yeah, that's funny.
I'm not joking.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.921
Think about it. This woman likes
to play games, right?

13:09.956 --> 13:11.923
She, uh, she likes a challenge.

13:11.958 --> 13:14.325
She needs an adversary.
She's still down one

13:14.360 --> 13:16.160
from the last time
you beat her by surviving,

13:16.195 --> 13:17.295
so maybe she wants a rematch.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.462
CHIN:
You're saying that Gray

13:18.497 --> 13:20.031
turned herself in
because she was bored.

13:20.066 --> 13:21.165
Wait a minute.

13:21.201 --> 13:23.167
That wouldn't be the craziest
thing she's ever done.

13:23.202 --> 13:24.969
GROVER:
So the lady wants a rematch.

13:25.004 --> 13:27.138
All right. What's the game
gonna be this time?

13:27.173 --> 13:29.073
That's what we need
to figure out. Hey.

13:29.108 --> 13:30.074
Hey. So I just heard back

13:30.109 --> 13:32.076
about the blood
that we sent over to the lab.

13:32.111 --> 13:33.878
They're still running
a full analysis,

13:33.913 --> 13:37.148
but preliminary results
show that we have...

13:38.284 --> 13:39.317
...partial match
to someone in the system.

13:45.024 --> 13:47.125
Alicia.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.504
(knocking)

14:04.143 --> 14:05.877
Alicia.

14:05.912 --> 14:09.113
It's Steve.

14:09.148 --> 14:11.582
Alicia Brown.

14:11.617 --> 14:13.150
Alicia. Hey.

14:13.185 --> 14:15.486
Alicia, it's Steve.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.188
Alicia?

14:17.223 --> 14:18.422
Alicia, you here?

14:18.457 --> 14:20.959
Alicia.

14:24.964 --> 14:26.163
I haven't found any blood,

14:26.198 --> 14:28.566
and there's no
sign of struggle.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.301
Could be
it didn't happen here.

14:34.440 --> 14:36.441
♪ ♪

14:44.417 --> 14:46.384
Alicia.

14:46.419 --> 14:47.952
(gasps)
Oh, my God.

14:47.987 --> 14:49.620
Steve.

14:49.655 --> 14:51.355
(through earbuds): ♪ You be the
deejay ♪ What are you... ?

14:51.390 --> 14:52.556
♪ And I'll be the driver... ♪

14:52.591 --> 14:54.993
What are you doing here?

14:56.128 --> 14:58.262
Lauren Parker?
Are you kidding?

14:58.297 --> 14:59.530
Afraid not.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.499
Why? This is
obviously a trick.

15:01.534 --> 15:03.467
Well, yes, of course,

15:03.502 --> 15:05.970
and no one is
falling for it for a second.

15:06.005 --> 15:07.571
Yeah, well, she never
thought you would.

15:07.606 --> 15:09.440
She's highly intelligent, and
the last thing she's gonna do

15:09.475 --> 15:11.175
is underestimate her opponent.

15:11.210 --> 15:12.576
GROVER: Well, maybe
she's desperate.

15:12.611 --> 15:15.212
I mean, after all, she's
completely out of her mind.

15:15.247 --> 15:16.414
Yeah.

15:16.449 --> 15:17.648
She's both of those,

15:17.683 --> 15:20.284
which is what makes her
all the more dangerous.

15:20.319 --> 15:21.519
STEVE: Yeah, there's
something else.

15:21.554 --> 15:24.121
When she turned herself in,

15:24.156 --> 15:26.023
she had blood
all over her hands.

15:26.058 --> 15:29.093
It was your blood, Alicia.

15:31.564 --> 15:33.597
What?

15:33.632 --> 15:34.699
A-A-Are you sure?

15:34.734 --> 15:36.100
GROVER:
Pretty sure.

15:36.135 --> 15:38.169
We had it DNA tested.

15:38.204 --> 15:41.005
How is that possible?

15:41.040 --> 15:42.340
H-H-How... I mean,

15:42.375 --> 15:44.308
how did she show up
with my blood on her?

15:44.343 --> 15:45.643
I was thinking it is possible

15:45.678 --> 15:47.679
she collected it
when she attacked us.

15:50.416 --> 15:52.016
GROVER:
Hang on a minute, now.

15:52.051 --> 15:54.051
To plan something
this far in advance,

15:54.086 --> 15:56.687
collecting your blood four months ago...
- STEVE: Lou.

15:56.722 --> 15:58.522
That's exactly the
type of forethought

15:58.557 --> 16:00.591
this woman has shown
she's capable of.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.994
ALICIA: Okay, w-well,
putting aside the how...

16:03.029 --> 16:06.664
Why? Why is she showing
up with my blood on her?

16:08.634 --> 16:10.435
What are you thinking?

16:12.171 --> 16:14.772
Oh, she's obviously
not done with me, yet.

16:14.807 --> 16:18.242
Ms. Brown, I know what
this woman put you through,

16:18.277 --> 16:19.610
but she's locked up now.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.746
She's in jail,
she's not getting out.

16:21.781 --> 16:25.416
You think that because
she's behind bars I'm safe?

16:25.451 --> 16:27.184
Any of us is safe?

16:27.219 --> 16:29.587
She gets other people to do
her killing for her.

16:29.622 --> 16:31.255
STEVE:
Alicia.

16:31.290 --> 16:33.791
If you want a protective detail,
we'll organize that, okay?

16:33.826 --> 16:35.493
You want to relocate
to the mainland,

16:35.528 --> 16:36.594
we'll make that happen.

16:36.629 --> 16:38.662
I want to go and see her.

16:38.697 --> 16:40.331
All due respect,
Ms. Brown,

16:40.366 --> 16:42.666
you really think
that's a good idea?

16:42.701 --> 16:45.102
If there's one thing I've
learned hunting monsters...

16:45.137 --> 16:47.538
you can't outrun 'em.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.241
She's playing another game.

16:50.276 --> 16:53.111
I need to find out
what the rules are.

16:55.781 --> 16:57.648
I'll be fine, Steve.

16:57.683 --> 17:00.051
I'm going in
there with you.

17:03.222 --> 17:04.655
Dr. Gray.

17:04.690 --> 17:05.689
You wanted to see me.

17:05.724 --> 17:07.358
GRAY:
Oh, my God.

17:07.393 --> 17:09.794
That's her. That's the woman
who tried to kill me.

17:09.829 --> 17:11.595
Don't let her near me, please.

17:11.630 --> 17:12.830
(breathing hard)

17:12.865 --> 17:14.598
It's funny you never
mentioned that before.

17:14.633 --> 17:16.067
It's all com...

17:16.102 --> 17:18.836
coming back to me just now,
as I saw her face.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.337
She tried to attack me
this morning.

17:20.372 --> 17:21.672
I had to fend her off
with her own knife

17:21.707 --> 17:23.774
before she ran away.

17:23.809 --> 17:25.076
That's where the blood
came from.

17:25.111 --> 17:27.478
I'm remembering now,
I'm remembering.

17:27.513 --> 17:29.146
You're lying.

17:29.181 --> 17:30.381
She's lying.

17:30.416 --> 17:31.715
(crying):
No.

17:31.750 --> 17:33.150
We're done, here.
Let's go, Alicia.

17:33.185 --> 17:35.352
Come on, come on.

17:35.387 --> 17:37.221
GRAY:
Wait.

17:37.256 --> 17:39.557
I cut her on her forearm,
about midway up.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.659
Her right forearm.

17:41.694 --> 17:42.727
Check it if you
don't believe me.

17:48.300 --> 17:49.800
I went hiking yesterday,

17:49.835 --> 17:50.701
and I slipped

17:50.736 --> 17:52.436
and I cut myself on a rock.

17:52.471 --> 17:54.438
Can anyone ver...
- No, no one can verify that

17:54.473 --> 17:55.873
because I was on my own.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.374
We really should detain her,

17:57.409 --> 17:58.676
a-at least long enough
to take a statement.

17:58.711 --> 17:59.543
STEVE:
No, it's okay, Pua.

17:59.579 --> 18:02.746
I'm gonna talk to
Ms. Brown myself.

18:02.781 --> 18:05.783
I personally guarantee
her cooperation in this.

18:05.818 --> 18:07.218
GRAY (crying): No, you're
not, you're not gonna

18:07.253 --> 18:09.487
just let her walk out of here,
are you?

18:09.522 --> 18:12.356
Let's go, Alicia. GRAY: You can't
let her walk out of here, please.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.135
Did you see that?
She just smiled.

18:24.170 --> 18:26.203
Calm down, calm down.
- And what...

18:26.238 --> 18:28.239
She must have... she must
have seen me on the hike.

18:28.274 --> 18:29.607
She must have
been watching me.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.909
She must have seen me
fall and cut myself.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.511
Alicia.
- Steve, why is she doing it?

18:33.546 --> 18:35.613
Why? If she wanted me dead,

18:35.648 --> 18:37.148
then why didn't she just
have someone kill me?

18:37.183 --> 18:38.282
Because she's
messing with you.

18:38.317 --> 18:39.450
She's trying
to get in your head,

18:39.485 --> 18:41.452
and it's working.
- Oh, God.

18:41.487 --> 18:43.854
You have to stop letting her
get in your head.

18:43.889 --> 18:46.524
We want to figure out what's
going on and what she's up to?

18:46.559 --> 18:48.292
I need you on your game.

18:48.327 --> 18:49.527
Do you understand?

18:49.562 --> 18:51.428
Gray's not going anywhere,

18:51.463 --> 18:53.797
so I'm gonna come by tonight
and we're gonna talk about this.

18:53.832 --> 18:55.733
Okay, well, that's nice
and that's sweet, but I...

18:55.768 --> 18:58.702
I don't need anyone to
look after me, okay?

18:58.737 --> 19:00.738
Fine. I'm still gonna worry,
all right?

19:00.773 --> 19:02.540
So, please,
just do this for me.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.742
Come on.

19:10.516 --> 19:12.283
If I'd known that you
were such a good cook,

19:12.318 --> 19:14.518
I would've asked you
over a long time ago.

19:14.553 --> 19:16.721
Well, slow down,
you haven't tasted it yet.

19:17.957 --> 19:19.790
Seriously, though, Steve.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.860
Thank you.

19:22.895 --> 19:24.261
This is nice.

19:24.296 --> 19:26.564
I'm, uh...

19:26.599 --> 19:28.232
glad that you're here.

19:28.267 --> 19:30.267
Okay. You sound, uh,
you sound surprised.

19:30.302 --> 19:31.669
I am. I mean-- No.

19:31.704 --> 19:32.737
Don't-don't-don't take
it personally, I mean.

19:32.772 --> 19:37.608
No. No. How could I possibly
take that personally?

19:37.643 --> 19:39.577
No, it's just that I'm...

19:39.612 --> 19:42.846
(sighs)
...just used to being alone.

19:42.881 --> 19:45.249
Yeah, well...

19:45.284 --> 19:46.750
You don't have to be.

19:46.785 --> 19:49.387
I can even stay here tonight.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.590
Wow. Whoa.

19:52.625 --> 19:55.259
That's pretty forward of you, Steve.
- No, no, no, no.

19:55.294 --> 19:56.760
I-I'm-- I-I can st--

19:56.795 --> 19:58.495
I would stay on the couch.
I'm so sorry.

19:58.530 --> 20:00.698
(laughing): I know what you mean.
That was nice.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.766
(laughing)
- That's nice.

20:02.801 --> 20:05.236
(laughs): Oh...

20:05.271 --> 20:06.937
(sighs)

20:06.972 --> 20:08.305
I prefer it.

20:08.340 --> 20:09.473
What?

20:09.508 --> 20:10.841
The solitude.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.944
Since my daughter,
and...

20:14.346 --> 20:17.915
...and then my marriage
fell apart, it's-it's easier.

20:17.950 --> 20:21.585
Some days I don't even have
the energy to deal with people.

20:21.620 --> 20:24.288
Yeah. I, uh...

20:24.323 --> 20:25.823
I like my alone time, too.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.559
I thought I could handle it.

20:28.594 --> 20:30.294
I mean, I thought

20:30.329 --> 20:31.862
that I was ready for her.

20:31.897 --> 20:34.365
And then there she was,

20:34.400 --> 20:37.301
and I just...

20:39.872 --> 20:41.872
Alicia, it'll get better.

20:41.907 --> 20:43.741
You know, it's
gonna take time,

20:43.776 --> 20:45.843
but it'll get better.

20:45.878 --> 20:48.812
Yeah, 'cause time heals
all ills, right?

20:48.847 --> 20:51.448
Except it doesn't really.

20:51.483 --> 20:53.917
No, it doesn't,
not all of them.

20:53.952 --> 20:56.620
And this is why I
shouldn't be around people.

20:56.655 --> 20:58.922
Because I bring the mood down.

20:58.957 --> 21:00.591
No, no, don't worry.
I have very low standards

21:00.626 --> 21:02.393
for companionship.

21:02.428 --> 21:04.028
It comes from having
Danny as a partner.

21:04.063 --> 21:05.596
Nice.

21:05.631 --> 21:07.298
You haven't had
to spend eight hours

21:07.333 --> 21:09.433
in a car on a stakeout
with that guy

21:09.468 --> 21:12.303
listening to him complain
about a Reuben sandwich, okay?

21:12.338 --> 21:14.038
Wow, that sounds unpleasant.

21:14.073 --> 21:15.906
Unpleasant is an understatement.

21:15.941 --> 21:17.875
This right here,
this is downright tolerable.

21:17.910 --> 21:19.943
Wow. To tolerable.
To tolerable.

21:19.978 --> 21:22.980
To tolerable. (laughs)
There you go.

21:23.015 --> 21:25.716
(crickets chirping)

21:25.751 --> 21:27.752
(light clatter)

21:43.736 --> 21:45.569
(quietly):
Alicia?

22:08.927 --> 22:10.594
Alicia?

22:10.629 --> 22:11.595
Alicia?

22:22.508 --> 22:24.942
ALICIA:
<i>Thank you for accommodating me</i>

22:24.977 --> 22:27.378
at such short notice, Officer.
- Isn't 4:00 a.m.

22:27.413 --> 22:30.047
an unusual time for
this kind of interview?

22:30.082 --> 22:33.050
Ever heard of catching someone
with their guard down?

22:35.888 --> 22:37.822
I'll be right outside.

22:40.192 --> 22:41.959
No screaming this time?

22:41.994 --> 22:44.828
You're not afraid
of me anymore, hmm?

22:44.863 --> 22:46.797
Well, you should be.
There's no one recording this.

22:46.832 --> 22:50.567
There's no one in the other room watching.
It is just us.

22:50.602 --> 22:52.569
You're not gonna hurt me,
Alicia.

22:52.604 --> 22:54.605
There's a guard
right outside that door,

22:54.640 --> 22:57.641
and they pat you down
before they let you in here.

22:57.676 --> 22:59.877
Yeah. They did.

23:00.679 --> 23:03.580
Just not well enough.

23:03.615 --> 23:05.916
Shall we try this again,
because I don't care

23:05.951 --> 23:08.719
what kind of game it is
you're playing-- it ends now.

23:08.754 --> 23:11.088
You are gonna tell me what
is happening, or I am gonna

23:11.123 --> 23:13.891
slit your throat
right here in this room.

23:15.127 --> 23:16.860
It's not that
easy, Alicia.

23:16.895 --> 23:20.030
It takes a certain type of
person to take someone's life.

23:20.065 --> 23:21.999
I don't know if you
have it in you.

23:22.034 --> 23:24.702
Shall we find out?

23:25.971 --> 23:27.004
(gasps)

23:34.179 --> 23:35.245
(blade clatters on floor)

23:35.280 --> 23:38.816
That's okay, I have
something you<i> can</i> do.

23:38.851 --> 23:40.217
You can unlock
these handcuffs.

23:40.252 --> 23:41.552
Why would I do that?!

23:41.587 --> 23:43.154
'Cause I have a secret.

23:45.257 --> 23:48.992
One that will change
your life forever.

23:49.027 --> 23:52.062
And unless you do
exactly as I ask,

23:52.097 --> 23:54.598
you're never gonna know
what it is.

23:54.633 --> 23:56.200
You're a liar.

23:56.235 --> 23:58.735
That's a verbal reflex
without any real consideration

23:58.770 --> 24:00.771
of my actions.
Think about it.

24:00.806 --> 24:02.206
Why would I go
to all this trouble--

24:02.241 --> 24:03.674
turning myself in,

24:03.709 --> 24:05.709
the blood,
getting you to come to me?

24:05.744 --> 24:07.478
Don't you think
there was a reason?

24:07.513 --> 24:09.847
Last chance, Alicia.

24:09.882 --> 24:13.984
You walk out that door, you're
never gonna know my secret.

24:14.019 --> 24:17.721
(softly): And trust me, you're
gonna want to know my secret.

24:28.100 --> 24:29.099
STEVE:
According to our officer,

24:29.135 --> 24:32.703
right after this,
Alicia made her uncuff Gray,

24:32.738 --> 24:34.705
switch clothes with her,
and then locked her

24:34.740 --> 24:36.607
in Gray's holding room,
and the two of them

24:36.642 --> 24:39.276
walked right out the front door.
Did the officer hear them

24:39.311 --> 24:41.778
say anything about where they were headed?
No, unfortunately not.

24:41.813 --> 24:43.213
We've issued a BOLO
for both women

24:43.248 --> 24:44.748
and Alicia's car,
but nothing yet.

24:44.783 --> 24:46.884
Bottom line is
Gray's gone, again.

24:46.919 --> 24:48.185
Well, anybody track
Alicia's cell phone?

24:48.220 --> 24:49.786
No, we tried,
but it's turned off.

24:49.821 --> 24:52.089
Alicia's too smart for that.

24:52.124 --> 24:55.225
Smart? How could you call her
smart after what she just did?

24:55.260 --> 24:58.095
I guarantee you there is
an explanation for this.

24:58.130 --> 25:00.163
Oh, he guarantees. Good.
You want to throw something out?

25:00.198 --> 25:01.832
Yeah, sure.
Let's start with yesterday.

25:01.867 --> 25:03.867
When Alicia and I
went to see Dr. Gray,

25:03.902 --> 25:05.536
she was provoking Alicia
the whole time.

25:05.571 --> 25:07.104
She was trying
to get in her head.

25:07.139 --> 25:09.306
All right? Obviously,
Alicia took the bait...

25:09.341 --> 25:12.576
You're telling me an ex-FBI
profiler gets mind-gamed

25:12.611 --> 25:14.578
into putting a razor
to a cop's throat?

25:14.613 --> 25:15.812
STEVE: This is Madison
Gray we're talking about.

25:15.847 --> 25:17.014
All right? It's what she does.

25:17.049 --> 25:18.682
She manipulates people.
Yeah, bad people,

25:18.717 --> 25:20.551
crazy people.
Alicia's neither

25:20.586 --> 25:22.686
of those things, all right?
So clearly...

25:22.721 --> 25:25.122
right before this moment
something has happened

25:25.157 --> 25:26.723
in this room-- Gray
has said something,

25:26.758 --> 25:27.891
she has done something
to make Alicia

25:27.926 --> 25:29.726
want to get her out of there.

25:29.761 --> 25:31.895
Like what? What could she have
possibly said? That's the key.

25:31.930 --> 25:34.097
We figure that out, we
figure out where they're headed.

25:34.132 --> 25:36.567
Maybe. Can I talk to you for
one second, please? - Fine.

25:36.602 --> 25:38.735
Kono, let's run
Alicia's credit cards.

25:38.770 --> 25:40.571
See if she made any purchases
over the last two hours.

25:40.606 --> 25:42.006
All right.
- I'll check on the BOLO.

25:43.775 --> 25:45.709
I know that you and
Alicia have history.

25:45.744 --> 25:48.145
You go back, you almost
died together, I get it.

25:48.180 --> 25:49.880
There's a lot there. It's heavy.
- Oh, now you think...

25:49.915 --> 25:52.282
you think that prevents me from
being objective about her, right?

25:52.317 --> 25:54.851
No. No, I-I just think there
are certain possibilities

25:54.886 --> 25:56.052
that we have to consider.

25:56.087 --> 25:58.822
Like what? Like that this
woman, Alicia, just snapped.

25:58.857 --> 26:01.224
Okay? She lost her daughter--
you think you ever get over

26:01.259 --> 26:02.859
something like
that? You don't.

26:02.894 --> 26:03.994
Not to mention, she's been
profiling psychopaths

26:04.029 --> 26:05.762
her entire career.
She's trying to get

26:05.797 --> 26:08.298
into their heads, she's trying
to think like they think.

26:08.333 --> 26:11.234
All right? There is a very thin
line, you know? Danny, please.

26:11.269 --> 26:12.803
I was with her last night.

26:12.838 --> 26:14.671
Uh-huh.
All right? We had dinner.

26:14.706 --> 26:17.207
We talked a lot. She's not crazy.
- Okay,

26:17.242 --> 26:19.643
forget what I just said. You don't
have to be crazy to want revenge.

26:19.678 --> 26:21.111
You think this is about revenge?

26:21.146 --> 26:22.245
It could be.
Maybe that's what

26:22.280 --> 26:23.880
she's been doing,
looking for Gray.

26:23.915 --> 26:25.682
That's why you haven't been able
to get in touch with her

26:25.717 --> 26:26.683
the last four months.

26:26.718 --> 26:27.884
Okay, so what you're saying is

26:27.919 --> 26:30.053
you-you think Alicia
actually did attack Gray

26:30.088 --> 26:31.688
like Gray said she did
yesterday.

26:31.723 --> 26:32.889
It would make sense,
wouldn't it?

26:32.924 --> 26:35.225
I mean, it would explain the
blood, it would explain the cut,

26:35.260 --> 26:36.860
it would potentially explain

26:36.895 --> 26:38.328
why she went in
and broke her out of jail.

26:38.363 --> 26:39.930
Maybe she's taking her somewhere
to kill her, I don't know.

26:39.965 --> 26:41.131
(knocking)
- Yeah.

26:41.166 --> 26:43.901
Come on, we got a hit
on that BOLO.

26:44.870 --> 26:46.937
So, Alicia's car

26:46.972 --> 26:49.039
was spotted at the airport.
The two of them

26:49.074 --> 26:50.874
got on a plane together.

26:50.909 --> 26:51.975
They went to Madison, Wisconsin.

26:52.010 --> 26:54.344
Flight landed 30 minutes ago.
That's all we know.

26:54.379 --> 26:57.748
Wisconsin-- that's where Gray spent the
past four months. Kono, run a search

26:57.783 --> 27:00.017
on Alicia Brown's
background, okay?

27:00.052 --> 27:02.786
Biographical information,
schooling, case info,

27:02.821 --> 27:03.720
everything you can find.

27:03.756 --> 27:05.856
Look for anything that
significantly connects

27:05.891 --> 27:07.024
to Wisconsin.

27:07.059 --> 27:08.726
Okay, running it now.

27:09.828 --> 27:11.928
Edward Sears.

27:11.963 --> 27:14.865
Edward Sears is locked up
in Wisconsin.

27:14.900 --> 27:17.434
That's that serial killer
that Alicia Brown locked up?

27:17.469 --> 27:19.102
Didn't she say
that he was somehow connected

27:19.137 --> 27:19.969
to her daughter's murder?

27:20.005 --> 27:21.805
She was convinced
that he orchestrated

27:21.840 --> 27:24.007
the entire thing
from inside his prison cell.

27:24.042 --> 27:28.378
You! You! You think
you're safe behind there!

27:28.413 --> 27:30.414
You are not safe from me!

27:30.449 --> 27:33.116
What if Madison Gray
relocated to Wisconsin

27:33.151 --> 27:35.085
so she could be close to Sears?

27:35.120 --> 27:36.787
All right. Well,
then the question is, why?

27:36.822 --> 27:39.289
Sears was connected...
to Alicia's daughter's murder,

27:39.324 --> 27:41.825
but did they ever find
the actual killer? No.

27:41.860 --> 27:42.826
No, we did not.

27:42.861 --> 27:44.428
Did they like anybody for it?

27:44.463 --> 27:45.362
Bring up the report, Kono.

27:46.932 --> 27:49.700
KONO: Okay,
so there are no viable suspects.

27:49.735 --> 27:52.169
Looks like the case is cold.
STEVE: Yes, but...

27:52.204 --> 27:54.371
if Sears knew who did it,
Danny...

27:54.406 --> 27:56.073
Gray probably knows
who did it also,

27:56.108 --> 27:57.908
which means they're
not going to see Sears.

27:57.943 --> 27:59.476
GROVER: Gray could have
convinced Alicia that she was

27:59.511 --> 28:02.446
gonna get a chance to confront
her daughter's actual killer.

28:02.481 --> 28:03.414
Which would explain why Alicia

28:03.449 --> 28:05.182
took the chance
of breaking her out of jail.

28:05.217 --> 28:06.216
STEVE: This has got to
be it, the endgame.

28:06.252 --> 28:08.785
I mean, we all know
Madison Gray convinces others

28:08.820 --> 28:10.320
to kill bad people for her.

28:10.355 --> 28:11.988
She's gonna turn Alicia
into a killer.

28:12.023 --> 28:13.890
And we have to catch her
before that happens.

28:13.925 --> 28:16.426
We got to figure out
who killed Sienna Brown.

28:16.461 --> 28:19.362
SEARS:<i> When I heard</i>

28:19.397 --> 28:21.498
a visitor from Hawaii...

28:21.533 --> 28:22.933
I so hoped

28:22.968 --> 28:24.968
it was my old friend,

28:25.003 --> 28:26.336
Alicia Brown.

this old friend,

28:30.142 --> 28:31.875
Dr. Madison Gray--
you might know her

28:31.910 --> 28:32.909
as Lauren Parker.

28:32.944 --> 28:34.311
According to the log,

28:34.346 --> 28:36.947
she visited you here once a week
for the past four months.

28:36.982 --> 28:38.248

Sienna Brown's murder

of your accomplice.

28:48.093 --> 28:50.494
I'm guessing
you gave it to her.

28:50.529 --> 28:52.362
I assume you've
met Dr. Gray.

28:52.397 --> 28:54.331
She can be...

28:54.366 --> 28:56.533
very persuasive.

28:56.568 --> 28:58.802
Well, you know what, we can
be pretty persuasive, too.

28:58.837 --> 29:00.504
So you're gonna need
to give us that name.

29:00.539 --> 29:02.539

can't be any worse

29:02.574 --> 29:04.508

put me through in here.

29:04.543 --> 29:05.976
I don't know about that.

You see, there's only
one way this thing ends,

29:08.580 --> 29:10.547

giving us

29:10.582 --> 29:13.083

29:13.118 --> 29:15.519
Send in paper and a pen.

29:15.554 --> 29:17.821
I'll give you the name.

29:17.856 --> 29:21.358
That piece of paper will be
the evidence I cooperated.

I didn't think that you

40:20.051 --> 40:22.552
That's why you have other people

40:22.587 --> 40:24.020
kill for you--

40:24.055 --> 40:25.588
so that
you can feel

40:27.925 --> 40:29.992
But the truth is...

40:30.027 --> 40:31.928
you just don't have the guts.

40:31.963 --> 40:34.096

don't you?

40:34.131 --> 40:36.466

that was a good game,

40:36.501 --> 40:39.535

of a challenge.

40:39.570 --> 40:41.537
You, on the
other hand--

40:41.572 --> 40:42.972
moral, virtuous,
you've spent your life

40:43.007 --> 40:44.574
putting killers behind bars--

40:44.609 --> 40:46.075
turning you into a killer...

40:46.110 --> 40:48.812
now, that would
really be something.

I'm gonna kill for you?
