WEBVTT

00:00.417 --> 00:01.917
I need you guys to come
to the Snakehole Lounge tonight

00:01.918 --> 00:02.851
to help me with something.

00:03.009 --> 00:04.199
Yeah, no, tonight's not good.

00:04.309 --> 00:05.278
No can do.

00:05.279 --> 00:06.445
I'm on a cleanse.

00:06.513 --> 00:08.147
Please.
This is important.

00:08.215 --> 00:11.817
I'm launching my new high-end,
Kahlua-style liqueur,

00:11.885 --> 00:13.319
"Snakejuice".

00:13.387 --> 00:16.289
Sounds like you took a snake
and twisted it like a rag

00:16.356 --> 00:18.190
until its blood
and guts came out.

00:18.258 --> 00:19.959
Ha ha ha.
Eww.

00:20.027 --> 00:21.260
What does Kahlua-style mean?

00:21.328 --> 00:22.662
I mix a bunch
of alcohol together,

00:22.729 --> 00:24.830
I add some sugar and coffee
and some other junk,

00:24.898 --> 00:26.532
and it kind of tastes
like Kahlua.

00:26.600 --> 00:28.935
I can only drink warm
tap water with cayenne pepper.

00:29.002 --> 00:30.436
Fine.
Then don't drink it.

00:30.504 --> 00:32.271
Just get other people
to drink it, okay?

00:32.339 --> 00:33.673
Meeting in one hour.

00:33.740 --> 00:36.375
If you don't make it,
you're on my done-zo list.

00:36.443 --> 00:38.444
Uh, what's a done-zo list?

00:38.512 --> 00:41.180
It means you and I
are done-zo...

00:41.248 --> 00:43.049
Hanging out, getting food
together, done-zo.

00:43.116 --> 00:44.817
You want to come over to
my house and play video games?

00:44.885 --> 00:46.118
Done-zo.

00:46.186 --> 00:47.820
Hey, tom, you want to come play
putt-putt with me?

00:47.888 --> 00:49.922
No, we're done-zo.

00:49.990 --> 00:52.458
Babe, we got to make
that meeting.

All right, let's start
with the personal stuff.

01:15.148 --> 01:16.582
- How's jessie?
- Who?

01:16.650 --> 01:18.551
- The photographer guy.
- Oh, yeah.

01:18.618 --> 01:20.419
We broke up.
I didn't tell you that?

01:20.487 --> 01:22.788
- Mm-mm! Why? I liked him.
- Yeah, I did too.

01:22.856 --> 01:24.690
I just... I couldn't deal
with his face.

01:24.758 --> 01:26.192
Huh.

01:26.259 --> 01:28.394
Do you think I could get that
book back that I loaned him?

01:28.462 --> 01:31.297
Oh, well, I'm technically
"out of the country."

01:31.365 --> 01:34.400
So I would have to call him
from a weird number.

01:34.468 --> 01:35.801
- Oh.
- Sorry.

01:35.869 --> 01:36.902
Never mind.

01:36.970 --> 01:38.471
But I'm seeing
this new guy, Mattias.

01:38.538 --> 01:41.073
You would love him.
He's a triple pisces.

01:41.141 --> 01:42.908
Uh-oh, looks like someone's
gonna be late for her meeting.

01:42.976 --> 01:44.210
I'll race you.

01:44.277 --> 01:46.012
Really?
Isn't that a little childish?

01:46.079 --> 01:47.780
Oh, ha ha ha.
Bye, Ann.

01:47.848 --> 01:49.315
Sorry, got to go.
Hey, move!

01:49.383 --> 01:50.816
Oh!
Councilman Howser, sorry.

01:50.884 --> 01:52.818
Nice to see you as always.

01:52.886 --> 01:54.754
Bye.

01:54.821 --> 01:56.956
Welcome to
Guerilla Marketing 101.

01:57.024 --> 01:58.958
What is Guerilla Marketing?

01:59.026 --> 02:00.826
A few ordinary schmoes...
no offense...

02:00.894 --> 02:03.429
have a casual conversation
next to some guy

02:03.497 --> 02:05.364
about how great Snakejuice is.

02:05.432 --> 02:07.533
Next thing you know that guy

02:07.601 --> 02:09.134
orders an whole bottle
of Snakejuice,

02:09.202 --> 02:10.536
and he has no idea why.

02:10.604 --> 02:14.874
Ron is going to play our
exciting Snakejuice drinker,

02:14.941 --> 02:17.977
AKA Brian Thunder.

02:18.045 --> 02:19.879
Jerry, you'll be playing
a boring beer drinker.

02:19.946 --> 02:21.213
Your name will be Jerry.

02:21.281 --> 02:25.618
Your talking points are
high-end, VIP, lifestyle.

02:25.685 --> 02:27.453
All right, let's run
through it once.

02:27.521 --> 02:29.288
And action!

02:29.356 --> 02:32.058
"The weather has been
so weird lately.

02:32.125 --> 02:34.126
Hey, let me buy
you all a drink."

02:34.194 --> 02:37.129
"I'll take something basic
like a beer."

02:37.197 --> 02:38.864
"Yeah, I'm pretty...

02:38.932 --> 02:41.100
...boring."

02:41.168 --> 02:43.202
So I'll take a beer, too."

02:43.270 --> 02:46.872
"Not me. I want this night
to get ca-razzy."

02:46.940 --> 02:48.441
Ca-raaazy.

02:48.508 --> 02:51.444
Like crazy.

02:52.511 --> 02:55.181
"I want this night
to get ca-razy.

02:55.248 --> 02:57.016
"Get me a shot of Snakejuice.

02:57.084 --> 02:59.151
I hear it has
a dope aftertaste."

02:59.219 --> 03:00.653
All right,
that's gonna be a cut.

03:00.720 --> 03:03.422
Um, Ron, you got to say it
like you mean it.

03:03.490 --> 03:05.291
I won't publicly endorse
a product

03:05.358 --> 03:08.861
unless I use it exclusively
and I really believe in it.

03:08.929 --> 03:10.596
My only official
recommendations are.

03:10.664 --> 03:12.998
U.S. Army-issued
mustache trimmers,

03:13.066 --> 03:15.968
Morton's Salt,
and the C.R. Laurence Fein

03:16.036 --> 03:19.305
two-inch, axe-style scraper
oscillating knife blade.

03:19.372 --> 03:21.674
We need to find
a new PR Director

03:21.741 --> 03:22.808
for the Health Department.

03:22.876 --> 03:24.443
Dennis Cooper was fired today.

03:24.511 --> 03:26.112
Why?

03:26.179 --> 03:27.713
Short answer...
he went bananas.

03:27.781 --> 03:30.349
Long answer...
his wife, Jan, had an affair,

03:30.417 --> 03:31.951
gave him a venereal disease,

03:32.018 --> 03:33.986
and so he put signs about her
all through City Hall.

03:34.054 --> 03:35.154
I'm sure you've seen them.

03:35.222 --> 03:36.455
Oh, yeah.

03:36.523 --> 03:38.591
"Jan Cooper will give you
chlamydia,

03:38.658 --> 03:40.359
brought to you by
the Pawnee Health Department."

03:40.427 --> 03:43.195
"Chlamydia affects
nearly 100% of Jan Coopers."

03:43.263 --> 03:46.065
"The department of health
congratulates Jan Cooper,

03:46.133 --> 03:47.399
Miss Chlamydia."

03:47.467 --> 03:49.735
"Jan, I love you.
Please come back.

03:49.803 --> 03:52.371
"I realize
that I'm not blameless here.

03:52.439 --> 03:56.108
"Please.

03:56.176 --> 03:57.676
Brought to you
by the Health Department."

03:57.744 --> 04:00.546
"Re-elect Jan Cooper,
Mayor of Whoreville."

04:00.614 --> 04:03.549
Leslie, I want you to help us
choose a replament.

04:03.617 --> 04:05.885
Parks and Health work closely
on outdoor programs

04:05.952 --> 04:07.786
and exercise initiatives.

04:07.854 --> 04:09.054
- Ann should do it.
- Ann Perkins?

04:09.122 --> 04:11.957
Pawnee is looking
for a new PR Director

04:12.025 --> 04:13.325
for the Health Department,
and I submitted your name.

04:13.393 --> 04:16.060
You have an interview tomorrow
at 9:00 A.M.

04:16.129 --> 04:17.730
9:00 A.M. wow.

04:17.797 --> 04:19.331
Yes, I know.
I couldn't get it earlier.

04:19.399 --> 04:20.866
- I'm... I am...
- Grateful.

04:20.934 --> 04:22.301
I know.
You can thank me later.

04:22.369 --> 04:23.736
But first you need
to go over your homework.

04:23.803 --> 04:25.304
These are all
the health initiatives

04:25.372 --> 04:28.307
the city has ever undertaken
since the 1960s.

04:28.375 --> 04:30.342
So you need
to partially memorize that.

04:30.410 --> 04:32.178
And it's gonna be a long night,

04:32.245 --> 04:33.546
so I got you some energy drinks

04:33.613 --> 04:36.048
and some chocolate-covered
espresso beans

04:36.116 --> 04:37.950
and the book <i>Freedom</i>
by Jonathan Franzen.

04:38.018 --> 04:39.118
Why am I reading this?

04:39.186 --> 04:40.519
Because I'm almost
done with it, Ann.

04:40.587 --> 04:42.054
And I want to talk to you
about Patty.

04:42.122 --> 04:44.423
Okay, deep breath.

04:45.759 --> 04:47.526
Okay, I've been a nurse
for over 10 years.

04:47.594 --> 04:49.061
It's not something
you just quit.

04:49.129 --> 04:51.230
I understand.

04:51.298 --> 04:54.266
I just think with this new job,
you could make a difference.

04:54.334 --> 04:56.202
Make real change happen.

04:56.269 --> 04:58.504
Plus, we'd be working
in the same building...

04:58.572 --> 05:01.273
no more lightning-round
catch-up sessions.

05:01.341 --> 05:03.709
It would be nice
to have an office.

05:03.777 --> 05:05.344
And let's be honest,
it would be nice to not have

05:05.412 --> 05:07.046
to pull strange things out
of people's butts every night.

05:07.113 --> 05:09.281
You've mentioned that before.
That doesn't happen that often.

05:09.349 --> 05:10.683
- It happened once.
- Just once.

05:10.750 --> 05:12.585
That already is too many times.

05:12.652 --> 05:15.754
Ugh. I hate talking

05:15.822 --> 05:17.756
to people about things.
This is a nightmare.

05:17.824 --> 05:20.292
Ugh.
I'm grouchy.

05:20.360 --> 05:22.027
Well, we have to support Tom.

05:22.095 --> 05:24.396
Think about it
as role-playing.

05:25.464 --> 05:27.032
That makes it sexy.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.768
- That could be fun.
- Ha! Really?

05:29.836 --> 05:31.870
Can I use a weird voice
and try to freak people out?

05:31.938 --> 05:34.373
- Yes.
- Okay.

05:34.441 --> 05:36.475
Then, uh, next time you see me,

05:36.543 --> 05:39.378
I'll be a stranger.

two times a year.

08:26.713 --> 08:30.315
Cover charge... $5,000.

08:30.383 --> 08:32.051
I can keep going.

08:32.118 --> 08:33.452
How about this, Ron?

08:33.520 --> 08:34.653
Try Snakejuice.

08:34.721 --> 08:37.256
If you like it,
you got to talk it up all night.

08:37.323 --> 08:41.393
If you don't,
I'll shave Jean-Ralphio's head.

08:41.461 --> 08:43.395
Yeah, I'd like to see that.

08:43.462 --> 08:45.664
Hit me.

08:45.732 --> 08:50.302
A lot riding on this.

08:50.370 --> 08:52.604
Damn, if that isn't delicious.

08:52.672 --> 08:54.073
Oh!

08:54.140 --> 08:56.175
♪ "R" to the "o"
to the n-n-n ♪

08:56.242 --> 08:59.445
♪ I say Swanson's got swagger
the size of a Big Ben clock ♪

08:59.512 --> 09:01.046
Dude, you got to end it
on the rhyme.

09:01.114 --> 09:03.649
- I know what I have to do.
- You had it at "Ben."

09:03.717 --> 09:05.284
I know.
I got it.

09:05.351 --> 09:07.152
You think I haven't been
around the world.

09:07.220 --> 09:10.355
I've been everywhere, darling.
I'm a very wealthy woman.

09:10.423 --> 09:12.858
My husband's kept me
in the finest clothes

09:12.926 --> 09:14.460
from Bergdorf Goodman, you see.

09:14.527 --> 09:17.996
- Freeze! FBI!
- No! Leave me alone!

09:18.064 --> 09:20.132
- Hands in the air!
- I didn't kill anybody!

09:20.200 --> 09:21.633
And I didn't burn down
the mill either.

09:21.701 --> 09:22.801
My sister did.

09:22.869 --> 09:24.770
But now she's been eaten
by wolves!

09:26.239 --> 09:29.341
Nothing to see here.

09:29.409 --> 09:31.744
- So how did you two meet?
- We met at the supermarket.

09:31.811 --> 09:33.545
I used my classic pickup line.

09:33.613 --> 09:36.615
If you're looking for douches,
they're in aisle me.

09:36.683 --> 09:38.550
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

09:38.618 --> 09:40.486
Oh, hey, by the way, I don't
think I can get that book back

09:40.553 --> 09:42.054
from, um, what's-his-name.

09:42.122 --> 09:43.422
Oh, that's okay.

09:43.490 --> 09:45.057
I mean, I should've
known better

09:45.125 --> 09:47.025
than to loan something
to one of your boyfriends.

09:47.093 --> 09:48.494
They come and go so fast.

09:48.561 --> 09:50.496
Uh, what
are you saying exactly?

09:50.563 --> 09:51.697
Well, I mean, let's be honest.

09:51.765 --> 09:53.332
How long is it gonna last
with this guy?

09:53.399 --> 09:54.666
Sitting right here.

09:54.734 --> 09:56.168
I don't know.
He's dumb, but he's fun.

09:56.236 --> 09:57.636
Thank you.

09:57.704 --> 09:59.571
I mean, that's the whole point
of dating around

09:59.639 --> 10:01.140
is you get to try on
a bunch of different hats.

10:01.207 --> 10:03.041
Well, this hat is an idiot.

10:03.109 --> 10:04.710
Ha ha.
Classic.

10:04.778 --> 10:07.212
Leslie, are you mad
that I came here?

10:07.280 --> 10:08.814
What? No.

10:08.882 --> 10:10.983
I'm not... are you...
you seem mad at me.

10:11.050 --> 10:12.651
No, I'm not...
I'm not mad at you.

10:12.719 --> 10:14.086
- I'm not mad at you.
- I'm not mad at all.

10:14.154 --> 10:16.989
- Neither am I.
- No.

10:17.056 --> 10:19.358
Looks like you two
need to kiss and make up.

10:19.425 --> 10:20.926
- All right.
- Reow.

10:20.994 --> 10:24.196
Hello.
My name is Ron Swanson.

10:24.264 --> 10:26.765
In general, I try never
to speak with people,

10:26.833 --> 10:29.268
but I have been drinking
this Snakejuice thing,

10:29.302 --> 10:30.569
and it's damn good.

10:30.637 --> 10:32.171
You should buy it.

10:32.238 --> 10:33.806
Yeah, okay.
Thanks, man.

10:33.873 --> 10:36.575
Son, you should know
that my recommendation

10:36.643 --> 10:38.510
is essentially a guarantee.

10:38.578 --> 10:40.379
Drink this, now.

10:42.715 --> 10:45.984
Traegermeister!
You made it.

10:46.052 --> 10:48.987
Yeah, I got your email.
We need to talk.

10:49.055 --> 10:52.357
First off, though,
try a little Snakejuice.

10:52.425 --> 10:53.625
It's 140 proof,

10:53.693 --> 10:55.427
which means it's 70% alcohol.

10:55.495 --> 10:56.762
But don't worry.

10:56.830 --> 10:58.630
There's plenty caffeine in it
to keep you awake.

10:58.698 --> 11:02.668
I believe an ounce of that
would literally kill me.

11:02.735 --> 11:04.837
You emailed everyone
at City Hall

11:04.904 --> 11:06.905
and told them to come to a club

11:06.973 --> 11:10.509
that you own to buy alcohol
that you invented.

11:10.577 --> 11:13.111
Government employees
can't use their power

11:13.179 --> 11:14.780
to enhance
their personal wealth.

11:14.848 --> 11:16.448
I totally get
your point, Chris.

11:16.516 --> 11:17.616
It won't happen again.

11:17.684 --> 11:19.685
I just don't see any way
around it.

11:19.752 --> 11:21.520
You're gonna have to sell
your shares in the Snakehole.

11:21.588 --> 11:22.821
No!

11:22.889 --> 11:24.356
T-pain, this guy
bothering you?

11:24.424 --> 11:26.458
- This is my boss.
- Okay, yeah.

11:26.526 --> 11:27.993
You want me to write a rap
about your name?

11:28.061 --> 11:29.461
Yes.

11:29.529 --> 11:31.296
♪ "B" to the "o"
to the double "s" ♪

11:31.364 --> 11:35.434
♪ do what he say,
and you'll be successful ♪

11:35.501 --> 11:37.369
No offense, but maybe
you think I'm going too fast

11:37.437 --> 11:38.837
'cause you're going too slow
with Ben.

11:38.905 --> 11:41.773
No offense, but I'm going slow
because I might lose my job.

11:41.841 --> 11:43.208
Okay, no offense,
but maybe that's

11:43.276 --> 11:45.244
a little bit of an excuse
for not acting on your feelings.

11:45.311 --> 11:46.678
No offense,
but I don't remember you

11:46.746 --> 11:48.547
having a nursing degree
in feelings.

11:48.615 --> 11:50.249
Offense!
That's rude.

11:50.316 --> 11:51.383
I'm gonna go dance.

11:51.451 --> 11:52.918
Douche, you're up.

11:52.986 --> 11:54.786
Uh, uh.
Mmm.

11:54.854 --> 11:57.256
Hey, are you okay?
I heard yelling.

11:57.323 --> 11:58.957
Yeah, I'm very angry,
and I'm really drunk.

11:59.025 --> 12:02.294
Do you want to dance with me?
Go get me another "snorkjuice."

12:02.362 --> 12:04.429
Oh, that's maybe not
the best idea for you.

12:04.497 --> 12:06.064
Forget it. Jean-Ralphio!

12:06.132 --> 12:07.766
- Yes, I'm here.
- Dance up on me.

12:07.834 --> 12:09.801
Yes, yes, yes.

12:09.869 --> 12:11.336
This is my
first fight with Ann,

12:11.404 --> 12:12.771
and it's a doozy.

12:12.839 --> 12:15.574
But I believe that honest
discussions between friends

12:15.642 --> 12:17.109
can lead to deeper intimacy.

12:17.176 --> 12:19.378
This is a watershed moment
in our relationship,

12:19.445 --> 12:21.013
and it's important
that we fight clean.

12:21.080 --> 12:24.950
All I need to do
is focus and stay calm.

12:25.018 --> 12:27.085
You're stupid, and you're drunk
and you're stupid.

12:28.655 --> 12:31.556
Oh! I don't understand
how this is my fault.

12:31.624 --> 12:33.825
It's not... everything
isn't your fault all the time.

12:33.893 --> 12:35.560
Don't always make everything
your fault.

12:35.628 --> 12:38.330
Good! It's not all my fault.
I'm not the stupid jerk.

12:38.398 --> 12:40.132
I'm not the one who's being
a stupid jerk right now.

12:40.199 --> 12:41.199
I didn't mean it like that.

12:41.267 --> 12:42.634
You know
I didn't mean it like that.

12:42.702 --> 12:44.169
I just meant you were
being stupid,

12:44.237 --> 12:45.671
and you were acting
like a jerk.

12:45.738 --> 12:48.407
Look, I'm sorry that I thought
about you for the job, okay?

12:48.474 --> 12:50.676
But sometimes if I don't push
you in the right direction,

12:50.743 --> 12:52.044
you end up standing still.

12:52.111 --> 12:54.046
I was just trying
to do you a favor.

12:54.113 --> 12:57.115
Enough with your favors, okay?

12:57.183 --> 12:58.884
Stop.

13:02.288 --> 13:05.223
Maybe we shouldn't work
together, then.

13:05.291 --> 13:07.559
Maybe we shouldn't.

13:10.463 --> 13:13.365
Every time I cleanse,
I can literally

13:13.433 --> 13:15.200
feel the toxins leaving my body.

13:15.268 --> 13:17.135
I know!
I feel so much healthier.

13:17.203 --> 13:19.972
I've still got a full week
to go before the broth stage.

13:20.039 --> 13:23.942
Mmm! Pre-broth
is an amazing stage.

13:24.010 --> 13:25.610
It's when you're most alert.

13:25.678 --> 13:27.646
Good. Someone
needs to be alert tonight.

13:27.714 --> 13:30.615
This Snakejuice
is basically rat poison.

13:30.683 --> 13:32.184
Everybody's wasted.

13:32.251 --> 13:34.753
You don't even know one thing.
I didn't even say one thing.

13:34.821 --> 13:36.121
And then she asked me
the whole thing,

13:36.189 --> 13:37.489
and I didn't even do it once.

13:37.557 --> 13:39.524
I'm like an elephant, okay?

13:39.592 --> 13:42.828
If I walk into a room,
it's like, okay, he's in there.

13:43.895 --> 13:47.632
Baba booey.

13:47.700 --> 13:49.401
Turn this music down.

13:49.469 --> 13:54.339
♪ Farts and poop and love
and stuff ♪

13:54.407 --> 13:57.943
♪ macaroni salad ♪

14:05.518 --> 14:06.952
♪ ♪

14:07.020 --> 14:09.354
- Is this everybody?
- Ann took a cab.

14:09.422 --> 14:11.690
Tom's in the trunk.
Jerry's on the roof.

14:11.758 --> 14:13.692
All right, where to first?

14:13.760 --> 14:15.360
Your mother's butt.

14:17.597 --> 14:19.531
I'm so alone.

14:19.599 --> 14:22.034
If even one of you thinks
about dry heaving in my car,

14:22.101 --> 14:23.602
you're all walking home.

14:28.613 --> 14:29.549
Leslie.

14:30.363 --> 14:31.899
I'm here.

14:33.467 --> 14:35.134
We have to go hire
a new PR Director

14:35.202 --> 14:36.402
for the Health Department.

14:36.470 --> 14:38.304
Oh, my God.
I'm so hungover.

14:38.372 --> 14:39.805
I've never been this hungover.

14:39.873 --> 14:42.074
I feel great.
I ran 5k this morning.

14:42.142 --> 14:43.142
Really?

14:43.210 --> 14:45.144
No, I threw up in the shower.

14:45.212 --> 14:47.246
Top of the morning, everyone.

14:47.314 --> 14:50.950
I brought
some burgers and fries.

14:51.018 --> 14:52.118
Eat up.

14:52.185 --> 14:54.487
The protein soaks up the sugar.

14:56.023 --> 14:59.225
First, you take the cow
to the killing floor.

14:59.293 --> 15:02.128
Well, I am out of questions.

15:02.195 --> 15:06.132
Thank you.
We will let you know.

15:06.199 --> 15:08.234
Then our heads will explode,
and we will die.

15:08.302 --> 15:09.969
- Oh, God.
- Oh.

15:10.037 --> 15:12.471
I cannot believe that fight
I had with Ann.

15:12.539 --> 15:14.807
Look, I'm sure you guys
can work it out.

15:14.875 --> 15:17.977
I owe her, like,
a million apologies.

15:18.045 --> 15:20.112
I think I owe you one, too.

15:20.180 --> 15:22.882
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

15:22.950 --> 15:25.351
I don't know.

15:25.419 --> 15:27.019
Are you okay?

15:27.087 --> 15:31.290
No, I'm sad.

15:37.831 --> 15:39.632
- Say, thanks, chum.
- Ugh.

15:39.700 --> 15:41.400
I'll get those papers
delivered for you...

15:41.468 --> 15:43.069
Whatever.

15:43.136 --> 15:45.771
Posthaste.

15:45.839 --> 15:49.075
The doctor says it's probably
not serious, but it might be.

15:49.142 --> 15:52.445
Oh, Kyle, please stop talking.

15:52.512 --> 15:54.480
Why, isn't it Bert Macklin?

15:54.548 --> 15:56.716
What are you doing here,
and who is this sorry Charlie?

15:56.783 --> 15:58.584
I'm Janet Snakehole.

15:58.652 --> 16:00.419
I demand answers,
and I want them now.

16:00.487 --> 16:02.121
Honey, please.
I love you.

16:02.189 --> 16:05.558
No offense, but Bert Macklin
died last night

16:05.626 --> 16:07.827
after the tenth shot
of Snakejuice.

16:09.663 --> 16:14.066
Okay, sorry.

16:14.134 --> 16:16.068
Miss Snakehole.

16:18.238 --> 16:20.239
You think I'd let you
get away that easily?

16:20.307 --> 16:22.775
Bert Macklin may be dead,

16:22.843 --> 16:27.546
but I'm his brother
Kip Hackman.

16:27.614 --> 16:29.949
Why wouldn't you have
his same last name?

16:30.017 --> 16:31.550
Shut up, Kyle.

16:31.618 --> 16:34.286
I know you boosted
those paintings.

16:34.354 --> 16:37.490
Maybe it was me, but I'll
never tell you where they are.

16:37.557 --> 16:39.892
And you'll never have
my body either.

16:45.432 --> 16:46.766
Sorry to hear the news, Tom.

16:46.833 --> 16:48.701
We're gonna miss you
around the club.

16:48.769 --> 16:51.270
Hey, you own shares, too.
Why didn't Chris make you sell?

16:51.338 --> 16:53.039
'Cause Chris doesn't know.

16:53.106 --> 16:54.774
You know what?

16:54.841 --> 16:57.343
Snitches get stitches.

16:57.411 --> 17:00.579
- Donna, come on.
- Don't.

17:00.647 --> 17:01.947
I'm a natural moneymaker.

17:02.015 --> 17:04.550
I got into government
for the connections.

17:04.617 --> 17:07.053
This was supposed to be a thing
that led to the other thing.

17:07.119 --> 17:08.854
It's like when Vin
D <i>boiler room.</i>

17:08.922 --> 17:10.423
That's what lead to him
being <i>XXX</i> and doing <i>Furious.</i>

17:10.490 --> 17:11.757
And <i>Furious.</i>
Yeah, I know.

17:11.825 --> 17:13.526
Listen, I don't like
all this negativity, man.

17:13.593 --> 17:16.896
Why don't you turn that
frizz-own upside-dizz-ity?

17:16.963 --> 17:18.597
Huh?
This sucks, man.

17:21.468 --> 17:23.402
Oh.

17:23.470 --> 17:25.838
You're wearing snow pants.

17:25.906 --> 17:27.272
I got home last night,

17:27.339 --> 17:29.575
and I thought
I might go sledding.

17:31.044 --> 17:32.144
Can I come in?

17:32.212 --> 17:34.180
- Yeah, if you're quiet.
- Okay.

17:36.917 --> 17:38.384
Uh, Leslie doesn't know
I'm here.

17:38.452 --> 17:41.554
Oh, God.
So high school...

17:41.621 --> 17:44.023
I can't believe that Leslie
and I got drunk in a bar

17:44.091 --> 17:45.357
and fought about boys.

17:45.425 --> 17:47.393
We're so much better than that.

17:47.461 --> 17:49.795
I just keep having flashes
of things

17:49.863 --> 17:52.364
that we said to each other.

17:52.432 --> 17:54.834
And she's so important to me.

17:54.901 --> 17:56.736
I feel like such a dick.

17:56.803 --> 17:58.437
I know she feels awful.

17:58.505 --> 18:01.407
I mean, technically, we all do.

18:01.475 --> 18:04.143
Yeah. What the hell
is in Snakejuice...

18:04.211 --> 18:05.377
Demerol?

18:05.445 --> 18:07.379
All I know is
Leslie's always talking

18:07.447 --> 18:10.382
about how lucky she is
to have you as a friend.

18:10.450 --> 18:15.121
And I just wanted you
to know that.

18:15.188 --> 18:17.223
You're nice.

18:17.290 --> 18:19.225
I can see why she likes you.

18:19.292 --> 18:22.061
When did she say...
likes me?

18:22.129 --> 18:23.662
Oh, God.
This is so high school.

18:23.730 --> 18:26.999
Just rent a limo,
ask her to the prom.

18:27.067 --> 18:28.334
I'm sure she'll say yes.

18:28.401 --> 18:30.569
All right.
Thanks.

18:30.637 --> 18:32.838
So let me get this straight.

18:32.906 --> 18:35.174
Tom tries to get off
the Government teat,

18:35.242 --> 18:36.408
and we punish him.

18:36.476 --> 18:38.177
That doesn't make
any sense to me.

18:38.245 --> 18:40.412
I'm sorry.
Rules are rules.

18:40.480 --> 18:42.515
I wish there was something
we could do.

18:42.582 --> 18:44.650
Ben, is there something
we can do?

18:44.718 --> 18:46.185
Damn it.
Ben's not here.

18:46.253 --> 18:47.920
Tom's not scamming anyone.

18:47.988 --> 18:50.256
He's not savvy enough to
manipulate the system like that.

18:50.323 --> 18:53.459
He's just a kid
chasing a goofy dream.

18:53.527 --> 18:57.496
I'm sorry.
My hands are tied.

18:57.564 --> 19:00.099
Jan Cooper was a terrible wife.

19:00.167 --> 19:01.967
I just want everybody
to know that.

19:02.035 --> 19:03.803
Thank you, Dennis.

19:03.870 --> 19:06.338
But we can't give you
your job back.

19:06.406 --> 19:08.874
You sound just like her.

19:08.942 --> 19:10.509
- That was unpleasant.
- Yeah.

19:10.577 --> 19:13.112
All right, who's next?

19:13.180 --> 19:14.213
You came.

19:14.281 --> 19:16.715
Yeah, I had some encouragement.

19:17.783 --> 19:19.952
Your sweater's on inside out.

19:21.020 --> 19:22.288
And backwards.

19:22.355 --> 19:23.856
It's been a tough morning...

19:23.924 --> 19:26.625
lots of regret and shame.

19:26.693 --> 19:29.895
That should be the official
slogan for Snakejuice.

19:29.963 --> 19:32.631
Well, uh,
this committee would like to ask

19:32.699 --> 19:34.366
if you are
the kind of candidate

19:34.434 --> 19:35.935
who could forgive someone

19:36.002 --> 19:38.103
after they've behaved
like a complete jackass?

19:38.171 --> 19:40.506
This candidate could,

19:40.574 --> 19:44.210
especially because
this candidate also behaved

19:44.277 --> 19:45.644
like a total jackass.

19:45.712 --> 19:47.313
Please, don't worry about it.

19:47.380 --> 19:49.114
The committee
totally understands.

19:49.182 --> 19:52.318
Also, I can talk
about my qualifications

19:52.385 --> 19:53.986
for this position.

19:54.054 --> 19:57.656
But first, I am gonna go
throw up in a wastebasket.

19:57.724 --> 19:59.391
Would you mind if I joined you?

19:59.459 --> 20:00.726
Not at all.

20:00.794 --> 20:04.163
Shall we?

20:04.231 --> 20:05.397
Ann came in the next day

20:05.465 --> 20:07.233
and had a second interview
with Chris.

20:07.300 --> 20:09.068
She nailed it, of course.

20:09.135 --> 20:11.237
But she doesn't want
to totally leave her job.

20:11.304 --> 20:13.472
So they struck up a deal.

20:13.540 --> 20:14.940
She works at City Hall
part-time,

20:15.008 --> 20:17.243
and two days a week,
she still gets to be

20:17.310 --> 20:18.644
the greatest nurse
in the world.

20:18.712 --> 20:20.045
Win-win.

20:20.113 --> 20:23.482
We need to remember
what's important in life...

20:23.550 --> 20:26.552
friends, waffles, and work.

20:26.620 --> 20:28.487
Or waffles, friends, work...
it doesn't matter.

20:28.555 --> 20:29.989
But work is third.

20:30.776 --> 20:32.077
So listen, Crazy Ira,
check this out, okay?

20:32.144 --> 20:34.545
I'm at this club last night
just killing it...

20:34.613 --> 20:35.846
the Snakehole Lounge.

20:35.914 --> 20:38.115
Oh, yeah, is that a gay club?

20:38.183 --> 20:40.084
Hello?

20:40.151 --> 20:42.353
Shut up, ass.
Come on, man.

20:42.420 --> 20:47.491
So I'm dancing on the floor
with this super-hot chick.

20:47.559 --> 20:48.993
♪ Me so horny ♪

20:49.060 --> 20:50.961
More like a dude, I bet.

20:51.029 --> 20:52.897
Hello?

20:52.964 --> 20:54.698
Did you wet your whistle?

20:54.766 --> 20:56.033
I wish.

20:56.101 --> 20:57.301
Me likey.

20:57.369 --> 20:58.636
No, no, no, no.

20:58.703 --> 21:00.237
She spent the whole night
talking to her friend,

21:00.305 --> 21:02.773
- arguing about their feelings.
- That's me!

21:02.841 --> 21:04.841
Who knows?
She's probably a lesbian.

21:05.141 --> 21:07.841
They were in the bathrom
a long time.
