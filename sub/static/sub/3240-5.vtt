for smack.

He walked through a partially

Close enough for him
to have been carried.

20:31.063 --> 20:34.966
He was struck by a blunt object
with a sharp, scalloped edge.

Why didn't you tell me
about the dna on raul's ring?

31:15.808 --> 31:18.609
Why the rats in new york city
look so healthy?

31:18.611 --> 31:22.579
Because the weak ones
are eaten up by the strong.
