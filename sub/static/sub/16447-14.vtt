WEBVTT

00:03.755 --> 00:05.288
What's going on with
that woman you're dating?

00:05.290 --> 00:06.256
I broke up with her.

00:06.258 --> 00:07.357
Why?

00:07.359 --> 00:08.925
She said she didn't
want to see me anymore

00:08.927 --> 00:11.828
and I found that insulting.

00:11.830 --> 00:14.364
I thought things were
going well. What happened?

00:14.366 --> 00:16.733
I don't know, she didn't
even give me a reason.

00:16.735 --> 00:18.635
Oh, not a problem, we
can figure this out.

00:18.637 --> 00:23.039
What are the reasons
women reject Raj?

00:23.041 --> 00:25.675
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Can we not play this game?

00:25.677 --> 00:29.112
SHELDON:
Doesn't like games. That's one.

00:29.114 --> 00:30.380
Ignore him.

00:30.382 --> 00:31.915
Yeah, sorry about
the breakup.

00:31.917 --> 00:33.116
That's okay, I'm fine.

00:33.118 --> 00:34.351
SHELDON:
Of course you're fine.

00:34.353 --> 00:37.053
Not every member
of a species finds a mate.

00:37.055 --> 00:39.055
Sir Isaac Newton died a virgin.

00:39.057 --> 00:41.558
Look at the
contributions he made.

00:41.560 --> 00:44.027
I'm not a virgin, Sheldon.

00:44.029 --> 00:47.864
Wha... So now you think you're
better than Isaac Newton? Oh.

00:47.866 --> 00:51.768
No wonder women
don't like you.

00:51.770 --> 00:52.969
You're not being very nice.

00:52.971 --> 00:54.404
SHELDON:
What? He said he was fine.

00:54.406 --> 00:56.606
WOLOWITZ: Sometimes people
say things they don't mean.

00:56.608 --> 00:58.408
SHELDON:
Oh, that's a paradox.

00:58.410 --> 01:00.110
I-If you meant
what you just said,

01:00.112 --> 01:02.913
then that means you may not
have meant what you just said.

01:02.915 --> 01:05.048
Careful, I saw
this on <i>Star Trek.</i>

01:05.050 --> 01:07.284
Smoke's gonna come
out of his ears soon.

01:08.854 --> 01:10.887
Hey.
Hey, boys. How's it going?

01:10.889 --> 01:12.656
Well, I thought we were having
a nice conversation,

01:12.658 --> 01:15.559
but it turns out,
I was being offensive.

01:15.561 --> 01:17.427
So, normal.
Yeah--

01:17.429 --> 01:19.462
(door closes)
Sheldon, what did you do?

01:19.464 --> 01:21.932
We were discussing
Raj's recent breakup

01:21.934 --> 01:24.234
and apparently,
I was insensitive to him.

01:24.236 --> 01:25.869
It's okay, I'm fine.

01:25.871 --> 01:27.270
You Di--
Don't fall for it.

01:27.272 --> 01:29.439
He'll get you to compare him
to a dead virgin,

01:29.441 --> 01:31.508
and suddenly you're the bad guy.

01:32.744 --> 01:34.277
Sheldon, when I said I was fine,

01:34.279 --> 01:36.479
I meant I didn't want
to talk about it anymore.

01:36.481 --> 01:38.481
Then why didn't you say that?

01:38.483 --> 01:40.450
Because that's not
what people do.

01:40.452 --> 01:41.551
Well, I would prefer
if people told me

01:41.553 --> 01:42.886
exactly what is
on their mind.

01:42.888 --> 01:44.387
No. No, you don't,
you really don't.

01:44.389 --> 01:46.590
I actually can't
say "don't" enough.

01:46.592 --> 01:49.292
Well, it certainly
would be easier.

01:49.294 --> 01:51.161
You have no idea what it's like

01:51.163 --> 01:54.064
to struggle
with recognizing emotional cues.

01:54.066 --> 01:55.966
I'm sure it's
extremely frustrating.

01:55.968 --> 01:58.068
Thank you.
And also a little sad.

01:58.070 --> 02:00.270
O-Okay, now you're just
showing off.

02:01.406 --> 02:03.707
You know, I just read
that a team at MIT.

02:03.709 --> 02:06.910
developed a device that helps
people read human emotions.

02:06.912 --> 02:10.213
And you think we can get those
guys to reprogram Sheldon? Cool.

02:11.450 --> 02:14.250
It's supposed to be accurate,
like, 85% of the time.

02:14.252 --> 02:15.785
Wow, I find that
hard to believe.

02:15.787 --> 02:17.787
That a bunch of
awkward scientists

02:17.789 --> 02:19.823
with no social skills
would invent a machine

02:19.825 --> 02:21.057
to do it for them?

02:21.059 --> 02:22.592
I take it back.
I believe it.

02:23.829 --> 02:26.429
You ift's at MIT,
I can make some calls.

02:26.431 --> 02:28.098
Maybe we can
get Sheldon a prototype.

02:28.100 --> 02:29.933
What do you think?

02:29.935 --> 02:33.570
A machine that reads
emotions is intriguing.

02:33.572 --> 02:36.573
It could help me be a
more considerate friend.

02:36.575 --> 02:38.108
Wouldn't that be nice.

02:38.110 --> 02:39.709
It could also help me
identify my enemies,

02:39.711 --> 02:42.946
discover their
fears and then...

02:42.948 --> 02:46.516
I could use those
fears to destroy them.

02:47.719 --> 02:50.654
I like the first one.

03:20.210 --> 03:21.576
Now that Sheldon's
across the hall,

03:21.578 --> 03:23.445
have you decided what
you're doing with his old room?

03:23.447 --> 03:27.048
I was thinking maybe a
library or a gaming room.

03:27.050 --> 03:28.850
You could make it a train room.

03:28.852 --> 03:30.452
I don't like trains.
You like trains.

03:30.454 --> 03:33.188
I know, and Amy says
I can't have a train room.

03:34.524 --> 03:37.425
Sheldon, I just heard
from the guys at MIT

03:37.427 --> 03:39.094
about that emotion reader;
they're sending a prototype

03:39.096 --> 03:40.195
for you to beta test.

03:40.197 --> 03:41.696
(gasps)
Wonderful.

03:41.698 --> 03:43.098
Although I'm not sure
how I feel

03:43.100 --> 03:45.066
about being used
as a guinea pig.

03:45.068 --> 03:48.169
Well, when you get
the machine, you can find out.

03:48.171 --> 03:50.472
Maybe I could use it

03:50.474 --> 03:53.174
to understand why
women keep dumping me.

03:53.176 --> 03:55.443
Oh, you don't need a machine for
that, just send a survey card

03:55.445 --> 03:56.811
to all your ex-girlfriends
and tell them

03:56.813 --> 03:59.547
if they fill it out
they might win a prize.

03:59.549 --> 04:02.217
That's actually not a bad idea.
Maybe I could even

04:02.219 --> 04:05.153
get them all together,
sort of like a... a focus group,

04:05.155 --> 04:06.354
to find out
what's wrong with me.

04:06.356 --> 04:09.357
(chuckles) No, Raj,
that's a terrible idea.

04:09.359 --> 04:10.692
Yeah, I was joking.

04:10.694 --> 04:12.394
You... Really?

04:12.396 --> 04:14.362
Uh, little tip: jokes
are often better

04:14.364 --> 04:17.866
when you end them with "Wocka
Wocka" or "ha-cha-cha."

04:19.935 --> 04:22.570
Hey, great news. The
TV I want will fit

04:22.572 --> 04:24.806
in the gaming room, and if
I leave the curtains open,

04:24.808 --> 04:27.642
I can watch it from work.

04:27.644 --> 04:29.744
Hey, can you hold off
redoing the room?

04:29.746 --> 04:31.813
My brother's
coming out here in a few weeks.

04:31.815 --> 04:34.115
Oh. Yeah. Okay, sure. What's
going on with your brother?

04:34.117 --> 04:36.551
My dad asked if I can get him
a job interview at my work.

04:36.553 --> 04:38.653
Huh. Is that a good idea?

04:38.655 --> 04:40.488
I mean, you think
they'll consider someone

04:40.490 --> 04:42.190
who was in prison
for selling drugs?

04:42.192 --> 04:44.325
Well, I sell pharmaceuticals.

04:44.327 --> 04:48.396
That's just a really hard
to spell word for drugs.

04:48.398 --> 04:50.365
Well, I'm sure he'll appreciate

04:50.367 --> 04:54.702
carrying his samples in a
briefcase instead of his colon.

04:56.072 --> 04:57.939
How long do you think
he'll stay?

04:57.941 --> 05:00.108
I-I'm not sure.
Maybe a few days.

05:00.110 --> 05:02.243
Unless he gets the job,
then who knows?

05:02.245 --> 05:03.912
Hmm. "Who knows?"
That's exciting.

05:03.914 --> 05:05.580
I'll get to wake up
every morning

05:05.582 --> 05:07.649
and see if he's still here.

05:07.651 --> 05:10.452
You don't have a problem
with this, do you?

05:10.454 --> 05:12.353
Of course not. I mean,
he's your brother.

05:12.355 --> 05:14.222
Okay. Thank you,
you're the best. Mm.

05:14.224 --> 05:16.724
Remember that when the
new TV falls off the wall

05:16.726 --> 05:18.560
and crushes us both.

05:20.897 --> 05:22.664
This thing's pretty cool.

05:22.666 --> 05:23.965
It interprets emotions

05:23.967 --> 05:26.968
using a wireless signal
to analyze subtle changes

05:26.970 --> 05:28.570
in breathing and heart rate.

05:28.572 --> 05:30.338
It's amazing a machine
can do that.

05:30.340 --> 05:31.306
Yes.

05:31.308 --> 05:32.640
Now, when the robots rise up,

05:32.642 --> 05:33.942
they'll know that
I've been rooting

05:33.944 --> 05:36.044
for them the whole time.

05:37.013 --> 05:38.913
The display is synced
to your phone.

05:38.915 --> 05:40.482
Give it a try.

05:40.484 --> 05:41.616
All right.

05:41.618 --> 05:43.051
Now, I'm gonna look
at some pictures

05:43.053 --> 05:44.886
to prompt an emotional response,
and we'll see

05:44.888 --> 05:47.322
if the machine
can identify them accurately.

05:47.324 --> 05:48.756
Okay, remember,
it can only detect happy, sad,

05:48.758 --> 05:49.891
angry and excited.

05:49.893 --> 05:51.159
Not other things
you're feeling, like,

05:51.161 --> 05:53.495
"What have I done
with my life?"

05:56.666 --> 05:59.968
Okay, I'm looking
at the first picture.

05:59.970 --> 06:02.804
You are...

06:02.806 --> 06:04.038
happy?

06:04.040 --> 06:06.674
Yes. I'm looking at puppies.

06:06.676 --> 06:09.444
Aw. Somebody's ignoring
their tiny needle teeth,

06:09.446 --> 06:10.812
but all right.

06:11.781 --> 06:13.781
Try another one.
Okay.

06:14.651 --> 06:16.417
What does it say I'm feeling?

06:16.419 --> 06:18.119
Sad.

06:18.121 --> 06:20.588
Yes. I'm looking
at a picture of my grandma.

06:20.590 --> 06:23.825
Oh, that makes sense, 'cause
she's gone and you miss her.

06:23.827 --> 06:25.393
Yes.

06:25.395 --> 06:27.529
And you're worried that
turkey neck is in your future.

06:30.467 --> 06:33.134
What, now, see...
Now it says you're mad.

06:33.136 --> 06:35.570
Make up your mind.

06:38.575 --> 06:39.574
Okay, Emily.

06:39.576 --> 06:40.909
Yeah, sounds great.

06:40.911 --> 06:42.510
(chuckles)
See you then.

06:42.512 --> 06:44.612
Is that Emily
your ex-girlfriend?

06:44.614 --> 06:46.014
Yeah. I'm getting
all my exes

06:46.016 --> 06:47.849
together in order to discuss

06:47.851 --> 06:48.950
why they broke up with me

06:48.952 --> 06:50.885
and how I can be
a better boyfriend.

06:50.887 --> 06:52.353
Oh, God. You went
through with that?

06:52.355 --> 06:53.955
What is wrong with you?

06:53.957 --> 06:55.924
We are going to find out.

06:57.594 --> 06:59.294
Why would you
do that, Raj?

06:59.296 --> 07:01.996
Well, I want information
in order to improve myself.

07:01.998 --> 07:03.665
You're not gonna get
information,

07:03.667 --> 07:06.935
you're just gonna get criticism
that hurts your feelings.

07:06.937 --> 07:08.136
Don't worry, I'm a grown man.

07:08.138 --> 07:09.737
I have a thick skin.

07:09.739 --> 07:10.872
(chuckles):
You're so stupid.

07:10.874 --> 07:12.473
Hey!

07:15.278 --> 07:17.745
Hey, would you take a look
at my brother's résumé?

07:17.747 --> 07:19.380
I'm trying to help
him clean it up a little.

07:19.382 --> 07:20.748
Yeah, sure.

07:22.819 --> 07:25.653
He really worked with
the Drug Enforcement Agency?

07:25.655 --> 07:28.690
He didn't know it
till he was cuffed, but yeah.

07:29.893 --> 07:32.594
Hey, Leonard, if you're happy
and you know it,

07:32.596 --> 07:33.962
no need to clap your hands,

07:33.964 --> 07:38.199
because I have
an emotion detector.

07:38.201 --> 07:39.367
How's it working out?

07:39.369 --> 07:40.602
Surprisingly well.

07:40.604 --> 07:41.936
That's great, I'm happy for you.

07:41.938 --> 07:44.105
No, wait, uh, hold on.

07:44.107 --> 07:46.541
Oh, what, you are.
Aren't you sweet?

07:48.078 --> 07:49.410
What's that? Are you working
on your resume?

07:49.412 --> 07:50.612
No, it's my brother's.
I'm trying

07:50.614 --> 07:52.080
to help him get a job out here.

07:52.082 --> 07:54.816
Oh, ooh! And that makes
Leonard angry.

07:56.086 --> 07:57.719
No, it doesn't.

07:57.721 --> 08:00.488
What, Leonard, please. I know
an angry face when I see it.

08:00.490 --> 08:03.391
It's this red frowny guy
on my phone.

08:04.361 --> 08:06.527
What? Are you really upset
about Randall coming?

08:06.529 --> 08:09.130
No.
Yes.

08:09.132 --> 08:12.033
I said no.
I-It's like you're twins.

08:12.035 --> 08:15.169
Leonard, if you're mad
about this, just tell me.

08:15.171 --> 08:16.838
(sighs)
Fine.

08:16.840 --> 08:19.641
You invited your drug dealer
brother to stay with us

08:19.643 --> 08:22.677
for God knows how long and
didn't bother to ask me first.

08:22.679 --> 08:23.811
He's my brother!

08:23.813 --> 08:25.213
I didn't think
I needed your permission.

08:25.215 --> 08:27.181
Well, hey.
Now she's angry, too.

08:27.183 --> 08:29.751
This thing works
like gangbusters.

08:31.000 --> 08:37.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:38.038 --> 08:40.273
I'm not saying you have
to ask my permission,

08:40.274 --> 08:41.504
but you could have talked
to me about it

08:41.505 --> 08:42.736
before you said it was okay.

08:42.739 --> 08:44.706
Like you talked to me
about your gaming room?

08:44.708 --> 08:46.041
Our gaming room!

08:46.043 --> 08:48.810
I was gonna put
a scented candle in it.

08:48.812 --> 08:51.146
He's still mad.

08:51.148 --> 08:53.048
Stop enjoying their fight.

08:54.384 --> 08:55.617
You first.

08:57.187 --> 08:58.253
If you were this upset,

08:58.255 --> 08:59.854
why didn't you say so
when I told you?

08:59.856 --> 09:02.057
Because I didn't want
to sound like a jerk.

09:02.059 --> 09:03.858
Well, you sound like one now.
I don't see the big deal

09:03.860 --> 09:05.860
if my brother comes
and stays for a while.

09:05.862 --> 09:07.963
If you get him a job,
he's gonna live here forever!

09:07.965 --> 09:09.531
He would get his own place.

09:09.533 --> 09:11.066
Has he ever had his own place?

09:11.068 --> 09:12.000
Yes!

09:12.002 --> 09:13.101
Did it have a metal toilet

09:13.103 --> 09:14.869
next to the bed?

09:15.706 --> 09:17.138
It still counts.

09:17.140 --> 09:19.074
You know, how is this
any different

09:19.076 --> 09:20.909
from you making me
live with Sheldon?

09:20.911 --> 09:21.977
You... Hey!

09:21.979 --> 09:25.046
I shared my Honey Nut
Cheerios with you.

09:26.016 --> 09:28.917
You gave me a bill
at the end of every month.

09:31.021 --> 09:32.220
Stay out of this.

09:32.222 --> 09:33.588
You and your stupid machine
started this fight!

09:33.590 --> 09:35.824
(gasps) You are lucky
that this feelings machine

09:35.826 --> 09:37.892
doesn't have feelings.

09:37.894 --> 09:39.928
Come on, Sheldon,
let's go.

09:39.930 --> 09:42.197
Gladly.
Can we storm out?

09:42.199 --> 09:44.466
I think it loses its impact
if we're chatting about it.

09:44.468 --> 09:45.600
Fine.

09:45.602 --> 09:49.271
I'll just give them the finger.

09:51.508 --> 09:54.009
Okay, first off,

09:54.011 --> 09:57.012
I want to thank you all
so much for coming.

09:57.014 --> 09:59.514
Howard is here to
interpret for Emily,

09:59.516 --> 10:01.983
and to take notes.

10:03.153 --> 10:06.021
No, he doesn't
think it's stupid.

10:06.023 --> 10:09.557
Uh, heads up, both of
you are named Emily,

10:09.559 --> 10:10.892
so we'll call you

10:10.894 --> 10:12.160
"red-headed Emily"

10:12.162 --> 10:13.161
and you,

10:13.163 --> 10:16.564
"red-headed Emily, Junior."

10:20.671 --> 10:22.504
Hey, you went out
with him. I didn't.

10:24.007 --> 10:26.541
Okay, uh, let's get
things started.

10:26.543 --> 10:29.144
Um, why don't we go
around the room,

10:29.146 --> 10:30.412
say your name,

10:30.414 --> 10:32.314
and why you broke up with me.

10:32.316 --> 10:33.348
Want to kick it off?

10:33.350 --> 10:37.218
Oh, okay. Um... I'm Lucy,

10:37.220 --> 10:39.220
and I broke up with Raj

10:39.222 --> 10:41.556
because I have
severe social anxiety,

10:41.558 --> 10:42.724
and he kept trying
to force me

10:42.726 --> 10:45.860
into uncomfortable situations.

10:45.862 --> 10:47.529
Like this one?

10:47.531 --> 10:50.031
Yeah.

10:50.033 --> 10:51.366
I did do that.

10:51.368 --> 10:53.635
I can be insensitive
to other people's boundaries.

10:53.637 --> 10:54.703
Howard, would you
write that down?

10:54.705 --> 10:57.806
Oh... schmuck. Got it.

10:57.808 --> 10:59.107
Uh, next?

10:59.943 --> 11:01.843
Okay. Um...

11:01.845 --> 11:02.877
I'm Claire.

11:02.879 --> 11:04.979
And I guess
I broke up with you

11:04.981 --> 11:07.482
because you were just
really needy.

11:07.484 --> 11:08.750
Also, you were

11:08.752 --> 11:10.652
incredibly vain--
like, all the time you spent

11:10.654 --> 11:12.020
shaping your eyebrows...

11:12.022 --> 11:14.656
Okay, new rule--
everybody only gets one.

11:15.525 --> 11:16.891
Uh, next?

11:16.893 --> 11:19.194
Ooh, I'm not sure
I'm comfortable

11:19.196 --> 11:21.896
sharing details about our
relationship in front of Howard.

11:21.898 --> 11:24.232
Oh. He's here to support me,
so anything you have to say

11:24.234 --> 11:25.734
you can say in
front of him.

11:25.736 --> 11:28.903
Okay. Well, whenever
you and I were in bed...

11:28.905 --> 11:31.072
Howard, get out.

11:31.842 --> 11:33.808
Not a chance.
(chuckles)

11:33.810 --> 11:37.846
So, you were telling us
how Raj was terrible in bed.

11:40.917 --> 11:43.051
Sheldon, dinner's ready.

11:43.053 --> 11:45.487
I made beef loaf, because
I know you're uncomfortable

11:45.489 --> 11:49.324
with the non-specificity
of meat loaf.

11:49.326 --> 11:50.792
Sheldon?

11:54.931 --> 11:56.765
Hey, are you okay?

11:56.767 --> 11:58.266
Not really.

11:58.268 --> 11:59.667
What's going on?

11:59.669 --> 12:01.770
I wish I never tried
that device.

12:01.772 --> 12:02.971
And I know I said

12:02.973 --> 12:04.372
the same thing
after the massage chair,

12:04.374 --> 12:06.408
but this time I mean it.

12:07.477 --> 12:08.676
I'm sorry Leonard and Penny

12:08.678 --> 12:10.044
hurt your feelings.

12:10.046 --> 12:11.880
It's more than that.

12:11.882 --> 12:13.181
It's me.

12:13.183 --> 12:14.616
I always knew

12:14.618 --> 12:16.718
I had trouble recognizing
other people's emotions,

12:16.720 --> 12:19.821
but that machine
just made it so real.

12:20.757 --> 12:21.956
Well, everybody has things

12:21.958 --> 12:23.258
that they need help with.

12:23.260 --> 12:25.794
Like me-- I can't see
without my glasses.

12:25.796 --> 12:28.930
And right now you're just a,
a cute, pink smudge wearing

12:28.932 --> 12:31.232
a childish green smudge.

12:31.234 --> 12:34.903
I thought I was getting better
at it, but clearly I'm not.

12:35.705 --> 12:37.405
Yes, you are.

12:37.407 --> 12:39.107
There have definitely been days

12:39.109 --> 12:41.643
when I was sad
and you could tell.

12:41.645 --> 12:43.711
Yeah, but that's
shooting fish in a barrel.

12:43.713 --> 12:45.447
You're kind of a sad sack.

12:47.951 --> 12:50.051
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have said that.

12:50.053 --> 12:51.352
I'm just upset.

12:51.354 --> 12:53.588
No, see, right there,

12:53.590 --> 12:55.390
you knew you hurt my feelings.

12:55.392 --> 12:56.891
And I'm proud of you--

12:56.893 --> 13:00.528
for reasons I'm sure have
something to do with my father.

13:00.530 --> 13:02.697
And if you don't like

13:02.699 --> 13:05.800
that machine, get rid of it.

13:05.802 --> 13:08.570
Because I love you
exactly the way you are.

13:16.313 --> 13:18.746
I feel the same way about you.

13:20.383 --> 13:21.916
Now, put your glasses back on.

13:21.918 --> 13:23.117
You look weird.

13:27.357 --> 13:29.557
I thought you
were great,

13:29.559 --> 13:31.826
but, oh, my God,
you were

13:31.828 --> 13:33.261
so dominated
by your parents.

13:33.263 --> 13:34.729
EMILY:
Oh, yeah, and that used

13:34.731 --> 13:35.897
to drive me nuts.

13:35.899 --> 13:37.165
He's kind of
a mama's boy.

13:37.167 --> 13:38.666
Kind of?
KOOTHRAPPALI: Whoa, okay!

13:38.668 --> 13:40.235
That's enough.

13:40.237 --> 13:43.171
Write down "loving son."

13:44.341 --> 13:46.341
Can I just say something?

13:46.343 --> 13:47.809
Going out with Raj

13:47.811 --> 13:50.945
was one of the best things
that ever happened to me.

13:50.947 --> 13:53.181
Yes, I'll take you back.

13:55.619 --> 13:57.352
(chuckles):
Let me finish.

13:57.354 --> 13:59.921
It's like I needed
to go through that experience

13:59.923 --> 14:03.258
to know what exactly
I don't want in a man.

14:03.260 --> 14:06.961
Well, that's hard to hear,
but I'll still take you back.

14:07.864 --> 14:09.864
You know, the same
thing happened to me.

14:09.866 --> 14:12.634
After I broke up
with Raj, I met Gary,

14:12.636 --> 14:14.669
who's just amazing.

14:14.671 --> 14:16.404
Sorry, is that "Gary"
with one R or two?

14:16.406 --> 14:18.373
Would you stop writing?!

14:18.375 --> 14:20.942
Just wait. So...
did all of you

14:20.944 --> 14:23.478
go on to better
relationships after me?

14:23.480 --> 14:24.145
Oh, yeah.

14:24.147 --> 14:25.179
Without question.

14:25.181 --> 14:27.382
Little before, actually.

14:30.754 --> 14:32.654
Oh, wow.
(chuckles)

14:32.656 --> 14:34.155
Don't let him get away.

14:34.157 --> 14:35.290
Wait.

14:35.292 --> 14:36.391
What did she say?

14:36.393 --> 14:38.426
Uh, basically,
she traded you

14:38.428 --> 14:40.128
for Bruce Wayne.

14:41.131 --> 14:44.065
(sighs) Okay, maybe we
should just end this.

14:44.067 --> 14:45.700
(sighs)
Wait, hang on.

14:45.702 --> 14:48.369
I just want to point out
to everyone here,

14:48.371 --> 14:51.806
this is a man who
is going to great lengths

14:51.808 --> 14:53.241
to better himself.

14:53.243 --> 14:55.343
Even at the
risk of...

14:55.345 --> 14:56.778
(chuckles):
being humiliated.

14:56.780 --> 14:59.380
And I, for one,
think that's very brave.

14:59.382 --> 15:00.949
Thank you, Howard.

15:00.951 --> 15:04.686
Honestly, I'm surprised
you two didn't wind up together.

15:06.957 --> 15:09.958
Well, like you gals,
I had to suffer through him

15:09.960 --> 15:11.759
to find Bernadette.

15:12.596 --> 15:14.796
(goofy voice):
With it were you.

15:17.300 --> 15:19.367
Yes?

15:19.369 --> 15:21.436
We owe you an apology.

15:21.438 --> 15:24.105
Oh, it's fine.
You needed a suitcase,

15:24.107 --> 15:26.608
I wasn't home,
you borrowed a suitcase.

15:26.610 --> 15:30.011
That was six years ago.
I'm talking about tonight.

15:30.013 --> 15:31.212
Oh.

15:31.214 --> 15:33.948
Well, I thought
we were going in order.

15:35.952 --> 15:37.285
Look, we got really angry
at each other, and you

15:37.287 --> 15:38.686
just got caught in
the middle of it.

15:38.688 --> 15:39.520
LEONARD:
And...

15:39.522 --> 15:41.089
sorry about the suitcase.

15:41.091 --> 15:42.090
Yeah, well, you should be.

15:42.092 --> 15:43.157
Your socks were still in it.

15:43.159 --> 15:44.659
I had to throw it away.

15:44.661 --> 15:46.494
Anyway,

15:46.496 --> 15:48.029
I, uh, trust that you've
resolved your conflict.

15:48.031 --> 15:49.964
Yes, we're fine.

15:49.966 --> 15:51.466
Mm, Penny's gonna call her dad
and tell him it's not

15:51.468 --> 15:52.867
a good time
for Randall to visit.

15:52.869 --> 15:54.402
Hopefully, he won't
be too upset.

15:54.404 --> 15:57.171
Oh, you're his little girl--
he can't stay mad at you.

15:57.173 --> 15:59.574
He won't be mad at me.
I mean, you're the one

15:59.576 --> 16:01.876
who doesn't want my
brother to come, so...

16:01.878 --> 16:04.879
So you're gonna throw me
under the bus?

16:04.881 --> 16:06.514
Oh, I'm gonna
throw you so hard,

16:06.516 --> 16:09.550
I might actually win
a stuffed animal.

16:11.488 --> 16:14.489
Uh, guys, it sounds like
you're getting angry again.

16:14.491 --> 16:15.657
That's because we are.

16:15.659 --> 16:16.724
Yes!

16:16.726 --> 16:17.992
I don't need
an emotion machine!

16:17.994 --> 16:19.427
I am one!

16:23.566 --> 16:25.400
Thanks, ladies!
This was fun!

16:25.402 --> 16:29.337
Let's not wait so long for
another bizarre, awkward night.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.206
Well, that was a waste of time.

16:32.208 --> 16:33.608
I'm such an idiot.

16:33.610 --> 16:34.776
Don't beat yourself up.

16:34.778 --> 16:36.611
That's what I'm here for.

16:36.613 --> 16:37.879
Maybe I won't settle down.

16:37.881 --> 16:39.514
Maybe I'll just
play the field.

16:39.516 --> 16:41.149
Yeah, the field
was just here.

16:41.151 --> 16:43.084
The field said no.

16:44.454 --> 16:46.220
Dude, come on.

16:46.222 --> 16:47.789
(sighs)
Okay, I'll tell you what.

16:47.791 --> 16:49.023
I'll make you a deal.

16:49.025 --> 16:51.025
30 years from now,
if you're still single

16:51.027 --> 16:53.361
and things don't work out
with me and Bernadette...

16:53.363 --> 16:56.364
you and I can give it a go.

16:56.366 --> 16:58.566
I appreciate the offer,
but if things don't work out

16:58.568 --> 17:01.202
with you two, I'm swooping in
on her like a vulture.

17:02.038 --> 17:04.906
Too late.
Stuart called dibs.

17:04.907 --> 17:07.942
But theoretically,
if you and I

17:07.944 --> 17:10.044
were in a gay relationship,

17:10.046 --> 17:11.746
how would we tell people?

17:11.748 --> 17:13.981
Like, print up announcements?

17:13.983 --> 17:16.784
(chuckles) I don't know.
What difference does it make?

17:16.786 --> 17:19.353
Well, I want to make sure we
get invited to all the parades.

17:19.355 --> 17:21.756
Those do look fun.

17:21.758 --> 17:24.659
Yeah. Well, if you want
to march in a fishnet crop top,

17:24.661 --> 17:26.961
you better lay off
that dip.

17:26.963 --> 17:28.329
If you didn't want me to eat it,

17:28.330 --> 17:30.064
why'd you put it out?
It was for the girls.

17:30.066 --> 17:32.667
They broke up with me--
I don't care if they get fat.

17:33.636 --> 17:35.303
I'm not gonna get fat.

17:35.305 --> 17:38.573
Oh, you want to bet?
You never exercise.

17:38.575 --> 17:41.576
Fine. Look, I'll
exercise right now.

17:41.578 --> 17:44.445
(strained grunting):
One...

17:44.447 --> 17:46.347
two...

17:46.349 --> 17:47.782
(crunching)

17:47.784 --> 17:49.016
These are crunches, by the way.

17:49.018 --> 17:50.184
Very mature.

17:50.186 --> 17:51.219
Keep eating like that.

17:51.221 --> 17:52.186
You're gonna have
a heart attack.

17:52.188 --> 17:54.922
Okay. How about
if I eat like this?

17:56.493 --> 17:58.059
Mmm...

17:58.061 --> 18:00.528
(laughing):
You're such a child.

18:00.530 --> 18:03.531
Hey, is that any way to talk
to your future husband?

18:03.533 --> 18:04.932
Hey, I was being
hypothetical, okay?

18:04.934 --> 18:07.101
I would never marry you.
Please.

18:07.103 --> 18:08.803
When you see the ring I pick
out, you're gonna melt.

18:08.805 --> 18:09.804
Yeah, right.

18:09.806 --> 18:11.172
Wait, is it rose gold?

18:11.174 --> 18:13.708
Actually, don't tell me.
I want to be surprised.

18:23.416 --> 18:25.749
So, did you wind up sending
that machine back?

18:25.752 --> 18:28.352
I did. You know, I'm not
even sure how accurate it was.

18:28.354 --> 18:32.022
I took it to the train store--
it said everyone was sad.

18:34.293 --> 18:35.826
I finally
got Halley to sleep.

18:35.828 --> 18:38.028
You know, I just read
a study that suggests

18:38.030 --> 18:40.130
new mothers are better
at sensing emotions

18:40.132 --> 18:41.432
for up to two years.

18:41.434 --> 18:42.366
AMY:
It's true.

18:42.368 --> 18:44.234
Pregnancy causes
physiological changes

18:44.236 --> 18:46.570
in the brain that result
in increased empathy.

18:46.572 --> 18:48.872
all we need to do
is get Sheldon knocked up.

18:50.309 --> 18:53.410
We can't. He was already fixed
when I found him at the shelter.

18:54.480 --> 18:56.447
Hey, uh, Bernadette,
let's test this theory.

18:56.449 --> 18:58.882
What do you think
I'm feeling right now?

18:58.884 --> 19:00.384
Let's see.

19:00.386 --> 19:03.420
You're better than us,
a little bit sorry for us,

19:03.422 --> 19:07.491
but mostly glad
you don't have to be us.

19:09.495 --> 19:11.295
Keep filling this one
with babies. She's good.
