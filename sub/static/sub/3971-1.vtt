00:51.800 --> 00:53.480
<i>Do you ever look
at someone and wonder...</i>

00:53.520 --> 00:55.949
<i>"What is going on inside their head?"</i>

00:56.320 --> 00:59.704
<i>Well, I know. Well, I know Riley's head.</i>

01:35.641 --> 01:36.943
Hmm?

01:44.521 --> 01:46.904
<i>And there she was...</i>

01:48.121 --> 01:49.833
Hello.

01:51.161 --> 01:52.801
Riley.

01:52.841 --> 01:56.826
Oh, look at you.
Aren't you a little bundle of joy?

02:07.922 --> 02:10.066
Aren't you a little bundle of joy?

02:10.722 --> 02:12.263
Whoa.

02:30.242 --> 02:35.026
<i>It was amazing.
Just Riley and me. Forever.</i>

02:41.403 --> 02:43.786
<i>Er, for 33 seconds?</i>

02:45.923 --> 02:47.523
I'm Sadness.

02:47.563 --> 02:51.152
Oh, hello. I... I'm Joy. So...

02:51.683 --> 02:55.069
Can I just... If you could...
I just want to fix that. Thanks.

02:55.443 --> 02:57.243
<i>And that was just the beginning.</i>

02:57.283 --> 02:59.791
<i>Headquarters only got
more crowded from there.</i>

03:02.083 --> 03:05.123
Very nice. Okay, looks like
you got this. Very good.

03:05.163 --> 03:06.843
Whoa, sharp turn!
No! Look out! No!

03:06.883 --> 03:10.352
<i>That's Fear.
He's really good at keeping Riley safe.</i>

03:10.603 --> 03:14.193
<i>Easy, easy. Ah!
Oh, we're good. We're good.</i>

03:15.123 --> 03:16.563
- Whew! Good job.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

03:16.603 --> 03:18.083
And we're back!

03:18.123 --> 03:20.426
Oh!

03:22.723 --> 03:24.324
Here we go. All right, open.

03:24.364 --> 03:26.044
- Hmm. This looks new.
- You think it's safe?

03:26.084 --> 03:27.364
- What is it?
- Aah.

03:27.404 --> 03:30.124
Okay, caution.
There is a dangerous smell, people.

03:30.164 --> 03:32.284
- Hold on. What is that?
<i>- This is Disgust.</i>

03:32.324 --> 03:35.004
<i>She basically keeps Riley
from being poisoned.</i>

03:35.044 --> 03:36.320
<i>Physically and socially.</i>

03:36.360 --> 03:38.440
That is not brightly colored
or shaped like a dinosaur.

03:38.480 --> 03:39.524
Hold on, guys.

03:39.564 --> 03:40.844
It's broccoli!

03:40.884 --> 03:42.186
Yucky!

03:43.804 --> 03:45.324
Well, I just saved our lives.

03:45.364 --> 03:46.604
- Whew!
- Yeah. You're welcome.

03:46.644 --> 03:49.524
Riley, if you don't eat your dinner,
you're not gonna get any dessert.

03:49.564 --> 03:51.964
Wait. Did he just say
we couldn't have dessert?

03:52.004 --> 03:53.164
<i>That's Anger.</i>

03:53.204 --> 03:56.364
<i>He cares very deeply
about things being fair.</i>

03:56.404 --> 03:58.284
So that's how you
want to play it, old man?

03:58.324 --> 04:01.444
No dessert? Oh, sure,
we'll eat our dinner!

04:01.484 --> 04:03.753
Right after you eat this!

04:06.884 --> 04:09.587
Riley, Riley, here comes an airplane!

04:10.845 --> 04:13.285
Oh, airplane.
We got an airplane, everybody.

04:13.325 --> 04:14.787
- Oh!
- Airplane.

04:23.445 --> 04:27.034
<i>And you've met Sadness.
She... Well, she...</i>

04:31.245 --> 04:33.005
<i>I'm not actually sure
what she does.</i>

04:33.045 --> 04:34.325
<i>And I've checked,</i>

04:34.365 --> 04:35.685
<i>there's no place for her to go, so...</i>

04:35.725 --> 04:38.506
<i>She's good, we're good. It's all great!</i>

04:38.885 --> 04:40.845
<i>Anyway, these are Riley's memories</i>

04:40.885 --> 04:43.045
<i>and they're mostly happy,
you'll notice. Not to brag.</i>

04:43.085 --> 04:44.911
Whoo-hoo!

04:45.925 --> 04:47.307
Whoo-hoo!

04:48.725 --> 04:50.950
<i>But the really important ones
are over here.</i>

04:51.126 --> 04:52.526
<i>I don't want to get too technical,</i>

04:52.566 --> 04:54.949
<i>but these are called Core Memories.</i>

04:55.086 --> 04:58.366
<i>Each one came from
a super important time in Riley's life.</i>

04:58.406 --> 05:00.126
<i>Uh, like when she first scored a goal.</i>

05:00.166 --> 05:01.686
<i>Oh, that was so amazing!</i>

05:01.726 --> 05:04.366
Hey! Would you look at that? Very nice!

05:04.406 --> 05:06.347
- We got a future center here!
- Nice job.

05:18.566 --> 05:19.886
<i>And each Core Memory</i>

05:19.926 --> 05:22.753
<i>powers a different aspect
of Riley's personality.</i>

05:22.926 --> 05:25.116
<i>Like Hockey Island.</i>

05:27.206 --> 05:29.589
<i>Goofball Island is my personal favorite.</i>

05:29.806 --> 05:32.109
Ah, come back here, you little monkey!

05:33.006 --> 05:34.927
Oh, you're silly.

05:34.967 --> 05:37.032
<i>Yep, Goofball is the best.</i>

05:37.167 --> 05:39.436
<i>Friendship Island is pretty good too.</i>

05:41.887 --> 05:44.367
<i>Oh, I love Honesty Island.</i>

05:44.407 --> 05:45.709
<i>And that's the truth!</i>

05:45.927 --> 05:48.230
<i>And of course,
Family Island is amazing.</i>

05:50.407 --> 05:52.687
<i>The point is,
the Islands of Personality</i>

05:52.727 --> 05:55.047
<i>are what make Riley... Riley!</i>

05:55.087 --> 05:57.595
Look out, mermaid!

06:03.127 --> 06:04.918
Lava! Whee!

06:06.487 --> 06:08.327
<i>♪ Who's your friend who likes to play?</i>

06:08.367 --> 06:10.318
<i>♪ Bing Bong, Bing Bong! ♪</i>

06:10.687 --> 06:12.752
- Hey! Very nice!
- Where'd you learn that?

06:15.607 --> 06:17.728
Ahhh!

06:17.768 --> 06:21.118
Brain freeze!

06:24.408 --> 06:26.837
Yeah!

06:30.088 --> 06:31.288
Good night, kiddo.

06:31.328 --> 06:32.676
Good night, Dad.

06:37.568 --> 06:40.634
And... we're out!

06:41.408 --> 06:42.688
That's what I'm talking about!

06:42.728 --> 06:44.248
Whoo! Another perfect day!

06:44.288 --> 06:45.488
Nice job, everybody!

06:45.528 --> 06:47.509
Let's get those memories
down to Long Term.

06:52.488 --> 06:54.248
All right, we did not die today!

06:54.288 --> 06:56.318
I call that an unqualified success.

07:11.969 --> 07:14.489
<i>And that's it. We love our girl.</i>

07:14.529 --> 07:16.753
<i>She's got great friends
and a great house.</i>

07:16.849 --> 07:18.515
<i>Things couldn't be better.</i>

07:18.889 --> 07:20.999
<i>After all, Riley's 11 now.</i>

07:21.529 --> 07:22.831
<i>What could happen?</i>

07:24.209 --> 07:25.591
- What...
- Aah!

07:30.129 --> 07:32.353
Okay, not what I had in mind.

07:56.890 --> 07:58.850
Hey, look!
The Golden Gate Bridge!

07:58.890 --> 08:00.050
Isn't that great?

08:00.090 --> 08:02.370
It's not made out of
solid gold like we thought,

08:02.410 --> 08:04.210
which is kind of
a disappointment, but still...

08:04.250 --> 08:06.890
I sure am glad you told me
earthquakes are a myth, Joy.

08:06.930 --> 08:09.210
Otherwise I'd be terrified right now!

08:09.250 --> 08:10.916
Uh, yeah...

08:10.970 --> 08:12.010
Are you kidding?
Get out of the street!

08:12.050 --> 08:13.370
Oh, for Pete's sake! Move it!

08:13.410 --> 08:15.713
These are my kind of people.

08:15.770 --> 08:17.370
All right, just a few more blocks.

08:17.410 --> 08:18.730
We're almost to our new house!

08:18.770 --> 08:19.890
Step on it, Daddy!

08:19.930 --> 08:21.210
Why don't we just live in this smelly car?

08:21.250 --> 08:22.730
We've already been in it forever.

08:22.770 --> 08:24.610
Which, actually, was really lucky,

08:24.650 --> 08:26.290
because that gave us
plenty of time to think about

08:26.330 --> 08:28.611
what our new house is going to look like!

08:28.651 --> 08:31.159
What! Let's review
the top five daydreams.

08:31.451 --> 08:33.211
- Ooh! That looks safe!
- That one's nice.

08:33.251 --> 08:34.691
Oh, this will be great for Riley!

08:34.731 --> 08:36.010
Oh, no, no, no, no, this one!

08:36.051 --> 08:38.131
Oh, Joy, for the last time,
she cannot live in a cookie.

08:38.171 --> 08:40.440
That's the one!
It comes with a dragon.

08:41.770 --> 08:43.792
Now we're getting close,
I can feel it.

08:44.851 --> 08:47.075
Here it is, here's our new house.

08:47.291 --> 08:48.593
And...

08:54.451 --> 08:56.675
Maybe it's nice on the inside.

09:02.091 --> 09:03.931
- We're supposed to live here?
- Do we have to?

09:03.971 --> 09:05.971
I'm telling you,
it smells like something died in here.

09:06.011 --> 09:07.131
Can you die from moving?

09:07.171 --> 09:08.651
Guys, you're overreacting.

09:08.691 --> 09:10.091
Nobody is dying...

09:10.131 --> 09:11.212
A dead mouse!

09:11.252 --> 09:13.092
- Great. This is just great.
- I'm gonna be sick.

09:13.132 --> 09:14.612
It's the house of the dead!
We're going to get rabies!

09:14.652 --> 09:16.172
Get off of me!

09:16.212 --> 09:17.532
Hey. All through the drive,

09:17.572 --> 09:19.492
Dad talked about
how cool our new room is.

09:19.532 --> 09:20.652
Let's go check it out!

09:20.692 --> 09:21.772
- Let's go!
- It's gonna be great!

09:21.812 --> 09:23.114
Yes, yes, yes.

09:23.172 --> 09:24.172
No, no, no, no, no.

09:24.212 --> 09:25.532
I'm starting
to envy the dead mouse.

09:25.572 --> 09:26.612
Get out the rubber ball,

09:26.652 --> 09:28.012
we're in solitary confinement.

09:28.052 --> 09:29.092
Riley can't live here.

09:29.132 --> 09:30.172
- She's right.
- It's the worst.

09:30.212 --> 09:31.652
- Really bad.
- It's absolutely the worst.

09:31.692 --> 09:34.292
It's the worst place
I've ever been in my entire life.

09:34.332 --> 09:36.972
Hey, it's nothing
our butterfly curtains couldn't fix.

09:37.012 --> 09:39.252
I read somewhere
that an empty room is an opportunity.

09:39.292 --> 09:40.772
- Where did you read that?
- It doesn't matter.

09:40.812 --> 09:41.812
I read it and it's great.

09:41.852 --> 09:42.972
We'll put the bed there.

09:43.012 --> 09:44.132
And the desk over there.

09:44.172 --> 09:45.452
The hockey lamp goes there.

09:45.492 --> 09:46.492
Uh, put the chair there.

09:46.532 --> 09:48.052
The trophy collection goes there.

09:48.092 --> 09:49.732
Stars! I like that!

09:49.772 --> 09:50.972
Now we're talking!

09:51.012 --> 09:52.993
Let's go get our stuff
from the moving van!

09:53.212 --> 09:54.653
All right. Goodbye.

09:54.693 --> 09:55.733
Well, guess what?

09:55.773 --> 09:57.493
The moving van
won't be here until Thursday.

09:57.533 --> 09:59.013
- You're kidding.
- Mmm-hmm.

09:59.053 --> 10:01.373
The van is lost? It is the worst day ever!

10:01.413 --> 10:03.213
That figures. The van is lost.

10:03.253 --> 10:04.573
You said it would be here yesterday!

10:04.613 --> 10:05.973
I know that's what I said.
That's what they told me!

10:06.013 --> 10:07.213
Mom and Dad are stressed out!

10:07.253 --> 10:09.053
- They're stressed out?
- What are we going to do?

10:09.093 --> 10:11.874
I've got a great idea!

10:12.613 --> 10:14.493
Did you even read the contract?

10:14.533 --> 10:16.933
Andersen makes her move.
She's closing in!

10:16.973 --> 10:18.013
Hey!

10:18.053 --> 10:19.133
Oh, no, you're not!

10:19.173 --> 10:20.253
She's lining up for the shot!

10:20.293 --> 10:21.333
Coming behind you.

10:21.373 --> 10:23.213
- Watch out! Watch out!
- She shoots and she scores!

10:23.253 --> 10:25.124
Yeah!

10:25.893 --> 10:28.173
- Come on, Grandma!
- Ha!

10:28.213 --> 10:29.213
"Grandma"?

10:29.253 --> 10:31.318
Uh-oh, she put her hair up,
we're in for it!

10:31.413 --> 10:32.693
Whoo!

10:32.733 --> 10:34.843
Hey, put me down!

10:37.894 --> 10:39.614
Ah! Sorry.

10:39.654 --> 10:41.002
Hold on. Hold on.

10:41.574 --> 10:43.694
- Hello?
- Wait. Wh...

10:43.734 --> 10:45.161
You're kidding.

10:45.774 --> 10:47.374
All right. Stall for me.

10:47.414 --> 10:48.716
I'll be right there.

10:48.894 --> 10:50.414
The investor's supposed
to show up on Thursday,

10:50.454 --> 10:51.694
not today!

10:51.734 --> 10:53.214
I got to go.

10:53.254 --> 10:54.694
It's okay. We get it.

10:54.734 --> 10:56.241
You're the best. Thanks, hon.

10:56.654 --> 10:58.195
See you, sweetie.

10:59.094 --> 11:00.374
Dad just left us.

11:00.414 --> 11:02.054
He doesn't love us anymore.

11:02.094 --> 11:03.374
That's sad.

11:03.414 --> 11:05.205
I should drive, right?

11:05.414 --> 11:06.762
Joy?

11:07.094 --> 11:08.374
What are you doing?

11:08.414 --> 11:10.174
Uh, just give me one second.

11:10.214 --> 11:12.294
Um, you know what I've realized?

11:12.334 --> 11:14.876
Riley hasn't had lunch! Remember?

11:17.174 --> 11:19.654
Hey, I saw a pizza place down the street.

11:19.694 --> 11:20.814
Maybe we could try that?

11:20.854 --> 11:22.255
Pizza sounds delicious.

11:22.295 --> 11:24.166
- Pizza? That's good.
- Yes! Pizza!

11:26.375 --> 11:28.815
- What the heck is that?
- Who puts broccoli on pizza?

11:28.855 --> 11:30.095
That's it. I'm done.

11:30.135 --> 11:32.255
Congratulations, San Francisco,

11:32.295 --> 11:33.455
you've ruined pizza!

11:33.495 --> 11:34.975
First the Hawaiians

11:35.015 --> 11:36.317
and now you!

11:37.095 --> 11:39.763
What kind of a pizza place
only serves one kind of pizza?

11:39.975 --> 11:42.199
Must be
a San Francisco thing, huh?

11:42.615 --> 11:44.295
Still, it's not as bad as that soup.

11:44.335 --> 11:46.415
- At that diner in Nebraska.
- Oh, yeah.

11:46.455 --> 11:48.815
The spoon stood up in the soup by itself!

11:48.855 --> 11:50.135
That was disgusting.

11:50.175 --> 11:51.735
Oh, good. Family is running.

11:51.775 --> 11:53.095
Dad's got a steel stomach.

11:53.135 --> 11:54.855
The drive out was pretty fun, huh?

11:54.895 --> 11:56.255
What was your favorite part?

11:56.295 --> 11:57.735
Spitting out the car window!

11:57.775 --> 11:59.255
Definitely not when Dad was singing.

11:59.295 --> 12:00.455
Wearing a seat belt!

12:00.495 --> 12:02.436
Oh! What about the time
with the dinosaur?

12:02.775 --> 12:04.436
- Oh, that's the one.
- Definitely!

12:04.496 --> 12:05.736
Say cheese!

12:05.776 --> 12:07.296
- Dad! Dad!
- Honey!

12:07.336 --> 12:08.957
- Now hold still.
- The car!

12:09.136 --> 12:11.246
Stop! No, no, no!

12:12.976 --> 12:14.096
Nice one, Joy.

12:14.136 --> 12:15.656
I liked that time at the dinosaur.

12:15.696 --> 12:17.601
That was pretty funny.

12:24.576 --> 12:26.402
Wait. What? What happened?

12:27.856 --> 12:29.637
She did something
to the memory.

12:30.536 --> 12:32.816
- What did you do?
- I just touched it.

12:32.856 --> 12:34.776
- That shouldn't make it change.
- Change it back, Joy!

12:34.816 --> 12:36.136
- I'm trying.
- You can't change it back?

12:36.176 --> 12:38.136
- No! I guess I can't!
- Good going, Sadness.

12:38.176 --> 12:39.856
Now when Riley thinks
of that moment with Dad,

12:39.896 --> 12:41.336
she's gonna feel sad.

12:41.376 --> 12:42.856
- Bravo.
- I'm sorry, Joy.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.216
I don't really know...

12:44.256 --> 12:46.002
I thought maybe if you...

12:47.536 --> 12:49.681
Joy, we've got a stairway coming up.

12:51.777 --> 12:53.097
Just don't touch any other memories

12:53.137 --> 12:54.657
until we figure out what's going on.

12:54.697 --> 12:55.977
- Okay.
- All right.

12:56.017 --> 12:58.137
Get ready. This is a monster railing

12:58.177 --> 13:00.401
and we are riding it all the way down!

13:07.537 --> 13:09.518
Wait, what? What happened?

13:10.217 --> 13:11.537
A Core Memory!

13:11.577 --> 13:12.879
Oh, no!

13:15.737 --> 13:16.897
Sadness, what are you doing?

13:16.937 --> 13:18.017
It looked like
one was crooked

13:18.057 --> 13:20.017
so I opened it and then it fell out.

13:20.057 --> 13:21.359
I...

13:25.177 --> 13:26.559
Whoo-hoo!

13:26.897 --> 13:29.777
It's just that...
I wanted to maybe hold one.

13:29.817 --> 13:31.530
- Joy!
- Whoa, whoa!

13:33.418 --> 13:35.658
Sadness, you nearly
touched a Core Memory.

13:35.698 --> 13:38.058
And when you touch them,
we can't change them back.

13:38.098 --> 13:39.298
I know. I'm sorry.

13:39.338 --> 13:41.178
Something's wrong with me.

13:41.218 --> 13:43.178
It's like I'm having a breakdown.

13:43.218 --> 13:45.338
You're not having
a breakdown. It's stress.

13:45.378 --> 13:48.138
I keep making mistakes like that.
I'm awful.

13:48.178 --> 13:50.378
- No, you're not.
- And annoying.

13:50.418 --> 13:52.378
You know what?

13:52.418 --> 13:54.378
You can't focus on what's going wrong.

13:54.418 --> 13:56.138
There's always a way to
turn things around,

13:56.178 --> 13:57.778
to find the fun.

13:57.818 --> 13:59.803
Yeah. Find the fun.

14:00.018 --> 14:01.378
I don't know how to do that.

14:01.418 --> 14:02.778
Okay. Well,

14:02.818 --> 14:04.609
try to think of something funny.

14:04.658 --> 14:05.738
Um... Oh!

14:05.778 --> 14:08.538
Remember the funny movie
where the dog dies?

14:08.578 --> 14:10.658
Oh. Yeah, that's not...

14:10.698 --> 14:12.418
What about that time with Meg

14:12.458 --> 14:14.338
when Riley laughed so hard

14:14.378 --> 14:16.728
milk came out of her nose?

14:18.819 --> 14:21.339
Yeah. That hurt. It felt like fire.

14:21.379 --> 14:23.019
Ooh, it was awful.

14:23.059 --> 14:24.779
Okay, okay, don't think of that.
Let's try something else.

14:24.819 --> 14:26.579
Uh, what are your favorite things to do?

14:26.619 --> 14:27.899
My favorite?

14:27.939 --> 14:30.379
Um... Well, I like it when we're outside.

14:30.419 --> 14:33.379
That's good. Like there's
the beach and sunshine.

14:33.419 --> 14:34.819
Oh! Like that time

14:34.859 --> 14:36.619
we buried Dad
in the sand up to his neck.

14:36.659 --> 14:39.167
I was thinking more like rain.

14:40.499 --> 14:43.539
Rain? Rain is my favorite, too!

14:43.579 --> 14:45.459
We can stomp around in puddles.

14:45.499 --> 14:48.739
You know, there's cool umbrellas,
lightning storms.

14:48.779 --> 14:50.819
More like when
the rain runs down our back

14:50.859 --> 14:52.650
and makes our shoes soggy.

14:52.899 --> 14:55.779
And we get all cold, shivery, and

14:55.819 --> 14:58.660
everything just starts
feeling droopy.

14:58.700 --> 15:01.129
Oh, hey, hey. Hey, easy.

15:01.220 --> 15:02.761
Why are you crying?

15:03.340 --> 15:06.326
It's just like really the opposite
of what we're going for here.

15:06.700 --> 15:08.780
Crying helps me slow down and obsess

15:08.820 --> 15:11.203
over the weight of life's problems.

15:12.380 --> 15:13.660
You know what? Let's, uh,

15:13.700 --> 15:15.020
think about something else.

15:15.060 --> 15:17.860
How about we read
some mind manuals, huh?

15:17.900 --> 15:20.140
- Sounds fun.
- I've read most of them.

15:20.180 --> 15:22.140
Well, have you read this one?
This seems interesting.

15:22.180 --> 15:25.340
"Long Term Memory Retrieval,
Volume 47"?

15:25.380 --> 15:27.888
- No.
- Ooh, a real page-turner!

15:27.940 --> 15:29.820
"Long Term Memory data selection

15:29.860 --> 15:31.580
"via channel subgrouping"?

15:31.620 --> 15:34.180
See? Fun already! Oh, you lucky dog.

15:34.220 --> 15:35.580
You're reading these cool things.

15:35.620 --> 15:38.162
I got to go work. Life is so unfair.

15:47.101 --> 15:48.941
What can we do?
We've only got capital

15:48.981 --> 15:50.772
to last a month, maybe two.

15:51.301 --> 15:52.541
If we can't find investors by then,

15:52.581 --> 15:54.402
we're going to have to lay people off.

15:54.501 --> 15:56.261
Mom! Dad!

15:56.301 --> 15:57.741
Come kiss me good night!

15:57.781 --> 15:59.141
- I know. I know.
- Be right there!

15:59.181 --> 16:01.211
We've got to land this, okay?

16:03.581 --> 16:06.044
Did you hear Dad?
He sounded really upset.

16:09.221 --> 16:11.021
What was that?
Was it a bear? It's a bear!

16:11.061 --> 16:12.621
There are no bears in San Francisco.

16:12.661 --> 16:14.781
I saw a really hairy guy.
He looked like a bear.

16:14.821 --> 16:17.141
Oh, I'm so jumpy. My nerves are shot.

16:17.181 --> 16:18.541
Ew! I don't want to
hear about your nerves.

16:18.581 --> 16:21.421
I'll tell you what it is.
This move has been a bust.

16:21.461 --> 16:23.021
That's what I've been
telling you guys!

16:23.061 --> 16:25.502
There are at least 37 things for
Riley to be scared of right now.

16:25.542 --> 16:27.222
The smell alone is
enough to make her gag.

16:27.262 --> 16:29.222
I can't believe
Mom and Dad moved us here!

16:29.262 --> 16:31.662
Look, I get it. You guys have concerns.

16:31.702 --> 16:33.062
But we've been through worse!

16:33.102 --> 16:34.902
Tell you what,
let's make a list of all the things

16:34.942 --> 16:36.893
Riley should be happy about.

16:37.062 --> 16:39.702
Fine. Let's see, this house stinks,
our room stinks.

16:39.742 --> 16:41.702
- Pizza is weird here.
- Our friends are back home.

16:41.742 --> 16:43.542
And all of our stuff is in the missing van!

16:43.582 --> 16:45.302
Oh, come on. It could be worse.

16:45.342 --> 16:48.533
Yeah, Joy. We could be
lying on the dirty floor. In a bag.

16:48.982 --> 16:50.942
Okay, I admit it, we had a rough start.

16:50.982 --> 16:52.542
But think of all the good things that...

16:52.582 --> 16:54.942
No, Joy. There's
absolutely no reason for Riley

16:54.982 --> 16:56.382
to be happy right now.

16:56.422 --> 16:57.502
Let us handle this.

16:57.542 --> 16:58.742
I say we skip school tomorrow

16:58.782 --> 16:59.982
and lock ourselves in the bedroom.

17:00.022 --> 17:01.782
We have no clean clothes.
I mean, no one should see us.

17:01.822 --> 17:03.502
Yeah, we could cry
until we can't breathe.

17:03.542 --> 17:06.301
We should lock the door
and scream that curse word we know.

17:06.342 --> 17:08.292
- It's a good one!
- Now hold on!

17:08.343 --> 17:10.183
Look, we all have our off days.

17:10.223 --> 17:12.343
- You know...
- Hi, honey.

17:12.383 --> 17:15.143
The Mom bad news train is pulling in.

17:15.183 --> 17:16.463
Toot-toot!

17:16.502 --> 17:18.423
Still no moving van.

17:18.463 --> 17:21.063
Now they're saying it won't be here
till Tuesday, can you believe it?

17:21.103 --> 17:22.223
Toot-toot-toot!

17:22.262 --> 17:24.292
- Where's Dad?
- On the phone.

17:24.583 --> 17:26.463
This new venture
is keeping him pretty busy.

17:26.502 --> 17:28.063
I rest my case!

17:28.103 --> 17:29.823
Oh, your dad's a little stressed,

17:29.863 --> 17:31.903
you know, about getting
his new company up and running.

17:31.943 --> 17:34.690
Now for a few
well-placed withering scowls.

17:36.023 --> 17:39.612
I guess all I really
want to say is, thank you.

17:39.743 --> 17:40.943
- Huh?
- You know,

17:40.983 --> 17:44.143
through all this confusion
you've stayed...

17:44.183 --> 17:46.486
Well,
you've stayed our happy girl.

17:47.543 --> 17:49.404
Your dad's
under a lot of pressure,

17:49.583 --> 17:51.984
but if you and I can keep smiling,

17:52.024 --> 17:53.656
it would be a big help.

17:54.064 --> 17:56.333
We can do that for him. Right?

17:57.304 --> 17:58.606
Whoa.

17:59.264 --> 18:00.726
Well.

18:01.984 --> 18:03.491
Yeah, sure.

18:03.984 --> 18:05.730
What did we do to deserve you?

18:09.824 --> 18:11.525
- Sweet dreams.
- Good night.

18:12.944 --> 18:14.824
Well, you can't argue with Mom.
Happy it is.

18:14.864 --> 18:16.264
Team Happy! Sounds great!

18:16.304 --> 18:17.686
Totally behind you, Joy.

18:19.064 --> 18:20.824
Looks like we're going into REM.

18:20.864 --> 18:22.344
I got Dream Duty, so I'll take care

18:22.384 --> 18:23.824
of sending these to Long Term.

18:23.864 --> 18:25.544
Great day today, guys!

18:25.584 --> 18:27.965
Oh, sleep well, Team Happy!

18:29.264 --> 18:31.693
All right,
what's on tonight, Dream Production?

18:37.345 --> 18:39.375
Well, this is it. The new place.

18:42.665 --> 18:45.333
Come live with me, Riley.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.625
Somebody order a broccoli pizza?

18:47.665 --> 18:49.331
- Eat me!
- I'm organic!

18:50.545 --> 18:54.065
No! Who is in charge
of programming down there?

18:54.105 --> 18:56.374
I know I'm not supposed to do this, but...

19:01.385 --> 19:03.575
We are not going to
end the day like this.

19:47.306 --> 19:48.813
Don't you worry.

19:48.906 --> 19:52.768
I'm gonna make sure
that tomorrow is another great day.

19:53.146 --> 19:54.778
I promise.

20:07.507 --> 20:08.947
Hello! Did I wake you?

20:08.987 --> 20:11.267
- Do you have to play that?
- Well, I have to practice.

20:11.307 --> 20:14.293
And I don't think of it as playing
so much as hugging.

20:15.667 --> 20:16.627
Okay, first day of school!

20:16.667 --> 20:17.747
Very, very exciting.

20:17.787 --> 20:19.947
I was up late last night
figuring out a new plan.

20:19.987 --> 20:21.387
Here it is! Fear.

20:21.427 --> 20:22.947
I need a list of all the possible

20:22.987 --> 20:25.147
negative outcomes
on the first day at a new school.

20:25.187 --> 20:27.307
Way ahead of you there. Does anyone
know how to spell "meteor"?

20:27.347 --> 20:29.507
Disgust. Make sure
Riley stands out today.

20:29.547 --> 20:30.787
But also blends in.

20:30.827 --> 20:32.707
When I'm through,
Riley will look so good,

20:32.747 --> 20:34.947
the other kids will
look at their own outfits and barf.

20:34.987 --> 20:36.027
"Joy." "Yes, Joy?"

20:36.067 --> 20:37.507
"You'll be in charge of the console,

20:37.547 --> 20:38.987
"keeping Riley happy all day long.

20:39.027 --> 20:40.747
"And may I add I love
your dress? It's adorable."

20:40.787 --> 20:42.267
"Oh, this old thing? Thank you so much.

20:42.307 --> 20:43.467
"I love the way it twirls."

20:43.507 --> 20:46.415
Train of Thought! Right on schedule.

20:48.708 --> 20:50.348
Anger. Unload the daydreams.

20:50.388 --> 20:52.708
I ordered extra
in case things get slow in class.

20:52.748 --> 20:54.788
It might come in handy.
If this new school is full of

20:54.828 --> 20:57.708
boring, useless classes.
Which it probably will be.

20:57.748 --> 21:01.548
Oh. Sadness. I have
a super important job just for you.

21:01.588 --> 21:03.653
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm. Follow me.

21:05.628 --> 21:08.308
- What are you doing?
- And there. Perfect!

21:08.348 --> 21:10.428
This is the circle of Sadness.

21:10.468 --> 21:12.228
Your job is to make sure that

21:12.268 --> 21:15.015
all the Sadness stays inside of it.

21:15.108 --> 21:17.708
So you want me to just stand here?

21:17.748 --> 21:20.668
Hey, it's not my place to
tell you how to do your job.

21:20.708 --> 21:24.148
Just make sure that all the Sadness

21:24.188 --> 21:25.508
stays in the circle!

21:25.548 --> 21:28.709
See? You're a pro at this! Isn't this fun?

21:28.749 --> 21:29.869
- No.
- Atta girl.

21:29.909 --> 21:31.189
All right, everyone, fresh start.

21:31.229 --> 21:33.429
We are gonna have a good day,
which will turn into a good week,

21:33.469 --> 21:34.629
which will turn into a good year,

21:34.669 --> 21:35.989
which turns into a good life!

21:36.029 --> 21:39.189
So, the big day!
New school, new friends, huh?

21:39.229 --> 21:41.509
I know! I'm kind of nervous,
but I'm mostly excited.

21:41.549 --> 21:43.189
How do I look? Do you like my shirt?

21:43.229 --> 21:44.861
Very cute!

21:44.909 --> 21:46.549
Are you gonna be okay?
You want us to walk with you?

21:46.589 --> 21:49.189
Mom and Dad? With us in public?
No thank you.

21:49.229 --> 21:50.269
Uh... I'm on it!

21:50.309 --> 21:52.629
Nope! I'm fine. Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.

21:52.669 --> 21:54.330
Have a good day at school, monkey.

21:59.469 --> 22:01.260
Have a great day, sweetheart!

22:01.749 --> 22:03.189
That's crazy. It really is.

22:03.229 --> 22:04.570
That was so funny.

22:05.269 --> 22:07.570
Do you know
what basketball game is coming up?

22:08.109 --> 22:09.189
Are you sure we want to do this?

22:09.229 --> 22:12.501
- In we go!
- Okay! Going in! Yes!

22:16.750 --> 22:17.830
Did you see her? Hello!

22:17.870 --> 22:19.790
Okay, we've got
a group of cool girls at two o'clock.

22:19.830 --> 22:21.230
- How do you know?
- Double ears pierced,

22:21.270 --> 22:22.390
infinity scarf.

22:22.430 --> 22:23.750
Whoa. Is she
wearing eye shadow?

22:23.790 --> 22:25.830
- Yeah, we want to be friends with them.
- Let's go talk to them!

22:25.870 --> 22:27.670
Are you kidding?
We're not talking to them.

22:27.710 --> 22:29.030
We want them to like us.

22:29.070 --> 22:30.470
Oh. Yeah. Wait, what?

22:30.510 --> 22:32.390
Almost finished
with the potential disasters.

22:32.430 --> 22:34.670
Worst scenario is either quicksand,

22:34.710 --> 22:36.190
spontaneous combustion,

22:36.230 --> 22:37.990
or getting called on by the teacher.

22:38.030 --> 22:39.310
So as long as none of those happen...

22:39.350 --> 22:42.030
Okay, everybody.
We have a new student in class today.

22:42.070 --> 22:44.110
Are you kidding me? Out of the gate?

22:44.150 --> 22:45.430
This is not happening!

22:45.470 --> 22:48.190
Riley, would you like
to tell us something about yourself?

22:48.230 --> 22:50.430
No! Pretend we can't speak English.

22:50.470 --> 22:51.977
Don't worry. I got this.

22:52.790 --> 22:54.581
Uh... Okay.

22:54.790 --> 22:56.431
My name is Riley Andersen.

22:56.471 --> 22:59.981
I'm from Minnesota and now I live here.

23:01.991 --> 23:04.311
And how about Minnesota?

23:04.351 --> 23:05.671
Can you tell us something about it?

23:05.711 --> 23:08.253
Well, you certainly
get a lot more snow than we do.

23:10.271 --> 23:12.222
She's hilarious!

23:13.591 --> 23:15.151
Yeah, it gets pretty cold.

23:15.191 --> 23:16.271
The lake freezes over,

23:16.311 --> 23:17.711
and that's when we play hockey.

23:17.751 --> 23:20.111
I'm on a great team.
We're called the Prairie Dogs.

23:20.151 --> 23:23.058
My friend Meg plays forward.
And my dad's the coach.

23:23.511 --> 23:25.974
Pretty much everyone
in my family skates.

23:26.031 --> 23:27.431
It's kind of a family tradition.

23:27.471 --> 23:29.536
We go out on the lake
almost every weekend.

23:32.231 --> 23:35.071
Or we did, till I moved away.

23:35.111 --> 23:36.551
- Hey, what gives?
- Wait, what?

23:36.591 --> 23:40.152
Hey, Sadness! You touched
a memory? We talked about this.

23:40.192 --> 23:41.992
Oh, yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

23:42.032 --> 23:45.152
Get back in your circle.
What's going on?

23:45.192 --> 23:47.192
- Why won't it eject?
- Get it out of there, Joy.

23:47.232 --> 23:49.672
We used
to play tag and stuff.

23:49.712 --> 23:51.472
Cool kids whispering at three o'clock!

23:51.512 --> 23:52.552
- Did you see that look?
- Oh, no.

23:52.592 --> 23:53.894
They're judging us!

23:55.032 --> 23:57.700
Somebody help me!
Grab that... Everybody put...

23:57.832 --> 24:00.181
But everything's different now.

24:00.712 --> 24:02.060
Since we moved.

24:04.432 --> 24:07.832
Oh, no! We're crying! At school!

24:07.872 --> 24:10.460
What? Sadness! What are you doing?

24:11.192 --> 24:13.734
Oh, no! Oh, I'm sorry!

24:13.792 --> 24:14.952
Huh?

24:14.992 --> 24:16.872
It's a Core Memory!

24:16.912 --> 24:18.624
But it's blue.

24:20.072 --> 24:23.856
No! Wait! Stop it! No! Ah! No!

24:30.713 --> 24:31.993
Joy, no.

24:32.033 --> 24:33.513
- That's a Core Memory!
- Hey!

24:33.553 --> 24:35.060
- Joy, wait!
- Stop it! Let go!

24:35.513 --> 24:37.384
Ah! The Core Memories!

24:51.993 --> 24:53.455
No, no, no, no!

24:56.593 --> 24:58.976
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

25:06.474 --> 25:07.914
Thank you, Riley.

25:07.954 --> 25:10.434
I know it can be tough
moving to a new place,

25:10.474 --> 25:12.539
but we're happy to have you here.

25:12.954 --> 25:15.074
All right, everyone,
get out your history books

25:15.114 --> 25:16.985
and turn to chapter seven.

25:19.394 --> 25:21.299
Can I say that curse word now?

25:38.754 --> 25:41.137
Ah!

25:42.194 --> 25:45.658
Oh, no! One, two, three. Okay.

25:46.674 --> 25:50.139
I got them. Where are we?

25:50.995 --> 25:53.537
Long Term Memory? Wait...

25:59.835 --> 26:01.661
Goofball Island?

26:02.635 --> 26:04.635
Riley's Islands of Personality.

26:04.675 --> 26:06.501
They're all down!

26:07.035 --> 26:08.995
Oh! This is bad.

26:09.035 --> 26:11.338
We... We can fix this!

26:11.675 --> 26:13.555
We just have to
get back to Headquarters,

26:13.595 --> 26:15.075
plug the Core Memories in,

26:15.115 --> 26:17.100
and Riley will be back to normal.

26:17.955 --> 26:20.235
Riley has no Core Memories.

26:20.275 --> 26:22.658
No Personality Islands and no...

26:23.595 --> 26:24.835
What? What is it?

26:24.875 --> 26:25.995
You.

26:26.035 --> 26:27.875
You're not in Headquarters.

26:27.915 --> 26:30.867
Without you, Riley can't be happy.

26:31.235 --> 26:33.141
We got to get you back up there.

26:33.556 --> 26:35.143
I'm coming, Riley.

26:49.076 --> 26:51.276
So, as it turns out, the green trash can

26:51.316 --> 26:53.356
is not recycling, it's for greens.

26:53.396 --> 26:55.076
- Like compost. And eggshells.
- Mmm.

26:55.116 --> 26:56.836
And the blue one is recycling.

26:56.876 --> 26:58.796
- And the black one is trash.
- Riley is acting so weird.

26:58.836 --> 26:59.916
Why is she acting so weird?

26:59.956 --> 27:02.316
What do you expect?
All the Islands are down.

27:02.356 --> 27:03.476
Joy would know what to do.

27:03.516 --> 27:04.756
That's it.

27:04.796 --> 27:07.596
Until she gets back,
we just do what Joy would do!

27:07.636 --> 27:10.556
Great idea. Anger, Fear, Disgust,

27:10.596 --> 27:12.228
how are we supposed to be happy?

27:12.436 --> 27:14.556
Hey, Riley. I've got good news!

27:14.596 --> 27:17.477
I found a junior hockey league
right here in San Francisco.

27:17.517 --> 27:19.557
And get this: Try-outs are tomorrow

27:19.597 --> 27:21.557
after school. What luck, right?

27:21.597 --> 27:22.957
- Hockey?
- Uh-oh. What do we do?

27:22.997 --> 27:24.597
Guys, this is...

27:24.637 --> 27:25.837
You pretend to be Joy.

27:25.877 --> 27:28.067
Won't it be great to be
back out on the ice?

27:29.757 --> 27:32.299
Oh, yeah, that sounds fantastic.

27:32.957 --> 27:34.917
What was that?
That wasn't anything like Joy!

27:34.957 --> 27:37.420
- Uh, because I'm not Joy.
- Yeah, no kidding.

27:39.437 --> 27:40.757
Did you guys pick up on that?

27:40.797 --> 27:42.557
- Mmm-hmm. Something's wrong.
- Totally.

27:42.597 --> 27:43.917
Should we ask her?

27:43.957 --> 27:45.717
Let's probe. But keep it subtle,

27:45.757 --> 27:47.077
so she doesn't notice.

27:47.117 --> 27:49.277
So, how was the first day of school?

27:49.317 --> 27:50.397
She's probing us.

27:50.437 --> 27:51.797
I'm done. You pretend to be Joy.

27:51.837 --> 27:54.505
What? Okay. Um, hmm.

27:54.637 --> 27:57.717
It was fine, I guess. I don't know.

27:57.757 --> 28:00.718
Oh. Very smooth. That was just like Joy.

28:00.758 --> 28:02.638
Something is definitely going on.

28:02.678 --> 28:05.380
She's never acted like this before.
What should we do?

28:05.478 --> 28:06.758
We're going to
find out what's happening.

28:06.798 --> 28:08.118
But we'll need support.

28:08.158 --> 28:09.460
Signal the husband.

28:10.158 --> 28:11.506
Ahem!

28:12.838 --> 28:15.118
<i>With a nice
pass over to Reeves,</i>

28:15.158 --> 28:16.620
<i>comes across ...and nice!</i>

28:19.958 --> 28:23.478
Uh-oh. She's looking at us.
Uh, what did she say?

28:23.518 --> 28:26.118
What? Oh! Sorry, sir.
No one was listening.

28:26.158 --> 28:28.278
Is it garbage night?
We left the toilet seat up?

28:28.318 --> 28:30.318
What? What is it, woman? What?

28:30.358 --> 28:32.478
Ugh, he's making that stupid face again.

28:32.518 --> 28:34.478
I could strangle him right now.

28:34.518 --> 28:35.866
Signal him again.

28:38.238 --> 28:41.078
Ah! So, Riley, how was school?

28:41.118 --> 28:43.039
- You got to be kidding me!
- Seriously?

28:43.079 --> 28:46.224
For this we gave up
that Brazilian helicopter pilot?

28:46.439 --> 28:48.185
Move! I'll be Joy.

28:48.399 --> 28:50.359
School was great, all right?

28:50.399 --> 28:52.479
Riley. Is everything okay?

28:52.519 --> 28:53.759
Ugh!

28:53.799 --> 28:55.599
Sir, she just rolled her eyes at us.

28:55.639 --> 28:57.079
What is her deal?

28:57.119 --> 28:58.839
All right, make a show of force.

28:58.879 --> 29:00.399
I don't want to have to
put "the foot" down.

29:00.439 --> 29:02.519
No, not the foot!

29:02.559 --> 29:04.799
Riley, I do not like this new attitude.

29:04.839 --> 29:06.479
Oh, I'll show you attitude, old man.

29:06.519 --> 29:08.185
No. No, no, no! Stay happy!

29:08.639 --> 29:10.839
What is your problem?
Just leave me alone!

29:10.879 --> 29:12.909
Sir, reporting high levels of sass!

29:13.079 --> 29:14.639
Take it to DEFCON Two.

29:14.679 --> 29:17.028
You heard that, gentlemen.
DEFCON Two.

29:17.999 --> 29:19.519
Listen, young lady, I don't know where

29:19.559 --> 29:21.639
this disrespectful attitude came from...

29:21.679 --> 29:23.239
You want a piece of this, pops?

29:23.279 --> 29:24.559
Come and get it!

29:24.599 --> 29:26.240
Yeah, well... Well...

29:26.280 --> 29:28.709
Here it comes. Prepare the foot!

29:30.000 --> 29:31.712
Keys to safety position.

29:33.360 --> 29:35.141
Ready to launch on your command, sir!

29:37.600 --> 29:39.426
Just shut up!

29:40.280 --> 29:41.707
Fire!

29:41.920 --> 29:45.520
That's it! Go to your room! Now!

29:45.560 --> 29:46.862
Uh!

29:49.000 --> 29:51.907
The foot is down! The foot is down!

29:53.120 --> 29:54.760
Good job, gentlemen.

29:54.800 --> 29:56.626
That could have been a disaster.

29:57.160 --> 29:58.906
Well, that was a disaster.

30:02.080 --> 30:05.191
Come fly with me, <i>gatinha.</i>

30:17.281 --> 30:20.028
We're going to walk out there? On that?

30:20.121 --> 30:21.841
It's the quickest way back.

30:21.881 --> 30:23.921
But it's right over the Memory Dump.

30:23.961 --> 30:26.401
If we fall, we'll be forgotten forever.

30:26.441 --> 30:30.241
We have to do this for Riley.
Just follow my footsteps.

30:30.281 --> 30:31.761
- Oh, okay.
- It's not that high.

30:31.801 --> 30:34.025
It's totally fine...

30:42.161 --> 30:43.543
No!

30:49.961 --> 30:51.343
Hey.

30:51.961 --> 30:55.267
So, uh, things got a little
out of hand downstairs.

30:56.002 --> 30:57.634
Do you want to talk about it?

30:58.882 --> 31:01.390
Come on, where's my happy girl?

31:02.842 --> 31:04.952
Monkey.

31:05.002 --> 31:07.226
Oh, he's trying to start up Goofball.

31:08.002 --> 31:09.304
Come on!

31:19.682 --> 31:20.984
Ah!

31:21.722 --> 31:23.468
Go back! Run, run, run!

31:51.363 --> 31:52.745
What...

32:08.083 --> 32:11.035
I get it. You need some alone time.

32:13.683 --> 32:15.190
We'll talk later.

32:18.723 --> 32:20.204
We have a major problem.

32:20.244 --> 32:22.468
Oh, Joy, where are you?

32:23.564 --> 32:25.913
We lost Goofball Island.

32:26.324 --> 32:27.884
That means she can lose Friendship

32:27.924 --> 32:30.387
and Hockey and Honesty and Family.

32:31.204 --> 32:33.269
You can fix this, right, Joy?

32:33.724 --> 32:36.484
I, uh... I don't know.

32:36.524 --> 32:38.364
- Oh...
- But we have to try.

32:38.404 --> 32:39.786
Okay, come on.

32:40.884 --> 32:42.844
- Riley's gone to sleep.
- Oh...

32:42.884 --> 32:45.484
Which is a good thing.

32:45.524 --> 32:46.804
When you think about it because

32:46.844 --> 32:48.964
nothing else bad
can happen while she's asleep.

32:49.004 --> 32:51.204
We'll be back to Headquarters
before she wakes up.

32:51.244 --> 32:53.912
We'll just go across Friendship Island.

32:56.084 --> 32:57.444
Oh, we'll never make it.

32:57.484 --> 32:58.724
- Oh, no!
- No, no, no!

32:58.764 --> 33:00.324
Don't obsess over
the weight of life's problems.

33:00.364 --> 33:02.364
Remember the funny movie
where the dog dies?

33:02.404 --> 33:04.965
Oh, Sadness,
we don't have time for this.

33:05.005 --> 33:08.469
We'll just have to go around.
Take the scenic route.

33:08.605 --> 33:11.245
Wait, Joy,
you could get lost in there!

33:11.285 --> 33:12.805
Think positive!

33:12.845 --> 33:16.468
Okay. I'm positive
you will get lost in there.

33:16.805 --> 33:18.790
That's Long Term Memory.

33:19.005 --> 33:21.245
An endless warren
of corridors and shelves.

33:21.285 --> 33:23.156
I read about it in the manuals.

33:23.845 --> 33:25.565
The manuals?

33:25.605 --> 33:26.725
The manuals!

33:26.765 --> 33:28.605
- You read the manuals!
- Yeah.

33:28.645 --> 33:30.914
So you know
the way back to Headquarters!

33:31.045 --> 33:32.205
I guess.

33:32.245 --> 33:34.355
Ooh!

33:35.045 --> 33:36.365
You are my map!

33:36.405 --> 33:38.685
Let's go! Lead on, my map!

33:38.725 --> 33:39.845
Show me where we're going!

33:39.885 --> 33:43.685
Okay. Only I'm too sad to walk.

33:43.725 --> 33:46.646
Just give me a few... hours.

33:46.686 --> 33:48.034
Ooh!

33:48.486 --> 33:49.646
Which way? Left?

33:49.686 --> 33:51.068
Right.

33:51.166 --> 33:52.486
No. I mean, go left.

33:52.526 --> 33:54.446
I said left was right. Like "correct."

33:54.486 --> 33:55.806
Okay.

33:55.846 --> 33:58.036
This actually
feels kind of nice.

33:58.086 --> 33:59.726
Okay, here we go!

33:59.766 --> 34:01.926
We'll be back to Headquarters
before morning.

34:01.966 --> 34:05.714
We can do it! This will be easy!
This is working!

34:08.766 --> 34:11.485
This is not working.
Are we getting close?

34:11.525 --> 34:13.317
Yeah, just another right.

34:13.806 --> 34:18.326
And... a left and then another... left and...

34:18.366 --> 34:21.005
Uh, are you sure
you know where we're going?

34:21.045 --> 34:24.078
Because we seem to be
walking away from Headquarters.

34:24.886 --> 34:26.966
Riley's awake.

34:27.005 --> 34:28.467
Ooh! Oh!

34:30.647 --> 34:32.167
Don't touch. Remember?

34:32.206 --> 34:34.806
If you touch them, they stay sad.

34:34.847 --> 34:38.246
Oh, sorry, I won't. Starting now.

34:38.286 --> 34:40.687
Oh, I can't take much more of this.

34:40.726 --> 34:42.167
Forget them!

34:42.206 --> 34:43.286
Mind workers!

34:43.327 --> 34:44.754
But, Joy, we're almost...

34:46.047 --> 34:47.167
Phone numbers.

34:47.206 --> 34:48.806
We don't need all these.
They're in her phone.

34:48.847 --> 34:51.588
- Excuse me, hi.
- Just forget all of that. Please. Forget it!

34:52.487 --> 34:54.047
- I need to find Friendship Island.
- Look at this.

34:54.087 --> 34:55.847
Four years of piano lessons.

34:55.887 --> 34:56.967
Yeah,
it looks pretty faded.

34:57.007 --> 34:58.487
You know what'? Save <i>Chopsticks</i>

34:58.527 --> 35:00.428
and <i>Heart and Soul,</i> get rid of the rest.

35:00.567 --> 35:02.047
- Are you...
- US Presidents. What do you think?

35:02.087 --> 35:04.207
Yeah, just keep
Washington, Lincoln and the fat one.

35:04.247 --> 35:05.487
- Forget 'em!
- Hey!

35:05.527 --> 35:06.687
You can't throw those away!

35:06.727 --> 35:08.007
Those are perfectly good memories.

35:08.047 --> 35:10.367
The names of
every "Cutie Pie Princess" doll?

35:10.407 --> 35:12.207
Yes! That is critical information!

35:12.247 --> 35:13.568
Glitterstorm, Honeypants...

35:13.608 --> 35:14.956
Forget 'em!

35:19.848 --> 35:20.968
Hey! Bring those back!

35:21.008 --> 35:23.208
They're in the dump. Nothing
comes back from the dump.

35:23.248 --> 35:24.768
Yeah. Look, lady, this is our job, okay?

35:24.808 --> 35:27.088
When Riley doesn't care
about a memory, it fades.

35:27.128 --> 35:28.768
- Fades?
- Happens to the best of them.

35:28.808 --> 35:32.591
Yeah, except for this bad boy.
This one will never fade.

35:32.768 --> 35:34.848
<i>♪ TripleDent gum
♪ Will make you smile ♪</i>

35:34.888 --> 35:36.328
The song
from the gum commercial?

35:36.368 --> 35:37.448
You know, sometimes we send that one

35:37.488 --> 35:38.568
up to Headquarters for no reason.

35:38.608 --> 35:41.128
It just plays in Riley's head
over and over again.

35:41.168 --> 35:42.808
Like a million times!

35:42.848 --> 35:44.208
Let's watch it again!

35:44.248 --> 35:45.368
<i>♪ TripleDent gum ♪</i>

35:45.408 --> 35:47.368
Yeah, I know. We all know the song.

35:47.408 --> 35:48.808
Okay. Yeah, real catchy. Okay.

35:48.848 --> 35:49.888
Hey, what do you think?
Should we do it?

35:49.928 --> 35:51.088
Yeah!

35:51.128 --> 35:52.919
Okay, here we go!

35:55.968 --> 35:57.009
<i>♪ TripleDent gum ♪</i>

35:57.049 --> 35:58.715
What the... This again?

35:59.929 --> 36:02.437
Wait! Do you know how to
get to Friendship Island?

36:02.569 --> 36:03.729
<i>♪ TripleDent gum ♪</i>

36:03.769 --> 36:05.769

36:05.809 --> 36:07.009
<i>Is the bridge cool?</i>

36:07.049 --> 36:08.449
Yeah, it's good.

36:08.489 --> 36:09.649
What happened with the playoffs?

36:09.689 --> 36:10.769
<i>We won the first game.</i>

36:10.809 --> 36:13.049
<i>Coach says we might actually
go to the finals this year.</i>

36:13.089 --> 36:14.769
<i>Oh, and we've got
this new girl on the team.</i>

36:14.809 --> 36:16.009
<i>She's so cool.</i>

36:16.049 --> 36:17.689
Uh, she did not just say that.

36:17.729 --> 36:20.049
A new girl? Meg has
a new friend already?

36:20.089 --> 36:22.289
Hey, hey! Stay happy!

36:22.329 --> 36:24.489
We do not want to lose
any more islands here, guys!

36:24.529 --> 36:25.609
<i>We can pass

36:25.649 --> 36:28.289
<i>without even looking.

36:28.329 --> 36:29.609
You like to read minds, Meg?

36:29.649 --> 36:31.409
I got something
for you to read, right here!

36:31.449 --> 36:33.350
Let's just be calm for one second! Ahhh!

36:33.809 --> 36:35.409
<i>- I heard they have parrots...</i>
- I've got to go.

36:35.449 --> 36:37.081
<i>- What?</i>
- I got to go!

36:38.049 --> 36:40.351
Okay, could you just please
tell me which way is...

36:41.290 --> 36:42.672
Oh, no!

36:45.690 --> 36:47.675
Friendship Island! What?

36:58.690 --> 37:00.675
Oh, not Friendship.

37:06.450 --> 37:11.075
Oh, Riley loved that one.
And now it's gone.

37:11.330 --> 37:14.516
Goodbye, friendship.
Hello, loneliness.

37:18.770 --> 37:21.312
We'll just have to go the long way.

37:21.530 --> 37:26.360
Yeah. The long, long, long, long way.

37:27.211 --> 37:28.673
I'm ready.

37:28.771 --> 37:32.042
There's got to be
a better way.

37:34.091 --> 37:35.771
Ooh! Look at you!

37:35.811 --> 37:37.011
Huh?

37:37.051 --> 37:39.691
I will take you, but not you.

37:39.731 --> 37:42.034
Oh, who am I kidding?
I can't leave you.

37:42.331 --> 37:43.971
Hello!

37:44.011 --> 37:45.473
Wait! Hey! Wait!

37:47.571 --> 37:49.033
Oh, wait! Stop!

37:57.691 --> 37:59.118
- Excuse me.
- Ah!

37:59.651 --> 38:02.531
Uh, I was looking for, um... Diversion!

38:02.571 --> 38:04.715
- What?
- Ha-ha! So long, sucker!

38:05.931 --> 38:07.172
Ow, I hurt all over.

38:07.212 --> 38:08.892
Wait. I know you.

38:08.932 --> 38:12.452
No, you don't. I get that a lot.
I look like a lot of people.

38:12.492 --> 38:14.212
No, no, no. I do.

38:14.252 --> 38:16.892
Bing Bong! Riley's imaginary friend!

38:16.932 --> 38:19.492
- You really do know me?
- Well, of course!

38:19.532 --> 38:22.052
Riley loved playing with you!
You two are best friends!

38:22.092 --> 38:23.572
Oh! Oh, you would know.

38:23.612 --> 38:24.892
We're trying to get
back to Headquarters.

38:24.932 --> 38:27.052
Headquarters? You guys
are from Headquarters?

38:27.092 --> 38:29.892
Well, yeah. I'm Joy. This is Sadness.

38:29.932 --> 38:31.892
- You're Joy? The Joy?
- Mmm-hmm.

38:31.932 --> 38:33.532
What the heck are you doing out here?

38:33.572 --> 38:35.732
That's a good question.
You want to answer that, Sadness?

38:35.772 --> 38:38.852
Wow. Without you,
Riley won't ever be happy.

38:38.892 --> 38:41.252
We can't have that.
We got to get you back.

38:41.292 --> 38:42.652
I'll tell you what. Follow me!

38:42.692 --> 38:44.332
Oh, thank you!

38:44.372 --> 38:46.092
It is so great to see you again.

38:46.132 --> 38:48.412
I gotta tell you, I am such
a huge fan of your work.

38:48.452 --> 38:50.853
Do you remember when you
and Riley were in a band?

38:50.893 --> 38:53.493
I went to all of your concerts.

38:53.533 --> 38:54.853
Yeah, I blow a mean nose.

38:54.893 --> 38:56.573
Watching you play tag
was such a treat.

38:56.613 --> 38:58.053
Two-time world champ.

38:58.093 --> 38:59.653
Oh! And remember your rockets?

38:59.693 --> 39:02.013
Of course!
It runs on song power!

39:02.053 --> 39:03.573
That's right! Your theme song!

39:03.613 --> 39:04.933

39:12.013 --> 39:14.613
You know, it's unclear.
I'm mostly cotton candy.

39:14.653 --> 39:19.573
But shape-wise I'm part cat,
part elephant, part dolphin.

39:19.613 --> 39:21.040
Dolphin?

39:23.613 --> 39:25.133
You got to remember,
when Riley was three,

39:25.173 --> 39:26.613
animals were all the rage.

39:26.653 --> 39:28.573
The cow goes moo.
The horse goes neigh.

39:28.613 --> 39:30.053
That's all people talked about back then.

39:30.093 --> 39:31.613
Yeah. Yeah. I guess that's true.

39:31.653 --> 39:32.733
What are you doing out here?

39:32.773 --> 39:36.254
Well, there's not much call
for imaginary friends lately.

39:36.294 --> 39:38.962
So, uh, I, you know, um...

39:40.534 --> 39:42.934
Hey, hey. Don't be sad.

39:42.974 --> 39:45.094
Tell you what. When I get
back up to Headquarters,

39:45.134 --> 39:47.134
I'll make sure Riley remembers you.

39:47.174 --> 39:48.534
- You will?
- Of course!

39:48.574 --> 39:50.694
She'd love that.

39:50.734 --> 39:52.974
This is the greatest day of my life!

39:53.014 --> 39:54.814
Ha, cha, cha, cha, cha. Ow!

39:54.854 --> 39:56.974
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

39:57.014 --> 39:58.521
Oh, are you okay?

39:58.654 --> 39:59.934
Hey, what's going on?

39:59.974 --> 40:01.574
I cry candy.

40:01.614 --> 40:03.174
Try the caramel. It's delicious.

40:03.214 --> 40:04.846
Ooh. Whoa!

40:05.094 --> 40:06.734
Ooh, here, use this.

40:06.774 --> 40:08.675
- Thanks!
- Whoa, hold on, wait a second.

40:12.094 --> 40:14.159
It always gets stuck at the bottom.

40:16.534 --> 40:19.680
Here. What? It's imaginary.

40:19.775 --> 40:21.655
Thanks. This will make it a lot easier

40:21.695 --> 40:22.815
to walk back to Headquarters.

40:22.855 --> 40:24.615
Walk? We're not walking.

40:24.655 --> 40:27.004
We're taking the Train of Thought!

40:28.415 --> 40:30.215
The train, of course!

40:30.255 --> 40:32.895
That is so much faster!
But how do we catch it?

40:32.935 --> 40:34.695
Well, it kind of goes all over the place,

40:34.735 --> 40:36.716
but there is a station
in Imagination Land.

40:37.335 --> 40:39.957
I know a shortcut. Come on, this way!

40:40.015 --> 40:42.478
Oh, I am so glad we ran into you!

40:42.735 --> 40:45.495
The station is right
through here. After you.

40:45.535 --> 40:46.815
- Joy.
- What?

40:46.855 --> 40:48.535
I read about this place

40:48.575 --> 40:50.295
in the manual. We shouldn't go in there.

40:50.335 --> 40:52.335
Bing Bong says
it's the quickest way to Headquarters.

40:52.375 --> 40:54.495
No, but, Joy, this is abstract thought.

40:54.535 --> 40:55.695
What are you talking about?

40:55.735 --> 40:58.615
I go in here all the time.
It's a shortcut, you see?

40:58.655 --> 41:02.564
D-A-N-G-E-R. Shortcut.
I'll prove it to you.

41:03.416 --> 41:06.456
Look at me. I'm closer to the station

41:06.496 --> 41:08.561
because I'm taking the shortcut.

41:08.736 --> 41:10.696
Let's go around. This way.

41:10.736 --> 41:12.607
Almost there!

41:13.376 --> 41:15.776
If you want to walk the
long way, go for it.

41:15.816 --> 41:17.896
But Riley needs to be happy.

41:17.936 --> 41:19.496
I'm not missing that train.

41:19.536 --> 41:20.896
Bing Bong knows what he's doing.

41:20.936 --> 41:22.936
He's part dolphin.
They're very smart.

41:22.976 --> 41:24.927
Well, I guess.

41:27.576 --> 41:29.720
- What did you get?
- I don't know.

41:43.457 --> 41:45.217
Okay, what abstract concept

41:45.257 --> 41:46.577
are we trying to comprehend today?

41:46.617 --> 41:48.537
Um... Loneliness.

41:48.577 --> 41:50.577
Hmm. Looks like
there's something in there.

41:50.617 --> 41:51.817
I'm going to turn it on for a minute

41:51.857 --> 41:53.177
and burn out the gunk.

41:53.217 --> 41:55.817
What did I tell you?
You'll be at Headquarters in no time.

41:55.857 --> 41:57.097
Whoa!

41:57.137 --> 41:58.657
Say,
would you look at that?

41:58.697 --> 42:00.697
Whoa! What's happening?

42:00.737 --> 42:02.097
Oh, no, they turned it on.

42:02.137 --> 42:04.440
Huh. Never seen this before.

42:07.057 --> 42:10.457
My face! My beautiful face! Oh!

42:10.497 --> 42:12.097
- What is going on?
- We're abstracting!

42:12.137 --> 42:14.297
There are four stages. This is the first:

42:14.337 --> 42:16.137
Non-objective Fragmentation!

42:16.177 --> 42:17.297
All right. Do not panic.

42:17.337 --> 42:20.721
What is important is that
we all stay together. Oh!

42:22.297 --> 42:23.977
We're in the second stage.
We're deconstructing!

42:24.017 --> 42:26.400
Run! Ah!

42:26.817 --> 42:28.609
I can't feel my legs!

42:29.058 --> 42:30.218
Oh, there they are.

42:30.258 --> 42:31.640
Come here, me!

42:33.138 --> 42:34.698
We've got to get out of here

42:34.738 --> 42:36.458
before we're nothing
but shape and color!

42:36.498 --> 42:38.858
Ow! We'll get stuck here forever!

42:38.898 --> 42:40.578
Stuck? Why did we come in here?

42:40.618 --> 42:42.938
I told you, it's a shortcut!

42:42.978 --> 42:45.407
The train!

42:48.778 --> 42:52.178
Oh, no. We're
two-dimensional! That's stage three!

42:52.218 --> 42:53.520
We're getting nowhere!

42:53.578 --> 42:56.200
- Depth! I'm lacking depth!
- Come on.

42:59.498 --> 43:01.085
We can't fit.

43:01.298 --> 43:03.178
Oh, no, we're Nonfigurative.

43:03.218 --> 43:04.858
This is the last stage!

43:04.898 --> 43:06.719
We're not going to make it!

43:08.658 --> 43:12.123
Wait! We're
two-dimensional. Fall on your face!

43:22.979 --> 43:25.044
Stop! Stop!

43:26.499 --> 43:29.379
Oh, no! I thought you said
that was a shortcut.

43:29.419 --> 43:32.379
I did, but wow,
we should not have gone in there.

43:32.419 --> 43:34.419
That was dangerous!
They really should put up a sign.

43:34.459 --> 43:35.819
How long until the next train?

43:35.859 --> 43:37.899
Who knows. But don't worry.

43:37.939 --> 43:39.539
There's another station. That way.

43:39.579 --> 43:41.059
The train always stops there.

43:41.099 --> 43:42.699
Right before it goes to Headquarters.

43:42.739 --> 43:44.739
If we hurry, we can catch it.

43:44.779 --> 43:46.899
This isn't another one
of your shortcuts, is it?

43:46.939 --> 43:49.049
Yeah!

43:49.699 --> 43:51.059
Is there really another station?

43:51.099 --> 43:52.686
Uh-huh. Through there.

43:54.940 --> 43:57.460
Welcome to Imagination Land!

43:57.500 --> 43:58.580
Imagination Land?

43:58.620 --> 43:59.740
Sure!

43:59.780 --> 44:02.100
I come here all the time.
I'm practically the mayor.

44:02.140 --> 44:04.980
Hey, you guys hungry?
There's French Fry Forest!

44:05.020 --> 44:07.164
- Mmm! Delicious.
- No way!

44:08.100 --> 44:10.100
Check it out!
Trophy Town!

44:10.140 --> 44:13.411
Medals! Ribbons! Everyone's a winner!

44:14.020 --> 44:15.300
I won first place!

44:15.340 --> 44:18.740
- Me too!
- Oh, participation award.

44:18.780 --> 44:21.580
Wait, is that... Sadness,
look, it's Cloud Town!

44:21.620 --> 44:23.340
That is my favorite!

44:23.380 --> 44:25.620
Oh, it's so soft!

44:25.660 --> 44:27.260
Oh! Let me try.

44:27.300 --> 44:29.260
Hey! What's the big idea?

44:29.300 --> 44:32.047
You better fix that wall,
or else you're in big troub...

44:34.140 --> 44:37.021
Oh, no! Lava! Whoo! Oh!

44:37.061 --> 44:39.251
Imagination Land is the best!

44:39.541 --> 44:43.101
Oh, is it all going to be so interactive?

44:43.141 --> 44:45.341
Hey, look! The House of Cards!

44:45.381 --> 44:47.332
Oh, wait. Hang on just a minute.

44:47.461 --> 44:49.381
- Your rocket!
- Yeah.

44:49.421 --> 44:51.141
I stashed it in there for safekeeping,

44:51.181 --> 44:53.928
and now I'm all set to
take Riley to the moon!

44:54.781 --> 44:56.527
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Great.

44:56.701 --> 44:58.861
Oh, I love Imagination Land.

44:58.901 --> 45:01.489
Isn't it great? And there's
always something new, like...

45:04.261 --> 45:05.581
Who the heck is that?

45:05.621 --> 45:07.021
Imaginary boyfriend.

45:07.061 --> 45:08.701
I would die for Riley.

45:08.741 --> 45:10.901
Oh, I've never seen him before.

45:10.941 --> 45:12.482
I live in Canada.

45:12.661 --> 45:15.061
Anyway, this way.
Through Preschool World!

45:15.101 --> 45:16.421
We're nearly to the train!

45:16.461 --> 45:17.962
Riley, here we come! Whoo-hoo!

45:20.502 --> 45:24.046
This should be fun!
New team, new friends.

45:24.142 --> 45:25.582
These kids look pretty good,

45:25.622 --> 45:27.222
considering they're from San Francisco.

45:27.262 --> 45:28.582
Okay, Andersen, you're up!

45:28.622 --> 45:30.222
- Got to go.
- Okay.

45:30.262 --> 45:31.622
Good luck, sweetie!

45:31.662 --> 45:32.822
Luck isn't going to help us now.

45:32.862 --> 45:34.702
If she tries to use Hockey Island,
it's going down.

45:34.742 --> 45:36.462
Which is why I've recalled

45:36.502 --> 45:38.342
every hockey memory I can think of.

45:38.382 --> 45:39.582
One of these has got to work

45:39.622 --> 45:41.102
in place of the Core Memory.

45:41.142 --> 45:42.774
- She's about to play!
- Hurry!

45:49.542 --> 45:52.813
Ha-ha! We did it, gang! It's working!

45:52.862 --> 45:54.164
Oh!

45:55.942 --> 45:57.622
Line change! Line change!

45:57.662 --> 45:59.772
Change it up!

46:04.423 --> 46:06.647
No! No! Aah!

46:11.783 --> 46:13.383
It's like
we don't learn anything.

46:13.423 --> 46:15.423
- Come on!
- Let's pick it up out there!

46:15.463 --> 46:17.143
Pass! Shoot it! Shoot it!

46:17.183 --> 46:18.531
Oh!

46:20.543 --> 46:22.023
- That's it!
- No, no, no! Breathe.

46:22.063 --> 46:23.889
Find your happy place.

46:26.823 --> 46:29.252
What's her problem?

46:35.623 --> 46:37.583
- Riley. What's wrong?
- Let's go.

46:37.623 --> 46:39.023
You're not going to finish tryouts?

46:39.063 --> 46:40.423
- What's the point?
- Hey.

46:40.463 --> 46:42.583
It'll be all right. Let's just go back...

46:42.623 --> 46:44.813
Stop saying everything will be all right!

46:46.743 --> 46:48.649
Nice hustle, ladies!

46:56.304 --> 46:57.652
Hockey?

47:00.504 --> 47:04.969
Oh, no, no, she loves hockey.
She can't give up hockey.

47:05.024 --> 47:06.144
Hey! Look at that!

47:06.184 --> 47:07.424
- Very nice shot!
- Hey!

47:07.464 --> 47:09.184
Bing Bong, we have to
get to that station.

47:09.224 --> 47:10.304
Sure thing. This way,

47:10.344 --> 47:12.295
just past Graham Cracker Castle. Hey.

47:12.344 --> 47:13.424
That's weird.

47:13.464 --> 47:14.944
Graham Cracker Castle
used to be right here.

47:14.984 --> 47:17.384
I wonder why
they moved it? Wow, that's not...

47:17.424 --> 47:19.904
I would have sworn
Sparkle Pony Mountain was right here.

47:19.944 --> 47:21.624
- Hey, what's going on?
- Yeah, yeah... I don't know...

47:21.664 --> 47:24.246
- We'll have to come back.
- Princess Dream World!

47:26.144 --> 47:29.096
Oh, no! The stuffed
Animal Hall of Fame!

47:30.625 --> 47:32.132
My rocket!

47:32.585 --> 47:34.745
Wait! Riley and I,
we're still using that rocket!

47:34.785 --> 47:37.385
It still has some song power left!

47:37.425 --> 47:39.326
<i>♪ Who's your friend who likes to play? ♪</i>

47:45.345 --> 47:49.065
No! No, no, no. No, you can't
take my rocket to the dump!

47:49.105 --> 47:50.896
Riley and I are going to the moon!

47:52.185 --> 47:53.487
Oh!

47:56.465 --> 47:58.768
Riley can't be done with me.

48:04.745 --> 48:08.345
Hey, it's going to be okay!
We can fix this!

48:08.385 --> 48:10.265
We just need to
get back to Headquarters.

48:10.305 --> 48:11.745
Which way to the train station?

48:11.785 --> 48:14.328
I had a whole trip planned for us.

48:15.066 --> 48:17.746
Hey, who's ticklish, huh?

48:17.786 --> 48:20.169
Here comes the tickle monster!

48:21.626 --> 48:23.167
Hey, Bing Bong! Look at this!

48:26.146 --> 48:27.266
Oh! Here's a fun game!

48:27.306 --> 48:31.426
You point to the train station
and we all go there!

48:31.466 --> 48:34.896
Won't that be fun? Come on,
let's go to the train station!

48:36.466 --> 48:38.496
I'm sorry they took your rocket.

48:39.266 --> 48:41.376
They took something that you loved.

48:41.946 --> 48:43.826
It's gone. Forever.

48:43.866 --> 48:45.946
Sadness. Don't make him feel worse.

48:45.986 --> 48:47.066
Sorry.

48:47.106 --> 48:49.057
It's all I had left of Riley.

48:49.466 --> 48:52.293
I bet you and Riley
had great adventures.

48:52.346 --> 48:54.426
Oh, they were wonderful.

48:54.466 --> 48:56.186
Once we flew back in time.

48:56.226 --> 48:58.227
We had breakfast twice that day.

48:58.267 --> 48:59.387
Sadness...

48:59.427 --> 49:02.095
It sounds amazing. I bet Riley liked it.

49:02.347 --> 49:06.130
Oh, she did.
We were best friends.

49:06.867 --> 49:09.057
Yeah. It's sad.

49:14.587 --> 49:15.889
Wh...

49:21.427 --> 49:22.889
I'm okay now.

49:24.267 --> 49:27.492
Come on. The train station is this way.

49:33.787 --> 49:35.067
How did you do that?

49:35.107 --> 49:37.307
Oh, I don't know. He was sad.

49:37.347 --> 49:38.587
So I listened to what...

49:38.627 --> 49:40.737
Hey! There's the train!

49:51.588 --> 49:55.450
Oh! We made it!
We're finally going to get home!

49:56.308 --> 49:59.788
Oh, no! These Facts and Opinions
look so similar.

49:59.828 --> 50:02.291
Oh, don't worry about it.
Happens all the time.

50:06.788 --> 50:07.948
On a scale of one to ten,

50:07.988 --> 50:09.468
I give this day an F.

50:09.508 --> 50:12.388
Well, why don't we quit standing
around and do something?

50:12.428 --> 50:13.508
Like what, genius?

50:13.548 --> 50:15.708
Like quitting. That's what I'm doing.

50:15.748 --> 50:17.588
Sure it's the coward's way out.

50:17.628 --> 50:19.897
But this coward's gonna survive.

50:21.788 --> 50:23.090
Ow!

50:27.589 --> 50:29.415
Emotions can't quit, genius!

50:30.429 --> 50:33.301
Ugh! I thought we were supposed to
be keeping Riley happy.

50:33.709 --> 50:35.455
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

50:36.349 --> 50:37.776
Mmm.

50:38.669 --> 50:40.813
Aha!

50:41.109 --> 50:42.650
- What is it?
- Oh, nothing.

50:42.709 --> 50:45.012
- Just the best idea ever.
- What?

50:45.069 --> 50:46.429
All the good Core Memories

50:46.469 --> 50:47.749
were made in Minnesota.

50:47.789 --> 50:50.869
Ergo, we go back to Minnesota
and make more.

50:50.909 --> 50:52.109
- Ta-da!
- Wait, wait, wait.

50:52.149 --> 50:54.149
You're saying we run away?

50:54.189 --> 50:55.509
Well, I wouldn't call it that.

50:55.549 --> 50:58.269
I'd call it the Happy Core
Memory Development program.

50:58.309 --> 50:59.509
You can't be serious.

50:59.549 --> 51:00.989
Hey! Our life was perfect

51:01.029 --> 51:03.389
until Mom and Dad decided to move to

51:03.429 --> 51:05.109
San Fran Stinktown.

51:05.149 --> 51:07.349
I mean,
it's just so drastic!

51:07.389 --> 51:09.670
Need I remind you
of how great things were there?

51:09.710 --> 51:11.390
Our room? Our back yard?

51:11.430 --> 51:12.732
Our friends?

51:14.150 --> 51:15.870
<i>♪ TripleDent gum
♪ Will make you smile ♪</i>

51:15.910 --> 51:18.190
Did I ask for the gum commercial?

51:18.230 --> 51:19.870
Anyway, it was better, that's my point.

51:19.910 --> 51:22.390
Yeah, Riley was happier in Minnesota.

51:22.430 --> 51:24.830
Wait. Hold on. Shouldn't we
just sleep on this or something?

51:24.870 --> 51:26.430
Fine. Let's sleep on it.

51:26.470 --> 51:29.470
Because, hey,
I'm sure jolly fun-filled times

51:29.510 --> 51:31.700
are just around the corner.

51:37.870 --> 51:39.218
Huh?

51:43.830 --> 51:45.510
Hey, hey! Why aren't we moving?

51:45.550 --> 51:48.058
Riley's gone to sleep.
We're all on break.

51:48.110 --> 51:49.790
You mean we're stuck
here until morning?

51:49.830 --> 51:51.751
Yeah, the Train of Thought
doesn't run while she's asleep.

51:51.791 --> 51:53.378
Oh, we can't wait that long.

51:53.511 --> 51:56.391
- How about we wake her up?
- Sadness, that's ridiculous!

51:56.431 --> 51:58.302
How could we possibly...

51:59.791 --> 52:01.111
How about we wake her up?

52:01.151 --> 52:03.295
- Great idea, Joy.
- Thanks. Come on!

52:08.191 --> 52:10.631
Whoa! This place is huge!

52:10.671 --> 52:13.431
Yeah, it looks so much smaller
than I expected.

52:13.471 --> 52:15.271
Wow! <i>I Can Fly?</i>

52:15.311 --> 52:17.296
I love that one!

52:18.111 --> 52:20.779
Rainbow Unicorn!
She's right there!

52:23.631 --> 52:25.591
My friend says you're famous.

52:25.631 --> 52:26.711
She wants your autograph.

52:26.751 --> 52:29.431
No, no, Sadness,
don't bother Miss Unicorn, okay?

52:29.471 --> 52:30.791
Sorry, she's from out of town.

52:30.831 --> 52:32.418
That was so embarrassing, right?

52:33.831 --> 52:35.952
I loved you in
<i>Fairy Dream Adventure Part 7.</i>

52:35.992 --> 52:37.294
Okay, bye. I love you!

52:39.032 --> 52:40.632
Huh. Wonder what that means.

52:40.672 --> 52:42.213
Oh, well, let's go in.

52:44.192 --> 52:45.912
Set up the classroom set!

52:45.952 --> 52:47.112
Today's memories are in!

52:47.152 --> 52:48.952
We've got
a lot to work with here.

52:48.992 --> 52:50.392
Riley dumped her best friend,

52:50.432 --> 52:51.952
had a miserable day at school,

52:51.992 --> 52:53.072
and quit hockey.

52:53.112 --> 52:55.592
The writers have
put together a killer script!

52:55.632 --> 52:57.432
Just because Joy
and Sadness are gone,

52:57.472 --> 52:59.263
I have to do stupid Dream Duty.

53:00.912 --> 53:02.792
Okay. How are we going to wake her up?

53:02.832 --> 53:05.752
Well, she wakes up sometimes
when she has a scary dream.

53:05.792 --> 53:07.472
- We could scare her.
- Scare her?

53:07.512 --> 53:09.272
No, she's been through enough already.

53:09.312 --> 53:10.832
- But, Joy...
- Sadness, you may know your way

53:10.872 --> 53:12.792
around down here, but I know Riley.

53:12.832 --> 53:14.112
We're gonna make her so happy,

53:14.152 --> 53:16.352
she'll wake up with exhilaration.

53:16.392 --> 53:17.753
We'll excite her awake!

53:17.793 --> 53:19.633
That's never happened before.

53:19.673 --> 53:21.633
Ooh!
Riley loves dogs. Put this on.

53:21.673 --> 53:22.833
I don't think that'll work.

53:22.873 --> 53:24.374
- Bing Bong?
- Yeah?

53:24.473 --> 53:26.833
Don't let anything happen to these.

53:26.873 --> 53:28.193
Got it.

53:28.233 --> 53:31.185
Mmm-hmm. Add the reality
distortion filter.

53:33.113 --> 53:35.833
Love it. Remember,
play to the camera, everyone!

53:35.873 --> 53:37.273
Riley is the camera!

53:37.313 --> 53:39.553
Makeup,
get out of there, we are on in five,

53:39.593 --> 53:41.180
four, three...

53:43.353 --> 53:44.940
Hello, class.

53:45.393 --> 53:48.673
Before we begin today's pop quiz...

53:48.713 --> 53:50.513
Man, she is one bad actress.

53:50.553 --> 53:52.583
...which counts for 90%
of your final grade,

53:52.993 --> 53:57.424
I want to introduce
our new student. Riley.

53:57.753 --> 53:59.313
Would you like to stand up

53:59.353 --> 54:01.019
- and introduce yourself?
- Camera.

54:02.554 --> 54:04.474
And cue Riley.

54:04.514 --> 54:06.114
<i>My name is Riley Andersen.</i>

54:06.154 --> 54:09.299
<i>I'm from Minnesota and now I live here.</i>

54:09.754 --> 54:11.819
Ew, look! Her teeth are falling out!

54:13.514 --> 54:14.634
- That's disgusting.
- Ew, gross!

54:14.674 --> 54:15.874
Teeth falling out.

54:15.914 --> 54:17.501
Yeah, I'm used to that one.

54:18.714 --> 54:20.194
Let me guess, we have no pants on.

54:20.234 --> 54:22.554
Hey, look!
She came to school with no pants on!

54:22.594 --> 54:24.754
- Called it!
- Ready?

54:24.794 --> 54:26.834
I don't think
this happy thing is going to work.

54:26.874 --> 54:27.994
But if we scare her...

54:28.034 --> 54:29.825
Just follow my lead. Here we go.

54:31.194 --> 54:33.224
Bark! Bark! Bark!

54:33.474 --> 54:36.062
- Who is that?
- Uh, what's going on?

54:42.234 --> 54:43.900
Psst! You're on! Go!

54:44.394 --> 54:46.235
Whoo! Let's party!

54:46.275 --> 54:48.155
Let's dance! Whoo!

54:48.195 --> 54:49.577
Hey, a party.

54:50.755 --> 54:51.955
Bark, bark, bark!

54:51.995 --> 54:54.219
Joy, this isn't working.

54:55.675 --> 54:57.023
Huh!

54:59.995 --> 55:01.795
Huh? Sadness, what are you doing?

55:01.835 --> 55:04.457
Come back here!

55:04.715 --> 55:07.257
It's just a dream,
it's just a dream. It's just a dream.

55:08.795 --> 55:11.576
They're trying to wake her up.
Call security!

55:12.435 --> 55:14.181
Hi, Riley, it's me!

55:14.355 --> 55:15.555
<i>- ♪ Who's your friend</i>
- Bing Bong?

55:15.595 --> 55:16.915
<i>♪ Who likes to play?
Bing Bong, Bing Bong! a'</i>

55:16.955 --> 55:18.635
Sadness, stop! It was working!

55:18.675 --> 55:19.977
Ow.

55:20.395 --> 55:22.675
Sadness! You are ruining this dream!
You're scaring her!

55:22.715 --> 55:24.017
But look, it's working!

55:25.075 --> 55:26.115
Whoa.

55:26.155 --> 55:28.186
They are not
part of this dream. Get them!

55:28.556 --> 55:30.621
- Stop right there!
- Ow!

55:31.796 --> 55:33.144
Pan away! Pan away!

55:37.236 --> 55:39.356
Boo! Pick a plotline!

55:39.396 --> 55:41.236
- Ow! Careful!
- Hold still!

55:41.276 --> 55:42.556
You can't do this!

55:42.596 --> 55:44.740
I know people in Headquarters!

55:46.836 --> 55:50.027
Ow! Cut that out!
Ow! Please!

55:50.356 --> 55:51.956
Do you like candy? You look hungry.

55:51.996 --> 55:54.076
I get you candy! Oh no!

55:54.116 --> 55:55.916
No, no. No, no!

55:55.956 --> 55:57.956
There go the Core Memories!

55:57.996 --> 55:59.876
I can't go in there!
I'm scared of the dark!

55:59.916 --> 56:01.236
Please!

56:01.276 --> 56:02.658
Oh, come on.

56:04.596 --> 56:05.756
What is this place?

56:05.796 --> 56:07.036
The Subconscious.

56:07.076 --> 56:09.379
It's where they take
all the troublemakers.

56:14.317 --> 56:15.357
My hat feels loose.

56:15.397 --> 56:16.677
Mmm. How do we get in?

56:16.717 --> 56:17.837
Let me see.

56:17.877 --> 56:19.938
You got my hat?
Or is that your hat?

56:20.117 --> 56:21.157
Yeah, it's my hat.

56:21.197 --> 56:23.277
You sure? I don't know,
look in the label.

56:23.317 --> 56:25.597
- Yeah, it says, "My hat."
- Wait, it says, "My hat"?

56:25.637 --> 56:27.477
- My hat, it says.
- That's what I wrote in my hat.

56:27.517 --> 56:28.837
- What are you talking about?
- You've got my hat on.

56:28.877 --> 56:30.837
Okay, but it's my handwriting.

56:30.877 --> 56:33.260
- Hey! You!
- Oh! You caught us!

56:34.157 --> 56:35.437
Get back in there!

56:35.477 --> 56:37.268
No escaping!

56:46.237 --> 56:47.437
I don't like it here.

56:47.477 --> 56:49.667
It's where they keep
Riley's darkest fears.

56:52.677 --> 56:54.503
It's broccoli.

56:56.998 --> 56:58.739
The stairs to the basement!

57:01.038 --> 57:02.864
Grandma's vacuum cleaner!

57:11.238 --> 57:12.745
Okay, come on.

57:14.278 --> 57:15.398
Would you walk quieter?

57:15.438 --> 57:16.740
I'm trying.

57:16.918 --> 57:18.219
What is going...

57:20.118 --> 57:22.421
Candy wrappers?

57:32.198 --> 57:34.398
- Bing Bong!
- Joy?

57:34.438 --> 57:36.741
- There you are.
- Shhh!

57:42.479 --> 57:44.111
It's Jangles.

57:44.239 --> 57:46.460
Who's the birthday girl?
Who's the birthday girl?

57:58.279 --> 57:59.679
Do you have the Core Memories?

57:59.719 --> 58:01.119
Yeah.

58:01.159 --> 58:03.462
All he cared about was the candy!

58:04.359 --> 58:05.707
Shh.

58:20.999 --> 58:23.542
We're out of here! Let's get to that train!

58:23.920 --> 58:26.160
Wait! The train's not running.

58:26.200 --> 58:28.000
We still have to wake up Riley.

58:28.040 --> 58:29.422
But how?

58:32.240 --> 58:33.667
Oh, no!

58:51.320 --> 58:52.480
Hey, Sadness.

58:52.520 --> 58:55.920
Did you hear
about the pa-pa-party they were having?

58:55.960 --> 58:57.760
Oh, yeah. Oh, yes, Joy.

58:57.800 --> 59:00.600
Isn't it a birthday party?

59:00.640 --> 59:01.840
Did you say

59:01.880 --> 59:03.680
birthday?

59:03.720 --> 59:05.681
And there's going to be
cake and presents.

59:05.721 --> 59:06.961
And games and balloons...

59:07.001 --> 59:08.641
A birthday?

59:08.681 --> 59:10.472
Okay. Follow us!

59:12.361 --> 59:14.441
Nothing like a good scare
to wake you up, right?

59:14.481 --> 59:15.841
Okay, but it's my handwriting.

59:15.881 --> 59:17.441
No it isn't. That's my... I wrote that.

59:17.481 --> 59:19.142
No, but this one's my handwriting.

59:37.881 --> 59:40.389
Who's the birthday girl?

59:44.841 --> 59:46.712
- Whoo-hoo!
- Come on, let's go!

59:53.242 --> 59:55.591
Ha-ha! We made it!

59:56.202 --> 59:58.551
Guess who's on their way
to Headquarters!

59:58.602 --> 59:59.904
We are!

59:59.962 --> 01:00:01.753
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo!

01:00:06.642 --> 01:00:09.242
- What is going on?
- He did it again!

01:00:09.282 --> 01:00:11.722
We were at school, and we were
naked, and there was a dog,

01:00:11.762 --> 01:00:15.122
and his back half was chasing him
and then we saw Bing Bong!

01:00:15.162 --> 01:00:17.282
You idiot! It was a dream!

01:00:17.322 --> 01:00:18.562
This is ridiculous!

01:00:18.602 --> 01:00:20.746
We can't even get
a good night's sleep anymore.

01:00:21.362 --> 01:00:22.903
Time to take action.

01:00:23.482 --> 01:00:25.402
Stupid Mom and Dad.
If they hadn't moved us,

01:00:25.442 --> 01:00:27.074
none of this would've happened.

01:00:27.282 --> 01:00:28.630
Who's with me?

01:00:28.722 --> 01:00:30.388
Um...

01:00:30.482 --> 01:00:31.909
No no no no no.

01:00:32.083 --> 01:00:33.795
Yeah. Let's do it.

01:00:46.323 --> 01:00:48.513
She took it. There's no turning back.

01:00:48.603 --> 01:00:51.163
So how are we going
to get to Minnesota from here?

01:00:51.203 --> 01:00:52.283
Well, why don't we go down

01:00:52.323 --> 01:00:54.283
to the elephant lot and rent an elephant?

01:00:54.323 --> 01:00:55.723
Hey. That sounds nice.

01:00:55.763 --> 01:00:57.475
We're taking the bus, nitwit!

01:00:59.363 --> 01:01:01.323
There's a bus
leaving tomorrow. Perfect!

01:01:01.363 --> 01:01:03.712
A ticket costs money.
How do we get money?

01:01:03.843 --> 01:01:05.843
- Mom's purse.
- You wouldn't.

01:01:05.883 --> 01:01:08.949
Oh, but I would.
Where was it we saw it last?

01:01:10.323 --> 01:01:11.563
<i>- ♪ TripleDent gum ♪</i>
- No!

01:01:11.603 --> 01:01:13.963
It's downstairs somewhere.

01:01:14.003 --> 01:01:15.684
Mom and Dad got us into this mess.

01:01:15.724 --> 01:01:17.470
They can pay to get us out.

01:01:20.364 --> 01:01:22.324
How about this, huh? Isn't this nice?

01:01:22.364 --> 01:01:24.364
You can see everything from up here.

01:01:24.404 --> 01:01:26.484
Look, there's Inductive Reasoning.

01:01:26.524 --> 01:01:27.644
There's Déjà Vu.

01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:29.284
There's Language Processing.

01:01:29.324 --> 01:01:30.564
There's Déjà Vu.

01:01:30.604 --> 01:01:31.804
There's Critical Thinking.

01:01:31.844 --> 01:01:33.385
There's Déjà Vu.

01:01:33.444 --> 01:01:35.190
Hey, look at this, guys! Memories!

01:01:36.524 --> 01:01:38.793
Hey. That was a good idea.

01:01:39.004 --> 01:01:41.114
About scaring Riley awake.

01:01:41.204 --> 01:01:42.586
You're not so bad.

01:01:42.684 --> 01:01:43.986
Really?

01:01:44.284 --> 01:01:45.666
Nice work.

01:01:46.524 --> 01:01:49.004
Oh, I can't wait
to get the old Riley back.

01:01:49.044 --> 01:01:50.124
As soon as we get there,

01:01:50.164 --> 01:01:51.830
I'm going to fix this whole mess.

01:01:52.044 --> 01:01:53.506
Whoa. Is this Riley?

01:01:53.724 --> 01:01:56.164
She's so big now.
She won't fit in my rocket.

01:01:56.204 --> 01:01:57.604
How are we gonna get to the moon?

01:01:57.644 --> 01:02:00.517
Oh, it's that time
in the twisty tree, remember?

01:02:00.565 --> 01:02:02.165
The hockey team showed up

01:02:02.205 --> 01:02:04.508
and Mom and Dad were there cheering.

01:02:04.645 --> 01:02:07.267
Look at her,
having fun and laughing.

01:02:07.725 --> 01:02:09.485
Oh, I love this one.

01:02:09.525 --> 01:02:11.874
Hmm. I love that one, too.

01:02:12.125 --> 01:02:14.205
Atta girl! Now you're getting it!

01:02:14.245 --> 01:02:16.605
Yeah. It was the day the Prairie Dogs

01:02:16.645 --> 01:02:18.445
lost the big playoff game.

01:02:18.485 --> 01:02:20.245
Riley missed the winning shot.

01:02:20.285 --> 01:02:22.714
She felt awful. She wanted to quit.

01:02:24.245 --> 01:02:27.152
Sorry. I went sad again, didn't I?

01:02:27.925 --> 01:02:31.389
I'll tell you what. We can keep working
on that when we get back. Okay?

01:02:31.925 --> 01:02:33.273
Okay.

01:02:35.005 --> 01:02:36.626
But I just don't understand.

01:02:39.085 --> 01:02:41.388
Why did our moving van
even go to Texas?

01:02:46.046 --> 01:02:47.587
Multiple customers?

01:02:54.526 --> 01:02:57.034
Well, we were promised
delivery on the fifth.

01:03:00.766 --> 01:03:02.068
Uh-huh.

01:03:07.206 --> 01:03:10.431
Excuse me,
isn't there any way that you can rush it?

01:03:15.486 --> 01:03:16.948
Honesty Island?

01:03:24.966 --> 01:03:26.269
Look out!

01:03:32.567 --> 01:03:34.029
Come on!

01:03:37.487 --> 01:03:39.472
Hold on!

01:03:39.847 --> 01:03:41.367
Hurry up! Come on! Over here!

01:03:41.407 --> 01:03:43.472
Come on, people!
Let's, go, go, go!

01:03:55.447 --> 01:03:56.954
That was our way home.

01:03:57.287 --> 01:03:59.847
We lost another island?
What is happening?

01:03:59.887 --> 01:04:02.873
Haven't you heard?
Riley's running away.

01:04:03.327 --> 01:04:04.629
What?

01:04:05.767 --> 01:04:07.832
Wait, wait, hang on, guys.

01:04:08.407 --> 01:04:09.949
Are we really doing this?

01:04:10.008 --> 01:04:11.608
- I mean, this is serious.
- Look.

01:04:11.648 --> 01:04:12.888
We have no Core Memories.

01:04:12.928 --> 01:04:14.408
You want Riley to be happy?

01:04:14.448 --> 01:04:16.831
Let's get back to Minnesota
and make more.

01:04:18.168 --> 01:04:20.949
Joy, if we hurry, we can still stop her.

01:04:22.408 --> 01:04:24.074
Family Island. Let's go!

01:04:37.968 --> 01:04:40.528
Joy! Joy!

01:04:40.568 --> 01:04:41.728
It's too dangerous!

01:04:41.768 --> 01:04:43.989
We won't make it in time.

01:04:46.888 --> 01:04:48.520
But that's our only way back!

01:05:00.889 --> 01:05:02.476
A recall tube!

01:05:04.889 --> 01:05:06.680
We can get recalled!

01:05:10.009 --> 01:05:12.039
Have a great day, sweetheart.

01:05:12.209 --> 01:05:14.049
See you after school, monkey.

01:05:14.089 --> 01:05:15.437
We love you!

01:05:19.689 --> 01:05:21.151
Go! Run, run! Go!

01:05:31.449 --> 01:05:34.435
Whoa! Whoa! Sadness! Sadness, stop!

01:05:35.370 --> 01:05:36.570
You're hurting Riley!

01:05:36.610 --> 01:05:38.754
Oh, no, no, no! I did it again!

01:05:38.890 --> 01:05:40.130
If you get in here,

01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:42.633
these Core Memories will get sad.

01:05:48.130 --> 01:05:51.410
I'm sorry. Riley needs to be happy.

01:05:51.450 --> 01:05:52.912
Joy?

01:06:06.810 --> 01:06:08.636
Joy!

01:06:12.810 --> 01:06:14.112
Joy!

01:06:46.411 --> 01:06:47.759
Joy?

01:06:54.531 --> 01:06:55.833
Joy!

01:07:02.252 --> 01:07:04.715
Joy, what are you doing?
Will you stop it, please?

01:07:09.172 --> 01:07:12.477
Don't you get it, Joy?
We're stuck down here.

01:07:13.132 --> 01:07:14.514
We're forgotten.

01:07:22.532 --> 01:07:25.234
We used to play tag and stuff.

01:07:29.212 --> 01:07:31.481
But everything's different now.

01:07:33.732 --> 01:07:35.239
Since we moved.

01:08:06.173 --> 01:08:09.053
Do you remember how she used to

01:08:09.093 --> 01:08:11.874
stick her tongue out
when she was coloring?

01:08:21.372 --> 01:08:24.803
I could listen to her stories all day.

01:08:38.214 --> 01:08:41.121
I just wanted Riley to be happy.

01:08:44.094 --> 01:08:45.680
And now...

01:09:42.295 --> 01:09:43.935
<i>It was the day
the Prairie Dogs</i>

01:09:43.975 --> 01:09:46.005
<i>lost the big playoff game.</i>

01:09:46.575 --> 01:09:49.845
<i>Riley missed the winning shot.
She felt awful.</i>

01:09:50.455 --> 01:09:52.167
<i>She wanted to quit.</i>

01:10:10.056 --> 01:10:11.404
Sadness.

01:10:12.776 --> 01:10:16.126
Mom and Dad... The team...

01:10:17.016 --> 01:10:21.038
They came to help because of Sadness.

01:10:26.976 --> 01:10:28.688
We have to get back up there.

01:10:29.576 --> 01:10:31.686
Joy, we're stuck down here.

01:10:32.656 --> 01:10:34.925

01:13:56.621 --> 01:13:58.101
Wait, is that someone
walking towards us?

01:13:58.141 --> 01:13:59.603
Yep, let's cross the street.

01:14:03.981 --> 01:14:05.661
It's Mom. She's onto us!

01:14:05.701 --> 01:14:06.861
- What do we do?
- Where's my bag?

01:14:06.901 --> 01:14:08.581
Riley needs to get Core Memories.

01:14:08.621 --> 01:14:10.606
- That's the stuff.
- We keep going.

01:14:13.421 --> 01:14:14.803
Sadness!

01:14:25.222 --> 01:14:27.207
Sadness! Sadness?

01:14:27.582 --> 01:14:30.422
Come on, Sadness.
Where are you? Okay.

01:14:30.462 --> 01:14:32.731
If I were Sadness, where would I be?

01:14:32.902 --> 01:14:37.902
Oh. Everything is awful
and my legs don't work,

01:14:37.942 --> 01:14:41.486
and you have to drag me around
while I touch all the...

01:14:57.222 --> 01:14:59.207
Oh, no! It's Mom again! What do we do?

01:15:05.703 --> 01:15:07.983
This is madness!
She shouldn't run away!

01:15:08.023 --> 01:15:10.326
Let's get this idea
out of her head.

01:15:10.423 --> 01:15:11.805
Sadness?

01:15:11.943 --> 01:15:14.167
Sadness!

01:15:14.863 --> 01:15:16.165
Joy?

01:15:16.703 --> 01:15:18.369
Wait! Sadness!

01:15:18.463 --> 01:15:22.503
Just let me go!
Riley's better off without me!

01:15:22.543 --> 01:15:23.844
Come back!

01:15:28.863 --> 01:15:30.463
Okay, you're saying your husband

01:15:30.503 --> 01:15:32.343
was blown away by an elephant.

01:15:32.383 --> 01:15:33.503
Was he with anyone?

01:15:33.543 --> 01:15:35.023
Yes! And there she is!

01:15:35.063 --> 01:15:36.423
Hey! Come back here!

01:15:36.463 --> 01:15:38.892
Forget it, Jake. It's Cloud Town.

01:15:41.623 --> 01:15:44.144
Oh! What? Sadness!

01:15:44.184 --> 01:15:47.184
I only make
everything worse!

01:15:47.224 --> 01:15:49.687
Wait! Sadness!
We got to get you back to...

01:15:59.704 --> 01:16:01.384
- It's stuck!
- Oh, great.

01:16:01.424 --> 01:16:03.384
- What do you mean it's stuck?
- Now what?

01:16:03.424 --> 01:16:05.727
Oh, no no no no! What is this?

01:16:14.504 --> 01:16:15.984
- How do we stop it?
- I got it!

01:16:16.024 --> 01:16:18.024
Make her feel scared!
That'll make her change her mind!

01:16:18.064 --> 01:16:19.904
- Brilliant!
- I know it's brilliant! Do it!

01:16:19.944 --> 01:16:22.064
Ah! Nothing's working!
Why isn't it working?

01:16:22.104 --> 01:16:23.384
- Let me try.
- Great! You broke it!

01:16:23.424 --> 01:16:24.544
No, I didn't! Don't touch that!

01:16:24.584 --> 01:16:26.806
Let me do it! Get out of here!

01:16:29.785 --> 01:16:32.976
Guys, we can't make Riley feel anything.

01:16:34.425 --> 01:16:36.091
What have we done?

01:16:36.665 --> 01:16:38.225
Hey! Hey, look at me!

01:16:38.265 --> 01:16:39.745
Did you mean what you said before?

01:16:39.785 --> 01:16:42.105
I would die for Riley!
I would die for Riley!

01:16:42.145 --> 01:16:44.130
Yeah, okay, haircut. Time to prove it.

01:16:47.625 --> 01:16:49.585
I would die for Riley!
I would die for Riley!

01:16:49.625 --> 01:16:52.406
I would die for Riley!

01:17:08.025 --> 01:17:09.931
That's it! I fold!

01:17:27.346 --> 01:17:28.426
Whoa!

01:17:28.466 --> 01:17:30.576
Whoa.

01:17:31.706 --> 01:17:32.786
Whoa!

01:17:32.826 --> 01:17:34.652
Whoa!

01:17:40.586 --> 01:17:44.812
This is crazy. This is crazy.
No, no, no. Joy. Be positive.

01:17:47.986 --> 01:17:50.176
I am positive this is crazy!

01:17:54.427 --> 01:17:57.334
- Now!
- For Riley!

01:18:04.867 --> 01:18:06.772
- Joy?
- Hang on!

01:18:08.027 --> 01:18:10.296
Oh, I wish Joy was here!

01:18:17.227 --> 01:18:18.689
It's Joy!

01:18:19.187 --> 01:18:20.694
Stand back!

01:18:21.627 --> 01:18:22.707
That worked.

01:18:22.747 --> 01:18:25.210
Well, what would you do,
if you're so smart?

01:18:25.387 --> 01:18:28.107
I'd tell you,
but you're too dumb to understand.

01:18:28.147 --> 01:18:30.987
- What?
- Of course your tiny brain is confused.

01:18:31.027 --> 01:18:33.808
Guess I'll just have to
dumb it down to your level.

01:18:33.947 --> 01:18:35.987
Sorry I don't speak moron
as well as you,

01:18:36.027 --> 01:18:38.297
but let me try. Duh!

01:18:47.788 --> 01:18:49.148
Oh, thank goodness you're back!

01:18:49.188 --> 01:18:51.188
- Things are really messed up!
- We found this idea.

01:18:51.228 --> 01:18:53.497
We were just trying to
make happy memories.

01:19:02.988 --> 01:19:04.508
Joy, you got to fix this! Get up there!

01:19:04.548 --> 01:19:06.268
Sadness, it's up to you.

01:19:06.308 --> 01:19:08.498
- Me?
- Sadness?

01:19:08.628 --> 01:19:09.868
I can't, Joy.

01:19:09.908 --> 01:19:12.815
Yes, you can. Riley needs you.

01:19:24.589 --> 01:19:26.016
Okay.

01:19:46.269 --> 01:19:49.176
Wait! Stop! I want to get off!

01:20:00.629 --> 01:20:02.349
All right. Thank you. We will.

01:20:02.389 --> 01:20:04.750
Her teacher hasn't even
seen Riley all day.

01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:05.950
- What?
- What was she wearing last?

01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:08.150
- Do you even remember what...
- I can't believe this.

01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:09.430
Riley, there you are!
Thank goodness!

01:20:09.470 --> 01:20:10.630
We were worried sick!

01:20:10.670 --> 01:20:12.150
Where have you been? It's so late!

01:20:12.190 --> 01:20:14.310
Oh, honey!
What happened? Are you all right?

01:20:14.350 --> 01:20:16.390
We asked the neighbors,
I called the school,

01:20:16.430 --> 01:20:18.062
we talked to your teacher.

01:21:44.432 --> 01:21:47.976
I know you don't want me to but...

01:21:48.872 --> 01:21:50.504
I miss home.

01:21:52.192 --> 01:21:54.063
I miss Minnesota.

01:21:57.192 --> 01:22:00.622
You need me to be happy, but...

01:22:02.232 --> 01:22:06.982
I want my old friends,
and my hockey team.

01:22:09.112 --> 01:22:10.903
I want to go home.

01:22:12.592 --> 01:22:14.384
Please don't be mad.

01:22:17.153 --> 01:22:18.673
Oh, sweetie.

01:22:18.713 --> 01:22:20.300
We're not mad.

01:22:21.753 --> 01:22:25.501
You know what? I miss Minnesota too.

01:22:27.033 --> 01:22:29.940
I miss the woods where we took hikes.

01:22:30.353 --> 01:22:33.100
And the backyard
where you used to play.

01:22:33.553 --> 01:22:36.824
Spring Lake,
where you learned to skate.

01:22:38.633 --> 01:22:40.095
Come here.

01:24:01.275 --> 01:24:02.995
Hey, I'm liking this new view.

01:24:03.035 --> 01:24:04.515
Friendship Island has expanded.

01:24:04.555 --> 01:24:07.155
Glad they finally opened
that Friendly Argument section.

01:24:07.195 --> 01:24:09.355
I like Tragic Vampire Romance Island.

01:24:09.395 --> 01:24:12.075
Fashion Island? Oh. Everyone shut up.

01:24:12.115 --> 01:24:14.355
Boy Band Island?
Hope that's just a phase.

01:24:14.395 --> 01:24:17.586
Say what you want,
I think it's all beautiful.

01:24:18.515 --> 01:24:19.795
All right. Here you go.

01:24:19.835 --> 01:24:22.715
Your new expanded console
is up and runnin'.

01:24:22.755 --> 01:24:24.236
- Ooh!
- Wow!

01:24:24.276 --> 01:24:25.676
- Cool! Upgrade!
- Ooh!

01:24:25.716 --> 01:24:26.876
Hey! Whoa-ho!

01:24:26.916 --> 01:24:28.537
Whoops, wait. Did I just do that?

01:24:29.476 --> 01:24:30.676
Hey. guys? What's pub-er-ty?

01:24:30.716 --> 01:24:32.756
I don't know. It's probably not important.

01:24:32.796 --> 01:24:36.876
Whoa. I have access to
the entire curse word library!

01:24:36.916 --> 01:24:38.742
This new console is the...

01:24:40.276 --> 01:24:41.756
Sorry. I did it again. My bad.

01:24:41.796 --> 01:24:43.217
They're getting to the rink.

01:24:44.876 --> 01:24:46.436
Now when you get out there,
you be aggressive!

01:24:46.476 --> 01:24:48.276
- I know, Dad.
- But not too aggressive.

01:24:48.316 --> 01:24:50.996
You know, you guys don't
have to come to every game.

01:24:51.036 --> 01:24:52.956
Are you kidding? I'm not missing one!

01:24:52.996 --> 01:24:54.076
Go Foghorns!

01:24:54.116 --> 01:24:56.076
Go Riley! Foghorns are the best!

01:24:56.116 --> 01:24:58.226
Okay! I got to go!

01:24:58.676 --> 01:24:59.956
- Aw!
- They love us.

01:24:59.996 --> 01:25:01.676
Yeah, Mom and Dad are pretty cool.

01:25:01.716 --> 01:25:04.463
Guys, of course they are.
But we can't show it.

01:25:06.476 --> 01:25:07.917
She loved the face painting!

01:25:07.957 --> 01:25:09.783
Ha! Told you it was a great idea!

01:25:10.517 --> 01:25:12.277
Best idea he's had in a while.

01:25:12.317 --> 01:25:14.108
He's a really good guy.

01:25:18.477 --> 01:25:19.939
Just in case.

01:25:20.957 --> 01:25:22.259
Oh!

01:25:23.557 --> 01:25:24.859
Sorry.

01:25:28.837 --> 01:25:31.425
<i>Girl! Girl! Girl!</i>

01:25:32.677 --> 01:25:35.822
Uh... Okay. Bye.

01:25:37.397 --> 01:25:40.197
Remember, just hustle.

01:25:40.237 --> 01:25:41.869
Go, Riley!

01:25:42.357 --> 01:25:43.898
You got this!

01:25:45.517 --> 01:25:47.317
- You ready?
- Yeah.

01:25:47.357 --> 01:25:49.797
All right. Let's play some hockey!

01:25:49.837 --> 01:25:51.958
All right, Anger, take it!

01:25:51.998 --> 01:25:53.238
Give us that puck
or you're dead meat!

01:25:53.278 --> 01:25:54.318
On our left. On our left!

01:25:54.358 --> 01:25:55.998
Let's just try not
to get all smelly this time.

01:25:56.038 --> 01:25:58.478
Oh. Mom and Dad
are watching us fail.

01:25:58.518 --> 01:25:59.900
Not for long!

01:26:01.198 --> 01:26:03.318
<i>We've been through
a lot lately, that's for sure.</i>

01:26:03.358 --> 01:26:05.158
<i>But we still love our girl.</i>

01:26:05.198 --> 01:26:08.038
<i>She has great new friends,
a great new house.</i>

01:26:08.078 --> 01:26:09.665
<i>Things couldn't be better.</i>

01:26:09.718 --> 01:26:13.819
<i>After all, Riley's twelve now.
What could happen?</i>

01:26:34.439 --> 01:26:37.759
And who can tell me what year
San Francisco was founded?

01:26:37.799 --> 01:26:39.959
Anyone? Jordan?

01:26:39.999 --> 01:26:42.029
Uh...

01:26:42.119 --> 01:26:43.719
How much more of this?

01:26:43.759 --> 01:26:45.879
Five months, two weeks and four days

01:26:45.919 --> 01:26:47.519
until summer vacation.

01:26:47.559 --> 01:26:50.943
Then it's off to the Bahamas
with you know who!

01:26:51.319 --> 01:26:54.191
<i>Come fly with me,</i> gatinha.

01:26:57.919 --> 01:26:59.710
Have a nice day.

01:27:00.399 --> 01:27:01.719
What are we mad about?

01:27:01.759 --> 01:27:03.879
I don't know.
Whatever Troy's mad about.

01:27:03.919 --> 01:27:05.199
What's Troy mad about?

01:27:05.239 --> 01:27:06.826
I don't know.

01:27:07.199 --> 01:27:08.865
I know. Totally.

01:27:09.559 --> 01:27:10.839
We're a total fraud!

01:27:10.879 --> 01:27:12.239
Do you think they can see through us?

01:27:12.279 --> 01:27:14.239
Of course not!
We're wearing eye shadow!

01:27:14.279 --> 01:27:16.309
Being cool is so exhausting.

01:27:16.799 --> 01:27:22.505
Who's the birthday girl?
Huh? Hey! Hello?

01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:27.480
Six years of drama school for this?

01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:28.947
Move it, will you?

01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:33.520
What are you doing? Come on!

01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:35.400
You know what?
This is okay. This is fine.

01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:37.600
We just need to go to our happy place.

01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:38.760

01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:40.830
No! Not this again!
