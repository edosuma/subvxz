WEBVTT

00:20.400 --> 00:22.360
A moment of your attention, please.

00:23.160 --> 00:24.080
Let's see.

00:24.920 --> 00:26.280
As you already know,

00:26.680 --> 00:28.560
we've released your colleagues.

00:29.680 --> 00:31.640
So nobody has been deceived here.

00:32.160 --> 00:33.600
We've kept our promise.

00:34.040 --> 00:34.880
Promise, my ass.

00:35.680 --> 00:36.600
And, likewise,

00:37.000 --> 00:38.720
I swear that the million euros

00:39.040 --> 00:41.600
will be sent to the addresses you gave us.

00:41.920 --> 00:43.120
Lies and more lies.

00:43.360 --> 00:46.120
TUESDAY 03:32 PM

00:46.480 --> 00:49.600
We will also keep that promise.
I give you my word.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.280
HOUR 101 OF THE HEIST

01:47.320 --> 01:48.720
Attention to all units.

01:48.840 --> 01:51.440
-No one gets in without identification.
-Copy that.

01:59.600 --> 02:00.680
Hey, you!

02:01.240 --> 02:02.360
A clown has entered.

02:03.120 --> 02:06.000
-Could be him in disguise.
-Another one is entering the E.R.

02:07.440 --> 02:08.520
What the hell is this?

02:13.600 --> 02:14.840
There are more coming in.

02:15.560 --> 02:16.960
What the hell is going on?

02:31.440 --> 02:32.840
Get those people out of there.

02:34.160 --> 02:36.320
You can't be here. Get out.

03:11.360 --> 03:13.160
GAME ROOM

03:27.200 --> 03:30.080
Who wants a super fun crazy rabbit!

03:33.880 --> 03:36.600
Inspector, they put out
an ad for a fake casting.

03:44.800 --> 03:47.120
Lobo, he might be inside the building.

04:08.600 --> 04:09.880
He's entering the room.

04:14.920 --> 04:16.920
What's going on? Somebody talk to me!

04:29.800 --> 04:31.120
False alarm. It wasn't him.

06:01.320 --> 06:03.240
Inspector, the interview on the TV.

06:03.880 --> 06:07.840
We've verified that there's
no open case against Fonollosa

06:07.920 --> 06:10.400
for human trafficking,
pimping or pedophilia.

06:10.800 --> 06:14.440
Sources say the information leaked
could be part of a scheme

06:14.520 --> 06:15.960
orchestrated by the authorities

06:16.200 --> 06:18.480
in order to reduce
the heist men popularity.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.800
The latest events and
the death of one of the kidnappers

06:22.080 --> 06:24.640
has earned them
the sympathy of the people.

06:34.080 --> 06:34.960
You missed me.

06:35.800 --> 06:36.680
Let go.

06:43.200 --> 06:44.040
Listen,

06:46.040 --> 06:48.520
when Helsinki leaves,
we take action, got it?

06:48.600 --> 06:49.960
Is it the right time?

06:50.240 --> 06:52.920
Monica, I'm carrying a gun.
He has a blank one.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
What can happen?

07:07.080 --> 07:08.800
Either you tell him or I will.

07:09.840 --> 07:10.840
I'll do it.

07:14.480 --> 07:16.680
The Professor will try
to free Tokyo.

07:31.880 --> 07:32.800
Where are you going?

07:34.600 --> 07:35.520
Hey!

07:36.080 --> 07:36.920
For fuck's sake.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.600
Where the fuck are you going?

07:42.880 --> 07:45.800
What is this, recess time?
Everyone sit down!

07:45.880 --> 07:48.160
I suggest you sit, buddy.
I'm not in the mood.

07:48.600 --> 07:51.280
You know what?
I feel like breaking some skulls.

07:51.360 --> 07:53.880
And yours is the best one to start.

07:56.440 --> 07:58.920
Try my gun.
Maybe it'll help you relax.

08:02.080 --> 08:03.000
Arturo.

08:04.040 --> 08:05.160
Little Arturo.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.800
You've got a toy pistol
and I've got a bad fucking temper.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.680
-What are you doing?
-A toy pistol?

08:12.160 --> 08:13.040
No.

08:13.600 --> 08:14.920
Doesn't look like it.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Why don't we test it?

08:18.440 --> 08:20.920
I'll give you three seconds
or so help me God...

08:21.360 --> 08:22.600
-Make it one.
-Three.

08:23.960 --> 08:24.920
Two.

08:27.680 --> 08:28.560
One.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Surprise.

08:39.560 --> 08:40.640
Cheer up, Rio.

08:41.680 --> 08:42.640
Because

08:43.000 --> 08:44.440
we can be a family again.

08:51.680 --> 08:52.600
Turn around.

08:55.720 --> 08:58.440
I said turn around.

08:59.720 --> 09:00.720
Bitch.

09:04.040 --> 09:06.480
Come on, quick. Get moving!

09:08.480 --> 09:09.720
They're going to escape.

09:11.200 --> 09:12.480
They're going to escape.

09:12.720 --> 09:13.600
Who?

09:13.680 --> 09:14.600
The hostages!

09:17.120 --> 09:20.720
Come on. We don't have all day.
Monica, open the door!

09:21.000 --> 09:23.120
Monica, don't fucking listen to him!

09:23.480 --> 09:26.040
He is taking advantage of you.
Don't do it!

09:28.160 --> 09:30.560
Quiet or you'll get shot, champ.

09:30.640 --> 09:33.480
Don't listen to him, open the door
and we'll get out of here.

09:36.080 --> 09:38.560
SECURITY SYSTEM
BLOCKING DOOR

09:47.160 --> 09:48.120
Come on.

09:56.800 --> 09:58.040
What's the matter!?

09:58.120 --> 09:59.880
-It's not opening.
-Fuck!

10:00.280 --> 10:02.440
They must have blocked the door.

10:02.600 --> 10:03.480
It was me.

10:03.640 --> 10:04.640
Get back!

10:04.720 --> 10:05.720
Arturo.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.000
Put the gun down.

10:07.720 --> 10:08.960
Put the gun down.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.120
Little Arturo.

10:12.040 --> 10:15.520
I know you love movies
but this is getting out of hand.

10:15.600 --> 10:17.400
Another step and I'll shoot him.

10:17.520 --> 10:18.680
I may not make it alive,

10:18.760 --> 10:20.640
but I'll make sure
he never smiles again.

10:21.600 --> 10:22.560
Berlin, calm down.

10:28.280 --> 10:29.200
Open the door!

10:30.080 --> 10:31.280
Okay.

10:32.320 --> 10:33.160
Take it easy.

10:34.480 --> 10:36.440
Let's talk like civilized people.

10:37.000 --> 10:37.920
Let him go.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.520
If you want to get out, I'll help you.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.920
Open the door now!

10:45.800 --> 10:47.520
No one's opening any doors here!

10:48.800 --> 10:49.720
Is that so?

10:50.920 --> 10:53.360
I'll count to five
and then I'll shoot him.

10:54.160 --> 10:56.760
I have nothing to lose
and I don't give a shit.

10:57.320 --> 10:58.680
So it's up to you!

10:59.120 --> 11:00.880
Five, four,

11:01.560 --> 11:03.080
three, two,

11:03.760 --> 11:04.680
one!

11:30.000 --> 11:31.600
How could he have found out?

11:31.800 --> 11:33.760
He had a remote-controlled GoPro camera.

11:33.960 --> 11:34.840
Bastard.

11:35.080 --> 11:36.760
We're trying to trace the signal.

11:37.040 --> 11:38.760
It's no use. It's too late.

11:39.720 --> 11:40.920
We've been deceived again.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.080
But you were right.

11:43.360 --> 11:45.720
That son of a bitch tried to kill Angel.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.200
So Angel must have come pretty close
to get that evidence.

11:49.760 --> 11:52.160
Maybe they even came face-to-face.

11:55.800 --> 11:58.480
Excuse me, but I'm exhausted.

12:21.720 --> 12:23.800
Leave your message after the beep.

12:24.840 --> 12:25.920
Salva, it's Raquel.

12:27.280 --> 12:30.080
I'm going to have a coffee at Hanoi.

12:30.400 --> 12:33.400
If you feel like it,
I could really use someone to talk to.

13:12.600 --> 13:13.480
Antonio.

13:13.800 --> 13:15.520
They left an envelope for you.

13:17.040 --> 13:18.600
-Who?
-I don't know.

13:18.720 --> 13:20.960
It was here when we opened.
What can I get you?

13:21.720 --> 13:22.600
A beer.

13:49.080 --> 13:51.040
How's your day going?

14:03.800 --> 14:05.440
I take it that it's going well.

14:07.560 --> 14:08.560
It's been awful.

14:10.040 --> 14:13.640
I set up an operation
so I could leave tomorrow with you to...

14:14.440 --> 14:15.960
these beaches, but...

14:16.800 --> 14:17.960
it was a disaster.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.920
-What can I get you?
-The same.

14:22.400 --> 14:23.360
Raquel.

14:25.240 --> 14:27.000
Sooner or later, this will end.

14:29.720 --> 14:32.120
And you and I will meet on a beach.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.120
But you have to choose a place.

14:38.440 --> 14:41.160
Okay. I just haven't had time yet.

14:41.600 --> 14:42.560
Let's see.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.200
How about we choose it together?

14:46.440 --> 14:47.520
That sounds great.

14:49.240 --> 14:52.120
-Pick one.
-Such responsibility! Let's see.

14:59.000 --> 14:59.960
Palawan.

15:00.520 --> 15:02.440
Palawan? Let's see.

15:03.600 --> 15:04.560
Amazing.

15:05.480 --> 15:06.400
Where is it?

15:07.000 --> 15:09.880
Palawan it's an island
in the Philippines.

15:12.160 --> 15:16.720
It's southwest of the archipelago,
a little to the north of Borneo.

15:16.800 --> 15:21.000
Its population is 849,000, more or less

15:21.080 --> 15:24.400
and the capital is Puerto Princesa.

15:27.400 --> 15:29.840
Angel must have come close
to get that evidence.

15:29.920 --> 15:31.680
Maybe they even came
face-to-face.

15:31.760 --> 15:33.600
Have you investigated him? I have!

15:34.400 --> 15:35.400
...my fucking job.

15:37.520 --> 15:41.200
...the white sand beaches in the tropic.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.640
You don't like the Philippines?

15:54.800 --> 15:55.760
Yes.

15:56.240 --> 15:57.080
Of course.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.360
Do you mind if I go
to the bathroom for a moment?

16:04.720 --> 16:05.640
Not at all.

16:43.800 --> 16:44.720
Suarez,

16:45.840 --> 16:46.840
one question.

16:47.440 --> 16:50.960
What color was the wig of the clown
that talked to the kid in the hospital?

16:57.400 --> 16:58.280
Orange.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.120
Are you sure?

17:21.200 --> 17:22.920
For your life to fall apart,

17:23.400 --> 17:25.120
doesn't matter if you're in a bathroom

17:28.680 --> 17:29.600
in a heist,

17:33.000 --> 17:34.760
or at the door of a penitentiary.

17:36.520 --> 17:37.560
You see,

17:38.440 --> 17:41.800
that afternoon, the misfortunes
of three women would sync up.

17:46.080 --> 17:47.680
Raquel suddenly understood

17:48.000 --> 17:51.600
that she had fallen head over heels
for Spain's most wanted heist man.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.080
She's one of them.

17:55.080 --> 17:57.720
She's with them. You all saw it!

17:58.360 --> 18:00.000
Monica Gaztambide realized

18:00.080 --> 18:02.640
that she had just become an accomplice,

18:03.800 --> 18:05.720
and that there would be no turning back.

18:08.320 --> 18:09.200
And me...

18:09.720 --> 18:12.920
I kept following the instructions
the Professor gave us in Toledo.

18:14.520 --> 18:15.840
But without any certainty.

18:17.280 --> 18:18.320
Feeling numb.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.760
Like a bottle thrown into the sea.

18:23.080 --> 18:25.560
Not knowing if someone would pick it up.

18:26.720 --> 18:27.680
If they catch you,

18:28.000 --> 18:31.840
twenty four hours after being detained,
you say you want a deal.

18:32.360 --> 18:33.760
That you will testify only

18:34.160 --> 18:36.240
before a judge,
and they will have no choice

18:36.960 --> 18:39.440
but to take you
to the National High Court and

18:40.000 --> 18:41.560
maybe during that travel,

18:43.480 --> 18:45.160
I can do something for you.

18:47.560 --> 18:48.480
There I was,

18:49.560 --> 18:51.000
on my way to the courthouse,

18:51.920 --> 18:55.600
hoping that my guardian angel would know
the route of the van

18:56.920 --> 18:58.080
and save my life again.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.640
It was hard to be hopeful in a van,

19:13.560 --> 19:15.560
prisoner and handcuffed.

19:17.280 --> 19:19.880
But it would have been worse to know that

19:20.480 --> 19:21.880
twenty kilometers from there,

19:22.720 --> 19:23.720
my guardian angel

19:24.320 --> 19:25.800
had just been discovered.

19:52.160 --> 19:53.080
Raquel.

19:53.720 --> 19:54.600
Hi, Alberto.

19:56.760 --> 19:59.760
Have you analyzed the evidence
from the fireplace in Toledo?

20:01.000 --> 20:02.960
Yes. But nothing conclusive.

20:04.080 --> 20:05.640
What do you mean?

20:05.760 --> 20:07.400
They were the remains

20:07.480 --> 20:09.480
of a sports paper
from a couple of days ago.

20:09.960 --> 20:12.320
So I don't know if it's tainted evidence

20:12.400 --> 20:14.400
or if the guy reads the paper on Sundays.

20:16.000 --> 20:16.840
Right.

20:17.560 --> 20:18.440
Hey,

20:19.520 --> 20:21.720
how exactly did the fight
with Salva happen?

20:22.000 --> 20:22.880
Damn it, Raquel,

20:24.000 --> 20:25.680
I told you it wasn't a fight.

20:26.840 --> 20:27.760
He grabbed my neck

20:27.840 --> 20:30.320
in a chokehold and I passed out.
I didn't touch him!

20:30.480 --> 20:32.120
He's a fucking ninja with glasses.

20:36.000 --> 20:36.920
Why are you asking?

20:37.800 --> 20:38.680
No reason.

20:40.920 --> 20:43.240
And you said he provoked you?

20:43.720 --> 20:44.600
Yes.

20:44.760 --> 20:47.200
He said I shared my brains with my cock

20:47.280 --> 20:49.840
and my fists, among other insults.

20:50.560 --> 20:52.880
He wanted to fight. But what for?

20:53.480 --> 20:54.480
I don't know.

20:55.000 --> 20:55.960
Bye.

21:00.400 --> 21:01.320
Alberto.

21:27.800 --> 21:29.360
Nobody touch those trays.

21:29.440 --> 21:31.120
They're off limits for now.

21:31.520 --> 21:33.040
Get prints off them

21:33.120 --> 21:36.360
and crosscheck them with the ones
from the spoon Agent Rubio brought.

21:37.080 --> 21:38.520
-Are you kidding?
-No.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.200
And then get the prints
from the co-pilot's inner door handle.

21:48.520 --> 21:49.480
-But...
-Do it!

22:01.760 --> 22:05.440
Remember, we look for a middle-aged male,
with a beard and glasses.

22:08.200 --> 22:10.240
Hey!

22:10.560 --> 22:12.960
Find out who he is
and what he's doing here.

22:14.520 --> 22:15.360
It was him.

22:17.600 --> 22:18.560
Of course it was.

22:18.680 --> 22:20.680
Do you have a phone charger?

22:20.760 --> 22:21.720
No.

22:23.400 --> 22:24.400
Do you want mine?

22:26.800 --> 22:28.720
It had been him all along.

22:30.480 --> 22:31.440
Always friendly,

22:32.720 --> 22:33.960
always smiling,

22:35.120 --> 22:36.960
always in the right place.

22:38.760 --> 22:41.320
The only civilian
who had set foot in the tent.

22:41.400 --> 22:43.040
Something's up with your daughter.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.440
The stranger
who managed to get past all her defenses.

22:53.240 --> 22:54.720
And not only as a police agent.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.120
Salva.

23:14.560 --> 23:18.640
I don't have a gift as wonderful
as these postcards but...

23:20.080 --> 23:21.320
I'll improvise a surprise.

23:25.880 --> 23:27.240
In the ladies' room.

23:30.040 --> 23:31.040
You go first.

23:31.680 --> 23:32.800
And then I'll go.

23:35.400 --> 23:36.480
Raquel.

23:39.640 --> 23:42.600
It's the middle of the day
and they know us both here.

23:43.080 --> 23:44.040
Salva.

23:47.360 --> 23:48.400
It's the first time

23:49.240 --> 23:50.800
that I'm not wearing a lifejacket

23:51.000 --> 23:52.480
and am diving into the deep end.

23:54.960 --> 23:55.840
Don't tell me

23:56.520 --> 23:57.920
there's no water in the pool.

24:03.720 --> 24:04.560
There's water.

24:08.000 --> 24:08.920
There's water.

24:13.040 --> 24:13.880
Well...

24:14.440 --> 24:16.080
Go wait for me in there.

24:49.200 --> 24:50.640
Hands against the wall.

24:53.800 --> 24:56.160
-Raquel, I don’t know...
-Hands against the wall!

24:59.320 --> 25:00.720
What are you doing?

25:00.880 --> 25:02.000
Are you carrying a gun?

25:02.080 --> 25:03.800
Why would I have a gun?

25:03.880 --> 25:04.760
Turn around.

25:07.480 --> 25:08.360
Put them on.

25:08.440 --> 25:10.240
-Is this a joke?
-Put them on!

25:10.320 --> 25:11.200
Put them on!

25:35.000 --> 25:38.760
You're under arrest for collaboration
in the heist at the Royal Mint.

25:39.800 --> 25:40.800
You see,

25:40.880 --> 25:42.200
You have the right to remain silent

25:42.280 --> 25:43.880
third time was the charm.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.400
You have the right not to testify
and to be brought before a judge.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.880
And this time she had something
stronger than a suspicion.

25:52.320 --> 25:53.360
She had a grudge.

25:54.440 --> 25:55.360
She felt anger.

25:56.720 --> 25:57.920
She felt poisoned.

26:14.720 --> 26:16.480
Helsinki felt something similar.

26:16.880 --> 26:18.400
But not because of deception,

26:18.880 --> 26:20.200
but for lack of sleep.

26:20.800 --> 26:23.520
He had slept four hours
in the last five days.

26:24.400 --> 26:26.840
Do you know what happens
when you don't sleep?

26:27.680 --> 26:30.920
Their neural connections break down
like a short-circuit.

26:31.280 --> 26:32.760
They stop secreting dopamine.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.480
They stop processing glucose.

26:34.720 --> 26:36.960
And the only information left in the brain

26:37.280 --> 26:38.160
is survival.

26:38.720 --> 26:42.160
So one thing you can't expect
from a guy who hasn't slept in five days

26:42.880 --> 26:43.720
it's patience.

26:44.600 --> 26:45.480
Come on.

26:49.920 --> 26:51.280
Take off your clothes.

27:13.800 --> 27:14.720
The t-shirt too.

27:17.520 --> 27:19.000
I have a wound on my shoulder...

27:19.080 --> 27:20.280
Take it off!

27:28.640 --> 27:30.000
And you try to steal from us.

27:30.760 --> 27:31.640
Shit.

27:33.680 --> 27:36.080
It's what we get for not killing
when we had to.

27:36.520 --> 27:37.440
What will you do?

27:40.760 --> 27:41.800
If I shoot you,

27:43.520 --> 27:44.440
you just die.

27:45.200 --> 27:46.280
You don't suffer.

27:47.320 --> 27:50.160
Now you'll wear two kilos
of explosives strapped to your body.

27:50.600 --> 27:52.760
I'll blow it up,
but you won't know when.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.160
That's a shitload of explosives.

27:55.240 --> 27:56.840
Careful, it could make a real mess.

27:58.400 --> 28:00.800
He has been
a bigger pain in the ass than the police.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.560
Oslo died because of him.

28:13.880 --> 28:16.360
Denver almost died because of him.

28:19.080 --> 28:20.040
With this

28:21.120 --> 28:22.320
we end our troubles.

28:23.400 --> 28:24.840
Right, little Arturo?

28:54.240 --> 28:55.640
If you remove the wire,

28:56.640 --> 28:57.560
it blows.

28:58.800 --> 29:00.320
Don't make sudden movements,

29:01.360 --> 29:02.320
don't sweat,

29:03.400 --> 29:04.400
don't touch yourself.

29:06.320 --> 29:07.200
Detonator.

29:17.120 --> 29:18.040
If I touch

29:19.040 --> 29:19.920
this button,

29:25.080 --> 29:26.800
Your wife won't recognize you.

29:30.040 --> 29:31.720
Minced little Arturo.

29:44.800 --> 29:46.000
Do you have a cigarette?

29:47.240 --> 29:49.360
-Do you?
-Monica, you're pregnant.

29:49.440 --> 29:51.120
I'm pregnant, kidnapped, shot.

29:51.840 --> 29:53.800
And soon accused of...

29:53.880 --> 29:55.520
collaboration in an armed robbery.

29:55.640 --> 29:56.760
Don't think the worst.

29:58.040 --> 30:00.760
Arturo will toss you a line.
He's the father, right?

30:00.840 --> 30:01.680
Which father?

30:03.000 --> 30:03.840
Which father?

30:04.400 --> 30:06.680
The one who pointed at me
like I was a kidnapper?

30:07.840 --> 30:08.720
Which father?

30:09.880 --> 30:12.120
The one who's head I busted in
with an iron rod?

30:13.440 --> 30:15.200
Maybe my colleagues will help me.

30:15.600 --> 30:17.920
I only screwed up their escape plan,

30:18.480 --> 30:20.080
which I'm sure I'll get tried for.

30:20.800 --> 30:22.960
Why am I so stupid?
What was I thinking?

30:23.720 --> 30:25.080
Come on, give me a cigarette.

30:25.400 --> 30:27.280
Give me a cigarette.
My fetus needs it!

30:27.360 --> 30:31.120
I swear I'll mess Arturo up
before you sit in any court dock.

30:31.200 --> 30:33.280
You won't mess anybody up.
Take it easy.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.360
She's right, they'll put her away!

30:35.720 --> 30:37.960
If we escape and get caught,
she's going to jail.

30:38.080 --> 30:40.200
If we stay and the cops get in,
it's the same.

30:40.360 --> 30:42.640
One way or another she'll do time.

30:46.800 --> 30:47.720
Shit.

30:51.320 --> 30:52.800
I always make the wrong choice.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.440
I always make the wrong choice.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.720
I messed around with a married man.

31:03.640 --> 31:04.800
I got pregnant.

31:07.200 --> 31:08.600
And then another guy comes in,

31:10.800 --> 31:12.120
shoots me in the leg,

31:13.000 --> 31:13.840
and I go

31:15.480 --> 31:16.480
and fall in love.

31:18.120 --> 31:19.720
You know what we'll do?

31:20.600 --> 31:21.480
What?

31:21.560 --> 31:22.880
You'll come with us.

31:23.200 --> 31:25.440
You crossed the line.

31:25.520 --> 31:27.360
I won't leave you behind. Okay?

31:27.440 --> 31:29.720
-Look, son. Maybe...
-She's coming with us!

31:30.000 --> 31:32.560
She'll take Tokyo or Oslo's place,
end of story!

31:32.640 --> 31:33.560
No, listen.

31:34.080 --> 31:35.560
I'm just the secretary.

31:37.320 --> 31:40.880
I don't see myself running away
from the police or shooting guns.

31:41.040 --> 31:43.720
Or hiding in who knows where, Cambodia.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.640
A country without extradition laws.
I don't.

31:48.160 --> 31:49.280
It's better to stay.

31:51.520 --> 31:53.520
And when the police come, I'll say

31:55.320 --> 31:56.680
I did it because I had

31:57.240 --> 31:59.240
big-time Stockholm syndrome and

31:59.640 --> 32:01.160
that will be an extenuating.

32:02.600 --> 32:03.920
That's what it was, right?

32:11.400 --> 32:12.640
Stockholm.

32:14.800 --> 32:15.680
What?

32:16.920 --> 32:18.080
That sounds nice.

32:19.200 --> 32:21.160
If you come with us, you...

32:21.840 --> 32:23.880
your name could be Stockholm.

32:26.400 --> 32:27.520
I don't know, man!

32:55.800 --> 32:56.680
Get out.

33:17.200 --> 33:18.720
DO NOT CROSS
POLICE LINE

33:23.800 --> 33:24.720
Open it.

33:30.600 --> 33:31.480
Get in.

33:47.160 --> 33:48.840
We were all exhausted.

33:51.200 --> 33:52.360
The lack of sleep,

33:55.000 --> 33:55.840
the stress,

33:57.800 --> 34:00.400
or the anguish of years
keeping a secret that,

34:00.480 --> 34:02.040
in that suffocating environment,

34:02.360 --> 34:03.920
was becoming harder to keep.

34:06.400 --> 34:07.280
And all of us,

34:07.880 --> 34:08.840
sooner or later,

34:09.440 --> 34:10.560
lost control.

34:11.480 --> 34:12.400
Except for Berlin.

34:13.320 --> 34:16.840
He was the only one who stuck
to the resting protocol.

34:18.240 --> 34:19.160
The others

34:21.240 --> 34:22.240
went crazy.

34:24.160 --> 34:26.280
I have tried being nice.

34:32.720 --> 34:35.320
I tried to give you
what you were promised.

34:36.120 --> 34:37.840
To free you from Berlin.

34:39.400 --> 34:42.000
For this to make sense!

34:43.160 --> 34:47.120
After losing what I have lost,
to give this some meaning.

34:49.320 --> 34:50.200
I'm kind.

34:52.160 --> 34:53.120
I've been kind.

34:55.480 --> 34:56.480
And the world

34:57.400 --> 34:58.560
spits in my face.

35:03.640 --> 35:04.600
I have tried

35:05.440 --> 35:06.640
to give you space.

35:08.520 --> 35:11.160
And you fucked me over.

35:14.720 --> 35:15.560
Berlin.

35:17.200 --> 35:18.040
Berlin.

35:19.440 --> 35:20.320
Hey.

35:20.800 --> 35:22.480
It's been over an hour and a half.

35:27.240 --> 35:28.360
Don't you feel like

35:29.600 --> 35:30.520
killing me

35:31.200 --> 35:32.120
while I sleep?

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
Just a little.

35:38.480 --> 35:39.400
Hey.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.040
You're laughing.

35:44.680 --> 35:46.800
That means you're
not afraid of me anymore.

35:50.760 --> 35:54.360
Let's say the dose of tranquilizers
I'm taking has neutralized me.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.240
If everything works out,

36:04.120 --> 36:05.080
which is

36:05.760 --> 36:08.720
unlikely if I don't take the reins again,
but...

36:11.000 --> 36:12.160
if it does all work out,

36:13.280 --> 36:14.920
I'd like to propose a deal,

36:15.640 --> 36:17.080
a romantic venture.

36:20.600 --> 36:23.560
Within a few days
I'll send you a plane ticket

36:26.000 --> 36:26.880
to a very

36:27.640 --> 36:28.720
distant place.

36:30.480 --> 36:31.360
If you want,

36:34.400 --> 36:35.640
you can come with me.

36:36.600 --> 36:37.960
For a very short time,

36:40.600 --> 36:41.720
a lot of pleasure.

36:45.520 --> 36:46.560
And then,

36:48.560 --> 36:49.680
after it ends,

36:52.800 --> 36:54.880
you get to keep everything I have.

36:59.560 --> 37:01.720
It would be really wonderful

37:02.640 --> 37:04.480
if you fell completely in love with me.

37:08.400 --> 37:09.400
But...

37:11.000 --> 37:12.640
I don't live on expectations

37:13.320 --> 37:14.560
or false hopes.

37:16.960 --> 37:18.240
I have many flaws,

37:19.360 --> 37:20.520
and I know it.

37:22.720 --> 37:24.560
I could settle for

37:24.880 --> 37:25.800
you being

37:26.400 --> 37:27.240
my partner

37:28.000 --> 37:29.240
until the final voyage.

37:33.120 --> 37:34.160
You and me together

37:35.520 --> 37:36.680
until the end.

38:21.560 --> 38:22.640
You don't get it.

38:23.520 --> 38:24.600
You don't get it.

38:28.160 --> 38:32.080
What do I have to do to get some respect?

38:33.080 --> 38:34.400
What do I have to do?

38:35.040 --> 38:36.880
Do I cut off one of your ears

38:37.400 --> 38:38.960
and send it to your father?

38:40.160 --> 38:43.560
Or shoot you in the leg
so you can't ever dance again?

38:43.720 --> 38:45.080
That's a great idea!

38:48.560 --> 38:50.200
It is time to be pragmatic.

38:53.560 --> 38:55.000
The utopia

38:55.120 --> 38:56.480
of collaboration

38:57.520 --> 38:58.440
has failed.

39:00.480 --> 39:01.360
Nairobi,

39:06.320 --> 39:10.280
I appreciate you allowing me
to take some time off from my duties,

39:12.000 --> 39:12.840
but...

39:13.320 --> 39:16.400
we're all ready for me
to be back in charge.

39:18.640 --> 39:19.480
All yours.

39:26.640 --> 39:29.000
This is a wonderful moment.

39:37.400 --> 39:38.360
Stand up!

39:49.480 --> 39:50.600
I told you

39:51.640 --> 39:52.880
I was going to protect you,

39:53.400 --> 39:54.280
didn't I?

39:56.120 --> 39:57.840
But I've changed my mind.

40:01.280 --> 40:02.960
It's a lot more practical

40:04.720 --> 40:05.840
to torture you.

40:11.440 --> 40:13.320
In concentration camps,

40:14.840 --> 40:16.920
respect is a given.

40:18.240 --> 40:20.200
Well, here it's going to be the same.

40:21.480 --> 40:23.720
You're going to dig the tunnel

40:25.600 --> 40:27.640
until your hands bleed!

40:29.880 --> 40:30.760
At night,

40:31.520 --> 40:33.280
you may cry in pain

40:33.640 --> 40:34.920
in your cot,

40:35.200 --> 40:38.240
but you will keep on digging!

40:43.800 --> 40:46.440
You'll be on shifts without rest.

40:47.800 --> 40:50.320
Otherwise, an epic punishment awaits you.

40:52.840 --> 40:54.160
Just like your leader.

41:03.760 --> 41:06.800
A man who will kill
if he betrays us again.

41:09.160 --> 41:12.360
Who will kill if he ever
yearns for freedom again.

41:15.200 --> 41:16.360
Whose sweat

41:18.880 --> 41:19.880
kills.

41:20.760 --> 41:22.880
A man of explosive nature.

41:28.120 --> 41:31.120
Now they're going to be scared of you,
Arturo.

41:31.200 --> 41:34.520
Although we've always known
you're "the bomb".

41:38.400 --> 41:41.400
Since you're an outcast,
you'll stay here, secluded.

41:41.480 --> 41:44.240
Helsinki and everyone else, to the tunnel!

41:45.240 --> 41:46.800
Come on, let's go!

41:47.840 --> 41:49.120
Let's go, quickly!

42:31.520 --> 42:33.720
