WEBVTT

00:54.864 --> 00:56.999
I know. It's really,
really stupid.

00:58.667 --> 01:01.904
The rules say, oh, you can't
have bra straps showing.

01:02.604 --> 01:05.574
I think it's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

01:08.077 --> 01:09.011
Right?

01:10.412 --> 01:12.747
Like, no bra straps?
What's with that?

01:12.749 --> 01:15.718
Yes, thank you! I know.

01:16.753 --> 01:17.918
- You don't look ready to go.
- Stop it!

01:17.920 --> 01:18.921
Two minutes!

01:19.922 --> 01:21.454
Oh, I've got an unbelievably
busy day today.

01:21.456 --> 01:25.092
I'm meeting Roxy for coffee at nine,
and then I've got five houses to show.

01:25.094 --> 01:29.832
Everybody wants to sell,
but who can afford to buy at these prices?

01:34.369 --> 01:35.002
Hmm.

01:35.004 --> 01:36.636
- It's yummy.
- Hmm.

01:36.638 --> 01:37.974
I'm trying to unclog your heart.

01:38.573 --> 01:39.541
My heart is not clogged.

01:40.609 --> 01:42.408
You eat like a teenager.

01:42.410 --> 01:43.576
Let's face facts.

01:43.578 --> 01:44.812
Oh, come here.

01:44.814 --> 01:46.548
It's time for you to face facts.

01:47.116 --> 01:47.984
Okay?

01:49.618 --> 01:50.718
Face it.

01:50.720 --> 01:52.287
Louise!

01:52.889 --> 01:54.556
Hmm, you smell great.

01:54.957 --> 01:56.857
It's that perfume you
got me for my birthday.

01:56.859 --> 01:58.060
Oh, yeah? Good for me.

02:01.530 --> 02:02.430
Oh.

02:03.465 --> 02:05.431
All right. Let's go. Backpack.

02:05.433 --> 02:06.801
Okay, I'm getting it.

02:06.803 --> 02:08.702
- Will you take these, please?
- Yeah.

02:08.704 --> 02:09.638
Okay.

02:10.940 --> 02:12.438
Bye.

02:12.440 --> 02:14.010
Hey, Louise, laces.

02:34.462 --> 02:35.597
Goodbye to you.

02:37.700 --> 02:38.935
Yuck.

02:50.012 --> 02:50.980
Hello.

02:51.981 --> 02:52.915
Amigo!

02:54.516 --> 02:57.952
Rob's Cafe, yes, yes.
You read my mind.

02:57.954 --> 02:59.621
Could you give me
like a half an hour?

03:00.622 --> 03:03.858
Yeah, order me, I don't
know, the No. 2 special,

03:03.860 --> 03:06.026
over-easy bacon on the side,
and you know what?

03:06.028 --> 03:09.697
While you're at it, why don't you throw in
a neat little stack of buttermilk pancakes?

03:09.699 --> 03:10.831
How about that?

03:41.197 --> 03:42.229
Oh, hey.

03:42.231 --> 03:43.529
Hi.

03:43.531 --> 03:45.567
Oh, hey.

03:45.935 --> 03:48.202
- You look amazing.
- Thanks.

03:48.204 --> 03:49.638
Did you do something
to your hair?

03:50.039 --> 03:51.105
I washed it.

03:51.107 --> 03:52.505
Hmm, looks really good.

03:52.507 --> 03:54.143
- Thank you.
- So,

03:55.044 --> 03:55.945
can you tell?

03:59.648 --> 04:01.581
I'm pregnant.

04:01.583 --> 04:03.119
Oh, my God!

04:04.921 --> 04:09.890
I couldn't say anything until I was at least 12
weeks along but I finally heard the heartbeat.

04:09.892 --> 04:12.159
Oh, my God! That's so exciting.

04:12.161 --> 04:14.663
Actually, I should
say heartbeats.

04:15.131 --> 04:16.764
Twins?

04:16.766 --> 04:17.698
Triplets.

04:18.768 --> 04:21.268
I know! I know! I know! I
know! Oh, my God! Okay.

04:21.270 --> 04:24.238
I mean, I knew... I knew this was a
possibility because of the fertility drugs,

04:24.240 --> 04:26.943
but Nicky is shitting bricks.

04:27.575 --> 04:29.076
Therapist has to work
to calm him down.

04:29.078 --> 04:30.911
Oh, I didn't know
you saw a therapist.

04:30.913 --> 04:33.047
Ah, triplets,
I can't believe it.

04:33.049 --> 04:34.782
I'm gonna have a
house full of kids.

04:34.784 --> 04:37.084
I only going to have to
wreck my body one time.

04:37.086 --> 04:38.953
I mean, I'm just...
I'm over the moon.

04:38.955 --> 04:40.254
I've already hired
a nursery designer.

04:40.256 --> 04:41.188
Is it helping?

04:41.190 --> 04:42.723
Oh, God, I'm buying
everything in sight.

04:42.725 --> 04:44.091
No, I mean, the therapist.

04:44.093 --> 04:46.260
Why? You guys don't go?

04:46.262 --> 04:49.964
No, but I think maybe we should.

04:49.966 --> 04:50.931
Problems?

04:50.933 --> 04:53.267
It's mostly just money stuff.

04:53.269 --> 04:54.835
That's why I think I
need to get a new job.

04:54.837 --> 04:57.037
No, no, honey, you are married.

04:57.039 --> 04:59.073
It is the man's job
to make the money.

04:59.075 --> 05:00.007
Yeah, Bob doesn't care.

05:00.009 --> 05:02.745
He's fine with things
the way they are.

05:03.212 --> 05:06.481
He better care if he wants
to stay married to you.

05:16.993 --> 05:19.559
All right. Just play it half
speed from right here.

05:19.561 --> 05:22.830
That's good. All right. So, now,
let's keep... it's after this, time right,

05:22.832 --> 05:24.597
okay, stop, pause,
see? Right there.

05:24.599 --> 05:29.703
Do you see it? Run it back frame by frame,
frame by frame, slowly, a little bit further,

05:29.705 --> 05:32.973
and right there.
Look, they're dancing.

05:32.975 --> 05:34.308
See it? Polar bears dancing.

05:34.310 --> 05:37.211
Yeah. Ha? That's our cover.

05:37.213 --> 05:39.046
That's our cover. Print
that image. That's great.

05:39.048 --> 05:41.183
You must be
so happy. That's great.

05:41.851 --> 05:44.051
But... but back...
back to the house.

05:44.053 --> 05:47.021
So, Larry, I mean, I think it
checks all the boxes, right?

05:47.023 --> 05:49.857
It... it, you know, it's got
the-the pool, the Jacuzzi,

05:49.859 --> 05:52.228
yeah, and it's great
for entertaining.

05:52.928 --> 05:54.263
Oh, can you hold on one second?

05:55.597 --> 05:57.833
Larry, I need one second.
I'll be right back.

05:58.968 --> 05:59.869
Hi.

06:00.635 --> 06:01.835
Yeah.

06:01.837 --> 06:05.007
No, no, I'm... I'm... I'm waiting
right here for you. Yeah.

06:07.143 --> 06:11.247
Uh, no, I can't come
back at seven tonight.

06:14.350 --> 06:18.687
No, no, no, no, it's fine. These things
happen. We... we'll reschedule it.

06:19.088 --> 06:21.123
You have a great audition, okay?

06:21.991 --> 06:23.625
Good luck! Bye.

06:26.228 --> 06:28.896
Larry, it's me, I'm back.
Thanks for holding. Okay.

06:28.898 --> 06:32.600
I think that if you want the house,
you're gonna have to make an offer.

06:34.703 --> 06:35.704
Hello, Larry?

06:45.247 --> 06:45.915
Ugh!

06:47.783 --> 06:49.952
- I hate real estate.
- Uh-oh.

06:54.190 --> 06:56.390
- What the heck!
- It will get better.

06:56.392 --> 06:58.692
I don't know, maybe
it's just a midlife thing.

06:58.694 --> 07:00.863
Life is just...

07:02.331 --> 07:03.665
Maybe you should get a new job.

07:04.834 --> 07:06.467
I like my job.

07:06.469 --> 07:10.206
Of course you do, and that's what I love
about you. You're so easily pleased.

07:11.273 --> 07:14.775
I want a break
from all the drudgery.

07:14.777 --> 07:19.046
I mean, I want
my life to expand.

07:19.048 --> 07:20.314
Yes, I know... I know
what you mean.

07:20.316 --> 07:22.282
- You do?
- Yeah, I do. I do.

07:22.284 --> 07:23.684
- You do?
- I do. I do. I do.

07:23.686 --> 07:25.786
That's why I think
that if we had a baby...

07:25.788 --> 07:30.157
I told you I don't
want a goddamn baby.

07:30.159 --> 07:34.797
We must have been insane not to
resolve this before we got married.

07:35.164 --> 07:40.868
Huh! Baby? Yeah, a baby! Who's gonna take care
of the baby and all the stuff for the baby

07:40.870 --> 07:42.037
and everything like that?

07:44.140 --> 07:48.709
Guess what? Roxy's
pregnant with triplets.

07:48.711 --> 07:52.946
In your wildest dreams you cannot imagine
the torture the triplets would be,

07:52.948 --> 07:55.217
and our marriage
would snap like a twig.

07:55.851 --> 07:59.219
She and Nick are in some kind of therapy
like marriage counseling or something.

07:59.221 --> 08:00.721
Oh, Jesus.

08:00.723 --> 08:02.091
I think we should try it.

08:03.359 --> 08:05.325
It doesn't mean that there's
something wrong with us.

08:05.327 --> 08:08.328
It just means that we want to
understand each other better.

08:08.330 --> 08:10.733
It... it's totally normal.

08:11.167 --> 08:14.301
It may be totally normal,
but why do we need it?

08:14.303 --> 08:17.237
Because we do,
because it's a good idea.

08:17.239 --> 08:22.910
We're fine the way we are,
and you talk about money issues, right?

08:22.912 --> 08:28.248
We're just... we're gonna pay to... to
invite a complete stranger into our lives?

08:28.250 --> 08:34.790
Well, we could, for example,
get a little help with the baby question.

08:36.225 --> 08:38.727
I mean, couldn't
we at least try it?

08:39.828 --> 08:42.331
It could change
our lives, right?

08:44.333 --> 08:48.037
I'm against it, but... but

08:48.971 --> 08:53.106
if it'll make you happy, I'll
try it once to make you happy.

08:53.108 --> 08:54.508
You are such a wonderful man.

08:54.510 --> 08:55.878
Oh.

08:57.513 --> 08:58.714
Hmm.

08:59.848 --> 09:02.349
If we hurry, we got some time
before Louise gets home.

09:02.351 --> 09:03.984
I don't need much time.

09:05.554 --> 09:07.054
Mom!

09:07.056 --> 09:08.422
What?

09:08.424 --> 09:10.290
I need more time than that.

09:36.051 --> 09:37.186
Hi.

09:37.553 --> 09:40.187
How are you?
Traffic was stupid.

09:40.189 --> 09:41.255
It was.

09:41.257 --> 09:43.557
Yeah, yeah, terrible.

09:47.296 --> 09:48.197
Welcome.

09:49.398 --> 09:51.300
I'm Judy Small.
Please come in.

10:00.342 --> 10:05.114
So the best way to begin is for you to
tell me a little bit about why you're here.

10:09.518 --> 10:10.352
Um,

10:11.487 --> 10:12.988
I guess

10:15.557 --> 10:19.928
I just really want
our marriage to be

10:20.929 --> 10:22.431
the real thing.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.566
You think it isn't
the real thing?

10:26.568 --> 10:29.403
No, I... I didn't... no,
I didn't mean that.

10:29.405 --> 10:31.905
I... I just... um...

10:31.907 --> 10:37.212
For whatever reason I think
I just... I don't feel satisfied.

10:38.314 --> 10:39.548
Why do you think that is?

10:41.417 --> 10:42.451
I don't know.

10:44.887 --> 10:48.924
I met my first husband
when I was in college.

10:50.125 --> 10:54.528
We fell in love,
and we got married,

10:54.530 --> 11:00.235
and we had Louise,
and one day I woke up to a ringing phone

11:01.070 --> 11:02.371
and he was dead.

11:04.206 --> 11:08.310
He was out fishing at
night with his friends and

11:10.512 --> 11:13.349
he fell overboard and
was killed by the propeller.

11:16.452 --> 11:17.486
I am sorry.

11:18.620 --> 11:22.690
For five years I took
care of Louise all by myself.

11:22.692 --> 11:24.692
I made all the money.

11:24.694 --> 11:28.564
I paid all the bills, and
I took the garbage out,

11:29.565 --> 11:31.867
and I guess I just-

11:33.469 --> 11:36.136
I kind of want to
be taken care of.

11:36.138 --> 11:40.275
- And you feel that Bob doesn't take care of you?
- No, I... I mean, yes.

11:41.577 --> 11:42.945
I love Bob.

11:43.312 --> 11:44.279
I just-

11:45.147 --> 11:47.447
I think maybe I want
more than he does.

11:47.449 --> 11:49.983
He... he doesn't seem to
care about money at all.

11:49.985 --> 11:51.251
No, I care.

11:51.253 --> 11:53.989
I care. It's just that money has
never been that important to me.

11:56.125 --> 12:00.295
I just want to be happier I
guess, you know, I want... if

12:01.230 --> 12:07.136
true happiness exists, and I think it does,
I mean, I definitely tasted it with Bob.

12:07.737 --> 12:12.641
If happiness is out
there, I just really want it.

12:14.276 --> 12:15.177
I see.

12:19.381 --> 12:21.250
Why are you here today, Bob?

12:24.119 --> 12:24.953
Well,

12:25.889 --> 12:28.123
yeah, Susan pretty
much dragged me here.

12:35.063 --> 12:38.733
Tell me, what is it
you do professionally?

12:38.735 --> 12:42.068
Oh, um, I'm the Head of
Programming at The Nature Channel.

12:42.070 --> 12:43.203
I love that channel.

12:43.205 --> 12:44.137
You do?

12:44.139 --> 12:48.375
Yes, I find animals
just so fascinating.

12:48.377 --> 12:50.343
Oh, well, I just uh...
you're going to love this.

12:50.345 --> 12:52.948
I just finished this special
about polar bears.

12:53.382 --> 12:55.517
Just remarkable animals.

12:56.185 --> 12:57.150
Remarkable.

12:57.152 --> 12:58.786
Well, that's splendid.

12:58.788 --> 13:03.959
I just want our marriage to be the best
it can be, to be as strong as it can be.

13:04.426 --> 13:06.595
Is there something
wrong with that?

13:07.229 --> 13:11.164
Do you have ideas about how I might
be able to help you in this regard?

13:11.166 --> 13:17.239
Well, yes, I mean there are a few
things, maybe one, or two, or three.

13:18.775 --> 13:23.310
First, there's the issue of, you
know, how we both feel about money,

13:23.312 --> 13:24.812
how much we need
to feel secure.

13:24.814 --> 13:26.112
- I think that's a big one.
- Hmm.

13:26.114 --> 13:29.249
And then there's the issue

13:29.251 --> 13:31.386
of whether or not
we have a baby.

13:32.254 --> 13:34.020
Mm-hmm.

13:34.022 --> 13:37.725
And then there's our family dynamic, you know,
Louise, my daughter, she's 13 years old

13:37.727 --> 13:40.761
and she's lovely.

13:40.763 --> 13:43.465
She's a blossoming
young woman, really, and

13:45.768 --> 13:47.737
lately I wonder

13:49.171 --> 13:51.304
if it's getting
complicated for Bob.

13:51.306 --> 13:52.207
What?

13:55.110 --> 13:56.643
What are you even
talking about right now?

13:56.645 --> 13:59.414
The other morning,
in the kitchen,

14:00.649 --> 14:04.019
I saw you looking at her.
She was in her underwear.

14:11.527 --> 14:12.492
Yeah.

14:12.494 --> 14:13.293
Yes.

14:13.295 --> 14:15.262
I see Louise.

14:15.264 --> 14:18.799
I'm not looking at her, not in the
way that you're implying at least.

14:18.801 --> 14:20.469
I can't even believe
you're saying this.

14:24.106 --> 14:29.442
You know what? I think... I think I'm a pretty
damn good stepfather, and a good husband...

14:29.444 --> 14:31.146
- Yes.
- too for that matter.

14:32.147 --> 14:33.315
I love Louise.

14:33.783 --> 14:35.484
I love Susan, but

14:36.618 --> 14:39.087
a comment like that,
that is just damn hurtful.

14:39.689 --> 14:41.089
It's damn hurtful.

14:45.260 --> 14:48.161
Perhaps Louise
should join us next week.

14:48.163 --> 14:49.631
If you think that's
helpful, yeah.

14:50.198 --> 14:51.066
I defer.

15:12.654 --> 15:15.723
So are you and Bob
getting a divorce?

15:15.725 --> 15:18.226
Oh, baby, of course not.

15:18.695 --> 15:20.730
- No.
- Well, then why are you seeing a shrink?

15:21.931 --> 15:25.733
- Never mind. Don't tell me.
- She sees lots of couples.

15:25.735 --> 15:28.401
Don't tell me that.
That's really gross.

15:28.403 --> 15:29.603
- Really, gross?
- Mm-hmm.

15:29.605 --> 15:32.207
- Oh, it's so gross.
- Yeah, it's disgusting.

15:33.342 --> 15:36.578
Listen, you are a very
important part of this family,

15:38.280 --> 15:41.784
and you are my favorite
person in the entire world

15:43.352 --> 15:46.754
so I want you to come
with us next time we see her.

15:46.756 --> 15:47.922
- No way.
- Yes.

15:47.924 --> 15:50.891
- No! No, I... I won't do it.
- You are going to see her.

15:50.893 --> 15:52.592
- No.
- Yes, you are.

15:52.594 --> 15:53.894
- Yes, you are.
- No.

15:53.896 --> 15:54.897
Yes!

16:00.803 --> 16:02.703
- <i>Señor.</i>
- Amigo.

16:02.705 --> 16:04.337
How are those polar
bears coming?

16:04.339 --> 16:06.239
Good, yeah, almost set to go.

16:06.241 --> 16:06.909
Great.

16:07.542 --> 16:09.309
Uh, you got a minute to talk?

16:09.311 --> 16:11.511
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no problem.

16:11.513 --> 16:12.280
What's up?

16:18.054 --> 16:23.492
Clarette got pink-slipped at Disney so she's
freaking out about finding a new job, and

16:24.226 --> 16:26.694
I don't exactly blame her
'cause times are tough.

16:26.696 --> 16:28.929
Yeah, I'm sorry
to hear that, man.

16:28.931 --> 16:34.300
Yeah, so our income just got cut in half, and
now she decides she wants to get married,

16:34.302 --> 16:36.536
and buy a place with a
swimming pool up in the hills.

16:36.538 --> 16:38.505
I thought you and
Clarette were married.

16:38.507 --> 16:41.343
No, just... just keeping house.

16:41.878 --> 16:44.312
Anyway, that's...
that's not why I'm here.

16:47.449 --> 16:50.318
Um, you know, Annabelle
Bernard down in accounting?

16:51.486 --> 16:54.287
Dark hair, great
legs, short skirt.

16:54.289 --> 16:55.890
Yeah, yeah, sure, Annabelle.

16:55.892 --> 16:58.326
We... we started this thing,

16:59.028 --> 17:00.728
you know, nothing serious.

17:00.730 --> 17:05.632
Just a couple of days a week at lunch, and
then yesterday she comes into my office,

17:05.634 --> 17:10.639
closed the door behind her, as soon as that
happens, man, my heart went through the floor

17:11.373 --> 17:16.911
'cause she's in love with me,
wants us to quit our jobs, move to Mexico.

17:16.913 --> 17:18.045
Seriously?

17:18.047 --> 17:18.848
Yeah.

17:20.449 --> 17:22.850
And... and I'll tell you what scares the
shit out of me. It's... it's not Clarette.

17:22.852 --> 17:24.651
I... I can handle Clarette.

17:24.653 --> 17:27.988
It's... with the world turned upside down these
days, all she has to do is point the finger

17:27.990 --> 17:29.355
and my ass is grass.

17:29.357 --> 17:31.859
Sexual harassment?
You think she'd do that?

17:31.861 --> 17:33.928
Nowadays? Come on.

17:33.930 --> 17:35.898
These women will do anything.

17:37.432 --> 17:39.566
Wow! Well, have you
tried talking to her?

17:39.568 --> 17:43.536
Have you ever tried talking to a woman
especially one that's pissed off at you?

17:43.538 --> 17:45.507
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:47.043 --> 17:47.810
Um-

17:52.414 --> 17:55.484
Um, do you want
me to talk to her?

17:56.085 --> 17:57.985
Oh, man, would you?

17:57.987 --> 17:59.689
Yeah, sure.

18:02.024 --> 18:03.556
You're a gentleman
and a scholar.

18:03.558 --> 18:04.557
No, it's my pleasure.

18:04.559 --> 18:05.828
- Thank you.
- For sure.

18:07.529 --> 18:10.998
Hey I'd love to stick around, but I got an
appointment across town I got to get to.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.466
- Job prospect?
- Yeah, no, no, no, no.

18:13.468 --> 18:14.467
Marriage counseling.

18:14.469 --> 18:15.770
- Ooh.
- Yeah.

18:15.772 --> 18:16.906
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

18:27.649 --> 18:28.718
It's okay to laugh.

18:29.118 --> 18:32.987
I just think this whole
thing is weird.

18:32.989 --> 18:37.524
Laughter can be very constructive
sometimes just for the release of it.

18:37.526 --> 18:41.697
I laugh between sessions,
alone, right here in my office.

18:44.934 --> 18:46.533
Oh, bless you.

18:46.535 --> 18:47.302
Thank you.

18:49.739 --> 18:50.639
There.

18:51.439 --> 18:51.941
Bingo!

18:53.475 --> 18:54.010
Hmm,

18:55.410 --> 18:56.545
one sneeze.

18:58.080 --> 19:03.650
If I didn't have my hankie, bacteria,
germs would've spread amongst us all.

19:03.652 --> 19:09.357
Think of your conflicts as germs,
left unchecked, without a hankie,

19:09.959 --> 19:14.128
they spread among you...
the three of you, living unit.

19:14.130 --> 19:17.033
I have never really felt
like a germ before.

19:19.135 --> 19:19.936
Well,

19:20.803 --> 19:24.673
other than mortality
itself, it is the

19:25.074 --> 19:30.046
human bond most essential,
a web that ensnares us all.

19:30.612 --> 19:32.179
Ensnares?

19:32.181 --> 19:38.087
Yes, I'm referring to the thread of
life that wraps us around and binds us.

19:39.621 --> 19:40.688
Hmm.

19:40.690 --> 19:44.992
Um, do I have to be here?
'Cause I have homework.

19:44.994 --> 19:52.802
Louise, this is your chance, in the safety
of this room to say anything you want.

19:56.105 --> 19:59.507
Well, there is something

20:01.978 --> 20:03.645
since I'm here.

20:07.049 --> 20:09.919
Baby, we wanna hear what
you have to say. Go ahead.

20:12.487 --> 20:13.888
I have no freedom.

20:13.890 --> 20:18.025
My mom is scared to let me do
anything ever since my father died.

20:18.027 --> 20:19.693
That is not true.

20:19.695 --> 20:21.862
I'm 13, and I can't even
go on a sleepover.

20:21.864 --> 20:23.663
You've been on a sleepover.

20:23.665 --> 20:28.534
Once, and then you showed up in the middle of
the night in your pajamas with Comfy Cream.

20:28.536 --> 20:30.773
You'd slammed your finger.

20:31.807 --> 20:34.641
It was 'cause the girl having
a sleepover only had a dad.

20:34.643 --> 20:36.110
Oh, not true.

20:36.112 --> 20:37.778
Yes, it is. It is so true.

20:37.780 --> 20:39.947
- No, it's not true!
- Yes, it is.

20:39.949 --> 20:41.549
It's true, right?

20:42.952 --> 20:44.887
You know what? I think your mother
just wants what's best for you.

20:48.925 --> 20:54.997
Louise, just so I understand,
are you saying that your mom,

20:55.597 --> 20:56.799
what, is

20:58.500 --> 20:59.101
afraid of men?

21:01.804 --> 21:04.671
She definitely
doesn't trust them.

21:04.673 --> 21:08.077
I cannot believe that
you're saying this.

21:15.184 --> 21:19.121
Can I go? Can I,
please, be done, Mom?

21:19.922 --> 21:21.188
Fine by me.

21:21.190 --> 21:22.725
Bye, sweetie.

21:24.927 --> 21:26.528
- Bye-bye.
- Mm-hmm.

21:33.302 --> 21:39.641
You... you do understand that you have to take
everything Louise says with a big grain of salt.

21:40.276 --> 21:42.943
I'm really pleased that I got
the chance to meet her.

21:42.945 --> 21:46.716
You know what? I should say right
now that Susan is a wonderful mother.

21:47.917 --> 21:49.183
Thank you.

21:49.185 --> 21:50.652
I needed that.

21:51.053 --> 21:51.988
Okay. Well,

21:53.723 --> 22:00.863
I've had this chance to see you as a family
unit, and there are some certain tensions.

22:02.664 --> 22:07.269
What would you think about the idea of
me spending time alone with each of you?

22:08.237 --> 22:11.038
I think that sounds
like a great idea.

22:11.040 --> 22:12.041
Hmm.

22:16.278 --> 22:23.150
There's this new couple, the
Howards, typical LA couple.

22:23.152 --> 22:28.088
Their problems are
very ordinary as is she,

22:28.090 --> 22:31.293
but there's something
about the husband,

22:33.896 --> 22:35.896
something elusive.

22:35.898 --> 22:36.964
It's a quality.

22:36.966 --> 22:39.702
It's very difficult to define.

23:20.776 --> 23:25.879
I've just learned that
Judith Smolinsky James is in Los Angeles.

23:25.881 --> 23:31.118
Apparently, she's resumed her practice
there under the name of Judy Small.

23:31.120 --> 23:34.654
What did he say? Judy who?

23:34.656 --> 23:36.023
It was inevitable.

23:36.025 --> 23:37.524
Someone please fill me in.

23:37.526 --> 23:41.695
She was removed from our roster two
years ago for unprofessional conduct.

23:41.697 --> 23:45.999
It was an unfortunate incident of
counter transference enactment.

23:46.001 --> 23:47.034
Why do I not know this?

23:47.036 --> 23:48.302
You must have blocked it?

23:48.304 --> 23:49.338
Whose case?

23:51.373 --> 23:52.873
Yes, she was mine.

23:52.875 --> 23:59.046
A severely narcissistic woman,
unanalyzable, entirely without boundaries,

23:59.048 --> 24:02.015
but with an intact capacity
for reality assessment.

24:02.017 --> 24:04.451
For 15 years she had
a spotless record.

24:04.453 --> 24:07.855
I mean, essentially this woman
was raised by wolves.

24:07.857 --> 24:09.756
It was a classic case
of soul murder.

24:09.758 --> 24:15.229
So what are we supposed to do?
Howl at the moon? Dangle red meat?

24:15.231 --> 24:17.431
I... I think she still has a
contribution to make.

24:17.433 --> 24:19.768
Except for the patient in
Boston who killed himself.

24:20.436 --> 24:24.071
Her method was unorthodox
to say the least.

24:24.073 --> 24:26.240
Look, I'm not saying that
mistakes weren't made.

24:26.242 --> 24:28.377
Mistakes that I
am trying to rectify,

24:28.944 --> 24:32.479
but I will tell you all that unofficially
I have been trying to find her.

24:32.481 --> 24:34.314
She's drawing you into
a boundary violation.

24:34.316 --> 24:41.290
Well, I'm certainly being drawn into a role change,
but I'm the only authority figure she's got.

24:42.725 --> 24:43.792
Okay.

24:44.326 --> 24:46.059
Dress code.

24:46.061 --> 24:47.096
Stress code.

24:48.697 --> 24:53.267
...appearing in torn-tattered,
dirty clothing, skin-tight short shorts,

24:53.269 --> 24:57.873
beach clothing or other garments
inappropriate for blah, blah, blah.

24:58.874 --> 24:59.942
Try this on.

25:00.976 --> 25:01.911
Good.

25:02.912 --> 25:05.746
Aren't these perfect? Noisy.

25:05.748 --> 25:07.381
- Perfect.
- Yeah.

25:07.383 --> 25:11.418
I know. I'm wearing the blue
tights that I cut up the other day.

25:11.420 --> 25:16.825
Mm-hmm. And the shirt that
I cut up with the red top under.

25:21.030 --> 25:22.296
We're leaving.

25:22.298 --> 25:23.365
One second.

25:28.204 --> 25:30.270
- Bye, baby, have a good day.
- Bye.

25:30.272 --> 25:31.874
- Thanks, Mom.
- Hmm.

25:32.241 --> 25:34.376
- Love you.
- I love you, too.

25:48.357 --> 25:50.257
We should do this every day.

25:50.259 --> 25:51.227
Ditto.

25:56.098 --> 25:57.066
You two.

25:59.501 --> 26:01.804
Yes, you two.

26:02.338 --> 26:05.307
Ladies, I know you were at
the assembly last week, right?

26:06.075 --> 26:07.007
Yeah, sure.

26:07.009 --> 26:08.842
And you're aware of
the new dress code?

26:08.844 --> 26:09.745
Sort of.

26:10.446 --> 26:12.212
No torn clothing.

26:12.214 --> 26:13.847
These clothes aren't torn.

26:13.849 --> 26:15.115
We cut them ourselves.

26:15.117 --> 26:16.550
To my office.

26:16.552 --> 26:18.187
Discuss this further.

26:20.389 --> 26:21.223
James,

26:22.324 --> 26:24.558
how's this finger?
Come with me too.

26:24.560 --> 26:26.059
And the rest of you, homeroom.

26:26.061 --> 26:27.062
Come on.

26:29.331 --> 26:32.065
You've got no idea how much
dough this place takes in.

26:32.067 --> 26:34.234
Our work is lining
other guys' pockets.

26:34.236 --> 26:36.336
They're raking in
it upstairs on our backs.

26:36.338 --> 26:37.471
I got all the numbers.

26:37.473 --> 26:38.939
I know how much
you make every year.

26:38.941 --> 26:40.042
125, right?

26:41.243 --> 26:43.477
Well, yeah, you know, I'm
gonna ask Beaver for a raise.

26:43.479 --> 26:45.012
They all gonna be rat shit.

26:45.014 --> 26:48.615
- Beaver pulls in 10 times that much, and that's before bonuses.
- Ten times?

26:48.617 --> 26:50.450
Look, we
start our own outfit.

26:50.452 --> 26:52.252
We don't have to limit
ourselves to that nature crap.

26:52.254 --> 26:53.520
We can do whatever we want.

26:53.522 --> 26:54.621
Well, I like the nature crap.

26:54.623 --> 26:57.457
All the big media companies
need content right now.

26:57.459 --> 26:59.393
It's the same
drumbeat every day.

26:59.395 --> 27:00.927
Content is king.

27:00.929 --> 27:04.398
Parents are looking for a place to park
their kids and we can provide that.

27:04.400 --> 27:06.900
Who's our partner?
Motherfucking nature.

27:06.902 --> 27:08.235
Walter's got all the contacts.

27:08.237 --> 27:09.704
He can sell ice to
fucking Eskimos.

27:09.706 --> 27:13.006
We get to keep doing exactly what
we're doing right now except this time

27:13.008 --> 27:14.443
we're lining
our own pockets.

27:15.110 --> 27:16.209
Okay.

27:16.211 --> 27:18.078
Okay. So why do
you guys need me?

27:18.080 --> 27:20.249
We're great at making deals.
You're great at making product.

27:21.483 --> 27:24.918
Conservatively, we're gonna quadruple
our take home in the first year,

27:24.920 --> 27:27.456
but remember, Beaver gets one
whiff of this and we're fucked.

27:29.425 --> 27:32.125
Did you have sex
after our last session?

27:32.127 --> 27:33.293
Bob and I?

27:33.295 --> 27:34.430
Yes.

27:37.499 --> 27:38.832
You mean right after?

27:38.834 --> 27:44.406
Susan, we're trying to understand
how you are, just you and Bob

27:45.441 --> 27:49.878
together, your
sexual dialogue.

27:50.279 --> 27:55.918
So you're here to satisfy Susan,
is that the pattern? Her needs dictate?

27:57.619 --> 28:01.288
I don't know.
Yeah, yeah, probably.

28:01.290 --> 28:06.195
I don't have a single couple in my practice
that doesn't have some conflict in this area.

28:06.628 --> 28:10.364
Um, I'm confused because
that's not really our problem.

28:10.366 --> 28:15.535
She knew what I did when she married
me, and what can I do about that?

28:15.537 --> 28:17.337
- Of course she did.
- Yeah.

28:17.339 --> 28:20.876
And you're a man and you
have needs of your own.

28:21.477 --> 28:26.246
Yeah, well, I'm not sure Susan's
too concerned about that.

28:26.248 --> 28:35.255
Sex is one way that we stave off a fear of loss
which feels particularly resonant for you.

28:35.257 --> 28:37.224
You've already
lost one husband.

28:37.226 --> 28:39.061
You don't want to lose another.

28:40.028 --> 28:41.029
Oh, God.

28:42.164 --> 28:46.366
I don't think that I'm afraid
of losing Bob, do you?

28:46.368 --> 28:47.702
Have you been faithful to him?

28:47.704 --> 28:50.470
To Bob? Yes. Absolutely.

28:50.472 --> 28:53.375
And what do we know
about his sexual history?

28:54.109 --> 28:59.579
I mean, he was 39 when we married so
he must have known a lot of women.

28:59.581 --> 29:01.450
He does seem to
appreciate women.

29:02.418 --> 29:04.052
You could tell that so quickly?

29:04.553 --> 29:06.987
Well, we can run,
but we can't hide.

29:06.989 --> 29:11.960
It's not uncommon for women, especially
women who tend to be controlling, to become

29:12.461 --> 29:15.228
competitive with their
adolescent daughters.

29:15.230 --> 29:16.563
No shit.

29:16.565 --> 29:18.200
Has he been faithful to you?

29:25.742 --> 29:27.576
I'm sorry. What
was the question?

29:28.477 --> 29:30.979
So could the tension be
from something else?

29:33.716 --> 29:34.550
Like what?

29:35.150 --> 29:36.618
Your sexual history.

29:40.022 --> 29:42.991
Why? Why did... did
Susan say something or-

29:47.062 --> 29:48.530
Did Susan say something?

29:49.565 --> 29:53.467
Sheila, right? It happened
before we were married.

29:53.469 --> 29:55.604
That's so unbelievable.

29:56.205 --> 29:57.637
Okay.

29:57.639 --> 30:02.144
So I had this one-night thing with
an ex-girlfriend named Sheila.

30:02.745 --> 30:06.179
I confessed to Susan because it made
me realize that I was in love with her.

30:06.181 --> 30:08.050
I proposed to her that night.

30:08.818 --> 30:11.184
I can't believe
she's still angry.

30:11.186 --> 30:13.153
I cannot believe it.

30:13.155 --> 30:14.623
Trust is like a muscle.

30:15.290 --> 30:19.261
Once it's torn,
it's difficult to repair.

30:28.637 --> 30:31.507
Better watch out. Mom
is in a pretty shitty mood.

30:32.441 --> 30:33.743
Thank you for the warning.

30:54.196 --> 30:55.629
How's your day?

30:55.631 --> 30:57.732
Fine. Louise!

30:57.734 --> 30:59.401
I just saw her leave.

31:00.369 --> 31:03.438
What? I... I just sent
her to her room.

31:04.339 --> 31:08.043
Honey, maybe just this one
time you should let it go.

31:09.611 --> 31:11.346
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

31:11.781 --> 31:15.649
It's gonna be dark really soon,
and she's out there all alone.

31:15.651 --> 31:18.753
I don't think that's
really safe, do you?

31:18.755 --> 31:21.388
- Ha.
- Considering the fact that there's been three robberies

31:21.390 --> 31:24.190
in this neighborhood
in the last six months,

31:24.192 --> 31:28.530
to say nothing of the fact
that I sent her to her room.

31:31.734 --> 31:34.301
Sounds like you guys had
a pretty tough afternoon.

31:34.303 --> 31:35.604
Oh!

31:37.406 --> 31:39.074
What the fuck?

31:45.547 --> 31:47.647
Hey, you know what?
I think we need a vacation.

31:47.649 --> 31:50.918
Oh, yeah? That sounds
great. With what money?

31:50.920 --> 31:56.289
Don't you worry about money, okay? Our money
situation is about to change for the better.

31:56.291 --> 31:57.892
How? What happened?

31:57.894 --> 32:03.630
Let's rent a convertible, drive up the
coast, stop whenever we feel like it,

32:03.632 --> 32:07.802
rent motels by the
hour, no-tell motels.

32:07.804 --> 32:11.304
- Hmm, that does sound good, doesn't it?
- Mm-hmm.

32:11.306 --> 32:13.206
Did Beaver give you a raise?

32:13.208 --> 32:14.942
And Louise can
stay with friends.

32:14.944 --> 32:17.878
Hell, she's probably old enough
to stay here by herself.

32:17.880 --> 32:20.447
I am, definitely.

32:20.449 --> 32:24.653
The next time I tell you to go to
your room I expect you to stay there.

32:25.722 --> 32:28.323
Will you tell her that I'm getting
too old for the room stuff?

32:28.925 --> 32:30.392
Tell her yourself.

32:32.127 --> 32:35.832
I'm getting too old for the room stuff unless
you need permission from your therapist.

32:36.665 --> 32:38.231
Oh.

32:38.233 --> 32:44.772
I am trying very hard to deal with a
lot of confusing and difficult things

32:44.774 --> 32:47.908
which is why I
sought out Judy Small

32:47.910 --> 32:51.411
so I would appreciate it if you could
give me a little bit more respect.

32:51.413 --> 32:53.313
Well, Judy Small is a loser.

32:53.315 --> 32:55.785
I didn't ask you
for your opinion,

32:57.319 --> 33:00.688
but because I care about your
thoughts, um, go ahead, tell me.

33:00.690 --> 33:02.622
What do you think?

33:02.624 --> 33:04.792
I don't trust people
who wear scarves.

33:04.794 --> 33:05.860
I wear a scarf.

33:05.862 --> 33:08.929
- No, you don't.
- Hey, hey, come on.

33:08.931 --> 33:12.565
Let's... let's just all cut
each other a little slack, huh?

33:12.567 --> 33:13.736
Thank you. Exactly.

33:17.439 --> 33:19.940
I need to watch somebody
turn... someone has to turn...

33:19.942 --> 33:23.610
I know but it's... it feels
like... it feels like years.

33:23.612 --> 33:27.882
Oh, how are my babies?

33:27.884 --> 33:30.851
I will see you
fine ladies later.

33:30.853 --> 33:31.888
Bye, Nick.

33:35.490 --> 33:38.591
Do you and Nick ever talk about what happens
at Judy Small's, like, outside of the office?

33:38.593 --> 33:40.895
No. Nick and I don't talk at
all. That's why we're going.

33:40.897 --> 33:45.365
She has me and Bob going separately,
and I... we don't even talk about it.

33:45.367 --> 33:46.801
I don't know if I
like it or hate it.

33:46.803 --> 33:49.704
I love being pregnant.

33:49.706 --> 33:51.939
I mean, look at me,
I'm glowing.

33:51.941 --> 33:55.542
There was this guy getting a cappuccino yesterday
who said he had to put on his sunglasses

33:55.544 --> 33:56.378
'cause I was so dazzling.

33:57.814 --> 34:00.613
Hey, you don't get to be
depressed while I'm pregnant.

34:00.615 --> 34:02.482
I'm not depressed.

34:02.484 --> 34:05.853
I'm just a little discouraged.

34:05.855 --> 34:07.822
Susan, you are not pulling
another one of your no-shows.

34:07.824 --> 34:09.389
You are coming to
Nick's launch party.

34:09.391 --> 34:11.458
Stern is gonna be there.
I need you to meet her.

34:11.460 --> 34:12.760
There are gonna be a lot
of big people at this thing.

34:12.762 --> 34:14.028
I thought Nick was a writer.

34:14.030 --> 34:17.530
Writing is not big money. This
thing with Stern is big money.

34:17.532 --> 34:21.367
Now, I have until four o'clock today to
decide on the stencils for the baby's rooms.

34:21.369 --> 34:24.038
I have it narrowed
down to koala bears,

34:24.040 --> 34:26.606
and sailboats, and then these
adorable little Raphael angels.

34:26.608 --> 34:27.609
So do you want to help me?

34:28.010 --> 34:29.244
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

34:31.748 --> 34:33.246
Hi, Juanita.

34:33.248 --> 34:36.418
Can we have the stencils on the
counter in the kitchen, <i>por favor?</i>

34:37.552 --> 34:38.688
So cute. Oh.

34:40.223 --> 34:42.957
Also, can we have a pitcher of iced tea?
Pretty, pretty, <i>por favor.</i>

34:42.959 --> 34:44.259
Thank you.

34:46.062 --> 34:48.030
Twenty-three more minutes?

34:48.698 --> 34:50.032
Oh, my gosh.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.834
I can't believe we
just have to sit here.

34:53.836 --> 34:55.836
Detention so sucks.

34:55.838 --> 34:57.305
I hate this school.

34:57.907 --> 34:59.407
It sucks.

34:59.809 --> 35:01.476
We're such idiots.

35:03.713 --> 35:04.947
We're out of here.

35:05.848 --> 35:07.480
Where are you going?

35:07.482 --> 35:08.716
Later.

35:16.726 --> 35:19.427
I'm not allowed to take
public transportation.

35:19.796 --> 35:20.930
Me neither.

35:41.650 --> 35:42.752
Hi, person!

35:58.433 --> 35:59.934
<i>Judith, it's Ed Kingsley.</i>

35:59.936 --> 36:02.569
<i>I've been trying to reach
you for some time.</i>

36:02.571 --> 36:07.574
I understand you're in Los Angeles,
but it's important that we speak.

36:07.576 --> 36:10.643
We have some matters that
I think we need to discuss.

36:10.645 --> 36:11.881
<i>So, please, call me.</i>

36:13.015 --> 36:15.885
<i>It's not too late to reach
a deeper understanding.</i>

36:31.133 --> 36:32.367
Oh, my God.

36:33.736 --> 36:36.839
That's Judy Small. She's
the marriage counselor.

36:39.809 --> 36:43.911
Hey, yo, marriage counselor!

36:43.913 --> 36:45.114
What are you doing?

36:47.717 --> 36:49.517
Oh, crap.

37:25.154 --> 37:27.187
Oh! Oh, my God.

37:27.189 --> 37:28.488
She marked me.

37:28.490 --> 37:30.525
You need to tell your mother.

37:30.927 --> 37:33.794
I'm not allowed to take the bus.

37:33.796 --> 37:35.597
I don't know
what I'm doing wrong.

37:37.166 --> 37:44.006
I was hoping that by embarking on this
journey that my life would get better,

37:44.740 --> 37:47.708
but as weird as it sounds,
I think it's getting worse.

37:47.710 --> 37:49.509
How do you feel
it's getting worse?

37:49.511 --> 37:54.649
Well, I've found myself
daydreaming about my first husband,

37:56.618 --> 38:02.524
wondering what my life would
be like if Dominic hadn't died.

38:05.861 --> 38:12.068
You know, it's crazy, this life that
we have, you know, like you pick

38:13.069 --> 38:20.676
a husband which means you pick a
life, and he dies so it dies.

38:21.911 --> 38:26.648
Has it occurred to you
you're longing for justice?

38:28.550 --> 38:29.783
Justice?

38:29.785 --> 38:33.155
Payback for Bob's
past sexual infidelity?

38:36.859 --> 38:39.860
He told you about that?
About... about Sheila?

38:39.862 --> 38:43.330
It's important that we get
to the root of these issues.

38:43.332 --> 38:47.735
Oh, God, but I... I didn't
think he still cared about that.

38:47.737 --> 38:49.504
Did you think it was trivial?

38:52.008 --> 38:55.011
Are you not aware that your husband
is an exceedingly attractive man?

38:57.046 --> 39:00.748
I know he's an attractive man.

39:00.750 --> 39:04.650
It may be that you
need to take action.

39:04.652 --> 39:06.453
Take action?

39:06.455 --> 39:14.261
In order to make peace with his sexual history,
you may need to rebalance the sexual scales.

39:14.263 --> 39:15.663
The sexual scales?

39:16.032 --> 39:17.297
The power dynamic.

39:17.299 --> 39:19.233
I'm so confused.

39:19.235 --> 39:21.871
You may need to even the score.

39:34.016 --> 39:34.817
Hey!

39:35.718 --> 39:36.685
Hi.

39:39.288 --> 39:43.357
So tell me upfront, is
this work or pleasure?

39:44.927 --> 39:46.060
Hmm.

39:46.062 --> 39:50.266
Hey, can I get a martini
straight up twist? Thank you.

39:51.333 --> 39:55.069
Or does this have something to do with
Reed and Walter's new business venture?

39:55.071 --> 39:57.104
Wait, wait. How did
you hear about that?

39:57.106 --> 40:01.310
Oh, Reed mentioned it to
me a while ago, you know,

40:02.812 --> 40:04.011
pillow talk.

40:04.013 --> 40:05.779
Oh, hmm.

40:05.781 --> 40:09.016
No, no, that has... that
has nothing to do with that,

40:09.018 --> 40:14.054
or your work by the way which is great,
yeah, across the board, excellent.

40:14.056 --> 40:14.822
- Yes.
- Cheers!

40:14.824 --> 40:15.825
Thank you.

40:19.929 --> 40:26.967
No, Reed came into my office the other
day, and he's concerned that-

40:26.969 --> 40:31.240
that there might be some,
I don't know, bad blood or...

40:33.142 --> 40:34.942
What an asshole he is?

40:34.944 --> 40:35.678
Ha-ha.

40:37.279 --> 40:38.280
You know how, uh,

40:40.716 --> 40:46.755
sometimes you can want something but
then not even realize that you want it?

40:47.223 --> 40:49.256
Yes, yes, I do.

40:49.258 --> 40:52.261
I had wanted to leave my
husband for a very long time,

40:54.230 --> 40:56.365
and then when Reed
stepped in, I just-

40:58.467 --> 41:01.702
I kind of just let myself
get carried away by him.

41:01.704 --> 41:08.809
The shock was how fast and scared he
ran because I never even mentioned

41:08.811 --> 41:13.282
the word sexual harassment, but since he
put it in my head, I don't know, I mean,

41:15.384 --> 41:20.954
I'm tempted, and I would do it, too, if I
had to, you know, just to protect my job.

41:20.956 --> 41:23.926
Well, of course you would,
of course, no question.

41:30.332 --> 41:31.834
You're married, right?

41:34.136 --> 41:35.102
Yes, I am.

41:35.104 --> 41:37.907
- Yes, you are.
- There it is, the evidence.

41:39.942 --> 41:43.145
I was married for 13 years.

41:43.879 --> 41:45.779
Wow! Just three for me.

41:45.781 --> 41:48.115
Ooh, that's long enough.

41:49.485 --> 41:51.820
Well, yeah.

41:54.390 --> 41:57.357
Hmm, you want to get
another one of these?

41:57.359 --> 41:58.427
Yeah, why not?

41:59.862 --> 42:01.897
I mean, I have time
for a quickie.

42:21.917 --> 42:23.152
Thank you.

42:24.987 --> 42:26.255
Thank you.

42:43.973 --> 42:45.505
Hi.

42:45.507 --> 42:46.974
Oh, thank you.

42:46.976 --> 42:49.910
Yippee! I think I
found you a job.

42:49.912 --> 42:51.511
What?

42:51.513 --> 42:54.047
Pinot furniture, genius designer, you
have to fly to San Francisco to meet him.

42:54.049 --> 42:55.349
- Okay?
- Oh, thank you.

42:55.351 --> 42:56.316
Okay.

42:56.318 --> 42:58.885
You have to meet Serge.
He's married to Stern.

42:58.887 --> 43:01.288
Now, she's a star,
but he's pretty amazing.

43:01.290 --> 43:03.557
Serge, this is my friend Susan.

43:03.559 --> 43:04.858
Oh, hello.

43:04.860 --> 43:06.460
- We have known each other for...
- Oh!

43:06.462 --> 43:07.429
Oh, I'm sorry.

43:08.364 --> 43:10.130
Serge is the host
of the stellar affair.

43:10.132 --> 43:14.234
Delighted to have you.
Spread your wings, celebrate.

43:14.236 --> 43:17.439
- Thank you.
- This is Stern.

43:18.173 --> 43:19.339
Stern, this is my friend Susan.

43:19.341 --> 43:21.141
Hi, welcome.

43:21.143 --> 43:22.876
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

43:22.878 --> 43:24.446
All right. Let's do it.

43:25.314 --> 43:26.348
Hmm.

43:27.883 --> 43:29.251
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

43:30.419 --> 43:32.586
So tell me, I'm curious...

43:32.588 --> 43:34.087
Mm-hmm.

43:34.089 --> 43:37.226
...how did it all work, you know, like,
did your... did your husband move out?

43:39.228 --> 43:41.528
I'm... no, I'm just... I'm just
curious about the logistics.

43:41.530 --> 43:42.929
I'm a logistics guy.

43:42.931 --> 43:47.536
Do you want to know
the secret to a divorce?

43:48.170 --> 43:49.271
Hmm.

43:49.872 --> 43:52.274
It is the best thing
in the world.

43:52.641 --> 43:55.108
It is fantastic.

43:55.110 --> 43:58.480
I mean, I just can't believe how long I
tied myself in knots trying to avoid it.

43:59.048 --> 44:00.647
It's like taking out the trash.

44:00.649 --> 44:03.852
You do it, and bam! It's done.

44:05.020 --> 44:08.524
Wow! So just like
that? 13 years? Out.

44:10.025 --> 44:10.926
Done.

44:13.262 --> 44:14.430
So tell me another secret?

44:16.598 --> 44:18.065
What?

44:18.067 --> 44:20.600
- So now you want to know all my secrets, huh?
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

44:20.602 --> 44:22.404
- Yeah.
- Some I do wanna know, yes.

44:24.973 --> 44:28.977
All right. Well, the truth is,

44:30.112 --> 44:32.948
it's all easy, everything,

44:35.117 --> 44:36.118
anything.

44:36.518 --> 44:37.286
Huh.

44:38.654 --> 44:43.357
Once you realize that everything
is structured to keep us down...

44:43.359 --> 44:44.358
Pressed down.

44:44.360 --> 44:46.960
Yes, frightened of ourselves.

44:46.962 --> 44:48.628
Yeah. But not you?

44:48.630 --> 44:49.598
Uh-uh.

44:50.999 --> 44:52.067
No, not me.

44:54.103 --> 44:55.135
Not anymore.

44:55.137 --> 44:56.038
Mm-hmm.

44:57.139 --> 44:58.071
Mm-hmm.

44:58.073 --> 45:00.307
- No, no, no, no!
- Yes!

45:00.309 --> 45:03.212
Everybody drives
better on two martinis.

45:03.680 --> 45:06.215
- Everybody knows that.
- Oh.

45:09.051 --> 45:13.120
That, sir, is my carriage.

45:13.122 --> 45:14.221
I can't.

45:14.223 --> 45:17.459
This... this is my chariot.

45:20.462 --> 45:22.264
- Have a good night.
- Good night.

45:24.500 --> 45:26.301
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

45:32.474 --> 45:34.641
- Hello.
- Where the hell are you?

45:34.643 --> 45:36.143
Oh, shit, I'm sorry.

45:36.145 --> 45:41.281
I'm sorry. I... I was held up at work
and I... I'm leaving right now. Bye.

45:41.283 --> 45:42.683
Hurry, please.

45:42.685 --> 45:44.153
I'll see you at work.

45:55.631 --> 45:56.930
To our new venture!

45:56.932 --> 46:00.133
And to those of us lucky enough
to get in on the ground floor...

46:00.135 --> 46:02.669
There's nothing I love
more than making money.

46:02.671 --> 46:05.773
Hey, we saw an
opportunity and we seized it.

46:05.775 --> 46:08.341
- Yeah.
- Perch me that deal!

46:08.343 --> 46:09.777
- Wooh!
- Yeah.

46:09.779 --> 46:13.282
- Cheers, darling, cheers.
- Right. Right.

46:14.450 --> 46:17.017
I'm sorry I'm late.
Crazy traffic.

46:17.019 --> 46:18.654
South Island, they'll see you.

46:19.288 --> 46:20.487
Congratulations, Nick.

46:20.489 --> 46:21.655
- Thank you.
- Well, that's the point of money, darling.

46:21.657 --> 46:24.524
We don't want to be sitting
ducks for the apocalypse.

46:24.526 --> 46:26.761
That's the symptom,
the fear of O.

46:26.763 --> 46:28.161
The fear of O?

46:28.163 --> 46:30.397
Ouroboros, the serpent
that eats its own tail.

46:30.399 --> 46:31.498
Right, right.

46:31.500 --> 46:32.733
None of us is immune.

46:32.735 --> 46:34.234
It happened to me last week.

46:34.236 --> 46:35.803
Why, what happened?

46:35.805 --> 46:39.105
I'm driving home from the gym at 6:00
a.m., Mulholland, I'm at a red light

46:39.107 --> 46:43.711
when three guys cut me off, pulled me
out of the car, stick a gun in my face,

46:43.713 --> 46:46.814
and discuss whether or not
they're gonna blow me away.

46:46.816 --> 46:50.552
They take my wallet, my watch, my rings, my
cell phone, get in the car, and drive off.

46:51.119 --> 46:53.053
It's the end of a
civilized world.

46:53.055 --> 46:54.521
It is inevitable.

46:54.523 --> 46:56.189
I, for one, refuse to surrender.

46:56.191 --> 46:59.059
- Did they find your car?
- Who the fuck is they?

46:59.061 --> 47:01.161
Darling, be nice.

47:01.163 --> 47:03.630
They... there ain't no they.

47:03.632 --> 47:07.369
You can kiss goodbye the idea that there's someone
out there who is gonna make it all better

47:08.170 --> 47:11.071
because the guys on the white
horses have all run scared.

47:11.073 --> 47:12.441
That's true, yeah.

47:13.075 --> 47:14.574
Where on earth did you
find these people?

47:14.576 --> 47:18.345
Oh, I know. Aren't they
great? Stern is fabulous.

47:18.347 --> 47:20.480
Are you okay?
You look dehydrated.

47:20.482 --> 47:25.020
Um, I need to talk to
you about Judy Small.

47:25.822 --> 47:28.154
Ah, I am getting fat.

47:28.156 --> 47:31.191
You are pregnant with triplets.

47:31.193 --> 47:32.225
Yeah.

47:32.227 --> 47:35.564
Judy Small thinks that
I should have an affair.

47:38.868 --> 47:43.603
She said I needed to even the sexual score because,
you know, Bob had that thing with Sheila.

47:43.605 --> 47:45.672
But that doesn't count. That
was before you were married.

47:45.674 --> 47:47.476
Judy Small seems
to think it counts.

47:50.212 --> 47:53.048
Maybe she just thinks you
need to have a little fun, huh?

47:56.118 --> 47:57.852
- Let's see what I have here.
- Oh, so...

47:57.854 --> 47:59.219
Yes.

47:59.221 --> 48:00.255
Have fun.

48:00.656 --> 48:02.122
Try these.

48:02.124 --> 48:03.623
In fact, take the bottle.

48:03.625 --> 48:04.624
I can't take it anymore
'cause I'm pregnant.

48:04.626 --> 48:05.828
They'll help you unwind.

48:07.462 --> 48:09.262
I need to unwind.

48:09.264 --> 48:10.530
- You really do.
- I'm really stressed.

48:10.532 --> 48:11.400
- You really are.
- Okay.

48:12.200 --> 48:13.633
- Ah.
- Mm-hmm.

48:13.635 --> 48:15.203
- Go on.
- Ahh.

48:36.425 --> 48:39.294
Yeah! You should get out more.

48:53.342 --> 48:55.776
Come on. We're going home.

48:55.778 --> 48:57.780
Right now. Now.

48:58.347 --> 48:58.881
This way.

48:59.682 --> 49:00.382
Bye.

49:02.284 --> 49:03.886
Wooh! Who's next?

49:07.790 --> 49:10.158
Bob Howard,

49:10.760 --> 49:14.563
you are a tight,

49:15.197 --> 49:19.566
secretive, little man.

49:19.568 --> 49:22.905
Jesus Christ! How much did
you have to drink tonight, huh?

49:23.605 --> 49:25.440
Oh, boo-hoo.

49:25.875 --> 49:29.710
I guess you'll have to tell
your therapist all about it.

49:29.712 --> 49:30.813
Oh, wow!

49:33.850 --> 49:35.916
Maybe I should have an affair.

49:35.918 --> 49:38.886
Yeah, maybe you should.
Why? Are you thinking about it?

49:38.888 --> 49:39.954
Maybe.

49:39.956 --> 49:41.287
You're incredible,
you know that?

49:41.289 --> 49:44.925
Do you mean me, or
do you mean Sheila?

49:44.927 --> 49:46.459
Sheila?

49:46.461 --> 49:50.463
She must be on your mind or else you
wouldn't have told Judy Small about her.

49:50.465 --> 49:52.900
I didn't tell Judy Small
about her. You did.

49:52.902 --> 49:57.972
I didn't tell Judy Small about
your sexual transgressions.

49:57.974 --> 50:01.776
She told me that you told her so
don't pretend that you didn't.

50:01.778 --> 50:04.881
- This is so fucked up.
- Yeah, bingo!

50:05.514 --> 50:06.613
Your fault.

50:06.615 --> 50:08.015
- Bingo.
- Bingo.

50:08.017 --> 50:12.519
You know what, Susan? If you were
smart, you'd know that I'm a man.

50:12.521 --> 50:15.622
Yeah, such an attractive man.

50:15.624 --> 50:16.924
Yeah, that's right.

50:16.926 --> 50:19.559
I'm an attractive man
with needs of his own.

50:23.565 --> 50:26.601
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,
ha, ha, ha, ha.

50:33.542 --> 50:36.946
You know, I'm... I'm
having a really hard time

50:37.680 --> 50:42.785
getting comfortable with your
suggestion that I even the score.

50:43.518 --> 50:45.585
Is that what you think I said?

50:45.587 --> 50:46.989
That's what I know you said.

50:48.623 --> 50:52.729
I mean, you can't be implying that I'm
the one who said I should have an affair.

50:54.596 --> 50:56.864
I would entertain that idea.

50:56.866 --> 50:58.735
That's a very real possibility,

51:00.535 --> 51:06.441
and you can certainly grant me that you must
be finding your impulses pretty scary, hmm?

51:06.909 --> 51:09.846
Isn't that what you learned
by your behavior at the party?

51:10.545 --> 51:13.714
Bob said he didn't
tell you about Sheila.

51:13.716 --> 51:17.519
I can't discuss what
Bob said or didn't say.

51:18.955 --> 51:20.890
You know I don't think
you like me very much.

51:23.558 --> 51:24.659
This

51:25.762 --> 51:27.462
is going to help you

51:29.631 --> 51:30.733
relax

51:31.968 --> 51:33.268
and open.

51:35.537 --> 51:36.571
Okay.

51:37.572 --> 51:38.941
Why don't you tell me

51:40.710 --> 51:42.678
whatever is going
through your mind?

51:43.946 --> 51:45.280
All right. Uh...

51:46.682 --> 51:47.049
Oh!

51:48.151 --> 51:50.885
You know what? I had
the craziest dream last night.

51:50.887 --> 51:51.886
Oh.

51:51.888 --> 51:52.753
Yeah.

51:52.755 --> 51:53.653
Wow.

51:53.655 --> 51:54.855
Tell me about it.

51:54.857 --> 51:55.657
Um...

51:57.559 --> 51:59.960
I was on this rowboat
with Annabelle.

51:59.962 --> 52:02.395
You know that woman
from work I told you about?

52:02.397 --> 52:03.898
Yes.

52:03.900 --> 52:08.871
Yeah, so we were on this rowboat and...
and, you know, she's there and

52:10.539 --> 52:11.874
I'm watching a fish-

52:14.043 --> 52:16.913
just luminescent fish
like a rainbow trout.

52:18.446 --> 52:24.086
And so, I'm... I turned back to
Annabelle and she's undressing.

52:24.821 --> 52:26.856
Actually, you know what? No.

52:27.924 --> 52:29.324
That's not true.

52:30.425 --> 52:33.996
I was undressing her,
and we are in a hotel room,

52:34.563 --> 52:38.801
and she was naked except
for this black brassiere.

52:41.436 --> 52:45.975
And she took the brassiere off,

52:46.575 --> 52:47.409
but

52:48.778 --> 52:50.510
when she did,

52:50.512 --> 52:53.613
I don't know, I get tangled up
around my head or something.

52:53.615 --> 52:55.017
I just... I couldn't
see anything.

52:55.885 --> 53:01.521
Even in your dreams your
sexual wish is frustrated.

53:01.523 --> 53:03.525
Yeah, that... that's
exactly what I thought.

53:04.026 --> 53:08.030
I was feeling frustrated
and entangled,

53:08.798 --> 53:14.003
then I was home, and I was
laying on the couch, and

53:14.636 --> 53:18.671
all of a sudden there was a loud
knock, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

53:18.673 --> 53:19.974
It was scary.

53:19.976 --> 53:22.710
I jumped out. My heart
was beating like a rabbit.

53:22.712 --> 53:24.577
I ran over to the door
and I answered it.

53:24.579 --> 53:28.883
Then there was this
woman standing there,

53:28.885 --> 53:32.853
but you couldn't see anything

53:32.855 --> 53:37.457
'cause it was nighttime, and there
was, you know, not a lot of light.

53:37.459 --> 53:38.959
I couldn't tell who it was.

53:38.961 --> 53:40.428
I think it was Annabelle,

53:43.799 --> 53:46.102
but I also think it
might have been you.

53:47.502 --> 53:48.436
Yes.

53:50.572 --> 53:51.539
Go on.

53:52.975 --> 53:54.409
And I-

53:57.880 --> 53:59.949
and I felt this powerful desire,

54:00.917 --> 54:02.484
and the end.

54:03.518 --> 54:04.186
It was really weird.

54:07.957 --> 54:12.661
It's so painful to feel that I
have to win your approval.

54:16.132 --> 54:18.265
Of course it's sexual.

54:18.267 --> 54:24.006
She's caster eating him, and there's
such just such agony to sit by and watch

54:24.673 --> 54:26.909
which is all you analysts
know how to do anyway.

54:27.810 --> 54:31.546
Oh, how good
it would feel just

54:32.148 --> 54:33.714
to fire you.

54:33.716 --> 54:36.584
You know that?
Such a suck at chat.

54:40.022 --> 54:46.228
It's just so hard 'cause I'm doing
everything that I know how to do.

54:50.733 --> 54:53.033
I just know I'm right this time.

54:53.035 --> 54:55.235
It can't be what you say.

54:55.237 --> 54:56.538
It can't!

54:56.973 --> 54:58.538
It just can't.

54:58.540 --> 55:00.176
I know it.

55:04.814 --> 55:09.615
And I've tried several times to reach
you, Judith, so please call me back.

55:09.617 --> 55:12.786
I'm in Los Angeles, and
you know the number.

55:12.788 --> 55:15.725
I... I look forward
to hearing from you.

55:17.659 --> 55:19.929
- I want to talk to you.
- Okay.

55:20.830 --> 55:22.530
About the therapy.

55:23.332 --> 55:25.633
- Okay.
- I'm having second thoughts.

55:27.737 --> 55:29.739
Second thoughts, huh?

55:30.806 --> 55:31.639
Okay.

55:32.674 --> 55:33.741
Um...

55:33.743 --> 55:35.244
- Thank you.
- Thank you, baby.

55:36.578 --> 55:37.179
What is that?

55:38.014 --> 55:38.511
- I don't know.
- What's the problem?

55:38.513 --> 55:40.016
No return address.

55:47.123 --> 55:48.124
Hmm.

55:58.267 --> 55:59.735
Is there a note?

56:00.202 --> 56:01.203
Uh...

56:07.977 --> 56:08.641
No signature.

56:08.643 --> 56:09.810
Okay, but what does it say?

56:09.812 --> 56:11.247
It says "What you desire."

56:13.682 --> 56:15.149
Is this a joke?

56:15.151 --> 56:17.317
- Well, I didn't send it.
- Of course you didn't, but who the hell did?

56:17.319 --> 56:19.855
Don't ask me. I don't...
I'll call the company.

56:21.791 --> 56:23.223
Is there something
you wanna tell me?

56:23.225 --> 56:25.726
No, absolutely not.

56:25.728 --> 56:29.296
Okay, fine, whatever,
but I'm telling you this.

56:29.298 --> 56:31.867
I want us out of the therapy.

56:33.402 --> 56:34.802
What? You don't think...

56:34.804 --> 56:38.205
I don't know what to think,
but I want that woman out of our lives.

56:38.207 --> 56:40.309
You're breaking your
commitment to therapy.

56:42.044 --> 56:43.677
It hasn't worked for me.

56:43.679 --> 56:47.981
Well, you refuse to open up,
but your need is bottomless.

56:47.983 --> 56:49.049
You're in flight.

56:49.051 --> 56:51.885
My needs are not bottomless.

56:51.887 --> 56:53.887
You're running away, Susan.

56:53.889 --> 56:55.322
No, I'm not.

56:55.324 --> 56:59.661
You are, but at the same
time you want my love.

57:00.296 --> 57:01.962
This is foul.

57:01.964 --> 57:06.300
You want my love, and you're willing to
undermine Bob in order to win in my eyes.

57:06.302 --> 57:07.801
I don't even know what
you're talking about.

57:07.803 --> 57:11.038
I have to get on a plane to San
Francisco tomorrow so I'm gonna go now.

57:11.040 --> 57:13.073
Oh, to San Francisco?

57:13.075 --> 57:15.242
I am leaving and I
am not coming back.

57:15.244 --> 57:16.378
That is why I came here.

57:18.013 --> 57:20.914
Aren't you concerned about Bob and Louise
being alone together while you run off

57:20.916 --> 57:26.420
to San Francisco because you are
a morass of hungers and impulses,

57:26.422 --> 57:30.290
and you just jump into therapy,
and just as quickly you just jump right out

57:30.292 --> 57:32.826
because you got to go.

57:32.828 --> 57:35.295
You got to go off
to San Francisco.

57:35.297 --> 57:39.066
Oh, not even a care about the
chaos that you leave in your wake.

57:39.068 --> 57:43.003
You think that you
don't need me?

57:43.005 --> 57:45.274
I think you're the
one who needs help.

57:46.242 --> 57:47.374
You need me.

57:49.912 --> 57:52.281
Oh, Susan, you need me.

57:53.382 --> 57:55.784
You need me, Susan!

57:57.319 --> 57:59.054
You need me!

58:08.731 --> 58:09.431
Fuck!

58:11.834 --> 58:14.735
Oh, I hope I lose my mind.

58:14.737 --> 58:17.306
I hope I go crazy
and hallucinate.

58:23.479 --> 58:25.347
- Let me try.
- Wow.

58:29.785 --> 58:32.288
Hold it in, don't breathe.

58:35.157 --> 58:36.292
Your mom smokes pot?

58:41.063 --> 58:42.429
She's scared I'll find out.

58:42.431 --> 58:45.434
Well, you know what? My
mother is scared of doors.

58:47.303 --> 58:51.207
My mother is scared
of buttons. Why?

58:54.543 --> 58:58.214
My mother... my mother is
scared of the word mucus.

59:02.284 --> 59:06.253
My mother is scared
of the word horny.

59:06.255 --> 59:09.358
Oh, that's so gross.

59:10.793 --> 59:12.893
Oh, I'm starving.

59:12.895 --> 59:14.029
Let's order pizza.

59:40.589 --> 59:42.391
It's been a long time, Judith.

59:44.360 --> 59:46.860
Two years, seven
months, nine days.

59:46.862 --> 59:49.229
I assume there's a reason
you hunted me down.

59:49.231 --> 59:51.467
Well, I wanted to talk to you.

59:52.167 --> 59:53.102
Oh.

59:54.103 --> 59:55.135
Talk.

59:55.137 --> 59:56.372
I hate talk.

59:58.374 --> 59:59.174
Look,

1:00:00.242 --> 1:00:02.976
no one even knew that
you resumed your practice.

1:00:02.978 --> 1:00:05.345
Why should they?
And why shouldn't I?

1:00:05.347 --> 1:00:09.116
Judith, please don't play
childish word games.

1:00:09.118 --> 1:00:11.285
You don't like word
games, Dr. Kingsley?

1:00:11.287 --> 1:00:16.023
- Judith.
- They stole... no, you stole my livelihood.

1:00:16.025 --> 1:00:17.291
I was framed.

1:00:17.293 --> 1:00:20.594
I understand how you felt, but
I did everything that I could.

1:00:20.596 --> 1:00:22.963
- No.
- Perhaps I could have done more but nonetheless I...

1:00:22.965 --> 1:00:24.031
No, no. I... I did.

1:00:24.033 --> 1:00:26.867
I did everything
for Benjamin Price.

1:00:26.869 --> 1:00:29.169
I did everything.

1:00:29.171 --> 1:00:34.076
I did more than any therapist on
earth would have done for him.

1:00:34.576 --> 1:00:39.081
No other ethical therapist in the
opinion of the licensing board.

1:00:40.049 --> 1:00:42.382
Look, Judith, it's not too late.

1:00:42.384 --> 1:00:48.090
You still have a chance to redeem yourself,
to appeal, and I will support you in that.

1:00:48.457 --> 1:00:51.491
Oh, God, spare me
the lecture, Dr. Kingsley.

1:00:51.493 --> 1:00:53.660
Look, you don't even
have a license to practice.

1:00:53.662 --> 1:00:54.995
It's California.

1:00:54.997 --> 1:00:56.596
Nobody here cares
about licenses.

1:00:56.598 --> 1:00:58.534
Judith, you're making
a mockery of me.

1:01:00.135 --> 1:01:01.769
Bingo!

1:01:01.771 --> 1:01:06.073
Look, you were always a challenge, but I
had hoped that you'd make more progress,

1:01:06.075 --> 1:01:10.077
that you'd dismantled some of
those self-destructive impulses.

1:01:10.079 --> 1:01:12.147
I think you need
to return to therapy.

1:01:16.485 --> 1:01:17.651
You think I need more treatment?

1:01:17.653 --> 1:01:19.419
Well, we weren't
finished when you left.

1:01:19.421 --> 1:01:22.558
So you came here to rescue me?

1:01:23.459 --> 1:01:24.393
Is that what you did?

1:01:25.027 --> 1:01:26.560
Oh, it's so kind.

1:01:26.562 --> 1:01:33.435
Oh, Dr. Kingsley,
that is so, so dedicated.

1:01:34.036 --> 1:01:38.105
If you return to New York we
can complete your therapy there.

1:01:38.107 --> 1:01:42.511
Well, then why wait? Let's
do it right here, right now.

1:01:43.946 --> 1:01:46.048
Let's go, Dr. Kingsley.

1:02:05.467 --> 1:02:12.072
What did you expect when you violate all
the tenets of neutrality when you follow me

1:02:12.074 --> 1:02:16.576
like an animal, when you hunt me
down, when you violate my privacy?

1:02:16.578 --> 1:02:21.515
I am such an interesting subject
to you, am I not, Dr. Kingsley?

1:02:21.517 --> 1:02:25.051
Flattering yourselves? I
need you? I don't need you.

1:02:25.053 --> 1:02:26.153
I don't.

1:02:26.155 --> 1:02:28.555
Ask yourself this,
why are you here?

1:02:28.557 --> 1:02:32.492
Why are you crossing boundaries
yet again, Dr. Kingsley?

1:02:32.494 --> 1:02:35.629
Everything I learned,
I learned from you except

1:02:35.631 --> 1:02:37.631
that when I needed you,
you abandoned me!

1:02:37.633 --> 1:02:40.269
Bingo! Bingo! Bingo!

1:02:40.669 --> 1:02:42.271
Judy!

1:03:11.467 --> 1:03:12.199
Hello.

1:03:12.201 --> 1:03:13.768
I thought you'd never answer.

1:03:13.770 --> 1:03:16.570
<i>I'm sorry. I was stumped
on at a crossword clue.</i>

1:03:16.572 --> 1:03:19.072
I have to go in like two minutes.
I have dinner with Ronald.

1:03:19.074 --> 1:03:20.542
Oh, yeah? Well, uh,

1:03:21.310 --> 1:03:23.410
I mean, how'd... how'd it go?
How'd the whole thing go?

1:03:23.412 --> 1:03:27.347
The furniture was beautiful,
but I'd have to commute.

1:03:27.349 --> 1:03:31.353
Just, um, anyway,
can I say hi to Louise?

1:03:32.789 --> 1:03:38.560
Um, no, I told Louise she
could spend the night at Zoe's.

1:03:42.364 --> 1:03:43.232
Um,

1:03:44.399 --> 1:03:45.467
what are you gonna do tonight?

1:03:46.168 --> 1:03:47.102
<i>Nothing.</i>

1:03:48.136 --> 1:03:50.339
I'm doing the crossword,
gonna eat some pizza,

1:03:50.807 --> 1:03:55.208
probably look at pictures of
cars I can't buy on the internet.

1:03:55.210 --> 1:03:56.512
I love you.

1:03:58.480 --> 1:03:59.481
I love you.

1:04:14.697 --> 1:04:19.134
Well, some stupid clue.

1:04:39.621 --> 1:04:40.788
Hi.

1:04:40.790 --> 1:04:42.057
Hello.

1:04:44.126 --> 1:04:45.325
Is Susan here?

1:04:45.327 --> 1:04:49.296
No, no, actually. No, she's
not. She's in San Francisco.

1:04:49.298 --> 1:04:50.599
San Francisco?

1:04:51.433 --> 1:04:52.434
Yeah.

1:04:53.803 --> 1:04:55.170
Back tomorrow.

1:05:01.176 --> 1:05:02.812
I'm sorry. Would
you like to come in?

1:05:10.419 --> 1:05:15.655
You know, sometimes I just wanna
light a light bulb, just like that,

1:05:15.657 --> 1:05:22.662
I guess, snap and fly a
bike with E.T., you know,

1:05:22.664 --> 1:05:24.598
- like a, b, c, d...
- What?

1:05:24.600 --> 1:05:28.535
- What did you say?
- E. T., j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, TV.

1:05:28.537 --> 1:05:30.838
You wanna watch E.T.?

1:05:30.840 --> 1:05:32.773
No.

1:05:32.775 --> 1:05:38.246
I wanna fly a bike
with E.T., you know?

1:05:38.948 --> 1:05:40.647
You wanna know something sad?

1:05:40.649 --> 1:05:41.615
Um?

1:05:41.617 --> 1:05:45.686
See, if I were to find
an alien, I'd kill him.

1:05:45.688 --> 1:05:47.822
Don't even look at me.

1:05:47.824 --> 1:05:48.889
- That's...
- I'm looking.

1:05:49.726 --> 1:05:50.459
Shit!

1:05:57.633 --> 1:05:58.801
Hey, Mom.

1:06:11.781 --> 1:06:12.947
How's Louise?

1:06:12.949 --> 1:06:15.382
Louise? She's staying over
at her friend's house tonight.

1:06:15.384 --> 1:06:17.350
Oh! Slumber party.

1:06:17.352 --> 1:06:18.953
That's right, yeah.

1:06:18.955 --> 1:06:20.455
Please, sit down.

1:06:24.761 --> 1:06:29.697
You know, as much as I was
hoping to see all three of you,

1:06:29.699 --> 1:06:32.401
I'm actually quite
happy that it's just you.

1:06:33.468 --> 1:06:34.937
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1:06:35.671 --> 1:06:36.806
How's that?

1:06:37.774 --> 1:06:39.807
Why do you look so scared, Bob?

1:06:39.809 --> 1:06:43.412
I'm not scared. I... it's just,

1:06:43.913 --> 1:06:47.850
you know, it's unusual when your
therapist drops by your house.

1:06:49.719 --> 1:06:55.858
Yes, it is very unorthodox,
I will grant you that.

1:06:56.458 --> 1:06:57.960
Do you want me to leave?

1:06:59.594 --> 1:07:00.763
No, I'm not...

1:07:01.998 --> 1:07:05.233
I don't want to be rude. I... no.

1:07:10.405 --> 1:07:11.339
Come sit.

1:07:20.950 --> 1:07:22.852
I have to tell you something.

1:07:29.391 --> 1:07:34.594
I've received some just
very devastating news.

1:07:34.596 --> 1:07:36.298
I have to leave LA.

1:07:36.899 --> 1:07:41.035
I have to leave and I don't
expect to come back.

1:07:41.037 --> 1:07:42.705
I don't have a lot of time.

1:07:43.672 --> 1:07:46.876
And I feel like we have some
unfinished business, you and I.

1:07:49.377 --> 1:07:50.479
Do you?

1:07:51.513 --> 1:07:54.917
This is... I...

1:08:00.455 --> 1:08:03.458
What if you just sit back,

1:08:07.029 --> 1:08:08.263
relax,

1:08:10.066 --> 1:08:11.868
and allow yourself

1:08:13.368 --> 1:08:17.606
to use this very last chance

1:08:20.375 --> 1:08:21.844
to free yourself?

1:08:22.912 --> 1:08:24.881
Have you two been
smoking marijuana?

1:08:27.950 --> 1:08:28.951
Uh-uh.

1:08:29.752 --> 1:08:33.522
It looks like you two have
been smoking marijuana.

1:08:35.457 --> 1:08:36.424
Yeah.

1:08:38.761 --> 1:08:41.095
All right. We are taking
Louise home right now.

1:08:41.097 --> 1:08:43.532
Now, just allow yourself

1:08:45.367 --> 1:08:47.069
to relax

1:08:48.537 --> 1:08:54.710
and drop in to this
present moment.

1:08:55.978 --> 1:08:57.914
A moment

1:08:59.481 --> 1:09:01.449
where you can remember

1:09:03.019 --> 1:09:04.553
who you are.

1:09:08.825 --> 1:09:10.625
Do you remember who you are?

1:09:12.427 --> 1:09:13.528
I don't know.

1:09:16.966 --> 1:09:17.934
I don't know.

1:09:18.533 --> 1:09:20.167
Have I told you you're a man?

1:09:20.169 --> 1:09:21.836
- Hmm.
- You're a man, right?

1:09:21.838 --> 1:09:22.738
Mm-hmm.

1:09:23.139 --> 1:09:24.941
A man has needs.

1:09:26.876 --> 1:09:31.946
Lots and lots of needs.

1:09:31.948 --> 1:09:34.984
When no one hears those needs,

1:09:35.685 --> 1:09:37.519
when those needs aren't met,

1:09:38.821 --> 1:09:40.823
a man can forget himself.

1:09:43.025 --> 1:09:45.094
Did you forget yourself, Bob?

1:09:46.996 --> 1:09:51.968
What if I told you
that you could have

1:09:58.174 --> 1:10:02.111
anything you

1:10:07.950 --> 1:10:08.784
wanted?

1:10:09.886 --> 1:10:12.086
Bye.

1:10:12.088 --> 1:10:15.189
Don't tell your mom that I yelled at you.
I want to remain in her social circle.

1:10:15.191 --> 1:10:16.656
I don't wanna be shunned.

1:10:16.658 --> 1:10:17.592
Go.

1:10:18.127 --> 1:10:19.626
- I love you.
- I love you more.

1:10:19.628 --> 1:10:21.896
Hey, we'll say goodbye 'cause you're
allowed to see your friend again.

1:10:21.898 --> 1:10:22.930
That's how it works.

1:10:22.932 --> 1:10:23.797
There's nothing
wrong with that.

1:10:23.799 --> 1:10:25.598
You lied to us, such
a party pooper.

1:10:25.600 --> 1:10:29.437
Not if you're laughing
when you forgot...

1:10:43.920 --> 1:10:46.155
Oh, my God.

1:10:46.856 --> 1:10:48.691
<i>Mommy's gonna kill you!</i>

1:10:49.191 --> 1:10:51.160
- Louise.
- Go away!

1:10:51.827 --> 1:10:53.794
- Please come inside.
- Go away!

1:10:53.796 --> 1:10:56.631
- It's cold out here.
- Leave me alone!

1:10:59.068 --> 1:11:00.169
Go!

1:11:12.580 --> 1:11:13.683
Uh,

1:11:15.685 --> 1:11:16.218
whoa.

1:11:17.887 --> 1:11:19.720
I feel so good to be home.

1:11:19.722 --> 1:11:21.956
Yeah, we're very happy
to have you home.

1:11:21.958 --> 1:11:25.127
That guy was such a jerk.
Oh, my God. It was embarrassing.

1:11:39.775 --> 1:11:42.477
Sweetie, are you alright?

1:11:45.715 --> 1:11:47.715
Do you want to come out
from underneath that hoodie

1:11:47.717 --> 1:11:50.086
and tell me what happened?
'Cause I can tell that something happened.

1:11:58.560 --> 1:12:00.162
Uh, is somebody dead?

1:12:00.730 --> 1:12:03.065
Jesus Christ!
What the hell happened?

1:12:03.799 --> 1:12:07.301
I came home last night and Bob
was on the couch with Judy Small,

1:12:07.303 --> 1:12:09.238
and it was really, really gross.

1:12:18.147 --> 1:12:21.715
Judy Small? The therapist
was in our house?

1:12:21.717 --> 1:12:26.120
Naked, and they were on the couch
doing stuff, and he was wearing a mask.

1:12:26.122 --> 1:12:30.558
First of all, let me just say that...
that I'm sorry, and no one was naked.

1:12:32.061 --> 1:12:35.896
I let... I let something
terrible happen but...

1:12:35.898 --> 1:12:39.601
How can there be a but?
I mean, and in front of Louise?

1:12:40.069 --> 1:12:42.271
Louise, sweetheart,
please go to your room.

1:12:43.039 --> 1:12:49.309
Susan, as God is my witness, the woman...
the woman came here to seduce me.

1:12:49.311 --> 1:12:51.145
I think I'm gonna vomit.

1:12:51.147 --> 1:12:52.846
I'm not pleading innocence.

1:12:52.848 --> 1:12:54.116
Oh!

1:12:55.617 --> 1:13:00.254
My therapist, our fucking
marriage counselor,

1:13:00.256 --> 1:13:04.691
on the first night in our
marriage that I go away?

1:13:04.693 --> 1:13:07.061
I didn't... I didn't
invite her here.

1:13:07.063 --> 1:13:09.363
The whole thing is
just fucking insane.

1:13:09.365 --> 1:13:13.200
You were naked wearing a mask.

1:13:13.202 --> 1:13:19.239
I'm trying... I'm trying to tell you
that under the circumstances the mistake-

1:13:19.241 --> 1:13:26.080
the very egregious and indefensible mistake
was it was very difficult to resist...

1:13:26.082 --> 1:13:30.784
I'm gonna fucking kill you.
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

1:13:31.653 --> 1:13:32.719
Susan, you don't...

1:13:32.721 --> 1:13:35.823
I swear to God I'll do it
when you're sleeping.

1:13:35.825 --> 1:13:38.859
I'm gonna stab you in the
heart with a meat thermometer.

1:13:38.861 --> 1:13:42.597
I'm gonna cut off your
balls with a corkscrew.

1:13:43.032 --> 1:13:44.865
Susie, you don't have
to be reacting this way.

1:13:44.867 --> 1:13:47.034
- Just...
- Just get out of here. I want you out now.

1:13:47.036 --> 1:13:48.268
- Please.
- Get out?

1:13:48.270 --> 1:13:50.973
Please, just go.
I don't wanna see your face!

1:13:52.041 --> 1:13:54.677
Go! Get out!

1:14:48.097 --> 1:14:51.033
Let's get a one room,
please, just me.

1:14:52.968 --> 1:14:54.270
Stay overnight.

1:16:11.513 --> 1:16:12.879
Judy.

1:16:24.994 --> 1:16:26.295
Have a good day.

1:16:39.875 --> 1:16:42.843
Bob, what a splendid surprise.

1:16:42.845 --> 1:16:46.413
Oh, sorry, I tried to call your cell, and
then your home number wasn't listed though.

1:16:46.415 --> 1:16:48.849
- Well...
- I didn't know how else to find you.

1:16:48.851 --> 1:16:52.619
I've been very busy packing,
making arrangements.

1:16:52.621 --> 1:16:54.056
Hmm.

1:16:55.391 --> 1:16:56.358
Have a seat.

1:17:00.396 --> 1:17:01.397
It's okay.

1:17:13.642 --> 1:17:15.442
Uh...

1:17:15.444 --> 1:17:24.186
I came here today to ask you to talk to Susan
for me and maybe just explain things to her.

1:17:27.022 --> 1:17:28.157
Darling,

1:17:32.394 --> 1:17:33.495
you're so scared,

1:17:34.963 --> 1:17:36.496
cornered, misunderstood.

1:17:36.498 --> 1:17:38.934
No, I love my wife,

1:17:40.102 --> 1:17:42.135
and I don't want to lose her.

1:17:42.137 --> 1:17:43.904
Of course you don't.

1:17:43.906 --> 1:17:49.912
So please, please just talk to her and just
tell her that this whole thing was insane.

1:17:50.946 --> 1:17:51.947
Insane?

1:17:52.448 --> 1:17:53.349
Yes.

1:18:03.525 --> 1:18:10.130
I would do almost anything for you
so, yeah, okay, I could talk to Susan.

1:18:10.132 --> 1:18:11.300
I could tell her... um,

1:18:12.736 --> 1:18:17.373
I could tell her that it wasn't
you who undressed me, but it was I

1:18:17.973 --> 1:18:21.009
who undressed you, and you

1:18:22.044 --> 1:18:23.178
didn't take me,

1:18:24.446 --> 1:18:29.216
but I who hoped in the course
of one reckless erotic journey...

1:18:29.218 --> 1:18:30.852
Maybe this was a bad idea.

1:18:30.854 --> 1:18:35.290
Oh, just enough with the flagellation over
a lousy blowjob, please, it's insulting.

1:18:36.291 --> 1:18:40.262
Seriously, you
need to relax, Bob.

1:18:41.997 --> 1:18:43.196
Let's do this.

1:18:43.198 --> 1:18:45.200
Let's do a calming exercise.

1:18:46.201 --> 1:18:48.736
I'm nervous, and
now I'm exhausted.

1:18:48.738 --> 1:18:52.072
Just a nice breathing exercise.
Can you do that for me?

1:18:52.074 --> 1:18:55.342
Please, please, Judy,
will you just talk to Susan?

1:18:55.344 --> 1:19:00.516
I will talk to Susan if you promise me
that you're gonna do this for me, okay?

1:19:01.250 --> 1:19:02.649
You're gonna be a good boy.

1:19:02.651 --> 1:19:04.219
Yeah, I will do
anything you want.

1:19:04.721 --> 1:19:08.689
Okay. You're gonna count
from 10 down to one.

1:19:08.691 --> 1:19:11.393
Okay? 10...

1:19:13.495 --> 1:19:14.494
Ten.

1:19:14.496 --> 1:19:15.431
Nine.

1:19:27.309 --> 1:19:29.344
You are not listening to me.

1:19:30.512 --> 1:19:32.078
There's no more money.

1:19:32.080 --> 1:19:34.147
It's all gone. Everything.

1:19:34.149 --> 1:19:37.284
Nicky invested every single penny
of our money with that lying bitch,

1:19:37.286 --> 1:19:39.054
and she just cut and ran.

1:19:39.621 --> 1:19:42.222
What are you doing here?

1:19:42.224 --> 1:19:43.657
I live here, remember?

1:19:43.659 --> 1:19:45.127
Oh, God, don't remind me.

1:19:46.462 --> 1:19:49.565
I just spent $200, money we don't
have, unblocking my energy.

1:19:50.232 --> 1:19:52.735
One word from him,
money down the drain.

1:19:54.536 --> 1:19:56.205
I guess Roxy told
you the bad news.

1:19:56.773 --> 1:19:57.738
Yeah.

1:19:57.740 --> 1:19:59.272
Don't talk.

1:19:59.274 --> 1:20:02.044
Okay? Just don't make a sound.

1:20:03.111 --> 1:20:04.244
How's Bob?

1:20:04.246 --> 1:20:05.512
I don't know.

1:20:05.514 --> 1:20:07.247
I don't care.

1:20:07.249 --> 1:20:10.517
I heard there's some weird shit going down
at his place, some kind of slash-and-burn.

1:20:10.519 --> 1:20:16.323
Why are you here? Why aren't you out
looking for a job? What about our babies?

1:20:16.325 --> 1:20:18.558
Yeah, actually, I was thinking
about getting a tattoo.

1:20:18.560 --> 1:20:21.061
You cannot afford a tattoo.

1:20:21.063 --> 1:20:24.765
You cannot afford to take a shit on
the ground that you're standing on.

1:20:24.767 --> 1:20:26.435
I can shit anywhere I like.

1:20:28.237 --> 1:20:29.204
I hate him.

1:20:30.172 --> 1:20:31.607
I really fucking hate him.

1:20:32.207 --> 1:20:33.674
I hate his guts.

1:20:33.676 --> 1:20:37.079
Yeah, I hate them. I
hate them. I hate them all.

1:20:37.680 --> 1:20:39.346
How many tranquilizers
do you need?

1:20:39.348 --> 1:20:40.681
Oh, I'll take as many
as you can spare.

1:20:40.683 --> 1:20:42.618
Oh, honey, I got plenty.

1:20:49.191 --> 1:20:53.326
Oh, Nick is gonna find
a job, sweetie, he is.

1:20:53.328 --> 1:20:55.097
Susan, he's a writer.

1:20:55.531 --> 1:20:56.799
What the fuck can a writer do?

1:21:01.738 --> 1:21:02.571
Good morning.

1:21:04.206 --> 1:21:05.374
Ooh, ouch.

1:21:07.576 --> 1:21:09.444
Ooh, that looked painful.

1:21:10.112 --> 1:21:12.145
I'm so sorry.

1:21:12.147 --> 1:21:14.616
Hey, don't be mad at me.

1:21:15.250 --> 1:21:19.321
Hey, I never meant to hurt you.

1:21:20.790 --> 1:21:22.792
It's weird he hasn't called.

1:21:25.527 --> 1:21:27.394
I bet something bad happened.

1:21:27.396 --> 1:21:30.463
Oh, no, Louise. Don't say that.

1:21:30.465 --> 1:21:33.368
I mean, he's dumb,
but he's not that dumb.

1:21:34.136 --> 1:21:36.469
Like, if he were okay he'd call.

1:21:36.471 --> 1:21:39.239
Maybe you should call him.

1:21:39.241 --> 1:21:41.343
Why? He's your husband.

1:21:41.811 --> 1:21:46.548
It would be such a human
gesture, a forgiving thing,

1:21:47.282 --> 1:21:54.656
considering the fact that even as
inadequate as he is, he loves you.

1:22:05.802 --> 1:22:07.870
Bet you've got him
to an accident.

1:22:11.506 --> 1:22:12.374
Hello?

1:22:12.842 --> 1:22:13.874
It's Louise.

1:22:13.876 --> 1:22:14.777
Is Bob there?

1:22:17.680 --> 1:22:19.648
Well, do you know where he is?

1:22:20.582 --> 1:22:21.583
Never?

1:22:22.217 --> 1:22:23.285
Okay, bye.

1:22:24.954 --> 1:22:29.623
He never showed up at work even though he
had a meeting with the writer from Alaska.

1:22:29.625 --> 1:22:31.560
Something's definitely wrong.

1:22:33.662 --> 1:22:36.697
So much is wrong,
I don't even know where...

1:22:36.699 --> 1:22:40.701
Well, he... he... he could be in
jail, or bleeding to death somewhere.

1:22:40.703 --> 1:22:42.703
- Louise.
- Or else he could have a heart attack.

1:22:42.705 --> 1:22:44.805
- Don't say that.
- I'm sorry.

1:22:44.807 --> 1:22:46.941
I can tell you're
already freaking out.

1:22:46.943 --> 1:22:50.543
I'm not freaking out.
I'm just a little tired.

1:22:50.545 --> 1:22:52.614
I think we're better
off facing the truth.

1:22:53.649 --> 1:22:56.549
I'm having a very
painful realization.

1:22:56.551 --> 1:22:57.285
What?

1:22:59.822 --> 1:23:01.989
I still love Bob.

1:23:01.991 --> 1:23:05.327
Oh, my God. I thought
that's why you married him.

1:23:07.262 --> 1:23:11.899
It's crazy how easy it is to forget
how much someone means to you

1:23:11.901 --> 1:23:20.475
even if they've been a complete
reptile, all their fuck-ups and flaws.

1:23:21.978 --> 1:23:25.445
Oh, baby, if anything ever happened
to him I don't know if I...

1:23:25.447 --> 1:23:26.346
Mom, not now.

1:23:26.348 --> 1:23:27.482
Okay.

1:23:31.988 --> 1:23:34.554
I bet you it has something
to do with Judy Small.

1:23:34.556 --> 1:23:35.756
Judy Small.

1:23:35.758 --> 1:23:36.824
Judy Small.

1:23:36.826 --> 1:23:38.226
Judy.

1:23:42.364 --> 1:23:43.231
Judy?

1:24:00.783 --> 1:24:01.918
Filed a report.

1:24:03.385 --> 1:24:07.387
If we haven't heard from him in 24
hours, we'll just have to come back.

1:24:07.389 --> 1:24:08.756
Well, that's dumb.

1:24:08.758 --> 1:24:09.992
What if tomorrow is too late?

1:24:10.860 --> 1:24:13.326
I can't make you
a little cozier.

1:24:13.328 --> 1:24:15.328
- Can you help me out here, babe?
- Judy.

1:24:15.330 --> 1:24:16.396
Judy.

1:24:16.398 --> 1:24:18.598
- Judy.
- What? What?

1:24:18.600 --> 1:24:19.834
You can't do this.

1:24:19.836 --> 1:24:21.301
Judy, you can't do this.

1:24:21.303 --> 1:24:22.739
You can't keep me prisoner.

1:24:24.406 --> 1:24:25.474
Get it straight.

1:24:26.508 --> 1:24:28.075
I'm leaving tonight, and
you're coming with me.

1:24:28.077 --> 1:24:30.477
Maybe he's glad that he left me.

1:24:30.479 --> 1:24:31.580
He's not.

1:24:32.481 --> 1:24:35.482
Oh, God, I really don't want...

1:24:35.484 --> 1:24:37.584
When I saw them
naked on that couch...

1:24:37.586 --> 1:24:38.585
He... he is.

1:24:38.587 --> 1:24:40.386
All naked and crawled
up like two white dogs.

1:24:40.388 --> 1:24:41.055
Louise!

1:24:41.057 --> 1:24:42.959
Mom, you're gonna blow it!

1:24:44.026 --> 1:24:45.993
I think I'm blowing it.

1:24:45.995 --> 1:24:48.263
- What are you doing?
- No, you're not.

1:24:48.798 --> 1:24:50.865
I'm sorry!

1:24:50.867 --> 1:24:55.337
Susan and I came to you
because we needed your help.

1:24:55.905 --> 1:25:00.743
Every child wants a
grownup who will pretend

1:25:01.476 --> 1:25:03.713
so I'm gonna tell you
what we're going to do.

1:25:05.480 --> 1:25:10.519
We're going to drive, and then we're going to
fly, and then we're gonna head towards water

1:25:11.854 --> 1:25:21.329
because I see a white sail against
just the most ethereal blue sky.

1:25:23.099 --> 1:25:26.633
Mom, we need to go now
to Judy Small's office.

1:25:26.635 --> 1:25:27.768
Not planned.

1:25:27.770 --> 1:25:30.938
Hands on the wheel
and eyes on the road.

1:25:30.940 --> 1:25:31.806
Thank you.

1:25:31.808 --> 1:25:33.743
I know the fires in need.

1:25:34.609 --> 1:25:35.845
I know the truth.

1:25:36.813 --> 1:25:41.449
I know the truth but
Dr. Kingsley says

1:25:42.417 --> 1:25:45.888
human beings suffer from
reminiscences, Judith.

1:25:46.823 --> 1:25:49.792
You... you suffer from nothing.

1:25:50.827 --> 1:25:54.128
Somewhere there is
a human life for you.

1:25:54.130 --> 1:25:57.630
Judy, I love my wife.

1:25:57.632 --> 1:25:59.334
And yet

1:26:01.137 --> 1:26:03.338
I pretend you love me,

1:26:04.907 --> 1:26:06.709
and you must pretend the same.

1:26:08.811 --> 1:26:10.680
I'm calling 911.

1:26:11.147 --> 1:26:12.048
Come on, baby.

1:26:13.015 --> 1:26:14.382
Coming.

1:26:26.762 --> 1:26:28.595
We should break down the door.

1:26:28.597 --> 1:26:31.832
Yes. We need something.
We need like, um, like a hammer or-

1:26:31.834 --> 1:26:32.766
- Wait, go ask that guy.
- Okay.

1:26:32.768 --> 1:26:33.635
Ask him for help.

1:26:34.569 --> 1:26:35.568
Mom, money.

1:26:35.570 --> 1:26:36.770
You don't need money.

1:26:36.772 --> 1:26:38.504
- Okay.
- Bob!

1:26:38.506 --> 1:26:39.505
Susan!

1:26:39.507 --> 1:26:41.008
Judy!

1:26:41.010 --> 1:26:45.145
- Help!
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up!

1:26:45.147 --> 1:26:47.715
- You need help?
- Yes, he... my husband is in there.

1:26:47.717 --> 1:26:49.515
- You sure he's in there?
- Yes, I'm positive. He's in there.

1:26:49.517 --> 1:26:50.853
- Please, just break the lock.
- Okay. Okay.

1:26:52.788 --> 1:26:54.021
I hear Bob.

1:26:54.023 --> 1:26:55.024
Shhh!

1:26:58.828 --> 1:27:01.130
- Okay, I got it.
- Okay. You stay.

1:27:03.165 --> 1:27:05.799
- Bob!
- Susan!

1:27:05.801 --> 1:27:06.499
Where's Bob?

1:27:06.501 --> 1:27:07.801
Mom! That's Judy. That's Judy.

1:27:07.803 --> 1:27:10.804
Hey, whoa, whoa. Where are you going?
Just relax, lady, okay?

1:27:10.806 --> 1:27:11.872
- Ahh.
- Gah, aw. God.

1:27:11.874 --> 1:27:13.140
Hey, hey, what's going on here?

1:27:13.142 --> 1:27:14.540
Help. Just let me go. Help.

1:27:14.542 --> 1:27:15.575
- Let her go, now.
- No, no, but no...

1:27:15.577 --> 1:27:17.978
What are you doing?
Don't let her go! Get her!

1:27:17.980 --> 1:27:19.547
- She just bit me, man. She's crazy.
- Go!

1:27:21.250 --> 1:27:22.018
Oh, my God.

1:27:27.555 --> 1:27:29.725
I was so scared.

1:27:33.262 --> 1:27:35.729
- I'm sorry.
- Susan, Susan, Susan, my Susan.

1:27:35.731 --> 1:27:36.431
Bob.

1:27:43.773 --> 1:27:45.039
No, stay back.

1:27:45.041 --> 1:27:45.906
I'm gonna jump.

1:27:45.908 --> 1:27:48.208
2546, we need a
jumper squad right away.

1:27:48.210 --> 1:27:49.712
- Hey, look.
- Mom.

1:27:52.048 --> 1:27:52.848
Judy!

1:27:58.721 --> 1:28:00.522
You okay? Yeah.

1:28:01.057 --> 1:28:02.790
Whoa, what are you doing?
You shouldn't be up here.

1:28:02.792 --> 1:28:03.791
- Stand down.
- It's okay.

1:28:03.793 --> 1:28:06.026
I know her. I know her.
It's okay. It's okay.

1:28:06.028 --> 1:28:07.462
She's my therapist.

1:28:10.800 --> 1:28:11.734
Judy.

1:28:12.201 --> 1:28:12.935
Judy.

1:28:14.236 --> 1:28:14.904
Hey.

1:28:17.605 --> 1:28:18.473
Hey, Bob.

1:28:19.041 --> 1:28:20.042
What are you doing?

1:28:23.112 --> 1:28:25.245
Now, come on. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

1:28:25.247 --> 1:28:26.514
This isn't you.

1:28:27.016 --> 1:28:27.717
No, come on.

1:28:28.284 --> 1:28:30.150
Come on, Judy.
You don't do this.

1:28:30.152 --> 1:28:31.887
Judy Small doesn't do this.

1:28:32.855 --> 1:28:33.990
No, you don't.

1:28:37.827 --> 1:28:39.095
Yeah, I've got you.

1:28:39.729 --> 1:28:41.831
Let me help you now. Come on.

1:28:42.732 --> 1:28:43.565
Yeah?

1:28:45.801 --> 1:28:48.037
Okay. Okay. Oh, oh, okay.

1:28:48.704 --> 1:28:50.304
I've got you. I've got you.

1:28:50.306 --> 1:28:51.173
Okay.

1:28:53.575 --> 1:28:54.176
Okay.

1:28:59.614 --> 1:29:00.548
Lover.

1:29:02.084 --> 1:29:02.985
Jewel.

1:29:27.810 --> 1:29:29.178
What are you doing home?

1:29:31.147 --> 1:29:32.580
I have bad news.

1:29:33.315 --> 1:29:34.250
What?

1:29:35.317 --> 1:29:36.285
I got fired.

1:29:38.988 --> 1:29:42.022
How can they fire you?
You have a contract.

1:29:42.024 --> 1:29:45.194
I know. I know. They're gonna buy
me out for 30 cents on the dollar.

1:29:46.128 --> 1:29:47.296
Well, what happened?

1:29:49.398 --> 1:29:52.667
There was this thing with...
with Reed and Walter,

1:29:53.269 --> 1:29:56.336
and I didn't tell you about it because
I wanted to wait until it was done

1:29:56.338 --> 1:29:59.940
so I could come to you and say,
here it is, here's the new deal.

1:29:59.942 --> 1:30:00.974
Here's the big money.

1:30:00.976 --> 1:30:02.311
Here's the new salary.

1:30:03.578 --> 1:30:07.750
And Beaver found out about it,
and told us to pack our bags.

1:30:10.820 --> 1:30:16.356
Look, Susan, I know how bad this
looks, but I'm gonna find another job.

1:30:16.358 --> 1:30:17.659
You don't have to worry.

1:30:20.963 --> 1:30:26.100
You've been fired and we
have no income to speak of,

1:30:26.102 --> 1:30:28.571
and almost no savings.

1:30:34.443 --> 1:30:35.377
But

1:30:39.448 --> 1:30:41.050
at least we have each other.

1:30:43.953 --> 1:30:45.387
Shit.

1:30:51.927 --> 1:30:52.928
Does that hurt?

1:30:53.329 --> 1:30:55.295
Not too much.

1:30:55.297 --> 1:30:57.297
- Good.
- Not anymore.

1:30:57.299 --> 1:30:58.834
Being a tough guy?

1:31:11.247 --> 1:31:14.715
If we hurry we still have time
before Louise gets home.

1:31:14.717 --> 1:31:15.684
Yeah.

1:31:29.832 --> 1:31:30.733
Hello?

1:31:32.234 --> 1:31:34.537
Oh!

1:31:38.407 --> 1:31:41.010
- That's weird.
- Yeah.

1:31:43.245 --> 1:31:44.947
You know what that means?

1:31:46.182 --> 1:31:47.915
Oh, God.

1:31:47.917 --> 1:31:49.318
So gross.

1:31:51.353 --> 1:31:53.487
They barely even
talk to each other.

1:31:53.489 --> 1:31:54.588
Eww.

1:31:54.590 --> 1:31:58.694
Aren't married people
supposed to do it at night?

1:32:02.865 --> 1:32:04.900
- I'm starving.
- Me too.
