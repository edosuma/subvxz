WEBVTT

00:08.479 --> 00:11.042
( into microphone )
 MORNING, GERM SACKS.

00:11.042 --> 00:13.584
I KNOW THAT YOU'VE
ALL BEEN COMPLAINING

00:13.584 --> 00:15.546
THAT THE TECHNOLOGY
AROUND HERE ISN'T QUITE--

00:15.546 --> 00:16.587
( microphone feedback )

00:16.587 --> 00:18.589
(clears throat )
 ISN'T QUITE--

00:18.589 --> 00:20.221
( feedback continues )

00:20.221 --> 00:21.552
( high pitch feedback,
students groan )

00:23.524 --> 00:25.196
STATE OF THE ART.
 ( chuckles )

00:25.196 --> 00:28.059
SO, THANKS TO YOURS TRULY,
WE'RE GETTING

00:28.059 --> 00:30.601
CUTTING-EDGE EQUIPMENT
FOR THE WHOLE SCHOOL TO ENJOY.

00:30.601 --> 00:33.334
JOJO! BETTY!
LET'S GO, LADIES.

00:33.334 --> 00:34.665
WHEEL IT LIKE IT'S HOT.

00:36.307 --> 00:40.811
BEHOLD! MISSION CREEK HIGH'S
BRAND NEW MEDIA CENTER!

00:43.114 --> 00:45.346
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN
CALL IT TECHNOLOGY

00:45.346 --> 00:47.778
IF YOU HAVE TO CHANGE
THE CHANNEL WITH PLIERS.

00:49.220 --> 00:51.482
WHY DO I SMELL
FORMALDEHYDE?

00:51.482 --> 00:55.256
'CAUSE I FOUND IT ON A CURB
OUTSIDE THE MORGUE.

00:55.256 --> 00:58.129
I'M GETTING ALL MY CHRISTMAS
PRESENTS THERE, TOO.

00:58.129 --> 01:00.291
AUNT DOTTY'S GETTIN' SHEETS!

01:01.692 --> 01:03.634
HOW IS THIS THING NEW?

01:03.634 --> 01:05.336
NEW TO YOU, LADY-FACE.

01:08.269 --> 01:09.770
OH, TERRIBLY SORRY
TO TROUBLE YOU,

01:09.770 --> 01:11.672
BUT COULD YOU HELP
ME FIND ME LOCKER?

01:11.672 --> 01:14.375
I-I'M SORRY,
I DON'T SPEAK LEPRECHAUN.

01:16.647 --> 01:18.509
BUT HE IS
FLUENT IN DOOFUS.

01:20.551 --> 01:22.513
OH, YOU'RE
RIGHT THERE AT 324.

01:22.513 --> 01:24.415
BRILLIANT.
 MM-HMM.

01:24.415 --> 01:26.357
OH! I'M ALISTAIR, BY THE WAY.

01:26.357 --> 01:28.159
FOREIGN EXCHANGE STUDENT
FROM IRELAND.

01:28.159 --> 01:29.560
OH. NICE TO MEET YOU,
ALISTAIR. I'M BREE,

01:29.560 --> 01:30.721
AND THIS IS
MY BROTHER ADAM.

01:30.721 --> 01:32.693
I CAN SHOW YOU AROUND,
AND HE...

01:32.693 --> 01:35.696
CAN SHOW YOU HOW TO WARM UP
A SANDWICH IN YOUR ARMPIT.

01:35.696 --> 01:37.368
MMM. BUT I'M WARNING YOU,

01:37.368 --> 01:39.800
THE CHEESE STICKS
ARE GONNA GET MESSY.

01:42.603 --> 01:43.704
WELCOME TO AMERICA.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.136
CHEERS.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.639
WAIT A SECOND.
NEW KID?

01:48.639 --> 01:50.811
FROM A FOREIGN COUNTRY?
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS?

01:50.811 --> 01:53.144
THAT YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WE'LL HAVE TO SPEAK SLOWLY TO?

01:53.144 --> 01:54.245
( sighs )

01:55.446 --> 01:58.219
NO. HE'S A BIONIC SPY.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.221
WELL, THINK ABOUT IT.

02:00.221 --> 02:01.422
MARCUS WAS THE "NEW KID,"

02:01.422 --> 02:02.893
AND LOOK WHAT
HAPPENED WITH HIM.

02:02.893 --> 02:04.625
WE CAN'T TAKE ANY CHANCES.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.358
( sighs ) YOU HOLD HIM DOWN,
I'LL STRIP HIM FOR PARTS.

02:07.358 --> 02:10.401
NO! ADAM,
YOU ARE OVERREACTING.

02:10.401 --> 02:12.563
ALISTAIR SEEMS
LIKE A NICE GUY.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.167
YOU KNOW WHO ALSO
SEEMED LIKE A NICE GUY?

02:16.167 --> 02:17.468
MARCUS!

02:17.468 --> 02:19.570
ALISTAIR'S A BIONIC SPY,
AND I'M GONNA PROVE IT.

02:19.570 --> 02:22.243
EVEN IF I HAVE TO LEARN
HOW TO SPEAK IRELAND-ISH.

02:23.744 --> 02:26.647
OKAY, LET'S FIRE UP
THE MEDIA CENTER!

02:29.580 --> 02:31.522
OKAY, OKAY...

02:31.522 --> 02:32.823
MINOR SETBACK.

02:32.823 --> 02:36.787
FOR THE RECORD, YOU ALL LOOK
MUCH BETTER IN THIS LIGHT.

02:38.589 --> 02:41.632
THE WORLD'S FIRST BIONIC
SUPER-HUMANS.

02:41.632 --> 02:45.536
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US,
FASTER, SMARTER.

02:45.536 --> 02:48.269
THE NEXT GENERATION
OF THE HUMAN RACE IS...

02:48.269 --> 02:50.241
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?

I DON'T HAVE A PAGE 47.

03:34.985 --> 03:38.649
I HAVE A FOUR, A TWELVE,

LISTEN TO THIS.
CHAPTER FOUR,

03:47.928 --> 03:51.502
"HORSE-LESS CARRIAGES TAKING
OVER THE STREETS OF AMERICA."

03:53.564 --> 03:56.707
OTHER SCHOOLS TEACH
ON LAPTOPS AND TABLETS.

03:56.707 --> 03:58.669
WE'RE READING FROM
TEXTBOOKS THAT WARN US

03:58.669 --> 04:00.010
THE BRITISH ARE COMING.

04:01.712 --> 04:03.574
WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING
TO BRING MISSION CREEK HIGH

04:03.574 --> 04:05.276
TO THE 21st CENTURY.

04:05.276 --> 04:06.447
OOH,
MAYBE I CAN HELP.

04:06.447 --> 04:07.578
( Chase and Leo )
NO!

04:07.578 --> 04:11.352
WHAT? I AM A GENIUS TECH MOGUL!

04:11.352 --> 04:13.584
I COULD REVOLUTIONIZE
YOUR WHOLE SCHOOL.

04:13.584 --> 04:14.925
WHY WOULDN'T
YOU WANT ME TO HELP?

04:14.925 --> 04:17.358
BECAUSE EVERY TIME
YOU TRY TO HELP,

04:17.358 --> 04:18.559
IT STARTS IN A GOOD PLACE,

04:18.559 --> 04:21.462
BUT THEN YOUR EGO TAKES OVER
AND RUINS EVERYTHING.

04:21.462 --> 04:24.595
THAT IS NOT TRUE.
GIVE ME ONE EXAMPLE.

04:24.595 --> 04:26.567
LAST WEEK YOU GAVE ME
A NEW BACKPACK.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.439
YOU SAID YOU NEEDED A BACKPACK.

04:28.439 --> 04:30.341
A BACKPACK...

04:30.341 --> 04:31.642
NOT THIS.

04:33.504 --> 04:36.006
ALL THE GUYS
IN THE OFFICE LOVE THEIRS.

04:36.006 --> 04:38.449
TRUST ME, THEY DON'T.

04:40.451 --> 04:41.512
YOU DON'T GET IT.

04:41.512 --> 04:44.315
THIS IS OUR SCHOOL
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

04:44.315 --> 04:45.856
YEAH, WHATEVER DISASTER
YOU CREATE THERE

04:45.856 --> 04:47.918
WILL AFFECT US EVERY DAY.

04:47.918 --> 04:51.662
GUYS, I PROMISE
I WON'T EMBARRASS YOU.

04:51.662 --> 04:54.024
THIS IS ABOUT YOUR SCHOOL,
NOT ABOUT ME.

04:55.596 --> 04:59.069
WELL, OUR SCHOOL COULD
REALLY USE THE HELP...

04:59.069 --> 05:03.374
FINE. BUT YOU KEEP
THAT EGO UNDER CONTROL.

05:03.374 --> 05:07.478
( scoffs ) DON'T WORRY,
MY EGO IS OFFICIALLY CHECKED.

05:07.478 --> 05:10.481

♪ DAVENPORT! DAVENPORT!

05:10.481 --> 05:14.044
♪ SOMEBODY WANTS
TO CALL DAVENPORT! ♪

05:14.044 --> 05:15.986
WHAT? COME ON,
THAT'S JUST CATCHY.

05:23.554 --> 05:25.025
HEY, GUYS! CHECK IT OUT!

05:25.025 --> 05:28.699
ELECTRONIC BULLETIN BOARDS,
TABLETS INSTEAD OF TEXTBOOKS...

05:28.699 --> 05:31.602
AND THIS IS THE COOLEST PART.

05:31.602 --> 05:33.904
CHECK IT OUT.
BY THE END OF TODAY

05:33.904 --> 05:36.507
I WILL HAVE FINGERPRINT
SCANNERS ON ALL THE LOCKERS.

05:36.507 --> 05:37.538
YES!

05:37.538 --> 05:39.009
WE WERE GONNA DO
RETINAL SCANNING,

05:39.009 --> 05:41.442
BUT IT TURNS OUT EYEBALLS
ARE HIGHLY FLAMMABLE.

05:44.575 --> 05:46.076
( beeping )

05:46.076 --> 05:47.077
( automated voice )
 HELLO, LEO DOOLEY.

05:47.077 --> 05:48.819
( chuckles )

05:48.819 --> 05:50.551
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

05:50.551 --> 05:52.553
I THINK IT'S GONNA BE
A LOT HARDER TO GET OUT OF

05:52.553 --> 05:53.854
WHEN SOMEONE LOCKS ME INSIDE.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.355
AH.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.957
I GOTTA HAND IT TO YOU,
MR. DAVENPORT.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.429
THIS IS AMAZING.

05:58.429 --> 06:01.031
SEE? I TOLD YOU
IT WOULD BE GREAT.

06:01.031 --> 06:03.864
( robotic sounds )

06:03.864 --> 06:07.067
OH, AND I SEE YOU GAVE
PRINCIPAL PERRY A MAKEOVER.

06:07.067 --> 06:09.570
I ESPECIALLY LOVE
WHAT YOU DID TO HER FACE.

06:09.570 --> 06:12.543
ZIP IT, DOOLEY.

06:12.543 --> 06:14.605
THAT'S NOT PRINCIPAL PERRY.

06:14.605 --> 06:16.376
THAT'S ROBO PERRY.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.678
SHE'S A ROBOT!

06:17.678 --> 06:19.750
AND SHE'S BEAUTIFUL!

06:25.155 --> 06:26.457
MAKE IT STOP!

06:26.457 --> 06:27.858
OH.

06:29.059 --> 06:31.492
( sighs )
ANYWAY, I DESIGNED ROBO PERRY

06:31.492 --> 06:33.624
SO SHE COULD ROAM THE HALLS,
HANDING OUT DETENTIONS WHILE--

06:33.624 --> 06:35.766
I'M ON A THREE-HOUR
LUNCH BREAK!

06:36.767 --> 06:38.829
OR LURKING ELSEWHERE.

06:41.502 --> 06:42.773
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?

06:42.773 --> 06:43.874
SIMPLE.

06:43.874 --> 06:45.576
I, UH, TOOK
THE FOUNDATIONS OF A ROBOT

06:45.576 --> 06:48.439
I BUILT FOR PRIVATE SECURITY
AND I REPURPOSED THE SOFTWARE.

06:48.439 --> 06:50.180
AND THEN, OF COURSE,
I MATCHED HER VOCAL PATTERN.

06:50.180 --> 06:51.812
IT WASN'T EASY
MATCHING THE SOUNDS

06:51.812 --> 06:53.914
OF A GRAVEL TRUCK UNLOADING
WITH A BEAR IN LABOR,

06:53.914 --> 06:55.085
BUT I GOT IT.

06:57.448 --> 06:59.850
I ALWAYS WANTED
A SUPER CUTE TWIN SISTER.

06:59.850 --> 07:02.593
( gasps ) I'M GONNA BUY
US MATCHING BIKINIS.

07:04.595 --> 07:07.658
AND I'M GONNA GOUGE
MY EYES OUT.

07:07.658 --> 07:09.500
Both:
SHUT IT, DOOLEY!

07:11.902 --> 07:13.063
THANKS, DON!

07:13.063 --> 07:15.606
H-HEY-- YEAH,
YOU'RE WELCOME. YEAH.

07:17.568 --> 07:19.510
WHY WOULD YOU
MAKE ANOTHER PERRY?

07:19.510 --> 07:21.712
PRINCIPAL PERRY SAID
IF I MAKE HER LIFE EASIER,

07:21.712 --> 07:25.045
SHE'S GONNA NAME A WING
OF THE SCHOOL AFTER ME.

07:25.045 --> 07:28.078
YOU SOLD US OUT JUST TO HAVE
YOUR NAME ABOVE A DOORWAY?

07:28.078 --> 07:31.552
ONCE AGAIN, YOUR EGO TAKES
OVER AND RUINS EVERYTHING.

07:31.552 --> 07:36.086
HEY. IF MY NAME ON THIS SCHOOL
BRINGS MORE PRESTIGE AND FUNDING

07:36.086 --> 07:39.229
BECAUSE I'M SO AWESOME,
THAT'S A WIN-WIN-WIN.

07:39.229 --> 07:42.533
THAT'S THREE WINS!
THAT'S A DAVEN-WIN!

07:46.867 --> 07:48.639
OH, HEY, ADAM.
TOSS ME MY WATER BOTTLE.

07:51.942 --> 07:52.943
WOW!

07:52.943 --> 07:55.475
I BELIEVE THIS IS YOURS.

07:57.708 --> 07:59.479
HOW'D YOU GRAB THAT SO FAST?

07:59.479 --> 08:02.482
YEAH!
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?

08:02.482 --> 08:04.855
MUST BE ME QUICK REFLEXES.

08:04.855 --> 08:07.658
( mouthing )

08:07.658 --> 08:09.690
OR MAYBE IT'S JUST
THE LUCK OF THE IRISH!

08:11.161 --> 08:13.123
NO? NOT--NOT
DIGGING THE IRISH?

08:13.123 --> 08:14.625
I, I CAN DO AMERICAN?

08:14.625 --> 08:15.996
(in American accent )
I LIKE PICK-UP TRUCKS,

08:15.996 --> 08:18.168
SPRING BREAK,
AND EXTRA-LARGE PORTIONS.

08:18.168 --> 08:20.030
YEE-HAW!

08:20.030 --> 08:22.603
W-WAIT, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR ACCENT?

08:22.603 --> 08:23.604
PRETTY COOL, HUH?

08:23.604 --> 08:25.536
IT'S ONE OF ME
SPECIAL ABILITIES.

08:25.536 --> 08:27.277
I CAN SOUND LIKE
ALMOST ANYBODY.

08:27.277 --> 08:29.610
FRENCH, GERMAN. RUSSIAN!

08:29.610 --> 08:32.813
(in Russian accent)
IT IS A PLEASURE
TO BE IN YOUR COUNTRY.

08:33.813 --> 08:37.147
WOW. THAT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.

08:37.147 --> 08:39.188
( New York accent )
THERE'S PLENTY MORE WHERE
THAT CAME FROM, SWEETHEART.

08:39.188 --> 08:42.653
HEY, SOME DAY,
AND THAT DAY MAY NEVER COME,

08:42.653 --> 08:45.926
MAYBE YOU'LL DO
AN IMPRESSION FOR ME, YEAH?

08:50.230 --> 08:53.604
DID YOU HEAR THAT?
HE SAID "SPECIAL ABILITIES."

08:53.604 --> 08:54.605
I KNOW.

08:54.605 --> 08:55.606
AND THAT ACCENT THING

08:55.606 --> 08:57.568
WAS JUST LIKE
MY VOCAL MANIPULATION!

08:57.568 --> 08:59.009
YEAH!
( sighs )

08:59.009 --> 09:01.541
BUT YOUR OLD ITALIAN GUY'S
WAY BETTER THAN HIS.

09:04.144 --> 09:05.545
KEEP IT UP, CHIP PARKER,

09:05.545 --> 09:07.648
AND YOU WILL BE
IN DETENTION FOREVER YOU--

09:07.648 --> 09:09.980
SEARCHING-DATABASE-
FOR-INSULT...

09:09.980 --> 09:11.021
MOUTH-BREATHER.

09:13.624 --> 09:16.627
GREAT. EVERYBODY
AT SCHOOL HATES US.

09:16.627 --> 09:18.288
YEAH, BUT NOW IT'S
HIGH-TECH HATE.

09:18.288 --> 09:22.192
HEY, HOW COME YOU GUYS AREN'T
EATING IN THE DAVENPORTERIA?

09:22.192 --> 09:24.164
FUNNY THING.

09:24.164 --> 09:27.738
WHEN YOUR DAD CREATES
AN EVEN WORSE VERSION
OF THE WORST PRINCIPAL EVER,

09:27.738 --> 09:29.269
KIDS TEND TO TURN ON YOU.

09:33.203 --> 09:34.304
LOOK, DON'T WORRY.

09:34.304 --> 09:36.006
I'M SURE THIS WILL
ALL BLOW OVER

09:36.006 --> 09:38.348
ONCE KIDS GET
USED TO ROBO PERRY.

09:38.348 --> 09:39.610
REMEMBER WHEN
YOU FIRST MET LEO?

09:39.610 --> 09:41.111
YOU COULDN'T STAND HIM.

09:45.285 --> 09:46.657
DONNY D.!

09:46.657 --> 09:49.319
PRINCIPAL P.!

09:49.319 --> 09:52.362
OH! BOO!

09:52.362 --> 09:53.724
OLD PEOPLE.

09:53.724 --> 09:55.095
YOU DON'T THINK YOU ARE,
BUT YOU ARE.

09:56.326 --> 09:58.268
YOU ARE A GENIUS.

09:58.268 --> 10:01.331
AND YOU ARE A MASTER
OF THE OBVIOUS.

10:01.331 --> 10:02.673
( both laughing )

10:02.673 --> 10:03.774
CHEERS!
 ( sighs )

10:03.774 --> 10:06.136
ROBO PERRY IS AMAZING.

10:06.136 --> 10:08.208
I KNOW IT'S ONLY BEEN
A FEW DAYS BUT--

10:08.208 --> 10:10.681
( inhales )
DO YOU SMELL THAT?

10:10.681 --> 10:13.113
( sniffing )
MOIST CAT FOOD?

10:13.113 --> 10:16.016
I WAS RUNNING LATE,
I GRABBED A CAN.

10:16.016 --> 10:18.248
I THOUGHT IT WAS TUNA!
LIVE WITH IT!

10:20.390 --> 10:23.153
FEAR. IT'S FEAR.

10:23.153 --> 10:24.655
AND IT'S EVERYWHERE.

10:24.655 --> 10:27.627
IT'S THE BEST SMELL
IN THE WORLD.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.661
I PREFER CRISPLY-MINTED
HUNDREDS,

10:30.661 --> 10:33.864
BUT WHATEVER FLOATS
YOUR BOAT, PERRY BOMB.

10:33.864 --> 10:35.836
LISTEN, I WAS TELLING
THE SUPERINTENDENT

10:35.836 --> 10:38.168
HOW WONDERFUL
ROBO PERRY IS,

10:38.168 --> 10:40.911
AND HE'S BRINGING THE ENTIRE
SCHOOL BOARD BY THIS AFTERNOON

10:40.911 --> 10:42.242
TO CHECK HER OUT.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.815
SOON, IF WE'RE LUCKY,
THERE'LL BE A ROBO PERRY

10:44.815 --> 10:46.316
IN EVERY SCHOOL
IN THE DISTRICT.

10:47.878 --> 10:51.952
AND, AFTER THAT,
EVERY SCHOOL IN AMERICA!

10:51.952 --> 10:53.323
( chuckles )
 OH-HO-HO!

10:53.323 --> 10:55.255
GREAT. NOW KIDS WE'VE
NEVER MET WILL HATE US.

10:56.386 --> 11:00.030
DONALD DAVENPORT,
THE CHILDREN'S SAVIOR.

11:00.030 --> 11:02.332
I'M GONNA MAKE
SO MUCH MONEY.

11:02.332 --> 11:03.333
( both laughing )

11:03.333 --> 11:04.364
AND AS YOUR PARTNER,

11:04.364 --> 11:06.396
I'LL BE HAPPY
TO GIVE YOU 30%.

11:06.396 --> 11:10.100
WELL, I THINK YOU'RE
FORGETTING WHO CREATED
THIS WORK OF GENIUS.

11:10.100 --> 11:13.043
WELL, I THINK YOU'RE
FORGETTING WHO'S PUTTING
THE DEAL TOGETHER.

11:13.043 --> 11:14.745
HMM.

11:14.745 --> 11:16.376
WHY DON'T WE GO DISCUSS
THIS IN MY OFFICE?

11:16.376 --> 11:19.249
I THINK A LOT MORE CLEARLY
IN MY BUTT-MASSAGING CHAIR.

11:20.711 --> 11:23.213
I'M SORRY, I BLACKED OUT
AFTER THE WORD "CHAIR."

11:28.688 --> 11:30.420
OKAY. BEFORE WE DO
ANYTHING DRASTIC,

11:30.420 --> 11:32.392
WE NEED PROOF THAT
ALISTAIR'S A BIONIC SPY.

11:32.392 --> 11:33.693
RIGHT.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.095
GO INTO MISSION MODE.

11:37.027 --> 11:39.299
OKAY, I'LL INTERROGATE HIM
AND SEE IF HE SLIPS UP,

11:39.299 --> 11:42.332
BUT WE HAVE TO BE SUBTLE.
SO, LET ME HANDLE THIS.

11:42.332 --> 11:45.275
RIGHT.
GO INTO SUBTLE MODE.

11:47.738 --> 11:49.379
SO, ALISTAIR.

11:49.379 --> 11:50.841
WHAT BRINGS YOU TO AMERICA?

11:50.841 --> 11:53.713
WELL, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY
AND THE PEOPLE ARE--

11:55.986 --> 11:57.017
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:57.017 --> 11:58.418
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:58.418 --> 12:01.121
JUST HAVING A LITTLE LUNCH.

12:01.121 --> 12:03.123
YOU KNOW, RECHARGING
ME BATTERIES.

12:03.123 --> 12:05.455
OH, SO YOU RUN ON BATTERIES NOW?

12:05.455 --> 12:07.798
WHAT'S YOUR GAME, MISTER?

12:07.798 --> 12:10.500
MAYBE I SHOULD
JUST TAKE ME CHIPS AND GO.

12:10.500 --> 12:13.003
CHIPS, HUH?
AND WHAT CHIPS WOULD THOSE BE?

12:13.003 --> 12:14.104
THE BIONIC CHIP IN YOUR HEAD?

12:14.104 --> 12:15.335
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
ARE YOU SCARED?

12:15.335 --> 12:17.307
YOU SHOULD BE,
'CAUSE WE'RE ONTO YOU!

12:20.340 --> 12:22.342
BE HONEST,
WAS THAT TOO SUBTLE?

12:30.981 --> 12:32.122
( sighs )

12:32.122 --> 12:34.054
OKAY, COAST IS CLEAR,
EVERYONE'S IN CLASS,

12:34.054 --> 12:35.325
AND ROBO PERRY IS CHARGING.

12:35.325 --> 12:36.486
I JUST NEED TO FIND OUT

12:36.486 --> 12:39.029
WHERE MR. DAVENPORT
PUT HER CONTROL PANEL.

12:47.397 --> 12:50.871
HUNDREDS, HUNDREDS
OF PLACES TO CHOOSE FROM

12:50.871 --> 12:53.373
AND HE PUTS IT THERE.

12:56.346 --> 12:57.447
HAVE FUN.

13:01.982 --> 13:04.354
SHE'S A ROBOT.
HOW DOES SHE SWEAT?

13:10.520 --> 13:13.163
( sighs )
THERE WE GO.

13:13.163 --> 13:15.465
INSTEAD OF SEEING ROBO PERRY
PATROLLING THE HALLS,

13:15.465 --> 13:18.829
THE SCHOOL BOARD
WILL SEE THIS...

13:22.132 --> 13:23.333
( music plays )

13:30.510 --> 13:31.842
( Davenport screams )

13:32.883 --> 13:34.144
WHAT DID YOU GUYS DO TO HER?

13:34.144 --> 13:37.247
TAPPED INTO HER CONTROL PANEL
AND ADJUSTED THE SETTINGS.

13:37.247 --> 13:40.090
YOU MESSED WITH US,
NOW IT'S PAYBACK TIME.

13:40.090 --> 13:44.454
N-NO--NO! ROBO PERRY'S
ORIGINAL PROGRAMMING
WAS FOR MILITARY PATROL.

13:44.454 --> 13:46.526
IF ANY UNAUTHORIZED
USER TAMPERS WITH IT,

13:46.526 --> 13:48.598
IT RESETS TO ITS
FACTORY DEFAULT.

13:48.598 --> 13:52.032
SO RESET HER DATE AND TIME.
BIG DEAL.

13:52.032 --> 13:56.436
THE FACTORY DEFAULT IS,
"SEARCH AND DESTROY."

13:56.436 --> 14:00.110
NOW IT'S LOCKED IN
AND I CAN'T STOP IT!

14:00.110 --> 14:01.511
THREAT DETECTED.

14:01.511 --> 14:03.373
AHH!
 DESTROY.

14:03.373 --> 14:05.015
AHH!

14:05.015 --> 14:06.276
( crashing sound )

14:06.276 --> 14:08.418
NOW, THAT'S WHAT
YOU CALL A DAVEN-SPLAT.

14:16.486 --> 14:19.930
OUT OF MY WAY,
SPACE-WASTERS.

14:19.930 --> 14:22.592
WE'VE GOT TO STOP HER BEFORE
SHE DESTROYS THE WHOLE SCHOOL.

14:22.592 --> 14:24.895
I THINK WE CAN
DIVERT HER ATTENTION

14:24.895 --> 14:27.197
AND LURE HER INTO
THAT EMPTY CLASSROOM.

14:27.197 --> 14:29.139
WE JUST NEED SOME BAIT.

14:35.175 --> 14:36.546
ME? WHY ME?

14:36.546 --> 14:39.879
WELL, BECAUSE YOU'RE...

14:39.879 --> 14:40.981
YOU ARE...

14:40.981 --> 14:41.982
BRAVE?

14:41.982 --> 14:43.183
Both:
BRAVE.

14:43.183 --> 14:44.514
HMM?
 YEP.

14:44.514 --> 14:47.988
ALL RIGHT, I'LL DO IT.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.161
( softly )
Hey, Robo Perry, over--

14:51.161 --> 14:53.093
OH, GET OVER THERE!

14:55.665 --> 14:58.228
HEY, OVER HERE,
BUDS AND BOLTS!

15:00.030 --> 15:02.232
TINY THREAT DETECTED.

15:02.232 --> 15:06.306
OKAY, I AM TOO BIG TO BE TINY,
AND TOO TINY TO BE A THREAT.

15:07.477 --> 15:08.538
AHH!

15:08.538 --> 15:10.280
( indistinct yelling )

15:11.281 --> 15:12.382
( Leo yells, loud bang )

15:12.382 --> 15:14.314
OOH!
 ( Leo yells )

15:14.314 --> 15:16.086
( both groan,
Leo screams )

15:16.086 --> 15:17.417
AIM FOR THE BOLTS!

15:19.489 --> 15:21.021
( grunts, panting )

15:23.623 --> 15:25.195
LEO, ARE YOU OKAY?

15:25.195 --> 15:29.699
BOYS, I'VE SEEN SOME THINGS.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.365
SINCE YOUR "SUBTLE"
INTERROGATION FAILED,

15:35.365 --> 15:38.108
I THINK IT'S TIME WE TRY
A DIFFERENT TACTIC.

15:38.108 --> 15:40.440
OR WE COULD DO EXACTLY
WHAT WE DID BEFORE

15:40.440 --> 15:41.972
AND HOPE FOR
A DIFFERENT RESULT.

15:41.972 --> 15:47.017
NO, I'M TALKING ABOUT
A FRIENDLY GAME OF DODGEBALL.

15:47.017 --> 15:48.118
OH.

15:48.118 --> 15:49.679
IF ALISTAIR IS BIONIC,

15:49.679 --> 15:52.622
HIS INSTINCTIVE REFLEXES
WILL AUTOMATICALLY KICK IN.

15:52.622 --> 15:54.024
OKAY. BUT IF IT DOESN'T WORK,

15:54.024 --> 15:57.057
HE AND I ARE GONNA PLAY
A LITTLE GAME CALLED
TRUTH OR WEDGIE.

15:59.029 --> 16:00.360
HEY, ALISTAIR!

16:00.360 --> 16:01.561
OH, HELLO, GUYS.

16:01.561 --> 16:02.632
BREE AND I WANT
TO INTRODUCE YOU

16:02.632 --> 16:04.664
TO A GREAT AMERICAN GAME
CALLED DODGEBALL.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.736
OH, THAT SOUNDS LOVELY.
HOW DO YOU...

16:06.736 --> 16:08.638
( grunts )

16:08.638 --> 16:09.699
PLAY?

16:09.699 --> 16:11.001
( groans )

16:11.001 --> 16:13.103
YOU'RE DOING GREAT,
BUDDY!

16:13.103 --> 16:15.545
HEY, ADAM. THOSE DON'T
LOOK LIKE BIONIC REFLEXES.

16:15.545 --> 16:17.007
OH, BUT THAT'S BECAUSE
HE KNOWS WE SUSPECT HIM,

16:17.007 --> 16:19.049
SO HE'S HIDING THEM.
THIS GUY IS GOOD.

16:21.311 --> 16:22.352
AHH!

16:26.486 --> 16:28.318
YOU KNOW, IT'S A GOOD THING
THIS GUY IS BIONIC,

16:28.318 --> 16:29.689
OR THIS WOULD REALLY HURT.

16:29.689 --> 16:30.690
OH!

16:33.763 --> 16:35.425
HOW COULD YOU GUYS
DO THIS TO ME?

16:35.425 --> 16:37.267
WE HAD TO.
YOU DOUBLED THE PERRY,

16:37.267 --> 16:38.628
WHICH DOUBLED OUR PAIN!

16:38.628 --> 16:41.171
PAIN? YOU DON'T KNOW PAIN!

16:41.171 --> 16:44.504
I AM A DAMAGED LITTLE BOY.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.676
( robotic sounds )

16:46.676 --> 16:48.308
LOOK, MAYBE
YOU GUYS ARE RIGHT.

16:48.308 --> 16:52.282
FROM NOW ON, I WILL NOT LET
MY EGO GET THE BETTER OF ME.

16:52.282 --> 16:53.613
WHICH SHOULDN'T BE HARD,

16:53.613 --> 16:56.316
BECAUSE I AM SO AWESOME
AT EVERYTHING.

16:56.316 --> 16:57.617
HERE'S WHERE I WORK
WITH MY STUDENTS...

16:57.617 --> 16:59.319
OH, GREAT.
THE SCHOOL BOARD.

16:59.319 --> 17:02.052
THIS DEMONSTRATION WILL SHOW
THAT MISSION CREEK HIGH

17:02.052 --> 17:03.493
IS THE SCHOOL OF THE FUTURE.

17:03.493 --> 17:07.527
AND THERE'S THE MAN WHO'S
30% RESPONSIBLE FOR IT,

17:07.527 --> 17:08.728
DONALD DAVENPORT.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.530
( chuckling )
PRINCIPAL PERRY!

17:10.530 --> 17:12.462
WHAT'S THE WORD, DONNY BIRD?

17:12.462 --> 17:13.463
( both laughing )

17:13.463 --> 17:15.234
UH, WHERE'S ROBO ME?

17:15.234 --> 17:18.738
UH, SHE IS, UH, SUPERVISING
A PARENT-TEACHER CONFERENCE.

17:18.738 --> 17:19.739
OH.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.641
( loud banging )

17:21.641 --> 17:22.712
IT'S NOT GOING WELL.

17:23.772 --> 17:25.714
WELL, GET THAT BEAUTIFUL HUNK
OF METAL OUT HERE.

17:25.714 --> 17:27.176
I WANT TO SHOW HER OFF.

17:27.176 --> 17:28.718
OH, WHY DON'T WE
JUST STAY OUT HERE

17:28.718 --> 17:32.282
AND LOOK AT THAT BIG,
BEAUTIFUL HUNK OF... YOU?

17:32.282 --> 17:33.383
( Robo Perry grunts )

17:33.383 --> 17:34.384
AHH!

17:36.556 --> 17:40.330
THERE SHE IS!
COME GIVE YOUR SISSY A KISSY.

17:40.330 --> 17:42.232
THREAT DETECTED.

17:42.232 --> 17:43.633
THREAT? I'M NO THREAT.

17:43.633 --> 17:44.694
WHAT ARE YOU--
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

17:44.694 --> 17:47.337
DESTROY! DESTROY!

17:47.337 --> 17:50.470
DESTROY ME?
OH, HONEY, MANY HAVE TRIED.

17:50.470 --> 17:51.701
I DON'T THINK SO.

17:51.701 --> 17:53.843
( grunting )

17:55.545 --> 17:57.447
ALL RIGHT, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON,

17:57.447 --> 18:00.250
BUT YOU ARE GOING DOWN,
METAL ME!

18:00.250 --> 18:03.153
NO, YOU ARE GOING DOWN,
FLESHY ME.

18:03.153 --> 18:04.584
( Perry screams )

18:06.516 --> 18:08.688
WE'RE NOT GETTING
MUCH OF AN EDUCATION,

18:08.688 --> 18:10.620
BUT WHERE ELSE
CAN YOU SEE THIS?

18:13.723 --> 18:16.196
WE'VE BEEN TORTURING
THIS KID ALL DAY.

18:16.196 --> 18:17.697
MAYBE HE'S NOT BIONIC.

18:17.697 --> 18:20.630
OH, BREE,
THIS IS AMERICA.

18:20.630 --> 18:23.373
HE IS GUILTY UNTIL
PROVEN INNOCENT.

18:24.634 --> 18:26.276
ONE LAST TEST.

18:27.407 --> 18:29.479
ALISTAIR! BUDDY!

18:29.479 --> 18:31.181
YOU WANNA HANG WITH BREE AND ME?

18:31.181 --> 18:32.442
IT'LL BE FUN.

18:32.442 --> 18:33.713
YOU KNOW, MAYBE
IT'S A CULTURAL THING,

18:33.713 --> 18:35.815
BUT MY IDEA OF FUN INVOLVES
A LOT FEWER BRUISES.

18:35.815 --> 18:38.718
OH, ALLY.

18:38.718 --> 18:41.891
LOOK, IF YOU DON'T WANT
PEOPLE TO STOP PICKING ON YOU,

18:41.891 --> 18:44.194
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
PUMP SOME IRON.

18:44.194 --> 18:45.455
OH, NO, I'M GOOD, REA--

18:45.455 --> 18:46.696
NO, I REALLY
THINK YOU SHOULD.

18:46.696 --> 18:47.727
NO. TO BE HONEST,

18:47.727 --> 18:48.728
I'M NOT MUCH
OF A WEIGHTLIFTER.

18:48.728 --> 18:50.160
OH, COME ON!
YOU CAN DO IT.

18:50.160 --> 18:51.461
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I GOT SOME STUDYING TO DO,

18:51.461 --> 18:52.462
AND I REALLY SHOULD JUST BE--

18:52.462 --> 18:54.604
STOP ARGUING WITH ME
AND JUST DO IT!

18:55.605 --> 18:56.706
( high-pitched scream )

18:59.639 --> 19:00.710
ADAM?

19:00.710 --> 19:02.412
WHAT?

19:02.412 --> 19:04.744
OH!

19:04.744 --> 19:06.376
DO YOU THINK HE SAW?

19:11.721 --> 19:13.553
DON! WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:13.553 --> 19:15.355
I DON'T THINK I CAN
HOLD HER MUCH LONGER.

19:15.355 --> 19:16.656
SHE'S STRONG.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.928
YOU MUST HAVE GIVEN HER SOME
OF MY UNBRIDLED RAGE.

19:18.928 --> 19:20.530
AHH!

19:20.530 --> 19:22.232
( loud crash )

19:22.232 --> 19:24.394
CAREFUL.

19:24.394 --> 19:26.466
PRINCIPAL PERRY!

19:26.466 --> 19:27.767
PRINCIPAL PERRY,
YOU HAVE TO HELP ME!

19:27.767 --> 19:29.199
ADAM AND--
( gasps, screams )

19:33.172 --> 19:34.274
( groaning )

19:34.274 --> 19:37.647
OH! NOW, SHE KNOWS
HOW TO LIFT.

19:37.647 --> 19:44.714
I SEE STARS AND YELLOW MOONS
AND GREEN CLOVERS.

19:46.286 --> 19:48.318
WELL, THAT SETTLES THAT.

19:48.318 --> 19:50.390
HE'S DEFINITELY NOT BIONIC.

19:50.390 --> 19:53.192
YEP. BUT "LEPRECHAUN"
IS STILL ON THE TABLE.

19:54.724 --> 19:57.467
MR. DAVENPORT, HOW ARE WE
GONNA STOP ROBO PERRY?

19:57.467 --> 19:59.769
WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO USE YOUR BIONICS.

19:59.769 --> 20:02.532
YOU WANT US TO EXPOSE OURSELVES
IN FRONT OF THE SCHOOL BOARD?

20:02.532 --> 20:05.405
NO, HE WANTS US TO USE
OUR BIONICS IN FRONT
OF THE SCHOOL BOARD.

20:05.405 --> 20:07.337
THIS GUY!

20:07.337 --> 20:09.739
NO. LOOK, WE HAVE
TO DO SOMETHING!

20:09.739 --> 20:11.641
ROBO PERRY IS GONNA
DESTROY THE ENTIRE SCHOOL!

20:11.641 --> 20:12.982
JUST DO IT!

20:19.989 --> 20:22.422
AHH!

20:23.853 --> 20:24.994
Adam:
OH!

20:28.758 --> 20:31.361
THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE!

20:33.633 --> 20:34.804
STILL ONE TOO MANY.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.615
HEY, ALISTAIR.

20:45.615 --> 20:48.718
UH, LOOK, ABOUT YESTERDAY,
WITH THE WEIGHT RACK--

20:48.718 --> 20:51.351
TO BE HONEST, I CAN'T REALLY
REMEMBER MUCH ABOUT YESTERDAY.

20:51.351 --> 20:52.782
WH-- YOU CAN'T?

20:52.782 --> 20:55.425
NO. I KNOCKED ME NOGGIN SOMEHOW.

20:55.425 --> 20:58.458
EVERYTHING AFTER
DODGEBALL'S JUST A BLUR.

20:59.659 --> 21:00.890
SPEAKING OF DODGEBALL...

21:00.890 --> 21:01.961
I'VE BEEN PRACTICING.

21:01.961 --> 21:03.533
I EVEN PUT A TEAM TOGETHER.

21:03.533 --> 21:04.734
ALL FOREIGN EXCHANGE STUDENTS.

21:04.734 --> 21:05.735
Bree: OH.

21:07.667 --> 21:11.000
LADS, LASSES,
SHOW 'EM WHAT YOU GOT.

21:16.005 --> 21:17.677
AS YOU AMERICANS LIKE TO SAY...

21:17.677 --> 21:20.009
( American accent )
YOU JUST GOT SCHOOLED, PLAYAS!

21:20.009 --> 21:21.481
HOLLA!
