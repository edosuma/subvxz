00:02.003 --> 00:04.494
Previously on Lost:

00:10.219 --> 00:12.961
- Is that Benjamin Linus?
- We need you to save his life.

00:13.097 --> 00:16.760
If I take him,
he's not ever gonna be the same.

00:16.851 --> 00:18.387
He will always be one of us.

00:18.769 --> 00:22.512
Get your ass out here right now...
or I'm gonna kill your daughter.

00:22.607 --> 00:26.600
I stole her as a baby from an insane
woman. She means nothing to me.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.480
So if you wanna kill her,
go ahead and...

00:29.655 --> 00:30.986
This guy is dangerous.

00:31.282 --> 00:36.322
Boat I came on was filled with commandos
whose mission was to get him.

00:36.412 --> 00:38.277
How'd that work out for everyone?

00:41.709 --> 00:44.075
- You know him?
- Yeah.

00:46.464 --> 00:48.546
He's the man who killed me.

01:14.617 --> 01:16.403
- What have you done?
- Calm down.

01:16.494 --> 01:18.906
- This has nothing to do with you.
- It's true?

01:18.996 --> 01:22.159
- You brought one of them to our Temple?
- He's a boy. He was dying.

01:22.291 --> 01:25.954
- Then you should have let him die.
- Jacob wanted it done.

01:29.006 --> 01:32.169
The island chooses who
the island chooses. You know that.

01:35.680 --> 01:37.762
Yes. Yes, of course.

01:40.017 --> 01:41.678
What's his name?

02:01.539 --> 02:02.619
Hello, Benjamin.

02:04.542 --> 02:06.203
What happened?

02:07.211 --> 02:09.042
You were injured.

02:10.423 --> 02:13.381
- How?
- You don't remember?

02:14.844 --> 02:17.426
Where am |?

02:17.513 --> 02:19.879
You're among friends.

02:19.974 --> 02:23.558
- And we're going to take care of you.
- My dad, is he here?

02:24.687 --> 02:28.225
- You'll be back to him soon enough.
- No, I don't want to go...

02:29.066 --> 02:31.057
- OK. Easy, easy.
- No...

02:32.737 --> 02:34.568
I don't want to go back.

02:36.407 --> 02:37.567
I want to stay.

02:40.328 --> 02:42.068
I want to be one of you.

02:42.955 --> 02:47.574
Just because you're living with them
doesn't mean you can't be one of us.

02:48.127 --> 02:49.958
You should be dead, Benjamin.

02:50.046 --> 02:52.082
But this island...

02:53.049 --> 02:55.131
...it saved your life.

02:57.011 --> 02:59.502
Who are you?

02:59.597 --> 03:01.133
l'm Charles.

03:02.892 --> 03:04.428
Charles Widmore.

03:11.108 --> 03:12.689
Ben.

03:22.119 --> 03:23.575
Hello, Ben.

03:25.456 --> 03:27.663
Welcome back to the land of the living.

03:30.294 --> 03:32.159
My God.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.873
- You're alive!
- Yes, I am.

03:39.804 --> 03:43.547
I knew it.
I knew that this would happen.

03:45.851 --> 03:48.058
Then why are you
so surprised to see me?

03:49.855 --> 03:52.517
Because it's one thing
to believe it, John...

03:54.068 --> 03:56.354
...it's another thing to see it.

03:56.445 --> 03:59.312
Then why were you trying
to run away to the main island?

04:01.325 --> 04:03.907
I broke the rules, John.

04:03.994 --> 04:06.827
I came back to the island.

04:07.415 --> 04:11.328
l was going to answer for
what I've done. I was going back...

04:13.504 --> 04:15.244
...to be judged.

04:19.051 --> 04:21.292
Judged?

04:24.014 --> 04:25.720
By whom?

04:26.350 --> 04:30.138
Well, John, we don't
even have a word for it.

04:31.981 --> 04:34.518
But I believe you call it "the monster."

05:05.556 --> 05:07.592
- Morning.
- Hello.

05:08.726 --> 05:12.310
- What's in the crate?
- Just some stuff we need to get moved.

05:13.147 --> 05:16.605
- Need a hand?
- Thanks. We got it.

05:18.736 --> 05:20.601
OK. Have a great day.

05:33.876 --> 05:35.707
How are you feeling, my friend?

05:35.794 --> 05:39.036
Like someone hit me with an oar.
But I'll live.

05:41.050 --> 05:43.757
- What do you make of him?
- I'm not sure.

05:46.055 --> 05:47.295
What has he told you?

05:47.389 --> 05:50.927
When you were out cold
he was watching over you.

05:53.103 --> 05:55.890
- And he said you killed him.
- I killed him?!

05:57.816 --> 05:59.522
Really? He looks fine to me.

06:06.951 --> 06:10.660
You know, I don't really
remember him from the plane.

06:10.788 --> 06:12.653
- Do you?
- No. I don't.

06:16.585 --> 06:18.576
What if...

06:18.671 --> 06:22.129
...he was already here
before we crashed?

06:22.216 --> 06:25.128
If he thinks I killed him,
then he's insane.

06:25.261 --> 06:28.378
We may be dealing with a man
who is dangerously deranged.

06:28.472 --> 06:31.839
Then, the question is,
what are we going to do about him?

06:32.643 --> 06:34.304
Don't worry, my friend...

06:38.899 --> 06:40.560
l have your back.

06:43.153 --> 06:44.939
Caesar.

06:45.030 --> 06:47.487
Pleasure to meet you, Caesar. l'm Ben.

07:06.677 --> 07:08.668
Do you want me to do it?

07:11.307 --> 07:13.548
I can do it if you want me to, Ben.

07:13.684 --> 07:18.144
Shut up and stay here, Ethan.

07:54.850 --> 07:56.511
Don't do it!

08:00.564 --> 08:03.055
You're the one
who infected us, aren't you?!

08:10.616 --> 08:12.152
No... no!

08:16.413 --> 08:18.904
It's OK.

08:23.587 --> 08:26.249
Please... don't take my Alex!

08:27.841 --> 08:30.878
- Do you want your baby to live?
- Why are you taking her?

08:33.847 --> 08:36.259
Be grateful you're still alive!

08:37.267 --> 08:38.928
Now you listen to me...

08:39.770 --> 08:44.560
If you try to follow me or if you
ever come looking for me, I'll kill you.

08:44.650 --> 08:46.686
And, if you want your child to live,

08:46.777 --> 08:49.940
every time you hear whispers,
you run the other way.

09:21.103 --> 09:22.718
What's that?

09:24.982 --> 09:27.064
Just something sentimental.

09:36.118 --> 09:37.983
So this is your old office?

09:41.665 --> 09:45.157
I never pictured you leading
your people from... behind a desk.

09:46.128 --> 09:47.413
Seems a little...

09:49.339 --> 09:50.715
...corporate.

09:58.307 --> 10:00.719
Was there something
that you needed, John?

10:00.809 --> 10:04.393
l was hoping you and I could talk about
the elephant in the room.

10:06.774 --> 10:09.766
I assume you're referring
to the fact that I killed you.

10:09.860 --> 10:11.350
Yeah.

10:18.702 --> 10:21.569
It was the only way to
get you back to the island,

10:21.663 --> 10:24.325
along with as many of those
who left as possible.

10:24.666 --> 10:28.625
You do remember that's why you left,
to convince them to come back.

10:30.339 --> 10:34.457
But you failed. And the only way to
bring them together was by your death.

10:34.551 --> 10:38.669
You understood. It's why you were about
to kill yourself when I stopped you.

10:38.764 --> 10:41.471
If all I had to do was die,
then why did you stop me?

10:41.558 --> 10:44.675
You had critical information
that would've died with you.

10:44.770 --> 10:46.726
Once you'd given it to me...

10:51.026 --> 10:54.393
I didn't have time to talk you
back into hanging yourself.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.238
So I took a shortcut.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.782
And look at you, John... l was right.

11:01.745 --> 11:04.452
You're here. You're back.
So are the rest of them.

11:04.581 --> 11:07.994
I don't know where yet, exactly,
but they came. It worked.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.455
And that's Why I did it...

11:16.802 --> 11:20.260
...because it was
in the best interests of the island.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.633
l was just hoping for an apology.

11:30.858 --> 11:33.565
I've decided to help you, Ben.

11:35.279 --> 11:36.769
Help me do what?

11:36.905 --> 11:40.022
Do what you say
you were on your way to do.

11:41.076 --> 11:43.818
- Be judged.
- That's not something you want to see.

11:43.912 --> 11:47.951
If everything you've done has been
in the best interest of the island...

11:51.420 --> 11:54.332
...then I'm sure
the monster will understand.

12:00.554 --> 12:01.634
Let's go.

12:10.731 --> 12:12.187
Hey!

12:12.774 --> 12:16.062
- What are you doing?
- We're taking a boat.

12:16.153 --> 12:18.860
- Where?
- Over to the main island.

12:21.116 --> 12:23.357
I don't think so, my friend.

12:23.452 --> 12:25.738
- Are these your boats?
- Are they yours?

12:27.706 --> 12:31.415
Caesar, right? I was under
the impression these were found here.

12:31.501 --> 12:33.162
So l'mjust going to borrow one.

12:33.253 --> 12:36.962
I'm happy to leave the other boat
for you in case you want to follow us.

12:37.049 --> 12:38.914
"Us"?

12:39.009 --> 12:42.877
- Are you going with him?
- He didn't really give me a choice.

12:47.768 --> 12:50.134
I'm sorry,
but I'm calling the shots here,

12:50.228 --> 12:52.310
and I said you're not taking anything.

12:52.397 --> 12:55.434
You are going to sit down
and tell us how you know so much

12:55.525 --> 12:57.607
about this island, my friend.

13:01.865 --> 13:04.572
You're in the habit
of calling people "friend,"

13:04.660 --> 13:07.777
- but I don't think you mean it.
- Step away from the boat.

13:07.871 --> 13:11.409
No. I'm not going to step away
from the boat. I'm going to take it.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.286
You're going to let me, my friend.

13:13.377 --> 13:15.834
- You're not taking...
- You looking for this?

13:23.053 --> 13:25.760
This gentleman and l are taking a boat.

13:27.516 --> 13:29.882
Does anyone else
have a problem with that?

13:41.905 --> 13:43.861
Consider that my apology.

14:13.770 --> 14:15.510
Home sweet home.

14:17.107 --> 14:20.474
Looks like we're not the first ones
who decided to tie up here.

14:21.570 --> 14:25.529
That'll be Sun and Lapidus.
I showed them where the boats were,

14:25.615 --> 14:28.743
Sun thanked me by smashing me
on the head with a paddle.

14:29.995 --> 14:31.610
She the one that hurt your arm?

14:31.705 --> 14:34.412
I noticed you were
favoring it on the way over.

14:34.499 --> 14:36.455
No.

14:38.795 --> 14:41.047
Someone else hurt my arm.

14:41.131 --> 14:44.043
You just make friends
everywhere you go, don't you?

14:44.134 --> 14:46.466
Well, I found, sometimes, that friends

14:46.553 --> 14:49.761
can be significantly more
dangerous than enemies, John.

14:51.183 --> 14:53.720
Is that why you shot
an unarmed man in the chest?

14:53.810 --> 14:56.426
The man was unarmed
because I'd stolen his gun.

14:56.521 --> 14:58.807
The gun he was going to use to kill you.

14:59.357 --> 15:02.815
- Couldn't let that happen.
- No sense in me dying twice, right?

15:03.987 --> 15:05.147
You're welcome.

15:07.491 --> 15:09.982
We're going to your old house,
aren't we?

15:10.077 --> 15:11.613
Yes.

15:11.703 --> 15:14.661
It's the only place I can summon it...

15:14.790 --> 15:16.451
...the monster.

15:17.334 --> 15:20.041
Once it arrives,
l'll either be forgiven...

15:22.089 --> 15:25.331
- ...or I won't.
- I think you're lying.

15:28.386 --> 15:30.593
- About what?
- That you want to be judged

15:30.680 --> 15:34.923
for leaving the island and coming back
because it's against the rules.

15:35.018 --> 15:39.432
- I don't think you care about rules.
- What do I want to be judged for, John?

15:39.523 --> 15:41.434
For killing your daughter.

16:04.047 --> 16:07.005
Well? Did you do it?

16:11.179 --> 16:12.965
We had a... complication.

16:16.726 --> 16:19.468
I'm sorry, is that a... baby?

16:21.148 --> 16:24.265
Your orders were to
exterminate that woman.

16:24.359 --> 16:27.396
Why? She's no threat to us...
she's insane, Charles.

16:28.071 --> 16:31.313
Besides, you didn't tell me
she had a child.

16:31.408 --> 16:33.444
What was it l was supposed to do?

16:34.077 --> 16:37.911
- Kill it!
- It's not an "it." This is a child.

16:44.546 --> 16:47.288
You might find this
difficult to understand, Benjamin,

16:47.382 --> 16:51.341
every decision I've made
has been about protecting this island.

16:51.428 --> 16:53.760
ls killing this baby what Jacob wants?

17:03.315 --> 17:04.395
Then here she is.

17:10.155 --> 17:11.816
You do it.

17:52.948 --> 17:55.439
So whose idea was it
to move into these houses?

17:56.826 --> 18:00.159
- Excuse me?
- Your people were living in the jungle,

18:00.288 --> 18:03.621
then after you murdered
the Dharma folk, you relocated here.

18:03.708 --> 18:05.915
Just wondered if it was your idea.

18:08.964 --> 18:10.249
Do you disapprove?

18:10.340 --> 18:13.377
Just doesn't seem like something
the island would want.

18:13.510 --> 18:15.842
You don't have the first idea
what this island wants.

18:15.971 --> 18:17.882
Are you sure about that?

18:26.022 --> 18:29.480
- That was your house, wasn't it?
- Yes. And that's Alex's room.

18:31.528 --> 18:34.486
I suppose you'd better
go over there and check it out.

19:23.705 --> 19:24.785
Sun?

19:29.044 --> 19:32.036
- What are you doing here?
- This used to be my house.

19:32.130 --> 19:35.497
I saw a light turned on.
What are the two of you doing in here?

19:45.268 --> 19:47.179
That was taken in 1977.

19:47.270 --> 19:49.932
Your friends were in
the Dharma lnitiative?

19:50.023 --> 19:51.934
You don't know about this?

19:53.276 --> 19:55.938
Of course not.

19:56.029 --> 19:58.145
Where'd you get this?
Who gave this to you?

19:58.239 --> 20:02.278
- We met some crazy old man outside.
- He said his name was Christian.

20:03.453 --> 20:06.115
- He told us to come in and wait.
- Wait for what?

20:06.206 --> 20:08.788
He said if I ever wanted
to see my husband again,

20:08.875 --> 20:10.615
I had to wait here for John Locke.

20:13.088 --> 20:15.170
He's dead. We ain't holding our breath.

20:15.256 --> 20:17.542
You might want to look outside.

20:41.533 --> 20:44.400
What you're saying, it's... impossible.

20:45.078 --> 20:47.160
But here I am.

20:47.247 --> 20:49.408
I don't know how, I don't why,

20:49.499 --> 20:51.990
but I'm sure there's
a very good reason for it.

20:52.085 --> 20:56.454
As long as the dead guy says there's
a reason, everything's gonna be peachy.

20:57.090 --> 21:01.083
Forget the fact that the rest of your
people are supposedly 30 years ago,

21:01.219 --> 21:04.552
now the only ones here to help us
are a murderer

21:04.639 --> 21:07.506
and a guy who can't remember
how he got out of a coffin.

21:07.600 --> 21:12.014
Sun, please...
Let's just go back to the plane.

21:12.147 --> 21:14.809
See if! can fix the radio.
Maybe we can get help.

21:18.361 --> 21:21.649
If you leave with him,
you'll never find your husband again.

21:23.741 --> 21:25.197
I'm all the help you need.

21:25.326 --> 21:27.533
Are you saying you know
how to find them?

21:28.955 --> 21:31.537
- How to find Jin?
- l have some ideas.

21:32.417 --> 21:35.875
I'm sorry to say it,
but I'm leaving with or without you.

21:36.004 --> 21:41.169
If there's any chance of finding
my husband, then I have to stay.

21:42.719 --> 21:44.255
All right.

21:48.391 --> 21:51.133
Well, for God's sake, watch your back.

22:00.028 --> 22:03.191
All right. How do we find Jin?

22:05.325 --> 22:08.317
Ben has something to do first.
Isn't that right, Ben?

22:10.580 --> 22:13.572
- Yes, John. That's right.
- Better get to it then.

23:57.812 --> 23:59.518
I'll be outside.

24:06.446 --> 24:09.813
- Again, Daddy! Again!
- OK, OK.

24:09.907 --> 24:13.525
Wow, Alex, any higher and
you're gonna fly right off the island!

24:18.166 --> 24:19.622
The sub's about to leave.

24:19.709 --> 24:22.451
Higher, Daddy, higher!

24:22.545 --> 24:26.037
- All right.
- You don't have to see him off, Ben.

24:26.132 --> 24:29.920
- Yes, Richard. I do.
- Higher, higher, Daddy.

24:39.103 --> 24:40.388
Charles.

24:44.942 --> 24:48.480
- I came to say goodbye.
- No, you didn't.

24:48.571 --> 24:51.654
- You came to gloat.
- No, don't act as if I wanted this.

24:51.741 --> 24:55.404
- You brought this on yourself.
- Are you certain you want to do this?

24:55.495 --> 24:59.613
You left the island regularly.
You had a daughter with an outsider.

24:59.707 --> 25:00.992
You broke the rules.

25:01.084 --> 25:03.826
What makes you think
you deserve to take what's mine?

25:03.920 --> 25:05.410
Because I won't be selfish.

25:05.546 --> 25:08.583
l'll sacrifice anything
to protect this island.

25:08.675 --> 25:13.544
- You wouldn't sacrifice Alex.
- You're the one who wanted her dead.

25:13.638 --> 25:15.219
Not the island.

25:17.934 --> 25:19.640
I hope you're right, Benjamin.

25:19.727 --> 25:24.266
Because if you aren't, and it is
the island that wants her dead...

25:24.357 --> 25:25.722
...she'll be dead.

25:26.442 --> 25:29.934
And one day, you'll be standing
where I'm standing now.

25:31.322 --> 25:33.563
You'll be the one being banished.

25:33.658 --> 25:38.118
And then you'll finally realize
that you cannot fight the inevitable.

25:42.458 --> 25:44.369
I'll be seeing you, boy.

26:07.316 --> 26:09.227
Where did John go?

26:09.318 --> 26:13.357
- He said he has something to do.
- Did he say what it was?

26:14.615 --> 26:16.697
No, I didn't ask.

26:20.204 --> 26:22.240
- Jack must have lied.
- Excuse me?

26:22.331 --> 26:25.038
About Locke being dead.
I don't know why he would,

26:25.126 --> 26:27.082
but that's the only explanation.

26:27.170 --> 26:30.333
Jack didn't lie. John was dead.

26:30.465 --> 26:32.877
Just because he was in a coffin
doesn't mean

26:32.967 --> 26:36.004
- he couldn't have faked...
- Trust me. I'm sure.

26:41.642 --> 26:46.682
So you knew this would happen to Locke
if we brought him back here?

26:48.900 --> 26:51.016
Sun, I had no idea it would happen.

26:51.986 --> 26:56.946
I've seen this island do miraculous
things. I've seen it heal the sick.

26:57.033 --> 26:59.399
But never once has it done
anything like this.

27:02.371 --> 27:05.363
Dead is dead.

27:05.458 --> 27:07.915
You don't get to come back from that.

27:08.002 --> 27:09.583
Not even here.

27:11.172 --> 27:14.915
So the fact that John Locke
is walking around this island...

27:15.009 --> 27:17.341
...scares the living hell out of me.

27:27.814 --> 27:30.521
- You may want to go inside.
- Why?

27:33.152 --> 27:37.361
Because what's about to come out of that
jungle is something I can't control.

27:45.790 --> 27:49.578
- Any luck?
- It hasn't shown up yet.

27:51.003 --> 27:54.040
- Last time we didn't wait this long.
- It's not a train.

27:54.131 --> 27:56.747
It doesn't run on a schedule.

27:56.843 --> 28:00.176
Well, if it's not
going to come to us, then...

28:00.263 --> 28:02.254
...I suppose we'll have to go to it.

28:03.182 --> 28:06.140
It doesn't work that way.
I only know how to summon it.

28:06.227 --> 28:08.639
I don't know where it actually is.

28:09.730 --> 28:11.436
I do.

28:22.994 --> 28:24.700
It's weird for me, too.

28:26.747 --> 28:31.116
- Excuse me?
- I realize how strange this all is.

28:32.628 --> 28:34.334
Me... here.

28:36.340 --> 28:40.128
But I assure you, Sun,
I'm the same man I've always been.

28:44.390 --> 28:47.553
- Are you ready?
- Lead the way.

28:57.737 --> 29:00.399
- Hello.
- Charles?

29:00.489 --> 29:03.322
- lt's Benjamin.
- How did you get this number?

29:03.409 --> 29:07.573
It doesn't matter, what matters is
I'm going back to the island today.

29:07.663 --> 29:10.700
The island won't let you
come back. Trust me.

29:10.791 --> 29:14.249
- I've spent 20 years trying to return.
- Well, Charles...

29:14.337 --> 29:16.999
...where you failed,
I'm going to succeed.

29:18.090 --> 29:20.376
Just as soon as I do one thing.

29:21.636 --> 29:25.299
- What's that, Benjamin?
- Kill your daughter.

29:27.224 --> 29:30.182
In fact, I'm looking at
Our Mutual Friend right now.

29:31.312 --> 29:35.476
- Don't know what you're talking about.
- The name of the boat that Penny is on.

29:35.566 --> 29:40.151
- Don't you dare.
- Goodbye, Charles.

29:50.206 --> 29:53.698
- May | ask you a question, John?
- Shoot.

29:53.793 --> 29:56.375
How is it you that you know
where you're going?

29:58.965 --> 30:00.296
| just know.

30:00.383 --> 30:02.669
- How does that work?
- How does what work?

30:02.760 --> 30:05.797
The knowing.
Did it come upon you gradually,

30:05.888 --> 30:09.426
or did you wake up and understand
the mysteries of the universe?

30:09.517 --> 30:12.224
- You don't like this, do you?
- What?

30:12.395 --> 30:15.387
Having to ask questions
you don't know the answers to.

30:15.481 --> 30:16.982
Blindly following someone

30:17.066 --> 30:20.229
in the hopes they'll lead you
to whatever you're looking for.

30:23.572 --> 30:26.314
- No, John. I don't like it at all.
-Well...

30:27.076 --> 30:29.408
Now you know what it was like to be me.

30:35.292 --> 30:36.577
We should keep moving.

30:38.796 --> 30:40.411
Yes, we should.

30:45.386 --> 30:47.718
I think I know
where we're going now, John.

30:47.805 --> 30:49.295
Do you?

30:49.390 --> 30:51.881
It's the same place
they brought me as a child.

30:53.352 --> 30:55.968
It's where the island healed me.

30:56.063 --> 30:57.564
Well...

31:00.609 --> 31:03.351
Let's hope it's as generous
this time around.

31:11.245 --> 31:15.534
- What is it?
- It's the wall around our Temple.

31:17.668 --> 31:21.877
- What Temple?
- About a half mile from here.

31:21.964 --> 31:26.333
They built this wall to keep people
like the two of you from ever seeing it.

31:31.974 --> 31:35.387
We're not going into your Temple, Ben.

31:43.986 --> 31:45.601
We're going under it.

31:57.416 --> 31:59.327
After you.

32:05.633 --> 32:08.215
I need to ask a favor of you, Sun.

32:08.302 --> 32:11.669
If you can ever get off this island,
find Desmond Hume for me,

32:11.806 --> 32:13.922
tell him I said I was sorry.

32:15.643 --> 32:16.803
Sorry for what?

32:19.730 --> 32:21.186
He'll know.

32:56.392 --> 33:00.385
Hey! What are you doing here?

33:04.608 --> 33:06.223
Desmond!

33:06.652 --> 33:07.858
Desmond!

33:07.945 --> 33:12.689
- Des?!
- Don't move! Not another word!

33:15.161 --> 33:18.745
Hello, Penelope.
My name is Benjamin Linus.

33:18.914 --> 33:22.623
I'm sorry you're caught up in
the middle of this, but your father...

33:22.751 --> 33:24.742
My father and l have no relation...

33:24.837 --> 33:27.328
Your father is a really
terrible human being.

33:29.049 --> 33:32.917
He's responsible for the killing
of my daughter. That's why I'm here.

33:34.096 --> 33:35.961
Mommy!

33:36.891 --> 33:40.383
Charlie, go back inside, babe.
Go back inside.

33:41.812 --> 33:45.646
Please! Please, whatever you do, don't
hurt my son! Please don't hurt my son.

33:46.650 --> 33:50.814
- Mommy? Mommy?
- Charlie, go inside!

34:22.186 --> 34:23.926
Captain Lapidus!

34:24.021 --> 34:26.182
Captain Lapidus!

34:26.315 --> 34:28.897
You're back, thank God.

34:28.984 --> 34:30.895
They found guns.

34:30.986 --> 34:32.817
What are you talking about? Who?

34:32.905 --> 34:34.770
llana and three of the others.

34:34.865 --> 34:39.029
- They said they were in charge now.
- Where are they?

34:47.628 --> 34:49.664
llana!

34:52.841 --> 34:53.876
What's going on?

34:54.009 --> 34:58.343
- What lies in the shadow of the statue?
- What?

34:58.430 --> 35:00.261
Answer the question!

35:02.101 --> 35:05.264
What lies in the shadow of the statue?

35:09.191 --> 35:10.692
l have no idea what...

35:14.863 --> 35:18.856
Get everyone else, tell them it's time.
Then tie him up...

35:21.412 --> 35:23.073
He's coming with us.

35:57.531 --> 36:00.068
You know, you were right.

36:00.200 --> 36:03.613
- About what?
- Why I need to be judged.

36:05.205 --> 36:08.242
When Charles Widmore's men came,
they gave me a choice.

36:10.336 --> 36:13.203
Either leave the island
or let my daughter die.

36:14.840 --> 36:18.253
All I had to do was walk out
of the house and go with them.

36:21.972 --> 36:23.928
But I didn't do it.

36:24.933 --> 36:27.470
So you were right. John...

36:28.771 --> 36:30.807
...I did kill Alex.

36:33.609 --> 36:35.895
And now l have to answer for that.

36:40.866 --> 36:44.734
I appreciate you showing me the way,
but I think I can take it from here.

36:48.374 --> 36:49.409
You got it.

36:57.841 --> 37:00.127
I'll meet you outside, ifl live...

37:05.224 --> 37:06.464
Ben!

37:09.728 --> 37:11.514
Are you all right?

37:13.607 --> 37:15.518
Never better.

37:15.651 --> 37:18.233
Hang on. I'll find something
to get you out.

37:18.320 --> 37:20.982
John, wait!

39:00.756 --> 39:02.792
You didn't tell me she had a child.

39:02.883 --> 39:04.874
What was it l was supposed to do?

39:05.928 --> 39:09.170
- Kill it.
- It's not an "it." This is a child.

39:09.264 --> 39:10.253
Higher!

39:10.349 --> 39:12.180
Again, Daddy! Again!

39:12.935 --> 39:15.267
Higher! Higher, Daddy!

39:15.354 --> 39:16.890
I hate you!

39:17.564 --> 39:21.227
I hate your guts.
| wish you were dead.

39:21.318 --> 39:24.276
These people,
you said they're dangerous.

39:25.614 --> 39:27.104
More dangerous than you?

39:28.283 --> 39:30.945
Dad... they're serious.

39:31.828 --> 39:34.114
They killed Karl and my mother.

39:35.123 --> 39:37.785
Please, Dad...

39:39.503 --> 39:42.916
- Help me!
- She's not my daughter.

39:43.006 --> 39:44.837
She means nothing to me.

39:44.925 --> 39:48.213
So if you wanna kill her,
go ahead and...

40:10.701 --> 40:12.316
Daddy?

40:15.706 --> 40:17.116
Alex.

40:18.917 --> 40:20.077
Hi, Dad.

40:22.337 --> 40:24.373
Alex.

40:28.302 --> 40:30.839
I'm so, so sorry.

40:35.517 --> 40:37.974
It was all my fault.

40:41.440 --> 40:43.556
I know.

40:49.865 --> 40:52.106
Listen to me, you bastard.

40:52.200 --> 40:55.328
I know that you're already planning
to kill John again.

40:56.371 --> 40:59.454
And I want you to know
that if you so much as touch him,

40:59.541 --> 41:02.533
I will hunt you down and destroy you.

41:03.879 --> 41:07.042
You will listen
to every word John Locke says,

41:07.132 --> 41:10.795
and you will follow his every order.
Do you understand?

41:12.888 --> 41:16.130
Say it! Say you'll follow him!

41:16.224 --> 41:18.431
Yes, lwill.
I'll follow him, I swear.

41:45.170 --> 41:47.081
Ben?

41:51.885 --> 41:53.546
Ben!

41:56.723 --> 41:57.758
Ben?

42:04.606 --> 42:05.641
What happened?

42:12.072 --> 42:13.778
lt let me live.
