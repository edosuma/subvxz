WEBVTT

01:51.850 --> 01:54.936
I don't want to touch a raw nerve, King Ragnar,

01:55.019 --> 01:57.981
but I understand that
your brother betrayed you.

01:58.314 --> 02:01.443
That he stands
between us and Paris.

02:01.818 --> 02:04.070
So, what do you
suggest we do?

02:04.154 --> 02:06.072
I suggest we do the obvious.

02:08.699 --> 02:12.954
We try and sail straight
past the fort, up river.

02:14.164 --> 02:17.417
But we protect our heads
as we force our way through.

02:18.877 --> 02:21.463
Isn't that what your brother
is going to expect us to do?

02:21.546 --> 02:25.133
Yes, but he won't be expecting
us to attack by land also.

02:26.384 --> 02:28.219
In unison with the boats,

02:28.303 --> 02:30.472
we'll send a party on foot
to the nearest fort.

02:31.222 --> 02:32.640
And they will
engage the archers,

02:32.724 --> 02:35.727
diverting their attention
away from the boats.

02:36.561 --> 02:37.562
Yes?

02:38.563 --> 02:42.066
I agree. The boats have
more chance without
the archers' hindrance.

02:42.734 --> 02:44.277
Any objections?

02:48.615 --> 02:50.825
I'll lead that party by foot.

02:52.243 --> 02:53.745
Then it is agreed
we attack tomorrow.

02:53.828 --> 02:55.038
Yeah!

02:55.121 --> 02:58.124
At least, let ours be
the first boat through.

03:00.251 --> 03:01.920
Mmm.

03:08.885 --> 03:10.136
Erlendur.

03:11.429 --> 03:13.431
This belongs
to you, yes?

03:16.768 --> 03:19.103
It is your father,
King Horik's ring.

03:19.312 --> 03:22.649
Mmm. No, you're mistaken.
I've never seen
that ring before.

03:25.193 --> 03:26.194
What happened?

03:26.945 --> 03:29.072
He said
it was not his ring.

03:29.405 --> 03:30.406
He's lying.

03:31.157 --> 03:33.493
I know it is
his father's ring.

03:39.874 --> 03:41.751
Forgive me for caring,

03:42.168 --> 03:44.587
but you shouldn't
fight tomorrow.

03:48.800 --> 03:51.636
Let me explain
something to you.

03:52.929 --> 03:55.723
A long time ago,
the Seer prophesized

03:55.807 --> 03:58.434
that I would never
have another child.

04:01.229 --> 04:02.730
If he's right,

04:03.648 --> 04:05.817
it doesn't matter
what I do.

04:06.484 --> 04:07.652
Well.

04:08.486 --> 04:12.365
You're certainly doing
everything in your power

04:12.448 --> 04:14.951
to prove the Seer's
prophecy right.

04:27.338 --> 04:28.631
Father.

04:31.634 --> 04:33.428
Can we fight
with you tomorrow?

04:35.221 --> 04:36.431
Please.

04:36.723 --> 04:39.225
You're not strong
enough yet, boys.

04:43.021 --> 04:44.981
I want you to stay here.

04:45.732 --> 04:48.401
I want you to protect
all the food
and the supplies.

04:48.484 --> 04:50.236
Can you do that for me?
Yes, Father.

04:50.320 --> 04:51.905
Yes? Okay.
Yes.

04:53.865 --> 04:55.199
Good boys.

04:56.326 --> 04:58.119
Keep your bows close.

05:32.528 --> 05:33.696
I live for this.

05:33.947 --> 05:35.573
The only reason
to be alive.

05:36.032 --> 05:36.991
Hmm.

05:37.075 --> 05:39.243
The space between
life and death,

05:40.411 --> 05:43.247
that's where we
are the most alive.

06:13.403 --> 06:15.613
I hate my uncle.

06:20.743 --> 06:22.453
I want to kill him.

06:24.330 --> 06:25.623
Good.

06:50.064 --> 06:52.525
May God be with us this day!

07:03.369 --> 07:04.495
Don't be afraid.

07:04.829 --> 07:06.664
If I was afraid,
I wouldn't be here.

07:59.717 --> 08:00.927
Not yet.

09:20.423 --> 09:21.841
Pull!

09:21.924 --> 09:23.217
Pull!

09:23.301 --> 09:26.262
Pull! Pull!

09:26.345 --> 09:28.764
Pull! Pull!

09:29.307 --> 09:32.018
Pull!

09:32.101 --> 09:34.103
Pull! Pull!

09:34.187 --> 09:35.479
Pull harder!

10:25.947 --> 10:27.198
Where is your mother?

10:39.543 --> 10:41.087
Everybody out!

10:41.170 --> 10:42.546
Dry land to the left!

11:02.108 --> 11:03.234
Halt.

11:28.759 --> 11:30.136
Forward!

11:32.930 --> 11:34.765
- Pull!
- Heave!

11:46.068 --> 11:48.612
Men, go forward!

11:54.285 --> 11:57.246
Pull! Pull!

12:01.334 --> 12:02.543
Pull!

12:03.836 --> 12:04.837
Pull!

12:09.175 --> 12:10.634
Come on!

12:10.760 --> 12:13.012
Pull! Pull!

12:41.832 --> 12:43.667
Initiate!

12:52.301 --> 12:54.428
Stop! Stop!

12:54.512 --> 12:56.138
Go back! Turn starboard!

13:00.351 --> 13:01.519
Stop! Halt!

13:02.520 --> 13:03.771
Turn right!

13:07.691 --> 13:09.568
Push! Push!

13:47.356 --> 13:48.357
Pull!

14:26.562 --> 14:29.148
Up onto
the overturned keel.

14:29.231 --> 14:31.525
Clamber,
with a heart of steel.

14:33.194 --> 14:35.404
Cold is the ocean's spray.

14:39.533 --> 14:41.410
And your death is on its way.

15:04.934 --> 15:05.935
Come!

15:22.409 --> 15:23.911
Please, please, come.

15:23.994 --> 15:24.995
Shields!

15:39.802 --> 15:41.345
Take my hand!

16:19.466 --> 16:20.467
No!

16:20.759 --> 16:21.760
Boys! Ubbe!

16:22.970 --> 16:24.722
Run! Run!

17:34.500 --> 17:35.876
From the other side!

17:35.959 --> 17:37.044
Attack!

17:55.229 --> 17:56.230
Retreat!

17:57.022 --> 17:58.065
Retreat!

18:11.078 --> 18:12.287
Take it!

18:15.916 --> 18:17.084
Pull! Pull!

19:03.130 --> 19:04.548
Shields! Shields!

19:05.007 --> 19:06.133
Help the others!

19:06.216 --> 19:07.551
And this is how
you repay me.

19:07.634 --> 19:08.677
Shields up!

19:09.511 --> 19:10.554
Father!

19:11.972 --> 19:12.973
Ragnar!

19:13.724 --> 19:14.975
Father!

19:15.058 --> 19:17.311
When everyone
wanted you dead,

19:17.394 --> 19:19.104
I kept you alive!

19:20.063 --> 19:21.565
You hurt me, brother.

19:21.899 --> 19:23.066
You hurt me, brother.

19:23.400 --> 19:24.818
We have to retreat.

19:27.362 --> 19:29.865
And this is how
you repay my love?

19:33.660 --> 19:35.204
Row! Row away!

19:35.287 --> 19:36.997
Row away!

19:37.080 --> 19:38.081
Row!

19:38.165 --> 19:40.417
Row! Row!
Shields!

20:22.793 --> 20:24.461
A great victory,
Count Rollo, hmm?

20:31.843 --> 20:33.345
So many women.

20:33.762 --> 20:35.472
Who'd have thought.

20:36.056 --> 20:37.849
They're as brave
as the men.

20:38.934 --> 20:41.853
Sometimes, they are
much braver than the men.

20:42.187 --> 20:43.647
And the most fierce,

20:43.730 --> 20:45.524
her name is Lagertha.

20:45.607 --> 20:47.067
You know her?

20:48.110 --> 20:50.654
She was
my brother's wife.

20:51.530 --> 20:53.115
Is she with him now?

20:53.657 --> 20:54.741
Yes.

20:55.242 --> 20:56.827
Did you see her?

20:57.411 --> 20:58.495
Yes.

20:59.955 --> 21:02.082
Then perhaps
I will see her.

21:02.207 --> 21:04.001
Even get to meet her.

21:04.835 --> 21:06.086
Perhaps.

21:09.881 --> 21:12.092
I don't understand
why you are here.

21:12.759 --> 21:15.762
You had no idea
Ragnar had gone
away to Paris?

21:15.846 --> 21:17.347
No.

21:17.973 --> 21:20.392
But I heard about
the raid on Paris.

21:20.475 --> 21:22.144
I heard he was very sick.

21:22.227 --> 21:25.814
I wondered, in fact,
if he was still alive.

21:35.699 --> 21:37.701
He has gone
back to Paris.

21:37.784 --> 21:40.954
This time, he's taken
Ubbe and Hvitserk with him.

21:45.042 --> 21:46.335
He's punishing me

21:46.418 --> 21:48.920
because of what
happened last time.

21:56.845 --> 21:59.640
Where else have
your wanderings
taken you?

22:01.642 --> 22:04.144
Oh, so many places, uh,

22:04.227 --> 22:06.146
I could not count them.

22:06.605 --> 22:08.815
Walked between worlds,

22:08.899 --> 22:11.234
between the living
and the dead.

22:31.088 --> 22:32.923
I often dream of you.

22:35.842 --> 22:36.843
Hmm.

22:37.427 --> 22:38.762
After all,

22:41.973 --> 22:43.767
I'm glad to be back.

23:00.117 --> 23:02.285
Go on! Mount up!

23:06.623 --> 23:07.958
Attention!

23:14.756 --> 23:17.008
May the Lord bless
your journey to Mercia.

23:40.031 --> 23:41.283
Go on!

24:01.511 --> 24:03.722
Halt!
Halt!

24:04.931 --> 24:06.183
Halt!

24:42.135 --> 24:43.303
Helga!

24:44.179 --> 24:45.347
Helga!

24:51.394 --> 24:53.480
Where are you, Horik?

24:54.397 --> 24:55.565
Floki.

24:58.902 --> 25:01.071
Morag! Where are you?

25:15.585 --> 25:17.212
No, don't die, Helga.

25:17.462 --> 25:18.880
Please don't die.

25:26.179 --> 25:27.806
Father. Father!

26:20.483 --> 26:23.653
So, the Northmen
were repulsed.

26:23.862 --> 26:25.071
Yes, Your Highness.

26:25.155 --> 26:27.407
Today, your forces
won a great victory.

26:27.490 --> 26:28.908
We sunk many of their ships

26:28.992 --> 26:30.452
and routed them
in the field!

26:37.167 --> 26:38.835
What do you say,
Your Grace?

26:39.336 --> 26:42.797
I say we have simply
delayed my brother's
passage up the river.

26:42.881 --> 26:43.882
That is all.

26:43.965 --> 26:46.426
Oh, come, come,
Your Grace.

26:46.676 --> 26:47.927
Much more than that, surely!

26:48.011 --> 26:49.596
You saw how it was.

26:49.679 --> 26:52.098
We should celebrate
a great victory.

26:53.391 --> 26:54.768
As long as my brother
is still alive,

26:54.851 --> 26:56.519
there is nothing
to celebrate.

26:58.396 --> 27:01.024
Ah, perhaps you do not
wish to celebrate

27:01.107 --> 27:03.234
the defeat of your own kind.

27:03.318 --> 27:05.779
I saw how it was today,
Count Odo.

27:05.862 --> 27:07.447
And after all the Duke
has done for us,

27:07.530 --> 27:10.450
how dare you accuse him
of not being committed
to our cause?

27:10.533 --> 27:12.786
My Lady, I merely
asked a question.

27:12.869 --> 27:14.746
Personally, I see no reason

27:14.829 --> 27:17.457
to doubt
His Grace's sincerity.

27:17.540 --> 27:18.750
Nor do I.

27:19.959 --> 27:22.045
And I take notice
of his warning

27:22.128 --> 27:24.839
that our struggles
are only just beginning.

27:26.216 --> 27:27.884
After all, Count Odo,

27:28.551 --> 27:30.970
His Grace knows
the ways of the Northmen

27:31.054 --> 27:32.639
far better than you.

28:38.538 --> 28:40.999
Why can't you tell
me what happened?

28:41.833 --> 28:42.917
It's difficult.

28:43.293 --> 28:44.961
Why is it difficult?

28:47.130 --> 28:49.674
Because it
is my father's fault.

28:51.885 --> 28:53.386
Are you happy?

28:54.012 --> 28:55.805
Do you have children?

28:58.057 --> 29:00.143
You know how to get
children, don't you?

29:01.686 --> 29:04.355
Haven't you seen
what the horses
do to the mares?

29:13.156 --> 29:16.284
You'll have
three children.

29:16.409 --> 29:17.827
Don't worry.

29:27.295 --> 29:29.172
Where is your husband?

29:29.672 --> 29:31.674
He has gone riding
with King Ragnar.

29:32.342 --> 29:33.885
You must be very lonely.

29:36.888 --> 29:39.349
You are too beautiful
to be sad.

29:41.559 --> 29:43.561
I can't understand it.

29:43.728 --> 29:45.730
I don't know who you are,

29:46.606 --> 29:50.527
but when you look at me,
I feel happy and good.

29:51.569 --> 29:53.696
Full of hope for the future.

29:55.323 --> 29:57.659
I know you are
truly a holy man.

29:58.993 --> 30:01.120
A man close to the gods.

30:36.406 --> 30:39.242
Yidu! Yidu!

30:54.215 --> 30:56.718
Give me some of that
Chinese medicine.

31:00.346 --> 31:01.931
But don't you
want to sleep?

31:02.223 --> 31:03.474
No, just give it to me.

31:04.475 --> 31:06.269
There's no more left.

31:08.354 --> 31:11.149
Look, woman, things went
very badly today.

31:11.649 --> 31:14.402
I won't argue.
Just give it to me.

31:14.485 --> 31:15.612
Please.

31:16.487 --> 31:17.530
King Harald said today...

31:17.614 --> 31:19.115
I don't care
what King Harald...

31:19.782 --> 31:20.783
Where is it?

31:31.377 --> 31:32.503
Where is it?

31:39.469 --> 31:40.637
Ragnar.

33:48.931 --> 33:51.726
These runes will
cure you, my dear Helga.

37:32.905 --> 37:34.323
Amen.

38:57.740 --> 39:00.659
This is the man
I knew only as W,

39:02.203 --> 39:04.663
who is really
Prince Wigstan

39:04.747 --> 39:06.373
of the Mercian
royal family.

39:06.916 --> 39:08.042
Is that correct?

39:08.125 --> 39:09.585
Yes, King Ecbert.

39:09.668 --> 39:11.253
That is correct.

39:13.714 --> 39:15.966
Interesting place
for our meeting.

39:16.050 --> 39:17.551
I believe it is.

39:17.927 --> 39:21.639
For this is the mausoleum
of the kings and
queens of Mercia.

39:22.014 --> 39:23.349
My family.

39:24.475 --> 39:28.104
Those caskets contain
the bones of my ancestors.

39:28.521 --> 39:31.524
Many from the
golden age of Mercia

39:31.607 --> 39:34.819
when our kingdom
was powerful, proud,

39:34.902 --> 39:39.073
and stood head and
shoulders above any other
kingdom on this island.

39:40.074 --> 39:42.535
Many more contain
the bones of those
who have died

39:42.618 --> 39:45.788
in the frenzied
bloodlettings of
our recent past.

39:47.456 --> 39:49.250
Here lie my father,

39:49.708 --> 39:52.503
brother, uncles,

39:52.586 --> 39:53.963
and my sons.

39:55.506 --> 39:59.260
And here
is my sainted mother.

40:01.929 --> 40:05.391
She watched her grandsons
butchered before her eyes

40:05.474 --> 40:07.017
before they blinded her,

40:07.101 --> 40:10.062
cut out her tongue,
cut off her breasts,

40:10.146 --> 40:12.857
and burnt her while
she was still alive.

40:13.482 --> 40:14.608
And who did this?

40:15.526 --> 40:16.861
My family.

40:18.112 --> 40:23.492
The ruined, corrupt,
decadent dregs of
a once illustrious name.

40:25.244 --> 40:27.788
And you shelter
for your own purposes

40:27.872 --> 40:30.958
another of my mad
descendants.

40:31.458 --> 40:32.835
Kwenthrith,

40:33.294 --> 40:34.545
whose only claim
to the throne

40:34.628 --> 40:38.007
rests in the murder
of her own uncle and
two of her own brothers.

40:38.090 --> 40:43.053
I do not shelter her
out of any love
for her person,

40:43.137 --> 40:45.556
but because I thought
she might be

40:46.515 --> 40:48.475
a stabilizing factor.

40:48.559 --> 40:51.645
The last thing I needed
was a chaotic neighbor.

40:52.813 --> 40:55.441
If you ever supposed
that Kwenthrith

40:55.524 --> 40:57.651
could play a calming,
stabilizing role

40:57.735 --> 41:00.487
in this madhouse
we call Mercia,

41:00.571 --> 41:03.324
then you are as mad
as the rest of them.

41:06.035 --> 41:08.621
However, I doubt it.

41:09.538 --> 41:11.415
I know your ambitions.

41:13.209 --> 41:14.627
And to the point.

41:15.169 --> 41:17.421
You proposed this meeting.

41:18.923 --> 41:20.341
To what end?

41:20.591 --> 41:21.675
Yes.

41:22.176 --> 41:23.510
To the end.

41:23.594 --> 41:24.845
Exactly.

41:26.722 --> 41:29.141
The ruling council,
as they call themselves,

41:29.225 --> 41:31.477
are a lot of fools,
monkeys and drunkards.

41:31.560 --> 41:32.561
Mostly distant relations.

41:33.854 --> 41:35.731
I say a plague on them.

41:36.440 --> 41:38.442
My proposal is simple.

41:38.734 --> 41:41.403
I still have an army,
of sorts.

41:42.196 --> 41:44.031
We will join
with the army
you have brought,

41:44.114 --> 41:48.744
and easily, believe me,
overcome the council
and their lickspits.

41:50.371 --> 41:52.039
And then?

41:52.122 --> 41:53.958
And then, I mean to
renounce this world.

41:54.708 --> 41:57.002
I have seen enough
of its ways.

41:57.962 --> 42:00.256
They corrupted me,
I know that.

42:00.589 --> 42:02.758
But how is it possible
not to be corrupted.

42:04.385 --> 42:06.595
I also lost
my faith in God.

42:07.846 --> 42:09.473
I could
no longer conceive

42:09.556 --> 42:13.769
that our Lord could
sanction the death
of everyone I loved.

42:15.354 --> 42:18.065
But that is
the road to despair.

42:18.148 --> 42:21.110
And I wish before I die
to take the road of hope.

42:21.902 --> 42:23.529
Therefore, after
we are victorious,

42:23.612 --> 42:26.115
I shall quit
Mercia and England.

42:27.324 --> 42:29.952
And travel in
pilgrimage to Rome
as a common beggar.

42:31.704 --> 42:34.915
I only want a chance
to redeem my sins.

42:38.877 --> 42:41.839
And the kingdom?

42:44.133 --> 42:47.052
Waerferth, bring
my mother's casket.

42:52.433 --> 42:55.811
I shall formally renounce
the kingdom in your name.

42:58.147 --> 43:02.318
You will afterwards be king
of Wessex and Mercia.

43:03.485 --> 43:05.529
Your kingdom
will be huge.

43:06.322 --> 43:09.700
But in you, I see
a leader strong and
ambitious enough

43:09.783 --> 43:12.202
to take both our
countries forward

43:12.286 --> 43:14.580
and defend them
against our enemies.

43:14.663 --> 43:17.166
Especially, the Northmen.

43:18.959 --> 43:20.169
Open it.

43:26.175 --> 43:29.553
This was once the
ancestral crown of Mercia.

43:31.347 --> 43:32.848
Now it will be
your crown,

43:33.724 --> 43:35.476
King Ecbert.

44:01.668 --> 44:04.630
We have waited three days
for a plan of attack.

44:04.713 --> 44:07.800
The longer we wait,
the more chances the
Franks will attack us.

44:07.883 --> 44:09.468
What is your decision?

44:12.596 --> 44:13.806
Father!

44:23.232 --> 44:26.568
Tell them
tomorrow that we
go back down river.

44:36.745 --> 44:37.704
Are you all right?

44:37.788 --> 44:40.791
Just tell them
tomorrow we retreat!

44:54.346 --> 44:55.431
What?

44:57.808 --> 44:58.892
Yes.

44:59.601 --> 45:00.853
Tomorrow.

45:01.395 --> 45:02.604
We retreat.
