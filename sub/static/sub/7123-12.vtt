00:39.606 --> 00:42.131
What's up?

00:42.208 --> 00:44.039
Nothing. I don't know.

00:49.949 --> 00:51.473
If anybody wants some tea,

00:51.551 --> 00:54.042
it'll be ready
in a few minutes.

00:56.623 --> 00:58.682
Aah!

00:58.758 --> 01:01.318
Evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil,
evil, evil, evil, evil.

01:01.394 --> 01:02.383
Evil!

01:02.462 --> 01:04.123
Whoa! Flame King!

01:04.197 --> 01:05.858
Father!

01:05.932 --> 01:07.422
Oh. Uh, uh, I'm sorry.

01:07.500 --> 01:09.263
I-I thought my daughter
was alone.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.872
I'll just be going.

01:12.939 --> 01:14.998
Uh, nice teapot.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.702
Ew.

01:16.776 --> 01:17.743
What was that?

01:17.811 --> 01:20.974
He was saying, "evil, evil, evil,"
over and over again.

01:21.047 --> 01:22.071
Yeah, I-I heard.

01:22.148 --> 01:24.639
Oh, I wasn't sure if you heard,
'cause he was whispering.

01:24.717 --> 01:26.184
Yeah. I heard.

01:26.252 --> 01:27.742
Ugh. He's so annoying.

01:27.821 --> 01:29.220
I was just trying
to help!

01:29.289 --> 01:31.484
Oh, no.
Not you Jake... my dad.

01:31.558 --> 01:33.651
I always catch him whispering
stuff into my ear

01:33.726 --> 01:35.557
while I'm not
paying attention.

01:35.628 --> 01:37.391
He keeps saying I'm evil.

01:37.464 --> 01:39.227
Whoa.

01:39.299 --> 01:41.563
You best not be believing
that whack bunk.

01:41.634 --> 01:44.000
He's trying to make your life bad
so you'll think you're evil.

01:44.070 --> 01:45.697
But you're really not!

01:45.772 --> 01:47.603
How can I know for sure?

01:47.674 --> 01:49.505
- Dungeons.
- What?

01:49.576 --> 01:51.567
Let's go have a good time
in a dungeon or something.

01:51.644 --> 01:53.942
That <i>always</i> clears my head
and reminds me of what's what.

01:54.013 --> 01:55.776
And...
that'll make me good?

01:55.849 --> 01:58.215
No. That'll show you
not to worry so much,

01:58.284 --> 02:01.481
'cause you're already
good... in here.

02:03.223 --> 02:05.384
Okay. Yeah! Let's do it!

02:05.458 --> 02:07.187
- Dungeons!
- Dungeons!

02:07.260 --> 02:09.990
Chamomile tea.

02:28.081 --> 02:30.481
Is this how you look
for a dungeon?

02:30.550 --> 02:32.313
Ye-e-e-ah.

02:32.385 --> 02:34.376
A lot of times,
the entrances are hidden,

02:34.454 --> 02:36.445
so you got to look
under rocks and stuff

02:36.523 --> 02:38.957
for a secret switch.

02:43.630 --> 02:46.463
Sometimes it takes a while.
Hmm.

02:46.533 --> 02:49.001
I'll just use my heat sense.

02:52.071 --> 02:54.505
That tree over there
is not made of wood.

02:54.574 --> 02:58.066
Really?
Ha ha! Yes!

03:02.615 --> 03:03.877
Yeah. Whoo!

03:03.950 --> 03:07.215
Ha ha! Yeah!

03:07.287 --> 03:08.618
Ooh! Gauntlet!

03:09.656 --> 03:12.090
Thanks for taking me out,
Finn.

03:12.158 --> 03:13.420
No prob, Bob.

03:13.493 --> 03:14.858
Light this for me, will ya?

03:14.928 --> 03:16.327
Oh, sure.

03:16.396 --> 03:18.887
Uh, do we need a torch?
I'm sort of made of fire.

03:18.965 --> 03:20.057
Oh.

03:20.133 --> 03:22.966
Well, I guess torches are just
cool for dungeons, you know?

03:23.036 --> 03:25.129
Oh. Okay.

03:25.205 --> 03:29.141
Yeah, I'd like to hang
onto it.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.700
Boy, this place is creepy.

03:31.778 --> 03:34.713
Really? I feel like
it's trying too hard.

03:34.781 --> 03:35.770
Gold piece!

03:35.848 --> 03:37.975
Oh, you mean, like,
with all the skulls?

03:38.051 --> 03:40.178
- Whoa. Whoa.
- What?

03:40.253 --> 03:42.016
Hey!

03:42.088 --> 03:43.214
What are you doing here?

03:43.289 --> 03:44.620
Burning you alive!

03:44.691 --> 03:46.249
No. No. Wait a sec.

03:46.326 --> 03:47.850
Sorry... one second.
- Sure.

03:47.927 --> 03:50.293
He might have important
loot on him,

03:50.363 --> 03:52.058
so we don't want to
just burn him up.

03:52.131 --> 03:54.361
Plus, it's a little cruel,
even for an evil guy.

03:54.434 --> 03:55.696
Check this out.

03:55.768 --> 03:58.100
You're gonna surrender!

04:05.745 --> 04:06.939
Okay. Okay. I surrender.

04:07.013 --> 04:08.947
I shall grant thee clemency...

04:09.015 --> 04:10.880
if you do the splits.

04:10.950 --> 04:12.212
Do the splits!

04:12.285 --> 04:14.446
I-I can... I can't do
the s-splits.

04:14.520 --> 04:17.488
Do the splits, thou
milk-livered maggot pie!

04:17.557 --> 04:19.024
Okay. Okay.

04:19.091 --> 04:22.687
Okay.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.753
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow,
ow, ow, ow.

04:24.831 --> 04:26.423
See? A lot of times

04:26.499 --> 04:28.194
you can overpower
these guys with confidence.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.098
Neat.

04:29.168 --> 04:30.999
Got any loot on ya?

04:31.070 --> 04:33.061
Just this map.
It'll... it'll help you.

04:33.139 --> 04:35.130
Ha! See?
This would have been burned.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.732
Yeah... no, that makes sense.

04:36.809 --> 04:38.640
- What else ya got?
- A-a-a-a-aah!

04:38.711 --> 04:40.269
There's a treasure chest
in the corner.

04:40.346 --> 04:41.176
Please stop yelling.

04:41.247 --> 04:43.112
I knew it.

04:43.182 --> 04:45.673
Aw! Cram it to the butternuts...
it's locked!

04:45.752 --> 04:47.447
I don't know
where the key is!

04:47.520 --> 04:48.452
Please don't yell!

04:48.521 --> 04:49.886
All right.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.355
We can come back
to that later.

04:51.424 --> 04:52.550
Hey, are you having fun?

04:52.625 --> 04:53.887
Uh-huh.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.894
I... I'll just stay here.

04:55.962 --> 04:58.123
Race you to the next monster!

04:58.197 --> 05:00.062
Whoa! Whoa!

05:00.133 --> 05:01.566
What?

05:01.634 --> 05:03.727
Well, that's not how you do
things in a dungeon.

05:03.803 --> 05:05.794
You gotta sneak.
- Sneak?

05:05.872 --> 05:08.170
Like this.

05:13.212 --> 05:15.976
And you gotta look around.

05:16.049 --> 05:18.381
Tah, tah, tah. Tah. Tah.

05:26.492 --> 05:28.483
Okay, this guy is too big
to intimidate,

05:28.561 --> 05:30.495
but I have a plan.

05:30.563 --> 05:32.690
First, you shoot some fire
at that rope.

05:32.765 --> 05:35.529
The chandelier falls,
distracts the monster.

05:35.601 --> 05:37.569
We run in...
element of surprise.

05:37.637 --> 05:39.264
- Wow.
- You ready?

05:39.339 --> 05:40.328
Yeah.

05:40.406 --> 05:42.271
Before we go in,
how good are you

05:42.342 --> 05:43.934
at quietly throwing
a tiny bit of fire?

05:44.010 --> 05:44.908
Uh, what?

05:44.977 --> 05:46.808
Like on a scale of one
to a hundred,

05:46.879 --> 05:48.540
how good are you
at quietly throwing

05:48.614 --> 05:50.445
a tiny bit of fire
at a rope 50 feet away?

05:50.516 --> 05:51.505
Uh...

05:51.584 --> 05:53.484
Scale of one to a
hundred.

05:53.553 --> 05:55.248
- 42.
- 42!

05:55.321 --> 05:57.221
Well, I don't know.
I never rated myself.

05:57.290 --> 05:59.451
No, that's cool.
That's cool.

05:59.525 --> 06:02.619
Just try and hit that rope.

06:12.939 --> 06:14.770
Hmm.

06:15.742 --> 06:17.835
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm good.

06:17.910 --> 06:19.878
- It's a hologram.
- Oh. Neat.

06:19.946 --> 06:21.607
So, uh,
should we keep going?

06:21.681 --> 06:22.705
Yeah.

06:22.782 --> 06:24.443
Although, it <i>does</i> raise
the question...

06:24.517 --> 06:26.178
why would someone go
through the trouble

06:26.252 --> 06:28.243
of setting up a hologram...

06:28.321 --> 06:32.223
unless they've hidden something
in this room?

06:41.934 --> 06:43.629
Hey! Wake up!

06:43.703 --> 06:45.261
I was meditating.

06:45.338 --> 06:47.135
Look what I fo-o-und.

06:47.206 --> 06:48.867
A key.

06:48.941 --> 06:50.306
We have to go back?

06:50.376 --> 06:52.367
We don't <i>have</i> to...
we <i>get</i> to.

06:52.445 --> 06:55.642

08:24.070 --> 08:26.971
Well, you keep wanting me

08:27.039 --> 08:29.132
but I don't like doing things
your way.

08:29.208 --> 08:30.732
Is that because I <i>am</i> evil?

08:30.810 --> 08:33.472
What?
No way. That's... no!

08:33.546 --> 08:36.344
Uh... hey, you know what?
Let's do things your way.

08:36.414 --> 08:37.972
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:38.049 --> 08:41.042
I've been acting
an uncouth lout, milady.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.054
Okay.
So there's a door over there.

08:43.121 --> 08:45.147
What do you want to do?

08:45.224 --> 08:47.385
I... burn it down.

08:51.964 --> 08:53.659
Okay. Yeah.
That worked.

08:53.733 --> 08:55.724
Now what do you do?

well, you know, it...

10:02.702 --> 10:04.101

to burn me alive.

10:37.803 --> 10:39.395
No way.

10:39.472 --> 10:42.999
I'd never do that
to my boyfriend.

10:43.075 --> 10:44.736
Thanks, Finn.

dungeons?

11:00.026 --> 11:02.017

11:02.094 --> 11:03.755
a farmers' market.

11:03.829 --> 11:05.694
