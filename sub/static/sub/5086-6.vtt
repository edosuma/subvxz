WEBVTT

00:06.133 --> 00:07.433
Mom, can you talk?

00:07.467 --> 00:08.767
Jeff? What's up?

00:08.800 --> 00:10.200
Sorry to bother you at
work, but --

00:10.233 --> 00:12.833
No honey, no bother.
What's going on?

00:12.867 --> 00:16.100
They're evacuating the
school and they didn't say why.

00:16.133 --> 00:18.100
Have you heard anything?
Seen anything?

00:18.133 --> 00:20.467
No, but I can tell by the
look on Ms. Harrison's face.

00:20.500 --> 00:22.500
It's bad.

00:22.533 --> 00:25.867
Okay honey, I understand.
Stay calm, follow the procedure.

00:25.900 --> 00:28.367
Crestview High School, hostage
situation, uniforms responding.

00:28.400 --> 00:29.400
We've got it.

00:29.433 --> 00:32.633
We're on our way Jeff, okay?
We'll be right there.

00:32.733 --> 00:34.733
Jeff, let's go!

00:36.367 --> 00:39.967
We've followed all procedures,
everyone's been accounted for.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.467
Sudents and faculty,
and they have exited safely.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.833
And of course that includes all
of yours, Detective McLean.

00:44.867 --> 00:47.100
Thank you, my husband's on
his way to pick them up.

00:47.133 --> 00:48.333
You're sure only the
instigating student

00:48.367 --> 00:49.600
is still in
the classroom?

00:49.633 --> 00:51.800
Yes.
Trevor Wynn. Junior.

00:51.833 --> 00:54.600
He let the other students
and the teacher go.

00:54.633 --> 00:57.000
It's his AP
physics class.

00:57.033 --> 00:58.467
Mr. Witherspoon's
AP physics?

00:58.500 --> 00:59.800
Yes.

00:59.833 --> 01:02.267
Your daughter Rachel
is in that section.

01:02.600 --> 01:03.667
Trevor.

01:03.700 --> 01:07.067
Yes, they were taking a
practice exam and Trevor had

01:07.067 --> 01:08.267
some sort of breakdown.

01:08.300 --> 01:09.433
Can you be
more specific?

01:09.467 --> 01:11.767
My understanding is he was
yelling at the students,

01:11.800 --> 01:13.900
threatening them, and
it escalated from there.

01:13.933 --> 01:17.067
Randall! These are
police detectives.

01:17.100 --> 01:19.067
Mr. Witherspoon insisted
on remaining with Trevor

01:19.100 --> 01:20.167
until you both arrived.

01:20.200 --> 01:21.400
You're injured.

01:21.433 --> 01:24.267
Trevor was throwing things
and I failed to duck.

01:24.300 --> 01:27.467
I tried to stay at his side,
but he forced me out.

01:27.500 --> 01:29.300
I'm Detective McLean,
Detective Stewart.

01:29.333 --> 01:31.467
I'm Rachel's mom, we
met at the open house...

01:31.500 --> 01:34.567
Of course I'm so sorry, I have
no idea what's going on here.

01:34.600 --> 01:36.233
I've never seen this
kind of behavior before.

01:36.267 --> 01:37.467
Tell me about
the student.

01:37.500 --> 01:40.133
He's a great kid, he's quiet.
This is atypical behavior.

01:40.167 --> 01:41.567
I have no idea
what triggered this.

01:41.600 --> 01:42.800
I don't want
anyone getting hurt.

01:42.833 --> 01:44.333
Neither do we.

01:44.367 --> 01:45.767
You're all gonna burn!

01:45.800 --> 01:47.400
We'll take it from here.

01:47.433 --> 01:50.500
Take Mr. Witherspoon to the
paramedic team out front.

01:51.833 --> 01:54.433
Trevor!

01:54.467 --> 01:57.833
Trevor, I'm Detective
McLean, Crestview PD.

01:57.867 --> 02:01.500
I'm also Rachel's mom. We met
at the science fair last year.

02:01.533 --> 02:05.933
Your project was about
sustainable energy, wasn't it?

02:07.133 --> 02:10.067
I'm here with my
partner, Detective Stewart.

02:10.067 --> 02:12.067
We need to come in
and talk to you.

02:12.067 --> 02:15.300
You want to burn?

02:17.300 --> 02:22.067
Trevor, the only way this
gets better is if we come in.

02:22.067 --> 02:23.533
It can't get better.

02:23.567 --> 02:28.633
It can, Trevor.
Trevor, let us in.

02:28.667 --> 02:33.067
Only you.
And no guns.

02:36.467 --> 02:39.500
Okay.

02:46.067 --> 02:48.500
I'm coming in.

02:55.767 --> 02:57.433
Lock it!

03:00.433 --> 03:02.600
Don't touch that!
The snipers will get me!

03:02.633 --> 03:03.533
Get away from the door!

03:03.567 --> 03:05.867
Trevor, there
are no snipers.

03:05.900 --> 03:09.267
Don't lie to me!
I know they're out there!

03:14.400 --> 03:21.900
Trevor, I need you to put down
the lamp and the alcohol.

03:21.933 --> 03:26.600
This is all a joke!
None of it matters!

03:26.633 --> 03:30.267
No, no. Life matters.
You matter.

03:30.300 --> 03:36.233
They make you say that.
Program you. Force you.

03:36.267 --> 03:39.900
No, Trevor, I believe it.

03:39.933 --> 03:42.200
I know you're feeling like
you're out of control right now,

03:42.233 --> 03:45.233
but if you let me,
I can help fix that.

03:45.267 --> 03:48.867
We just need to stop.
Right now Trevor, put that --

03:48.900 --> 03:53.433
But we can't stop. Ever. We're
just random balls of energy,

03:53.467 --> 03:56.100
rocketing around and colliding
and spinning faster and faster

03:56.133 --> 03:59.167
until we burst into flames.

04:01.467 --> 04:06.400
No, no Trevor, don't!
Trevor!

04:09.067 --> 04:14.100
Let's burn together.

04:14.133 --> 04:19.267
My heart! So fast.
Gonna explode.

04:19.300 --> 04:22.067
No, no, that's just the
adrenaline Trevor, okay?

04:22.067 --> 04:23.333
Just put down the lamp.

04:23.367 --> 04:24.333
No, I --

04:24.367 --> 04:27.300
Trevor... Trevor!

04:27.333 --> 04:34.133
Devin! Devin!
Get in here.

04:42.567 --> 04:45.533
Paramedics! Now!

04:56.367 --> 04:59.567
Pooja says they took Trevor
to the hospital, but Alexis says

04:59.600 --> 05:02.900
Aunt Allison took him to jail,
and Kyle says --

05:02.933 --> 05:06.433
Just stop! Okay?

05:06.467 --> 05:08.500
I know you're freaked because
you were in there with him,

05:08.533 --> 05:11.833
but I'm just trying to
figure out what's happening.

05:11.867 --> 05:14.167
Hey you guys, I
just heard from Mom.

05:14.200 --> 05:16.067
Trevor's on his way
to the hospital.

05:16.067 --> 05:19.867
Mom and Devin are fine.
How's it going in here?

05:21.867 --> 05:23.367
Let's make some lunch.

05:23.400 --> 05:25.533
Make everybody feel better,
all right?

05:25.567 --> 05:28.800
Connor says Trevor stood on
his desk and started screaming

05:28.833 --> 05:35.667
in the middle of the
test. Is that true?

05:35.700 --> 05:40.100
If I wanted to talk about
it, it wouldn't be with you.

05:40.133 --> 05:42.500
I'm not hungry.

05:45.067 --> 05:48.667
Make some lunch.
I'll get it.

05:53.067 --> 05:54.667
Hi, Mr. McLean.

05:54.700 --> 05:55.700
Hello...?

05:55.733 --> 05:56.967
Dana.
Rasmussen.

05:57.067 --> 05:58.867
Dana Rasmussen,
hello.

05:58.900 --> 06:01.733
Which member of my household
are you here to see?

06:01.767 --> 06:03.233
I'm on the track team
with Cameron.

06:03.267 --> 06:05.467
I run the girls' hundred
and he runs the boys.

06:05.500 --> 06:07.633
He's such a great addition
to the team, because --

06:07.667 --> 06:12.167
Dana, hey!

06:12.200 --> 06:16.833
Hey Cameron.

06:16.867 --> 06:19.400
So, what's up?

06:19.433 --> 06:22.400
This stuff with Trevor
has got me really stressed

06:22.433 --> 06:24.167
and usually when I'm
stressed at school,

06:24.200 --> 06:26.600
by the end of track practice,
I'm so tired that I feel better,

06:26.633 --> 06:28.567
but practice was
cancelled today because of the

06:28.600 --> 06:31.500
whole evacuation deal, I
was thinking I'd go for a run on

06:31.533 --> 06:35.267
my own, but then I thought maybe
you'd like to come with me.

06:35.300 --> 06:38.433
Maybe get your mind
off it too. Maybe?

06:38.467 --> 06:40.233
Go on a run, together?

06:40.267 --> 06:44.167
I mean if you want
to, or whatever.

06:46.333 --> 06:51.800
Okay, sounds like fun.
Give me a sec to get changed.

06:59.300 --> 07:01.067
The doctor said
it's difficult

07:01.067 --> 07:03.333
to make a prognosis
at this time.

07:03.367 --> 07:05.533
We're so sorry,
Mr. Wynn.

07:05.567 --> 07:10.400
The doctor told us
Trevor had a heart attack.

07:10.433 --> 07:14.567
Caused by an overdose
of dextroamphetamine.

07:14.600 --> 07:19.067
Dextroamphetamine?
Does Trevor have ADHD?

07:19.067 --> 07:22.133
No. Why?

07:22.167 --> 07:24.467
That's what it's
usually prescribed for.

07:24.500 --> 07:25.933
But if you don't
have the condition,

07:25.967 --> 07:29.067
the body can be
overstimulated and react badly.

07:29.067 --> 07:31.400
There's been a mistake.

07:31.433 --> 07:32.933
Trevor has a heart murmur,

07:32.967 --> 07:35.900
so he would never take
anything like that.

07:35.933 --> 07:39.267
He can't even have caffeine.

07:39.300 --> 07:42.533
Mr. and Mrs. Wynn,
I mean no disrespect,

07:42.567 --> 07:46.800
I have teenagers too,
but this kind of reaction

07:46.833 --> 07:48.933
would indicate
long-term use.

07:48.967 --> 07:52.067
If Trevor took
this, someone made him.

07:52.067 --> 07:58.100
Trevor is a good boy. A
smart boy. He knows better.

07:58.133 --> 08:01.600
He doesn't keep secrets.

08:01.633 --> 08:05.867
Detectives, you have
got to help us find out

08:05.900 --> 08:08.600
what happened
to our son?

08:10.600 --> 08:13.400
We promise you, we will.

08:43.767 --> 08:45.067
Why are you parking?

08:45.067 --> 08:47.167
I'm coming in.
I have work to do.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.533
On Trevor's case?

08:48.567 --> 08:50.233
While we're here?

08:50.267 --> 08:53.633
This'll be a party.

09:05.067 --> 09:06.633
Don't worry, kids.

09:06.667 --> 09:09.667
Cop Mom is here to
shred your cred.

09:09.700 --> 09:11.333
Can't Devin
do this part?

09:11.367 --> 09:13.333
Devin and I are partners,
we work together.

09:13.367 --> 09:15.967
He's meeting me at
Mrs. Dayton's office.

09:16.067 --> 09:19.667
Your social status will survive
my being on campus a day or two.

09:19.700 --> 09:21.300
Two?

09:21.333 --> 09:25.867
Rachel, I have work, you
have class. Let's get going.

09:25.900 --> 09:28.633
Fine but you'll understand
if I don't walk in with you.

09:28.667 --> 09:30.933
Detective.

09:35.467 --> 09:39.167
Trevor has never been in
trouble. He's quiet but

09:39.200 --> 09:42.933
delightful, consistently in
the top 5% of his class.

09:42.967 --> 09:46.433
4.6 GPA, National
Merit finalist,

09:46.467 --> 09:51.667
National Honor Society,
Academic Decathlon captain,

09:51.700 --> 09:53.667
Latin Honor
Society president,

09:53.700 --> 09:55.533
Chess Club president,
and so on.

09:55.567 --> 09:57.133
Busy young man.

09:57.167 --> 10:01.200
Very motivated. Frankly, I don't
know how some of our students

10:01.233 --> 10:04.367
do everything they do. But
top-tier college admissions

10:04.400 --> 10:08.533
have become so competitive,
it's almost a necessity.

10:08.567 --> 10:12.100
This AP Physics class
seems very demanding.

10:12.133 --> 10:14.033
At least it seems that
way at my house.

10:14.067 --> 10:17.200
That's why we're so fortunate
to have Mr. Witherspoon.

10:17.233 --> 10:20.700
He has a gift for
engaging students,

10:20.733 --> 10:22.633
even with such
difficult material.

10:22.667 --> 10:25.500
No history of bad blood between
Trevor and Witherspoon?

10:25.533 --> 10:29.667
No, none at all. In fact, if
Mr. Witherspoon had a fan club,

10:29.700 --> 10:32.700
Trevor would be president
of that as well.

10:34.167 --> 10:38.300
Mrs. Dayton, how prevalent is
drug use here at Crestview?

10:38.333 --> 10:39.833
Mrs. --

10:39.867 --> 10:43.833
Detective McLean, you know we
have a zero-tolerance policy.

10:43.867 --> 10:49.233
I do. How prevalent
is the drug use here?

10:49.267 --> 10:52.933
We're specifically looking
at prescription drug abuse.

10:52.967 --> 10:54.633
Is that what you think
happened with Trevor?

10:54.667 --> 10:57.667
That's our current
path of investigation.

10:57.700 --> 11:00.233
We haven't had any
documented cases

11:00.267 --> 11:02.167
of prescription
drug abuse.

11:02.200 --> 11:03.800
How about undocumented?

11:03.833 --> 11:07.167
We've done some training
on how to look for signs.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.733
Nationally,
it's a very common problem,

11:09.767 --> 11:12.633
especially among highly
motivated students.

11:12.667 --> 11:14.733
Like Trevor.

11:16.067 --> 11:19.233
Look, we care deeply
about our students,

11:19.267 --> 11:21.200
and we take these
matters very seriously.

11:21.233 --> 11:23.600
Then you won't mind giving
us a list of the students

11:23.633 --> 11:27.567
permitted to have prescription
medication with them on campus.

11:27.600 --> 11:30.267
I'll have to speak
with the Superintendent.

11:30.300 --> 11:32.800
There are privacy
rights involved.

11:32.833 --> 11:36.067
We might need to get
a warrant involved.

11:37.467 --> 11:39.633
I'll call as
soon as you leave.

11:39.667 --> 11:41.300
Thank you for
your cooperation.

11:41.333 --> 11:43.433
Not at all.

11:46.300 --> 11:49.833
I couldn't sleep last night,
I was so worried about Trevor.

11:49.867 --> 11:52.233
I care about all my students.
It's impossible not to.

11:52.267 --> 11:55.400
I watch them come here
every day and work so hard.

11:55.433 --> 11:57.967
Rachel, for example,
she's one of my most

11:58.067 --> 11:59.633
dedicated students.

11:59.667 --> 12:02.100
Thank you,
that's nice to hear.

12:02.133 --> 12:04.233
Are you aware of any students
taking stimulants

12:04.267 --> 12:05.833
to help them study?

12:05.867 --> 12:12.667
I know statistically that
stimulant abuse is on the rise

12:12.700 --> 12:15.900
in academic settings, but my
kids know the inherent dangers

12:15.933 --> 12:19.600
of that kind of behavior.
They're just too smart.

12:19.633 --> 12:21.233
They're not the type.

12:21.267 --> 12:24.567
Then who is the type?

12:24.600 --> 12:26.833
I'm not making judgments,
I'm just saying,

12:26.867 --> 12:30.067
you get to know
your kids.

12:30.067 --> 12:32.467
We'd like to talk
to some of them.

12:36.400 --> 12:37.933
I'm in Trevor's phone?

12:37.967 --> 12:39.067
Yes.

12:39.100 --> 12:40.233
We're talking to
your whole class,

12:40.267 --> 12:43.133
but we want to know who his
friends are outside of class.

12:43.167 --> 12:45.867
I'm not sure
Trevor has friends.

12:45.900 --> 12:47.933
So you don't
see him socially?

12:47.967 --> 12:50.200
Look, I told you
everything I know at home.

12:50.233 --> 12:51.833
This is part of the
official investigation.

12:51.867 --> 12:56.367
We need your comments as
part of the official record.

12:56.400 --> 12:59.100
I don't think Trevor
has a social life.

12:59.133 --> 13:02.133
Did you ever see Trevor
taking drugs of any kind?

13:02.167 --> 13:04.533
He's such a straight arrow,
he'd snap if he even thought

13:04.567 --> 13:06.067
about doing anything wrong.

13:06.067 --> 13:08.200
So you never saw
Trevor in an altered state?

13:08.233 --> 13:11.133
Except for when he
jumped on the desk yesterday?

13:11.167 --> 13:12.633
Absolutely not.

13:12.667 --> 13:14.833
Your name was one of
the few in his phone.

13:14.867 --> 13:17.067
Anyone else he hangs out
with we should know about?

13:17.067 --> 13:19.967
Nope.
Total lone wolf.

13:20.067 --> 13:23.067
I think I saw him talking to
Jake Perkins once or twice.

13:23.067 --> 13:24.600
But Jake's the only one.

13:24.633 --> 13:26.100
Is Jake in your
Physics class?

13:26.133 --> 13:29.867
Oh no, he's not
really an AP kind of guy.

13:29.900 --> 13:33.400
I mean he's a jock.
Track star?

13:33.433 --> 13:34.667
Meaning?

13:34.700 --> 13:36.767
Just can't imagine
what the two of them

13:36.800 --> 13:38.633
would have
to talk about.

13:38.667 --> 13:41.200
Are we done?

13:57.800 --> 14:00.233
Tracey, hey...

14:00.267 --> 14:02.833
So, that was weird.

14:02.867 --> 14:05.700
Oh, you mean interrogation
isn't part of your normal day?

14:05.733 --> 14:08.167
I can't imagine what
it's like in your house.

14:08.200 --> 14:11.133
Do you have any fun?

14:11.167 --> 14:14.167
So, Mr. Witherspoon
is postponing the quiz,

14:14.200 --> 14:18.467
but I was still hoping we could
go over the vector worksheet?

14:18.500 --> 14:25.700
Oh, Rachel, I feel terrible.
I thought I texted you.

14:25.733 --> 14:28.933
Study group
met last night.

14:28.967 --> 14:29.900
Really?

14:29.933 --> 14:31.967
When you didn't show,
we just assumed your mom

14:32.067 --> 14:34.700
had you on lockdown.

14:43.600 --> 14:47.333
Jeff, hey!
Come here for a sec?

14:47.367 --> 14:50.967
So this is her son,
I'm just the niece.

14:51.067 --> 14:53.767
Do that joke thing
from this morning.

14:53.800 --> 15:00.300
You want a joke,
check out this lunch.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.833
See what I mean?

15:22.067 --> 15:23.800
Jake Perkins?

15:23.833 --> 15:25.433
Yeah?

15:25.467 --> 15:29.600
Detective McLean, Detective
Stewart, Crestview PD.

15:29.633 --> 15:32.767
I've seen you at track.
You're Cameron Olson's...?

15:32.800 --> 15:35.133
Aunt.

15:35.167 --> 15:36.767
Nice to meet you.

15:36.800 --> 15:40.100
Trevor Wynn.
You know him, right?

15:40.133 --> 15:43.300
Man, everyone knows
Trevor. Now.

15:43.333 --> 15:45.200
He's the kid that flipped
out yesterday

15:45.233 --> 15:46.633
and got us all early
dismissal.

15:46.667 --> 15:49.067
We heard you two've
been hanging out recently.

15:49.067 --> 15:53.467
Me and Trevor? No way.
Somebody's tripping.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.233
Maybe he was tutoring you?

15:55.267 --> 15:58.933
I don't need a tutor.

15:58.967 --> 16:00.733
Okay, look,
I have a tutor.

16:00.767 --> 16:03.267
But it's some nailbiter from
Lakeside my parents hired.

16:03.300 --> 16:06.767
Not Trevor Wynn. I've never
even talked to that freak.

16:06.800 --> 16:11.067
So you never talked about
scoring dextroamphetamines?

16:11.100 --> 16:12.767
ADHD medication?

16:12.800 --> 16:14.100
I'm not ADHD.

16:14.133 --> 16:17.267
People take it for other
reasons, illegal reasons.

16:17.300 --> 16:19.267
Can I take a look
in your backpack?

16:19.300 --> 16:21.800
Go ahead.

16:23.267 --> 16:25.600
You seem like a
connected guy.

16:25.633 --> 16:27.567
So, who's the best source
on campus for pills?

16:27.600 --> 16:30.233
You're not listening to me.
I don't know anything

16:30.267 --> 16:33.933
about pills or
losers, all right?

16:33.967 --> 16:39.333
Oh is that right? Look
at this. How about that?

16:39.367 --> 16:40.567
You've got
enough for everyone.

16:40.600 --> 16:45.133
That's not mine...
I'm serious!

16:47.600 --> 16:52.800
I know...
okay. Bye.

16:52.833 --> 16:54.433
My mom says I'm not
to say anything

16:54.467 --> 16:55.867
until she meets us
at the station.

16:55.900 --> 16:57.733
That's your right.
We told you that.

16:57.767 --> 17:00.067
She's like this big-shot
lawyer. I wouldn't mess

17:00.067 --> 17:01.967
with her if I
were you. Or me.

17:02.067 --> 17:03.600
Jake, we're not
messing with you.

17:03.633 --> 17:07.133
Understand: we're confused.
You don't have a prescription,

17:07.167 --> 17:10.267
yet you've got a lot of pills.
Enough that we could bust you

17:10.300 --> 17:12.267
on possession and
intent to distribute.

17:12.300 --> 17:13.600
We're just
sorting it out.

17:13.633 --> 17:16.167
That's why we're going
down to the station to talk.

17:16.200 --> 17:18.567
With your mom and
maybe our lieutenant.

17:18.600 --> 17:22.233
I remember when I was
in high school. I had to keep

17:22.267 --> 17:25.267
my grades up so I wouldn't get
kicked off the football team.

17:25.300 --> 17:27.167
Maybe you and your
friends from track are going

17:27.200 --> 17:28.067
through the same thing?

17:28.100 --> 17:30.433
No! Look,
the pills aren't mine!

17:30.467 --> 17:32.733
You know who you should
be talking to?

17:32.767 --> 17:33.933
Your nephew, Cameron.

17:33.967 --> 17:35.933
That kid hates me, I didn't
do anything to him.

17:35.967 --> 17:38.133
We know what it was
like at his old school,

17:38.167 --> 17:40.333
I bet he's the one who
put those in my bag.

17:40.367 --> 17:42.833
For someone who wasn't going
to talk until we got to the

17:42.867 --> 17:46.233
station, you suddenly have
a lot to say, Jake.

17:58.533 --> 18:03.100
Hey, the run yesterday
was a great idea.

18:03.133 --> 18:06.267
Wanna go again today? We
could run by the lake --

18:06.300 --> 18:08.933
Did you hear what your
aunt did to Jake?

18:08.967 --> 18:10.233
Jake Perkins?

18:10.267 --> 18:13.467
She dragged him out of here
like some kind of criminal.

18:13.500 --> 18:15.433
Did you tell
her to do that?

18:15.467 --> 18:18.400
My aunt doesn't listen when
I ask her to pass the salt.

18:18.433 --> 18:21.500
This doesn't come from me.

18:23.300 --> 18:25.567
I gotta go.

18:25.600 --> 18:28.167
Okay, I'll see
you at practice.

18:28.200 --> 18:30.533
Yeah.

18:30.567 --> 18:31.500
Cameron.

18:31.533 --> 18:32.733
I got track practice.

18:32.767 --> 18:34.767
Yeah, and I have
some questions.

18:34.800 --> 18:36.400
About pills and
the track team.

18:36.433 --> 18:38.067
Are you serious?

18:38.100 --> 18:40.233
This day just gets
better and better.

18:40.267 --> 18:41.333
Doesn't it?

18:41.367 --> 18:43.567
We just questioned Jake
Perkins because he had a stash

18:43.600 --> 18:45.067
of pills in his backpack.

18:45.067 --> 18:46.967
And you know the
defense he's sticking to?

18:47.067 --> 18:48.133
You planted them there.

18:48.167 --> 18:49.267
And you believe him?

18:49.300 --> 18:50.367
I said I have questions.

18:50.400 --> 18:53.067
You always have questions!
And they're always about me!

18:53.067 --> 18:54.200
Detective!

18:54.233 --> 18:56.633
I cannot have this disruption
occurring in the hallway.

18:56.667 --> 18:58.833
This is part of our
investigation, Mrs. Dayton.

18:58.867 --> 19:00.733
I just got off the phone
with the Superintendent.

19:00.767 --> 19:02.567
Who is on the phone
with your lieutenant.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.567
The agreement has been made
that if this investigation

19:04.600 --> 19:08.233
must continue, it
will do so off-site.

19:08.267 --> 19:09.433
Lieutenant?

19:09.467 --> 19:13.167
We're working for the
same goal, Mrs. Dayton.

19:13.200 --> 19:15.533
Lieutenant needs to see us.

19:15.567 --> 19:18.233
Thank you for your
cooperation, Mrs. Dayton.

19:18.267 --> 19:20.933
I'll see you
after practice.

19:37.233 --> 19:40.200
I don't know how
you guys do it.

19:40.233 --> 19:41.667
Serrated knife.

19:41.700 --> 19:43.767
That's not what I meant.

19:43.800 --> 19:46.267
We're all gonna need a new
school by the end of this week.

19:46.300 --> 19:48.067
At least she
didn't charge Jake.

19:48.067 --> 19:49.600
Yeah and that
was a mistake too.

19:49.633 --> 19:51.900
She should've locked him up
for being a lying dirtball.

19:51.933 --> 19:56.567
I'm just glad I'm an Olson.
Sucks to be a McLean right now.

20:12.433 --> 20:14.800
Pleasant day at school?

20:14.833 --> 20:17.767
Oh I love high school. The
cool kids don't talk to you,

20:17.800 --> 20:20.733
the teachers don't
trust you, it's a blast.

20:20.767 --> 20:24.600
Glad we met in college.

20:24.633 --> 20:27.233
I shouldn't have gotten
into it with Cameron.

20:27.267 --> 20:30.267
You had to ask him
about the pills.

20:30.300 --> 20:33.400
Could've waited until you got
home, but you had to ask.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.600
I was following the
line of investigation.

20:35.633 --> 20:37.867
I also didn't want it to look
like I was playing favorites.

20:37.900 --> 20:40.033
But he ended up feeling like
he's #1 on your list

20:40.067 --> 20:41.400
of usual suspects.

20:41.433 --> 20:44.733
Which is the last
thing I wanted.

20:44.767 --> 20:47.500
Are sure now that he had
nothing to do with the pills?

20:47.533 --> 20:48.933
I am.

20:48.967 --> 20:49.967
Great.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.400
I think if somebody framed
Jake, it wasn't Cameron.

20:52.433 --> 20:55.167
But now Cam's upset,
I don't know how to fix it.

20:55.200 --> 20:57.067
Have you tried having a
conversation with him

20:57.100 --> 20:58.067
since you got home?

20:58.100 --> 20:59.867
Does banging your head
against a wall qualify

20:59.900 --> 21:01.333
as trying to climb it?

21:01.367 --> 21:03.200
The boy does know
how to lock down.

21:03.233 --> 21:05.367
My brother taught him well.

21:05.400 --> 21:07.933
So teach him something else.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.067
What?

21:09.067 --> 21:11.467
Baby, they respect what you
do, you know they do.

21:11.500 --> 21:14.067
But they need to know we respect
their space outside the house.

21:14.067 --> 21:16.067
Wait, so now I'm
disrespecting them?

21:16.067 --> 21:19.533
That's not what I said. But
making it clearer that we

21:19.567 --> 21:21.767
respect what they're
going through --

21:21.800 --> 21:23.233
I'm just trying
to do my job.

21:23.267 --> 21:24.767
And they're
exposed nerves,

21:24.800 --> 21:26.733
they're trying to
survive high school.

21:26.767 --> 21:28.600
If I worry about everyone's
feelings all the time,

21:28.633 --> 21:31.333
I'd never
get anything done.

21:31.367 --> 21:35.067
Don't I know it.

21:35.067 --> 21:36.167
I love you.

21:36.200 --> 21:38.200
You're picking a fight with me,
that's what you're doing.

21:38.233 --> 21:39.767
No! You've got a gun.

21:39.800 --> 21:42.300
Sassafras!
Just cook the kebabs.

21:47.767 --> 21:50.100
Okay, gang, there are some
things I'd like to clear up

21:50.133 --> 21:53.133
about my being at school.

21:58.633 --> 21:59.700
Guys, you know the rules.

21:59.733 --> 22:02.267
There's no phones at the
dinner table.

22:04.533 --> 22:07.567
Dad, something crazy
must be happening.

22:09.133 --> 22:11.500
All right Rachel go ahead,
you can check yours.

22:13.233 --> 22:17.167
Wait, that's my phone.

22:22.300 --> 22:25.333
Honey?

22:26.433 --> 22:29.833
Trevor Wynn died.

22:40.800 --> 22:43.200
What a tragic waste.

22:43.233 --> 22:45.600
And that means Trevor's
supplier, whoever they are,

22:45.633 --> 22:48.700
is looking at
negligent homicide.

22:48.733 --> 22:51.800
Maybe we bring Jake
back in, press him harder?

22:51.833 --> 22:54.700
Jake let us go through his bag,
he's kept his story consistent,

22:54.733 --> 22:57.833
even after his mom came
around and leaned on him.

22:57.867 --> 23:01.567
Jake doesn't know a thing.
Somebody else set him up.

23:01.600 --> 23:03.733
And it wasn't Cameron.

23:03.767 --> 23:06.100
If Jake always parks his
backpack on top of the lockers,

23:06.133 --> 23:08.700
it could be anybody.
Wouldn't take more than a minute

23:08.733 --> 23:11.267
for a kid to slip a
baggie in and move on.

23:11.300 --> 23:12.533
Detectives?

23:14.333 --> 23:16.900
Detectives, I'm
sorry to interrupt.

23:16.933 --> 23:18.500
No, no interruption.

23:18.533 --> 23:20.967
Mr. Wynn, again,
our condolences.

23:21.067 --> 23:24.133
We will find the
party responsible.

23:24.167 --> 23:27.567
I hope this helps.
Trevor's phone.

23:27.600 --> 23:30.600
I found it this
morning, in his jacket.

23:30.633 --> 23:34.533
Thank you.
It will help.

23:34.567 --> 23:41.867
Good. I hope it leads you
to -- I'm sorry, excuse me.

23:44.933 --> 23:48.067
Except we already
examined Trevor's phone.

23:48.100 --> 23:52.500
Looks like he had two.

24:03.433 --> 24:07.400
We should get the day off.
We're all too upset to be here.

24:07.433 --> 24:08.800
You didn't even
know the guy.

24:08.833 --> 24:11.733
Yeah and now
I never will!

24:11.767 --> 24:12.767
Bye, Dad.

24:12.800 --> 24:15.433
See ya!

24:15.467 --> 24:16.867
Bye, Uncle Matt.

24:16.900 --> 24:19.733
Have a good day.

24:28.867 --> 24:31.933
Hey, hold on a sec.

24:31.967 --> 24:34.100
People make bad
choices, Cameron.

24:34.133 --> 24:37.467
Sometimes we can't
figure it out.

24:37.500 --> 24:39.767
Don't let it drag you
down, all right?

24:39.800 --> 24:44.067
Move forward.
And then after school,

24:44.067 --> 24:47.067
blow 'em
off the track.

25:08.067 --> 25:11.067
Just confirmed with Steve in
Narcotics, they're not seeing

25:11.067 --> 25:13.467
dextroamphetamine on
the street right now.

25:13.500 --> 25:16.233
My gut says this is
contained to the high school.

25:16.267 --> 25:20.600
I agree. Look at this. So
supposedly friendless Trevor

25:20.633 --> 25:22.100
had a very special friend.

25:22.133 --> 25:23.833
The second cell?

25:23.867 --> 25:26.167
Almost exclusively
calls to one number.

25:26.200 --> 25:28.233
He called it every
week, at the same time,

25:28.267 --> 25:30.833
and it pinged off the
same tower, every week.

25:30.867 --> 25:32.400
So who was he calling?

25:32.433 --> 25:35.433
Suzie Chang, a senior.

25:35.467 --> 25:37.933
A girlfriend he didn't want
his parents to know about?

25:37.967 --> 25:39.600
Or a dealer?

25:39.633 --> 25:42.800
Let's call Suzie
and find out.

25:42.833 --> 25:45.467
If anybody feels like talking
about Trevor, you can sit down

25:45.500 --> 25:49.100
with a counselor, or a
teacher, myself included.

25:49.133 --> 25:52.067
Don't be shy, okay?
We're here to help.

25:55.467 --> 25:56.867
Thanks, Mr.
Witherspoon.

25:56.900 --> 25:58.667
Of course, Andre.

25:58.700 --> 26:00.867
As if we weren't
depressed enough.

26:00.900 --> 26:03.567
Yeah, no kidding.

26:03.600 --> 26:08.767
Jeff! That's his name,
right? Your funny cousin?

26:08.800 --> 26:10.567
Um... yeah.

26:10.600 --> 26:15.367
We've got room here.
Besides, I could use a laugh.

26:15.400 --> 26:20.367
There's always room at my table
for my favorite, funny cousin.

26:42.067 --> 26:45.400
Suzie, we're very
sorry for your loss.

26:45.433 --> 26:47.900
We know this is
hard to talk about,

26:47.933 --> 26:50.567
we appreciate you and
your dad coming in.

26:50.600 --> 26:52.733
I just want to help.

26:52.767 --> 26:55.267
Where was Trevor getting
his dextroamphetamine?

26:55.300 --> 27:00.267
I don't know. I didn't even
know he was taking it.

27:00.300 --> 27:03.733
If I knew, I
would've made him stop.

27:03.767 --> 27:06.867
I mean, he said sometimes
he needed help to power

27:06.900 --> 27:10.967
through, you know,
like, with all-nighters.

27:11.067 --> 27:14.467
But I thought he was talking
about Red Bull or something.

27:14.500 --> 27:16.733
Not drugs.

27:19.467 --> 27:22.333
How long had you been dating?

27:22.367 --> 27:24.167
Since last semester.

27:24.200 --> 27:27.067
Why didn't Trevor want
anyone to know about it?

27:27.067 --> 27:29.967
He said his
parents would lose it.

27:30.067 --> 27:33.200
He was supposed to focus on
good grades and the things

27:33.233 --> 27:39.300
that look good on college
applications. No social life.

27:39.333 --> 27:44.867
When he got sick, I
didn't want to say anything,

27:44.900 --> 27:48.367
because I didn't want him
to get in trouble.

27:48.400 --> 27:52.567
I never thought
that he would--

27:57.867 --> 28:02.500
Can you tell us about your
calling and meeting schedule?

28:02.533 --> 28:07.067
Trevor would text me
every Tuesday,

28:07.067 --> 28:10.433
around six,
and we'd meet.

28:10.467 --> 28:13.133
Why Tuesdays at six?

28:13.167 --> 28:17.433
That was my study
group for AP Physics.

28:17.467 --> 28:20.767
We'd meet up at a coffee
shop near his house,

28:20.800 --> 28:23.733
so it was easier for him
to slip out and meet.

28:23.767 --> 28:26.800
We'll need the names of all
the people in that group

28:26.833 --> 28:31.433
so we can talk to them,
compare stories.

28:31.467 --> 28:34.533
Do you know where Trevor
was getting the drugs?

28:34.567 --> 28:42.767
I wish I did. And I want to
help. I just want him back.

28:59.700 --> 29:03.500
Where do you want to start
with that study group list?

29:07.167 --> 29:09.933
How about here?

29:09.967 --> 29:13.633
This is Rachel's group?

29:20.233 --> 29:25.067
Hey. Can I talk
to you a minute?

29:27.667 --> 29:29.833
You working on
something new?

29:29.867 --> 29:33.633
Not really.

29:37.200 --> 29:39.800
So, I wanted to ask
you a few questions about

29:39.833 --> 29:42.567
your AP Physics study group.

29:44.900 --> 29:53.400
Rachel? Oh honey, forget my
questions. Just talk to me.

29:53.433 --> 29:58.200
I should've seen it, Mom.
I should've helped Trevor.

29:58.233 --> 29:59.733
Sweetie, it's okay.

29:59.767 --> 30:02.733
I didn't know about the pills,
and I didn't know about

30:02.767 --> 30:05.867
him and Suzie until Andre
started running his mouth today.

30:05.900 --> 30:08.500
And now you need help
and I can't give you any.

30:08.533 --> 30:11.133
I wanted to ask questions
about the study group.

30:11.167 --> 30:14.600
It's okay.
It's okay, honey.

30:16.367 --> 30:19.267
Trevor wasn't in our group.

30:19.300 --> 30:25.067
Suzie said that he used to
sneak out and meet her there.

30:25.100 --> 30:28.133
Oh my god, I
should have known.

30:28.167 --> 30:30.833
I thought Suzie and Tracey
were being all girly-girl,

30:30.867 --> 30:34.067
running off to the bathroom
together, but now I get it.

30:34.100 --> 30:37.833
Queen Tracey was covering
for Suzie and Trevor.

30:37.867 --> 30:39.567
You don't like Tracey?

30:39.600 --> 30:42.767
No, she's a control freak. Study
group used to be almost fun,

30:42.800 --> 30:46.267
until she and Suzie took it
over. Now it's hard labor.

30:46.300 --> 30:49.067
She says we have to be the
best study group, and get the

30:49.100 --> 30:51.800
highest scores on exams. They're
always criticizing people

30:51.833 --> 30:54.400
for not working hard enough,
they got on my case for

30:54.433 --> 30:56.333
wimping out because I
can't pull an all-nighter

30:56.367 --> 30:59.833
and still ace a quiz
the next morning.

31:01.367 --> 31:04.133
But I guess that won't be a
problem anymore, because now

31:04.167 --> 31:07.533
they get together and don't tell
me. And if they know anything

31:07.567 --> 31:09.567
else about Trevor, of
course, they're not

31:09.600 --> 31:11.067
going to tell
me that, either.

31:11.067 --> 31:12.200
Because your mom's a cop,

31:12.233 --> 31:14.200
and they're worried
you're gonna tell me things?

31:14.233 --> 31:17.067
But I don't tell you things.

31:17.100 --> 31:19.667
I mean, about them.
I'm not hiding anything.

31:19.700 --> 31:25.567
No, I believe you.
I believe you.

31:25.600 --> 31:30.933
Hey, I gotta
tell you something.

31:30.967 --> 31:34.867
You are smart and
beautiful and talented,

31:34.900 --> 31:38.200
and you deserve
better friends.

31:45.433 --> 31:50.067
Okay, I'll look into it
tomorrow. Thanks Devin.

31:50.067 --> 31:52.133
Good night.

31:58.800 --> 32:01.800
I probably could've
handled this better.

32:01.833 --> 32:04.967
Not the investigation,
you kinda gotta go

32:05.067 --> 32:09.067
where the evidence
goes. But the kids.

32:14.267 --> 32:16.333
You were right.

32:16.367 --> 32:19.200
About?

32:19.233 --> 32:24.367
Respecting their space.
I just came on too hard.

32:24.400 --> 32:27.400
You've got a job to do.

32:27.433 --> 32:31.900
You're juggling a lot of
people's needs right now.

32:33.267 --> 32:35.100
I got a need right now.

32:35.133 --> 32:37.700
Oh you do, do you?

32:37.733 --> 32:40.667
I wanna hear it
one more time...

32:40.700 --> 32:42.067
Hear what?

32:42.067 --> 32:45.067
Please?

32:45.100 --> 32:46.767
Okay.

32:46.800 --> 32:51.267
You... were... right.

32:53.200 --> 32:55.833
But just to be clear,
only on this one topic.

32:55.867 --> 32:59.400
This one time.

32:59.433 --> 33:03.333
I better go mark
it on the calendar.

33:09.700 --> 33:11.633
Rachel told me about
Suzie slipping away during

33:11.667 --> 33:14.700
study group, and dragging
Tracey along with her as cover.

33:14.733 --> 33:16.867
I'm not saying that Trevor
and Suzie weren't a couple,

33:16.900 --> 33:18.767
I just think it's
also the drugs.

33:18.800 --> 33:20.367
All three of them?

33:20.400 --> 33:21.900
Yeah, maybe the
whole group.

33:21.933 --> 33:23.167
Except Rachel?

33:23.200 --> 33:25.467
Except Rachel. She
noticed a difference in them

33:25.500 --> 33:27.233
and they had
stopped inviting her.

33:27.267 --> 33:30.967
Suzie as supplier makes
sense. We've cleared Jake.

33:31.067 --> 33:33.567
And there's no indication
Trevor had a stash anywhere.

33:33.600 --> 33:37.233
Suzie ties Trevor
to the study group.

33:37.267 --> 33:40.900
I think we need to
bring Suzie back in.

33:40.933 --> 33:45.133
This is bad enough as
a cop, but as a dad...

33:45.167 --> 33:48.167
You gotta imagine the pressure
these kids are under at home,

33:48.200 --> 33:50.767
to be willing to go to these
lengths, so they can say

33:50.800 --> 33:54.833
they're the best. I'll call
Suzie's dad, see if --

33:54.867 --> 34:02.600
Wait. It's not Suzie. Because
it's about being the best.

34:02.633 --> 34:04.967
Right.

34:20.067 --> 34:22.133
I was beginning to think
she wasn't going to show.

34:22.167 --> 34:23.667
She's got business
to take care of.

34:23.700 --> 34:24.900
Look at that
determined walk.

34:24.933 --> 34:27.533
Must be meeting
someone important.

34:30.667 --> 34:33.767
Hurry up, I have
to get back to--

34:45.833 --> 34:48.633
Mr. Witherspoon?

34:55.200 --> 34:58.767
Tracey is lying. I don't know
anything about the pills,

34:58.800 --> 35:01.233
how can I tell you how
the students got them?

35:01.267 --> 35:04.267
So Tracey was just meeting you
in your car, at lunch time,

35:04.300 --> 35:09.300
to discuss what?
Extra-curricular activities?

35:09.333 --> 35:12.233
That's a disgusting implication.
I would never be involved

35:12.267 --> 35:14.900
with one of my
students like that.

35:14.933 --> 35:18.167
Mr. Witherspoon.
I believe you.

35:18.200 --> 35:19.833
Thank you.

35:19.867 --> 35:22.800
You care about your students,
isn't that what you said?

35:22.833 --> 35:24.567
I care about them,
but not like that!

35:24.600 --> 35:28.233
Of course not. You just want
them to succeed, don't you?

35:28.267 --> 35:30.267
Yes, I want them to succeed.

35:30.300 --> 35:32.200
I want them to
fulfill their potential.

35:32.233 --> 35:35.867
Because if they succeed,
you succeed, don't you?

35:35.900 --> 35:37.167
I suppose.

35:37.200 --> 35:40.300
Don't be shy, Mr. Witherspoon.
We've been told that your

35:40.333 --> 35:42.933
test scores are some of the
highest in the district.

35:42.967 --> 35:44.500
Are they?

35:44.533 --> 35:48.233
Yes, they are. And
Crestview High School

35:48.267 --> 35:50.600
benefits from that,
don't they?

35:50.633 --> 35:52.567
I suppose they do.

35:52.600 --> 35:54.067
I hope you get a bonus.

35:54.067 --> 35:55.633
I get a small one, yes.

35:55.667 --> 35:58.333
Small?
That's not right.

35:58.367 --> 36:01.067
It's not about the money,
it's about the prestige, okay?

36:01.100 --> 36:03.500
It's about the kids, they
deserve to be recognized.

36:03.533 --> 36:08.533
What about you? Don't you
deserve recognition, too?

36:08.567 --> 36:11.800
Their success is
my recognition.

36:11.833 --> 36:14.200
So everything is tied
up in their success.

36:14.233 --> 36:15.933
You're willing to do
anything to help your

36:15.967 --> 36:17.367
students succeed,
aren't you?

36:17.400 --> 36:21.367
Is that how it started? You
wanted to give your motivated

36:21.400 --> 36:25.100
kids that extra edge, so that
everybody would acknowledge

36:25.133 --> 36:28.733
what a great
teacher you are?

36:36.267 --> 36:37.800
They were only meant
to go to Tracey.

36:37.833 --> 36:40.833
I wanted to help her.

36:41.733 --> 36:44.733
But she came back
and wanted more?

36:44.767 --> 36:47.867
For her friends.

36:47.900 --> 36:50.167
She said the whole
group should be the best.

36:50.200 --> 36:52.233
And if I didn't give her
more, she was gonna tell

36:52.267 --> 36:54.133
that I gave them to her
in the first place.

36:54.167 --> 36:55.733
She blackmailed you?

36:55.767 --> 36:56.933
Yes!

36:56.967 --> 36:58.700
You had no choice.

36:58.733 --> 37:00.233
Exactly.

37:00.267 --> 37:05.333
But you did, Mr. Witherspoon.
You had a choice.

37:05.367 --> 37:07.800
You didn't have to give
those kids those pills.

37:07.833 --> 37:16.067
You're a teacher. Your students,
and their parents trusted you.

37:16.100 --> 37:23.233
I know.
I'm so sorry.

37:23.267 --> 37:25.333
I don't know if that's
enough of an apology

37:25.367 --> 37:27.333
for Trevor's parents.

37:27.367 --> 37:29.333
I just wanted
the best for those kids.

37:29.367 --> 37:32.067
I never meant
to hurt Trevor.

37:32.067 --> 37:34.400
Randall Witherspoon,
you're under arrest

37:34.433 --> 37:36.967
for negligent homicide.

37:37.067 --> 37:39.667
Anything you say can
and will be used

37:39.700 --> 37:42.233
against you in a
court of law.

37:42.267 --> 37:44.233
You have the right
to an attorney.

37:44.267 --> 37:49.100
If you cannot afford one,
one will be appointed to you.

38:16.867 --> 38:19.467
Can I sit here?

38:27.300 --> 38:29.067
Sure, go ahead.

38:29.100 --> 38:31.733
Thank you.

38:48.067 --> 38:50.900
Sit here.

38:50.933 --> 38:53.400
No, I'm cool.

39:38.767 --> 39:42.200
It bothers me that Witherspoon's
source is still out there.

39:43.500 --> 39:46.067
We'll keep looking.

39:46.100 --> 39:49.300
As the trial gets closer,
he might get more helpful.

39:49.333 --> 39:51.733
It's satisfying
putting Witherspoon away.

39:51.767 --> 39:57.067
But to see a kid like Tracey
headed down the juvie path?

39:57.067 --> 39:59.300
Witherspoon initiated it,
but she's still guilty of

39:59.333 --> 40:02.967
distribution and
planting those pills on Jake.

40:03.000 --> 40:06.533
We'll see what her judge says.
Tracey's a smart kid.

40:06.567 --> 40:11.533
Hopefully she can turn it around
and not make that mistake again.

40:11.567 --> 40:15.567
I think it's time to
wrap up, head home,

40:15.600 --> 40:20.633
and hug our smart, healthy,
balanced children.

40:20.667 --> 40:24.800
Don't jinx it.

40:24.833 --> 40:27.767
Good night.

40:48.033 --> 40:49.000
Hey!

40:49.033 --> 40:50.000
Hey...

40:50.033 --> 40:51.467
Everything okay?

40:51.500 --> 40:54.967
Yeah, I'm fine.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.133
Physics?

40:56.167 --> 40:57.533
Yeah.

40:57.567 --> 41:01.433
Wish I could help you, but I
was never any good in physics.

41:01.467 --> 41:04.600
It's fine, I only
have a couple of pages.

41:04.633 --> 41:05.900
Why don't you put
your books away?

41:05.933 --> 41:10.433
Sleeping is just as
important as studying.

41:10.467 --> 41:12.233
Love you, honey.

41:12.267 --> 41:15.267
Love you too.

41:15.300 --> 41:17.833
Put 'em away!

41:21.200 --> 41:22.867
So how's she doing?

41:22.900 --> 41:25.133
Better.

41:25.167 --> 41:26.333
And you're doing...?

41:26.367 --> 41:29.067
Better.

41:29.067 --> 41:31.267
I meet a girl like Tracey,
who seems to have had every

41:31.300 --> 41:34.233
advantage, even more than our
kids, and it baffles me how

41:34.267 --> 41:38.500
wrong she is about life,
school, everything.

41:38.533 --> 41:41.067
You're forgetting about one
major advantage that our kids,

41:41.100 --> 41:44.267
and our niece and nephew
have that Tracey doesn't.

41:44.300 --> 41:46.100
What?

41:46.133 --> 41:48.133
You.

41:48.167 --> 41:50.233
No, it's you.

41:50.267 --> 41:52.733
You're right, it's me.

41:52.767 --> 41:55.233
It might be us.
It might be, but--

41:55.267 --> 41:57.300
A little bit...

41:57.333 --> 41:59.600
Do you think the kids
will ever forgive me

41:59.633 --> 42:01.067
for tresspassing
on their turf?

42:01.067 --> 42:02.800
You got justice for Trevor.

42:02.833 --> 42:05.633
They're going to see,
that's what matters.

42:05.667 --> 42:08.067
I hope so.

42:09.967 --> 42:11.767
I hope so, too.

42:11.800 --> 42:15.400
Because then you'll have to
say those three words again.

42:15.433 --> 42:19.667
You... were... right!

42:19.700 --> 42:23.933
Wait and see.
