15:56.241 --> 16:00.413
[phone buzzes]

16:02.862 --> 16:06.931
- Yes, weapon was loaded.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.965
- And the weapon
was pointed at Kayce

16:09.034 --> 16:10.310
or the other agent?

16:14.620 --> 16:17.758
- No, Kayce first,
then the officer.

16:17.827 --> 16:20.758
Isn't that right?
- Hmm?

16:20.827 --> 16:22.482
- Care to join the meeting?

16:22.551 --> 16:25.275
- Yeah. Sorry I'm--yes.

16:28.172 --> 16:30.413
Sorry, the so boy was--

16:30.482 --> 16:32.620
he pointed the shotgun
at Kayce,

16:32.689 --> 16:33.724
then the livestock agent.

16:33.793 --> 16:35.103
What does it say in the report?

16:35.172 --> 16:37.000
- Sheriff doesn't specify
in the report.

16:41.275 --> 16:43.000
- Dirty son of a bitch.

16:48.206 --> 16:51.068
[phone buzzing]

16:51.137 --> 16:52.620
Just answer it, son.

16:52.689 --> 16:54.827
- Sorry, yes. Apologies.
- Jesus.

17:02.896 --> 17:05.205
- Yeah.
Sarah: Finally.

17:05.275 --> 17:06.964
Jamie, avoiding me

17:07.034 --> 17:08.517
won't prevent the article
from coming out.

17:08.586 --> 17:10.310
- [chuckles]

17:10.378 --> 17:13.344
You know, I'm not
avoiding you--I'm just...

17:13.413 --> 17:15.137
Things are different now.

17:15.205 --> 17:17.344
- Nothing's different, Jamie.

17:17.413 --> 17:18.827
I need to verify some
of your statement

17:18.896 --> 17:21.482
before I talk to your father.

17:21.550 --> 17:23.655
- My father.

17:23.723 --> 17:26.068
- Yeah, I have to give him
an opportunity to respond.

17:28.862 --> 17:31.965
- Sarah, I'm begging you.

17:32.034 --> 17:33.517
I pulled out of the race.

17:33.586 --> 17:36.655
I'm rescinding my
permission to be quoted.

17:36.724 --> 17:38.137
- Yeah, doesn't
work like that.

17:38.206 --> 17:39.448
- It does now.

17:39.517 --> 17:40.965
- I need you to
confirm a few things.

17:41.034 --> 17:43.482
- I'm not confirming anything.

17:43.551 --> 17:46.724
If you quote me once
or refer to me in any way,

17:46.793 --> 17:50.482
I will fucking sue
you into oblivion.

17:50.551 --> 17:53.586
- Fine, Jamie.
I'll have Legal call

17:53.655 --> 17:55.827
and walk you through
your lack of options.

18:05.517 --> 18:07.172
- It looks to me
like the sheriff's report

18:07.241 --> 18:08.896
is intentionally vague,

18:08.965 --> 18:11.068
to give a sense your agents
didn't follow procedure.

18:11.137 --> 18:14.448
The real issue is their
failure to respond.

18:14.517 --> 18:16.551
Once it's official
and I'm sworn in,

18:16.620 --> 18:18.379
this will be the first
thing I dig into.

18:18.448 --> 18:21.413
- The general election is all
Haskell's thinking about.

18:21.482 --> 18:24.379
- This will go away
long before then.

18:25.413 --> 18:26.482
- Thank you, Cassidy.

18:26.551 --> 18:28.551
- Anything else?

18:39.551 --> 18:40.862
- What?

18:40.931 --> 18:43.275
- I'm having a moment of sorts.

18:43.344 --> 18:45.068
- Should I be worried
about what happens next?

18:45.137 --> 18:49.586
- No, this one's ...

18:49.655 --> 18:52.000
It's more philosophical
in nature.

18:55.137 --> 18:57.000
- You ever wonder
what this place looked like

18:57.068 --> 19:00.379
before any of us were here?

19:00.448 --> 19:04.413
- All the time, honey.

19:04.482 --> 19:07.034
All the time.

19:18.379 --> 19:20.103
- When you fire a pistol,
you aren't aiming.

19:20.172 --> 19:21.482
You point.
- Okay.

19:21.551 --> 19:23.551
- It's sense memory.
Repetition.

19:25.724 --> 19:29.068
Hold your hands up,
like a boxer.

19:29.137 --> 19:31.310
Get your feet
in a fighting stance.

19:31.379 --> 19:34.586
- Like this?

19:34.655 --> 19:35.827
- I need you to trust me.

19:35.896 --> 19:37.655
- Okay.

19:37.724 --> 19:40.241
- Put your feet together.

19:40.310 --> 19:41.827
Now let yourself
fall toward me.

19:41.896 --> 19:43.862
- What?
- Fall towards me.

19:43.931 --> 19:46.689
- You're gonna catch me?
- I won't have to, but yes.

19:50.482 --> 19:52.448
Make fists.

19:52.517 --> 19:55.000
Now throw a punch in the air,
but don't bring it back.

19:57.482 --> 19:59.862
Open your hand.

20:01.965 --> 20:06.586
Extend your other hand.

20:06.655 --> 20:08.931
Keep both eyes open.
- Yep.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.137
- Focus on the front sight.

20:11.206 --> 20:13.379
Cover your target with it.

20:13.448 --> 20:15.000
Now fire.

20:17.310 --> 20:19.000
Again.

20:24.034 --> 20:26.172
- I feel like a god.

20:26.241 --> 20:27.620
- Whoever holds the gun is god.

20:27.689 --> 20:29.931
Until they pull the trigger.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.379
Then you're the devil.

20:54.034 --> 20:56.379
- Can I help you?

20:56.448 --> 20:59.482
- Mr. Jenkins.
Hello.

21:02.241 --> 21:04.620
- Gun, gun!
Put it down! Listen to me!

21:04.689 --> 21:06.551
I will shoot you
in the fucking face

21:06.620 --> 21:09.172
if you don't drop
the weapon!

21:09.241 --> 21:12.068
- I'm a god.

21:15.655 --> 21:18.103
Pull the trigger
and you're the devil.

21:18.172 --> 21:20.000
- I'm already the devil.

21:22.448 --> 21:24.103
- Jesus.
What the fuck are we doing?

21:24.172 --> 21:27.758
- We're not doing anything.
Stay here.

21:34.793 --> 21:36.931
- I saw lots of pictures
of family...

21:38.448 --> 21:41.000
but no family.

21:41.068 --> 21:43.034
- I sent them away.

21:43.103 --> 21:45.413
- Why'd you do that?

21:47.724 --> 21:49.931
- So you wouldn't kill them.

21:51.068 --> 21:53.000
- How you doing?

21:53.068 --> 21:54.206
- Can I help you?

21:54.275 --> 21:55.413
- You Mr. Jenkins?

21:55.482 --> 21:57.034
I'm with Big Sky Roofing.

21:57.103 --> 21:58.586
Got a leak, huh?

21:58.655 --> 21:59.965
- Yeah, just, umm...
give me a minute.

22:01.862 --> 22:04.896
- Hey!

22:04.965 --> 22:06.275
Toss the pistol over.

22:07.965 --> 22:11.034
Do it.

22:13.448 --> 22:16.862
Now the radio.

22:16.931 --> 22:20.000
Got cuffs?
You know the drill.

22:20.068 --> 22:22.689
- I'm a fucking law
enforcement agent.

22:24.655 --> 22:25.896
- You're not the only one.

22:27.344 --> 22:30.758
- Doing a little moonlighting,
are we?

22:30.827 --> 22:33.482
- Alimony's a bitch.
Get up.

22:35.379 --> 22:39.241
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Get in.

22:39.310 --> 22:40.482
- Asshole!

22:40.551 --> 22:43.344
- Fuck you.

22:43.413 --> 22:45.689
- Nobody wants
to fucking kill you.

22:45.758 --> 22:48.103
We just want to live our lives
the way we've been living them

22:48.172 --> 22:49.931
for the past hundred years.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.517
And you keep coming here and
trying to take it away from us

22:51.586 --> 22:54.793
All we just want you
to fucking stop.

22:54.862 --> 22:56.896
Thought I made that clear.

22:56.965 --> 22:58.344
Guess I'm wrong.

22:58.413 --> 22:59.620
- You made it clear.

22:59.689 --> 23:03.137
You hung me
from a fucking rope.

23:03.206 --> 23:05.896
Now you sit on my porch

23:05.965 --> 23:09.241
and you fucking threaten me?
Again?!

23:10.689 --> 23:15.034
What the fuck do you want?!

23:15.103 --> 23:18.137
What do you want?

23:18.206 --> 23:21.034
What warrants you being
in my fucking house!

23:23.103 --> 23:24.862
- You killed our cattle.

23:26.068 --> 23:29.827
- I did what?

23:29.896 --> 23:32.034
I don't know
how to kill cattle.

23:32.103 --> 23:36.551
You stupid fucking redneck.

23:36.620 --> 23:38.655
I'll tell you what
I do know how to do.

23:38.724 --> 23:41.068
I know how to crush empires.

23:41.137 --> 23:43.517
And I will crush your father's.

23:47.586 --> 23:50.068
Thank you for showing me
the rules that you play by.

23:51.689 --> 23:53.758
I look forward to the challenge.

24:08.103 --> 24:10.758
[gun cocks]

24:14.620 --> 24:17.482
- What a fucked situation
this is.

24:17.551 --> 24:19.586
Forgot to ask me for my keys.

24:19.655 --> 24:22.310
I guess I'll be
the only grown-up in the room.

24:25.206 --> 24:27.620
- Kayce!

24:27.689 --> 24:28.896
- You're going
to tell me the truth

24:28.965 --> 24:30.965
right fucking now,
you prick.

24:31.034 --> 24:32.448
Now!

24:32.517 --> 24:34.896
- I don't know
how to kill cows.

24:34.965 --> 24:36.896
I wish I did.

24:36.965 --> 24:41.586
When I see the pain it's caused
you and your family.

24:41.655 --> 24:44.482
I wish it had been me.

25:01.758 --> 25:05.724
- My guess is you're from
a California office.

25:05.793 --> 25:07.758
I'd go back to it
if I were you.

25:07.827 --> 25:09.896
- Make me.

25:09.965 --> 25:11.620
- Rules are different
around here.

25:11.689 --> 25:12.655
- I know these rules.

25:12.724 --> 25:15.310
- Yeah. We'll see.

25:33.034 --> 25:35.758
- Wasn't Jenkins.

25:35.827 --> 25:37.551
- It had to be.

25:37.620 --> 25:38.896
- I looked him in the eye.
It wasn't him.

25:45.344 --> 25:47.827
- What happened?
- It's fine.

25:47.896 --> 25:50.206
- No, I mean,
you don't look fine.

25:50.275 --> 25:51.689
- Didn't say I was fine.

25:51.758 --> 25:53.310
I was just saying it went fine.

25:56.586 --> 26:00.206
- You know, sometimes
I look at you, and I...

26:00.275 --> 26:02.724
I don't recognize the man
looking back at me.

26:06.689 --> 26:08.793
What happened to you
over there, son?

26:11.275 --> 26:13.931
- I don't like
to talk about it.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.965
I notice you don't, either.

26:18.793 --> 26:20.586
- I never talked about it
'cuz I never saw the point,

26:24.103 --> 26:26.137
We might be more alike
than you wanna admit.

26:48.620 --> 26:50.862
- You wanna hear a war story?

26:50.931 --> 26:53.379
- Yeah.

26:53.448 --> 26:55.862
If it helps explain
the man looking at me,

26:55.931 --> 26:58.793
then yes, I do son.

27:04.206 --> 27:06.586
- We were in Pakistan.

27:06.655 --> 27:09.172
Weren't supposed to be there,
but that's where we were.

27:12.482 --> 27:15.758
We're hitting
a high value target.

27:15.827 --> 27:18.103
We blew the door
off his house,

27:18.172 --> 27:21.517
making our way down the hall,

27:21.586 --> 27:24.931
when this piece of shit
moves out of his bedroom,

27:25.000 --> 27:28.413
using his wife as a shield...

27:28.482 --> 27:32.275
and he's got 8-year-old
daughter on a leash,

27:32.344 --> 27:34.655
front of him.
And he's holding an AK-47

27:34.724 --> 27:37.689
over their heads,

27:37.758 --> 27:42.551
and starts
sending rounds at us.

27:42.620 --> 27:44.758
And everybody froze

27:44.827 --> 27:48.655
because his family...

27:48.724 --> 27:50.896
until it got my weapons sergeant
and my medic killed.

27:54.965 --> 27:57.862
So, I had a decision to make...

28:00.379 --> 28:02.344
and in a tenth-of-a-second
I made it.

28:06.482 --> 28:09.206
I killed him and his wife
and that little girl.

28:23.965 --> 28:26.724
Soldiers don't tell war
stories anymore, Dad.

28:26.793 --> 28:30.482
'Cause wars these days...

28:30.551 --> 28:33.000
it's just about trying
to live through 'em.

28:50.517 --> 28:52.206
- First down, three wide
receivers...

28:52.275 --> 28:54.448
Left side, Roberts, back...

28:54.517 --> 28:56.586
Plenty of time
to get downfield...

28:56.655 --> 28:59.862
and wide open...

28:59.931 --> 29:01.517
- Ahh...

29:01.586 --> 29:04.310
[knock on door]

30:12.000 --> 30:14.344
- County Sheriff's
Department failed...

30:14.413 --> 30:17.827
to provide back up to the
livestock agents involved,

30:17.896 --> 30:20.586
increasing the likelihood
of a violent response

30:20.655 --> 30:22.827
from the suspect.

30:22.896 --> 30:24.551
Though our investigation
is preliminary,

30:24.620 --> 30:26.517
the shooting was justifiable

30:26.586 --> 30:27.758
and the only action

30:27.827 --> 30:29.620
available
to the livestock agent,

30:29.689 --> 30:31.482
whose life was clearly
in danger.

30:31.551 --> 30:33.310
Now currently
we are conducting

30:33.379 --> 30:35.517
an exhaustive internal
investigation

30:35.586 --> 30:38.068
into the procedures
of our dispatchers

30:38.137 --> 30:39.827
and the reaction time
of our deputies

30:39.896 --> 30:43.620
and I want to express
our sincerest apologies

30:43.689 --> 30:46.862
to the Montana Livestock
Agent involved

30:46.931 --> 30:49.517
as well as the agency
as a whole

30:49.586 --> 30:52.862
for our failure to respond,

30:52.931 --> 30:57.379
aggravating the dangers
that those agents faced.

30:57.448 --> 30:59.517
[reporters shouting questions]

31:02.068 --> 31:05.931
- Jesus, how'd you
get him to say that?

31:08.241 --> 31:11.413
- I didn't.

31:18.310 --> 31:21.896
- I think you just run
down and say 'whoa.'

31:21.965 --> 31:24.241
- I'm afraid there might be
a little more to it than that,

31:24.310 --> 31:26.103
- Wait, you know how to do it?

31:26.172 --> 31:28.586
- Well I ain't gonna win
no money doing at it, but...

31:28.655 --> 31:31.862
I don't think you are either.

31:31.931 --> 31:35.206
- I'm a little thin
on options.

31:35.275 --> 31:37.172
- Look, just run down the arena,

31:37.241 --> 31:39.689
point your belt buckle
to the sky.

31:39.758 --> 31:42.896
Keep your eyes
on the top of the barn.

31:42.965 --> 31:46.620
Then open your feet
and say 'whoa.'

31:46.689 --> 31:48.620
- How fast do
I need need to go?

31:48.689 --> 31:50.448
- Faster you go,
the farther you gonna stop.

31:50.517 --> 31:52.551
- Okay.
- You got it.

31:52.620 --> 31:55.206
- It's easy.
- Easy.

31:55.275 --> 31:57.241
- Easy...
- Mm-hm.

32:10.448 --> 32:11.965
Whoa.

32:12.034 --> 32:14.931
Oh, fuck!
