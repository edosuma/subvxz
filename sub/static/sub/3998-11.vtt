WEBVTT

00:00.234 --> 00:02.568
Well, nothing brightens up
a rainy day

00:02.803 --> 00:04.170
like a Scotch tasting, guys.

00:04.204 --> 00:06.272
It's not raining today.
It hasn't rained in months.

00:06.306 --> 00:07.378
Shh, don't ruin the moment.

00:07.379 --> 00:09.818
There's actually a huge forest fire.
Dude, you should turn on the news.

00:09.948 --> 00:13.622
This is a 15-year-old
French oak reserve.

00:13.757 --> 00:17.283
Mm! A note of cedar,
vanilla, tobacky.

00:17.317 --> 00:18.551
Boozy.

00:18.585 --> 00:20.853
Hunting, fishing, shooting,

00:20.888 --> 00:24.654
fatherhood, bonding, sadness.

00:25.125 --> 00:26.359
Please don't leave me.

00:26.393 --> 00:28.127
- Cheers, guys. Put 'er there Schmidty.
- Cheers.

00:28.162 --> 00:29.695
Cheers.

00:29.730 --> 00:32.031
- To a nice quiet evening.
- Tranquil.

00:32.064 --> 00:34.700
This moment is so chill
and absent of drama,

00:34.735 --> 00:36.469
I want to call it "Tim Duncan."

00:36.503 --> 00:38.538
I have 21 minutes to make
a life-changing decision

00:38.572 --> 00:40.573
and you beautiful sons-a-bitches
are gonna help me!

00:40.607 --> 00:42.942
- Whoa.
- Yeah!

00:42.976 --> 00:45.077
That is $45 worth of Scotch
right there.

00:45.112 --> 00:48.247
It tastes disgusting.
I don't like it.

00:57.157 --> 00:59.725
So, obviously, Nick has told you
about how I've been volunteering

00:59.760 --> 01:02.395
at the Children's Museum,
and really hitting it off

01:02.429 --> 01:03.796
with the head curator,
Candace, right?

01:03.830 --> 01:05.164
In my way, I have.

01:05.199 --> 01:06.632
- I've never heard that.
- Hasn't said a word. Thank God.

01:06.667 --> 01:07.967
Come on.

01:08.001 --> 01:09.635
Guys, give me one second.

01:09.670 --> 01:11.604
I gotta go play a round
of "Car Keys Monte"

01:11.638 --> 01:13.773
with Kevin-97 or he'll try
to drive home.

01:15.414 --> 01:17.510
So, anyway, about a month ago,
Candace calls me and tells me

01:17.544 --> 01:20.605
there might be a full-time
fund-raising position opening up

01:20.640 --> 01:21.948
- and I'd be perfect for it.
- There we go,

01:21.982 --> 01:23.950
look for the keys, look for the keys,
look for the keys.

01:23.984 --> 01:25.651
And she keeps pushing
me for an answer,

01:25.686 --> 01:26.819
and I keep putting her off.

01:26.853 --> 01:28.321
I say, "Thank you very much.
I'm very flattered,

01:28.355 --> 01:30.256
but I already have a job.
Me teacher."

01:31.417 --> 01:32.925
That's a grammar joke.
You get it.

01:32.960 --> 01:35.294
Look at the jukebox for a sec.

01:35.329 --> 01:37.530
When I think of teachers,
I think of two things: Jessica Day

01:37.564 --> 01:39.432
and pornography where
the characters are teachers.

01:39.466 --> 01:41.500
Well, of course I've always
wanted to be a teacher,

01:41.535 --> 01:43.135
but my school's a disaster.

01:43.170 --> 01:45.104
Justice Brandeis believed
that...

01:45.138 --> 01:45.939
Ms. Day?

01:45.973 --> 01:48.541
Education's Principal Foster,
everybody!

01:49.076 --> 01:51.477
Thank you so much.

01:51.511 --> 01:55.432
Ms. Day, we have hit
a construction hiccup

01:55.462 --> 01:57.318
- in our renovation, so...
- Okay.

01:57.447 --> 02:00.255
Everybody's gonna have
to be sharing classroom space.

02:00.256 --> 02:01.078
What?

02:02.036 --> 02:03.766
- Oh.
- Hey, do you have a freezer

02:03.925 --> 02:07.493
or should I flush these frogs?
My check comes either way.

02:07.527 --> 02:11.297
Oh, come on. Foster's sticking
us with the math kids

02:11.331 --> 02:13.799
that use letters
instead of numbers?

02:13.834 --> 02:15.167
Do you mean algebra?

02:15.202 --> 02:16.929
I guess.

02:16.955 --> 02:19.839
Anyway, it's gonna be a
couple of crazy months, huh?

02:19.873 --> 02:21.407
I'm sorry? Months?

02:21.441 --> 02:23.909
Right. Years
if the bond issue fails.

02:23.944 --> 02:27.246
Which it might, since voters
are trending anti-future.

02:27.281 --> 02:29.715
Anti-future?
Who's anti-future?

02:29.750 --> 02:33.319
I don't know. The Amish?
The dying?

02:33.353 --> 02:35.821
Television industry,
print media,

02:35.856 --> 02:38.691
record industry,
railroad industry,

02:38.725 --> 02:42.061
karaoke machine owners.
You got this?

02:42.095 --> 02:45.231
I'm gonna go not smoke pot.

02:45.265 --> 02:48.334
- So my phone rings...
- Oh, we telling phone stories? Nice.

02:48.368 --> 02:50.436
- No, I'm talking about work.
- So your phone rings.

02:50.470 --> 02:52.758
And it's Candace
officially offering me the job!

02:52.894 --> 02:54.206
And I told her I'd think about it!

02:54.241 --> 02:57.176
Wow, you not being
a school teacher?

02:57.210 --> 02:58.912
Well, you have found
my flabbergast button,

02:58.946 --> 03:01.080
and guess what,
you've pressed it.

03:01.114 --> 03:02.882
I'm flabbergasted as hell, too.

03:02.917 --> 03:04.551
Look, I've been a teacher
my entire life,

03:04.585 --> 03:06.119
and I've always wanted
to be a teacher,

03:06.153 --> 03:09.194
but maybe I should be doing
something else. I don't know.

03:09.222 --> 03:11.223
How do you know when
you're on the right path?

03:11.892 --> 03:14.026
It's crazy.

03:14.061 --> 03:15.695
That wasn't
a rhetorical question.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.063
- Oh!
- Oh!

03:17.097 --> 03:19.531
What I like to do is just
take a drive up PCH maybe.

03:19.566 --> 03:21.801
Willy Wonka once said...

03:21.835 --> 03:24.603
Guys, Candace is calling at 6:00
to find out my final answer!

03:24.638 --> 03:25.805
- Whoa!
- What?

03:25.839 --> 03:27.340
I'm sorry you're in
such a pickle.

03:27.374 --> 03:30.276
But I'm not sorry
that I get to time something!

03:30.310 --> 03:31.744
19 minutes, people!

03:31.778 --> 03:35.247
- All right.
- Just to be clear, 19 minutes until 6:00.

03:35.282 --> 03:36.882
I'm not sure this is helping.

03:36.917 --> 03:39.061
This brings a whole new level
of tension to the whole situation.

03:39.062 --> 03:39.785
Yeah, because
you're being timed now.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.020
- You time a lot of stuff, Coach.
- 46 seconds.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.774
This is a life-changing
decision, that's it.

03:43.475 --> 03:46.510
17 minutes till 6:00.
17 minutes, Jess.

03:46.544 --> 03:48.845
Coach, do you always
wear a stopwatch? Like always?

03:48.880 --> 03:52.182
You familiar with Rollergirl's relationship
to her skates in <i>Boogie Nights</i> ?

03:52.217 --> 03:53.675
- Yes.
- Well, I'm not,

03:53.824 --> 03:56.653
because I don't watch movies,
I time them.

03:56.688 --> 03:59.690
They're pornographers,
but they're also a family.

03:59.724 --> 04:03.126
155:30 official running time,
my round ass!

04:03.161 --> 04:07.218
Jess, choosing a career path
is never easy,

04:07.366 --> 04:08.565
but what I found...

04:08.600 --> 04:10.567
- Oh, my God.
- Shut up, dude!

04:10.602 --> 04:11.569
She's looking
for career advice.

04:11.603 --> 04:13.838
Your job could be done
by a vending machine.

04:13.872 --> 04:15.372
Guys, don't be mean.

04:15.407 --> 04:17.673
So Nick doesn't have
a traditional career. I mean...

04:17.709 --> 04:20.644
Or is it the most traditional?

04:20.678 --> 04:22.512
Maybe I'm thinking
about prostitution.

04:22.547 --> 04:25.515
Guys, as you all know, I am
the expert at changing career paths.

04:25.550 --> 04:27.017
Is this something
we're now bragging about?

04:27.051 --> 04:28.518
No, Schmidt,
I'm referring to my decision

04:28.553 --> 04:30.020
to quit playing
the game of basketball.

04:30.054 --> 04:33.023
Jess, I will tell you this,
it was not easy.

04:34.124 --> 04:35.587
<i>It all began back...</i>

04:35.622 --> 04:36.829
<i>Come on, Winston
move it along.</i>

04:36.960 --> 04:37.594
<i>Okay, Jess, fine,</i>

04:37.629 --> 04:41.198
but don't blame me if you get
lost in the nooks and crannies

04:41.232 --> 04:46.003
of this crazy English muffin
we call Winston's life.

04:46.037 --> 04:47.671
<i>I was the ninth guy</i>
<i>off the bench</i>

04:47.705 --> 04:49.873
<i>for the eighth-best team</i>
<i>in Latvia.</i>

04:49.907 --> 04:52.442
Winnie the Bish!
Winnie the Bish!

04:52.477 --> 04:53.844
Winnie the Bish!

04:53.878 --> 04:56.013
Ha-ha! Thanks for coming
to watch me play, guys.

04:56.047 --> 04:57.848
We didn't watch you play.
We watched you sit.

04:57.882 --> 04:59.082
Which was still fun.

04:59.117 --> 05:01.118
You know, any chance
to get to Latvia, right, guys?

05:01.152 --> 05:02.886
Yeah, I haven't played all year.

05:02.920 --> 05:05.455
They barely let me practice,
but you know, like I always say,

05:05.490 --> 05:07.124
How about them Lats?

05:07.158 --> 05:08.759
<i>So that's when you decided</i>
<i>to change course.</i>

05:08.793 --> 05:11.228
That makes sense.
So my takeaway from that is...

05:11.262 --> 05:12.863
Still building to the decision.

05:12.897 --> 05:14.865
You are traded to Kraslava City.

05:14.899 --> 05:16.233
The Outdoor League?

05:16.267 --> 05:17.768
Man, they play on a hillside!

05:17.802 --> 05:21.271
I give you surprise tip:
Uphill basket, better.

05:21.306 --> 05:22.910
<i>Aha, and then you decided...</i>

05:22.940 --> 05:23.673
<i>Ah!</i>

05:24.773 --> 05:25.909
I'm going fast!

05:25.943 --> 05:27.044
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

05:28.413 --> 05:30.580
You never play
basketball again.

05:30.615 --> 05:33.717
Don't touch it.
Stop it.

05:33.751 --> 05:37.120
And <i>that's</i> when I decided to stop
playing the game of basketball.

05:37.155 --> 05:39.890
Jess, walk away the
moment you stop loving it.

05:39.924 --> 05:41.458
I mean, that's what I did.

05:41.492 --> 05:42.893
That's the thing,
you didn't walk away.

05:42.927 --> 05:45.762
You decided nothing. That story
contains zero decisions.

05:45.797 --> 05:49.333
Look, I decided to stop
playing the game of basketball

05:49.367 --> 05:52.002
when my doctor told me
I had to stop.

05:52.937 --> 05:55.939
Okay, okay, all right, I...
it was my decision...

05:55.973 --> 05:56.840
Mm-hmm.

05:56.874 --> 05:59.743
...to start to play
the game of basket...

05:59.778 --> 06:02.679
You were handed a basketball
six seconds after you were born.

06:02.714 --> 06:05.082
Damn, do I even like basketball?

06:05.116 --> 06:06.516
I mean, goodness,

06:06.551 --> 06:08.652
have I ever made any decisions
my whole life?

06:08.686 --> 06:11.321
Are we all just living inside
the mind of a giant?

06:11.356 --> 06:13.790
All right, good job, buddy.
Really good. Thanks.

06:13.825 --> 06:15.559
You know, if I may be so bold...

06:15.594 --> 06:17.160
Oh, Nick, please.
Winston, have a seat.

06:17.195 --> 06:19.162
I was literally about
to give advice.

06:19.197 --> 06:20.787
She already heard
one cautionary tale tonight,

06:20.897 --> 06:21.965
she does not need
to hear another.

06:21.999 --> 06:24.301
- What she needs to hear is my story.
- All right.

06:24.335 --> 06:27.872
A story of hard choices.
A story of paths taken.

06:27.906 --> 06:32.308
A story that I like to call,
"Kablamo McYeah, Bro!"

06:32.343 --> 06:34.010
Ah, you stupid bast...

06:34.045 --> 06:36.565
The title has nothing to do with
the story, but you need a hook.

06:37.670 --> 06:39.149
- <i>It all began back...</i>
- <i>Come on, Schmidt!</i>

06:39.183 --> 06:41.025
What? Only one story
in the whole wide world

06:41.065 --> 06:42.519
can begin in a hospital?

06:42.553 --> 06:43.854
I volunteered a lot in college.

06:43.888 --> 06:47.858
<i>But I shone brightest</i>
<i>as a candy striper.</i>

06:48.392 --> 06:49.726
<i>Sick people wanted me.</i>

06:49.760 --> 06:51.495
<i>Dying people</i>
<i>wanted to be me.</i>

06:51.529 --> 06:53.397
<i>I was the total</i>
<i>candy-striping package.</i>

06:53.431 --> 06:55.031
<i>And yet I remained invisible</i>

06:55.066 --> 06:57.000
<i>to the one whose gaze</i>
<i>I desired the most.</i>

06:57.034 --> 07:01.227
<i>Invisible? You were like</i>
<i>a 300-pound wall of peppermint bark.</i>

07:01.371 --> 07:03.112
<i>Her badge said "RN"</i>
<i>for registered nurse,</i>

07:03.241 --> 07:04.975
<i>but as far as I was concerned,</i>
<i>it said "NILTH,"</i>

07:05.009 --> 07:06.977
<i>"Nurse I'd Like To Hug."</i>

07:07.011 --> 07:09.513
<i>Not even the baggiest of scrubs</i>
<i>could hide her splendid form.</i>

07:12.950 --> 07:16.486
Where's a guy have to volunteer
to get a girl like that, huh?

07:16.521 --> 07:18.922
I don't volunteer.
I'm a man.

07:18.956 --> 07:21.591
I have a job in marketing.

07:22.832 --> 07:25.328
<i>Obviously I was far too fat</i>
<i>to work in marketing.</i>

07:25.363 --> 07:27.497
<i>So I got a job</i>
<i>any dumb slob could do.</i>

07:27.532 --> 07:30.200
Relax, man, it's your first day.

07:30.234 --> 07:32.869
<i>For a Jewish giant,</i>
<i>I had a surprising knack</i>

07:32.903 --> 07:34.104
<i>for selling Christmas trees.</i>

07:34.138 --> 07:36.173
<i>Not only did</i>
<i>my wide center of gravity</i>

07:36.207 --> 07:37.607
<i>make me freakishly strong,</i>

07:37.642 --> 07:39.743
<i>but I could also sell</i>
<i>like the wind.</i>

07:39.777 --> 07:41.578
<i>Because I understood</i>
<i>one fundamental truth.</i>

07:41.612 --> 07:44.114
When you're buying
Christmas trees...

07:44.148 --> 07:46.116
you're really buying sex.

07:46.150 --> 07:48.852
Have you always been short?
I've always been fat.

07:48.886 --> 07:51.254
But who cares how God made you?

07:51.289 --> 07:53.557
Don't let him put you
in a skin box.

07:53.591 --> 07:55.425
At the end of the day,
I'm just a fat guy

07:55.460 --> 07:57.427
standing here in front
of a short guy telling him

07:57.462 --> 08:00.630
that I think we found his tree.

08:00.665 --> 08:02.899
<i>It wasn't long before I caught</i>
<i>the attention of Old Man McCue,</i>

08:02.934 --> 08:05.635
<i>Christmas tree king</i>
<i>of Syracuse,</i>

08:05.670 --> 08:07.637
<i>inventor of triple netting.</i>

08:07.672 --> 08:10.140
<i>However...</i>

08:10.174 --> 08:13.577
In the words of the late,
great Sir Billy Joel...

08:13.611 --> 08:15.612
Billy Joel is definitely alive.

08:15.646 --> 08:17.447
And he's definitely
not a knight.

08:17.482 --> 08:18.815
"The good, they do die young."

When you're on your deathbed,

08:33.530 --> 08:36.466
when your life has been lived,

08:36.501 --> 08:38.501
you're never gonna say,

08:38.535 --> 08:41.404
"I wish I'd spent more time
with my family."

08:43.201 --> 08:47.277
Because money

09:07.882 --> 09:08.791
<i>Interesting, money.</i>

09:08.921 --> 09:11.468
Actually the museum job pays
more than the teaching job.

09:11.502 --> 09:13.169
Wait, the m...

09:13.204 --> 09:14.938
Then what the hell are we
talking about here, you guys?

09:14.972 --> 09:16.439
Done deal, case closed.

09:16.474 --> 09:18.308
Follow them ducats.

09:18.342 --> 09:19.476
It's not always
about the money, Schmidt.

09:19.510 --> 09:20.977
Guys, look, it's almost 6:00.

09:21.012 --> 09:22.979
And Candace is
insanely punctual.

09:23.014 --> 09:24.214
You know, one of the best

09:24.248 --> 09:26.683
career choices of the future...

09:26.717 --> 09:28.351
Driveways.

09:30.643 --> 09:32.188
You're welcome.

09:37.216 --> 09:39.624
- Jess, the museum job pays more.
- All right...

09:39.634 --> 09:41.667
- The decision has been made for you.
- No, no, no.

09:41.702 --> 09:43.705
You do know the difference
between more and less.

09:43.720 --> 09:44.871
- Don't you?
- Yes, Schmidt.

09:44.905 --> 09:46.772
All of my decision's have
been made for me.

09:46.807 --> 09:49.508
I'm only in sports radio because
I played professional basketball.

09:49.543 --> 09:50.910
I played professional basketball

09:50.944 --> 09:53.579
because somebody put a ball
in my crib as a baby.

09:53.613 --> 09:55.748
What if somebody gave
Baby Winston a flower?

09:55.782 --> 09:57.116
Then what would I be?

09:57.150 --> 09:58.884
- Beekeeper!
- Hummingbird farmer.

09:58.919 --> 10:00.186
Oh, does water shoot
out of the flower?

10:00.220 --> 10:01.220
If so, you'd be
a hilarious comedian.

10:01.254 --> 10:04.924
Wait, guys, this is
classic after 6:00 topics.

10:04.958 --> 10:06.859
Look, I... There has to be
more to this than money.

10:06.893 --> 10:08.461
I really want to care
about what I do.

10:08.495 --> 10:10.296
Don't you ever miss
getting your hands dirty

10:10.330 --> 10:12.731
- and selling?
- I've moved up in the world.

10:12.766 --> 10:14.366
I'm not freezing
and covered in sap.

10:14.401 --> 10:16.002
I'm making spreadsheets.

10:16.036 --> 10:17.803
It's like Old Man McCue
used to say.

10:17.838 --> 10:20.072
The reward is
in the destination.

10:20.107 --> 10:21.207
It's not in the journey.

10:21.241 --> 10:23.209
Was he wise or was he senile?

10:23.243 --> 10:26.212
Because he's mixed up a lot
of really well-known sayings.

10:26.246 --> 10:28.247
Jess, you're gonna
want to listen to me.

10:28.281 --> 10:30.649
Anyone else here named
after their career?

10:32.285 --> 10:34.153
People call you Markety?

10:34.187 --> 10:35.921
Not yet.

10:35.956 --> 10:37.756
That's too bad
'cause that's awesome.

10:37.791 --> 10:39.825
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

10:39.860 --> 10:41.494
Hands up, Ulvis!

10:41.528 --> 10:43.629
Ball screen, Vlad, come on!

10:43.663 --> 10:45.331
There we go, yes!

10:45.365 --> 10:47.833
Bishop, finger
out of your nose, now!

10:47.868 --> 10:49.768
Ernie's a really good coach.

10:49.803 --> 10:52.104
- Maybe we should call him Coach.
- We should probably call him...

10:52.139 --> 10:53.572
You do it first.

10:53.607 --> 10:55.241
- Yeah.
- Uh... Coach.

10:55.275 --> 10:56.942
That's a great name!
High five!

10:56.977 --> 10:57.977
Yeah!

10:58.011 --> 11:00.246
I think you see what I mean.

11:00.280 --> 11:01.280
No, I do...
I really don't.

11:01.314 --> 11:03.916
My point is
don't overthink it, Jess.

11:03.950 --> 11:06.018
The call's coming
from inside the house.

11:06.052 --> 11:07.253
What?

11:07.287 --> 11:09.788
Be who you are.
And do what you do.

11:09.823 --> 11:11.157
What if I don't know who I am?

11:11.191 --> 11:13.425
And you know, I'm capable of doing
a lot of different things.

11:13.460 --> 11:14.827
Then you are on your own.

11:14.861 --> 11:15.961
Good stuff, Coach.

11:15.996 --> 11:19.032
Jess, would it help to think
about your first day as a teacher?

11:19.066 --> 11:20.866
Like, I think about the first
time I ever poured a drink...

11:20.901 --> 11:22.334
- Boo, get off the stage!
- Aw, man.

11:22.369 --> 11:23.335
- Nick!
- Dude, stop.

11:23.370 --> 11:24.303
No, that's interesting.

11:24.337 --> 11:26.305
The first day I ever taught.

11:26.339 --> 11:28.508
<i>Portland Country Day.</i>

11:28.542 --> 11:31.143
<i>Five-team Pacific Northwest</i>
<i>squash champions.</i>

11:31.178 --> 11:33.580
<i>Go, Rhododendrons!</i>

11:34.314 --> 11:37.316
Now, if I was chalk,
where would I be?

11:37.350 --> 11:39.685
If I <i>were</i> chalk,
where would I be?

11:39.719 --> 11:41.720
Slip up like that
in front of the kids, Day,

11:41.755 --> 11:43.055
and they'll eat you alive.

11:46.726 --> 11:50.029
Eddie Pascucci kicked
my ass because I'm new.

11:50.063 --> 11:51.630
Well, guess what?

11:51.665 --> 11:53.132
I'm new, too.

11:53.166 --> 11:56.035
I got lost trying to find
the upper dining garden.

11:56.069 --> 11:59.405
Oh, that's over by the hedge maze
and the stables.

11:59.439 --> 12:02.308
I haven't even met my horse yet.

12:02.342 --> 12:03.909
Come on, let's get you
cleaned up.

12:03.944 --> 12:06.579
All of these jackets have
cash in the pockets.

12:06.613 --> 12:09.014
It's like a $50,000
lost and found.

12:09.049 --> 12:10.482
Here, try this one.

12:10.517 --> 12:12.218
Yup.

12:12.252 --> 12:13.519
You look great, Clifton.

12:13.553 --> 12:14.820
This doesn't fit!

12:14.854 --> 12:17.389
Eddie Pascucci beats up
the unstylish!

12:17.424 --> 12:18.524
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

12:18.558 --> 12:20.426
We had an ethnic, gay bully.

12:22.874 --> 12:24.657
He's gonna have
to come through me first.

12:25.198 --> 12:27.900
<i>Clifton Collins really just needed</i>
<i>someone to believe in him.</i>

12:27.934 --> 12:29.768
So I started tutoring
him in math,

12:29.803 --> 12:32.271
and he became the best
math student in school.

12:32.305 --> 12:33.465
So, let's look him up and see

12:33.474 --> 12:35.407
how happy and successful
and amazing he's doing.

12:35.442 --> 12:37.610
- Yeah!
- I think that'll really fire you up.

12:41.548 --> 12:42.909
All right,
there's no trace of him.

12:42.916 --> 12:44.383
- What?
- I'm really, I'm really good at this.

12:44.417 --> 12:46.018
I'm good at it, let me see.

12:46.052 --> 12:47.553
- You found him. He's right here.
- No, I didn't.

12:47.587 --> 12:49.197
- Here's Clifton, wow.
- It's not a...

12:49.347 --> 12:50.856
- Yeah, he's right there. That's Clifton.
- Oh, yeah.

12:50.890 --> 12:52.024
We're not the only ones
looking for him.

12:52.058 --> 12:53.489
- So's the FBI.
- What?

12:53.638 --> 12:55.628
- Yeah, he's a criminal.
- No.

12:55.662 --> 12:57.196
Oh, my God.

12:57.230 --> 13:00.199
Clifton "Baby Madoff" Collins?

13:00.233 --> 13:01.533
Wanted for 53...

13:02.269 --> 13:04.770
...counts of embezzlement.

13:04.804 --> 13:05.938
Sounds like the math took.

13:05.972 --> 13:07.906
Screw me.

13:07.941 --> 13:09.541
Like, I...

13:09.576 --> 13:12.077
Maybe I wasn't even
reaching the kids at all.

13:16.149 --> 13:18.384
Okay, you know what?

13:18.418 --> 13:20.419
- Miller up.
- Excuse me?

13:20.454 --> 13:22.655
That's just like "fill 'er up,"
but with "Miller."

13:22.689 --> 13:24.757
- Don't.
- 'Cause I'm about to fill you up.

13:24.791 --> 13:25.991
- No, that's gross.
- With my stories.

13:26.026 --> 13:27.393
- Oh, please don't.
- That's disgusting.

13:27.427 --> 13:29.061
What's disgusting about it?

13:29.095 --> 13:32.665
<i>My first year of law school,</i>
<i>I made an important discovery.</i>

13:32.699 --> 13:34.833
Look left. Look right.

13:34.868 --> 13:36.635
Next year, one of you will be gone.

13:36.670 --> 13:38.704
What a cliché, huh?

13:39.806 --> 13:41.807
Oh, you wrote that down.

13:44.611 --> 13:46.979
You'll be gone.
I'm not going anywhere.

13:47.013 --> 13:48.781
I'm gonna be fine.
I'm gonna be right here.

13:48.815 --> 13:50.449
Take it easy, guy to my right.

13:50.483 --> 13:54.486
<i>I discovered that I hated</i>
<i>being around these people.</i>

13:54.521 --> 13:56.755
<i>But second year,</i>
<i>I made another discovery.</i>

13:56.790 --> 13:58.257
<i>I hated being around myself.</i>

13:58.291 --> 13:59.858
<i>So my third year,</i>

13:59.893 --> 14:01.794
<i>I wanted to find</i>
<i>a place where I belonged.</i>

14:01.828 --> 14:03.462
<i>Where I could look to my left</i>

14:03.496 --> 14:05.130
<i>or look to my right</i>
<i>and like what I saw.</i>

14:05.164 --> 14:06.365
<i>Love you in that scarf.</i>

14:06.399 --> 14:07.366
<i>Why don't you wear</i>
<i>scarves anymore?</i>

14:07.400 --> 14:09.768
That place?
Perhaps you guessed it:

14:09.803 --> 14:11.303
<i>This very bar.</i>

14:11.338 --> 14:14.173
<i>Get out of town.</i>
<i>What a twist.</i>

14:17.877 --> 14:19.117
<i>How long has that</i>
<i>guy been here?</i>

14:19.145 --> 14:20.346
<i>Kevin-97?</i>

14:20.380 --> 14:21.680
Since 1997, Jess.

14:21.715 --> 14:23.115
Why else do you think
we would call him...

14:23.149 --> 14:24.950
I don't know.
Move it along, Miller.

14:24.984 --> 14:26.952
True, I wasn't
loving law school,

14:26.986 --> 14:29.288
but my grades were fine
and I even signed up

14:29.322 --> 14:30.689
for the California State Bar.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.292
<i>And then, one day...</i>

14:33.326 --> 14:37.196
<i>Red over-served himself</i>
<i>and everything changed.</i>

14:37.230 --> 14:38.697
<i>So you went behind the bar,</i>

14:38.732 --> 14:40.632
quit law school,
you became a bartender...

14:40.667 --> 14:42.611
- There's more to it than that.
- Two minutes!

14:42.751 --> 14:44.803
Oh, my God. I honestly don't
know what to do.

14:44.838 --> 14:45.838
I have so little time.

14:45.872 --> 14:46.839
Hey.

14:46.873 --> 14:47.940
Cece!

14:47.974 --> 14:49.842
Have you ever questioned
your entire career?

14:49.876 --> 14:52.211
Duh, I'm a 31 year old model.

14:52.245 --> 14:54.313
My last job was
for a phone sex ad,

14:54.347 --> 14:55.814
and I was the one calling.

14:55.849 --> 14:57.516
Tell me what to do.
And don't tell me

14:57.550 --> 14:59.051
to ask the guys, because
I already tried that.

14:59.085 --> 15:01.920
And also, don't tell me to think
about my first student, Clifton.

15:01.955 --> 15:02.921
Okay, no, wait.

15:02.956 --> 15:05.057
Your first student
was not Clifton.

15:10.697 --> 15:12.531
Lady, she's still
got one minute.

15:14.901 --> 15:16.635
That was a butt dial
from your mother.

15:16.670 --> 15:18.404
She is up to no good.

15:20.802 --> 15:23.249
Cece, bring it fast, and bring it hard.
You have 53 seconds.

15:29.383 --> 15:30.526
You okay?

15:30.679 --> 15:32.933
Yes. No.

15:33.221 --> 15:36.081
I think I need glasses unless
crying makes your eyes not work.

15:36.914 --> 15:40.492
I can't read this, but even
when I can, I don't understand it.

15:40.731 --> 15:43.862
Crying makes your eyes work better.
After I finished <i>Sophie's Choice</i>,

15:44.259 --> 15:45.683
I could see
in the dark for a week.

15:49.095 --> 15:50.754
Here's what I do
when I lose mine.

15:54.013 --> 15:57.220
Ooh, this is interesting.
Get in here, we'll learn it together.

15:57.562 --> 15:58.683
But everyone'll laugh at us.

15:58.717 --> 16:00.830
They can drive it or milk it
as far as I'm concerned.

16:02.221 --> 16:04.573
I don't know what that means.
I heard my dad say it.

16:09.136 --> 16:10.177
My dad just died.

16:13.104 --> 16:16.507
Well, if you want to come over,
and listen to mine say

16:16.567 --> 16:19.295
"They can drive it or milk it..."
you can.

16:19.935 --> 16:22.176
He's also got one
about the turds in City Hall.

16:23.883 --> 16:24.895
Thanks.

16:34.303 --> 16:36.174
- I'm Cece.
- Jess.

16:37.955 --> 16:40.136
I was your first student.

16:48.009 --> 16:50.212
Hey, Candace.
Um...

16:50.492 --> 16:54.332
Yeah, actually...
I'm not gonna take the job.

16:56.394 --> 16:58.408
Yeah, I'll see you Sunday.
Okay, bye.

16:59.320 --> 17:00.569
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

17:00.633 --> 17:02.598
- Thanks guys.
- Yes!

17:02.698 --> 17:05.747
- Thanks guys.
- You did it.

17:05.893 --> 17:07.160
Good stuff.

17:08.292 --> 17:10.050
Hey, she did it.

17:10.388 --> 17:12.108
You made the right call, Jess.
What's wrong?

17:12.196 --> 17:14.077
I think you're right.
I made the right decision.

17:17.262 --> 17:21.078
Look, I know it's hard,
but the hard is what...

17:21.374 --> 17:22.969
makes it good.

17:24.022 --> 17:26.448
- Is that from <i>A League of Their Own</i>.
- Uhm, <i>A League of Their Own</i>

17:26.602 --> 17:28.301
Yes, of course. All of my quotes
are from a sports movie.

17:28.443 --> 17:29.812
You guys don't know them,
and so they seem original.

17:29.953 --> 17:31.758
<i>A League of Their Own</i>
is not a sports movie.

17:31.874 --> 17:33.524
It's a sports movie,
first and foremost.

17:33.658 --> 17:35.494
It's about sisterhood
and the war.

17:35.633 --> 17:38.228
- Yeah, absolutely.
- It's about a baseball team grinding it up.

17:38.359 --> 17:41.921
♪ This used to be my playground... ♪

17:42.317 --> 17:43.300
Coming right up.

17:43.743 --> 17:45.843
His sister really worries
about his drinking, so what I do is

17:45.877 --> 17:49.979
I come in early, and I soak a teabag
until the water turns brown

17:50.014 --> 17:51.981
and looks like booze.

17:52.016 --> 17:53.350
I call it tea-water.

17:53.384 --> 17:56.186
So... tea.

17:56.220 --> 17:59.756
I will take a big old glass
of booze-water.

17:59.790 --> 18:01.858
Got an antacid
commercial tomorrow

18:01.892 --> 18:03.626
- Oof.
- and I'm playing day-old curry.

18:03.661 --> 18:05.795
Or you can bartend.

18:05.830 --> 18:08.298
You can bartend till
you're 90 years old.

18:08.332 --> 18:11.034
Why don't you fire this
down to Kevin-97?

18:15.873 --> 18:17.540
Oh, no.

18:18.909 --> 18:20.043
We're gonna work on that.

18:20.378 --> 18:21.544
Good morning, everybody.

18:21.579 --> 18:23.980
Welcome to Alge-Bio-Civics.

18:24.014 --> 18:24.981
Turn in your equations,

18:25.016 --> 18:27.050
and you will get a frog.

18:27.084 --> 18:29.119
Dissect carefully,
because inside the frog

18:29.153 --> 18:31.388
is the name of
the city council member

18:31.422 --> 18:34.190
who you will be e-mailing
to restart construction.

18:34.225 --> 18:35.425
- Ms. Day?
- Yes.

18:35.460 --> 18:37.527
I thought this was
gonna be a disaster.

18:37.561 --> 18:41.531
But thanks to you, I can go
upstairs to the big boys

18:41.565 --> 18:44.183
and tell them they
can always depend...

18:45.284 --> 18:47.475
on Dr. Alan Foster.

18:49.115 --> 18:50.272
Yeah.

18:50.875 --> 18:53.376
Please take his job,
I'm begging you.

18:53.411 --> 18:56.379
I'd do it myself, but I'd
never pass the psych test.

18:56.414 --> 18:58.081
<i>So I figure...</i>

18:58.115 --> 19:01.684
if Foster can be a principal,
then why can't I be a principal?

19:01.719 --> 19:03.086
- That's great.
- I don't see why not.

19:03.120 --> 19:04.387
- Thank you.
- Then you could take me

19:04.422 --> 19:06.389
to the principal's
office and punish me

19:06.424 --> 19:08.525
- for being tardy, and...
- You know we're right here, right?

19:08.559 --> 19:09.526
Just lift up my britches and...

19:09.560 --> 19:11.094
- We'll talk about it later.
- Okay.

19:11.128 --> 19:12.262
- We'll do it in my office.
- Very nice.

19:12.296 --> 19:13.556
After I fill up my juice box.

19:14.532 --> 19:16.866
So, guys, just quit
my job today.

19:16.901 --> 19:18.535
- Whoa, big decision.
- Oh, man! - What?

19:18.569 --> 19:19.869
I just finally said to myself,

19:19.904 --> 19:21.604
"It is time to make
your own decisions."

19:21.639 --> 19:22.639
- Right on.
- Yeah.

19:22.673 --> 19:25.273
If it doesn't work out, I'm sure
they'd be happy to have you back.

19:25.276 --> 19:27.043
They would... they would
not like to have me back.

19:27.078 --> 19:29.079
- I burned a lot of bridges today.
- Mmm.

19:29.113 --> 19:30.747
Uh, stuff got weird.
Stuff got... racial.

19:30.781 --> 19:32.482
- What?
- I used a lot of swearwords.

19:32.517 --> 19:33.950
Then I got sexual...

19:34.285 --> 19:36.386
Well, sounds like you need
a drink. On the house.

19:36.421 --> 19:39.055
- What can I get you?
- Ooh... Let me get a, let me get a...

19:39.090 --> 19:40.757
We have everything.
What would you like to drink?

19:40.791 --> 19:42.258
But you know,
I'll make the decision.

19:42.293 --> 19:43.693
Let me get...

19:44.496 --> 19:46.361
- Double amaretto, extra cherries!
- Double amaretto, extra cherries!

19:46.483 --> 19:47.297
That's what I was gonna say.

19:47.498 --> 19:49.065
Nice.

19:49.099 --> 19:51.401
- Oh, dear.
- Oh, my goodness!

19:51.435 --> 19:53.470
My first shift, you know?
I'm still working on it.

19:53.504 --> 19:55.138
- She's getting better.
- That was great.

19:55.172 --> 19:56.940
- That was awesome.
- Yeah. A natural.

19:59.645 --> 20:00.483
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:00.636 --> 20:02.579
Sorry I didn't let you
finish your story.

20:06.784 --> 20:09.018
- What's this?
- The end of my story.

20:11.755 --> 20:13.756
No way!

20:14.925 --> 20:16.893
You passed the bar exam?

20:16.927 --> 20:20.797
I wanted to prove to myself
that I dropped out of law school

20:20.831 --> 20:22.732
because I wanted
to be a bartender,

20:22.766 --> 20:24.934
not because
I couldn't be a lawyer.

20:24.969 --> 20:26.936
- This also says "spaghetti sandwich."
- That's just 'cause

20:26.971 --> 20:28.938
it's a great idea. When I have
a great idea, I write it down.

20:28.973 --> 20:30.907
The point is...

20:30.941 --> 20:32.475
is I want this.

20:32.510 --> 20:33.776
You know, it makes me happy.

20:33.811 --> 20:35.678
Well, here.

20:35.713 --> 20:38.114
Now, can I get you a drink?

20:38.148 --> 20:40.517
- Sure.
- Sure.

20:45.930 --> 20:47.422
Cheers.
To unemployment.

20:47.424 --> 20:49.058
- Absolutely.
- Exactly.

21:11.181 --> 21:13.816
I see you're looking
at a Douglas fir.

21:13.851 --> 21:14.851
It's a beautiful tree.

21:14.886 --> 21:17.120
We move a ton of these
Dougie firs. Love them.

21:17.154 --> 21:18.655
But...

21:18.689 --> 21:20.857
I feel like you're ready
for the spruce lifestyle.

21:20.891 --> 21:22.392
Let's spruce this up.

21:22.426 --> 21:24.193
Let me put you
in a spruce today.

21:24.228 --> 21:26.701
What kind of ceilings you dealing with
at home? Vaulted? Cathedral?

21:26.830 --> 21:27.807
By the way,
there's no wrong answer.

21:27.957 --> 21:29.717
You look like a confident man,
you know that?

21:29.762 --> 21:31.002
You deserve a confident tree...
