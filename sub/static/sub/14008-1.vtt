00:02.434 --> 00:04.334
You're special, Ellen...

00:04.370 --> 00:06.303
but that'll only make the fall harder.

00:06.371 --> 00:08.172
Once Patty meets you, there's no

00:08.173 --> 00:09.672
turning back.

00:09.673 --> 00:11.573
And she'll own you.

00:12.675 --> 00:14.476
No, I like Ellen.

00:14.477 --> 00:15.843
I think she's going to have

00:15.844 --> 00:17.979
a brilliant future.

00:18.047 --> 00:19.114
Working for Patty

00:19.115 --> 00:20.815
has taught me something about

00:20.816 --> 00:22.216
being a woman...

00:22.217 --> 00:24.653
You know what I'm in
the mood for? A fight.

00:24.654 --> 00:26.455
Your breach of trust...

00:26.456 --> 00:27.989
a professional

00:27.990 --> 00:30.225
You step in the ring with that woman,

00:30.226 --> 00:32.460
she will cut your balls off
and jam them down your throat.

00:32.461 --> 00:36.131
I don't like the way you do business,
but I get that it's necessary.

00:36.132 --> 00:39.668
Seeing how she balances
work and her personal life...

00:39.669 --> 00:42.572
People either leave you or they die.

00:42.573 --> 00:45.007
Those are the only two
endings possible with you.

00:45.008 --> 00:46.742
Get the hell out!

00:46.743 --> 00:49.211
What she prioritizes,
how she prioritizes...

00:49.212 --> 00:52.515
There's a difference between you and me.

00:52.583 --> 00:55.551
This isn't personal, Ellen.

00:55.552 --> 00:59.288
You've got to let things
just roll off your back.

00:59.289 --> 01:02.457
You are so full of shit, Patty.

01:02.458 --> 01:07.595
People like you and me, we only have
two options: forgiveness... revenge.

01:07.663 --> 01:10.298
I hope you know what you're doing.

01:10.299 --> 01:13.301
She's nothing less than
an inspiration to me.

01:16.638 --> 01:20.107
That's okay.

01:20.175 --> 01:24.444
I lied, too.

01:28.715 --> 01:32.050
No!

01:45.165 --> 01:47.868
I don't think we're
going to see her again.

01:48.471 --> 01:54.474
She'll be back. Trust me.

02:20.065 --> 02:22.500
Patty?

02:22.568 --> 02:26.404
I've been sitting at that table
all night hoping to get you alone.

02:26.405 --> 02:28.706
I'm sorry, I forgot your name.

02:28.707 --> 02:31.608
- Julian Decker.
- Oh, of course, Julian.

02:31.609 --> 02:35.446
And... remind me what you do.

02:35.514 --> 02:37.948
I'm sort of an architect.

02:39.084 --> 02:41.418
I've been watching you on TV lately.

02:41.419 --> 02:42.319
Have you?

02:42.320 --> 02:46.256
You're a real media darling.

02:46.257 --> 02:47.857
I'm just doing my job.

02:47.858 --> 02:51.061
Yeah, well, the thing
is, the lady I see on TV

02:51.128 --> 02:56.298
is not nearly as much fun as
the lady I met here tonight.

02:56.366 --> 02:58.266
Nice to meet you.

02:58.268 --> 02:59.535
Must be exhausting.

02:59.536 --> 03:01.436
What must be?

03:01.439 --> 03:03.106
Wearing that mask.

03:03.107 --> 03:05.808
Always having to play
the role of Patty Hewes.

03:05.809 --> 03:09.078
It's not a mask. What
you see is what you get.

03:09.079 --> 03:14.285
Right. So listen, why don't
you come across town with me?

03:14.352 --> 03:15.586
Why would I do that?

03:15.587 --> 03:18.155
Hear me play a set at Joe's Pub.

03:18.156 --> 03:20.625
Sorry. I have an early morning.

03:20.626 --> 03:22.426
You sure?

03:22.427 --> 03:25.363
Opportunity doesn't always knock twice.

03:25.364 --> 03:29.300
I'll take my chances.

03:32.004 --> 03:35.641
This attorney, Patty
Hewes, what a piece of work.

03:35.642 --> 03:38.110
Put aside those
victories in the Frobisher

03:38.111 --> 03:40.579
trial and against Ultima
National Resources,

03:40.646 --> 03:44.249
this woman's more
interested in God We Trust.

03:44.250 --> 03:47.218
That's right... ducketts,
cheddar, moola schmoola.

03:47.219 --> 03:48.987
It's really outrageous
for you to say that.

03:48.988 --> 03:49.921
I mean, here's a woman...

03:49.922 --> 03:51.990
And all you care about is
that 30 second sound bite

03:51.991 --> 03:54.059
in that press conference
announcing her victory.

03:54.060 --> 03:55.794
I care that she's the only
one with the courage to stand

03:55.795 --> 03:57.362
up to corporate America in an era

03:57.363 --> 03:58.930
where everyone else is afraid to so do.

03:58.931 --> 04:00.831
Thank God for Patty Hewes...

05:04.330 --> 05:07.699
Louis Tobin just got
sentenced to house arrest,

05:07.767 --> 05:12.738
and we're being hounded
to make a statement.

05:12.739 --> 05:14.874
Well, that's right,
Pat, I'm standing outside

05:14.875 --> 05:17.009
of Louis Tobin's Fifth
Avenue apartment building.

05:17.010 --> 05:20.280
Mr. Tobin has just been
sentenced to house arrest.

05:20.348 --> 05:23.350
This follows Mr. Tobin's
confession last month to

05:23.351 --> 05:26.621
operating the largest Ponzi
scheme in Wall Street history...

05:26.688 --> 05:28.990
bankrupting thousands of victims.

05:28.991 --> 05:31.293
Now despite Louis Tobin's
admission of guilt,

05:31.294 --> 05:33.662
the Tobin family has
issued no public statement

05:33.663 --> 05:36.031
nor any words of
remorse for his victims.

05:36.032 --> 05:39.117
It's still unclear whether
his son, Joseph Tobin, or

05:39.118 --> 05:42.203
the rest of the family,
was involved in the scheme.

05:42.204 --> 05:44.005
However, Leonard Winstone,

05:44.006 --> 05:46.291
the Tobin family attorney, claims each

05:46.292 --> 05:48.576
has rightfully maintained
their innocence.

05:48.577 --> 05:51.012
Louis Tobin has asked me
to emphatically restate

05:51.013 --> 05:54.115
that no other member of his
family has been indicted, or

05:54.116 --> 05:56.016
even was aware of his fraud.

05:56.051 --> 05:58.486
And today's events come just days before

05:58.487 --> 06:01.056
court-appointed trustee
Patricia Hewes is scheduled to

06:01.057 --> 06:04.225
formally begin her inquiry
into the Tobin family.

06:04.226 --> 06:06.126
Ms. Hewes had this to say.

06:06.129 --> 06:10.665
I intend to continue my
search into the funds stolen

06:10.733 --> 06:17.339
by Louis Tobin, and I hope to restore
financial health to his many victims.

06:17.340 --> 06:18.774
Surprise, surprise.

06:18.775 --> 06:20.609
Look who's stealing the spotlight again.

06:20.610 --> 06:22.978
Come on, give her some credit, Nick.

06:22.979 --> 06:25.714
You worked there. How does she do it?

06:25.715 --> 06:27.049
Do what?

06:27.050 --> 06:28.618
Rake in settlement after settlement

06:28.619 --> 06:30.186
without ever setting
foot in a courtroom.

06:30.187 --> 06:31.921
You never talk about her.

06:31.922 --> 06:35.625
The woman's good.

06:37.695 --> 06:39.864
Was she like this in law school?

06:39.865 --> 06:42.767
No idea. She never left the library.

06:42.768 --> 06:47.206
Well, the D.A.'s office is where
the real shit goes down, anyways.

06:47.207 --> 06:48.907
Patty can go after the money.

06:48.908 --> 06:53.246
My man Chris here is going to put
the whole Tobin family behind bars.

06:53.247 --> 06:55.582
I'm working on it.

06:56.751 --> 07:00.387
When was the last time
you spoke to Patty, anyway?

07:00.455 --> 07:04.157
I don't know. Almost a year ago.

07:04.158 --> 07:05.793
I called this group in today,

07:05.794 --> 07:10.364
because every major news
outlet is running your quotes.

07:10.432 --> 07:14.534
Louis Tobin stole everything I had.

07:14.602 --> 07:17.971
And maybe I shouldn't have
spoken to those reporters.

07:17.972 --> 07:22.908
But I am living on food stamps
now, and I am very angry.

07:22.976 --> 07:26.511
Going to the press is not
going to help your cause.

07:26.579 --> 07:28.246
You get me my money back,

07:28.247 --> 07:30.548
and then I won't have
to talk to the press.

07:30.549 --> 07:32.316
When the court appointed
us to oversee this process,

07:32.317 --> 07:34.585
we began by freezing
the family's accounts

07:34.586 --> 07:36.854
and confiscating their assets.

07:36.855 --> 07:39.106
Well, I've seen the son
at the grocery store.

07:39.107 --> 07:41.357
He seems to be doing just fine.

07:41.392 --> 07:43.894
I assure you... the entire
family is living on a

07:43.895 --> 07:46.263
minimal allowance until our
investigation is complete.

07:46.264 --> 07:49.066
And we'll be deposing them
over the next few weeks-

07:49.067 --> 07:50.801
starting with Mrs. Tobin.

07:50.802 --> 07:54.672
We're doing everything we
can to recover your funds.

07:54.673 --> 07:57.575
But we believe they've hidden money.

07:57.576 --> 07:59.677
A lot of money.

07:59.744 --> 08:02.513
Question four is out,
so is question five.

08:02.514 --> 08:05.750
I don't want Ms. Sawyer asking
any questions about my client's

08:05.751 --> 08:06.751
parents or his finances.

08:06.752 --> 08:09.653
Joe Tobin has personally
signed off on all of these.

08:09.655 --> 08:12.357
Well, he's clearly not in a proper
state of mind to make that decision.

08:12.358 --> 08:14.626
His wife feels otherwise.
She's given us carte blanche.

08:14.627 --> 08:17.295
Yeah, well, he's not going
to answer any of these.

08:17.296 --> 08:19.931
Mr. Winstone, this is Diane
Sawyer we're talking about here.

08:19.932 --> 08:21.266
- "Alvarez."
- Yes.

08:21.267 --> 08:22.701
Your parents are Spanish?

08:22.702 --> 08:25.370
My parents? They came
over from Honduras.

08:25.371 --> 08:26.838
But you live in this country?

08:26.839 --> 08:27.772
My whole life.

08:27.773 --> 08:29.440
Good, then you speak English.

08:29.441 --> 08:30.842
- Mr. Winstone...
- Dog shit.

08:30.843 --> 08:33.410
- Mr. Winstone...
- Dog shit!

08:33.412 --> 08:34.746
Thank you.

08:34.746 --> 08:36.147
I'm a cat guy.

08:36.148 --> 08:38.517
Cats you can teach to shit in a box.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.870
Mr. Winstone, if we can't ask
Joe Tobin about his father,

08:40.871 --> 08:43.222
there's really no point
in doing this interview.

08:43.222 --> 08:46.292
Well, I guess you'll have to tell
Ms. Sawyer that there's no interview.

08:46.293 --> 08:50.331
But I want you to know, if you
ever talk to my client again

08:50.398 --> 08:53.133
without me present, I'll have
your folks back in a boat to

08:53.134 --> 08:55.470
Honduras faster than you
can say "Tegucigalpa."

08:55.471 --> 08:59.140
You got that?

08:59.208 --> 09:00.908
Thanks for coming, Joe.

09:00.909 --> 09:02.977
We decided to talk on the record.

09:02.978 --> 09:04.979
I can't let you do that.

09:04.980 --> 09:08.617
People need to know that Joe had
nothing to do with his father's crime.

09:08.618 --> 09:10.618
I understand, Rachel.

09:10.619 --> 09:12.987
I want him to make a
public statement expressing

09:12.988 --> 09:15.356
our sympathy for the victims.

09:15.357 --> 09:16.390
And we will.

09:16.391 --> 09:19.526
But we need a controlled venue
where we vet the questions so

09:19.527 --> 09:22.396
nothing can be asked that
can compromise your family.

09:22.397 --> 09:28.902
Staying silent is compromising us.

09:28.970 --> 09:34.274
I need you to hang in
just a little longer.

09:34.342 --> 09:36.342
I can't. I'm sorry.

09:36.410 --> 09:39.112
Joe needs to do something.

09:39.180 --> 09:43.783
I can't allow Kevin to
live like this any longer.

09:43.851 --> 09:45.952
Come on, sweetie.

09:46.020 --> 09:48.455
Come on.

09:48.522 --> 09:54.461
Daddy needs to talk to Uncle Lenny.

10:03.838 --> 10:06.473
People are waiting to
pounce on any sign of guilt.

10:06.474 --> 10:08.341
You go on TV, you start

10:08.342 --> 10:11.111
sweating, your voice
cracks, they'll crucify you.

10:11.112 --> 10:15.082
I'm not sure how much more of
this my mother can take, Lenny.

10:15.083 --> 10:18.919
Look, Joe...

10:18.986 --> 10:20.954
Remember when you were
in elementary school?

10:20.955 --> 10:23.657
Wanted to turn in that
custodian who had stolen

10:23.658 --> 10:26.359
office supplies from the faculty lounge?

10:26.394 --> 10:29.062
It was a librarian.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.831
It was? Well...

10:31.898 --> 10:35.734
Either way, I know you.

10:35.802 --> 10:39.004
You always want to do
the right thing. I get it.

10:39.005 --> 10:41.339
So, you're... you're
asking me to do nothing.

10:41.340 --> 10:46.611
No. I'm asking you to just wait
until your father's sentenced.

10:46.679 --> 10:48.346
Once he's in prison, once the

10:48.347 --> 10:50.014
family's deposed and
your name is cleared,

10:50.015 --> 10:53.550
then the world is
ready to hear the truth.

10:53.586 --> 10:59.924
But if you don't let me do my job,
this can spiral out of control.

11:42.636 --> 11:45.572
Ms. Hewes.

11:45.639 --> 11:47.574
It's Victor... Huntley.

11:47.641 --> 11:49.309
We... we've met before.

11:49.310 --> 11:52.879
Yes. Yes, of course,
I... I remember you.

11:52.880 --> 11:56.950
I heard you went to the
hospital. Are you okay?

11:56.951 --> 11:58.785
Yeah, I think so.

11:58.786 --> 12:03.657
Yeah, I... I understand it
was quite a nasty car accident.

12:06.194 --> 12:08.429
Have you found out who hit me?

12:08.430 --> 12:12.033
No. Not yet.

12:12.101 --> 12:13.268
No, it's strange.

12:13.269 --> 12:16.672
Um, we canvassed the
neighborhood, but, uh, no one...

12:16.673 --> 12:19.107
nobody saw the... the other driver.

12:19.175 --> 12:24.112
Do you think this could've
been done to you on-on purpose?

12:34.521 --> 12:36.856
Roger, you gotta get some sleep.

12:36.857 --> 12:39.058
Yeah, I'd love to,

12:39.126 --> 12:41.845
but it seems that Louis Tobin
bent over, spread his ass and

12:41.846 --> 12:44.564
loosed his bowels over the
entire global investment system.

12:44.565 --> 12:46.433
You guys found more victims?

12:46.434 --> 12:50.437
Thousands more. $9.7 billion in losses.

12:50.504 --> 12:52.806
Jesus. You think this is everything?

12:52.807 --> 12:54.708
Oh, I seriously doubt it.

12:54.709 --> 12:58.512
The more I dig into Tobin's
muck, the more victims I discover.

12:58.513 --> 13:00.681
I don't know where this is going
to end, Tommy, but you mark my

13:00.682 --> 13:05.452
words, this mess is a whole
lot bigger than we can imagine.

13:05.520 --> 13:10.491
Well, hang in there.

13:10.559 --> 13:11.058
Patty.

13:11.059 --> 13:12.560
How's Roger holding up?

13:12.561 --> 13:14.562
He's fine. The man's a workhorse.

13:14.563 --> 13:15.062
Good.

13:15.063 --> 13:16.731
I hate to bring it up again.

13:16.732 --> 13:18.733
- What?
- Ellen's office.

13:18.734 --> 13:20.735
- What about it?
- It's been ten months.

13:20.736 --> 13:22.703
I don't think she's coming back.

13:22.771 --> 13:24.405
- Meaning?
- Nothing, except

13:24.406 --> 13:26.174
Roger's team could really use the space.

13:26.175 --> 13:27.942
I'd love to set him up in there.

13:27.943 --> 13:29.276
So do it.

13:29.277 --> 13:32.813
I can have it cleaned out? You sure?

13:32.814 --> 13:36.317
Ellen's gone. Clear it out.

13:45.593 --> 13:47.527
Hey, yo, check out this bike.

13:47.595 --> 13:50.863
Yo, man, don't even look at that.

14:22.097 --> 14:23.931
Congratulations.

14:23.932 --> 14:28.002
Donnie Rhyne, possession
with intent to distribute.

14:28.003 --> 14:30.504
This guy's looking at eight years.

14:30.505 --> 14:33.508
I'm not interested in Donnie
Rhyne. I want his supplier.

14:33.509 --> 14:36.911
I hate to spoil your fun, but
that ain't gonna happen this time.

14:36.912 --> 14:37.978
He's not going to flip.

14:37.979 --> 14:39.980
Why not?

14:40.048 --> 14:42.450
His lawyer's Ted Fratto.

14:42.451 --> 14:43.818
You ever hear of him?

14:43.819 --> 14:47.121
I know his reputation. But
I still like my chances.

14:47.122 --> 14:50.358
A hundred bucks says Donnie
won't give up his supplier.

14:50.359 --> 14:54.062
- Yeah?
- No?

14:54.130 --> 14:56.163
You're on.

14:59.401 --> 15:03.704
So possession with intent to distribute.

15:03.705 --> 15:08.509
That could get you
eight years, Mr. Rhyne.

15:08.511 --> 15:09.878
It's gonna rain, yo.

15:09.879 --> 15:12.347
Someone best get a tarp for my Harley.

15:12.348 --> 15:15.917
I made a call, Donnie. Someone
will take care of your bike.

15:15.918 --> 15:18.519
Bike belonged to my my
pops. Rode with the Angels.

15:18.520 --> 15:22.824
Well, if you want to wait eight
years to ride it again, be my guest.

15:22.825 --> 15:25.260
Or you could just tell
me who you're working for.

15:25.261 --> 15:26.862
You offering me a deal?

15:26.863 --> 15:28.763
Who's your supplier?

15:28.831 --> 15:32.166
A name will keep you out of jail,
bump you down to a misdemeanor.

15:32.167 --> 15:34.469
Yeah, then what happens?

15:34.470 --> 15:38.739
Doesn't matter. Mr. Rhyne
isn't interested in a deal.

15:38.807 --> 15:42.042
I'd like to hear that from Mr. Rhyne.

15:42.043 --> 15:45.879
Mr. Rhyne is not interested in a deal.

15:45.947 --> 15:48.732
If your attorney's making
promises in exchange

15:48.733 --> 15:51.517
for you keeping quiet,
then he's breaking the law.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.052
Watch it, Ms. Parsons.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.904
And if you're knowingly taking the fall

15:54.905 --> 15:56.755
for somebody else then
you're breaking the law.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.957
It's called obstruction of justice.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.960
Allows us to tack on more
time to those eight years.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.929
Wait, what's she saying?

16:03.930 --> 16:06.699
I'm saying that your lawyer
doesn't have your back, Donnie.

16:06.700 --> 16:09.401
Ms. Parsons, can I have a word?

16:13.607 --> 16:15.508
What the hell do you think you're doing?

16:15.509 --> 16:18.111
What you should be doing helping
your client stay out of jail.

16:18.112 --> 16:20.179
You're going to want to check that tone.

16:20.180 --> 16:21.548
You don't give a shit about Donnie.

16:21.549 --> 16:23.350
I know you're working for his supplier.

16:23.351 --> 16:25.503
You don't want to make
accusations like that,

16:25.504 --> 16:27.655
and you don't want to tamper
in my clients' affairs.

16:27.656 --> 16:30.892
I'm afraid they're a bunch of
real unsavory types, Ms. Parsons.

16:30.893 --> 16:33.995
The kind that can have a lot
of fun with a girl like you.

16:36.532 --> 16:38.967
We're done here, Donnie.

16:39.034 --> 16:41.435
Think about it, Mr. Rhyne.

16:41.436 --> 16:42.636
Don't say anything.

16:42.637 --> 16:46.372
You've got 48 hours. I
can make it all go away.

17:39.825 --> 17:43.728
Patty.

17:43.796 --> 17:45.464
You sure you're okay with this?

17:45.465 --> 17:48.066
Yeah.

17:48.134 --> 17:50.069
Get this stuff out of here.

17:52.773 --> 17:56.842
I want you to start
interviewing possible associates.

17:56.878 --> 17:58.845
We're going to bring on somebody new.

17:58.846 --> 18:00.746
Sure.

18:00.748 --> 18:02.683
Tom...

18:07.889 --> 18:09.456
What is it?

18:09.457 --> 18:12.893
How long have you been with me now?

18:12.961 --> 18:15.796
Oh, almost 11 years.

18:15.863 --> 18:20.032
And how many lawyers have gone
through the firm since then?

18:20.068 --> 18:21.402
A lot.

18:21.403 --> 18:23.805
A lot, Patty.

18:23.872 --> 18:30.179
But you... you made it through.

18:30.246 --> 18:32.681
What's your point?

18:32.749 --> 18:38.688
It's time to put your name on the door.

18:38.756 --> 18:41.857
You don't like the idea?

18:41.925 --> 18:44.827
No, I mean, yeah, yeah, uh...

18:44.828 --> 18:46.461
Absolutely.

18:46.462 --> 18:48.997
Thank you.

18:49.065 --> 18:50.564
Thanks, Patty. I...

18:50.565 --> 18:53.701
So we're ready for the deposition?

18:53.702 --> 18:56.437
Ms. Tobin is all set up
in the conference room.

18:56.438 --> 18:58.372
Good.

19:00.809 --> 19:03.661
Mrs. Tobin, do you have
any reason to believe

19:03.662 --> 19:06.514
that your son was privy
to your husband's fraud?

19:06.515 --> 19:07.615
Absolutely not.

19:07.616 --> 19:09.117
My son knew nothing.

19:09.118 --> 19:12.788
When was the last time you saw your son?

19:12.856 --> 19:14.757
Thanksgiving.

19:14.824 --> 19:20.128
Mr. Winstone advised us not
to have contact after that.

19:30.538 --> 19:34.508
That's the floor shaking with laughter.

19:37.612 --> 19:42.016
I... I know you're not supposed
to do this with water, but...

19:42.083 --> 19:44.118
Happy Thanksgiving.

19:44.186 --> 19:50.258
Lord knows, I have a
lot to be thankful for.

19:50.326 --> 19:52.595
I'm terrible at speeches, so...

19:52.663 --> 19:54.997
You all heard his toast at my wedding.

19:54.998 --> 19:56.566
I froze a little bit.

19:56.567 --> 19:58.467
I froze a lot of bit.

19:59.570 --> 20:02.605
Um... I'll keep it simple.

20:02.673 --> 20:04.873
I love you all.

20:07.977 --> 20:09.477
Cheers.

20:09.478 --> 20:12.413
Cheers.

20:12.481 --> 20:14.415
Thank you, son.

20:17.685 --> 20:21.455
So you had no hint of what was to come?

20:21.456 --> 20:24.857
Your husband didn't seem anxious?

20:24.859 --> 20:27.761
He may have been more
emotional than usual.

20:27.762 --> 20:30.664
Other than that, it was
like any other Thanksgiving.

20:30.732 --> 20:34.368
And when did that change?

20:34.436 --> 20:36.904
Somewhere around the pie.

20:36.905 --> 20:38.039
One, two, three.

20:38.040 --> 20:40.575
I'm cleaning you out.

20:40.576 --> 20:43.878
One, two...

20:43.946 --> 20:46.014
Oh, mine.

20:46.082 --> 20:47.749
One, two, three.

20:47.750 --> 20:49.718
Louis?

20:49.786 --> 20:52.221
Sweetheart, are you okay?

20:56.226 --> 20:59.628
I'm sorry, Rachel.

20:59.696 --> 21:02.865
Could you give me just a
few minutes with my family?

21:02.866 --> 21:03.933
She is family.

21:03.934 --> 21:06.035
Dad, what are you doing?

21:06.102 --> 21:08.736
Maybe you could take Kevin upstairs.

21:08.772 --> 21:11.539
Let him feed the fish.

21:11.607 --> 21:14.075
Of course. Yeah, that would be fun.

21:14.076 --> 21:16.844
Yeah. Feed the fish. Come on, sweetie.

21:16.845 --> 21:18.780
What happened?

21:18.847 --> 21:20.816
Daddy?

21:20.883 --> 21:22.818
Dad?

21:24.254 --> 21:26.355
And that's when he told us.

21:26.356 --> 21:28.057
About the fraud?

21:28.058 --> 21:29.392
That is was a Ponzi scheme?

21:29.393 --> 21:30.961
Yes.

21:30.962 --> 21:33.464
He said the business was all a lie.

21:33.465 --> 21:35.065
The investments weren't real.

21:35.066 --> 21:38.303
He said he couldn't hide it anymore.

21:38.304 --> 21:42.572
Your son Joe contacted the
district attorney the next morning.

21:42.608 --> 21:45.611
- Isn't that right?
- Yes.

21:45.678 --> 21:47.846
Did that make you angry?

21:47.847 --> 21:50.615
What my son does is his own business.

21:50.616 --> 21:52.517
Joe worked for your husband.

21:52.518 --> 21:54.152
Do you think he knew about the scheme?

21:54.153 --> 21:56.155
Objection. Calls for speculation.

21:56.156 --> 21:58.924
Mrs. Tobin can't be expected to
guess what's in her son's head.

21:58.925 --> 22:02.260
You are going to depose Joe. Ask him.

22:02.261 --> 22:06.263
Mrs. Tobin, you say that you knew
nothing about your husband's fraud.

22:06.264 --> 22:07.531
Yes.

22:07.532 --> 22:11.151
You shared your life with
him for over 40 years,

22:11.152 --> 22:14.771
and yet you didn't know
that he was stealing?

22:14.839 --> 22:16.906
Actually, I...

22:16.974 --> 22:18.708
I'm so sorry.

22:18.709 --> 22:21.110
Darling, can you get me an Earl

22:21.178 --> 22:23.879
Grey
- no sugar, dash of skim?

22:23.947 --> 22:26.182
We'll get that for you.

22:26.183 --> 22:27.717
Would you, please? Thank you.

22:27.718 --> 22:29.952
Make sure it's skim.

22:30.020 --> 22:31.654
I need caffeine.

22:31.655 --> 22:33.122
God, I was up till 3:00, making

22:33.123 --> 22:35.024
Jell-O for my grandson.

22:35.092 --> 22:36.893
You know, safari animals.

22:36.894 --> 22:40.597
With that mold we bought
in Tanzania, remember?

22:40.598 --> 22:44.034
That little boy, the village
boy with the cleft palate.

22:48.140 --> 22:49.674
I'm sorry.

22:49.675 --> 22:51.209
What was the question?

22:51.210 --> 22:55.114
$70 billion went through
your husband's fund.

22:55.181 --> 22:57.449
Don't you think it inconceivable that he

22:57.450 --> 22:59.718
didn't tuck some of
that away for the family?

23:01.420 --> 23:03.988
I live on tuna, Ms. Hewes.

23:04.056 --> 23:07.091
Two cans a day since you
seized all our assets.

23:07.092 --> 23:09.410
If my husband stashed
money, he certainly

23:09.411 --> 23:11.728
never told me where he put it.

23:11.729 --> 23:15.698
You claim that your husband didn't
lay any money away for your family.

23:15.699 --> 23:16.766
That's right.

23:16.767 --> 23:19.703
I'm confused. How could
you know that for certain?

23:19.704 --> 23:22.438
You want to get a waterboard?

23:22.874 --> 23:26.110
You know, you've been questioning
my client for over five hours now.

23:26.111 --> 23:28.613
We're going in a
circle, don't you think?

23:28.614 --> 23:29.982
It's okay, Lenny.

23:29.983 --> 23:33.653
This is the most interesting
conversation I've had in months.

23:33.720 --> 23:36.923
My friends won't talk
to me, or my children.

23:36.924 --> 23:40.093
My lawyer advises me not
to speak to my husband.

23:40.094 --> 23:42.995
I can't get my hair done.
I can't eat at a restaurant.

23:42.996 --> 23:44.930
I can't go to the theater.

23:48.034 --> 23:51.970
I like you, Ms. Hewes.

23:52.037 --> 23:56.073
You know what it's like to
have a husband who betrays you.

23:56.141 --> 24:00.277
You know about my divorce.

24:00.278 --> 24:03.481
I read that he cheated on you.

24:03.482 --> 24:06.285
I wasn't terribly surprised.

24:06.286 --> 24:09.889
So you understand that
men have their secrets.

24:09.957 --> 24:12.559
Yes.

24:12.627 --> 24:14.227
But so do women.

24:14.228 --> 24:18.700
And I find that women are
better at keeping them.

24:26.374 --> 24:34.280
D... do you think this may have
been done to you on... on purpose?

24:34.348 --> 24:37.649
I have no idea.

24:39.085 --> 24:40.985
Detective.

24:41.021 --> 24:42.956
Excuse me.

24:47.027 --> 24:49.563
I tracked the VIN on the
car that hit Ms. Hewes.

24:49.564 --> 24:51.565
Did you find who it's registered to?

24:51.566 --> 24:53.767
Yeah, got a name and address.

24:53.768 --> 24:55.703
Who's the owner?

24:57.539 --> 24:59.474
Thomas Shayes.

25:01.110 --> 25:03.478
Where does it say that?

25:03.479 --> 25:04.345
There.

25:04.346 --> 25:06.281
Registered to Thomas Shayes.

25:12.256 --> 25:14.190
Yeah?

25:16.060 --> 25:20.763
A contact of mine just told me
Joe Tobin reached out to ABC.

25:20.798 --> 25:22.232
What for?

25:22.233 --> 25:25.135
He wanted to do an
interview with Diane Sawyer.

25:25.203 --> 25:26.604
Set the record straight.

25:26.605 --> 25:28.606
But his lawyers shut it
down at the last second.

25:28.607 --> 25:30.974
The pressure's getting to Joe.

25:30.975 --> 25:33.560
If he reached out to the press,

25:33.561 --> 25:36.146
could be he's willing
to break from the family.

25:36.147 --> 25:38.382
Well, his mother won't
tell us the truth.

25:38.383 --> 25:41.018
Maybe we can get it from him.

25:42.620 --> 25:44.187
Ellen.

25:44.188 --> 25:45.154
Hey, boss.

25:45.155 --> 25:47.289
This came for you.

25:47.357 --> 25:50.159
It's from Hewes & Associates.

25:50.226 --> 25:52.461
Do you have any idea what it might be?

25:52.462 --> 25:54.395
No, none.

25:57.199 --> 26:02.404
Uh, listen, I know you have a
relationship with Patty Hewes,

26:02.405 --> 26:07.610
but maintaining confidentiality
in this office is imperative.

26:07.611 --> 26:08.945
Of course.

26:08.946 --> 26:12.499
I have no desire to pry into your
personal life, but I have to ask you

26:12.500 --> 26:16.053
to use discretion if you speak with
her about the Tobin investigation.

26:16.054 --> 26:19.290
We don't talk anymore.

26:19.291 --> 26:20.892
So it won't be a problem.

26:20.893 --> 26:23.494
All right.

26:23.562 --> 26:24.829
Good.

26:24.830 --> 26:28.232
Ah, I hate conversations like this.

26:28.233 --> 26:30.868
I just needed to know you
and I were on the same page.

26:30.869 --> 26:31.902
We are, absolutely.

26:31.903 --> 26:33.838
Okay.

26:44.950 --> 26:46.884
You Joe Tobin?

26:51.957 --> 26:55.526
You assholes took everything I own.

27:00.132 --> 27:01.666
Hey.

27:01.667 --> 27:03.935
I'm... I'm sorry.

27:04.003 --> 27:06.137
Oh, really? Are you?

27:06.205 --> 27:07.639
Yes, I am.

27:07.640 --> 27:08.673
Hey.

27:08.674 --> 27:09.307
Whoa. Okay.

27:09.308 --> 27:10.675
Easy, all right?

27:10.676 --> 27:13.111
Look me in the face, Joe. Come on.

27:13.112 --> 27:17.615
If you lost money with my
father, I'm sorry. Okay?

27:17.683 --> 27:19.617
I... I'm truly sorry.

27:19.685 --> 27:21.519
Sorry, Bobby.

27:21.520 --> 27:24.355
Hey, dickhead!

27:24.423 --> 27:27.292
Buy me my goddamn groceries.

27:27.360 --> 27:28.492
Look at me.

27:28.493 --> 27:29.627
Hey, hey, hey.

27:29.628 --> 27:32.197
Please stop, okay?

27:32.264 --> 27:34.164
Tell me to stop...

27:42.074 --> 27:44.608
Why can't you stop?

27:44.676 --> 27:46.811
Shit. Shit!

27:46.878 --> 27:48.813
Asshole.

27:59.157 --> 28:01.492
I really don't understand
your position on this.

28:01.493 --> 28:04.193
It's my client's
position; it is not mine.

28:04.229 --> 28:05.880
He won't press charges even though there

28:05.881 --> 28:07.531
were witnesses there
when Tobin assaulted him.

28:07.532 --> 28:08.866
I told him.

28:08.867 --> 28:10.968
He's not interested.

28:11.036 --> 28:13.137
That's all there is to it?

28:13.138 --> 28:14.972
What are you implying?

28:14.973 --> 28:18.276
I just... I'd hate to find
out you're playing games.

28:18.277 --> 28:20.211
Games?

28:20.279 --> 28:22.179
You overestimate me, Mr. Gates.

28:22.181 --> 28:24.383
You and I should be
working together on this.

28:24.384 --> 28:26.885
I build the criminal case, you
recover the money for the victim.

28:26.886 --> 28:28.620
That's all I want to do.

28:28.621 --> 28:30.923
Well, this could be my way in, right?

28:30.924 --> 28:33.560
Put some pressure on Joe Tobin, find
out if he's involved with the fraud.

28:33.561 --> 28:35.562
I can't do it if he won't press charges.

28:35.563 --> 28:39.667
I don't know what to tell
you. He's made up his mind.

28:41.336 --> 28:46.273
Okay, well, then... this is now
officially a waste of my time.

28:53.214 --> 28:55.982
Thank you for letting
Tobin do this to you.

28:55.983 --> 28:57.183
Not a problem.

28:57.184 --> 28:59.719
But why don't you put Tobin in jail?

28:59.720 --> 29:03.555
Because I think he's more
useful to us out in the world.

29:03.556 --> 29:04.756
I appreciate your help.

29:04.757 --> 29:08.559
I hope you get what you
need from the little prick.

29:23.908 --> 29:26.709
Thank you for meeting me.

29:26.710 --> 29:29.646
I miss you, Joe.

29:29.714 --> 29:32.149
Kevin and Rachel, too.

29:37.655 --> 29:39.657
How did your deposition go?

29:39.658 --> 29:41.358
Oh, Lenny thinks I did really well.

29:41.359 --> 29:42.960
Good.

29:42.961 --> 29:45.964
She's not particularly
sharp, that woman.

29:47.767 --> 29:50.602
Lenny tells me you still
won't visit your father.

29:50.603 --> 29:51.770
Christ.

29:51.771 --> 29:55.942
It would mean so much to him. It would
lift his spirits. Can't you just...?

29:55.943 --> 30:00.346
Mom... no.

30:00.414 --> 30:04.550
How's my grandson?

30:04.618 --> 30:06.418
He's... he's fine.

30:06.419 --> 30:10.422
When do I get to see him again?

30:10.490 --> 30:13.826
I need you to tell me
everything you know.

30:13.827 --> 30:16.729
He must have prepared for this.

30:16.796 --> 30:18.731
I wish he had.

30:18.798 --> 30:20.799
Did he leave us any money?

30:20.800 --> 30:25.103
If he'd left us money, don't
you think he would have told you?

30:25.104 --> 30:26.104
Damn.

30:26.105 --> 30:27.506
Don't smoke another one.

30:27.507 --> 30:30.075
You know...

30:30.142 --> 30:34.512
when you, uh, said you
wanted to meet me...

30:37.148 --> 30:39.282
I thought you were reaching out.

30:39.283 --> 30:42.887
I am. I'm asking you to
tell me the truth about him.

30:42.888 --> 30:45.923
And I have.

30:45.991 --> 30:49.861
Thanksgiving night?

30:49.928 --> 30:51.862
Who did he call?

30:54.199 --> 30:55.733
I saw it.

30:55.734 --> 30:57.902
Dad? You all right?

30:59.071 --> 31:01.640
Dad?

31:01.708 --> 31:03.642
Give it to me.

31:07.815 --> 31:10.718
Who did he call?

31:10.785 --> 31:12.920
I don't know.

31:12.988 --> 31:14.989
We need to give them something.

31:14.990 --> 31:16.724
We need to cooperate.

31:16.725 --> 31:18.893
Otherwise, we can't clear our name.

31:18.894 --> 31:20.095
Who did he call?

31:20.096 --> 31:22.430
It won't make a difference.

31:22.431 --> 31:23.798
Mom.

31:23.799 --> 31:28.036
Please leave it alone.

31:28.104 --> 31:30.990
If you don't tell me who he called,

31:30.991 --> 31:33.876
you'll never see your grandson again.

31:50.663 --> 31:52.697
You want the truth?

31:56.603 --> 31:58.538
Here it is.

32:18.224 --> 32:19.824
Here you go.

32:19.825 --> 32:21.659
Thank you.

32:21.660 --> 32:24.028
Have they found the driver yet?

32:24.095 --> 32:26.463
Not to my knowledge.

32:26.531 --> 32:28.431
Where's Detective Huntley?

32:28.432 --> 32:32.435
Ma'am, he said, "Sit
tight." He'll be back.

32:37.239 --> 32:39.139
Mr. Shayes?

32:39.175 --> 32:42.310
Thomas Shayes?

32:42.378 --> 32:44.278
It's the police.

32:45.715 --> 32:50.853
Are you sure this is where
the car was registered?

33:19.651 --> 33:23.387
What do you think these are?

33:38.469 --> 33:40.002
Tom Shayes!

33:40.003 --> 33:43.106
Hey.

33:43.173 --> 33:44.540
Good to see you.

33:44.541 --> 33:46.208
I was surprised you called.

33:46.209 --> 33:50.111
I was organizing my contacts,
and I figured, "What the hell?"

33:50.112 --> 33:53.181
So, how's life at Hewes & Associates?

33:53.182 --> 33:55.583
It's good, it's, uh...
it's great, actually.

33:55.584 --> 33:58.786
Uh, Patty's putting my name on the wall.

33:58.787 --> 34:00.521
- Hewes & Shayes?
- Yeah.

34:00.522 --> 34:01.956
That's fantastic! Congratulations.

34:01.957 --> 34:05.727
Thanks. And you, you're... you're,
uh, working Narcotics at the D.A.'s?

34:05.728 --> 34:07.963
Yeah, working on a
felony drug conviction.

34:07.964 --> 34:08.697
Exciting.

34:08.697 --> 34:12.935
Not at the moment. We're trying to get
a drug dealer to give up his supplier.

34:12.936 --> 34:14.235
He's not biting?

34:14.237 --> 34:16.371
I offered a deal, but
time's running out,

34:16.373 --> 34:18.507
and we don't have enough leverage.

34:18.507 --> 34:21.177
Well, you'll figure out something.

34:21.178 --> 34:24.581
I've been wanting to
talk to you for a while,

34:24.648 --> 34:26.783
to apologize, actually.

34:26.850 --> 34:28.518
About what?

34:28.518 --> 34:31.804
The day your son was
born, the FBI arrested

34:31.806 --> 34:35.092
you and you missed his birth.

34:35.159 --> 34:37.661
I hated being a part of that.

34:37.730 --> 34:44.335
Well, in the end, you had my back.

34:45.938 --> 34:47.839
Sorry.

34:49.175 --> 34:51.944
Oh, shoot, my meeting got bumped up.

34:51.945 --> 34:53.277
Where you headed?

34:53.279 --> 34:54.647
You?

34:54.648 --> 34:55.813
Downtown.

34:55.815 --> 34:59.117
Mm. Well, good luck on your case.

34:59.118 --> 35:03.621
And, you know, if you're up for
it, let's grab dinner sometime.

35:03.689 --> 35:05.123
Yes, let's do it.

35:05.124 --> 35:06.257
That'd be great.

35:06.258 --> 35:07.825
I'll see you, Tom.

35:07.826 --> 35:10.060
Okay.

35:10.128 --> 35:11.895
Hey...

35:11.896 --> 35:17.300
I know you didn't ask about it,
and I don't even know if you care.

35:17.301 --> 35:18.301
About what?

35:18.302 --> 35:23.005
Patty. God knows she'd
never say anything, but...

35:23.006 --> 35:25.575
she'd love to have you back.

35:25.643 --> 35:30.613
There's always a place
for you at Hewes & Shayes.

35:30.681 --> 35:32.715
Thanks, Tom.

35:32.783 --> 35:34.517
It's nice to hear.

35:34.518 --> 35:36.919
But I've moved on.

35:42.792 --> 35:46.361
Hi, Perry.

35:46.429 --> 35:48.929
Yeah, uh, send him up.

35:50.498 --> 35:52.799
You know, you really
shouldn't have come here.

35:52.800 --> 35:56.303
Well, I couldn't go to your office.

35:56.370 --> 36:00.539
My attorney wouldn't want me
to have any contact with you.

36:00.540 --> 36:02.208
I can understand that.

36:02.209 --> 36:07.179
I've ignored his advice
once as it is, so...

36:07.247 --> 36:08.414
How's that?

36:08.415 --> 36:11.351
I spoke to my mother.

36:11.418 --> 36:17.124
She didn't tell you everything
that happened on Thanksgiving.

36:17.191 --> 36:22.831
After he confessed to us, I
saw my father make a phone call.

36:22.832 --> 36:24.566
He doesn't know I saw him.

36:24.567 --> 36:26.835
Well, do you know who he called?

36:26.836 --> 36:31.541
No, but my mother does.

36:31.609 --> 36:33.810
I got her to...

36:33.878 --> 36:35.345
give me this.

36:35.346 --> 36:37.014
You recognize the number?

36:37.015 --> 36:37.715
No.

36:37.716 --> 36:39.650
Did you try to call it?

36:39.651 --> 36:42.737
If this number has anything
to do with my father's fraud,

36:42.738 --> 36:45.823
I don't want to know
who's on the other end.

36:45.890 --> 36:50.127
So that's why you're here.

36:50.194 --> 36:53.663
I assaulted a man, Ms. Hewes.

36:53.698 --> 36:57.034
I assaulted a man.

36:57.102 --> 37:01.104
I don't want to live like this anymore.

37:01.172 --> 37:04.107
So...

37:04.175 --> 37:08.578
if I give you this number,
I want something in return.

37:08.646 --> 37:12.866
I want you to tell
the press and the D.A.

37:12.867 --> 37:17.087
that I cooperated and
that I knew nothing...

37:20.224 --> 37:22.659
and that I'm trying to help.

37:22.726 --> 37:27.798
Well, if that turns out to be
the truth, it will be my pleasure.

37:27.799 --> 37:33.470
Ms. Hewes, my father
and I were very close.

37:36.474 --> 37:38.776
At least I thought we were.

37:42.447 --> 37:44.148
Thank you for this.

37:44.149 --> 37:46.183
I wouldn't get your hopes up.

37:46.184 --> 37:48.084
My father didn't hide any money.

37:51.256 --> 37:53.691
Man left us with nothing.

38:36.866 --> 38:41.236
Yo, yo, what are you doing, man?!

38:41.304 --> 38:44.705
Keep your mouth shut, asshole.

38:44.773 --> 38:46.974
Jesus.

38:47.041 --> 38:49.342
Goddamn!

38:52.980 --> 38:55.581
Congratulations. Hundred bucks.

38:55.582 --> 38:56.415
Donnie flipped?

38:56.416 --> 38:59.017
He fired his attorney.
Now he wants to talk.

38:59.018 --> 39:00.085
What happened?

39:00.086 --> 39:03.272
Apparently, that supplier was
worried Donnie wasn't gonna keep

39:03.273 --> 39:06.459
his mouth shut, sent a couple
punks over to threaten him.

39:06.460 --> 39:09.797
They, uh, totaled Donnie's
Harley with a baseball bat.

39:09.798 --> 39:11.132
Really?

39:11.133 --> 39:14.770
But they didn't intimidate
him. It just pissed him off.

39:14.771 --> 39:16.405
Doesn't make sense.

39:16.406 --> 39:18.941
Just pushed Donnie
too far. It backfired.

39:18.942 --> 39:25.947
Ellen... those guys
with bats, did you...?

39:26.015 --> 39:28.582
Did I what?

39:28.650 --> 39:31.084
You know.

39:31.152 --> 39:34.054
Right.

39:34.122 --> 39:36.056
Right.

39:39.159 --> 39:41.161
Very nice.

39:41.228 --> 39:43.163
Donnie joined your team.

39:43.231 --> 39:46.300
Feel like I'm the last
person to know about this.

39:46.301 --> 39:47.468
Who's the box from?

39:47.469 --> 39:49.604
Patty, I guess.

39:49.672 --> 39:51.439
You gonna open it?

39:51.440 --> 39:55.110
I was thinking I might just toss it.

39:55.178 --> 39:56.178
Come on.

39:56.179 --> 39:59.348
You aren't curious?

39:59.416 --> 40:01.917
Knock yourself out.

40:15.796 --> 40:18.364
What's the occasion?

40:26.573 --> 40:27.973
There isn't any.

40:27.974 --> 40:30.942
What, she just sent it
to you for no reason?

40:30.943 --> 40:34.112
Patty always has a reason.

40:44.323 --> 40:46.223
Gonna keep it?

41:16.155 --> 41:19.057
I can see you in there.

41:19.058 --> 41:22.560
Why don't you come out?

41:22.628 --> 41:25.796
Like to ask you a couple questions.

41:25.798 --> 41:26.898
You guys cops?

41:26.899 --> 41:29.434
Detectives Trammell and Huntley.

41:29.435 --> 41:31.503
Huntley. That Irish?

41:31.571 --> 41:35.306
Welsh.

41:35.374 --> 41:38.009
All right, I'll trust a Welshman.

41:38.010 --> 41:40.578
- Who you looking for?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, easy!

41:40.579 --> 41:42.580
- All you gotta do is ask!
- What are you doing, man?

41:42.581 --> 41:47.518
Okay, what do you got in there?

41:47.586 --> 41:50.154
What are you looking for?

41:53.592 --> 41:55.492
I only take cash.

41:57.596 --> 41:59.230
How much for that?

41:59.231 --> 42:02.133
No, no, no, no, no, no,
this beauty's not for sale.

42:02.134 --> 42:03.668
Oh, no?

42:03.669 --> 42:05.570
That's too bad.

42:05.637 --> 42:08.573
Oh, come on, man.

42:12.312 --> 42:15.782
Why don't you tell
us where you got this?

42:39.238 --> 42:41.172
Joe.

42:44.244 --> 42:46.178
Jesus.

42:46.246 --> 42:47.613
What's going on?

42:47.614 --> 42:50.917
I need you to come with me.

43:13.108 --> 43:14.209
Hey, Tom.

43:14.210 --> 43:16.344
It's Ellen.

43:25.087 --> 43:28.123
Drinking alone.

43:28.191 --> 43:30.760
I'm sorry, what was your name again?

43:30.761 --> 43:32.895
Julian Decker.

43:32.963 --> 43:34.430
Oh, right.

43:34.431 --> 43:36.933
The sort-of architect.

43:37.001 --> 43:38.601
Buy you another?

43:38.602 --> 43:40.336
No, thank you.

43:40.337 --> 43:43.172
Two bourbons.

43:43.240 --> 43:45.474
What's with the puss?

43:45.542 --> 43:47.442
Beg your pardon?

43:47.477 --> 43:48.878
The face.

43:48.879 --> 43:50.812
You look troubled.

43:53.449 --> 43:55.684
I think you're just lonely.

43:55.752 --> 43:58.186
Got no one to talk to.

43:58.254 --> 44:00.455
And you're going to fill the void?

44:00.456 --> 44:03.992
Crazier things have happened.

44:04.060 --> 44:05.995
Not to me.

44:08.632 --> 44:10.532
What's this?

44:10.568 --> 44:13.036
My measurements.

44:13.104 --> 44:16.340
Seriously, whose number is it?

44:37.761 --> 44:39.695
Well...

44:42.266 --> 44:43.499
I called Tom.

44:43.500 --> 44:47.103
He told me I could find you here.

44:47.171 --> 44:52.609
I wasn't sure I'd ever see you again.

44:52.677 --> 44:55.545
So how's it going at the D.A.'s office?

44:55.546 --> 44:57.013
Good.

44:57.014 --> 44:58.982
Curtis Gates is a great boss.

44:59.050 --> 45:00.884
He's very complimentary of my work.

45:00.885 --> 45:02.019
I'm glad to hear that.

45:02.020 --> 45:03.053
Yeah.

45:03.054 --> 45:05.523
A dealer flipped in my narcotics case.

45:05.524 --> 45:08.159
He gave up his supplier, and
I'm getting all the credit.

45:08.160 --> 45:09.894
Congratulations.

45:09.895 --> 45:12.765
The only problem is, I
had nothing to do with it.

45:12.766 --> 45:14.099
No?

45:14.100 --> 45:18.438
No, but I think you did.

45:21.075 --> 45:24.076
I'm flattered, but
you're being paranoid.

45:24.077 --> 45:26.278
I could have done it myself, Patty,

45:26.279 --> 45:28.480
but I don't want to
work that way anymore.

45:28.481 --> 45:30.315
Ellen, why would I
interfere with your case?

45:30.316 --> 45:32.450
That's a good question.
Here's another one.

45:32.451 --> 45:34.285
Why would you send me that gift?

45:34.286 --> 45:37.755
I thought you'd like it.

45:37.822 --> 45:39.590
What do you want from me?

45:39.591 --> 45:42.594
Nothing.

45:42.661 --> 45:46.165
You don't have to worry
about me. I forgave you.

45:46.166 --> 45:48.234
All your secrets are safe.

45:50.804 --> 45:55.576
So we can just get on with our lives.

45:55.643 --> 46:00.715
Well, did you like the bag?

46:00.783 --> 46:02.250
It's a $3,000

46:02.251 --> 46:04.753
Chanel.

46:04.820 --> 46:06.655
Yeah, I liked it.

46:06.656 --> 46:08.556
Good.

46:08.591 --> 46:12.360
I wasn't sure if it was your taste.

46:12.428 --> 46:14.362
It's good to see you.

46:17.933 --> 46:20.668
Patty...

46:20.736 --> 46:25.173
If you want to talk to
me, don't play games.

46:25.241 --> 46:29.010
You could just pick up the phone, call.

46:39.655 --> 46:44.792
So you have no idea
where this came from?

46:44.860 --> 46:47.928
I don't remember; it
might have been a gift.

46:47.996 --> 46:50.230
A gift, huh?

46:50.298 --> 46:54.200
It's not really your style.

46:54.268 --> 46:56.302
Vic.

46:56.369 --> 46:58.838
You want to look at this?

46:58.905 --> 47:01.307
Excuse me.

47:19.659 --> 47:21.593
Hello, son.

47:25.264 --> 47:27.933
They're letting you leave the apartment.

47:27.934 --> 47:31.803
Only to see my attorney.

47:31.870 --> 47:34.539
Lenny arranged it.

47:37.743 --> 47:41.246
I'm grateful that you came, Joe.

47:41.313 --> 47:47.151
I know you don't want anything to
do with me, but we need to talk.

47:47.152 --> 47:49.054
There's nothing to say.

47:49.121 --> 47:52.691
Lenny tells me that you
wanted to go to the press.

47:52.692 --> 47:57.764
You can't do that. You
are telling me what to do?

47:57.765 --> 48:01.967
I want you to take care of the family.

48:01.968 --> 48:03.436
The family?

48:03.437 --> 48:04.670
Jesus Christ.

48:04.671 --> 48:08.140
It's a little late to be worried
about us now, don't you think?

48:08.207 --> 48:11.375
I know you hate me for what I did.

48:11.443 --> 48:15.779
But I'm going to die in prison for it.

48:15.847 --> 48:22.019
And I need you to provide for
your mother and your sister.

48:22.086 --> 48:25.589
What the hell are you talking about?

48:25.657 --> 48:29.327
We've got money, Joe.

48:29.395 --> 48:32.531
What?

48:32.598 --> 48:36.602
We do.

48:36.670 --> 48:41.207
It's... out there.

49:30.088 --> 49:32.423
Yeah, hello.

49:32.490 --> 49:35.960
Who is this?

49:53.812 --> 49:57.947
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Ms. Hewes, but, um...

49:58.015 --> 50:00.150
Yes?

50:00.217 --> 50:03.553
What are you not telling us?

50:07.191 --> 50:11.528
This car accident is getting
a little more complicated.

50:11.596 --> 50:13.330
What do you mean?

50:13.331 --> 50:14.898
What's going on?

50:14.899 --> 50:19.269
Well, Ms. Hewes, we found a body.

50:26.644 --> 50:30.780
A body?

50:30.848 --> 50:33.382
Whose?

50:49.067 --> 50:51.669
A little left.

50:51.736 --> 50:53.404
Good.

50:53.405 --> 50:55.740
More.

50:58.210 --> 51:00.110
Perfect.
