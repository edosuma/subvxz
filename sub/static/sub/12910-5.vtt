00:46.283 --> 00:48.683
Pasquale?

00:51.683 --> 00:54.563
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

01:28.443 --> 01:33.243
It is for the company.

01:33.323 --> 01:37.763
- What is it?
- Just sign it. Relax.

01:37.843 --> 01:44.043
Write your initials on each page
and a signature at the end.

01:51.523 --> 01:55.283
Smile. I just transferred
EUR 20 million for you.

01:55.363 --> 02:00.283
- I'm taking Salba and saving you.
- Salba is worth 200 according to the contract.

02:00.363 --> 02:06.163
I get 10% and you go home with 90% to pennies.

02:06.243 --> 02:12.083
Without the pennies,
we would end up in court.

02:14.443 --> 02:17.843
But the main thing is profit.

02:17.923 --> 02:24.883
You still run things with this 10%.
Do we agree?

03:17.603 --> 03:20.923
You look great. You are tanned.

03:21.003 --> 03:27.643
I feel better.
Here there is no one to argue with.

03:28.723 --> 03:32.283
I have time to think.
How are you?

03:32.363 --> 03:37.283
Fine. Have you heard
Gennaro's got a girlfriend?

03:42.123 --> 03:44.483
Is she pretty?

03:44.563 --> 03:47.043
She's a good girl.

03:49.043 --> 03:51.843
Gennaro...

03:51.923 --> 03:56.283
The motorcycle that I gave you,
did you fix it?

03:57.323 --> 04:00.483
Does it run?

04:01.563 --> 04:06.443
It works, but after the accident
it's not like before.

04:06.523 --> 04:10.403
Change the filter.

04:10.483 --> 04:13.123
You'll see it will run well again.

04:33.963 --> 04:37.083
Hey.
Hey.

04:37.163 --> 04:39.923
- Were you sleeping?
- No.

04:41.123 --> 04:47.043
I am glad that you are awake
I have some good news.

04:47.123 --> 04:50.123
It is very good.

04:52.403 --> 04:56.483
- I bought a company.
- Have you?

04:56.563 --> 05:02.283
It is a large company that has just
won a big contract.

05:02.363 --> 05:06.123
It's called Salba, and I bought it for us.

05:06.203 --> 05:12.443
I was tired of making others rich,
and I will do anything for us.

05:14.603 --> 05:18.043
I did it also for the child's sake.

05:18.123 --> 05:20.963
It was so unexpected.

06:11.843 --> 06:15.363
Genny! Genny! Genny!

06:17.003 --> 06:19.683
Come on!

06:19.763 --> 06:25.123
That was the third.
Here, the fourth.

06:27.603 --> 06:30.843
Genny! Genny!

06:30.923 --> 06:34.683
That's enough.
I have things to do. See you.

06:34.763 --> 06:40.283
Can you not?
Shut up and suck my dick.

06:46.283 --> 06:49.603
Father was doing brilliantly.

06:50.603 --> 06:54.803
He may be in solitary, and still be on top.

06:54.883 --> 06:58.803
Father's punishment is being king
in that shithole place.

06:58.883 --> 07:01.883
But there are some things that 
are not going well.

07:01.963 --> 07:06.763
Business is bad. Do you know why?

07:06.843 --> 07:11.203
We don't sell Conte's dope anymore
and it's better.

07:11.283 --> 07:15.723
After the police took the cargo,
we sell this crap.

07:15.803 --> 07:19.763
The junkies will get their dope elsewhere.

07:19.843 --> 07:25.523
The money comes soon,
and we can get good dope again.

07:27.883 --> 07:30.443
Do you want to know the truth?

07:40.483 --> 07:43.643
There is no king-pin around.

07:43.723 --> 07:49.003
When the cat is away,
the mice will play.

07:50.363 --> 07:53.523
Your father must let someone else lead.

07:54.683 --> 07:59.123
You cannot lead from solitary confinement.

08:00.963 --> 08:04.843
Your turn, about time you take over.

08:04.923 --> 08:07.963
And if you lead...

08:09.163 --> 08:11.523
There are new rules of engagement.

08:11.603 --> 08:15.043
It's crazy to see it without anyone around.

08:15.123 --> 08:18.203
Perla, come here for a moment.

08:20.443 --> 08:27.123
There are also smaller rooms,
but I'd rather have it all.

08:27.203 --> 08:31.523
We can hire the DJ from Ibiza, the one you like.

08:31.603 --> 08:35.523
- Sven VÃ¤th-?
- 18th birthday is a milestone.

08:36.602 --> 08:40.803
"Can I have your attention,
there's been a change of plans"

08:40.883 --> 08:46.483
"Perla must waltz with her father."

08:47.523 --> 08:51.483
- I can't dance.
- I will lead you.

08:59.123 --> 09:01.283
Excuse me.

09:01.363 --> 09:03.923
Donna Imma.

09:05.003 --> 09:07.243
Yes.

09:07.323 --> 09:10.243
Of course, whenever you want.

09:12.323 --> 09:16.083
Fine. It's good.

09:19.003 --> 09:21.843
All due respect.

09:39.163 --> 09:42.963
- What's up?
- We need cash.

09:43.043 --> 09:46.243
This is easily arranged. How much?

09:46.323 --> 09:51.763
Everything Ciro and I gave you
which turned into bonds somewhere.

09:51.843 --> 09:55.043
In Finland. Do you have them?

09:55.123 --> 09:58.243
I said we would need them.

09:58.323 --> 10:02.443
- Is that a problem?
No, not at all.

10:02.523 --> 10:08.523
But the Finnish bonds offer
good return, it would be a shame.

10:09.603 --> 10:11.763
I can take the ones from Panama.

10:11.843 --> 10:15.963
They were administered 
by Pasquale De Vivo.

10:16.043 --> 10:20.043
I don't think it is a good investment.

10:20.123 --> 10:26.843
Trust me. It may take some time
but it's probably for the best.

10:26.923 --> 10:32.083
You said they were liquid cash.
They were AAA and from Finland.

10:35.043 --> 10:39.843
Wait Gennaro. I think
there has been a misunderstanding.

10:39.923 --> 10:43.083
My husband says we need money.

10:43.163 --> 10:49.563
I don't think Don Pietro is fully
aware of market developments.

10:49.643 --> 10:52.363
My husband decides.

10:52.443 --> 10:57.243
If my husband wants it, my husband gets it.

11:03.043 --> 11:05.723
I do not trust him.

11:05.803 --> 11:11.803
He thinks he can do as he pleases while your father is 
in prison and it's not right, the money is ours.

11:13.963 --> 11:18.723
You can not manage from isolation.
Father needs to hand over the reins.

11:18.803 --> 11:22.483
- Says who?
- Ciro says so.

11:25.403 --> 11:29.883
Ciro should mind his own business.
He's not family.

11:29.963 --> 11:33.883
I cannot release the Finnish bonds.
These are new times.

11:33.963 --> 11:36.283
You should be able to do anything.

11:36.363 --> 11:39.803
Credit Authorization can mess things up.

11:39.883 --> 11:42.283
There are strict rules for all.

11:42.363 --> 11:45.883
After all the interest and commissions
I have earned for you.

11:45.963 --> 11:50.723
Musi, you are an important customer for us.

11:50.803 --> 11:54.683
You must ask for new security
if you sell the bonds.

11:54.763 --> 11:58.643
I just bought Salba, who won a big contract.

11:58.723 --> 12:03.483
- Take it as collateral.
- It doesn't work with Salba.

12:03.563 --> 12:05.963
Assets are most intangible.

12:06.043 --> 12:11.163
Should I transfer the
contract, if you don't pay?

12:21.243 --> 12:25.083
How nice. Is it a shell?

12:25.163 --> 12:28.483
- Open it.
- Help me.

12:33.123 --> 12:36.763
This isn't zirconia. It's real diamonds.

12:36.843 --> 12:41.603
Really? Like yours?
Do we have the same now?

12:41.683 --> 12:44.243
Thank you.

12:44.323 --> 12:48.203
- Do you like them?
- Of course I do.

12:48.283 --> 12:51.123
You are so sweet.

12:59.603 --> 13:01.683
Mother.

13:04.203 --> 13:07.763
- Mother.
- The money is yet to arrive.

13:07.843 --> 13:10.643
- What do we do?
- We're leaving.

13:10.723 --> 13:13.603
Are we going to Milan?

13:15.803 --> 13:18.683
- When?
- Tomorrow.

13:23.123 --> 13:25.563
We can just call.

13:25.643 --> 13:28.483
You know you can not call.

13:28.563 --> 13:31.523
Okay, so off we go.

13:32.563 --> 13:36.363
Are you with her, then?

13:36.443 --> 13:39.723
Her name is Noemi.

14:02.603 --> 14:06.083
What is it?

14:06.163 --> 14:09.163
A love nest. Like it?

14:09.243 --> 14:13.443
- Come on.
- Let me go, Gennaro.

14:20.643 --> 14:24.643
When I come back, I want to find you here.

14:27.363 --> 14:30.243
When are you coming back?

14:32.043 --> 14:35.243
- When are you coming back?
- Soon.

14:38.243 --> 14:41.403
Soon when?

14:42.803 --> 14:45.483
- What?
- Very soon.

14:52.643 --> 14:55.843
I does not matter very soon.

14:55.923 --> 14:59.163
What are you saying?

14:59.243 --> 15:03.923
I want a man.
Not one who obeys his mother.

15:08.843 --> 15:11.643
A man?

15:12.963 --> 15:16.923
I don't obey anyone.

15:18.763 --> 15:21.003
Yes?

15:45.763 --> 15:48.603
You are mine now.

16:27.523 --> 16:30.083
- Donna Imma.
- Hello.

16:30.163 --> 16:34.283
We called the office,
and they said you were sick.

16:34.363 --> 16:37.803
Yes, I haven't been feeling well.

16:39.563 --> 16:42.323
Go ahead, sit down.

16:45.323 --> 16:48.443
- Franco.
- Genny.

16:48.523 --> 16:52.043
- Everything good?
- Sort of.

16:52.123 --> 16:55.203
Shall we go into the living room?

16:57.803 --> 17:01.363
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thank you.

17:02.523 --> 17:06.883
It is normal that it takes a little time.

17:06.963 --> 17:09.963
It's a large amount.

17:10.042 --> 17:14.002
Of course. But we would like to
understand the situation.

17:14.083 --> 17:17.363
Yes, of course.

17:17.443 --> 17:20.443
Hello, Franco. Good day.

17:23.762 --> 17:26.803
I go into the next room.

17:30.003 --> 17:34.523
- It's my daughter.
- Do you have a daughter?

17:34.603 --> 17:38.963
She's my wife's daughter
but she is like my own.

17:39.043 --> 17:42.843
She is beautiful, she really is pretty.

17:44.923 --> 17:49.963
-  What were we talking about?
- We come into your office tomorrow.

17:51.243 --> 17:54.043
We will familiarize ourselves with it all.

17:54.123 --> 17:57.723
Yes, that's fine. Perfect.

18:19.243 --> 18:22.243
Here you go. Here is the office.

18:24.403 --> 18:26.843
Good day. Welcome.

18:26.923 --> 18:30.923
Here's the investment list first for real estate.

18:31.003 --> 18:34.963
- Is it also in paper form?
- Yes.

18:35.043 --> 18:39.083
- So give me the papers.
- Yes, as you will.

18:39.163 --> 18:43.283
Here, then, a list of the properties.

18:43.363 --> 18:47.683
I can compare it
with the company's purchase contract.

18:47.763 --> 18:49.483
Good.

18:49.563 --> 18:55.643
On the basis of supply and market
estimated appreciation to...

18:55.723 --> 18:58.963
Can I see?

19:00.203 --> 19:04.283
I mean, I can assess
the estimated appreciation.

19:04.363 --> 19:09.323
- What does it mean?
It's the return on investment.

19:10.483 --> 19:13.843
- Fuck.
- I am in the next room.

19:18.763 --> 19:21.443
- You want some coffee?
- No, thank you.

19:21.523 --> 19:23.163
No.

19:23.243 --> 19:26.603
I'll see you later.

19:26.683 --> 19:29.283
Happy reading.

19:47.003 --> 19:50.323
Federico? Hey, it's Franco.

19:51.323 --> 19:55.963
Good. You?
I have a suggestion. Can we meet?

19:58.483 --> 20:02.163
Fine. Then I come over. Hey.

20:03.243 --> 20:05.403
Let me understand something.

20:05.483 --> 20:08.963
You just bought it and you say it's
worth twice as much.

20:09.043 --> 20:13.563
And you sell it for the price
you paid. Do I look like an idiot?

20:13.643 --> 20:16.283
You are right.

20:16.363 --> 20:21.043
I need cash.
I want to buy something else.

20:21.123 --> 20:24.403
- Did you say 20?
- Yes, 20.

20:24.483 --> 20:27.483
- Quick.
- I have to think about it.

20:27.563 --> 20:32.723
There's no time. It has to be now,
I give up my profits.

20:33.843 --> 20:38.043
If the offer is good you take it now, 
otherwise I'll ask Marchisio.

20:41.883 --> 20:47.803
I need to check the numbers.
If they vote, we can act.

21:12.603 --> 21:15.083
What are we doing here, mom?

21:15.163 --> 21:18.243
Can you see the red buildings?

21:19.283 --> 21:21.643
They are ours.

21:21.723 --> 21:25.123
- Both of them?
- Yes.

21:35.243 --> 21:38.443
Gennaro. Look over there.

21:40.243 --> 21:43.523
- It's all ours.
- What?

21:43.603 --> 21:48.843
Yes, and you know who, who made it?

21:48.923 --> 21:52.283
Your father. He did all of this.

21:52.363 --> 21:56.523
That is why we must take care of it.
Do you understand?

21:56.603 --> 22:00.923
- I need to buy a gift.
- Do you understand nothing?

22:01.003 --> 22:06.003
I need to buy a gift for Noemi.
The buildings won't go anywhere.

22:06.083 --> 22:08.723
See you later.

22:17.523 --> 22:23.163
The capital structure should have
better financial instruments.

22:24.203 --> 22:30.363
Real estate generates no income,
but money makes money.

22:31.563 --> 22:36.163
I can make money without spending a cent

22:36.243 --> 22:39.363
Taking and giving loans.
Currency trading.

22:39.443 --> 22:46.003
And above all I can do it without risk.

22:46.523 --> 22:50.323
- Why?
- If a lawyer gets a tip...

22:50.403 --> 22:55.563
He can track real estate but not money.

22:55.643 --> 23:02.283
I can move money
around the globe in an hour.

23:02.363 --> 23:08.243
How long do you think it can take
for a lawyer to track money?

23:08.323 --> 23:11.283
With the law we have today, ten years.

23:13.163 --> 23:16.003
Excuse me.

23:18.483 --> 23:24.563
I can get money to appear
or disappear as I want.

23:28.043 --> 23:32.203
But that is exactly what I don't like.

23:32.283 --> 23:36.763
The real estate and the houses are standing.

23:36.843 --> 23:42.683
But the money we make appear or vanish.

23:42.763 --> 23:45.683
Be honest.

23:45.763 --> 23:51.683
What happened to the Finnish
bonds? We need them.

23:51.763 --> 23:55.803
It takes a few days to release them.

23:55.883 --> 24:00.803
We can look at the release papers together.
Yes, let's do that.

24:00.883 --> 24:04.403
Because I don't like magicians.

24:04.483 --> 24:10.163
- Answer it will you. It may be important.
- No, you're more important Donna Imma.

24:14.603 --> 24:18.403
- What's going on?
-  There's an irregularity.

24:18.483 --> 24:22.443
A detail in the sustainability index.

24:22.523 --> 24:28.163
- A detail? How could this happen?
- It was a slip.

24:28.243 --> 24:33.723
- Salba is worthless without that contract detail.
- We'll ask the auditor.

24:33.803 --> 24:39.043
- What's his name?
- Sivieri. Luigi Sivieri.

24:39.123 --> 24:41.243
Idiot!

24:52.163 --> 24:55.283
- Master.
- Fuck you.

24:55.363 --> 25:00.003
- Do you fuckup the contract?
- I'll fix it.

25:00.083 --> 25:03.003
Now it's your problem.

25:18.283 --> 25:23.003
- You're late.
- I got no notice.

25:23.083 --> 25:26.723
I have created a miracle.

25:39.843 --> 25:42.283
Accountant Sivieri?

25:42.363 --> 25:45.083
- Have we met?
- No.

25:45.163 --> 25:48.843
But we are both interested in Salba.

25:48.923 --> 25:53.963
- Who are you?
- Someone who will open up the bidding.

25:54.043 --> 25:57.763
Excuse me.

25:57.843 --> 26:02.483
If you adjust the audit
you will be well rewarded.

26:02.563 --> 26:07.843
- You got the wrong guy.
- You will get 100,000 euros.

26:17.563 --> 26:20.763
- Listen.
- Get off me.

26:20.843 --> 26:25.683
You get more when it's done.

26:25.763 --> 26:29.923
Think about it.
I'll call this afternoon.

26:49.563 --> 26:54.043
Mom, I could not stay in Milan.

26:55.203 --> 27:00.923
- You get the gift?
- Yes.

27:01.723 --> 27:06.323
- Do you like it?
- It's nice, it's nice.

27:06.403 --> 27:09.363
Do not worry, Mom.

27:20.923 --> 27:23.883
Hey, Ciro.

27:28.523 --> 27:30.643
It's done.

27:30.723 --> 27:34.083
The money is coming.

27:37.163 --> 27:40.723
Genna, I've thought about it.

27:40.803 --> 27:46.883
We should manage the money.
I do not trust Baroncino.

27:46.963 --> 27:52.043
He says he buys dope
for 20 euros, but it's not true.

27:52.123 --> 27:58.283
He pays half, and we get
garbage. Therefore, we sell poorly.

27:58.363 --> 28:02.523
But he has always stood for it.

28:02.603 --> 28:08.003
Who do you trust? Who?

28:08.083 --> 28:11.923
- Him or me?
- You.

28:12.003 --> 28:17.803
Let me handle money matters.
Relax.

28:17.883 --> 28:22.403
Genna. This is our moment.
Do you understand?

28:22.483 --> 28:27.923
We need to change everything, you and me.
We will turn the whole place upside down.

28:28.003 --> 28:31.083
Up and down.

28:33.723 --> 28:37.083
Do you want a cigarette?

28:41.723 --> 28:44.763
Give me a kiss.

28:58.283 --> 29:03.363
Accountant Sivieri, it's me.
What do you think?

29:04.323 --> 29:08.323
Hello? Hello?

29:26.403 --> 29:30.963
- I was getting Noemi's gift.
- When did you get back?

29:31.043 --> 29:34.283
Genna...

29:34.363 --> 29:38.883
Do you understand that father is inside?
It's just the two of us now.

29:38.963 --> 29:45.163
- Don't worry, I know what needs to be done.
- How?

29:45.243 --> 29:50.203
When the money comes,
We must rid ourselves of Baroncino.

29:50.283 --> 29:56.443
What do you mean?
- His shit products sell poorly and our territories are going bad.

29:56.523 --> 30:01.323
Is this something you've figured out
or is it Ciro again?

30:01.403 --> 30:04.203
- No.
- No?

30:04.283 --> 30:07.643
I figured it out myself.

30:28.203 --> 30:34.283
You do not know who you are dealing with.
You can not say no.

30:34.363 --> 30:39.883
- For your own, your family's
and your three children's sake.

30:39.963 --> 30:46.163
Take this money and do it,
you must. And do it quickly.

31:09.803 --> 31:12.843
- Hello.
- Signora.

31:12.923 --> 31:16.203
Good day. We're looking for Franco Musi.

31:16.283 --> 31:21.403
- Who is it?
- Musi? We have a warrant for you arrest.

31:34.083 --> 31:41.043
See what that fucking idiot has done!

31:42.843 --> 31:46.603
First he stole our money.

31:46.683 --> 31:50.043
Then he put on that show to try
and get it back.

31:50.123 --> 31:54.043
And now he's been arrested.

31:54.123 --> 31:58.603
- The big idiot piece of shit.
- What happens now?

31:58.683 --> 32:03.603
Yes, what do you think?
What do you think happens?

32:03.683 --> 32:08.083
I want him out of jail.
I sent our lawyer.

32:08.163 --> 32:13.163
I want him out,
before that asshole sticks us all together.

32:13.243 --> 32:19.163
So he finally succeeded
for him to destroy it all.

32:23.483 --> 32:29.043
Tell them I'll take care of it.
If anything happens to me I can't help.

32:29.123 --> 32:35.163
Take it easy, Musi.
It will be all right all along.

32:35.243 --> 32:40.963
I have applied for release.
It will probably be granted.

32:41.043 --> 32:45.803
- Thank you. When?
- Take couple days.

32:45.883 --> 32:50.723
You just take it easy.

33:10.683 --> 33:15.803
He will not say anything, and when he's
at home, he can not be broken.

33:15.883 --> 33:22.443
The problem is the 100,000. It caused
suspicion of money laundering.

33:22.523 --> 33:27.723
The prosecutor sent a letter of request
to Switzerland, but this takes time.

33:28.883 --> 33:33.163
- But the Swiss have found something.
- What?

33:34.403 --> 33:41.283
- Public Trustee's accounts.
- That idiot. That's our money.

33:41.363 --> 33:44.483
- Do you know if the money has been seized yet?
- Not yet.

33:44.563 --> 33:48.563
But when they close in with more scrutiny
with the letter of request-

33:48.643 --> 33:52.883
-Confiscate all accounts.

33:53.923 --> 34:00.723
Donna Imma, I don't know how much
they'll find if they start looking.

34:02.203 --> 34:04.923
What should we do?

34:05.003 --> 34:11.402
Everything that they have found so far,
we have to make disappear.

34:17.563 --> 34:22.083
- How?
- Frankly speaking...

34:22.163 --> 34:29.443
I'm a technician. I come up with
technical and theoretical solutions.

34:29.523 --> 34:35.803
- I am not a counsellor. Do you understand?
- Yes.

34:48.563 --> 34:52.803
Why, donna Imma?

34:53.483 --> 34:57.323
Why do you say that?

34:57.403 --> 35:00.803
- I can promise you that...
- Mr.

35:00.883 --> 35:06.603
You can not promise me anything.
And we can not take the risk.

35:08.563 --> 35:14.323
I know I fucked up.
But I can make amends.

35:14.403 --> 35:18.563
All accounts transferred to your wife,
and you open them up.

35:18.643 --> 35:24.563
Then we can get our money,
before the state confiscates them.

35:25.763 --> 35:29.283
Do not cry.

35:29.363 --> 35:32.963
Think of the child who is coming.

35:34.203 --> 35:38.563
And your daughter. I've seen her.

35:39.363 --> 35:42.443
- You really love her.
- Yes.

35:42.523 --> 35:45.403
You can see that.

35:45.763 --> 35:50.403
You have to do it for their sake.

35:50.483 --> 35:54.283
Then they can be comfortable.

35:55.363 --> 36:00.163
Trust me.
It is the only solution.

36:00.683 --> 36:05.883
I give you my word.
They'll never go without anything.

36:06.403 --> 36:09.323
Never.

36:10.283 --> 36:12.923
Never.

37:05.163 --> 37:08.043
- Perla.
- Hey, Franco.

37:08.123 --> 37:10.443
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

37:10.523 --> 37:14.163
Can I talk to you? Sorry.

37:16.883 --> 37:20.003
- Has something happened?
- No.

37:20.083 --> 37:23.403
- No, it's a small issue.
- Sure?

37:23.483 --> 37:26.763
- Yes, excuse me.
- Can we get the cake?

37:26.843 --> 37:32.003
- Yeah, I'll get it.
- I'll turn off the light.

39:52.803 --> 39:54.803
Mother.

39:57.523 --> 40:01.683
- You look tired.
- Yes, a little.

40:01.763 --> 40:05.723
- Now you can rest.
- No.

40:05.803 --> 40:09.043
I have to visit your father.

40:10.043 --> 40:13.483
Are you coming with me?

40:14.643 --> 40:18.283
- Can I talk to him?
- No.

40:18.363 --> 40:21.643
It was the first time

40:21.723 --> 40:24.963
But now there is only one person in at a time.

40:25.043 --> 40:31.363
Okay, take off.
He would probably rather see you. See you.

40:32.323 --> 40:34.763
See you...

40:35.003 --> 40:39.003
Why can't you go see him?

40:39.083 --> 40:44.363
It's you who must see him.
Do not let your mom take over.

40:44.443 --> 40:50.923
You should talk to your father, not her.
It's you who decides.

40:52.203 --> 40:56.843
- Is it me who decides?
- Yes.

40:56.923 --> 41:00.403
Yes, it is me who decides.

41:00.483 --> 41:05.363
Why then do you dictate all the time,
where to go, what to do?

41:05.443 --> 41:08.843
Genny, do this. Genny, do that.

41:08.923 --> 41:13.443
I'm damn tired of it.
Do you understand that?

41:13.523 --> 41:16.123
I decide.

41:16.203 --> 41:21.043
And I decide
that you must take my mother to prison.

41:21.123 --> 41:24.283
Go.

41:28.003 --> 41:30.883
Genny can light it.

41:30.963 --> 41:34.843
- Can't you swim?
- Now we light it.

41:34.923 --> 41:37.883
You can even go for a swim.

42:04.483 --> 42:08.043
Gennaro is a good man.

42:08.123 --> 42:11.883
It is clear.
But he is still growing.

42:13.643 --> 42:17.443
He'll be a great boss.

42:17.523 --> 42:20.403
Like his father.

42:25.243 --> 42:29.843
I have taken care of it all.
Do not worry.

42:30.483 --> 42:35.443
I talked to the lawyer,
so I know everything.

42:40.803 --> 42:45.083
Imma, I'm tired.

42:45.923 --> 42:49.403
Perhaps it is time to retreat.

42:51.403 --> 42:55.203
Is Genny still with the girl?

42:59.763 --> 43:04.803
He's good.
Has been a real man, my son.

43:04.883 --> 43:10.923
Your son still can't find a good woman.

43:11.003 --> 43:17.083
She is not right for him.
A mother knows certain things.

43:17.163 --> 43:21.563
- I know.
- Imma... He decides.

43:25.483 --> 43:32.043
And he can always ask Ciro.
Ciro is an expert on women.

43:32.123 --> 43:35.203
Do you understand?

43:39.563 --> 43:43.083
Do you understand?

43:46.163 --> 43:48.563
Good.

43:48.643 --> 43:52.283
Then I can relax.

44:44.043 --> 44:49.723
I found him well, thinking clearly
and he knows what he wants.

44:52.563 --> 44:56.563
He also said what you have to do.

44:56.643 --> 45:01.683
- You're going to Spain.
- To Spain?

45:01.763 --> 45:05.483
Yes. You need to make peace with Conte.

45:05.563 --> 45:10.243
We must sell his goods again.

45:19.923 --> 45:23.083
Then it's done.
