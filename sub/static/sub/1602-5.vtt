(Norma Louise) When Annika
died, she gave me something.

00:06.338 --> 00:07.839
(Dylan) What's on it?

00:07.840 --> 00:09.674
(Norma Louise) I don't know. It's locked.

00:09.675 --> 00:11.409
(Dylan) Some guy was
just searching the office.

00:11.410 --> 00:12.543
He said that we had
something that wasn't ours.

00:12.544 --> 00:14.278
(Norma Louise) What?

00:14.279 --> 00:15.679
I'll hide it at the farm,
then we can figure out

00:15.680 --> 00:16.747
what to do together,
but it can't stay here.

00:16.748 --> 00:19.282
- Tell me to leave!
- Caleb!

00:19.283 --> 00:21.218
Is it really like she said it was?

00:21.219 --> 00:23.954
Yeah, I just want to tell her I'm sorry.

00:23.955 --> 00:26.523
(Norman) What the hell
is going on here, Dylan?

00:26.524 --> 00:28.258
Does mom know he's here?

00:28.259 --> 00:30.227
Look, we don't want any trouble.

00:30.228 --> 00:31.599
Norman!

00:32.948 --> 00:34.831
You can't tell her, you understand me?

00:34.832 --> 00:36.498
He raped her!

00:36.499 --> 00:39.368
Everything I've built with
mom... It'll all be destroyed.

00:39.369 --> 00:40.737
You betrayed mother.

00:40.738 --> 00:42.605
And she needs to know.

00:42.606 --> 00:44.707
Norman, please!

03:33.867 --> 03:35.567
Are you crazy?

03:35.568 --> 03:38.200
You drove me off the road.
I could've been killed.

03:39.380 --> 03:41.406
You're lucky you're not dead, Norma Bates.

03:49.848 --> 03:51.649
I'm calling 911.

03:51.650 --> 03:53.684
Sure, you could.

03:53.685 --> 03:56.486
But do you know who would
be better for you to call?

03:56.487 --> 03:57.821
Bob Paris.

03:57.822 --> 03:59.823
He'd like to speak with you.

03:59.824 --> 04:02.459
You have something that belongs to him.

04:04.362 --> 04:06.297
I don't know what you're talking about.

04:06.924 --> 04:09.900
Seriously. Do you think we're idiots?

04:11.720 --> 04:13.820
I don't know who you are.
I'm calling Sheriff Romero.

04:13.821 --> 04:15.722
He can't save you.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.624
Can't even save himself.

04:17.625 --> 04:21.528
Do yourself a favor: Call Mr. Paris.

04:21.529 --> 04:23.930
You can reach him at the Arcanum Club.

04:30.537 --> 04:32.037
And do it soon.

I'm not clamming, Stanley.

05:15.880 --> 05:18.915
The girl they found in
the reeds over there?

05:18.916 --> 05:21.450
Well, you know the tides.

05:21.451 --> 05:24.119
Where do you think she might have
been thrown in to end up here?

05:24.120 --> 05:25.821
Well, this time of year,

05:25.822 --> 05:27.690
could be anywhere within a mile or so.

05:27.691 --> 05:29.692

You didn't see anything unusual, did you?

05:47.577 --> 05:48.710
Okay.

05:48.711 --> 05:51.045
Good talking to you, Stanley.

05:51.046 --> 05:53.114
You know, a funny thing...

05:53.115 --> 05:56.049
about five days ago

05:56.050 --> 05:59.553
I came across a DuFont kid
down here in the channel.

05:59.554 --> 06:03.557
He was rowing a skiff.
Said he was bird watching.

06:03.558 --> 06:06.560
He didn't have a camera...

06:06.561 --> 06:08.395
or binoculars.

06:08.396 --> 06:09.630
And it was raining.

06:11.799 --> 06:14.334
And I didn't think much
about it until the next day

06:14.335 --> 06:16.869
when I read in the paper about the girl.

06:16.870 --> 06:19.405
You're talking about Clay DuFont, right?

06:20.807 --> 06:23.042
Yeah.

06:23.043 --> 06:25.578
Why didn't you say anything
to anyone about this?

06:27.681 --> 06:29.348
Nobody asked.

06:34.687 --> 06:36.455
Thanks, Stanley.

06:40.660 --> 06:42.661
[chair creaking]

07:01.747 --> 07:04.046
Your mom asked me to stay with you.

07:09.520 --> 07:13.590
- Was she upset?
- Yeah, I think so, but...

07:13.591 --> 07:15.592
don't worry about anything.

07:17.928 --> 07:19.929
You want some breakfast?

07:23.366 --> 07:25.534
Something terrible has happened.

07:28.538 --> 07:30.639
I found out that Norma's brother

07:30.640 --> 07:33.575
has been staying up at Dylan's farm.

07:33.576 --> 07:36.612
I had to tell mother.

07:36.613 --> 07:38.879
Did you have to?

07:38.880 --> 07:40.648
He raped her.

07:40.649 --> 07:41.982
He's dangerous.

07:41.983 --> 07:44.852
I don't understand how Dylan
could have anything to do with him.

07:44.853 --> 07:46.387
Because it's his father.

07:46.388 --> 07:48.055
And we all whitewash our parents' sins,

07:48.056 --> 07:50.458
because on some, some level...

07:52.628 --> 07:54.461
Because we need to.

[door opens]

08:08.976 --> 08:10.544
No, it's me.

08:15.549 --> 08:18.451
I'm so sorry, Dylan.

08:18.452 --> 08:20.453
I had to tell her.

08:22.389 --> 08:24.390
I had to.

08:29.762 --> 08:32.764
[cell phone ringing]

08:36.001 --> 08:37.402
Yeah?

08:37.403 --> 08:39.070
(woman) Hi, is this Dylan Massett?

08:39.071 --> 08:40.804
Yeah.

08:40.806 --> 08:42.874
(woman) I'm calling from
St. Sebastian Hospital.

08:42.875 --> 08:44.809
We have your mother, Norma
Bates, here in the ER.

08:44.810 --> 08:46.577
She was in an accident.

08:51.583 --> 08:53.490
I'm looking for my mom, Norma Bates.

08:53.491 --> 08:56.987
Dylan, I'm here.

08:56.988 --> 08:59.857
We have to get out of here.
I have to tell you something.

08:59.858 --> 09:01.859
Norma...

09:01.860 --> 09:05.773
- I'm so sorry.
- About what?

09:07.364 --> 09:08.865
Ab... About everything.

09:08.866 --> 09:10.700
Well,

09:10.701 --> 09:13.870
it's not like you're the
one who ran me off the road.

09:13.871 --> 09:16.572
Wait, wait... Someone ran you off the road?

09:16.573 --> 09:18.408
Yes, and threatened me.

09:18.409 --> 09:21.410
Some guy who told me to
contact some other guy

09:21.411 --> 09:22.977
because I had something of his.

09:22.978 --> 09:24.679
What's wrong with these criminals

09:24.680 --> 09:26.681
that they can't just
hang on to their own shit?

09:26.682 --> 09:27.849
Like it's my fault!

09:27.850 --> 09:29.317
Who did he tell you to contact?

09:29.318 --> 09:30.685
Bob Paris.

09:30.686 --> 09:31.920
I've heard Romero say his name too.

09:31.921 --> 09:33.422
Who is he?

09:33.423 --> 09:36.624
I've heard his name around the drug
trade. I think he's a money guy.

09:36.625 --> 09:38.719
Look, we need to get that
flash drive to Romero.

09:38.720 --> 09:39.820
- No.
- No?

09:39.821 --> 09:41.822
No. Dylan, we're in trouble.

09:41.823 --> 09:43.924
The motel is probably going to go
under. I have no financial backup.

09:43.925 --> 09:45.258
Norman is getting worse.

09:45.259 --> 09:46.760
He had another blackout this morning.

09:46.761 --> 09:48.028
I found him in the kitchen
mumbling to himself.

09:48.029 --> 09:49.596
I couldn't wake him up.

09:49.597 --> 09:50.864
I'm scared, Dylan. I don't know what to do.

09:50.865 --> 09:52.032
I don't... I don't know how to care...

09:52.033 --> 09:53.966
Take care of him without any money.

09:53.967 --> 09:55.534
Norma...

09:55.535 --> 09:57.269
I know that flash drive
is incredibly valuable.

09:57.270 --> 09:58.638
That dying girl gave it to me,

09:58.639 --> 09:59.939
as if she knew that I needed help.

09:59.940 --> 10:01.807
She gave it to me... It's like an omen.

10:01.808 --> 10:03.976
I won't give it up. I'm
not gonna give it up.

10:03.977 --> 10:07.212
Please, Dylan. Please.

10:16.440 --> 10:18.308
(Bob) Hold on a second. Here he is.

10:22.227 --> 10:24.695
Always the drama with you.

10:24.696 --> 10:25.996
- You want to join us?
- Sure.

10:25.997 --> 10:28.065
Have you met Marcus Young, Alex?

10:28.066 --> 10:29.599
He's the one running against you.

10:29.600 --> 10:31.669
Yeah, we've met. Now he can leave.

10:35.707 --> 10:37.207
You're the sheriff.

10:37.208 --> 10:40.277
Thanks for lunch, Bob. We'll be in touch.

10:40.278 --> 10:42.545
How about a smile, Sheriff?

10:42.546 --> 10:43.813
Relax.

10:43.814 --> 10:45.815
You're always so tense, man.

10:45.816 --> 10:47.684
It's not good for your heart.

10:47.685 --> 10:49.552
Or your head.

10:55.092 --> 10:57.193
So Clay DuFont got rid of the body for you.

10:57.194 --> 10:58.727
That's a big accusation, Alex.

10:58.728 --> 11:00.228
You want some dessert?

11:00.229 --> 11:01.863
Will you calm the hell down?

11:01.864 --> 11:03.699
I'm surprised you haven't had a stroke yet.

11:03.700 --> 11:06.802
Wh... Why was Lindsay
Davis blackmailing you, Bob?

11:06.803 --> 11:08.603
Whatever she had on you,

11:08.604 --> 11:10.806
she passed to Annika,
and now they're both dead

11:10.807 --> 11:12.240
and it's disappeared.

11:12.241 --> 11:14.242
And?

11:14.243 --> 11:16.643
So what's gone missing,
Bob? What are we lookinfor?

11:16.644 --> 11:19.246
Flash drive. A simple silver flash drive.

11:19.247 --> 11:21.615
It's my property, and I want it back.

11:21.616 --> 11:25.186
- What the hell is on it?
- Confidential information.

11:25.187 --> 11:27.221
Worth the lives of two women?

11:27.222 --> 11:29.056
You're asking me?

11:29.057 --> 11:31.759
You've killed people
for the good of this town

11:31.760 --> 11:33.626
and we've both slept better for it.

11:33.627 --> 11:35.795
You're telling me that two
women are lying in the morgue

11:35.796 --> 11:37.663
'cause the town's welfare depended on it?

11:37.664 --> 11:39.532
I'm going to talk to you
like a person now, Alex.

11:39.533 --> 11:41.234
Like somebody I grew up
with, played ball with,

11:41.235 --> 11:43.669
I felt sorry for because their
home life was so crappy, okay?

11:43.670 --> 11:47.673
You are in a hole here. A deep hole.

11:47.674 --> 11:49.775
You want to do what's in the
best interest of the town,

11:49.776 --> 11:51.043
find the damn flash drive

11:51.044 --> 11:53.145
and quit making this about everything else.

11:53.146 --> 11:55.147
I didn't particularly
want to bring Marcus Young

11:55.148 --> 11:56.248
out here to take your job.

11:56.249 --> 11:57.883
You left me with no choice.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.952
You left none of us with any choice.

12:02.488 --> 12:05.023
You know what, Bob? I
feel exactly the same way.

12:05.024 --> 12:08.092
And you're forcing me into a corner,

12:08.093 --> 12:10.527
and there's not gonna be room
in that corner for both of us.

12:10.528 --> 12:12.696
No, there's not.

12:12.697 --> 12:15.199
And the only way I see
out of this for both of us

12:15.200 --> 12:18.636
is for you to go to Norma Bates
and get back the flash drive.

12:21.840 --> 12:23.840
Yeah, I'm pretty sure she has it.

12:27.879 --> 12:29.545
You know her, right?

12:37.789 --> 12:39.289
(Emma) So here's an extra towel,

12:39.290 --> 12:40.990
some toiletries, and, yeah,

12:40.991 --> 12:42.825
I'll be in the office if you need anything.

12:42.826 --> 12:45.828
Oh, and the password for the
WiFi is "MOTHER," all caps.

12:45.829 --> 12:48.831
[seagulls squawking]

12:56.873 --> 12:58.673
She doesn't know anything about Caleb.

12:58.674 --> 13:00.108
You didn't say anything to her.

13:00.109 --> 13:01.676
What are you doing, man?

13:01.677 --> 13:03.945
No, I did tell her. I
told her this morning.

13:03.946 --> 13:05.646
Stop it, Norman!

13:05.647 --> 13:07.581
Dylan, I swear.

13:07.582 --> 13:09.650
I don't know why she pretended
like she doesn't know.

13:09.651 --> 13:11.052
Then either she's insane or you are.

13:13.522 --> 13:15.588
He feels bad, Norman.

13:15.589 --> 13:16.957
All he wants is to talk to her,

13:16.958 --> 13:18.725
to tell her how much he regrets it.

13:18.726 --> 13:20.928
He's not a monster.

13:20.929 --> 13:23.063
And you don't have to say anything to her.

13:23.064 --> 13:25.699
I've made a decision.
I'm gonna tell her myself.

13:25.700 --> 13:27.600
Soon.

13:27.601 --> 13:29.102
Just stay out of it.

14:24.255 --> 14:26.890
You look hungry.

14:26.891 --> 14:29.959
- Me?
- Yeah.

14:29.960 --> 14:31.261
Come here a second.

14:35.025 --> 14:37.126
My car had to get towed.
I'm just waiting for the bus.

14:37.127 --> 14:39.995
Does that mean you're not hungry?

14:39.996 --> 14:41.196
[laughs]

14:41.197 --> 14:42.464
You know, I probably am.

14:42.465 --> 14:44.232
I haven't eaten since this morning.

14:44.233 --> 14:47.035
But I need to catch the bus.
I live, like, 20 minutes away.

14:47.036 --> 14:48.970
Come on. I'll give you a lift.

14:48.971 --> 14:51.839
I'm going right near where you live.

14:51.840 --> 14:54.142
Where do you live?

14:54.143 --> 14:56.178
[laughs]

14:56.179 --> 14:57.944
I, uh...

14:57.945 --> 14:59.513
No, I don't want to put you out.

14:59.514 --> 15:02.015
I'm a community college teacher

15:02.016 --> 15:04.518
who teaches three
50-minute classes a week.

15:04.519 --> 15:05.919
You're not putting me out.

15:08.923 --> 15:11.024
[axe hitting wood]

15:11.025 --> 15:13.026
[grunting]

15:32.378 --> 15:33.512
[yells]

15:36.282 --> 15:39.451
[sobbing]

15:39.452 --> 15:42.321
I wanted to ask for a cup of sugar,

15:42.322 --> 15:44.523
but you said that was off-limit.

15:44.524 --> 15:46.191
Get the hell out of here.

15:48.227 --> 15:50.027
Look, don't you point that thing at me

15:50.028 --> 15:51.995
unless you plan on using it.

15:58.870 --> 16:00.971
Okay.

16:00.972 --> 16:03.841
(Chick) Something bad happened to you.

16:03.842 --> 16:07.244
Want to hug it out?

16:07.245 --> 16:09.446
Go to hell.

16:09.447 --> 16:12.782
Yeah, yeah, I get that.

16:12.783 --> 16:15.418
I totally get that.

16:17.355 --> 16:20.757
Hey, you like boar jerky?

16:20.758 --> 16:23.825
You've never had jerky
until you've had boar jerky.

16:23.826 --> 16:25.026
No.

16:25.027 --> 16:26.194
I got too many rabbits here.

16:26.195 --> 16:27.329
You need one of those?

16:27.330 --> 16:28.897
No, I don't want any rabbits.

16:28.898 --> 16:30.232
Yeah, no, I don't like 'em either.

16:30.233 --> 16:32.033
I shoot 'em for Marina.

16:32.034 --> 16:36.104
She's making a bedspread out
of their furs or whatever.

16:36.105 --> 16:38.206
So you want to have a deep and meaningful?

16:38.207 --> 16:40.775
Caleb, look at me!

16:43.245 --> 16:45.280
Life is shit.

16:45.281 --> 16:47.548
It's that way for everyone.

16:47.549 --> 16:50.017
There's only one thing
that makes it better.

16:51.987 --> 16:53.421
Boar jerky.

16:53.422 --> 16:55.189
[laughs]

16:55.190 --> 16:58.158
What the hell is wrong with you, man?

17:00.762 --> 17:01.928
Everything.

17:04.031 --> 17:06.132
I got some whiskey. It'll
make you feel better.

17:06.133 --> 17:07.133
Come on.

17:16.618 --> 17:18.619
If you ever need some extra cash,

17:18.621 --> 17:20.622
just let me know.

17:20.623 --> 17:23.125
You're not gonna live high on the hog

17:23.126 --> 17:25.327
with a medical marijuana crop.

17:29.564 --> 17:31.266
Yeah, no, I don't need anything.

17:31.267 --> 17:33.234
I'm not staying here long anyway, so...

17:33.235 --> 17:35.804
Oh, so...

17:35.805 --> 17:38.840
so you're taking off on the kid, yeah?

17:38.841 --> 17:40.641
Your son?

17:43.445 --> 17:45.112
It's a long story.

17:45.113 --> 17:46.613
I'm only asking 'cause...

17:46.614 --> 17:49.817
I got a job that I think
you might be good for.

17:49.818 --> 17:51.484
That I might be good for?

17:51.485 --> 17:52.652
Yeah.

17:52.653 --> 17:54.521
When the DEA burned this town down,

17:54.522 --> 17:56.523
took my transpo guy with it.

17:56.524 --> 17:58.158
I need a driver.

17:58.159 --> 18:00.493
The guy fled to Puerto Rico.

18:02.562 --> 18:04.864
Who flees to Puerto Rico?

18:06.766 --> 18:10.636
I could think of a million
other place s to flee to.

18:14.441 --> 18:17.543
It pays good.

18:17.544 --> 18:19.544
25 large.

18:19.545 --> 18:22.447
But it's not without risk.

18:24.583 --> 18:27.618
You look like the kind of
guy who can handle risk.

18:31.757 --> 18:35.126
You know, I'm turning over a new leaf.

18:35.127 --> 18:37.828
I got my son.

18:37.829 --> 18:40.464
Well, well,

18:40.465 --> 18:43.267
leaves are leaves,

18:43.268 --> 18:45.836
money is money.

18:48.874 --> 18:51.141
You let me know by the end of the week.

18:59.183 --> 19:00.850
(James) I can't help it.

19:00.851 --> 19:03.086
I'm just, ah, built that way.

19:03.087 --> 19:05.788
Took care of both my parents...

19:05.789 --> 19:08.758
emotionally.

19:08.759 --> 19:12.294
I was raised to study
every breath, every gesture.

19:12.295 --> 19:15.130
It's a survival skill.

19:15.131 --> 19:17.432
I survived.

19:21.337 --> 19:23.305
I never met anyone like you.

19:23.306 --> 19:26.341
Someone who just talks
about things so openly.

19:30.712 --> 19:33.347
Maybe you could actually help me

19:33.348 --> 19:35.749
with some things that I'm going through.

19:35.750 --> 19:38.185
Difficult things.

19:38.186 --> 19:40.754
I... you know where to find me.

19:40.755 --> 19:42.890
Well, actually, I don't.

19:42.891 --> 19:44.891
Your card is in my car.

19:44.892 --> 19:46.826
The one that got towed.

19:46.827 --> 19:49.429
[laughter]

19:49.430 --> 19:52.332
There you go.

19:52.333 --> 19:54.334
Don't lose that one.

19:54.335 --> 19:55.835
Call me anytime.

19:55.836 --> 19:59.306
Okay.

19:59.307 --> 20:01.373
Can I ask you a question?

20:01.374 --> 20:02.774
Of course.

20:02.775 --> 20:05.277
Are you attracted to me?

20:09.215 --> 20:10.382
Where did that come from?

20:10.383 --> 20:11.917
I don't know. You just...

20:11.918 --> 20:15.687
You seem to be all, like, open
and honest about everything.

20:16.789 --> 20:19.190
Are you? Because I think you are.

20:21.160 --> 20:24.395
Yeah, I am.

20:24.396 --> 20:27.731
A lot, to be completely honest.

20:27.732 --> 20:31.802
And... and that's okay for me
to come to you as a patient?

20:31.803 --> 20:32.837
It's okay.

20:32.838 --> 20:35.205
I can handle myself.

20:35.206 --> 20:37.374
Can you handle yourself?

20:40.311 --> 20:41.911
Okay.

20:44.882 --> 20:48.285
Jeez, it's hard to reach
you up in those mountains.

20:48.286 --> 20:50.420
Um, listen, I need to
know if you had any luck

20:50.421 --> 20:52.588
with that, um...

20:52.589 --> 20:56.225
that thing that we were talking about?

20:56.226 --> 20:58.427
Yeah. Just... please call me.

21:00.430 --> 21:02.231
Oh, hi, honey.

21:02.232 --> 21:04.733
I had a late lunch, so I'm
just gonna make you something.

21:04.734 --> 21:06.435
Okay?

21:12.641 --> 21:14.709
Were you wearing that this morning?

21:16.345 --> 21:17.612
Yeah. Why?

21:17.613 --> 21:19.481
No, you were wearing something else...

21:19.482 --> 21:22.283
That blue and white dress. The one I like.

21:24.520 --> 21:26.186
No.

21:32.427 --> 21:34.294
Did I talk to you this morning?

21:38.400 --> 21:41.635
I think that you had a blackout
this morning, sweetheart.

21:44.438 --> 21:46.205
Do you remember anything?

21:47.774 --> 21:49.708
No, I just thought I...

21:49.709 --> 21:51.644
Just thought I talked
to you about something,

21:51.645 --> 21:53.646
but it really doesn't matter.

21:53.647 --> 21:55.314
Was it about something important?

21:55.315 --> 21:57.316
Oh, no. No, it's...

21:58.885 --> 22:01.586
Try not to worry,
Norman. You can't help it.

22:01.587 --> 22:03.721
You know, it isn't
anything you've done wrong.

22:03.722 --> 22:05.490
You understand?

22:09.462 --> 22:10.462
It's okay.

22:10.463 --> 22:12.497
I am here for you.

22:12.498 --> 22:14.732
And will always be here for you.

22:17.602 --> 22:18.702
Yeah.

23:07.750 --> 23:09.750
(Norma Louise) Norman, dinner's ready!

23:19.394 --> 23:20.595
Norman?

23:20.596 --> 23:22.430
Coming, Mother!

24:03.300 --> 24:04.634
Yeah, Gunner, what is it?

24:04.635 --> 24:06.369
Dude, the weirdest thing just happened.

24:06.370 --> 24:08.671
I was screwing with the timer

24:08.672 --> 24:11.474
and the thing fell off and
this flash drive fell out.

24:12.953 --> 24:14.420
Yeah?

24:14.421 --> 24:16.187
Well, I didn't have anything better to do,

24:16.188 --> 24:17.221
with the rain and all,

24:17.222 --> 24:18.689
so I started messing with it.

24:18.690 --> 24:20.325
Anyway, I got it open.

24:20.326 --> 24:21.692
You what?

24:21.693 --> 24:23.694
I opened it with my laptop.

24:25.746 --> 24:27.480
How the hell did you do that?

24:27.481 --> 24:30.583
Dude, I used to download
movies illegally and sell them.

24:30.584 --> 24:32.584
I know my way around encrypted shit.

24:32.585 --> 24:35.119
It took me a while, but I figured it out.

24:35.120 --> 24:37.989
What is it? What's on it?

24:42.328 --> 24:45.263
[water running]

24:48.668 --> 24:49.933
What?

24:56.374 --> 24:57.974
Um...

24:57.975 --> 24:59.476
I found out what was in the flash drive.

24:59.477 --> 25:00.678
- You opened it?
- Yeah.

25:00.679 --> 25:02.680
That's amazing. What is it?

25:02.681 --> 25:06.049
Uh, it's a financial ledger of some kind,

25:06.050 --> 25:08.951
splitting up an investment
return of 15 million dollars.

25:10.654 --> 25:13.389
I'm pretty sure it's illegal
revenue from the drug trade.

25:13.390 --> 25:15.425
I mean, that's the only
thing that would make sense.

25:15.426 --> 25:17.660
It would put half the rich
people in this town in prison.

25:17.661 --> 25:19.195
That might not be such a bad thing.

25:19.196 --> 25:20.963
Are... Are you kidding?

25:20.964 --> 25:22.365
No, that's why this is so important.

25:22.366 --> 25:23.565
This is leverage.

25:23.566 --> 25:24.566
Finally. I could make some demands...

25:24.567 --> 25:26.267
No, no.

25:26.268 --> 25:27.736
I... I... I'm gonna tell Romero, okay?

25:27.737 --> 25:29.738
This... I don't want
anything to happen to you.

25:29.739 --> 25:32.240
- This... This is too big.
- Dylan.

25:32.241 --> 25:33.742
You don't understand what it means to me

25:33.743 --> 25:35.977
to have a family finally.

25:35.978 --> 25:37.646
You can't do this, Norma.

25:39.649 --> 25:41.515
You've got to tell Romero.

26:14.248 --> 26:16.248
Clay, get out of the car.

26:26.292 --> 26:27.626
Clay, get out.

26:27.627 --> 26:29.327
I just want to talk about Lindsay Davis.

26:29.328 --> 26:30.596
Come on, get out of the car.

26:32.230 --> 26:33.731
Come on, Clay. Get out of the car, Clay!

26:33.732 --> 26:35.299
Get out of the car...

26:53.551 --> 26:55.552
[vehicle approaches]

27:08.932 --> 27:10.933
[knocking on door]

27:27.716 --> 27:30.318
Can I trust you?

27:30.319 --> 27:32.219
I mean, like, really trust you.

27:32.220 --> 27:34.489
You know, sometimes you're
Alex, sometimes you're a cop.

27:34.490 --> 27:36.491
I don't know, Norma. I think you can.

27:36.492 --> 27:38.092
I'll do my best.

27:38.093 --> 27:40.461
Okay.

27:40.462 --> 27:41.662
I have it.

27:44.966 --> 27:46.967
Get in here.

27:53.975 --> 27:56.009
All right, give it to me.

27:56.010 --> 27:57.477
It's not on me.

27:57.478 --> 27:59.579
I'm not gonna walk around
with it in my pocket.

27:59.580 --> 28:00.580
I'm not stupid.

28:00.581 --> 28:03.215
It's a business ledger.

28:03.216 --> 28:05.217
Returns on some kind of investment.

28:05.218 --> 28:07.920
15 million dollars.

28:07.921 --> 28:10.957
All the names on it are big,
influential people in this town,

28:10.958 --> 28:13.025
including Bob Paris.

28:13.026 --> 28:15.126
We need to go get it. You need
to give it to me right away.

28:15.127 --> 28:16.561
No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no.

28:16.562 --> 28:19.163
No, that's not why I'm here.

28:19.164 --> 28:21.633
This is the first time since
I've moved to this crummy town

28:21.634 --> 28:23.234
that I have anyone by the short hairs.

28:23.235 --> 28:24.503
I'm getting something out of it.

28:24.504 --> 28:26.204
Have you lost your mind?

28:26.205 --> 28:27.539
Maybe. It's irrelevant.

28:27.540 --> 28:29.407
Listen to me,

28:29.408 --> 28:31.341
I want you to take me to see Bob Paris.

28:31.342 --> 28:33.511
I'm gonna tell him I have it,

28:33.512 --> 28:36.246
and I'm gonna ask for
some favors in return.

28:38.483 --> 28:40.384
Why you looking at me like that?

28:40.385 --> 28:42.586
I've had a good education
in this crappy town.

28:42.587 --> 28:44.388
And I'm ready to play
ball with the big boys.

28:44.389 --> 28:46.289
Play ball... But they'll kill you.

28:46.290 --> 28:47.624
They can't. I have the flash drive.

28:47.625 --> 28:49.626
I'm the only one who knows where it is.

28:49.627 --> 28:52.161
And the two dead girls...
They get no justice?

28:52.162 --> 28:54.296
The dead girl gave it to
me. She wanted me to do this.

28:54.297 --> 28:55.932
She gave it to me before she died.

28:55.933 --> 28:57.634
This is gonna bring those
poor girls back to life...

28:57.635 --> 28:59.636
Norma, think of what people
in this town have done to you.

28:59.637 --> 29:01.504
You don't think I know
what they've done to me?

29:01.505 --> 29:03.406
- You're not gonna extort them.
- They raped me!

29:03.407 --> 29:05.240
They put a dead man's body in my bed.

29:05.241 --> 29:08.309
They kidnapped my child and they
put him in a box in the ground.

29:08.310 --> 29:10.311
What else are they gonna do to me, kill me?

29:10.312 --> 29:12.147
I'm not going down without a fight,

29:12.148 --> 29:13.214
and no one's gonna stop me.

29:13.215 --> 29:14.917
Not you, not Bob Paris,

29:14.918 --> 29:17.385
not all of the scumbag
criminals in White Pine Bay.

29:17.386 --> 29:19.655
You know what? If I was a man,

29:19.656 --> 29:21.356
one of these douche bags who lives here,

29:21.357 --> 29:23.223
you would say that it's totally doable.

29:23.224 --> 29:25.092
You're just saying it's a bad idea

29:25.093 --> 29:28.029
because you think I can't
handle it because I'm a woman.

29:28.030 --> 29:30.031
Because I'm a mother.

29:30.032 --> 29:32.266
I can. I have seen how it's done.

29:32.267 --> 29:34.268
And I will handle it
without you if I have to.

29:41.508 --> 29:43.109
Damn it!

29:43.110 --> 29:44.444
[whimpering]

29:44.445 --> 29:45.612
Damn it!

29:45.613 --> 29:47.614
[crying]

30:00.594 --> 30:02.595
Okay. Okay, I'll do it.

30:02.596 --> 30:04.362
I'll go with you.

30:04.363 --> 30:06.565
Oh...

30:06.566 --> 30:08.433
You will?

30:08.434 --> 30:10.535
Yeah, I said I'll go, and I'll go.

30:32.206 --> 30:34.173
Mr. Paris can see you now.

30:44.350 --> 30:47.285
Bob, this is Norma Bates.

30:47.286 --> 30:48.653
Can I get you guys anything?

30:48.654 --> 30:50.655
Coffee, Perrier, something stronger?

30:50.656 --> 30:52.422
Um, no, thanks. I... I'm good.

30:52.423 --> 30:56.827
No, thanks.

30:56.828 --> 30:58.362
So...

31:00.531 --> 31:02.066
[exhales]

31:02.067 --> 31:03.300
Thank you for coming.

31:03.301 --> 31:04.835
Sure.

31:11.275 --> 31:12.441
Um...

31:12.442 --> 31:14.510
so, uh, I'm here

31:14.511 --> 31:18.181
because I think I may have
something that you want back.

31:24.821 --> 31:26.454
Um, a flash drive?

31:31.727 --> 31:33.262
Um...

31:33.263 --> 31:36.098
so here's what I was thinking,

31:36.099 --> 31:38.600
and you tell me what you think about it.

31:38.601 --> 31:41.403
This bypass that's being built...

31:41.404 --> 31:44.405
It's gonna destroy my business.

31:44.406 --> 31:46.774
I've tried so hard to fight it,

31:46.775 --> 31:49.377
but there's just... There
was nothing I could do.

31:49.378 --> 31:51.578
You know, I... I have no power here.

31:51.579 --> 31:54.115
I tried, I really did... But I don't.

31:54.116 --> 31:56.250
Norma, maybe just cut to the point.

31:56.251 --> 31:58.185
Well, it's kind of all the point.

32:01.222 --> 32:04.090
Anyway, um,

32:04.091 --> 32:06.759
this business of mine
is very important to me.

32:06.760 --> 32:09.162
It is all that I have
to support me and my son,

32:09.163 --> 32:11.497
who has some, uh, medical issues.

32:11.498 --> 32:14.734
And, you know,

32:14.735 --> 32:17.269
I'm kind of in a desperate
position here, you see?

32:17.270 --> 32:19.538
So I was thinking,

32:19.539 --> 32:22.474
since I have this thing that you want back,

32:22.475 --> 32:26.178
that maybe I could ask you
for something in return?

32:27.713 --> 32:31.083
So, um,

32:31.084 --> 32:34.385
I want you to create
an exit off the bypass.

32:34.386 --> 32:36.387
One that would lead to a two-lane highway

32:36.388 --> 32:39.324
that would then easily
connect to Main Street

32:39.325 --> 32:41.125
near my motel,

32:41.126 --> 32:45.430
and, um, I would like a large
billboard just before that exit

32:45.431 --> 32:48.232
on both the North and
South side of the bypass.

32:48.233 --> 32:52.402
And, um, I would like
approval on any design.

32:55.539 --> 32:57.040
And I want a pool.

32:57.041 --> 32:58.741
Doesn't have to be anything fancy,

32:58.742 --> 33:00.577
say, 20 by 40 feet with a Jacuzzi,

33:00.578 --> 33:03.180
and, of course, a fence so that it's safe.

33:08.385 --> 33:10.552
So how do I know you
actually have the flash drive,

33:10.553 --> 33:13.289
that you've opened it?

33:13.290 --> 33:17.293
There are a lot of
important people in this town

33:17.294 --> 33:19.561
who have invested in the drug trade.

33:19.562 --> 33:21.763
I've seen the names.

33:24.468 --> 33:25.467
I see.

33:25.468 --> 33:27.335
And when do I get it back?

33:27.336 --> 33:30.738
Well, maybe not ever, actually.

33:30.739 --> 33:34.509
And it... it won't do you any
good to threaten me or hurt me.

33:34.510 --> 33:36.844
Not that I'm saying that you
would do something like that,

33:36.845 --> 33:40.715
but let's just say, um,
I suddenly go missing

33:40.716 --> 33:42.416
or my brakes suddenly go out,

33:42.417 --> 33:44.418
I will make sure there is one person...

33:44.419 --> 33:45.585
Someone you do not know...

33:45.586 --> 33:47.354
Who knows where that flash drive is,

33:47.355 --> 33:50.224
and I will make sure that as
soon as anything happens to me,

33:50.225 --> 33:52.426
it gets turned over to the FBI.

33:56.431 --> 33:58.065
Hmm.

33:58.066 --> 34:00.066
So I give you all of these things

34:00.067 --> 34:02.368
and you give me nothing?

34:02.369 --> 34:05.538
And then because you
still have the flash drive,

34:05.539 --> 34:08.474
you could come back later
and ask for more stuff.

34:08.475 --> 34:10.743
No, I'm telling you I won't.

34:10.744 --> 34:13.346
I'm making a deal with you, okay?

34:13.347 --> 34:15.481
And I'll honor it, if you do.

34:15.482 --> 34:17.748
So no more asks?

34:17.750 --> 34:19.684
No, none.

34:19.685 --> 34:20.752
Ever.

34:26.292 --> 34:28.293
I have to hand it to you, Norma Bates...

34:30.728 --> 34:32.464
You got me.

34:38.570 --> 34:40.504
Well done, Norma.

34:43.141 --> 34:44.708
We have a deal.

35:11.445 --> 35:13.513
I just wanted to let you know that, uh,

35:13.514 --> 35:15.348
I'm gonna talk to Norma when she gets home

35:15.349 --> 35:17.350
about Caleb being up at my place.

35:17.351 --> 35:20.219
I'm gonna ask her if she
would possibly consider

35:20.220 --> 35:22.187
talking to him.

35:22.188 --> 35:23.888
I don't know what's gonna happen.

35:23.889 --> 35:25.857
It might not be pretty.

35:25.858 --> 35:28.727
So if you want to clear out
until it's over, I understand.

35:33.265 --> 35:34.533
Dylan...

35:39.070 --> 35:40.838
None of this is your fault.

35:42.641 --> 35:44.709
I'll go with you to talk
to her if you want me to.

35:44.710 --> 35:46.544
I'll try and help if I can.

35:46.545 --> 35:48.245
[exhales]

35:48.246 --> 35:50.414
Can't ask you to do that.

35:50.415 --> 35:53.417
I mean, if I get thrown out
of the house, that's on me,

35:53.418 --> 35:56.653
but I can't drag you into it.

35:56.654 --> 36:00.089
No, I feel like this is partly my fault.

36:04.261 --> 36:06.262
There's something wrong with me.

36:08.466 --> 36:09.632
I wanted to destroy you

36:09.633 --> 36:11.400
because you were getting close to her,

36:11.401 --> 36:13.268
and I don't want to be that person.

36:13.269 --> 36:15.270
I hate that person.

36:18.608 --> 36:20.376
I'm a man now.

36:21.878 --> 36:26.415
Not her little boy. And
I want to be a good man.

36:26.416 --> 36:27.750
And I trust your judgment,

36:27.751 --> 36:30.385
if you think this is the right thing to do.

36:32.354 --> 36:33.688
Thank you.

36:35.791 --> 36:38.125
Yeah, you're my, uh, brother.

36:38.126 --> 36:39.794
You know, I want to be there for you.

36:39.795 --> 36:42.397
We're... We're a family.
We love each other.

36:42.398 --> 36:44.766
And we'll work through it.

36:44.767 --> 36:46.767
We'll help her work through it.

36:56.210 --> 36:58.244
Hey, I'm home!

37:00.114 --> 37:03.416
I got a chicken. I'm gonna make a pie.

37:12.459 --> 37:14.427
What's up with you two?

37:18.498 --> 37:19.664
Huh?

37:21.667 --> 37:24.402
Well, no one can be in a
hospital, 'cause we're all here.

37:24.403 --> 37:27.138
[laughs]

37:27.139 --> 37:29.140
What?

37:38.049 --> 37:39.716
I need to tell you something.

37:41.252 --> 37:42.385
What?

37:49.060 --> 37:50.594
Caleb's in town.

37:50.595 --> 37:53.563
He has been in town.
He... He's up at my farm.

37:56.399 --> 37:58.067
Caleb, my brother, Caleb?

37:58.068 --> 38:00.503
Just hear him out, mother.

38:02.706 --> 38:03.773
Okay.

38:09.713 --> 38:13.414
He... he showed up just
after your mother died,

38:13.415 --> 38:15.416
and he tried to offer me a bunch of cash

38:15.417 --> 38:17.586
from the sale of the house,
and I wouldn't take it...

38:17.587 --> 38:19.588
I didn't want anything
to do with him, right?

38:19.589 --> 38:21.523
And...

38:21.524 --> 38:24.759
well, then his car broke down and...

38:24.760 --> 38:28.295
I needed some help building the barn.

38:28.296 --> 38:29.797
He seemed like he had nowhere to go

38:29.798 --> 38:31.665
and I didn't know what to do...

38:35.103 --> 38:37.204
So I let him stay.

38:44.512 --> 38:47.313
He feels horrible about
everything that happened,

38:47.314 --> 38:50.650
about what he did.

38:50.651 --> 38:54.120
I know... I know that this is...

38:54.121 --> 38:58.157
It's a lot to ask you,
I mean, too much, but I...

38:58.158 --> 38:59.826
I just feel like I have to ask,

38:59.827 --> 39:02.360
because he's... He's tormented over this.

39:06.799 --> 39:08.767
He just wants to talk to you.

39:08.768 --> 39:10.669
To tell you that he's sorry.

39:10.670 --> 39:14.439
He... to tell you he's so
sorry that it ever happened.

39:21.580 --> 39:23.581
You have to try and understand,

39:23.582 --> 39:25.282
it's his father.

39:28.286 --> 39:31.188
[slow music]

40:17.499 --> 40:19.200
[vase shatters]

40:23.672 --> 40:25.940
(Norman) Mother?

40:25.941 --> 40:27.240
What are you doing?

40:27.241 --> 40:30.143
[dramatic music]

40:38.285 --> 40:39.385
Mother.

40:44.190 --> 40:45.858
Mother, stop it. You're scaring me!

40:47.594 --> 40:48.628
[crash]

40:53.634 --> 40:55.334
Norma, stop it!

40:55.335 --> 40:57.369
Look, I'll leave. You don't have to.

40:57.370 --> 40:59.171
Leave me the hell alone!

41:01.907 --> 41:03.842
Mother.

41:03.843 --> 41:05.677
Mother! Mother!

41:05.678 --> 41:08.747
Dylan, let me go! Mother!

41:08.748 --> 41:10.548
Dylan, get off me!

41:10.549 --> 41:12.884
Mother!

41:12.885 --> 41:14.152
No!

41:19.891 --> 41:21.258
Mother!

41:21.259 --> 41:23.460
(Dylan) Norman, stop!

41:23.461 --> 41:24.862
Norman, let her go!

41:24.863 --> 41:26.730
(Norman) Mother, you can't do this!

41:26.731 --> 41:29.399
Stop! Norman!

41:29.400 --> 41:30.734
Mother!

41:30.735 --> 41:32.502
Your brother will look after you!

41:32.503 --> 41:34.837
She can't do this! She can't leave me!

41:34.838 --> 41:36.572
Emma, go back in the office now!

41:36.573 --> 41:37.774
What's wrong?

41:37.775 --> 41:39.308
Go back!

41:39.309 --> 41:40.743
Norman!

41:40.744 --> 41:42.578
You can't do this!

41:42.579 --> 41:44.681
Stop!

41:44.682 --> 41:46.215
Norman.

41:49.119 --> 41:51.154
Norman, let her go!

41:52.488 --> 41:54.255
Mother!
