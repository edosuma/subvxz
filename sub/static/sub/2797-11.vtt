00:15.333 --> 00:16.834
Attention, students.

00:16.917 --> 00:20.250
The moment you lined up for
is almost upon us.

00:20.333 --> 00:21.583
Come on, back up.
Back up!

00:21.667 --> 00:23.375
Savesies. Savesies!

00:23.458 --> 00:25.875
As you know, last month
our beloved cafeteria

00:25.959 --> 00:28.417
was destroyed by
a certain mutated student

00:28.500 --> 00:29.917
who shall remain nameless.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
He gots a name!
It's Bucky!

00:32.083 --> 00:33.834
Says so right here
in his underwears!

00:33.917 --> 00:35.667
No wedgies!
See you in detention.

00:35.750 --> 00:38.834
Now, while the Ninja was able
to protect our students...

00:38.917 --> 00:40.458
Woot, woot! Ninja!

00:40.542 --> 00:42.208
...he was unable to protect

00:42.291 --> 00:44.375
the tables, chairs,
floors and ceiling.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.208
But only four short weeks

00:47.291 --> 00:49.250
and one year's Twirl Team
budget later...

00:49.333 --> 00:50.667
That is so the boo.

00:50.750 --> 00:53.959
...we are ready to open
our new cafeteria!

00:54.041 --> 00:56.792
Now, I know you've
all lined up to "score"

00:56.875 --> 01:00.000
the "illest" table,
but let me assure you

01:00.083 --> 01:02.583
they are all equally ill.

01:02.667 --> 01:04.250
Wrong-o,
Slim-Diggity.

01:04.333 --> 01:07.625
There is one that stands
above the rest.

01:07.709 --> 01:09.125
Tab-el-Dorado!

01:09.208 --> 01:11.166
Wait, I thought
we settled on Shangri-lunch.

01:11.250 --> 01:13.125
Oh, yeah,
that's way better.

01:13.208 --> 01:14.208
Shangri-lunch.

01:14.291 --> 01:16.458
The single
greatest place to sit

01:16.542 --> 01:18.041
in all of the lunch room.

01:18.125 --> 01:20.250
Perfect proximity
to the snack bar.

01:20.333 --> 01:21.917
Centrally located
for hearing

01:22.000 --> 01:23.792
what's up
with the what's up.

01:23.875 --> 01:26.291
And thanks to a perfectly
positioned skylight,

01:26.375 --> 01:29.041
even the lighting
makes you look cooler.

01:29.125 --> 01:31.959
Shangri-lunch,
here we come.

01:32.041 --> 01:34.834
I hereby declare
this cafeteria...

01:34.917 --> 01:36.750
...a place to eat!

01:36.834 --> 01:38.250
(all shouting)

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Come on, Howard!
Pick up the pace.

01:43.875 --> 01:45.166
Howard, look out!

01:51.458 --> 01:53.041
Sit on this!
'Cause it's a chair.

01:53.125 --> 01:54.458
And you sit on it.

01:58.417 --> 02:00.417
Oursies!

02:00.500 --> 02:02.625
Howard.
That was incredible!

02:02.709 --> 02:05.166
I know. Those donuts
were gluten-free.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.959
Didn't think I could
keep 'em down.

02:07.041 --> 02:09.667
Shangri-lunch.
Oh, it's ours.

02:09.750 --> 02:11.792
This is the beginning
of something big, Howard.

02:11.875 --> 02:14.291
Things are about to change
for us, I can feel it.

02:14.375 --> 02:16.625
New cafeteria rules:
No sprinting.

02:16.709 --> 02:17.792
See ya in detention.

02:17.875 --> 02:20.041
(playing sad trombone)

02:20.125 --> 02:21.250
(groaning)

02:21.333 --> 02:23.041
Thanks for saving
my table for me!

02:23.125 --> 02:25.083
No, Bash.
We got here first.

02:25.166 --> 02:27.000
First is for losers!

02:28.709 --> 02:31.041
(sad trombone)

02:31.125 --> 02:33.000
-Bash...
-...is a jerk.

02:33.083 --> 02:36.041
Also, we now have a strict
"no soaring" policy.

02:36.125 --> 02:39.709
-See you in detention.
-(sad trombone muffled)

02:39.792 --> 02:42.667
Three times?
Really, Stevens?

02:42.750 --> 02:43.750
(scoffing)

02:43.834 --> 02:45.834
What I wouldn't give
to jam that trombone

02:45.917 --> 02:47.709
straight up
Stevens' wah-wah.

02:47.792 --> 02:49.834
Maybe you can.

02:49.917 --> 02:53.041
All you have to do
is roll.

02:53.125 --> 02:54.041
(giggling)

02:54.125 --> 02:55.417
What the juice?

02:55.500 --> 02:56.834
Cunningham,
don't talk to them

02:56.917 --> 02:59.041
or we're gonna wind up
sitting at their table.

02:59.125 --> 03:01.834
Welcome to
Der Monster Klub!

03:01.917 --> 03:03.709
"Cloob?"
What's a "cloob?"

03:03.792 --> 03:05.750
It's the better, more
strangely European way

03:05.834 --> 03:08.792
of saying "club."
I am your Klub-Master!

03:08.875 --> 03:11.125
Your roll,
Accordion David.

03:12.792 --> 03:16.000
Yes, a four.
I give Bash a wedgie.

03:16.083 --> 03:18.291
Is this one of those
in-your-head games?

03:18.375 --> 03:21.291
'Cause I'm so not down
with imagination.

03:21.375 --> 03:23.417
Every day at lunch,
we play as monsters,

03:23.500 --> 03:25.959
pretending to strike fear in
the hearts of jerks everywhere!

03:26.041 --> 03:27.667
Like Stevens.
He sad-trombones me

03:27.750 --> 03:29.625
every time I drop
a juggling pin.

03:29.709 --> 03:30.834
Every time!

03:30.917 --> 03:33.792
(playing sad trombone)

03:33.875 --> 03:35.333
And Bash.
He resents me

03:35.417 --> 03:37.083
for my great skill
on the accordion.

03:37.166 --> 03:38.625
(playing discordant notes)

03:38.709 --> 03:39.750
And Slimovitz.

03:39.834 --> 03:42.542
This is for canceling
Twirl Team!

03:42.625 --> 03:44.000
Uh, what about the Ninja?

03:44.083 --> 03:47.166
In this world,
there are only monsters.

03:47.250 --> 03:49.166
There is no Ninja.

03:49.250 --> 03:51.125
-(giggling)
-(gasping)

03:53.125 --> 03:54.709
Ha! A nine.

03:54.792 --> 03:56.959
I'm giving the Lunch Lady
a swirlie!

03:58.458 --> 03:59.917
Cunningham, you gotta
try this game.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.792
It's the cheese.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.792
Yes, come, Randy.

04:03.875 --> 04:07.250
Savor the power
of Der Monster Klub!

04:19.750 --> 04:22.208
Eh, it's just a game.

04:22.291 --> 04:23.333

-What just happened?

04:46.792 --> 04:49.000
You rolled
the dreaded five.

04:49.083 --> 04:50.750
'Tis the fifth day
in a row

04:50.834 --> 04:53.709
your enemy has worn
his underpants.

04:53.792 --> 04:56.250
Therefore,
he turns into a...

04:56.333 --> 04:57.208
...a monster!

04:57.291 --> 04:58.417
What?

04:58.500 --> 05:00.458
No, that's not how you
turn into a monster.

05:00.542 --> 05:02.583
Guys, you turn into a monster
when you get bummed.

05:02.667 --> 05:04.667
Like humiliated or something
like that, like there's...

05:04.750 --> 05:06.291
Cunningham!

05:07.333 --> 05:08.458
Or...

05:08.542 --> 05:10.291
...the underpants thing
makes a ton of sense.

05:10.375 --> 05:12.083
Of course.
Bummedness!

05:12.166 --> 05:13.333
That's the key!

05:13.417 --> 05:14.417
(giggling)

05:14.500 --> 05:16.375
My dear Klubers,
forgive me

05:16.458 --> 05:18.875
for the humiliation
I'm about to inflict.

05:18.959 --> 05:21.750
Attention, classmates.
I must inform you

05:21.834 --> 05:23.583
that Juggo sleeps
with a stuffed kitty

05:23.667 --> 05:25.291
named Admiral Cuddles.

05:25.375 --> 05:26.834
You said what happens
at sleepovers

05:26.917 --> 05:28.375
stays at sleepovers!

05:28.458 --> 05:30.166
(all laughing)

05:30.250 --> 05:32.333
And my good friend
Accordion Dave

05:32.417 --> 05:34.291
shaves his butt.

05:34.375 --> 05:35.875
If I don't,
it looks like

05:35.959 --> 05:37.625
I'm wearing
fur underpants.

05:37.709 --> 05:39.542
(all laughing)

05:39.625 --> 05:41.250
And Theresa...

05:41.333 --> 05:42.709
Julian, don't you say it!

05:42.792 --> 05:44.542
(laughter echoing)

05:44.625 --> 05:46.750
(sniffing)

05:46.834 --> 05:51.667
Ah. I have not sniffed this
much simultaneous humiliation

05:51.750 --> 05:55.500
since the Great
De-Pantsing of '81!

05:55.583 --> 05:57.750
The moment of my escape
is nigh!

05:57.834 --> 05:59.750
-(squeaking)
-It means "near."

05:59.834 --> 06:02.709
Now back up.
You're standing too nigh.

06:02.792 --> 06:04.417
(laughing maniacally)

06:05.750 --> 06:08.250
Like none of you have
ever tasted it before!

06:08.333 --> 06:09.792
(all laughing)

06:14.750 --> 06:16.917
(all shouting)

06:17.000 --> 06:19.625
Yes! It's working.

06:19.709 --> 06:21.458
Go, my Klub.

06:21.542 --> 06:25.375
The power of monster
is yours!

06:25.458 --> 06:27.458
That's right.
The ad should say

06:27.542 --> 06:30.083
"For Sale: 200
Gently Twirled Batons."

06:30.166 --> 06:31.542
(screeching)

06:31.625 --> 06:33.083
I'm gonna have
to call you back.

06:47.417 --> 06:49.834

Cunningham.

06:56.208 --> 06:59.041
Epic. Brain. Fart.

06:59.875 --> 07:02.208
I have to stop them.

07:02.291 --> 07:04.625
Or you could
just let it happen.

07:04.709 --> 07:06.166
The monsters
get to monster

07:06.250 --> 07:08.166
and we get
Shangri-Lunch back.

07:08.250 --> 07:10.291
(muttering) No!

07:10.375 --> 07:11.750
I have to fix this.

07:11.834 --> 07:13.875
Oh, you're
out of the Klub.

07:17.959 --> 07:19.458
-You stupid jerk!
-(discordant accordion)

07:19.542 --> 07:21.959
-Put me down!

07:22.041 --> 07:24.834
-Dave, drop the...
-No, Ninja.

07:24.917 --> 07:26.583
Don't stop
Dave's rampage.

07:26.667 --> 07:27.792
Sorry, Julian.

07:27.875 --> 07:30.792
Nobody gets monstered
on my watch.

07:32.083 --> 07:33.792
-Dave, drop the...
-No, Ninja!

07:33.875 --> 07:36.125
No!
Would you stop that?

07:36.208 --> 07:37.875
Ninja Wrap!

07:37.959 --> 07:40.000
It's not fair!
You're ruining it.

07:40.083 --> 07:42.125
You're ruining everything!
(sobbing)

07:42.208 --> 07:46.000
Four monsters
for the price of one.

07:46.083 --> 07:49.083
I love a bargain.

07:53.583 --> 07:55.291
(shouting)

07:56.125 --> 07:57.625
Bash, run!

07:57.709 --> 08:00.375
You run!
(shouting)

08:00.458 --> 08:02.709
Got the table back.
You want in?

08:11.250 --> 08:12.250
Yah!

08:13.834 --> 08:16.333
Ninja Glow Balls!

08:16.417 --> 08:17.625
Hey! Check it out.

08:17.709 --> 08:19.834
I'm stuck in some kinda
sticky stringy thing

08:19.917 --> 08:21.667
that came out of
a spider's butt!

08:21.750 --> 08:23.834
It's a web.
Sweet school board,

08:23.917 --> 08:25.750
I need to have a talk
with the Science Department.

08:25.834 --> 08:27.250
Oh, also
get me down!

08:27.333 --> 08:29.750
-(screeching)
-What the juice?

08:31.709 --> 08:35.667
Yikes! Whoa.

08:35.750 --> 08:36.750
Why am I not landing?

08:37.917 --> 08:39.250
Listen, Monster Klub...

08:39.333 --> 08:40.333
Kloob.

08:40.417 --> 08:42.417
Kloob, I know
that you feel

08:42.500 --> 08:44.166
powerless and weak
and picked on.

08:44.250 --> 08:46.834
But mutating yourselves into
hideous rampaging monsters

08:46.917 --> 08:48.291
is never the answer.

08:48.375 --> 08:51.542
If you do this,
you're as bad as they are.

08:51.625 --> 08:54.000
No! It came out
of his butt.

08:54.083 --> 08:56.875
Now we finish the game.

08:58.250 --> 09:00.041
A four?
That's wedgies.

09:00.125 --> 09:01.834
Everyone's getting wedgies!

09:01.917 --> 09:04.750
Please, I'll find the money
for Twirl Team.

09:04.834 --> 09:06.709
Just leave
my skivvies alone.

09:06.792 --> 09:10.000
(groaning) Ninja Finger
Slicey Thingies!

09:10.083 --> 09:11.959
Time for
a bulk de-stanking.

09:12.041 --> 09:15.583
How do you destank
an entire Klub?

09:15.667 --> 09:17.208
Twenty-sided die.

09:17.291 --> 09:18.959
It's my roll, Julian.

09:19.041 --> 09:20.750
Stop him!

09:30.542 --> 09:32.291
Ninja Stretch.

09:33.667 --> 09:35.625
Ninja Helicopter
Baton Flying Maneuver!

09:40.959 --> 09:43.875
Huh?
(groaning)

09:47.583 --> 09:48.667
(growling)

09:53.709 --> 09:55.709
Next time, Ninja.

09:55.792 --> 09:57.667
Next time!

09:57.750 --> 09:59.667
(squeaking)

10:01.083 --> 10:03.333
(Dave) Hey, you there.
Help me, I'm stuck!

10:03.417 --> 10:05.917
What happened?
I don't remember anything.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.709
Nothing?
So you don't remember

10:07.792 --> 10:09.166
how to become
a monster?

10:09.250 --> 10:11.208
-Well, I remember that.
-(groaning)

10:11.291 --> 10:13.291
You wear the same underpants
five days in a row.

10:13.375 --> 10:15.875
(laughing) You keep on
believin' that, buddy.

10:15.959 --> 10:18.250
Smokebomb!

10:18.333 --> 10:21.291
Uh, Ninja.
'Scuse me?

10:21.375 --> 10:23.291
You gonna...
You gonna cut us down?

10:23.375 --> 10:24.834
(sad trombone)

10:25.875 --> 10:27.208
See this is why

10:27.291 --> 10:28.875
getting the perfect table
is so important.

10:28.959 --> 10:30.792
You sat with the weirdoes
for ten minutes

10:30.875 --> 10:32.417
and you started
a monster uprising!

10:32.500 --> 10:34.709
So I accidentally
told them a Ninja secret.

10:34.792 --> 10:36.875
The important thing is
I fixed it.

10:36.959 --> 10:38.834
I stopped the Klub.

10:38.917 --> 10:40.625
No, the important thing is,

10:40.709 --> 10:42.792
while you were running
around like a shoob,

10:42.875 --> 10:44.750
I got us Shangri-Lunch.

10:44.834 --> 10:47.917
That you did, Big H.
That you did.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.417
People, if we're gonna make
this Lunch-Nasium work

10:51.500 --> 10:52.959
while the gym's
being repaired,

10:53.041 --> 10:54.667
we're gonna need
some rules.

10:54.750 --> 10:57.750
Basketballs on the left,
meatballs on the right!

11:10.834 --> 11:13.417
Howard, this is the greatest
night of our lives.

11:13.500 --> 11:14.667
(both grunting)

11:14.750 --> 11:16.750
Grave Puncher,
the greatest video game

11:16.834 --> 11:18.500
since I don't know when

11:18.583 --> 11:21.417
has been made
into a movie!

11:21.500 --> 11:24.667
Nothing will stop us from
seeing the world premiere

11:24.750 --> 11:27.250
of Grave Puncher:
The Movie.

11:27.333 --> 11:29.166
(both) IN 6-D!

11:29.250 --> 11:30.834
(both chortling)

11:30.917 --> 11:33.583
(gasping) Huh?

11:33.667 --> 11:35.125
Would you Butt Punchers
keep it down?

11:35.208 --> 11:36.959
I'm trying to study
for my driver's test.

11:37.041 --> 11:39.667
Which is why my colleague
Randy and I

11:39.750 --> 11:42.625
will be taking in the midnight
show of a certain cinema film

11:42.709 --> 11:44.917
that involves the mass
punching of graves.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.333
It's Grave Puncher.
They made it into a movie.

11:47.417 --> 11:49.542
-And it is 6-D.
-Are you crazy?

11:49.625 --> 11:52.000
Mom and Dad would never
let you go to a midnight movie.

11:52.083 --> 11:54.667
Exactly! That's why
we're going tonight,

11:54.750 --> 11:56.667
while they're out. Duh.

11:56.750 --> 11:59.458
Oh, no. No way.
They left me in charge.

11:59.542 --> 12:01.792
OK? I'm responsible.
You and Mandy...

12:01.875 --> 12:03.375
Randy. It's always
been Randy.

12:03.458 --> 12:05.291
...are not going to
a midnight movie!

12:05.375 --> 12:07.792
-Yes, we are.
-No, you're not!

12:07.875 --> 12:08.875
(door locking)

12:10.625 --> 12:12.834
(grunting)

12:12.917 --> 12:15.709
Oh, man, the door's locked.
We're trapped!

12:15.792 --> 12:17.333
We're not gonna get
to see Grave Puncher...

12:17.417 --> 12:18.667
Howard, chill.

12:18.750 --> 12:21.667
It's the only screening
of GPTM 6-D in the world.

12:21.750 --> 12:23.166
We are gonna
see that movie.

12:23.250 --> 12:26.083
But we're trapped in a
maximum-security basement,

12:26.166 --> 12:28.625
almost below ground level.
We'd have to escape

12:28.709 --> 12:30.166
without the guard
discovering we're gone.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.959
-We are totally shoobed!
-Or are we?

12:33.041 --> 12:35.792
I think this situation
calls for a little shloomp

12:35.875 --> 12:37.667
into the NinjaNomicon.

12:37.750 --> 12:39.333
(grunting)

12:40.875 --> 12:44.709
(Randy) "The Art of Escape."
Oh, bing. Go!

12:48.750 --> 12:51.583
OK, bag.
Making a dummy.

12:51.667 --> 12:53.834
Window.
That's how you escape.

12:53.917 --> 12:56.417
Booyah, I got it.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.709
"Deceit often comes
at a price."

12:58.792 --> 13:00.250
Oh, yeah, it does.

13:00.333 --> 13:03.500
The price of two tickets
and a large poppy-corn!

13:29.125 --> 13:31.750
(shouting) No!

13:33.250 --> 13:35.500
Easy, boy.
Movie hasn't started yet.

13:35.583 --> 13:36.834
We already know
the Art of Escape.

13:36.917 --> 13:39.291
All we have to do
is escape backwards.

13:39.375 --> 13:40.834
Manhole.
I'll Ninja-out,

13:40.917 --> 13:42.917
then we'll sneak under
the theater through the sewer,

13:43.000 --> 13:44.792
climb up the plumbing
into the bathroom,

13:44.875 --> 13:48.333
hose off, de-suit,
and boom! We are in.

13:48.417 --> 13:51.417
Or we could climb that ladder
into that window.

13:51.500 --> 13:53.709
Hmm. Yeah, no, we could...
we could do that.

13:53.792 --> 13:55.875
-(projector running)
-(Randy) Mmm-hmm.

13:55.959 --> 13:58.375
-Hey, boss, you OK?
-I'm a Ninja.

13:58.458 --> 14:00.709
I think I can handle...

14:00.792 --> 14:01.750
(crackling)

14:01.834 --> 14:03.458
Way to stuff the entry,
Cunningham.

14:03.542 --> 14:05.083
Why don't you make
some more noise?

14:05.166 --> 14:06.417
Hey, you just
gonna stand here

14:06.500 --> 14:07.834
or you gonna help me
clean this off?

14:07.917 --> 14:10.750
I'm just gonna stand here.
Hey, you asked.

14:10.834 --> 14:12.375
Hurry up!

14:12.458 --> 14:14.083
Watching you clean up
those McSquiddles

14:14.166 --> 14:17.375
reminded me that I wanted you
to buy me some McSquiddles.

14:20.208 --> 14:21.250
(farting)

14:21.333 --> 14:22.750
(scoffs) Gross.

14:22.834 --> 14:24.041
(sniffing)

14:24.125 --> 14:27.000
This room doesn't smell
like sleep farts.

14:30.625 --> 14:32.792
(Heidi shouting)
Howard!

14:32.875 --> 14:35.500
<i>♪ Movie time</i>
<i>Let's go to the movies ♪</i>

14:35.583 --> 14:37.583
<i>♪ Get your popcorn ♪</i>

14:37.667 --> 14:39.709
Slappage!

14:39.792 --> 14:41.792
Why'd you
pinch off the slap?

14:41.875 --> 14:42.792
(high voice)
Over there.

14:42.875 --> 14:44.750
Look over there!

14:47.083 --> 14:48.792
Let's just
casually stand up

14:48.875 --> 14:51.000
-and go find other seats.
-Forget it, Cunningham!

14:51.083 --> 14:52.875
These were the last
empty seats in the house.

14:52.959 --> 14:55.458
Deal with it.
There's nowhere else to sit.

14:55.542 --> 14:57.417
(slurping)

14:58.875 --> 15:01.000
You feel that?
I just got chills.

15:01.083 --> 15:03.291
Why would I feel
you get chills?

15:03.375 --> 15:05.417
Because chills
is a side effect

15:05.500 --> 15:08.667
of my new 6-D
McFist-O-Vision system.

15:08.750 --> 15:11.208
It uses the latest
in laser-guided,

15:11.291 --> 15:13.375
cybernetic,
holographic technology

15:13.458 --> 15:16.458
to create the ultimate
cinematic experience.

15:16.542 --> 15:17.875
I'll be the judge of that.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.709
(Heidi) I am not gonna
let stupid Howard

15:19.792 --> 15:21.709
keep me from studying
for my driver's test.

15:21.792 --> 15:24.166
Coming to a complete stop.
Check for oncoming traffic.

15:24.250 --> 15:26.250
Left signal,
and we're moving.

15:26.333 --> 15:28.458
Ah, this is nice,

15:28.542 --> 15:30.625
us at the movies together.

15:30.709 --> 15:32.667
Your knee
is touching my knee.

15:32.750 --> 15:35.583
Mmm-hmm.

15:35.667 --> 15:37.083
(audience gasping)

15:41.959 --> 15:43.583
(Randy and Howard)
Grave Puncher!

15:43.667 --> 15:45.750
In 6-D!!

15:47.250 --> 15:48.709
(audience reacting)

15:48.792 --> 15:50.625
(growling)

15:50.709 --> 15:52.458
(laughing)

15:52.542 --> 15:54.834
Did I tell you
or did I tell you?

15:56.333 --> 15:58.041
Ooh, there he is,
there he is!

15:58.125 --> 16:00.542
-Puncher!
-I love you, Puncher!

16:00.625 --> 16:02.000
Ooo, here comes
my favorite part.

16:02.083 --> 16:03.250
Watch. Right...

16:03.333 --> 16:05.792
Viceroy, if you don't
stop talking I'm gonna...

16:05.875 --> 16:08.166
You just got 6-Ded.

16:08.250 --> 16:10.458
Hard.

16:10.542 --> 16:13.000
<i>One of you tombstones</i>
<i>killed my mama.</i>

16:13.083 --> 16:14.750
<i>You all gonna pay.</i>

16:14.834 --> 16:16.333
<i>With punches!</i>

16:17.959 --> 16:21.291
So honkin' Bruce!

16:21.375 --> 16:22.834
Can't black out!

16:22.917 --> 16:25.375
Must watch awesome movie!

16:26.208 --> 16:27.583
(crackling)

16:40.208 --> 16:42.875
Well, what do
we have here?

16:42.959 --> 16:45.709
A grave new world.

16:45.792 --> 16:47.542
To punch!

16:48.834 --> 16:51.875
Yow! That's some
high-voltage punch-ocity!

16:51.959 --> 16:53.917
Whoo-hoo!

16:54.000 --> 16:56.667
This movie's better
than the video game.

16:56.750 --> 16:58.583
Puncher, over here!

16:58.667 --> 16:59.750
Punch me!

16:59.834 --> 17:01.917
Jab! Jab!
Bolo Punch!

17:02.000 --> 17:03.709
Right. Left. Right.

17:03.792 --> 17:05.792
In the mouth.
In your face.

17:05.875 --> 17:08.083
Jab! Jab! Jab!
(laughing)

17:10.041 --> 17:11.792
I gotta hand it
to you, Viceroy,

17:11.875 --> 17:14.542
this 6-D
is blowin' my mind.

17:14.625 --> 17:16.709
-Jab!
-Oh, no.

17:16.792 --> 17:19.208
This isn't 6-D.
It's 7-D.

17:19.291 --> 17:20.709
What the juice
is 7-D?

17:20.792 --> 17:23.458
It's the D that comes
right after six.

17:23.542 --> 17:26.709
Seven-D creates a tear in
the fabric of space and time,

17:26.792 --> 17:29.667
allowing fictional characters
to enter our world.

17:29.750 --> 17:30.792
And punch us!

17:32.041 --> 17:33.709
You're telling me
this thing's for real?

17:36.041 --> 17:38.792
That look like
special effects to you?

17:38.875 --> 17:41.542
(screaming)

17:41.625 --> 17:43.834
Make it stop
punching my theater!

17:43.917 --> 17:45.750
I would if I knew how.

17:45.834 --> 17:47.834
Something must have happened
to the projector.

17:50.458 --> 17:51.709
(gasping)

17:51.792 --> 17:53.667
Howard, the Puncher
is real!

17:53.750 --> 17:56.375
And I think McSquiddling
the projector made it happen.

17:56.458 --> 17:57.750
This is all our fault.

17:57.834 --> 17:59.750
I don't care.

17:59.834 --> 18:01.667
This is the greatest
motion picture of all time.

18:01.750 --> 18:02.750
Now stop talking.

18:04.375 --> 18:07.875
I knew I should have gone to
<i>The Love That Never Loves!</i>

18:07.959 --> 18:10.000
-Upper-cut! Body-pound!
-He's coming.

18:10.083 --> 18:13.083
-Get me outta this thing!
-I am so conflicted.

18:13.166 --> 18:14.667
Our lives are in danger,

18:14.750 --> 18:16.166
but this may be
my only chance

18:16.250 --> 18:18.000
to meet Brock Octane
face-to-fist.

18:18.083 --> 18:19.083
Get me out!

18:22.625 --> 18:24.542
Hello, I'm Hannibal McFist.

18:24.625 --> 18:25.625
Due to a technical glitch,

18:25.709 --> 18:27.000
the Puncher has come
out of the movie

18:27.083 --> 18:30.166
and is on a rampage.
No need to panic.

18:30.250 --> 18:32.792
(all screaming)

18:34.125 --> 18:35.250
Howard! Get down.

18:35.333 --> 18:37.333
No! We risked everything
to see this

18:37.417 --> 18:38.875
and I have to see
how it ends.

18:38.959 --> 18:40.667
It ends with you
getting obliterated.

18:40.750 --> 18:44.166
Unless the Ninja
makes a cameo.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.583
Checking rearview mirror.
Glancing over shoulder.

18:48.667 --> 18:49.583
Backing up.

18:49.667 --> 18:52.667
Movie was halfway over.
No refunds!

18:52.750 --> 18:53.792
(gasping)

18:53.875 --> 18:55.250
(laughing)

18:55.333 --> 18:56.709
Howard!

18:56.792 --> 18:58.333
I am taking you
home right...

18:58.417 --> 19:00.542
(screaming)

19:00.625 --> 19:02.542
Hey!
Thanks, Grave Puncher!

19:02.625 --> 19:03.834
(Randy) Smokebomb!

19:03.917 --> 19:05.083
I gotta admit, Puncher,

19:05.166 --> 19:07.625
I'm kinda geekin' out
right now.

19:09.375 --> 19:11.750
Welcome to the party,
Player 2.

19:11.834 --> 19:13.583
Prepare to get punched!

19:13.667 --> 19:15.667
(shouting)

19:15.750 --> 19:18.709
Clouds, wind, chicken...
Ninja Air Fist!

19:21.083 --> 19:23.291
OK, that Air Fist
shoulda worked.

19:23.375 --> 19:25.917
Yippey-ki-yay,
other puncher!

19:26.000 --> 19:27.041
Ninja Roundhouse!

19:29.834 --> 19:32.166
Mmm-hmm.

19:32.250 --> 19:33.625
Sheesh.

19:35.750 --> 19:36.959
Nothing's working.

19:37.041 --> 19:38.834
Throw the Haymaker.
Trust me.

19:38.917 --> 19:41.250
I beat my best friend
with that move all the time.

19:41.333 --> 19:44.000
The juice you do.
Ninja Haymaker!

19:45.709 --> 19:47.583
-Now hit him with the...
-I know!

19:47.667 --> 19:50.709
I've only played the game
a ka-trillion times.

19:50.792 --> 19:52.500
Ninja Jab!
Ninja Hammer Fist!

19:52.583 --> 19:55.000
Ninja Upset Punch!
Shovel Hook!

19:55.083 --> 19:57.750
I don't get it!
That combo should have

19:57.834 --> 19:59.375
taken you straight
to the bonus round.

20:02.083 --> 20:04.417
"Deceit often
comes at a price."

20:04.500 --> 20:07.208
We caused the mess.
We gotta pay the price.

20:07.291 --> 20:09.792
I have to destroy
the projector.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.041
But that's
the only 6-D version

20:11.125 --> 20:13.208
of Grave Puncher:
The Movie in existence!

20:13.291 --> 20:15.667
It's the price
we have to pay.

20:15.750 --> 20:17.542
There can be
only one puncher!

20:17.625 --> 20:19.792
Ninja Tengu-Fire Ball!

20:19.875 --> 20:21.625
No!

20:25.583 --> 20:26.917
Hey!

20:27.000 --> 20:28.709
That's for
ruining the movie!

20:28.792 --> 20:31.291
-(groaning)
-(Viceroy) Ooh...

20:31.375 --> 20:33.959
Seven-D. This is
all your fault!

20:34.041 --> 20:36.375
Oww! Best movie ever!

20:36.458 --> 20:38.875
I can't wait to fork
over my hard-earned cash

20:38.959 --> 20:40.917
to see it
again and again!

20:41.000 --> 20:42.959
And again!

20:43.041 --> 20:46.333
Seven-D.
This was all my idea!

20:46.417 --> 20:47.500
Get the theater ready.

20:47.583 --> 20:48.959
We're trashin' it
again tomorrow.

20:49.041 --> 20:50.417
-But we can't...
-Tomorrow!

20:50.500 --> 20:51.542
Yes, sir.

20:53.083 --> 20:55.834
Howard Weinerman,
you are so dead!

20:55.917 --> 20:57.792
I'm sorry, Heidi.
We're not here right now.

20:57.875 --> 20:59.792
We're at home
sleep-farting in bed.

20:59.875 --> 21:01.417
Hello?
Hey, Mom.

21:01.500 --> 21:03.041
Yeah, I know he's not.

21:03.125 --> 21:04.834
They went to
a midnight movie.

21:04.917 --> 21:06.583
I didn't let them!

21:06.667 --> 21:08.959
How is this my fault?
That's not fair!

21:09.041 --> 21:11.875
Well, Cunningham,
another happy ending.

21:14.333 --> 21:17.083
We can't let Heidi pay
the price for our deceit.

21:17.166 --> 21:19.792
Mrs. Weinerman,
we snuck out.

21:19.875 --> 21:21.750
Heidi had nothing
to do with this.

21:21.834 --> 21:23.000
This is Randy,
by the way.

21:23.083 --> 21:24.834
Oh. Thanks, Sandy.

21:24.917 --> 21:27.458
It's Randy,
I just said it.

21:27.542 --> 21:31.417
<i>Five, four, three, two...</i>

21:31.500 --> 21:33.000
<i>...and ungrounded!</i>

21:33.083 --> 21:34.959
Stuck in my bedroom
for a week.

21:35.041 --> 21:36.792
That was the hardest time
I've ever done.

21:36.875 --> 21:38.750
-(birds chirping)
-So what do you wanna do now?

21:38.834 --> 21:40.208
<i>Hmm, wanna play</i>
<i>more Grave Puncher?</i>

21:40.291 --> 21:42.083
Allow me to answer
that question

21:42.166 --> 21:43.667
with a question.

21:43.750 --> 21:46.041
<i>Who's ready to</i>
<i>punch and roll!</i>

21:47.834 --> 21:50.834
(theme music playing)
