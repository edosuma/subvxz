Jane, what were you doing there?

Target practice. I try to go once a month.

04:16.675 --> 04:18.427
- You were doing target practice?
- Mmm-hmm.

04:20.011 --> 04:21.137
You seem suspicious.

04:21.221 --> 04:24.516
Well, we're going on a road trip
to go meet the person that assaulted you,

04:24.599 --> 04:27.310
and you're doing target practice?
I'm not suspicious at all.

04:29.229 --> 04:30.522

- I just...

04:31.523 --> 04:32.941
I have a thing about guns to begin with.

04:33.024 --> 04:36.611
Nathan and I used to fight about it constantly.
He's obsessed with guns.

04:37.028 --> 04:38.905
All those mass shootings. I don't know.

04:39.197 --> 04:41.032
It's actually helped me a lot, owning one.

04:41.199 --> 04:42.284
Really?

04:42.534 --> 04:43.952
They say, just holding one in your hand

04:44.035 --> 04:46.496
has psychological benefits
for emotional trauma.

04:46.580 --> 04:48.415
- Oh, I didn't know that.
- Mm-hmm.

04:48.540 --> 04:50.375
Yeah, because it inhibits mentalization,

04:50.459 --> 04:52.878
so it helps you block yourself off
from emotions.

04:53.879 --> 04:55.380
- And that's a good thing?
- Yeah.

04:55.547 --> 04:58.216

absolutely.

04:59.301 --> 05:02.888

05:07.976 --> 05:09.394

06:25.470 --> 06:28.056
And you never let a bully win.

06:28.139 --> 06:31.142
Do you hear me?
You have to speak up, Amabella.

06:31.476 --> 06:34.479
You have to be a big girl
and use your voice in this world.

06:35.981 --> 06:37.399
That's why they call me a bulldog,

06:37.482 --> 06:39.901

how to fight back with a bully.

12:50.188 --> 12:51.356

12:52.941 --> 12:55.360
Well, you know, I told you about Jane's past.

12:56.027 --> 12:58.279
- That she was sexually assaulted.
- Right.

- Well, Jane is determined to confront him.

13:06.454 --> 13:09.415
So, Celeste made an appointment with him
next Wednesday,

13:09.540 --> 13:14.212

a little bit more my idea.

The man is dangerous. Right?

13:26.557 --> 13:30.186

and we're in a crowded office space.

13:36.275 --> 13:38.695
- Jane swore us to secrecy.
- All right.

and do that by herself.

13:42.407 --> 13:44.659
Madeline, this is a bad idea.

13:44.742 --> 13:48.830
Ed, she needs closure,
and I don't think I could stop her at this point.

Just say what you want to say, please.

- I don't believe you.

They're gonna hire a teacher's aide

28:58.030 --> 29:00.991
whose specific job
will be watching Ziggy and Amabella.

29:01.116 --> 29:03.410
Are you kidding me? That's ridiculous.

29:03.493 --> 29:05.037
Maybe not. I mean, what if she's right?

29:05.329 --> 29:07.414
I'm sorry, but Renata Klein cannot be right.

29:07.497 --> 29:09.499
Ziggy could be marked
with his dad's genetic stain.

29:09.625 --> 29:11.835
And if I did everything properly as a mother,
it wouldn't matter,

29:11.960 --> 29:13.295
and he wouldn't be behaving this way.

29:13.378 --> 29:15.589
I just feel like
you have such great instincts as a mom.

29:15.672 --> 29:17.966
Did you ever feel like something was off?

29:18.842 --> 29:22.220
When he was born, he didn't just
come out crying like most kids do.

29:23.180 --> 29:25.140
His whole body was shaking.

29:25.223 --> 29:27.726
It was like he was so upset to be born.

29:28.685 --> 29:30.896
And all I could do was look at him and say,

29:32.147 --> 29:34.566

29:35.025 --> 29:36.860

I always thought that seeing his little red face

29:45.827 --> 29:47.829
would wipe away
the dirty memory, you know? But...

29:47.913 --> 29:49.915

- Hey, Tom.

29:50.040 --> 29:51.083

29:51.208 --> 29:52.459

Was it just sex between us?
Of course it wasn't.

31:14.332 --> 31:17.294
But the other day, I started to feel afraid.

31:18.295 --> 31:21.006
And I've had this paralyzing fear

31:22.841 --> 31:25.010
that what happened between us
is gonna get out

31:25.135 --> 31:26.720

Better. I think we're all doing better.
How are you feeling?

31:47.824 --> 31:50.285
Actually, I normally have
a lot of lower back pain,

31:50.368 --> 31:52.829

a trip to the chiropractor.

I mean, I think that's a very healthy sign.

We never fight in front of them.
They never see anything. They're fine.

43:50.588 --> 43:53.466
They live in a happy household.
They have no idea.

43:54.926 --> 43:55.968
(EXHALING)

43:57.637 --> 43:59.138
- He will hit you again.
- Yeah.

43:59.222 --> 44:01.432
- Yeah.
- Yeah. And I'll hit him again.

44:01.933 --> 44:04.060
And, eventually, the boys will know.

44:04.143 --> 44:05.895
- No.
- If they already don't.

44:06.437 --> 44:07.814
(EXCLAIMING)

44:07.897 --> 44:09.398
All right, our time is about up.

44:10.107 --> 44:14.403
We should make an appointment
and come up with a plan.

44:16.072 --> 44:17.490
(SCOFFING) A plan?

44:18.241 --> 44:20.409
For the next time he hits you.

44:46.143 --> 44:47.436
Ms. Wright?

44:49.438 --> 44:51.440
Saxon Baker.

45:00.366 --> 45:01.450
Come on in.

45:12.879 --> 45:14.171
Have a seat.

45:17.550 --> 45:19.302
So, what are you looking for?

45:21.512 --> 45:23.306
It's a new project we're working on.

45:27.143 --> 45:28.644
Modern meets mid-century.

45:40.823 --> 45:42.491
Ms. Wright, this is very...

45:43.326 --> 45:44.368
Odd.
