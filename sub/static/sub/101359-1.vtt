00:49.799 --> 00:51.335
Don't you dare.

00:51.369 --> 00:53.170
Don't you dare!

00:53.204 --> 00:54.604
I think...

00:54.637 --> 00:56.706
Lily, I think you
need some water.

00:56.740 --> 00:57.540
Yes.

00:57.574 --> 00:58.908
Toilet?

01:02.812 --> 01:04.147
Thanks for that.

01:05.116 --> 01:06.984
You're welcome.

01:59.170 --> 02:02.106
Come on, onto the next
one, it's only 9 o'clock!

02:02.139 --> 02:03.840
Lily, would you get
in the back, please?

02:03.873 --> 02:07.244
Seeing as you asked so nicely.

02:13.050 --> 02:15.152
Yeah, mind the
face, I need that.

02:15.186 --> 02:16.020
Sorry!

02:17.955 --> 02:20.091
Such a graceful creature.

02:20.124 --> 02:21.092
Like a gazelle.

02:21.125 --> 02:22.126
Giving birth.

02:26.030 --> 02:27.664
Seatbelt on, fuck shite!

02:29.233 --> 02:31.435
I'm cold, can we
put the heating on?

02:31.469 --> 02:32.303
You're cold?

02:38.808 --> 02:40.010
Life begins at the end

02:40.044 --> 02:41.644
of your comfort zone, you know?

02:42.812 --> 02:43.981
So that's where I've
been going wrong.

02:44.014 --> 02:46.816
Look at me, heading
into the future.

02:46.850 --> 02:49.919
The unknown, marriage.

02:49.954 --> 02:50.753
Scary.

02:51.754 --> 02:53.157
I'm ready for it.

02:53.190 --> 02:54.824
Yeah, you look it.

02:54.858 --> 02:57.194
So glad you came.

02:57.228 --> 02:59.196
Lily said you'd
probably be busy but.

02:59.230 --> 03:01.132
Well it was just a once
in a lifetime moment,

03:01.165 --> 03:03.100
I just had to come, but
now I'm feeling a bit...

03:03.134 --> 03:04.734
She's still not coming?

03:05.902 --> 03:07.637
Still not part of
the bride tribe.

03:09.140 --> 03:10.274
What about FOMO?

03:10.307 --> 03:11.976
Not gonna miss out on much now,

03:12.009 --> 03:13.943
I mean we've already
been at it how long?

03:13.978 --> 03:15.179
Not long enough!

03:15.212 --> 03:16.813
Come on!

03:16.846 --> 03:18.249
You kids have fun.

03:18.282 --> 03:20.251
Just get changed, otherwise
you'll be missing out.

03:20.284 --> 03:21.118
On more puke?

03:21.152 --> 03:22.886
Yeah, I'm good thanks.

03:24.721 --> 03:28.125
Well, if you change your
mind, give us a call.

03:28.159 --> 03:28.993
Yeah.

03:31.928 --> 03:33.164
Come on!

03:35.299 --> 03:36.200
Let's get going!

03:39.336 --> 03:40.171
Oh yeah.

03:41.438 --> 03:42.473
Married.

03:42.506 --> 03:43.474
Could marry now.

03:44.441 --> 03:45.875
Nah, it's all right.

03:45.909 --> 03:47.710
Not you.

04:33.790 --> 04:35.059
What are you lot doing?

04:35.092 --> 04:36.327
Molotov cocktail.

04:37.228 --> 04:38.295
Here, have some.

04:38.329 --> 04:39.896
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

04:42.266 --> 04:44.401
I think my eyes are
bleeding from hay-fever.

04:49.607 --> 04:51.342
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

04:52.610 --> 04:55.012
Try not to burn the
whole place down.

04:55.980 --> 04:59.316
See, this is why we need you.

04:59.350 --> 05:01.085
I'd love to
see you wrecked.

05:01.118 --> 05:02.353
No you wouldn't.

05:02.386 --> 05:04.455
It's not pretty.

05:04.488 --> 05:06.889
Lily, don't do anything
I would, promise?

05:06.923 --> 05:07.757
Love you.

05:11.295 --> 05:12.529
Is she all right?

05:12.563 --> 05:15.599
Yeah, she can get proper
savage sometimes though.

05:15.633 --> 05:17.434
Something in her
brain just flips,

05:19.637 --> 05:21.238
so don't push it.

05:21.272 --> 05:22.473
You push it.

05:22.506 --> 05:26.010
Because I'm her little
sis, and that's my job.

06:01.944 --> 06:02.613
Good night?

06:04.615 --> 06:07.217
I'm never drinking with
your sister ever again.

06:07.251 --> 06:08.285
Please kill me.

06:08.319 --> 06:10.454
Cirrhosis will get
you first, I think.

06:11.255 --> 06:13.357
Got to see another
man's dick last night.

06:14.992 --> 06:17.394
Good for you, quite
the achievement.

06:17.428 --> 06:18.395
It was quite big.

06:19.463 --> 06:20.464
It was, yeah.

06:22.533 --> 06:23.534
Thanks for comin'.

06:24.368 --> 06:25.369
Pleasure.

06:26.670 --> 06:30.474
I would but if you squeeze
me, I might shit my pants.

06:31.442 --> 06:32.976
So classy, Claire.

06:35.079 --> 06:35.912
Fist?

06:36.613 --> 06:38.449
Love a bit of fisting.

06:38.482 --> 06:39.316
Fist bump.

06:41.952 --> 06:44.321
What time is your flight?

06:44.355 --> 06:45.656
9 p.m.

06:45.689 --> 06:47.591
Tell me again why we have to
get a shit o'clock flight?

06:47.624 --> 06:49.626
'Cause you lot don't
know any better.

06:49.660 --> 06:51.428
I hope I don't
throw up in the bus.

06:51.462 --> 06:52.463
Or on the bus.

06:52.496 --> 06:53.497
On my lap.

06:55.432 --> 06:56.700
See ya later.

06:56.734 --> 06:57.568
Safe journey.

06:57.601 --> 06:58.935
Yep, yep.

07:04.941 --> 07:06.043
Where are you goin'?

07:06.076 --> 07:07.444
Get some coffees.

07:07.478 --> 07:09.346
Bit awkward really,
it's like we've said

07:09.380 --> 07:11.115
goodbye but you're still there.

07:11.148 --> 07:12.383
Yeah, deal with it.

07:30.000 --> 07:30.734
Lily!

07:30.768 --> 07:33.303
I'm ready, I'm ready.

07:34.638 --> 07:38.008
My God, my head.

07:38.041 --> 07:39.009
Serves you right.

07:39.743 --> 07:41.378
It was worth it though.

07:41.412 --> 07:43.113
Was it though?

07:43.147 --> 07:45.649
Stop being a spoil sport.

07:45.682 --> 07:48.118
Did you have three
burgers last night?

07:51.188 --> 07:52.089
Might have done.

07:53.190 --> 07:54.691
Think they all
ended up on my top.

07:55.559 --> 07:56.926
Don't hate me.

07:59.029 --> 08:00.564
It was a bit tight anyway.

08:00.597 --> 08:01.999
You looked hot last night.

08:02.032 --> 08:02.666
Thanks.

08:02.699 --> 08:03.667
For a change.

08:05.702 --> 08:07.070
It's time to get a funk on,

08:07.104 --> 08:09.006
the others are long
gone, so drink up.

08:10.040 --> 08:10.707
This smells like arse.

08:10.741 --> 08:11.575
What?

08:16.313 --> 08:17.481
What the fuck is this?

08:17.514 --> 08:18.582
It's all they had.

08:21.051 --> 08:22.553
Tastes like rimming.

08:22.586 --> 08:24.087
How the fuck would you know?

08:25.456 --> 08:26.290
Fuck.

08:39.503 --> 08:40.770
I hope I don't get
charged for this mess.

08:40.804 --> 08:42.105
It's a hotel room,
what are they gonna do?

08:42.139 --> 08:44.073
Yeah, well you can pay for it.

08:44.107 --> 08:45.576
Just fucking live a little.

08:45.609 --> 08:47.544
Just fucking clean up a little.

08:47.578 --> 08:48.645
Lighten up!

08:49.746 --> 08:51.582
I took one for the team.

08:51.615 --> 08:53.417
I wanted Jess to
have a good hen do.

08:54.418 --> 08:56.286
Stop being a buzz kill.

08:56.320 --> 08:57.387
Yeah, well that was
yesterday, and now

08:57.421 --> 08:58.822
they fucked off and left, so.

08:58.856 --> 09:00.390
So what?

09:00.424 --> 09:02.493
So little sister, we
can get a move on.

09:13.070 --> 09:15.239
Hair of the dog, might help.

09:15.272 --> 09:16.240
Help?

09:16.273 --> 09:17.641
Dutch courage.

09:17.674 --> 09:18.842
No thanks.

09:18.876 --> 09:20.777
Did you even speak
to anyone last night?

09:20.811 --> 09:21.778
Suzie a bit.

09:23.313 --> 09:24.648
Forgot about Suzie.

09:25.516 --> 09:26.717
What are you so afraid of?

09:26.750 --> 09:28.519
My friends don't bite, you know.

09:30.354 --> 09:31.722
There's fun in there somewhere.

09:32.890 --> 09:34.391
Let your hair down
once in a while,

09:34.424 --> 09:36.093
release the boost
once in a while.

09:36.126 --> 09:37.528
Yeah, because that
went so well for me

09:37.561 --> 09:38.762
the last time that happened.

09:38.795 --> 09:40.163
Sorry.

09:40.197 --> 09:41.365
You know, I wish
you just wouldn't

09:41.398 --> 09:43.534
bring it up once,
just one fucking time.

09:43.567 --> 09:45.802
Just never seen you
like that before.

09:45.836 --> 09:47.871
Yeah, well it's not pretty.

09:47.905 --> 09:50.073
Bet it's fun to watch though.

09:50.107 --> 09:51.241
Have you seen the
state you're in?

10:09.560 --> 10:10.394
Boom.

10:11.862 --> 10:14.331
How the fuck are
we even related?

10:14.364 --> 10:15.232
Come on, just go.

10:17.334 --> 10:18.502
Yes capitan.

10:21.271 --> 10:22.172
What the fuck?

10:22.205 --> 10:24.408
I'm not leaving these behind.

10:24.441 --> 10:26.410
,
they don't give a shit.

10:26.443 --> 10:28.345
This stuff can clean drains.

10:30.614 --> 10:31.448
Wonderful.

10:35.285 --> 10:36.587
Pretty much how we found it.

10:50.801 --> 10:52.669
Can we get some
proper coffee, please?

10:52.703 --> 10:53.604
Are you trying to annoy me?

10:53.637 --> 10:55.739
No, just comes naturally.

10:57.341 --> 10:59.242
Oh, smoking more?

10:59.276 --> 11:01.645
No.

11:01.678 --> 11:03.480
You know you'll
get cancer and die.

11:03.513 --> 11:04.548
Everybody dies.

11:05.716 --> 11:06.583
Yeah.

11:08.285 --> 11:10.487
I'll fucking kill you
if you don't hurry up.

11:11.321 --> 11:12.623
There she is.

11:12.656 --> 11:14.591
Hulk smash.

11:14.625 --> 11:16.660
Claire, come on.

11:47.924 --> 11:48.892
Door's open.

11:50.661 --> 11:51.895
Door's open.

11:54.364 --> 11:55.465
Door's open.

11:55.499 --> 11:56.299
Coffee?

11:56.333 --> 11:56.968
Get in the car.

11:57.001 --> 11:57.934
Coffee.

11:57.969 --> 11:58.769
Get in the car, we'll get.

11:58.802 --> 11:59.803
What are you doing?

12:04.641 --> 12:06.843
Prefer to feel like
I'm being chauffeured.

12:06.877 --> 12:08.245
You're such a dick.

12:08.278 --> 12:09.646
Sister, you sound
like our mother.

12:09.680 --> 12:10.881
Yeah, God forbid someone
should parent you.

12:10.914 --> 12:12.916
I'm on fucking holiday.

12:12.949 --> 12:14.685
Drugs and alcohol.

12:14.718 --> 12:16.753
Why don't you ask your new
friend to take your home?

12:17.921 --> 12:18.789
Too old for me.

12:18.822 --> 12:21.391
More your type.

12:21.425 --> 12:23.794
No actually, not uptight enough.

12:23.827 --> 12:24.628
I'm not uptight.

12:24.661 --> 12:25.829
Yeah, of course not.

12:25.862 --> 12:28.398
Ah!

12:28.432 --> 12:29.766
There she is.

12:31.835 --> 12:33.236
Might need a new kneecap.

12:33.270 --> 12:33.937
It's not funny.

12:40.444 --> 12:41.378
See this?

12:42.913 --> 12:46.850
This is you, then boom.

12:49.720 --> 12:51.822
What are you so afraid of?

12:51.855 --> 12:53.490
Having a little fun?

12:53.523 --> 12:55.559
Being yourself for a change?

12:55.592 --> 12:56.860
You suppress the real
you for long enough,

12:56.893 --> 12:59.229
that shit is gonna give
you a brain aneurism.

13:00.764 --> 13:05.569
These seeds right here, they're
your seeds of greatness.

13:07.771 --> 13:09.372
Or destruction.

13:09.406 --> 13:10.307
Whatever.

13:12.809 --> 13:14.411
Don't suppress the seeds, Abby.

13:15.779 --> 13:16.613
Let them grow.

13:18.849 --> 13:19.750
Are you high?

13:23.320 --> 13:24.654
Sorry I don't always figure out

13:24.688 --> 13:26.556
into your selfish plans.

13:26.590 --> 13:27.791
I'm here, aren't I?

13:27.824 --> 13:28.725
Begrudgingly.

13:28.759 --> 13:29.726
You don't do anything anymore.

13:29.760 --> 13:31.428
That's not true.

13:31.461 --> 13:33.663
When was the last time you
did anything interesting?

13:39.936 --> 13:40.937
You're exhausting.

13:46.510 --> 13:47.811
It was a mistake, sorry.

13:49.346 --> 13:52.315
You should be.

13:52.349 --> 13:52.984
I am.

13:55.452 --> 13:57.721
Definitely deserves me a
coffee though, doesn't it?

13:59.823 --> 14:01.358
Love you.

14:01.391 --> 14:02.059
Yeah.

14:26.817 --> 14:28.385
What are you doing?

14:28.418 --> 14:30.955
Trying to load up the
videos from last night.

14:30.988 --> 14:32.656
Thanks for helping.

14:32.689 --> 14:33.523
Any time.

14:34.891 --> 14:36.027
What's the sat nav say?

14:36.060 --> 14:39.030
Sat nav says no.

14:39.063 --> 14:41.865
Shit on my face.

14:41.898 --> 14:42.899
How did that happen?

14:43.800 --> 14:44.935
Maybe after you puked on me,

14:44.969 --> 14:47.370
we had to drive back
from the bar last night.

14:48.139 --> 14:49.106
I see.

14:49.140 --> 14:51.042
Do not remember that one.

14:51.075 --> 14:52.576
Really?

14:52.609 --> 14:54.845
When you were crawling
all over the place.

14:54.878 --> 14:56.446
That was a mistake.

14:56.479 --> 14:57.948
Didn't help though, did it?

14:57.982 --> 14:58.748
You think.

15:01.785 --> 15:03.520
Use your phone.

15:03.553 --> 15:06.456
I mean I would, but there's
no fucking signal anywhere.

15:06.489 --> 15:08.125
Ah, fuck!

15:13.897 --> 15:16.499
It's just one straight road,

15:16.533 --> 15:17.767
from what I can remember.

15:20.104 --> 15:22.806
Well, get on that road then.

15:56.539 --> 15:58.942
I'm losing the
battle for wifi here.

15:58.976 --> 16:01.878
Don't worry, Bear Grylls, mate.

16:14.025 --> 16:15.892
Love you, pumpkin tits.

16:15.926 --> 16:17.827
Love you, donut nips.

16:23.200 --> 16:24.969
Did you film some of this?

16:25.002 --> 16:27.271
Yeah, obviously, until
you were sick on me.

16:27.305 --> 16:30.607
Ah, steady hand.

16:30.640 --> 16:32.442
So you did participate, sort of.

16:33.144 --> 16:35.279
Steady hands.

16:35.313 --> 16:36.579
Where's the night view?

16:36.613 --> 16:37.948
It's in the menu.

16:37.982 --> 16:39.516
The moon's a dead giveaway.

16:40.917 --> 16:41.751
Oh yeah.

16:42.919 --> 16:43.920
Oo.

16:44.888 --> 16:46.057
You look freaky.

16:47.058 --> 16:49.026
Tell us what's happening.

16:50.328 --> 16:51.594
I'm looking at a map, so we can

16:51.628 --> 16:52.997
get back to the
airport, because someone

16:53.030 --> 16:54.931
broke our fucking sat
nav, and there's no

16:54.966 --> 16:56.300
phone signal anywhere.

16:56.334 --> 16:58.802
Or maybe you're a cheapskate,

16:58.835 --> 17:00.603
and you've run out
of data and credit.

17:02.006 --> 17:04.641
Tell me, why are we even here?

17:04.674 --> 17:06.077
Something about your friend Jess

17:06.109 --> 17:09.546
wanting a cheap hen
do, like dirt cheap.

17:09.579 --> 17:10.847
Love you Jess.

17:10.880 --> 17:13.817
Or maybe your insistence
on a rental car,

17:13.849 --> 17:15.086
instead of public transport.

17:16.786 --> 17:18.655
They're probably home by now.

17:18.688 --> 17:21.058
Yeah probably, assuming
their plane didn't crash.

17:22.625 --> 17:23.294
Shit.

17:24.627 --> 17:25.627
Time to go.

18:52.849 --> 18:55.752
Are we going to
make this flight?

19:13.471 --> 19:14.637
I hope so.

19:31.188 --> 19:33.623
Still no signal anywhere.

19:45.202 --> 19:46.470
What was that?

19:46.504 --> 19:47.304
Fuck.

19:47.338 --> 19:48.172
What?

19:50.740 --> 19:52.042
Flat tire.

20:00.817 --> 20:02.086
Is it fucked?

20:04.522 --> 20:06.357
Pretty fucked, yeah.

20:09.527 --> 20:11.228
Are we gonna miss the flight?

20:11.262 --> 20:13.130
I don't know, I just wanna get

20:13.164 --> 20:15.166
this sorted so we can get going.

20:18.269 --> 20:19.836
Does your phone have any signal?

20:22.973 --> 20:23.806
No.

20:24.874 --> 20:25.708
Shit.

20:28.445 --> 20:31.282
Fuck this country and
it's shitty signal.

20:32.483 --> 20:33.317
Yeah.

20:50.534 --> 20:51.502
What?

20:53.103 --> 20:56.207
I just wanted to see if
you needed any help at all.

20:58.976 --> 21:00.477
Not at the moment, thank you.

21:07.384 --> 21:09.286
You ever changed a tire before?

21:10.221 --> 21:11.288
No, you?

21:14.124 --> 21:15.526
Nope.

21:15.559 --> 21:16.393
Okay.

21:18.828 --> 21:21.498
Well that tire
looks all right to me.

21:21.532 --> 21:24.134
Tires aren't supposed
to hiss, dick brain.

21:24.168 --> 21:26.437
I'd rather not
fuck my insurance.

21:26.470 --> 21:29.206
Maybe we could flag
down another car.

21:29.240 --> 21:31.475
Yeah, well if you
see one, let me know.

21:34.378 --> 21:35.212
Yeah.

21:45.289 --> 21:47.157
I'll point it this way.

21:51.061 --> 21:52.496
That'll do, that'll do.

21:52.529 --> 21:53.297
- That'll do.
- Yeah?

21:53.330 --> 21:54.398
Yeah, yeah.

21:57.635 --> 21:59.236
Righty tighty, lefty loosey.

22:04.241 --> 22:06.477
This is gonna need some Hulk.

22:11.482 --> 22:13.384
You're good with nuts.

22:13.417 --> 22:14.884
Yes, I've been told.

22:14.917 --> 22:16.186
Anymore?

22:16.220 --> 22:17.554
No, no, no, carry on.

22:17.588 --> 22:18.555
Yeah will do.

22:21.158 --> 22:21.992
There you go.

22:22.026 --> 22:23.926
You can hold the nuts.

22:23.961 --> 22:24.794
Oo!

22:29.066 --> 22:29.899
Okay.

22:33.504 --> 22:35.205
Oh fuck.

22:35.239 --> 22:36.073
What?

22:37.174 --> 22:38.875
The spare's fucking
flat as well.

22:40.277 --> 22:41.911
I mean, I can put it on for now,

22:41.944 --> 22:43.380
but we can't drive it anywhere.

22:43.414 --> 22:45.316
Oh fuck off.

22:45.349 --> 22:46.517
Can't we pump it up?

22:46.550 --> 22:49.019
Yeah, have you got
a spare pump on you?

22:49.053 --> 22:49.852
No.

22:49.886 --> 22:50.521
Yeah, well me neither.

22:52.589 --> 22:54.158
Don't get angry.

22:54.191 --> 22:56.327
I'm not.

22:56.360 --> 22:57.894
It's no one's fault.

22:57.927 --> 22:59.330
Yeah, it's just unfortunate.

23:03.900 --> 23:06.537
Is now a bad time to say that

23:06.570 --> 23:10.274
I'm desperate for a piss?

23:11.408 --> 23:12.376
Probably, yeah.

23:25.622 --> 23:27.424
We can't just sit
here all night.

23:34.431 --> 23:35.332
We should go up the
road for 10 minutes

23:35.366 --> 23:36.500
and see if we can find anything.

23:39.203 --> 23:40.304
Anything on the map?

23:41.938 --> 23:44.108
Nothing obvious, but it's better

23:44.141 --> 23:46.643
than just sitting here, we
might find some phone signal.

23:48.412 --> 23:50.147
Yeah.

23:50.180 --> 23:55.185
Let's do it.

24:04.094 --> 24:06.163
You left the lights on.

24:06.196 --> 24:08.465
Don't worry, the
turn themselves off.

24:08.499 --> 24:09.500
Is our car possessed?

24:09.533 --> 24:11.735
Yeah, just like.

24:11.769 --> 24:14.438
What if we don't find
anything, or anyone?

24:15.272 --> 24:17.374
Ask yourself, what
would our mother do?

24:17.408 --> 24:19.109
Or father.

24:19.143 --> 24:20.577
Find someway to blame me.

24:20.611 --> 24:22.413
Yeah, he would actually.

24:22.446 --> 24:26.450
Well, best to think
positive in times like this.

24:26.483 --> 24:28.519
I think we might get raped.

24:28.552 --> 24:29.720
Or murdered.

24:29.753 --> 24:32.423
Or murdered then
raped, then buried,

24:32.456 --> 24:35.192
then exhumed, then raped again.

24:35.225 --> 24:37.728
So much rape.

24:37.761 --> 24:39.530
Hear about stories all the time.

24:40.431 --> 24:43.333
Alien anal, probing.

24:45.636 --> 24:48.272
That is also a very
distinct possibility.

24:48.305 --> 24:51.141
Yeah it is, and it's not
something to joke about.

24:51.175 --> 24:52.009
Oo!

24:53.444 --> 24:55.612
Not to worry, I have
the Hulk on my side.

24:55.646 --> 24:57.981
Stop calling me
the fucking Hulk.

24:58.015 --> 24:59.450
Watch out.

24:59.483 --> 25:00.984
I think someone's going green.

25:03.420 --> 25:05.556
I think the point
is never really

25:05.589 --> 25:07.458
know who you are,
until you're put

25:07.491 --> 25:09.092
in a situation like this.

25:10.294 --> 25:11.562
High stress.

25:12.396 --> 25:13.363
Unpredictable.

25:14.498 --> 25:16.567
Possibly dangerous.

25:16.600 --> 25:19.403
Yep, and we all know you're
someone that talks too much.

25:19.436 --> 25:21.472
Someone who lightens the mood,

25:21.505 --> 25:25.108
who laughs in the
face of danger.

25:25.142 --> 25:26.009
Funny.

25:26.710 --> 25:28.345
It's not the vibe I'm getting.

25:31.415 --> 25:33.150
I'd rather keep
talking actually.

25:34.551 --> 25:37.221
Anything to take my mind
off this fucking scary road.

25:53.170 --> 25:53.972
Lily!

26:10.187 --> 26:11.555
Go, go on.

26:32.242 --> 26:33.076
Shit.

26:47.524 --> 26:48.892
There's nothing there.

26:48.926 --> 26:52.863
Well close it, they
could be back any second.

26:55.632 --> 26:57.200
At least we're not
the only car stuck,

26:57.234 --> 26:59.836
I mean if they've
gone to get help then.

26:59.870 --> 27:00.871
Then what?

27:07.277 --> 27:09.179
I can't see anything.

27:10.914 --> 27:14.718
They could have been gone
for hours, days even.

27:16.219 --> 27:18.589
Yeah, we'll never know.

27:32.836 --> 27:34.671
What is it?

27:34.705 --> 27:36.139
I don't know.

27:37.407 --> 27:39.242
Don't touch it.

27:39.276 --> 27:41.445
I wasn't gonna touch it.

27:42.746 --> 27:46.183
Poke it with a
stick or something.

27:46.216 --> 27:47.851
You should be a scientist.

27:55.826 --> 27:57.160
Well?

28:00.697 --> 28:01.932
We should get back to the car.

28:01.966 --> 28:03.467
At least it's warm in there.

28:03.500 --> 28:04.334
Yeah.

28:17.881 --> 28:19.216
I'm fucking starving.

28:20.018 --> 28:20.851
Want some?

28:20.884 --> 28:21.885
No thanks.

28:32.562 --> 28:33.864
Oh my God.

28:33.897 --> 28:35.465
That good then?

28:36.633 --> 28:38.268
It tastes like Ebola.

28:40.370 --> 28:42.339
Oh it's fucking horrid.

28:42.372 --> 28:43.774
Wash it down with
some of your Eastern

28:43.807 --> 28:45.909
European moonshine then.

28:45.942 --> 28:46.777
Will do.

29:02.026 --> 29:04.294
It has a fresh taste.

29:04.327 --> 29:05.829
Like communism.

29:05.862 --> 29:07.431
Yep.

29:07.464 --> 29:08.298
Nice.

29:17.674 --> 29:19.476
I really need a wee.

29:25.549 --> 29:26.383
I'll hold it.

29:30.487 --> 29:31.321
What now?

29:36.393 --> 29:37.661
I don't know.

29:45.103 --> 29:47.071
Do you think it was one of those

29:47.105 --> 29:49.606
spiky ball things
that got in the tire?

29:53.044 --> 29:54.311
I don't know, maybe.

29:58.749 --> 30:01.418
Maybe those people went
to go find somebody.

30:04.354 --> 30:05.322
Yeah, the car didn't look like

30:05.355 --> 30:06.523
it had been there long.

30:09.626 --> 30:11.062
Short of walking
down a dark road

30:11.095 --> 30:13.965
in the middle of the
night, I'm out of ideas.

30:16.867 --> 30:17.734
I'd rather not.

30:19.503 --> 30:21.038
I'll definitely miss the flight.

30:25.842 --> 30:29.080
I don't mind, as
long as you're okay.

30:34.986 --> 30:35.786
Hey you.

31:00.777 --> 31:01.578
What?

31:01.611 --> 31:02.846
What?

31:02.879 --> 31:03.713
What?

31:05.649 --> 31:06.483
I wanna know.

31:07.185 --> 31:08.885
You wanna know what?

31:08.919 --> 31:11.454
What happened when you.

31:12.823 --> 31:13.824
Lost it.

31:16.160 --> 31:17.061
Was it scary?

31:19.729 --> 31:21.065
It was the most
scared I've ever been.

31:22.732 --> 31:23.934
More than now?

31:25.669 --> 31:26.570
Yeah I'd say so.

31:29.940 --> 31:31.708
Did you just go bat shit?

31:33.510 --> 31:34.945
It didn't come out of nowhere.

31:36.113 --> 31:37.514
It was more than that.

31:40.218 --> 31:44.387
It was like being
taken over by it,

31:45.488 --> 31:46.723
being possessed by it.

31:48.758 --> 31:50.927
I almost had no control.

31:50.962 --> 31:54.598
Almost, but the guy
did provoke you.

31:54.631 --> 31:56.968
Guys, plural.

32:00.470 --> 32:05.475
Dorm room, drunk, class A,
and you can guess the rest.

32:12.616 --> 32:14.451
They were grabbing
at my friend Lynn.

32:17.088 --> 32:20.657
Things got a bit
heated, bit out of hand.

32:25.862 --> 32:30.600
One of them grabbed
me, and pinned me down.

32:34.604 --> 32:39.210
I couldn't breathe.

32:39.243 --> 32:41.078
And Lynn was asking
them to stop,

32:41.112 --> 32:44.547
she kept saying "It's
not funny anymore."

32:48.718 --> 32:50.553
And then one of them
locked the door,

32:55.226 --> 32:58.695
and as soon as I heard that
latch click, I just lost it.

33:07.104 --> 33:07.938
Shit.

33:11.775 --> 33:13.510
I kicked and
screamed my way out,

33:16.713 --> 33:18.149
I've never been the same since.

33:19.883 --> 33:20.985
Never talked about it.

33:22.053 --> 33:24.956
Haven't seen Lynn, haven't
seen the guys, just all gone.

33:28.692 --> 33:33.697
Just lucky you did what
you did, when you did.

33:35.632 --> 33:36.566
I almost gave up.

33:41.172 --> 33:44.641
I didn't think I had
the stomach for it.

33:47.711 --> 33:49.779
I just felt so powerless.

33:52.016 --> 33:56.553
But then Hulk smash.

34:00.358 --> 34:01.192
Exactly.

34:08.665 --> 34:11.135
Seeds of greatness right there.

34:19.943 --> 34:21.610
I mean, if I hadn't
gotten myself

34:21.643 --> 34:23.880
into that situation,
then I wouldn't have

34:23.913 --> 34:26.850
it etched in my
memory, but I learnt

34:28.818 --> 34:30.786
a few things that night.

34:30.820 --> 34:32.856
My sister is a proper badass.

35:18.269 --> 35:19.103
Lily?

35:38.922 --> 35:39.756
Lily?

35:48.432 --> 35:49.266
Lily?

35:56.873 --> 35:58.808
Lily, where you at?

36:36.981 --> 36:39.649
Fine, be a dick.

37:37.874 --> 37:38.708
Lily?

39:00.090 --> 39:00.923
Shit.

39:02.393 --> 39:03.227
Lily?

39:05.462 --> 39:06.297
Hello?

39:07.398 --> 39:08.232
Lily?

39:48.105 --> 39:48.938
Hello?

39:50.007 --> 39:50.840
Lily?

40:54.238 --> 40:55.038
Lily?

40:58.542 --> 41:02.246
Keep talking, keep
talking, I'm near.

41:18.495 --> 41:20.230
What happened to you?

41:22.566 --> 41:23.400
Please.

41:24.435 --> 41:25.669
Please help me.

41:30.274 --> 41:31.108
Please.

42:29.166 --> 42:30.234
It's okay.

42:30.267 --> 42:32.369
I'm here to help, okay?

42:39.743 --> 42:41.712
Do you speak English?

42:41.745 --> 42:44.748
Yeah.

42:44.781 --> 42:46.550
What's your name?

42:46.583 --> 42:47.417
Hannah.

42:48.785 --> 42:50.587
I'm Abby.

43:09.873 --> 43:12.242
Please, we need to go.

43:12.276 --> 43:14.578
Let me help you, please.

43:21.852 --> 43:23.353
Let me help you.

43:42.806 --> 43:43.807
Here you go.

44:19.209 --> 44:20.577
I have a sister,
have you seen her?

44:20.611 --> 44:21.578
I just...

44:21.612 --> 44:24.548
I don't know, just be quick.

44:38.795 --> 44:41.331
How did this happen?

44:41.365 --> 44:43.266
Just please, just wrap it up,

44:43.300 --> 44:47.638
we need to go, then I'll
explain everything, please.

44:49.439 --> 44:50.273
Tighter.

45:01.718 --> 45:02.853
Another.

45:42.026 --> 45:43.694
It's this way.

45:43.727 --> 45:45.796
It's even higher.

46:01.778 --> 46:03.047
Tell me what happened to you.

46:03.081 --> 46:04.815
Give me your phone.

46:05.849 --> 46:06.850
No signal.

46:15.559 --> 46:16.393
Hey!

46:17.761 --> 46:19.663
Where do you think you're going?

46:19.696 --> 46:20.530
No, no!

46:21.798 --> 46:24.801
You're not going anywhere
until we find my sister.

46:24.835 --> 46:27.038
Please, it isn't safe.

46:27.071 --> 46:28.472
We have to go.

46:34.344 --> 46:35.545
We need to go!

46:35.579 --> 46:37.347
We need to go, we need to go.

46:37.380 --> 46:38.749
We need to go, we need to go.

46:38.782 --> 46:41.718
Hannah!

46:44.387 --> 46:45.957
What happened to you?

46:48.759 --> 46:50.627
Was it an animal?

46:52.130 --> 46:54.765
What did this to you?

46:58.468 --> 47:00.004
Hannah, I can't find my sister,

47:01.105 --> 47:02.372
and now I found you.

47:05.375 --> 47:06.777
I need your help.

47:12.415 --> 47:13.583
Are you alone?

47:15.519 --> 47:16.353
No.

47:18.156 --> 47:19.790
Peter.

47:19.823 --> 47:20.924
Who's Peter?

47:20.958 --> 47:21.792
Where's Peter?

47:23.794 --> 47:24.694
Back there.

47:28.398 --> 47:29.900
Could he be in trouble?

47:30.934 --> 47:32.435
Could my sister be there?

47:41.878 --> 47:42.712
Show me.

48:19.683 --> 48:20.517
Well?

48:21.986 --> 48:24.121
Peter opened the car
door to get some air.

48:26.523 --> 48:28.592
He thought he heard crying.

48:28.625 --> 48:29.459
Crying?

48:30.228 --> 48:31.361
Yeah.

48:33.597 --> 48:36.000
And then he disappeared
into the darkness,

48:36.033 --> 48:39.003
and all I heard next
were his screams.

48:39.036 --> 48:41.738
I didn't run to help, I
didn't know what to do.

48:42.974 --> 48:45.977
He kept shouting,
I had to find him,

48:46.010 --> 48:49.981
but then I saw something.

48:51.615 --> 48:54.918
I didn't know what it was,
I just turned and ran.

48:55.752 --> 48:57.921
I tripped, this is
as far as I've come.

49:00.091 --> 49:01.658
Shit!

49:01.691 --> 49:02.592
One second.

58:57.721 --> 58:59.756
Help, somebody help us!

59:03.227 --> 59:04.061
Abby?

59:05.863 --> 59:06.830
Abby.

59:06.864 --> 59:08.098
Shh!

59:20.110 --> 59:21.778
How did you find us?

59:27.518 --> 59:29.086
What is that thing?

59:30.254 --> 59:33.624
I don't know, we
just need to go.

59:33.657 --> 59:35.526
Keep tight to me, all right.

59:35.559 --> 59:37.060
Everything else.

59:41.431 --> 59:43.133
Where are we?

59:43.166 --> 59:44.535
In a cabin.

59:46.169 --> 59:48.405
Hannah, can you move Peter?

59:48.438 --> 59:50.474
He's badly injured.

59:50.507 --> 59:52.109
Please don't leave us in here.

59:53.243 --> 59:54.511
Help me.

59:54.545 --> 59:55.812
Help us.

01:00:00.517 --> 01:00:02.352
Hannah, do you have a belt?

01:00:02.386 --> 01:00:03.487
Yeah.

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.669
Okay Peter, we're gonna need you

01:00:18.702 --> 01:00:20.804
to move yourself, okay?

01:00:20.837 --> 01:00:22.439
I can't carry you.

01:00:22.472 --> 01:00:24.107
None of us can carry you.

01:00:25.943 --> 01:00:27.210
I tried to blind it.

01:00:28.211 --> 01:00:29.446
The light hurts it.

01:00:29.479 --> 01:00:31.348
I know, I saw, you
were really brave,

01:00:32.449 --> 01:00:33.517
but the light also
gave away our position.

01:00:34.384 --> 01:00:35.586
I'm stupid.

01:00:35.619 --> 01:00:38.155
It was me who got us
lost on that road.

01:00:38.188 --> 01:00:42.559
Peter, I don't care, let's
just get out of here, please.

01:00:42.593 --> 01:00:44.394
Help me up.

01:00:44.428 --> 01:00:45.696
Use the wall.

01:00:45.729 --> 01:00:47.464
Lily, take my hand.

01:00:52.502 --> 01:00:53.604
Hannah, take Lily's.

01:00:53.637 --> 01:00:55.639
I'm gonna lead you out of here.

01:00:55.672 --> 01:00:56.840
Okay go.

01:01:09.753 --> 01:01:10.587
This way.

01:01:34.811 --> 01:01:37.280
It's coming back.

01:02:28.632 --> 01:02:29.800
Please, Peter!

01:02:31.002 --> 01:02:33.236
Just go, please.

01:02:33.270 --> 01:02:36.306
I can't, not this
time, I'm sorry.

01:02:36.339 --> 01:02:37.674
Please stand up.

01:02:37.708 --> 01:02:38.842
We go together.

01:02:38.875 --> 01:02:40.811
Peter, we
need to go now, okay?

01:02:40.844 --> 01:02:42.446
I can't, I can't.

01:02:42.479 --> 01:02:45.649
Any second that thing's
gonna turn back around.

01:02:45.682 --> 01:02:47.718
And I'll be here to face it.

01:02:47.751 --> 01:02:49.786
No, no, no, no, no, no!

01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:50.787
Peter.

01:02:50.821 --> 01:02:52.289
Peter, get up!

01:02:52.322 --> 01:02:53.557
I'm sorry.

01:02:53.590 --> 01:02:55.625
Not this time, I'm sorry.

01:02:55.659 --> 01:02:56.660
Save yourself.

01:02:56.693 --> 01:02:58.528
Please, my love, please.

01:02:58.562 --> 01:02:59.896
I can't.

01:02:59.930 --> 01:03:01.966
Just go, please.

01:03:01.999 --> 01:03:03.834
I can't leave you again.

01:03:03.867 --> 01:03:06.003
Yes you can, okay?

01:03:06.037 --> 01:03:06.837
You can.

01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:08.438
You can get help.

01:03:08.472 --> 01:03:11.708
These people will
help you, okay?

01:03:11.742 --> 01:03:12.709
Go with them.

01:03:12.743 --> 01:03:13.710
Be safe.

01:03:13.744 --> 01:03:14.845
I can't leave you.

01:03:14.878 --> 01:03:17.714
Yes you can, just go, just go!

01:03:19.916 --> 01:03:20.784
Go!

01:03:20.817 --> 01:03:21.718
Peter.

01:03:21.752 --> 01:03:22.753
Hide.

01:03:22.786 --> 01:03:23.887
Hannah, hide!

01:03:28.092 --> 01:03:29.893
Peter, no!

01:04:10.534 --> 01:04:11.969
Lily, don't look.

01:04:13.403 --> 01:04:14.805
It's coming.

01:04:14.838 --> 01:04:16.107
No, no, no, no!

01:04:18.642 --> 01:04:19.810
Abby!

01:04:51.942 --> 01:04:52.843
Listen to me, you're gonna run

01:04:52.876 --> 01:04:55.545
as fast as you can and
not look back, okay?

01:04:55.579 --> 01:04:56.847
What about you?

01:04:58.182 --> 01:05:01.852
I promised I'd look
after you, didn't I?

01:05:01.885 --> 01:05:04.921
Yeah, it's my fault we're here.

01:05:04.956 --> 01:05:06.523
It was my mistake.

01:05:06.556 --> 01:05:08.592
This isn't your fault, Abby.

01:05:08.625 --> 01:05:10.061
None of it is.

01:05:10.094 --> 01:05:13.830
If it wasn't for me, you'd
be home already, be safe.

01:05:13.864 --> 01:05:16.733
You'd be on a different
plane with your friends,

01:05:16.766 --> 01:05:18.401
not stuck out with
your boring sister.

01:05:21.538 --> 01:05:24.374
If we do this together,
we'll be okay.

01:05:26.010 --> 01:05:26.910
Molotov cocktail?

01:05:28.712 --> 01:05:30.947
I knew you were a loony.

01:05:33.550 --> 01:05:34.384
Ready?

01:05:35.819 --> 01:05:36.786
Yeah.

01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:37.654
Good.

01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:40.824
We'll make it quick.

01:05:42.126 --> 01:05:42.960
Hey!

01:05:44.128 --> 01:05:45.062
Hey!

01:05:46.197 --> 01:05:47.031
This way!

01:05:48.565 --> 01:05:49.399
Lily wait.

01:05:52.203 --> 01:05:53.037
This way!

01:05:58.009 --> 01:05:58.808
Okay go.

01:06:06.050 --> 01:06:06.883
Please work.

01:06:25.069 --> 01:06:27.504
Fuck, fuck.

01:06:27.537 --> 01:06:29.906
Try not to burn the
whole place down.

01:06:32.310 --> 01:06:35.146
See, this is why
we need you though.

01:06:35.179 --> 01:06:36.147
I'd love to
see you wrecked.

01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:37.814
No you wouldn't.

01:06:40.017 --> 01:06:43.820
Lily, don't do anything
I would, promise?

01:06:55.799 --> 01:06:56.700
Hey, hey.

01:06:57.969 --> 01:06:58.935
Come here.

01:07:05.209 --> 01:07:06.043
Come on you fuck.

01:07:56.693 --> 01:07:57.660
Come on, we have to move.

01:07:57.694 --> 01:07:59.829
I'm going as fast I can.

01:07:59.863 --> 01:08:01.165
Are you okay?

01:08:01.198 --> 01:08:02.366
Fine.

01:08:04.969 --> 01:08:06.303
What's that sound?

01:08:14.811 --> 01:08:16.080
We have to go.

01:08:16.113 --> 01:08:17.048
What's that sound?

01:08:17.081 --> 01:08:17.913
Now!

01:09:02.826 --> 01:09:04.127
Take these and go.

01:09:04.161 --> 01:09:05.129
What?

01:09:05.162 --> 01:09:06.063
Go!

01:09:06.096 --> 01:09:07.298
Where are you going?

01:09:07.331 --> 01:09:09.066
Go to the car, lock
yourself inside

01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:11.335
and keep the lights off.

01:10:57.241 --> 01:10:58.209
Oh my God.

01:11:25.035 --> 01:11:26.971
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

01:11:33.043 --> 01:11:34.877
They put them there.

01:11:43.287 --> 01:11:44.921
What do we do now?

01:11:48.525 --> 01:11:50.261
No idea.

01:12:42.498 --> 01:12:46.127
