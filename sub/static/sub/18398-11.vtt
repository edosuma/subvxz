WEBVTT

00:00.040 --> 00:02.023
This is what happened
last time on Star...

00:02.025 --> 00:04.148
I signed you all up
as a four-girl group.

00:04.151 --> 00:05.650
So you can't perform without me.

00:05.653 --> 00:08.763
Big Trouble!

00:10.167 --> 00:11.533
Jahil and Eva,

00:11.568 --> 00:13.301
they've been playing us this whole time.

00:13.336 --> 00:16.404
I need my outsides to match my insides.

00:16.440 --> 00:20.019
Why would you pay somebody
to mutilate what God gave you?

00:20.042 --> 00:21.209
You mama's bitch!

00:21.244 --> 00:22.911
I just bought us a house.

00:22.946 --> 00:25.046
Nobody's ever been this nice to me.

00:26.041 --> 00:27.541
Stop! That's your son.

00:28.070 --> 00:30.018
You said my daddy was dead.

00:30.053 --> 00:31.719
Why would you take that chance?

00:31.755 --> 00:33.655
Because I love you.

00:40.931 --> 00:42.997
The moment a child is born,

00:43.033 --> 00:45.366
you never stop worrying.

00:45.402 --> 00:48.870
But here's the crazy part, Lord.

00:48.905 --> 00:53.007
The worst thing that'll ever
happen to that child is you.

00:57.347 --> 01:00.248
You could've told me.

01:00.283 --> 01:02.016
Why you whispering?

01:02.052 --> 01:05.687
She got enough drugs in her
system to knock out a horse.

01:07.190 --> 01:09.824
Why didn't you tell me, Carlotta?

01:11.862 --> 01:15.697
Honestly, I wasn't even
thinking about you at all.

01:15.732 --> 01:18.002
I was thinking about
what was best for my baby.

01:18.535 --> 01:20.234
And what was best for your baby

01:20.237 --> 01:22.370
was telling her she ain't got no father?

01:22.405 --> 01:25.607
I could've helped, Lottie.

01:25.642 --> 01:27.909
Okay, let me wrap my head around this.

01:27.944 --> 01:30.050
You were gonna take her

01:30.089 --> 01:32.814
when I got locked up?

01:35.485 --> 01:37.919
I don't know.

01:37.954 --> 01:39.954
Exactly.

01:44.818 --> 01:49.364
See, that's what got me
knocked up in the first place.

01:51.668 --> 01:54.068
That smooth talk.

01:54.104 --> 01:56.638
That Peruvian smirk.

01:56.673 --> 01:58.740
That dirt weed.

01:58.775 --> 02:01.209
Well, fair enough.

02:01.876 --> 02:03.745
You're here for Alexandra Crane?

02:03.747 --> 02:06.161
- Yes. Yes, and Derek Jones.
- Mr. Jones is being treated

02:06.200 --> 02:07.649
for multiple injuries.

02:07.684 --> 02:09.217
Alex?

02:09.252 --> 02:11.986
She's being seen by the doctor
now, but we'll keep you posted.

02:13.757 --> 02:15.523
Uh, w-wait, ma'am.

02:15.559 --> 02:17.926
We've been posted. What
you think we been doing?

02:17.961 --> 02:20.828
Oh, my God.

02:23.466 --> 02:26.267
So? How's Hunter?

02:30.073 --> 02:33.274
Actually, I've been meaning
to talk to you about him.

02:38.114 --> 02:40.081
He bought us a house.

02:40.116 --> 02:43.451
"Us"? Who's "us"?

02:43.486 --> 02:46.454
Me and him.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.266
I know.

02:49.303 --> 02:51.960
He just thinks we need
some privacy from his mother

02:51.995 --> 02:54.662
so we can figure out
if this thing is real,

02:54.698 --> 02:56.331
if it's gonna work.

02:56.366 --> 02:58.700
Do you love him?

03:01.805 --> 03:03.638
I think so.

03:03.673 --> 03:06.241
Okay, but do you actually love him,

03:06.276 --> 03:09.143
or is it the whole famous-
football-player thing?

03:09.179 --> 03:11.613
That's why I wanted him.

03:11.648 --> 03:13.615
- Who don't want a ballplayer?
- Me.

03:13.650 --> 03:15.683
I would've gone for a rapper.

03:17.000 --> 03:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:24.160 --> 03:27.996
No, but I think he... I
think he really gets me.

03:30.267 --> 03:33.167
He does love me.

03:33.203 --> 03:35.637
He also kind of needs me.

03:35.672 --> 03:39.814
Fine, as long as he's nice to you.

03:39.853 --> 03:42.839
He is. Very nice.

03:46.216 --> 03:48.182
When Cotton was a little boy,

03:48.218 --> 03:50.251
he sat next to me.

03:50.287 --> 03:53.321
He said, "Mama, how do I look?"

03:53.356 --> 03:57.825
I said, "You look handsome, Arnold."

03:57.861 --> 04:02.463
He said, "No, Mama. I look pretty."

04:02.499 --> 04:05.900
I said, "No. Boys are handsome."

04:07.737 --> 04:10.705
He said, "Why won't
you tell me I'm pretty?

04:10.740 --> 04:13.574
I want to be pretty, Mama, please."

04:22.531 --> 04:24.211
That was it, man.

04:33.396 --> 04:35.697
You are lucky to be alive, young lady.

04:35.732 --> 04:37.080
Where's Derek? How is he?

04:37.083 --> 04:38.612
That they were able to pry open that car

04:38.614 --> 04:39.834
and you walk away without a scratch

04:39.836 --> 04:41.035
is incomprehensible.

04:41.071 --> 04:42.136
Where is my boyfriend?

04:42.172 --> 04:43.705
I want to see him. Is he okay?

04:45.241 --> 04:48.042
We don't know yet.
He's still in the ICU.

04:48.078 --> 04:50.044
- ICU... where is that?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:50.080 --> 04:53.181
Relax, relax. He's in good hands.

04:53.216 --> 04:55.049
Thank you.

04:57.920 --> 05:00.288
Maybe you're already aware of this.

05:00.323 --> 05:01.923
Aware of what?

05:01.958 --> 05:04.425
You're pregnant.

05:19.849 --> 05:24.344
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

05:24.347 --> 05:25.580
Is he okay?

05:25.615 --> 05:26.881
He's in a medically induced coma

05:26.883 --> 05:28.149
to decrease the swelling in his brain.

05:28.151 --> 05:29.306
Please, I need to see him.

05:29.309 --> 05:30.485
- Please.
- I'm sorry.

05:30.520 --> 05:32.634
You'll have to come back
tomorrow during visiting hours.

05:32.636 --> 05:33.602
Are you family?

05:33.605 --> 05:35.723
I'm carrying his baby.

05:35.759 --> 05:38.159
Baby?! You're pregnant?!

05:40.182 --> 05:42.363
Don't worry about it.
What are you doing here?

05:42.399 --> 05:44.966
Don't worry about it?
Listen to yourself.

05:45.001 --> 05:47.368
Now, I'll find an
excellent local doctor,

05:47.404 --> 05:48.536
and I'll make an appointment for you

05:48.538 --> 05:49.771
first thing tomorrow morning.

05:49.806 --> 05:50.838
For what?

05:50.874 --> 05:52.340
What do you mean for what?

05:52.375 --> 05:53.474
You're having an abortion.

05:53.510 --> 05:55.476
This is my decision.

05:55.512 --> 05:57.311
Decision?

05:57.347 --> 06:00.047
Obviously, you can't have
a baby at 19 years old.

06:00.083 --> 06:01.482
How are you going to live?

06:01.518 --> 06:03.326
The boy works in a hardware store.

06:03.356 --> 06:06.085
It's called Avalon Shipping.
It's a shipping company.

06:09.359 --> 06:10.691
How is he?

06:10.727 --> 06:11.959
I'm finding out now.

06:11.995 --> 06:13.761
You need to go back to the hotel.

06:13.797 --> 06:15.563
I can handle Derek. I'm
a big girl, all right?

06:15.565 --> 06:16.831
No, Alexandra!

06:16.866 --> 06:18.666
Mom, you need to go
back to the hotel now!

06:18.701 --> 06:20.935
Look, I'll call you when I've
found out more about Derek.

06:20.937 --> 06:23.037
Just don't worry, okay?

06:23.072 --> 06:25.606
I love you.

06:25.642 --> 06:27.108
Condoms.

06:27.143 --> 06:30.144
Great invention. Fun
for the whole family.

06:30.180 --> 06:32.013
Clearly, it broke.

06:32.048 --> 06:35.082
Well, double up next time, then, girl.

06:35.129 --> 06:37.318
Tech rehearsal is tomorrow
and you drop this bomb?

06:37.320 --> 06:38.553
This is crazy.

06:38.588 --> 06:41.522
Star, do you actually
think that she planned this?

06:44.194 --> 06:46.861
How's Derek? How bad is he?

06:46.896 --> 06:48.529
I don't know.

06:48.565 --> 06:50.097
They won't let me see him.

06:50.133 --> 06:51.599
He's in ICU.

06:54.278 --> 06:56.537
I cannot believe I'm pregnant.

06:58.808 --> 07:01.375
I'll babysit for you.

07:03.513 --> 07:06.614
I just came from the hospital.

07:06.649 --> 07:09.183
Miss Ruby about to lose her damn mind.

07:09.219 --> 07:11.252
And you weren't even touched.

07:12.530 --> 07:14.999
God got his hands all on you, girl.

07:16.192 --> 07:18.593
Tell her, Alex.

07:18.628 --> 07:20.561
Tell me what?

07:23.737 --> 07:25.733
Alex is pregnant.

07:25.768 --> 07:29.237
Well, that's inconvenient.

07:29.272 --> 07:31.939
Yeah.

07:38.448 --> 07:40.448
Oh, baby.

07:45.388 --> 07:48.055
I'm glad you decided to come over.

07:48.091 --> 07:50.184
I, uh...

07:50.231 --> 07:52.793
I didn't know what
you like for breakfast.

07:52.829 --> 07:54.862
Thanks, but no thanks.

07:54.898 --> 07:57.298
- I don't do carbs.
- Oh.

07:57.333 --> 08:00.034
Okay. Well, all right.

08:00.069 --> 08:02.336
Mm.

08:04.774 --> 08:07.041
So, uh...

08:07.076 --> 08:09.277
Yeah, are you, uh...

08:09.312 --> 08:13.195
So why you want to do that-that
whole surgery thing, anyway?

08:13.198 --> 08:15.383
So, Mama told you about the surgery.

08:15.418 --> 08:17.618
Oh, no, no, we was, we was just talking.

08:17.654 --> 08:21.144
I'm just trying to... I'm just
trying to catch up with you.

08:23.159 --> 08:24.692
Anyway, are-are you sure

08:24.727 --> 08:26.460
that's, uh, that's what you want to do?

08:26.496 --> 08:27.685
Yeah.

08:27.688 --> 08:29.830
I mean, I can't spend
much longer in this body.

08:29.832 --> 08:31.866
I feel like I'm about to lose my mind.

08:31.901 --> 08:34.467
And then I have my pre-op visit today

08:34.504 --> 08:36.337
and my deposit of half.

08:36.371 --> 08:37.538
I'm good to go.

08:37.573 --> 08:39.907
Ah, good for you.

08:39.943 --> 08:42.109
Um...

08:47.284 --> 08:49.283
I'd-I'd want to be at that surgery,

08:49.319 --> 08:51.485
you know, if that's cool.

08:51.521 --> 08:55.323
Sure... Dad.

08:58.227 --> 08:59.527
We got to work on that.

08:59.562 --> 09:01.028
Dad.

09:01.064 --> 09:03.464
Gonna have to get used to that.

09:05.535 --> 09:07.301
Had I known who you were,

09:07.337 --> 09:10.237
uh, before, I would've made an effort

09:10.273 --> 09:12.039
to spend more time with you.

09:14.477 --> 09:19.146
Okay. So, I mean, anyway,
you have sex with my mom,

09:19.182 --> 09:21.349
and nine months later a baby comes.

09:21.384 --> 09:23.317
I mean, you didn't think at any point

09:23.353 --> 09:24.518
that you might have been...

09:24.554 --> 09:26.854
Yeah, it did, but I was...

09:26.889 --> 09:29.223
I was too high to care.

09:33.733 --> 09:35.419
I'm sorry, Cotton.

09:36.694 --> 09:38.499
I do remember asking her, though.

09:38.534 --> 09:40.101
I went to the prison
when she was pregnant.

09:40.103 --> 09:42.536
I asked. She told me no.

09:42.572 --> 09:46.374
So, I just... I never
thought about it again.

09:56.953 --> 09:59.987
You know, you remind me of my mother.

10:00.023 --> 10:01.689
You look like her, too.

10:01.724 --> 10:04.258
See, I always wondered where
I got this good hair from.

10:04.293 --> 10:05.493
I'm half Mexican.

10:09.065 --> 10:11.399
Actually, I'm from Peru.

10:11.434 --> 10:13.534
Oh.

10:13.569 --> 10:14.635
You Peruvian.

10:14.671 --> 10:16.337
Okay, I could be that, too.

10:16.372 --> 10:17.471
Yeah.

10:28.251 --> 10:29.850
Hey, girl.

10:29.886 --> 10:32.086
I'm off to La-La Land
to become a movie star.

10:32.121 --> 10:35.589
I took your cash to set myself up.

10:36.752 --> 10:40.227
Uh-huh. And thank you for
telling Jahil I had syphilis.

10:40.263 --> 10:41.629
Payback is a bitch.

10:47.103 --> 10:49.737
Oh...

11:14.213 --> 11:15.979
Baby.

11:16.014 --> 11:17.447
Hi.

11:17.482 --> 11:19.182
How you doing?

11:19.218 --> 11:22.586
Forget about me. How are you?

11:22.621 --> 11:24.654
Mm.

11:24.690 --> 11:28.525
Derek, I'm so sorry.

11:28.560 --> 11:30.794
I really am sorry. I...

11:30.829 --> 11:33.496
Stop. Alex, please.

11:33.532 --> 11:37.133
It's okay. Don't be sorry.

11:37.176 --> 11:39.009
I was driving that car.

11:39.037 --> 11:40.370
Yeah, but I picked a fight with you,

11:40.372 --> 11:41.972
and I shouldn't have, and I'm so...

11:42.007 --> 11:44.407
Oh, it's... it's all an accident.

11:44.443 --> 11:47.544
We are... we alive, ain't we?

11:47.579 --> 11:49.312
We were lucky.

11:49.348 --> 11:52.315
We got other things to
worry about right now.

11:52.351 --> 11:54.251
Atlanta NextFest is next weekend.

11:54.286 --> 11:56.519
I don't give a damn
about Atlanta NextFest.

11:56.555 --> 11:58.355
Well, you should give a damn.

11:58.390 --> 12:01.758
You done bust your ass this whole time.

12:01.793 --> 12:04.027
You can't just step away now.

12:04.062 --> 12:06.229
I'm serious.

12:08.066 --> 12:10.934
Door's open.

12:10.969 --> 12:13.570
You got to go through it, babe.

12:14.473 --> 12:16.573
Okay.

12:16.608 --> 12:18.575
You promise me?

12:18.610 --> 12:21.911
Yeah, I promise.

12:23.849 --> 12:26.483
Look, um...

12:28.120 --> 12:31.121
there's, um, something
we need to talk about.

12:32.924 --> 12:34.424
Hey, y'all.

12:34.459 --> 12:36.159
Hi.

12:36.194 --> 12:37.560
How you doing, baby?

12:37.596 --> 12:40.391
Hmm, I'm good, Grandma.

12:40.446 --> 12:43.099
I'm better now that Alex is here.

12:44.336 --> 12:46.469
Sorry, it's one visitor at a time.

12:47.406 --> 12:49.239
Okay.

12:49.274 --> 12:51.975
She's busy anyway.

12:52.911 --> 12:54.844
Mm.

12:54.880 --> 12:56.479
I'll be back.

12:56.515 --> 12:58.515
- Hey. Come here.
- Hi.

13:00.686 --> 13:03.286
You call me if you need anything.

13:05.249 --> 13:07.023
He gonna be fine.

13:07.059 --> 13:08.792
I snuck him in some edibles.

13:08.827 --> 13:10.994
Mm.

13:26.761 --> 13:29.028
I heard you moving out.

13:29.081 --> 13:30.647
What, you gonna miss me?

13:30.682 --> 13:32.615
Look, you may have been
able to blow through life

13:32.651 --> 13:36.119
acting like you ain't
got no effect on people.

13:36.154 --> 13:39.322
But guess what. I'm not the one, okay?

13:40.821 --> 13:43.193
Thought you would've been happy
to get rid of me, honestly.

13:44.259 --> 13:46.463
Just stay your ass here, Star.

13:46.498 --> 13:48.331
It's a little too much, too soon.

13:48.367 --> 13:50.133
Something ain't right about him.

13:50.168 --> 13:52.564
He can ride my bus any
day of the week, honey.

13:52.567 --> 13:53.933
Anybody could.

13:53.936 --> 13:55.438
Hey, Mom, I just came
to pick up my jewelry.

13:55.440 --> 13:57.307
- Can I talk to you before you go?
- Nothing to talk about.

13:57.309 --> 13:59.909
- I just need my jewelry.
- So you could flip it?

14:00.846 --> 14:02.212
Yes.

14:02.247 --> 14:03.480
Yes!

14:03.515 --> 14:04.881
What happened to the money you saved up?

14:04.883 --> 14:05.849
It's gone.

14:05.884 --> 14:07.450
Michelle took it and she split.

14:07.486 --> 14:08.952
Psycho bitch, I knew it.

14:08.987 --> 14:11.187
Hey, why you looking so sad?

14:11.223 --> 14:12.555
You probably happy about it,

14:12.591 --> 14:14.391
'cause now I can't even have my surgery.

14:14.426 --> 14:16.259
No, I'm not. Can you just... can we...

14:16.294 --> 14:18.595
Listen...

14:18.630 --> 14:20.864
you not the only one
who's going through changes

14:20.899 --> 14:22.232
with this whole thing, Cotton.

14:22.267 --> 14:23.366
What?

14:23.402 --> 14:24.534
I lost my son.

14:24.569 --> 14:27.170
Here you go. You are unbelievable!

14:27.205 --> 14:28.671
Stop making everything about you!

14:28.707 --> 14:29.873
I'm not, damn it!

14:29.908 --> 14:32.041
I lost my son.

14:32.077 --> 14:33.713
But I found my daughter.

14:34.681 --> 14:36.579
Cot, I'm-a help you find your jewelry.

14:36.615 --> 14:38.915
I'll finish her braids later. Cot.

14:40.118 --> 14:41.951
Cot!

14:41.987 --> 14:44.888
Cotton.

14:44.923 --> 14:48.091
Okay. Thanks for the update, Miss Ruby.

14:48.126 --> 14:51.461
Yeah, I'll be back in
about an hour or so.

14:51.496 --> 14:54.230
Okay. Bye.

14:54.266 --> 14:56.232
How's Derek?

14:56.268 --> 14:57.500
He's better.

14:57.536 --> 14:59.202
He just wants to get out of there.

14:59.237 --> 15:01.938
Have you not told him the big news?

15:01.973 --> 15:03.306
I tried.

15:03.341 --> 15:05.575
Yo, Alex, you have to tell him.

15:05.610 --> 15:07.010
Look, I know. I just...

15:07.045 --> 15:09.245
- What?
- Look,

15:09.281 --> 15:11.147
I'm sorry, I've never
been pregnant before.

15:11.183 --> 15:14.417
Why you saying it like
I have been pregnant?

15:16.488 --> 15:18.256
Wow, okay.

15:18.295 --> 15:19.840
All right, ladies. Ladies, listen up.

15:19.843 --> 15:21.257
I've been working on some tour dates.

15:21.259 --> 15:22.759
I just booked our first gigs.

15:22.794 --> 15:25.428
What? That's amazing. Where?

15:25.464 --> 15:27.664
Well, we got a five-city
tour in the Midwest.

15:27.699 --> 15:29.184
They're gonna be smaller venues,

15:29.187 --> 15:30.633
but it'll be good for
performance experience.

15:30.635 --> 15:32.035
That's what's up, Jahil.

15:32.070 --> 15:34.103
We're talking no frills, fast food.

15:34.139 --> 15:35.772
Hot water? Probably not.

15:35.807 --> 15:36.982
Why would you say that? You need to work

15:36.984 --> 15:38.208
on your sales pitch a little bit.

15:38.210 --> 15:40.076
You had us at "tour date."

15:40.111 --> 15:41.711
All right, little girls.
I got to meet my next group

15:41.713 --> 15:43.446
in an hour, so we got to hurry this up.

15:43.482 --> 15:44.647
Come on, do what she says, guys.

15:44.649 --> 15:46.216
Rachel is a social media wizard.

15:46.251 --> 15:48.818
Come on, let's go.
Let's not waste my time.

15:48.854 --> 15:51.054
Let's get cozy. Show me what you got.

15:52.991 --> 15:53.957
You,

15:53.992 --> 15:55.058
get a little closer.

15:58.797 --> 16:01.498
Keep going in and out. In and out.

16:03.535 --> 16:05.702
Go over there.

16:05.737 --> 16:07.504
Shouldn't you be in camp right now?

16:07.539 --> 16:08.838
I am.

16:08.874 --> 16:11.307
Just got to keep tabs
on my girl, you know.

16:11.343 --> 16:14.077
Damn, dude.

16:14.112 --> 16:16.012
You might want to take
that obsessive vibe

16:16.047 --> 16:17.447
down just a little bit.

16:17.482 --> 16:19.349
You're running at a nine right now, son.

16:19.384 --> 16:21.451
Nah, it ain't like that.

16:23.062 --> 16:26.022
You know, you didn't have
to lie to me about Eva.

16:26.057 --> 16:28.725
I know she ain't your niece.

16:28.760 --> 16:30.493
You into her?

16:30.529 --> 16:31.561
Okay.

16:31.596 --> 16:33.396
Hey, what's up?

16:33.431 --> 16:36.059
Actually, yeah.

16:36.062 --> 16:38.268
Okay, all right. Let's
cut the Disney crap, okay?

16:38.270 --> 16:39.969
We got to sex this up a little bit.

16:40.005 --> 16:41.504
- Come on.
- Oh.

16:41.540 --> 16:42.906
Star, around.

16:45.343 --> 16:48.878
Okay, left to right,
prettiest to ugliest.

16:51.049 --> 16:52.282
I'm kidding. Not really.

16:54.152 --> 16:55.985
Oh.

16:56.021 --> 16:58.121
Okay, I get it. You're a girl group.

16:58.156 --> 17:00.056
Already hating on each
other. Especially...

17:00.091 --> 17:01.595
Cha-Cha and Peroxide.

17:01.598 --> 17:03.626
But just give me something.
Give me something sexy.

17:03.628 --> 17:04.928
Seriously.

17:10.602 --> 17:12.435
You ever been laid before, Salma?

17:12.470 --> 17:15.204
'Cause right now, I'd say no.

17:15.996 --> 17:17.373
Come on.

17:17.409 --> 17:18.407
You're not 14.

17:21.313 --> 17:23.346
- Yes!
- No.

17:24.415 --> 17:25.214
Just like that.

17:25.250 --> 17:27.450
Come on, sexy. Give it to me.

17:27.484 --> 17:28.585
Is this what you want?

17:28.620 --> 17:30.687
That's what I want. Sexy.

17:30.722 --> 17:31.788
Okay.

17:37.028 --> 17:37.827
Keep it going.

17:37.862 --> 17:40.330
More grabbing.

17:40.365 --> 17:42.465
Keep your eyes on me.

17:42.500 --> 17:43.833
Sexier, dirtier.

17:43.868 --> 17:45.535
Come on.

17:45.570 --> 17:47.637
That's what I'm talking about.

17:47.672 --> 17:49.739
Man, Hunter, what are you gonna do

17:49.774 --> 17:51.274
when Star is gone on tour?

17:59.718 --> 18:01.250
What?

18:04.823 --> 18:06.990
I love you.

18:10.428 --> 18:13.963
Okay.

18:13.999 --> 18:16.899
That's your response?

18:16.935 --> 18:21.004
I'm sorry. I don't... I'm
not used to any of this.

18:21.039 --> 18:24.307
What, what, a relationship?

18:24.339 --> 18:27.610
A man sticking around after sex,

18:27.646 --> 18:29.345
wanting anything else
from me. I'm not...

18:29.381 --> 18:30.947
Well, I do! And I've told
you from the beginning...

18:30.949 --> 18:32.148
No, no, no, no, baby.

18:32.183 --> 18:34.751
I'm sorry. I'm not
say... Please come back.

18:34.786 --> 18:37.086
You know, I thought that
buying us this place,

18:37.122 --> 18:38.488
we could see what it would be like,

18:38.490 --> 18:39.555
living together.

18:39.591 --> 18:40.723
We can, we are,

18:40.759 --> 18:42.825
we will when I get back from tour.

18:42.861 --> 18:46.295
Baby, I don't want you to go on tour.

18:50.268 --> 18:52.368
Hunter, that's not
even an option for me.

18:52.404 --> 18:54.871
Baby, please, stay.

18:59.210 --> 19:01.811
You could come with me.

19:01.846 --> 19:03.780
Come with me, baby.

19:03.815 --> 19:06.182
It's the best I can do.
You could come with me.

19:06.217 --> 19:08.484
You could protect me from
all the creepy drunk dudes.

19:08.520 --> 19:11.220
Why are you making a joke of this?

19:11.256 --> 19:13.456
I'm not. What is it
that you're trying to do?

19:13.491 --> 19:14.876
I just told you that I loved you.

19:14.879 --> 19:18.695
What do you want me to
say, Hunter? That I...

19:22.567 --> 19:24.300
That I love you, too?

19:28.063 --> 19:29.706
I do.

19:34.446 --> 19:36.379
But I don't want you to hurt me.

19:36.414 --> 19:39.348
Baby, don't go. Don't go.

19:39.638 --> 19:40.937
It's a tour.

19:40.940 --> 19:42.852
- Don't go.
- I can't pass up a tour.

19:42.887 --> 19:44.854
It's gonna be dives the whole way.

19:44.889 --> 19:47.557
It's everything that we've worked for.

19:50.595 --> 19:55.164
I wouldn't ask you to give up a season.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.433
I know exactly what kind
of girls are on the road,

19:57.469 --> 19:59.163
trying to get wired by a pro athlete,

19:59.166 --> 20:00.937
but I wouldn't do that.

20:00.972 --> 20:03.473
Because I trust you.

20:03.508 --> 20:04.640
Do you?

20:04.676 --> 20:05.775
Yes.

20:05.810 --> 20:08.111
Why?

20:09.981 --> 20:12.915
Didn't you just hear me say I love you?

20:12.951 --> 20:14.684
Then show me.

20:16.554 --> 20:18.254
Stay.

20:20.290 --> 20:21.856
Stay, baby.

20:29.931 --> 20:32.442
Okay, y'all, this is our last practice.

20:32.444 --> 20:34.164

Hey, listen, I know you
don't want to see me...

23:25.776 --> 23:27.675
Geez, Cotton. This is not a good time.

23:27.711 --> 23:29.277
Come on, you said that you loved me.

23:29.312 --> 23:31.346
I take it back.

23:31.381 --> 23:33.181
How do you take
something like that back?

23:33.216 --> 23:34.249
Keep your voice down.

23:34.284 --> 23:36.484
Hold up. Is somebody in there?

23:41.691 --> 23:43.428
A white bitch.

23:45.162 --> 23:46.694
Lisa, stay.

23:46.730 --> 23:47.952
This person was just leaving.

23:47.955 --> 23:49.931
Nah, "this person" left
her thong in your bed,

23:49.933 --> 23:51.833
and she's going to retrieve it.

23:57.874 --> 23:59.774
I am not dealing with this.

23:59.810 --> 24:01.142
I am leaving.

24:01.178 --> 24:03.178
- Stay.
- For what?

24:03.213 --> 24:06.381
Just let me... Elliot,
let me out of here.

24:08.674 --> 24:10.184
Yo, Alex. What's happening?

24:10.187 --> 24:11.619
- Big! What's up?
- What's up?

24:11.655 --> 24:12.720
I see y'all ain't taking no prisoners.

24:12.722 --> 24:13.922
What up?

24:13.957 --> 24:15.490
- How you doing?
- What's up, Slim Goody?

24:15.492 --> 24:16.591
- Hey.
- What's up? What's happening?

24:16.593 --> 24:17.926
- What's up?
- Hey, I'm Eva.

24:17.961 --> 24:19.894
What's up, man? What's happening?

24:19.930 --> 24:21.563
All right, so how do you think we did?

24:21.565 --> 24:23.898
You think we could win that
fat-ass recording contract?

24:23.934 --> 24:26.768
I mean, I think y'all made it
all the way to the Honda Stage.

24:26.803 --> 24:28.703
Fifth Harmony, Ariana Grande

24:28.738 --> 24:30.371
was on this very stage right here.

24:30.407 --> 24:32.507
That's a huge step.

24:32.542 --> 24:33.842
With a little wind at your back,

24:33.877 --> 24:35.944
you might be able to go all the way.

24:35.979 --> 24:37.545
Wait, I'm confused.

24:37.581 --> 24:39.881
Last time you saw us,
you said it was a wrap.

24:39.916 --> 24:41.749
Now you're trying to help us?

24:41.785 --> 24:44.853
Now maybe I might want to
produce y'all first album.

24:44.888 --> 24:47.155
Oh, my God.

24:47.190 --> 24:48.957
Don't play with my emotions.
Big, are you serious?

24:48.959 --> 24:50.458
No, that is amazing, though.

24:50.461 --> 24:52.392
One rule, though: no dead weight.

24:52.395 --> 24:53.463
I agree.

24:53.466 --> 24:55.687
100%. Sometimes you got
to thin the herd, you know?

24:55.690 --> 24:57.753
Started with three girls,
we finish with three girls.

24:57.755 --> 24:58.666
Drop it, Star.

24:58.702 --> 25:00.283
Four of y'all, I'm cool with all that,

25:00.286 --> 25:01.970
but I work one-on-one with my artists.

25:02.005 --> 25:03.605
I call all the shots.

25:03.640 --> 25:05.273
And I'm not finna have a wannabe manager

25:05.308 --> 25:06.574
pinned to the ceiling on blow

25:06.610 --> 25:08.409
getting in the way. Never.

25:08.445 --> 25:10.378
So you talking about dropping Jahil.

25:10.413 --> 25:12.313
That's if you want me.

25:12.349 --> 25:14.349
He got us to Atlanta NextFest.

25:14.384 --> 25:16.484
I mean, yeah.

25:16.520 --> 25:18.953
Yeah, but I'll get you to the Grammys.

25:18.989 --> 25:20.655
Think about it.

25:24.845 --> 25:26.756
- We're going to the Grammys!
- I want a Grammy.

25:34.807 --> 25:37.042
Hey! Hey!

25:37.077 --> 25:38.410
Nah, nah, nah. He okay, Rodney.

25:38.445 --> 25:40.012
He ain't finna do
nothing. What's happening?

25:40.014 --> 25:42.014
- You trying to poach my girls?
- Your girls?

25:42.049 --> 25:43.482
- Yeah.
- What you think, you still running

25:43.484 --> 25:45.517
$20 tricks on Stewart
Avenue or something?

25:45.552 --> 25:48.453
You ain't answered my question, man.

25:48.489 --> 25:49.688
You a clown.

25:49.723 --> 25:51.323
Old Jahil,

25:51.358 --> 25:54.001
always 20 cents short of a
quarter, trying to make change.

25:54.004 --> 25:56.028
Yo, what you looking at them for?

25:56.030 --> 25:57.963
They know it. I know it.

25:57.998 --> 25:59.965
And every time you look
in the mirror, guess what,

26:00.000 --> 26:01.466
you know it, too.

26:01.502 --> 26:04.202
Oh, Big Boi here, he
rolls deep, doesn't he?

26:04.238 --> 26:05.904
You know how he does it?

26:05.939 --> 26:07.305
Off the backs of all of his artists.

26:07.307 --> 26:08.340
They write the music,

26:08.375 --> 26:10.194
they write the lyrics, they're out there

26:10.197 --> 26:11.977
shaking their asses 200 nights a year.

26:11.979 --> 26:13.819
They're on the grind.
You? You just rubberstamp

26:13.847 --> 26:14.980
your name on it, call it yours,

26:14.982 --> 26:16.281
watch the money roll
in while the suckers

26:16.283 --> 26:17.749
get the crumbs. You know what, man?

26:17.785 --> 26:19.384
I might be a lot of things,
but I ain't no sponge.

26:19.386 --> 26:20.519
Trust me on that.

26:20.554 --> 26:22.821
Jahil, why would we
trust you on anything?

26:22.856 --> 26:24.623
You just got through lying to us,

26:24.658 --> 26:26.992
making us put Eva in the
group with that phony-ass rule.

26:27.027 --> 26:28.956
- What, you thought we didn't know?
- That's not true.

26:28.958 --> 26:31.296
- Bitch, I've been waiting for
this moment. - Oh, yeah?

26:31.331 --> 26:33.432
Why do you think that we still
don't know that you're lying?

26:33.434 --> 26:36.038
You're a bigger con than he
is, with your broken English

26:36.041 --> 26:38.336
and your wide-eyed amazement,
you little puppy dog.

26:38.372 --> 26:40.305
- Oh, honey. You got that wrong.
- You been smashing him

26:40.307 --> 26:42.374
since you slithered in here,
you down-low, dirty-ass snake.

26:42.376 --> 26:43.608
Yes. How about if I smash you?!

26:44.978 --> 26:46.711
- I would love it!
- Huh? You would?

26:46.747 --> 26:49.014
Old habits die hard, huh, Flaco?

26:49.049 --> 26:51.850
You know what? Alex, you got my number.

26:51.885 --> 26:53.151
You see how I do it.

26:53.187 --> 26:56.555
If y'all want to ride in
style, holla at your boy.

26:56.590 --> 26:57.589
Somebody go buy him

26:57.624 --> 26:59.024
some new boots.

26:59.059 --> 27:01.927
He been walking a lot. Sucker.

27:07.768 --> 27:09.367
That's embarrassing.

27:12.840 --> 27:15.407
I just got an anonymous
tip on Otis Leecan.

27:15.442 --> 27:17.042
- You think it's legit?
- I hope so.

27:17.077 --> 27:18.577
Someone saw the car at the burial site,

27:18.579 --> 27:20.579
called in the license plate number.

27:20.614 --> 27:21.880
Guy that owns it

27:21.915 --> 27:23.915
is Jahil Rivera.

27:25.319 --> 27:26.952
He's got a record.

27:26.987 --> 27:29.221
Great. Sounds like our guy.

27:29.256 --> 27:32.457
Let's see if there's
any blood in that trunk.

27:34.228 --> 27:36.428
You know, I actually
kind of feel bad for him,

27:36.463 --> 27:38.730
standing there all alone
with that look on his face.

27:38.765 --> 27:40.198
How, Simone?

27:40.234 --> 27:41.766
How do you feel bad for him?

27:41.802 --> 27:43.735
Nah. He lied to us.

27:43.770 --> 27:45.971
You need to realize something.

27:46.006 --> 27:47.038
Listen carefully to me.

27:47.074 --> 27:48.754
We have way too much
on the line right now.

27:48.775 --> 27:51.610
And we can't afford to let
anybody jeopardize that.

27:51.645 --> 27:53.411
Big Boi wants us.

27:53.447 --> 27:56.114
How many acts do you think
he's out there going after?

27:56.150 --> 27:58.650
This is us all day, girl.

27:58.685 --> 28:00.185
You know Big Boi don't play.

28:00.220 --> 28:02.721
Okay, so I just got off
the phone with Moses.

28:02.756 --> 28:04.990
He says one of the ways
to nullify the contract

28:05.025 --> 28:06.725
is through a force majeure.

28:06.760 --> 28:07.901
A force ma-what?

28:07.904 --> 28:09.694
We have to prove that Jahil is either

28:09.696 --> 28:11.229
physically or mentally incapable

28:11.265 --> 28:12.931
of fulfilling his duties as a manager.

28:12.966 --> 28:16.001
Well, he's about two
lines away from an O.D.

28:16.036 --> 28:17.269
That work?

28:17.304 --> 28:18.570
Unfortunately not.

28:18.605 --> 28:20.939
He needs to be
incapacitated in some way.

28:20.974 --> 28:22.941
I can call my cousin Jerry.

28:22.976 --> 28:24.809
He'll bust a cap in his knee.

28:25.812 --> 28:27.546
Shut up, Bruce.

28:27.581 --> 28:31.383
Look, I am far from Jahil's biggest fan,

28:31.418 --> 28:33.385
but he did deliver
y'all Atlanta NextFest.

28:33.420 --> 28:35.176
You got to recognize that.

28:35.179 --> 28:36.311
By lying to us.

28:36.314 --> 28:38.523
So what? Where's your loyalty?

28:38.559 --> 28:41.087
Exactly. You throw stones in this shop,

28:41.090 --> 28:42.827
you ain't gonna hit nothing but liars.

28:42.863 --> 28:45.567
I mean, how are we ever
supposed to trust him again?

28:45.570 --> 28:47.666
Well, he got more than trust.

28:47.701 --> 28:49.467
He got a signed contract.

28:58.045 --> 28:59.444
Hey, Derek.

29:01.882 --> 29:03.048
Hey, Doc?

29:03.083 --> 29:05.884
I like your face and all...

29:05.919 --> 29:08.553
You're a handsome guy, but
when am I getting out of here?

29:10.023 --> 29:13.992
Better yet, when is this
medication gonna wear off?

29:14.027 --> 29:18.196
'Cause I can't move my legs so much.

29:18.232 --> 29:21.466
We got the results back from your MRI.

29:21.501 --> 29:24.369
There was nerve damage
to your spinal cord.

29:24.404 --> 29:26.871
Nerve damage?

29:28.308 --> 29:31.741
The damage you suffered was a T7 injury.

29:31.744 --> 29:33.545
That's why you can straighten your arms

29:33.547 --> 29:35.981
and have normal movement
in your shoulders.

29:37.684 --> 29:41.519
You're lucky the damage
was limited to what it was.

29:44.958 --> 29:47.959
The fact that you and your girlfriend

29:47.995 --> 29:51.263
survived that collision
at all is a miracle.

29:53.600 --> 29:56.735
But it's unlikely that
you will walk again, Derek.

30:05.712 --> 30:08.413
We have counselors at the
hospital you can talk to...

30:08.448 --> 30:11.616
I don't need counselors!

30:16.390 --> 30:17.941
I'm sorry, Derek.

30:24.598 --> 30:26.364
Do me favor.

30:27.901 --> 30:31.703
Don't say anything to my
grandma or my girlfriend.

30:57.084 --> 30:59.652
Hey.

30:59.687 --> 31:01.987
- Babe?
- Mm.

31:02.023 --> 31:05.157
Do you think I could be a solo artist?

31:05.192 --> 31:07.526
Uh, verdad?

31:07.561 --> 31:11.230
The truth is all I'm looking for.

31:11.265 --> 31:13.499
Okay.

31:13.534 --> 31:16.101
Well...

31:16.137 --> 31:19.238
You weren't a part of this plan.

31:19.273 --> 31:21.974
Not part of this group, none of it.

31:22.009 --> 31:25.177
I mean, I was so focused
on making this group work,

31:25.212 --> 31:27.012
so focused on Star.

31:27.048 --> 31:28.514
Mm-hmm.

31:28.549 --> 31:31.517
And then you just fell into place.

31:34.889 --> 31:36.422
And now?

31:38.616 --> 31:41.885
Now you're all I see.

31:41.888 --> 31:43.988
You blindsided me, Eva.

31:46.200 --> 31:48.867
You got into my head,
and that ain't easy to do.

31:48.903 --> 31:52.705
You're all I think about.

31:52.740 --> 31:54.206
All I see.

31:54.241 --> 31:57.376
All the time.

32:06.821 --> 32:08.754
Are you gonna get that?

32:08.789 --> 32:10.789
Nope, I'm in the middle
of a conversation.

32:10.825 --> 32:13.292
Go.

32:13.327 --> 32:15.361
I need to take a shower. Go.

32:18.099 --> 32:19.565
Who is it?

32:19.600 --> 32:20.999
Cotton.

32:21.035 --> 32:22.368
Just a minute.

32:24.038 --> 32:26.438
Hey, sorry for popping up
like this. I need a favor.

32:26.474 --> 32:27.973
Nah, don't worry about
it. What's happening, baby?

32:27.975 --> 32:29.541
Come on in. Everything all right?

32:29.577 --> 32:31.009
Yeah, I need a favor.

32:31.045 --> 32:32.511
What's going on?

32:33.514 --> 32:34.980
I need a fake I.D.

32:35.015 --> 32:36.849
What did you do?

32:36.884 --> 32:39.218
Well, nothing yet, but this
is a very delicate situation.

32:39.253 --> 32:40.919
I just need somebody I can trust.

32:40.955 --> 32:43.856
What, are you planning on
robbing a bank or something?

32:43.891 --> 32:45.657
Come on, the less you know, the better.

32:45.693 --> 32:47.793
Could you just trust me on this?

32:47.828 --> 32:48.996
- Cotton, look...
- Come on, don't

32:48.998 --> 32:50.164
you want to make it up to me

32:50.197 --> 32:51.663
for not being there as a father?

32:51.699 --> 32:54.032
Hey, hey, that-that's
not even fair, okay?

32:54.068 --> 32:55.567
But we're way beyond fair, Jahil.

32:55.603 --> 32:57.202
Just do this one thing
for me, this one ask,

32:57.204 --> 32:58.937
and then I won't bother you no more.

32:58.973 --> 33:01.206
Look, would you just stop
with this whole one ask thing?

33:01.242 --> 33:03.142
This one favor thing?
Would you stop with that?

33:03.177 --> 33:04.877
I got you, all right?

33:04.912 --> 33:06.912
I'm gonna talk to Jahil

33:06.947 --> 33:09.782
and see if he can postpone the tour.

33:09.817 --> 33:11.750
I'm not leaving you.

33:13.487 --> 33:15.854
Alex, I'm gonna be fine.

33:20.494 --> 33:22.161
There it is.

33:22.196 --> 33:23.362
What?

33:23.397 --> 33:26.331
That little line on your forehead.

33:26.367 --> 33:27.933
That's...

33:27.968 --> 33:29.635
"something's coming" line.

33:31.639 --> 33:33.205
Tell me.

33:33.240 --> 33:35.874
Give it to me straight.

33:39.180 --> 33:40.712
Okay.

33:50.191 --> 33:52.491
I'm pregnant, Derek.

33:57.698 --> 33:59.198
Say something.

34:01.202 --> 34:02.734
Wow.

34:02.770 --> 34:06.438
Is that a happy "wow" or
run for the hills "wow"?

34:13.179 --> 34:15.813
I don't know how I'm supposed to feel.

34:18.385 --> 34:21.085
Yeah, me neither.

34:32.766 --> 34:34.399
A baby.

34:43.244 --> 34:45.511
Listen.

34:50.612 --> 34:53.844
Whatever we decide,
I'm sticking with you.

34:56.623 --> 34:58.257
Okay?

35:00.494 --> 35:02.094
Wow.

35:12.406 --> 35:14.873
And Jameson on the sidelines...

35:14.909 --> 35:16.942
He got both feet in! It's a catch.

35:16.977 --> 35:19.077
Nice play.

35:19.113 --> 35:21.413
First and ten at the 33 yard line.

35:21.448 --> 35:24.616
Killing a 12-pack
part of your training?

35:26.053 --> 35:28.086
Mirra this time from the shotgun.

35:28.122 --> 35:31.783
Are you having a senior moment?
Hunter, can you turn it down?

35:32.693 --> 35:34.493
Wilkins breaks free...

35:34.528 --> 35:37.029
Hunter, I don't have time and
energy for a fight right now.

35:37.064 --> 35:39.024
Down the right side at the 40.

35:39.033 --> 35:40.299
Seriously?!

35:40.334 --> 35:41.600
And the 30! Hauled down...

35:41.635 --> 35:42.968
What is wrong with you?

35:43.904 --> 35:45.704
You're psycho, you know that?

35:45.739 --> 35:48.040
Yeah, you know what? Maybe
too many blows to the head.

35:48.075 --> 35:49.975
What's your excuse, huh?

35:50.010 --> 35:52.177
This is really what
you're gonna do to me?

35:52.212 --> 35:54.079
Right when the biggest thing in my life

35:54.114 --> 35:56.281
- is about to happen?
- I thought that this,

35:56.317 --> 35:58.617
this was the biggest thing of your life!

35:59.920 --> 36:01.954
It's incredible, Hunter, but it's...

36:01.989 --> 36:02.955
But what? What?

36:02.990 --> 36:04.690
It's a house!

36:04.725 --> 36:07.440
This is a house, a really nice house!

36:07.443 --> 36:10.062
It is not my dream! This is not music!

36:10.097 --> 36:12.164
- Stop begin such a diva.
- I am a diva.

36:12.199 --> 36:15.067
And if you can't handle it,
you need to tell me right now,

36:15.102 --> 36:17.836
because I am done making myself
small to fit into your world.

36:17.871 --> 36:19.905
Oh, you clawed your way into my world.

36:19.940 --> 36:23.141
I could claw my way into
much better than your world.

36:28.482 --> 36:30.449
Damn it, Star.

36:30.484 --> 36:33.051
Look what you made me do!

36:56.011 --> 36:57.511
Star?

37:01.173 --> 37:02.539
Star?

37:11.339 --> 37:13.773
What are you doing here?

37:13.808 --> 37:16.943
I'm not here to fight.

37:16.978 --> 37:19.111
I...

37:19.147 --> 37:21.314
I brought your favorite, foie gras.

37:21.349 --> 37:23.983
I went all the way to
Lenox Square to find it.

37:24.018 --> 37:26.552
Thank you.

37:26.588 --> 37:29.489
But I'm a little nauseous right now.

37:29.524 --> 37:31.123
I know what that feels like.

37:31.159 --> 37:34.360
You gave me the worst morning sickness.

37:34.395 --> 37:36.529
Really?

37:36.564 --> 37:38.831
Yes.

37:40.683 --> 37:42.602
Alexandra,

37:42.637 --> 37:47.607
I know that I was the child
and you were the parent.

37:47.642 --> 37:50.476
And I wish I could say that
I've been a great mother to you,

37:50.512 --> 37:52.478
but we both know that's not true.

37:52.514 --> 37:54.380
Mom, it's okay.

37:54.415 --> 37:55.982
No, it's not okay.

37:56.017 --> 38:00.953
I want to be a mother to
you, a real mother to you.

38:06.349 --> 38:08.466
I'm really scared right now.

38:08.469 --> 38:09.702
Of course you are. You've...

38:09.705 --> 38:12.197
I'm not asking for you to answer.

38:12.200 --> 38:14.000
Got it.

38:14.035 --> 38:17.837
I need to make this decision on my own.

38:17.872 --> 38:20.473
Okay.

38:20.508 --> 38:22.475
And whatever I decide...

38:22.510 --> 38:25.344
I'll support it.

38:29.417 --> 38:32.051
Do you mean that?

38:34.455 --> 38:36.589
