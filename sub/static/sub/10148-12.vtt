WEBVTT

01:12.198 --> 01:13.199
And then what did you do?

01:13.616 --> 01:14.616
Well, I...

01:15.660 --> 01:17.912
What does it matter?
It was a long time ago.

01:18.579 --> 01:19.914
A very long time.

01:20.665 --> 01:21.916
Don't wanna talk about it, huh?

01:23.084 --> 01:24.335
In case you haven't noticed,

01:24.418 --> 01:26.458
we've still got a lot of this shrapnel
to deal with.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.190
You'd think that
someone in a suit like this

01:28.214 --> 01:30.466
would be able to dodge
a simple hand grenade.

01:30.549 --> 01:32.093
I did dodge a hand grenade.

01:32.176 --> 01:33.970
The problem was, Mad Stan had two.

01:34.887 --> 01:36.305
Now come on, finish your story.

01:36.389 --> 01:38.629
How'd you know Robin would
get there in time to save you?

01:38.891 --> 01:39.891
I didn't.

01:41.560 --> 01:42.478
Then for all you knew,

01:42.561 --> 01:44.321
you were walking into a trap
with no way out.

01:44.438 --> 01:45.439
Sometimes you have to.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.191
But, you could've been...

01:50.361 --> 01:52.238
Quiet down. We're trying to talk here.

01:55.074 --> 01:56.200
Ace! Off!

01:59.453 --> 02:00.788
Ace, stop it!

02:01.539 --> 02:02.539
Stop it!

02:15.594 --> 02:16.637
What got into him?

02:40.369 --> 02:42.038
So it happened to yours, too, huh?

02:43.789 --> 02:45.249
Mine tried to jump a pit bull.

02:50.171 --> 02:51.672
You have any idea what's going on?

02:51.756 --> 02:54.550
Nope. I'm just glad
I don't live anywhere near the zoo.

02:54.633 --> 02:55.633
Zoo...

03:05.519 --> 03:07.271
I've never seen him like this before.

03:07.355 --> 03:08.856
He's gonna make it next time,

03:08.939 --> 03:10.441
and I'm out of tranquilizers.

04:45.077 --> 04:46.787
Thanks. We got it from here.

04:46.871 --> 04:48.456
Everything's gonna be okay, Tiffany.

04:48.539 --> 04:49.539
Yeah.

04:50.458 --> 04:51.458
Tiffany.

04:56.255 --> 04:57.465
Doesn't make any sense.

04:57.548 --> 04:58.548
It might.

04:58.674 --> 05:01.510
The disturbances started at midnight
and ended at 2:00.

05:02.011 --> 05:04.263
At the same time,
the military reported interference

05:04.346 --> 05:05.806
on certain sonar frequencies.

05:06.140 --> 05:07.975
So, we're talking sound here.

05:08.684 --> 05:10.186
And you know who that means.

05:15.983 --> 05:16.983
We all done, Shriek?

05:17.318 --> 05:18.318
For tonight, Ollie.

05:18.527 --> 05:20.613
But now that I know
my system can blanket the city,

05:20.946 --> 05:22.406
there's a lot more for you to do.

05:22.698 --> 05:24.909
Till they pay you <i>mucho</i> creds
to ease up, right?

05:26.410 --> 05:28.871
Credits? After what was taken from me,

05:28.954 --> 05:31.290
do you honestly think
I care about money?

05:31.749 --> 05:33.751
Ollie, there's a whole world
of sound out there

05:33.834 --> 05:36.378
that I'll never hear
outside of this stinking suit!

05:38.797 --> 05:40.132
Uh, guess not.

05:40.799 --> 05:42.092
So, why are we doing this?

05:49.266 --> 05:51.143
<i>Batman saved us and the animals.</i>

05:51.227 --> 05:52.394
<i>Yeah, the guy's incredible.</i>

05:52.478 --> 05:53.478
<i>A real hero.</i>

05:53.521 --> 05:54.521
What I want

05:54.855 --> 05:55.981
is to change all that.

05:56.273 --> 05:57.525
Batman, huh?

05:57.608 --> 05:58.776
What did he do to you?

06:02.363 --> 06:04.490
Ollie, it's been along night.

06:04.907 --> 06:06.867
I think you've earned some time
with the fork.

06:07.826 --> 06:08.826
The fork?

06:08.953 --> 06:12.164
Sound vibrations directly stimulating
the brain's pleasure center.

06:13.666 --> 06:15.209
Isn't this better than creds?

06:15.292 --> 06:17.545
Oh, yeah. Most definitely.

06:46.031 --> 06:48.284
Shreeve was discharged
by that mental hospital he was in.

06:48.826 --> 06:49.910
They say they cured him.

06:51.036 --> 06:52.036
Cured him, huh?

06:52.454 --> 06:53.454
Do you believe that?

06:53.747 --> 06:55.541
As the guy he blames
for his hearing loss,

06:55.624 --> 06:56.625
I'd say no.

06:56.959 --> 06:58.294
It had to have been Shriek.

06:58.586 --> 06:59.586
But Why?

07:01.046 --> 07:02.046
And how?

07:02.214 --> 07:03.674
That suit of his was pretty powerful

07:03.757 --> 07:06.343
but I don't see how it could've affected
that much of the city.

07:06.635 --> 07:09.013
Maybe he found some way to...

07:09.972 --> 07:10.972
What?

07:11.390 --> 07:12.558
You're not making...

07:14.602 --> 07:16.020
Terry, what's happening to you?

07:34.747 --> 07:37.833
Everyone's... going... nuts.

07:46.842 --> 07:50.012
Shriek must've found a way to interfere

07:50.095 --> 07:52.014
with the vibrations of air molecules.

07:59.855 --> 08:03.525
Air molecules carry the vibrations
of human speech.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.863
That's what I get
for sleeping through physics.

08:21.335 --> 08:23.420
Okay, Jace,
after this, we'll call it quits,

08:23.504 --> 08:25.255
maybe go for some pizza or...

08:27.091 --> 08:28.509
What? Please repeat.

08:31.470 --> 08:32.888
Jace, you all right?

08:34.640 --> 08:37.142
<i>I can't understand you.
You on the right frequency?</i>

08:39.478 --> 08:41.563
Jace, you're getting too close.

08:43.774 --> 08:44.858
Jace, pull up.

08:45.275 --> 08:46.275
Pull up!

10:57.825 --> 10:59.576
That's not gonna do any good, Dave.

11:01.829 --> 11:03.163
The city's going crazy.

11:04.957 --> 11:07.960
And I've alerted the newspapers
to print emergency instructions.

11:08.252 --> 11:09.962
Wait a minute. I can understand you.

11:10.212 --> 11:11.672
And you're making sense now, too.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.799
As much as you usually make, anyway.

11:17.386 --> 11:18.386
Gordon.

11:18.512 --> 11:19.512
<i>It's Shriek.</i>

11:19.847 --> 11:22.057
<i>I shut off the interference
so you could hear this.</i>

11:22.349 --> 11:25.185
<i>I'm willing to give the city back
its sanity permanently</i>

11:25.269 --> 11:27.437
<i>in exchange for Batman's life.</i>

11:27.771 --> 11:29.606
Batman? There's no way I can...

11:29.690 --> 11:31.233
Tonight. Midnight.

11:31.441 --> 11:32.441
Hill Square.

11:32.734 --> 11:35.445
If he's not there,
things will get even worse.

11:36.822 --> 11:38.115
You're out of your mind.

11:38.532 --> 11:39.532
<i>Duh.</i>

11:57.050 --> 11:59.011
He's using a jamming signal.
I'm sure of it.

11:59.553 --> 12:01.847
The problem is finding out
where the signal's coming from.

12:02.431 --> 12:04.516
Here are the places
where the effect was most severe.

12:04.933 --> 12:06.853
But it's still gonna take some time
to isolate...

12:10.522 --> 12:13.025
<i>Bruce, the truce is only temporary.</i>

12:14.359 --> 12:15.611
Why am I not surprised.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.279
<i>We're mobilizing,</i>

12:17.362 --> 12:19.489
<i>but even if we're lucky,
hundreds will die.</i>

12:19.781 --> 12:20.781
<i>Maybe thousands.</i>

12:20.824 --> 12:23.368
We're trying to find his transmitter,
and once we do...

12:23.702 --> 12:24.912
<i>He wants Batman.</i>

12:25.203 --> 12:26.204
<i>That's his price.</i>

12:27.915 --> 12:30.626
If he wants Batman, he can have me.

12:30.918 --> 12:31.960
<i>You're not him.</i>

12:32.336 --> 12:33.962
<i>At least you're not the one he wants.</i>

12:36.632 --> 12:38.008
What are you saying, Barbara?

12:38.467 --> 12:40.469
That I should just hand Terry over
to Shriek?

12:40.844 --> 12:42.262
<i>No. Give him to me.</i>

12:42.346 --> 12:43.472
<i>I'll figure out something.</i>

12:43.931 --> 12:45.682
<i>I had some
pretty good teachers, remember?</i>

12:45.933 --> 12:46.933
I remember,

12:47.267 --> 12:49.037
but you work for a mayor
who'd sell out the kid

12:49.061 --> 12:50.061
at the drop of a hat.

12:50.395 --> 12:51.897
<i>Look, if you've got a better plan...</i>

12:51.980 --> 12:53.523
All I know right now is this.

12:53.899 --> 12:55.943
That kid's done a lot for this city.

12:56.026 --> 12:58.236
It's time for the city
to do something for him.

12:59.571 --> 13:00.697
<i>We're trying, Bruce,</i>

13:01.031 --> 13:02.616
<i>but we've only got till midnight.</i>

13:02.908 --> 13:03.908
<i>What then?</i>

13:07.996 --> 13:10.040
We've got to figure out
where it's coming from.

13:11.875 --> 13:12.875
Terry?

13:15.712 --> 13:16.712
Thousands, huh?

13:17.297 --> 13:18.799
Yeah, thousands.

13:19.216 --> 13:21.802
AII balanced
against the life of one person, me.

13:25.389 --> 13:28.308
You know,
there are other kinds of losses.

13:28.725 --> 13:30.852
- Like what?
- Like your mom losing a son.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.772
Like Matt losing his big brother
so soon after his father.

13:34.106 --> 13:36.483
Then there's Dana's loss,
not to mention my own.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.027
You're gonna do that to us?

13:42.698 --> 13:44.282
<i>Midnight's fast approaching,</i>

13:44.366 --> 13:47.077
<i>and Shriek,
the sound genius with the unsound mind,</i>

13:47.160 --> 13:49.079
<i>doesn't appear likely
to lift the deadline</i>

13:49.162 --> 13:50.747
<i>for his rendezvous with Batman.</i>

13:51.206 --> 13:53.333
<i>If the vicious vigilante doesn't show,</i>

13:53.583 --> 13:55.794
<i>we'll all get another dose
of Shriek's babel</i>

13:55.877 --> 13:57.295
<i>and this one'll be lethal.</i>

13:57.629 --> 14:01.008
<i>Latonya Choi's been sampling
public opinion at the galleria.</i>

14:01.341 --> 14:02.718
Sure, Shriek's crazy,

14:02.801 --> 14:04.428
but there's two sides to every story.

14:04.761 --> 14:06.555
You don't go around provoking a madman,

14:06.763 --> 14:07.973
<i>and that's what Batman did.</i>

14:09.516 --> 14:12.185
That's who you're thinking
of sacrificing yourself for?

14:14.229 --> 14:15.772
<i>Shriek just wants a little justice.</i>

14:19.735 --> 14:20.902
Ollie, it's time.

14:23.447 --> 14:24.447
Ollie!

14:42.591 --> 14:43.591
Dad?

14:46.094 --> 14:47.094
Oh, my God.

14:57.939 --> 14:59.649
Where is he? Where's Dad?

15:03.653 --> 15:04.653
Dad?

15:05.906 --> 15:06.906
Dad!

15:17.125 --> 15:19.961
Batman got us into this mess
and now he's gotta get us out.

15:20.295 --> 15:22.255
Even if he has to sacrifice
his own life?

15:22.714 --> 15:25.092
<i>Why should we all suffer
because of a private dispute?</i>

15:28.011 --> 15:29.346
Spineless fools.

15:37.771 --> 15:38.771
Terry.

15:40.023 --> 15:41.358
You sound surprised.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.902
You're not thinking of handing yourself
over to him, are you?

15:43.985 --> 15:45.779
That's not my first choice, no.

15:46.071 --> 15:47.739
I wouldn't blame you if you stayed home.

15:48.198 --> 15:50.367
Not after what all those ingrates
have been saying.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.410
I didn't get into this for gratitude.

15:52.494 --> 15:53.934
I have a feeling you didn't, either.

16:07.050 --> 16:08.050
That's it.

16:08.218 --> 16:09.386
That's how he's doing it.

16:10.095 --> 16:10.929
How?

16:11.012 --> 16:12.013
How's he doing it?

16:13.140 --> 16:14.266
I'm sure of it.

16:14.349 --> 16:16.309
He's found a way to adapt the...

16:16.601 --> 16:19.187
What? He must've started
the interference again.

16:19.271 --> 16:20.271
I can't...

16:32.701 --> 16:34.035
The towers.

16:34.369 --> 16:36.413
He's using them as a giant tuning fork.

17:39.059 --> 17:40.435
This isn't how I wanted it.

17:40.518 --> 17:42.238
You were supposed
to give yourself up to me.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.940
You should've gotten it in writing.

17:45.023 --> 17:47.943
Funny. See how funny you think this is.

18:15.971 --> 18:17.681
Now I've got the advantage.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.001
Oh, no.

18:50.380 --> 18:52.299
I can't shut it off. I can't...

18:52.674 --> 18:55.260
The whole frequency vibration,
it's gonna knock down the towers.

19:19.909 --> 19:22.454
The towers are falling.
Get away from there.

19:22.537 --> 19:24.122
No use pleading.

19:24.205 --> 19:25.205
You're dead.

20:03.661 --> 20:05.830
By the way, thanks.

20:06.623 --> 20:07.457
For what?

20:07.540 --> 20:09.417
For reminding me why I got into this.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.503
It's been so many years now.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.880
But you never really forget, do you?

20:15.965 --> 20:17.675
No, you don't.

20:17.926 --> 20:18.926
Tell me,

20:19.427 --> 20:21.930
what if you hadn't figured out
how Shriek was using the towers?

20:22.347 --> 20:24.641
Would you have handed yourself
over to him at midnight?

20:25.725 --> 20:27.102
In case you haven't noticed,

20:27.727 --> 20:29.312
we've got a suit to repair here.
