00:45.278 --> 00:46.404
Dog coming through!

00:48.548 --> 00:50.982
Best damn ratter in the town!

01:27.954 --> 01:28.921
All right!
Time!

01:28.988 --> 01:31.354
Walter, Walter!
Fetch the dog.

01:31.424 --> 01:32.823
Philip, count the rats.

01:34.794 --> 01:36.318
That's a good boy.

01:36.396 --> 01:38.057
Come on, boy!
Come on, boy!

01:38.131 --> 01:39.462
Don't forget
that one over there!

01:42.602 --> 01:44.263
That's it, that's it!

01:49.109 --> 01:50.440
59 rats.

01:50.510 --> 01:53.843
We have a surprise upset.
The winner... Flash!

01:53.913 --> 01:54.675
Yes!

01:54.747 --> 01:56.408
You ought to know better
than to mess with

01:56.483 --> 01:58.212
John Delaney's dog, boys!

01:58.318 --> 02:01.412
Hey!
Hey, that's not right!

02:01.454 --> 02:03.046
Hey, hey, hey.

02:03.123 --> 02:07.059
That dog...
That dog was not the best dog.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.889
He had no hindquarters on him.

02:08.961 --> 02:11.829
Anybody who knows
anything about ratting

02:11.898 --> 02:13.627
would never have bet
on that dog!

02:13.700 --> 02:15.167
Hey, what are you implying,
friend?

02:17.170 --> 02:20.298
I was cheated,
and I want my money back!

02:20.373 --> 02:22.603
Hey, hey!
Are you calling me a cheat?

02:24.310 --> 02:26.175
You give me my money!

02:26.246 --> 02:28.874
Give me my money!
Give me my money!

02:28.948 --> 02:30.973
Give me my money!

02:36.456 --> 02:37.787
No charge for that show.

02:37.857 --> 02:40.849
Come on.
Ale and stew in the pub.

02:44.864 --> 02:46.923
Where you going, John?
John.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.763
I've had my fill for the night.

02:48.835 --> 02:52.396
We have to talk.
Come on. We have to talk.

02:52.472 --> 02:54.337
You can go home later.

03:19.332 --> 03:20.526
Ugh!

03:37.951 --> 03:39.543
What do we have, George?

03:39.619 --> 03:41.314
Name is John Delaney.

03:41.387 --> 03:42.752
Seems he was on his way home

03:42.822 --> 03:44.517
from a ratting match
at the Manchester.

03:44.591 --> 03:46.115
Somehow ended up in the river.

03:46.192 --> 03:48.490
Nasty business, that... ratting.

03:48.561 --> 03:51.462
- Who found the body?
- Uh, his son.

03:51.531 --> 03:52.896
Poor soul.

03:57.570 --> 03:59.231
Numerous blows
to the back of the head.

03:59.305 --> 04:01.466
Someone gave him
quite a beating.

04:01.541 --> 04:03.634
Seems Mr. Delaney was a regular
at the matches

04:03.710 --> 04:05.940
and apparently
the big winner tonight.

04:06.012 --> 04:08.310
Right.
Where's the prize money?

04:08.381 --> 04:10.372
No, none, sir.
That's just it.

04:10.450 --> 04:11.678
Robbery, it would seem.

04:11.751 --> 04:13.651
Perhaps.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.119
Over here!

04:15.188 --> 04:16.951
We've found something.

04:19.459 --> 04:21.927
Stinking drunk, this one.

04:21.995 --> 04:24.088
Hey.

04:27.934 --> 04:28.923
I don't know.

04:29.002 --> 04:30.526
By the look of that hand,

04:30.603 --> 04:32.662
I'd say he was
in a bit of a dustup.

04:32.739 --> 04:34.104
Quite possibly.

04:34.173 --> 04:35.538
Oy.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.238
Sir?

04:40.313 --> 04:41.803
Everything all right?

04:44.350 --> 04:45.817
I know this man.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.444
His name is Murdoch.

04:50.423 --> 04:52.152
Murdoch?

04:53.426 --> 04:55.656
Harry Murdoch.

04:55.728 --> 04:57.389
He's my father.

04:59.332 --> 05:01.197
I'd like to be excused
from this case.

05:01.267 --> 05:02.825
Noted.

05:02.902 --> 05:03.869
Denied.

05:03.936 --> 05:06.632
It's highly irregular for a
detective to be investigating

05:06.706 --> 05:08.196
a case involving his own father.

05:08.274 --> 05:10.367
I'm sure he won't receive
any special treatment.

05:10.443 --> 05:12.570
Surely another detective
could handle the case.

05:12.645 --> 05:14.636
You're the only detective
available right now.

05:14.714 --> 05:17.512
If we can't man this case,
we'll have to turn it over

05:17.583 --> 05:19.642
to some private detective
agency, like Pinkerton's.

05:19.719 --> 05:21.516
Perhaps that would be
for the best.

05:21.587 --> 05:23.714
Do you think for one second
that they'll care

05:23.790 --> 05:26.759
how you, your father, or this
police department is portrayed?

05:26.826 --> 05:27.758
Course not.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.954
Listen, we don't
want this business

05:30.029 --> 05:31.656
being made any more public
than need be.

05:31.731 --> 05:32.698
Do you understand?

05:32.765 --> 05:34.426
Sir, I simply doubt
I can remain objective.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.560
- Then be professional.
- But...

05:37.637 --> 05:39.264
Don't you have interviews
to conduct?

05:40.873 --> 05:42.602
Yes, sir.

05:49.582 --> 05:50.879
Shame.

05:50.950 --> 05:52.918
Terrible shame.

05:52.985 --> 05:54.646
John Delaney was one of
my best customers.

05:54.721 --> 05:57.383
Mmh.
Tragic loss for you.

05:58.391 --> 06:00.951
Tell me, Mr. Newcombe,
what happened last night?

06:01.027 --> 06:02.551
Well, the matches, as usual.

06:02.628 --> 06:04.926
Then that business
with the drunken fellow.

06:06.399 --> 06:09.425
This "drunken fellow"...
Was he a regular of yours?

06:09.502 --> 06:11.493
I never laid eyes on him before.

06:11.571 --> 06:13.596
Neither had John,
as far as I could tell.

06:13.673 --> 06:15.766
Did Mr. Delaney
have any enemies?

06:15.842 --> 06:17.366
Not that I'm aware of.

06:17.443 --> 06:20.378
And what did Mr. Delaney do
after the altercation?

06:20.446 --> 06:21.674
He had a quick pint and he left.

06:21.748 --> 06:24.308
His son... uh, Philip?

06:24.384 --> 06:26.477
He found the body.

06:26.552 --> 06:27.610
Came running into the bar

06:27.687 --> 06:29.814
shouting something about his pa
being in a bad way.

06:29.889 --> 06:31.823
No one paid any attention
to it at first.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.552
No? Why not?

06:33.626 --> 06:36.322
Well, the boy...

06:36.396 --> 06:38.159
Once you talk to him,
you'll understand.

06:46.139 --> 06:48.437
Hello, Philip.

06:52.412 --> 06:55.347
My name's
Detective William Murdoch.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.440
I'm very sorry
about your father.

06:58.518 --> 07:00.645
I need to ask you
a few questions.

07:01.988 --> 07:04.047
When you came upon
your father's body,

07:04.123 --> 07:05.522
did you see anything unusual?

07:09.429 --> 07:11.260
Did you hear anything?

07:15.501 --> 07:17.867
You just found his body
in the river?

07:20.206 --> 07:23.107
Was your father
in any sort of trouble?

07:24.110 --> 07:26.442
Was anyone angry with him?

07:29.015 --> 07:31.245
Philip, do you have any idea

07:31.317 --> 07:32.807
what time your father
left the pub?

07:32.885 --> 07:34.512
13 minutes before 10:00.

07:36.889 --> 07:38.686
13 minutes.

07:39.725 --> 07:41.386
What time did you leave the pub?

07:41.461 --> 07:43.554
Four minutes past 10:00.

07:43.629 --> 07:45.426
Four minutes past.
Precisely?

07:48.100 --> 07:50.159
How do you know this?

07:50.236 --> 07:53.171
I see, I see.
That's a very nice watch.

07:54.540 --> 07:57.566
You carry it with you
all the time?

07:57.677 --> 07:59.372
Where did you get your watch,
Philip?

07:59.412 --> 08:00.640
Mrs. Jess.

08:01.647 --> 08:03.308
She... She said it would help me

08:03.382 --> 08:05.475
keep track of things
inside my head.

08:07.920 --> 08:10.218
This is my timepiece.

08:15.895 --> 08:21.128
"For William,
on your birthday, with love. "

08:21.200 --> 08:22.224
Who... Who's Liza?

08:22.301 --> 08:24.394
She was a very special friend
of mine.

08:27.240 --> 08:30.971
Philip, what time did you find
your father's body at the river?

08:31.043 --> 08:32.908
10:22.

08:32.979 --> 08:34.970
That's 18 minutes.

08:36.849 --> 08:37.837
18 minutes.

08:37.917 --> 08:39.908
For you to get
from here to the river.

08:39.986 --> 08:40.953
Yeah.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.010
You're... You're pretty fast
with time,

08:43.089 --> 08:45.114
but... but not really fast
like I am.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.284
No.
Not like you.

08:48.794 --> 08:50.523
What happened
when you got to the river?

08:53.299 --> 08:56.325
It took me one minute
to see that it was my pa.

08:56.402 --> 08:57.926
Then I cried for two minutes.

08:58.037 --> 08:59.698
It took me
another minute to decide

08:59.739 --> 09:01.070
I- I should go back to the pub
and tell.

09:01.140 --> 09:03.108
I ran back.
It took me 11 minutes.

09:03.175 --> 09:04.540
I... I'm... I'm... I'm...

09:04.610 --> 09:08.137
I'm... I'm... I'm not a...
I'm not a very fast runner.

09:08.214 --> 09:10.011
I'm not a very fast writer.

09:12.485 --> 09:13.679
Jess Lacey?

09:14.587 --> 09:17.181
My name's
Detective William Murdoch.

09:17.256 --> 09:20.157
I wonder if I could ask you
a few questions.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.386
Fine.

09:25.364 --> 09:27.730
Your husband...
Walter, is it?

09:27.800 --> 09:29.358
He works for Mr. Newcombe?

09:29.435 --> 09:33.030
Yes. He does odd jobs.
Handles the dogs.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.200
And yourself?

09:35.274 --> 09:38.471
I help out here at the pub,
do some cooking.

09:38.544 --> 09:40.842
I'd like to ask you
about the argument

09:40.913 --> 09:42.710
that Mr. Delaney had last night.

09:42.782 --> 09:44.613
I really didn't see much.

09:44.684 --> 09:46.618
How well did you know
the deceased?

09:47.820 --> 09:50.015
He was just one of the regulars.

09:55.328 --> 09:58.456
Philip is
a very interesting young man.

09:58.531 --> 10:01.989
He barely said a word
till he was almost 12.

10:02.068 --> 10:03.558
Then he just started talking,

10:03.636 --> 10:05.627
like as if
he'd always been able to.

10:05.705 --> 10:08.799
I asked him, "Why didn't you say
anything all those years? "

10:08.874 --> 10:10.068
You know what he said?

10:10.142 --> 10:11.871
"I was listening. "

10:13.879 --> 10:16.575
- And his mother?
- Dead.

10:18.184 --> 10:19.708
Will he be able
to care for himself?

10:19.785 --> 10:21.150
I'll do what I can for him.

10:22.655 --> 10:24.680
I appreciate
the way you were with him.

10:24.757 --> 10:26.622
Others weren't so kind.

10:26.692 --> 10:27.716
Others?

10:28.728 --> 10:30.855
I will not speak ill
of the dead.

10:46.212 --> 10:50.012
You, uh, the detective?

10:50.082 --> 10:52.050
I am.

10:53.185 --> 10:56.712
Well, it's about time
somebody came around,

10:56.822 --> 10:58.949
get me out of this mess.

10:59.925 --> 11:02.393
What makes you think
you're going to get out of it?

11:03.496 --> 11:04.793
Hey.

11:05.798 --> 11:07.322
Do I know you?

11:07.400 --> 11:10.028
No.
No, you don't know me.

11:10.102 --> 11:11.933
Well, anyways...

11:12.972 --> 11:18.171
...I'm gonna tell you
what I told those other coppers.

11:18.244 --> 11:21.270
I did not kill that man.

11:21.347 --> 11:22.644
Why should I believe you?

11:22.715 --> 11:24.683
'Cause I'm telling you so.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.080
You were angry.

11:29.155 --> 11:32.556
You accused the victim of
cheating and attacked him.

11:32.625 --> 11:35.059
Later, the man is found dead,
and you're found nearby.

11:35.127 --> 11:36.856
- How do you explain that?
- Well...

11:41.634 --> 11:42.931
It's all a bit fuzzy.

11:43.002 --> 11:45.402
You were too drunk to remember
how you wound up in the woods.

11:45.471 --> 11:48.133
Maybe you were too drunk
to remember killing Delaney.

11:48.207 --> 11:51.142
I did not kill that man!

11:51.210 --> 11:52.199
No?

11:52.278 --> 11:57.079
How do you know for certain
if you can't remember?

11:58.951 --> 12:01.476
Or maybe you're just lying.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.818
Well, you're not gonna hear

12:03.889 --> 12:06.858
my side of the story at all,
are you?

12:06.926 --> 12:07.915
Hey.

12:08.928 --> 12:10.555
Who are you?

12:10.629 --> 12:14.588
My name is
Detective William Murdoch.

12:15.768 --> 12:17.599
Oh, my god.

12:17.670 --> 12:18.830
Guard.

12:18.904 --> 12:21.031
- William!
- We're finished here.

12:21.107 --> 12:23.405
William!

12:23.476 --> 12:25.467
Willy!

12:25.544 --> 12:27.944
Willy.
Come back!

12:45.364 --> 12:47.491
Will? Willy?

12:48.467 --> 12:51.129
The victim received three deep
blows to the back of the head

12:51.203 --> 12:53.831
consistent with
a blunt, rigid object.

12:53.906 --> 12:56.340
A club, then.
Perhaps a stick of wood.

12:56.408 --> 12:57.875
No, I don't think so.

12:57.977 --> 13:00.468
I would expect to see
traces of wood fiber, dirt.

13:00.513 --> 13:02.037
The cause of death?

13:02.114 --> 13:05.311
There was no trace of water
in the lungs or in the stomach.

13:19.899 --> 13:23.266
So the body was placed
in the water postmortem.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.868
Why would Harry do that?

13:29.708 --> 13:32.142
Perhaps the killer wasn't aware
his victim was dead.

13:32.211 --> 13:33.701
Or he wanted to make sure.

13:33.779 --> 13:36.475
Or perhaps Harry
wanted to make Delaney pay

13:36.549 --> 13:38.881
with some final indignation.

13:41.086 --> 13:42.383
William, there's nothing

13:42.454 --> 13:44.422
linking your father
directly to the murder.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.390
He had motive, means,
and opportunity.

13:46.458 --> 13:48.688
Where's the money
he supposedly stole?

13:48.761 --> 13:51.059
Hidden.
My men are searching for it now.

13:51.130 --> 13:53.894
But that's all
circumstantial evidence.

13:55.768 --> 13:58.293
And I would point out
Delaney was a big man.

13:58.404 --> 14:00.235
Your father was very drunk.

14:00.272 --> 14:03.173
It would seem unlikely that
he could have killed Delaney

14:03.242 --> 14:05.267
and dragged his body
into the river,

14:05.344 --> 14:07.744
hidden the purse, all before
passing out in the woods.

14:07.813 --> 14:09.144
You don't know my father.

14:10.749 --> 14:13.183
William, this must be
very difficult for you.

14:13.252 --> 14:14.776
I'm fine.

14:24.797 --> 14:26.526
It's fantastic.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.499
It's just a drawing.

14:28.567 --> 14:31.536
Uh, no, I mean the boy's mind.
The way it works.

14:31.604 --> 14:34.630
Ah, yes, well, the French
have a term... idiot savant...

14:34.707 --> 14:36.334
meaning a learned idiot.

14:36.408 --> 14:39.309
There are numerous examples
of individuals

14:39.378 --> 14:41.403
who have
been branded simpletons,

14:41.480 --> 14:45.974
however possess, for example,
advanced mathematical skills.

14:46.051 --> 14:47.313
There we go.

14:49.355 --> 14:51.118
Ah, Inspector.
Just in time.

14:51.190 --> 14:53.249
Oh, Jesus, not another chart.

14:53.325 --> 14:55.190
All right, then.
Give me the gist.

14:55.261 --> 14:56.694
- Would you?
- Right.

14:56.795 --> 15:00.492
Harry was kicked out of the
ratting match at 35 past 9:00.

15:00.532 --> 15:03.296
Delaney left the pub
12 minutes later.

15:03.369 --> 15:06.395
Now, Harry is drunk, angry.

15:06.472 --> 15:07.939
Decides to get even.

15:08.007 --> 15:11.465
He follows Delaney
down to the river, kills him.

15:11.543 --> 15:14.637
He then stashes
the winnings somewhere,

15:14.713 --> 15:16.510
crosses the river...

15:17.583 --> 15:19.380
...and passes out in the woods.

15:20.552 --> 15:22.747
Doesn't look very good for
your father. I'm sorry, sir.

15:22.821 --> 15:24.550
Well, this is
all fine and dandy,

15:24.623 --> 15:25.783
but you don't have any proof.

15:25.858 --> 15:27.416
Nothing concrete,
but I can assure you...

15:27.493 --> 15:29.961
Murdoch, you daft bastard,
I'm trying to help you.

15:30.029 --> 15:31.553
Your old man could hang.

15:31.630 --> 15:34.428
Oy, bugalugs, have you got
something you could be doing?

15:34.500 --> 15:35.797
Yes, sir.

15:37.903 --> 15:39.165
A man and his father

15:39.238 --> 15:41.763
might not always see eye-to-eye
on certain matters.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.808
But with something
as serious as this,

15:43.876 --> 15:45.400
you don't want to
be left wondering

15:45.477 --> 15:47.377
if you should have done
something differently.

15:47.446 --> 15:49.380
I'll keep that in mind, sir.

15:49.448 --> 15:52.611
Murdoch,
you're not thinking clearly.

15:52.685 --> 15:56.382
It's plain to see you need
a helping hand, me old mucker.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.980
Have you ever bet on anything
in your life, Murdoch?

15:59.091 --> 16:01.116
- Well...
- No. Thought not.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.685
How's the new tie look?
Could I pass for a dandy?

16:03.762 --> 16:05.696
- Very sharp, sir. Very sharp.
- Good.

16:05.764 --> 16:08.460
Now, I've spent time at various
race courses around the world.

16:08.534 --> 16:09.796
You get to hear stories,

16:09.868 --> 16:12.268
a little pepper on the arse,
stuff like that.

16:12.338 --> 16:14.363
I'm not sure of the connection
to the case, sir.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.431
Well, if the ratting matches
were fixed,

16:16.508 --> 16:19.136
suddenly we've got a roomful
of losers, all with motive.

16:19.211 --> 16:20.610
That'll work
in your father's favor.

16:20.679 --> 16:23.147
Now all we have to do is
find out how they're doing it.

16:23.215 --> 16:24.739
Shouldn't we get
a search warrant?

16:24.817 --> 16:26.341
A mere technicality.

16:26.418 --> 16:29.080
Watch and learn, Murdoch.
Watch and learn.

16:30.356 --> 16:32.483
She was 50 yards behind
at the quarter.

16:32.558 --> 16:34.389
It was all over
but the shouting.

16:34.460 --> 16:36.155
Then when they hit
the final stretch,

16:36.228 --> 16:37.855
that's when she made her move.

16:37.930 --> 16:40.023
It was as if
all those other raggedy-ass nags

16:40.099 --> 16:41.726
were standing still.

16:58.917 --> 17:00.908
Then in '90
when I was at the Derby...

17:00.986 --> 17:02.544
- The Kentucky Derby?
- Mmh.

17:02.621 --> 17:05.488
- You were there?
- Yes. Glorious day.

17:05.557 --> 17:07.525
I thought the track
was muddy that year.

17:07.593 --> 17:09.151
The track.
It was muddy that year.

17:10.429 --> 17:12.795
I think you're right, yeah.
Don't know what I was thinking.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.662
Slick.
Terribly slick.

17:20.839 --> 17:22.170
I took one look at Kingman,

17:22.241 --> 17:23.935
and I knew that was
the horse to beat.

17:24.009 --> 17:27.376
Wasn't it Riley that won?
Kingman took it the next year.

17:28.580 --> 17:31.344
Now, dogs...
That's my one true love.

17:31.417 --> 17:33.647
- What's got into them?
- It's probably just a barn cat.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.653
Anyway, I was no more than
a young pup myself

17:35.721 --> 17:38.554
when my father took me to
a greyhound meeting in Wales.

17:57.242 --> 17:59.836
The Welsh just love their dogs.

17:59.878 --> 18:02.142
Bartender!
Another beer, please.

18:02.214 --> 18:03.909
Walter, see what
has those dogs riled up.

18:03.982 --> 18:05.108
It's probably nothing.

18:05.184 --> 18:08.813
Ever been to Wales?
Barren but majestic.

18:10.956 --> 18:12.253
Aah!

18:14.093 --> 18:16.027
What the hell
is going on in here?

18:20.432 --> 18:22.332
Someone in here?

18:26.772 --> 18:29.935
Show yourself or you're getting
it upside the head.

18:46.525 --> 18:49.255
- Chloral hydrate in tincture.
- Chloroform.

18:49.328 --> 18:51.796
- This is opium in tincture.
- Laudanum.

18:51.864 --> 18:53.832
And cocaine in tincture.

18:55.267 --> 18:56.996
Two sedatives and one stimulant.

18:57.102 --> 19:00.071
The dogs were being drugged.
Your father is correct.

19:00.105 --> 19:02.130
So it appears.

19:03.509 --> 19:07.036
Perhaps he's telling the truth
about the murder as well.

19:08.013 --> 19:11.312
William, you seem single-minded
about your father's guilt.

19:11.383 --> 19:12.645
I'm no such thing.

19:13.652 --> 19:14.880
In any other case

19:14.953 --> 19:17.683
you would thoroughly investigate
all possibilities

19:17.756 --> 19:20.020
before assuming
a suspect's guilt.

19:20.092 --> 19:23.084
And surely your father
deserves the same treatment.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.995
My father deserves nothing.

19:37.109 --> 19:39.907
Why don't you
ever look after that kid?!

19:39.978 --> 19:41.036
Don't you...

19:50.622 --> 19:51.884
So how do they do it?

19:51.957 --> 19:54.824
Well, you, uh...

19:56.028 --> 19:57.791
...slip the favorite...

19:58.864 --> 20:00.957
...a little sleeping potion.

20:01.033 --> 20:04.628
And, uh, that'll take the starch
out of his Nebuchadnezzar.

20:05.637 --> 20:07.764
Then the crowd bets
the favorite,

20:07.839 --> 20:10.273
and the house cleans up
on the underdog.

20:10.342 --> 20:11.366
So...

20:11.443 --> 20:14.469
Will you be releasing me?

20:14.546 --> 20:16.275
No.

20:16.348 --> 20:19.215
The fact that there was cheating
just confirms your motive.

20:21.920 --> 20:26.823
It's a terrible thing when a boy
distrusts his father so much.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.154
Yes.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.286
And whose fault would that be?

20:31.597 --> 20:35.897
After the nuns took you,
I meant to write you.

20:35.968 --> 20:37.595
But I never knew where.

20:38.470 --> 20:40.028
Well, that would have
been difficult.

20:40.105 --> 20:43.472
I know.
I should have found you.

20:44.276 --> 20:46.801
But, um, well...

20:47.980 --> 20:49.914
...you wouldn't have liked
the man I become.

20:49.982 --> 20:53.247
As opposed to the upstanding
citizen you are now.

20:55.687 --> 20:57.120
Willy.

20:57.222 --> 20:59.520
Why are you really here?

20:59.558 --> 21:02.686
- For the truth.
- Well, I t-told you the truth.

21:02.761 --> 21:06.094
I did not kill that man.

21:06.164 --> 21:08.029
We both very well know

21:08.100 --> 21:10.227
what you're capable of
when you've been drinking.

21:11.637 --> 21:14.731
What?
What are you talking about?

21:14.806 --> 21:18.173
You know precisely
what I'm talking about.

21:23.715 --> 21:25.740
Let's go over this again,
Mr. Lacey.

21:25.817 --> 21:29.014
Why do you have chloroform,
laudanum, and cocaine

21:29.087 --> 21:30.179
in your kennel?

21:30.255 --> 21:32.416
There's nothing illegal
about them.

21:32.491 --> 21:34.152
Maybe not.

21:34.226 --> 21:35.921
But I think your boss
and his clientele

21:35.994 --> 21:37.120
might have something to say

21:37.195 --> 21:39.288
if they discovered
you were drugging the dogs.

21:39.364 --> 21:40.922
Wouldn't they, George?

21:40.999 --> 21:44.127
What if word were to get out?
Accidentally, sir.

21:44.202 --> 21:46.693
I don't see how that's possible.
Only you and I know.

21:46.772 --> 21:48.831
But if it did.

21:48.907 --> 21:51.034
Here's how it looks to me...

21:51.109 --> 21:53.373
Doping the dogs was easy.

21:53.445 --> 21:56.471
But you needed a partner.
Someone to lay the bets.

21:56.548 --> 21:57.981
Delaney.

21:58.083 --> 22:00.278
But something happened between
the two of you, didn't it?

22:00.319 --> 22:02.480
- Maybe over the cut.
- Look...

22:03.388 --> 22:06.118
I didn't have anything to do
with Delaney getting killed.

22:07.726 --> 22:09.284
I just doped the animals
for them.

22:10.595 --> 22:11.527
"Them"?

22:11.596 --> 22:14.190
Delaney and Newcombe.

22:14.266 --> 22:16.496
They came up
with the doping scheme.

22:30.382 --> 22:32.009
Hello, Philip.

22:36.221 --> 22:37.950
Have you seen Mr. Newcombe?

22:38.023 --> 22:39.923
He left.

22:39.991 --> 22:41.515
T- Twelve minutes ago.

22:41.593 --> 22:43.788
Twelve minutes ago.
Thank you.

22:46.598 --> 22:47.622
Philip...

22:49.801 --> 22:52.326
Did you see Mr. Newcombe
and your father together

22:52.404 --> 22:53.894
that night after the matches?

22:53.972 --> 22:55.530
Yes.

22:55.607 --> 22:57.097
Oh, you did?

22:58.710 --> 23:01.508
And what were they doing,
Philip?

23:01.580 --> 23:03.707
They were
in Mr. Newcombe's office.

23:03.782 --> 23:05.977
Just leave me be!
Leave me!

23:06.051 --> 23:07.348
They were yelling at each other.

23:07.419 --> 23:09.410
And what are you staring at,
you great-eyed...

23:09.488 --> 23:11.854
You will not be striking
your son.

23:18.029 --> 23:19.553
Philip?

23:20.665 --> 23:22.633
What time did this argument
take place?

23:22.701 --> 23:24.259
A quarter to 10:00.

23:25.937 --> 23:27.131
And Mr. Newcombe...

23:27.205 --> 23:29.196
What time did he leave the pub

23:29.274 --> 23:30.571
the night
your father was killed?

23:30.642 --> 23:32.439
Four minutes before 10:00.

23:33.311 --> 23:35.575
Well, Philip,
thank you very much.

23:35.647 --> 23:37.638
You've been very helpful.

23:37.716 --> 23:39.911
- I have?
- You have.

23:40.919 --> 23:43.114
When... When I...
When I tried to help before,

23:43.188 --> 23:44.621
my pa said I was stupid.

23:45.924 --> 23:47.755
Well, he was very wrong
to say that.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.523
Very wrong.

24:01.907 --> 24:05.866
Delaney and Newcombe
have their argument...

24:07.145 --> 24:09.875
...at quarter to 10:00.

24:09.948 --> 24:11.848
Delaney leaves the pub
two minutes later.

24:11.917 --> 24:16.616
Now, we know it's an 18-minute
walk to the crime scene...

24:17.856 --> 24:20.950
...which puts the murder...

24:24.329 --> 24:29.357
...at around
five minutes after 10:00.

24:30.402 --> 24:33.303
However, we know Newcombe...

24:34.906 --> 24:41.072
...left the pub
at four minutes to 10:00.

24:42.080 --> 24:46.414
Then he only had nine minutes
to get to the crime scene.

24:50.355 --> 24:51.617
Exactly.

24:52.924 --> 24:54.357
Could he have made it?

25:11.009 --> 25:12.340
Well?

25:13.445 --> 25:15.470
If I take an average
of your five runs...

25:15.547 --> 25:17.913
allowing for
superior conditioning,

25:17.983 --> 25:20.417
now compensated for
by exhaustion...

25:20.485 --> 25:23.113
Let's see.
Seven...

25:24.723 --> 25:27.624
It's quite possible
to make it here in nine minutes.

25:28.994 --> 25:30.859
Right, then.
Once again.

25:33.064 --> 25:35.157
You and Delaney were arguing.

25:35.233 --> 25:37.724
Maybe you wanted
a bigger cut of the winnings.

25:37.802 --> 25:39.565
Delaney disagreed.

25:39.638 --> 25:43.005
Or maybe you wanted
the entire purse for yourself.

25:43.074 --> 25:45.235
So you followed him
down to the river and took it.

25:46.344 --> 25:49.074
That's fantastic.
Brilliant.

25:49.147 --> 25:50.171
Wrong.

25:50.248 --> 25:51.977
All right.
Correct me, then.

25:53.118 --> 25:55.279
We did argue.
It wasn't over the money.

25:55.353 --> 25:56.615
What was it over, then?

25:57.956 --> 25:59.856
John was getting greedy.

25:59.925 --> 26:01.722
He wanted to run the con again
right away.

26:01.793 --> 26:04.728
I wanted to stop. I thought the
fixes were becoming too obvious.

26:05.797 --> 26:07.458
So your partner
was becoming a problem.

26:08.366 --> 26:10.630
- Is that why you killed him?
- I didn't kill him.

26:11.770 --> 26:13.533
Why did you leave the pub early
that night?

26:13.605 --> 26:15.368
It was a long day.

26:15.440 --> 26:17.601
I went home.
I left Walter to close up.

26:17.676 --> 26:18.938
And which way is home?

26:20.312 --> 26:23.076
- It's past the river.
- The same as Delaney.

26:23.148 --> 26:25.082
Yes.

26:25.150 --> 26:27.050
And did you see the body?

26:29.054 --> 26:30.282
No.

26:41.032 --> 26:42.021
Sir?

26:43.668 --> 26:46.034
There's no way Newcombe
missed seeing the body

26:46.104 --> 26:47.469
when he passed by.

26:47.539 --> 26:49.302
Well, then, he's lying.

26:49.374 --> 26:51.274
Yes.
Could be.

26:51.343 --> 26:53.538
But I'm much more interested
in the possibility

26:53.612 --> 26:55.341
that he could be
telling the truth.

26:55.413 --> 26:56.607
Sir?

26:56.715 --> 26:58.842
Think about it, George.

26:58.883 --> 27:01.215
If Newcombe left the pub
after Delaney

27:01.286 --> 27:04.380
but never did see his body
when he came across the river...

27:05.423 --> 27:09.086
Then Delaney wasn't there at
that time... He was still alive.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.526
Very good, George.
And if that's the case, then...

27:11.596 --> 27:12.961
Then where was he?

27:14.366 --> 27:17.597
We have to find out
what John Delaney was up to

27:17.669 --> 27:19.330
during those missing moments

27:19.404 --> 27:21.895
and if that's the reason
he was murdered.

27:29.481 --> 27:32.006
You showing up here
hasn't made my life any easier.

27:32.083 --> 27:36.076
Well, hasn't worked out
so well for me neither.

27:36.154 --> 27:38.622
If that's the case, then you'd
better start remembering

27:38.690 --> 27:40.021
something about that night.

27:40.091 --> 27:41.854
Did you see Delaney
leave the pub?

27:41.926 --> 27:44.588
Uh... Uh, I...
Eh, I can't remember.

27:44.663 --> 27:47.097
Think!
Did you see anything?

27:47.165 --> 27:48.962
I was... I was drunk,
I tell you.

27:49.034 --> 27:51.832
Oh, for God's sake, man,
stop using that excuse.

27:51.903 --> 27:53.700
It's your neck.

27:53.772 --> 27:57.071
Will, what do you
got against me?

27:57.175 --> 28:00.667
You've got the gall to ask me
that after what you did to her?

28:00.712 --> 28:03.840
She drowned.
You know that.

28:03.915 --> 28:06.179
Do you know
what a concussion is?

28:07.185 --> 28:09.881
It's a medical term describing
a lingering brain injury

28:09.954 --> 28:11.353
caused by a blow to the head.

28:11.423 --> 28:13.357
It causes dizziness
and faintness.

28:13.425 --> 28:14.687
If you hadn't hit her,

28:14.759 --> 28:16.784
she never would have
fallen into the water.

28:17.796 --> 28:19.627
Well, you seem to know
so much about it.

28:19.698 --> 28:22.098
Why don't you tell me
what happened?

28:23.835 --> 28:25.166
All right.

28:28.306 --> 28:29.603
You came home drunk.

28:31.142 --> 28:35.169
You started laying into me for
making a mess of the firewood.

28:39.584 --> 28:41.575
Right, right.

28:41.653 --> 28:44.087
Oh, are you having fun, huh?
Huh?

28:44.155 --> 28:47.124
Don't you touch him,
you bloody drunk!

28:47.192 --> 28:48.386
Mother tried to stop you.

28:48.460 --> 28:50.587
I'm gonna take him,
and we're leaving!

28:51.763 --> 28:54.027
- Go on and hit me!
- Mom!

28:54.099 --> 28:56.727
You're disgusting!
Don't you...

28:56.835 --> 28:57.859
You hit her.

28:57.902 --> 28:59.597
Mom!

29:01.539 --> 29:04.030
She was only trying
to protect me.

29:06.678 --> 29:07.940
Will...

29:09.380 --> 29:12.213
That's not what happened.

29:12.283 --> 29:14.114
Now, you let me explain.

29:14.185 --> 29:16.517
When I came home
that night, you...

29:16.588 --> 29:18.556
W- What?

29:18.623 --> 29:21.490
Surely a-any police officer
worth his salt

29:21.559 --> 29:24.687
would be interested in hearing
the other side of the story.

29:24.763 --> 29:27.823
Will? Willy?

29:27.899 --> 29:29.127
Willy!

29:33.571 --> 29:36.870
Oh, Dr. Ogden was by earlier.
She left that note for you.

29:38.843 --> 29:40.970
Oh, well,
I guess I'll be leaving, sir.

29:46.317 --> 29:48.615
And out.

29:49.487 --> 29:51.421
And in.

29:51.489 --> 29:52.751
Out.

29:53.758 --> 29:55.453
And in.

29:55.527 --> 29:56.994
And out.

29:58.329 --> 29:59.523
Last one. In.

30:01.432 --> 30:02.524
And out.

30:03.735 --> 30:04.861
Very good.

30:05.770 --> 30:06.930
I'll see you next week.

30:13.211 --> 30:15.145
Breathing exercises, eh?

30:15.213 --> 30:18.205
Meant to strengthen the lungs
and help ward off consumption.

30:18.283 --> 30:20.683
If you believe the experts.

30:20.752 --> 30:22.811
Well, it can't hurt.

30:22.887 --> 30:25.481
Dr. Ogden.

30:25.557 --> 30:27.616
Julia.

30:27.692 --> 30:30.320
I've been
somewhat distracted recently.

30:30.395 --> 30:31.657
Even rude at times.

30:31.729 --> 30:36.132
Perhaps this case has affected
me more than I care to admit.

30:36.201 --> 30:37.725
Is that an apology?

30:39.103 --> 30:40.934
A very awkward one, but yes.

30:42.373 --> 30:43.931
Apology accepted.

30:44.843 --> 30:47.038
I reexamined Delaney
as you requested,

30:47.111 --> 30:48.840
keeping an eye out for anything
out of the ordinary.

30:48.913 --> 30:51.882
The only thing I found was
a small abrasion on his penis.

30:51.950 --> 30:54.077
It appeared to be recent.

30:55.653 --> 30:58.019
That might explain
where he disappeared to.

30:58.122 --> 30:59.453
What do you mean?

31:00.592 --> 31:01.718
There's an unexplained gap

31:01.793 --> 31:03.351
between when Delaney
left the bar

31:03.428 --> 31:06.761
and when his body
ended up in the river.

31:06.831 --> 31:08.264
Perhaps he had a rendezvous.

31:09.667 --> 31:12.067
I would suggest a vigorous one.

31:21.079 --> 31:23.138
Yeah, John always had
an eye for the ladies.

31:23.214 --> 31:24.977
Anyone in particular?

31:26.651 --> 31:27.811
I don't like to gossip.

31:27.886 --> 31:30.411
I remind you, you are not yet
beyond suspicion.

31:33.992 --> 31:36.586
I think he was
sniffing around Jess Lacey.

31:42.133 --> 31:43.794
I already told you.

31:43.868 --> 31:46.996
I didn't have anything to do
with Delaney's murder.

31:47.071 --> 31:48.800
I had nothing against the man.

31:48.873 --> 31:51.000
No?
Not even jealousy?

31:51.075 --> 31:53.669
Why would I be jealous?

31:53.745 --> 31:56.179
The man was after your wife.

31:56.247 --> 31:57.544
What?

31:57.649 --> 32:00.311
We already know John Delaney
had sexual relations

32:00.351 --> 32:02.216
just shortly before
he was killed.

32:03.388 --> 32:06.915
Did you happen upon them in the
act, fly into a jealous rage?

32:06.991 --> 32:09.357
- She would never.
- Some men wouldn't blame you.

32:09.427 --> 32:12.453
Look, I didn't kill Delaney,
all right?

32:12.530 --> 32:16.193
But if I found him with Jess,
I might have.

32:40.425 --> 32:42.188
Blood, Mr. Lacey?

32:43.528 --> 32:45.189
From the rats.

32:47.065 --> 32:48.532
We shall see.

32:54.806 --> 32:57.832
Dr. Ogden,
I need your assistance.

32:57.942 --> 32:59.773
Are we going to kill something?

32:59.811 --> 33:00.743
Oh. Sorry.

33:00.812 --> 33:01.904
I need to determine

33:01.980 --> 33:04.210
whether the blood on this
is human or animal.

33:04.282 --> 33:06.216
That's not possible.

33:06.284 --> 33:08.809
Actually, I've been doing
some reading.

33:12.890 --> 33:15.188
- A little room.
- Sorry.

33:16.327 --> 33:18.318
Could you pass me those vials?

33:19.464 --> 33:21.762
So if the antibodies
in the rabbit serum

33:21.833 --> 33:23.596
react to the human blood cells,

33:23.668 --> 33:25.329
then a visible line
should appear

33:25.403 --> 33:28.304
across the middle of the slides
when the two solutions meet.

33:29.374 --> 33:31.365
So you came across this process
in your readings?

33:31.442 --> 33:32.932
Yes.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.603
No matter how many books I read,

33:34.679 --> 33:37.842
I never seem to find anything
as fascinating as yours.

33:39.584 --> 33:41.984
So will this evidence
stand up in court?

33:42.053 --> 33:45.284
I only need enough evidence
to satisfy myself.

33:57.769 --> 34:00.294
Tearing the place apart!
You have no right!

34:00.338 --> 34:02.499
Right, sir.
Here we are.

34:06.444 --> 34:09.139
I found this stuffed
under some burlap sacks.

34:12.750 --> 34:15.241
First the murder weapon,
and now the prize money.

34:15.319 --> 34:18.219
That's justification enough to
tear this place apart, I'd say.

34:18.289 --> 34:20.449
I have no idea
how that got in here.

34:20.525 --> 34:23.619
George, we'll have to take
Mr. Lacey down to the station.

34:23.694 --> 34:26.356
But I didn't do it.
I don't understand.

34:26.431 --> 34:28.194
There'll be no need for that.

34:28.266 --> 34:30.063
Mrs. Lacey?

34:30.134 --> 34:31.726
My husband is innocent,
Detective.

34:31.803 --> 34:32.963
What makes you so certain?

34:33.971 --> 34:36.132
Because I killed John Delaney.

34:50.621 --> 34:52.521
Tell me, Mrs. Lacey,
what happened?

34:55.159 --> 34:57.889
He started coming to me
after the matches.

34:59.564 --> 35:01.998
I made it clear to him
that I wasn't interested.

35:05.203 --> 35:07.228
That night, he didn't take no
for an answer.

35:07.305 --> 35:10.536
He left me lying on the ground
like so much dirt.

35:12.310 --> 35:14.369
Something in me snapped.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.972
I caught up with him
at the river.

35:19.717 --> 35:22.311
I hit him hard.

35:25.590 --> 35:27.615
And how did he end up
in the water?

35:27.692 --> 35:30.490
He was laying there.

35:30.561 --> 35:32.324
Still breathing.

35:34.665 --> 35:37.600
I couldn't bring myself
to strike him again,

35:37.668 --> 35:39.533
so I pushed him in.

35:50.047 --> 35:52.106
And let the water
finish him off?

35:53.618 --> 35:54.778
Yes.

35:58.789 --> 36:00.154
And the money?

36:00.224 --> 36:02.317
I took it.

36:02.393 --> 36:05.829
To make it look like a robbery.
I hid it above the dog kennel.

36:07.265 --> 36:09.563
I'll sign the papers
for your father's release.

36:09.634 --> 36:11.329
You can deliver
the good news yourself.

36:11.402 --> 36:13.302
I would never have put her
in the frame for it.

36:13.371 --> 36:15.566
Maybe that's because
she didn't kill John Delaney.

36:15.640 --> 36:18.302
Murdoch!
What are you talking about?

36:18.376 --> 36:20.071
- The woman just confessed.
- She's lying.

36:20.144 --> 36:22.408
She claims to have put
Delaney's body in the river

36:22.480 --> 36:23.970
while he was still breathing.

36:24.048 --> 36:25.709
But we know he was already dead.

36:26.851 --> 36:28.842
Why would she put her own neck
in the noose?

36:28.920 --> 36:31.855
I've been asking myself
the same question.

36:31.923 --> 36:34.357
The answer's in the timeline.

36:34.425 --> 36:37.588
Philip.
I need your help.

36:37.662 --> 36:38.754
My help?

36:38.829 --> 36:41.627
Mm-hmm.
With the times.

36:41.699 --> 36:44.600
You see,
I've been over and over them.

36:44.669 --> 36:47.194
I still can't quite make sense
of one thing.

36:48.873 --> 36:51.273
Here's the problem, Philip.

36:51.342 --> 36:53.537
Mrs. Jess.

36:53.611 --> 36:56.375
She's confessed
to killing your father.

36:57.815 --> 36:59.077
No.

37:01.652 --> 37:04.382
She says she killed him here
by the river

37:04.455 --> 37:07.015
and then returned to the pub.

37:07.091 --> 37:12.495
But if you were on this path,
as you say you were,

37:12.563 --> 37:14.758
then surely
you must have seen her.

37:16.634 --> 37:17.464
No.

37:17.535 --> 37:18.797
You kept such careful track

37:18.869 --> 37:21.360
of when everyone else
came and went that night.

37:22.440 --> 37:25.637
What about Mrs. Jess?
When did she leave?

37:25.710 --> 37:26.734
When did she return?

37:26.811 --> 37:28.972
- I... I don... I don't know.
- You don't know?

37:29.046 --> 37:30.411
How can you not know?

37:30.481 --> 37:31.743
You kept such careful track

37:31.816 --> 37:33.977
of everyone's comings and goings
that night.

37:34.051 --> 37:35.575
But not hers?

37:35.653 --> 37:37.848
The one person
who cares for you?

37:41.659 --> 37:43.559
What if something
happened to her?

37:44.462 --> 37:46.794
What if someone
had been trying to hurt her?

37:46.864 --> 37:48.161
Philip!

37:49.166 --> 37:51.430
Is that what happened, Philip?

37:51.502 --> 37:54.369
Did you see someone hurting her?

37:57.942 --> 37:59.705
I know what it's like...

38:01.579 --> 38:05.777
...when you want to protect
someone you love so much,

38:05.850 --> 38:07.408
but you can't.

38:10.621 --> 38:13.021
I know how angry
that can make you.

38:15.226 --> 38:17.160
Is that what happened, Philip?

38:33.577 --> 38:35.169
How could you do that to him?!

38:35.246 --> 38:36.577
And I will keep at it,
Mrs. Lacey,

38:36.647 --> 38:38.410
until you tell me the truth.

38:41.285 --> 38:44.220
How about I tell you what
I think happened that night?

38:45.523 --> 38:47.582
Delaney did attack you.

38:48.592 --> 38:50.082
But Philip happened by.

38:53.064 --> 38:54.497
He saw everything.

38:55.533 --> 38:58.400
The man
who should have loved him

38:58.502 --> 39:01.164
had harmed the only person
in the world who did.

39:03.474 --> 39:05.408
He was enraged.

39:07.712 --> 39:09.475
So he followed his father.

39:14.518 --> 39:16.486
I should have stopped him.

39:18.422 --> 39:20.686
Only when I came upon him...

39:21.525 --> 39:23.049
Oh!

39:23.127 --> 39:25.118
No!

39:26.030 --> 39:28.089
No.

39:29.767 --> 39:31.962
Philip.

39:32.036 --> 39:34.527
Oh, God.
Why didn't I stop him?

39:39.110 --> 39:40.407
Sometimes I wonder if I didn't

39:40.478 --> 39:43.606
because I wanted John dead
so badly.

39:43.681 --> 39:45.512
For what he'd done to you.

39:47.118 --> 39:48.551
To Philip.

39:52.156 --> 39:53.851
What'll become of him?

39:55.426 --> 39:56.893
I don't know.

40:01.932 --> 40:04.457
Maybe he'll be better off
without his father.

40:10.274 --> 40:11.866
May I see him?

40:12.710 --> 40:14.109
Yes.

40:22.153 --> 40:23.518
Philip.

40:24.688 --> 40:26.747
Philip.

40:26.824 --> 40:30.021
I... I... I-I think
I- I said something

40:30.094 --> 40:31.789
I wasn't supposed to, Mrs. Jess.

40:31.862 --> 40:35.093
Oh, no.
No. You didn't.

40:35.166 --> 40:37.327
You were so good.

40:37.401 --> 40:40.063
You were so good.

40:40.137 --> 40:41.729
So good.

40:57.521 --> 41:00.149
You come to see me off?

41:01.859 --> 41:04.259
I thought not.

41:04.328 --> 41:07.388
You say it happened differently.

41:07.465 --> 41:09.296
Yeah.

41:09.366 --> 41:10.458
Tell me.

41:12.002 --> 41:13.594
All right.

41:16.373 --> 41:19.274
You had made a mess
of the woodpile.

41:19.343 --> 41:22.073
I come home, and I was drinking.

41:22.146 --> 41:25.343
And it doesn't take much
to set a drinker off.

41:25.416 --> 41:28.977
Your mother protected you.

41:29.053 --> 41:31.180
She always loved you.

41:31.255 --> 41:34.418
You know that, don't you?

41:35.392 --> 41:37.952
Well, she had a sharp tongue.

41:38.028 --> 41:40.929
I didn't.
We were a poor match.

41:40.998 --> 41:43.523
But that day was the worst.

41:43.601 --> 41:47.833
She... She threatened to
leave me and take you with her.

41:47.905 --> 41:52.899
And I don't think I've ever been
so angry in my life.

41:52.977 --> 41:56.469
But I never hit her.

41:59.250 --> 42:01.650
She come at me.

42:01.719 --> 42:04.779
You are pathetic, Harry!

42:04.855 --> 42:06.413
- She slipped.
- Oh!

42:07.591 --> 42:09.491
And, she, uh...

42:09.560 --> 42:12.461
She hit her head on the hearth.

42:12.530 --> 42:14.657
You all right?

42:20.437 --> 42:21.597
You never hit her?

42:22.873 --> 42:24.534
No.

42:24.608 --> 42:27.736
I never hit her.

42:30.781 --> 42:32.043
Why should I believe you?

42:34.952 --> 42:38.217
Do you ever remember me
hitting you?

42:39.690 --> 42:41.851
No. You don't.

42:41.926 --> 42:44.087
Because I never did.

42:44.161 --> 42:46.721
I've done a lot of things wrong
in my life,

42:46.797 --> 42:50.096
but I never hit my boy.

42:52.036 --> 42:53.799
Or my wife.

42:54.872 --> 42:58.774
I know this may be hard
for you to believe...

42:59.777 --> 43:01.870
I loved her.

43:10.254 --> 43:13.121
Well...

43:13.190 --> 43:17.456
I guess, uh, I'd best be off.

43:21.565 --> 43:23.430
Where will you go?

43:23.500 --> 43:28.494
They say, uh, a lot of
good opportunities out West.

44:03.273 --> 44:06.333
I thought you might like to see
today's newspaper.

44:06.410 --> 44:08.401
It would seem the paper
is intent

44:08.479 --> 44:10.538
on building public sentiment
behind Philip.

44:10.614 --> 44:12.980
It will likely save him
from the gallows.

44:16.453 --> 44:18.250
I thought you'd be pleased.

44:19.189 --> 44:21.054
I am. I am.
It's just...

44:21.125 --> 44:24.617
Did things not go well
with your father?

44:24.695 --> 44:26.993
I have a lot to think about.

44:28.532 --> 44:31.399
I find Toronto Island
a- a lovely place to go

44:31.468 --> 44:32.526
when I need to think.

44:32.603 --> 44:35.163
A walk along the shoreline
is most relaxing.

44:35.239 --> 44:37.799
Are you offering
to accompany me, Doctor?

44:38.776 --> 44:41.176
Well, you have been
rather confused of late.

44:41.245 --> 44:44.578
I wouldn't want you to get lost
among the lagoons.

44:44.648 --> 44:46.138
Excellent.
