<i> Oh, I'm so nervous</i>

00:36.186 --> 00:37.778
to see where I got assigned
for Careers Week.

00:37.930 --> 00:39.204
I promise you from
the bottom of my heart

00:39.356 --> 00:41.540
that I will support your
arbitrarily assigned career

00:41.767 --> 00:43.208
-no matter what.
-DRAMA JOHN: Oh, my God.

00:43.360 --> 00:44.859
I got The Bean Factory?

00:44.879 --> 00:46.361
I can't believe
I signed up for that

00:46.380 --> 00:48.939
just so I could be angry
when I got it. Ah!

00:48.957 --> 00:51.108
(gasps)
I got my first choice!

00:51.126 --> 00:52.609
MommaPoppa's Ristorante?

00:52.702 --> 00:54.553
"Tastes so nice,
you want to eat it twice."

00:54.780 --> 00:57.539
I can't believe you'll be
working with Noodie the Noodle.

00:57.633 --> 00:58.557
Who's Noodie the Noodle?

00:58.708 --> 00:59.874
Oh, the restaurant's mascot.

00:59.894 --> 01:02.377
A person-sized noodle
who walks around.

01:02.471 --> 01:03.954
He's ruffled my hair
a time or two.

01:04.047 --> 01:06.732
If a giant noodle touched my
hair, I would shoot it on sight.

01:06.959 --> 01:08.125
I love the beaded curtain

01:08.143 --> 01:09.551
you walk through to go
to the restrooms.

01:09.686 --> 01:11.461
And the children's
six-piece jigsaw puzzle

01:11.480 --> 01:12.237
at every table.

01:12.464 --> 01:13.772
Who doesn't love
to see a rooster

01:13.999 --> 01:15.074
come together like that?

01:15.301 --> 01:16.466
Oh, and you'll love it,

01:16.485 --> 01:17.910
you always get
a huge bowl of free pasta

01:18.061 --> 01:19.561
with whatever entree you order.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.063
It's always served at
exactly my body temperature,

01:22.157 --> 01:23.657
so I can hardly feel it
passing through me.

01:23.809 --> 01:25.992
Oh, my favorite thing is
their famous dessert cart.

01:26.087 --> 01:28.312
Ah, it would be a dream
to have one of my desserts

01:28.405 --> 01:29.646
ride the dessert cart.

01:29.665 --> 01:32.816
Immortalized in colorful plastic
for all eternity.

01:32.909 --> 01:35.485
Yeah, I don't suppose
anyone's interested in the<i> scoop</i>

01:35.579 --> 01:37.930
on where I'll be working,
but the<i> headline</i> is...

01:38.157 --> 01:40.748
Are you perhaps working
at the newspaper, Judith?

01:40.843 --> 01:42.159
Ooh, great guess, Moon!

01:42.177 --> 01:43.769
But I'll be doing
the reporting here. (chuckles)

01:43.920 --> 01:45.253
Yes, I'll be working
at the paper.

01:45.347 --> 01:47.180
And I'll be hosting
our first student

01:47.274 --> 01:48.498
aboard<i> The Mighty Kathleen.</i>

01:48.517 --> 01:50.792
My protégé is
a young woman named Bethany.

01:50.794 --> 01:52.111
You've met Bethany, remember?

01:52.338 --> 01:54.187
She got my 11th birthday party
at Cheese Wagon cancelled

01:54.340 --> 01:56.022
because she brought me
a dead bird as a gift?

01:56.175 --> 01:58.450
Well, a dead bird
is a great reminder

01:58.602 --> 01:59.767
of the fragility of life.

01:59.862 --> 02:01.120
With any hope,
she'll be as excited

02:01.271 --> 02:03.530
to receive lasting knowledge
of commercial fishing

02:03.682 --> 02:04.939
as I am to impart it.

02:04.959 --> 02:06.700
And Wolf, Honeybee,
and Moon will be there

02:06.794 --> 02:08.034
to help me show her the ropes.

02:08.187 --> 02:09.703
Literally.
I got those new ropes

02:09.797 --> 02:11.204
last week in Death Cliff.

02:11.357 --> 02:12.947
Oh, yeah!
Those ropes are sick!

02:12.967 --> 02:14.282
Well, I think it's great
you guys get

02:14.376 --> 02:15.950
to test out your dream jobs

02:16.044 --> 02:17.711
and see if they're as cool
as you thought they would be.

02:17.863 --> 02:19.863
My dream job is to be a
personal shopper for the stars.

02:19.882 --> 02:22.224
Can you imagine going to Kroger
for Nicole Kidman?

02:24.961 --> 02:26.536
(gasps) Oh, you must be Ham.

02:26.555 --> 02:29.373
Oh, my God,
look at this handsome boy.

02:29.466 --> 02:30.223
Poppa, Poppa!

02:30.376 --> 02:32.133
Get out here.
Ham's here!

02:32.227 --> 02:34.378
(gasps) Oh, my God!

02:34.396 --> 02:35.687
Is this boy an angel, Momma?

02:35.914 --> 02:37.138
He's so skinny!

02:37.232 --> 02:39.566
Sit down before you fall down,
you must be hungry.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.067
Noodie! Noodie!

02:41.220 --> 02:44.054
There you are.
Bring some lasagna for this boy.

02:44.147 --> 02:45.813
Wow, o-okay.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.315
But I am here to work.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.501
Would you listen to him, Momma?

02:49.728 --> 02:52.487
This good boy wants to work
right away.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.581
-(sobs quietly)
-Momma, what is it?

02:54.733 --> 02:55.749
Momma.

02:55.901 --> 02:58.084
He's like the child
we could never have.

02:58.179 --> 02:59.403
Oh, I'm so sorry.

02:59.421 --> 03:01.405
My ovaries are like
old dried grapes.

03:01.498 --> 03:04.090
No, Momma! I love your ovaries.

03:04.243 --> 03:06.000
Oh, this old flatterer.

03:06.020 --> 03:08.187
Noodie!
Where's the garlic bread?

03:08.414 --> 03:10.522
Momma! He only has one arm.

03:10.749 --> 03:11.932
Sorry, Noodie.
Next time,

03:12.084 --> 03:13.250
you tuck it
under the arm, okay?

03:13.268 --> 03:15.268
Hi, Mr. Noodie. I'm Ham.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.421
So, Ham, tell me about yourself.

03:17.439 --> 03:18.772
Well, I love your restaurant,

03:18.924 --> 03:20.090
and I want to learn
the business

03:20.108 --> 03:21.425
because I bake cakes.

03:21.443 --> 03:23.760
(laughs) A baker.

03:23.853 --> 03:24.945
Did you hear that, Momma?

03:25.097 --> 03:26.354
All the other boys
are out there

03:26.373 --> 03:27.948
riding motorcycles
and chewing gum

03:28.100 --> 03:30.617
and this boy's at home
baking beautiful cakes.

03:30.769 --> 03:33.119
Your dessert cart was
one of my first inspirations.

03:33.214 --> 03:35.789
Well, if things go well
this week... you never know.

03:35.883 --> 03:38.775
Maybe one of your desserts will
end up on the dessert cart.

03:38.868 --> 03:42.036
-What? No way.
-Ah, it'll be so nice

03:42.056 --> 03:43.463
to have an extra hand
for the week.

03:43.615 --> 03:45.707
You know, Noodie certainly
wouldn't mind an extra hand.

03:45.801 --> 03:46.816
(laughs)

03:46.818 --> 03:48.393
He's belly laughing,
look at him.

03:49.805 --> 03:51.455
Gill? What are you doing here?

03:51.548 --> 03:53.790
This is my assignment
for Careers class.

03:53.809 --> 03:55.642
I overheard you say,
"I'm putting the newspaper

03:55.794 --> 03:56.977
as my first choice."

03:57.129 --> 03:57.978
And now here we are.

03:58.130 --> 03:59.404
Welcome to the<i> Lone Moose Wind.</i>

03:59.556 --> 04:01.481
As our junior
Career Week employees,

04:01.633 --> 04:02.724
you'll be doing
the most important jobs

04:02.743 --> 04:03.800
in the journalism industry--

04:03.819 --> 04:05.244
making copies, filing

04:05.395 --> 04:08.305
and bringing me exactly three
Red Vines every day at 4:15.

04:08.398 --> 04:10.657
-And seven more Red Vines
at 4:30.
-JUDY: Excuse me?

04:10.751 --> 04:12.734
Um, will there be an opportunity
to write a story?

04:12.753 --> 04:14.753
I'm very interested
in getting my first byline.

04:14.904 --> 04:17.314
What if I brought you
a really juicy scoop?

04:17.332 --> 04:18.740
Sure. Write your juicy scoop

04:18.759 --> 04:20.500
on a Post-It
and put it under my Red Vines.

04:20.594 --> 04:23.336
Less talky, more coffee.
Go refill the pot, kid.

04:23.489 --> 04:24.912
Do you mind tackling
the coffee, Gill?

04:24.932 --> 04:26.431
I'm going to look for my scoop.

04:26.583 --> 04:27.340
I love you, Judy!

04:27.493 --> 04:29.009
Er, I mean, I'd love to, Judy.

04:29.161 --> 04:30.018
Thanks, Gill!

04:31.254 --> 04:32.512
You must be Bethany.

04:32.664 --> 04:34.998
It's not the name
I would have chosen for myself,

04:35.091 --> 04:36.516
but I was a baby at the time.

04:36.668 --> 04:37.776
Completely powerless.

04:37.927 --> 04:39.761
You probably won't
be needing that sword.

04:39.855 --> 04:41.004
We fish with nets.

04:41.023 --> 04:42.447
It's not for fish.
It's for pirates.

04:42.599 --> 04:45.266
You know, Bluebeards,
Blackbeards, scalawags--

04:45.360 --> 04:47.861
some of 'em are ghosts
rattling around in chains.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.955
May I ask why there's no cannon
on this boat?

04:50.182 --> 04:52.516
I've been begging you
to get a cannon for years.

04:52.534 --> 04:54.534
When the ghost pirates try
to board the ship

04:54.628 --> 04:57.020
and there's no large ordnance
to shoot them with,

04:57.113 --> 04:58.038
don't blame us.

04:58.190 --> 04:59.781
Yeah, Dad. Don't blame us.

04:59.875 --> 05:01.466
All right, well, let's set sail.

05:01.618 --> 05:03.710
Aw, if he stares
at that girl any harder,

05:03.862 --> 05:05.470
his eyes are going
to literally turn into hearts.

05:05.622 --> 05:08.122
Oh, man,
then he'll have three hearts,

05:08.216 --> 05:09.866
no eyes, and a huge crush.

05:09.885 --> 05:12.218
Classic pre-teen combo.

05:12.371 --> 05:14.146
<i> JUDY:</i>
<i> How would you two feel about</i>

05:14.297 --> 05:16.982
renewing your vows on horseback?

05:17.133 --> 05:18.966
It would be a shoo-in
for the paper's wedding page.

05:19.061 --> 05:21.135
Horses?
Mm-mm, that's a no for me.

05:21.229 --> 05:23.488
Anyone who considers
an unwashed carrot a "treat"

05:23.681 --> 05:24.823
is just off.

05:25.050 --> 05:27.217
Also, one bit my armpit
at the county fair.

05:27.235 --> 05:29.477
Judy, I'm gonna have
to defer to Honeybee here.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.237
If you bite my wife,
you're out of my life.

05:31.332 --> 05:32.906
Ham, how was your first day?

05:33.058 --> 05:35.559
I basically just shadowed
Poppa and Momma and Noodie,

05:35.652 --> 05:37.410
but tomorrow night
I get to be out on the floor,

05:37.563 --> 05:39.338
bussing tables
and living the dream!

05:39.489 --> 05:41.081
When you work there,
do they tell you

05:41.175 --> 05:42.507
who's inside Noodie the Noodle?

05:42.734 --> 05:44.734
No, it had the costume on
the entire time I was there.

05:44.828 --> 05:46.011
It even drove away in it,

05:46.162 --> 05:48.180
its one tiny linguini arm
gripping the wheel.

05:50.092 --> 05:51.666
Scoop alert! Scoop alert!

05:51.685 --> 05:53.501
"Scoop alert"?
That's not something we say.

05:53.520 --> 05:56.462
Sorry. My dog, Bubble,
found three lynx kittens

05:56.615 --> 05:58.023
and she's raising them
as her own.

05:58.174 --> 05:59.191
Unlikely animal friends?

05:59.342 --> 06:00.842
Our readers love those.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.677
All right, write it up and
you've got yourself a byline.

06:02.696 --> 06:03.920
Gill? (sighs)

06:04.013 --> 06:05.179
Bye-bye byline.

06:41.643 --> 06:42.792
give it a quick rinse,

06:42.886 --> 06:44.051
and then you put it
in the walk-in

You got it?

06:45.147 --> 06:47.197
I... got it!

06:53.080 --> 06:54.988
-All done!
-Ham,

06:55.082 --> 06:56.748
I meant all the pasta.

06:56.900 --> 06:59.233
The... stuff in the bus tubs?

06:59.327 --> 07:01.828
-Yep.
-But that pasta's dirty.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.329
Well, only till
we clean it, Ham.

07:03.482 --> 07:05.740
At the end of the day, I don't
throw myself in the trash.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.835
I take a shower and
Poppa's good as new! Right?

07:08.987 --> 07:09.836
I guess...

07:09.930 --> 07:11.263
And make sure you get all of it.

07:11.414 --> 07:13.515
We don't throw any of it away.

07:16.662 --> 07:18.186
Holy ravioli.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.758
See anything strange
on the water lately, Dad?

07:23.777 --> 07:24.943
Dead bodies? Mermaids?

07:25.094 --> 07:26.611
Swimmers you can tell
are peeing in the water?

07:26.763 --> 07:28.004
No, but I saw a desk chair

07:28.097 --> 07:29.597
floating in the open ocean once.

07:29.691 --> 07:31.116
That was a real thought-starter.

07:31.267 --> 07:32.451
Gotta tell Bethany.

07:32.602 --> 07:34.360
Probably thrown there
by an office pirate.

07:34.513 --> 07:37.104
Dad, do you... enjoy working?

07:37.124 --> 07:38.364
Mostly, yes.

07:38.517 --> 07:39.791
I can't control the weather,
or the fish,

07:39.943 --> 07:42.443
but overall, work gives me
a feeling of contentment.

07:42.537 --> 07:43.945
Why do you ask, Ham?

07:43.964 --> 07:45.964
Was working at a real restaurant
harder than you expected?

07:46.191 --> 07:48.875
There are definitely
a few things I'd do differently.

07:49.027 --> 07:50.969
Well, perhaps you should
say something, Ham.

07:51.196 --> 07:53.472
A good boss
always listens to suggestions.

07:53.699 --> 07:56.475
Like when Judy suggested
that we warn each other

07:56.702 --> 07:58.535
when we poop
in the tiny boat bathroom.

07:58.553 --> 08:00.553
That 15-minute
cooling-off period

08:00.706 --> 08:02.129
really raised morale.

08:02.224 --> 08:05.542
Bethany, I'm gonna show you
how to sweep water off the deck.

08:05.560 --> 08:07.969
Oh, no, thanks. Moon is going
to walk me through

08:08.063 --> 08:11.214
calling "Mayday" on the radio
in case of pirates.

08:11.233 --> 08:12.657
Well, actually, Moon will be...

08:12.809 --> 08:14.993
Dad. Can Honeybee and I talk
to you in the wheelhouse?

08:15.144 --> 08:17.070
What's up, guys? Are you upset?

08:17.222 --> 08:18.663
We can't all sweep the deck.

08:18.815 --> 08:19.981
Uh, no, we wanted to alert you

08:20.000 --> 08:22.501
to a certain situation
that's happening.

08:22.652 --> 08:24.336
With Moon...?

08:24.487 --> 08:25.670
And Bethany...?

08:25.897 --> 08:27.247
Oh, no, does Moon want
to sweep the deck also?

08:27.341 --> 08:29.232
No one wants
to sweep the deck, Beef.

08:29.251 --> 08:31.417
Moon has a crush on Bethany.

08:31.512 --> 08:33.737
Oh. Oh...

08:33.830 --> 08:36.181
Moon, I need someone
to show Bethany

08:36.332 --> 08:37.741
how to call "Mayday"
on the radio

08:37.759 --> 08:39.592
in case of... pirates.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.745
Now we're talkin'.

08:41.763 --> 08:44.005
Um, excuse me? Poppa?

08:44.099 --> 08:46.507
Ah, what can I do for you,
my young Ham?

08:46.527 --> 08:49.769
I, uh... I just wanted to ask
you about the pasta rinsing.

08:49.921 --> 08:51.345
It just seems like, maybe,

08:51.365 --> 08:52.864
we could just
make new pasta every day?

08:53.091 --> 08:55.925
Ham. Have you been talking to
people about rinsing the pasta?

08:56.019 --> 08:57.427
No, just you, Poppa.

08:57.520 --> 08:59.445
Good. You were right
to bring it to me.

08:59.598 --> 09:02.432
Ham, when you run a restaurant,
you need a lot of food,

09:02.450 --> 09:04.434
and that costs a lot of money.

09:04.527 --> 09:06.861
Momma and I,
we're not rich, you know?

09:06.955 --> 09:09.272
We operate on
a very thin margin,

09:09.291 --> 09:12.867
and we like to keep our prices
low for hardworking families.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.869
Everyone in Lone Moose
is like our babies

09:14.963 --> 09:17.280
and we want them
to be fat and happy.

09:17.299 --> 09:19.282
Why do you want
the babies to be sad, Ham?

09:19.375 --> 09:20.800
Why do you hate babies?

09:20.894 --> 09:22.619
Sorry, sorr-- I don't.

09:22.637 --> 09:23.970
You worry too much, Ham.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.398
Now let's give everyone
a good dinner tonight, huh?

09:27.383 --> 09:28.215
Ow!

09:28.235 --> 09:31.027
Oh. (laughs) Hey, Noodie.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.648
C-Can I go by?

09:35.801 --> 09:36.724
Okay.

09:36.743 --> 09:39.411
You're not mov--
I'll just-- Yep.

09:42.157 --> 09:45.232
So, Crispin, have you
witnessed any mall crimes

09:45.252 --> 09:46.476
that I can write up
for the paper?

09:46.536 --> 09:47.902
Gloria! No.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.996
They've got this place
locked down pretty tight, Judy.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.405
Thank you.

09:51.499 --> 09:53.741
Wait. Didn't that cup
say "Gloria?"

09:53.760 --> 09:56.836
Excuse me! That smoothie is
supposed to be for a "Gloria."

09:56.930 --> 09:59.172
(gasps)
Smoothie snatching, Santiago?

09:59.266 --> 10:02.175
Well, sometimes I just like
to give a woman's name

10:02.327 --> 10:03.993
and pretend
I'm picking up a smoothie

10:04.012 --> 10:05.511
for my imaginary wife.

10:05.664 --> 10:07.421
Oh. Santiago...

10:07.515 --> 10:08.998
I know, I know.

10:09.017 --> 10:11.684
Will someone in this mall
please shoplift?!

10:11.837 --> 10:13.002
Ma'am, I'm looking at you.

10:13.096 --> 10:14.613
-WOMAN: No!
-Fine.

Hello, son. I left you
some spaghetti in the fridge.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.689
What? Why would you do that?

10:32.707 --> 10:34.115
Ah! What was I thinking?

10:34.209 --> 10:37.043
You're probably full of
delicious Poppa's pasta, huh?

10:37.137 --> 10:40.004
Uh-huh. I'm gonna go take a
shower even though I'm not sure

10:40.231 --> 10:41.122
I can ever get clean.

10:41.216 --> 10:42.866
Well, I recommend using soap.

10:42.884 --> 10:44.517
It's worked for me
all these years.

10:47.630 --> 10:51.298
Oh, no. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no...

10:51.393 --> 10:53.610
There's something's
going on with the shower.

10:57.732 --> 10:58.823
(screams)

10:59.050 --> 11:01.493
(screaming)

11:02.721 --> 11:04.070
(gasps, yells)

11:04.164 --> 11:08.241
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...

11:08.335 --> 11:09.726
-No!
-(knocking loudly)

11:09.819 --> 11:11.895
JUDY: Ham? Are you having
a difficult bowel movement?

11:11.913 --> 11:13.913
-Do you want a glass of water?
-No.

11:14.065 --> 11:15.899
(laughs weakly)
I just saw a spider.

11:15.917 --> 11:17.901
JUDY:
Okay. Don't get bitten by it.

11:17.994 --> 11:20.178
If it's radioactive,
it's a whole thing.

11:22.349 --> 11:25.241
(high-pitched voice):
Excuse me, young man,
I ordered the farts.

11:25.334 --> 11:27.001
-(laughter)
-Oh, hi.

11:27.095 --> 11:28.244
What are you all doing here?

11:28.263 --> 11:29.670
We thought
we'd surprise you, son.

11:29.764 --> 11:31.356
It was my idea to come
without telling you.

11:31.583 --> 11:34.341
Sorry. I've been a total
prank-aholic lately.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.528
Yesterday he told me
I had something on my face,

11:36.755 --> 11:38.179
and when I said, "What?"

11:38.198 --> 11:40.031
he said, "A beautiful smile."
And you know?

11:40.183 --> 11:41.925
It made me feel beautiful.

11:42.018 --> 11:43.368
I call 'em "Positive Pranks."

11:43.519 --> 11:44.685
Oh! Ham!

11:44.705 --> 11:46.187
This must be your family.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.764
I see the resemblance.

11:47.857 --> 11:50.191
The Tobins are here!
Momma! Noodie!

11:50.210 --> 11:51.951
We have special guests tonight.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.044
(giggles)

11:53.196 --> 11:55.121
Poppa Paul knows
who we are, guys.

11:55.215 --> 11:58.365
Now, who's ready for a little
bit of Poppa on their plate?

11:58.460 --> 11:59.366
Uh... all of us?

11:59.386 --> 12:01.444
Perfect. Pasta for everyone!

12:01.463 --> 12:04.097
Ham, your family's hungry.
Go get-y the spaghetti.

12:07.285 --> 12:10.453
No, no, no. I can't
feed my family dirty noodles.

12:10.546 --> 12:13.565
I know.
I'll make them fresh pasta.

12:14.459 --> 12:15.716
Ah!

12:15.810 --> 12:17.643
-Noodie, what are you doing?
-(yelps)

12:17.796 --> 12:19.553
Maybe a better question
is what are you doing, Ham?

12:19.647 --> 12:21.889
-I...
-You don't have
to make the pasta.

12:21.983 --> 12:23.299
It's already made.

12:23.318 --> 12:25.910
Ham, always working so hard.

12:26.137 --> 12:27.987
I've got the bowls
all ready for you.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.138
Go on, Ham.

12:29.232 --> 12:32.066
Just, uh, gonna go tell 'em.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.159
It's the right thing to do.

12:33.311 --> 12:35.503
Ham. Come with me.

12:37.148 --> 12:38.089
Take a seat.

12:38.241 --> 12:39.907
Sit on any papers you'd like.

12:40.001 --> 12:42.594
Wow, it really smells
like fish in here.

12:42.745 --> 12:45.412
Ah, yeah. Well, the fish hate
when you clean the tanks,

12:45.432 --> 12:47.006
so, eh, what are--
what are you gonna do?

12:47.100 --> 12:48.508
Ham, Momma and I were chatting

12:48.660 --> 12:50.660
and we thought since
your family is here tonight,

12:50.753 --> 12:53.329
you can make them
a special dessert and...

12:53.422 --> 12:54.847
we'll put it
on the dessert cart.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.015
Are you serious?

12:56.167 --> 12:57.424
Yes, I'm serious!

12:57.519 --> 13:00.594
Remember, we told you,
we're a team, a family.

13:00.688 --> 13:02.614
You do for us, we do for you.

13:02.841 --> 13:04.173
You understand what I'm saying?

13:04.192 --> 13:05.283
I think so...

13:05.434 --> 13:07.510
And who knows?
If tonight goes well,

13:07.562 --> 13:08.769
maybe there'll be
a little plastic version

13:08.863 --> 13:11.848
of your dessert that'll be
on our cart permanently.

13:11.866 --> 13:13.366
Permanently? Wow.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.535
To think of
someone finding my dessert

13:15.687 --> 13:17.444
after the apocalypse,
in the rubble.

13:17.464 --> 13:18.871
What a dream.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.507
So we have a deal?

13:22.193 --> 13:23.968
Mm-mm-mm-mm.

13:24.195 --> 13:26.137
(all making sounds of enjoyment)

13:27.808 --> 13:29.808
I don't know what you do
to make it taste so good, Poppa,

13:29.993 --> 13:32.201
but whatever it is,
keep doing it.

13:32.295 --> 13:33.886
(laughing):
Oh, we will.

13:34.039 --> 13:35.330
We will.

13:35.332 --> 13:37.707
Off to look for scoops again!

13:37.725 --> 13:38.875
If I don't find a story soon,

13:38.968 --> 13:40.543
my journalism career
could stall

13:40.562 --> 13:42.153
before I ever get to be
a burnt-out reporter.

13:42.305 --> 13:45.472
You don't know of anything weird
going on around town, do ya?

13:45.567 --> 13:47.450
Um, actually...

13:48.477 --> 13:49.977
Ah!

13:50.071 --> 13:52.738
-Ham, you okay?
-Uh, yup.

13:52.891 --> 13:54.999
Everything's fine.
I should probably get to work

13:55.151 --> 13:58.077
because I love it
and everything's normal there.

13:58.229 --> 14:00.088
Normal, normal, normal.

14:01.490 --> 14:02.231
There you are!

14:02.250 --> 14:03.657
Your dessert was so good.

14:03.751 --> 14:05.659
Everyone's asking for Ham's
Chocolate-Cherry Pizza Cake.

14:05.753 --> 14:08.012
"Looks like a pizza,
tastes like a sweets-uh!"

14:08.239 --> 14:09.180
(laughs weakly)

14:09.332 --> 14:11.349
Um, Momma, can I talk to you?

14:11.500 --> 14:13.409
What's wrong, my beautiful boy?

14:13.428 --> 14:16.746
(sighs) I love being
part of the MommaPoppa family,

14:16.764 --> 14:18.598
but I'm having trouble
with the, uh...

14:18.692 --> 14:19.749
the pasta rinsing.

14:19.767 --> 14:21.267
I told Poppa
I'd keep it a secret,

14:21.361 --> 14:23.436
but it feels kind of... wrong.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.104
To me. And disgusting.

14:25.256 --> 14:26.698
-To me. Sorry.
-Oh, Ham, I know.

14:26.849 --> 14:28.849
It's something Poppa started
back at the beginning

14:28.869 --> 14:31.018
when we didn't have
two meatballs to rub together.

14:31.112 --> 14:32.203
Maybe it's time for a change.

14:32.355 --> 14:33.946
You know what?
I'll talk to Poppa.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.264
-You will?
-Of course!

14:35.283 --> 14:37.041
-You worry too much.
-(sighs)

14:37.268 --> 14:39.043
Thank you for talking
to Poppa for me, Momma.

14:39.195 --> 14:40.378
Talking to me about what?

14:40.529 --> 14:43.047
Ham, I left my salad starter
out in the car.

14:43.274 --> 14:45.199
It's a green bag in the back.

14:45.293 --> 14:46.275
Would you go grab it for me

14:46.369 --> 14:48.177
-while I talk to Poppa?
-Mm-hmm.

14:50.281 --> 14:53.725
Oh, God, that smell!

14:53.876 --> 14:56.210
Green bag. Where is it?
Where is it? This can't be it.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.396
It says "Mice For Snakes"?

14:58.623 --> 14:59.805
Yep, it's it.

14:59.958 --> 15:01.641
-(flies buzzing)
-Momma, no!

15:01.735 --> 15:03.234
Ugh, you're bad too?

15:03.461 --> 15:05.978
Ham Tobin, what have you
gotten yourself into?

15:06.072 --> 15:08.389
Momma and Poppa are filthy?

15:08.483 --> 15:11.300
Ham Tobin, what have you gotten
yourself into? (squawks)

15:11.319 --> 15:12.635
(whispering):
Stop. Stop.

15:12.728 --> 15:13.912
Momma and Poppa are filthy.

15:14.139 --> 15:15.788
(Ham groans)

15:16.899 --> 15:19.659
(sighs)
Another day without pirates.

15:20.478 --> 15:22.420
Dad? What do you think
the chances are

15:22.571 --> 15:23.996
that we're gonna
encounter pirates

15:24.090 --> 15:25.331
in the next couple of days,

15:25.483 --> 15:27.074
specifically right after school?

15:27.093 --> 15:29.318
May I look into that
and get back to you, son?

15:29.412 --> 15:33.598
Sure, Dad. Thank you for your
consideration in this matter.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.417
Hey, Ham-a-lama-ding-dong.
What's up?

15:36.511 --> 15:38.511
You know how
you were asking me earlier

15:38.663 --> 15:41.847
-if anything weird
was going on in town?
-Mm-hmm.

15:41.942 --> 15:45.168
Welp, I got a scoop
I gotta let loose.

15:45.261 --> 15:47.761
Holy cow. This is big.

15:47.855 --> 15:48.780
This is very big.

15:49.007 --> 15:50.506
And gross. Very gross.

15:50.599 --> 15:52.191
I'm so sorry
I let you eat garbage.

15:52.343 --> 15:53.767
There was just
a lot of pressure

15:53.787 --> 15:56.028
and I was blinded by the glory
of the dessert cart.

15:56.181 --> 15:57.513
It's completely understandable.

15:57.532 --> 16:00.107
(shudders) Who knows how old
some of those noodles are

16:00.201 --> 16:01.275
if they never throw them out.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.368
In and out of dozens of mouths,

16:02.520 --> 16:04.187
resting on hundreds of chins.

16:04.280 --> 16:05.964
You know the sign for infinity?

16:06.191 --> 16:07.707
Think about that as a noodle.

16:07.801 --> 16:10.117
An infinite loop
of pasta washing.

16:10.136 --> 16:11.970
We need proof. (gasps) I know.

16:12.197 --> 16:13.212
I'll come in disguise.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.031
(British accent):
I'm a storied princess

16:15.049 --> 16:16.382
from a faraway monarchy

16:16.476 --> 16:18.884
whose father has sent her
to find the perfect restaurant

16:18.979 --> 16:20.553
to hold the coronation
of his heir!

16:20.705 --> 16:23.130
Or I could take some pictures
with my phone?

16:23.149 --> 16:24.390
Mm, yeah, that could work.

16:24.542 --> 16:27.026
♪ ♪

16:35.236 --> 16:36.235
Hey!

16:36.329 --> 16:38.479
Noodie, give me
back my ph... Oh.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.124
Well, well,
what do we have here?

16:44.170 --> 16:46.504
Ham. What are you trying
to do, huh?

16:46.655 --> 16:47.505
Uh... I was just...

16:47.656 --> 16:48.673
taking some pictures.

16:48.900 --> 16:50.233
So I could remember
my time here.

16:50.251 --> 16:51.342
Don't lie to Poppa.

16:51.494 --> 16:53.011
You don't like it, the rinsing.

16:53.162 --> 16:56.088
Look, Ham, I didn't want
to have to tell you this,

16:56.241 --> 16:58.182
but we have to wash the pasta.

16:58.409 --> 17:00.576
We can't afford new pasta,

17:00.595 --> 17:02.836
because... Momma...

17:02.930 --> 17:04.505
she's... sick.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.932
-I don't believe you.
-Then Noodie's sick.

17:07.027 --> 17:09.418
No, Poppa, you can't
just switch who's sick.

17:09.437 --> 17:12.104
Ham, you were gonna use
these pictures to ruin us.

17:12.257 --> 17:13.680
I said I would talk to Poppa.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.349
Why are you so impatient?

17:15.443 --> 17:16.850
You don't trust your Momma?

17:16.944 --> 17:18.444
I saw your car, Momma.

17:18.596 --> 17:19.520
You're part of this.

17:19.614 --> 17:20.946
You were keeping salad in a bag

17:21.099 --> 17:23.065
that's specifically
meant for mice.

17:23.067 --> 17:24.208
It's so gross!

17:24.435 --> 17:27.286
Aw, Ham, Ham, Ham, Ham, Ham.

17:27.438 --> 17:28.621
Poppa, I know what
this is about.

17:28.773 --> 17:31.240
We were gonna wait for
your last night, but here.

17:31.242 --> 17:33.367
It's your dessert, Ham.
For the cart.

17:33.461 --> 17:35.444
It just came back
from the molder.

17:35.463 --> 17:36.962
They said it was
the most beautiful

17:37.057 --> 17:38.281
fake dessert they ever made.

17:38.299 --> 17:39.615
Everyone was crying.

17:39.708 --> 17:42.060
Everyone was crying
and now I'm crying.

17:42.287 --> 17:44.470
(crying):
I'm so proud of my son.

17:44.564 --> 17:45.730
I'm not your son.

17:45.899 --> 17:48.549
And I'm not keeping
your weird secrets anymore!

17:48.568 --> 17:50.234
Yes, you are, Ham.

17:51.296 --> 17:53.387
-You broke my heart, Ham.
-Get out of here.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.722
And take your
Cherry-Chocolate Pizza with you.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.075
Noodie, give him the boot-y.

17:57.226 --> 17:58.743
It's fine, I can wal...

17:58.894 --> 17:59.911
Ah! Ah, ah!

18:00.062 --> 18:00.912
Whoa...

18:01.063 --> 18:02.246
(grunts)

18:03.308 --> 18:06.400
Ah, man. I forgot to ask them
to sign my class credit slip.

18:06.419 --> 18:09.145
Oh, hey, there's Noodie.
Maybe he'll sign it.

18:09.163 --> 18:11.238
Oh, hey, Noodie. Ah! Ah! Ah!

18:11.332 --> 18:13.240
JUDY:
It's all right here,

18:13.334 --> 18:15.075
-including photos.
-They sauced my phone,

18:15.095 --> 18:17.244
but I had already
uploaded them to the cloud.

18:17.338 --> 18:19.597
Cloudy with a chance of justice.

18:19.748 --> 18:22.007
Write it up and you've got
yourself a byline, Judy.

18:22.102 --> 18:24.060
Congratulations.

18:25.163 --> 18:26.345
What are you waiting for?

18:26.439 --> 18:27.438
Balloons aren't gonna
drop from the ceiling.

18:27.665 --> 18:29.165
Congrats, Judy.

18:29.183 --> 18:30.108
I'm glad you got your story.

18:30.335 --> 18:31.943
Thanks, Ham.
I'm gonna get my byline,

18:32.170 --> 18:33.336
and you're gonna be a hero.

18:33.429 --> 18:34.595
You're like Erin Brockovich,

18:34.614 --> 18:36.263
but with pasta instead of
contaminated water.

18:36.282 --> 18:38.007
More like Erin Pasta-vich.

18:38.100 --> 18:40.509
Oh, that's good. I'm gonna put
that in my article.

18:40.528 --> 18:42.695
Kids, I think
I may have spotted

18:42.789 --> 18:44.122
pirates off the starboard side.

18:44.273 --> 18:45.456
Now, come on, you two,

18:45.608 --> 18:47.107
we can't let them
overtake the boat.

18:47.201 --> 18:48.684
Ahoy there, ship... guys!

18:48.703 --> 18:50.186
Mind if we come aboard?

18:50.279 --> 18:52.130
Babe, we're pirates.
You gotta be more intense.

18:52.281 --> 18:53.965
We're gonna cut you
from mouth to anus

18:54.116 --> 18:55.541
and then stuff
yer insides with gold!

18:55.693 --> 18:56.692
Geez, Honeybee.

18:56.711 --> 18:58.194
See? This is where the cannon

18:58.287 --> 18:59.637
would come in handy, Mr. Tobin.

18:59.864 --> 19:02.047
(grunting)

19:02.200 --> 19:03.382
Is that all you got?

19:03.534 --> 19:05.143
You know what?
Don't be mad, Moon,

19:05.294 --> 19:07.311
but I've decided
to switch sides.

19:07.463 --> 19:09.738
I just like their whole vibe
or whatever.

19:09.798 --> 19:11.298
Sorry, Dad. I'm with Bethany.

19:11.392 --> 19:13.225
Argh! Let's filet some Beef!

19:13.378 --> 19:15.469
Uh-oh, Dad!
Cover your anus!

19:15.563 --> 19:17.046
MOON:
So, Bethany,

19:17.139 --> 19:19.323
just because the Careers class
assignment is over

19:19.475 --> 19:21.159
doesn't mean
the good times have to end.

19:21.310 --> 19:23.310
Moon, I really loved
my time here,

19:23.329 --> 19:24.737
but Career Week is over,

19:24.831 --> 19:27.999
and I have to get back to
what I usually do after school,

19:28.150 --> 19:29.816
which is absolutely nothing.

19:29.911 --> 19:31.076
Understood.

19:31.171 --> 19:32.986
Goodbye, Mr. Tobin.
Goodbye, Moon.

19:33.080 --> 19:35.006
I'll never forget you.

19:35.233 --> 19:37.733
Thanks for doing
the pirate adventure, Dad.

19:37.752 --> 19:39.568
I know Bethany's too old for me,

19:39.662 --> 19:42.663
but I might ask her out
when I'm ready to start dating

19:42.682 --> 19:44.407
in 20 to 34 years.

19:44.425 --> 19:45.574
You're welcome, son.

19:45.593 --> 19:47.351
I have some great
first date suggestions.

19:47.503 --> 19:50.021
For instance, I know a wonderful
fallen log off Highway 49.

19:50.172 --> 19:53.507
It's often very dry.
It makes for a delightful sit.

19:53.526 --> 19:56.527
Sorry I blew the whistle on
your favorite restaurant, Dad.

19:56.679 --> 19:57.920
That's okay, son.

19:58.013 --> 19:59.588
There's plenty of
restaurant fish in the sea.

19:59.682 --> 20:01.515
It's just a bummer.
Working at the restaurant

20:01.534 --> 20:03.759
was my dream and it turned out
to be a nightmare.

20:03.778 --> 20:05.852
Sometimes that's
what working a job is:

20:05.947 --> 20:08.280
finding out that
that job isn't for you.

20:08.433 --> 20:11.692
Hey, but maybe you'll open
your own bakery someday.

20:11.711 --> 20:14.270
Yeah, and you can rinse off the
cakes at the end of the night.

20:14.288 --> 20:16.530
You know what? I didn't eat
a bite at that restaurant.

20:16.624 --> 20:19.124
I knew something was off when
I saw that creepy noodle guy.

20:19.219 --> 20:22.369
I have good people sense, and
also good noodle-people sense.

20:22.388 --> 20:23.963
The important thing is that

20:24.115 --> 20:25.281
Momma and Poppa learned
their lesson.

20:25.374 --> 20:29.268
That place is gonna be shut down
for a long time.

20:30.137 --> 20:31.804
Are they open again already?!

20:31.898 --> 20:33.380
WOLF:
Minestrone pony! They are!

20:33.399 --> 20:36.216
So, nothing I did
meant anything?

20:36.236 --> 20:37.977
Nobody cared about my story?

20:38.129 --> 20:39.295
You both did the right thing.

20:39.388 --> 20:40.721
A sad but true fact of life is

20:40.815 --> 20:42.965
sometimes you do the right thing
and no one cares.

20:42.984 --> 20:44.575
But I am definitely
proud of you guys.

20:44.727 --> 20:46.652
Thanks, Dad.
I'm proud of me, too.

20:46.746 --> 20:50.306
So, are we thinking we're eating
at MommaPoppa's tonight, or...

20:50.399 --> 20:52.733
-Wolf, no!
