Previously on Between...

00:02.866 --> 00:06.002
[soldier] Congratulations, you're an
official citizen of the quarantine zone.

00:06.070 --> 00:11.074
[Miller] We have confirmed reports
that no one over 22 is left alive.

00:11.141 --> 00:12.641
Mom!

00:12.709 --> 00:14.010
[Miller] In the meantime,
the most important thing

00:14.078 --> 00:15.711
is to gather all of the bodies

00:15.779 --> 00:16.879
and burn them.

00:16.947 --> 00:18.380
I like it when you're in charge.

00:18.448 --> 00:20.148
[Miller] Once the
bodies have been burned,

00:20.216 --> 00:23.919
we hope that we will be
able to lift the quarantine.

00:24.220 --> 00:25.220
You could at least
name your son.

00:25.288 --> 00:26.789
[Wiley] I don't care!

00:26.857 --> 00:28.757
[lawyer] My client will
make the final payment

00:28.825 --> 00:30.893
after the family receives
possession of the baby.

00:31.394 --> 00:32.827
[Chuck] Are you sure
you didn't see anything?

00:33.662 --> 00:35.364
It was an old truck.

00:35.931 --> 00:36.798
[Felix] Ronnie
and Pat's pick-up.

00:38.401 --> 00:39.501
[Adam] Chuck's
sister was murdered.

00:40.269 --> 00:42.770
So who's "Art Carey"?

00:42.838 --> 00:44.406
[Adam] He's got a Level
5 government clearance.

00:45.174 --> 00:46.541
[Wiley] There's an envelope
with my name on it in the safe.

00:46.609 --> 00:47.575
That's all I want.

00:48.243 --> 00:49.611
You were right. There...

00:51.213 --> 00:51.980
Maybe you're not so bad.

00:56.151 --> 00:56.951
[Adam] Come on, Art Carey.

01:00.441 --> 01:01.525
Wiley?

02:28.460 --> 02:33.255
Citizens of Pretty Lake,
recent air quality test results

02:33.340 --> 02:39.136
have confirmed the presence of
an unknown substance in elevated levels.

02:39.220 --> 02:42.849
This substance, we believe,
caused the deaths.

02:42.932 --> 02:48.313
Until those levels decrease, we have
no choice but to continue the quarantine.

02:53.234 --> 02:54.361
Hey.

02:56.321 --> 02:59.198
Hey. How you feeling?

03:02.201 --> 03:03.620
You saved my life.

03:05.663 --> 03:07.289
Who would've guessed?

03:07.374 --> 03:10.460
The school nerd is a superhero.

03:11.919 --> 03:15.131
I think the term "geek"
is more politically correct.

03:17.759 --> 03:18.843
What happened?

03:20.345 --> 03:24.641
My best diagnosis,
thanks to hashtag Dr. Google,

03:24.724 --> 03:26.768
is that you were severely dehydrated.

03:28.561 --> 03:31.022
That, combined with
the bleeding and exhaustion,

03:31.105 --> 03:32.774
caused you to pass out.

03:34.066 --> 03:36.318
What's my long-term prognosis?

03:36.403 --> 03:38.905
Death, for sure.

03:38.988 --> 03:41.366
But hopefully not for decades.

03:41.449 --> 03:43.535
However, as we've recently seen
in Pretty Lake,

03:43.618 --> 03:45.327
nothing is guaranteed.

03:49.165 --> 03:50.458
Come here.

04:00.092 --> 04:01.218
Closer.

04:24.909 --> 04:26.911
I've been waiting two years for that.

04:28.955 --> 04:30.582
Yeah, I know.

04:35.336 --> 04:37.547
Seriously, am I gonna be okay?

04:39.090 --> 04:40.592
Yeah.

04:41.551 --> 04:42.885
For sure.

04:44.011 --> 04:45.137
[sighs]

04:45.930 --> 04:48.475
[reporter] This is exclusive footage
obtained from those

04:48.558 --> 04:51.436
still left inside
the quarantine area last night,

04:51.519 --> 04:55.147
just before the government announced
Pretty Lake a no-fly zone.

04:55.231 --> 04:56.858
Since the news broke of the quarantine,

04:56.941 --> 05:01.278
extensive protests have erupted
outside the area and in nearby towns,

05:01.362 --> 05:04.532
where people anxiously await
a release of all the children.

05:04.616 --> 05:06.909
Minister Miller has stated, and I quote,

05:06.993 --> 05:10.079
that, "Until we know the nature
of this outbreak, how it transmits,

05:10.162 --> 05:15.417
any intervention in Pretty Lake
poses a threat to national security."

05:23.342 --> 05:24.886
Where did you find that?

05:24.969 --> 05:29.056
I found it in Lana's bedroom,
underneath her bed.

05:29.140 --> 05:31.267
Let me see that, please. Here.

05:40.485 --> 05:41.819
[sighs]

05:44.989 --> 05:48.117
Look, Gord, I'm really not in the mood.
We are heading out there tonight.

05:48.200 --> 05:50.244
So I heard.
But think it through.

05:51.453 --> 05:54.624
You can't just go out to the Creekers
and start busting skulls.

05:54.707 --> 05:58.210
I was supposed to go there
last night after the fire.

05:58.294 --> 06:01.130
Okay, but you said that the authorities
were gonna take care of it

06:01.213 --> 06:03.966
because the fences were gonna be down
and the quarantine was gonna be over.

06:04.050 --> 06:05.968
But it's not over, Gord.
They lied to us!

06:06.052 --> 06:08.220
But can you prove
that the Creekers are the ones

06:08.304 --> 06:10.848
that actually set fire
to the grocery store?

06:10.932 --> 06:12.809
I don't care about the grocery store.

06:22.610 --> 06:24.612
Ronnie was the last person to text Lana?

06:24.696 --> 06:27.448
He was gonna go meet her
out in the forest.

06:35.497 --> 06:37.667
You're being a pain in the ass.

06:37.750 --> 06:39.418
Somebody has to milk the cows.

06:39.501 --> 06:41.838
Besides, I'll be back in...
a couple hours.

06:41.921 --> 06:45.507
I don't wanna be on the farm by myself.
It freaks me out.

06:45.592 --> 06:47.594
Franny, you're 12 years old.

06:47.677 --> 06:49.386
- [sighs]
- You'll be fine.

06:49.470 --> 06:53.182
Besides, I don't really
have much of a choice.

06:53.265 --> 06:54.266
Yes, you do.

06:54.350 --> 06:57.604
Don't go with that moron, Chuck,
and his Neanderthal friends.

06:57.687 --> 07:00.815
They can beat people up
without you around.

07:00.898 --> 07:02.942
That's exactly what I'm trying to avoid.

07:04.443 --> 07:05.903
I'll see you soon.

07:09.907 --> 07:10.950
[door closes]

07:11.033 --> 07:12.576
[engine starts]

07:20.417 --> 07:22.461
So, can I leave these keys here with you?

07:24.338 --> 07:27.466
I have 67 keys.

07:27.549 --> 07:32.513
Every key that my dad has,
I have the same keys.

07:32.596 --> 07:35.474
It's a different key, but it's the same.

07:35.557 --> 07:37.727
So, then you're the perfect person
to leave these keys with.

07:37.810 --> 07:39.145
- For sure.
- [cell phone vibrating]

07:39.228 --> 07:42.314
I already have the keys
for the supermarket,

07:42.398 --> 07:45.526
and Chuck doesn't have
the keys for the supermarket...

07:45.609 --> 07:49.113
Okay, so I gotta go.
And you're okay here by yourself?

07:49.196 --> 07:50.698
Oh, yeah. My mother lets me go

07:50.782 --> 07:54.618
wherever I want
as long as I text her my location.

07:54.702 --> 07:57.288
Cool! So, I'll see you later.

08:11.218 --> 08:13.763
[cows mooing]

08:13.846 --> 08:15.181
[snarling]

08:15.264 --> 08:17.809
Hello? Anybody out there?

08:26.067 --> 08:28.069
[Pat] I'm sick of being lied to.

08:29.153 --> 08:30.529
Government promised us.

08:30.612 --> 08:34.366
Yeah. One of the kids I sell to says this
is some sort of social experiment.

08:34.450 --> 08:36.159
Like, they're filming all of it.

08:37.328 --> 08:40.414
Congratulations, Ronnie.
That's the dumbest theory I've heard yet.

08:41.832 --> 08:44.085
- [objects clattering]
- [Ronnie] What was that?

08:44.168 --> 08:46.212
I think someone's out there.

08:46.295 --> 08:48.047
[cell phone ringing]

08:50.382 --> 08:51.718
Hello.

08:51.801 --> 08:54.470
[Chuck] We've got the place surrounded.
Bring Ronnie out.

08:57.849 --> 09:00.685
- What've you done now?
- What? Nothing. I was here the whole time.

09:01.728 --> 09:03.312
All right, get in the basement.

09:03.395 --> 09:06.733
Whatever you do, don't show your face.
I'll handle this.

09:06.816 --> 09:07.859
Text the cousins.

09:07.942 --> 09:09.902
Let them know
Chuck's here with some guys.

09:09.986 --> 09:11.320
They're after Ronnie.

09:11.403 --> 09:12.697
[scoffs]

09:16.075 --> 09:17.326
[Chuck breathing heavily]

09:17.409 --> 09:20.329
[Gord] I think we should call this off.
Come back tomorrow morning.

09:20.412 --> 09:21.956
Something doesn't feel right.

09:27.837 --> 09:29.255
Put your hands in the air!

09:31.090 --> 09:33.259
- [Pat] I'm unarmed.
- Where's your brother?

09:33.342 --> 09:35.219
Not here.

09:35.302 --> 09:36.971
So, you wouldn't mind
if we searched inside then.

09:38.139 --> 09:39.431
What's this all about?

09:39.515 --> 09:42.684
Witnesses have him setting fire
to the grocery store

09:42.769 --> 09:45.354
and the texts on Lana's phone
from Ronnie.

09:46.814 --> 09:48.232
So?

09:48.941 --> 09:49.942
She's dead.

09:50.026 --> 09:53.154
Murdered at the same place
they were supposed to meet.

09:53.237 --> 09:55.114
Why should I believe you?

09:55.197 --> 09:57.449
'Cause we have proof.

09:57.533 --> 10:00.661
It's on Lana's phone
and probably on Ronnie's, too.

10:01.662 --> 10:04.081
Right now,
we're just looking to bring Ronnie in

10:04.165 --> 10:05.624
so he can't hurt anyone else.

10:05.707 --> 10:07.877
What do you say, buddy?

10:07.960 --> 10:11.213
You know, I wouldn't be out here
unless I thought this was the right call.

10:12.381 --> 10:15.134
We give him five seconds
or we do it my way.

10:17.344 --> 10:19.096
Five,

10:19.180 --> 10:21.723
four, three...

10:25.102 --> 10:26.979
- It's a trap!
- [gunshots]

10:27.521 --> 10:28.605
Get down! Get down!

10:29.899 --> 10:31.400
[Gord] Chuck, call this off!

10:33.277 --> 10:35.404
Let's get out of here!

10:37.573 --> 10:38.783
[groans]

10:55.216 --> 10:56.926
Let's get you to the pharmacy
to fix you up.

10:57.009 --> 10:59.011
I'm fine.

10:59.095 --> 11:01.305
The bullet just grazed me.

11:01.388 --> 11:04.516
You go deal with your boys,
put the guns away,

11:04.600 --> 11:06.435
and make sure
they don't do anything stupid.

11:06.518 --> 11:09.355
Gord, you're bleeding, okay.
It looks bad.

11:09.438 --> 11:13.109
It's not. And see if you can find out
why the hell nothing's working.

11:14.026 --> 11:16.320
That's our biggest problem right now.

11:16.403 --> 11:18.030
All right.

11:25.162 --> 11:27.081
You could have killed someone, you idiot!

11:27.164 --> 11:29.166
You didn't have to fire on them.
I had it under control.

11:29.250 --> 11:31.085
Yeah, it sure looked that way.

11:31.168 --> 11:33.587
You always have an answer for everything,
don't you, Ronnie?

11:33.670 --> 11:36.798
As if we don't have enough trouble
without you stirring up more?

11:36.883 --> 11:38.342
Not now, Tracey.

11:38.425 --> 11:41.178
- Show me your phone.
- Why?

11:41.262 --> 11:43.805
None of the phones work
ever since all the power went out.

11:43.890 --> 11:46.558
You've still got your texts on your phone
and I wanna see them.

11:46.642 --> 11:48.519
I'm your brother.

11:48.602 --> 11:50.604
You're gonna take Chuck's word over mine?

11:52.148 --> 11:53.690
You haven't denied it.

11:54.525 --> 11:55.860
Then ask me.

11:59.780 --> 12:00.822
[scoffs]

12:09.790 --> 12:10.791

[door opening]

12:51.748 --> 12:53.292
[Melissa] Gord?

12:54.251 --> 12:55.294
Gord.

12:56.628 --> 12:58.297
Oh, my God.

12:59.340 --> 13:00.382
[Gord grunts]

13:00.466 --> 13:02.884
Chuck told me you were here
and that you were fine.

13:02.969 --> 13:05.846
Clearly, you're not.
What do you need me to do to help?

13:07.306 --> 13:08.849
No offense, Mel...

13:09.766 --> 13:11.518
but you couldn't even deliver a baby.

13:11.602 --> 13:13.062
You're not gonna be much help here.
[chuckles]

13:13.145 --> 13:14.981
Shut up. I can sew.

13:17.733 --> 13:18.859
Okay.

13:19.943 --> 13:21.612
Help me with my shirt.

13:24.490 --> 13:25.574
[groaning]

13:35.251 --> 13:38.087
[Chuck] The Creekers
set fire to the supermarket.

13:38.170 --> 13:40.714
You don't think after tonight,
they won't try anything else?

13:41.423 --> 13:45.094
Kevin and I will patrol in the pick-up
and look for anything suspicious.

13:45.177 --> 13:47.096
It's freezing out, Chuck.

13:47.179 --> 13:49.098
Just stay in the car.
Keep the heat on.

13:49.181 --> 13:50.432
We'll take shifts.

13:50.516 --> 13:52.893
Just text me if you hear or see anything.

13:52.976 --> 13:55.312
In case you haven't noticed,
nothing works.

13:56.730 --> 13:57.814
Shit.

13:59.358 --> 14:00.359
Right.

14:02.944 --> 14:04.155
Hey.

14:04.238 --> 14:07.658
These radios should work
until they get the power up and running.

14:08.575 --> 14:09.660
[radio beeps]

14:09.743 --> 14:11.870
- Check one, check two.
- [static crackles]

14:12.954 --> 14:16.542
I know the cell towers are out,
but why aren't the radios working?

14:23.799 --> 14:25.051
[Adam] I'm telling you,

14:25.134 --> 14:28.345
they cut off the power and communications
for a reason.

14:28.429 --> 14:30.806
They're trying to scare us.
Shut us up.

14:31.848 --> 14:33.850
[Wiley sighs]
Listen, Mr. Conspiracy Theory,

14:33.934 --> 14:36.520
what if they really still
just don't know what it is?

14:37.729 --> 14:41.233
But, in the meantime,
if the power stays out,

14:41.317 --> 14:43.819
this is really the best time to do it.

14:43.902 --> 14:45.071
It?

14:45.154 --> 14:46.530
Yeah, escape.

14:48.031 --> 14:49.991
I've already been shot once trying.

14:50.076 --> 14:53.120
Trust me, they're not letting anyone out.

14:53.745 --> 14:55.122
Kids who've gone
to the perimeter say

14:55.206 --> 14:57.833
there are way less guards around
ever since they electrified the fence.

14:57.916 --> 15:01.503
If the power stays out, no cell service,
no communication...

15:03.130 --> 15:05.299
maybe we have a chance.

15:06.883 --> 15:09.261
Who knows how long
the power's gonna be out?

15:09.345 --> 15:14.015
Adam, you said yourself,
we could be stuck here for years.

15:16.935 --> 15:18.770
[Melissa] You ready?

15:18.854 --> 15:20.481
Yeah.

15:20.564 --> 15:22.608
Ready when you are.

15:22.691 --> 15:25.486
[Melissa] You're lucky
the bullet went right through.

15:25.569 --> 15:26.653
[Gord grunts]

15:30.657 --> 15:31.950
[groans]

15:37.873 --> 15:39.750
[Tracey] Ronnie's gone.

15:39.833 --> 15:41.252
He left?

15:41.335 --> 15:43.962
Son of a bitch.
Where'd he go?

15:44.045 --> 15:47.466
There was another text,
after he texted Lana.

15:47.549 --> 15:48.717
Who?

15:52.804 --> 15:55.224
Ronnie sure knows how to pick 'em.

15:56.683 --> 15:58.018
[scoffs]

16:36.973 --> 16:38.016
[gasps]

16:38.099 --> 16:40.311
[shushing]
Stacey, don't.

16:42.604 --> 16:46.024
What are you doing here?
This is Chuck's house, you idiot.

16:46.107 --> 16:47.859
If he walks through that door,
I'm yelling, "Rape."

16:47.943 --> 16:49.736
Please, Stacey, I need your help.

16:49.820 --> 16:51.405
With what, Ronnie?
What did you do?

16:51.488 --> 16:54.032
Nothing. They think I killed Lana.

16:55.075 --> 16:56.117
Yeah, I know.

16:56.202 --> 16:58.078
And you didn't warn me?

16:58.162 --> 17:01.373
After I found it,
it was too late to text you and...

17:01.457 --> 17:03.625
Okay, well, I didn't do it, okay?
You're my alibi.

17:03.709 --> 17:04.792
How?

17:04.876 --> 17:07.421
You know damn well
why I didn't go and meet her.

17:09.839 --> 17:11.383
Yeah, unfortunately, I do.

17:11.467 --> 17:12.675
[sighs]

17:22.978 --> 17:24.230
[door opens]

17:29.150 --> 17:31.195
[Melissa] Hey.
How are you?

17:33.739 --> 17:35.532
[grunts] Alive.

17:37.409 --> 17:38.869
Aren't the kids cold?

17:38.952 --> 17:40.371
Yeah, they're bundled up.

17:42.080 --> 17:45.292
I really thought the power
would've been back on by now.

17:45.376 --> 17:47.919
[sighs] Without heat, we're screwed.

17:48.003 --> 17:51.382
Kids are saying that the military blew
the grid trying to electrify the fence.

17:51.465 --> 17:54.468
Everything is a guess at this point.
But we got bigger problems.

17:55.677 --> 17:58.847
- What now?
- Someone's gonna get shot.

17:58.930 --> 18:02.309
The Dukes are patrolling the town
with guns.

18:02.393 --> 18:03.727
[sighs]

18:03.810 --> 18:05.812
[cows mooing]

18:16.865 --> 18:19.618
Please tell me you've gone home,
Mr. Tiger.

18:19.701 --> 18:21.787
[cows continue mooing]

18:21.870 --> 18:25.541
I know, I know.
I gotta go feed you girls.

18:32.047 --> 18:33.048
Gord...

18:33.965 --> 18:35.133
how you holding up?

18:36.009 --> 18:37.636
What are you doing?

18:37.719 --> 18:39.680
Trying to keep this place safe.

18:39.763 --> 18:41.348
Looking for anything suspicious.

18:41.432 --> 18:42.599
Suspicious?

18:42.683 --> 18:44.393
All I see are scared kids.

18:44.476 --> 18:46.937
They're terrified enough as it is
with the power out,

18:47.020 --> 18:48.229
and no way to reach the outside world.

18:48.314 --> 18:51.525
They don't need you and your guys
walking around here with guns.

18:52.984 --> 18:54.695
I'm not taking orders from you.

19:02.453 --> 19:03.495
[sighs]

19:17.676 --> 19:20.346
- Wake up! Wake up!
- What?

19:20.429 --> 19:23.098
Damn it. What time is it?

19:23.181 --> 19:24.224
[Ronnie sighs]

19:24.308 --> 19:27.227
We have to get back to Chuck's house
before he knows I'm gone.

19:27.311 --> 19:30.146
That ain't gonna happen.
I need you to set the story straight.

19:30.230 --> 19:31.982
I already told you,
I'm not gonna be your alibi.

19:32.065 --> 19:33.984
Why not?

19:34.067 --> 19:35.944
Because what I have with Chuck is good.

19:36.027 --> 19:37.278
Actually, it's great.

19:37.363 --> 19:39.239
- And I'm not gonna throw it away for you.
- Yeah.

19:39.323 --> 19:41.825
If I remember correctly,
you're the one that came on to me.

19:41.908 --> 19:43.118
I was drunk.

19:43.201 --> 19:45.203
Every time? Even last night?

19:47.539 --> 19:48.540
I'm not doing it.

19:48.624 --> 19:50.376
Hey. We have something, okay?

19:50.459 --> 19:53.003
I need your help.
Please.

19:56.965 --> 19:58.800
Okay. Okay.

19:59.968 --> 20:02.679
On one condition.
You don't bring your gun.

20:02.763 --> 20:05.265
- [sighs]
- If Chuck sees it, he will fire first,

20:05.349 --> 20:08.435
and I'm not getting stuck
in some crossfire.

20:17.152 --> 20:18.487
Adam! Hey.

20:19.696 --> 20:21.782
Check this out. Encyclopedias.

20:21.865 --> 20:23.450
It's like the new Internet.

20:23.534 --> 20:25.827
I've been combing through them,
and I found that

20:25.911 --> 20:29.456
there's no real physiological change
between a 21 and a 22-year-old.

20:29.540 --> 20:32.376
Most changes usually happen by 19 or 20,

20:32.459 --> 20:35.045
and even then, they happen
at different ages for each person.

20:35.128 --> 20:37.839
It's just dead end after dead end
with this thing.

20:37.923 --> 20:40.258
Pretty much.

20:40.341 --> 20:42.386
You prepping your next lesson plan?

20:42.469 --> 20:46.014
Yeah. I was thinking about
starting classes again.

20:46.097 --> 20:48.058
What's the point?

20:48.141 --> 20:49.976
Maybe I can help in my own way.

20:50.060 --> 20:53.229
Teach about situations like this
and how they've messed it up before.

20:53.313 --> 20:55.941
Not repeat the same mistakes.

20:56.024 --> 20:59.110
What are the odds on students
coming to school if they don't have to?

20:59.194 --> 21:00.821
Do you wanna lead the charge?

21:00.904 --> 21:04.032
I would, Ms. Symonds, but I'm leaving.

21:05.617 --> 21:08.829
Wiley and I are gonna try and see if
there's a way out while the power's off.

21:10.622 --> 21:13.584
I came here to see if you'd come with us.

21:14.460 --> 21:16.503
We're under quarantine for a reason.

21:18.213 --> 21:19.590
It wouldn't feel right.

21:26.304 --> 21:28.014
Would you relax?

21:28.098 --> 21:29.975
You're with me.
Nothing's gonna happen.

21:30.058 --> 21:31.685
Yeah, I know.
I don't like this at all, okay?

21:31.768 --> 21:33.061
I'm way too exposed.

21:34.229 --> 21:36.648
So, is there some other way
we could do this?

21:36.732 --> 21:39.109
Like a carrier pigeon?
Nothing works.

21:40.276 --> 21:42.195
You'll run into Chuck eventually.

21:42.278 --> 21:44.322
Yeah, that's exactly
what I'm worried about.

21:45.365 --> 21:47.826
Well, you're just gonna have to trust me.

21:47.909 --> 21:49.661
Unless you have another plan.

22:06.261 --> 22:07.721
[sighs]

22:17.313 --> 22:18.565
[cows mooing]

22:18.649 --> 22:21.192
Any of you ladies
seen a tiger around here?

22:24.988 --> 22:26.447
You can't go.

22:26.532 --> 22:28.700
Yes, I can,
and I'm going to.

22:28.784 --> 22:30.661
Pat, just think about it.

22:30.744 --> 22:32.203
I've had all night to think about it.

22:32.287 --> 22:34.498
They believe that
Ronnie killed Chuck's sister!

22:34.581 --> 22:36.667
After the gunshots last night,

22:36.750 --> 22:39.044
the last thing they're gonna wanna see
is a Creeker in town!

22:39.127 --> 22:40.712
He's our brother, I'm going.

22:40.796 --> 22:44.257
Don't play the blood card.
Not when dealing with Ronnie.

22:44.340 --> 22:47.678
[sighs] One thing's for sure,
he makes the rules up as he goes along.

22:47.761 --> 22:50.096
Well, this time,
he's on the right side of them.

22:51.181 --> 22:54.726
Look, all I know is that nothing good is
gonna come from you trying to save him.

22:54.810 --> 22:57.938
And all I know is I won't be able
to live with myself if I don't.

23:04.069 --> 23:06.029
I just wanna know exactly
what you're gonna say to him.

23:06.112 --> 23:08.489
Your paranoia is freaking me out.
Stop it.

23:08.574 --> 23:10.450
Oh, shit, there he is!

23:10.992 --> 23:12.077
[Ronnie grunts]

23:12.160 --> 23:13.369
[Stacey] Chuck! Chuck! Help!

23:14.705 --> 23:15.706
Ronnie's totally lost it!

23:15.789 --> 23:16.915
I thought he was
gonna kill me or something.

23:16.998 --> 23:19.167
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

23:20.210 --> 23:22.629
- Go back to the house okay, Stace?
- Okay.

23:22.713 --> 23:23.922
[Chuck] You guys go that way.

23:24.005 --> 23:25.340
You and I will head
towards the church!

23:25.423 --> 23:26.967
Don't let him get away!

23:28.009 --> 23:29.052
[Franny grunts]

23:29.135 --> 23:30.762
Come on, you stupid generator.

23:31.888 --> 23:33.181
Start.

23:33.264 --> 23:35.058
[generator sputtering]

23:42.816 --> 23:44.610
- [gasps]
- [tiger snarls]

23:44.693 --> 23:46.486
Easy, there.

23:53.451 --> 23:55.161
[children speaking indistinctly]

24:13.013 --> 24:14.430
Stay away!

24:14.514 --> 24:17.142
No, no, no!
Stay away from them!

24:17.225 --> 24:18.852
- Leave them alone!
- [growling]

24:18.935 --> 24:21.604
Those are my girls!

24:21.688 --> 24:22.856
[cows mooing]

24:22.939 --> 24:24.149
That's enough!

24:34.868 --> 24:37.913
Here, um, let me help you.
I'm worried about your stitches.

24:37.996 --> 24:40.040
I'm all right.
These propane heaters are pretty light.

24:40.123 --> 24:42.042
Where's all the older kids?

24:42.125 --> 24:44.711
Where's your sister?
How come she's not with the baby?

24:46.212 --> 24:48.048
Sorry. I shouldn't have said anything.

24:48.131 --> 24:51.051
You know, I often wonder
if one of us was adopted.

24:53.887 --> 24:57.098
Maybe it's, uh...
postpartum or something.

24:57.182 --> 25:00.310
We have literally been strangers
to each other our entire lives.

25:01.895 --> 25:04.230
Uh, just make sure you keep stuff
away from that.

25:04.314 --> 25:07.734
I'm a little worried a kid's gonna forget
and set the whole place on fire.

25:07.818 --> 25:10.403
Yeah. We'll have to be careful.

25:12.113 --> 25:13.489
Yeah.

25:20.747 --> 25:21.873
[Gord sighing]

25:25.251 --> 25:27.337
- We'll search the orphanage.
- All right.

25:27.420 --> 25:28.421
What's going on?

25:29.589 --> 25:32.633
Ronnie's in town.
He attacked Stacey.

25:32.718 --> 25:34.594
- Is she all right?
- Yeah, she's fine.

25:34.677 --> 25:36.554
[Gord sighs]

25:36.637 --> 25:38.139
You know, we could use your help.

25:38.849 --> 25:40.058
[sighs]

25:40.892 --> 25:43.103
I would, but I gotta check on Franny.

25:43.186 --> 25:46.231
She's been alone at the farm
since yesterday.

25:46.314 --> 25:47.733
What's this about, Gord?

25:49.109 --> 25:52.070
You know, you came to the Creekers' house
on your own.

25:52.153 --> 25:53.739
And I brought you back to town.
I tried to help you out.

25:53.822 --> 25:54.990
And what, you're just gonna leave?

25:56.324 --> 25:59.535
- You got your vigilantes.
- What, is that why you're mad?

25:59.619 --> 26:03.289
Because I gave out some guns
and made some decisions that you wouldn't?

26:03.373 --> 26:05.208
You're just afraid.

26:09.420 --> 26:10.922
Do I look afraid?

26:12.883 --> 26:15.551
I'm just trying
to keep everybody safe around here.

26:18.638 --> 26:20.681
You're not doing a very good job.

26:26.146 --> 26:28.564
- [door opens]
- [sighs]

26:39.442 --> 26:41.402
- [Adam] Where's the baby?
- [Wiley] Not coming.

26:42.903 --> 26:43.904
What?

26:45.073 --> 26:47.408
Wiley, I guess I just assumed
you were bringing him.

26:48.326 --> 26:49.952
Look, it's not my baby.

26:50.661 --> 26:53.289
As someone who's got
father-abandonment issues,

26:53.373 --> 26:55.291
are you sure
you're making the best decision?

26:56.751 --> 26:58.961
Adam, don't you think
this is already killing me?

27:00.338 --> 27:02.882
I'm not a mother.
I never intended to be.

27:02.965 --> 27:05.176
I delivered a baby, okay?
That's it.

27:05.260 --> 27:07.803
I wish it were different, but it's not.

27:09.139 --> 27:11.266
Anyway, whenever I see
that baby with Melissa,

27:11.349 --> 27:14.144
there's no question
who should be looking after him.

27:15.103 --> 27:16.729
All I'm saying is that
if there's any doubt...

27:16.812 --> 27:18.439
There isn't.

27:38.334 --> 27:39.544
[object clatters]

27:48.428 --> 27:50.221
- Vince!
- What the hell, Amanda?

27:50.305 --> 27:51.431
Why are you back here?

27:51.514 --> 27:53.433
You wanna have a tea party?

27:53.516 --> 27:54.725
I almost...

27:57.853 --> 27:59.230
Chuck know you're here?

27:59.314 --> 28:03.901
No. I'm supposed to
meet him outside in four minutes.

28:03.984 --> 28:06.279
Yeah, sure.

28:06.362 --> 28:07.988
- Bye, Amanda.
- Bye, Vincent.

28:17.165 --> 28:20.710
I can keep a secret, I told you.

28:20.793 --> 28:23.879
Well, looks like
we're gonna win this game.

28:24.880 --> 28:28.384
Next step, we sneak out of town.

28:29.469 --> 28:31.096
You think you can do that?

28:31.179 --> 28:33.306
- [sighs]
- Let's go.

28:47.112 --> 28:48.863
[Wiley] Are you sure it's safe?

28:48.946 --> 28:51.657
[Adam] It's been over an hour.
There's no guards.

28:54.910 --> 28:56.329
[Wiley breathing heavily]

28:56.412 --> 28:58.123
That's it? You're sure
the power's off on the fence now?

28:58.206 --> 29:00.458
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- Okay.

29:00.541 --> 29:02.335
- Would you hand me the cutters?
- Okay.

29:05.213 --> 29:08.007
- Keep an eye open for guards.
- Okay, I'm watching.

29:10.801 --> 29:12.845
- [Adam] You see anyone?
- No.

29:25.650 --> 29:28.986
See? It worked.
We made it through.

29:29.069 --> 29:32.573
Let's celebrate when we're incognito
back in civilization.

29:32.657 --> 29:34.784
We're not home free.

29:34.867 --> 29:36.286
Hey, stop.

29:36.369 --> 29:37.578
What? We gotta keep going.

29:37.662 --> 29:38.996
Look.

29:40.998 --> 29:44.084
This explains why they aren't worried
about the power going out.

29:51.301 --> 29:52.885
[vehicle approaching]

30:05.047 --> 30:06.757
I, uh... I need your help.

30:06.841 --> 30:09.426
The last time I tried to help you,
I got shot.

30:09.509 --> 30:11.428
I didn't want it to go that way.

30:12.722 --> 30:14.765
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important.

30:14.849 --> 30:16.225
Just give me a ride into town?

30:16.308 --> 30:17.977
You're going after Ronnie?

30:18.060 --> 30:20.062
You know, Chuck's got the whole town
looking for him.

30:20.145 --> 30:21.271
It wasn't him, Gord.

30:22.022 --> 30:23.733
Yeah. Sure.

30:23.816 --> 30:26.360
All right.
See for yourself.

30:27.695 --> 30:30.072
Ronnie was with Stacey.
The texts prove it.

30:31.240 --> 30:32.950
Get in the truck.

30:33.951 --> 30:35.578
[engine starts]

30:38.956 --> 30:40.708
- Anything?
- Nope.

30:42.459 --> 30:43.794
Have you seen my sister?

30:43.878 --> 30:45.921
She was supposed to meet me here
about five minutes ago.

30:46.005 --> 30:47.172
She's never late.

30:47.256 --> 30:48.548
Saw her at the antique shop
up the block.

30:48.633 --> 30:50.134
Yeah? Okay.

30:55.598 --> 30:57.016
Amanda?

30:58.851 --> 31:01.270
Amanda, stop hiding.
You're holding us up.

31:03.147 --> 31:04.857
[Felix] Chuck!

31:06.275 --> 31:07.484
Hey!

31:07.567 --> 31:10.029
Don't move.
Don't take another step.

31:10.112 --> 31:11.822
Ronnie's not playing fair.

31:11.906 --> 31:14.033
Put your guns down.

31:14.116 --> 31:15.993
Okay, put them down!

31:17.577 --> 31:19.079
No, it's obviously a trick.

31:19.163 --> 31:20.706
No way.

31:20.790 --> 31:22.958
Think about everything
the government's done so far.

31:23.042 --> 31:26.253
They've quarantined us,
they've cut off communications.

31:26.336 --> 31:29.548
Why wouldn't they put a minefield
around this place?

31:30.507 --> 31:33.302
Well, I'm willing to test it.

31:33.385 --> 31:34.637
Hey, stop.

31:35.680 --> 31:36.847
Don't test it with your life.

31:37.890 --> 31:39.391
Adam, stop! That's my bag.

31:39.474 --> 31:40.517
Don't!

31:41.852 --> 31:43.395
No!

31:49.068 --> 31:50.277
[Wiley panting]

31:51.278 --> 31:52.863
What the hell did you just do?

31:53.823 --> 31:55.407
That had my money in it.

31:56.408 --> 31:58.744
You had no right to do that.

31:58.828 --> 32:02.164
No? At least we're not dead.

32:03.123 --> 32:05.584
Maybe you might wanna tell me
where all that money came from?

32:05.668 --> 32:07.211
No.

32:07.294 --> 32:09.504
I don't owe you an explanation
for anything.

32:09.588 --> 32:11.340
Yes, you do.

32:12.549 --> 32:14.969
I was willing to risk my life for you.

32:15.052 --> 32:17.221
Look, you wanted out of here
more than anybody, okay?

32:17.304 --> 32:19.306
Don't try and put this on me.

32:42.454 --> 32:43.914
Hey, Mr. Tiger!

32:43.998 --> 32:45.249
I'm out here.

32:48.961 --> 32:50.295
- [tiger roars]
- [gasps]

32:51.338 --> 32:52.798
- [gun fires]
- [roars]

32:57.720 --> 32:59.346
[Franny screams]

33:02.516 --> 33:04.309
[children clamoring]

33:05.936 --> 33:08.438
Guys, can you please stop that now?

33:08.522 --> 33:10.775
Seriously. How old are you?

33:10.858 --> 33:12.860
Literally, every single day?

33:12.943 --> 33:14.153
Sit over there, five minutes.

33:14.236 --> 33:15.946
Put that down!

33:16.030 --> 33:17.281
Right... What are you doing?

33:17.364 --> 33:18.698
Sit over there, please!

33:18.783 --> 33:20.367
- [objects clattering]
- [sighs]

33:33.756 --> 33:35.049
Come on, Wiley.

33:36.133 --> 33:37.802
Silent treatment is stupid.

33:39.719 --> 33:42.597
Well, it's too bad
we can't all be geniuses like you.

33:44.558 --> 33:46.310
That's not what I meant.

33:46.393 --> 33:50.064
Look, everything, including our kiss,
was a mistake, okay?

33:50.147 --> 33:54.318
You just caught me at a weak moment.
I was feeling sorry for you.

33:54.401 --> 33:55.820
[sighs]

33:59.239 --> 34:00.490
I, uh...

34:00.574 --> 34:03.160
I didn't realize
I was taking advantage of you.

34:14.379 --> 34:15.630
See ya.

34:18.092 --> 34:19.384
[sighs]

34:23.347 --> 34:24.556
Put your guns down.

34:24.639 --> 34:26.100
- Put them down!
- [breathing heavily]

34:27.141 --> 34:29.353
- Okay, okay. Just don't hurt her!
- Ow!

34:29.436 --> 34:31.355
I swear to God, if you hurt her,
I'll kill you!

34:32.647 --> 34:33.899
I'm sorry!

34:33.983 --> 34:36.318
Amanda, it's gonna be all right, okay?

34:36.400 --> 34:38.320
I didn't mean to!

34:38.402 --> 34:39.989
It's not your fault.

34:40.072 --> 34:42.157
The fire just started.

34:42.241 --> 34:43.367
[panting]

34:43.449 --> 34:45.409
I tried to stop it.

34:45.494 --> 34:48.705
The box says to cook it for 15 minutes.

34:48.788 --> 34:53.418
[stammering] 15 minutes
is one quarter of an hour.

34:53.502 --> 34:55.212
And then it burned!

34:55.295 --> 34:57.005
I'm sorry, Chuck.

34:58.841 --> 35:00.717
She set the supermarket on fire.

35:02.344 --> 35:03.762
[breathing heavily]

35:03.846 --> 35:05.722
This isn't about the supermarket.

35:05.805 --> 35:07.141
This is about Lana.

35:07.224 --> 35:09.476
I didn't do it, Chuck.
I didn't do any of it.

35:09.559 --> 35:12.187
I was supposed to meet Lana
for a drug deal, but I never went.

35:12.271 --> 35:13.563
All right, I don't have
any other choice, okay?

35:13.647 --> 35:15.232
I don't have any other choice.

35:16.566 --> 35:18.277
You see what you did?

35:18.360 --> 35:20.070
This is your own damn fault
and you know it.

35:20.154 --> 35:23.740
How about you guys give me a gun so that,
when I let Amanda go, it's a fair game?

35:23.823 --> 35:26.493
And then we leave well enough alone.

35:28.037 --> 35:29.079
Okay.

35:30.205 --> 35:31.206
Okay.

35:39.965 --> 35:41.675
It's okay, it's okay.

35:41.758 --> 35:43.218
Take her to Town Hall,
and make sure she's all right.

35:43.302 --> 35:44.386
Yeah, okay.

35:48.348 --> 35:49.683
[Ronnie] Back up.

35:49.766 --> 35:50.935
- Back up. Back up!
- [gun clicks]

35:54.521 --> 35:55.940
Oh, shit.

35:56.023 --> 35:58.775
Never touch my sister again!

36:00.277 --> 36:02.696
- [both grunting]
- [Pat] Hey! Hey!

36:02.779 --> 36:03.822
[Gord] Stop!

36:03.906 --> 36:06.075
Stop it! Hey! Hey!

36:06.158 --> 36:07.617
Hey! Hey!

36:07.701 --> 36:08.911
- Ronnie's innocent.
- [Chuck] No, he's not.

36:08.994 --> 36:11.246
He attacked Amanda
right after he attacked Stacey!

36:11.330 --> 36:13.916
I didn't attack her.
Stacey was my only way out of this.

36:13.999 --> 36:16.585
You weren't here, okay?

36:16.668 --> 36:18.503
You didn't want any part in this.

36:18.587 --> 36:19.671
Show him the phone.

36:19.754 --> 36:21.798
[Pat] Here.

36:21.881 --> 36:25.135
He was supposed to meet Lana,
but he got sidetracked.

36:25.219 --> 36:26.929
He was with your girlfriend.

36:27.012 --> 36:28.931
He was with Stacey all day.

36:31.766 --> 36:33.060
Come on, let's go.
Get in the truck.

36:33.143 --> 36:34.436
[Ronnie] Sure...

36:34.519 --> 36:36.896
I get the shit beat out of me
for no reason, and now this is over?

36:36.981 --> 36:39.274
Ronnie, this ends now!

36:39.358 --> 36:42.027
Screw that.
This just started.

36:45.447 --> 36:46.490
Ronnie!

36:48.408 --> 36:51.245
Chuck, put the guns back
at the police station.

36:52.454 --> 36:53.913
No.

36:53.998 --> 36:56.458
You heard him.
This just started.

36:56.541 --> 36:59.294
- This is stupid.
- Then leave.

37:02.922 --> 37:04.258
[Gord sighs]

37:08.012 --> 37:09.221
[sniffling]

37:12.766 --> 37:14.726
Where the hell have you been?

37:14.809 --> 37:15.810
"Hell..."

37:16.728 --> 37:18.938
that's pretty risqué,
especially in a church.

37:19.023 --> 37:21.775
[sighs] Not now, Wiley.
Please, not now.

37:21.858 --> 37:23.818
Yeah, I was gonna say
the same thing to you.

37:26.030 --> 37:27.572
Sure.

37:27.656 --> 37:31.910
Yeah, whatever.
Because, clearly... you don't give a shit.

37:33.078 --> 37:35.372
You're not the one that lifts a finger.

37:35.455 --> 37:38.000
You're not the one
that does a damn thing for anyone.

37:38.083 --> 37:41.961
Literally, all you do is sit around
feeling sorry for yourself.

37:42.046 --> 37:43.755
I didn't ask you for anything.

37:45.299 --> 37:46.300
No.

37:47.467 --> 37:49.803
No, you didn't,
but you sure expected it.

37:51.638 --> 37:54.641
We are in the middle of a quarantine...
in a crisis,

37:54.724 --> 37:58.395
and every day, all day,
I am looking after your baby,

37:58.478 --> 38:00.564
and do I get a thanks?
No.

38:00.647 --> 38:01.898
No, of course not,

38:01.981 --> 38:06.153
because Wiley is throwing herself
the biggest pity party.

38:06.236 --> 38:09.614
And maybe she's gonna snap out of it,
but maybe she's not.

38:10.740 --> 38:12.659
And we're the ones
that get to deal with it.

38:12.742 --> 38:14.703
Oh, screw you, Melissa!

38:15.912 --> 38:18.582
Trust me, you are not gonna
have to deal with me anymore!

38:42.647 --> 38:45.150
There... all better.

38:45.434 --> 38:46.851
- All better.
- Yeah.

38:46.935 --> 38:48.395
Hey.

38:48.478 --> 38:50.522
Hi. Let me see.

38:50.605 --> 38:52.399
I did not like that game.

38:52.682 --> 38:53.933
Me neither.

38:54.017 --> 38:55.434
Are you all right?

38:56.520 --> 38:57.937
Are you mad at me?

38:58.021 --> 38:59.564
For the supermarket?

38:59.648 --> 39:00.982
It wasn't my fault.

39:01.065 --> 39:03.568
No, no, no.
Amanda, I know.

39:03.652 --> 39:05.069
I know. I'm not mad.

39:05.153 --> 39:07.822
Can we go home now?

39:07.906 --> 39:09.032
Yeah.

39:10.074 --> 39:12.451
Just, um, wait outside
and I'll be right out.

39:13.620 --> 39:15.539
Five minutes?

39:16.455 --> 39:18.750
Four minutes and 34 seconds.

39:24.463 --> 39:26.090
- [door opening]
- That was pretty close.

39:27.926 --> 39:29.761
You... lied to me.

39:30.679 --> 39:33.181
- You were with Ronnie.
- No. I don't...

39:33.264 --> 39:36.225
I don't know what he told you,
but you can't trust him, Chuck.

39:36.309 --> 39:38.311
[breathing heavily]

39:39.813 --> 39:43.066
You know, I was saying to myself
on the way here, I said that,

39:43.149 --> 39:46.319
if you tell me the truth,
then I can't be with you,

39:46.402 --> 39:48.362
but I can look after you.

39:49.280 --> 39:50.990
What are you talking about?
I don't...

39:51.074 --> 39:53.409
I mean... [scoffs]

39:53.492 --> 39:54.828
You know...

39:55.745 --> 39:57.288
you didn't.

39:58.873 --> 40:00.291
[sighs]

40:00.374 --> 40:02.210
- Chuck...
- I'm done with you.

40:03.920 --> 40:04.963
Are you serious?

40:05.880 --> 40:08.507
Yeah. You can't be trusted.

40:08.592 --> 40:09.759
You're on your own.

40:40.790 --> 40:42.041
Franny!

40:43.542 --> 40:44.753
[sighs]

40:46.755 --> 40:48.131
[sighs]

40:51.550 --> 40:53.678
Thank goodness you're okay.

40:53.762 --> 40:55.889
Gord, I'm not good at this stuff.

40:56.806 --> 40:58.516
What are you talking about?

40:59.517 --> 41:03.688
Both Dad and Granddad
would be so proud of you right now.

41:03.772 --> 41:04.773
Really?

41:06.024 --> 41:08.693
Yes, really.

41:09.485 --> 41:11.070
[sighs]

41:21.873 --> 41:24.125
[music playing on truck stereo]

41:34.052 --> 41:35.178
Who are you?

41:35.261 --> 41:36.846
[music stops]

41:36.930 --> 41:38.181
Santa Claus.

41:39.432 --> 41:41.225
Christmas came early.

41:50.694 --> 41:52.904
Wiley, you shouldn't be out here
with the baby.

41:54.113 --> 41:55.489
Ronnie, what happened to you?

41:55.573 --> 41:56.658
[sighs]

41:56.741 --> 41:58.284
It's nothing worth talking about.

41:59.786 --> 42:02.413
It's late.
You know, it's getting cold.

42:02.496 --> 42:04.623
Where you off to?

42:04.708 --> 42:06.375
Actually, I was just walking.

42:07.251 --> 42:08.753
No destination?

42:10.046 --> 42:11.172
Not yet.

42:12.506 --> 42:16.510
You can always stay at our place.
Even if it's just for the night.

42:19.013 --> 42:21.349
- Why not?
- Exactly.

42:22.475 --> 42:23.935
Why not?

42:25.854 --> 42:28.481
Come on, it's that way.
