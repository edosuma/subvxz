00:51.092 --> 00:52.218
Where are you going?

00:52.302 --> 00:53.845
To make you breakfast.

00:54.512 --> 00:55.430
Stay here.

01:00.518 --> 01:01.895
I'll be right back.

01:31.049 --> 01:32.092
Good day.

01:33.635 --> 01:34.969
Your husband, please?

01:35.053 --> 01:36.930
He is resting, Major.

01:42.727 --> 01:43.937
What are you doing?

01:45.313 --> 01:47.107
Who? Who are you?

01:52.070 --> 01:53.822
What's going on here?

01:54.948 --> 01:55.907
Darling.

02:02.539 --> 02:03.957
What is going on?

02:08.503 --> 02:09.838
On the 20th of March,

02:10.421 --> 02:11.548
I issued an order

02:11.631 --> 02:14.467
that all military personnel
in Aschaffenburg

02:14.551 --> 02:19.180
must report to reserve units
within 24 hours for defense of the city.

02:20.473 --> 02:23.268
Lieutenant Heymann is in violation
of those orders.

02:23.351 --> 02:26.146
-Major, I am recovering from wounds--
-Your wounds are not my concern.

02:26.938 --> 02:31.401
Your actions indicate that you are
a coward and a traitor to the Reich,

02:31.484 --> 02:34.445
and, as such, constitute a threat
not only to this city,

02:34.529 --> 02:35.697
but to our country.

02:36.281 --> 02:38.449
-What are you doing?
-Your husband is a traitor.

02:38.533 --> 02:39.367
No.

02:40.034 --> 02:44.831
He is hereby found guilty of desertion
and sentenced to death.

02:46.332 --> 02:49.627
He isn't a traitor, he is a war hero.

02:50.587 --> 02:54.424
Here. His orders, from the doctor!

02:58.469 --> 03:00.680
No! No!

03:03.600 --> 03:06.269
Please, let him go!

03:06.853 --> 03:10.565
My orders are to be obeyed by everyone!

03:10.648 --> 03:12.108
Please, let him go!

03:12.192 --> 03:13.860
There will be no exceptions.

03:18.489 --> 03:20.533
Let him go! Please!

03:21.284 --> 03:24.871
No! No!

03:27.665 --> 03:32.128
Removal of this traitor's body
is prohibited.

03:32.837 --> 03:35.840
Anyone violating that order
will be executed.

11:58.384 --> 11:59.510
Watch out!

12:01.887 --> 12:02.847
No! Please, no!

12:04.515 --> 12:05.766
No! No! No!

12:17.695 --> 12:18.779
Butchers!

12:19.739 --> 12:21.282
Pigs!

15:14.538 --> 15:15.539
Please.

18:36.907 --> 18:37.783
Come on.

18:44.832 --> 18:45.707
Asshole.

18:52.256 --> 18:53.090
Shit.

19:40.596 --> 19:41.763
Idiot…

20:46.495 --> 20:50.332
These are good men.

20:53.001 --> 20:54.044
Your men.

22:20.088 --> 22:23.717
Please. Please help my husband.

22:57.918 --> 22:59.503
He threatened everyone.

24:01.857 --> 24:03.859
Citizens of Aschaffenburg…

24:05.193 --> 24:06.570
put down your weapons.

24:08.071 --> 24:09.406
The fighting is over.

24:10.866 --> 24:12.576
As of 09:00 hours this morning…

24:13.410 --> 24:16.663
we have ended all hostilities
with the allied forces.

24:17.622 --> 24:19.624
Citizens of Aschaffenburg…

24:20.917 --> 24:22.669
put down your weapons.

24:22.752 --> 24:24.045
The fighting is over.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.549
As of 09:00 hours this morning

24:27.632 --> 24:29.468
we have ended all hostilities--

24:39.603 --> 24:41.980
He was a hero! You are a coward!

34:44.165 --> 34:45.374
Get on the ground!
