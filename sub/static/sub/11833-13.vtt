00:01.867 --> 00:03.670
Previously on The Practice:

00:03.703 --> 00:05.305
They found her body
in your car.

00:05.338 --> 00:08.642
I did not kill that woman.
I never met that woman.

00:08.675 --> 00:10.711
You really expect me
to cooperate with someone

00:10.744 --> 00:12.779
trying to help the man
who murdered my wife?

00:12.813 --> 00:14.548
You don't know me,
Mr. Kingman.

00:14.581 --> 00:17.283
You are soliciting
the widower of the victim.

00:17.317 --> 00:19.252
Won't they ask me
about his affair?

00:19.285 --> 00:20.654
He claims
there was none.

00:20.687 --> 00:22.088
You don't believe him
on that?

00:22.122 --> 00:23.624
Not necessarily, no.

00:23.657 --> 00:26.392
Mr. Donnell, I don't know how
you do things in Massachusetts,

00:26.426 --> 00:28.562
but we're a little
different in California,

00:28.595 --> 00:29.630
and when a case has
already been con--

00:29.663 --> 00:30.463
Your Honor, I--

00:30.496 --> 00:33.667
This case is set
for trial on Thursday.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.268
Either you can join us,

00:35.301 --> 00:37.804
or you can go back
to Massachusetts.

00:37.838 --> 00:39.239
You think I didn't check
you people out?

00:39.272 --> 00:42.108
Plan "B"? You pull
the crap in this court

00:42.142 --> 00:43.544
that you regularly pull
in Boston,

00:43.577 --> 00:46.312
and you will be doing
more time than Mr. Mills.

00:46.713 --> 00:48.448
It's just
a simple question, ma'am.

00:48.481 --> 00:51.685
Simple question?
Where was I on the night
my sister was murdered?

00:51.718 --> 00:54.821
Well, here's a simple response--
Go to hell!

00:54.855 --> 00:56.790
I told him, I just send this
stuff. It means nothing.

00:56.823 --> 00:58.424
What do you write
in your e-mails?

00:58.458 --> 01:00.694
That I was going
to kill her and stuff.

01:00.727 --> 01:03.730
I'm just doing
a little background
on all the state witnesses.

01:03.764 --> 01:05.799
Well, maybe I could do some
background checks of my own.

01:05.832 --> 01:07.267
Is that a threat, Detective?

01:07.300 --> 01:08.669
If you did your homework,
you'd know I'm in AA,

01:08.702 --> 01:11.204
and I have been for six
months, bottom-feeding grime.

01:11.237 --> 01:13.540
Oh, gee, just a picture
of our client standing

01:13.574 --> 01:16.142
with the victim-- the woman
he never met in person.

01:16.176 --> 01:18.178
That picture is real,
it's not a trick,

01:18.211 --> 01:19.379
and it's evidence
that you met this--

01:19.412 --> 01:20.681
No!

01:21.882 --> 01:23.283
(door lock buzzing)

01:27.287 --> 01:29.623
It's the glasses.
You can't remember anybody

01:29.656 --> 01:31.391
handing you eyeglasses, or--

01:31.424 --> 01:33.760
You've been asking me that
for three days, Lindsay.

01:33.794 --> 01:35.662
The problem is the jury
will be asking it.

01:35.696 --> 01:37.698
If we can't account
for how your fingerprints

01:37.731 --> 01:39.332
ended up in that house--

01:39.365 --> 01:40.667
You don't think I'd love
to account for it?

01:40.701 --> 01:42.569
Maybe a woman
spilled her purse.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.738
Maybe you helped
pick up the contents,

01:44.771 --> 01:46.507
or someone left glasses
on your desk.

01:46.540 --> 01:49.876
All possible, but we're
going back almost a year.

01:49.910 --> 01:53.379
I mean, if it happened,
I just don't remember it.

01:55.749 --> 01:57.684
Well, at least he's honest.

01:57.718 --> 01:59.419
He's also dead.

01:59.452 --> 02:01.454
We can explain away the body
in his car trunk, maybe.

02:01.487 --> 02:03.156
Even that's a long shot.

02:03.189 --> 02:05.792
But those glasses were
found in a locked desk.

02:07.327 --> 02:10.263
I say we go with Kingman--
the husband.

02:10.295 --> 02:12.899
We can't accuse the widower.
We'll be monsters.

02:12.933 --> 02:14.868
There's rumors he was
having some affairs.

02:14.901 --> 02:16.870
Old rumors,
which we can't confirm.

02:16.903 --> 02:19.305
He could have easily
discovered the e-mails,

02:19.339 --> 02:20.541
traced them to Dennis.

02:20.574 --> 02:22.475
He has an alibi.
How many times--

02:22.509 --> 02:23.810
Maybe he hired somebody.

02:23.844 --> 02:24.811
It's too risky
to go with that.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.279
If we fall on our face--

02:26.312 --> 02:28.481
Is anybody here
pretending we're not desperate?

02:28.515 --> 02:31.251
The trial starts in ten hours.
We got nothing.

02:31.284 --> 02:32.919
If our guy didn't do it,

02:32.953 --> 02:35.522
which is what we all
want to believe,

02:35.556 --> 02:38.925
the most likely candidate
is the husband.

02:38.959 --> 02:40.661
I say we go with plan "B."

02:40.694 --> 02:42.428
You just love plan "B."

02:42.462 --> 02:44.531
It's our only option.
It's not that I like--

02:44.565 --> 02:45.966
Do you have any idea what
the judge will do to us

02:45.999 --> 02:47.400
if we accuse
the widower?

02:47.433 --> 02:49.736
Lindsay, look at that board.

02:49.770 --> 02:52.305
Body, murder weapon,
fingerprints.

02:52.338 --> 02:53.707
How does our client
look to you?

02:54.741 --> 02:56.276
Guilty.

02:56.309 --> 02:58.512
That's how he looks
to the world.

02:58.545 --> 03:00.847
Maybe because he is.
And if he's not,

03:00.881 --> 03:03.349
the next best choice
is the husband.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.887
Plan "B," no question.

03:14.928 --> 03:17.297
(music playing)

03:59.973 --> 04:02.643
It's in the Adelstein file
under "prior bad acts."

04:02.676 --> 04:04.511
There's a memorandum,
a list of cases

04:04.545 --> 04:05.779
which I need you
to run through Westlaw

04:05.812 --> 04:07.581
and fax me
anything you get.

04:07.614 --> 04:08.949
REBECCA (over phone): Do you
want me to draft the motion?

04:08.982 --> 04:10.283
No, just the research.

04:10.316 --> 04:11.384
We'll wing the motion
at the trial.

04:11.417 --> 04:13.053
And, Rebecca,
we need it today.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.254
All right, listen up.

04:17.757 --> 04:18.959
I'll open, which will be short.

04:18.992 --> 04:20.761
I don't want to tip
our strategy.

04:20.793 --> 04:22.829
Ellenor, the photographer's
up first, he's yours.

04:22.863 --> 04:25.331
Next comes
the detective. Jimmy?

04:25.365 --> 04:26.967
I'm ready.
He's the key.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.603
His reputation for being lazy,
you have to play that up,

04:29.636 --> 04:30.671
but you can't look
like you've got a grudge.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.939
I'm going to be all sweet
right up until I kill him.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.575
Bobby, you've got Brickman,

04:34.608 --> 04:36.810
the schoolteacher
if we need him, and Dennis.

04:36.843 --> 04:38.745
You'll also close.
Ellenor, you've got the nun

04:38.779 --> 04:39.980
on cross if they call her.

04:40.013 --> 04:41.447
You'll also take
the pathologist.

04:41.481 --> 04:42.883
I've got Dennis's wife.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.651
What have we left out?

04:44.685 --> 04:46.052
The judge.

04:46.086 --> 04:47.621
Right. We do not
antagonize him.

04:47.654 --> 04:48.989
We do not interrupt him.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.557
Don't worry.

04:50.591 --> 04:53.527
Okay, again,
soft plan "B."

04:53.560 --> 04:56.663
Everything we do
in that room is to set up
reasonable doubt, period.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.064
We're not going in
to convict Kingman.

04:58.098 --> 04:59.900
We just need to
preserve the question.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.401
It's all about setting up
Bobby's closing.

05:01.434 --> 05:03.837
Nobody pushes.
We stay contained.

05:03.870 --> 05:05.438
If there's a disagreement
in the room,

05:05.471 --> 05:06.973
I make the call,
I'm first chair.

05:07.007 --> 05:09.042
Scream at me
in the corridor if you want,

05:09.075 --> 05:10.577
but in the room,
don't argue.

05:12.813 --> 05:13.814
Any questions?

05:13.847 --> 05:15.582
Can I go
to the beach?

05:15.616 --> 05:17.050
ALL: No.

05:17.083 --> 05:19.953
You're the 13th juror.
I want you keeping score.

05:20.887 --> 05:22.989
Okay. Let's pack up.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.625
One more thing.

05:25.859 --> 05:28.629
I know you all flew out here
to support me,

05:28.662 --> 05:31.798
and I'm grateful.
But he is innocent.

05:31.832 --> 05:35.869
I realize you may not
necessarily believe that,
but I know it,

05:35.902 --> 05:38.438
and I need you to trust
that I know it.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.577
Let's go.

05:45.912 --> 05:50.784
With this hammer, he repeatedly
struck her in the head,

05:50.817 --> 05:52.485
brutally killing her.

05:52.519 --> 05:55.021
He then stuffed her body
in the trunk of his car

05:55.055 --> 05:57.123
and buried this weapon
in his garage.

05:57.157 --> 05:59.893
We will show you
e-mail correspondence

05:59.926 --> 06:02.529
between the victim
and the defendant--

06:02.563 --> 06:05.999
correspondence which is sexual
and even violent.

06:07.467 --> 06:10.537
We will introduce evidence
that establishes

06:10.571 --> 06:12.606
the defendant's presence
in the victim's home.

06:15.175 --> 06:18.745
Now, did anyone actually see
Dennis Mills swing this hammer?

06:19.646 --> 06:20.947
Only Stacey Kingman.

06:22.182 --> 06:24.017
But she didn't live
to tell you about it.

06:26.186 --> 06:27.654
LINDSAY: There's a reason
the district attorney

06:27.688 --> 06:29.823
put these posters up here
for you to see.

06:29.856 --> 06:33.159
A reason he waves the murder
weapon in front of your faces.

06:33.193 --> 06:35.662
He wants you
to be horrified.

06:35.696 --> 06:38.665
He wants your emotion.
He needs it. Why?

06:38.699 --> 06:42.903
Because he can't get
a conviction on the facts alone.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.538
Yes, Dennis Mills had
a relationship

06:44.571 --> 06:46.573
with Stacey Kingman
on the Internet.

06:46.607 --> 06:49.175
They had a sexual
Walter Mitty-esque affair

06:49.209 --> 06:53.079
communicating by e-mail,
but they never met.

06:53.113 --> 06:55.549
Somebody discovered
this e-mail correspondence

06:55.582 --> 06:57.784
and seized upon it
as an opportunity

06:57.818 --> 07:00.220
to kill Stacey Kingman
and frame Dennis Mills.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.823
Somebody else
swung that hammer,

07:02.856 --> 07:04.457
put the body
in my client's trunk,

07:04.490 --> 07:06.159
hid the weapon
in his garage.

07:07.661 --> 07:10.531
I'm not gonna tell you to look
away from these pictures.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.199
They are horrifying.

07:13.233 --> 07:16.537
I won't pretend
this thing wasn't used

07:16.570 --> 07:19.439
to bash in a woman's skull.
It was.

07:20.707 --> 07:22.676
But not by Dennis Mills.

07:22.709 --> 07:26.747
Dennis Mills has been framed
for a crime he didn't commit.

07:31.518 --> 07:33.820
RYDELL: As you can see,
they're right next
to each other.

07:33.854 --> 07:36.723
Mr. Rydell, why did
you take this picture?

07:36.757 --> 07:39.259
I was hired by the museum,
which I frequently am,

07:39.292 --> 07:41.161
to cover various
exhibit openings.

07:41.194 --> 07:43.564
I take stills
for publicity,

07:43.597 --> 07:45.732
or sometimes
for their own catalogs.

07:45.766 --> 07:47.267
Could you tell the court
when the picture was taken?

07:47.300 --> 07:49.269
May 10th of 1999.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.572
For the record,
that would be two days

07:51.605 --> 07:52.739
before Mrs. Kingman's
death?

07:52.773 --> 07:53.907
Yes.

07:53.940 --> 07:55.709
Thank you, sir.
That's all I have.

07:59.646 --> 08:00.914
Mr. Rydell...

08:01.848 --> 08:04.084
Mr. Mills appears
to be standing

08:04.117 --> 08:06.953
two feet in front
of Mrs. Kingman here.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.254
Would that be
a fair assessment?

08:09.556 --> 08:10.991
RYDELL: I believe it would.

08:11.024 --> 08:13.860
So they're not really
standing side-by-side,
are they?

08:13.894 --> 08:15.862
Uh, not in that photo, no.

08:15.896 --> 08:17.097
Do you have
any photographs

08:17.130 --> 08:18.665
where they are
standing side-by-side?

08:19.265 --> 08:20.667
No.

08:20.701 --> 08:22.636
So they're not really
next to each other,

08:22.669 --> 08:23.970
as you testified.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.639
They're close
to each other.

08:25.672 --> 08:26.907
Mr. Rydell...

08:28.341 --> 08:31.311
You never saw my
client and Mrs. Kingman

08:31.344 --> 08:34.179
actually speak
to each other, did you?

08:35.181 --> 08:37.017
Did I see them speak
to each other?

08:39.219 --> 08:43.023
Yes, did you see them
talk to each other?

08:49.129 --> 08:52.098
I don't think so.
If I did, I don't remember.

08:52.132 --> 08:54.601
So it is entirely possible

08:54.635 --> 08:56.269
that Mr. Mills
and Mrs. Kingman

08:56.302 --> 08:58.839
were simply two patrons
at the same art opening

08:58.872 --> 09:00.173
who, at one time,
were standing

09:00.206 --> 09:01.675
proximately close
to one another.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.209
Isn't that possible?

09:03.243 --> 09:04.811
Yes.

09:04.845 --> 09:06.680
Thank you, sir.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.314
That's all I have.

09:10.751 --> 09:13.319
You may step down.
Mr. Fox?

09:14.755 --> 09:16.657
The people call
Steven Mack, Your Honor.

09:16.690 --> 09:19.192
Objection. This witness
is not listed.

09:19.225 --> 09:20.861
Oh, he's not really
a witness, Your Honor.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.095
I'm calling him
simply to read

09:22.128 --> 09:23.697
the e-mail correspondence
into evidence.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.198
Objection.
Overruled.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.701
Sidebar, Your Honor?
Denied.

09:27.734 --> 09:28.935
You're denying a sidebar?

09:28.969 --> 09:31.004
Yes, I am.
Step up, Mr. Mack.

09:31.037 --> 09:32.939
The defense brings at this
time a motion in limine

09:32.973 --> 09:34.741
seeking to suppress
the e-mail correspondence.

09:34.775 --> 09:36.342
That's a pretrial motion,
counsel.

09:36.376 --> 09:38.378
We're in trial,
or had that escaped you?

09:38.411 --> 09:39.980
We're raising it again
at trial.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.247
Denied.
Sidebar.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.684
Denied. Go and rejoin
your group.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.987
Let's go.
We're walking out.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.021
What?

09:48.054 --> 09:48.989
Just do it. Let's go.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.263
Where do you think
you're going?

09:57.297 --> 09:59.866
Back to Massachusetts,
Your Honor.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.367
If you leave this room,

10:01.401 --> 10:04.037
I will hold all four
of you in contempt.

10:04.070 --> 10:06.006
If we're gonna
stay in this room,

10:06.039 --> 10:07.407
then you will deal with us.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.175
Now either you give me
a sidebar right now,

10:09.209 --> 10:11.678
adjourn to chambers,
or we'll take the jail cell,

10:11.712 --> 10:13.914
in which case
you'll have to start
this trial all over again.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.785
Members of the jury,

10:18.819 --> 10:21.021
we will take
a five-minute recess.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.368
I don't mean
to show disrespect,

10:35.401 --> 10:38.071
but we cannot tolerate
you disrespecting us.

10:38.104 --> 10:40.907
We plan to renew
our motion in limine
concerning those letters.

10:40.941 --> 10:42.242
This should have
been pretrial.

10:42.275 --> 10:43.910
Attorney Jacobs
was derelict

10:43.944 --> 10:45.311
in his preparation
for this case.

10:45.345 --> 10:47.213
I would think you could take
judicial notice of that.

10:47.247 --> 10:49.382
He didn't file
any motions to suppress.

10:49.415 --> 10:51.384
His failure to try
to limit the admissibility

10:51.417 --> 10:53.286
of these letters
is gross malpractice.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.155
I assure you, he wouldn't
have prevailed.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.357
We would like
to be heard on the matter,

10:57.390 --> 10:59.159
and we would like
additional time to prepare.

10:59.192 --> 11:01.995
Otherwise, we will file
an interlocutory appeal

11:02.028 --> 11:03.764
and get the time
that way.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.905
Mr. Fox,
call your next witness.

11:11.938 --> 11:13.473
Tomorrow morning before
we bring in the jury,

11:13.507 --> 11:15.075
I will hear
the defendant's motion

11:15.108 --> 11:17.678
to suppress the e-mail.
Let's go.

11:20.747 --> 11:24.084
Counsel, one more stunt
like that,

11:24.117 --> 11:25.385
I will jail you,

11:25.418 --> 11:28.088
and the others will
continue without you.

11:37.531 --> 11:39.966
I thought you said
don't aggravate the guy.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.768
We can't let him
push us around, either.

11:41.802 --> 11:43.303
Doaks is up next.
You ready, jimmy?

11:43.336 --> 11:44.905
I'm ready.

11:44.938 --> 11:46.873
Why does everybody keep
asking if I'm ready?

11:46.907 --> 11:48.208
Well, we'd sort of
like to know.

11:48.241 --> 11:50.877
(sighs) I need to get air.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.379
He's not ready.
Is he okay?

11:53.413 --> 11:56.116
He's fine. He's best
when he's nervous.

11:56.149 --> 11:58.384
He better be fine.
This is their key witness.

11:58.418 --> 12:00.020
(elevator dings)

12:10.296 --> 12:12.265
You're looking
a little ashen, counsel.

12:12.298 --> 12:15.068
You worrying about me?

12:15.101 --> 12:16.903
You're the one
getting in that chair.

12:21.007 --> 12:22.809
(elevator shuts down)

12:22.843 --> 12:24.010
You'd be smart
to get up and down

12:24.044 --> 12:26.012
as fast as you can,
you fat fart.

12:26.046 --> 12:28.348
I've been sitting
in that chair for 20 years.

12:28.381 --> 12:31.384
I've bested F. Lee Bailey,
Johnnie Cochran.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.854
I think I can handle
Jimmy the Grunt.

12:33.887 --> 12:36.122
I told you
I'd check you out.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.424
You're a hack.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.962
You don't think
I'll get you?

12:41.995 --> 12:43.396
I'll get you.

12:43.429 --> 12:47.500
(scoffs)
Whatever you say, Jimbo.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.583
We found the body
inside the trunk.

13:02.616 --> 13:04.184
Were you able
to identify her?

13:04.217 --> 13:07.821
Her purse and identification
were also in the trunk.

13:07.854 --> 13:10.557
We notified her husband,
brought him to the scene,

13:10.591 --> 13:13.026
where he identified
the victim as his wife.

13:13.059 --> 13:14.427
And what happened next?

13:14.460 --> 13:16.530
We searched the premises
of the defendant,

13:16.563 --> 13:19.032
which turned up a hammer
wrapped in plastic

13:19.065 --> 13:21.134
that was later determined
to be the weapon

13:21.167 --> 13:22.468
used to murder
Mrs. Kingman.

13:22.503 --> 13:24.337
We subsequently searched
the victim's house,

13:24.370 --> 13:25.506
dusting for fingerprints.

13:25.539 --> 13:27.173
And what did you find,
Detective?

13:27.207 --> 13:28.909
We lifted three prints

13:28.942 --> 13:32.012
off a lens of Mrs. Kingman's
eyeglasses that belonged

13:32.045 --> 13:33.947
to the defendant,
Dennis Mills.

13:33.980 --> 13:36.316
FOX: And where did you
find those eyeglasses?

13:36.349 --> 13:38.318
Inside Mrs. Kingman's desk.

13:38.351 --> 13:41.321
We also found in the desk
a manila envelope

13:41.354 --> 13:45.258
containing printed e-mails
to the victim from an alias

13:45.291 --> 13:47.460
that was later identified
to be the defendant.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.996
FOX: Thank you, sir.
Reserve the right to recall.

13:56.069 --> 13:59.540
Good afternoon, Detective.
My name is James Berluti.

13:59.573 --> 14:01.542
We've actually met.

14:01.575 --> 14:04.044
How are you today, sir?
Fine.

14:04.077 --> 14:06.146
You said you searched
my client's premises.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.013
Why did you do that?

14:07.047 --> 14:09.650
Because we found
a dead body in his car.

14:09.683 --> 14:13.620
I see. Did you consider maybe
somebody else put it there?

14:13.654 --> 14:15.255
We ruled out the possibility.

14:15.288 --> 14:17.357
Does that mean that you
considered it or you didn't?

14:17.390 --> 14:19.125
We considered it
and ruled it out.

14:19.159 --> 14:20.360
Why?

14:20.393 --> 14:21.962
Because the body
was in his car.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.363
You didn't take him
to the police station

14:23.396 --> 14:25.666
for questioning, you just
arrested him on the spot.

14:25.699 --> 14:28.635
Yes.
Then found the hammer,
then the eyeglasses.

14:28.669 --> 14:29.369
Correct.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.505
Open and shut,
right, Detective?

14:31.538 --> 14:33.306
Objection.
Sustained.

14:33.339 --> 14:35.175
After you found
the hammer, you said,

14:35.208 --> 14:37.511
in front of various officers,
"We got him."

14:37.544 --> 14:39.045
Did you not say that?

14:39.079 --> 14:40.280
I was referring
to the fact

14:40.313 --> 14:41.982
that we had a suspect
in custody.

14:42.015 --> 14:43.917
Oh, you meant
in custody.

14:43.950 --> 14:45.118
Yes.

14:45.151 --> 14:47.287
But Dennis Mills
was already in custody

14:47.320 --> 14:49.389
before you went
into the garage.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.191
Then you come out
with a hammer

14:51.224 --> 14:54.127
in an evidence bag,
saying, "We got him."

14:54.160 --> 14:55.562
Saying it to the officers

14:55.596 --> 14:57.598
who already had
my client in custody.

14:58.464 --> 14:59.566
Why would you tell
the officers

14:59.600 --> 15:01.434
who had my client in custody

15:01.467 --> 15:03.369
that you now had him in custody?

15:05.371 --> 15:06.973
Is it possible
you said it

15:07.007 --> 15:08.942
meaning you got
the guy nailed,

15:08.975 --> 15:09.910
something like that?

15:09.943 --> 15:12.278
I could have been
saying it in that context.

15:12.312 --> 15:13.346
I really don't remember.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.950
You have a reputation
at your department

15:16.983 --> 15:19.085
for being a little lazy,
don't you, Detective?

15:19.119 --> 15:20.621
You want to compare
reputations, counselor?

15:20.654 --> 15:21.522
Objection.
Sustained.

15:21.555 --> 15:24.024
We're not going
to get into reputations.

15:24.057 --> 15:27.227
This case was a snap,
wasn't it, Detective?

15:27.260 --> 15:30.697
You didn't even look
into the idea of other suspects.

15:30.731 --> 15:34.100
We investigated this case
fully, Mr. Berluti.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.969
JIMMY: You investigated
it fully.

15:36.002 --> 15:38.572
This chat room that my client
and the victim had been in--

15:38.605 --> 15:41.174
how many other people
were in it?

15:41.207 --> 15:42.342
Many.

15:42.375 --> 15:43.644
Many?

15:43.677 --> 15:45.512
Over 20.
Isn't that right, Detective?

15:45.546 --> 15:48.381
I believe so.
You talk to all of them?

15:48.414 --> 15:51.217
We were unable to find
them all. Most use aliases.

15:51.251 --> 15:53.386
Of the people you did find,

15:53.419 --> 15:55.722
run checks on where they all
were the evening of may 12th?

15:57.691 --> 15:59.993
You didn't do that,
did you, Detective?

16:00.026 --> 16:03.229
Well, some of them we quickly
eliminated as suspects.

16:03.263 --> 16:05.265
Isn't it true Dennis Mills

16:05.298 --> 16:07.200
is the only guy
you put in your scopes?

16:07.233 --> 16:10.470
That is not true.
There were other people
you bothered to consider?

16:10.504 --> 16:13.339
Yes.
Could I have their names?

16:14.240 --> 16:17.110
The other suspects--
could you give us
their names, please?

16:17.143 --> 16:19.379
Your client was the only one
we focused on

16:19.412 --> 16:21.047
as a viable suspect
once--

16:21.081 --> 16:23.684
No other suspects considered
besides Dennis Mills--

16:23.717 --> 16:25.519
would that be
your testimony, Detective?

16:25.552 --> 16:28.088
Well, we considered others,
but we concluded

16:28.121 --> 16:30.524
that your client
was the only viable suspect.

16:30.557 --> 16:33.026
I see.
Could I have the names

16:33.059 --> 16:34.528
of those other people
you considered?

16:34.561 --> 16:36.129
Objection-- badgering.

16:36.162 --> 16:39.165
Overruled.
Answer the question, Detective.

16:42.102 --> 16:43.570
The only person

16:43.604 --> 16:47.574
the department seriously
considered was your client.

16:47.608 --> 16:49.142
JIMMY: I see.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.645
What about Anthony Brickman,

16:51.678 --> 16:54.280
a man also in the chat room?

16:54.314 --> 16:57.117
Did you know
he also e-mailed the victim?

16:57.150 --> 17:00.253
Yes.
Do you have knowledge
in one of those e-mails

17:00.286 --> 17:02.789
he threatened to kill
Stacey Kingman?

17:02.823 --> 17:04.324
Well, that man
routinely threatens--

17:04.357 --> 17:05.659
It was a yes or no
question, Detective.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.828
Do you have knowledge
that Anthony Brickman

17:07.861 --> 17:11.832
e-mailed Stacey Kingman
threatening to kill her--

17:11.865 --> 17:14.334
Yes or no?
Yes.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.469
Did you tell District Attorney
Fox about Anthony Brickman?

17:16.502 --> 17:18.739
No.
You didn't?

17:18.771 --> 17:21.742
You've been
a detective, what, 21 years?

17:21.775 --> 17:22.843
Twenty-seven.

17:22.876 --> 17:23.810
Twenty-seven.

17:23.844 --> 17:27.380
As an experienced detective
of so many years,

17:27.413 --> 17:29.215
you knew if you turned
what you knew

17:29.249 --> 17:31.417
about Anthony Brickman
over to the DA,

17:31.451 --> 17:34.420
he would be obligated by law
to tell us about him.

17:34.454 --> 17:36.557
Is that why you didn't
tell the district attorney?

17:36.590 --> 17:38.358
No, it is not.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.260
The truth is, Detective,

17:40.293 --> 17:43.363
in your mind, you got
the right guy in Dennis Mills

17:43.396 --> 17:46.166
and you didn't bother
to investigate anybody else.

17:46.199 --> 17:48.301
Our investigation--
all of it--

17:48.334 --> 17:49.836
pointed to your client.

17:49.870 --> 17:53.607
But your investigation can't
rule out the possibility

17:53.640 --> 17:55.842
somebody framed Dennis Mills,

17:55.876 --> 17:57.544
can it, Detective?

17:57.578 --> 18:00.480
That body could have been
put in his car,

18:00.514 --> 18:03.884
the hammer could have been
placed in his garage,

18:03.917 --> 18:05.318
and the glasses
with his prints

18:05.351 --> 18:08.188
could have been planted
in the house.

18:08.221 --> 18:10.591
All of that is possible,
isn't it, Detective?

18:10.624 --> 18:13.293
Well, how did his prints
get on the glasses?
I don't know.

18:13.326 --> 18:14.661
Would have been nice
if you investigated it.

18:14.695 --> 18:16.663
Objection.
Sustained.

18:16.697 --> 18:18.765
You're a drinker,
aren't you, Detective Doaks?

18:18.799 --> 18:20.500
FOX: Objection.

18:20.534 --> 18:22.268
If this man's faculties
were compromised or impaired--

18:22.302 --> 18:24.137
Objection.
Sustained.

18:24.170 --> 18:25.906
My client's looking
at a death penalty

18:25.939 --> 18:28.509
based on the shoddy work
of a lazy drunk.

18:28.542 --> 18:30.343
Objection!
Sustained!

18:30.376 --> 18:32.412
That's enough,
Mr. Bezzuti.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.114
It's Berluti.

18:40.486 --> 18:43.489
I think I'm all done
with the detective.

18:58.539 --> 19:00.941
Research from Rebecca.
Just in time.
Anything good?

19:00.974 --> 19:03.844
California cases on point.
If we can keep
those letters out...

19:03.877 --> 19:06.179
You were so amazing.
What time's the motion?

19:06.212 --> 19:07.948
9:00 a.m.
You see the way
I had him trapped?

19:07.981 --> 19:09.716
He had nowhere to go.

19:09.750 --> 19:12.452
You were great.
Listen to you all.
You're on the moon

19:12.485 --> 19:14.254
about the prospect
of getting a man off

19:14.287 --> 19:15.789
who you don't even believe
is innocent.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.691
You don't know what
we believe, Mr. Kingman.

19:17.724 --> 19:19.425
Berluti! I'll be watching

19:19.459 --> 19:21.294
every step you take,
you son of a bitch!

19:21.327 --> 19:23.229
Yeah, you do that. Go tell
your drinking buddies...

19:23.263 --> 19:25.632
Leave it alone!
...you got your ass handed
to you by a fat fart.

19:27.968 --> 19:30.170
Come on, Jimmy.
We're back in.

19:35.842 --> 19:38.845
The idea
that my sister was wild

19:38.879 --> 19:41.281
or associating freely
with a bad element--

19:41.314 --> 19:43.216
that's simply not possible.

19:43.249 --> 19:44.885
But like Mr. Berluti said,

19:44.918 --> 19:46.853
she was in that erotic
chat room.

19:46.887 --> 19:50.524
I still can't believe that's
even possible, to be honest,

19:50.557 --> 19:52.826
but if she was,

19:52.859 --> 19:55.562
it was maybe
out of curiosity or boredom.

19:55.596 --> 19:57.698
She was not
a thrill-seeker,

19:57.731 --> 20:00.967
and would not be running
around keeping bad company.

20:01.001 --> 20:03.469
She went to the museum
to check my client out.

20:03.504 --> 20:04.605
That's what you say.

20:04.638 --> 20:06.306
I'll bet she mentioned
she was going

20:06.339 --> 20:07.741
and he went
to check her out.

20:07.774 --> 20:10.410
So I would gather
from your testimony, sister,

20:10.443 --> 20:12.579
that you would deem it
not just possible,

20:12.613 --> 20:15.549
even likely,
that Stacey and Dennis Mills

20:15.582 --> 20:17.884
never in fact
arranged to meet?

20:19.385 --> 20:21.354
Well...

20:21.387 --> 20:23.657
I can't believe
she would go off and meet up

20:23.690 --> 20:25.726
with some stranger
from the Internet.

20:26.693 --> 20:27.761
No, I can't.

20:29.062 --> 20:31.264
So far, it's going
better than expected.

20:31.297 --> 20:33.333
If we can keep the e-mail
letters from being admitted,

20:33.366 --> 20:34.668
then our strategy
will change.

20:34.701 --> 20:35.902
We won't be accusing
the husband.

20:35.936 --> 20:37.604
Okay. Why?

20:37.638 --> 20:39.940
Because pointing the finger
at the widower is very risky.

20:39.973 --> 20:41.875
We could completely
alienate the jury,

20:41.908 --> 20:44.745
and without that e-mail,
the prosecution's case
isn't that great.

20:44.778 --> 20:46.346
We'd have no reason
to take such a risk.

20:46.379 --> 20:49.382
So what you're telling
me now-- we have a chance.

20:49.415 --> 20:50.984
Long way to go,

20:51.017 --> 20:52.886
but we are definitely
in the fight.

20:55.021 --> 20:58.058
Okay, Karen, back to you.

20:58.091 --> 21:00.627
Can I put you on the stand?
Yes.

21:00.661 --> 21:03.429
After they rest, we'll call
one witness before you,

21:03.463 --> 21:04.865
and then you're on.

21:04.898 --> 21:06.800
Your rage flashes I've had
the privilege of witnessing?

21:06.833 --> 21:08.902
None of that on the stand.

21:08.935 --> 21:09.936
Okay.

21:11.505 --> 21:13.373
Okay, I've got
to get back to work.

21:13.406 --> 21:17.043
Lindsay, I don't know
how to thank you.

21:17.077 --> 21:19.312
Thank me when you walk
out of this courthouse.

21:26.753 --> 21:29.455
It's evidence
of his character,
it's prejudicial.

21:29.489 --> 21:30.791
The content
of these e-mails

21:30.824 --> 21:33.093
is directly probative
to Dennis Mills's guilt.

21:33.126 --> 21:34.961
There are some
that go to sexual sadism.

21:34.995 --> 21:37.030
They do not go to the issue
of guilt or innocence.

21:37.063 --> 21:38.932
They certainly go
to a predisposition.

21:38.965 --> 21:40.801
That isn't admissible.

21:40.834 --> 21:42.869
It's evidence which is being
offered to show

21:42.903 --> 21:44.538
that the defendant
is more likely

21:44.571 --> 21:46.406
to have committed
the alleged crime.

21:46.439 --> 21:47.974
That is flat-out inadmissible

21:48.008 --> 21:49.409
under the California Code
of Evidence.

21:49.442 --> 21:50.911
You have the case law.

21:50.944 --> 21:52.679
It seems to me
the letters do more

21:52.713 --> 21:54.347
than suggest
bad character.

21:54.380 --> 21:55.649
That's the main thing
they do, and--

21:55.682 --> 21:56.983
[INHALES]

21:58.552 --> 22:00.987
I-I'm sorry, Your Honor.
You were saying?

22:03.389 --> 22:06.092
They are relevant
to much more than character.

22:06.126 --> 22:07.828
They go to state of mind,

22:07.861 --> 22:09.963
which to me goes to motive.

22:09.996 --> 22:12.132
Mr. Fox, I'll give you
five e-mails.

22:12.165 --> 22:14.367
Pick which ones
you want to enter,

22:14.400 --> 22:15.702
but I won't let you load up,

22:15.736 --> 22:17.704
trying to bury the defendant
with volume.

22:17.738 --> 22:19.405
With all due respect,
Your Honor,

22:19.439 --> 22:21.542
if one of them is admissible,
they all should be.

22:21.575 --> 22:23.577
Then maybe I should
exclude them all.

22:23.610 --> 22:24.978
Five is fine.

22:25.011 --> 22:28.414
I must reiterate,
these e-mails do not speak

22:28.448 --> 22:30.551
to whether my client
committed the crime.

22:30.584 --> 22:31.818
Then why are you
so bothered if they--

22:31.852 --> 22:32.853
'Cause they--

22:34.020 --> 22:37.357
I thought you were finished.
I really did.

22:39.926 --> 22:41.728
I am bothered

22:41.762 --> 22:44.464
because the graphic nature
of some of these e-mails

22:44.497 --> 22:47.433
may cause the jury to believe
that Dennis Mills is deviant

22:47.467 --> 22:49.803
and therefore more likely
to have committed murder.

22:49.836 --> 22:52.773
That's exactly why
these evidentiary rules exist--

22:52.806 --> 22:55.108
to prevent this kind
of prejudicial influence.

22:55.141 --> 22:57.944
Well, I happen to believe
the letters do have
probative value.

22:57.978 --> 23:00.614
They're bound up with motive
and therefore admissible.

23:00.647 --> 23:01.982
To prevent prejudice,

23:02.015 --> 23:04.050
I am limiting
the prosecution to five.

23:04.084 --> 23:07.020
We are adjourned,
and now I am finished.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.690
Five minutes.
We'll bring the jury in.

23:11.091 --> 23:13.059
Five is better than 60.

23:13.093 --> 23:15.629
At least they can't be reading
that stuff for three days.

23:15.662 --> 23:17.030
It should have all
been excluded.

23:17.063 --> 23:18.599
He's calling Kingman
to read them.

23:18.632 --> 23:19.633
What?

23:19.666 --> 23:20.701
Kingman found 'em.

23:20.734 --> 23:21.902
Chain of custody.

23:21.935 --> 23:24.505
Great.
Should we plan "B" him now?

23:24.538 --> 23:26.673
Not on the heels
of reading those letters.

23:26.707 --> 23:28.575
We'll recall him later
and then--

23:28.609 --> 23:30.777
What is this?
You subpoena me?

23:30.811 --> 23:33.079
Are you putting me up there
to say I whacked that lady?

23:33.113 --> 23:34.848
That's not why
I'm calling you, Anthony.

23:34.881 --> 23:37.050
I'm putting you up
as a hacker expert.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.085
An expert?

23:39.119 --> 23:41.154
I want you to testify
how you intercept e-mail.

23:41.187 --> 23:42.055
That's all.

23:42.088 --> 23:45.025
How do I know you won't,
like, plan "B" me?

23:45.058 --> 23:47.628
That's the thing
about the net, Mr. Donnell.

23:47.661 --> 23:49.596
Local news is national news.

23:49.630 --> 23:52.032
I got on-line, pulled up
some articles on you guys.

23:52.065 --> 23:54.935
Client cuts off a head.
The big lady here dates him,

23:54.968 --> 23:57.470
you plan "B"
the headless girl's brother.

23:57.504 --> 23:59.540
Got sued for it.

23:59.573 --> 24:01.742
I don't intend
to plan "B" you, Anthony.

24:01.775 --> 24:04.611
I just want
your computer expertise.

24:09.950 --> 24:12.886
"Today I dreamed we were angry.

24:12.919 --> 24:15.255
I was driving myself into you,

24:15.288 --> 24:18.191
and it hurt you.

24:18.224 --> 24:19.960
But pain became pleasure,

24:19.993 --> 24:22.128
and I kept pushing and pushing

24:22.162 --> 24:25.566
until you appeared lifeless.

24:25.599 --> 24:28.569
And I continued
to make love to you.

24:28.602 --> 24:31.772
You lie there still--
cold even.

24:31.805 --> 24:35.008
And I continue to push myself
deep inside you.

24:37.944 --> 24:40.480
I tear your skin away.

24:41.281 --> 24:42.849
It's not enough to be together.

24:44.150 --> 24:48.655
I want to be in you,
and I rip the skin,

24:48.689 --> 24:52.292
and I feel your warm blood
on my skin.

24:52.325 --> 24:54.928
It brings me a toy..."

24:55.962 --> 24:57.130
Excuse me.

24:58.298 --> 25:00.934
"It brings me joy."

25:11.344 --> 25:14.615
For whatever reason,
hearing them read out loud...

25:15.982 --> 25:18.852
Well, at least
he only put in three.

25:18.885 --> 25:20.286
He's saving two.

25:20.320 --> 25:21.722
For what?

25:21.755 --> 25:23.023
For you.

25:23.056 --> 25:24.891
However well you do
in your testimony,

25:24.925 --> 25:26.627
Fox will have you
read them on cross

25:26.660 --> 25:28.995
so it'll be your last
impression with the jury.

25:33.734 --> 25:35.268
You okay?

25:38.004 --> 25:39.873
I, uh, hadn't read them all.

25:40.941 --> 25:42.042
I didn't, um...

25:44.678 --> 25:46.279
I hadn't read
the ones I just heard.

25:49.916 --> 25:51.752
I know you all must think
I'm sick.

25:51.785 --> 25:53.787
Can I explain?

25:53.820 --> 25:55.756
Oh, you're going
to have to explain, Dennis...

25:55.789 --> 25:57.591
To 12 people in a box.

26:00.961 --> 26:04.798
First, let's just
get through Brickman.

26:04.831 --> 26:06.933
There's no such thing
as privacy on the net,

26:06.967 --> 26:08.969
you may think you're sending
a private e-mail,

26:09.002 --> 26:11.071
but even a kiddie hacker
could gain access.

26:11.104 --> 26:13.273
So, say if Mr. Mills
were sending an e-mail

26:13.306 --> 26:16.109
to Stacey Kingman
and only Stacey Kingman,

26:16.142 --> 26:17.844
it's possible
that somebody else

26:17.878 --> 26:19.913
could access it, read it...

26:19.946 --> 26:23.283
Objection. This witness
has no foundation to give
expert testimony.

26:23.316 --> 26:26.953
I specifically called him
because he is a typical
layperson computer hacker

26:26.987 --> 26:28.922
for the purpose of showing
how easy it is

26:28.955 --> 26:30.657
to intercept e-mail.

26:30.691 --> 26:32.693
The objection is overruled.

26:32.726 --> 26:36.630
Mr. Brickman,
the e-mails my client
sent to Mrs. Kingman--

26:36.663 --> 26:38.098
did you ever see them?

26:38.131 --> 26:40.634
Yes. I was in
the same chat room,

26:40.667 --> 26:41.868
and I was typically riveted

26:41.902 --> 26:43.637
by your client's
contributions.

26:43.670 --> 26:46.106
I hacked
into his e-mail a lot.

26:46.139 --> 26:47.741
It's publishable. Ask me.

26:47.774 --> 26:50.210
BOBBY: You accessed
his e-mail a lot?

26:50.243 --> 26:53.379
The man can write.
It's very arousing.

26:53.413 --> 26:55.115
Thank you.

26:55.148 --> 26:56.883
Oh, one other thing--

26:56.917 --> 26:59.352
You threatened to kill
Stacey Kingman, didn't you?

26:59.385 --> 27:01.087
You said you weren't
going to get into that.

27:01.121 --> 27:03.690
I don't mean to attack you,
but the police did question you

27:03.724 --> 27:05.792
with respect to this threat,
didn't they?

27:05.826 --> 27:08.795
I threaten to kill
lots of women

27:08.829 --> 27:10.731
by way of introduction.

27:10.764 --> 27:12.799
You'd be surprised
how many write back.

27:12.833 --> 27:17.237
Did the police question you?
Yes. I had an alibi.

27:17.270 --> 27:18.905
I was at a naked nude bar
with three buddies.

27:18.939 --> 27:20.306
I told this
to Detective Doaks.

27:20.340 --> 27:22.008
BOBBY: And he
accepted your word?

27:22.042 --> 27:24.878
Truth be told,
I think he was there, too.

27:24.911 --> 27:27.313
(laughter)

27:27.347 --> 27:30.784
Mr. Brickman, this is not
a forum for you to entertain.

27:32.853 --> 27:34.287
Is there anything else,
counsel?

27:34.320 --> 27:35.321
No, Your Honor.

27:37.023 --> 27:38.291
Nothing.

27:38.324 --> 27:40.193
Defense calls Dennis Mills.

27:41.494 --> 27:45.031
DENNIS: It was an anonymous
form of expression.

27:45.065 --> 27:46.967
I was told once--

27:47.000 --> 27:49.736
a diary, uh,
when people write in them,

27:49.770 --> 27:52.739
they want it read
on some unconscious level.

27:52.773 --> 27:54.775
And when you would write
these e-mails...

27:54.808 --> 27:58.078
DENNIS: It was, uh,
I guess more thrilling

27:58.111 --> 27:59.846
to know it was being read
by somebody.

27:59.880 --> 28:01.314
BOBBY (sighing): Okay.

28:01.347 --> 28:04.450
But, Dennis,
some of the stuff you wrote...

28:04.484 --> 28:08.354
Very dark.
I will own that.

28:08.388 --> 28:10.891
Many people like
pornography,

28:10.924 --> 28:13.994
and some get more aroused
when it's dangerous--

28:14.027 --> 28:15.395
even violent.

28:15.428 --> 28:18.398
I don't deny
being put in that category.

28:18.431 --> 28:20.867
But the e-mails,
the chat room--

28:20.901 --> 28:25.338
it was kind of an interactive
pornographic thing,

28:25.371 --> 28:28.509
but I have never, ever
acted out on--

28:28.542 --> 28:31.311
I never even met
Stacey Kingman,

28:31.344 --> 28:33.346
and I certainly
didn't kill her.

28:33.379 --> 28:36.983
But you do admit
these writings of yours...

28:37.017 --> 28:40.020
But that's all it was,
Mr. Donnell-- writing.

28:40.053 --> 28:41.522
BOBBY: Fine, but a dead body

28:41.555 --> 28:45.091
of someone you talked
about being lifeless

28:45.125 --> 28:46.459
ended up in your trunk.

28:46.492 --> 28:50.531
I'm telling you that
somebody else put her there.

28:50.564 --> 28:53.199
Somebody is trying
to set me up

28:53.233 --> 28:56.402
to take a fall
for a crime I didn't commit.

28:58.238 --> 28:59.439
You claim
you were home alone

28:59.472 --> 29:01.174
the evening that
Mrs. Kingman was murdered.

29:01.207 --> 29:04.110
Yes.
Never heard anybody
break into your garage,

29:04.144 --> 29:06.880
break into your car,
dump off a dead body?
No.

29:06.913 --> 29:10.116
Any sign of a break-in, either
with your car or the garage?

29:10.150 --> 29:13.419
They were both unlocked.
The car trunk was unlocked?

29:14.487 --> 29:16.122
No.

29:18.925 --> 29:21.194
Could you read this e-mail
for the court, please?

29:22.529 --> 29:24.197
(clears throat)

29:24.230 --> 29:26.299
"Tonight I see you..."

29:29.335 --> 29:31.137
I didn't write this.

29:31.171 --> 29:32.472
Mr. Mills, you've already
admitted to writing it.

29:32.506 --> 29:34.941
I didn't write this one.
Would you read it, please?

29:34.975 --> 29:36.977
No, I didn't write it!
Your Honor.

29:37.010 --> 29:39.479
I never saw this one.
I didn't write it.
What's going on?

29:39.513 --> 29:42.082
This is in the packet already
stipulated to by the defense

29:42.115 --> 29:43.550
as being written
by the defendant.

29:43.584 --> 29:45.185
I never saw this one.
I didn't write it.

29:45.218 --> 29:46.419
Sidebar.

29:52.358 --> 29:54.227
Chain of custody
has been stipulated to.

29:54.260 --> 29:55.596
It was in the victim's desk.

29:55.629 --> 29:57.397
My client didn't review
all the e-mails,

29:57.430 --> 29:59.600
and his former attorney who
agreed to the stipulation--

29:59.633 --> 30:01.134
I'd be surprised
if he read any.

30:02.135 --> 30:03.403
I'll allow it.

30:03.436 --> 30:04.505
Your Honor,
he shouldn't have--

30:04.538 --> 30:07.508
You're free to argue he didn't
write it, Mr. Donnell.

30:07.541 --> 30:08.875
Step back.

30:11.444 --> 30:13.046
(exhales)

30:15.248 --> 30:18.384
The jury is advised,
despite the defense stipulation,

30:18.418 --> 30:21.622
that Mr. Mills
denies authorship.

30:21.655 --> 30:23.189
We're covered.

30:23.223 --> 30:24.525
Appealed.

30:24.558 --> 30:26.560
So noted. Take your seat.

30:36.603 --> 30:38.104
"Tonight I--

30:41.274 --> 30:43.109
I see you beneath me.

30:44.444 --> 30:46.246
Your eyes are vacant.

30:46.279 --> 30:48.081
I see your face in death,

30:48.114 --> 30:51.017
and I see my hands--

30:51.618 --> 30:53.219
the hands that took you,

30:53.253 --> 30:56.523
the hands that
delivered you to God."

31:00.326 --> 31:01.962
I never wrote that.

31:03.396 --> 31:05.165
I never wrote that.

31:15.041 --> 31:16.510
BOBBY: I don't see
any other option.

31:17.644 --> 31:19.680
We gotta go back
to the husband and plan "B."

31:19.713 --> 31:22.448
At this point,
it will look so desperate.

31:22.482 --> 31:24.050
I mean,
all we'll accomplish--

31:24.084 --> 31:26.186
The jury will want to
convict us along with Dennis.

31:26.219 --> 31:28.689
Well, Lindsay, any ideas?
We're all listening.

31:28.722 --> 31:30.190
He didn't write that e-mail,

31:30.223 --> 31:32.192
and I thought he denied it
pretty persuasively,

31:32.225 --> 31:33.326
didn't you, Lucy?

31:33.359 --> 31:35.261
(scoffs)
Go to the beach!

31:50.511 --> 31:53.179
We've done everything
we can, Lindsay.

31:54.280 --> 31:55.481
I know.

31:57.417 --> 32:00.453
I think I always believed

32:00.486 --> 32:02.155
if you had
an innocent client

32:02.188 --> 32:06.426
and you fought your hardest,
you'd win.

32:11.364 --> 32:12.699
That's how it should work.

32:15.569 --> 32:17.337
Let me take a shot
at the husband.

32:21.542 --> 32:23.043
Do you think
it will work?

32:27.514 --> 32:28.582
No.

32:30.250 --> 32:32.318
This case
is still circumstantial,

32:32.352 --> 32:35.288
but the impact
of those letters was...

32:36.690 --> 32:38.324
...very damaging.

32:42.495 --> 32:45.465
Our plan is to put you,
Karen, up first.

32:45.498 --> 32:46.600
Then we'll call Kingman

32:46.633 --> 32:48.735
and ambush him
as best we can.

32:48.769 --> 32:51.071
He has an alibi,
I thought.

32:51.104 --> 32:52.739
He does,
but we'll try to suggest

32:52.773 --> 32:54.107
he hired somebody
to kill her,

32:54.140 --> 32:57.210
which, personally,
I think he did.

32:57.243 --> 32:58.545
I think he's the guy.

32:59.379 --> 33:01.014
But we have no proof.

33:02.115 --> 33:03.216
No.

33:05.786 --> 33:08.354
Then we'll recall you,
Dennis,

33:08.388 --> 33:10.256
and try to make your last
impression with the jury

33:10.290 --> 33:11.558
something other than...

33:15.796 --> 33:17.263
Then we'll rest.

33:18.231 --> 33:20.100
And hope for the best.

33:27.674 --> 33:30.010
Anything can happen.

33:31.678 --> 33:33.313
Their case
is circumstantial.

33:34.815 --> 33:38.384
There must be something
you can do, Ms. Dole.

33:39.485 --> 33:41.254
Can't you think
of anything?

33:41.287 --> 33:43.524
(Dennis crying)

33:53.433 --> 33:55.235
I want you watching the faces
of the jurors.

33:55.268 --> 33:56.703
If it looks like I'm tanking,
let me know.

33:56.737 --> 33:58.338
I'll cut my losses.

33:58.371 --> 34:00.373
When you spoke to the husband,
did he seem sympathetic?

34:00.406 --> 34:02.075
Very.
Great.

34:02.108 --> 34:03.443
Ready?

34:03.476 --> 34:04.611
No. Does it matter?

34:04.645 --> 34:06.780
You don't look so cocky
today, Jimbo.

34:06.813 --> 34:08.614
Hey, we can always
call you again.

34:10.250 --> 34:11.518
Let's go.

34:13.853 --> 34:16.289
It is inconceivable
that my husband

34:16.322 --> 34:17.791
could have committed
this crime.

34:17.824 --> 34:19.760
You feel pretty sure
about that?

34:19.793 --> 34:22.529
I have known him
for 12 years.

34:22.563 --> 34:25.732
I have never known him
to have any capacity
for violence.

34:25.766 --> 34:28.301
He is a gentle person.

34:28.333 --> 34:31.304
You read the things
he wrote to Stacey Kingman

34:31.337 --> 34:33.873
about wanting
to make love to her.

34:33.907 --> 34:35.509
Did you know
your husband

34:35.542 --> 34:38.078
was writing those things
to another woman?

34:39.212 --> 34:40.647
No.

34:40.681 --> 34:42.849
He kept the relationship
secret from you?

34:42.882 --> 34:44.449
Yes, but--

34:44.484 --> 34:47.588
So you can't really
sit in that chair

34:47.621 --> 34:50.690
and lay claim to knowing
everything about him, can you?

34:50.724 --> 34:53.126
I know
he's not a murderer.

34:53.159 --> 34:56.797
Well, at the time the police
first questioned you,

34:56.830 --> 34:59.365
you weren't even sure
about that, though, were you?

34:59.399 --> 35:01.668
I was in shock when I
first spoke to the police.

35:01.702 --> 35:05.105
At that point,
you weren't sure, were you?

35:06.272 --> 35:08.775
Did you know your husband
to be capable

35:08.809 --> 35:11.578
of writing the things he wrote
in these e-mails, Mrs. Mills?

35:11.612 --> 35:13.479
When first confronted
with those e-mails,

35:13.514 --> 35:16.349
did you not say,
"that is not my husband"?

35:16.382 --> 35:18.451
Didn't you say that,
Mrs. Mills?

35:23.189 --> 35:24.324
Yes.

35:24.357 --> 35:27.628
And here you sit,
saying you know him.

35:29.530 --> 35:31.431
Could you read this
for the court, please?

35:31.464 --> 35:33.834
I shouldn't have to--
Your Honor.

35:33.867 --> 35:35.702
Please read it,
Mrs. Mills.

35:49.249 --> 35:51.652
"I find myself thinking
of you more and more.

35:51.685 --> 35:54.454
I feel it's becoming
an obsession.

35:56.289 --> 35:58.258
An obsession
I must extinguish.

35:59.660 --> 36:02.228
It's time for it all
to be extinguished."

36:05.498 --> 36:06.733
FOX: Thank you, Mrs. Mills.

36:06.767 --> 36:08.401
That's all I have.

36:12.673 --> 36:14.474
Ms. Dole, redirect?

36:17.010 --> 36:18.545
Ms. Dole?

36:26.553 --> 36:27.721
It's you.

36:28.589 --> 36:30.356
Excuse me?

36:30.390 --> 36:32.425
May I see
your glasses, please?

36:47.608 --> 36:50.343
That's how Dennis's prints
got on the victim's glasses.

36:52.478 --> 36:54.247
That's why
he doesn't remember.

36:55.882 --> 36:57.751
What are you
talking about?

36:57.784 --> 37:01.354
One night you probably said,
"Honey, hand me my glasses,"

37:01.387 --> 37:03.356
which he did.

37:03.389 --> 37:06.993
When he was really picking up
Stacey Kingman's glasses.

37:07.027 --> 37:09.563
What the hell is this?
Latitude, Your Honor.

37:09.596 --> 37:11.998
The woman Zachary Kingman
was having the affair with--

37:12.032 --> 37:15.001
maybe is having
an affair with-- is you.

37:15.035 --> 37:16.603
Have you lost your mind?

37:16.637 --> 37:18.438
Stacey's sister
couldn't imagine Stacey

37:18.471 --> 37:20.974
getting involved
with an e-mail relationship.

37:21.007 --> 37:23.376
She never did,
did she, Karen?

37:24.077 --> 37:26.279
It was Zachary Kingman

37:26.312 --> 37:28.414
exchanging those e-mails
with your husband,

37:28.448 --> 37:30.450
pretending to be Stacey.

37:30.483 --> 37:31.952
(crowd murmuring)
Th-this is ridiculous.

37:31.985 --> 37:34.287
You discovered
your husband's predilection

37:34.320 --> 37:38.391
for chat room erotica
and decided to use it,
didn't you, Karen?

37:38.424 --> 37:40.426
Zachary Kingman
got in that same chat room

37:40.460 --> 37:41.862
pretending to be Stacey

37:41.895 --> 37:44.731
for the purpose of setting up
this perfect murder,

37:44.765 --> 37:47.500
which gets rid
of both your spouses.
Objection!

37:47.534 --> 37:50.571
That's crazy!
Is she going to ask the witness
a question or spin wild stories?

37:50.604 --> 37:52.005
LINDSAY: Here's my question,
Mrs. Mills,

37:52.038 --> 37:54.074
and I remind you
you're under oath.

37:54.107 --> 37:55.842
Are you now
or did you ever

37:55.876 --> 37:57.811
have an affair
with Zachary Kingman?

38:00.413 --> 38:02.082
I asked you a question,
Mrs. Mills.

38:02.115 --> 38:03.750
Are you now
or did you ever

38:03.784 --> 38:06.587
have an affair
with Zachary Kingman?

38:08.755 --> 38:10.724
Answer the question, Mrs. Mills.

38:15.996 --> 38:17.864
I refuse to answer the question

38:17.898 --> 38:19.766
on the grounds
that it may incriminate me.

38:19.800 --> 38:21.001
This is preposterous!

38:21.034 --> 38:22.569
Mr. Kingman,
take your seat.

38:22.603 --> 38:25.872
You and Zachary Kingman
conspired to kill his wife

38:25.906 --> 38:27.808
and frame your husband,
didn't you?

38:27.841 --> 38:30.511
I refuse to answer on the
grounds it may incriminate me.

38:30.544 --> 38:32.478
Your Honor, I'd ask that you
grant this woman immunity

38:32.513 --> 38:34.447
and compel her
to answer my question.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.850
The court is not about
to grant her immunity, counsel.

38:36.883 --> 38:38.952
She can refuse to answer
unless you grant immunity.

38:38.985 --> 38:40.453
My client's life is--

38:40.486 --> 38:41.755
I am not
granting immunity.

38:43.724 --> 38:45.726
This is your husband, Karen.

38:45.759 --> 38:47.861
Are you really gonna
let him take the fall?

38:49.763 --> 38:53.900
You and Zachary Kingman
did this together, didn't you?

38:55.669 --> 38:57.938
I am pleading
the Fifth Amendment.

39:02.475 --> 39:04.845
(crowd murmuring)

39:15.622 --> 39:16.823
Mr. Fox?

39:17.924 --> 39:19.560
Nothing, Your Honor.

39:19.593 --> 39:21.562
The witness may step down,

39:21.595 --> 39:25.498
but I am ordering you
not to leave this jurisdiction.

39:40.781 --> 39:42.949
JUDGE: Ms. Dole?
LINDSAY: The Defense
rests, Your Honor.

39:42.983 --> 39:45.485
Mr. Fox, rebuttal witnesses?

39:45.519 --> 39:47.120
No, Your Honor.

39:50.023 --> 39:51.391
All right.

39:55.028 --> 39:57.030
As a matter of law,

39:57.063 --> 39:59.866
I find that no jury
could reasonably deny

39:59.900 --> 40:02.435
the existence
of reasonable doubt here.

40:02.468 --> 40:04.871
I am directing a verdict
of not guilty.

40:04.905 --> 40:07.440
The defendant is free to go.
Adjourned!

40:07.473 --> 40:09.743
(crowd murmuring)
(gavel pounds)

40:09.776 --> 40:11.044
I can't believe it.

40:11.077 --> 40:12.513
Neither can I.

40:24.090 --> 40:25.626
It's over?

40:27.193 --> 40:28.662
It's over.

40:29.663 --> 40:30.931
It's over.

40:51.217 --> 40:52.819
(cell phone rings)

40:52.853 --> 40:54.788
Hang on,
I got a call coming in.

40:56.857 --> 40:58.091
What?

40:58.124 --> 40:59.726
You know, we didn't
have to take the redeye.

40:59.760 --> 41:01.161
One day at the beach
wouldn't have killed us.

41:01.194 --> 41:02.696
Would you
forget the beach?

41:02.729 --> 41:04.631
Well, that will be easy,
because I never saw it.

41:07.033 --> 41:08.134
She flipped him.

41:08.935 --> 41:09.970
What?

41:10.003 --> 41:11.938
Karen Mills
just confessed.

41:11.972 --> 41:13.507
Completely?
You got to be kidding.

41:13.540 --> 41:14.708
You pegged it.

41:14.741 --> 41:16.109
They were having an affair.

41:16.142 --> 41:18.912
Karen discovered
Dennis's chat room hobby.

41:18.945 --> 41:20.781
She and Kingman
decided to use it.

41:20.814 --> 41:22.248
Kingman killed his wife.

41:22.282 --> 41:24.217
Now Karen's looking
to plead out on conspiracy

41:24.250 --> 41:25.919
and flip Kingman.

41:25.952 --> 41:27.220
Unbelievable.

41:27.253 --> 41:28.689
How did it hit you?

41:28.722 --> 41:31.525
I don't know.
When I saw those glasses--

41:31.558 --> 41:33.093
I wish I could have
seen Doaks's face

41:33.126 --> 41:36.096
when she took the Fifth.
I forgot to look.

41:36.129 --> 41:38.865
Well, not that I want
to make our flight,
but we should go.

41:38.899 --> 41:40.567
Come on.

41:40.601 --> 41:41.902
Lindsay?

41:41.935 --> 41:43.236
Dennis?

41:44.170 --> 41:45.005
Did you hear?

41:45.038 --> 41:47.574
We just got off
with the DA's office.

41:47.608 --> 41:48.875
How are you doing?

41:48.909 --> 41:51.578
Well, I'm still
a little shocked.

41:51.612 --> 41:54.848
I'm minus a loving wife,
but I'm not in jail.

41:54.881 --> 41:56.082
Yeah.

41:57.317 --> 41:58.985
Listen, uh, can I
talk to you a second?

41:59.019 --> 42:01.054
Yeah, it's about
all I have.

42:01.087 --> 42:03.156
No, I just, um,
I wanted to--

42:04.758 --> 42:07.761
Uh, I know you're gonna
get back on the plane,

42:07.794 --> 42:09.763
and tomorrow there's
gonna be another client

42:09.796 --> 42:11.898
and another one after that
and another one after that,

42:11.932 --> 42:14.000
but for this client...

42:17.037 --> 42:20.707
Lindsay, when we
took that art class,

42:20.741 --> 42:22.142
I remember you saying

42:22.175 --> 42:24.277
how it was getting
tougher and tougher

42:24.310 --> 42:26.112
to wake up in the morning
and go to work

42:26.146 --> 42:28.849
believing in what you do.

42:28.882 --> 42:30.617
I'll never be able
to repay you people

42:30.651 --> 42:32.653
for giving me back my life.

42:32.686 --> 42:35.121
I don't even know how
to say thank you enough.

42:40.093 --> 42:42.596
But if I could
offer you this...

42:45.031 --> 42:49.135
Please, believe
in what you do.

42:49.169 --> 42:50.937
And believe
in what you are.

42:54.040 --> 42:56.977
You're all...
special people.

43:22.335 --> 43:24.004
We got to go.

44:01.074 --> 44:03.243
(music playing)

44:27.433 --> 44:28.434
You stinker!
