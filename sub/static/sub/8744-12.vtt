My deal Irons, can't you see?

39:48.953 --> 39:52.719
This is where the real battle is fought.

39:52.890 --> 39:54.984
And you have lost.

39:55.860 --> 39:56.918
Where are we?

39:57.795 --> 39:58.819
My domain.

39:59.463 --> 40:01.898
A place where there is no difference...

40:02.066 --> 40:05.468
...between warriors of the word
and warriors of the sword.

40:06.771 --> 40:09.103
Here. they are one and the same.

40:09.840 --> 40:11.774
And. here. you...

40:12.376 --> 40:17.075
...who are neither.
are not protected by anything.

40:33.798 --> 40:35.425
Why now?

40:35.599 --> 40:37.658
Why this time?

40:38.469 --> 40:40.460
Because I am no longer angry.

40:54.351 --> 40:57.844
Hey. Danny. check this out.

40:58.389 --> 41:01.086
Looks like CybelFaust shut his site down.

41:01.258 --> 41:03.590
The feds aren't gonna get squat.

41:05.062 --> 41:08.828
OI maybe someone shut it down 10! him.

41:49.106 --> 41:50.232

41:50.407 --> 41:52.102
Gabriel. hi.

41:53.143 --> 41:55.942
Oh. hi.

41:57.414 --> 41:58.506
Uh...

42:00.184 --> 42:04.382
Did what I think. um. just happened.
just happen?

42:05.389 --> 42:08.051
Depends on what you think happened.

42:09.860 --> 42:12.124
I think I don't feel so good.

42:12.296 --> 42:13.730
Yeah.

42:13.898 --> 42:15.957
There's been a virus going around.

42:16.133 --> 42:19.933
- You should probably get some lest.
- Yeah.

42:22.506 --> 42:24.873
- Uh. Sara?

42:25.042 --> 42:27.477

42:35.319 --> 42:37.219
