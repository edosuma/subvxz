Yeah, that's my wife.

03:48.176 --> 03:49.593
What do you want?

03:51.555 --> 03:54.555
That has nothing to do with me, bro.

I don't know who you are or what you want,

04:17.449 --> 04:19.569
but I'll never touch her again, I swear.

(engine revs)

05:13.541 --> 05:17.097
(telephone ringing)

05:17.097 --> 05:18.014
- Dispatch.

05:19.494 --> 05:20.828
Yo, Dispatch, what's up?

05:20.828 --> 05:21.770
- [Dispatch] Officer Parkinson.

05:21.770 --> 05:23.955
You are the closest unit in the area.

05:23.955 --> 05:26.762
We need you to pursue a
black Honda motorcycle,

05:26.762 --> 05:29.253
with suspect wearing a brown jacket,

05:29.253 --> 05:31.508
black helmet and a black Pants

05:31.508 --> 05:33.727
for a possible assault and battery.

05:33.727 --> 05:35.173
- You couldn't get somebody else on this?

05:35.173 --> 05:38.083
- [Dispatch] Again, you are
the closest unit in the area

05:38.083 --> 05:39.635
and we need you to proceed.

05:39.635 --> 05:40.669
All right, I'm on it.

05:40.669 --> 05:45.669
(rhythmic music)
(engine revving)

05:46.085 --> 05:48.080
Dispatch, I'm in pursuit.

05:48.080 --> 05:50.141
I think you said, what's you
say he was wearing again?

05:50.141 --> 05:55.141
(engine revving)
(rhythmic music)

05:56.755 --> 05:58.990
Dang, She's fast.

05:58.990 --> 06:01.791
(rhythmic music)

06:01.791 --> 06:03.557
Come on car, move out the way.

06:03.557 --> 06:05.973
Officer coming through, come on now!

06:05.973 --> 06:08.723
(engine revving)

06:13.878 --> 06:16.197
This ain't none of my jurisdiction.

06:16.197 --> 06:18.153
Move out the way, thank you!

06:18.153 --> 06:20.178
(rhythmic music)

06:20.178 --> 06:22.928
(engine revving)

06:25.512 --> 06:28.012
Oh yeah, I found this sucker.

06:28.012 --> 06:31.036
I'm turning left on Washington
when I get a chance.

06:31.036 --> 06:33.786
(engine revving)

06:39.517 --> 06:41.620
Dispatch, suspect got away.

06:41.620 --> 06:44.644
I repeat, suspect got away.

06:44.644 --> 06:49.644
(engine revving)
(rhythmic music)

07:01.632 --> 07:03.142
- Girl.

07:03.142 --> 07:04.569
I'm the district attorney

07:04.569 --> 07:08.195
and I'm not even getting
that vaccine. (laughs)

07:08.195 --> 07:09.028
Right.

07:10.613 --> 07:11.987
Okay, let me give you a call back.

07:11.987 --> 07:14.320
I have a phone call to make.

07:22.709 --> 07:25.542
(phone vibrating)

07:27.105 --> 07:28.300
- Hello?

07:28.300 --> 07:29.826
- Detective Parkinson?

07:29.826 --> 07:32.451
This is district attorney Briona May.

07:32.451 --> 07:33.847
How are you?

07:33.847 --> 07:35.065
- I'm doing really well.

07:35.065 --> 07:37.493
Not every day I get to talk
to the district attorney.

07:37.493 --> 07:38.501
How can I help you?

07:38.501 --> 07:40.925
- It's a pleasure to have you on the line.

07:40.925 --> 07:42.426
I have something to discuss with you.

07:42.426 --> 07:45.828
(suspenseful music)

07:45.828 --> 07:47.130
- Cool.

07:47.130 --> 07:49.356
May I ask what this call is in regards to?

07:49.356 --> 07:50.249
- I want to acknowledge you

07:50.249 --> 07:52.792
for all the cases that you've closed.

07:52.792 --> 07:54.944
I and the City of Atlanta

07:54.944 --> 07:57.473
appreciate all of the
hard work you've done.

07:57.473 --> 07:59.333
- Thank you, ma'am.

07:59.333 --> 08:00.916
Is everything okay?

08:03.731 --> 08:05.633
- I'm throwing out the case.

08:05.633 --> 08:06.755
(man spits)

08:06.755 --> 08:07.931
- What?

08:07.931 --> 08:09.413
- Just hold on.

08:09.413 --> 08:11.409
I understand your concern,

08:11.409 --> 08:13.695
but this has been an ongoing investigation

08:13.695 --> 08:16.205
for almost two years now.

08:16.205 --> 08:17.583
- Ma'am, with all due respect,

08:17.583 --> 08:19.714
there has not been a case assigned to us

08:19.714 --> 08:21.581
that we have not been able to solve.

08:21.581 --> 08:24.166
I know now this case is
a missing persons case

08:24.166 --> 08:26.823
but we know who committed those murders.

08:26.823 --> 08:28.721
- Trust me, I get it.

08:28.721 --> 08:31.085
I respect the track record,

08:31.085 --> 08:34.719
but we can't continue to spend this money

08:34.719 --> 08:36.357
hunting down this woman.

08:36.357 --> 08:40.187
The only surviving witness won't testify.

08:40.187 --> 08:44.513
And the police report
dinged it as self defense.

08:44.513 --> 08:48.713
Look, in my eyes and from my perspective,

08:48.713 --> 08:51.653
Casey Stewart killed those people.

08:51.653 --> 08:56.198
So now I just think that it's
time for the city to move on.

08:56.198 --> 08:58.477
And so should you.

08:58.477 --> 09:03.161
(hand banging)
(ambient music)

09:03.161 --> 09:03.994
Hello?

09:06.311 --> 09:07.812
- How long?

09:07.812 --> 09:08.882
- How long, what?

09:08.882 --> 09:12.191
- How long do I have to close this case?

09:12.191 --> 09:13.734
- It's Monday the third.

09:13.734 --> 09:16.181
I'll be submitting
paperwork to close the case,

09:16.181 --> 09:18.217
the last Friday of the month.

09:18.217 --> 09:20.423
- Thank you, ma'am.

09:20.423 --> 09:21.734
That's all I need to hear.

09:21.734 --> 09:24.744
- And remember, for a case like this,

09:24.744 --> 09:28.011
your jurisdiction is nationwide.

09:28.011 --> 09:30.330
Good luck and have a blessed day.

09:30.330 --> 09:32.211
(tires screeching)

09:32.211 --> 09:34.961
(rhythmic music)

09:43.028 --> 09:45.265
- Hey, you.
- Hey, how you doing?

09:45.265 --> 09:46.098
How you doing?

09:46.098 --> 09:47.583
What's up, ah, hey.
- Hi.

09:47.583 --> 09:48.416
- Ruth, how's it going?

09:48.416 --> 09:49.249
- [Ruth] It's going good,
how you doing today?

09:49.249 --> 09:50.082
- [Tony] Good.

09:50.082 --> 09:52.832
(rhythmic music)

10:12.841 --> 10:14.785
- [Lady In Pink] Hey girl,
about to get started.

10:14.785 --> 10:15.618
- Okay.

10:15.618 --> 10:17.293
(rhythmic music)

10:17.293 --> 10:19.592
- All right ladies, now that
we're all here, we can begin.

10:19.592 --> 10:20.589
Who'd like to get us started?

10:20.589 --> 10:22.717
(rhythmic music)

10:22.717 --> 10:23.550
- I will.

10:24.661 --> 10:26.827
Ladies, I want to thank you guys again,

10:26.827 --> 10:29.019
for inviting me to this class.

10:29.019 --> 10:31.056
I know I've only been
here for a few sessions

10:31.056 --> 10:33.788
but it feels really good to chat and talk.

10:33.788 --> 10:36.725
You know, especially after
kicking butt for an hour.

10:36.725 --> 10:39.309
(ladies laughing)

10:39.309 --> 10:42.417
I knew joining this class
would really be a blessing.

10:42.417 --> 10:43.837
I feel like I'm in better shape

10:43.837 --> 10:46.136
and I can defend myself better.

10:46.136 --> 10:49.136
And honestly, Mitch has
been less aggressive.

10:49.136 --> 10:51.355
- Mitchell, your husband, right?

10:51.355 --> 10:52.814
- Yeah, Mitch.

10:52.814 --> 10:54.609
He's been a lot better lately.

10:54.609 --> 10:57.675
I don't know if it's my tone or demeanor.

10:57.675 --> 11:00.925
He's just been less angry and you know,

11:01.802 --> 11:03.837
I know it was an accident.

11:03.837 --> 11:06.158
I know he would never hurt me again.

11:06.158 --> 11:09.320
- That was his third accident, you know?

11:09.320 --> 11:11.557
- Well, that's why I
joined this class, Sarah.

11:11.557 --> 11:13.742
I mean, you guys all know that.

11:13.742 --> 11:15.904
Besides, Mitch called me today

11:15.904 --> 11:18.866
and told me that a burglar
broke in and assaulted him.

11:18.866 --> 11:20.325
- What?

11:20.325 --> 11:23.139
- Yeah, he called me and
said that some guy broke in

11:23.139 --> 11:24.514
wearing all black,

11:24.514 --> 11:26.250
beat him with a pipe.

11:26.250 --> 11:27.381
- Good, karma.

11:27.381 --> 11:29.049
(ladies laughing)

11:29.049 --> 11:31.983
(rhythmic music)

11:31.983 --> 11:35.257
(men faintly talking)

11:35.257 --> 11:38.507
(soft rhythmic music)

11:44.623 --> 11:48.956
(overlapping background chattering)

11:58.304 --> 11:59.144
- Please to meet ya.

11:59.144 --> 12:00.656
Let's not use names.

12:00.656 --> 12:01.799
- What you trying to look like?

12:01.799 --> 12:03.686
A secret agent or something?

12:03.686 --> 12:08.019
(overlapping background chattering)

12:12.084 --> 12:14.940
- Do you understand this
transaction is non-refundable?

12:14.940 --> 12:18.540
And we will not be responsible
if you do not make the deal?

12:18.540 --> 12:19.843
Do you understand, if you get caught,

12:19.843 --> 12:21.650
we'll deny ever meeting you.

12:21.650 --> 12:22.532
And do you-

12:22.532 --> 12:26.365
- Just count the money
and start your process.

12:31.101 --> 12:34.101
(suspenseful music)

12:38.230 --> 12:39.063
Count it.

12:40.089 --> 12:41.503
- You're good to go.

12:41.503 --> 12:44.617
- How am I supposed to receive the funds?

12:44.617 --> 12:46.706
(key drops)

12:46.706 --> 12:50.505

12:56.452 --> 12:58.476
- [Detective Parkinson] Atlanta, P.D.

12:58.476 --> 13:00.713
- I'm just the A++
certification guy around here.

13:00.713 --> 13:02.238
I got my Cisco certification,

13:02.238 --> 13:05.147
my Cisco certification, A++,

13:05.147 --> 13:07.043
I know Unreal Engine.

13:07.043 --> 13:08.221
- Calm down, sir.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.935
I got a warrant from the
DA to check the database.

13:09.935 --> 13:13.902
I need to go back two years
to the date of August 18th.

13:13.902 --> 13:15.498
- I don't know if our
database goes back far.

13:15.498 --> 13:16.991
The company got bought two years ago.

13:16.991 --> 13:18.503
- I'm looking for a woman.

13:18.503 --> 13:19.753
Let's find out.

13:20.611 --> 13:22.694
- All right, I can check.

13:26.626 --> 13:29.502
- There's no sign of her
anywhere on the West coast

13:29.502 --> 13:33.758
but she took a one-way ticket
to the Grand Canyon state.

13:33.758 --> 13:37.258
So the only question is who's helping her.

14:29.309 --> 14:30.525
- Why is no one working?

14:30.525 --> 14:32.322
- Ma'am, we've got a conundrum.

14:32.322 --> 14:34.220
- [Supervisor] David,
what is she talking about?

14:34.220 --> 14:38.717
- Well, ma'am I was processing
for a client, Isaac.

14:38.717 --> 14:41.237
- What are you talking about?

14:41.237 --> 14:43.816
His parent recipient information

Run it.

14:57.080 --> 14:58.225
- I'm sorry.

14:58.225 --> 14:59.841
- Run it, our job is processing.

14:59.841 --> 15:00.674
Just run it.

16:12.757 --> 16:14.788

16:14.788 --> 16:17.037
- Man, a motorcycle chase yesterday.

16:17.037 --> 16:19.305
You didn't call for back up or nothing.

16:19.305 --> 16:24.284
- Jaiye, you are a motor
vehicle fraud investigator.

16:24.284 --> 16:25.921
You're not back-up, bro.

16:25.921 --> 16:28.555
- Well look, somebody gave me
a gun, a badge and all that.

16:28.555 --> 16:30.687
I'm top of the top flight.

16:30.687 --> 16:32.672
All I need is a wife.

16:32.672 --> 16:34.448
- You're too young for a wife.

16:34.448 --> 16:35.655
- I'm 27.

16:35.655 --> 16:37.651
I already done had my ho' phase.

16:37.651 --> 16:39.435
I even talked to my pastor about it, man.

16:39.435 --> 16:40.268

16:42.573 --> 16:44.360
- You're not ready, okay, bro.

16:44.360 --> 16:46.860
You're just lonely, trust me.

16:46.860 --> 16:49.002
Marriage is not what they make it seem.

16:49.002 --> 16:51.258
It's just another title a woman changes

16:51.258 --> 16:53.008
after the baby comes.

16:55.475 --> 16:57.660
- Man, you just still
hurt from the divorce.

16:57.660 --> 17:01.000
What you need to do is come
to the peer group at church.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.250
Plus, a lot of single moms.

17:04.677 --> 17:07.124
- If I believed in best friends,

17:07.124 --> 17:09.411
brother, it would be you.

17:09.411 --> 17:11.411
- I am your best friend!

17:15.493 --> 17:18.338
- Look man, you've got a great career.

17:18.338 --> 17:20.163
Just focus on that.

17:20.163 --> 17:22.160
Besides, I'm seeing someone.

17:22.160 --> 17:24.627
And that love that, it's a construct,

17:24.627 --> 17:26.276
it's not even real.

17:26.276 --> 17:29.499
- What about man's greatest
desire, to provide and protect?

17:29.499 --> 17:32.985
- Buy a community center and get a dog.

17:32.985 --> 17:35.432
- So explain the feeling you get

17:35.432 --> 17:37.883
when they say you found the one.

17:37.883 --> 17:39.050
- A construct.

17:40.446 --> 17:42.434
- What about the hanky panky?

17:42.434 --> 17:46.783
You know the street's got an
expiration date for everybody.

17:46.783 --> 17:49.763
- Look Jaiye, I'm not anti-marriage.

17:49.763 --> 17:52.680
I just don't believe in it anymore.

17:53.882 --> 17:55.405
- One woman.

17:55.405 --> 17:57.661
One woman leaves a great guy

17:57.661 --> 17:59.037
for a rent-a-cop wanna-be

17:59.037 --> 18:02.083
and now we lose good
brothers to the streets?

18:02.083 --> 18:04.166
I'm shaking my head, man.

18:06.924 --> 18:10.209
(Zachariah sighs)

18:10.209 --> 18:11.984
- I don't know what wrong yesterday.

18:11.984 --> 18:14.263
But I could have lost a
perfectly good officer

18:14.263 --> 18:15.878
on a reckless police chase

18:15.878 --> 18:18.379
on a simple assault battery.

18:18.379 --> 18:20.605
- Sir, let me explain.

18:20.605 --> 18:22.881
- What you did was completely reckless

18:22.881 --> 18:24.825
and out of police policy.

18:24.825 --> 18:25.658
- What would you have me to do?

18:25.658 --> 18:26.575
Call Jaiye?

18:28.749 --> 18:31.514
- Yes, that's exactly
what I want you to do.

18:31.514 --> 18:33.510
He could have had the car impounded

18:33.510 --> 18:35.465
and then we issue an arrest warrant

18:35.465 --> 18:36.993
and just arrest them.

18:36.993 --> 18:39.790
- Come on, Captain Drew.

18:39.790 --> 18:41.784
- Settle down, settle down.

18:41.784 --> 18:42.784
Have a seat.

18:43.906 --> 18:47.566
We got a call from Atlanta, Metro PD.

18:47.566 --> 18:48.850
- So tell me,

18:48.850 --> 18:52.307
what does that got to do with me?

18:52.307 --> 18:55.474
- Zachariah, meet Detective Parkinson.

18:56.347 --> 18:58.097
- Yo, you a Jamaican.

18:59.318 --> 19:00.151
(pensive music)

19:00.151 --> 19:00.984
- How you know that?

19:00.984 --> 19:04.918
- (laughs) I read a lot.

19:04.918 --> 19:08.309
- (sighs) Detective Parkinson,

19:08.309 --> 19:10.481
won't you tell Zachariah why you're here?

19:10.481 --> 19:11.752
- Thank you, Captain.

19:11.752 --> 19:13.559
I'm here from Atlanta
to close a murder case.

19:13.559 --> 19:15.162
I have reason to believe that that suspect

19:15.162 --> 19:18.293
might be living here in the Phoenix area.

19:18.293 --> 19:19.755
- Look, Captain Drew,

19:19.755 --> 19:21.863
with all due respect, man, look,

19:21.863 --> 19:24.929
I just cannot commit any time
to that case right now, man.

19:24.929 --> 19:26.170
I'm devoting all my energy

19:26.170 --> 19:27.751
to the missing girl's case, all right.

19:27.751 --> 19:28.885
We might have a kidnapping ring

19:28.885 --> 19:31.302
with something worse in our home city.

19:31.302 --> 19:33.947
- We may very well have
a sex trafficking ring,

19:33.947 --> 19:38.021
but this comes from the top
and you're working with them.

19:38.021 --> 19:41.898
Besides, you already work
the database the best

19:41.898 --> 19:43.680
and you already got clearance.

19:43.680 --> 19:47.513
- Unless he's helping
me on my case, I'm good.

19:49.319 --> 19:50.736
- And since your divorce,

19:50.736 --> 19:53.194
you've been wanting to
work a little bit too much.

19:53.194 --> 19:55.546
So you can either work with him

19:55.546 --> 19:57.551
or you can just go on home.

19:57.551 --> 20:00.218
(pensive music)

20:01.205 --> 20:02.038
- All good, Captain.

20:02.038 --> 20:03.214
I'll be right back.

20:03.214 --> 20:05.997
(pensive music)

20:05.997 --> 20:07.823
(door shuts)

20:07.823 --> 20:12.823
(Zachariah murmuring)
(pensive music)

20:13.924 --> 20:14.985
This too shall pass.

20:14.985 --> 20:18.606
(Zachariah murmuring)

20:18.606 --> 20:21.273
(pensive music)

20:22.218 --> 20:23.427
Pleasure to meet you.

20:23.427 --> 20:25.156
Cap, I'll be at my desk.

20:25.156 --> 20:27.906
(pensive music)

20:30.965 --> 20:32.729
- Yo, Jaiye,

20:32.729 --> 20:33.562
bro, why you ain't tell me

20:33.562 --> 20:37.475
I'll be possibly working with the ATL PD?

20:37.475 --> 20:38.308
I don't know, man.

20:38.308 --> 20:39.141
Something about a cold case.

20:39.141 --> 20:42.546
You know, I ain't trying to do all that.

20:42.546 --> 20:45.046
Look, man, just meet me at
my desk at lunch, all right.

20:45.046 --> 20:47.463
One. (sighs)

20:49.299 --> 20:51.882
(upbeat music)

21:00.816 --> 21:01.961
(engine revving)

21:01.961 --> 21:03.831
- [Ruth] Yes, I know.

21:03.831 --> 21:06.421
I'm headed there right now.

21:06.421 --> 21:08.216
I don't know if I'm going to catch him.

21:08.216 --> 21:13.216
(engine revving)
(upbeat music)

21:34.222 --> 21:36.972
(light knocking)

21:38.784 --> 21:41.034
- You must be the drop off?

21:42.246 --> 21:44.829
You don't talk much, I take it.

21:46.069 --> 21:47.486
You should know the passcode.

21:47.486 --> 21:48.402
They don't give me the passcodes.

21:48.402 --> 21:51.300
They just give me the tablets.

21:51.300 --> 21:53.967
All right, well, I'mma take off.

21:54.839 --> 21:57.339
(car beeping)

22:02.808 --> 22:05.465
- What's the pass code?
- It's not important.

22:05.465 --> 22:08.246
- [Ruth] What is the passcode?

22:08.246 --> 22:10.367
Last time I checked, we're 50/50 partners

22:10.367 --> 22:12.896
and I can walk away from this at any time.

22:12.896 --> 22:14.646
What is the passcode?

22:17.328 --> 22:21.245
- [PJ] The passcode is
three, three, six, five.

22:23.698 --> 22:26.698
(suspenseful music)

22:31.964 --> 22:32.866
- What the hell are you doing?

22:32.866 --> 22:34.884
I could have killed you.

22:34.884 --> 22:37.552
- [Ruth] Who the hell do you work for?

22:37.552 --> 22:38.980
- You know, I can't tell you that.

22:38.980 --> 22:40.176
Just take the tablet and call me

22:40.176 --> 22:41.962
if you want to order any girls.

22:41.962 --> 22:43.212
- [Ruth] Order?

22:44.513 --> 22:45.437
- What the hell is your problem?

22:45.437 --> 22:47.316
I've got stops to make.

22:47.316 --> 22:49.732
(loud crushing)

22:49.732 --> 22:52.432
(man grunting)
- I don't want to hurt you.

22:52.432 --> 22:54.742
- Dang, too late.
- So, one more time.

22:54.742 --> 22:57.220
Who do you work for?

22:57.220 --> 23:00.117
- John, but everyone calls
him Tiberon. (grunting)

23:00.117 --> 23:03.117
(suspenseful music)

23:05.639 --> 23:07.456
- I'm gonna give you a cell phone.

23:07.456 --> 23:09.663
Call the last number that was dialed.

23:09.663 --> 23:12.897
If you call anyone else, I will find you.

23:12.897 --> 23:14.972
(suspenseful music)

23:14.972 --> 23:16.643
- [PJ] That was super reckless.

23:16.643 --> 23:18.399
- [Ruth] What are you talking about?

23:18.399 --> 23:19.522
- We got the tablets.

23:19.522 --> 23:20.612
We got the info.

23:20.612 --> 23:22.011
You still hurt the guy?

23:22.011 --> 23:23.668
- [Ruth] You wouldn't understand PJ.

23:23.668 --> 23:25.925
Try me, if this is going to work,

23:25.925 --> 23:27.595
you need to follow the plan.

23:27.595 --> 23:29.949
- [Ruth] I am following the plan.

23:29.949 --> 23:31.389
I'm doing God's work,

23:31.389 --> 23:33.536
but let justice roll down like waters

23:33.536 --> 23:35.627
and righteousness like
an ever flowing stream.

23:35.627 --> 23:38.430
When justice is done, it
is a joy to the righteous,

23:38.430 --> 23:40.552
but terror to evil doers.

23:40.552 --> 23:42.870
- [PJ] I don't think
quoting Bible scripture

23:42.870 --> 23:46.578
will insure you or me never
see the inside of a jail cell.

23:46.578 --> 23:49.318
Stay focused.
- I am focused.

23:49.318 --> 23:50.644
(engine revving)

23:50.644 --> 23:53.650
(suspenseful music)

23:53.650 --> 23:58.051
- You know, I don't have
anything against white people

23:58.051 --> 24:00.134
or any other ethnicities,

24:01.607 --> 24:04.857
but when it does come to relationships,

24:05.785 --> 24:08.589
possibly building a family,

24:08.589 --> 24:11.160
I can't really see myself
with a white woman.

24:11.160 --> 24:13.640
I don't think she understands
the ideals and desires

24:13.640 --> 24:15.473
of a strong black man.

24:16.401 --> 24:17.776
You ever dated a white guy?

24:17.776 --> 24:22.776
(ominous sounds)
(labored breathing)

24:33.296 --> 24:35.111
- You know, it's like
a spiritual awakening

24:35.111 --> 24:37.947
when we have these conversations.

24:37.947 --> 24:39.795
- I see you're good at deflection.

24:39.795 --> 24:42.284
- No, I just never had
these types of conversations

24:42.284 --> 24:44.284
in my last relationship.

24:45.474 --> 24:47.490
- So, we're in a relationship, now?

24:47.490 --> 24:49.024
- You know what I mean, Zack.

24:49.024 --> 24:50.746
I like whatever we are.

24:50.746 --> 24:52.541
You're the first person
I met when I got here

24:52.541 --> 24:54.440
and I just appreciate you.

24:54.440 --> 24:56.854
- Okay, so who were you having
these types of conversations

24:56.854 --> 24:58.274
with last time?

24:58.274 --> 24:59.274
- My father.

25:00.113 --> 25:01.581
- So what was it like growing up with him?

25:01.581 --> 25:02.414
- It was good.

25:02.414 --> 25:03.955
He was a merchant Marine.

25:03.955 --> 25:05.708
- Oh, so he worked on the water a lot.

25:05.708 --> 25:07.746
- Yes, but when he was
home, he taught me a lot.

25:07.746 --> 25:09.110
(pensive music)

25:09.110 --> 25:09.943
- Interesting.

25:09.943 --> 25:12.815
- [Ruth] Just the other day,
I was riding down the 101

25:12.815 --> 25:15.684
and I saw a live RC racing event.

25:15.684 --> 25:17.059
I just had to stop.

25:17.059 --> 25:19.410
It reminded me of when
I was a little girl.

25:19.410 --> 25:21.754
My dad used to take me.

25:21.754 --> 25:23.129
He would teach me life lessons

25:23.129 --> 25:25.540
like always be the bigger person

25:25.540 --> 25:27.676
and you have a purpose in life

25:27.676 --> 25:29.281
and so many other things.

25:29.281 --> 25:32.767
There was a little girl there
that reminded me of myself.

25:32.767 --> 25:36.544
Her dad thought she was
bothering me but in reality,

25:36.544 --> 25:38.879
she was just reassurance from God to me.

25:38.879 --> 25:41.876
I thought I was alone
and I didn't have to be.

25:41.876 --> 25:44.171
Now, I'm just realizing
that God is trying to use me

25:44.171 --> 25:46.828
and I'm allowing him to, so, I'm here.

25:46.828 --> 25:47.991
- That's interesting.

25:47.991 --> 25:52.175
(phone vibrating)
Hold on, a sec.

25:52.175 --> 25:55.493
Hello?
(pensive music)

25:55.493 --> 25:56.410
Who's this?

25:59.346 --> 26:00.679
I'm sorry, what?

26:01.591 --> 26:02.663
How did you get my number?

26:02.663 --> 26:05.329
(pensive music)

26:05.329 --> 26:07.113
Did you say you're locked
in the back of the trunk?

26:07.113 --> 26:09.211
(suspenseful music)

26:09.211 --> 26:11.544
- You got information on me?

26:12.750 --> 26:13.977
Hold on.

26:13.977 --> 26:16.590
This phone breaking up.

26:16.590 --> 26:17.757
Where are you?

26:19.048 --> 26:21.215
Arbonne McNabb, black car?

26:22.450 --> 26:24.914
Yo, if you lying, you go straight to jail.

26:24.914 --> 26:25.939
Don't die on the way!

26:25.939 --> 26:28.380
(pensive music)

26:28.380 --> 26:29.213
I'm so sorry.

26:29.213 --> 26:31.880
(pensive music)

26:34.076 --> 26:36.159
- Fairy godfather, again?

26:37.388 --> 26:38.221
- I don't know.

26:38.221 --> 26:39.092
I just feel like somebody up above

26:39.092 --> 26:42.682
is trying to help me solve this thing.

26:42.682 --> 26:43.574
Catch you later, all right?

26:43.574 --> 26:45.885
(pensive music)

26:45.885 --> 26:48.103
- Okay, call me later.
- I got you.

26:48.103 --> 26:50.853
(pensive music)

26:59.861 --> 27:02.611
(car door shuts)

27:06.446 --> 27:07.892
- [Detective Parkinson] Zach.

27:07.892 --> 27:09.026
- What the hell are you doing here?

27:09.026 --> 27:10.747
- You have a government issued car.

27:10.747 --> 27:12.440
Of course, I tracked you here.

27:12.440 --> 27:15.254
I need to get into that database tonight.

27:15.254 --> 27:18.057
- Listen, I'm not gonna cover
some valuable information

27:18.057 --> 27:20.093
in regards to this kidnapping girl's case.

27:20.093 --> 27:22.655
And the last thing I need
is some illegal immigrant

27:22.655 --> 27:24.074
trying to harass me.

27:24.074 --> 27:27.621
- I ain't trying cramp your
style, but I got a job to do.

27:27.621 --> 27:29.354
Yes, I am West Indian.

27:29.354 --> 27:32.871
Just because I wasn't born
here as a black American,

27:32.871 --> 27:34.350
my ancestors were slaves,

27:34.350 --> 27:36.442
just like your ancestors were slaves.

27:36.442 --> 27:38.942
I don't believe I'm above anybody

27:38.942 --> 27:41.104
but it has nothing to do with this case

27:41.104 --> 27:42.879
and us as being black men.

27:42.879 --> 27:44.485
I'm tired of this shit, man.

27:44.485 --> 27:46.346
What's that got to do with anything?

27:46.346 --> 27:48.614
So we can just get past that

27:48.614 --> 27:51.919
and we can get done
what we got to get done.

27:51.919 --> 27:54.480
- Yeah, and what are the chances of that?

27:54.480 --> 27:57.547
Who's to say she's not
already in Mexico or dead?

27:57.547 --> 27:58.692
- Look, to be honest with you,

27:58.692 --> 28:00.350
I don't know if I'm gonna get Kennedy,

28:00.350 --> 28:02.755
but I can use my intel,
put it together with yours,

28:02.755 --> 28:04.783
so we can crack this missing woman's case.

28:04.783 --> 28:06.866
That sound good with you?

28:07.973 --> 28:10.076
- Nah, that's not going to happen.

28:10.076 --> 28:10.937
- Why not?

28:10.937 --> 28:12.763
- Because I had my own intelligence

28:12.763 --> 28:14.981
and I'm this close to busting this case.

28:14.981 --> 28:17.731
(metal knocking)

28:18.612 --> 28:20.304
- Yo, what the hell is that?

28:20.304 --> 28:22.076
Is that your lead?

28:22.076 --> 28:23.179
Look, think about it.

28:23.179 --> 28:25.435
You got access to a lot more databases.

28:25.435 --> 28:28.062
Just bring me on board and
we get equal credit for it.

28:28.062 --> 28:30.120
And your local missing girl's case,

28:30.120 --> 28:33.374
could lead to nowhere,
without government intel.

28:33.374 --> 28:35.390
- Fine, just follow my lead.

28:35.390 --> 28:36.420
And when this is done,

28:36.420 --> 28:38.235
they're going to give
you a medal for this.

28:38.235 --> 28:39.453
- If we're going after missing girls,

28:39.453 --> 28:41.617
it's probably way bigger than we expected.

28:41.617 --> 28:43.454
- Look bruh, I understood the risk

28:43.454 --> 28:46.005
when I took this job, all right.

28:46.005 --> 28:47.391
- Open it.

28:47.391 --> 28:49.808
(soft music)

28:51.727 --> 28:53.843
- Yo, what the hell?

28:53.843 --> 28:54.890
All right, start talking.

28:54.890 --> 28:56.266
How did you get my number?

28:56.266 --> 29:00.099
And what other information
do you have for me?

29:01.930 --> 29:03.556
- You guys are cops?

29:03.556 --> 29:04.564
Shit!

29:04.564 --> 29:07.314
(rhythmic music)

29:38.741 --> 29:40.042
(banging on metal)

29:40.042 --> 29:40.875
- Dang!

29:43.839 --> 29:45.010
(bell rings)

29:45.010 --> 29:47.351
(rhythmic music)

29:47.351 --> 29:49.101
- How can I help you?

29:51.077 --> 29:52.331
(key jangles)

29:52.331 --> 29:55.164
(rhythmic music)

30:09.194 --> 30:12.114
(key jangles)

30:12.114 --> 30:13.362
- Wrap it up.

30:13.362 --> 30:16.112
(rhythmic music)

30:23.118 --> 30:25.962
(fluid spraying)

30:25.962 --> 30:28.545
(upbeat music)

30:33.545 --> 30:35.004
- [Tony] Ruth, ready to go?

30:35.004 --> 30:36.484
- Thank you, Tony.

30:36.484 --> 30:38.380
- I only wish it could be more.

30:38.380 --> 30:39.934
- I think paying me in cash is plenty.

30:39.934 --> 30:41.853
You have no idea what you're doing for me.

30:41.853 --> 30:43.101
- No Ruth, thank you.

30:43.101 --> 30:44.742
This place is always clean

30:44.742 --> 30:46.820
and you're really enjoyed
in the women's group.

30:46.820 --> 30:48.416
- Just a perk on the job.

30:48.416 --> 30:52.638
- Listen, I want you to know that I know.

30:52.638 --> 30:54.471
- Um, know what, Tony?

30:55.503 --> 30:57.812
- You're Canadian.

30:57.812 --> 30:58.645
- Oh.

30:58.645 --> 31:00.618
- I was just watching the
special on TV last night.

31:00.618 --> 31:02.676
All these Canadians
are hiding in this city

31:02.676 --> 31:05.028
on expired work visas.

31:05.028 --> 31:05.899
- You did?

31:05.899 --> 31:07.011
- I mean, it all makes sense.

31:07.011 --> 31:08.304
You can only take cash.

31:08.304 --> 31:09.542
We don't know where you live.

31:09.542 --> 31:11.065
You don't hang out.

31:11.065 --> 31:12.661
I get it.

31:12.661 --> 31:15.811
- Tony, you're such a lovable fool.

31:15.811 --> 31:17.522
- I mean, I wish I could pay you more.

31:17.522 --> 31:19.191
COVID hit us pretty hard.

31:19.191 --> 31:22.338
- If it were up to me, I'd be paying you.

31:22.338 --> 31:25.208
- Ladies, let's get started!

31:25.208 --> 31:26.583
- I love you ladies so much.

31:26.583 --> 31:28.471
Thank you, thank you.

31:28.471 --> 31:30.091
Things have been so much better lately

31:30.091 --> 31:32.535
and I feel like I've been blessed.

31:32.535 --> 31:33.577
God is great.

31:33.577 --> 31:35.244
And Mitch got a job.

31:36.391 --> 31:37.323
- God is good.

31:37.323 --> 31:39.320
We're so happy for you.

31:39.320 --> 31:42.302
- That's great, Gina and no pun intended,

31:42.302 --> 31:44.738
but sometimes life beats
the hell out of you,

31:44.738 --> 31:45.883
then blesses you.

31:45.883 --> 31:47.709
I've got no idea why.

31:47.709 --> 31:49.694
- It's because there's evil in this world.

31:49.694 --> 31:52.875
Eve bit the apple and
God let hell be on earth.

31:52.875 --> 31:54.006
- Oh hell no.
(group murmuring)

31:54.006 --> 31:57.093
- Hmm hmm, first of all,
we're all forgiven, okay?

31:57.093 --> 31:58.510
Hmm hmm, hmm hmm.

32:00.050 --> 32:01.377
- Ladies, ladies, ladies,

32:01.377 --> 32:03.413
everyone's entitled to her opinion.

32:03.413 --> 32:05.387
Sarah, tell us more.

32:05.387 --> 32:06.280
- Please do.

32:06.280 --> 32:08.307
'Cause last time, you sounded different.

32:08.307 --> 32:11.194
- Hold on, we don't judge here.

32:11.194 --> 32:12.580
- No, she's right.

32:12.580 --> 32:14.943
I just feel really strongly against abuse.

32:14.943 --> 32:17.536
But as a Christian, I
do believe our society

32:17.536 --> 32:21.926
is on a downturn and a very
big reason can be blamed on us.

32:21.926 --> 32:23.655
- And Ruth, how do you feel about that?

32:23.655 --> 32:25.503
- I don't want to take
over this session, Tony.

32:25.503 --> 32:26.595
- No, it's okay, Ruth.

32:26.595 --> 32:28.844
I want to hear your opinion
and we never hear from you.

32:28.844 --> 32:30.039
- Not me.

32:30.039 --> 32:31.708
- [Tony] This is a safe place, Ruth.

32:31.708 --> 32:32.541
- I don't know.

32:32.541 --> 32:33.377
I was just thinking,

32:33.377 --> 32:35.709
us women get the blame
for the worst of society

32:35.709 --> 32:37.714
as if we're the mucus of the body.

32:37.714 --> 32:38.618
Maybe sometimes,

32:38.618 --> 32:40.654
we just find ourselves
in adverse situations

32:40.654 --> 32:42.093
and maybe sometimes,

32:42.093 --> 32:44.736
the best and only option
is to bite the apple.

32:44.736 --> 32:47.606
(loud crunching)

32:47.606 --> 32:48.729
- Girl, what?

32:48.729 --> 32:51.479
(group laughing)

32:53.570 --> 32:55.395
- Ruth, last year alone,

32:55.395 --> 32:58.504
women initiated nearly
70% of all divorces.

32:58.504 --> 33:00.856
- Yes, maybe, but like
what led them to doing so?

33:00.856 --> 33:02.450
It's not all peaches and cream.

33:02.450 --> 33:04.675
- And it's not always the man's fault.

33:04.675 --> 33:06.610
(scoffs) When did us
women forget to grow up

33:06.610 --> 33:08.385
and accept reality?

33:08.385 --> 33:11.314
It's all, hashtag goals
and pretty pictures.

33:11.314 --> 33:12.814
We are delusional.

33:13.929 --> 33:15.410
- Don't say that.

33:15.410 --> 33:16.595
Please, don't say that.

33:16.595 --> 33:18.819
This is just really hard for me.

33:18.819 --> 33:20.344
And I know a lot of
you don't know my story

33:20.344 --> 33:21.951
and that's not your fault.

33:21.951 --> 33:24.217
I just, nevermind.

33:24.217 --> 33:26.171
I don't mean to be this way, I'm sorry.

33:26.171 --> 33:27.663
- We don't label here, Ruth.

33:27.663 --> 33:29.690
You're unique and wonderful.

33:29.690 --> 33:31.535
- No, I'm not.

33:31.535 --> 33:34.306
I've seen evil and I've contributed to it.

33:34.306 --> 33:35.408
- Come on Ruth.

33:35.408 --> 33:36.881
- No, let her finish.

33:36.881 --> 33:38.824
I appreciate her honesty.

33:38.824 --> 33:40.294
- Don't be so hard on yourself.

33:40.294 --> 33:41.439
You're here.

33:41.439 --> 33:46.356
The journey of a thousand miles
begins with the first step.

33:47.560 --> 33:49.239
- I don't know.

33:49.239 --> 33:52.704
I just think sometimes, I hate me.

33:52.704 --> 33:55.215
The world already hates me

33:55.215 --> 33:59.214
and because he tried to
kill me, I fought back

33:59.214 --> 34:01.000
and things went bad.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.582
They got worse and worse.

34:03.582 --> 34:07.426
I was in love with the player, a whore,

34:07.426 --> 34:10.722
and because he was, is a man,

34:10.722 --> 34:13.639
I was just supposed to accept that?

34:15.758 --> 34:18.735
- Okay, Ruth, no one really
wants to kill anybody.

34:18.735 --> 34:21.003
They say it, but they don't mean it.

34:21.003 --> 34:23.253
- Ruth, you are so astute

34:23.253 --> 34:25.271
and personally, I stand with you, girl,

34:25.271 --> 34:26.603
for trying to kill him.

34:26.603 --> 34:28.630
My ass would have done the same thing,

34:28.630 --> 34:30.552
if I found out mine was cheating.

34:30.552 --> 34:34.396
Unfortunately, for a generation
of women that want equality,

34:34.396 --> 34:37.608
we sure don't use an equal
amount of logic as men do.

34:37.608 --> 34:38.918
I'm just as guilty.

34:38.918 --> 34:41.063
I just choose to accept reality.

34:41.063 --> 34:42.856
- Okay, we've heard from you Ruth.

34:42.856 --> 34:44.781
Now, let's hear from Sarah.

34:44.781 --> 34:46.523
- I live a clean life.

34:46.523 --> 34:49.913
I don't even steal cable
or should I say, stream it,

34:49.913 --> 34:51.574
but it wasn't always like that.

34:51.574 --> 34:54.293
Before, my husband and I were poor

34:54.293 --> 34:56.866
and I was a complete bitch.

34:56.866 --> 35:00.279
I was not this belle of the
ball, we shall overcome,

35:00.279 --> 35:02.890
I support you no matter
what, baby type of girl.

35:02.890 --> 35:04.740
I was a bitch.

35:04.740 --> 35:06.243
I would threaten to leave him.

35:06.243 --> 35:08.133
I would threaten to take our kids.

35:08.133 --> 35:09.896
I would threaten to see other men.

35:09.896 --> 35:11.765
And we fought.

35:11.765 --> 35:14.179
I brought a lot of that out of him

35:14.179 --> 35:16.416
and I take responsibility for that.

35:16.416 --> 35:18.885
I never allowed him to
put his hands on me.

35:18.885 --> 35:21.982
And I was blessed that he
created a career for himself.

35:21.982 --> 35:24.648
But now, I recognize
my place and accept it.

35:24.648 --> 35:26.380
Once I started to support him,

35:26.380 --> 35:28.503
and once I actually
started to encourage him,

35:28.503 --> 35:29.825
things got better.

35:29.825 --> 35:31.642
Now, I'm blessed to live a great life

35:31.642 --> 35:32.964
and he makes great money.

35:32.964 --> 35:36.931
I used to be a terrible
life partner and wife,

35:36.931 --> 35:37.827
but not anymore.

35:37.827 --> 35:40.410
(upbeat music)

35:48.610 --> 35:49.943
Ruth, Ruth, hey.

35:51.313 --> 35:52.242
I thought I missed you.

35:52.242 --> 35:53.619
- I'm sorry, I had headphones on.

35:53.619 --> 35:54.452
I didn't hear you.

35:54.452 --> 35:55.285
- It's okay.

35:55.285 --> 35:57.304
It was really nice hearing
from you in class today.

35:57.304 --> 35:58.312
- Even if I don't attribute

35:58.312 --> 36:00.590
all of society's problems to women?

36:00.590 --> 36:02.369
- Ruth, that's not what I was saying.

36:02.369 --> 36:05.550
I simply think there's too
much emphasis, in general,

36:05.550 --> 36:07.541
on women choosing the wrong partners.

36:07.541 --> 36:10.022
As if every year, there's
not cautionary tales

36:10.022 --> 36:12.342
and mantras created and circulated

36:12.342 --> 36:14.737
around popular stage plays, books

36:14.737 --> 36:17.204
and even movies that exemplify Mr. Wrong.

36:17.204 --> 36:20.690
And if every year as if a
rite of passage to women,

36:20.690 --> 36:24.134
we end up in relationships with Mr. Wrong.

36:24.134 --> 36:26.959
I didn't come here to
bash or criticize women.

36:26.959 --> 36:28.365
I love us.

36:28.365 --> 36:30.949
I would just like more of us
to hold ourselves accountable

36:30.949 --> 36:32.649
for systematically choosing Mr. Wrong

36:32.649 --> 36:34.163
the majority of the time.

36:34.163 --> 36:36.230
Sometimes, it is our fault.

36:36.230 --> 36:38.226
No one better lay a hand on us,

36:38.226 --> 36:42.256
but we can be vindictive,
manipulative and just cause,

36:42.256 --> 36:43.906
what word can I use?

36:43.906 --> 36:45.312
A noxious mess.

36:45.312 --> 36:47.338
- This is my partner, Duvall Parkinson.

36:47.338 --> 36:48.830
He's been helping me get to the bottom

36:48.830 --> 36:51.666
of what's been happening to
you and your friends at night.

36:51.666 --> 36:55.194
- [Ruth] Nothing short of a noxious mess.

36:55.194 --> 36:56.777
- So, how about it?

36:57.818 --> 36:58.651
- I'm sorry, Sarah.

36:58.651 --> 37:00.245
How about what?

37:00.245 --> 37:01.914
- (scoffs) My birthday party?

37:01.914 --> 37:03.456
My place, Saturday.

37:03.456 --> 37:07.142
No kids, just adults, drinks and cake.

37:07.142 --> 37:08.822
- Hmm, can I bring a friend?

37:08.822 --> 37:11.112
Let me find out you got a man, Ruth.

37:11.112 --> 37:12.487
Of course, who knows?

37:12.487 --> 37:13.873
Maybe, we'll become friends.

37:13.873 --> 37:15.710
Hold on one second, I'm sorry.

37:15.710 --> 37:17.044
Hello?

37:17.044 --> 37:17.877
Hey, baby.

37:18.989 --> 37:22.643
I'm just inviting a friend
to my party on Saturday.

37:22.643 --> 37:24.869
Yeah, I can pick that up for you.

37:24.869 --> 37:26.759
Okay, I gotta go.

37:26.759 --> 37:27.831
I gotta go baby, I gotta go.

37:27.831 --> 37:29.270
I love you, too.

37:29.270 --> 37:30.103
Okay.

37:31.232 --> 37:32.385
Sorry about that, girl.

37:32.385 --> 37:35.044
Tib's always has me
picking up things for him.

37:35.044 --> 37:36.850
- What's Tib short for?

37:36.850 --> 37:37.783
- Don't laugh.

37:37.783 --> 37:39.921
It's short for Tiberon.

37:39.921 --> 37:41.321
(pensive music)
I know it's silly girl,

37:41.321 --> 37:43.943
but a lot of guys are calling
themselves that nowadays.

37:43.943 --> 37:45.048
I'll see you Saturday.

37:45.048 --> 37:46.215
I'll text you.

37:47.388 --> 37:48.976
- Bye, Sarah.

37:48.976 --> 37:50.519
Ruth, heading out?

37:50.519 --> 37:52.186
- Yeah, in a second.

37:53.775 --> 37:56.358
(rhythmic music)

37:56.358 --> 37:57.891
- We've been at it for 24 hours.

37:57.891 --> 38:00.348
This Tiberon is not in your database.

38:00.348 --> 38:02.270
Thanks for your lead, Jack.

38:02.270 --> 38:03.729
- First of all, if it wasn't for my lead,

38:03.729 --> 38:07.569
we wouldn't even be close. (faint talking)

38:07.569 --> 38:09.618
- And the guy is still not talking.

38:09.618 --> 38:11.508
They say, they'll kill him if he does.

38:11.508 --> 38:14.556
Plus my guy in Atlanta says
that the tablets are encrypted.

38:14.556 --> 38:16.962
So we can't even backtrack
to find 'em if we wanted to.

38:16.962 --> 38:18.927
So basically, we from square one.

38:18.927 --> 38:20.501
- Nah player, that ain't true.

38:20.501 --> 38:22.604
Check this out with your hating ass.

38:22.604 --> 38:23.437
- I beg your pardon?

38:23.437 --> 38:24.752
- I said, look.

38:24.752 --> 38:27.224
Three men were arrested in
the would-be bank robbery.

38:27.224 --> 38:29.112
The fourth suspect who
is still unidentified

38:29.112 --> 38:31.078
fled with over $40,000 in cash.

38:31.078 --> 38:33.536
But if you cross reference it with this,

38:33.536 --> 38:34.953
you get this right here.

38:34.953 --> 38:38.786
Man, under investigation for
posting $30,000 on, what?

38:38.786 --> 38:40.203
With marked cash?

38:41.662 --> 38:44.518
- Suspect went by the street name Tiberon.

38:44.518 --> 38:46.262
Click over.

38:46.262 --> 38:47.385
(keys clicking)

38:47.385 --> 38:48.498
- Yo, what the hell man?

38:48.498 --> 38:50.831
I thought I had full access.

38:51.742 --> 38:54.547
- Zach, somebody does not
want you to know something.

38:54.547 --> 38:57.907
(suspenseful music)

38:57.907 --> 38:59.019
Hello?

38:59.019 --> 39:01.024
I need clearance on a COCOM.

39:01.024 --> 39:03.661
Suspect with the Phoenix PD.

39:03.661 --> 39:06.181
(suspenseful music)

39:06.181 --> 39:08.656
- Okay, so she's like a friend from work

39:08.656 --> 39:12.569
but we don't work together,
but we're in a woman's group.

39:12.569 --> 39:14.411
- Okay, so how do y'all
expect to throw a party

39:14.411 --> 39:15.828
and social distance?

39:15.828 --> 39:17.730
- [Ruth] Don't be funny.

39:17.730 --> 39:19.986
- Girl, I'm an enforcer of the law.

39:19.986 --> 39:21.414
It's my job.

39:21.414 --> 39:23.414
- If you only knew know.

39:24.408 --> 39:26.695
- You know, I'm so glad
Jaiye's going to be there.

39:26.695 --> 39:28.375
You know, I gotta find that boy a wife.

39:28.375 --> 39:29.208
- Says the young officer

39:29.208 --> 39:31.778
who has sworn off ever
getting married again, right.

39:31.778 --> 39:34.016
- (laughs) Nah, I'm serious.

39:34.016 --> 39:36.261
Yo, Jaiye, he's different.

39:36.261 --> 39:38.911
You know, he's God-fearing man.

39:38.911 --> 39:40.581
He wants a family

39:40.581 --> 39:43.489
and my job is to make sure
that brother don't get played.

39:43.489 --> 39:47.142
- So you bring him to a
married woman's birthday party?

39:47.142 --> 39:49.789
- Absolutely.
(Briona laughing)

39:49.789 --> 39:51.009
Do you know how many women there

39:51.009 --> 39:54.335
are going to want to get
married after we cut that cake?

39:54.335 --> 39:55.168
- Oh Lord.

39:58.482 --> 39:59.886
- Oh, what up man?
- What's up?

39:59.886 --> 40:01.086
- I see you came through, bruh.

40:01.086 --> 40:02.105
Had to see you man.

40:02.105 --> 40:03.984
- Oh, let me introduce you to Ruth.

40:03.984 --> 40:05.434
- Hi, Ruth.
- Hi, Jaiye.

40:05.434 --> 40:06.588
I've heard a lot about you.

40:06.588 --> 40:07.996
- Is that right?

40:07.996 --> 40:09.077
- Let's go up in the party, y'all.

40:09.077 --> 40:10.244
- Let's do it.

40:15.766 --> 40:17.458
- Hey, how's it going?

40:17.458 --> 40:18.634
Come on in.

40:18.634 --> 40:20.020
It's nice to see you.

40:20.020 --> 40:20.853
Thanks for coming.

40:20.853 --> 40:21.750
Hi, how are you doing?

40:21.750 --> 40:22.960
- Hi, nice to see you.
- Nice to see you, too.

40:22.960 --> 40:24.052
Thank you for coming.

40:24.052 --> 40:25.885
Hi, thanks for coming.

40:30.301 --> 40:31.812
Party is a little smaller than I thought,

40:31.812 --> 40:33.062
you know COVID, girl.

40:33.062 --> 40:35.075
But let me introduce you to someone.

40:35.075 --> 40:36.115
Babe, honey, come down here.

40:36.115 --> 40:39.032
I want to introduce you to someone.

40:43.782 --> 40:45.744
Babe, this is Ruth from my women's group

40:45.744 --> 40:47.371
and these are her friends.

40:47.371 --> 40:48.788
- Hey, I'm Jaiye.

40:50.586 --> 40:52.182
- Guys, John's getting over a cold

40:52.182 --> 40:54.396
and he's kind of a germaphobe.

40:54.396 --> 40:56.141
- Damn, the flu, girl.

40:56.141 --> 40:58.199
Trying to stay COVID-free.

40:58.199 --> 41:01.146
- Do you go by any other names, John?

41:01.146 --> 41:02.197
- Nah, Ruth.

41:02.197 --> 41:04.117
John's pretty simple as it gets.

41:04.117 --> 41:06.355
- Ruth, you so crazy.

41:06.355 --> 41:07.344
- What's up Zack?

41:07.344 --> 41:08.594
This your lady?

41:10.659 --> 41:12.361
- Something like that.

41:12.361 --> 41:13.767
- Nice, why don't we go
to the kitchen, guys?

41:13.767 --> 41:16.245
We've got some food and drinks.

41:16.245 --> 41:18.868
- Yo, looks like everybody's
social distancing

41:18.868 --> 41:20.812
which is good.

41:20.812 --> 41:23.270
- Brother, you off duty.

41:23.270 --> 41:24.265
It's the weekend.

41:24.265 --> 41:25.461
Relax, man.

41:25.461 --> 41:26.482
- Man, I am chill, man.

41:26.482 --> 41:27.482
I'm relaxed.

41:29.158 --> 41:30.991
Wait, yo, who is that?

41:32.415 --> 41:33.801
Who's who?

41:33.801 --> 41:36.718
- Yo, I think I'm looking
at my wife, in Jesus' name.

41:36.718 --> 41:38.330
- Oh okay, I see that.

41:38.330 --> 41:39.175
We'll get that, bro.

41:39.175 --> 41:40.152
- How do I look?

41:40.152 --> 41:40.985
- You straight, man.

41:40.985 --> 41:43.193
- Yeah.
- You straight, you gravy.

41:43.193 --> 41:44.443
- Breath check.

41:45.545 --> 41:46.805
- Breath is straight, bruh.

41:46.805 --> 41:47.638
- All right, man.

41:47.638 --> 41:49.303
All right, brother, hey, pray for me.

41:49.303 --> 41:52.778
- Hey, remember, you can do
all things through Christ.

41:52.778 --> 41:53.912
Go get it.

41:53.912 --> 41:55.729
- One.
- All right.

41:55.729 --> 41:59.161
(soft instrumental music)

41:59.161 --> 42:02.858
- You know you can have a seat, right?

42:02.858 --> 42:05.108
- So, uh, what's your name?

42:06.083 --> 42:07.604
- Hi, I'm Sky.

42:07.604 --> 42:11.473
(soft instrumental music)

42:11.473 --> 42:14.954
- (laughs) My dude, I see you.

42:14.954 --> 42:16.508
That boy crazy.

42:16.508 --> 42:18.095
- Hey.
- What's good, what's good?

42:18.095 --> 42:19.687
- You enjoying yourself so far?

42:19.687 --> 42:21.349
- You know it.
- Good.

42:21.349 --> 42:23.062
- I'm going to go to the
restroom really quick, babe.

42:23.062 --> 42:24.871
Do you want me to get you
a drink on the way back?

42:24.871 --> 42:25.704
- I mean, I'm good.

42:25.704 --> 42:26.537
But, I appreciate it, though.

42:26.537 --> 42:27.370
- Okay.

42:27.370 --> 42:28.203
(soft instrumental music)

42:28.203 --> 42:29.726
- Oh, I didn't know I was babe.

42:29.726 --> 42:31.288
- Don't go falling in love, Mr. Parkinson.

42:31.288 --> 42:34.788
(soft instrumental music)

42:37.075 --> 42:39.690
- So your girl just gonna
leave it like that...

42:39.690 --> 42:42.522
(soft instrumental music)

42:42.522 --> 42:44.580
(door shuts)

42:44.580 --> 42:45.413
- Yo, Sky.

42:47.554 --> 42:49.377
Is everything good?

42:49.377 --> 42:50.877
- I'm fine, Henry.

42:52.152 --> 42:53.536
- Yo Henry, she's good.

42:53.536 --> 42:57.036
(soft instrumental music)

43:13.457 --> 43:15.022
- Oh, hell yeah.

43:15.022 --> 43:16.920
Let me call Zack.

43:16.920 --> 43:19.240
- Hey man, we usually hang out
in the back of the backyard,

43:19.240 --> 43:21.456
but grill broke down, so,

43:21.456 --> 43:23.104
I'm out here enjoying the sun, you know?

43:23.104 --> 43:24.664
- I feel it, man.

43:24.664 --> 43:26.621
- Hey, so how you know Ruth?

43:26.621 --> 43:30.126
- Actually bro, I met her online, Tinder.

43:30.126 --> 43:31.451
- So nothing serious like that?

43:31.451 --> 43:33.295
- I mean, man,

43:33.295 --> 43:34.922
you can't take these women's
serious these days, man.

43:34.922 --> 43:36.576
You know, I'm always on my toes, man.

43:36.576 --> 43:38.413
- I feel you, man.
- Hmm hmm.

43:38.413 --> 43:40.091
- I see a red pill
divorce, when I see one.

43:40.091 --> 43:41.249
- (laughs) Come on, bro.

43:41.249 --> 43:43.127
It can't be that easy,
man, you can pick that up?

43:43.127 --> 43:44.386
- It ain't my first rodeo, man.

43:44.386 --> 43:46.561
(Zachariah laughing)

43:46.561 --> 43:48.126
- Man.

43:48.126 --> 43:48.959
(phone vibrating)

43:48.959 --> 43:50.792
Yo, hold that thought.

43:52.399 --> 43:53.712
Oh, shoot, yo, I gotta take this man.

43:53.712 --> 43:56.064
I'll be right back.

43:56.064 --> 43:57.996
- Yo Zack hello?

43:57.996 --> 43:58.949
- Yeah, what's up Parkinson

43:58.949 --> 44:00.032
What you want?

44:00.032 --> 44:03.884
- Yeah, meet me at 1451 Mahogany Road.

44:03.884 --> 44:05.501
- What's the address?

44:05.501 --> 44:07.817
- Hey, I got to address to Tiberon.

44:07.817 --> 44:10.678
Meet me at 1451 Mahogany Road.

44:10.678 --> 44:13.567
- Nah, nah, nah, nah, that can't be right.

44:13.567 --> 44:15.993
Like I said, that's impossible.

44:15.993 --> 44:18.406
That's impossible, 'cause
I'm here right now.

44:18.406 --> 44:20.696
(ominous music)

44:20.696 --> 44:21.652
- You already there?

44:21.652 --> 44:24.402
(ominous music)

45:13.529 --> 45:15.453
- Hey, what are you doing?

45:15.453 --> 45:17.122
- [Tiberon] Was somebody in here?

45:17.122 --> 45:19.013
- No, but why don't you come downstairs?

45:19.013 --> 45:20.763
We're having a party.

45:26.464 --> 45:28.051
- Okay.

45:28.051 --> 45:29.899
- I thought I told you
not to open my drawer.

45:29.899 --> 45:31.860
Babe, I'm sorry, but it was sticking out.

45:31.860 --> 45:33.321
- No, you screwed up.

45:33.321 --> 45:34.154
- How?

45:35.287 --> 45:37.374
- I think your friend's boyfriend is a cop

45:37.374 --> 45:38.689
and his buddy, too.

45:38.689 --> 45:39.873
- Okay, so?

45:39.873 --> 45:43.569
- So, I don't want cops in my house.

45:43.569 --> 45:44.756
Look-
- Okay.

45:44.756 --> 45:47.612
- Look, go to the bank and
take as much money as possible.

45:47.612 --> 45:50.827
Get yourself a burner phone,
but don't call me, text me.

45:50.827 --> 45:51.660
- Okay.

45:54.565 --> 45:56.527
- Use WhatsApp, okay?

45:56.527 --> 45:58.448
And I'll tell you what to do after.

45:58.448 --> 45:59.698
- [Sarah] Okay.

46:01.459 --> 46:04.045
- Okay, I love you.
- I love you, too.

46:04.045 --> 46:07.045
(suspenseful music)

46:36.293 --> 46:39.043
(rhythmic music)

46:49.417 --> 46:51.455
- Yo man, it got dark mad quick, man.

46:51.455 --> 46:53.155
It's daylight savings time, already?

46:53.155 --> 46:54.888
- For real, yo, it got chilly, too.

46:54.888 --> 46:56.503
(Zachariah laughs)
You feel me?

46:56.503 --> 46:57.355
- I don't know, man.

46:57.355 --> 46:59.004
But yo, man, check this out, man.

46:59.004 --> 46:59.837
- What's up?

46:59.837 --> 47:00.978
- I got off the phone
with Detective Parkinson.

47:00.978 --> 47:03.246
He thinks, oh boy, is Tiberon.

47:03.246 --> 47:04.306
- Word?
- Yeah.

47:04.306 --> 47:05.742
- Nah.
- Yeah.

47:05.742 --> 47:06.993
- Here?
- Yeah.

47:06.993 --> 47:08.588
- Nah, bruh, I don't
think that's possible.

47:08.588 --> 47:11.005
- Yeah, what's going on here?

47:11.845 --> 47:14.928
- You see that?
- Yeah, check it out.

47:16.751 --> 47:17.625
- Hey, what's up Sarah?

47:17.625 --> 47:18.672
- Hey, hey, how's it going?

47:18.672 --> 47:19.630
- Everything all right?

47:19.630 --> 47:21.699
- Yeah, why, what's up?

47:21.699 --> 47:23.452
- I don't know, you tell me.

47:23.452 --> 47:24.975
- Oh, uh, nothing.

47:24.975 --> 47:27.095
I'mma just go to the store
real quick but I'mma be back.

47:27.095 --> 47:29.101
- Okay, is Ruth still in the house?

47:29.101 --> 47:30.216
- Yeah, she should be in the house.

47:30.216 --> 47:31.790
- She's good?
- Yeah, she's okay.

47:31.790 --> 47:32.778
- All right.

47:32.778 --> 47:34.217
- Okay.
- Okay, talk to you later.

47:34.217 --> 47:36.300
- All right.
- Drive safe.

47:39.112 --> 47:41.052
Shorty was kind of...
- She was.

47:41.052 --> 47:43.119
Yo, I'm telling you bro,
something's going on, man.

47:43.119 --> 47:44.132
- It was a little sketchy.

47:44.132 --> 47:46.025
- The detective is right.

47:46.025 --> 47:46.947
Something's going on, man.

47:46.947 --> 47:48.668
- Are you armed?
- Absolutely.

47:48.668 --> 47:52.049
- We might have to-
- I always stay strapped.

47:52.049 --> 47:55.170
I just gotta make sure Ruth is good.

47:55.170 --> 47:56.145
- Yeah, Ruth...

47:56.145 --> 47:58.195
Hey, thanks for reminding me.

47:58.195 --> 47:59.505
I hope Sky's good, too.

47:59.505 --> 48:00.513
- Yo, did you get her number?

48:00.513 --> 48:01.945
- (scoffs) Man, you know I got her number.

48:01.945 --> 48:03.285
- My dog.
- Feel me?

48:03.285 --> 48:05.836
- Get it, bruh.
- Let's do it.

48:05.836 --> 48:08.220
- Man, is that Detective Parkinson?

48:08.220 --> 48:09.062
- I think you're right.

48:09.062 --> 48:11.398
- Hey yo, hold on, man.

48:11.398 --> 48:12.231
Hold on.

48:16.105 --> 48:16.938
What's up, man?

48:16.938 --> 48:17.890
What you doing here?

48:17.890 --> 48:19.559
- I'm not sure why you're here,

48:19.559 --> 48:20.455
but my research is telling me

48:20.455 --> 48:22.334
that this is the address for Tiberon.

48:22.334 --> 48:23.534
So I need both of y'all to suit up.

48:23.534 --> 48:25.287
We gonna go get him tonight.

48:25.287 --> 48:27.588
- Oh, shoot.
- You got the stuff right now?

48:27.588 --> 48:29.255
- Yes, sir.
- Shoot.

48:34.236 --> 48:35.069
- Rookie.

48:38.444 --> 48:40.648
(Velcro ripping)

48:40.648 --> 48:41.481
- Yo.

48:46.665 --> 48:49.415
(Velcro ripping)

48:51.054 --> 48:53.071
Are you sure this going down like this?

48:53.071 --> 48:54.110
You're sure-
- Yes, yes.

48:54.110 --> 48:54.943
Just listen up.

48:54.943 --> 48:56.300
Look, you're gonna take my middle.

48:56.300 --> 48:57.133
You listening?

48:57.133 --> 48:59.383
You take my rear.
- Got you.

49:01.384 --> 49:04.384
(suspenseful music)

49:06.508 --> 49:08.177
- [Detective] Come on
rookie, let's go, we're late.

49:08.177 --> 49:11.177
(suspenseful music)

49:22.668 --> 49:23.886
Clear.

49:23.886 --> 49:26.886
(suspenseful music)

49:30.091 --> 49:31.152
Going to the left.

49:31.152 --> 49:34.152
(suspenseful music)

49:38.984 --> 49:40.984
Clear.
- All clear, here.

49:42.554 --> 49:44.234
We're all clear up in here.

49:44.234 --> 49:45.600
- Where the hell did he go?

49:45.600 --> 49:48.600
(suspenseful music)

49:57.621 --> 50:00.371
(rhythmic music)

50:21.835 --> 50:23.389
- Zack.

50:23.389 --> 50:24.639
- Captain Drew.

50:26.191 --> 50:28.524
- No, I should call you that

50:29.689 --> 50:30.938
because you running around here

50:30.938 --> 50:32.923
doing exactly what you want to do.

50:32.923 --> 50:34.015
You worse than the kids.

50:34.015 --> 50:36.177
I tell you what to do, you don't do it.

50:36.177 --> 50:37.501
I tell you what to do,

50:37.501 --> 50:40.881
and you do exactly what
you're not supposed to do.

50:40.881 --> 50:43.705
You think that badge is going
to get you a free lunch.

50:43.705 --> 50:46.635
- No look, just allow me
to do my job, all right.

50:46.635 --> 50:50.373
Like we came this close
to completing that case.

50:50.373 --> 50:51.613
- We?

50:51.613 --> 50:53.010
Ain't no we!

50:53.010 --> 50:56.107
I still don't know why you
were at that house party.

50:56.107 --> 50:58.176
- Okay, okay, okay, forget
the doing my job bit.

50:58.176 --> 50:59.655
Maybe I was a little bit out of bounds

50:59.655 --> 51:02.259
but I have reasons to
believe that this house

51:02.259 --> 51:06.123
is holding the person who is
in charge of the sex ring.

51:06.123 --> 51:08.413
The house party was a bust.

51:08.413 --> 51:11.370
And you even had a motor
vehicle fraud investigator

51:11.370 --> 51:13.380
making house raids.

51:13.380 --> 51:16.026
- You told me to bring Jaiye.

51:16.026 --> 51:18.118
- Shut the hell up, Parkinson.

51:18.118 --> 51:18.982
What do you think this is?

51:18.982 --> 51:20.944
Why don't we just shut
down the whole city?

51:20.944 --> 51:22.918
What do you think they're
going to say upstairs then?

51:22.918 --> 51:25.353
- Why don't you just try it and find out?

51:25.353 --> 51:27.005
- 'Cause I don't need a DA,

51:27.005 --> 51:29.200
a mayor from two different cities

51:29.200 --> 51:33.056
investigating my department
for faulty police work.

51:33.056 --> 51:35.312
- Faulty police work?

51:35.312 --> 51:36.781
Look Captain Drew,

51:36.781 --> 51:37.886
I don't know what's going on,

51:37.886 --> 51:39.314
but I have evidence to
believe that somebody

51:39.314 --> 51:40.898
doesn't want me to crack this thing.

51:40.898 --> 51:42.968
This means that I-
- It means nothing!

51:42.968 --> 51:45.118
You have nothing.

51:45.118 --> 51:46.232
And you know why?

51:46.232 --> 51:47.982
Because you are done!

51:49.310 --> 51:50.143
- Done?

51:51.597 --> 51:54.047
- Don't make me turn in your badge.

51:54.047 --> 51:54.880
Zachariah.

51:55.937 --> 51:57.312
Do me a favor.

51:57.312 --> 51:58.961
Humor me.

51:58.961 --> 52:01.174
The detective is here for two more days.

52:01.174 --> 52:03.033
Just do what he needs done.

52:03.033 --> 52:05.158
And then for the love of God,

52:05.158 --> 52:07.750
we can discuss your
suspension after he leaves.

52:07.750 --> 52:09.238
What, say what?

52:09.238 --> 52:10.479
- Now, get the hell off my office

52:10.479 --> 52:12.874
before I have you thrown out.

52:12.874 --> 52:15.165
- When they giving out metals for this,

52:15.165 --> 52:16.938
you make sure you leave this part out-

52:16.938 --> 52:18.827
- Get the hell out my office, Zachariah!

52:18.827 --> 52:22.554
If it wasn't for your father
saving my life back in '96,

52:22.554 --> 52:27.141
I'd lock you up myself, if
I didn't kill you first.

52:27.141 --> 52:30.141
(suspenseful music)

52:35.709 --> 52:38.566
- I know that walk anywhere.

52:38.566 --> 52:39.710
Sky!

52:39.710 --> 52:42.710
(suspenseful music)

53:10.664 --> 53:11.497
Sky?

53:12.461 --> 53:15.211
- (sighs) Jaiye?

53:19.289 --> 53:20.512
- Sky, right?

53:20.512 --> 53:22.435
How random, what are you doing here?

53:22.435 --> 53:23.686
- Jaiye, I don't mean to be rude,

53:23.686 --> 53:25.919
but I really need to leave right now.

53:25.919 --> 53:27.107
- You know, if I didn't know any better,

53:27.107 --> 53:29.095
I'd say you were hiding from someone.

53:29.095 --> 53:31.892
(keys dropped on concrete)

53:31.892 --> 53:34.975
(car engine revving)

53:37.858 --> 53:40.448
- Hey, get in the damn car.

53:40.448 --> 53:41.554
- Tiberon's after you?

53:41.554 --> 53:43.036
- Get in the damn car.

53:43.036 --> 53:45.144
- I don't know what the
hell y'all wrapped up in,

53:45.144 --> 53:49.764
when I start shooting,
get your ass in the car.

53:49.764 --> 53:52.347
(guns banging)

53:53.773 --> 53:57.265
(suspenseful music)

53:57.265 --> 54:00.402
(tires screeching)

54:00.402 --> 54:03.402
(suspenseful music)

54:34.004 --> 54:35.485
(gun bangs)

54:35.485 --> 54:37.218
(men murmuring)

54:37.218 --> 54:40.301
(suspenseful music)

54:47.802 --> 54:50.135
(gun bangs)

54:58.184 --> 54:59.319
- Shit.

54:59.319 --> 55:02.732
(suspenseful music)

55:02.732 --> 55:05.815
(car engine revving)

55:08.831 --> 55:11.098
- I just don't understand
why you was at the party.

55:11.098 --> 55:13.473
And where's your girl at?

55:13.473 --> 55:15.256
- Like I said bro, I was just invited.

55:15.256 --> 55:17.284
She knew somebody there.

55:17.284 --> 55:21.662
And this whole thing is just,
it's crazy to me too, bro.

55:21.662 --> 55:23.351
(phone vibrating)
- Okay.

55:23.351 --> 55:24.184
- Hey, hold on a second.

55:24.184 --> 55:25.359
I got a call, man.

55:25.359 --> 55:26.378
It's Jaiye.

55:26.378 --> 55:28.741
Yo Jaiye, what's good, man?

55:28.741 --> 55:29.574
- Hey, listen man.

55:29.574 --> 55:32.006
Hey, they just tried to kill us.

55:32.006 --> 55:33.706
Wait, what?

55:33.706 --> 55:37.371
- Yeah, no, Tiberon and
his goon from the party.

55:37.371 --> 55:38.684
- You talking about with
the girl from the party.

55:38.684 --> 55:41.078
What was her name again, Sky?

55:41.078 --> 55:42.756
- Yeah, I got Sky right now.

55:42.756 --> 55:45.541
- Yo, don't tell me you got Ruth involved?

55:45.541 --> 55:47.357
- They tried to kidnap her.

55:47.357 --> 55:48.660
They saw me.

55:48.660 --> 55:49.920
We had a little chase.

55:49.920 --> 55:50.830
Hey listen, man.

55:50.830 --> 55:51.663
Bring Ruth in.

55:51.663 --> 55:52.930
I think she's in danger, man.

55:52.930 --> 55:53.763
- All right, cool, yo.

55:53.763 --> 55:54.693
First of all, calm down, bro.

55:54.693 --> 55:55.526
You got this, man.

55:55.526 --> 55:57.456
Remember you can do all
things through Christ, man.

55:57.456 --> 55:59.883
- I can do all things through Christ, man.

55:59.883 --> 56:01.950
- We gonna meet you at the spot, okay?

56:01.950 --> 56:03.296
- All right, bet.

56:03.296 --> 56:05.379
- Yo, we gotta roll, man.

56:10.133 --> 56:12.966
(Jaiye murmuring)

56:16.784 --> 56:19.451
(pensive music)

56:26.738 --> 56:30.321
(women faintly chattering)

56:44.999 --> 56:46.825
- [Ruth] Sarah!

56:46.825 --> 56:48.367
- What are you doing here?

56:48.367 --> 56:49.751
- Nothing.

56:49.751 --> 56:50.910
I just wanted to check on you.

56:50.910 --> 56:52.380
I tried calling you.

56:52.380 --> 56:54.814
- Well, here I am bitch, see?

56:54.814 --> 56:56.286
- How are you doing, Sarah?

56:56.286 --> 56:58.120
- Ruth, tell me you wanted to see me

56:58.120 --> 57:00.599
like everything else was
all hunky-dory, okay?

57:00.599 --> 57:01.432
- Sarah.

57:04.737 --> 57:05.570
- What?

57:05.570 --> 57:06.802
- Oh my God, did he do this to you?

57:06.802 --> 57:08.410
- I don't want your sympathy.

57:08.410 --> 57:10.048
I don't want your anything.

57:10.048 --> 57:12.327
Matter of fact, why weren't
you in class tonight?

57:12.327 --> 57:15.662
Why doesn't anybody know
about you, who you are?

57:15.662 --> 57:16.891
Huh?

57:16.891 --> 57:18.826
I'm really pissed off.

57:18.826 --> 57:22.900
You bring cops to my house
to arrest my husband?

57:22.900 --> 57:24.567
You showed out, Ruth.

57:24.567 --> 57:26.428
You showed your mystery ass.

57:26.428 --> 57:29.388
(pensive music)

57:29.388 --> 57:30.221
- Sarah.

57:31.216 --> 57:33.327
- What do you want from me, Ruth?

57:33.327 --> 57:34.713
- I'm gonna make this right.

57:34.713 --> 57:37.348
But I need you to tell me,
did John do this to you?

57:37.348 --> 57:38.955
- You think you can blow into town

57:38.955 --> 57:41.778
and try to make things right
in other people's lives?

57:41.778 --> 57:45.611
Tony gave you an opportunity
and you spat on it.

57:45.611 --> 57:48.361
(pensive music)

58:13.930 --> 58:15.617
- I knew my girl will
lead us right to her.

58:15.617 --> 58:16.666
- Hell, yeah.

58:16.666 --> 58:19.333
(pensive music)

58:23.183 --> 58:25.933
(rhythmic music)

58:37.312 --> 58:40.062
(engine revving)

58:43.589 --> 58:45.160
- Follow her, go, go!

58:45.160 --> 58:46.683
I gotta hold her.

58:46.683 --> 58:51.683
(suspenseful music)
(engines revving)

59:40.659 --> 59:41.909
Get in the car.

59:44.954 --> 59:47.287
I said, get in the damn car.

59:48.210 --> 59:49.165
Hey, hey.

59:49.165 --> 59:51.498
(gun bangs)

59:52.439 --> 59:55.439
(suspenseful music)

59:59.497 --> 1:00:01.135
- You killed...

1:00:01.135 --> 1:00:03.445
(suspenseful music)

1:00:03.445 --> 1:00:07.350
You ain't never killed
nobody before, have you?

1:00:07.350 --> 1:00:09.588
It's different plugging a
bullet in a body, isn't it?

1:00:09.588 --> 1:00:12.588
(suspenseful music)

1:00:14.374 --> 1:00:15.707
Give me the gun.

1:00:17.179 --> 1:00:18.929
It's okay, it's okay.

1:00:21.315 --> 1:00:22.565
Get in the car.

1:00:23.770 --> 1:00:24.979
I'm in charge now.

1:00:24.979 --> 1:00:27.716
(suspenseful music)

1:00:27.716 --> 1:00:30.383
(ominous music)

1:00:38.776 --> 1:00:42.359
(faint background chatter)

1:00:45.138 --> 1:00:47.583
- Zach, I'm gonna ask you one more time?

1:00:47.583 --> 1:00:49.064
Where's you girlfriend?

1:00:49.064 --> 1:00:50.314
- I don't know.

1:00:53.851 --> 1:00:55.964
- Let me help you.

1:00:55.964 --> 1:00:57.359
- Why were you at the exact address

1:00:57.359 --> 1:00:59.219
where John Tiberon lives at?

1:00:59.219 --> 1:01:00.469
- I don't know.

1:01:02.033 --> 1:01:05.141
- Don't think for one second,
that if you were part of this,

1:01:05.141 --> 1:01:06.545
I won't take your ass down.

1:01:06.545 --> 1:01:09.212
(pensive music)

1:01:19.209 --> 1:01:22.042
(shoes scuffling)

1:01:33.131 --> 1:01:35.284
- Detective, Zack.

1:01:35.284 --> 1:01:37.492
- Bro, talk to us, man.

1:01:37.492 --> 1:01:39.360
- We're at the party, vibing.

1:01:39.360 --> 1:01:40.914
Detective, you tell Zack that

1:01:40.914 --> 1:01:42.838
John Tiberon lives at the house.

1:01:42.838 --> 1:01:45.693
Next thing I know, we right in the place.

1:01:45.693 --> 1:01:46.526
- Okay.

1:01:47.385 --> 1:01:50.143
- And that was my first time
even hearing about this man.

1:01:50.143 --> 1:01:51.529
- So you didn't know about John?

1:01:51.529 --> 1:01:52.518
- No.

1:01:52.518 --> 1:01:54.366
- As you remember, we raided the place.

1:01:54.366 --> 1:01:55.500
It was a bust.

1:01:55.500 --> 1:01:57.222
I mean, we couldn't even interview nobody.

1:01:57.222 --> 1:01:59.994
- So what are you doing with
her and why are we here?

1:01:59.994 --> 1:02:01.392
- I'm leaving the bank.

1:02:01.392 --> 1:02:03.674
I go to the parking garage
and I see Sky, here.

1:02:03.674 --> 1:02:05.130
And she's distraught.

1:02:05.130 --> 1:02:06.650
Somebody is chasing her.

1:02:06.650 --> 1:02:08.801
- Wait, wait, you talking
about big dude from the party?

1:02:08.801 --> 1:02:10.051
- John Tiberon?

1:02:11.089 --> 1:02:14.142
- Yeah, I mean he nearly killed us.

1:02:14.142 --> 1:02:16.422
I had to shoot his tires out.

1:02:16.422 --> 1:02:19.589
- So what were you doing at his house?

1:02:21.157 --> 1:02:24.630
- Listen, she wants to know
that if she cooperates,

1:02:24.630 --> 1:02:27.109
she'll be protected.

1:02:27.109 --> 1:02:27.942
- Talk.

1:02:30.282 --> 1:02:31.115
Talk.

1:02:31.951 --> 1:02:35.364
- I've known John Tiberon
for a very long time.

1:02:35.364 --> 1:02:38.197
And he is a ruthless devil.

1:02:38.197 --> 1:02:39.030
- Okay.

1:02:40.866 --> 1:02:42.283
- I work for him.

1:02:43.554 --> 1:02:45.452
- Doing what?

1:02:45.452 --> 1:02:47.250
- She's a sex worker.

1:02:47.250 --> 1:02:48.833
- Boom, we got him.

1:02:49.988 --> 1:02:51.492
- No, we don't have anything.

1:02:51.492 --> 1:02:52.339
We don't have no evidence.

1:02:52.339 --> 1:02:53.528
We ain't got nothing.

1:02:53.528 --> 1:02:55.597
All this means is she's under arrest.

1:02:55.597 --> 1:02:57.347
- No, Zack she's not.

1:02:58.266 --> 1:02:59.909
- John's trying to kill us,

1:02:59.909 --> 1:03:01.538
but Sky knows where he's at.

1:03:01.538 --> 1:03:02.496
She's got some information.

1:03:02.496 --> 1:03:05.467
I know it's going to be
beneficial to the case.

1:03:05.467 --> 1:03:08.239
- 'Cause she knows what he's going.

1:03:08.239 --> 1:03:09.619
- Bingo.

1:03:09.619 --> 1:03:11.072
- And where's he going?

1:03:11.072 --> 1:03:13.905
(rhythmic music)

1:03:18.463 --> 1:03:20.584
- He always said if shit hits the fan,

1:03:20.584 --> 1:03:22.370
that he would get rid of all his girls

1:03:22.370 --> 1:03:24.287
and take off to Mexico.

1:03:25.193 --> 1:03:26.915
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, what you mean,

1:03:26.915 --> 1:03:29.099
get rid of all his girls?

1:03:29.099 --> 1:03:31.837
Sell us to the next trafficker.

1:03:31.837 --> 1:03:33.670
- And how you do that?

1:03:34.581 --> 1:03:35.998
- There's only one place.

1:03:35.998 --> 1:03:37.437
The same place he sells all his girls

1:03:37.437 --> 1:03:40.173
when he's done with them.

1:03:40.173 --> 1:03:41.909
- Where and when?

1:03:41.909 --> 1:03:44.742
(rhythmic music)

1:03:48.315 --> 1:03:51.945
- Look, if we can get them on
camera, making a transaction,

1:03:51.945 --> 1:03:52.862
we got him.

1:03:53.943 --> 1:03:56.337
- Zack this guy's a psychopath.

1:03:56.337 --> 1:03:59.454
He has a vendetta against you.

1:03:59.454 --> 1:04:01.293
We won't be able to get
close enough to tape them,

1:04:01.293 --> 1:04:03.696
so we're gonna have to bring them in.

1:04:03.696 --> 1:04:04.967
- True, true.

1:04:04.967 --> 1:04:08.159
But if we got a body, we got a case.

1:04:08.159 --> 1:04:09.945
And with the amount of
cases he has on him,

1:04:09.945 --> 1:04:12.325
oh, he's going away for a long time.

1:04:12.325 --> 1:04:14.417
- Let's just hope some of
the traffick victim women

1:04:14.417 --> 1:04:15.699
will be willing to testify.

1:04:15.699 --> 1:04:18.449
(Velcro pulling)

1:04:20.463 --> 1:04:23.027
- Oh, by the way, if this thing goes well,

1:04:23.027 --> 1:04:26.955
like you think it will, I owe you one.

1:04:26.955 --> 1:04:29.705
(hands clapping)

1:04:33.462 --> 1:04:37.536
- Yo, I also requested the
opening of Kennedy's file

1:04:37.536 --> 1:04:39.636
the night she escaped from the hospital.

1:04:39.636 --> 1:04:40.726
- Why is that?

1:04:40.726 --> 1:04:42.143
- Think about it.

1:04:43.352 --> 1:04:45.726
She just escaped the hospital undetected

1:04:45.726 --> 1:04:47.342
without a trace.

1:04:47.342 --> 1:04:49.684
Suspect was in at Greyhound
surveillance footage,

1:04:49.684 --> 1:04:52.434
matches everything, but the face.

1:04:53.338 --> 1:04:55.724
- Okay, what are you getting at?

1:04:55.724 --> 1:04:59.974
- I just wonder if plastic
surgery had taken place.

1:05:03.536 --> 1:05:06.834
(Zachariah sighs)

1:05:06.834 --> 1:05:09.501
(pensive music)

1:05:15.842 --> 1:05:18.497
- So it's agreed, we're
bringing in Tiberon on the line?

1:05:18.497 --> 1:05:21.126
- Yeah, we gotta stay stealth,
if it's going to work.

1:05:21.126 --> 1:05:23.655
- All right, if they're
really trafficking women?

1:05:23.655 --> 1:05:24.488
(gun clicks)

1:05:24.488 --> 1:05:25.948
We ain't going out quietly.

1:05:25.948 --> 1:05:29.031
(suspenseful music)

1:05:39.144 --> 1:05:40.900
- So, where the hell is my product?

1:05:40.900 --> 1:05:44.478
- So there's been a little
change in our agreement.

1:05:44.478 --> 1:05:47.183
- Where the hell is Tiberon?

1:05:47.183 --> 1:05:49.675
- Let's just say it's not around anymore.

1:05:49.675 --> 1:05:52.184
You want the product to not?

1:05:52.184 --> 1:05:54.096
- Yeah, well then stop
bullshitting and bring them out.

1:05:54.096 --> 1:05:56.679
(upbeat music)

1:06:03.081 --> 1:06:04.247
What's the hold up?

1:06:04.247 --> 1:06:06.388
- So do we got a deal or not?
- Yeah!

1:06:06.388 --> 1:06:09.388
(suspenseful music)

1:06:22.110 --> 1:06:23.420
- Get out!

1:06:23.420 --> 1:06:26.003
(upbeat music)

1:06:44.353 --> 1:06:45.806
- I guess they'll do.

1:06:45.806 --> 1:06:46.949
(tense music)

1:06:46.949 --> 1:06:49.868
(Zachariah murmuring)

1:06:49.868 --> 1:06:52.535
- It's not what you think it is.

1:06:57.005 --> 1:06:57.963
- Oh shit!
- Cops.

1:06:57.963 --> 1:06:59.802
(suspenseful music)

1:06:59.802 --> 1:07:00.635
- Freeze!

1:07:02.574 --> 1:07:03.496
Don't move a muscle.

1:07:03.496 --> 1:07:05.996
(tense music)

1:07:16.097 --> 1:07:17.578
(rhythmic music)

1:07:17.578 --> 1:07:18.943
- You think you could
do a deal without me?

1:07:18.943 --> 1:07:21.443
(gun banging)

1:07:24.950 --> 1:07:25.783
(Henry yelling)

1:07:25.783 --> 1:07:28.366
(guns banging)

1:07:29.998 --> 1:07:32.339
(rhythmic music)

1:07:32.339 --> 1:07:34.890
(gun banging)

1:07:34.890 --> 1:07:36.886
- I knew you were cops!

1:07:36.886 --> 1:07:38.734
Look, don't die on this hill.

1:07:38.734 --> 1:07:39.952
Just give him my product.

1:07:39.952 --> 1:07:42.086
We can all go home.

1:07:42.086 --> 1:07:43.472
- I got a shot.

1:07:43.472 --> 1:07:44.305
- Nah, I got it.

1:07:44.305 --> 1:07:45.969
(suspenseful music)

1:07:45.969 --> 1:07:48.302
(gun bangs)

1:07:51.314 --> 1:07:53.731
(body thuds)

1:07:56.836 --> 1:07:58.455
Ruth!
- Zack.

1:07:58.455 --> 1:08:00.918
- I'm so sorry, Zack.

1:08:00.918 --> 1:08:02.525
- Ruth, where you going?

1:08:02.525 --> 1:08:03.525
- I'm sorry.

1:08:06.088 --> 1:08:07.948
- Zack, Zack!

1:08:07.948 --> 1:08:09.441
- It's not Ruth, it's Kennedy.

1:08:09.441 --> 1:08:10.819
- Yo, what the hell are
you are talking about?

1:08:10.819 --> 1:08:12.740
- I don't know, but we'll figure it out.

1:08:12.740 --> 1:08:14.660
(phone ringing)

1:08:14.660 --> 1:08:16.424
- PJ, hello?
- Hello?

1:08:16.424 --> 1:08:17.363
- PJ!

1:08:17.363 --> 1:08:20.807
- Fellas, fellas, lower your weapons.

1:08:20.807 --> 1:08:23.262
- You're out of line, man.

1:08:23.262 --> 1:08:24.522
- I don't know, but we'll figure it out.

1:08:24.522 --> 1:08:26.179
- You were out of line.
- We'll figure it out, man.

1:08:26.179 --> 1:08:29.179
(Zachariah panting)

1:08:32.902 --> 1:08:34.769
- Yes, I escaped!
- Good.

1:08:34.769 --> 1:08:36.304
- I'm gonna dump this car.

1:08:36.304 --> 1:08:38.637
- Send your location.
- Okay.

1:08:40.730 --> 1:08:43.897
(slow rhythmic music)

1:09:17.450 --> 1:09:18.752
- [PJ] Kennedy, come here.

1:09:18.752 --> 1:09:19.835
- I'm coming.

1:09:34.753 --> 1:09:37.002
- It's all there, you can count it.

1:09:37.002 --> 1:09:37.915
- There's no need.

1:09:37.915 --> 1:09:39.572
You've done more than enough for me.

1:09:39.572 --> 1:09:41.239
Why did you help me?

1:09:44.603 --> 1:09:47.124
- Kennedy, that night I
met you at the hospital,

1:09:47.124 --> 1:09:49.568
I knew you were alive for a reason.

1:09:49.568 --> 1:09:51.458
And then, when I saw you running

1:09:51.458 --> 1:09:54.523
behind the alley in the
hospital, it confirmed it.

1:09:54.523 --> 1:09:56.678
Now the question is, are you okay?

1:09:56.678 --> 1:09:58.713
- I'm over all of this, PJ.

1:09:58.713 --> 1:10:00.931
I lied to the only man I ever loved.

1:10:00.931 --> 1:10:02.779
I lost a friendship.

1:10:02.779 --> 1:10:04.994
And I have this new face.

1:10:04.994 --> 1:10:07.819
I haven't been okay
for the last two years.

1:10:07.819 --> 1:10:09.286
I don't even know if the plan worked

1:10:09.286 --> 1:10:11.649
or if it was even worth it.

1:10:11.649 --> 1:10:14.040
- I worked on the Atlanta
police force for 10 years.

1:10:14.040 --> 1:10:15.787
And I don't have shit to show for it.

1:10:15.787 --> 1:10:17.266
My wife needs a new car.

1:10:17.266 --> 1:10:18.495
My house isn't paid off.

1:10:18.495 --> 1:10:20.102
I never even got a raise.

1:10:20.102 --> 1:10:23.367
I saw an opportunity and I took it.

1:10:23.367 --> 1:10:26.444
- That's what you're
doing with your money?

1:10:26.444 --> 1:10:29.184
- If I were you, I'd
say my goodbyes to Zack.

1:10:29.184 --> 1:10:31.412
Phoenix PD is going to close this case.

1:10:31.412 --> 1:10:34.015
You just have to get okay
with saying goodbye to him.

1:10:34.015 --> 1:10:36.284
- I'm sure he'll be
grateful to both of us,

1:10:36.284 --> 1:10:38.865
for all the information we helped him get.

1:10:38.865 --> 1:10:40.136
- Everything worked out.

1:10:40.136 --> 1:10:41.755
We all got paid.

1:10:41.755 --> 1:10:44.462
Your motorcycle bike is
about four blocks up.

1:10:44.462 --> 1:10:46.688
This'll be the last time
we talk to each other.

1:10:46.688 --> 1:10:48.746
- Well, thank you, PJ.

1:10:48.746 --> 1:10:49.996
For everything.

1:10:51.602 --> 1:10:56.519
(trunk slams)
(soft music)

1:11:00.980 --> 1:11:03.847
(engine revs)

1:11:03.847 --> 1:11:06.597
(rhythmic music)

1:11:18.264 --> 1:11:20.582
- DA Briona May, thank you.

1:11:20.582 --> 1:11:23.744
Your detective helped us solve
the human trafficking case.

1:11:23.744 --> 1:11:26.840
- No captain, the pleasure is all mine.

1:11:26.840 --> 1:11:28.921
We were just there to support.

1:11:28.921 --> 1:11:33.224
Oh, and the little matter that
the detective was there for,

1:11:33.224 --> 1:11:35.057
is no longer a factor.

1:11:36.038 --> 1:11:37.121
- You got it.

1:11:38.150 --> 1:11:40.483
- Detective, you are a hero.

1:11:41.530 --> 1:11:43.033
And the City of Atlanta

1:11:43.033 --> 1:11:45.740
has chartered you a flight back home.

1:11:45.740 --> 1:11:46.968
- Thank you, ma'am.

1:11:46.968 --> 1:11:48.619
I'll see you later this week.

1:11:48.619 --> 1:11:50.498
- Absolutely.

1:11:50.498 --> 1:11:53.445
That cold case is now closed.

1:11:53.445 --> 1:11:54.362
Great work.

1:11:56.713 --> 1:11:58.191
(phone slams)

1:11:58.191 --> 1:12:00.931
(phone vibrating)

1:12:00.931 --> 1:12:01.764
- Hello?

1:12:02.946 --> 1:12:05.175
No, thank you Detective Austin.

1:12:05.175 --> 1:12:07.149
I learned from the best.

1:12:07.149 --> 1:12:08.263
See you later.

1:12:08.263 --> 1:12:11.096
(slow jazz music)

1:12:31.866 --> 1:12:33.000
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:35.173
- So what happened to
your wrist right here?

1:12:35.173 --> 1:12:37.156
- I fell and I cut myself.

1:12:37.156 --> 1:12:40.526
- Yeah, you just fell
down, just walking or?

1:12:40.526 --> 1:12:41.526
Was you doing something?

1:12:41.526 --> 1:12:42.359
- It's a long story.

1:12:42.359 --> 1:12:43.195
We don't have to talk about it.

1:12:43.195 --> 1:12:45.580
I don't wanna talk
about. (faintly talking)

1:12:45.580 --> 1:12:48.909
- (laughs) Bet.

1:12:48.909 --> 1:12:50.181
I could put you on...

1:12:50.181 --> 1:12:52.681
(jazzy music)

1:12:55.113 --> 1:12:57.863
(light knocking)

1:12:58.967 --> 1:13:00.261
- You know, that might be the pizza guy.

1:13:00.261 --> 1:13:01.392
Hey, yo, hold the movie for a second.

1:13:01.392 --> 1:13:04.642
I'm coming right back.
- All right, bet.

1:13:06.088 --> 1:13:08.921
(Zachariah sighs)

1:13:14.844 --> 1:13:15.677
- Tell me why in the hell

1:13:15.677 --> 1:13:19.766
I shouldn't arrest your
ass right here and now?

1:13:19.766 --> 1:13:21.365
- I have no words for you, Zachariah.

1:13:21.365 --> 1:13:23.115
- No words, no words?

1:13:24.095 --> 1:13:28.428
You know what Ru, Kennedy,
whoever the hell you are?

1:13:30.908 --> 1:13:32.568
- Hey, Ruth.

1:13:32.568 --> 1:13:34.217
- Hey, Sky.

1:13:34.217 --> 1:13:35.884
- Girl, come on now.

1:13:37.409 --> 1:13:38.909
- I love you Zack.

1:13:40.043 --> 1:13:42.511
I've loved you since
the day that I met you.

1:13:42.511 --> 1:13:46.698
You're the kindest man
that I've ever been with.

1:13:46.698 --> 1:13:47.980
Zack you wouldn't like me

1:13:47.980 --> 1:13:50.667
if you knew the person that I used to be,

1:13:50.667 --> 1:13:52.719
but you taught me what a
real friend looks like,

1:13:52.719 --> 1:13:54.534
what a real man looks like.

1:13:54.534 --> 1:13:55.786
And I messed that up.

1:13:55.786 --> 1:13:56.703
I get that.

1:14:01.208 --> 1:14:04.264
- Who was helping me with
information in regards to my case?

1:14:04.264 --> 1:14:05.097
- I was.

1:14:07.089 --> 1:14:09.032
- Who the hell are you?

1:14:09.032 --> 1:14:10.949
Who gave you the right?

1:14:15.122 --> 1:14:17.022
You think you could just
become this murderer

1:14:17.022 --> 1:14:18.944
and fix a brand new life?

1:14:18.944 --> 1:14:20.371
You think you could turn a noxious mess

1:14:20.371 --> 1:14:23.248
into a life of righteousness?

1:14:23.248 --> 1:14:24.081
Nah, nah.

1:14:24.081 --> 1:14:27.805
What you thought was God
was using you, I bet, huh?

1:14:27.805 --> 1:14:29.792
Just become a vigilante
and help law enforcement

1:14:29.792 --> 1:14:31.959
and it all goes away, huh?

1:14:33.148 --> 1:14:33.981
- I just want to-

1:14:33.981 --> 1:14:36.299
- No, no, no, no, no!

1:14:36.299 --> 1:14:40.966
There are still actions and
practices in place, Kennedy.

1:14:42.963 --> 1:14:47.130
And this ain't how you
show that you love someone.

1:14:48.064 --> 1:14:50.227
- Well, if you ever want to talk,

1:14:50.227 --> 1:14:52.592
my WhatsApp will always be active.

1:14:52.592 --> 1:14:54.882
- (scoffs) WhatsApp?

1:14:54.882 --> 1:14:56.341
You know that's encrypted, right?

1:14:56.341 --> 1:14:58.651
You know you real smart.

1:14:58.651 --> 1:14:59.670
I tell you what we're going to do.

1:14:59.670 --> 1:15:01.454
Nah, I tell you what you going to do.

1:15:01.454 --> 1:15:02.977
You got 10 minutes to
get the hell up out here

1:15:02.977 --> 1:15:04.772
before I called Detective Parkinson.

1:15:04.772 --> 1:15:06.976
Call your dad or whatever.

1:15:06.976 --> 1:15:08.563
It was nice knowing you.

1:15:08.563 --> 1:15:11.198
(door slams)

1:15:11.198 --> 1:15:13.948
(rhythmic music)

1:15:22.812 --> 1:15:27.431
- [Ruth] Of all the things
that I've seen in my life,

1:15:27.431 --> 1:15:31.348
one thing that I've never
seen much of is love.

1:15:32.881 --> 1:15:37.448
The fact that I found love
in someone who trusted me

1:15:37.448 --> 1:15:41.712
and I ruined that love,
will hurt me forever.

1:15:41.712 --> 1:15:43.328
The hurt that I've created

1:15:43.328 --> 1:15:47.024
cannot be simply expunged by good deeds.

1:15:47.024 --> 1:15:48.894
I know that now.

1:15:48.894 --> 1:15:51.224
I will do better now.

1:15:51.224 --> 1:15:54.469
I want to dedicate my
life to the higher power

1:15:54.469 --> 1:15:56.642
and elevate my thinking.

1:15:56.642 --> 1:15:58.668
I want to love those that love me

1:15:58.668 --> 1:16:02.172
and always remember
that Romans 12:19 says,

1:16:02.172 --> 1:16:04.496
vengeance is mine, says the Lord.

1:16:04.496 --> 1:16:05.579
I will repay.

1:16:06.492 --> 1:16:10.410
I want to use this third chance
to be better than I've been.

1:16:10.410 --> 1:16:12.160
And most importantly,

1:16:13.602 --> 1:16:14.825
look within.
