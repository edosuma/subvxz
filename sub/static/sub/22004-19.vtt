WEBVTT

00:17.104 --> 00:20.063
Anyone doesn't make the light
gets the Captain's Mast.

00:20.107 --> 00:21.108
Let's go!

00:48.135 --> 00:49.136
Oh...

00:52.400 --> 00:55.098
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom

00:55.142 --> 00:57.622
♪ Bang, bang, bang, bang

00:57.666 --> 01:00.234
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:00.277 --> 01:01.452
♪ How, how, how, how

01:01.496 --> 01:03.933
♪ Hey, hey

01:09.721 --> 01:11.158
♪ You gotta come on.

01:13.290 --> 01:15.118
You knew Percy took that
meeting with the FBI

01:15.162 --> 01:16.598
before anybody else did.

01:16.641 --> 01:18.730
That doesn't mean I know whether
she took the job or not.

01:18.774 --> 01:20.341
How could you not know?

01:20.384 --> 01:22.212
I mean, y-you're roommates, and
plus, it's been a week...

01:22.256 --> 01:24.258
Lasalle, look, I wish I knew,
but I don't, all right?

01:24.301 --> 01:25.476
I'm a freaking mess.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.739
I don't want her to leave.Neither do I.

01:27.783 --> 01:30.220
So, but we want her to do
what's best for her, right?

01:30.264 --> 01:33.136
Yeah, of course.All right, so,
let's just

01:33.180 --> 01:35.312
let it play out, give her
whatever space she needs

01:35.356 --> 01:37.097
and hope that she stays.

01:37.140 --> 01:39.273
Okay, I know you're right,

01:39.316 --> 01:41.927
but, like, deep down,
what does your gut tell you?

01:41.971 --> 01:43.451
I think she's leaving.

01:43.494 --> 01:45.322
PRIDE: I just want you to know
that whatever you decide

01:45.366 --> 01:48.673
is fine with me. All right.

01:48.717 --> 01:50.936
See you soon. Morning.Is that Sonja?

01:50.980 --> 01:52.416
Did she make a decision?

01:52.460 --> 01:54.723
No, Laurel. She's coming to town
for the long weekend.

01:54.766 --> 01:56.159
We're gonna go
apartment hunting.

01:56.203 --> 01:57.465
Oh. I mean...

01:57.508 --> 01:59.249
That's great,
she's graduating college soon,

01:59.293 --> 02:01.338
she's moving back;
you must be so excited.

02:01.382 --> 02:02.339
Yeah, I am.
Yeah.

02:02.383 --> 02:03.862
Four years is
a long time.

02:03.906 --> 02:05.777
I'm looking forward to having
her back in town again.

02:05.821 --> 02:07.344
I missed her.

02:07.388 --> 02:10.434
I'm still mad at her for, uh,
choosing LSU over Alabama.

02:10.478 --> 02:12.219
Roll Tide.

02:12.262 --> 02:14.177
She's into music, not football.

02:14.221 --> 02:16.266
Promised I wouldn't hold
that against her.

02:18.399 --> 02:23.230
Look, I know we're all
on edge about Sonja, okay?

02:23.273 --> 02:26.015
We've been a family.

02:26.058 --> 02:28.191
No doubt it'll leave a big hole
if she takes the job.

02:28.235 --> 02:30.541
You think she's leaving, too,
don't you?

02:30.585 --> 02:33.414
I think that... it's up to her.

02:33.457 --> 02:36.373
I told Sonja to take
as much time as she needed

02:36.417 --> 02:38.027
to think it through.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.684
In the meantime,
with or without her,

02:42.727 --> 02:44.120
looks like
we got a case.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.600
So let's roll...

02:45.643 --> 02:48.255
tide.

02:48.298 --> 02:49.647
All right, I have
a better idea.

02:49.691 --> 02:51.214
Why don't you let us
do the rolling

02:51.258 --> 02:52.563
and you do the dad thing.

02:52.607 --> 02:55.087
Tell Laurel
we said hi.

03:03.226 --> 03:05.881
LASALLE: Looks like we're lucky
this is our only victim.

03:05.924 --> 03:07.404
Morning, Miss Loretta.

03:07.448 --> 03:08.797
Yeah, a better morning
for the cyclists

03:08.840 --> 03:10.451
than Yeoman Bennett here.

03:10.494 --> 03:12.931
Yeah, Navy Cycling Club on
their Saturday morning ride,

03:12.975 --> 03:14.977
nearly got mowed down
when the truck driver

03:15.020 --> 03:16.239
ran the red.

03:16.283 --> 03:17.719
The victim was inside
one of the barrels

03:17.762 --> 03:19.764
that fell off the truck
when the driver tried to swerve

03:19.808 --> 03:21.113
to avoid the cyclists.

03:21.157 --> 03:22.593
Might never have found
the body if he hadn't.

03:22.637 --> 03:24.247
That means whoever
put him in there

03:24.291 --> 03:25.683
obviously didn't
want him found.

03:25.727 --> 03:28.164
Any idea what
cause of death is?

03:28.208 --> 03:30.340
It's a single gunshot wound
to the back of the head,

03:30.384 --> 03:32.255
fired at point-blank range.

03:32.299 --> 03:33.952
But no exit wound?

03:33.996 --> 03:36.390
No. I'm thinking the shooter
used fragmentation ammo.

03:36.433 --> 03:37.695
If so, the bullet
would've disintegrated

03:37.739 --> 03:39.349
the moment it entered the skull.

03:39.393 --> 03:42.265
Maximum damage, no ballistics.
Sounds like a professional hit.

03:42.309 --> 03:45.964
All right, what do we know
about this Yeoman Bennett?

03:46.008 --> 03:47.966
It looks like Bennett
was an office manager

03:48.010 --> 03:49.229
at the Naval Research Lab

03:49.272 --> 03:50.534
out at Stennis.

03:50.578 --> 03:51.927
Clean record and the
prelim background check

03:51.970 --> 03:53.189
didn't show anything suspicious,

03:53.233 --> 03:55.626
but I got a call out to his C.O.

03:55.670 --> 03:58.238
What?
What?

04:00.109 --> 04:01.676
What do you mean what?
What're you doing here?

04:01.719 --> 04:03.417
Well, I got the group text.
I was close by.

04:03.460 --> 04:05.027
I thought I'd get
a jump on things...GREGORIO: Oh, stop.

04:05.070 --> 04:06.855
Don't play dumb. You know
what he's talking about.

04:06.898 --> 04:08.900
You've been M.I.A. for days; we
thought you took that FBI job.

04:08.944 --> 04:10.859
Yeah, does this mean you didn't?

04:10.902 --> 04:14.297
Yeah, I called them this morning
and I turned it down.

04:14.341 --> 04:17.431
I'm staying.
Oh. You sure?

04:17.474 --> 04:19.520
A girl's allowed
to change her mind, isn't she?

04:19.563 --> 04:22.305
Does King know about it?Yeah, I just called him.

04:22.349 --> 04:24.525
WADE: I'm sure he also
wants to know who killed

04:24.568 --> 04:26.440
Yeoman Bennett and why.

04:26.483 --> 04:28.964
Right. Sebastian, any chance
you could put

04:29.007 --> 04:31.183
the bullet back together
and do forensics on it?

04:31.227 --> 04:32.968
Yeah, well, fragment bullets
are designed to shatter

04:33.011 --> 04:34.709
into hundreds
of pieces, but...

04:34.752 --> 04:36.754
could use the 3-D scanner,
sort of piece it together

04:36.798 --> 04:38.321
like a digital
jigsaw puzzle.

04:38.365 --> 04:39.670
All right,
do what you can.

04:39.714 --> 04:42.630
Gregorio, head to Stennis,
talk to Bennett's C.O.,

04:42.673 --> 04:43.761
see if you can figure out

04:43.805 --> 04:46.068
why he might be targeted.Yep.

04:46.111 --> 04:48.505
Percy and I'll head over
and check out his apartment.

04:48.549 --> 04:50.986
City Mouse and Country Mouse,
together again.

04:56.034 --> 04:58.994
Thought you'd be happy
knowing Percy's not leaving.

04:59.037 --> 05:01.518
I am, believe me.

05:01.562 --> 05:04.739
I just hope it's
for the right reasons.

05:04.782 --> 05:06.480
PRIDE:
I really don't mind

05:06.523 --> 05:08.395
setting you up in a hotel
if you'd rather,

05:08.438 --> 05:10.614
or I can sleep on the rollaway.

05:10.658 --> 05:12.660
Dad, I'm telling you, I'm fine.

05:12.703 --> 05:14.792
Although, I think I'm gonna
keep my stuff out here

05:14.836 --> 05:16.838
'cause there's not much room
in the bathroom.

05:16.881 --> 05:19.362
Tight quarters, I know.
I don't spend much time here.

05:19.406 --> 05:22.278
I'm usually either
working or at the bar.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.280
Yeah, well maybe you
ought to be the one

05:24.324 --> 05:25.455
looking for an apartment.

05:25.499 --> 05:26.804
I mean, it's a little weird

05:26.848 --> 05:28.371
you still living
above your office, isn't it?

05:28.415 --> 05:29.590
I think we're here

05:29.633 --> 05:31.287
to talk about where
you're gonna live,

05:31.331 --> 05:34.246
not me.
Grab an end.

05:34.290 --> 05:38.512
Can't believe you're graduating
in a couple of months.

05:38.555 --> 05:40.514
Time flies.

05:40.557 --> 05:42.820
I know, especially
when all you do is work.

05:42.864 --> 05:45.257
Just saying,
it'll be good

05:45.301 --> 05:46.868
for both of us
when I move back home.

05:46.911 --> 05:48.609
After all, somebody's
got to take care of you.

05:48.652 --> 05:50.088
Have you lost weight?

05:50.132 --> 05:53.265
All right, I'll be the parent
here, if you don't mind.

05:53.309 --> 05:55.485
You look at the listings yet
that I sent you?

05:55.529 --> 05:59.402
I organized them by
affordability and crime rates.

05:59.446 --> 06:01.361
Which, by the way,
cracked me up.

06:01.404 --> 06:03.101
Don't worry, I printed them out.

06:03.145 --> 06:04.712
I've got five apartments
to look at today.

06:04.755 --> 06:06.322
That's my girl.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.150
Ooh, and I knew you'd
be looking for work,

06:08.193 --> 06:10.500
so I called my friend Angie--
I don't know if you

06:10.544 --> 06:12.763
remember her or not--
but she promotes musical acts

06:12.807 --> 06:14.678
at local clubs.

06:14.722 --> 06:17.159
Thought maybe we could meet her
tonight at the bar.

06:18.682 --> 06:20.336
Unless you don't want to.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.425
Oh, no, don't-don't be silly.
That sounds great.

06:25.472 --> 06:27.735
I remember that look
all too well.

06:27.778 --> 06:30.564
You go save the day,
I'll pound the pavement

06:30.607 --> 06:33.567
and we'll meet tonight, okay?
Love you, Daddy.

06:33.610 --> 06:34.742
I love you, too.

06:40.791 --> 06:42.532
I'm back!

06:42.576 --> 06:45.143
Good to have you back, Sonja,
but like I said on the phone,

06:45.187 --> 06:47.624
I need you to be sure, focused.

06:47.668 --> 06:49.234
I'm sure.

06:49.278 --> 06:51.628
I won't let you down, I promise.

06:51.672 --> 06:53.543
All right,
catch me up.

06:53.587 --> 06:55.589
What have you learned
about Yeoman Bennett?

06:55.632 --> 06:57.199
Well, turns out

06:57.242 --> 06:59.984
Bennett was a bit of a gambler,
played poker--

07:00.028 --> 07:02.378
a lot of poker
according to his roommate.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.814
Yeah, in fact,
two nights ago, apparently,

07:03.858 --> 07:05.642
Bennett was up late playing
at Treasure Chest.

07:05.686 --> 07:07.731
Riverboat casino.Right, and the
roommate said he was

07:07.775 --> 07:09.516
winning big, too.
Got himself invited

07:09.559 --> 07:11.735
to a private, high stakes game
somewhere else.

07:11.779 --> 07:16.044
Roommate also said Bennett left
for the game, never came back.

07:16.087 --> 07:17.959
He know where the game was?Not a clue.

07:18.002 --> 07:19.526
PATTON: Yeah, well,
I may have a clue.

07:19.569 --> 07:21.397
Didn't take much deep diving
to find out

07:21.441 --> 07:23.704
that Bennett emptied his
savings account yesterday,

07:23.747 --> 07:25.532
took out 45 large.

07:25.575 --> 07:27.577
Whoa, that's a lot of dough
for a sailor.

07:27.621 --> 07:28.796
Pretty good motive for murder.

07:28.839 --> 07:29.536
LASALLE: Yeah, but still,
it's chump change

07:29.579 --> 07:31.189
for a high-end game.

07:31.233 --> 07:33.365
PRIDE: Bennett was the target
of a professional hit, right?

07:33.409 --> 07:36.107
Got to be more to this
than just 45 grand.

07:36.151 --> 07:37.935
GREGORIO: Bennett's C.O.
said he was a regular

07:37.979 --> 07:39.763
at the Treasure Chest,
so I got the casino

07:39.807 --> 07:41.504
to let me check out
surveillance.

07:41.548 --> 07:42.984
That's Bennett,
two nights ago,

07:43.027 --> 07:44.376
playing poker
for a couple of hours

07:44.420 --> 07:45.639
until that
woman showed up.

07:45.682 --> 07:48.076
She stayed, watched him
win hand after hand,

07:48.119 --> 07:51.079
then whispered in his ear
and led him away.

07:51.122 --> 07:52.646
We need to figure out
who she is.

07:52.689 --> 07:54.517
Patton, can you run
facial recognition?

07:54.561 --> 07:57.085
No need. That's the Dragon Lady.

07:57.128 --> 07:58.608
Wait, what?
You know her?

07:58.652 --> 08:00.523
Know her? She's a regular
at the Treasure Chest,

08:00.567 --> 08:02.090
just like Bennett.

08:02.133 --> 08:04.309
I heard a lot about her at my
Gamblers Anonymous meetings.

08:04.353 --> 08:06.181
Mostly in testimonies by newbies

08:06.224 --> 08:08.226
who lost a lot of money
at her games.

08:08.270 --> 08:10.098
What do you mean
she's a recruiter?

08:10.141 --> 08:12.274
She get high rollers to come
to these underground games,

08:12.317 --> 08:14.406
where the stakes
can get as high as six figures.

08:14.450 --> 08:17.453
Dangerous, though, lot of
organized crime types.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.673
You could definitely lose
a lot more than just your money.

08:19.716 --> 08:21.239
We got to find a game

08:21.283 --> 08:22.980
if we're gonna solve
Yeoman Bennett's murder.

08:23.024 --> 08:25.243
The only problem is,
she's the only way in,

08:25.287 --> 08:26.854
and nobody know
who she is.

08:26.897 --> 08:29.552
You got to get her attention,
get an invite,

08:29.596 --> 08:31.641
but you got to be a hell
of a poker player to do that.

08:31.685 --> 08:33.687
Forget it, Patton, there's no
way I'd ever ask you

08:33.730 --> 08:36.559
to step foot...Pride, I am not
talking about me.

08:36.603 --> 08:40.520
Percy. She played the Southern
circuit for almost a year

08:40.563 --> 08:42.609
on an ATF
undercover deal,

08:42.652 --> 08:45.437
brought down a big-time
arms dealer.

08:45.481 --> 08:48.136
Well, he did bite his lip
every time he bluffed.

08:48.179 --> 08:49.354
Think you can get
the Dragon Lady's attention?

08:49.398 --> 08:51.269
Not without a stake.

08:51.313 --> 08:52.749
The most our comptroller
will authorize

08:52.793 --> 08:54.490
is $10,000. Is that enough?

08:54.534 --> 08:56.274
Gonna need to win big
if you gonna have any chance

08:56.318 --> 08:57.798
of getting her to target you.

08:57.841 --> 09:01.715
I didn't decide to stay just
to stand on the sidelines.

09:01.758 --> 09:03.107
Bring it on.

09:03.151 --> 09:05.022
Don't get too cocky.

09:05.066 --> 09:06.937
All right, the last person
that lady recruited

09:06.981 --> 09:09.418
is laying on
Miss Loretta's table.

09:13.161 --> 09:16.773
Now, how many times are you
gonna keep bluffing me, huh?

09:16.817 --> 09:18.819
Now, I cannot figure out
if you are that good,

09:18.862 --> 09:20.211
or just that lucky.

09:20.255 --> 09:23.650
Ooh. Why don't we
up the ante and see?

09:25.303 --> 09:26.391
Table's limit's 500.

09:26.435 --> 09:28.742
So? Hey.

09:28.785 --> 09:30.047
Y'all want to see a real game?

09:30.091 --> 09:32.833
SONJA: Come on.

09:32.876 --> 09:35.357
You're already up 15 grand.
All right, why don't you, uh,

09:35.400 --> 09:37.925
just take it slow.Relax, Lasalle.

09:37.968 --> 09:39.666
I'm playing with a bunch
of amateurs.

09:39.709 --> 09:42.277
I got this.I understand, but, uh,

09:42.320 --> 09:43.452
you keep betting like that,

09:43.495 --> 09:44.758
you're gonna lose
sooner or later,

09:44.801 --> 09:46.629
and it's gonna lose
any chance we got of...

09:46.673 --> 09:48.196
GREGORIO :
Dragon Lady's heading your way.

09:50.546 --> 09:53.288
Guess you caught her attention.

09:53.331 --> 09:55.638
You were saying?

09:58.902 --> 10:01.339
Are we doing this or what?

10:02.776 --> 10:04.865
1,000.
DEALER: Who's in?

10:08.695 --> 10:10.087
I'm in.

10:10.131 --> 10:12.089
I'm in.

10:26.582 --> 10:28.671
SONJA:
1,000.

10:28.715 --> 10:30.281
I'll call.Fold.

10:30.325 --> 10:32.327
I call.

10:32.370 --> 10:33.633
MAN:
I fold.

10:42.380 --> 10:43.512
5,000.

10:44.731 --> 10:45.688
Percy...

10:45.732 --> 10:47.690
MAN:
Fold.

10:50.084 --> 10:52.086
I call.

10:57.961 --> 10:59.397
Jack of diamonds.

11:08.450 --> 11:10.104
All in.

11:11.627 --> 11:12.759
Percy, she just
got here.

11:12.802 --> 11:15.370
Relax.
I know what I'm doing.

11:15.413 --> 11:16.893
He's gonna fold.

11:16.937 --> 11:18.590
DEALER:
That's 18,000 to you.

11:18.634 --> 11:20.984
I call.

11:21.028 --> 11:23.900
DEALER: River, ten of clubs.MAN: Show me your cards, lady.

11:24.814 --> 11:26.250
Three jacks.

11:27.687 --> 11:28.818
Read 'em and weep.

11:32.822 --> 11:33.997
That's a flush.

11:34.041 --> 11:35.738
Club flush wins.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.000
Wait, what?

11:41.657 --> 11:43.137
Well, I guess I was not
bluffing that time.

11:43.180 --> 11:44.616
Was I?

11:48.403 --> 11:50.361
Gregorio, do you see her?
Where'd she go?I don't know, I lost her.

11:50.405 --> 11:51.754
All right, well,
go look for her.

11:51.798 --> 11:53.147
She may have
went outside.

11:53.190 --> 11:55.192
Hey, Percy, come here.

11:59.631 --> 12:00.676
We lost her.

12:00.720 --> 12:04.724
No. I lost her.

12:16.083 --> 12:17.301
Morning.
LASALLE:
Morning.

12:17.345 --> 12:18.825
You hungry?

12:18.868 --> 12:20.783
Nah, I'm good.

12:20.827 --> 12:22.698
Any idea how Sonja's doing?

12:22.742 --> 12:23.917
I tried calling
her earlier.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.440
She didn't answer.
I think she feels bad

12:25.483 --> 12:26.658
about what happened
last night.

12:27.834 --> 12:29.618
Morning, Daddy.

12:29.661 --> 12:31.794
Good morning, sweetheart.
Hang on just a second.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.753
Let me know when
she gets here, okay?

12:33.796 --> 12:35.450
And keep trying to find
the Dragon Lady.

12:35.493 --> 12:37.800
Copy that. Hey, Laurel

12:37.844 --> 12:40.237
Dragon Lady?

12:40.281 --> 12:42.109
Either you're dating
someone I do not

12:42.152 --> 12:43.850
want to know about,
or that's what kept you

12:43.893 --> 12:45.068
from meeting me last night?

12:45.112 --> 12:46.853
Just a case.

12:46.896 --> 12:49.072
Made your favorite.

12:49.116 --> 12:52.467
French toast, pain perdu,
extra cinnamon.

12:52.510 --> 12:54.556
I don't think I've had that
since I was, like, 12.

12:54.599 --> 12:56.601
Oh...

12:56.645 --> 12:58.995
Sorry. I-I can make
something else.

12:59.039 --> 13:00.431
Oh, no, thanks.
Actually,

13:00.475 --> 13:01.781
I'm meeting a friend
for breakfast.

13:01.824 --> 13:04.609
And then, more
apartment hunting.

13:04.653 --> 13:06.698
Anything look promising?Not yet.

13:06.742 --> 13:08.091
But, you know, I'm picky.

13:08.135 --> 13:09.484
How 'bout Angie?

13:09.527 --> 13:11.834
Any job opportunities
sound good to you last night?

13:11.878 --> 13:14.794
I don't know. Maybe.

13:14.837 --> 13:16.752
But, I got to go.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.798
Um, I'll call you later.Okay. Bye-bye.

13:38.339 --> 13:42.996
I am so... sorry.

13:43.039 --> 13:46.869
You know, I was sure
I had that hand won.

13:46.913 --> 13:49.045
I honestly don't know
what happened.

13:49.089 --> 13:52.005
Nothing's sure about gambling.
You know that.

13:52.048 --> 13:54.616
You made a choice.
It just didn't work out.

13:54.659 --> 13:56.792
Yeah, except it was a choice
that let everyone down.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.620
And you got to know
that's the...

13:58.663 --> 14:00.491
that's the last thing
I'd ever want to do.

14:00.535 --> 14:02.754
That's not why you decided
to stay, is it?

14:02.798 --> 14:04.756
Afraid to let us down?
What?

14:04.800 --> 14:06.933
No. No.

14:06.976 --> 14:08.369
Of course not.

14:08.412 --> 14:10.588
Okay. Good.

14:12.155 --> 14:15.332
Um, how much trouble
are we in

14:15.376 --> 14:16.768
for losing HQ's money?

14:16.812 --> 14:19.771
Well, not as much
as we'll be in

14:19.815 --> 14:21.556
if it doesn't lead
to a conviction.

14:21.599 --> 14:23.906
Come on.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.865
Let's go fix this.

14:28.693 --> 14:30.521
LASALLE:
Finally got an I.D.

14:30.565 --> 14:31.696
on our Dragon Lady, King.

14:31.740 --> 14:33.394
Gregorio snagged the glass

14:33.437 --> 14:35.787
she was drinking from
last night-- got a print.

14:35.831 --> 14:37.920
From the criminal
database?
No.

14:37.964 --> 14:40.314
Actually, from the Office
of Motor Vehicles.

14:40.357 --> 14:42.882
Her real name is
Amy Collins.

14:42.925 --> 14:45.232
Lives in Little Woods
with her eight-year-old son.

14:45.275 --> 14:46.755
Soccer mom by day,

14:46.798 --> 14:48.409
Dragon Lady by night.

14:48.452 --> 14:49.932
Are you sure?Yep.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.891
And it looks like
she goes out of her way

14:51.934 --> 14:53.980
to make sure nobody knows
she lives a double life, too.

14:54.023 --> 14:55.982
That's why she was
so hard to find.

14:56.025 --> 14:57.853
Yeah, but now that we've
found her, we've got leverage.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.116
Yeah, all right, well,
you and Chris go pick her up.

15:00.160 --> 15:03.119
Threaten to arrest her
for accessory to murder

15:03.163 --> 15:04.642
unless she gives up

15:04.686 --> 15:05.730
that private game.

15:05.774 --> 15:07.428
If we're gonna find out

15:07.471 --> 15:09.517
who killed Yeoman Bennett
and why,

15:09.560 --> 15:11.345
she is the key.
I'll be at Loretta's.

15:11.388 --> 15:12.955
Copy that.

15:12.999 --> 15:15.740
All right, City Mouse,
let's go kick some butt.

15:15.784 --> 15:18.134
SEBASTIAN:
Turns out Yeoman Bennett

15:18.178 --> 15:19.527
wasn't the only
murder victim.

15:19.570 --> 15:20.876
After Doc Wade extracted

15:20.920 --> 15:22.878
all the bullet particles
from Bennett's brain,

15:22.922 --> 15:25.837
I then used our boss new
3-D scanner here

15:25.881 --> 15:29.145
to scan the particles
and recreate the bullet,

15:29.189 --> 15:30.581
digitally, of course.

15:30.625 --> 15:31.582
He's rather proud of himself.

15:31.626 --> 15:32.888
SEBASTIAN:
Yeah, I am.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.934
So, after I very deftly

15:34.977 --> 15:36.892
recreated the fragmentation
bullet, which, by the way,

15:36.936 --> 15:38.676
was a .380 slug,

15:38.720 --> 15:40.678
I then searched the FBI's
NIBIN database

15:40.722 --> 15:42.898
for any similar
shootings,

15:42.942 --> 15:44.465
and voilà.

15:44.508 --> 15:45.770
Apparently, a truck driver
was shot and killed

15:45.814 --> 15:46.815
three days ago in Slidell

15:46.858 --> 15:47.903
exactly the same way.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.470
Yeah, local sheriffs
just assumed

15:49.513 --> 15:51.167
it was another robbery,
but look-- I mean,

15:51.211 --> 15:53.953
it's way too specific of a hit
for it not to be connected.

15:53.996 --> 15:55.432
Which means, if we can
find that connection,

15:55.476 --> 15:56.999
it might lead us
to the killer.

15:57.043 --> 15:59.001
That's good work,
Sebastian.
I know.

15:59.045 --> 16:01.003
Yeah. Get Gregorio,
start looking.

16:01.047 --> 16:02.004
All right, I'm on it.

16:02.048 --> 16:03.614
PRIDE:
Huh.

16:03.658 --> 16:06.835
This is Dwayne Pride.

16:06.878 --> 16:10.404
Professor Handler.
How are you?

16:10.447 --> 16:12.406
Is everything all right?

16:12.449 --> 16:14.016
PRIDE:
Well, ha-hang on.

16:14.060 --> 16:16.801
I don't understand why
you're not calling her.

16:16.845 --> 16:20.980
Oh. No, no, I-I'm...
I'm glad you called.

16:21.023 --> 16:22.590
I didn't know.

16:22.633 --> 16:25.375
Yes, sir, of course.

16:25.419 --> 16:28.030
I'll talk to Laurel.
Thank you.

16:28.074 --> 16:29.901
Is Laurel okay?

16:29.945 --> 16:33.905
Yeah. Yeah, it-it...
it's nothing serious.

16:33.949 --> 16:37.518
That was the dean
of music at LSU.

16:37.561 --> 16:40.521
He recommended Laurel
for an internship

16:40.564 --> 16:41.957
with the New York
Philharmonic,

16:42.001 --> 16:43.524
and, apparently,
she got accepted, too.

16:43.567 --> 16:45.830
Dwayne, that's fantastic.

16:45.874 --> 16:47.876
Except, he just said
that she declined the offer.

16:47.919 --> 16:49.486
ReallyI don't know.

16:49.530 --> 16:51.271
I mean, this is actually
the first time I heard about

16:51.314 --> 16:52.663
any of this.

16:52.707 --> 16:54.230
I mean, I don't understand why
she wouldn't have

16:54.274 --> 16:56.841
told me about it-- why she'd
hide it from me, it just...

16:56.885 --> 16:59.279
Well...

16:59.322 --> 17:00.889
a wise man once told me

17:00.932 --> 17:04.936
that our kids sometimes
don't tell us things

17:04.980 --> 17:07.896
because they're afraid
of disappointing us.

17:07.939 --> 17:09.593
You believed it?

17:09.637 --> 17:11.204
Not at that time,
of course.

17:11.247 --> 17:13.989
But...

17:14.033 --> 17:16.992
turns out he was right.

17:23.216 --> 17:25.870
LASALLE: You're not an easy
woman to find, Ms. Collins.

17:25.914 --> 17:28.134
Of course, I'm assuming
that's the point,

17:28.177 --> 17:29.787
so you could keep
getting away

17:29.831 --> 17:31.398
with taking high rollers
for all they're worth.

17:31.441 --> 17:32.747
Or killing them.

17:32.790 --> 17:35.315
I don't know what
you're talking about.

17:35.358 --> 17:37.056
Okay, I never killed anyone.

17:37.099 --> 17:39.971
SONJA:
You were saying?

17:40.015 --> 17:41.886
Oh, my God.

17:41.930 --> 17:44.846
The last anybody saw
Ethan Bennett alive

17:44.889 --> 17:48.154
was before he went to the game
you invited him to.

17:48.197 --> 17:50.852
Now, common sense would say
you know who did this, and why.

17:50.895 --> 17:52.071
It means you could be

17:52.114 --> 17:53.811
an accessory to murder.

17:55.900 --> 17:56.945
I didn't know what to do.

17:56.988 --> 17:59.034
I-I just kept hoping
it would stop.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.645
I never imagined that
anybody would get hurt.

18:01.689 --> 18:03.821
You hoped what would stop?

18:05.562 --> 18:06.520
Hey, hey.

18:06.563 --> 18:09.305
Come on, Amy.

18:09.349 --> 18:11.220
If you're in trouble,
talk to us.

18:11.264 --> 18:13.048
Help us help you.

18:13.092 --> 18:16.051
Let's start with why you
targeted Yeoman Bennett.

18:16.095 --> 18:19.010
Not exactly a high roller.

18:20.273 --> 18:21.796
I was told to.

18:21.839 --> 18:23.363
Kurt knew Bennett
played poker,

18:23.406 --> 18:25.104
knew I could lure him
to the private game.

18:25.147 --> 18:27.236
Who's Kurt?
Kurt Young.

18:27.280 --> 18:31.675
Before he showed up,
I ran a clean game.

18:31.719 --> 18:34.591
High stakes, but fair.

18:34.635 --> 18:36.158
It's how I made ends meet

18:36.202 --> 18:38.160
after my divorce.

18:38.204 --> 18:40.945
Then a few weeks ago,
Kurt takes over.

18:40.989 --> 18:42.904
Forces me to do things.

18:42.947 --> 18:45.689
I never imagined
that he would

18:45.733 --> 18:47.300
kill this poor guy.

18:49.389 --> 18:52.435
They marked the cards,
cheated him.

18:54.394 --> 18:57.179
So he wanted Bennett to lose
to get leverage on him

18:57.223 --> 18:58.789
All I know is that
Kurt wanted me

18:58.833 --> 19:00.356
to recruit Bennett
because he worked

19:00.400 --> 19:02.097
at that Navy
research place.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.708
Stennis.Kurt's taking orders

19:04.752 --> 19:07.015
from some guy--
I've never met him,

19:07.058 --> 19:08.973
but I've overheard them
on the phone.

19:09.017 --> 19:12.151
They're looking for
someone else like Bennett.

19:12.194 --> 19:15.023
Someone else who works
at the Navy research lab?

19:15.066 --> 19:17.025
Well, Bennett wasn't the only
one who played poker.

19:17.068 --> 19:18.635
Some of his Navy pals did, too.

19:18.679 --> 19:21.247
Kurt said if I don't
find someone else

19:21.290 --> 19:23.205
to recruit tonight...

19:23.249 --> 19:25.076
he's gonna hurt my little boy.

19:28.123 --> 19:30.952
So, it turns out the other
murder victim had access

19:30.995 --> 19:32.258
to Stennis, too--
private contractor

19:32.301 --> 19:33.824
kept their vending
machines filled.

19:33.868 --> 19:35.913
And this mystery man,
who's Kurt's boss,

19:35.957 --> 19:38.133
is pressuring them to find
somebody else at Stennis.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.091
So, whatever they're after
has to be there.

19:40.135 --> 19:42.398
Have to assume that
Bennett didn't cooperate.

19:42.442 --> 19:43.921
Otherwise, they wouldn't
still be targeting people.

19:43.965 --> 19:45.227
The only problem is
there's no way

19:45.271 --> 19:47.011
to know what they're after.

19:47.055 --> 19:49.449
Stennis isn't just home
to NASA and naval research.

19:49.492 --> 19:52.234
They test-fire rocket engines,
lasers.

19:52.278 --> 19:53.714
NAVO's there,
SpaceX...

19:53.757 --> 19:55.411
All right, then,
we got to narrow it down.

19:55.455 --> 19:57.544
Start by figuring out
who this Kurt Young is

19:57.587 --> 19:59.110
and who he's working for.

19:59.154 --> 20:01.156
There's not much time
to do that if he's

20:01.200 --> 20:04.246
pressuring Amy to deliver
a new target by tonight.

20:04.290 --> 20:06.292
I'll get NOPD to put her son
in protective custody.

20:06.335 --> 20:08.511
That's not what I mean.

20:08.555 --> 20:09.773
If you ask me,

20:09.817 --> 20:11.297
the best and fastest way

20:11.340 --> 20:12.863
to figure out
who's behind this

20:12.907 --> 20:14.778
and what they want

20:14.822 --> 20:16.867
is to get Amy to get us
into that private game,

20:16.911 --> 20:18.869
and get Kurt to target us.

20:18.913 --> 20:21.872
You mean...
get him to target you.

20:21.916 --> 20:23.309
Look, I'm just saying

20:23.352 --> 20:25.267
we don't have
a lot of options.

20:25.311 --> 20:28.357
If Amy has to bring somebody,
why not me?

20:29.837 --> 20:31.273
I won't screw up again.

20:32.840 --> 20:34.015
SEBASTIAN: Devil's advocate,
real quick.

20:34.058 --> 20:35.321
I mean,
even if you could get

20:35.364 --> 20:37.279
into that game,
wh

20:37.323 --> 20:39.194
Didn't Amy say that they're
only targeting people

20:39.238 --> 20:40.369
who work at Stennis?

20:40.413 --> 20:42.284
Or people who have access
to Stennis.

20:42.328 --> 20:44.808
Private contractor
didn't work there.

20:44.852 --> 20:47.071
And Percy's access is...

20:47.115 --> 20:49.770
NCIS. It opens every Navy door.

20:49.813 --> 20:51.293
But if Kurt finds out
Sonja's NCIS,

20:51.337 --> 20:53.469
won't he smell a rat
because of Bennett?

20:53.513 --> 20:55.341
I doubt he knows
that we found Bennett's body.

20:55.384 --> 20:58.169
I mean, let alone are
investigating his murder.

20:58.213 --> 20:59.170
Yeah, but you can't be sure.

20:59.214 --> 21:00.433
That's a risk
we got to take

21:00.476 --> 21:01.695
if we want to solve
Bennett's murder

21:01.738 --> 21:03.131
and find out why
he was killed.

21:03.174 --> 21:05.873
Look, Amy's willing to help us.

21:05.916 --> 21:08.876
She can introduce me
to Kurt as a civilian,

21:08.919 --> 21:12.880
then secretly tell him I'm NCIS,
so he targets me.

21:12.923 --> 21:14.577
PRIDE: You're right,
it's our best chance.

21:14.621 --> 21:17.841
That said, they've already
killed two people,

21:17.885 --> 21:20.627
and we still don't know who
we're really up against.

21:20.670 --> 21:22.977
So, it's got to be
your call, Sonja.

21:41.169 --> 21:43.258
You scared

21:43.302 --> 21:45.347
Doing this type of stuff
is one of the reasons

21:45.391 --> 21:47.175
I wanted to join FBI
in the first place.

21:48.568 --> 21:50.700
Yeah. Surprised you
didn't take the job.

21:50.744 --> 21:52.223
Curious as to what
changed your mind.

21:52.267 --> 21:53.964
Yeah, I guess I didn't want
to break up the team.

21:54.008 --> 21:55.488
Can we just focus
on the plan here?

21:55.531 --> 21:58.142
Yeah, it's a plan I'm not
too crazy about, either.

21:58.186 --> 21:59.535
At least HQ's
on board this time.

21:59.579 --> 22:01.189
Ponied up
a lot of dough.

22:01.232 --> 22:02.712
I hope they're okay
with me losing it

22:02.756 --> 22:04.366
so Kurt gets his hooks into me.

22:04.410 --> 22:06.237
Yeah, I hope he doesn't
suspect it's a setup.

22:06.281 --> 22:08.327
Sonja Percy,
Christopher Lasalle.

22:08.370 --> 22:11.199
Check your list.

22:11.242 --> 22:13.114
Go ahead.Thank you.

22:17.597 --> 22:19.816
Don't worry,
Country Mouse.

22:19.860 --> 22:21.601
I got this.

22:34.004 --> 22:35.266
SONJA:
Four of a kind, baby.

22:35.310 --> 22:36.485
How's Sonja doing?

22:36.529 --> 22:38.095
Just had four to a flush.

22:38.139 --> 22:40.141
Just won a big blind special
with a double gutter.

22:40.184 --> 22:41.490
English, please.

22:41.534 --> 22:43.536
The girl is on fire.
She's winning big.
Okay.

22:43.579 --> 22:46.408
Any progress narrowing down
potential targets at Stennis?

22:46.452 --> 22:48.323
It's like looking for a needle
in a haystack.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.412
They got too many
classified projects.

22:50.456 --> 22:52.675
We better hope that Sonja
gets Kurt's attention.

22:52.719 --> 22:56.462
He goes after her when
she starts losing big.

22:56.505 --> 22:59.116
Gregorio, Sebastian,
everything still status quo?

22:59.160 --> 23:00.683
GREGORIO: Yeah, well,
if you call status quo

23:00.727 --> 23:02.903
all the firepower
they got out front,

23:02.946 --> 23:04.078
sure.

23:04.121 --> 23:05.427
Hey, this thing goes sideways,

23:05.471 --> 23:06.863
it could get ugly
real fast.

23:06.907 --> 23:08.387
PRIDE:
Why you're there.

23:08.430 --> 23:09.953
Counting on you
to have their backs.

23:09.997 --> 23:11.172
Keep us posted.

23:11.215 --> 23:12.434
SONJA:
Raise five grand.

23:12.478 --> 23:14.131
Man, it makes me
break out into a sweat

23:14.175 --> 23:15.698
just thinking about
betting that much money.

23:15.742 --> 23:18.135
I just hope Percy's not
pushing too hard, you know?

23:18.179 --> 23:20.877
Trying to make good
for messing up last night.

23:20.921 --> 23:22.357
You worried about her?

23:22.401 --> 23:25.142
DEALER: Straight wins.Always.

23:25.186 --> 23:27.536
SONJA: What do we say
we double the blind

23:27.580 --> 23:29.843
and make this a no

23:29.886 --> 23:31.497
Hell yeah. Why not?

23:31.540 --> 23:32.846
We all came to play,
didn't we?

23:32.889 --> 23:36.371
Hey, now we got
ourselves a game.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.504
LASALLE: Why don't, uh,
we take a little break, huh?

23:38.547 --> 23:40.288
Shh, shh, shh, no, baby.
I'm on a roll.

23:40.331 --> 23:42.508
Yeah, but it's my family money,
all right?

23:42.551 --> 23:43.726
And we agreed to a limit.

23:43.770 --> 23:47.164
Look, I already told you.
I got this.

23:50.603 --> 23:52.387
DEALER:
You're first to act, ma'am.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.389
Ten grand.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.304
DEALER:
Player bets $10,000.

23:56.347 --> 23:59.612
Water, please.

23:59.655 --> 24:01.396
How're you holding up, Amy?

24:01.440 --> 24:04.486
Just a little scared.I know.

24:04.530 --> 24:05.748
But you're doing
the right thing.

24:05.792 --> 24:07.489
Trust me, all right?

24:07.533 --> 24:09.752
Is that Kurt over there
on the fancy couch?

24:09.796 --> 24:11.406
Told him your partner
came to me last night,

24:11.450 --> 24:12.494
begged for a chance

24:12.538 --> 24:14.453
to win your money back.

24:14.496 --> 24:15.758
Said she didn't want
NCIS to find out

24:15.802 --> 24:17.543
about her gambling problem.

24:17.586 --> 24:19.196
Think he bought it?

24:19.240 --> 24:21.590
Think so.

24:21.634 --> 24:24.463
He's talking to whoever
he's working with right now.

24:24.506 --> 24:25.594
Well, we'll know
soon enough,

24:25.638 --> 24:27.509
as soon as Percy
starts losing.

24:27.553 --> 24:29.032
Oh, she will, too.

24:29.076 --> 24:31.644
Ronny over there
in the baseball cap,

24:31.687 --> 24:33.994
works for Kurt

24:34.037 --> 24:35.604
and he cheats.DEALER: All bets in.

24:35.648 --> 24:37.040
SONJA:
Thank you, dealer.

24:40.087 --> 24:41.480
Hey, King.

24:41.523 --> 24:43.438
Any leads

24:43.482 --> 24:45.440
on what they're after?

24:45.484 --> 24:46.920
No, we're still trying
to narrow it down.

24:46.963 --> 24:48.965
It might be up to Sonja
to lead us to it, though.

24:49.009 --> 24:51.185
Keep her focused.

24:51.228 --> 24:53.535
You get the sense anything
is not right,

24:53.579 --> 24:55.232
call it and get out of there.

24:55.276 --> 24:57.583
You got it.

25:01.238 --> 25:02.370
Call.

25:02.413 --> 25:03.719
DEALER:
Player calls.

25:05.678 --> 25:08.158
Be right back.

25:08.202 --> 25:10.509
Hey.

25:10.552 --> 25:12.162
Oh, hey, Daddy.

25:12.206 --> 25:14.208
You looked busy,
so I didn't want to bother you.

25:14.251 --> 25:16.689
Yeah, I know.

25:16.732 --> 25:19.387
Everything okay?I'm not sure.

25:19.430 --> 25:22.564
Got a strange call today
from your music dean.

25:22.608 --> 25:24.392
Why'd he call you?

25:24.435 --> 25:27.613
Actually said he'd been trying
to call you.

25:27.656 --> 25:29.266
Wondering why you turned
down the internship

25:29.310 --> 25:30.964
he worked so hard
to get you.

25:31.007 --> 25:34.620
Guess I'm a little curious as to
why you never told me about it.

25:34.663 --> 25:36.709
I mean, come on, Dad. I'm 23.

25:36.752 --> 25:39.581
There's a lot of things
I don't tell you.Yeah, well, I'm-I'm thinking

25:39.625 --> 25:41.583
it's something you
should've told me about,

25:41.627 --> 25:43.498
especially since your
future after college

25:43.542 --> 25:46.066
is mostly all we've been
talking about lately.

25:46.109 --> 25:47.676
There's nothing to talk about.

25:47.720 --> 25:49.330
I want to move back home.

25:49.373 --> 25:51.550
I don't want to live
in New York.Really?

25:51.593 --> 25:53.900
Then why'd you apply for the
internship in the first place?

25:53.943 --> 25:57.904
And why can't you seem to find
an apartment you like here?

25:57.947 --> 26:01.690
Even after looking at, what?
A dozen or more so far?

26:01.734 --> 26:05.128
PATTON: Yo, Pride. Might
want to come listen to this.

26:08.610 --> 26:10.351
We'll talk later.

26:16.618 --> 26:18.881
RONNY: Looking kind of nervous
there, little lady.

26:20.100 --> 26:21.710
15 thou to you.

26:21.754 --> 26:24.757
I see your 15.

26:24.800 --> 26:28.674
I raise you 15 more.

26:28.717 --> 26:31.720
Hey. What are you doing?

26:31.764 --> 26:33.592
I'm just doing
what I do, baby. Relax.

26:33.635 --> 26:35.332
I can't. All right?
You've been at this all night.

26:35.376 --> 26:37.291
You need to stop.

26:37.334 --> 26:39.075
Look, that's my money
and you're losing

26:39.119 --> 26:41.991
everything you won.Okay, I'm about to win it back.

26:42.035 --> 26:44.341
RONNY:
Reraise.

26:44.385 --> 26:45.778
All right, Pride.DEALER: Reraise another 20.

26:45.821 --> 26:47.954
Sounds like Percy's
about to make her play.

26:47.997 --> 26:49.477
All right.DEALER: It's to you, ma'am.

26:49.520 --> 26:51.740
Gregorio, you and Sebastian
be prepared

26:51.784 --> 26:53.046
to breach, just in case.

26:53.089 --> 26:54.656
Just give us the go.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.440
SONJA:
See your 20.

26:56.484 --> 27:01.445
And I raise you 20 more.

27:01.489 --> 27:02.882
That's $20,000 to you,

27:02.925 --> 27:04.405
Mr. Adler.

27:04.448 --> 27:05.798
RONNY:
I'll see your 20.

27:05.841 --> 27:08.061
Raise you 50 more.

27:08.104 --> 27:10.019
All right. That's it.
You're done.

27:10.063 --> 27:11.673
I'm gonna need you
to front me, Chris.

27:11.717 --> 27:14.067
I

27:14.110 --> 27:17.070
All right, look, admit it.
You're in way over your head.

27:17.113 --> 27:18.724
I know exactly what I'm doing.

27:18.767 --> 27:19.899
Are you calling my bet or not?

27:19.942 --> 27:21.291
Nobody's talking to you, pal.

27:21.335 --> 27:22.684
All right, we shouldn't
even be here.

27:22.728 --> 27:24.686
You know that?
You've got a problem.

27:24.730 --> 27:26.688
And I'm not willing to risk
any more of my money.

27:26.732 --> 27:29.822
Damn it, Chris,
don't give up on me!

27:29.865 --> 27:31.867
You're on your own. I'm done.No, wait, Chris. Chris.

27:31.911 --> 27:33.695
Wait. Chris!
No. Forget it.
Forget about it.

27:33.739 --> 27:34.870
Wait!

27:34.914 --> 27:36.263
Excuse me!

27:36.306 --> 27:37.830
My apologies.

27:37.873 --> 27:39.092
Now who the hell
do you think you are?

27:39.135 --> 27:40.702
Someone who's interested
in covering your bet.

27:40.746 --> 27:41.703
That's got to be Kurt.
Shh.

27:41.747 --> 27:42.922
SONJA:
Cover my bet?

27:42.965 --> 27:44.706
Why would you do that?
What's the catch?

27:44.750 --> 27:45.794
KURT:
No catch if you win.

27:45.838 --> 27:48.667
It's all yours.
But if you lose...

27:48.710 --> 27:50.451
let's just say you owe me.

27:50.494 --> 27:51.713
Owe you?

27:51.757 --> 27:54.803
Now what are you,
some kind of creep?

27:54.847 --> 27:58.415
I think the
bigger question here is...

27:58.459 --> 28:00.156
do you think you can win?

28:00.200 --> 28:03.290
Decision's yours.

28:04.857 --> 28:06.728
Chris, Kurt has
approached Sonja.

28:06.772 --> 28:08.295
You close?

28:14.780 --> 28:15.781
Chris?

28:17.347 --> 28:19.262
Lasalle's comm stopped working.SONJA: All right, I'm in.

28:19.306 --> 28:20.742
What happened?
I don't know.

28:34.451 --> 28:36.845
Ace-high straight.
Now beat that.

28:37.803 --> 28:40.196
Full house. Aces full of tens.

28:40.240 --> 28:41.589
What?!

28:41.632 --> 28:43.199
Looks like you're out
$110,000, little lady.

28:43.243 --> 28:46.594
Gregorio, did you see Lasalle
leave the mansion?

28:46.637 --> 28:47.943
No. He never came out.

28:47.987 --> 28:50.380
Where the hell is he?RONNY: Come to daddy.

28:51.991 --> 28:53.122
Ugh.

28:53.166 --> 28:54.689
No, no, no, no.
A deal's a deal.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.517
Screw you. He cheated!

28:56.560 --> 28:57.779
He had to!

28:57.823 --> 28:59.172
Please don't make a scene.

28:59.215 --> 29:00.521
You'll just make it
more difficult.

29:00.564 --> 29:02.479
And who the hell are you?

29:02.523 --> 29:04.830
My name is Henry Chen.

29:04.873 --> 29:07.920
And since you've lost,
you now owe me.

29:07.963 --> 29:12.751
Look, pal, I don't know
what's going on here, but...

29:16.842 --> 29:19.627
Like my man said,
a deal's a deal.

29:40.996 --> 29:42.432
Whoever this Chen guy is,

29:42.476 --> 29:43.956
he's taken Sonja into the car
with one of his thugs.

29:43.999 --> 29:45.827
Do you want us to move in?

29:45.871 --> 29:47.829
No, stay there.

29:47.873 --> 29:49.788
They must have Christopher;
possibly Amy, too.

29:49.831 --> 29:52.660
Leverage in case
this is a setup.

29:52.703 --> 29:53.835
You get the photo
Sebastian sent?

29:53.879 --> 29:55.619
They're just coming
through now.
Okay.

29:55.663 --> 29:57.186
Well, we need to figure out
who this guy Chen is.

29:57.230 --> 29:58.274
I'm all over it, King.

29:58.318 --> 29:59.841
I'm running facial recognition,

29:59.885 --> 30:02.017
checking every database
known to man.
Okay.

30:02.061 --> 30:03.845
Well, hold on. What about Percy?PRIDE: They got her for access.

30:03.889 --> 30:05.586
Got to be taking her
to Stennis.

30:05.629 --> 30:08.023
I'm headed there now.Yeah, but the
complex is too big.

30:08.067 --> 30:09.851
We still don't know
what they're after.PRIDE: Well, we will

30:09.895 --> 30:12.027
when Patton figures out who
the hell we're dealing with.

30:12.071 --> 30:14.203
No pressure there.Look, Gregorio,

30:14.247 --> 30:15.988
you two find out where
they're holding Christopher.

30:16.031 --> 30:18.077
But unless he's
in imminent danger,

30:18.120 --> 30:19.992
don't make a move
until you hear from me.

30:20.035 --> 30:21.036
Right, because
if Chen realizes

30:21.080 --> 30:22.429
that we just rescued
his leverage...

30:22.472 --> 30:23.996
GREGORIO:
They'll know it was a setup

30:24.039 --> 30:25.606
and then take Percy out.I'm counting on you.

30:25.649 --> 30:28.000
All right, Patton.
Get me Chen.

30:28.043 --> 30:30.045
You want me to call Stennis
and put the center on alert?

30:30.089 --> 30:31.307
No, that'll
alert Chen, too.

30:31.351 --> 30:32.656
Put Percy at even
greater risk.

30:32.700 --> 30:34.310
No, our only chance

30:34.354 --> 30:35.877
is to save her
and stop them ourselves.

30:35.921 --> 30:37.096
Get to it!

30:50.544 --> 30:51.588
This isn't gonna work.

30:51.632 --> 30:52.894
We don't even have passes.

30:52.938 --> 30:54.853
NCIS doesn't need passes.

30:54.896 --> 30:58.291
So, what? I don't do this,
you shoot me, my friend?

30:58.334 --> 30:59.988
You know,
you'll die, too.

31:00.032 --> 31:01.163
The guards will kill you.

31:01.207 --> 31:02.599
CHEN:
If I don't succeed,

31:02.643 --> 31:04.863
the people who sent me
are gonna kill me anyways.

31:04.906 --> 31:06.125
So this is the only chance

31:06.168 --> 31:08.954
either one of us
has of surviving.

31:08.997 --> 31:10.781
Your choice.

31:18.093 --> 31:19.007
GUARD:
Morning, ma'am.

31:19.051 --> 31:20.226
I.D.s, please.

31:20.269 --> 31:22.924
Special Agent Sonja Percy, NCIS.

31:22.968 --> 31:27.929
And, uh, two forensics experts.

31:32.194 --> 31:34.240
It's a counterintelligence
investigation.

31:34.283 --> 31:36.807
I can't tell you any more.

31:42.770 --> 31:45.077
Welcome to Stennis.

31:45.120 --> 31:46.687
Stay clear of the A-5 Stand.
We've got a launch scheduled

31:46.730 --> 31:47.949
in less than two hours.

31:47.993 --> 31:48.950
Copy that.

31:52.127 --> 31:53.868
All right.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.957
Where to?

31:56.001 --> 31:57.916
The A-5 launch.

31:59.178 --> 32:00.962
Drive the speed limit.

32:01.006 --> 32:03.138
We don't want any
unwanted attention.

32:09.144 --> 32:10.667
:
There's guards everywhere.

32:10.711 --> 32:12.104
: Well, Lasalle's
got to be down here.

32:12.147 --> 32:13.235
We checked everywhere else.

32:16.021 --> 32:17.761
GREGORIO:
Shh.

32:20.634 --> 32:22.679
:
Got eyes on Lasalle, Patton.

32:22.723 --> 32:23.942
He's got Amy, too.

32:23.985 --> 32:25.160
PATTON:
Copy that. Stand by.

32:25.204 --> 32:27.989
Pride is almost at Stennis.
Watch your back.

32:28.033 --> 32:29.295
Just found out
that Chen and Kurt

32:29.338 --> 32:30.949
are both working for the MSS.

32:30.992 --> 32:32.298
Calling Pride now.

32:32.341 --> 32:35.083
:
Chinese CIA. Great.

32:35.127 --> 32:37.172
[man continues
speaking Mandarin]

32:37.216 --> 32:38.695
Hey, Pride, I got a match,

32:38.739 --> 32:40.001
but I don't think
you gonna like this.

32:40.045 --> 32:41.133
PRIDE:
Talk to me.

32:41.176 --> 32:43.004
"Henry Chen" turned out
to be an alias.

32:43.048 --> 32:45.485
When I crosschecked facial
recognition with his buddy Kurt,

32:45.528 --> 32:48.488
they both popped up
on DCI's watch list for MSS.

32:48.531 --> 32:49.924
Chinese operatives.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.186
Does that narrow down
why they want access?

32:51.230 --> 32:52.361
Got to be the Tetris satellite.

32:52.405 --> 32:54.015
It's set to launch this morning.

32:54.059 --> 32:56.583
It's packed with the Navy's
newest tracking technology.

32:56.626 --> 32:57.714
They want to destroy it?

32:57.758 --> 32:59.151
More likely, they want to bug it

32:59.194 --> 33:01.675
so they can monitor
every ship and sub in our fleet.

33:01.718 --> 33:04.069
Hang on, Patton, hang on.

33:05.070 --> 33:07.028
Did another agent
just come through here?

33:07.072 --> 33:08.160
Yes, sir,
about five minutes ago.

33:08.203 --> 33:09.683
I need to know where
the Tetris satellite

33:09.726 --> 33:11.163
launches from, stat.

33:11.206 --> 33:12.729
The A-5, sir.
Thank you.

33:12.773 --> 33:14.035
Go ahead, Patton.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.305
CHEN:
What are you doing?

33:23.349 --> 33:24.524
Keep driving,
or your boyfriend's dead.

33:24.567 --> 33:26.091
Okay, first of all, he's not

33:26.134 --> 33:28.049
my boyfriend.
It's a complicated story,

33:28.093 --> 33:29.268
but I don't have time
to get into it right now.

33:29.311 --> 33:31.139
I said drive.Second of all,

33:31.183 --> 33:33.272
I think you're gonna
kill us both anyway, right?

33:33.315 --> 33:37.102
And since I'm just now realizing
that the only reason I decided

33:37.145 --> 33:38.668
to stay at NCIS
is because I didn't want

33:38.712 --> 33:42.107
to let the team down,
I'm not gonna.

33:42.150 --> 33:43.978
What are you talking about?

33:44.022 --> 33:45.240
You think I'm bluffing?

33:45.284 --> 33:47.155
No, but I'm not bluffing either.

33:47.199 --> 33:48.809
Hey!

34:09.438 --> 34:12.180
Alfa, code three.

34:12.224 --> 34:14.182
That car's out of control!

34:14.226 --> 34:15.444
Close the gate.

34:22.712 --> 34:24.497
All right, I got to stop Percy.

34:24.540 --> 34:26.760
Get Lasalle out of there now.
Go, go, go!

34:32.635 --> 34:33.810
NCIS. Freeze!

34:38.685 --> 34:40.730
We got to go, before
the other guards come.

34:40.774 --> 34:42.645
What about Percy?

34:47.607 --> 34:48.825
Sonja, look back.

34:48.869 --> 34:49.652
Come on!

35:14.764 --> 35:15.635
PRIDE:
Stand down!

35:15.678 --> 35:17.027
NCIS!

35:17.071 --> 35:18.725
Stand down!
Stand down!

35:22.424 --> 35:23.860
Hold your fire!

35:28.952 --> 35:30.867
PRIDE: You all right?Yeah.

35:30.911 --> 35:31.781
I think so.

35:31.825 --> 35:32.913
How's Christopher?

35:32.956 --> 35:34.088
Uh...

35:36.960 --> 35:38.701
Looks like he's all right.

35:40.964 --> 35:42.923
I'm not sure
that was the best decision

35:42.966 --> 35:44.707
you were about
to make there.

35:44.751 --> 35:47.710
Well, it seems
to be a pattern lately.

36:00.723 --> 36:02.421
Oh... Hey.

36:02.464 --> 36:04.205
Uh, Laurel, I...

36:04.249 --> 36:06.207
I'm sorry. Uh...

36:06.251 --> 36:07.643
Thank you so much for waiting.

36:07.687 --> 36:09.297
It's okay.

36:09.341 --> 36:11.517
I think I'm used to it
after all these years.

36:11.560 --> 36:14.128
Ouch.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.435
Not sure that's a good thing.

36:16.478 --> 36:18.132
Your mother

36:18.176 --> 36:20.134
certainly never thought it was.

36:20.178 --> 36:23.703
Yeah, well, I'm not Mom.

36:25.052 --> 36:26.836
I know what you do
and why you do it, Daddy,

36:26.880 --> 36:28.142
and I'm proud of that.

36:28.186 --> 36:31.145
Proud when I walk
around town

36:31.189 --> 36:32.712
and people realize
I'm your daughter.

36:39.893 --> 36:42.504
I just feel like I didn't get
to spend any time with you

36:42.548 --> 36:43.636
while you were here.

36:43.679 --> 36:44.724
You sure you got to go back now?

36:46.813 --> 36:48.902
Can't graduate
if I don't go to class.

36:48.945 --> 36:51.905
Can't get that internship
if you don't graduate, either.

36:54.603 --> 36:55.778
Still available?

36:57.954 --> 37:00.870
Yes.

37:00.914 --> 37:02.742
You want it?

37:02.785 --> 37:05.919
Then go get it,
honey. Go.

37:05.962 --> 37:07.747
Go to New York.

37:07.790 --> 37:09.052
Don't worry about me.

37:09.096 --> 37:10.793
You got to follow your heart.

37:10.837 --> 37:11.838
Yeah, but you're
all alone here.

37:11.881 --> 37:13.666
You don't have any family...

37:13.709 --> 37:15.058
What are you talking about?
I got you, don't I?

37:15.102 --> 37:16.712
No matter where you are.

37:16.756 --> 37:18.888
And I got my team,
my friends.

37:18.932 --> 37:21.282
Rita comes down to visit

37:21.326 --> 37:22.849
every once in a
while from D.C.

37:22.892 --> 37:23.937
You're a grown woman,

37:23.980 --> 37:25.721
Laurel.

37:25.765 --> 37:26.983
You got to do
what's best for you,

37:27.027 --> 37:29.769
not somebody else.

37:29.812 --> 37:32.772
Even if that somebody else
is me.

37:35.992 --> 37:37.472
Hey.

37:39.257 --> 37:43.043
I'll always be here for you.

37:44.305 --> 37:46.394
I love you, Daddy.

37:46.438 --> 37:48.396
I love you, too.

37:48.440 --> 37:50.964
More than you'll ever know.

38:03.542 --> 38:05.892
SONJA:
Pride?

38:08.068 --> 38:11.289
Hey, what's up?

38:11.332 --> 38:12.638
You okay?

38:12.681 --> 38:14.335
Yeah.

38:14.379 --> 38:16.468
No. Um, I don't know.

38:16.511 --> 38:20.385
I'm just nervous, I guess.

38:20.428 --> 38:21.603
Don't be.

38:21.647 --> 38:22.735
I understand.

38:25.346 --> 38:27.827
FBI's gonna be lucky
to have you.

38:27.870 --> 38:30.090
How did you know?

38:30.133 --> 38:32.832
I know you.

38:32.875 --> 38:35.965
I really wanted to make
it work for me here, Pride,

38:36.009 --> 38:37.489
I really did.

38:37.532 --> 38:39.012
You know, I love NCIS.

38:39.055 --> 38:40.230
I love all the work
that we've done,

38:40.274 --> 38:42.842
how much I've grown, learned.

38:42.885 --> 38:44.713
But it's time to move on.

38:44.757 --> 38:46.628
Feel like I just had

38:46.672 --> 38:48.630
this conversation-- look,

38:48.674 --> 38:52.199
I didn't stay at
the sheriff's office forever,

38:52.242 --> 38:54.897
even though I loved it.

38:54.941 --> 38:58.858
Had an opportunity here,
took it, and I'm glad I did.

38:58.901 --> 39:01.904
Sometimes you got to give up
something to get something.

39:01.948 --> 39:04.124
I, um...

39:04.167 --> 39:06.909
I just didn't want to let
the team down by leaving.

39:06.953 --> 39:10.260
It's a noble reason,
for sure, just...

39:10.304 --> 39:11.784
not a good one.

39:14.221 --> 39:17.964
You're a terrific agent, Percy,
you really are.

39:18.007 --> 39:21.010
I'm not gonna
lie to you.

39:21.054 --> 39:23.230
I'm gonna miss you.

39:40.203 --> 39:43.076
Suppose I should
tell the others now.

39:44.294 --> 39:46.296
Pretty sure they already know.

39:58.874 --> 40:01.486
I hate you, making me cry.

40:01.529 --> 40:03.052
I'm so sorry.

40:03.096 --> 40:05.228
No, don't be sorry, baby.

40:05.272 --> 40:06.839
It's good.

40:06.882 --> 40:09.102
It's what you want, right?Yeah.

40:09.145 --> 40:11.191
PATTON: Well, listen, baby,
that's all that matters, girl.

40:11.234 --> 40:12.584
You know what?

40:12.627 --> 40:14.716
Matter of fact, I'm tired
of vegan stuff, anyway.

40:14.760 --> 40:17.458
So get your tofu,

40:17.502 --> 40:19.025
rice cake-eating ass
out of here.

40:20.505 --> 40:22.028
Yeah, you know,
plus, we already...

40:22.071 --> 40:23.464
we already thought
that you were leaving anyway,

40:23.508 --> 40:25.074
so honestly,
at this point, it's just,

40:25.118 --> 40:26.815
you know, it's old news.

40:26.859 --> 40:29.122
So I'm also gonna
call dibs on your desk.

40:29.165 --> 40:31.080
What?
PATTON:
Oh, man.

40:31.124 --> 40:33.082
The corpse ain't even cold yet,

40:33.126 --> 40:34.606
and you already measuring
for drapes?

40:34.649 --> 40:35.998
I love you.Uh-huh.

40:36.042 --> 40:37.522
It's just real drafty
by that door.

40:37.565 --> 40:39.959
Come on, everybody,
let's go to the bar,

40:40.002 --> 40:41.526
and do this right.

40:41.569 --> 40:43.005
I'll call Loretta,
tell her to meet us there.

40:43.049 --> 40:44.790
PATTON: Yes, sir.
Good liquor, free liquor.

40:51.797 --> 40:54.756
I'll... I'll catch up with you.

41:06.376 --> 41:08.770
You mad at me?

41:08.814 --> 41:09.989
No.

41:10.032 --> 41:12.034
No, I'm happy for you.

41:12.078 --> 41:14.515
It's just...

41:14.559 --> 41:16.256
What?

41:16.299 --> 41:18.258
I don't know.

41:18.301 --> 41:22.131
Now that this is
really happening,

41:22.175 --> 41:24.743
and you really
are leaving,

41:24.786 --> 41:29.051
I can't help but to wonder
what might've been.

41:29.095 --> 41:32.054
Me, too.

41:34.100 --> 41:36.929
It's kind of funny.

41:36.972 --> 41:40.367
We chose not to follow through
for the good of the team,

41:40.410 --> 41:42.761
and you almost
sacrificed yourself today

41:42.804 --> 41:44.980
for the same reason.Yeah, well,

41:45.024 --> 41:48.897
I came in a lone wolf,
leaving a team player.

41:48.941 --> 41:50.508
Yes, you are.

41:51.944 --> 41:54.294
I'm gonna miss you, City Mouse.

41:56.731 --> 41:59.299
I'll miss you, too,
Country Mouse.

42:07.786 --> 42:09.309
Come on.

42:10.702 --> 42:12.181
Let's go be with our friends.

42:12.225 --> 42:15.228
I'll be right there.
