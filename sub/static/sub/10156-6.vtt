00:53.360 --> 00:54.930
Aside from the money wasted,

00:55.000 --> 00:57.367
and the embarrassment
to our American friends,

00:58.240 --> 01:02.723
the debacle at the Turkish-Syrian border
has put us back five years

01:02.800 --> 01:05.883
in terms of intelligence sourcing
with Syria and the Middle East.

01:06.520 --> 01:09.126
I'm extending the meeting
so we can fully explore the reasons

01:09.240 --> 01:12.961
why the operation went ahead
with such poor and corrupted intelligence,

01:13.360 --> 01:16.330
and what lessons can be learnt
to ensure this never happens again.

01:17.280 --> 01:20.409
What led you to believe
that British arms were being exported

01:20.480 --> 01:22.050
under the counter through TradePass?

01:22.640 --> 01:25.564
I was shown fake MOD end user certificates

01:25.840 --> 01:29.049
for seven different arms companies,
UK and US.

01:29.920 --> 01:31.001
Do you mean these?

01:38.400 --> 01:39.447
Yes.

01:40.200 --> 01:44.728
Those are genuine MOD export certificates
for Bulgaria and Italy.

01:44.880 --> 01:45.881
That's not true.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.369
I have signed letters from both Italian and
Bulgarian governments confirming the sales.

01:50.600 --> 01:51.800
This is a cover up.

01:52.040 --> 01:55.522
Angela, are you accusing me of lying?

01:56.560 --> 01:58.801
I spoke
to Rex Mayhew during his handover,

01:58.880 --> 02:00.450
before he joined the Royal Commission.

02:00.560 --> 02:04.531
He said that you persuaded someone to leak
information from the River House.

02:04.840 --> 02:07.081
Someone you referred to as the Boatman?

02:10.759 --> 02:12.489
I've never heard of such a name.

02:12.840 --> 02:15.160
Then how did you
get hold of those certificates?

02:15.480 --> 02:16.970
They're classified documents.

02:17.400 --> 02:19.129
An angel gave them to me.

02:19.200 --> 02:20.611
With a halo.

02:23.200 --> 02:26.170
You do understand the seriousness
of this enquiry, Ms Burr?

02:30.400 --> 02:33.051
Let us now move on to
the arms swoop itself.

02:33.560 --> 02:36.803
Based on what we now know
to be flawed intelligence,

02:36.880 --> 02:39.770
you authorised, through
an American Enforcement connection,

02:39.840 --> 02:41.490
and behind the FCO's back,

02:41.640 --> 02:46.567
a full US military raid on 20 aid trucks
crossing the Turkish-Syrian border.

02:47.080 --> 02:49.321
Rex Mayhew authorised it. Not me.

02:49.520 --> 02:50.521
On his last day.

02:50.720 --> 02:54.088
And on your cast-iron guarantee
that the intelligence was solid.

02:56.200 --> 02:57.645
Where did you get this intelligence?

03:00.000 --> 03:03.049
A source close to TradePass
and Richard Roper.

03:04.360 --> 03:05.850
Can you be more specific?

03:09.680 --> 03:13.048
To do so would be to put lives at risk.
No, I can't do that.

03:13.240 --> 03:15.971
Mmm, this is a behind-closed-doors
enquiry, Ms Burr.

03:16.040 --> 03:18.361
Names will be redacted
from the records. So,

03:19.200 --> 03:20.440
why can't you tell us?

03:21.480 --> 03:22.891
You know why.

03:24.920 --> 03:26.570
You all know why.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.125
They pulled out this morning.

03:52.680 --> 03:54.011
Order from the Ministry.

03:55.560 --> 03:57.449
So it's just you and me again then, is it?

03:57.840 --> 03:59.080
Not even that, I'm afraid.

03:59.560 --> 04:01.562
Two weeks and they close the office.

04:02.240 --> 04:05.289
The International Enforcement Agency
is officially mothballed.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.286
Go home, Angela.

04:08.600 --> 04:09.840
Have your baby.

04:10.320 --> 04:11.401
Be a teacher's wife.

04:12.480 --> 04:15.006
You mean give up? What about Pine?

04:15.080 --> 04:16.923
Pine gave you false intelligence.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.959
- I don't believe that.
- Are you sure about that?

04:19.000 --> 04:21.959
I went to him. I got him involved in this.
I can't just leave him in there.

04:22.520 --> 04:23.840
I don't see what choice you have.

04:27.880 --> 04:29.840
Oh, didn't you hear?
You don't work here any more.

04:29.920 --> 04:32.082
I just wanted to say thank you.

04:32.800 --> 04:34.480
And if you ever needed help in the future.

04:34.520 --> 04:35.885
Ah, well, don't hold your breath.

04:36.880 --> 04:37.961
Angela Burr.

04:39.080 --> 04:40.127
Who is this?

04:40.880 --> 04:42.440
<i>Yes, is Sophie there, please?</i>

04:42.520 --> 04:44.887
- Sophie? No there isn't a...
<i>- Well, when she comes,</i>

04:45.480 --> 04:47.369
<i>could you tell her we're all here.</i>

04:48.360 --> 04:49.805
<i>At the same hotel.</i>

04:50.680 --> 04:52.250
<i>Tell her we're all here.</i>

05:05.080 --> 05:06.161
He's in Cairo.

05:14.560 --> 05:17.882
Mr Roper, your courier has arrived.
I'll send him up.

05:17.960 --> 05:19.121
Thank you.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.165
Thank you very much.

05:51.480 --> 05:52.960
You ever been to Cairo before?

05:53.680 --> 05:54.886
No, erm...

05:55.000 --> 05:58.482
I've spent some time in Morocco and Tunisia,
but this is my first time in Egypt.

05:58.720 --> 05:59.846
Well, you should take advantage.

05:59.920 --> 06:01.888
See the sights while
we're off down the Nile.

06:03.480 --> 06:04.606
Andrew isn't coming with us?

06:05.520 --> 06:06.760
Absolutely not.

06:07.840 --> 06:09.683
You and I are going to be very busy.

06:10.680 --> 06:15.288
Why, Richard Roper,
I do declare...

06:21.760 --> 06:23.410
Speaking of true love...

06:26.000 --> 06:27.001
What's she doing here?

06:27.200 --> 06:28.884
Thought you might want some
female company.

06:29.400 --> 06:30.401
Caroline.

06:33.120 --> 06:34.281
Look who's back.

06:34.480 --> 06:36.050
Caro, lovely to see you.

06:36.360 --> 06:37.521
- Thank you.
- Morning, Sandy.

06:37.920 --> 06:40.002
- Morning.
- Hi, darling.

06:40.640 --> 06:41.641
Great to see you.

06:42.520 --> 06:45.171
Er, listen, I just need a few minutes
with the young prince here,

06:45.400 --> 06:48.210
so why don't you girls
go and lay waste to the local bazaar?

06:50.440 --> 06:51.646
Fine, baby.

06:54.400 --> 06:55.481
Tabby, would you?

06:56.280 --> 06:58.200
- See you later.
- See you later.

06:59.680 --> 07:01.409
- Coffee?
- Thank you.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.525
You know what this reminds me of?

07:09.040 --> 07:12.567
Winston Churchill and TE Lawrence
in a Cairo hotel

07:12.640 --> 07:15.371
dividing up the Middle East
over champagne and a cigar.

07:17.160 --> 07:19.731
Drew a map on a napkin and shook hands.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.165
Kings of Arabia.

07:25.280 --> 07:28.648
I'm guessing that you're
Churchill in this scenario.

07:28.800 --> 07:29.961
If you insist.

07:33.320 --> 07:34.606
Damn shame about Corky, though.

07:35.480 --> 07:36.766
I feel as if...

07:37.320 --> 07:39.448
If I'd known, I could probably have
talked him round.

07:40.120 --> 07:43.602
Could have explained that
even traitors can be forgiven.

07:45.560 --> 07:47.050
Actually be pretty useful.

07:47.120 --> 07:49.805
Keep tabs on the enemy.
Blow smoke in their face.

07:50.280 --> 07:52.521
But they have to commit, that's the thing.

07:53.320 --> 07:54.810
Have to make a decision.

07:58.160 --> 07:59.889
I don't know why I'm telling you this.

08:00.160 --> 08:02.000
You've already made your decision,
haven't you?

08:03.400 --> 08:04.640
A long time ago.

08:06.400 --> 08:07.401
Kings of Arabia.

08:10.720 --> 08:12.643
Freddie Hamid, how are you?

08:12.840 --> 08:14.763
- Hello, sir.
- Good to see you.

08:15.640 --> 08:17.642
May I introduce Andrew Birch, our director.

08:19.560 --> 08:22.723
Pleasure to meet you, Freddie.
Dickie's told me lots about you.

08:25.400 --> 08:26.765
Welcome to Cairo.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.569
- Thank you.
- It's going to be fun.

08:29.320 --> 08:30.321
Oh, I can't wait.

08:31.800 --> 08:33.086
Well. Shall we?

08:58.760 --> 08:59.886
Mr Kouyami.

09:01.440 --> 09:03.841
East is East and West is West.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.443
And never the twain shall meet.

09:07.120 --> 09:08.406
Good to see you, Mr Roper.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.081
After you.

09:19.040 --> 09:22.761
So, spec list, not changed?

09:23.040 --> 09:24.121
It's all there, sir.

09:24.200 --> 09:28.000
The consignment's being held in a secure
military zone on the outskirts of the city.

09:28.280 --> 09:29.327
Ready for collection.

09:29.920 --> 09:31.331
And the payment structure?

09:31.760 --> 09:33.842
As discussed.
Half now and half on exchange.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.004
We'll meet again in 48 hours' time.

09:39.320 --> 09:41.402
Then, if all parties are satisfied,

09:41.480 --> 09:44.802
I suggest we sanction
the first half of the payment

09:44.920 --> 09:46.445
to be made to the TradePass account.

09:55.400 --> 09:56.401
Wait.

09:57.080 --> 10:01.051
We had report of an incident
involving US military at the Syrian border.

10:02.160 --> 10:05.642
I want your reassurance that there is
no risk attached to this transaction.

10:06.680 --> 10:08.409
Can you give this assurance, Mr Roper?

10:11.200 --> 10:13.407
We had a minor issue.

10:13.520 --> 10:14.601
Internal.

10:15.120 --> 10:17.361
It's been investigated and addressed.

10:18.040 --> 10:19.087
You have my word.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.001
Let us proceed.

10:55.800 --> 10:57.040
It's done.

11:01.400 --> 11:02.401
Thank you.

11:03.600 --> 11:05.040
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

11:17.120 --> 11:18.246
Who needs another drink?

11:20.080 --> 11:21.366
Oh, not for me.

11:24.920 --> 11:26.160
Smile at me. Laugh.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.001
Tell me a joke then.

11:31.880 --> 11:33.450
I can't do this any more, Jonathan.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.162
I can't. I can't sleep
with him another night.

11:36.760 --> 11:37.761
You have to.

11:38.840 --> 11:40.640
Why can't we go away?
Just the two of us. Now.

11:41.160 --> 11:42.730
It isn't just about you and me.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.729
Funny, funny joke.

11:53.040 --> 11:54.246
A courier came last night.

11:55.560 --> 11:57.085
Delivered papers about the shipment.

11:57.200 --> 11:58.440
They're in the safe.

11:59.080 --> 12:00.200
Do you know the combination?

12:00.920 --> 12:02.081
I'll get it for you.

12:07.040 --> 12:08.041
Be careful.

12:10.760 --> 12:13.764
Excuse me, sir,
could I have a vodka martini, please?

13:01.920 --> 13:03.046
You're up early.

13:03.480 --> 13:04.606
We're going shopping.

13:05.040 --> 13:06.769
You can't have too many rugs, apparently.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.007
Right.

13:08.560 --> 13:09.686
Look at you.

13:10.280 --> 13:12.328
Quite the Roper acolyte.

13:12.720 --> 13:14.051
How things change.

13:15.880 --> 13:16.961
Yes, they do, don't they?

13:17.400 --> 13:21.007
Me? Oh, I'm the prodigal wife brought to heel.
Didn't you hear?

13:21.960 --> 13:22.961
Brought to heel by what?

13:23.040 --> 13:24.724
Roper made me an offer.

13:25.040 --> 13:27.566
Let bygones be bygones
and return to the fold.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.244
Very... Very decent of him.

13:29.880 --> 13:30.927
That may be.

13:32.160 --> 13:34.447
Or maybe he just wanted someone
to spy on his girlfriend.

13:40.440 --> 13:41.601
Careful, Caro.

13:42.640 --> 13:43.641
Sun's hot out there.

13:45.920 --> 13:46.921
Caro, is that true?

13:51.880 --> 13:54.690
He said if I didn't agree,
I'd never see the children again.

13:57.600 --> 13:58.647
I hate him.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.848
Message from London.

14:42.880 --> 14:44.211
I didn't expect you to come.

14:44.480 --> 14:45.686
Oh, ye of little faith.

14:52.680 --> 14:54.648
Actually, it was me that took
some persuading.

14:56.320 --> 14:57.606
- I don't know who you are.
- Oh, sorry.

14:57.720 --> 14:59.802
Joel Steadman,
American Enforcement Agency.

14:59.920 --> 15:02.321
- Pine.
- And I think you might be playing both sides.

15:03.800 --> 15:05.245
Wait. What are you talking about?
What is this?

15:05.320 --> 15:06.367
There was a leak.

15:06.920 --> 15:08.320
The leak was at your end, not mine.

15:09.640 --> 15:10.801
I killed a man to patch it.

15:11.680 --> 15:12.681
Corkoran?

15:15.160 --> 15:17.401
Jonathan, if you want to get out now,
I can get you out.

15:17.480 --> 15:18.527
- No.
- There is still time left...

15:18.640 --> 15:20.324
You don't want that and nor do I.
We're so close.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.084
I don't have an organisation any more.

15:22.200 --> 15:23.611
I've got no recourse to troops.

15:23.680 --> 15:25.250
No international enforcement support.

15:25.760 --> 15:27.922
Just a cowboy and a pregnant woman.
That's your army.

15:28.960 --> 15:31.930
Jonathan, if things go wrong,
I can't guarantee I can get you out.

15:33.480 --> 15:35.164
I was living half a life when you met me.

15:35.800 --> 15:37.131
I've got nothing to lose.

15:38.200 --> 15:39.611
But I will need your help.

15:46.160 --> 15:47.207
OK.

15:47.520 --> 15:48.681
What can we do?

15:55.000 --> 15:56.240
<i>Yalla,</i> one mixed salad.

16:02.960 --> 16:05.566
Erm, I'm looking for
someone called Youssef.

16:09.360 --> 16:10.361
That's me.

16:10.480 --> 16:14.371
I hear you're a good man to speak to
about a recipe for, um, tourli.

16:14.920 --> 16:15.967
- Tourli?
- Tourli.

16:16.040 --> 16:18.486
- We can speak about that?
- You want to speak about tourli?

16:18.560 --> 16:19.686
Yes.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.365
- OK.
- OK.

16:22.440 --> 16:23.487
OK.

16:27.680 --> 16:28.727
Wait.

16:44.280 --> 16:45.361
How are you?

16:45.440 --> 16:48.569
- Jonathan, you look great. Look at you.
- Oh, come on, look at you, Mr Head Chef.

16:48.640 --> 16:51.530
- You got the hat and everything.
- Are you serious? Look at your watch.

16:51.600 --> 16:52.886
- Oh, come on...
- How much is this, huh?

16:52.960 --> 16:54.040
Come on, it's just a watch.

16:54.400 --> 16:55.606
How are you?

16:56.520 --> 16:58.284
What happened to you? You just disappeared.

16:58.360 --> 17:00.124
I know. I know.

17:00.640 --> 17:01.846
And how is your Arabic, eh?

17:02.040 --> 17:03.280
You remember everything I taught you?

17:03.360 --> 17:05.965
Ah, it's a little rusty.
I am... I am practising.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.445
Your brother, Akhmed. He's well?

17:09.520 --> 17:10.760
Is he still active?

17:11.800 --> 17:13.040
What do you mean, still active?

17:13.119 --> 17:14.319
Come on, you know what I mean.

17:14.520 --> 17:16.887
His people had their moment
and they screwed it up.

17:19.400 --> 17:20.765
I need to talk to him.

17:25.280 --> 17:26.361
OK.

17:26.960 --> 17:28.086
How was shopping?

17:28.160 --> 17:29.880
Did you get me some of
those curly slippers?

17:29.920 --> 17:31.206
No, I tried.

17:32.240 --> 17:34.527
Apparently,
Egyptian men have tiny little feet.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.650
Well, you know what they say?

17:36.720 --> 17:38.688
Tiny feet, tiny shoes.

17:42.040 --> 17:44.850
It is good to have Caro back, though.
She's fun.

17:45.400 --> 17:47.880
Maybe she and Sandy should
come to Luxor, too.

17:47.960 --> 17:49.007
Oh, no.

17:49.280 --> 17:51.123
That is for the lovers.

17:51.680 --> 17:53.967
Baby, I got these new silver earrings
at this souk.

17:54.680 --> 17:55.920
Could you put them in the safe for me?

17:56.000 --> 17:57.680
I don't feel comfortable leaving them out.

17:57.760 --> 17:59.922
Not all Arabs are thieves, darling.

18:00.360 --> 18:01.486
I didn't mean that.

18:02.120 --> 18:04.160
- We always use the safe when we're...
- I'm joking.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.162
They are all thieves. Give 'em here.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.525
Anything unusual happen today?

18:28.800 --> 18:30.484
- Oh, yes.
- What?

18:31.840 --> 18:33.126
I've never been to Cairo, Sandy.

18:33.200 --> 18:35.521
I've never been to Egypt. It's all unusual.

18:35.880 --> 18:36.881
You know what I mean.

18:37.800 --> 18:39.450
Ah, Andrew.

18:39.960 --> 18:41.724
- Feeling lucky?
- Very.

18:42.760 --> 18:44.524
- Caro.
- Dickie.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.650
Right. Well, let's go and roll some dice.

19:01.520 --> 19:03.045
Jed meet with anybody?

19:03.680 --> 19:05.967
- Make a phone call?
- Nothing at all.

19:06.800 --> 19:09.371
I don't know why he's so suspicious.
She's just a silly girl.

19:09.840 --> 19:14.767
Except if she isn't just a silly girl,
that may be exactly how she wants to appear.

19:14.840 --> 19:17.047
- Did you think about that?
- No.

19:17.520 --> 19:19.966
I don't have to think like that.
That's your world.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.643
My world pays for your world.

19:23.440 --> 19:24.601
Don't you forget it.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.405
You can keep Luxor, Dickie.

19:35.880 --> 19:37.245
This is a temple.

19:37.320 --> 19:39.368
You are
an inspiration to us all, Sandy.

19:39.440 --> 19:40.566
I am.

19:59.200 --> 20:00.326
You married?

20:01.120 --> 20:02.246
Uh, no.

20:02.320 --> 20:03.970
- I am married.
- Right.

20:04.040 --> 20:05.644
You want me to sort out a girl for you?

20:06.040 --> 20:07.326
- Easily done.
- Oh, no, no, no.

20:07.400 --> 20:09.448
Thank you. It's, er...

20:09.520 --> 20:11.010
It's fine. Thank you for the offer.

20:12.800 --> 20:14.165
I feel like we have met before.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.120
Is that possible?

20:17.600 --> 20:18.681
Erm...

20:18.760 --> 20:20.808
I don't think so. Er, it's unlikely.

20:23.800 --> 20:25.290
<i>Je suis un gagneur!</i>

20:25.840 --> 20:28.241
I'm gonna play some roulette. Anyone else?

20:28.600 --> 20:30.364
- Sure.
- Good idea.

20:31.120 --> 20:32.645
See which of us is the lucky one.

20:37.520 --> 20:39.090
This one over here.

20:39.840 --> 20:40.841
<i>Madame.</i>

20:43.440 --> 20:44.441
Yes.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.720
- Good luck, darling.
- Thank you.

21:02.800 --> 21:05.485
<i>Les jeux sont faits. Merci.</i>

21:05.560 --> 21:06.800
Thank you. No more bets.

21:13.600 --> 21:15.762
- Drink, Freddie?
- Yes. Whisky.

21:17.760 --> 21:19.640
Can I get
a fresh whisky, please, sir?

21:26.880 --> 21:28.166
He's got it. 2-4-7-6.

21:29.560 --> 21:30.641
All right. Well, I'll go.

21:31.360 --> 21:33.567
No. I'm a pregnant woman. Perfect cover.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.401
Ange, that's not cover.
You are a pregnant woman.

21:39.080 --> 21:40.525
All right.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.801
Well, if you're gonna go, take this.

21:43.880 --> 21:44.927
Bloody hell!

21:45.000 --> 21:46.001
Don't be silly, Joel. I'm English.

21:46.080 --> 21:47.081
If there's a problem, I'll call you.

21:47.160 --> 21:49.360
Ange, I'm not letting you
walk out that door without it.

21:53.760 --> 21:54.841
Thank you.

21:56.160 --> 21:58.160
- You do know how to use that thing, right?
- Oh...

21:59.280 --> 22:01.123
Right. Now. How do I look?

22:01.200 --> 22:03.202
"You look great, Angela." OK.

22:03.920 --> 22:05.600
Look, if there's a problem, I'll call you.

22:08.760 --> 22:10.762
- You look great.
- Oh, give over.

22:19.120 --> 22:21.521
<i>Merci. Rien ne va plus.</i>

22:21.880 --> 22:23.211
- There you are, Freddie.
- Ah.

22:25.400 --> 22:26.401
How're you getting on?

24:43.480 --> 24:44.561
Yeah?

24:44.640 --> 24:45.766
<i>Yeah, hi, I'm in reception.</i>

24:45.840 --> 24:47.729
<i>I have an international package
for Mr Richard Roper.</i>

24:47.800 --> 24:49.086
<i>I need a signature for that.</i>

24:49.800 --> 24:51.560
<i>I'm sorry, sir,
I can't drop it in the lobby.</i>

24:51.600 --> 24:54.524
I need a signature. Thank you.

25:42.360 --> 25:43.760
You should stop, Freddie.

25:43.920 --> 25:46.002
Losing streak never ends until you cut it.

25:46.440 --> 25:47.851
I'll stop when I want.

25:49.720 --> 25:51.768
Ah, I am in this.

25:53.800 --> 25:55.689
Losing in Daddy's casino, Freddie.

25:55.760 --> 25:57.762
That's got to be a metaphor for something.

25:59.840 --> 26:02.002
Let me get you a glass of champagne?

26:02.080 --> 26:03.127
Yes.

26:03.200 --> 26:04.850
Everybody happy?

26:05.000 --> 26:06.047
I never lose.

26:06.200 --> 26:07.361
Up or down, Dickie?

26:08.920 --> 26:10.570
Something's not right, Sandy.

26:11.520 --> 26:12.806
She's trying too hard.

26:14.120 --> 26:15.167
What did Caro say?

26:16.080 --> 26:17.081
She hasn't seen anything.

26:20.960 --> 26:22.121
He's watching me.

26:23.040 --> 26:24.121
I can tell.

26:27.120 --> 26:28.246
Just keep calm.

26:30.400 --> 26:32.482
Could I have two glasses
of champagne, please?

26:34.120 --> 26:35.121
Thank you.

26:37.280 --> 26:39.851
I never lose. OK. No.

26:40.360 --> 26:42.880
- I never lose.
- Freddie, you should stop.

26:43.880 --> 26:45.400
- Whoa...
- You're having fun?

26:45.720 --> 26:46.846
I think it is
time to go home now.

26:46.920 --> 26:48.809
- I don't want to go home.
- I think it's time to go home.

26:48.880 --> 26:50.211
- I think so. I think it's probably best.
- No.

26:50.280 --> 26:51.281
We play over here.

26:53.600 --> 26:54.761
Big day tomorrow.

26:55.400 --> 26:56.561
Go to bed.

26:59.200 --> 27:00.326
OK. It's all right.

27:01.560 --> 27:02.800
All right.

27:03.120 --> 27:04.485
He's just had a bit too much to drink.

27:04.560 --> 27:06.050
- Don't you worry, he will be fine.
- I like you.

27:06.160 --> 27:07.605
- Come with me. I like her.
- Come on now.

27:07.680 --> 27:10.490
- Whoa... This way, this way.
- She can come with me.

27:11.120 --> 27:13.691
- I drive.
- OK.

27:19.160 --> 27:20.605
I think Sandy should go instead, no?

27:27.400 --> 27:28.606
Watch your step now.

27:28.840 --> 27:30.285
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

27:31.320 --> 27:33.721
All right, I think I'll drive, eh?

27:36.480 --> 27:37.481
In you get.

27:38.280 --> 27:39.281
There we go.

27:48.080 --> 27:49.445
Easy. Easy, Freddie.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.889
Whoa, whoa, Freddie.

27:53.720 --> 27:55.200
Now.

27:56.080 --> 27:57.570
- What do you say we sit down, huh?
- Sit down.

27:57.760 --> 28:00.081
- Sit down? Just here?
- Oh, OK.

28:00.920 --> 28:01.921
A-ha.

28:04.160 --> 28:05.360
Where is your family, Freddie?

28:05.720 --> 28:08.246
This isn't the family house.
This one is for business

28:09.320 --> 28:10.321
and pleasure.

28:10.920 --> 28:11.967
No maid?

28:12.040 --> 28:13.724
No, they come in the day.

28:14.480 --> 28:15.720
They come in the day.

28:17.840 --> 28:18.921
Good.

28:19.760 --> 28:21.000
What do you say to a drink, Freddie?

28:21.080 --> 28:22.127
Yes.

28:22.280 --> 28:23.520
- Whisky?
- Yes.

28:26.400 --> 28:27.447
Splash of water OK?

28:27.800 --> 28:28.881
Yes.

28:42.440 --> 28:43.521
There you go.

28:49.840 --> 28:54.641
You know, Freddie, there's, er, something
I've been meaning to ask you.

28:54.720 --> 28:55.960
Hmm?

28:56.040 --> 28:57.883
It's been playing on my mind.

28:59.040 --> 29:01.247
You had a girlfriend called Sophie Alekan

29:02.280 --> 29:03.725
in the Nefertiti Hotel.

29:05.400 --> 29:06.765
Do you remember her?

29:08.320 --> 29:09.731
How do you know about her?

29:09.800 --> 29:11.040
Do you remember her?

29:12.160 --> 29:13.161
Did you kill her?

29:19.880 --> 29:20.881
My God.

29:21.440 --> 29:22.726
I know you.

29:23.440 --> 29:24.487
The night manager.

29:24.560 --> 29:25.641
Did you kill her?

29:26.000 --> 29:27.411
Why do you care? She was a whore.

29:30.040 --> 29:31.371
- Did you kill her?
- Argh.

29:31.440 --> 29:32.646
No.

29:32.720 --> 29:35.291
I was there, but I didn't do it. I swear.

29:35.480 --> 29:36.527
Who did?

29:37.360 --> 29:38.441
One of Roper's men.

29:38.680 --> 29:41.286
Roper said he couldn't
trust her to stay quiet.

29:42.200 --> 29:43.361
Was Roper there?

29:44.120 --> 29:45.406
Was Roper there?

29:46.160 --> 29:50.722
He wanted her to tell
us who had helped her.

29:52.880 --> 29:54.325
But she wouldn't say.

29:55.560 --> 29:56.925
She didn't say a word.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.207
Should not have kept
her mouth closed. Whore!

30:53.800 --> 30:54.926
Excuse me.

30:55.480 --> 30:58.165
Andrew Birch.
I believe you have an envelope for me.

30:58.320 --> 31:01.130
- Yes, sir. From the lady in Room 2104.
- Thank you.

31:08.640 --> 31:10.480
Could you arrange
a car for me tonight, please?

31:26.280 --> 31:27.441
Akhmed.

31:27.600 --> 31:29.080
<i>- Assalam-alaikum.
- Walaikum-assalam.</i>

31:29.560 --> 31:30.561
Let's go.

31:42.840 --> 31:43.966
Go on ahead.

31:46.160 --> 31:47.207
Go on.

31:47.280 --> 31:50.011
But when I went down to the foyer,
there was no parcel.

31:50.440 --> 31:51.885
Check the hotel lists.

31:52.200 --> 31:53.645
Every guest. Get the names to me.

31:54.120 --> 31:55.167
OK.

32:06.280 --> 32:07.441
Andrew Birch.

32:07.560 --> 32:08.846
TradePass Limited.

32:13.120 --> 32:15.646
I'd like to check the shipment
that's leaving tomorrow, please.

32:32.240 --> 32:33.241
<i>Shukraan.</i>

33:04.200 --> 33:05.611
OK, now, guys. Go, quick.

33:08.360 --> 33:09.646
Go, go, go!

33:32.320 --> 33:33.481
OK. So you know what to do?

33:35.840 --> 33:36.966
This is the number.

33:37.600 --> 33:38.726
You must memorise it.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.446
And you press connect
and it will start the party.

33:44.960 --> 33:46.720
- Thank you, Akhmed.
- Any time. My pleasure.

33:51.120 --> 33:52.849
This is because of Miss Alekan, right?

33:56.320 --> 33:57.401
Yes.

33:59.680 --> 34:00.681
And no.

34:03.440 --> 34:04.930
I'll see you, brother.

34:05.800 --> 34:06.961
You take care, brother.

34:32.960 --> 34:35.406
Breakfast, madam.
Compliments of Mr Birch.

34:35.840 --> 34:36.887
Thank you.

34:39.760 --> 34:40.886
You're welcome.

35:07.920 --> 35:09.206
Oh, dear.

35:10.480 --> 35:14.007
It's hard keeping track of all those codes
and PIN numbers, isn't it?

35:14.480 --> 35:15.811
Have you tried your birthday?

35:17.640 --> 35:18.801
I just found this...

35:18.880 --> 35:20.041
Oh, Jemima.

35:22.560 --> 35:25.166
You let someone break in here
and steal from me.

35:26.760 --> 35:29.206
The question is, who?

35:32.840 --> 35:34.444
Please don't tell me it was Corky.

35:34.720 --> 35:36.085
Because I might not believe you.

35:42.920 --> 35:43.967
Morning, Frisky.

35:44.840 --> 35:46.600
Would you mind stepping
in here for a moment?

35:58.160 --> 35:59.889
Yes, this is Andrew Birch.

36:02.120 --> 36:03.326
Of course, sir.

36:53.400 --> 36:54.686
Come on, darling.

36:55.960 --> 36:57.200
Be a good girl.

37:00.640 --> 37:02.404
No point in thinking he's going to stop.

37:03.520 --> 37:05.204
Frisky never stops.

37:29.680 --> 37:30.727
You know,

37:30.880 --> 37:33.360
I never really thought you had it in you.

37:33.760 --> 37:34.966
You know what I think?

37:35.880 --> 37:39.168
I think you must care very deeply
about the person you're protecting.

37:42.120 --> 37:44.441
I saw you look at him. In the casino.

37:45.200 --> 37:46.281
How close you are.

38:05.880 --> 38:07.120
<i>Dromgoole speaking.</i>

38:07.440 --> 38:08.560
Did you get what I sent you?

38:09.840 --> 38:11.126
<i>You know what I think, Geoffrey?</i>

38:11.920 --> 38:13.649
<i>When we open those crates tomorrow</i>

38:13.720 --> 38:18.328
<i>I don't think we're going to find
farm machinery inside. Do you?</i>

38:21.000 --> 38:22.809
It doesn't look good for you, Geoffrey.

38:26.880 --> 38:27.881
What do you want?

38:28.320 --> 38:30.322
Stay away from the Egyptian affairs.

38:31.240 --> 38:33.766
If Roper tries to get in contact,
cut him off.

38:34.120 --> 38:35.167
<i>No safety net.</i>

38:35.800 --> 38:37.211
<i>You don't even take his call.</i>

38:38.840 --> 38:39.841
What do I get?

38:42.800 --> 38:44.768
You get to survive, Geoffrey.

38:57.760 --> 38:58.807
Morning, Andrew.

38:59.480 --> 39:00.720
My, you look spiffy.

39:01.160 --> 39:02.241
Ready to go?

39:02.760 --> 39:03.966
When you are, sir.

39:04.200 --> 39:05.486
How was the casino?

39:05.880 --> 39:07.370
Very successful night.

39:07.520 --> 39:08.760
I am a winner.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.571
I can't get hold of Freddie.
He should be here by now.

39:12.960 --> 39:14.450
You put him to bed, didn't you?

39:14.600 --> 39:16.250
Left him sleeping like a baby, sir.

39:16.640 --> 39:17.880
Never mind. His loss.

39:45.720 --> 39:47.848
Hello, Mr Roper.
The trucks are loaded.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.331
Everything is waiting for you.

39:49.560 --> 39:50.561
Thank you.

40:11.560 --> 40:12.561
Dickie.

40:13.120 --> 40:15.327
I've just been through the hotel list
of the medical delegation.

40:15.400 --> 40:16.890
All names check except two.

40:17.440 --> 40:19.044
They're in room 2104.

40:21.040 --> 40:23.088
All right. Call Frisky,
get him to clean it up.

40:25.760 --> 40:26.841
Andrew!

40:27.800 --> 40:29.962
Let me show you the hospitality area.

40:31.720 --> 40:32.767
It's me.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.843
He's asked for room service in 2104.

40:37.440 --> 40:39.169
Yeah. OK.

40:39.840 --> 40:41.001
Understood.

40:45.160 --> 40:46.161
Ah, well.

40:48.280 --> 40:52.649
It seems that you and I
are going for a little walk.

40:53.480 --> 40:55.767
When I tell you, you are going to get up,

40:56.680 --> 40:57.966
we'll wash your face

40:58.560 --> 40:59.800
and maybe get you dressed.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.525
But you are gonna be very quiet.

41:04.880 --> 41:06.086
Get up!

41:28.360 --> 41:29.920
I'll take your phone if you don't mind.

41:32.320 --> 41:33.401
Sure.

41:37.040 --> 41:38.041
Ah!

41:45.800 --> 41:48.081
Search him for weapons,
make sure he's not wearing a wire.

41:53.880 --> 41:56.929
It's a very rare thing, Jonathan Pine,

41:57.600 --> 41:58.806
for me to trust a person.

42:00.120 --> 42:01.201
But you were special.

42:02.120 --> 42:03.929
I knew it the first moment I saw you.

42:04.840 --> 42:06.649
Saved my son. Risked your life.

42:08.920 --> 42:10.440
Should have known something was wrong.

42:13.760 --> 42:15.320
I don't know what you're talking about.

42:15.400 --> 42:16.686
Corky knew it, of course.

42:18.560 --> 42:20.130
Tried to make me see.

42:20.520 --> 42:21.726
Poor old Corks.

42:22.240 --> 42:23.526
You killed him, I suppose.

42:24.320 --> 42:25.401
To save your own skin.

42:26.360 --> 42:27.521
Yes?

42:29.600 --> 42:31.011
He was a good man, Corks.

42:31.160 --> 42:32.400
Loyal man.

42:33.120 --> 42:36.090
Now he is lying in a ditch
on a Turkish mountain because of you.

42:37.800 --> 42:39.928
Well, for his sake and for mine,

42:40.800 --> 42:44.009
I can promise you that your death
is going to be a hundred times worse.

42:48.280 --> 42:49.406
Who are you working with?

42:53.040 --> 42:54.041
No one.

42:54.720 --> 42:56.404
Well, that's not true. For starters,

42:57.800 --> 42:59.086
I know you're working with Jed.

43:00.680 --> 43:01.840
That's a mistake, by the way.

43:03.640 --> 43:05.244
Not the sort of thing a man does.

43:12.120 --> 43:13.360
You sick fuck.

43:19.280 --> 43:20.361
Ah, ah, ah...

43:20.960 --> 43:22.769
We need that pretty face for the buyers.

43:25.320 --> 43:27.527
We can make sure
that nothing else happens to her,

43:27.720 --> 43:29.051
if you cooperate.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.047
Did you kill Freddie?

43:37.320 --> 43:39.004
You would have killed me, obviously.

43:43.560 --> 43:45.369
I got you so wrong.

43:55.120 --> 43:56.121
Now, listen.

43:56.320 --> 43:58.448
Jed is in a very bad way.

43:59.160 --> 44:02.130
And I'm not feeling particularly
sentimental about her welfare.

44:02.720 --> 44:07.521
Her life depends on the quality of your
performance in the next half-hour.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.650
So smile.

44:23.520 --> 44:24.601
Joel? Where are you?

44:25.080 --> 44:26.525
I'm outside the loading area.

44:36.440 --> 44:37.487
Oh, my God, Ange!

44:37.560 --> 44:39.927
<i>Get out of there. Pine's blown.
So you're blown. Get out!</i>

44:40.000 --> 44:41.001
Can you see him? Is he all right?

44:41.160 --> 44:42.525
Ange, listen to me! Pine is blown!

44:42.600 --> 44:43.726
<i>Get the hell out of there.</i>

44:50.680 --> 44:51.761
Room service.

44:55.520 --> 44:56.601
Room service.

45:24.240 --> 45:25.401
Get out! Go on! Go!

45:25.480 --> 45:26.561
Argh! You bitch...

45:26.840 --> 45:28.080
Go. Get out. Get out.

45:29.880 --> 45:30.927
You bloody bitch!

45:39.280 --> 45:41.726
Mr Kouyami. Sorry to keep you.

45:42.480 --> 45:44.369
- Are you well?
- How are you?

45:44.560 --> 45:45.686
Good, thank you.

45:46.560 --> 45:49.404
Today marks the beginning
of a new trade route, Mr Roper.

45:49.480 --> 45:51.240
And the beginning of a
beautiful friendship,

45:51.360 --> 45:52.441
to coin a phrase.

45:52.680 --> 45:54.489
- Mr Birch.
- Mr Barghati.

45:54.640 --> 45:56.404
- How are you?
- Very well, thank you.

45:57.320 --> 46:00.210
As you can see, the trucks are loaded
with the spec as agreed.

46:00.680 --> 46:03.684
The drivers are ready to take them
to the destination of your choosing.

46:03.960 --> 46:05.007
Er, Jasper.

46:05.080 --> 46:06.286
Yes, sir?

46:06.680 --> 46:09.490
- Get them rolling, will you?
- Yes, sir. Let's go!

46:10.440 --> 46:12.522
Where is Mr Hamid?

46:14.000 --> 46:17.322
I'm afraid Freddie was a little bit
of a bad boy last night.

46:17.400 --> 46:19.360
I think he might be
paying the price this morning.

46:20.680 --> 46:22.887
We can make a start without him
if you are content.

46:22.960 --> 46:25.486
I suggest we process
the second half of the payment.

46:27.200 --> 46:28.281
I am entirely content.

46:28.920 --> 46:30.046
Good.

46:30.360 --> 46:31.691
Mr Barghati, after you.

46:40.240 --> 46:41.321
Beautiful day for it.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.081
The best.

46:53.120 --> 46:54.121
Please check.

46:54.200 --> 46:55.326
Thank you.

46:58.400 --> 47:01.051
Yes, good morning.
It's Sandy Langbourne here.

47:01.120 --> 47:02.690
TradePass. For authorisation.

47:07.680 --> 47:11.162
Mr Birch will now complete the transaction.

47:12.640 --> 47:13.641
Won't you, Mr Birch?

47:18.000 --> 47:19.570
Don't mess it up, Andrew.

47:19.640 --> 47:22.530
Lot of people depending
on that beautiful little iris of yours.

47:30.240 --> 47:31.287
Come on, Andrew.

47:31.640 --> 47:32.721
We haven't got all day.

47:46.120 --> 47:47.960
What's going on, Jasper?
Why have they stopped?

47:48.000 --> 47:49.001
I don't know, sir.

47:52.480 --> 47:53.527
What?

48:04.720 --> 48:05.721
Jesus.

48:29.400 --> 48:31.084
I want my money back, Mr Roper.

48:40.440 --> 48:41.680
Mr Roper.

48:46.760 --> 48:49.366
You. Transfer my money right now.

48:50.840 --> 48:51.887
Dickie.

48:52.720 --> 48:53.881
Where's the first payment?

48:54.480 --> 48:56.280
There should be $300
million already in here.

48:59.480 --> 49:01.084
Oh, you beauty.

49:03.240 --> 49:04.640
Did you hear me, Mr Roper?

49:04.800 --> 49:06.370
I want my money. Now!

49:06.520 --> 49:08.124
We better leave. We mustn't be seen...

49:08.200 --> 49:10.521
I want the full amount returned to me.

49:10.880 --> 49:12.006
Do you understand?

49:12.960 --> 49:14.405
If you do not pay,

49:15.560 --> 49:17.085
there will be consequences.

49:18.200 --> 49:20.441
Don't you dare threaten me!

49:20.880 --> 49:22.245
Who do you think did this?

49:23.200 --> 49:26.283
Arab militia!
Little brown rats like the rest of you!

49:27.360 --> 49:29.328
You'll get your money
when I'm good and ready!

49:29.880 --> 49:30.881
Understand?

49:38.640 --> 49:39.926
We better leave.

49:40.000 --> 49:41.001
<i>Yalla.</i>

49:41.080 --> 49:43.048
- Gentlemen.
- Let's go.

49:43.160 --> 49:46.050
- Let us reconvene in the Nefertiti in one hour.
- Let's go.

49:46.160 --> 49:50.529
Our organisation is used to dealing with
problems like this, we can deal with it.

49:50.600 --> 49:51.647
Dickie, we need to go.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.001
Pine!

49:57.400 --> 49:59.448
Jed. You let Jed go, you get the money.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.367
You'd buy that girl for $300 million?

50:22.600 --> 50:25.809
Call the airfield. Tell them to
have the jet ready in one hour.

50:30.480 --> 50:31.925
Boss, maybe the back entrance?

50:32.240 --> 50:33.287
Yes.

50:51.320 --> 50:52.480
They come to the room.

50:52.840 --> 50:53.921
You transfer the money.

50:54.400 --> 50:55.845
I let Jed go.

50:56.200 --> 50:57.281
Clear?

51:02.200 --> 51:03.326
We've not been introduced.

51:03.400 --> 51:04.686
My name's Angela Burr.

51:07.400 --> 51:08.526
Dickie Roper.

51:10.960 --> 51:12.883
Where's Jed, if you don't mind me asking?

51:13.960 --> 51:15.246
She's downstairs, Jonathan.

51:17.240 --> 51:20.722
All yours. Dickie.

51:23.080 --> 51:24.320
This is pathetic.

51:26.360 --> 51:27.486
Who the hell are you?

51:28.280 --> 51:30.567
- I'm Angela...
- I know your name.

51:30.840 --> 51:33.121
I mean, who are you really,
in the grand scheme of things?

51:33.480 --> 51:35.482
Oh, in the grand scheme of things?

51:35.560 --> 51:36.880
Don't know. I live in Bermondsey.

51:38.520 --> 51:40.249
<i>- This is London...</i>
- This is Dickie Roper.

51:40.320 --> 51:41.321
Get me Halo.

51:45.440 --> 51:47.442
There is no Halo at this number, sir.

51:48.880 --> 51:50.086
Don't be a tit.

51:50.320 --> 51:52.607
Geoffrey Dromgoole
gave me this number personally.

51:53.840 --> 51:55.808
I'm afraid I'm unable to help you.

52:05.160 --> 52:06.685
Aw. No joy?

52:07.560 --> 52:09.289
Must be a peculiar feeling, is it?

52:09.800 --> 52:12.451
All those VIP rooms, five-star hotels.

52:12.520 --> 52:14.568
You're now on the wrong side
of the velvet rope.

52:15.360 --> 52:16.930
Do you feel quite discombobulated?

52:19.720 --> 52:21.640
I suppose you've been
preparing this for a while.

52:23.200 --> 52:24.920
Practising in front of the mirror, have we?

52:25.320 --> 52:26.321
Yeah.

52:27.640 --> 52:29.927
Since the sports day in Kurdistan.

52:30.920 --> 52:32.684
I always thought those kids
could do with more protection.

52:32.760 --> 52:34.125
So that's what's happening now.

52:34.200 --> 52:35.770
Me and Jonathan. We're protecting them.

52:36.600 --> 52:38.170
Not the ones you've already killed,

52:38.480 --> 52:40.084
obviously, but the next ones.

52:41.160 --> 52:43.447
Protecting from what? From me?

52:44.480 --> 52:45.686
I never killed anyone.

52:46.240 --> 52:50.564
I never stole, never fiddled my taxes.
All I did was work for a company.

52:50.840 --> 52:53.002
Owned and operated by
your little Pinocchio.

52:53.800 --> 52:56.610
I might get a 50 quid fine.

52:57.360 --> 52:59.806
With a bit of luck,
they'll let me pay in instalments.

53:00.160 --> 53:01.491
Yeah. You're probably right.

53:02.160 --> 53:03.969
Government lawyers, useless, aren't they?

53:04.560 --> 53:05.686
I was one once.

53:07.320 --> 53:08.526
Right. So...

53:12.280 --> 53:13.725
Mr Roper.

53:14.080 --> 53:15.127
The same.

53:15.360 --> 53:16.885
Not a painting. How can I help you?

53:16.960 --> 53:19.247
These gentlemen are here
to place you under arrest.

53:20.080 --> 53:21.491
Really. For what?

53:22.000 --> 53:26.369
Uh, contravention of Egyptian import rules,
conspiracy to murder.

53:29.440 --> 53:31.090
And do these clowns have names?

53:31.400 --> 53:34.244
Because I'm sure Mr Hamid, Sr
would love to know what they are.

53:34.520 --> 53:36.602
Mr Hamid is a very good chum of mine.

53:37.320 --> 53:38.481
Chum?

53:38.880 --> 53:39.961
By this time tomorrow,

53:40.040 --> 53:42.088
I'm going to be back
in my humble croft in Majorca,

53:42.160 --> 53:43.810
sipping a 30-year-old Scotch.

53:44.440 --> 53:45.771
It's a possibility.

53:46.440 --> 53:47.487
I hope not.

53:47.560 --> 53:48.607
By the way.

53:49.360 --> 53:50.566
Good luck with the baby.

53:50.760 --> 53:53.491
It's a wonderful thing,
to bring a child into this world.

54:26.720 --> 54:28.006
Why did you do it, Jonathan?

54:30.240 --> 54:31.366
You have to commit.

54:34.640 --> 54:36.165
You have to make a decision.

54:41.640 --> 54:43.768
Couldn't just scratch my nose, could you?

54:45.760 --> 54:46.761
See you in a few days.

55:08.160 --> 55:09.366
What the hell's going on here?

55:09.600 --> 55:10.601
I've got no idea.

55:17.560 --> 55:19.449
Hey, wait a minute!

55:20.040 --> 55:21.280
Wait a minute!

55:25.520 --> 55:26.681
Wait a second.

55:42.160 --> 55:43.161
He deserves it.

55:57.000 --> 55:59.685
No! No! No!

56:00.320 --> 56:01.367
No!

56:02.080 --> 56:03.081
No!

56:29.960 --> 56:31.166
What time do you land?

56:33.120 --> 56:34.246
6:00 a.m.

56:35.640 --> 56:37.290
Bright and early.

56:41.560 --> 56:42.960
There be someone there to meet you?

56:43.920 --> 56:45.480
I think they'll all be there.

56:51.000 --> 56:52.525
I keep thinking,

56:53.680 --> 56:55.170
what if he doesn't recognise me?

56:57.080 --> 56:58.730
A son always recognises his mother.

57:02.560 --> 57:04.801
And if he doesn't, I'll tell him.

57:05.240 --> 57:06.480
Okay?

57:11.880 --> 57:13.160
You can come visit soon, though.

57:16.120 --> 57:17.645
I promise.

57:42.640 --> 57:44.051
Be good.

57:48.440 --> 57:50.249
You're a funny fish, Jonathan.

57:53.600 --> 57:55.887
- I know.
- Good.

58:35.560 --> 58:37.369
Is there anything I can do for you, sir?

58:40.440 --> 58:42.886
No, thank you.

58:45.320 --> 58:46.526
Nothing at all.

58:47.305 --> 58:53.393
