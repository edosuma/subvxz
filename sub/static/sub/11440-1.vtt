WEBVTT

01:21.998 --> 01:25.125
- Hey, Will.
- Did you take care of that tab, Bobby?

01:25.168 --> 01:30.506
First thing Wednesday after I get paid,
Will. First thing Wednesday, I promise.

02:47.083 --> 02:49.418
Some bad motherfuckin' shit there.

03:11.274 --> 03:18.113
You're listening to Rock'n'Roll Radio
on the last three days of the year 1974.

03:18.573 --> 03:22.159
A year in which we saw Watergate
go down, Patty Hearst get abducted,

03:22.243 --> 03:25.913
and Hank Aaron beat Babe Ruth's record.

03:25.955 --> 03:30.125
Here's something to bridge the gap
between '74 and the New Year.

03:46.267 --> 03:48.352
You son of a bitch.

03:51.773 --> 03:54.149
Hey, man. I just wanted in out of the cold.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.361
You came real close this time, Pancho.

04:59.841 --> 05:03.218
Speaking of the devil,
Mr. Raynor just walked in the door.

05:10.226 --> 05:12.561
Well, he's right here. Right.

05:12.603 --> 05:14.396
Jimmy.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.983
Hold on there, boy. We got things to do.

05:18.067 --> 05:21.236
- Will you leave me alone?
- Gotta be, Jimmy.

05:21.279 --> 05:22.696
Can't you see I'm bleeding?

05:22.739 --> 05:25.991
Nettle says it's time to sacrifice a virgin.

05:27.660 --> 05:32.539
If you listen to everything Nettle says, you
end up mowing the grass in December.

05:33.249 --> 05:37.794
The man ain't reasonable, but you go
along with him, or go someplace else.

05:38.921 --> 05:40.964
That's the choice.

05:41.424 --> 05:46.595
Right now we gotta go pick you out
a partner, separate him from the flock.

05:53.227 --> 05:55.937
- There's one.
- Which one?

05:57.940 --> 06:01.485
That nice-lookin' boy, right there.

06:03.279 --> 06:07.616
Shit, Dodd. He ain't nice-lookin'.
He looks just like you.

06:09.285 --> 06:11.787
Maybe 100 years ago.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.955
Nothin' the matter with that.

06:17.126 --> 06:18.668
What do you think?

06:18.753 --> 06:22.714
Grow him some long hair and borrow him
some of your clothes, he'd be just right.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.469
Jimmy, what do you think?

06:29.305 --> 06:32.307
I think it's too fucking cold
to be running in circles.

06:32.350 --> 06:34.893
Could be worse, man. Could be us.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.399
There, you see there?

06:40.775 --> 06:43.485
I bet you five dollars
he wears that skinny boy down

06:43.569 --> 06:45.654
and beats him by 50 yards.

06:54.122 --> 06:56.164
Girl beats 'em both.

06:58.793 --> 07:04.506
Might oughta told you he won the 220
for Katterly High School a few years back.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.637
Jesus.

07:19.313 --> 07:24.901
Sixty-two, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67.

07:24.986 --> 07:28.488
All right. Good race.
All right. Y'all got 10 minutes...

07:32.869 --> 07:38.081
- She got an edge to her, don't she?
- Jimmy, the girl ran track somewhere.

07:38.166 --> 07:41.418
That doesn't mean
you want her watchin' your back.

07:43.254 --> 07:47.340
Nettle ain't gonna wanna put her
in with you. I'll tell you that right now.

07:47.383 --> 07:50.218
First thing he's gonna think
is you'll bang her.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.929
You know how he is about that.

07:53.014 --> 07:58.059
The second thing he thinks, if she gets
hurt, how's it make the department look?

08:01.230 --> 08:04.232
Throwin' a little girl like that
into the world.

08:04.317 --> 08:08.653
- I can just hear what he's gonna say.
- She looks stout to me.

08:13.034 --> 08:15.202
Pull her out and talk to her for me.

08:18.331 --> 08:23.502
- I gotta call Nettle and see what he says.
- It's not Nettle's ass. It's mine.

08:31.344 --> 08:34.763
- You don't have to do this, you know.
- I know.

08:34.847 --> 08:37.765
It isn't gonna be the way you think it is.

08:37.850 --> 08:41.061
- It gets ugly.
- Yes, sir. I know.

08:41.102 --> 08:43.145
No, you don't know.

08:43.231 --> 08:45.273
You get ugly with it.

08:47.944 --> 08:50.487
What d'you ever wanna
do this for, anyway?

08:50.571 --> 08:53.198
Seems like a chance to make a difference.

08:53.991 --> 08:57.118
I'll tell you what's gonna be different. You.

09:11.801 --> 09:14.970
Miss Cates, this is Jim Raynor.

09:15.012 --> 09:16.638
He was pretty himself once.

09:18.307 --> 09:19.641
Yeah.

09:20.184 --> 09:21.393
How do you do?

09:22.562 --> 09:23.979
Let's take a ride.

10:05.563 --> 10:10.233
It does that by itself.
It gets cold, it just falls down on its own.

10:10.318 --> 10:13.653
- Summertime it works perfect, though.
- That's convenient.

10:23.331 --> 10:25.165
Broke in Montana.

10:25.207 --> 10:29.336
I kept meaning to get it fixed.
Then I came down here, where it's warm.

10:31.172 --> 10:33.340
And I lost my motivation.

10:33.382 --> 10:36.301
Is that where you're from? Montana?

10:36.385 --> 10:38.386
The eastern part.

10:38.429 --> 10:40.055
The "Big Empty".

10:41.557 --> 10:45.018
But now I'm from Katterly, Texas.

10:47.438 --> 10:49.064
Were you a narc up there, too?

10:49.106 --> 10:51.232
Ruins you for anything else.

10:53.194 --> 10:55.236
That's probably not a joke.

11:19.929 --> 11:22.597
So was that bullshit on your application?

11:22.640 --> 11:25.433
- Coupla joints in high school?
- What?

11:25.559 --> 11:30.021
Your application. It said you'd done
two joints in high school. That was it?

11:30.106 --> 11:32.982
That's it, except once in junior college.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.818
It was a Catholic school.

11:44.662 --> 11:46.955
We're just talkin' now, you and me.

12:41.010 --> 12:43.595
That's not bad.

12:43.679 --> 12:47.015
Most people pull off to the right at first.
You're steady.

12:47.099 --> 12:48.475
Thank you.

12:55.024 --> 12:57.650
Why'd you ask me that about high school?

12:58.277 --> 13:01.362
'Cause I'm still trying to decide
if I wanna get you into this.

13:01.864 --> 13:05.200
It's a long haul,
and you hate yourself most of the way.

13:05.242 --> 13:07.327
- Is that how you live?
- No.

13:08.370 --> 13:10.705
It's simpler than that for me.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.874
But then I got low self-esteem.

13:19.381 --> 13:21.841
I still can't believe I have to move.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.968
Thank you.

13:26.055 --> 13:28.932
- Gotta do something about your hair.
- What?

13:30.059 --> 13:32.101
Quit washin' it.

13:33.729 --> 13:36.606
There are some things we gotta talk over.

13:36.690 --> 13:37.732
Okay.

13:43.531 --> 13:46.658
We buy drugs.

13:46.742 --> 13:49.410
Larry Dodd gives us the money.

13:49.453 --> 13:53.581
And he's the only one we ever talk to
in the whole department.

13:53.624 --> 13:56.376
To everybody else, we're junkies.

13:57.378 --> 14:01.464
What that means
is if we get into something,

14:01.549 --> 14:04.634
we ain't gonna call in
no "Officer assist" to get out.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.637
Our "Officer assist" is each other.

14:09.390 --> 14:13.935
So, what I'm saying is when you
come into this it can't be halfway.

14:14.603 --> 14:16.312
I didn't think it was.

14:16.397 --> 14:18.398
You know what you're doin'?

14:18.858 --> 14:20.942
Yeah.

14:21.527 --> 14:23.903
Gotta be able to lie better than that.

14:26.615 --> 14:28.783
I can do what it takes.

14:35.082 --> 14:37.375
Let's see you roll one.

14:37.459 --> 14:39.294
Okay.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.834
You wanna try to light that up?

15:33.140 --> 15:37.101
You do that on the street,
I guarantee you're fucked.

15:37.186 --> 15:39.187
You're fucked.

15:39.271 --> 15:41.898
And I'm fucked with you,
'cause we're partners.

15:42.775 --> 15:47.362
- It's simulation.
- Simulation's something you say in court.

15:47.404 --> 15:49.697
Outside the court we're here to buy dope.

15:49.782 --> 15:55.411
You go in thinkin' these people are stupid,
it'll get you hurt, and me hurt with you.

15:55.704 --> 15:59.999
That's what happens when the shit comes
down, one of us is fucked, we both are.

16:00.042 --> 16:03.753
And that's what this is about. You and me.

16:04.046 --> 16:09.384
'Cause people find out what we do, I mean
either side, the DA or the dealers, it's over.

16:10.219 --> 16:11.302
Over.

16:14.306 --> 16:17.558
All we got is each other.

16:20.062 --> 16:22.188
All right.

16:49.758 --> 16:51.634
- How you doin'?
- All right.

16:52.386 --> 16:54.262
Hey, baby.

16:56.181 --> 16:59.767
- How 'bout a couple of longnecks?
- Jimmy! Where you been?

16:59.810 --> 17:02.770
I've been around. Been around.

17:02.813 --> 17:05.106
- This here's my friend, Kris.
- Hey.

17:18.119 --> 17:21.955
Listen, we were wonderin'
if maybe you could get us some toot.

17:22.040 --> 17:25.835
I might, but not here.
Will's turned paranoid.

17:26.962 --> 17:30.423
Okay. Whenever. You just let me know.

18:00.829 --> 18:03.164
- Where did we meet?
- Houston, two years ago.

18:03.207 --> 18:06.626
I worked in an ice-cream parlor
and you ran a Pizza Hut.

18:07.044 --> 18:09.170
- Where am I from?
- Montana.

18:11.340 --> 18:14.550
I don't know why
I have to come from an ice-cream parlor.

18:15.719 --> 18:20.014
Because the closer to the truth it is,
the easier it is to remember.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.266
But you never worked for Pizza Hut.

18:22.351 --> 18:24.644
No. But I ate there a lot.

18:25.938 --> 18:30.358
- Where did we get our money?
- Insurance. Old woman ran into your car.

18:31.693 --> 18:34.195
You know what this is, right?

18:36.698 --> 18:39.742
It's gonna come up sooner or later.
Might as well be sooner.

18:43.664 --> 18:46.040
- Can you handle this?
- Yeah.

18:47.334 --> 18:48.709
What?

18:49.711 --> 18:51.754
I'm gonna put a needle in my arm.

19:03.058 --> 19:04.725
This is called cooking.

19:05.394 --> 19:07.770
Okay, you cook heroin.
You don't cook coke.

19:07.855 --> 19:11.232
Some people cook speed.
Mostly they don't.

19:30.419 --> 19:32.628
Okay.

19:32.713 --> 19:35.339
Ready to run.

19:35.424 --> 19:38.134
You wanna let it cool first.

19:38.218 --> 19:40.595
Shoot now, you'll parboil your heart.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.598
Let me have your belt.

19:57.779 --> 20:00.781
You do this with a dealer,
you let him go first.

20:00.866 --> 20:03.492
Or your snitch,
you make the snitch go first.

20:03.577 --> 20:05.703
Hot shot, fast as a bullet.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.956
Okay, take it off.

20:21.136 --> 20:22.720
So there it is.

20:23.680 --> 20:26.474
- What's in there, anyway?
- Baby laxative.

20:26.516 --> 20:30.311
- Come on. You can't put that in your vein.
- In a spot, I might.

20:30.354 --> 20:32.647
Makes you piss like a racehorse.

20:33.649 --> 20:36.484
But it looks a little like speed. It'd pass.

20:46.036 --> 20:48.496
- I'm gonna go wash this up.
- Okay.

21:39.673 --> 21:41.924
Listen, I know this is a little hairy.

21:42.551 --> 21:45.886
- I'm not scared.
- It happens.

21:47.431 --> 21:51.183
All this shit about addiction is
a matter of how strong you are.

21:51.226 --> 21:53.352
I've seen agents brought up for air.

21:53.395 --> 21:58.149
They've been doin' it steady
five, six months, plenty strung out.

21:58.233 --> 22:00.401
Gotta get strong.

22:00.485 --> 22:04.071
You kick the bed covers a week or two,
you run a little temperature.

22:04.114 --> 22:06.866
You get up on your feet, stand and walk.

22:06.908 --> 22:09.410
- Cops?
- That's how it's done.

22:09.494 --> 22:13.664
A fuckin' dealer won't split down
with nobody till he knows he's cool.

22:13.749 --> 22:15.958
Business.

22:16.043 --> 22:18.252
That's the way it is.

22:38.231 --> 22:40.858
You gonna need a ride home later?

22:42.194 --> 22:44.320
No, man. I'll get a ride.

22:45.530 --> 22:47.281
See ya.

23:29.908 --> 23:31.534
I got an itch

23:33.203 --> 23:35.996
And I don't know where to scratch

23:38.375 --> 23:40.876
Come on, baby

23:40.961 --> 23:42.294
Scratch my back

23:45.132 --> 23:47.425
What's up, man? You all right?

23:47.509 --> 23:50.511
That feels so good

23:57.561 --> 24:00.688
Now we've got some chicken scratch

24:03.066 --> 24:04.984
Okay

24:09.364 --> 24:11.449
Get up

24:15.036 --> 24:17.621
Yeah

24:21.376 --> 24:24.211
- Mr. Walker.
- How you doin'?

24:24.254 --> 24:26.338
- Kris.
- Hi, Kris.

24:28.508 --> 24:33.095
You remember that Blue Hawaiian
last week? That's the guy who had it.

24:33.180 --> 24:35.681
- Yeah, that's me.
- That was good.

24:37.601 --> 24:40.895
A little of that Hawaiian now
could make a person waterproof.

24:42.147 --> 24:45.774
- I got some more, if you're interested.
- Always.

24:45.901 --> 24:48.194
A quarter-pound?

24:48.236 --> 24:50.362
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

24:50.947 --> 24:54.825
- Wouldn't have any of that other stuff?
- What, that white stuff?

24:54.910 --> 24:57.369
Yeah, man. I got some of that.

24:57.412 --> 25:00.289
You wanna go and get it?
Come on, let's go.

25:04.085 --> 25:06.086
Come on, man. I'll drive.

25:20.268 --> 25:25.272
- Didn't know you drove a Caddy, Walker.
- Yeah. I had a few of 'em, you know.

25:42.916 --> 25:44.959
Jimmy.

25:53.134 --> 25:54.552
Stuff's all right?

25:56.096 --> 25:57.137
It's all right.

26:00.225 --> 26:04.144
Krissie, why don't you come over here?
Let me fix you a bump. Sit down.

26:05.438 --> 26:06.689
Great.

26:15.657 --> 26:19.493
- There you go.
- Thank you.

26:19.536 --> 26:25.249
I got this stuff here from a man
who stuffs deer for a livin'.

26:26.334 --> 26:27.918
This is a screwy world.

26:46.479 --> 26:48.564
Last call, Jimmy.

26:50.066 --> 26:52.151
I think we're about skunked.

26:53.153 --> 26:55.696
Unless you got somethin' besides beer.

26:58.033 --> 27:01.368
I can't now. Will's still out back.

27:10.253 --> 27:11.545
You all right?

27:13.632 --> 27:15.716
I still can't believe I did that.

27:17.260 --> 27:19.803
It just went so natural.

27:21.556 --> 27:23.432
You were good.

27:25.393 --> 27:30.230
If nothin' else, the boy deserves
some slack for havin' such jam-up drugs.

27:32.192 --> 27:34.777
But he's gotta stop stealin' these cars.

27:40.241 --> 27:41.408
Will Gaines.

27:45.246 --> 27:49.083
Mr. Will Gaines just might be
the biggest dealer in Katterly.

27:50.919 --> 27:53.879
Then again, he might not.

27:53.963 --> 27:57.091
Nettle wants him
the way most guys want pussy.

27:58.551 --> 28:00.969
It's all he ever thinks about.

28:01.054 --> 28:03.430
- Why?
- I don't know.

28:03.515 --> 28:06.725
The chief's a deacon
at the Church of the Savior.

28:07.727 --> 28:10.938
Mr. Gaines owns this bar, the Driller's,

28:11.022 --> 28:15.776
the bookstore peep shows
out on the highway west o' town.

28:16.778 --> 28:19.279
I'd say the chief sees him as the Devil.

28:21.491 --> 28:25.994
Chief Nettle tends to see things
in fundamentalist terms.

28:27.747 --> 28:29.957
One of those.

28:49.310 --> 28:53.731
As you all know, I took over the job
of chief of police six months ago.

28:53.815 --> 28:58.152
- Acting chief of police.
- Acting chief of police, yes, sir.

28:58.403 --> 29:03.365
At that time I had a cursory knowledge of
the volume of drug trafficking in the city.

29:06.035 --> 29:10.289
This syringe was found two weeks ago
on a playground at Lamar Junior High.

29:12.459 --> 29:15.127
A high-school teacher
took this off a sophomore.

29:19.257 --> 29:23.677
This here came off a little colored boy
who was selling marijuana to his friends.

29:23.720 --> 29:27.848
I believe we've seen enough now to
appreciate your point, Acting Chief Nettle.

29:28.933 --> 29:32.895
With all respect, sir, I think
the people of Katterly need to know

29:32.979 --> 29:37.065
what their children are facing when they
send them off to school in the morning.

29:46.868 --> 29:48.744
Man.

29:50.288 --> 29:52.790
You said you wanted some brown.

29:55.877 --> 29:58.212
There it is.

29:59.172 --> 30:01.256
I like to relax, you know.

30:03.551 --> 30:05.636
Like, I don't know you.

30:08.556 --> 30:11.058
But I like to relax, you know.

30:12.811 --> 30:17.022
So you best be showing me
you ain't the man.

30:25.073 --> 30:27.157
Hey, handsome.

30:27.242 --> 30:29.952
Easy, man. Just gettin' my works.

30:32.580 --> 30:34.665
No puzzle, cuz.

30:36.292 --> 30:39.086
I've got you all fixed up.

30:40.255 --> 30:42.798
Go ahead.

30:42.882 --> 30:44.925
Check it out.

30:46.302 --> 30:48.679
That's some righteous shit there, man.

30:48.763 --> 30:51.473
Satisfaction guaranteed.

31:18.918 --> 31:20.627
Do it, man.

31:24.591 --> 31:26.633
Yeah.

31:27.635 --> 31:30.095
Sweet heaven, here we come.

31:36.060 --> 31:38.145
Jack it off, man.

31:38.980 --> 31:42.357
Yeah. Jack it off.

31:56.915 --> 31:59.374
That's some nice shit, man.

32:00.418 --> 32:02.711
And you know that.

32:10.219 --> 32:12.512
Willie Red gets the best.

32:13.806 --> 32:15.557
Only the best.

32:17.143 --> 32:22.397
Kinda make you feel like
floatin' on a cloud of titties.

32:25.902 --> 32:28.028
So what about you, sister?

32:29.072 --> 32:31.573
You wanna taste?

32:31.658 --> 32:34.201
- No.
- No?

32:34.285 --> 32:36.703
No, she don't fix.

32:36.788 --> 32:39.414
The lady, she don't fix.

32:39.499 --> 32:41.166
Oh, man.

32:41.876 --> 32:46.171
She be missin' out on
the good things in life.

32:51.302 --> 32:53.053
I think she fix.

32:56.099 --> 32:58.308
I think she fix,

32:58.393 --> 33:00.936
else you don't walk outta here.

33:04.023 --> 33:06.733
Walker told us everything
was cool with you, man.

33:06.818 --> 33:09.194
He said "Just come on by,
everything's fine."

33:09.237 --> 33:14.908
Damn straight. Walker cool as
the other side of my pillow, honey.

33:15.076 --> 33:16.868
But you ain't showed me shit.

33:18.913 --> 33:21.248
What the fuck you come down here for?

33:21.749 --> 33:25.502
You don't wanna get down, tell me that.

33:30.299 --> 33:32.384
There you go, baby.

33:33.344 --> 33:36.722
Ain't nothin' to it but to do it.

33:40.268 --> 33:42.394
Yes, Lord.

33:43.271 --> 33:47.149
Pretty soon
you'll be feelin' all unnecessary.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.778
I know.

33:51.863 --> 33:54.114
Don't get nervous, baby.

33:54.240 --> 33:56.324
You amongst friends.

33:57.910 --> 34:00.287
Take your time, girl.

34:02.457 --> 34:05.500
Gonna be high as a Georgia pine.

34:12.632 --> 34:15.135
That's it, cuz. Help her out.

34:15.178 --> 34:17.471
Be a gentleman.

34:22.976 --> 34:25.312
Won't be long now.

34:42.330 --> 34:44.664
Look at 'em.

34:46.458 --> 34:48.710
Bitch got a rush.

34:52.047 --> 34:54.341
Dreamland, honey.

34:56.928 --> 35:01.765
Kinda taste it myself, you know,
just sittin' here watchin'.

35:02.225 --> 35:04.351
Just watchin'.

35:10.525 --> 35:13.026
Don't worry about it, baby.

35:13.111 --> 35:15.904
Happen to the best of us.

35:18.783 --> 35:20.867
You know, you're pretty stout.

35:22.078 --> 35:27.124
You're the first white boy
that takes some of this and don't puke.

35:27.708 --> 35:30.210
Well, I'll be wantin' more.

35:30.294 --> 35:32.379
I know you will.

35:40.346 --> 35:42.430
Oh, Lord.

36:01.075 --> 36:02.909
Hi.

36:07.456 --> 36:09.583
You sick?

36:20.928 --> 36:23.263
Did you smell him?

36:24.515 --> 36:26.683
Yeah, they don't take many baths.

36:28.477 --> 36:31.354
It's a better high if they're dirty.

36:31.439 --> 36:33.273
Really?

36:35.234 --> 36:37.944
Yeah. It doesn't leak through the skin.

36:43.701 --> 36:45.994
So what happens now?

36:47.747 --> 36:51.416
- We go back to sleep.
- No, I mean to him.

36:51.500 --> 36:53.793
He's already asleep.

36:59.800 --> 37:04.721
He's just like anybody else. We don't
touch any of them until we get them all.

37:11.562 --> 37:13.980
How bad did that scare you last night?

37:15.274 --> 37:16.942
Some.

37:17.985 --> 37:20.445
But I didn't mind.

37:20.488 --> 37:22.822
And I liked it.

37:25.159 --> 37:27.327
What did you like?

37:29.455 --> 37:31.873
I liked being there with you.

37:33.334 --> 37:35.794
And I liked being scared.

37:38.172 --> 37:40.715
I liked knowing he was going away for it.

37:45.846 --> 37:47.931
Don't like it too much.

37:48.808 --> 37:51.101
D'you like it too much, Jim?

37:54.855 --> 37:57.315
Yeah, I like it too much.

40:23.879 --> 40:26.172
- You cutting it?
- Yeah.

40:28.008 --> 40:30.510
- Mannitol.
- What the fuck, Jim?

40:32.513 --> 40:36.057
- What the fuck what, Kristen?
- What are you doing?

40:36.183 --> 40:39.978
I told you. I'm cutting it with Mannitol.

40:42.773 --> 40:45.692
It's all right. Be plenty left for evidence.

40:48.320 --> 40:50.238
What if I don't think it's all right?

40:52.616 --> 40:54.868
You're a cop.

40:54.952 --> 40:56.494
Arrest me.

41:13.637 --> 41:15.263
Who is it?

41:19.393 --> 41:21.561
- Come on, man.
- Hold on.

41:21.687 --> 41:23.730
Come on, Jim.

41:26.066 --> 41:30.361
- Just a damn minute.
- We ain't got a damn minute, Jimmy.

41:30.404 --> 41:32.280
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, Walker.

41:32.364 --> 41:35.408
This here is Scully. And this is Glenn.

41:35.534 --> 41:37.619
This is Jim.

41:38.537 --> 41:42.999
- You people nervous?
- Hey, Scully, I told you everything is cool.

41:43.083 --> 41:45.376
Hey. Come here, man.

41:45.419 --> 41:48.379
You wanted somethin', man? 500.

41:50.174 --> 41:51.758
I don't got that in the house, man.

41:53.802 --> 41:57.555
You wanna negotiate?
You wanna split down?

41:58.807 --> 42:00.767
What you got on your mind, man?

42:11.946 --> 42:12.987
Gimme half.

42:15.991 --> 42:18.660
See, the thing is we came over
as a favor to Walker here, you dig?

42:19.286 --> 42:23.289
We got other things to do at night besides
come by, find out you ain't got the cash.

42:24.375 --> 42:27.961
Well, you come back tomorrow then, man.

42:30.923 --> 42:34.968
I'm gonna keep this for the trip.
We'll be back.

42:35.094 --> 42:38.096
And next time, you'd better
fuckin' have the money.

42:38.764 --> 42:40.139
You dig?

42:56.240 --> 42:58.616
You know somethin'?

42:58.701 --> 43:00.243
You stink up this room.

43:00.995 --> 43:06.332
Fuckers look at my woman like they can't
decide where to stick their dicks in first,

43:06.417 --> 43:08.835
then tell me they're gonna come back!

43:12.131 --> 43:15.008
Right there, you motherfucker.

43:16.844 --> 43:18.803
You dig, man?

43:19.263 --> 43:20.305
You got a piece?

43:21.265 --> 43:22.849
Take it out.

43:23.976 --> 43:26.227
- It's just business.
- Take it out!

43:30.649 --> 43:32.692
It's finished.

43:44.955 --> 43:47.999
What the fuck
are you trying to do to us, boy?

43:48.042 --> 43:51.294
What's goin' on?
I mean, you said you wanted speed.

43:58.969 --> 44:00.428
It's what he said.

44:07.936 --> 44:10.563
I'm scared.

44:10.606 --> 44:13.066
Of them?

44:13.150 --> 44:15.276
That's the Hell's Pussies.

44:15.361 --> 44:17.403
Not them. Us.

44:18.447 --> 44:23.034
Somethin's changin' here and we've got
less control of it all the time.

44:26.205 --> 44:28.539
That's the whole game, baby.

44:28.582 --> 44:30.667
Nobody's got control.

44:32.086 --> 44:34.754
It's just bein' out here you can see that.

44:38.133 --> 44:42.053
I've been thinking since Willie Red's,
what if you got shot?

44:42.971 --> 44:45.932
What do I do then?

44:45.974 --> 44:48.059
- You mean dead?
- Yeah.

44:50.604 --> 44:54.524
I would take it as a personal favor
if you'd shoot 'em back.

44:55.567 --> 44:57.610
That's not what I meant.

45:01.615 --> 45:06.119
All I know is that
if somebody shoots your partner,

45:06.161 --> 45:09.747
you don't leave it
for the lawyers to sort out.

45:09.790 --> 45:13.584
"Diminished capacity"
and "mitigating circumstances".

45:18.799 --> 45:20.842
That happened, didn't it?

45:24.346 --> 45:26.472
It happened.

45:52.040 --> 45:54.167
- Hey.
- Hey.

45:55.836 --> 45:59.630
- You're losin' weight.
- We're working day and night.

46:01.300 --> 46:04.093
You're closin' in on a dozen cases.

46:04.178 --> 46:05.803
Not bad.

46:08.182 --> 46:11.225
Jesus. Jimmy's buyin' a shitload of crystal.

46:11.310 --> 46:14.103
That and coke. There's a lot around.

46:14.188 --> 46:16.898
The motorcycle element's takin' it over.

46:19.193 --> 46:21.277
A lot of familiar names here.

46:23.197 --> 46:26.282
- Any news on Gaines?
- We're workin' on it.

46:26.366 --> 46:30.453
We're lettin' him see us,
lettin' him know we're interested.

46:30.621 --> 46:31.913
You're wired.

46:35.209 --> 46:38.878
Not bad. I came here from a coke buy.

46:39.505 --> 46:41.839
You're not taking your work home at night?

46:43.300 --> 46:45.885
I'm so sick of the Driller's Club I could puke.

46:45.928 --> 46:50.723
Then at home it's the same people lyin' on
the couch or bangin' on the door to get in.

46:51.391 --> 46:52.892
That's not what I mean.

46:56.021 --> 46:59.649
I know. But it's a fine line, Dodd.

47:03.904 --> 47:07.156
I used to do a lot of that shit onetime,

47:07.241 --> 47:09.325
till it got me shot in the toe.

47:11.245 --> 47:14.580
You don't know what hurt's about
till you've been shot in the toe.

47:14.623 --> 47:16.082
Well...

47:21.630 --> 47:24.590
You and Jim still sharin' bed and board?

47:26.260 --> 47:28.678
Off and on.

47:28.762 --> 47:30.930
You still got
the other address, though, right?

47:31.765 --> 47:36.644
Nettle'll have my ass if it turns out you
and Raynor don't have separate places.

47:36.770 --> 47:38.896
We got the other place.

47:38.939 --> 47:40.815
Good.

47:44.945 --> 47:46.988
There's 4,500.

47:49.616 --> 47:52.118
- Get some rest.
- Right.

48:17.019 --> 48:19.186
All right! Jeez.

48:26.403 --> 48:29.947
Did I bring her home last night?
Jesus! Come on in.

48:39.082 --> 48:43.419
- Need a wake-me-up?
- I was thinkin' more the other direction.

48:43.503 --> 48:46.339
- Well, I might.
- Ludes or a Valium?

48:53.597 --> 48:56.140
- Well, I've got some Kool-Aid.
- Great.

49:06.151 --> 49:08.235
So, I'm glad you came by.

49:09.279 --> 49:13.532
'Cause I've been wanting us to, like,
you know, hold a conversation,

49:13.659 --> 49:15.701
for quite some time.

49:19.414 --> 49:24.085
So, my friends and me,
well, we're kinda concerned.

49:24.169 --> 49:26.879
Well, they're kinda concerned about Jim.

49:31.051 --> 49:33.052
Damn. This darn thing.

49:33.095 --> 49:36.555
Every day this thing
comes up 40 minutes slow.

49:36.598 --> 49:39.600
Like, every time,
you know, I'm looking at it,

49:39.685 --> 49:45.439
it's like this little voice in the back of my
head saying "Rolex, my ass", you know?

49:45.691 --> 49:47.191
Take it back.

49:48.694 --> 49:51.195
Guy gave it to me for some blow.

49:55.951 --> 50:00.538
There are some people
that think Jim might be a cop.

50:06.169 --> 50:10.506
I'm not sayin' he is.
It's just that some people are wonderin'.

50:10.590 --> 50:15.386
I mean, he shows up last October.
I mean, the dude, he don't work.

50:16.430 --> 50:18.764
He buys dope from everybody in town.

50:40.746 --> 50:43.873
Look, I'm not saying he is.
You understand that?

50:45.042 --> 50:48.294
It's just that folks were wondering...
A man could get hurt.

50:49.880 --> 50:54.133
Well, that's the thing, Walker.
A man could get hurt.

50:55.635 --> 50:58.012
Look, I don't think he is.

50:59.222 --> 51:01.724
But I'm in deep shit if I'm wrong.

51:08.065 --> 51:13.110
I just figured you were the one to talk to
'cause, you know, I know you're cool.

51:14.988 --> 51:17.073
I mean, I like you.

51:17.908 --> 51:21.243
And I know, you know,
you'd know if Jim was a cop.

51:24.998 --> 51:27.500
You wanna talk to Jim about this?

51:27.626 --> 51:30.252
Just get this whole thing cleared up?

51:30.337 --> 51:32.421
Yeah, let's talk to Jim.

51:52.818 --> 51:55.277
Jimmy.

51:55.362 --> 51:58.906
Y'all tryin' to hatch somethin'?
Must be 90 degrees in here.

52:03.411 --> 52:05.496
What time is it?

52:06.832 --> 52:09.792
Well, maybe somewhere around 5:00.

52:19.511 --> 52:21.804
Excuse me a minute.

52:24.182 --> 52:25.891
You want coffee?

52:35.944 --> 52:39.572
He probably went in there
and fell back asleep.

52:39.656 --> 52:41.740
- I'll be right back.
- Go ahead.

52:54.629 --> 52:56.922
We got a problem.

53:06.766 --> 53:08.684
Hey.

53:08.768 --> 53:11.645
What's on your mind?

53:11.730 --> 53:14.023
He thinks you're a cop.

53:18.737 --> 53:23.240
That right, Walker?
You been tellin' people I'm the heat?

53:25.869 --> 53:27.953
I wouldn't do that, man.

53:28.038 --> 53:30.289
I just think you should know...

53:32.417 --> 53:34.001
People are concerned.

53:35.128 --> 53:39.423
- What made you think I was the heat?
- I don't know exactly.

53:41.968 --> 53:46.513
I guess ain't nobody can do as much dope
as y'all have been buying.

53:46.598 --> 53:49.683
And I ain't heard anyone buyin' from you.

53:51.061 --> 53:52.978
Hey.

53:54.314 --> 53:57.316
Let me get somethin' real clear here.

54:00.153 --> 54:05.407
You ever tell one solitary motherfucker
one word of what I say, and I'll kill you.

54:06.534 --> 54:08.118
That simple.

54:09.246 --> 54:14.208
I'll drop this fuckin' hammer on your ass
so fast you'll be dead before you got here.

54:15.168 --> 54:17.670
- You understand?
- Yeah.

54:28.723 --> 54:30.015
Well, you got it right.

54:32.477 --> 54:36.689
Oh, hell, boy. You didn't think we were the
heat, what the fuck you come up here for?

54:43.488 --> 54:45.656
All this time I was tryin' to hit on you.

54:45.699 --> 54:49.827
I just figured maybe I could do it
without old Jim findin' out.

54:49.869 --> 54:53.914
Yeah, well, that's nice,
but we need some answers now, boy.

54:53.999 --> 54:57.376
- You wanna slide or not?
- What do I have to do?

54:57.460 --> 55:01.547
You do what you've been doin'. You
make the introductions and you will walk.

55:04.384 --> 55:07.720
- What does that make me?
- Makes you free.

55:10.724 --> 55:15.311
Yeah, well, don't I get a lawyer? I wanna
talk to somebody who's in authority.

55:15.395 --> 55:17.771
And I wanna know what's goin' on, man.

55:28.074 --> 55:29.158
Dodd?

55:29.743 --> 55:32.077
Yeah.

55:32.162 --> 55:36.540
Look, we've got someone here
who wants to work for us. Yeah.

55:36.583 --> 55:38.834
No, no, I checked it out.

55:39.586 --> 55:42.463
No, that, that won't be a problem.

55:42.881 --> 55:44.882
Okay.

55:44.966 --> 55:47.509
- Let's go.
- Where?

55:47.594 --> 55:49.386
We're gonna go see the chief.

55:50.263 --> 55:52.181
Look, I think I oughta have a lawyer, man.

55:57.562 --> 55:59.229
There's a phone.

55:59.314 --> 56:03.275
You call your lawyer and I'll call the chief,
tell him I made a mistake.

56:03.318 --> 56:07.529
You wanna do 40 years?
You wanna do 40 fuckin' years, Walker?

56:08.948 --> 56:11.033
Which way is it gonna be?

57:03.002 --> 57:05.087
This is Mr. Walker.

57:07.173 --> 57:09.842
How much of Mr. Walker's ass do we own?

57:10.176 --> 57:12.219
Eight or ten cases.

57:14.013 --> 57:18.100
We bought from him at least eight times.

57:24.274 --> 57:25.983
You know a fella named Gaines?

57:26.985 --> 57:28.610
Well, yes, sir. I do.

57:28.695 --> 57:31.447
You get us Gaines, son,
you got no problem.

57:31.531 --> 57:34.616
That and cooperate
with the officers on the others.

57:35.535 --> 57:40.747
I could try, sir, but Will Gaines don't deal
with nobody he don't know from Houston.

57:41.958 --> 57:43.375
You try hard, son.

57:44.669 --> 57:48.547
Wipe that fuckin' smile off your face
and figure this out.

57:48.590 --> 57:51.550
If you don't, you're goin' away.

57:58.725 --> 57:59.850
Man!

58:02.729 --> 58:04.855
Cool it. You'll be okay.

58:05.732 --> 58:09.067
They want Gaines,
and y'all want my friends.

58:09.152 --> 58:12.196
I'm not gonna be okay.
That's my friends, man.

58:12.238 --> 58:16.617
Hey, you won't even see the inside
of a courtroom if you do what's right.

58:16.701 --> 58:19.870
Maybe we can work somethin' out
for some of your friends, too.

58:19.913 --> 58:24.249
But first you got this in front of you.
You hear what we're sayin'?

58:24.334 --> 58:27.920
You gonna do it, let's go. Right now.

58:28.004 --> 58:30.422
You show me where your loyalties are.

58:32.800 --> 58:35.135
- What?
- Your buddy that drives that hearse.

58:35.220 --> 58:36.303
Is he holdin'?

58:39.474 --> 58:41.433
- Man!
- Answer me.

58:47.607 --> 58:48.941
Yeah, man.

59:21.683 --> 59:23.642
- Hey, Bobby.
- What's up, Slick?

59:23.768 --> 59:25.811
How you doin'?

59:26.437 --> 59:28.480
- Hi.
- Hi.

59:30.108 --> 59:31.650
So what d'you have in mind, man?

59:32.277 --> 59:35.529
Walker here said you might
be able to score us some coke.

59:42.412 --> 59:47.082
Well, if Walker says you're all right,
that's good enough for me.

59:47.166 --> 59:50.335
- How much you want?
- Well, how much you got?

59:53.506 --> 59:56.341
I'm a little bit country

59:56.426 --> 59:59.344
And she's a little bit rock'n'roll

59:59.470 --> 01:00:01.513
Hey, baby.

01:00:02.849 --> 01:00:07.561
- Some party.
- Yeah. Look who gets to do the dishes.

01:00:14.485 --> 01:00:16.612
Blue ringers.

01:00:16.696 --> 01:00:19.740
- I never heard of it.
- Well, me either.

01:00:19.824 --> 01:00:22.159
But the dude's got thousands of 'em.

01:00:24.495 --> 01:00:27.623
This is the best I've felt
since all this happened.

01:00:42.221 --> 01:00:44.890
Dude's name is Monroe.

01:00:45.016 --> 01:00:48.810
I told him you wanted a coupla
hundred of 'em, if they're any good.

01:00:59.697 --> 01:01:01.740
You mind if I just lay here a while?

01:01:03.368 --> 01:01:07.162
Don't feel too comfortable
at my own place any more, you know?

01:01:12.168 --> 01:01:13.919
I'm tellin' you.

01:01:31.396 --> 01:01:33.438
Shit.

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:52.833
Watch your step.

01:01:55.211 --> 01:01:57.504
You live for music, right?

01:02:03.761 --> 01:02:05.804
You want a beer.

01:02:06.639 --> 01:02:08.140
Guess I do.

01:02:09.308 --> 01:02:10.976
Sit down.

01:02:29.871 --> 01:02:31.788
Body temperature.

01:02:31.914 --> 01:02:35.125
I keep everything here human temperature.

01:02:42.717 --> 01:02:44.468
So...

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:47.846
How many you want?

01:02:49.098 --> 01:02:50.849
Where's the break?

01:02:50.892 --> 01:02:55.145
$3 apiece up to a hundred.
More than that's $2.50.

01:02:55.855 --> 01:02:57.689
A hundred sounds good.

01:02:58.649 --> 01:03:00.317
Walker said you'd want more.

01:03:04.030 --> 01:03:05.697
No.

01:03:05.782 --> 01:03:07.365
A hundred's fine.

01:03:24.258 --> 01:03:27.886
- You wanna count 'em?
- No, I trust you.

01:03:28.179 --> 01:03:29.721
Yeah?

01:03:36.687 --> 01:03:38.855
Let's get fucked up, honey.

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:42.400
I got people waitin' on these.
I gotta drive back.

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:44.402
Let's get fucked up.

01:03:53.579 --> 01:03:55.163
I gotta git.

01:04:06.175 --> 01:04:08.677
- Peace.
- Peace.

01:04:08.761 --> 01:04:10.220
Right.

01:04:13.099 --> 01:04:14.891
Happy motorin'.

01:05:36.891 --> 01:05:40.477
If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.

01:05:40.519 --> 01:05:43.855
If you need help, hang up
and then dial the operator.

01:05:46.067 --> 01:05:47.734
Hello.

01:05:56.035 --> 01:06:01.039
We're sorry. Your call did not go through.
Will you please try your call again?

01:06:32.238 --> 01:06:34.322
Officer Cates.

01:06:38.077 --> 01:06:39.828
You all right?

01:06:40.913 --> 01:06:42.914
I don't know.

01:06:43.082 --> 01:06:45.792
Wanna go back to my place
and talk about it?

01:06:46.752 --> 01:06:48.878
I got a cold beer.

01:06:49.714 --> 01:06:51.589
No.

01:06:55.594 --> 01:06:57.429
What's wrong?

01:06:57.513 --> 01:06:59.973
Nothin'.

01:07:00.099 --> 01:07:03.810
I just don't feel like
bein' in anybody's house right now.

01:07:12.653 --> 01:07:15.155
Can I get you somethin', Jimmy?

01:08:27.435 --> 01:08:29.938
There's gotta be more here somewhere.

01:08:54.587 --> 01:08:57.048
- You want some Preludin?
- Yeah.

01:08:58.091 --> 01:09:00.218
Anything.

01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:20.113
- There's nothing in the house.
- Where's this all going, Jim?

01:09:25.118 --> 01:09:28.412
We just have to wait and see.

01:09:31.959 --> 01:09:34.085
Don't do that.

01:09:35.629 --> 01:09:38.965
Don't... Don't... Don't... Don't do that.

01:09:48.809 --> 01:09:50.935
Kristen.

01:09:52.813 --> 01:09:54.939
Kristen.

01:10:50.454 --> 01:10:52.413
Listen to me.

01:10:52.498 --> 01:10:54.332
What?

01:11:00.005 --> 01:11:02.090
I'm sorry.

01:11:06.428 --> 01:11:08.513
I'm sorry.

01:13:18.685 --> 01:13:20.561
Jim.

01:13:21.063 --> 01:13:22.939
Jim.

01:14:34.386 --> 01:14:36.053
Jim.

01:14:39.391 --> 01:14:40.850
Hello?

01:14:41.226 --> 01:14:42.852
Yeah.

01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:50.610
Hi.

01:14:50.736 --> 01:14:52.778
A cab?

01:14:52.905 --> 01:14:56.032
On it like a hawk on a June bug.

01:14:57.367 --> 01:15:01.162
Everybody's always sayin'
"Why don't you just take a cab?"

01:15:09.713 --> 01:15:11.797
So who kicked in your door?

01:15:13.008 --> 01:15:15.510
It was like that when I got in last night.

01:15:16.595 --> 01:15:19.305
Jim was here. He probably knows.

01:15:19.431 --> 01:15:21.474
Where's he at lately?

01:15:23.435 --> 01:15:25.603
Out on a deal maybe.

01:15:26.605 --> 01:15:29.106
He's worried about Gaines.

01:15:29.149 --> 01:15:31.901
Well, Gaines is somethin' to worry about.

01:15:40.452 --> 01:15:43.496
Well, listen. Are we workin' tonight?

01:15:44.373 --> 01:15:46.249
Yeah.

01:15:46.333 --> 01:15:50.795
I got some stuff comin' through from
that taxidermist you introduced me to.

01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:57.301
I ought to have him bring it by here,
though. I'm not much up to goin' out.

01:15:57.344 --> 01:15:59.637
All right.

01:15:59.721 --> 01:16:03.057
Well, maybe I'll just hang out here a while.

01:16:05.769 --> 01:16:07.645
If you want.

01:16:20.033 --> 01:16:22.118
Jim?

01:17:21.345 --> 01:17:23.137
Where are you?

01:17:51.583 --> 01:17:52.583
Lock it.

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:57.380
Just lock the door!

01:18:02.928 --> 01:18:04.428
People comin'.

01:18:05.764 --> 01:18:07.723
There is nobody comin', Jim.

01:18:10.102 --> 01:18:11.519
Yeah, there is.

01:18:27.285 --> 01:18:31.372
Preludin, Desoxyn, crank.

01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:34.542
Preludin, Preludin, Biphetamine.

01:18:35.168 --> 01:18:36.877
There's no evidence here.

01:18:38.004 --> 01:18:41.924
What are you doin'?
What the hell do you think you're doin'?

01:18:43.427 --> 01:18:44.927
My job.

01:18:47.305 --> 01:18:49.432
I'm doin' my fuckin' job.

01:18:50.642 --> 01:18:53.769
Hey, Jim, talk to me about handlin' it.

01:18:53.812 --> 01:18:57.314
I need to hear about
kickin' the covers for a week or two.

01:18:57.399 --> 01:19:00.693
Gettin' up on your feet and walkin'!
Tell me that!

01:19:01.069 --> 01:19:07.158
All I can do is wait
and get everybody out of the way. Away.

01:19:10.954 --> 01:19:12.037
They're comin'.

01:19:12.914 --> 01:19:14.749
I don't wanna be out of the way, Jim.

01:19:16.543 --> 01:19:18.043
Okay?

01:21:17.914 --> 01:21:19.957
What's wrong?

01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:22.501
My chair is gone.

01:21:22.586 --> 01:21:23.627
What?

01:21:25.213 --> 01:21:27.298
My chair's gone.

01:21:28.174 --> 01:21:32.970
I sucked it up my ass when Nettle asked
what the hell was goin' on with you two.

01:21:33.513 --> 01:21:35.806
- He's hot.
- About what?

01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:38.767
About what? He wants to know
where is his case on Gaines.

01:21:38.810 --> 01:21:40.102
We're workin' on it.

01:21:40.145 --> 01:21:44.273
What? That nickel-and-dime shit
you're givin' us on Walker's friends?

01:21:44.357 --> 01:21:46.483
You're givin' us nothin' lately.

01:21:50.196 --> 01:21:52.781
Where's your partner there disappeared to?

01:21:56.077 --> 01:21:58.662
He up there?

01:21:58.747 --> 01:22:00.205
No.

01:22:12.802 --> 01:22:14.178
He's on a run, isn't he?

01:22:16.306 --> 01:22:18.599
He's on a run and you're hidin' him.

01:22:25.982 --> 01:22:28.400
Think he's up there turnin' over a new leaf?

01:22:34.032 --> 01:22:35.532
How long's it been?

01:22:39.913 --> 01:22:42.831
- A week or two, maybe longer.
- Jesus.

01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:51.215
Well, let's go see him.

01:23:01.893 --> 01:23:02.893
Jimmy?

01:23:06.731 --> 01:23:08.440
Jim?

01:23:16.825 --> 01:23:17.908
What have you done?

01:23:19.911 --> 01:23:21.996
It's all right. He's been there.

01:23:23.123 --> 01:23:25.207
But he ain't there now, is he?

01:23:26.376 --> 01:23:29.086
Not now he's nine-to-five.

01:23:29.170 --> 01:23:31.630
Back home with a wife and a family.

01:23:35.885 --> 01:23:38.220
How many cases are bad?

01:23:38.304 --> 01:23:40.014
D'you see?

01:23:40.098 --> 01:23:43.726
- I gotta know, man. Give me a number.
- Well, I don't have a fuckin' number.

01:23:44.477 --> 01:23:48.981
Look, Jimmy. I've been there, man,
right where you are now.

01:23:50.608 --> 01:23:53.235
We got a problem.
I need to know how bad it is.

01:23:59.242 --> 01:24:01.952
You tell me how bad it is, Dodd.

01:24:04.039 --> 01:24:06.206
Tell me how bad it is.

01:24:07.417 --> 01:24:11.170
This is a great deal.
You've landed us both in prison.

01:24:11.296 --> 01:24:16.383
- Nobody's goin' away over this.
- Not you, Dodd. Get back to the suburbs.

01:24:16.468 --> 01:24:18.635
I gotta know. Nettle's gotta know!

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:20.804
Fuck Nettle!

01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:25.517
You got somethin' to make him sleep?

01:24:26.770 --> 01:24:29.480
Yeah... Yeah.

01:24:30.398 --> 01:24:32.775
Fix yourself, Dodd.

01:24:35.487 --> 01:24:38.405
You wanna fix up, old buddy?

01:26:04.576 --> 01:26:08.745
Gloria has been reading a book
about women's lib.

01:26:08.997 --> 01:26:10.998
Oh, jeez.

01:26:11.124 --> 01:26:13.917
Three books, Daddy.
I didn't read 'em, I devoured 'em.

01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:16.503
Not only that, I had Michael read 'em, too.

01:26:16.588 --> 01:26:19.840
- Mike?
- He recognizes, and you'd better too,

01:26:19.924 --> 01:26:22.009
that women are individuals.

01:26:22.093 --> 01:26:26.471
It ain't enough that he's an atheist?
You're turning him into a morphodite.

01:26:29.267 --> 01:26:30.767
What's a morphodite?

01:26:30.852 --> 01:26:34.605
A freak with a little too much of each
and not enough of neither.

01:26:49.454 --> 01:26:51.288
You pulled up.

01:26:51.372 --> 01:26:53.207
The needles, anyway.

01:26:59.881 --> 01:27:01.965
Okay. Under.

01:27:09.807 --> 01:27:13.143
Now, will you need anything else?

01:27:15.230 --> 01:27:17.981
Well, I'll just let you have your meeting.

01:27:18.024 --> 01:27:20.317
It was nice to meet you, Miss Cates.

01:27:31.287 --> 01:27:33.580
So, we have a situation.

01:27:34.958 --> 01:27:36.333
How bad is it?

01:27:38.336 --> 01:27:41.088
Well, let's say I've had a rough time.

01:27:42.131 --> 01:27:44.216
Exactly what are we talking about?

01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:14.579
Let's pray together.

01:28:19.210 --> 01:28:24.881
Lord, please offer this man your help and
your strength as he faces a difficult task,

01:28:25.758 --> 01:28:30.887
for we are soldiers in your army, and
we fight your enemies with our very lives.

01:28:31.347 --> 01:28:33.223
Amen.

01:28:35.977 --> 01:28:38.312
Looks like you could use a few days off.

01:28:39.105 --> 01:28:42.566
Why don't the two of you
go to Corpus Christi, get some rest,

01:28:42.608 --> 01:28:44.443
then come back
and make the case on Gaines?

01:28:56.372 --> 01:28:57.873
Appreciate the confidence.

01:29:02.837 --> 01:29:03.837
Wait a minute.

01:29:04.922 --> 01:29:08.091
What'd you say if we told you
Gaines isn't dealin' drugs?

01:29:08.134 --> 01:29:10.510
I'd say "When are you
gonna make the case?"

01:29:10.595 --> 01:29:15.223
Will Gaines isn't dealin' drugs.
At least not to us.

01:29:15.266 --> 01:29:18.018
We've tried to get next to the man
for five months.

01:29:18.102 --> 01:29:21.271
He won't come across with anything.
Nothin'. He won't even talk about it.

01:29:22.398 --> 01:29:26.443
Now, Will Gaines is a dealer in drugs
and pornography, and that is a fact.

01:29:27.278 --> 01:29:28.612
Make the case.

01:29:30.948 --> 01:29:32.908
Are you tellin' us to plant evidence?

01:29:36.245 --> 01:29:40.707
I'm tellin' you that sometimes good work
is accomplished in mysterious ways.

01:29:42.710 --> 01:29:44.419
We can't do that.

01:29:49.300 --> 01:29:51.635
Make the case.

01:29:51.719 --> 01:29:54.179
An arm like that

01:29:54.263 --> 01:29:57.724
could be hard to explain to a jury,
don't you think?

01:30:33.094 --> 01:30:35.512
Here we go.

01:30:57.243 --> 01:30:59.703
Look, I need something you've got.

01:31:04.167 --> 01:31:06.418
Somebody told me you were a badass.

01:31:07.336 --> 01:31:09.588
There's no bad-asses.

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:14.885
Ain't nobody can't die.

01:31:20.391 --> 01:31:22.976
Tell me somethin', badass.

01:31:23.060 --> 01:31:25.353
D'you think I'm stupid?

01:31:46.918 --> 01:31:48.960
So it's "Us or them" time.

01:31:52.089 --> 01:31:54.591
It's got that feel, you know?

01:31:56.844 --> 01:31:59.429
Somebody's about to get the short stick.

01:32:02.725 --> 01:32:04.809
I just want it to end.

01:32:06.646 --> 01:32:09.314
It isn't gonna soon.

01:32:09.398 --> 01:32:11.900
- He'll make bail.
- And then what?

01:32:14.028 --> 01:32:16.321
And then we'll see.

01:32:21.827 --> 01:32:24.120
You know what scares me?

01:32:25.915 --> 01:32:30.460
The thought of all those people
gettin' up in court, tellin' what we did.

01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:34.673
Nobody believes them,

01:32:34.757 --> 01:32:37.551
except other dealers and other cops.

01:32:38.594 --> 01:32:41.680
That's what makes the whole thing work.

01:32:41.806 --> 01:32:44.099
You never admit to anything.

01:32:45.476 --> 01:32:48.728
Someone's holdin' the evidence
in your face.

01:32:48.854 --> 01:32:50.939
Nothing.

01:32:58.656 --> 01:33:00.865
What about your arm?

01:33:03.327 --> 01:33:05.495
I haven't decided yet.

01:33:45.411 --> 01:33:47.537
What's goin' on?

01:33:49.582 --> 01:33:51.207
We're doin' it this afternoon.

01:33:53.169 --> 01:33:55.962
We can prearrange your bail,
arrest you with everybody,

01:33:56.047 --> 01:33:58.214
make it look like you weren't involved.

01:33:59.425 --> 01:34:01.760
No, I can't do that.

01:34:02.845 --> 01:34:04.596
That'd make it worse than it already is.

01:34:05.306 --> 01:34:09.309
Well, you better get outta town,
stay with relatives somewhere.

01:34:09.393 --> 01:34:14.230
Well, hey, I can't do that either.
My relatives, they all live here in Katterly.

01:34:17.234 --> 01:34:19.778
Well, there ain't no place to hide.

01:34:20.237 --> 01:34:22.947
People know where you live, Walker.

01:34:23.074 --> 01:34:25.742
Well, I expect they do. I mean...

01:34:29.455 --> 01:34:32.582
We could set you up in Houston.
I'll talk to Dodd.

01:34:34.543 --> 01:34:38.088
I got friends gonna be doin' 40 years.
Isn't that what Jim said?

01:34:38.172 --> 01:34:42.967
40 years for sellin' somebody a dime bag
that I asked 'em to sell.

01:34:44.303 --> 01:34:48.181
You don't want me to just
run off now and hide. No.

01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:51.768
You gonna make me arrest you, Walker?

01:34:59.777 --> 01:35:04.280
Lookit, Kristen, everything I've done
for the past three months

01:35:04.365 --> 01:35:07.617
has been because
I was scared of somethin' else.

01:35:07.702 --> 01:35:11.454
And now there ain't nothin' I'm scared of
'cause it's right here.

01:35:12.456 --> 01:35:15.917
I'm fuckin' ashamed.
D'you understand that?

01:35:18.462 --> 01:35:22.549
Yeah. I understand that.

01:35:22.842 --> 01:35:26.219
Well, you don't got nothin'
to scare me with no more.

01:36:42.213 --> 01:36:46.591
Officer, put him in the cell,
then go ahead and start the paperwork.

01:36:57.728 --> 01:37:01.356
Hey, man, you're a fuckin' dead man.

01:37:01.482 --> 01:37:03.608
A fuckin' dead man.

01:37:07.154 --> 01:37:11.241
You're out on bail in 12 hours, right?
You come find me.

01:37:11.408 --> 01:37:14.911
You come find me,
then we'll see who's dead, okay?

01:38:10.217 --> 01:38:12.468
Okay, they're up on the second floor.

01:38:53.427 --> 01:38:55.511
Cut him, cut him down.

01:39:38.639 --> 01:39:44.018
I'd like to direct your attention to
case number 97 involving Mr. Will Gaines.

01:39:44.728 --> 01:39:45.895
Yes, sir.

01:39:46.021 --> 01:39:49.107
Now, Sergeant Raynor's
already testified in this case,

01:39:49.191 --> 01:39:51.985
so we just want to go over it with you.

01:39:53.070 --> 01:39:56.114
31 st of May. Do you recall that date?

01:39:56.198 --> 01:39:57.532
Yes, sir.

01:39:57.574 --> 01:40:00.576
In the afternoon of that date
did you and Sergeant Raynor

01:40:00.619 --> 01:40:04.247
have occasion to speak to each other
concerning Mr. Gaines?

01:40:04.331 --> 01:40:05.999
Yes, sir, we did.

01:40:06.083 --> 01:40:08.710
What was the nature of that conversation?

01:40:08.752 --> 01:40:13.047
We discussed the possibility of making a
cocaine purchase from him that evening.

01:40:13.090 --> 01:40:16.926
- Where did you make the purchase?
- The Driller's Club.

01:40:17.011 --> 01:40:21.347
- And what time did you arrive?
- Shortly after 11:00.

01:40:21.432 --> 01:40:23.808
Did you meet with Mr. Gaines?

01:40:23.892 --> 01:40:27.395
Sergeant Raynor did. I sat in the car
while he bought the cocaine.

01:40:27.438 --> 01:40:30.273
- From Gaines?
- Yes, sir. From Will Gaines.

01:40:32.109 --> 01:40:35.111
What exactly did you see?

01:40:35.237 --> 01:40:38.531
I saw Will Gaines step out the back door
of the Driller's Club,

01:40:38.615 --> 01:40:41.701
where he engaged Sergeant Raynor
in a short conversation.

01:40:41.785 --> 01:40:45.621
He turned over to Sergeant Raynor
an envelope filled with white powder

01:40:45.664 --> 01:40:47.957
which proved to be cocaine.

01:40:48.042 --> 01:40:53.671
- Are you sure that it was Will Gaines?
- Yes, sir. There is not a doubt in my mind.

01:40:53.756 --> 01:40:56.299
Thank you, Miss Cates.

01:40:56.341 --> 01:41:00.678
The grand jury appreciates
your time and your testimony.

01:41:00.763 --> 01:41:05.808
We appreciate the courage you've shown
these last months in buildin' this case.

01:41:06.810 --> 01:41:09.645
You and Sergeant Raynor
are to be commended.

01:41:09.688 --> 01:41:11.522
Yes, sir. Thank you.

01:41:21.158 --> 01:41:22.992
Raynor?

01:41:25.996 --> 01:41:29.582
- Did he make bail?
- $250,000.

01:41:29.666 --> 01:41:33.002
He got Sam Austin out of Fort Worth
to represent him.

01:41:34.088 --> 01:41:37.590
I rented us a trailer this morning
over at Spider Lake.

01:41:40.302 --> 01:41:43.846
So many of 'em turnin' on each other,
they won't have time to look for us.

01:41:43.931 --> 01:41:46.641
I don't know.
We're on TV enough to remind them.

01:41:58.278 --> 01:42:02.156
There's nothing at the garage
that would interest a girl. Go to bed.

01:42:02.199 --> 01:42:06.452
No, Daddy. Please tell me a story.
I won't be able to fall asleep. Please!

01:42:06.537 --> 01:42:08.329
Okay!

01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:16.379
Feels like a long ride to nowhere,
doesn't it?

01:42:19.550 --> 01:42:24.554
You know, after I finished with
the grand jury, they applauded me.

01:42:27.266 --> 01:42:29.392
It made me feel sick.

01:42:33.438 --> 01:42:35.565
I feel sick.

01:42:45.784 --> 01:42:48.494
You pick a side,

01:42:48.579 --> 01:42:50.663
because you have to.

01:42:53.083 --> 01:42:55.543
It isn't supposed to be the right one.

01:42:59.673 --> 01:43:02.508
The difference being

01:43:03.552 --> 01:43:05.928
our intentions were good.

01:43:06.972 --> 01:43:08.514
But...

01:43:08.599 --> 01:43:11.642
The difference is there isn't any difference.

01:44:00.025 --> 01:44:01.484
Jim?

01:44:06.073 --> 01:44:07.949
Do you think about Walker?

01:44:10.327 --> 01:44:11.994
Yeah.

01:44:17.834 --> 01:44:19.919
When I think about him now,

01:44:22.172 --> 01:44:24.715
it's like he's a saint.

01:45:15.642 --> 01:45:16.892
No! Jim!

01:45:35.412 --> 01:45:38.164
- Press here.
- Shit!

01:45:38.248 --> 01:45:40.666
Press hard here, okay? Press!

01:45:40.751 --> 01:45:42.126
Okay.

01:45:57.476 --> 01:45:58.476
I got you.

01:46:02.105 --> 01:46:05.608
Okay. Jim, I'm gonna get you some help.

01:46:05.942 --> 01:46:07.109
Press.

01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:35.721
Get away! I already called the police!

01:46:35.806 --> 01:46:38.349
- Please!
- I'm warnin' you! I got a gun!

01:46:38.433 --> 01:46:40.476
Go on now! Get away!

01:46:56.827 --> 01:46:58.202
Jim.

01:46:59.246 --> 01:47:02.248
Just a little while longer. Help's coming.

01:47:02.332 --> 01:47:04.500
I think I'm gonna puke.

01:47:04.584 --> 01:47:05.876
Okay.

01:47:05.961 --> 01:47:08.879
I'm here. I'm here.

01:47:09.005 --> 01:47:11.924
Squeeze my hand.
Can you squeeze my hand?

01:47:12.008 --> 01:47:14.051
That's good. Good.

01:47:16.513 --> 01:47:19.640
Jim... Jim...

01:47:19.683 --> 01:47:21.517
It's okay.

01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:23.227
You're doin' great.

01:47:23.812 --> 01:47:26.313
They're gonna be here any minute, Jim.

01:47:27.816 --> 01:47:30.151
Jim, look at me.

01:47:31.111 --> 01:47:33.195
Good. Good.

01:47:40.203 --> 01:47:42.288
I love you.

01:47:43.039 --> 01:47:44.832
I love you.

01:47:58.305 --> 01:48:00.389
They're gonna be here soon, Jim.

01:48:02.100 --> 01:48:04.226
Jim?

01:48:05.395 --> 01:48:07.480
Jim!

01:48:11.276 --> 01:48:13.194
Jim!

01:48:13.862 --> 01:48:15.863
Jim!

01:48:15.906 --> 01:48:17.448
Oh, God!

01:48:18.450 --> 01:48:20.159
Oh, God!

01:48:20.911 --> 01:48:23.037
No! Please!

01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:25.706
Jim!

01:48:27.459 --> 01:48:29.376
Jim...

01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:34.215
Oh, please, please, God!

01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:40.638
Jim.

01:49:22.597 --> 01:49:26.475
Now, what happened
after the gun woke you on the couch?

01:49:27.686 --> 01:49:33.232
I tried to push the barrel away,
and it went off. And then it went off again.

01:49:33.316 --> 01:49:34.984
Hittin' your partner?

01:49:36.194 --> 01:49:39.154
And you never saw the man firin' the gun?

01:49:39.239 --> 01:49:41.156
No, sir, not at all.

01:49:41.199 --> 01:49:44.493
You're sure? If he was leanin'
in the window with a shotgun...

01:49:44.578 --> 01:49:46.662
I'm sure.

01:49:48.248 --> 01:49:51.083
I understand you quit the department?

01:49:51.167 --> 01:49:53.252
That's correct.

01:49:55.672 --> 01:49:58.007
You'll be someplace we can find you?

01:50:51.061 --> 01:50:53.479
The prosecution calls Kristen Cates.

01:51:07.994 --> 01:51:10.287
Raise your right hand and be sworn.

01:51:10.372 --> 01:51:13.457
Do you swear to tell the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

01:51:13.541 --> 01:51:15.417
- I do.
- Be seated.

01:51:19.756 --> 01:51:25.511
Miss Cates, you were an undercover
narcotics officer for the city of Katterly.

01:51:25.845 --> 01:51:29.598
- Yes, sir, I was.
- You don't currently hold that position.

01:51:29.683 --> 01:51:32.685
No, sir. I'm no longer
with the police department.

01:51:32.769 --> 01:51:36.939
- How long were you on the force?
- Approximately seven months.

01:51:37.273 --> 01:51:39.817
And you were responsible
for how many arrests?

01:51:39.901 --> 01:51:43.737
- I wouldn't know.
- Well, a hundred?

01:51:45.323 --> 01:51:47.825
Possibly. With my partner.

01:51:49.452 --> 01:51:52.204
Can you briefly describe that process?

01:51:52.372 --> 01:51:54.456
- The process?
- Yes.

01:51:57.293 --> 01:52:00.546
We purchased drugs, put what we bought
into evidence envelopes

01:52:00.630 --> 01:52:02.464
and turned them in to Captain Dodd.

01:52:03.842 --> 01:52:08.345
Miss Cates, would you read the name
and date on this envelope, please?

01:52:15.603 --> 01:52:18.272
"Gaines, William Robert."

01:52:18.982 --> 01:52:22.067
"May 31 st, 1975."

01:52:22.819 --> 01:52:25.821
Is this an envelope
you turned over to Captain Dodd?

01:52:25.947 --> 01:52:28.157
Yes, sir.

01:52:28.199 --> 01:52:30.534
Can you tell us what was inside it?

01:52:31.661 --> 01:52:32.995
Cocaine.

01:52:34.330 --> 01:52:37.583
- State exhibit, Your Honor.
- That's received.

01:52:40.128 --> 01:52:45.674
You and your partner
purchased this cocaine from Mr. Gaines?

01:52:48.136 --> 01:52:50.345
Miss Cates,

01:52:50.388 --> 01:52:54.475
did you and your partner
purchase this cocaine from Mr. Gaines?

01:53:00.023 --> 01:53:02.941
You testified under oath
in front of a grand jury

01:53:03.026 --> 01:53:07.738
that you and your partner
purchased this cocaine from Mr. Gaines.

01:53:12.368 --> 01:53:13.994
Miss Cates?

01:53:14.037 --> 01:53:18.081
Did you and your partner
purchase this cocaine from Mr. Gaines?

01:53:22.545 --> 01:53:23.879
No, sir.

01:53:27.383 --> 01:53:29.676
- It was a stash.
- Miss Cates?

01:53:29.719 --> 01:53:34.556
My partner and I were ordered by Chief
Nettle to falsify a case against Gaines.

01:53:35.141 --> 01:53:37.810
Your Honor,
the witness has committed perjury.

01:53:37.894 --> 01:53:40.437
Order in the court, please. Order!

01:53:41.231 --> 01:53:43.106
Order!

01:53:44.734 --> 01:53:47.319
The prosecution requests a mistrial.

01:55:06.733 --> 01:55:09.484
I told you sorry bastards
to stay outta my car.
