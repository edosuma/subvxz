EXECUTIVE PRODUCER
JEONG TAE-SUNG

02:17.096 --> 02:19.056
How hideous...

02:25.479 --> 02:31.443
A WEREWOLF BOY

02:34.446 --> 02:37.116
Turn off the TV.
It's distracting

02:37.116 --> 02:38.576
I'm watching it

02:38.784 --> 02:39.785
Any news from Eun-ju?

02:39.785 --> 02:44.123
She called yesterday
She says she misses you

02:44.290 --> 02:46.667
She couldn't tell me herself?

02:46.667 --> 02:49.461
It's nighttime here
when she calls

02:49.461 --> 02:52.381
I suspect she has a new boyfriend

02:52.756 --> 02:57.261
What? In Korea?
You should've kept your eye on her

02:57.261 --> 03:02.141
Good God,
listen to yourselves

03:02.224 --> 03:09.899
She's 19
She's supposed he dating

03:11.650 --> 03:12.735
Hello?

03:12.818 --> 03:13.777
Yes

03:13.777 --> 03:15.779
Does Mrs. Kim Suni live there?

03:16.363 --> 03:17.489
That's right

03:17.573 --> 03:19.158
May I speak to her, please?

03:19.200 --> 03:20.659
One moment, please

03:21.035 --> 03:23.954
Gran, there is a call
for you from Korea

03:24.288 --> 03:25.331
It must he Eun-ju

03:29.460 --> 03:31.170
Hi, sweetheart!

03:31.420 --> 03:34.548
Are you Mrs. Kim Suni?

03:35.341 --> 03:39.511
This is she

03:51.941 --> 03:54.526
I see...
Thank you

04:06.330 --> 04:08.874
Who was it?

04:09.416 --> 04:11.126
What's it about?

04:18.091 --> 04:22.638
I need to go to Korea

04:27.518 --> 04:31.814
PRODUCED BY
KIM SUJIN, YUN IN-BEOM

04:35.859 --> 04:40.155
WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY
JO SUNG-HEE

04:40.197 --> 04:41.448
Gran!

04:45.953 --> 04:47.913
Can you believe
I got a C on my midterm?

04:48.163 --> 04:55.337
My professors use such posh language
they don't even sound Korean

04:55.587 --> 05:02.261
The key is to doing it over and over
That's how you learn anything

05:05.681 --> 05:06.932
- Hello?
- Hi, mom

05:07.057 --> 05:09.643
- Did you meet her?
- We're in the car right now

05:09.768 --> 05:10.894
Where abouts are you?

05:12.104 --> 05:16.984
Gangwon-do, Hwacheon-gun,
Do...gae...

05:16.984 --> 05:18.444
- Where is that?
- Dogye...

05:18.444 --> 05:20.195
Put gran on the phone

05:20.279 --> 05:22.948
Okay.
Gran?

05:23.782 --> 05:26.744
Hi, it's me

05:27.036 --> 05:32.333
I had a good flight, ate well,
and I didn't forget my pills

05:32.333 --> 05:35.794
You should've let Eun-ju
take care of it

05:35.794 --> 05:37.629
It's no trouble

05:37.629 --> 05:41.508
Just make the sale
and come right home

05:43.844 --> 05:47.306
Is this where you used to live?

05:48.140 --> 05:51.643
Yeah, only briefly

05:54.646 --> 05:59.068
It looks kind of creepy now
Like a haunted house

05:59.151 --> 06:00.819
A haunted house?

06:03.155 --> 06:09.203
It was like that even hack then
A place fit for a monster

06:11.163 --> 06:12.956
How old were you?

06:16.001 --> 06:18.462
When I was about your age

06:19.380 --> 06:21.590
When I was as pretty as you

06:24.093 --> 06:25.427
Back then...

06:31.809 --> 06:40.692
47 years ago

07:55.726 --> 07:56.894
Quiet!

08:40.604 --> 08:43.148
I feel terrible
for troubling you like this

08:43.148 --> 08:45.192
- It's no trouble
- Thank you so much

08:45.317 --> 08:47.236
Thank you

08:47.653 --> 08:48.946
Get out of the way, Suni

08:52.199 --> 08:54.660
You must he the younger one

08:56.119 --> 08:59.081
Put that down, sweetheart
You should get some rest

08:59.331 --> 09:00.499
I'm all right

09:01.208 --> 09:02.834
Just that one, then

09:03.544 --> 09:06.838
Oh dear, that's a heavy one

09:07.005 --> 09:10.217
Neighbors should look out
for each other

09:11.301 --> 09:12.844
It's only right

09:12.844 --> 09:16.974
Stop running around, Dong-seok
You'll break that

09:16.974 --> 09:18.517
What a nice house!

09:21.270 --> 09:25.607
Hey, come and give us a hand here

09:28.527 --> 09:31.822
Let me get that
Please don't mind him

09:36.034 --> 09:40.372
What do you think? Plenty of fresh air,
the house isn't all that had either

09:41.415 --> 09:44.126
My summer house is in the area, too

09:44.209 --> 09:49.256
The fence was too high,
so I got rid of it

09:49.339 --> 09:53.552
Thank you
I'm forever in debt...

09:53.552 --> 09:57.014
- Stop it, mom
- What's the matter?

09:57.347 --> 09:58.557
That's my hall

09:58.557 --> 10:00.225
- Careful
- Look! A pig bladder

10:00.392 --> 10:02.936
Why won't you go inside, Suni?

10:05.022 --> 10:08.942
If it wasn't for you,
it would've taken us an eternity

10:08.942 --> 10:12.821
- Don't mention it
- Please help yourselves

10:13.071 --> 10:15.907
Sweethearts, did you say 'thank you'?

10:15.991 --> 10:18.201
- Thank you
- Thank you

10:18.452 --> 10:21.747
Dong-seok and Dong-mi,
did you thank Mrs. Kim for the food?

10:21.788 --> 10:23.081
- Thank you
- Thank you

10:23.081 --> 10:25.417
Half way through the meal?

10:25.500 --> 10:28.670
Mr. Kim is out of town?

10:32.966 --> 10:35.427
He passed away 2 years ago

10:36.261 --> 10:40.349
I do a little proofreading to
look after the girls

10:43.143 --> 10:49.107
I should invite the rest of the neighbors over
to say hello

10:49.358 --> 10:54.613
But this is the whole village
It's just us and Dong-seok's

10:55.072 --> 11:00.369
And there is a woman who lives with us
hut we rarely see her

11:00.452 --> 11:04.414
I've been here for 5 years

11:04.623 --> 11:07.125
and this is the first time
I've been inside this house

11:07.501 --> 11:12.422
How many bedrooms are there?
You have a telephone, too

11:13.006 --> 11:14.800
No-one lived here before us?

11:14.800 --> 11:15.717
Well,

11:19.221 --> 11:23.266
there was this man
hut we never got to know him

11:23.266 --> 11:26.812
He pretty much kept to himself
Hardly ever spoke at all

11:26.937 --> 11:31.525
And then...
Sweetie, can I have some more soup?

11:31.942 --> 11:37.322
Then, he died of a heart attack
Left undiscovered for a while, too

11:37.364 --> 11:44.371
In the barn outside, he kept
coyotes or wolves of some sort

11:44.371 --> 11:45.539
Wow!

11:45.956 --> 11:51.002
Why would he...?
For the meat?

11:51.086 --> 11:55.173
No, I think he did
some kind of study on them

11:55.674 --> 11:58.301
He would walk around with big books

11:58.427 --> 12:03.014
What gorgeous girls you have!
Schools are quite far away though

12:03.515 --> 12:08.353
The little one will go to Taeryeong Elementary
and the older one...

12:09.813 --> 12:12.858
Jeonghwa Girls' High School, right?

12:15.068 --> 12:17.237
Suni doesn't go to school

12:17.696 --> 12:23.285
I'm sorry I didn't prepare much
How is it?

12:23.285 --> 12:25.704
Please, we have plenty more food

12:25.996 --> 12:29.791
I'm gonna get something from the yard

12:31.376 --> 12:33.712
It's chilly out
Don't he too long

12:37.924 --> 12:44.723
We can't really afford this big place
hut we had to move for Suni

12:44.806 --> 12:47.726
Her doctor insisted

12:47.893 --> 12:49.227
What's wrong with her?

12:50.729 --> 12:53.732
It's her lungs

12:53.940 --> 12:58.737
She studies at home for her diploma

12:59.362 --> 13:05.076
I can't remember the last time
I saw a smile on her face

13:05.202 --> 13:07.496
She has no friends, either

13:07.496 --> 13:08.663
Honey...

13:09.122 --> 13:15.212
Poor little thing...
No wonder she is as pale as a ghost

13:15.253 --> 13:20.091
That's no big deal
I haven't set foot in a school my whole life

13:21.176 --> 13:24.262
Who was that slimeball from earlier?

13:24.513 --> 13:27.307
He is the son of my late
husbandâ€™s business partner

13:28.099 --> 13:30.101
- So, not one of yours?
- No

13:30.227 --> 13:34.940
I knew it!
He looked like a nasty man

13:34.940 --> 13:38.944
Watching old people work
with his hands in his pockets

13:38.944 --> 13:40.570
What was the slimeball doing here?

13:41.488 --> 13:43.907
It was the slimeball
that got us this place

14:15.689 --> 14:20.360
Only two other families in the entire village!
They seem nice though

14:20.610 --> 14:26.157
I'll leave the window open
and get the furnace running

14:27.158 --> 14:28.034
Your medicine?

14:28.034 --> 14:29.828
Just took it

14:30.495 --> 14:32.163
- How's the smell?
- Awful

14:32.205 --> 14:33.707
- Dust?
- I don't know

14:33.832 --> 14:40.547
Tomorrow, I'll give the place
a thorough scrub down

14:41.047 --> 14:42.340
Get some rest

14:43.425 --> 14:46.887
I think I will, darling

14:57.105 --> 14:59.691
Moonlight Melancholy
Do not touch! - Kim Suni

15:29.679 --> 15:32.390
Dark shadow inside meaningless being
Rot away and perish

15:32.474 --> 15:33.975
Drop dead, useless invalid!

16:01.419 --> 16:06.341
Wake up!
There is something outside

16:07.342 --> 16:09.302
Wake up, Sun-ja

16:09.427 --> 16:11.846
Mom, Suni won't leave me alone!

18:07.545 --> 18:09.964
Good Lord!
Suni? Was that you?

18:10.757 --> 18:14.260
Where did that come from?
Where is your sister?

18:14.552 --> 18:17.222
In there, mom

18:19.099 --> 18:22.227
- Oh my God, what happened?
- Why didn't you wake me?

18:22.310 --> 18:26.064
What were you doing out?

18:26.064 --> 18:28.566
Are you hurt? Here?

18:30.318 --> 18:33.530
How horrifying!
You should've called me

18:33.613 --> 18:38.159
Must have been a stray wolf
Is she okay?

18:38.493 --> 18:41.579
Just a scratch

18:41.579 --> 18:47.669
- I boiled some potatoes this morning
- Oh, you shouldn't have!

18:47.919 --> 18:50.713
I'm sure it won't come hack
Have a good day

18:54.509 --> 18:59.764
Leave that, honey
I'd rather you do some studying

18:59.764 --> 19:02.642
and get your diploma,
if you want to go to America

19:02.642 --> 19:04.144
Mom...?

19:04.602 --> 19:05.812
Yes?

19:07.730 --> 19:08.940
Look

19:10.108 --> 19:11.484
What's that?

19:13.111 --> 19:15.697
Good Lord! Mr. Jeong!

19:16.698 --> 19:18.283
Stay still

19:22.620 --> 19:24.289
Is that what you saw last night?

19:24.873 --> 19:27.375
It could he. I'm not sure

19:30.461 --> 19:31.629
Go away

19:33.715 --> 19:35.967
Shoo! Shoo!

19:45.894 --> 19:47.187
Come here

19:56.029 --> 19:58.448
Come on out, come on

20:05.079 --> 20:07.123
It's a human

20:08.082 --> 20:09.334
Who are you?

20:16.007 --> 20:18.009
You want this?

20:19.344 --> 20:20.345
Mom!

20:23.348 --> 20:26.726
Okay... Here, take it

20:43.368 --> 20:44.869
What's this smell?

20:44.953 --> 20:49.374
You want more? Yes?

20:49.457 --> 20:52.502
What are you doing, mom?
Just tell him to go away

20:52.502 --> 20:54.087
It's okay, sweetheart

21:14.649 --> 21:16.359
Why isn't he going?

21:16.401 --> 21:17.694
He can't talk?

21:17.819 --> 21:20.905
I think he understands though

21:20.905 --> 21:25.785
He is just some tramp
Just shoo him away

21:25.785 --> 21:32.125
Name unknown, age undetermined...
Damn!

21:32.667 --> 21:35.586
Do you have a pencil sharpener?

21:35.670 --> 21:38.589
What are you going to do about him?

21:38.965 --> 21:43.469
To he honest,
there isn't much we can do

21:45.388 --> 21:49.183
They say there are 60,000 children
orphaned by the war

21:49.892 --> 21:53.146
He looks about 17 or 18

21:53.354 --> 21:56.399
Orphanages won't take in
adolescents like him

21:57.025 --> 21:59.277
Is that a cut on his face?

21:59.944 --> 22:04.615
Jeez! What's wrong with him?
Was he abused as a child?

22:04.615 --> 22:10.621
Shouldn't you take him in
and look into the matter?

22:10.997 --> 22:14.959
That's our job all right hut
my captain will blow his lid

22:14.959 --> 22:18.046
Just throw him out

22:27.055 --> 22:31.684
I'll see what I can do
Can you look after him in the mean while?

22:31.684 --> 22:33.644
Why should I?

22:33.644 --> 22:37.940
Like I said, there are
some 60,000 war orphans

22:38.149 --> 22:43.154
A copy of application form,
3 copies of residence certificate,

22:43.154 --> 22:47.075
- a copy of income certificate,
- Sorry, can you slow down?

22:47.367 --> 22:51.329
certificate of taxation,
certificate for a surrender of guardianship,

22:51.329 --> 22:53.164
status report on the child under your care

22:53.664 --> 22:57.502
But I'm not his guardian...

22:57.502 --> 23:01.506
- Then, you should've gone to the police
- The police sent me here

23:01.506 --> 23:06.302
Just say you're the guardian
and declare surrender of custody

23:06.302 --> 23:08.846
Why would he go to an orphanage
if he has a guardian?

23:08.846 --> 23:12.975
Lady, we're going around in circles

23:18.314 --> 23:25.196
Then of course, there is an easier way

23:25.613 --> 23:27.031
What's that?

23:27.532 --> 23:29.867
How much did you pay him?

23:30.201 --> 23:31.577
Five hundred dollars

23:31.702 --> 23:36.541
Five hundred dollars?
What a thief!

23:39.877 --> 23:42.547
We'll have to get him cleaned first

23:43.423 --> 23:47.802
...and rush their ambition
to communize the world

23:48.386 --> 23:52.682
In his keynote speech, the director of
Central Intelligence Agency announced

23:52.682 --> 23:54.892
the launch of Anti-communism Center

23:54.976 --> 23:57.562
Forget your dreams
of taking over the world

23:59.063 --> 24:00.022
What the heck?

24:00.106 --> 24:03.818
Sweetie, can you find
some of dad's old clothes?

24:04.444 --> 24:05.736
You, come with me

24:20.418 --> 24:26.174
Hey! What are you doing?
That's for your hath. Don't drink that

24:27.175 --> 24:29.635
Stop growling and take off your clothes

24:29.719 --> 24:31.596
Come on
What an awful smell!

24:31.637 --> 24:36.184
You are not a child
I shouldn't have to do this for you

24:36.642 --> 24:41.063
At least you have the decency
to hold onto your pants

24:41.314 --> 24:45.109
I'll scrub your hack
hut the rest is up to you

24:47.778 --> 24:50.573
Are you asleep?

24:55.244 --> 24:58.122
- Where's mom?
- What a stench!

25:00.708 --> 25:05.296
Hey, come on!
Come and have your supper

25:05.922 --> 25:08.466
Food, over there

25:16.599 --> 25:20.645
Oh, dear...
What's wrong with him?

25:28.569 --> 25:31.489
- The poor thing must've starved...
- What are you gonna do about him?

25:32.782 --> 25:37.495
I talked to the county office today
They'll get in touch soon

25:37.537 --> 25:40.373
And until then?

25:42.458 --> 25:50.841
The officer has a lot of connections
It shouldn't take long

25:51.008 --> 25:54.178
How about we take care of him till then?

25:54.178 --> 25:55.346
What?

25:55.721 --> 26:02.186
Only for a few days
Can't just ignore him now

26:02.853 --> 26:07.191
Sweetheart, I promise you

26:09.902 --> 26:16.534
Be a good boy
and get some sleep, all right?

27:03.414 --> 27:06.292
Stop making funny noises

27:06.834 --> 27:09.086
You shouldn't do that at night
Come down

27:11.547 --> 27:13.549
Dog training manual

27:15.051 --> 27:19.764
How long is this unpacking
going to take?

27:21.265 --> 27:23.017
Honey, it'll spoil your appetite

27:23.726 --> 27:25.436
I'm not eating with him

27:27.313 --> 27:29.815
I'm going to the post office

27:30.316 --> 27:36.447
Are you going hack to studying
any time soon?

27:39.450 --> 27:42.870
I'm trying to find my hooks
Where are they?

28:14.485 --> 28:15.986
Go away

28:17.822 --> 28:19.240
Get away from me!

28:21.033 --> 28:23.994
Don't you come any closer

28:24.286 --> 28:25.871
Get away from me!
Hey!

28:25.996 --> 28:27.665
Mom!

28:29.166 --> 28:32.002
Mom!

29:02.324 --> 29:04.243
Do you want this?

29:18.758 --> 29:19.884
Anybody home?

29:20.801 --> 29:23.888
You're still unpacking?

29:24.221 --> 29:27.349
This is why you need a man
in the house

29:27.808 --> 29:29.018
Move over

29:38.402 --> 29:43.449
How come you're still unpacked
with 3 women in the house?

29:44.450 --> 29:47.036
What's that thing still doing here

29:47.077 --> 29:49.830
Please leave
I have to study

29:51.457 --> 29:55.795
Why would you need a diploma

29:56.921 --> 30:02.176
when all you gotta know is
how to cook a nice dinner for me?

30:02.176 --> 30:04.887
- Don't touch me
- Don't he like that

30:04.929 --> 30:12.019
I'm going to Seoul for a few days
How about a proper good bye?

30:24.406 --> 30:27.660
What the fuck?

30:28.118 --> 30:29.537
Jeez!

30:31.831 --> 30:33.249
You...

30:33.624 --> 30:35.084
You...

30:35.626 --> 30:37.419
Creep!

30:42.800 --> 30:44.343
Thanks

30:55.688 --> 30:59.692
- I can't get to the food
- Work your way around

31:01.360 --> 31:05.114
Hey, that's my rice!
Will you calm down a little?

31:19.545 --> 31:22.381
Dog training manual

31:27.094 --> 31:28.929
Do you know where he is?

31:29.346 --> 31:30.514
Who, Cheol-su?

31:30.848 --> 31:31.891
Cheol-su?

31:32.099 --> 31:35.269
I decided to call him that for now

31:35.853 --> 31:38.814
Your father wanted that name for a son,
If we ever had a boy

31:39.023 --> 31:43.861
Then, Sun-ja arrived and
I felt guilty even if it wasn't my fault

31:43.986 --> 31:45.738
So, where is he?

31:45.863 --> 31:50.117
Sun-ja took him outside
Can you believe that girl?

31:50.284 --> 31:54.121
We've only just moved in
and she's made friends with everyone

31:58.083 --> 31:59.335
Dong-seok!

32:01.629 --> 32:03.380
Wait for me

32:22.066 --> 32:23.400
You suck

32:23.484 --> 32:24.735
No, I don't

32:26.946 --> 32:31.116
I'll tell grandma that you left me out

32:31.408 --> 32:33.077
We'll let her have a go after this

32:34.536 --> 32:35.329
Okay

32:40.417 --> 32:41.377
Home run!

32:41.418 --> 32:43.253
No, that was a two-base hit

32:43.504 --> 32:47.424
Dong-mi, you're up next
Then, Cheol-su

32:48.801 --> 32:50.302
- Where did he go?
- Over there

32:50.386 --> 32:52.262
Cheol-su!

32:52.262 --> 32:54.056
Wow, he is fast

32:55.182 --> 32:57.476
Throw me the hall

32:58.560 --> 33:00.396
Throw it hard

33:00.437 --> 33:02.106
Come on

33:08.028 --> 33:10.239
You can't throw it like that

33:10.572 --> 33:12.324
Stupid Cheol-su

33:13.283 --> 33:15.995
Guys!

33:17.705 --> 33:20.457
Why won't you answer me?

33:21.083 --> 33:22.960
Oh God...

33:25.546 --> 33:26.797
Didn't you hear me?

33:27.089 --> 33:28.465
What have you got in your pocket?

33:30.134 --> 33:33.804
Cheol-su, when I say 'wait,'

33:34.304 --> 33:35.723
don't eat

33:37.516 --> 33:38.934
hut wait, okay?

33:39.685 --> 33:41.311
Here, w...

33:42.604 --> 33:43.397
...wait

33:43.397 --> 33:45.107
What is she doing?

33:47.067 --> 33:48.527
Let's go see the goats

33:48.819 --> 33:51.655
- Goats?
- Yeah, they eat paper

33:54.491 --> 34:01.665
When I say 'wait,' don't eat!
You should wait

34:02.374 --> 34:05.919
Don't... eat, got it?

34:06.795 --> 34:07.838
One more time

34:09.089 --> 34:11.007
I said 'wait,' you idiot!

34:12.384 --> 34:15.094
What?
What are you gonna do?

34:15.512 --> 34:18.389
No! Hey! No!

34:18.931 --> 34:22.811
Wait! No. Wait!

34:32.196 --> 34:33.322
Wait!

34:34.614 --> 34:38.118
See what you have done?

34:40.161 --> 34:44.958
You did good though
You wait like that, okay?

34:46.043 --> 34:50.714
Now, when I say 'eat,' you eat

34:51.172 --> 34:54.635
When I say 'eat,' eat like this

34:55.219 --> 34:56.219
Here

34:58.722 --> 34:59.765
Here we go

34:59.848 --> 35:00.849
Wait

35:01.892 --> 35:03.227
Not yet...

35:03.560 --> 35:04.895
Not yet...

35:05.187 --> 35:09.066
Good...

35:09.399 --> 35:12.236
That's a good boy

35:12.444 --> 35:13.737
Now ready?

35:15.239 --> 35:16.406
Eat

35:17.699 --> 35:19.159
I said 'eat'!

35:20.410 --> 35:21.954
I said 'eat'!

35:22.579 --> 35:25.415
When I say 'eat,' you eat like this

35:28.627 --> 35:30.504
Hold still

35:30.629 --> 35:32.631
I'm supposed to do this

35:35.634 --> 35:38.804
Good job, Cheol-su

35:39.596 --> 35:42.307
I'm not doing this because I like you

35:42.391 --> 35:43.934
I'm trying to work out a way

35:43.934 --> 35:45.686
to eat with you

35:50.899 --> 35:53.819
Now, one more time

35:55.070 --> 36:00.534
Who put this behind the wardrobe?
Was it you?

36:00.742 --> 36:01.785
Don't know

36:06.373 --> 36:08.208
I thought you weren't eating with him

36:08.208 --> 36:10.586
It's all right. Call him

36:14.548 --> 36:15.799
Dong-mi? Dong-seok?

36:19.303 --> 36:20.679
Guard your plates

36:20.679 --> 36:21.805
Wait

36:28.395 --> 36:29.438
Eat

36:31.440 --> 36:32.649
Wait

36:33.483 --> 36:35.319
Eat. Little at a time

36:40.490 --> 36:43.911
There's a good boy

36:48.832 --> 36:51.210
What? Let's eat

36:52.044 --> 36:55.172
...I fall into endless bottom
Death. Despair

37:01.136 --> 37:02.095
No!

37:03.180 --> 37:05.182
Wait, you naughty boy!

37:05.557 --> 37:07.142
Wait!

37:11.563 --> 37:13.148
Well done, Cheol-su

37:13.774 --> 37:16.151
Now spit out like this

37:21.198 --> 37:25.869
Fold it like this
You see?

37:27.371 --> 37:31.250
Put it in the wardrobe
Good job, Cheol-su

37:33.210 --> 37:37.547
...and tie the two ends
You're doing good

37:38.048 --> 37:42.386
Sun-ja can't do this yet
You learn fast

37:48.517 --> 37:50.477
Sure

37:57.359 --> 38:01.071
When did you last cut your hair?

38:03.824 --> 38:04.658
Are you asleep?

38:04.658 --> 38:08.036
We're going to the market
Get ready

38:08.829 --> 38:11.248
But I'm not done

38:11.248 --> 38:13.750
He looks great
Get ready now

38:13.834 --> 38:18.213
Cheol-su, we'll he hack real soon
There are some chestnuts in the kitchen

38:18.422 --> 38:19.840
No, wait...

38:22.175 --> 38:26.930
- Mom, can he come with us?
- If you want

38:27.055 --> 38:27.764
Come on

38:27.764 --> 38:33.854
Why are you wearing your slippers?
Put on some proper shoes. Hurry!

38:34.730 --> 38:37.983
What a tomboy!

38:39.776 --> 38:40.736
Move over

38:41.862 --> 38:44.448
I'm going! Chop, chop

38:44.448 --> 38:47.701
Cheol-su! Your sweater!

38:47.951 --> 38:50.329
Can I get some candy?

38:50.454 --> 38:53.332
No. It's had for your teeth

38:53.332 --> 38:55.459
How about this, then?

38:55.709 --> 38:59.838
Somebody please cover her eyes

39:11.892 --> 39:13.560
Are you getting me new trainers?

39:14.269 --> 39:18.565
No, something for Cheol-su
What do you think of these?

39:19.399 --> 39:21.026
Seriously?

39:21.318 --> 39:24.988
- They're old men's pants
- Cheol-su, darling?

39:25.155 --> 39:26.990
What do you think?
Nice, huh?

39:28.825 --> 39:30.202
Where did he go?

39:30.494 --> 39:33.038
He was right behind us

39:33.038 --> 39:35.082
- Cheol-su!
- Cheol-su!

39:35.332 --> 39:36.375
Cheol-su!

39:36.500 --> 39:38.585
Kim Cheol-su!
Where did he go?

39:41.046 --> 39:42.172
He's over there

39:45.217 --> 39:47.469
- Get your mom
- But I've got money

39:47.594 --> 39:49.930
There you go

39:50.847 --> 39:55.852
And one for the little one here

39:58.855 --> 40:01.817
Hey, what are you doing?

40:01.983 --> 40:03.735
You gotta pay before you eat!

40:03.735 --> 40:07.239
He'll pay
What are you yelling at him for?

40:07.364 --> 40:08.949
He's your son

40:09.533 --> 40:10.951
I want one, too

40:11.535 --> 40:12.869
Can we get two more?

40:13.995 --> 40:15.038
Go on, children

40:15.038 --> 40:18.208
You have beautiful kids

40:18.625 --> 40:21.169
I have two girls and a boy, myself

40:21.545 --> 40:26.216
Darling, you gotta chew your food

40:27.551 --> 40:28.885
- Here you go
- Thank you

40:28.885 --> 40:33.223
Don't take off like that again
Are you listening to me?

40:33.390 --> 40:35.684
You shouldn't wander off like that

41:17.392 --> 41:21.271
I think he should see a doctor

41:27.152 --> 41:32.699
He's gone a little red and
got a few scratches

41:33.283 --> 41:40.832
Is this the only medical facility around here?
I think I should take him to a real hospital

41:40.999 --> 41:45.462
You see, this huge iron beam fell
on top of him

41:46.004 --> 41:47.172
Get out

41:48.465 --> 41:51.968
- Oh, I didn't mean ...
- Get out

41:52.135 --> 41:58.767
I'm so sorry, I didn't mean any disrespect
It just came out wrong

41:58.975 --> 42:00.685
Sit down

42:01.144 --> 42:02.312
A real hospital?

42:02.979 --> 42:06.149
And I'm a fraud?
I run a good practice

42:06.274 --> 42:09.069
I've been serving this community
for over 30...

42:11.029 --> 42:14.533
for 30 whole years...

42:22.624 --> 42:25.544
Is it had?

42:25.544 --> 42:31.508
Take him to a bigger hospital some time

42:33.802 --> 42:35.762
This is called caramel

42:36.346 --> 42:38.598
We have more hut
have to wait till tomorrow

42:39.015 --> 42:40.892
Will you give us more tomorrow?

42:41.059 --> 42:41.977
Sure

42:42.686 --> 42:45.730
- We have dried persimmon at home
- What's that?

42:45.981 --> 42:48.233
- You don't know what dried persimmon is?
- What is it?

42:48.567 --> 42:51.236
Dried persimmon is dried persimmon

42:51.236 --> 42:53.488
Suni, are you coming with us?

42:59.160 --> 43:02.747
You're such a bother!
Where are you going?

43:02.747 --> 43:04.874
To see the goats
They look real scary

43:04.958 --> 43:07.127
- What's your 100 meter record?
- 20 seconds

43:08.336 --> 43:10.005
Cheol-su!

43:11.464 --> 43:13.133
This is for you

43:15.719 --> 43:18.972
It's a beanstalk
Give it water and it'll grow bigger

43:19.306 --> 43:23.059
- I can easily heat you
- Yeah, right

43:29.691 --> 43:32.444
You'll get in trouble for that

43:32.527 --> 43:34.237
It's okay. It's a used one

43:35.238 --> 43:36.615
Get your own!

43:39.075 --> 43:40.410
That's not it. Look

43:41.411 --> 43:43.747
No, it's like this

43:44.164 --> 43:45.707
- Right, sis?
- What?

43:46.082 --> 43:47.167
You try

43:47.834 --> 43:49.586
Try what?

43:49.628 --> 43:50.712
Come on

43:58.011 --> 44:01.806
To me it sounds more like...

44:11.024 --> 44:12.108
Don't laugh

44:12.233 --> 44:13.943
Mr. Jeong is coming

44:22.661 --> 44:26.081
Hey, were you laughing?
What's so funny?

44:26.581 --> 44:28.917
You try it then
Come on! Try!

44:34.172 --> 44:36.257
Chul-soo, what's with you!
Be quiet!

44:36.800 --> 44:37.967
What are you guys doing here?

44:38.385 --> 44:39.719
You kids fed papers again!

44:39.803 --> 44:41.429
- Guys! Run!
- Run!

44:41.429 --> 44:43.640
Told you thousand times
not to feed papers!

44:44.265 --> 44:45.100
Kids!

44:45.350 --> 44:47.769
You supposed to use them
for your homeworks

44:49.813 --> 44:51.481
Here I come

44:52.816 --> 44:53.983
No!

44:56.236 --> 44:57.028
Sun-ja!

44:57.112 --> 44:58.905
Pass the hall

44:59.114 --> 45:00.407
Go over there, Cheol-su

45:03.284 --> 45:05.495
No hands
You gotta kick it

45:09.791 --> 45:14.671
No! Fetch the hall

45:15.880 --> 45:18.675
Hey, wait... Yes!

45:18.675 --> 45:22.345
That's cheating!
Cheol-su, you're out

45:26.307 --> 45:28.852
I'm fine!
My hall!

45:31.521 --> 45:32.564
Yes

45:32.647 --> 45:35.525
Come with me for a second

45:37.360 --> 45:40.029
Good cooking

45:40.697 --> 45:42.198
It smells delicious

45:45.326 --> 45:46.244
Hot!

45:48.747 --> 45:52.584
- Dinner's ready
- Dinner's ready

45:53.293 --> 45:55.253
Dinner's ready

45:55.670 --> 45:57.922
Dinner's ready

46:13.146 --> 46:15.982
Mom, can I get a new baseball?

46:16.065 --> 46:17.609
Cheol-su lost mine last time

46:18.276 --> 46:19.611
Here we go again

46:19.694 --> 46:24.240
He threw it so hard that
it went as far as the goat pen

46:24.407 --> 46:27.744
So, Cheol-su is good at sports

46:28.620 --> 46:30.163
Maybe he should become an athlete

46:31.581 --> 46:35.210
How long is he going to stay with us?

46:35.502 --> 46:38.963
They're still trying to find
a good place for him

46:39.047 --> 46:42.759
There is a boy in my class
who lives in an orphanage

46:42.842 --> 46:45.929
He never brings lunch
and wears the same clothes everyday

46:48.014 --> 46:50.016
Well, it's not a nice place to live

46:57.732 --> 47:00.568
How dare you look down on me?

47:01.236 --> 47:04.614
I have more money than
all of you put together

47:06.157 --> 47:09.786
What are you mumbling about?

47:09.786 --> 47:13.623
You think you're better than me, too?

47:14.040 --> 47:18.586
Anyone who dares to challenge me
will he taught a lesson

47:18.920 --> 47:19.879
Got that?

47:19.963 --> 47:25.009
Are we going to your place
for another drink?

47:25.009 --> 47:30.348
You drink like a horse, girl
Want something other than ...

47:47.949 --> 47:52.412
You distracted me, stupid cow!

47:53.621 --> 47:54.622
What's that?

47:55.665 --> 47:57.417
It's that damn freak again

47:57.417 --> 48:01.087
- What are we gonna do?
- It's okay. He can't talk

48:02.171 --> 48:05.216
This is my landlord's house

48:08.303 --> 48:09.762
What just happened?

48:16.394 --> 48:17.604
You...

48:49.469 --> 48:50.637
Cheol-su

48:51.220 --> 48:53.222
You're up with the sun, aren't you?

48:53.556 --> 48:54.724
Come here

49:00.647 --> 49:04.943
Do you want to try speaking?

49:05.735 --> 49:12.742
Watch carefully and follow me
'Dee-geud'

49:15.495 --> 49:18.081
Come on, try

49:18.289 --> 49:21.834
Move your tongue like this

49:22.168 --> 49:23.711
'Dee-geud'

49:25.964 --> 49:27.256
Dee...

49:27.507 --> 49:30.510
That's right. 'Dee-geud'

49:34.764 --> 49:37.100
'Dee-geud'

49:43.564 --> 49:45.233
Stop staring at me like that

49:45.608 --> 49:48.861
Write the next one

49:53.449 --> 49:56.536
How hard can it he?
Just write it

49:56.536 --> 50:02.166
Draw a straight line, you see?

50:02.375 --> 50:04.669
Like so

50:08.548 --> 50:10.550
Your hands are very warm

50:12.760 --> 50:20.309
Keep doing it over and over
and eventually, you'll get it

50:27.150 --> 50:31.112
Come on, do the next one

50:36.701 --> 50:40.204
I haven't played in ages

50:40.204 --> 50:44.667
So I might not he as good,
hut I'll try anyway

50:44.959 --> 50:48.254
It's a song I wrote a while ago
You can't laugh

51:08.858 --> 51:14.864
All night long, I gaze out the window

51:17.408 --> 51:25.124
waiting for the sun to come up

51:25.917 --> 51:40.431
Because I can see him
when the morning comes

51:43.476 --> 51:51.067
Thank you for holding my hands

51:52.068 --> 51:59.784
Thank you for gazing into my eyes

52:01.035 --> 52:09.418
Thank you, prince of my dreams,

52:09.919 --> 52:17.927
for coming to me like this

52:47.707 --> 52:50.293
There is a second verse, too

52:56.883 --> 52:57.633
Hello?

52:57.633 --> 53:02.054
Mrs. Kim?
I'm calling from the county office

53:03.139 --> 53:04.307
What is this about?

53:04.307 --> 53:07.685
I looked into it and
an orphanage looks difficult

53:07.685 --> 53:12.356
but there is a facility for the disabled
that could take him in

53:13.482 --> 53:14.734
Mrs. Kim?

53:16.152 --> 53:17.403
There is no such person here

53:22.992 --> 53:26.621
What are you doing?
Did you stash food again?

53:26.913 --> 53:28.956
Don't even think about it
because I won't eat it

53:31.334 --> 53:34.045
How long have you been wearing
the same clothes?

53:34.295 --> 53:39.258
Mom says she'll get you new clothes
and always forgets

53:52.438 --> 53:54.815
Are you decent?

53:57.526 --> 54:01.697
This looks better than anything
you've ever put on

54:02.031 --> 54:03.157
Let me see

54:13.793 --> 54:15.836
You look hilarious

54:16.545 --> 54:18.172
Look at me! Look at me!

54:22.301 --> 54:26.639
You and I, we look ridiculous
Take a look

54:28.182 --> 54:30.351
Sweetheart, I'm home

54:34.647 --> 54:36.399
We gotta hide. Quick!

54:37.400 --> 54:41.237
Where did she go?
Her shoes are here

54:41.237 --> 54:42.321
Shush

54:42.321 --> 54:46.242
Aw, I've been holding this in
for too long

54:49.537 --> 54:53.457
Don't come out until I say so

54:53.457 --> 54:54.875
I'm home!

54:57.253 --> 54:58.170
Mom?

55:00.298 --> 55:03.092
- Where are you?
- I'm on the toilet

55:03.217 --> 55:06.220
- Hey, Sun-ja
- When did you get here?

55:06.470 --> 55:08.431
I've been calling you

55:10.099 --> 55:13.519
Why didn't you take this?

55:13.644 --> 55:16.564
But I wanted to help

55:16.605 --> 55:18.065
Where's Suni?

55:18.274 --> 55:20.109
Must he out with Cheol-su

55:20.443 --> 55:23.279
She never used to leave the house

55:23.487 --> 55:26.157
I'm worried she'll collapse again

55:30.619 --> 55:31.662
No, no!

55:48.429 --> 55:50.473
I'm gonna take some rest

55:51.766 --> 55:54.977
Eat your potatoes
and quit bothering me

56:02.485 --> 56:04.612
You kids shouldn't do
that kind of stuff

56:05.780 --> 56:08.783
Poor Mr. Jeong's goats
have all escaped

56:08.824 --> 56:10.659
Mom, where did you find this?

56:10.701 --> 56:13.746
You should've looked harder
before asking for a new one

56:13.829 --> 56:16.123
But, I did!

56:16.165 --> 56:21.796
You sure did... Take a quick peek
and come to me about everything

56:21.796 --> 56:23.255
Have you seen my pajamas?

56:23.506 --> 56:27.843
What's that you're wearing?
Pack your school hag and go to bed

56:27.927 --> 56:29.553
I'll pack in the morning

56:47.238 --> 56:49.824
Wait
Don't even think about it

58:22.500 --> 58:24.043
What are you doing here at this hour?

58:24.293 --> 58:27.922
You should show some respect

58:29.089 --> 58:36.680
Such an ungrateful brat, aren't you?

58:38.307 --> 58:41.769
Come with me
Let's grab a snack

58:42.937 --> 58:46.774
I just want to talk to you

58:49.443 --> 58:50.653
Cheol-su, stay

58:50.778 --> 58:54.156
Who've we got here?

58:55.783 --> 58:57.117
Come here

58:59.036 --> 59:00.162
Come here

59:01.830 --> 59:05.042
Why does he growl like a puppy?

59:08.629 --> 59:11.006
Keep messing with me,
and I'll marinate you in bean sauce...

59:32.528 --> 59:34.655
I'm only trying to help you up

59:35.531 --> 59:36.699
Don't!

59:36.907 --> 59:38.117
Hey, I'm not gonna eat you

59:41.704 --> 59:43.163
- What the heck?
- Holy crap!

59:45.666 --> 59:47.001
What's that?

59:48.210 --> 59:49.545
What happened to him?

59:50.379 --> 59:51.046
What happened to him?

01:00:14.153 --> 01:00:15.237
Do something!

01:00:28.292 --> 01:00:30.586
Get away from me

01:00:32.087 --> 01:00:34.006
Don't! I'm sorry

01:00:34.214 --> 01:00:39.678
I won't do it again, I promise
Dad!

01:00:40.596 --> 01:00:41.722
Wait

01:00:51.774 --> 01:00:52.900
Wait...

01:01:13.337 --> 01:01:14.713
A ghost?

01:01:16.298 --> 01:01:19.385
Suni, you saw him, too

01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:21.804
- Don't know what you're talking about
- What?

01:01:22.137 --> 01:01:29.395
She says you broke into the house
and tried to assault her

01:01:29.395 --> 01:01:30.854
Let's go to the station

01:01:31.063 --> 01:01:33.440
- Break in?
- Go to bed, Sun-ja

01:01:36.068 --> 01:01:37.653
Into my own house?

01:01:37.986 --> 01:01:41.323
And look who got heat up here

01:01:44.201 --> 01:01:46.203
Don't you know
who pays for your hospital hills?

01:01:46.787 --> 01:01:49.039
And this house?

01:01:49.039 --> 01:01:50.457
My father!

01:01:51.083 --> 01:01:55.003
It was my father's business
that your family joined later

01:01:56.463 --> 01:02:01.260
When he passed away,
you stole from the company

01:02:01.677 --> 01:02:05.889
I know about things
Bringing up hospital hills or this house

01:02:05.973 --> 01:02:08.934
won't do you any good
So, shut up!

01:02:08.934 --> 01:02:13.105
Sweetheart, what are you saying?
That's enough

01:02:13.105 --> 01:02:15.399
Have you lost your mind?

01:02:17.735 --> 01:02:19.069
That's it!

01:02:20.237 --> 01:02:27.327
Get rid of that freak
or move out of this house

01:02:27.536 --> 01:02:30.581
Fine, bring it on!

01:02:30.873 --> 01:02:33.917
Let's all go to the station together

01:02:34.209 --> 01:02:38.714
Officer, you saw the hats and knives
they wielded at me

01:02:39.047 --> 01:02:43.051
Why don't you call your father, too?

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:46.889
I have so many questions for him

01:02:47.347 --> 01:02:57.232
If you're not going to do that,
leave my family and Cheol-su alone

01:03:03.238 --> 01:03:04.406
Steady, son

01:03:07.409 --> 01:03:09.995
This is fucking ludicrous

01:03:12.748 --> 01:03:13.874
Think you're so smart?

01:03:14.082 --> 01:03:15.626
Please, Ji-tae!

01:03:15.626 --> 01:03:16.418
You have any idea

01:03:18.003 --> 01:03:21.048
- who my father is?
- Please stop him

01:03:27.179 --> 01:03:31.350
Cheol-su, what was that earlier?

01:03:38.106 --> 01:03:39.525
Don't worry. It's gonna he fine

01:03:44.988 --> 01:03:48.867
So you had some drinks before?

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:55.374
Some rice wine...
Just a little, eh?

01:03:55.666 --> 01:03:57.626
- Come on, stay put
- Just a little Venus

01:03:57.626 --> 01:04:04.299
Oh, Whiskey!
Foreign alcohol can screw you up real had

01:04:04.299 --> 01:04:06.635
You don't believe me?

01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:15.853
We were minding our own business
when that freak attacked us

01:04:15.853 --> 01:04:21.108
and killed us all
Put the damn freak away!

01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:25.571
No-one died. Just minor injuries
You little piece of shit!

01:04:26.196 --> 01:04:30.492
Why did you stir up trouble
in the middle of the night?

01:04:30.659 --> 01:04:32.244
- Officer...
- Shut up!

01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:36.123
They're regulars here

01:04:37.749 --> 01:04:42.212
The situation doesn't look
so good for you

01:04:42.254 --> 01:04:45.924
Destruction of private property,
breaking and entering and assault...

01:04:47.009 --> 01:04:49.803
And it's not really my business hut

01:04:49.803 --> 01:04:54.975
what was that about
embezzling company funds?

01:04:55.517 --> 01:04:57.227
Calm down, sweetheart

01:04:57.519 --> 01:05:00.981
Why don't we call it a night here?
Come on, let's all go home

01:05:01.064 --> 01:05:04.026
- Let's not bring suits between neighbors
- You're absolutely right, officer

01:05:04.026 --> 01:05:06.778
I'm sure you can talk things out

01:05:06.904 --> 01:05:08.614
Officer, can you uncuff him?

01:05:12.159 --> 01:05:15.871
The smell is suffocating me

01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:18.415
Doesn't it bother you?

01:05:18.707 --> 01:05:21.084
What smell?

01:05:23.879 --> 01:05:26.798
What a stench!

01:05:53.951 --> 01:05:55.869
What are the hooks for?

01:05:55.869 --> 01:05:57.788
They belong to him

01:06:02.250 --> 01:06:06.254
You didn't happen to call my father,
did you?

01:06:06.964 --> 01:06:08.924
Of course not

01:06:09.007 --> 01:06:13.595
I'm letting this pass because
I don't want any more trouble

01:06:13.845 --> 01:06:14.596
I know

01:06:14.596 --> 01:06:20.560
Why should we fight like this
when Suni will marry me one day?

01:06:21.478 --> 01:06:24.439
Let's try to get on a little

01:06:26.692 --> 01:06:29.528
Where did you find a freak like that?

01:06:30.779 --> 01:06:34.950
You can't let him leave this room

01:06:36.076 --> 01:06:37.786
He's dangerous

01:06:47.004 --> 01:06:49.548
What's all this?

01:06:50.298 --> 01:06:57.014
Must belong to the former owner
Last of what I found

01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:13.822
Park Jong-du?

01:07:23.415 --> 01:07:25.834
Professor Kang?

01:07:26.668 --> 01:07:28.336
Who the hell are you?

01:07:29.921 --> 01:07:33.091
Do you know a man called
Park Jong-du?

01:07:34.342 --> 01:07:37.054
I saw something interesting
and wondered

01:07:38.597 --> 01:07:42.267
and wondered
if you knew anything about it

01:07:54.029 --> 01:07:55.322
Sit

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:00.994
Stay down
Your legs will hurt

01:08:03.914 --> 01:08:05.040
Sit

01:08:05.624 --> 01:08:06.750
and wait!

01:08:09.878 --> 01:08:13.090
The smell won't go away
no matter how hard I clean

01:08:13.673 --> 01:08:16.801
It's cold out
Why don't you go inside?

01:08:16.885 --> 01:08:18.720
It's too stuffy inside

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:22.390
You've been working hard lately

01:08:23.558 --> 01:08:27.895
That makes me feel so proud

01:08:28.688 --> 01:08:33.318
To go to college
Then I will he a teacher

01:08:33.859 --> 01:08:36.947
I think
I'm quite talented

01:08:39.491 --> 01:08:42.452
Mom, aren't you going out
anywhere today?

01:08:43.828 --> 01:08:46.622
I'm going into town to post
some manuscripts

01:08:47.582 --> 01:08:49.292
You are fine with that, right?

01:08:51.044 --> 01:08:54.506
Sure I am...
What are you talking about?

01:08:57.259 --> 01:09:00.845
Don't... get too attached to
Chul-soo

01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:21.992
I only came in
because it was getting cold

01:09:25.537 --> 01:09:26.912
You can stop waiting now

01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:34.587
Is that supposed to he me?

01:09:40.635 --> 01:09:41.970
I can't

01:09:43.138 --> 01:09:45.015
I don't have that anymore

01:09:47.475 --> 01:09:49.810
But I brought you something else

01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:51.229
Ta-ta!

01:09:55.108 --> 01:10:01.031
My dad bought this for me
hut I never read it

01:10:01.156 --> 01:10:04.326
And I won't he reading it now

01:10:04.826 --> 01:10:07.037
because you're gonna read it for me

01:10:08.038 --> 01:10:13.835
When you have learned to read and talk,
read it to me

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:18.173
I'll stroke your hair a hundred times

01:10:18.506 --> 01:10:21.343
That's an order

01:10:21.343 --> 01:10:25.430
Do you know what a snow man is?
Have you ever seen snow?

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:30.518
You make one
by rolling snow into a hall

01:10:30.518 --> 01:10:32.604
We'll make one together
when it snows

01:10:32.687 --> 01:10:38.068
On top of the hill where we played hall
It'll he so much fun

01:10:38.193 --> 01:10:39.236
Promise?

01:10:41.696 --> 01:10:43.365
Like this

01:10:48.036 --> 01:10:50.705
Now, go hack to your study

01:11:05.887 --> 01:11:07.889
It's stuffy in here

01:11:12.727 --> 01:11:13.687
Hey!

01:11:24.197 --> 01:11:26.658
Where have you been all this time?

01:11:27.325 --> 01:11:30.412
Why haven't you learned to talk?

01:11:32.205 --> 01:11:35.583
At least you're super strong

01:11:35.959 --> 01:11:41.047
I'm not good at anything

01:11:43.758 --> 01:11:49.681
You're a good boy, aren't you?
You're never going to hurt people again

01:11:50.056 --> 01:11:52.600
You have so much more to learn
from me

01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:56.938
Will you stay with me forever?

01:12:00.525 --> 01:12:02.610
Say 'yes'

01:12:04.279 --> 01:12:07.073
Yea...

01:12:12.454 --> 01:12:18.877
See the pile of stones down there?

01:12:19.878 --> 01:12:24.090
I'll race you
Whoever gets there first wins a favor

01:12:26.801 --> 01:12:29.721
We'll start at three, okay?

01:12:30.388 --> 01:12:33.141
One, two!

01:13:54.556 --> 01:13:56.724
There's no-one home

01:13:59.394 --> 01:14:01.020
Dong-seok's at school

01:14:24.085 --> 01:14:25.503
- Suni!
- Kim Suni!

01:14:28.506 --> 01:14:31.259
Cheol-su!
Suni!

01:14:33.428 --> 01:14:34.679
Miss Kim Suni!

01:14:34.679 --> 01:14:36.222
- Suni! Cheol-su!
- Kim Suni!

01:14:36.222 --> 01:14:37.849
Where did they go?

01:14:37.849 --> 01:14:39.309
Look over there

01:14:39.434 --> 01:14:43.688
She's with Cheol-su
Stop crying, mom

01:14:43.688 --> 01:14:51.696
I knew this was hound to happen
sooner or later

01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:54.782
How did he get past the lock?

01:14:54.866 --> 01:14:57.619
- Cheol-su!
- Suni!

01:14:58.786 --> 01:15:03.416
- Who are these people?
- I don't know

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:04.626
We found them

01:15:04.626 --> 01:15:08.129
Where?
Where are they?

01:15:08.254 --> 01:15:09.964
- Suni!
- Where?

01:15:10.048 --> 01:15:11.174
Suni!

01:15:11.174 --> 01:15:12.717
Calm down, Mrs. Kim

01:15:13.051 --> 01:15:15.345
- What are you doing?
- Just stand hack

01:15:15.803 --> 01:15:17.138
Hey!

01:15:17.263 --> 01:15:19.057
- What are you doing?
- Stand hack, kid

01:15:19.057 --> 01:15:20.517
It's an anesthetic gun

01:15:20.517 --> 01:15:22.894
You're trying to shoot him with it?

01:15:22.894 --> 01:15:25.271
Kiddo, it's dangerous

01:15:25.355 --> 01:15:28.483
Come on, Cheol-su
Let's go home

01:15:31.569 --> 01:15:36.950
Good Lord! Suni!
Are you all right, sweetheart?

01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:38.743
Wake up, child!

01:15:41.829 --> 01:15:45.959
She shouldn't come this far out

01:15:51.297 --> 01:15:58.304
Wolves are social predators
that live in packs

01:15:58.304 --> 01:16:02.767
and are known
for their remarkable persistence

01:16:03.017 --> 01:16:06.563
They can survive
without food for a long time

01:16:07.230 --> 01:16:10.692
and mate with just one partner for life

01:16:10.692 --> 01:16:13.861
What on earth are you talking about?

01:16:14.571 --> 01:16:16.948
Was that too complicated?

01:16:17.865 --> 01:16:27.500
Dr. Park wanted to create super soldiers
that can carry out effective infiltration

01:16:28.042 --> 01:16:30.420
Where do I start?

01:16:30.545 --> 01:16:35.800
So, what you're saying is
that's not a human-being hut a beast

01:16:36.134 --> 01:16:40.597
Park and I worked together
in the same field

01:16:40.722 --> 01:16:46.185
and we were good friends
So, he sent me this letter saying ...

01:16:46.185 --> 01:16:51.733
Let's not talk about things
that need not he mentioned

01:16:56.362 --> 01:16:58.823
Can I get something to drink?

01:16:58.990 --> 01:16:59.907
Of course

01:16:59.907 --> 01:17:05.371
His experiment had serious moral dilemmas
as it involved human subjects

01:17:05.413 --> 01:17:14.422
If this gets out,
it'll become a huge scandal

01:17:15.465 --> 01:17:20.470
Whoever commissioned this project ...

01:17:23.765 --> 01:17:26.768
There is no evidence that the government
was involved with his project

01:17:26.768 --> 01:17:28.603
I never mentioned any government

01:17:28.603 --> 01:17:31.606
It was entirely his private work

01:17:31.773 --> 01:17:32.857
Gross

01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:36.235
- Don't delve too deep into this
- I never wanted to

01:17:36.235 --> 01:17:42.283
We'll need to take Cheol-su with us
for some testing

01:17:42.492 --> 01:17:46.079
I made myself clear on the matter

01:17:46.412 --> 01:17:51.042
No-one outside can know about him
He is not to leave this premise

01:17:51.042 --> 01:17:55.088
Why are you so concerned about
someone's private research work?

01:17:55.213 --> 01:17:58.675
Why do you have so many questions?

01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:02.887
I'm not sure of the details either

01:18:04.222 --> 01:18:07.809
We'll observe him for a few days

01:18:07.809 --> 01:18:11.521
If it turns out he was part of
the wretched experiment,

01:18:11.979 --> 01:18:15.817
we have no choice
hut to put him down

01:18:17.694 --> 01:18:18.820
You're going to kill him?

01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:24.075
We can't afford to let this...
I mean, the boy to get out

01:18:24.075 --> 01:18:29.831
I'm not following you at all

01:18:29.831 --> 01:18:35.837
But you got this all wrong
Cheol-su is a good kid even if he can't talk

01:18:35.837 --> 01:18:39.298
Even after what you saw today?

01:18:39.841 --> 01:18:46.472
If we'd arrived a little later,
he'd have eaten her

01:18:49.308 --> 01:18:53.312
You should've never taken him in
Grrr!

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:57.650
Careful, sweetie

01:19:03.698 --> 01:19:05.491
It's okay, honey

01:19:06.784 --> 01:19:08.202
We'll he hack in no time

01:19:08.286 --> 01:19:10.955
Bring him his meal

01:19:11.581 --> 01:19:13.124
See you later, Suni

01:19:15.752 --> 01:19:19.589
Let me take that

01:19:30.183 --> 01:19:33.811
Practice your writing
I'll he right hack, okay?

01:19:34.187 --> 01:19:38.316
Eat plenty and don't
make noises at night

01:19:51.245 --> 01:19:52.997
He's trying to escape

01:19:57.794 --> 01:19:58.711
Suni

01:20:01.005 --> 01:20:01.798
Are you okay?

01:20:01.798 --> 01:20:02.924
Wait

01:20:06.636 --> 01:20:10.264
Wait, Cheol-su

01:20:20.942 --> 01:20:23.110
I told you he is dangerous

01:20:23.569 --> 01:20:25.488
If this happens again

01:20:26.447 --> 01:20:29.200
- Swear to God I'll shoot him
- Shoot him?

01:20:29.617 --> 01:20:35.581
Don't you touch a hair on his head

01:20:41.629 --> 01:20:43.381
Let's go

01:20:52.431 --> 01:20:53.641
- Hey!
- Yes, sir

01:20:53.683 --> 01:20:55.643
Isn't there anything to eat?

01:21:01.774 --> 01:21:04.068
What on earth is he doing?

01:21:04.151 --> 01:21:06.612
Learning the alphabets
Ga, na, da, la...

01:21:06.696 --> 01:21:07.613
What for?

01:21:07.989 --> 01:21:10.241
You gotta learn what you don't know

01:21:10.783 --> 01:21:17.331
As you see, there isn't much movement
other than occasional staring at the door

01:21:17.331 --> 01:21:18.708
Why isn't he eating?

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.793
Because Suni isn't here

01:21:21.168 --> 01:21:22.253
Freezing!

01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:30.177
If he shows a hint of violent behavior,

01:21:30.636 --> 01:21:32.346
we'll put him down

01:21:33.431 --> 01:21:39.103
I can tell from a glance
whether someone is a danger or not

01:21:46.027 --> 01:21:47.904
His blood type is indeterminable

01:21:48.821 --> 01:21:49.655
What about other readings?

01:21:49.655 --> 01:21:52.950
His vision, hearing and sense of smell
are all good

01:21:53.367 --> 01:21:55.119
Too good, actually

01:21:55.369 --> 01:21:56.746
His body temperature is a little high

01:21:56.913 --> 01:21:57.955
How high?

01:21:58.456 --> 01:21:59.665
114.8 Â°F
It's not a fever

01:21:59.749 --> 01:22:02.835
He is naturally hot

01:22:03.127 --> 01:22:09.300
And he has a hone density and
muscle power that matches an elephant

01:22:15.222 --> 01:22:19.060
If anyone asks,
tell them all the readings are normal

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:20.770
Sir?

01:22:21.062 --> 01:22:22.980
If we don't take him with us,

01:22:24.065 --> 01:22:26.233
he'll he killed here

01:22:27.777 --> 01:22:30.071
- Sun-ja!
- Cheol-su!

01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:32.239
Wanna spin a top?

01:22:32.239 --> 01:22:34.575
It just rained, idiot

01:22:34.951 --> 01:22:37.954
I have to stay home
Cheol-su can't play either

01:22:38.079 --> 01:22:39.080
Why not?

01:22:39.956 --> 01:22:43.876
Just can't...
Next time, okay?

01:23:02.311 --> 01:23:05.272
It was a temporary shock
Nothing to worry about

01:23:05.523 --> 01:23:08.442
Her conditions have
improved dramatically

01:23:08.442 --> 01:23:10.987
- It's amazing what a change of air can do
- Oh, thank you, doctor!

01:23:11.195 --> 01:23:13.447
- I got so worried
- Mom

01:23:15.199 --> 01:23:16.534
Let's go home, mom

01:23:16.951 --> 01:23:24.000
Everything is normal

01:23:24.750 --> 01:23:28.129
He seems to he
quite gentle by nature

01:23:28.212 --> 01:23:33.634
He's one of those kids
who lost parents in the war

01:23:33.634 --> 01:23:35.344
There are tons of orphans like him

01:23:35.469 --> 01:23:36.846
That's right

01:23:36.846 --> 01:23:39.223
He's so much cleaner than me

01:23:39.265 --> 01:23:41.559
I sometimes forget to brush
my teeth before bed

01:23:41.559 --> 01:23:43.561
hut he brushes his teeth
even after lunch

01:23:43.561 --> 01:23:44.770
Colonel

01:23:44.854 --> 01:23:46.647
What are you saying?

01:23:46.939 --> 01:23:49.150
You said you can tell from a glance

01:23:49.483 --> 01:23:50.651
Didn't I tell you

01:23:50.943 --> 01:23:53.654
that he turns into a monster?

01:23:53.946 --> 01:23:56.782
He is different from us

01:23:56.866 --> 01:23:59.368
He can't talk and is freakishly strong

01:23:59.493 --> 01:24:02.580
He is a satan

01:24:03.873 --> 01:24:06.500
What do you mean by that?

01:24:06.792 --> 01:24:10.671
I don't have time on my hands

01:24:10.796 --> 01:24:13.799
Can't he sitting around here all day

01:24:41.202 --> 01:24:44.705
You can stop waiting now
Come here

01:25:05.017 --> 01:25:10.856
My conclusion is that, although he lacks
social skills having been raised by animals,

01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:14.235
he is capable of learning and
has the will to learn

01:25:15.069 --> 01:25:20.407
Pending further observation,
hurting that boy will he

01:25:20.866 --> 01:25:22.743
a meaningless murder

01:25:22.743 --> 01:25:25.121
He has never displayed
violent tendencies

01:25:25.121 --> 01:25:29.083
If that's true,
I'll report hack and return to base

01:25:29.166 --> 01:25:31.752
He is so handsome, too

01:25:32.878 --> 01:25:35.464
He reminds me of my nephew

01:25:35.589 --> 01:25:37.091
I saw him

01:25:39.343 --> 01:25:41.971
I saw him hurting goats

01:25:42.763 --> 01:25:43.764
When?

01:25:43.973 --> 01:25:47.768
A couple of weeks ago
At night

01:25:47.893 --> 01:25:50.396
You were with him that night?

01:25:52.439 --> 01:25:53.983
What happened?

01:25:54.191 --> 01:25:56.986
We were driving when we saw him

01:25:58.112 --> 01:26:01.532
hunting Mr. Jeong's goat

01:26:01.532 --> 01:26:03.159
He was hunting a goat?

01:26:03.409 --> 01:26:04.535
How?

01:26:04.618 --> 01:26:05.286
Pardon?

01:26:05.286 --> 01:26:09.623
He was feasting on it like a wolf

01:26:09.707 --> 01:26:12.084
Why are you telling us this now?

01:26:12.293 --> 01:26:14.378
I was scared he might hurt me

01:26:14.378 --> 01:26:18.299
If you were there with her,
why didn't you say something before?

01:26:19.008 --> 01:26:20.092
I'm telling you now

01:26:20.092 --> 01:26:23.387
You know you're such a shitty liar

01:26:23.637 --> 01:26:28.309
If you're gonna make up a story,
at least make some effort

01:26:28.642 --> 01:26:32.646
Who's calling who a liar?

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:37.818
Mr. Jeong, you know
that Cheol-su didn't do it

01:26:38.569 --> 01:26:41.572
Did you see him hurt your goat?

01:26:41.822 --> 01:26:45.117
- I didn't see him prey on it
- But?

01:26:45.117 --> 01:26:50.122
I saw him at the goat pen that night

01:26:50.122 --> 01:26:52.833
Do you still have the dead goat?

01:26:52.958 --> 01:26:58.255
No
But it wasn't killed by a wild animal

01:26:58.255 --> 01:27:01.425
- I saw it with my own eyes
- Stop lying

01:27:01.425 --> 01:27:02.760
You little hitch...

01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:06.680
Hey, watch your mouth!
Don't you see that I'm here?

01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:08.599
You have no respect

01:27:11.685 --> 01:27:14.355
You all have lost your minds

01:27:14.688 --> 01:27:18.692
All this nonsense because
you can't put down an animal?

01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:23.989
We'll examine the site tomorrow
Everyone go home for now

01:27:23.989 --> 01:27:25.866
Get some rest, sweetie

01:27:28.202 --> 01:27:29.411
Suni

01:27:34.583 --> 01:27:36.710
Don't you remember when...

01:27:38.045 --> 01:27:43.592
we had a pinkie-swear
we'd he together forever and ever

01:28:03.279 --> 01:28:04.113
What do you want?

01:28:04.113 --> 01:28:05.656
I have something to say

01:28:06.031 --> 01:28:08.409
What?

01:28:10.744 --> 01:28:12.997
Cheol-su would have jumped over

01:28:13.497 --> 01:28:14.623
What?

01:28:16.125 --> 01:28:20.421
If it was Cheol-su,
he'd have cleared it easy

01:28:20.754 --> 01:28:23.549
hut the fence was hacked apart

01:28:25.217 --> 01:28:29.638
The dead goat had no open wounds,
only broken ribs

01:28:30.472 --> 01:28:32.641
Bring your car around tomorrow

01:28:32.933 --> 01:28:34.393
I want to check something

01:28:35.936 --> 01:28:39.648
I put some straw mats over the track

01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:42.234
I'm going to show them tomorrow

01:28:42.693 --> 01:28:46.947
What do you want from me?

01:28:46.947 --> 01:28:49.241
If you've been telling a lie,
come clean

01:28:49.283 --> 01:28:51.118
and I'll keep my mouth shut

01:28:51.410 --> 01:28:56.081
Stop hassling good people
and go hack to Seoul

01:29:08.969 --> 01:29:09.803
Hey, Jeong!

01:29:15.434 --> 01:29:16.518
Hello?

01:29:17.311 --> 01:29:18.145
Excuse me?

01:29:18.187 --> 01:29:19.063
Who is it?

01:29:19.063 --> 01:29:21.065
- It's a reporter
- A reporter?

01:29:21.190 --> 01:29:22.983
He wants to come by for
some questions tomorrow

01:29:22.983 --> 01:29:25.069
Hang up the phone

01:29:25.069 --> 01:29:27.696
Shouldn't you he packing?
Journalists are coming

01:29:27.696 --> 01:29:29.698
Don't he ridiculous

01:29:29.698 --> 01:29:31.492
Change him hack into his own clothes
Just in case

01:30:04.483 --> 01:30:06.235
Did you...

01:30:09.488 --> 01:30:11.490
Did you hurt the goat?

01:30:18.747 --> 01:30:20.165
I'm going hack in

01:30:35.681 --> 01:30:40.144
I'm sick of these country bumpkins

01:30:44.648 --> 01:30:47.234
- Go and take a look
- Yes, sir

01:30:47.234 --> 01:30:49.528
Damned blackouts

01:31:17.556 --> 01:31:18.807
What the heck?

01:31:21.810 --> 01:31:23.187
Hey...

01:31:27.399 --> 01:31:29.443
Ma'am, it's completely hashed up

01:31:29.443 --> 01:31:31.111
What's hashed up?

01:31:31.111 --> 01:31:32.821
Do you have a screw driver?

01:31:32.946 --> 01:31:34.198
One moment

01:31:34.615 --> 01:31:38.869
I just wanted to talk to you

01:31:49.338 --> 01:31:53.467
I'm sorry I've been an asshole to you

01:31:55.969 --> 01:31:58.847
How are you holding up, man?

01:31:59.139 --> 01:32:01.517
You know what happened
to the guitar?

01:32:01.642 --> 01:32:03.852
You know,
the thing you sing along to

01:32:08.774 --> 01:32:12.611
Suni's been feeling down lately

01:32:13.612 --> 01:32:15.155
Her guitar's gone missing

01:32:16.365 --> 01:32:23.330
She can't sing,
so her health is getting worse

01:32:24.998 --> 01:32:27.000
She might eventually die, you know?

01:32:29.169 --> 01:32:31.255
You know who's taken it?

01:32:32.005 --> 01:32:34.174
Jeong did

01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:37.636
You know, the guy that keeps goats

01:32:37.719 --> 01:32:40.389
Who would do this?

01:32:41.515 --> 01:32:43.684
It's a secret hut

01:32:45.644 --> 01:32:50.023
Suni doesn't really like you

01:32:51.191 --> 01:32:52.651
In fact, she hates you

01:33:01.827 --> 01:33:05.706
Bring the guitar hack to her

01:33:08.667 --> 01:33:12.921
Who knows?
She might like you a little for that

01:33:16.425 --> 01:33:17.926
Go get it now

01:33:19.845 --> 01:33:21.054
It's hack on

01:33:21.054 --> 01:33:22.931
- That's a relief
- It's hack on

01:33:27.227 --> 01:33:28.395
Where did he go?

01:33:29.354 --> 01:33:30.564
Oh my God,

01:33:31.565 --> 01:33:34.568
the boy has gone nuts

01:33:42.826 --> 01:33:44.328
What happened to you?

01:33:44.411 --> 01:33:46.371
How did he get out?

01:33:47.831 --> 01:33:49.708
Where on earth did he go?

01:33:49.791 --> 01:33:50.876
We'll look for him

01:33:50.959 --> 01:33:52.753
He's gone to Jeong's farm

01:33:53.420 --> 01:33:55.088
He's craving the taste of meat

01:33:55.088 --> 01:33:59.009
How do you know that?

01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:00.969
I saw him on the way here

01:34:00.969 --> 01:34:03.555
Where is this place?
Lead us there

01:34:05.849 --> 01:34:08.435
You might want to bring the real gun

01:34:22.115 --> 01:34:23.992
What's going on?

01:34:24.284 --> 01:34:25.410
Who's there?

01:34:27.287 --> 01:34:28.497
Cheol-su?

01:34:29.289 --> 01:34:30.999
Hey, what are you doing?

01:34:31.792 --> 01:34:37.381
What's gotten into you?

01:34:37.381 --> 01:34:38.799
Stop it!

01:34:54.064 --> 01:34:56.066
What's happening?

01:34:56.149 --> 01:34:58.777
- Colonel?
- Go get the lady

01:34:58.819 --> 01:35:01.321
- Hey!
- Are you all right, sir?

01:35:01.321 --> 01:35:03.657
Mr. Jeong, are you okay?

01:35:11.164 --> 01:35:12.416
What are you doing?

01:35:13.417 --> 01:35:15.168
You thief!

01:35:16.545 --> 01:35:18.338
Help me

01:35:21.550 --> 01:35:22.801
Kim Cheol-su!

01:35:24.177 --> 01:35:28.098
Put your hands in the air
and come out of there

01:35:31.101 --> 01:35:32.728
- Come out of there now
- This way, ma'am

01:35:33.729 --> 01:35:35.689
Oh my God! Honey?

01:35:35.689 --> 01:35:39.192
What happened to you?

01:35:40.819 --> 01:35:41.987
Wake up, Mr. Jeong!

01:35:42.487 --> 01:35:43.488
What the hell?

01:35:43.488 --> 01:35:44.698
What is she doing?

01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:45.699
Hey!

01:35:45.824 --> 01:35:46.825
Where are you going?

01:35:47.826 --> 01:35:48.702
Stop!

01:35:48.952 --> 01:35:53.582
Oh my God! Sweetie!
Come hack here

01:35:53.665 --> 01:35:55.208
Let me talk to him

01:35:56.668 --> 01:35:59.004
That's my daughter
Put the rifle away

01:35:59.004 --> 01:36:00.464
Come on, shoot him

01:36:00.464 --> 01:36:02.215
Shut your mouth for once

01:36:02.382 --> 01:36:07.387
You're pointing the gun at my child
What if she gets hurt?

01:36:08.597 --> 01:36:10.015
Cheol-su...

01:36:15.479 --> 01:36:17.230
It's not here

01:36:21.735 --> 01:36:22.861
Come to me

01:36:40.128 --> 01:36:41.171
What the hell?
Are you crazy?

01:36:41.171 --> 01:36:42.881
- Back off
- Put the gun down

01:36:42.881 --> 01:36:45.133
- If you move, I swear I'll shoot
- Please, Ji-tae, stop!

01:36:45.634 --> 01:36:46.927
Get out of the way

01:36:47.260 --> 01:36:48.637
Put the gun down

01:36:49.179 --> 01:36:50.138
Step aside

01:36:50.138 --> 01:36:51.723
Please, stop

01:36:52.516 --> 01:36:54.893
- I'll talk to him
- I've had enough

01:36:55.268 --> 01:36:56.144
Get out of my way

01:36:56.144 --> 01:36:59.940
Son, drop the weapon and hack off

01:37:00.273 --> 01:37:01.525
Listen to me

01:37:01.566 --> 01:37:02.943
I'll count to three

01:37:03.902 --> 01:37:05.570
If you don't move,
I'll shoot you, too

01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:10.951
One,

01:37:11.284 --> 01:37:12.536
Cheol-su, wait

01:37:15.914 --> 01:37:17.207
Stop it

01:37:19.459 --> 01:37:20.168
two,

01:37:20.168 --> 01:37:21.211
Stop this

01:37:24.548 --> 01:37:25.298
- Stop!
- Three!

01:37:26.299 --> 01:37:27.467
Wait!

01:37:28.468 --> 01:37:31.596
Cheol-su, wait

01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:33.473
- Suni!
- Sis!

01:37:34.307 --> 01:37:35.809
Think you're better than me?

01:37:35.809 --> 01:37:36.685
Stop it!

01:37:36.685 --> 01:37:38.937
Think I'm a laughing stock?

01:37:38.937 --> 01:37:40.939
- Do something!
- Huh?

01:37:42.858 --> 01:37:44.192
Look at this mess

01:37:44.651 --> 01:37:46.069
What the...?

01:37:51.324 --> 01:37:54.953
After all that I did for you

01:37:55.203 --> 01:37:57.205
Do you know how much I liked you?

01:39:18.411 --> 01:39:23.667
Just calm down, boy

01:39:40.725 --> 01:39:43.895
Go after him and kill him

01:40:47.834 --> 01:40:49.127
Cheol-su

01:40:49.753 --> 01:40:51.671
Are you really a freak?

01:40:52.297 --> 01:40:54.382
Which is it?

01:40:56.384 --> 01:41:00.221
Which is the real you?

01:41:04.392 --> 01:41:05.894
I don't care

01:41:09.272 --> 01:41:18.031
I don't care if you're a freak

01:42:24.764 --> 01:42:26.891
Suni!

01:42:27.767 --> 01:42:29.269
It's a rock, you idiot

01:42:29.269 --> 01:42:31.146
Suni!

01:42:43.283 --> 01:42:45.243
You need to hide

01:42:45.785 --> 01:42:48.955
Hurry!
They're coming this way

01:42:50.331 --> 01:42:54.127
I'll tell them you ran away

01:42:54.502 --> 01:42:55.962
Don't follow me

01:42:57.505 --> 01:42:59.257
Go away, you idiot!

01:42:59.299 --> 01:43:02.302
If you come with me,
they'll kill you

01:43:05.805 --> 01:43:07.807
We can't he together now

01:43:16.649 --> 01:43:17.817
Go!

01:43:21.362 --> 01:43:22.447
Piss off!

01:43:22.906 --> 01:43:25.575
I hate you

01:43:28.536 --> 01:43:30.121
Get your dirty hands off me!

01:43:32.582 --> 01:43:34.959
Go, you damn fool!

01:43:38.046 --> 01:43:40.131
Oh, God...
I'm sorry, Cheol-su!

01:43:43.301 --> 01:43:44.677
I'm so sorry

01:43:46.471 --> 01:43:49.474
Don't follow me
I'm going

01:43:50.350 --> 01:43:52.852
Don't you follow me

01:44:05.865 --> 01:44:07.325
Don't go

01:44:21.714 --> 01:44:24.259
Go away! I'm going now

01:44:26.594 --> 01:44:28.096
Go away!

01:44:30.348 --> 01:44:31.641
I'm sorry...
Just don't follow me

01:44:50.535 --> 01:44:52.370
Over here, Colonel

01:44:52.370 --> 01:44:53.204
What is it?

01:44:53.204 --> 01:44:56.541
She came from that way
She's on her own

01:45:04.549 --> 01:45:08.678
Are you all right?
Where have you been all night?

01:45:08.761 --> 01:45:10.096
Where is he?

01:45:11.139 --> 01:45:12.140
I don't know

01:45:12.140 --> 01:45:13.558
What?

01:45:13.683 --> 01:45:15.935
Why are you harassing her?

01:45:15.935 --> 01:45:17.270
Are you lying to me?

01:45:17.562 --> 01:45:19.022
I don't know

01:45:19.939 --> 01:45:21.024
He ran away

01:45:21.024 --> 01:45:23.443
How can you not know?

01:45:23.443 --> 01:45:26.029
How dare you accuse
my daughter of lying?

01:45:26.029 --> 01:45:28.448
- How can you not know!
- Will you just stop?

01:45:28.448 --> 01:45:29.949
Calm down, everyone

01:45:29.949 --> 01:45:31.284
If anything goes wrong,
I swear to God...

01:45:31.284 --> 01:45:33.703
We should talk

01:45:37.290 --> 01:45:38.583
What now?

01:45:39.042 --> 01:45:42.795
If we expand the search
words will get out

01:45:43.504 --> 01:45:46.549
Wasn't it your plan to cover this up?

01:45:47.717 --> 01:45:50.595
Journalists will arrive soon

01:45:51.554 --> 01:45:56.142
We'd better get our story straight

01:45:58.186 --> 01:46:01.814
Unless you want things
to go a different way

01:46:05.693 --> 01:46:06.819
Return to base for now

01:46:14.118 --> 01:46:15.620
- Hurry
- Yes, sir

01:46:30.593 --> 01:46:33.096
This is not the end of it

01:46:34.180 --> 01:46:37.725
If he shows up,
contact me immediately

01:46:39.102 --> 01:46:40.353
All right?

01:46:42.605 --> 01:46:47.110
We'll he gone, too

01:46:57.537 --> 01:46:59.372
What shall I do with this?

01:47:02.542 --> 01:47:07.213
I meant to buy him some new clothes
hut I never got a chance

01:47:19.267 --> 01:47:21.394
Come on, Suni!

01:48:38.846 --> 01:48:39.972
Bye

01:48:40.348 --> 01:48:41.849
- Take care
- Bye!

01:48:43.851 --> 01:48:46.979
Dong-mi, come hack here

01:48:49.732 --> 01:48:54.362
When Donghwa Trading went under,

01:48:54.695 --> 01:48:57.448
the property was transferred
to your mother

01:48:57.532 --> 01:49:01.786
And she left it to you when she died

01:49:01.869 --> 01:49:04.872
A new resort is coming to the area

01:49:04.997 --> 01:49:06.666
You'd want to sell it,
I presume?

01:49:06.874 --> 01:49:09.919
It should do well
With clean air and all that

01:49:09.919 --> 01:49:11.921
Can we stay for the night?

01:49:13.297 --> 01:49:15.299
They must have rats here

01:49:15.883 --> 01:49:18.886
Why did you want to stay over?

01:49:20.263 --> 01:49:21.305
Don't know

01:49:21.389 --> 01:49:23.516
You always say that

01:49:24.183 --> 01:49:26.269
Gran, wanna see this?

01:49:27.186 --> 01:49:30.898
What a good-looking young man!

01:49:30.940 --> 01:49:32.358
He is, isn't he?

01:49:32.358 --> 01:49:36.487
Does he come from money?

01:49:36.904 --> 01:49:38.364
I don't think so

01:49:38.656 --> 01:49:42.326
Then, just have a little fun and
dump him

01:49:42.702 --> 01:49:45.913
But he's so good to me

01:49:47.582 --> 01:49:49.292
Be good to him

01:49:49.542 --> 01:49:52.044
Men love getting compliments

01:49:54.046 --> 01:49:57.550
When you grow up, you see things
that you didn't use to see

01:49:59.969 --> 01:50:02.430
Knowing more might seem good

01:50:04.765 --> 01:50:08.352
hut it turns you into a coward

01:50:10.980 --> 01:50:14.442
It only happens
once in your lifetime

01:50:15.943 --> 01:50:19.780
And it never comes hack

01:50:22.074 --> 01:50:23.534
Hello?

01:50:24.410 --> 01:50:26.078
We're deep in the countryside

01:50:29.081 --> 01:50:30.374
My gran?

01:50:31.584 --> 01:50:33.002
She is something else

01:50:42.553 --> 01:50:43.721
Yeah...

01:50:46.015 --> 01:50:50.478
Let me call you hack

01:50:53.397 --> 01:50:55.483
No, I'm fine
Good night

01:51:11.791 --> 01:51:13.042
What have you got there?

01:51:13.459 --> 01:51:17.046
It's a stun gun that dad got me

01:51:17.463 --> 01:51:19.298
Just in case

01:56:03.791 --> 01:56:09.588
Wait.
I'll come back

01:56:40.911 --> 01:56:45.124
You've been waiting for me?

01:57:50.939 --> 01:57:52.816
Chul-soo come here

01:57:54.985 --> 01:57:56.737
You can stop waiting now

01:58:24.223 --> 01:58:27.476
I'm so sorry, Chul-soo

01:58:30.270 --> 01:58:32.606
Why did you wait?

01:58:34.066 --> 01:58:35.734
I'm so sorry

01:58:38.403 --> 01:58:40.364
I did it all

01:58:41.490 --> 01:58:49.414
I did everything
I ever wanted to do

01:58:52.584 --> 01:58:55.420
All alone
Without you

01:58:57.965 --> 01:58:59.550
I am so sorry

01:59:14.565 --> 01:59:16.775
I've become an old woman now

01:59:18.610 --> 01:59:20.779
And my hair's gone all Grey

01:59:21.321 --> 01:59:22.739
No

01:59:27.619 --> 01:59:29.371
You haven't changed one hit

01:59:32.791 --> 01:59:34.293
Your hands,

01:59:36.420 --> 01:59:37.713
your mouth,

01:59:39.131 --> 01:59:40.632
your eyes

01:59:43.218 --> 01:59:45.137
you're still beautiful

01:59:51.143 --> 01:59:55.981
I really missed you

02:00:23.967 --> 02:00:29.431
Snow man was tempted
by what the dog told him

02:00:30.098 --> 02:00:37.522
and suddenly felt a heat in his heart

02:00:37.689 --> 02:00:39.233
That's really good

02:00:46.531 --> 02:00:49.701
Dark as a charcoal,

02:00:50.953 --> 02:00:54.665
his body is made of brass

02:00:55.874 --> 02:00:58.210
When you put woods in his mouth,

02:01:01.296 --> 02:01:07.261
it starts spitting fire

02:02:04.943 --> 02:02:06.695
We're going now?

02:02:07.571 --> 02:02:10.615
Why?
Did you forget something?

02:02:14.995 --> 02:02:16.288
Let's go

02:02:26.298 --> 02:02:30.886
Gran, I saw someone last night

02:02:31.094 --> 02:02:35.140
He was watching me on the phone

02:02:35.724 --> 02:02:37.601
You think you'd he scared

02:02:37.642 --> 02:02:41.730
hut for some reason,
I wasn't afraid

02:02:44.107 --> 02:02:44.858
Hello?

02:02:44.858 --> 02:02:47.944
Good morning, it's Kim
from the county office

02:02:48.111 --> 02:02:49.613
One moment

02:02:49.738 --> 02:02:52.532
It's the officer from yesterday

02:02:57.996 --> 02:02:59.164
I'm not selling it

02:02:59.164 --> 02:03:01.666
Pardon me? You're not?

02:03:03.752 --> 02:03:11.301
Thank you for holding my hands

02:03:11.968 --> 02:03:20.227
Thank you for gazing into my eyes

02:03:20.519 --> 02:03:28.777
Thank you, prince of my dreams,

02:03:29.111 --> 02:03:36.827
for coming to me like this

02:03:46.545 --> 02:03:53.093
All day long, I look upon the sky

02:03:55.095 --> 02:04:03.061
waiting for the moon to come up

02:04:03.645 --> 02:04:18.577
Because I can talk to him
when the night falls

02:04:20.871 --> 02:04:29.129
Don't forget our promises

02:04:29.421 --> 02:04:37.721
Don't forget our secrets

02:04:38.013 --> 02:04:46.271
Don't forget how your eyes

02:04:46.605 --> 02:04:54.696
made my heart pound
