WEBVTT

00:12.180 --> 00:13.238
JULIE: Do you know
why you're here?

00:13.280 --> 00:14.531
I was ordered to be here.

00:14.580 --> 00:16.377
JULIE: That's not
what I meant.

00:17.780 --> 00:19.509
Oh, yeah, well, look,
my new C.O. thinks

00:19.550 --> 00:21.177
that he's gonna
make admiral one day

00:21.220 --> 00:23.347
with his pioneering approach
to the management

00:23.390 --> 00:26.257
of combat stress.

00:26.290 --> 00:28.611
So you're not a fan
of psychotherapy?

00:28.660 --> 00:31.083
(chuckles)

00:31.130 --> 00:32.757
No.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.451
So...

00:35.500 --> 00:37.161
what should we talk about?

00:37.200 --> 00:38.224
I don't know.
It's your nickel.

00:38.270 --> 00:40.158
(sniffs)
Your time.

00:40.200 --> 00:42.634
All right.
Tell me about Nate.

00:44.510 --> 00:46.432
(heavy door opening)

00:49.210 --> 00:51.349
Jack... pot.

00:55.480 --> 00:58.745
You know...
(sighs)

00:58.790 --> 01:00.417
even if I wanted
to talk about that night--

01:00.460 --> 01:03.156
the op, and what happened--

01:03.190 --> 01:04.282
I don't think
you would be cleared.

01:04.330 --> 01:05.319
Mr. Hayes,

01:05.360 --> 01:07.499
I read the after action reports.

01:07.530 --> 01:09.293
I know about the
weapons on the ship

01:09.330 --> 01:10.524
and where they
were going.

01:10.570 --> 01:13.095
I'm cleared to know
anything you do.

01:29.150 --> 01:30.515
JASON: TOC, we
have conﬁrmed

01:30.550 --> 01:33.348
jackpot-- I'm looking at
14 Javelin missiles.

01:33.390 --> 01:35.358
Request permission
to move to demo.

01:35.390 --> 01:36.721
MAN (over radio):
Copy, Bravo 1. Wait one.

01:36.760 --> 01:38.580
Bravo 1 standing by.

01:38.630 --> 01:40.655
War on terror, baby.

01:40.700 --> 01:42.691
War on terror.

01:42.730 --> 01:45.597
TOC did give you
the authorization

01:45.630 --> 01:47.234
to move to demolition.

01:47.270 --> 01:49.830
You set the charges,

01:49.870 --> 01:52.509
but instead of proceeding
immediately to exﬁl...

01:52.540 --> 01:55.179
NATE:
Bravo 2, this is Bravo 4.

01:56.410 --> 01:58.401
Go for 2.
NATE: What's the story

01:58.450 --> 02:00.315
on those skiffs?

02:00.350 --> 02:01.442
Still out of our hair
for the moment.

02:01.480 --> 02:03.414
Beautiful.

02:03.450 --> 02:05.680
There's no reason we can't look
inside that safe on the bridge.

02:05.720 --> 02:07.654
Bridge safe is not our mission.

02:07.690 --> 02:10.386
We get into that safe,
maybe we find something

02:10.430 --> 02:12.921
lets us go after guys
on both ends of the shipment.

02:12.960 --> 02:15.520
Bravo 1, this is Bravo 2.
What's your status? Over.

02:15.560 --> 02:18.165
Bravo 2, hold one.

02:20.270 --> 02:22.704
Let's do this.

02:22.740 --> 02:24.503
Let's go.

02:24.540 --> 02:27.304
JASON: This is Bravo 1.
We're going for the ship's log.

02:27.340 --> 02:29.672
We're gonna find out where
these arms were headed.

02:29.710 --> 02:31.701
Sonny, you owe me that bottle
of Macharren's.

02:31.750 --> 02:33.809
Nate talked him into it?

02:33.850 --> 02:35.670
Why do I feel like
you just hustled me?

02:35.720 --> 02:37.278
'Cause I did.

02:37.320 --> 02:38.446
JULIE:
Nate really wanted

02:38.490 --> 02:40.412
to get a look
in that safe.

02:40.460 --> 02:43.429
It doesn't matter
what Nate wanted.

02:43.460 --> 02:45.428
I made the call.

02:45.460 --> 02:49.294
*

03:12.820 --> 03:14.412
Clear.
Clear.

03:14.460 --> 03:16.189
You guys get back to exfil.

03:18.490 --> 03:20.492
Alpha Team, moving to exfil.

03:26.030 --> 03:27.998
We got names, numbers.

03:28.040 --> 03:30.338
I mean, that's just the
stuff we can halfway read.

03:30.370 --> 03:32.338
(boats approaching)

03:32.380 --> 03:34.974
Bravo 1, this is Bravo 2.
You have

03:35.010 --> 03:36.409
three enemy boats inbound.

03:36.450 --> 03:38.270
You need to exfil immediately.

03:38.310 --> 03:39.470
Copy that. We're moving to the
secondary extraction point.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.646
Let's go.

04:03.770 --> 04:06.432
(tracers firing)

04:11.650 --> 04:13.515
Go! Go!

04:24.830 --> 04:26.957
You okay?
Yeah.

04:28.900 --> 04:30.492
NATE:
You all right?

04:31.470 --> 04:33.495
(grunting)

04:35.370 --> 04:36.928
NATE: We lost the bag.
JASON: Nate, leave it.

04:36.970 --> 04:37.629
I got it.

04:37.670 --> 04:39.433
Don't do it_.
Jace, I got It.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.902
Don't you do it, kid.
NATE: I got it.

04:40.940 --> 04:42.578
I got it!

04:42.610 --> 04:43.474
Let me get it.
Get in.

04:43.510 --> 04:44.477
NATE:
Walt!

04:46.380 --> 04:48.974
Get him in!

04:49.020 --> 04:50.339
Go, go, go, go!

04:55.920 --> 04:59.321
(automatic gunfire)

05:24.550 --> 05:25.710
Fire in the hole, boys!

05:38.030 --> 05:40.066
Where's that blood coming from?

05:55.450 --> 05:56.781
(sniffs)

06:00.090 --> 06:01.955
I understand that
you're Still In touch

06:01.990 --> 06:04.424
with his wife and child.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.153
He's my godson.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.498
And they're living
in Wyoming now?

06:11.530 --> 06:14.135
Mm-hmm.
That's where she's from.

06:14.170 --> 06:16.161
Molly.

06:16.200 --> 06:20.478
That'd be Nate's,
uh, wife, um...

06:20.510 --> 06:21.772
widow, so, yeah.

06:21.810 --> 06:23.573
And she's bringing
the boy back here

06:23.610 --> 06:26.579
this weekend
for his First Communion.

06:26.620 --> 06:27.678
Will your family be there?

06:27.720 --> 06:29.711
Well, look at that.
Time's up.

06:31.590 --> 06:34.479
So we're clear,
the fact that you refused

06:34.520 --> 06:37.580
to talk about Nate's death
is the most obvious way

06:37.630 --> 06:39.598
of telling me that
that's exactly what

06:39.630 --> 06:40.858
we need to be
talking about.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.993
It was really nice
meeting you, Julie.

06:43.030 --> 06:45.726
Uh, Dr. Kruger.
Right.

06:45.770 --> 06:47.499
I trust you agree that

06:47.540 --> 06:48.791
I fulfilled my obligation
here this morning,

06:48.840 --> 06:51.729
and you will relate that
to my chain of command.

06:51.770 --> 06:53.408
Okay.

06:54.910 --> 06:56.741
PRIEST:
The body of Christ.

06:57.910 --> 07:00.845
The body of Christ.

07:02.120 --> 07:03.610
The body of Christ.

07:03.650 --> 07:05.948
(church bells tolling)

07:05.990 --> 07:07.719
JASON: Aha! Look at that,
ladies and gentlemen,

07:07.760 --> 07:09.455
our First Communicant,
Landon Massey.

07:09.490 --> 07:10.479
Come here, buddy.

07:10.530 --> 07:12.589
Ah, bud!
Yeah.
Yes.

07:12.630 --> 07:13.927
Hey, blow it up.

07:13.960 --> 07:15.655
You know he's sleeping
on our fold-out, right?

07:15.700 --> 07:18.589
I heard.
(children shouting)

07:18.630 --> 07:20.939
I miss seeing you guys.

07:20.970 --> 07:22.961
It sucks that's
the way it works.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.739
And if any of us thought
there was even a chance

07:24.770 --> 07:25.998
you two weren't gonna
get past this,

07:26.040 --> 07:27.837
we'd all be taking it
pretty hard.

07:27.880 --> 07:28.699
DAVIS:
All right, buddy, look,

07:28.740 --> 07:29.741
you just enjoy it
while you can, okay?

07:29.780 --> 07:31.771
'Cause in a few years,
you want a sip of wine,

07:31.810 --> 07:32.970
you're gonna have to start
copping to Father

07:33.020 --> 07:34.248
about all your sins.

07:34.280 --> 07:35.770
Maybe not all of them.
(chuckles)

07:35.820 --> 07:37.640
We're gonna go.
I'm sorry,

07:37.690 --> 07:39.612
you can't spare a single
Saturday afternoon

07:39.660 --> 07:40.979
to celebrate your godbrother's
First Communion?

07:41.020 --> 07:42.726
We just watched him
eat the wafer.

07:42.760 --> 07:44.580
We really got to stay
till he drinks the Kool-Aid?

07:44.630 --> 07:46.029
ALANA: What you say
in private's one thing.

07:46.060 --> 07:48.824
In public, you
represent this family.

07:50.200 --> 07:51.690
Hey, Daddy.
Hi.

07:53.870 --> 07:55.963
We're gonna go.
Okay.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.662
JASON:
And they're off.

08:00.010 --> 08:01.534
RAY:
Well, you know, I'm...

08:01.580 --> 08:03.707
I'm just gonna go be

08:03.750 --> 08:05.672
somewhere else.
JASON:
Yeah.

08:09.820 --> 08:12.755
So, Molly and Landon are
gonna stay at the house

08:12.790 --> 08:15.008
for a couple nights after
her parents go back.

08:15.060 --> 08:16.721
Okay. Well, I don't
live there anymore,

08:16.760 --> 08:17.954
so it really
doesn't matter, right?

08:17.990 --> 08:21.198
But...
And I realize
it's a long shot,

08:21.230 --> 08:25.564
but it'd be great if you
could come by one evening.

08:25.600 --> 08:28.239
That's the first week
of new rotation.
Also,

08:28.270 --> 08:29.806
Emma's recital is this week,

08:29.840 --> 08:31.603
and I know she won't
say anything,

08:31.640 --> 08:34.973
_ but it would mean a lot
If you could just be there.

08:35.010 --> 08:37.547
I'll try.
I will try.
(multiple phones chiming)

08:40.120 --> 08:41.769
MAN:
We got to go.

08:41.820 --> 08:42.946
Okay, we got to go.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.787
Sorry, you'll have
to excuse us.

08:44.820 --> 08:45.912
Go.

08:48.290 --> 08:49.826
Let's move.
Go do this.

08:49.860 --> 08:51.259
Just be safe.

08:51.290 --> 08:54.293
Call when you can, okay?

08:54.330 --> 08:55.729
I will.

08:55.760 --> 08:58.263
MAN:
Come on.

09:03.640 --> 09:05.767
The Agency believes
we have an opportunity

09:05.810 --> 09:07.175
to snatch Abu Samir.

09:07.210 --> 09:08.302
Yes, I know, some of us

09:08.340 --> 09:09.978
have been down this road before.

09:10.010 --> 09:11.671
But for anyone needing
a refresher...

09:11.710 --> 09:14.816
Abu Samir Al Masri,

09:14.850 --> 09:16.841
high-level ISIL commander,

09:16.890 --> 09:18.881
responsible for dozens
of attacks

09:18.920 --> 09:20.979
on coalition
forces In Iraq.

09:21.020 --> 09:23.727
Last several months, we've
had sightings of Samir

09:23.760 --> 09:24.920
throughout Central Africa,
meeting with various

09:24.960 --> 09:26.791
local jihadi leaders.

09:26.830 --> 09:29.321
He's due to sit down with
some guys from Boko Haram

09:29.360 --> 09:31.920
in two days-- that's our window.

09:31.970 --> 09:33.995
We're going into Nigeria?

09:34.040 --> 09:35.632
Not Nigeria.

09:35.670 --> 09:36.864
Liberia.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.059
Samir doesn't trust
Boko enough

09:38.110 --> 09:39.737
to meet on their own turf.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.736
General Lionheart--

09:41.780 --> 09:43.600
he's guaranteeing security
for both sides

09:43.650 --> 09:45.106
at his compound
outside Monrovia.

09:45.150 --> 09:47.618
They've got 24-hour drone
surveillance on the place.

09:47.650 --> 09:50.380
They'll let us know as soon
as Samir's on-site.

09:50.420 --> 09:52.650
We're looking for
a straight-up snatch-and-grab.

09:52.690 --> 09:54.612
Live capture of
a high-value target.

09:54.660 --> 09:56.287
So you believe
a moment of truth comes,

09:56.320 --> 09:58.788
and Abu Samir just passes
on martyrdom?

09:58.830 --> 10:00.297
Martyrdom's a young man's game.

10:00.330 --> 10:02.059
Samir's_talent_ for
self-reInventIon

10:02.100 --> 10:03.658
is part of what's
allowed him to survive

10:03.700 --> 10:05.224
in the game
for over 20 years.

10:05.270 --> 10:07.966
But that means
20 years of gold

10:08.000 --> 10:09.365
floating around his head.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.867
And if you can
bring him to me

10:10.910 --> 10:13.378
still breathing,

10:13.410 --> 10:14.672
I'm gonna get it all.

10:32.290 --> 10:35.123
(gunshots, man groans)

10:37.970 --> 10:40.336
Clear!
Reset!

10:53.320 --> 10:56.244
(men grunting)

10:56.280 --> 10:58.919
(yelling in Arabic)
Yo mama.

10:58.950 --> 11:00.087
Get on the ground!
Whatever.

11:00.120 --> 11:01.417
Get on the ground!

11:01.460 --> 11:02.381
Get on the ground now!
Stop worrying about me.

11:02.420 --> 11:03.523
Stop worrying about me.
Now!

11:03.560 --> 11:05.858
You should worry about
your hostage 'cause you dead.

11:07.360 --> 11:08.224
BIG CHIEF:
Hold there!

11:12.070 --> 11:14.698
It appears we have
a problem, Mr. Spenser.

11:14.740 --> 11:16.469
Big problem, Big Chief.

11:16.500 --> 11:18.058
BIG CHIEF:
For you and me, both.

11:18.110 --> 11:19.361
Matter of fact,

11:19.410 --> 11:22.334
mine might be
the bigger problem.

11:22.380 --> 11:25.178
See, you get taken in
the prime of your life

11:25.210 --> 11:27.269
while you still
have your hair.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.117
I have to live the rest of
my life with these fellas

11:29.150 --> 11:30.378
whispering behind my back

11:30.420 --> 11:31.739
how I got you killed

11:31.790 --> 11:33.417
on account of I went easy.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.018
What do you think of that?

11:35.060 --> 11:37.449
I think the name Big Chief
is meant to be ironic.

11:38.460 --> 11:39.484
How's that now?

11:39.530 --> 11:42.124
Well, Big Chief in the movie,

11:42.160 --> 11:44.299
I mean,
the guy barely talks.

11:44.330 --> 11:45.968
You know, in fact,
it-it even kind of seems like

11:46.000 --> 11:47.968
maybe he can't talk.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.433
Whereas you...

11:49.470 --> 11:51.404
Please step out, miss.

11:51.440 --> 11:53.305
Thank you
for your service.

11:55.310 --> 11:56.800
Mr. Spenser, would you care
to save us a little time

11:56.850 --> 11:57.976
and tell us the mistakes

11:58.010 --> 12:00.046
you're already
planning to correct

12:00.080 --> 12:02.014
so as not to get yourself killed

12:02.050 --> 12:03.119
in some dumbass way?

12:03.150 --> 12:05.516
I can't think of one.

12:05.550 --> 12:08.018
Do you believe you were right
not to assess as a threat

12:08.060 --> 12:10.358
the woman we just saw
with a gun to your head?

12:10.390 --> 12:12.358
I believe I_was_
correct to prIorItIze

12:12.390 --> 12:14.824
the military-age male
as the greater threat.

12:14.860 --> 12:16.999
But I guess I should have
considered the possibility

12:17.030 --> 12:18.190
that she was muling 'em.

12:18.230 --> 12:19.834
You know, but, even then,

12:19.870 --> 12:21.235
I-I don't think

12:21.270 --> 12:23.363
that I would have
turned around to search her

12:23.410 --> 12:24.468
before I got him on the ground.

12:24.510 --> 12:26.432
And if I had,

12:26.470 --> 12:29.507
I bet you would've
dinged me for it.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.508
(clicks tongue)

12:32.850 --> 12:35.444
BIG CHIEF:
Reset!
(rope being pulled)

12:35.480 --> 12:37.311
(plane soaring)

12:37.350 --> 12:39.853
I'm telling you,
he's not ready.
So he's a wiseass.

12:39.890 --> 12:42.484
Wiseass? More like a smartass.
Okay.

12:42.520 --> 12:44.181
Do you remember what we were
like when we were in Green Team?

12:44.230 --> 12:46.528
Okay, I'm sorry, but
we just watched him get killed.

12:46.560 --> 12:49.154
What, did you see that?
You know as_w_ell as I know
that scenarIo IS a no-WIn.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.191
I don't know about that.
Big Chief says
the kid sees the Matrix,

12:51.230 --> 12:54.165
just like his old man.
What, is he gonna
write a book, too?

12:54.200 --> 12:56.395
*

12:59.540 --> 13:01.371
Mm-hmm.

13:01.410 --> 13:03.298
Anybody see a way to hit
this place from the ground?

13:03.350 --> 13:05.238
Well, not with Humvees or APCs,
that's for sure.

13:05.280 --> 13:07.009
Mm, a little Mogadishu
for my taste.

13:07.050 --> 13:08.278
We could patrol in.

13:08.320 --> 13:10.345
Insert somewhere
on this beach.

13:10.390 --> 13:11.414
RAY:
Mm-mm.

13:11.450 --> 13:14.248
What?
All that garbage floating

13:14.290 --> 13:15.382
on the surface gonna be
a problem for the outboards.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.559
Guys, stop, you're way
overthinking this, all right?

13:17.590 --> 13:19.421
We're not swimming
the prisoner out.

13:19.460 --> 13:20.950
Okay? We're going in the same
way we're going out,

13:21.000 --> 13:21.898
that's with choppers.

13:21.930 --> 13:23.420
RAY: Rotors are gonna
make an awful racket

13:23.470 --> 13:24.823
coming up the valley.

13:24.870 --> 13:25.962
Give everybody in the house

13:26.000 --> 13:27.433
time to get set
to repel boarders.

13:27.470 --> 13:28.835
It's not Samir's house.

13:28.870 --> 13:30.963
But it's not Samir's house.

13:31.010 --> 13:33.171
Uh-uh.
So?

13:33.210 --> 13:35.098
So why's he gonna dig in
when he hears the rotors?

13:35.140 --> 13:36.505
He's not gonna dig in
when he hears the rotors, okay?

13:36.540 --> 13:38.098
Spooks already said
he's not into martyrdom.

13:38.150 --> 13:39.344
So we're come straight up
the valley,

13:39.380 --> 13:40.938
we're gonna buzz the compound,

13:40.980 --> 13:42.277
we're gonna drop right down
on him, and then, what?

13:42.320 --> 13:43.514
Samir's gonna spurt.

13:43.550 --> 13:44.983
Instead of landing on the "X,"

13:45.020 --> 13:46.317
Black Hawks gonna come about
for the VI.

13:46.350 --> 13:47.988
Boom.
Bam.

13:48.020 --> 13:50.181
Davis, you got a basic sense
of what we'll need?

13:50.230 --> 13:52.380
For a helo-based
vehicle interdiction?

13:52.430 --> 13:53.454
Don't insult me.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.149
Oh, I wouldn't go
down that path

13:55.200 --> 13:56.451
if I were you.
(laughs)

13:56.500 --> 13:58.468
DAVIS: Hey, you heard
about your strap?

13:58.500 --> 14:00.866
Whoa, wait a second,
I don't have a strap, okay?

14:00.900 --> 14:03.607
Carlo's team's got the strap.
What, am I getting a DNA tech?

14:03.640 --> 14:05.938
No, she's still with Carlo.
You're getting the translator.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.403
Wait a second, they speak
English in Liberia.

14:07.440 --> 14:10.409
Yeah, but the general's guards
don't speak English.

14:10.450 --> 14:11.872
Because this weird bastard's
apparently so paran0Id

14:11.910 --> 14:13.309
about being betrayed,

14:13.350 --> 14:15.238
he only hires bodyguards
who can't communicate

14:15.280 --> 14:17.612
with the neighbors.
Okay, so what do they speak?

14:17.650 --> 14:20.210
Well, intelligence just said
"local tribal dialects,"
Ah.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.216
but turns out there's
about 200 of those.

14:22.260 --> 14:23.625
(chuckling):
Yeah, of course there is.
I looked that up.

14:23.660 --> 14:25.321
Good news is, Commander
Blackburn found a guy

14:25.360 --> 14:26.622
that grew up over there,

14:26.660 --> 14:28.389
so he speaks a whole
bunch of the big ones.

14:28.430 --> 14:30.318
Okay, wait a second, last time
that I was in the Tribals,

14:30.370 --> 14:32.588
it took two days to find a
translator who could speak Urdu.

14:32.630 --> 14:34.939
So you're telling me,
in 19 hours,

14:34.970 --> 14:37.438
you found someone who can speak
the local tribal dialects?

14:37.470 --> 14:39.404
Hey, it's better
to be lucky than good.

14:39.440 --> 14:41.032
(chuckling):
You got to be kidding me.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.552
Any word on wheels up?

14:56.590 --> 14:58.148
Strictly hush-hush.

14:59.160 --> 15:00.923
You know how it is,

15:00.960 --> 15:02.188
first spin of
a new rotation...

15:03.730 --> 15:05.368
What time did you pick
in the pool?

15:05.400 --> 15:06.526
2200.

15:07.570 --> 15:11.199
It gives us
about four hours.

15:11.240 --> 15:13.208
I have an idea
what we can do.

15:13.240 --> 15:15.003
Uh, n...

15:15.040 --> 15:17.201
No.
What? Doctor said
It was ﬁne.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.672
Good, even.

15:18.710 --> 15:21.679
A-- didn't he also say
that it could trigger labor?

15:21.720 --> 15:23.119
(scoffs)
Maybe.

15:23.150 --> 15:24.686
No, we need this kid
to wait in here

15:24.720 --> 15:27.086
till Daddy's home
to catch him.
(chuckles)

15:27.120 --> 15:28.348
You hear that, son?

15:28.390 --> 15:30.221
(laughs)

15:30.260 --> 15:32.558
Any idea when that'll be?

15:32.590 --> 15:35.957
(sighs) Time frame for
the op is awful tight.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.094
Just so as long as
you make it back home to us.

15:39.130 --> 15:41.598
Roger that.

15:41.640 --> 15:43.699
DAVIS:
So the ISUs are all loaded

15:43.740 --> 15:45.367
and I just got off
with the advance team.

15:45.410 --> 15:47.230
JASON: Great. TOC up and ready?
DAVIS: Oh, yeah.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.134
What do you say, Jedi, ready?
Let's go brother, huh?

15:49.180 --> 15:50.408
Come on, man.

15:50.450 --> 15:53.271
DAVIS:
Clay Spenser, Jason Hayes.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.709
Meet your strap.

15:55.750 --> 15:59.208
* I met myself there

15:59.250 --> 16:02.014
* Saying, "Go home."

16:10.230 --> 16:12.061
* Sing it loud and clear...

16:12.100 --> 16:14.330
We've had worse straps.

16:14.370 --> 16:16.588
Remember Captain
What's-his-name,

16:16.640 --> 16:19.006
froze on a HAHO ramp?

16:19.040 --> 16:21.474
At least this kid's a Team guy.

16:21.510 --> 16:22.772
JASON: Team guy?
That's Ash Spenser's kid.

16:22.810 --> 16:24.607
You realize that, right?

16:24.650 --> 16:26.049
We're gonna
hold it against him

16:26.080 --> 16:27.547
'cause his dad got PNG'd?

16:27.580 --> 16:29.514
His dad's only
persona non grata because

16:29.550 --> 16:31.484
he had the bad manners to write
a book without being an officer.

16:31.520 --> 16:33.488
(chuckles)

16:33.520 --> 16:35.488
Big Chief already signed off.
It's one mission.
JASON: One mission.

16:35.520 --> 16:37.329
I don't want to get it
in this kid's head

16:37.360 --> 16:38.554
like this is some kind of
an audition.

16:38.590 --> 16:39.625
One mission. Here.

16:39.660 --> 16:42.197
(chuckles)

16:43.770 --> 16:46.466
Hey, you got a problem
with your accommodations?

16:46.500 --> 16:48.639
You know how many times I've
made a hammock on a C-130?

16:48.670 --> 16:51.332
DAVIS: Yeah, the new CD. says,
"Straps get straps," so...

16:51.370 --> 16:53.474
But I'm not a strap.

16:53.510 --> 16:55.728
According to the Naw,

16:55.780 --> 16:58.544
until you graduate Green Team,
you're a member of Chalk 2,

16:58.580 --> 17:01.071
Alpha Platoon,
SEAL Team 3.

17:01.120 --> 17:03.588
Damn right.
Yes, and as impressive
as that is,

17:03.620 --> 17:04.814
if you're working
on an operation

17:04.850 --> 17:06.738
and you are not
a Tier-One Operator,

17:06.790 --> 17:08.485
you're a strap.

17:08.520 --> 17:10.488
So,

17:10.530 --> 17:12.179
how about you
sit back down,

17:12.230 --> 17:14.494
buckle up back here with the
rest of us support personnel,

17:14.530 --> 17:17.363
and don't make me kick your ass
up and down this aircraft?

17:20.870 --> 17:23.509
Can I at least get an Ambien?

17:23.540 --> 17:26.134
If I'm gonna sleep sitting
upright for the next 19 hours?

17:27.380 --> 17:30.508
It's gonna be 22 hours.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.541
And Ambien, I can do.

17:32.580 --> 17:34.468
I might even be able
to rustle you up a Seconal,

17:34.520 --> 17:35.646
you treat me real nice.

17:44.190 --> 17:45.384
Clay,

17:45.430 --> 17:47.227
straphanger, for now.

17:47.260 --> 17:48.522
MANDY:
Mandy,

17:48.560 --> 17:50.494
straphanger, always.

17:50.530 --> 17:53.397
You guys, uh, with the CIA?

17:53.440 --> 17:56.261
We can neither confirm nor deny.

18:01.610 --> 18:02.804
(tires screech)

18:11.820 --> 18:13.549
Hey.

18:13.590 --> 18:15.478
Just want to introduce
your new haIr mlSS||e,

18:15.520 --> 18:17.556
get his scent on you
while he's still calm.

18:17.590 --> 18:19.251
This is Cerberus.

18:19.290 --> 18:20.621
Yeah, he's a pussycat.

18:20.660 --> 18:21.524
Now, if he accidentally
bites you--

18:21.560 --> 18:23.562
well, in the unlikely
event that he does--

18:23.600 --> 18:25.261
do not say no.

18:25.300 --> 18:26.767
Part of their training is
that biting is never wrong.

18:26.800 --> 18:27.767
Ain't that right?

18:27.800 --> 18:29.438
Yeah. Hey, I should probably

18:29.470 --> 18:30.698
tell you where
we keep the broom handle

18:30.740 --> 18:32.298
in case we got to
pry open his jaw.

18:32.340 --> 18:33.773
Thank you, Sonny.
(chuckles)

18:33.810 --> 18:36.131
Hey, good boy.
Hey! Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. No.

18:36.180 --> 18:37.499
Listen, pal,

18:37.550 --> 18:39.575
you never tell him to sit.

18:39.610 --> 18:42.443
Only time he's supposed to sit
is when he smells explosives.

18:42.480 --> 18:43.708
We clear?

18:50.730 --> 18:51.754
MANDY:
Those aren't clouds.

18:51.790 --> 18:53.326
TIM:
Smoke.

18:53.360 --> 18:54.554
City's in the middle
of burning time.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.522
MANDY: There's no way
we get a green light

18:56.560 --> 18:57.925
unless we can confirm
SamIr's presence.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.369
Up till a few hours ago,
we were having no problem

18:59.400 --> 19:00.662
finding holes in the smog.

19:00.700 --> 19:01.894
"Finding holes"? I'm not seeing
any holes in here.

19:01.940 --> 19:03.532
TIM:
That's because now

19:03.570 --> 19:05.606
Lionheart's guys
have joined in the burning.

19:05.640 --> 19:07.335
Right. And you failed to mention
that to us because why?

19:07.380 --> 19:09.109
I told you, till a couple
of hours ago,

19:09.140 --> 19:13.270
our optics weren't compromised.
He means about the guys in
the compound starting to burn.

19:13.320 --> 19:16.539
You think they're using the
fires to cover Samir's arrival.

19:16.580 --> 19:18.639
I say we do a little
sneak and peak.

19:18.690 --> 19:20.282
A ground recon?

19:20.320 --> 19:22.208
You want to go out
into the city on foot?

19:22.260 --> 19:23.921
Yeah, we'll take the
Scooby Van. Davis?

19:23.960 --> 19:25.689
TIM: Seriously, guys,
I know Monrovia's

19:25.730 --> 19:27.595
supposed to have gotten better
the last couple of years,

19:27.630 --> 19:28.824
but it's still kind of
Mad Max out there.

19:28.860 --> 19:30.259
JASON:
Wow, now, that was racist.

19:30.300 --> 19:32.291
That sounded racist to me?
How about you?

19:32.330 --> 19:33.831
Mad Max is wall-to-wall
white folks.

19:33.870 --> 19:35.394
Definitely racist
to ask the black guy

19:35.440 --> 19:36.668
to rule if something's
racist or not.

19:36.700 --> 19:38.406
Just FYI.
Okay, mocha latte.
Guys.

19:38.440 --> 19:40.271
Guys! You're punking us, right?
RAY:
See? Now that's racist.

19:40.310 --> 19:42.369
You're not actually considering
going out there?

19:42.410 --> 19:44.799
(foreign music playing,
indistinct conversations)

20:13.810 --> 20:16.438
(music playing over speakers)

20:23.320 --> 20:24.639
(man in distance laughs)

20:27.760 --> 20:29.648
JASON:
Set up the camera.

20:29.690 --> 20:31.578
I'll get first watch.

20:31.630 --> 20:33.257
You guys get some sleep.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.689
(street noises, bell ringing)

20:45.870 --> 20:48.998
(foreign music playing
in distance)

21:16.070 --> 21:17.708
Morning khat delivery?

21:17.740 --> 21:19.469
Possible.

21:19.510 --> 21:22.877
Most of Lionheart's guys
are a bunch of speed freaks.

21:22.910 --> 21:23.774
(Clay chuckles)

21:23.810 --> 21:25.971
Shocking.

21:38.630 --> 21:42.020
Look, my, uh... my dad's book.

21:42.060 --> 21:45.029
I know a lot of guys
had a problem with it.

21:45.070 --> 21:47.493
Man survives the things he did,

21:47.540 --> 21:49.758
he should write
a book about them.

21:52.770 --> 21:53.873
Come on. Your watch.
Get in here.

21:53.910 --> 21:54.899
Let's go. Hey.

21:54.940 --> 21:56.498
Come on. Move over, will you?

21:56.540 --> 21:57.768
You're crowding my space now.

21:57.810 --> 21:59.607
(grunts)

22:02.880 --> 22:05.041
Stay right there, strap,
so I can lean back into you.

22:05.090 --> 22:07.388
Just like that. There you go.

22:07.420 --> 22:09.411
(sniffles)

22:14.700 --> 22:16.895
We got movement.

22:19.730 --> 22:22.528
White kuﬁ.
Take a look.

22:22.570 --> 22:23.969
TOC, this is Bravo 1.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.898
Confirming you're seeing
what we're seeing here.

22:25.940 --> 22:27.874
Roger that, Bravo 1,
we're seeing it.

22:27.910 --> 22:30.378
Positive ID.
on Abu Samir Al Masri.

22:30.410 --> 22:31.877
Congratulations, TOC.

22:31.910 --> 22:34.708
He is exactly where you told us
he was gonna be.

22:34.750 --> 22:36.741
I'll tell you what, we're gonna
pack up, and then we're gonna

22:36.780 --> 22:37.986
exfil. How copy?

22:38.020 --> 22:39.817
Strong copy, Bravo 1.

22:39.850 --> 22:42.956
Great work.

22:42.990 --> 22:44.719
(laughs softly)

22:46.460 --> 22:47.927
JASON:
Let's go.
I don't get it.

22:47.960 --> 22:50.895
What do you mean
you don't get it?

22:50.930 --> 22:53.569
I mean, Samir's legendary
for his tradecraft.

22:53.600 --> 22:55.033
Kept him alive all these years,
while his friends

22:55.070 --> 22:56.697
were getting turned
into pink mist.

22:56.740 --> 22:59.004
Why is he coming out
in the open now?

22:59.040 --> 23:02.806
We don't know that it's khat
they're selling.

23:11.220 --> 23:13.609
MANDY:
Bravo 1, this is TOC.

23:13.660 --> 23:15.810
Current video feed
appears to show subjects

23:15.860 --> 23:17.987
unloading a hooded prisoner.

23:18.030 --> 23:19.952
Can you confirm?

23:19.990 --> 23:22.527
JASON:
Affirmative.

23:22.560 --> 23:24.164
Freeze it there.

23:25.930 --> 23:27.568
Enhance.

23:33.140 --> 23:35.131
Oh, God.

23:35.180 --> 23:37.842
I know who that is.

23:44.520 --> 23:46.681
BRYCE: Believe everyone's
properly situated here now,

23:46.720 --> 23:48.711
Ms. Ellis, so please
tell us what we know

23:48.760 --> 23:50.648
about this poor woman,
Ms., uh...

23:50.690 --> 23:51.827
Marshall, sir.

23:51.860 --> 23:54.499
Stacey Marshall.
Abducted April last year

23:54.530 --> 23:56.794
from her NGO's distribution
center in South Sudan.

23:56.830 --> 23:59.128
We're not certain how _she
came Into the posseSSIon

23:59.170 --> 24:01.593
of this particular group, but
as you know, it's not uncommon

24:01.640 --> 24:02.891
for hostages
to be sold and resold

24:02.940 --> 24:04.134
through various pipelines,

24:04.170 --> 24:06.138
particularly attractive
Western females.

24:06.170 --> 24:07.808
Hmm. Thank you, Ms. Ellis.

24:07.840 --> 24:09.603
Now, Eric,

24:09.640 --> 24:11.608
how are we planning to bring
this young lady home

24:11.650 --> 24:13.641
to her loving parents?
Sir?

24:13.680 --> 24:15.773
Yes, Ms. Ellis?
Abu Samir's continued survival

24:15.820 --> 24:18.084
would almost certainly mean
hundreds of deaths,

24:18.120 --> 24:20.611
both of_ civilians
and of coaIItIon personnel,

24:20.660 --> 24:22.582
and in fact, we believe
he may have knowledge

24:22.620 --> 24:23.882
of planned attacks
already in motion.

24:23.930 --> 24:25.921
I'm gonna cut you off
there, Ms. Ellis.

24:25.960 --> 24:27.120
It sounded like
you're about to suggest

24:27.160 --> 24:28.650
we do nothing for Ms. Marshall,

24:28.700 --> 24:30.895
and instead adhere
to our current operatIonal plan

24:30.930 --> 24:32.795
to snatch Abu Samir.

24:32.830 --> 24:35.958
Eric, I'm gonna ask you
a very simple question.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.707
Do we have the resources
to rescue the hostage

24:38.740 --> 24:43.074
and perform a successful
nonlethal snatch of the HVT?

24:43.110 --> 24:45.578
ERIC: Well, sir, it's difficult
to be definitive,

24:45.610 --> 24:47.942
till we've had enough time
to fully revise our ops plan,

24:47.980 --> 24:49.641
but I think at the moment...

24:49.680 --> 24:51.011
We can do both.

24:51.050 --> 24:52.540
I-I'm sorry.

24:52.590 --> 24:54.615
Who is that?
Senior Chief Hayes.

24:54.660 --> 24:55.684
Jason.

24:55.720 --> 24:57.551
Uh, you were saying?

24:57.590 --> 25:00.058
I'm saying that we can
accomplish both objectives.

25:00.090 --> 25:02.752
Now, son, needless to say,
your reputation precedes you.

25:02.800 --> 25:04.222
But that's mighty hard
to imagine.

25:04.270 --> 25:06.830
Assuming that Samir digs in.

25:06.870 --> 25:10.567
But according to the CIA, he's
gonna pick flight over fight.

25:10.610 --> 25:12.703
Isn't that right, Ms. Ellis?

25:12.740 --> 25:15.777
Uh, that's correct.
That's our projection.

25:15.810 --> 25:16.902
JASON: So, Helo 1
and Helo 2

25:16.940 --> 25:18.669
are gonna fast-rope
the assault team

25:18.710 --> 25:20.177
on top of the building.

25:20.210 --> 25:22.212
They're gonna clear down
and secure the hostage.

25:22.250 --> 25:24.616
Helo 3 is gonna go
after Samir when he squirts.

25:24.650 --> 25:27.778
And Helo 4 is gonna maintain
our close air support.

25:27.820 --> 25:30.084
Eric. Clearly your op-planning
was much further along

25:30.120 --> 25:31.587
than you led us to believe.

25:31.630 --> 25:33.552
Nice work, son.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.625
Thank you, sir.

25:35.660 --> 25:36.752
You'll launch this evening?

25:36.800 --> 25:38.119
Soon as the sun goes down.

25:38.170 --> 25:40.024
Good. Good luck.

25:40.070 --> 25:41.264
Thank you, gentlemen.

26:04.890 --> 26:08.291
We miss out on this guy,
right, we miss out on Samir,

26:08.330 --> 26:11.720
who knows how many more people
he's gonna kill? I-I get that.

26:11.770 --> 26:14.295
This may be our only shot,
I understand.

26:14.340 --> 26:16.661
I almost had him in
Baghdad two years ago.

26:16.700 --> 26:19.760
I was meeting with this
deputy economic minister,

26:19.810 --> 26:21.835
coffee shop
in the Mansour district.

26:21.880 --> 26:23.233
We're getting
ready to go.

26:23.280 --> 26:26.306
Door opens.

26:26.350 --> 26:28.045
It's Samir.

26:28.080 --> 26:29.718
Walks right by our table,

26:29.750 --> 26:31.718
not much farther than
where you are rIght now.

26:31.750 --> 26:35.015
I'm close enough to see the
crystal's cracked on his Rolex.

26:35.060 --> 26:36.209
That's close.

26:36.260 --> 26:37.750
Then I look
at my source.

26:37.790 --> 26:39.257
Take out Samir,
even if I get away,

26:39.290 --> 26:40.757
my asset's a dead man.

26:40.800 --> 26:43.223
Probably tortured
for a month first, right?

26:43.260 --> 26:44.329
So, as soon as
we're on the street,

26:44.370 --> 26:46.099
I call it in,
but turns out,

26:46.130 --> 26:48.860
our intrepid local partners
at the state security services

26:48.900 --> 26:52.063
had been infiltrated
by extremists.

26:52.110 --> 26:54.078
Hey. There's nothing
you could've done.

26:54.110 --> 26:56.772
Nothing.
Well, a week later,

26:56.810 --> 26:58.949
one of Samir's cells blows up
a school bus in Mosul,

26:58.980 --> 27:01.175
kills 26 teenagers.
Week after that,

27:01.220 --> 27:03.688
my source, the guy
I was protecting?

27:03.720 --> 27:07.713
Samir's guys grab him
and his family.

27:07.760 --> 27:11.719
Send the death videos
to Langley.

27:11.760 --> 27:13.853
We got this.

27:13.900 --> 27:15.856
The hostage?

27:15.900 --> 27:17.697
Like I said.

27:17.730 --> 27:19.721
We got this.

27:48.730 --> 27:50.891
*

28:14.790 --> 28:16.758
CHALK 4 PILOT:
This is Chalk 4.

28:16.790 --> 28:19.384
I'm having some kind of trouble
with my pedals.

28:19.430 --> 28:20.727
I'm getting
a lot of shake in 'em.

28:22.860 --> 28:24.066
It's affecting our stability.

28:24.100 --> 28:26.091
I'm trying to hold it steady.

28:28.370 --> 28:31.806
All right, Chalk 4,
I need your honest assessment.

28:31.840 --> 28:34.104
Can you continue this mission?

28:34.140 --> 28:36.335
Negaﬁve.
I need to put her down.

28:38.510 --> 28:40.774
Copy, Chalk 4.
Chalks 1, 2 and 3,

28:40.820 --> 28:42.412
your birds are
still functional, correct?

28:42.450 --> 28:44.179
Roger. Five-by-five.

28:44.220 --> 28:45.847
CHALK 2 PILOT:
Chalk 2, five-by-five.

28:45.890 --> 28:47.187
CHALK 3 PILOT:
Chalk 3, five-by-five.

28:47.220 --> 28:50.280
All right, all call signs,
initiate bump plan.

28:50.320 --> 28:52.857
Mission is now exclusively
hostage rescue.

28:52.890 --> 28:56.724
Snatch and grab operation
has been scrapped.

28:58.030 --> 28:59.327
Sorry, ma'am.

28:59.370 --> 29:04.262
We'll have to get him next time.

29:04.310 --> 29:07.234
CHALK 1 PILOT:
Confirming. Hostage rescue only.

Clear.

(Stacey screaming)

31:26.150 --> 31:28.209
Put it down now!

31:28.250 --> 31:30.138
Put it down!

31:30.180 --> 31:31.283
Translator.

31:31.320 --> 31:33.914
(speaking in Hausa)

31:33.960 --> 31:35.154
RAY: I'm gonna
ghost him.

31:35.190 --> 31:36.987
Try another dialect.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.089
(Clay speaking in Yoruba)

It's okay. It's okay.

31:46.200 --> 31:48.293
Look, hey, it's all right.

31:48.340 --> 31:50.467
It's okay. We're here.
We're American.

31:50.500 --> 31:52.263
We're gonna take
you home, okay?

31:52.310 --> 31:54.073
Shh. You're safe.
All right?
(whimpering)

31:54.110 --> 31:55.236
I'll get this off of you.
Thank you.

31:55.280 --> 31:56.577
We're gonna take you
home, all right?

31:56.610 --> 31:58.009
It's okay. Hey.

31:58.050 --> 31:59.642
All Chalks, this is Bravo.

31:59.680 --> 32:01.568
Move to secure the hostage.
We're gonna move her to exfil

32:01.620 --> 32:03.042
from here.

32:03.080 --> 32:05.014
CHALK 1 PILOT:
Roger, Bravo 1.

32:05.050 --> 32:06.415
Nice work.

32:06.450 --> 32:08.054
This is X-Ray 1.
We're on the first deck.

32:08.090 --> 32:09.057
Looks like your dog's
found something. Over.

32:09.090 --> 32:10.159
Sonny! Sonny!

32:10.190 --> 32:12.021
You and the strap,
you exfil her.

32:12.060 --> 32:13.948
We're gonna go see
what the dog has,

32:14.000 --> 32:15.558
then we're gonna go home
on Chalk 2. Let's go.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.488
Boss, we run into another one
of the general's guys,

32:17.530 --> 32:19.589
it'd be great to have
a translator with us.

32:19.630 --> 32:21.234
You want the strap on my back,
don't you? Okay, let's go.

32:21.270 --> 32:22.396
Let's go.

We still have a chance
to grab SamIr.

We good?

33:12.820 --> 33:16.187
You can run but you can't hide.

You're gonna stay here
and watch our six.

33:34.480 --> 33:36.505
Are we clear?

33:36.540 --> 33:38.679
Yeah. All right. Clear.

33:38.710 --> 33:40.769
Go.

Easy. (speaks Arabic)

Real slow, hey.

36:26.850 --> 36:27.976
Raise your hands.

36:28.010 --> 36:29.477
Put them up.

Look at me, look at me,
look. Right there.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.250
Raise your hands.

36:36.290 --> 36:38.349
Raise your hands.

37:02.020 --> 37:04.648
(grunts)

37:31.040 --> 37:33.770
Listen to me, I told you
to stay out of the tunnel, no?!

37:33.810 --> 37:36.973
Jace!Jace!

37:38.550 --> 37:40.518
Walk me through it, okay?

37:40.550 --> 37:41.687
When I left you
at the tunnel's entrance,

37:41.720 --> 37:43.517
I told you
to watch our six.

37:43.560 --> 37:44.822
Ready? Go.
Then, how, why?

37:44.860 --> 37:46.680
I caught a dude trying
to creep on you guys,

37:46.730 --> 37:48.652
so I figured I needed to clear
the rest of that tunnel section

37:48.700 --> 37:49.997
in case he had a partner.
Oh, but really? Okay.

37:50.030 --> 37:51.725
Then, why did you decide
to shwack some HVT

37:51.770 --> 37:54.694
when we were sent 5,000 miles
to bring him in alive?

37:54.740 --> 37:56.367
I came on the room,
I saw the "S"-vest,

37:56.400 --> 37:58.402
I assessed that all three of
us were in imminent threat.

37:58.440 --> 37:59.839
Did you assess why
we weren't shooting?

37:59.870 --> 38:01.030
I figured you didn't
have a clean shot.

38:01.070 --> 38:02.901
Did you check his hands?

38:02.940 --> 38:05.477
No, I-I-I didn't want to give
him time to clack off the vest.

38:08.480 --> 38:10.573
What? Come on. I mean, the guy
was wearing an "S"-vest.

38:10.620 --> 38:11.882
That-That's got to
be clean, right?

38:15.860 --> 38:17.418
JASON: Itold him,
"Stay outside, watch my six."

38:17.460 --> 38:18.620
RAY:
Yeah, I know,

38:18.660 --> 38:19.752
but the kid made a call.
No, what...

38:19.790 --> 38:21.451
what kind of
call did he make?

38:21.500 --> 38:22.694
And you know what,
he's got a point.
A point?

38:22.730 --> 38:23.549
That guy trying to creep

38:23.600 --> 38:25.625
could've just as easily
had a friend.

38:25.670 --> 38:26.762
Plus, he got Samir straight
through the light switch.

38:26.800 --> 38:27.721
JASON:
Right.
I mean, come on.

38:27.770 --> 38:29.692
You know what, Samir is
all about martyrdom.

38:29.740 --> 38:30.968
I tell you what,
that detonator, bam,

38:31.000 --> 38:32.831
right when we
enter the room.

38:32.870 --> 38:34.974
Boom. _
Maybe he was tryIng
to draw us closer.

38:35.010 --> 38:38.400
You know what? His thumb wasn't
on the detonator, okay?

38:38.450 --> 38:39.599
How was it
with the hostage?

38:39.650 --> 38:41.072
Got her number.
Got her number.

38:41.110 --> 38:42.509
RAY: Hold on, you're saying
that's why you didn't smoke him?

38:42.550 --> 38:43.744
That's something.
Wait a second.

38:43.780 --> 38:44.747
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
slow down. Stop.

38:44.790 --> 38:45.916
You're saying that's why
you didn't smoke him?

38:45.950 --> 38:47.611
No. No, man.

38:47.650 --> 38:48.981
The kid was right
as far as my position.

38:49.020 --> 38:50.715
I didn't have a clear shot.
I did, I did.

38:50.760 --> 38:53.354
I had the shot.
I could've brought him in.

38:53.390 --> 38:54.948
Bottom line,
kid saw a guy in an "S"-vest,

38:55.000 --> 38:57.855
saw he had the drop on him,
took the shot.

38:57.900 --> 38:59.891
White noise right now in my
head. I am not hearing you.

38:59.930 --> 39:01.739
You're gonna call him out
in the AAR, say he got it wrong?

39:03.870 --> 39:05.565
'Cause you know that's gonna
follow him, Jason.

39:05.610 --> 39:07.737
Your name in an AAR,
saying it was a bad shoot?

39:07.770 --> 39:09.499
(exhales)

39:09.540 --> 39:11.508
Look, you might actually be

39:11.550 --> 39:13.745
the best damn gunfighter
who ever lived.

39:13.780 --> 39:15.668
If not, you're awful close.
All right, I'm listening now.
What was that?

39:15.720 --> 39:17.915
So, if you tell me that even
back when you were in Green Team

39:17.950 --> 39:19.440
you were good enough
to give a guy in an "S"-vest

39:19.490 --> 39:20.741
the pregnant pause
before smoking him

39:20.790 --> 39:21.916
because of where
his damn thumb was?

39:21.960 --> 39:23.689
Samir's thumb wasn't
on the detonator.

39:23.720 --> 39:25.051
Thumb was not on
the detonator.

39:25.090 --> 39:26.352
Did you see his thumb?
I couldn't see his hands.

39:26.390 --> 39:28.551
I could see his hands.
You feel honor bound
to call the kid out

39:28.600 --> 39:29.726
because he missed
somethIng that you

39:29.760 --> 39:30.897
and a half dozen
other guys on Earth

39:30.930 --> 39:32.067
are good enough not to miss?

39:33.870 --> 39:35.929
Just make sure you're not doing
it 'cause of who his father is.

39:35.970 --> 39:37.790
All right, okay.

39:37.840 --> 39:39.637
Or who he reminds you of.

39:39.670 --> 39:42.036
Nate's death isn't on you.

39:43.880 --> 39:46.007
ERIC:
Hell of an op, gents.

39:46.050 --> 39:48.473
Outstanding.

39:48.520 --> 39:50.010
Thank you very much, sir.

39:50.050 --> 39:52.644
Listen, obviously,
most of the AAR

39:52.690 --> 39:53.918
is gonna be
about the chopper problems.

39:53.950 --> 39:55.918
Comms we obviously
know about.

39:55.960 --> 39:57.916
Intel turned out
to be solid.

39:57.960 --> 40:00.087
Eight enemy K.I.A.s,
including one

40:00.130 --> 40:03.657
HVT wearing an "S"-vest.

40:03.700 --> 40:05.861
All clean, correct?

40:08.970 --> 40:11.768
Rogen

40:11.810 --> 40:14.062
Eight clean kills, sir.

40:17.080 --> 40:18.809
It's good work.

40:42.540 --> 40:45.668
Look, we should've
brought him in for you.

40:47.940 --> 40:50.977
I told you he'd choose surrender
over martyrdom.

40:51.010 --> 40:52.568
Almost got everyone killed.

41:00.250 --> 41:02.912
You just saved a woman

41:02.960 --> 41:04.848
from probably being tortured
to death on the Internet

41:04.890 --> 41:06.949
in front of chat room trolls

41:06.990 --> 41:11.825
and budding, sexual sadists
and her friends and loved ones.

41:11.870 --> 41:15.795
You also, by the way,
found time to rid the world

41:15.840 --> 41:19.003
of one of its few dozen
or so most eVIl people.

41:21.580 --> 41:23.878
Call that a good
night's work.

41:27.610 --> 41:30.078
