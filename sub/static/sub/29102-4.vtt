01:25.877 --> 01:30.507
Welcome to the PolyCon
ICE Detention Center kitchen, ladies.

01:30.590 --> 01:33.510
You got 75 detainees out there
waiting for grub.

01:34.177 --> 01:36.012
Most of them don't speak English,

01:36.096 --> 01:39.015
but they all speak Hungarian,
so chop-chop.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.308
Who's in charge?

01:42.352 --> 01:43.937
Uh, I'll get us started.

01:45.730 --> 01:47.857
-You were--
-Yes, I was.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.443
Right here on this hallowed ground
with you, Reznikov.

01:50.527 --> 01:51.486
Couldn't stay away.

01:53.571 --> 01:56.032
Hey, you wanna chop?

01:57.659 --> 02:01.204
Uh, I'll help.
Looks like a two

02:01.287 --> 02:02.789
All right, let's see.

02:03.206 --> 02:08.545
Uh, we have, uh,
expired vegetables in a can,

02:08.628 --> 02:13.424
uh, expired meat substitute.

02:13.508 --> 02:14.509
Uh...

02:15.093 --> 02:18.429
onions that are sprouted and mealy garlic.

02:18.513 --> 02:20.932
All right, look,
at least the rice looks good.

02:21.015 --> 02:25.061
Lorna, peel the garlic.
Cut all the bad parts out.

02:25.854 --> 02:28.523
Flaca, start boiling the water
for the rice.

02:29.649 --> 02:30.900
I know they're bad kids,

02:30.984 --> 02:33.820
but don't they need
more food than this to grow?

02:33.903 --> 02:37.907
This isn't juvie, sweetheart.
It's a different kind of detention.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.450
Yeah, immigrant detention.

02:40.034 --> 02:42.370
Hey, do you wanna live in the USA?

02:42.453 --> 02:46.958
Are you white? Preferably Western European
or Australian white?

02:47.041 --> 02:48.877
No? Wait here.

02:48.960 --> 02:51.754
Have some old, fake meat
prepared by felons.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.464
Welcome to America.

02:53.548 --> 02:57.886
Well, it's better than Ellis Island,
where they just let everybody in.

02:57.969 --> 03:00.263
-I mean, now look.
-Yeah, now look.

03:00.346 --> 03:05.268
You're here 'cause your family
came in through Ellis Island.

03:05.351 --> 03:07.854
Back when the thought of America
becoming a fascist regime

03:07.937 --> 03:12.901
with one party ruling behind
a radical authoritarian was unthinkable.

03:13.484 --> 03:16.404
Huh! How times have changed.

03:17.906 --> 03:20.575
Did you have to go
through a detention center

03:20.658 --> 03:23.036
when you came from Puerto Rico?

03:23.703 --> 03:25.997
I'm an American citizen.
Puerto Rico is part of America.

03:26.080 --> 03:27.123
Oh!

03:27.207 --> 03:31.502
It's a poverty-bound outpost
with Latin food and limited job prospects,

03:31.586 --> 03:32.962
but still part of the US.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.589
Sounds a lot like the Bronx.

03:35.173 --> 03:38.009
All right, how's it going over here?

03:38.092 --> 03:41.679
We're taking a very thorough approach.

03:41.763 --> 03:43.223
Okay, here, here, here.

03:43.306 --> 03:46.184
All right. Top, okay?

03:46.267 --> 03:49.103
Bottom, half, peel.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.023
Okay? And then chop.

03:52.106 --> 03:55.068
Keeping the tip of the knife down.
Try not to cry.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.952
Gloria, don't hover, huh?

04:04.369 --> 04:07.789
And go put those cut potatoes in water
so they don't turn brown.

04:08.581 --> 04:10.708
Okay, sounds like a good idea.

04:11.501 --> 04:12.710
Nicky, finish this.

04:13.253 --> 04:17.048
Keep the pieces small. No lazy chunks.

04:18.716 --> 04:19.592
You...

04:21.135 --> 04:22.470
start sautéing the onions.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.722
Lorna, bring me the garlic.

04:51.374 --> 04:52.417
Holy shit.

05:00.341 --> 05:02.176
They look haunted and shit.

05:04.220 --> 05:06.639
Like a room full of people
who just saw <i>The Ring.</i>

05:07.181 --> 05:09.851
Is it wrong that I was secretly hoping
they were men?

05:13.062 --> 05:15.231
Is it wrong that I wasn't?

05:15.315 --> 05:18.151
Okay, everyone, you can line up.
The food is ready.

05:22.780 --> 05:24.115
Enjoy your meal.

05:25.241 --> 05:26.242
Hello.

05:29.662 --> 05:30.621
Enjoy your meal.

05:32.832 --> 05:33.958
Here you go.

05:38.129 --> 05:42.300
Okay, you gotta--
You gotta keep it moving, please. Come on.

05:44.344 --> 05:47.305
Oh, my... What are you doing here?

05:47.388 --> 05:48.639
Blanca, what are you doing here?

05:48.723 --> 05:50.933
I thought you were getting out.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.061
I did, too.

05:54.354 --> 05:58.733
They took me all over the place,
and it was a setup, from the riot charges.

05:58.816 --> 05:59.942
Hurry up! I'm hungry!

06:00.068 --> 06:01.819
Shut up, I'm having a reunion here.

06:01.903 --> 06:04.447
Okay.
Hold on, hold on. I don't understand.

06:04.822 --> 06:07.408
I'll explain later. But...

06:07.492 --> 06:09.035
I need you to find Diablo.

06:09.118 --> 06:10.244
Oh, my God!

06:10.328 --> 06:13.831
-Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

06:13.915 --> 06:17.502
Hey! Excuse me, do not touch the inmate.
Immigrant. Do not touch the immigrant.

06:17.585 --> 06:19.545
Why don't you take it over there?
We got this.

06:20.588 --> 06:24.217
Oh, my God, girl, am I tripping?
I thought I'd never see you again.

06:24.300 --> 06:27.637
-Girl, you look hot.
-Well, duh. I'm still me.

06:27.929 --> 06:29.764
No, I mean sweaty.

06:29.847 --> 06:30.973
Oh!

06:31.057 --> 06:33.935
It's like a fucking dank-ass locker room
in here. It's the worst.

06:34.018 --> 06:36.646
Flaca, you have no idea.
You have to help me get out.

06:37.188 --> 06:38.731
What do you mean

06:38.815 --> 06:41.943
No, no, it's a mistake that I'm here.
I need you to find my mom.

06:42.026 --> 06:44.654
Tell her I know she's mad at me,
but that this is an emergency, okay?

06:44.737 --> 06:45.822
Maria Ramos in Miami.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.490
Okay. Don't worry, okay?

06:47.573 --> 06:49.492
Worry face gives you elevens
between your brows.

06:49.575 --> 06:51.619
-Okay. Okay.
-I got you.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.127
Ah, good afternoon, CO Hopper.

06:59.210 --> 07:02.338
You are you a sight
for sore eyes, Mr. Caputo.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.589
Please, call me Joe.

07:04.382 --> 07:06.551
Yeah, man.

07:06.634 --> 07:08.928
I knew that baby warden wouldn't last.

07:09.011 --> 07:11.055
I'm impressed they got you here
so quickly, though.

07:11.139 --> 07:14.142
You heard she closed down the SHU?
Fucking amateur hour.

07:14.225 --> 07:17.061
If I hadn't been there yesterday
to save her sorry ass,

07:17.145 --> 07:18.563
things could've gotten real ugly.

07:18.646 --> 07:20.648
-Well, it's a good thing you were.

07:20.731 --> 07:23.234
You know, and she thinks
that taking night classes

07:23.317 --> 07:27.029
taught by some sad-sack civilian is gonna
make her an expert on how to run a prison.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.114
You believe that?

07:29.615 --> 07:32.326
Professor Caputo. Hopper.

07:33.870 --> 07:36.122
Would you like to come in
and voice some of those concerns?

07:36.205 --> 07:39.167
The warden and I are about to discuss
the new educational programs.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.501
I'm here to volunteer,

07:40.585 --> 07:43.045
hoping to support what you guys are doing
to help the women.

07:43.129 --> 07:45.047
I'm sure you'd have
some valuable insights.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.340
No, I should get back.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.259
Somebody has to keep
an eye on the convicts.

07:52.096 --> 07:54.974
If you think of anything, my door is open.

07:57.435 --> 08:01.564
I haven't seen you in a while.
I thought you were done with all this.

08:01.647 --> 08:04.484
Nah. PolyCon's the biggest employer
in three counties

08:04.567 --> 08:06.569
and babies are expensive.

08:07.445 --> 08:11.699
We wanna make King a little brother
just as soon as Wanda is all healed up.

08:11.782 --> 08:14.785
You have a baby, too!

08:14.869 --> 08:20.082
Oh! You are so lucky
you get to see him every day.

08:20.833 --> 08:23.878
I miss my little mushkin so much.

08:23.961 --> 08:27.298
All the time I'm thinking,
"How is he doing"

08:27.381 --> 08:29.550
Although, he's not doing
so much at the moment.

08:29.634 --> 08:34.889
Mainly napping and taking
those little breaths. In, out.

08:34.972 --> 08:39.268
King snorts when he sleeps. It's so cute.
It's like a piglet.

08:42.313 --> 08:46.442
"King." Such a highfalutin name.

08:46.526 --> 08:50.363
I like how you didn't go for Duke or Earl.
You just went straight to the top.

08:50.446 --> 08:52.949
Well, we were gonna call him Scott Junior,

08:53.616 --> 08:57.245
but when he started crowning, I thought,
"What a beautiful word,"

08:57.328 --> 09:02.708
and his head was so big,
he just kept crowning and crowning,

09:03.459 --> 09:08.339
and I had a vision when he spewed forth
from his mother's ravaged passage.

09:11.509 --> 09:13.219
I'm sorry.

09:13.302 --> 09:16.889
Uh, I haven't been able
to share our birth story with many people.

09:17.473 --> 09:19.183
I know what you mean.

09:19.267 --> 09:24.105
After my emergency C-section,
I tried to sit up to assess the damage,

09:24.188 --> 09:26.816
and I realized I was cuffed to the table.

09:27.650 --> 09:31.070
That's gonna be a funny story
to tell Sterling one day, isn't it?

09:32.780 --> 09:34.115
They had to give me two pints of blood.

09:34.198 --> 09:37.159
I had a terrible fever
and these extremely engorged breasts,

09:37.243 --> 09:39.453
which is so painful,

09:39.537 --> 09:42.248
but at least Vinnie was there
and he got to see them.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.917
Oh, lactating breasts are a marvel.

09:45.001 --> 09:46.252
And the milk, it's so sweet.

09:46.335 --> 09:48.546
It tastes like Coffee mate,
French vanilla.

09:48.629 --> 09:49.630
Absolutely.

09:50.756 --> 09:52.592
I guess Lorna finally found someone

09:52.675 --> 09:55.177
who wants to talk about babies
as much as she does.

09:55.636 --> 09:59.265
Some men are truly transformed
by fatherhood.

09:59.348 --> 10:01.100
Dmitri was not one of them.

10:01.809 --> 10:05.730
Hey! There's my favorite
straight-shootin' Soviet.

10:05.813 --> 10:07.189
I guess you just needed a chance

10:07.273 --> 10:09.650
to boss some people around
with a slotted spoon.

10:10.985 --> 10:14.238
It does feel good
to do something I'm good at.

10:15.114 --> 10:16.907
People need a purpose.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.492
Okay, so here's my plan.

10:19.076 --> 10:21.746
I'm gonna borrow somebody's phone,
which you should also do--

10:21.829 --> 10:24.749
I can't get caught
with contraband.

10:24.832 --> 10:26.250
I'm getting out this summer.

10:26.334 --> 10:31.380
It's not a big deal. I borrow Zirconia's
to check my horoscope all the time.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.633
So I'm gonna start
with finding Maritza's mom, and you work on tracking down Diablo.

10:35.968 --> 10:37.553
I got to do things by the book.

10:38.346 --> 10:41.807
Look, I'll call my sons
from one of the regular prison phones

10:41.891 --> 10:44.268
and tell them to look Diablo up
on the computer or whatever,

10:44.352 --> 10:46.771
and that way I'm not breaking any rules.

10:46.854 --> 10:48.522
What are you saying right now?

10:49.482 --> 10:53.152
They're trapped, okay?
We're their only hope, Gloria.

10:53.235 --> 10:54.862
We have a mission to help them.

10:55.655 --> 10:56.614
We're their Obi-Wans.

10:56.697 --> 11:00.242
<i>Ay, nena, </i>I'm not a Jedi.
My only mission is to get back to my sons.

11:00.785 --> 11:03.037
Have you seen my suitcase?

11:03.120 --> 11:05.247
Where are you?

11:08.459 --> 11:11.337
Where are you, my loves?

11:12.672 --> 11:14.840
Where could they be?

11:15.675 --> 11:17.259
Hmm.

11:20.179 --> 11:21.806
You're not in the closet.

11:23.641 --> 11:24.892
Mom,

11:25.393 --> 11:28.854
have you seen any children around here?

11:28.938 --> 11:31.148
Children

11:32.441 --> 11:34.527
-Ah!

11:34.610 --> 11:37.488
When I find you,

11:37.571 --> 11:40.366
you're gonna get a big...

11:41.117 --> 11:42.952
hug!

11:44.161 --> 11:46.580
What's wrong, sweetie?

11:46.914 --> 11:48.374
She doesn't want you to go.

11:49.166 --> 11:50.000
Come here.

11:50.584 --> 11:51.752
We're gonna talk.

11:51.836 --> 11:54.004
We're gonna get this out of here,

11:54.922 --> 11:56.757
and then we're gonna make space for Mama.

11:56.841 --> 11:58.926
Everybody over here. Everybody over here.

12:01.262 --> 12:02.221
Okay.

12:03.764 --> 12:06.809
Look, I don't want to go either.

12:06.892 --> 12:09.562
Then why are you?

12:09.645 --> 12:11.564
We talked about this.

12:11.647 --> 12:13.065
I can't find a job here.

12:13.149 --> 12:18.320
In New York, I'll work hard,
and I'll be able to save money.

12:18.404 --> 12:24.118
We'll have our own apartment,
and you'll go to good schools,

12:24.660 --> 12:27.288
and we'll have a better life.

12:27.371 --> 12:31.709
And you know what? We won't all
have to sleep in the same bed.

12:32.084 --> 12:34.962
But I like sleeping in the same bed.

12:35.546 --> 12:38.299
I don't. You always kick me.

12:38.382 --> 12:41.594
That's 'cause you scratch me
with your toenails.

12:41.677 --> 12:45.931
Hey. In New York,
I'll buy you bunk beds.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.600
-Mmm-hmm.

12:47.683 --> 12:49.560
I get the top.

12:49.643 --> 12:54.440
See? It'll be a lot of fun.

12:57.151 --> 12:59.820
We'll be apart only for a while.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.907
And then we'll be together again.

13:02.990 --> 13:03.824
Okay?

13:04.533 --> 13:06.869
I know this is hard to understand,

13:07.828 --> 13:10.915
but I'm doing this for you.

13:11.999 --> 13:17.379
I would never ever, ever leave you
if I didn't have to.

14:17.731 --> 14:18.732
Damn.

14:23.112 --> 14:27.157
<i>♪ Updating my status</i>
<i>Reaping what I sow ♪</i>

14:27.241 --> 14:32.037
<i>♪ Nowhere to hide</i>
<i>On this logical plateau ♪</i>

14:36.500 --> 14:39.211
<i>♪ Gonna have to ♪</i>

14:44.008 --> 14:45.843
-You didn't line it up right.
-Hey!

14:46.343 --> 14:48.220
You know, when Sharon
showed you how to do this,

14:48.304 --> 14:50.014
I don't think listening to Pearl Jam
was part of it.

14:50.389 --> 14:53.976
No music in general? Or just specifically
no dated grunge music?

14:54.059 --> 14:59.732
Hmm. This task may not seem important
to you, but accounting is about precision.

14:59.815 --> 15:00.900
No music.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.111
-Keep your mind on your work.
-Got it.

15:06.488 --> 15:09.199
-Mind on work.

15:12.786 --> 15:15.581
I've been in here for 15 minutes.
I can't get caught in here.

15:15.664 --> 15:17.541
Sorry, sorry.

15:17.625 --> 15:22.129
I got stuck listening to Luschek go on
and on about that guy with two penises.

15:22.212 --> 15:24.506
-But my car's finally fixed,

15:24.590 --> 15:28.218
so thank baby Jesus
I don't have to ride with him anymore.

15:28.302 --> 15:31.805
He thinks if he plays enough
Huey Lewis &amp; The News, I'll suck his dick.

15:31.889 --> 15:34.391
Which I assume is a single.

15:34.475 --> 15:36.769
This isn't happy hour. I'm not here
to dish about your love life.

15:36.852 --> 15:37.978
What? Ew!

15:38.062 --> 15:40.856
-You brought it up.
-Yeah, because it's gross.

15:41.982 --> 15:43.609
I thought you'd understand.

15:52.493 --> 15:53.535
Whatever.

15:55.204 --> 15:56.455
Isn't there a...

15:57.164 --> 15:58.958
Oh, right.

16:06.173 --> 16:07.424
So this is the last time, right?

16:08.592 --> 16:10.803
It's going really well. See?

16:12.721 --> 16:14.390
There's perks in it for you, too.

16:15.474 --> 16:18.811
This isn't a perk.
This is a phone I asked you to get for me

16:18.894 --> 16:20.896
with the money I made
risking my ass for you.

16:22.606 --> 16:24.191
We're not done until I say we are.

16:25.734 --> 16:29.113
-And you should get a case for that.
-Cool. I'll pick one up at commissary.

16:29.196 --> 16:31.281
I don't think commissary sells...

16:31.365 --> 16:35.035
Oh! Funny. You're funny.

16:42.084 --> 16:44.461
-I don't see what difference it makes.

16:45.629 --> 16:49.216
Well, your fold takes this
from being a confusing one-sheet

16:49.299 --> 16:53.220
to an enticing pamphlet
that draws people into the programs.

16:53.512 --> 16:56.223
Let me just jump in my DeLorean,
go back in time and get right on that.

16:57.349 --> 17:00.227
Or you could sit right there
and do it in the present.

17:06.525 --> 17:07.568
Does this work?

17:09.486 --> 17:10.654
Yeah, all set.

17:10.738 --> 17:15.159
Just push this button to unmute,
and don't pop your P's.

17:15.868 --> 17:17.077
Pop my P's?

17:18.537 --> 17:21.331
Just sit back from the mic and relax.

17:24.501 --> 17:26.879
Good morning, Litchfield residents.

17:27.421 --> 17:29.548
This is Warden Ward with a special...

17:32.968 --> 17:34.261
an important...

17:35.971 --> 17:37.181
Relax.

17:39.641 --> 17:40.642
...announcement.

17:42.144 --> 17:43.687
I'm excited to tell you

17:43.771 --> 17:48.734
about several new educational programs
we're now providing.

17:49.526 --> 17:52.696
Residents who participate
in these programs

17:52.780 --> 17:58.452
will be eligible for special privileges,
like extra yard time.

17:59.620 --> 18:06.543
But we hope the real incentive will be
the opportunity for personal growth.

18:07.669 --> 18:13.509
I encourage you to read the pamphlets
being distributed today and sign up.

18:14.635 --> 18:17.763
You never know what you're capable of
until you try.

18:26.897 --> 18:30.776
Did you ever think avoiding work
takes more effort than doing it?

18:33.028 --> 18:34.029
No.

18:37.241 --> 18:38.867
Everybody take a pamphlet.

18:45.207 --> 18:46.458
It's a sheet of paper.

18:47.084 --> 18:48.710
It's a fold-your-own situation.

18:50.254 --> 18:53.757
Hey. Do you maybe wanna
learn and grow with me?

18:54.842 --> 18:56.718
Get the fuck out of Florida for a while?

18:58.679 --> 19:01.723
I mean, ever since kickball season ended,
I'm all antsy in my pantsy

19:01.807 --> 19:03.725
being stuck in here all the time.

19:06.812 --> 19:07.813
Hello?

19:11.859 --> 19:14.319
Is that another one
of your sexy, kooky space stories?

19:14.403 --> 19:16.947
No! This is the truth.

19:17.573 --> 19:20.742
Because the truth isn't the truth.

19:21.368 --> 19:24.705
And I don't even like talking about it,
because it zaps my energy to write it.

19:25.706 --> 19:26.623
Okay.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.376
See?

19:30.752 --> 19:32.296
Now I don't feel like writing about it.

19:35.424 --> 19:36.592
I need peace and quiet.

19:38.844 --> 19:40.387
-Hey.
-Sorry, sorry, sorry.

19:40.470 --> 19:43.724
Writing mode. Or non-writing mode.
I didn't see you.

19:43.807 --> 19:48.270
Actually, actually, um,
you could answer some questions.

19:48.353 --> 19:50.480
That might put me back into writing mode.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.316
-That would be very--
-Fuck, Suzanne.

19:52.399 --> 19:54.860
Now, this is important.
It's to fix things with you and Taystee.

19:54.943 --> 19:57.613
Stop. Stop.

19:58.572 --> 20:00.073
What's done is done.

20:00.449 --> 20:03.577
There's no use in thinking about it
or talking to you about it.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.874
There's no fixing it, so just step off.

20:13.462 --> 20:16.006
Good dialogue. I'm gonna add that.

20:17.674 --> 20:19.176
Yo, Berlin.

20:19.718 --> 20:22.221
I know the COs don't want to mess
with people's crazy in Florida,

20:22.304 --> 20:24.139
but ain't this a bit much?

20:24.848 --> 20:25.891
Where am I supposed to sit?

20:32.731 --> 20:35.984
You really need 27 empty pudding cups?

20:37.236 --> 20:40.280
You shouldn't be eating in here.
It's unsanitary.

20:56.964 --> 20:57.965
See?

21:02.636 --> 21:05.430
Good morning, ladies.
I see you got the pamphlets.

21:09.351 --> 21:11.436
Do you have any questions
about the programs?

21:11.520 --> 21:14.314
I think the spoken word class
should be really fun.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.858
I... Actually, I have a question.

21:16.942 --> 21:21.363
Um, what exactly are the incentives?
Because this pamphlet doesn't really say.

21:21.446 --> 21:22.990
I think we should get conjugals.

21:23.573 --> 21:25.492
You get to leave the block.

21:27.494 --> 21:30.289
Do something constructive with your time.

21:30.831 --> 21:33.500
Since you're in here,
you might as well try to work on yourself.

21:33.583 --> 21:35.377
Prepare for life after Litchfield.

21:53.020 --> 21:56.148
You know, I could have transferred you
and not Murphy?

21:57.024 --> 21:58.400
Why didn't you?

22:00.569 --> 22:02.195
I heard your appeal was denied.

22:03.864 --> 22:04.865
Yep.

22:07.492 --> 22:08.535
I'm sorry.

22:11.621 --> 22:13.332
Mr. Caputo told me, during the riot,

22:13.415 --> 22:16.835
one of your demands
was to reinstate the GED program.

22:18.670 --> 22:22.591
I think you're right, and I want
to make this a different kind of prison.

22:22.674 --> 22:25.719
So people still feel like people
while they're in here.

22:26.470 --> 22:31.475
Yeah, don't act like your new programs
have anything to do with me or the riot.

22:32.851 --> 22:36.605
Taystee, I can make
what you wanted happen.

22:41.943 --> 22:43.528
So what now?

22:44.905 --> 22:47.282
Now you sit around all day,
waiting to die?

22:49.076 --> 22:51.161
I really think
you should see yourself out.

22:51.244 --> 22:53.538
Taystee, this is not you.

22:53.622 --> 22:55.791
You gotta figure out a way
to live while you're in here.

22:55.874 --> 22:57.834
No, I don't.

22:57.918 --> 23:00.796
I'm trying to find a way
to make it better for you.

23:00.879 --> 23:03.048
-To make it--
-If I wanted one of your lectures,

23:03.131 --> 23:07.260
I would've signed up
for one of your stupid fucking classes.

23:21.358 --> 23:22.609
Aww!

23:22.692 --> 23:26.405
Hello, sweetheart.
This is such a nice surprise.

23:26.488 --> 23:28.448
I wasn't expecting you till next week.

23:29.366 --> 23:30.784
You look beautiful.

23:30.867 --> 23:34.871
I would like to be dolled up
for you, but I am not.

23:34.955 --> 23:39.376
You look a little rough yourself.
Hey, what is this

23:40.669 --> 23:42.462
I didn't sleep last night.

23:42.546 --> 23:45.632
Oh, sweetie, you are such a good daddy.

23:47.634 --> 23:49.803
Are you reading to him every night?

23:50.345 --> 23:54.349
Are you telling him that I love him?

23:54.433 --> 23:56.435
How's our little mucci

23:58.812 --> 24:01.731
Lorna, listen. I got bad news.

24:02.858 --> 24:04.109
Sterling's...

24:05.402 --> 24:07.404
Sterling's lungs... He got...

24:09.614 --> 24:11.491
Sterling's lungs... He got pneumonia.

24:13.034 --> 24:15.162
Oh! Oh, no.

24:15.787 --> 24:19.374
But they're taking care of him,
and they're giving him the antibiotics.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.251
Yeah, but that didn't work.

24:23.837 --> 24:27.841
Well, what are they gonna do now?
You should be with him.

24:27.924 --> 24:30.802
You know, I bet they would
let me out of the prison

24:30.886 --> 24:33.013
-because it sounds like he's really sick.
-Lorna...

24:33.096 --> 24:34.514
Yeah, he needs me.
-They did everything.

24:34.598 --> 24:36.850
-I'm his mother.
-He was on this ventilator,

24:36.933 --> 24:38.894
and he had all these tubes in him,

24:38.977 --> 24:43.064
and there were so many doctors
I couldn't even see him.

24:44.191 --> 24:47.736
And then they let me hold him
for a very long time afterwards, but...

24:52.824 --> 24:53.950
we lost him.

24:58.788 --> 25:00.248
We lost him.

25:17.557 --> 25:18.558
<i>Hello?</i>

25:18.642 --> 25:20.227
Hi, is this Maria Ramos?

25:20.310 --> 25:21.561
<i>Yes, who's this?</i>

25:21.645 --> 25:23.063
Hi, this is Marisol.

25:23.146 --> 25:25.106
I'm not a debt collector
or a telemarketer.

25:25.190 --> 25:28.401
I'm calling for Maritza Ramos.
Do you know her?

25:31.988 --> 25:33.073
Fuck.

25:43.124 --> 25:46.044
<i>We're sorry, the number you--</i>
Oh, my God.

25:54.135 --> 25:55.220
<i>Hello?</i>

25:55.303 --> 25:57.722
<i>-Yes.</i>

25:58.807 --> 26:03.061
Really? Oh, my God.
Are you the Maria Ramos, Maritza's mom?

26:03.395 --> 26:04.729
Yes. What's going on?

26:04.813 --> 26:06.565
Hi, I'm her best friend Flaca,

26:06.648 --> 26:08.942
and I know you wouldn't take her calls
when she got out of prison but this is an emergency, so please--

26:11.403 --> 26:12.404
Is Maritza okay?

26:12.487 --> 26:15.949
No, she's in immigration prison
because she doesn't have her ID.

26:16.575 --> 26:19.744
She needs her US birth certificate
to prove that she's a citizen.

26:22.914 --> 26:23.999
I don't have it.

26:24.082 --> 26:28.211
Okay, well, can you, like, go to the
record place and get her a replacement?

26:30.797 --> 26:33.592
No, what I'm saying is there isn't one.

26:34.509 --> 26:35.885
Maritza wasn't born here.

26:39.389 --> 26:41.016
Oh, my God.

26:42.892 --> 26:45.770
Okay, I have a meeting across town,
so I'll see you all tomorrow.

26:45.854 --> 26:48.064
-Bye. Have a good one.
-See you later, Mr. Chapman.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.484
Wait. Can I ask you something?

26:53.028 --> 26:53.987
Wow!

26:54.487 --> 26:57.365
Mom's Bitmoji game is strong, huh?

26:57.449 --> 27:00.035
It's weird how much that looks like her.

27:00.118 --> 27:02.245
Yeah, and I'm the one
who showed her how to do it.

27:02.329 --> 27:04.331
Now I'm married to a chipper meme.

27:05.957 --> 27:11.212
Hey, I was wondering if I could have
Friday afternoon off to go visit Alex.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.632
I'll make sure I'm ahead of schedule
with all the scanning.

27:13.715 --> 27:17.260
Your vacation time starts to accrue
after 90 days, same as anybody else.

27:18.303 --> 27:20.013
I can work a full day on Saturday
to make up for it.

27:20.096 --> 27:22.891
No, Piper. I'm not gonna
give you special treatment.

27:28.772 --> 27:30.273
-Yeah.

27:30.357 --> 27:31.733
Coast is clear.

27:32.567 --> 27:35.111
Have you seen this video
of the monkeys driving the car?

27:35.195 --> 27:37.072
Oh! I love that one! Wait for me!

27:37.656 --> 27:39.074
Skip ad. Skip ad.

27:39.699 --> 27:42.410
It's hump day.

27:44.245 --> 27:46.873
-Thank you.

27:46.956 --> 27:50.502
Watch, watch.
He's gonna put his hand on the dog's butt.

27:50.585 --> 27:52.379
-There!

27:53.254 --> 27:55.006
Piper, have you seen this?

27:55.090 --> 27:56.299
Want a little taste?

27:56.383 --> 27:57.676
Thanks, but I can't.

27:58.093 --> 27:59.844
Oh, sorry. Sober?

27:59.928 --> 28:04.099
No. Um, well, for the moment.

28:04.766 --> 28:06.059
Maybe she's pregnant.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.814
-That smells like love.
-I'll grab the plates!

28:10.897 --> 28:13.066
No, we can't eat it yet. It's for Heather. She comes back Friday
from maternity leave.

28:15.402 --> 28:17.654
And remember how
she had gestational diabetes?

28:17.737 --> 28:19.239
I thought we could all do
our cheat day then

28:19.322 --> 28:21.491
and get regular diabetes with her.

28:21.574 --> 28:24.661
Why not buy it on Friday so it's fresh?

28:24.744 --> 28:27.414
They had a hump day special.
Ten percent off.

28:27.497 --> 28:30.041
It's like an iced latte.
It'll still be good. Speaking of cheating,
I think I'm gonna go ahead and slip out.

28:33.586 --> 28:35.839
-Oh, yes, yes.
-It's already 3:30.

28:35.922 --> 28:38.007
You should feel free to go, too.
Walk out with us.

28:38.091 --> 28:39.926
I wish I could, but I really can't.

28:41.219 --> 28:42.303
No judgment.

28:43.346 --> 28:45.014
Of course, I'm not gonna say anything.

28:45.682 --> 28:48.601
I'm just trying out a new way of life.

28:48.685 --> 28:49.811
Good for you.

28:49.894 --> 28:55.024
You know, if I had your discipline,
I'd be able to zip my pants.

28:55.108 --> 28:58.611
-Tutu! Ta-ta! TTFN, gals!
Bye.

28:59.237 --> 29:02.365
Stretchy waistbands.
It's all about the stretchy waistbands.

29:05.034 --> 29:08.705
Hello, hello, hello, hello!
What's good? Welcome all.

29:08.788 --> 29:11.750
Even got a pink who wants to think
up in this clink.

29:11.833 --> 29:16.171
So what
That sounds like a waste of time.

29:16.254 --> 29:17.505
Hey, you did it.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.883
Spoken word is actually
one of the oldest art forms.

29:19.966 --> 29:21.384
Yeah, 'cause it's just talking.

29:22.093 --> 29:24.053
Give it a try. Close your eyes.

29:26.222 --> 29:29.434
Let yourself go.

29:30.351 --> 29:35.940
Slip, trip, flip into the dream,
stream of consciousness.

29:36.941 --> 29:37.942
What do you see?

29:38.026 --> 29:41.821
Uh... Darkness. Glowing spots.
Like jelly worms.

29:41.905 --> 29:45.241
All right, I'm gonna stop you right there.
What you gotta do is--

29:45.325 --> 29:46.451
Not this.

29:46.534 --> 29:48.161
You see them. Jelly worms.

29:48.244 --> 29:53.124
Walk. Walk away.
Walk like Rosa Parks did not.

30:15.688 --> 30:17.774
A single for this reliable customer.

30:22.529 --> 30:23.988
Beautiful. Thanks.

30:30.703 --> 30:32.080
Visitor's bathroom.

30:32.163 --> 30:34.249
But you said if I broke up with Annalisa,
I could do floors.

30:34.332 --> 30:35.917
I didn't say you could be late.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.093
You're not a member of the cleaning crew,

30:45.176 --> 30:47.971
and you're not a known patron
of our clandestine business.

30:48.429 --> 30:49.430
Yo, can I talk to you?

30:49.806 --> 30:51.516
It's okay. She's cool.

30:54.936 --> 30:56.145
In private?

30:57.063 --> 30:58.189
Step into my office.

31:06.531 --> 31:10.702
I need a sight line. I am not listening,
except for sounds of discord.

31:17.333 --> 31:18.334
What's up?

31:19.669 --> 31:21.421
All right, I heard about Daddy.

31:22.630 --> 31:25.592
And I want whatever it is you have
to take someone out.

31:26.426 --> 31:29.262
Well, if you wanna use my bath salts
to take a bitch out,

31:29.345 --> 31:30.972
you gotta ask me first.

31:31.764 --> 31:32.849
Isn't that what I'm doing?

31:34.767 --> 31:39.731
Yeah, you're right.
Thanks. So who's it for?

31:40.523 --> 31:42.275
It's better if you don't know.

31:43.318 --> 31:45.111
That's disrespectful-ass shit.

31:46.237 --> 31:48.239
If I don't know, you don't get nothing.

31:49.741 --> 31:50.950
It's for me.

31:51.701 --> 31:53.161
I know, but who's it for?

31:54.954 --> 31:57.165
It's for me.

31:59.792 --> 32:00.710
Oh.

32:01.878 --> 32:02.921
Shit.

32:04.380 --> 32:06.424
Well, why you wanna do that for?

32:06.507 --> 32:09.385
Come on, man.
Don't act like you don't think about it.

32:09.469 --> 32:11.387
Every night you're in here alone.

32:11.471 --> 32:14.557
Nah. 'Cause thinking about shit
fucks you up.

32:15.683 --> 32:16.851
Here.

32:16.935 --> 32:19.479
This shit is gonna make you
feel good inside the bad.

32:19.562 --> 32:20.855
No, man.

32:21.397 --> 32:23.524
You don't want the drugs?
But you want the drugs.

32:23.983 --> 32:26.653
I mean, it's every night
for the rest of your life.

32:26.736 --> 32:30.907
Looking at the same fucking darkness
in the same fucking box.

32:31.491 --> 32:33.743
-It's 20,000 nights.

32:34.410 --> 32:36.162
Wow.

32:40.541 --> 32:42.460
I'm not gonna bump my way
through this, all right?

32:42.543 --> 32:44.504
Every day that I'm in here, they win.

32:44.587 --> 32:46.506
Well, don't they win
if you take your life away?

32:46.589 --> 32:48.633
No. They want me alive
so I can stay in prison.

32:48.716 --> 32:50.927
Don't you feel how fucked up that is?

32:51.010 --> 32:53.888
But if I'm not alive,
then I'm not in prison.

32:53.972 --> 32:57.850
That's the only way that I can have
some kind of control over my own life.

32:57.934 --> 32:59.477
But if you do this,
then your life is over.

32:59.560 --> 33:00.979
Are you a therapist or a dealer?

33:01.062 --> 33:02.313
-I'm a dealer.
-All right.

33:02.397 --> 33:04.607
You're gonna pay the price
like everybody else in here.

33:04.691 --> 33:05.900
-A G.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.695
-Mmm-mmm.

33:08.778 --> 33:10.863
I thought you would understand,
out of all these people.

33:10.947 --> 33:12.907
Well, if I get another OD in there,

33:12.991 --> 33:15.326
the cops are gonna make it even harder
for me to get drugs in here.

33:15.410 --> 33:18.121
You know how long it's gonna take me
to find that kind of money?

33:19.163 --> 33:20.748
You got somewhere to be?

33:24.502 --> 33:26.671
It's cool.

33:30.717 --> 33:33.845
These for your papier-mâché
hot

33:35.263 --> 33:38.599
Gonna tear those into scraps
and use them to fluff up my pillow.

33:39.100 --> 33:41.269
Only thing they're good for.

33:42.186 --> 33:44.105
Uh... do you mind?

33:52.030 --> 33:54.115
"Art of Spoken Word."

33:54.741 --> 33:56.159
Art of my ass.

33:56.242 --> 33:57.827
"Hooked on Crochet."

33:58.202 --> 34:02.331
"Restorative Justice:
Reconciling with Your Past."

34:02.415 --> 34:05.209
Oh, let's sit in a circle
and cry about it.

34:06.669 --> 34:09.297
So you don't have any regrets
about anything?

34:11.049 --> 34:13.509
What's done is done.

34:14.427 --> 34:16.137
Now, you can't get back your past

34:16.220 --> 34:18.598
any more than you can get back your turds
once you flush 'em.

34:19.307 --> 34:21.392
Provided the toilet ain't clogged. Maybe you can't get it back, but...

34:28.274 --> 34:29.275
what about...

34:31.402 --> 34:32.945
making amends?

34:34.197 --> 34:35.448
Reconciliation? No such thing.

34:41.329 --> 34:44.290
Dude, come on.
We got to do something about the roaches.

34:44.582 --> 34:46.459
Don't be so afraid of 'em.

34:46.542 --> 34:49.295
They're survivors. They're industrious.

34:50.421 --> 34:54.675
And if it comes down to it,
they're not afraid to eat their own.

34:56.552 --> 34:58.596
You and I know all about that.

35:04.310 --> 35:06.145
<i>What do we know about ourselves?</i>

35:06.521 --> 35:09.982
Restorative justice can help us understand
why we did what we did.

35:10.733 --> 35:14.112
It can help us feel
the effects of our actions

35:14.195 --> 35:16.489
on the people we may have hurt. In this--

35:16.572 --> 35:18.991
But I like what it says in the pamphlet.
You are not your crime.

35:19.075 --> 35:21.077
True. But your crime is a part of you.

35:21.661 --> 35:26.833
In this class, we'll do the work
to take responsibility for our actions.

35:26.916 --> 35:29.794
Yeah, so we just come here
and feel bad about ourselves.

35:29.877 --> 35:34.257
You can take responsibility for something
you did and not feel bad about yourself.

35:35.716 --> 35:39.512
Sometimes I do things
that make my girlfriend feel bad.

35:39.595 --> 35:41.222
-So bad.

35:42.265 --> 35:44.475
Oh, say-- say I forgot her birthday,

35:45.601 --> 35:51.357
because I didn't know it to begin with
and she seems kind of immortal to me,

35:51.440 --> 35:53.901
not like a real human
who would have a birthday.

35:56.279 --> 35:57.905
But that made her feel bad.

35:58.865 --> 36:01.617
And I didn't intend to cause harm,
but I did.

36:01.701 --> 36:03.327
I could take responsibility for that

36:03.411 --> 36:07.623
and also give myself a break
because we all fuck up.

36:07.707 --> 36:10.459
Is that why you're here?
Because you fucked up?

36:10.543 --> 36:13.588
Yeah, aren't you the warden
who lost control of the cookie prison?

36:16.090 --> 36:22.180
I'm here because I had
a variety of experiences at Litchfield

36:22.263 --> 36:25.725
that I hope make me helpful
as a facilitator.

36:26.058 --> 36:29.061
But, uh,
we're all on this journey together.

36:29.145 --> 36:33.691
How can we be on a journey together
with someone who harmed us? On purpose.

36:34.025 --> 36:35.026
Named Beth.

36:35.818 --> 36:39.030
Hypothetically, that person
needs to accept their guilt

36:39.655 --> 36:42.658
and see if there's a way
to make restitution.

36:42.742 --> 36:44.410
And this is the perfect place to do that.

36:45.286 --> 36:49.707
But we will talk more about that in...
I think it's-- it's week six.

36:49.790 --> 36:52.835
It says in week seven
that we meet our victims.

36:52.919 --> 36:54.253
So, like, they come here to visit?

36:54.337 --> 36:56.005
Well, it's not possible in every case.

36:56.297 --> 36:57.173
Like for Beth.

36:58.883 --> 37:01.636
'Cause she killed her kids,
so they're dead.

37:02.386 --> 37:03.721
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

37:03.804 --> 37:05.181
Let's read about some of the differences

37:05.264 --> 37:07.975
between restorative justice
and criminal justice.

37:08.059 --> 37:10.937
Uh, it's page three in the folder.

37:11.687 --> 37:14.190
Ms. Doggett, will you start us off?

37:14.273 --> 37:15.733
All right.

37:19.111 --> 37:24.075
"Criminal justice takes a punitive
and adverserial--"

37:24.158 --> 37:26.619
I think it's "adversarial."

37:27.119 --> 37:31.499
Oh. You think?
And I think you should read it.

37:36.128 --> 37:38.339
"Criminal justice takes a punitive..."

37:41.467 --> 37:44.053
I tried again. No answer.

37:44.136 --> 37:45.763
I can't seem to catch 'em between school

37:45.846 --> 37:49.308
and Julio's soccer practice, Benny's PT.

37:49.392 --> 37:50.559
But they're working on it.

37:50.643 --> 37:52.937
And Lourdes is making
some phone calls, too.

37:53.938 --> 37:55.523
-Yeah, but--

37:55.606 --> 37:57.900
Don't open the window
till you're ready for business.

37:57.984 --> 37:59.068
They swarm.

37:59.151 --> 38:01.821
No congregating. Get back.

38:02.446 --> 38:05.449
Um, Morello's not here.
We need extra help.

38:05.533 --> 38:06.701
They used to work with me.

38:07.827 --> 38:11.330
I'll give you one.
But they don't get paid.

38:11.414 --> 38:15.209
My understanding is they don't wanna work
if there's nothing in it for them.

38:15.293 --> 38:16.627
Typical.

38:17.044 --> 38:18.004
-You go.
-I'll go.

38:19.005 --> 38:19.964
You're welcome.

38:20.047 --> 38:23.509
Where is Morello? And don't tell me
she'd rather scrub toilets.

38:23.592 --> 38:28.723
So Ginger said medical. I asked why,
and she said, "Bad case of nunya."

38:29.181 --> 38:33.894
I heard they have to break
your toe to fix that. Poor girl.

38:34.603 --> 38:36.939
No, no, no. You're thinking of bunions.

38:37.023 --> 38:39.692
This is "nunya," like,
"None of ya business."

38:39.775 --> 38:41.444
Watch those chicken...

38:42.820 --> 38:44.989
Hey. Are you serving me now?

38:45.281 --> 38:48.868
Yes. I would like that. To serve you.

38:49.201 --> 38:50.202
...breasts!

38:58.961 --> 39:01.005
Yo. You found her? You're my hero!

39:01.464 --> 39:04.342
You know what?
This potato probably came from Canada or Ireland or some other country
and nobody cares.

39:07.386 --> 39:11.098
Nobody says, "Send the potato back
to Canada where it doesn't know anybody,

39:11.182 --> 39:14.143
because there's no birth certificate."
That would be so dumb,

39:14.226 --> 39:19.565
and a waste of a smart, sexy,
funny, BFF-like potato.

39:19.648 --> 39:22.234
Wait. Am I the potato?

39:24.445 --> 39:26.405
Why is a piece of paper so important?

39:26.489 --> 39:28.407
Why is that what says you're American,

39:28.491 --> 39:30.951
and not, like,
knowing all the lyrics to "Tik Tok"

39:31.035 --> 39:33.329
or how to do ribbon highlights
that make you look sexy

39:33.412 --> 39:34.747
and not like a Jersey ho?

39:34.830 --> 39:36.248
I can't lose you again.

39:36.332 --> 39:38.834
Why don't you go to the window
and help out over there? Come on.

39:38.918 --> 39:40.211
What's going on? Tell me.

39:44.423 --> 39:46.008
Your mom says you were born in Colombia.

39:46.092 --> 39:49.011
And getting you out of here is gonna be
a little bit harder than we thought.

39:51.555 --> 39:52.473
How?

39:54.475 --> 39:55.601
She lied to me?

39:58.604 --> 40:00.481
But I've never lived anywhere else.

40:01.690 --> 40:02.775
Oh.

40:03.859 --> 40:05.569
Yeah, of course she lied to me,

40:05.653 --> 40:09.240
because she's a lying,
selfish, idiot cunt.

40:09.990 --> 40:12.701
Your mother was running
from a terrible situation

40:12.785 --> 40:14.286
to give you a better life.

40:14.370 --> 40:18.124
Whatever mistakes she made,
I'm sure she was doing her best.

40:19.625 --> 40:21.460
What the fuck do you know about it?

40:25.923 --> 40:26.757
Hi!

40:27.883 --> 40:29.927
Yes.

40:30.010 --> 40:34.140
It's so hot. I thought we could splurge
and take a cab home today.

40:34.223 --> 40:35.558
Yes! We can take a cab!

40:35.641 --> 40:38.102
Okay, good. You shouldn't be walking
so much in this heat.

40:38.185 --> 40:39.186
You're right.

40:39.270 --> 40:44.233
Hey, let's stop by that Thai massage place
where they do those amazing shoulder rubs.

40:44.316 --> 40:46.152
What's going on?
Did you win a scratch

40:46.235 --> 40:49.447
No, it's better than that.
Here. Take my picture.

40:50.197 --> 40:52.366
I want to remember this day.

40:52.450 --> 40:53.576
-Yes.

40:54.201 --> 40:55.035
Okay.

40:55.828 --> 40:57.621
But look, can you see the sign?

40:57.705 --> 40:58.581
Okay.

41:00.749 --> 41:02.334
Give me a moment. Let's see.

41:02.418 --> 41:05.421
-Make sure the sign is in it.
Yes, I got the sign.

41:06.589 --> 41:08.507
Ah, good! Thank you.

41:11.135 --> 41:12.970
-Guess what.

41:15.514 --> 41:16.974
This is going to be my store.

41:17.391 --> 41:22.354
Mr. George wants to retire,
and he offered to make me a part owner.

41:22.771 --> 41:26.400
So he's just giving you
a part of his business?

41:26.859 --> 41:28.110
I don't understand.

41:28.194 --> 41:32.948
No, I buy half now,
and eventually I can buy the other half.

41:33.407 --> 41:37.036
But that must cost thousands of dollars!
You don't have that kind of money.

41:37.786 --> 41:39.163
I'll use what I've been saving,

41:39.246 --> 41:42.625
and he said I can make payments
out of my salary for the rest.

41:43.083 --> 41:46.629
I thought you were saving that money
for an apartment.

41:47.004 --> 41:48.214
What about the girls?

41:48.631 --> 41:49.548
It'll take longer,

41:49.632 --> 41:52.510
but I'll be able to afford an apartment
in a better neighborhood.

41:52.593 --> 41:53.969
No offense.

41:54.053 --> 41:57.264
There are good people in my neighborhood.
Hard workers.

41:57.348 --> 42:02.853
I know, I'm one of them!
But it's not the best for kids.

42:02.937 --> 42:08.651
Now I can afford a place in a really safe
neighborhood with a great school.

42:08.734 --> 42:12.279
That's not going to be right now, Gloria.

42:12.363 --> 42:16.242
In another year. Or what, two
How much longer?

42:16.325 --> 42:21.121
Kids don't understand "safe neighborhood"
or "great school."

42:21.205 --> 42:22.498
They want their mom.

42:22.581 --> 42:25.501
What use am I to them
if I can't give them a better life?

42:25.584 --> 42:27.628
I thought you would be happy for me.

42:27.711 --> 42:30.130
You know what? You shouldn't
make this decision right now.

42:30.214 --> 42:31.549
Why not?

42:31.632 --> 42:32.466
Taxi!

42:32.550 --> 42:34.426
Lourdes, why not

42:34.510 --> 42:36.387
Yes, because you're pregnant.

42:36.470 --> 42:39.431
And because you picked another man
who wouldn't stick around

42:39.515 --> 42:41.559
-to provide for his kids!

42:41.976 --> 42:42.935
Are you coming?

42:46.605 --> 42:48.190
I think you need to get off your feet.

42:48.816 --> 42:49.817
I'll walk.

42:50.859 --> 42:52.736
I know what's best for me.

42:52.820 --> 42:53.946
And my family.

43:02.288 --> 43:03.205
Hello?

43:03.289 --> 43:04.248
<i>Hey, wifey.</i>

43:05.249 --> 43:08.294
Alex! How are you calling me?
Is everything okay?

43:08.586 --> 43:11.088
Yeah, it's fine. I'm in my cell.

43:11.463 --> 43:14.049
Nobody can hear me
and Creech sleeps like the dead.

43:14.133 --> 43:15.718
So you have a phone?

43:15.801 --> 43:17.219
<i>Yes, I got a phone.</i>

43:17.303 --> 43:19.888
Because I really need to be able
to talk to you without someone listening.

43:19.972 --> 43:20.973
Alex.

43:22.975 --> 43:24.143
I'm not upset.

43:25.060 --> 43:28.647
Honestly, I've been so worried.

43:29.690 --> 43:32.860
But I'm sure whatever I'm imagining
is far worse than the reality.

43:33.902 --> 43:36.071
Worse than being forced
to sell heroin for Hellman?

43:36.655 --> 43:38.240
-<i>I wish.</i>

43:38.824 --> 43:40.659
But the good news is
I'm not doing that anymore.

43:42.328 --> 43:48.000
Okay, yeah. It's fantastic
that you're no longer selling heroin.

43:48.083 --> 43:51.086
McCullough got me out of it, but...

43:52.546 --> 43:55.049
I have to sell
phone chargers for her.

43:55.132 --> 43:58.552
So it's still shitty, but at least
it's not heroin and it's not Hellman.

43:59.553 --> 44:01.347
And that's how I made the money
to buy this phone

44:01.430 --> 44:03.223
so I could tell you this fun story.

44:05.601 --> 44:06.852
<i>Piper?</i>

44:06.935 --> 44:10.064
I'm here. I'm just processing.

44:10.356 --> 44:12.399
I'm sorry. It's not what I wanted.

44:12.483 --> 44:14.276
But in order
for this relationship to work,

44:14.360 --> 44:15.486
we need to be honest with each other.

44:15.903 --> 44:19.239
In order for this relationship to work,
you have to get out of prison someday.

44:20.240 --> 44:21.659
You said you would trust me.

44:22.242 --> 44:24.912
You think I would have done this
if I had any other choice?

44:24.995 --> 44:27.206
Hellman shoved heroin down my throat. And by that I mean I had to swallow it
and shit it out.

44:29.958 --> 44:31.502
<i>Do you know how dangerous that is?</i>

44:31.835 --> 44:33.212
So you can't be mad at me.

44:33.754 --> 44:38.092
Alex, that's so much worse than anything
I've been imagining. That's assault.

44:38.175 --> 44:43.263
That's abuse, coercion.
Can we file a complaint or a report or...

44:43.347 --> 44:46.225
Yeah, I did. That's why I ended up
dealing for McCullough.

44:46.975 --> 44:48.227
Lot of straight arrows in here.

44:48.310 --> 44:50.979
-There has to be something that we can do.
<i>There isn't.</i>

44:52.731 --> 44:56.276
You can't help me.
I just needed to tell you.

44:59.196 --> 45:00.614
I don't know what to say.

45:01.615 --> 45:03.117
<i>How's work?</i>

45:06.495 --> 45:07.496
So lame.

45:07.579 --> 45:08.622
You wanna tell me about it?

45:12.292 --> 45:14.628
My father won't let me
come see you on Friday.

45:16.839 --> 45:20.259
Oh, Bill. Should I send someone
to fuck him up?

45:21.844 --> 45:23.971
I'm sorry I won't be able to be there.

45:26.473 --> 45:28.058
At least we have a way to talk now.

45:30.811 --> 45:34.940
Yes. At least we have that.

45:45.909 --> 45:47.619
This is GED. You're not signed up.

45:47.995 --> 45:49.538
I know. School sucks.

45:51.290 --> 45:53.000
What other programs you got?

45:57.212 --> 45:59.590
Looks like the only one
you haven't been to yet is crochet.

46:00.758 --> 46:02.760
Starts in half an hour in Florida.

46:02.843 --> 46:05.345
Oh, man. The whole point
is to get out of Florida.

46:05.429 --> 46:06.388
School does suck.

46:08.223 --> 46:11.018
Nice to meet you, Ms...

46:11.727 --> 46:14.396
Tiffany. I mean, Doggett.

46:14.980 --> 46:16.648
All right, well, come on,
Ms. Tiffany Doggett,

46:16.732 --> 46:18.817
let's talk about why school sucks.

46:18.901 --> 46:20.277
Everyone.

46:20.360 --> 46:21.528
School.

46:22.571 --> 46:24.239
That's why we're all here, right?

46:26.533 --> 46:30.662
Why does school

46:30.746 --> 46:33.916
suck so bad?

46:36.418 --> 46:37.503
Anyone?

46:38.170 --> 46:41.089
Come on, you all must've hated something
or else you would have graduated.

46:41.381 --> 46:42.299
Homework.

46:42.382 --> 46:43.675
Tests.

46:43.759 --> 46:47.095
I actually really liked school,
but my socioeconomic circumstances

46:47.179 --> 46:49.306
dictated that I drop out
to earn my keep, so...

46:49.389 --> 46:51.183
Okay, well, glad to have you
with us here now.

46:51.266 --> 46:53.519
Teachers who think
they're better than you.

46:53.602 --> 46:55.395
Okay, I hope we can turn that one around.

46:55.479 --> 46:57.022
Teachers that talk
about turning things around.

46:58.607 --> 46:59.733
You're quick, Ms. Doggett.

47:00.317 --> 47:02.152
But I also don't like reading,

47:02.236 --> 47:07.616
math, science, writing, calculators,
the way chalk sounds,

47:07.699 --> 47:11.995
and I don't like the way it smells like
soggy square pizza mixed with sadness.

47:13.163 --> 47:16.166
Wow. Thank you. Anyone else?

47:17.376 --> 47:19.086
Fake bitches thinking they cute.

47:21.463 --> 47:27.427
Okay. Now, personally,
I liked that part of school, but...

47:28.428 --> 47:30.806
let's talk about this sentence.

47:32.057 --> 47:35.060
This is how people talk.

47:35.769 --> 47:37.271
Sounds good.

47:37.354 --> 47:40.524
And it works, meaning that it effectively
conveys the speaker's thoughts.

47:40.607 --> 47:42.067
But in order to pass the GED,

47:42.150 --> 47:45.279
you all need to become proficient
in reading and writing standard English.

47:45.362 --> 47:46.572
You mean white English.

47:46.655 --> 47:49.533
Well, there are plenty of white people
who aren't proficient in standard English,

47:49.616 --> 47:50.826
but you make an astute point.

47:50.909 --> 47:54.037
Now, who can tell me the grammatically
correct way to write this sentence?

47:55.831 --> 47:59.167
-Fake-ass bitches thinking they cute.

47:59.251 --> 48:02.337
Fake-ass bitches who think they're cute.

48:03.213 --> 48:07.134
Good. "Fake-ass bitches
who think they're cute." But...

48:07.801 --> 48:11.179
Hey. Are you here for class?
I guess it's never too late.

48:11.555 --> 48:12.806
Can I talk to you outside?

48:12.890 --> 48:14.266
...there.

48:14.349 --> 48:19.479
They are. They are.
T-H-E-Y-apostrophe-R-E.

48:19.563 --> 48:20.439
Good.

48:20.522 --> 48:22.774
Hey. Sorry about that.
I wasn't saying that you're old.

48:23.859 --> 48:28.071
Sometimes, my mouth and my noggin
don't work together like they should.

48:28.655 --> 48:31.199
It's almost like I have
a brain injury or some...

48:31.283 --> 48:33.327
Shit.

48:33.410 --> 48:35.913
Starting over.
It's been a while since I've seen you.

48:35.996 --> 48:38.248
Maybe because I've been in the SHU
for a very long time.

48:40.083 --> 48:41.752
In my defense,
you told me not to come visit.

48:41.835 --> 48:43.462
I know you're smuggling phones.

48:45.088 --> 48:46.465
I need you to get me one.

48:46.548 --> 48:49.927
Damn. And here I thought
you were all straight angles and shit.

48:51.845 --> 48:52.930
You gonna get me a phone or no?

48:54.306 --> 48:55.307
Totes.

48:56.433 --> 48:59.770
Yeah, uh... Hey, and since it's you,
I can get you a killer discount.

48:59.853 --> 49:01.313
How's 500 bucks sound?

49:01.396 --> 49:03.941
You're right.
It is like you have a brain injury.

49:05.776 --> 49:08.528
Or free. Free's good.

49:09.237 --> 49:12.574
I need one with Internet.
None of that flip phone bullshit.

49:14.660 --> 49:16.578
<i>Hola.</i>
<i>Gloria.</i>

49:16.662 --> 49:18.372
Mom, blessings.

49:18.455 --> 49:21.833
<i>And God bless you, too.</i>
I took the day off tomorrow
so I can pick them up at the airport.

49:25.379 --> 49:28.340
Gloria, I don't know
how to tell you this, but...

49:29.716 --> 49:31.551
the girls have decided
they don't want to go. What's wrong?
Are they nervous about flying?

49:34.304 --> 49:38.642
I'm sure they're scared
about making new friends.

49:39.768 --> 49:41.603
-I know it's a big change.
<i>No...</i>

49:41.687 --> 49:42.896
It's more than that.

49:42.980 --> 49:44.773
Okay, let me talk to Ceci.

49:48.735 --> 49:54.157
If you're big enough to decide this,
you're big enough to tell her yourself.

49:59.746 --> 50:00.580
Hello.

50:01.248 --> 50:04.084
Ceci

50:04.793 --> 50:09.172
You're gonna love it here, I promise.
You don't need to be afraid.

50:09.256 --> 50:10.590
I'm not.

50:10.674 --> 50:12.968
Then what's this about

50:14.386 --> 50:16.847
I know it took me longer
than I said it would.

50:16.930 --> 50:20.767
But everything's going to be okay.

50:21.435 --> 50:23.979
And I can't wait for you and Ellie
to meet your little brother.

50:24.062 --> 50:25.897
We're not coming, Gloria.

50:27.649 --> 50:30.110
Yes, you are, Ceci.

50:30.736 --> 50:33.613
You don't get to decide. I'm your mother.

50:33.697 --> 50:35.490
-<i>Since forever.</i>

50:35.574 --> 50:38.952
Everything I've done here,
I've done for you.

50:40.495 --> 50:43.415
I had to leave you
to give you opportunities.

50:44.082 --> 50:45.250
<i>-And now--</i>
-No.

50:45.333 --> 50:47.878
You didn't have to leave.
That was your choice.

50:47.961 --> 50:50.756
And this is mine and Elena's.

50:50.839 --> 50:52.132
We're not coming.

51:01.558 --> 51:04.227
Closing time, ladies.
We made it through another one.

51:05.020 --> 51:06.855
I'm two boxes ahead of schedule.

51:09.524 --> 51:10.901
Why are all my pens in the trash?

51:10.984 --> 51:12.861
I threw away the ones that didn't work.

51:12.944 --> 51:14.488
Did you check them first?

51:15.113 --> 51:17.074
That's how I know they didn't work.

51:17.783 --> 51:19.576
When something doesn't work,
you throw it out.

51:19.659 --> 51:21.161
You can't just throw away half my pens.

51:21.745 --> 51:26.416
I can't? I can't throw away a 29-cent pen
that doesn't work?

51:27.876 --> 51:31.171
I am so tired of people telling me
what I can't do.

51:31.797 --> 51:35.050
I can't talk about my real life.
I can't have a drink.

51:35.133 --> 51:38.512
I can't go into a bar
and watch other people have a drink.

51:38.595 --> 51:41.181
I can't be out past 11:00.

51:41.264 --> 51:45.685
Apparently, I can't be around babies
I'm not related to at any time of day.

51:45.769 --> 51:47.646
-I can't listen to music.
-Piper, you're making a scene.

51:47.729 --> 51:49.773
I can't make a scene. What can I do?

51:49.856 --> 51:51.525
Calm down. Don't get mad.

51:51.608 --> 51:54.111
I can't get mad at Alex.
I can't get mad at you.

51:54.194 --> 51:58.156
I can't be late to pee in a cup
or else they will lock me up again.

51:59.574 --> 52:04.412
Don't worry. It's 5:02 p.m.
I'm not leaving a second early.

52:04.496 --> 52:05.789
I knew it was rehab.

52:12.212 --> 52:14.673
Hey, kiddo. You feeling better?

52:14.756 --> 52:16.842
We missed you
at the ICE Capades yesterday.

52:17.300 --> 52:22.264
Yeah, yeah. It was just a little headache.
I'm fine. Come here.

52:28.645 --> 52:29.938
Can you believe it?

52:30.522 --> 52:33.441
Little Sterling's coming home
from the NICU today.

52:33.775 --> 52:36.444
This is terrific. Congratulations.

52:37.112 --> 52:40.323
You know, the next thing you know,
he's gonna be an oily teenager

52:40.407 --> 52:43.535
and you are gonna be washing
his little spooge socks.

52:45.912 --> 52:50.625
I'm making an Instagram for him,
you know, now that all the tubes is out.

52:50.709 --> 52:53.044
What do you think
I should caption this one as?

52:53.587 --> 52:54.588
Uh...

52:55.380 --> 52:57.465
"Rocka-buh-bye, baby bitches!"

52:58.884 --> 53:02.429
"Peace out, milk drinkers.
See you in the comments."

53:03.513 --> 53:05.098
And there's a hashtag before those?

53:05.182 --> 53:06.433
-There's always a hashtag.
-Okay.

53:06.516 --> 53:07.809
You gotta hashtag.

53:08.685 --> 53:11.897
This might surprise you,
but I used to have a lot of anger.

53:12.814 --> 53:16.735
And then I had a near-death experience.
Beth.

53:16.818 --> 53:19.362
It doesn't matter
if it was spiritual or man-made.

53:19.446 --> 53:24.826
It made me realize that fucked-up things
could lead to fun kickball games,

53:24.910 --> 53:28.163
where no one gets killed
if you just try to be a good person.

53:28.997 --> 53:32.167
-Thank you for sharing.
So I'm really glad that I'm here.

53:32.500 --> 53:34.502
And not just because
of the extra yard time.

53:35.212 --> 53:39.841
I mean, I'm not sure
if this class will do anything for me,

53:40.675 --> 53:43.470
but I read in this one pamphlet, um,

53:44.596 --> 53:47.057
"You can take what you want
and leave the rest."

53:47.140 --> 53:49.643
Kind of like shoplifting, but for good.

53:50.644 --> 53:52.520
I think this class could do something

53:52.604 --> 53:55.357
for anyone who's willing
to show up for herself.

53:58.068 --> 53:59.069
Please.

54:00.278 --> 54:06.117
Now, let's take turns. We'll take turns
reading from the next chapter.

54:06.201 --> 54:08.036
And I'll start us off.

54:14.251 --> 54:15.252
"What is crime?

54:17.170 --> 54:19.464
<i>We create rules to guide our behavior</i>

54:19.547 --> 54:22.175
<i>so we can live peaceably</i>
<i>around other people.</i>

54:27.722 --> 54:31.393
<i>But sometimes,</i>
<i>our lives press up against the rules.</i>

54:33.311 --> 54:35.939
<i>The rules seem arbitrary and confining.</i>

54:39.734 --> 54:41.736
<i>Sometimes, we come to a place of conflict</i>

54:41.820 --> 54:46.574
<i>between our inner emotional reality</i>
<i>and what society demands of us.</i>

55:03.258 --> 55:08.680
<i>We act in ways that damage ourselves</i>
<i>or other people or their property.</i>

55:11.516 --> 55:13.768
<i>Crime is a breaking point.</i>

55:14.894 --> 55:18.440
<i>Sometimes, we're on one side of it</i>
<i>as a victim.</i>

55:18.523 --> 55:20.734
<i>Sometimes, we're on the other</i>
<i>as an offender.</i>

55:21.901 --> 55:24.779
<i>Justice is about repairing that break.</i>

55:25.322 --> 55:28.033
