00:00.315 --> 00:02.069
My name is Stephen Jameson.

00:02.101 --> 00:03.876
I'm one of the Tomorrow People.

00:03.908 --> 00:06.134
They call our powers the three T's.

00:06.145 --> 00:07.398
- Telepathy...
- Stephen?

00:07.436 --> 00:08.437
Telekinesis...

00:08.468 --> 00:09.895
And teleportation.

00:10.015 --> 00:13.166
There is a shadow war going
on between us and Ultra...

00:13.179 --> 00:15.400
- No!
- ... the secret organization that hunts us.

00:15.437 --> 00:17.984
The only way to keep my
species from going extinct

00:18.028 --> 00:19.567
is to find my father.

00:19.617 --> 00:22.801
And the only way to do that
is by working for the enemy.

00:23.727 --> 00:25.470
Previously on The Tomorrow People...

00:26.975 --> 00:29.335
Julian is a nihilist.

00:29.337 --> 00:30.353
An anarchist.

00:30.355 --> 00:31.638
You know this guy?

00:31.640 --> 00:33.289
Our paths crossed when
I first got into town.

00:33.291 --> 00:35.225
We didn't part on the best terms.

00:35.810 --> 00:37.176
We do not torture people.

00:37.178 --> 00:38.645
I'm not going anywhere.

00:39.196 --> 00:40.864
New York is mine, bitch.

00:45.268 --> 00:47.787
You overrode my leadership
in front of everyone.

00:47.815 --> 00:50.540
I am gonna do what I think
is best for our people.

00:50.660 --> 00:53.326
This attitude of yours is
dangerous for all of us.

00:53.333 --> 00:57.747
If you're gonna threaten to kick me
out every time I step out of line,

00:57.749 --> 00:59.215
you should just do it already.

00:59.217 --> 01:01.701
Pack your stuff. You need to go.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:16.984 --> 01:18.184
Sir!

01:38.011 --> 01:41.174
- He's down. He's down. You all right?
- Clear!

01:51.218 --> 01:52.886
Made you some breakfast.

01:53.206 --> 01:54.971
Oh, thanks sweetheart.

01:56.023 --> 01:58.308
Can't a guy make breakfast for another guy?

01:58.643 --> 02:01.060
I figure I got to earn my
keep around here somehow.

02:01.062 --> 02:02.278
Mmm-hmm.

02:03.185 --> 02:05.064
Damn. That's really good.

02:05.066 --> 02:06.282
It's the bread.

02:06.284 --> 02:08.785
You gotta let it go stale
to make French toast.

02:08.816 --> 02:10.523
Saw it on a TV show.

02:10.973 --> 02:13.960
Well, as nice as it is to see you
tapping into your domestic side,

02:14.341 --> 02:16.963
you're avoiding dealing with Cara.
You can't live like this forever.

02:16.965 --> 02:19.299
Look, if I'm in the way, just say the word.

02:19.301 --> 02:20.550
It's not that.

02:20.552 --> 02:22.085
Our people need you.

02:22.117 --> 02:24.304
Maybe they're better off without me.

02:24.670 --> 02:26.089
Cara kicked me out, remember?

02:26.091 --> 02:27.974
And then she asked you to
come back, and you said no.

02:27.976 --> 02:29.400
You want to know what I think?

02:29.418 --> 02:30.642
- Not especially.
- Too bad.

02:30.688 --> 02:32.896
You're both being too
stubborn to just let it go.

02:32.898 --> 02:34.180
Face each other.

02:34.182 --> 02:36.150
Look, you're welcome to stay
here as long as you want.

02:36.151 --> 02:37.216
But you belong with them.

02:37.218 --> 02:38.401
And with Cara.

02:40.437 --> 02:43.765
I don't mean, like, "With Cara."

02:44.003 --> 02:45.057
With Cara, I just meant...

02:45.059 --> 02:46.109
I know what you meant.

02:46.111 --> 02:47.610
Cook her some breakfast.

02:47.612 --> 02:49.496
Your French toast is ridiculous.

02:56.921 --> 02:58.087
Hmmph.

03:05.513 --> 03:07.180
Are you there, John?

03:07.848 --> 03:09.048
Are you busy?

03:09.517 --> 03:10.967
Hardly.

03:12.386 --> 03:14.767
So how is everything?

03:15.161 --> 03:17.440
- Good, I suppose.

03:18.592 --> 03:20.560
But you're probably
asking about Cara, right?

03:20.562 --> 03:22.145
No, I was not.

03:22.863 --> 03:24.614
But since you brought her up.

03:25.065 --> 03:26.232
How is she?

03:26.234 --> 03:27.984
She's not the same without you.

03:27.986 --> 03:30.069
This whole place isn't the same.

03:30.771 --> 03:31.921
So when are you coming back?

03:31.923 --> 03:33.573
I don't know yet, Charlotte.

03:33.923 --> 03:36.442
If you don't come back soon,
I'm going to hate you forever.

03:37.928 --> 03:39.712
I miss you too, Charlie.

03:40.881 --> 03:42.248
Who you talking to?

03:42.917 --> 03:44.100
No one.

03:44.952 --> 03:46.586
So how is John, anyway?

03:48.155 --> 03:49.505
It's okay.

03:49.957 --> 03:51.174
I miss him too.

03:51.176 --> 03:53.042
Then why don't you let him come back home?

03:53.044 --> 03:56.429
Charlotte, I can't force him to come
back if he wants to be on his own.

03:56.431 --> 03:57.647
Why not?

03:58.799 --> 04:00.149
You're in charge, right?

04:00.151 --> 04:02.435
It doesn't work that way down here.

04:03.854 --> 04:06.406
You can't bring someone
in unless they're ready.

04:59.936 --> 05:02.194
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

05:04.798 --> 05:06.666
I believe this belongs to me.

05:08.302 --> 05:11.170
And what do you need a
cell phone for, anyway?

05:11.639 --> 05:12.839
You're telepathic.

05:12.841 --> 05:14.223
Cara.

05:15.225 --> 05:17.310
- How do you know my name?
- I read your mind.

05:17.312 --> 05:18.478
You're crazy.

05:22.900 --> 05:25.234
You need to listen to me very carefully.

05:25.938 --> 05:28.855
There is a place for people
like us where you'll be safe.

05:28.857 --> 05:31.107
Off the streets, and away from Ultra.

05:32.526 --> 05:34.027
So you've heard of them.

05:34.394 --> 05:35.611
Good.

05:35.943 --> 05:37.730
How do I know I can trust you?

05:46.040 --> 05:47.457
What's up?

05:48.644 --> 05:52.378
Um, what's up is you haven't
been in school in a week.

05:53.263 --> 05:54.597
Told you, I'm sick.

05:54.599 --> 05:55.557
You did.

05:56.027 --> 05:57.415
You look all right to me.

05:57.447 --> 05:59.218
Oh. What, are you a doctor now?

05:59.461 --> 06:00.894
Working for your

06:01.170 --> 06:02.659
crazy uncle?

06:03.529 --> 06:05.274
Okay, so that's what this is about.

06:05.276 --> 06:07.643
I fixed things with my uncle.

06:08.133 --> 06:09.973
No one will ever come after you.

06:10.093 --> 06:10.993
I promise.

06:11.030 --> 06:13.621
Sorry, I'm probably contagious,
I think you should go.

06:24.545 --> 06:27.113
Oh, Julian, Julian, Julian.

06:30.450 --> 06:32.468
I wish I could say I was surprised.

06:33.120 --> 06:35.176
But, then again...

06:35.208 --> 06:37.840
All roads lead to Ultra
for your sort, don't they?

06:38.242 --> 06:41.274
I have to tell you, when I heard
you just popped in for a visit,

06:41.583 --> 06:44.510
at the most paranormally
secure building on the planet,

06:44.968 --> 06:47.313
I thought it was a little
bit too good to be true.

06:48.449 --> 06:50.116
But then again, here you are.

06:50.354 --> 06:51.918
Put down the damn needle.

06:51.943 --> 06:52.852
Why?

06:54.121 --> 06:56.289
You must suspect I got caught for a reason?

06:56.291 --> 06:58.741
I don't have time for games. I got nothing.

07:00.828 --> 07:02.128
I lost my crew.

07:02.546 --> 07:04.080
I lost my girl.

07:05.299 --> 07:07.050
This is no way to live.

07:07.327 --> 07:09.082
Being hunted like an animal.

07:09.202 --> 07:10.219
Go news.

07:10.221 --> 07:12.672
I take away your powers,
Ultra leaves you alone.

07:12.894 --> 07:15.785
You take away my powers, you're
giving up your white whale.

07:17.177 --> 07:18.561
Cara Coburn?

07:20.640 --> 07:24.100
Her ragged group of rebels
living right beneath your feet?

07:24.685 --> 07:26.052
I can deliver them to you.

07:28.322 --> 07:30.144
If you'd rather give me the needle,

07:30.607 --> 07:32.021
let's get it over with.

07:38.056 --> 07:43.575
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

07:54.049 --> 07:56.545
We've got fresh food for three days.

07:56.583 --> 07:58.059
Canned goods to last us a week.

07:58.091 --> 08:00.105
Plus, we're running
low on medical supplies.

08:00.225 --> 08:03.965
Plus, we're out of the totally important
stuff like beer and gummy bears.

08:04.085 --> 08:05.400
I'm not talking about
that supermarket crap,

08:05.402 --> 08:08.001
I mean the good German ones. Der Gummi.

08:08.014 --> 08:10.372
Grab some people. We'll go
topside tonight for provisions.

08:10.374 --> 08:11.957
Can I come with you?

08:12.491 --> 08:13.625
I want to help.

08:13.627 --> 08:15.043
Not this time, honey.

08:15.163 --> 08:17.829
We need you to hold down
the fort until we get back.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.637
- What's going on?
- Taking inventory.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.222
If you want to help out,
we could use the muscle.

08:27.224 --> 08:28.706
Someone's got to carry the keg.

08:28.708 --> 08:31.309
You know, it sounds like
you got it under control.

08:31.761 --> 08:33.044
Truth.

08:33.046 --> 08:35.145
You have this place spinning like a top.

08:35.648 --> 08:37.164
I came here with news.

08:37.549 --> 08:38.600
About Julian.

08:39.602 --> 08:42.009
Please, tell me he

08:42.129 --> 08:44.085
died tasting his own blood.

08:44.086 --> 08:46.324
Actually, he's at Ultra.

08:47.693 --> 08:49.494
I figured he fled the city.

08:49.935 --> 08:52.119
No one deserves the needle
more than that sick bastard.

08:52.150 --> 08:54.653
So, you're telling me when
I run into him on the street,

08:54.678 --> 08:56.036
he won't have powers?

08:57.174 --> 09:00.405
Should make our grudge
match a whole lot of fun.

09:00.597 --> 09:03.241
- Still jonesing for revenge, huh?
- You blame him?

09:03.669 --> 09:05.302
Russell's got reason to hate Julian.

09:05.521 --> 09:07.242
Almost as bad as he hates me.

09:07.254 --> 09:08.930
Well, you don't have to
worry about that anymore.

09:10.132 --> 09:11.383
Yeah.

09:12.268 --> 09:13.935
Thanks for the news.

09:21.677 --> 09:23.528
What are they doing here?

09:24.072 --> 09:26.125
I assume you're not gonna take my powers.

09:26.193 --> 09:27.598
Well, you assume correctly.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.568
Then why am I still strapped down, when
I could be finding the Tomorrow People?

09:31.342 --> 09:32.400
Well,

09:33.438 --> 09:35.303
let's just say I don't want
to let you out of custody

09:35.334 --> 09:38.512
until I have an assurance that you're
going to deliver on your promise.

09:38.544 --> 09:41.746
Give me four men, and I'll bring you the
whole gang tied up in a neat little bow.

09:41.748 --> 09:45.166
And why should you succeed when
my best Ultra agents have failed?

09:47.470 --> 09:48.455
Because of that

09:48.517 --> 09:51.101
shifty little minx who's calling the shots.

09:52.508 --> 09:53.958
Cara.

09:54.430 --> 09:57.662
I taught her everything she knows
about surviving in this city.

09:58.246 --> 10:00.036
How to hide in plain sight.

10:00.055 --> 10:02.232
When and where to find supplies.

10:02.301 --> 10:04.128
If anybody can find her,

10:04.334 --> 10:05.435
it's me.

10:06.505 --> 10:08.106
How's that for an assurance?

10:08.226 --> 10:08.908
Hmm.

10:09.028 --> 10:10.672
Yeah, I'm not feeling it.

10:15.481 --> 10:16.665
Ahh!

10:19.972 --> 10:23.244
What I've just injected into
your sinus is an explosive charge.

10:23.364 --> 10:25.722
It's not huge, but it'll kill you.

10:25.734 --> 10:28.093
- I thought we had a deal.
- Oh, we do.

10:28.368 --> 10:30.345
I'm just making sure it
works out in my favor.

10:30.730 --> 10:31.930
So...

10:33.165 --> 10:35.795
That's going to go off in
18 hours unless I desarm it.

10:35.971 --> 10:38.235
What you do with that time
is of course up to you,

10:38.254 --> 10:40.394
but if you don't bring
Cara and her friends in...

10:41.738 --> 10:45.443
well, let's just say you won't have
to worry about that headache anymore.

11:14.924 --> 11:17.369
Aren't you supposed to be in school?

11:19.044 --> 11:21.563
Aren't you supposed to
be in your secret lair?

11:22.857 --> 11:24.408
Wearing clothes?

11:24.984 --> 11:27.485
Really though, why are
you in Stephen's room?

11:27.543 --> 11:29.514
Oh, just crashing for a bit.

11:29.989 --> 11:31.766
I just needed a break, that's all.

11:31.886 --> 11:33.724
Yeah, I know the feeling.

11:34.894 --> 11:36.478
Is that why you're skipping school?

11:36.480 --> 11:38.317
I was actually hoping to talk to Stephen.

11:38.349 --> 11:39.697
Well, you got me.

11:39.699 --> 11:40.865
You want to talk?

11:40.867 --> 11:43.284
Why are you suddenly so
interested in my life?

11:43.629 --> 11:45.437
Well, you did pull a bullet out of me.

11:46.005 --> 11:47.802
- A break from what?
- Hmm?

11:47.827 --> 11:49.958
The reason you're hiding out in
Stephen's room, you said you needed...

11:49.960 --> 11:52.127
Hey, no, we're talking about you now.

11:52.129 --> 11:54.579
You want, uh, you want to
meet up at the noodle bar?

11:54.581 --> 11:55.847
Well...

11:55.849 --> 11:57.617
That's kind of the problem.

11:57.649 --> 12:00.128
I'm having a hard time
getting out of the house.

12:00.636 --> 12:02.253
I'll come to you then.

12:06.809 --> 12:09.027
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:10.529 --> 12:12.063
Nice house.

12:13.115 --> 12:14.449
Thanks.

12:16.984 --> 12:18.617
So, what's going on?

12:19.405 --> 12:20.955
Uh...

12:21.440 --> 12:22.674
Stuff.

12:23.042 --> 12:24.818
Stuff. Hmm.

12:25.694 --> 12:26.961
Come on.

12:36.288 --> 12:37.806
I don't know, I'm...

12:39.125 --> 12:40.642
not really sleeping.

12:41.393 --> 12:42.677
Can't eat.

12:43.018 --> 12:45.330
Haven't left the house
since I got back to town.

12:45.332 --> 12:46.614
That makes sense.

12:47.248 --> 12:49.184
You were targeted by a hit squad.

12:49.451 --> 12:50.785
Twice.

12:51.189 --> 12:53.554
I mean, most people would
be total basket cases.

12:53.623 --> 12:54.980
Check.

12:55.412 --> 12:57.664
But you can't wear slippers
the rest of your life.

12:58.247 --> 12:59.631
I like these slippers.

12:59.633 --> 13:01.732
They're nice slippers,
but it's not what I meant.

13:04.086 --> 13:05.537
Truth is...

13:06.405 --> 13:08.495
I'm scared of being around Stephen.

13:09.108 --> 13:10.829
I know it's not his fault.

13:10.860 --> 13:12.243
But now that I've seen those things...

13:12.249 --> 13:13.962
You can't unsee them.

13:15.534 --> 13:17.624
And now you're wondering how you

13:17.643 --> 13:19.050
even leave the house,

13:19.094 --> 13:21.352
knowing you could be in
the line of fire again.

13:22.022 --> 13:24.512
You know, I ask myself
the same thing every day.

13:24.756 --> 13:26.357
Hmm.

13:26.821 --> 13:28.848
And what do you have to be scared of?

13:29.728 --> 13:31.558
Anything bad comes along,

13:31.570 --> 13:32.965
you can teleport out.

13:33.866 --> 13:35.450
People like me,

13:35.781 --> 13:38.903
we die in car crashes and
we get struck by lightning.

13:39.938 --> 13:42.240
We can't run away from
the bad things out there.

13:42.707 --> 13:44.402
But, you take a leap of faith

13:44.446 --> 13:45.967
and you keep going anyway.

13:46.962 --> 13:48.630
And maybe I can help.

13:50.132 --> 13:51.332
How?

13:51.334 --> 13:52.783
First things first.

13:53.502 --> 13:55.170
We find you some shoes.

14:02.294 --> 14:03.561
Come on.

14:05.658 --> 14:08.173
I take it you've been
on your own for a while.

14:08.293 --> 14:10.401
Had a stint of living with others like us.

14:11.445 --> 14:14.298
Didn't exactly pan out, so I
figure better to rely on myself.

14:14.773 --> 14:16.608
I get that.

14:18.027 --> 14:20.078
But if I can find you,

14:20.080 --> 14:21.779
Ultra can find you.

14:22.407 --> 14:24.616
We stand a better chance
of surviving together,

14:24.618 --> 14:25.950
then we do apart.

14:25.952 --> 14:27.418
Oh.

14:27.420 --> 14:29.003
And you want to help me.

14:29.285 --> 14:31.923
Poor little damsel in distress,
out of the goodness of your heart.

14:32.476 --> 14:34.592
You're the best telepath I've ever met.

14:34.594 --> 14:36.327
You can help us find others.

14:36.329 --> 14:37.879
So you want to use me?

14:38.320 --> 14:41.048
Maybe I'm not explaining myself right.

14:41.168 --> 14:44.001
Is that why you won't let
me inside your head, John?

14:44.452 --> 14:46.541
Don't want me to figure
out it's all a trap?

14:51.064 --> 14:53.649
Next time you want to recruit
a sweet, young telepath,

14:53.769 --> 14:56.114
don't corner her in an empty subway car.

15:14.800 --> 15:15.850
Excuse me.

15:16.132 --> 15:17.863
What happened to the guy
that was in this room?

15:17.872 --> 15:19.220
He's already out in the field.

15:19.222 --> 15:22.302
Took agents out with him to go
after a group of paranormals.

15:29.239 --> 15:31.240
Right, now, remember, Tim's
taking care of security,

15:31.241 --> 15:33.902
but any sign of trouble, you drop
everything, we rendezvous back at the lair.

15:34.151 --> 15:36.979
Seriously, if I don't get my gummy
bears, I'm going to kill someone.

15:37.099 --> 15:38.393
All right, let's get moving.

15:43.228 --> 15:45.113
So many cold cuts,

15:45.115 --> 15:46.831
so little time.

16:13.309 --> 16:14.842
Hello, Cara.

16:22.330 --> 16:24.466
Figured you'd drag your rats here to refuel

16:24.467 --> 16:26.094
since I taught you about this place.

16:26.820 --> 16:29.041
Easy in. Easy out.

16:29.371 --> 16:31.769
You always were a creature of habit.

16:33.041 --> 16:35.392
Go on. Juice her.

16:38.362 --> 16:40.398
Come on, Cara.

16:40.799 --> 16:42.475
I know you're still here.

16:42.707 --> 16:44.264
You wouldn't want to leave your poor,

16:44.308 --> 16:46.911
defenseless little friends alone with me.

16:47.756 --> 16:50.446
Russell, Ultra's here.

16:50.708 --> 16:52.307
Why aren't you answering me?

16:52.427 --> 16:53.727
Russell!

16:59.434 --> 17:00.717
Stephen.

17:01.886 --> 17:03.981
- We were ambushed.
- It's Julian.

17:04.025 --> 17:05.332
He's working with Ultra.

17:05.869 --> 17:07.866
If Julian is here,

17:07.929 --> 17:09.199
let's roll the son of a bitch.

17:09.230 --> 17:11.926
Hey. Free the others and get
out of here, I gotta find Cara.

17:11.944 --> 17:13.384
- But...
- I know, I know.

17:13.564 --> 17:14.698
Revenge can wait, Russell.

17:25.676 --> 17:27.243
I'm not in the mood for hide and seek.

17:38.959 --> 17:40.794
Why postpone the inevitable?

17:46.601 --> 17:48.082
We gotta get out of here.

17:48.391 --> 17:49.942
Everybody cool to teleport?

18:13.444 --> 18:14.694
You okay?

18:18.479 --> 18:19.724
What are you doing here?

18:19.749 --> 18:21.288
I'm an Ultra agent, remember?

18:21.408 --> 18:23.178
Got a call you needed backup.

18:25.005 --> 18:26.089
Fine.

18:26.431 --> 18:27.907
Help load the prisoners.

18:37.655 --> 18:39.670
My uncle's not gonna like that.

18:48.492 --> 18:51.777
Okay, look. If this is some
kind of exposure therapy,

18:51.821 --> 18:52.615
I get it.

18:53.451 --> 18:55.318
Public transportation is terrifying.

18:55.953 --> 18:58.271
Not nearly terrifying enough.

19:03.483 --> 19:04.965
John, what are you doing?

19:05.009 --> 19:06.492
Proving a point.

19:06.831 --> 19:09.013
Fear doesn't have to own you.

19:09.032 --> 19:11.504
Fear is something you can control.

19:12.392 --> 19:13.731
I don't want to die.

19:13.781 --> 19:15.305
Everyone dies, Astrid.

19:16.790 --> 19:20.688
All you can do is make sure you're
wearing the right shoes when it happens.

19:22.070 --> 19:23.960
Do you trust me?

19:37.982 --> 19:39.565
I know you're scared.

19:40.441 --> 19:41.936
I'm scared too.

19:42.831 --> 19:44.250
But I'm right here.

19:51.648 --> 19:52.926
Count of three.

19:55.439 --> 19:56.428
One.

20:07.146 --> 20:08.360
We're still alive.

20:08.391 --> 20:09.661
Yeah, we are.

20:15.412 --> 20:16.449
Thank you.

20:20.149 --> 20:22.877
Uh, well you are certainly very good at

20:22.883 --> 20:24.716
dealing with life and death issues.

20:27.407 --> 20:30.347
Look, I don't know why
you're avoiding the lair.

20:30.416 --> 20:32.718
But maybe you should

20:32.838 --> 20:34.765
face your fear. And...

20:35.597 --> 20:37.543
take your own leap of faith.

20:40.323 --> 20:42.663
How the hell did Julian
know where we were gonna be?

20:42.694 --> 20:44.384
Our grocery grab.

20:44.962 --> 20:47.561
I was borrowing a page
from Julian's playbook.

20:47.848 --> 20:50.339
And now he's working for Ultra. Wow.

20:50.459 --> 20:52.310
Must have figured he could join forces.

20:57.741 --> 20:59.669
Tim, where is that?

20:59.688 --> 21:01.346
That's Stephen's neighborhood.

21:01.396 --> 21:03.148
Charlotte asked me to locate it for her.

21:03.268 --> 21:05.064
I do hope I haven't overstepped.

21:05.565 --> 21:07.090
Where is she now, Tim?

21:07.210 --> 21:08.754
Looking for John.

21:20.426 --> 21:21.853
John?

21:23.598 --> 21:24.956
Can you hear me?

21:36.864 --> 21:38.223
What's that?

21:38.432 --> 21:39.737
Probably nothing.

21:39.762 --> 21:41.739
It's a paranormal blip.
We get them all the time.

21:41.859 --> 21:44.861
Or one of Cara's rats who
got lost on their way home?

21:46.243 --> 21:47.624
I say we check it out.

21:48.208 --> 21:49.490
Cool with that, Stephen?

21:50.628 --> 21:52.278
Of course.

22:04.842 --> 22:06.225
Get out.

22:08.480 --> 22:10.182
What the hell are you doing?

22:10.302 --> 22:12.478
Whatever happened back there at the store,

22:12.598 --> 22:13.841
I don't like it.

22:14.079 --> 22:16.037
And as long as I got a bomb in my brain,

22:16.157 --> 22:17.520
I'm only going to trust me.

22:17.846 --> 22:19.060
Sorry.

22:25.746 --> 22:27.480
John.

22:28.916 --> 22:31.010
John, Julian's on his way to my house,

22:31.011 --> 22:32.638
you got to get out of there.

22:32.901 --> 22:33.836
Julian?

22:34.240 --> 22:35.886
Stephen, I'm not at your house.

22:36.474 --> 22:38.176
Then Julian is...

22:46.166 --> 22:47.633
John!

22:50.119 --> 22:51.908
Long time no see, little one.

22:52.934 --> 22:55.084
- Come here!
-  Stop!

23:11.237 --> 23:12.426
What happened?

23:12.463 --> 23:14.396
I found you on the street.

23:14.446 --> 23:16.261
Not far from where I found this.

23:19.126 --> 23:20.459
Charlotte.

23:20.528 --> 23:22.061
Why didn't you tell me Julian was back?

23:22.181 --> 23:24.632
I thought they were going to
strip Julian of his powers.

23:24.676 --> 23:26.491
I gotta get to Ultra.

23:26.493 --> 23:28.493
- Good luck.
- Where are you going?

23:29.030 --> 23:31.163
Where I should have been all along.

23:50.580 --> 23:53.534
- You had my clearance revoked.
- Don't take it personally.

23:53.558 --> 23:56.387
We will reactivate you just as
soon as the operation's over.

23:56.412 --> 23:59.509
He used to be the enemy. He's got
a little girl handcuffed in there.

23:59.629 --> 24:02.244
So, you're just gonna
let him terrorize her?

24:03.381 --> 24:06.547
Charlotte is unfortunately
no stranger to our process.

24:06.667 --> 24:08.412
How can you put more faith

24:08.424 --> 24:11.265
into some deranged psychopath, than in me?

24:11.571 --> 24:15.200
I put a timed explosive device
in Julian's head that I control.

24:15.381 --> 24:16.889
That makes him inclined to do what

24:16.908 --> 24:18.365
I want him to do.

24:18.397 --> 24:20.905
You don't have an explosive
device in your head, Stephen.

24:21.081 --> 24:24.516
And furthermore, you're compromised
by your feelings for Cara.

24:24.903 --> 24:27.637
I'm sorry. You fell in
love with the wrong girl,

24:27.757 --> 24:29.158
a militant paranormal.

24:29.195 --> 24:31.886
And that's why Julian has
the mission and you don't.

24:57.394 --> 24:59.784
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.

25:04.114 --> 25:06.424
Welcome back, buddy.

25:10.675 --> 25:12.681
- Charlotte's missing.
- I know.

25:12.715 --> 25:14.489
She's been taken by Julian.

25:14.711 --> 25:15.781
That's why I'm back.

25:15.831 --> 25:17.324
She came looking for me. It's my fault.

25:17.339 --> 25:18.277
Ultra's got her.

25:18.302 --> 25:19.416
Then it's only a matter of time

25:19.441 --> 25:21.662
before they get inside her head
and get everything they need.

25:35.678 --> 25:37.629
Can we at least talk about this?

25:37.631 --> 25:39.181
Sure, let's talk.

25:39.183 --> 25:40.682
Are you just here to get your gun?

25:40.707 --> 25:43.091
To say your goodbyes before
you go get yourself killed?

25:43.504 --> 25:46.288
And to say that I'm sorry for the
way things are between us right now.

25:46.313 --> 25:49.011
You are just gonna do the
exact same thing, aren't you?

25:49.461 --> 25:51.463
Would it even matter if
I asked you not to go?

25:51.507 --> 25:52.564
No.

25:52.566 --> 25:54.385
So nothing's changed.

25:54.934 --> 25:56.351
Nothing's changed.

25:58.037 --> 25:59.354
I still love you.

26:04.144 --> 26:05.611
So this is goodbye.

26:06.522 --> 26:09.248
What is your plan, you're gonna shoot
your way into Ultra to save Charlotte?

26:09.250 --> 26:10.927
John, it is suicide.

26:12.752 --> 26:13.936
I have to do this.

26:31.639 --> 26:33.810
Two against one? How is that fair?

26:42.532 --> 26:44.763
Should have stayed in hiding, John.

26:45.535 --> 26:46.735
Ahhh!

26:51.499 --> 26:52.494
We gotta get out of here.

26:52.500 --> 26:53.420
Why are you doing this?

26:53.432 --> 26:55.147
I told you, we take care of each other.

27:11.144 --> 27:12.728
All right, that's enough.

27:15.765 --> 27:17.599
Just wrapping up, actually.

27:18.685 --> 27:19.985
Don't worry.

27:20.264 --> 27:22.104
I got everything I needed.

27:24.490 --> 27:26.942
You know where the
Tomorrow People are hiding?

27:29.279 --> 27:30.829
Yes.

27:33.416 --> 27:35.649
And I'll gladly share
that location with you

27:35.661 --> 27:37.820
as soon as you take
this bomb out of my head.

27:39.923 --> 27:40.867
No,

27:41.411 --> 27:42.775
I didn't think so.

27:43.760 --> 27:45.440
Time's ticking, Julian.

27:45.560 --> 27:47.323
You want me to give up
my only bargaining chip

27:47.348 --> 27:49.613
with no guarantee that
you'll actually spare me.

27:51.866 --> 27:52.973
No, thanks.

27:53.093 --> 27:54.643
Think I'll stick to our original deal.

27:54.662 --> 27:55.787
Good.

27:56.345 --> 27:58.960
In that case, a fresh team of
agents will be at your disposal.

27:59.016 --> 28:00.208
No agents.

28:00.727 --> 28:02.445
I want a kill squad.

28:03.596 --> 28:05.631
In case they give me any trouble.

28:20.137 --> 28:22.027
Look, Julian, I know you don't trust me...

28:22.033 --> 28:23.585
Please, come with.

28:24.417 --> 28:26.675
How could I say no to the boss' nephew?

28:33.477 --> 28:34.991
Get out of there, Cara.

28:35.029 --> 28:37.294
Julian's got a kill squad,
and he's coming for you.

28:38.848 --> 28:40.515
John, wait!

28:40.517 --> 28:42.193
You're not gonna talk me out of it, Cara.

28:42.199 --> 28:44.464
You don't understand.
Ultra knows where we are.

28:44.508 --> 28:46.448
They're coming. Now.

28:56.239 --> 28:57.877
What's the location of our kill squad?

28:57.908 --> 29:00.217
Central Manhattan. On the move, looks like.

29:00.230 --> 29:02.338
Sir? It's him. Julian.

29:05.582 --> 29:06.697
Yes.

29:06.716 --> 29:08.617
Hey, Jed. Remind me.

29:08.824 --> 29:12.037
How can you be sure that the little bomb
you stuck up my snout's gonna kill me?

29:12.039 --> 29:16.476
Well, Julian, it has the same
explosive force as a grenade, so...

29:16.596 --> 29:18.660
And, let's say...

29:19.530 --> 29:22.047
If your nephew was
standing right beside me.

29:22.049 --> 29:23.632
Stephen's there?

29:24.022 --> 29:26.288
I want an exact location
on that kill squad now.

29:27.695 --> 29:29.458
I thought you said no paranormals.

29:29.460 --> 29:30.709
I did.

29:33.744 --> 29:36.265
That's why I'm putting a
suppression cuff on him.

29:36.591 --> 29:38.384
So I can keep him close.

29:38.768 --> 29:40.602
Deal stays the same, Julian.

29:40.604 --> 29:42.304
I will uphold my half of the bargain.

29:42.306 --> 29:44.356
And I expect you to uphold yours.

29:46.693 --> 29:48.694
Your nephew's life depends on it.

29:54.058 --> 29:55.884
Must be underground.

29:58.656 --> 30:00.807
Everyone's headed to the
safe house in Far Rockaway.

30:00.813 --> 30:01.658
I want you to go with them.

30:01.671 --> 30:02.872
I'm not going anywhere.

30:02.992 --> 30:04.877
I need you at the safe house.

30:04.887 --> 30:07.162
Somebody has to be there
to keep everybody calm.

30:07.164 --> 30:08.831
They'll be fine. I'm staying.

30:10.083 --> 30:13.252
John, this is exactly why
things fell apart for us before.

30:13.670 --> 30:14.420
Why's that?

30:14.422 --> 30:15.771
Because you are so damn stubborn.

30:15.773 --> 30:16.461
I'm stubborn?

30:16.492 --> 30:17.973
You don't respect my decisions.

30:17.975 --> 30:19.374
That is not true.

30:19.670 --> 30:21.885
I am in charge down here
and I gave you an order,

30:21.897 --> 30:24.396
I want you at the safe house now,
I am not going to repeat myself.

30:24.398 --> 30:25.432
I'm not going anywhere.

30:25.433 --> 30:27.266
Damn it, John. Why are you doing this?

30:28.217 --> 30:29.875
Because after finding you,

30:29.931 --> 30:32.058
and building this place up from nothing,

30:32.096 --> 30:33.097
together,

30:33.159 --> 30:35.911
and turning it into a shelter,
and then a home for us,

30:36.238 --> 30:37.133
can't you see?

30:37.158 --> 30:38.872
This is where I belong.

30:39.254 --> 30:41.910
By your side. No matter what happens to us.

30:57.388 --> 30:58.627
Take this off my wrist,

30:58.633 --> 31:00.541
I will help you level the playing field.

31:00.567 --> 31:02.548
Shh. We're getting close.

31:13.059 --> 31:14.643
This is where we get off.

31:26.658 --> 31:28.935
And then, there were three.

31:29.055 --> 31:31.663
Everyone else has
teleported to the safe house.

31:32.476 --> 31:34.103
We're taking inventory of our arsenal.

31:34.122 --> 31:35.237
Julian will be here soon.

31:35.805 --> 31:36.805
What is all this stuff?

31:36.807 --> 31:39.802
Most of it is Roger's.
Pieces of experiments.

31:39.840 --> 31:41.654
I haven't been able to throw any of it out.

31:41.710 --> 31:43.181
Got about a dozen D chips here.

31:43.218 --> 31:45.139
Which will only suppress our powers,

31:45.183 --> 31:47.130
not the human kill squad.

31:47.250 --> 31:48.650
Here we go.

31:49.703 --> 31:52.021
That's what I'm talking about.

31:52.565 --> 31:53.860
Lock and load, Johnny.

31:53.879 --> 31:54.990
Put the guns away.

31:56.760 --> 31:58.294
I've got another plan.

32:02.599 --> 32:04.658
Try again for another positioning signal.

32:04.677 --> 32:07.219
Sir, there's been no contact in
seven minutes. They're too deep.

32:09.082 --> 32:10.389
How much time do we have left?

32:10.458 --> 32:13.111
Six minutes, 12 seconds. Would
you like me to disable the bomb?

32:13.231 --> 32:14.862
If I wanted you to disable the bomb,

32:14.862 --> 32:16.678
I would have told you to disable the bomb.

32:17.866 --> 32:19.515
Signal, give me a signal.

32:36.967 --> 32:38.867
So this is their hideout.

32:39.481 --> 32:41.533
Where is everybody?
We're running out of time.

32:43.485 --> 32:46.795
This isn't about the Tomorrow People,
Julian, this is about you and me.

32:47.644 --> 32:50.062
You can take me in to Ultra,
it's time for this to be over.

32:54.217 --> 32:56.268
I'm not here to arrest you, Cara.

32:58.388 --> 33:00.272
No one has to die here.

33:01.191 --> 33:03.531
Can you bring Nelly back from the grave?

33:04.845 --> 33:06.159
Then I beg to differ.

33:06.459 --> 33:07.746
I didn't kill her.

33:08.286 --> 33:09.882
You are so bent on revenge,

33:09.894 --> 33:11.252
you would turn against your own kind,

33:11.258 --> 33:12.471
some day that'll catch up with you.

33:12.496 --> 33:14.742
Blah, blah, blah, blah. Would
somebody shoot her already?

33:14.862 --> 33:15.802
No!

33:22.179 --> 33:23.512
I knew you were a rat.

33:23.921 --> 33:25.767
But thanks for the confirmation.

33:29.938 --> 33:31.134
Wait.

33:31.254 --> 33:32.721
She's still here.

33:34.107 --> 33:35.641
I can feel her.

33:36.759 --> 33:38.227
Poor thing.

33:38.979 --> 33:40.596
All of her friends have left her.

33:40.598 --> 33:42.615
That's not quite true.

33:45.787 --> 33:47.169
Hold your fire!

33:47.289 --> 33:49.009
He's just trying to disorient you.

33:49.129 --> 33:50.385
Oh hey, Julian.

33:50.954 --> 33:52.074
Remember me?

33:52.550 --> 33:54.283
What are you waiting for? Shoot!

33:57.447 --> 33:59.662
I thought you said hold your fire.

33:59.782 --> 34:01.525
This is getting confusing.

34:05.455 --> 34:07.256
Make up your mind, Julian!

34:07.775 --> 34:09.014
Time's running out.

34:11.254 --> 34:12.455
This way.

34:27.143 --> 34:28.976
Enough with the games, Cara.

34:29.829 --> 34:31.647
You know you can't kill me anyway.

34:32.458 --> 34:33.831
I don't have to.

34:34.083 --> 34:35.284
Now!

34:41.337 --> 34:43.483
The glass is bulletproof, Julian.

35:03.647 --> 35:04.863
Stephen?

35:05.283 --> 35:06.451
You let me out of here,

35:06.464 --> 35:08.265
I won't say anything
about this to your uncle.

35:13.389 --> 35:14.502
Hey, Julian,

35:14.502 --> 35:16.623
remember what happened when
you caught me in your house?

35:18.044 --> 35:20.012
Now, you're in my house.

35:25.289 --> 35:27.247
Mission should have been over by now.

35:35.826 --> 35:37.847
Stop the countdown.

35:40.631 --> 35:43.540
- I said stop the bomb.
- We've just lost contact with the device.

35:43.559 --> 35:45.286
It's too far underground.

36:13.383 --> 36:14.683
Cara.

36:16.191 --> 36:18.475
Don't do this, all right? I'm begging you.

36:19.689 --> 36:21.655
I made a mistake.

36:21.775 --> 36:23.429
I'm one of you.

36:26.677 --> 36:28.485
You can't do this to me!

36:29.699 --> 36:31.433
You did this to yourself.

36:34.904 --> 36:36.488
Cara!

37:00.103 --> 37:02.180
Everything all right, sir?

37:06.802 --> 37:08.136
Okay.

37:09.271 --> 37:10.805
What happened?

37:10.807 --> 37:11.990
Where's Julian?

37:11.992 --> 37:14.492
I was just about to ask you the same thing.

37:14.811 --> 37:16.945
The minute I got on the
train, he knocked me out.

37:17.065 --> 37:19.364
I woke up a half an hour
ago, riding the G Line.

37:19.366 --> 37:20.732
Lucky for you.

37:21.186 --> 37:23.464
- So you let the bomb go off?
- I did.

37:24.120 --> 37:26.221
No word from the kill squad either.

37:29.225 --> 37:31.271
I'm glad Julian's no longer with us,

37:31.284 --> 37:33.661
he was too dangerous
to be out on the street.

37:34.997 --> 37:36.681
Happy you're back, though.

37:40.169 --> 37:42.687
I want this war to end, Stephen.

37:44.857 --> 37:46.441
I would...

37:47.326 --> 37:49.527
I would do anything to see it finished.

37:50.196 --> 37:51.863
What about the little girl?

37:52.865 --> 37:54.065
Charlotte?

37:54.067 --> 37:56.201
I'm sending her back to the Citadel.

37:57.403 --> 37:58.686
Where else?

38:00.372 --> 38:03.511
You know, you say this
war is to protect humanity,

38:06.695 --> 38:09.247
you don't know the first
thing about being human.

38:23.512 --> 38:25.096
I just want to go home!

38:28.198 --> 38:29.287
Please,

38:29.481 --> 38:31.714
I just want to go home.

38:33.439 --> 38:35.073
You got it, Charlotte.

38:36.192 --> 38:37.408
Russell.

38:37.595 --> 38:39.444
Buckle your seatbelt, sweetie.

38:39.446 --> 38:41.279
I like to drive pretty fast.

38:51.573 --> 38:54.720
Oh, I hope you're not going
to school looking like that.

38:54.921 --> 38:56.535
Please, let yourself in.

38:56.948 --> 38:58.594
I thought you were sick.

38:59.264 --> 39:01.232
Yeah, well I'm feeling better now.

39:01.234 --> 39:02.600
It was John, actually.

39:02.602 --> 39:04.152
Helped me to see it was all up here.

39:04.154 --> 39:05.570
Good.

39:05.901 --> 39:08.289
'Cause I don't want my other
life to come between us.

39:09.325 --> 39:11.442
I don't know what I would
do without you, Astrid.

39:14.573 --> 39:16.788
Me either.

39:18.007 --> 39:20.491
All right. Oh, um...

39:20.810 --> 39:22.287
So, you and John, huh?

39:22.755 --> 39:24.677
Mmm. Yeah.

39:25.891 --> 39:27.123
No.

39:27.467 --> 39:29.056
Go get ready.

39:36.519 --> 39:39.317
You know what the scariest
part of this whole thing was?

39:40.068 --> 39:41.883
Having to look you in the eye

39:41.924 --> 39:43.742
and see what we've lost.

39:46.629 --> 39:48.146
It's terrifying.

39:49.915 --> 39:52.734
I guess that's why I couldn't
bring myself to come back.

39:53.552 --> 39:55.320
There's nothing to be afraid of.

39:55.955 --> 39:57.488
I'm still here.

39:58.824 --> 40:00.491
We're all still here.

40:00.493 --> 40:02.184
I feel like everything we've worked

40:02.184 --> 40:04.130
so hard to build here is

40:04.524 --> 40:05.994
somehow broken.

40:11.353 --> 40:13.504
Then we will build it again.

40:16.892 --> 40:18.176
Together.

40:28.654 --> 40:29.988
You're back.

40:29.990 --> 40:31.856
Yeah, Charlie, I am.

40:32.208 --> 40:33.541
So are you.

40:34.359 --> 40:35.543
So are you.

40:48.897 --> 40:50.391
Hello, Stephen.

40:50.605 --> 40:51.418
Hey, Tim,

40:51.474 --> 40:54.202
do you know where I can find John or Cara?

40:54.596 --> 40:56.510
Oh, dear, I'm afraid,

40:56.630 --> 40:57.843
yes, I do.

40:58.767 --> 41:00.185
Okay, would you like to tell me?

41:00.439 --> 41:02.353
I was told to keep it a secret.

41:02.817 --> 41:06.339
Let's just say Cara and John
are together, and, well...

41:06.377 --> 41:07.358
indisposed.

41:10.279 --> 41:11.629
Okay.

41:11.749 --> 41:13.281
That's good.

41:13.596 --> 41:15.066
Do me a favor though, Tim?

41:15.123 --> 41:16.417
Anything, Stephen.

41:16.419 --> 41:18.670
Remind me not to tell you any secrets.

41:19.205 --> 41:20.705
What is all this stuff?

41:20.707 --> 41:22.149
According to John,

41:22.218 --> 41:24.576
remnants of your father's
various experiments.

41:40.025 --> 41:41.476
What is this?

41:41.478 --> 41:43.427
Your father never told me.

41:44.097 --> 41:46.418
But it does rather seem
to like you, doesn't it?
