WEBVTT

00:00.891 --> 00:02.507
Hurry up! We have to go!

00:02.593 --> 00:05.876
I'm sorry. I wanted to
wear my Eagles T-shirt.

00:05.901 --> 00:07.567
I can't find it anywhere.

00:08.960 --> 00:09.960
Oh.

00:10.414 --> 00:13.048
Come on, you know it looks
better with boobs in it.

00:13.084 --> 00:14.945
Well, you could say that about anything.

00:15.252 --> 00:17.002
Let's go.

00:17.149 --> 00:18.531
Bye, Christy.

00:18.556 --> 00:19.906
Bye.

00:20.986 --> 00:22.368
Are you okay?

00:22.640 --> 00:24.070
No.

00:24.095 --> 00:26.617
I am very, very sick.

00:28.933 --> 00:32.186
Well, off to serve people food.

00:33.382 --> 00:36.187
Honey, you look like
you're in The Addams Family.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.406
But I put on lip gloss.

00:38.468 --> 00:39.550
Was it gray?

00:41.662 --> 00:43.078
I think you have a fever.

00:43.174 --> 00:45.724
I gave lap dances
when I had chicken pox,

00:45.749 --> 00:47.984
I can power through
this... No, I can't. Oh.

00:50.931 --> 00:54.123
Poor thing. Ready?

00:54.182 --> 00:55.631
She's gonna be okay, right?

00:55.683 --> 00:57.844
- Are you gonna be okay?
- You bet.

00:57.869 --> 01:00.072
Okay. Love you. Have fun.

01:00.097 --> 01:01.829
I mean, bye.

01:02.299 --> 01:04.632
You're gonna stretch my
shirt out in a weird way.

01:04.685 --> 01:05.912
Yeah, like you did with my thong?

01:05.936 --> 01:08.485
That was a joke. That
was funny. You laughed.

01:10.391 --> 01:12.891
Then in '80, I saw The Long Run tour.

01:12.916 --> 01:15.583
That was the first album
Timothy B. Schmit was on.

01:15.756 --> 01:19.423
People were freaking out,
shouting, "Where's Randy?"

01:19.448 --> 01:21.696
Then when Schmit came
out and started singing

01:21.721 --> 01:24.345
"I Can't Tell You Why," it was like

01:24.370 --> 01:26.899
a hippie angel was ju...
You're not even listening

01:26.924 --> 01:28.507
to my great Eagles story.

01:29.298 --> 01:31.960
I'm sorry. I'm having
this weird feeling.

01:31.996 --> 01:33.545
A-Are-are you
gonna throw up, too?

01:33.570 --> 01:35.069
Oh, God, can you do it out the window?

01:35.094 --> 01:36.676
I just had the van detailed.

01:36.970 --> 01:39.885
It's not that. I keep
picturing Christy alone

01:39.910 --> 01:41.693
on the bathroom floor and I get sad.

01:41.784 --> 01:43.083
Or is it worried?

01:43.174 --> 01:44.845
Maybe I'm just hungry.

01:45.676 --> 01:47.477
No, it's definitely an emotion.

01:47.905 --> 01:49.321
Oh, my God.

01:49.346 --> 01:51.396
I want to go home and
take care of my daughter.

01:51.813 --> 01:54.079
N-Now? We're almost to San Francisco.

01:54.104 --> 01:56.605
I know the timing's not
great, but I got to go back.

01:56.630 --> 01:57.963
Oh.

01:58.015 --> 02:00.382
Do I got to go back?

02:00.407 --> 02:02.107
What are you... Are
you suggesting I tuck

02:02.132 --> 02:04.136
and roll out of the
van and hitchhike home?

02:04.161 --> 02:06.578
No. Actually, I was thinking
that we could pull over

02:06.603 --> 02:08.269
at that diner and-and I'd wait with you

02:08.294 --> 02:09.905
until an Uber came and
pay for your ride home.

02:09.930 --> 02:12.032
Oh, that's reasonable, let's do that.

02:14.595 --> 02:16.015
Christy!

02:17.208 --> 02:19.091
Oh, honey.

02:19.203 --> 02:20.736
Mama's here.

02:20.788 --> 02:22.571
I skipped the concert

02:22.596 --> 02:24.821
and rushed home to take care of you.

02:25.266 --> 02:26.882
Oh, no.

02:26.934 --> 02:28.837
Now I'm hallucinating.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.074

02:51.482 --> 02:54.717
How does so much stuff come
out of such a teeny person?

02:54.749 --> 02:57.235
You're like a clown car.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.293
I haven't had corn in weeks.

02:59.318 --> 03:01.151
<i>How does it do that?</i>

03:01.817 --> 03:03.832
Oh, boy, here it comes again.

03:03.857 --> 03:06.035
Hair's up, let it rip.

03:06.528 --> 03:07.803
False alarm.

03:07.828 --> 03:11.278
I'm calling it. Time of empty: 3:17.

03:12.357 --> 03:13.909
Ah.

03:13.934 --> 03:16.134
I can't believe, when I was drinking,

03:16.203 --> 03:18.496
vomiting was a regular part of my day.

03:18.521 --> 03:19.787
Yeah, mine, too.

03:19.900 --> 03:23.177
It was like sleeping or
eating or shoplifting.

03:23.653 --> 03:25.450
I actually used to choose my drinks

03:25.475 --> 03:28.439
based on how I thought they
would taste coming back up.

03:28.508 --> 03:31.009
That's pretty much the only reason
to drink crÃ©me de menthe.

03:31.077 --> 03:32.610
Barf that up, you're minty fresh,

03:32.679 --> 03:34.763
and go right back to making out.

03:35.919 --> 03:38.193
- You know what else I don't miss?
- Hmm.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.513
Having a dent in my
forehead because I passed out

03:40.538 --> 03:42.409
on a gas station toilet seat.

03:42.434 --> 03:44.201
Gas station? La-Di-da.

03:44.489 --> 03:47.892
I remember throwing up in my own pants.

03:47.917 --> 03:50.572
Aw. And it was such a shame

03:50.597 --> 03:53.185
because you had just stolen them.

03:55.380 --> 03:57.078
You want me to get you some water?

03:57.103 --> 03:59.677
Uh, water feels risky.

04:00.397 --> 04:02.684
But I think I'm ready
to leave the bathroom.

04:02.709 --> 04:05.109
- All right, let's do this.
- Ah.

04:05.178 --> 04:08.313
Lean on me. I got you.

04:08.381 --> 04:10.410
Thanks. You're a good mom.

04:10.435 --> 04:12.694
What? Oh! Sorry, sorry.

04:12.719 --> 04:14.519
I'm sorry. Oh, God.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.065
It's just you've never said those words

04:16.089 --> 04:18.822
in that order without other
really mean words in the middle.

04:19.130 --> 04:20.869
Well, it's true.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.293
This has been miserable,

04:22.318 --> 04:25.830
but... you found a way
to make it kind of...

04:25.899 --> 04:27.565
Oh, oh, boy. Go back, go back.

04:27.590 --> 04:28.923
Go back, go back.

04:28.948 --> 04:31.816
Maybe after you puke you
can finish that compliment.

04:41.411 --> 04:43.181
What? I'm in the middle of something.

04:43.206 --> 04:45.060
Where are you? The
meeting's about to start.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.919
Christy's sick, so I stayed
home to take care of her.

04:48.411 --> 04:50.989
Why do you lie for no reason?

04:51.700 --> 04:53.224
Goodbye, Jill.

04:53.249 --> 04:54.882
Bye, liar.

05:15.281 --> 05:17.622
This is so much less
stressful than stealing it

05:17.647 --> 05:19.505
from a Days Inn.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.388
What are you doing?

05:23.413 --> 05:25.013
I thought you could watch from bed.

05:25.458 --> 05:28.239
But we don't have a cable thing up here.

05:28.264 --> 05:31.052
Huh. Back you go.

05:42.475 --> 05:44.903
You know what you could do...

05:48.708 --> 05:50.358
What? What could I do?

05:50.521 --> 05:53.528
You could leave the TV,
go get the DVD player,

05:53.553 --> 05:54.819
and I could watch that.

05:56.005 --> 05:57.555
Great idea.

05:57.624 --> 06:01.159
A movie marathon of the
two DVDs we own coming up.

06:01.966 --> 06:03.872
Yay.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.591
<i>Dirty Dancing first,</i>

06:05.616 --> 06:08.614
<i>then Sheena Easton's 7 Minute Stomach.</i>

06:10.203 --> 06:11.469
Mom?

06:11.494 --> 06:12.793
Yeah?

06:12.818 --> 06:14.651
- You know what I want?
- What?

06:15.107 --> 06:16.651
Can I have some rainbow sherbet?

06:16.676 --> 06:18.042
We don't have any.

06:18.421 --> 06:20.154
The store does.

06:22.099 --> 06:24.388
Right, right. I'm on it.

06:24.413 --> 06:26.529
'Cause I'm a good mom, and
that's what good moms do.

06:26.880 --> 06:30.732
I'm just gonna take ten
bucks from your purse.

06:30.757 --> 06:32.755
I'm just gonna take the whole purse.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.169
I'm gonna take your car, too.

06:39.843 --> 06:41.747
I'm sorry, what am I getting again?

06:44.755 --> 06:46.622
Are we done cleaning up already?

06:46.647 --> 06:47.816
Record time.

06:47.841 --> 06:49.474
And with two less people.

06:49.499 --> 06:50.665
Well, you know why.

06:50.690 --> 06:51.956
Jill, be kind.

06:51.981 --> 06:54.419
Because the two less people
are Christy and Bonnie.

06:55.381 --> 06:57.048
I'm uncomfortable talking about them

06:57.117 --> 06:58.382
behind their back.

06:58.407 --> 07:00.140
Well, I'm not, and I'll say it again.

07:00.165 --> 07:02.599
Everything's easier without
Christy and Bonnie. Whoo!

07:03.622 --> 07:05.600
That's not fair. They help.

07:05.625 --> 07:08.359
You get that they're not here,
so we're being honest, right?

07:08.384 --> 07:10.184
Okay, I'll play.

07:10.209 --> 07:13.908
Have you ever noticed how
Bonnie takes, like, one chair

07:13.933 --> 07:16.801
and just leans on it until
we've finished all the work?

07:16.826 --> 07:18.826
And then Christy stops
helping to yell at Bonnie.

07:18.851 --> 07:20.718
And then we all have to stop to referee

07:20.743 --> 07:22.109
and validate their stupid feelings.

07:22.134 --> 07:23.801
And then everything's about them.

07:23.941 --> 07:25.786
Ooh, this is fun.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.380
Hey, if putting chairs
away is better without them,

07:29.405 --> 07:31.338
think how great the bistro's gonna be.

07:31.363 --> 07:33.695
Wait. Christy and Bonnie are the ones

07:33.720 --> 07:34.986
that make us go to the bistro.

07:35.011 --> 07:36.277
We can go anywhere.

07:36.302 --> 07:38.399
You're right. How about
Mexican? Or Italian.

07:38.424 --> 07:40.258
There's a Greek place around the block

07:40.283 --> 07:42.350
where the waiters dance.

07:45.064 --> 07:47.899
Okay, we'll go to the
bistro, but we don't have to.

07:47.924 --> 07:50.317
Freedom!

07:55.075 --> 07:57.408
Okay, this one's for cough,

07:57.477 --> 07:58.676
and this one's for fever.

07:58.701 --> 08:00.667
My kid has both. I
don't know what to do.

08:00.692 --> 08:01.958
Yeah. My daughter has the flu,

08:01.983 --> 08:03.925
but I don't want to give
her anything too strong.

08:03.950 --> 08:05.416
She's so tiny.

08:05.485 --> 08:08.019
This is the first time
Declan's ever been this sick.

08:08.044 --> 08:09.244
I feel completely helpless.

08:09.355 --> 08:11.322
Yeah, it's so hard to see your child

08:11.347 --> 08:12.446
lying in bed, suffering.

08:12.471 --> 08:14.402
And they don't understand
what's happening.

08:14.864 --> 08:16.571
No. You should've
seen my daughter's face

08:16.596 --> 08:18.236
when I told her she
couldn't go to school.

08:19.643 --> 08:21.776
You know, you sound
like such a good mom.

08:22.067 --> 08:24.312
Counting me, you're the third
person to say that today.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.204
Hmm.

08:26.229 --> 08:27.362
I'm going with this.

08:27.387 --> 08:28.983
It says "pediatrician recommended."

08:29.008 --> 08:31.541
I'm gonna go with this.
Christy loves purple flavor.

08:31.566 --> 08:32.932
Hmm.

08:33.591 --> 08:35.279
They say it gets easier
when they get older.

08:35.304 --> 08:37.424
Oh, fingers crossed.
Mine just turned two.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.677
How old's yours? 41.

08:47.493 --> 08:49.038
Do you guys wait for
me to pick something up,

08:49.062 --> 08:50.341
and then call?

08:50.708 --> 08:53.013
You know we can't see you, right?

08:53.233 --> 08:54.771
How's Christy?

08:54.796 --> 08:56.634
She's keeping down crackers.

08:56.659 --> 08:59.159
If that holds, we'll try some toast.

08:59.184 --> 09:02.442
If that stays put, we'll
show applesauce who's boss.

09:02.939 --> 09:04.772
Well, aren't you the good mom.

09:04.797 --> 09:06.697
That's the word on the street.

09:06.722 --> 09:07.899
I got to tell you, if I'd known

09:07.924 --> 09:09.691
taking care of your
kid was so rewarding,

09:09.716 --> 09:11.349
I would've jumped in much sooner.

09:11.962 --> 09:14.229
Yeah, too bad the joys of motherhood

09:14.254 --> 09:16.420
are such a well-kept secret.

09:16.608 --> 09:17.636
Totally. Someone should

09:17.661 --> 09:19.304
put that on Facebook.

09:19.849 --> 09:24.107
- I got to go.
- Tell Christy I said feel... hello?

09:25.114 --> 09:27.665
Hey. Hey. How was the concert?

09:27.690 --> 09:30.157
- Ah, it was okay.
- Just okay?

09:30.182 --> 09:32.513
I feel bad talking about
it 'cause you weren't there.

09:32.538 --> 09:35.706
Honey, I made a choice
to put my child first,

09:35.731 --> 09:37.085
and it's been deeply fulfilling.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.776
I don't regret missing the show at all.

09:38.845 --> 09:40.778
I went backstage!

09:40.847 --> 09:42.513
What?!

09:42.538 --> 09:45.326
Yes. I'm sitting next
to Joe Walsh's dentist.

09:45.351 --> 09:48.219
He totally hooked me
up. I met all the guys.

09:48.244 --> 09:50.198
That's... great.

09:50.223 --> 09:52.711
Yeah. Joe Walsh let me
noodle around on his guitar.

09:52.736 --> 09:54.402
That's what he called it. "Noodling."

09:54.427 --> 09:56.193
We hung out till 3:00 a.m.

09:56.218 --> 09:59.507
Don Henley asked me if I wanted
to split an egg roll with him.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.232
I was like, "Yeah."

10:01.301 --> 10:03.344
It was so awesome.

10:03.369 --> 10:05.614
I-I-I-I... Sorry.

10:05.639 --> 10:10.542
Don't be. I'm... actually fine.

10:10.567 --> 10:12.176
Really? You're not mad that I had

10:12.201 --> 10:14.212
the greatest night of my
life, and you weren't there?

10:14.280 --> 10:16.881
No. Would I have loved
to share an egg roll

10:16.906 --> 10:18.016
with Don Henley? Absolutely.

10:18.041 --> 10:19.825
I bet he'd take the smaller half.

10:20.544 --> 10:22.765
But my daughter needed me,
and I was there for her.

10:22.789 --> 10:25.222
So I had the greatest
night of my life, too.

10:25.521 --> 10:29.871
Mom... I puked on my pillow.

10:30.442 --> 10:32.496
Got to go.

10:32.817 --> 10:35.794
- I have a picture of me and the guys.
- Don't push it!

10:38.755 --> 10:40.235
And because of that I had

10:40.260 --> 10:43.210
to empty the entire refrigerator.

10:43.235 --> 10:44.661
The meat had spoiled,

10:44.686 --> 10:46.486
and the cheese had spoiled.

10:46.511 --> 10:48.882
And I didn't think the
lettuce had spoiled,

10:48.907 --> 10:50.974
but it did spoil.

10:52.184 --> 10:53.677
Darn it, I got to pee.

10:53.702 --> 10:55.099
I'll finish the story when I come back.

10:55.124 --> 10:56.990
Can't wait, sweetie.

10:57.316 --> 10:59.919
Oh, my God, she thinks that's a story.

11:00.513 --> 11:02.780
I lost seven years of my life in prison.

11:02.805 --> 11:05.099
I can't afford to sit through this.

11:05.351 --> 11:06.450
What's going on?

11:06.475 --> 11:08.742
I'll tell you what's going on.

11:08.855 --> 11:10.788
Our apex predator is missing.

11:11.505 --> 11:12.433
What?

11:12.458 --> 11:14.959
I saw this show on the
Nature Channel last night.

11:14.984 --> 11:17.050
I didn't want to watch it,
but my nails weren't dry,

11:17.075 --> 11:19.099
so I couldn't touch the remote.

11:19.532 --> 11:22.400
Turns out there are these
things called ecosystems,

11:22.425 --> 11:24.726
and when one piece is missing...

11:25.067 --> 11:28.339
- whole thing goes to hell.
- I see where you're going.

11:28.452 --> 11:30.018
Not a clue.

11:30.677 --> 11:32.887
Well, in India they have rats.

11:32.912 --> 11:34.552
But not too many,
because they have snakes

11:34.581 --> 11:36.080
that eat the rats.

11:36.105 --> 11:38.560
But not too many, because
they also have mongooses

11:38.585 --> 11:39.905
that eat the snakes.

11:39.930 --> 11:42.297
It's gross but it's beautiful.

11:42.365 --> 11:44.632
What does this have to
do with Wendy accidentally

11:44.657 --> 11:46.290
unplugging her fridge?

11:47.052 --> 11:49.837
She's the rat, and she's
telling endless stories

11:49.862 --> 11:51.540
because our snake's
been home for three days

11:51.564 --> 11:53.464
taking care of our
little blonde mongoose.

11:54.275 --> 11:56.950
Oh, this was a metaphor.

12:02.919 --> 12:05.543
Yikes. 102.7.

12:05.568 --> 12:07.301
102.7.

12:07.413 --> 12:10.648
All of today's hits with
half the commercials.

12:11.247 --> 12:12.827
I made you some soup.

12:12.852 --> 12:15.661
No soup for me.

12:16.900 --> 12:19.234
When I say I made it, I
don't mean I microwaved it.

12:19.259 --> 12:22.837
<i>I mean I... made it.</i>

12:22.862 --> 12:25.696
I did everything but... the chicken.

12:26.732 --> 12:29.300
- You know what I really want?
- Soup?

12:29.413 --> 12:32.670
- A bath.
- Honey, I don't know.

12:32.783 --> 12:35.116
Maybe we should wait
till your fever breaks.

12:35.185 --> 12:37.541
- Bath.
- Soup.

12:37.829 --> 12:39.896
Can I take a bath in the soup?

12:41.138 --> 12:43.192
If it makes you feel
better, I haven't had a bath

12:43.216 --> 12:45.816
or a shower or a full night's
sleep in the last three days.

12:46.028 --> 12:48.302
Why would that make me feel better?

12:48.821 --> 12:50.132
I don't know. It's just an update.

12:50.156 --> 12:51.505
Now take a nap.

12:52.480 --> 12:53.412
But I don't want to.

12:53.437 --> 12:56.037
Take a nap, take a nap, take a nap.

12:56.062 --> 12:59.271
Okay. Oh...

13:03.849 --> 13:05.880
I'll take a nap in the bath.

13:08.517 --> 13:11.542
- Hey.
- Hey. When did you get here?

13:11.654 --> 13:13.554
Couple of minutes ago.

13:13.579 --> 13:15.997
So, uh, what's going on?

13:16.022 --> 13:18.325
I made soup.

13:20.127 --> 13:21.994
Did any of it get in the pot?

13:23.456 --> 13:26.192
Ooh, sarcasm. Just what I need.

13:27.427 --> 13:28.693
Why are you here?

13:28.760 --> 13:30.271
I haven't seen you for a couple of days.

13:30.296 --> 13:32.317
I miss you, although
this short interaction

13:32.342 --> 13:34.142
has fixed that.

13:34.771 --> 13:36.434
I'm sorry, I'm exhausted.

13:36.502 --> 13:38.657
I'm making 27 cups of tea a day,

13:38.682 --> 13:39.914
soup that nobody eats.

13:39.939 --> 13:41.317
I'm sleeping on the floor next to her

13:41.341 --> 13:42.573
in case she needs me.

13:42.642 --> 13:43.852
I finally got a look under the bed.

13:43.876 --> 13:46.099
I think I know how Christy got sick.

13:47.079 --> 13:49.021
Well, is there anything
I can do to help?

13:50.486 --> 13:52.106
Yeah.

13:52.819 --> 13:54.218
You can eat my damn soup.

13:54.513 --> 13:56.164
Actually, I just had a cheeseburger.

13:56.189 --> 13:57.955
Eat it!

14:20.480 --> 14:21.645
Damn it!

14:21.757 --> 14:22.890
Huh?

14:22.915 --> 14:24.081
What's happening?

14:24.106 --> 14:27.441
You left the tub on.
There's water everywhere.

14:29.422 --> 14:32.060
I told you no bath.

14:34.527 --> 14:37.015
I just washed those.
What are you doing?!

14:37.040 --> 14:37.972
I'm helping.

14:37.997 --> 14:39.363
Stop it!

14:39.432 --> 14:41.065
Now you got your PJs wet.

14:41.134 --> 14:43.716
God, you're driving me crazy!

14:45.271 --> 14:46.552
I'm sorry.

14:47.507 --> 14:49.039
I'm sorry.

14:49.108 --> 14:51.614
I was just try... try...

14:52.833 --> 14:54.355
trying to help.

14:55.153 --> 14:57.158
I know you were. It's okay, it's okay.

14:57.183 --> 14:59.617
Let's, uh, let's get you changed
and get back to bed, okay?

15:02.834 --> 15:04.333
Mommy loves you.

15:07.716 --> 15:11.128
Just... stay still, don't move.

15:11.197 --> 15:12.329
Ooh!

15:14.778 --> 15:17.078
Oh, come on.

15:17.103 --> 15:19.069
- I'll get it.
- No, I'll get it.

15:19.137 --> 15:20.415
Just put these on and get back in bed

15:20.440 --> 15:22.373
and don't do anything else.

15:22.481 --> 15:23.980
Uh-huh.

15:33.075 --> 15:34.376
Oh...

15:43.998 --> 15:45.465
I got the door. Keep eating.

15:45.490 --> 15:47.390
- But I hurt.
- I said eat.

15:50.736 --> 15:53.658
Hey, we just came by
to see how it's going.

15:53.683 --> 15:56.784
It's going great. Really great.

15:56.809 --> 15:58.196
Why are you wet?

15:58.221 --> 15:59.754
'Cause it's going bad.

15:59.779 --> 16:01.685
Really bad.

16:01.981 --> 16:03.747
You poor thing.

16:03.859 --> 16:05.893
One time at the hospital,
I had 14 patients...

16:05.918 --> 16:07.251
Oh, shut up, Wendy.

16:07.320 --> 16:09.505
Yeah, baby, get that rat.

16:10.669 --> 16:13.457
Mom? Can I take a bath?

16:13.526 --> 16:15.045
Oh, my God. I'm coming.

16:15.070 --> 16:16.904
No, you sit. I got this.

16:16.973 --> 16:18.673
Wendy, take care of Christy.

16:19.630 --> 16:21.827
Tammy, why don't you
go make Bonnie some tea?

16:21.852 --> 16:22.951
Coming up.

16:23.746 --> 16:25.012
Oh, hi, Adam.

16:25.037 --> 16:27.150
Why didn't anyone tell me he was here?

16:27.175 --> 16:29.108
What you doing?

16:32.552 --> 16:33.654
I tried.

16:34.755 --> 16:37.335
I tried to be perfect
and then I yelled at her.

16:37.360 --> 16:39.093
I yelled at my sick child.

16:39.162 --> 16:40.628
I'm a monster.

16:40.653 --> 16:42.574
Bonnie, even the best mom in the world

16:42.622 --> 16:44.871
is gonna lose it once in a while.

16:44.926 --> 16:47.489
No one told me being a
parent would be this hard.

16:47.571 --> 16:49.971
Really? I don't even have
a kid and I know that.

16:49.996 --> 16:51.607
I mean, just look around the airport.

16:51.631 --> 16:53.599
People are losing their minds.

16:54.700 --> 16:56.934
It was going so well. I
don't know what happened.

16:57.046 --> 16:59.146
You stopped taking care of yourself.

16:59.466 --> 17:01.393
When was the last time
you went to a meeting?

17:01.418 --> 17:02.984
Or had a manicure?

17:03.095 --> 17:05.395
Did you dig a shallow
grave with those things?

17:06.454 --> 17:07.954
Christy needs me.

17:07.980 --> 17:10.848
If I leave her now, I'm
exactly who I used to be.

17:10.961 --> 17:12.894
If you left to score
coke and didn't come back

17:12.919 --> 17:14.723
for four days, then, yeah.

17:14.748 --> 17:16.079
But a manicure's okay.

17:17.490 --> 17:19.340
Or a meeting.

17:19.992 --> 17:21.954
It's hard to be there for someone else

17:21.979 --> 17:24.356
if you're falling apart.

17:24.997 --> 17:27.665
You going to a meeting is
you taking care of Christy.

17:29.739 --> 17:32.046
You could go to a
meeting, then a manicure.

17:32.071 --> 17:34.792
I don't want to put on my pajamas.

17:34.817 --> 17:36.414
And you can't make me.

17:36.439 --> 17:39.574
That's it. I'm done having children!

17:50.292 --> 17:52.625
Froot Loops.

17:52.694 --> 17:55.461
Oh, or do I want Lucky Charms?

17:55.903 --> 17:57.463
Oh, can I get both?

17:57.488 --> 17:59.448
You know how you get when
you have too much sugar.

17:59.919 --> 18:03.225
Come on. I was sick for a week. Please?

18:03.250 --> 18:06.554
- Okay, but just this one time.
- Yay!

18:07.008 --> 18:09.842
Ooh, you know what else I
really want? Canned ravioli.

18:09.867 --> 18:11.367
I thought we were done throwing up.

18:11.392 --> 18:13.349
Please.

18:14.232 --> 18:16.778
- Fine, but that's it.
- Yay!

18:23.881 --> 18:26.582
Declan's mom? Christy's mom.

18:26.607 --> 18:28.406
Oh, hi.

18:28.431 --> 18:29.730
What's going on?

18:29.755 --> 18:31.987
Declan's cold turned
into the stomach flu

18:32.012 --> 18:34.376
and then into an ear
infection and now it's strep

18:34.401 --> 18:35.968
and I can't stop crying

18:35.993 --> 18:39.880
and I am just failing so
hard at this mom stuff.

18:39.905 --> 18:42.765
Where is Declan now?
He's with my husband.

18:42.790 --> 18:45.060
Okay, text him and tell him
you're gonna be a little late.

18:45.085 --> 18:48.337
- Why? - Because you and I are
gonna go get our nails done.

18:48.362 --> 18:50.595
- Oh, I don't, I...
- You can't take care of your son

18:50.620 --> 18:52.386
unless you take care of yourself.

18:52.411 --> 18:54.520
I'm too tired to argue.

18:54.545 --> 18:55.678
Kids will do that to you.

18:56.761 --> 18:57.761
By the way, I'm Bonnie.

18:57.786 --> 18:59.185
Mackenzie.

19:00.044 --> 19:01.917
Can I at least get my groceries?

19:01.986 --> 19:03.419
No.

19:08.637 --> 19:10.537
Mom?

19:11.796 --> 19:13.729
Mom?

19:16.427 --> 19:17.743
I lost my mom.
