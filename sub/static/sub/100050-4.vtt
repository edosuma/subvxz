00:07.137 --> 00:09.444
Previously onYoung Sheldon...What the hell's going on?

00:09.487 --> 00:10.880
Mom thinks that I'm crazy.

00:12.925 --> 00:15.145
I thought we weren't supposed
to say stuff like that.

00:15.189 --> 00:16.407
Baby, there's something
I need to tell you.

00:16.451 --> 00:18.061
Dr. Sturgis

00:18.105 --> 00:22.065
is not in the kind of hospital
you think he is.

00:22.109 --> 00:24.067
What kind of
hospital is he in?

00:24.111 --> 00:26.417
The psychiatric kind.

00:26.461 --> 00:29.551
And you think since he
and I are both gifted,

00:29.594 --> 00:31.031
I'm going to
end up like him?

00:31.074 --> 00:33.076
Oh, baby.

00:34.338 --> 00:36.862
See how valuable
a little communication can be?

00:36.906 --> 00:38.212
You do not take credit for this.

00:40.301 --> 00:43.652
ADULT SHELDON: You never know where scientific inspiration will strike.

00:43.695 --> 00:45.828
For Newton,
it was under an apple tree.

00:45.871 --> 00:48.091
For Archimedes,
it was sitting in a bathtub.

00:48.135 --> 00:50.441
For me, on this particular day,

00:50.485 --> 00:53.140
it had a "sweaty people
eating meat" kind of vibe.

00:53.183 --> 00:55.881
Sheldon, do you really have to
do that here?

00:55.925 --> 00:57.231
If the management

00:57.274 --> 00:59.102
didn't want me to solve
unified field theory,

00:59.146 --> 01:00.712
why would they
give me a crayon?

01:00.756 --> 01:03.106
I told you to crack a window
and leave him in the car.

01:03.150 --> 01:04.542
It occurred to me

01:04.586 --> 01:06.631
that Maxwell's equations
would achieve full symmetry

01:06.675 --> 01:09.025
by adding a magnetic monopole.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.766
I drew a ladybug.

01:11.854 --> 01:12.681
All right, y'all.

01:13.812 --> 01:15.379
Oh...Is it okay to set this down?

01:15.423 --> 01:17.686
I'm a little busy.
Could you come back later?

01:17.729 --> 01:18.817
Sheldon, I'm hungry.

01:18.861 --> 01:20.341
Let's just sit
over there.

01:20.384 --> 01:23.170
No. We're gonna eat
together as a family.

01:23.213 --> 01:26.260
Instead of electricity,
we'll have magnetricity.

01:26.303 --> 01:28.044
It's getting heavy.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.568
We'll be right over
here if you need us.

01:30.612 --> 01:31.569
Let's go.

01:31.613 --> 01:33.267
Bye, ladybug.

01:34.398 --> 01:37.271
♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪

01:37.314 --> 01:40.056
♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain

01:40.100 --> 01:42.798
♪ I bet I could be your hero

01:42.841 --> 01:45.714
♪ I am a mighty little man

01:45.757 --> 01:49.283
♪ I am a mighty little man.♪

01:57.291 --> 01:59.031
Baby, you need to eat something.

01:59.075 --> 02:01.077
But it looks like I can change
the definitions

02:01.121 --> 02:02.687
of electric and magnetic fields

02:02.731 --> 02:05.603
and rotate the magnetic charge
away mathematically to zero.

02:05.647 --> 02:07.344
Maybe some fried okra
would help.

02:07.388 --> 02:09.477
Richard Feynman didn't develop
quantum electrodynamics

02:09.520 --> 02:11.479
by filling up on fried okra.

02:11.522 --> 02:13.829
Well, maybe that's
because his mama didn't love him

02:13.872 --> 02:15.700
as much as I love you.

02:15.744 --> 02:17.789
ADULT SHELDON:
Richard Feynman was Jewish.

02:17.833 --> 02:20.575
His mother didn't give him
fried okra.

02:23.752 --> 02:27.147
Ugh. What am I missing?

02:28.235 --> 02:29.453
Wake me up one more time,

02:29.497 --> 02:31.412
and I will sneeze
in your mittens.

02:31.455 --> 02:34.154
A big, wet, snotty one.

02:40.290 --> 02:42.249
Baby, what are you doing?

02:42.292 --> 02:43.467
Working.

02:45.077 --> 02:46.601
Have you been out here
all night?

02:46.644 --> 02:48.211
No. Why, what time is it?

02:48.255 --> 02:50.257
7:30.

02:50.300 --> 02:51.693
Oh. Then yes.

02:56.132 --> 02:57.742
Son of a...

02:57.786 --> 02:59.179
Dad, you busy?

02:59.222 --> 03:00.745
Do I look like I'm busy?

03:00.789 --> 03:03.618
I can't see what you look like.
You're under the sink.

03:03.661 --> 03:05.272
What do you want?

03:05.315 --> 03:07.187
Would you teach me
how to throw a baseball?

03:08.362 --> 03:10.059
What's bringing this on?

03:11.495 --> 03:14.019
♪ Saying I love you

03:14.063 --> 03:16.370
♪ Is not the words

03:16.413 --> 03:20.548
♪ I want to hear from you

03:20.591 --> 03:24.334
♪ More than words

03:24.378 --> 03:26.249
♪ Is all...

03:26.293 --> 03:28.208
I don't know, just seems fun.

03:28.251 --> 03:30.079
Sure, why not?

03:30.122 --> 03:31.254
Great, I'll get the gloves.

03:31.298 --> 03:33.213
Not now!

03:36.390 --> 03:38.174
So, what's new?

03:38.218 --> 03:40.089
I'm worried about Sheldon.

03:40.132 --> 03:42.265
I said "new."

03:42.309 --> 03:44.354
He's not sleeping,
he's not eating.

03:44.398 --> 03:46.226
We went out
for barbecue last night,

03:46.269 --> 03:47.401
and he didn't
touch a thing.

03:47.444 --> 03:49.272
He also started
biting his nails.

03:49.316 --> 03:51.187
I've never seen him
do that before.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.971
Is he worried about something?

03:53.015 --> 03:55.496
He's fixated
on some science problem.

03:55.539 --> 03:56.758
Well, I'm sure he'll solve it

03:56.801 --> 03:58.629
and then everything
will go back to normal.

03:58.673 --> 03:59.891
I hope so.

04:02.633 --> 04:04.418
What's going on with John?

04:04.461 --> 04:06.420
Not much.

04:06.463 --> 04:09.205
We write letters back and forth.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.511
That's romantic.

04:10.554 --> 04:12.513
Romantic if he
were off to war,

04:12.556 --> 04:14.602
not in a mental hospital.

04:14.645 --> 04:19.259
Well, he's at war
with his inner demons.

04:23.350 --> 04:26.396
You're right-handed, yeah?You don't know?

04:26.440 --> 04:28.529
Okay, smartass, which one am I?

04:28.572 --> 04:31.227
I'm right-handed.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.273
Put this on your left hand.

04:34.404 --> 04:36.014
You ever thrown a ball before?

04:36.058 --> 04:37.407
Just rocks at Sheldon.

04:37.451 --> 04:38.887
Did you hit him?

04:38.930 --> 04:40.236
Every time.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.412
So, we got something
to work with.

04:42.456 --> 04:44.327
All right, since
you're right-handed,

04:44.371 --> 04:46.329
which I now know,

04:46.373 --> 04:48.505
you're gonna bring your arm up

04:48.549 --> 04:51.465
and follow through like this.

04:51.508 --> 04:53.510
Okay.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.341
Nice. You might be a natural.

04:58.385 --> 05:00.778
I'm not surprised.
This is the arm I color with.

05:03.172 --> 05:04.565
I wasn't even aware
I was chewing them.

05:04.608 --> 05:06.436
Baby, I think
this math problem

05:06.480 --> 05:09.483
you're working on
is stressing you out.

05:09.526 --> 05:12.486
It makes sense. Einstein
struggled with it for 30 years

05:12.529 --> 05:14.444
and never found a solution.

05:14.488 --> 05:18.666
Maybe if you stop thinking about
it, it'll just come to you.

05:18.709 --> 05:20.755
No. I can't stop.
Sheldon.

05:20.798 --> 05:22.409
If I stop, I'll lose momentum.

05:22.452 --> 05:23.801
I'll never solve it.
I'll be a failure.

05:23.845 --> 05:25.325
My life will be worthless.

05:25.368 --> 05:28.502
Okay, that's it. You're taking
a break from science.

05:28.545 --> 05:30.895
Give me one good reason
why I would do that.

05:30.939 --> 05:33.245
Where is Dr. Sturgis right now?

05:33.289 --> 05:35.335
That's a good reason.

05:40.035 --> 05:41.341
All right, remember,
you need to look

05:41.384 --> 05:42.646
right where you want
the ball to go.

05:42.690 --> 05:43.865
Where else would I look?

05:43.908 --> 05:45.083
Well, in the last five minutes,

05:45.127 --> 05:46.389
I saw you watch a butterfly,

05:46.433 --> 05:48.260
a squirrel
and the ice cream truck.

05:48.304 --> 05:50.480
You looked
at the ice cream truck, too.

05:53.091 --> 05:56.399
Which team has a big red "T"
on their hat?

05:56.443 --> 05:57.444
Texas Rangers.

05:57.487 --> 05:59.010
Is that a team we like?Uh, yeah.

05:59.054 --> 06:02.579
Yeah, that's who most people
around here root for.

06:02.623 --> 06:06.844
Okay. And what's something
I could say about the Rangers?

06:06.888 --> 06:08.411
You know, to sound cool.

06:08.455 --> 06:10.544
Is this about a boy?
No.

06:10.587 --> 06:11.762
All right, sorry.

06:14.678 --> 06:19.204
If you want, you could say,
"Even though Nolan Ryan is old,

06:19.248 --> 06:21.468
the Rangers were
still smart to get him."

06:21.511 --> 06:22.904
That's a real thing?

06:22.947 --> 06:24.384
That's a real thing.

06:24.427 --> 06:26.386
How old is Nolan Ryan?

06:26.429 --> 06:27.474
My age.

06:27.517 --> 06:29.127
Ew.

06:30.868 --> 06:32.435
I'm so used to thinking
about science,

06:32.479 --> 06:34.002
I'm not sure
how to make myself stop.

06:34.045 --> 06:35.307
As soon as I
think about

06:35.351 --> 06:38.354
not thinking about it,
I'm thinking about it.

06:38.398 --> 06:41.444
Well, why don't you just think
about something else?

06:41.488 --> 06:43.490
Like what?
I don't know.

06:43.533 --> 06:44.926
Read a comic book?

06:44.969 --> 06:46.449
How do you think the spider
that bit Peter Parker

06:46.493 --> 06:48.277
got radioactive? Science.

06:48.320 --> 06:50.366
How do you think Bruce Banner
got exposed to gamma rays?

06:50.410 --> 06:52.281
Science.
All right.

06:52.324 --> 06:53.587
When the Green Goblin flies...

06:53.630 --> 06:55.589
I said all right.
Science.

06:55.632 --> 06:57.329
I know you don't
want to hear this,

06:57.373 --> 07:00.463
but I find prayer can bring
incredible peace of mind.

07:00.507 --> 07:02.422
Come on, Mary,
I'm trying to help the kid.

07:03.988 --> 07:05.337
You just need a new hobby.

07:05.381 --> 07:07.775
Very well. What are yours?

07:07.818 --> 07:09.559
Smoking, drinking and gambling.

07:09.603 --> 07:12.562
But we can find you
something almost as fun.

07:12.606 --> 07:15.478
Let's sweat again!

07:15.522 --> 07:16.697
Come on, everybody!

07:16.740 --> 07:18.133
MEEMAW:
Come on, Sheldon.

07:18.176 --> 07:20.396
Let's get that blood pumping.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.224
I'd rather not.

07:22.267 --> 07:24.966
Do it.
A little exercise will help

07:25.009 --> 07:26.402
get your head
out of your butt.

07:29.231 --> 07:32.582
RICHARD SIMMONS:
Get those hands going.

07:32.626 --> 07:33.975
Back to the front.

07:34.018 --> 07:35.498
What do you think?

07:35.542 --> 07:37.413
I think I hate this.

07:37.457 --> 07:41.199
Well, you're not thinking
about science now, am I right?

07:41.243 --> 07:43.506
I'm thinking about
how miserable I am.

07:43.550 --> 07:45.421
SIMMONS:
Let's get on that train. Can we?

07:45.465 --> 07:47.597
Back to the front. Come on.

07:49.294 --> 07:50.426
Three.

07:50.470 --> 07:53.211
Yes. Four.
Count them out for me!

07:53.255 --> 07:54.822
Five. Uh-huh.

07:58.260 --> 08:00.610
B-14.

08:00.654 --> 08:02.830
B-14.

08:06.573 --> 08:07.922
What else you got?

08:13.057 --> 08:16.583
Are you positive other people's
fingers haven't been in this?

08:16.626 --> 08:18.541
I made sure
to get you a new one.

08:18.585 --> 08:20.543
It doesn't look new.It's new.

08:20.587 --> 08:21.413
Let her rip.

08:28.595 --> 08:30.727
I'm still thinking
about science.

08:30.771 --> 08:32.424
That's okay.

08:32.468 --> 08:35.123
Just aim for the front pin.

09:19.863 --> 09:22.518
You and Missy looked like
you were having fun today.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.999
Uh, yeah, we were.

09:25.042 --> 09:27.001
A little father-daughter
bonding.

09:27.044 --> 09:29.351
Yeah. It was nice.

09:29.394 --> 09:32.528
Hmm. You guys were
out there for a while.

09:34.617 --> 09:35.879
What were you talking about?

09:35.923 --> 09:38.969
Oh, you know, just... life.

09:40.014 --> 09:42.277
Sure.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.279
Everything okay?

09:44.322 --> 09:46.150
Everything's fine.

09:46.194 --> 09:48.239
Nothing to worry about.

09:50.285 --> 09:52.156
You're really not
gonna tell me?

09:52.200 --> 09:54.289
No.

10:00.425 --> 10:02.297
Hey there, Sheldon.
What can I do for ya?

10:02.340 --> 10:03.820
I'm wondering
if you have any books

10:03.864 --> 10:05.605
on stopping bad habits.

10:05.648 --> 10:07.998
A few. What habit are
you trying to stop?

10:08.042 --> 10:09.913
Science.Yowza.

10:09.957 --> 10:10.958
It's not permanent.

10:11.001 --> 10:12.786
I'm just looking
to take a break.

10:12.829 --> 10:14.526
I've heard that one before.

10:14.570 --> 10:15.919
What did you
take a break from?

10:15.963 --> 10:17.704
Happiness.

10:17.747 --> 10:18.792
Okay.

10:18.835 --> 10:20.271
I've tried
a few different activities,

10:20.315 --> 10:22.622
but whatever I do
just leads me back to science.

10:22.665 --> 10:25.625
Well, let's think about it.
What's the opposite of science?

10:25.668 --> 10:26.713
Science is based in facts,

10:26.756 --> 10:29.280
and the opposite
of facts is fiction.

10:29.324 --> 10:30.542
How about fantasy?

10:30.586 --> 10:32.022
Magic and dragons.

10:32.066 --> 10:33.763
We have a whole section here.

10:33.807 --> 10:36.026
Ooh, that sounds
intellectually bankrupt.

10:36.070 --> 10:37.637
I'll give it a shot.

10:39.682 --> 10:40.944
Good news.

10:40.988 --> 10:43.164
I found a way to take a break
from science.

10:43.207 --> 10:44.818
That's great. What is it?

10:44.861 --> 10:48.604
A fantasy book series
called The Lord of the Rings.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.911
Well, it's got "the Lord" in it.

10:50.954 --> 10:52.652
That's something.

10:59.441 --> 11:01.312
That one had some zip on it.

11:01.356 --> 11:02.357
Zip's a good thing, right?

11:02.400 --> 11:03.837
Yes.

11:04.838 --> 11:06.709
So it looks like
I know what I'm doing?

11:06.753 --> 11:08.406
Just like a pro.

11:08.450 --> 11:10.582
But like a lady pro?

11:10.626 --> 11:12.628
Oh, yes. Very much.

11:14.412 --> 11:16.893
Is there anything else good
I could say about the Rangers?

11:16.937 --> 11:19.330
Uh, let's see.

11:19.374 --> 11:21.898
Tell whoever's interested

11:21.942 --> 11:25.206
that no one's ever gonna touch
Nolan Ryan's strikeout record.

11:25.249 --> 11:27.034
'Cause he strikes out
all the time.

11:27.077 --> 11:28.339
No.

11:28.383 --> 11:30.864
Because he throws
strikeouts all the time.

11:30.907 --> 11:33.083
Oh. Big difference.

11:33.127 --> 11:34.476
Dinner's ready.

11:34.519 --> 11:36.521
Five more minutes?

11:37.479 --> 11:38.654
She wants five more minutes

11:38.698 --> 11:39.786
with her ole dad.

11:43.572 --> 11:45.661
What are they
doing out there?

11:45.705 --> 11:47.881
They're bonding. It's great.
Sheldon, how's your book?

11:47.924 --> 11:49.447
Nice pivot.

11:49.491 --> 11:50.927
SHELDON:
Excellent. There's a character

11:50.971 --> 11:53.582
named Gollum who was corrupted
by the Ring of Power.

11:53.625 --> 11:56.759
Now he runs around naked and
bites the heads off fish.

11:56.803 --> 11:58.500
MEEMAW:
That's called sushi.

11:58.543 --> 12:01.546
Which, by the way, I
will die before I eat.

12:01.590 --> 12:03.244
Speaking of dying,
when you do,

12:03.287 --> 12:04.636
can I have your car?

12:08.858 --> 12:10.164
This can't be right.

12:11.556 --> 12:12.819
What now?

12:12.862 --> 12:14.646
In the letter
that Gandalf leaves for Frodo

12:14.690 --> 12:16.779
at The Prancing Pony, he says
that it's Mid-year's Day,

12:16.823 --> 12:19.564
Shire year 1418.
However,

12:19.608 --> 12:21.871
in Appendix B, it says
that Gandalf met Radagast

12:21.915 --> 12:24.744
on June 29,
which is impossible because...

12:24.787 --> 12:26.354
Hey!

12:26.397 --> 12:27.616
Next time, it's my shoe.

12:27.659 --> 12:29.661
And I will put zip on it.

12:32.882 --> 12:37.060
"The man who lived in the town
was tall."

12:37.104 --> 12:39.541
Which word
is the relative pronoun?

12:39.584 --> 12:41.195
Sheldon.

12:41.238 --> 12:43.414
Have you read
The Lord of the Rings?

12:43.458 --> 12:45.416
Um, I have,

12:45.460 --> 12:47.767
but that's not what
we're really doing right now.

12:47.810 --> 12:49.116
The relative pronoun is "who."

12:49.159 --> 12:50.813
Now, did you notice
that in Fellowship,

12:50.857 --> 12:52.815
Elrond says that the
foundations of Barad-dûr

12:52.859 --> 12:54.686
were made with the One Ring?

12:54.730 --> 12:56.688
Let's say sure.

12:56.732 --> 12:59.430
However, in Appendix B,
"The Tale of Years," it's clear

12:59.474 --> 13:02.564
that Sauron began building
Barad-dûr in Second Age 1000,

13:02.607 --> 13:06.133
600 years
before the ring was forged.

13:07.134 --> 13:08.309
Georgie.

13:08.352 --> 13:09.963
Imagine living with this.

13:10.006 --> 13:12.052
An hour a day is enough.

13:13.967 --> 13:15.707
The timeline doesn't make sense.
I mean, it lists

13:15.751 --> 13:17.535
Samwise Gamgee's
birth year as both

13:17.579 --> 13:20.190
2963 and 2980.

13:20.234 --> 13:22.366
Maybe he lied about his age.

13:22.410 --> 13:24.064
Why?I don't know. Maybe he thinks

13:24.107 --> 13:26.631
his neck makes him
look older than he is.

13:26.675 --> 13:28.198
But he's only in his 30s.

13:28.242 --> 13:29.504
That's young.

13:29.547 --> 13:31.071
Thank you.

13:31.114 --> 13:33.682
For a hobbit.
For a human, that's mommy-age.

13:33.725 --> 13:36.424
Thank you.

13:36.467 --> 13:37.642
When Frodo and Sam

13:37.686 --> 13:39.122
are riding through the Shire,
the book says

13:39.166 --> 13:40.602
the moon went westward,

13:40.645 --> 13:42.430
but according to the calendar
Tolkien created,

13:42.473 --> 13:43.823
there should have been
no moon visible.

13:43.866 --> 13:45.868
But in the appendix,
Tolkien covers himself

13:45.912 --> 13:47.522
by saying there may
be mistranslations

13:47.565 --> 13:48.828
from the Red Book.

13:48.871 --> 13:50.699
Fictional Tolkien says that,

13:50.742 --> 13:52.483
but I can't help wondering
if real Tolkien,

13:52.527 --> 13:53.658
who wrote the book,
made the mistake

13:53.702 --> 13:55.486
or if it was
an intentional mistake

13:55.530 --> 13:56.574
made by the fictional Tolkien,

13:56.618 --> 13:58.272
who translated
these real-world events

13:58.315 --> 14:00.317
from an original source.

14:01.666 --> 14:03.190
Oh, no.

14:03.233 --> 14:05.192
Is that how I sound to people?

14:05.235 --> 14:07.281
Hey! You want to throw
the ball around?

14:08.586 --> 14:10.284
No, go away.

14:11.589 --> 14:13.548
Did something happen at school?

14:13.591 --> 14:16.072
I don't want to talk about it.

14:16.116 --> 14:19.119
Okay. Well...

14:21.164 --> 14:24.124
You change your mind,
you know I'm here for you.

14:28.389 --> 14:31.392
He likes someone else.

14:47.495 --> 14:49.453
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

14:49.497 --> 14:52.848
She doesn't even know
who Nolan Ryan is.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.459
This guy sounds like an idiot.

14:55.503 --> 14:57.374
He's not. He's perfect.

14:57.418 --> 14:58.985
All right.

15:01.074 --> 15:02.640
Want me to get your mom?

15:02.684 --> 15:04.338
No.

15:04.381 --> 15:06.557
You want me to beat this guy up?

15:06.601 --> 15:09.125
No.

15:10.170 --> 15:11.693
What can I do?

15:16.785 --> 15:18.787
Nice.

15:20.789 --> 15:22.834
How do you make it curve?

15:22.878 --> 15:24.532
Well, that's a little tricky.

15:24.575 --> 15:27.622
You... you put two fingers
on the seam.

15:27.665 --> 15:30.625
Right?
And then you flick your wrist.

15:30.668 --> 15:32.279
Okay.Yeah? Here, try it.

15:33.280 --> 15:35.760
Two... Oh, so there.

15:35.804 --> 15:37.414
There you go, right
on the stitch there.

15:37.458 --> 15:39.155
Two fingers on it.

15:39.199 --> 15:41.592
Then at the end, you
flick your wrist.Like that?

15:41.636 --> 15:44.247
There you go.
Give her a shot.

15:44.291 --> 15:46.728
Hey! How about that?

15:46.771 --> 15:50.123
Right? Just like a
pro, I'm telling you.

15:50.166 --> 15:52.299
Well, we'll work
on that, shall we?

15:52.342 --> 15:54.388
Definitely.

15:56.520 --> 15:57.695
