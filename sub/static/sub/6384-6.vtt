 Well, then why do the research?
         Just print the legend.

Hmm. Well, I've known the guy   
for like six weeks now,

And the only genuine moment     
  I've had with him             

14:01.474 --> 14:03.609
Is when he told me about this   
woman that he never got over    

14:03.643 --> 14:05.110
    And a mustang               
that wouldn't go in reverse.

That's why I was snooping       
around your house today.        

14:07.580 --> 14:09.481
  I think you'd have better luck
        finding the mustang.
