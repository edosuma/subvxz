WEBVTT

00:39.597 --> 00:41.033
Tap out, tap out!

00:50.076 --> 00:51.509
Bit in the head.

00:52.244 --> 00:54.579
Get it, three, two, one, go.

00:54.612 --> 00:55.547
Freeze now!

00:55.580 --> 00:56.681
Hey, let me see your hands!

00:56.715 --> 00:59.018
On the ground, on the ground,
on your faces right now!

00:59.051 --> 00:59.952
Tex, Biggs!

01:00.953 --> 01:04.256
What you got, what you
be still fighting, huh?

01:04.290 --> 01:05.257
Get down!

01:05.291 --> 01:07.126
We're not with him!
We don't even know him!

01:07.159 --> 01:08.760
They just hired us,
they just hired us

01:08.793 --> 01:10.062
for some stupid dance wrestling.

01:10.096 --> 01:11.163
Sir, just let us go.

01:11.197 --> 01:12.797
We just met them
today, I swear.

01:12.831 --> 01:15.067
Get your stuff and get out.

01:15.101 --> 01:17.635
Keep your hands
right up there, boy!

01:17.669 --> 01:18.803
Get out!

01:18.837 --> 01:21.007
- Tex.
- One locked door.

01:24.310 --> 01:26.212
All right listen up in there!

01:26.245 --> 01:27.812
You do not wanna
take a shot at me.

01:27.846 --> 01:28.880
I am heavily armed

01:28.913 --> 01:31.816
and I will turn this place
into the O.K. Corral!

01:31.916 --> 01:32.985
Speak up!

01:33.019 --> 01:35.287
I got a nine, I'm
putting it down.

01:36.255 --> 01:38.690
Hands, hands, hands!
Behind your neck.

01:38.723 --> 01:41.659
Behind your neck,
behind your neck.

01:42.861 --> 01:45.897
Take him to the front
with the others.

02:18.230 --> 02:21.167
Should I
call Detroit PD, sir?

02:21.200 --> 02:22.334
No, not yet.

02:22.368 --> 02:25.304
I know a woman in the suburbs
who runs a no kill shelter.

02:25.337 --> 02:27.973
Get the dogs out of here first
then we call PD.

02:28.007 --> 02:29.141
Hoo rah.

02:29.175 --> 02:30.943
Get his ass up.

02:35.247 --> 02:38.817
You stole a dog.
A rich man's dog.

02:38.850 --> 02:40.919
Rich men don't like
having their dog stolen.

02:40.953 --> 02:43.289
Paid us good money
to track you down.

02:44.957 --> 02:46.624
I'll give it back.

02:46.658 --> 02:48.827
Yeah you will.
You definitely will.

02:48.860 --> 02:50.895
But there's a price
you gotta pay.

02:50.930 --> 02:54.732
See I don't like dog fighters.

02:55.301 --> 02:57.069
You like dog fighters, Tex?

02:57.103 --> 02:58.903
I do not.

02:59.004 --> 03:00.805
Biggs, hold my weapon.

03:01.407 --> 03:04.676
Just so you can never say
that I sucker punched you.

03:04.709 --> 03:06.678
I'm about to beat your ass.

03:14.719 --> 03:16.155
Come on, Cap.

03:18.958 --> 03:20.758
Showed him that.

03:20.792 --> 03:22.261
Just like I taught
him when he was a boy.

03:22.294 --> 03:24.863
Yeah just like
you taught me, sir.

03:24.896 --> 03:27.933
Listen,
I want the names

03:27.967 --> 03:30.069
and addresses of every
single dog fighter

03:30.102 --> 03:32.171
in every house in this city.

03:32.204 --> 03:33.205
You're not a cop.

03:33.239 --> 03:33.905
Oh no.

03:33.939 --> 03:35.207
Tex, we got any coke in the car?

03:35.241 --> 03:37.143
- A whole lot of it.
- Yeah, bring it in.

03:37.176 --> 03:39.111
Bring in enough for
a life sentence.

05:48.440 --> 05:49.575
Ooh, let's get some horses in
the background.

05:49.608 --> 05:51.944
Oh my gosh, we have to have
the horse in the background.

05:51.977 --> 05:53.878
The horse in this one.

05:53.911 --> 05:54.912
- Cheese.
- Yes!

05:54.947 --> 05:56.282
That was perfect.

06:07.326 --> 06:08.427
Keep it balanced.

06:08.460 --> 06:10.296
Very good, very good.

06:11.397 --> 06:13.332
Smile, birthday girl.

06:14.967 --> 06:16.602
Yeah, you wanna look
good for your boyfriend.

06:16.635 --> 06:17.569
Bombshell shot.

06:17.603 --> 06:19.038
Stop, he's not my boyfriend.

06:19.071 --> 06:20.272
I've never even met him.

06:20.306 --> 06:22.174
Love at first sight.

06:23.609 --> 06:25.544
Don't worry, Joanna,
I'll have her home by six.

06:25.577 --> 06:26.545
Promise.

06:26.578 --> 06:27.713
Not worried at all,

06:27.746 --> 06:29.847
I'm just glad you could take
the girls to the stables.

06:29.881 --> 06:31.350
I think she's a natural.

06:31.383 --> 06:33.319
Allison's been
wanting that for years.

06:33.352 --> 06:36.221
So, how goes the
surprise party planning?

06:36.255 --> 06:39.425
Well, since you were able
to get them out of the house,

06:39.458 --> 06:41.260
I was able to make some calls.
It's gonna be fun.

06:41.293 --> 06:42.594
Okay, I'll see you in a bit.

06:42.628 --> 06:44.596
Time to dehorse your daughter.

06:44.630 --> 06:47.599
bye.

06:50.502 --> 06:52.304
Great job, Allison.

06:52.338 --> 06:53.838
Sarah, you're up.

06:56.342 --> 06:57.609
He's a hottie.

06:58.644 --> 07:00.379
Cheating on Tyler already.

07:00.412 --> 07:02.114
I'm turning 16 tomorrow

07:02.147 --> 07:05.351
so I'm not gonna be
this young forever.

07:18.397 --> 07:19.365
Afternoon, John.

07:19.398 --> 07:21.033
Maggie.

07:21.066 --> 07:22.234
How'd it go, Captain?

07:22.267 --> 07:25.237
Everybody gather
around the table.

07:38.717 --> 07:40.419
Aaron, you joining us?

07:40.452 --> 07:41.286
No.

07:43.288 --> 07:45.324
All right, Detroit PD
called every single one

07:45.357 --> 07:46.959
of those animal abusers.

07:46.992 --> 07:48.026
Well done, team.

07:51.263 --> 07:52.598
Hey Captain, don't forget.

07:52.631 --> 07:54.933
You bird dogged those
losers for six weeks now.

07:54.967 --> 07:57.236
We all thought it was gonna
be a dead end, remember?

07:57.269 --> 07:59.037
Sixth sense, I was
thinking like a dog.

08:01.974 --> 08:03.409
All right, I also
hooked Detroit PD

08:03.442 --> 08:06.512
into two other dog
rings, both local.

08:06.545 --> 08:09.381
Okay, all the names, phone
numbers, addresses, everything.

08:09.415 --> 08:10.616
So that's big, well done, guys.

08:10.649 --> 08:15.421
All right.

08:15.454 --> 08:18.991
And, our employer
gave us a nice fat tip

08:19.024 --> 08:20.692
so it's steak dinners on me.

08:25.364 --> 08:26.999
Hey, you want
me to do the drive

08:27.032 --> 08:28.434
to Cleveland tomorrow
on that Simpson matter?

08:28.467 --> 08:30.602
Now that the dog case
is closed and all?

08:30.636 --> 08:32.438
I can handle it, John.

08:32.471 --> 08:33.672
I don't mean any disrespect.

08:33.705 --> 08:35.107
Well it is disrespectful.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.707
But my case is closed.

08:36.741 --> 08:38.309
So you think you
should take my case?

08:38.342 --> 08:41.447
I think there's a missing
boy and I'm available.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.615
John, I can handle it.

08:43.649 --> 08:45.517
That's why I hired you, Karen.

08:45.551 --> 08:48.053
Tex, you'll get lead on
another case real soon.

08:48.086 --> 08:51.223
Hey, you give the
orders, I just follow.

08:51.256 --> 08:53.759
What are we at now, 90 hours?

08:53.792 --> 08:54.660
96.

08:55.561 --> 08:57.296
Aaron, how we doing?

08:59.364 --> 09:02.601
Hey yo pencil neck, the
lady's talking to you.

09:02.634 --> 09:04.470
Oh that's hysterical.

09:04.503 --> 09:09.174
You must be the funniest
guy in your GED program.

09:09.208 --> 09:11.043
Boy, I'm educated
in all kind of stuff

09:11.076 --> 09:13.011
that you don't
know nothin' about.

09:13.045 --> 09:14.746
Anything about.

09:14.780 --> 09:17.783
Obviously English is not
one of your strong suits.

09:17.816 --> 09:19.384
Well I tell you
what, I'm educated

09:19.418 --> 09:22.254
in Greco-Roman wrestling
and western boxing.

09:22.287 --> 09:23.755
So how you like that, chump?

09:23.789 --> 09:25.657
Boys, I don't want any
of that in this office,

09:25.691 --> 09:27.226
do you hear me?

09:27.259 --> 09:28.227
It leads to arguing.

09:28.260 --> 09:29.228
Arguing leads to cussing

09:29.261 --> 09:32.197
and cussing leads to blasphemy.

09:32.231 --> 09:33.332
Yes, ma'am.

09:33.365 --> 09:34.533
Good.

09:34.566 --> 09:37.102
Aaron, how we doing
on finding that boy?

09:42.641 --> 09:44.776
I cracked all of his
passwords fast enough.

09:44.810 --> 09:47.279
I thought I had a lead that
would send us straight to him

09:47.312 --> 09:48.480
but it didn't pan out.

09:48.514 --> 09:51.149
Had to widen the gap.
Need more time.

09:51.183 --> 09:52.451
How long have you
been on that computer?

09:52.484 --> 09:53.318
17 hours.

09:53.352 --> 09:56.121
Hey, you need
dinner and some sleep.

09:56.154 --> 09:57.556
I've got frozen
pizzas in the fridge.

09:57.589 --> 09:59.291
And a lot of soda.

09:59.324 --> 10:03.161
I can lock in and go 72
hours when I have to.

10:04.296 --> 10:05.497
Go to dinner.

10:05.531 --> 10:10.302
I'll tell you meatheads what
door to kick down soon enough.

10:11.169 --> 10:12.271
Well dinner's on you, boss.

10:12.304 --> 10:13.839
I already said that.

10:13.872 --> 10:16.241
Yeah, just getting
it for the record.

10:16.275 --> 10:17.809
Well, let's do it.

10:28.153 --> 10:29.821
Hey yo, pencil neck.

10:30.856 --> 10:33.191
You doing all right, 'cuz.

10:35.160 --> 10:38.130
My man.

10:48.340 --> 10:50.242
Allison has a boyfriend.

10:50.275 --> 10:51.109
Really?

10:51.143 --> 10:52.110
Grow up.

10:52.144 --> 10:53.579
Honey, do you think
you could enjoy dinner

10:53.612 --> 10:54.580
without texting for

10:54.613 --> 10:55.581
- 10 minutes?
- Mom!

10:55.614 --> 10:56.582
Hang on a sec.

10:56.615 --> 10:58.350
Oh, yeah, I'm hanging.

10:58.383 --> 10:59.818
Listen to your mother.

10:59.851 --> 11:02.721
You can continue your love
affair after dinner, okay?

11:02.754 --> 11:04.823
Oh sure, Dad speaks
and you listen.

11:04.856 --> 11:07.826
I ask nicely and
it's "Hang on a sec."

11:07.859 --> 11:08.827
He's the man.

11:08.860 --> 11:10.395
Ooh.

11:10.429 --> 11:11.697
Who teaches them
this kind of stuff?

11:11.730 --> 11:13.332
We have a progressive home.

11:13.365 --> 11:16.735
How'd these teenage girls
succumb to these norms?

11:16.768 --> 11:18.370
You know, I just
think Rachel's jelly

11:18.403 --> 11:20.372
because she doesn't
have a boyfriend.

11:20.405 --> 11:22.174
Mhmm, and she's too young.

11:22.207 --> 11:23.308
Whatever.

11:23.342 --> 11:24.743
I don't wanna date
some middle school boy.

11:24.776 --> 11:26.478
Next year I'll be a freshman

11:26.511 --> 11:28.680
and I'll get a football
playing senior.

11:28.714 --> 11:30.182
Oh, fantastic.

11:36.321 --> 11:38.357
Hey, Tyler.

11:38.390 --> 11:39.491
Hey beautiful.

11:39.524 --> 11:40.826
I thought you'd never be online.

11:40.859 --> 11:41.793
I miss you.

11:43.795 --> 11:47.232
We just
talked last night, silly.

11:47.265 --> 11:50.636
I wanna
meet you so bad.

11:50.669 --> 11:52.838
Me too.

11:52.871 --> 11:55.173
Meet me tonight.

11:57.275 --> 12:00.445
I have
school tomorrow.

12:00.479 --> 12:01.513
Just for a little bit.

12:01.546 --> 12:03.482
I promise I'll be good.

12:15.928 --> 12:16.762
Tyler?

12:16.795 --> 12:17.663
Hey.

12:17.696 --> 12:18.530
Hi.

12:18.563 --> 12:19.665
Where are we going?

12:19.698 --> 12:21.466
You'll see.

13:13.719 --> 13:14.720
No please!

13:15.955 --> 13:16.989
Keep moving!

13:17.023 --> 13:17.923
Stop, no.

13:22.427 --> 13:23.895
No, no!

13:23.930 --> 13:24.796
Stop!

13:24.830 --> 13:25.697
Shut up.

13:26.966 --> 13:29.835
Y'all hoes get
back in your cages.

13:35.540 --> 13:36.708
Please let me go.

13:36.742 --> 13:38.410
Please let me go!

13:38.443 --> 13:40.512
I own you now.

13:40.545 --> 13:43.415
And you ain't never
going nowhere.

14:12.945 --> 14:14.312
Honey, can you
go tell your sister

14:14.346 --> 14:15.647
that breakfast is almost ready?

14:15.680 --> 14:17.883
Hold on, let me post
something real quick.

14:17.916 --> 14:20.052
Now, young lady, please.

14:23.089 --> 14:24.856
Hey, breakfast is almost done.

14:24.890 --> 14:26.825
Ah, just coffee for
me, hon, I gotta run.

14:26.858 --> 14:29.594
But you missed it yesterday.

14:29.628 --> 14:31.396
Oh, I gotta close
this deal, babe.

14:31.429 --> 14:32.731
We need the money.

14:32.764 --> 14:33.899
That's true.

14:35.433 --> 14:37.803
All right, do you have
time for a good luck kiss?

14:37.836 --> 14:38.703
Always.

14:50.116 --> 14:50.983
Allison?

14:56.122 --> 14:57.923
She isn't there, Mom.

14:57.957 --> 14:59.457
What?

14:59.491 --> 15:01.827
No, it's still early.

15:01.860 --> 15:04.096
Come on, Joanna,
it's her birthday.

15:04.130 --> 15:07.365
She just probably snuck out
early to be with friends.

15:07.399 --> 15:09.035
Sweet 16, big day.

15:09.068 --> 15:11.503
You remember what that was like.

15:11.536 --> 15:13.105
Yes, 100 years ago.

15:13.139 --> 15:14.941
Wish me luck, old girl.

15:14.974 --> 15:16.775
All right, old man.

15:43.702 --> 15:45.972
Y'all did good last night.

15:50.176 --> 15:52.510
Thank you, Daddy.

15:52.544 --> 15:54.013
Now y'all have some candy

15:54.046 --> 15:56.082
and get you a good sleep.

15:59.918 --> 16:01.988
Don't put you in no cages.

16:03.089 --> 16:05.157
You gonna come back
and see me later?

16:05.191 --> 16:07.692
Oh yeah, baby girl.

16:07.726 --> 16:10.862
Just gotta break in this
new girl right quick.

16:14.033 --> 16:16.102
Let one of the
other guys do it.

16:16.135 --> 16:18.170
Bitch, shut up
telling me my business.

16:18.204 --> 16:19.939
Lucky I don't beat your ass.

16:19.972 --> 16:23.742
Just take your candy
and go to sleep.

16:23.775 --> 16:26.645
Maybe tomorrow I don't
give you no candy.

16:26.678 --> 16:27.646
You feel me?

16:27.679 --> 16:28.847
No, please!

16:28.880 --> 16:31.917
Bitch shut up and
get in your cage!

16:43.029 --> 16:46.098
First day of school, white girl.

16:56.808 --> 16:57.876
This is moi weird.

16:57.909 --> 16:59.544
She hasn't texted me all day.

16:59.577 --> 17:00.512
Same here.

17:00.545 --> 17:01.680
You think she's playing sick?

17:01.713 --> 17:02.647
On her birthday, no,

17:02.681 --> 17:05.217
that would be social suicide.

17:05.251 --> 17:06.917
Ugh, my phone is vibrating.

17:06.953 --> 17:09.688
Who calls anyone anymore?

17:09.721 --> 17:11.522
OMG, it's her mom.

17:11.556 --> 17:12.824
Should I answer it?

17:12.857 --> 17:13.791
Um, yeah.

17:16.127 --> 17:18.730
Hi, Mrs. R, is Allison okay?

17:24.602 --> 17:25.804
Not a peepster.

17:29.075 --> 17:29.942
Copy that.

17:30.977 --> 17:32.510
That girl is MIA.

17:34.746 --> 17:36.581
Man, you right about her.

17:36.614 --> 17:40.618
Dude, she gonna make us
a lot of money for real.

17:41.287 --> 17:42.687
I'm about to go again.

17:42.721 --> 17:43.555
No.

17:43.588 --> 17:44.556
What?

17:44.589 --> 17:45.757
Go get you one
them other hoes.

17:45.790 --> 17:47.026
What?

17:47.059 --> 17:49.228
You heard what I said.

17:49.261 --> 17:51.863
Man, come on, for real?

17:51.896 --> 17:52.764
Come on.

17:54.233 --> 17:57.937
Do that thing that
you know I like.

17:59.604 --> 18:00.272
Please.

18:05.177 --> 18:06.578
Please, Mister.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.682
If you let me go home,

18:10.715 --> 18:13.785
I promise I won't tell anyone.

18:13.818 --> 18:16.521
My name is Daddy, not Mister.

18:17.189 --> 18:18.057
Daddy.

18:19.125 --> 18:21.893
And you ain't never
going nowhere.

18:34.173 --> 18:35.941
Have some candy.

18:35.975 --> 18:37.809
Make you feel better.

19:03.202 --> 19:04.203
Rose, it's not like her.

19:04.236 --> 19:05.837
Not a single text.

19:05.870 --> 19:07.339
Well, she's 16 today.

19:07.373 --> 19:09.841
Maybe she's with
her new boyfriend.

19:09.874 --> 19:11.377
What new boyfriend?

19:11.410 --> 19:12.945
Tyler.

19:12.978 --> 19:14.213
I saw a picture
of him yesterday.

19:14.246 --> 19:15.114
Cute kid.

19:16.248 --> 19:18.084
She never told me.

19:18.117 --> 19:19.684
Well, you're her mother, J.

19:19.717 --> 19:20.885
It's a teenager's
first prerogative

19:20.919 --> 19:24.223
to keep stuff from
parental units.

19:26.791 --> 19:27.659
Hello?

19:28.860 --> 19:32.064
Hey hon, I just
sold the Miller place.

19:32.098 --> 19:33.332
Done deal.

19:33.365 --> 19:36.168
Case, Allison's missing.

19:36.202 --> 19:37.937
What do
you mean missing?

19:37.970 --> 19:39.671
I mean I haven't heard
a single text from her,

19:39.704 --> 19:41.006
none of her friends
have heard from her

19:41.040 --> 19:42.374
and I'm scared.

19:42.408 --> 19:44.742
Honey,
it's her sweet 16.

19:44.776 --> 19:45.877
She's out with her friends.

19:45.910 --> 19:47.279
Look, just calm down.

19:47.313 --> 19:50.116
I'll be home in 10 minutes.

19:50.149 --> 19:51.850
Betcha she walks
through that door

19:51.883 --> 19:54.286
any minute with that new boy.

19:54.320 --> 19:58.424
If I win, you're in to
me for martinis at Al's.

19:58.457 --> 20:01.127
That's a bet I'd gladly lose.

20:09.335 --> 20:11.003
Look, why don't we
give her another hour?

20:11.036 --> 20:12.304
No.

20:12.338 --> 20:14.974
Joanna, try to relax, dear.

20:15.007 --> 20:16.908
I can't, Mom, my
daughter's missing.

20:16.942 --> 20:18.743
We don't know that yet.

20:18.776 --> 20:21.947
I can feel it in my heart,
something's terribly wrong.

20:21.981 --> 20:23.015
All her best friends are here,

20:23.048 --> 20:24.150
she didn't go to school.

20:24.183 --> 20:27.052
No text, no post, nothing.

20:27.086 --> 20:28.887
I hope she's okay.

20:31.056 --> 20:31.923
Okay.

20:34.026 --> 20:35.660
I'll make the call.

20:38.297 --> 20:40.132
Okay folks, I'm sorry.

20:41.400 --> 20:45.070
Obviously Allison has
been missing all day.

20:45.104 --> 20:47.306
My wife's a little upset so

20:48.474 --> 20:49.841
I think we're gonna
call it an evening.

20:49.874 --> 20:51.776
Thanks so much for coming out.

20:51.809 --> 20:54.079
We'll reschedule all of this.

20:55.114 --> 20:57.349
But thanks, thanks so much.

20:57.383 --> 20:59.451
Yeah, right inside there.

21:03.422 --> 21:04.990
It'll be okay, Mrs. R.

21:05.024 --> 21:07.792
Allison can be a
bit crazy sometimes.

21:07.825 --> 21:09.361
She'll be home soon.

21:29.215 --> 21:31.984
And she hasn't called all day?

21:32.017 --> 21:33.519
That's right.

21:33.552 --> 21:34.954
No emails, no texts.

21:34.987 --> 21:36.989
Nothing, just silence.

21:38.890 --> 21:41.393
She have a boyfriend?

21:42.528 --> 21:45.998
Well I heard this
morning that she does.

21:46.031 --> 21:46.864
What?

21:46.898 --> 21:48.200
And how did you
learn about this?

21:48.234 --> 21:49.767
Does it matter?

21:49.801 --> 21:53.272
Joanna, let's just answer
the questions please.

21:54.206 --> 21:57.009
I heard from my best friend

21:57.042 --> 22:00.512
who happens to be her
best friend's mother.

22:00.546 --> 22:03.315
Do you have
the boyfriend's number?

22:03.349 --> 22:05.484
No, like I said,
I just found out

22:05.517 --> 22:07.553
that she has a boyfriend.

22:07.586 --> 22:08.920
I don't know anything.

22:08.954 --> 22:10.489
Can we do something
more proactive?

22:10.522 --> 22:13.025
Do you know
the boy's name, ma'am?

22:13.058 --> 22:15.995
Trent or Trevor or something.

22:16.028 --> 22:19.098
We can call Rose and ask her.

22:19.131 --> 22:20.266
Well Mrs.
Riley, your daughter

22:20.299 --> 22:23.202
hasn't been missing
a full day yet.

22:23.235 --> 22:25.371
Is it possible she's
off with this Trevor,

22:25.404 --> 22:29.275
Trent, Thomas guy and they're
off partying someplace?

22:29.308 --> 22:31.277
And you know, just being kids?

22:31.310 --> 22:32.311
No, it isn't.

22:32.344 --> 22:33.312
Joanna.

22:33.345 --> 22:35.014
What?

22:35.047 --> 22:37.016
Yes, it's possible, officers.

22:37.049 --> 22:38.384
Look, whose side are you on?

22:38.417 --> 22:41.819
There aren't any
sides here, Jo.

22:41.853 --> 22:44.423
Your daughter
has run away before, Ma'am.

22:44.456 --> 22:47.426
No, my daughter's
never run away.

22:47.459 --> 22:49.894
Two years ago, you filed
a missing persons report-

22:49.928 --> 22:51.563
- No, she was at a sleepover

22:51.597 --> 22:53.532
and she came home
the next morning.

22:53.565 --> 22:56.435
So we'll just
give it a little time.

22:56.468 --> 22:58.604
Look, my daughter's missing!

22:58.637 --> 22:59.904
I know her.

22:59.938 --> 23:01.040
There's something terribly wrong

23:01.073 --> 23:03.942
and you guys are
just sitting there!

23:08.280 --> 23:11.116
What do you guys
suggest we do?

23:11.150 --> 23:12.584
Just give
it a little time, sir.

23:12.618 --> 23:15.554
These things, they normally
work themselves out.

23:15.587 --> 23:17.389
And if they don't?

23:17.423 --> 23:19.491
If she's still
missing after 48 hours,

23:19.525 --> 23:20.892
give us a call.

23:20.925 --> 23:23.062
We'll come back,
we'll file a report.

23:23.095 --> 23:24.463
Try to get the boyfriend's name,

23:24.496 --> 23:25.964
see if you can track
down his phone number.

23:25.998 --> 23:28.133
- Can you do that?
- Mhmm.

23:29.901 --> 23:34.173
They should be
easy enough for us to find.

23:35.441 --> 23:37.343
All right guys,
thanks for coming out.

23:37.376 --> 23:39.278
Our pleasure, sir.

23:39.311 --> 23:41.447
- Good night, ma'am.
- Something's wrong.

23:41.480 --> 23:42.581
Good night, sir.

23:42.614 --> 23:43.848
Good night.

23:48.053 --> 23:50.489
I'm gonna ground that girl for a
week when she gets back.

23:50.522 --> 23:52.458
Don't you mean if
she shows up, Case?

23:52.491 --> 23:55.461
She hasn't texted
me either, Mom.

23:55.494 --> 23:57.129
Case, she's missing.

23:57.162 --> 23:58.530
All right.

23:58.564 --> 23:59.998
Don't scare her.

24:01.133 --> 24:04.236
You're just standing there!

24:04.269 --> 24:06.505
Rachel, go to bed.

24:06.538 --> 24:07.373
But I...

24:07.406 --> 24:08.607
Now.

24:08.640 --> 24:09.508
Scoot.

24:14.713 --> 24:15.581
Okay.

24:17.483 --> 24:20.319
I'm gonna check all
the hospitals, okay?

24:20.352 --> 24:23.122
You keep calling her friends.

24:23.155 --> 24:24.223
Okay if we don't
find her tonight

24:24.256 --> 24:26.492
I'll call Mike and Justin

24:26.525 --> 24:29.128
and first thing in the morning
we'll jump in our cars,

24:29.161 --> 24:31.397
we'll check out all the places
where the kids hang out.

24:31.430 --> 24:32.398
Yeah.

24:32.431 --> 24:33.532
Tomorrow's Saturday.

24:33.565 --> 24:36.001
We'll look all
weekend if we have to.

24:36.034 --> 24:38.237
We'll track down this Trevor guy

24:38.270 --> 24:41.073
who I'm going to
kill by the way.

24:43.175 --> 24:45.711
Listen, Allison will
be back in our house

24:45.744 --> 24:47.946
by Sunday at the latest.

24:49.181 --> 24:50.048
Okay?

25:01.493 --> 25:02.361
Oh.

25:04.062 --> 25:04.930
Mom.

25:18.243 --> 25:19.311
Aight, bitches.

25:19.344 --> 25:21.647
Grab your coats and let's go.

25:21.680 --> 25:25.350
Hurry up, we got paying
customers in there.

25:44.136 --> 25:46.238
It's work time now, girl.

25:46.271 --> 25:49.107
I suppose you're
thinking about running.

25:49.141 --> 25:50.676
Maybe you're thinking
about asking one of them

25:50.709 --> 25:52.544
nice white boys for help.

25:52.578 --> 25:55.714
Or doing something stupid
like calling the police.

25:55.747 --> 25:56.615
Don't.

25:57.616 --> 25:58.750
You see this?

26:07.526 --> 26:09.528
That your sister, right?

26:10.629 --> 26:12.531
You mess with me and she next.

26:12.564 --> 26:13.632
No, please.

26:15.534 --> 26:17.269
Oh she pretty too.

26:19.805 --> 26:21.173
I'll be good.

26:23.442 --> 26:25.677
You're in room 45.

26:25.711 --> 26:28.614
I'll be out here the whole time.

26:28.647 --> 26:29.515
You got me

26:31.650 --> 26:33.252
and I got my nine.

26:36.321 --> 26:38.357
I got you, now.

26:38.390 --> 26:41.260
Ain't nobody gonna
hurt you, girl.

26:43.161 --> 26:44.029
Take this.

27:05.117 --> 27:05.784
Go on now.

27:06.718 --> 27:08.387
I'll be right here.

31:08.693 --> 31:09.594
Now what?

31:10.862 --> 31:13.065
Well, we go out
again tomorrow.

31:13.099 --> 31:16.802
And if 48 hours goes by,
we call the cops again

31:16.835 --> 31:19.671
and file a missing
persons report.

31:19.704 --> 31:20.572
And um...

31:22.108 --> 31:23.042
And what?

31:24.576 --> 31:25.811
Nothing.

31:25.844 --> 31:28.780
No, don't do
that, not right now.

31:30.382 --> 31:31.817
All right.

31:31.850 --> 31:32.985
I called Kessler.

31:33.019 --> 31:34.686
Oh god.

31:34.719 --> 31:36.788
Who's Kessler?

31:36.822 --> 31:38.490
Case's idiot
friend from college.

31:38.523 --> 31:39.691
He's a loser.

31:39.724 --> 31:41.393
He's actually
quite successful.

31:41.426 --> 31:43.996
He's a professional poker
player and he sells weed.

31:44.030 --> 31:47.934
He's one of those guys with a
22 year old bimbo girlfriend.

31:47.967 --> 31:50.102
Is any of that
relevant, Joanna?

31:50.136 --> 31:51.103
He knows people.

31:51.137 --> 31:52.404
Really?

31:52.437 --> 31:54.439
Who does he know, huh?

31:54.472 --> 31:57.375
Who does your pothead
poker playing friend know?

31:57.409 --> 31:58.410
Never mind.

31:58.443 --> 32:00.612
I didn't wanna get into it.

32:06.085 --> 32:08.553
Just tell me who he knows.

32:17.529 --> 32:19.999
Belton Private Investigators.

32:20.032 --> 32:23.735
Kessler says this PI,
John Belton and his crew

32:23.768 --> 32:26.504
will find Allison or die trying.

33:05.945 --> 33:06.811
John.

33:07.846 --> 33:10.582
You can't save every one of 'em.

33:16.088 --> 33:17.422
Sorry, guys.

33:20.592 --> 33:22.661
It wasn't your fault.

33:22.694 --> 33:25.830
You tracked the kid
down, you found him.

33:25.864 --> 33:27.133
That's your job.

33:30.735 --> 33:33.471
I couldn't have done any better.

33:51.656 --> 33:55.527
All we can do is get
back on that horse, boss.

34:01.100 --> 34:02.701
Belton Private Investigators.

34:02.734 --> 34:04.569
John Belton speaking.

34:10.009 --> 34:12.043
All right, Mr. Riley.

34:12.078 --> 34:15.246
How long has she been missing?

34:15.281 --> 34:18.083
Have you called the police?

34:21.954 --> 34:23.255
No, no, no, tomorrow
might be too late, okay?

34:23.289 --> 34:25.889
I'm sending my to investigator
out to speak to you.

34:25.924 --> 34:27.126
We'll conference on the speaker.

34:27.159 --> 34:29.860
Can I have your address please?

34:33.264 --> 34:34.132
Yes, sir.

34:37.601 --> 34:38.870
Clock's ticking.

35:01.327 --> 35:04.296
Hey, she
broke in well tonight.

35:04.330 --> 35:06.065
Have a seat, ladies.

35:10.970 --> 35:12.904
Honey, you done good.

35:14.806 --> 35:17.842
I know the first time's
always the toughest.

35:17.876 --> 35:19.045
Daddy?

35:19.078 --> 35:20.812
Huh, baby?

35:20.845 --> 35:23.681
Am I still your favorite?

35:23.715 --> 35:24.582
You is.

35:26.218 --> 35:27.153
You all is.

35:46.372 --> 35:48.706
John, she's 16.

35:48.740 --> 35:51.676
Blonde, 5'3, photos
are on the way.

35:52.710 --> 35:54.080
Okay, got it.

35:54.113 --> 35:55.680
Listen, Mr. And Mrs. Riley,

35:55.713 --> 35:57.283
the police won't consider
this a missing persons issue

35:57.316 --> 35:59.285
until 48 hours has elapsed.

35:59.318 --> 36:01.220
That means that if your
daughter does not return

36:01.253 --> 36:04.290
you will fill out the
necessary police report.

36:04.323 --> 36:06.025
Okay, got it.

36:06.058 --> 36:07.725
All right, Tex, go
up to the girl's room.

36:07.759 --> 36:08.961
Toss it.

36:08.994 --> 36:11.763
Mr. And Mrs. Riley, he's gonna
look for another cell phone,

36:11.796 --> 36:14.799
iPad, laptop, and
address book, a journal,

36:14.833 --> 36:15.935
anything like that.

36:15.968 --> 36:17.069
I'm on it, boss.

36:17.103 --> 36:18.370
I'll show you.

36:21.073 --> 36:22.241
Mrs. Riley.

36:22.274 --> 36:23.708
We're gonna do this
by the numbers, ma'am.

36:23.741 --> 36:24.944
Okay, my team and I
are gonna question

36:24.977 --> 36:27.012
everyone that Allison knows.

36:27.046 --> 36:29.281
You're in very good hands.

36:29.315 --> 36:31.383
Thank you, Mr. Belton.

36:31.417 --> 36:33.818
And call me John, please.

36:33.852 --> 36:34.987
I hope this doesn't happen

36:35.020 --> 36:37.689
but we may be together
for a little while.

36:37.722 --> 36:39.358
Well then no more Mrs. Riley.

36:39.391 --> 36:41.327
It's Joanna and Case.

36:41.360 --> 36:42.962
Okay, Joanna.

36:42.995 --> 36:45.197
Now I know the police may
have asked you this before

36:45.231 --> 36:46.932
but does your daughter
have any issues

36:46.966 --> 36:48.666
with drugs or alcohol?

36:48.700 --> 36:49.834
No.

36:49.868 --> 36:51.003
You're sure?

36:51.036 --> 36:53.038
Yeah, I mean I may have
missed with the boyfriend part

36:53.072 --> 36:54.873
but I know her really well.

36:54.906 --> 36:56.275
She's not into that.

36:56.308 --> 36:57.343
Okay.

36:57.376 --> 37:00.412
Any past psychological
issues, ADD,

37:00.446 --> 37:02.248
depression, anything like that?

37:02.281 --> 37:05.117
No, not at all,
she's a great girl.

37:05.151 --> 37:08.653
She's a sweetheart,
she's an angel, John.

37:09.355 --> 37:11.257
I'm sure she is, Joanna

37:11.290 --> 37:13.892
and we are gonna
find your angel.

37:13.925 --> 37:15.995
Do you promise?

37:22.468 --> 37:24.036
I promise.

37:24.069 --> 37:25.670
She will be found.

37:46.791 --> 37:48.793
Laptop, old cellphone.

37:51.197 --> 37:54.934
I'm sorry, what
was your name again?

37:54.967 --> 37:56.235
That is Aaron.

37:57.769 --> 37:59.405
Write down the
name of her horse.

37:59.438 --> 38:03.108
Any other pets, middle
name, best friends' names,

38:03.142 --> 38:05.211
favorite colors,
favorite numbers,

38:05.244 --> 38:08.846
celebrity crushes,
birthday, favorite holiday

38:08.880 --> 38:12.418
and everything else
that you can think of.

38:12.451 --> 38:16.788
Hey, he'll have her
passwords in 15 minutes.

38:16.821 --> 38:21.160
Me, I can barely find the
speaker button on my phone.

38:23.395 --> 38:24.530
How do you take your coffee?

38:24.563 --> 38:25.431
Hot.

38:32.171 --> 38:35.074
Look, we're gonna
find your daughter.

38:35.107 --> 38:36.741
This is what we do.

38:38.143 --> 38:39.011
John.

38:40.512 --> 38:43.915
How much is this gonna cost us?

38:43.949 --> 38:45.951
We're middle class.

38:45.985 --> 38:47.953
We're not rich.

38:47.987 --> 38:49.255
There's a standard
commencement retainer

38:49.288 --> 38:50.888
of 20,000 tonight.

38:52.224 --> 38:53.993
Even if she walks in that
door 10 minutes from now

38:54.026 --> 38:54.560
on her own.

38:54.593 --> 38:56.228
Whoah.

38:56.262 --> 38:57.129
Fine.

38:58.397 --> 39:01.533
And then it's 20k
a week after that.

39:01.567 --> 39:02.867
John, I don't know.

39:02.900 --> 39:03.768
Case.

39:06.838 --> 39:10.009
I'm just trying to
be practical, honey.

39:10.042 --> 39:12.044
We're talking about the
girls' college funds here.

39:12.077 --> 39:16.248
We don't need college if
we don't have our daughter.

39:16.282 --> 39:18.050
Maybe we should
just think about it.

39:18.083 --> 39:19.218
Let the police try.

39:19.251 --> 39:20.852
Look, sir.

39:20.885 --> 39:22.221
I'm not trying to
sell you on this,

39:22.254 --> 39:25.457
but the police, they're
just not gonna do anything.

39:25.491 --> 39:27.293
That's just the long
and short of it.

39:27.326 --> 39:30.129
Yeah, maybe she's
with this boyfriend.

39:30.162 --> 39:31.597
Are you sure?

39:31.630 --> 39:33.032
No.

39:33.065 --> 39:35.567
I'm not sure of anything now.

39:35.601 --> 39:37.902
And that is the hell of it.

39:37.936 --> 39:41.540
Maybe Allison is doing a
Juliet thing with her guy.

39:41.573 --> 39:43.808
But then again maybe not.

39:46.278 --> 39:49.181
Can we just have
time to think about it?

39:49.214 --> 39:50.582
Honestly sir,
every minute counts

39:50.616 --> 39:53.052
and we are on the clock.

39:53.085 --> 39:54.253
You want us to
find your daughter

39:54.286 --> 39:56.488
we need to start right now.

39:58.090 --> 39:59.857
I'll pay for it.

39:59.891 --> 40:01.493
Mom, your retirement.

40:01.527 --> 40:04.063
How can I retire
without my granddaughter?

40:04.096 --> 40:05.397
Barbara, we can't accept.

40:05.431 --> 40:07.933
You don't have to accept.

40:07.966 --> 40:10.202
Mr. Belton, you're hired.

40:10.235 --> 40:14.039
Computer nerd, keep
doing what you're doing.

40:14.073 --> 40:16.208
You, Cowboy, get
me the paperwork.

40:16.241 --> 40:17.042
Yes ma'am.

40:19.478 --> 40:21.313
You'll have your
money wired to you

40:21.347 --> 40:25.017
as soon as the bank
opens tomorrow morning.

40:25.684 --> 40:28.253
Find my granddaughter!

40:28.287 --> 40:29.154
I will.

40:31.256 --> 40:32.124
Mom.

40:43.635 --> 40:46.138
Where are you, pretty girl?

40:47.439 --> 40:51.243
I just hope it's not
where I'm afraid you are.

42:13.759 --> 42:17.463
Well, did you enjoy
church today, baby?

42:17.496 --> 42:18.630
It was cool.

42:19.631 --> 42:22.067
You're such a nice boy.

42:22.100 --> 42:24.002
You pick your grandma up,

42:24.036 --> 42:25.571
you take me to church.

42:25.604 --> 42:27.339
It ain't no thing.

42:28.707 --> 42:32.010
The Lord was good giving
me a grandchild like you.

42:32.044 --> 42:34.513
I told you, I got you, Grams.

42:41.253 --> 42:43.489
All right, honey.

42:56.568 --> 42:57.503
Yo Grams.

42:59.438 --> 43:03.275
I put a little something
in your purse for you.

43:04.776 --> 43:06.378
Oh, no, child!

43:06.411 --> 43:08.580
I can't take no money from you.

43:08.614 --> 43:10.148
I'll see you next week.

43:10.182 --> 43:12.384
Go on in there now.

43:12.417 --> 43:13.285
Bye.

43:14.386 --> 43:15.521
Drive careful.

43:35.173 --> 43:36.041
Okay.

43:37.175 --> 43:41.547
Our mission is one Allison
Riley, age 16 as of Friday.

43:41.580 --> 43:43.148
Now missing for almost 48 hours,

43:43.181 --> 43:46.685
she'll be an official
missing person as of tonight.

43:46.718 --> 43:49.154
Sweet little thing.

43:49.187 --> 43:50.422
No call from the
parents this morning?

43:50.455 --> 43:51.490
No, not so far.

43:51.523 --> 43:54.159
I am working on the supposition
that she is a taken.

43:54.192 --> 43:56.094
I'm betting I would say
she's with the boyfriend.

43:56.128 --> 43:57.496
Yeah, yeah, I know that but

43:57.529 --> 43:59.431
I just don't think so.

43:59.464 --> 44:00.832
That damn nose of
yours again, boss?

44:00.866 --> 44:02.401
It's a curse, but yeah.

44:02.434 --> 44:03.835
I got a bad feeling on this one.

44:03.869 --> 44:06.171
Aaron, tell them what you know.

44:06.204 --> 44:08.840
Her boyfriend Tyler is
a typical catfish profile.

44:08.874 --> 44:11.677
Tyler is actually Ryan Mcnaff.

44:11.710 --> 44:13.478
Professional model out of LA.

44:13.512 --> 44:16.715
All the photos were taken
from his various sites.

44:16.748 --> 44:18.717
The cellphone that was
used to text Allison

44:18.750 --> 44:21.853
went dark at 11:05
p.m. Friday night.

44:21.887 --> 44:24.556
And I presume it'll
never be turned on again.

44:24.590 --> 44:26.658
Trace down Tyler's cellphone.

44:26.692 --> 44:28.427
I'm guessing it's
prepaid with cash.

44:28.460 --> 44:30.395
We might get lucky.

44:30.429 --> 44:32.731
Okay, Karen, get in touch
with this Ryan Mcnaff

44:32.764 --> 44:34.299
out in California.

44:34.333 --> 44:36.134
The odds are overwhelming
that he has no idea

44:36.168 --> 44:37.569
any of this is going on.

44:37.603 --> 44:39.738
But make him prove to you that
he was in L.A. this weekend.

44:39.771 --> 44:40.806
Will do.

44:40.839 --> 44:42.341
All right, Maggie.

44:42.374 --> 44:44.843
The Rileys go to
church at Vineyard.

44:44.876 --> 44:46.511
And they have a lot
of friends there.

44:46.545 --> 44:47.346
Yeah, I know it.

44:47.379 --> 44:48.347
It's a nice place.

44:48.380 --> 44:49.748
All right, good.

44:49.781 --> 44:51.750
Well then make inquiries as
only you can, church lady.

44:51.783 --> 44:53.218
Oh, getting paid
to go to church.

44:53.251 --> 44:54.519
The Lord is good.

44:54.553 --> 44:55.420
Mhmm.

44:56.956 --> 44:59.424
All right Ben, hit the
high school tomorrow.

44:59.458 --> 45:01.159
See if you can get her
friends to tell you things

45:01.193 --> 45:02.527
that they won't
tell their parents.

45:02.561 --> 45:04.763
So you're telling me to
hit on high school girls?

45:04.796 --> 45:07.499
I'm telling you to
go there, be charming

45:07.532 --> 45:09.368
and then leave.

45:09.401 --> 45:11.670
Man, I want a case
at a college campus.

45:11.703 --> 45:13.238
Yeah, I bet you do.

45:13.271 --> 45:15.440
Biggs, head down to
the usual hotspots.

45:15.474 --> 45:18.343
See if you can get any
chatter out of the community.

45:18.377 --> 45:20.245
I'ma be working the
homies all day, Captain.

45:20.278 --> 45:22.247
Karen, when you're done
with that model in L.A.,

45:22.280 --> 45:24.249
hit up the various shops
and the street corners.

45:24.282 --> 45:26.284
See if the working
girls know anything.

45:26.318 --> 45:27.919
Why do I always
get hooker detail?

45:27.954 --> 45:31.189
What are we gonna
do, put heels on Ben now?

45:31.223 --> 45:34.159
Rookie.

45:37.896 --> 45:40.265
All right, Ben, you
actually go with her.

45:40.298 --> 45:41.700
Hang back but not too far.

45:41.733 --> 45:43.769
Her safety is
number one, got it?

45:43.802 --> 45:45.337
Yes sir.

45:45.370 --> 45:47.940
Now guys, if our little
girl here is a taken,

45:47.974 --> 45:50.275
every minute is an enemy.

45:51.443 --> 45:52.678
Okay, we're on the
clock, let's do this.

45:52.711 --> 45:53.578
Come on.

46:44.663 --> 46:46.698
Well, our brothers
and sisters in Christ,

46:46.732 --> 46:49.501
the Riley family are going
through a tough time right now.

46:49.534 --> 46:52.504
Many of you know that Allison's
been missing for some time.

46:52.537 --> 46:55.741
And we wanna pray for
God's healing and comfort

46:55.774 --> 46:58.443
to come in their lives
during this difficult season.

46:58.477 --> 46:59.644
So let's pray.

46:59.678 --> 47:03.415
Jesus, we ask that
you would be with our

47:03.448 --> 47:04.649
brothers and sisters.

47:04.683 --> 47:06.618
We pray that you
would comfort them

47:06.651 --> 47:08.887
during this difficult season.

47:08.920 --> 47:12.524
And we pray that you would
help to bring recovery

47:12.557 --> 47:15.527
for this young
woman who's missing.

47:16.661 --> 47:17.964
We pray Lord that
justice would come

47:17.997 --> 47:19.765
into this situation.

47:19.798 --> 47:22.501
Would you help and
bless and comfort

47:22.534 --> 47:23.869
and encourage this family,

47:23.902 --> 47:26.538
and help us Lord to be a
blessing of support to them.

47:26.571 --> 47:28.774
In your name we pray, amen.

47:54.866 --> 47:56.401
What's up, big man?

47:56.434 --> 47:57.536
Looking for a girl, cuz.

47:57.569 --> 47:58.703
Girl?

47:58.737 --> 48:00.338
You gotta tell me
what you want, man.

48:00.372 --> 48:02.507
White girl, about 16.

48:03.875 --> 48:04.743
Man.

48:04.776 --> 48:05.610
Oh she cute though.

48:05.644 --> 48:06.478
See that?

48:06.511 --> 48:07.679
She cool, bro.

48:07.712 --> 48:08.547
Yeah she nice.

48:08.580 --> 48:09.781
Yeah, she bangin, man.

48:09.815 --> 48:10.715
She a ho?

48:10.749 --> 48:11.917
Might be.

48:11.951 --> 48:13.418
A brother remember
a girl like that.

48:13.451 --> 48:14.619
Suburban girl.

48:14.653 --> 48:16.855
Suburban girl, of
course, of course.

48:16.888 --> 48:18.590
Yeah, that's why you be down
here slumming with us huh?

48:18.623 --> 48:20.392
That's why you be down
here all the time.

48:20.425 --> 48:21.459
Her daddy must be rich, huh?

48:21.493 --> 48:22.894
Huh, yeah, that's right.

48:22.929 --> 48:24.729
Hey, spread some of
that love around here.

48:24.763 --> 48:26.132
Share the wealth.

48:26.165 --> 48:29.101
Tell me where the girl at,
then you get paid, aight?

48:29.135 --> 48:31.403
I'll give you five Gs
you tell me where she at.

48:31.436 --> 48:34.840
I'll give you 10 Gs you
bring her to me, aight?

48:34.873 --> 48:36.075
All right man, I got your
phone.

48:36.108 --> 48:37.409
It's got to be verified,
aight?

48:37.442 --> 48:38.577
I got your phone.

48:38.610 --> 48:41.847
Aight, aight, aight, make
it happen for me, baby aight?

48:53.592 --> 48:55.894
The Detective handling this
matter will be Jack Carson.

48:55.927 --> 48:58.730
He's a good man, he
walked a beat in his day.

48:58.763 --> 49:00.099
That's fine.

49:00.132 --> 49:02.868
Yeah we hired a
private investigator too.

49:02.901 --> 49:05.637
Well that may have
been premature, sir.

49:05.670 --> 49:06.538
We didn't think so.

49:07.839 --> 49:09.875
Do you mind if I
asked who you engaged?

49:09.908 --> 49:10.909
John Belton.

49:14.646 --> 49:15.580
What?

49:15.614 --> 49:17.883
He seemed very professional.

49:17.916 --> 49:19.684
Professional?

49:19.718 --> 49:21.653
Officer
Helsdon, just..

49:22.754 --> 49:23.990
Wait, what about him?

49:25.091 --> 49:26.925
Well, he, let's just say

49:26.959 --> 49:29.494
he likes to work
outside the box.

49:29.527 --> 49:31.496
He's not exactly orthodox.

49:31.529 --> 49:33.798
We'll that sounds
exactly like what we need.

49:35.167 --> 49:37.702
We're gonna find your
daughter, Mrs. Riley.

49:37.736 --> 49:40.139
Now having John Belton talking
to the same people we are

49:40.172 --> 49:41.706
is only gonna get in our way.

50:01.826 --> 50:03.728
Unbelievable,
unbelievable.

50:10.802 --> 50:12.871
Case, what is that?

50:12.904 --> 50:13.738
What's what?

50:14.673 --> 50:16.708
That thing on your hip.

50:19.678 --> 50:20.912
It's a gun, Barbara.

50:20.947 --> 50:22.949
Please don't ask me
rhetorical questions.

50:22.982 --> 50:24.616
I don't have the energy for it.

50:28.054 --> 50:29.821
Why are you wearing it?

50:29.854 --> 50:30.822
Case.

50:32.992 --> 50:34.926
Because the second
amendment says I can

50:34.961 --> 50:36.128
so I am.

50:36.162 --> 50:37.796
Can we just leave it
at that and drop it?

50:37.829 --> 50:38.863
We're not gun people.

50:38.897 --> 50:40.699
Well I just became gun people.

50:42.034 --> 50:44.971
Do you have any
idea how many gun-related deaths

50:45.004 --> 50:46.571
there are in the US alone?

50:46.604 --> 50:48.040
Barbara, this
is not just some debate

50:48.074 --> 50:49.607
at one of your
liberal arts colleges.

50:49.641 --> 50:51.576
My daughter's missing.

50:51.609 --> 50:53.946
My
granddaughter is missing.

50:53.980 --> 50:56.082
Don't take that tone with me!

50:56.115 --> 50:56.949
Case.

50:59.085 --> 51:00.719
You have to see this.

51:00.752 --> 51:01.586
What?

51:01.619 --> 51:02.687
Captain John Belton,

51:02.721 --> 51:05.857
US Marine Corps,
dishonorable discharge.

51:05.890 --> 51:08.227
Says here he disobeyed
a direct order

51:08.260 --> 51:10.628
in the line of combat.

51:10.662 --> 51:12.031
He's been in and out of rehab

51:12.064 --> 51:14.066
for alcoholism three times!

51:14.100 --> 51:16.135
No wonder why your
friend Kessler knows him.

51:16.168 --> 51:17.836
None of that matters, Jo.

51:17.869 --> 51:19.238
He's looking for Allison.

51:19.271 --> 51:20.805
Is he?

51:20.839 --> 51:23.875
Or is he just drinking
away my money in some bar?

51:23.908 --> 51:25.211
Stay out of this, Barbara.

51:25.244 --> 51:27.046
Don't you tell me
to stay out of this.

51:27.079 --> 51:28.747
I'm paying the
bills around here.

51:28.780 --> 51:31.150
And strutting around
like John Wayne

51:31.183 --> 51:33.752
isn't doing anybody any good.

51:33.785 --> 51:36.721
Why would we trust
your friend Kessler, why?

51:36.755 --> 51:38.857
How the hell was
I supposed to know?

51:38.890 --> 51:40.592
This is all happening so fast!

51:40.625 --> 51:41.659
Where are you going?

51:41.693 --> 51:42.894
Out, looking!

51:42.927 --> 51:44.863
And standing around here
isn't doing us any good!

51:44.896 --> 51:46.065
Where?

51:46.098 --> 51:47.299
I don't know!

52:11.623 --> 52:12.992
Girls.

52:13.025 --> 52:14.626
Go to class.

52:14.659 --> 52:15.927
The bell hasn't rang yet.

52:16.996 --> 52:18.797
Sir, I'm a
private investigator

52:18.830 --> 52:20.099
- for John-
- One moment.

52:20.132 --> 52:21.067
Now, ladies.

52:22.767 --> 52:24.869
You're aware you have
a girl missing, Allison.

52:24.903 --> 52:26.338
Yes, I'm well aware.

52:26.372 --> 52:28.340
We're all well aware.

52:28.374 --> 52:31.377
That's why the city employs
a Police Department.

52:31.410 --> 52:34.113
We don't need wannabes
scaring the children.

52:34.146 --> 52:35.214
Wannabe?

52:35.247 --> 52:37.049
Sir, I served two tours of duty

52:37.083 --> 52:38.250
with the United States-

52:38.284 --> 52:41.619
- Yes, yes, yes, spare
me your resume, okay?

52:41.653 --> 52:42.854
Find your own way out.

52:46.125 --> 52:48.360
Let the police do their job.

53:01.140 --> 53:02.241
Just one guy tonight.

53:03.708 --> 53:04.376
You like that?

53:05.810 --> 53:08.047
Pay 1500 for three hours.

53:08.080 --> 53:09.814
Easy money.

53:09.848 --> 53:12.118
Just sit there, listen
to him talk about he job

53:12.151 --> 53:13.751
and all that nonsense.

53:16.855 --> 53:19.258
Ain't like them other
ones at the motel.

53:19.291 --> 53:21.926
He wants you to think
you he girlfriend, see?

53:21.961 --> 53:24.296
Do good and it stay like this.

53:25.131 --> 53:27.066
You act like a cheap ho,
you go back to the motel.

53:27.099 --> 53:29.801
10, 20 men a day
for a hundred a pop.

53:30.269 --> 53:31.137
Feel me?

53:33.973 --> 53:36.375
And remember, you don't
want me to come visit

53:36.408 --> 53:38.410
your little sister now, do you?

53:38.444 --> 53:40.812
No.

53:57.096 --> 53:58.364
Go on girl.

53:58.397 --> 53:59.797
Make Daddy proud.

54:14.213 --> 54:15.080
Honey.

54:16.315 --> 54:17.849
Try to get some sleep.

54:33.465 --> 54:34.333
- Hi.
- Hi.

54:40.838 --> 54:42.174
You really are beautiful.

54:44.310 --> 54:45.344
Want a glass of
wine, sweetheart?

54:45.377 --> 54:46.245
Thank you.

55:02.860 --> 55:03.728
You're hot.

55:05.397 --> 55:06.432
I mean, handsome.

55:09.401 --> 55:10.402
I'll take both.

55:17.309 --> 55:18.843
What's your name, angel?

55:18.876 --> 55:19.511
Allison.

55:45.237 --> 55:46.771
So, Allison.

55:48.873 --> 55:50.542
Tell me something
about yourself.

55:54.313 --> 55:55.314
I'm in vet school

55:56.348 --> 55:58.350
working specifically
with horses.

56:02.087 --> 56:02.920
Horses?

56:03.921 --> 56:04.957
Why horses?

56:06.558 --> 56:09.295
Right before my 16th birthday,

56:09.328 --> 56:10.929
I went riding with my friends

56:12.298 --> 56:14.866
and I knew right then that I
wanted to be a veterinarian.

56:18.504 --> 56:19.804
Brains and beauty.

56:25.010 --> 56:26.345
Wanna do me a favor, Allison?

56:29.448 --> 56:30.282
Sure.

56:33.986 --> 56:35.287
Take off that dress

56:35.321 --> 56:36.821
so we can go have some fun.

56:47.399 --> 56:50.336
Why don't you
take it off for me?

57:35.614 --> 57:36.648
Talk to me, John.

57:36.682 --> 57:39.485
I need to hear
something good, please.

57:39.518 --> 57:40.652
Just spoke to Ted Carson,

57:40.686 --> 57:42.421
the Detective on Allison's case.

57:42.454 --> 57:45.257
So we have the eyes of
Bloomfield Hills PD on this

57:45.290 --> 57:46.258
as well as us,

57:46.291 --> 57:47.659
but I'm gonna be
honest with you.

57:47.693 --> 57:50.362
The odds that she's still
in the suburbs are slim.

57:51.530 --> 57:53.132
I've made calls to my
friends at Detroit PD,

57:53.165 --> 57:54.933
they know about her
and they have her photo

57:54.967 --> 57:56.402
but honestly, they
are overwhelmed

57:56.435 --> 57:57.569
with their own problems.

57:58.971 --> 58:00.372
Is that it?

58:01.707 --> 58:03.675
Well I have a man on
the street in Detroit.

58:03.709 --> 58:06.378
Everybody knows him,
everybody respects him.

58:06.412 --> 58:07.513
The word is out to all the gangs

58:07.546 --> 58:11.650
that they can get 10 grand
if they find your daughter.

58:11.683 --> 58:13.085
Now Aaron is working
the computer.

58:13.118 --> 58:14.353
He hasn't found her yet.

58:15.721 --> 58:17.156
Sometimes the pimps-

58:17.189 --> 58:18.056
- Pimps?

58:22.060 --> 58:24.630
I'm sorry, Case, but
we have to face reality.

58:29.001 --> 58:30.669
Oh God in heaven.

58:30.702 --> 58:32.371
Maybe...

58:32.404 --> 58:34.273
Maybe you don't want
all the details.

58:37.409 --> 58:39.311
I want every detail, John.

58:40.212 --> 58:41.079
Go on.

58:44.249 --> 58:45.651
There haven't
been any escort ads

58:45.684 --> 58:48.587
that match any of the photos
from her social media sites.

58:48.620 --> 58:51.256
Aaron's run them all
through the computer.

58:51.290 --> 58:53.325
Okay next he's checking
for similar photos

58:53.358 --> 58:55.360
but that has to be done by hand

58:55.394 --> 58:57.162
and it takes a lot longer.

59:00.566 --> 59:01.366
Is that it?

59:02.501 --> 59:03.969
Well the noose is
tightening, Case.

59:05.103 --> 59:06.205
But that's all I have for now.

59:08.507 --> 59:09.641
Thank you, John.

59:10.676 --> 59:12.711
Hey, how is Joanna?

59:15.514 --> 59:19.051
Things at home
are not good, John.

59:20.319 --> 59:21.620
Okay, well that's normal.

59:23.121 --> 59:25.290
You two hang in there
now, you need each other.

59:26.625 --> 59:28.260
I know.

59:28.293 --> 59:29.161
Thank you, John.

59:31.063 --> 59:32.531
All right, we'll
talk tomorrow.

59:34.132 --> 59:35.000
Yeah.

01:00:23.749 --> 01:00:24.783
One week!

01:00:24.816 --> 01:00:27.419
One week, people
and we got zero.

01:00:27.452 --> 01:00:29.288
Zilch, nada, nothing, come on!

01:00:29.321 --> 01:00:30.856
It ain't unusual, boss.

01:00:30.889 --> 01:00:32.257
Yeah,
Captain, you know that.

01:00:32.291 --> 01:00:33.458
Yeah I know it,
but I don't like it.

01:00:33.492 --> 01:00:35.460
Okay usually there's some sort
of something in the ether,

01:00:35.494 --> 01:00:37.329
some chatter, some
talk on the streets.

01:00:37.362 --> 01:00:38.196
We got nothing.

01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:39.164
There will be, boss.

01:00:39.197 --> 01:00:40.599
There will be, sooner or later.

01:00:40.632 --> 01:00:42.301
Aaron!

01:00:42.334 --> 01:00:44.436
Searching social
media for any profiles

01:00:44.469 --> 01:00:45.837
using Tyler's picture.

01:00:45.871 --> 01:00:47.439
Nothing yet.

01:00:47.472 --> 01:00:50.542
Whoever this guy is that
lured Allison out is smart.

01:00:50.576 --> 01:00:52.244
But I'll find him!

01:00:52.277 --> 01:00:53.845
Yeah, you better find him.

01:00:53.879 --> 01:00:55.614
Karen, my office.

01:00:57.149 --> 01:00:57.783
Come on.

01:01:03.622 --> 01:01:05.090
Karen, get in here.

01:01:13.532 --> 01:01:16.735
$20,000 check from
the mother-in-law.

01:01:19.805 --> 01:01:20.706
What have you got?

01:01:20.739 --> 01:01:21.907
Nothing, not a peep.

01:01:21.941 --> 01:01:23.875
Our pros have heard
zero on our girl.

01:01:23.909 --> 01:01:25.844
Right, tomorrow you
start talking to everyone.

01:01:25.877 --> 01:01:26.712
Who?

01:01:26.745 --> 01:01:28.447
Everyone!

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:29.881
Okay, their kids
are gonna trust you.

01:01:29.915 --> 01:01:31.416
Her friends will trust you.

01:01:31.450 --> 01:01:32.918
I want you to call every
single phone number

01:01:32.952 --> 01:01:34.620
in her entire phone.

01:01:34.653 --> 01:01:35.821
Got it?

01:01:35.854 --> 01:01:37.456
Got it.

01:01:37.489 --> 01:01:38.357
Rookie, where's the rookie?

01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:39.558
Tell him to get in here.

01:01:40.459 --> 01:01:42.761
Yo, Benjamin, let's go!

01:01:42.794 --> 01:01:43.862
Front and center, son.

01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:45.864
Sir?

01:01:46.832 --> 01:01:48.667
All right, I want you
to coordinate with PD.

01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:49.735
I want you to give
me every location

01:01:49.768 --> 01:01:51.938
that every kid has been
picked up in the last year.

01:01:51.971 --> 01:01:53.338
Every single one.

01:01:53.372 --> 01:01:54.539
On it.

01:01:54.573 --> 01:01:55.874
Get me some leads,
people, let's go!

01:02:03.415 --> 01:02:04.916
You need to get
some sleep, Captain.

01:02:04.951 --> 01:02:06.885
Can't keep pulling
these all nighters.

01:02:08.286 --> 01:02:09.354
We ain't kids anymore.

01:02:10.756 --> 01:02:12.658
I can sleep when
I'm dead, partner.

01:02:17.529 --> 01:02:19.197
But I will take a cup of coffee.

01:02:24.903 --> 01:02:25.837
Where are you, kid?

01:02:38.283 --> 01:02:39.685
Everybody get up.

01:02:39.718 --> 01:02:41.553
We going for a ride.

01:02:41.586 --> 01:02:42.788
Ain't no working today.

01:03:10.016 --> 01:03:11.550
No, I don't know.

01:03:13.552 --> 01:03:15.687
I don't know.

01:03:16.621 --> 01:03:18.356
I gotta go okay, I love you.

01:03:19.891 --> 01:03:20.892
You did good.

01:03:24.429 --> 01:03:25.330
Allison, you up.

01:03:33.839 --> 01:03:35.307
Allison!

01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:36.008
Allison!

01:03:38.610 --> 01:03:39.478
Hi, Mom.

01:03:40.645 --> 01:03:41.513
Where are you?

01:03:42.814 --> 01:03:43.849
Everything's okay.

01:03:44.783 --> 01:03:49.021
Mom, I'm in Chicago with Tyler.

01:03:49.055 --> 01:03:51.023
Honey, just come home.

01:03:51.057 --> 01:03:52.824
We are not angry with you.

01:03:52.858 --> 01:03:54.259
Just please, come home.

01:04:00.933 --> 01:04:01.934
I have to go.

01:04:01.968 --> 01:04:02.801
Bye.

01:04:02.834 --> 01:04:03.635
What?

01:04:03.668 --> 01:04:05.470
No, Allison.

01:04:05.504 --> 01:04:07.006
Hello, Allison?

01:04:07.039 --> 01:04:08.074
No.

01:04:08.107 --> 01:04:09.041
- Allison?
- It's disconnected.

01:04:09.075 --> 01:04:10.609
- Allison!
- Call back.

01:04:13.612 --> 01:04:14.981
Hey there,
it's Allison's phone.

01:04:15.014 --> 01:04:15.914
- Oh my god.
- Dammit!

01:04:15.948 --> 01:04:18.683
- We traced her cellphone.
- Is that legal?

01:04:18.717 --> 01:04:20.719
No, it's not. Do you have a
problem with that?

01:04:20.752 --> 01:04:22.054
Not in the least, go on.

01:04:22.088 --> 01:04:24.389
And the call did
come from Chicago.

01:04:24.422 --> 01:04:26.358
Yeah she's in Chicago
with her boyfriend.

01:04:26.391 --> 01:04:27.093
Maybe.

01:04:27.126 --> 01:04:29.694
I hope so, but I don't think so.

01:04:30.862 --> 01:04:32.031
But she said that she was-

01:04:32.064 --> 01:04:33.933
- Joanna, please, just let,

01:04:33.966 --> 01:04:36.501
please, will you
just let him speak?

01:04:36.535 --> 01:04:38.971
The cellphone went dark
right after the call.

01:04:39.005 --> 01:04:42.975
Allison may have been coerced
into making that phone call.

01:04:43.009 --> 01:04:46.078
I'm sorry, but it's a
very real possibility.

01:04:46.112 --> 01:04:48.346
What?

01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:49.681
No, why, she wouldn't...

01:04:49.714 --> 01:04:51.083
- No.
- When these girls are taken,

01:04:51.117 --> 01:04:53.986
Joanna, the bad guys make
the kids call the parents.

01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:56.055
It's protocol to
throw off the police.

01:04:57.056 --> 01:04:58.057
I'm telling you, she's fine.

01:04:58.090 --> 01:05:00.492
She's in Chicago and she's okay.

01:05:00.525 --> 01:05:02.094
She's with her
boyfriend, she's okay.

01:05:02.128 --> 01:05:03.728
There is no boyfriend.

01:05:06.098 --> 01:05:07.066
What?

01:05:07.099 --> 01:05:08.834
At least there doesn't
seem to be a real Tyler.

01:05:08.867 --> 01:05:10.569
Those pictures are fake.

01:05:10.602 --> 01:05:13.438
They're from some
model in Los Angeles.

01:05:13.471 --> 01:05:15.473
The entire profile is a catfish.

01:05:16.875 --> 01:05:18.010
What?

01:05:18.044 --> 01:05:19.377
Whoever lured
your daughter out,

01:05:19.411 --> 01:05:20.112
that's not his name.

01:05:20.146 --> 01:05:21.513
Those are not his photos

01:05:21.546 --> 01:05:23.615
and he probably doesn't
even drive a Mustang.

01:05:25.851 --> 01:05:27.786
And when were you planning
to tell us all this?

01:05:27.819 --> 01:05:29.921
Mr. Riley, my job is
finding your daughter.

01:05:29.956 --> 01:05:32.724
You don't need every single
piece of information, sir.

01:05:32.757 --> 01:05:33.859
The hell I don't!

01:05:33.892 --> 01:05:35.694
I don't believe
anything you're saying.

01:05:35.727 --> 01:05:38.697
We know everything about
you, dishonorably discharged.

01:05:38.730 --> 01:05:41.566
Three times in rehab
for alcoholism.

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:42.767
Joanna.

01:05:42.801 --> 01:05:44.436
No, he's trying
to take our money,

01:05:44.469 --> 01:05:45.737
can't you see that?

01:05:45.770 --> 01:05:47.974
We should have just let
the cops handle this!

01:05:55.647 --> 01:05:56.848
Stay on it, John.

01:06:17.802 --> 01:06:20.106
These some high class
folks, little girls.

01:06:21.673 --> 01:06:24.176
Good old white boys having
theyselves a bachelor party.

01:06:26.678 --> 01:06:28.613
I want y'all to have
some fun tonight.

01:06:30.149 --> 01:06:31.583
Me and the boys be right here

01:06:31.616 --> 01:06:33.818
in case things get
out of control.

01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:37.489
Allison, you collecting
the money tonight.

01:06:37.522 --> 01:06:39.524
It be five Gs.

01:06:39.557 --> 01:06:40.993
Just keep this
under wraps, you know.

01:06:41.027 --> 01:06:43.895
What happens in the basement
stays in the basement.

01:06:43.930 --> 01:06:46.631
Aight, y'all go
get that white boy money.

01:06:46.665 --> 01:06:49.501
You know they daddies
gave them a lot of bread.

01:06:49.534 --> 01:06:50.202
Come get all that.

01:07:02.181 --> 01:07:03.715
Do good for Daddy.

01:08:14.719 --> 01:08:15.920
Y'all did good.

01:08:17.921 --> 01:08:19.058
Y'all made Daddy proud.

01:08:38.944 --> 01:08:40.712
20 grand a week, man.

01:08:40.745 --> 01:08:42.148
That's a lot of bread.

01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:43.349
Too much.

01:08:43.381 --> 01:08:44.816
Hey Biggs,
you know that girl

01:08:44.849 --> 01:08:45.683
you were looking for?

01:08:45.716 --> 01:08:46.651
Yeah, what up, Blink?

01:08:46.684 --> 01:08:48.187
I think I've
seen her man, for real.

01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:50.055
If she there, you
getting five Gs, homie.

01:08:50.089 --> 01:08:51.723
If she ain't, then you don't.

01:08:51.756 --> 01:08:52.857
Let's talk
about the money.

01:08:52.890 --> 01:08:54.026
I ain't
giving you nothing now.

01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:55.194
I'll tell
you what I know.

01:08:55.227 --> 01:08:55.926
All right.

01:08:57.029 --> 01:08:58.130
Now if you for sure for
sure, give me the address.

01:08:58.163 --> 01:09:00.198
At the dog park,
I saw this van pulling up

01:09:00.232 --> 01:09:01.200
with these girls getting out.

01:09:01.233 --> 01:09:02.134
Dog?

01:09:02.167 --> 01:09:03.801
No, I wanna
talk about the money.

01:09:03.835 --> 01:09:05.837
You gonna mess around all day?
Like I said.

01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:07.671
If she there, you
gonna get paid.

01:09:07.705 --> 01:09:09.041
I'm not gonna play you, homie.

01:09:09.075 --> 01:09:11.010
All right,
all right, yeah.

01:09:11.042 --> 01:09:12.676
All right, bet it up.

01:09:13.645 --> 01:09:15.081
What you got, big man?

01:09:15.113 --> 01:09:16.680
One of my regular snitches.

01:09:16.714 --> 01:09:19.118
He said he seen the
girl, blonde girl.

01:09:19.151 --> 01:09:21.719
White, suburban, stranger.

01:09:21.752 --> 01:09:23.621
She's been wandering
out the house a lot.

01:09:23.654 --> 01:09:24.788
That's our girl.

01:09:24.823 --> 01:09:26.292
That's our girl.

01:09:26.325 --> 01:09:27.892
We only about a mile away.

01:09:27.926 --> 01:09:28.792
Let's roll.

01:09:45.310 --> 01:09:47.179
Where have you been?

01:09:48.912 --> 01:09:49.781
Shopping.

01:09:50.983 --> 01:09:51.883
Still gotta eat.

01:09:53.419 --> 01:09:54.619
It's been a month.

01:10:02.694 --> 01:10:04.330
I know how long
it's been, Joanna.

01:10:05.965 --> 01:10:07.099
Don't you think I know?

01:10:08.167 --> 01:10:09.767
I can tell you to the day

01:10:11.137 --> 01:10:12.004
and the hour.

01:10:14.974 --> 01:10:18.177
Please, don't
start fighting again.

01:10:19.811 --> 01:10:21.380
Nobody's fighting.

01:10:21.413 --> 01:10:22.982
We're not fighting.

01:10:25.151 --> 01:10:26.018
Good.

01:10:27.153 --> 01:10:30.855
Now, I'd like to
make a suggestion.

01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:35.227
I'd like the two of you
to take the night off

01:10:35.261 --> 01:10:36.996
away from the house.

01:10:37.029 --> 01:10:40.099
Go see a silly comedy movie.

01:10:40.132 --> 01:10:41.333
I'm not seeing a movie.

01:10:42.734 --> 01:10:45.737
Then have a dinner,
go for a walk.

01:10:45.770 --> 01:10:46.905
Joanna, you-

01:10:49.741 --> 01:10:50.808
- What are you wearing?

01:10:52.777 --> 01:10:53.412
Clothes?

01:10:55.014 --> 01:10:56.315
No.

01:10:56.348 --> 01:10:57.316
Go change.

01:10:57.349 --> 01:10:58.450
Why do I have to change?

01:10:59.817 --> 01:11:02.388
Because I said to,
and I'm your father.

01:11:02.421 --> 01:11:03.821
Dad, there's nothing wrong-

01:11:03.855 --> 01:11:05.324
- Go to your room and change!

01:11:16.368 --> 01:11:19.038
It's not her fault, Case.

01:11:19.071 --> 01:11:20.472
Mind your business, Barbara.

01:11:22.374 --> 01:11:23.242
Well.

01:11:24.376 --> 01:11:28.247
With another $20,000
check due tomorrow

01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:30.815
I'd say that everything
that happens around here

01:11:30.848 --> 01:11:32.051
is now my business.

01:11:33.185 --> 01:11:34.386
Don't pay it.

01:11:39.992 --> 01:11:42.094
What?

01:11:44.463 --> 01:11:45.830
She's not coming back.

01:11:48.567 --> 01:11:49.401
Honey.

01:11:54.373 --> 01:11:56.008
Belton is a crook.

01:11:57.409 --> 01:11:59.078
He preys on people like us.

01:12:01.913 --> 01:12:04.116
She's still missing
and he collects

01:12:04.149 --> 01:12:06.018
$20,000 a week.

01:12:10.256 --> 01:12:11.789
She's not coming back.

01:12:19.598 --> 01:12:21.467
It's your friend Captain Belton.

01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:24.169
And I'm sure he gave
Kessler a nice referral fee.

01:12:27.606 --> 01:12:29.141
John?

01:12:29.174 --> 01:12:30.409
Case, hey.

01:12:30.442 --> 01:12:32.877
Look, my man on the street just
got a very, very strong lead.

01:12:32.910 --> 01:12:34.446
Now normally I wouldn't call
you for every little detail

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:36.348
but you told me you
wanted to know everything.

01:12:36.382 --> 01:12:37.983
Wait, wait, are
you gonna check it out?

01:12:38.017 --> 01:12:39.184
Now.

01:12:39.218 --> 01:12:40.552
My guys are strapping
the gear on right now.

01:12:40.586 --> 01:12:41.954
Keep me posted.

01:12:41.987 --> 01:12:44.056
I don't know, Case,
this could be it.

01:12:45.324 --> 01:12:46.191
Let's go!

01:12:56.068 --> 01:12:56.735
I'm good!

01:12:59.638 --> 01:13:03.442
All of a sudden,
I step on there!

01:13:03.475 --> 01:13:04.343
Easy, bros!

01:13:06.545 --> 01:13:08.447
Man, that ain't even funny.

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:10.215
You almost got smoked.

01:13:10.249 --> 01:13:11.183
Oh, man look at y'all.

01:13:11.216 --> 01:13:12.217
All look scared.

01:13:12.251 --> 01:13:14.386
Man, ain't nobody scared.

01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:16.121
You look scared.

01:13:16.155 --> 01:13:17.623
I ain't scared.

01:13:17.656 --> 01:13:19.024
You scared.

01:13:19.058 --> 01:13:20.426
What the hell is
wrong with you, cuz?

01:13:20.459 --> 01:13:22.328
I oughta shoot your
black ass just because.

01:13:22.361 --> 01:13:24.096
Better check
your drawers first.

01:13:25.164 --> 01:13:26.498
But you be happy I come.

01:13:27.633 --> 01:13:30.868
Word on the street, is
y'all got a blonde girl.

01:13:30.902 --> 01:13:32.271
Suburb girl.

01:13:32.304 --> 01:13:34.906
And Biggs be looking
for her everywhere.

01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:38.377
10 large man, 10 large to
the man that bring her in.

01:13:38.410 --> 01:13:40.346
Next man through that door,

01:13:40.379 --> 01:13:43.015
he probably will
shoot your black ass.

01:13:43.048 --> 01:13:43.915
But I know you.

01:13:43.949 --> 01:13:45.117
You the type,

01:13:45.150 --> 01:13:47.119
you the type to take
care of a brother.

01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:49.988
I'm just here to get paid, man.

01:13:52.658 --> 01:13:53.959
Let me check it out.

01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:57.262
What you say is true,
then I straighten you out.

01:14:05.371 --> 01:14:06.238
Yeah.

01:14:07.706 --> 01:14:08.574
Okay.

01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:12.945
Yeah, thanks, John.

01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:21.987
It wasn't her.

01:14:24.056 --> 01:14:25.591
They raided the house,

01:14:25.624 --> 01:14:29.461
there's a blonde
girl there, young.

01:14:31.230 --> 01:14:33.165
Looked out of place for Detroit.

01:14:38.070 --> 01:14:41.106
But she was there of
her own free will, 19.

01:14:44.543 --> 01:14:46.078
Looked like Allison.

01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:49.515
But it wasn't her.

01:14:53.018 --> 01:14:54.019
Fire him.

01:14:55.053 --> 01:14:55.920
God, Joanna.

01:14:57.589 --> 01:14:59.458
I can't handle
it anymore, Case,

01:14:59.491 --> 01:15:00.925
I just can't take it.

01:15:04.396 --> 01:15:05.264
Case.

01:15:09.301 --> 01:15:10.402
Maybe it's time.

01:15:11.637 --> 01:15:12.504
No, it isn't.

01:15:13.472 --> 01:15:14.540
He's getting closer.

01:15:15.707 --> 01:15:17.409
No, he's just
stringing us along.

01:15:17.443 --> 01:15:18.610
I'm telling you, it's...

01:15:20.145 --> 01:15:23.048
Oh my god, I just can't
handle it anymore.

01:15:23.081 --> 01:15:23.949
Jo.

01:15:25.083 --> 01:15:26.452
Now my daughter's alive.

01:15:26.485 --> 01:15:28.454
You know what, she's
alive, she's in Chicago,

01:15:28.487 --> 01:15:32.291
she's with her
boyfriend and

01:15:32.324 --> 01:15:33.192
she's happy.

01:15:36.628 --> 01:15:37.963
It's a lie, Jo.

01:15:39.631 --> 01:15:41.533
It's a lie I'm
willing to live with

01:15:41.567 --> 01:15:44.102
because I can't live
like this anymore.

01:15:47.172 --> 01:15:48.040
Case.

01:15:50.242 --> 01:15:51.376
She may be right.

01:15:54.646 --> 01:15:57.115
I have to save some
money for myself.

01:15:59.351 --> 01:16:00.752
And there's Rachel's college.

01:16:05.123 --> 01:16:05.991

01:16:29.515 --> 01:16:31.383
Man, I ain't even
gonna lie to you.

01:16:31.416 --> 01:16:33.752

01:16:35.554 --> 01:16:37.256

Well, that happens too.

01:18:09.214 --> 01:18:11.917
It's all part of the deal.

01:18:11.951 --> 01:18:13.452

01:19:27.526 --> 01:19:28.393

01:19:29.695 --> 01:19:30.696
Hey, John.

01:19:33.032 --> 01:19:34.633

01:19:35.867 --> 01:19:37.970

01:19:45.877 --> 01:19:47.312
Hmm.

01:19:47.345 --> 01:19:50.282
My $20,000 a week friend, huh?

01:19:51.750 --> 01:19:52.985
It's my job, Case.

01:19:53.019 --> 01:19:54.753
It doesn't mean
I don't like you.

01:19:55.921 --> 01:19:58.223
Yeah, sure.

01:19:59.491 --> 01:20:00.392
You okay?

01:20:01.693 --> 01:20:03.695
Yeah, yeah.

01:20:03.729 --> 01:20:06.898
I'm on top of the
world, old buddy!

01:20:09.001 --> 01:20:10.502
How's the family?

01:20:10.535 --> 01:20:11.403
The family?

01:20:12.671 --> 01:20:13.538
Your wife?

01:20:15.074 --> 01:20:17.375
Your mother-in-law,
Rachel, the family.

01:20:17.409 --> 01:20:18.410
The family.

01:20:19.578 --> 01:20:20.879
I don't know.

01:20:22.314 --> 01:20:24.883
I'm in a hotel, John.

01:20:24.916 --> 01:20:25.851
It's a nice room.

01:20:27.452 --> 01:20:28.920
It has HBO.

01:20:28.955 --> 01:20:30.722
I hear there's a
continental breakfast

01:20:30.756 --> 01:20:32.891
so I'm looking forward to that.

01:20:32.924 --> 01:20:35.794
Hey, come down here and
have a drink with me.

01:20:37.362 --> 01:20:38.430
Can't do that, Case.

01:20:40.499 --> 01:20:41.934
Three time loser, huh?

01:20:43.368 --> 01:20:44.036
That's right.

01:20:50.442 --> 01:20:51.676
You have a family, John?

01:21:00.352 --> 01:21:03.455
Yeah, they're slipping
away from me, Case.

01:21:03.488 --> 01:21:04.356
Mmm.

01:21:05.624 --> 01:21:07.425
Captain John Belton.

01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:11.998
Alcoholic with a dishonorable
discharge from the Marines.

01:21:12.031 --> 01:21:14.833
You know, that wasn't
part of your sales pitch.

01:21:17.702 --> 01:21:20.772
One of my boys was
behind enemy lines.

01:21:21.974 --> 01:21:23.075
I was ordered to stand down

01:21:23.109 --> 01:21:24.843
but I let my team in anyway.

01:21:26.711 --> 01:21:30.549
And when I returned, I
assaulted my superior officer.

01:21:34.153 --> 01:21:36.321
It was a long time ago.

01:21:40.859 --> 01:21:42.794
Can you find her, John?

01:21:46.999 --> 01:21:48.000
Can you find my girl?

01:21:49.868 --> 01:21:51.369
You fired me, Case.

01:21:53.672 --> 01:21:55.074
My mother-in-law fired you.

01:21:55.107 --> 01:21:56.575
I'm hiring you.

01:21:57.742 --> 01:22:00.712
Allison's college fund
is good for a few weeks.

01:22:01.948 --> 01:22:02.814
You're drunk.

01:22:03.815 --> 01:22:07.519
Look, do you want the
job or not, you coward?

01:22:09.088 --> 01:22:10.789
Let me ask you something, John.

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:15.493
Is there any hope left?

01:22:20.933 --> 01:22:24.736
Yeah, there's
definitely hope left.

01:22:24.769 --> 01:22:27.173
And every second counts, Case.

01:22:27.206 --> 01:22:29.008
I'm gonna get back
on it right now.

01:22:35.214 --> 01:22:36.082
Okay.

01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:39.618
Okay.

01:22:49.728 --> 01:22:51.130
I bet you'll come down
for that drink now,

01:22:51.163 --> 01:22:55.134
won't you, my $20,000
a week friend?

01:22:55.167 --> 01:22:56.701
Do you wanna insult me

01:22:56.735 --> 01:22:58.803
or do you wanna help
me find your daughter?

01:23:01.173 --> 01:23:01.840
I'm sorry.

01:23:03.475 --> 01:23:04.944
I mean it, John,
I didn't mean...

01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:09.181
You and me partners?

01:23:10.649 --> 01:23:11.783
Butch and Sundance?

01:23:13.019 --> 01:23:13.885
Yeah.

01:23:15.054 --> 01:23:15.921
You and me.

01:23:17.689 --> 01:23:19.858
Why don't you get some
sleep now, partner

01:23:19.891 --> 01:23:21.459
and I'll call you
in the morning?

01:23:23.662 --> 01:23:24.663
All right.

01:23:25.764 --> 01:23:27.832
All right, I'm gonna
get some sleep.

01:23:53.025 --> 01:23:54.926
I don't want you to
be mad at your mom.

01:23:57.096 --> 01:23:57.964
Okay.

01:24:00.099 --> 01:24:01.000
Life is hard.

01:24:05.037 --> 01:24:06.571
I guess it doesn't
get any easier

01:24:06.604 --> 01:24:07.906
but you're gonna be okay.

01:24:09.674 --> 01:24:10.875
Dad?

01:24:10.909 --> 01:24:12.144
Yeah?

01:24:12.178 --> 01:24:14.246
I don't want you to go.

01:24:18.017 --> 01:24:18.883

01:26:42.394 --> 01:26:44.396

You'll be okay.

01:27:06.452 --> 01:27:07.785

They're backed up.

01:27:35.147 --> 01:27:36.949
Don't have time to
come arrest the pimp.

01:27:36.982 --> 01:27:39.218
He's gonna get
away with it again.

01:27:39.251 --> 01:27:40.752
No he's not.

01:27:40.785 --> 01:27:42.154

Good way to get

I lived a long life, son.

01:27:53.831 --> 01:27:56.101
If the Lord's will

01:27:57.403 --> 01:27:58.803

01:28:00.172 --> 01:28:03.908
If I go down, pick up my phone.

01:28:05.377 --> 01:28:08.247

01:28:09.215 --> 01:28:11.350
Let me get my gun and go
out there with you, sir.

01:28:11.383 --> 01:28:12.218
No, no.

01:28:12.251 --> 01:28:13.851
No violence tonight, son.

01:28:14.886 --> 01:28:16.121
You got this.

01:28:17.855 --> 01:28:18.856
May God bless you, sir.

01:28:22.927 --> 01:28:24.896
- God bless you.
- God bless you.

01:28:35.074 --> 01:28:37.842
What's your name?

01:28:38.910 --> 01:28:40.346
I see your face!

01:28:40.379 --> 01:28:41.779
I see your car!

01:28:42.481 --> 01:28:45.817
You get out of my neighborhood!

01:28:45.850 --> 01:28:48.254
You stay out of my neighborhood!

01:28:48.287 --> 01:28:51.523
If I ever see you in
my neighborhood again,

01:28:51.557 --> 01:28:53.292
I'ma forget I'm a pastor!

01:29:06.272 --> 01:29:07.139
John.

01:29:08.274 --> 01:29:09.541
Just got a call from
one of my contacts

01:29:09.575 --> 01:29:10.509
at the hospital.

01:29:10.542 --> 01:29:12.278
A church group rescued a girl.

01:29:12.311 --> 01:29:13.445
Looks like she's been
through the ringer.

01:29:13.479 --> 01:29:14.413
You know the type?

01:29:15.314 --> 01:29:16.881
Go on.

01:29:16.914 --> 01:29:19.418
The girl says that she's
been imprisoned for a while.

01:29:19.451 --> 01:29:21.487
The nurse said that she
mentioned a blonde girl.

01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:23.821
Description matches Allison's.

01:29:23.855 --> 01:29:25.424
Tex, go with her.

01:29:37.136 --> 01:29:39.471
Hi, we're trying
to find Vanessa Garcia.

01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:43.442
Down the hall to
the right, third bed.

01:29:43.475 --> 01:29:45.110
Wait, wait!

01:29:45.144 --> 01:29:46.345
What do you want with my niece?

01:29:46.378 --> 01:29:47.980
Private investigator, Ma'am.

01:29:48.013 --> 01:29:49.381
We're trying to find
somebody we believe

01:29:49.415 --> 01:29:51.984
may have been kidnapped
alongside your daughter.

01:29:52.017 --> 01:29:53.851
She's been through enough!

01:29:53.885 --> 01:29:55.820
She's answered the
police's questions!

01:29:57.289 --> 01:29:58.923
Tell them, Pastor.

01:29:58.957 --> 01:30:00.326
Tell them to leave
my girl alone!

01:30:00.359 --> 01:30:02.528
Ma'am, we're just trying
to help find somebody.

01:30:05.197 --> 01:30:06.065
Esperanza.

01:30:07.366 --> 01:30:09.968
This man is trying
to save other girls

01:30:10.002 --> 01:30:11.136
just like her.

01:30:12.338 --> 01:30:14.973
The Lord wants us
to help him do that.

01:30:21.046 --> 01:30:22.548
If you think
it's best, Pastor.

01:30:23.549 --> 01:30:24.416
I do.

01:30:26.385 --> 01:30:27.386
Thank you, Pastor.

01:30:35.661 --> 01:30:36.595
Hi.

01:30:36.628 --> 01:30:38.430
You here for Vanessa Garcia?

01:30:38.464 --> 01:30:39.331
One second.

01:30:40.966 --> 01:30:41.600
Thank you.

01:30:43.369 --> 01:30:46.372
Okay, I gave her something
for the withdrawal.

01:30:46.405 --> 01:30:48.340
She's hooked on oxycontin.

01:30:48.374 --> 01:30:50.875
She's gonna crash
hard, real hard.

01:30:52.077 --> 01:30:54.947
As tough as it is,
talking to her now

01:30:54.980 --> 01:30:57.383
is probably the
best thing, okay?

01:30:57.416 --> 01:30:58.283
There she is.

01:30:59.151 --> 01:31:00.052
Thank you.

01:31:08.293 --> 01:31:09.161
It's okay.

01:31:10.362 --> 01:31:12.331
My name is Karen
and I'm a friend.

01:31:15.534 --> 01:31:17.503
Honey, what's your name?

01:31:26.712 --> 01:31:27.579
My name?

01:31:30.115 --> 01:31:31.483
Yeah.

01:31:31.517 --> 01:31:33.118
You remember your name, right?

01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:35.387
Vanessa.

01:31:43.729 --> 01:31:45.531
Vanessa, where
did you come from?

01:31:49.368 --> 01:31:52.337
He used to call me
his little songbird.

01:31:56.575 --> 01:31:57.409
I'm a singer.

01:32:01.613 --> 01:32:03.715
Daddy's house.

01:32:03.749 --> 01:32:06.518
Do you know
where the house is?

01:32:09.588 --> 01:32:11.390
I don't know.

01:32:11.423 --> 01:32:13.125
I don't know.

01:32:13.158 --> 01:32:14.626
What's the house near, honey?

01:32:15.761 --> 01:32:17.196
I don't know.

01:32:18.163 --> 01:32:19.698
I don't know.

01:32:19.731 --> 01:32:22.367
Can you remember anything
that's near the house?

01:32:28.774 --> 01:32:29.641
Dogs.

01:32:32.277 --> 01:32:33.979
There's a park and,

01:32:36.782 --> 01:32:38.650
there was a store in the corner.

01:32:41.487 --> 01:32:42.354
Good.

01:32:47.626 --> 01:32:50.562
Vanessa, have you
seen this girl before?

01:32:53.398 --> 01:32:54.266
Yeah.

01:32:56.502 --> 01:33:00.506
She's my friend.

01:33:00.539 --> 01:33:02.608
Okay, and you're
sure you know her?

01:33:05.377 --> 01:33:06.245
Allison.

01:33:13.385 --> 01:33:14.253
Vanessa?

01:33:15.387 --> 01:33:17.489
Vanessa, I want
you to look at me.

01:33:19.625 --> 01:33:21.627
We will find Allison.

01:33:22.694 --> 01:33:23.562
Do you hear me?

01:33:24.563 --> 01:33:25.564
We will find her.

01:33:27.432 --> 01:33:30.502
And you, you're safe now.

01:33:33.238 --> 01:33:34.106
You're safe.

01:34:11.343 --> 01:34:12.210
Yeah.

01:34:13.145 --> 01:34:13.812
Yeah.

01:34:17.316 --> 01:34:19.251
She gave a positive
ID on your daughter,

01:34:19.284 --> 01:34:20.619
knew her by name.

01:34:23.589 --> 01:34:24.523
She's ali...

01:34:26.491 --> 01:34:28.527
Allison's alive?

01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:29.428
Yes.

01:34:31.163 --> 01:34:32.497
And in Detroit?

01:34:32.531 --> 01:34:34.499
Well we assume so
for the time being.

01:34:37.903 --> 01:34:40.138
What do you mean
for the time being?

01:34:40.172 --> 01:34:41.673
Look, Case, these
people that I deal with,

01:34:41.707 --> 01:34:43.408
they're smart, okay?

01:34:43.442 --> 01:34:44.576
As soon as they feel
the noose tightening

01:34:44.610 --> 01:34:48.480
they get up and they move their
operation to another city.

01:34:48.513 --> 01:34:50.148
Our leads are strong.

01:34:50.182 --> 01:34:52.517
Okay, we got some
really good breaks.

01:34:54.620 --> 01:34:55.554
Thank you, John.

01:34:57.856 --> 01:35:00.125
How are things at home, Case?

01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:03.161
I haven't been home in a week.

01:35:04.396 --> 01:35:06.531
Well you tell Joanna
we're getting close.

01:35:10.636 --> 01:35:12.904
John, be honest with me.

01:35:17.342 --> 01:35:19.277
Are we gonna find my daughter?

01:35:24.549 --> 01:35:29.454
If I tell her and we
don't find Allison,

01:35:31.690 --> 01:35:33.392
Joanna will never forgive me.

01:35:34.926 --> 01:35:36.294
What would you do, John?

01:35:38.330 --> 01:35:39.197
Pray.

01:35:40.365 --> 01:35:45.370
I may
be all prayed out.

01:35:46.438 --> 01:35:47.739
You always have one left.

01:35:51.543 --> 01:35:52.411
Yeah.

01:36:05.992 --> 01:36:09.461
Look man, give me the Caddy
straight up for the Benz.

01:36:09.494 --> 01:36:10.729
Stolen?

01:36:10.762 --> 01:36:12.698
No man, it ain't stolen.

01:36:12.731 --> 01:36:15.734
I got papers for
you and everything.

01:36:15.767 --> 01:36:17.502
Why do
you wanna get rid of it?

01:36:17.536 --> 01:36:18.704
You talk too much.

01:36:18.737 --> 01:36:20.639
We talking business or
we talking personal?

01:36:20.672 --> 01:36:22.274
Hey, you're on my lot.

01:36:22.307 --> 01:36:24.643
And I'm about to
not be on your lot.

01:36:24.676 --> 01:36:26.344
You want my money or don't you?

01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:30.782
Straight up for the Cadillac?

01:36:30.816 --> 01:36:32.018
Straight up, let's go.

01:36:32.051 --> 01:36:32.918
Let's do it.

01:36:45.330 --> 01:36:47.699
36 hours since
Vanessa was rescued.

01:36:47.733 --> 01:36:50.268
The clock is still
ticking, people.

01:36:50.302 --> 01:36:51.236
Biggs?

01:36:51.269 --> 01:36:53.039
Well, I mean there's
a few of those Benzes

01:36:53.072 --> 01:36:53.940
floating around the city.

01:36:53.973 --> 01:36:55.607
Detroit's a big place.

01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:56.742
This might be the right Benz

01:36:56.775 --> 01:36:59.544
or it could be some other
cat's Benz, I don't know.

01:36:59.578 --> 01:37:00.712
All right, but
your contact says

01:37:00.746 --> 01:37:02.314
they are running girls
out of that house.

01:37:02.347 --> 01:37:04.483
That's what the brother
say, but he a crackhead.

01:37:04.516 --> 01:37:05.851
They'll say anything
to get paid.

01:37:05.884 --> 01:37:06.785
The neighborhood?

01:37:06.818 --> 01:37:07.753
Well there's a dog park

01:37:07.786 --> 01:37:09.654
and there's a corner store too.

01:37:09.688 --> 01:37:11.490
Huh, but they call it
that because there's one

01:37:11.523 --> 01:37:12.390
on every corner.

01:37:12.424 --> 01:37:13.792
Aaron.

01:37:13.825 --> 01:37:15.327
Park me up front of the house,

01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:17.362
I'll pick up the
wifi if they have it.

01:37:17.395 --> 01:37:19.664
Probably pick up a
few other houses too.

01:37:19.698 --> 01:37:21.500
I won't know which signal
is coming from our house

01:37:21.533 --> 01:37:22.901
so I'll have to
break the passcodes

01:37:22.935 --> 01:37:24.302
and that can take time.

01:37:24.336 --> 01:37:25.303
How much time?

01:37:25.337 --> 01:37:27.405
I don't know, time.

01:37:27.439 --> 01:37:28.640
Then it's gonna
take me even longer

01:37:28.673 --> 01:37:29.841
to go through everything.

01:37:29.875 --> 01:37:31.810
I may have to break
emails, social media,

01:37:31.843 --> 01:37:33.411
if they've recently
cleared their history.

01:37:33.445 --> 01:37:35.781
All right, all right, all
right, I got it, I got it.

01:37:35.814 --> 01:37:37.582
Tex, take the van, park
it out there tonight.

01:37:37.616 --> 01:37:39.417
See what computer boy can get.

01:38:00.472 --> 01:38:02.340
I'm in their system, John.

01:38:02.374 --> 01:38:03.542
There's definitely some girls.

01:38:03.575 --> 01:38:05.410
There's just no
pictures of Allison.

01:38:05.443 --> 01:38:07.612
You tell me that there's
a tan Benz in that driveway,

01:38:07.646 --> 01:38:09.414
it's time to kick
down some doors.

01:38:16.822 --> 01:38:18.057
No, sir.

01:38:18.090 --> 01:38:19.258
Cadillac, red.

01:38:27.934 --> 01:38:28.968
What do you wanna do, Captain?

01:38:31.803 --> 01:38:32.671
Stand down.

01:38:38.510 --> 01:38:40.112
What did he say,
are we going in?

01:38:41.479 --> 01:38:42.781
We've been
ordered to stand down.

01:38:42.814 --> 01:38:43.682
Dammit!

01:38:46.685 --> 01:38:48.120
I got it.

01:38:48.154 --> 01:38:50.522
Call everybody, get
them in the office, now!

01:38:52.557 --> 01:38:53.525
Hoo rah, son.

01:38:55.527 --> 01:38:56.728
How sure are you?

01:38:56.761 --> 01:38:57.997
100 percent.

01:38:58.030 --> 01:38:59.999
Ain't nothing a
hundred percent.

01:39:00.032 --> 01:39:02.367
Find, then I'm 99.

01:39:03.702 --> 01:39:06.038
Somebody in that neighborhood
is pimping out girls.

01:39:06.072 --> 01:39:08.140
I see them posting
ads for it constantly.

01:39:09.474 --> 01:39:10.109
Biggs.

01:39:10.142 --> 01:39:11.143
I got one more guy.

01:39:11.177 --> 01:39:12.744
Said the house with the Caddy

01:39:12.777 --> 01:39:15.547
used to have a Benz over there.

01:39:15.580 --> 01:39:16.915
So now along with the crackhead,

01:39:16.949 --> 01:39:18.150
that now makes two.

01:39:19.185 --> 01:39:21.087
But my one new guy,

01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:23.990
he said he believes
that the Benz was white.

01:39:24.023 --> 01:39:25.490
How do you feel about it?

01:39:27.126 --> 01:39:28.027
I'm not sure, boss.

01:39:28.060 --> 01:39:29.028
Maybe 50 percent.

01:39:32.797 --> 01:39:35.600
Case, it's your daughter.

01:39:35.634 --> 01:39:37.502
You gotta make the call.

01:39:37.535 --> 01:39:39.671
If we go into the wrong house,

01:39:39.704 --> 01:39:41.173
they are gonna move her.

01:39:41.207 --> 01:39:44.110
To some other city,
Chicago, New York, Atlanta.

01:39:45.543 --> 01:39:47.579
I have no idea, we may
never find her again.

01:39:47.612 --> 01:39:51.650
If we wait, we may
get a stronger lead.

01:39:51.816 --> 01:39:53.718
The truth is, they know
the noose is tightening.

01:39:53.752 --> 01:39:54.819
They know we're looking for her.

01:39:54.853 --> 01:39:57.522
They may move her in the
next couple of days anyway.

01:40:00.026 --> 01:40:00.892
It's your call.

01:40:10.735 --> 01:40:11.603
Kick it down.

01:40:14.941 --> 01:40:16.875
All right, you heard
the man, let's go.

01:40:16.908 --> 01:40:18.010
I'm going with you.

01:40:18.044 --> 01:40:19.778
No, you're staying here
and letting us do our job.

01:40:19.811 --> 01:40:20.712
I'm getting in that car.

01:40:20.745 --> 01:40:22.580
You wanna stop me, shoot me.

01:41:24.176 --> 01:41:25.677
Got one coming to you, Tex!

01:41:25.710 --> 01:41:28.147
Get his ass out of here!

01:41:46.032 --> 01:41:47.699
Good work, son.

01:41:47.732 --> 01:41:48.566
Hoo rah.

01:42:46.891 --> 01:42:47.759
Allison.

01:42:52.797 --> 01:42:53.631
Excuse me.

01:44:18.217 --> 01:44:19.051
Alex?

01:44:19.084 --> 01:44:20.319
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:44:20.352 --> 01:44:22.488
Where are we going?

01:44:22.521 --> 01:44:23.821
You'll see.
