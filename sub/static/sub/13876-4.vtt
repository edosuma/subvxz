00:51.524 --> 00:53.155
Little bit left. Little bit left.

00:53.225 --> 00:55.555
Higher, higher.

00:55.635 --> 00:58.226
And...
Drop it!

00:59.266 --> 01:01.537
What in tarnation is --

01:01.607 --> 01:03.168
- Mine is what it is!

01:03.238 --> 01:04.798
You don't touch it
or look at it.

01:04.878 --> 01:06.639
But if you would be
so kind

01:06.709 --> 01:08.479
as to plug it in,
please?

01:08.549 --> 01:10.020
- Okey dokey, smokey.

01:10.080 --> 01:11.710
Are you getting smart with me?
- No.

01:11.780 --> 01:14.051
- You better watch your mouth
or that mouth will come off.

01:14.121 --> 01:15.711
Okey, dokey, smoke--

01:15.791 --> 01:17.482
um, artichokey.

01:17.562 --> 01:18.852
Now, that's better.

01:18.932 --> 01:20.693
'cause vegetables are
the core of the universe.

01:20.763 --> 01:22.253
What the hell happened
to the roof?

01:22.333 --> 01:23.804
What do l look like,
a carpenter?

01:23.864 --> 01:25.804
All l do know is she better
fix it when she arrives.

01:25.874 --> 01:27.805
She?
She who?

01:27.875 --> 01:29.435
- You know,
the collective ''she.''

01:29.505 --> 01:31.096
All women of the world!

01:31.176 --> 01:32.476
For behold,

01:32.546 --> 01:36.137
the ultimate
chick magnet!

01:38.588 --> 01:41.019
''Plug it in and let the fun begin.''
- MEATWAD: Mm-hmm.

01:41.089 --> 01:42.579
- ''Big booty time tonight.''
- Yeah.

01:42.659 --> 01:45.530
- ''Penis will touch vagina
in a big and exciting way.''

01:45.600 --> 01:47.031
Alright, yo!

01:47.101 --> 01:48.591
''All purchases are final.''
Hmph.

01:48.661 --> 01:50.462
Meatwad, open all
the windows and doors.

01:50.532 --> 01:52.472
l don't want anything
slowing down

01:52.542 --> 01:56.033
the river of coos that's
gonna be flowing in here.

01:56.113 --> 01:57.664
- And, what's this?
- Sex lube.

01:57.744 --> 01:59.334
Hey, baby.
Where you from, baby?

01:59.414 --> 02:01.005
lt comes with the stud package.

02:01.085 --> 02:02.985
- lt says, ''sex lube not included
in sex lube bottle.''

02:03.055 --> 02:04.246
- Hey, baby.
Touch them for me, baby.

02:04.316 --> 02:05.416
l'm so into you,
baby.

02:05.486 --> 02:07.477
l love you, baby.
Rub my butt, baby.

02:07.557 --> 02:09.646
Those are patented pick-up lines
crafted for me

02:09.727 --> 02:11.488
and my specific situation.

02:11.558 --> 02:13.529
- Where you going, baby?
Don't run out on me, baby.

02:13.599 --> 02:15.569
l'll stalk you,
baby.

02:15.639 --> 02:17.070
- lt doesn't make sense,
what you're doing.

02:17.140 --> 02:18.870
l still don't see
no women,

02:18.940 --> 02:20.531
baby.

02:20.611 --> 02:21.901
- What's up?

02:21.971 --> 02:23.502
ls it plugged in
yet?

02:23.582 --> 02:24.542
lt's been plugged in.

02:24.612 --> 02:26.102
Well, plug in it
harder!

02:26.182 --> 02:28.443
See, it sends out waves
of vibrating joy --

02:28.513 --> 02:30.454
Yeah, yeah, l've seen
the commercial.

02:30.524 --> 02:32.314
Yeah, well, it works
on the commercial.

02:32.394 --> 02:33.785
l know. lt does.

02:33.855 --> 02:35.125
- So you know
how it works, then.

02:35.195 --> 02:36.525
- lt's a commercial.

02:36.595 --> 02:38.356
- Yeah, and that's just
a demonstration.

02:38.426 --> 02:40.126
Turn it up
to ''Caligula.''

02:40.196 --> 02:41.967
- Uh, there's no settings.

02:42.037 --> 02:44.028
- Obviously, a part
is missing,

02:44.108 --> 02:46.098
the part that pulls in
the coos.

02:46.178 --> 02:48.039
Ain't nothing
in here.

02:48.109 --> 02:49.409
But this screw.

02:49.479 --> 02:50.950
- Throw it away!
lt's extra!

02:51.010 --> 02:52.950
- No, l'm sure the screw
goes in here somewhere.

02:53.020 --> 02:55.071
- No! No!
lt's a double entendre.

02:55.151 --> 02:57.382
For the screwing
that's gonna happen.

02:57.452 --> 02:59.482
- Yeah.
You gettin' screwed.

02:59.562 --> 03:01.323
Oh, is that right?

03:01.393 --> 03:03.053
l will take this
to the nightclub,

03:03.133 --> 03:05.964
and we shall see
who is getting screwed.

03:06.034 --> 03:07.725
Hardest!

03:12.946 --> 03:15.737
How's it going?

03:15.817 --> 03:17.678
Anybody see an outlet?

03:17.748 --> 03:19.648
l know they're
getting electricity

03:19.718 --> 03:21.379
'cause, uh, frequently
these lights,

03:21.449 --> 03:23.049
they run on it.

03:23.119 --> 03:25.090
Yeah, l'm an engineer.

03:25.160 --> 03:27.991
You know, l have electricity
back at my pad.

03:28.061 --> 03:30.361
And l got the mad cash

03:30.431 --> 03:32.732
to pay for it, too.

03:34.673 --> 03:37.143
l'm into sex.

03:39.114 --> 03:41.545
This is a sausage factory!

03:44.916 --> 03:45.846
Well, how did it work?

03:47.687 --> 03:49.207
lt was...

03:49.287 --> 03:50.377
awesome!

03:50.457 --> 03:52.118
l mean,
l got so laid

03:52.188 --> 03:55.429
it's dangerous
for my life.

03:55.499 --> 03:57.089
l think l may need
to return this.

03:57.169 --> 03:58.600
Oh, no, you can't
do that.

03:58.670 --> 04:00.100
See, Meatwad
ate the box,

04:00.170 --> 04:01.761
the receipt,
and the proof of purchase.

04:01.841 --> 04:03.271
Done pooped it out.

04:03.341 --> 04:04.932
l got hyper bowels.

04:05.012 --> 04:06.072
Well, that's just great!

04:06.142 --> 04:07.582
l kept your screw.
You want the screw?

04:07.643 --> 04:09.583
Throw it away!
lt's worthless!

04:09.653 --> 04:11.844
No, no.
l didn't --

04:11.914 --> 04:13.944
No, l did not order it.

04:14.024 --> 04:15.045
Yes.

04:15.125 --> 04:16.644
Yes, l am Studhouser,

04:16.725 --> 04:19.526
and yes,
my pin is 6969.

04:19.596 --> 04:21.857
But l did not order this, sir.

04:21.927 --> 04:23.557
And l'll have you know

04:23.637 --> 04:26.258
l am no stranger
to litigation.

04:26.338 --> 04:29.329
Been sued many times,
enjoy every second of it.

04:29.409 --> 04:32.340
Oh? Oh, is that right?

04:32.410 --> 04:35.111
That's the sound
of my precious chick magnet

04:35.181 --> 04:37.121
being demolished

04:37.181 --> 04:39.622
because you could not
give me a straight answer.

04:39.692 --> 04:42.423
Let me speak
to your supervisor.

04:42.493 --> 04:44.353
Oh, he's on the moon, is he?

04:44.423 --> 04:48.155
All right, fine.
When do you expect him back?

04:48.235 --> 04:49.895
Two thou--

04:49.965 --> 04:52.096
<i>2032.</i>

04:52.166 --> 04:55.467
Okay, but you
radio him this --

04:55.537 --> 04:57.207
l am angry,

04:57.277 --> 05:00.008
and l want
my money back.

05:00.078 --> 05:01.709
Yes.

05:01.779 --> 05:04.219
l will take a free bottle
of sex lube.

05:04.289 --> 05:06.780
This is not
a trade-off, though.

05:06.860 --> 05:09.951
Okay, goodbye.
Thank you, Charles.

05:10.031 --> 05:11.361
Well, what did they say?

05:11.431 --> 05:12.952
They are...

05:13.032 --> 05:14.622
paying me...

05:14.702 --> 05:16.793
to advertise
the product.

05:16.873 --> 05:18.364
Can you believe it?

05:18.434 --> 05:19.374
No.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.905
Well, l do.

05:21.975 --> 05:26.536
l really wish he'd just
get rid of that magnet.

05:26.616 --> 05:27.946
lt looks so awful
in the living room

05:28.016 --> 05:29.507
next to that chair,
don't you think, Meatwad?

05:29.587 --> 05:31.217
l mean, l wish they could
just redo the whole room.

05:31.287 --> 05:33.218
Maybe you could
drop a hint to him, like,

05:33.288 --> 05:35.559
''This magnet will look
better out on the street''

05:35.629 --> 05:37.429
and ''l hate this magnet''

05:37.499 --> 05:38.960
and ''This magnet sucks.''

05:39.030 --> 05:40.790
You know, you're right.

05:40.870 --> 05:43.131
Put on some tea and heat up
those little cakes he likes,

05:43.201 --> 05:45.102
and l'll go talk to him.

05:47.172 --> 05:49.503
Shake, we need to talk.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.483
Yes, we do.

05:51.543 --> 05:53.244
'cause Oprah is
about to give

05:53.314 --> 05:56.255
everyone in the audience
a Ford Taurus!

05:56.325 --> 05:58.786
Ooh! What book is she
reading this week?

05:58.856 --> 06:00.226
<i>The Pregnant Mind.</i>

06:00.296 --> 06:02.227
And seriously, has
she ever looked better?

06:02.297 --> 06:03.857
l don't think so.

06:03.927 --> 06:05.728
Commercial!
What's up?

06:05.798 --> 06:07.458
- Umm.

06:07.538 --> 06:09.229
Oh, nothing.

06:09.309 --> 06:11.799
Here's some tea.
And those cakes that you like.

06:11.869 --> 06:13.600
- That is so sweet.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.611
lt's a sweet treat from
the sweetest person l know.

06:15.681 --> 06:17.271
You're welcome.

06:17.351 --> 06:18.752
Are you okay?

06:18.812 --> 06:20.752
Just allergies.

06:20.822 --> 06:22.443
Frylock.

06:22.523 --> 06:24.583
l couldn't.
l just couldn't tell him.

06:24.653 --> 06:26.454
He never thinks
about my feelings.

06:26.524 --> 06:27.684
Oh, come on, now.

06:27.764 --> 06:29.525
He just doesn't
communicate it properly.

06:29.595 --> 06:31.425
He's so ashamed
of that purchase.

06:31.495 --> 06:33.486
You're helping him turn the page
on a difficult chapter.

06:33.566 --> 06:35.096
That's what Oprah
would say.

06:35.166 --> 06:37.467
Wait a minute, why am l
on this Stairmaster?

06:37.537 --> 06:39.138
What the hell
is wrong with me?

06:39.208 --> 06:40.908
That magnet is
a eyesore,

06:40.978 --> 06:42.739
and it's gone today.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.439
Ooh!

06:44.519 --> 06:47.210
Stationery!
l love it.

06:47.290 --> 06:48.650
l know.
l saw it, and l said,

06:48.720 --> 06:50.311
''That is so Shake.''

06:50.391 --> 06:52.292
First off,
l love this paper.

06:52.362 --> 06:53.692
l'm keeping it.

06:53.762 --> 06:55.352
You're gonna get this back
wrapped around something else.

06:55.432 --> 06:57.733
- l know how much you love to write
little notes of encouragement.

06:57.803 --> 07:00.564
- Well, l can tell who's gonna
get a little thank you note.

07:00.634 --> 07:02.625
l think l'm gonna craft it
right now.

07:02.705 --> 07:04.405
Oh, by the way,
l was wondering...

07:04.475 --> 07:06.236
Yeah, what's up?

07:06.316 --> 07:07.836
Um what do you think
about this?

07:07.916 --> 07:09.847
l'm thinking about,
you know,

07:09.917 --> 07:11.847
putting a designer
pastel over...

07:11.917 --> 07:13.848
everything in the room,
but mostly the magnet.

07:13.918 --> 07:16.079
l --
Do you --

07:16.159 --> 07:17.389
Do you not like it?

07:17.459 --> 07:19.950
Oh, no, no, no!
l love it! l love it.

07:20.030 --> 07:21.660
l just thought
a little pastel,

07:21.730 --> 07:25.171
you know, would dress
the place up a little.

07:25.231 --> 07:28.232
You know,
that is so thoughtful.

07:28.302 --> 07:29.673
l'm picturing it now,

07:29.743 --> 07:31.673
and l think it would
look amazing.

07:31.743 --> 07:33.234
Why couldn't l just say

07:33.314 --> 07:34.904
that, ''l don't like
your stupid magnet!

07:34.984 --> 07:36.575
And it's my house, too!''
Why couldn't l say that?

07:36.655 --> 07:38.645
- Well, you need to look
in the mirror.

07:38.715 --> 07:40.386
'cause they show
reflections.

07:40.456 --> 07:42.386
- You know, you're right.
You're absolutely right.

07:42.456 --> 07:44.397
l have no one to blame
but myself.

07:44.457 --> 07:46.518
Have some self-respect, Frylock.
Stand up to him.

07:46.598 --> 07:48.588
What did you have
in mind here?

07:48.668 --> 07:50.499
l think a cherry
would be wonderful.

07:50.569 --> 07:51.899
Something that really,
sorta accents

07:51.969 --> 07:53.340
the green
in the Astroturf.

07:53.410 --> 07:55.070
Gives it a whole sort
of garden motif.

07:55.140 --> 07:57.511
- Meatwad! Why the
are we in a fabric store?

07:57.581 --> 07:59.912
- 'Cause you said
we gonn' get a --

07:59.982 --> 08:01.912
l hate
the fabric store.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.683
What's going on here?

08:03.753 --> 08:05.613
Tea and cakes?
Stationery gifts?

08:05.683 --> 08:06.844
lt's that magnet.

08:06.924 --> 08:08.784
lt's pulling our feminine side
up to the surface.

08:08.854 --> 08:10.125
And it's gone today, man!

08:10.195 --> 08:11.125
lt's gone.

08:17.437 --> 08:19.237
Wait a minute.

08:19.307 --> 08:21.238
Did you get new shoes?

08:21.308 --> 08:22.798
- No, but l sure need some.

08:22.878 --> 08:24.279
l mean, look at these.

08:24.349 --> 08:25.899
They're so last year.

08:25.979 --> 08:28.350
Let's go shopping.
We'll make a day of it.

08:28.420 --> 08:30.351
Pedicure, brunch?

08:30.421 --> 08:32.081
- No brunch for me.
l feel bloated.

08:32.150 --> 08:33.822
- Aw, listen to him.

08:33.892 --> 08:36.261
Skinny as a rail,
he'll never stop.

08:36.332 --> 08:37.453
Yeah, you know me, l just
get a little crazy

08:37.533 --> 08:39.153
during my --
my period?!

08:39.232 --> 08:40.494
My period?!

08:40.563 --> 08:43.365
- Frylock,
over here.

08:43.434 --> 08:44.805
''Dear Frylock,

08:44.875 --> 08:46.736
your smile lights up my day.

08:46.806 --> 08:48.746
You are smart, funny, caring,

08:48.806 --> 08:50.477
and such a true friend to me.

08:50.547 --> 08:52.707
So would you please
get rid of that magnet

08:52.777 --> 08:55.178
that's causing us
to act like women

08:55.248 --> 08:57.119
and write little notes
to each other

08:57.189 --> 08:58.619
and give out gifts
all the time

08:58.689 --> 08:59.819
whenever we get near it.

08:59.889 --> 09:02.660
'cause l like
when we were men

09:02.730 --> 09:05.701
and we froze a squirrel
and sawed it in half.

09:05.761 --> 09:09.032
Smiley face,
Meatwad.

09:09.102 --> 09:11.503
Get rid of the magnet.

09:11.573 --> 09:12.873
l thought you liked it.

09:12.943 --> 09:14.374
- l kinda don't.

09:14.444 --> 09:15.434
But you like it,
and that's what matters.

09:15.514 --> 09:17.175
- No, then get rid of it.

09:17.245 --> 09:20.236
l'm not sure where
the remote will sit.

09:20.316 --> 09:23.717
l guess l can hold it
in my hand.

09:23.787 --> 09:25.817
Just because you don't
like what l like

09:25.887 --> 09:27.858
does not mean we can't
still be friends.

09:27.928 --> 09:30.489
- l know, l'm so sorry.

09:30.569 --> 09:32.189
- No, because l am sorry.

09:32.269 --> 09:35.290
- No, Shake, l'm sorry.
- No, no, l'm sorry.

09:35.370 --> 09:36.891
Well, you, too!

09:36.971 --> 09:38.461
- No, you,!

09:38.541 --> 09:39.731
- No, 'cause
it's you, time!

09:42.012 --> 09:44.043
Oh, l said it to your face
a number of times.

09:44.113 --> 09:45.583
Well, my face
wasn't looking,

09:45.653 --> 09:47.584
and my ears weren't
listening.

09:47.654 --> 09:49.514
And your teeth are about
to stop chewing, too!

09:50.955 --> 09:53.425
And what's that mean,
Big Man!?

09:53.495 --> 09:55.396
- lt was an awkward attempt
at telling you

09:55.466 --> 09:57.397
that l'm about to kick
the teeth out your head!

09:57.467 --> 09:59.027
Well, l did not...

09:59.097 --> 10:00.898
l did not get that
initially.

10:02.138 --> 10:03.568
Carl, can you help me
with this?

10:03.638 --> 10:05.109
l'm just butterfingers
with tools,

10:05.179 --> 10:07.109
and l just don't want to get
any sweat on my bonnet.

10:07.180 --> 10:08.840
What's in it for me?

10:08.910 --> 10:10.511
- A friendship hug
to warm your soul.

10:10.581 --> 10:12.241
l'll do it.
You just stay back.

10:12.321 --> 10:15.382
Don't want any of your ooze
or juices around me.

10:17.493 --> 10:19.963
All of a sudden,
for no reason at all,

10:20.033 --> 10:21.964
l feel very fat.

10:22.034 --> 10:23.694
Oh, my goodness,
look at my ass.

10:23.764 --> 10:25.705
lt's hideous.
- lt's not bad.

10:25.765 --> 10:27.706
Sure, your ass is big,
but it's not bad.

10:27.776 --> 10:29.036
- Oh, it's awful.

10:29.106 --> 10:30.807
l'm starting the diet
today.

10:30.877 --> 10:32.537
- Well, maybe you should
change your sweat pants.

10:32.607 --> 10:34.308
Black is
the slimming shade.

10:34.378 --> 10:35.908
But that's just
masking the problem,

10:35.978 --> 10:37.509
and l'm not looking
inside,

10:37.589 --> 10:39.519
where the real problem is.

10:39.589 --> 10:41.520
My self-esteem!

10:41.590 --> 10:43.080
- Carl, don't!

10:43.160 --> 10:44.681
That's not what
l meant.

10:48.032 --> 10:50.092
Hey, y'all.
l'm Meatwad.

10:50.172 --> 10:52.433
Wait, wait. Shut up.
Shut up, shake!

10:52.503 --> 10:53.663
You hear that?

10:53.743 --> 10:55.334
Look over there!

10:55.404 --> 10:58.315
- What? Ow!
- You got schooled, son!

10:58.375 --> 10:59.845
Oh, no, no!

10:59.915 --> 11:01.216
Don't you walk away from me!
Where you going?

11:01.286 --> 11:03.186
Well, obviously,
l'm gonna tape up my hands!

11:03.256 --> 11:05.277
l cannot ruin my meal ticket

11:05.357 --> 11:07.287
when l'm beating
your face so hard!

11:07.357 --> 11:09.288
- Well, l used all the tape
taping up a present for ya.

11:09.358 --> 11:10.828
lt's a knuckle sandwich.

11:10.898 --> 11:12.659
- Well, l'm not hungry!

11:12.729 --> 11:14.199
- Well, you wrap it up
and eat it later, then.

11:14.269 --> 11:15.930
- You gonna step to me?
What are you, a wizard?

11:16.000 --> 11:16.990
Let's go!
