WEBVTT

00:18.583 --> 00:19.750
(Diane)
Oh, come on, Barry.

00:19.834 --> 00:20.875
I want to hear the movie.

00:20.959 --> 00:22.583
I don't see
anybody else watching.

00:22.667 --> 00:24.417
It's James Dean.

00:32.333 --> 00:33.625
Peach schnapps?

00:33.709 --> 00:35.000
That's your big move, Barry?

00:35.083 --> 00:36.333
I thought you liked
peach schnapps.

00:36.417 --> 00:37.375
Oh, who told you that?

00:37.458 --> 00:39.375
- Shane Bannif?
- No.

00:39.458 --> 00:41.917
Next time you see
Shane,
ask him what happened

00:42.041 --> 00:42.959
at Devil's Pool.

00:43.041 --> 00:44.125
He took you there?

00:44.208 --> 00:46.000
Pumped me full
of peach schnapps

00:46.083 --> 00:47.667
said he wanted
to jump the
ledge.

00:47.750 --> 00:49.166
- No way.
- Way.

00:49.250 --> 00:53.417
I'd jump, but Shane has
some
last-minute shrinkage.

00:53.500 --> 00:55.041
End of our big date.

00:57.208 --> 00:58.667
I'll take
one of
these.

01:01.625 --> 01:02.834
Bottoms up.

01:17.041 --> 01:19.208
Mmm.

01:19.291 --> 01:21.542
Feels like
we're
being watched.

01:21.625 --> 01:22.709
You wanna go
in the back?

01:28.000 --> 01:29.834
Can you put the top up?

01:29.917 --> 01:32.834
[sighs]
Yeah. Just don't move.

01:39.583 --> 01:41.667
Damn it. It's stuck.

01:41.750 --> 01:44.000
Well, unstick it.

01:49.792 --> 01:51.500
You look...beautiful..

01:57.166 --> 01:58.375
(Diane)
'Help!'

01:58.458 --> 02:00.709
'Somebody help him!'

02:00.792 --> 02:02.500
<i>'Help!'</i>

02:12.750 --> 02:13.792
Well, you look great, Diane.

02:13.875 --> 02:16.166
Ah, capoeira, crunches

02:16.250 --> 02:17.250
six rounds
at the heavy
bag.

02:17.333 --> 02:19.208
I never give an inch.

02:20.375 --> 02:21.792
Boss.

02:21.875 --> 02:23.375
Lill, I'd like you to meet
a friend of mine, Diane
Yates.

02:23.458 --> 02:25.041
Agent Yates, FBI.

02:25.125 --> 02:28.291
This the one
you told me about,
John?

02:28.375 --> 02:30.542
Uh, something I can
help you with?

02:30.625 --> 02:31.625
Maybe.

02:31.709 --> 02:34.041
Diane got her start
in the PPD.

02:34.125 --> 02:35.458
18th District.

02:35.542 --> 02:36.458
Wild west back then.

02:36.542 --> 02:37.917
She blazed a trail for women.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.500
Oh, that's a
bunch
of bull, Johnny.

02:39.583 --> 02:41.333
I got tired of being
groped by the boys'
club

02:41.417 --> 02:42.917
and then being passed
up
for promotion.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.709
Ah, it's more complicated
than that.

02:44.792 --> 02:46.917
What, you want to compare
detective test scores?

02:47.041 --> 02:50.125
The spot you ten points
for having a Y
chromosome.

02:50.208 --> 02:51.792
Well, it's not too long ago.

02:51.875 --> 02:54.041
At least the bureau was
a little bit more
enlightened.

02:54.125 --> 02:57.250
You back for
memories or...coffee?

02:58.458 --> 03:00.125
A case you worked
on a while ago.

03:00.208 --> 03:01.250
(John)
'The fresh job.'

03:01.333 --> 03:02.583
Mel Shaver.

03:02.667 --> 03:04.250
Shot dead walking his dog.

03:04.333 --> 03:06.917
Elmwood Park.
Uh, suspected robbery

03:07.000 --> 03:08.291
went cold
with no witnesses.

03:08.375 --> 03:09.667
Yeah, well,
we'll see about
that.

03:09.750 --> 03:11.208
What's the FBI's
interest in the job?

03:11.291 --> 03:14.083
Classified, listen,
I had a rough one last night

03:14.166 --> 03:17.834
I need a fistful of
Ibuprofen
or something stronger.

03:21.166 --> 03:22.750
Classified.
Give me a break.

03:22.834 --> 03:24.834
Well, just download
her on the case,
Lill.

03:24.917 --> 03:26.417
Maybe she can
help us solve it.

03:28.542 --> 03:31.041
Got some Ibuprofen
in my desk.

03:32.542 --> 03:33.959
Anything stronger?

03:34.041 --> 03:37.959
Mel Shaver, 43-year-old
tax lawyer, shot on November 6

03:38.041 --> 03:39.333
in Elmwood Park.

03:39.417 --> 03:41.333
Recover any ballistics evidence?

03:41.417 --> 03:42.417
Went through and through.

03:42.500 --> 03:45.333
Gold Rolex, a wallet missing.

03:45.417 --> 03:46.875
Got a string of holdups
in the area.

03:46.959 --> 03:48.125
What else?

03:48.208 --> 03:49.709
'Wife says he didn't
have any enemies.'

03:49.792 --> 03:51.625
- Solid citizen.
- What about habits?

03:51.709 --> 03:53.625
Crack or stripping
his bark in the
woods?

03:53.709 --> 03:54.834
Nothing turned up.

03:54.917 --> 03:57.500
Nothing turned up,
or you didn't ask?

03:57.583 --> 04:01.125
I worked the case
and there was nothing to go
on.

04:01.208 --> 04:04.166
It's a Percocet,
left over from an accident.

04:04.250 --> 04:06.792
Shame not to
finish
a prescription.

04:06.875 --> 04:09.125
I didn't need them.

04:09.208 --> 04:13.834
Major Maurice Kitchener
got the end he deserved.

04:15.458 --> 04:17.458
Run my name through
the fed database?

04:17.542 --> 04:19.250
Wouldn't
exactly
describe you

04:19.333 --> 04:21.000
as a solid
citizen,
detective.

04:21.083 --> 04:22.417
Though you
lean that
way.

04:22.500 --> 04:23.500
I do my best.

04:23.583 --> 04:26.417
Of course you
do.
What's this?

04:26.500 --> 04:29.166
It's a wooded area,
adjacent to the kill spot.

04:29.250 --> 04:31.667
No, no, no. Here.

04:33.125 --> 04:34.500
'I need these blown up.'

04:34.583 --> 04:36.834
- Get a high-res scan.
- This is Philadelphia.

04:36.917 --> 04:40.417
We got one lab tech, one copy
machine and a two-week wait.

04:40.500 --> 04:42.166
That's for a hot case.

04:42.250 --> 04:43.625
I'll do it, then.

04:43.709 --> 04:45.667
So is this the extent
of your investigation?

04:45.750 --> 04:47.917
Unless the FBI has
some new information.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.125
No.

04:49.208 --> 04:51.375
We're counting on you
having missed
something.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.667
Hmm. Doubt it.
Case is cold.

04:53.750 --> 04:56.041
Start by
re-interviewing
the wife.

04:56.125 --> 04:57.709
And do you need
approval from Daddy

04:57.792 --> 05:00.375
or can we just
work this case?

05:00.458 --> 05:03.000
How exactly do
you know Stillman?

05:03.083 --> 05:06.750
Johnny always gave me
a fair shake coming
up.

05:06.834 --> 05:08.250
All things considered.

05:08.333 --> 05:09.709
Considering what?

05:09.792 --> 05:11.417
I broke up his marriage.

05:55.041 --> 05:57.709
Hey.

05:57.792 --> 06:00.083
Hey.

06:00.166 --> 06:01.291
You want
a piece of
me?

06:01.375 --> 06:04.417
Nah. Just came to see
how you were doing.

06:04.500 --> 06:07.417
Well, five
hours
a day I get to

06:07.500 --> 06:09.125
talk about my feelings.

06:10.458 --> 06:13.041
Can't sleep 'cause my
roommate's
up every five minutes

06:13.125 --> 06:14.458
washing the germs
off his hands

06:14.542 --> 06:17.959
and lecturing me
about palm oils in my
diet.

06:18.041 --> 06:20.375
Highlight of the
day
is, uh, taking on

06:20.458 --> 06:21.959
my fellow
detectives
in ping-pong

06:22.041 --> 06:24.417
but other than that
things are looking
up.

06:24.500 --> 06:25.500
How's the Jell-O?

06:25.583 --> 06:26.917
Not bad.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.125
Mac and cheese sucks.

06:32.208 --> 06:34.041
Portable DVD player.

06:34.125 --> 06:35.166
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

06:35.250 --> 06:37.125
Thank you.

06:37.208 --> 06:38.792
"The Honeymooners." Ha ha.

06:38.875 --> 06:41.458
"The Godfather One, Two."

06:41.542 --> 06:43.875
[chuckles]
"Midnight
Run."

06:44.917 --> 06:47.125
"The Cutting Edge?"

06:47.208 --> 06:49.125
It's a guilty pleasure.

06:49.208 --> 06:51.542
Mine too. Between us.

06:54.625 --> 06:58.542
DA, uh, reopened
the Billingsley case.

07:00.500 --> 07:03.417
Fat lot of good
that does Joe
Don.

07:05.041 --> 07:06.583
Come on.

07:07.917 --> 07:09.333
Alright.

07:09.417 --> 07:11.166
(female #1)
'Has there been
a break in the case?'

07:11.250 --> 07:13.083
(Lilly)
'It's a routine
reinvestigation.'

07:13.166 --> 07:15.000
Why is the FBI interested?

07:15.083 --> 07:17.834
It's quite a collection.

07:17.917 --> 07:19.375
My husband bought
those for me.

07:19.458 --> 07:22.000
Cute. What kind of
man was your husband?

07:22.083 --> 07:24.083
I know what you're asking.

07:24.166 --> 07:25.333
We had a good marriage.

07:25.417 --> 07:26.875
What, because
he bought you these?

07:26.959 --> 07:29.792
And he was very thoughtful.

07:29.875 --> 07:31.333
Sounds like.

07:33.375 --> 07:34.417
I'm sorry,
I don't see

07:34.500 --> 07:36.000
what this has to do
with his murder.

07:36.083 --> 07:40.041
If you could just tell us
what happened that night.

07:40.125 --> 07:41.458
Mel took
our dog for a walk

07:41.542 --> 07:44.792
and...was killed
by a stranger.

07:44.875 --> 07:47.250
One minute you're planning
a trip to the Galapagos

07:47.333 --> 07:49.375
and the next
you're shopping funerary urns.

07:49.458 --> 07:53.208
Did he ever live
or work in Upper Darby?

07:53.291 --> 07:54.709
Uh, not that I know--

07:54.792 --> 07:56.834
Anywhere in Delaware Country?

07:58.083 --> 07:59.583
- He was a homebody.
- Meaning what?

07:59.667 --> 08:01.709
You'd just sit around
sipping Sleepytime Tea

08:01.792 --> 08:03.625
and watching "60 Minutes?"

08:05.375 --> 08:08.458
Mel worked.
He...watched the
Phillies.

08:08.542 --> 08:09.792
He took walks.

08:09.875 --> 08:13.333
Our big excitement
was...dinner and a movie.

08:13.417 --> 08:15.709
Did he ever mention
the Darby View Drive-In?

08:15.792 --> 08:18.583
(Sally)
'Drive-In?'

08:18.667 --> 08:20.834
This is going to help
solve my husband's murder?

08:20.917 --> 08:22.625
Well, just answer
the question.

08:22.709 --> 08:24.750
I think I want you to leave.

08:24.834 --> 08:26.709
(Lilly)
'Interesting
interrogation technique.'

08:26.792 --> 08:27.834
You're a hand-holder.

08:27.917 --> 08:29.375
It works sometimes.

08:29.458 --> 08:31.542
- That woman lost her husband.
- I got that.

08:31.625 --> 08:34.000
As well as he liked the
Phillies
and walks in the park.

08:34.083 --> 08:35.542
It's a tragic loss,
to be sure.

08:35.625 --> 08:37.083
Well, she might've
given us something.

08:37.166 --> 08:39.458
I'm looking for connections,
not Facebook friends.

08:39.542 --> 08:40.875
She didn't know
who killed her husband

08:40.959 --> 08:43.583
and I needed to know that.

08:45.542 --> 08:47.917
Boss said these
belong to you.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.166
Diane Yates.

08:49.250 --> 08:50.959
Scotty Valens.

08:51.041 --> 08:52.542
You two partners?

08:52.625 --> 08:54.583
Hmm.

08:54.667 --> 08:56.375
What type of name
is that, Valens?

08:56.458 --> 08:58.333
Italian? Mexican?

08:58.417 --> 09:00.166
It's Cuban,
Puerto
Rican.

09:00.250 --> 09:01.959
As in Valenzuela?

09:02.041 --> 09:04.000
It's a shame
to shorten that.

09:04.083 --> 09:06.125
I dated a Latino once.

09:06.208 --> 09:08.959
All talk,
no follow through.

09:09.041 --> 09:10.667
You're dating
the wrong
Latinos.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.000
Well, I guess so.

09:12.083 --> 09:14.125
How about you put those
pretty brown eyes of yours

09:14.208 --> 09:15.875
to good use?

09:15.959 --> 09:17.375
And don't worry,
I don't bite.

09:17.458 --> 09:18.709
Anymore.

09:23.583 --> 09:27.792
I got grass, trees,
rocks, park bench.

09:27.875 --> 09:29.625
Well, there's something here.

09:31.834 --> 09:33.208
(Scotty)
'That could be
a homeless squat.'

09:33.291 --> 09:35.458
I don't recall
an interview in the file.

09:35.542 --> 09:37.291
They must've split
when they saw the
cops.

09:37.375 --> 09:40.208
Yeah, but it'd be nice
to know if he saw something.

09:40.291 --> 09:43.375
I'll call patrol.
Talk to the beat cop.

09:50.125 --> 09:51.542
I miss a spot shaving?

09:51.625 --> 09:53.166
Uh-huh.

09:53.250 --> 09:54.875
Just looking.

09:54.959 --> 09:57.375
Thinking you'd fit
right in at the bureau.

09:57.458 --> 09:59.000
You fill out a suit nicely

09:59.083 --> 10:01.250
and I'm sure you're
good at sucking up.

10:01.333 --> 10:03.500
- Minority doesn't hurt.
- Yeah.

10:03.583 --> 10:05.000
- I'll get right on that.
- Hmm.

10:05.083 --> 10:07.542
So what's the bureau
want with this case
anyway?

10:07.625 --> 10:10.667
What's it like working
with the bleach queen?

10:11.792 --> 10:14.542
Well, Lill and I
make a good team.

10:14.625 --> 10:16.125
Oh, I bet.

10:16.208 --> 10:18.458
- It's not like that.
- You're not her type?

10:19.792 --> 10:23.000
Thanks. The guy we're looking
for is Carl Guidry.

10:23.083 --> 10:24.500
The bum in the park?

10:24.583 --> 10:27.583
Patrol picked him up last week
for a visit to the psych ward.

10:27.667 --> 10:28.750
At St. Paul's.

10:29.792 --> 10:32.458
You remember
this place, Carl?

10:32.542 --> 10:35.959
Ah...yes.

10:36.834 --> 10:38.000
You stay there sometimes?

10:38.083 --> 10:39.375
Under my tree.

10:39.458 --> 10:42.041
Well, a man was shot
and killed there last
November.

10:42.125 --> 10:44.709
And, uh, we think you
might've seen it happen.

10:44.792 --> 10:46.583
No, I did not.

10:46.667 --> 10:49.000
It was right here
by the path.

10:49.083 --> 10:50.583
He was walking a dog.

10:50.667 --> 10:52.375
No, ma'am.
Final answer.

10:52.458 --> 10:56.500
Carl..
We know everything,
Carl.

10:57.834 --> 11:00.041
Everything inside
that head of yours.

11:00.125 --> 11:02.417
Even that girl.

11:02.500 --> 11:04.667
You have a problem with
people reading your thoughts?

11:06.291 --> 11:07.792
I want it to stop.

11:07.875 --> 11:11.417
(Diane)
'I can help you with that.'

11:11.500 --> 11:13.959
First, you have to help us.

11:14.041 --> 11:16.750
Take that.

11:16.834 --> 11:19.625
It'll keep
the intruders
out.

11:25.166 --> 11:26.834
That better?

11:26.917 --> 11:28.208
I think so.

11:28.291 --> 11:29.583
It must be working.

11:29.667 --> 11:30.917
Can I-I have another?

11:31.000 --> 11:33.959
After you tell us
about the
shooting.

11:34.041 --> 11:35.542
(Carl)
'O-okay.'

11:36.333 --> 11:38.917
I was right-right there.

12:00.208 --> 12:01.792
You leave when
you saw the police?

12:01.875 --> 12:04.375
I-I didn't want no trouble.

12:04.458 --> 12:06.000
The man in
the green jacket,
Carl.

12:06.083 --> 12:07.709
What was he
doing to the
body?

12:07.792 --> 12:10.500
Taking that gold watch.

12:10.583 --> 12:11.625
I suppose.

12:11.709 --> 12:14.083
How'd you know
about that watch, Carl?

12:19.333 --> 12:22.291
Did you take
the watch,
Carl?

12:23.709 --> 12:25.709
I took a few things.

12:27.041 --> 12:28.709
There goes
robbery as a
motive.

12:28.792 --> 12:30.125
But the shooter
checked the body.

12:30.208 --> 12:33.166
Making sure there was
no bullet left behind.

12:34.417 --> 12:35.625
Get something off
the homeless guy?

12:35.709 --> 12:37.166
Yeah. Saw the shooter.

12:37.250 --> 12:39.333
That's good.

12:39.417 --> 12:43.208
So, uh, Yates and
Stillman
had a thing.

12:43.291 --> 12:45.417
A thing, thing?

12:45.500 --> 12:46.583
It was what she said.

12:46.667 --> 12:48.166
And broke up his marriage.

12:48.250 --> 12:49.834
[sighs]
Wow.

12:49.917 --> 12:51.500
The bigger issue is, Cougar Town

12:51.583 --> 12:52.667
won't let me
in on what the
feds

12:52.750 --> 12:54.291
interest in this case is.

12:54.375 --> 12:57.250
Might have a connect
to Darby in Delaware
County.

12:57.333 --> 13:00.333
I'll dig around,
see what I can find.

13:00.417 --> 13:02.375
(John)
'Diane, I want you
to meet another member'

13:02.458 --> 13:03.792
of my team, Kat Miller.

13:03.875 --> 13:06.000
Can I talk to you?

13:06.083 --> 13:08.000
Nice to meet you too.

13:08.083 --> 13:09.333
You promised
to keep me in the
loop.

13:09.417 --> 13:11.125
I will,
but first I need Rush

13:11.208 --> 13:13.250
to walk me
through the crime scene.

13:16.333 --> 13:19.500
Shaver enters the park
approximately 9:30.

13:19.583 --> 13:22.000
I figure he keeps
to the lighted path.

13:25.291 --> 13:28.083
The killer waited in the
bushes
till he rounds the corner.

13:28.166 --> 13:30.125
Then confronts Shaver
and maybe something happens

13:30.208 --> 13:32.875
with the dog
or Shaver resists.

13:36.458 --> 13:39.542
Shot came from over there.

13:39.625 --> 13:42.375
[chuckles]
What, with a handgun?

13:42.458 --> 13:43.500
It's gotta be 100 yards.

13:43.583 --> 13:45.125
He used a rifle.

13:45.208 --> 13:48.917
[chuckles]
Well, not a lotta
thugs using long guns.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.875
Shaver enters
the shooting lane

13:50.959 --> 13:52.625
<i>illuminated</i>
<i>by the street lamp.</i>

13:53.750 --> 13:55.875
It's a perfect shot.

13:55.959 --> 13:58.875
It puts the trajectory..

14:02.500 --> 14:03.750
'...here.'

14:06.375 --> 14:08.917
You gonna
tell me what's going on?

14:09.000 --> 14:11.125
We gotta get
this back to ballistics.

14:11.208 --> 14:14.375
Look, I don't give a crap how
far back you and Stillman go.

14:14.458 --> 14:16.417
'You want to keep shining
me on, go ahead.'

14:16.500 --> 14:17.834
I'll call my own friend
in the bureau.

14:17.917 --> 14:19.834
I'm your friend
in the bureau.

14:21.625 --> 14:24.583
We have
a serial killer, a sniper.

14:24.667 --> 14:25.917
Are there other cases
to back this up?

14:26.000 --> 14:28.375
''Cause I don't
recall other unsolveds'

14:28.458 --> 14:29.542
with a rifle.

14:29.625 --> 14:31.583
Last one was 27 years ago

14:31.667 --> 14:34.709
and it looks like
he came out of retirement.

14:40.917 --> 14:43.333
- Where's Yates?
- Oh, down at ballistics.

14:43.417 --> 14:45.208
Found this.

14:45.291 --> 14:48.125
- Darby View Drive-In, 1980.
- Shooting never solved.

14:48.208 --> 14:50.875
Only evidence was a rifle
bullet
recovered from the victim.

14:50.959 --> 14:52.125
.25-06.

14:52.208 --> 14:53.792
Well, Yates thinks
the Shaver murder

14:53.875 --> 14:55.875
is the work
of a serial sniper.

14:55.959 --> 14:57.875
Uh, might have
heard if a
sniper

14:57.959 --> 15:00.125
who was picking off
folks in our
backyard.

15:00.208 --> 15:01.709
And they sent one agent?

15:01.792 --> 15:03.125
Feds come two to a box.

15:03.208 --> 15:06.125
Well, I figure, boss vouches
for her, she must be good.

15:06.208 --> 15:09.792
What if the task force blows
in and starts barking orders?

15:14.709 --> 15:16.542
- Hey, Nick.
- Hey.

15:16.625 --> 15:19.375
Uh. Kicked me early.

15:19.458 --> 15:23.083
Got those files from
the Billingsley case for
you.

15:23.166 --> 15:26.041
- Just coffee, Fay. Thanks.
- You got it.

15:26.125 --> 15:28.208
Trying to help
the family out, you know?

15:28.291 --> 15:30.166
You talk to the warden?

15:30.250 --> 15:32.041
They investigated
Joe Don's
shanking.

15:32.125 --> 15:34.333
It turns out,
he cut the chow
line

15:34.417 --> 15:36.375
and the gang took offense.

15:37.750 --> 15:39.750
Well, that's on me.

15:39.834 --> 15:42.208
No, you can't keep
beating
yourself up about this,
Nick.

15:42.291 --> 15:44.000
No, I can't look
the other way either.

15:44.083 --> 15:46.333
Well, do the work,
get your head
right.

15:47.333 --> 15:49.083
What's that
supposed to mean?

15:49.166 --> 15:50.500
Well, it means,
it's gonna be a
while

15:50.583 --> 15:53.000
before you're cleared
back to active duty.

15:54.166 --> 15:55.750
I'm good to go.

15:57.750 --> 15:59.542
Worked with a guy in Vice.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.959
He had a meltdown,
his wife left him.

16:02.041 --> 16:03.667
Substance abuse.

16:03.750 --> 16:07.542
- Brass had him take a powder.
- Yeah?

16:07.625 --> 16:10.166
Well, he was chomping at the
bit to get back on the line.

16:10.250 --> 16:13.959
He got cleared,
comes back all
smiles.

16:14.041 --> 16:17.125
Two weeks later, I found
him dead in his squad
car.

16:20.709 --> 16:22.792
I'm not that guy.

16:24.834 --> 16:27.208
Take as much time
as you need, Nick.

16:28.458 --> 16:31.375
We'll be here
for you when you're
ready.

16:34.709 --> 16:35.959
Hey.

16:36.041 --> 16:37.583
You gotta fluff
half the boys in the lab

16:37.667 --> 16:39.208
to get a report
back around here.

16:39.291 --> 16:41.625
Come back a .25-06?

16:43.458 --> 16:45.000
Same bullet
that killed Barry
Jensen

16:45.083 --> 16:47.500
at the Darby View Drive-In.

16:47.583 --> 16:48.834
Nice.

16:50.208 --> 16:51.500
Yes.

16:51.583 --> 16:54.542
Preliminary ballistics
makes it a match.

16:54.625 --> 16:55.875
Well, the same
shooter then?

16:55.959 --> 16:57.917
You think?

16:58.000 --> 16:59.250
You know,
if you want my
help

16:59.333 --> 17:01.291
you need to tell
me what's going
on.

17:02.625 --> 17:03.750
How about we get a drink?

17:05.041 --> 17:06.458
If you're 12-stepping
you can sip

17:06.542 --> 17:09.041
diet soda
and silently judge me.

17:10.667 --> 17:13.750
(Diane)
'I can attribute
five shootings to our guy.'

17:13.834 --> 17:16.542
- Victims linked?
- If only.

17:16.625 --> 17:19.291
Kid on his way
to college, bus driver

17:19.375 --> 17:23.917
secretary, roofer,
and now the tax attorney.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.500
And the first one
at the drive-in.

17:25.583 --> 17:27.333
Three more
after that and then

17:27.417 --> 17:28.917
nothing for 27 years.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.291
I thought he was
dead or in prison.

17:31.375 --> 17:33.041
Then the Shaver
shooting pops.

17:33.125 --> 17:35.959
Same MO, a single shot
to the chest.

17:36.041 --> 17:38.000
No bullet left behind.

17:38.083 --> 17:40.125
You've been hunting
this guy for 30 years?

17:40.208 --> 17:42.208
Oh, I must have chased
down a dozen cases

17:42.291 --> 17:43.709
I thought fit the pattern.

17:43.792 --> 17:45.667
Calling in the task force?

17:45.750 --> 17:47.417
Nope.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.875
First homicide was right
around the corner here.

17:49.959 --> 17:51.625
Frank's Coffee Shop.

17:51.709 --> 17:54.750
Double murder,
waitress, manager.

17:56.834 --> 17:57.792
First on the scene?

17:57.875 --> 17:58.959
Took initial statements

17:59.041 --> 18:01.250
and right away
I liked the busboy for it.

18:01.333 --> 18:03.125
And then
the detectives show up.

18:03.208 --> 18:05.375
Oh. Yeah, didn't
see it the same
way.

18:05.458 --> 18:06.500
No. I try telling 'em

18:06.583 --> 18:10.000
but they liked
the ex-con grill cook.

18:10.083 --> 18:11.750
The lead laughed in my face.

18:11.834 --> 18:15.208
Told me to shut my trap
and secure his crime scene.

18:15.291 --> 18:17.000
Oh, I remember
a few of those
myself.

18:17.083 --> 18:19.542
Well, the last thing
we need is some fed profiler

18:19.625 --> 18:21.917
telling us what kind of
underwear our shooter favors

18:22.000 --> 18:23.709
or that he had mommy issues.

18:26.166 --> 18:28.375
Another round.

18:28.458 --> 18:29.959
One for him.

18:32.750 --> 18:35.625
Amstel Light at the end
of the bar is kind of cute.

18:39.500 --> 18:40.500
You seeing anyone?

18:40.583 --> 18:42.125
Uh, was.

18:42.208 --> 18:43.917
Another cop?

18:44.000 --> 18:45.250
Yeah.

18:45.333 --> 18:47.000
Ah.

18:47.083 --> 18:49.458
You're looking
for the real thing.

18:49.542 --> 18:50.834
'Good luck.'

18:50.917 --> 18:52.208
Only took me 30 years

18:52.291 --> 18:54.041
but I stopped believing
in that nonsense

18:54.125 --> 18:56.208
when I figured out
what men want.

18:56.291 --> 18:59.542
- What's that?
- A girlfriend, not a wife.

19:11.291 --> 19:12.542
(John)
'Alright, Philly PD'

19:12.625 --> 19:15.542
will work jointly with
Agent Yates and the
FBI.

19:15.625 --> 19:16.959
Got five shootings.

19:17.041 --> 19:20.166
The first in 1980,
the last five months
ago.

19:20.250 --> 19:22.333
Agent Yates
will run the rest for
you.

19:22.417 --> 19:24.041
With the exception
of the first shooting

19:24.125 --> 19:27.417
the killer chose isolated
targets minimizing his
exposure.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.250
This guy is patient,
smart, and careful.

19:30.333 --> 19:32.250
Safe to assume
military service.

19:32.333 --> 19:33.959
Four victims
either lived, worked

19:34.041 --> 19:35.959
or had ties
to Delaware County.

19:36.041 --> 19:39.166
First victim, Barry Jensen,
shot at a drive-in, 1980.

19:39.250 --> 19:40.458
Any witnesses?

19:40.542 --> 19:42.125
No. I've already done
the legwork on that.

19:42.208 --> 19:44.333
- There's nothing there.
- Felicity Andrews,
secretary.

19:44.417 --> 19:47.625
Shot in her car
in New Jersey in 1981.

19:47.709 --> 19:50.000
Assigned theorized
a carjacking gone wrong.

19:50.083 --> 19:51.792
Preston Schmall,
part-time roofer

19:51.875 --> 19:54.542
shot in the Poconos
while camping, 1982.

19:54.625 --> 19:56.291
Next was Fred
Norris,
a bus driver

19:56.375 --> 19:58.583
shot in '83
near the bus grounds.

19:58.667 --> 20:00.083
(John)
'And now Shaver,
the tax attorney'

20:00.166 --> 20:01.792
shot just five months ago.

20:01.875 --> 20:03.041
Any casing recovered?

20:03.125 --> 20:04.208
No, but we have the bullet

20:04.291 --> 20:05.375
that killed Shaver.

20:05.458 --> 20:07.291
Matches the first victim, 1980.

20:07.375 --> 20:08.875
Alright,
re-interview
family, friends

20:08.959 --> 20:10.250
any folks at those scenes.

20:10.333 --> 20:12.375
See if
something
was missed.

20:13.500 --> 20:15.542
Interview the bus driver.

20:15.625 --> 20:18.500
Oh. You want me
to interview the bus driver?

20:18.583 --> 20:19.834
Well, you can
relate
culturally.

20:19.917 --> 20:22.208
Just right
on the surface, huh?

20:22.291 --> 20:23.750
You got a problem
with that report me

20:23.834 --> 20:25.750
to Reverend Al
after we find this guy.

20:27.041 --> 20:29.000
Why are y'all coming
around now on Fred?

20:29.083 --> 20:30.500
Reopening his murder.

20:30.583 --> 20:32.375
Well, it's about time.

20:32.458 --> 20:33.959
You two friends?

20:34.041 --> 20:36.625
Played tonk
every Friday
night.

20:36.709 --> 20:38.625
Didn't have
any family
just..

20:38.709 --> 20:40.583
...just the
regulars
on his route.

20:40.667 --> 20:42.500
What happened
that night, Calvin?

20:42.583 --> 20:44.792
Well, I was getting
ready
for my next shift.

20:45.959 --> 20:48.041
Catching some Zs
on the bus and..

20:49.375 --> 20:51.500
...and that's when
I,
that's when I heard
it.

21:16.834 --> 21:17.959
Freddie?

21:19.291 --> 21:20.375
(Calvin)
'Hey, what are you doing?'

21:20.458 --> 21:22.834
Get help!
He's been
shot!

21:24.250 --> 21:26.583
I thought it was
one of Freddie's
jokes.

21:26.667 --> 21:28.500
We were always
pranking each
other.

21:28.583 --> 21:31.417
This other guy,
Black, White?

21:31.500 --> 21:32.709
White, when I came back

21:32.792 --> 21:34.875
from making the phone
call,
he was gone.

21:34.959 --> 21:37.333
Anything you remember
about him?

21:37.417 --> 21:39.208
Green army jacket.

21:40.417 --> 21:42.834
Just never
made any sense to me.

21:42.917 --> 21:45.375
Felicity was going to
get her radiology degree.

21:45.458 --> 21:46.875
And you worked together
before she took

21:46.959 --> 21:48.041
the job
at the high
school?

21:48.125 --> 21:49.542
At Philly Savings and Loan.

21:49.625 --> 21:52.542
- Secretaries?
- Executive assistants.

21:52.625 --> 21:54.709
Just a nicer way
of saying the same thing.

21:54.792 --> 21:56.166
We covered for
the loan officers

21:56.250 --> 21:58.166
making promises
they couldn't keep.

21:58.250 --> 22:00.709
Were there a lot of
angry folks back
then?

22:00.792 --> 22:02.083
Oh, you bet.

22:02.166 --> 22:04.750
Spent most of the time
answering
phones, getting yelled at.

22:04.834 --> 22:06.875
Um, Felicity get
in the middle of
something?

22:06.959 --> 22:09.625
I remember this one guy
who kept calling

22:09.709 --> 22:11.792
but that was years before
she was murdered.

22:11.875 --> 22:14.709
- You got a name?
- Just a nickname.

22:14.792 --> 22:16.959
Mr. 6.83.

22:17.041 --> 22:20.166
A rate the manager promised
him but couldn't deliver.

22:25.417 --> 22:26.583
You wanna get lunch?

22:26.667 --> 22:28.250
They have a new salad bar
at Maxwell's.

22:32.500 --> 22:34.375
Felicity, aren't you
going to answer it?

22:34.458 --> 22:37.000
I can't. It's
him,
I just know
it.

22:37.083 --> 22:38.500
Mr. 6.83?

22:38.583 --> 22:39.667
He called
three times this
morning

22:39.750 --> 22:40.792
and I think
he followed me

22:40.875 --> 22:41.917
into the parking
lot
the other day.

22:44.917 --> 22:46.125
Philly Savings and Loan.

22:46.208 --> 22:47.917
(man #1)
'I want answers.'

22:48.000 --> 22:49.458
'You promised me that rate.'

22:49.542 --> 22:51.041
And I want a new Cadillac

22:51.125 --> 22:53.125
and a boyfriend that
looks like Robert Redford.

22:53.208 --> 22:54.750
- Nance!
- 'Where is she?'

22:54.834 --> 22:56.542
'The blonde
that keeps lying to me'

22:56.625 --> 22:58.709
'saying that
my loan's gonna go through?'

22:58.792 --> 23:00.625
Would you like to speak
to a manager?

23:00.709 --> 23:02.500
'You're all liars.'

23:02.583 --> 23:04.709
Drop dead, creep!

23:12.041 --> 23:14.458
It got so bad,
she finally quit.

23:14.542 --> 23:16.792
Good thing, 'cause the bank
went belly-up a year later.

23:16.875 --> 23:19.166
Did she know
this guy's
name?

23:19.250 --> 23:20.959
I don't remember.

23:21.041 --> 23:23.250
Like I said, there were
a lot of angry people

23:23.333 --> 23:25.917
with the recession and all.

23:27.375 --> 23:29.792
So you were there
when Preston was shot?

23:31.583 --> 23:33.625
Not exactly.

23:33.709 --> 23:36.166
You told police that
you
were on the trail with
him.

23:37.375 --> 23:40.333
I-I wasn't with him
at the time.

23:40.417 --> 23:42.125
- Did you see the shooter?
- No.

23:42.208 --> 23:44.959
The police said it was
a stray bullet from a poacher.

23:45.041 --> 23:48.083
So you went hiking
but just not
together?

23:49.333 --> 23:51.959
We weren't exactly
getting along.

23:52.041 --> 23:55.375
We went camping
hoping to reconnect.

23:55.458 --> 23:56.500
A little late?

23:56.583 --> 23:57.750
You filed
for
separation

23:57.834 --> 23:59.583
a week before
he was killed.

24:01.583 --> 24:03.500
Did you tell him?

24:05.250 --> 24:07.667
We argued,
he ran into the woods.

24:07.750 --> 24:09.208
That's the last time
I saw him.

24:09.291 --> 24:11.834
Well, why lie about
being
there when he was shot?

24:14.125 --> 24:16.375
It was like that
police officer knew.

24:16.458 --> 24:19.166
- Knew what?
- That it was my fault
somehow.

24:19.250 --> 24:21.500
It felt like
I had been set free.

24:21.583 --> 24:23.917
I know that sounds terrible,
but it's the truth.

24:24.750 --> 24:26.125
A happy accident.

24:26.208 --> 24:28.917
It's funny, I hadn't thought
about Preston in years

24:29.000 --> 24:31.041
and then last month
I ran into his sister

24:31.125 --> 24:33.959
and she told me that
one of his gambling buddies

24:34.041 --> 24:36.041
had been shot
upstate New York.

24:36.125 --> 24:37.333
Shot and killed?

24:37.417 --> 24:40.125
No, he survived.

24:40.208 --> 24:42.458
You don't think
there's a connection, do you?

24:42.542 --> 24:44.291
Can you give us a name?

24:44.375 --> 24:45.917
Tim Hudson.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.542
He'd hire Preston
to help him repo cars.

24:50.291 --> 24:52.166
(Kat)
Bus driver saw the killer
at the scene.

24:52.250 --> 24:53.709
(Diane)
Checking for a bullet.

24:53.792 --> 24:55.542
(Kat)
Trying to, until
he was interrupted.

24:55.625 --> 24:56.750
(John)
What about the secretary?

24:56.834 --> 24:58.041
A disgruntled bank customer

24:58.125 --> 24:59.375
might've been stalking her.

24:59.458 --> 25:01.041
Pull the loan records
from that period, Scotty

25:01.125 --> 25:02.542
match them
against military servers

25:02.625 --> 25:03.583
people in the system.

25:03.667 --> 25:05.250
Well, we got something.

25:05.333 --> 25:07.166
(Lilly)
'Found a survivor, Tim
Hudson.'

25:07.250 --> 25:10.291
Worked as a repo man
with victim number three.

25:10.375 --> 25:11.542
Preston Schmall.

25:11.625 --> 25:14.000
Wounded in
a drug-related shooting.

25:16.709 --> 25:19.667
Remember how I said
I'd keep you in the
loop?

25:19.750 --> 25:21.709
You know, I'm cutting you
a lot of slack, Diane

25:21.792 --> 25:23.041
on account of our history.

25:23.125 --> 25:25.250
This guy's out
there,
John, I know it.

25:25.333 --> 25:27.458
I'm gonna protect my people
if it turns into a turf war.

25:27.542 --> 25:29.083
It's not going to.

25:29.166 --> 25:31.750
Besides, Rush doesn't
need any protecting.

25:31.834 --> 25:33.250
I just want that out there.

25:33.333 --> 25:35.625
Let's put away
the badges, huh?

25:36.333 --> 25:38.166
[sighs]
Sorry.

25:39.709 --> 25:42.125
Always did take you
three drinks to loosen
up.

25:44.750 --> 25:46.458
How's your mother?

25:47.709 --> 25:49.542
She can't remember my name.

25:50.875 --> 25:52.959
She spends her days
listening to the
radio

25:53.041 --> 25:56.000
and...humming to herself.

25:56.083 --> 25:57.250
Well, it happens.

25:57.333 --> 25:59.500
When that day comes,
shoot me dead.

25:59.583 --> 26:02.917
Here's to knowing
when to fold.

26:06.583 --> 26:08.709
It's been
a long time,
John.

26:11.041 --> 26:13.625
Too long.

26:13.709 --> 26:16.041
No hard feelings.

26:16.125 --> 26:19.083
I wasn't a boy.
We both knew the game.

26:19.166 --> 26:21.625
I wasn't the one married.

26:23.709 --> 26:25.834
Well, it would've ended, anyway.

26:30.542 --> 26:32.542
Another one?

26:32.625 --> 26:33.750
I better not.

26:33.834 --> 26:36.250
I don't wanna regret
anything in the morning.

26:38.583 --> 26:40.583
I won't if you won't.

26:44.625 --> 26:46.792
You know what?

26:48.041 --> 26:49.291
I'm toast.

26:49.375 --> 26:51.166
Why don't you
give me a ride home?

26:51.250 --> 26:54.333
I'll, uh...I'll call you a cab.

26:57.125 --> 27:00.000
Grab your keys
and take me home.

27:00.083 --> 27:03.458
Or I'll get one of these
other young bucks to do it.

27:27.083 --> 27:28.041
Remember Preston?

27:30.875 --> 27:33.792
Hard guy to forget.

27:33.875 --> 27:34.750
What did he do?

27:34.834 --> 27:36.875
He was shot and killed in '82.

27:36.959 --> 27:40.208
Oh, must've rubbed
the wrong person the wrong way.

27:40.291 --> 27:42.875
Preston wasn't half as
charming as he thought he was.

27:42.959 --> 27:45.542
A little odd that Preston
gets shot and killed

27:45.625 --> 27:49.208
and...then a year later,
you get shot?

27:49.291 --> 27:51.291
Police said it was
probably a stickup.

27:51.375 --> 27:52.542
Probably?

27:52.625 --> 27:55.291
Ah, I had to take
their word for it.

27:55.375 --> 27:56.583
Why is that?

27:56.667 --> 27:59.083
Fifth of Old Crow,
half a dozen
beaners

27:59.166 --> 28:01.083
a little herb
to even it all
out.

28:01.166 --> 28:02.625
One minute I'm
sailing,
the next minute

28:02.709 --> 28:04.542
I'm waking up
in the
hospital

28:04.625 --> 28:06.417
and they're telling me
I'll never walk again.

28:06.500 --> 28:08.333
You don't
remember anything?

28:08.417 --> 28:10.333
I got whole years
missing, lady.

28:11.583 --> 28:14.000
Cops said I was in a
bad
hood trying to score.

28:14.709 --> 28:16.417
Sounds good to me.

28:16.500 --> 28:17.875
It's like
the hand of God

28:17.959 --> 28:19.875
just came down
and gave me a
crack.

28:19.959 --> 28:21.583
Just changed your ways, huh?

28:21.667 --> 28:23.875
Been clean
and sober ever
since.

28:23.959 --> 28:25.792
Of course
I, uh, can't
walk.

28:25.875 --> 28:28.000
But that
is a small price to
pay

28:28.083 --> 28:30.917
for getting me
off the road I was
on.

28:31.041 --> 28:34.000
You and Preston work
for a repo company?

28:34.083 --> 28:36.125
Hmm. Just me.

28:36.208 --> 28:37.834
Recession was good
for business.

28:37.917 --> 28:39.792
I had so much work,
I'd toss Preston

28:39.875 --> 28:41.500
a couple of bucks
now and then to give me a hand

28:41.583 --> 28:43.291
especially if I was
in a bad neighborhood.

28:43.375 --> 28:44.333
Why is that?

28:44.417 --> 28:45.417
People don't
exactly invite

28:45.500 --> 28:46.834
you in for
milk and cookies

28:46.917 --> 28:49.834
when you're taking
their car or their color TV.

28:49.917 --> 28:52.250
You guys ever get
into it with a customer?

28:52.333 --> 28:55.125
Oh, from time to time.
Mostly words.

28:55.208 --> 28:58.875
Well, maybe a vet or,
you know, a guy in the
military.

28:58.959 --> 29:00.792
One guy I remember.

29:00.875 --> 29:02.500
Intense son of a bitch.

29:12.458 --> 29:13.458
Watch my back.

29:19.333 --> 29:20.333
Come on, man.

29:28.750 --> 29:30.375
(male #1)
Hey! Hey!

29:30.458 --> 29:31.667
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

29:31.750 --> 29:33.917
You're behind six months
on your payments.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.333
Just doing our jobs, man.

29:35.417 --> 29:36.834
Oh, what, take things
that don't belong to
you?

29:36.917 --> 29:39.083
The car belongs
to the bank now.

29:39.166 --> 29:41.083
Come on, man, I need
that car to get to my
job.

29:41.166 --> 29:43.625
Here's an idea.
Get a bus pass.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.333
I was gonna pay.

29:46.417 --> 29:48.083
Come on, I can't afford
to lose this job, guys.

29:48.166 --> 29:50.250
Unless you can pay
the delinquent amount

29:50.333 --> 29:53.083
in full right now..

29:55.041 --> 29:56.709
Times are tough,
Boudreaux.

29:56.792 --> 29:58.709
Knock it off, Preston.

29:58.792 --> 30:00.625
Hey, did you serve?

30:00.709 --> 30:02.166
Yeah, what about it?

30:02.250 --> 30:04.500
First Division,
Bravo Company.

30:04.583 --> 30:06.667
So we're supposed to give you
the Semper Fi break?

30:06.750 --> 30:08.125
Can't do that.

30:08.208 --> 30:11.125
Look, I come back empty-handed,
guess what? I lose my job.

30:11.208 --> 30:12.667
Come on, I'm trying
real hard here, man.

30:12.750 --> 30:13.959
Try harder.

30:14.041 --> 30:15.417
- You know what--
- Hey, hey, hey!

30:15.500 --> 30:16.875
- 'Back off!'
- 'Stop it!'

30:16.959 --> 30:19.000
- Hey, stop! Stop it!
- Hey!

30:22.125 --> 30:24.583
Someday somebody's gonna
take something from you, pal.

30:24.667 --> 30:27.667
Something real important,
and you're gonna remember me

30:27.750 --> 30:28.709
when that happens.

30:28.792 --> 30:30.125
Go back inside.

30:30.208 --> 30:31.375
You-you wait.

30:31.458 --> 30:34.208
You're gonna get
yours,
Boudreaux.

30:39.500 --> 30:41.458
(Lilly)
'Marines don't
make idle threats.'

30:41.542 --> 30:42.500
They take action.

30:42.583 --> 30:43.709
He was pretty steamed

30:43.792 --> 30:46.875
but, uh, this was years
before I got shot.

30:46.959 --> 30:48.000
You remember a name?

30:48.083 --> 30:49.250
Just the car.

30:49.333 --> 30:51.000
Ford Torino.

30:51.083 --> 30:53.417
Must've been '76 or so.

30:55.417 --> 30:58.500
Boss, pulled
repo company records.

30:58.583 --> 31:00.417
A dozen cars match
Hudson's description.

31:00.500 --> 31:01.917
We cross-referenced
the names with

31:02.000 --> 31:04.291
Philly Savings and
Loan
records, got a hit.

31:04.375 --> 31:07.125
Bill Shepard, ex-marine,
served in Vietnam.

31:07.208 --> 31:08.792
Well, he knows his
way around a gun.

31:08.875 --> 31:11.917
Owned the Darby View
Drive-In.
Tried to get a loan.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.750
Connected to every victim
except
the bus driver and Mel Shaver.

31:14.834 --> 31:16.500
Shepard went off
the grid in the
'80s.

31:16.583 --> 31:19.417
No credit card
statements,
zero bank activity.

31:19.500 --> 31:22.291
Yates ran the name through
the FBI database and got a
hit.

31:22.375 --> 31:25.041
Lifetime subscriber
to "The Long Rifle
Review."

31:25.125 --> 31:26.083
That a crime?

31:26.166 --> 31:27.250
Post-Oklahoma City

31:27.333 --> 31:28.959
gets you
on a watch
list.

31:29.041 --> 31:31.625
Searching tax records
trying
to track down an address.

31:31.709 --> 31:34.166
Rush located his
son,
Paul Shepard.

31:36.375 --> 31:37.625
A month overdue.

31:37.709 --> 31:39.792
And it's my fault
I gotta charge late fees.
Heh.

31:39.875 --> 31:42.333
Agent Yates.
This is Detective Rush.

31:42.417 --> 31:44.417
Looking for your
father,
Bill Shepard.

31:44.500 --> 31:45.792
Well, that makes
two of us.

31:45.875 --> 31:48.250
You're gonna have
to do better than
that.

31:48.333 --> 31:49.250
What's this about?

31:49.333 --> 31:50.458
Your father's a suspect

31:50.542 --> 31:53.125
in a series of
unsolved
shootings.

31:53.208 --> 31:55.291
- What?
- He in contact with you?

31:55.375 --> 31:57.458
He ran off
and left me when I was 14.

31:57.542 --> 32:00.500
Had to go live with my aunt
and uncle in New Jersey.

32:00.583 --> 32:01.709
Just took off?

32:01.792 --> 32:04.041
- He lost everything.
- A drive-in?

32:04.125 --> 32:07.166
(Paul)
'Yeah, pretty good business
back in the '70s.'

32:07.250 --> 32:09.667
Then they started
opening multiplexes.

32:09.750 --> 32:10.834
He try to hold on?

32:10.917 --> 32:13.250
For a while.
He loved that place.

32:13.333 --> 32:16.333
He used to love
watching people watch movies.

32:16.417 --> 32:17.709
It looks like
you
caught the
bug.

32:17.792 --> 32:20.291
Well, it was hard not to.

32:20.375 --> 32:23.333
You know, my father
was his own worst enemy.

32:23.417 --> 32:24.500
He should've sold the place.

32:24.583 --> 32:25.959
Instead, the bank took it.

32:26.041 --> 32:28.375
So what did he do
after he lost the
drive-in?

32:28.458 --> 32:30.792
He started drinking.

32:30.875 --> 32:33.583
I still remember the day
the dad I knew was gone.

32:48.709 --> 32:49.875
How you folks doing today?

32:49.959 --> 32:51.166
Just going to the park.

32:51.250 --> 32:53.458
- Nice day for it.
- 'Yeah.'

32:56.208 --> 32:57.583
You need a little more.

32:57.667 --> 32:59.333
Uh..

33:02.041 --> 33:03.583
Come on, you know me.

33:03.667 --> 33:06.583
Sorry. Full fare
required for rides.

33:06.667 --> 33:07.750
Those are the rules.

33:10.458 --> 33:11.750
Hey, uh..

33:13.959 --> 33:15.625
Can anyone spot me 50 cents?

33:15.709 --> 33:16.959
Hmm.

33:18.333 --> 33:19.417
Come on, man.

33:19.500 --> 33:21.208
Don't embarrass me
in front of my boy.

33:21.291 --> 33:23.959
- It's okay. We can walk.
- No, it's not okay, son.

33:24.041 --> 33:26.625
I've got my other passengers
to take care of.

33:26.709 --> 33:28.041
'I'm sorry, sir.'

33:28.125 --> 33:29.667
'There's nothing
I can do for you.'

33:29.750 --> 33:31.500
You're gonna
throw me off the
bus?

33:31.583 --> 33:32.917
(Fred)
'I need you to step out.'

33:35.875 --> 33:38.959
Look, you can get a free
bus pass at the shelter.

33:52.166 --> 33:53.834
A month later, he said
he was going up north

33:53.917 --> 33:55.875
to look for a job
at a mill.

33:55.959 --> 33:57.458
That the last
you saw of him?

33:57.542 --> 33:58.625
Mm-hmm.

33:58.709 --> 34:00.625
He-he was never mean
or anything like that.

34:00.709 --> 34:03.834
Just...broken.

34:03.917 --> 34:05.458
That the number six bus?

34:05.542 --> 34:07.542
I think so.

34:07.625 --> 34:09.792
He used to take it
all the time.

34:09.875 --> 34:13.583
Well, that driver was
shot
a couple years later.

34:13.667 --> 34:16.458
So, back then, you think
that my father was..

34:16.542 --> 34:18.333
We think
he's still out
there.

34:18.417 --> 34:19.875
[cellphone ringing]
We'll put a tap on your phones

34:19.959 --> 34:21.291
in case he tries to reach you.

34:21.375 --> 34:22.875
Excuse me.

34:22.959 --> 34:24.583
You know,
I-I haven't seen or heard

34:24.667 --> 34:25.792
from him in 30 years.

34:25.875 --> 34:27.750
Anyplace
he might've gone
to?

34:29.250 --> 34:32.458
I-I spent half my life trying
to forget what happened.

34:34.083 --> 34:36.875
Traced his VA checks
to a PO box in Mount Pocono.

34:36.959 --> 34:39.250
The clerk there's
pulling up a home address.

34:39.875 --> 34:40.917
Let's go.

34:42.250 --> 34:44.458
The guy we're looking
for is Walt.

34:44.542 --> 34:46.291
Postal clerk for 40 years.

34:46.375 --> 34:48.083
Bill Shepard
still rents a box?

34:48.166 --> 34:51.667
Yeah, all rentals have
physical addresses on
file.

34:51.750 --> 34:54.834
Clerk said he just
needed
to locate the records.

34:54.917 --> 34:56.250
A good place
to hide out from the world

34:56.333 --> 34:58.417
and plot your revenge.

35:04.250 --> 35:05.208
Walt?

35:05.291 --> 35:07.125
FBI. We spoke on the phone.

35:07.208 --> 35:08.166
Pretty la..

35:10.000 --> 35:12.542
Get him!
I got you
covered.

35:16.291 --> 35:17.458
Let's get him out of there.

35:21.083 --> 35:23.041
- 'You got him?'
- 'Yeah.'

35:24.417 --> 35:27.000
(Diane)
'We need backup now!'

35:27.083 --> 35:29.750
Hold on. Hold on!

35:34.333 --> 35:36.291
(John)
We got an eyewitness
saw a black Chevy van

35:36.375 --> 35:38.000
speeding away
after
the shooting.

35:38.083 --> 35:39.542
What about
the postal clerk?

35:39.625 --> 35:40.542
Critical.

35:41.834 --> 35:44.208
Ugh, here come
the FBI storm-troopers.

35:52.125 --> 35:54.458
Hey, John, I'll
keep
you out of this.

35:54.542 --> 35:55.625
Keep me out of what?

35:55.709 --> 35:57.625
I wasn't exactly
cleared
to work this case.

35:57.709 --> 35:59.166
What?

36:00.417 --> 36:02.375
(Diane)
'Hey, Ryan.'

36:02.458 --> 36:03.709
How's your mother?

36:03.792 --> 36:05.542
Forgot how charming
you could be, Ryan.

36:05.625 --> 36:07.375
And I forgot
how reckless you could
be

36:07.458 --> 36:09.583
Special Agent Yates.

36:09.667 --> 36:11.959
Told her section boss
she was on her way to Philly

36:12.041 --> 36:13.250
to look after
her sick mother.

36:13.333 --> 36:14.667
I know, I stepped in it.

36:14.750 --> 36:16.000
Now, is that an apology?

36:16.083 --> 36:17.917
I'm sorry for being right
about this guy.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.583
I can see that.

36:19.667 --> 36:22.500
Now, I'm sure the family of
the
postal clerk will understand.

36:22.583 --> 36:24.500
John Stillman, Philly PD.

36:24.583 --> 36:27.375
Ryan Cavanaugh.
Special Agent in charge.

36:27.458 --> 36:30.333
Detective Lilly Rush.

36:30.417 --> 36:33.083
Agent Yates had no
authority
to investigate this case.

36:33.166 --> 36:36.125
You had full knowledge
of my interest in this case.

36:36.208 --> 36:38.291
Over here, Yates.

36:40.333 --> 36:41.709
(Ryan)
'You breached protocol'

36:41.792 --> 36:44.125
misled a major
metropolitan
police department.

36:44.208 --> 36:45.250
Do you rehearse this, Ryan?

36:45.333 --> 36:46.583
A man is in critical condition

36:46.667 --> 36:49.041
who was in the
presence
of an FBI agent

36:49.125 --> 36:50.250
and a police detective.

36:50.333 --> 36:52.083
That's a page one
screw up, Yates.

36:52.166 --> 36:53.709
You want to hang me
out to dry, do it.

36:53.792 --> 36:56.166
But you're gonna need them
if you wanna catch this guy.

36:56.250 --> 36:58.208
We've already coordinated
with the state police.

36:58.291 --> 37:00.000
Yeah, SWAT teams
are on their way.

37:00.083 --> 37:01.625
Philly PD
can assist
provided

37:01.709 --> 37:03.917
everything goes
through our command.

37:04.000 --> 37:07.458
I need to debrief you. Now.

37:07.542 --> 37:10.458
Could've told me
the truth, Diane.

37:14.041 --> 37:15.250
I'll liaison with the feds

37:15.333 --> 37:17.166
make sure we don't
get pushed aside.

37:17.250 --> 37:19.208
We'll head to the
hospital,
wait for the clerk.

37:19.291 --> 37:20.500
Still in surgery,
last I heard.

37:20.583 --> 37:21.959
Well, guy must
have
known something

37:22.041 --> 37:23.875
our killer didn't
want anybody else to
find.

37:23.959 --> 37:25.917
If he pulls through,
we'll question him.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.125
Get him to ID
Bill Shepard.

37:27.208 --> 37:28.542
What he looks like now.

37:31.500 --> 37:33.208
(Ryan)
'Interstate narco traffic.'

37:33.291 --> 37:34.792
(Diane)
'Yeah, at least
I'm out in the field.'

37:34.875 --> 37:36.333
(Ryan)
'At what point did you
decide'

37:36.417 --> 37:38.250
'you could just run your own
investigation, Yates?'

37:38.333 --> 37:39.792
(Diane)
'That day in your office,
Ryan'

37:39.875 --> 37:41.834
'when you were too busy
to hear my evidence.'

37:41.917 --> 37:43.458
(Ryan)
'What is it with you
and this case?'

37:45.667 --> 37:47.333
(Ryan)
'Detective.'

37:47.417 --> 37:49.417
Agent.

37:49.500 --> 37:51.834
Might wanna use the sink.

37:51.917 --> 37:53.792
Got blood on your hands.

37:53.875 --> 37:55.125
Thanks.

38:07.083 --> 38:08.417
- Lieutenant Stillman.
- Yeah?

38:08.500 --> 38:10.125
We got a location
on the suspect's van.

38:10.208 --> 38:12.041
- You're welcome to ride
along.
- Let's go.

38:12.125 --> 38:14.458
Honey, you can flash all
the badges you want at me.

38:14.542 --> 38:17.375
CIA, NSA, FBI.
The answer's no.

38:17.458 --> 38:19.917
Important to speak to him the
minute he gets out of surgery.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.709
Man lost a lot of blood.
He's flat-lined once already.

38:22.792 --> 38:24.709
Have a seat,
you read a Redbook

38:24.792 --> 38:27.458
and you wait your turn.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.875
Still got that blood
on your hand, detective.

38:47.959 --> 38:49.709
(Lilly)
'Uh, I was on my way
when I realized'

38:49.792 --> 38:52.583
I have Agent Yates' cellphone.

38:52.667 --> 38:54.542
Must've grabbed it
in the commotion.

38:54.625 --> 38:57.542
Detective, do you mind?

38:59.125 --> 39:01.333
- Sorry.
- Sure.

39:02.333 --> 39:04.083
Thank you.

39:06.542 --> 39:08.166
I wanna get back
to the part where you decide

39:08.250 --> 39:10.417
to misrepresent the bureau's
interest in this case.

39:10.500 --> 39:12.417
Lieutenant Stillman
and I are friends.

39:12.500 --> 39:13.917
I bet you are.

39:15.333 --> 39:17.417
- Problem, Yates?
- I got to hit the head.

39:17.500 --> 39:18.291
Oh.

39:18.375 --> 39:20.875
Men's room
is down that way.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.875
(Diane)
'What's going on?'

39:25.959 --> 39:27.792
Found this
in the clerk's truck.

39:31.542 --> 39:33.041
I'm driving.

39:40.375 --> 39:43.917
<i>Lista? Uno, dos, y tres.</i>

39:44.834 --> 39:45.709
Mmm.

39:45.792 --> 39:47.166
<i>- Oye.</i>
-

39:50.667 --> 39:52.792
Are you family?

39:52.875 --> 39:55.458
Niece. Is he going to make it?

39:55.542 --> 39:57.917
It's best to say goodbye
now.
He's conscious but..

39:58.000 --> 39:59.834
- Walt? Is this him?
- What the hell?

39:59.917 --> 40:02.208
Bill Shepard. Is this
the man with the PO box?

40:03.375 --> 40:04.333
No.

40:04.417 --> 40:05.583
(female #2)
'Crash cart!'

40:09.917 --> 40:12.834
Come out of the vehicle,
with your hands up!

40:12.917 --> 40:14.875
We have you surrounded.

40:14.959 --> 40:16.542
Give this guy a wakeup call.

40:20.083 --> 40:21.417
(male #3)
'I got no movement.'

40:21.500 --> 40:23.125
Standby.

40:23.208 --> 40:24.458
Go!

40:29.166 --> 40:30.417
Clear!

40:32.417 --> 40:33.500
Clear.

40:34.709 --> 40:36.083
Got no movement.

40:36.166 --> 40:37.583
Negative contact.

40:39.041 --> 40:40.000
(male #4)
'Copy that, it's clear.'

40:40.083 --> 40:42.208
'Alright, gents. Oscar, Mike.'

40:46.083 --> 40:47.250
This is it.

40:47.333 --> 40:48.792
Can't believe we missed it.

40:48.875 --> 40:50.583
No, we didn't.

40:50.667 --> 40:52.625
I meant the FBI.

41:01.625 --> 41:03.750
'Clear right.'

41:03.834 --> 41:06.166
'Clear left.'

41:06.250 --> 41:07.792
Well, looks like
he's been here.

41:18.417 --> 41:19.667
Here.

41:21.375 --> 41:22.458
.25-06.

41:22.542 --> 41:24.375
We gotta call this in.

41:24.458 --> 41:25.750
No. In a minute.

41:37.792 --> 41:41.208
(Diane)
'It's been a long time since
anyone's been down here.'

41:41.291 --> 41:44.250
- You okay?
- Yeah.

41:45.375 --> 41:46.458
(Lilly)
'Smell that?'

41:46.542 --> 41:47.792
Oh!

41:52.041 --> 41:53.583
(Diane)
'Another victim.'

41:57.750 --> 41:59.667
'Exit wound.'

41:59.750 --> 42:03.625
It looks self-inflicted.
Hand me that light.

42:11.250 --> 42:12.417
'Anything?'

42:13.166 --> 42:14.542
William Shepard.

42:17.250 --> 42:18.792
What the hell?

42:34.542 --> 42:36.458
Something the matter?

42:36.542 --> 42:38.625
I need to
borrow
your truck.

42:38.709 --> 42:39.959
I-I don't understand.

42:40.041 --> 42:42.792
Uh, is there something
I can help you with?
