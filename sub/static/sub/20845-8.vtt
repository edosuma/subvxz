00:00.250 --> 00:03.367
"The Carmichael Show" <i>is recorded
in front of a live studio audience.</i>

00:03.437 --> 00:05.530
I'm just sayin', every time

00:05.656 --> 00:09.109
we landed on the moon was
under the Nixon administration.

00:09.237 --> 00:12.742
It's been over 45 years
and still no other country has gone?

00:12.867 --> 00:15.109
None of that sounds
suspicious to y'all?

00:16.718 --> 00:19.249
Why would America manipulate
us like that?

00:19.304 --> 00:21.125
You know,
I'm not liking the picture

00:21.187 --> 00:23.265
you're painting
of this country.

00:23.562 --> 00:25.531
Yeah, even if we did fake
the moon landing,

00:25.593 --> 00:27.656
that just makes me love
America more.

00:27.812 --> 00:28.960
You know,

00:29.148 --> 00:31.759
lying about landing on the moon
is so American.

00:32.296 --> 00:34.070
But actually doing the work
and going there,

00:34.117 --> 00:36.476
that's kind of Japanese,
when you think about it.

00:37.906 --> 00:39.700
- Hey, y'all.
- Bobby, no!

00:39.781 --> 00:41.135
You are not at a point in your life

00:41.173 --> 00:42.859
where you get to wear
sunglasses inside.

00:42.999 --> 00:45.312
You got to
accomplish something first.

00:46.429 --> 00:47.742
Leave Bobby alone.

00:47.781 --> 00:50.531
He's working on his identity.

00:51.695 --> 00:55.101
Who do you think you are,
son, Jack Nicholson?

00:55.732 --> 00:57.874
Jack Nicholson has talent and class.

00:57.984 --> 01:00.445
Look at this boy.
He think he Jack Nicholson.

01:02.171 --> 01:04.107
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But you're not gonna be laughing

01:04.131 --> 01:05.921
when I tell you the reason why
I'm wearing these sunglasses.

01:05.945 --> 01:07.133
Why? What happened?

01:07.234 --> 01:08.867
- Is everything okay?
- No.

01:09.366 --> 01:12.765
Look, things got
a little crazy at home and...

01:14.342 --> 01:15.619
Nekeisha hit me.

01:15.660 --> 01:17.531
Oh, Bobby!

01:18.093 --> 01:19.640
Are you okay?

01:24.312 --> 01:26.523
Joe, why are you laughing?

01:26.812 --> 01:29.515
He just said
he got hit by a girl.

01:29.695 --> 01:30.890
That's not funny to y'all?

01:30.999 --> 01:33.453
No, it's not funny.
It's domestic abuse.

01:33.546 --> 01:35.539
Oh, yeah, you right.
We should...

01:35.671 --> 01:38.231
we should send Bobby
to a battered men's shelter!

01:42.064 --> 01:44.671
Joe, domestic violence is
real.

01:44.812 --> 01:46.804
It's also hard to prove.

01:46.921 --> 01:49.937
That's why we gonna have to put
more bruises on you, Bobby,

01:50.054 --> 01:52.671
if we want these charges to stick.

01:52.881 --> 01:55.421
Jerrod, put a couple
of oranges in a sock.

01:55.546 --> 01:58.882
Mom, we are not gonna jump Bobby.

01:59.023 --> 02:00.686
It's the only way.

02:00.789 --> 02:04.906
Sometimes you have to lie in
order for the truth to come out.

02:05.359 --> 02:08.085
Bobby, what happened?
Why did Nekeisha hit you?

02:08.632 --> 02:10.241
Nekeisha's been drinking
a lot lately,

02:10.320 --> 02:13.195
so I confronted her about it
and told her to cut back.

02:13.585 --> 02:14.726
Then, um,

02:14.851 --> 02:16.484
she punched me in the face.

02:17.140 --> 02:18.390
Oh, my poor baby.

02:18.492 --> 02:19.906
Nekeisha's out of control.

02:19.976 --> 02:22.632
You know something? From now on,
you are not leaving this house

02:22.701 --> 02:25.156
without my rape whistle.

02:27.007 --> 02:28.554
Maybe we should talk to her.

02:28.664 --> 02:31.546
No, you don't talk to a addict...
you yell at a addict.

02:31.640 --> 02:33.328
That's the only way
you can cut through

02:33.390 --> 02:36.281
the alcohol-fueled
screams in their head.

02:36.480 --> 02:39.539
You know what we could do?
We could throw her, uh,

02:39.671 --> 02:41.820
an intervention
prevention intervention.

02:42.937 --> 02:44.039
Dad,

02:44.109 --> 02:45.731
what the hell is that?

02:46.030 --> 02:49.078
An intervention prevention
intervention.

02:49.132 --> 02:51.171
That's like a
pre-intervention.

02:51.226 --> 02:54.859
It prevents us from having
to throw a real intervention.

02:55.078 --> 02:57.320
See, you got to attack
these things early.

02:57.414 --> 02:58.664
Because, most times,

02:58.703 --> 03:00.656
when people finally get
to a real intervention,

03:00.695 --> 03:01.884
- it's usually too late then.
- No.

03:01.908 --> 03:04.523
No, no, no, Dad, uh, uh,
quit trying to coin terms, okay?

03:04.584 --> 03:08.039
An intervention prevention
intervention is not a thing,

03:08.140 --> 03:09.588
and it will never be a thing.

03:09.679 --> 03:12.507
An I.P.I.
that's what we call it for short.

03:12.890 --> 03:16.156
Uh-oh, Bobby, Nekeisha
is pulling up outside.

03:16.251 --> 03:18.007
Okay, look,
nobody say anything.

03:18.085 --> 03:19.389
I don't want her to think
I'm snitching on her.

03:19.413 --> 03:21.601
No, I'm all riled up.

03:21.757 --> 03:23.679
This girl needs a good screaming at.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.999
Nothing restores a
man's self-esteem more

03:26.078 --> 03:28.289
than when his mom fights
his battles for him.

03:28.891 --> 03:30.289
No one's attacking her,

03:30.344 --> 03:31.824
and no one's gonna throw her
any sort

03:31.885 --> 03:33.398
of... prevention...

03:33.423 --> 03:36.937
Intervention prevention
intervention.

03:37.484 --> 03:40.234
Okay, um,
we're just gonna tell her

03:40.263 --> 03:41.749
that we love her,
and that we're worried

03:41.773 --> 03:43.367
about her drinking
becoming a problem.

03:43.492 --> 03:45.358
And that
if she's gonna hit Bobby,

03:45.429 --> 03:47.851
stick to body blows so
we won't have to deal with him

03:47.876 --> 03:50.065
wearing sunglasses inside.

03:50.537 --> 03:51.561
Hey, y'all.

03:51.640 --> 03:53.203
You bruised my baby's face,

03:53.274 --> 03:55.999
you alcoholic monster!

03:58.405 --> 03:59.842
Bobby, you've snitched?

04:00.170 --> 04:01.584
You snitch-ass ho.

04:20.783 --> 04:22.424
Now, Nekeisha,
you have a problem,

04:22.449 --> 04:23.492
and we gonna fix it.

04:23.517 --> 04:25.135
So sit
in the center of the room,

04:25.214 --> 04:27.127
and we gonna go around in a circle

04:27.267 --> 04:28.869
and judge you so harshly

04:28.986 --> 04:30.916
that you gonna feel
ashamed and broken,

04:30.994 --> 04:34.002
and you gonna change
your alcoholic ways,

04:34.078 --> 04:35.994
and you'll thank us
for saving your life.

04:37.126 --> 04:38.572
Okay, I'll go first.

04:38.679 --> 04:41.515
Nekeisha,
you are drinking too much,

04:41.765 --> 04:44.869
and your hair and nails
perpetuate a stereotype

04:44.927 --> 04:46.628
of low-income black women

04:46.676 --> 04:50.080
that I personally am
offended by.

04:50.963 --> 04:52.853
Look, Nekeisha,
we just really want to know

04:52.947 --> 04:54.572
if you're okay,
'cause you're drinking,

04:54.620 --> 04:55.650
and you're hitting Bobby.

04:55.727 --> 04:57.369
I wasn't drunk when I hit Bobby.

04:57.497 --> 04:59.150
If I was drunk,
I would have been relaxed,

04:59.174 --> 05:01.128
and none of this would have
happened in the first place.

05:01.152 --> 05:02.463
Wait, you weren't drunk?

05:02.614 --> 05:03.714
Bobby, I thought you said

05:03.777 --> 05:04.671
she'd been drinking too much.

05:04.736 --> 05:05.737
No, no, no,
I said she'd been

05:05.761 --> 05:08.304
drinking a lot <i>lately.</i>

05:09.000 --> 05:11.162
And that's why I poured
out all her liquor.

05:11.242 --> 05:12.887
- What they tellin' just happened?
- That changes everything.

05:12.911 --> 05:14.663
Why would you do
something like that?

05:14.952 --> 05:18.406
Bobby...
you poured her alcohol out?

05:18.646 --> 05:21.648
You lucky she didn't
bite part of your ear off.

05:21.853 --> 05:24.038
Thank you, Joe.
I came home from work,

05:24.133 --> 05:27.335
and he poured out two of my
brand-new bottles of Moet.

05:27.484 --> 05:29.812
Bobby,
you know you were not raised

05:29.860 --> 05:31.906
to be wasteful like that.

05:33.332 --> 05:35.374
Nekeisha, I am so sorry.

05:35.485 --> 05:37.742
Had I known,
I never would have said

05:37.815 --> 05:40.538
all those things
about you out loud.

05:41.421 --> 05:43.021
Bobby, what'd you think
was gonna happen?

05:43.101 --> 05:45.046
Wait, hold on a second,
don't blame Bobby

05:45.123 --> 05:46.484
for caring enough
about Nekeisha

05:46.612 --> 05:48.179
to try and
step up and do something.

05:48.274 --> 05:51.468
I don't know, Maxine,
the votes are in.

05:51.670 --> 05:52.835
I was wrong

05:52.868 --> 05:54.679
for pouring out Nekeisha's alcohol.

05:54.989 --> 05:56.796
Nekeisha, I'm sorry, okay?

05:56.882 --> 05:58.898
I will buy you
two new bottles of Moet

05:58.923 --> 06:00.891
when I get paid... we good?

06:01.002 --> 06:02.236
Yeah, we good.

06:02.315 --> 06:03.351
I probably went too far

06:03.413 --> 06:05.687
when I punched you
in the eye.

06:06.295 --> 06:08.396
All right, hug and make up, go on.

06:09.698 --> 06:11.445
Oh, that's nice.

06:11.624 --> 06:14.398
I'm so glad we could
fix our problems together

06:14.452 --> 06:16.726
as a family.

06:17.050 --> 06:19.852
It's like a episode of
<i>Black-ish.</i>

06:21.608 --> 06:23.379
You know,
I do feel a lot better.

06:23.523 --> 06:25.915
Thanks, everybody, for
pulling me through this mess.

06:26.265 --> 06:28.648
What is happening?

06:29.476 --> 06:31.656
The problem wasn't wasted alcohol.

06:31.710 --> 06:34.187
The problem was Nekeisha
drinking to excess.

06:34.351 --> 06:36.609
Nekeisha, how much
have you been drinking?

06:36.851 --> 06:39.726
Uh, well, usually I drink on Fridays,

06:39.798 --> 06:42.666
but then Thursday turned
into the new Friday.

06:42.761 --> 06:45.396
Then Wednesday turned
into the new Thursday.

06:45.498 --> 06:47.656
Shoot, I drink every night.

06:48.238 --> 06:49.968
Okay, well the healthy
guidelines say

06:50.051 --> 06:52.038
no more than two drinks
a night for a woman

06:52.063 --> 06:53.056
and three for a man.

06:53.081 --> 06:54.961
Well, that's just sexist.
See, that's what women

06:54.995 --> 06:57.304
need to be marching about,
right there.

06:57.429 --> 07:00.101
We need to be marching
about <i>that!</i>

07:01.377 --> 07:03.757
That's right. I mean,
if she can hit like a man,

07:03.820 --> 07:06.859
then, dammit, she should
be able to drink like one.

07:07.969 --> 07:10.265
Nekeisha, I'm not accusing
you of being an alcoholic,

07:10.333 --> 07:12.976
but is alcohol causing
any problems in your life?

07:13.230 --> 07:14.898
Like, are you
drinking and driving,

07:14.927 --> 07:15.984
or missing work?

07:16.009 --> 07:17.343
No, I'm on top of my game.

07:17.422 --> 07:19.790
I just got a promotion
last week.

07:20.101 --> 07:22.242
The TSA promoted you,
Nekeisha?

07:22.267 --> 07:24.249
Oh...

07:24.966 --> 07:26.788
That's wonderful news.

07:26.875 --> 07:28.656
Yep, you looking at the
new head

07:28.798 --> 07:30.966
of female pat-downs
in terminal "B"

07:31.013 --> 07:33.273
during red-eye hours.

07:36.201 --> 07:38.269
I know you've been
dreaming of getting

07:38.364 --> 07:40.178
this female pat-down
promotion for years.

07:40.507 --> 07:41.540
God is good.

07:41.572 --> 07:43.279
All the time.

07:43.684 --> 07:45.381
Well, this calls for
a celebration.

07:45.411 --> 07:47.623
I believe we got a bottle
of champagne in the kitchen.

07:47.648 --> 07:50.260
- I'm gonna go get it.
- Well, Joe, stop.

07:50.443 --> 07:51.728
I can't believe I have to say this.

07:51.752 --> 07:54.087
You can't serve alcohol
at an intervention.

07:54.287 --> 07:56.185
Well, that may be,
but right now,

07:56.234 --> 07:58.506
we in the middle of an I.P.I.C.

07:59.038 --> 08:02.451
An intervention prevention
intervention celebration.

08:04.472 --> 08:07.959
It doesn't sound like Nekeisha
has a problem, really.

08:08.027 --> 08:09.954
I mean, it's not like
she killed a family of four

08:09.978 --> 08:12.053
in some horrible
drunk-driving accident.

08:12.205 --> 08:14.756
Another thing to celebrate.
I'm gonna go pop that bubbly.

08:14.865 --> 08:17.154
No, no. Just because Nekeisha's

08:17.197 --> 08:19.959
functioning doesn't mean that
her alcohol use is healthy.

08:20.150 --> 08:23.170
Now, let's talk about
why you've been drinking more.

08:24.193 --> 08:25.725
Has there been anything

08:25.912 --> 08:28.178
stressful in
your personal life lately?

08:28.529 --> 08:29.717
Nothing too much.

08:29.746 --> 08:32.419
I mean, my sister did
just go back to jail,

08:32.567 --> 08:34.326
and now I'm taking care
of my little nephew,

08:34.370 --> 08:35.740
who was living with my mama.

08:35.859 --> 08:37.525
But then she started
doing drugs again,

08:37.650 --> 08:40.193
so, you know, it's just
regular-life stuff.

08:40.674 --> 08:42.865
Nekeisha, I'm so sorry.

08:42.980 --> 08:45.443
Was this the mom
I met at the wedding?

08:45.547 --> 08:47.920
No, that was my auntie,
who was taking care of me

08:47.967 --> 08:50.388
for, like, a year when
my foster-mom had died,

08:50.467 --> 08:52.115
just before my
grandmother had stepped in.

08:52.261 --> 08:55.318
Oh, so we're talking about
the second foster-mom.

08:55.533 --> 08:56.881
No, she's also dead.

08:56.951 --> 08:58.709
We're talking about
my actual mom.

08:59.006 --> 09:01.826
Oh, yeah, I think I met her.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.176
- You haven't.
- Oh, okay.

09:06.801 --> 09:09.256
Nekeisha, why didn't you
tell me your ma was

09:09.281 --> 09:10.311
back on drugs again?

09:10.336 --> 09:12.176
You know you can talk
to me about those things.

09:12.202 --> 09:14.131
I don't want to burden
anybody with my problems.

09:14.251 --> 09:16.857
I've been through this
all before... I can handle it.

09:16.982 --> 09:18.330
That's why I just have
a couple of drinks

09:18.354 --> 09:19.498
to help deal with it.

09:19.523 --> 09:20.723
Nekeisha,

09:20.748 --> 09:23.803
you are
the definition of a hero.

09:24.631 --> 09:28.568
Somebody who shoulders
all her pain on her own

09:28.623 --> 09:31.342
and doesn't ask me for
help getting through it.

09:31.866 --> 09:36.592
It just warms my heart that you
have such a good system in place.

09:36.732 --> 09:39.771
You know I read once,
that it is not the problems

09:39.847 --> 09:43.756
that arise but the grace in
which you suppress them.

09:43.856 --> 09:46.396
That... defines you.

09:47.573 --> 09:50.467
Oh, Mama, that was
poetry right there.

09:51.635 --> 09:55.498
No, it's not... and I strongly
doubt you read that any where.

09:55.571 --> 09:57.120
Yes, I did!

09:58.681 --> 10:02.115
You know, Nekeisha, hearing
about how painful your life

10:02.253 --> 10:04.374
has been and how well you've
hidden it from all of us.

10:04.435 --> 10:07.374
I say you've earned that bottle of
champagne, so I'm going to go get it.

10:07.443 --> 10:08.516
Get it, Joe.

10:08.592 --> 10:09.771
Jerrod, help me here.

10:09.858 --> 10:13.365
I don't know. Nekeisha's life
sounds like an episode of The Wire.

10:13.471 --> 10:16.170
I... guess
she should have a drink.

10:16.341 --> 10:18.787
The reality is, some
people's life is so

10:18.849 --> 10:20.842
stressful, they've earned
the right to drink.

10:20.958 --> 10:25.545
Some people drink. Others smoke
weed or cigarettes to deal with it.

10:25.637 --> 10:28.771
You know those chew commercials
only show the downside of smoking.

10:28.921 --> 10:31.482
They never show you the one guy
whose cigarette is the only

10:31.586 --> 10:34.662
thing stopping him beating his
wife after the Steelers lose.

10:35.076 --> 10:38.795
Now, Cynthia,
bought this bottle to celebrate

10:38.935 --> 10:41.020
for when Hillary was going
to win the presidency.

10:41.084 --> 10:47.553
But... I guess a woman being promoted
by the TSA is going to have to do.

10:49.106 --> 10:52.310
Look, Nekeisha, there are other ways
of handling stress than drinking.

10:52.370 --> 10:55.783
Like meditation.
I've been meditating since I was 10.

10:55.870 --> 10:58.521
Oh, when I was 10
my grandmother used to meditate.

10:58.617 --> 11:01.099
But, I found out later
she was just doing heroin.

11:03.237 --> 11:05.607
Well, nevertheless. Um...

11:06.545 --> 11:08.771
Meditation has done a lot
for me in my life.

11:08.853 --> 11:11.513
You know, I started meditating
the year my parent's got divorced.

11:11.615 --> 11:13.566
It was a really,
really stressful time.

11:13.652 --> 11:15.844
My parents wouldn't
take any responsibility.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.402
So, I put the blame on myself.

11:17.493 --> 11:19.957
And the only time I would get
any relief was when I

11:19.982 --> 11:22.113
would just sit alone in
my room and meditate.

11:22.316 --> 11:26.238
Maxine, you can't solve her problems
the way you solved your own problems.

11:26.426 --> 11:31.088
You got divorced parents. She got
2 dead Mommas and a junkie Nana.

11:33.639 --> 11:36.785
Maxine, if meditation
solved problems there

11:36.878 --> 11:40.324
wouldn't be so many
people starving in India.

11:41.104 --> 11:42.894
You know, just ignore them Nekeisha

11:42.980 --> 11:44.700
I really think
this would be great for you.

11:44.724 --> 11:46.128
What do you got to lose?

11:46.230 --> 11:47.612
Is this going
to cost me any money?

11:47.636 --> 11:48.652
No.

11:48.699 --> 11:51.929
And this won't be affecting my
sexual orientation, right?

11:54.208 --> 11:55.208
What?

11:56.798 --> 11:58.298
Alright, I'll try it.

11:58.492 --> 12:00.808
Okay, great. I really think
you're going to love this.

12:01.065 --> 12:03.231
You know, sometimes at night...

12:04.996 --> 12:07.847
when I'm laying down I hear
these voices in my head

12:07.902 --> 12:09.222
shouting at me.

12:10.324 --> 12:12.433
You're a failure, Bobby.

12:13.095 --> 12:14.574
You're nothing.

12:15.465 --> 12:17.394
You should just give it all up.

12:19.144 --> 12:21.543
So, I guess I'll try your meditation too.

12:24.543 --> 12:27.324
Okay, deep breaths. Inhale.

12:28.025 --> 12:29.503
Exhale.

12:31.027 --> 12:32.738
See, just by recognizing your breath,

12:32.824 --> 12:35.566
you can start to feel the
stress melt from your body.

12:36.222 --> 12:37.497
Now, I want you to picture

12:37.584 --> 12:38.618
a stream.

12:38.778 --> 12:42.230
Imagine leaves floating
down that stream.

12:42.512 --> 12:45.738
Place your problems one
by one onto the leaves,

12:45.763 --> 12:48.371
and just watch them slowly
drift away from you.

12:54.277 --> 12:56.590
Maxine? Hey, hey, Maxine?

12:56.660 --> 12:57.910
Yes, Bobby.

12:57.951 --> 13:01.769
Um... so I did what you said,
I put my problems on the leaf,

13:02.277 --> 13:03.408
and it started floating away,

13:03.432 --> 13:05.499
but now it's starting
to float back towards me.

13:05.719 --> 13:07.222
What should I do?

13:07.304 --> 13:08.684
Well, don't let it float towards you,

13:08.708 --> 13:10.287
make them float the other way.

13:10.469 --> 13:11.357
We can't control

13:11.358 --> 13:12.958
the way a stream moves, Maxine.

13:13.004 --> 13:14.305
We're not God.

13:18.106 --> 13:21.715
Oh, God, is anybody
else's stream disgusting?

13:22.208 --> 13:25.059
I think a factory's been
dumping runoff in mine.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.254
Okay, let's not do the stream.

13:27.700 --> 13:31.103
Um... all right, try this,
try picturing a mountain.

13:31.245 --> 13:32.433
Ooh, how high is this mountain?

13:32.457 --> 13:34.156
'Cause I'm afraid of heights.

13:34.300 --> 13:35.855
Oh, don't worry about that, Nekeisha,

13:35.887 --> 13:37.629
just put your fear
of heights on that leaf.

13:37.717 --> 13:39.919
Oh, you're right. Maxine,
I'm going back to the stream.

13:43.949 --> 13:45.559
Terry's awake.

13:46.022 --> 13:48.450
This is my nephew, Terry.
Terry, this is Maxine.

13:48.531 --> 13:50.645
I want some candy.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.732
Why do you always want candy?

13:52.973 --> 13:54.168
We ain't got no candy.

13:54.344 --> 13:56.021
Look, this boy's been over
here a whole damn week,

13:56.045 --> 13:57.552
and I ain't seen him eat one vegetable.

13:57.576 --> 13:59.649
Eat a carrot, Terry!

14:00.364 --> 14:01.434
Maxine,

14:01.497 --> 14:03.315
I know that you're trying to
get me to a state of peace,

14:03.339 --> 14:06.473
but this meditation thing
takes too much time and focus.

14:06.576 --> 14:09.747
Hennessy is relaxing immediately.

14:10.157 --> 14:11.950
But you don't want a quick fix,

14:12.012 --> 14:14.120
you have to look at
the big picture here.

14:14.458 --> 14:15.840
I found some candy.

14:15.911 --> 14:17.567
Terry, what is that?

14:17.723 --> 14:19.988
Um, did you go through my purse?

14:20.093 --> 14:21.285
I got to pee.

14:22.893 --> 14:26.051
Oh, Terry, would you stop
going through people's stuff?

14:26.215 --> 14:27.995
See, this is the reason
why you're not gonna find

14:28.019 --> 14:29.629
a loving home.

14:30.276 --> 14:31.552
Xanax?

14:31.738 --> 14:33.441
Maxine, you take Xanax?

14:33.607 --> 14:35.007
Yeah, sometimes.

14:35.118 --> 14:36.277
So let me get this straight.

14:36.302 --> 14:38.621
You got us sitting
around here Indian-style

14:38.730 --> 14:41.926
trying to replace alcohol
with streams and mountains

14:41.982 --> 14:45.262
while you're over there popping
happy pills the whole time?

14:45.378 --> 14:46.509
Yeah, Maxine,

14:46.574 --> 14:49.275
how's these pills any different
from Nekeisha's drinking?

14:49.371 --> 14:51.012
It's not the same as
drinking at all.

14:51.098 --> 14:53.254
A doctor prescribed
those as a sleep aid

14:53.293 --> 14:56.137
to help me with my ruminating
thoughts and anxiety.

14:56.316 --> 14:58.277
You know something?
See, I knew no one could just

14:58.438 --> 15:01.183
close their eyes and picture a stream

15:01.301 --> 15:03.602
without mind-enhancing steroids.

15:04.846 --> 15:07.433
There is no way that
I'm not drinking alcohol

15:07.481 --> 15:09.887
while you walking around here
with Xanax in your purse

15:09.943 --> 15:11.051
like breath mints.

15:11.102 --> 15:13.848
You said it was possible
to relax with just meditation.

15:13.899 --> 15:16.868
It is.
I am not taking Xanax all day.

15:17.009 --> 15:18.976
I take them at night as needed.

15:19.040 --> 15:21.041
Psh.

15:21.260 --> 15:23.494
Look, if it'll help you be more
invested in this process,

15:23.518 --> 15:24.721
then you keep them.

15:24.848 --> 15:26.541
You know,
I am fine without them.

15:26.625 --> 15:28.893
Let's try and get back
to our peaceful,

15:28.988 --> 15:30.588
meditative place, okay?

15:30.688 --> 15:31.888
Okay.

15:32.366 --> 15:33.737
This place is boring.

15:33.783 --> 15:36.791
I want to go live
with junkie Grandma.

15:41.708 --> 15:43.307
Oh, my God.

15:44.378 --> 15:46.592
Oh, my God, this is
so sad, I can't believe it.

15:46.746 --> 15:49.350
Maxine, what are you watching?

15:49.452 --> 15:50.655
It's the middle of the night.

15:50.884 --> 15:52.585
Just this episode of <i>VICE.</i>

15:52.680 --> 15:54.547
Jerrod, the world is really messed up.

15:54.721 --> 15:57.717
You don't watch <i>VICE at 3:00
in the morning, Maxine.</i>

15:57.757 --> 16:00.233
You either switch to porn
or you close your computer.

16:01.522 --> 16:03.382
Just... I can't sleep.

16:03.631 --> 16:05.561
I was thinking about
this co-worker of mine.

16:05.654 --> 16:08.350
We had this really weird moment
yesterday in a meeting.

16:08.526 --> 16:11.288
I said, "Good idea,"
and then she smiled at me.

16:11.428 --> 16:13.303
And I thought nothing
of it at the time,

16:13.373 --> 16:14.764
but now I'm replaying it
in my head

16:14.842 --> 16:17.178
and I'm wondering if she thought
maybe I was being sarcastic.

16:17.202 --> 16:18.712
So, in order to stop
thinking about that

16:18.736 --> 16:20.127
I started watching
this episode of <i>VICE</i>

16:20.151 --> 16:22.202
about child soldiers in South Sudan.

16:22.298 --> 16:26.421
And they have nine-year-olds
wielding machetes, Jerrod!

16:26.789 --> 16:27.956
Maxine,

16:28.561 --> 16:30.913
please take a Xanax.

16:31.775 --> 16:34.335
No, I made a deal with Nekeisha.

16:34.529 --> 16:36.999
There are other ways
of handling anxiety.

16:37.898 --> 16:39.832
Nine years old!

16:40.019 --> 16:42.652
Maxine, maybe they enjoy
being child soldiers,

16:42.777 --> 16:43.941
you ever think about that?

16:43.997 --> 16:46.488
I mean, if you gave me
a machete when I was a kid

16:46.558 --> 16:47.575
I'd be very excited.

16:47.662 --> 16:49.329
Now, stop watching that.

16:49.588 --> 16:50.922
I did.

16:51.207 --> 16:52.613
Now I'm just Googling stuff.

16:52.637 --> 16:54.871
Did you know that there are
eight active genocides

16:54.909 --> 16:56.258
happening in the world
right now?

16:56.283 --> 16:59.118
And they'll still be active
in the morning, I'm sure.

16:59.191 --> 17:02.188
Just... try and go to sleep.

17:04.203 --> 17:06.417
Jerrod, have you ever seen
a sinkhole actually open up

17:06.471 --> 17:09.699
and swallow a minivan with
an entire family inside?

17:09.723 --> 17:10.777
Here, watch.

17:10.801 --> 17:13.104
Maxine, what the hell
is wrong with you?

17:13.378 --> 17:15.753
Watching some family die in a sinkhole.

17:15.807 --> 17:17.571
Jerrod, don't shy away from the truth.

17:17.597 --> 17:20.239
People die in sinkholes
every single day.

17:22.589 --> 17:23.595
What are you doing?

17:23.660 --> 17:25.111
Maxine, I love you,

17:25.207 --> 17:26.902
but you are insufferable
without Xanax,

17:26.980 --> 17:29.621
so... I'm gonna get
high and go to sleep.

17:31.847 --> 17:33.515
We are so proud of you

17:33.621 --> 17:36.283
getting that promotion
from the TSA, Nekeisha.

17:36.383 --> 17:37.915
You got me a Qur'an?

17:37.991 --> 17:39.447
So you can better understand

17:39.493 --> 17:42.884
the Muslims you're gonna
be pulling out of line.

17:44.111 --> 17:45.624
That is so thoughtful.

17:45.745 --> 17:46.826
Look, we wanted to make sure

17:46.850 --> 17:48.602
if you're gonna racially
profile some people

17:48.702 --> 17:50.710
that you do it correctly.

17:51.335 --> 17:54.405
Nekeisha, Maxine's broken and
she's too proud to admit it.

17:54.452 --> 17:56.355
Will you please give
her back her Xanax?

17:56.403 --> 17:57.803
What... Jerrod.

17:58.052 --> 18:00.053
But, yeah, I want it back.

18:00.827 --> 18:03.671
Maxine, you're a pill-popper?

18:04.113 --> 18:05.405
No, I'm not a pill-popper,

18:05.483 --> 18:07.726
I take a medication
that is prescribed to me

18:07.827 --> 18:09.663
to help me sleep
when I have anxiety.

18:09.826 --> 18:11.902
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

18:12.025 --> 18:13.319
Oh, yeah.

18:14.311 --> 18:15.663
What?

18:15.866 --> 18:18.197
- Michael Jackson.
- Mm-hmm.

18:18.363 --> 18:21.082
- Pills killed our king.-
- Exactly what I was thinking.

18:21.168 --> 18:23.035
Okay, Xanax did not
kill Michael Jackson.

18:23.090 --> 18:25.340
He was taking a surgical
amount of anesthesia.

18:25.386 --> 18:29.996
Maxine, you have been after
Nekeisha to stop drinking

18:30.090 --> 18:33.326
and you are barely tethered
to the earth yourself?

18:33.547 --> 18:34.980
Mm-hmm.

18:35.043 --> 18:36.268
Looks like we've been doing

18:36.316 --> 18:39.379
this I.P.I. on
the wrong person all along.

18:39.675 --> 18:40.881
All right, Maxine,

18:40.967 --> 18:42.477
go on and sit in
the center of the room,

18:42.501 --> 18:44.004
we're gonna go around in a circle

18:44.062 --> 18:46.130
and take turns
shaming you into recovery.

18:46.226 --> 18:47.560
Right.

18:47.691 --> 18:49.683
I'll go first.

18:50.011 --> 18:51.206
Maxine,

18:51.410 --> 18:54.074
I think you're arrogant and unlikable,

18:54.285 --> 18:55.715
but I like your nails.

18:55.823 --> 18:57.090
Who's next?

18:58.193 --> 18:59.925
Okay, calm down, everyone.

19:00.043 --> 19:01.073
There's nothing wrong

19:01.074 --> 19:02.341
with Maxine taking Xanax.

19:02.546 --> 19:03.867
Lots of people do it.

19:04.023 --> 19:05.156
"Lots of people do it"

19:05.202 --> 19:06.554
is what they said about crack

19:06.656 --> 19:08.614
before it ruined Baltimore in the '80s.

19:09.547 --> 19:12.204
Have you seen Baltimore lately, Jerrod?

19:12.719 --> 19:15.211
It hasn't come back
from all that crack.

19:15.399 --> 19:17.305
Hey, hey, the world is stressful.

19:17.461 --> 19:19.234
And I think it's okay
that I need something

19:19.274 --> 19:20.774
to help me deal with that stress.

19:20.883 --> 19:22.836
I mean, do you know
how many active genocides

19:22.904 --> 19:24.767
there are happening
in the world right now?

19:24.894 --> 19:26.499
Eleven?

19:27.665 --> 19:29.268
Well, no, there are eight.

19:29.438 --> 19:32.352
Well, that's not so bad.

19:33.243 --> 19:34.680
Yeah, I was gonna guess 15.

19:34.782 --> 19:37.204
Well, it's good to know
there's a lot less genocide

19:37.377 --> 19:39.227
than we thought in the world.

19:39.672 --> 19:40.891
God is good.

19:40.917 --> 19:42.836
All the time, Mama.

19:42.861 --> 19:46.297
You guys do know
what genocide is, right?

19:46.954 --> 19:48.071
You know what?

19:48.184 --> 19:50.657
I don't care if you guys
judge me for taking Xanax

19:50.719 --> 19:53.041
because... guess what?

19:53.152 --> 19:55.409
I'm judging you for not taking them.

19:55.580 --> 19:58.316
This world is a terrible,
messed up place.

19:58.349 --> 20:00.550
How do you guys just sleep
at night and turn a blind eye

20:00.634 --> 20:02.234
to everything that's
going on around you?

20:02.307 --> 20:05.964
I take these pills because
I have a conscience and a heart.

20:06.339 --> 20:08.823
You all just must be dead inside.

20:09.405 --> 20:11.406
You're like the child soldiers
in the South Sudan,

20:11.478 --> 20:15.614
just getting through life...
ignoring all their feelings.

20:15.745 --> 20:17.650
Just waving those giant
machetes around

20:18.378 --> 20:20.553
in their tiny little hands.

20:25.225 --> 20:27.066
All right, peace, y'all.

20:34.912 --> 20:36.237
Hey, friends.

20:36.351 --> 20:38.182
When it comes to
drugs and alcohol,

20:38.231 --> 20:40.441
there are three words
that could save your life:

20:40.684 --> 20:42.685
"Just say when."

20:42.987 --> 20:44.704
Knowing your limits
is an important part

20:44.761 --> 20:45.904
of being an adult.

20:46.018 --> 20:48.464
You want to do just enough
to have fun at a party

20:48.511 --> 20:49.862
or be creative.

20:49.947 --> 20:52.214
But too much can send you
down the wrong path.

20:52.471 --> 20:55.409
Use substances, don't abuse substances.

20:55.658 --> 20:57.158
'Cause the more you know yourself,

20:57.316 --> 20:59.104
the more you know your limits.

20:59.775 --> 21:03.670
